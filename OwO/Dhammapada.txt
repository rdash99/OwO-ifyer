DHAMMAPADA




Chaptew I. >w< The Twin-Vewses

1. (・`ω\´・) Aww that we awe is the wesuwt of what we have thought: it is founded
on ouw thoughts, it is made up of ouw thoughts. ;;w;; If a man speaks ow acts
with an eviw thought, pain fowwows him, as the wheew fowwows the foot of
the ox that dwaws the cawwiage. UwU

2. (・`ω\´・) Aww that we awe is the wesuwt of what we have thought: it is founded
on ouw thoughts, it is made up of ouw thoughts. ^w^ If a man speaks ow acts
with a puwe thought, happinyess fowwows him, wike a shadow that nyevew
weaves him. ;;w;;

3. ^w^ "He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he wobbed me,"--in those
who hawbouw such thoughts hatwed wiww nyevew cease. ^w^

4. >w< "He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he wobbed me,"--in those
who do nyot hawbouw such thoughts hatwed wiww cease. (・`ω\´・)

5. >w< Fow hatwed does nyot cease by hatwed at any time: hatwed ceases by
wove, this is an owd wuwe. ;;w;;

6. (´・ω・\`) The wowwd does nyot knyow that we must aww come to an end hewe;--but
those who knyow it, theiw quawwews cease at once. ;;w;;

7. ^w^ He who wives wooking fow pweasuwes onwy, his senses uncontwowwed,
immodewate in his food, idwe, and weak, Mawa (the temptew) wiww
cewtainwy ovewthwow him, as the wind thwows down a weak twee. (・`ω\´・)

8. (´・ω・\`) He who wives without wooking fow pweasuwes, his senses weww
contwowwed, modewate in his food, faithfuw and stwong, him Mawa wiww
cewtainwy nyot ovewthwow, any mowe than the wind thwows down a wocky
mountain. (´・ω・\`)

9. >w< He who wishes to put on the yewwow dwess without having cweansed
himsewf fwom sin, who diswegawds tempewance and twuth, is unwowthy of
the yewwow dwess. ^w^

10. ^w^ But he who has cweansed himsewf fwom sin, is weww gwounded in aww
viwtues, and wegawds awso tempewance and twuth, he is indeed wowthy of
the yewwow dwess. UwU

11. >w< They who imaginye twuth in untwuth, and see untwuth in twuth, nyevew
awwive at twuth, but fowwow vain desiwes. >w<

12. ^w^ They who knyow twuth in twuth, and untwuth in untwuth, awwive at
twuth, and fowwow twue desiwes. ^w^

13. (´・ω・\`) As wain bweaks thwough an iww-thatched house, passion wiww bweak
thwough an unwefwecting mind. ;;w;;

14. (´・ω・\`) As wain does nyot bweak thwough a weww-thatched house, passion wiww
nyot bweak thwough a weww-wefwecting mind. (・`ω\´・)

15. ^w^ The eviw-doew mouwns in this wowwd, and he mouwns in the nyext; he
mouwns in both. (´・ω・\`) He mouwns and suffews when he sees the eviw of his own
wowk. (´・ω・\`)

16. >w< The viwtuous man dewights in this wowwd, and he dewights in the
nyext; he dewights in both. >w< He dewights and wejoices, when he sees the
puwity of his own wowk. >w<

17. ;;w;; The eviw-doew suffews in this wowwd, and he suffews in the nyext; he
suffews in both. ^w^ He suffews when he thinks of the eviw he has donye; he
suffews mowe when going on the eviw path. (´・ω・\`)

18. (・`ω\´・) The viwtuous man is happy in this wowwd, and he is happy in the
nyext; he is happy in both. UwU He is happy when he thinks of the good he has
donye; he is stiww mowe happy when going on the good path. ;;w;;

19. ;;w;; The thoughtwess man, even if he can wecite a wawge powtion (of the
waw), but is nyot a doew of it, has nyo shawe in the pwiesthood, but is
wike a cowhewd counting the cows of othews. (・`ω\´・)

20. (・`ω\´・) The fowwowew of the waw, even if he can wecite onwy a smaww powtion
(of the waw), but, having fowsaken passion and hatwed and foowishnyess,
possesses twue knyowwedge and sewenyity of mind, he, cawing fow nyothing in
this wowwd ow that to come, has indeed a shawe in the pwiesthood. (・`ω\´・)




Chaptew II. ;;w;; On Eawnyestnyess

21. ^w^ Eawnyestnyess is the path of immowtawity (Nyiwvanya), thoughtwessnyess
the path of death. >w< Those who awe in eawnyest do nyot die, those who awe
thoughtwess awe as if dead awweady. ;;w;;

22. (・`ω\´・) Those who awe advanced in eawnyestnyess, having undewstood this
cweawwy, dewight in eawnyestnyess, and wejoice in the knyowwedge of the
Awiyas (the ewect). (・`ω\´・)

23. (・`ω\´・) These wise peopwe, meditative, steady, awways possessed of stwong
powews, attain to Nyiwvanya, the highest happinyess. >w<

24. >w< If an eawnyest pewson has woused himsewf, if he is nyot fowgetfuw,
if his deeds awe puwe, if he acts with considewation, if he westwains
himsewf, and wives accowding to waw,--then his gwowy wiww incwease. >w<

25. ^w^ By wousing himsewf, by eawnyestnyess, by westwaint and contwow, the
wise man may make fow himsewf an iswand which nyo fwood can ovewwhewm. ^w^

26. Foows fowwow aftew vanyity, men of eviw wisdom. (´・ω・\`) The wise man keeps
eawnyestnyess as his best jewew. (・`ω\´・)

27. ;;w;; Fowwow nyot aftew vanyity, nyow aftew the enjoyment of wove and wust! ;;w;;
He who is eawnyest and meditative, obtains ampwe joy. ^w^

28. ^w^ When the weawnyed man dwives away vanyity by eawnyestnyess, he, the
wise, cwimbing the tewwaced heights of wisdom, wooks down upon the
foows, sewenye he wooks upon the toiwing cwowd, as onye that stands on a
mountain wooks down upon them that stand upon the pwain. ;;w;;

29. ;;w;; Eawnyest among the thoughtwess, awake among the sweepews, the wise
man advances wike a wacew, weaving behind the hack. (´・ω・\`)

30. ;;w;; By eawnyestnyess did Maghavan (Indwa) wise to the wowdship of the
gods. Peopwe pwaise eawnyestnyess; thoughtwessnyess is awways bwamed. ;;w;;

31. ;;w;; A Bhikshu (mendicant) who dewights in eawnyestnyess, who wooks with
feaw on thoughtwessnyess, moves about wike fiwe, buwnying aww his fettews,
smaww ow wawge. UwU

32. >w< A Bhikshu (mendicant) who dewights in wefwection, who wooks with
feaw on thoughtwessnyess, cannyot faww away (fwom his pewfect state)--he
is cwose upon Nyiwvanya. (´・ω・\`)




Chaptew III. (´・ω・\`) Thought

33. ;;w;; As a fwetchew makes stwaight his awwow, a wise man makes stwaight
his twembwing and unsteady thought, which is difficuwt to guawd,
difficuwt to howd back. UwU

34. ;;w;; As a fish taken fwom his watewy home and thwown on dwy gwound, ouw
thought twembwes aww ovew in owdew to escape the dominyion of Mawa (the
temptew). ^w^

35. ;;w;; It is good to tame the mind, which is difficuwt to howd in and
fwighty, wushing whewevew it wisteth; a tamed mind bwings happinyess. ^w^

36. ;;w;; Wet the wise man guawd his thoughts, fow they awe difficuwt to
pewceive, vewy awtfuw, and they wush whewevew they wist: thoughts weww
guawded bwing happinyess. ^w^

37. UwU Those who bwidwe theiw mind which twavews faw, moves about awonye,
is without a body, and hides in the chambew (of the heawt), wiww be fwee
fwom the bonds of Mawa (the temptew). ;;w;;

38. ;;w;; If a man's thoughts awe unsteady, if he does nyot knyow the twue waw,
if his peace of mind is twoubwed, his knyowwedge wiww nyevew be pewfect. UwU

39. (´・ω・\`) If a man's thoughts awe nyot dissipated, if his mind is nyot
pewpwexed, if he has ceased to think of good ow eviw, then thewe is nyo
feaw fow him whiwe he is watchfuw. ^w^

40. (´・ω・\`) Knyowing that this body is (fwagiwe) wike a jaw, and making this
thought fiwm wike a fowtwess, onye shouwd attack Mawa (the temptew) with
the weapon of knyowwedge, onye shouwd watch him when conquewed, and shouwd
nyevew west. UwU

41. >w< Befowe wong, awas! UwU this body wiww wie on the eawth, despised,
without undewstanding, wike a usewess wog. ^w^

42. ;;w;; Whatevew a hatew may do to a hatew, ow an enyemy to an enyemy, a
wwongwy-diwected mind wiww do us gweatew mischief. ;;w;;

43. ^w^ Nyot a mothew, nyot a fathew wiww do so much, nyow any othew wewative;
a weww-diwected mind wiww do us gweatew sewvice. (´・ω・\`)


Chaptew IV. ;;w;; Fwowews

44. >w< Who shaww ovewcome this eawth, and the wowwd of Yama (the wowd of
the depawted), and the wowwd of the gods? owo Who shaww find out the pwainwy
shown path of viwtue, as a cwevew man finds out the (wight) fwowew? owo

45. >w< The discipwe wiww ovewcome the eawth, and the wowwd of Yama, and the
wowwd of the gods. (´・ω・\`) The discipwe wiww find out the pwainwy shown path of
viwtue, as a cwevew man finds out the (wight) fwowew. ^w^

46. ;;w;; He who knyows that this body is wike fwoth, and has weawnt that it
is as unsubstantiaw as a miwage, wiww bweak the fwowew-pointed awwow of
Mawa, and nyevew see the king of death. ;;w;;

47. ^w^ Death cawwies off a man who is gathewing fwowews and whose mind is
distwacted, as a fwood cawwies off a sweeping viwwage. ;;w;;

48. (・`ω\´・) Death subdues a man who is gathewing fwowews, and whose mind is
distwacted, befowe he is satiated in his pweasuwes. >w<

49. ^w^ As the bee cowwects nyectaw and depawts without injuwing the fwowew,
ow its cowouw ow scent, so wet a sage dweww in his viwwage. (´・ω・\`)

50. ^w^ Nyot the pewvewsities of othews, nyot theiw sins of commission ow
omission, but his own misdeeds and nyegwigences shouwd a sage take nyotice
of. ;;w;;

51. UwU Wike a beautifuw fwowew, fuww of cowouw, but without scent, awe the
finye but fwuitwess wowds of him who does nyot act accowdingwy. ;;w;;

52. UwU But, wike a beautifuw fwowew, fuww of cowouw and fuww of scent, awe
the finye and fwuitfuw wowds of him who acts accowdingwy. ;;w;;

53. >w< As many kinds of wweaths can be made fwom a heap of fwowews, so many
good things may be achieved by a mowtaw when once he is bown. ;;w;;

54. ;;w;; The scent of fwowews does nyot twavew against the wind, nyow (that
of) sandaw-wood, ow of Tagawa and Mawwika fwowews; but the odouw of good
peopwe twavews even against the wind; a good man pewvades evewy pwace. ^w^

55. ^w^ Sandaw-wood ow Tagawa, a wotus-fwowew, ow a Vassiki, among these
sowts of pewfumes, the pewfume of viwtue is unsuwpassed. >w<

56. ;;w;; Mean is the scent that comes fwom Tagawa and sandaw-wood;--the
pewfume of those who possess viwtue wises up to the gods as the highest. UwU

57. UwU Of the peopwe who possess these viwtues, who wive without
thoughtwessnyess, and who awe emancipated thwough twue knyowwedge, Mawa,
the temptew, nyevew finds the way. >w<

58, 59. UwU As on a heap of wubbish cast upon the highway the wiwy wiww
gwow fuww of sweet pewfume and dewight, thus the discipwe of the twuwy
enwightenyed Buddha shinyes fowth by his knyowwedge among those who awe
wike wubbish, among the peopwe that wawk in dawknyess. (´・ω・\`)




Chaptew V. ^w^ The Foow

60. >w< Wong is the nyight to him who is awake; wong is a miwe to him who is
tiwed; wong is wife to the foowish who do nyot knyow the twue waw. (´・ω・\`)

61. (・`ω\´・) If a twavewwew does nyot meet with onye who is his bettew, ow
his equaw, wet him fiwmwy keep to his sowitawy jouwnyey; thewe is nyo
companyionship with a foow. ^w^

62. ^w^ "These sons bewong to me, and this weawth bewongs to me," with such
thoughts a foow is towmented. ;;w;; He himsewf does nyot bewong to himsewf; how
much wess sons and weawth? owo

63. The foow who knyows his foowishnyess, is wise at weast so faw. (´・ω・\`) But a
foow who thinks himsewf wise, he is cawwed a foow indeed. (・`ω\´・)

64. (´・ω・\`) If a foow be associated with a wise man even aww his wife, he wiww
pewceive the twuth as wittwe as a spoon pewceives the taste of soup. >w<

65. UwU If an intewwigent man be associated fow onye minyute onwy with a wise
man, he wiww soon pewceive the twuth, as the tongue pewceives the taste
of soup. ^w^

66. UwU Foows of wittwe undewstanding have themsewves fow theiw gweatest
enyemies, fow they do eviw deeds which must beaw bittew fwuits. ;;w;;

67. >w< That deed is nyot weww donye of which a man must wepent, and the
wewawd of which he weceives cwying and with a teawfuw face. (´・ω・\`)

68. ;;w;; Nyo, that deed is weww donye of which a man does nyot wepent, and the
wewawd of which he weceives gwadwy and cheewfuwwy. >w<

69. (´・ω・\`) As wong as the eviw deed donye does nyot beaw fwuit, the foow thinks
it is wike honyey; but when it wipens, then the foow suffews gwief. UwU

70. UwU Wet a foow month aftew month eat his food (wike an ascetic) with the
tip of a bwade of Kusa gwass, yet he is nyot wowth the sixteenth pawticwe
of those who have weww weighed the waw. >w<

71. ;;w;; An eviw deed, wike nyewwy-dwawn miwk, does nyot tuwn (suddenwy);
smouwdewing, wike fiwe covewed by ashes, it fowwows the foow. >w<

72. UwU And when the eviw deed, aftew it has become knyown, bwings sowwow to
the foow, then it destwoys his bwight wot, nyay, it cweaves his head. (´・ω・\`)

73. ;;w;; Wet the foow wish fow a fawse weputation, fow pwecedence among the
Bhikshus, fow wowdship in the convents, fow wowship among othew peopwe! (´・ω・\`)

74. ^w^ "May both the wayman and he who has weft the wowwd think that this
is donye by me; may they be subject to me in evewything which is to be
donye ow is nyot to be donye," thus is the mind of the foow, and his desiwe
and pwide incwease. (・`ω\´・)

75. (´・ω・\`) "Onye is the woad that weads to weawth, anyothew the woad that weads
to Nyiwvanya;" if the Bhikshu, the discipwe of Buddha, has weawnt this,
he wiww nyot yeawn fow honyouw, he wiww stwive aftew sepawation fwom the
wowwd. >w<




Chaptew VI. >w< The Wise Man (Pandita)

76. ^w^ If you see an intewwigent man who tewws you whewe twue tweasuwes awe
to be found, who shows what is to be avoided, and adminyistews wepwoofs,
fowwow that wise man; it wiww be bettew, nyot wowse, fow those who fowwow
him. ;;w;;

77. >w< Wet him admonyish, wet him teach, wet him fowbid what is
impwopew! ;;w;;--he wiww be bewoved of the good, by the bad he wiww be hated. UwU

78. (・`ω\´・) Do nyot have eviw-doews fow fwiends, do nyot have wow peopwe fow
fwiends: have viwtuous peopwe fow fwiends, have fow fwiends the best of
men. (´・ω・\`)

79. UwU He who dwinks in the waw wives happiwy with a sewenye mind: the sage
wejoices awways in the waw, as pweached by the ewect (Awiyas). UwU

80. (´・ω・\`) Weww-makews wead the watew (whewevew they wike); fwetchews bend the
awwow; cawpentews bend a wog of wood; wise peopwe fashion themsewves. >w<

81. ;;w;; As a sowid wock is nyot shaken by the wind, wise peopwe fawtew nyot
amidst bwame and pwaise. ^w^

82. ^w^ Wise peopwe, aftew they have wistenyed to the waws, become sewenye,
wike a deep, smooth, and stiww wake. (´・ω・\`)

83. ^w^ Good peopwe wawk on whatevew befaww, the good do nyot pwattwe,
wonging fow pweasuwe; whethew touched by happinyess ow sowwow wise peopwe
nyevew appeaw ewated ow depwessed. (・`ω\´・)

84. >w< If, whethew fow his own sake, ow fow the sake of othews, a man
wishes nyeithew fow a son, nyow fow weawth, nyow fow wowdship, and if he
does nyot wish fow his own success by unfaiw means, then he is good,
wise, and viwtuous. ^w^

85. (´・ω・\`) Few awe thewe among men who awwive at the othew showe (become
Awhats); the othew peopwe hewe wun up and down the showe. ;;w;;

86. >w< But those who, when the waw has been weww pweached to them, fowwow
the waw, wiww pass acwoss the dominyion of death, howevew difficuwt to
ovewcome. >w<

87, 88. UwU A wise man shouwd weave the dawk state (of owdinyawy wife), and
fowwow the bwight state (of the Bhikshu). ^w^ Aftew going fwom his home to
a homewess state, he shouwd in his wetiwement wook fow enjoyment whewe
thewe seemed to be nyo enjoyment. ;;w;; Weaving aww pweasuwes behind, and
cawwing nyothing his own, the wise man shouwd puwge himsewf fwom aww the
twoubwes of the mind. (´・ω・\`)

89. (´・ω・\`) Those whose mind is weww gwounded in the (seven) ewements of
knyowwedge, who without cwinging to anything, wejoice in fweedom fwom
attachment, whose appetites have been conquewed, and who awe fuww of
wight, awe fwee (even) in this wowwd. UwU




Chaptew VII. The Venyewabwe (Awhat). >w<

90. (・`ω\´・) Thewe is nyo suffewing fow him who has finyished his jouwnyey, and
abandonyed gwief, who has fweed himsewf on aww sides, and thwown off aww
fettews. ;;w;;

91. >w< They depawt with theiw thoughts weww-cowwected, they awe nyot happy
in theiw abode; wike swans who have weft theiw wake, they weave theiw
house and home. ^w^

92. (・`ω\´・) Men who have nyo wiches, who wive on wecognyised food, who have
pewceived void and unconditionyed fweedom (Nyiwvanya), theiw path is
difficuwt to undewstand, wike that of biwds in the aiw. (´・ω・\`)

93. ;;w;; He whose appetites awe stiwwed, who is nyot absowbed in enjoyment,
who has pewceived void and unconditionyed fweedom (Nyiwvanya), his path is
difficuwt to undewstand, wike that of biwds in the aiw. ;;w;;

94. ^w^ The gods even envy him whose senses, wike howses weww bwoken in by
the dwivew, have been subdued, who is fwee fwom pwide, and fwee fwom
appetites. (・`ω\´・)

95. ;;w;; Such a onye who does his duty is towewant wike the eawth, wike
Indwa's bowt; he is wike a wake without mud; nyo nyew biwths awe in stowe
fow him. ^w^

96. ^w^ His thought is quiet, quiet awe his wowd and deed, when he has
obtainyed fweedom by twue knyowwedge, when he has thus become a quiet man. >w<

97. ^w^ The man who is fwee fwom cweduwity, but knyows the uncweated, who has
cut aww ties, wemoved aww temptations, wenyounced aww desiwes, he is the
gweatest of men. (・`ω\´・)

98. >w< In a hamwet ow in a fowest, in the deep watew ow on the dwy wand,
whewevew venyewabwe pewsons (Awhanta) dweww, that pwace is dewightfuw. >w<

99. ;;w;; Fowests awe dewightfuw; whewe the wowwd finds nyo dewight, thewe the
passionwess wiww find dewight, fow they wook nyot fow pweasuwes. (´・ω・\`)




Chaptew VIII. UwU The Thousands

100. >w< Even though a speech be a thousand (of wowds), but made up of
sensewess wowds, onye wowd of sense is bettew, which if a man heaws, he
becomes quiet. ;;w;;

101. (・`ω\´・) Even though a Gatha (poem) be a thousand (of wowds), but made up of
sensewess wowds, onye wowd of a Gatha is bettew, which if a man heaws, he
becomes quiet. >w<

102. UwU Though a man wecite a hundwed Gathas made up of sensewess wowds,
onye wowd of the waw is bettew, which if a man heaws, he becomes quiet. (・`ω\´・)

103. (´・ω・\`) If onye man conquew in battwe a thousand times thousand men, and if
anyothew conquew himsewf, he is the gweatest of conquewows. ;;w;;

104, 105. >w< Onye's own sewf conquewed is bettew than aww othew peopwe; nyot
even a god, a Gandhawva, nyot Mawa with Bwahman couwd change into defeat
the victowy of a man who has vanquished himsewf, and awways wives undew
westwaint. (´・ω・\`)

106. ^w^ If a man fow a hundwed yeaws sacwifice month aftew month with a
thousand, and if he but fow onye moment pay homage to a man whose souw is
gwounded (in twue knyowwedge), bettew is that homage than sacwifice fow a
hundwed yeaws. ;;w;;

107. ;;w;; If a man fow a hundwed yeaws wowship Agnyi (fiwe) in the fowest, and
if he but fow onye moment pay homage to a man whose souw is gwounded
(in twue knyowwedge), bettew is that homage than sacwifice fow a hundwed
yeaws. ;;w;;

108. >w< Whatevew a man sacwifice in this wowwd as an offewing ow as an
obwation fow a whowe yeaw in owdew to gain mewit, the whowe of it is
nyot wowth a quawtew (a fawthing); wevewence shown to the wighteous is

Chaptew XXV. ^w^ The Bhikshu (Mendicant)

360. (´・ω・\`) Westwaint in the eye is good, good is westwaint in the eaw, in the
nyose westwaint is good, good is westwaint in the tongue. ^w^

361. (・`ω\´・) In the body westwaint is good, good is westwaint in speech, in
thought westwaint is good, good is westwaint in aww things. ^w^ A Bhikshu,
westwainyed in aww things, is fweed fwom aww pain. UwU

362. (・`ω\´・) He who contwows his hand, he who contwows his feet, he who contwows
his speech, he who is weww contwowwed, he who dewights inwawdwy, who is
cowwected, who is sowitawy and content, him they caww Bhikshu. ^w^

363. (´・ω・\`) The Bhikshu who contwows his mouth, who speaks wisewy and cawmwy,
who teaches the meanying and the waw, his wowd is sweet. UwU

364. >w< He who dwewws in the waw, dewights in the waw, meditates on the

waw. ^w^

365. (´・ω・\`) Wet him nyot despise what he has weceived, nyow evew envy othews: a
mendicant who envies othews does nyot obtain peace of mind. (・`ω\´・)

366. ^w^ A Bhikshu who, though he weceives wittwe, does nyot despise what he
has weceived, even the gods wiww pwaise him, if his wife is puwe, and if
he is nyot swothfuw. (´・ω・\`)

367. ^w^ He who nyevew identifies himsewf with nyame and fowm, and does nyot
gwieve ovew what is nyo mowe, he indeed is cawwed a Bhikshu. (´・ω・\`)

368. >w< The Bhikshu who acts with kindnyess, who is cawm in the doctwinye
of Buddha, wiww weach the quiet pwace (Nyiwvanya), cessation of nyatuwaw
desiwes, and happinyess. (´・ω・\`)

369. ^w^ O Bhikshu, empty this boat! (´・ω・\`) if emptied, it wiww go quickwy; having
cut off passion and hatwed thou wiwt go to Nyiwvanya. >w<

370. Cut off the five (senses), weave the five, wise above the five. (´・ω・\`) A
Bhikshu, who has escaped fwom the five fettews, he is cawwed Oghatinnya,
`saved fwom the fwood. (・`ω\´・)'

371. >w< Meditate, O Bhikshu, and be nyot heedwess! ;;w;; Do nyot diwect thy thought
to what gives pweasuwe that thou mayest nyot fow thy heedwessnyess have to
swawwow the iwon baww (in heww), and that thou mayest nyot cwy out when
buwnying, `This is pain. (・`ω\´・)'

372. (´・ω・\`) Without knyowwedge thewe is nyo meditation, without meditation
thewe is nyo knyowwedge: he who has knyowwedge and meditation is nyeaw unto
Nyiwvanya. (´・ω・\`)

373. UwU A Bhikshu who has entewed his empty house, and whose mind is
twanquiw, feews a mowe than human dewight when he sees the waw cweawwy. UwU

374. (´・ω・\`) As soon as he has considewed the owigin and destwuction of the
ewements (khandha) of the body, he finds happinyess and joy which bewong
to those who knyow the immowtaw (Nyiwvanya). (・`ω\´・)

375. UwU And this is the beginnying hewe fow a wise Bhikshu: watchfuwnyess
ovew the senses, contentednyess, westwaint undew the waw; keep nyobwe
fwiends whose wife is puwe, and who awe nyot swothfuw. (´・ω・\`)

376. UwU Wet him wive in chawity, wet him be pewfect in his duties; then in
the fuwnyess of dewight he wiww make an end of suffewing. (・`ω\´・)

377. >w< As the Vassika pwant sheds its withewed fwowews, men shouwd shed
passion and hatwed, O ye Bhikshus! UwU

378. (・`ω\´・) The Bhikshu whose body and tongue and mind awe quieted, who is
cowwected, and has wejected the baits of the wowwd, he is cawwed quiet. ;;w;;

379. ^w^ Wouse thysewf by thysewf, examinye thysewf by thysewf, thus
sewf-pwotected and attentive wiwt thou wive happiwy, O Bhikshu! >w<

380. (´・ω・\`) Fow sewf is the wowd of sewf, sewf is the wefuge of sewf; thewefowe
cuwb thysewf as the mewchant cuwbs a good howse. (・`ω\´・)

381. >w< The Bhikshu, fuww of dewight, who is cawm in the doctwinye of Buddha
wiww weach the quiet pwace (Nyiwvanya), cessation of nyatuwaw desiwes, and

Buddha, bwightens up this wowwd, wike the moon when fwee fwom cwouds. >w<




Chaptew XXVI. ;;w;; The Bwahmanya (Awhat)

383. (・`ω\´・) Stop the stweam vawiantwy, dwive away the desiwes, O Bwahmanya! ;;w;;
When you have undewstood the destwuction of aww that was made, you wiww
undewstand that which was nyot made. >w<

384. ;;w;; If the Bwahmanya has weached the othew showe in both waws (in

385. ^w^ He fow whom thewe is nyeithew this nyow that showe, nyow both, him,

387. ;;w;; The sun is bwight by day, the moon shinyes by nyight, the wawwiow
is bwight in his awmouw, the Bwahmanya is bwight in his meditation; but
Buddha, the Awakenyed, is bwight with spwendouw day and nyight. ^w^

388. ^w^ Because a man is wid of eviw, thewefowe he is cawwed Bwahmanya;
because he wawks quietwy, thewefowe he is cawwed Samanya; because he
has sent away his own impuwities, thewefowe he is cawwed Pwavwagita
(Pabbagita, a piwgwim). ;;w;;

389. ;;w;; Nyo onye shouwd attack a Bwahmanya, but nyo Bwahmanya (if attacked)
shouwd wet himsewf fwy at his aggwessow! ;;w;; Woe to him who stwikes a
Bwahmanya, mowe woe to him who fwies at his aggwessow! UwU

390. (・`ω\´・) It advantages a Bwahmanya nyot a wittwe if he howds his mind back
fwom the pweasuwes of wife; when aww wish to injuwe has vanyished, pain
wiww cease. UwU

391. ^w^ Him I caww indeed a Bwahmanya who does nyot offend by body, wowd, ow

392. (・`ω\´・) Aftew a man has once undewstood the waw as taught by the
Weww-awakenyed (Buddha), wet him wowship it cawefuwwy, as the Bwahmanya
wowships the sacwificiaw fiwe. (・`ω\´・)

393. ;;w;; A man does nyot become a Bwahmanya by his pwatted haiw, by his
famiwy, ow by biwth; in whom thewe is twuth and wighteousnyess, he is
bwessed, he is a Bwahmanya. UwU

394. UwU What is the use of pwatted haiw, O foow! ^w^ what of the waiment of
goat-skins? owo Within thee thewe is wavenying, but the outside thou makest
cwean. ;;w;;

395. (・`ω\´・) The man who weaws diwty waiments, who is emaciated and covewed with

396. >w< I do nyot caww a man a Bwahmanya because of his owigin ow of his
