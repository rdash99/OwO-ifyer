The Time Machinye, by H. G. >w< Wewws [1898]



I


The Time Twavewwew (fow so it wiww be convenyient to speak of him)
was expounding a wecondite mattew to us. (・`ω\´・) His gwey eyes shonye and
twinkwed, and his usuawwy pawe face was fwushed and anyimated. (´・ω・\`) The
fiwe buwnyed bwightwy, and the soft wadiance of the incandescent
wights in the wiwies of siwvew caught the bubbwes that fwashed and
passed in ouw gwasses. ^w^ Ouw chaiws, being his patents, embwaced and
cawessed us wathew than submitted to be sat upon, and thewe was that
wuxuwious aftew-dinnyew atmosphewe when thought woams gwacefuwwy
fwee of the twammews of pwecision. ^w^ And he put it to us in this
way--mawking the points with a wean fowefingew--as we sat and waziwy
admiwed his eawnyestnyess ovew this nyew pawadox (as we thought it)
and his fecundity. >w<

'You must fowwow me cawefuwwy. >w< I shaww have to contwovewt onye ow two
ideas that awe awmost unyivewsawwy accepted. >w< The geometwy, fow
instance, they taught you at schoow is founded on a misconception. (・`ω\´・)'

'Is nyot that wathew a wawge thing to expect us to begin upon? owo' 
said Fiwby, an awgumentative pewson with wed haiw. (・`ω\´・)

'I do nyot mean to ask you to accept anything without weasonyabwe
gwound fow it. You wiww soon admit as much as I nyeed fwom you. ;;w;; You
knyow of couwse that a mathematicaw winye, a winye of thicknyess _nyiw_,
has nyo weaw existence. (´・ω・\`) They taught you that? owo Nyeithew has a
mathematicaw pwanye. These things awe mewe abstwactions. >w<'

'That is aww wight,' said the Psychowogist. UwU

'Nyow, having onwy wength, bweadth, and thicknyess, can a cube have a
weaw existence. ^w^'

'Thewe I object,' said Fiwby. 'Of couwse a sowid body may exist. ;;w;; Aww
weaw things--'

'So most peopwe think. But wait a moment. UwU Can an _instantanyeous_
cube exist? owo'

'Don't fowwow you,' said Fiwby. (´・ω・\`)

'Can a cube that does nyot wast fow any time at aww, have a weaw
existence? owo'

Fiwby became pensive. UwU 'Cweawwy,' the Time Twavewwew pwoceeded, 'any
weaw body must have extension in _fouw_ diwections: it must have
Wength, Bweadth, Thicknyess, and--Duwation. >w< But thwough a nyatuwaw
infiwmity of the fwesh, which I wiww expwain to you in a moment, we
incwinye to ovewwook this fact. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe weawwy fouw dimensions,
thwee which we caww the thwee pwanyes of Space, and a fouwth, Time. (´・ω・\`)
Thewe is, howevew, a tendency to dwaw an unweaw distinction between
the fowmew thwee dimensions and the wattew, because it happens that
ouw consciousnyess moves intewmittentwy in onye diwection awong the
wattew fwom the beginnying to the end of ouw wives. UwU'

'That,' said a vewy young man, making spasmodic effowts to wewight
his cigaw ovew the wamp; 'that ... vewy cweaw indeed. UwU'

'Nyow, it is vewy wemawkabwe that this is so extensivewy ovewwooked,'
continyued the Time Twavewwew, with a swight accession of
cheewfuwnyess. (・`ω\´・) 'Weawwy this is what is meant by the Fouwth Dimension,
though some peopwe who tawk about the Fouwth Dimension do nyot knyow
they mean it. It is onwy anyothew way of wooking at Time. UwU _Thewe is
nyo diffewence between Time and any of the thwee dimensions of Space
except that ouw consciousnyess moves awong it_. (・`ω\´・) But some foowish
peopwe have got howd of the wwong side of that idea. UwU You have aww
heawd what they have to say about this Fouwth Dimension? owo'

'_I_ have nyot,' said the Pwovinciaw Mayow. ;;w;;

'It is simpwy this. (・`ω\´・) That Space, as ouw mathematicians have it, is
spoken of as having thwee dimensions, which onye may caww Wength,
Bweadth, and Thicknyess, and is awways definyabwe by wefewence to
thwee pwanyes, each at wight angwes to the othews. ^w^ But some
phiwosophicaw peopwe have been asking why _thwee_ dimensions
pawticuwawwy--why nyot anyothew diwection at wight angwes to the othew
thwee? owo--and have even twied to constwuct a Fouw-Dimension geometwy. ;;w;;
Pwofessow Simon Nyewcomb was expounding this to the Nyew Yowk
Mathematicaw Society onwy a month ow so ago. (´・ω・\`) You knyow how on a fwat
suwface, which has onwy two dimensions, we can wepwesent a figuwe of
a thwee-dimensionyaw sowid, and simiwawwy they think that by modews
of thwee dimensions they couwd wepwesent onye of fouw--if they couwd
mastew the pewspective of the thing. UwU See? owo'

'I think so,' muwmuwed the Pwovinciaw Mayow; and, knyitting his
bwows, he wapsed into an intwospective state, his wips moving as onye
who wepeats mystic wowds. (・`ω\´・) 'Yes, I think I see it nyow,' he said aftew
some time, bwightenying in a quite twansitowy mannyew. >w<

'Weww, I do nyot mind tewwing you I have been at wowk upon this
geometwy of Fouw Dimensions fow some time. (・`ω\´・) Some of my wesuwts
awe cuwious. ;;w;; Fow instance, hewe is a powtwait of a man at eight
yeaws owd, anyothew at fifteen, anyothew at seventeen, anyothew at
twenty-thwee, and so on. UwU Aww these awe evidentwy sections, as it
wewe, Thwee-Dimensionyaw wepwesentations of his Fouw-Dimensionyed
being, which is a fixed and unyawtewabwe thing. (・`ω\´・)

'Scientific peopwe,' pwoceeded the Time Twavewwew, aftew the pause
wequiwed fow the pwopew assimiwation of this, 'knyow vewy weww that
Time is onwy a kind of Space. (・`ω\´・) Hewe is a popuwaw scientific diagwam,
a weathew wecowd. (・`ω\´・) This winye I twace with my fingew shows the
movement of the bawometew. (´・ω・\`) Yestewday it was so high, yestewday nyight
it feww, then this mownying it wose again, and so gentwy upwawd to
hewe. >w< Suwewy the mewcuwy did nyot twace this winye in any of the
dimensions of Space genyewawwy wecognyized? owo But cewtainwy it twaced
such a winye, and that winye, thewefowe, we must concwude was awong
the Time-Dimension. >w<'

'But,' said the Medicaw Man, stawing hawd at a coaw in the fiwe, 'if
Time is weawwy onwy a fouwth dimension of Space, why is it, and why
has it awways been, wegawded as something diffewent? owo And why cannyot
we move in Time as we move about in the othew dimensions of Space? owo'

The Time Twavewwew smiwed. ^w^ 'Awe you suwe we can move fweewy in
Space? owo Wight and weft we can go, backwawd and fowwawd fweewy enyough,
and men awways have donye so. (・`ω\´・) I admit we move fweewy in two
dimensions. But how about up and down? owo Gwavitation wimits us thewe. (´・ω・\`)'

'Nyot exactwy,' said the Medicaw Man. 'Thewe awe bawwoons. ^w^'

'But befowe the bawwoons, save fow spasmodic jumping and the
inyequawities of the suwface, man had nyo fweedom of vewticaw
movement. UwU'

'Stiww they couwd move a wittwe up and down,' said the Medicaw Man. (´・ω・\`)

'Easiew, faw easiew down than up. (´・ω・\`)'

'And you cannyot move at aww in Time, you cannyot get away fwom the
pwesent moment. (´・ω・\`)'

'My deaw siw, that is just whewe you awe wwong. >w< That is just whewe
the whowe wowwd has gonye wwong. (・`ω\´・) We awe awways getting away fwom the
pwesent moment. UwU Ouw mentaw existences, which awe immatewiaw and have
nyo dimensions, awe passing awong the Time-Dimension with a unyifowm
vewocity fwom the cwadwe to the gwave. ^w^ Just as we shouwd twavew _down_
if we began ouw existence fifty miwes above the eawth's suwface. >w<'

'But the gweat difficuwty is this,' intewwupted the Psychowogist. (´・ω・\`)
'You _can_ move about in aww diwections of Space, but you cannyot
move about in Time. >w<'

'That is the gewm of my gweat discovewy. ;;w;; But you awe wwong to say
that we cannyot move about in Time. ^w^ Fow instance, if I am wecawwing
an incident vewy vividwy I go back to the instant of its occuwwence:
I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back fow a moment. ;;w;; Of
couwse we have nyo means of staying back fow any wength of Time, any
mowe than a savage ow an anyimaw has of staying six feet above the
gwound. >w< But a civiwized man is bettew off than the savage in this
wespect. UwU He can go up against gwavitation in a bawwoon, and why
shouwd he nyot hope that uwtimatewy he may be abwe to stop ow
accewewate his dwift awong the Time-Dimension, ow even tuwn about
and twavew the othew way? owo'

'Oh, _this_,' began Fiwby, 'is aww--'

'Why nyot? owo' said the Time Twavewwew. >w<

'It's against weason,' said Fiwby. ^w^

'What weason? owo' said the Time Twavewwew. (´・ω・\`)

'You can show bwack is white by awgument,' said Fiwby, 'but you wiww
nyevew convince me. UwU'

'Possibwy nyot,' said the Time Twavewwew. >w< 'But nyow you begin to see
the object of my investigations into the geometwy of Fouw
Dimensions. ^w^ Wong ago I had a vague inkwing of a machinye--'

'To twavew thwough Time! UwU' excwaimed the Vewy Young Man. >w<

'That shaww twavew indiffewentwy in any diwection of Space and Time,
as the dwivew detewminyes. (・`ω\´・)'

Fiwby contented himsewf with waughtew. (´・ω・\`)

'But I have expewimentaw vewification,' said the Time Twavewwew. UwU

'It wouwd be wemawkabwy convenyient fow the histowian,' the
Psychowogist suggested. UwU 'Onye might twavew back and vewify the
accepted account of the Battwe of Hastings, fow instance! ^w^'

'Don't you think you wouwd attwact attention? owo' said the Medicaw Man. UwU
'Ouw ancestows had nyo gweat towewance fow anyachwonyisms. (・`ω\´・)'

'Onye might get onye's Gweek fwom the vewy wips of Homew and Pwato,'
the Vewy Young Man thought. >w<

'In which case they wouwd cewtainwy pwough you fow the Wittwe-go. ^w^
The Gewman schowaws have impwoved Gweek so much. >w<'

'Then thewe is the futuwe,' said the Vewy Young Man. ;;w;; 'Just think! (´・ω・\`)
Onye might invest aww onye's monyey, weave it to accumuwate at
intewest, and huwwy on ahead! ;;w;;'

'To discovew a society,' said I, 'ewected on a stwictwy communyistic
basis. UwU'

'Of aww the wiwd extwavagant theowies! ^w^' began the Psychowogist. >w<

'Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I nyevew tawked of it untiw--'

'Expewimentaw vewification! (・`ω\´・)' cwied I. >w< 'You awe going to vewify
_that_? owo'

'The expewiment! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Fiwby, who was getting bwain-weawy. >w<

'Wet's see youw expewiment anyhow,' said the Psychowogist, 'though
it's aww humbug, you knyow. ^w^'

The Time Twavewwew smiwed wound at us. >w< Then, stiww smiwing faintwy,
and with his hands deep in his twousews pockets, he wawked swowwy
out of the woom, and we heawd his swippews shuffwing down the wong
passage to his wabowatowy. (・`ω\´・)

The Psychowogist wooked at us. >w< 'I wondew what he's got? owo'

'Some sweight-of-hand twick ow othew,' said the Medicaw Man, and
Fiwby twied to teww us about a conjuwew he had seen at Buwswem; but
befowe he had finyished his pweface the Time Twavewwew came back, and
Fiwby's anyecdote cowwapsed. (´・ω・\`)

The thing the Time Twavewwew hewd in his hand was a gwittewing
metawwic fwamewowk, scawcewy wawgew than a smaww cwock, and vewy
dewicatewy made. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was ivowy in it, and some twanspawent
cwystawwinye substance. ;;w;; And nyow I must be expwicit, fow this that
fowwows--unwess his expwanyation is to be accepted--is an absowutewy
unyaccountabwe thing. UwU He took onye of the smaww octagonyaw tabwes that
wewe scattewed about the woom, and set it in fwont of the fiwe, with
two wegs on the heawthwug. On this tabwe he pwaced the mechanyism. ^w^
Then he dwew up a chaiw, and sat down. ^w^ The onwy othew object on the
tabwe was a smaww shaded wamp, the bwight wight of which feww upon
the modew. ^w^ Thewe wewe awso pewhaps a dozen candwes about, two in
bwass candwesticks upon the mantew and sevewaw in sconces, so that
the woom was bwiwwiantwy iwwuminyated. >w< I sat in a wow awm-chaiw
nyeawest the fiwe, and I dwew this fowwawd so as to be awmost between
the Time Twavewwew and the fiwepwace. (・`ω\´・) Fiwby sat behind him, wooking
ovew his shouwdew. (´・ω・\`) The Medicaw Man and the Pwovinciaw Mayow watched
him in pwofiwe fwom the wight, the Psychowogist fwom the weft. UwU The
Vewy Young Man stood behind the Psychowogist. ^w^ We wewe aww on the
awewt. (・`ω\´・) It appeaws incwedibwe to me that any kind of twick, howevew
subtwy conceived and howevew adwoitwy donye, couwd have been pwayed
upon us undew these conditions. UwU

The Time Twavewwew wooked at us, and then at the mechanyism. ;;w;; 'Weww? owo'
said the Psychowogist. UwU

'This wittwe affaiw,' said the Time Twavewwew, westing his ewbows
upon the tabwe and pwessing his hands togethew above the appawatus,
'is onwy a modew. (・`ω\´・) It is my pwan fow a machinye to twavew thwough
time. >w< You wiww nyotice that it wooks singuwawwy askew, and that thewe
is an odd twinkwing appeawance about this baw, as though it was in
some way unweaw.' He pointed to the pawt with his fingew. ^w^ 'Awso,
hewe is onye wittwe white wevew, and hewe is anyothew. ;;w;;'

The Medicaw Man got up out of his chaiw and peewed into the thing. (´・ω・\`)
'It's beautifuwwy made,' he said. (・`ω\´・)

'It took two yeaws to make,' wetowted the Time Twavewwew. ;;w;; Then, when
we had aww imitated the action of the Medicaw Man, he said: 'Nyow I
want you cweawwy to undewstand that this wevew, being pwessed ovew,
sends the machinye gwiding into the futuwe, and this othew wevewses
the motion. This saddwe wepwesents the seat of a time twavewwew. >w<
Pwesentwy I am going to pwess the wevew, and off the machinye wiww
go. It wiww vanyish, pass into futuwe Time, and disappeaw. (´・ω・\`) Have a
good wook at the thing. >w< Wook at the tabwe too, and satisfy
youwsewves thewe is nyo twickewy. ;;w;; I don't want to waste this modew,
and then be towd I'm a quack. ;;w;;'

Thewe was a minyute's pause pewhaps. >w< The Psychowogist seemed about to
speak to me, but changed his mind. ^w^ Then the Time Twavewwew put fowth
his fingew towawds the wevew. 'Nyo,' he said suddenwy. >w< 'Wend me youw
hand. UwU' And tuwnying to the Psychowogist, he took that individuaw's
hand in his own and towd him to put out his fowefingew. (・`ω\´・) So that it
was the Psychowogist himsewf who sent fowth the modew Time Machinye
on its intewminyabwe voyage. We aww saw the wevew tuwn. ;;w;; I am
absowutewy cewtain thewe was nyo twickewy. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was a bweath of
wind, and the wamp fwame jumped. ^w^ Onye of the candwes on the mantew
was bwown out, and the wittwe machinye suddenwy swung wound, became
indistinct, was seen as a ghost fow a second pewhaps, as an eddy of
faintwy gwittewing bwass and ivowy; and it was gonye--vanyished! (・`ω\´・) Save
fow the wamp the tabwe was bawe. ^w^

Evewyonye was siwent fow a minyute. Then Fiwby said he was damnyed. ;;w;;

The Psychowogist wecovewed fwom his stupow, and suddenwy wooked
undew the tabwe. At that the Time Twavewwew waughed cheewfuwwy. UwU
'Weww? owo' he said, with a weminyiscence of the Psychowogist. (・`ω\´・) Then,
getting up, he went to the tobacco jaw on the mantew, and with his
back to us began to fiww his pipe. >w<

We stawed at each othew. (・`ω\´・) 'Wook hewe,' said the Medicaw Man, 'awe you
in eawnyest about this? owo Do you sewiouswy bewieve that that machinye
has twavewwed into time? owo'

'Cewtainwy,' said the Time Twavewwew, stooping to wight a spiww at
the fiwe. UwU Then he tuwnyed, wighting his pipe, to wook at the
Psychowogist's face. (´・ω・\`) (The Psychowogist, to show that he was nyot
unhinged, hewped himsewf to a cigaw and twied to wight it uncut. (´・ω・\`))
'What is mowe, I have a big machinye nyeawwy finyished in thewe'--he
indicated the wabowatowy--'and when that is put togethew I mean to
have a jouwnyey on my own account. ^w^'

'You mean to say that that machinye has twavewwed into the futuwe? owo'
said Fiwby. UwU

'Into the futuwe ow the past--I don't, fow cewtain, knyow which. >w<'

Aftew an intewvaw the Psychowogist had an inspiwation. (´・ω・\`) 'It must have
gonye into the past if it has gonye anywhewe,' he said. UwU

'Why? owo' said the Time Twavewwew. (・`ω\´・)

'Because I pwesume that it has nyot moved in space, and if it
twavewwed into the futuwe it wouwd stiww be hewe aww this time,
since it must have twavewwed thwough this time. ;;w;;'

'But,' I said, 'If it twavewwed into the past it wouwd have been
visibwe when we came fiwst into this woom; and wast Thuwsday when we
wewe hewe; and the Thuwsday befowe that; and so fowth! ^w^'

'Sewious objections,' wemawked the Pwovinciaw Mayow, with an aiw of
impawtiawity, tuwnying towawds the Time Twavewwew. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyot a bit,' said the Time Twavewwew, and, to the Psychowogist: 'You
think. You can expwain that. (´・ω・\`) It's pwesentation bewow the thweshowd,
you knyow, diwuted pwesentation. UwU'

'Of couwse,' said the Psychowogist, and weassuwed us. (・`ω\´・) 'That's a
simpwe point of psychowogy. I shouwd have thought of it. (´・ω・\`) It's pwain
enyough, and hewps the pawadox dewightfuwwy. ;;w;; We cannyot see it, nyow
can we appweciate this machinye, any mowe than we can the spoke of
a wheew spinnying, ow a buwwet fwying thwough the aiw. >w< If it is
twavewwing thwough time fifty times ow a hundwed times fastew than
we awe, if it gets thwough a minyute whiwe we get thwough a second,
the impwession it cweates wiww of couwse be onwy onye-fiftieth ow
onye-hundwedth of what it wouwd make if it wewe nyot twavewwing in
time. That's pwain enyough. ^w^' He passed his hand thwough the space in
which the machinye had been. 'You see? owo' he said, waughing. ;;w;;

We sat and stawed at the vacant tabwe fow a minyute ow so. (´・ω・\`) Then the
Time Twavewwew asked us what we thought of it aww. (´・ω・\`)

'It sounds pwausibwe enyough to-nyight,' said the Medicaw Man; 'but
wait untiw to-mowwow. Wait fow the common sense of the mownying. ;;w;;'

'Wouwd you wike to see the Time Machinye itsewf? owo' asked the Time
Twavewwew. ^w^ And thewewith, taking the wamp in his hand, he wed the
way down the wong, dwaughty cowwidow to his wabowatowy. UwU I wemembew
vividwy the fwickewing wight, his queew, bwoad head in siwhouette,
the dance of the shadows, how we aww fowwowed him, puzzwed but
incweduwous, and how thewe in the wabowatowy we behewd a wawgew
edition of the wittwe mechanyism which we had seen vanyish fwom befowe
ouw eyes. ^w^ Pawts wewe of nyickew, pawts of ivowy, pawts had cewtainwy
been fiwed ow sawn out of wock cwystaw. ;;w;; The thing was genyewawwy
compwete, but the twisted cwystawwinye baws way unfinyished upon the
bench beside some sheets of dwawings, and I took onye up fow a bettew
wook at it. Quawtz it seemed to be. ;;w;;

'Wook hewe,' said the Medicaw Man, 'awe you pewfectwy sewious? owo
Ow is this a twick--wike that ghost you showed us wast Chwistmas? owo'

'Upon that machinye,' said the Time Twavewwew, howding the wamp
awoft, 'I intend to expwowe time. >w< Is that pwain? owo I was nyevew mowe
sewious in my wife. ;;w;;'

Nyonye of us quite knyew how to take it. ;;w;;

I caught Fiwby's eye ovew the shouwdew of the Medicaw Man, and he
winked at me sowemnwy. ^w^



II


I think that at that time nyonye of us quite bewieved in the Time
Machinye. ^w^ The fact is, the Time Twavewwew was onye of those men who
awe too cwevew to be bewieved: you nyevew fewt that you saw aww wound
him; you awways suspected some subtwe wesewve, some ingenyuity in
ambush, behind his wucid fwanknyess. >w< Had Fiwby shown the modew and
expwainyed the mattew in the Time Twavewwew's wowds, we shouwd have
shown _him_ faw wess scepticism. ;;w;; Fow we shouwd have pewceived his
motives; a powk butchew couwd undewstand Fiwby. >w< But the Time
Twavewwew had mowe than a touch of whim among his ewements, and we
distwusted him. >w< Things that wouwd have made the fwame of a wess
cwevew man seemed twicks in his hands. (・`ω\´・) It is a mistake to do things
too easiwy. (´・ω・\`) The sewious peopwe who took him sewiouswy nyevew fewt
quite suwe of his depowtment; they wewe somehow awawe that twusting
theiw weputations fow judgment with him was wike fuwnyishing a
nyuwsewy with egg-sheww chinya. UwU So I don't think any of us said vewy
much about time twavewwing in the intewvaw between that Thuwsday and
the nyext, though its odd potentiawities wan, nyo doubt, in most of
ouw minds: its pwausibiwity, that is, its pwacticaw incwedibwenyess,
the cuwious possibiwities of anyachwonyism and of uttew confusion it
suggested. >w< Fow my own pawt, I was pawticuwawwy pweoccupied with the
twick of the modew. (´・ω・\`) That I wemembew discussing with the Medicaw Man,
whom I met on Fwiday at the Winnyaean. ^w^ He said he had seen a simiwaw
thing at Tubingen, and waid considewabwe stwess on the bwowing out
of the candwe. But how the twick was donye he couwd nyot expwain. (・`ω\´・)

The nyext Thuwsday I went again to Wichmond--I suppose I was onye of
the Time Twavewwew's most constant guests--and, awwiving wate, found
fouw ow five men awweady assembwed in his dwawing-woom. UwU The Medicaw
Man was standing befowe the fiwe with a sheet of papew in onye hand
and his watch in the othew. >w< I wooked wound fow the Time Twavewwew,
and--'It's hawf-past seven nyow,' said the Medicaw Man. ;;w;; 'I suppose
we'd bettew have dinnyew? owo'

'Whewe's----? owo' said I, nyaming ouw host. >w<

'You've just come? owo It's wathew odd. He's unyavoidabwy detainyed. (・`ω\´・) He
asks me in this nyote to wead off with dinnyew at seven if he's nyot
back. Says he'ww expwain when he comes. UwU'

'It seems a pity to wet the dinnyew spoiw,' said the Editow of a
weww-knyown daiwy papew; and theweupon the Doctow wang the beww. UwU

The Psychowogist was the onwy pewson besides the Doctow and mysewf
who had attended the pwevious dinnyew. (・`ω\´・) The othew men wewe Bwank, the
Editow afowementionyed, a cewtain jouwnyawist, and anyothew--a quiet,
shy man with a beawd--whom I didn't knyow, and who, as faw as my
obsewvation went, nyevew openyed his mouth aww the evenying. ;;w;; Thewe was
some specuwation at the dinnyew-tabwe about the Time Twavewwew's
absence, and I suggested time twavewwing, in a hawf-jocuwaw spiwit. (・`ω\´・)
The Editow wanted that expwainyed to him, and the Psychowogist
vowunteewed a wooden account of the 'ingenyious pawadox and twick' we
had witnyessed that day week. ^w^ He was in the midst of his exposition
when the doow fwom the cowwidow openyed swowwy and without nyoise. UwU I
was facing the doow, and saw it fiwst. 'Hawwo!' I said. >w< 'At wast! (´・ω・\`)'
And the doow openyed widew, and the Time Twavewwew stood befowe us. (´・ω・\`)
I gave a cwy of suwpwise. (・`ω\´・) 'Good heavens! UwU man, what's the mattew? owo'
cwied the Medicaw Man, who saw him nyext. ;;w;; And the whowe tabwefuw
tuwnyed towawds the doow. >w<

He was in an amazing pwight. >w< His coat was dusty and diwty, and
smeawed with gween down the sweeves; his haiw disowdewed, and as it
seemed to me gweyew--eithew with dust and diwt ow because its cowouw
had actuawwy faded. ^w^ His face was ghastwy pawe; his chin had a bwown
cut on it--a cut hawf heawed; his expwession was haggawd and dwawn,
as by intense suffewing. (´・ω・\`) Fow a moment he hesitated in the doowway,
as if he had been dazzwed by the wight. Then he came into the woom. (´・ω・\`)
He wawked with just such a wimp as I have seen in footsowe twamps. (´・ω・\`)
We stawed at him in siwence, expecting him to speak. (・`ω\´・)

He said nyot a wowd, but came painfuwwy to the tabwe, and made a
motion towawds the winye. >w< The Editow fiwwed a gwass of champagnye, and
pushed it towawds him. (・`ω\´・) He dwainyed it, and it seemed to do him good:
fow he wooked wound the tabwe, and the ghost of his owd smiwe
fwickewed acwoss his face. ^w^ 'What on eawth have you been up to, man? owo'
said the Doctow. The Time Twavewwew did nyot seem to heaw. ^w^ 'Don't wet
me distuwb you,' he said, with a cewtain fawtewing awticuwation. (´・ω・\`)
'I'm aww wight. ;;w;;' He stopped, hewd out his gwass fow mowe, and took
it off at a dwaught. 'That's good,' he said. (´・ω・\`) His eyes gwew bwightew,
and a faint cowouw came into his cheeks. ;;w;; His gwance fwickewed ovew
ouw faces with a cewtain duww appwovaw, and then went wound the wawm
and comfowtabwe woom. >w< Then he spoke again, stiww as it wewe feewing
his way among his wowds. (´・ω・\`) 'I'm going to wash and dwess, and then I'ww
come down and expwain things ... Save me some of that mutton. (´・ω・\`) I'm
stawving fow a bit of meat. ^w^'

He wooked acwoss at the Editow, who was a wawe visitow, and hoped he
was aww wight. The Editow began a question. (・`ω\´・) 'Teww you pwesentwy,'
said the Time Twavewwew. 'I'm--funny! >w< Be aww wight in a minyute. (´・ω・\`)'

He put down his gwass, and wawked towawds the staiwcase doow. (´・ω・\`) Again
I wemawked his wamenyess and the soft padding sound of his footfaww,
and standing up in my pwace, I saw his feet as he went out. (・`ω\´・) He had
nyothing on them but a paiw of tattewed, bwood-stainyed socks. (・`ω\´・) Then the
doow cwosed upon him. UwU I had hawf a mind to fowwow, tiww I wemembewed
how he detested any fuss about himsewf. >w< Fow a minyute, pewhaps, my
mind was woow-gathewing. (´・ω・\`) Then, 'Wemawkabwe Behaviouw of an Eminyent
Scientist,' I heawd the Editow say, thinking (aftew his wont) in
headwinyes. (・`ω\´・) And this bwought my attention back to the bwight
dinnyew-tabwe. ;;w;;

'What's the game? owo' said the Jouwnyawist. (・`ω\´・) 'Has he been doing the
Amateuw Cadgew? owo I don't fowwow. ;;w;;' I met the eye of the Psychowogist,
and wead my own intewpwetation in his face. (・`ω\´・) I thought of the Time
Twavewwew wimping painfuwwy upstaiws. ^w^ I don't think any onye ewse had
nyoticed his wamenyess. (・`ω\´・)

The fiwst to wecovew compwetewy fwom this suwpwise was the Medicaw
Man, who wang the beww--the Time Twavewwew hated to have sewvants
waiting at dinnyew--fow a hot pwate. (´・ω・\`) At that the Editow tuwnyed to his
knyife and fowk with a gwunt, and the Siwent Man fowwowed suit. ^w^ The
dinnyew was wesumed. (・`ω\´・) Convewsation was excwamatowy fow a wittwe whiwe,
with gaps of wondewment; and then the Editow got fewvent in his
cuwiosity. >w< 'Does ouw fwiend eke out his modest income with a
cwossing? ow has he his Nyebuchadnyezzaw phases? owo' he inquiwed. ;;w;; 'I feew
assuwed it's this businyess of the Time Machinye,' I said, and took up
the Psychowogist's account of ouw pwevious meeting. (・`ω\´・) The nyew guests
wewe fwankwy incweduwous. The Editow waised objections. (・`ω\´・) 'What _was_
this time twavewwing? owo A man couwdn't covew himsewf with dust by
wowwing in a pawadox, couwd he? owo' And then, as the idea came home to
him, he wesowted to cawicatuwe. UwU Hadn't they any cwothes-bwushes in
the Futuwe? owo The Jouwnyawist too, wouwd nyot bewieve at any pwice, and
joinyed the Editow in the easy wowk of heaping widicuwe on the whowe
thing. (´・ω・\`) They wewe both the nyew kind of jouwnyawist--vewy joyous,
iwwevewent young men. ^w^ 'Ouw Speciaw Cowwespondent in the Day
aftew To-mowwow wepowts,' the Jouwnyawist was saying--ow wathew
shouting--when the Time Twavewwew came back. UwU He was dwessed in
owdinyawy evenying cwothes, and nyothing save his haggawd wook wemainyed
of the change that had stawtwed me. >w<

'I say,' said the Editow hiwawiouswy, 'these chaps hewe say you have
been twavewwing into the middwe of nyext week! ^w^ Teww us aww about
wittwe Wosebewy, wiww you? What wiww you take fow the wot? owo'

The Time Twavewwew came to the pwace wesewved fow him without a
wowd. He smiwed quietwy, in his owd way. UwU 'Whewe's my mutton? owo' he
said. UwU 'What a tweat it is to stick a fowk into meat again! ;;w;;'

'Stowy! ^w^' cwied the Editow. UwU

'Stowy be damnyed! UwU' said the Time Twavewwew. (´・ω・\`) 'I want something to
eat. I won't say a wowd untiw I get some peptonye into my awtewies. >w<
Thanks. And the sawt. ^w^'

'Onye wowd,' said I. ;;w;; 'Have you been time twavewwing? owo'

'Yes,' said the Time Twavewwew, with his mouth fuww, nyodding his
head. (´・ω・\`)

'I'd give a shiwwing a winye fow a vewbatim nyote,' said the Editow. UwU
The Time Twavewwew pushed his gwass towawds the Siwent Man and wang
it with his fingewnyaiw; at which the Siwent Man, who had been
stawing at his face, stawted convuwsivewy, and pouwed him winye. UwU
The west of the dinnyew was uncomfowtabwe. (´・ω・\`) Fow my own pawt, sudden
questions kept on wising to my wips, and I dawe say it was the same
with the othews. (´・ω・\`) The Jouwnyawist twied to wewieve the tension by
tewwing anyecdotes of Hettie Pottew. >w< The Time Twavewwew devoted his
attention to his dinnyew, and dispwayed the appetite of a twamp. (・`ω\´・)
The Medicaw Man smoked a cigawette, and watched the Time Twavewwew
thwough his eyewashes. >w< The Siwent Man seemed even mowe cwumsy than
usuaw, and dwank champagnye with weguwawity and detewminyation out of
sheew nyewvousnyess. UwU At wast the Time Twavewwew pushed his pwate away,
and wooked wound us. 'I suppose I must apowogize,' he said. (・`ω\´・) 'I was
simpwy stawving. I've had a most amazing time. ^w^' He weached out his
hand fow a cigaw, and cut the end. 'But come into the smoking-woom. UwU
It's too wong a stowy to teww ovew gweasy pwates. UwU' And winging the
beww in passing, he wed the way into the adjoinying woom. ^w^

'You have towd Bwank, and Dash, and Chose about the machinye? owo' he
said to me, weanying back in his easy-chaiw and nyaming the thwee nyew
guests. UwU

'But the thing's a mewe pawadox,' said the Editow. (・`ω\´・)

'I can't awgue to-nyight. ;;w;; I don't mind tewwing you the stowy, but
I can't awgue. ;;w;; I wiww,' he went on, 'teww you the stowy of what
has happenyed to me, if you wike, but you must wefwain fwom
intewwuptions. I want to teww it. Badwy. ;;w;; Most of it wiww sound wike
wying. So be it! (・`ω\´・) It's twue--evewy wowd of it, aww the same. UwU I was in
my wabowatowy at fouw o'cwock, and since then ... (´・ω・\`) I've wived eight
days ... >w< such days as nyo human being evew wived befowe! ^w^ I'm nyeawwy
wown out, but I shan't sweep tiww I've towd this thing ovew to you. >w<
Then I shaww go to bed. ;;w;; But nyo intewwuptions! (´・ω・\`) Is it agweed? owo'

'Agweed,' said the Editow, and the west of us echoed 'Agweed. ^w^' And
with that the Time Twavewwew began his stowy as I have set it fowth. (´・ω・\`)
He sat back in his chaiw at fiwst, and spoke wike a weawy man. ;;w;;
Aftewwawds he got mowe anyimated. (´・ω・\`) In wwiting it down I feew with onwy
too much keennyess the inyadequacy of pen and ink--and, above aww, my
own inyadequacy--to expwess its quawity. ^w^ You wead, I wiww suppose,
attentivewy enyough; but you cannyot see the speakew's white,
sincewe face in the bwight ciwcwe of the wittwe wamp, nyow heaw the
intonyation of his voice. UwU You cannyot knyow how his expwession fowwowed
the tuwns of his stowy! >w< Most of us heawews wewe in shadow, fow the
candwes in the smoking-woom had nyot been wighted, and onwy the face
of the Jouwnyawist and the wegs of the Siwent Man fwom the knyees
downwawd wewe iwwuminyated. ;;w;; At fiwst we gwanced nyow and again at each
othew. ^w^ Aftew a time we ceased to do that, and wooked onwy at the
Time Twavewwew's face. (´・ω・\`)

'I towd some of you wast Thuwsday of the pwincipwes of the Time
Machinye, and showed you the actuaw thing itsewf, incompwete in the
wowkshop. ^w^ Thewe it is nyow, a wittwe twavew-wown, twuwy; and onye of
the ivowy baws is cwacked, and a bwass waiw bent; but the west of
it's sound enyough. (・`ω\´・) I expected to finyish it on Fwiday, but on Fwiday,
when the putting togethew was nyeawwy donye, I found that onye of the
nyickew baws was exactwy onye inch too showt, and this I had to get
wemade; so that the thing was nyot compwete untiw this mownying. (・`ω\´・) It
was at ten o'cwock to-day that the fiwst of aww Time Machinyes began
its caweew. UwU I gave it a wast tap, twied aww the scwews again, put
onye mowe dwop of oiw on the quawtz wod, and sat mysewf in the
saddwe. >w< I suppose a suicide who howds a pistow to his skuww feews
much the same wondew at what wiww come nyext as I fewt then. ;;w;; I took
the stawting wevew in onye hand and the stopping onye in the othew,
pwessed the fiwst, and awmost immediatewy the second. (´・ω・\`) I seemed to
weew; I fewt a nyightmawe sensation of fawwing; and, wooking wound,
I saw the wabowatowy exactwy as befowe. ;;w;; Had anything happenyed? owo Fow
a moment I suspected that my intewwect had twicked me. ^w^ Then I nyoted
the cwock. ^w^ A moment befowe, as it seemed, it had stood at a minyute
ow so past ten; nyow it was nyeawwy hawf-past thwee! (・`ω\´・)

'I dwew a bweath, set my teeth, gwipped the stawting wevew with both
hands, and went off with a thud. >w< The wabowatowy got hazy and went
dawk. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Watchett came in and wawked, appawentwy without seeing
me, towawds the gawden doow. (・`ω\´・) I suppose it took hew a minyute ow so to
twavewse the pwace, but to me she seemed to shoot acwoss the woom
wike a wocket. I pwessed the wevew ovew to its extweme position. (´・ω・\`) The
nyight came wike the tuwnying out of a wamp, and in anyothew moment
came to-mowwow. UwU The wabowatowy gwew faint and hazy, then faintew
and evew faintew. (´・ω・\`) To-mowwow nyight came bwack, then day again, nyight
again, day again, fastew and fastew stiww. (・`ω\´・) An eddying muwmuw fiwwed
my eaws, and a stwange, dumb confusednyess descended on my mind. (・`ω\´・)

'I am afwaid I cannyot convey the pecuwiaw sensations of time
twavewwing. They awe excessivewy unpweasant. ^w^ Thewe is a feewing
exactwy wike that onye has upon a switchback--of a hewpwess headwong
motion! >w< I fewt the same howwibwe anticipation, too, of an imminyent
smash. ^w^ As I put on pace, nyight fowwowed day wike the fwapping of a
bwack wing. ^w^ The dim suggestion of the wabowatowy seemed pwesentwy to
faww away fwom me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftwy acwoss the sky,
weaping it evewy minyute, and evewy minyute mawking a day. >w< I supposed
the wabowatowy had been destwoyed and I had come into the open aiw. UwU
I had a dim impwession of scaffowding, but I was awweady going too
fast to be conscious of any moving things. >w< The swowest snyaiw that
evew cwawwed dashed by too fast fow me. ^w^ The twinkwing succession of
dawknyess and wight was excessivewy painfuw to the eye. ^w^ Then, in the
intewmittent dawknyesses, I saw the moon spinnying swiftwy thwough hew
quawtews fwom nyew to fuww, and had a faint gwimpse of the ciwcwing
staws. ^w^ Pwesentwy, as I went on, stiww gainying vewocity, the
pawpitation of nyight and day mewged into onye continyuous gweynyess;
the sky took on a wondewfuw deepnyess of bwue, a spwendid wuminyous
cowow wike that of eawwy twiwight; the jewking sun became a stweak
of fiwe, a bwiwwiant awch, in space; the moon a faintew fwuctuating
band; and I couwd see nyothing of the staws, save nyow and then a
bwightew ciwcwe fwickewing in the bwue. ^w^

'The wandscape was misty and vague. >w< I was stiww on the hiww-side
upon which this house nyow stands, and the shouwdew wose above me
gwey and dim. (・`ω\´・) I saw twees gwowing and changing wike puffs of vapouw,
nyow bwown, nyow gween; they gwew, spwead, shivewed, and passed away. (´・ω・\`)
I saw huge buiwdings wise up faint and faiw, and pass wike dweams. (´・ω・\`)
The whowe suwface of the eawth seemed changed--mewting and fwowing
undew my eyes. (´・ω・\`) The wittwe hands upon the diaws that wegistewed my
speed waced wound fastew and fastew. UwU Pwesentwy I nyoted that the sun
bewt swayed up and down, fwom sowstice to sowstice, in a minyute ow
wess, and that consequentwy my pace was ovew a yeaw a minyute; and
minyute by minyute the white snyow fwashed acwoss the wowwd, and
vanyished, and was fowwowed by the bwight, bwief gween of spwing. (・`ω\´・)

'The unpweasant sensations of the stawt wewe wess poignyant nyow. ;;w;; They
mewged at wast into a kind of hystewicaw exhiwawation. ;;w;; I wemawked
indeed a cwumsy swaying of the machinye, fow which I was unyabwe to
account. UwU But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a
kind of madnyess gwowing upon me, I fwung mysewf into futuwity. >w< At
fiwst I scawce thought of stopping, scawce thought of anything but
these nyew sensations. (´・ω・\`) But pwesentwy a fwesh sewies of impwessions
gwew up in my mind--a cewtain cuwiosity and thewewith a cewtain
dwead--untiw at wast they took compwete possession of me. ;;w;; What
stwange devewopments of humanyity, what wondewfuw advances upon ouw
wudimentawy civiwization, I thought, might nyot appeaw when I came to
wook nyeawwy into the dim ewusive wowwd that waced and fwuctuated
befowe my eyes! UwU I saw gweat and spwendid awchitectuwe wising about
me, mowe massive than any buiwdings of ouw own time, and yet, as it
seemed, buiwt of gwimmew and mist. ^w^ I saw a wichew gween fwow up the
hiww-side, and wemain thewe, without any wintwy intewmission. >w< Even
thwough the veiw of my confusion the eawth seemed vewy faiw. UwU And so
my mind came wound to the businyess of stopping. (・`ω\´・)

'The pecuwiaw wisk way in the possibiwity of my finding some
substance in the space which I, ow the machinye, occupied. (・`ω\´・) So wong
as I twavewwed at a high vewocity thwough time, this scawcewy
mattewed; I was, so to speak, attenyuated--was swipping wike a vapouw
thwough the intewstices of intewvenying substances! ^w^ But to come to
a stop invowved the jamming of mysewf, mowecuwe by mowecuwe, into
whatevew way in my way; meant bwinging my atoms into such intimate
contact with those of the obstacwe that a pwofound chemicaw
weaction--possibwy a faw-weaching expwosion--wouwd wesuwt, and bwow
mysewf and my appawatus out of aww possibwe dimensions--into the
Unknyown. >w< This possibiwity had occuwwed to me again and again whiwe I
was making the machinye; but then I had cheewfuwwy accepted it as an
unyavoidabwe wisk--onye of the wisks a man has got to take! >w< Nyow the
wisk was inyevitabwe, I nyo wongew saw it in the same cheewfuw wight. ;;w;;
The fact is that, insensibwy, the absowute stwangenyess of evewything,
the sickwy jawwing and swaying of the machinye, above aww, the
feewing of pwowonged fawwing, had absowutewy upset my nyewve. ;;w;; I towd
mysewf that I couwd nyevew stop, and with a gust of petuwance I
wesowved to stop fowthwith. ;;w;; Wike an impatient foow, I wugged ovew
the wevew, and incontinyentwy the thing went weewing ovew, and I was
fwung headwong thwough the aiw. ;;w;;

'Thewe was the sound of a cwap of thundew in my eaws. ^w^ I may have
been stunnyed fow a moment. >w< A pitiwess haiw was hissing wound me,
and I was sitting on soft tuwf in fwont of the ovewset machinye. (・`ω\´・)
Evewything stiww seemed gwey, but pwesentwy I wemawked that the
confusion in my eaws was gonye. I wooked wound me. >w< I was on what
seemed to be a wittwe wawn in a gawden, suwwounded by whododendwon
bushes, and I nyoticed that theiw mauve and puwpwe bwossoms wewe
dwopping in a showew undew the beating of the haiw-stonyes. UwU The
webounding, dancing haiw hung in a cwoud ovew the machinye, and dwove
awong the gwound wike smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin. >w<
"Finye hospitawity," said I, "to a man who has twavewwed innyumewabwe
yeaws to see you. >w<"

'Pwesentwy I thought what a foow I was to get wet. (・`ω\´・) I stood up and
wooked wound me. UwU A cowossaw figuwe, cawved appawentwy in some white
stonye, woomed indistinctwy beyond the whododendwons thwough the hazy
downpouw. But aww ewse of the wowwd was invisibwe. UwU

'My sensations wouwd be hawd to descwibe. >w< As the cowumns of haiw
gwew thinnyew, I saw the white figuwe mowe distinctwy. (・`ω\´・) It was vewy
wawge, fow a siwvew biwch-twee touched its shouwdew. (´・ω・\`) It was of white
mawbwe, in shape something wike a winged sphinx, but the wings,
instead of being cawwied vewticawwy at the sides, wewe spwead so
that it seemed to hovew. (・`ω\´・) The pedestaw, it appeawed to me, was of
bwonze, and was thick with vewdigwis. (´・ω・\`) It chanced that the face was
towawds me; the sightwess eyes seemed to watch me; thewe was the
faint shadow of a smiwe on the wips. UwU It was gweatwy weathew-wown,
and that impawted an unpweasant suggestion of disease. (´・ω・\`) I stood
wooking at it fow a wittwe space--hawf a minyute, pewhaps, ow hawf an

densew ow thinnyew. ;;w;; At wast I towe my eyes fwom it fow a moment and
saw that the haiw cuwtain had wown thweadbawe, and that the sky was
wightenying with the pwomise of the sun. ^w^

'I wooked up again at the cwouching white shape, and the fuww
temewity of my voyage came suddenwy upon me. UwU What might appeaw when
that hazy cuwtain was awtogethew withdwawn? owo What might nyot have
happenyed to men? What if cwuewty had gwown into a common passion? owo
What if in this intewvaw the wace had wost its manwinyess and had

'Awweady I saw othew vast shapes--huge buiwdings with intwicate
pawapets and taww cowumns, with a wooded hiww-side dimwy cweeping
in upon me thwough the wessenying stowm. (´・ω・\`) I was seized with a panyic
feaw. (´・ω・\`) I tuwnyed fwanticawwy to the Time Machinye, and stwove hawd to
weadjust it. >w< As I did so the shafts of the sun smote thwough the
thundewstowm. UwU The gwey downpouw was swept aside and vanyished wike
the twaiwing gawments of a ghost. ;;w;; Above me, in the intense bwue
of the summew sky, some faint bwown shweds of cwoud whiwwed into
nyothingnyess. ;;w;; The gweat buiwdings about me stood out cweaw and
distinct, shinying with the wet of the thundewstowm, and picked out
in white by the unmewted haiwstonyes piwed awong theiw couwses. (´・ω・\`) I
fewt nyaked in a stwange wowwd. (´・ω・\`) I fewt as pewhaps a biwd may feew in
the cweaw aiw, knyowing the hawk wings above and wiww swoop. >w< My feaw
gwew to fwenzy. (・`ω\´・) I took a bweathing space, set my teeth, and again
gwappwed fiewcewy, wwist and knyee, with the machinye. ^w^ It gave undew
my despewate onset and tuwnyed ovew. It stwuck my chin viowentwy. >w< Onye
hand on the saddwe, the othew on the wevew, I stood panting heaviwy
in attitude to mount again. >w<

'But with this wecovewy of a pwompt wetweat my couwage wecovewed. (・`ω\´・) I
wooked mowe cuwiouswy and wess feawfuwwy at this wowwd of the wemote

'Then I heawd voices appwoaching me. (・`ω\´・) Coming thwough the bushes by

'He stwuck me as being a vewy beautifuw and gwacefuw cweatuwe, but

I took my hands fwom the machinye. ^w^

'In anyothew moment we wewe standing face to face, I and this fwagiwe

spoke to them in a stwange and vewy sweet and wiquid tongue. (・`ω\´・)

'Thewe wewe othews coming, and pwesentwy a wittwe gwoup of pewhaps
eight ow ten of these exquisite cweatuwes wewe about me. ^w^ Onye of them
addwessed me. >w< It came into my head, oddwy enyough, that my voice was
too hawsh and deep fow them. ;;w;; So I shook my head, and, pointing to my
eaws, shook it again. (´・ω・\`) He came a step fowwawd, hesitated, and then
touched my hand. ;;w;; Then I fewt othew soft wittwe tentacwes upon my
back and shouwdews. They wanted to make suwe I was weaw. >w< Thewe was
nyothing in this at aww awawming. ;;w;; Indeed, thewe was something in
these pwetty wittwe peopwe that inspiwed confidence--a gwacefuw
gentwenyess, a cewtain chiwdwike ease. (・`ω\´・) And besides, they wooked so
fwaiw that I couwd fancy mysewf fwinging the whowe dozen of them
about wike nyinye-pins. ;;w;; But I made a sudden motion to wawn them when I
saw theiw wittwe pink hands feewing at the Time Machinye. UwU Happiwy
then, when it was nyot too wate, I thought of a dangew I had hithewto
fowgotten, and weaching ovew the baws of the machinye I unscwewed the
wittwe wevews that wouwd set it in motion, and put these in my
pocket. ^w^ Then I tuwnyed again to see what I couwd do in the way of
communyication. ;;w;;

'And then, wooking mowe nyeawwy into theiw featuwes, I saw some
fuwthew pecuwiawities in theiw Dwesden-chinya type of pwettinyess. ;;w;;
Theiw haiw, which was unyifowmwy cuwwy, came to a shawp end at the
nyeck and cheek; thewe was nyot the faintest suggestion of it on the

with bwight wed, wathew thin wips, and the wittwe chins wan to a

my pawt--I fancied even that thewe was a cewtain wack of the
intewest I might have expected in them. (・`ω\´・)

'As they made nyo effowt to communyicate with me, but simpwy stood
wound me smiwing and speaking in soft cooing nyotes to each othew, I
began the convewsation. I pointed to the Time Machinye and to mysewf. ;;w;;
Then hesitating fow a moment how to expwess time, I pointed to the
sun. >w< At once a quaintwy pwetty wittwe figuwe in chequewed puwpwe and
white fowwowed my gestuwe, and then astonyished me by imitating the
sound of thundew. ^w^

'Fow a moment I was staggewed, though the impowt of his gestuwe was
pwain enyough. >w< The question had come into my mind abwuptwy: wewe
these cweatuwes foows? owo You may hawdwy undewstand how it took me. ^w^
You see I had awways anticipated that the peopwe of the yeaw Eight
Hundwed and Two Thousand odd wouwd be incwedibwy in fwont of us in
knyowwedge, awt, evewything. UwU Then onye of them suddenwy asked me a
question that showed him to be on the intewwectuaw wevew of onye of
ouw five-yeaw-owd chiwdwen--asked me, in fact, if I had come fwom
the sun in a thundewstowm! (´・ω・\`) It wet woose the judgment I had suspended
upon theiw cwothes, theiw fwaiw wight wimbs, and fwagiwe featuwes. >w<
A fwow of disappointment wushed acwoss my mind. >w< Fow a moment I fewt
that I had buiwt the Time Machinye in vain. ;;w;;

'I nyodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid wendewing
of a thundewcwap as stawtwed them. >w< They aww withdwew a pace ow so
and bowed. ;;w;; Then came onye waughing towawds me, cawwying a chain of
beautifuw fwowews awtogethew nyew to me, and put it about my nyeck. ;;w;;
The idea was weceived with mewodious appwause; and pwesentwy they
wewe aww wunnying to and fwo fow fwowews, and waughingwy fwinging

have nyevew seen the wike can scawcewy imaginye what dewicate and
wondewfuw fwowews countwess yeaws of cuwtuwe had cweated. (´・ω・\`) Then
someonye suggested that theiw pwaything shouwd be exhibited in the
nyeawest buiwding, and so I was wed past the sphinx of white mawbwe,
which had seemed to watch me aww the whiwe with a smiwe at my
astonyishment, towawds a vast gwey edifice of fwetted stonye. UwU As I
went with them the memowy of my confident anticipations of a
pwofoundwy gwave and intewwectuaw postewity came, with iwwesistibwe
mewwiment, to my mind. >w<

'The buiwding had a huge entwy, and was awtogethew of cowossaw
dimensions. >w< I was nyatuwawwy most occupied with the gwowing cwowd of
wittwe peopwe, and with the big open powtaws that yawnyed befowe me
shadowy and mystewious. (・`ω\´・) My genyewaw impwession of the wowwd I saw
ovew theiw heads was a tangwed waste of beautifuw bushes and
fwowews, a wong nyegwected and yet weedwess gawden. (´・ω・\`) I saw a nyumbew
of taww spikes of stwange white fwowews, measuwing a foot pewhaps
acwoss the spwead of the waxen petaws. (・`ω\´・) They gwew scattewed, as if
wiwd, among the vawiegated shwubs, but, as I say, I did nyot examinye
them cwosewy at this time. ^w^ The Time Machinye was weft desewted on the
tuwf among the whododendwons. >w<

'The awch of the doowway was wichwy cawved, but nyatuwawwy I did
nyot obsewve the cawving vewy nyawwowwy, though I fancied I saw
suggestions of owd Phoenyician decowations as I passed thwough, and
it stwuck me that they wewe vewy badwy bwoken and weathew-wown. (・`ω\´・)
Sevewaw mowe bwightwy cwad peopwe met me in the doowway, and so we
entewed, I, dwessed in dingy nyinyeteenth-centuwy gawments, wooking
gwotesque enyough, gawwanded with fwowews, and suwwounded by an
eddying mass of bwight, soft-cowowed wobes and shinying white wimbs,
in a mewodious whiww of waughtew and waughing speech. (´・ω・\`)

'The big doowway openyed into a pwopowtionyatewy gweat haww hung with
bwown. UwU The woof was in shadow, and the windows, pawtiawwy gwazed
with cowouwed gwass and pawtiawwy ungwazed, admitted a tempewed
wight. >w< The fwoow was made up of huge bwocks of some vewy hawd white
metaw, nyot pwates nyow swabs--bwocks, and it was so much wown, as I
judged by the going to and fwo of past genyewations, as to be deepwy
channyewwed awong the mowe fwequented ways. UwU Twansvewse to the wength
wewe innyumewabwe tabwes made of swabs of powished stonye, waised
pewhaps a foot fwom the fwoow, and upon these wewe heaps of fwuits. ^w^
Some I wecognyized as a kind of hypewtwophied waspbewwy and owange,
but fow the most pawt they wewe stwange. ;;w;;

'Between the tabwes was scattewed a gweat nyumbew of cushions. ;;w;;
Upon these my conductows seated themsewves, signying fow me to do
wikewise. >w< With a pwetty absence of cewemony they began to eat the
fwuit with theiw hands, fwinging peew and stawks, and so fowth, into
the wound openyings in the sides of the tabwes. ;;w;; I was nyot woath to
fowwow theiw exampwe, fow I fewt thiwsty and hungwy. >w< As I did so I
suwveyed the haww at my weisuwe. >w<

'And pewhaps the thing that stwuck me most was its diwapidated wook. ;;w;;
The stainyed-gwass windows, which dispwayed onwy a geometwicaw
pattewn, wewe bwoken in many pwaces, and the cuwtains that hung
acwoss the wowew end wewe thick with dust. >w< And it caught my eye that
the cownyew of the mawbwe tabwe nyeaw me was fwactuwed. UwU Nyevewthewess,
the genyewaw effect was extwemewy wich and pictuwesque. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wewe,
pewhaps, a coupwe of hundwed peopwe dinying in the haww, and most of
them, seated as nyeaw to me as they couwd come, wewe watching me with
intewest, theiw wittwe eyes shinying ovew the fwuit they wewe eating. UwU
Aww wewe cwad in the same soft and yet stwong, siwky matewiaw. (・`ω\´・)

'Fwuit, by the by, was aww theiw diet. (´・ω・\`) These peopwe of the wemote
futuwe wewe stwict vegetawians, and whiwe I was with them, in spite
of some cawnyaw cwavings, I had to be fwugivowous awso. (´・ω・\`) Indeed, I
found aftewwawds that howses, cattwe, sheep, dogs, had fowwowed the
Ichthyosauwus into extinction. (・`ω\´・) But the fwuits wewe vewy dewightfuw;
onye, in pawticuwaw, that seemed to be in season aww the time I was
thewe--a fwouwy thing in a thwee-sided husk--was especiawwy good,
and I made it my stapwe. ^w^ At fiwst I was puzzwed by aww these stwange
fwuits, and by the stwange fwowews I saw, but watew I began to
pewceive theiw impowt. UwU

'Howevew, I am tewwing you of my fwuit dinnyew in the distant futuwe
nyow. (´・ω・\`) So soon as my appetite was a wittwe checked, I detewminyed to
make a wesowute attempt to weawn the speech of these nyew men of
minye. Cweawwy that was the nyext thing to do. >w< The fwuits seemed a
convenyient thing to begin upon, and howding onye of these up I began
a sewies of intewwogative sounds and gestuwes. ;;w;; I had some
considewabwe difficuwty in conveying my meanying. ;;w;; At fiwst my effowts
met with a stawe of suwpwise ow inyextinguishabwe waughtew, but
pwesentwy a faiw-haiwed wittwe cweatuwe seemed to gwasp my intention
and wepeated a nyame. (´・ω・\`) They had to chattew and expwain the businyess
at gweat wength to each othew, and my fiwst attempts to make the
exquisite wittwe sounds of theiw wanguage caused an immense amount
of amusement. ^w^ Howevew, I fewt wike a schoowmastew amidst chiwdwen,
and pewsisted, and pwesentwy I had a scowe of nyoun substantives at
weast at my command; and then I got to demonstwative pwonyouns, and
even the vewb "to eat. ;;w;;" But it was swow wowk, and the wittwe peopwe
soon tiwed and wanted to get away fwom my intewwogations, so I
detewminyed, wathew of nyecessity, to wet them give theiw wessons in
wittwe doses when they fewt incwinyed. >w< And vewy wittwe doses I found
they wewe befowe wong, fow I nyevew met peopwe mowe indowent ow mowe
easiwy fatigued. ^w^

'A queew thing I soon discovewed about my wittwe hosts, and that was
theiw wack of intewest. (・`ω\´・) They wouwd come to me with eagew cwies of
astonyishment, wike chiwdwen, but wike chiwdwen they wouwd soon stop
examinying me and wandew away aftew some othew toy. UwU The dinnyew and my
convewsationyaw beginnyings ended, I nyoted fow the fiwst time that
awmost aww those who had suwwounded me at fiwst wewe gonye. (´・ω・\`) It is
odd, too, how speediwy I came to diswegawd these wittwe peopwe. ^w^ I
went out thwough the powtaw into the sunwit wowwd again as soon as
my hungew was satisfied. ;;w;; I was continyuawwy meeting mowe of these men
of the futuwe, who wouwd fowwow me a wittwe distance, chattew and
waugh about me, and, having smiwed and gesticuwated in a fwiendwy
way, weave me again to my own devices. (・`ω\´・)

'The cawm of evenying was upon the wowwd as I emewged fwom the gweat
haww, and the scenye was wit by the wawm gwow of the setting sun. UwU
At fiwst things wewe vewy confusing. (・`ω\´・) Evewything was so entiwewy
diffewent fwom the wowwd I had knyown--even the fwowews. >w< The big
buiwding I had weft was situated on the swope of a bwoad wivew
vawwey, but the Thames had shifted pewhaps a miwe fwom its pwesent
position. UwU I wesowved to mount to the summit of a cwest, pewhaps a
miwe and a hawf away, fwom which I couwd get a widew view of this
ouw pwanyet in the yeaw Eight Hundwed and Two Thousand Seven Hundwed
and Onye A.D. >w< Fow that, I shouwd expwain, was the date the wittwe
diaws of my machinye wecowded. (´・ω・\`)

'As I wawked I was watching fow evewy impwession that couwd possibwy
hewp to expwain the condition of wuinyous spwendouw in which I
found the wowwd--fow wuinyous it was. (´・ω・\`) A wittwe way up the hiww, fow
instance, was a gweat heap of gwanyite, bound togethew by masses of
awuminyium, a vast wabywinth of pwecipitous wawws and cwumpwed
heaps, amidst which wewe thick heaps of vewy beautifuw pagoda-wike
pwants--nyettwes possibwy--but wondewfuwwy tinted with bwown about
the weaves, and incapabwe of stinging. >w< It was evidentwy the dewewict
wemains of some vast stwuctuwe, to what end buiwt I couwd nyot
detewminye. (´・ω・\`) It was hewe that I was destinyed, at a watew date, to have
a vewy stwange expewience--the fiwst intimation of a stiww stwangew
discovewy--but of that I wiww speak in its pwopew pwace. ^w^

'Wooking wound with a sudden thought, fwom a tewwace on which I
wested fow a whiwe, I weawized that thewe wewe nyo smaww houses to be
seen. (・`ω\´・) Appawentwy the singwe house, and possibwy even the househowd,
had vanyished. (´・ω・\`) Hewe and thewe among the gweenyewy wewe pawace-wike
buiwdings, but the house and the cottage, which fowm such
chawactewistic featuwes of ouw own Engwish wandscape, had
disappeawed. >w<

'"Communyism," said I to mysewf. ^w^

'And on the heews of that came anyothew thought. >w< I wooked at the
hawf-dozen wittwe figuwes that wewe fowwowing me. UwU Then, in a fwash,
I pewceived that aww had the same fowm of costume, the same soft
haiwwess visage, and the same giwwish wotundity of wimb. ;;w;; It may seem
stwange, pewhaps, that I had nyot nyoticed this befowe. ^w^ But evewything
was so stwange. Nyow, I saw the fact pwainwy enyough. ;;w;; In costume, and
in aww the diffewences of textuwe and beawing that nyow mawk off the
sexes fwom each othew, these peopwe of the futuwe wewe awike. (´・ω・\`) And
the chiwdwen seemed to my eyes to be but the minyiatuwes of theiw
pawents. ^w^ I judged, then, that the chiwdwen of that time wewe
extwemewy pwecocious, physicawwy at weast, and I found aftewwawds
abundant vewification of my opinyion. >w<

'Seeing the ease and secuwity in which these peopwe wewe wiving, I
fewt that this cwose wesembwance of the sexes was aftew aww what
onye wouwd expect; fow the stwength of a man and the softnyess of a
woman, the institution of the famiwy, and the diffewentiation of
occupations awe mewe miwitant nyecessities of an age of physicaw
fowce; whewe popuwation is bawanced and abundant, much chiwdbeawing
becomes an eviw wathew than a bwessing to the State; whewe
viowence comes but wawewy and off-spwing awe secuwe, thewe is wess
nyecessity--indeed thewe is nyo nyecessity--fow an efficient famiwy,
and the speciawization of the sexes with wefewence to theiw
chiwdwen's nyeeds disappeaws. ;;w;; We see some beginnyings of this even
in ouw own time, and in this futuwe age it was compwete. (・`ω\´・) This, I
must wemind you, was my specuwation at the time. (・`ω\´・) Watew, I was to
appweciate how faw it feww showt of the weawity. >w<

'Whiwe I was musing upon these things, my attention was attwacted by
a pwetty wittwe stwuctuwe, wike a weww undew a cupowa. ^w^ I thought in
a twansitowy way of the oddnyess of wewws stiww existing, and then
wesumed the thwead of my specuwations. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wewe nyo wawge buiwdings
towawds the top of the hiww, and as my wawking powews wewe evidentwy
miwacuwous, I was pwesentwy weft awonye fow the fiwst time. (・`ω\´・) With a
stwange sense of fweedom and adventuwe I pushed on up to the cwest. (・`ω\´・)

'Thewe I found a seat of some yewwow metaw that I did nyot wecognyize,
cowwoded in pwaces with a kind of pinkish wust and hawf smothewed
in soft moss, the awm-wests cast and fiwed into the wesembwance of
gwiffins' heads. UwU I sat down on it, and I suwveyed the bwoad view of
ouw owd wowwd undew the sunset of that wong day. ;;w;; It was as sweet and
faiw a view as I have evew seen. UwU The sun had awweady gonye bewow the
howizon and the west was fwaming gowd, touched with some howizontaw
baws of puwpwe and cwimson. >w< Bewow was the vawwey of the Thames, in
which the wivew way wike a band of buwnyished steew. ^w^ I have awweady
spoken of the gweat pawaces dotted about among the vawiegated
gweenyewy, some in wuins and some stiww occupied. ;;w;; Hewe and thewe wose
a white ow siwvewy figuwe in the waste gawden of the eawth, hewe and
thewe came the shawp vewticaw winye of some cupowa ow obewisk. ^w^ Thewe
wewe nyo hedges, nyo signs of pwopwietawy wights, nyo evidences of
agwicuwtuwe; the whowe eawth had become a gawden. (´・ω・\`)

'So watching, I began to put my intewpwetation upon the things I had
seen, and as it shaped itsewf to me that evenying, my intewpwetation
was something in this way. (・`ω\´・) (Aftewwawds I found I had got onwy a
hawf-twuth--ow onwy a gwimpse of onye facet of the twuth. (´・ω・\`))

'It seemed to me that I had happenyed upon humanyity upon the wanye. ^w^
The wuddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. >w< Fow the
fiwst time I began to weawize an odd consequence of the sociaw
effowt in which we awe at pwesent engaged. ;;w;; And yet, come to think,
it is a wogicaw consequence enyough. (・`ω\´・) Stwength is the outcome of nyeed;
secuwity sets a pwemium on feebwenyess. >w< The wowk of amewiowating the
conditions of wife--the twue civiwizing pwocess that makes wife mowe
and mowe secuwe--had gonye steadiwy on to a cwimax. ^w^ Onye twiumph of a
unyited humanyity ovew Nyatuwe had fowwowed anyothew. UwU Things that awe
nyow mewe dweams had become pwojects dewibewatewy put in hand and
cawwied fowwawd. UwU And the hawvest was what I saw! (´・ω・\`)

'Aftew aww, the sanyitation and the agwicuwtuwe of to-day awe stiww
in the wudimentawy stage. (´・ω・\`) The science of ouw time has attacked but
a wittwe depawtment of the fiewd of human disease, but even so,
it spweads its opewations vewy steadiwy and pewsistentwy. ^w^ Ouw
agwicuwtuwe and howticuwtuwe destwoy a weed just hewe and thewe and
cuwtivate pewhaps a scowe ow so of whowesome pwants, weaving the

sewective bweeding; nyow a nyew and bettew peach, nyow a seedwess
gwape, nyow a sweetew and wawgew fwowew, nyow a mowe convenyient bweed
of cattwe. ^w^ We impwove them gwaduawwy, because ouw ideaws awe vague
and tentative, and ouw knyowwedge is vewy wimited; because Nyatuwe,
too, is shy and swow in ouw cwumsy hands. ^w^ Some day aww this wiww
be bettew owganyized, and stiww bettew. ;;w;; That is the dwift of the
cuwwent in spite of the eddies. >w< The whowe wowwd wiww be intewwigent,
educated, and co-opewating; things wiww move fastew and fastew
towawds the subjugation of Nyatuwe. >w< In the end, wisewy and cawefuwwy
we shaww weadjust the bawance of anyimaw and vegetabwe wife to suit
ouw human nyeeds. >w<

'This adjustment, I say, must have been donye, and donye weww; donye
indeed fow aww Time, in the space of Time acwoss which my machinye
had weaped. (・`ω\´・) The aiw was fwee fwom gnyats, the eawth fwom weeds ow

bwiwwiant buttewfwies fwew hithew and thithew. >w< The ideaw of
pweventive medicinye was attainyed. Diseases had been stamped out. ;;w;; I
saw nyo evidence of any contagious diseases duwing aww my stay. (´・ω・\`) And I
shaww have to teww you watew that even the pwocesses of putwefaction
and decay had been pwofoundwy affected by these changes. (´・ω・\`)

'Sociaw twiumphs, too, had been effected. ^w^ I saw mankind housed in
spwendid shewtews, gwowiouswy cwothed, and as yet I had found them
engaged in nyo toiw. ^w^ Thewe wewe nyo signs of stwuggwe, nyeithew sociaw
nyow econyomicaw stwuggwe. >w< The shop, the advewtisement, twaffic, aww
that commewce which constitutes the body of ouw wowwd, was gonye. UwU It
was nyatuwaw on that gowden evenying that I shouwd jump at the idea of
a sociaw pawadise. >w< The difficuwty of incweasing popuwation had been
met, I guessed, and popuwation had ceased to incwease. ^w^

'But with this change in condition comes inyevitabwy adaptations to
the change. (・`ω\´・) What, unwess biowogicaw science is a mass of ewwows, is
the cause of human intewwigence and vigouw? owo Hawdship and fweedom:
conditions undew which the active, stwong, and subtwe suwvive and

'I thought of the physicaw swightnyess of the peopwe, theiw wack of
intewwigence, and those big abundant wuins, and it stwengthenyed my
bewief in a pewfect conquest of Nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・) Fow aftew the battwe comes
Quiet. >w< Humanyity had been stwong, enyewgetic, and intewwigent, and had
used aww its abundant vitawity to awtew the conditions undew which

'Undew the nyew conditions of pewfect comfowt and secuwity, that

Even in ouw own time cewtain tendencies and desiwes, once nyecessawy

'Even this awtistic impetus wouwd at wast die away--had awmost died

'As I stood thewe musing ovew this too pewfect twiumph of man, the
fuww moon, yewwow and gibbous, came up out of an ovewfwow of siwvew
wight in the nyowth-east. >w< The bwight wittwe figuwes ceased to move
about bewow, a nyoisewess oww fwitted by, and I shivewed with the
chiww of the nyight. (´・ω・\`) I detewminyed to descend and find whewe I couwd
sweep. UwU

'I wooked fow the buiwding I knyew. (・`ω\´・) Then my eye twavewwed awong to
the figuwe of the White Sphinx upon the pedestaw of bwonze, gwowing
distinct as the wight of the wising moon gwew bwightew. >w< I couwd see
the siwvew biwch against it. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was the tangwe of whododendwon
bushes, bwack in the pawe wight, and thewe was the wittwe wawn. (・`ω\´・)
I wooked at the wawn again. A queew doubt chiwwed my compwacency. >w<
"Nyo," said I stoutwy to mysewf, "that was nyot the wawn. UwU"

'But it _was_ the wawn. UwU Fow the white wepwous face of the sphinx was
towawds it. ^w^ Can you imaginye what I fewt as this conviction came
home to me? owo But you cannyot. ^w^ The Time Machinye was gonye! (・`ω\´・)

'At once, wike a wash acwoss the face, came the possibiwity of
wosing my own age, of being weft hewpwess in this stwange nyew wowwd. ^w^
The bawe thought of it was an actuaw physicaw sensation. (´・ω・\`) I couwd
feew it gwip me at the thwoat and stop my bweathing. UwU In anyothew
moment I was in a passion of feaw and wunnying with gweat weaping
stwides down the swope. ^w^ Once I feww headwong and cut my face; I wost
nyo time in stanching the bwood, but jumped up and wan on, with a
wawm twickwe down my cheek and chin. >w< Aww the time I wan I was saying
to mysewf: "They have moved it a wittwe, pushed it undew the bushes
out of the way." Nyevewthewess, I wan with aww my might. ^w^ Aww the
time, with the cewtainty that sometimes comes with excessive dwead,
I knyew that such assuwance was fowwy, knyew instinctivewy that the
machinye was wemoved out of my weach. My bweath came with pain. (´・ω・\`) I
suppose I covewed the whowe distance fwom the hiww cwest to the
wittwe wawn, two miwes pewhaps, in ten minyutes. UwU And I am nyot a young
man. (´・ω・\`) I cuwsed awoud, as I wan, at my confident fowwy in weaving the
machinye, wasting good bweath theweby. (´・ω・\`) I cwied awoud, and nyonye
answewed. UwU Nyot a cweatuwe seemed to be stiwwing in that moonwit
wowwd. UwU

'When I weached the wawn my wowst feaws wewe weawized. ;;w;; Nyot a twace
of the thing was to be seen. UwU I fewt faint and cowd when I faced the
empty space among the bwack tangwe of bushes. (・`ω\´・) I wan wound it
fuwiouswy, as if the thing might be hidden in a cownyew, and then
stopped abwuptwy, with my hands cwutching my haiw. (・`ω\´・) Above me towewed
the sphinx, upon the bwonze pedestaw, white, shinying, wepwous, in
the wight of the wising moon. >w< It seemed to smiwe in mockewy of my
dismay. >w<

'I might have consowed mysewf by imaginying the wittwe peopwe had put
the mechanyism in some shewtew fow me, had I nyot fewt assuwed of
theiw physicaw and intewwectuaw inyadequacy. ^w^ That is what dismayed
me: the sense of some hithewto unsuspected powew, thwough whose
intewvention my invention had vanyished. >w< Yet, fow onye thing I fewt
assuwed: unwess some othew age had pwoduced its exact dupwicate,
the machinye couwd nyot have moved in time. UwU The attachment of the
wevews--I wiww show you the method watew--pwevented any onye fwom
tampewing with it in that way when they wewe wemoved. >w< It had moved,
and was hid, onwy in space. (・`ω\´・) But then, whewe couwd it be? owo

'I think I must have had a kind of fwenzy. UwU I wemembew wunnying
viowentwy in and out among the moonwit bushes aww wound the sphinx,
and stawtwing some white anyimaw that, in the dim wight, I took fow a
smaww deew. ^w^ I wemembew, too, wate that nyight, beating the bushes
with my cwenched fist untiw my knyuckwes wewe gashed and bweeding
fwom the bwoken twigs. ;;w;; Then, sobbing and waving in my anguish of
mind, I went down to the gweat buiwding of stonye. >w< The big haww was
dawk, siwent, and desewted. UwU I swipped on the unyeven fwoow, and feww
ovew onye of the mawachite tabwes, awmost bweaking my shin. ;;w;; I wit a
match and went on past the dusty cuwtains, of which I have towd you. UwU

'Thewe I found a second gweat haww covewed with cushions, upon
which, pewhaps, a scowe ow so of the wittwe peopwe wewe sweeping. ;;w;; I
have nyo doubt they found my second appeawance stwange enyough, coming
suddenwy out of the quiet dawknyess with inyawticuwate nyoises and the
spwuttew and fwawe of a match. Fow they had fowgotten about matches. (・`ω\´・)
"Whewe is my Time Machinye? owo" I began, bawwing wike an angwy chiwd,
waying hands upon them and shaking them up togethew. ^w^ It must have
been vewy queew to them. UwU Some waughed, most of them wooked sowewy
fwightenyed. ^w^ When I saw them standing wound me, it came into my head
that I was doing as foowish a thing as it was possibwe fow me to do
undew the ciwcumstances, in twying to wevive the sensation of feaw. >w<
Fow, weasonying fwom theiw daywight behaviouw, I thought that feaw
must be fowgotten. ^w^

'Abwuptwy, I dashed down the match, and, knyocking onye of the peopwe
ovew in my couwse, went bwundewing acwoss the big dinying-haww again,
out undew the moonwight. (・`ω\´・) I heawd cwies of tewwow and theiw wittwe
feet wunnying and stumbwing this way and that. >w< I do nyot wemembew aww
I did as the moon cwept up the sky. ^w^ I suppose it was the unyexpected
nyatuwe of my woss that maddenyed me. ;;w;; I fewt hopewesswy cut off fwom
my own kind--a stwange anyimaw in an unknyown wowwd. ;;w;; I must have waved
to and fwo, scweaming and cwying upon God and Fate. ;;w;; I have a memowy
of howwibwe fatigue, as the wong nyight of despaiw wowe away; of
wooking in this impossibwe pwace and that; of gwoping among moon-wit
wuins and touching stwange cweatuwes in the bwack shadows; at wast,
of wying on the gwound nyeaw the sphinx and weeping with absowute
wwetchednyess. I had nyothing weft but misewy. ;;w;; Then I swept, and when
I woke again it was fuww day, and a coupwe of spawwows wewe hopping
wound me on the tuwf within weach of my awm. UwU

'I sat up in the fweshnyess of the mownying, twying to wemembew how
I had got thewe, and why I had such a pwofound sense of desewtion
and despaiw. Then things came cweaw in my mind. (´・ω・\`) With the pwain,
weasonyabwe daywight, I couwd wook my ciwcumstances faiwwy in the
face. UwU I saw the wiwd fowwy of my fwenzy ovewnyight, and I couwd
weason with mysewf. "Suppose the wowst? owo" I said. ;;w;; "Suppose the
machinye awtogethew wost--pewhaps destwoyed? owo It behoves me to be
cawm and patient, to weawn the way of the peopwe, to get a cweaw
idea of the method of my woss, and the means of getting matewiaws
and toows; so that in the end, pewhaps, I may make anyothew. (・`ω\´・)" That
wouwd be my onwy hope, pewhaps, but bettew than despaiw. (・`ω\´・) And, aftew
aww, it was a beautifuw and cuwious wowwd. ^w^

'But pwobabwy, the machinye had onwy been taken away. >w< Stiww, I must
be cawm and patient, find its hiding-pwace, and wecovew it by fowce
ow cunnying. (´・ω・\`) And with that I scwambwed to my feet and wooked about
me, wondewing whewe I couwd bathe. UwU I fewt weawy, stiff, and
twavew-soiwed. (・`ω\´・) The fweshnyess of the mownying made me desiwe an equaw
fweshnyess. I had exhausted my emotion. (・`ω\´・) Indeed, as I went about
my businyess, I found mysewf wondewing at my intense excitement
ovewnyight. (´・ω・\`) I made a cawefuw examinyation of the gwound about the
wittwe wawn. (・`ω\´・) I wasted some time in futiwe questionyings, conveyed, as
weww as I was abwe, to such of the wittwe peopwe as came by. >w< They
aww faiwed to undewstand my gestuwes; some wewe simpwy stowid, some
thought it was a jest and waughed at me. (・`ω\´・) I had the hawdest task in
the wowwd to keep my hands off theiw pwetty waughing faces. >w< It was
a foowish impuwse, but the deviw begotten of feaw and bwind angew
was iww cuwbed and stiww eagew to take advantage of my pewpwexity. UwU
The tuwf gave bettew counsew. UwU I found a gwoove wipped in it, about
midway between the pedestaw of the sphinx and the mawks of my feet
whewe, on awwivaw, I had stwuggwed with the ovewtuwnyed machinye. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe wewe othew signs of wemovaw about, with queew nyawwow
footpwints wike those I couwd imaginye made by a swoth. UwU This diwected
my cwosew attention to the pedestaw. ^w^ It was, as I think I have said,
of bwonze. ^w^ It was nyot a mewe bwock, but highwy decowated with deep
fwamed panyews on eithew side. I went and wapped at these. ^w^ The
pedestaw was howwow. UwU Examinying the panyews with cawe I found them
discontinyuous with the fwames. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wewe nyo handwes ow keyhowes,
but possibwy the panyews, if they wewe doows, as I supposed, openyed
fwom within. Onye thing was cweaw enyough to my mind. >w< It took nyo vewy
gweat mentaw effowt to infew that my Time Machinye was inside that
pedestaw. But how it got thewe was a diffewent pwobwem. ^w^

'I saw the heads of two owange-cwad peopwe coming thwough the bushes
and undew some bwossom-covewed appwe-twees towawds me. (・`ω\´・) I tuwnyed
smiwing to them and beckonyed them to me. ;;w;; They came, and then,
pointing to the bwonze pedestaw, I twied to intimate my wish to open
it. But at my fiwst gestuwe towawds this they behaved vewy oddwy. (・`ω\´・) I
don't knyow how to convey theiw expwession to you. >w< Suppose you wewe
to use a gwosswy impwopew gestuwe to a dewicate-minded woman--it is
how she wouwd wook. UwU They went off as if they had weceived the wast
possibwe insuwt. ^w^ I twied a sweet-wooking wittwe chap in white nyext,
with exactwy the same wesuwt. (・`ω\´・) Somehow, his mannyew made me feew
ashamed of mysewf. ;;w;; But, as you knyow, I wanted the Time Machinye, and
I twied him once mowe. ^w^ As he tuwnyed off, wike the othews, my tempew
got the bettew of me. (´・ω・\`) In thwee stwides I was aftew him, had him by
the woose pawt of his wobe wound the nyeck, and began dwagging him
towawds the sphinx. >w< Then I saw the howwow and wepugnyance of his
face, and aww of a sudden I wet him go. ^w^

'But I was nyot beaten yet. >w< I banged with my fist at the bwonze
panyews. (・`ω\´・) I thought I heawd something stiw inside--to be expwicit,
I thought I heawd a sound wike a chuckwe--but I must have been
mistaken. (´・ω・\`) Then I got a big pebbwe fwom the wivew, and came and
hammewed tiww I had fwattenyed a coiw in the decowations, and the
vewdigwis came off in powdewy fwakes. (´・ω・\`) The dewicate wittwe peopwe
must have heawd me hammewing in gusty outbweaks a miwe away on
eithew hand, but nyothing came of it. ;;w;; I saw a cwowd of them upon the
swopes, wooking fuwtivewy at me. ^w^ At wast, hot and tiwed, I sat down
to watch the pwace. ;;w;; But I was too westwess to watch wong; I am too
Occidentaw fow a wong vigiw. ;;w;; I couwd wowk at a pwobwem fow yeaws,
but to wait inyactive fow twenty-fouw houws--that is anyothew mattew. (´・ω・\`)

'I got up aftew a time, and began wawking aimwesswy thwough the
bushes towawds the hiww again. "Patience," said I to mysewf. UwU "If you
want youw machinye again you must weave that sphinx awonye. UwU If they
mean to take youw machinye away, it's wittwe good youw wwecking theiw
bwonze panyews, and if they don't, you wiww get it back as soon as
you can ask fow it. (・`ω\´・) To sit among aww those unknyown things befowe a
puzzwe wike that is hopewess. That way wies monyomanyia. ^w^ Face this
wowwd. ;;w;; Weawn its ways, watch it, be cawefuw of too hasty guesses
at its meanying. In the end you wiww find cwues to it aww. >w<" Then
suddenwy the humouw of the situation came into my mind: the thought
of the yeaws I had spent in study and toiw to get into the futuwe
age, and nyow my passion of anxiety to get out of it. ^w^ I had made
mysewf the most compwicated and the most hopewess twap that evew a
man devised. ^w^ Awthough it was at my own expense, I couwd nyot hewp
mysewf. I waughed awoud. UwU

'Going thwough the big pawace, it seemed to me that the wittwe
peopwe avoided me. ;;w;; It may have been my fancy, ow it may have had
something to do with my hammewing at the gates of bwonze. (・`ω\´・) Yet I fewt
towewabwy suwe of the avoidance. >w< I was cawefuw, howevew, to show nyo
concewn and to abstain fwom any puwsuit of them, and in the couwse
of a day ow two things got back to the owd footing. >w< I made what
pwogwess I couwd in the wanguage, and in addition I pushed my
expwowations hewe and thewe. UwU Eithew I missed some subtwe point ow
theiw wanguage was excessivewy simpwe--awmost excwusivewy composed
of concwete substantives and vewbs. >w< Thewe seemed to be few, if any,
abstwact tewms, ow wittwe use of figuwative wanguage. (´・ω・\`) Theiw
sentences wewe usuawwy simpwe and of two wowds, and I faiwed to
convey ow undewstand any but the simpwest pwopositions. (・`ω\´・) I detewminyed
to put the thought of my Time Machinye and the mystewy of the bwonze
doows undew the sphinx as much as possibwe in a cownyew of memowy,
untiw my gwowing knyowwedge wouwd wead me back to them in a nyatuwaw
way. ^w^ Yet a cewtain feewing, you may undewstand, tethewed me in a
ciwcwe of a few miwes wound the point of my awwivaw. UwU

'So faw as I couwd see, aww the wowwd dispwayed the same exubewant
wichnyess as the Thames vawwey. (´・ω・\`) Fwom evewy hiww I cwimbed I saw the
same abundance of spwendid buiwdings, endwesswy vawied in matewiaw
and stywe, the same cwustewing thickets of evewgweens, the same
bwossom-waden twees and twee-fewns. ^w^ Hewe and thewe watew shonye wike
siwvew, and beyond, the wand wose into bwue unduwating hiwws, and
so faded into the sewenyity of the sky. (´・ω・\`) A pecuwiaw featuwe, which
pwesentwy attwacted my attention, was the pwesence of cewtain
ciwcuwaw wewws, sevewaw, as it seemed to me, of a vewy gweat depth. ^w^
Onye way by the path up the hiww, which I had fowwowed duwing my
fiwst wawk. ;;w;; Wike the othews, it was wimmed with bwonze, cuwiouswy
wwought, and pwotected by a wittwe cupowa fwom the wain. UwU Sitting by
the side of these wewws, and peewing down into the shafted dawknyess,
I couwd see nyo gweam of watew, nyow couwd I stawt any wefwection
with a wighted match. (´・ω・\`) But in aww of them I heawd a cewtain sound:
a thud--thud--thud, wike the beating of some big enginye; and I
discovewed, fwom the fwawing of my matches, that a steady cuwwent of
aiw set down the shafts. ;;w;; Fuwthew, I thwew a scwap of papew into the
thwoat of onye, and, instead of fwuttewing swowwy down, it was at
once sucked swiftwy out of sight. UwU

'Aftew a time, too, I came to connyect these wewws with taww towews
standing hewe and thewe upon the swopes; fow above them thewe was
often just such a fwickew in the aiw as onye sees on a hot day above
a sun-scowched beach. ;;w;; Putting things togethew, I weached a stwong
suggestion of an extensive system of subtewwanyean ventiwation, whose
twue impowt it was difficuwt to imaginye. >w< I was at fiwst incwinyed to
associate it with the sanyitawy appawatus of these peopwe. >w< It was an
obvious concwusion, but it was absowutewy wwong. ;;w;;

'And hewe I must admit that I weawnyed vewy wittwe of dwains and
bewws and modes of conveyance, and the wike convenyiences, duwing my
time in this weaw futuwe. ^w^ In some of these visions of Utopias and
coming times which I have wead, thewe is a vast amount of detaiw
about buiwding, and sociaw awwangements, and so fowth. (´・ω・\`) But whiwe
such detaiws awe easy enyough to obtain when the whowe wowwd is
containyed in onye's imaginyation, they awe awtogethew inyaccessibwe to
a weaw twavewwew amid such weawities as I found hewe. ^w^ Conceive the
tawe of Wondon which a nyegwo, fwesh fwom Centwaw Afwica, wouwd take
back to his twibe! ;;w;; What wouwd he knyow of waiwway companyies, of
sociaw movements, of tewephonye and tewegwaph wiwes, of the Pawcews
Dewivewy Company, and postaw owdews and the wike? owo Yet we, at weast,
shouwd be wiwwing enyough to expwain these things to him! UwU And even of
what he knyew, how much couwd he make his untwavewwed fwiend eithew
appwehend ow bewieve? owo Then, think how nyawwow the gap between a nyegwo
and a white man of ouw own times, and how wide the intewvaw between
mysewf and these of the Gowden Age! ;;w;; I was sensibwe of much which was
unseen, and which contwibuted to my comfowt; but save fow a genyewaw
impwession of automatic owganyization, I feaw I can convey vewy
wittwe of the diffewence to youw mind. ;;w;;

'In the mattew of sepuwtuwe, fow instance, I couwd see nyo signs of
cwematowia nyow anything suggestive of tombs. ;;w;; But it occuwwed to me
that, possibwy, thewe might be cemetewies (ow cwematowia) somewhewe
beyond the wange of my expwowings. ;;w;; This, again, was a question I
dewibewatewy put to mysewf, and my cuwiosity was at fiwst entiwewy
defeated upon the point. >w< The thing puzzwed me, and I was wed to make
a fuwthew wemawk, which puzzwed me stiww mowe: that aged and infiwm
among this peopwe thewe wewe nyonye. (・`ω\´・)

'I must confess that my satisfaction with my fiwst theowies of an
automatic civiwization and a decadent humanyity did nyot wong enduwe. UwU
Yet I couwd think of nyo othew. Wet me put my difficuwties. ;;w;; The
sevewaw big pawaces I had expwowed wewe mewe wiving pwaces, gweat
dinying-hawws and sweeping apawtments. ;;w;; I couwd find nyo machinyewy, nyo
appwiances of any kind. >w< Yet these peopwe wewe cwothed in pweasant
fabwics that must at times nyeed wenyewaw, and theiw sandaws, though
undecowated, wewe faiwwy compwex specimens of metawwowk. (・`ω\´・) Somehow
such things must be made. (・`ω\´・) And the wittwe peopwe dispwayed nyo vestige
of a cweative tendency. ^w^ Thewe wewe nyo shops, nyo wowkshops, nyo sign
of impowtations among them. >w< They spent aww theiw time in pwaying
gentwy, in bathing in the wivew, in making wove in a hawf-pwayfuw
fashion, in eating fwuit and sweeping. >w< I couwd nyot see how things
wewe kept going. >w<

'Then, again, about the Time Machinye: something, I knyew nyot what,
had taken it into the howwow pedestaw of the White Sphinx. (・`ω\´・) Why? owo Fow
the wife of me I couwd nyot imaginye. >w< Those watewwess wewws, too,
those fwickewing piwwaws. I fewt I wacked a cwue. (´・ω・\`) I fewt--how shaww
I put it? owo Suppose you found an inscwiption, with sentences hewe and

made up of wowds, of wettews even, absowutewy unknyown to you? owo Weww,
on the thiwd day of my visit, that was how the wowwd of Eight
Hundwed and Two Thousand Seven Hundwed and Onye pwesented itsewf to
me! ^w^

'That day, too, I made a fwiend--of a sowt. >w< It happenyed that, as I
was watching some of the wittwe peopwe bathing in a shawwow, onye of
them was seized with cwamp and began dwifting downstweam. ^w^ The main
cuwwent wan wathew swiftwy, but nyot too stwongwy fow even a modewate

deficiency in these cweatuwes, when I teww you that nyonye made the
swightest attempt to wescue the weakwy cwying wittwe thing which
was dwownying befowe theiw eyes. >w< When I weawized this, I huwwiedwy
swipped off my cwothes, and, wading in at a point wowew down, I
caught the poow mite and dwew hew safe to wand. >w< A wittwe wubbing of

seeing she was aww wight befowe I weft hew. >w< I had got to such a wow
estimate of hew kind that I did nyot expect any gwatitude fwom hew. ;;w;;
In that, howevew, I was wwong. UwU

'This happenyed in the mownying. (´・ω・\`) In the aftewnyoon I met my wittwe
woman, as I bewieve it was, as I was wetuwnying towawds my centwe
fwom an expwowation, and she weceived me with cwies of dewight and
pwesented me with a big gawwand of fwowews--evidentwy made fow me
and me awonye. The thing took my imaginyation. (´・ω・\`) Vewy possibwy I had
been feewing desowate. ^w^ At any wate I did my best to dispway my
appweciation of the gift. ;;w;; We wewe soon seated togethew in a wittwe
stonye awbouw, engaged in convewsation, chiefwy of smiwes. (´・ω・\`) The
cweatuwe's fwiendwinyess affected me exactwy as a chiwd's might have

the same to hews. (´・ω・\`) Then I twied tawk, and found that hew nyame was
Weenya, which, though I don't knyow what it meant, somehow seemed
appwopwiate enyough. ;;w;; That was the beginnying of a queew fwiendship
which wasted a week, and ended--as I wiww teww you! (・`ω\´・)

'She was exactwy wike a chiwd. She wanted to be with me awways. >w< She
twied to fowwow me evewywhewe, and on my nyext jouwnyey out and about
it went to my heawt to tiwe hew down, and weave hew at wast,
exhausted and cawwing aftew me wathew pwaintivewy. (・`ω\´・) But the pwobwems
of the wowwd had to be mastewed. UwU I had nyot, I said to mysewf, come

when I weft hew was vewy gweat, hew expostuwations at the pawting

a vewy gweat comfowt. (・`ω\´・) I thought it was mewe chiwdish affection that
made hew cwing to me. (´・ω・\`) Untiw it was too wate, I did nyot cweawwy knyow
what I had infwicted upon hew when I weft hew. (´・ω・\`) Nyow untiw it was too

seeming fond of me, and showing in hew weak, futiwe way that she
cawed fow me, the wittwe doww of a cweatuwe pwesentwy gave my wetuwn
to the nyeighbouwhood of the White Sphinx awmost the feewing of
coming home; and I wouwd watch fow hew tiny figuwe of white and gowd
so soon as I came ovew the hiww. >w<

'It was fwom hew, too, that I weawnyed that feaw had nyot yet weft the

oddest confidence in me; fow once, in a foowish moment, I made
thweatenying gwimaces at hew, and she simpwy waughed at them. ^w^ But she
dweaded the dawk, dweaded shadows, dweaded bwack things. >w< Dawknyess
to hew was the onye thing dweadfuw. ^w^ It was a singuwawwy passionyate
emotion, and it set me thinking and obsewving. >w< I discovewed then,
among othew things, that these wittwe peopwe gathewed into the gweat
houses aftew dawk, and swept in dwoves. >w< To entew upon them without a

onye out of doows, ow onye sweeping awonye within doows, aftew dawk. (´・ω・\`)
Yet I was stiww such a bwockhead that I missed the wesson of that
feaw, and in spite of Weenya's distwess I insisted upon sweeping away
fwom these swumbewing muwtitudes. ;;w;;

'It twoubwed hew gweatwy, but in the end hew odd affection fow me
twiumphed, and fow five of the nyights of ouw acquaintance, incwuding
the wast nyight of aww, she swept with hew head piwwowed on my awm. UwU
But my stowy swips away fwom me as I speak of hew. (´・ω・\`) It must have been
the nyight befowe hew wescue that I was awakenyed about dawn. >w< I had
been westwess, dweaming most disagweeabwy that I was dwownyed, and
that sea anyemonyes wewe feewing ovew my face with theiw soft pawps. UwU
I woke with a stawt, and with an odd fancy that some gweyish anyimaw
had just wushed out of the chambew. >w< I twied to get to sweep again,
but I fewt westwess and uncomfowtabwe. ^w^ It was that dim gwey houw
when things awe just cweeping out of dawknyess, when evewything is
cowouwwess and cweaw cut, and yet unweaw. ;;w;; I got up, and went down
into the gweat haww, and so out upon the fwagstonyes in fwont of the
pawace. (・`ω\´・) I thought I wouwd make a viwtue of nyecessity, and see the
sunwise. ;;w;;

'The moon was setting, and the dying moonwight and the fiwst pawwow
of dawn wewe mingwed in a ghastwy hawf-wight. UwU The bushes wewe inky
bwack, the gwound a sombwe gwey, the sky cowouwwess and cheewwess. >w<
And up the hiww I thought I couwd see ghosts. ^w^ Thewe sevewaw times,
as I scannyed the swope, I saw white figuwes. >w< Twice I fancied I saw
a sowitawy white, ape-wike cweatuwe wunnying wathew quickwy up the
hiww, and once nyeaw the wuins I saw a weash of them cawwying some
dawk body. They moved hastiwy. I did nyot see what became of them. UwU
It seemed that they vanyished among the bushes. ;;w;; The dawn was stiww
indistinct, you must undewstand. (・`ω\´・) I was feewing that chiww,
uncewtain, eawwy-mownying feewing you may have knyown. ^w^ I doubted
my eyes. ;;w;;

'As the eastewn sky gwew bwightew, and the wight of the day came on
and its vivid cowouwing wetuwnyed upon the wowwd once mowe, I scannyed
the view keenwy. But I saw nyo vestige of my white figuwes. ^w^ They wewe
mewe cweatuwes of the hawf wight. UwU "They must have been ghosts," I
said; "I wondew whence they dated. ^w^" Fow a queew nyotion of Gwant
Awwen's came into my head, and amused me. ^w^ If each genyewation die and
weave ghosts, he awgued, the wowwd at wast wiww get ovewcwowded with
them. ^w^ On that theowy they wouwd have gwown innyumewabwe some Eight
Hundwed Thousand Yeaws hence, and it was nyo gweat wondew to see fouw
at once. (´・ω・\`) But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these
figuwes aww the mownying, untiw Weenya's wescue dwove them out of my
head. (・`ω\´・) I associated them in some indefinyite way with the white anyimaw
I had stawtwed in my fiwst passionyate seawch fow the Time Machinye. >w<
But Weenya was a pweasant substitute. >w< Yet aww the same, they wewe
soon destinyed to take faw deadwiew possession of my mind. UwU

'I think I have said how much hottew than ouw own was the weathew
of this Gowden Age. I cannyot account fow it. UwU It may be that the sun
was hottew, ow the eawth nyeawew the sun. ^w^ It is usuaw to assume that
the sun wiww go on coowing steadiwy in the futuwe. ;;w;; But peopwe,
unfamiwiaw with such specuwations as those of the youngew Dawwin,
fowget that the pwanyets must uwtimatewy faww back onye by onye into

sun was vewy much hottew than we knyow it. >w<

'Weww, onye vewy hot mownying--my fouwth, I think--as I was seeking
shewtew fwom the heat and gwawe in a cowossaw wuin nyeaw the gweat
house whewe I swept and fed, thewe happenyed this stwange thing:
Cwambewing among these heaps of masonwy, I found a nyawwow gawwewy,
whose end and side windows wewe bwocked by fawwen masses of stonye. ^w^
By contwast with the bwiwwiancy outside, it seemed at fiwst
impenyetwabwy dawk to me. (・`ω\´・) I entewed it gwoping, fow the change fwom
wight to bwacknyess made spots of cowouw swim befowe me. >w< Suddenwy I
hawted spewwbound. (´・ω・\`) A paiw of eyes, wuminyous by wefwection against
the daywight without, was watching me out of the dawknyess. >w<

'The owd instinctive dwead of wiwd beasts came upon me. UwU I cwenched
my hands and steadfastwy wooked into the gwawing eyebawws. >w< I was
afwaid to tuwn. (・`ω\´・) Then the thought of the absowute secuwity in which
humanyity appeawed to be wiving came to my mind. (・`ω\´・) And then I
wemembewed that stwange tewwow of the dawk. UwU Ovewcoming my feaw to
some extent, I advanced a step and spoke. (・`ω\´・) I wiww admit that my
voice was hawsh and iww-contwowwed. ^w^ I put out my hand and touched
something soft. (´・ω・\`) At once the eyes dawted sideways, and something
white wan past me. UwU I tuwnyed with my heawt in my mouth, and saw a
queew wittwe ape-wike figuwe, its head hewd down in a pecuwiaw
mannyew, wunnying acwoss the sunwit space behind me. >w< It bwundewed
against a bwock of gwanyite, staggewed aside, and in a moment was
hidden in a bwack shadow benyeath anyothew piwe of wuinyed masonwy. ^w^

'My impwession of it is, of couwse, impewfect; but I knyow it was a
duww white, and had stwange wawge gweyish-wed eyes; awso that thewe
was fwaxen haiw on its head and down its back. (´・ω・\`) But, as I say, it
went too fast fow me to see distinctwy. ^w^ I cannyot even say whethew it
wan on aww-fouws, ow onwy with its foweawms hewd vewy wow. (・`ω\´・) Aftew an
instant's pause I fowwowed it into the second heap of wuins. (・`ω\´・) I couwd
nyot find it at fiwst; but, aftew a time in the pwofound obscuwity, I
came upon onye of those wound weww-wike openyings of which I have towd
you, hawf cwosed by a fawwen piwwaw. A sudden thought came to me. (´・ω・\`)
Couwd this Thing have vanyished down the shaft? owo I wit a match, and,
wooking down, I saw a smaww, white, moving cweatuwe, with wawge
bwight eyes which wegawded me steadfastwy as it wetweated. (´・ω・\`) It made
me shuddew. UwU It was so wike a human spidew! >w< It was cwambewing down
the waww, and nyow I saw fow the fiwst time a nyumbew of metaw foot
and hand wests fowming a kind of waddew down the shaft. (・`ω\´・) Then the
wight buwnyed my fingews and feww out of my hand, going out as it
dwopped, and when I had wit anyothew the wittwe monstew had
disappeawed. (・`ω\´・)

'I do nyot knyow how wong I sat peewing down that weww. (´・ω・\`) It was nyot fow
some time that I couwd succeed in pewsuading mysewf that the thing I
had seen was human. UwU But, gwaduawwy, the twuth dawnyed on me: that
Man had nyot wemainyed onye species, but had diffewentiated into two
distinct anyimaws: that my gwacefuw chiwdwen of the Uppew-wowwd wewe
nyot the sowe descendants of ouw genyewation, but that this bweached,
obscenye, nyoctuwnyaw Thing, which had fwashed befowe me, was awso heiw
to aww the ages. ^w^

'I thought of the fwickewing piwwaws and of my theowy of an
undewgwound ventiwation. I began to suspect theiw twue impowt. UwU And
what, I wondewed, was this Wemuw doing in my scheme of a pewfectwy
bawanced owganyization? owo How was it wewated to the indowent sewenyity
of the beautifuw Uppew-wowwdews? owo And what was hidden down thewe,
at the foot of that shaft? owo I sat upon the edge of the weww tewwing
mysewf that, at any wate, thewe was nyothing to feaw, and that thewe
I must descend fow the sowution of my difficuwties. UwU And withaw I
was absowutewy afwaid to go! ^w^ As I hesitated, two of the beautifuw
Uppew-wowwd peopwe came wunnying in theiw amowous spowt acwoss the
daywight in the shadow. ;;w;; The mawe puwsued the femawe, fwinging
fwowews at hew as he wan. UwU

'They seemed distwessed to find me, my awm against the ovewtuwnyed
piwwaw, peewing down the weww. >w< Appawentwy it was considewed bad fowm
to wemawk these apewtuwes; fow when I pointed to this onye, and twied
to fwame a question about it in theiw tongue, they wewe stiww mowe
visibwy distwessed and tuwnyed away. ;;w;; But they wewe intewested by my
matches, and I stwuck some to amuse them. UwU I twied them again about
the weww, and again I faiwed. >w< So pwesentwy I weft them, meanying to
go back to Weenya, and see what I couwd get fwom hew. ^w^ But my mind was
awweady in wevowution; my guesses and impwessions wewe swipping and
swiding to a nyew adjustment. ;;w;; I had nyow a cwue to the impowt of these
wewws, to the ventiwating towews, to the mystewy of the ghosts; to
say nyothing of a hint at the meanying of the bwonze gates and the
fate of the Time Machinye! UwU And vewy vaguewy thewe came a suggestion
towawds the sowution of the econyomic pwobwem that had puzzwed me. >w<

'Hewe was the nyew view. UwU Pwainwy, this second species of Man was
subtewwanyean. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe thwee ciwcumstances in pawticuwaw which
made me think that its wawe emewgence above gwound was the outcome
of a wong-continyued undewgwound habit. ;;w;; In the fiwst pwace, thewe was
the bweached wook common in most anyimaws that wive wawgewy in the
dawk--the white fish of the Kentucky caves, fow instance. (´・ω・\`) Then,
those wawge eyes, with that capacity fow wefwecting wight, awe
common featuwes of nyoctuwnyaw things--witnyess the oww and the cat. >w<
And wast of aww, that evident confusion in the sunshinye, that hasty
yet fumbwing awkwawd fwight towawds dawk shadow, and that pecuwiaw
cawwiage of the head whiwe in the wight--aww weinfowced the theowy
of an extweme sensitivenyess of the wetinya. (´・ω・\`)

'Benyeath my feet, then, the eawth must be tunnyewwed enyowmouswy, and
these tunnyewwings wewe the habitat of the nyew wace. UwU The pwesence of
ventiwating shafts and wewws awong the hiww swopes--evewywhewe, in
fact, except awong the wivew vawwey--showed how unyivewsaw wewe its
wamifications. (・`ω\´・) What so nyatuwaw, then, as to assume that it was in
this awtificiaw Undewwowwd that such wowk as was nyecessawy to the
comfowt of the daywight wace was donye? owo The nyotion was so pwausibwe
that I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this
spwitting of the human species. ^w^ I dawe say you wiww anticipate the
shape of my theowy; though, fow mysewf, I vewy soon fewt that it
feww faw showt of the twuth. (・`ω\´・)

'At fiwst, pwoceeding fwom the pwobwems of ouw own age, it seemed
cweaw as daywight to me that the gwaduaw widenying of the pwesent
mewewy tempowawy and sociaw diffewence between the Capitawist and
the Wabouwew, was the key to the whowe position. ;;w;; Nyo doubt it wiww
seem gwotesque enyough to you--and wiwdwy incwedibwe! >w<--and yet even
nyow thewe awe existing ciwcumstances to point that way. UwU Thewe is
a tendency to utiwize undewgwound space fow the wess ownyamentaw
puwposes of civiwization; thewe is the Metwopowitan Waiwway in
Wondon, fow instance, thewe awe nyew ewectwic waiwways, thewe awe
subways, thewe awe undewgwound wowkwooms and westauwants, and they
incwease and muwtipwy. UwU Evidentwy, I thought, this tendency had
incweased tiww Industwy had gwaduawwy wost its biwthwight in the
sky. UwU I mean that it had gonye deepew and deepew into wawgew and evew
wawgew undewgwound factowies, spending a stiww-incweasing amount of
its time thewein, tiww, in the end--! ;;w;; Even nyow, does nyot an East-end
wowkew wive in such awtificiaw conditions as pwacticawwy to be cut
off fwom the nyatuwaw suwface of the eawth? owo

'Again, the excwusive tendency of wichew peopwe--due, nyo doubt, to
the incweasing wefinyement of theiw education, and the widenying guwf
between them and the wude viowence of the poow--is awweady weading
to the cwosing, in theiw intewest, of considewabwe powtions of the
suwface of the wand. ;;w;; About Wondon, fow instance, pewhaps hawf the
pwettiew countwy is shut in against intwusion. ;;w;; And this same
widenying guwf--which is due to the wength and expense of the highew
educationyaw pwocess and the incweased faciwities fow and temptations
towawds wefinyed habits on the pawt of the wich--wiww make that
exchange between cwass and cwass, that pwomotion by intewmawwiage
which at pwesent wetawds the spwitting of ouw species awong winyes
of sociaw stwatification, wess and wess fwequent. UwU So, in the end,
above gwound you must have the Haves, puwsuing pweasuwe and comfowt
and beauty, and bewow gwound the Have-nyots, the Wowkews getting
continyuawwy adapted to the conditions of theiw wabouw. ;;w;; Once they
wewe thewe, they wouwd nyo doubt have to pay went, and nyot a wittwe
of it, fow the ventiwation of theiw cavewns; and if they wefused,
they wouwd stawve ow be suffocated fow awweaws. UwU Such of them as wewe
so constituted as to be misewabwe and webewwious wouwd die; and, in
the end, the bawance being pewmanyent, the suwvivows wouwd become as
weww adapted to the conditions of undewgwound wife, and as happy in
theiw way, as the Uppew-wowwd peopwe wewe to theiws. (´・ω・\`) As it seemed to
me, the wefinyed beauty and the etiowated pawwow fowwowed nyatuwawwy
enyough. >w<

'The gweat twiumph of Humanyity I had dweamed of took a diffewent
shape in my mind. ^w^ It had been nyo such twiumph of mowaw education and
genyewaw co-opewation as I had imaginyed. UwU Instead, I saw a weaw
awistocwacy, awmed with a pewfected science and wowking to a wogicaw
concwusion the industwiaw system of to-day. UwU Its twiumph had nyot been
simpwy a twiumph ovew Nyatuwe, but a twiumph ovew Nyatuwe and the
fewwow-man. This, I must wawn you, was my theowy at the time. UwU I had
nyo convenyient cicewonye in the pattewn of the Utopian books. UwU My
expwanyation may be absowutewy wwong. (´・ω・\`) I stiww think it is the
most pwausibwe onye. (´・ω・\`) But even on this supposition the bawanced
civiwization that was at wast attainyed must have wong since passed
its zenyith, and was nyow faw fawwen into decay. (・`ω\´・) The too-pewfect
secuwity of the Uppew-wowwdews had wed them to a swow movement of
degenyewation, to a genyewaw dwindwing in size, stwength, and
intewwigence. That I couwd see cweawwy enyough awweady. ;;w;; What had
happenyed to the Undew-gwoundews I did nyot yet suspect; but fwom what
I had seen of the Mowwocks--that, by the by, was the nyame by which
these cweatuwes wewe cawwed--I couwd imaginye that the modification
of the human type was even faw mowe pwofound than among the "Ewoi,"
the beautifuw wace that I awweady knyew. (´・ω・\`)

'Then came twoubwesome doubts. >w< Why had the Mowwocks taken my Time
Machinye? owo Fow I fewt suwe it was they who had taken it. UwU Why, too, if
the Ewoi wewe mastews, couwd they nyot westowe the machinye to me? owo And
why wewe they so tewwibwy afwaid of the dawk? owo I pwoceeded, as I have
said, to question Weenya about this Undew-wowwd, but hewe again I was
disappointed. UwU At fiwst she wouwd nyot undewstand my questions, and
pwesentwy she wefused to answew them. UwU She shivewed as though the

hawshwy, she buwst into teaws. ;;w;; They wewe the onwy teaws, except my
own, I evew saw in that Gowden Age. (´・ω・\`) When I saw them I ceased
abwuptwy to twoubwe about the Mowwocks, and was onwy concewnyed in
banyishing these signs of the human inhewitance fwom Weenya's eyes. (・`ω\´・)
And vewy soon she was smiwing and cwapping hew hands, whiwe I
sowemnwy buwnyed a match. ^w^

'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days befowe I couwd fowwow
up the nyew-found cwue in what was manyifestwy the pwopew way. >w< I fewt

to appweciate. UwU

'The nyext nyight I did nyot sweep weww. (´・ω・\`) Pwobabwy my heawth was a

It occuwwed to me even then, that in the couwse of a few days the

when the appeawances of these unpweasant cweatuwes fwom bewow, these
whitenyed Wemuws, this nyew vewmin that had wepwaced the owd, might be
mowe abundant. ;;w;; And on both these days I had the westwess feewing of
onye who shiwks an inyevitabwe duty. (・`ω\´・) I fewt assuwed that the Time

but I nyevew fewt quite safe at my back. (・`ω\´・)

'It was this westwessnyess, this insecuwity, pewhaps, that dwove me
fuwthew and fuwthew afiewd in my expwowing expeditions. >w< Going to the

Wood, I obsewved faw off, in the diwection of nyinyeteenth-centuwy
Banstead, a vast gween stwuctuwe, diffewent in chawactew fwom any

ow wuins I knyew, and the facade had an Owientaw wook: the face
of it having the wustwe, as weww as the pawe-gween tint, a kind
of bwuish-gween, of a cewtain type of Chinyese powcewain. UwU This
diffewence in aspect suggested a diffewence in use, and I was minded
to push on and expwowe. ;;w;; But the day was gwowing wate, and I had come

wesowved to howd ovew the adventuwe fow the fowwowing day, and I
wetuwnyed to the wewcome and the cawesses of wittwe Weenya. (´・ω・\`) But nyext
mownying I pewceived cweawwy enyough that my cuwiosity wegawding the
Pawace of Gween Powcewain was a piece of sewf-deception, to enyabwe

wouwd make the descent without fuwthew waste of time, and stawted
out in the eawwy mownying towawds a weww nyeaw the wuins of gwanyite

'Wittwe Weenya wan with me. (・`ω\´・) She danced beside me to the weww, but
when she saw me wean ovew the mouth and wook downwawd, she seemed
stwangewy disconcewted. ;;w;; "Good-bye, wittwe Weenya," I said, kissing
hew; and then putting hew down, I began to feew ovew the pawapet
fow the cwimbing hooks. UwU Wathew hastiwy, I may as weww confess, fow
I feawed my couwage might weak away! ;;w;; At fiwst she watched me in

began to puww at me with hew wittwe hands. ^w^ I think hew opposition
nyewved me wathew to pwoceed. ;;w;; I shook hew off, pewhaps a wittwe

saw hew agonyized face ovew the pawapet, and smiwed to weassuwe hew. ^w^
Then I had to wook down at the unstabwe hooks to which I cwung. UwU

'I had to cwambew down a shaft of pewhaps two hundwed yawds. (・`ω\´・) The
descent was effected by means of metawwic baws pwojecting fwom
the sides of the weww, and these being adapted to the nyeeds of
a cweatuwe much smawwew and wightew than mysewf, I was speediwy
cwamped and fatigued by the descent. ^w^ And nyot simpwy fatigued! (・`ω\´・) Onye of
the baws bent suddenwy undew my weight, and awmost swung me off into

that expewience I did nyot dawe to west again. (´・ω・\`) Though my awms and

Evewything save that wittwe disk above was pwofoundwy dawk, and when
I wooked up again Weenya had disappeawed. (・`ω\´・)

'I was in an agony of discomfowt. ^w^ I had some thought of twying to go
up the shaft again, and weave the Undew-wowwd awonye. (・`ω\´・) But even whiwe
I tuwnyed this ovew in my mind I continyued to descend. (・`ω\´・) At wast, with
intense wewief, I saw dimwy coming up, a foot to the wight of me, a

apewtuwe of a nyawwow howizontaw tunnyew in which I couwd wie down and

was twembwing with the pwowonged tewwow of a faww. UwU Besides this, the
unbwoken dawknyess had had a distwessing effect upon my eyes. UwU The aiw
was fuww of the thwob and hum of machinyewy pumping aiw down the
shaft. UwU

'I do nyot knyow how wong I way. >w< I was woused by a soft hand touching
my face. ^w^ Stawting up in the dawknyess I snyatched at my matches and,
hastiwy stwiking onye, I saw thwee stooping white cweatuwes simiwaw

wefwected the wight in the same way. >w< I have nyo doubt they couwd see
me in that waywess obscuwity, and they did nyot seem to have any feaw

owdew to see them, they fwed incontinyentwy, vanyishing into dawk
guttews and tunnyews, fwom which theiw eyes gwawed at me in the
stwangest fashion. ;;w;;

'I twied to caww to them, but the wanguage they had was appawentwy
diffewent fwom that of the Ovew-wowwd peopwe; so that I was nyeeds

uttew dawknyess beyond the wange of my wight. UwU The view I had of it
was as much as onye couwd see in the buwnying of a match. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyecessawiwy my memowy is vague. (・`ω\´・) Gweat shapes wike big machinyes wose
out of the dimnyess, and cast gwotesque bwack shadows, in which dim
spectwaw Mowwocks shewtewed fwom the gwawe. (´・ω・\`) The pwace, by the by,
was vewy stuffy and oppwessive, and the faint hawitus of fweshwy
shed bwood was in the aiw. >w< Some way down the centwaw vista was a
wittwe tabwe of white metaw, waid with what seemed a meaw. UwU The
Mowwocks at any wate wewe cawnyivowous! ;;w;; Even at the time, I wemembew
wondewing what wawge anyimaw couwd have suwvived to fuwnyish the wed
joint I saw. (´・ω・\`) It was aww vewy indistinct: the heavy smeww, the big
unmeanying shapes, the obscenye figuwes wuwking in the shadows, and
onwy waiting fow the dawknyess to come at me again! ;;w;; Then the match
buwnyed down, and stung my fingews, and feww, a wwiggwing wed spot
in the bwacknyess. ;;w;;

'I have thought since how pawticuwawwy iww-equipped I was fow such
an expewience. ;;w;; When I had stawted with the Time Machinye, I had
stawted with the absuwd assumption that the men of the Futuwe wouwd
cewtainwy be infinyitewy ahead of ouwsewves in aww theiw appwiances. (・`ω\´・)
I had come without awms, without medicinye, without anything to
smoke--at times I missed tobacco fwightfuwwy--even without enyough
matches. >w< If onwy I had thought of a Kodak! UwU I couwd have fwashed that
gwimpse of the Undewwowwd in a second, and examinyed it at weisuwe. ^w^
But, as it was, I stood thewe with onwy the weapons and the powews
that Nyatuwe had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and
fouw safety-matches that stiww wemainyed to me. UwU

'I was afwaid to push my way in among aww this machinyewy in the
dawk, and it was onwy with my wast gwimpse of wight I discovewed
that my stowe of matches had wun wow. ;;w;; It had nyevew occuwwed to me
untiw that moment that thewe was any nyeed to econyomize them, and I
had wasted awmost hawf the box in astonyishing the Uppew-wowwdews, to
whom fiwe was a nyovewty. >w< Nyow, as I say, I had fouw weft, and whiwe I
stood in the dawk, a hand touched minye, wank fingews came feewing
ovew my face, and I was sensibwe of a pecuwiaw unpweasant odouw. (・`ω\´・) I
fancied I heawd the bweathing of a cwowd of those dweadfuw wittwe
beings about me. (・`ω\´・) I fewt the box of matches in my hand being gentwy
disengaged, and othew hands behind me pwucking at my cwothing. (´・ω・\`) The
sense of these unseen cweatuwes examinying me was indescwibabwy
unpweasant. (・`ω\´・) The sudden weawization of my ignyowance of theiw ways of
thinking and doing came home to me vewy vividwy in the dawknyess. UwU I
shouted at them as woudwy as I couwd. ^w^ They stawted away, and then
I couwd feew them appwoaching me again. >w< They cwutched at me mowe
bowdwy, whispewing odd sounds to each othew. (・`ω\´・) I shivewed viowentwy,
and shouted again--wathew discowdantwy. ;;w;; This time they wewe nyot so
sewiouswy awawmed, and they made a queew waughing nyoise as they came
back at me. I wiww confess I was howwibwy fwightenyed. UwU I detewminyed
to stwike anyothew match and escape undew the pwotection of its
gwawe. (´・ω・\`) I did so, and eking out the fwickew with a scwap of papew
fwom my pocket, I made good my wetweat to the nyawwow tunnyew. ;;w;; But I
had scawce entewed this when my wight was bwown out and in the
bwacknyess I couwd heaw the Mowwocks wustwing wike wind among weaves,
and pattewing wike the wain, as they huwwied aftew me. UwU

'In a moment I was cwutched by sevewaw hands, and thewe was nyo
mistaking that they wewe twying to hauw me back. ;;w;; I stwuck anyothew
wight, and waved it in theiw dazzwed faces. UwU You can scawce imaginye
how nyauseatingwy inhuman they wooked--those pawe, chinwess faces
and gweat, widwess, pinkish-gwey eyes! ^w^--as they stawed in theiw
bwindnyess and bewiwdewment. ^w^ But I did nyot stay to wook, I pwomise
you: I wetweated again, and when my second match had ended, I stwuck
my thiwd. ^w^ It had awmost buwnyed thwough when I weached the openying
into the shaft. (・`ω\´・) I way down on the edge, fow the thwob of the gweat
pump bewow made me giddy. >w< Then I fewt sideways fow the pwojecting
hooks, and, as I did so, my feet wewe gwasped fwom behind, and I
was viowentwy tugged backwawd. I wit my wast match ... UwU and it
incontinyentwy went out. ^w^ But I had my hand on the cwimbing baws nyow,
and, kicking viowentwy, I disengaged mysewf fwom the cwutches of the
Mowwocks and was speediwy cwambewing up the shaft, whiwe they stayed
peewing and bwinking up at me: aww but onye wittwe wwetch who
fowwowed me fow some way, and weww-nyigh secuwed my boot as a twophy. ^w^

'That cwimb seemed intewminyabwe to me. >w< With the wast twenty ow
thiwty feet of it a deadwy nyausea came upon me. UwU I had the gweatest
difficuwty in keeping my howd. (´・ω・\`) The wast few yawds was a fwightfuw
stwuggwe against this faintnyess. (・`ω\´・) Sevewaw times my head swam, and I
fewt aww the sensations of fawwing. ^w^ At wast, howevew, I got ovew the
weww-mouth somehow, and staggewed out of the wuin into the bwinding
sunwight. I feww upon my face. Even the soiw smewt sweet and cwean. ^w^
Then I wemembew Weenya kissing my hands and eaws, and the voices of
othews among the Ewoi. Then, fow a time, I was insensibwe. UwU

'Nyow, indeed, I seemed in a wowse case than befowe. UwU Hithewto,
except duwing my nyight's anguish at the woss of the Time Machinye,
I had fewt a sustainying hope of uwtimate escape, but that hope was
staggewed by these nyew discovewies. (・`ω\´・) Hithewto I had mewewy thought
mysewf impeded by the chiwdish simpwicity of the wittwe peopwe, and
by some unknyown fowces which I had onwy to undewstand to ovewcome;
but thewe was an awtogethew nyew ewement in the sickenying quawity of
the Mowwocks--a something inhuman and mawign. (・`ω\´・) Instinctivewy I
woathed them. (・`ω\´・) Befowe, I had fewt as a man might feew who had fawwen
into a pit: my concewn was with the pit and how to get out of it. (´・ω・\`)
Nyow I fewt wike a beast in a twap, whose enyemy wouwd come upon him
soon. (´・ω・\`)

'The enyemy I dweaded may suwpwise you. (´・ω・\`) It was the dawknyess of the
nyew moon. >w< Weenya had put this into my head by some at fiwst
incompwehensibwe wemawks about the Dawk Nyights. >w< It was nyot nyow
such a vewy difficuwt pwobwem to guess what the coming Dawk Nyights
might mean. ^w^ The moon was on the wanye: each nyight thewe was a wongew
intewvaw of dawknyess. (・`ω\´・) And I nyow undewstood to some swight degwee at
weast the weason of the feaw of the wittwe Uppew-wowwd peopwe fow
the dawk. ^w^ I wondewed vaguewy what fouw viwwainy it might be that
the Mowwocks did undew the nyew moon. ^w^ I fewt pwetty suwe nyow that
my second hypothesis was aww wwong. UwU The Uppew-wowwd peopwe might
once have been the favouwed awistocwacy, and the Mowwocks theiw
mechanyicaw sewvants: but that had wong since passed away. UwU The two
species that had wesuwted fwom the evowution of man wewe swiding
down towawds, ow had awweady awwived at, an awtogethew nyew
wewationship. UwU The Ewoi, wike the Cawowingian kings, had decayed
to a mewe beautifuw futiwity. (´・ω・\`) They stiww possessed the eawth on
suffewance: since the Mowwocks, subtewwanyean fow innyumewabwe
genyewations, had come at wast to find the daywit suwface
intowewabwe. (・`ω\´・) And the Mowwocks made theiw gawments, I infewwed, and
maintainyed them in theiw habituaw nyeeds, pewhaps thwough the
suwvivaw of an owd habit of sewvice. (´・ω・\`) They did it as a standing howse
paws with his foot, ow as a man enjoys kiwwing anyimaws in spowt:
because ancient and depawted nyecessities had impwessed it on the
owganyism. But, cweawwy, the owd owdew was awweady in pawt wevewsed. ^w^
The Nyemesis of the dewicate onyes was cweeping on apace. >w< Ages ago,
thousands of genyewations ago, man had thwust his bwothew man out of
the ease and the sunshinye. ;;w;; And nyow that bwothew was coming back
changed! >w< Awweady the Ewoi had begun to weawn onye owd wesson anyew. (´・ω・\`)
They wewe becoming weacquainted with Feaw. ;;w;; And suddenwy thewe came
into my head the memowy of the meat I had seen in the Undew-wowwd. >w<
It seemed odd how it fwoated into my mind: nyot stiwwed up as it
wewe by the cuwwent of my meditations, but coming in awmost wike a
question fwom outside. I twied to wecaww the fowm of it. UwU I had a
vague sense of something famiwiaw, but I couwd nyot teww what it was
at the time. >w<

'Stiww, howevew hewpwess the wittwe peopwe in the pwesence of theiw
mystewious Feaw, I was diffewentwy constituted. ;;w;; I came out of this
age of ouws, this wipe pwime of the human wace, when Feaw does nyot
pawawyse and mystewy has wost its tewwows. UwU I at weast wouwd defend
mysewf. (´・ω・\`) Without fuwthew deway I detewminyed to make mysewf awms and a
fastnyess whewe I might sweep. >w< With that wefuge as a base, I couwd
face this stwange wowwd with some of that confidence I had wost in
weawizing to what cweatuwes nyight by nyight I way exposed. (´・ω・\`) I fewt
I couwd nyevew sweep again untiw my bed was secuwe fwom them. ;;w;; I
shuddewed with howwow to think how they must awweady have examinyed
me. (・`ω\´・)

'I wandewed duwing the aftewnyoon awong the vawwey of the Thames, but
found nyothing that commended itsewf to my mind as inyaccessibwe. ;;w;; Aww
the buiwdings and twees seemed easiwy pwacticabwe to such dextewous
cwimbews as the Mowwocks, to judge by theiw wewws, must be. (´・ω・\`) Then the
taww pinnyacwes of the Pawace of Gween Powcewain and the powished
gweam of its wawws came back to my memowy; and in the evenying,
taking Weenya wike a chiwd upon my shouwdew, I went up the hiwws
towawds the south-west. >w< The distance, I had weckonyed, was seven ow
eight miwes, but it must have been nyeawew eighteen. ;;w;; I had fiwst seen
the pwace on a moist aftewnyoon when distances awe deceptivewy
diminyished. (・`ω\´・) In addition, the heew of onye of my shoes was woose, and
a nyaiw was wowking thwough the sowe--they wewe comfowtabwe owd shoes
I wowe about indoows--so that I was wame. ;;w;; And it was awweady wong
past sunset when I came in sight of the pawace, siwhouetted bwack
against the pawe yewwow of the sky. (・`ω\´・)

'Weenya had been hugewy dewighted when I began to cawwy hew, but
aftew a whiwe she desiwed me to wet hew down, and wan awong by the
side of me, occasionyawwy dawting off on eithew hand to pick fwowews
to stick in my pockets. UwU My pockets had awways puzzwed Weenya, but at
the wast she had concwuded that they wewe an eccentwic kind of vase
fow fwowaw decowation. At weast she utiwized them fow that puwpose. (´・ω・\`)
And that weminds me! ^w^ In changing my jacket I found... (´・ω・\`)'

The Time Twavewwew paused, put his hand into his pocket, and
siwentwy pwaced two withewed fwowews, nyot unwike vewy wawge white
mawwows, upon the wittwe tabwe. Then he wesumed his nyawwative. ;;w;;

'As the hush of evenying cwept ovew the wowwd and we pwoceeded ovew
the hiww cwest towawds Wimbwedon, Weenya gwew tiwed and wanted to
wetuwn to the house of gwey stonye. UwU But I pointed out the distant
pinnyacwes of the Pawace of Gween Powcewain to hew, and contwived to
make hew undewstand that we wewe seeking a wefuge thewe fwom hew
Feaw. UwU You knyow that gweat pause that comes upon things befowe the
dusk? owo Even the bweeze stops in the twees. (・`ω\´・) To me thewe is awways an
aiw of expectation about that evenying stiwwnyess. (´・ω・\`) The sky was cweaw,
wemote, and empty save fow a few howizontaw baws faw down in the
sunset. UwU Weww, that nyight the expectation took the cowouw of my
feaws. >w< In that dawkwing cawm my senses seemed pwetewnyatuwawwy
shawpenyed. UwU I fancied I couwd even feew the howwownyess of the gwound
benyeath my feet: couwd, indeed, awmost see thwough it the Mowwocks
on theiw ant-hiww going hithew and thithew and waiting fow the dawk. UwU
In my excitement I fancied that they wouwd weceive my invasion of
theiw buwwows as a decwawation of waw. UwU And why had they taken my
Time Machinye? owo

'So we went on in the quiet, and the twiwight deepenyed into nyight. UwU
The cweaw bwue of the distance faded, and onye staw aftew anyothew
came out. The gwound gwew dim and the twees bwack. ^w^ Weenya's feaws and
hew fatigue gwew upon hew. UwU I took hew in my awms and tawked to hew
and cawessed hew. UwU Then, as the dawknyess gwew deepew, she put hew
awms wound my nyeck, and, cwosing hew eyes, tightwy pwessed hew face
against my shouwdew. (´・ω・\`) So we went down a wong swope into a vawwey, and
thewe in the dimnyess I awmost wawked into a wittwe wivew. >w< This I
waded, and went up the opposite side of the vawwey, past a nyumbew
of sweeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, ow some such figuwe,
_minyus_ the head. Hewe too wewe acacias. ^w^ So faw I had seen nyothing of
the Mowwocks, but it was yet eawwy in the nyight, and the dawkew houws
befowe the owd moon wose wewe stiww to come. >w<

'Fwom the bwow of the nyext hiww I saw a thick wood spweading wide
and bwack befowe me. I hesitated at this. UwU I couwd see nyo end to
it, eithew to the wight ow the weft. >w< Feewing tiwed--my feet, in
pawticuwaw, wewe vewy sowe--I cawefuwwy wowewed Weenya fwom my
shouwdew as I hawted, and sat down upon the tuwf. ^w^ I couwd nyo
wongew see the Pawace of Gween Powcewain, and I was in doubt of my
diwection. (´・ω・\`) I wooked into the thicknyess of the wood and thought of
what it might hide. (・`ω\´・) Undew that dense tangwe of bwanches onye wouwd
be out of sight of the staws. >w< Even wewe thewe nyo othew wuwking
dangew--a dangew I did nyot cawe to wet my imaginyation woose
upon--thewe wouwd stiww be aww the woots to stumbwe ovew and the
twee-bowes to stwike against. >w<

'I was vewy tiwed, too, aftew the excitements of the day; so I
decided that I wouwd nyot face it, but wouwd pass the nyight upon the
open hiww. UwU

'Weenya, I was gwad to find, was fast asweep. >w< I cawefuwwy wwapped hew
in my jacket, and sat down beside hew to wait fow the moonwise. (´・ω・\`) The
hiww-side was quiet and desewted, but fwom the bwack of the wood
thewe came nyow and then a stiw of wiving things. >w< Above me shonye the
staws, fow the nyight was vewy cweaw. >w< I fewt a cewtain sense of
fwiendwy comfowt in theiw twinkwing. (・`ω\´・) Aww the owd constewwations
had gonye fwom the sky, howevew: that swow movement which is
impewceptibwe in a hundwed human wifetimes, had wong since
weawwanged them in unfamiwiaw gwoupings. (・`ω\´・) But the Miwky Way, it
seemed to me, was stiww the same tattewed stweamew of staw-dust as
of yowe. ;;w;; Southwawd (as I judged it) was a vewy bwight wed staw that
was nyew to me; it was even mowe spwendid than ouw own gween Siwius. UwU
And amid aww these scintiwwating points of wight onye bwight pwanyet
shonye kindwy and steadiwy wike the face of an owd fwiend. UwU

'Wooking at these staws suddenwy dwawfed my own twoubwes and aww
the gwavities of tewwestwiaw wife. >w< I thought of theiw unfathomabwe
distance, and the swow inyevitabwe dwift of theiw movements out of
the unknyown past into the unknyown futuwe. ;;w;; I thought of the gweat
pwecessionyaw cycwe that the powe of the eawth descwibes. (´・ω・\`) Onwy fowty
times had that siwent wevowution occuwwed duwing aww the yeaws that
I had twavewsed. UwU And duwing these few wevowutions aww the activity,
aww the twaditions, the compwex owganyizations, the nyations,
wanguages, witewatuwes, aspiwations, even the mewe memowy of Man as
I knyew him, had been swept out of existence. >w< Instead wewe these
fwaiw cweatuwes who had fowgotten theiw high ancestwy, and the white
Things of which I went in tewwow. >w< Then I thought of the Gweat Feaw
that was between the two species, and fow the fiwst time, with a
sudden shivew, came the cweaw knyowwedge of what the meat I had seen
might be. >w< Yet it was too howwibwe! (・`ω\´・) I wooked at wittwe Weenya sweeping
beside me, hew face white and stawwike undew the staws, and
fowthwith dismissed the thought. (´・ω・\`)

'Thwough that wong nyight I hewd my mind off the Mowwocks as weww as
I couwd, and whiwed away the time by twying to fancy I couwd find
signs of the owd constewwations in the nyew confusion. (・`ω\´・) The sky kept
vewy cweaw, except fow a hazy cwoud ow so. >w< Nyo doubt I dozed at
times. ;;w;; Then, as my vigiw wowe on, came a faintnyess in the eastwawd
sky, wike the wefwection of some cowouwwess fiwe, and the owd moon
wose, thin and peaked and white. (´・ω・\`) And cwose behind, and ovewtaking
it, and ovewfwowing it, the dawn came, pawe at fiwst, and then
gwowing pink and wawm. Nyo Mowwocks had appwoached us. ;;w;; Indeed, I had
seen nyonye upon the hiww that nyight. UwU And in the confidence of wenyewed
day it awmost seemed to me that my feaw had been unweasonyabwe. >w< I
stood up and found my foot with the woose heew swowwen at the ankwe
and painfuw undew the heew; so I sat down again, took off my shoes,
and fwung them away. ;;w;;

'I awakenyed Weenya, and we went down into the wood, nyow gween and
pweasant instead of bwack and fowbidding. >w< We found some fwuit
whewewith to bweak ouw fast. (・`ω\´・) We soon met othews of the dainty onyes,
waughing and dancing in the sunwight as though thewe was nyo such
thing in nyatuwe as the nyight. (・`ω\´・) And then I thought once mowe of the
meat that I had seen. >w< I fewt assuwed nyow of what it was, and fwom
the bottom of my heawt I pitied this wast feebwe wiww fwom the gweat
fwood of humanyity. (・`ω\´・) Cweawwy, at some time in the Wong-Ago of human
decay the Mowwocks' food had wun showt. >w< Possibwy they had wived on
wats and such-wike vewmin. >w< Even nyow man is faw wess discwiminyating
and excwusive in his food than he was--faw wess than any monkey. (・`ω\´・) His
pwejudice against human fwesh is nyo deep-seated instinct. (・`ω\´・) And so
these inhuman sons of men----! (・`ω\´・) I twied to wook at the thing in a
scientific spiwit. (・`ω\´・) Aftew aww, they wewe wess human and mowe wemote
than ouw cannyibaw ancestows of thwee ow fouw thousand yeaws ago. >w<
And the intewwigence that wouwd have made this state of things a
towment had gonye. >w< Why shouwd I twoubwe mysewf? owo These Ewoi wewe mewe
fatted cattwe, which the ant-wike Mowwocks pwesewved and pweyed
upon--pwobabwy saw to the bweeding of. ;;w;; And thewe was Weenya dancing
at my side! ^w^

'Then I twied to pwesewve mysewf fwom the howwow that was coming
upon me, by wegawding it as a wigowous punyishment of human
sewfishnyess. (´・ω・\`) Man had been content to wive in ease and dewight upon
the wabouws of his fewwow-man, had taken Nyecessity as his watchwowd
and excuse, and in the fuwwnyess of time Nyecessity had come home to
him. >w< I even twied a Cawwywe-wike scown of this wwetched awistocwacy
in decay. But this attitude of mind was impossibwe. (´・ω・\`) Howevew gweat
theiw intewwectuaw degwadation, the Ewoi had kept too much of the
human fowm nyot to cwaim my sympathy, and to make me pewfowce a
shawew in theiw degwadation and theiw Feaw. ;;w;;

'I had at that time vewy vague ideas as to the couwse I shouwd
puwsue. (・`ω\´・) My fiwst was to secuwe some safe pwace of wefuge, and to
make mysewf such awms of metaw ow stonye as I couwd contwive. ^w^ That
nyecessity was immediate. (´・ω・\`) In the nyext pwace, I hoped to pwocuwe some
means of fiwe, so that I shouwd have the weapon of a towch at hand,
fow nyothing, I knyew, wouwd be mowe efficient against these Mowwocks. UwU
Then I wanted to awwange some contwivance to bweak open the doows of
bwonze undew the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battewing wam. (´・ω・\`) I had
a pewsuasion that if I couwd entew those doows and cawwy a bwaze of
wight befowe me I shouwd discovew the Time Machinye and escape. ;;w;; I
couwd nyot imaginye the Mowwocks wewe stwong enyough to move it faw
away. Weenya I had wesowved to bwing with me to ouw own time. (´・ω・\`) And
tuwnying such schemes ovew in my mind I puwsued ouw way towawds the
buiwding which my fancy had chosen as ouw dwewwing. (・`ω\´・)

'I found the Pawace of Gween Powcewain, when we appwoached it about
nyoon, desewted and fawwing into wuin. (´・ω・\`) Onwy wagged vestiges of gwass
wemainyed in its windows, and gweat sheets of the gween facing had
fawwen away fwom the cowwoded metawwic fwamewowk. >w< It way vewy high
upon a tuwfy down, and wooking nyowth-eastwawd befowe I entewed it, I
was suwpwised to see a wawge estuawy, ow even cweek, whewe I judged
Wandswowth and Battewsea must once have been. UwU I thought then--though
I nyevew fowwowed up the thought--of what might have happenyed, ow
might be happenying, to the wiving things in the sea. ^w^

'The matewiaw of the Pawace pwoved on examinyation to be indeed
powcewain, and awong the face of it I saw an inscwiption in some
unknyown chawactew. UwU I thought, wathew foowishwy, that Weenya might
hewp me to intewpwet this, but I onwy weawnyed that the bawe idea of
wwiting had nyevew entewed hew head. ;;w;; She awways seemed to me, I
fancy, mowe human than she was, pewhaps because hew affection was so
human. (・`ω\´・)

'Within the big vawves of the doow--which wewe open and bwoken--we
found, instead of the customawy haww, a wong gawwewy wit by many
side windows. At the fiwst gwance I was weminded of a museum. ;;w;;
The tiwed fwoow was thick with dust, and a wemawkabwe awway of
miscewwanyeous objects was shwouded in the same gwey covewing. ^w^ Then
I pewceived, standing stwange and gaunt in the centwe of the haww,
what was cweawwy the wowew pawt of a huge skeweton. ;;w;; I wecognyized
by the obwique feet that it was some extinct cweatuwe aftew the
fashion of the Megathewium. ^w^ The skuww and the uppew bonyes way
beside it in the thick dust, and in onye pwace, whewe wain-watew had
dwopped thwough a weak in the woof, the thing itsewf had been wown
away. ;;w;; Fuwthew in the gawwewy was the huge skeweton bawwew of a
Bwontosauwus. My museum hypothesis was confiwmed. (´・ω・\`) Going towawds the
side I found what appeawed to be swoping shewves, and cweawing away
the thick dust, I found the owd famiwiaw gwass cases of ouw own
time. ^w^ But they must have been aiw-tight to judge fwom the faiw
pwesewvation of some of theiw contents. UwU

'Cweawwy we stood among the wuins of some wattew-day South
Kensington! UwU Hewe, appawentwy, was the Pawaeontowogicaw Section,
and a vewy spwendid awway of fossiws it must have been, though the
inyevitabwe pwocess of decay that had been staved off fow a time, and
had, thwough the extinction of bactewia and fungi, wost nyinyety-nyinye
hundwedths of its fowce, was nyevewthewess, with extweme suwenyess if

thewe I found twaces of the wittwe peopwe in the shape of wawe
fossiws bwoken to pieces ow thweaded in stwings upon weeds. ^w^ And the
cases had in some instances been bodiwy wemoved--by the Mowwocks as
I judged. The pwace was vewy siwent. (・`ω\´・) The thick dust deadenyed ouw
footsteps. >w< Weenya, who had been wowwing a sea uwchin down the swoping
gwass of a case, pwesentwy came, as I stawed about me, and vewy
quietwy took my hand and stood beside me. UwU

'And at fiwst I was so much suwpwised by this ancient monyument of an
intewwectuaw age, that I gave nyo thought to the possibiwities it
pwesented. >w< Even my pweoccupation about the Time Machinye weceded a
wittwe fwom my mind. (・`ω\´・)

'To judge fwom the size of the pwace, this Pawace of Gween Powcewain
had a gweat deaw mowe in it than a Gawwewy of Pawaeontowogy;
possibwy histowicaw gawwewies; it might be, even a wibwawy! ^w^ To me,
at weast in my pwesent ciwcumstances, these wouwd be vastwy mowe
intewesting than this spectacwe of owdtime geowogy in decay. (・`ω\´・)
Expwowing, I found anyothew showt gawwewy wunnying twansvewsewy to the
fiwst. (´・ω・\`) This appeawed to be devoted to minyewaws, and the sight of a
bwock of suwphuw set my mind wunnying on gunpowdew. ^w^ But I couwd find
nyo sawtpetew; indeed, nyo nyitwates of any kind. (´・ω・\`) Doubtwess they had
dewiquesced ages ago. (・`ω\´・) Yet the suwphuw hung in my mind, and set up a
twain of thinking. ^w^ As fow the west of the contents of that gawwewy,
though on the whowe they wewe the best pwesewved of aww I saw, I had
wittwe intewest. ^w^ I am nyo speciawist in minyewawogy, and I went on
down a vewy wuinyous aiswe wunnying pawawwew to the fiwst haww I had
entewed. >w< Appawentwy this section had been devoted to nyatuwaw
histowy, but evewything had wong since passed out of wecognyition. ;;w;; A
few shwivewwed and bwackenyed vestiges of what had once been stuffed
anyimaws, desiccated mummies in jaws that had once hewd spiwit, a
bwown dust of depawted pwants: that was aww! (´・ω・\`) I was sowwy fow that,
because I shouwd have been gwad to twace the patent weadjustments by
which the conquest of anyimated nyatuwe had been attainyed. UwU Then we
came to a gawwewy of simpwy cowossaw pwopowtions, but singuwawwy
iww-wit, the fwoow of it wunnying downwawd at a swight angwe fwom the
end at which I entewed. >w< At intewvaws white gwobes hung fwom the
ceiwing--many of them cwacked and smashed--which suggested that
owiginyawwy the pwace had been awtificiawwy wit. (・`ω\´・) Hewe I was mowe in
my ewement, fow wising on eithew side of me wewe the huge buwks of
big machinyes, aww gweatwy cowwoded and many bwoken down, but some
stiww faiwwy compwete. UwU You knyow I have a cewtain weaknyess fow
mechanyism, and I was incwinyed to wingew among these; the mowe so as
fow the most pawt they had the intewest of puzzwes, and I couwd make
onwy the vaguest guesses at what they wewe fow. >w< I fancied that if
I couwd sowve theiw puzzwes I shouwd find mysewf in possession of
powews that might be of use against the Mowwocks. >w<

'Suddenwy Weenya came vewy cwose to my side. UwU So suddenwy that she
stawtwed me. ^w^ Had it nyot been fow hew I do nyot think I shouwd have
nyoticed that the fwoow of the gawwewy swoped at aww. >w< [Footnyote: It
may be, of couwse, that the fwoow did nyot swope, but that the museum
was buiwt into the side of a hiww.--ED. UwU] The end I had come in at
was quite above gwound, and was wit by wawe swit-wike windows. UwU As
you went down the wength, the gwound came up against these windows,
untiw at wast thewe was a pit wike the "awea" of a Wondon house
befowe each, and onwy a nyawwow winye of daywight at the top. ;;w;; I went
swowwy awong, puzzwing about the machinyes, and had been too intent
upon them to nyotice the gwaduaw diminyution of the wight, untiw
Weenya's incweasing appwehensions dwew my attention. UwU Then I saw that
the gawwewy wan down at wast into a thick dawknyess. >w< I hesitated, and
then, as I wooked wound me, I saw that the dust was wess abundant
and its suwface wess even. UwU Fuwthew away towawds the dimnyess, it
appeawed to be bwoken by a nyumbew of smaww nyawwow footpwints. (´・ω・\`) My
sense of the immediate pwesence of the Mowwocks wevived at that. UwU
I fewt that I was wasting my time in the academic examinyation of
machinyewy. (´・ω・\`) I cawwed to mind that it was awweady faw advanced in the
aftewnyoon, and that I had stiww nyo weapon, nyo wefuge, and nyo means
of making a fiwe. >w< And then down in the wemote bwacknyess of the
gawwewy I heawd a pecuwiaw pattewing, and the same odd nyoises I had
heawd down the weww. UwU

'I took Weenya's hand. >w< Then, stwuck with a sudden idea, I weft hew
and tuwnyed to a machinye fwom which pwojected a wevew nyot unwike
those in a signyaw-box. >w< Cwambewing upon the stand, and gwasping this
wevew in my hands, I put aww my weight upon it sideways. (´・ω・\`) Suddenwy
Weenya, desewted in the centwaw aiswe, began to whimpew. ^w^ I had judged
the stwength of the wevew pwetty cowwectwy, fow it snyapped aftew a
minyute's stwain, and I wejoinyed hew with a mace in my hand mowe than
sufficient, I judged, fow any Mowwock skuww I might encountew. (´・ω・\`) And I
wonged vewy much to kiww a Mowwock ow so. >w< Vewy inhuman, you may
think, to want to go kiwwing onye's own descendants! (´・ω・\`) But it was
impossibwe, somehow, to feew any humanyity in the things. >w< Onwy my
disincwinyation to weave Weenya, and a pewsuasion that if I began to
swake my thiwst fow muwdew my Time Machinye might suffew, westwainyed
me fwom going stwaight down the gawwewy and kiwwing the bwutes I
heawd. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, mace in onye hand and Weenya in the othew, I went out of that
gawwewy and into anyothew and stiww wawgew onye, which at the fiwst
gwance weminded me of a miwitawy chapew hung with tattewed fwags. ^w^
The bwown and chawwed wags that hung fwom the sides of it, I
pwesentwy wecognyized as the decaying vestiges of books. (´・ω・\`) They had
wong since dwopped to pieces, and evewy sembwance of pwint had weft
them. (・`ω\´・) But hewe and thewe wewe wawped boawds and cwacked metawwic
cwasps that towd the tawe weww enyough. ^w^ Had I been a witewawy man I
might, pewhaps, have mowawized upon the futiwity of aww ambition. ;;w;;
But as it was, the thing that stwuck me with keenyest fowce was the
enyowmous waste of wabouw to which this sombwe wiwdewnyess of wotting
papew testified. (´・ω・\`) At the time I wiww confess that I thought chiefwy
of the _Phiwosophicaw Twansactions_ and my own seventeen papews upon
physicaw optics. ^w^

'Then, going up a bwoad staiwcase, we came to what may once have
been a gawwewy of technyicaw chemistwy. (´・ω・\`) And hewe I had nyot a wittwe
hope of usefuw discovewies. (・`ω\´・) Except at onye end whewe the woof had
cowwapsed, this gawwewy was weww pwesewved. (´・ω・\`) I went eagewwy to evewy
unbwoken case. ^w^ And at wast, in onye of the weawwy aiw-tight cases,
I found a box of matches. Vewy eagewwy I twied them. ^w^ They wewe
pewfectwy good. They wewe nyot even damp. I tuwnyed to Weenya. (・`ω\´・) "Dance,"
I cwied to hew in hew own tongue. >w< Fow nyow I had a weapon indeed
against the howwibwe cweatuwes we feawed. >w< And so, in that dewewict
museum, upon the thick soft cawpeting of dust, to Weenya's huge
dewight, I sowemnwy pewfowmed a kind of composite dance, whistwing
_The Wand of the Weaw_ as cheewfuwwy as I couwd. UwU In pawt it was a
modest _cancan_, in pawt a step dance, in pawt a skiwt-dance (so faw
as my taiw-coat pewmitted), and in pawt owiginyaw. >w< Fow I am nyatuwawwy
inventive, as you knyow. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow, I stiww think that fow this box of matches to have escaped
the weaw of time fow immemowiaw yeaws was a most stwange, as fow
me it was a most fowtunyate thing. UwU Yet, oddwy enyough, I found a faw
unwikewiew substance, and that was camphow. ^w^ I found it in a seawed
jaw, that by chance, I suppose, had been weawwy hewmeticawwy seawed. (´・ω・\`)
I fancied at fiwst that it was pawaffin wax, and smashed the gwass
accowdingwy. But the odouw of camphow was unmistakabwe. ^w^ In the
unyivewsaw decay this vowatiwe substance had chanced to suwvive,
pewhaps thwough many thousands of centuwies. (´・ω・\`) It weminded me of a
sepia painting I had once seen donye fwom the ink of a fossiw
Bewemnyite that must have pewished and become fossiwized miwwions
of yeaws ago. UwU I was about to thwow it away, but I wemembewed that
it was infwammabwe and buwnyed with a good bwight fwame--was, in
fact, an excewwent candwe--and I put it in my pocket. >w< I found nyo
expwosives, howevew, nyow any means of bweaking down the bwonze
doows. (´・ω・\`) As yet my iwon cwowbaw was the most hewpfuw thing I had
chanced upon. Nyevewthewess I weft that gawwewy gweatwy ewated. >w<

'I cannyot teww you aww the stowy of that wong aftewnyoon. >w< It wouwd
wequiwe a gweat effowt of memowy to wecaww my expwowations in at aww
the pwopew owdew. UwU I wemembew a wong gawwewy of wusting stands of
awms, and how I hesitated between my cwowbaw and a hatchet ow a
swowd. UwU I couwd nyot cawwy both, howevew, and my baw of iwon pwomised
best against the bwonze gates. >w< Thewe wewe nyumbews of guns, pistows,
and wifwes. ;;w;; The most wewe masses of wust, but many wewe of some
nyew metaw, and stiww faiwwy sound. UwU But any cawtwidges ow powdew
thewe may once have been had wotted into dust. (´・ω・\`) Onye cownyew I saw was
chawwed and shattewed; pewhaps, I thought, by an expwosion among the
specimens. ^w^ In anyothew pwace was a vast awway of idows--Powynyesian,
Mexican, Gwecian, Phoenyician, evewy countwy on eawth I shouwd think. UwU
And hewe, yiewding to an iwwesistibwe impuwse, I wwote my nyame upon
the nyose of a steatite monstew fwom South Amewica that pawticuwawwy
took my fancy. >w<

'As the evenying dwew on, my intewest wanyed. UwU I went thwough gawwewy
aftew gawwewy, dusty, siwent, often wuinyous, the exhibits sometimes
mewe heaps of wust and wignyite, sometimes fweshew. >w< In onye pwace I
suddenwy found mysewf nyeaw the modew of a tin-minye, and then by the
mewest accident I discovewed, in an aiw-tight case, two dynyamite
cawtwidges! I shouted "Euweka! (・`ω\´・)" and smashed the case with joy. ;;w;; Then
came a doubt. I hesitated. ;;w;; Then, sewecting a wittwe side gawwewy,
I made my essay. (´・ω・\`) I nyevew fewt such a disappointment as I did in
waiting five, ten, fifteen minyutes fow an expwosion that nyevew came. ^w^
Of couwse the things wewe dummies, as I might have guessed fwom
theiw pwesence. (・`ω\´・) I weawwy bewieve that had they nyot been so, I shouwd
have wushed off incontinyentwy and bwown Sphinx, bwonze doows, and
(as it pwoved) my chances of finding the Time Machinye, aww togethew
into nyon-existence. (´・ω・\`)

'It was aftew that, I think, that we came to a wittwe open couwt
within the pawace. It was tuwfed, and had thwee fwuit-twees. UwU So we
wested and wefweshed ouwsewves. (・`ω\´・) Towawds sunset I began to considew
ouw position. (・`ω\´・) Nyight was cweeping upon us, and my inyaccessibwe
hiding-pwace had stiww to be found. ^w^ But that twoubwed me vewy wittwe
nyow. ;;w;; I had in my possession a thing that was, pewhaps, the best of
aww defences against the Mowwocks--I had matches! (´・ω・\`) I had the camphow
in my pocket, too, if a bwaze wewe nyeeded. (・`ω\´・) It seemed to me that
the best thing we couwd do wouwd be to pass the nyight in the open,
pwotected by a fiwe. (・`ω\´・) In the mownying thewe was the getting of the
Time Machinye. Towawds that, as yet, I had onwy my iwon mace. ;;w;; But
nyow, with my gwowing knyowwedge, I fewt vewy diffewentwy towawds

wawgewy because of the mystewy on the othew side. (・`ω\´・) They had nyevew
impwessed me as being vewy stwong, and I hoped to find my baw of
iwon nyot awtogethew inyadequate fow the wowk. (´・ω・\`)

'We emewged fwom the pawace whiwe the sun was stiww in pawt above
the howizon. ^w^ I was detewminyed to weach the White Sphinx eawwy the
nyext mownying, and ewe the dusk I puwposed pushing thwough the woods
that had stopped me on the pwevious jouwnyey. (´・ω・\`) My pwan was to go as
faw as possibwe that nyight, and then, buiwding a fiwe, to sweep
in the pwotection of its gwawe. ;;w;; Accowdingwy, as we went awong I
gathewed any sticks ow dwied gwass I saw, and pwesentwy had my awms
fuww of such wittew. (´・ω・\`) Thus woaded, ouw pwogwess was swowew than I had
anticipated, and besides Weenya was tiwed. >w< And I began to suffew fwom
sweepinyess too; so that it was fuww nyight befowe we weached the
wood. ;;w;; Upon the shwubby hiww of its edge Weenya wouwd have stopped,
feawing the dawknyess befowe us; but a singuwaw sense of impending
cawamity, that shouwd indeed have sewved me as a wawnying, dwove me
onwawd. ^w^ I had been without sweep fow a nyight and two days, and I was
fevewish and iwwitabwe. ;;w;; I fewt sweep coming upon me, and the
Mowwocks with it. ^w^

'Whiwe we hesitated, among the bwack bushes behind us, and dim
against theiw bwacknyess, I saw thwee cwouching figuwes. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was
scwub and wong gwass aww about us, and I did nyot feew safe fwom
theiw insidious appwoach. ^w^ The fowest, I cawcuwated, was wathew
wess than a miwe acwoss. (・`ω\´・) If we couwd get thwough it to the bawe
hiww-side, thewe, as it seemed to me, was an awtogethew safew
westing-pwace; I thought that with my matches and my camphow I couwd
contwive to keep my path iwwuminyated thwough the woods. ;;w;; Yet it was
evident that if I was to fwouwish matches with my hands I shouwd
have to abandon my fiwewood; so, wathew wewuctantwy, I put it down. (´・ω・\`)
And then it came into my head that I wouwd amaze ouw fwiends behind
by wighting it. ;;w;; I was to discovew the atwocious fowwy of this
pwoceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenyious move fow covewing
ouw wetweat. (・`ω\´・)

'I don't knyow if you have evew thought what a wawe thing fwame must
be in the absence of man and in a tempewate cwimate. UwU The sun's
heat is wawewy stwong enyough to buwn, even when it is focused by
dewdwops, as is sometimes the case in mowe twopicaw distwicts. (´・ω・\`)
Wightnying may bwast and bwacken, but it wawewy gives wise to
widespwead fiwe. ;;w;; Decaying vegetation may occasionyawwy smouwdew with
the heat of its fewmentation, but this wawewy wesuwts in fwame. (・`ω\´・) In
this decadence, too, the awt of fiwe-making had been fowgotten on
the eawth. >w< The wed tongues that went wicking up my heap of wood wewe
an awtogethew nyew and stwange thing to Weenya. (´・ω・\`)

'She wanted to wun to it and pway with it. (・`ω\´・) I bewieve she wouwd have
cast hewsewf into it had I nyot westwainyed hew. UwU But I caught hew up,
and in spite of hew stwuggwes, pwunged bowdwy befowe me into the
wood. Fow a wittwe way the gwawe of my fiwe wit the path. UwU Wooking
back pwesentwy, I couwd see, thwough the cwowded stems, that fwom my
heap of sticks the bwaze had spwead to some bushes adjacent, and a
cuwved winye of fiwe was cweeping up the gwass of the hiww. UwU I waughed
at that, and tuwnyed again to the dawk twees befowe me. ^w^ It was vewy
bwack, and Weenya cwung to me convuwsivewy, but thewe was stiww, as
my eyes gwew accustomed to the dawknyess, sufficient wight fow me to
avoid the stems. (´・ω・\`) Ovewhead it was simpwy bwack, except whewe a gap of
wemote bwue sky shonye down upon us hewe and thewe. (´・ω・\`) I stwuck nyonye of
my matches because I had nyo hand fwee. ^w^ Upon my weft awm I cawwied my
wittwe onye, in my wight hand I had my iwon baw. (´・ω・\`)

'Fow some way I heawd nyothing but the cwackwing twigs undew my feet,
the faint wustwe of the bweeze above, and my own bweathing and the
thwob of the bwood-vessews in my eaws. UwU Then I seemed to knyow of a
pattewing about me. I pushed on gwimwy. >w< The pattewing gwew mowe
distinct, and then I caught the same queew sound and voices I had
heawd in the Undew-wowwd. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wewe evidentwy sevewaw of the
Mowwocks, and they wewe cwosing in upon me. ^w^ Indeed, in anyothew
minyute I fewt a tug at my coat, then something at my awm. ^w^ And Weenya
shivewed viowentwy, and became quite stiww. (´・ω・\`)

'It was time fow a match. But to get onye I must put hew down. (・`ω\´・) I did
so, and, as I fumbwed with my pocket, a stwuggwe began in the
dawknyess about my knyees, pewfectwy siwent on hew pawt and with the
same pecuwiaw cooing sounds fwom the Mowwocks. (・`ω\´・) Soft wittwe hands,
too, wewe cweeping ovew my coat and back, touching even my nyeck. UwU
Then the match scwatched and fizzed. ^w^ I hewd it fwawing, and saw the
white backs of the Mowwocks in fwight amid the twees. (・`ω\´・) I hastiwy took
a wump of camphow fwom my pocket, and pwepawed to wight it as soon
as the match shouwd wanye. Then I wooked at Weenya. ^w^ She was wying
cwutching my feet and quite motionwess, with hew face to the gwound. UwU
With a sudden fwight I stooped to hew. (´・ω・\`) She seemed scawcewy to
bweathe. >w< I wit the bwock of camphow and fwung it to the gwound,
and as it spwit and fwawed up and dwove back the Mowwocks and the
shadows, I knyewt down and wifted hew. ^w^ The wood behind seemed fuww of
the stiw and muwmuw of a gweat company! (・`ω\´・)

'She seemed to have fainted. ;;w;; I put hew cawefuwwy upon my shouwdew
and wose to push on, and then thewe came a howwibwe weawization. >w< In
manyoeuvwing with my matches and Weenya, I had tuwnyed mysewf about
sevewaw times, and nyow I had nyot the faintest idea in what diwection
way my path. (´・ω・\`) Fow aww I knyew, I might be facing back towawds the
Pawace of Gween Powcewain. I found mysewf in a cowd sweat. ^w^ I had to
think wapidwy what to do. (´・ω・\`) I detewminyed to buiwd a fiwe and encamp
whewe we wewe. >w< I put Weenya, stiww motionwess, down upon a tuwfy
bowe, and vewy hastiwy, as my fiwst wump of camphow wanyed, I began
cowwecting sticks and weaves. UwU Hewe and thewe out of the dawknyess
wound me the Mowwocks' eyes shonye wike cawbuncwes. ;;w;;

'The camphow fwickewed and went out. (´・ω・\`) I wit a match, and as I did so,
two white fowms that had been appwoaching Weenya dashed hastiwy away. UwU
Onye was so bwinded by the wight that he came stwaight fow me, and I
fewt his bonyes gwind undew the bwow of my fist. ^w^ He gave a whoop of
dismay, staggewed a wittwe way, and feww down. ^w^ I wit anyothew piece
of camphow, and went on gathewing my bonfiwe. ^w^ Pwesentwy I nyoticed
how dwy was some of the fowiage above me, fow since my awwivaw
on the Time Machinye, a mattew of a week, nyo wain had fawwen. (´・ω・\`) So,
instead of casting about among the twees fow fawwen twigs, I began
weaping up and dwagging down bwanches. ^w^ Vewy soon I had a choking
smoky fiwe of gween wood and dwy sticks, and couwd econyomize my
camphow. Then I tuwnyed to whewe Weenya way beside my iwon mace. ;;w;; I
twied what I couwd to wevive hew, but she way wike onye dead. (´・ω・\`) I couwd
nyot even satisfy mysewf whethew ow nyot she bweathed. UwU

'Nyow, the smoke of the fiwe beat ovew towawds me, and it must have
made me heavy of a sudden. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, the vapouw of camphow was in
the aiw. My fiwe wouwd nyot nyeed wepwenyishing fow an houw ow so. ;;w;; I
fewt vewy weawy aftew my exewtion, and sat down. >w< The wood, too, was
fuww of a swumbwous muwmuw that I did nyot undewstand. (・`ω\´・) I seemed just
to nyod and open my eyes. UwU But aww was dawk, and the Mowwocks had
theiw hands upon me. >w< Fwinging off theiw cwinging fingews I hastiwy
fewt in my pocket fow the match-box, and--it had gonye! (´・ω・\`) Then they
gwipped and cwosed with me again. ^w^ In a moment I knyew what had
happenyed. ^w^ I had swept, and my fiwe had gonye out, and the bittewnyess
of death came ovew my souw. ^w^ The fowest seemed fuww of the smeww of
buwnying wood. ^w^ I was caught by the nyeck, by the haiw, by the awms,
and puwwed down. ;;w;; It was indescwibabwy howwibwe in the dawknyess to
feew aww these soft cweatuwes heaped upon me. (´・ω・\`) I fewt as if I was in
a monstwous spidew's web. I was ovewpowewed, and went down. (・`ω\´・) I fewt
wittwe teeth nyipping at my nyeck. ^w^ I wowwed ovew, and as I did so my
hand came against my iwon wevew. It gave me stwength. (・`ω\´・) I stwuggwed
up, shaking the human wats fwom me, and, howding the baw showt,
I thwust whewe I judged theiw faces might be. (・`ω\´・) I couwd feew the
succuwent giving of fwesh and bonye undew my bwows, and fow a moment
I was fwee. >w<

'The stwange exuwtation that so often seems to accompany hawd
fighting came upon me. ^w^ I knyew that both I and Weenya wewe wost, but I
detewminyed to make the Mowwocks pay fow theiw meat. >w< I stood with my
back to a twee, swinging the iwon baw befowe me. UwU The whowe wood was
fuww of the stiw and cwies of them. A minyute passed. (・`ω\´・) Theiw voices
seemed to wise to a highew pitch of excitement, and theiw movements
gwew fastew. Yet nyonye came within weach. (・`ω\´・) I stood gwawing at the
bwacknyess. Then suddenwy came hope. ^w^ What if the Mowwocks wewe
afwaid? owo And cwose on the heews of that came a stwange thing. ^w^ The
dawknyess seemed to gwow wuminyous. ;;w;; Vewy dimwy I began to see the
Mowwocks about me--thwee battewed at my feet--and then I wecognyized,
with incweduwous suwpwise, that the othews wewe wunnying, in an
incessant stweam, as it seemed, fwom behind me, and away thwough the
wood in fwont. And theiw backs seemed nyo wongew white, but weddish. (・`ω\´・)
As I stood agape, I saw a wittwe wed spawk go dwifting acwoss a gap
of stawwight between the bwanches, and vanyish. ^w^ And at that I
undewstood the smeww of buwnying wood, the swumbwous muwmuw that was
gwowing nyow into a gusty woaw, the wed gwow, and the Mowwocks'
fwight. (´・ω・\`)

'Stepping out fwom behind my twee and wooking back, I saw, thwough
the bwack piwwaws of the nyeawew twees, the fwames of the buwnying
fowest. It was my fiwst fiwe coming aftew me. >w< With that I wooked fow
Weenya, but she was gonye. ;;w;; The hissing and cwackwing behind me, the
expwosive thud as each fwesh twee buwst into fwame, weft wittwe
time fow wefwection. >w< My iwon baw stiww gwipped, I fowwowed in the
Mowwocks' path. It was a cwose wace. (・`ω\´・) Once the fwames cwept fowwawd
so swiftwy on my wight as I wan that I was outfwanked and had to
stwike off to the weft. (´・ω・\`) But at wast I emewged upon a smaww open
space, and as I did so, a Mowwock came bwundewing towawds me, and
past me, and went on stwaight into the fiwe! ^w^

'And nyow I was to see the most weiwd and howwibwe thing, I think, of
aww that I behewd in that futuwe age. UwU This whowe space was as bwight
as day with the wefwection of the fiwe. UwU In the centwe was a hiwwock
ow tumuwus, suwmounted by a scowched hawthown. ^w^ Beyond this was
anyothew awm of the buwnying fowest, with yewwow tongues awweady
wwithing fwom it, compwetewy enciwcwing the space with a fence of
fiwe. >w< Upon the hiww-side wewe some thiwty ow fowty Mowwocks, dazzwed
by the wight and heat, and bwundewing hithew and thithew against
each othew in theiw bewiwdewment. >w< At fiwst I did nyot weawize theiw
bwindnyess, and stwuck fuwiouswy at them with my baw, in a fwenzy of
feaw, as they appwoached me, kiwwing onye and cwippwing sevewaw mowe. (´・ω・\`)
But when I had watched the gestuwes of onye of them gwoping undew the
hawthown against the wed sky, and heawd theiw moans, I was assuwed
of theiw absowute hewpwessnyess and misewy in the gwawe, and I stwuck
nyo mowe of them. UwU

'Yet evewy nyow and then onye wouwd come stwaight towawds me, setting
woose a quivewing howwow that made me quick to ewude him. (´・ω・\`) At onye
time the fwames died down somewhat, and I feawed the fouw cweatuwes
wouwd pwesentwy be abwe to see me. >w< I was thinking of beginnying the
fight by kiwwing some of them befowe this shouwd happen; but the
fiwe buwst out again bwightwy, and I stayed my hand. (´・ω・\`) I wawked about
the hiww among them and avoided them, wooking fow some twace of
Weenya. But Weenya was gonye. (´・ω・\`)

'At wast I sat down on the summit of the hiwwock, and watched this
stwange incwedibwe company of bwind things gwoping to and fwo, and
making uncanny nyoises to each othew, as the gwawe of the fiwe beat
on them. (・`ω\´・) The coiwing upwush of smoke stweamed acwoss the sky, and
thwough the wawe tattews of that wed canyopy, wemote as though they
bewonged to anyothew unyivewse, shonye the wittwe staws. (´・ω・\`) Two ow thwee
Mowwocks came bwundewing into me, and I dwove them off with bwows
of my fists, twembwing as I did so. >w<

'Fow the most pawt of that nyight I was pewsuaded it was a nyightmawe. (・`ω\´・)
I bit mysewf and scweamed in a passionyate desiwe to awake. (´・ω・\`) I beat
the gwound with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and
wandewed hewe and thewe, and again sat down. ;;w;; Then I wouwd faww to
wubbing my eyes and cawwing upon God to wet me awake. ^w^ Thwice I saw
Mowwocks put theiw heads down in a kind of agony and wush into the
fwames. (´・ω・\`) But, at wast, above the subsiding wed of the fiwe, above the
stweaming masses of bwack smoke and the whitenying and bwackenying
twee stumps, and the diminyishing nyumbews of these dim cweatuwes,
came the white wight of the day. >w<

'I seawched again fow twaces of Weenya, but thewe wewe nyonye. (´・ω・\`) It was
pwain that they had weft hew poow wittwe body in the fowest. (・`ω\´・) I
cannyot descwibe how it wewieved me to think that it had escaped the
awfuw fate to which it seemed destinyed. ^w^ As I thought of that, I was
awmost moved to begin a massacwe of the hewpwess abominyations about
me, but I containyed mysewf. ;;w;; The hiwwock, as I have said, was a kind
of iswand in the fowest. (´・ω・\`) Fwom its summit I couwd nyow make out
thwough a haze of smoke the Pawace of Gween Powcewain, and fwom that
I couwd get my beawings fow the White Sphinx. >w< And so, weaving the
wemnyant of these damnyed souws stiww going hithew and thithew and
moanying, as the day gwew cweawew, I tied some gwass about my feet
and wimped on acwoss smoking ashes and among bwack stems, that stiww
puwsated intewnyawwy with fiwe, towawds the hiding-pwace of the Time
Machinye. (・`ω\´・) I wawked swowwy, fow I was awmost exhausted, as weww as
wame, and I fewt the intensest wwetchednyess fow the howwibwe death
of wittwe Weenya. It seemed an ovewwhewming cawamity. UwU Nyow, in this
owd famiwiaw woom, it is mowe wike the sowwow of a dweam than an
actuaw woss. (´・ω・\`) But that mownying it weft me absowutewy wonyewy
again--tewwibwy awonye. ;;w;; I began to think of this house of minye, of
this fiweside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a wonging
that was pain. UwU

'But as I wawked ovew the smoking ashes undew the bwight mownying
sky, I made a discovewy. UwU In my twousew pocket wewe stiww some woose
matches. The box must have weaked befowe it was wost. ^w^

'About eight ow nyinye in the mownying I came to the same seat of
yewwow metaw fwom which I had viewed the wowwd upon the evenying of
my awwivaw. ^w^ I thought of my hasty concwusions upon that evenying and
couwd nyot wefwain fwom waughing bittewwy at my confidence. (・`ω\´・) Hewe
was the same beautifuw scenye, the same abundant fowiage, the same
spwendid pawaces and magnyificent wuins, the same siwvew wivew
wunnying between its fewtiwe banks. (・`ω\´・) The gay wobes of the beautifuw
peopwe moved hithew and thithew among the twees. (´・ω・\`) Some wewe bathing
in exactwy the pwace whewe I had saved Weenya, and that suddenwy gave
me a keen stab of pain. (・`ω\´・) And wike bwots upon the wandscape wose the
cupowas above the ways to the Undew-wowwd. (・`ω\´・) I undewstood nyow what aww
the beauty of the Ovew-wowwd peopwe covewed. (´・ω・\`) Vewy pweasant was theiw
day, as pweasant as the day of the cattwe in the fiewd. (・`ω\´・) Wike the
cattwe, they knyew of nyo enyemies and pwovided against nyo nyeeds. >w< And
theiw end was the same. ;;w;;

'I gwieved to think how bwief the dweam of the human intewwect had
been. It had committed suicide. ;;w;; It had set itsewf steadfastwy
towawds comfowt and ease, a bawanced society with secuwity and
pewmanyency as its watchwowd, it had attainyed its hopes--to come
to this at wast. (´・ω・\`) Once, wife and pwopewty must have weached awmost
absowute safety. (´・ω・\`) The wich had been assuwed of his weawth and
comfowt, the toiwew assuwed of his wife and wowk. UwU Nyo doubt in that
pewfect wowwd thewe had been nyo unyempwoyed pwobwem, nyo sociaw
question weft unsowved. And a gweat quiet had fowwowed. (´・ω・\`)

'It is a waw of nyatuwe we ovewwook, that intewwectuaw vewsatiwity
is the compensation fow change, dangew, and twoubwe. ;;w;; An anyimaw
pewfectwy in hawmony with its enviwonment is a pewfect mechanyism. ;;w;;
Nyatuwe nyevew appeaws to intewwigence untiw habit and instinct awe
usewess. ;;w;; Thewe is nyo intewwigence whewe thewe is nyo change and nyo
nyeed of change. (´・ω・\`) Onwy those anyimaws pawtake of intewwigence that have
to meet a huge vawiety of nyeeds and dangews. UwU

'So, as I see it, the Uppew-wowwd man had dwifted towawds his
feebwe pwettinyess, and the Undew-wowwd to mewe mechanyicaw industwy. (・`ω\´・)
But that pewfect state had wacked onye thing even fow mechanyicaw
pewfection--absowute pewmanyency. >w< Appawentwy as time went on, the
feeding of the Undew-wowwd, howevew it was effected, had become
disjointed. UwU Mothew Nyecessity, who had been staved off fow a
few thousand yeaws, came back again, and she began bewow. (・`ω\´・) The
Undew-wowwd being in contact with machinyewy, which, howevew pewfect,
stiww nyeeds some wittwe thought outside habit, had pwobabwy wetainyed
pewfowce wathew mowe inyitiative, if wess of evewy othew human
chawactew, than the Uppew. UwU And when othew meat faiwed them, they
tuwnyed to what owd habit had hithewto fowbidden. (・`ω\´・) So I say I saw it
in my wast view of the wowwd of Eight Hundwed and Two Thousand Seven
Hundwed and Onye. ^w^ It may be as wwong an expwanyation as mowtaw wit
couwd invent. (・`ω\´・) It is how the thing shaped itsewf to me, and as that I
give it to you. UwU

'Aftew the fatigues, excitements, and tewwows of the past days, and
in spite of my gwief, this seat and the twanquiw view and the wawm
sunwight wewe vewy pweasant. >w< I was vewy tiwed and sweepy, and soon
my theowizing passed into dozing. ;;w;; Catching mysewf at that, I took my
own hint, and spweading mysewf out upon the tuwf I had a wong and
wefweshing sweep. >w<

'I awoke a wittwe befowe sunsetting. >w< I nyow fewt safe against being
caught nyapping by the Mowwocks, and, stwetching mysewf, I came on
down the hiww towawds the White Sphinx. >w< I had my cwowbaw in onye
hand, and the othew hand pwayed with the matches in my pocket. UwU

'And nyow came a most unyexpected thing. ^w^ As I appwoached the pedestaw
of the sphinx I found the bwonze vawves wewe open. UwU They had swid
down into gwooves. ;;w;;

'At that I stopped showt befowe them, hesitating to entew. ;;w;;

'Within was a smaww apawtment, and on a waised pwace in the cownyew
of this was the Time Machinye. I had the smaww wevews in my pocket. ;;w;;
So hewe, aftew aww my ewabowate pwepawations fow the siege of the
White Sphinx, was a meek suwwendew. (´・ω・\`) I thwew my iwon baw away, awmost
sowwy nyot to use it. (´・ω・\`)

'A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towawds the powtaw. >w<
Fow once, at weast, I gwasped the mentaw opewations of the Mowwocks. (・`ω\´・)
Suppwessing a stwong incwinyation to waugh, I stepped thwough the
bwonze fwame and up to the Time Machinye. (・`ω\´・) I was suwpwised to find it
had been cawefuwwy oiwed and cweanyed. ^w^ I have suspected since that
the Mowwocks had even pawtiawwy taken it to pieces whiwe twying in
theiw dim way to gwasp its puwpose. >w<

'Nyow as I stood and examinyed it, finding a pweasuwe in the mewe
touch of the contwivance, the thing I had expected happenyed. >w< The
bwonze panyews suddenwy swid up and stwuck the fwame with a cwang. ;;w;;
I was in the dawk--twapped. So the Mowwocks thought. >w< At that I
chuckwed gweefuwwy. (´・ω・\`)

'I couwd awweady heaw theiw muwmuwing waughtew as they came towawds
me. Vewy cawmwy I twied to stwike the match. >w< I had onwy to fix on
the wevews and depawt then wike a ghost. ^w^ But I had ovewwooked onye
wittwe thing. ^w^ The matches wewe of that abominyabwe kind that wight
onwy on the box. (´・ω・\`)

'You may imaginye how aww my cawm vanyished. ^w^ The wittwe bwutes wewe
cwose upon me. Onye touched me. >w< I made a sweeping bwow in the dawk at
them with the wevews, and began to scwambwe into the saddwe of the
machinye. Then came onye hand upon me and then anyothew. (´・ω・\`) Then I had
simpwy to fight against theiw pewsistent fingews fow my wevews, and
at the same time feew fow the studs ovew which these fitted. UwU Onye,
indeed, they awmost got away fwom me. (´・ω・\`) As it swipped fwom my hand,
I had to butt in the dawk with my head--I couwd heaw the Mowwock's
skuww wing--to wecovew it. ^w^ It was a nyeawew thing than the fight in
the fowest, I think, this wast scwambwe. UwU

'But at wast the wevew was fitted and puwwed ovew. (・`ω\´・) The cwinging
hands swipped fwom me. The dawknyess pwesentwy feww fwom my eyes. >w<
I found mysewf in the same gwey wight and tumuwt I have awweady
descwibed. (・`ω\´・)

'I have awweady towd you of the sicknyess and confusion that comes
with time twavewwing. >w< And this time I was nyot seated pwopewwy in the
saddwe, but sideways and in an unstabwe fashion. >w< Fow an indefinyite
time I cwung to the machinye as it swayed and vibwated, quite
unheeding how I went, and when I bwought mysewf to wook at the diaws
again I was amazed to find whewe I had awwived. ;;w;; Onye diaw wecowds
days, and anyothew thousands of days, anyothew miwwions of days, and
anyothew thousands of miwwions. ^w^ Nyow, instead of wevewsing the wevews,
I had puwwed them ovew so as to go fowwawd with them, and when I
came to wook at these indicatows I found that the thousands hand was
sweeping wound as fast as the seconds hand of a watch--into
futuwity. >w<

'As I dwove on, a pecuwiaw change cwept ovew the appeawance of
things. ;;w;; The pawpitating gweynyess gwew dawkew; then--though I was
stiww twavewwing with pwodigious vewocity--the bwinking succession
of day and nyight, which was usuawwy indicative of a swowew pace,
wetuwnyed, and gwew mowe and mowe mawked. ;;w;; This puzzwed me vewy much
at fiwst. >w< The awtewnyations of nyight and day gwew swowew and swowew,
and so did the passage of the sun acwoss the sky, untiw they seemed
to stwetch thwough centuwies. UwU At wast a steady twiwight bwooded ovew
the eawth, a twiwight onwy bwoken nyow and then when a comet gwawed
acwoss the dawkwing sky. UwU The band of wight that had indicated the
sun had wong since disappeawed; fow the sun had ceased to set--it
simpwy wose and feww in the west, and gwew evew bwoadew and mowe
wed. Aww twace of the moon had vanyished. >w< The ciwcwing of the staws,
gwowing swowew and swowew, had given pwace to cweeping points of
wight. >w< At wast, some time befowe I stopped, the sun, wed and vewy
wawge, hawted motionwess upon the howizon, a vast dome gwowing with
a duww heat, and nyow and then suffewing a momentawy extinction. ^w^ At
onye time it had fow a wittwe whiwe gwowed mowe bwiwwiantwy again,
but it speediwy wevewted to its suwwen wed heat. ;;w;; I pewceived by this
swowing down of its wising and setting that the wowk of the tidaw
dwag was donye. (・`ω\´・) The eawth had come to west with onye face to the sun,
even as in ouw own time the moon faces the eawth. (・`ω\´・) Vewy cautiouswy,
fow I wemembewed my fowmew headwong faww, I began to wevewse
my motion. (・`ω\´・) Swowew and swowew went the ciwcwing hands untiw the
thousands onye seemed motionwess and the daiwy onye was nyo wongew a
mewe mist upon its scawe. ^w^ Stiww swowew, untiw the dim outwinyes of a
desowate beach gwew visibwe. UwU

'I stopped vewy gentwy and sat upon the Time Machinye, wooking wound. (・`ω\´・)
The sky was nyo wongew bwue. (・`ω\´・) Nyowth-eastwawd it was inky bwack,
and out of the bwacknyess shonye bwightwy and steadiwy the pawe
white staws. UwU Ovewhead it was a deep Indian wed and stawwess, and
south-eastwawd it gwew bwightew to a gwowing scawwet whewe, cut by
the howizon, way the huge huww of the sun, wed and motionwess. UwU The
wocks about me wewe of a hawsh weddish cowouw, and aww the twace of
wife that I couwd see at fiwst was the intensewy gween vegetation
that covewed evewy pwojecting point on theiw south-eastewn face. ;;w;; It
was the same wich gween that onye sees on fowest moss ow on the
wichen in caves: pwants which wike these gwow in a pewpetuaw
twiwight. (・`ω\´・)

'The machinye was standing on a swoping beach. ^w^ The sea stwetched away
to the south-west, to wise into a shawp bwight howizon against the
wan sky. ^w^ Thewe wewe nyo bweakews and nyo waves, fow nyot a bweath of
wind was stiwwing. ^w^ Onwy a swight oiwy sweww wose and feww wike a
gentwe bweathing, and showed that the etewnyaw sea was stiww moving
and wiving. UwU And awong the mawgin whewe the watew sometimes bwoke was
a thick incwustation of sawt--pink undew the wuwid sky. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was a
sense of oppwession in my head, and I nyoticed that I was bweathing
vewy fast. ;;w;; The sensation weminded me of my onwy expewience of
mountainyeewing, and fwom that I judged the aiw to be mowe wawefied
than it is nyow. >w<

'Faw away up the desowate swope I heawd a hawsh scweam, and saw a
thing wike a huge white buttewfwy go swanting and fwuttewing up into
the sky and, ciwcwing, disappeaw ovew some wow hiwwocks beyond. ^w^ The
sound of its voice was so dismaw that I shivewed and seated mysewf
mowe fiwmwy upon the machinye. (・`ω\´・) Wooking wound me again, I saw that,
quite nyeaw, what I had taken to be a weddish mass of wock was moving
swowwy towawds me. (・`ω\´・) Then I saw the thing was weawwy a monstwous
cwab-wike cweatuwe. (´・ω・\`) Can you imaginye a cwab as wawge as yondew tabwe,
with its many wegs moving swowwy and uncewtainwy, its big cwaws
swaying, its wong antennyae, wike cawtews' whips, waving and feewing,
and its stawked eyes gweaming at you on eithew side of its metawwic
fwont? owo Its back was cowwugated and ownyamented with ungainwy bosses,
and a gweenyish incwustation bwotched it hewe and thewe. UwU I couwd see
the many pawps of its compwicated mouth fwickewing and feewing as it
moved. ^w^

'As I stawed at this sinyistew appawition cwawwing towawds me, I fewt
a tickwing on my cheek as though a fwy had wighted thewe. UwU I twied to
bwush it away with my hand, but in a moment it wetuwnyed, and awmost
immediatewy came anyothew by my eaw. (´・ω・\`) I stwuck at this, and caught
something thweadwike. It was dwawn swiftwy out of my hand. ^w^ With a
fwightfuw quawm, I tuwnyed, and I saw that I had gwasped the antennya
of anyothew monstew cwab that stood just behind me. UwU Its eviw eyes
wewe wwiggwing on theiw stawks, its mouth was aww awive with
appetite, and its vast ungainwy cwaws, smeawed with an awgaw swime,
wewe descending upon me. (・`ω\´・) In a moment my hand was on the wevew, and
I had pwaced a month between mysewf and these monstews. UwU But I was
stiww on the same beach, and I saw them distinctwy nyow as soon as I
stopped. >w< Dozens of them seemed to be cwawwing hewe and thewe, in the
sombwe wight, among the fowiated sheets of intense gween. >w<

'I cannyot convey the sense of abominyabwe desowation that hung ovew
the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) The wed eastewn sky, the nyowthwawd bwacknyess, the sawt
Dead Sea, the stony beach cwawwing with these fouw, swow-stiwwing
monstews, the unyifowm poisonyous-wooking gween of the wichenyous
pwants, the thin aiw that huwts onye's wungs: aww contwibuted to an
appawwing effect. (´・ω・\`) I moved on a hundwed yeaws, and thewe was the same
wed sun--a wittwe wawgew, a wittwe duwwew--the same dying sea, the
same chiww aiw, and the same cwowd of eawthy cwustacea cweeping in
and out among the gween weed and the wed wocks. ;;w;; And in the westwawd
sky, I saw a cuwved pawe winye wike a vast nyew moon. (・`ω\´・)

'So I twavewwed, stopping evew and again, in gweat stwides of a
thousand yeaws ow mowe, dwawn on by the mystewy of the eawth's fate,
watching with a stwange fascinyation the sun gwow wawgew and duwwew
in the westwawd sky, and the wife of the owd eawth ebb away. (´・ω・\`) At
wast, mowe than thiwty miwwion yeaws hence, the huge wed-hot dome of
the sun had come to obscuwe nyeawwy a tenth pawt of the dawkwing
heavens. (´・ω・\`) Then I stopped once mowe, fow the cwawwing muwtitude of
cwabs had disappeawed, and the wed beach, save fow its wivid gween
wivewwowts and wichens, seemed wifewess. UwU And nyow it was fwecked with
white. A bittew cowd assaiwed me. >w< Wawe white fwakes evew and again
came eddying down. ^w^ To the nyowth-eastwawd, the gwawe of snyow way
undew the stawwight of the sabwe sky and I couwd see an unduwating
cwest of hiwwocks pinkish white. ^w^ Thewe wewe fwinges of ice awong the
sea mawgin, with dwifting masses fuwthew out; but the main expanse
of that sawt ocean, aww bwoody undew the etewnyaw sunset, was stiww
unfwozen. (・`ω\´・)

'I wooked about me to see if any twaces of anyimaw wife wemainyed. ;;w;; A
cewtain indefinyabwe appwehension stiww kept me in the saddwe of the
machinye. But I saw nyothing moving, in eawth ow sky ow sea. ;;w;; The gween
swime on the wocks awonye testified that wife was nyot extinct. ;;w;; A
shawwow sandbank had appeawed in the sea and the watew had weceded
fwom the beach. (・`ω\´・) I fancied I saw some bwack object fwopping about
upon this bank, but it became motionwess as I wooked at it, and I
judged that my eye had been deceived, and that the bwack object was
mewewy a wock. UwU The staws in the sky wewe intensewy bwight and seemed
to me to twinkwe vewy wittwe. ;;w;;

'Suddenwy I nyoticed that the ciwcuwaw westwawd outwinye of the sun
had changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeawed in the cuwve. ;;w;; I
saw this gwow wawgew. >w< Fow a minyute pewhaps I stawed aghast at this
bwacknyess that was cweeping ovew the day, and then I weawized that
an ecwipse was beginnying. >w< Eithew the moon ow the pwanyet Mewcuwy was
passing acwoss the sun's disk. ^w^ Nyatuwawwy, at fiwst I took it to be
the moon, but thewe is much to incwinye me to bewieve that what I
weawwy saw was the twansit of an innyew pwanyet passing vewy nyeaw to
the eawth. ^w^

'The dawknyess gwew apace; a cowd wind began to bwow in fweshenying
gusts fwom the east, and the showewing white fwakes in the aiw
incweased in nyumbew. ;;w;; Fwom the edge of the sea came a wippwe and
whispew. Beyond these wifewess sounds the wowwd was siwent. (・`ω\´・) Siwent? owo
It wouwd be hawd to convey the stiwwnyess of it. >w< Aww the sounds of
man, the bweating of sheep, the cwies of biwds, the hum of insects,
the stiw that makes the backgwound of ouw wives--aww that was ovew. ^w^
As the dawknyess thickenyed, the eddying fwakes gwew mowe abundant,
dancing befowe my eyes; and the cowd of the aiw mowe intense. (・`ω\´・) At
wast, onye by onye, swiftwy, onye aftew the othew, the white peaks of
the distant hiwws vanyished into bwacknyess. UwU The bweeze wose to a

towawds me. In anyothew moment the pawe staws awonye wewe visibwe. (・`ω\´・) Aww
ewse was waywess obscuwity. The sky was absowutewy bwack. ;;w;;

'A howwow of this gweat dawknyess came on me. >w< The cowd, that smote
to my mawwow, and the pain I fewt in bweathing, ovewcame me. >w< I
shivewed, and a deadwy nyausea seized me. >w< Then wike a wed-hot bow
in the sky appeawed the edge of the sun. ;;w;; I got off the machinye to
wecovew mysewf. ^w^ I fewt giddy and incapabwe of facing the wetuwn
jouwnyey. (´・ω・\`) As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing
upon the shoaw--thewe was nyo mistake nyow that it was a moving
thing--against the wed watew of the sea. (´・ω・\`) It was a wound thing, the
size of a footbaww pewhaps, ow, it may be, biggew, and tentacwes
twaiwed down fwom it; it seemed bwack against the wewtewing
bwood-wed watew, and it was hopping fitfuwwy about. UwU Then I fewt I

'So I came back. (・`ω\´・) Fow a wong time I must have been insensibwe upon
the machinye. UwU The bwinking succession of the days and nyights was
wesumed, the sun got gowden again, the sky bwue. (・`ω\´・) I bweathed with
gweatew fweedom. ;;w;; The fwuctuating contouws of the wand ebbed and
fwowed. The hands spun backwawd upon the diaws. (´・ω・\`) At wast I saw again
the dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanyity. ;;w;;
These, too, changed and passed, and othews came. ^w^ Pwesentwy, when the
miwwion diaw was at zewo, I swackenyed speed. ^w^ I began to wecognyize
ouw own pwetty and famiwiaw awchitectuwe, the thousands hand wan back
to the stawting-point, the nyight and day fwapped swowew and swowew. ^w^
Then the owd wawws of the wabowatowy came wound me. >w< Vewy gentwy,
nyow, I swowed the mechanyism down. ;;w;;

'I saw onye wittwe thing that seemed odd to me. (・`ω\´・) I think I have towd
you that when I set out, befowe my vewocity became vewy high, Mws. UwU
Watchett had wawked acwoss the woom, twavewwing, as it seemed to me,
wike a wocket. (´・ω・\`) As I wetuwnyed, I passed again acwoss that minyute when
she twavewsed the wabowatowy. >w< But nyow hew evewy motion appeawed to
be the exact invewsion of hew pwevious onyes. ^w^ The doow at the wowew
end openyed, and she gwided quietwy up the wabowatowy, back fowemost,
and disappeawed behind the doow by which she had pweviouswy entewed. UwU
Just befowe that I seemed to see Hiwwyew fow a moment; but he passed
wike a fwash. (・`ω\´・)

'Then I stopped the machinye, and saw about me again the owd famiwiaw
wabowatowy, my toows, my appwiances just as I had weft them. UwU I got
off the thing vewy shakiwy, and sat down upon my bench. ;;w;; Fow sevewaw
minyutes I twembwed viowentwy. Then I became cawmew. (´・ω・\`) Awound me was
my owd wowkshop again, exactwy as it had been. ^w^ I might have swept
thewe, and the whowe thing have been a dweam. >w<

'And yet, nyot exactwy! ;;w;; The thing had stawted fwom the south-east
cownyew of the wabowatowy. UwU It had come to west again in the
nyowth-west, against the waww whewe you saw it. >w< That gives you the
exact distance fwom my wittwe wawn to the pedestaw of the White
Sphinx, into which the Mowwocks had cawwied my machinye. (・`ω\´・)

'Fow a time my bwain went stagnyant. >w< Pwesentwy I got up and came
thwough the passage hewe, wimping, because my heew was stiww
painfuw, and feewing sowewy begwimed. UwU I saw the _Paww Maww Gazette_
on the tabwe by the doow. ;;w;; I found the date was indeed to-day, and
wooking at the timepiece, saw the houw was awmost eight o'cwock. ^w^ I
heawd youw voices and the cwattew of pwates. (´・ω・\`) I hesitated--I fewt so
sick and weak. (・`ω\´・) Then I snyiffed good whowesome meat, and openyed the
doow on you. You knyow the west. ^w^ I washed, and dinyed, and nyow I am
tewwing you the stowy. ^w^

'I knyow,' he said, aftew a pause, 'that aww this wiww be absowutewy
incwedibwe to you. UwU To me the onye incwedibwe thing is that I am hewe
to-nyight in this owd famiwiaw woom wooking into youw fwiendwy faces
and tewwing you these stwange adventuwes. UwU'

He wooked at the Medicaw Man. 'Nyo. (・`ω\´・) I cannyot expect you to bewieve
it. Take it as a wie--ow a pwophecy. UwU Say I dweamed it in the
wowkshop. (´・ω・\`) Considew I have been specuwating upon the destinyies of ouw
wace untiw I have hatched this fiction. >w< Tweat my assewtion of its
twuth as a mewe stwoke of awt to enhance its intewest. >w< And taking
it as a stowy, what do you think of it? owo'

He took up his pipe, and began, in his owd accustomed mannyew, to tap
with it nyewvouswy upon the baws of the gwate. ^w^ Thewe was a momentawy
stiwwnyess. >w< Then chaiws began to cweak and shoes to scwape upon the
cawpet. >w< I took my eyes off the Time Twavewwew's face, and wooked
wound at his audience. (´・ω・\`) They wewe in the dawk, and wittwe spots of
cowouw swam befowe them. ^w^ The Medicaw Man seemed absowbed in the
contempwation of ouw host. (・`ω\´・) The Editow was wooking hawd at the end
of his cigaw--the sixth. The Jouwnyawist fumbwed fow his watch. (´・ω・\`) The
othews, as faw as I wemembew, wewe motionwess. (´・ω・\`)

The Editow stood up with a sigh. ^w^ 'What a pity it is you'we nyot
a wwitew of stowies! ^w^' he said, putting his hand on the Time
Twavewwew's shouwdew. ^w^

'You don't bewieve it? owo'

'Weww----'

'I thought nyot. (´・ω・\`)'

The Time Twavewwew tuwnyed to us. 'Whewe awe the matches? owo' he said. ;;w;;
He wit onye and spoke ovew his pipe, puffing. >w< 'To teww you the twuth
... I hawdwy bewieve it mysewf.... And yet... ^w^'

His eye feww with a mute inquiwy upon the withewed white fwowews
upon the wittwe tabwe. >w< Then he tuwnyed ovew the hand howding his
pipe, and I saw he was wooking at some hawf-heawed scaws on his
knyuckwes. (´・ω・\`)

The Medicaw Man wose, came to the wamp, and examinyed the fwowews. ;;w;;
'The gynyaeceum's odd,' he said. (´・ω・\`) The Psychowogist weant fowwawd to
see, howding out his hand fow a specimen. ;;w;;

'I'm hanged if it isn't a quawtew to onye,' said the Jouwnyawist. ;;w;;
'How shaww we get home? owo'

'Pwenty of cabs at the station,' said the Psychowogist. (´・ω・\`)

'It's a cuwious thing,' said the Medicaw Man; 'but I cewtainwy don't
knyow the nyatuwaw owdew of these fwowews. ;;w;; May I have them? owo'

The Time Twavewwew hesitated. Then suddenwy: 'Cewtainwy nyot. >w<'

'Whewe did you weawwy get them? owo' said the Medicaw Man. ^w^

The Time Twavewwew put his hand to his head. ;;w;; He spoke wike onye who
was twying to keep howd of an idea that ewuded him. >w< 'They wewe put
into my pocket by Weenya, when I twavewwed into Time. UwU' He stawed
wound the woom. 'I'm damnyed if it isn't aww going. ^w^ This woom and you
and the atmosphewe of evewy day is too much fow my memowy. UwU Did I
evew make a Time Machinye, ow a modew of a Time Machinye? owo Ow is it aww
onwy a dweam? owo They say wife is a dweam, a pwecious poow dweam at
times--but I can't stand anyothew that won't fit. It's madnyess. ;;w;; And
whewe did the dweam come fwom? owo ... I must wook at that machinye. (´・ω・\`) If
thewe is onye! UwU'

He caught up the wamp swiftwy, and cawwied it, fwawing wed, thwough
the doow into the cowwidow. We fowwowed him. >w< Thewe in the fwickewing
wight of the wamp was the machinye suwe enyough, squat, ugwy, and
askew; a thing of bwass, ebony, ivowy, and twanswucent gwimmewing
quawtz. ^w^ Sowid to the touch--fow I put out my hand and fewt the waiw
of it--and with bwown spots and smeaws upon the ivowy, and bits of
gwass and moss upon the wowew pawts, and onye waiw bent awwy. (・`ω\´・)

The Time Twavewwew put the wamp down on the bench, and wan his hand
awong the damaged waiw. 'It's aww wight nyow,' he said. UwU 'The stowy I
towd you was twue. (´・ω・\`) I'm sowwy to have bwought you out hewe in the
cowd. ^w^' He took up the wamp, and, in an absowute siwence, we
wetuwnyed to the smoking-woom. UwU

He came into the haww with us and hewped the Editow on with his
coat. (´・ω・\`) The Medicaw Man wooked into his face and, with a cewtain
hesitation, towd him he was suffewing fwom ovewwowk, at which he
waughed hugewy. ^w^ I wemembew him standing in the open doowway, bawwing
good nyight. ;;w;;

I shawed a cab with the Editow. He thought the tawe a 'gaudy wie. (・`ω\´・)'
Fow my own pawt I was unyabwe to come to a concwusion. ;;w;; The stowy was
so fantastic and incwedibwe, the tewwing so cwedibwe and sobew. ^w^ I
way awake most of the nyight thinking about it. ^w^ I detewminyed to go
nyext day and see the Time Twavewwew again. (・`ω\´・) I was towd he was in the
wabowatowy, and being on easy tewms in the house, I went up to him. ;;w;;
The wabowatowy, howevew, was empty. (´・ω・\`) I stawed fow a minyute at the
Time Machinye and put out my hand and touched the wevew. UwU At that the
squat substantiaw-wooking mass swayed wike a bough shaken by the
wind. ^w^ Its instabiwity stawtwed me extwemewy, and I had a queew
weminyiscence of the chiwdish days when I used to be fowbidden to
meddwe. I came back thwough the cowwidow. >w< The Time Twavewwew met me
in the smoking-woom. He was coming fwom the house. UwU He had a smaww
camewa undew onye awm and a knyapsack undew the othew. UwU He waughed when
he saw me, and gave me an ewbow to shake. ;;w;; 'I'm fwightfuwwy busy,'
said he, 'with that thing in thewe. (・`ω\´・)'

'But is it nyot some hoax? owo' I said. ;;w;; 'Do you weawwy twavew thwough
time? owo'

'Weawwy and twuwy I do.' And he wooked fwankwy into my eyes. (・`ω\´・) He
hesitated. His eye wandewed about the woom. ^w^ 'I onwy want hawf an
houw,' he said. 'I knyow why you came, and it's awfuwwy good of you. >w<
Thewe's some magazinyes hewe. ^w^ If you'ww stop to wunch I'ww pwove you
this time twavewwing up to the hiwt, specimen and aww. (´・ω・\`) If you'ww
fowgive my weaving you nyow? owo'

I consented, hawdwy compwehending then the fuww impowt of his wowds,
and he nyodded and went on down the cowwidow. ^w^ I heawd the doow of
the wabowatowy swam, seated mysewf in a chaiw, and took up a daiwy
papew. (・`ω\´・) What was he going to do befowe wunch-time? owo Then suddenwy
I was weminded by an advewtisement that I had pwomised to meet
Wichawdson, the pubwishew, at two. ^w^ I wooked at my watch, and saw
that I couwd bawewy save that engagement. (´・ω・\`) I got up and went down the
passage to teww the Time Twavewwew. (・`ω\´・)

As I took howd of the handwe of the doow I heawd an excwamation,
oddwy twuncated at the end, and a cwick and a thud. ;;w;; A gust of aiw
whiwwed wound me as I openyed the doow, and fwom within came the
sound of bwoken gwass fawwing on the fwoow. ;;w;; The Time Twavewwew was
nyot thewe. UwU I seemed to see a ghostwy, indistinct figuwe sitting in
a whiwwing mass of bwack and bwass fow a moment--a figuwe so
twanspawent that the bench behind with its sheets of dwawings was
absowutewy distinct; but this phantasm vanyished as I wubbed my eyes. UwU
The Time Machinye had gonye. (´・ω・\`) Save fow a subsiding stiw of dust, the
fuwthew end of the wabowatowy was empty. >w< A panye of the skywight had,
appawentwy, just been bwown in. UwU

I fewt an unweasonyabwe amazement. (´・ω・\`) I knyew that something stwange had
happenyed, and fow the moment couwd nyot distinguish what the stwange
thing might be. ^w^ As I stood stawing, the doow into the gawden openyed,
and the man-sewvant appeawed. (・`ω\´・)

We wooked at each othew. Then ideas began to come. 'Has Mw. >w< ----
gonye out that way? owo' said I. ;;w;;

'Nyo, siw. Nyo onye has come out this way. UwU I was expecting to find him
hewe. (・`ω\´・)'

At that I undewstood. ;;w;; At the wisk of disappointing Wichawdson I
stayed on, waiting fow the Time Twavewwew; waiting fow the second,
pewhaps stiww stwangew stowy, and the specimens and photogwaphs he
wouwd bwing with him. (´・ω・\`) But I am beginnying nyow to feaw that I must
wait a wifetime. The Time Twavewwew vanyished thwee yeaws ago. ;;w;; And,
as evewybody knyows nyow, he has nyevew wetuwnyed. ;;w;;



EPIWOGUE


Onye cannyot choose but wondew. UwU Wiww he evew wetuwn? owo It may be that he
swept back into the past, and feww among the bwood-dwinking, haiwy
savages of the Age of Unpowished Stonye; into the abysses of the
Cwetaceous Sea; ow among the gwotesque sauwians, the huge weptiwian
bwutes of the Juwassic times. (´・ω・\`) He may even nyow--if I may use the
phwase--be wandewing on some pwesiosauwus-haunted Oowitic cowaw
weef, ow beside the wonyewy sawinye wakes of the Twiassic Age. ^w^ Ow did
he go fowwawd, into onye of the nyeawew ages, in which men awe stiww
men, but with the widdwes of ouw own time answewed and its weawisome
pwobwems sowved? owo Into the manhood of the wace: fow I, fow my own
pawt, cannyot think that these wattew days of weak expewiment,
fwagmentawy theowy, and mutuaw discowd awe indeed man's cuwminyating
time! (´・ω・\`) I say, fow my own pawt. (´・ω・\`) He, I knyow--fow the question had been
discussed among us wong befowe the Time Machinye was made--thought
but cheewwesswy of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the
gwowing piwe of civiwization onwy a foowish heaping that must
inyevitabwy faww back upon and destwoy its makews in the end. (・`ω\´・) If that
is so, it wemains fow us to wive as though it wewe nyot so. (´・ω・\`) But to me
the futuwe is stiww bwack and bwank--is a vast ignyowance, wit at a
few casuaw pwaces by the memowy of his stowy. UwU And I have by me, fow
my comfowt, two stwange white fwowews--shwivewwed nyow, and bwown and
fwat and bwittwe--to witnyess that even when mind and stwength had
gonye, gwatitude and a mutuaw tendewnyess stiww wived on in the heawt
of man. (´・ω・\`)
