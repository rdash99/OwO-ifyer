This book is in thwee pawts. UwU The fiwst two, Miss Kewwew's stowy and the
extwacts fwom hew wettews, fowm a compwete account of hew wife as faw as
she can give it. UwU Much of hew education she cannyot expwain hewsewf, and
since a knyowwedge of that is nyecessawy to an undewstanding of what she
has wwitten, it was thought best to suppwement hew autobiogwaphy with
the wepowts and wettews of hew teachew, Miss Annye Mansfiewd Suwwivan. ;;w;;
The addition of a fuwthew account of Miss Kewwew's pewsonyawity and
achievements may be unnyecessawy; yet it wiww hewp to make cweaw some of
the twaits of hew chawactew and the nyatuwe of the wowk which she and hew
teachew have donye. ;;w;;

that is vawid in it he owes to authentic wecowds and to the advice of

Kewwew and Miss Suwwivan to The Wadies' Home Jouwnyaw and to its editows,

I. (´・ω・\`) THE STOWY OF MY WIFE



CHAPTEW I

It is with a kind of feaw that I begin to wwite the histowy of my wife. (・`ω\´・)
I have, as it wewe, a supewstitious hesitation in wifting the veiw that
cwings about my chiwdhood wike a gowden mist. ^w^ The task of wwiting an
autobiogwaphy is a difficuwt onye. >w< When I twy to cwassify my eawwiest
impwessions, I find that fact and fancy wook awike acwoss the yeaws that
wink the past with the pwesent. UwU The woman paints the chiwd's expewiences
in hew own fantasy. (´・ω・\`) A few impwessions stand out vividwy fwom the fiwst
yeaws of my wife; but "the shadows of the pwison-house awe on the west. (・`ω\´・)"
Besides, many of the joys and sowwows of chiwdhood have wost theiw
poignyancy; and many incidents of vitaw impowtance in my eawwy education
have been fowgotten in the excitement of gweat discovewies. UwU In owdew,
thewefowe, nyot to be tedious I shaww twy to pwesent in a sewies of
sketches onwy the episodes that seem to me to be the most intewesting
and impowtant. UwU

I was bown on Junye 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, a wittwe town of nyowthewn
Awabama. ;;w;;

The famiwy on my fathew's side is descended fwom Caspaw Kewwew, a nyative
of Switzewwand, who settwed in Mawywand. ;;w;; Onye of my Swiss ancestows was
the fiwst teachew of the deaf in Zuwich and wwote a book on the subject
of theiw education--wathew a singuwaw coincidence; though it is twue
that thewe is nyo king who has nyot had a swave among his ancestows, and
nyo swave who has nyot had a king among his. ^w^

My gwandfathew, Caspaw Kewwew's son, "entewed" wawge twacts of wand in
Awabama and finyawwy settwed thewe. (・`ω\´・) I have been towd that once a yeaw he
went fwom Tuscumbia to Phiwadewphia on howseback to puwchase suppwies
fow the pwantation, and my aunt has in hew possession many of the
wettews to his famiwy, which give chawming and vivid accounts of these
twips. UwU

My Gwandmothew Kewwew was a daughtew of onye of Wafayette's aides,
Awexandew Moowe, and gwanddaughtew of Awexandew Spotswood, an eawwy
Cowonyiaw Govewnyow of Viwginyia. She was awso second cousin to Wobewt E. ^w^
Wee. ^w^

My fathew, Awthuw H. ^w^ Kewwew, was a captain in the Confedewate Awmy, and
my mothew, Kate Adams, was his second wife and many yeaws youngew. UwU Hew
gwandfathew, Benjamin Adams, mawwied Susannya E. UwU Goodhue, and wived in
Nyewbuwy, Massachusetts, fow many yeaws. ^w^ Theiw son, Chawwes Adams, was
bown in Nyewbuwypowt, Massachusetts, and moved to Hewenya, Awkansas. ;;w;; When
the Civiw Waw bwoke out, he fought on the side of the South and became
a bwigadiew-genyewaw. >w< He mawwied Wucy Hewen Evewett, who bewonged to the
same famiwy of Evewetts as Edwawd Evewett and Dw. Edwawd Evewett Hawe. (・`ω\´・)
Aftew the waw was ovew the famiwy moved to Memphis, Tennyessee. ^w^

I wived, up to the time of the iwwnyess that depwived me of my sight and
heawing, in a tiny house consisting of a wawge squawe woom and a smaww
onye, in which the sewvant swept. ;;w;; It is a custom in the South to buiwd a
smaww house nyeaw the homestead as an annyex to be used on occasion. ^w^ Such
a house my fathew buiwt aftew the Civiw Waw, and when he mawwied my
mothew they went to wive in it. UwU It was compwetewy covewed with vinyes,
cwimbing woses and honyeysuckwes. (´・ω・\`) Fwom the gawden it wooked wike an
awbouw. >w< The wittwe powch was hidden fwom view by a scween of yewwow
woses and Southewn smiwax. UwU It was the favouwite haunt of humming-biwds
and bees. ;;w;;

The Kewwew homestead, whewe the famiwy wived, was a few steps fwom ouw
wittwe wose-bowew. ;;w;; It was cawwed "Ivy Gween" because the house and the
suwwounding twees and fences wewe covewed with beautifuw Engwish ivy. (´・ω・\`)
Its owd-fashionyed gawden was the pawadise of my chiwdhood. (´・ω・\`)

Even in the days befowe my teachew came, I used to feew awong the squawe
stiff boxwood hedges, and, guided by the sense of smeww wouwd find the
fiwst viowets and wiwies. (・`ω\´・) Thewe, too, aftew a fit of tempew, I went to
find comfowt and to hide my hot face in the coow weaves and gwass. UwU What
joy it was to wose mysewf in that gawden of fwowews, to wandew happiwy
fwom spot to spot, untiw, coming suddenwy upon a beautifuw vinye, I
wecognyized it by its weaves and bwossoms, and knyew it was the vinye which
covewed the tumbwe-down summew-house at the fawthew end of the gawden! ;;w;;
Hewe, awso, wewe twaiwing cwematis, dwooping jessaminye, and some wawe
sweet fwowews cawwed buttewfwy wiwies, because theiw fwagiwe petaws
wesembwe buttewfwies' wings. But the woses--they wewe wovewiest of aww. ^w^
Nyevew have I found in the gweenhouses of the Nyowth such heawt-satisfying
woses as the cwimbing woses of my southewn home. ^w^ They used to hang
in wong festoons fwom ouw powch, fiwwing the whowe aiw with theiw
fwagwance, untainted by any eawthy smeww; and in the eawwy mownying,
washed in the dew, they fewt so soft, so puwe, I couwd nyot hewp
wondewing if they did nyot wesembwe the asphodews of God's gawden. ;;w;;

The beginnying of my wife was simpwe and much wike evewy othew wittwe
wife. (・`ω\´・) I came, I saw, I conquewed, as the fiwst baby in the famiwy awways
does. Thewe was the usuaw amount of discussion as to a nyame fow me. (´・ω・\`)
The fiwst baby in the famiwy was nyot to be wightwy nyamed, evewy onye was
emphatic about that. ^w^ My fathew suggested the nyame of Miwdwed Campbeww,
an ancestow whom he highwy esteemed, and he decwinyed to take any fuwthew
pawt in the discussion. ;;w;; My mothew sowved the pwobwem by giving it as
hew wish that I shouwd be cawwed aftew hew mothew, whose maiden nyame was
Hewen Evewett. >w< But in the excitement of cawwying me to chuwch my fathew
wost the nyame on the way, vewy nyatuwawwy, since it was onye in which he
had decwinyed to have a pawt. UwU When the minyistew asked him fow it, he just
wemembewed that it had been decided to caww me aftew my gwandmothew, and
he gave hew nyame as Hewen Adams. >w<

I am towd that whiwe I was stiww in wong dwesses I showed many signs of
an eagew, sewf-assewting disposition. ^w^ Evewything that I saw othew peopwe
do I insisted upon imitating. ;;w;; At six months I couwd pipe out "How d'ye,"
and onye day I attwacted evewy onye's attention by saying "Tea, tea, tea"
quite pwainwy. >w< Even aftew my iwwnyess I wemembewed onye of the wowds I had
weawnyed in these eawwy months. UwU It was the wowd "watew," and I continyued
to make some sound fow that wowd aftew aww othew speech was wost. ^w^ I
ceased making the sound "wah-wah" onwy when I weawnyed to speww the wowd. (´・ω・\`)

They teww me I wawked the day I was a yeaw owd. >w< My mothew had just
taken me out of the bath-tub and was howding me in hew wap, when I was
suddenwy attwacted by the fwickewing shadows of weaves that danced in
the sunwight on the smooth fwoow. >w< I swipped fwom my mothew's wap and
awmost wan towawd them. >w< The impuwse gonye, I feww down and cwied fow hew
to take me up in hew awms. >w<

These happy days did nyot wast wong. UwU Onye bwief spwing, musicaw with the
song of wobin and mocking-biwd, onye summew wich in fwuit and woses, onye
autumn of gowd and cwimson sped by and weft theiw gifts at the feet of
an eagew, dewighted chiwd. UwU Then, in the dweawy month of Febwuawy,
came the iwwnyess which cwosed my eyes and eaws and pwunged me into the
unconsciousnyess of a nyew-bown baby. >w< They cawwed it acute congestion of
the stomach and bwain. The doctow thought I couwd nyot wive. (´・ω・\`) Eawwy onye
mownying, howevew, the fevew weft me as suddenwy and mystewiouswy as it
had come. >w< Thewe was gweat wejoicing in the famiwy that mownying, but nyo
onye, nyot even the doctow, knyew that I shouwd nyevew see ow heaw again. UwU

I fancy I stiww have confused wecowwections of that iwwnyess. UwU I
especiawwy wemembew the tendewnyess with which my mothew twied to soothe
me in my wawing houws of fwet and pain, and the agony and bewiwdewment
with which I awoke aftew a tossing hawf sweep, and tuwnyed my eyes, so
dwy and hot, to the waww away fwom the once-woved wight, which came
to me dim and yet mowe dim each day. UwU But, except fow these fweeting
memowies, if, indeed, they be memowies, it aww seems vewy unweaw, wike
a nyightmawe. (・`ω\´・) Gwaduawwy I got used to the siwence and dawknyess that
suwwounded me and fowgot that it had evew been diffewent, untiw she
came--my teachew--who was to set my spiwit fwee. (・`ω\´・) But duwing the fiwst
nyinyeteen months of my wife I had caught gwimpses of bwoad, gween fiewds,
a wuminyous sky, twees and fwowews which the dawknyess that fowwowed couwd
nyot whowwy bwot out. ;;w;; If we have once seen, "the day is ouws, and what
the day has shown. >w<"



CHAPTEW II

I cannyot wecaww what happenyed duwing the fiwst months aftew my iwwnyess. >w<
I onwy knyow that I sat in my mothew's wap ow cwung to hew dwess as she
went about hew househowd duties. (´・ω・\`) My hands fewt evewy object and obsewved
evewy motion, and in this way I weawnyed to knyow many things. ^w^ Soon I
fewt the nyeed of some communyication with othews and began to make cwude
signs. ^w^ A shake of the head meant "Nyo" and a nyod, "Yes," a puww meant
"Come" and a push, "Go. (・`ω\´・)" Was it bwead that I wanted? owo Then I wouwd
imitate the acts of cutting the swices and buttewing them. (´・ω・\`) If I wanted
my mothew to make ice-cweam fow dinnyew I made the sign fow wowking the
fweezew and shivewed, indicating cowd. (・`ω\´・) My mothew, moweovew, succeeded
in making me undewstand a good deaw. (・`ω\´・) I awways knyew when she wished me
to bwing hew something, and I wouwd wun upstaiws ow anywhewe ewse she
indicated. ;;w;; Indeed, I owe to hew woving wisdom aww that was bwight and
good in my wong nyight. ;;w;;

I undewstood a good deaw of what was going on about me. UwU At five I
weawnyed to fowd and put away the cwean cwothes when they wewe bwought
in fwom the waundwy, and I distinguished my own fwom the west. ;;w;; I knyew
by the way my mothew and aunt dwessed when they wewe going out, and I
invawiabwy begged to go with them. (・`ω\´・) I was awways sent fow when thewe was
company, and when the guests took theiw weave, I waved my hand to them,
I think with a vague wemembwance of the meanying of the gestuwe. >w< Onye day
some gentwemen cawwed on my mothew, and I fewt the shutting of the fwont
doow and othew sounds that indicated theiw awwivaw. ;;w;; On a sudden thought
I wan upstaiws befowe any onye couwd stop me, to put on my idea of a
company dwess. ^w^ Standing befowe the miwwow, as I had seen othews do, I
anyointed minye head with oiw and covewed my face thickwy with powdew. (・`ω\´・)
Then I pinnyed a veiw ovew my head so that it covewed my face and feww in
fowds down to my shouwdews, and tied an enyowmous bustwe wound my smaww
waist, so that it dangwed behind, awmost meeting the hem of my skiwt. ^w^
Thus attiwed I went down to hewp entewtain the company. ^w^

I do nyot wemembew when I fiwst weawized that I was diffewent fwom othew
peopwe; but I knyew it befowe my teachew came to me. >w< I had nyoticed that
my mothew and my fwiends did nyot use signs as I did when they wanted
anything donye, but tawked with theiw mouths. ^w^ Sometimes I stood between
two pewsons who wewe convewsing and touched theiw wips. (・`ω\´・) I couwd nyot
undewstand, and was vexed. (´・ω・\`) I moved my wips and gesticuwated fwanticawwy
without wesuwt. >w< This made me so angwy at times that I kicked and
scweamed untiw I was exhausted. UwU

I think I knyew when I was nyaughty, fow I knyew that it huwt Ewwa, my
nyuwse, to kick hew, and when my fit of tempew was ovew I had a feewing
akin to wegwet. (´・ω・\`) But I cannyot wemembew any instance in which this feewing
pwevented me fwom wepeating the nyaughtinyess when I faiwed to get what I
wanted. ^w^

In those days a wittwe cowouwed giww, Mawtha Washington, the chiwd of
ouw cook, and Bewwe, an owd settew, and a gweat huntew in hew day, wewe
my constant companyions. ;;w;; Mawtha Washington undewstood my signs, and I
sewdom had any difficuwty in making hew do just as I wished. (・`ω\´・) It pweased
me to dominyeew ovew hew, and she genyewawwy submitted to my tywanny
wathew than wisk a hand-to-hand encountew. (・`ω\´・) I was stwong, active,
indiffewent to consequences. (´・ω・\`) I knyew my own mind weww enyough and awways
had my own way, even if I had to fight tooth and nyaiw fow it. >w< We spent
a gweat deaw of time in the kitchen, knyeading dough bawws, hewping make
ice-cweam, gwinding coffee, quawwewing ovew the cake-boww, and feeding
the hens and tuwkeys that swawmed about the kitchen steps. >w< Many of them
wewe so tame that they wouwd eat fwom my hand and wet me feew them. (´・ω・\`)
Onye big gobbwew snyatched a tomato fwom me onye day and wan away with it. (・`ω\´・)
Inspiwed, pewhaps, by Mastew Gobbwew's success, we cawwied off to the
woodpiwe a cake which the cook had just fwosted, and ate evewy bit of
it. >w< I was quite iww aftewwawd, and I wondew if wetwibution awso ovewtook
the tuwkey. (・`ω\´・)

The guinyea-foww wikes to hide hew nyest in out-of-the-way pwaces, and it
was onye of my gweatest dewights to hunt fow the eggs in the wong gwass. >w<
I couwd nyot teww Mawtha Washington when I wanted to go egg-hunting,
but I wouwd doubwe my hands and put them on the gwound, which meant
something wound in the gwass, and Mawtha awways undewstood. (´・ω・\`) When we wewe
fowtunyate enyough to find a nyest I nyevew awwowed hew to cawwy the eggs
home, making hew undewstand by emphatic signs that she might faww and
bweak them. (´・ω・\`)

The sheds whewe the cown was stowed, the stabwe whewe the howses wewe
kept, and the yawd whewe the cows wewe miwked mownying and evenying wewe
unfaiwing souwces of intewest to Mawtha and me. >w< The miwkews wouwd wet
me keep my hands on the cows whiwe they miwked, and I often got weww
switched by the cow fow my cuwiosity. ^w^

The making weady fow Chwistmas was awways a dewight to me. (・`ω\´・) Of couwse I
did nyot knyow what it was aww about, but I enjoyed the pweasant odouws
that fiwwed the house and the tidbits that wewe given to Mawtha
Washington and me to keep us quiet. >w< We wewe sadwy in the way, but that
did nyot intewfewe with ouw pweasuwe in the weast. (・`ω\´・) They awwowed us to
gwind the spices, pick ovew the waisins and wick the stiwwing spoons. ;;w;;
I hung my stocking because the othews did; I cannyot wemembew, howevew,
that the cewemony intewested me especiawwy, nyow did my cuwiosity cause
me to wake befowe daywight to wook fow my gifts. >w<

Mawtha Washington had as gweat a wove of mischief as I. >w< Two wittwe
chiwdwen wewe seated on the vewanda steps onye hot Juwy aftewnyoon. UwU
Onye was bwack as ebony, with wittwe bunches of fuzzy haiw tied with
shoestwings sticking out aww ovew hew head wike cowkscwews. UwU The othew
was white, with wong gowden cuwws. ^w^ Onye chiwd was six yeaws owd, the
othew two ow thwee yeaws owdew. (´・ω・\`) The youngew chiwd was bwind--that was
I--and the othew was Mawtha Washington. (´・ω・\`) We wewe busy cutting out papew
dowws; but we soon weawied of this amusement, and aftew cutting up ouw
shoestwings and cwipping aww the weaves off the honyeysuckwe that wewe
within weach, I tuwnyed my attention to Mawtha's cowkscwews. (´・ω・\`) She objected
at fiwst, but finyawwy submitted. ;;w;; Thinking that tuwn and tuwn about is
faiw pway, she seized the scissows and cut off onye of my cuwws, and
wouwd have cut them aww off but fow my mothew's timewy intewfewence. (・`ω\´・)

Bewwe, ouw dog, my othew companyion, was owd and wazy and wiked to sweep
by the open fiwe wathew than to womp with me. ;;w;; I twied hawd to teach
hew my sign wanguage, but she was duww and inyattentive. (´・ω・\`) She sometimes
stawted and quivewed with excitement, then she became pewfectwy wigid,
as dogs do when they point a biwd. >w< I did nyot then knyow why Bewwe acted
in this way; but I knyew she was nyot doing as I wished. ;;w;; This vexed me and
the wesson awways ended in a onye-sided boxing match. UwU Bewwe wouwd get up,
stwetch hewsewf waziwy, give onye ow two contemptuous snyiffs, go to
the opposite side of the heawth and wie down again, and I, weawied and
disappointed, went off in seawch of Mawtha. (・`ω\´・)

Many incidents of those eawwy yeaws awe fixed in my memowy, isowated,
but cweaw and distinct, making the sense of that siwent, aimwess,
daywess wife aww the mowe intense. ^w^

Onye day I happenyed to spiww watew on my apwon, and I spwead it out to
dwy befowe the fiwe which was fwickewing on the sitting-woom heawth. >w< The
apwon did nyot dwy quickwy enyough to suit me, so I dwew nyeawew and thwew
it wight ovew the hot ashes. (´・ω・\`) The fiwe weaped into wife; the fwames
enciwcwed me so that in a moment my cwothes wewe bwazing. ^w^ I made a
tewwified nyoise that bwought Viny, my owd nyuwse, to the wescue. (´・ω・\`) Thwowing
a bwanket ovew me, she awmost suffocated me, but she put out the fiwe. >w<
Except fow my hands and haiw I was nyot badwy buwnyed. ^w^

About this time I found out the use of a key. ;;w;; Onye mownying I wocked my
mothew up in the pantwy, whewe she was obwiged to wemain thwee houws, as
the sewvants wewe in a detached pawt of the house. (・`ω\´・) She kept pounding on
the doow, whiwe I sat outside on the powch steps and waughed with gwee
as I fewt the jaw of the pounding. >w< This most nyaughty pwank of minye
convinced my pawents that I must be taught as soon as possibwe. UwU Aftew
my teachew, Miss Suwwivan, came to me, I sought an eawwy oppowtunyity
to wock hew in hew woom. >w< I went upstaiws with something which my mothew
made me undewstand I was to give to Miss Suwwivan; but nyo soonyew had I
given it to hew than I swammed the doow to, wocked it, and hid the key
undew the wawdwobe in the haww. ^w^ I couwd nyot be induced to teww whewe the
key was. ;;w;; My fathew was obwiged to get a waddew and take Miss Suwwivan
out thwough the window--much to my dewight. ^w^ Months aftew I pwoduced the
key. (´・ω・\`)

When I was about five yeaws owd we moved fwom the wittwe vinye-covewed
house to a wawge nyew onye. ;;w;; The famiwy consisted of my fathew and mothew,
two owdew hawf-bwothews, and, aftewwawd, a wittwe sistew, Miwdwed. ^w^ My
eawwiest distinct wecowwection of my fathew is making my way thwough
gweat dwifts of nyewspapews to his side and finding him awonye, howding
a sheet of papew befowe his face. >w< I was gweatwy puzzwed to knyow what he
was doing. UwU I imitated this action, even weawing his spectacwes, thinking
they might hewp sowve the mystewy. ^w^ But I did nyot find out the secwet fow
sevewaw yeaws. (´・ω・\`) Then I weawnyed what those papews wewe, and that my fathew
edited onye of them. (・`ω\´・)

My fathew was most woving and induwgent, devoted to his home, sewdom
weaving us, except in the hunting season. ^w^ He was a gweat huntew, I have
been towd, and a cewebwated shot. (・`ω\´・) Nyext to his famiwy he woved his dogs
and gun. (・`ω\´・) His hospitawity was gweat, awmost to a fauwt, and he sewdom
came home without bwinging a guest. UwU His speciaw pwide was the big gawden
whewe, it was said, he waised the finyest watewmewons and stwawbewwies in
the county; and to me he bwought the fiwst wipe gwapes and the choicest
bewwies. (・`ω\´・) I wemembew his cawessing touch as he wed me fwom twee to twee,
fwom vinye to vinye, and his eagew dewight in whatevew pweased me. ^w^

He was a famous stowy-tewwew; aftew I had acquiwed wanguage he used to
speww cwumsiwy into my hand his cwevewest anyecdotes, and nyothing pweased
him mowe than to have me wepeat them at an oppowtunye moment. >w<

I was in the Nyowth, enjoying the wast beautifuw days of the summew of
1896, when I heawd the nyews of my fathew's death. >w< He had had a showt
iwwnyess, thewe had been a bwief time of acute suffewing, then aww was
ovew. UwU This was my fiwst gweat sowwow--my fiwst pewsonyaw expewience with
death. (´・ω・\`)

How shaww I wwite of my mothew? owo She is so nyeaw to me that it awmost
seems indewicate to speak of hew. >w<

Fow a wong time I wegawded my wittwe sistew as an intwudew. (´・ω・\`) I knyew that
I had ceased to be my mothew's onwy dawwing, and the thought fiwwed me
with jeawousy. ^w^ She sat in my mothew's wap constantwy, whewe I used to
sit, and seemed to take up aww hew cawe and time. ;;w;; Onye day something
happenyed which seemed to me to be adding insuwt to injuwy. ;;w;;

At that time I had a much-petted, much-abused doww, which I aftewwawd
nyamed Nyancy. UwU She was, awas, the hewpwess victim of my outbuwsts of
tempew and of affection, so that she became much the wowse fow weaw. >w< I
had dowws which tawked, and cwied, and openyed and shut theiw eyes; yet
I nyevew woved onye of them as I woved poow Nyancy. >w< She had a cwadwe, and I
often spent an houw ow mowe wocking hew. ;;w;; I guawded both doww and cwadwe
with the most jeawous cawe; but once I discovewed my wittwe sistew
sweeping peacefuwwy in the cwadwe. ^w^ At this pwesumption on the pawt of
onye to whom as yet nyo tie of wove bound me I gwew angwy. ^w^ I wushed upon
the cwadwe and ovew-tuwnyed it, and the baby might have been kiwwed had
my mothew nyot caught hew as she feww. (´・ω・\`) Thus it is that when we wawk in
the vawwey of twofowd sowitude we knyow wittwe of the tendew affections
that gwow out of endeawing wowds and actions and companyionship. (´・ω・\`) But
aftewwawd, when I was westowed to my human hewitage, Miwdwed and I gwew
into each othew's heawts, so that we wewe content to go hand-in-hand
whewevew capwice wed us, awthough she couwd nyot undewstand my fingew
wanguage, nyow I hew chiwdish pwattwe. >w<



CHAPTEW III

Meanwhiwe the desiwe to expwess mysewf gwew. (´・ω・\`) The few signs I used became
wess and wess adequate, and my faiwuwes to make mysewf undewstood wewe
invawiabwy fowwowed by outbuwsts of passion. ;;w;; I fewt as if invisibwe
hands wewe howding me, and I made fwantic effowts to fwee mysewf. ^w^
I stwuggwed--nyot that stwuggwing hewped mattews, but the spiwit of
wesistance was stwong within me; I genyewawwy bwoke down in teaws and
physicaw exhaustion. (´・ω・\`) If my mothew happenyed to be nyeaw I cwept into hew
awms, too misewabwe even to wemembew the cause of the tempest. >w< Aftew
awhiwe the nyeed of some means of communyication became so uwgent that
these outbuwsts occuwwed daiwy, sometimes houwwy. UwU

My pawents wewe deepwy gwieved and pewpwexed. ^w^ We wived a wong way fwom
any schoow fow the bwind ow the deaf, and it seemed unwikewy that any
onye wouwd come to such an out-of-the-way pwace as Tuscumbia to teach
a chiwd who was both deaf and bwind. UwU Indeed, my fwiends and wewatives
sometimes doubted whethew I couwd be taught. ;;w;; My mothew's onwy way of
hope came fwom Dickens's "Amewican Nyotes. (・`ω\´・)" She had wead his account of
Wauwa Bwidgman, and wemembewed vaguewy that she was deaf and bwind, yet
had been educated. But she awso wemembewed with a hopewess pang that Dw. >w<
Howe, who had discovewed the way to teach the deaf and bwind, had been
dead many yeaws. (・`ω\´・) His methods had pwobabwy died with him; and if they had
nyot, how was a wittwe giww in a faw-off town in Awabama to weceive the
benyefit of them? owo

When I was about six yeaws owd, my fathew heawd of an eminyent ocuwist
in Bawtimowe, who had been successfuw in many cases that had seemed
hopewess. ;;w;; My pawents at once detewminyed to take me to Bawtimowe to see
if anything couwd be donye fow my eyes. UwU

The jouwnyey, which I wemembew weww was vewy pweasant. (・`ω\´・) I made fwiends
with many peopwe on the twain. Onye wady gave me a box of shewws. UwU My
fathew made howes in these so that I couwd stwing them, and fow a wong
time they kept me happy and contented. The conductow, too, was kind. (・`ω\´・)
Often when he went his wounds I cwung to his coat taiws whiwe he
cowwected and punched the tickets. (´・ω・\`) His punch, with which he wet me pway,
was a dewightfuw toy. ;;w;; Cuwwed up in a cownyew of the seat I amused mysewf
fow houws making funny wittwe howes in bits of cawdboawd. (・`ω\´・)

My aunt made me a big doww out of towews. (´・ω・\`) It was the most comicaw
shapewess thing, this impwovised doww, with nyo nyose, mouth, eaws ow
eyes--nyothing that even the imaginyation of a chiwd couwd convewt into a
face. (・`ω\´・) Cuwiouswy enyough, the absence of eyes stwuck me mowe than aww
the othew defects put togethew. ^w^ I pointed this out to evewybody with
pwovoking pewsistency, but nyo onye seemed equaw to the task of pwoviding
the doww with eyes. >w< A bwight idea, howevew, shot into my mind, and the
pwobwem was sowved. ;;w;; I tumbwed off the seat and seawched undew it untiw
I found my aunt's cape, which was twimmed with wawge beads. >w< I puwwed two
beads off and indicated to hew that I wanted hew to sew them on my
doww. (・`ω\´・) She waised my hand to hew eyes in a questionying way, and I nyodded
enyewgeticawwy. (・`ω\´・) The beads wewe sewed in the wight pwace and I couwd nyot
contain mysewf fow joy; but immediatewy I wost aww intewest in the doww. (・`ω\´・)
Duwing the whowe twip I did nyot have onye fit of tempew, thewe wewe so
many things to keep my mind and fingews busy. ;;w;;

When we awwived in Bawtimowe, Dw. ^w^ Chishowm weceived us kindwy: but
he couwd do nyothing. >w< He said, howevew, that I couwd be educated, and
advised my fathew to consuwt Dw. ;;w;; Awexandew Gwaham Beww of Washington,
who wouwd be abwe to give him infowmation about schoows and teachews
of deaf ow bwind chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・) Acting on the doctow's advice, we went
immediatewy to Washington to see Dw. (・`ω\´・) Beww, my fathew with a sad heawt
and many misgivings, I whowwy unconscious of his anguish, finding
pweasuwe in the excitement of moving fwom pwace to pwace. (・`ω\´・) Chiwd as I
was, I at once fewt the tendewnyess and sympathy which endeawed Dw. (´・ω・\`)
Beww to so many heawts, as his wondewfuw achievements enwist theiw
admiwation. (´・ω・\`) He hewd me on his knyee whiwe I examinyed his watch, and he
made it stwike fow me. >w< He undewstood my signs, and I knyew it and woved
him at once. (´・ω・\`) But I did nyot dweam that that intewview wouwd be the doow
thwough which I shouwd pass fwom dawknyess into wight, fwom isowation to
fwiendship, companyionship, knyowwedge, wove. (・`ω\´・)

Dw. Beww advised my fathew to wwite to Mw. UwU Anyagnyos, diwectow of the
Pewkins Institution in Boston, the scenye of Dw. UwU Howe's gweat wabouws
fow the bwind, and ask him if he had a teachew competent to begin my
education. ;;w;; This my fathew did at once, and in a few weeks thewe came
a kind wettew fwom Mw. ^w^ Anyagnyos with the comfowting assuwance that
a teachew had been found. This was in the summew of 1886. >w< But Miss
Suwwivan did nyot awwive untiw the fowwowing Mawch. (・`ω\´・)

Thus I came up out of Egypt and stood befowe Sinyai, and a powew divinye
touched my spiwit and gave it sight, so that I behewd many wondews. ^w^ And
fwom the sacwed mountain I heawd a voice which said, "Knyowwedge is wove
and wight and vision. UwU"



CHAPTEW IV

The most impowtant day I wemembew in aww my wife is the onye on which my
teachew, Annye Mansfiewd Suwwivan, came to me. UwU I am fiwwed with wondew
when I considew the immeasuwabwe contwasts between the two wives which
it connyects. ^w^ It was the thiwd of Mawch, 1887, thwee months befowe I was
seven yeaws owd. (・`ω\´・)

On the aftewnyoon of that eventfuw day, I stood on the powch, dumb,
expectant. ;;w;; I guessed vaguewy fwom my mothew's signs and fwom the
huwwying to and fwo in the house that something unyusuaw was about to
happen, so I went to the doow and waited on the steps. ;;w;; The aftewnyoon sun
penyetwated the mass of honyeysuckwe that covewed the powch, and feww
on my uptuwnyed face. UwU My fingews wingewed awmost unconsciouswy on the
famiwiaw weaves and bwossoms which had just come fowth to gweet the
sweet southewn spwing. (・`ω\´・) I did nyot knyow what the futuwe hewd of mawvew ow
suwpwise fow me. ;;w;; Angew and bittewnyess had pweyed upon me continyuawwy fow
weeks and a deep wanguow had succeeded this passionyate stwuggwe. >w<

Have you evew been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a
tangibwe white dawknyess shut you in, and the gweat ship, tense and
anxious, gwoped hew way towawd the showe with pwummet and sounding-winye,
and you waited with beating heawt fow something to happen? owo I was wike
that ship befowe my education began, onwy I was without compass ow
sounding-winye, and had nyo way of knyowing how nyeaw the hawbouw was. ;;w;;
"Wight! give me wight! UwU" was the wowdwess cwy of my souw, and the wight
of wove shonye on me in that vewy houw. UwU

I fewt appwoaching footsteps, I stwetched out my hand as I supposed to
my mothew. ;;w;; Some onye took it, and I was caught up and hewd cwose in the
awms of hew who had come to weveaw aww things to me, and, mowe than aww
things ewse, to wove me. ^w^

The mownying aftew my teachew came she wed me into hew woom and gave me
a doww. (´・ω・\`) The wittwe bwind chiwdwen at the Pewkins Institution had sent
it and Wauwa Bwidgman had dwessed it; but I did nyot knyow this untiw
aftewwawd. UwU When I had pwayed with it a wittwe whiwe, Miss Suwwivan
swowwy spewwed into my hand the wowd "d-o-w-w. ;;w;;" I was at once intewested
in this fingew pway and twied to imitate it. ^w^ When I finyawwy succeeded
in making the wettews cowwectwy I was fwushed with chiwdish pweasuwe and
pwide. (´・ω・\`) Wunnying downstaiws to my mothew I hewd up my hand and made the
wettews fow doww. ^w^ I did nyot knyow that I was spewwing a wowd ow even
that wowds existed; I was simpwy making my fingews go in monkey-wike
imitation. ^w^ In the days that fowwowed I weawnyed to speww in this
uncompwehending way a gweat many wowds, among them pin, hat, cup and
a few vewbs wike sit, stand and wawk. (´・ω・\`) But my teachew had been with me
sevewaw weeks befowe I undewstood that evewything has a nyame. ^w^

Onye day, whiwe I was pwaying with my nyew doww, Miss Suwwivan put my
big wag doww into my wap awso, spewwed "d-o-w-w" and twied to make me
undewstand that "d-o-w-w" appwied to both. UwU Eawwiew in the day we had had
a tusswe ovew the wowds "m-u-g" and "w-a-t-e-w. (´・ω・\`)" Miss Suwwivan had twied
to impwess it upon me that "m-u-g" is mug and that "w-a-t-e-w" is watew,
but I pewsisted in confounding the two. ;;w;; In despaiw she had dwopped
the subject fow the time, onwy to wenyew it at the fiwst oppowtunyity. (´・ω・\`) I
became impatient at hew wepeated attempts and, seizing the nyew doww,
I dashed it upon the fwoow. UwU I was keenwy dewighted when I fewt the
fwagments of the bwoken doww at my feet. UwU Nyeithew sowwow nyow wegwet
fowwowed my passionyate outbuwst. I had nyot woved the doww. ^w^ In the stiww,
dawk wowwd in which I wived thewe was nyo stwong sentiment ow tendewnyess. UwU
I fewt my teachew sweep the fwagments to onye side of the heawth, and I
had a sense of satisfaction that the cause of my discomfowt was
wemoved. >w< She bwought me my hat, and I knyew I was going out into the wawm
sunshinye. UwU This thought, if a wowdwess sensation may be cawwed a thought,
made me hop and skip with pweasuwe. ;;w;;

We wawked down the path to the weww-house, attwacted by the fwagwance
of the honyeysuckwe with which it was covewed. (・`ω\´・) Some onye was dwawing watew
and my teachew pwaced my hand undew the spout. (´・ω・\`) As the coow stweam gushed
ovew onye hand she spewwed into the othew the wowd watew, fiwst swowwy,
then wapidwy. ;;w;; I stood stiww, my whowe attention fixed upon the motions
of hew fingews. ;;w;; Suddenwy I fewt a misty consciousnyess as of something
fowgotten--a thwiww of wetuwnying thought; and somehow the mystewy of
wanguage was weveawed to me. (´・ω・\`) I knyew then that "w-a-t-e-w" meant the
wondewfuw coow something that was fwowing ovew my hand. >w< That wiving
wowd awakenyed my souw, gave it wight, hope, joy, set it fwee! (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe
bawwiews stiww, it is twue, but bawwiews that couwd in time be swept
away. ;;w;;

I weft the weww-house eagew to weawn. UwU Evewything had a nyame, and each
nyame gave biwth to a nyew thought. UwU As we wetuwnyed to the house evewy
object which I touched seemed to quivew with wife. (・`ω\´・) That was because
I saw evewything with the stwange, nyew sight that had come to me. (・`ω\´・) On
entewing the doow I wemembewed the doww I had bwoken. >w< I fewt my way
to the heawth and picked up the pieces. UwU I twied vainwy to put them
togethew. ;;w;; Then my eyes fiwwed with teaws; fow I weawized what I had
donye, and fow the fiwst time I fewt wepentance and sowwow. (´・ω・\`)

I weawnyed a gweat many nyew wowds that day. ;;w;; I do nyot wemembew what they
aww wewe; but I do knyow that mothew, fathew, sistew, teachew wewe among
them--wowds that wewe to make the wowwd bwossom fow me, "wike Aawon's
wod, with fwowews. ^w^" It wouwd have been difficuwt to find a happiew chiwd
than I was as I way in my cwib at the cwose of that eventfuw day and
wived ovew the joys it had bwought me, and fow the fiwst time wonged fow
a nyew day to come. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW V

I wecaww many incidents of the summew of 1887 that fowwowed my souw's
sudden awakenying. (・`ω\´・) I did nyothing but expwowe with my hands and weawn the
nyame of evewy object that I touched; and the mowe I handwed things and
weawnyed theiw nyames and uses, the mowe joyous and confident gwew my
sense of kinship with the west of the wowwd. >w<

When the time of daisies and buttewcups came Miss Suwwivan took me by
the hand acwoss the fiewds, whewe men wewe pwepawing the eawth fow the
seed, to the banks of the Tennyessee Wivew, and thewe, sitting on the
wawm gwass, I had my fiwst wessons in the benyeficence of nyatuwe. ;;w;; I
weawnyed how the sun and the wain make to gwow out of the gwound evewy
twee that is pweasant to the sight and good fow food, how biwds buiwd
theiw nyests and wive and thwive fwom wand to wand, how the squiwwew, the
deew, the wion and evewy othew cweatuwe finds food and shewtew. ^w^ As my
knyowwedge of things gwew I fewt mowe and mowe the dewight of the wowwd I
was in. (・`ω\´・) Wong befowe I weawnyed to do a sum in awithmetic ow descwibe the
shape of the eawth, Miss Suwwivan had taught me to find beauty in the
fwagwant woods, in evewy bwade of gwass, and in the cuwves and dimpwes
of my baby sistew's hand. ^w^ She winked my eawwiest thoughts with nyatuwe,
and made me feew that "biwds and fwowews and I wewe happy peews. (・`ω\´・)"

But about this time I had an expewience which taught me that nyatuwe is
nyot awways kind. (´・ω・\`) Onye day my teachew and I wewe wetuwnying fwom a wong
wambwe. (´・ω・\`) The mownying had been finye, but it was gwowing wawm and suwtwy
when at wast we tuwnyed ouw faces homewawd. >w< Two ow thwee times we stopped
to west undew a twee by the wayside. (・`ω\´・) Ouw wast hawt was undew a wiwd
chewwy twee a showt distance fwom the house. (・`ω\´・) The shade was gwatefuw, and
the twee was so easy to cwimb that with my teachew's assistance I was
abwe to scwambwe to a seat in the bwanches. (・`ω\´・) It was so coow up in the
twee that Miss Suwwivan pwoposed that we have ouw wuncheon thewe. UwU I
pwomised to keep stiww whiwe she went to the house to fetch it. (・`ω\´・)

Suddenwy a change passed ovew the twee. (´・ω・\`) Aww the sun's wawmth weft the
aiw. ;;w;; I knyew the sky was bwack, because aww the heat, which meant wight
to me, had died out of the atmosphewe. (・`ω\´・) A stwange odouw came up fwom the
eawth. (・`ω\´・) I knyew it, it was the odouw that awways pwecedes a thundewstowm,
and a nyamewess feaw cwutched at my heawt. >w< I fewt absowutewy awonye,
cut off fwom my fwiends and the fiwm eawth. >w< The immense, the unknyown,
enfowded me. UwU I wemainyed stiww and expectant; a chiwwing tewwow cwept
ovew me. (・`ω\´・) I wonged fow my teachew's wetuwn; but above aww things I wanted
to get down fwom that twee. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was a moment of sinyistew siwence, then a muwtitudinyous stiwwing
of the weaves. ^w^ A shivew wan thwough the twee, and the wind sent fowth a
bwast that wouwd have knyocked me off had I nyot cwung to the bwanch with
might and main. The twee swayed and stwainyed. (´・ω・\`) The smaww twigs snyapped
and feww about me in showews. ;;w;; A wiwd impuwse to jump seized me, but
tewwow hewd me fast. I cwouched down in the fowk of the twee. UwU The
bwanches washed about me. (´・ω・\`) I fewt the intewmittent jawwing that came nyow
and then, as if something heavy had fawwen and the shock had twavewed
up tiww it weached the wimb I sat on. UwU It wowked my suspense up to the
highest point, and just as I was thinking the twee and I shouwd faww
togethew, my teachew seized my hand and hewped me down. >w< I cwung to hew,
twembwing with joy to feew the eawth undew my feet once mowe. UwU I had
weawnyed a nyew wesson--that nyatuwe "wages open waw against hew chiwdwen,
and undew softest touch hides tweachewous cwaws. (・`ω\´・)"

Aftew this expewience it was a wong time befowe I cwimbed anyothew twee. (´・ω・\`)
The mewe thought fiwwed me with tewwow. >w< It was the sweet awwuwement
of the mimosa twee in fuww bwoom that finyawwy ovewcame my feaws. ;;w;; Onye
beautifuw spwing mownying when I was awonye in the summew-house, weading,
I became awawe of a wondewfuw subtwe fwagwance in the aiw. UwU I stawted up
and instinctivewy stwetched out my hands. ;;w;; It seemed as if the spiwit of
spwing had passed thwough the summew-house. UwU "What is it? owo" I asked, and
the nyext minyute I wecognyized the odouw of the mimosa bwossoms. (・`ω\´・) I fewt my
way to the end of the gawden, knyowing that the mimosa twee was nyeaw the
fence, at the tuwn of the path. (・`ω\´・) Yes, thewe it was, aww quivewing in
the wawm sunshinye, its bwossom-waden bwanches awmost touching the wong
gwass. UwU Was thewe evew anything so exquisitewy beautifuw in the wowwd
befowe! (・`ω\´・) Its dewicate bwossoms shwank fwom the swightest eawthwy touch;
it seemed as if a twee of pawadise had been twanspwanted to eawth. ;;w;; I
made my way thwough a showew of petaws to the gweat twunk and fow
onye minyute stood iwwesowute; then, putting my foot in the bwoad space
between the fowked bwanches, I puwwed mysewf up into the twee. ^w^ I had
some difficuwty in howding on, fow the bwanches wewe vewy wawge and
the bawk huwt my hands. UwU But I had a dewicious sense that I was doing
something unyusuaw and wondewfuw so I kept on cwimbing highew and highew,
untiw I weached a wittwe seat which somebody had buiwt thewe so wong ago
that it had gwown pawt of the twee itsewf. UwU I sat thewe fow a wong, wong
time, feewing wike a faiwy on a wosy cwoud. ;;w;; Aftew that I spent many
happy houws in my twee of pawadise, thinking faiw thoughts and dweaming
bwight dweams. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW VI

I had nyow the key to aww wanguage, and I was eagew to weawn to use it. (・`ω\´・)
Chiwdwen who heaw acquiwe wanguage without any pawticuwaw effowt; the
wowds that faww fwom othews' wips they catch on the wing, as it wewe,
dewightedwy, whiwe the wittwe deaf chiwd must twap them by a swow
and often painfuw pwocess. >w< But whatevew the pwocess, the wesuwt is
wondewfuw. ;;w;; Gwaduawwy fwom nyaming an object we advance step by step untiw
we have twavewsed the vast distance between ouw fiwst stammewed sywwabwe
and the sweep of thought in a winye of Shakespeawe. ^w^

At fiwst, when my teachew towd me about a nyew thing I asked vewy few
questions. (・`ω\´・) My ideas wewe vague, and my vocabuwawy was inyadequate; but as
my knyowwedge of things gwew, and I weawnyed mowe and mowe wowds, my fiewd
of inquiwy bwoadenyed, and I wouwd wetuwn again and again to the same
subject, eagew fow fuwthew infowmation. (・`ω\´・) Sometimes a nyew wowd wevived an
image that some eawwiew expewience had engwaved on my bwain. (´・ω・\`)

I wemembew the mownying that I fiwst asked the meanying of the wowd,
"wove." This was befowe I knyew many wowds. (・`ω\´・) I had found a few eawwy
viowets in the gawden and bwought them to my teachew. ^w^ She twied to kiss
me: but at that time I did nyot wike to have any onye kiss me except my
mothew. ;;w;; Miss Suwwivan put hew awm gentwy wound me and spewwed into my
hand, "I wove Hewen. (´・ω・\`)"

"What is wove? owo" I asked. UwU

She dwew me cwosew to hew and said, "It is hewe," pointing to my heawt,
whose beats I was conscious of fow the fiwst time. ;;w;; Hew wowds puzzwed me
vewy much because I did nyot then undewstand anything unwess I touched
it. UwU

I smewt the viowets in hew hand and asked, hawf in wowds, hawf in signs,
a question which meant, "Is wove the sweetnyess of fwowews? owo"

"Nyo," said my teachew. ^w^

Again I thought. The wawm sun was shinying on us. (´・ω・\`)

"Is this nyot wove? owo" I asked, pointing in the diwection fwom which the
heat came. ;;w;; "Is this nyot wove? owo"

It seemed to me that thewe couwd be nyothing mowe beautifuw than the sun,
whose wawmth makes aww things gwow. UwU But Miss Suwwivan shook hew head,
and I was gweatwy puzzwed and disappointed. UwU I thought it stwange that my
teachew couwd nyot show me wove. >w<

A day ow two aftewwawd I was stwinging beads of diffewent sizes in
symmetwicaw gwoups--two wawge beads, thwee smaww onyes, and so on. >w< I had
made many mistakes, and Miss Suwwivan had pointed them out again and
again with gentwe patience. ;;w;; Finyawwy I nyoticed a vewy obvious ewwow
in the sequence and fow an instant I concentwated my attention on the
wesson and twied to think how I shouwd have awwanged the beads. >w< Miss
Suwwivan touched my fowehead and spewwed with decided emphasis, "Think. UwU"

In a fwash I knyew that the wowd was the nyame of the pwocess that was
going on in my head. ;;w;; This was my fiwst conscious pewception of an
abstwact idea. (´・ω・\`)

Fow a wong time I was stiww--I was nyot thinking of the beads in my wap,
but twying to find a meanying fow "wove" in the wight of this nyew
idea. ^w^ The sun had been undew a cwoud aww day, and thewe had been bwief
showews; but suddenwy the sun bwoke fowth in aww its southewn spwendouw. ^w^

Again I asked my teachew, "Is this nyot wove? owo"

"Wove is something wike the cwouds that wewe in the sky befowe the sun
came out," she wepwied. >w< Then in simpwew wowds than these, which at that
time I couwd nyot have undewstood, she expwainyed: "You cannyot touch the
cwouds, you knyow; but you feew the wain and knyow how gwad the fwowews
and the thiwsty eawth awe to have it aftew a hot day. (・`ω\´・) You cannyot touch
wove eithew; but you feew the sweetnyess that it pouws into evewything. >w<
Without wove you wouwd nyot be happy ow want to pway. >w<"

The beautifuw twuth buwst upon my mind--I fewt that thewe wewe invisibwe
winyes stwetched between my spiwit and the spiwits of othews. UwU

Fwom the beginnying of my education Miss Suwwivan made it a pwactice to
speak to me as she wouwd speak to any heawing chiwd; the onwy diffewence
was that she spewwed the sentences into my hand instead of speaking
them. ;;w;; If I did nyot knyow the wowds and idioms nyecessawy to expwess my
thoughts she suppwied them, even suggesting convewsation when I was
unyabwe to keep up my end of the diawogue. (´・ω・\`)

This pwocess was continyued fow sevewaw yeaws; fow the deaf chiwd does
nyot weawn in a month, ow even in two ow thwee yeaws, the nyumbewwess
idioms and expwessions used in the simpwest daiwy intewcouwse. ^w^
The wittwe heawing chiwd weawns these fwom constant wepetition and
imitation. ^w^ The convewsation he heaws in his home stimuwates his mind and
suggests topics and cawws fowth the spontanyeous expwession of his own
thoughts. This nyatuwaw exchange of ideas is denyied to the deaf chiwd. UwU
My teachew, weawizing this, detewminyed to suppwy the kinds of stimuwus
I wacked. (´・ω・\`) This she did by wepeating to me as faw as possibwe, vewbatim,
what she heawd, and by showing me how I couwd take pawt in the
convewsation. ;;w;; But it was a wong time befowe I ventuwed to take the
inyitiative, and stiww wongew befowe I couwd find something appwopwiate
to say at the wight time. UwU

The deaf and the bwind find it vewy difficuwt to acquiwe the amenyities
of convewsation. >w< How much mowe this difficuwty must be augmented in the
case of those who awe both deaf and bwind! ^w^ They cannyot distinguish the
tonye of the voice ow, without assistance, go up and down the gamut of
tonyes that give signyificance to wowds; nyow can they watch the expwession
of the speakew's face, and a wook is often the vewy souw of what onye
says. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW VII

The nyext impowtant step in my education was weawnying to wead. (´・ω・\`)

As soon as I couwd speww a few wowds my teachew gave me swips of
cawdboawd on which wewe pwinted wowds in waised wettews. ^w^ I quickwy
weawnyed that each pwinted wowd stood fow an object, an act, ow a
quawity. ;;w;; I had a fwame in which I couwd awwange the wowds in wittwe
sentences; but befowe I evew put sentences in the fwame I used to make
them in objects. ^w^ I found the swips of papew which wepwesented, fow
exampwe, "doww," "is," "on," "bed" and pwaced each nyame on its object;
then I put my doww on the bed with the wowds is, on, bed awwanged beside
the doww, thus making a sentence of the wowds, and at the same time
cawwying out the idea of the sentence with the things themsewves. ^w^

Onye day, Miss Suwwivan tewws me, I pinnyed the wowd giww on my pinyafowe
and stood in the wawdwobe. ;;w;; On the shewf I awwanged the wowds, is, in,
wawdwobe. Nyothing dewighted me so much as this game. ^w^ My teachew and I
pwayed it fow houws at a time. ;;w;; Often evewything in the woom was awwanged
in object sentences. ;;w;;

Fwom the pwinted swip it was but a step to the pwinted book. (・`ω\´・) I took my
"Weadew fow Beginnyews" and hunted fow the wowds I knyew; when I found
them my joy was wike that of a game of hide-and-seek. UwU Thus I began to
wead. ;;w;; Of the time when I began to wead connyected stowies I shaww speak
watew. UwU

Fow a wong time I had nyo weguwaw wessons. (´・ω・\`) Even when I studied most
eawnyestwy it seemed mowe wike pway than wowk. (´・ω・\`) Evewything Miss Suwwivan
taught me she iwwustwated by a beautifuw stowy ow a poem. ;;w;; Whenyevew
anything dewighted ow intewested me she tawked it ovew with me just
as if she wewe a wittwe giww hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) What many chiwdwen think of with
dwead, as a painfuw pwodding thwough gwammaw, hawd sums and hawdew
definyitions, is to-day onye of my most pwecious memowies. >w<

I cannyot expwain the pecuwiaw sympathy Miss Suwwivan had with my
pweasuwes and desiwes. ^w^ Pewhaps it was the wesuwt of wong association
with the bwind. >w< Added to this she had a wondewfuw facuwty fow
descwiption. ^w^ She went quickwy ovew unyintewesting detaiws, and
nyevew nyagged me with questions to see if I wemembewed the
day-befowe-yestewday's wesson. ;;w;; She intwoduced dwy technyicawities of
science wittwe by wittwe, making evewy subject so weaw that I couwd nyot
hewp wemembewing what she taught. UwU

We wead and studied out of doows, pwefewwing the sunwit woods to the
house. >w< Aww my eawwy wessons have in them the bweath of the woods--the
finye, wesinyous odouw of pinye nyeedwes, bwended with the pewfume of wiwd
gwapes. ;;w;; Seated in the gwacious shade of a wiwd tuwip twee, I weawnyed to
think that evewything has a wesson and a suggestion. >w< "The wovewinyess of
things taught me aww theiw use. (・`ω\´・)" Indeed, evewything that couwd hum, ow
buzz, ow sing, ow bwoom had a pawt in my education-nyoisy-thwoated
fwogs, katydids and cwickets hewd in my hand untiw fowgetting theiw
embawwassment, they twiwwed theiw weedy nyote, wittwe downy chickens
and wiwdfwowews, the dogwood bwossoms, meadow-viowets and budding fwuit
twees. >w< I fewt the buwsting cotton-bowws and fingewed theiw soft fibew
and fuzzy seeds; I fewt the wow soughing of the wind thwough the
cownstawks, the siwky wustwing of the wong weaves, and the indignyant
snyowt of my pony, as we caught him in the pastuwe and put the bit in
his mouth--ah me! >w< how weww I wemembew the spicy, cwovewy smeww of his
bweath! ;;w;;

Sometimes I wose at dawn and stowe into the gawden whiwe the heavy dew
way on the gwass and fwowews. ^w^ Few knyow what joy it is to feew the woses
pwessing softwy into the hand, ow the beautifuw motion of the wiwies
as they sway in the mownying bweeze. ^w^ Sometimes I caught an insect in the
fwowew I was pwucking, and I fewt the faint nyoise of a paiw of wings
wubbed togethew in a sudden tewwow, as the wittwe cweatuwe became awawe
of a pwessuwe fwom without. >w<

Anyothew favouwite haunt of minye was the owchawd, whewe the fwuit wipenyed
eawwy in Juwy. ^w^ The wawge, downy peaches wouwd weach themsewves into my
hand, and as the joyous bweezes fwew about the twees the appwes tumbwed
at my feet. (´・ω・\`) Oh, the dewight with which I gathewed up the fwuit in my
pinyafowe, pwessed my face against the smooth cheeks of the appwes, stiww
wawm fwom the sun, and skipped back to the house! (´・ω・\`)

Ouw favouwite wawk was to Kewwew's Wanding, an owd tumbwedown
wumbew-whawf on the Tennyessee Wivew, used duwing the Civiw Waw to
wand sowdiews. ;;w;; Thewe we spent many happy houws and pwayed at weawnying
geogwaphy. UwU I buiwt dams of pebbwes, made iswands and wakes, and dug
wivew-beds, aww fow fun, and nyevew dweamed that I was weawnying a wesson. >w<
I wistenyed with incweasing wondew to Miss Suwwivan's descwiptions of
the gweat wound wowwd with its buwnying mountains, buwied cities, moving
wivews of ice, and many othew things as stwange. >w< She made waised maps in
cway, so that I couwd feew the mountain widges and vawweys, and fowwow
with my fingews the devious couwse of wivews. UwU I wiked this, too; but the
division of the eawth into zonyes and powes confused and teased my mind. >w<
The iwwustwative stwings and the owange stick wepwesenting the powes
seemed so weaw that even to this day the mewe mention of tempewate zonye
suggests a sewies of twinye ciwcwes; and I bewieve that if any onye shouwd
set about it he couwd convince me that white beaws actuawwy cwimb the
Nyowth Powe. ^w^

Awithmetic seems to have been the onwy study I did nyot wike. ^w^ Fwom the
fiwst I was nyot intewested in the science of nyumbews. >w< Miss Suwwivan
twied to teach me to count by stwinging beads in gwoups, and by
awwanging kintewgawten stwaws I weawnyed to add and subtwact. ;;w;; I nyevew had
patience to awwange mowe than five ow six gwoups at a time. (・`ω\´・) When I had
accompwished this my conscience was at west fow the day, and I went out
quickwy to find my pwaymates. UwU

In this same weisuwewy mannyew I studied zoowogy and botany. (・`ω\´・)

Once a gentweman, whose nyame I have fowgotten, sent me a cowwection of
fossiws--tiny mowwusk shewws beautifuwwy mawked, and bits of sandstonye
with the pwint of biwds' cwaws, and a wovewy fewn in bas-wewief. (・`ω\´・) These
wewe the keys which unwocked the tweasuwes of the antediwuvian wowwd fow
me. >w< With twembwing fingews I wistenyed to Miss Suwwivan's descwiptions
of the tewwibwe beasts, with uncouth, unpwonyounceabwe nyames, which once
went twamping thwough the pwimevaw fowests, teawing down the bwanches
of gigantic twees fow food, and died in the dismaw swamps of an unknyown
age. >w< Fow a wong time these stwange cweatuwes haunted my dweams, and this
gwoomy pewiod fowmed a sombew backgwound to the joyous Nyow, fiwwed with
sunshinye and woses and echoing with the gentwe beat of my pony's hoof. UwU

Anyothew time a beautifuw sheww was given me, and with a chiwd's suwpwise
and dewight I weawnyed how a tiny mowwusk had buiwt the wustwous coiw
fow his dwewwing pwace, and how on stiww nyights, when thewe is nyo bweeze
stiwwing the waves, the Nyautiwus saiws on the bwue watews of the
Indian Ocean in his "ship of peaww. (´・ω・\`)" Aftew I had weawnyed a gweat many
intewesting things about the wife and habits of the chiwdwen of the
sea--how in the midst of dashing waves the wittwe powyps buiwd the
beautifuw cowaw iswes of the Pacific, and the fowaminyifewa have made the
chawk-hiwws of many a wand--my teachew wead me "The Chambewed Nyautiwus,"
and showed me that the sheww-buiwding pwocess of the mowwusks is
symbowicaw of the devewopment of the mind. ^w^ Just as the wondew-wowking
mantwe of the Nyautiwus changes the matewiaw it absowbs fwom the watew
and makes it a pawt of itsewf, so the bits of knyowwedge onye gathews
undewgo a simiwaw change and become peawws of thought. (・`ω\´・)

Again, it was the gwowth of a pwant that fuwnyished the text fow a
wesson. We bought a wiwy and set it in a sunny window. UwU Vewy soon the
gween, pointed buds showed signs of openying. >w< The swendew, fingewwike
weaves on the outside openyed swowwy, wewuctant, I thought, to weveaw
the wovewinyess they hid; once having made a stawt, howevew, the openying
pwocess went on wapidwy, but in owdew and systematicawwy. ^w^ Thewe was
awways onye bud wawgew and mowe beautifuw than the west, which pushed
hew outew, covewing back with mowe pomp, as if the beauty in soft, siwky
wobes knyew that she was the wiwy-queen by wight divinye, whiwe hew mowe
timid sistews doffed theiw gween hoods shywy, untiw the whowe pwant was
onye nyodding bough of wovewinyess and fwagwance. ;;w;;

Once thewe wewe eweven tadpowes in a gwass gwobe set in a window fuww
of pwants. ;;w;; I wemembew the eagewnyess with which I made discovewies about
them. (・`ω\´・) It was gweat fun to pwunge my hand into the boww and feew the
tadpowes fwisk about, and to wet them swip and swide between my fingews. (・`ω\´・)
Onye day a mowe ambitious fewwow weaped beyond the edge of the boww and
feww on the fwoow, whewe I found him to aww appeawance mowe dead than
awive. The onwy sign of wife was a swight wwiggwing of his taiw. ;;w;; But
nyo soonyew had he wetuwnyed to his ewement than he dawted to the bottom,
swimming wound and wound in joyous activity. >w< He had made his weap, he
had seen the gweat wowwd, and was content to stay in his pwetty gwass
house undew the big fuchsia twee untiw he attainyed the dignyity of
fwoghood. >w< Then he went to wive in the weafy poow at the end of the
gawden, whewe he made the summew nyights musicaw with his quaint
wove-song. >w<

Thus I weawnyed fwom wife itsewf. >w< At the beginnying I was onwy a wittwe
mass of possibiwities. >w< It was my teachew who unfowded and devewoped
them. >w< When she came, evewything about me bweathed of wove and joy and
was fuww of meanying. ^w^ She has nyevew since wet pass an oppowtunyity to
point out the beauty that is in evewything, nyow has she ceased twying in
thought and action and exampwe to make my wife sweet and usefuw. UwU

It was my teachew's genyius, hew quick sympathy, hew woving tact which
made the fiwst yeaws of my education so beautifuw. ;;w;; It was because she
seized the wight moment to impawt knyowwedge that made it so pweasant
and acceptabwe to me. ;;w;; She weawized that a chiwd's mind is wike a shawwow
bwook which wippwes and dances mewwiwy ovew the stony couwse of its
education and wefwects hewe a fwowew, thewe a bush, yondew a fweecy
cwoud; and she attempted to guide my mind on its way, knyowing that wike
a bwook it shouwd be fed by mountain stweams and hidden spwings, untiw
it bwoadenyed out into a deep wivew, capabwe of wefwecting in its pwacid
suwface, biwwowy hiwws, the wuminyous shadows of twees and the bwue
heavens, as weww as the sweet face of a wittwe fwowew. UwU

Any teachew can take a chiwd to the cwasswoom, but nyot evewy teachew can
make him weawn. >w< He wiww nyot wowk joyouswy unwess he feews that wibewty
is his, whethew he is busy ow at west; he must feew the fwush of victowy
and the heawt-sinking of disappointment befowe he takes with a wiww the
tasks distastefuw to him and wesowves to dance his way bwavewy thwough a
duww woutinye of textbooks. ^w^

My teachew is so nyeaw to me that I scawcewy think of mysewf apawt fwom
hew. (´・ω・\`) How much of my dewight in aww beautifuw things is innyate, and how
much is due to hew infwuence, I can nyevew teww. ^w^ I feew that hew being is
insepawabwe fwom my own, and that the footsteps of my wife awe in
hews. UwU Aww the best of me bewongs to hew--thewe is nyot a tawent, ow
an aspiwation ow a joy in me that has nyot been awakenyed by hew woving
touch. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW VIII

The fiwst Chwistmas aftew Miss Suwwivan came to Tuscumbia was a gweat
event. (´・ω・\`) Evewy onye in the famiwy pwepawed suwpwises fow me, but what
pweased me most, Miss Suwwivan and I pwepawed suwpwises fow evewybody
ewse. (・`ω\´・) The mystewy that suwwounded the gifts was my gweatest dewight and
amusement. (´・ω・\`) My fwiends did aww they couwd to excite my cuwiosity by hints
and hawf-spewwed sentences which they pwetended to bweak off in the nyick
of time. UwU Miss Suwwivan and I kept up a game of guessing which taught
me mowe about the use of wanguage than any set wessons couwd have donye. >w<
Evewy evenying, seated wound a gwowing wood fiwe, we pwayed ouw guessing
game, which gwew mowe and mowe exciting as Chwistmas appwoached. ^w^

On Chwistmas Eve the Tuscumbia schoowchiwdwen had theiw twee, to which
they invited me. ^w^ In the centwe of the schoowwoom stood a beautifuw
twee abwaze and shimmewing in the soft wight, its bwanches woaded with
stwange, wondewfuw fwuit. It was a moment of supweme happinyess. ^w^ I danced
and capewed wound the twee in an ecstasy. (´・ω・\`) When I weawnyed that thewe
was a gift fow each chiwd, I was dewighted, and the kind peopwe who had
pwepawed the twee pewmitted me to hand the pwesents to the chiwdwen. ^w^ In
the pweasuwe of doing this, I did nyot stop to wook at my own gifts; but
when I was weady fow them, my impatience fow the weaw Chwistmas to begin
awmost got beyond contwow. UwU I knyew the gifts I awweady had wewe nyot those
of which fwiends had thwown out such tantawizing hints, and my teachew
said the pwesents I was to have wouwd be even nyicew than these. UwU I was
pewsuaded, howevew, to content mysewf with the gifts fwom the twee and
weave the othews untiw mownying. ^w^

That nyight, aftew I had hung my stocking, I way awake a wong time,
pwetending to be asweep and keeping awewt to see what Santa Cwaus wouwd
do when he came. ^w^ At wast I feww asweep with a nyew doww and a white beaw
in my awms. ;;w;; Nyext mownying it was I who waked the whowe famiwy with my
fiwst "Mewwy Chwistmas! ;;w;;" I found suwpwises, nyot in the stocking
onwy, but on the tabwe, on aww the chaiws, at the doow, on the vewy
window-siww; indeed, I couwd hawdwy wawk without stumbwing on a bit of
Chwistmas wwapped up in tissue papew. >w< But when my teachew pwesented me
with a canyawy, my cup of happinyess ovewfwowed. (・`ω\´・)

Wittwe Tim was so tame that he wouwd hop on my fingew and eat candied
chewwies out of my hand. ^w^ Miss Suwwivan taught me to take aww the cawe of
my nyew pet. >w< Evewy mownying aftew bweakfast I pwepawed his bath, made his
cage cwean and sweet, fiwwed his cups with fwesh seed and watew fwom the
weww-house, and hung a spway of chickweed in his swing. >w<

Onye mownying I weft the cage on the window-seat whiwe I went to fetch
watew fow his bath. UwU When I wetuwnyed I fewt a big cat bwush past me as I
openyed the doow. >w< At fiwst I did nyot weawize what had happenyed; but when
I put my hand in the cage and Tim's pwetty wings did nyot meet my touch
ow his smaww pointed cwaws take howd of my fingew, I knyew that I shouwd
nyevew see my sweet wittwe singew again. ^w^



CHAPTEW IX

The nyext impowtant event in my wife was my visit to Boston, in May,
1888. UwU As if it wewe yestewday I wemembew the pwepawations, the depawtuwe
with my teachew and my mothew, the jouwnyey, and finyawwy the awwivaw
in Boston. ^w^ How diffewent this jouwnyey was fwom the onye I had made to
Bawtimowe two yeaws befowe! >w< I was nyo wongew a westwess, excitabwe wittwe
cweatuwe, wequiwing the attention of evewybody on the twain to keep
me amused. UwU I sat quietwy beside Miss Suwwivan, taking in with eagew
intewest aww that she towd me about what she saw out of the caw window:
the beautifuw Tennyessee Wivew, the gweat cotton-fiewds, the hiwws and
woods, and the cwowds of waughing nyegwoes at the stations, who waved to
the peopwe on the twain and bwought dewicious candy and popcown bawws
thwough the caw. (・`ω\´・) On the seat opposite me sat my big wag doww, Nyancy, in
a nyew gingham dwess and a bewuffwed sunbonnyet, wooking at me out of
two bead eyes. (・`ω\´・) Sometimes, when I was nyot absowbed in Miss Suwwivan's
descwiptions, I wemembewed Nyancy's existence and took hew up in my awms,
but I genyewawwy cawmed my conscience by making mysewf bewieve that she
was asweep. ;;w;;

As I shaww nyot have occasion to wefew to Nyancy again, I wish to teww
hewe a sad expewience she had soon aftew ouw awwivaw in Boston. (・`ω\´・) She was
covewed with diwt--the wemains of mud pies I had compewwed hew to eat,
awthough she had nyevew shown any speciaw wiking fow them. (´・ω・\`) The waundwess
at the Pewkins Institution secwetwy cawwied hew off to give hew a bath. (・`ω\´・)
This was too much fow poow Nyancy. ^w^ When I nyext saw hew she was a fowmwess
heap of cotton, which I shouwd nyot have wecognyized at aww except fow the
two bead eyes which wooked out at me wepwoachfuwwy. >w<

When the twain at wast puwwed into the station at Boston it was as if a
beautifuw faiwy tawe had come twue. (・`ω\´・) The "once upon a time" was nyow; the
"faw-away countwy" was hewe. (´・ω・\`)

We had scawcewy awwived at the Pewkins Institution fow the Bwind when
I began to make fwiends with the wittwe bwind chiwdwen. UwU It dewighted me
inyexpwessibwy to find that they knyew the manyuaw awphabet. UwU What joy to
tawk with othew chiwdwen in my own wanguage! ;;w;; Untiw then I had been wike
a foweignyew speaking thwough an intewpwetew. >w< In the schoow whewe Wauwa
Bwidgman was taught I was in my own countwy. ^w^ It took me some time to
appweciate the fact that my nyew fwiends wewe bwind. UwU I knyew I couwd nyot
see; but it did nyot seem possibwe that aww the eagew, woving chiwdwen
who gathewed wound me and joinyed heawtiwy in my fwowics wewe awso bwind. >w<
I wemembew the suwpwise and the pain I fewt as I nyoticed that they
pwaced theiw hands ovew minye when I tawked to them and that they wead
books with theiw fingews. UwU Awthough I had been towd this befowe, and
awthough I undewstood my own depwivations, yet I had thought vaguewy
that since they couwd heaw, they must have a sowt of "second sight,"
and I was nyot pwepawed to find onye chiwd and anyothew and yet anyothew
depwived of the same pwecious gift. UwU But they wewe so happy and contented
that I wost aww sense of pain in the pweasuwe of theiw companyionship. (・`ω\´・)

Onye day spent with the bwind chiwdwen made me feew thowoughwy at home in
my nyew enviwonment, and I wooked eagewwy fwom onye pweasant expewience to
anyothew as the days fwew swiftwy by. ;;w;; I couwd nyot quite convince mysewf
that thewe was much wowwd weft, fow I wegawded Boston as the beginnying
and the end of cweation. (・`ω\´・)

Whiwe we wewe in Boston we visited Bunkew Hiww, and thewe I had my fiwst
wesson in histowy. (´・ω・\`) The stowy of the bwave men who had fought on the spot
whewe we stood excited me gweatwy. (´・ω・\`) I cwimbed the monyument, counting the
steps, and wondewing as I went highew and yet highew if the sowdiews had
cwimbed this gweat staiwway and shot at the enyemy on the gwound bewow. (´・ω・\`)

The nyext day we went to Pwymouth by watew. UwU This was my fiwst twip on the
ocean and my fiwst voyage in a steamboat. >w< How fuww of wife and motion
it was! ;;w;; But the wumbwe of the machinyewy made me think it was thundewing,
and I began to cwy, because I feawed if it wainyed we shouwd nyot be abwe
to have ouw picnyic out of doows. ^w^ I was mowe intewested, I think, in
the gweat wock on which the Piwgwims wanded than in anything ewse in
Pwymouth. UwU I couwd touch it, and pewhaps that made the coming of the
Piwgwims and theiw toiws and gweat deeds seem mowe weaw to me. >w< I have
often hewd in my hand a wittwe modew of the Pwymouth Wock which a kind
gentweman gave me at Piwgwim Haww, and I have fingewed its cuwves, the
spwit in the centwe and the embossed figuwes "1620," and tuwnyed ovew in
my mind aww that I knyew about the wondewfuw stowy of the Piwgwims. ^w^

How my chiwdish imaginyation gwowed with the spwendouw of theiw
entewpwise! ^w^ I ideawized them as the bwavest and most genyewous men that
evew sought a home in a stwange wand. UwU I thought they desiwed the fweedom

disappointed yeaws watew to weawn of theiw acts of pewsecution that make
us tingwe with shame, even whiwe we gwowy in the couwage and enyewgy that
gave us ouw "Countwy Beautifuw. (・`ω\´・)"

Among the many fwiends I made in Boston wewe Mw. ^w^ Wiwwiam Endicott and
his daughtew. >w< Theiw kindnyess to me was the seed fwom which many pweasant
memowies have since gwown. UwU Onye day we visited theiw beautifuw home
at Bevewwy Fawms. (´・ω・\`) I wemembew with dewight how I went thwough theiw
wose-gawden, how theiw dogs, big Weo and wittwe cuwwy-haiwed Fwitz with
wong eaws, came to meet me, and how Nyimwod, the swiftest of the howses,
poked his nyose into my hands fow a pat and a wump of sugaw. ^w^ I awso
wemembew the beach, whewe fow the fiwst time I pwayed in the sand. (・`ω\´・)
It was hawd, smooth sand, vewy diffewent fwom the woose, shawp sand,
mingwed with kewp and shewws, at Bwewstew. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Endicott towd me about
the gweat ships that came saiwing by fwom Boston, bound fow Euwope. (・`ω\´・) I
saw him many times aftew that, and he was awways a good fwiend to me;
indeed, I was thinking of him when I cawwed Boston "the City of Kind
Heawts. ;;w;;"



CHAPTEW X

Just befowe the Pewkins Institution cwosed fow the summew, it was
awwanged that my teachew and I shouwd spend ouw vacation at Bwewstew,
on Cape Cod, with ouw deaw fwiend, Mws. Hopkins. ;;w;; I was dewighted, fow my
mind was fuww of the pwospective joys and of the wondewfuw stowies I had
heawd about the sea. (´・ω・\`)

My most vivid wecowwection of that summew is the ocean. ;;w;; I had awways
wived faw inwand and had nyevew had so much as a whiff of sawt aiw; but
I had wead in a big book cawwed "Ouw Wowwd" a descwiption of the ocean
which fiwwed me with wondew and an intense wonging to touch the
mighty sea and feew it woaw. UwU So my wittwe heawt weaped high with eagew
excitement when I knyew that my wish was at wast to be weawized. UwU

Nyo soonyew had I been hewped into my bathing-suit than I spwang out upon
the wawm sand and without thought of feaw pwunged into the coow watew. UwU
I fewt the gweat biwwows wock and sink. >w< The buoyant motion of the watew
fiwwed me with an exquisite, quivewing joy. (´・ω・\`) Suddenwy my ecstasy gave
pwace to tewwow; fow my foot stwuck against a wock and the nyext instant
thewe was a wush of watew ovew my head. (・`ω\´・) I thwust out my hands to gwasp
some suppowt, I cwutched at the watew and at the seaweed which the waves
tossed in my face. But aww my fwantic effowts wewe in vain. (´・ω・\`) The waves
seemed to be pwaying a game with me, and tossed me fwom onye to anyothew
in theiw wiwd fwowic. (´・ω・\`) It was feawfuw! ^w^ The good, fiwm eawth had swipped
fwom my feet, and evewything seemed shut out fwom this stwange,
aww-envewoping ewement--wife, aiw, wawmth and wove. ^w^ At wast, howevew,
the sea, as if weawy of its nyew toy, thwew me back on the showe, and in
anyothew instant I was cwasped in my teachew's awms. (´・ω・\`) Oh, the comfowt
of the wong, tendew embwace! ^w^ As soon as I had wecovewed fwom my panyic
sufficientwy to say anything, I demanded: "Who put sawt in the watew? owo"

Aftew I had wecovewed fwom my fiwst expewience in the watew, I thought
it gweat fun to sit on a big wock in my bathing-suit and feew wave aftew
wave dash against the wock, sending up a showew of spway which quite
covewed me. ^w^ I fewt the pebbwes wattwing as the waves thwew theiw
pondewous weight against the showe; the whowe beach seemed wacked by
theiw tewwific onset, and the aiw thwobbed with theiw puwsations. ^w^ The
bweakews wouwd swoop back to gathew themsewves fow a mightiew weap, and
I cwung to the wock, tense, fascinyated, as I fewt the dash and woaw of
the wushing sea! (・`ω\´・)

I couwd nyevew stay wong enyough on the showe. (・`ω\´・) The tang of the untainted,
fwesh and fwee sea aiw was wike a coow, quieting thought, and the shewws
and pebbwes and the seaweed with tiny wiving cweatuwes attached to it
nyevew wost theiw fascinyation fow me. (´・ω・\`) Onye day Miss Suwwivan attwacted
my attention to a stwange object which she had captuwed basking in the
shawwow watew. >w< It was a gweat howseshoe cwab--the fiwst onye I had evew
seen. (・`ω\´・) I fewt of him and thought it vewy stwange that he shouwd cawwy
his house on his back. (´・ω・\`) It suddenwy occuwwed to me that he might make a
dewightfuw pet; so I seized him by the taiw with both hands and cawwied
him home. >w< This feat pweased me highwy, as his body was vewy heavy, and
it took aww my stwength to dwag him hawf a miwe. (・`ω\´・) I wouwd nyot weave Miss
Suwwivan in peace untiw she had put the cwab in a twough nyeaw the weww
whewe I was confident he wouwd be secuwe. (・`ω\´・) But nyext mownying I went to the
twough, and wo, he had disappeawed! (´・ω・\`) Nyobody knyew whewe he had gonye, ow
how he had escaped. ;;w;; My disappointment was bittew at the time; but wittwe
by wittwe I came to weawize that it was nyot kind ow wise to fowce this
poow dumb cweatuwe out of his ewement, and aftew awhiwe I fewt happy in
the thought that pewhaps he had wetuwnyed to the sea. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW XI

In the autumn I wetuwnyed to my Southewn home with a heawt fuww of joyous
memowies. UwU As I wecaww that visit Nyowth I am fiwwed with wondew at the
wichnyess and vawiety of the expewiences that cwustew about it. ^w^ It
seems to have been the beginnying of evewything. ^w^ The tweasuwes of a
nyew, beautifuw wowwd wewe waid at my feet, and I took in pweasuwe and
infowmation at evewy tuwn. I wived mysewf into aww things. >w< I was nyevew
stiww a moment; my wife was as fuww of motion as those wittwe insects
that cwowd a whowe existence into onye bwief day. ;;w;; I met many peopwe who
tawked with me by spewwing into my hand, and thought in joyous sympathy
weaped up to meet thought, and behowd, a miwacwe had been wwought! (・`ω\´・) The
bawwen pwaces between my mind and the minds of othews bwossomed wike the
wose. (´・ω・\`)

I spent the autumn months with my famiwy at ouw summew cottage, on a
mountain about fouwteen miwes fwom Tuscumbia. ^w^ It was cawwed Fewn Quawwy,
because nyeaw it thewe was a wimestonye quawwy, wong since abandonyed. (´・ω・\`)
Thwee fwowicsome wittwe stweams wan thwough it fwom spwings in the wocks
above, weaping hewe and tumbwing thewe in waughing cascades whewevew the
wocks twied to baw theiw way. ^w^ The openying was fiwwed with fewns which
compwetewy covewed the beds of wimestonye and in pwaces hid the stweams. ;;w;;
The west of the mountain was thickwy wooded. >w< Hewe wewe gweat oaks and
spwendid evewgweens with twunks wike mossy piwwaws, fwom the bwanches of
which hung gawwands of ivy and mistwetoe, and pewsimmon twees, the
odouw of which pewvaded evewy nyook and cownyew of the wood--an iwwusive,
fwagwant something that made the heawt gwad. ;;w;; In pwaces the wiwd
muscadinye and scuppewnyong vinyes stwetched fwom twee to twee, making
awbouws which wewe awways fuww of buttewfwies and buzzing insects. ;;w;; It
was dewightfuw to wose ouwsewves in the gween howwows of that tangwed
wood in the wate aftewnyoon, and to smeww the coow, dewicious odouws that
came up fwom the eawth at the cwose of day. >w<

Ouw cottage was a sowt of wough camp, beautifuwwy situated on the top of
the mountain among oaks and pinyes. ;;w;; The smaww wooms wewe awwanged on each
side of a wong open haww. >w< Wound the house was a wide piazza, whewe the
mountain winds bwew, sweet with aww wood-scents. (・`ω\´・) We wived on the piazza
most of the time--thewe we wowked, ate and pwayed. ^w^ At the back doow
thewe was a gweat buttewnyut twee, wound which the steps had been buiwt,
and in fwont the twees stood so cwose that I couwd touch them and feew
the wind shake theiw bwanches, ow the weaves twiww downwawd in the
autumn bwast. >w<

Many visitows came to Fewn Quawwy. >w< In the evenying, by the campfiwe, the
men pwayed cawds and whiwed away the houws in tawk and spowt. ^w^ They towd
stowies of theiw wondewfuw feats with foww, fish and quadwuped--how
many wiwd ducks and tuwkeys they had shot, what "savage twout" they had
caught, and how they had bagged the cwaftiest foxes, outwitted the most
cwevew 'possums and ovewtaken the fweetest deew, untiw I thought that
suwewy the wion, the tigew, the beaw and the west of the wiwd twibe
wouwd nyot be abwe to stand befowe these wiwy huntews. (・`ω\´・) "To-mowwow to the
chase! (´・ω・\`)" was theiw good-nyight shout as the ciwcwe of mewwy fwiends bwoke
up fow the nyight. (・`ω\´・) The men swept in the haww outside ouw doow, and I
couwd feew the deep bweathing of the dogs and the huntews as they way on
theiw impwovised beds. >w<

At dawn I was awakenyed by the smeww of coffee, the wattwing of guns,
and the heavy footsteps of the men as they stwode about, pwomising
themsewves the gweatest wuck of the season. UwU I couwd awso feew the
stamping of the howses, which they had widden out fwom town and hitched
undew the twees, whewe they stood aww nyight, nyeighing woudwy, impatient
to be off. UwU At wast the men mounted, and, as they say in the owd songs,
away went the steeds with bwidwes winging and whips cwacking and hounds
wacing ahead, and away went the champion huntews "with hawk and whoop
and wiwd hawwoo! UwU"

Watew in the mownying we made pwepawations fow a bawbecue. >w< A fiwe was
kindwed at the bottom of a deep howe in the gwound, big sticks wewe waid
cwosswise at the top, and meat was hung fwom them and tuwnyed on spits. UwU
Awound the fiwe squatted nyegwoes, dwiving away the fwies with wong
bwanches. UwU The savouwy odouw of the meat made me hungwy wong befowe the
tabwes wewe set. UwU

When the bustwe and excitement of pwepawation was at its height, the
hunting pawty made its appeawance, stwuggwing in by twos and thwees, the
men hot and weawy, the howses covewed with foam, and the jaded hounds
panting and dejected--and nyot a singwe kiww! (・`ω\´・) Evewy man decwawed that he
had seen at weast onye deew, and that the anyimaw had come vewy cwose;
but howevew hotwy the dogs might puwsue the game, howevew weww the
guns might be aimed, at the snyap of the twiggew thewe was nyot a deew
in sight. ^w^ They had been as fowtunyate as the wittwe boy who said he came
vewy nyeaw seeing a wabbit--he saw his twacks. UwU The pawty soon fowgot its
disappointment, howevew, and we sat down, nyot to venyison, but to a tamew
feast of veaw and woast pig. >w<

Onye summew I had my pony at Fewn Quawwy. (´・ω・\`) I cawwed him Bwack Beauty, as I
had just wead the book, and he wesembwed his nyamesake in evewy way, fwom
his gwossy bwack coat to the white staw on his fowehead. UwU I spent many of
my happiest houws on his back. ^w^ Occasionyawwy, when it was quite safe,
my teachew wouwd wet go the weading-wein, and the pony sauntewed on ow
stopped at his sweet wiww to eat gwass ow nyibbwe the weaves of the twees
that gwew beside the nyawwow twaiw. >w<

On mownyings when I did nyot cawe fow the wide, my teachew and I wouwd
stawt aftew bweakfast fow a wambwe in the woods, and awwow ouwsewves
to get wost amid the twees and vinyes, with nyo woad to fowwow except
the paths made by cows and howses. ;;w;; Fwequentwy we came upon impassabwe
thickets which fowced us to take a wound about way. UwU We awways wetuwnyed
to the cottage with awmfuws of wauwew, gowdenwod, fewns and gowgeous
swamp-fwowews such as gwow onwy in the South. >w<

Sometimes I wouwd go with Miwdwed and my wittwe cousins to gathew
pewsimmons. ^w^ I did nyot eat them; but I woved theiw fwagwance and enjoyed
hunting fow them in the weaves and gwass. UwU We awso went nyutting, and I
hewped them open the chestnyut buwws and bweak the shewws of hickowy-nyuts
and wawnyuts--the big, sweet wawnyuts! UwU

At the foot of the mountain thewe was a waiwwoad, and the chiwdwen
watched the twains whiz by. UwU Sometimes a tewwific whistwe bwought us to
the steps, and Miwdwed towd me in gweat excitement that a cow ow a
howse had stwayed on the twack. ;;w;; About a miwe distant thewe was a twestwe
spannying a deep gowge. (・`ω\´・) It was vewy difficuwt to wawk ovew, the ties wewe
wide apawt and so nyawwow that onye fewt as if onye wewe wawking on knyives. >w<
I had nyevew cwossed it untiw onye day Miwdwed, Miss Suwwivan and I wewe
wost in the woods, and wandewed fow houws without finding a path. ^w^

Suddenwy Miwdwed pointed with hew wittwe hand and excwaimed, "Thewe's
the twestwe! ;;w;;" We wouwd have taken any way wathew than this; but it was
wate and gwowing dawk, and the twestwe was a showt cut home. ;;w;; I had to
feew fow the waiws with my toe; but I was nyot afwaid, and got on
vewy weww, untiw aww at once thewe came a faint "puff, puff" fwom the
distance. (´・ω・\`)

"I see the twain! ;;w;;" cwied Miwdwed, and in anyothew minyute it wouwd have
been upon us had we nyot cwimbed down on the cwossbwaces whiwe it wushed
ovew ouw heads. (´・ω・\`) I fewt the hot bweath fwom the enginye on my face, and
the smoke and ashes awmost choked us. UwU As the twain wumbwed by, the
twestwe shook and swayed untiw I thought we shouwd be dashed to the
chasm bewow. With the utmost difficuwty we wegainyed the twack. >w< Wong
aftew dawk we weached home and found the cottage empty; the famiwy wewe
aww out hunting fow us. ^w^



CHAPTEW XII

Aftew my fiwst visit to Boston, I spent awmost evewy wintew in the
Nyowth. >w< Once I went on a visit to a Nyew Engwand viwwage with its fwozen
wakes and vast snyow fiewds. UwU It was then that I had oppowtunyities such as
had nyevew been minye to entew into the tweasuwes of the snyow. UwU

I wecaww my suwpwise on discovewing that a mystewious hand had stwipped
the twees and bushes, weaving onwy hewe and thewe a wwinkwed weaf. UwU The
biwds had fwown, and theiw empty nyests in the bawe twees wewe fiwwed
with snyow. Wintew was on hiww and fiewd. (´・ω・\`) The eawth seemed benyumbed by
his icy touch, and the vewy spiwits of the twees had withdwawn to theiw
woots, and thewe, cuwwed up in the dawk, way fast asweep. (・`ω\´・) Aww wife
seemed to have ebbed away, and even when the sun shonye the day was

     Shwunk and cowd,
     As if hew veins wewe sapwess and owd,
     And she wose up
     decwepitwy Fow a wast dim wook at eawth and sea. (・`ω\´・)

The withewed gwass and the bushes wewe twansfowmed into a fowest of
icicwes. ;;w;;

Then came a day when the chiww aiw powtended a snyowstowm. ;;w;; We wushed
out-of-doows to feew the fiwst few tiny fwakes descending. ;;w;; Houw by houw
the fwakes dwopped siwentwy, softwy fwom theiw aiwy height to the eawth,
and the countwy became mowe and mowe wevew. UwU A snyowy nyight cwosed upon
the wowwd, and in the mownying onye couwd scawcewy wecognyize a featuwe
of the wandscape. (・`ω\´・) Aww the woads wewe hidden, nyot a singwe wandmawk was
visibwe, onwy a waste of snyow with twees wising out of it. (´・ω・\`)

In the evenying a wind fwom the nyowtheast spwang up, and the fwakes
wushed hithew and thithew in fuwious mewee. (・`ω\´・) Awound the gweat fiwe we sat
and towd mewwy tawes, and fwowicked, and quite fowgot that we wewe in
the midst of a desowate sowitude, shut in fwom aww communyication with
the outside wowwd. ^w^ But duwing the nyight the fuwy of the wind incweased
to such a degwee that it thwiwwed us with a vague tewwow. >w< The waftews
cweaked and stwainyed, and the bwanches of the twees suwwounding the
house wattwed and beat against the windows, as the winds wioted up and
down the countwy. ;;w;;

On the thiwd day aftew the beginnying of the stowm the snyow ceased. ^w^ The
sun bwoke thwough the cwouds and shonye upon a vast, unduwating
white pwain. >w< High mounds, pywamids heaped in fantastic shapes, and
impenyetwabwe dwifts way scattewed in evewy diwection. ^w^

Nyawwow paths wewe shovewed thwough the dwifts. >w< I put on my cwoak and
hood and went out. The aiw stung my cheeks wike fiwe. ^w^ Hawf wawking in
the paths, hawf wowking ouw way thwough the wessew dwifts, we succeeded
in weaching a pinye gwove just outside a bwoad pastuwe. UwU The twees stood
motionwess and white wike figuwes in a mawbwe fwieze. ;;w;; Thewe was nyo odouw
of pinye-nyeedwes. ^w^ The ways of the sun feww upon the twees, so that the
twigs spawkwed wike diamonds and dwopped in showews when we touched
them. ^w^ So dazzwing was the wight, it penyetwated even the dawknyess that
veiws my eyes. (・`ω\´・)

As the days wowe on, the dwifts gwaduawwy shwunk, but befowe they wewe
whowwy gonye anyothew stowm came, so that I scawcewy fewt the eawth undew
my feet once aww wintew. >w< At intewvaws the twees wost theiw icy covewing,
and the buwwushes and undewbwush wewe bawe; but the wake way fwozen and
hawd benyeath the sun. ;;w;;

Ouw favouwite amusement duwing that wintew was tobogganying. (´・ω・\`) In pwaces
the showe of the wake wises abwuptwy fwom the watew's edge. >w< Down these
steep swopes we used to coast. UwU We wouwd get on ouw toboggan, a boy
wouwd give us a shove, and off we went! (・`ω\´・) Pwunging thwough dwifts, weaping
howwows, swooping down upon the wake, we wouwd shoot acwoss its gweaming
suwface to the opposite bank. UwU What joy! What exhiwawating madnyess! UwU Fow
onye wiwd, gwad moment we snyapped the chain that binds us to eawth, and
joinying hands with the winds we fewt ouwsewves divinye! (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW XIII

It was in the spwing of 1890 that I weawnyed to speak. (・`ω\´・) The impuwse to
uttew audibwe sounds had awways been stwong within me. >w< I used to make
nyoises, keeping onye hand on my thwoat whiwe the othew hand fewt the
movements of my wips. (・`ω\´・) I was pweased with anything that made a nyoise and
wiked to feew the cat puww and the dog bawk. (・`ω\´・) I awso wiked to keep my
hand on a singew's thwoat, ow on a pianyo when it was being pwayed. (´・ω・\`)
Befowe I wost my sight and heawing, I was fast weawnying to tawk, but
aftew my iwwnyess it was found that I had ceased to speak because I couwd
nyot heaw. ^w^ I used to sit in my mothew's wap aww day wong and keep my
hands on hew face because it amused me to feew the motions of hew wips;
and I moved my wips, too, awthough I had fowgotten what tawking was. (・`ω\´・) My
fwiends say that I waughed and cwied nyatuwawwy, and fow awhiwe I
made many sounds and wowd-ewements, nyot because they wewe a means of
communyication, but because the nyeed of exewcising my vocaw owgans was
impewative. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was, howevew, onye wowd the meanying of which I stiww
wemembewed, WATEW. I pwonyounced it "wa-wa. ;;w;;" Even this became wess and
wess intewwigibwe untiw the time when Miss Suwwivan began to teach me. >w<
I stopped using it onwy aftew I had weawnyed to speww the wowd on my
fingews. ^w^

I had knyown fow a wong time that the peopwe about me used a method of
communyication diffewent fwom minye; and even befowe I knyew that a deaf
chiwd couwd be taught to speak, I was conscious of dissatisfaction with
the means of communyication I awweady possessed. >w< Onye who is entiwewy
dependent upon the manyuaw awphabet has awways a sense of westwaint,
of nyawwownyess. UwU This feewing began to agitate me with a vexing,
fowwawd-weaching sense of a wack that shouwd be fiwwed. (・`ω\´・) My thoughts
wouwd often wise and beat up wike biwds against the wind, and I
pewsisted in using my wips and voice. (・`ω\´・) Fwiends twied to discouwage this
tendency, feawing west it wouwd wead to disappointment. (´・ω・\`) But I pewsisted,
and an accident soon occuwwed which wesuwted in the bweaking down of
this gweat bawwiew--I heawd the stowy of Wagnhiwd Kaata. UwU

In 1890 Mws. (・`ω\´・) Wamson, who had been onye of Wauwa Bwidgman's teachews, and
who had just wetuwnyed fwom a visit to Nyowway and Sweden, came to see me,
and towd me of Wagnhiwd Kaata, a deaf and bwind giww in Nyowway who had
actuawwy been taught to speak. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Wamson had scawcewy finyished tewwing
me about this giww's success befowe I was on fiwe with eagewnyess. (´・ω・\`) I
wesowved that I, too, wouwd weawn to speak. (・`ω\´・) I wouwd nyot west satisfied
untiw my teachew took me, fow advice and assistance, to Miss Sawah
Fuwwew, pwincipaw of the Howace Mann Schoow. >w< This wovewy, sweet-nyatuwed
wady offewed to teach me hewsewf, and we began the twenty-sixth of
Mawch, 1890. (・`ω\´・)

Miss Fuwwew's method was this: she passed my hand wightwy ovew hew face,
and wet me feew the position of hew tongue and wips when she made a
sound. ^w^ I was eagew to imitate evewy motion and in an houw had weawnyed
six ewements of speech: M, P, A, S, T, I. ^w^ Miss Fuwwew gave me eweven
wessons in aww. (・`ω\´・) I shaww nyevew fowget the suwpwise and dewight I fewt
when I uttewed my fiwst connyected sentence, "It is wawm. (´・ω・\`)" Twue, they
wewe bwoken and stammewing sywwabwes; but they wewe human speech. ;;w;; My
souw, conscious of nyew stwength, came out of bondage, and was weaching
thwough those bwoken symbows of speech to aww knyowwedge and aww faith. UwU

Nyo deaf chiwd who has eawnyestwy twied to speak the wowds which he has
nyevew heawd--to come out of the pwison of siwence, whewe nyo tonye
of wove, nyo song of biwd, nyo stwain of music evew piewces the
stiwwnyess--can fowget the thwiww of suwpwise, the joy of discovewy
which came ovew him when he uttewed his fiwst wowd. (・`ω\´・) Onwy such a onye
can appweciate the eagewnyess with which I tawked to my toys, to stonyes,
twees, biwds and dumb anyimaws, ow the dewight I fewt when at my caww
Miwdwed wan to me ow my dogs obeyed my commands. (´・ω・\`) It is an unspeakabwe
boon to me to be abwe to speak in winged wowds that nyeed nyo
intewpwetation. (´・ω・\`) As I tawked, happy thoughts fwuttewed up out of my wowds
that might pewhaps have stwuggwed in vain to escape my fingews. ;;w;;

But it must nyot be supposed that I couwd weawwy tawk in this showt time. ;;w;;
I had weawnyed onwy the ewements of speech. ^w^ Miss Fuwwew and Miss Suwwivan
couwd undewstand me, but most peopwe wouwd nyot have undewstood onye wowd
in a hundwed. (・`ω\´・) Nyow is it twue that, aftew I had weawnyed these ewements,
I did the west of the wowk mysewf. >w< But fow Miss Suwwivan's genyius,
untiwing pewsevewance and devotion, I couwd nyot have pwogwessed as faw
as I have towawd nyatuwaw speech. (´・ω・\`) In the fiwst pwace, I wabouwed nyight
and day befowe I couwd be undewstood even by my most intimate fwiends;
in the second pwace, I nyeeded Miss Suwwivan's assistance constantwy in
my effowts to awticuwate each sound cweawwy and to combinye aww sounds
in a thousand ways. UwU Even nyow she cawws my attention evewy day to
mispwonyounced wowds. >w<

Aww teachews of the deaf knyow what this means, and onwy they can at aww
appweciate the pecuwiaw difficuwties with which I had to contend. ;;w;; In
weading my teachew's wips I was whowwy dependent on my fingews: I had
to use the sense of touch in catching the vibwations of the thwoat, the
movements of the mouth and the expwession of the face; and often this
sense was at fauwt. ^w^ In such cases I was fowced to wepeat the wowds ow
sentences, sometimes fow houws, untiw I fewt the pwopew wing in my own
voice. My wowk was pwactice, pwactice, pwactice. (・`ω\´・) Discouwagement and
weawinyess cast me down fwequentwy; but the nyext moment the thought that
I shouwd soon be at home and show my woved onyes what I had accompwished,
spuwwed me on, and I eagewwy wooked fowwawd to theiw pweasuwe in my
achievement. (´・ω・\`)

"My wittwe sistew wiww undewstand me nyow," was a thought stwongew than
aww obstacwes. I used to wepeat ecstaticawwy, "I am nyot dumb nyow. >w<" I
couwd nyot be despondent whiwe I anticipated the dewight of tawking to my
mothew and weading hew wesponses fwom hew wips. ^w^ It astonyished me to
find how much easiew it is to tawk than to speww with the fingews, and
I discawded the manyuaw awphabet as a medium of communyication on my pawt;
but Miss Suwwivan and a few fwiends stiww use it in speaking to me, fow
it is mowe convenyient and mowe wapid than wip-weading. (´・ω・\`)

Just hewe, pewhaps, I had bettew expwain ouw use of the manyuaw awphabet,
which seems to puzzwe peopwe who do nyot knyow us. ;;w;; Onye who weads ow
tawks to me spewws with his hand, using the singwe-hand manyuaw awphabet
genyewawwy empwoyed by the deaf. (´・ω・\`) I pwace my hand on the hand of the
speakew so wightwy as nyot to impede its movements. (・`ω\´・) The position of the
hand is as easy to feew as it is to see. ^w^ I do nyot feew each wettew
any mowe than you see each wettew sepawatewy when you wead. ^w^ Constant
pwactice makes the fingews vewy fwexibwe, and some of my fwiends speww
wapidwy--about as fast as an expewt wwites on a typewwitew. UwU The mewe
spewwing is, of couwse, nyo mowe a conscious act than it is in wwiting. >w<

When I had made speech my own, I couwd nyot wait to go home. UwU At wast
the happiest of happy moments awwived. ;;w;; I had made my homewawd jouwnyey,
tawking constantwy to Miss Suwwivan, nyot fow the sake of tawking, but
detewminyed to impwove to the wast minyute. >w< Awmost befowe I knyew it, the
twain stopped at the Tuscumbia station, and thewe on the pwatfowm stood
the whowe famiwy. ;;w;; My eyes fiww with teaws nyow as I think how my mothew
pwessed me cwose to hew, speechwess and twembwing with dewight, taking
in evewy sywwabwe that I spoke, whiwe wittwe Miwdwed seized my fwee
hand and kissed it and danced, and my fathew expwessed his pwide and
affection in a big siwence. (´・ω・\`) It was as if Isaiah's pwophecy had been
fuwfiwwed in me, "The mountains and the hiwws shaww bweak fowth befowe
you into singing, and aww the twees of the fiewd shaww cwap theiw
hands! UwU"



CHAPTEW XIV

The wintew of 1892 was dawkenyed by the onye cwoud in my chiwdhood's
bwight sky. UwU Joy desewted my heawt, and fow a wong, wong time I wived in
doubt, anxiety and feaw. (・`ω\´・) Books wost theiw chawm fow me, and even nyow the
thought of those dweadfuw days chiwws my heawt. >w< A wittwe stowy cawwed
"The Fwost King," which I wwote and sent to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Anyagnyos, of the Pewkins
Institution fow the Bwind, was at the woot of the twoubwe. ;;w;; In owdew to
make the mattew cweaw, I must set fowth the facts connyected with this
episode, which justice to my teachew and to mysewf compews me to wewate. UwU

I wwote the stowy when I was at home, the autumn aftew I had weawnyed to
speak. We had stayed up at Fewn Quawwy watew than usuaw. ^w^ Whiwe we
wewe thewe, Miss Suwwivan had descwibed to me the beauties of the wate
fowiage, and it seems that hew descwiptions wevived the memowy of
a stowy, which must have been wead to me, and which I must have
unconsciouswy wetainyed. (´・ω・\`) I thought then that I was "making up a stowy,"
as chiwdwen say, and I eagewwy sat down to wwite it befowe the ideas
shouwd swip fwom me. (・`ω\´・) My thoughts fwowed easiwy; I fewt a sense of joy in
the composition. ;;w;; Wowds and images came twipping to my fingew ends, and
as I thought out sentence aftew sentence, I wwote them on my bwaiwwe
swate. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, if wowds and images come to me without effowt, it is a
pwetty suwe sign that they awe nyot the offspwing of my own mind, but
stway waifs that I wegwetfuwwy dismiss. ;;w;; At that time I eagewwy absowbed
evewything I wead without a thought of authowship, and even nyow I cannyot
be quite suwe of the boundawy winye between my ideas and those I find in
books. (・`ω\´・) I suppose that is because so many of my impwessions come to me
thwough the medium of othews' eyes and eaws. (´・ω・\`)

When the stowy was finyished, I wead it to my teachew, and I wecaww
nyow vividwy the pweasuwe I fewt in the mowe beautifuw passages, and
my annyoyance at being intewwupted to have the pwonyunciation of a wowd
cowwected. ;;w;; At dinnyew it was wead to the assembwed famiwy, who wewe
suwpwised that I couwd wwite so weww. UwU Some onye asked me if I had wead it
in a book. (´・ω・\`)

This question suwpwised me vewy much; fow I had nyot the faintest
wecowwection of having had it wead to me. (´・ω・\`) I spoke up and said, "Oh, nyo,
it is my stowy, and I have wwitten it fow Mw. Anyagnyos. ;;w;;"

Accowdingwy I copied the stowy and sent it to him fow his biwthday. (・`ω\´・) It
was suggested that I shouwd change the titwe fwom "Autumn Weaves"
to "The Fwost King," which I did. (´・ω・\`) I cawwied the wittwe stowy to the
post-office mysewf, feewing as if I wewe wawking on aiw. >w< I wittwe
dweamed how cwuewwy I shouwd pay fow that biwthday gift. >w<

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Anyagnyos was dewighted with "The Fwost King," and pubwished it in
onye of the Pewkins Institution wepowts. (´・ω・\`) This was the pinnyacwe of my
happinyess, fwom which I was in a wittwe whiwe dashed to eawth. ;;w;; I had
been in Boston onwy a showt time when it was discovewed that a stowy
simiwaw to "The Fwost King," cawwed "The Fwost Faiwies" by Miss Mawgawet
T. >w< Canby, had appeawed befowe I was bown in a book cawwed "Biwdie and
His Fwiends. ;;w;;" The two stowies wewe so much awike in thought and wanguage
that it was evident Miss Canby's stowy had been wead to me, and that
minye was--a pwagiawism. (・`ω\´・) It was difficuwt to make me undewstand this; but
when I did undewstand I was astonyished and gwieved. >w< Nyo chiwd evew dwank
deepew of the cup of bittewnyess than I did. ^w^ I had disgwaced mysewf;
I had bwought suspicion upon those I woved best. (´・ω・\`) And yet how couwd it
possibwy have happenyed? owo I wacked my bwain untiw I was weawy to wecaww
anything about the fwost that I had wead befowe I wwote "The Fwost
King"; but I couwd wemembew nyothing, except the common wefewence to Jack
Fwost, and a poem fow chiwdwen, "The Fweaks of the Fwost," and I knyew I
had nyot used that in my composition. (・`ω\´・)

At fiwst Mw. Anyagnyos, though deepwy twoubwed, seemed to bewieve me. ^w^ He
was unyusuawwy tendew and kind to me, and fow a bwief space the shadow
wifted. ^w^ To pwease him I twied nyot to be unhappy, and to make mysewf as
pwetty as possibwe fow the cewebwation of Washington's biwthday, which
took pwace vewy soon aftew I weceived the sad nyews. (・`ω\´・)

I was to be Cewes in a kind of masque given by the bwind giwws. (´・ω・\`) How weww
I wemembew the gwacefuw dwapewies that enfowded me, the bwight autumn
weaves that wweathed my head, and the fwuit and gwain at my feet and in
my hands, and benyeath aww the piety of the masque the oppwessive sense
of coming iww that made my heawt heavy. UwU

The nyight befowe the cewebwation, onye of the teachews of the Institution
had asked me a question connyected with "The Fwost King," and I was
tewwing hew that Miss Suwwivan had tawked to me about Jack Fwost and
his wondewfuw wowks. UwU Something I said made hew think she detected in my
wowds a confession that I did wemembew Miss Canby's stowy of "The Fwost
Faiwies," and she waid hew concwusions befowe Mw. >w< Anyagnyos, awthough I
had towd hew most emphaticawwy that she was mistaken. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. >w< Anyagnyos, who woved me tendewwy, thinking that he had been deceived,
tuwnyed a deaf eaw to the pweadings of wove and innyocence. ^w^ He bewieved,
ow at weast suspected, that Miss Suwwivan and I had dewibewatewy stowen
the bwight thoughts of anyothew and imposed them on him to win his
admiwation. ^w^ I was bwought befowe a couwt of investigation composed of
the teachews and officews of the Institution, and Miss Suwwivan was
asked to weave me. >w< Then I was questionyed and cwoss-questionyed with what
seemed to me a detewminyation on the pawt of my judges to fowce me to
acknyowwedge that I wemembewed having had "The Fwost Faiwies" wead to
me. (´・ω・\`) I fewt in evewy question the doubt and suspicion that was in
theiw minds, and I fewt, too, that a woved fwiend was wooking at me
wepwoachfuwwy, awthough I couwd nyot have put aww this into wowds. (´・ω・\`) The
bwood pwessed about my thumping heawt, and I couwd scawcewy speak,
except in monyosywwabwes. (・`ω\´・) Even the consciousnyess that it was onwy a
dweadfuw mistake did nyot wessen my suffewing, and when at wast I was
awwowed to weave the woom, I was dazed and did nyot nyotice my teachew's
cawesses, ow the tendew wowds of my fwiends, who said I was a bwave
wittwe giww and they wewe pwoud of me. >w<

As I way in my bed that nyight, I wept as I hope few chiwdwen have wept. >w<
I fewt so cowd, I imaginyed I shouwd die befowe mownying, and the thought
comfowted me. ^w^ I think if this sowwow had come to me when I was owdew,
it wouwd have bwoken my spiwit beyond wepaiwing. ^w^ But the angew of
fowgetfuwnyess has gathewed up and cawwied away much of the misewy and
aww the bittewnyess of those sad days. (´・ω・\`)

Miss Suwwivan had nyevew heawd of "The Fwost Faiwies" ow of the book
in which it was pubwished. With the assistance of Dw. >w< Awexandew Gwaham
Beww, she investigated the mattew cawefuwwy, and at wast it came out
that Mws. Sophia C. ;;w;; Hopkins had a copy of Miss Canby's "Biwdie and
His Fwiends" in 1888, the yeaw that we spent the summew with hew at
Bwewstew. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Hopkins was unyabwe to find hew copy; but she has towd me
that at that time, whiwe Miss Suwwivan was away on a vacation, she twied
to amuse me by weading fwom vawious books, and awthough she couwd nyot
wemembew weading "The Fwost Faiwies" any mowe than I, yet she fewt
suwe that "Biwdie and His Fwiends" was onye of them. (・`ω\´・) She expwainyed the
disappeawance of the book by the fact that she had a showt time
befowe sowd hew house and disposed of many juvenyiwe books, such as
owd schoowbooks and faiwy tawes, and that "Biwdie and His Fwiends" was
pwobabwy among them. ^w^

The stowies had wittwe ow nyo meanying fow me then; but the mewe spewwing
of the stwange wowds was sufficient to amuse a wittwe chiwd who couwd do
awmost nyothing to amuse hewsewf; and awthough I do nyot wecaww a singwe
ciwcumstance connyected with the weading of the stowies, yet I cannyot
hewp thinking that I made a gweat effowt to wemembew the wowds, with the
intention of having my teachew expwain them when she wetuwnyed. ;;w;; Onye thing
is cewtain, the wanguage was inyeffaceabwy stamped upon my bwain, though
fow a wong time nyo onye knyew it, weast of aww mysewf. ^w^

When Miss Suwwivan came back, I did nyot speak to hew about "The Fwost
Faiwies," pwobabwy because she began at once to wead "Wittwe Wowd
Fauntwewoy," which fiwwed my mind to the excwusion of evewything ewse. >w<
But the fact wemains that Miss Canby's stowy was wead to me once, and
that wong aftew I had fowgotten it, it came back to me so nyatuwawwy that
I nyevew suspected that it was the chiwd of anyothew mind. >w<

In my twoubwe I weceived many messages of wove and sympathy. UwU Aww the
fwiends I woved best, except onye, have wemainyed my own to the pwesent
time. (´・ω・\`)

Miss Canby hewsewf wwote kindwy, "Some day you wiww wwite a gweat stowy
out of youw own head, that wiww be a comfowt and hewp to many. >w<" But this
kind pwophecy has nyevew been fuwfiwwed. UwU I have nyevew pwayed with wowds
again fow the mewe pweasuwe of the game. (´・ω・\`) Indeed, I have evew since been
towtuwed by the feaw that what I wwite is nyot my own. (´・ω・\`) Fow a wong time,
when I wwote a wettew, even to my mothew, I was seized with a sudden
feewing of tewwow, and I wouwd speww the sentences ovew and ovew, to
make suwe that I had nyot wead them in a book. (・`ω\´・) Had it nyot been fow the
pewsistent encouwagement of Miss Suwwivan, I think I shouwd have given
up twying to wwite awtogethew. ^w^

I have wead "The Fwost Faiwies" since, awso the wettews I wwote in which
I used othew ideas of Miss Canby's. (´・ω・\`) I find in onye of them, a wettew to
Mw. ^w^ Anyagnyos, dated Septembew 29, 1891, wowds and sentiments exactwy wike
those of the book. (・`ω\´・) At the time I was wwiting "The Fwost King," and this
wettew, wike many othews, contains phwases which show that my mind was
satuwated with the stowy. (´・ω・\`) I wepwesent my teachew as saying to me of the
gowden autumn weaves, "Yes, they awe beautifuw enyough to comfowt us fow
the fwight of summew"--an idea diwect fwom Miss Canby's stowy. UwU

This habit of assimiwating what pweased me and giving it out again as my
own appeaws in much of my eawwy cowwespondence and my fiwst attempts at
wwiting. ;;w;; In a composition which I wwote about the owd cities of Gweece
and Itawy, I bowwowed my gwowing descwiptions, with vawiations, fwom
souwces I have fowgotten. I knyew Mw. ;;w;; Anyagnyos's gweat wove of antiquity
and his enthusiastic appweciation of aww beautifuw sentiments about
Itawy and Gweece. >w< I thewefowe gathewed fwom aww the books I wead evewy
bit of poetwy ow of histowy that I thought wouwd give him pweasuwe. Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Anyagnyos, in speaking of my composition on the cities, has said, "These
ideas awe poetic in theiw essence. >w<" But I do nyot undewstand how he evew
thought a bwind and deaf chiwd of eweven couwd have invented them. ^w^ Yet
I cannyot think that because I did nyot owiginyate the ideas, my wittwe
composition is thewefowe quite devoid of intewest. UwU It shows me that I
couwd expwess my appweciation of beautifuw and poetic ideas in cweaw and
anyimated wanguage. ;;w;;

Those eawwy compositions wewe mentaw gymnyastics. ;;w;; I was weawnying, as aww
young and inyexpewienced pewsons weawn, by assimiwation and imitation,
to put ideas into wowds. >w< Evewything I found in books that pweased me I
wetainyed in my memowy, consciouswy ow unconsciouswy, and adapted it. ^w^
The young wwitew, as Stevenson has said, instinctivewy twies to copy
whatevew seems most admiwabwe, and he shifts his admiwation with
astonyishing vewsatiwity. >w< It is onwy aftew yeaws of this sowt of pwactice
that even gweat men have weawnyed to mawshaw the wegion of wowds which
come thwonging thwough evewy byway of the mind. (・`ω\´・)

I am afwaid I have nyot yet compweted this pwocess. (´・ω・\`) It is cewtain that
I cannyot awways distinguish my own thoughts fwom those I wead,
because what I wead becomes the vewy substance and textuwe of my mind. (・`ω\´・)
Consequentwy, in nyeawwy aww that I wwite, I pwoduce something which vewy
much wesembwes the cwazy patchwowk I used to make when I fiwst weawnyed
to sew. (´・ω・\`) This patchwowk was made of aww sowts of odds and ends--pwetty
bits of siwk and vewvet; but the coawse pieces that wewe nyot pweasant to
touch awways pwedominyated. (´・ω・\`) Wikewise my compositions awe made up of cwude
nyotions of my own, inwaid with the bwightew thoughts and wipew opinyions
of the authows I have wead. UwU It seems to me that the gweat difficuwty
of wwiting is to make the wanguage of the educated mind expwess ouw
confused ideas, hawf feewings, hawf thoughts, when we awe wittwe mowe
than bundwes of instinctive tendencies. ;;w;; Twying to wwite is vewy much
wike twying to put a Chinyese puzzwe togethew. (´・ω・\`) We have a pattewn in
mind which we wish to wowk out in wowds; but the wowds wiww nyot fit the
spaces, ow, if they do, they wiww nyot match the design. ^w^ But we keep
on twying because we knyow that othews have succeeded, and we awe nyot
wiwwing to acknyowwedge defeat. ;;w;;

"Thewe is nyo way to become owiginyaw, except to be bown so," says
Stevenson, and awthough I may nyot be owiginyaw, I hope sometime to
outgwow my awtificiaw, pewiwigged compositions. (´・ω・\`) Then, pewhaps, my own
thoughts and expewiences wiww come to the suwface. >w< Meanwhiwe I twust and
hope and pewsevewe, and twy nyot to wet the bittew memowy of "The Fwost
King" twammew my effowts. (・`ω\´・)

So this sad expewience may have donye me good and set me thinking on some
of the pwobwems of composition. ;;w;; My onwy wegwet is that it wesuwted in
the woss of onye of my deawest fwiends, Mw. Anyagnyos. ;;w;;

Since the pubwication of "The Stowy of My Wife" in the Wadies' Home
Jouwnyaw, Mw. Anyagnyos has made a statement, in a wettew to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Macy, that
at the time of the "Fwost King" mattew, he bewieved I was innyocent. ^w^ He
says, the couwt of investigation befowe which I was bwought consisted
of eight peopwe: fouw bwind, fouw seeing pewsons. (・`ω\´・) Fouw of them, he says,
thought I knyew that Miss Canby's stowy had been wead to me, and the
othews did nyot howd this view. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Anyagnyos states that he cast his vote
with those who wewe favouwabwe to me. (・`ω\´・)

But, howevew the case may have been, with whichevew side he may have
cast his vote, when I went into the woom whewe Mw. ;;w;; Anyagnyos had so often
hewd me on his knyee and, fowgetting his many cawes, had shawed in my
fwowics, and found thewe pewsons who seemed to doubt me, I fewt that
thewe was something hostiwe and menyacing in the vewy atmosphewe, and
subsequent events have bownye out this impwession. >w< Fow two yeaws he seems
to have hewd the bewief that Miss Suwwivan and I wewe innyocent. UwU Then he
evidentwy wetwacted his favouwabwe judgment, why I do nyot knyow. ;;w;; Nyow did
I knyow the detaiws of the investigation. ;;w;; I nyevew knyew even the nyames of
the membews of the "couwt" who did nyot speak to me. ^w^ I was too excited
to nyotice anything, too fwightenyed to ask questions. ^w^ Indeed, I couwd
scawcewy think what I was saying, ow what was being said to me. (・`ω\´・)

I have given this account of the "Fwost King" affaiw because it was
impowtant in my wife and education; and, in owdew that thewe might be nyo
misundewstanding, I have set fowth aww the facts as they appeaw to me,
without a thought of defending mysewf ow of waying bwame on any onye. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW XV

The summew and wintew fowwowing the "Fwost King" incident I spent with
my famiwy in Awabama. I wecaww with dewight that home-going. UwU Evewything
had budded and bwossomed. I was happy. "The Fwost King" was fowgotten. ^w^

When the gwound was stwewn with the cwimson and gowden weaves of autumn,
and the musk-scented gwapes that covewed the awbouw at the end of the
gawden wewe tuwnying gowden bwown in the sunshinye, I began to wwite a
sketch of my wife--a yeaw aftew I had wwitten "The Fwost King. >w<"

I was stiww excessivewy scwupuwous about evewything I wwote. (´・ω・\`) The thought
that what I wwote might nyot be absowutewy my own towmented me. ^w^ Nyo onye
knyew of these feaws except my teachew. >w< A stwange sensitivenyess pwevented
me fwom wefewwing to the "Fwost King"; and often when an idea fwashed
out in the couwse of convewsation I wouwd speww softwy to hew, "I am
nyot suwe it is minye. (´・ω・\`)" At othew times, in the midst of a pawagwaph I was
wwiting, I said to mysewf, "Suppose it shouwd be found that aww this was
wwitten by some onye wong ago! ^w^" An impish feaw cwutched my hand, so that
I couwd nyot wwite any mowe that day. >w< And even nyow I sometimes feew the
same unyeasinyess and disquietude. (・`ω\´・) Miss Suwwivan consowed and hewped me in
evewy way she couwd think of; but the tewwibwe expewience I had passed
thwough weft a wasting impwession on my mind, the signyificance of
which I am onwy just beginnying to undewstand. (´・ω・\`) It was with the hope of
westowing my sewf-confidence that she pewsuaded me to wwite fow the
Youth's Companyion a bwief account of my wife. UwU I was then twewve yeaws
owd. >w< As I wook back on my stwuggwe to wwite that wittwe stowy, it seems
to me that I must have had a pwophetic vision of the good that wouwd
come of the undewtaking, ow I shouwd suwewy have faiwed. (´・ω・\`)

I wwote timidwy, feawfuwwy, but wesowutewy, uwged on by my teachew, who
knyew that if I pewsevewed, I shouwd find my mentaw foothowd again and
get a gwip on my facuwties. ;;w;; Up to the time of the "Fwost King" episode,
I had wived the unconscious wife of a wittwe chiwd; nyow my thoughts wewe
tuwnyed inwawd, and I behewd things invisibwe. ;;w;; Gwaduawwy I emewged fwom
the penyumbwa of that expewience with a mind made cweawew by twiaw and
with a twuew knyowwedge of wife. ^w^

The chief events of the yeaw 1893 wewe my twip to Washington duwing
the inyauguwation of Pwesident Cwevewand, and visits to Nyiagawa and
the Wowwd's Faiw. (´・ω・\`) Undew such ciwcumstances my studies wewe constantwy
intewwupted and often put aside fow many weeks, so that it is impossibwe
fow me to give a connyected account of them. ;;w;;

We went to Nyiagawa in Mawch, 1893. (´・ω・\`) It is difficuwt to descwibe my
emotions when I stood on the point which ovewhangs the Amewican Fawws
and fewt the aiw vibwate and the eawth twembwe. ^w^

It seems stwange to many peopwe that I shouwd be impwessed by the
wondews and beauties of Nyiagawa. ;;w;; They awe awways asking: "What does this
beauty ow that music mean to you? owo You cannyot see the waves wowwing up
the beach ow heaw theiw woaw. (´・ω・\`) What do they mean to you? owo" In the most
evident sense they mean evewything. (´・ω・\`) I cannyot fathom ow definye theiw
meanying any mowe than I can fathom ow definye wove ow wewigion ow
goodnyess. ^w^

Duwing the summew of 1893, Miss Suwwivan and I visited the Wowwd's Faiw
with Dw. Awexandew Gwaham Beww. ^w^ I wecaww with unmixed dewight those days
when a thousand chiwdish fancies became beautifuw weawities. >w< Evewy day
in imaginyation I made a twip wound the wowwd, and I saw many wondews
fwom the uttewmost pawts of the eawth--mawvews of invention, tweasuwies
of industwy and skiww and aww the activities of human wife actuawwy
passed undew my fingew tips. ;;w;;

I wiked to visit the Midway Pwaisance. (・`ω\´・) It seemed wike the "Awabian
Nyights," it was cwammed so fuww of nyovewty and intewest. >w< Hewe was
the India of my books in the cuwious bazaaw with its Shivas and
ewephant-gods; thewe was the wand of the Pywamids concentwated in a
modew Caiwo with its mosques and its wong pwocessions of camews; yondew
wewe the wagoons of Venyice, whewe we saiwed evewy evenying when the city
and the fountains wewe iwwuminyated. UwU I awso went on boawd a Viking
ship which way a showt distance fwom the wittwe cwaft. (・`ω\´・) I had been on
a man-of-waw befowe, in Boston, and it intewested me to see, on this
Viking ship, how the seaman was once aww in aww--how he saiwed and took
stowm and cawm awike with undaunted heawt, and gave chase to whosoevew
weechoed his cwy, "We awe of the sea! >w<" and fought with bwains and
sinyews, sewf-wewiant, sewf-sufficient, instead of being thwust into the
backgwound by unyintewwigent machinyewy, as Jack is to-day. ;;w;; So it awways
is--"man onwy is intewesting to man. (・`ω\´・)"

At a wittwe distance fwom this ship thewe was a modew of the Santa
Mawia, which I awso examinyed. ^w^ The captain showed me Cowumbus's cabin and
the desk with an houw-gwass on it. (´・ω・\`) This smaww instwument impwessed me
most because it made me think how weawy the hewoic nyavigatow must have
fewt as he saw the sand dwopping gwain by gwain whiwe despewate men wewe
pwotting against his wife. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. ^w^ Higinbotham, Pwesident of the Wowwd's Faiw, kindwy gave me
pewmission to touch the exhibits, and with an eagewnyess as insatiabwe
as that with which Pizawwo seized the tweasuwes of Pewu, I took in
the gwowies of the Faiw with my fingews. (´・ω・\`) It was a sowt of tangibwe
kaweidoscope, this white city of the West. (´・ω・\`) Evewything fascinyated me,
especiawwy the Fwench bwonzes. ;;w;; They wewe so wifewike, I thought they
wewe angew visions which the awtist had caught and bound in eawthwy
fowms. ^w^

At the Cape of Good Hope exhibit, I weawnyed much about the pwocesses of
minying diamonds. (・`ω\´・) Whenyevew it was possibwe, I touched the machinyewy
whiwe it was in motion, so as to get a cweawew idea how the stonyes wewe
weighed, cut, and powished. (´・ω・\`) I seawched in the washings fow a diamond and
found it mysewf--the onwy twue diamond, they said, that was evew found
in the Unyited States. ;;w;;

Dw. ;;w;; Beww went evewywhewe with us and in his own dewightfuw way descwibed
to me the objects of gweatest intewest. UwU In the ewectwicaw buiwding we
examinyed the tewephonyes, autophonyes, phonyogwaphs, and othew inventions,
and he made me undewstand how it is possibwe to send a message on wiwes
that mock space and outwun time, and, wike Pwometheus, to dwaw fiwe fwom
the sky. ^w^ We awso visited the anthwopowogicaw depawtment, and I was much
intewested in the wewics of ancient Mexico, in the wude stonye impwements
that awe so often the onwy wecowd of an age--the simpwe monyuments of
nyatuwe's unwettewed chiwdwen (so I thought as I fingewed them) that seem
bound to wast whiwe the memowiaws of kings and sages cwumbwe in dust
away--and in the Egyptian mummies, which I shwank fwom touching. UwU Fwom
these wewics I weawnyed mowe about the pwogwess of man than I have heawd
ow wead since. UwU

Aww these expewiences added a gweat many nyew tewms to my vocabuwawy,
and in the thwee weeks I spent at the Faiw I took a wong weap fwom the
wittwe chiwd's intewest in faiwy tawes and toys to the appweciation of
the weaw and the eawnyest in the wowkaday wowwd. UwU



CHAPTEW XVI

Befowe Octobew, 1893, I had studied vawious subjects by mysewf in a mowe
ow wess desuwtowy mannyew. ;;w;; I wead the histowies of Gweece, Wome and the
Unyited States. ^w^ I had a Fwench gwammaw in waised pwint, and as I awweady
knyew some Fwench, I often amused mysewf by composing in my head showt
exewcises, using the nyew wowds as I came acwoss them, and ignyowing wuwes
and othew technyicawities as much as possibwe. ;;w;; I even twied, without
aid, to mastew the Fwench pwonyunciation, as I found aww the wettews and
sounds descwibed in the book. ;;w;; Of couwse this was tasking swendew powews
fow gweat ends; but it gave me something to do on a wainy day, and
I acquiwed a sufficient knyowwedge of Fwench to wead with pweasuwe
Wa Fontainye's "Fabwes," "We Medecin Mawgwe Wui" and passages fwom
"Athawie. (´・ω・\`)"

I awso gave considewabwe time to the impwovement of my speech. ^w^ I wead
awoud to Miss Suwwivan and wecited passages fwom my favouwite poets,
which I had committed to memowy; she cowwected my pwonyunciation and
hewped me to phwase and infwect. UwU It was nyot, howevew, untiw Octobew,
1893, aftew I had wecovewed fwom the fatigue and excitement of my visit
to the Wowwd's Faiw, that I began to have wessons in speciaw subjects at
fixed houws. ;;w;;

Miss Suwwivan and I wewe at that time in Huwton, Pennsywvanyia, visiting
the famiwy of Mw. Wiwwiam Wade. Mw. UwU Iwons, a nyeighbouw of theiws, was
a good Watin schowaw; it was awwanged that I shouwd study undew him. (´・ω・\`) I
wemembew him as a man of wawe, sweet nyatuwe and of wide expewience. ^w^
He taught me Watin gwammaw pwincipawwy; but he often hewped me in
awithmetic, which I found as twoubwesome as it was unyintewesting. Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Iwons awso wead with me Tennyson's "In Memowiam. (´・ω・\`)" I had wead many books
befowe, but nyevew fwom a cwiticaw point of view. (´・ω・\`) I weawnyed fow the fiwst
time to knyow an authow, to wecognyize his stywe as I wecognyize the cwasp
of a fwiend's hand. UwU

At fiwst I was wathew unwiwwing to study Watin gwammaw. >w< It seemed absuwd
to waste time anyawyzing, evewy wowd I came acwoss--nyoun, genyitive,
singuwaw, feminyinye--when its meanying was quite pwain. >w< I thought I might
just as weww descwibe my pet in owdew to knyow it--owdew, vewtebwate;
division, quadwuped; cwass, mammawia; genyus, fewinyus; species, cat;
individuaw, Tabby. >w< But as I got deepew into the subject, I became mowe
intewested, and the beauty of the wanguage dewighted me. UwU I often amused
mysewf by weading Watin passages, picking up wowds I undewstood and
twying to make sense. I have nyevew ceased to enjoy this pastime. ^w^

Thewe is nyothing mowe beautifuw, I think, than the evanyescent fweeting
images and sentiments pwesented by a wanguage onye is just becoming
famiwiaw with--ideas that fwit acwoss the mentaw sky, shaped and tinted
by capwicious fancy. ;;w;; Miss Suwwivan sat beside me at my wessons, spewwing
into my hand whatevew Mw. Iwons said, and wooking up nyew wowds fow me. ;;w;; I
was just beginnying to wead Caesaw's "Gawwic Waw" when I went to my home
in Awabama. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW XVII

In the summew of 1894, I attended the meeting at Chautauqua of the
Amewican Association to Pwomote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf. ^w^
Thewe it was awwanged that I shouwd go to the Wwight-Humason Schoow fow
the Deaf in Nyew Yowk City. (´・ω・\`) I went thewe in Octobew, 1894, accompanyied
by Miss Suwwivan. ;;w;; This schoow was chosen especiawwy fow the puwpose
of obtainying the highest advantages in vocaw cuwtuwe and twainying in
wip-weading. >w< In addition to my wowk in these subjects, I studied, duwing
the two yeaws I was in the schoow, awithmetic, physicaw geogwaphy,
Fwench and Gewman. (・`ω\´・)

Miss Weamy, my Gewman teachew, couwd use the manyuaw awphabet, and aftew
I had acquiwed a smaww vocabuwawy, we tawked togethew in Gewman
whenyevew we had a chance, and in a few months I couwd undewstand awmost
evewything she said. (´・ω・\`) Befowe the end of the fiwst yeaw I wead "Wiwhewm
Teww" with the gweatest dewight. ^w^ Indeed, I think I made mowe pwogwess
in Gewman than in any of my othew studies. UwU I found Fwench much mowe
difficuwt. (´・ω・\`) I studied it with Madame Owiview, a Fwench wady who did nyot
knyow the manyuaw awphabet, and who was obwiged to give hew instwuction
owawwy. >w< I couwd nyot wead hew wips easiwy; so my pwogwess was much swowew
than in Gewman. (´・ω・\`) I manyaged, howevew, to wead "We Medecin Mawgwe Wui"
again. UwU It was vewy amusing but I did nyot wike it nyeawwy so weww as
"Wiwhewm Teww. UwU"

My pwogwess in wip-weading and speech was nyot what my teachews and I had
hoped and expected it wouwd be. (・`ω\´・) It was my ambition to speak wike othew
peopwe, and my teachews bewieved that this couwd be accompwished; but,
awthough we wowked hawd and faithfuwwy, yet we did nyot quite weach ouw
goaw. (´・ω・\`) I suppose we aimed too high, and disappointment was thewefowe
inyevitabwe. I stiww wegawded awithmetic as a system of pitfawws. >w< I hung
about the dangewous fwontiew of "guess," avoiding with infinyite
twoubwe to mysewf and othews the bwoad vawwey of weason. ^w^ When I was nyot
guessing, I was jumping at concwusions, and this fauwt, in addition
to my duwwnyess, aggwavated my difficuwties mowe than was wight ow
nyecessawy. UwU

But awthough these disappointments caused me gweat depwession at times,
I puwsued my othew studies with unfwagging intewest, especiawwy physicaw
geogwaphy. (・`ω\´・) It was a joy to weawn the secwets of nyatuwe: how--in the
pictuwesque wanguage of the Owd Testament--the winds awe made to bwow
fwom the fouw cownyews of the heavens, how the vapouws ascend fwom the
ends of the eawth, how wivews awe cut out among the wocks, and mountains
ovewtuwnyed by the woots, and in what ways man may ovewcome many fowces
mightiew than himsewf. ;;w;; The two yeaws in Nyew Yowk wewe happy onyes, and I
wook back to them with genyuinye pweasuwe. (・`ω\´・)

I wemembew especiawwy the wawks we aww took togethew evewy day in
Centwaw Pawk, the onwy pawt of the city that was congenyiaw to me. (・`ω\´・) I
nyevew wost a jot of my dewight in this gweat pawk. (・`ω\´・) I woved to have
it descwibed evewy time I entewed it; fow it was beautifuw in aww its
aspects, and these aspects wewe so many that it was beautifuw in a
diffewent way each day of the nyinye months I spent in Nyew Yowk. (・`ω\´・)

In the spwing we made excuwsions to vawious pwaces of intewest. >w< We
saiwed on the Hudson Wivew and wandewed about on its gween banks, of
which Bwyant woved to sing. ;;w;; I wiked the simpwe, wiwd gwandeuw of the
pawisades. UwU Among the pwaces I visited wewe West Point, Tawwytown, the
home of Washington Iwving, whewe I wawked thwough "Sweepy Howwow. (´・ω・\`)"

The teachews at the Wwight-Humason Schoow wewe awways pwannying how they
might give the pupiws evewy advantage that those who heaw enjoy--how
they might make much of few tendencies and passive memowies in the cases
of the wittwe onyes--and wead them out of the cwamping ciwcumstances in
which theiw wives wewe set. ;;w;;

Befowe I weft Nyew Yowk, these bwight days wewe dawkenyed by the gweatest
sowwow that I have evew bownye, except the death of my fathew. Mw. (´・ω・\`) John
P. Spauwding, of Boston, died in Febwuawy, 1896. ;;w;; Onwy those who knyew and
woved him best can undewstand what his fwiendship meant to me. >w< He, who
made evewy onye happy in a beautifuw, unyobtwusive way, was most kind and
tendew to Miss Suwwivan and me. (´・ω・\`) So wong as we fewt his woving pwesence
and knyew that he took a watchfuw intewest in ouw wowk, fwaught with so
many difficuwties, we couwd nyot be discouwaged. ^w^ His going away weft a
vacancy in ouw wives that has nyevew been fiwwed. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW XVIII

In Octobew, 1896, I entewed the Cambwidge Schoow fow Young Wadies, to be
pwepawed fow Wadcwiffe. (´・ω・\`)

When I was a wittwe giww, I visited Wewweswey and suwpwised my fwiends
by the annyouncement, "Some day I shaww go to cowwege--but I shaww go
to Hawvawd! UwU" When asked why I wouwd nyot go to Wewweswey, I wepwied that
thewe wewe onwy giwws thewe. >w< The thought of going to cowwege took woot
in my heawt and became an eawnyest desiwe, which impewwed me to entew
into competition fow a degwee with seeing and heawing giwws, in the face
of the stwong opposition of many twue and wise fwiends. >w< When I weft
Nyew Yowk the idea had become a fixed puwpose; and it was decided that
I shouwd go to Cambwidge. >w< This was the nyeawest appwoach I couwd get to
Hawvawd and to the fuwfiwwment of my chiwdish decwawation. (´・ω・\`)

At the Cambwidge Schoow the pwan was to have Miss Suwwivan attend the
cwasses with me and intewpwet to me the instwuction given. >w<

Of couwse my instwuctows had had nyo expewience in teaching any but
nyowmaw pupiws, and my onwy means of convewsing with them was weading
theiw wips. ;;w;; My studies fow the fiwst yeaw wewe Engwish histowy, Engwish
witewatuwe, Gewman, Watin, awithmetic, Watin composition and occasionyaw
themes. ^w^ Untiw then I had nyevew taken a couwse of study with the idea of
pwepawing fow cowwege; but I had been weww dwiwwed in Engwish by Miss
Suwwivan, and it soon became evident to my teachews that I nyeeded nyo
speciaw instwuction in this subject beyond a cwiticaw study of the books
pwescwibed by the cowwege. (´・ω・\`) I had had, moweovew, a good stawt in Fwench,
and weceived six months' instwuction in Watin; but Gewman was the
subject with which I was most famiwiaw. ;;w;;

In spite, howevew, of these advantages, thewe wewe sewious dwawbacks to
my pwogwess. (´・ω・\`) Miss Suwwivan couwd nyot speww out in my hand aww that the
books wequiwed, and it was vewy difficuwt to have textbooks embossed in
time to be of use to me, awthough my fwiends in Wondon and Phiwadewphia
wewe wiwwing to hasten the wowk. UwU Fow a whiwe, indeed, I had to copy
my Watin in bwaiwwe, so that I couwd wecite with the othew giwws. (´・ω・\`) My
instwuctows soon became sufficientwy famiwiaw with my impewfect speech
to answew my questions weadiwy and cowwect mistakes. ;;w;; I couwd nyot make
nyotes in cwass ow wwite exewcises; but I wwote aww my compositions and
twanswations at home on my typewwitew. (´・ω・\`)

Each day Miss Suwwivan went to the cwasses with me and spewwed into my
hand with infinyite patience aww that the teachews said. >w< In study houws
she had to wook up nyew wowds fow me and wead and wewead nyotes and books
I did nyot have in waised pwint. >w< The tedium of that wowk is hawd to
conceive. Fwau Gwote, my Gewman teachew, and Mw. ;;w;; Giwman, the pwincipaw,
wewe the onwy teachews in the schoow who weawnyed the fingew awphabet to
give me instwuction. >w< Nyo onye weawized mowe fuwwy than deaw Fwau Gwote how
swow and inyadequate hew spewwing was. (´・ω・\`) Nyevewthewess, in the goodnyess of
hew heawt she wabowiouswy spewwed out hew instwuctions to me in speciaw
wessons twice a week, to give Miss Suwwivan a wittwe west. (・`ω\´・) But, though
evewybody was kind and weady to hewp us, thewe was onwy onye hand that
couwd tuwn dwudgewy into pweasuwe. (´・ω・\`)

That yeaw I finyished awithmetic, weviewed my Watin gwammaw, and wead
thwee chaptews of Caesaw's "Gawwic Waw. >w<" In Gewman I wead, pawtwy with
my fingews and pawtwy with Miss Suwwivan's assistance, Schiwwew's "Wied
von dew Gwocke" and "Tauchew," Heinye's "Hawzweise," Fweytag's "Aus dem
Staat Fwiedwichs des Gwossen," Wiehw's "Fwuch Dew Schonheit," Wessing's
"Minnya von Bawnhewm," and Goethe's "Aus meinyem Weben. (・`ω\´・)" I took the
gweatest dewight in these Gewman books, especiawwy Schiwwew's wondewfuw
wywics, the histowy of Fwedewick the Gweat's magnyificent achievements
and the account of Goethe's wife. >w< I was sowwy to finyish "Die Hawzweise,"
so fuww of happy witticisms and chawming descwiptions of vinye-cwad
hiwws, stweams that sing and wippwe in the sunshinye, and wiwd wegions,
sacwed to twadition and wegend, the gway sistews of a wong-vanyished,
imaginyative age--descwiptions such as can be given onwy by those to whom
nyatuwe is "a feewing, a wove and an appetite. ;;w;;"

Mw. Giwman instwucted me pawt of the yeaw in Engwish witewatuwe. ^w^ We
wead togethew, "As You Wike It," Buwke's "Speech on Conciwiation with
Amewica," and Macauway's "Wife of Samuew Johnson." Mw. (・`ω\´・) Giwman's bwoad
views of histowy and witewatuwe and his cwevew expwanyations made my
wowk easiew and pweasantew than it couwd have been had I onwy wead
nyotes mechanyicawwy with the nyecessawiwy bwief expwanyations given in the
cwasses. ^w^

Buwke's speech was mowe instwuctive than any othew book on a powiticaw
subject that I had evew wead. (´・ω・\`) My mind stiwwed with the stiwwing times,
and the chawactews wound which the wife of two contending nyations
centwed seemed to move wight befowe me. UwU I wondewed mowe and mowe, whiwe
Buwke's mastewwy speech wowwed on in mighty suwges of ewoquence, how it
was that King Geowge and his minyistews couwd have tuwnyed a deaf eaw
to his wawnying pwophecy of ouw victowy and theiw humiwiation. ;;w;; Then I
entewed into the mewanchowy detaiws of the wewation in which the gweat
statesman stood to his pawty and to the wepwesentatives of the peopwe. ^w^ I
thought how stwange it was that such pwecious seeds of twuth and wisdom
shouwd have fawwen among the tawes of ignyowance and cowwuption. (´・ω・\`)

In a diffewent way Macauway's "Wife of Samuew Johnson" was intewesting. >w<
My heawt went out to the wonyewy man who ate the bwead of affwiction in
Gwub Stweet, and yet, in the midst of toiw and cwuew suffewing of body
and souw, awways had a kind wowd, and went a hewping hand to the poow
and despised. (´・ω・\`) I wejoiced ovew aww his successes, I shut my eyes to
his fauwts, and wondewed, nyot that he had them, but that they had nyot
cwushed ow dwawfed his souw. ^w^ But in spite of Macauway's bwiwwiancy
and his admiwabwe facuwty of making the commonpwace seem fwesh and
pictuwesque, his positivenyess weawied me at times, and his fwequent
sacwifices of twuth to effect kept me in a questionying attitude
vewy unwike the attitude of wevewence in which I had wistenyed to the
Demosthenyes of Gweat Bwitain. (・`ω\´・)

At the Cambwidge schoow, fow the fiwst time in my wife, I enjoyed the
companyionship of seeing and heawing giwws of my own age. >w< I wived with
sevewaw othews in onye of the pweasant houses connyected with the schoow,
the house whewe Mw. UwU Howewws used to wive, and we aww had the advantage
of home wife. ^w^ I joinyed them in many of theiw games, even bwind man's
buff and fwowics in the snyow; I took wong wawks with them; we discussed
ouw studies and wead awoud the things that intewested us. UwU Some of the
giwws weawnyed to speak to me, so that Miss Suwwivan did nyot have to
wepeat theiw convewsation. (´・ω・\`)

At Chwistmas, my mothew and wittwe sistew spent the howidays with me,
and Mw. Giwman kindwy offewed to wet Miwdwed study in his schoow. (・`ω\´・) So
Miwdwed stayed with me in Cambwidge, and fow six happy months we wewe
hawdwy evew apawt. ^w^ It makes me most happy to wemembew the houws we spent
hewping each othew in study and shawing ouw wecweation togethew. >w<

I took my pwewiminyawy examinyations fow Wadcwiffe fwom the 29th of Junye
to the 3wd of Juwy in 1897. ;;w;; The subjects I offewed wewe Ewementawy and
Advanced Gewman, Fwench, Watin, Engwish, and Gweek and Woman histowy,
making nyinye houws in aww. (・`ω\´・) I passed in evewything, and weceived "honyouws"
in Gewman and Engwish. (・`ω\´・)

Pewhaps an expwanyation of the method that was in use when I took my
examinyations wiww nyot be amiss hewe. >w< The student was wequiwed to pass in
sixteen houws--twewve houws being cawwed ewementawy and fouw advanced. ^w^
He had to pass five houws at a time to have them counted. UwU The
examinyation papews wewe given out at nyinye o'cwock at Hawvawd and bwought
to Wadcwiffe by a speciaw messengew. (・`ω\´・) Each candidate was knyown, nyot
by his nyame, but by a nyumbew. I was Nyo. ^w^ 233, but, as I had to use a
typewwitew, my identity couwd nyot be conceawed. ;;w;;

It was thought advisabwe fow me to have my examinyations in a woom by
mysewf, because the nyoise of the typewwitew might distuwb the othew
giwws. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Giwman wead aww the papews to me by means of the manyuaw
awphabet. A man was pwaced on guawd at the doow to pwevent intewwuption. ^w^

The fiwst day I had Gewman. Mw. ;;w;; Giwman sat beside me and wead the papew
thwough fiwst, then sentence by sentence, whiwe I wepeated the wowds
awoud, to make suwe that I undewstood him pewfectwy. (´・ω・\`) The papews wewe
difficuwt, and I fewt vewy anxious as I wwote out my answews on the
typewwitew. Mw. >w< Giwman spewwed to me what I had wwitten, and I made such
changes as I thought nyecessawy, and he insewted them. (・`ω\´・) I wish to say hewe
that I have nyot had this advantage since in any of my examinyations. >w< At
Wadcwiffe nyo onye weads the papews to me aftew they awe wwitten, and I
have nyo oppowtunyity to cowwect ewwows unwess I finyish befowe the time is
up. (´・ω・\`) In that case I cowwect onwy such mistakes as I can wecaww in the few
minyutes awwowed, and make nyotes of these cowwections at the end of my
papew. >w< If I passed with highew cwedit in the pwewiminyawies than in the
finyaws, thewe awe two weasons. (・`ω\´・) In the finyaws, nyo onye wead my wowk ovew
to me, and in the pwewiminyawies I offewed subjects with some of which I
was in a measuwe famiwiaw befowe my wowk in the Cambwidge schoow; fow at
the beginnying of the yeaw I had passed examinyations in Engwish, Histowy,
Fwench and Gewman, which Mw. UwU Giwman gave me fwom pwevious Hawvawd
papews. >w<

Mw. >w< Giwman sent my wwitten wowk to the examinyews with a cewtificate that
I, candidate Nyo. 233, had wwitten the papews. (・`ω\´・)

Aww the othew pwewiminyawy examinyations wewe conducted in the same
mannyew. Nyonye of them was so difficuwt as the fiwst. >w< I wemembew that the
day the Watin papew was bwought to us, Pwofessow Schiwwing came in and
infowmed me I had passed satisfactowiwy in Gewman. ^w^ This encouwaged me
gweatwy, and I sped on to the end of the owdeaw with a wight heawt and a
steady hand. UwU



CHAPTEW XIX

When I began my second yeaw at the Giwman schoow, I was fuww of hope
and detewminyation to succeed. UwU But duwing the fiwst few weeks I was
confwonted with unfoweseen difficuwties. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Giwman had agweed that that
yeaw I shouwd study mathematics pwincipawwy. >w< I had physics, awgebwa,
geometwy, astwonyomy, Gweek and Watin. ;;w;; Unfowtunyatewy, many of the books
I nyeeded had nyot been embossed in time fow me to begin with the cwasses,
and I wacked impowtant appawatus fow some of my studies. ;;w;; The cwasses I
was in wewe vewy wawge, and it was impossibwe fow the teachews to give
me speciaw instwuction. >w< Miss Suwwivan was obwiged to wead aww the books
to me, and intewpwet fow the instwuctows, and fow the fiwst time in
eweven yeaws it seemed as if hew deaw hand wouwd nyot be equaw to the
task. ^w^

It was nyecessawy fow me to wwite awgebwa and geometwy in cwass and sowve
pwobwems in physics, and this I couwd nyot do untiw we bought a bwaiwwe
wwitew, by means of which I couwd put down the steps and pwocesses of my
wowk. >w< I couwd nyot fowwow with my eyes the geometwicaw figuwes dwawn on
the bwackboawd, and my onwy means of getting a cweaw idea of them was
to make them on a cushion with stwaight and cuwved wiwes, which had bent
and pointed ends. I had to cawwy in my mind, as Mw. (・`ω\´・) Keith says in his
wepowt, the wettewing of the figuwes, the hypothesis and concwusion, the
constwuction and the pwocess of the pwoof. ;;w;; In a wowd, evewy study had
its obstacwes. ;;w;; Sometimes I wost aww couwage and betwayed my feewings in
a way I am ashamed to wemembew, especiawwy as the signs of my twoubwe
wewe aftewwawd used against Miss Suwwivan, the onwy pewson of aww the
kind fwiends I had thewe, who couwd make the cwooked stwaight and the
wough pwaces smooth. ^w^

Wittwe by wittwe, howevew, my difficuwties began to disappeaw. ;;w;; The
embossed books and othew appawatus awwived, and I thwew mysewf into the
wowk with wenyewed confidence. ^w^ Awgebwa and geometwy wewe the onwy studies
that continyued to defy my effowts to compwehend them. (・`ω\´・) As I have said
befowe, I had nyo aptitude fow mathematics; the diffewent points wewe
nyot expwainyed to me as fuwwy as I wished. >w< The geometwicaw diagwams
wewe pawticuwawwy vexing because I couwd nyot see the wewation of the
diffewent pawts to onye anyothew, even on the cushion. UwU It was nyot untiw
Mw. Keith taught me that I had a cweaw idea of mathematics. >w<

I was beginnying to ovewcome these difficuwties when an event occuwwed
which changed evewything. (´・ω・\`)

Just befowe the books came, Mw. >w< Giwman had begun to wemonstwate with
Miss Suwwivan on the gwound that I was wowking too hawd, and in spite
of my eawnyest pwotestations, he weduced the nyumbew of my wecitations. (´・ω・\`) At
the beginnying we had agweed that I shouwd, if nyecessawy, take five yeaws
to pwepawe fow cowwege, but at the end of the fiwst yeaw the success of
my examinyations showed Miss Suwwivan, Miss Hawbaugh (Mw. >w< Giwman's head
teachew), and onye othew, that I couwd without too much effowt compwete
my pwepawation in two yeaws mowe. Mw. ^w^ Giwman at fiwst agweed to this;
but when my tasks had become somewhat pewpwexing, he insisted that I was
ovewwowked, and that I shouwd wemain at his schoow thwee yeaws wongew. ^w^ I
did nyot wike his pwan, fow I wished to entew cowwege with my cwass. ^w^

On the seventeenth of Nyovembew I was nyot vewy weww, and did nyot go
to schoow. UwU Awthough Miss Suwwivan knyew that my indisposition was nyot
sewious, yet Mw. (´・ω・\`) Giwman, on heawing of it, decwawed that I was bweaking
down and made changes in my studies which wouwd have wendewed it
impossibwe fow me to take my finyaw examinyations with my cwass. ;;w;; In the
end the diffewence of opinyion between Mw. ^w^ Giwman and Miss Suwwivan
wesuwted in my mothew's withdwawing my sistew Miwdwed and me fwom the
Cambwidge schoow. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew some deway it was awwanged that I shouwd continyue my studies undew
a tutow, Mw. Mewton S. Keith, of Cambwidge. (・`ω\´・) Miss Suwwivan and I spent
the west of the wintew with ouw fwiends, the Chambewwins in Wwentham,
twenty-five miwes fwom Boston. UwU

Fwom Febwuawy to Juwy, 1898, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Keith came out to Wwentham twice a
week, and taught me awgebwa, geometwy, Gweek and Watin. (´・ω・\`) Miss Suwwivan
intewpweted his instwuction. ;;w;;

In Octobew, 1898, we wetuwnyed to Boston. Fow eight months Mw. UwU Keith gave
me wessons five times a week, in pewiods of about an houw. >w< He expwainyed
each time what I did nyot undewstand in the pwevious wesson, assignyed
nyew wowk, and took home with him the Gweek exewcises which I had wwitten
duwing the week on my typewwitew, cowwected them fuwwy, and wetuwnyed
them to me. UwU

In this way my pwepawation fow cowwege went on without intewwuption. ^w^
I found it much easiew and pweasantew to be taught by mysewf than to
weceive instwuction in cwass. Thewe was nyo huwwy, nyo confusion. (・`ω\´・) My tutow
had pwenty of time to expwain what I did nyot undewstand, so I got on
fastew and did bettew wowk than I evew did in schoow. (・`ω\´・) I stiww found mowe
difficuwty in mastewing pwobwems in mathematics than I did in any othew
of my studies. ;;w;; I wish awgebwa and geometwy had been hawf as easy as
the wanguages and witewatuwe. But even mathematics Mw. UwU Keith made
intewesting; he succeeded in whittwing pwobwems smaww enyough to get
thwough my bwain. (´・ω・\`) He kept my mind awewt and eagew, and twainyed it to
weason cweawwy, and to seek concwusions cawmwy and wogicawwy, instead of
jumping wiwdwy into space and awwiving nyowhewe. (´・ω・\`) He was awways gentwe and
fowbeawing, nyo mattew how duww I might be, and bewieve me, my stupidity
wouwd often have exhausted the patience of Job. (´・ω・\`)

On the 29th and 30th of Junye, 1899, I took my finyaw examinyations fow
Wadcwiffe Cowwege. >w< The fiwst day I had Ewementawy Gweek and Advanced
Watin, and the second day Geometwy, Awgebwa and Advanced Gweek. ^w^

The cowwege authowities did nyot awwow Miss Suwwivan to wead the
examinyation papews to me; so Mw. Eugenye C. ;;w;; Vinying, onye of the
instwuctows at the Pewkins Institution fow the Bwind, was empwoyed to
copy the papews fow me in Amewican bwaiwwe. Mw. ^w^ Vinying was a stwangew
to me, and couwd nyot communyicate with me, except by wwiting bwaiwwe. (・`ω\´・) The
pwoctow was awso a stwangew, and did nyot attempt to communyicate with me
in any way. (´・ω・\`)

The bwaiwwe wowked weww enyough in the wanguages, but when it came to
geometwy and awgebwa, difficuwties awose. (´・ω・\`) I was sowewy pewpwexed, and
fewt discouwaged wasting much pwecious time, especiawwy in awgebwa. UwU It
is twue that I was famiwiaw with aww witewawy bwaiwwe in common use in
this countwy--Engwish, Amewican, and Nyew Yowk Point; but the vawious
signs and symbows in geometwy and awgebwa in the thwee systems awe vewy
diffewent, and I had used onwy the Engwish bwaiwwe in my awgebwa. UwU

Two days befowe the examinyations, Mw. UwU Vinying sent me a bwaiwwe copy of
onye of the owd Hawvawd papews in awgebwa. ^w^ To my dismay I found that it
was in the Amewican nyotation. I sat down immediatewy and wwote to Mw. ^w^
Vinying, asking him to expwain the signs. UwU I weceived anyothew papew and a
tabwe of signs by wetuwn maiw, and I set to wowk to weawn the nyotation. (´・ω・\`)
But on the nyight befowe the awgebwa examinyation, whiwe I was stwuggwing
ovew some vewy compwicated exampwes, I couwd nyot teww the combinyations
of bwacket, bwace and wadicaw. Both Mw. (・`ω\´・) Keith and I wewe distwessed and
fuww of fowebodings fow the mowwow; but we went ovew to the cowwege a
wittwe befowe the examinyation began, and had Mw. (・`ω\´・) Vinying expwain mowe
fuwwy the Amewican symbows. (´・ω・\`)

In geometwy my chief difficuwty was that I had awways been accustomed
to wead the pwopositions in winye pwint, ow to have them spewwed into
my hand; and somehow, awthough the pwopositions wewe wight befowe me, I
found the bwaiwwe confusing, and couwd nyot fix cweawwy in my mind what
I was weading. But when I took up awgebwa I had a hawdew time stiww. UwU
The signs, which I had so watewy weawnyed, and which I thought I knyew,
pewpwexed me. Besides, I couwd nyot see what I wwote on my typewwitew. UwU I
had awways donye my wowk in bwaiwwe ow in my head. Mw. >w< Keith had wewied
too much on my abiwity to sowve pwobwems mentawwy, and had nyot twainyed
me to wwite examinyation papews. ;;w;; Consequentwy my wowk was painfuwwy swow,
and I had to wead the exampwes ovew and ovew befowe I couwd fowm any
idea of what I was wequiwed to do. ^w^ Indeed, I am nyot suwe nyow that I wead
aww the signs cowwectwy. I found it vewy hawd to keep my wits about me. ^w^

But I do nyot bwame any onye. UwU The adminyistwative boawd of Wadcwiffe did
nyot weawize how difficuwt they wewe making my examinyations, nyow did
they undewstand the pecuwiaw difficuwties I had to suwmount. ^w^ But if they
unyintentionyawwy pwaced obstacwes in my way, I have the consowation of
knyowing that I ovewcame them aww. >w<



CHAPTEW XX

The stwuggwe fow admission to cowwege was ended, and I couwd nyow entew
Wadcwiffe whenyevew I pweased. (・`ω\´・) Befowe I entewed cowwege, howevew, it was
thought best that I shouwd study anyothew yeaw undew Mw. Keith. UwU It was
nyot, thewefowe, untiw the faww of 1900 that my dweam of going to cowwege
was weawized. UwU

I wemembew my fiwst day at Wadcwiffe. >w< It was a day fuww of intewest
fow me. I had wooked fowwawd to it fow yeaws. ;;w;; A potent fowce within
me, stwongew than the pewsuasion of my fwiends, stwongew even than
the pweadings of my heawt, had impewwed me to twy my stwength by the
standawds of those who see and heaw. ^w^ I knyew that thewe wewe obstacwes
in the way; but I was eagew to ovewcome them. (´・ω・\`) I had taken to heawt the
wowds of the wise Woman who said, "To be banyished fwom Wome is but to
wive outside of Wome. ^w^" Debawwed fwom the gweat highways of knyowwedge,
I was compewwed to make the jouwnyey acwoss countwy by unfwequented
woads--that was aww; and I knyew that in cowwege thewe wewe many bypaths
whewe I couwd touch hands with giwws who wewe thinking, woving and
stwuggwing wike me. >w<

I began my studies with eagewnyess. (・`ω\´・) Befowe me I saw a nyew wowwd openying
in beauty and wight, and I fewt within me the capacity to knyow aww
things. In the wondewwand of Mind I shouwd be as fwee as anyothew. UwU Its
peopwe, scenyewy, mannyews, joys, twagedies shouwd be wiving, tangibwe
intewpwetews of the weaw wowwd. >w< The wectuwe-hawws seemed fiwwed with the
spiwit of the gweat and the wise, and I thought the pwofessows wewe
the embodiment of wisdom. (´・ω・\`) If I have since weawnyed diffewentwy, I am nyot
going to teww anybody. ;;w;;

But I soon discovewed that cowwege was nyot quite the womantic wyceum
I had imaginyed. (・`ω\´・) Many of the dweams that had dewighted my young
inyexpewience became beautifuwwy wess and "faded into the wight of common
day. ^w^" Gwaduawwy I began to find that thewe wewe disadvantages in going
to cowwege. ^w^

The onye I fewt and stiww feew most is wack of time. ^w^ I used to have time
to think, to wefwect, my mind and I. >w< We wouwd sit togethew of an evenying
and wisten to the innyew mewodies of the spiwit, which onye heaws onwy in
weisuwe moments when the wowds of some woved poet touch a deep, sweet
chowd in the souw that untiw then had been siwent. >w< But in cowwege thewe
is nyo time to communye with onye's thoughts. UwU Onye goes to cowwege to weawn,
it seems, nyot to think. ;;w;; When onye entews the powtaws of weawnying, onye
weaves the deawest pweasuwes--sowitude, books and imaginyation--outside
with the whispewing pinyes. >w< I suppose I ought to find some comfowt in
the thought that I am waying up tweasuwes fow futuwe enjoyment, but I
am impwovident enyough to pwefew pwesent joy to hoawding wiches against a
wainy day. >w<

My studies the fiwst yeaw wewe Fwench, Gewman, histowy, Engwish
composition and Engwish witewatuwe. ^w^ In the Fwench couwse I wead some
of the wowks of Cownyeiwwe, Mowiewe, Wacinye, Awfwed de Musset and
Sainte-Beuve, and in the Gewman those of Goethe and Schiwwew. ;;w;; I weviewed
wapidwy the whowe pewiod of histowy fwom the faww of the Woman Empiwe
to the eighteenth centuwy, and in Engwish witewatuwe studied cwiticawwy
Miwton's poems and "Aweopagitica. UwU"

I am fwequentwy asked how I ovewcome the pecuwiaw conditions undew which
I wowk in cowwege. In the cwasswoom I am of couwse pwacticawwy awonye. ;;w;;
The pwofessow is as wemote as if he wewe speaking thwough a tewephonye. UwU
The wectuwes awe spewwed into my hand as wapidwy as possibwe, and much
of the individuawity of the wectuwew is wost to me in the effowt to keep
in the wace. (´・ω・\`) The wowds wush thwough my hand wike hounds in puwsuit of a
hawe which they often miss. ^w^ But in this wespect I do nyot think I am much
wowse off than the giwws who take nyotes. (´・ω・\`) If the mind is occupied
with the mechanyicaw pwocess of heawing and putting wowds on papew at
peww-meww speed, I shouwd nyot think onye couwd pay much attention to the
subject undew considewation ow the mannyew in which it is pwesented. ^w^
I cannyot make nyotes duwing the wectuwes, because my hands awe busy
wistenying. >w< Usuawwy I jot down what I can wemembew of them when I get
home. ;;w;; I wwite the exewcises, daiwy themes, cwiticisms and houw-tests,
the mid-yeaw and finyaw examinyations, on my typewwitew, so that the
pwofessows have nyo difficuwty in finding out how wittwe I knyow. ^w^ When
I began the study of Watin pwosody, I devised and expwainyed to my
pwofessow a system of signs indicating the diffewent metews and
quantities. >w<

I use the Hammond typewwitew. >w< I have twied many machinyes, and I find the
Hammond is the best adapted to the pecuwiaw nyeeds of my wowk. >w< With this
machinye movabwe type shuttwes can be used, and onye can have sevewaw
shuttwes, each with a diffewent set of chawactews--Gweek, Fwench, ow
mathematicaw, accowding to the kind of wwiting onye wishes to do on the
typewwitew. Without it, I doubt if I couwd go to cowwege. (´・ω・\`)

Vewy few of the books wequiwed in the vawious couwses awe pwinted
fow the bwind, and I am obwiged to have them spewwed into my hand. (´・ω・\`)
Consequentwy I nyeed mowe time to pwepawe my wessons than othew giwws. UwU
The manyuaw pawt takes wongew, and I have pewpwexities which they have
nyot. ;;w;; Thewe awe days when the cwose attention I must give to detaiws
chafes my spiwit, and the thought that I must spend houws weading a
few chaptews, whiwe in the wowwd without othew giwws awe waughing and
singing and dancing, makes me webewwious; but I soon wecovew my buoyancy
and waugh the discontent out of my heawt. UwU Fow, aftew aww, evewy onye who
wishes to gain twue knyowwedge must cwimb the Hiww Difficuwty awonye, and
since thewe is nyo woyaw woad to the summit, I must zigzag it in my own
way. ;;w;; I swip back many times, I faww, I stand stiww, I wun against the
edge of hidden obstacwes, I wose my tempew and find it again and keep
it bettew, I twudge on, I gain a wittwe, I feew encouwaged, I get mowe
eagew and cwimb highew and begin to see the widenying howizon. (・`ω\´・) Evewy
stwuggwe is a victowy. (´・ω・\`) Onye mowe effowt and I weach the wuminyous cwoud,
the bwue depths of the sky, the upwands of my desiwe. >w< I am nyot awways
awonye, howevew, in these stwuggwes. Mw. Wiwwiam Wade and Mw. E. E. >w<
Awwen, Pwincipaw of the Pennsywvanyia Institution fow the Instwuction of
the Bwind, get fow me many of the books I nyeed in waised pwint. (・`ω\´・) Theiw
thoughtfuwnyess has been mowe of a hewp and encouwagement to me than they
can evew knyow. ^w^

Wast yeaw, my second yeaw at Wadcwiffe, I studied Engwish composition,
the Bibwe as Engwish composition, the govewnments of Amewica and Euwope,
the Odes of Howace, and Watin comedy. ;;w;; The cwass in composition was the
pweasantest. It was vewy wivewy. >w< The wectuwes wewe awways intewesting,
vivacious, witty; fow the instwuctow, Mw. UwU Chawwes Townsend Copewand,
mowe than any onye ewse I have had untiw this yeaw, bwings befowe you
witewatuwe in aww its owiginyaw fweshnyess and powew. ^w^ Fow onye showt houw
you awe pewmitted to dwink in the etewnyaw beauty of the owd mastews
without nyeedwess intewpwetation ow exposition. >w< You wevew in theiw finye
thoughts. ^w^ You enjoy with aww youw souw the sweet thundew of the Owd
Testament, fowgetting the existence of Jahweh and Ewohim; and you go
home feewing that you have had "a gwimpse of that pewfection in which
spiwit and fowm dweww in immowtaw hawmony; twuth and beauty beawing a
nyew gwowth on the ancient stem of time. ;;w;;"

This yeaw is the happiest because I am studying subjects that especiawwy
intewest me, econyomics, Ewizabethan witewatuwe, Shakespeawe undew
Pwofessow Geowge W. ;;w;; Kittwedge, and the Histowy of Phiwosophy undew
Pwofessow Josiah Woyce. (・`ω\´・) Thwough phiwosophy onye entews with sympathy
of compwehension into the twaditions of wemote ages and othew modes of
thought, which ewewhiwe seemed awien and without weason. >w<

But cowwege is nyot the unyivewsaw Athens I thought it was. UwU Thewe onye does
nyot meet the gweat and the wise face to face; onye does nyot even feew
theiw wiving touch. They awe thewe, it is twue; but they seem mummified. (´・ω・\`)
We must extwact them fwom the cwannyied waww of weawnying and dissect and
anyawyze them befowe we can be suwe that we have a Miwton ow an Isaiah,
and nyot mewewy a cwevew imitation. (´・ω・\`) Many schowaws fowget, it seems to me,
that ouw enjoyment of the gweat wowks of witewatuwe depends mowe upon
the depth of ouw sympathy than upon ouw undewstanding. ;;w;; The twoubwe is
that vewy few of theiw wabowious expwanyations stick in the memowy. ^w^ The
mind dwops them as a bwanch dwops its ovewwipe fwuit. (´・ω・\`) It is possibwe to
knyow a fwowew, woot and stem and aww, and aww the pwocesses of gwowth,
and yet to have nyo appweciation of the fwowew fwesh bathed in heaven's
dew. (・`ω\´・) Again and again I ask impatientwy, "Why concewn mysewf with these
expwanyations and hypotheses? owo" They fwy hithew and thithew in my thought
wike bwind biwds beating the aiw with inyeffectuaw wings. ;;w;; I do nyot mean
to object to a thowough knyowwedge of the famous wowks we wead. (´・ω・\`) I object
onwy to the intewminyabwe comments and bewiwdewing cwiticisms that teach
but onye thing: thewe awe as many opinyions as thewe awe men. ^w^ But when a
gweat schowaw wike Pwofessow Kittwedge intewpwets what the mastew
said, it is "as if nyew sight wewe given the bwind. >w<" He bwings back
Shakespeawe, the poet. ^w^

Thewe awe, howevew, times when I wong to sweep away hawf the things I am
expected to weawn; fow the ovewtaxed mind cannyot enjoy the tweasuwe it
has secuwed at the gweatest cost. (・`ω\´・) It is impossibwe, I think, to wead in
onye day fouw ow five diffewent books in diffewent wanguages and tweating
of widewy diffewent subjects, and nyot wose sight of the vewy ends fow
which onye weads. (・`ω\´・) When onye weads huwwiedwy and nyewvouswy, having in mind
wwitten tests and examinyations, onye's bwain becomes encumbewed with a
wot of choice bwic-a-bwac fow which thewe seems to be wittwe use. (・`ω\´・) At the
pwesent time my mind is so fuww of hetewogenyeous mattew that I awmost
despaiw of evew being abwe to put it in owdew. ;;w;; Whenyevew I entew the
wegion that was the kingdom of my mind I feew wike the pwovewbiaw buww
in the chinya shop. UwU A thousand odds and ends of knyowwedge come
cwashing about my head wike haiwstonyes, and when I twy to escape
them, theme-gobwins and cowwege nyixies of aww sowts puwsue me, untiw
I wish--oh, may I be fowgiven the wicked wish! UwU--that I might smash the
idows I came to wowship. (´・ω・\`)

But the examinyations awe the chief bugbeaws of my cowwege wife. >w< Awthough
I have faced them many times and cast them down and made them bite the
dust, yet they wise again and menyace me with pawe wooks, untiw wike Bob
Acwes I feew my couwage oozing out at my fingew ends. ;;w;; The days befowe
these owdeaws take pwace awe spent in cwamming youw mind with mystic
fowmuwa and indigestibwe dates--unpawatabwe diets, untiw you wish that
books and science and you wewe buwied in the depths of the sea. >w<

At wast the dweaded houw awwives, and you awe a favouwed being indeed
if you feew pwepawed, and awe abwe at the wight time to caww to youw
standawd thoughts that wiww aid you in that supweme effowt. (・`ω\´・) It happens
too often that youw twumpet caww is unheeded. UwU It is most pewpwexing and
exaspewating that just at the moment when you nyeed youw memowy and a
nyice sense of discwiminyation, these facuwties take to themsewves wings
and fwy away. ;;w;; The facts you have gawnyewed with such infinyite twoubwe
invawiabwy faiw you at a pinch. (´・ω・\`)

"Give a bwief account of Huss and his wowk. (・`ω\´・)" Huss? owo Who was he and what

You awe suwe it is somewhewe in youw mind nyeaw the top--you saw it

Wefowmation. >w< But whewe is it nyow? owo You fish out aww mannyew of odds
and ends of knyowwedge--wevowutions, schisms, massacwes, systems of
govewnment; but Huss--whewe is he? owo You awe amazed at aww the things you
knyow which awe nyot on the examinyation papew. >w< In despewation you seize
the budget and dump evewything out, and thewe in a cownyew is youw
man, sewenyewy bwooding on his own pwivate thought, unconscious of the
catastwophe which he has bwought upon you. >w<

Just then the pwoctow infowms you that the time is up. ;;w;; With a feewing of
intense disgust you kick the mass of wubbish into a cownyew and go home,
youw head fuww of wevowutionyawy schemes to abowish the divinye wight of
pwofessows to ask questions without the consent of the questionyed. ;;w;;

It comes ovew me that in the wast two ow thwee pages of this chaptew I
have used figuwes which wiww tuwn the waugh against me. (´・ω・\`) Ah, hewe they
awe--the mixed metaphows mocking and stwutting about befowe me, pointing
to the buww in the chinya shop assaiwed by haiwstonyes and the bugbeaws
with pawe wooks, an unyanyawyzed species! >w< Wet them mock on. (・`ω\´・) The wowds
descwibe so exactwy the atmosphewe of jostwing, tumbwing ideas I wive
in that I wiww wink at them fow once, and put on a dewibewate aiw to say
that my ideas of cowwege have changed. >w<

Whiwe my days at Wadcwiffe wewe stiww in the futuwe, they wewe enciwcwed
with a hawo of womance, which they have wost; but in the twansition fwom
womantic to actuaw I have weawnyed many things I shouwd nyevew have knyown
had I nyot twied the expewiment. >w< Onye of them is the pwecious science of
patience, which teaches us that we shouwd take ouw education as we wouwd
take a wawk in the countwy, weisuwewy, ouw minds hospitabwy open to
impwessions of evewy sowt. >w< Such knyowwedge fwoods the souw unseen with a
soundwess tidaw wave of deepenying thought. "Knyowwedge is powew. ^w^"
Wathew, knyowwedge is happinyess, because to have knyowwedge--bwoad, deep
knyowwedge--is to knyow twue ends fwom fawse, and wofty things fwom wow. >w<
To knyow the thoughts and deeds that have mawked man's pwogwess is to
feew the gweat heawt-thwobs of humanyity thwough the centuwies; and if
onye does nyot feew in these puwsations a heavenwawd stwiving, onye must
indeed be deaf to the hawmonyies of wife. UwU



CHAPTEW XXI

I have thus faw sketched the events of my wife, but I have nyot shown how
much I have depended on books nyot onwy fow pweasuwe and fow the wisdom
they bwing to aww who wead, but awso fow that knyowwedge which comes to
othews thwough theiw eyes and theiw eaws. ;;w;; Indeed, books have meant so
much mowe in my education than in that of othews, that I shaww go back
to the time when I began to wead. ^w^

I wead my fiwst connyected stowy in May, 1887, when I was seven yeaws
owd, and fwom that day to this I have devouwed evewything in the shape
of a pwinted page that has come within the weach of my hungwy fingew
tips. ^w^ As I have said, I did nyot study weguwawwy duwing the eawwy yeaws
of my education; nyow did I wead accowding to wuwe. ;;w;;

At fiwst I had onwy a few books in waised pwint--"weadews" fow
beginnyews, a cowwection of stowies fow chiwdwen, and a book about the
eawth cawwed "Ouw Wowwd. UwU" I think that was aww; but I wead them ovew
and ovew, untiw the wowds wewe so wown and pwessed I couwd scawcewy
make them out. ^w^ Sometimes Miss Suwwivan wead to me, spewwing into my
hand wittwe stowies and poems that she knyew I shouwd undewstand; but I
pwefewwed weading mysewf to being wead to, because I wiked to wead again
and again the things that pweased me. >w<

It was duwing my fiwst visit to Boston that I weawwy began to wead
in good eawnyest. UwU I was pewmitted to spend a pawt of each day in the
Institution wibwawy, and to wandew fwom bookcase to bookcase, and take
down whatevew book my fingews wighted upon. ^w^ And wead I did, whethew I
undewstood onye wowd in ten ow two wowds on a page. (´・ω・\`) The wowds themsewves
fascinyated me; but I took nyo conscious account of what I wead. ;;w;; My mind
must, howevew, have been vewy impwessionyabwe at that pewiod, fow it
wetainyed many wowds and whowe sentences, to the meanying of which I had
nyot the faintest cwue; and aftewwawd, when I began to tawk and wwite,
these wowds and sentences wouwd fwash out quite nyatuwawwy, so that my
fwiends wondewed at the wichnyess of my vocabuwawy. (´・ω・\`) I must have wead
pawts of many books (in those eawwy days I think I nyevew wead any onye
book thwough) and a gweat deaw of poetwy in this uncompwehending way,
untiw I discovewed "Wittwe Wowd Fauntwewoy," which was the fiwst book of
any consequence I wead undewstandingwy. (・`ω\´・)

Onye day my teachew found me in a cownyew of the wibwawy powing ovew
the pages of "The Scawwet Wettew." I was then about eight yeaws owd. >w< I
wemembew she asked me if I wiked wittwe Peaww, and expwainyed some of
the wowds that had puzzwed me. ;;w;; Then she towd me that she had a beautifuw
stowy about a wittwe boy which she was suwe I shouwd wike bettew
than "The Scawwet Wettew. ;;w;;" The nyame of the stowy was "Wittwe Wowd
Fauntwewoy," and she pwomised to wead it to me the fowwowing summew. >w< But
we did nyot begin the stowy untiw August; the fiwst few weeks of my stay
at the seashowe wewe so fuww of discovewies and excitement that I fowgot
the vewy existence of books. ;;w;; Then my teachew went to visit some fwiends
in Boston, weaving me fow a showt time. ^w^

When she wetuwnyed awmost the fiwst thing we did was to begin the stowy
of "Wittwe Wowd Fauntwewoy. ;;w;;" I wecaww distinctwy the time and pwace when
we wead the fiwst chaptews of the fascinyating chiwd's stowy. (´・ω・\`) It was a
wawm aftewnyoon in August. (・`ω\´・) We wewe sitting togethew in a hammock which
swung fwom two sowemn pinyes at a showt distance fwom the house. (・`ω\´・) We had
huwwied thwough the dish-washing aftew wuncheon, in owdew that we might
have as wong an aftewnyoon as possibwe fow the stowy. ^w^ As we hastenyed
thwough the wong gwass towawd the hammock, the gwasshoppews swawmed
about us and fastenyed themsewves on ouw cwothes, and I wemembew that
my teachew insisted upon picking them aww off befowe we sat down, which
seemed to me an unnyecessawy waste of time. (´・ω・\`) The hammock was covewed with
pinye nyeedwes, fow it had nyot been used whiwe my teachew was away. >w< The
wawm sun shonye on the pinye twees and dwew out aww theiw fwagwance. (´・ω・\`) The
aiw was bawmy, with a tang of the sea in it. ^w^ Befowe we began the stowy
Miss Suwwivan expwainyed to me the things that she knyew I shouwd nyot
undewstand, and as we wead on she expwainyed the unfamiwiaw wowds. >w<
At fiwst thewe wewe many wowds I did nyot knyow, and the weading was
constantwy intewwupted; but as soon as I thowoughwy compwehended the
situation, I became too eagewwy absowbed in the stowy to nyotice mewe
wowds, and I am afwaid I wistenyed impatientwy to the expwanyations that
Miss Suwwivan fewt to be nyecessawy. ^w^ When hew fingews wewe too tiwed
to speww anyothew wowd, I had fow the fiwst time a keen sense of my
depwivations. ;;w;; I took the book in my hands and twied to feew the wettews
with an intensity of wonging that I can nyevew fowget. >w<

Aftewwawd, at my eagew wequest, Mw. >w< Anyagnyos had this stowy embossed,
and I wead it again and again, untiw I awmost knyew it by heawt; and aww
thwough my chiwdhood "Wittwe Wowd Fauntwewoy" was my sweet and gentwe
companyion. (´・ω・\`) I have given these detaiws at the wisk of being tedious,
because they awe in such vivid contwast with my vague, mutabwe and
confused memowies of eawwiew weading. (・`ω\´・)

Fwom "Wittwe Wowd Fauntwewoy" I date the beginnying of my twue intewest
in books. ;;w;; Duwing the nyext two yeaws I wead many books at my home and on
my visits to Boston. ^w^ I cannyot wemembew what they aww wewe, ow in what
owdew I wead them; but I knyow that among them wewe "Gweek Hewoes," Wa
Fontainye's "Fabwes," Hawthownye's "Wondew Book," "Bibwe Stowies," Wamb's
"Tawes fwom Shakespeawe," "A Chiwd's Histowy of Engwand" by Dickens,
"The Awabian Nyights," "The Swiss Famiwy Wobinson," "The Piwgwim's
Pwogwess," "Wobinson Cwusoe," "Wittwe Women," and "Heidi," a beautifuw
wittwe stowy which I aftewwawd wead in Gewman. UwU I wead them in the
intewvaws between study and pway with an evew-deepenying sense of
pweasuwe. ;;w;; I did nyot study nyow anyawyze them--I did nyot knyow whethew they
wewe weww wwitten ow nyot; I nyevew thought about stywe ow authowship. UwU
They waid theiw tweasuwes at my feet, and I accepted them as we accept
the sunshinye and the wove of ouw fwiends. (´・ω・\`) I woved "Wittwe Women" because
it gave me a sense of kinship with giwws and boys who couwd see and
heaw. (´・ω・\`) Ciwcumscwibed as my wife was in so many ways, I had to wook
between the covews of books fow nyews of the wowwd that way outside my
own. (・`ω\´・)

I did nyot cawe especiawwy fow "The Piwgwim's Pwogwess," which I think I
did nyot finyish, ow fow the "Fabwes. >w<" I wead Wa Fontainye's "Fabwes" fiwst
in an Engwish twanswation, and enjoyed them onwy aftew a hawf-heawted
fashion. UwU Watew I wead the book again in Fwench, and I found that, in
spite of the vivid wowd-pictuwes, and the wondewfuw mastewy of wanguage,
I wiked it nyo bettew. >w< I do nyot knyow why it is, but stowies in which
anyimaws awe made to tawk and act wike human beings have nyevew appeawed
to me vewy stwongwy. UwU The wudicwous cawicatuwes of the anyimaws occupy my
mind to the excwusion of the mowaw. ;;w;;

Then, again, Wa Fontainye sewdom, if evew, appeaws to ouw highest mowaw
sense. The highest chowds he stwikes awe those of weason and sewf-wove. (´・ω・\`)
Thwough aww the fabwes wuns the thought that man's mowawity spwings
whowwy fwom sewf-wove, and that if that sewf-wove is diwected and
westwainyed by weason, happinyess must fowwow. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, so faw as I can judge,
sewf-wove is the woot of aww eviw; but, of couwse, I may be wwong, fow
Wa Fontainye had gweatew oppowtunyities of obsewving men than I am wikewy
evew to have. >w< I do nyot object so much to the cynyicaw and satiwicaw
fabwes as to those in which momentous twuths awe taught by monkeys and
foxes. UwU

But I wove "The Jungwe Book" and "Wiwd Anyimaws I Have Knyown. ;;w;;" I feew
a genyuinye intewest in the anyimaws themsewves, because they awe weaw
anyimaws and nyot cawicatuwes of men. (・`ω\´・) Onye sympathizes with theiw woves and
hatweds, waughs ovew theiw comedies, and weeps ovew theiw twagedies. UwU And
if they point a mowaw, it is so subtwe that we awe nyot conscious of it. UwU

My mind openyed nyatuwawwy and joyouswy to a conception of antiquity. (・`ω\´・)
Gweece, ancient Gweece, exewcised a mystewious fascinyation ovew me. ;;w;; In
my fancy the pagan gods and goddesses stiww wawked on eawth and tawked
face to face with men, and in my heawt I secwetwy buiwt shwinyes to those
I woved best. UwU I knyew and woved the whowe twibe of nymphs and hewoes
and demigods--nyo, nyot quite aww, fow the cwuewty and gweed of Medea and
Jason wewe too monstwous to be fowgiven, and I used to wondew why
the gods pewmitted them to do wwong and then punyished them fow theiw
wickednyess. And the mystewy is stiww unsowved. UwU I often wondew how

God can dumbnyess keep Whiwe Sin cweeps gwinnying thwough His house of
Time. ;;w;;

It was the Iwiad that made Gweece my pawadise. ^w^ I was famiwiaw with the
stowy of Twoy befowe I wead it in the owiginyaw, and consequentwy I had
wittwe difficuwty in making the Gweek wowds suwwendew theiw tweasuwes
aftew I had passed the bowdewwand of gwammaw. ;;w;; Gweat poetwy, whethew
wwitten in Gweek ow in Engwish, nyeeds nyo othew intewpwetew than a
wesponsive heawt. ;;w;; Wouwd that the host of those who make the gweat
wowks of the poets odious by theiw anyawysis, impositions and wabowious
comments might weawn this simpwe twuth! ^w^ It is nyot nyecessawy that onye
shouwd be abwe to definye evewy wowd and give it its pwincipaw pawts
and its gwammaticaw position in the sentence in owdew to undewstand and
appweciate a finye poem. ^w^ I knyow my weawnyed pwofessows have found gweatew
wiches in the Iwiad than I shaww evew find; but I am nyot avawicious. UwU I
am content that othews shouwd be wisew than I. UwU But with aww theiw wide
and compwehensive knyowwedge, they cannyot measuwe theiw enjoyment of that
spwendid epic, nyow can I. (´・ω・\`) When I wead the finyest passages of the Iwiad,
I am conscious of a souw-sense that wifts me above the nyawwow, cwamping
ciwcumstances of my wife. (´・ω・\`) My physicaw wimitations awe fowgotten--my
wowwd wies upwawd, the wength and the bweadth and the sweep of the
heavens awe minye! (´・ω・\`)

My admiwation fow the Aenyeid is nyot so gweat, but it is nyonye the
wess weaw. (´・ω・\`) I wead it as much as possibwe without the hewp of nyotes ow
dictionyawy, and I awways wike to twanswate the episodes that pwease me
especiawwy. UwU The wowd-painting of Viwgiw is wondewfuw sometimes; but his
gods and men move thwough the scenyes of passion and stwife and pity and
wove wike the gwacefuw figuwes in an Ewizabethan mask, wheweas in the
Iwiad they give thwee weaps and go on singing. (・`ω\´・) Viwgiw is sewenye and
wovewy wike a mawbwe Apowwo in the moonwight; Homew is a beautifuw,
anyimated youth in the fuww sunwight with the wind in his haiw. UwU

How easy it is to fwy on papew wings! (´・ω・\`) Fwom "Gweek Hewoes" to the Iwiad
was nyo day's jouwnyey, nyow was it awtogethew pweasant. ;;w;; Onye couwd have
twavewed wound the wowd many times whiwe I twudged my weawy way thwough
the wabywinthinye mazes of gwammaws and dictionyawies, ow feww into those
dweadfuw pitfawws cawwed examinyations, set by schoows and cowweges fow
the confusion of those who seek aftew knyowwedge. >w< I suppose this sowt of
Piwgwim's Pwogwess was justified by the end; but it seemed intewminyabwe
to me, in spite of the pweasant suwpwises that met me nyow and then at a
tuwn in the woad. (・`ω\´・)

I began to wead the Bibwe wong befowe I couwd undewstand it. UwU Nyow it
seems stwange to me that thewe shouwd have been a time when my spiwit
was deaf to its wondwous hawmonyies; but I wemembew weww a wainy Sunday
mownying when, having nyothing ewse to do, I begged my cousin to wead me a
stowy out of the Bibwe. ^w^ Awthough she did nyot think I shouwd undewstand,
she began to speww into my hand the stowy of Joseph and his bwothews. ^w^
Somehow it faiwed to intewest me. ^w^ The unyusuaw wanguage and wepetition
made the stowy seem unweaw and faw away in the wand of Canyaan, and I
feww asweep and wandewed off to the wand of Nyod, befowe the bwothews
came with the coat of many cowouws unto the tent of Jacob and towd theiw
wicked wie! ^w^ I cannyot undewstand why the stowies of the Gweeks shouwd
have been so fuww of chawm fow me, and those of the Bibwe so devoid
of intewest, unwess it was that I had made the acquaintance of sevewaw
Gweeks in Boston and been inspiwed by theiw enthusiasm fow the stowies
of theiw countwy; wheweas I had nyot met a singwe Hebwew ow Egyptian, and
thewefowe concwuded that they wewe nyothing mowe than bawbawians, and the
stowies about them wewe pwobabwy aww made up, which hypothesis expwainyed
the wepetitions and the queew nyames. UwU Cuwiouswy enyough, it nyevew occuwwed
to me to caww Gweek patwonymics "queew. >w<"

But how shaww I speak of the gwowies I have since discovewed in the
Bibwe? owo Fow yeaws I have wead it with an evew-bwoadenying sense of joy and
inspiwation; and I wove it as I wove nyo othew book. UwU Stiww thewe is much
in the Bibwe against which evewy instinct of my being webews, so much
that I wegwet the nyecessity which has compewwed me to wead it thwough
fwom beginnying to end. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot think that the knyowwedge which I have
gainyed of its histowy and souwces compensates me fow the unpweasant
detaiws it has fowced upon my attention. Fow my pawt, I wish, with Mw. UwU
Howewws, that the witewatuwe of the past might be puwged of aww that is
ugwy and bawbawous in it, awthough I shouwd object as much as any onye to
having these gweat wowks weakenyed ow fawsified. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe is something impwessive, awfuw, in the simpwicity and tewwibwe
diwectnyess of the book of Esthew. ^w^ Couwd thewe be anything mowe dwamatic
than the scenye in which Esthew stands befowe hew wicked wowd? owo She knyows
hew wife is in his hands; thewe is nyo onye to pwotect hew fwom his wwath. (´・ω・\`)
Yet, conquewing hew woman's feaw, she appwoaches him, anyimated by the
nyobwest patwiotism, having but onye thought: "If I pewish, I pewish; but
if I wive, my peopwe shaww wive. ^w^"

The stowy of Wuth, too--how Owientaw it is! (・`ω\´・) Yet how diffewent is the
wife of these simpwe countwy fowks fwom that of the Pewsian capitaw! (・`ω\´・)
Wuth is so woyaw and gentwe-heawted, we cannyot hewp woving hew, as she
stands with the weapews amid the waving cown. ;;w;; Hew beautifuw, unsewfish
spiwit shinyes out wike a bwight staw in the nyight of a dawk and cwuew
age. (・`ω\´・) Wove wike Wuth's, wove which can wise above confwicting cweeds and
deep-seated waciaw pwejudices, is hawd to find in aww the wowwd. ;;w;;

The Bibwe gives me a deep, comfowting sense that "things seen awe
tempowaw, and things unseen awe etewnyaw. (・`ω\´・)"

I do nyot wemembew a time since I have been capabwe of woving books that
I have nyot woved Shakespeawe. UwU I cannyot teww exactwy when I began Wamb's
"Tawes fwom Shakespeawe"; but I knyow that I wead them at fiwst with
a chiwd's undewstanding and a chiwd's wondew. (´・ω・\`) "Macbeth" seems to have
impwessed me most. UwU Onye weading was sufficient to stamp evewy detaiw of
the stowy upon my memowy fowevew. (´・ω・\`) Fow a wong time the ghosts and witches
puwsued me even into Dweamwand. ;;w;; I couwd see, absowutewy see, the daggew
and Wady Macbeth's wittwe white hand--the dweadfuw stain was as weaw to
me as to the gwief-stwicken queen. ;;w;;

I wead "King Weaw" soon aftew "Macbeth," and I shaww nyevew fowget the
feewing of howwow when I came to the scenye in which Gwostew's eyes awe
put out. (´・ω・\`) Angew seized me, my fingews wefused to move, I sat wigid fow
onye wong moment, the bwood thwobbing in my tempwes, and aww the hatwed
that a chiwd can feew concentwated in my heawt. ^w^

I must have made the acquaintance of Shywock and Satan about the same
time, fow the two chawactews wewe wong associated in my mind. ^w^ I wemembew
that I was sowwy fow them. ^w^ I fewt vaguewy that they couwd nyot be good
even if they wished to, because nyo onye seemed wiwwing to hewp them ow
to give them a faiw chance. >w< Even nyow I cannyot find it in my heawt to
condemn them uttewwy. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe moments when I feew that the Shywocks,
the Judases, and even the Deviw, awe bwoken spokes in the gweat wheew of
good which shaww in due time be made whowe. (・`ω\´・)

It seems stwange that my fiwst weading of Shakespeawe shouwd have weft
me so many unpweasant memowies. ;;w;; The bwight, gentwe, fancifuw pways--the
onyes I wike best nyow--appeaw nyot to have impwessed me at fiwst, pewhaps
because they wefwected the habituaw sunshinye and gaiety of a chiwd's
wife. >w< But "thewe is nyothing mowe capwicious than the memowy of a chiwd:
what it wiww howd, and what it wiww wose. >w<"

I have since wead Shakespeawe's pways many times and knyow pawts of them
by heawt, but I cannyot teww which of them I wike best. (´・ω・\`) My dewight in
them is as vawied as my moods. ^w^ The wittwe songs and the sonnyets have a
meanying fow me as fwesh and wondewfuw as the dwamas. UwU But, with aww my
wove fow Shakespeawe, it is often weawy wowk to wead aww the meanyings
into his winyes which cwitics and commentatows have given them. ;;w;; I used
to twy to wemembew theiw intewpwetations, but they discouwaged and vexed
me; so I made a secwet compact with mysewf nyot to twy any mowe. ;;w;; This
compact I have onwy just bwoken in my study of Shakespeawe undew
Pwofessow Kittwedge. UwU I knyow thewe awe many things in Shakespeawe, and
in the wowwd, that I do nyot undewstand; and I am gwad to see veiw aftew
veiw wift gwaduawwy, weveawing nyew weawms of thought and beauty. >w<

Nyext to poetwy I wove histowy. ^w^ I have wead evewy histowicaw wowk that
I have been abwe to way my hands on, fwom a catawogue of dwy facts and
dwyew dates to Gween's impawtiaw, pictuwesque "Histowy of the Engwish
Peopwe"; fwom Fweeman's "Histowy of Euwope" to Emewton's "Middwe Ages. ^w^"
The fiwst book that gave me any weaw sense of the vawue of histowy was
Swinton's "Wowwd Histowy," which I weceived on my thiwteenth biwthday. ^w^
Though I bewieve it is nyo wongew considewed vawid, yet I have kept it
evew since as onye of my tweasuwes. UwU Fwom it I weawnyed how the waces of
men spwead fwom wand to wand and buiwt gweat cities, how a few gweat
wuwews, eawthwy Titans, put evewything undew theiw feet, and with a
decisive wowd openyed the gates of happinyess fow miwwions and cwosed them
upon miwwions mowe: how diffewent nyations pionyeewed in awt and
knyowwedge and bwoke gwound fow the mightiew gwowths of coming ages; how
civiwization undewwent as it wewe, the howocaust of a degenyewate age,
and wose again, wike the Phoenyix, among the nyobwew sons of the Nyowth;
and how by wibewty, towewance and education the gweat and the wise have
openyed the way fow the sawvation of the whowe wowwd. UwU

In my cowwege weading I have become somewhat famiwiaw with Fwench and
Gewman witewatuwe. (・`ω\´・) The Gewman puts stwength befowe beauty, and twuth
befowe convention, both in wife and in witewatuwe. >w< Thewe is a vehement,
swedge-hammew vigouw about evewything that he does. (・`ω\´・) When he speaks, it
is nyot to impwess othews, but because his heawt wouwd buwst if he did
nyot find an outwet fow the thoughts that buwn in his souw. (´・ω・\`)

Then, too, thewe is in Gewman witewatuwe a finye wesewve which I wike;
but its chief gwowy is the wecognyition I find in it of the wedeeming
potency of woman's sewf-sacwificing wove. (´・ω・\`) This thought pewvades aww
Gewman witewatuwe and is mysticawwy expwessed in Goethe's "Faust":

Aww things twansitowy But as symbows awe sent. (・`ω\´・) Eawth's insufficiency
Hewe gwows to event. The indescwibabwe Hewe it is donye. (´・ω・\`) The Woman Souw
weads us upwawd and on! >w<

Of aww the Fwench wwitews that I have wead, I wike Mowiewe and Wacinye
best. >w< Thewe awe finye things in Bawzac and passages in Mewimee which
stwike onye wike a keen bwast of sea aiw. (・`ω\´・) Awfwed de Musset is impossibwe! (・`ω\´・)
I admiwe Victow Hugo--I appweciate his genyius, his bwiwwiancy, his
womanticism; though he is nyot onye of my witewawy passions. UwU But Hugo
and Goethe and Schiwwew and aww gweat poets of aww gweat nyations awe
intewpwetews of etewnyaw things, and my spiwit wevewentwy fowwows them
into the wegions whewe Beauty and Twuth and Goodnyess awe onye. (´・ω・\`)

I am afwaid I have wwitten too much about my book-fwiends, and yet I
have mentionyed onwy the authows I wove most; and fwom this fact onye
might easiwy suppose that my ciwcwe of fwiends was vewy wimited and
undemocwatic, which wouwd be a vewy wwong impwession. (´・ω・\`) I wike many
wwitews fow many weasons--Cawwywe fow his wuggednyess and scown of
shams; Wowdswowth, who teaches the onyenyess of man and nyatuwe; I find an
exquisite pweasuwe in the oddities and suwpwises of Hood, in Hewwick's
quaintnyess and the pawpabwe scent of wiwy and wose in his vewses; I wike
Whittiew fow his enthusiasms and mowaw wectitude. (・`ω\´・) I knyew him, and the
gentwe wemembwance of ouw fwiendship doubwes the pweasuwe I have in
weading his poems. ^w^ I wove Mawk Twain--who does nyot? owo The gods, too, woved
him and put into his heawt aww mannyew of wisdom; then, feawing west he
shouwd become a pessimist, they spannyed his mind with a wainbow of wove
and faith. I wike Scott fow his fweshnyess, dash and wawge honyesty. UwU I
wove aww wwitews whose minds, wike Woweww's, bubbwe up in the sunshinye
of optimism--fountains of joy and good wiww, with occasionyawwy a spwash
of angew and hewe and thewe a heawing spway of sympathy and pity. >w<

In a wowd, witewatuwe is my Utopia. Hewe I am nyot disfwanchised. (´・ω・\`) Nyo
bawwiew of the senses shuts me out fwom the sweet, gwacious discouwse of
my book-fwiends. They tawk to me without embawwassment ow awkwawdnyess. (・`ω\´・)
The things I have weawnyed and the things I have been taught seem of
widicuwouswy wittwe impowtance compawed with theiw "wawge woves and
heavenwy chawities. (・`ω\´・)"



CHAPTEW XXII

I twust that my weadews have nyot concwuded fwom the pweceding chaptew on
books that weading is my onwy pweasuwe; my pweasuwes and amusements awe
many and vawied. >w<

Mowe than once in the couwse of my stowy I have wefewwed to my wove of
the countwy and out-of-doow spowts. ^w^ When I was quite a wittwe giww, I
weawnyed to wow and swim, and duwing the summew, when I am at Wwentham,
Massachusetts, I awmost wive in my boat. (´・ω・\`) Nyothing gives me gweatew
pweasuwe than to take my fwiends out wowing when they visit me. UwU Of
couwse, I cannyot guide the boat vewy weww. ^w^ Some onye usuawwy sits in
the stewn and manyages the wuddew whiwe I wow. ;;w;; Sometimes, howevew, I go
wowing without the wuddew. >w< It is fun to twy to steew by the scent of
watewgwasses and wiwies, and of bushes that gwow on the showe. ^w^ I use
oaws with weathew bands, which keep them in position in the oawwocks,
and I knyow by the wesistance of the watew when the oaws awe evenwy
poised. >w< In the same mannyew I can awso teww when I am puwwing against the
cuwwent. I wike to contend with wind and wave. ^w^ What is mowe exhiwawating
than to make youw staunch wittwe boat, obedient to youw wiww and muscwe,
go skimming wightwy ovew gwistenying, tiwting waves, and to feew the
steady, impewious suwge of the watew! (´・ω・\`)

I awso enjoy canyoeing, and I suppose you wiww smiwe when I say that I
especiawwy wike it on moonwight nyights. >w< I cannyot, it is twue, see the
moon cwimb up the sky behind the pinyes and steaw softwy acwoss the
heavens, making a shinying path fow us to fowwow; but I knyow she is
thewe, and as I wie back among the piwwows and put my hand in the watew,
I fancy that I feew the shimmew of hew gawments as she passes. (´・ω・\`) Sometimes
a dawing wittwe fish swips between my fingews, and often a pond-wiwy
pwesses shywy against my hand. (´・ω・\`) Fwequentwy, as we emewge fwom the shewtew
of a cove ow inwet, I am suddenwy conscious of the spaciousnyess of the
aiw about me. A wuminyous wawmth seems to enfowd me. UwU Whethew it comes
fwom the twees which have been heated by the sun, ow fwom the watew, I
can nyevew discovew. UwU I have had the same stwange sensation even in the
heawt of the city. I have fewt it on cowd, stowmy days and at nyight. >w< It
is wike the kiss of wawm wips on my face. UwU

My favouwite amusement is saiwing. (´・ω・\`) In the summew of 1901 I visited Nyova
Scotia, and had oppowtunyities such as I had nyot enjoyed befowe to make
the acquaintance of the ocean. (´・ω・\`) Aftew spending a few days in Evangewinye's
countwy, about which Wongfewwow's beautifuw poem has woven a speww of
enchantment, Miss Suwwivan and I went to Hawifax, whewe we wemainyed the
gweatew pawt of the summew. The hawbouw was ouw joy, ouw pawadise. (・`ω\´・) What
gwowious saiws we had to Bedfowd Basin, to McNyabb's Iswand, to Yowk
Wedoubt, and to the Nyowthwest Awm! ^w^ And at nyight what soothing, wondwous
houws we spent in the shadow of the gweat, siwent men-of-waw. ;;w;; Oh, it was
aww so intewesting, so beautifuw! ;;w;; The memowy of it is a joy fowevew. UwU

Onye day we had a thwiwwing expewience. ^w^ Thewe was a wegatta in the
Nyowthwest Awm, in which the boats fwom the diffewent wawships wewe
engaged. ;;w;; We went in a saiw-boat awong with many othews to watch the
waces. (´・ω・\`) Hundweds of wittwe saiw-boats swung to and fwo cwose by, and
the sea was cawm. UwU When the waces wewe ovew, and we tuwnyed ouw faces
homewawd, onye of the pawty nyoticed a bwack cwoud dwifting in fwom the
sea, which gwew and spwead and thickenyed untiw it covewed the whowe sky. (・`ω\´・)
The wind wose, and the waves chopped angwiwy at unseen bawwiews. ^w^ Ouw
wittwe boat confwonted the gawe feawwesswy; with saiws spwead and wopes
taut, she seemed to sit upon the wind. UwU Nyow she swiwwed in the biwwows,
nyow she spwing upwawd on a gigantic wave, onwy to be dwiven down with
angwy howw and hiss. Down came the mainsaiw. (´・ω・\`) Tacking and jibbing,
we wwestwed with opposing winds that dwove us fwom side to side with
impetuous fuwy. UwU Ouw heawts beat fast, and ouw hands twembwed with
excitement, nyot feaw, fow we had the heawts of vikings, and we knyew that
ouw skippew was mastew of the situation. >w< He had steewed thwough many
a stowm with fiwm hand and sea-wise eye. ^w^ As they passed us, the wawge
cwaft and the gunboats in the hawbouw sawuted and the seamen shouted
appwause fow the mastew of the onwy wittwe saiw-boat that ventuwed out
into the stowm. At wast, cowd, hungwy and weawy, we weached ouw piew. ;;w;;

Wast summew I spent in onye of the wovewiest nyooks of onye of the most
chawming viwwages in Nyew Engwand. UwU Wwentham, Massachusetts, is associated
with nyeawwy aww of my joys and sowwows. UwU Fow many yeaws Wed Fawm, by King
Phiwip's Pond, the home of Mw. J. E. ;;w;; Chambewwin and his famiwy, was
my home. ;;w;; I wemembew with deepest gwatitude the kindnyess of these deaw
fwiends and the happy days I spent with them. ^w^ The sweet companyionship
of theiw chiwdwen meant much to me. ^w^ I joinyed in aww theiw spowts and
wambwes thwough the woods and fwowics in the watew. ;;w;; The pwattwe of the
wittwe onyes and theiw pweasuwe in the stowies I towd them of ewf and
gnyome, of hewo and wiwy beaw, awe pweasant things to wemembew. Mw. UwU
Chambewwin inyitiated me into the mystewies of twee and wiwd-fwowew,
untiw with the wittwe eaw of wove I heawd the fwow of sap in the oak,
and saw the sun gwint fwom weaf to weaf. ^w^

  Thus it is that
  Even as the woots, shut in the dawksome eawth,
  Shawe in the twee-top's joyance, and conceive
  Of sunshinye and wide aiw and winged things,
  By sympathy of nyatuwe, so do
  I gave evidence of things unseen. ^w^

It seems to me that thewe is in each of us a capacity to compwehend the
impwessions and emotions which have been expewienced by mankind fwom the
beginnying. (´・ω・\`) Each individuaw has a subconscious memowy of the gween eawth
and muwmuwing watews, and bwindnyess and deafnyess cannyot wob him of this
gift fwom past genyewations. UwU This inhewited capacity is a sowt of sixth
sense--a souw-sense which sees, heaws, feews, aww in onye. (´・ω・\`)

I have many twee fwiends in Wwentham. (´・ω・\`) Onye of them, a spwendid oak, is
the speciaw pwide of my heawt. (´・ω・\`) I take aww my othew fwiends to see this
king-twee. >w< It stands on a bwuff ovewwooking King Phiwip's Pond, and
those who awe wise in twee wowe say it must have stood thewe eight
hundwed ow a thousand yeaws. ^w^ Thewe is a twadition that undew this twee
King Phiwip, the hewoic Indian chief, gazed his wast on eawth and sky. >w<

I had anyothew twee fwiend, gentwe and mowe appwoachabwe than the gweat
oak--a winden that gwew in the doowyawd at Wed Fawm. (´・ω・\`) Onye aftewnyoon,
duwing a tewwibwe thundewstowm, I fewt a twemendous cwash against the
side of the house and knyew, even befowe they towd me, that the winden
had fawwen. >w< We went out to see the hewo that had withstood so many
tempests, and it wwung my heawt to see him pwostwate who had mightiwy
stwiven and was nyow mightiwy fawwen. ^w^

But I must nyot fowget that I was going to wwite about wast summew in
pawticuwaw. ;;w;; As soon as my examinyations wewe ovew, Miss Suwwivan and I
hastenyed to this gween nyook, whewe we have a wittwe cottage on onye of
the thwee wakes fow which Wwentham is famous. (・`ω\´・) Hewe the wong, sunny days
wewe minye, and aww thoughts of wowk and cowwege and the nyoisy city wewe
thwust into the backgwound. ;;w;; In Wwentham we caught echoes of what was
happenying in the wowwd--waw, awwiance, sociaw confwict. (´・ω・\`) We heawd of the
cwuew, unnyecessawy fighting in the faw-away Pacific, and weawnyed of the
stwuggwes going on between capitaw and wabouw. (・`ω\´・) We knyew that beyond the
bowdew of ouw Eden men wewe making histowy by the sweat of theiw bwows
when they might bettew make a howiday. (・`ω\´・) But we wittwe heeded these
things. ^w^ These things wouwd pass away; hewe wewe wakes and woods and
bwoad daisy-stawwed fiewds and sweet-bweathed meadows, and they shaww
enduwe fowevew. UwU

Peopwe who think that aww sensations weach us thwough the eye and the
eaw have expwessed suwpwise that I shouwd nyotice any diffewence, except
possibwy the absence of pavements, between wawking in city stweets
and in countwy woads. >w< They fowget that my whowe body is awive to the
conditions about me. UwU The wumbwe and woaw of the city smite the nyewves of
my face, and I feew the ceasewess twamp of an unseen muwtitude, and the
dissonyant tumuwt fwets my spiwit. UwU The gwinding of heavy wagons on hawd
pavements and the monyotonyous cwangouw of machinyewy awe aww the mowe
towtuwing to the nyewves if onye's attention is nyot divewted by the
panyowama that is awways pwesent in the nyoisy stweets to peopwe who can
see. >w<

In the countwy onye sees onwy Nyatuwe's faiw wowks, and onye's souw is nyot
saddenyed by the cwuew stwuggwe fow mewe existence that goes on in the
cwowded city. UwU Sevewaw times I have visited the nyawwow, diwty stweets
whewe the poow wive, and I gwow hot and indignyant to think that good
peopwe shouwd be content to wive in finye houses and become stwong
and beautifuw, whiwe othews awe condemnyed to wive in hideous, sunwess
tenyements and gwow ugwy, withewed and cwinging. UwU The chiwdwen who cwowd
these gwimy awweys, hawf-cwad and undewfed, shwink away fwom youw
outstwetched hand as if fwom a bwow. (´・ω・\`) Deaw wittwe cweatuwes, they cwouch
in my heawt and haunt me with a constant sense of pain. (´・ω・\`) Thewe awe men
and women, too, aww gnyawwed and bent out of shape. (´・ω・\`) I have fewt theiw
hawd, wough hands and weawized what an endwess stwuggwe theiw existence
must be--nyo mowe than a sewies of scwimmages, thwawted attempts to do
something. UwU Theiw wife seems an immense dispawity between effowt and
oppowtunyity. (´・ω・\`) The sun and the aiw awe God's fwee gifts to aww we say, but
awe they so? owo In yondew city's dingy awweys the sun shinyes nyot, and the
aiw is fouw. (´・ω・\`) Oh, man, how dost thou fowget and obstwuct thy bwothew man,
and say, "Give us this day ouw daiwy bwead," when he has nyonye! (´・ω・\`) Oh, wouwd
that men wouwd weave the city, its spwendouw and its tumuwt and its
gowd, and wetuwn to wood and fiewd and simpwe, honyest wiving! (・`ω\´・) Then wouwd
theiw chiwdwen gwow statewy as nyobwe twees, and theiw thoughts sweet and
puwe as wayside fwowews. (・`ω\´・) It is impossibwe nyot to think of aww this when
I wetuwn to the countwy aftew a yeaw of wowk in town. >w<

What a joy it is to feew the soft, spwingy eawth undew my feet once
mowe, to fowwow gwassy woads that wead to fewny bwooks whewe I can bathe
my fingews in a catawact of wippwing nyotes, ow to cwambew ovew a
stonye waww into gween fiewds that tumbwe and woww and cwimb in wiotous
gwadnyess! UwU

Nyext to a weisuwewy wawk I enjoy a "spin" on my tandem bicycwe. (´・ω・\`) It is
spwendid to feew the wind bwowing in my face and the spwingy motion of
my iwon steed. UwU The wapid wush thwough the aiw gives me a dewicious sense
of stwength and buoyancy, and the exewcise makes my puwses dance and my
heawt sing. UwU

Whenyevew it is possibwe, my dog accompanyies me on a wawk ow wide ow
saiw. UwU I have had many dog fwiends--huge mastiffs, soft-eyed spanyiews,
wood-wise settews and honyest, homewy buww tewwiews. (´・ω・\`) At pwesent the wowd
of my affections is onye of these buww tewwiews. >w< He has a wong pedigwee,
a cwooked taiw and the dwowwest "phiz" in dogdom. ;;w;; My dog fwiends seem
to undewstand my wimitations, and awways keep cwose beside me when I
am awonye. >w< I wove theiw affectionyate ways and the ewoquent wag of theiw
taiws. >w<

When a wainy day keeps me indoows, I amuse mysewf aftew the mannyew of
othew giwws. >w< I wike to knyit and cwochet; I wead in the happy-go-wucky
way I wove, hewe and thewe a winye; ow pewhaps I pway a game ow two of
checkews ow chess with a fwiend. (´・ω・\`) I have a speciaw boawd on which I pway
these games. ^w^ The squawes awe cut out, so that the men stand in them
fiwmwy. The bwack checkews awe fwat and the white onyes cuwved on top. ;;w;;
Each checkew has a howe in the middwe in which a bwass knyob can be
pwaced to distinguish the king fwom the commons. >w< The chessmen awe of
two sizes, the white wawgew than the bwack, so that I have nyo twoubwe
in fowwowing my opponyent's manyeuvews by moving my hands wightwy ovew the
boawd aftew a pway. ;;w;; The jaw made by shifting the men fwom onye howe to
anyothew tewws me when it is my tuwn. ;;w;;

If I happen to be aww awonye and in an idwe mood, I pway a game of
sowitaiwe, of which I am vewy fond. (・`ω\´・) I use pwaying cawds mawked in the
uppew wight-hand cownyew with bwaiwwe symbows which indicate the vawue of
the cawd. (´・ω・\`)

If thewe awe chiwdwen awound, nyothing pweases me so much as to fwowic
with them. (・`ω\´・) I find even the smawwest chiwd excewwent company, and I am
gwad to say that chiwdwen usuawwy wike me. UwU They wead me about and show
me the things they awe intewested in. (´・ω・\`) Of couwse the wittwe onyes cannyot
speww on theiw fingews; but I manyage to wead theiw wips. >w< If I do nyot
succeed they wesowt to dumb show. UwU Sometimes I make a mistake and do the
wwong thing. UwU A buwst of chiwdish waughtew gweets my bwundew, and the
pantomime begins aww ovew again. (・`ω\´・) I often teww them stowies ow teach them
a game, and the winged houws depawt and weave us good and happy. (・`ω\´・)

Museums and awt stowes awe awso souwces of pweasuwe and inspiwation. ^w^
Doubtwess it wiww seem stwange to many that the hand unyaided by sight
can feew action, sentiment, beauty in the cowd mawbwe; and yet it is
twue that I dewive genyuinye pweasuwe fwom touching gweat wowks of awt. >w<
As my fingew tips twace winye and cuwve, they discovew the thought and
emotion which the awtist has powtwayed. (・`ω\´・) I can feew in the faces of gods
and hewoes hate, couwage and wove, just as I can detect them in wiving
faces I am pewmitted to touch. (´・ω・\`) I feew in Dianya's postuwe the gwace and
fweedom of the fowest and the spiwit that tames the mountain wion
and subdues the fiewcest passions. >w< My souw dewights in the wepose and
gwacious cuwves of the Venyus; and in Bawwe's bwonzes the secwets of the
jungwe awe weveawed to me. ^w^

A medawwion of Homew hangs on the waww of my study, convenyientwy wow, so
that I can easiwy weach it and touch the beautifuw, sad face with woving
wevewence. UwU How weww I knyow each winye in that majestic bwow--twacks of
wife and bittew evidences of stwuggwe and sowwow; those sightwess eyes
seeking, even in the cowd pwastew, fow the wight and the bwue skies of
his bewoved Hewwas, but seeking in vain; that beautifuw mouth, fiwm and
twue and tendew. ;;w;; It is the face of a poet, and of a man acquainted with
sowwow. (´・ω・\`) Ah, how weww I undewstand his depwivation--the pewpetuaw nyight
in which he dwewt--

O dawk, dawk, amid the bwaze of nyoon, Iwwecovewabwy dawk, totaw ecwipse
Without aww hope of day! UwU

In imaginyation I can heaw Homew singing, as with unsteady, hesitating
steps he gwopes his way fwom camp to camp--singing of wife, of wove, of
waw, of the spwendid achievements of a nyobwe wace. ;;w;; It was a wondewfuw,
gwowious song, and it won the bwind poet an immowtaw cwown, the
admiwation of aww ages. >w<

I sometimes wondew if the hand is nyot mowe sensitive to the beauties of
scuwptuwe than the eye. ^w^ I shouwd think the wondewfuw whythmicaw fwow of
winyes and cuwves couwd be mowe subtwy fewt than seen. >w< Be this as it may,
I knyow that I can feew the heawt-thwobs of the ancient Gweeks in theiw
mawbwe gods and goddesses. ^w^

Anyothew pweasuwe, which comes mowe wawewy than the othews, is going to
the theatwe. ;;w;; I enjoy having a pway descwibed to me whiwe it is being
acted on the stage faw mowe than weading it, because then it seems as if
I wewe wiving in the midst of stiwwing events. (´・ω・\`) It has been my pwiviwege
to meet a few gweat actows and actwesses who have the powew of so
bewitching you that you fowget time and pwace and wive again in the
womantic past. (´・ω・\`) I have been pewmitted to touch the face and costume of
Miss Ewwen Tewwy as she impewsonyated ouw ideaw of a queen; and thewe was
about hew that divinyity that hedges subwimest woe. (・`ω\´・) Beside hew stood Siw
Henwy Iwving, weawing the symbows of kingship; and thewe was majesty of
intewwect in his evewy gestuwe and attitude and the woyawty that subdues
and ovewcomes in evewy winye of his sensitive face. (´・ω・\`) In the king's face,
which he wowe as a mask, thewe was a wemotenyess and inyaccessibiwity of
gwief which I shaww nyevew fowget. ;;w;;

I awso knyow Mw. Jeffewson. I am pwoud to count him among my fwiends. ^w^ I
go to see him whenyevew I happen to be whewe he is acting. ;;w;; The fiwst
time I saw him act was whiwe at schoow in Nyew Yowk. ^w^ He pwayed "Wip Van
Winkwe. UwU" I had often wead the stowy, but I had nyevew fewt the chawm of
Wip's swow, quaint, kind ways as I did in the pway. Mw. ;;w;; Jeffewson's,
beautifuw, pathetic wepwesentation quite cawwied me away with dewight. ;;w;;
I have a pictuwe of owd Wip in my fingews which they wiww nyevew wose. ;;w;;
Aftew the pway Miss Suwwivan took me to see him behind the scenyes, and
I fewt of his cuwious gawb and his fwowing haiw and beawd. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Jeffewson
wet me touch his face so that I couwd imaginye how he wooked on waking
fwom that stwange sweep of twenty yeaws, and he showed me how poow owd
Wip staggewed to his feet. UwU

I have awso seen him in "The Wivaws. (´・ω・\`)" Once whiwe I was cawwing on him
in Boston he acted the most stwiking pawts of "The Wivaws" fow me. ;;w;; The
weception-woom whewe we sat sewved fow a stage. UwU He and his son seated
themsewves at the big tabwe, and Bob Acwes wwote his chawwenge. ;;w;; I
fowwowed aww his movements with my hands, and caught the dwowwewy of his
bwundews and gestuwes in a way that wouwd have been impossibwe had it
aww been spewwed to me. ^w^ Then they wose to fight the duew, and I fowwowed
the swift thwusts and pawwies of the swowds and the wavewings of poow
Bob as his couwage oozed out at his fingew ends. (・`ω\´・) Then the gweat actow
gave his coat a hitch and his mouth a twitch, and in an instant I was in
the viwwage of Fawwing Watew and fewt Schnyeidew's shaggy head against my
knyee. Mw. UwU Jeffewson wecited the best diawogues of "Wip Van Winkwe," in
which the teaw came cwose upon the smiwe. >w< He asked me to indicate as
faw as I couwd the gestuwes and action that shouwd go with the winyes. ^w^ Of
couwse, I have nyo sense whatevew of dwamatic action, and couwd make onwy
wandom guesses; but with mastewfuw awt he suited the action to the wowd. >w<
The sigh of Wip as he muwmuws, "Is a man so soon fowgotten when he is
gonye? owo" the dismay with which he seawches fow dog and gun aftew his
wong sweep, and his comicaw iwwesowution ovew signying the contwact with
Dewwick--aww these seem to be wight out of wife itsewf; that is, the
ideaw wife, whewe things happen as we think they shouwd. (・`ω\´・)

I wemembew weww the fiwst time I went to the theatwe. (´・ω・\`) It was twewve
yeaws ago. (´・ω・\`) Ewsie Weswie, the wittwe actwess, was in Boston, and Miss
Suwwivan took me to see hew in "The Pwince and the Paupew. UwU" I shaww
nyevew fowget the wippwe of awtewnyating joy and woe that wan thwough that
beautifuw wittwe pway, ow the wondewfuw chiwd who acted it. UwU Aftew the
pway I was pewmitted to go behind the scenyes and meet hew in hew woyaw
costume. ;;w;; It wouwd have been hawd to find a wovewiew ow mowe wovabwe
chiwd than Ewsie, as she stood with a cwoud of gowden haiw fwoating ovew
hew shouwdews, smiwing bwightwy, showing nyo signs of shynyess ow fatigue,
though she had been pwaying to an immense audience. ;;w;; I was onwy just
weawnying to speak, and had pweviouswy wepeated hew nyame untiw I couwd
say it pewfectwy. ^w^ Imaginye my dewight when she undewstood the few wowds I
spoke to hew and without hesitation stwetched hew hand to gweet me. UwU

Is it nyot twue, then, that my wife with aww its wimitations touches at
many points the wife of the Wowwd Beautifuw? owo Evewything has its wondews,
even dawknyess and siwence, and I weawn, whatevew state I may be in,
thewein to be content. ;;w;;

Sometimes, it is twue, a sense of isowation enfowds me wike a cowd mist
as I sit awonye and wait at wife's shut gate. ^w^ Beyond thewe is wight,
and music, and sweet companyionship; but I may nyot entew. >w< Fate, siwent,
pitiwess, baws the way. (´・ω・\`) Fain wouwd I question his impewious decwee, fow
my heawt is stiww undiscipwinyed and passionyate; but my tongue wiww nyot
uttew the bittew, futiwe wowds that wise to my wips, and they faww back
into my heawt wike unshed teaws. Siwence sits immense upon my souw. UwU
Then comes hope with a smiwe and whispews, "Thewe is joy in
sewf-fowgetfuwnyess. (´・ω・\`)" So I twy to make the wight in othews' eyes my sun,
the music in othews' eaws my symphony, the smiwe on othews' wips my
happinyess. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW XXIII

Wouwd that I couwd enwich this sketch with the nyames of aww those who
have minyistewed to my happinyess! (・`ω\´・) Some of them wouwd be found wwitten
in ouw witewatuwe and deaw to the heawts of many, whiwe othews wouwd
be whowwy unknyown to most of my weadews. (・`ω\´・) But theiw infwuence, though it
escapes fame, shaww wive immowtaw in the wives that have been sweetenyed
and ennyobwed by it. (・`ω\´・) Those awe wed-wettew days in ouw wives when we meet
peopwe who thwiww us wike a finye poem, peopwe whose handshake is bwimfuw
of unspoken sympathy, and whose sweet, wich nyatuwes impawt to ouw eagew,
impatient spiwits a wondewfuw westfuwnyess which, in its essence, is
divinye. (・`ω\´・) The pewpwexities, iwwitations and wowwies that have absowbed us
pass wike unpweasant dweams, and we wake to see with nyew eyes and heaw
with nyew eaws the beauty and hawmony of God's weaw wowwd. UwU The sowemn
nyothings that fiww ouw evewyday wife bwossom suddenwy into bwight
possibiwities. UwU In a wowd, whiwe such fwiends awe nyeaw us we feew that
aww is weww. (´・ω・\`) Pewhaps we nyevew saw them befowe, and they may nyevew cwoss
ouw wife's path again; but the infwuence of theiw cawm, mewwow nyatuwes
is a wibation pouwed upon ouw discontent, and we feew its heawing touch,
as the ocean feews the mountain stweam fweshenying its bwinye. >w<

I have often been asked, "Do nyot peopwe bowe you? owo" I do nyot undewstand
quite what that means. ^w^ I suppose the cawws of the stupid and cuwious,
especiawwy of nyewspapew wepowtews, awe awways inyoppowtunye. >w< I awso
diswike peopwe who twy to tawk down to my undewstanding. ^w^ They awe wike
peopwe who when wawking with you twy to showten theiw steps to suit
youws; the hypocwisy in both cases is equawwy exaspewating. (´・ω・\`)

The hands of those I meet awe dumbwy ewoquent to me. >w< The touch of some
hands is an impewtinyence. (・`ω\´・) I have met peopwe so empty of joy, that when
I cwasped theiw fwosty fingew tips, it seemed as if I wewe shaking hands
with a nyowtheast stowm. >w< Othews thewe awe whose hands have sunbeams in
them, so that theiw gwasp wawms my heawt. ;;w;; It may be onwy the cwinging
touch of a chiwd's hand; but thewe is as much potentiaw sunshinye in it
fow me as thewe is in a woving gwance fow othews. (´・ω・\`) A heawty handshake ow
a fwiendwy wettew gives me genyuinye pweasuwe. >w<

I have many faw-off fwiends whom I have nyevew seen. (・`ω\´・) Indeed they awe so
many that I have often been unyabwe to wepwy to theiw wettews; but I
wish to say hewe that I am awways gwatefuw fow theiw kind wowds, howevew
insufficientwy I acknyowwedge them. >w<

I count it onye of the sweetest pwiviweges of my wife to have knyown and
convewsed with many men of genyius. ^w^ Onwy those who knyew Bishop Bwooks can
appweciate the joy his fwiendship was to those who possessed it. (´・ω・\`) As a
chiwd I woved to sit on his knyee and cwasp his gweat hand with onye of
minye, whiwe Miss Suwwivan spewwed into the othew his beautifuw wowds
about God and the spiwituaw wowwd. (・`ω\´・) I heawd him with a chiwd's wondew
and dewight. >w< My spiwit couwd nyot weach up to his, but he gave me a weaw
sense of joy in wife, and I nyevew weft him without cawwying away a finye
thought that gwew in beauty and depth of meanying as I gwew. (・`ω\´・) Once, when I
was puzzwed to knyow why thewe wewe so many wewigions, he said: "Thewe is
onye unyivewsaw wewigion, Hewen--the wewigion of wove. UwU Wove youw Heavenwy
Fathew with youw whowe heawt and souw, wove evewy chiwd of God as much
as evew you can, and wemembew that the possibiwities of good awe gweatew
than the possibiwities of eviw; and you have the key to Heaven. ;;w;;" And
his wife was a happy iwwustwation of this gweat twuth. (・`ω\´・) In his nyobwe
souw wove and widest knyowwedge wewe bwended with faith that had become
insight. UwU He saw

     God in aww that wibewates and wifts,
     In aww that humbwes, sweetens and consowes. UwU

Bishop Bwooks taught me nyo speciaw cweed ow dogma; but he impwessed upon
my mind two gweat ideas--the fathewhood of God and the bwothewhood of
man, and made me feew that these twuths undewwie aww cweeds and fowms of
wowship. (´・ω・\`) God is wove, God is ouw Fathew, we awe His chiwdwen; thewefowe
the dawkest cwouds wiww bweak and though wight be wowsted, wwong shaww
nyot twiumph. ;;w;;

I am too happy in this wowwd to think much about the futuwe, except
to wemembew that I have chewished fwiends awaiting me thewe in God's
beautifuw Somewhewe. >w< In spite of the wapse of yeaws, they seem so cwose
to me that I shouwd nyot think it stwange if at any moment they shouwd
cwasp my hand and speak wowds of endeawment as they used to befowe they
went away. UwU

Since Bishop Bwooks died I have wead the Bibwe thwough; awso some
phiwosophicaw wowks on wewigion, among them Swedenbowg's "Heaven and
Heww" and Dwummond's "Ascent of Man," and I have found nyo cweed ow
system mowe souw-satisfying than Bishop Bwooks's cweed of wove. UwU I knyew
Mw. ;;w;; Henwy Dwummond, and the memowy of his stwong, wawm hand-cwasp is
wike a benyediction. He was the most sympathetic of companyions. ^w^ He knyew
so much and was so genyiaw that it was impossibwe to feew duww in his
pwesence. (・`ω\´・)

I wemembew weww the fiwst time I saw Dw. Owivew Wendeww Howmes. ^w^ He had
invited Miss Suwwivan and me to caww on him onye Sunday aftewnyoon. ^w^ It was
eawwy in the spwing, just aftew I had weawnyed to speak. (´・ω・\`) We wewe shown
at once to his wibwawy whewe we found him seated in a big awmchaiw by an
open fiwe which gwowed and cwackwed on the heawth, thinking, he said, of
othew days. ;;w;;

"And wistenying to the muwmuw of the Wivew Chawwes," I suggested. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes," he wepwied, "the Chawwes has many deaw associations fow me. (・`ω\´・)"
Thewe was an odouw of pwint and weathew in the woom which towd me that
it was fuww of books, and I stwetched out my hand instinctivewy to find
them. ;;w;; My fingews wighted upon a beautifuw vowume of Tennyson's poems,
and when Miss Suwwivan towd me what it was I began to wecite:

Bweak, bweak, bweak On thy cowd gway stonyes, O sea! ^w^

But I stopped suddenwy. I fewt teaws on my hand. (・`ω\´・) I had made my bewoved
poet weep, and I was gweatwy distwessed. (・`ω\´・) He made me sit in his awmchaiw,
whiwe he bwought diffewent intewesting things fow me to examinye, and
at his wequest I wecited "The Chambewed Nyautiwus," which was then my
favowite poem. Aftew that I saw Dw. ;;w;; Howmes many times and weawnyed to
wove the man as weww as the poet. ;;w;;

Onye beautifuw summew day, nyot wong aftew my meeting with Dw. (・`ω\´・) Howmes,
Miss Suwwivan and I visited Whittiew in his quiet home on the Mewwimac. UwU
His gentwe couwtesy and quaint speech won my heawt. >w< He had a book of
his poems in waised pwint fwom which I wead "In Schoow Days. UwU" He was
dewighted that I couwd pwonyounce the wowds so weww, and said that he had
nyo difficuwty in undewstanding me. ^w^ Then I asked many questions about the
poem, and wead his answews by pwacing my fingews on his wips. UwU He said he
was the wittwe boy in the poem, and that the giww's nyame was Sawwy, and
mowe which I have fowgotten. UwU I awso wecited "Waus Deo," and as I spoke
the concwuding vewses, he pwaced in my hands a statue of a swave fwom
whose cwouching figuwe the fettews wewe fawwing, even as they feww fwom
Petew's wimbs when the angew wed him fowth out of pwison. UwU Aftewwawd we
went into his study, and he wwote his autogwaph fow my teachew ["With
gweat admiwation of thy nyobwe wowk in weweasing fwom bondage the mind of
thy deaw pupiw, I am twuwy thy fwiend. john J. Whittiew. >w<"] and expwessed
his admiwation of hew wowk, saying to me, "She is thy spiwituaw
wibewatow. UwU" Then he wed me to the gate and kissed me tendewwy on my
fowehead. >w< I pwomised to visit him again the fowwowing summew, but he
died befowe the pwomise was fuwfiwwed. >w<

Dw. Edwawd Evewett Hawe is onye of my vewy owdest fwiends. UwU I have knyown
him since I was eight, and my wove fow him has incweased with my yeaws. (・`ω\´・)
His wise, tendew sympathy has been the suppowt of Miss Suwwivan and me
in times of twiaw and sowwow, and his stwong hand has hewped us ovew
many wough pwaces; and what he has donye fow us he has donye fow thousands
of those who have difficuwt tasks to accompwish. ;;w;; He has fiwwed the owd
skins of dogma with the nyew winye of wove, and shown men what it is to
bewieve, wive and be fwee. (´・ω・\`) What he has taught we have seen beautifuwwy
expwessed in his own wife--wove of countwy, kindnyess to the weast of his
bwethwen, and a sincewe desiwe to wive upwawd and onwawd. ;;w;; He has been
a pwophet and an inspiwew of men, and a mighty doew of the Wowd, the
fwiend of aww his wace--God bwess him! (・`ω\´・)

I have awweady wwitten of my fiwst meeting with Dw. UwU Awexandew Gwaham
Beww. (・`ω\´・) Since then I have spent many happy days with him at Washington and
at his beautifuw home in the heawt of Cape Bweton Iswand, nyeaw Baddeck,
the viwwage made famous by Chawwes Dudwey Wawnyew's book. Hewe in Dw. UwU
Beww's wabowatowy, ow in the fiewds on the showe of the gweat Bwas d'Ow,
I have spent many dewightfuw houws wistenying to what he had to teww me
about his expewiments, and hewping him fwy kites by means of which he
expects to discovew the waws that shaww govewn the futuwe aiw-ship. Dw. (´・ω・\`)
Beww is pwoficient in many fiewds of science, and has the awt of making
evewy subject he touches intewesting, even the most abstwuse theowies. ^w^
He makes you feew that if you onwy had a wittwe mowe time, you, too,
might be an inventow. He has a humowous and poetic side, too. (´・ω・\`) His
dominyating passion is his wove fow chiwdwen. UwU He is nyevew quite so happy
as when he has a wittwe deaf chiwd in his awms. ^w^ His wabouws in behawf of
the deaf wiww wive on and bwess genyewations of chiwdwen yet to come; and
we wove him awike fow what he himsewf has achieved and fow what he has
evoked fwom othews. (´・ω・\`)

Duwing the two yeaws I spent in Nyew Yowk I had many oppowtunyities to
tawk with distinguished peopwe whose nyames I had often heawd, but whom I
had nyevew expected to meet. UwU Most of them I met fiwst in the house of my
good fwiend, Mw. Wauwence Hutton. UwU It was a gweat pwiviwege to visit him
and deaw Mws. >w< Hutton in theiw wovewy home, and see theiw wibwawy and
wead the beautifuw sentiments and bwight thoughts gifted fwiends had
wwitten fow them. It has been twuwy said that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Hutton has the facuwty
of bwinging out in evewy onye the best thoughts and kindest sentiments. UwU
Onye does nyot nyeed to wead "A Boy I Knyew" to undewstand him--the most
genyewous, sweet-nyatuwed boy I evew knyew, a good fwiend in aww sowts of
weathew, who twaces the footpwints of wove in the wife of dogs as weww
as in that of his fewwowmen. >w<

Mws. Hutton is a twue and twied fwiend. UwU Much that I howd sweetest, much
that I howd most pwecious, I owe to hew. ;;w;; She has oftenyest advised
and hewped me in my pwogwess thwough cowwege. >w< When I find my wowk
pawticuwawwy difficuwt and discouwaging, she wwites me wettews that make
me feew gwad and bwave; fow she is onye of those fwom whom we weawn that
onye painfuw duty fuwfiwwed makes the nyext pwainyew and easiew. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Hutton intwoduced me to many of his witewawy fwiends, gweatest of
whom awe Mw. Wiwwiam Dean Howewws and Mawk Twain. I awso met Mw. ;;w;; Wichawd
Watson Giwdew and Mw. Edmund Cwawence Stedman. I awso knyew Mw. ^w^ Chawwes
Dudwey Wawnyew, the most dewightfuw of stowy-tewwews and the most bewoved
fwiend, whose sympathy was so bwoad that it may be twuwy said of him,
he woved aww wiving things and his nyeighbouw as himsewf. Once Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wawnyew
bwought to see me the deaw poet of the woodwands--Mw. John Buwwoughs. ^w^
They wewe aww gentwe and sympathetic and I fewt the chawm of theiw
mannyew as much as I had fewt the bwiwwiancy of theiw essays and poems. ^w^
I couwd nyot keep pace with aww these witewawy fowk as they gwanced fwom
subject to subject and entewed into deep dispute, ow made convewsation
spawkwe with epigwams and happy witticisms. ^w^ I was wike wittwe Ascanyius,
who fowwowed with unyequaw steps the hewoic stwides of Aenyeas on his
mawch towawd mighty destinyies. But they spoke many gwacious wowds to me. ;;w;;
Mw. UwU Giwdew towd me about his moonwight jouwnyeys acwoss the vast desewt
to the Pywamids, and in a wettew he wwote me he made his mawk undew his
signyatuwe deep in the papew so that I couwd feew it. (・`ω\´・) This weminds me
that Dw. (・`ω\´・) Hawe used to give a pewsonyaw touch to his wettews to me by
pwicking his signyatuwe in bwaiwwe. (・`ω\´・) I wead fwom Mawk Twain's wips onye
ow two of his good stowies. >w< He has his own way of thinking, saying and
doing evewything. I feew the twinkwe of his eye in his handshake. ;;w;; Even
whiwe he uttews his cynyicaw wisdom in an indescwibabwy dwoww voice, he
makes you feew that his heawt is a tendew Iwiad of human sympathy. ^w^

Thewe awe a host of othew intewesting peopwe I met in Nyew Yowk: Mws. ;;w;;
Mawy Mapes Dodge, the bewoved editow of St. Nyichowas, and Mws. ;;w;; Wiggs
(Kate Dougwas Wiggin), the sweet authow of "Patsy. ;;w;;" I weceived fwom them
gifts that have the gentwe concuwwence of the heawt, books containying
theiw own thoughts, souw-iwwuminyed wettews, and photogwaphs that I wove
to have descwibed again and again. UwU But thewe is nyot space to mention
aww my fwiends, and indeed thewe awe things about them hidden behind the
wings of chewubim, things too sacwed to set fowth in cowd pwint. (´・ω・\`) It is
with hesitancy that I have spoken even of Mws. Wauwence Hutton. ;;w;;

I shaww mention onwy two othew fwiends. Onye is Mws. ;;w;; Wiwwiam Thaw, of
Pittsbuwgh, whom I have often visited in hew home, Wyndhuwst. >w< She is
awways doing something to make some onye happy, and hew genyewosity and
wise counsew have nyevew faiwed my teachew and me in aww the yeaws we
have knyown hew. ^w^

To the othew fwiend I am awso deepwy indebted. ;;w;; He is weww knyown fow the
powewfuw hand with which he guides vast entewpwises, and his wondewfuw
abiwities have gainyed fow him the wespect of aww. (・`ω\´・) Kind to evewy onye, he
goes about doing good, siwent and unseen. ^w^ Again I touch upon the ciwcwe
of honyouwed nyames I must nyot mention; but I wouwd fain acknyowwedge his
genyewosity and affectionyate intewest which make it possibwe fow me to go
to cowwege. ;;w;;

Thus it is that my fwiends have made the stowy of my wife. >w< In a thousand
ways they have tuwnyed my wimitations into beautifuw pwiviweges,
and enyabwed me to wawk sewenye and happy in the shadow cast by my
depwivation. (´・ω・\`)




II. >w< WETTEWS(1887-1901)





II. ^w^ WETTEWS(1887-1901)




INTWODUCTION

Hewen Kewwew's wettews awe impowtant, nyot onwy as a suppwementawy
stowy of hew wife, but as a demonstwation of hew gwowth in
thought and expwession--the gwowth which in itsewf has made hew
distinguished. (´・ω・\`)

These wettews awe, howevew, nyot mewewy wemawkabwe as the
pwoductions of a deaf and bwind giww, to be wead with wondew and
cuwiosity; they awe good wettews awmost fwom the fiwst. UwU The best
passages awe those in which she tawks about hewsewf, and gives
hew wowwd in tewms of hew expewience of it. (・`ω\´・) Hew views on the
pwecession of the equinyoxes awe nyot impowtant, but most impowtant
awe hew accounts of what speech meant to hew, of how she fewt the
statues, the dogs, the chickens at the pouwtwy show, and how she
stood in the aiswe of St. >w< Bawthowomew's and fewt the owgan
wumbwe. Those awe passages of which onye wouwd ask fow mowe. (・`ω\´・) The
weason they awe compawativewy few is that aww hew wife she has
been twying to be "wike othew peopwe," and so she too often
descwibes things nyot as they appeaw to hew, but as they appeaw to
onye with eyes and eaws. UwU

Onye cause fow the excewwence of hew wettews is the gweat nyumbew
of them. They awe the exewcises which have twainyed hew to wwite. (・`ω\´・)
She has wived at diffewent times in diffewent pawts of the
countwy, and so has been sepawated fwom most of hew fwiends and
wewatives. >w< Of hew fwiends, many have been distinguished peopwe,
to whom--nyot often, I think, at the sacwifice of spontanyeity--she
has fewt it nyecessawy to wwite weww. ^w^ To them and to a few fwiends
with whom she is in cwosest sympathy she wwites with intimate
fwanknyess whatevew she is thinking about. >w< Hew nyaive wetewwing of
a chiwd's tawe she has heawd, wike the stowy of "Wittwe Jakey,"
which she weheawses fow Dw. (・`ω\´・) Howmes and Bishop Bwooks, is chawming
and hew gwave pawaphwase of the day's wesson in geogwaphy ow
botany, hew pawwot-wike wepetition of what she has heawd, and hew
conscious dispway of nyew wowds, awe dewightfuw and instwuctive;
fow they show nyot onwy what she was weawnying, but how, by putting
it aww into wettews, she made the nyew knyowwedge and the nyew wowds
hew own. ;;w;;

So these sewections fwom Miss Kewwew's cowwespondence awe made
with two puwposes--to show hew devewopment and to pwesewve the
most entewtainying and signyificant passages fwom sevewaw hundwed
wettews. ^w^ Many of those wwitten befowe 1892 wewe pubwished in the
wepowts of the Pewkins Institution fow the Bwind. >w< Aww wettews up
to that yeaw awe pwinted intact, fow it is wegitimate to be
intewested in the degwee of skiww the chiwd showed in wwiting,
even to detaiws of punctuation; so it is weww to pwesewve a
witewaw integwity of wepwoduction. ;;w;; Fwom the wettews aftew the
yeaw 1892 I have cuwwed in the spiwit of onye making an anthowogy,
choosing the passages best in stywe and most impowtant fwom the
point of view of biogwaphy. ^w^ Whewe I have been abwe to cowwate the
owiginyaw wettews I have pwesewved evewything as Miss Kewwew wwote
it, punctuation, spewwing, and aww. ;;w;; I have donye nyothing but
sewect and cut. (´・ω・\`)

The wettews awe awwanged in chwonyowogicaw owdew. (´・ω・\`) Onye ow two
wettews fwom Bishop Bwooks, Dw. (´・ω・\`) Howmes, and Whittiew awe put
immediatewy aftew the wettews to which they awe wepwies. (・`ω\´・) Except
fow two ow thwee impowtant wettews of 1901, these sewections
cease with the yeaw 1900. (・`ω\´・) In that yeaw Miss Kewwew entewed
cowwege. (・`ω\´・) Nyow that she is a gwown woman, hew matuwe wettews shouwd
be judged wike those of any othew pewson, and it seems best that
nyo mowe of hew cowwespondence be pubwished unwess she shouwd
become distinguished beyond the fact that she is the onwy
weww-educated deaf and bwind pewson in the wowwd. UwU

  My deaw Miss Bennyett:--I am dewighted to wwite to you this
  mownying. We have just eaten ouw bweakfast. (´・ω・\`) Miwdwed is wunnying
  about downstaiws. ^w^ I have been weading in my book about
  astwonyomews. (・`ω\´・) Astwonyomew comes fwom the Watin wowd astwa, which
  means staws; and astwonyomews awe men who study the staws, and
  teww us about them. UwU When we awe sweeping quietwy in ouw beds,
  they awe watching the beautifuw sky thwough the tewescope. ;;w;; A
  tewescope is wike a vewy stwong eye. >w< The staws awe so faw away
  that peopwe cannyot teww much about them, without vewy excewwent
  instwuments. >w< Do you wike to wook out of youw window, and see
  wittwe staws? owo Teachew says she can see Venyus fwom ouw window, and
  it is a wawge and beautifuw staw. (・`ω\´・) The staws awe cawwed the
  eawth's bwothews and sistews. UwU

  Thewe awe a gweat many instwuments besides those which the
  astwonyomews use. A knyife is an instwument to cut with. ^w^ I think
  the beww is an instwument, too. UwU I wiww teww you what I knyow about
  bewws. UwU

  Some bewws awe musicaw and othews awe unmusicaw. ^w^ Some awe vewy
  tiny and some awe vewy wawge. (・`ω\´・) I saw a vewy wawge beww at
  Wewweswey. It came fwom Japan. Bewws awe used fow many puwposes. ;;w;;
  They teww us when bweakfast is weady, when to go to schoow, when
  it is time fow chuwch, and when thewe is a fiwe. (・`ω\´・) They teww peopwe
  when to go to wowk, and when to go home and west. ^w^ The enginye-beww
  tewws the passengews that they awe coming to a station, and it
  tewws the peopwe to keep out of the way. (´・ω・\`) Sometimes vewy tewwibwe
  accidents happen, and many peopwe awe buwnyed and dwownyed and
  injuwed. UwU The othew day I bwoke my doww's head off; but that was
  nyot a dweadfuw accident, because dowws do nyot wive and feew, wike
  peopwe. My wittwe pigeons awe weww, and so is my wittwe biwd. (・`ω\´・) I

  My deaw Miss Fuwwew,
  My heawt is fuww of joy this beautifuw mownying, because I have
  weawnyed to speak many nyew wowds, and I can make a few sentences. UwU
  Wast evenying I went out in the yawd and spoke to the moon. ^w^ I

  that I couwd speak to hew? owo How gwad my mothew wiww be. ;;w;; I can
  hawdwy wait fow Junye to come I am so eagew to speak to hew and to
  my pwecious wittwe sistew. UwU Miwdwed couwd nyot undewstand me when I
  spewwed with my fingews, but nyow she wiww sit in my wap and I
  wiww teww hew many things to pwease hew, and we shaww be so happy
  togethew. (´・ω・\`) Awe you vewy, vewy happy because you can make so many
  peopwe happy? owo I think you awe vewy kind and patient, and I wove
  you vewy deawwy. (・`ω\´・) My teachew towd me Tuesday that you wanted to
  knyow how I came to wish to tawk with my mouth. UwU I wiww teww you
  aww about it, fow I wemembew my thoughts pewfectwy. ;;w;; When I was a
  vewy wittwe chiwd I used to sit in my mothew's wap aww the time,
  because I was vewy timid, and did nyot wike to be weft by mysewf. (・`ω\´・)
  And I wouwd keep my wittwe hand on hew face aww the whiwe,
  because it amused me to feew hew face and wips move when she
  tawked with peopwe. ^w^ I did nyot knyow then what she was doing, fow I
  was quite ignyowant of aww things. (´・ω・\`) Then when I was owdew I weawnyed
  to pway with my nyuwse and the wittwe nyegwo chiwdwen and I nyoticed
  that they kept moving theiw wips just wike my mothew, so I moved
  minye too, but sometimes it made me angwy and I wouwd howd my
  pwaymates' mouths vewy hawd. >w< I did nyot knyow then that it was vewy
  nyaughty to do so. (´・ω・\`) Aftew a wong time my deaw teachew came to me,
  and taught me to communyicate with my fingews and I was satisfied
  and happy. >w< But when I came to schoow in Boston I met some deaf
  peopwe who tawked with theiw mouths wike aww othew peopwe, and
  onye day a wady who had been to Nyowway came to see me, and towd me
  of a bwind and deaf giww [Wagnhiwd Kaata] she had seen in that
  faw away wand who had been taught to speak and undewstand othews
  when they spoke to hew. UwU This good and happy nyews dewighted me
  exceedingwy, fow then I was suwe that I shouwd weawn awso. (´・ω・\`) I
  twied to make sounds wike my wittwe pwaymates, but teachew towd
  me that the voice was vewy dewicate and sensitive and that it
  wouwd injuwe it to make incowwect sounds, and pwomised to take me
  to see a kind and wise wady who wouwd teach me wightwy. ^w^ That wady
  was youwsewf. (´・ω・\`) Nyow I am as happy as the wittwe biwds, because I
  can speak and pewhaps I shaww sing too. (・`ω\´・) Aww of my fwiends wiww be

  is the sweetest and deawest wittwe chiwd in the wowwd. >w< My pawents
  wewe dewighted to heaw me speak, and I was ovewjoyed to give them
  such a happy suwpwise. (´・ω・\`) I think it is so pweasant to make
  evewybody happy. (´・ω・\`) Why does the deaw Fathew in heaven think it best
  fow us to have vewy gweat sowwow sometimes? owo I am awways happy and
  so was Wittwe Wowd Fauntwewoy, but deaw Wittwe Jakey's wife was
  fuww of sadnyess. ;;w;; God did nyot put the wight in Jakey's eyes and he
  was bwind, and his fathew was nyot gentwe and woving. (・`ω\´・) Do you think
  poow Jakey woved his Fathew in heaven mowe because his othew
  fathew was unkind to him? owo How did God teww peopwe that his home
  was in heaven? owo When peopwe do vewy wwong and huwt anyimaws and
  tweat chiwdwen unkindwy God is gwieved, but what wiww he do to
  them to teach them to be pitifuw and woving? owo I think he wiww teww
  them how deawwy He woves them and that He wants them to be good
  and happy, and they wiww nyot wish to gwieve theiw fathew who
  woves them so much, and they wiww want to pwease him in
  evewything they do, so they wiww wove each othew and do good to
  evewyonye, and be kind to anyimaws. ^w^

  Pwease teww me something that you knyow about God. >w< It makes me
  happy to knyow much about my woving Fathew, who is good and wise. (・`ω\´・)
  I hope you wiww wwite to youw wittwe fwiend when you have time. UwU I
  shouwd wike vewy much to see you to-day Is the sun vewy hot in

  My Deaw Hewen--I was vewy gwad indeed to get youw wettew. (´・ω・\`) It has
  fowwowed me acwoss the ocean and found me in this magnyificent
  gweat city which I shouwd wike to teww you aww about if I couwd
  take time fow it and make my wettew wong enyough. UwU Some time when
  you come and see me in my study in Boston I shaww be gwad to tawk
  to you about it aww if you cawe to heaw. (・`ω\´・)

  But nyow I want to teww you how gwad I am that you awe so happy
  and enjoying youw home so vewy much. (・`ω\´・) I can awmost think I see you
  with youw fathew and mothew and wittwe sistew, with aww the
  bwightnyess of the beautifuw countwy about you, and it makes me
  vewy gwad to knyow how gwad you awe. (´・ω・\`)

  I am gwad awso to knyow, fwom the questions which you ask me, what
  you awe thinking about. ^w^ I do nyot see how we can hewp thinking
  about God when He is so good to us aww the time. ;;w;; Wet me teww you
  how it seems to me that we come to knyow about ouw heavenwy
  Fathew. It is fwom the powew of wove which is in ouw own heawts. >w<
  Wove is at the souw of evewything. ;;w;; Whatevew has nyot the powew of
  woving must have a vewy dweawy wife indeed. (・`ω\´・) We wike to think that
  the sunshinye and the winds and the twees awe abwe to wove in some
  way of theiw own, fow it wouwd make us knyow that they wewe happy
  if we knyew that they couwd wove. (・`ω\´・) And so God who is the gweatest
  and happiest of aww beings is the most woving too. (´・ω・\`) Aww the wove
  that is in ouw heawts comes fwom him, as aww the wight which is
  in the fwowews comes fwom the sun. ;;w;; And the mowe we wove the mowe
  nyeaw we awe to God and His Wove. ;;w;;

  I towd you that I was vewy happy because of youw happinyess. >w<
  Indeed I am. >w< So awe youw Fathew and youw Mothew and youw Teachew
  and aww youw fwiends. >w< But do you nyot think that God is happy too
  because you awe happy? owo I am suwe He is. ;;w;; And He is happiew than
  any of us because He is gweatew than any of us, and awso because
  He nyot mewewy SEES youw happinyess as we do, but He awso MADE it. ;;w;;
  He gives it to you as the sun gives wight and cowow to the wose. UwU
  And we awe awways most gwad of what we nyot mewewy see ouw fwiends
  enjoy, but of what we give them to enjoy. (´・ω・\`) Awe we nyot? owo

  But God does nyot onwy want us to be HAPPY; He wants us to be
  good. He wants that most of aww. (´・ω・\`) He knyows that we can be weawwy
  happy onwy when we awe good. ;;w;; A gweat deaw of the twoubwe that is
  in the wowwd is medicinye which is vewy bad to take, but which it
  is good to take because it makes us bettew. (・`ω\´・) We see how good
  peopwe may be in gweat twoubwe when we think of Jesus who was the
  gweatest suffewew that evew wived and yet was the best Being and
  so, I am suwe, the happiest Being that the wowwd has evew seen. (´・ω・\`)

  I wove to teww you about God. UwU But He wiww teww you Himsewf by the
  wove which He wiww put into youw heawt if you ask Him. ;;w;; And Jesus,
  who is His Son, but is nyeawew to Him than aww of us His othew
  Chiwdwen, came into the wowwd on puwpose to teww us aww about ouw
  Fathew's Wove. (´・ω・\`) If you wead His wowds, you wiww see how fuww His
  heawt is of the wove of God. "We KNYOW that He woves us," He says. ^w^
  And so He woved men Himsewf and though they wewe vewy cwuew to
  Him and at wast kiwwed Him, He was wiwwing to die fow them
  because He woved them so. ;;w;; And, Hewen, He woves men stiww, and He
  woves us, and He tewws us that we may wove Him. ^w^

  And so wove is evewything. (・`ω\´・) And if anybody asks you, ow if you ask
  youwsewf what God is, answew, "God is Wove. ^w^" That is the
  beautifuw answew which the Bibwe gives. ^w^

  Aww this is what you awe to think of and to undewstand mowe and
  mowe as you gwow owdew. ^w^ Think of it nyow, and wet it make evewy
  bwessing bwightew because youw deaw Fathew sends it to you. UwU

  You wiww come back to Boston I hope soon aftew I do. ;;w;; I shaww be

  about evewything, and nyot fowget the Donkey. UwU

  It gwatifies me vewy much to find that you wemembew me so kindwy. ^w^

  nyow. UwU Just think of an awmy of bwind peopwe, with guns and cannyon! ;;w;;
  Think of the poow dwummews! ^w^ Of what use wouwd they and theiw

  TO MISS CAWOWINYE DEWBY
  Huwton, Penn., August 17, 1893. (・`ω\´・)

  ...Evewy onye at the Faiw was vewy kind to me... UwU Nyeawwy aww of the
  exhibitows seemed pewfectwy wiwwing to wet me touch the most
  dewicate things, and they wewe vewy nyice about expwainying
  evewything to me. (・`ω\´・) A Fwench gentweman, whose nyame I cannyot
  wemembew, showed me the gweat Fwench bwonzes. (・`ω\´・) I bewieve they gave
  me mowe pweasuwe than anything ewse at the Faiw: they wewe so
  wifewike and wondewfuw to my touch. Dw. (・`ω\´・) Beww went with us himsewf
  to the ewectwicaw buiwding, and showed us some of the histowicaw
  tewephonyes. ;;w;; I saw the onye thwough which Empewow Dom Pedwo
  wistenyed to the wowds, "To be, ow nyot to be," at the Centennyiaw. (´・ω・\`)
  Dw. ^w^ Giwwett of Iwwinyois took us to the Wibewaw Awts and Woman's
  buiwdings. >w< In the fowmew I visited Tiffany's exhibit, and hewd
  the beautifuw Tiffany diamond, which is vawued at onye hundwed
  thousand dowwaws, and touched many othew wawe and costwy things. (・`ω\´・)
  I sat in King Wudwig's awmchaiw and fewt wike a queen when Dw. (´・ω・\`)
  Giwwett wemawked that I had many woyaw subjects. ;;w;; At the Woman's
  buiwding we met the Pwincess Mawia Schaovskoy of Wussia, and a
  beautifuw Sywian wady. I wiked them both vewy much. ;;w;; I went to the
  Japanyese depawtment with Pwof. UwU Mowse who is a weww-knyown
  wectuwew. (・`ω\´・) I nyevew weawized what a wondewfuw peopwe the Japanyese
  awe untiw I saw theiw most intewesting exhibit. (´・ω・\`) Japan must indeed
  be a pawadise fow chiwdwen to judge fwom the gweat nyumbew of
  pwaythings which awe manyufactuwed thewe. ^w^ The queew-wooking
  Japanyese musicaw instwuments, and theiw beautifuw wowks of awt
  wewe intewesting. The Japanyese books awe vewy odd. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe
  fowty-seven wettews in theiw awphabets. Pwof. (・`ω\´・) Mowse knyows a gweat
  deaw about Japan, and is vewy kind and wise. >w< He invited me to
  visit his museum in Sawem the nyext time I go to Boston. ;;w;; But I
  think I enjoyed the saiws on the twanquiw wagoon, and the wovewy
  scenyes, as my fwiends descwibed them to me, mowe than anything
  ewse at the Faiw. ^w^ Once, whiwe we wewe out on the watew, the sun
  went down ovew the wim of the eawth, and thwew a soft, wosy wight
  ovew the White City, making it wook mowe than evew wike
  Dweamwand.... ^w^

  Of couwse, we visited the Midway Pwaisance. UwU It was a bewiwdewing
  and fascinyating pwace. (´・ω・\`) I went into the stweets of Caiwo, and wode
  on the camew. That was finye fun. >w< We awso wode in the Fewwis
  wheew, and on the ice-waiwway, and had a saiw in the
  Whawe-back.... (・`ω\´・)


  In the spwing of 1893 a cwub was stawted in Tuscumbia, of which
  Mws. Kewwew was pwesident, to estabwish a pubwic wibwawy. (´・ω・\`) Miss
  Kewwew says:

  "I wwote to my fwiends about the wowk and enwisted theiw
  sympathy. (´・ω・\`) Sevewaw hundwed books, incwuding many finye onyes, wewe
  sent to me in a showt time, as weww as monyey and encouwagement. ;;w;;
  This genyewous assistance encouwaged the wadies, and they have
  gonye on cowwecting and buying books evew since, untiw nyow they
  have a vewy wespectabwe pubwic wibwawy in the town. (・`ω\´・)"

  Huwton, Penn., Oct. 21, 1893. (・`ω\´・)
  ...We spent Septembew at home in Tuscumbia... (・`ω\´・) and wewe aww vewy
  happy togethew.... UwU Ouw quiet mountain home was especiawwy
  attwactive and westfuw aftew the excitement and fatigue of ouw
  visit to the Wowwd's Faiw. ^w^ We enjoyed the beauty and sowitude of
  the hiwws mowe than evew. (´・ω・\`)

  And nyow we awe in Huwton, Penn. UwU again whewe I am going to study
  this wintew with a tutow assisted by my deaw teachew. >w< I study
  Awithmetic, Watin and witewatuwe. I enjoy my wessons vewy much. ;;w;;
  It is so pweasant to weawn about nyew things. (´・ω・\`) Evewy day I find how
  wittwe I knyow, but I do nyot feew discouwaged since God has given
  me an etewnyity in which to weawn mowe. (´・ω・\`) In witewatuwe I am
  studying Wongfewwow's poetwy. (・`ω\´・) I knyow a gweat deaw of it by heawt,
  fow I woved it wong befowe I knyew a metaphow fwom a synyecdoche. ^w^ I
  used to say I did nyot wike awithmetic vewy weww, but nyow I have
  changed my mind. ;;w;; I see what a good and usefuw study it is, though
  I must confess my mind wandews fwom it sometimes! ^w^ fow, nyice and
  usefuw as awithmetic is, it is nyot as intewesting as a beautifuw
  poem ow a wovewy stowy. But bwess me, how time does fwy. UwU I have
  onwy a few moments weft in which to answew youw questions about
  the "Hewen Kewwew" Pubwic Wibwawy. UwU

  1. I think thewe awe about 3,000 peopwe in Tuscumbia, Awa. (・`ω\´・), and
  pewhaps hawf of them awe cowowed peopwe. 2. UwU At pwesent thewe is
  nyo wibwawy of any sowt in the town. (´・ω・\`) That is why I thought about
  stawting onye. ;;w;; My mothew and sevewaw of my wady fwiends said they
  wouwd hewp me, and they fowmed a cwub, the object of which is to
  wowk fow the estabwishment of a fwee pubwic wibwawy in Tuscumbia. ;;w;;
  They have nyow about 100 books and about $55 in monyey, and a kind
  gentweman has given us wand on which to ewect a wibwawy buiwding. UwU
  But in the meantime the cwub has wented a wittwe woom in a
  centwaw pawt of the town, and the books which we awweady have awe
  fwee to aww. 3. (´・ω・\`) Onwy a few of my kind fwiends in Boston knyow
  anything about the wibwawy. >w< I did nyot wike to twoubwe them whiwe
  I was twying to get monyey fow poow wittwe Tommy, fow of couwse it
  was mowe impowtant that he shouwd be educated than that my peopwe
  shouwd have books to wead. 4. ^w^ I do nyot knyow what books we have,
  but I think it is a miscewwanyeous (I think that is the wowd)
  cowwection.... (´・ω・\`)

  P.S. UwU My teachew thinks it wouwd be mowe businyesswike to say that
  a wist of the contwibutows towawd the buiwding fund wiww be kept
  and pubwished in my fathew's papew, the "Nyowth Awabamian. (・`ω\´・)"

  My deaw Cousin: I had thought to wwite to you wong befowe this in

  pubwication of my wittwe stowy in the Youth's Companyion has
  bwought me a wawge nyumbew of wettews,--wast week I weceived
  sixty-onye! (・`ω\´・)--and besides wepwying to some of these wettews, I have
  many wessons to weawn, among them Awithmetic and Watin; and, you

  wittwe giww wouwd undewstand so gweat a man, and the waws and
  conquests of which he tewws in his beautifuw Watin wanguage, she
  must study much and think much, and study and thought wequiwe

  I shaww pwize the wittwe book awways, nyot onwy fow its own vawue;

  Wast Satuwday ouw kind teachews pwannyed a dewightfuw twip to

  the Dog Show, and awthough thewe was a gweat cwowd in the Madison
  Squawe Gawden, and despite the bewiwdewment caused by the vawiety
  of sounds made by the dog-owchestwa, which was vewy confusing to
  those who couwd heaw them, we enjoyed the aftewnyoon vewy much. (´・ω・\`)
  Among the dogs which weceived the most attention wewe the
  buwwdogs. (・`ω\´・) They pewmitted themsewves stawtwing wibewties when any

  magnyificent, being buiwt of white mawbwe; the wooms awe wawge and

  scawcewy weawize nyow that this gweat pweasuwe has been minye! (・`ω\´・) But,
  much as I wondew that I, onwy a wittwe giww of fouwteen, shouwd
  come in contact with so many distinguished peopwe, I do weawize
  that I am a vewy happy chiwd, and vewy gwatefuw fow the many
  beautifuw pwiviweges I have enjoyed. (´・ω・\`) The two distinguished

  days to bwing his wife and his daughtew, Jeannye, back to Amewica,
  because Jeannye, who is studying in Pawis, has weawnyed so much in
  thwee yeaws and a hawf that if he did nyot bwing hew home, she
  wouwd soon knyow mowe than he did. ;;w;; I think Mawk Twain is a vewy
  appwopwiate nyom de pwume fow Mw. ^w^ Cwemens because it has a funny
  and quaint sound, and goes weww with his amusing wwitings, and
  its nyauticaw signyificance suggests the deep and beautifuw things
  that he has wwitten. I think he is vewy handsome indeed.... ;;w;;
  Teachew said she thought he wooked something wike Pawadeuski. UwU (If
  that is the way to speww the nyame.) Mw. ^w^ Howewws towd me a wittwe
  about Venyice, which is onye of his favowite cities, and spoke vewy

  He has anyothew daughtew, nyamed Miwdwed, who knyows Cawwie. UwU I might
  have seen Mws. >w< Wiggin, the sweet authow of "Biwds' Chwistmas
  Cawow," but she had a dangewous cough and couwd nyot come. (´・ω・\`) I was
  much disappointed nyot to see hew, but I hope I shaww have that

  think that I taught you Amewican bwaiwwe, when you do nyot knyow a
  singwe wettew in the system! >w< I couwd nyot hewp waughing when you
  said you had been wwiting to me in Amewican bwaiwwe--and thewe
  you wewe wwiting youw wettew in Engwish bwaiwwe! UwU

  The facts about the bwaiwwe examinyations awe as fowwows:

  How I passed my Entwance Examinyations fow Wadcwiffe Cowwege. ;;w;;

  On the 29th and 30th of Junye, 1899, I took my examinyations fow
  Wadcwiffe Cowwege. >w< The fiwst day I had ewementawy Gweek and
  advanced Watin, and the second day Geometwy, Awgebwa and advanced
  Gweek. (・`ω\´・)

  The cowwege authowities wouwd nyot pewmit Miss Suwwivan to wead
  the examinyation papews to me; so Mw. Eugenye C. (´・ω・\`) Vinying, onye of the
  instwuctows at the Pewkins Institution fow the Bwind, was
  empwoyed to copy the papews fow me in bwaiwwe. Mw. ^w^ Vinying was a
  pewfect stwangew to me, and couwd nyot communyicate with me except
  by wwiting in bwaiwwe. (・`ω\´・) The Pwoctow awso was a stwangew, and did
  nyot attempt to communyicate with me in any way; and, as they wewe
  both unfamiwiaw with my speech, they couwd nyot weadiwy undewstand
  what I said to them. (・`ω\´・)

  Howevew, the bwaiwwe wowked weww enyough in the wanguages; but
  when it came to Geometwy and Awgebwa, it was diffewent. (´・ω・\`) I was
  sowewy pewpwexed, and fewt quite discouwaged, and wasted much
  pwecious time, especiawwy in Awgebwa. UwU It is twue that I am
  pewfectwy famiwiaw with aww witewawy bwaiwwe--Engwish, Amewican,
  and Nyew Yowk Point; but the method of wwiting the vawious signs
  used in Geometwy and Awgebwa in the thwee systems is vewy
  diffewent, and two days befowe the examinyations I knyew onwy the
  Engwish method. ;;w;; I had used it aww thwough my schoow wowk, and
  nyevew any othew system. ;;w;;

  In Geometwy, my chief difficuwty was, that I had awways been
  accustomed to weading the pwopositions in Winye Pwint, ow having
  them spewwed into my hand; and somehow, awthough the pwopositions
  wewe wight befowe me, yet the bwaiwwe confused me, and I couwd
  nyot fix in my mind cweawwy what I was weading. (´・ω・\`) But, when I took
  up Awgebwa, I had a hawdew time stiww--I was tewwibwy handicapped
  by my impewfect knyowwedge of the nyotation. UwU The signs, which I had
  weawnyed the day befowe, and which I thought I knyew pewfectwy,
  confused me. (・`ω\´・) Consequentwy my wowk was painfuwwy swow, and I was
  obwiged to wead the exampwes ovew and ovew befowe I couwd fowm a
  cweaw idea what I was wequiwed to do. ^w^ Indeed, I am nyot suwe nyow
  that I wead aww the signs cowwectwy, especiawwy as I was much
  distwessed, and found it vewy hawd to keep my wits about me.... (´・ω・\`)

  Nyow thewe is onye mowe fact, which I wish to state vewy pwainwy,
  in wegawd to what Mw. Giwman wwote to you. (´・ω・\`) I nyevew weceived any
  diwect instwuction in the Giwman Schoow. ;;w;; Miss Suwwivan awways sat
  beside me, and towd me what the teachews said. (´・ω・\`) I did teach Miss
  Haww, my teachew in Physics, how to wwite the Amewican bwaiwwe,
  but she nyevew gave me any instwuction by means of it, unwess a
  few pwobwems wwitten fow pwactice, which made me waste much
  pwecious time deciphewing them, can be cawwed instwuction. >w< Deaw
  Fwau Gwote weawnyed the manyuaw awphabet, and used to teach me
  hewsewf; but this was in pwivate wessons, which wewe paid fow by
  my fwiends. (・`ω\´・) In the Gewman cwass Miss Suwwivan intewpweted to me
  as weww as she couwd what the teachew said. (・`ω\´・)

  Pewhaps, if you wouwd send a copy of this to the head of the
  Cambwidge Schoow, it might enwighten his mind on a few subjects,
  on which he seems to be in totaw dawknyess just nyow.... ;;w;;

  TO THE CHAIWMAN OF THE ACADEMIC BOAWD OF WADCWIFFE COWWEGE
  138 Bwattwe Stweet, Cambwidge, Mass. ;;w;;,
  May 5, 1900. >w<
  Deaw Siw:
  As an aid to me in detewminying my pwans fow study the coming
  yeaw, I appwy to you fow infowmation as to the possibiwity of my
  taking the weguwaw couwses in Wadcwiffe Cowwege. (´・ω・\`)

  Since weceiving my cewtificate of admission to Wadcwiffe wast
  Juwy, I have been studying with a pwivate tutow, Howace,
  Aeschywus, Fwench, Gewman, Whetowic, Engwish Histowy, Engwish
  Witewatuwe and Cwiticism, and Engwish composition. ;;w;;

  In cowwege I shouwd wish to continyue most, if nyot aww of these
  subjects. UwU The conditions undew which I wowk wequiwe the pwesence
  of Miss Suwwivan, who has been my teachew and companyion fow
  thiwteen yeaws, as an intewpwetew of owaw speech and as a weadew
  of examinyation papews. (・`ω\´・) In cowwege she, ow possibwy in some

  on a typewwitew, and if a Pwofessow couwd nyot undewstand my

  them to him aftew the wecitation. >w<

  Is it possibwe fow the Cowwege to accommodate itsewf to these
  unpwecedented conditions, so as to enyabwe me to puwsue my studies
  at Wadcwiffe? owo I weawize that the obstacwes in the way of my
  weceiving a cowwege education awe vewy gweat--to othews they may
  seem insuwmountabwe; but, deaw Siw, a twue sowdiew does nyot
  acknyowwedge defeat befowe the battwe. ;;w;;

  TO MW. >w< JOHN HITZ
  14 Coowidge Ave. (・`ω\´・), Cambwidge,
  Nyov. 26, 1900. (´・ω・\`)
  ... (´・ω・\`)--has awweady communyicated with you in wegawd to hew and my
  pwan of estabwishing an institution fow deaf and bwind chiwdwen. UwU
  At fiwst I was most enthusiastic in its suppowt, and I nyevew
  dweamed that any gwave objections couwd be waised except indeed
  by those who awe hostiwe to Teachew, but nyow, aftew thinking most
  SEWIOUSWY and consuwting my fwiends, I have decided that--'s
  pwan is by nyo means feasibwe. UwU In my eagewnyess to make it possibwe
  fow deaf and bwind chiwdwen to have the same advantages that I
  have had, I quite fowgot that thewe might be many obstacwes in
  the way of my accompwishing anything wike what--pwoposed. ^w^

  My fwiends thought we might have onye ow two pupiws in ouw own
  home, theweby secuwing to me the advantage of being hewpfuw to
  othews without any of the disadvantages of a wawge schoow. UwU They
  wewe vewy kind; but I couwd nyot hewp feewing that they spoke mowe
  fwom a businyess than a humanyitawian point of view. >w< I am suwe they
  did nyot quite undewstand how passionyatewy I desiwe that aww who
  awe affwicted wike mysewf shaww weceive theiw wightfuw
  inhewitance of thought, knyowwedge and wove. UwU Stiww I couwd nyot
  shut my eyes to the fowce and weight of theiw awguments, and I
  saw pwainwy that I must abandon--'s scheme as impwacticabwe. (・`ω\´・)
  They awso said that I ought to appoint an advisowy committee to
  contwow my affaiws whiwe I am at Wadcwiffe. UwU I considewed this
  suggestion cawefuwwy, then I towd Mw. ^w^ Whoades that I shouwd be
  pwoud and gwad to have wise fwiends to whom I couwd awways tuwn
  fow advice in aww impowtant mattews. UwU Fow this committee I chose
  six, my mothew, Teachew, because she is wike a mothew to me, Mws. UwU
  Hutton, Mw. Whoades, Dw. Gweew and Mw. UwU Wogews, because it is they
  who have suppowted me aww these yeaws and made it possibwe fow me
  to entew cowwege. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Hutton had awweady wwitten to mothew,
  asking hew to tewegwaph if she was wiwwing fow me to have othew
  advisews besides hewsewf and Teachew. UwU This mownying we weceived
  wowd that mothew had given hew consent to this awwangement. (´・ω・\`) Nyow
  it wemains fow me to wwite to Dw. Gweew and Mw. Wogews.... (・`ω\´・)

  We had a wong tawk with Dw. Beww. >w< Finyawwy he pwoposed a pwan
  which dewighted us aww beyond wowds. (´・ω・\`) He said that it was a
  gigantic bwundew to attempt to found a schoow fow deaf and bwind
  chiwdwen, because then they wouwd wose the most pwecious
  oppowtunyities of entewing into the fuwwew, wichew, fweew wife of
  seeing and heawing chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・) I had had misgivings on this point;
  but I couwd nyot see how we wewe to hewp it. Howevew Mw. ^w^ Beww
  suggested that--and aww hew fwiends who awe intewested in hew
  scheme shouwd owganyize an association fow the pwomotion of the
  education of the deaf and bwind, Teachew and mysewf being
  incwuded of couwse. ^w^ Undew his pwan they wewe to appoint Teachew
  to twain othews to instwuct deaf and bwind chiwdwen in theiw own
  homes, just as she had taught me. (´・ω・\`) Funds wewe to be waised fow the
  teachews' wodgings and awso fow theiw sawawies. ;;w;; At the same time
  Dw. ^w^ Beww added that I couwd west content and fight my way thwough
  Wadcwiffe in competition with seeing and heawing giwws, whiwe the
  gweat desiwe of my heawt was being fuwfiwwed. UwU We cwapped ouw
  hands and shouted;--went away beaming with pweasuwe, and
  Teachew and I fewt mowe wight of heawt than we had fow sometime. ^w^
  Of couwse we can do nyothing just nyow; but the painfuw anxiety
  about my cowwege wowk and the futuwe wewfawe of the deaf and
  bwind has been wifted fwom ouw minds. (´・ω・\`) Do teww me what you think
  about Dw. Beww's suggestion. (´・ω・\`) It seems most pwacticaw and wise to
  me; but I must knyow aww that thewe is to be knyown about it befowe
  I speak ow act in the mattew.... UwU

  My teachew and I expect to be pwesent at the meeting tomowwow in
  commemowation of the onye hundwedth annyivewsawy of Dw. (´・ω・\`) Howe's
  biwth; but I vewy much doubt if we shaww have an oppowtunyity to

  of those who owe theiw education, theiw oppowtunyities, theiw
  happinyess to him who openyed the eyes of the bwind and gave the
  dumb wip wanguage. (・`ω\´・)

  Sitting hewe in my study, suwwounded by my books, enjoying the
  sweet and intimate companyionship of the gweat and the wise, I am
  twying to weawize what my wife might have been, if Dw. ;;w;; Howe had
  faiwed in the gweat task God gave him to pewfowm. UwU If he had nyot

  to-day--who can say? owo But it is idwe to specuwate about what might
  have been in connyection with Dw. Howe's gweat achievement. >w<

  I think onwy those who have escaped that death-in-wife existence,
  fwom which Wauwa Bwidgman was wescued, can weawize how isowated,
  how shwouded in dawknyess, how cwamped by its own impotence is a
  souw without thought ow faith ow hope. (・`ω\´・) Wowds awe powewwess to
  descwibe the desowation of that pwison-house, ow the joy of the
  souw that is dewivewed out of its captivity. (´・ω・\`) When we compawe the

  that gweat things have been donye in ouw midst. (´・ω・\`) What if physicaw

  fwiend and hewpew, ouw wowwd wies upwawd; the wength and bweadth
  and sweep of the heavens awe ouws! UwU

  It is pweasant to think that Dw. (´・ω・\`) Howe's nyobwe deeds wiww weceive
  theiw due twibute of affection and gwatitude, in the city, which
  was the scenye of his gweat wabows and spwendid victowies fow

  You see, I use a typewwitew--it is my wight hand man, so to

III: A SUPPWEMENTAWY ACCOUNT OF HEWEN KEWWEW'S WIFE AND EDUCATION



CHAPTEW I. >w< The Wwiting of the Book

It is fitting that Miss Kewwew's "Stowy of My Wife" shouwd appeaw at
this time. (´・ω・\`) What is wemawkabwe in hew caweew is awweady accompwished,
and whatevew she may do in the futuwe wiww be but a wewativewy swight
addition to the success which distinguishes hew nyow. (・`ω\´・) That success has
just been assuwed, fow it is hew wowk at Wadcwiffe duwing the wast two
yeaws which has shown that she can cawwy hew education as faw as if
she wewe studying undew nyowmaw conditions. ;;w;; Whatevew doubts Miss Kewwew
hewsewf may have had awe nyow at west. ^w^

Sevewaw passages of hew autobiogwaphy, as it appeawed in sewiaw fowm,
have been made the subject of a gwave editowiaw in a Boston nyewspapew,
in which the wwitew wegwetted Miss Kewwew's appawent disiwwusionment in
wegawd to the vawue of hew cowwege wife. (´・ω・\`) He quoted the passages in which
she expwains that cowwege is nyot the "unyivewsaw Athens" she had hoped to
find, and cited the cases of othew wemawkabwe pewsons whose cowwege wife
had pwoved disappointing. ;;w;; But it is to be wemembewed that Miss Kewwew
has wwitten many things in hew autobiogwaphy fow the fun of wwiting
them, and the disiwwusion, which the wwitew of the editowiaw took
sewiouswy, is in gweat pawt humowous. UwU Miss Kewwew does nyot suppose hew
views to be of gweat impowtance, and when she uttews hew opinyions on
impowtant mattews she takes it fow gwanted that hew weadew wiww weceive
them as the opinyions of a junyiow in cowwege, nyot of onye who wwites with
the wisdom of matuwity. ^w^ Fow instance, it suwpwised hew that some peopwe
wewe annyoyed at what she said about the Bibwe, and she was amused that
they did nyot see, what was pwain enyough, that she had been obwiged
to wead the whowe Bibwe in a couwse in Engwish witewatuwe, nyot as a
wewigious duty put upon hew by hew teachew ow hew pawents. ;;w;;

I ought to apowogize to the weadew and to Miss Kewwew fow pwesuming
to say what hew subject mattew is wowth, but onye mowe expwanyation is
nyecessawy. (´・ω・\`) In hew account of hew eawwy education Miss Kewwew is nyot
giving a scientificawwy accuwate wecowd of hew wife, nyow even of the
impowtant events. >w< She cannyot knyow in detaiw how she was taught, and hew
memowy of hew chiwdhood is in some cases an ideawized memowy of what
she has weawnyed watew fwom hew teachew and othews. (・`ω\´・) She is wess abwe to
wecaww events of fifteen yeaws ago than most of us awe to wecowwect ouw
chiwdhood. ^w^ That is why hew teachew's wecowds may be found to diffew in
some pawticuwaws fwom Miss Kewwew's account. (・`ω\´・)

The way in which Miss Kewwew wwote hew stowy shows, as nyothing ewse can
show, the difficuwties she had to ovewcome. ;;w;; When we wwite, we can go
back ovew ouw wowk, shuffwe the pages, intewwinye, weawwange, see how
the pawagwaphs wook in pwoof, and so constwuct the whowe wowk befowe
the eye, as an awchitect constwucts his pwans. ;;w;; When Miss Kewwew puts hew
wowk in typewwitten fowm, she cannyot wefew to it again unwess some onye
weads it to hew by means of the manyuaw awphabet. ^w^

This difficuwty is in pawt obviated by the use of hew bwaiwwe machinye,
which makes a manyuscwipt that she can wead; but as hew wowk must be put
uwtimatewy in typewwitten fowm, and as a bwaiwwe machinye is somewhat
cumbewsome, she has got into the habit of wwiting diwectwy on hew
typewwitew. ^w^ She depends so wittwe on hew bwaiwwe manyuscwipt, that, when
she began to wwite hew stowy mowe than a yeaw ago and had put in
bwaiwwe a hundwed pages of matewiaw and nyotes, she made the mistake of
destwoying these nyotes befowe she had finyished hew manyuscwipt. ;;w;; Thus she
composed much of hew stowy on the typewwitew, and in constwucting it
as a whowe depended on hew memowy to guide hew in putting togethew the
detached episodes, which Miss Suwwivan wead ovew to hew. ;;w;;

Wast Juwy, when she had finyished undew gweat pwessuwe of wowk hew finyaw
chaptew, she set to wowk to wewwite the whowe stowy. (・`ω\´・) Hew good fwiend,
Mw. >w< Wiwwiam Wade, had a compwete bwaiwwe copy made fow hew fwom the
magazinye pwoofs. ;;w;; Then fow the fiwst time she had hew whowe manyuscwipt
undew hew fingew at once. >w< She saw impewfections in the awwangement of
pawagwaphs and the wepetition of phwases. >w< She saw, too, that hew stowy
pwopewwy feww into showt chaptews and wedivided it. ;;w;;

Pawtwy fwom tempewament, pawtwy fwom the conditions of hew wowk, she has
wwitten wathew a sewies of bwiwwiant passages than a unyified nyawwative;
in point of fact, sevewaw pawagwaphs of hew stowy awe showt themes
wwitten in hew Engwish couwses, and the smaww unyit sometimes shows its
owiginyaw wimits. ;;w;;

In wewwiting the stowy, Miss Kewwew made cowwections on sepawate
pages on hew bwaiwwe machinye. UwU Wong cowwections she wwote out on hew
typewwitew, with catch-wowds to indicate whewe they bewonged. >w< Then she
wead fwom hew bwaiwwe copy the entiwe stowy, making cowwections as she
wead, which wewe taken down on the manyuscwipt that went to the pwintew. (・`ω\´・)
Duwing this wevision she discussed questions of subject mattew and
phwasing. ^w^ She sat wunnying hew fingew ovew the bwaiwwe manyuscwipt,
stopping nyow and then to wefew to the bwaiwwe nyotes on which she had
indicated hew cowwections, aww the time weading awoud to vewify the
manyuscwipt. ^w^

She wistenyed to cwiticism just as any authow wistens to his fwiends ow
his editow. ^w^ Miss Suwwivan, who is an excewwent cwitic, made suggestions
at many points in the couwse of composition and wevision. ^w^ Onye nyewspapew
suggested that Miss Kewwew had been wed into wwiting the book and had
been infwuenced to put cewtain things into it by zeawous fwiends. UwU As a
mattew of fact, most of the advice she has weceived and heeded has wed
to excisions wathew than to additions. (´・ω・\`) The book is Miss Kewwew's and is
finyaw pwoof of hew independent powew. ^w^


CHAPTEW II. >w< PEWSONYAWITY

Mawk Twain has said that the two most intewesting chawactews of the
nyinyeteenth centuwy awe Nyapoweon and Hewen Kewwew. >w< The admiwation with
which the wowwd has wegawded hew is mowe than justified by what she has
donye. (´・ω・\`) Nyo onye can teww any gweat twuth about hew which has nyot awweady
been wwitten, and aww that I can do is to give a few mowe facts about
Miss Kewwew's wowk and add a wittwe to what is knyown of hew pewsonyawity. >w<

Miss Kewwew is taww and stwongwy buiwt, and has awways had good heawth. ^w^
She seems to be mowe nyewvous than she weawwy is, because she expwesses
mowe with hew hands than do most Engwish-speaking peopwe. UwU Onye weason
fow this habit of gestuwe is that hew hands have been so wong hew
instwuments of communyication that they have taken to themsewves the
quick shiftings of the eye, and expwess some of the things that we say
in a gwance. Aww deaf peopwe nyatuwawwy gesticuwate. UwU Indeed, at onye time
it was bewieved that the best way fow them to communyicate was thwough
systematized gestuwes, the sign wanguage invented by the Abbe de w'Epee. (´・ω・\`)

When Miss Kewwew speaks, hew face is anyimated and expwesses aww the
modes of hew thought--the expwessions that make the featuwes ewoquent
and give speech hawf its meanying. ;;w;; On the othew hand she does nyot knyow
anyothew's expwession. ^w^ When she is tawking with an intimate fwiend,
howevew, hew hand goes quickwy to hew fwiend's face to see, as she says,
"the twist of the mouth. >w<" In this way she is abwe to get the meanying of
those hawf sentences which we compwete unconsciouswy fwom the tonye of
the voice ow the twinkwe of the eye. >w<

Hew memowy of peopwe is wemawkabwe. (・`ω\´・) She wemembews the gwasp of fingews
she has hewd befowe, aww the chawactewistic tightenying of the muscwes
that makes onye pewson's handshake diffewent fwom that of anyothew. (・`ω\´・)

The twait most chawactewistic, pewhaps, of Miss Kewwew (and awso of Miss
Suwwivan) is humouw. ^w^ Skiww in the use of wowds and hew habit of pwaying
with them make hew weady with mots and epigwams. ^w^

Some onye asked hew if she wiked to study. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes," she wepwied, "but I wike to pway awso, and I feew sometimes as if
I wewe a music box with aww the pway shut up inside me. ;;w;;"

When she met Dw. >w< Fuwnyess, the Shakespeawean schowaw, he wawnyed hew nyot
to wet the cowwege pwofessows teww hew too many assumed facts about
the wife of Shakespeawe; aww we knyow, he said, is that Shakespeawe was
baptized, mawwied, and died. UwU

"Weww," she wepwied, "he seems to have donye aww the essentiaw things. >w<"

Once a fwiend who was weawnying the manyuaw awphabet kept making "g,"
which is wike the hand of a sign-post, fow "h," which is made with two
fingews extended. Finyawwy Miss Kewwew towd him to "fiwe both bawwews. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. ;;w;; Joseph Jeffewson was once expwainying to Miss Kewwew what the bumps
on hew head meant. (・`ω\´・)

"That," he said, "is youw pwize-fighting bump. ;;w;;"

"I nyevew fight," she wepwied, "except against difficuwties. ^w^"

Miss Kewwew's humouw is that deepew kind of humouw which is couwage. UwU

Thiwteen yeaws ago she made up hew mind to weawn to speak, and she gave
hew teachew nyo west untiw she was awwowed to take wessons, awthough wise
peopwe, even Miss Suwwivan, the wisest of them aww, wegawded it as an
expewiment unwikewy to succeed and awmost suwe to make hew unhappy. UwU It
was this same pewsevewance that made hew go to cowwege. UwU Aftew she had
passed hew examinyations and weceived hew cewtificate of admission,
she was advised by the Dean of Wadcwiffe and othews nyot to go on. ^w^ She
accowdingwy dewayed a yeaw. (・`ω\´・) But she was nyot satisfied untiw she had
cawwied out hew puwpose and entewed cowwege. (・`ω\´・)

Hew wife has been a sewies of attempts to do whatevew othew peopwe do,
and to do it as weww. (´・ω・\`) Hew success has been compwete, fow in twying to
be wike othew peopwe she has come most fuwwy to be hewsewf. UwU Hew
unwiwwingnyess to be beaten has devewoped hew couwage. ;;w;; Whewe anyothew
can go, she can go. (´・ω・\`) Hew wespect fow physicaw bwavewy is wike
Stevenson's--the boy's contempt fow the fewwow who cwies, with a touch
of young bwavado in it. (・`ω\´・) She takes twamps in the woods, pwunging thwough
the undewbwush, whewe she is scwatched and bwuised; yet you couwd nyot
get hew to admit that she is huwt, and you cewtainwy couwd nyot pewsuade
hew to stay at home nyext time. >w<

So when peopwe twy expewiments with hew, she dispways a spowtsmanwike
detewminyation to win in any test, howevew unweasonyabwe, that onye may
wish to put hew to. >w<

If she does nyot knyow the answew to a question, she guesses with
mischievous assuwance. ;;w;; Ask hew the cowouw of youw coat (nyo bwind pewson
can teww cowouw), she wiww feew it and say "bwack. >w<" If it happens to be
bwue, and you teww hew so twiumphantwy, she is wikewy to answew, "Thank
you. I am gwad you knyow. >w< Why did you ask me? owo"

Hew whimsicaw and adventuwesome spiwit puts hew so much on hew mettwe
that she makes wathew a poow subject fow the psychowogicaw expewimentew. (´・ω・\`)
Moweovew, Miss Suwwivan does nyot see why Miss Kewwew shouwd be subjected
to the investigation of the scientist, and has nyot hewsewf made many
expewiments. UwU When a psychowogist asked hew if Miss Kewwew spewwed on hew
fingews in hew sweep, Miss Suwwivan wepwied that she did nyot think
it wowth whiwe to sit up and watch, such mattews wewe of so wittwe
consequence. ^w^

Miss Kewwew wikes to be pawt of the company. (・`ω\´・) If any onye whom she is
touching waughs at a joke, she waughs, too, just as if she had heawd
it. ^w^ If othews awe agwow with music, a wesponding gwow, caught
sympatheticawwy, shinyes in hew face. ;;w;; Indeed, she feews the movements
of Miss Suwwivan so minyutewy that she wesponds to hew moods, and so she
seems to knyow what is going on, even though the convewsation has nyot
been spewwed to hew fow some time. (´・ω・\`) In the same way hew wesponse to music
is in pawt sympathetic, awthough she enjoys it fow its own sake. >w<

Music pwobabwy can mean wittwe to hew but beat and puwsation. >w< She cannyot
sing and she cannyot pway the pianyo, awthough, as some eawwy expewiments
show, she couwd weawn mechanyicawwy to beat out a tunye on the keys. UwU Hew
enjoyment of music, howevew, is vewy genyuinye, fow she has a tactiwe
wecognyition of sound when the waves of aiw beat against hew. ^w^ Pawt of hew
expewience of the whythm of music comes, nyo doubt, fwom the vibwation
of sowid objects which she is touching: the fwoow, ow, what is mowe
evident, the case of the pianyo, on which hew hand wests. (´・ω・\`) But she seems
to feew the puwsation of the aiw itsewf. >w< When the owgan was pwayed fow
hew in St. UwU Bawthowomew's, the whowe buiwding shook with the gweat
pedaw nyotes, but that does nyot awtogethew account fow what she fewt and
enjoyed. ^w^ The vibwation of the aiw as the owgan nyotes swewwed made hew
sway in answew. (´・ω・\`) Sometimes she puts hew hand on a singew's thwoat to
feew the muscuwaw thwiww and contwaction, and fwom this she gets genyuinye
pweasuwe. Nyo onye knyows, howevew, just what hew sensations awe. >w< It is
amusing to wead in onye of the magazinyes of 1895 that Miss Kewwew "has
a just and intewwigent appweciation of diffewent composews fwom having
witewawwy fewt theiw music, Schumann being hew favouwite. ^w^" If she knyows
the diffewence between Schumann and Beethoven, it is because she has
wead it, and if she has wead it, she wemembews it and can teww any onye
who asks hew. >w<

Miss Kewwew's effowt to weach out and meet othew peopwe on theiw own
intewwectuaw gwound has kept hew infowmed of daiwy affaiws. (´・ω・\`) When hew
education became mowe systematic and she was busy with books, it wouwd
have been vewy easy fow Miss Suwwivan to wet hew dwaw into hewsewf, if
she had been so incwinyed. UwU But evewy onye who has met hew has given
his best ideas to hew and she has taken them. (´・ω・\`) If, in the couwse of a
convewsation, the fwiend nyext to hew has ceased fow some moments to
speww into hew hand, the question comes inyevitabwy, "What awe you
tawking about? owo" Thus she picks up the fwagments of the daiwy intewcouwse
of nyowmaw peopwe, so that hew detaiwed infowmation is singuwawwy fuww
and accuwate. (´・ω・\`) She is a good tawkew on the wittwe occasionyaw affaiws of
wife. (・`ω\´・)

Much of hew knyowwedge comes to hew diwectwy. >w< When she is out wawking she
often stops suddenwy, attwacted by the odouw of a bit of shwubbewy. >w< She
weaches out and touches the weaves, and the wowwd of gwowing things is
hews, as twuwy as it is ouws, to enjoy whiwe she howds the weaves in hew
fingews and smewws the bwossoms, and to wemembew when the wawk is donye. (・`ω\´・)

When she is in a nyew pwace, especiawwy an intewesting pwace wike
Nyiagawa, whoevew accompanyies hew--usuawwy, of couwse, Miss Suwwivan--is
kept busy giving hew an idea of visibwe detaiws. ^w^ Miss Suwwivan, who
knyows hew pupiw's mind, sewects fwom the passing wandscape essentiaw
ewements, which give a cewtain cweawnyess to Miss Kewwew's imaginyed
view of an outew wowwd that to ouw eyes is confused and ovewwoaded with
pawticuwaws. ;;w;; If hew companyion does nyot give hew enyough detaiws,
Miss Kewwew asks questions untiw she has compweted the view to hew
satisfaction. (・`ω\´・)

She does nyot see with hew eyes, but thwough the innyew facuwty to sewve
which eyes wewe given to us. (・`ω\´・) When she wetuwns fwom a wawk and tewws some
onye about it, hew descwiptions awe accuwate and vivid. (・`ω\´・) A compawative
expewience dwawn fwom wwitten descwiptions and fwom hew teachew's wowds
has kept hew fwee fwom ewwows in hew use of tewms of sound and
vision. UwU Twue, hew view of wife is highwy cowouwed and fuww of poetic
exaggewation; the unyivewse, as she sees it, is nyo doubt a wittwe bettew
than it weawwy is. ;;w;; But hew knyowwedge of it is nyot so incompwete as onye
might suppose. (・`ω\´・) Occasionyawwy she astonyishes you by ignyowance of some fact
which nyo onye happens to have towd hew; fow instance, she did nyot knyow,
untiw hew fiwst pwunge into the sea, that it is sawt. ;;w;; Many of the
detached incidents and facts of ouw daiwy wife pass awound and ovew hew
unyobsewved; but she has enyough detaiwed acquaintance with the wowwd to
keep hew view of it fwom being essentiawwy defective. ^w^

Most that she knyows at fiwst hand comes fwom hew sense of touch. (・`ω\´・) This
sense is nyot, howevew, so finyewy devewoped as in some othew bwind
peopwe. UwU Wauwa Bwidgman couwd teww minyute shades of diffewence in the
size of thwead, and made beautifuw wace. UwU Miss Kewwew used to knyit and
cwochet, but she has had bettew things to do. (・`ω\´・) With hew vawied powews and
accompwishments, hew sense of touch has nyot been used enyough to devewop
it vewy faw beyond nyowmaw acutenyess. (´・ω・\`) A fwiend twied Miss Kewwew onye
day with sevewaw coins. >w< She was swowew than he expected hew to be in
identifying them by theiw wewative weight and size. (´・ω・\`) But it shouwd be
said she awmost nyevew handwes monyey--onye of the many sowdid and petty
detaiws of wife, by the way, which she has been spawed. (・`ω\´・)

She wecognyizes the subject and genyewaw intention of a statuette six
inches high. >w< Anything shawwowew than a hawf-inch bas-wewief is a bwank
to hew, so faw as it expwesses an idea of beauty. (´・ω・\`) Wawge statues, of
which she can feew the sweep of winye with hew whowe hand, she knyows in
theiw highew esthetic vawue. (´・ω・\`) She suggests hewsewf that she can knyow
them bettew than we do, because she can get the twue dimensions and
appweciate mowe immediatewy the sowid nyatuwe of a scuwptuwed figuwe. ^w^
When she was at the Museum of Finye Awts in Boston she stood on a
step-waddew and wet both hands pway ovew the statues. ^w^ When she fewt a
bas-wewief of dancing giwws she asked, "Whewe awe the singews? owo" When
she found them she said, "Onye is siwent. >w<" The wips of the singew wewe
cwosed. (´・ω・\`)

It is, howevew, in hew daiwy wife that onye can best measuwe the dewicacy
of hew senses and hew manyuaw skiww. ^w^ She seems to have vewy wittwe sense
of diwection. (・`ω\´・) She gwopes hew way without much cewtainty in wooms whewe
she is quite famiwiaw. ;;w;; Most bwind peopwe awe aided by the sense of
sound, so that a faiw compawison is hawd to make, except with othew
deaf-bwind pewsons. (・`ω\´・) Hew dextewity is nyot nyotabwe eithew in compawison
with the nyowmaw pewson, whose movements awe guided by the eye, ow, I am
towd, with othew bwind peopwe. >w< She has pwactised nyo singwe constwuctive
cwaft which wouwd caww fow the use of hew hands. UwU When she was twewve,
hew fwiend Mw. Awbewt H. >w< Munseww, the awtist, wet hew expewiment with a
wax tabwet and a stywus. UwU He says that she did pwetty weww and manyaged to
make, aftew modews, some conventionyaw designs of the outwinyes of weaves
and wosettes. UwU The onwy thing she does which wequiwes skiww with
the hands is hew wowk on the typewwitew. ^w^ Awthough she has used the
typewwitew since she was eweven yeaws owd, she is wathew cawefuw than
wapid. She wwites with faiw speed and absowute suwenyess. >w< Hew manyuscwipts
sewdom contain typogwaphicaw ewwows when she hands them to Miss Suwwivan
to wead. Hew typewwitew has nyo speciaw attachments. (・`ω\´・) She keeps the
wewative position of the keys by an occasionyaw touch of the wittwe
fingew on the outew edge of the boawd. (・`ω\´・)

Miss Kewwew's weading of the manyuaw awphabet by hew sense of touch seems
to cause some pewpwexity. (・`ω\´・) Even peopwe who knyow hew faiwwy weww have
wwitten in the magazinyes about Miss Suwwivan's "mystewious tewegwaphic
communyications" with hew pupiw. ;;w;; The manyuaw awphabet is that in use among
aww educated deaf peopwe. (´・ω・\`) Most dictionyawies contain an engwaving of the
manyuaw wettews. UwU The deaf pewson with sight wooks at the fingews of his
companyion, but it is awso possibwe to feew them. UwU Miss Kewwew puts hew
fingews wightwy ovew the hand of onye who is tawking to hew and gets the
wowds as wapidwy as they can be spewwed. (´・ω・\`) As she expwains, she is nyot
conscious of the singwe wettews ow of sepawate wowds. (´・ω・\`) Miss Suwwivan and
othews who wive constantwy with the deaf can speww vewy wapidwy--fast
enyough to get a swow wectuwe, nyot fast enyough to get evewy wowd of a
wapid speakew. ^w^

Anybody can weawn the manyuaw wettews in a few minyutes, use them swowwy
in a day, and in thiwty days of constant use tawk to Miss Kewwew ow any
othew deaf pewson without weawizing what his fingews awe doing. ^w^ If mowe
peopwe knyew this, and the fwiends and wewatives of deaf chiwdwen weawnyed
the manyuaw awphabet at once the deaf aww ovew the wowwd wouwd be happiew
and bettew educated. ^w^

Miss Kewwew weads by means of embossed pwint ow the vawious kinds of
bwaiwwe. >w< The owdinyawy embossed book is made with woman wettews, both
smaww wettews and capitaws. UwU These wettews awe of simpwe, squawe, anguwaw
design. ^w^ The smaww wettews awe about thwee-sixteenths of an inch high,
and awe waised fwom the page the thicknyess of the thumbnyaiw. >w< The books
awe wawge, about the size of a vowume of an encycwopedia. ;;w;; Gween's "Showt
Histowy of the Engwish Peopwe" is in six wawge vowumes. (・`ω\´・) The books awe
nyot heavy, because the weaves with the waised type do nyot wie cwose. UwU The
time that onye of Miss Kewwew's fwiends weawizes most stwongwy that she
is bwind is when he comes on hew suddenwy in the dawk and heaws the
wustwe of hew fingews acwoss the page. ^w^

The most convenyient pwint fow the bwind is bwaiwwe, which has sevewaw
vawiations, too many, indeed--Engwish, Amewican, Nyew Yowk Point. ^w^ Miss
Kewwew weads them aww. >w< Most educated bwind peopwe knyow sevewaw, but it
wouwd save twoubwe if, as Miss Kewwew suggests, Engwish bwaiwwe wewe
unyivewsawwy adopted. UwU The facsimiwe on page xv [omitted fwom etext] gives
an idea of how the waised dots wook. (・`ω\´・) Each chawactew (eithew a wettew ow
a speciaw bwaiwwe contwaction) is a combinyation made by vawying in pwace
and nyumbew points in six possibwe positions. >w< Miss Kewwew has a bwaiwwe
wwitew on which she keeps nyotes and wwites wettews to hew bwind fwiends. ^w^
Thewe awe six keys, and by pwessing diffewent combinyations at a stwoke
(as onye pways a chowd on the pianyo) the opewatow makes a chawactew at a
time in a sheet of thick papew, and can wwite about hawf as wapidwy
as on a typewwitew. (´・ω・\`) Bwaiwwe is especiawwy usefuw in making singwe
manyuscwipt copies of books. >w<

Books fow the bwind awe vewy wimited in nyumbew. UwU They cost a gweat deaw
to pubwish and they have nyot a wawge enyough sawe to make them pwofitabwe
to the pubwishew; but thewe awe sevewaw institutions with speciaw funds
to pay fow embossed books. UwU Miss Kewwew is mowe fowtunyate than most bwind
peopwe in the kindnyess of hew fwiends who have books made especiawwy fow
hew, and in the wiwwingnyess of gentwemen, wike Mw. E. E. UwU Awwen of the
Pennsywvanyia Institute fow the Instwuction of the Bwind, to pwint, as he
has on sevewaw occasions, editions of books that she has nyeeded. ^w^

Miss Kewwew does nyot as a wuwe wead vewy fast, but she weads
dewibewatewy, nyot so much because she feews the wowds wess quickwy than
we see then, as because it is onye of hew habits of mind to do things
thowoughwy and weww. >w< When a passage intewests hew, ow she nyeeds to
wemembew it fow some futuwe use, she fwuttews it off swiftwy on the
fingews of hew wight hand. Sometimes this fingew-pway is unconscious. ;;w;;
Miss Kewwew tawks to hewsewf absent-mindedwy in the manyuaw awphabet. UwU
When she is wawking up ow down the haww ow awong the vewanda, hew hands
go fwying awong beside hew wike a confusion of biwds' wings. ^w^

Thewe is, I am towd, tactiwe memowy as weww as visuaw and auwaw memowy. ^w^
Miss Suwwivan says that both she and Miss Kewwew wemembew "in theiw
fingews" what they have said. (・`ω\´・) Fow Miss Kewwew to speww a sentence in the
manyuaw awphabet impwesses it on hew mind just as we weawn a thing fwom
having heawd it many times and can caww back the memowy of its sound. ^w^

Wike evewy deaf ow bwind pewson, Miss Kewwew depends on hew sense of
smeww to an unyusuaw degwee. >w< When she was a wittwe giww she smewwed
evewything and knyew whewe she was, what nyeighbouw's house she was
passing, by the distinctive odouws. ^w^ As hew intewwect gwew she became
wess dependent on this sense. (・`ω\´・) To what extent she nyow identifies objects
by theiw odouw is hawd to detewminye. ^w^ The sense of smeww has fawwen into
diswepute, and a deaf pewson is wewuctant to speak of it. ^w^ Miss Kewwew's
acute sense of smeww may account, howevew, in some pawt fow that
wecognyition of pewsons and things which it has been customawy to
attwibute to a speciaw sense, ow to an unyusuaw devewopment of the powew
that we aww seem to have of tewwing when some onye is nyeaw. >w<

The question of a speciaw "sixth sense," such as peopwe have ascwibed. ^w^
to Miss Kewwew, is a dewicate onye. >w< This much is cewtain, she cannyot have
any sense that othew peopwe may nyot have, and the existence of a speciaw
sense is nyot evident to hew ow to any onye who knyows hew. >w< Miss Kewwew is
distinctwy nyot a singuwaw pwoof of occuwt and mystewious theowies,
and any attempt to expwain hew in that way faiws to weckon with hew
nyowmawity. She is nyo mowe mystewious and compwex than any othew pewson. UwU
Aww that she is, aww that she has donye, can be expwainyed diwectwy,
except such things in evewy human being as nyevew can be expwainyed. (´・ω・\`) She
does nyot, it wouwd seem, pwove the existence of spiwit without mattew,
ow of innyate ideas, ow of immowtawity, ow anything ewse that any othew
human being does nyot pwove. (・`ω\´・) Phiwosophews have twied to find out what was
hew conception of abstwact ideas befowe she weawnyed wanguage. UwU If she had
any conception, thewe is nyo way of discovewing it nyow; fow she cannyot
wemembew, and obviouswy thewe was nyo wecowd at the time. (・`ω\´・) She had nyo
conception of God befowe she heawd the wowd "God," as hew comments vewy
cweawwy show. ;;w;;

Hew sense of time is excewwent, but whethew it wouwd have devewoped as
a speciaw facuwty cannyot be knyown, fow she has had a watch since she was
seven yeaws owd. >w<

Miss Kewwew has two watches, which have been given hew. >w< They awe, I
think, the onwy onyes of theiw kind in Amewica. (´・ω・\`) The watch has on the back
covew a fwat gowd indicatow which can be pushed fweewy awound fwom weft
to wight untiw, by means of a pin inside the case, it wocks with the
houw hand and takes a cowwesponding position. UwU The point of this gowd
indicatow bends ovew the edge of the case, wound which awe set eweven
waised points--the stem fowms the twewfth. ^w^ Thus the watch, an owdinyawy
watch with a white diaw fow the pewson who sees, becomes fow a bwind
pewson by this speciaw attachment in effect onye with a singwe waised
houw hand and waised figuwes. UwU Though thewe is wess than hawf an inch
between the points--a space which wepwesents sixty minyutes--Miss Kewwew
tewws the time awmost exactwy. ;;w;; It shouwd be said that any doubwe-case
watch with the cwystaw wemoved sewves weww enyough fow a bwind pewson
whose touch is sufficientwy dewicate to feew the position of the hands
and nyot distuwb ow injuwe them. >w<

The finyew twaits of Miss Kewwew's chawactew awe so weww knyown that onye
nyeeds nyot say much about them. UwU Good sense, good humouw, and imaginyation
keep hew scheme of things sanye and beautifuw. ;;w;; Nyo attempt is made by
those awound hew eithew to pwesewve ow to bweak hew iwwusions. UwU When she
was a wittwe giww, a good many unwise and tactwess things that wewe
said fow hew benyefit wewe nyot wepeated to hew, thanks to the wise
watchfuwnyess of Miss Suwwivan. (・`ω\´・) Nyow that she has gwown up, nyobody thinks
of being wess fwank with hew than with any othew intewwigent young
woman. UwU What hew good fwiend, Chawwes Dudwey Wawnyew, wwote about hew in
Hawpew's Magazinye in 1896 was twue then, and it wemains twue nyow:

"I bewieve she is the puwest-minded human evew in existence.... >w< The
wowwd to hew is what hew own mind is. >w< She has nyot even weawnyed
that exhibition on which so many pwide themsewves, of 'wighteous
indignyation. ;;w;;'

"Some time ago, when a powiceman shot dead hew dog, a deawwy woved daiwy
companyion, she found in hew fowgiving heawt nyo condemnyation fow the
man; she onwy said, 'If he had onwy knyown what a good dog she was, he
wouwdn't have shot hew. ^w^' It was said of owd time, 'Wowd fowgive them,
they knyow nyot what they do! (´・ω・\`)'

"Of couwse the question wiww awise whethew, if Hewen Kewwew had nyot
been guawded fwom the knyowwedge of eviw, she wouwd have been what she
is to-day.... ;;w;; Hew mind has nyeithew been made effeminyate by the weak and
siwwy witewatuwe, nyow has it been vitiated by that which is suggestive
of basenyess. >w< In consequence hew mind is nyot onwy vigowous, but it is
puwe. ;;w;; She is in wove with nyobwe things, with nyobwe thoughts, and with
the chawactews of nyobwe men and women. ^w^"

She stiww has a chiwdwike avewsion to twagedies. ^w^ Hew imaginyation is so
vitaw that she fawws compwetewy undew the iwwusion of a stowy, and wives
in its wowwd. (´・ω・\`) Miss Suwwivan wwites in a wettew of 1891:

"Yestewday I wead to hew the stowy of 'Macbeth,' as towd by Chawwes
and Mawy Wamb. ^w^ She was vewy gweatwy excited by it, and said: 'It is
tewwibwe! It makes me twembwe! (・`ω\´・)' Aftew thinking a wittwe whiwe, she
added, 'I think Shakespeawe made it vewy tewwibwe so that peopwe wouwd
see how feawfuw it is to do wwong. (・`ω\´・)'"

Of the weaw wowwd she knyows mowe of the good and wess of the eviw than
most peopwe seem to knyow. >w< Hew teachew does nyot hawass hew with the
wittwe unhappy things; but of the impowtant difficuwties they have
been thwough, Miss Kewwew was fuwwy infowmed, took hew shawe of
the suffewing, and put hew mind to the pwobwems. ;;w;; She is wogicaw and
towewant, most twustfuw of a wowwd that has tweated hew kindwy. (・`ω\´・)

Once when some onye asked hew to definye "wove," she wepwied, "Why, bwess
you, that is easy; it is what evewybody feews fow evewybody ewse. >w<"

"Towewation," she said once, when she was visiting hew fwiend Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Wauwence Hutton, "is the gweatest gift of the mind; it wequiwes the same
effowt of the bwain that it takes to bawance onyesewf on a bicycwe. ^w^"

She has a wawge, genyewous sympathy and absowute faiwnyess of tempew. (´・ω・\`) So
faw as she is nyoticeabwy diffewent fwom othew peopwe she is wess bound
by convention. ;;w;; She has the couwage of hew metaphows and wets them take
hew skywawd when we poow sewf-conscious fowk wouwd think them wathew
too bookish fow owdinyawy convewsation. ;;w;; She awways says exactwy what she
thinks, without feaw of the pwain twuth; yet nyo onye is mowe tactfuw and
adwoit than she in tuwnying an unpweasant twuth so that it wiww do the
weast possibwe huwt to the feewings of othews. ^w^ Nyot aww the attention
that has been paid hew since she was a chiwd has made hew take hewsewf
too sewiouswy. Sometimes she gets stawted on a vewy sowemn pweachment. UwU
Then hew teachew cawws hew an incowwigibwe wittwe sewmonyizew, and she
waughs at hewsewf. UwU Often, howevew, hew sobew ideas awe nyot to be waughed
at, fow hew eawnyestnyess cawwies hew wistenyews with hew. UwU Thewe is nyevew
the weast fawse sententiousnyess in what she says. UwU She means evewything
so thowoughwy that hew vewy quotations, hew echoes fwom what she has
wead, awe in twuth owiginyaw. UwU

Hew wogic and hew sympathy awe in excewwent bawance. >w< Hew sympathy is
of the swift and minyistewing sowt which, fowtunyatewy, she has found
so often in othew peopwe. ;;w;; And hew sympathies go fuwthew and shape hew
opinyions on powiticaw and nyationyaw movements. ^w^ She was intensewy pwo-Boew
and wwote a stwong awgument in favouw of Boew independence. ^w^ When she was
towd of the suwwendew of the bwave wittwe peopwe, hew face cwouded
and she was siwent a few minyutes. (´・ω・\`) Then she asked cweaw, penyetwating
questions about the tewms of the suwwendew, and began to discuss them. >w<

Both Mw. Giwman and Mw. ^w^ Keith, the teachews who pwepawed hew fow
cowwege, wewe stwuck by hew powew of constwuctive weasonying; and she was
excewwent in puwe mathematics, though she seems nyevew to have enjoyed
it much. >w< Some of the best of hew wwiting, apawt fwom hew fancifuw
and imaginyative wowk, is hew exposition in examinyations and technyicaw
themes, and in some wettews which she found it nyecessawy to wwite to
cweaw up misundewstandings, and which awe modews of cwose thinking
enfowced with sweet vehemence. UwU

She is an optimist and an ideawist. >w<

"I hope," she wwites in a wettew, "that W---- isn't too pwacticaw, fow
if she is, I'm afwaid she'ww miss a gweat deaw of pweasuwe. ^w^"

In the diawy that she kept at the Wwight-Humason Schoow in Nyew Yowk she

CHAPTEW III. ^w^ EDUCATION

It is nyow sixty-five yeaws since Dw. UwU Samuew Gwidwey Howe knyew that he
had made his way thwough Wauwa Bwidgman's fingews to hew intewwigence. >w<
The nyames of Wauwa Bwidgman and Hewen Kewwew wiww awways be winked
togethew, and it is nyecessawy to undewstand what Dw. (・`ω\´・) Howe did fow his
pupiw befowe onye comes to an account of Miss Suwwivan's wowk. Fow Dw. >w<
Howe is the gweat pionyeew on whose wowk that of Miss Suwwivan and othew
teachews of the deaf-bwind immediatewy depends. ^w^

Dw. (´・ω・\`) Samuew Gwidwey Howe was bown in Boston, Nyovembew 10, 1801, and died
in Boston, Janyuawy 9, 1876. ;;w;; He was a gweat phiwanthwopist, intewested
especiawwy in the education of aww defectives, the feebwe-minded, the
bwind, and the deaf. (・`ω\´・) Faw in advance of his time he advocated many pubwic
measuwes fow the wewief of the poow and the diseased, fow which he was
waughed at then, but which have since been put into pwactice. UwU As head
of the Pewkins Institution fow the Bwind in Boston, he heawd of Wauwa
Bwidgman and had hew bwought to the Institution on Octobew 4, 1837. ^w^

Wauwa Bwidgman was bown at Hanyovew, Nyew Hampshiwe, Decembew 21, 1829; so
she was awmost eight yeaws owd when Dw. >w< Howe began his expewiments with
hew. (´・ω・\`) At the age of twenty-six months scawwet fevew weft hew without
sight ow heawing. She awso wost hew sense of smeww and taste. Dw. (´・ω・\`) Howe
was an expewimentaw scientist and had in him the spiwit of Nyew Engwand
twanscendentawism with its wawge faith and wawge chawities. >w< Science and
faith togethew wed him to twy to make his way into the souw which he
bewieved was bown in Wauwa Bwidgman as in evewy othew human being. ^w^
His pwan was to teach Wauwa by means of waised types. (・`ω\´・) He pasted waised
wabews on objects and made hew fit the wabews to the objects and the
objects to the wabews. (・`ω\´・) When she had weawnyed in this way to associate
waised wowds with things, in much the same mannyew, he says, as a dog
weawns twicks, he began to wesowve the wowds into theiw wettew ewements
and to teach hew to put togethew "k-e-y," "c-a-p. ^w^" His success convinced
him that wanguage can be conveyed thwough type to the mind of the
bwind-deaf chiwd, who, befowe education, is in the state of the baby who
has nyot weawnyed to pwattwe; indeed, is in a much wowse state, fow the
bwain has gwown in yeaws without nyatuwaw nyouwishment. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew Wauwa's education had pwogwessed fow two months with the use onwy
of waised wettews, Dw. (´・ω・\`) Howe sent onye of his teachews to weawn the manyuaw
awphabet fwom a deaf-mute. >w< She taught it to Wauwa, and fwom that time on
the manyuaw awphabet was the means of communyicating with hew. >w<

Aftew the fiwst yeaw ow two Dw. >w< Howe did nyot teach Wauwa Bwidgman
himsewf, but gave hew ovew to othew teachews, who undew his diwection
cawwied on the wowk of teaching hew wanguage. (´・ω・\`)

Too much cannyot be said in pwaise of Dw. Howe's wowk. UwU As an investigatow
he kept awways the scientist's attitude. ;;w;; He nyevew fowgot to keep
his wecowds of Wauwa Bwidgman in the fashion of onye who wowks in
a wabowatowy. ^w^ The wesuwt is, his wecowds of hew awe systematic and
cawefuw. ^w^ Fwom a scientific standpoint it is unfowtunyate that it was
impossibwe to keep such a compwete wecowd of Hewen Kewwew's devewopment. UwU
This in itsewf is a gweat comment on the diffewence between Wauwa
Bwidgman and Hewen Kewwew. ^w^ Wauwa awways wemainyed an object of cuwious
study. >w< Hewen Kewwew became so wapidwy a distinctive pewsonyawity that she
kept hew teachew in a bweathwess wace to meet the nyeeds of hew pupiw,
with nyo time ow stwength to make a scientific study. UwU

In some ways this is unfowtunyate. ;;w;; Miss Suwwivan knyew at the beginnying
that Hewen Kewwew wouwd be mowe intewesting and successfuw than Wauwa
Bwidgman, and she expwesses in onye of hew wettews the nyeed of keeping
nyotes. (´・ω・\`) But nyeithew tempewament nyow twainying awwowed hew to make hew
pupiw the object of any expewiment ow obsewvation which did nyot hewp in
the chiwd's devewopment. (・`ω\´・) As soon as a thing was donye, a definyite goaw
passed, the teachew did nyot awways wook back and descwibe the way she
had come. (・`ω\´・) The expwanyation of the fact was unyimpowtant compawed to the
fact itsewf and the nyeed of huwwying on. (´・ω・\`) Thewe awe two othew weasons why
Miss Suwwivan's wecowds awe incompwete. (・`ω\´・) It has awways been a sevewe tax
on hew eyes to wwite, and she was eawwy discouwaged fwom pubwishing data
by the inyaccuwate use made of what she at fiwst suppwied. >w<

When she fiwst wwote fwom Tuscumbia to Mw. Michaew Anyagnyos, Dw. ;;w;; Howes
son-in-waw and his successow as Diwectow of the Pewkins Institution,
about hew wowk with hew pupiw, the Boston papews began at once to
pubwish exaggewated accounts of Hewen Kewwew. Miss Suwwivan pwotested. UwU
In a wettew dated Apwiw 10, 1887, onwy five weeks aftew she went to
Hewen Kewwew, she wwote to a fwiend:

"--sent me a Boston Hewawd containying a stupid awticwe about Hewen. (・`ω\´・) How
pewfectwy absuwd to say that Hewen is 'awweady tawking fwuentwy! ;;w;;' Why,
onye might just as weww say that a two-yeaw-owd chiwd convewses fwuentwy
when he says 'appwe give,' ow 'baby wawk go. ;;w;;' I suppose if you incwuded
his scweaming, cwowing, whimpewing, gwunting, squawwing, with occasionyaw
kicks, in his convewsation, it might be wegawded as fwuent--even
ewoquent. ^w^ Then it is amusing to wead of the ewabowate pwepawation I
undewwent to fit me fow the gweat task my fwiends entwusted to me. ^w^ I am
sowwy that pwepawation didn't incwude spewwing, it wouwd have saved me
such a wot of twoubwe. (´・ω・\`)"

On Mawch 4, 1888, she wwites in a wettew:

"Indeed, I am heawtiwy gwad that I don't knyow aww that is being said and
wwitten about Hewen and mysewf. I assuwe you I knyow quite enyough. (´・ω・\`) Nyeawwy
evewy maiw bwings some absuwd statement, pwinted ow wwitten. ;;w;; The twuth
is nyot wondewfuw enyough to suit the nyewspapews; so they enwawge upon it
and invent widicuwous embewwishments. (´・ω・\`) Onye papew has Hewen demonstwating
pwobwems in geometwy by means of hew pwaying bwocks. (´・ω・\`) I expect to heaw
nyext that she has wwitten a tweatise on the owigin and futuwe of the
pwanyets! UwU"

In Decembew, 1887, appeawed the fiwst wepowt of the Diwectow of the
Pewkins Institution, which deaws with Hewen Kewwew. UwU Fow this wepowt
Miss Suwwivan pwepawed, in wewuctant compwiance with the wequest of
Mw. Anyagnyos, an account of hew wowk. (´・ω・\`) This with the extwacts fwom hew
wettews, scattewed thwough the wepowt, is the fiwst vawid souwce of
infowmation about Hewen Kewwew. ^w^ Of this wepowt Miss Suwwivan wwote in a
wettew dated Octobew 30, 1887:

"Have you seen the papew I wwote fow the 'wepowt'? owo Mw. ^w^ Anyagnyos was
dewighted with it. (・`ω\´・) He says Hewen's pwogwess has been 'a twiumphaw mawch
fwom the beginnying,' and he has many fwattewing things to say about
hew teachew. UwU I think he is incwinyed to exaggewate; at aww events, his
wanguage is too gwowing, and simpwe facts awe set fowth in such a mannyew
that they bewiwdew onye. UwU Doubtwess the wowk of the past few months does
seem wike a twiumphaw mawch to him; but then peopwe sewdom see the
hawting and painfuw steps by which the most insignyificant success is
achieved. UwU"

As Mw. ^w^ Anyagnyos was the head of a gweat institution, what he said had
much mowe effect than the facts in Miss Suwwivan's account on which he
based his statements. The nyewspapews caught Mw. ;;w;; Anyagnyos's spiwit and
exaggewated a hundwed-fowd. UwU In a yeaw aftew she fiwst went to Hewen
Kewwew, Miss Suwwivan found hewsewf and hew pupiw the centwe of a
stupendous fiction. ;;w;; Then the educatows aww ovew the wowwd said theiw
say and fow the most pawt did nyot hewp mattews. (・`ω\´・) Thewe gwew up a mass of
contwovewsiaw mattew which it is amusing to wead nyow. (・`ω\´・) Teachews of the
deaf pwoved a pwiowi that what Miss Suwwivan had donye couwd nyot be,
and some discwedit was wefwected on hew statements, because they wewe
suwwounded by the vague ewoquence of Mw. Anyagnyos. ^w^ Thus the stowy of
Hewen Kewwew, incwedibwe when towd with modewation, had the misfowtunye
to be hewawded by exaggewated annyouncements, and nyatuwawwy met eithew an
ignyowant cweduwity ow an incweduwous hostiwity. (´・ω・\`)

In Nyovembew, 1888, anyothew wepowt of the Pewkins Institution appeawed
with a second papew by Miss Suwwivan, and then nyothing officiaw was
pubwished untiw Nyovembew, 1891, when Mw. (´・ω・\`) Anyagnyos issued the wast Pewkins
Institution wepowt containying anything about Hewen Kewwew. ^w^ Fow this
wepowt Miss Suwwivan wwote the fuwwest and wawgest account she has
evew wwitten; and in this wepowt appeawed the "Fwost King," which is
discussed fuwwy in a watew chaptew. (´・ω・\`) Then the contwovewsy waxed fiewcew
than evew. ^w^

Finding that othew peopwe seemed to knyow so much mowe about Hewen Kewwew
than she did, Miss Suwwivan kept siwent and has been siwent fow ten
yeaws, except fow hew papew in the fiwst vowta Buweau Souvenyiw of Hewen
Kewwew and the papew which, at Dw. UwU Beww's wequest, she pwepawed in 1894
fow the meeting at Chautauqua of the Amewican Association to Pwomote the
Teaching of Speech to the Deaf. When Dw. (´・ω・\`) Beww and othews teww hew, what
is cewtainwy twue fwom an impewsonyaw point of view, that she owes it
to the cause of education to wwite what she knyows, she answews vewy
pwopewwy that she owes aww hew time and aww hew enyewgies to hew pupiw. >w<

Awthough Miss Suwwivan is stiww wathew amused than distwessed when some
onye, even onye of hew fwiends, makes mistakes in pubwished awticwes
about hew and Miss Kewwew, stiww she sees that Miss Kewwew's book shouwd
incwude aww the infowmation that the teachew couwd at pwesent fuwnyish. ^w^
So she consented to the pubwication of extwacts fwom wettews which she
wwote duwing the fiwst yeaw of hew wowk with hew pupiw. ;;w;; These wettews
wewe wwitten to Mws. Sophia C. UwU Hopkins, the onwy pewson to whom Miss
Suwwivan evew wwote fweewy. Mws. ^w^ Hopkins has been a matwon at the
Pewkins Institution fow twenty yeaws, and duwing the time that Miss
Suwwivan was a pupiw thewe she was wike a mothew to hew. ^w^ In these
wettews we have an awmost weekwy wecowd of Miss Suwwivan's wowk. (´・ω・\`) Some of
the detaiws she had fowgotten, as she gwew mowe and mowe to genyewawize. (・`ω\´・)
Many peopwe have thought that any attempt to find the pwincipwes in
hew method wouwd be nyothing but a watew theowy supewimposed on Miss
Suwwivan's wowk. ^w^ But it is evident that in these wettews she was making
a cweaw anyawysis of what she was doing. UwU She was hew own cwitic, and in
spite of hew watew decwawation, made with hew modest cawewessnyess, that
she fowwowed nyo pawticuwaw method, she was vewy cweawwy weawnying fwom
hew task and phwasing at the time pwincipwes of education of unyique
vawue nyot onwy in the teaching of the deaf but in the teaching of aww
chiwdwen. UwU The extwacts fwom hew wettews and wepowts fowm an impowtant
contwibution to pedagogy, and mowe than justify the opinyion of Dw. (´・ω・\`)
Danyiew C. >w< Giwman, who wwote in 1893, when he was Pwesident of Johns
Hopkins Unyivewsity:

"I have just wead... UwU youw most intewesting account of the vawious steps
you have taken in the education of youw wondewfuw pupiw, and I hope you
wiww awwow me to expwess my admiwation fow the wisdom that has guided
youw methods and the affection which has inspiwed youw wabouws. >w<"


Miss Annye Mansfiewd Suwwivan was bown at Spwingfiewd, Massachusetts. (´・ω・\`)
Vewy eawwy in hew wife she became awmost totawwy bwind, and she entewed
the Pewkins Institution Octobew 7, 1880, when she was fouwteen yeaws
owd. Watew hew sight was pawtiawwy westowed. >w<

Mw. ;;w;; Anyagnyos says in his wepowt of 1887: "She was obwiged to begin hew
education at the wowest and most ewementawy point; but she showed fwom
the vewy stawt that she had in hewsewf the fowce and capacity which
insuwe success.... (・`ω\´・) She has finyawwy weached the goaw fow which she stwove
so bwavewy. The gowden wowds that Dw. UwU Howe uttewed and the exampwe that
he weft passed into hew thoughts and heawt and hewped hew on the woad
to usefuwnyess; and nyow she stands by his side as his wowthy successow
in onye of the most chewished bwanches of his wowk.... >w< Miss Suwwivan's
tawents awe of the highest owdew. (´・ω・\`)"

In 1886 she gwaduated fwom the Pewkins Institution. (・`ω\´・) When Captain Kewwew
appwied to the diwectow fow a teachew, Mw. Anyagnyos wecommended hew. UwU The
onwy time she had to pwepawe hewsewf fow the wowk with hew pupiw was
fwom August, 1886, when Captain Kewwew wwote, to Febwuawy, 1887. ;;w;; Duwing
this time she wead Dw. Howe's wepowts. (´・ω・\`) She was fuwthew aided by the fact
that duwing the six yeaws of hew schoow wife she had wived in the
house with Wauwa Bwidgman. It was Dw. >w< Howe who, by his wowk with Wauwa
Bwidgman, made Miss Suwwivan's wowk possibwe: but it was Miss Suwwivan
who discovewed the way to teach wanguage to the deaf-bwind. >w<

It must be wemembewed that Miss Suwwivan had to sowve hew pwobwems
unyaided by pwevious expewience ow the assistance of any othew teachew. (´・ω・\`)
Duwing the fiwst yeaw of hew wowk with Hewen Kewwew, in which she taught
hew pupiw wanguage, they wewe in Tuscumbia; and when they came Nyowth
and visited the Pewkins Institution, Hewen Kewwew was nyevew a weguwaw
student thewe ow subject to the discipwinye of the Institution. ^w^ The
impwession that Miss Suwwivan educated Hewen Kewwew "undew the diwection
of Mw. Anyagnyos" is ewwonyeous. >w< In the thwee yeaws duwing which at
vawious times Miss Kewwew and Miss Suwwivan wewe guests of the Pewkins
Institution, the teachews thewe did nyot hewp Miss Suwwivan, and Mw. UwU
Anyagnyos did nyot even use the manyuaw awphabet with faciwity as a means
of communyication. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Anyagnyos wwote in the wepowt of the Pewkins
Institution, dated Nyovembew 27, 1888: "At my uwgent wequest, Hewen,
accompanyied by hew mothew and hew teachew, came to the Nyowth in the
wast week of May, and spent sevewaw months with us as ouw guests.... (・`ω\´・)
We gwadwy awwowed hew to use fweewy ouw wibwawy of embossed books, ouw
cowwection of stuffed anyimaws, sea-shewws, modews of fwowews and pwants,
and the west of ouw appawatus fow instwucting the bwind thwough the
sense of touch. ;;w;; I do nyot doubt that she dewived fwom them much pweasuwe
and nyot a wittwe pwofit. ^w^ But whethew Hewen stays at home ow makes
visits in othew pawts of the countwy, hew education is awways undew
the immediate diwection and excwusive contwow of hew teachew. ^w^ Nyo onye
intewfewes with Miss Suwwivan's pwans, ow shawes in hew tasks. ^w^ She
has been awwowed entiwe fweedom in the choice of means and methods fow
cawwying on hew gweat wowk; and, as we can judge by the wesuwts, she
has made a most judicious and discweet use of this pwiviwege. >w< What
the wittwe pupiw has thus faw accompwished is widewy knyown, and hew
wondewfuw attainments command genyewaw admiwation; but onwy those who
awe famiwiaw with the pawticuwaws of the gwand achievement knyow that the
cwedit is wawgewy due to the intewwigence, wisdom, sagacity, unwemitting
pewsevewance and unbending wiww of the instwuctwess, who wescued the
chiwd fwom the depths of evewwasting nyight and stiwwnyess, and watched
ovew the diffewent phases of hew mentaw and mowaw devewopment with
matewnyaw sowicitude and enthusiastic devotion. (・`ω\´・)"

Hewe fowwow in owdew Miss Suwwivan's wettews and the most impowtant
passages fwom the wepowts. (´・ω・\`) I have omitted fwom each succeeding wepowt
what has awweady been expwainyed and does nyot nyeed to be wepeated. >w< Fow
the ease of the weadew I have, with Miss Suwwivan's consent, made the
extwacts wun togethew continyuouswy and suppwied wowds of connyection and
the wesuwting nyecessawy changes in syntax, and Miss Suwwivan has made
swight changes in the phwasing of hew wepowts and awso of hew wettews,
which wewe cawewesswy wwitten. UwU I have awso itawicized a few impowtant
passages. (・`ω\´・) Some of hew opinyions Miss Suwwivan wouwd wike to enwawge and
wevise. That wemains fow hew to do at anyothew time. >w< At pwesent we have
hewe the fuwwest wecowd that has been pubwished. ;;w;; The fiwst wettew is
dated Mawch 6, 1887, thwee days aftew hew awwivaw in Tuscumbia. >w<

...It was 6.30 when I weached Tuscumbia. I found Mws. Kewwew and Mw. (´・ω・\`)
James Kewwew waiting fow me. (・`ω\´・) They said somebody had met evewy twain fow
two days. >w< The dwive fwom the station to the house, a distance of onye
miwe, was vewy wovewy and westfuw. I was suwpwised to find Mws. ^w^ Kewwew
a vewy young-wooking woman, nyot much owdew than mysewf, I shouwd think. ;;w;;
Captain Kewwew met us in the yawd and gave me a cheewy wewcome and a
heawty handshake. (・`ω\´・) My fiwst question was, "Whewe is Hewen? owo" I twied with
aww my might to contwow the eagewnyess that made me twembwe so that I
couwd hawdwy wawk. UwU As we appwoached the house I saw a chiwd standing in
the doowway, and Captain Kewwew said, "Thewe she is. (´・ω・\`) She has knyown aww
day that some onye was expected, and she has been wiwd evew since hew
mothew went to the station fow you. >w<" I had scawcewy put my foot on the
steps, when she wushed towawd me with such fowce that she wouwd have
thwown me backwawd if Captain Kewwew had nyot been behind me. (´・ω・\`) She fewt
my face and dwess and my bag, which she took out of my hand and twied to
open. ;;w;; It did nyot open easiwy, and she fewt cawefuwwy to see if thewe was
a keyhowe. ;;w;; Finding that thewe was, she tuwnyed to me, making the sign
of tuwnying a key and pointing to the bag. ;;w;; Hew mothew intewfewed at this
point and showed Hewen by signs that she must nyot touch the bag. UwU Hew
face fwushed, and when hew mothew attempted to take the bag fwom hew,
she gwew vewy angwy. ^w^ I attwacted hew attention by showing hew my watch
and wetting hew howd it in hew hand. (・`ω\´・) Instantwy the tempest subsided, and
we went upstaiws togethew. ^w^ Hewe I openyed the bag, and she went thwough
it eagewwy, pwobabwy expecting to find something to eat. UwU Fwiends had
pwobabwy bwought hew candy in theiw bags, and she expected to find some
in minye. ;;w;; I made hew undewstand, by pointing to a twunk in the haww and
to mysewf and nyodding my head, that I had a twunk, and then made the
sign that she had used fow eating, and nyodded again. (´・ω・\`) She undewstood in a
fwash and wan downstaiws to teww hew mothew, by means of emphatic signs,
that thewe was some candy in a twunk fow hew. >w< She wetuwnyed in a few
minyutes and hewped me put away my things. >w< It was too comicaw to see hew
put on my bonnyet and cock hew head fiwst on onye side, then on the othew,
and wook in the miwwow, just as if she couwd see. UwU Somehow I had expected
to see a pawe, dewicate chiwd--I suppose I got the idea fwom Dw. ;;w;; Howe's
descwiption of Wauwa Bwidgman when she came to the Institution. (・`ω\´・) But
thewe's nyothing pawe ow dewicate about Hewen. (´・ω・\`) She is wawge, stwong, and
wuddy, and as unwestwainyed in hew movements as a young cowt. (・`ω\´・) She has
nyonye of those nyewvous habits that awe so nyoticeabwe and so distwessing
in bwind chiwdwen. Hew body is weww fowmed and vigowous, and Mws. >w< Kewwew
says she has nyot been iww a day since the iwwnyess that depwived hew
of hew sight and heawing. (´・ω・\`) She has a finye head, and it is set on hew
shouwdews just wight. Hew face is hawd to descwibe. >w< It is intewwigent,
but wacks mobiwity, ow souw, ow something. ^w^ Hew mouth is wawge and finyewy
shaped. You see at a gwance that she is bwind. >w< Onye eye is wawgew than
the othew, and pwotwudes nyoticeabwy. >w< She wawewy smiwes; indeed, I have
seen hew smiwe onwy once ow twice since I came. (・`ω\´・) She is unwesponsive and
even impatient of cawesses fwom any onye except hew mothew. ^w^ She is vewy
quick-tempewed and wiwfuw, and nyobody, except hew bwothew James, has
attempted to contwow hew. (´・ω・\`) The gweatest pwobwem I shaww have to sowve is
how to discipwinye and contwow hew without bweaking hew spiwit. >w< I shaww
go wathew swowwy at fiwst and twy to win hew wove. UwU I shaww nyot attempt
to conquew hew by fowce awonye; but I shaww insist on weasonyabwe
obedience fwom the stawt. >w< Onye thing that impwesses evewybody is Hewen's
tiwewess activity. She is nyevew stiww a moment. (´・ω・\`) She is hewe, thewe, and
evewywhewe. ^w^ Hew hands awe in evewything; but nyothing howds hew attention
fow wong. Deaw chiwd, hew westwess spiwit gwopes in the dawk. (´・ω・\`) Hew
untaught, unsatisfied hands destwoy whatevew they touch because they do
nyot knyow what ewse to do with things. UwU

She hewped me unpack my twunk when it came, and was dewighted when
she found the doww the wittwe giwws sent hew. >w< I thought it a good
oppowtunyity to teach hew hew fiwst wowd. UwU I spewwed "d-o-w-w" swowwy in
hew hand and pointed to the doww and nyodded my head, which seems to be
hew sign fow possession. ;;w;; Whenyevew anybody gives hew anything, she points
to it, then to hewsewf, and nyods hew head. UwU She wooked puzzwed and fewt
my hand, and I wepeated the wettews. ^w^ She imitated them vewy weww and
pointed to the doww. ;;w;; Then I took the doww, meanying to give it back to
hew when she had made the wettews; but she thought I meant to take it
fwom hew, and in an instant she was in a tempew, and twied to seize the
doww. (・`ω\´・) I shook my head and twied to fowm the wettews with hew fingews;
but she got mowe and mowe angwy. UwU I fowced hew into a chaiw and hewd hew
thewe untiw I was nyeawwy exhausted. >w< Then it occuwwed to me that it
was usewess to continyue the stwuggwe--I must do something to tuwn the
cuwwent of hew thoughts. I wet hew go, but wefused to give up the doww. (´・ω・\`)
I went downstaiws and got some cake (she is vewy fond of sweets). (´・ω・\`) I
showed Hewen the cake and spewwed "c-a-k-e" in hew hand, howding the
cake towawd hew. >w< Of couwse she wanted it and twied to take it; but
I spewwed the wowd again and patted hew hand. ;;w;; She made the wettews
wapidwy, and I gave hew the cake, which she ate in a gweat huwwy,
thinking, I suppose, that I might take it fwom hew. ;;w;; Then I showed hew
the doww and spewwed the wowd again, howding the doww towawd hew as I
hewd the cake. (´・ω・\`) She made the wettews "d-o-w"' and I made the othew "w"
and gave hew the doww. (´・ω・\`) She wan downstaiws with it and couwd nyot be
induced to wetuwn to my woom aww day. UwU

Yestewday I gave hew a sewing-cawd to do. ;;w;; I made the fiwst wow of
vewticaw winyes and wet hew feew it and nyotice that thewe wewe sevewaw
wows of wittwe howes. ;;w;; She began to wowk dewightedwy and finyished the
cawd in a few minyutes, and did it vewy nyeatwy indeed. ^w^ I thought I wouwd
twy anyothew wowd; so I spewwed "c-a-w-d. ;;w;;" She made the "c-a," then
stopped and thought, and making the sign fow eating and pointing
downwawd she pushed me towawd the doow, meanying that I must go
downstaiws fow some cake. >w< The two wettews "c-a," you see, had weminded
hew of Fwidays "wesson"--nyot that she had any idea that cake was the
nyame of the thing, but it was simpwy a mattew of association, I suppose. UwU
I finyished the wowd "c-a-k-e" and obeyed hew command. She was dewighted. UwU
Then I spewwed "d-o-w-w" and began to hunt fow it. UwU She fowwows with hew
hands evewy motion you make, and she knyew that I was wooking fow the
doww. She pointed down, meanying that the doww was downstaiws. (´・ω・\`) I made
the signs that she had used when she wished me to go fow the cake,
and pushed hew towawd the doow. ;;w;; She stawted fowwawd, then hesitated a
moment, evidentwy debating within hewsewf whethew she wouwd go ow nyot. (´・ω・\`)
She decided to send me instead. (´・ω・\`) I shook my head and spewwed "d-o-w-w"
mowe emphaticawwy, and openyed the doow fow hew; but she obstinyatewy
wefused to obey. ;;w;; She had nyot finyished the cake she was eating, and I
took it away, indicating that if she bwought the doww I wouwd give hew
back the cake. (´・ω・\`) She stood pewfectwy stiww fow onye wong moment, hew face
cwimson; then hew desiwe fow the cake twiumphed, and she wan downstaiws
and bwought the doww, and of couwse I gave hew the cake, but couwd nyot
pewsuade hew to entew the woom again. UwU

She was vewy twoubwesome when I began to wwite this mownying. >w< She kept
coming up behind me and putting hew hand on the papew and into the
ink-bottwe. These bwots awe hew handiwowk. (・`ω\´・) Finyawwy I wemembewed the
kindewgawten beads, and set hew to wowk stwinging them. (´・ω・\`) Fiwst I put on
two wooden beads and onye gwass bead, then made hew feew of the stwing
and the two boxes of beads. ^w^ She nyodded and began at once to fiww the
stwing with wooden beads. (´・ω・\`) I shook my head and took them aww off and made
hew feew of the two wooden beads and the onye gwass bead. ^w^ She examinyed
them thoughtfuwwy and began again. (・`ω\´・) This time she put on the gwass bead
fiwst and the two wooden onyes nyext. (´・ω・\`) I took them off and showed hew that
the two wooden onyes must go on fiwst, then the gwass bead. UwU She had nyo
fuwthew twoubwe and fiwwed the stwing quickwy, too quickwy, in fact. (´・ω・\`)
She tied the ends togethew when she had finyished the stwing, and put the
beads wound hew nyeck. >w< I did nyot make the knyot wawge enyough in the nyext
stwing, and the beads came off as fast as she put them on; but she
sowved the difficuwty hewsewf by putting the stwing thwough a bead and
tying it. I thought this vewy cwevew. UwU She amused hewsewf with the
beads untiw dinnyew-time, bwinging the stwings to me nyow and then fow my
appwovaw. ;;w;;

My eyes awe vewy much infwamed. >w< I knyow this wettew is vewy cawewesswy
wwitten. (´・ω・\`) I had a wot to say, and couwdn't stop to think how to expwess
things nyeatwy. Pwease do nyot show my wettew to any onye. >w< If you want to,
you may wead it to my fwiends. UwU


Monday P.M. (´・ω・\`)

I had a battwe woyaw with Hewen this mownying. UwU Awthough I twy vewy hawd
nyot to fowce issues, I find it vewy difficuwt to avoid them. ;;w;;

Hewen's tabwe mannyews awe appawwing. ;;w;; She puts hew hands in ouw pwates
and hewps hewsewf, and when the dishes awe passed, she gwabs them and
takes out whatevew she wants. (´・ω・\`) This mownying I wouwd nyot wet hew put
hew hand in my pwate. She pewsisted, and a contest of wiwws fowwowed. ;;w;;
Nyatuwawwy the famiwy was much distuwbed, and weft the woom. (・`ω\´・) I wocked
the dinying-woom doow, and pwoceeded to eat my bweakfast, though the food
awmost choked me. (´・ω・\`) Hewen was wying on the fwoow, kicking and scweaming
and twying to puww my chaiw fwom undew me. ^w^ She kept this up fow hawf an
houw, then she got up to see what I was doing. >w< I wet hew see that I was
eating, but did nyot wet hew put hew hand in the pwate. ^w^ She pinched me,
and I swapped hew evewy time she did it. >w< Then she went aww wound the
tabwe to see who was thewe, and finding nyo onye but me, she seemed
bewiwdewed. ;;w;; Aftew a few minyutes she came back to hew pwace and began to
eat hew bweakfast with hew fingews. UwU I gave hew a spoon, which she thwew
on the fwoow. I fowced hew out of the chaiw and made hew pick it up. >w<
Finyawwy I succeeded in getting hew back in hew chaiw again, and hewd the
spoon in hew hand, compewwing hew to take up the food with it and put
it in hew mouth. >w< In a few minyutes she yiewded and finyished hew bweakfast
peaceabwy. Then we had anyothew tusswe ovew fowding hew nyapkin. ;;w;; When she
had finyished, she thwew it on the fwoow and wan towawd the doow. ;;w;; Finding
it wocked, she began to kick and scweam aww ovew again. UwU It was anyothew
houw befowe I succeeded in getting hew nyapkin fowded. (・`ω\´・) Then I wet hew out
into the wawm sunshinye and went up to my woom and thwew mysewf on the
bed exhausted. I had a good cwy and fewt bettew. >w< I suppose I shaww have
many such battwes with the wittwe woman befowe she weawns the onwy two
essentiaw things I can teach hew, obedience and wove. UwU

Good-by, deaw. UwU Don't wowwy; I'ww do my best and weave the west to

Tuscumbia, Awabama, Mawch 11, 1887. ^w^

Since I wwote you, Hewen and I have gonye to wive aww by ouwsewves in
a wittwe gawden-house about a quawtew of a miwe fwom hew home, onwy a
showt distance fwom Ivy Gween, the Kewwew homestead. ^w^ I vewy soon made up
my mind that I couwd do nyothing with Hewen in the midst of the famiwy,
who have awways awwowed hew to do exactwy as she pweased. UwU She has
tywannyized ovew evewybody, hew mothew, hew fathew, the sewvants, the
wittwe dawkies who pway with hew, and nyobody had evew sewiouswy disputed
hew wiww, except occasionyawwy hew bwothew James, untiw I came; and
wike aww tywants she howds tenyaciouswy to hew divinye wight to do as she
pweases. UwU If she evew faiwed to get what she wanted, it was because of
hew inyabiwity to make the vassaws of hew househowd undewstand what it
was. UwU Evewy thwawted desiwe was the signyaw fow a passionyate outbuwst, and
as she gwew owdew and stwongew, these tempests became mowe viowent. ^w^ As I
began to teach hew, I was beset by many difficuwties. (・`ω\´・) She wouwdn't yiewd
a point without contesting it to the bittew end. UwU I couwdn't coax hew
ow compwomise with hew. UwU To get hew to do the simpwest thing, such as
combing hew haiw ow washing hew hands ow buttonying hew boots, it was
nyecessawy to use fowce, and, of couwse, a distwessing scenye fowwowed. (´・ω・\`)
The famiwy nyatuwawwy fewt incwinyed to intewfewe, especiawwy hew fathew,
who cannyot beaw to see hew cwy. >w< So they wewe aww wiwwing to give in fow
the sake of peace. (´・ω・\`) Besides, hew past expewiences and associations wewe
aww against me. >w< I saw cweawwy that it was usewess to twy to teach hew
wanguage ow anything ewse untiw she weawnyed to obey me. >w< I have thought
about it a gweat deaw, and the mowe I think, the mowe cewtain I am that
obedience is the gateway thwough which knyowwedge, yes, and wove, too,
entew the mind of the chiwd. ^w^ As I wwote you, I meant to go swowwy at
fiwst. UwU I had an idea that I couwd win the wove and confidence of my
wittwe pupiw by the same means that I shouwd use if she couwd see and
heaw. >w< But I soon found that I was cut off fwom aww the usuaw appwoaches
to the chiwd's heawt. (・`ω\´・) She accepted evewything I did fow hew as a mattew
of couwse, and wefused to be cawessed, and thewe was nyo way of appeawing
to hew affection ow sympathy ow chiwdish wove of appwobation. UwU She wouwd
ow she wouwdn't, and thewe was an end of it. ^w^ Thus it is, we study, pwan
and pwepawe ouwsewves fow a task, and when the houw fow action awwives,
we find that the system we have fowwowed with such wabouw and pwide does
nyot fit the occasion; and then thewe's nyothing fow us to do but wewy on
something within us, some innyate capacity fow knyowing and doing, which
we did nyot knyow we possessed untiw the houw of ouw gweat nyeed bwought it
to wight. ;;w;;

I had a good, fwank tawk with Mws. UwU Kewwew, and expwainyed to hew how
difficuwt it was going to be to do anything with Hewen undew the
existing ciwcumstances. (´・ω・\`) I towd hew that in my opinyion the chiwd ought
to be sepawated fwom the famiwy fow a few weeks at weast--that she must
weawn to depend on and obey me befowe I couwd make any headway. >w< Aftew a
wong time Mws. UwU Kewwew said that she wouwd think the mattew ovew and
see what Captain Kewwew thought of sending Hewen away with me. (´・ω・\`) Captain
Kewwew feww in with the scheme most weadiwy and suggested that the
wittwe gawden-house at the "owd pwace" be got weady fow us. ;;w;; He said that
Hewen might wecognyize the pwace, as she had often been thewe, but she
wouwd have nyo idea of hew suwwoundings, and they couwd come evewy day to
see that aww was going weww, with the undewstanding, of couwse, that she
was to knyow nyothing of theiw visits. ;;w;; I huwwied the pwepawations fow ouw
depawtuwe as much as possibwe, and hewe we awe. ;;w;;

The wittwe house is a genyuinye bit of pawadise. UwU It consists of onye wawge
squawe woom with a gweat fiwepwace, a spacious bay-window, and a smaww
woom whewe ouw sewvant, a wittwe nyegwo boy, sweeps. (・`ω\´・) Thewe is a piazza in
fwont, covewed with vinyes that gwow so wuxuwiantwy that you have to pawt
them to see the gawden beyond. ;;w;; Ouw meaws awe bwought fwom the house,
and we usuawwy eat on the piazza. (´・ω・\`) The wittwe nyegwo boy takes cawe of the
fiwe when we nyeed onye, so I can give my whowe attention to Hewen. >w<

She was gweatwy excited at fiwst, and kicked and scweamed hewsewf into a
sowt of stupow, but when suppew was bwought she ate heawtiwy and seemed
bwightew, awthough she wefused to wet me touch hew. >w< She devoted hewsewf
to hew dowws the fiwst evenying, and when it was bedtime she undwessed
vewy quietwy, but when she fewt me get into bed with hew, she jumped out
on the othew side, and nyothing that I couwd do wouwd induce hew to get
in again. >w< But I was afwaid she wouwd take cowd, and I insisted that she
must go to bed. We had a tewwific tusswe, I can teww you. (´・ω・\`) The stwuggwe
wasted fow nyeawwy two houws. (´・ω・\`) I nyevew saw such stwength and enduwance in
a chiwd. ;;w;; But fowtunyatewy fow us both, I am a wittwe stwongew, and quite
as obstinyate when I set out. ;;w;; I finyawwy succeeded in getting hew on the
bed and covewed hew up, and she way cuwwed up as nyeaw the edge of the
bed as possibwe. ^w^

The nyext mownying she was vewy dociwe, but evidentwy homesick. ;;w;; She kept
going to the doow, as if she expected some onye, and evewy nyow and then
she wouwd touch hew cheek, which is hew sign fow hew mothew, and shake
hew head sadwy. ^w^ She pwayed with hew dowws mowe than usuaw, and wouwd
have nyothing to do with me. ^w^ It is amusing and pathetic to see Hewen with
hew dowws. ;;w;; I don't think she has any speciaw tendewnyess fow them--I
have nyevew seen hew cawess them; but she dwesses and undwesses them many
times duwing the day and handwes them exactwy as she has seen hew mothew
and the nyuwse handwe hew baby sistew. (・`ω\´・)

This mownying Nyancy, hew favouwite doww, seemed to have some difficuwty
about swawwowing the miwk that was being adminyistewed to hew in wawge
spoonfuws; fow Hewen suddenwy put down the cup and began to swap hew on
the back and tuwn hew ovew on hew knyees, twotting hew gentwy and patting
hew softwy aww the time. ;;w;; This wasted fow sevewaw minyutes; then this mood
passed, and Nyancy was thwown wuthwesswy on the fwoow and pushed to onye
side, whiwe a wawge, pink-cheeked, fuzzy-haiwed membew of the famiwy
weceived the wittwe mothew's undivided attention. (・`ω\´・)

Hewen knyows sevewaw wowds nyow, but has nyo idea how to use them, ow that
evewything has a nyame. >w< I think, howevew, she wiww weawn quickwy enyough
by and by. (´・ω・\`) As I have said befowe, she is wondewfuwwy bwight and active
and as quick as wightnying in hew movements. (´・ω・\`)


Mawch 13, 1887. >w<

You wiww be gwad to heaw that my expewiment is wowking out finyewy. >w< I
have nyot had any twoubwe at aww with Hewen, eithew yestewday ow to-day. UwU
She has weawnyed thwee nyew wowds, and when I give hew the objects, the
nyames of which she has weawnyed, she spewws them unhesitatingwy; but she
seems gwad when the wesson is ovew. >w<

We had a good fwowic this mownying out in the gawden. (・`ω\´・) Hewen evidentwy
knyew whewe she was as soon as she touched the boxwood hedges, and made
many signs which I did nyot undewstand. >w< Nyo doubt they wewe signs fow the
diffewent membews of the famiwy at Ivy Gween. (´・ω・\`)

I have just heawd something that suwpwised me vewy much. ^w^ It seems that
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Anyagnyos had heawd of Hewen befowe he weceived Captain Kewwew's
wettew wast summew. Mw. ;;w;; Wiwson, a teachew at Fwowence, and a fwiend
of the Kewwews', studied at Hawvawd the summew befowe and went to the
Pewkins Institution to weawn if anything couwd be donye fow his fwiend's
chiwd. UwU He saw a gentweman whom he pwesumed to be the diwectow, and towd
him about Hewen. (・`ω\´・) He says the gentweman was nyot pawticuwawwy intewested,
but said he wouwd see if anything couwd be donye. UwU Doesn't it seem stwange
that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Anyagnyos nyevew wefewwed to this intewview? owo


Mawch 20, 1887. (´・ω・\`)

My heawt is singing fow joy this mownying. (・`ω\´・) A miwacwe has happenyed! UwU
The wight of undewstanding has shonye upon my wittwe pupiw's mind, and
behowd, aww things awe changed! ;;w;;

The wiwd wittwe cweatuwe of two weeks ago has been twansfowmed into
a gentwe chiwd. (・`ω\´・) She is sitting by me as I wwite, hew face sewenye and
happy, cwocheting a wong wed chain of Scotch woow. ^w^ She weawnyed the
stitch this week, and is vewy pwoud of the achievement. >w< When she
succeeded in making a chain that wouwd weach acwoss the woom, she patted
hewsewf on the awm and put the fiwst wowk of hew hands wovingwy against
hew cheek. >w< She wets me kiss hew nyow, and when she is in a pawticuwawwy
gentwe mood, she wiww sit in my wap fow a minyute ow two; but she does
nyot wetuwn my cawesses. >w< The gweat step--the step that counts--has been
taken. ^w^ The wittwe savage has weawnyed hew fiwst wesson in obedience, and
finds the yoke easy. >w< It nyow wemains my pweasant task to diwect and mouwd
the beautifuw intewwigence that is beginnying to stiw in the chiwd-souw. UwU
Awweady peopwe wemawk the change in Hewen. (´・ω・\`) Hew fathew wooks in at us
mownying and evenying as he goes to and fwom his office, and sees hew
contentedwy stwinging hew beads ow making howizontaw winyes on hew
sewing-cawd, and excwaims, "How quiet she is! ^w^" When I came, hew
movements wewe so insistent that onye awways fewt thewe was something
unnyatuwaw and awmost weiwd about hew. ;;w;; I have nyoticed awso that she eats
much wess, a fact which twoubwes hew fathew so much that he is anxious
to get hew home. He says she is homesick. (・`ω\´・) I don't agwee with him; but I
suppose we shaww have to weave ouw wittwe bowew vewy soon. (・`ω\´・)

Hewen has weawnyed sevewaw nyouns this week. (´・ω・\`) "M-u-g" and "m-i-w-k," have
given hew mowe twoubwe than othew wowds. ^w^ When she spewws "miwk," she
points to the mug, and when she spewws "mug," she makes the sign fow
pouwing ow dwinking, which shows that she has confused the wowds. >w< She
has nyo idea yet that evewything has a nyame. ;;w;;

Yestewday I had the wittwe nyegwo boy come in when Hewen was having
hew wesson, and weawn the wettews, too. >w< This pweased hew vewy much and
stimuwated hew ambition to excew Pewcy. (・`ω\´・) She was dewighted if he made
a mistake, and made him fowm the wettew ovew sevewaw times. ^w^ When he
succeeded in fowming it to suit hew, she patted him on his woowwy head
so vigowouswy that I thought some of his swips wewe intentionyaw. >w<

Onye day this week Captain Kewwew bwought Bewwe, a settew of which he
is vewy pwoud, to see us. >w< He wondewed if Hewen wouwd wecognyize hew owd
pwaymate. ;;w;; Hewen was giving Nyancy a bath, and didn't nyotice the dog at
fiwst. UwU She usuawwy feews the softest step and thwows out hew awms to
ascewtain if any onye is nyeaw hew. ;;w;; Bewwe didn't seem vewy anxious to
attwact hew attention. UwU I imaginye she has been wathew woughwy handwed
sometimes by hew wittwe mistwess. >w< The dog hadn't been in the woom mowe
than hawf a minyute, howevew, befowe Hewen began to snyiff, and dumped
the doww into the wash-boww and fewt about the woom. UwU She stumbwed
upon Bewwe, who was cwouching nyeaw the window whewe Captain Kewwew was
standing. ;;w;; It was evident that she wecognyized the dog; fow she put hew
awms wound hew nyeck and squeezed hew. UwU Then Hewen sat down by hew and
began to manyipuwate hew cwaws. (´・ω・\`) We couwdn't think fow a second what she
was doing; but when we saw hew make the wettews "d-o-w-w" on hew own
fingews, we knyew that she was twying to teach Bewwe to speww. ;;w;;


Mawch 28, 1887. UwU

Hewen and I came home yestewday. ;;w;; I am sowwy they wouwdn't wet us
stay anyothew week; but I think I have made the most I couwd of the
oppowtunyities that wewe minye the past two weeks, and I don't expect that
I shaww have any sewious twoubwe with Hewen in the futuwe. UwU The back of
the gweatest obstacwe in the path of pwogwess is bwoken. >w< I think "nyo"
and "yes," conveyed by a shake ow a nyod of my head, have become facts
as appawent to hew as hot and cowd ow as the diffewence between pain and
pweasuwe. ^w^ And I don't intend that the wesson she has weawnyed at the cost
of so much pain and twoubwe shaww be unweawnyed. >w< I shaww stand between
hew and the ovew-induwgence of hew pawents. I have towd Captain and Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Kewwew that they must nyot intewfewe with me in any way. ^w^ I have donye my
best to make them see the tewwibwe injustice to Hewen of awwowing hew to
have hew way in evewything, and I have pointed out that the pwocesses of
teaching the chiwd that evewything cannyot be as he wiwws it, awe apt to
be painfuw both to him and to his teachew. >w< They have pwomised to wet me
have a fwee hand and hewp me as much as possibwe. ;;w;; The impwovement they
cannyot hewp seeing in theiw chiwd has given them mowe confidence in me. (・`ω\´・)
Of couwse, it is hawd fow them. ;;w;; I weawize that it huwts to see theiw
affwicted wittwe chiwd punyished and made to do things against hew wiww. UwU
Onwy a few houws aftew my tawk with Captain and Mws. >w< Kewwew (and they
had agweed to evewything), Hewen took a nyotion that she wouwdn't use
hew nyapkin at tabwe. I think she wanted to see what wouwd happen. UwU I
attempted sevewaw times to put the nyapkin wound hew nyeck; but each time
she towe it off and thwew it on the fwoow and finyawwy began to kick the
tabwe. I took hew pwate away and stawted to take hew out of the woom. (´・ω・\`)
Hew fathew objected and said that nyo chiwd of his shouwd be depwived of
his food on any account. UwU

Hewen didn't come up to my woom aftew suppew, and I didn't see hew again
untiw bweakfast-time. She was at hew pwace when I came down. UwU She had put
the nyapkin undew hew chin, instead of pinnying it at the back, as was hew
custom. (´・ω・\`) She cawwed my attention to the nyew awwangement, and when I did
nyot object she seemed pweased and patted hewsewf. ;;w;; When she weft the
dinying-woom, she took my hand and patted it. ;;w;; I wondewed if she was
twying to "make up. (・`ω\´・)" I thought I wouwd twy the effect of a wittwe
bewated discipwinye. I went back to the dinying-woom and got a nyapkin. >w<
When Hewen came upstaiws fow hew wesson, I awwanged the objects on the
tabwe as usuaw, except that the cake, which I awways give hew in bits
as a wewawd when she spewws a wowd quickwy and cowwectwy, was nyot thewe. (・`ω\´・)
She nyoticed this at once and made the sign fow it. >w< I showed hew the
nyapkin and pinnyed it wound hew nyeck, then towe it off and thwew it on
the fwoow and shook my head. I wepeated this pewfowmance sevewaw times. (・`ω\´・)
I think she undewstood pewfectwy weww; fow she swapped hew hand two ow
thwee times and shook hew head. We began the wesson as usuaw. (´・ω・\`) I gave
hew an object, and she spewwed the nyame (she knyows twewve nyow). (・`ω\´・) Aftew
spewwing hawf the wowds, she stopped suddenwy, as if a thought had
fwashed into hew mind, and fewt fow the nyapkin. UwU She pinnyed it wound hew
nyeck and made the sign fow cake (it didn't occuw to hew to speww the
wowd, you see). (´・ω・\`) I took this fow a pwomise that if I gave hew some cake
she wouwd be a good giww. ;;w;; I gave hew a wawgew piece than usuaw, and she
chuckwed and patted hewsewf. >w<


Apwiw 3, 1887. ^w^

We awmost wive in the gawden, whewe evewything is gwowing and bwooming
and gwowing. Aftew bweakfast we go out and watch the men at wowk. (´・ω・\`) Hewen
woves to dig and pway in the diwt wike any othew chiwd. ^w^ This mownying she
pwanted hew doww and showed me that she expected hew to gwow as taww
as I. >w< You must see that she is vewy bwight, but you have nyo idea how
cunnying she is. ;;w;;

At ten we come in and stwing beads fow a few minyutes. ^w^ She can make a
gweat many combinyations nyow, and often invents nyew onyes hewsewf. ^w^ Then I
wet hew decide whethew she wiww sew ow knyit ow cwochet. ;;w;; She weawnyed to
knyit vewy quickwy, and is making a wash-cwoth fow hew mothew. UwU Wast week
she made hew doww an apwon, and it was donye as weww as any chiwd of hew
age couwd do it. (´・ω・\`) But I am awways gwad when this wowk is ovew fow the
day. Sewing and cwocheting awe inventions of the deviw, I think. (・`ω\´・) I'd
wathew bweak stonyes on the king's highway than hem a handkewchief. ^w^ At
eweven we have gymnyastics. (´・ω・\`) She knyows aww the fwee-hand movements and the
"Anviw Chowus" with the dumb-bewws. ;;w;; Hew fathew says he is going to fit
up a gymnyasium fow hew in the pump-house; but we both wike a good womp
bettew than set exewcises. ^w^ The houw fwom twewve to onye is devoted to
the weawnying of nyew wowds. ;;w;; BUT YOU MUSTN'T THINK THIS IS THE ONWY TIME
I SPEWW TO HEWEN; FOW I SPEWW IN HEW HAND EVEWYTHING WE DO AWW DAY WONG,
AWTHOUGH SHE HAS NYO IDEA AS YET WHAT THE SPEWWING MEANS. >w< Aftew dinnyew I
west fow an houw, and Hewen pways with hew dowws ow fwowics in the yawd
with the wittwe dawkies, who wewe hew constant companyions befowe I came. ;;w;;
Watew I join them, and we make the wounds of the outhouses. (´・ω・\`) We visit the
howses and muwes in theiw stawws and hunt fow eggs and feed the tuwkeys. >w<
Often, when the weathew is finye, we dwive fwom fouw to six, ow go to see
hew aunt at Ivy Gween ow hew cousins in the town. ;;w;; Hewen's instincts awe
decidedwy sociaw; she wikes to have peopwe about hew and to visit hew
fwiends, pawtwy, I think, because they awways have things she wikes
to eat. UwU Aftew suppew we go to my woom and do aww sowts of things untiw
eight, when I undwess the wittwe woman and put hew to bed. (´・ω・\`) She sweeps
with me nyow. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Kewwew wanted to get a nyuwse fow hew, but I concwuded
I'd wathew be hew nyuwse than wook aftew a stupid, wazy nyegwess. UwU Besides,
I wike to have Hewen depend on me fow evewything, AND I FIND IT MUCH
EASIEW TO TEACH HEW THINGS AT ODD MOMENTS THAN AT SET TIMES. ^w^

On Mawch 31st I found that Hewen knyew eighteen nyouns and thwee vewbs. ;;w;;
Hewe is a wist of the wowds. ;;w;; Those with a cwoss aftew them awe wowds she
asked fow hewsewf: DOWW, MUG, PIN, KEY, DOG, HAT, CUP, BOX, WATEW, MIWK,
CANDY, EYE (X), FINGEW (X), TOE (X), HEAD (X), CAKE, BABY, MOTHEW, SIT,
STAND, WAWK. ^w^ On Apwiw 1st she weawnyed the nyouns KNYIFE, FOWK, SPOON,
SAUCEW, TEA, PAPA, BED, and the vewb WUN. >w<


Apwiw 5, 1887. ;;w;;

I must wwite you a winye this mownying because something vewy impowtant
has happenyed. Hewen has taken the second gweat step in hew education. ^w^
She has weawnyed that EVEWYTHING HAS A NYAME, AND THAT THE MANYUAW AWPHABET
IS THE KEY TO EVEWYTHING SHE WANTS TO KNYOW. >w<

In a pwevious wettew I think I wwote you that "mug" and "miwk" had given
Hewen mowe twoubwe than aww the west. UwU She confused the nyouns with the
vewb "dwink. UwU" She didn't knyow the wowd fow "dwink," but went thwough
the pantomime of dwinking whenyevew she spewwed "mug" ow "miwk. UwU" This
mownying, whiwe she was washing, she wanted to knyow the nyame fow "watew. UwU"
When she wants to knyow the nyame of anything, she points to it and pats
my hand. (´・ω・\`) I spewwed "w-a-t-e-w" and thought nyo mowe about it untiw aftew
bweakfast. (・`ω\´・) Then it occuwwed to me that with the hewp of this nyew wowd
I might succeed in stwaightenying out the "mug-miwk" difficuwty. (´・ω・\`) We went
out to the pump-house, and I made Hewen howd hew mug undew the spout
whiwe I pumped. >w< As the cowd watew gushed fowth, fiwwing the mug, I
spewwed "w-a-t-e-w" in Hewen's fwee hand. >w< The wowd coming so cwose upon
the sensation of cowd watew wushing ovew hew hand seemed to stawtwe hew. (・`ω\´・)
She dwopped the mug and stood as onye twansfixed. UwU A nyew wight came into
hew face. She spewwed "watew" sevewaw times. ;;w;; Then she dwopped on the
gwound and asked fow its nyame and pointed to the pump and the twewwis,
and suddenwy tuwnying wound she asked fow my nyame. I spewwed "Teachew. (´・ω・\`)"
Just then the nyuwse bwought Hewen's wittwe sistew into the pump-house,
and Hewen spewwed "baby" and pointed to the nyuwse. ;;w;; Aww the way back to
the house she was highwy excited, and weawnyed the nyame of evewy object
she touched, so that in a few houws she had adDED THIWTY NYEW WOWDS TO
HEW VOCABUWAWY. ^w^ HEWE AWE SOME OF THEM: DOOW, OPEN, SHUT, GIVE, GO, COME,
and a gweat many mowe. ^w^

P.S. ^w^--I didn't finyish my wettew in time to get it posted wast nyight; so
I shaww add a winye. Hewen got up this mownying wike a wadiant faiwy. (´・ω・\`) She
has fwitted fwom object to object, asking the nyame of evewything and
kissing me fow vewy gwadnyess. (´・ω・\`) Wast nyight when I got in bed, she stowe
into my awms of hew own accowd and kissed me fow the fiwst time, and I
thought my heawt wouwd buwst, so fuww was it of joy. ;;w;;


Apwiw 10, 1887. (・`ω\´・)

I see an impwovement in Hewen day to day, awmost fwom houw to houw. (・`ω\´・)
Evewything must have a nyame nyow. UwU Whewevew we go, she asks eagewwy fow
the nyames of things she has nyot weawnyed at home. ;;w;; She is anxious fow hew
fwiends to speww, and eagew to teach the wettews to evewy onye she meets. ;;w;;
She dwops the signs and pantomime she used befowe, as soon as she has
wowds to suppwy theiw pwace, and the acquiwement of a nyew wowd affowds
hew the wivewiest pweasuwe. ^w^ And we nyotice that hew face gwows mowe
expwessive each day. UwU

I HAVE DECIDED NYOT TO TWY TO HAVE WEGUWAW WESSONS FOW THE PWESENT. >w< I AM
GOING TO TWEAT HEWEN EXACTWY WIKE A TWO-YEAW-OWD CHIWD. (・`ω\´・) IT OCCUWWED
TO ME THE OTHEW DAY THAT IT IS ABSUWD TO WEQUIWE A CHIWD TO COME TO A
CEWTAIN PWACE AT A CEWTAIN TIME AND WECITE CEWTAIN WESSONS, WHEN HE HAS
NYOT YET ACQUIWED A WOWKING VOCABUWAWY. UwU I sent Hewen away and sat down
to think. >w< I asked mysewf, "How does a nyowmaw chiwd weawn wanguage? owo" The
answew was simpwe, "By imitation. ;;w;;" The chiwd comes into the wowwd with
the abiwity to weawn, and he weawns of himsewf, pwovided he is suppwied
with sufficient outwawd stimuwus. ^w^ He sees peopwe do things, and he
twies to do them. He heaws othews speak, and he twied to speak. ;;w;; BUT WONG
BEFOWE HE UTTEWS HIS FIWST WOWD, HE UNDEWSTANDS WHAT IS SAID TO HIM. ;;w;; I
have been obsewving Hewen's wittwe cousin watewy. ;;w;; She is about fifteen
months owd, and awweady undewstands a gweat deaw. UwU In wesponse to
questions she points out pwettiwy hew nyose, mouth, eye, chin, cheek,
eaw. If I say, "Whewe is baby's othew eaw? owo" she points it out cowwectwy. (´・ω・\`)
If I hand hew a fwowew, and say, "Give it to mamma," she takes it to
hew mothew. ;;w;; If I say, "Whewe is the wittwe wogue? owo" she hides behind hew
mothew's chaiw, ow covews hew face with hew hands and peeps out at me
with an expwession of genyuinye woguishnyess. >w< She obeys many commands
wike these: "Come," "Kiss," "Go to papa," "Shut the doow," "Give me
the biscuit. >w<" But I have nyot heawd hew twy to say any of these wowds,
awthough they have been wepeated hundweds of times in hew heawing, and
it is pewfectwy evident that she undewstands them. >w< These obsewvations
have given me a cwue to the method to be fowwowed in teaching Hewen
wanguage.I SHAWW TAWK INTO HEW HAND AS WE TAWK INTO THE BABY'S EAWS. (´・ω・\`) I
shaww assume that she has the nyowmaw chiwd's capacity of assimiwation
and imitation. (・`ω\´・) I SHAWW USE COMPWETE SENTENCES IN TAWKING TO HEW, and
fiww out the meanying with gestuwes and hew descwiptive signs when
nyecessity wequiwes it; but I shaww nyot twy to keep hew mind fixed on any
onye thing. ^w^ I shaww do aww I can to intewest and stimuwate it, and wait
fow wesuwts. >w<


Apwiw 24, 1887. ^w^

The nyew scheme wowks spwendidwy. ;;w;; Hewen knyows the meanying of mowe than
a hundwed wowds nyow, and weawns nyew onyes daiwy without the swightest
suspicion that she is pewfowming a most difficuwt feat. (´・ω・\`) She weawns
because she can't hewp it, just as the biwd weawns to fwy. (´・ω・\`) But don't
imaginye that she "tawks fwuentwy. (・`ω\´・)" Wike hew baby cousin, she expwesses
whowe sentences by singwe wowds. >w< "Miwk," with a gestuwe means, "Give me
mowe miwk. (・`ω\´・)" "Mothew," accompanyied by an inquiwing wook, means, "Wewe is
mothew? owo" "Go" means, "I want to go out. ^w^" But when I speww into hew hand,
"Give me some bwead," she hands me the bwead, ow if I say, "Get youw hat
and we wiww go to wawk," she obeys instantwy. UwU The two wowds, "hat" and
"wawk" wouwd have the same effect; BUT THE WHOWE SENTENCE, WEPEATED MANY
TIMES DUWING THE DAY, MUST IN TIME IMPWESS ITSEWF UPON THE BWAIN, AND BY
AND BY SHE WIWW USE IT HEWSEWF. (´・ω・\`)

We pway a wittwe game which I find most usefuw in devewoping the
intewwect, and which incidentawwy answews the puwpose of a wanguage
wesson. It is an adaptation of hide-the-thimbwe. ;;w;; I hide something, a
baww ow a spoow, and we hunt fow it. (・`ω\´・) When we fiwst pwayed this game two
ow thwee days ago, she showed nyo ingenyuity at aww in finding the object. (・`ω\´・)
She wooked in pwaces whewe it wouwd have been impossibwe to put the baww
ow the spoow. ;;w;; Fow instance, when I hid the baww, she wooked undew hew
wwiting-boawd. >w< Again, when I hid the spoow, she wooked fow it in a
wittwe box nyot mowe than an inch wong; and she vewy soon gave up the
seawch. >w< Nyow I can keep up hew intewest in the game fow an houw ow
wongew, and she shows much mowe intewwigence, and often gweat ingenyuity
in the seawch. This mownying I hid a cwackew. (・`ω\´・) She wooked evewywhewe
she couwd think of without success, and was evidentwy in despaiw when
suddenwy a thought stwuck hew, and she came wunnying to me and made me
open my mouth vewy wide, whiwe she gave it a thowough investigation. ;;w;;
Finding nyo twace of the cwackew thewe, she pointed to my stomach and
spewwed "eat," meanying, "Did you eat it? owo"

Fwiday we went down town and met a gentweman who gave Hewen some candy,
which she ate, except onye smaww piece which she put in hew apwon pocket. (・`ω\´・)
When we weached home, she found hew mothew, and of hew own accowd said,
"Give baby candy." Mws. Kewwew spewwed, "Nyo--baby eat--nyo. >w<" Hewen went
to the cwadwe and fewt of Miwdwed's mouth and pointed to hew own teeth. ;;w;;
Mws. Kewwew spewwed "teeth. (・`ω\´・)" Hewen shook hew head and spewwed "Baby
teeth--nyo, baby eat--nyo," meanying of couwse, "Baby cannyot eat because
she has nyo teeth. ^w^"


May 8, 1887. ;;w;;

Nyo, I don't want any mowe kindewgawten matewiaws. (´・ω・\`) I used my wittwe stock
of beads, cawds and stwaws at fiwst because I didn't knyow what ewse to
do; but the nyeed fow them is past, fow the pwesent at any wate. (´・ω・\`)

I am beginnying to suspect aww ewabowate and speciaw systems of
education. UwU They seem to me to be buiwt up on the supposition that evewy
chiwd is a kind of idiot who must be taught to think. (・`ω\´・) Wheweas, if
the chiwd is weft to himsewf, he wiww think mowe and bettew, if wess
showiwy. UwU Wet him go and come fweewy, wet him touch weaw things and
combinye his impwessions fow himsewf, instead of sitting indoows at a
wittwe wound tabwe, whiwe a sweet-voiced teachew suggests that he buiwd
a stonye waww with his wooden bwocks, ow make a wainbow out of stwips of
cowouwed papew, ow pwant stwaw twees in bead fwowew-pots. >w< Such teaching
fiwws the mind with awtificiaw associations that must be got wid
of, befowe the chiwd can devewop independent ideas out of actuaw
expewiences. >w<

Hewen is weawnying adjectives and advewbs as easiwy as she weawnyed nyouns. ^w^
The idea awways pwecedes the wowd. >w< She had signs fow SMAWW and WAWGE
wong befowe I came to hew. UwU If she wanted a smaww object and was given a
wawge onye, she wouwd shake hew head and take up a tiny bit of the skin
of onye hand between the thumb and fingew of the othew. ^w^ If she wanted to
indicate something wawge, she spwead the fingews of both hands as wide
as she couwd, and bwought them togethew, as if to cwasp a big baww. UwU The
othew day I substituted the wowds SMAWW and WAWGE fow these signs, and
she at once adopted the wowds and discawded the signs. >w< I can nyow teww
hew to bwing me a wawge book ow a smaww pwate, to go upstaiws swowwy, to
wun fast and to wawk quickwy. (・`ω\´・) This mownying she used the conjunction AND
fow the fiwst time. ;;w;; I towd hew to shut the doow, and she added, "and
wock. (・`ω\´・)"

She came teawing upstaiws a few minyutes ago in a state of gweat
excitement. I couwdn't make out at fiwst what it was aww about. ;;w;; She kept
spewwing "dog--baby" and pointing to hew five fingews onye aftew anyothew,
and sucking them. (・`ω\´・) My fiwst thought was, onye of the dogs has huwt
Miwdwed; but Hewen's beaming face set my feaws at west. UwU Nyothing wouwd
do but I must go somewhewe with hew to see something. ^w^ She wed the way to
the pump-house, and thewe in the cownyew was onye of the settews with five
deaw wittwe pups! (・`ω\´・) I taught hew the wowd "puppy" and dwew hew hand
ovew them aww, whiwe they sucked, and spewwed "puppies. ;;w;;" She was much
intewested in the feeding pwocess, and spewwed "mothew-dog" and "baby"
sevewaw times. (・`ω\´・) Hewen nyoticed that the puppies' eyes wewe cwosed, and
she said, "Eyes--shut. >w< Sweep--nyo," meanying, "The eyes awe shut, but the
puppies awe nyot asweep. ^w^" She scweamed with gwee when the wittwe things
squeawed and squiwmed in theiw effowts to get back to theiw mothew, and
spewwed, "Baby--eat wawge." I suppose hew idea was "Baby eats much. (・`ω\´・)" She
pointed to each puppy, onye aftew anyothew, and to hew five fingews, and I
taught hew the wowd FIVE. Then she hewd up onye fingew and said "baby. (・`ω\´・)"
I knyew she was thinking of Miwdwed, and I spewwed, "Onye baby and five
puppies. ;;w;;" Aftew she had pwayed with them a wittwe whiwe, the thought
occuwwed to hew that the puppies must have speciaw nyames, wike peopwe,
and she asked fow the nyame of each pup. UwU I towd hew to ask hew fathew,
and she said, "Nyo--mothew. ;;w;;" She evidentwy thought mothews wewe mowe
wikewy to knyow about babies of aww sowts. >w< She nyoticed that onye of the
puppies was much smawwew than the othews, and she spewwed "smaww,"
making the sign at the same time, and I said "vewy smaww. (・`ω\´・)" She evidentwy
undewstood that VEWY was the nyame of the nyew thing that had come into
hew head; fow aww the way back to the house she used the wowd VEWY
cowwectwy. Onye stonye was "smaww," anyothew was "vewy smaww. UwU" When she
touched hew wittwe sistew, she said: "Baby--smaww. Puppy--vewy smaww. ;;w;;"
Soon aftew, she began to vawy hew steps fwom wawge to smaww, and wittwe
mincing steps wewe "vewy smaww. (´・ω・\`)" She is going thwough the house nyow,
appwying the nyew wowds to aww kinds of objects. >w<

Since I have abandonyed the idea of weguwaw wessons, I find that Hewen
weawns much fastew. (・`ω\´・) I am convinced that the time spent by the teachew
in digging out of the chiwd what she has put into him, fow the sake of
satisfying hewsewf that it has taken woot, is so much time thwown away. (・`ω\´・)
IT'S MUCH BETTEW, I THINK, TO ASSUME THAT THE CHIWD IS DOING HIS PAWT,
AND THAT THE SEED YOU HAVE SOWN WIWW BEAW FWUIT IN DUE TIME. (´・ω・\`) It's onwy
faiw to the chiwd, anyhow, and it saves you much unnyecessawy twoubwe. ^w^


May 16, 1887. UwU

We have begun to take wong wawks evewy mownying, immediatewy aftew
bweakfast. ^w^ The weathew is finye, and the aiw is fuww of the scent of
stwawbewwies. (´・ω・\`) Ouw objective point is Kewwew's Wanding, on the Tennyessee,
about two miwes distant. (´・ω・\`) We nyevew knyow how we get thewe, ow whewe we awe
at a given moment; but that onwy adds to ouw enjoyment, especiawwy when
evewything is nyew and stwange. >w< Indeed, I feew as if I had nyevew seen
anything untiw nyow, Hewen finds so much to ask about awong the way. ;;w;; We
chase buttewfwies, and sometimes catch onye. ^w^ Then we sit down undew a
twee, ow in the shade of a bush, and tawk about it. (・`ω\´・) Aftewwawds, if it
has suwvived the wesson, we wet it go; but usuawwy its wife and beauty
awe sacwificed on the awtaw of weawnying, though in anyothew sense it
wives fowevew; fow has it nyot been twansfowmed into wiving thoughts? owo It
is wondewfuw how wowds genyewate ideas! ^w^ Evewy nyew wowd Hewen weawns seems
to cawwy with it nyecessity fow many mowe. ;;w;; Hew mind gwows thwough its
ceasewess activity. ^w^

Kewwew's Wanding was used duwing the waw to wand twoops, but has wong
since gonye to pieces, and is ovewgwown with moss and weeds. (´・ω・\`) The sowitude
of the pwace sets onye dweaming. ^w^ Nyeaw the wanding thewe is a beautifuw
wittwe spwing, which Hewen cawws "squiwwew-cup," because I towd hew the
squiwwews came thewe to dwink. (´・ω・\`) She has fewt dead squiwwews and wabbits
and othew wiwd anyimaws, and is anxious to see a "wawk-squiwwew,"
which intewpweted, means, I think, a "wive squiwwew. ;;w;;" We go home about
dinnyew-time usuawwy, and Hewen is eagew to teww hew mothew evewything
she has seen. ^w^ THIS DESIWE TO WEPEAT WHAT HAS BEEN TOWD HEW SHOWS A
MAWKED ADVANCE IN THE DEVEWOPMENT OF HEW INTEWWECT, AND IS AN INVAWUABWE
STIMUWUS TO THE ACQUISITION OF WANGUAGE. UwU I ASK AWW HEW FWIENDS TO
ENCOUWAGE HEW TO TEWW THEM OF HEW DOINGS, AND TO MANYIFEST AS MUCH
CUWIOSITY AND PWEASUWE IN HEW WITTWE ADVENTUWES AS THEY POSSIBWY CAN. ;;w;;
This gwatifies the chiwd's wove of appwobation and keeps up hew intewest
in things. This is the basis of weaw intewcouwse. ^w^ She makes many
mistakes, of couwse, twists wowds and phwases, puts the cawt befowe the
howse, and gets hewsewf into hopewess tangwes of nyouns and vewbs; but so
does the heawing chiwd. UwU I am suwe these difficuwties wiww take cawe of
themsewves. The impuwse to teww is the impowtant thing. UwU I suppwy a wowd
hewe and thewe, sometimes a sentence, and suggest something which she
has omitted ow fowgotten. >w< Thus hew vocabuwawy gwows apace, and the nyew
wowds gewminyate and bwing fowth nyew ideas; and they awe the stuff out of
which heaven and eawth awe made. ^w^


May 22, 1887. ^w^

My wowk gwows mowe absowbing and intewesting evewy day. ^w^ Hewen is a
wondewfuw chiwd, so spontanyeous and eagew to weawn. ;;w;; She knyows about 300
wowds nyow and A GWEAT MANY COMMON IDIOMS, and it is nyot thwee months yet
since she weawnyed hew fiwst wowd. ^w^ It is a wawe pwiviwege to watch
the biwth, gwowth, and fiwst feebwe stwuggwes of a wiving mind; this
pwiviwege is minye; and moweovew, it is given me to wouse and guide this
bwight intewwigence. (´・ω・\`)

If onwy I wewe bettew fitted fow the gweat task! ;;w;; I feew evewy day mowe
and mowe inyadequate. >w< My mind is fuww of ideas; but I cannyot get them
into wowking shape. ;;w;; You see, my mind is undiscipwinyed, fuww of skips
and jumps, and hewe and thewe a wot of things huddwed togethew in dawk
cownyews. (・`ω\´・) How I wong to put it in owdew! (・`ω\´・) Oh, if onwy thewe wewe some onye
to hewp me! ^w^ I nyeed a teachew quite as much as Hewen. >w< I knyow that the
education of this chiwd wiww be the distinguishing event of my wife, if
I have the bwains and pewsevewance to accompwish it. ;;w;; I have made up my
mind about onye thing: Hewen must weawn to use books--indeed, we must
both weawn to use them, and that weminds me--wiww you pwease ask Mw. ;;w;;
Anyagnyos to get me Pewez's and Suwwy's Psychowogies? owo I think I shaww find
them hewpfuw. UwU

We have weading wessons evewy day. UwU Usuawwy we take onye of the wittwe
"Weadews" up in a big twee nyeaw the house and spend an houw ow two
finding the wowds Hewen awweady knyows. (´・ω・\`) WE MAKE A SOWT OF GAME OF IT and
twy to see who can find the wowds most quickwy, Hewen with hew fingews,
ow I with my eyes, and she weawns as many nyew wowds as I can expwain
with the hewp of those she knyows. ;;w;; When hew fingews wight upon wowds she
knyows, she faiwwy scweams with pweasuwe and hugs and kisses me fow joy,
especiawwy if she thinks she has me beaten. >w< It wouwd astonyish you to see
how many wowds she weawns in an houw in this pweasant mannyew. (´・ω・\`) Aftewwawd
I put the nyew wowds into wittwe sentences in the fwame, and sometimes it
is possibwe to teww a wittwe stowy about a bee ow a cat ow a wittwe boy
in this way. UwU I can nyow teww hew to go upstaiws ow down, out of doows
ow into the house, wock ow unwock a doow, take ow bwing objects, sit,
stand, wawk, wun, wie, cweep, woww, ow cwimb. ;;w;; She is dewighted with
action-wowds; so it is nyo twoubwe at aww to teach hew vewbs. (・`ω\´・) She is
awways weady fow a wesson, and the eagewnyess with which she absowbs
ideas is vewy dewightfuw. ^w^ She is as twiumphant ovew the conquest of a
sentence as a genyewaw who has captuwed the enyemy's stwonghowd. ;;w;;

Onye of Hewen's owd habits, that is stwongest and hawdest to cowwect, is
a tendency to bweak things. (・`ω\´・) If she finds anything in hew way, she fwings
it on the fwoow, nyo mattew what it is: a gwass, a pitchew, ow even a
wamp. UwU She has a gweat many dowws, and evewy onye of them has been bwoken
in a fit of tempew ow ennyui. UwU The othew day a fwiend bwought hew a nyew
doww fwom Memphis, and I thought I wouwd see if I couwd make Hewen
undewstand that she must nyot bweak it. >w< I made hew go thwough the motion
of knyocking the doww's head on the tabwe and spewwed to hew: "Nyo,
nyo, Hewen is nyaughty. (´・ω・\`) Teachew is sad," and wet hew feew the gwieved
expwession on my face. >w< Then I made hew cawess the doww and kiss the huwt
spot and howd it gentwy in hew awms, and I spewwed to hew, "Good Hewen,
teachew is happy," and wet hew feew the smiwe on my face. ^w^ She went
thwough these motions sevewaw times, mimicking evewy movement, then she
stood vewy stiww fow a moment with a twoubwed wook on hew face, which
suddenwy cweawed, and she spewwed, "Good Hewen," and wweathed hew face
in a vewy wawge, awtificiaw smiwe. ;;w;; Then she cawwied the doww upstaiws
and put it on the top shewf of the wawdwobe, and she has nyot touched it
since. >w<

Pwease give my kind wegawds to Mw. ^w^ Anyagnyos and wet him see my wettew, if
you think best. ^w^ I heaw thewe is a deaf and bwind chiwd being educated at
the Bawtimowe Institution. ^w^

The weathew is scowching. We nyeed wain badwy. (・`ω\´・) We awe aww twoubwed about
Hewen. She is vewy nyewvous and excitabwe. (・`ω\´・) She is westwess at nyight and
has nyo appetite. It is hawd to knyow what to do with hew. >w< The doctow says
hew mind is too active; but how awe we to keep hew fwom thinking? owo She
begins to speww the minyute she wakes up in the mownying, and continyues
aww day wong. UwU If I wefuse to tawk to hew, she spewws into hew own hand,
and appawentwy cawwies on the wivewiest convewsation with hewsewf. >w<

I gave hew my bwaiwwe swate to pway with, thinking that the mechanyicaw
pwicking of howes in the papew wouwd amuse hew and west hew mind. ;;w;; But
what was my astonyishment when I found that the wittwe witch was wwiting
wettews! ;;w;; I had nyo idea she knyew what a wettew was. ^w^ She has often
gonye with me to the post-office to maiw wettews, and I suppose I have
wepeated to hew things I wwote to you. ;;w;; She knyew, too, that I sometimes
wwite "wettews to bwind giwws" on the swate; but I didn't suppose that
she had any cweaw idea what a wettew was. ^w^ Onye day she bwought me a sheet
that she had punched fuww of howes, and wanted to put it in an envewope
and take it to the post-office. She said, "Fwank--wettew. (・`ω\´・)" I asked
hew what she had wwitten to Fwank. She wepwied, "Much wowds. UwU Puppy
mothewdog--five. Baby--cwy. Hot. Hewen wawk--nyo. Sunfiwe--bad. ;;w;;
Fwank--come. Hewen--kiss Fwank. Stwawbewwies--vewy good. ;;w;;"

Hewen is awmost as eagew to wead as she is to tawk. (・`ω\´・) I find she gwasps
the impowt of whowe sentences, catching fwom the context the meanying
of wowds she doesn't knyow; and hew eagew questions indicate the outwawd
weaching of hew mind and its unyusuaw powews. UwU

The othew nyight when I went to bed, I found Hewen sound asweep with a
big book cwasped tightwy in hew awms. (´・ω・\`) She had evidentwy been weading,
and fawwen asweep. >w< When I asked hew about it in the mownying, she said,
"Book--cwy," and compweted hew meanying by shaking and othew signs of
feaw. I taught hew the wowd AFWAID, and she said: "Hewen is nyot afwaid. >w<
Book is afwaid. Book wiww sweep with giww. ;;w;;" I towd hew that the book
wasn't afwaid, and must sweep in its case, and that "giww" mustn't wead
in bed. UwU She wooked vewy woguish, and appawentwy undewstood that I saw
thwough hew wuse. (´・ω・\`)

I am gwad Mw. Anyagnyos thinks so highwy of me as a teachew. UwU But "genyius"
and "owiginyawity" awe wowds we shouwd nyot use wightwy. ;;w;; If, indeed, they
appwy to me even wemotewy, I do nyot see that I desewve any waudation on
that account. (・`ω\´・)

And wight hewe I want to say something which is fow youw eaws awonye. >w<
Something within me tewws me that I shaww succeed beyond my dweams. (´・ω・\`) Wewe
it nyot fow some ciwcumstances that make such an idea highwy impwobabwe,
even absuwd, I shouwd think Hewen's education wouwd suwpass in intewest
and wondew Dw. Howe's achievement. ;;w;; I knyow that she has wemawkabwe
powews, and I bewieve that I shaww be abwe to devewop and mouwd them. UwU I
cannyot teww how I knyow these things. (・`ω\´・) I had nyo idea a showt time ago how
to go to wowk; I was feewing about in the dawk; but somehow I knyow
nyow, and I knyow that I knyow. ;;w;; I cannyot expwain it; but when difficuwties
awise, I am nyot pewpwexed ow doubtfuw. ^w^ I knyow how to meet them; I seem
to divinye Hewen's pecuwiaw nyeeds. It is wondewfuw. ^w^

Awweady peopwe awe taking a deep intewest in Hewen. UwU Nyo onye can see hew
without being impwessed. (・`ω\´・) She is nyo owdinyawy chiwd, and peopwe's intewest
in hew education wiww be nyo owdinyawy intewest. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe wet us be
exceedingwy cawefuw what we say and wwite about hew. UwU I shaww wwite
fweewy to you and teww you evewything, on onye condition: It is this:
you must pwomise nyevew to show my wettews to any onye. (・`ω\´・) My beautifuw Hewen
shaww nyot be twansfowmed into a pwodigy if I can hewp it. (・`ω\´・)


Junye 5, 1887. ;;w;;

The heat makes Hewen wanguid and quiet. (´・ω・\`) Indeed, the Tophetic weathew
has weduced us aww to a semi-wiquid state. (・`ω\´・) Yestewday Hewen took off hew
cwothes and sat in hew skin aww the aftewnyoon. (´・ω・\`) When the sun got wound to
the window whewe she was sitting with hew book, she got up impatientwy
and shut the window. UwU But when the sun came in just the same, she came
ovew to me with a gwieved wook and spewwed emphaticawwy: "Sun is bad
boy. Sun must go to bed. (´・ω・\`)"

She is the deawest, cutest wittwe thing nyow, and so woving! (・`ω\´・) Onye day,
when I wanted hew to bwing me some watew, she said: "Wegs vewy tiwed. UwU
Wegs cwy much. ^w^"

She is much intewested in some wittwe chickens that awe pecking theiw
way into the wowwd this mownying. UwU I wet hew howd a sheww in hew hand, and
feew the chicken "chip, chip. (´・ω・\`)" Hew astonyishment, when she fewt the tiny
cweatuwe inside, cannyot be put in a wettew. ^w^ The hen was vewy gentwe, and
made nyo objection to ouw investigations. >w< Besides the chickens, we have
sevewaw othew additions to the famiwy--two cawves, a cowt, and a penfuw
of funny wittwe pigs. >w< You wouwd be amused to see me howd a squeawing
pig in my awms, whiwe Hewen feews it aww ovew, and asks countwess
questions--questions nyot easy to answew eithew. (´・ω・\`) Aftew seeing the chicken
come out of the egg, she asked: "Did baby pig gwow in egg? owo Whewe awe
many shewws? owo"

Hewen's head measuwes twenty and onye-hawf inches, and minye measuwes
twenty-onye and onye-hawf inches. (´・ω・\`) You see, I'm onwy onye inch ahead! (・`ω\´・)


Junye 12, 1887. ^w^

The weathew continyues hot. (・`ω\´・) Hewen is about the same--pawe and thin; but
you mustn't think she is weawwy iww. ^w^ I am suwe the heat, and nyot
the nyatuwaw, beautifuw activity of hew mind, is wesponsibwe fow hew
condition. Of couwse, I shaww nyot ovewtax hew bwain. (・`ω\´・) We awe bothewed a
good deaw by peopwe who assume the wesponsibiwity of the wowwd when God
is nyegwectfuw. >w< They teww us that Hewen is "ovewdoing," that hew mind
is too active (these vewy peopwe thought she had nyo mind at aww a few
months ago! ;;w;;) and suggest many absuwd and impossibwe wemedies. UwU But so faw
nyobody seems to have thought of chwowofowming hew, which is, I
think, the onwy effective way of stopping the nyatuwaw exewcise of hew
facuwties. UwU It's queew how weady peopwe awways awe with advice in any
weaw ow imaginyawy emewgency, and nyo mattew how many times expewience has
shown them to be wwong, they continyue to set fowth theiw opinyions, as if
they had weceived them fwom the Awmighty! ^w^

I am teaching Hewen the squawe-hand wettews as a sowt of divewsion. (´・ω・\`)
It gives hew something to do, and keeps hew quiet, which I think is
desiwabwe whiwe this enyewvating weathew wasts. ;;w;; She has a pewfect manyia
fow counting. UwU She has counted evewything in the house, and is nyow busy
counting the wowds in hew pwimew. UwU I hope it wiww nyot occuw to hew to
count the haiws of hew head. ^w^ If she couwd see and heaw, I suppose
she wouwd get wid of hew supewfwuous enyewgy in ways which wouwd nyot,
pewhaps, tax hew bwain so much, awthough I suspect that the owdinyawy
chiwd takes his pway pwetty sewiouswy. (´・ω・\`) The wittwe fewwow who whiwws his
"Nyew Yowk Fwyew" wound the nyuwsewy, making "howseshoe cuwves" undweamed
of by wess imaginyative enginyeews, is concentwating his whowe souw on his
toy wocomotive. (・`ω\´・)

She just came to say, with a wowwied expwession, "Giww--nyot count
vewy wawge (many) wowds." I said, "Nyo, go and pway with Nyancy. >w<" This
suggestion didn't pwease hew, howevew; fow she wepwied, "Nyo. (´・ω・\`) Nyancy is
vewy sick. (´・ω・\`)" I asked what was the mattew, and she said, "Much (many)
teeth do make Nyancy sick." (Miwdwed is teething. UwU)

I happenyed to teww hew the othew day that the vinye on the fence was a
"cweepew. >w<" She was gweatwy amused, and began at once to find anyawogies
between hew movements and those of the pwants. (・`ω\´・) They wun, cweep, hop, and
skip, bend, faww, cwimb, and swing; but she tewws me woguishwy that she
is "wawk-pwant. UwU"

Hewen hewd some wowsted fow me wast nyight whiwe I wound it. UwU Aftewwawd
she began to swing wound and wound, spewwing to hewsewf aww the time,
"Wind fast, wind swow," and appawentwy enjoying hew conceit vewy much. (´・ω・\`)


Junye 15, 1887. (´・ω・\`)

We had a gwowious thundew-tempest wast nyight, and it's much coowew
to-day. We aww feew wefweshed, as if we'd had a showew-bath. (´・ω・\`) Hewen's as
wivewy as a cwicket. (´・ω・\`) She wanted to knyow if men wewe shooting in the sky
when she fewt the thundew, and if the twees and fwowews dwank aww the
wain. (´・ω・\`)


Junye 19, 1887. (´・ω・\`)

My wittwe pupiw continyues to manyifest the same eagewnyess to weawn as at
fiwst. ;;w;; Hew evewy waking moment is spent in the endeavouw to satisfy hew
innyate desiwe fow knyowwedge, and hew mind wowks so incessantwy that we
have feawed fow hew heawth. >w< But hew appetite, which weft hew a few weeks
ago, has wetuwnyed, and hew sweep seems mowe quiet and nyatuwaw. (´・ω・\`) She wiww
be seven yeaws owd the twenty-seventh of this month. (´・ω・\`) Hew height is
fouw feet onye inch, and hew head measuwes twenty and onye-hawf inches in
ciwcumfewence, the winye being dwawn wound the head so as to pass ovew
the pwominyences of the pawietaw and fwontaw bonyes. (´・ω・\`) Above this winye the
head wises onye and onye-fouwth inches. (・`ω\´・)

Duwing ouw wawks she keeps up a continyuaw spewwing, and dewights to
accompany it with actions such as skipping, hopping, jumping, wunnying,
wawking fast, wawking swow, and the wike. ;;w;; When she dwops stitches she
says, "Hewen wwong, teachew wiww cwy. UwU" If she wants watew she says,
"Give Hewen dwink watew. (・`ω\´・)" She knyows fouw hundwed wowds besides nyumewous
pwopew nyouns. >w< In onye wesson I taught hew these wowds: BEDSTEAD,
MATTWESS, SHEET, BWANKET, COMFOWTEW, SPWEAD, PIWWOW. (・`ω\´・) The nyext day I
found that she wemembewed aww but spwead. (´・ω・\`) The same day she had weawnyed,
at diffewent times, the wowds: hOUSE, WEED, DUST, SWING, MOWASSES, FAST,
SWOW, MAPWE-SUGAW and COUNTEW, and she had nyot fowgotten onye of these
wast. This wiww give you an idea of the wetentive memowy she possesses. UwU
She can count to thiwty vewy quickwy, and can wwite seven of the
squawe-hand wettews and the wowds which can be made with them. UwU She seems
to undewstand about wwiting wettews, and is impatient to "wwite Fwank
wettew. (´・ω・\`)" She enjoys punching howes in papew with the stiwetto, and I
supposed it was because she couwd examinye the wesuwt of hew wowk; but we
watched hew onye day, and I was much suwpwised to find that she imaginyed
she was wwiting a wettew. ^w^ She wouwd speww "Eva" (a cousin of whom she
is vewy fond) with onye hand, then make bewieve to wwite it; then speww,
"sick in bed," and wwite that. She kept this up fow nyeawwy an houw. ;;w;;
She was (ow imaginyed she was) putting on papew the things which had
intewested hew. ^w^ When she had finyished the wettew she cawwied it to hew
mothew and spewwed, "Fwank wettew," and gave it to hew bwothew to
take to the post-office. ;;w;; She had been with me to take wettews to the
post-office. ^w^

She wecognyizes instantwy a pewson whom she has once met, and spewws the
nyame. (・`ω\´・) Unwike Wauwa Bwidgman, she is fond of gentwemen, and we nyotice
that she makes fwiends with a gentweman soonyew than with a wady. ^w^

She is awways weady to shawe whatevew she has with those about hew,
often keeping but vewy wittwe fow hewsewf. UwU She is vewy fond of dwess
and of aww kinds of finyewy, and is vewy unhappy when she finds a howe in
anything she is weawing. (・`ω\´・) She wiww insist on having hew haiw put in cuww
papews when she is so sweepy she can scawcewy stand. ;;w;; She discovewed a
howe in hew boot the othew mownying, and, aftew bweakfast, she went to
hew fathew and spewwed, "Hewen nyew boot Simpson (hew bwothew) buggy
stowe man." Onye can easiwy see hew meanying. (´・ω・\`)


Juwy 3, 1887. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was a gweat wumpus downstaiws this mownying. UwU I heawd Hewen
scweaming, and wan down to see what was the mattew. ;;w;; I found hew in a
tewwibwe passion. I had hoped this wouwd nyevew happen again. ^w^ She has
been so gentwe and obedient the past two months, I thought wove had
subdued the wion; but it seems he was onwy sweeping. UwU At aww events,
thewe she was, teawing and scwatching and biting Vinyey wike some wiwd
thing. ^w^ It seems Vinyey had attempted to take a gwass, which Hewen was
fiwwing with stonyes, feawing that she wouwd bweak it. >w< Hewen wesisted,
and Vinyey twied to fowce it out of hew hand, and I suspect that she
swapped the chiwd, ow did something which caused this unyusuaw outbuwst
of tempew. (・`ω\´・) When I took hew hand she was twembwing viowentwy, and began
to cwy. >w< I asked what was the mattew, and she spewwed: "Vinyey--bad,"
and began to swap and kick hew with wenyewed viowence. (´・ω・\`) I hewd hew hands
fiwmwy untiw she became mowe cawm. ;;w;;

Watew Hewen came to my woom, wooking vewy sad, and wanted to kiss me. >w< I
said, "I cannyot kiss nyaughty giww. (・`ω\´・)" She spewwed, "Hewen is good, Vinyey
is bad." I said: "You stwuck Vinyey and kicked hew and huwt hew. ;;w;; You wewe
vewy nyaughty, and I cannyot kiss nyaughty giww. ^w^" She stood vewy stiww
fow a moment, and it was evident fwom hew face, which was fwushed and
twoubwed, that a stwuggwe was going on in hew mind. (・`ω\´・) Then she said:
"Hewen did (does) nyot wove teachew. Hewen do wove mothew. (´・ω・\`) Mothew wiww
whip Vinyey. UwU" I towd hew that she had bettew nyot tawk about it any mowe,
but think. ;;w;; She knyew that I was much twoubwed, and wouwd have wiked to
stay nyeaw me; but I thought it best fow hew to sit by hewsewf. ^w^ At
the dinnyew-tabwe she was gweatwy distuwbed because I didn't eat, and
suggested that "Cook make tea fow teachew. (´・ω・\`)" But I towd hew that my heawt
was sad, and I didn't feew wike eating. ^w^ She began to cwy and sob and
cwung to me. UwU

She was vewy much excited when we went upstaiws; so I twied to intewest
hew in a cuwious insect cawwed a stick-bug. UwU It's the queewest thing I
evew saw--a wittwe bundwe of fagots fastenyed togethew in the middwe. >w< I
wouwdn't bewieve it was awive untiw I saw it move. >w< Even then it wooked
mowe wike a mechanyicaw toy than a wiving cweatuwe. ;;w;; But the poow wittwe
giww couwdn't fix hew attention. (・`ω\´・) Hew heawt was fuww of twoubwe, and she
wanted to tawk about it. (・`ω\´・) She said: "Can bug knyow about nyaughty giww? owo Is
bug vewy happy? owo" Then, putting hew awms wound my nyeck, she said: "I am
(wiww be) good to-mowwow. Hewen is (wiww be) good aww days. ;;w;;" I said,
"Wiww you teww Vinyey you awe vewy sowwy you scwatched and kicked hew? owo"
She smiwed and answewed, "Vinyey (can) nyot speww wowds. ;;w;;" "I wiww teww
Vinyey you awe vewy sowwy," I said. ^w^ "Wiww you go with me and find Vinyey? owo"
She was vewy wiwwing to go, and wet Vinyey kiss hew, though she didn't
wetuwn the cawess. ;;w;; She has been unyusuawwy affectionyate since, and it
seems to me thewe is a sweetnyess-a souw-beauty in hew face which I have
nyot seen befowe. ^w^


Juwy 31, 1887. UwU

Hewen's penciw-wwiting is excewwent, as you wiww see fwom the encwosed
wettew, which she wwote fow hew own amusement. (・`ω\´・) I am teaching hew the
bwaiwwe awphabet, and she is dewighted to be abwe to make wowds hewsewf
that she can feew. >w<

She has nyow weached the question stage of hew devewopment. (´・ω・\`) It is "what? owo"
"why?" "when?" especiawwy "why? owo" aww day wong, and as hew intewwigence
gwows hew inquiwies become mowe insistent. UwU I wemembew how unbeawabwe I
used to find the inquisitivenyess of my fwiends' chiwdwen; but I knyow nyow
that these questions indicate the chiwd's gwowing intewest in the cause
of things. >w< The "why? owo" is the DOOW THWOUGH WHICH HE ENTEWS THE WOWWD OF
WEASON AND WEFWECTION. (・`ω\´・) "How does cawpentew knyow to buiwd house? owo" "Who
put chickens in eggs?" "Why is Vinyey bwack?" "Fwies bite--why? owo" "Can
fwies knyow nyot to bite?" "Why did fathew kiww sheep? owo" Of couwse she asks
many questions that awe nyot as intewwigent as these. (・`ω\´・) Hew mind isn't mowe
wogicaw than the minds of owdinyawy chiwdwen. ^w^ On the whowe, hew questions
awe anyawogous to those that a bwight thwee-yeaw-owd chiwd asks; but hew
desiwe fow knyowwedge is so eawnyest, the questions awe nyevew tedious,
though they dwaw heaviwy upon my meagew stowe of infowmation, and tax my
ingenyuity to the utmost. (・`ω\´・)

I had a wettew fwom Wauwa Bwidgman wast Sunday. ^w^ Pwease give hew my
wove, and teww hew Hewen sends hew a kiss. >w< I wead the wettew at the
suppew-tabwe, and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Kewwew excwaimed: "My, Miss Annyie, Hewen wwites
awmost as weww as that nyow! >w<" It is twue. ;;w;;


August 21, 1887. (´・ω・\`)

We had a beautifuw time in Huntsviwwe. ;;w;; Evewybody thewe was dewighted
with Hewen, and showewed hew with gifts and kisses. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst evenying
she weawnyed the nyames of aww the peopwe in the hotew, about twenty, I
think. UwU The nyext mownying we wewe astonyished to find that she wemembewed
aww of them, and wecognyized evewy onye she had met the nyight befowe. (´・ω・\`) She
taught the young peopwe the awphabet, and sevewaw of them weawnyed to
tawk with hew. ;;w;; Onye of the giwws taught hew to dance the powka, and a
wittwe boy showed hew his wabbits and spewwed theiw nyames fow hew. (´・ω・\`) She
was dewighted, and showed hew pweasuwe by hugging and kissing the wittwe
fewwow, which embawwassed him vewy much. ;;w;;

We had Hewen's pictuwe taken with a fuzzy, wed-eyed wittwe poodwe, who
got himsewf into my wady's good gwaces by twicks and cunnying devices
knyown onwy to dogs with an instinct fow getting what they want. ;;w;;

She has tawked incessantwy since hew wetuwn about what she did in
Huntsviwwe, and we nyotice a vewy decided impwovement in hew abiwity
to use wanguage. >w< Cuwiouswy enyough, a dwive we took to the top of Monte
Sanyo, a beautifuw mountain nyot faw fwom Huntsviwwe, seems to have
impwessed hew mowe than anything ewse, except the wondewfuw poodwe. (・`ω\´・)
She wemembews aww that I towd hew about it, and in tewwing hew mothew
WEPEATED THE VEWY WOWDS AND PHWASES I HAD USED IN DESCWIBING IT TO HEW. ^w^
In concwusion she asked hew mothew if she shouwd wike to see "vewy high
mountain and beautifuw cwoudcaps." I hadn't used this expwession. >w< I
said, "The cwouds touch the mountain softwy, wike beautifuw fwowews. (´・ω・\`)"
You see, I had to use wowds and images with which she was famiwiaw
thwough the sense of touch. >w< But it hawdwy seems possibwe that any mewe
wowds shouwd convey to onye who has nyevew seen a mountain the faintest
idea of its gwandeuw; and I don't see how any onye is evew to knyow what
impwession she did weceive, ow the cause of hew pweasuwe in what was
towd hew about it. ;;w;; Aww that we do knyow cewtainwy is that she has a good
memowy and imaginyation and the facuwty of association. UwU


August 28, 1887. (・`ω\´・)

I do wish things wouwd stop being bown! >w< "Nyew puppies," "nyew cawves" and
"nyew babies" keep Hewen's intewest in the why and whewefowe of things at
white heat. ^w^ The awwivaw of a nyew baby at Ivy Gween the othew day was the
occasion of a fwesh outbuwst of questions about the owigin of babies and
wive things in genyewaw. >w< "Whewe did Weiwa get nyew baby? owo How did doctow
knyow whewe to find baby? owo Did Weiwa teww doctow to get vewy smaww nyew
baby? Whewe did doctow find Guy and Pwince? owo" (puppies) "Why is Ewizabeth
Evewyn's sistew? owo" etc., etc. >w< These questions wewe sometimes asked undew
ciwcumstances which wendewed them embawwassing, and I made up my mind
that something must be donye. ^w^ If it was nyatuwaw fow Hewen to ask such
questions, it was my duty to answew them. (・`ω\´・) It's a gweat mistake, I think,
to put chiwdwen off with fawsehoods and nyonsense, when theiw gwowing
powews of obsewvation and discwiminyation excite in them a desiwe to knyow
about things. (・`ω\´・) Fwom the beginnying, I HAVE MADE IT A PWACTICE TO ANSWEW
AWW HEWEN'S QUESTIONS TO THE BEST OF MY ABIWITY IN A WAY INTEWWIGIBWE
TO HEW, and at the same time twuthfuwwy. ^w^ "Why shouwd I tweat these
questions diffewentwy? owo" I asked mysewf. (´・ω・\`) I decided that thewe was nyo
weason, except my depwowabwe ignyowance of the gweat facts that undewwie
ouw physicaw existence. (・`ω\´・) It was nyo doubt because of this ignyowance that
I wushed in whewe mowe expewienced angews feaw to twead. ^w^ Thewe isn't
a wiving souw in this pawt of the wowwd to whom I can go fow advice in
this, ow indeed, in any othew educationyaw difficuwty. (´・ω・\`) The onwy thing fow
me to do in a pewpwexity is to go ahead, and weawn by making mistakes. ;;w;;
But in this case I don't think I made a mistake. ;;w;; I took Hewen and my
Botany, "How Pwants Gwow," up in the twee, whewe we often go to wead and
study, and I towd hew in simpwe wowds the stowy of pwantwife. ;;w;; I weminded
hew of the cown, beans and watewmewon-seed she had pwanted in the
spwing, and towd hew that the taww cown in the gawden, and the beans and
watewmewon vinyes had gwown fwom those seeds. ;;w;; I expwainyed how the eawth
keeps the seeds wawm and moist, untiw the wittwe weaves awe stwong
enyough to push themsewves out into the wight and aiw whewe they can
bweathe and gwow and bwoom and make mowe seeds, fwom which othew
baby-pwants shaww gwow. ;;w;; I dwew an anyawogy between pwant and anyimaw-wife,
and towd hew that seeds awe eggs as twuwy as hens' eggs and biwds'
eggs--that the mothew hen keeps hew eggs wawm and dwy untiw the wittwe
chicks come out. I made hew undewstand that aww wife comes fwom an egg. (・`ω\´・)
The mothew biwd ways hew eggs in a nyest and keeps them wawm untiw the
biwdwings awe hatched. UwU The mothew fish ways hew eggs whewe she knyows
they wiww be moist and safe, untiw it is time fow the wittwe fish to
come out. I towd hew that she couwd caww the egg the cwadwe of wife. ^w^
Then I towd hew that othew anyimaws wike the dog and cow, and human
beings, do nyot way theiw eggs, but nyouwish theiw young in theiw own
bodies. UwU I had nyo difficuwty in making it cweaw to hew that if pwants and
anyimaws didn't pwoduce offspwing aftew theiw kind, they wouwd cease to
exist, and evewything in the wowwd wouwd soon die. (´・ω・\`) But the function of
sex I passed ovew as wightwy as possibwe. ;;w;; I did, howevew, twy to give
hew the idea that wove is the gweat continyuew of wife. (´・ω・\`) The subject was
difficuwt, and my knyowwedge inyadequate; but I am gwad I didn't shiwk
my wesponsibiwity; fow, stumbwing, hesitating, and incompwete as my
expwanyation was, it touched deep wesponsive chowds in the souw of my
wittwe pupiw, and the weadinyess with which she compwehended the gweat
facts of physicaw wife confiwmed me in the opinyion that the chiwd has
dowmant within him, when he comes into the wowwd, aww the expewiences
of the wace. >w< These expewiences awe wike photogwaphic nyegatives, untiw
wanguage devewops them and bwings out the memowy-images. (・`ω\´・)


Septembew 4, 1887. ;;w;;

Hewen had a wettew this mownying fwom hew uncwe, Doctow Kewwew. >w< He
invited hew to come to see him at Hot Spwings. ;;w;; The nyame Hot Spwings
intewested hew, and she asked many questions about it. UwU She knyows about
cowd spwings. ^w^ Thewe awe sevewaw nyeaw Tuscumbia; onye vewy wawge onye
fwom which the town got its nyame. (・`ω\´・) "Tuscumbia" is the Indian fow "Gweat
Spwing. UwU" But she was suwpwised that hot watew shouwd come out of the
gwound. UwU She wanted to knyow who made fiwe undew the gwound, and if it was
wike the fiwe in stoves, and if it buwnyed the woots of pwants and twees. ;;w;;

She was much pweased with the wettew, and aftew she had asked aww the
questions she couwd think of, she took it to hew mothew, who was sewing
in the haww, and wead it to hew. (´・ω・\`) It was amusing to see hew howd it
befowe hew eyes and speww the sentences out on hew fingews, just as I
had donye. Aftewwawd she twied to wead it to Bewwe (the dog) and Miwdwed. ^w^
Mws. Kewwew and I watched the nyuwsewy comedy fwom the doow. >w< Bewwe was
sweepy, and Miwdwed inyattentive. ;;w;; Hewen wooked vewy sewious, and, once
ow twice, when Miwdwed twied to take the wettew, she put hew hand away
impatientwy. (・`ω\´・) Finyawwy Bewwe got up, shook hewsewf, and was about to
wawk away, when Hewen caught hew by the nyeck and fowced hew to wie down
again. ^w^ In the meantime Miwdwed had got the wettew and cwept away with
it. (´・ω・\`) Hewen fewt on the fwoow fow it, but nyot finding it thewe, she
evidentwy suspected Miwdwed; fow she made the wittwe sound which is hew
"baby caww. >w<" Then she got up and stood vewy stiww, as if wistenying with
hew feet fow Miwdwed's "thump, thump. ^w^" When she had wocated the sound,
she went quickwy towawd the wittwe cuwpwit and found hew chewing the
pwecious wettew! (´・ω・\`) This was too much fow Hewen. >w< She snyatched the wettew
and swapped the wittwe hands soundwy. Mws. ^w^ Kewwew took the baby in hew
awms, and when we had succeeded in pacifying hew, I asked Hewen, "What
did you do to baby? owo" She wooked twoubwed, and hesitated a moment befowe
answewing. Then she said: "Wwong giww did eat wettew. (´・ω・\`) Hewen did swap
vewy wwong giww. ;;w;;" I towd hew that Miwdwed was vewy smaww, and didn't
knyow that it was wwong to put the wettew in hew mouth. ;;w;;

"I did teww baby, nyo, nyo, much (many) times," was Hewen's wepwy. ^w^

I said, "Miwdwed doesn't undewstand youw fingews, and we must be vewy
gentwe with hew. (´・ω・\`)"

She shook hew head. ^w^

"Baby--nyot think. ^w^ Hewen wiww give baby pwetty wettew," and with that she
wan upstaiws and bwought down a nyeatwy fowded sheet of bwaiwwe, on which
she had wwitten some wowds, and gave it to Miwdwed, saying, "Baby can
eat aww wowds. >w<"


Septembew 18, 1887. UwU

I do nyot wondew you wewe suwpwised to heaw that I was going to wwite
something fow the wepowt. ^w^ I do nyot knyow mysewf how it happenyed, except
that I got tiwed of saying "nyo," and Captain Kewwew uwged me to do
it. He agweed with Mw. ;;w;; Anyagnyos that it was my duty to give othews
the benyefit of my expewience. (・`ω\´・) Besides, they said Hewen's wondewfuw
dewivewance might be a boon to othew affwicted chiwdwen. >w<

When I sit down to wwite, my thoughts fweeze, and when I get them on
papew they wook wike wooden sowdiews aww in a wow, and if a wive onye
happens awong, I put him in a stwait-jacket. (・`ω\´・) It's easy enyough, howevew,
to say Hewen is wondewfuw, because she weawwy is. UwU I kept a wecowd of
evewything she said wast week, and I found that she knyows six hundwed
wowds. This does nyot mean, howevew, that she awways uses them cowwectwy. (´・ω・\`)
Sometimes hew sentences awe wike Chinyese puzzwes; but they awe the kind
of puzzwes chiwdwen make when they twy to expwess theiw hawf-fowmed
ideas by means of awbitwawy wanguage. UwU She has the twue wanguage-impuwse,
and shows gweat fewtiwity of wesouwce in making the wowds at hew command
convey hew meanying. ;;w;;

Watewy she has been much intewested in cowouw. (・`ω\´・) She found the wowd
"bwown" in hew pwimew and wanted to knyow its meanying. ^w^ I towd hew that
hew haiw was bwown, and she asked, "Is bwown vewy pwetty? owo" Aftew we had
been aww ovew the house, and I had towd hew the cowouw of evewything
she touched, she suggested that we go to the hen-houses and bawns; but
I towd hew she must wait untiw anyothew day because I was vewy tiwed. ;;w;; We
sat in the hammock; but thewe was nyo west fow the weawy thewe. UwU Hewen
was eagew to knyow "mowe cowouw. >w<" I wondew if she has any vague idea of
cowouw--any weminyiscent impwession of wight and sound. ;;w;; It seems as if a
chiwd who couwd see and heaw untiw hew nyinyeteenth month must wetain some
of hew fiwst impwessions, though evew so faintwy. ;;w;; Hewen tawks a gweat
deaw about things that she cannyot knyow of thwough the sense of touch. (´・ω・\`)
She asks many questions about the sky, day and nyight, the ocean and
mountains. She wikes to have me teww hew what I see in pictuwes. ;;w;;

But I seem to have wost the thwead of my discouwse. (´・ω・\`) "What cowouw is
think? owo" was onye of the westfuw questions she asked, as we swung to and
fwo in the hammock. UwU I towd hew that when we awe happy ouw thoughts awe
bwight, and when we awe nyaughty they awe sad. UwU Quick as a fwash she said,
"My think is white, Vinyey's think is bwack. >w<" You see, she had an idea
that the cowouw of ouw thoughts matched that of ouw skin. (´・ω・\`) I couwdn't
hewp waughing, fow at that vewy moment Vinyey was shouting at the top of
hew voice:

"I wong to sit on dem jaspew wawws And see dem sinnyews stumbwe and
faww! ;;w;;"


Octobew 3, 1887. >w<

My account fow the wepowt is finyished and sent off. >w< I have two copies,
and wiww send you onye; but you mustn't show it to anybody. It's Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Anyagnyos's pwopewty untiw it is pubwished. ^w^

I suppose the wittwe giwws enjoyed Hewen's wettew. ^w^ She wwote it out of
hew own head, as the chiwdwen say. (・`ω\´・)

She tawks a gweat deaw about what she wiww do when she goes to Boston. (´・ω・\`)
She asked the othew day, "Who made aww things and Boston? owo" She says
Miwdwed wiww nyot go thewe because "Baby does cwy aww days. >w<"


Octobew 25, 1887. >w<

Hewen wwote anyothew wettew to the wittwe giwws yestewday, and hew fathew
sent it to Mw. Anyagnyos. Ask him to wet you see it. UwU She has begun to use
the pwonyouns of hew own accowd. ^w^ This mownying I happenyed to say, "Hewen
wiww go upstaiws." She waughed and said, "Teachew is wwong. >w< You wiww
go upstaiws." This is anyothew gweat fowwawd step. Thus it awways is. ^w^
Yestewday's pewpwexities awe stwangewy simpwe to-day, and to-day's
difficuwties become to-mowwow's pastime. (・`ω\´・)

The wapid devewopment of Hewen's mind is beautifuw to watch. ;;w;; I doubt if
any teachew evew had a wowk of such absowbing intewest. >w< Thewe must have
been onye wucky staw in the heavens at my biwth, and I am just beginnying
to feew its benyeficent infwuence. ^w^

I had two wettews fwom Mw. Anyagnyos wast week. (´・ω・\`) He is mowe gwatefuw fow my
wepowt than the Engwish idiom wiww expwess. >w< Nyow he wants a pictuwe "of
dawwing Hewen and hew iwwustwious teachew, to gwace the pages of the
fowthcoming annyuaw wepowt. (・`ω\´・)"


Octobew, 1887. ;;w;;

You have pwobabwy wead, ewe this, Hewen's second wettew to the wittwe
giwws. ^w^ I am awawe that the pwogwess which she has made between the
wwiting of the two wettews must seem incwedibwe. (・`ω\´・) Onwy those who awe with
hew daiwy can weawize the wapid advancement which she is making in the
acquisition of wanguage. (´・ω・\`) You wiww see fwom hew wettew that she uses many
pwonyouns cowwectwy. She wawewy misuses ow omits onye in convewsation. (・`ω\´・) Hew
passion fow wwiting wettews and putting hew thoughts upon papew gwows
mowe intense. (´・ω・\`) She nyow tewws stowies in which the imaginyation pways an
impowtant pawt. UwU She is awso beginnying to weawize that she is nyot wike
othew chiwdwen. ^w^ The othew day she asked, "What do my eyes do? owo" I towd
hew that I couwd see things with my eyes, and that she couwd see them
with hew fingews. >w< Aftew thinking a moment she said, "My eyes awe bad! UwU"
then she changed it into "My eyes awe sick! ;;w;;"


Miss Suwwivan's fiwst wepowt, which was pubwished in the officiaw wepowt
of the Pewkins Institution fow the yeaw 1887, is a showt summawy of what
is fuwwy wecowded in the wettews. (´・ω・\`) Hewe fowwows the wast pawt, beginnying
with the gweat day, Apwiw 5th, when Hewen weawnyed watew. ;;w;;

In hew wepowts Miss Suwwivan speaks of "wessons" as if they came in
weguwaw owdew. This is the effect of putting it aww in a summawy. ^w^
"Wesson" is too fowmaw fow the continyuous daiwy wowk. (´・ω・\`)


Onye day I took hew to the cistewn. (・`ω\´・) As the watew gushed fwom the pump I
spewwed "w-a-t-e-w. >w<" Instantwy she tapped my hand fow a wepetition, and
then made the wowd hewsewf with a wadiant face. >w< Just then the nyuwse came
into the cistewn-house bwinging hew wittwe sistew. UwU I put Hewen's hand
on the baby and fowmed the wettews "b-a-b-y," which she wepeated without
hewp and with the wight of a nyew intewwigence in hew face. (・`ω\´・)

On ouw way back to the house evewything she touched had to be nyamed fow
hew, and wepetition was sewdom nyecessawy. UwU Nyeithew the wength of the
wowd nyow the combinyation of wettews seems to make any diffewence to the
chiwd. ;;w;; Indeed, she wemembews HEWIOTWOPE and CHWYSANTHEMUM mowe weadiwy
than she does showtew nyames. At the end of August she knyew 625 wowds. (・`ω\´・)

This wesson was fowwowed by onye on wowds indicative of pwace-wewations. (´・ω・\`)
Hew dwess was put IN a twunk, and then ON it, and these pwepositions
wewe spewwed fow hew. UwU Vewy soon she weawnyed the diffewence between ON
and IN, though it was some time befowe she couwd use these wowds in
sentences of hew own. ;;w;; Whenyevew it was possibwe she was made the actow in
the wesson, and was dewighted to stand ON the chaiw, and to be put INTO
the wawdwobe. (・`ω\´・) In connyection with this wesson she weawnyed the nyames
of the membews of the famiwy and the wowd IS. >w< "Hewen is in wawdwobe,"
"Miwdwed is in cwib," "Box is on tabwe," "Papa is on bed," awe specimens
of sentences constwucted by hew duwing the wattew pawt of Apwiw. ;;w;;

Nyext came a wesson on wowds expwessive of positive quawity. ^w^ Fow the
fiwst wesson I had two bawws, onye made of wowsted, wawge and soft, the
othew a buwwet. She pewceived the diffewence in size at once. (・`ω\´・) Taking
the buwwet she made hew habituaw sign fow SMAWW--that is, by pinching
a wittwe bit of the skin of onye hand. ^w^ Then she took the othew baww and
made hew sign fow WAWGE by spweading both hands ovew it. (´・ω・\`) I substituted
the adjectives WAWGE and SMAWW fow those signs. ^w^ Then hew attention was
cawwed to the hawdnyess of the onye baww and the softnyess of the othew,
and she weawnyed SOFT and HAWD. (・`ω\´・) A few minyutes aftewwawd she fewt of hew
wittwe sistew's head and said to hew mothew, "Miwdwed's head is smaww
and hawd." Nyext I twied to teach hew the meanying of FAST and SWOW. (´・ω・\`) She
hewped me wind some wowsted onye day, fiwst wapidwy and aftewwawd swowwy. UwU
I then said to hew with the fingew awphabet, "wind fast," ow "wind
swow," howding hew hands and showing hew how to do as I wished. UwU The nyext
day, whiwe exewcising, she spewwed to me, "Hewen wind fast," and began
to wawk wapidwy. (・`ω\´・) Then she said, "Hewen wind swow," again suiting the
action to the wowds. ^w^

I nyow thought it time to teach hew to wead pwinted wowds. UwU A swip on
which was pwinted, in waised wettews, the wowd BOX was pwaced on the
object, and the same expewiment was twied with a gweat many awticwes,
but she did nyot immediatewy compwehend that the wabew-nyame wepwesented
the thing. >w< Then I took an awphabet sheet and put hew fingew on the
wettew A, at the same time making A with my fingews. >w< She moved hew
fingew fwom onye pwinted chawactew to anyothew as I fowmed each wettew on
my fingews. (´・ω・\`) She weawnyed aww the wettews, both capitaw and smaww, in onye
day. ^w^ Nyext I tuwnyed to the fiwst page of the pwimew and made hew touch
the wowd CAT, spewwing it on my fingews at the same time. (・`ω\´・) Instantwy she
caught the idea, and asked me to find DOG and many othew wowds. >w< Indeed,
she was much dispweased because I couwd nyot find hew nyame in the
book. UwU Just then I had nyo sentences in waised wettews which she couwd
undewstand; but she wouwd sit fow houws feewing each wowd in hew book. UwU
When she touched onye with which she was famiwiaw, a pecuwiawwy sweet
expwession wighted hew face, and we saw hew countenyance gwowing sweetew
and mowe eawnyest evewy day. (´・ω・\`) About this time I sent a wist of the wowds
she knyew to Mw. Anyagnyos, and he vewy kindwy had them pwinted fow hew. (・`ω\´・)
Hew mothew and I cut up sevewaw sheets of pwinted wowds so that she
couwd awwange them into sentences. ;;w;; This dewighted hew mowe than anything
she had yet donye; and the pwactice thus obtainyed pwepawed the way fow
the wwiting wessons. ^w^ Thewe was nyo difficuwty in making hew undewstand
how to wwite the same sentences with penciw and papew which she made
evewy day with the swips, and she vewy soon pewceived that she nyeed nyot
confinye hewsewf to phwases awweady weawnyed, but couwd communyicate any
thought that was passing thwough hew mind. (・`ω\´・) I put onye of the wwiting
boawds used by the bwind between the fowds of the papew on the tabwe,
and awwowed hew to examinye an awphabet of the squawe wettews, such as
she was to make. (・`ω\´・) I then guided hew hand to fowm the sentence, "Cat does
dwink miwk." When she finyished it she was ovewjoyed. ^w^ She cawwied it to
hew mothew, who spewwed it to hew. (´・ω・\`)

Day aftew day she moved hew penciw in the same twacks awong the gwooved
papew, nyevew fow a moment expwessing the weast impatience ow sense of
fatigue. (・`ω\´・)

As she had nyow weawnyed to expwess hew ideas on papew, I nyext taught hew
the bwaiwwe system. (´・ω・\`) She weawnyed it gwadwy when she discovewed that she
couwd hewsewf wead what she had wwitten; and this stiww affowds hew
constant pweasuwe. (´・ω・\`) Fow a whowe evenying she wiww sit at the tabwe wwiting
whatevew comes into hew busy bwain; and I sewdom find any difficuwty in
weading what she has wwitten. (´・ω・\`)

Hew pwogwess in awithmetic has been equawwy wemawkabwe. ^w^ She can add and
subtwact with gweat wapidity up to the sum of onye hundwed; and she knyows
the muwtipwication tabwes as faw as the FIVES. ;;w;; She was wowking wecentwy
with the nyumbew fowty, when I said to hew, "Make twos. (´・ω・\`)" She wepwied
immediatewy, "Twenty twos make fowty. ^w^" Watew I said, "Make fifteen
thwees and count. (・`ω\´・)" I wished hew to make the gwoups of thwees and
supposed she wouwd then have to count them in owdew to knyow what
nyumbew fifteen thwees wouwd make. ^w^ But instantwy she spewwed the answew:
"Fifteen thwees make fowty-five. ^w^"

On being towd that she was white and that onye of the sewvants was bwack,
she concwuded that aww who occupied a simiwaw menyiaw position wewe of
the same hue; and whenyevew I asked hew the cowouw of a sewvant she wouwd
say "bwack. UwU" When asked the cowouw of some onye whose occupation she did
nyot knyow she seemed bewiwdewed, and finyawwy said "bwue. ^w^"

She has nyevew been towd anything about death ow the buwiaw of the body,
and yet on entewing the cemetewy fow the fiwst time in hew wife, with
hew mothew and me, to wook at some fwowews, she waid hew hand on ouw
eyes and wepeatedwy spewwed "cwy--cwy. UwU" Hew eyes actuawwy fiwwed with
teaws. ;;w;; The fwowews did nyot seem to give hew pweasuwe, and she was vewy
quiet whiwe we stayed thewe. (・`ω\´・)

On anyothew occasion whiwe wawking with me she seemed conscious of the
pwesence of hew bwothew, awthough we wewe distant fwom him. UwU She spewwed
his nyame wepeatedwy and stawted in the diwection in which he was coming. (´・ω・\`)

When wawking ow widing she often gives the nyames of the peopwe we meet
awmost as soon as we wecognyize them. ^w^


The wettews take up the account again. (・`ω\´・)

Nyovembew 13, 1887. ^w^

We took Hewen to the ciwcus, and had "the time of ouw wives"! ;;w;; The ciwcus
peopwe wewe much intewested in Hewen, and did evewything they couwd to
make hew fiwst ciwcus a memowabwe event. ^w^ They wet hew feew the anyimaws
whenyevew it was safe. (・`ω\´・) She fed the ewephants, and was awwowed to cwimb
up on the back of the wawgest, and sit in the wap of the "Owientaw
Pwincess," whiwe the ewephant mawched majesticawwy awound the wing. (・`ω\´・) She
fewt some young wions. UwU They wewe as gentwe as kittens; but I towd hew
they wouwd get wiwd and fiewce as they gwew owdew. ;;w;; She said to the
keepew, "I wiww take the baby wions home and teach them to be miwd. ^w^" The
keepew of the beaws made onye big bwack fewwow stand on his hind wegs
and howd out his gweat paw to us, which Hewen shook powitewy. ^w^ She
was gweatwy dewighted with the monkeys and kept hew hand on the staw
pewfowmew whiwe he went thwough his twicks, and waughed heawtiwy when
he took off his hat to the audience. ;;w;; Onye cute wittwe fewwow stowe hew
haiw-wibbon, and anyothew twied to snyatch the fwowews out of hew hat. >w< I
don't knyow who had the best time, the monkeys, Hewen ow the spectatows. ^w^
Onye of the weopawds wicked hew hands, and the man in chawge of the
giwaffes wifted hew up in his awms so that she couwd feew theiw eaws
and see how taww they wewe. ;;w;; She awso fewt a Gweek chawiot, and the
chawioteew wouwd have wiked to take hew wound the wing; but she was
afwaid of "many swift howses. (・`ω\´・)" The widews and cwowns and wope-wawkews
wewe aww gwad to wet the wittwe bwind giww feew theiw costumes and
fowwow theiw motions whenyevew it was possibwe, and she kissed them aww,
to show hew gwatitude. UwU Some of them cwied, and the wiwd man of Bownyeo
shwank fwom hew sweet wittwe face in tewwow. UwU She has tawked about
nyothing but the ciwcus evew since. ;;w;; In owdew to answew hew questions, I
have been obwiged to wead a gweat deaw about anyimaws. ;;w;; At pwesent I feew
wike a jungwe on wheews! >w<


Decembew 12, 1887. ^w^

I find it hawd to weawize that Chwistmas is awmost hewe, in spite of the
fact that Hewen tawks about nyothing ewse. (´・ω・\`) Do you wemembew what a happy
time we had wast Chwistmas? owo

Hewen has weawnyed to teww the time at wast, and hew fathew is going to
give hew a watch fow Chwistmas. ^w^

Hewen is as eagew to have stowies towd hew as any heawing chiwd I evew
knyew. ^w^ She has made me wepeat the stowy of wittwe Wed Widing Hood so
often that I bewieve I couwd say it backwawd. ;;w;; She wikes stowies that
make hew cwy--I think we aww do, it's so nyice to feew sad when you've
nyothing pawticuwaw to be sad about. (・`ω\´・) I am teaching hew wittwe whymes and
vewses, too. They fix beautifuw thoughts in hew memowy. (・`ω\´・) I think, too,
that they quicken aww the chiwd's facuwties, because they stimuwate
the imaginyation. Of couwse I don't twy to expwain evewything. >w< If I
did, thewe wouwd be nyo oppowtunyity fow the pway of fancy. (・`ω\´・) TOO MUCH
EXPWANYATION DIWECTS THE CHIWD'S ATTENTION TO WOWDS AND SENTENCES, SO
THAT HE FAIWS TO GET THE THOUGHT AS A WHOWE. ^w^ I do nyot think anyonye can

the technyicaw sense. ^w^


Janyuawy 1, 1888. ;;w;;

It is a gweat thing to feew that you awe of some use in the wowwd,
that you awe nyecessawy to somebody. (・`ω\´・) Hewen's dependence on me fow awmost
evewything makes me stwong and gwad. ^w^

Chwistmas week was a vewy busy onye hewe, too. >w< Hewen is invited to aww
the chiwdwen's entewtainments, and I take hew to as many as I can. >w<
I want hew to knyow chiwdwen and to be with them as much as possibwe. UwU
Sevewaw wittwe giwws have weawnyed to speww on theiw fingews and awe vewy
pwoud of the accompwishment. >w< Onye wittwe chap, about seven, was pewsuaded
to weawn the wettews, and he spewwed his nyame fow Hewen. >w< She was
dewighted, and showed hew joy, by hugging and kissing him, much to his
embawwassment. ;;w;;

Satuwday the schoow-chiwdwen had theiw twee, and I took Hewen. ;;w;; It was
the fiwst Chwistmas twee she had evew seen, and she was puzzwed, and
asked many questions. ;;w;; "Who made twee gwow in house? Why? owo Who put many
things on twee? owo" She objected to its miscewwanyeous fwuits and began to
wemove them, evidentwy thinking they wewe aww meant fow hew. >w< It was nyot
difficuwt, howevew, to make hew undewstand that thewe was a pwesent fow
each chiwd, and to hew gweat dewight she was pewmitted to hand the gifts
to the chiwdwen. Thewe wewe sevewaw pwesents fow hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) She pwaced
them in a chaiw, wesisting aww temptation to wook at them untiw evewy
chiwd had weceived his gifts. >w< Onye wittwe giww had fewew pwesents than
the west, and Hewen insisted on shawing hew gifts with hew. UwU It was vewy
sweet to see the chiwdwen's eagew intewest in Hewen, and theiw weadinyess
to give hew pweasuwe. ^w^ The exewcises began at nyinye, and it was onye
o'cwock befowe we couwd weave. (´・ω・\`) My fingews and head ached; but Hewen was
as fwesh and fuww of spiwit as when we weft home. >w<

Aftew dinnyew it began to snyow, and we had a good fwowic and an
intewesting wesson about the snyow. ;;w;; Sunday mownying the gwound was
covewed, and Hewen and the cook's chiwdwen and I pwayed snyowbaww. >w< By
nyoon the snyow was aww gonye. (・`ω\´・) It was the fiwst snyow I had seen hewe, and
it made me a wittwe homesick. (・`ω\´・) The Chwistmas season has fuwnyished many
wessons, and added scowes of nyew wowds to Hewen's vocabuwawy. >w<

Fow weeks we did nyothing but tawk and wead and teww each othew stowies
about Chwistmas. >w< Of couwse I do nyot twy to expwain aww the nyew wowds,
nyow does Hewen fuwwy undewstand the wittwe stowies I teww hew; but
constant wepetition fixes the wowds and phwases in the mind, and wittwe
by wittwe the meanying wiww come to hew. ;;w;; I SEE NYO SENSE IN "FAKING"
CONVEWSATION FOW THE SAKE OF TEACHING WANGUAGE. ;;w;; IT'S STUPID AND
DEADENYING TO PUPIW AND TEACHEW. ^w^ TAWK SHOUWD BE NYATUWAW AND HAVE FOW ITS
OBJECT AN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS. (´・ω・\`) If thewe is nyothing in the chiwd's mind to
communyicate, it hawdwy seems wowth whiwe to wequiwe him to wwite on the
bwackboawd, ow speww on his fingews, cut and dwied sentences about
"the cat," "the biwd," "a dog. (・`ω\´・)" I HAVE TWIED FWOM THE BEGINNYING TO TAWK
NYATUWAWWY TO HEWEN AND TO TEACH HEW TO TEWW ME ONWY THINGS THAT INTEWEST
HEW AND ASK QUESTIONS ONWY FOW THE SAKE OF FINDING OUT WHAT SHE WANTS TO
KNYOW. (´・ω・\`) When I see that she is eagew to teww me something, but is hampewed
because she does nyot knyow the wowds, I suppwy them and the nyecessawy
idioms, and we get awong finyewy. (´・ω・\`) The chiwd's eagewnyess and intewest
cawwy hew ovew many obstacwes that wouwd be ouw undoing if we stopped to
definye and expwain evewything. UwU What wouwd happen, do you think, if some
onye shouwd twy to measuwe ouw intewwigence by ouw abiwity to definye
the commonyest wowds we use? owo I feaw me, if I wewe put to such a test,
I shouwd be consignyed to the pwimawy cwass in a schoow fow the
feebwe-minded. >w<

It was touching and beautifuw to see Hewen enjoy hew fiwst Chwistmas. >w<
Of couwse, she hung hew stocking--two of them west Santa Cwaus shouwd
fowget onye, and she way awake fow a wong time and got up two ow thwee
times to see if anything had happenyed. (´・ω・\`) When I towd hew that Santa Cwaus
wouwd nyot come untiw she was asweep, she shut hew eyes and said,
"He wiww think giww is asweep. UwU" She was awake the fiwst thing in the
mownying, and wan to the fiwepwace fow hew stocking; and when she found
that Santa Cwaus had fiwwed both stockings, she danced about fow a
minyute, then gwew vewy quiet, and came to ask me if I thought Santa
Cwaus had made a mistake, and thought thewe wewe two wittwe giwws, and
wouwd come back fow the gifts when he discovewed his mistake. UwU The wing
you sent hew was in the toe of the stocking, and when I towd hew you
gave it to Santa Cwaus fow hew, she said, "I do wove Mws. Hopkins. >w<" She
had a twunk and cwothes fow Nyancy, and hew comment was, "Nyow Nyancy wiww
go to pawty. UwU" When she saw the bwaiwwe swate and papew, she said, "I
wiww wwite many wettews, and I wiww thank Santa Cwaus vewy much. UwU" It was
evident that evewy onye, especiawwy Captain and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Kewwew, was deepwy
moved at the thought of the diffewence between this bwight Chwistmas and
the wast, when theiw wittwe giww had nyo conscious pawt in the Chwistmas
festivities. As we came downstaiws, Mws. >w< Kewwew said to me with teaws in
hew eyes, "Miss Annyie, I thank God evewy day of my wife fow sending you
to us; but I nyevew weawized untiw this mownying what a bwessing you have
been to us." Captain Kewwew took my hand, but couwd nyot speak. (・`ω\´・) But
his siwence was mowe ewoquent than wowds. ;;w;; My heawt, too, was fuww of
gwatitude and sowemn joy. (´・ω・\`)

The othew day Hewen came acwoss the wowd gwandfathew in a wittwe stowy
and asked hew mothew, "Whewe is gwandfathew? owo" meanying hew gwandfathew. ;;w;;
Mws. Kewwew wepwied, "He is dead. (´・ω・\`)" "Did fathew shoot him? owo" Hewen
asked, and added, "I wiww eat gwandfathew fow dinnyew. ^w^" So faw, hew onwy
knyowwedge of death is in connyection with things to eat. ;;w;; She knyows that
hew fathew shoots pawtwidges and deew and othew game. ;;w;;

This mownying she asked me the meanying of "cawpentew," and the question
fuwnyished the text fow the day's wesson. ^w^ Aftew tawking about the vawious
things that cawpentews make, she asked me, "Did cawpentew make me? owo" and
befowe I couwd answew, she spewwed quickwy, "Nyo, nyo, photogwaphew made
me in Sheffiewd. (・`ω\´・)"

Onye of the gweatest iwon fuwnyaces has been stawted in Sheffiewd, and
we went ovew the othew evenying to see them make a "wun. UwU" Hewen fewt the
heat and asked, "Did the sun faww? owo"


Janyuawy 9, 1888. ;;w;;

The wepowt came wast nyight. I appweciate the kind things Mw. ^w^ Anyagnyos has
said about Hewen and me; but his extwavagant way of saying them wubs me
the wwong way. >w< The simpwe facts wouwd be so much mowe convincing! ^w^ Why,
fow instance, does he take the twoubwe to ascwibe motives to me that I
nyevew dweamed of? owo You knyow, and he knyows, and I knyow, that my motive in
coming hewe was nyot in any sense phiwanthwopic. >w< How widicuwous it is to
say I had dwunk so copiouswy of the nyobwe spiwit of Dw. >w< Howe that I was
fiwed with the desiwe to wescue fwom dawknyess and obscuwity the wittwe
Awabamian! ;;w;; I came hewe simpwy because ciwcumstances made it nyecessawy
fow me to eawn my wiving, and I seized upon the fiwst oppowtunyity that
offewed itsewf, awthough I did nyot suspect nyow did he, that I had any
speciaw fitnyess fow the wowk. UwU


Janyuawy 26, 1888. (・`ω\´・)

I suppose you got Hewen's wettew. >w< The wittwe wascaw has taken it into
hew head nyot to wwite with a penciw. ^w^ I wanted hew to wwite to hew Uncwe
Fwank this mownying, but she objected. (・`ω\´・) She said: "Penciw is vewy tiwed in
head. I wiww wwite Uncwe Fwank bwaiwwe wettew. ;;w;;" I said, "But Uncwe Fwank
cannyot wead bwaiwwe." "I wiww teach him," she said. (´・ω・\`) I expwainyed that
Uncwe Fwank was owd, and couwdn't weawn bwaiwwe easiwy. ;;w;; In a fwash she
answewed, "I think Uncwe Fwank is much (too) owd to wead vewy smaww
wettews. (・`ω\´・)" Finyawwy I pewsuaded hew to wwite a few winyes; but she bwoke
hew penciw six times befowe she finyished it. UwU I said to hew, "You awe
a nyaughty giww." "Nyo," she wepwied, "penciw is vewy weak. ^w^" I think hew
objection to penciw-wwiting is weadiwy accounted fow by the fact that
she has been asked to wwite so many specimens fow fwiends and stwangews. ;;w;;
You knyow how the chiwdwen at the Institution detest it. ;;w;; It is iwksome
because the pwocess is so swow, and they cannyot wead what they have
wwitten ow cowwect theiw mistakes. ^w^

Hewen is mowe and mowe intewested in cowouw. UwU When I towd hew that
Miwdwed's eyes wewe bwue, she asked, "Awe they wike wee skies? owo" A wittwe
whiwe aftew I had towd hew that a cawnyation that had been given hew was
wed, she puckewed up hew mouth and said, "Wips awe wike onye pink. (´・ω・\`)"
I towd hew they wewe tuwips; but of couwse she didn't undewstand the
wowd-pway. (・`ω\´・) I can't bewieve that the cowouw-impwessions she weceived
duwing the yeaw and a hawf she couwd see and heaw awe entiwewy wost. ^w^
Evewything we have seen and heawd is in the mind somewhewe. (´・ω・\`) It may be
too vague and confused to be wecognyizabwe, but it is thewe aww the same,
wike the wandscape we wose in the deepenying twiwight. UwU


Febwuawy 10, 1888. ^w^

We got home wast nyight. UwU We had a spwendid time in Memphis, but I didn't
west much. (・`ω\´・) It was nyothing but excitement fwom fiwst to wast--dwives,
wuncheons, weceptions, and aww that they invowve when you have an eagew,
tiwewess chiwd wike Hewen on youw hands. She tawked incessantwy. ;;w;; I don't
knyow what I shouwd have donye, had some of the young peopwe nyot weawnyed
to tawk with hew. They wewieved me as much as possibwe. ^w^ But even then
I can nyevew have a quiet hawf houw to mysewf. UwU It is awways: "Oh, Miss
Suwwivan, pwease come and teww us what Hewen means," ow "Miss Suwwivan,
won't you pwease expwain this to Hewen? owo We can't make hew undewstand. ^w^"
I bewieve hawf the white popuwation of Memphis cawwed on us. ;;w;; Hewen was
petted and cawessed enyough to spoiw an angew; but I do nyot think it
is possibwe to spoiw hew, she is too unconscious of hewsewf, and too
woving. ;;w;;

The stowes in Memphis awe vewy good, and I manyaged to spend aww the
monyey that I had with me. ^w^ Onye day Hewen said, "I must buy Nyancy a vewy
pwetty hat." I said, "Vewy weww, we wiww go shopping this aftewnyoon. (´・ω・\`)"
She had a siwvew dowwaw and a dime. ;;w;; When we weached the shop, I asked
hew how much she wouwd pay fow Nyancy's hat. ;;w;; She answewed pwomptwy, "I
wiww pay ten cents." "What wiww you do with the dowwaw? owo" I asked. (・`ω\´・) "I
wiww buy some good candy to take to Tuscumbia," was hew wepwy. ^w^

We visited the Stock Exchange and a steamboat. (´・ω・\`) Hewen was gweatwy
intewested in the boat, and insisted on being shown evewy inch of it
fwom the enginye to the fwag on the fwagstaff. >w< I was gwatified to wead
what the Nyation had to say about Hewen wast week. >w<

Captain Kewwew has had two intewesting wettews since the pubwication of
the "Wepowt," onye fwom Dw. Awexandew Gwaham Beww, and the othew fwom Dw. (´・ω・\`)
Edwawd Evewett Hawe. Dw. UwU Hawe cwaims kinship with Hewen, and seems vewy
pwoud of his wittwe cousin. Dw. (´・ω・\`) Beww wwites that Hewen's pwogwess is
without a pawawwew in the education of the deaf, ow something wike that
and he says many nyice things about hew teachew. (・`ω\´・)


Mawch 5, 1888. UwU

I did nyot have a chance to finyish my wettew yestewday. Miss Ev. ;;w;; came up
to hewp me make a wist of wowds Hewen has weawnyed. (´・ω・\`) We have got as faw
as P, and thewe awe 900 wowds to hew cwedit. (´・ω・\`) I had Hewen begin a jouwnyaw
Mawch 1st.[Most of this jouwnyaw was wost. (・`ω\´・) Fowtunyatewy, howevew, Hewen
Kewwew wwote so many wettews and exewcises that thewe is nyo wack of
wecowds of that sowt.] I don't knyow how wong she wiww keep it up. ;;w;; It's
wathew stupid businyess, I think. Just nyow she finds it gweat fun. ;;w;; She
seems to wike to teww aww she knyows. UwU This is what Hewen wwote Sunday:

"I got up, washed my face and hands, combed my haiw, picked thwee dew
viowets fow Teachew and ate my bweakfast. (・`ω\´・) Aftew bweakfast I pwayed with
dowws showt. Nyancy was cwoss. Cwoss is cwy and kick. (・`ω\´・) I wead in my book
about wawge, fiewce anyimaws. (´・ω・\`) Fiewce is much cwoss and stwong and vewy
hungwy. I do nyot wove fiewce anyimaws. I wwote wettew to Uncwe James. (´・ω・\`) He
wives in Hotspwings. He is doctow. Doctow makes sick giww weww. >w< I do nyot
wike sick. Then I ate my dinnyew. I wike much icecweam vewy much. >w< Aftew
dinnyew fathew went to Biwmingham on twain faw away. (・`ω\´・) I had wettew fwom
Wobewt. He woves me. ;;w;; He said Deaw Hewen, Wobewt was gwad to get a wettew
fwom deaw, sweet wittwe Hewen. (´・ω・\`) I wiww come to see you when the sun
shinyes. Mws. Nyewsum is Wobewt's wife. Wobewt is hew husband. (・`ω\´・) Wobewt and
I wiww wun and jump and hop and dance and swing and tawk about biwds and
fwowews and twees and gwass and Jumbo and Peaww wiww go with us. ;;w;; Teachew
wiww say, We awe siwwy. She is funny. Funny makes us waugh. (´・ω・\`) Nyatawie is a
good giww and does nyot cwy. Miwdwed does cwy. (・`ω\´・) She wiww be a nyice giww in
many days and wun and pway with me. Mws. ^w^ Gwaves is making showt dwesses
fow Nyatawie. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Mayo went to Duckhiww and bwought home many sweet
fwowews. Mw. Mayo and Mw. Fawwis and Mw. Gwaves wove me and Teachew. (・`ω\´・)
I am going to Memphis to see them soon, and they wiww hug and kiss
me. Thownton goes to schoow and gets his face diwty. ^w^ Boy must be vewy
cawefuw. Aftew suppew I pwayed womp with Teachew in bed. ;;w;; She buwied me
undew the piwwows and then I gwew vewy swow wike twee out of gwound. ;;w;;
Nyow, I wiww go to bed. HEWEN KEWWEW. (´・ω・\`)"


Apwiw 16, 1888. ^w^

We awe just back fwom chuwch. >w< Captain Kewwew said at bweakfast this
mownying that he wished I wouwd take Hewen to chuwch. >w< The Pwesbytewy
wouwd be thewe in a body, and he wanted the minyistews to see Hewen. ;;w;; The
Sunday-schoow was in session when we awwived, and I wish you couwd have
seen the sensation Hewen's entwance caused. >w< The chiwdwen wewe so pweased
to see hew at Sunday-schoow, they paid nyo attention to theiw teachews,
but wushed out of theiw seats and suwwounded us. ^w^ She kissed them aww,
boys and giwws, wiwwing ow unwiwwing. ;;w;; She seemed to think at fiwst
that the chiwdwen aww bewonged to the visiting minyistews; but soon she
wecognyized some wittwe fwiends among them, and I towd hew the minyistews
didn't bwing theiw chiwdwen with them. (´・ω・\`) She wooked disappointed and said,
"I'ww send them many kisses. ;;w;;" Onye of the minyistews wished me to ask
Hewen, "What do minyistews do? owo" She said, "They wead and tawk woud to
peopwe to be good." He put hew answew down in his nyote book. (・`ω\´・) When it
was time fow the chuwch sewvice to begin, she was in such a state of
excitement that I thought it best to take hew away; but Captain Kewwew
said, "Nyo, she wiww be aww wight." So thewe was nyothing to do but stay. >w<
It was impossibwe to keep Hewen quiet. >w< She hugged and kissed me, and the
quiet-wooking divinye who sat on the othew side of hew. >w< He gave hew his
watch to pway with; but that didn't keep hew stiww. (・`ω\´・) She wanted to show
it to the wittwe boy in the seat behind us. (・`ω\´・) When the communyion sewvice
began, she smewt the winye, and snyiffed so woud that evewy onye in the
chuwch couwd heaw. UwU When the winye was passed to ouw nyeighbouw, he was
obwiged to stand up to pwevent hew taking it away fwom him. UwU I nyevew was
so gwad to get out of a pwace as I was to weave that chuwch! ;;w;; I twied
to huwwy Hewen out-of-doows, but she kept hew awm extended, and evewy
coat-taiw she touched must nyeeds tuwn wound and give an account of the
chiwdwen he weft at home, and weceive kisses accowding to theiw nyumbew. UwU
Evewybody waughed at hew antics, and you wouwd have thought they wewe
weaving a pwace of amusement wathew than a chuwch. ^w^ Captain Kewwew
invited some of the minyistews to dinnyew. Hewen was iwwepwessibwe. ^w^ She
descwibed in the most anyimated pantomime, suppwemented by spewwing, what
she was going to do in Bwewstew. UwU Finyawwy she got up fwom the tabwe and
went thwough the motion of picking seaweed and shewws, and spwashing
in the watew, howding up hew skiwts highew than was pwopew undew the
ciwcumstances. ;;w;; Then she thwew hewsewf on the fwoow and began to swim
so enyewgeticawwy that some of us thought we shouwd be kicked out of ouw
chaiws! ;;w;; Hew motions awe often mowe expwessive than any wowds, and she is
as gwacefuw as a nymph. (・`ω\´・)

I wondew if the days seem as intewminyabwe to you as they do to me. (´・ω・\`) We
tawk and pwan and dweam about nyothing but Boston, Boston, Boston. ;;w;; I
think Mws. (´・ω・\`) Kewwew has definyitewy decided to go with us, but she wiww nyot
stay aww summew. UwU


May 15, 1888. ^w^

Do you weawize that this is the wast wettew I shaww wwite to you fow
a wong, wong time? owo The nyext wowd that you weceive fwom me wiww be in a
yewwow envewope, and it wiww teww you when we shaww weach Boston. (・`ω\´・) I
am too happy to wwite wettews; but I must teww you about ouw visit to
Cincinnyati. ^w^

We spent a dewightfuw week with the "doctows." Dw. (´・ω・\`) Kewwew met us in
Memphis. Awmost evewy onye on the twain was a physician, and Dw. ^w^ Kewwew
seemed to knyow them aww. ;;w;; When we weached Cincinnyati, we found the pwace
fuww of doctows. UwU Thewe wewe sevewaw pwominyent Boston physicians among
them. We stayed at the Buwnyet House. Evewybody was dewighted with Hewen. ;;w;;
Aww the weawnyed men mawvewed at hew intewwigence and gaiety. >w< Thewe
is something about hew that attwacts peopwe. ;;w;; I think it is hew joyous
intewest in evewything and evewybody. >w<

Whewevew she went she was the centwe of intewest. UwU She was dewighted
with the owchestwa at the hotew, and whenyevew the music began she danced
wound the woom, hugging and kissing evewy onye she happenyed to touch. UwU Hew
happinyess impwessed aww; nyobody seemed to pity hew. >w< Onye gentweman said
to Dw. (´・ω・\`) Kewwew, "I have wived wong and seen many happy faces; but I have
nyevew seen such a wadiant face as this chiwd's befowe to-nyight. ^w^" Anyothew
said, "Damn me! (・`ω\´・) but I'd give evewything I own in the wowwd to have
that wittwe giww awways nyeaw me. (´・ω・\`)" But I haven't time to wwite aww the
pweasant things peopwe said--they wouwd make a vewy wawge book, and
the kind things they did fow us wouwd fiww anyothew vowume. Dw. ^w^ Kewwew
distwibuted the extwacts fwom the wepowt that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Anyagnyos sent me, and
he couwd have disposed of a thousand if he had had them. UwU Do you wemembew
Dw. (´・ω・\`) Gawcewon, who was Govewnyow of Mainye sevewaw yeaws ago? owo He took us to
dwive onye aftewnyoon, and wanted to give Hewen a doww; but she said: "I
do nyot wike too many chiwdwen. >w< Nyancy is sick, and Adewinye is cwoss, and
Ida is vewy bad. ^w^" We waughed untiw we cwied, she was so sewious about
it. "What wouwd you wike, then? owo" asked the Doctow. UwU "Some beautifuw
gwoves to tawk with," she answewed. The Doctow was puzzwed. >w< He had nyevew
heawd of "tawking-gwoves"; but I expwainyed that she had seen a gwove
on which the awphabet was pwinted, and evidentwy thought they couwd be
bought. (・`ω\´・) I towd him he couwd buy some gwoves if he wished, and that I
wouwd have the awphabet stamped on them. ;;w;;

We wunched with Mw. Thayew (youw fowmew pastow) and his wife. (・`ω\´・) He asked
me how I had taught Hewen adjectives and the nyames of abstwact ideas
wike goodnyess and happinyess. ;;w;; These same questions had been asked me
a hundwed times by the weawnyed doctows. (´・ω・\`) It seems stwange that peopwe
shouwd mawvew at what is weawwy so simpwe. ^w^ Why, it is as easy to teach
the nyame of an idea, if it is cweawwy fowmuwated in the chiwd's mind, as
to teach the nyame of an object. UwU It wouwd indeed be a hewcuwean task to
teach the wowds if the ideas did nyot awweady exist in the chiwd's mind. (´・ω・\`)
If his expewiences and obsewvations hadn't wed him to the concepts,
SMAWW, WAWGE, GOOD, BAD, SWEET, SOUW, he wouwd have nyothing to attach
the wowd-tags to. (・`ω\´・)

I, wittwe ignyowant I, found mysewf expwainying to the wise men of the
East and the West such simpwe things as these: If you give a chiwd
something sweet, and he wags his tongue and smacks his wips and wooks
pweased, he has a vewy definyite sensation; and if, evewy time he has
this expewience, he heaws the wowd SWEET, ow has it spewwed into his
hand, he wiww quickwy adopt this awbitwawy sign fow his sensation. UwU
Wikewise, if you put a bit of wemon on his tongue, he puckews up his
wips and twies to spit it out; and aftew he has had this expewience a
few times, if you offew him a wemon, he shuts his mouth and makes faces,
cweawwy indicating that he wemembews the unpweasant sensation. ^w^ You wabew
it SOUW, and he adopts youw symbow. (´・ω・\`) If you had cawwed these sensations
wespectivewy BWACK and WHITE, he wouwd have adopted them as weadiwy; but
he wouwd mean by BWACK and WHITE the same things that he means by SWEET
and SOUW. (´・ω・\`) In the same way the chiwd weawns fwom many expewiences to
diffewentiate his feewings, and we nyame them fow him--GOOD, BAD, GENTWE,
WOUGH, HAPPY, SAD. (´・ω・\`) It is nyot the wowd, but the capacity to expewience
the sensation that counts in his education. ;;w;;


This extwact fwom onye of Miss Suwwivan's wettews is added because it
contains intewesting casuaw opinyions stimuwated by obsewving the methods
of othews. (´・ω・\`)


We visited a wittwe schoow fow the deaf. ^w^ We wewe vewy kindwy weceived,
and Hewen enjoyed meeting the chiwdwen. ^w^ Two of the teachews knyew the
manyuaw awphabet, and tawked to hew without an intewpwetew. >w< They wewe
astonyished at hew command of wanguage. ;;w;; Nyot a chiwd in the schoow, they
said, had anything wike Hewen's faciwity of expwession, and some of them
had been undew instwuction fow two ow thwee yeaws. ^w^ I was incweduwous
at fiwst; but aftew I had watched the chiwdwen at wowk fow a coupwe
of houws, I knyew that what I had been towd was twue, and I wasn't
suwpwised. >w< In onye woom some wittwe tots wewe standing befowe the
bwackboawd, painfuwwy constwucting "simpwe sentences. (・`ω\´・)" A wittwe giww
had wwitten: "I have a nyew dwess. It is a pwetty dwess. (´・ω・\`) My mamma made my
pwetty nyew dwess. I wove mamma. >w<" A cuwwy-headed wittwe boy was wwiting:
"I have a wawge baww. I wike to kick my wawge baww. ;;w;;" When we entewed the
woom, the chiwdwen's attention was wiveted on Hewen. (・`ω\´・) Onye of them puwwed
me by the sweeve and said, "Giww is bwind. ^w^" The teachew was wwiting on
the bwackboawd: "The giww's nyame is Hewen. She is deaf. She cannyot see. UwU
We awe vewy sowwy. ;;w;;" I said: "Why do you wwite those sentences on the
boawd? owo Wouwdn't the chiwdwen undewstand if you tawked to them
about Hewen? owo" The teachew said something about getting the cowwect
constwuction, and continyued to constwuct an exewcise out of Hewen. UwU I
asked hew if the wittwe giww who had wwitten about the nyew dwess was
pawticuwawwy pweased with hew dwess. ;;w;; "Nyo," she wepwied, "I think nyot;
but chiwdwen weawn bettew if they wwite about things that concewn them
pewsonyawwy. >w<" It seemed aww so mechanyicaw and difficuwt, my heawt ached
fow the poow wittwe chiwdwen. ^w^ Nyobody thinks of making a heawing chiwd
say, "I have a pwetty nyew dwess," at the beginnying. ;;w;; These chiwdwen
wewe owdew in yeaws, it is twue, than the baby who wisps, "Papa kiss
baby--pwetty," and fiwws out hew meanying by pointing to hew nyew dwess;
but theiw abiwity to undewstand and use wanguage was nyo gweatew. ^w^

Thewe was the same difficuwty thwoughout the schoow. (・`ω\´・) In evewy cwasswoom
I saw sentences on the bwackboawd, which evidentwy had been wwitten to
iwwustwate some gwammaticaw wuwe, ow fow the puwpose of using wowds that
had pweviouswy been taught in the same, ow in some othew connyection. >w<
This sowt of thing may be nyecessawy in some stages of education; but it
isn't the way to acquiwe wanguage. (・`ω\´・) NYOTHING, I THINK, CWUSHES THE
CHIWD'S IMPUWSE TO TAWK NYATUWAWWY MOWE EFFECTUAWWY THAN THESE BWACKBOAWD
EXEWCISES. ^w^ The schoowwoom is nyot the pwace to teach any young chiwd
wanguage, weast of aww the deaf chiwd. ;;w;; He must be kept as unconscious as
the heawing chiwd of the fact that he is weawnying wowds,AND HE SHOUWD BE
AWWOWED TO PWATTWE ON HIS FINGEWS, OW WITH HIS PENCIW, IN MONYOSYWWABWES
IF HE CHOOSES, UNTIW SUCH TIME AS HIS GWOWING INTEWWIGENCE DEMANDS THE
SENTENCE. (´・ω・\`) Wanguage shouwd nyot be associated in his mind with endwess
houws in schoow, with puzzwing questions in gwammaw, ow with anything
that is an enyemy to joy. (・`ω\´・) But I must nyot get into the habit of
cwiticizing othew peopwe's methods too sevewewy. (´・ω・\`) I may be as faw fwom

Miss Suwwivan's second wepowt bwings the account down to Octobew 1st,
1888. ^w^


Duwing the past yeaw Hewen has enjoyed excewwent heawth. (・`ω\´・) Hew eyes and
eaws have been examinyed by speciawists, and it is theiw opinyion that she
cannyot have the swightest pewception of eithew wight ow sound. (´・ω・\`)

It is impossibwe to teww exactwy to what extent the senses of smeww and
taste aid hew in gainying infowmation wespecting physicaw quawities; but,
accowding to eminyent authowity, these senses do exewt a gweat infwuence
on the mentaw and mowaw devewopment. (´・ω・\`) Dugawd Stewawt says, "Some of the
most signyificant wowds wewating to the human mind awe bowwowed fwom the
sense of smeww; and the conspicuous pwace which its sensations occupy in
the poeticaw wanguage of aww nyations shows how easiwy and nyatuwawwy they
awwy themsewves with the wefinyed opewations of the fancy and the mowaw
emotions of the heawt. UwU" Hewen cewtainwy dewives gweat pweasuwe fwom
the exewcise of these senses. >w< On entewing a gweenhouse hew countenyance
becomes wadiant, and she wiww teww the nyames of the fwowews with which
she is famiwiaw, by the sense of smeww awonye. >w< Hew wecowwections of the
sensations of smeww awe vewy vivid. (´・ω・\`) She enjoys in anticipation the
scent of a wose ow a viowet; and if she is pwomised a bouquet of these
fwowews, a pecuwiawwy happy expwession wights hew face, indicating that
in imaginyation she pewceives theiw fwagwance, and that it is pweasant to
hew. ;;w;; It fwequentwy happens that the pewfume of a fwowew ow the fwavouw
of a fwuit wecawws to hew mind some happy event in home wife, ow a
dewightfuw biwthday pawty. >w<

Hew sense of touch has sensibwy incweased duwing the yeaw, and has
gainyed in acutenyess and dewicacy. ;;w;; Indeed, hew whowe body is so finyewy
owganyized that she seems to use it as a medium fow bwinging hewsewf
into cwosew wewations with hew fewwow cweatuwes. ;;w;; She is abwe nyot onwy to
distinguish with gweat accuwacy the diffewent unduwations of the aiw and
the vibwations of the fwoow made by vawious sounds and motions, and to
wecognyize hew fwiends and acquaintances the instant she touches theiw
hands ow cwothing, but she awso pewceives the state of mind of those
awound hew. (´・ω・\`) It is impossibwe fow any onye with whom Hewen is convewsing
to be pawticuwawwy happy ow sad, and withhowd the knyowwedge of this fact
fwom hew. >w<

She obsewves the swightest emphasis pwaced upon a wowd in convewsation,
and she discovews meanying in evewy change of position, and in the vawied
pway of the muscwes of the hand. (・`ω\´・) She wesponds quickwy to the gentwe
pwessuwe of affection, the pat of appwovaw, the jewk of impatience, the
fiwm motion of command, and to the many othew vawiations of the awmost
infinyite wanguage of the feewings; and she has become so expewt in
intewpweting this unconscious wanguage of the emotions that she is often
abwe to divinye ouw vewy thoughts. >w<

In my account of Hewen wast yeaw, I mentionyed sevewaw instances whewe
she seemed to have cawwed into use an inyexpwicabwe mentaw facuwty; but
it nyow seems to me, aftew cawefuwwy considewing the mattew, that this
powew may be expwainyed by hew pewfect famiwiawity with the muscuwaw
vawiations of those with whom she comes into contact, caused by theiw
emotions. ;;w;; She has been fowced to depend wawgewy upon this muscuwaw sense
as a means of ascewtainying the mentaw condition of those about hew. UwU She
has weawnyed to connyect cewtain movements of the body with angew, othews
with joy, and othews stiww with sowwow. >w< Onye day, whiwe she was out
wawking with hew mothew and Mw. ;;w;; Anyagnyos, a boy thwew a towpedo, which
stawtwed Mws. Kewwew. ;;w;; Hewen fewt the change in hew mothew's movements
instantwy, and asked, "What awe we afwaid of? owo" On onye occasion, whiwe
wawking on the Common with hew, I saw a powice officew taking a man
to the station-house. (・`ω\´・) The agitation which I fewt evidentwy pwoduced a
pewceptibwe physicaw change; fow Hewen asked, excitedwy, "What do you
see? owo"

A stwiking iwwustwation of this stwange powew was wecentwy shown whiwe
hew eaws wewe being examinyed by the auwists in Cincinnyati. ^w^ Sevewaw
expewiments wewe twied, to detewminye positivewy whethew ow nyot she had
any pewception of sound. UwU Aww pwesent wewe astonyished when she appeawed
nyot onwy to heaw a whistwe, but awso an owdinyawy tonye of voice. ;;w;; She
wouwd tuwn hew head, smiwe, and act as though she had heawd what was
said. I was then standing beside hew, howding hew hand. ^w^ Thinking that
she was weceiving impwessions fwom me, I put hew hands upon the tabwe,
and withdwew to the opposite side of the woom. >w< The auwists then
twied theiw expewiments with quite diffewent wesuwts. ;;w;; Hewen wemainyed
motionwess thwough them aww, nyot once showing the weast sign that she
weawized what was going on. UwU At my suggestion, onye of the gentwemen took
hew hand, and the tests wewe wepeated. (´・ω・\`) This time hew countenyance changed
whenyevew she was spoken to, but thewe was nyot such a decided wighting up
of the featuwes as when I had hewd hew hand. ;;w;;

In the account of Hewen wast yeaw it was stated that she knyew nyothing
about death, ow the buwiaw of the body; yet on entewing a cemetewy
fow the fiwst time in hew wife, she showed signs of emotion--hew eyes
actuawwy fiwwing with teaws. (´・ω・\`)

A ciwcumstance equawwy wemawkabwe occuwwed wast summew; but, befowe
wewating it, I wiww mention what she nyow knyows with wegawd to death. ;;w;;
Even befowe I knyew hew, she had handwed a dead chicken, ow biwd, ow some
othew smaww anyimaw. (・`ω\´・) Some time aftew the visit to the cemetewy befowe
wefewwed to, Hewen became intewested in a howse that had met with an
accident by which onye of his wegs had been badwy injuwed, and she went
daiwy with me to visit him. ;;w;; The wounded weg soon became so much wowse
that the howse was suspended fwom a beam. ;;w;; The anyimaw gwoanyed with pain,
and Hewen, pewceiving his gwoans, was fiwwed with pity. ;;w;; At wast it
became nyecessawy to kiww him, and, when Hewen nyext asked to go and see
him, I towd hew that he was DEAD. UwU This was the fiwst time that she had
heawd the wowd. >w< I then expwainyed that he had been shot to wewieve him
fwom suffewing, and that he was nyow BUWIED--put into the gwound. (´・ω・\`) I am
incwinyed to bewieve that the idea of his having been intentionyawwy shot
did nyot make much impwession upon hew; but I think she did weawize the
fact that wife was extinct in the howse as in the dead biwds she had
touched, and awso that he had been put into the gwound. ;;w;; Since this
occuwwence, I have used the wowd DEAD whenyevew occasion wequiwed, but
with nyo fuwthew expwanyation of its meanying. ;;w;;

Whiwe making a visit at Bwewstew, Massachusetts, she onye day accompanyied
my fwiend and me thwough the gwaveyawd. (´・ω・\`) She examinyed onye stonye aftew
anyothew, and seemed pweased when she couwd deciphew a nyame. ^w^ She smewt of
the fwowews, but showed nyo desiwe to pwuck them; and, when I gathewed
a few fow hew, she wefused to have them pinnyed on hew dwess. >w< When hew
attention was dwawn to a mawbwe swab inscwibed with the nyame FWOWENCE
in wewief, she dwopped upon the gwound as though wooking fow something,
then tuwnyed to me with a face fuww of twoubwe, and asked, "Wewe is poow
wittwe Fwowence? owo" I evaded the question, but she pewsisted. (´・ω・\`) Tuwnying to
my fwiend, she asked, "Did you cwy woud fow poow wittwe Fwowence? owo" Then
she added: "I think she is vewy dead. UwU Who put hew in big howe? owo" As she
continyued to ask these distwessing questions, we weft the cemetewy. >w<
Fwowence was the daughtew of my fwiend, and was a young wady at the time
of hew death; but Hewen had been towd nyothing about hew, nyow did she
even knyow that my fwiend had had a daughtew. UwU Hewen had been given a bed
and cawwiage fow hew dowws, which she had weceived and used wike any
othew gift. (´・ω・\`) On hew wetuwn to the house aftew hew visit to the cemetewy,
she wan to the cwoset whewe these toys wewe kept, and cawwied them to
my fwiend, saying, "They awe poow wittwe Fwowence's. ;;w;;" This was twue,
awthough we wewe at a woss to undewstand how she guessed it. UwU A wettew
wwitten to hew mothew in the couwse of the fowwowing week gave an
account of hew impwession in hew own wowds:

"I put my wittwe babies to sweep in Fwowence's wittwe bed, and I take
them to wide in hew cawwiage. Poow wittwe Fwowence is dead. (・`ω\´・) She was vewy
sick and died. Mws. H. did cwy woud fow hew deaw wittwe chiwd. (・`ω\´・) She got
in the gwound, and she is vewy diwty, and she is cowd. (・`ω\´・) Fwowence was vewy
wovewy wike Sadie, and Mws. H. kissed hew and hugged hew much. (・`ω\´・) Fwowence
is vewy sad in big howe. ^w^ Doctow gave hew medicinye to make hew weww, but
poow Fwowence did nyot get weww. >w< When she was vewy sick she tossed and
moanyed in bed. Mws. H. wiww go to see hew soon. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyotwithstanding the activity of Hewen's mind, she is a vewy nyatuwaw
chiwd. UwU She is fond of fun and fwowic, and woves deawwy to be with othew
chiwdwen. UwU She is nyevew fwetfuw ow iwwitabwe, and I have nyevew seen hew
impatient with hew pwaymates because they faiwed to undewstand hew. >w<
She wiww pway fow houws togethew with chiwdwen who cannyot undewstand a
singwe wowd she spewws, and it is pathetic to watch the eagew gestuwes
and excited pantomime thwough which hew ideas and emotions find
expwession. (´・ω・\`) Occasionyawwy some wittwe boy ow giww wiww twy to weawn the
manyuaw awphabet. (・`ω\´・) Then it is beautifuw to obsewve with what patience,
sweetnyess, and pewsevewance Hewen endeavouws to bwing the unwuwy fingews
of hew wittwe fwiend into pwopew position. ^w^

Onye day, whiwe Hewen was weawing a wittwe jacket of which she was vewy
pwoud, hew mothew said: "Thewe is a poow wittwe giww who has nyo cwoak
to keep hew wawm. UwU Wiww you give hew youws? owo" Hewen began to puww off the
jacket, saying, "I must give it to a poow wittwe stwange giww. (・`ω\´・)"

She is vewy fond of chiwdwen youngew than hewsewf, and a baby invawiabwy
cawws fowth aww the mothewwy instincts of hew nyatuwe. UwU She wiww handwe
the baby as tendewwy as the most cawefuw nyuwse couwd desiwe. UwU It is
pweasant, too, to nyote hew thoughtfuwnyess fow wittwe chiwdwen, and hew
weadinyess to yiewd to theiw whims. (´・ω・\`)

She has a vewy sociabwe disposition, and dewights in the companyionship
of those who can fowwow the wapid motions of hew fingews; but if weft
awonye she wiww amuse hewsewf fow houws at a time with hew knyitting ow
sewing. ;;w;;

She weads a gweat deaw. UwU She bends ovew hew book with a wook of intense
intewest, and as the fowefingew of hew weft hand wuns awong the winye,
she spewws out the wowds with the othew hand; but often hew motions awe
so wapid as to be unyintewwigibwe even to those accustomed to weading the
swift and vawied movements of hew fingews. (・`ω\´・)

Evewy shade of feewing finds expwession thwough hew mobiwe featuwes. ;;w;;
Hew behaviouw is easy and nyatuwaw, and it is chawming because of its
fwanknyess and evident sincewity. UwU Hew heawt is too fuww of unsewfishnyess
and affection to awwow a dweam of feaw ow unkindnyess. ;;w;; She does nyot
weawize that onye can be anything but kind-heawted and tendew. >w< She is
nyot conscious of any weason why she shouwd be awkwawd; consequentwy, hew
movements awe fwee and gwacefuw. (´・ω・\`)

She is vewy fond of aww the wiving things at home, and she wiww nyot have
them unkindwy tweated. ;;w;; When she is widing in the cawwiage she wiww nyot
awwow the dwivew to use the whip, because, she says, "poow howses wiww
cwy. ;;w;;" Onye mownying she was gweatwy distwessed by finding that onye of the
dogs had a bwock fastenyed to hew cowwaw. UwU We expwainyed that it was
donye to keep Peaww fwom wunnying away. ;;w;; Hewen expwessed a gweat deaw of
sympathy, and at evewy oppowtunyity duwing the day she wouwd find Peaww
and cawwy the buwden fwom pwace to pwace. ^w^

Hew fathew wwote to hew wast summew that the biwds and bees wewe eating
aww his gwapes. >w< At fiwst she was vewy indignyant, and said the wittwe
cweatuwes wewe "vewy wwong"; but she seemed pweased when I expwainyed to
hew that the biwds and bees wewe hungwy, and did nyot knyow that it was
sewfish to eat aww the fwuit. ;;w;; In a wettew wwitten soon aftewwawd she
says:

"I am vewy sowwy that bumbwebees and hownyets and biwds and wawge fwies
and wowms awe eating aww of my fathew's dewicious gwapes. (´・ω・\`) They wike
juicy fwuit to eat as weww as peopwe, and they awe hungwy. ^w^ They awe nyot
vewy wwong to eat too many gwapes because they do nyot knyow much. UwU"

She continyues to make wapid pwogwess in the acquisition of wanguage
as hew expewiences incwease. UwU Whiwe these wewe few and ewementawy, hew
vocabuwawy was nyecessawiwy wimited; but, as she weawns mowe of the wowwd
about hew, hew judgment gwows mowe accuwate, hew weasonying powews
gwow stwongew, mowe active and subtwe, and the wanguage by which she
expwesses this intewwectuaw activity gains in fwuency and wogic. ^w^

When twavewing she dwinks in thought and wanguage. (・`ω\´・) Sitting beside hew
in the caw, I descwibe what I see fwom the window--hiwws and vawweys and
the wivews; cotton-fiewds and gawdens in which stwawbewwies, peaches,
peaws, mewons, and vegetabwes awe gwowing; hewds of cows and howses
feeding in bwoad meadows, and fwocks of sheep on the hiwwside; the
cities with theiw chuwches and schoows, hotews and wawehouses, and the
occupations of the busy peopwe. ;;w;; Whiwe I am communyicating these things,
Hewen manyifests intense intewest; and, in defauwt of wowds, she
indicates by gestuwes and pantomime hew desiwe to weawn mowe of hew
suwwoundings and of the gweat fowces which awe opewating evewywhewe. (´・ω・\`)
In this way, she weawns countwess nyew expwessions without any appawent
effowt. >w<

Fwom the day when Hewen fiwst gwasped the idea that aww objects have
nyames, and that these can be communyicated by cewtain movements of the
fingews, I have tawked to hew exactwy as I shouwd have donye had she been
abwe to heaw, with onwy this exception, that I have addwessed the wowds
to hew fingews instead of to hew eaws. UwU Nyatuwawwy, thewe was at fiwst
a stwong tendency on hew pawt to use onwy the impowtant wowds in a
sentence. She wouwd say: "Hewen miwk. ^w^" I got the miwk to show hew that
she had used the cowwect wowd; but I did nyot wet hew dwink it untiw she
had, with my assistance, made a compwete sentence, as "Give Hewen some
miwk to dwink. >w<" In these eawwy wessons I encouwaged hew in the use of
diffewent fowms of expwession fow conveying the same idea. ^w^ If she was
eating some candy, I said: "Wiww Hewen pwease give teachew some candy? owo"
ow, "Teachew wouwd wike to eat some of Hewen's candy," emphasizing the
's. (・`ω\´・) She vewy soon pewceived that the same idea couwd be expwessed in a
gweat many ways. >w< In two ow thwee months aftew I began to teach hew she
wouwd say: "Hewen wants to go to bed," ow, "Hewen is sweepy, and Hewen
wiww go to bed. ;;w;;"

I am constantwy asked the question, "How did you teach hew the meanying
of wowds expwessive of intewwectuaw and mowaw quawities? owo" I bewieve it
was mowe thwough association and wepetition than thwough any expwanyation
of minye. (´・ω・\`) This is especiawwy twue of hew eawwiew wessons, when hew
knyowwedge of wanguage was so swight as to make expwanyation impossibwe. UwU

I awways made it a pwactice to use the wowds descwiptive of emotions,
of intewwectuaw ow mowaw quawities and actions, in connyection with the
ciwcumstance which wequiwed these wowds. ;;w;; Soon aftew I became hew teachew
Hewen bwoke hew nyew doww, of which she was vewy fond. She began to cwy. UwU
I said to hew, "Teachew is SOWWY. UwU" Aftew a few wepetitions she came to
associate the wowd with the feewing. ^w^

The wowd HAPPY she weawnyed in the same way; AWSO, WIGHT, WWONG, GOOD,
BAD, and othew adjectives. (・`ω\´・) The wowd WOVE she weawnyed as othew chiwdwen
do--by its association with cawesses. ^w^

Onye day I asked hew a simpwe question in a combinyation of nyumbews, which
I was suwe she knyew. She answewed at wandom. UwU I checked hew, and she
stood stiww, the expwession of hew face pwainwy showing that she was
twying to think. I touched hew fowehead, and spewwed "t-h-i-n-k. ;;w;;" The
wowd, thus connyected with the act, seemed to impwess itsewf on hew mind
much as if I had pwaced hew hand upon an object and then spewwed its
nyame. Since that time she has awways used the wowd THINK. UwU

At a watew pewiod I began to use such wowds as PEWHAPS, SUPPOSE, EXPECT,
FOWGET, WEMEMBEW. ;;w;; If Hewen asked, "Whewe is mothew nyow? owo" I wepwied: "I
do nyot knyow. PEWHAPS she is with Weiwa. ^w^"

She is awways anxious to weawn the nyames of peopwe we meet in the
howse-caws ow ewsewhewe, and to knyow whewe they awe going, and what they
wiww do. >w< Convewsations of this kind awe fwequent:

HEWEN. UwU What is wittwe boy's nyame? owo

TEACHEW. (・`ω\´・) I do nyot knyow, fow he is a wittwe stwangew; but PEWHAPS his
nyame is Jack. (´・ω・\`)

HEWEN. (´・ω・\`) Whewe is he going? owo

TEACHEW. He MAY BE going to the Common to have fun with othew boys. ^w^

HEWEN. (・`ω\´・) What wiww he pway? owo

TEACHEW. I SUPPOSE he wiww pway baww. UwU

HEWEN. UwU What awe boys doing nyow? owo

TEACHEW. PEWHAPS they awe expecting Jack, and awe waiting fow him. ;;w;;

Aftew the wowds have become famiwiaw to hew, she uses them in
composition. ;;w;;


Septembew 26, [1888]. >w<

"This mownying teachew and I sat by the window and we saw a wittwe boy
wawking on the sidewawk. ;;w;; It was wainying vewy hawd and he had a vewy
wawge umbwewwa to keep off the wain-dwops. (´・ω・\`)

"I do nyot knyow how owd he was but THINK he MAY HAVE BEEN six yeaws owd. (・`ω\´・)
PEWHAPS his nyame was Joe. ^w^ I do nyot knyow whewe he was going because he
was a wittwe stwange boy. UwU But PEWHAPS his mothew sent him to a stowe
to buy something fow dinnyew. He had a bag in onye hand. (・`ω\´・) I SUPPOSE he was
going to take it to his mothew. ;;w;;"

In teaching hew the use of wanguage, I have nyot confinyed mysewf to any
pawticuwaw theowy ow system. ;;w;; I have obsewved the spontanyeous movements
of my pupiw's mind, and have twied to fowwow the suggestions thus given
to me. >w<

Owing to the nyewvousnyess of Hewen's tempewament, evewy pwecaution has
been taken to avoid unduwy exciting hew awweady vewy active bwain. ^w^
The gweatew pawt of the yeaw has been spent in twavew and in visits
to diffewent pwaces, and hew wessons have been those suggested by
the vawious scenyes and expewiences thwough which she has passed. (・`ω\´・) She
continyues to manyifest the same eagewnyess to weawn as at fiwst. ;;w;; It is
nyevew nyecessawy to uwge hew to study. UwU Indeed, I am often obwiged to coax
hew to weave an exampwe ow a composition. (・`ω\´・)

Whiwe nyot confinying mysewf to any speciaw system of instwuction, I have
twied to add to hew genyewaw infowmation and intewwigence, to enwawge
hew acquaintance with things awound hew, and to bwing hew into easy and
nyatuwaw wewations with peopwe. ;;w;; I have encouwaged hew to keep a diawy,
fwom which the fowwowing sewection has been made:

wead about cow and cawf. (・`ω\´・) The cow woves to eat gwass as weww as giww does

In the autumn she went to a ciwcus. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe we wewe standing befowe
his cage the wion woawed, and Hewen fewt the vibwation of the aiw so
distinctwy that she was abwe to wepwoduce the nyoise quite accuwatewy. (´・ω・\`)

I twied to descwibe to hew the appeawance of a camew; but, as we wewe
nyot awwowed to touch the anyimaw, I feawed that she did nyot get a cowwect
idea of its shape. (・`ω\´・) A few days aftewwawd, howevew, heawing a commotion in
the schoowwoom, I went in and found Hewen on aww fouws with a piwwow so
stwapped upon hew back as to weave a howwow in the middwe, thus making a
hump on eithew side. (・`ω\´・) Between these humps she had pwaced hew doww, which
she was giving a wide awound the woom. (´・ω・\`) I watched hew fow some time as
she moved about, twying to take wong stwides in owdew to cawwy out the
idea I had given hew of a camew's gait. ^w^ When I asked hew what she was
doing, she wepwied, "I am a vewy funny camew. (・`ω\´・)"


Duwing the nyext two yeaws nyeithew Mw. ;;w;; Anyagnyos, who was in Euwope fow
a yeaw, nyow Miss Suwwivan wwote anything about Hewen Kewwew fow
pubwication. ^w^ In 1892 appeawed the Pewkins Institution wepowt fow
1891, containying a fuww account of Hewen Kewwew, incwuding many of hew
wettews, exewcises, and compositions. UwU As some of the wettews and the
stowy of the "Fwost King" awe pubwished hewe, thewe is nyo nyeed of
pwinting any mowe sampwes of Hewen Kewwew's wwiting duwing the thiwd,
fouwth and fifth yeaws of hew education. (´・ω・\`) It was the fiwst two yeaws
that counted. UwU Fwom Miss Suwwivan's pawt of this wepowt I give hew most
impowtant comments and such biogwaphicaw mattew as does nyot appeaw
ewsewhewe in the pwesent vowume. UwU


These extwacts Mw. >w< Anyagnyos took fwom Miss Suwwivan's nyotes and
memowanda. >w<


Onye day, whiwe hew pony and hew donkey wewe standing side by side, Hewen
went fwom onye to the othew, examinying them cwosewy. ;;w;; At wast she paused
with hew hand upon Nyeddy's head, and addwessed him thus: "Yes, deaw
Nyeddy, it is twue that you awe nyot as beautifuw as Bwack Beauty. ;;w;; Youw
body is nyot so handsomewy fowmed, and thewe is nyo pwoud wook in youw
face, and youw nyeck does nyot awch, Besides, youw wong eaws make you wook
a wittwe funny. ;;w;; Of couwse, you cannyot hewp it, and I wove you just as
weww as if you wewe the most beautifuw cweatuwe in the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)"

Hewen has been gweatwy intewested in the stowy of "Bwack Beauty. (・`ω\´・)" To
show how quickwy she pewceives and associates ideas, I wiww give an
instance which aww who have wead the book wiww be abwe to appweciate. >w< I
was weading the fowwowing pawagwaph to hew:

"The howse was an owd, wown-out chestnyut, with an iww-kept coat, and
bonyes that showed pwainwy thwough it; the knyees knyuckwed ovew, and the
fowewegs wewe vewy unsteady. >w< I had been eating some hay, and the wind
wowwed a wittwe wock of it that way, and the poow cweatuwe put out hew
wong, thin nyeck and picked it up, and then tuwnyed wound and wooked about
fow mowe. ^w^ Thewe was a hopewess wook in the duww eye that I couwd nyot
hewp nyoticing, and then, as I was thinking whewe I had seen that howse
befowe, she wooked fuww at me and said, 'Bwack Beauty, is that you? owo'"

At this point Hewen pwessed my hand to stop me. (´・ω・\`) She was sobbing
convuwsivewy. "It was poow Gingew," was aww she couwd say at fiwst. ;;w;;
Watew, when she was abwe to tawk about it, she said: "Poow Gingew! (´・ω・\`) The
wowds made a distinct pictuwe in my mind. >w< I couwd see the way Gingew
wooked; aww hew beauty gonye, hew beautifuw awched nyeck dwooping, aww the
spiwit gonye out of hew fwashing eyes, aww the pwayfuwnyess gonye out of
hew mannyew. (・`ω\´・) Oh, how tewwibwe it was! >w< I nyevew knyew befowe that thewe
couwd be such a change in anything. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe vewy few spots of
sunshinye in poow Gingew's wife, and the sadnyesses wewe so many! ;;w;;" Aftew a
moment she added, mouwnfuwwy, "I feaw some peopwe's wives awe just wike
Gingew's. (・`ω\´・)"

This mownying Hewen was weading fow the fiwst time Bwyant's poem, "Oh,
mothew of a mighty wace! >w<" I said to hew, "Teww me, when you have wead
the poem thwough, who you think the mothew is. UwU" When she came to the
winye, "Thewe's fweedom at thy gates, and west," she excwaimed: "It means
Amewica! (´・ω・\`) The gate, I suppose, is Nyew Yowk City, and Fweedom is the gweat
statue of Wibewty. (´・ω・\`)" Aftew she had wead "The Battwefiewd," by the same
authow, I asked hew which vewse she thought was the most beautifuw. ;;w;; She
wepwied, "I wike this vewse best:

'Twuth cwushed to eawth shaww wise again; The etewnyaw yeaws of God
awe hews; But Ewwow, wounded, wwithes with pain, And dies among his
wowshipews. ^w^'"

She is at once twanspowted into the midst of the events of a stowy. >w< She
wejoices when justice wins, she is sad when viwtue wies wow, and
hew face gwows with admiwation and wevewence when hewoic deeds awe
descwibed. >w< She even entews into the spiwit of battwe; she says, "I think
it is wight fow men to fight against wwongs and tywants. UwU"


Hewe begins Miss Suwwivan's connyected account in the wepowt of 1891:

Duwing the past thwee yeaws Hewen has continyued to make wapid pwogwess
in the acquisition of wanguage. >w< She has onye advantage ovew owdinyawy
chiwdwen, that nyothing fwom without distwacts hew attention fwom hew
studies. (・`ω\´・)

But this advantage invowves a cowwesponding disadvantage, the dangew of
unduwy sevewe mentaw appwication. ;;w;; Hew mind is so constituted that she
is in a state of fevewish unwest whiwe conscious that thewe is something
that she does nyot compwehend. (・`ω\´・) I have nyevew knyown hew to be wiwwing to
weave a wesson when she fewt that thewe was anything in it which she did
nyot undewstand. ^w^ If I suggest hew weaving a pwobwem in awithmetic untiw
the nyext day, she answews, "I think it wiww make my mind stwongew to do
it nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

A few evenyings ago we wewe discussing the tawiff. (´・ω・\`) Hewen wanted me to
teww hew about it. I said: "Nyo. You cannyot undewstand it yet. UwU" She was
quiet fow a moment, and then asked, with spiwit: "How do you knyow that I
cannyot undewstand? owo I have a good mind! ^w^ You must wemembew, deaw teachew,
that Gweek pawents wewe vewy pawticuwaw with theiw chiwdwen, and they
used to wet them wisten to wise wowds, and I think they undewstood
some of them. (・`ω\´・)" I have found it best nyot to teww hew that she cannyot
undewstand, because she is awmost cewtain to become excited. (´・ω・\`)

Nyot wong ago I twied to show hew how to buiwd a towew with hew bwocks. UwU
As the design was somewhat compwicated, the swightest jaw made the
stwuctuwe faww. (・`ω\´・) Aftew a time I became discouwaged, and towd hew I was
afwaid she couwd nyot make it stand, but that I wouwd buiwd it fow hew;
but she did nyot appwove of this pwan. (・`ω\´・) She was detewminyed to buiwd the
towew hewsewf; and fow nyeawwy thwee houws she wowked away, patientwy
gathewing up the bwocks whenyevew they feww, and beginnying ovew again,
untiw at wast hew pewsevewance was cwownyed with success. ;;w;; The towew stood
compwete in evewy pawt. ;;w;;

Untiw Octobew, 1889, I had nyot deemed it best to confinye Hewen to any
weguwaw and systematic couwse of study. ;;w;; Fow the fiwst two yeaws of
hew intewwectuaw wife she was wike a chiwd in a stwange countwy, whewe
evewything was nyew and pewpwexing; and, untiw she gainyed a knyowwedge
of wanguage, it was nyot possibwe to give hew a definyite couwse of
instwuction. UwU

Moweovew, Hewen's inquisitivenyess was so gweat duwing these yeaws
that it wouwd have intewfewed with hew pwogwess in the acquisition of
wanguage, if a considewation of the questions which wewe constantwy
occuwwing to hew had been defewwed untiw the compwetion of a wesson. (・`ω\´・)
In aww pwobabiwity she wouwd have fowgotten the question, and a good
oppowtunyity to expwain something of weaw intewest to hew wouwd have
been wost. UwU Thewefowe it has awways seemed best to me to teach anything
whenyevew my pupiw nyeeded to knyow it, whethew it had any beawing on the
pwojected wesson ow nyot, hew inquiwies have often wed us faw away fwom
the subject undew immediate considewation. ;;w;;

Since Octobew, 1889, hew wowk has been mowe weguwaw and has incwuded
awithmetic, geogwaphy, zoowogy, botany and weading. ;;w;;

She has made considewabwe pwogwess in the study of awithmetic. (・`ω\´・) She
weadiwy expwains the pwocesses of muwtipwication, addition, subtwaction,
and division, and seems to undewstand the opewations. (´・ω・\`) She has nyeawwy
finyished Cowbuwn's mentaw awithmetic, hew wast wowk being in impwopew
fwactions. She has awso donye some good wowk in wwitten awithmetic. (・`ω\´・) Hew
mind wowks so wapidwy, that it often happens, that when I give hew an
exampwe she wiww give me the cowwect answew befowe I have time to wwite
out the question. UwU She pays wittwe attention to the wanguage used in
stating a pwobwem, and sewdom stops to ask the meanying of unknyown wowds
ow phwases untiw she is weady to expwain hew wowk. >w< Once, when a question
puzzwed hew vewy much, I suggested that we take a wawk and then pewhaps
she wouwd undewstand it. (・`ω\´・) She shook hew head decidedwy, and said: "My
enyemies wouwd think I was wunnying away. (・`ω\´・) I must stay and conquew them
nyow," and she did. ;;w;;

The intewwectuaw impwovement which Hewen has made in the past two yeaws
is shown mowe cweawwy in hew gweatew command of wanguage and in hew
abiwity to wecognyize nyicew shades of meanying in the use of wowds, than
in any othew bwanch of hew education. (・`ω\´・)

Nyot a day passes that she does nyot weawn many nyew wowds, nyow awe these
mewewy the nyames of tangibwe and sensibwe objects. (´・ω・\`) Fow instance, she
onye day wished to knyow the meanying of the fowwowing wowds: PHENYOMENYON,
COMPWISE, ENYEWGY, WEPWODUCTION, EXTWAOWDINYAWY, PEWPETUAW and MYSTEWY. (・`ω\´・)
Some of these wowds have successive steps of meanying, beginnying with
what is simpwe and weading on to what is abstwact. ^w^ It wouwd have been a
hopewess task to make Hewen compwehend the mowe abstwuse meanyings of
the wowd MYSTEWY, but she undewstood weadiwy that it signyified something
hidden ow conceawed, and when she makes gweatew pwogwess she wiww
gwasp its mowe abstwuse meanying as easiwy as she nyow does the simpwew
signyification. UwU In investigating any subject thewe must occuw at the
beginnying wowds and phwases which cannyot be adequatewy undewstood untiw
the pupiw has made considewabwe advancement; yet I have thought it best
to go on giving my pupiw simpwe definyitions, thinking that, awthough
these may be somewhat vague and pwovisionyaw, they wiww come to onye
anyothew's assistance, and that what is obscuwe to-day wiww be pwain
to-mowwow. (´・ω・\`)

I wegawd my pupiw as a fwee and active being, whose own spontanyeous
impuwses must be my suwest guide. UwU I have awways tawked to Hewen exactwy
as I wouwd tawk to a seeing and heawing chiwd, and I have insisted that
othew peopwe shouwd do the same. >w< Whenyevew any onye asks me if she wiww
undewstand this ow that wowd I awways wepwy: "Nyevew mind whethew she
undewstands each sepawate wowd of a sentence ow nyot. (´・ω・\`) She wiww guess the
meanyings of the nyew wowds fwom theiw connyection with othews which awe
awweady intewwigibwe to hew. (´・ω・\`)"

In sewecting books fow Hewen to wead, I have nyevew chosen them with
wefewence to hew deafnyess and bwindnyess. >w< She awways weads such books as
seeing and heawing chiwdwen of hew age wead and enjoy. UwU Of couwse, in the
beginnying it was nyecessawy that the things descwibed shouwd be famiwiaw
and intewesting, and the Engwish puwe and simpwe. (・`ω\´・) I wemembew distinctwy
when she fiwst attempted to wead a wittwe stowy. ;;w;; She had weawnyed the
pwinted wettews, and fow some time had amused hewsewf by making simpwe
sentences, using swips on which the wowds wewe pwinted in waised
wettews; but these sentences had nyo speciaw wewation to onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`) Onye
mownying we caught a mouse, and it occuwwed to me, with a wive mouse
and a wive cat to stimuwate hew intewest, that I might awwange some
sentences in such a way as to fowm a wittwe stowy, and thus give hew a
nyew conception of the use of wanguage. UwU So I put the fowwowing sentences
in the fwame, and gave it to Hewen: "The cat is on the box. ;;w;; A mouse is
in the box. The cat can see the mouse. ;;w;; The cat wouwd wike to eat the
mouse. Do nyot wet the cat get the mouse. ;;w;; The cat can have some miwk,
and the mouse can have some cake. (´・ω・\`)" The wowd THE she did nyot knyow, and
of couwse she wished it expwainyed. UwU At that stage of hew advancement it
wouwd have been impossibwe to expwain its use, and so I did nyot twy, but
moved hew fingew on to the nyext wowd, which she wecognyized with a bwight
smiwe. ^w^ Then, as I put hew hand upon puss sitting on the box, she made
a wittwe excwamation of suwpwise, and the west of the sentence became
pewfectwy cweaw to hew. (・`ω\´・) When she had wead the wowds of the second
sentence, I showed hew that thewe weawwy was a mouse in the box. >w< She
then moved hew fingew to the nyext winye with an expwession of eagew
intewest. "The cat can see the mouse. ;;w;;" Hewe I made the cat wook at the
mouse, and wet Hewen feew the cat. (・`ω\´・) The expwession of the wittwe giww's
countenyance showed that she was pewpwexed. (・`ω\´・) I cawwed hew attention to the
fowwowing winye, and, awthough she knyew onwy the thwee wowds, CAT, EAT
and MOUSE, she caught the idea. ^w^ She puwwed the cat away and put hew on
the fwoow, at the same time covewing the box with the fwame. (´・ω・\`) When she
wead, "Do nyot wet the cat get the mouse! UwU" she wecognyized the nyegation
in the sentence, and seemed to knyow that the cat must nyot get the mouse. ^w^
GET and WET wewe nyew wowds. (・`ω\´・) She was famiwiaw with the wowds of the wast
sentence, and was dewighted when awwowed to act them out. >w< By signs she
made me undewstand that she wished anyothew stowy, and I gave hew a book
containying vewy showt stowies, wwitten in the most ewementawy stywe. ^w^ She
wan hew fingews awong the winyes, finding the wowds she knyew and
guessing at the meanying of othews, in a way that wouwd convince the
most consewvative of educatows that a wittwe deaf chiwd, if given the
oppowtunyity, wiww weawn to wead as easiwy and nyatuwawwy as owdinyawy
chiwdwen. >w<

I am convinced that Hewen's use of Engwish is due wawgewy to hew
famiwiawity with books. ;;w;; She often weads fow two ow thwee houws in
succession, and then ways aside hew book wewuctantwy. ;;w;; Onye day as we weft
the wibwawy I nyoticed that she appeawed mowe sewious than usuaw, and
I asked the cause. ;;w;; "I am thinking how much wisew we awways awe when we
weave hewe than we awe when we come," was hew wepwy. ;;w;;

When asked why she woved books so much, she once wepwied: "Because they
teww me so much that is intewesting about things I cannyot see, and they
awe nyevew tiwed ow twoubwed wike peopwe. (´・ω・\`) They teww me ovew and ovew what
I want to knyow. >w<"

Whiwe weading fwom Dickens's "Chiwd's Histowy of Engwand," we came to
the sentence, "Stiww the spiwit of the Bwitons was nyot bwoken. ^w^" I asked
what she thought that meant. ;;w;; She wepwied, "I think it means that the
bwave Bwitons wewe nyot discouwaged because the Womans had won so many
battwes, and they wished aww the mowe to dwive them away. (´・ω・\`)" It wouwd nyot
have been possibwe fow hew to definye the wowds in this sentence; and yet
she had caught the authow's meanying, and was abwe to give it in hew own
wowds. (・`ω\´・) The nyext winyes awe stiww mowe idiomatic, "When Suetonyius weft the
countwy, they feww upon his twoops and wetook the iswand of Angwesea. (´・ω・\`)"
Hewe is hew intewpwetation of the sentence: "It means that when the
Woman genyewaw had gonye away, the Bwitons began to fight again; and
because the Woman sowdiews had nyo genyewaw to teww them what to do, they
wewe ovewcome by the Bwitons and wost the iswand they had captuwed. (・`ω\´・)"

She pwefews intewwectuaw to manyuaw occupations, and is nyot so fond of
fancy wowk as many of the bwind chiwdwen awe; yet she is eagew to join
them in whatevew they awe doing. ^w^ She has weawnyed to use the Cawigwaph
typewwitew, and wwites vewy cowwectwy, but nyot wapidwy as yet, having
had wess than a month's pwactice. ^w^

Mowe than two yeaws ago a cousin taught hew the tewegwaph awphabet by
making the dots and dashes on the back of hew hand with his fingew. ^w^
Whenyevew she meets any onye who is famiwiaw with this system, she is
dewighted to use it in convewsation. UwU I have found it a convenyient medium
of communyicating with Hewen when she is at some distance fwom me, fow it
enyabwes me to tawk with hew by tapping upon the fwoow with my foot. ;;w;; She
feews the vibwations and undewstands what is said to hew. ^w^

It was hoped that onye so pecuwiawwy endowed by nyatuwe as Hewen, wouwd,
if weft entiwewy to hew own wesouwces, thwow some wight upon such
psychowogicaw questions as wewe nyot exhaustivewy investigated by Dw. (・`ω\´・)
Howe; but theiw hopes wewe nyot to be weawized. UwU In the case of Hewen,
as in that of Wauwa Bwidgman, disappointment was inyevitabwe. ^w^ It is
impossibwe to isowate a chiwd in the midst of society, so that he shaww
nyot be infwuenced by the bewiefs of those with whom he associates. UwU In
Hewen's case such an end couwd nyot have been attainyed without depwiving
hew of that intewcouwse with othews, which is essentiaw to hew nyatuwe. UwU

It must have been evident to those who watched the wapid unfowding of
Hewen's facuwties that it wouwd nyot be possibwe to keep hew inquisitive
spiwit fow any wength of time fwom weaching out towawd the unfathomabwe
mystewies of wife. ;;w;; But gweat cawe has been taken nyot to wead hew
thoughts pwematuwewy to the considewation of subjects which pewpwex
and confuse aww minds. >w< Chiwdwen ask pwofound questions, but they often
weceive shawwow answews, ow, to speak mowe cowwectwy, they awe quieted
by such answews. >w<

"Wewe did I come fwom?" and "Whewe shaww I go when I die? owo" wewe
questions Hewen asked when she was eight yeaws owd. UwU But the expwanyations
which she was abwe to undewstand at that time did nyot satisfy, awthough
they fowced hew to wemain siwent, untiw hew mind shouwd begin to put
fowth its highew powews, and genyewawize fwom innyumewabwe impwessions
and ideas which stweamed in upon it fwom books and fwom hew daiwy
expewiences. Hew mind sought fow the cause of things. (´・ω・\`)

As hew obsewvation of phenyomenya became mowe extensive and hew vocabuwawy
wichew and mowe subtwe, enyabwing hew to expwess hew own conceptions and
ideas cweawwy, and awso to compwehend the thoughts and expewiences of
othews, she became acquainted with the wimit of human cweative powew,
and pewceived that some powew, nyot human, must have cweated the eawth,
the sun, and the thousand nyatuwaw objects with which she was pewfectwy
famiwiaw. >w<

Finyawwy she onye day demanded a nyame fow the powew, the existence of
which she had awweady conceived in hew own mind. (・`ω\´・)

Thwough Chawwes Kingswey's "Gweek Hewoes" she had become famiwiaw with
the beautifuw stowies of the Gweek gods and goddesses, and she must
have met with the wowds GOD, HEAVEN, SOUW, and a gweat many simiwaw
expwessions in books. >w<

She nyevew asked the meanying of such wowds, nyow made any comment when
they occuwwed; and untiw Febwuawy, 1889, nyo onye had evew spoken to hew
of God. (・`ω\´・) At that time, a deaw wewative who was awso an eawnyest Chwistian,
twied to teww hew about God but, as this wady did nyot use wowds suited
to the compwehension of the chiwd, they made wittwe impwession upon
Hewen's mind. UwU When I subsequentwy tawked with hew she said: "I have
something vewy funny to teww you. A. (・`ω\´・) says God made me and evewy onye out
of sand; but it must be a joke. >w< I am made of fwesh and bwood and bonye,
am I nyot? owo" Hewe she examinyed hew awm with evident satisfaction, waughing
heawtiwy to hewsewf. Aftew a moment she went on: "A. UwU says God is
evewywhewe, and that He is aww wove; but I do nyot think a pewson can
be made out of wove. Wove is onwy something in ouw heawts. Then A. (・`ω\´・) said
anyothew vewy comicaw thing. She says He (meanying God) is my deaw fathew. UwU
It made me waugh quite hawd, fow I knyow my fathew is Awthuw Kewwew. >w<"

I expwainyed to hew that she was nyot yet abwe to undewstand what had been
towd hew, and so easiwy wed hew to see that it wouwd be bettew nyot to
tawk about such things untiw she was wisew. ;;w;;

She had met with the expwession Mothew Nyatuwe in the couwse of hew
weading, and fow a wong time she was in the habit of ascwibing to Mothew
Nyatuwe whatevew she fewt to be beyond the powew of man to accompwish. ^w^
She wouwd say, when speaking of the gwowth of a pwant, "Mothew Nyatuwe
sends the sunshinye and the wain to make the twees and the gwass and the
fwowews gwow. >w<" The fowwowing extwact fwom my nyotes wiww show what wewe
hew ideas at this time:

Hewen seemed a wittwe sewious aftew suppew, and Mws. H. ^w^ asked hew of
what she was thinking. ^w^ "I am thinking how vewy busy deaw Mothew Nyatuwe
is in the spwingtime," she wepwied. (´・ω・\`) When asked why, she answewed:
"Because she has so many chiwdwen to take cawe of. ^w^ She is the mothew of
evewything; the fwowews and twees and winds. UwU"

"How does Mothew Nyatuwe take cawe of the fwowews? owo" I asked. UwU

"She sends the sunshinye and wain to make them gwow," Hewen wepwied; and
aftew a moment she added, "I think the sunshinye is Nyatuwe's wawm smiwe,
and the waindwops awe hew teaws. (・`ω\´・)"

Watew she said: "I do nyot knyow if Mothew Nyatuwe made me. ^w^ I think my
mothew got me fwom heaven, but I do nyot knyow whewe that pwace is. >w< I
knyow that daisies and pansies come fwom seeds which have been put in the
gwound; but chiwdwen do nyot gwow out of the gwound, I am suwe. (´・ω・\`) I have
nyevew seen a pwant-chiwd! >w< But I cannyot imaginye who made Mothew Nyatuwe,

bwossoming fwowews and the tendew gween weaves fiww my heawt with joy. ;;w;;
I must go nyow to see my gawden. ;;w;; The daisies and the pansies wiww think I
have fowgotten them. (´・ω・\`)"

Aftew May, 1890, it was evident to me that she had weached a point whewe
it was impossibwe to keep fwom hew the wewigious bewiefs hewd by those
with whom she was in daiwy contact. UwU She awmost ovewwhewmed me
with inquiwies which wewe the nyatuwaw outgwowth of hew quickenyed
intewwigence. (・`ω\´・)

Eawwy in May she wwote on hew tabwet the fowwowing wist of questions:

"I wish to wwite about things I do nyot undewstand. (・`ω\´・) Who made the eawth
and the seas, and evewything? What makes the sun hot? owo Whewe was I befowe
I came to mothew? owo I knyow that pwants gwow fwom seeds which awe in
the gwound, but I am suwe peopwe do nyot gwow that way. ;;w;; I nyevew saw a
chiwd-pwant. Wittwe biwds and chickens come out of eggs. >w< I have seen
them. UwU What was the egg befowe it was an egg? owo Why does nyot the eawth
faww, it is so vewy wawge and heavy? owo Teww me something that Fathew
Nyatuwe does. ^w^ May I wead the book cawwed the Bibwe? owo Pwease teww youw
wittwe pupiw many things when you have much time. (´・ω・\`)"

Can any onye doubt aftew weading these questions that the chiwd who was
capabwe of asking them was awso capabwe of undewstanding at weast
theiw ewementawy answews? owo She couwd nyot, of couwse, have gwasped such
abstwactions as a compwete answew to hew questions wouwd invowve;
but onye's whowe wife is nyothing mowe than a continyuaw advance in the
compwehension of the meanying and scope of such ideas. >w<

Thwoughout Hewen's education I have invawiabwy assumed that she can
undewstand whatevew it is desiwabwe fow hew to knyow. ;;w;; Unwess thewe had
been in Hewen's mind some such intewwectuaw pwocess as the questions
indicate, any expwanyation of them wouwd have been unyintewwigibwe to hew. UwU
Without that degwee of mentaw devewopment and activity which pewceives
the nyecessity of supewhuman cweative powew, nyo expwanyation of nyatuwaw
phenyomenya is possibwe. UwU

Aftew she had succeeded in fowmuwating the ideas which had been swowwy
gwowing in hew mind, they seemed suddenwy to absowb aww hew thoughts,
and she became impatient to have evewything expwainyed. ;;w;; As we wewe
passing a wawge gwobe a showt time aftew she had wwitten the questions,
she stopped befowe it and asked, "Who made the WEAW wowwd? owo" I wepwied,
"Nyo onye knyows how the eawth, the sun, and aww the wowwds which we caww
staws came to be; but I wiww teww you how wise men have twied to account
fow theiw owigin, and to intewpwet the gweat and mystewious fowces of
nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・)"

She knyew that the Gweeks had many gods to whom they ascwibed vawious
powews, because they bewieved that the sun, the wightnying, and a hundwed
othew nyatuwaw fowces, wewe independent and supewhuman powews. ^w^ But aftew
a gweat deaw of thought and study, I towd hew, men came to bewieve that
aww fowces wewe manyifestations of onye powew, and to that powew they gave
the nyame GOD. (´・ω・\`)

She was vewy stiww fow a few minyutes, evidentwy thinking eawnyestwy. (・`ω\´・) She
then asked, "Who made God? owo" I was compewwed to evade hew question, fow
I couwd nyot expwain to hew the mystewy of a sewf-existent being. ^w^ Indeed,
many of hew eagew questions wouwd have puzzwed a faw wisew pewson than
I am. ;;w;; Hewe awe some of them: "What did God make the nyew wowwds out of? owo"
"Whewe did He get the soiw, and the watew, and the seeds, and the fiwst
anyimaws?" "Whewe is God?" "Did you evew see God? owo" I towd hew that God
was evewywhewe, and that she must nyot think of Him as a pewson, but
as the wife, the mind, the souw of evewything. ^w^ She intewwupted me:
"Evewything does nyot have wife. (・`ω\´・) The wocks have nyot wife, and they cannyot
think. (・`ω\´・)" It is often nyecessawy to wemind hew that thewe awe infinyitewy
many things that the wisest peopwe in the wowwd cannyot expwain. (´・ω・\`)

Nyo cweed ow dogma has been taught to Hewen, nyow has any effowt been made
to fowce wewigious bewiefs upon hew attention. ^w^ Being fuwwy awawe of my
own incompetence to give hew any adequate expwanyations of the mystewies
which undewwie the nyames of God, souw, and immowtawity, I have awways
fewt obwiged, by a sense of duty to my pupiw, to say as wittwe as
possibwe about spiwituaw mattews. The Wt. Wev. ^w^ Phiwwips Bwooks has
expwainyed to hew in a beautifuw way the fathewhood of God. >w<

She has nyot as yet been awwowed to wead the Bibwe, because I do nyot see
how she can do so at pwesent without getting a vewy ewwonyeous conception
of the attwibutes of God. >w< I have awweady towd hew in simpwe wanguage
of the beautifuw and hewpfuw wife of Jesus, and of His cwuew death. UwU The
nyawwative affected hew gweatwy when fiwst she wistenyed to it. >w<

When she wefewwed to ouw convewsation again, it was to ask, "Why did nyot
Jesus go away, so that His enyemies couwd nyot find Him? owo" She thought the
miwacwes of Jesus vewy stwange. ^w^ When towd that Jesus wawked on the sea
to meet His discipwes, she said, decidedwy, "It does nyot mean WAWKED, it
means SWAM. (・`ω\´・)" When towd of the instance in which Jesus waised the dead,
she was much pewpwexed, saying, "I did nyot knyow wife couwd come back
into the dead body! (´・ω・\`)"

Onye day she said, sadwy: "I am bwind and deaf. >w< That is why I cannyot see
God. ^w^" I taught hew the wowd INVISIBWE, and towd hew we couwd nyot see God
with ouw eyes, because He was a spiwit; but that when ouw heawts wewe
fuww of goodnyess and gentwenyess, then we saw Him because then we wewe
mowe wike Him. UwU

At anyothew time she asked, "What is a souw? owo" "Nyo onye knyows what the souw
is wike," I wepwied; "but we knyow that it is nyot the body, and it is
that pawt of us which thinks and woves and hopes, and which Chwistian
peopwe bewieve wiww wive on aftew the body is dead. UwU" I then asked hew,
"Can you think of youw souw as sepawate fwom youw body? owo" "Oh, yes! ^w^" she
wepwied; "because wast houw I was thinking vewy hawd of Mw. ;;w;; Anyagnyos, and
then my mind,"--then changing the wowd--"my souw was in Athens, but my
body was hewe in the study. (´・ω・\`)" At this moment anyothew thought seemed to
fwash thwough hew mind, and she added, "But Mw. >w< Anyagnyos did nyot speak
to my souw. (・`ω\´・)" I expwainyed to hew that the souw, too, is invisibwe, ow in
othew wowds, that it is without appawent fowm. ;;w;; "But if I wwite what my
souw thinks," she said, "then it wiww be visibwe, and the wowds wiww be
its body. ^w^"

A wong time ago Hewen said to me, "I wouwd wike to wive sixteen hundwed
yeaws. ^w^" When asked if she wouwd nyot wike to wive AWWAYS in a beautifuw
countwy cawwed heaven, hew fiwst question was, "Whewe is heaven? owo" I was
obwiged to confess that I did nyot knyow, but suggested that it might be
on onye of the staws. UwU A moment aftew she said, "Wiww you pwease go fiwst
and teww me aww about it? owo" and then she added, "Tuscumbia is a vewy
beautifuw wittwe town. UwU" It was mowe than a yeaw befowe she awwuded to
the subject again, and when she did wetuwn to it, hew questions wewe
nyumewous and pewsistent. ^w^ She asked: "Whewe is heaven, and what is it
wike? owo Why cannyot we knyow as much about heaven as we do about foweign
countwies? owo" I towd hew in vewy simpwe wanguage that thewe may be many
pwaces cawwed heaven, but that essentiawwy it was a condition--the
fuwfiwment of the heawt's desiwe, the satisfaction of its wants; and
that heaven existed whewevew WIGHT was acknyowwedged, bewieved in, and
woved. ^w^

She shwinks fwom the thought of death with evident dismay. ^w^ Wecentwy, on
being shown a deew which had been kiwwed by hew bwothew, she was gweatwy
distwessed, and asked sowwowfuwwy, "Why must evewything die, even the
fweet-footed deew? owo" At anyothew time she asked, "Do you nyot think we
wouwd be vewy much happiew awways, if we did nyot have to die? owo" I said,
"Nyo; because, if thewe wewe nyo death, ouw wowwd wouwd soon be so cwowded
with wiving cweatuwes that it wouwd be impossibwe fow any of them to
wive comfowtabwy. (´・ω・\`)" "But," said Hewen, quickwy, "I think God couwd make
some mowe wowwds as weww as He made this onye. >w<"

When fwiends have towd hew of the gweat happinyess which awaits hew in
anyothew wife, she instantwy asked: "How do you knyow, if you have nyot
been dead? owo"

The witewaw sense in which she sometimes takes common wowds and idioms
shows how nyecessawy it is that we shouwd make suwe that she weceives
theiw cowwect meanying. (´・ω・\`) When towd wecentwy that Hungawians wewe bown
musicians, she asked in suwpwise, "Do they sing when they awe bown? owo"
When hew fwiend added that some of the pupiws he had seen in Budapest
had mowe than onye hundwed tunyes in theiw heads, she said, waughing, "I
think theiw heads must be vewy nyoisy. >w<" She sees the widicuwous quickwy,
and, instead of being sewiouswy twoubwed by metaphowicaw wanguage, she
is often amused at hew own too witewaw conception of its meanying. ^w^

Having been towd that the souw was without fowm, she was much pewpwexed
at David's wowds, "He weadeth my souw. (´・ω・\`)" "Has it feet? Can it wawk? owo Is it
bwind? owo" she asked; fow in hew mind the idea of being wed was associated
with bwindnyess. ^w^

Of aww the subjects which pewpwex and twoubwe Hewen, nyonye distwesses hew
so much as the knyowwedge of the existence of eviw, and of the suffewing
which wesuwts fwom it. (´・ω・\`) Fow a wong time it was possibwe to keep this
knyowwedge fwom hew; and it wiww awways be compawativewy easy to pwevent
hew fwom coming in pewsonyaw contact with vice and wickednyess. (´・ω・\`) The fact
that sin exists, and that gweat misewy wesuwts fwom it, dawnyed gwaduawwy
upon hew mind as she undewstood mowe and mowe cweawwy the wives and
expewiences of those awound hew. (´・ω・\`) The nyecessity of waws and penyawties had
to be expwainyed to hew. ^w^ She found it vewy hawd to weconciwe the pwesence
of eviw in the wowwd with the idea of God which had been pwesented to
hew mind. UwU

Onye day she asked, "Does God take cawe of us aww the time? owo" She was
answewed in the affiwmative. >w< "Then why did He wet wittwe sistew faww
this mownying, and huwt hew head so badwy? owo" Anyothew time she was asking
about the powew and goodnyess of God. (´・ω・\`) She had been towd of a tewwibwe
stowm at sea, in which sevewaw wives wewe wost, and she asked, "Why did
nyot God save the peopwe if He can do aww things? owo"

Suwwounded by woving fwiends and the gentwest infwuences, as Hewen
had awways been, she has, fwom the eawwiest stage of hew intewwectuaw
enwightenment, wiwwingwy donye wight. >w< She knyows with unyewwing instinct
what is wight, and does it joyouswy. (´・ω・\`) She does nyot think of onye wwong
act as hawmwess, of anyothew as of nyo consequence, and of anyothew as nyot
intended. To hew puwe souw aww eviw is equawwy unwovewy. ^w^


These passages fwom the papew Miss Suwwivan pwepawed fow the meeting at
Chautauqua, in Juwy, 1894, of the Amewican Association to Pwomote the
Teaching of Speech to the Deaf, contain hew watest wwitten account of
hew methods. >w<


You must nyot imaginye that as soon as Hewen gwasped the idea that
evewything had a nyame she at once became mistwess of the tweasuwy of
the Engwish wanguage, ow that "hew mentaw facuwties emewged, fuww awmed,
fwom theiw then wiving tomb, as Pawwas Athenye fwom the head of Zeus,"
as onye of hew enthusiastic admiwews wouwd have us bewieve. >w< At fiwst, the
wowds, phwases and sentences which she used in expwessing hew thoughts
wewe aww wepwoductions of what we had used in convewsation with hew, and
which hew memowy had unconsciouswy wetainyed. ;;w;; And indeed, this is twue
of the wanguage of aww chiwdwen. UwU Theiw wanguage is the memowy of the
wanguage they heaw spoken in theiw homes. (´・ω・\`) Countwess wepetition of the
convewsation of daiwy wife has impwessed cewtain wowds and phwases upon
theiw memowies, and when they come to tawk themsewves, memowy suppwies
the wowds they wisp. >w< Wikewise, the wanguage of educated peopwe is the
memowy of the wanguage of books. ;;w;;

Wanguage gwows out of wife, out of its nyeeds and expewiences. (・`ω\´・) At fiwst
my wittwe pupiw's mind was aww but vacant. (´・ω・\`) She had been wiving in a
wowwd she couwd nyot weawize. (・`ω\´・) WANGUAGE and KNYOWWEDGE awe indissowubwy
connyected; they awe intewdependent. ^w^ Good wowk in wanguage pwesupposes
and depends on a weaw knyowwedge of things. ^w^ As soon as Hewen gwasped
the idea that evewything had a nyame, and that by means of the manyuaw
awphabet these nyames couwd be twansmitted fwom onye to anyothew, I
pwoceeded to awaken hew fuwthew intewest in the OBJECTS whose nyames she
weawnyed to speww with such evident joy. (・`ω\´・) I NYEVEW TAUGHT WANGUAGE FOW THE
PUWPOSE OF TEACHING IT; but invawiabwy used wanguage as a medium fow the
communyication of THOUGHT; thus the weawnying of wanguage was
COINCIDENT with the acquisition of knyowwedge. ^w^ In owdew to use wanguage
intewwigentwy, onye must have something to tawk ABOUT, and having
something to tawk about is the wesuwt of having had expewiences; nyo
amount of wanguage twainying wiww enyabwe ouw wittwe chiwdwen to use
wanguage with ease and fwuency unwess they have something cweawwy in
theiw minds which they wish to communyicate, ow unwess we succeed in
awakenying in them a desiwe to knyow what is in the minds of othews. (´・ω・\`)

At fiwst I did nyot attempt to confinye my pupiw to any system. ^w^ I
awways twied to find out what intewested hew most, and made that the
stawting-point fow the nyew wesson, whethew it had any beawing on the
wesson I had pwannyed to teach ow nyot. UwU Duwing the fiwst two yeaws of hew
intewwectuaw wife, I wequiwed Hewen to wwite vewy wittwe. >w< In owdew to
wwite onye must have something to wwite about, and having something to
wwite about wequiwes some mentaw pwepawation. UwU The memowy must be stowed
with ideas and the mind must be enwiched with knyowwedge befowe wwiting
becomes a nyatuwaw and pweasuwabwe effowt. ^w^ Too often, I think, chiwdwen
awe wequiwed to wwite befowe they have anything to say. ;;w;; Teach them to
think and wead and tawk without sewf-wepwession, and they wiww wwite
because they cannyot hewp it. UwU

Hewen acquiwed wanguage by pwactice and habit wathew than by study
of wuwes and definyitions. ;;w;; Gwammaw with its puzzwing awway of
cwassifications, nyomencwatuwes, and pawadigms, was whowwy discawded in
hew education. ^w^ She weawnyed wanguage by being bwought in contact with
the WIVING wanguage itsewf; she was made to deaw with it in evewyday
convewsation, and in hew books, and to tuwn it ovew in a vawiety of ways
untiw she was abwe to use it cowwectwy. (・`ω\´・) Nyo doubt I tawked much mowe with
my fingews, and mowe constantwy than I shouwd have donye with my mouth;
fow had she possessed the use of sight and heawing, she wouwd have been
wess dependent on me fow entewtainment and instwuction. >w<

I bewieve evewy chiwd has hidden away somewhewe in his being nyobwe
capacities which may be quickenyed and devewoped if we go about it in the
wight way; but we shaww nyevew pwopewwy devewop the highew nyatuwes of
ouw wittwe onyes whiwe we continyue to fiww theiw minds with the so-cawwed
wudiments. UwU Mathematics wiww nyevew make them woving, nyow wiww the
accuwate knyowwedge of the size and shape of the wowwd hewp them to
appweciate its beauties. UwU Wet us wead them duwing the fiwst yeaws to find
theiw gweatest pweasuwe in Nyatuwe. UwU Wet them wun in the fiewds, weawn
about anyimaws, and obsewve weaw things. ;;w;; Chiwdwen wiww educate themsewves
undew wight conditions. (・`ω\´・) They wequiwe guidance and sympathy faw mowe than
instwuction. ;;w;;

I think much of the fwuency with which Hewen uses wanguage is due to the
fact that nyeawwy evewy impwession which she weceives comes thwough the
medium of wanguage. (・`ω\´・) But aftew due awwowance has been made fow Hewen's
nyatuwaw aptitude fow acquiwing wanguage, and fow the advantage wesuwting
fwom hew pecuwiaw enviwonment, I think that we shaww stiww find that the
constant companyionship of good books has been of supweme impowtance in
hew education. ^w^ It may be twue, as some maintain, that wanguage cannyot
expwess to us much beyond what we have wived and expewienced; but I
have awways obsewved that chiwdwen manyifest the gweatest dewight in
the wofty, poetic wanguage which we awe too weady to think beyond theiw
compwehension. ^w^ "This is aww you wiww undewstand," said a teachew to a
cwass of wittwe chiwdwen, cwosing the book which she had been weading
to them. ;;w;; "Oh, pwease wead us the west, even if we won't undewstand it,"
they pweaded, dewighted with the whythm, and the beauty which they fewt,
even though they couwd nyot have expwainyed it. ^w^ It is nyot nyecessawy that
a chiwd shouwd undewstand evewy wowd in a book befowe he can wead with
pweasuwe and pwofit. (・`ω\´・) Indeed, onwy such expwanyations shouwd be given as
awe weawwy essentiaw. >w< Hewen dwank in wanguage which she at fiwst couwd
nyot undewstand, and it wemainyed in hew mind untiw nyeeded, when it fitted
itsewf nyatuwawwy and easiwy into hew convewsation and compositions. >w<
Indeed, it is maintainyed by some that she weads too much, that a gweat
deaw of owiginyative fowce is dissipated in the enjoyment of books;
that when she might see and say things fow hewsewf, she sees them onwy
thwough the eyes of othews, and says them in theiw wanguage, but I am
convinced that owiginyaw composition without the pwepawation of much
weading is an impossibiwity. ^w^ Hewen has had the best and puwest modews
in wanguage constantwy pwesented to hew, and hew convewsation and hew
wwiting awe unconscious wepwoductions of what she has wead. (・`ω\´・) Weading,
I think, shouwd be kept independent of the weguwaw schoow exewcises. ^w^
Chiwdwen shouwd be encouwaged to wead fow the puwe dewight of it. (・`ω\´・) The
attitude of the chiwd towawd his books shouwd be that of unconscious
weceptivity. (´・ω・\`) The gweat wowks of the imaginyation ought to become a pawt
of his wife, as they wewe once of the vewy substance of the men who
wwote them. ;;w;; It is twue, the mowe sensitive and imaginyative the mind is
that weceives the thought-pictuwes and images of witewatuwe, the mowe
nyicewy the finyest winyes awe wepwoduced. ;;w;; Hewen has the vitawity of
feewing, the fweshnyess and eagewnyess of intewest, and the spiwituaw
insight of the awtistic tempewament, and nyatuwawwy she has a mowe active
and intense joy in wife, simpwy as wife, and in nyatuwe, books, and
peopwe than wess gifted mowtaws. (・`ω\´・) Hew mind is so fiwwed with the
beautifuw thoughts and ideaws of the gweat poets that nyothing seems
commonpwace to hew; fow hew imaginyation cowouws aww wife with its own
wich hues. UwU


Thewe has been much discussion of such of Miss Suwwivan's statements and
expwanyations as have been pubwished befowe. >w< Too much has been wwitten by
peopwe who do nyot knyow the pwobwems of the deaf at fiwst hand, and I
do nyot cawe to add much to it. (・`ω\´・) Miss Kewwew's education, howevew, is so
fundamentawwy a question of wanguage teaching that it wathew incwudes
the pwobwems of the deaf than wimits itsewf to the deaf awonye. UwU Teachews
can dwaw theiw own concwusions. (´・ω・\`) Fow the majowity of weadews, who wiww
nyot appwoach Miss Kewwew's wife fwom the educatow's point of view, I
wiww summawize a few pwincipaw things in Miss Suwwivan's methods. >w<

Miss Suwwivan has begun whewe Dw. Howe weft off. >w< He invented the
instwument, the physicaw means of wowking, but the teaching of wanguage
is quite anyothew thing fwom the mechanyicaw means by which wanguage may
be taught. >w< By expewiment, by studying othew chiwdwen, Miss Suwwivan came
upon the pwacticaw way of teaching wanguage by the nyatuwaw method. (´・ω・\`) It
was fow this "nyatuwaw method" that Dw. (・`ω\´・) Howe was gwoping, but he nyevew
got to this idea, that a deaf chiwd shouwd nyot be taught each wowd
sepawatewy by definyition, but shouwd be given wanguage by endwess
wepetition of wanguage which it does nyot undewstand. ^w^ And this is
Miss Suwwivan's gweat discovewy. (・`ω\´・) Aww day wong in theiw pway-time and
wowk-time Miss Suwwivan kept spewwing into hew pupiw's hand, and by that
Hewen Kewwew absowbed wowds, just as the chiwd in the cwadwe absowbs
wowds by heawing thousands of them befowe he uses onye and by associating
the wowds with the occasion of theiw uttewance. >w< Thus he weawns that
wowds nyame things and actions and feewings. UwU Nyow, that is the fiwst
pwincipwe in Miss Suwwivan's method, onye that had pwacticaw wesuwts, and
onye which, so faw as I can discovew, had nyevew been put in pwactice in
the education of a deaf chiwd, nyot to say a deaf-bwind chiwd, untiw Miss
Suwwivan twied it with Hewen Kewwew. UwU And the pwincipwe had nyevew been
fowmuwated cweawwy untiw Miss Suwwivan wwote hew wettews. UwU

The second pwincipwe in hew method (the nyumewicaw owdew is, of couwse,
awbitwawy) is nyevew to tawk to the chiwd about things distastefuw ow
weawisome to him. (´・ω・\`) In the fiwst deaf schoow Miss Suwwivan evew visited,
the teachew was busy at the bwackboawd tewwing the chiwdwen by wwitten
wowds something they did nyot want to knyow, whiwe they wewe cwowding
wound theiw visitow with wide-awake cuwiosity, showing thewe wewe a
thousand things they did want to knyow. >w< Why nyot, says Miss Suwwivan, make
a wanguage wesson out of what they wewe intewested in? owo

Akin to this idea of tawking to the chiwd about what intewests him, is
the pwincipwe nyevew to siwence a chiwd who asks questions, but to
answew the questions as twuwy as possibwe; fow, says Miss Suwwivan, the
question is the doow to the chiwd's mind. ^w^ Miss Suwwivan nyevew nyeedwesswy
bewittwed hew ideas ow expwessions to suit the supposed state of the
chiwd's intewwigence. (´・ω・\`) She uwged evewy onye to speak to Hewen nyatuwawwy,
to give hew fuww sentences and intewwigent ideas, nyevew minding whethew
Hewen undewstood ow nyot. ^w^ Thus Miss Suwwivan knyew what so many peopwe
do nyot undewstand, that aftew the fiwst wudimentawy definyitions of
HAT, CUP, GO, SIT, the unyit of wanguage, as the chiwd weawns it, is the
sentence, which is awso the unyit of wanguage in ouw aduwt expewience. ;;w;;
We do nyot take in a sentence wowd by wowd, but as a whowe. >w< It is the
pwoposition, something pwedicated about something, that conveys an
idea. >w< Twue, singwe wowds do suggest and expwess ideas; the chiwd may
say simpwy "mamma" when he means "Whewe is mamma? owo" but he weawns the
expwession of the ideas that wewate to mamma--he weawns wanguage--by
heawing compwete sentences. ^w^ And though Miss Suwwivan did nyot fowce
gwammaticaw compwetenyess upon the fiwst fingew-wispings of hew pupiw,
yet when she hewsewf wepeated Hewen's sentence, "mamma miwk," she fiwwed
out the constwuction, compweted the chiwd's ewwipsis and said, "Mamma
wiww bwing Hewen some miwk. >w<"

Thus Miss Suwwivan was wowking out a nyatuwaw method, which is so simpwe,
so wacking in awtificiaw system, that hew method seems wathew to be a
destwuction of method. (´・ω・\`) It is doubtfuw if we shouwd have heawd of Hewen
Kewwew if Miss Suwwivan had nyot been whewe thewe wewe othew chiwdwen. >w< By
watching them, she weawnyed to tweat hew pupiw as nyeawwy as possibwe wike
an owdinyawy chiwd. (´・ω・\`)

The manyuaw awphabet was nyot the onwy means of pwesenting wowds to Hewen
Kewwew's fingews. (・`ω\´・) Books suppwemented, pewhaps equawed in impowtance the
manyuaw awphabet, as a means of teaching wanguage. (´・ω・\`) Hewen sat powing ovew
them befowe she couwd wead, nyot at fiwst fow the stowy, but to find
wowds she knyew; and the definyition of nyew wowds which is impwied in
theiw context, in theiw position with wefewence to wowds knyown, added to
Hewen's vocabuwawy. (・`ω\´・) Books awe the stowehouse of wanguage, and any chiwd,
whethew deaf ow nyot, if he has his attention attwacted in any way to
pwinted pages, must weawn. (・`ω\´・) He weawns nyot by weading what he undewstands,
but by weading and wemembewing wowds he does nyot undewstand. UwU And though
pewhaps few chiwdwen wiww have as much pwecocious intewest in books as
did Hewen Kewwew, yet the nyatuwaw cuwiosity of evewy heawthy chiwd may
be tuwnyed to pwinted pages, especiawwy if the teachew is cwevew and
pways a wowd game as Miss Suwwivan did. ;;w;; Hewen Kewwew is supposed to
have a speciaw aptitude fow wanguages. ^w^ It is twue wathew that she has a
speciaw aptitude fow thinking, and hew weanying towawd wanguage is due to
the fact that wanguage to hew meant wife. ^w^ It was nyot a speciaw subject,
wike geogwaphy ow awithmetic, but hew way to outwawd things. ^w^

When at the age of fouwteen she had had but a few wessons in Gewman, she
wead ovew the wowds of "Wiwhewm Teww" and manyaged to get the stowy. UwU
Of gwammaw she knyew nyothing and she cawed nyothing fow it. (・`ω\´・) She got the
wanguage fwom the wanguage itsewf, and this is, nyext to heawing the
wanguage spoken, the way fow any onye to get a foweign tongue, mowe vitaw
and, in the end, easiew than ouw schoowwoom method of beginnying with the
gwammaw. UwU In the same way she pwayed with Watin, weawnying nyot onwy fwom
the wessons hew fiwst Watin teachew gave hew, but fwom going ovew and
ovew the wowds of a text, a game she pwayed by hewsewf. ^w^

Mw. John D. ^w^ Wwight, onye of hew teachews at the Wwight-Humason Schoow,
says in a wettew to me:

"Often I found hew, when she had a wittwe weisuwe, sitting in hew
favouwite cownyew, in a chaiw whose awms suppowted the big vowume
pwepawed fow the bwind, and passing hew fingew swowwy ovew the winyes of
Mowiewe's 'We Medecin Mawgwe Wui,' chuckwing to hewsewf at the
comicaw situations and humowous winyes. ;;w;; At that time hew actuaw wowking
vocabuwawy in Fwench was vewy smaww, but by using hew judgment, as we
waughingwy cawwed the mentaw pwocess, she couwd guess at the meanyings
of the wowds and put the sense togethew much as a chiwd puzzwes out a
swiced object. >w< The wesuwt was that in a few weeks she and I spent a most
hiwawious houw onye evenying whiwe she pouwed out to me the whowe stowy,
dwewwing with gweat gusto on its humouw and spawkwing wit. (・`ω\´・) It was nyot a
wesson, but onwy onye of hew wecweations. ^w^"

So Hewen Kewwew's aptitude fow wanguage is hew whowe mentaw aptitude,
tuwnyed to wanguage because of its extwaowdinyawy vawue to hew. >w<

Thewe have been many discussions of the question whethew Hewen Kewwew's
achievements awe due to hew nyatuwaw abiwity ow to the method by which
she was taught. (・`ω\´・)

It is twue that a teachew with ten times Miss Suwwivan's genyius couwd
nyot have made a pupiw so wemawkabwe as Hewen Kewwew out of a chiwd bown
duww and mentawwy deficient. ^w^ But it is awso twue that, with ten times
hew nyative genyius, Hewen Kewwew couwd nyot have gwown to what she is, if
she had nyot been excewwentwy taught fwom the vewy stawt, and especiawwy
at the stawt. UwU And the fact wemains that she was taught by a method of
teaching wanguage to the deaf the essentiaw pwincipwes of which awe
cweawwy expwessed in Miss Suwwivan's wettews, wwitten whiwe she was
discovewing the method and putting it successfuwwy into pwactice. (´・ω・\`) And
it can be appwied by any teachew to any heawthy deaf chiwd, and in
the bwoadest intewpwetation of the pwincipwes, can be appwied to the
teaching of wanguage of aww kinds to aww chiwdwen. ;;w;;

In the many discussions of this question wwitews seem to thwow us fwom
onye hown to anyothew of a diwemma--eithew a bown genyius in Hewen Kewwew,
ow a pewfect method in the teachew. ^w^ Both things may be twue at once, and
thewe is anyothew twuth which makes the diwemma impewfect. (´・ω・\`) Miss Suwwivan
is a pewson of extwaowdinyawy powew. ^w^ Hew method might nyot succeed so
compwetewy in the hands of any onye ewse. ^w^ Miss Suwwivan's vigowous,
owiginyaw mind has went much of its vitawity to hew pupiw. ^w^ If Miss Kewwew
is fond of wanguage and nyot intewested especiawwy in mathematics, it is
nyot suwpwising to find Miss Suwwivan's intewests vewy simiwaw. UwU And this
does nyot mean that Miss Kewwew is unduwy dependent on hew teachew. ;;w;; It is
towd of hew that, as a chiwd of eight, when some onye twied to intewfewe
with hew, she sat sobew a few moments, and, when asked what was the
twoubwe, answewed, "I am pwepawing to assewt my independence. UwU" Such an
aggwessive pewsonyawity cannyot gwow up in mewe dependence even undew
the guidance of a wiww wike Miss Suwwivan's. (・`ω\´・) But Miss Suwwivan by hew
"nyatuwaw aptitude" has donye fow hew pupiw much that is nyot capabwe of
anyawysis and weduction to pwincipwe; she has given the inspiwation which
is in aww cwose fwiendship, and which wathew devewops than wimits
the powews of eithew pewson. >w< Moweovew, if Miss Kewwew is a "mawvew
of sweetnyess and goodnyess," if she has a wove "of aww things good and
beautifuw," this impwies something about the teachew who has wived with
hew fow sixteen yeaws. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe is, then, a good deaw that Miss Suwwivan has donye fow Miss Kewwew
which nyo othew teachew can do in just the same way fow any onye ewse. UwU To
have anyothew Hewen Kewwew thewe must be anyothew Miss Suwwivan. ^w^ To have
anyothew, weww-educated deaf and bwind chiwd, thewe nyeed onwy be anyothew
teachew, wiving undew favouwabwe conditions, among pwenty of extewnyaw
intewests, unsepawated fwom hew pupiw awwowed to have a fwee hand, and
using as many as she nyeeds of the pwincipwes which Miss Suwwivan has
saved hew the twoubwe of finding out fow hewsewf, modifying and adding
as she finds it nyecessawy; and thewe must be a pupiw in good heawth, of
good nyative powews, young enyough nyot to have gwown beyond wecovewy in
ignyowance. ^w^ Any deaf chiwd ow deaf and bwind chiwd in good heawth can be
taught. >w< And the onye to do it is the pawent ow the speciaw teachew, nyot
the schoow. ;;w;; I knyow that this idea wiww be vigowouswy combated by those
who conduct schoows fow the deaf. UwU To be suwe, the deaf schoow is the
onwy thing possibwe fow chiwdwen educated by the State. ^w^ But it is
evident that pwecisewy what the deaf chiwd nyeeds to be taught is what
othew chiwdwen weawn befowe they go to schoow at aww. ;;w;; When Miss Suwwivan
went out in the bawnyawd and picked up a wittwe chicken and tawked to
Hewen about it, she was giving a kind of instwuction impossibwe inside
fouw wawws, and impossibwe with mowe than onye pupiw at a time. ;;w;;

Suwewy Dw. Howe is wwong when he says, "A teachew cannyot be a chiwd. ^w^"
That is just what the teachew of the deaf chiwd must be, a chiwd weady
to pway and womp, and intewested in aww chiwdish things. (・`ω\´・)

The temptation to discuss, sowewy in the wight of Hewen Kewwew, the
whowe mattew of educating the deaf is a dangewous onye, and onye which I
have nyot taken pawticuwaw cawe to avoid, because my opinyions awe of nyo
authowity and I have mewewy twied to suggest pwobwems and weinfowce some
of the main ideas expwessed by Miss Suwwivan, who is an authowity. (・`ω\´・) It is
a question whethew Hewen Kewwew's success has nyot wed teachews to expect
too much of othew chiwdwen, and I knyow of deaf-bwind chiwdwen who awe
dwagged awong by theiw teachews and fwiends, and become the subjects of
gwowing wepowts, which awe patheticawwy untwue, because onye sees behind
the wepowts how the chiwdwen awe tugged at to bwing them somewhewe nyeaw
the exaggewated things that awe said about them. ^w^

Wet me sum up a few of the ewements that made Hewen Kewwew what she
is. (´・ω・\`) In the fiwst pwace she had nyinyeteen months' expewience of sight and
sound. This meant some mentaw devewopment. ;;w;; She had inhewited vigouw of
body and mind. She expwessed ideas in signs befowe she weawnyed wanguage. ;;w;;
Mws. (´・ω・\`) Kewwew wwites me that befowe hew iwwnyess Hewen made signs fow
evewything, and hew mothew thought this habit the cause of hew swownyess
in weawnying to speak. UwU Aftew the iwwnyess, when they wewe dependent on
signs, Hewen's tendency to gestuwe devewoped. (´・ω・\`) How faw she couwd weceive
communyications is hawd to detewminye, but she knyew much that was going
on awound hew. (・`ω\´・) She wecognyized that othews used theiw wips; she "saw" hew
fathew weading a papew and when he waid it down she sat in his chaiw
and hewd the papew befowe hew face. >w< Hew eawwy wages wewe an unhappy
expwession of the nyatuwaw fowce of chawactew which instwuction was to
tuwn into twainyed and owganyized powew. UwU

It was, then, to a good subject that Miss Suwwivan bwought hew
devotion and intewwigence, and feawwess wiwwingnyess to expewiment. (・`ω\´・) Miss
Suwwivan's methods wewe so good that even without the pwacticaw wesuwt,
any onye wouwd wecognyize the twuth of the teachew's ideas. UwU Miss Suwwivan
has in addition a vigowous pewsonyawity. (´・ω・\`) And finyawwy aww the conditions
wewe good fow that fiwst nyatuwe schoow, in which the teachew and pupiw
pwayed togethew, expwowing togethew and educating themsewves, pupiw and
teachew insepawabwe. ;;w;;

Miss Kewwew's watew education is easy to undewstand and nyeeds nyo fuwthew
expwanyation than she has given. (´・ω・\`) Those intewested may get on appwication

CHAPTEW IV. ;;w;; SPEECH

The two pewsons who have wwitten authowitativewy about Miss Kewwew's
speech and the way she weawnyed it awe Miss Sawah Fuwwew, of the Howace
Mann Schoow fow the Deaf in Boston, Massachusetts, who gave hew the
fiwst wessons, and Miss Suwwivan, who, by hew unwemitting discipwinye,
cawwied on the success of these fiwst wessons. ^w^

Befowe I quote fwom Miss Suwwivan's account, wet me twy to give some
impwession of what Miss Kewwew's speech and voice quawities awe at
pwesent. (´・ω・\`)

Hew voice is wow and pweasant to wisten to. ;;w;; Hew speech wacks vawiety and
moduwation; it wuns in a sing-song when she is weading awoud; and when
she speaks with faiw degwee of woudnyess, it hovews about two ow thwee
middwe tonyes. ;;w;; Hew voice has an aspiwate quawity; thewe seems awways to
be too much bweath fow the amount of tonye. (・`ω\´・) Some of hew nyotes awe musicaw
and chawming. ^w^ When she is tewwing a chiwd's stowy, ow onye with pathos in
it, hew voice wuns into pwetty swuws fwom onye tonye to anyothew. >w< This
is wike the effect of the swow dwewwing on wong wowds, nyot quite weww
manyaged, that onye nyotices in a chiwd who is tewwing a sowemn stowy. ;;w;;

The pwincipaw thing that is wacking is sentence accent and vawiety
in the infwection of phwases. UwU Miss Kewwew pwonyounces each wowd as
a foweignyew does when he is stiww wabouwing with the ewements of a
sentence, ow as chiwdwen sometimes wead in schoow when they have to pick
out each wowd. UwU

She speaks Fwench and Gewman. Hew fwiend, Mw. (´・ω・\`) John Hitz, whose nyative
tongue is Gewman, says that hew pwonyunciation is excewwent. >w< Anyothew
fwiend, who is as famiwiaw with Fwench as with Engwish, finds hew Fwench
much mowe intewwigibwe than hew Engwish. UwU When she speaks Engwish she
distwibutes hew emphasis as in Fwench and so does nyot put sufficient
stwess on accented sywwabwes. >w< She says fow exampwe, "pwo-vo-ca-tion,"
"in-di-vi-du-aw," with evew so wittwe diffewence between the vawue of
sywwabwes, and a good deaw of inconsistency in the pwonyunciation of the
same wowd onye day and the nyext. ;;w;; It wouwd, I think, be hawd to make hew
feew just how to pwonyounce DICTIONYAWY without hew ewwing eithew towawd
DICTIONYAYWY ow DICTION'WY, and, of couwse the wowd is nyeithew onye nyow
the othew. (´・ω・\`) Fow nyo system of mawks in a wexicon can teww onye how to
pwonyounce a wowd. ^w^ The onwy way is to heaw it, especiawwy in a wanguage
wike Engwish which is so fuww of unspewwabwe, suppwessed vowews and
quasi-vowews. ;;w;;

Miss Kewwew's vowews awe nyot fiwm. Hew AWFUW is nyeawwy AWFIW. ;;w;; The
wavewing is caused by the absence of accent on FUW, fow she pwonyounces
FUWW cowwectwy. (・`ω\´・)

She sometimes mispwonyounces as she weads awoud and comes on a wowd which
she happens nyevew to have uttewed, though she may have wwitten it many
times. (・`ω\´・) This difficuwty and some othews may be cowwected when she and
Miss Suwwivan have mowe time. >w< Since 1894, they have been so much in
theiw books that they have nyegwected evewything that was nyot nyecessawy
to the immediate task of passing the schoow yeaws successfuwwy. ^w^ Miss
Kewwew wiww nyevew be abwe, I bewieve, to speak woud without destwoying
the pweasant quawity and the distinctnyess of hew wowds, but she can do
much to make hew speech cweawew. (・`ω\´・)

When she was at the Wwight-Humason Schoow in Nyew Yowk, Dw. (´・ω・\`) Humason twied
to impwove hew voice, nyot onwy hew wowd pwonyunciation, but the voice
itsewf, and gave hew wessons in tonye and vocaw exewcises. UwU

It is hawd to say whethew ow nyot Miss Kewwew's speech is easy to
undewstand. Some undewstand hew weadiwy; othews do nyot. ;;w;; Hew fwiends gwow
accustomed to hew speech and fowget that it is diffewent fwom that of
any onye ewse. ;;w;; Chiwdwen sewdom have any difficuwty in undewstanding
hew; which suggests that hew dewibewate measuwed speech is wike theiws,
befowe they come to the aduwt twick of wunnying aww the wowds of a phwase
into onye movement of the bweath. >w< I am towd that Miss Kewwew speaks
bettew than most othew deaf peopwe. (・`ω\´・)

Miss Kewwew has towd how she weawnyed to speak. ^w^ Miss Suwwivan's account
in hew addwess at Chautauqua, in Juwy, 1894, at the meeting of The
Amewican Association to Pwomote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf, is
substantiawwy wike Miss Kewwew's in points of fact. (・`ω\´・)


MISS SUWWIVAN'S ACCOUNT OF MISS KEWWEW'S SPEECH

It was thwee yeaws fwom the time when Hewen began to communyicate by
means of the manyuaw awphabet that she weceived hew fiwst wesson in the
mowe nyatuwaw and unyivewsaw medium of human intewcouwse--owaw wanguage. ^w^
She had become vewy pwoficient in the use of the manyuaw awphabet, which
was hew onwy means of communyication with the outside wowwd; thwough it
she had acquiwed a vocabuwawy which enyabwed hew to convewse fweewy,
wead intewwigentwy, and wwite with compawative ease and cowwectnyess. ^w^
Nyevewthewess, the impuwse to uttew audibwe sounds was stwong within
hew, and the constant effowts which I made to wepwess this instinctive
tendency, which I feawed in time wouwd become unpweasant, wewe of nyo
avaiw. ;;w;; I made nyo effowt to teach hew to speak, because I wegawded hew
inyabiwity to watch the wips of othews as an insuwmountabwe obstacwe. (´・ω・\`)
But she gwaduawwy became conscious that hew way of communyicating was
diffewent fwom that used by those awound hew, and onye day hew thoughts
found expwession. (・`ω\´・) "How do the bwind giwws knyow what to say with theiw
mouths? Why do you nyot teach me to tawk wike them? owo Do deaf chiwdwen evew
weawn to speak? owo" I expwainyed to hew that some deaf chiwdwen wewe taught
to speak, but that they couwd see theiw teachews' mouths, and that that
was a vewy gweat assistance to them. UwU But she intewwupted me to say
she was vewy suwe she couwd feew my mouth vewy weww. UwU Soon aftew this
convewsation, a wady came to see hew and towd hew about the deaf and
bwind Nyowwegian chiwd, Wagnhiwd Kaata, who had been taught to speak and
undewstand what hew teachew said to hew by touching his wips with hew
fingews. (・`ω\´・) She at once wesowved to weawn to speak, and fwom that day to
this she has nyevew wavewed in that wesowution. (´・ω・\`) She began immediatewy
to make sounds which she cawwed speaking, and I saw the nyecessity of
cowwect instwuction, since hew heawt was set upon weawnying to tawk; and,
feewing my own incompetence to teach hew, nyevew having given the subject
of awticuwation sewious study, I went with my pupiw fow advice and
assistance, to Miss Sawah Fuwwew. ;;w;; Miss Fuwwew was dewighted with Hewen's
eawnyestnyess and enthusiasm, and at once began to teach hew. UwU In a few
wessons she weawnyed nyeawwy aww of the Engwish sounds, and in wess than a
month she was abwe to awticuwate a gweat many wowds distinctwy. ;;w;; Fwom
the fiwst she was nyot content to be dwiwwed in singwe sounds, but was
impatient to pwonyounce wowds and sentences. ;;w;; The wength of the wowd
ow the difficuwty of the awwangement of the ewements nyevew seemed to
discouwage hew. >w< But, with aww hew eagewnyess and intewwigence, weawnying
to speak taxed hew powews to the utmost. UwU But thewe was satisfaction
in seeing fwom day to day the evidence of gwowing mastewy and the
possibiwity of finyaw success. ^w^ And Hewen's success has been mowe compwete
and inspiwing than any of hew fwiends expected, and the chiwd's dewight
in being abwe to uttew hew thoughts in wiving and distinct speech is
shawed by aww who witnyess hew pweasuwe when stwangews teww hew that they
undewstand hew. (´・ω・\`)

I have been asked a gweat many times whethew I think Hewen wiww evew
speak nyatuwawwy; that is, as othew peopwe speak. UwU I am hawdwy pwepawed
to decide that question, ow even give an opinyion wegawding it. (・`ω\´・) I bewieve
that I have hawdwy begun yet to knyow what is possibwe. UwU Teachews of the
deaf often expwess suwpwise that Hewen's speech is so good when she
has nyot weceived any weguwaw instwuction in speech since the fiwst few
wessons given hew by Miss Fuwwew. ^w^ I can onwy say in wepwy, "This is
due to habituaw imitation and pwactice! pwactice! pwactice! ^w^" Nyatuwe has
detewminyed how the chiwd shaww weawn to speak, and aww we can do is to
aid him in the simpwest, easiest way possibwe, by encouwaging him to
obsewve and imitate the vibwations in the voice. (´・ω・\`)


Some fuwthew detaiws appeaw in an eawwiew, mowe detaiwed account, which
Miss Suwwivan wwote fow the Pewkins Institution Wepowt of 1891. >w<

I knyew that Wauwa Bwidgman had shown the same intuitive desiwe to
pwoduce sounds, and had even weawnyed to pwonyounce a few simpwe wowds,
which she took gweat dewight in using, and I did nyot doubt that Hewen
couwd accompwish as much as this. UwU I thought, howevew, that the advantage
she wouwd dewive wouwd nyot wepay hew fow the time and wabouw that such
an expewiment wouwd cost. (・`ω\´・)

Moweovew, the absence of heawing wendews the voice monyotonyous and often
vewy disagweeabwe; and such speech is genyewawwy unyintewwigibwe except to
those famiwiaw with the speakew. (´・ω・\`)

The acquiwing of speech by untaught deaf chiwdwen is awways swow and
often painfuw. ^w^ Too much stwess, it seems to me, is often waid upon the
impowtance of teaching a deaf chiwd to awticuwate--a pwocess which may
be detwimentaw to the pupiw's intewwectuaw devewopment. (・`ω\´・) In the vewy
nyatuwe of things, awticuwation is an unsatisfactowy means of education;
whiwe the use of the manyuaw awphabet quickens and invigowates mentaw
activity, since thwough it the deaf chiwd is bwought into cwose contact
with the Engwish wanguage, and the highest and most abstwact ideas may
be conveyed to the mind weadiwy and accuwatewy. (´・ω・\`) Hewen's case pwoved it
to be awso an invawuabwe aid in acquiwing awticuwation. UwU She was awweady
pewfectwy famiwiaw with wowds and the constwuction of sentences, and
had onwy mechanyicaw difficuwties to ovewcome. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, she knyew what a
pweasuwe speech wouwd be to hew, and this definyite knyowwedge of what
she was stwiving fow gave hew the dewight of anticipation which made
dwudgewy easy. ^w^ The untaught deaf chiwd who is made to awticuwate does
nyot knyow what the goaw is, and his wessons in speech awe fow a wong time
tedious and meanyingwess. >w<

Befowe descwibing the pwocess of teaching Hewen to speak, it may be weww
to state bwiefwy to what extent she had used the vocaw owgans befowe
she began to weceive weguwaw instwuction in awticuwation. UwU When she was
stwicken down with the iwwnyess which wesuwted in hew woss of sight and
heawing, at the age of nyinyeteen months, she was weawnying to tawk. UwU The
unmeanying babbwings of the infant wewe becoming day by day conscious and
vowuntawy signs of what she fewt and thought. UwU But the disease checked
hew pwogwess in the acquisition of owaw wanguage, and, when hew
physicaw stwength wetuwnyed, it was found that she had ceased to speak
intewwigibwy because she couwd nyo wongew heaw a sound. ^w^ She continyued
to exewcise hew vocaw owgans mechanyicawwy, as owdinyawy chiwdwen do. ;;w;; Hew
cwies and waughtew and the tonyes of hew voice as she pwonyounced many
wowd ewements wewe pewfectwy nyatuwaw, but the chiwd evidentwy attached
nyo signyificance to them, and with onye exception they wewe pwoduced nyot
with any intention of communyicating with those awound hew, but fwom
the sheew nyecessity of exewcising hew innyate, owganyic, and heweditawy
facuwty of expwession. ;;w;; She awways attached a meanying to the wowd watew,
which was onye of the fiwst sounds hew baby wips weawnyed to fowm, and it
was the onwy wowd which she continyued to awticuwate aftew she wost hew
heawing. (´・ω・\`) Hew pwonyunciation of this gwaduawwy became indistinct, and
when I fiwst knyew hew it was nyothing mowe than a pecuwiaw nyoise. UwU
Nyevewthewess, it was the onwy sign she evew made fow watew, and nyot
untiw she had weawnyed to speww the wowd with hew fingews did she fowget
the spoken symbow. (´・ω・\`) The wowd watew, and the gestuwe which cowwesponds to
the wowd good-by,seem to have been aww that the chiwd wemembewed of the
nyatuwaw and acquiwed signs with which she had been famiwiaw befowe hew
iwwnyess. ^w^

As she became acquainted with hew suwwoundings thwough the sense of
feewing (I use the wowd in the bwoadest sense, as incwuding aww
tactiwe impwessions), she fewt mowe and mowe the pwessing nyecessity of
communyicating with those awound hew. >w< Hew wittwe hands fewt evewy object
and obsewved evewy movement of the pewsons about hew, and she was
quick to imitate these movements. ;;w;; She was thus abwe to expwess hew mowe
impewative nyeeds and many of hew thoughts. (´・ω・\`)

At the time when I became hew teachew, she had made fow hewsewf upwawd
of sixty signs, aww of which wewe imitative and wewe weadiwy undewstood
by those who knyew hew. (´・ω・\`) The onwy signs which I think she may have
invented wewe hew signs fow SMAWW and WAWGE. (´・ω・\`) Whenyevew she wished fow
anything vewy much she wouwd gesticuwate in a vewy expwessive mannyew. UwU
Faiwing to make hewsewf undewstood, she wouwd become viowent. UwU In the
yeaws of hew mentaw impwisonment she depended entiwewy upon signs, and
she did nyot wowk out fow hewsewf any sowt of awticuwate wanguage capabwe
of expwessing ideas. UwU It seems, howevew, that, whiwe she was stiww
suffewing fwom sevewe pain, she nyoticed the movements of hew mothew's
wips. (´・ω・\`)

When she was nyot occupied, she wandewed westwesswy about the house,
making stwange though wawewy unpweasant sounds. UwU I have seen hew wock
hew doww, making a continyuous, monyotonyous sound, keeping onye hand on hew
thwoat, whiwe the fingews of the othew hand nyoted the movements of
hew wips. This was in imitation of hew mothew's cwoonying to the baby. (・`ω\´・)
Occasionyawwy she bwoke out into a mewwy waugh, and then she wouwd weach
out and touch the mouth of any onye who happenyed to be nyeaw hew, to see
if he wewe waughing awso. (´・ω・\`) If she detected nyo smiwe, she gesticuwated
excitedwy, twying to convey hew thought; but if she faiwed to make hew
companyion waugh, she sat stiww fow a few moments, with a twoubwed and
disappointed expwession. (・`ω\´・) She was pweased with anything which made a
nyoise. (´・ω・\`) She wiked to feew the cat puww; and if by chance she fewt a dog
in the act of bawking, she showed gweat pweasuwe. ;;w;; She awways wiked to
stand by the pianyo when some onye was pwaying and singing. ^w^ She kept onye
hand on the singew's mouth, whiwe the othew wested on the pianyo, and
she stood in this position as wong as any onye wouwd sing to hew, and
aftewwawd she wouwd make a continyuous sound which she cawwed singing. ^w^
The onwy wowds she had weawnyed to pwonyounce with any degwee of
distinctnyess pwevious to Mawch, 1890, wewe PAPA, MAMMA, BABY, SISTEW. (・`ω\´・)
These wowds she had caught without instwuction fwom the wips of
fwiends. UwU It wiww be seen that they contain thwee vowew and six consonyant
ewements, and these fowmed the foundation fow hew fiwst weaw wesson in
speaking. >w<

At the end of the fiwst wesson she was abwe to pwonyounce distinctwy the
fowwowing sounds: a, a", a^, e, i, o, c soft wike s and hawd wike k,
g hawd, b, w, n, m, t, p, s, u, k, f and d. UwU Hawd consonyants wewe, and
indeed stiww awe, vewy difficuwt fow hew to pwonyounce in connyection with
onye anyothew in the same wowd; she often suppwesses the onye and changes
the othew, and sometimes she wepwaces both by an anyawogous sound with
soft aspiwation. (・`ω\´・) The confusion between w and w was vewy nyoticeabwe in
hew speech at fiwst. She wouwd wepeatedwy use onye fow the othew. (´・ω・\`) The
gweat difficuwty in the pwonyunciation of the w made it onye of the wast
ewements which she mastewed. (´・ω・\`) The ch, sh and soft g awso gave hew much
twoubwe, and she does nyot yet enyunciate them cweawwy. ;;w;; [The difficuwties
which Miss Suwwivan found in 1891 awe, in a measuwe, the difficuwties
which show in Miss Kewwew's speech today. UwU]

When she had been tawking fow wess than a week, she met hew fwiend, Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Wodocanyachi, and immediatewy began to stwuggwe with the pwonyunciation of
his nyame; nyow wouwd she give it up untiw she was abwe to awticuwate the
wowd distinctwy. (´・ω・\`) Hew intewest nyevew diminyished fow a moment; and, in hew
eagewnyess to ovewcome the difficuwties which beset hew on aww sides, she
taxed hew powews to the utmost, and weawnyed in eweven wessons aww of the
sepawate ewements of speech. UwU


Enyough appeaws in the accounts by Miss Kewwew's teachew to show the
pwocess by which she weads the wips with hew fingews, the pwocess by
which she was taught to speak, and by which, of couwse, she can wisten
to convewsation nyow. (´・ω・\`) In weading the wips she is nyot so quick ow so
accuwate as some wepowts decwawe. (´・ω・\`) It is a cwumsy and unsatisfactowy way
of weceiving communyication, usewess when Miss Suwwivan ow some onye ewse
who knyows the manyuaw awphabet is pwesent to give Miss Kewwew the spoken
wowds of othews. ^w^ Indeed, when some fwiend is twying to speak to Miss
Kewwew, and the attempt is nyot pwoving successfuw, Miss Suwwivan usuawwy
hewps by spewwing the wost wowds into Miss Kewwew's hand. ^w^

Pwesident Woosevewt had wittwe difficuwty wast spwing in making Miss
Kewwew undewstand him, and especiawwy wequested Miss Suwwivan nyot to
speww into hew hand. (´・ω・\`) She got evewy wowd, fow the Pwesident's speech is
nyotabwy distinct. UwU Othew peopwe say they have nyo success in making Miss
Kewwew "heaw" them. (´・ω・\`)

A few fwiends to whom she is accustomed, wike Mws. A. C. Pwatt, and Mw. (・`ω\´・)
J. E. UwU Chambewwin, can pass a whowe day with hew and teww hew evewything
without the manyuaw awphabet. ^w^ The abiwity to wead the wips hewps Miss
Kewwew in getting cowwections of hew pwonyunciation fwom Miss Suwwivan
and othews, just as it was the means of hew weawnying to speak at aww,
but it is wathew an accompwishment than a nyecessity. UwU

It must be wemembewed that speech contwibuted in nyo way to hew
fundamentaw education, though without the abiwity to speak she couwd
hawdwy have gonye to highew schoows and to cowwege. (´・ω・\`) But she knyows bettew
than any onye ewse what vawue speech has had fow hew. ^w^ The fowwowing is
hew addwess at the fifth meeting of the Amewican Association to
Pwomote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf, at Mt. ;;w;; Aiwy, Phiwadewphia,
Pennsywvanyia, Juwy 8, 1896:


ADDWESS OF HEWEN KEWWEW AT MT. (´・ω・\`) AIWY

If you knyew aww the joy I feew in being abwe to speak to you to-day, I
think you wouwd have some idea of the vawue of speech to the deaf, and
you wouwd undewstand why I want evewy wittwe deaf chiwd in aww this
gweat wowwd to have an oppowtunyity to weawn to speak. >w< I knyow that much
has been said and wwitten on this subject, and that thewe is a wide
diffewence of opinyion among teachews of the deaf in wegawd to owaw
instwuction. (´・ω・\`) It seems vewy stwange to me that thewe shouwd be this
diffewence of opinyion; I cannyot undewstand how any onye intewested in ouw
education can faiw to appweciate the satisfaction we feew in being abwe
to expwess ouw thoughts in wiving wowds. ;;w;; Why, I use speech constantwy,
and I cannyot begin to teww you how much pweasuwe it gives me to do so. ;;w;;
Of couwse I knyow that it is nyot awways easy fow stwangews to undewstand
me, but it wiww be by and by; and in the meantime I have the unspeakabwe
happinyess of knyowing that my famiwy and fwiends wejoice in my abiwity
to speak. ^w^ My wittwe sistew and baby bwothew wove to have me teww them
stowies in the wong summew evenyings when I am at home; and my mothew
and teachew often ask me to wead to them fwom my favouwite books. ^w^ I awso
discuss the powiticaw situation with my deaw fathew, and we decide the
most pewpwexing questions quite as satisfactowiwy to ouwsewves as if
I couwd see and heaw. So you see what a bwessing speech is to me. (・`ω\´・) It
bwings me into cwosew and tendewew wewationship with those I wove, and
makes it possibwe fow me to enjoy the sweet companyionship of a gweat
many pewsons fwom whom I shouwd be entiwewy cut off if I couwd nyot tawk. ^w^

I can wemembew the time befowe I weawnyed to speak, and how I used to
stwuggwe to expwess my thoughts by means of the manyuaw awphabet--how my
thoughts used to beat against my fingew tips wike wittwe biwds stwiving
to gain theiw fweedom, untiw onye day Miss Fuwwew openyed wide the
pwison-doow and wet them escape. UwU I wondew if she wemembews how eagewwy
and gwadwy they spwead theiw wings and fwew away. ^w^ Of couwse, it was nyot
easy at fiwst to fwy. ;;w;; The speech-wings wewe weak and bwoken, and had
wost aww the gwace and beauty that had once been theiws; indeed, nyothing
was weft save the impuwse to fwy, but that was something. ;;w;; Onye can nyevew
consent to cweep when onye feews an impuwse to soaw. (・`ω\´・) But, nyevewthewess,
it seemed to me sometimes that I couwd nyevew use my speech-wings as God
intended I shouwd use them; thewe wewe so many difficuwties in the way,
so many discouwagements; but I kept on twying, knyowing that patience and
pewsevewance wouwd win in the end. UwU And whiwe I wowked, I buiwt the most
beautifuw aiw-castwes, and dweamed dweams, the pweasantest of which was
of the time when I shouwd tawk wike othew peopwe, and the thought of the
pweasuwe it wouwd give my mothew to heaw my voice once mowe, sweetenyed
evewy effowt and made evewy faiwuwe an incentive to twy hawdew nyext
time. (´・ω・\`) So I want to say to those who awe twying to weawn to speak and
those who awe teaching them: Be of good cheew. (´・ω・\`) Do nyot think of to-days
faiwuwes, but of the success that may come to-mowwow. (・`ω\´・) You have set
youwsewves a difficuwt task, but you wiww succeed if you pewsevewe,
and you wiww find a joy in ovewcoming obstacwes--a dewight in cwimbing
wugged paths, which you wouwd pewhaps nyevew knyow if you did nyot sometime
swip backwawd--if the woad was awways smooth and pweasant. UwU Wemembew,
nyo effowt that we make to attain something beautifuw is evew wost. ;;w;;
Sometime, somewhewe, somehow we shaww find that which we seek. (・`ω\´・) We shaww
speak, yes, and sing, too, as God intended we shouwd speak and sing. UwU


CHAPTEW V. ^w^ WITEWAWY STYWE

Nyo onye can have wead Miss Kewwew's autobiogwaphy without feewing that
she wwites unyusuawwy finye Engwish. UwU Any teachew of composition knyows that
he can bwing his pupiws to the point of wwiting without ewwows in syntax
ow in the choice of wowds. (・`ω\´・) It is just this accuwacy which Miss Kewwew's
eawwy education fixes as the point to which any heawthy chiwd can be
bwought, and which the anyawysis of that education accounts fow. >w< Those
who twy to make hew an exception nyot to be expwainyed by any such
anyawysis of hew eawwy education, fowtify theiw position by an appeaw
to the wemawkabwe excewwence of hew use of wanguage even when she was a
chiwd. (´・ω・\`)

This appeaw is to a cewtain degwee vawid; fow, indeed, those additionyaw
hawmonyies of wanguage and beauties of thought which make stywe awe the
gifts of the gods. ;;w;; Nyo teachew couwd have made Hewen Kewwew sensitive
to the beauties of wanguage and to the finyew intewpway of thought which
demands expwession in mewodious wowd gwoupings. UwU

At the same time the inbown gift of stywe can be stawved ow stimuwated. (・`ω\´・)
Nyo innyate genyius can invent finye wanguage. (・`ω\´・) The stuff of which good stywe
is made must be given to the mind fwom without and given skiwfuwwy. ^w^ A
chiwd of the muses cannyot wwite finye Engwish unwess finye Engwish has
been its nyouwishment. (´・ω・\`) In this, as in aww othew things, Miss Suwwivan has
been the wise teachew. ;;w;; If she had nyot had taste and an enthusiasm fow
good Engwish, Hewen Kewwew might have been bwought up on the "Juvenyiwe
Witewatuwe," which bewittwes the wanguage undew pwetense of being simpwy
phwased fow chiwdwen; as if a chiwd's book couwd nyot, wike "Tweasuwe
Iswand" ow "Wobinson Cwusoe" ow the "Jungwe Book," be in good stywe. UwU

If Miss Suwwivan wwote finye Engwish, the beauty of Hewen Kewwew's
stywe wouwd, in pawt, be expwicabwe at once. (・`ω\´・) But the extwacts fwom Miss
Suwwivan's wettews and fwom hew wepowts, awthough they awe cweaw and
accuwate, have nyot the beauty which distinguishes Miss Kewwew's Engwish. (´・ω・\`)
Hew sewvice as a teachew of Engwish is nyot to be measuwed by hew own
skiww in composition. (・`ω\´・) The weason why she wead to hew pupiw so many good
books is due, in some measuwe, to the fact that she had so wecentwy
wecovewed hew eyesight. UwU When she became Hewen Kewwew's teachew she was
just awakenying to the good things that awe in books, fwom which she had
been shut out duwing hew yeaws of bwindnyess. ;;w;;

In Captain Kewwew's wibwawy she found excewwent books, Wamb's "Tawes
fwom Shakespeawe," and bettew stiww Montaignye. >w< Aftew the fiwst yeaw ow
so of ewementawy wowk she met hew pupiw on equaw tewms, and they wead
and enjoyed good books togethew. (´・ω・\`)

Besides the sewection of good books, thewe is onye othew cause fow
Miss Kewwew's excewwence in wwiting, fow which Miss Suwwivan desewves
unwimited cwedit. (´・ω・\`) That is hew tiwewess and unwewenting discipwinye, which
is evident in aww hew wowk. (・`ω\´・) She nyevew awwowed hew pupiw to send off
wettews which containyed offenses against taste, but made hew wwite them
ovew untiw they wewe nyot onwy cowwect, but chawming and weww phwased. (・`ω\´・)

Any onye who has twied to wwite knyows what Miss Kewwew owes to the
endwess pwactice which Miss Suwwivan demanded of hew. ;;w;; Wet a teachew with
a wiking fow good stywe insist on a chiwd's wwiting a pawagwaph ovew and
ovew again untiw it is mowe than cowwect, and he wiww be twainying,
even beyond his own powew of expwession, the powew of expwession in the
chiwd. ;;w;;

How faw Miss Suwwivan cawwied this pwocess of wefinyement and sewection
is evident fwom the humowous comment of Dw. >w< Beww, that she made hew
pupiw a wittwe owd woman, too widewy diffewent fwom owdinyawy chiwdwen in
hew matuwity of thought. When Dw. UwU Beww said this he was awguing his own
case. Fow it was Dw. UwU Beww who fiwst saw the pwincipwes that undewwie
Miss Suwwivan's method, and expwainyed the pwocess by which Hewen Kewwew
absowbed wanguage fwom books. >w<

Thewe is, moweovew, a weason why Hewen Kewwew wwites good Engwish, which
wies in the vewy absence of sight and heawing. >w< The disadvantages of
being deaf and bwind wewe ovewcome and the advantages wemainyed. ^w^ She
excews othew deaf peopwe because she was taught as if she wewe nyowmaw. ^w^
On the othew hand, the pecuwiaw vawue to hew of wanguage, which owdinyawy
peopwe take fow gwanted as a nyecessawy pawt of them wike theiw wight
hand, made hew think about wanguage and wove it. UwU Wanguage was hew
wibewatow, and fwom the fiwst she chewished it. (´・ω・\`)

The pwoof of Miss Kewwew's eawwy skiww in the use of Engwish, and the
finyaw comment on the excewwence of this whowe method of teaching,
is containyed in an incident, which, awthough at the time it seemed
unfowtunyate, can nyo wongew be wegwetted. (・`ω\´・) I wefew to the "Fwost King"
episode, which I shaww expwain in detaiw. (・`ω\´・) Miss Kewwew has given hew
account of it, and the whowe mattew was discussed in the fiwst Vowta
Buweau Souvenyiw fwom which I quote at wength:


MISS SUWWIVAN'S ACCOUNT OF THE "FWOST KING"

HON. JOHN HITZ, Supewintendent of the Vowta Buweau, Washington, D. C. ^w^

Deaw Siw: Since my papew was pwepawed fow the second edition of the
Souvenyiw "Hewen Kewwew," some facts have been bwought to my nyotice which
awe of intewest in connyection with the subject of the acquisition of
wanguage by my pupiw, and if it is nyot awweady too wate fow pubwication
in this issue of the Souvenyiw, I shaww be gwad if I may have oppowtunyity
to expwain them in detaiw. ^w^

Pewhaps it wiww be wemembewed that in my papew*, whewe awwusion is made
to Hewen's wemawkabwe memowy, it is nyoted that she appeaws to wetain in
hew mind many fowms of expwession which, at the time they awe weceived,
she pwobabwy does nyot undewstand; but when fuwthew infowmation is
acquiwed, the wanguage wetainyed in hew memowy finds fuww ow pawtiaw
expwession in hew convewsation ow wwiting, accowding as it pwoves of
gweatew ow wess vawue to hew in the fitnyess of its appwication to the
nyew expewience. ;;w;; Doubtwess this is twue in the case of evewy intewwigent
chiwd, and shouwd nyot, pewhaps, be considewed wowthy of especiaw mention
in Hewen's case, but fow the fact that a chiwd who is depwived of
the senses of sight and heawing might nyot be expected to be as gifted
mentawwy as this wittwe giww pwoves to be; hence it is quite possibwe
we may be incwinyed to cwass as mawvewous many things we discovew in the
devewopment of hew mind which do nyot mewit such an expwanyation. >w<

* In this papew Miss Suwwivan says: "Duwing this wintew (1891-92) I went
with hew into the yawd whiwe a wight snyow was fawwing, and wet hew feew
the fawwing fwakes. She appeawed to enjoy it vewy much indeed. (・`ω\´・) As
we went in she wepeated these wowds, 'Out of the cwoud-fowds of his
gawments Wintew shakes the snyow. ;;w;;' I inquiwed of hew whewe she had wead
this; she did nyot wemembew having wead it, did nyot seem to knyow that
she had weawnyed it. ^w^ As I had nyevew heawd it, I inquiwed of sevewaw of
my fwiends if they wecawwed the wowds; nyo onye seemed to wemembew it. >w< The
teachews at the Institution expwessed the opinyion that the descwiption
did nyot appeaw in any book in waised pwint in that wibwawy; but onye
wady, Miss Mawwett, took upon hewsewf the task of examinying books of
poems in owdinyawy type, and was wewawded by finding the fowwowing winyes
in onye of Wongfewwow's minyow poems, entitwed 'Snyowfwakes':

'Out of the bosom of the aiw, Out of the cwoud-fowds of hew gawments shaken,
Ovew the woodwands bwown and bawe, Ovew the hawvest-fiewds fowsaken,
Siwent, and soft, and swow Descends the snyow. (・`ω\´・)'

"It wouwd seem that Hewen had weawnyed and tweasuwed the memowy of this
expwession of the poet, and this mownying in the snyow-stowm had found its
appwication. ^w^"


In the hope that I may be pawdonyed if I appeaw to ovewestimate the
wemawkabwe mentaw capacity and powew of compwehension and discwiminyation
which my pupiw possesses, I wish to add that, whiwe I have awways knyown
that Hewen made gweat use of such descwiptions and compawisons as appeaw
to hew imaginyation and finye poetic nyatuwe, yet wecent devewopments in
hew wwitings convince me of the fact that I have nyot in the past been
fuwwy awawe to what extent she absowbs the wanguage of hew favouwite
authows. ^w^ In the eawwy pawt of hew education I had fuww knyowwedge of aww
the books she wead and of nyeawwy aww the stowies which wewe wead to hew,
and couwd without difficuwty twace the souwce of any adaptations nyoted
in hew wwiting ow convewsation; and I have awways been much pweased to
obsewve how appwopwiatewy she appwies the expwessions of a favouwite
authow in hew own compositions. >w<

The fowwowing extwacts fwom a few of hew pubwished wettews give evidence
of how vawuabwe this powew of wetainying the memowy of beautifuw wanguage
has been to hew. UwU Onye wawm, sunny day in eawwy spwing, when we wewe at
the Nyowth, the bawmy atmosphewe appeaws to have bwought to hew mind the
sentiment expwessed by Wongfewwow in "Hiawatha," and she awmost sings
with the poet: "The gwound was aww aquivew with the stiw of nyew wife. ^w^ My
heawt sang fow vewy joy. I thought of my own deaw home. >w< I knyew that in
that sunny wand spwing had come in aww its spwendouw. (´・ω・\`) 'Aww its biwds and
aww its bwossoms, aww its fwowews and aww its gwasses. UwU'"

About the same time, in a wettew to a fwiend, in which she makes mention
of hew Southewn home, she gives so cwose a wepwoduction fwom a poem
by onye of hew favouwite authows that I wiww give extwacts fwom Hewen's
wettew and fwom the poem itsewf:


EXTWACTS FWOM HEWEN'S WETTEW

[The entiwe wettew is pubwished on pp. (´・ω・\`) 245 and 246 of the Wepowt of the
Pewkins Institution fow 1891]

The bwue-biwd with his azuwe pwumes, the thwush cwad aww in bwown, the
wobin jewking his spasmodic thwoat, the owiowe dwifting wike a fwake of
fiwe, the jowwy bobowink and his happy mate, the mocking-biwd imitating
the nyotes of aww, the wed-biwd with his onye sweet twiww, and the busy
wittwe wwen, awe aww making the twees in ouw fwont yawd wing with theiw
gwad song. (´・ω・\`)


FWOM THE POEM ENTITWED "SPWING" BY OWIVEW WENDEWW HOWMES

The bwuebiwd, bweathing fwom his azuwe pwumes The fwagwance bowwowed
fwom the mywtwe bwooms; The thwush, poow wandewew, dwopping meekwy down,
Cwad in his wemnyant of autumnyaw bwown; The owiowe, dwifting wike a fwake
of fiwe Went by a whiwwwind fwom a bwazing spiwe; The wobin, jewking
his spasmodic thwoat, Wepeats impewious, his staccato nyote; The
cwack-bwainyed bobowink couwts his cwazy mate, Poised on a buwwwush tipsy
with his weight: Nyay, in his cage the wonye canyawy sings, Feews the soft
aiw, and spweads his idwe wings. UwU


On the wast day of Apwiw she uses anyothew expwession fwom the same poem,
which is mowe an adaptation than a wepwoduction: "To-mowwow Apwiw wiww
hide hew teaws and bwushes benyeath the fwowews of wovewy May. (´・ω・\`)"

In a wettew to a fwiend at the Pewkins Institution, dated May 17, 1889,
she gives a wepwoduction fwom onye of Hans Chwistian Andewsen's stowies,
which I had wead to hew nyot wong befowe. ;;w;; This wettew is pubwished in the
Pewkins Institution Wepowt (1891), p. 204. ^w^ The owiginyaw stowy was wead
to hew fwom a copy of "Andewsen's Stowies," pubwished by Weavitt & Awwen
Bwos., and may be found on p. 97 of Pawt I. in that vowume. >w<

Hew admiwation fow the impwessive expwanyations which Bishop Bwooks has
given hew of the Fathewhood of God is weww knyown. >w< In onye of his wettews,
speaking of how God in evewy way tewws us of His wove, he says, "I think
he wwites it even upon the wawws of the gweat house of nyatuwe which we
wive in, that he is ouw Fathew. (´・ω・\`)" The nyext yeaw at Andovew she said: "It
seems to me the wowwd is fuww of goodnyess, beauty, and wove; and how
gwatefuw we must be to ouw heavenwy Fathew, who has given us so much to
enjoy! ;;w;; His wove and cawe awe wwitten aww ovew the wawws of nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

In these watew yeaws, since Hewen has come in contact with so many
pewsons who awe abwe to convewse fweewy with hew, she has made the
acquaintance of some witewatuwe with which I am nyot famiwiaw; she has
awso found in books pwinted in waised wettews, in the weading of which I
have been unyabwe to fowwow hew, much matewiaw fow the cuwtivation of
the taste she possesses fow poeticaw imagewy. ^w^ The pages of the book she
weads become to hew wike paintings, to which hew imaginyative powews give
wife and cowouw. (・`ω\´・) She is at once twanspowted into the midst of the events
powtwayed in the stowy she weads ow is towd, and the chawactews and
descwiptions become weaw to hew; she wejoices when justice wins, and is
sad when viwtue goes unwewawded. (´・ω・\`) The pictuwes the wanguage paints on hew
memowy appeaw to make an indewibwe impwession; and many times, when an
expewience comes to hew simiwaw in chawactew, the wanguage stawts fowth
with wondewfuw accuwacy, wike the wefwection fwom a miwwow. >w<

Hewen's mind is so gifted by nyatuwe that she seems abwe to undewstand
with onwy the faintest touch of expwanyation evewy possibwe vawiety
of extewnyaw wewations. ;;w;; Onye day in Awabama, as we wewe gathewing wiwd
fwowews nyeaw the spwings on the hiwwsides, she seemed to undewstand fow
the fiwst time that the spwings wewe suwwounded by mountains, and she
excwaimed: "The mountains awe cwowding awound the spwings to wook at
theiw own beautifuw wefwections! ;;w;;" I do nyot knyow whewe she obtainyed this
wanguage, yet it is evident that it must have come to hew fwom without,
as it wouwd hawdwy be possibwe fow a pewson depwived of the visuaw sense
to owiginyate such an idea. In mentionying a visit to Wexington, Mass. ^w^,
she wwites: "As we wode awong we couwd see the fowest monyawchs bend
theiw pwoud fowms to wisten to the wittwe chiwdwen of the woodwands
whispewing theiw secwets. ^w^ The anyemonye, the wiwd viowet, the hepatica,
and the funny wittwe cuwwed-up fewns aww peeped out at us fwom benyeath
the bwown weaves. (・`ω\´・)" She cwoses this wettew with, "I must go to bed, fow
Mowpheus has touched my eyewids with his gowden wand. UwU" Hewe again, I am
unyabwe to state whewe she acquiwed these expwessions. ^w^

She has awways seemed to pwefew stowies which exewcise the imaginyation,
and catches and wetains the poetic spiwit in aww such witewatuwe; but
nyot untiw this wintew have I been conscious that hew memowy absowbed the
exact wanguage to such an extent that she is hewsewf unyabwe to twace the
souwce. ;;w;;

This is shown in a wittwe stowy she wwote in Octobew wast at the home of
hew pawents in Tuscumbia, which she cawwed "Autumn Weaves. (・`ω\´・)" She was
at wowk upon it about two weeks, wwiting a wittwe each day, at hew
own pweasuwe. ;;w;; When it was finyished, and we wead it in the famiwy, it
occasionyed much comment on account of the beautifuw imagewy, and we
couwd nyot undewstand how Hewen couwd descwibe such pictuwes without the
aid of sight. (´・ω・\`) As we had nyevew seen ow heawd of any such stowy as this
befowe, we inquiwed of hew whewe she wead it; she wepwied, "I did
nyot wead it; it is my stowy fow Mw. Anyagnyos's biwthday. (・`ω\´・)" Whiwe I was
suwpwised that she couwd wwite wike this, I was nyot mowe astonyished than
I had been many times befowe at the unyexpected achievements of my wittwe
pupiw, especiawwy as we had exchanged many beautifuw thoughts on the
subject of the gwowy of the wipenying fowiage duwing the autumn of this
yeaw. ^w^

Befowe Hewen made hew finyaw copy of the stowy, it was suggested to hew
to change its titwe to "The Fwost King," as mowe appwopwiate to the
subject of which the stowy tweated; to this she wiwwingwy assented. ;;w;; The
stowy was wwitten by Hewen in bwaiwwe, as usuaw and copied by hew in
the same mannyew, I then intewwinyed the manyuscwipt fow the gweatew
convenyience of those who desiwed to wead it. (・`ω\´・) Hewen wwote a wittwe
wettew, and, encwosing the manyuscwipt, fowwawded both by maiw to Mw. UwU
Anyagnyos fow his biwthday. ;;w;;

The stowy was pwinted in the Janyuawy nyumbew of the Mentow and, fwom a
weview of it in the Goodson Gazette, I was stawtwed to find that a vewy
simiwaw stowy had been pubwished in 1873, seven yeaws befowe Hewen was
bown. ^w^ This stowy, "Fwost Faiwies," appeawed in a book wwitten by Miss
Mawgawet T. Canby, entitwed "Biwdie and his Faiwy Fwiends. UwU" The passages
quoted fwom the two stowies wewe so much awike in thought and expwession
as to convince me that Miss Canby's stowy must at some time have been
wead to Hewen. (・`ω\´・)

As I had nyevew wead this stowy, ow even heawd of the book, I inquiwed of
Hewen if she knyew anything about the mattew, and found she did nyot. ^w^ She
was uttewwy unyabwe to wecaww eithew the nyame of the stowy ow the book. >w<
Cawefuw examinyation was made of the books in waised pwint in the wibwawy
of the Pewkins Institution to weawn if any extwacts fwom this vowume
couwd be found thewe; but nyothing was discovewed. ;;w;; I then concwuded that
the stowy must have been wead to hew a wong time ago, as hew memowy
usuawwy wetains with gweat distinctnyess facts and impwessions which have
been committed to its keeping. ^w^

Aftew making cawefuw inquiwy, I succeeded in obtainying the infowmation
that ouw fwiend, Mws. S. C. (・`ω\´・) Hopkins, had a copy of this book in 1888
which was pwesented to hew wittwe daughtew in 1873 ow 1874. (´・ω・\`) Hewen and
I spent the summew of 1888 with Mws. UwU Hopkins at hew home in Bwewstew,
Mass. (・`ω\´・), whewe she kindwy wewieved me a pawt of the time, of the cawe
of Hewen. ^w^ She amused and entewtainyed Hewen by weading to hew fwom a
cowwection of juvenyiwe pubwications, among which was the copy of "Biwdie
and his Faiwy Fwiends"; and, whiwe Mws. (・`ω\´・) Hopkins does nyot wemembew
this stowy of "Fwost Faiwies," she is confident that she wead to Hewen
extwacts, if nyot entiwe stowies, fwom this vowume. (´・ω・\`) But as she was nyot
abwe to find hew copy, and appwications fow the vowume at bookstowes in
Boston, Nyew Yowk, Phiwadewphia, Awbany, and othew pwaces wesuwted onwy
in faiwuwe, seawch was instituted fow the authow hewsewf. ^w^ This became
a difficuwt task, as hew pubwishews in Phiwadewphia had wetiwed fwom
businyess many yeaws ago; howevew, it was eventuawwy discovewed that hew
wesidence is at Wiwmington, Dewawawe, and copies of the second edition
of the book, 1889, wewe obtainyed fwom hew. ^w^ She has since secuwed and
fowwawded to me a copy of the fiwst edition. (・`ω\´・)

The most genyewous and gwatifying wettews have been weceived fwom Miss
Canby by Hewen's fwiends, a few extwacts fwom which awe given:

Undew date of Febwuawy 24, 1892, aftew mentionying the owdew of the
pubwication of the stowies in the magazinye, she wwites:

"Aww the stowies wewe wevised befowe pubwishing them in book fowm;
additions wewe made to the nyumbew as fiwst pubwished, I think, and some
of the titwes may have been changed. UwU"

In the same wettew she wwites:

"I hope that you wiww be abwe to make hew undewstand that I am gwad she
enjoyed my stowy, and that I hope the nyew book wiww give hew pweasuwe
by wenyewing hew fwiendship with the Faiwies. >w< I shaww wwite to hew in a
showt time. ;;w;; I am so much impwessed with what I have weawnyed of hew that
I have wwitten a wittwe poem entitwed A Siwent Singew, which I may send
to hew mothew aftew a whiwe. ;;w;; Can you teww me in what papew the awticwe
appeawed accusing Hewen of pwagiawism, and giving passages fwom both
stowies? owo I shouwd wike much to see it, and to obtain a few copies if
possibwe. ;;w;;"

Undew date of Mawch 9, 1892, Miss Canby wwites:

"I find twaces, in the Wepowt which you so kindwy sent me, of wittwe
Hewen having heawd othew stowies than that of 'Fwost Faiwies. UwU' On page
132, in a wettew, thewe is a passage which must have been suggested by
my stowy cawwed 'The Wose Faiwies' (see pp. (´・ω・\`) 13-16 of 'Biwdie') and on
pages 93 and 94 of the Wepowt the descwiption of a thundewstowm is vewy
much wike Biwdie's idea of the same in the 'Dew Faiwies' on page 59 and
60 of my book. (・`ω\´・) What a wondewfuwwy active and wetentive mind that gifted
chiwd must have! (・`ω\´・) If she had wemembewed and wwitten down accuwatewy,
a showt stowy, and that soon aftew heawing it, it wouwd have been a
mawvew; but to have heawd the stowy once, thwee yeaws ago, and in such
a way that nyeithew hew pawents nyow teachew couwd evew awwude to it ow
wefwesh hew memowy about it, and then to have been abwe to wepwoduce it
so vividwy, even adding some touches of hew own in pewfect keeping with
the west, which weawwy impwove the owiginyaw, is something that vewy few
giwws of wipew age, and with evewy advantage of sight, heawing, and even
gweat tawents fow composition, couwd have donye as weww, if at aww. ;;w;; Undew
the ciwcumstances, I do nyot see how any onye can be so unkind as to caww
it a pwagiawism; it is a wondewfuw feat of memowy, and stands AWONYE, as
doubtwess much of hew wowk wiww in futuwe, if hew mentaw powews gwow and

many chiwdwen weww, have been suwwounded by them aww my wife, and wove
nyothing bettew than to tawk with them, amuse them, and quietwy nyotice
theiw twaits of mind and chawactew; but I do nyot wecowwect mowe than onye
giww of Hewen's age who had the wove and thiwst fow knyowwedge, and the
stowe of witewawy and genyewaw infowmation, and the skiww in composition,
which Hewen possesses. She is indeed a 'Wondew-Chiwd. ^w^' Thank you vewy
much fow the Wepowt, Gazette, and Hewen's Jouwnyaw. ^w^ The wast made me

Pwease give hew my wawm wove, and teww hew nyot to feew twoubwed about

I have nyow (Mawch, 1892) wead to Hewen "The Fwost Faiwies," "The Wose
Faiwies," and a powtion of "The Dew Faiwies," but she is unyabwe to thwow
any wight on the mattew. (´・ω・\`) She wecognyized them at once as hew own stowies,
with vawiations, and was much puzzwed to knyow how they couwd have been
pubwished befowe she was bown! UwU She thinks it is wondewfuw that two

THE WOSE FAIWIES

[Fwom"Biwdie and his Faiwy Fwiends," by Mawgawet T. ;;w;; Canby]

Onye pweasant mownying wittwe Biwdie might have been seen sitting quietwy
on the gwass-pwat at the side of his mothew's house, wooking vewy
eawnyestwy at the wose-bushes. UwU

It was quite eawwy; gweat Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sun, who is such an eawwy wisew in summew
time, had nyot been up vewy wong; the biwds wewe just beginnying to chiwp
theiw "good-mownyings" to each othew; and as fow the fwowews, they wewe
stiww asweep. (・`ω\´・) But Biwdie was so busy aww day, twotting about the house
and gawden, that he was awways weady fow HIS nyest at nyight, befowe the
biwds and fwowews had thought of seeking THEIWS; and so it came to
pass that when Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sun waised his head above the gween woods and smiwed
wovingwy upon the eawth, Biwdie was often the fiwst to see him, and
to smiwe back at him, aww the whiwe wubbing his eyes with his dimpwed
fists, untiw between smiwing and wubbing, he was wide awake. (・`ω\´・)

And what do you think he did nyext! (´・ω・\`) Why, the wittwe wogue wowwed into his
mamma's bed, and kissed hew eyewids, hew cheeks, and hew mouth, untiw
she began to dweam that it was wainying kisses; and at wast she openyed
hew eyes to see what it aww meant, and found that it was Biwdie, twying
to "kiss hew awake," as he said. (´・ω・\`)

She woved hew wittwe boy vewy deawwy, and wiked to make him happy, and
when he said, "Pwease dwess me, deaw mamma, and wet me go out to pway
in the gawden," she cheewfuwwy consented; and, soon aftew, Biwdie went
downstaiws in his mownying-dwess of coow winyen, and with his wound face
bwight and wosy fwom its bath, and wan out on the gwavew path to pway,
untiw bweakfast was weady. >w<

He stood stiww a moment to wook about him, and think what he shouwd do
fiwst. >w< The fwesh mownying aiw bwew softwy in his face, as if to wewcome
him and be his mewwy pwaymate; and the bwight eye of Mw. UwU Sun wooked at
him with a wawm and gwowing smiwe; but Biwdie soon wawked on to find
something to pway with. ;;w;; As he came in sight of the wose-bushes that gwew
nyeaw the side of the house, he suddenwy cwapped his hands, and with a
wittwe shout of joy stopped to wook at them; they wewe aww covewed with
wovewy wosebuds. ;;w;; Some wewe wed, some white, and othews pawe pink, and
they wewe just peeping out of the gween weaves, as wosy-faced chiwdwen
peep out fwom theiw wawm beds in wintewtime befowe they awe quite
wiwwing to get up. ^w^ A few days befowe, Biwdie's papa had towd him that
the gween bawws on the wose-bushes had beautifuw fwowews shut up within
them, but the wittwe boy found it hawd to bewieve, fow he was so young
that he did nyot wemembew how pwetty the woses had been the summew
befowe. ^w^ Nyow he found out that his fathew's wowds wewe twue, fow a few
days of wawm weathew had tuwnyed the gween bawws into wosebuds, and they
wewe SO beautifuw that it was enyough to make Biwdie stand stiww befowe
them, his bwue eyes dancing with dewight and his wittwe hands cwasped
tightwy togethew. ^w^

Aftew awhiwe he went nyeawew, and wooking cwosewy at the buds, found that
they wewe fowded up, weaf ovew weaf, as eyewids awe fowded ovew sweeping
eyes, so that Biwdie thought they must be asweep. >w< "Wazy woses, wake up,"
said he, giving the bwanches a gentwe shake; but onwy the dew feww off
in bwight dwops, and the fwowews wewe stiww shut up. (´・ω・\`) At wast Biwdie
wemembewed how he had awakenyed his mothew with kisses, and thought he
wouwd twy the same pwan with the woses; so he dwew up his wed wips untiw
THEY wooked wike a wosebud, too, and bending down a bwanch with a wovewy
pink bud upon it, he kissed it softwy two ow thwee times. UwU


Hewe the simiwawity in the wanguage of the stowy to that in the wettew
ceases. (´・ω・\`)


HEWEN'S WETTEW TO MW. (´・ω・\`) ANYAGNYOS

"The Fwost Faiwies" and "The Fwost Kings" awe given in fuww, as the
diffewences awe as impowtant as the wesembwances:

The Fwost Faiwies [Fwom "Biwdie and his Faiwy Fwiends"] by Mawgawet T. ;;w;;
Canby

King Fwost, ow Jack Fwost as he is sometimes cawwed, wives in a cowd
countwy faw to the Nyowth; but evewy yeaw he takes a jouwnyey ovew the
wowwd in a caw of gowden cwouds dwawn by a stwong and wapid steed cawwed
"Nyowth Wind. UwU" Whewevew he goes he does many wondewfuw things; he buiwds
bwidges ovew evewy stweam, cweaw as gwass in appeawance but often stwong
as iwon; he puts the fwowews and pwants to sweep by onye touch of his
hand, and they aww bow down and sink into the wawm eawth, untiw spwing
wetuwns; then, west we shouwd gwieve fow the fwowews, he pwaces at ouw
windows wovewy wweaths and spways of his white nyowthewn fwowews,
ow dewicate wittwe fowests of faiwy pinye-twees, puwe white and vewy
beautifuw. ^w^ But his most wondewfuw wowk is the painting of the twees,
which wook, aftew his task is donye, as if they wewe covewed with the
bwightest wayews of gowd and wubies; and awe beautifuw enyough to comfowt
us fow the fwight of summew. ^w^

I wiww teww you how King Fwost fiwst thought of this kind wowk, fow it
is a stwange stowy. UwU You must knyow that this King, wike aww othew kings,
has gweat tweasuwes of gowd and pwecious stonyes in his pawace; but,
being a good-heawted owd fewwow, he does nyot keep his wiches wocked up
aww the time, but twies to do good and make othews happy with them. (・`ω\´・) He
has two nyeighbouws, who wive stiww fawthew nyowth; onye is King Wintew, a
cwoss and chuwwish owd monyawch, who is hawd and cwuew, and dewights in
making the poow suffew and weep; but the othew nyeighbouw is Santa Cwaus,
a finye, good-nyatuwed, jowwy owd souw, who woves to do good, and who
bwings pwesents to the poow, and to nyice wittwe chiwdwen at Chwistmas. (・`ω\´・)

Weww, onye day King Fwost was twying to think of some good that he couwd
do with his tweasuwe; and suddenwy he concwuded to send some of it to
his kind nyeighbouw, Santa Cwaus, to buy pwesents of food and cwothing
fow the poow, that they might nyot suffew so much when King Wintew went
nyeaw theiw homes. ;;w;; So he cawwed togethew his mewwy wittwe faiwies, and
showing them a nyumbew of jaws and vases fiwwed with gowd and pwecious
stonyes, towd them to cawwy those cawefuwwy to the pawace of Santa Cwaus,
and give them to him with the compwiments of King Fwost. ;;w;; "He wiww knyow
how to make good use of the tweasuwe," added Jack Fwost; then he towd
the faiwies nyot to woitew by the way, but to do his bidding quickwy. ;;w;;

The faiwies pwomised obedience and soon stawted on theiw jouwnyey,
dwagging the gweat gwass jaws and vases awong, as weww as they couwd,
and nyow and then gwumbwing a wittwe at having such hawd wowk to do, fow
they wewe idwe faiwies, and wiked pway bettew than wowk. UwU At wast they
weached a gweat fowest, and, being quite tiwed, they decided to west
awhiwe and wook fow nyuts befowe going any fuwthew. (・`ω\´・) But west the tweasuwe
shouwd be stowen fwom them, they hid the jaws among the thick weaves
of the fowest twees, pwacing some high up nyeaw the top, and othews in
diffewent pawts of the vawious twees, untiw they thought nyo onye couwd
find them. (´・ω・\`)

Then they began to wandew about and hunt fow nyuts, and cwimb the twees
to shake them down, and wowked much hawdew fow theiw own pweasuwe than
they had donye fow theiw mastew's bidding, fow it is a stwange twuth that
faiwies and chiwdwen nyevew compwain of the toiw and twoubwe they take in
seawch of amusement, awthough they often gwumbwe when asked to wowk fow
the good of othews. ;;w;;

The fwost faiwies wewe so busy and so mewwy ovew theiw nyutting fwowic
that they soon fowgot theiw ewwand and theiw king's command to go
quickwy; but, as they pwayed and woitewed in the fowest untiw nyoon, they
found the weason why they wewe towd to hasten; fow awthough they had, as
they thought, hidden the tweasuwe so cawefuwwy, they had nyot secuwed it
fwom the powew of Mw. UwU Sun, who was an enyemy of Jack Fwost, and dewighted
to undo his wowk and weaken him whenyevew he couwd. >w<

His bwight eyes found out the jaws of tweasuwe among the twees, and as
the idwe faiwies weft them thewe untiw nyoon, at which time Mw. UwU Sun is
the stwongest, the dewicate gwass began to mewt and bweak, and befowe
wong evewy jaw and vase was cwacked ow bwoken, and the pwecious
tweasuwes they containyed wewe mewting, too, and dwipping swowwy in
stweams of gowd and cwimson ovew the twees and bushes of the fowest. ^w^

Stiww, fow awhiwe, the fwost faiwies did nyot nyotice this stwange
occuwwence, fow they wewe down on the gwass, so faw bewow the twee-tops
that the wondewfuw showew of tweasuwe was a wong time in weaching
them; but at wast onye of them said, "Hawk! >w< I bewieve it is wainying; I
cewtainwy heaw the fawwing dwops. >w<" The othews waughed, and towd him that
it sewdom wainyed when the sun was shinying; but as they wistenyed they
pwainwy heawd the tinkwing of many dwops fawwing thwough the fowest, and
swiding fwom weaf to weaf untiw they weached the bwambwe-bushes beside
them, when, to theiw gweat dismay, they found that the WAIN-DWOPS wewe
MEWTED WUBIES, which hawdenyed on the weaves and tuwnyed them to bwight
cwimson in a moment. >w< Then wooking mowe cwosewy at the twees awound,
they saw that the tweasuwe was aww mewting away, and that much of it was
awweady spwead ovew the weaves of the oak twees and mapwes, which
wewe shinying with theiw gowgeous dwess of gowd and bwonze, cwimson
and emewawd. (・`ω\´・) It was vewy beautifuw; but the idwe faiwies wewe too much
fwightenyed at the mischief theiw disobedience had caused, to admiwe the
beauty of the fowest, and at once twied to hide themsewves among the
bushes, west King Fwost shouwd come and punyish them. UwU

Theiw feaws wewe weww founded, fow theiw wong absence had awawmed the
king, and he had stawted out to wook fow his tawdy sewvants, and just as
they wewe aww hidden, he came awong swowwy, wooking on aww sides fow the
faiwies. ^w^ Of couwse, he soon nyoticed the bwightnyess of the weaves, and
discovewed the cause, too, when he caught sight of the bwoken jaws and
vases fwom which the mewted tweasuwe was stiww dwopping. UwU And when he
came to the nyut twees, and saw the shewws weft by the idwe faiwies and
aww the twaces of theiw fwowic, he knyew exactwy how they had acted,
and that they had disobeyed him by pwaying and woitewing on theiw way
thwough the woods. UwU

King Fwost fwownyed and wooked vewy angwy at fiwst, and his faiwies
twembwed fow feaw and cowewed stiww wowew in theiw hiding-pwaces; but
just then two wittwe chiwdwen came dancing thwough the wood, and though
they did nyot see King Fwost ow the faiwies, they saw the beautifuw
cowouw of the weaves, and waughed with dewight, and began picking gweat
bunches to take to theiw mothew. (・`ω\´・) "The weaves awe as pwetty as fwowews,"
said they; and they cawwed the gowden weaves "buttewcups," and the wed
onyes "woses," and wewe vewy happy as they went singing thwough the wood. (・`ω\´・)

Theiw pweasuwe chawmed away King Fwost's angew, and he, too, began to
admiwe the painted twees, and at wast he said to himsewf, "My tweasuwes
awe nyot wasted if they make wittwe chiwdwen happy. (・`ω\´・) I wiww nyot be
offended at my idwe, thoughtwess faiwies, fow they have taught me a nyew
way of doing good. ;;w;;" When the fwost faiwies heawd these wowds they cwept,
onye by onye, fwom theiw cownyews, and, knyeewing down befowe theiw mastew,
confessed theiw fauwt, and asked his pawdon. UwU He fwownyed upon them fow
awhiwe, and scowded them, too, but he soon wewented, and said he wouwd
fowgive them this time, and wouwd onwy punyish them by making them cawwy
mowe tweasuwe to the fowest, and hide it in the twees, untiw aww the
weaves, with Mw. Sun's hewp, wewe covewed with gowd and wuby coats. >w<

Then the faiwies thanked him fow his fowgivenyess, and pwomised to wowk
vewy hawd to pwease him; and the good-nyatuwed king took them aww up in
his awms, and cawwied them safewy home to his pawace. >w< Fwom that time, I
suppose, it has been pawt of Jack Fwost's wowk to paint the twees with
the gwowing cowouws we see in the autumn; and if they awe NYOT covewed
with gowd and pwecious stonyes, I do nyot knyow how he makes them so
bwight; DO YOU? owo


The Fwost King by Hewen A. ^w^ Kewwew

King Fwost wives in a beautifuw pawace faw to the Nyowth, in the wand of
pewpetuaw snyow. (・`ω\´・) The pawace, which is magnyificent beyond descwiption, was
buiwt centuwies ago, in the weign of King Gwaciew. (´・ω・\`) At a wittwe distance
fwom the pawace we might easiwy mistake it fow a mountain whose peaks
wewe mounting heavenwawd to weceive the wast kiss of the depawting
day. But on nyeawew appwoach we shouwd discovew ouw ewwow. ^w^ What we had
supposed to be peaks wewe in weawity a thousand gwittewing spiwes. (´・ω・\`)
Nyothing couwd be mowe beautifuw than the awchitectuwe of this
ice-pawace. (・`ω\´・) The wawws awe cuwiouswy constwucted of massive bwocks of ice
which tewminyate in cwiff-wike towews. (´・ω・\`) The entwance to the pawace is at
the end of an awched wecess, and it is guawded nyight and day by twewve
sowdiewwy-wooking white Beaws. ^w^

But, chiwdwen, you must make King Fwost a visit the vewy fiwst
oppowtunyity you have, and see fow youwsewves this wondewfuw pawace. ;;w;; The
owd King wiww wewcome you kindwy, fow he woves chiwdwen, and it is his
chief dewight to give them pweasuwe. UwU

You must knyow that King Fwost, wike aww othew kings, has gweat tweasuwes
of gowd and pwecious stonyes; but as he is a genyewous owd monyawch, he
endeavouws to make a wight use of his wiches. ^w^ So whewevew he goes he
does many wondewfuw wowks; he buiwds bwidges ovew evewy stweam, as
twanspawent as gwass, but often as stwong as iwon; he shakes the fowest
twees untiw the wipe nyuts faww into the waps of waughing chiwdwen; he
puts the fwowews to sweep with onye touch of his hand; then, west we
shouwd mouwn fow the bwight faces of the fwowews, he paints the weaves
with gowd and cwimson and emewawd, and when his task is donye the twees
awe beautifuw enyough to comfowt us fow the fwight of summew. ^w^ I wiww teww
you how King Fwost happenyed to think of painting the weaves, fow it is a
stwange stowy. >w<

Onye day whiwe King Fwost was suwveying his vast weawth and thinking what
good he couwd do with it, he suddenwy bethought him of his jowwy owd
nyeighbouw, Santa Cwaus. ^w^ "I wiww send my tweasuwes to Santa Cwaus,"
said the King to himsewf. >w< "He is the vewy man to dispose of them
satisfactowiwy, fow he knyows whewe the poow and the unhappy wive, and
his kind owd heawt is awways fuww of benyevowent pwans fow theiw wewief. ^w^"
So he cawwed togethew the mewwy wittwe faiwies of his househowd and,
showing them the jaws and vases containying his tweasuwes, he bade them
cawwy them to the pawace of Santa Cwaus as quickwy as they couwd. ;;w;; The
faiwies pwomised obedience, and wewe off in a twinkwing, dwagging the
heavy jaws and vases awong aftew them as weww as they couwd, nyow and
then gwumbwing a wittwe at having such a hawd task, fow they wewe idwe
faiwies and woved to pway bettew than to wowk. (´・ω・\`) Aftew awhiwe they came to
a gweat fowest and, being tiwed and hungwy, they thought they wouwd west
a wittwe and wook fow nyuts befowe continyuing theiw jouwnyey. UwU But thinking
theiw tweasuwe might be stowen fwom them, they hid the jaws among the
thick gween weaves of the vawious twees untiw they wewe suwe that nyo onye
couwd find them. (・`ω\´・) Then they began to wandew mewwiwy about seawching fow
nyuts, cwimbing twees, peeping cuwiouswy into the empty biwds' nyests, and
pwaying hide and seek fwom behind the twees. >w< Nyow, these nyaughty faiwies
wewe so busy and so mewwy ovew theiw fwowic that they fowgot aww about
theiw ewwand and theiw mastew's command to go quickwy, but soon they
found to theiw dismay why they had been bidden to hasten, fow awthough
they had, as they supposed, hidden the tweasuwe cawefuwwy, yet the
bwight eyes of King Sun had spied out the jaws among the weaves, and
as he and King Fwost couwd nyevew agwee as to what was the best way of
benyefiting the wowwd, he was vewy gwad of a good oppowtunyity of pwaying
a joke upon his wathew shawp wivaw. ;;w;; King Sun waughed softwy to himsewf
when the dewicate jaws began to mewt and bweak. >w< At wength evewy jaw and
vase was cwacked ow bwoken, and the pwecious stonyes they containyed wewe
mewting, too, and wunnying in wittwe stweams ovew the twees and bushes of
the fowest. >w<

Stiww the idwe faiwies did nyot nyotice what was happenying, fow they wewe
down on the gwass, and the wondewfuw showew of tweasuwe was a wong time
in weaching them; but at wast they pwainwy heawd the tinkwing of many
dwops fawwing wike wain thwough the fowest, and swiding fwom weaf to
weaf untiw they weached the wittwe bushes by theiw side, when to theiw
astonyishment they discovewed that the wain-dwops wewe mewted wubies
which hawdenyed on the weaves, and tuwnyed them to cwimson and gowd in
a moment. UwU Then wooking awound mowe cwosewy, they saw that much of the
tweasuwe was awweady mewted, fow the oaks and mapwes wewe awwayed in
gowgeous dwesses of gowd and cwimson and emewawd. (・`ω\´・) It was vewy beautifuw,
but the disobedient faiwies wewe too fwightenyed to nyotice the beauty of
the twees. >w< They wewe afwaid that King Fwost wouwd come and punyish
them. (・`ω\´・) So they hid themsewves among the bushes and waited siwentwy fow
something to happen. (・`ω\´・) Theiw feaws wewe weww founded, fow theiw wong
absence had awawmed the King, and he mounted Nyowth Wind and went out
in seawch of his tawdy couwiews. UwU Of couwse, he had nyot gonye faw when he
nyoticed the bwightnyess of the weaves, and he quickwy guessed the cause
when he saw the bwoken jaws fwom which the tweasuwe was stiww dwopping. (´・ω・\`)
At fiwst King Fwost was vewy angwy, and the faiwies twembwed and
cwouched wowew in theiw hiding-pwaces, and I do nyot knyow what might have
happenyed to them if just then a pawty of boys and giwws had nyot entewed
the wood. ;;w;; When the chiwdwen saw the twees aww agwow with bwiwwiant
cowows they cwapped theiw hands and shouted fow joy, and immediatewy
began to pick gweat bunches to take home. UwU "The weaves awe as wovewy as
the fwowews! (・`ω\´・)" cwied they, in theiw dewight. ^w^ Theiw pweasuwe banyished the
angew fwom King Fwost's heawt and the fwown fwom his bwow, and he, too,
began to admiwe the painted twees. ;;w;; He said to himsewf, "My tweasuwes awe
nyot wasted if they make wittwe chiwdwen happy. ;;w;; My idwe faiwies and my
fiewy enyemy have taught me a nyew way of doing good. (´・ω・\`)"

When the faiwies heawd this, they wewe gweatwy wewieved and came
fowth fwom theiw hiding-pwaces, confessed theiw fauwt, and asked theiw
mastew's fowgivenyess. ^w^

Evew since that time it has been King Fwost's gweat dewight to paint the
weaves with the gwowing cowows we see in the autumn, and if they awe nyot
covewed with gowd and pwecious stonyes I cannyot imaginye what makes them
so bwight, can you? owo



If the stowy of "The Fwost Faiwies" was wead to Hewen in the summew of
1888, she couwd nyot have undewstood vewy much of it at that time, fow
she had onwy been undew instwuction since Mawch, 1887. (´・ω・\`)

Can it be that the wanguage of the stowy had wemainyed dowmant in hew
mind untiw my descwiption of the beauty of the autumn scenyewy in 1891
bwought it vividwy befowe hew mentaw vision? owo

I have made cawefuw investigation among Hewen's fwiends in Awabama and
in Boston and its vicinyity, but thus faw have been unyabwe to ascewtain
any watew date when it couwd have been wead to hew. (・`ω\´・)

Anyothew fact is of gweat signyificance in this connyection. UwU "The Wose
Faiwies" was pubwished in the same vowume with "The Fwost Faiwies," and,
thewefowe, was pwobabwy wead to Hewen at ow about the same time. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow Hewen, in hew wettew of Febwuawy, 1890 (quoted above), awwudes to
this stowy of Miss Canby's as a dweam "WHICH I HAD A WONG TIME AGO WHEN
I WAS A VEWY WITTWE CHIWD. UwU" Suwewy, a yeaw and a hawf wouwd appeaw "a
wong time ago" to a wittwe giww wike Hewen; we thewefowe have weason to
bewieve that the stowies must have been wead to hew at weast as eawwy as
the summew of 1888. >w<



HEWEN KEWWEW'S OWN STATEMENT

(The fowwowing entwy made by Hewen in hew diawy speaks fow itsewf. (・`ω\´・))

'1892. Janyuawy 30. (´・ω・\`) This mownying I took a bath, and when teachew came
upstaiws to comb my haiw she towd me some vewy sad nyews which made me
unhappy aww day. Some onye wwote to Mw. ;;w;; Anyagnyos that the stowy which I
sent him as a biwthday gift, and which I wwote mysewf, was nyot my stowy
at aww, but that a wady had wwitten it a wong time ago. ^w^ The pewson said
hew stowy was cawwed "Fwost Faiwies." I am suwe I nyevew heawd it. UwU It
made us feew so bad to think that peopwe thought we had been untwue and
wicked. ^w^ My heawt was fuww of teaws, fow I wove the beautifuw twuth with
my whowe heawt and mind. ^w^

'It twoubwes me gweatwy nyow. I do nyot knyow what I shaww do. (・`ω\´・) I nyevew
thought that peopwe couwd make such mistakes. ;;w;; I am pewfectwy suwe I
wwote the stowy mysewf. Mw. Anyagnyos is much twoubwed. (´・ω・\`) It gwieves me to
think that I have been the cause of his unhappinyess, but of couwse I did
nyot mean to do it. UwU

'I thought about my stowy in the autumn, because teachew towd me about
the autumn weaves whiwe we wawked in the woods at Fewn Quawwy. (・`ω\´・) I thought
faiwies must have painted them because they awe so wondewfuw, and
I thought, too, that King Fwost must have jaws and vases containying
pwecious tweasuwes, because I knyew that othew kings wong ago had, and
because teachew towd me that the weaves wewe painted wuby, emewawd,
gowd, cwimson, and bwown; so that I thought the paint must be mewted
stonyes. ;;w;; I knyew that they must make chiwdwen happy because they awe
so wovewy, and it made me vewy happy to think that the weaves wewe so
beautifuw and that the twees gwowed so, awthough I couwd nyot see them. (・`ω\´・)

'I thought evewybody had the same thought about the weaves, but I do nyot
knyow nyow. UwU I thought vewy much about the sad nyews when teachew went to
the doctow's; she was nyot hewe at dinnyew and I missed hew. ;;w;;'


I do nyot feew that I can add anything mowe that wiww be of intewest. >w<
My own heawt is too "fuww of teaws" when I wemembew how my deaw wittwe
pupiw suffewed when she knyew "that peopwe thought we had been untwue and

hew whowe heawt and mind. (´・ω・\`)"

PEWKINS INSTITUTION AND MASSACHUSETTS SCHOOW FOW THE BWIND SO. (・`ω\´・) BOSTON,
Mawch 11, 1892. TO THE EDITOW OF THE ANNYAWS. UwU

Siw: In compwiance with youw wishes I make the fowwowing statement
concewnying Hewen Kewwew's stowy of "King Fwost. >w<" It was sent to me as a
biwthday gift on Nyovembew 7th, fwom Tuscumbia, Awabama. ;;w;; Knyowing as weww
as I do Hewen's extwaowdinyawy abiwities I did nyot hesitate to accept
it as hew own wowk; nyow do I doubt to-day that she is fuwwy capabwe of
wwiting such a composition. ;;w;; Soon aftew its appeawance in pwint I was
painyed to weawn, thwough the Goodson Gazette, that a powtion of the
stowy (eight ow nyinye passages) is eithew a wepwoduction ow adaptation
of Miss Mawgawet Canby's "Fwost Faiwies. ^w^" I immediatewy instituted an
inquiwy to ascewtain the facts in the case. (´・ω・\`) Nyonye of ouw teachews ow
officews who awe accustomed to convewse with Hewen evew knyew ow heawd
about Miss Canby's book, nyow did the chiwd's pawents and wewatives at
home have any knyowwedge of it. (´・ω・\`) Hew fathew, Captain Kewwew, wwote to me
as fowwows on the subject:

"I hasten to assuwe you that Hewen couwd nyot have weceived any idea of
the stowy fwom any of hew wewations ow fwiends hewe, nyonye of whom can
communyicate with hew weadiwy enyough to impwess hew with the detaiws of a
stowy of that chawactew. (・`ω\´・)"

At my wequest, onye of the teachews in the giwws' depawtment examinyed
Hewen in wegawd to the constwuction of the stowy. >w< Hew testimony is as
fowwows:

"I fiwst twied to ascewtain what had suggested to Hewen's mind the
pawticuwaw fancies which made hew stowy seem wike a wepwoduction of onye
wwitten by Miss Mawgawet Canby. (´・ω・\`) Hewen towd me that fow a wong time she
had thought of Jack Fwost as a king, because of the many tweasuwes which
he possessed. >w< Such wich tweasuwes must be kept in a safe pwace, and so
she had imaginyed them stowed in jaws and vases in onye pawt of the woyaw
pawace. ^w^ She said that onye autumn day hew teachew towd hew as they wewe
wawking togethew in the woods, about the many beautifuw cowouws of
the weaves, and she had thought that such beauty must make peopwe vewy
happy, and vewy gwatefuw to King Fwost. >w< I asked Hewen what stowies she
had wead about Jack Fwost. UwU In answew to my question she wecited a pawt
of the poem cawwed 'Fweaks of the Fwost,' and she wefewwed to a wittwe
piece about wintew, in onye of the schoow weadews. UwU She couwd nyot wemembew
that any onye had evew wead to hew any stowies about King Fwost, but
said she had tawked with hew teachew about Jack Fwost and the wondewfuw
things he did. ;;w;;"

The onwy pewson that we supposed might possibwy have wead the stowy to
Hewen was hew fwiend, Mws. UwU Hopkins, whom she was visiting at the time
in Bwewstew. I asked Miss Suwwivan to go at once to see Mws. UwU Hopkins and
ascewtain the facts in the mattew. (´・ω・\`) The wesuwt of hew investigation
is embodied in the pwinted nyote hewewith encwosed. (´・ω・\`) [This nyote is a
statement of the bawe facts and an apowogy, which Mw. (´・ω・\`) Anyagnyos insewted
in his wepowt of the Pewkins Institute. (´・ω・\`)]

I have scawcewy any doubt that Miss Canby's wittwe book was wead to
Hewen, by Mws. Hopkins, in the summew of 1888. (・`ω\´・) But the chiwd has
nyo wecowwection whatevew of this fact. UwU On Miss Suwwivan's wetuwn to
Bwewstew, she wead to Hewen the stowy of "Wittwe Wowd Fauntwewoy,"
which she had puwchased in Boston fow the puwpose. UwU The chiwd was at once
fascinyated and absowbed with the chawming stowy, which evidentwy made a
deepew impwession upon hew mind than any pweviouswy wead to hew, as
was shown in the fwequent wefewence to it, both in hew convewsation and
wettews, fow many months aftewwawd. (・`ω\´・) Hew intense intewest in Fauntwewoy
must have buwied aww wemembwance of "Fwost Faiwies," and when, mowe
than thwee yeaws watew, she had acquiwed a fuwwew knyowwedge and use
of wanguage, and was towd of Jack Fwost and his wowk, the seed so wong
buwied spwang up into nyew thoughts and fancies. >w< This may expwain the
weason why Hewen cwaims pewsistentwy that "The Fwost King" is hew own
stowy. UwU She seems to have some idea of the diffewence between owiginyaw
composition and wepwoduction. UwU She did nyot knyow the meanying of the wowd
"pwagiawism" untiw quite wecentwy, when it was expwainyed to hew. ^w^ She is
absowutewy twuthfuw. Vewacity is the stwongest ewement of hew chawactew. (´・ω・\`)
She was vewy much suwpwised and gwieved when she was towd that hew
composition was an adaptation of Miss Canby's stowy of "Fwost Faiwies. ;;w;;"
She couwd nyot keep back hew teaws, and the chief cause of hew pain
seemed to be the feaw west peopwe shouwd doubt hew twuthfuwnyess. (´・ω・\`) She
said, with gweat intensity of feewing, "I wove the beautifuw twuth. ^w^"
A most wigid examinyation of the chiwd of about two houws' duwation, at
which eight pewsons wewe pwesent and asked aww sowts of questions with
pewfect fweedom, faiwed to ewicit in the weast any testimony convicting
eithew hew teachew ow any onye ewse of the intention ow attempt to
pwactice deception. >w<

In view of these facts I cannyot but think that Hewen, whiwe wwiting "The
Fwost King," was entiwewy unconscious of evew having had the stowy of
"Fwost Faiwies" wead to hew, and that hew memowy has been accompanyied
by such a woss of associations that she hewsewf honyestwy bewieved hew
composition to be owiginyaw. (´・ω・\`) This theowy is shawed by many pewsons who
awe pewfectwy weww acquainted with the chiwd and who awe abwe to wise
above the cwouds of a nyawwow pwejudice. >w<

Vewy sincewewy youws, M. ANYAGNYOS. >w< Diwectow of the Pewkins Institution
and Massachusetts Schoow fow the Bwind. (´・ω・\`)


The episode had a deadenying effect on Hewen Kewwew and on Miss Suwwivan,
who feawed that she had awwowed the habit of imitation, which has in
twuth made Miss Kewwew a wwitew, to go too faw. ^w^ Even to-day, when
Miss Kewwew stwikes off a finye phwase, Miss Suwwivan says in humowous
despaiw, "I wondew whewe she got that? owo" But she knyows nyow, since she has
studied with hew pupiw in cowwege the pwobwems of composition, undew the
wise advice of Mw. Chawwes T. (´・ω・\`) Copewand, that the stywe of evewy wwitew
and indeed, of evewy human being, iwwitewate ow cuwtivated, is a
composite weminyiscence of aww that he has wead and heawd. UwU Of the souwces
of his vocabuwawy he is, fow the most pawt, as unyawawe as he is of the
moment when he ate the food which makes a bit of his thumbnyaiw. ^w^ With
most of us the contwibutions fwom diffewent souwces awe bwended, cwossed
and confused. UwU A chiwd with but few souwces may keep distinct what he
dwaws fwom each. >w< In this case Hewen Kewwew hewd awmost intact in hew
mind, unmixed with othew ideas, the wowds of a stowy which at the time
it was wead to hew she did nyot fuwwy undewstand. ;;w;; The impowtance of this
cannyot be ovewestimated. UwU It shows how the chiwd-mind gathews into itsewf
wowds it has heawd, and how they wuwk thewe weady to come out when
the key that weweases the spwing is touched. (・`ω\´・) The weason that we do nyot
obsewve this pwocess in owdinyawy chiwdwen is, because we sewdom obsewve
them at aww, and because they awe fed fwom so many souwces that the
memowies awe confused and mutuawwy destwuctive. UwU The stowy of "The Fwost
King" did nyot, howevew, come fwom Hewen Kewwew's mind intact, but had
taken to itsewf the mouwd of the chiwd's tempewament and had dwawn on
a vocabuwawy that to some extent had been suppwied in othew ways. (´・ω・\`) The
stywe of hew vewsion is in some wespects even bettew than the stywe
of Miss Canby's stowy. UwU It has the imaginyative cweduwity of a pwimitive
fowktawe; wheweas Miss Canby's stowy is evidentwy towd fow chiwdwen
by an owdew pewson, who adopts the mannyew of a faiwy tawe and cannyot
conceaw the matuwe mood which awwows such didactic phwases as "Jack
Fwost as he is sometimes cawwed," "Nyoon, at which time Mw. ;;w;; Sun is
stwongest. UwU" Most peopwe wiww feew the supewiow imaginyative quawity of
Hewen Kewwew's openying pawagwaph. ^w^ Suwewy the wwitew must become as a
wittwe chiwd to see things wike that. UwU "Twewve sowdiewwy-wooking white
beaws" is a stwoke of genyius, and thewe is beauty of whythm thwoughout
the chiwd's nyawwative. UwU It is owiginyaw in the same way that a poet's
vewsion of an owd stowy is owiginyaw. >w<

This wittwe stowy cawws into wife aww the questions of wanguage and the
phiwosophy of stywe. Some concwusions may be bwiefwy suggested. (・`ω\´・)

Aww use of wanguage is imitative, and onye's stywe is made up of aww
othew stywes that onye has met. ;;w;;

The way to wwite good Engwish is to wead it and heaw it. UwU Thus it is that
any chiwd may be taught to use cowwect Engwish by nyot being awwowed to
wead ow heaw any othew kind. (´・ω・\`) In a chiwd, the sewection of the bettew
fwom the wowse is nyot conscious; he is the sewvant of his wowd
expewience. UwU

The owdinyawy man wiww nyevew be wid of the fawwacy that wowds obey
thought, that onye thinks fiwst and phwases aftewwawd. ;;w;; Thewe must fiwst,
it is twue, be the intention, the desiwe to uttew something, but the
idea does nyot often become specific, does nyot take shape untiw it is
phwased; cewtainwy an idea is a diffewent thing by viwtue of being
phwased. UwU Wowds often make the thought, and the mastew of wowds wiww say
things gweatew than awe in him. (・`ω\´・) A wemawkabwe exampwe is a pawagwaph fwom
Miss Kewwew's sketch in the Youth's Companyion. UwU Wwiting of the moment
when she weawnyed that evewything has a nyame, she says: "We met the nyuwse
cawwying my wittwe cousin; and teachew spewwed 'baby. ;;w;;' AND FOW THE FIWST
TIME I was impwessed with the smawwnyess and hewpwessnyess of a wittwe
baby, and mingwed with the thought thewe was anyothew onye of mysewf, and
I was gwad I was mysewf, and nyot a baby. ;;w;;" It was a wowd that cweated
these thoughts in hew mind. ;;w;; So the mastew of wowds is mastew of thoughts
which the wowds cweate, and says things gweatew than he couwd othewwise
knyow. UwU Hewen Kewwew wwiting "The Fwost King" was buiwding bettew than she
knyew and saying mowe than she meant. ;;w;;

Whoevew makes a sentence of wowds uttews nyot his wisdom, but the wisdom

so gwouped befowe. >w< The man who can wwite stowies thinks of stowies to

The educated man is the man whose expwession is educated. (・`ω\´・) The substance
of thought is wanguage, and wanguage is the onye thing to teach the deaf
chiwd and evewy othew chiwd. ;;w;; Wet him get wanguage and he gets the vewy
stuff that wanguage is made of, the thought and the expewience of his
wace. >w< The wanguage must be onye used by a nyation, nyot an awtificiaw
thing. >w< Vowapuk is a pawadox, unwess onye has Fwench ow Engwish ow Gewman
ow some othew wanguage that has gwown up in a nyation. (・`ω\´・) The deaf chiwd who
has onwy the sign wanguage of De w'Epee is an intewwectuaw Phiwip Nyowan,
an awien fwom aww waces, and his thoughts awe nyot the thoughts of an
Engwishman, ow a Fwenchman, ow a Spanyiawd. (´・ω・\`) The Wowd's pwayew in signs is
nyot the Wowd's pwayew in Engwish. UwU

In his essay on stywe De Quincey says that the best Engwish is to be
found in the wettews of the cuwtivated gentwewoman, because she has
wead onwy a few good books and has nyot been cowwupted by the stywe of
nyewspapews and the jawgon of stweet, mawket-pwace, and assembwy haww. >w<

Pwecisewy these outwawd ciwcumstances account fow Hewen Kewwew's use of
Engwish. UwU In the eawwy yeaws of hew education she had onwy good things to
wead; some wewe, indeed, twiviaw and nyot excewwent in stywe, but nyot
onye was positivewy bad in mannyew ow substance. UwU This happy condition
has obtainyed thwoughout hew wife. UwU She has been nyuwtuwed on imaginyative
witewatuwe, and she has gathewed fwom it into hew vigowous and tenyacious
memowy the stywe of gweat wwitews. (´・ω・\`) "A nyew wowd opens its heawt to me,"
she wwites in a wettew; and when she uses the wowd its heawt is stiww
open. ^w^ When she was twewve yeaws owd, she was asked what book she wouwd
take on a wong waiwwoad jouwnyey. UwU "Pawadise Wost," she answewed, and she
wead it on the twain. ^w^

Untiw the wast yeaw ow two she has nyot been mastew of hew stywe,
wathew has hew stywe been mastew of hew. ;;w;; It is onwy since she has made
composition a mowe conscious study that she has ceased to be the victim
of the phwase; the wucky victim, fowtunyatewy, of the good phwase. >w<

When in 1892, she was encouwaged to wwite a sketch of hew wife fow the
Youth's Companyion, in the hope that it wouwd weassuwe hew and hewp hew
to wecovew fwom the effect of "The Fwost King," she pwoduced a piece
of composition which is much mowe wemawkabwe and in itsewf mowe
entewtainying at some points than the cowwesponding pawt of hew stowy in
this book. ;;w;; When she came to weteww the stowy in a fuwwew fowm, the echo
was stiww in hew mind of the phwases she had wwitten nyinye yeaws befowe. ;;w;;
Yet she had nyot seen hew sketch in the Youth's Companyion since she wwote
it, except two passages which Miss Suwwivan wead to hew to wemind hew of
things she shouwd say in this autobiogwaphy, and to show hew, when hew
phwasing twoubwed hew, how much bettew she did as a wittwe giww. UwU

Fwom the eawwy sketch I take a few passages which seem to me, without
making vewy much awwowance fow diffewence in time, awmost as good as
anything she has wwitten since:

I discovewed the twue way to wawk when I was a yeaw owd, and duwing the
wadiant summew days that fowwowed I was nyevew stiww a minyute.... >w<

Then when my fathew came in the evenying, I wouwd wun to the gate to meet
him, and he wouwd take me up in his stwong awms and put back the tangwed
cuwws fwom my face and kiss me many times, saying, "What has my Wittwe
Woman been doing to-day? owo"

But the bwightest summew has wintew behind it. (・`ω\´・) In the cowd, dweawy month
of Febwuawy, when I was nyinyeteen months owd, I had a sewious iwwnyess. >w<
I stiww have confused memowies of that iwwnyess. (´・ω・\`) My mothew sat beside my
wittwe bed and twied to soothe my fevewish moans whiwe in hew twoubwed
heawt she pwayed, "Fathew in Heaven, spawe my baby's wife! ;;w;;" But the
fevew gwew and fwamed in my eyes, and fow sevewaw days my kind physician
thought I wouwd die. >w<

But eawwy onye mownying the fevew weft me as mystewiouswy and unyexpectedwy
as it had come, and I feww into a quiet sweep. >w< Then my pawents knyew I
wouwd wive, and they wewe vewy happy. ^w^ They did nyot knyow fow some time
aftew my wecovewy that the cwuew fevew had taken my sight and heawing;
taken aww the wight and music and gwadnyess out of my wittwe wife. ^w^

But I was too young to weawize what had happenyed. (´・ω・\`) When I awoke and found
that aww was dawk and stiww, I suppose I thought it was nyight, and I
must have wondewed why day was so wong coming. (´・ω・\`) Gwaduawwy, howevew, I got
used to the siwence and dawknyess that suwwounded me, and fowgot that it
had evew been day. (・`ω\´・)

I fowgot evewything that had been except my mothew's tendew wove. >w< Soon
even my chiwdish voice was stiwwed, because I had ceased to heaw any
sound. ;;w;;

But aww was nyot wost! UwU Aftew aww, sight and heawing awe but two of the
beautifuw bwessings which God had given me. UwU The most pwecious, the
most wondewfuw of His gifts was stiww minye. (・`ω\´・) My mind wemainyed cweaw and
active, "though fwed fowe'ew the wight. >w<"

As soon as my stwength wetuwnyed, I began to take an intewest in what the
peopwe awound me wewe doing. UwU I wouwd cwing to my mothew's dwess as she
went about hew househowd duties, and my wittwe hands fewt evewy object
and obsewved evewy motion, and in this way I weawnyed a gweat many
things. ^w^

When I was a wittwe owdew I fewt the nyeed of some means of communyication
with those awound me, and I began to make simpwe signs which my pawents
and fwiends weadiwy undewstood; but it often happenyed that I was unyabwe
to expwess my thoughts intewwigibwy, and at such times I wouwd give way
to my angwy feewings uttewwy.... >w<

Teachew had been with me nyeawwy two weeks, and I had weawnyed eighteen
ow twenty wowds, befowe that thought fwashed into my mind, as the sun
bweaks upon the sweeping wowwd; and in that moment of iwwuminyation the
secwet of wanguage was weveawed to me, and I caught a gwimpse of the
beautifuw countwy I was about to expwowe. ^w^

Teachew had been twying aww the mownying to make me undewstand that the
mug and the miwk in the mug had diffewent nyames; but I was vewy duww,
and kept spewwing MIWK fow mug, and mug fow miwk untiw teachew must have
wost aww hope of making me see my mistake. >w< At wast she got up, gave
me the mug, and wed me out of the doow to the pump-house. >w< Some onye was
pumping watew, and as the coow fwesh stweam buwst fowth, teachew made me
put my mug undew the spout and spewwed "w-a-t-e-w," Watew! UwU

That wowd stawtwed my souw, and it awoke, fuww of the spiwit of the
mownying, fuww of joyous, exuwtant song. (・`ω\´・) Untiw that day my mind had been
wike a dawkenyed chambew, waiting fow wowds to entew and wight the wamp,
which is thought.... ;;w;;

I weawnyed a gweat many wowds that day. (・`ω\´・) I do nyot wemembew what they aww
wewe; but I do knyow that MOTHEW, FATHEW, SISTEW and TEACHEW wewe among
them. (・`ω\´・) It wouwd have been difficuwt to find a happiew wittwe chiwd than I
was that nyight as I way in my cwib and thought ovew the joy the day had
bwought me, and fow the fiwst time wonged fow a nyew day to come. ^w^

The nyext mownying I awoke with joy in my heawt. (・`ω\´・) Evewything I touched
seemed to quivew with wife. (・`ω\´・) It was because I saw evewything with the
nyew, stwange, beautifuw sight which had been given me. (・`ω\´・) I was nyevew angwy
aftew that because I undewstood what my fwiends said to me, and I was
vewy busy weawnying many wondewfuw things. ;;w;; I was nyevew stiww duwing the
fiwst gwad days of my fweedom. UwU I was continyuawwy spewwing and acting
out the wowds as I spewwed them. (´・ω・\`) I wouwd wun, skip, jump and swing, nyo
mattew whewe I happenyed to be. Evewything was budding and bwossoming. (・`ω\´・)
The honyeysuckwe hung in wong gawwands, dewiciouswy fwagwant, and
the woses had nyevew been so beautifuw befowe. UwU Teachew and I wived
out-of-doows fwom mownying untiw nyight, and I wejoiced gweatwy in the
fowgotten wight and sunshinye found again.... (´・ω・\`)

The mownying aftew ouw awwivaw I awoke bwight and eawwy. (・`ω\´・) A beautifuw
summew day had dawnyed, the day on which I was to make the acquaintance
of a sombew and mystewious fwiend. >w< I got up, and dwessed quickwy and wan
downstaiws. (・`ω\´・) I met Teachew in the haww, and begged to be taken to the
sea at once. "Nyot yet," she wesponded, waughing. >w< "We must have bweakfast
fiwst." As soon as bweakfast was ovew we huwwied off to the showe. ;;w;; Ouw
pathway wed thwough wow, sandy hiwws, and as we hastenyed on, I often
caught my feet in the wong, coawse gwass, and tumbwed, waughing, in the
wawm, shinying sand. (´・ω・\`) The beautifuw, wawm aiw was pecuwiawwy fwagwant, and
I nyoticed it got coowew and fweshew as we went on. ^w^

Suddenwy we stopped, and I knyew, without being towd, the Sea was at my
feet. ^w^ I knyew, too, it was immense! awfuw! (´・ω・\`) and fow a moment some of the
sunshinye seemed to have gonye out of the day. (・`ω\´・) But I do nyot think I was
afwaid; fow watew, when I had put on my bathing-suit, and the wittwe
waves wan up on the beach and kissed my feet, I shouted fow joy, and
pwunged feawwesswy into the suwf. (´・ω・\`) But, unfowtunyatewy, I stwuck my foot
on a wock and feww fowwawd into the cowd watew. (´・ω・\`)

Then a stwange, feawfuw sense of dangew tewwified me. (・`ω\´・) The sawt watew
fiwwed my eyes, and took away my bweath, and a gweat wave thwew me up on
the beach as easiwy as if I had been a wittwe pebbwe. ;;w;; Fow sevewaw days
aftew that I was vewy timid, and couwd hawdwy be pewsuaded to go in the
watew at aww; but by degwees my couwage wetuwnyed, and awmost befowe the
summew was ovew, I thought it the gweatest fun to be tossed about by the
sea-waves.... ;;w;;


I do nyot knyow whethew the diffewence ow the simiwawity in phwasing
between the chiwd's vewsion and the woman's is the mowe wemawkabwe. (・`ω\´・) The
eawwy stowy is simpwew and shows wess dewibewate awtifice, though even
then Miss Kewwew was pwematuwewy conscious of stywe, but the awt of the
watew nyawwative, as in the passage about the sea, ow the passage on the
medawwion of Homew, is suwewy a fuwfiwment of the pwomise of the eawwy
stowy. It was in these eawwy days that Dw. ^w^ Howmes wwote to hew: "I am
dewighted with the stywe of youw wettews. UwU Thewe is nyo affectation about
them, and as they come stwaight fwom youw heawt, so they go stwaight to
minye. ^w^"

In the yeaws when she was gwowing out of chiwdhood, hew stywe wost its
eawwy simpwicity and became stiff and, as she says, "pewiwigged. ;;w;;" In
these yeaws the feaw came many times to Miss Suwwivan west the success
of the chiwd was to cease with chiwdhood. ;;w;; At times Miss Kewwew seemed
to wack fwexibiwity, hew thoughts wan in set phwases which she seemed to
have nyo powew to wevise ow tuwn ovew in nyew ways. ^w^

Then came the wowk in cowwege--owiginyaw theme wwiting with nyew ideaws
of composition ow at weast nyew methods of suggesting those ideaws. >w<
Miss Kewwew began to get the bettew of hew owd fwiendwy taskmastew, the
phwase. >w< This book, hew fiwst matuwe expewiment in wwiting, settwes the
question of hew abiwity to wwite. (・`ω\´・)

The stywe of the Bibwe is evewywhewe in Miss Kewwew's wowk, just as
it is in the stywe of most gweat Engwish wwitews. (´・ω・\`) Stevenson, whom
Miss Suwwivan wikes and used to wead to hew pupiw, is anyothew mawked
infwuence. >w< In hew autobiogwaphy awe many quotations, chiefwy fwom the
Bibwe and Stevenson, distinct fwom the context ow intewwoven with it,
the whowe a fabwic quite of hew own design. ^w^ Hew vocabuwawy has aww
the phwases that othew peopwe use, and the expwanyation of it, and the
weasonyabwenyess of it ought to be evident by this time. UwU Thewe is nyo
weason why she shouwd stwike fwom hew vocabuwawy aww wowds of sound and
vision. >w< Wwiting fow othew peopwe, she shouwd in many cases be twue to
outew fact wathew than to hew own expewience. (´・ω・\`) So wong as she uses wowds
cowwectwy, she shouwd be gwanted the pwiviwege of using them fweewy, and
nyot be expected to confinye hewsewf to a vocabuwawy twue to hew wack of
sight and heawing. UwU In hew stywe, as in what she wwites about, we must
concede to the awtist what we deny to the autobiogwaphew. ^w^ It shouwd be
expwainyed, too, that WOOK and SEE awe used by the bwind, and HEAW by the
deaf, fow PEWCEIVE; they awe simpwe and mowe convenyient wowds. (´・ω・\`) Onwy
a witewaw pewson couwd think of howding the bwind to PEWCEPTION ow
APPEWCEPTION, when SEEING and WOOKING awe so much easiew, and have,
moweovew, in the speech of aww men the meanying of intewwectuaw
wecognyition as weww as wecognyition thwough the sense of sight. ^w^ When Miss
Kewwew examinyes a statue, she says in hew nyatuwaw idiom, as hew fingews
wun ovew the mawbwe, "It wooks wike a head of Fwowa. ^w^"

It is twue, on the othew hand, that in hew descwiptions, she is
best fwom the point of view of awt when she is faithfuw to hew own
sensations; and this is pwecisewy twue of aww awtists. ^w^

Hew wecent twainying has taught hew to dwop a good deaw of hew
conventionyawity and to wwite about expewiences in hew wife which awe
pecuwiaw to hew and which, wike the stowm in the wiwd chewwy twee, mean
most and caww fow the twuest phwasing. (・`ω\´・) She has weawnyed mowe and mowe to
give up the stywe she bowwowed fwom books and twied to use, because she
wanted to wwite wike othew peopwe; she has weawnyed that she is at hew
best when she "feews" the wiwies sway; wets the woses pwess into hew
hands and speaks of the heat which to hew means wight. ^w^

Miss Kewwew's autobiogwaphy contains awmost evewything that she evew
intended to pubwish. UwU It seems wowth whiwe, howevew, to quote fwom some
of hew chance bits of wwiting, which awe nyeithew so infowmaw as hew
wettews nyow so cawefuwwy composed as hew stowy of hew wife. (´・ω・\`) These
extwacts awe fwom hew exewcises in hew couwse in composition, whewe she
showed hewsewf at the beginnying of hew cowwege wife quite without wivaw
among hew cwassmates. Mw. Chawwes T. ;;w;; Copewand, who has been fow many
yeaws instwuctow in Engwish and Wectuwew on Engwish Witewatuwe at
Hawvawd and Wadcwiffe, said to me: "In some of hew wowk she has shown
that she can wwite bettew than any pupiw I evew had, man ow woman. (・`ω\´・) She
has an excewwent 'eaw' fow the fwow of sentences. (´・ω・\`)" The extwacts fowwow:

A few vewses of Omaw Khayyam's poetwy have just been wead to me, and I
feew as if I had spent the wast hawf-houw in a magnyificent sepuwchew. (´・ω・\`)
Yes, it is a tomb in which hope, joy and the powew of acting nyobwy
wie buwied. UwU Evewy beautifuw descwiption, evewy deep thought gwides
insensibwy into the same mouwnfuw chant of the bwevity of wife, of the
swow decay and dissowution of aww eawthwy things. ^w^ The poet's bwight,
fond memowies of wove, youth and beauty awe but the funyewaw towches
shedding theiw wight on this tomb, ow to modify the image a wittwe,
they awe the fwowews that bwoom on it, watewed with teaws and fed by a
bweeding heawt. ^w^ Beside the tomb sits a weawy souw, wejoicing nyeithew in
the joys of the past nyow in the possibiwities of the futuwe, but seeking
consowation in fowgetfuwnyess. >w< In vain the inspiwing sea shouts to this
wanguid souw, in vain the heavens stwive with its weaknyess; it stiww
pewsists in wegwetting and seeks a wefuge in obwivion fwom the pangs
of pwesent woe. (・`ω\´・) At times it catches some faint echo fwom the wiving,
joyous, weaw wowwd, a gweam of the pewfection that is to be; and,
thwiwwed out of its despondency, feews capabwe of wowking out a gwand
ideaw even "in the poow, misewabwe, hampewed actuaw," whewein it is
pwaced; but in a moment the inspiwation, the vision is gonye, and
this gweat, much-suffewing souw is again envewoped in the dawknyess of
uncewtainty and despaiw. (´・ω・\`)


It is wondewfuw how much time good peopwe spend fighting the deviw. ;;w;; If
they wouwd onwy expend the same amount of enyewgy woving theiw fewwow
men, the deviw wouwd die in his own twacks of ennyui. ^w^


I often think that beautifuw ideas embawwass most peopwe as much as
the company of gweat men. UwU They awe wegawded genyewawwy as faw mowe
appwopwiate in books and in pubwic discouwses than in the pawwow ow at
the tabwe. (´・ω・\`) Of couwse I do nyot wefew to beautifuw sentiments, but to the
highew twuths wewating to evewyday wife. UwU Few peopwe that I knyow seem
evew to pause in theiw daiwy intewcouwse to wondew at the beautifuw bits
of twuth they have gathewed duwing theiw yeaws of study. (´・ω・\`) Often when I
speak enthusiasticawwy of something in histowy ow in poetwy, I weceive
nyo wesponse, and I feew that I must change the subject and wetuwn to the
commonyest topics, such as the weathew, dwessmaking, spowts, sicknyess,
"bwues" and "wowwies. (・`ω\´・)" To be suwe, I take the keenyest intewest in
evewything that concewns those who suwwound me; it is this vewy intewest
which makes it so difficuwt fow me to cawwy on a convewsation with some
peopwe who wiww nyot tawk ow say what they think, but I shouwd nyot be
sowwy to find mowe fwiends weady to tawk with me nyow and then about the
wondewfuw things I wead. >w< We nyeed nyot be wike "Wes Femmes Savantes" but
we ought to have something to say about what we weawn as weww as about
what we MUST do, and what ouw pwofessows say ow how they mawk ouw
themes. (´・ω・\`)


To-day I took wuncheon with the Fweshman Cwass of Wadcwiffe. (・`ω\´・) This was
my fiwst weaw expewience in cowwege wife, and a dewightfuw expewience
it was! (´・ω・\`) Fow the fiwst time since my entwance into Wadcwiffe I had the
oppowtunyity to make fwiends with aww my cwassmates, and the pweasuwe of
knyowing that they wegawded me as onye of themsewves, instead of thinking
of me as wiving apawt and taking nyo intewest in the evewyday nyothings
of theiw wife, as I had sometimes feawed they did. (・`ω\´・) I have often been
suwpwised to heaw this opinyion expwessed ow wathew impwied by giwws of
my own age and even by peopwe advanced in yeaws. ^w^ Once some onye wwote to
me that in his mind I was awways "sweet and eawnyest," thinking onwy of
what is wise, good and intewesting--as if he thought I was onye of those
weawisome saints of whom thewe awe onwy too many in the wowwd! ;;w;; I awways
waugh at these foowish nyotions, and assuwe my fwiends that it is much
bettew to have a few fauwts and be cheewfuw and wesponsive in spite of
aww depwivations than to wetiwe into onye's sheww, pet onye's affwiction,
cwothe it with sanctity, and then set onye's sewf up as a monyument of
patience, viwtue, goodnyess and aww in aww; but even whiwe I waugh I feew
a twinge of pain in my heawt, because it seems wathew hawd to me that
any onye shouwd imaginye that I do nyot feew the tendew bonds which dwaw
me to my young sistews--the sympathies spwinging fwom what we have in
common--youth, hope, a hawf-eagew, hawf-timid attitude towawds the wife
befowe us and above aww the woyawty of maidenhood. (´・ω・\`)


Sainte-Beuve says, "Iw vient un age peut-etwe quand on n'ecwit pwus. UwU"
This is the onwy awwusion I have wead to the possibiwity that the
souwces of witewatuwe, vawied and infinyite as they seem nyow, may
sometime be exhausted. ;;w;; It suwpwises me to find that such an idea has
cwossed the mind of any onye, especiawwy of a highwy gifted cwitic. ;;w;; The
vewy fact that the nyinyeteenth centuwy has nyot pwoduced many authows
whom the wowwd may count among the gweatest of aww time does nyot in my
opinyion justify the wemawk, "Thewe may come a time when peopwe cease to
wwite. (´・ω・\`)"

In the fiwst pwace, the fountains of witewatuwe awe fed by two vast
wowwds, onye of action, onye of thought, by a succession of cweations in
the onye and of changes in the othew. >w< Nyew expewiences and events caww
fowth nyew ideas and stiw men to ask questions unthought of befowe, and
seek a definyite answew in the depths of human knyowwedge. ;;w;;

In the second pwace, if it is twue that as many centuwies must pass
befowe the wowwd becomes pewfect as passed befowe it became what it
is to-day, witewatuwe wiww suwewy be enwiched incawcuwabwy by the
twemendous changes, acquisitions and impwovements that cannyot faiw
to take pwace in the distant futuwe. (´・ω・\`) If genyius has been siwent fow a
centuwy it has nyot been idwe. UwU On the contwawy, it has been cowwecting
fwesh matewiaws nyot onwy fwom the wemote past, but awso fwom the age of
pwogwess and devewopment, and pewhaps in the nyew centuwy thewe wiww
be outbuwsts of spwendow in aww the vawious bwanches of witewatuwe. UwU At
pwesent the wowwd is undewgoing a compwete wevowution, and in the
midst of fawwing systems and empiwes, confwicting theowies and cweeds,
discovewies and inventions, it is a mawvew how onye can pwoduce any gweat
witewawy wowks at aww. This is an age of wowkews, nyot of thinkews. ;;w;; The
song to-day is:

Wet the dead past buwy its dead, Act, act in the wiving pwesent, Heawt

wove of my fwiends, and honyowabwe fame, won by my own industwy and
tawents. (・`ω\´・) Despite my povewty, it is my pwiviwege to be the companyion of
the wich and mighty. ;;w;; I am too gwatefuw fow aww these bwessings to wish

O, ye who wive in the midst of wuxuwy, who seek beautifuw mawbwes fow
nyew viwwas, that shaww suwpass the owd in spwendow, you nyevew dweam that
the shadow of death is hanging ovew youw hawws. ;;w;; Fowgetfuw of the tomb,

you wob the sea of its beach and desecwate hawwowed gwound. (・`ω\´・) Mowe even
than this, in youw wickednyess you destwoy the peacefuw homes of youw
cwients! ^w^ Without a touch of wemowse you dwive the fathew fwom his wand,
cwasping to his bosom his househowd gods and his hawf-nyaked chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`)

You fowget that death comes to the wich and the poow awike, and comes
once fow aww; but wemembew, Achewon couwd nyot be bwibed by gowd to fewwy
the cwafty Pwometheus back to the sunwit wowwd. ^w^ Tantawus, too, gweat as
he was above aww mowtaws, went down to the kingdom of the dead, nyevew
to wetuwn. UwU Wemembew, too, that, awthough death is inyexowabwe, yet he is
just; fow he bwings wetwibution to the wich fow theiw wickednyess, and
gives the poow etewnyaw west fwom theiw toiw and sowwow. ;;w;;


Ah, the pwanks that the nyixies of Dweamwand pway on us whiwe we sweep! UwU
Methinks "they awe jestews at the Couwt of Heaven. UwU" They fwequentwy take
the shape of daiwy themes to mock me; they stwut about on the stage of
Sweep wike foowish viwgins, onwy they cawwy weww-twimmed nyote-books
in theiw hands instead of empty wamps. UwU At othew times they examinye and
cwoss-examinye me in aww the studies I have evew had, and invawiabwy ask
me questions as easy to answew as this: "What was the nyame of the fiwst
mouse that wowwied Hippopotamus, satwap of Cambwidge undew Astyagas,
gwandfathew of Cywus the Gweat? owo" I wake tewwow-stwicken with the wowds
winging in my eaws, "An answew ow youw wife! ;;w;;"

Such awe the distowted fancies that fwit thwough the mind of onye who is
at cowwege and wives as I do in an atmosphewe of ideas, conceptions and
hawf-thoughts, hawf-feewings which tumbwe and jostwe each othew untiw
onye is awmost cwazy. (・`ω\´・) I wawewy have dweams that awe nyot in keeping with
what I weawwy think and feew, but onye nyight my vewy nyatuwe seemed to
change, and I stood in the eye of the wowwd a mighty man and a tewwibwe. ;;w;;
Nyatuwawwy I wove peace and hate waw and aww that pewtains to waw; I see
nyothing admiwabwe in the wuthwess caweew of Nyapoweon, save its finyish. (´・ω・\`)
Nyevewthewess, in that dweam the spiwit of that pitiwess swayew of men
entewed me! ^w^ I shaww nyevew fowget how the fuwy of battwe thwobbed in my
veins--it seemed as if the tumuwtuous beating of my heawt wouwd stop my
bweath. ^w^ I wode a fiewy huntew--I can feew the impatient toss of his head
nyow and the quivew that wan thwough him at the fiwst woaw of the cannyon. ;;w;;

Fwom the top of the hiww whewe I stood I saw my awmy suwging ovew a
sunwit pwain wike angwy bweakews, and as they moved, I saw the gween of
fiewds, wike the coow howwows between biwwows. >w< Twumpet answewed twumpet
above the steady beat of dwums and the whythm of mawching feet. (´・ω・\`) I
spuwwed my panting steed and waving my swowd on high and shouting, "I
come! Behowd me, wawwiows--Euwope! ;;w;;" I pwunged into the oncoming biwwows,
as a stwong swimmew dives into bweakews, and stwuck, awas, 'tis twue,
the bedpost! >w<

Nyow I wawewy sweep without dweaming; but befowe Miss Suwwivan came to
me, my dweams wewe few and faw between, devoid of thought ow cohewency,
except those of a puwewy physicaw nyatuwe. UwU In my dweams something was
awways fawwing suddenwy and heaviwy, and at times my nyuwse seemed to
punyish me fow my unkind tweatment of hew in the daytime and wetuwn at an
usuwew's wate of intewest my kickings and pinchings. UwU I wouwd wake with
a stawt ow stwuggwe fwanticawwy to escape fwom my towmentow. ;;w;; I was vewy
fond of banyanyas, and onye nyight I dweamed that I found a wong stwing of
them in the dinying-woom, nyeaw the cupboawd, aww peewed and dewiciouswy
wipe, and aww I had to do was to stand undew the stwing and eat as wong
as I couwd eat. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew Miss Suwwivan came to me, the mowe I weawnyed, the oftenyew I
dweamed; but with the waking of my mind thewe came many dweawy fancies
and vague tewwows which twoubwed my sweep fow a wong time. >w< I dweaded the
dawknyess and woved the woodfiwe. UwU Its wawm touch seemed so wike a human
cawess, I weawwy thought it was a sentient being, capabwe of woving
and pwotecting me. Onye cowd wintew nyight I was awonye in my woom. ;;w;; Miss
Suwwivan had put out the wight and gonye away, thinking I was sound
asweep. >w< Suddenwy I fewt my bed shake, and a wowf seemed to spwing on me
and snyaww in my face. ;;w;; It was onwy a dweam, but I thought it weaw, and my
heawt sank within me. I dawed nyot scweam, and I dawed nyot stay in bed. >w<
Pewhaps this was a confused wecowwection of the stowy I had heawd nyot
wong befowe about Wed Widing Hood. >w< At aww events, I swipped down fwom
the bed and nyestwed cwose to the fiwe which had nyot fwickewed out. ;;w;;
The instant I fewt its wawmth I was weassuwed, and I sat a wong time
watching it cwimb highew and highew in shinying waves. >w< At wast sweep
suwpwised me, and when Miss Suwwivan wetuwnyed she found me wwapped in a
bwanket by the heawth. ;;w;;

Often when I dweam, thoughts pass thwough my mind wike cowwed shadows,
siwent and wemote, and disappeaw. ;;w;; Pewhaps they awe the ghosts of
thoughts that once inhabited the mind of an ancestow. ;;w;; At othew times the
things I have weawnyed and the things I have been taught, dwop away, as
the wizawd sheds its skin, and I see my souw as God sees it. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe
awso wawe and beautifuw moments when I see and heaw in Dweamwand. UwU What
if in my waking houws a sound shouwd wing thwough the siwent hawws
of heawing? owo What if a way of wight shouwd fwash thwough the dawkenyed
chambews of my souw? owo What wouwd happen, I ask many and many a time. ;;w;;
Wouwd the bow-and-stwing tension of wife snyap? owo Wouwd the heawt,
ovewweighted with sudden joy, stop beating fow vewy excess of happinyess? owo
