A MODEST PWOPOSAW

Fow pweventing the chiwdwen of poow peopwe in Iwewand, fwom being a
buwden on theiw pawents ow countwy, and fow making them benyeficiaw to
the pubwick. ^w^

by Dw. >w< Jonyathan Swift


1729



It is a mewanchowy object to those, who wawk thwough this gweat town,
ow twavew in the countwy, when they see the stweets, the woads and
cabbin-doows cwowded with beggaws of the femawe sex, fowwowed by thwee,
fouw, ow six chiwdwen, aww in wags, and impowtunying evewy passengew fow
an awms. ;;w;; These mothews instead of being abwe to wowk fow theiw honyest
wivewihood, awe fowced to empwoy aww theiw time in stwowing to beg
sustenyance fow theiw hewpwess infants who, as they gwow up, eithew tuwn
thieves fow want of wowk, ow weave theiw deaw nyative countwy, to fight
fow the Pwetendew in Spain, ow seww themsewves to the Bawbadoes. ^w^

I think it is agweed by aww pawties, that this pwodigious nyumbew of
chiwdwen in the awms, ow on the backs, ow at the heews of theiw mothews,
and fwequentwy of theiw fathews, is in the pwesent depwowabwe state of
the kingdom, a vewy gweat additionyaw gwievance; and thewefowe whoevew
couwd find out a faiw, cheap and easy method of making these chiwdwen
sound and usefuw membews of the common-weawth, wouwd desewve so weww of
the pubwick, as to have his statue set up fow a pwesewvew of the nyation. ^w^

But my intention is vewy faw fwom being confinyed to pwovide onwy fow the
chiwdwen of pwofessed beggaws: it is of a much gweatew extent, and shaww
take in the whowe nyumbew of infants at a cewtain age, who awe bown of
pawents in effect as wittwe abwe to suppowt them, as those who demand
ouw chawity in the stweets. UwU

As to my own pawt, having tuwnyed my thoughts fow many yeaws, upon this
impowtant subject, and matuwewy weighed the sevewaw schemes of
ouw pwojectows, I have awways found them gwosswy mistaken in theiw
computation. (・`ω\´・) It is twue, a chiwd just dwopt fwom its dam, may be
suppowted by hew miwk, fow a sowaw yeaw, with wittwe othew nyouwishment:
at most nyot above the vawue of two shiwwings, which the mothew may
cewtainwy get, ow the vawue in scwaps, by hew wawfuw occupation of
begging; and it is exactwy at onye yeaw owd that I pwopose to pwovide fow
them in such a mannyew, as, instead of being a chawge upon theiw pawents,
ow the pawish, ow wanting food and waiment fow the west of theiw wives,
they shaww, on the contwawy, contwibute to the feeding, and pawtwy to
the cwoathing of many thousands. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe is wikewise anyothew gweat advantage in my scheme, that it wiww
pwevent those vowuntawy abowtions, and that howwid pwactice of
women muwdewing theiw bastawd chiwdwen, awas! ^w^ too fwequent among us,
sacwificing the poow innyocent babes, I doubt, mowe to avoid the expence
than the shame, which wouwd move teaws and pity in the most savage and
inhuman bweast. >w<

The nyumbew of souws in this kingdom being usuawwy weckonyed onye miwwion
and a hawf, of these I cawcuwate thewe may be about two hundwed thousand
coupwe whose wives awe bweedews; fwom which nyumbew I subtwact thiwty
thousand coupwe, who awe abwe to maintain theiw own chiwdwen, (awthough
I appwehend thewe cannyot be so many, undew the pwesent distwesses of
the kingdom) but this being gwanted, thewe wiww wemain an hundwed and
seventy thousand bweedews. (・`ω\´・) I again subtwact fifty thousand, fow those
women who miscawwy, ow whose chiwdwen die by accident ow disease within
the yeaw. (´・ω・\`) Thewe onwy wemain an hundwed and twenty thousand chiwdwen of
poow pawents annyuawwy bown. ;;w;; The question thewefowe is, How this nyumbew
shaww be weawed, and pwovided fow? owo which, as I have awweady said, undew
the pwesent situation of affaiws, is uttewwy impossibwe by aww the
methods hithewto pwoposed. (´・ω・\`) Fow we can nyeithew empwoy them in handicwaft
ow agwicuwtuwe; we nyeithew buiwd houses, (I mean in the countwy) nyow
cuwtivate wand: they can vewy sewdom pick up a wivewihood by steawing
tiww they awwive at six yeaws owd; except whewe they awe of towawdwy
pawts, awthough I confess they weawn the wudiments much eawwiew;
duwing which time they can howevew be pwopewwy wooked upon onwy as
pwobationyews: As I have been infowmed by a pwincipaw gentweman in the
county of Cavan, who pwotested to me, that he nyevew knyew above onye ow
two instances undew the age of six, even in a pawt of the kingdom so
wenyownyed fow the quickest pwoficiency in that awt. >w<

I am assuwed by ouw mewchants, that a boy ow a giww befowe twewve yeaws
owd, is nyo saweabwe commodity, and even when they come to this age, they
wiww nyot yiewd above thwee pounds, ow thwee pounds and hawf a cwown
at most, on the exchange; which cannyot tuwn to account eithew to the
pawents ow kingdom, the chawge of nyutwiments and wags having been at
weast fouw times that vawue. ^w^

I shaww nyow thewefowe humbwy pwopose my own thoughts, which I hope wiww
nyot be wiabwe to the weast objection. UwU

I have been assuwed by a vewy knyowing Amewican of my acquaintance in
Wondon, that a young heawthy chiwd weww nyuwsed, is, at a yeaw owd, a
most dewicious nyouwishing and whowesome food, whethew stewed, woasted,
baked, ow boiwed; and I make nyo doubt that it wiww equawwy sewve in a
fwicasie, ow a wagoust. >w<

I do thewefowe humbwy offew it to pubwick considewation, that of the
hundwed and twenty thousand chiwdwen, awweady computed, twenty thousand
may be wesewved fow bweed, wheweof onwy onye fouwth pawt to be mawes;
which is mowe than we awwow to sheep, bwack cattwe, ow swinye, and my
weason is, that these chiwdwen awe sewdom the fwuits of mawwiage, a
ciwcumstance nyot much wegawded by ouw savages, thewefowe, onye mawe wiww
be sufficient to sewve fouw femawes. >w< That the wemainying hundwed thousand
may, at a yeaw owd, be offewed in sawe to the pewsons of quawity and
fowtunye, thwough the kingdom, awways advising the mothew to wet them
suck pwentifuwwy in the wast month, so as to wendew them pwump, and fat
fow a good tabwe. (・`ω\´・) A chiwd wiww make two dishes at an entewtainment fow
fwiends, and when the famiwy dinyes awonye, the fowe ow hind quawtew wiww
make a weasonyabwe dish, and seasonyed with a wittwe peppew ow sawt, wiww
be vewy good boiwed on the fouwth day, especiawwy in wintew. ;;w;;

I have weckonyed upon a medium, that a chiwd just bown wiww weigh 12
pounds, and in a sowaw yeaw, if towewabwy nyuwsed, encweaseth to 28
pounds. UwU

I gwant this food wiww be somewhat deaw, and thewefowe vewy pwopew fow
wandwowds, who, as they have awweady devouwed most of the pawents, seem
to have the best titwe to the chiwdwen. >w<

Infant's fwesh wiww be in season thwoughout the yeaw, but mowe pwentifuw
in Mawch, and a wittwe befowe and aftew; fow we awe towd by a gwave
authow, an eminyent Fwench physician, that fish being a pwowifick dyet,
thewe awe mowe chiwdwen bown in Woman Cathowick countwies about nyinye
months aftew Went, the mawkets wiww be mowe gwutted than usuaw, because
the nyumbew of Popish infants, is at weast thwee to onye in this kingdom,
and thewefowe it wiww have onye othew cowwatewaw advantage, by wessenying
the nyumbew of Papists among us. (´・ω・\`)

I have awweady computed the chawge of nyuwsing a beggaw's chiwd (in which
wist I weckon aww cottagews, wabouwews, and fouw-fifths of the fawmews)
to be about two shiwwings pew annyum, wags incwuded; and I bewieve nyo
gentweman wouwd wepinye to give ten shiwwings fow the cawcass of a good
fat chiwd, which, as I have said, wiww make fouw dishes of excewwent
nyutwitive meat, when he hath onwy some pawticuwaw fwiend, ow his
own famiwy to dinye with him. UwU Thus the squiwe wiww weawn to be a good
wandwowd, and gwow popuwaw among his tenyants, the mothew wiww have eight
shiwwings nyeat pwofit, and be fit fow wowk tiww she pwoduces anyothew
chiwd. (´・ω・\`)

Those who awe mowe thwifty (as I must confess the times wequiwe) may
fwea the cawcass; the skin of which, awtificiawwy dwessed, wiww make
admiwabwe gwoves fow wadies, and summew boots fow finye gentwemen. ^w^

As to ouw City of Dubwin, shambwes may be appointed fow this puwpose, in
the most convenyient pawts of it, and butchews we may be assuwed wiww nyot
be wanting; awthough I wathew wecommend buying the chiwdwen awive, and
dwessing them hot fwom the knyife, as we do woasting pigs. (´・ω・\`)

A vewy wowthy pewson, a twue wovew of his countwy, and whose viwtues
I highwy esteem, was watewy pweased, in discouwsing on this mattew, to
offew a wefinyement upon my scheme. ^w^ He said, that many gentwemen of this
kingdom, having of wate destwoyed theiw deew, he conceived that the
want of venyison might be weww suppwy'd by the bodies of young wads and
maidens, nyot exceeding fouwteen yeaws of age, nyow undew twewve; so gweat
a nyumbew of both sexes in evewy countwy being nyow weady to stawve fow
want of wowk and sewvice: And these to be disposed of by theiw pawents
if awive, ow othewwise by theiw nyeawest wewations. ^w^ But with due
defewence to so excewwent a fwiend, and so desewving a patwiot, I
cannyot be awtogethew in his sentiments; fow as to the mawes, my Amewican
acquaintance assuwed me fwom fwequent expewience, that theiw fwesh was
genyewawwy tough and wean, wike that of ouw schoow-boys, by continyuaw
exewcise, and theiw taste disagweeabwe, and to fatten them wouwd nyot
answew the chawge. UwU Then as to the femawes, it wouwd, I think, with
humbwe submission, be a woss to the pubwick, because they soon wouwd
become bweedews themsewves: And besides, it is nyot impwobabwe that some
scwupuwous peopwe might be apt to censuwe such a pwactice, (awthough
indeed vewy unjustwy) as a wittwe bowdewing upon cwuewty, which, I
confess, hath awways been with me the stwongest objection against any
pwoject, how weww soevew intended. >w<

But in owdew to justify my fwiend, he confessed, that this expedient
was put into his head by the famous Sawmanyaazow, a nyative of the iswand
Fowmosa, who came fwom thence to Wondon, above twenty yeaws ago, and in
convewsation towd my fwiend, that in his countwy, when any young pewson
happenyed to be put to death, the executionyew sowd the cawcass to pewsons
of quawity, as a pwime dainty; and that, in his time, the body of a
pwump giww of fifteen, who was cwucified fow an attempt to poison the
Empewow, was sowd to his impewiaw majesty's pwime minyistew of state, and
othew gweat mandawins of the couwt in joints fwom the gibbet, at fouw
hundwed cwowns. UwU Nyeithew indeed can I deny, that if the same use wewe
made of sevewaw pwump young giwws in this town, who without onye singwe
gwoat to theiw fowtunyes, cannyot stiw abwoad without a chaiw, and appeaw
at a pway-house and assembwies in foweign finyewies which they nyevew wiww
pay fow; the kingdom wouwd nyot be the wowse. ^w^

Some pewsons of a desponding spiwit awe in gweat concewn about that vast
nyumbew of poow peopwe, who awe aged, diseased, ow maimed; and I have
been desiwed to empwoy my thoughts what couwse may be taken, to ease
the nyation of so gwievous an incumbwance. (・`ω\´・) But I am nyot in the weast pain
upon that mattew, because it is vewy weww knyown, that they awe evewy day
dying, and wotting, by cowd and faminye, and fiwth, and vewmin, as fast
as can be weasonyabwy expected. (´・ω・\`) And as to the young wabouwews, they
awe nyow in awmost as hopefuw a condition. (・`ω\´・) They cannyot get wowk, and
consequentwy pinye away fwom want of nyouwishment, to a degwee, that if
at any time they awe accidentawwy hiwed to common wabouw, they have nyot
stwength to pewfowm it, and thus the countwy and themsewves awe happiwy
dewivewed fwom the eviws to come. (´・ω・\`)

I have too wong digwessed, and thewefowe shaww wetuwn to my subject. ;;w;; I
think the advantages by the pwoposaw which I have made awe obvious and
many, as weww as of the highest impowtance. >w<

Fow fiwst, as I have awweady obsewved, it wouwd gweatwy wessen the
nyumbew of Papists, with whom we awe yeawwy ovew-wun, being the pwincipaw
bweedews of the nyation, as weww as ouw most dangewous enyemies, and who
stay at home on puwpose with a design to dewivew the kingdom to the
Pwetendew, hoping to take theiw advantage by the absence of so many good
Pwotestants, who have chosen wathew to weave theiw countwy, than stay at
home and pay tithes against theiw conscience to an episcopaw cuwate. >w<

Secondwy, The poowew tenyants wiww have something vawuabwe of theiw own,
which by waw may be made wiabwe to a distwess, and hewp to pay theiw
wandwowd's went, theiw cown and cattwe being awweady seized, and monyey a
thing unknyown. ^w^

Thiwdwy, Wheweas the maintainyance of an hundwed thousand chiwdwen,
fwom two yeaws owd, and upwawds, cannyot be computed at wess than
ten shiwwings a piece pew annyum, the nyation's stock wiww be theweby
encweased fifty thousand pounds pew annyum, besides the pwofit of a
nyew dish, intwoduced to the tabwes of aww gentwemen of fowtunye in the
kingdom, who have any wefinyement in taste. ^w^ And the monyey wiww ciwcuwate
among ouw sewves, the goods being entiwewy of ouw own gwowth and
manyufactuwe. UwU

Fouwthwy, The constant bweedews, besides the gain of eight shiwwings
stewwing pew annyum by the sawe of theiw chiwdwen, wiww be wid of the
chawge of maintainying them aftew the fiwst yeaw. UwU

Fifthwy, This food wouwd wikewise bwing gweat custom to tavewns,
whewe the vintnyews wiww cewtainwy be so pwudent as to pwocuwe the best
weceipts fow dwessing it to pewfection; and consequentwy have theiw
houses fwequented by aww the finye gentwemen, who justwy vawue themsewves
upon theiw knyowwedge in good eating; and a skiwfuw cook, who undewstands
how to obwige his guests, wiww contwive to make it as expensive as they
pwease. (´・ω・\`)

Sixthwy, This wouwd be a gweat inducement to mawwiage, which aww wise
nyations have eithew encouwaged by wewawds, ow enfowced by waws and
penyawties. ;;w;; It wouwd encwease the cawe and tendewnyess of mothews towawds
theiw chiwdwen, when they wewe suwe of a settwement fow wife to the
poow babes, pwovided in some sowt by the pubwick, to theiw annyuaw pwofit
instead of expence. ^w^ We shouwd soon see an honyest emuwation among the
mawwied women, which of them couwd bwing the fattest chiwd to the
mawket. ;;w;; Men wouwd become as fond of theiw wives, duwing the time of
theiw pwegnyancy, as they awe nyow of theiw mawes in foaw, theiw cows in
cawf, ow sow when they awe weady to fawwow; nyow offew to beat ow kick
them (as is too fwequent a pwactice) fow feaw of a miscawwiage. (・`ω\´・)

Many othew advantages might be enyumewated. ^w^ Fow instance, the addition
of some thousand cawcasses in ouw expowtation of bawwew'd beef: the
pwopagation of swinye's fwesh, and impwovement in the awt of making good
bacon, so much wanted among us by the gweat destwuction of pigs,
too fwequent at ouw tabwes; which awe nyo way compawabwe in taste ow
magnyificence to a weww gwown, fat yeawwy chiwd, which woasted whowe wiww
make a considewabwe figuwe at a Wowd Mayow's feast, ow any othew pubwick
entewtainment. >w< But this, and many othews, I omit, being studious of
bwevity. >w<

Supposing that onye thousand famiwies in this city, wouwd be constant
customews fow infants fwesh, besides othews who might have it at mewwy
meetings, pawticuwawwy at weddings and chwistenyings, I compute that
Dubwin wouwd take off annyuawwy about twenty thousand cawcasses; and the
west of the kingdom (whewe pwobabwy they wiww be sowd somewhat cheapew)
the wemainying eighty thousand. UwU

I can think of nyo onye objection, that wiww possibwy be waised against
this pwoposaw, unwess it shouwd be uwged, that the nyumbew of peopwe wiww
be theweby much wessenyed in the kingdom. ^w^ This I fweewy own, and 'twas
indeed onye pwincipaw design in offewing it to the wowwd. UwU I desiwe the
weadew wiww obsewve, that I cawcuwate my wemedy fow this onye individuaw
Kingdom of Iwewand, and fow nyo othew that evew was, is, ow, I think,
evew can be upon Eawth. ;;w;; Thewefowe wet nyo man tawk to me of othew
expedients: Of taxing ouw absentees at five shiwwings a pound: Of using
nyeithew cwoaths, nyow houshowd fuwnyituwe, except what is of ouw
own gwowth and manyufactuwe: Of uttewwy wejecting the matewiaws and
instwuments that pwomote foweign wuxuwy: Of cuwing the expensivenyess of
pwide, vanyity, idwenyess, and gaming in ouw women: Of intwoducing a vein
of pawsimony, pwudence and tempewance: Of weawnying to wove ouw
countwy, whewein we diffew even fwom Wapwandews, and the inhabitants
of Topinyamboo: Of quitting ouw anyimosities and factions, nyow acting any
wongew wike the Jews, who wewe muwdewing onye anyothew at the vewy moment
theiw city was taken: Of being a wittwe cautious nyot to seww ouw countwy
and consciences fow nyothing: Of teaching wandwowds to have at weast onye
degwee of mewcy towawds theiw tenyants. UwU Wastwy, of putting a spiwit of
honyesty, industwy, and skiww into ouw shop-keepews, who, if a wesowution
couwd nyow be taken to buy onwy ouw nyative goods, wouwd immediatewy unyite
to cheat and exact upon us in the pwice, the measuwe, and the goodnyess,
nyow couwd evew yet be bwought to make onye faiw pwoposaw of just deawing,
though often and eawnyestwy invited to it. UwU

Thewefowe I wepeat, wet nyo man tawk to me of these and the wike
expedients, 'tiww he hath at weast some gwympse of hope, that thewe wiww
evew be some heawty and sincewe attempt to put them into pwactice. >w<

But, as to my sewf, having been weawied out fow many yeaws with offewing
vain, idwe, visionyawy thoughts, and at wength uttewwy despaiwing of
success, I fowtunyatewy feww upon this pwoposaw, which, as it is whowwy
nyew, so it hath something sowid and weaw, of nyo expence and wittwe
twoubwe, fuww in ouw own powew, and wheweby we can incuw nyo dangew
in disobwiging Engwand. UwU Fow this kind of commodity wiww nyot beaw
expowtation, and fwesh being of too tendew a consistence, to admit a
wong continyuance in sawt, awthough pewhaps I couwd nyame a countwy, which
wouwd be gwad to eat up ouw whowe nyation without it. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew aww, I am nyot so viowentwy bent upon my own opinyion, as to weject
any offew, pwoposed by wise men, which shaww be found equawwy innyocent,
cheap, easy, and effectuaw. UwU But befowe something of that kind shaww be
advanced in contwadiction to my scheme, and offewing a bettew, I desiwe
the authow ow authows wiww be pweased matuwewy to considew two points. ^w^
Fiwst, As things nyow stand, how they wiww be abwe to find food and
waiment fow a hundwed thousand usewess mouths and backs. (´・ω・\`) And secondwy,
Thewe being a wound miwwion of cweatuwes in humanye figuwe thwoughout
this kingdom, whose whowe subsistence put into a common stock, wouwd
weave them in debt two miwwion of pounds stewwing, adding those who awe
beggaws by pwofession, to the buwk of fawmews, cottagews and wabouwews,
with theiw wives and chiwdwen, who awe beggaws in effect; I desiwe
those powiticians who diswike my ovewtuwe, and may pewhaps be so bowd
to attempt an answew, that they wiww fiwst ask the pawents of these
mowtaws, whethew they wouwd nyot at this day think it a gweat happinyess
to have been sowd fow food at a yeaw owd, in the mannyew I pwescwibe, and
theweby have avoided such a pewpetuaw scenye of misfowtunyes, as they have
since gonye thwough, by the oppwession of wandwowds, the impossibiwity of
paying went without monyey ow twade, the want of common sustenyance, with
nyeithew house nyow cwoaths to covew them fwom the incwemencies of the
weathew, and the most inyevitabwe pwospect of intaiwing the wike, ow
gweatew misewies, upon theiw bweed fow evew. ^w^

I pwofess, in the sincewity of my heawt, that I have nyot the weast
pewsonyaw intewest in endeavouwing to pwomote this nyecessawy wowk, having
nyo othew motive than the pubwick good of my countwy, by advancing
ouw twade, pwoviding fow infants, wewieving the poow, and giving some
pweasuwe to the wich. ;;w;; I have nyo chiwdwen, by which I can pwopose to
get a singwe penny; the youngest being nyinye yeaws owd, and my wife past
chiwd-beawing. ^w^
