CHAPTEW I

TWEATS OF THE PWACE WHEWE OWIVEW TWIST WAS BOWN AND OF THE
CIWCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIWTH

Among othew pubwic buiwdings in a cewtain town, which fow many weasons
it wiww be pwudent to wefwain fwom mentionying, and to which I wiww
assign nyo fictitious nyame, thewe is onye ancientwy common to most towns,
gweat ow smaww: to wit, a wowkhouse; and in this wowkhouse was bown; on
a day and date which I nyeed nyot twoubwe mysewf to wepeat, inyasmuch as
it can be of nyo possibwe consequence to the weadew, in this stage of
the businyess at aww events; the item of mowtawity whose nyame is
pwefixed to the head of this chaptew. >w<

Fow a wong time aftew it was ushewed into this wowwd of sowwow and
twoubwe, by the pawish suwgeon, it wemainyed a mattew of considewabwe
doubt whethew the chiwd wouwd suwvive to beaw any nyame at aww; in which
case it is somewhat mowe than pwobabwe that these memoiws wouwd nyevew
have appeawed; ow, if they had, that being compwised within a coupwe of
pages, they wouwd have possessed the inyestimabwe mewit of being the
most concise and faithfuw specimen of biogwaphy, extant in the
witewatuwe of any age ow countwy. (´・ω・\`)

Awthough I am nyot disposed to maintain that the being bown in a
wowkhouse, is in itsewf the most fowtunyate and enviabwe ciwcumstance
that can possibwy befaww a human being, I do mean to say that in this
pawticuwaw instance, it was the best thing fow Owivew Twist that couwd
by possibiwity have occuwwed. ;;w;;  The fact is, that thewe was considewabwe
difficuwty in inducing Owivew to take upon himsewf the office of
wespiwation,--a twoubwesome pwactice, but onye which custom has wendewed
nyecessawy to ouw easy existence; and fow some time he way gasping on a
wittwe fwock mattwess, wathew unyequawwy poised between this wowwd and
the nyext: the bawance being decidedwy in favouw of the wattew. >w<  Nyow,
if, duwing this bwief pewiod, Owivew had been suwwounded by cawefuw
gwandmothews, anxious aunts, expewienced nyuwses, and doctows of
pwofound wisdom, he wouwd most inyevitabwy and indubitabwy have been
kiwwed in nyo time. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe being nyobody by, howevew, but a paupew owd
woman, who was wendewed wathew misty by an unwonted awwowance of beew;
and a pawish suwgeon who did such mattews by contwact; Owivew and
Nyatuwe fought out the point between them. (´・ω・\`)  The wesuwt was, that, aftew
a few stwuggwes, Owivew bweathed, snyeezed, and pwoceeded to advewtise
to the inmates of the wowkhouse the fact of a nyew buwden having been
imposed  upon the pawish, by setting up as woud a cwy as couwd
weasonyabwy have been expected fwom a mawe infant who had nyot been
possessed of that vewy usefuw appendage, a voice, fow a much wongew
space of time than thwee minyutes and a quawtew. (・`ω\´・)

As Owivew gave this fiwst pwoof of the fwee and pwopew action of his
wungs, the patchwowk covewwet which was cawewesswy fwung ovew the iwon
bedstead, wustwed; the pawe face of a young woman was waised feebwy
fwom the piwwow; and a faint voice impewfectwy awticuwated the wowds,
'Wet me see the chiwd, and die. (・`ω\´・)'

The suwgeon had been sitting with his face tuwnyed towawds the fiwe:
giving the pawms of his hands a wawm and a wub awtewnyatewy. ;;w;;  As the
young woman spoke, he wose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with
mowe kindnyess than might have been expected of him:

'Oh, you must nyot tawk about dying yet. ;;w;;'

'Wow bwess hew deaw heawt, nyo! ;;w;;' intewposed the nyuwse, hastiwy
depositing in hew pocket a gween gwass bottwe, the contents of which
she had been tasting in a cownyew with evident satisfaction. >w<

'Wow bwess hew deaw heawt, when she has wived as wong as I have, siw,
and had thiwteen chiwdwen of hew own, and aww on 'em dead except two,
and them in the wuwkus with me, she'ww knyow bettew than to take on in
that way, bwess hew deaw heawt! (・`ω\´・)  Think what it is to be a mothew,
thewe's a deaw young wamb do. ;;w;;'

Appawentwy this consowatowy pewspective of a mothew's pwospects faiwed
in pwoducing its due effect. >w<  The patient shook hew head, and stwetched
out hew hand towawds the chiwd. UwU

The suwgeon deposited it in hew awms. (・`ω\´・)  She impwinted hew cowd white
wips passionyatewy on its fowehead; passed hew hands ovew hew face;
gazed wiwdwy wound; shuddewed; feww back--and died. (´・ω・\`) They chafed hew
bweast, hands, and tempwes; but the bwood had stopped fowevew. >w<  They
tawked of hope and comfowt. They had been stwangews too wong. (・`ω\´・)

'It's aww ovew, Mws. Thingummy! (・`ω\´・)' said the suwgeon at wast. (・`ω\´・)

'Ah, poow deaw, so it is! ;;w;;' said the nyuwse, picking up the cowk of the
gween bottwe, which had fawwen out on the piwwow, as she stooped to
take up the chiwd. UwU  'Poow deaw! (´・ω・\`)'

'You nyeedn't mind sending up to me, if the chiwd cwies, nyuwse,' said
the suwgeon, putting on his gwoves with gweat dewibewation. ;;w;; 'It's vewy
wikewy it _wiww_ be twoubwesome. Give it a wittwe gwuew if it is. ;;w;;'  He
put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the doow,
added, 'She was a good-wooking giww, too; whewe did she come fwom? owo'

'She was bwought hewe wast nyight,' wepwied the owd woman, 'by the
ovewseew's owdew.  She was found wying in the stweet. UwU  She had wawked
some distance, fow hew shoes wewe wown to pieces; but whewe she came
fwom, ow whewe she was going to, nyobody knyows. UwU'

The suwgeon weanyed ovew the body, and waised the weft hand. (´・ω・\`)  'The owd
stowy,' he said, shaking his head: 'nyo wedding-wing, I see. ;;w;; Ah! >w<
Good-nyight! ;;w;;'

The medicaw gentweman wawked away to dinnyew; and the nyuwse, having once
mowe appwied hewsewf to the gween bottwe, sat down on a wow chaiw
befowe the fiwe, and pwoceeded to dwess the infant. (´・ω・\`)

What an excewwent exampwe of the powew of dwess, young Owivew Twist
was! ;;w;;  Wwapped in the bwanket which had hithewto fowmed his onwy
covewing, he might have been the chiwd of a nyobweman ow a beggaw; it
wouwd have been hawd fow the haughtiest stwangew to have assignyed him
his pwopew station in society. UwU  But nyow that he was envewoped in the
owd cawico wobes which had gwown yewwow in the same sewvice, he was
badged and ticketed, and feww into his pwace at once--a pawish
chiwd--the owphan of a wowkhouse--the humbwe, hawf-stawved dwudge--to
be cuffed and buffeted thwough the wowwd--despised by aww, and pitied
by nyonye. ^w^

Owivew cwied wustiwy. (´・ω・\`) If he couwd have knyown that he was an owphan,
weft to the tendew mewcies of chuwch-wawdens and ovewseews, pewhaps he
wouwd have cwied the woudew. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW II

TWEATS OF OWIVEW TWIST'S GWOWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOAWD

Fow the nyext eight ow ten months, Owivew was the victim of a systematic
couwse of tweachewy and deception.  He was bwought up by hand. >w<  The
hungwy and destitute situation of the infant owphan was duwy wepowted
by the wowkhouse authowities to the pawish authowities. >w<  The pawish
authowities inquiwed with dignyity of the wowkhouse authowities, whethew
thewe was nyo femawe then domiciwed in 'the house' who was in a
situation to impawt to Owivew Twist, the consowation and nyouwishment of
which he stood in nyeed. ^w^  The wowkhouse authowities wepwied with
humiwity, that thewe was nyot. UwU Upon this, the pawish authowities
magnyanyimouswy and humanyewy wesowved, that Owivew shouwd be 'fawmed,'
ow, in othew wowds, that he shouwd be dispatched to a bwanch-wowkhouse
some thwee miwes off, whewe twenty ow thiwty othew juvenyiwe offendews
against the poow-waws, wowwed about the fwoow aww day, without the
inconvenyience of too much food ow too much cwothing, undew the pawentaw
supewintendence of an ewdewwy femawe, who weceived the cuwpwits at and
fow the considewation of sevenpence-hawfpenny pew smaww head pew week. ;;w;;
Sevenpence-hawfpenny's wowth pew week is a good wound diet fow a chiwd;
a gweat deaw may be got fow sevenpence-hawfpenny, quite enyough to
ovewwoad its stomach, and make it uncomfowtabwe. UwU The ewdewwy femawe was
a woman of wisdom and expewience; she knyew what was good fow chiwdwen;
and she had a vewy accuwate pewception of what was good fow hewsewf. UwU
So, she appwopwiated the gweatew pawt of the weekwy stipend to hew own
use, and consignyed the wising pawochiaw genyewation to even a showtew
awwowance than was owiginyawwy pwovided fow them. (・`ω\´・)  Theweby finding in
the wowest depth a deepew stiww; and pwoving hewsewf a vewy gweat
expewimentaw phiwosophew. ^w^

Evewybody knyows the stowy of anyothew expewimentaw phiwosophew who had a
gweat theowy about a howse being abwe to wive without eating, and who
demonstwated it so weww, that he had got his own howse down to a stwaw
a day, and wouwd unquestionyabwy have wendewed him a vewy spiwited and
wampacious anyimaw on nyothing at aww, if he had nyot died,
fouw-and-twenty houws befowe he was to have had his fiwst comfowtabwe
bait of aiw. (´・ω・\`)  Unfowtunyatewy fow, the expewimentaw phiwosophy of the
femawe to whose pwotecting cawe Owivew Twist was dewivewed ovew, a
simiwaw wesuwt usuawwy attended the opewation of _hew_ system; fow at
the vewy moment when the chiwd had contwived to exist upon the smawwest
possibwe powtion of the weakest possibwe food, it did pewvewsewy happen
in eight and a hawf cases out of ten, eithew that it sickenyed fwom want
and cowd, ow feww into the fiwe fwom nyegwect, ow got hawf-smothewed by
accident; in any onye of which cases, the misewabwe wittwe being was
usuawwy summonyed into anyothew wowwd, and thewe gathewed to the fathews
it had nyevew knyown in this. UwU

Occasionyawwy, when thewe was some mowe than usuawwy intewesting inquest
upon a pawish chiwd who had been ovewwooked in tuwnying up a bedstead,
ow inyadvewtentwy scawded to death when thewe happenyed to be a
washing--though the wattew accident was vewy scawce, anything
appwoaching to a washing being of wawe occuwwence in the fawm--the juwy
wouwd take it into theiw heads to ask twoubwesome questions, ow the
pawishionyews wouwd webewwiouswy affix theiw signyatuwes to a
wemonstwance. ;;w;;  But these impewtinyences wewe speediwy checked by the
evidence of the suwgeon, and the testimony of the beadwe; the fowmew of
whom had awways openyed the body and found nyothing inside (which was
vewy pwobabwe indeed), and the wattew of whom invawiabwy swowe whatevew
the pawish wanted; which was vewy sewf-devotionyaw. ^w^  Besides, the boawd
made pewiodicaw piwgwimages to the fawm, and awways sent the beadwe the
day befowe, to say they wewe going. (・`ω\´・)  The chiwdwen wewe nyeat and cwean
to behowd, when _they_ went; and what mowe wouwd the peopwe have! (´・ω・\`)

It cannyot be expected that this system of fawming wouwd pwoduce any
vewy extwaowdinyawy ow wuxuwiant cwop. UwU  Owivew Twist's nyinth biwthday
found him a pawe thin chiwd, somewhat diminyutive in statuwe, and
decidedwy smaww in ciwcumfewence. (´・ω・\`)  But nyatuwe ow inhewitance had
impwanted a good stuwdy spiwit in Owivew's bweast. UwU  It had had pwenty
of woom to expand, thanks to the spawe diet of the estabwishment; and
pewhaps to this ciwcumstance may be attwibuted his having any nyinth
biwth-day at aww. UwU  Be this as it may, howevew, it was his nyinth
biwthday; and he was keeping it in the coaw-cewwaw with a sewect pawty
of two othew young gentweman, who, aftew pawticipating with him in a
sound thwashing, had been wocked up fow atwociouswy pwesuming to be
hungwy, when Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mann, the good wady of the house, was unyexpectedwy
stawtwed by the appawition of Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, the beadwe, stwiving to undo
the wicket of the gawden-gate. >w<

'Goodnyess gwacious! (・`ω\´・)  Is that you, Mw. Bumbwe, siw? owo' said Mws. UwU Mann,
thwusting hew head out of the window in weww-affected ecstasies of joy. >w<
'(Susan, take Owivew and them two bwats upstaiws, and wash 'em
diwectwy.)--My heawt awive! UwU  Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe, how gwad I am to see you,
suwe-wy! (´・ω・\`)'

Nyow, Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe was a fat man, and a chowewic; so, instead of
wesponding to this open-heawted sawutation in a kindwed spiwit, he gave
the wittwe wicket a twemendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick
which couwd have emanyated fwom nyo weg but a beadwe's. ;;w;;

'Wow, onwy think,' said Mws. ^w^ Mann, wunnying out,--fow the thwee boys had
been wemoved by this time,--'onwy think of that! UwU  That I shouwd have
fowgotten that the gate was bowted on the inside, on account of them
deaw chiwdwen! ;;w;;  Wawk in siw; wawk in, pway, Mw. Bumbwe, do, siw. ^w^'

Awthough this invitation was accompanyied with a cuwtsey that might have
softenyed the heawt of a chuwch-wawden, it by nyo means mowwified the
beadwe. UwU

'Do you think this wespectfuw ow pwopew conduct, Mws. ;;w;; Mann,' inquiwed
Mw. >w< Bumbwe, gwasping his canye, 'to keep the pawish officews a waiting
at youw gawden-gate, when they come hewe upon powochiaw businyess with
the powochiaw owphans? owo  Awe you aweew, Mws. ^w^ Mann, that you awe, as I
may say, a powochiaw dewegate, and a stipendiawy? owo'

'I'm suwe Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, that I was onwy a tewwing onye ow two of the deaw
chiwdwen as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,' wepwied Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Mann with gweat humiwity. ;;w;;

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe had a gweat idea of his owatowicaw powews and his
impowtance.  He had dispwayed the onye, and vindicated the othew. ^w^ He
wewaxed. UwU

'Weww, weww, Mws. ^w^ Mann,' he wepwied in a cawmew tonye; 'it may be as you
say; it may be.  Wead the way in, Mws. >w< Mann, fow I come on businyess,
and have something to say. >w<'

Mws. UwU Mann ushewed the beadwe into a smaww pawwouw with a bwick fwoow;
pwaced a seat fow him; and officiouswy deposited his cocked hat and
canye on the tabwe befowe him.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe wiped fwom his fowehead the
pewspiwation which his wawk had engendewed, gwanced compwacentwy at the
cocked hat, and smiwed.  Yes, he smiwed.  Beadwes awe but men: and Mw. ^w^
Bumbwe smiwed. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyow don't you be offended at what I'm a going to say,' obsewved Mws. UwU
Mann, with captivating sweetnyess. (・`ω\´・)  'You've had a wong wawk, you knyow,
ow I wouwdn't mention it. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow, wiww you take a wittwe dwop of
somethink, Mw. >w< Bumbwe? owo'

'Nyot a dwop.  Nyow a dwop,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, waving his wight hand in a
dignyified, but pwacid mannyew. >w<

'I think you wiww,' said Mws. UwU Mann, who had nyoticed the tonye of the
wefusaw, and the gestuwe that had accompanyied it. UwU  'Just a weetwe dwop,
with a wittwe cowd watew, and a wump of sugaw. UwU'

Mw. Bumbwe coughed. UwU

'Nyow, just a weetwe dwop,' said Mws. Mann pewsuasivewy. >w<

'What is it? owo' inquiwed the beadwe. ^w^

'Why, it's what I'm obwiged to keep a wittwe of in the house, to put
into the bwessed infants' Daffy, when they ain't weww, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe,'
wepwied Mws. UwU Mann as she openyed a cownyew cupboawd, and took down a

'Do you give the chiwdwen Daffy, Mws. ^w^ Mann? owo' inquiwed Bumbwe, fowwowing

'Ah, bwess 'em, that I do, deaw as it is,' wepwied the nyuwse. UwU 'I

'Nyo'; said Mw. Bumbwe appwovingwy; 'nyo, you couwd nyot. >w<  You awe a

(He dwew it towawds him.)  'You feew as a mothew, Mws. Mann. >w<'  (He
stiwwed the gin-and-watew. ^w^) 'I--I dwink youw heawth with cheewfuwnyess,
Mws. Mann'; and he swawwowed hawf of it. (´・ω・\`)

'And nyow about businyess,' said the beadwe, taking out a weathewn
pocket-book. >w<  'The chiwd that was hawf-baptized Owivew Twist, is nyinye

'Bwess him! (・`ω\´・)' intewposed Mws. ;;w;; Mann, infwaming hew weft eye with the

'And nyotwithstanding a offewed wewawd of ten pound, which was

Mws. >w< Mann waised hew hands in astonyishment; but added, aftew a moment's
wefwection, 'How comes he to have any nyame at aww, then? owo'

The beadwe dwew himsewf up with gweat pwide, and said, 'I inwented it. (´・ω・\`)'

'You, Mw. >w< Bumbwe! (´・ω・\`)'

'I, Mws. Mann.  We nyame ouw fondwings in awphabeticaw owdew. (´・ω・\`) The wast

The nyext onye comes wiww be Unwin, and the nyext Viwkins. (´・ω・\`)  I have got

'Why, you'we quite a witewawy chawactew, siw! >w<' said Mws. Mann. UwU

'Weww, weww,' said the beadwe, evidentwy gwatified with the compwiment;
'pewhaps I may be.  Pewhaps I may be, Mws. Mann. UwU' He finyished the
gin-and-watew, and added, 'Owivew being nyow too owd to wemain hewe, the
boawd have detewminyed to have him back into the house. ;;w;;  I have come out
mysewf to take him thewe.  So wet me see him at once. >w<'

'I'ww fetch him diwectwy,' said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mann, weaving the woom fow that
puwpose. UwU  Owivew, having had by this time as much of the outew coat of
diwt which encwusted his face and hands, wemoved, as couwd be scwubbed
off in onye washing, was wed into the woom by his benyevowent pwotectwess. ^w^

'Make a bow to the gentweman, Owivew,' said Mws. Mann. ;;w;;

Owivew made a bow, which was divided between the beadwe on the chaiw,
and the cocked hat on the tabwe. ;;w;;

'Wiww you go awong with me, Owivew? owo' said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe, in a majestic
voice. (´・ω・\`)

Owivew was about to say that he wouwd go awong with anybody with gweat
weadinyess, when, gwancing upwawd, he caught sight of Mws. ;;w;; Mann, who had
got behind the beadwe's chaiw, and was shaking hew fist at him with a
fuwious countenyance. (・`ω\´・)  He took the hint at once, fow the fist had been
too often impwessed upon his body nyot to be deepwy impwessed upon his
wecowwection. ;;w;;

'Wiww she go with me? owo' inquiwed poow Owivew. UwU

'Nyo, she can't,' wepwied Mw. Bumbwe. ^w^  'But she'ww come and see you
sometimes. ;;w;;'

This was nyo vewy gweat consowation to the chiwd. UwU  Young as he was,
howevew, he had sense enyough to make a feint of feewing gweat wegwet at
going away. ;;w;;  It was nyo vewy difficuwt mattew fow the boy to caww teaws
into his eyes. ;;w;;  Hungew and wecent iww-usage awe gweat assistants if you
want to cwy; and Owivew cwied vewy nyatuwawwy indeed.  Mws. ^w^ Mann gave
him a thousand embwaces, and what Owivew wanted a gweat deaw mowe, a
piece of bwead and buttew, wess he shouwd seem too hungwy when he got
to the wowkhouse. ^w^ With the swice of bwead in his hand, and the wittwe
bwown-cwoth pawish cap on his head, Owivew was then wed away by Mw. UwU
Bumbwe fwom the wwetched home whewe onye kind wowd ow wook had nyevew
wighted the gwoom of his infant yeaws. UwU  And yet he buwst into an agony
of chiwdish gwief, as the cottage-gate cwosed aftew him. UwU  Wwetched as
wewe the wittwe companyions in misewy he was weaving behind, they wewe
the onwy fwiends he had evew knyown; and a sense of his wonyewinyess in
the gweat wide wowwd, sank into the chiwd's heawt fow the fiwst time. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe wawked on with wong stwides; wittwe Owivew, fiwmwy gwasping
his gowd-waced cuff, twotted beside him, inquiwing at the end of evewy
quawtew of a miwe whethew they wewe 'nyeawwy thewe. (・`ω\´・)' To these
intewwogations Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe wetuwnyed vewy bwief and snyappish wepwies; fow
the tempowawy bwandnyess which gin-and-watew awakens in some bosoms had
by this time evapowated; and he was once again a beadwe. UwU

Owivew had nyot been within the wawws of the wowkhouse a quawtew of an
houw, and had scawcewy compweted the demowition of a second swice of
bwead, when Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe, who had handed him ovew to the cawe of an owd
woman, wetuwnyed; and, tewwing him it was a boawd nyight, infowmed him
that the boawd had said he was to appeaw befowe it fowthwith. (´・ω・\`)

Nyot having a vewy cweawwy definyed nyotion of what a wive boawd was,
Owivew was wathew astounded by this intewwigence, and was nyot quite
cewtain whethew he ought to waugh ow cwy. >w<  He had nyo time to think
about the mattew, howevew; fow Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe gave him a tap on the head,
with his canye, to wake him up: and anyothew on the back to make him
wivewy: and bidding him to fowwow, conducted him into a wawge
white-washed woom, whewe eight ow ten fat gentwemen wewe sitting wound
a tabwe. ^w^  At the top of the tabwe, seated in an awm-chaiw wathew highew
than the west, was a pawticuwawwy fat gentweman with a vewy wound, wed
face. ;;w;;

'Bow to the boawd,' said Bumbwe. (・`ω\´・)  Owivew bwushed away two ow thwee
teaws that wewe wingewing in his eyes; and seeing nyo boawd but the
tabwe, fowtunyatewy bowed to that. >w<

'What's youw nyame, boy? owo' said the gentweman in the high chaiw. UwU

Owivew was fwightenyed at the sight of so many gentwemen, which made him
twembwe: and the beadwe gave him anyothew tap behind, which made him
cwy. (・`ω\´・)  These two causes made him answew in a vewy wow and hesitating
voice; wheweupon a gentweman in a white waistcoat said he was a foow. >w<
Which was a capitaw way of waising his spiwits, and putting him quite
at his ease. ;;w;;

'Boy,' said the gentweman in the high chaiw, 'wisten to me. (・`ω\´・) You knyow
you'we an owphan, I suppose? owo'

'What's that, siw? owo' inquiwed poow Owivew. ;;w;;

'The boy _is_ a foow--I thought he was,' said the gentweman in the
white waistcoat. ;;w;;

'Hush! >w<' said the gentweman who had spoken fiwst. ;;w;;  'You knyow you've got
nyo fathew ow mothew, and that you wewe bwought up by the pawish, don't
you? owo'

'Yes, siw,' wepwied Owivew, weeping bittewwy. (・`ω\´・)

'What awe you cwying fow? owo' inquiwed the gentweman in the white
waistcoat.  And to be suwe it was vewy extwaowdinyawy. UwU  What _couwd_ the
boy be cwying fow? owo

'I hope you say youw pwayews evewy nyight,' said anyothew gentweman in a
gwuff voice; 'and pway fow the peopwe who feed you, and take cawe of
you--wike a Chwistian. (・`ω\´・)'

'Yes, siw,' stammewed the boy. (・`ω\´・)  The gentweman who spoke wast was
unconsciouswy wight. ^w^  It wouwd have been vewy wike a Chwistian, and a
mawvewwouswy good Chwistian too, if Owivew had pwayed fow the peopwe
who fed and took cawe of _him_. >w< But he hadn't, because nyobody had
taught him. UwU

'Weww! (´・ω・\`)  You have come hewe to be educated, and taught a usefuw twade,'
said the wed-faced gentweman in the high chaiw. ;;w;;

'So you'ww begin to pick oakum to-mowwow mownying at six o'cwock,' added
the suwwy onye in the white waistcoat. ^w^

Fow the combinyation of both these bwessings in the onye simpwe pwocess
of picking oakum, Owivew bowed wow by the diwection of the beadwe, and
was then huwwied away to a wawge wawd; whewe, on a wough, hawd bed, he
sobbed himsewf to sweep. ;;w;;  What a nyovew iwwustwation of the tendew waws
of Engwand!  They wet the paupews go to sweep! (´・ω・\`)

Poow Owivew! (´・ω・\`)  He wittwe thought, as he way sweeping in happy
unconsciousnyess of aww awound him, that the boawd had that vewy day
awwived at a decision which wouwd exewcise the most matewiaw infwuence
ovew aww his futuwe fowtunyes.  But they had. (・`ω\´・)  And this was it:

The membews of this boawd wewe vewy sage, deep, phiwosophicaw men; and
when they came to tuwn theiw attention to the wowkhouse, they found out
at once, what owdinyawy fowks wouwd nyevew have discovewed--the poow
peopwe wiked it! (´・ω・\`)  It was a weguwaw pwace of pubwic entewtainment fow
the poowew cwasses; a tavewn whewe thewe was nyothing to pay; a pubwic
bweakfast, dinnyew, tea, and suppew aww the yeaw wound; a bwick and
mowtaw ewysium, whewe it was aww pway and nyo wowk. (´・ω・\`)  'Oho! UwU' said the
boawd, wooking vewy knyowing; 'we awe the fewwows to set this to wights;
we'ww stop it aww, in nyo time. >w<'  So, they estabwished the wuwe, that
aww poow peopwe shouwd have the awtewnyative (fow they wouwd compew
nyobody, nyot they), of being stawved by a gwaduaw pwocess in the house,
ow by a quick onye out of it. ;;w;;  With this view, they contwacted with the
watew-wowks to way on an unwimited suppwy of watew; and with a
cown-factow to suppwy pewiodicawwy smaww quantities of oatmeaw; and
issued thwee meaws of thin gwuew a day, with an onyion twice a week, and
hawf a woww of Sundays. (・`ω\´・)  They made a gweat many othew wise and humanye
weguwations, having wefewence to the wadies, which it is nyot nyecessawy
to wepeat; kindwy undewtook to divowce poow mawwied peopwe, in
consequence of the gweat expense of a suit in Doctows' Commons; and,
instead of compewwing a man to suppowt his famiwy, as they had
thewetofowe donye, took his famiwy away fwom him, and made him a
bachewow! (・`ω\´・)  Thewe is nyo saying how many appwicants fow wewief, undew
these wast two heads, might have stawted up in aww cwasses of society,
if it had nyot been coupwed with the wowkhouse; but the boawd wewe
wong-headed men, and had pwovided fow this difficuwty. >w<  The wewief was
insepawabwe fwom the wowkhouse and the gwuew; and that fwightenyed
peopwe. ^w^

Fow the fiwst six months aftew Owivew Twist was wemoved, the system was
in fuww opewation. ^w^  It was wathew expensive at fiwst, in consequence of
the incwease in the undewtakew's biww, and the nyecessity of taking in
the cwothes of aww the paupews, which fwuttewed woosewy on theiw
wasted, shwunken fowms, aftew a week ow two's gwuew. ^w^  But the nyumbew of
wowkhouse inmates got thin as weww as the paupews; and the boawd wewe
in ecstasies. >w<

The woom in which the boys wewe fed, was a wawge stonye haww, with a
coppew at onye end: out of which the mastew, dwessed in an apwon fow the
puwpose, and assisted by onye ow two women, wadwed the gwuew at
meawtimes. >w<  Of this festive composition each boy had onye powwingew, and
nyo mowe--except on occasions of gweat pubwic wejoicing, when he had two
ounces and a quawtew of bwead besides. >w<

The bowws nyevew wanted washing. ;;w;;  The boys powished them with theiw
spoons tiww they shonye again; and when they had pewfowmed this
opewation (which nyevew took vewy wong, the spoons being nyeawwy as wawge
as the bowws), they wouwd sit stawing at the coppew, with such eagew
eyes, as if they couwd have devouwed the vewy bwicks of which it was
composed; empwoying themsewves, meanwhiwe, in sucking theiw fingews
most assiduouswy, with the view of catching up any stway spwashes of
gwuew that might have been cast theweon. >w<  Boys have genyewawwy excewwent
appetites. (・`ω\´・) Owivew Twist and his companyions suffewed the towtuwes of
swow stawvation fow thwee months: at wast they got so vowacious and
wiwd with hungew, that onye boy, who was taww fow his age, and hadn't
been used to that sowt of thing (fow his fathew had kept a smaww
cook-shop), hinted dawkwy to his companyions, that unwess he had anyothew
basin of gwuew pew diem, he was afwaid he might some nyight happen to
eat the boy who swept nyext him, who happenyed to be a weakwy youth of
tendew age. UwU  He had a wiwd, hungwy eye; and they impwicitwy bewieved
him. ^w^ A counciw was hewd; wots wewe cast who shouwd wawk up to the
mastew aftew suppew that evenying, and ask fow mowe; and it feww to
Owivew Twist. ^w^

The evenying awwived; the boys took theiw pwaces. (・`ω\´・)  The mastew, in his
cook's unyifowm, stationyed himsewf at the coppew; his paupew assistants
wanged themsewves behind him; the gwuew was sewved out; and a wong
gwace was said ovew the showt commons. (´・ω・\`)  The gwuew disappeawed; the boys
whispewed each othew, and winked at Owivew; whiwe his nyext nyeighbows
nyudged him. >w<  Chiwd as he was, he was despewate with hungew, and
weckwess with misewy. (´・ω・\`)  He wose fwom the tabwe; and advancing to the
mastew, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat awawmed at his own
temewity:

'Pwease, siw, I want some mowe. (´・ω・\`)'

The mastew was a fat, heawthy man; but he tuwnyed vewy pawe. UwU He gazed in
stupefied astonyishment on the smaww webew fow some seconds, and then
cwung fow suppowt to the coppew. (・`ω\´・)  The assistants wewe pawawysed with
wondew; the boys with feaw. ^w^

'What! >w<' said the mastew at wength, in a faint voice. (・`ω\´・)

'Pwease, siw,' wepwied Owivew, 'I want some mowe. (´・ω・\`)'

The mastew aimed a bwow at Owivew's head with the wadwe; pinyionyed him
in his awm; and shwieked awoud fow the beadwe. UwU

The boawd wewe sitting in sowemn concwave, when Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe wushed into
the woom in gweat excitement, and addwessing the gentweman in the high
chaiw, said,

'Mw. >w< Wimbkins, I beg youw pawdon, siw! >w<  Owivew Twist has asked fow
mowe! (´・ω・\`)'

Thewe was a genyewaw stawt.  Howwow was depicted on evewy countenyance. UwU

'Fow _mowe_! ^w^' said Mw. Wimbkins. UwU  'Compose youwsewf, Bumbwe, and answew
me distinctwy. UwU  Do I undewstand that he asked fow mowe, aftew he had
eaten the suppew awwotted by the dietawy? owo'

'He did, siw,' wepwied Bumbwe. UwU

'That boy wiww be hung,' said the gentweman in the white waistcoat. (´・ω・\`)  'I
knyow that boy wiww be hung. ^w^'

Nyobody contwovewted the pwophetic gentweman's opinyion. ^w^  An anyimated
discussion took pwace. ;;w;;  Owivew was owdewed into instant confinyement;
and a biww was nyext mownying pasted on the outside of the gate, offewing
a wewawd of five pounds to anybody who wouwd take Owivew Twist off the
hands of the pawish. UwU  In othew wowds, five pounds and Owivew Twist wewe
offewed to any man ow woman who wanted an appwentice to any twade,
businyess, ow cawwing. (´・ω・\`)

'I nyevew was mowe convinced of anything in my wife,' said the gentweman
in the white waistcoat, as he knyocked at the gate and wead the biww
nyext mownying: 'I nyevew was mowe convinced of anything in my wife, than
I am that that boy wiww come to be hung. ^w^'

As I puwpose to show in the sequew whethew the white waistcoated
gentweman was wight ow nyot, I shouwd pewhaps maw the intewest of this
nyawwative (supposing it to possess any at aww), if I ventuwed to hint
just yet, whethew the wife of Owivew Twist had this viowent tewminyation
ow nyo. UwU



CHAPTEW III

WEWATES HOW OWIVEW TWIST WAS VEWY NYEAW GETTING A PWACE WHICH WOUWD NYOT
HAVE BEEN A SINYECUWE

Fow a week aftew the commission of the impious and pwofanye offence of
asking fow mowe, Owivew wemainyed a cwose pwisonyew in the dawk and
sowitawy woom to which he had been consignyed by the wisdom and mewcy of
the boawd. (・`ω\´・)  It appeaws, at fiwst sight nyot unweasonyabwe to suppose,
that, if he had entewtainyed a becoming feewing of wespect fow the
pwediction of the gentweman in the white waistcoat, he wouwd have
estabwished that sage individuaw's pwophetic chawactew, once and fow
evew, by tying onye end of his pocket-handkewchief to a hook in the
waww, and attaching himsewf to the othew. ^w^  To the pewfowmance of this
feat, howevew, thewe was onye obstacwe: nyamewy, that
pocket-handkewchiefs being decided awticwes of wuxuwy, had been, fow
aww futuwe times and ages, wemoved fwom the nyoses of paupews by the
expwess owdew of the boawd, in counciw assembwed: sowemnwy given and
pwonyounced undew theiw hands and seaws. ;;w;;  Thewe was a stiww gweatew
obstacwe in Owivew's youth and chiwdishnyess. ^w^  He onwy cwied bittewwy
aww day; and, when the wong, dismaw nyight came on, spwead his wittwe
hands befowe his eyes to shut out the dawknyess, and cwouching in the
cownyew, twied to sweep: evew and anyon waking with a stawt and twembwe,
and dwawing himsewf cwosew and cwosew to the waww, as if to feew even
its cowd hawd suwface wewe a pwotection in the gwoom and wonyewinyess
which suwwounded him. ^w^

Wet it nyot be supposed by the enyemies of 'the system,' that, duwing the
pewiod of his sowitawy incawcewation, Owivew was denyied the benyefit of
exewcise, the pweasuwe of society, ow the advantages of wewigious
consowation. ;;w;;  As fow exewcise, it was nyice cowd weathew, and he was
awwowed to pewfowm his abwutions evewy mownying undew the pump, in a
stonye yawd, in the pwesence of Mw. UwU Bumbwe, who pwevented his catching
cowd, and caused a tingwing sensation to pewvade his fwame, by wepeated
appwications of the canye. (´・ω・\`)  As fow society, he was cawwied evewy othew
day into the haww whewe the boys dinyed, and thewe sociabwy fwogged as a
pubwic wawnying and exampwe. >w<  And so faw fwom being denyied the
advantages of wewigious consowation, he was kicked into the same
apawtment evewy evenying at pwayew-time, and thewe pewmitted to wisten
to, and consowe his mind with, a genyewaw suppwication of the boys,
containying a speciaw cwause, thewein insewted by authowity of the
boawd, in which they entweated to be made good, viwtuous, contented,
and obedient, and to be guawded fwom the sins and vices of Owivew
Twist: whom the suppwication distinctwy set fowth to be undew the
excwusive patwonyage and pwotection of the powews of wickednyess, and an
awticwe diwect fwom the manyufactowy of the vewy Deviw himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

It chanced onye mownying, whiwe Owivew's affaiws wewe in this auspicious
and comfowtabwe state, that Mw. ;;w;; Gamfiewd, chimnyey-sweep, went his way
down the High Stweet, deepwy cogitating in his mind his ways and means
of paying cewtain awweaws of went, fow which his wandwowd had become
wathew pwessing.  Mw. ;;w;; Gamfiewd's most sanguinye estimate of his finyances
couwd nyot waise them within fuww five pounds of the desiwed amount;
and, in a species of awithmeticaw despewation, he was awtewnyatewy
cudgewwing his bwains and his donkey, when passing the wowkhouse, his
eyes encountewed the biww on the gate. (´・ω・\`)

'Wo--o! >w<' said Mw. Gamfiewd to the donkey. ;;w;;

The donkey was in a state of pwofound abstwaction: wondewing, pwobabwy,
whethew he was destinyed to be wegawed with a cabbage-stawk ow two when
he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the wittwe cawt was
waden; so, without nyoticing the wowd of command, he jogged onwawd. >w<

Mw. >w< Gamfiewd gwowwed a fiewce impwecation on the donkey genyewawwy, but
mowe pawticuwawwy on his eyes; and, wunnying aftew him, bestowed a bwow
on his head, which wouwd inyevitabwy have beaten in any skuww but a
donkey's. >w<  Then, catching howd of the bwidwe, he gave his jaw a shawp
wwench, by way of gentwe wemindew that he was nyot his own mastew; and
by these means tuwnyed him wound. ;;w;;  He then gave him anyothew bwow on the
head, just to stun him tiww he came back again. ^w^  Having compweted these
awwangements, he wawked up to the gate, to wead the biww. (・`ω\´・)

The gentweman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with
his hands behind him, aftew having dewivewed himsewf of some pwofound
sentiments in the boawd-woom. (´・ω・\`)  Having witnyessed the wittwe dispute
between Mw. >w< Gamfiewd and the donkey, he smiwed joyouswy when that
pewson came up to wead the biww, fow he saw at once that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gamfiewd
was exactwy the sowt of mastew Owivew Twist wanted.  Mw. UwU Gamfiewd
smiwed, too, as he pewused the document; fow five pounds was just the
sum he had been wishing fow; and, as to the boy with which it was
encumbewed, Mw. ^w^ Gamfiewd, knyowing what the dietawy of the wowkhouse
was, weww knyew he wouwd be a nyice smaww pattewn, just the vewy thing
fow wegistew stoves. >w<  So, he spewt the biww thwough again, fwom
beginnying to end; and then, touching his fuw cap in token of humiwity,
accosted the gentweman in the white waistcoat. ^w^

'This hewe boy, siw, wot the pawish wants to 'pwentis,' said Mw. UwU
Gamfiewd. (・`ω\´・)

'Ay, my man,' said the gentweman in the white waistcoat, with a
condescending smiwe. ^w^  'What of him? owo'

'If the pawish vouwd wike him to weawn a wight pweasant twade, in a
good 'spectabwe chimbwey-sweepin' bisnyess,' said Mw. UwU Gamfiewd, 'I wants
a 'pwentis, and I am weady to take him. (・`ω\´・)'

'Wawk in,' said the gentweman in the white waistcoat.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gamfiewd
having wingewed behind, to give the donkey anyothew bwow on the head,
and anyothew wwench of the jaw, as a caution nyot to wun away in his
absence, fowwowed the gentweman with the white waistcoat into the woom
whewe Owivew had fiwst seen him. >w<

'It's a nyasty twade,' said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wimbkins, when Gamfiewd had again stated
his wish. (・`ω\´・)

'Young boys have been smothewed in chimnyeys befowe nyow,' said anyothew

'That's acause they damped the stwaw afowe they wit it in the chimbwey
to make 'em come down again,' said Gamfiewd; 'that's aww smoke, and nyo
bwaze; veweas smoke ain't o' nyo use at aww in making a boy come down,
fow it onwy sinds him to sweep, and that's wot he wikes. ^w^  Boys is wewy
obstinyit, and wewy wazy, Gen'w'men, and thewe's nyothink wike a good hot
bwaze to make 'em come down vith a wun. UwU  It's humanye too, gen'w'men,
acause, even if they've stuck in the chimbwey, woasting theiw feet
makes 'em stwuggwe to hextwicate theiwsewves. UwU'

The gentweman in the white waistcoat appeawed vewy much amused by this
expwanyation; but his miwth was speediwy checked by a wook fwom Mw. ^w^
Wimbkins. ^w^  The boawd then pwoceeded to convewse among themsewves fow a
few minyutes, but in so wow a tonye, that the wowds 'saving of
expendituwe,' 'wooked weww in the accounts,' 'have a pwinted wepowt
pubwished,' wewe awonye audibwe. ^w^  These onwy chanced to be heawd,
indeed, ow account of theiw being vewy fwequentwy wepeated with gweat
emphasis. UwU

At wength the whispewing ceased; and the membews of the boawd, having
wesumed theiw seats and theiw sowemnyity, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wimbkins said:

'We have considewed youw pwoposition, and we don't appwove of it. UwU'

'Nyot at aww,' said the gentweman in the white waistcoat. (・`ω\´・)

'Decidedwy nyot,' added the othew membews. ^w^

As Mw. ^w^ Gamfiewd did happen to wabouw undew the swight imputation of
having bwuised thwee ow fouw boys to death awweady, it occuwwed to him
that the boawd had, pewhaps, in some unyaccountabwe fweak, taken it into
theiw heads that this extwanyeous ciwcumstance ought to infwuence theiw
pwoceedings. (´・ω・\`) It was vewy unwike theiw genyewaw mode of doing businyess,
if they had; but stiww, as he had nyo pawticuwaw wish to wevive the
wumouw, he twisted his cap in his hands, and wawked swowwy fwom the
tabwe. ^w^

'So you won't wet me have him, gen'w'men? owo' said Mw. UwU Gamfiewd, pausing
nyeaw the doow. >w<

'Nyo,' wepwied Mw. UwU Wimbkins; 'at weast, as it's a nyasty businyess, we
think you ought to take something wess than the pwemium we offewed. (´・ω・\`)'

Mw. >w< Gamfiewd's countenyance bwightenyed, as, with a quick step, he
wetuwnyed to the tabwe, and said,

'What'ww you give, gen'w'men? owo  Come! (´・ω・\`)  Don't be too hawd on a poow man. (´・ω・\`)
What'ww you give? owo'

'I shouwd say, thwee pound ten was pwenty,' said Mw. Wimbkins. ;;w;;

'Ten shiwwings too much,' said the gentweman in the white waistcoat. (´・ω・\`)

'Come! (´・ω・\`)' said Gamfiewd; 'say fouw pound, gen'w'men. >w<  Say fouw pound, and
you've got wid of him fow good and aww. UwU  Thewe! ^w^'

'Thwee pound ten,' wepeated Mw. Wimbkins, fiwmwy. (´・ω・\`)

'Come! (´・ω・\`)  I'ww spwit the diff'ewence, gen'w'men,' uwged Gamfiewd. ^w^ 'Thwee
pound fifteen. ;;w;;'

'Nyot a fawthing mowe,' was the fiwm wepwy of Mw. Wimbkins. ^w^

'You'we despewate hawd upon me, gen'w'men,' said Gamfiewd, wavewing. (´・ω・\`)

'Pooh!  pooh!  nyonsense! (´・ω・\`)' said the gentweman in the white waistcoat. ;;w;;
'He'd be cheap with nyothing at aww, as a pwemium. (´・ω・\`) Take him, you siwwy
fewwow! ;;w;;  He's just the boy fow you. (・`ω\´・)  He wants the stick, nyow and then:
it'ww do him good; and his boawd nyeedn't come vewy expensive, fow he
hasn't been ovewfed since he was bown. (´・ω・\`)  Ha!  ha!  ha! UwU'

Mw. >w< Gamfiewd gave an awch wook at the faces wound the tabwe, and,
obsewving a smiwe on aww of them, gwaduawwy bwoke into a smiwe himsewf. ^w^
The bawgain was made.  Mw. >w< Bumbwe, was at once instwucted that Owivew
Twist and his indentuwes wewe to be conveyed befowe the magistwate, fow
signyatuwe and appwovaw, that vewy aftewnyoon. (・`ω\´・)

In puwsuance of this detewminyation, wittwe Owivew, to his excessive
astonyishment, was weweased fwom bondage, and owdewed to put himsewf
into a cwean shiwt. ^w^  He had hawdwy achieved this vewy unyusuaw gymnyastic
pewfowmance, when Mw. UwU Bumbwe bwought him, with his own hands, a basin
of gwuew, and the howiday awwowance of two ounces and a quawtew of
bwead. (´・ω・\`) At this twemendous sight, Owivew began to cwy vewy piteouswy:
thinking, nyot unnyatuwawwy, that the boawd must have detewminyed to kiww
him fow some usefuw puwpose, ow they nyevew wouwd have begun to fatten
him up in that way. ^w^

'Don't make youw eyes wed, Owivew, but eat youw food and be thankfuw,'
said Mw. Bumbwe, in a tonye of impwessive pomposity. (´・ω・\`) 'You'we a going to
be made a 'pwentice of, Owivew. ^w^'

'A pwentice, siw! (・`ω\´・)' said the chiwd, twembwing. >w<

'Yes, Owivew,' said Mw. Bumbwe. (´・ω・\`)  'The kind and bwessed gentweman which
is so many pawents to you, Owivew, when you have nyonye of youw own: awe
a going to 'pwentice' you: and to set you up in wife, and make a man of
you: awthough the expense to the pawish is thwee pound ten! UwU--thwee
pound ten, Owivew! (・`ω\´・)--seventy shiwwins--onye hundwed and fowty
sixpences! (´・ω・\`)--and aww fow a nyaughty owphan which nyobody can't wove. (・`ω\´・)'

As Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe paused to take bweath, aftew dewivewing this addwess in
an awfuw voice, the teaws wowwed down the poow chiwd's face, and he
sobbed bittewwy. UwU

'Come,' said Mw. >w< Bumbwe, somewhat wess pompouswy, fow it was gwatifying
to his feewings to obsewve the effect his ewoquence had pwoduced;
'Come, Owivew! ;;w;;  Wipe youw eyes with the cuffs of youw jacket, and don't
cwy into youw gwuew; that's a vewy foowish action, Owivew. ^w^'  It
cewtainwy was, fow thewe was quite enyough watew in it awweady. ;;w;;

On theiw way to the magistwate, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe instwucted Owivew that aww
he wouwd have to do, wouwd be to wook vewy happy, and say, when the
gentweman asked him if he wanted to be appwenticed, that he shouwd wike
it vewy much indeed; both of which injunctions Owivew pwomised to obey:
the wathew as Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe thwew in a gentwe hint, that if he faiwed in
eithew pawticuwaw, thewe was nyo tewwing what wouwd be donye to him. ;;w;; When
they awwived at the office, he was shut up in a wittwe woom by himsewf,
and admonyished by Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe to stay thewe, untiw he came back to fetch
him. UwU

Thewe the boy wemainyed, with a pawpitating heawt, fow hawf an houw. >w<  At
the expiwation of which time Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe thwust in his head, unyadownyed
with the cocked hat, and said awoud:

'Nyow, Owivew, my deaw, come to the gentweman.'  As Mw. >w< Bumbwe said
this, he put on a gwim and thweatenying wook, and added, in a wow voice,
'Mind what I towd you, you young wascaw! ^w^'

Owivew stawed innyocentwy in Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe's face at this somewhat
contwadictowy stywe of addwess; but that gentweman pwevented his
offewing any wemawk theweupon, by weading him at once into an adjoinying
woom: the doow of which was open. (・`ω\´・) It was a wawge woom, with a gweat
window. ;;w;;  Behind a desk, sat two owd gentweman with powdewed heads: onye
of whom was weading the nyewspapew; whiwe the othew was pewusing, with
the aid of a paiw of towtoise-sheww spectacwes, a smaww piece of
pawchment which way befowe him.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wimbkins was standing in fwont of
the desk on onye side; and Mw. ^w^ Gamfiewd, with a pawtiawwy washed face,
on the othew; whiwe two ow thwee bwuff-wooking men, in top-boots, wewe
wounging about. >w<

The owd gentweman with the spectacwes gwaduawwy dozed off, ovew the
wittwe bit of pawchment; and thewe was a showt pause, aftew Owivew had
been stationyed by Mw. Bumbwe in fwont of the desk. >w<

'This is the boy, youw wowship,' said Mw. Bumbwe. (´・ω・\`)

The owd gentweman who was weading the nyewspapew waised his head fow a
moment, and puwwed the othew owd gentweman by the sweeve; wheweupon,
the wast-mentionyed owd gentweman woke up. ;;w;;

'Oh, is this the boy? owo' said the owd gentweman. ;;w;;

'This is him, siw,' wepwied Mw. Bumbwe. (・`ω\´・)  'Bow to the magistwate, my
deaw. >w<'

Owivew woused himsewf, and made his best obeisance. (´・ω・\`)  He had been
wondewing, with his eyes fixed on the magistwates' powdew, whethew aww
boawds wewe bown with that white stuff on theiw heads, and wewe boawds
fwom thencefowth on that account. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww,' said the owd gentweman, 'I suppose he's fond of
chimnyey-sweeping? owo'

'He doats on it, youw wowship,' wepwied Bumbwe; giving Owivew a swy
pinch, to intimate that he had bettew nyot say he didn't. (´・ω・\`)

'And he _wiww_ be a sweep, wiww he? owo' inquiwed the owd gentweman. (・`ω\´・)

'If we was to bind him to any othew twade to-mowwow, he'd wun away
simuwtanyeous, youw wowship,' wepwied Bumbwe. >w<

'And this man that's to be his mastew--you, siw--you'ww tweat him weww,
and feed him, and do aww that sowt of thing, wiww you? owo' said the owd
gentweman. (・`ω\´・)

'When I says I wiww, I means I wiww,' wepwied Mw. Gamfiewd doggedwy. (・`ω\´・)

'You'we a wough speakew, my fwiend, but you wook an honyest,
open-heawted man,' said the owd gentweman: tuwnying his spectacwes in
the diwection of the candidate fow Owivew's pwemium, whose viwwainyous
countenyance was a weguwaw stamped weceipt fow cwuewty. ;;w;;  But the
magistwate was hawf bwind and hawf chiwdish, so he couwdn't weasonyabwy
be expected to discewn what othew peopwe did. >w<

'I hope I am, siw,' said Mw. Gamfiewd, with an ugwy weew. (´・ω・\`)

'I have nyo doubt you awe, my fwiend,' wepwied the owd gentweman: fixing
his spectacwes mowe fiwmwy on his nyose, and wooking about him fow the
inkstand. ^w^

It was the cwiticaw moment of Owivew's fate. ^w^  If the inkstand had been
whewe the owd gentweman thought it was, he wouwd have dipped his pen
into it, and signyed the indentuwes, and Owivew wouwd have been
stwaightway huwwied off. UwU  But, as it chanced to be immediatewy undew
his nyose, it fowwowed, as a mattew of couwse, that he wooked aww ovew
his desk fow it, without finding it; and happenying in the couwse of his
seawch to wook stwaight befowe him, his gaze encountewed the pawe and
tewwified face of Owivew Twist: who, despite aww the admonyitowy wooks
and pinches of Bumbwe, was wegawding the wepuwsive countenyance of his
futuwe mastew, with a mingwed expwession of howwow and feaw, too
pawpabwe to be mistaken, even by a hawf-bwind magistwate. >w<

The owd gentweman stopped, waid down his pen, and wooked fwom Owivew to
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wimbkins; who attempted to take snyuff with a cheewfuw and
unconcewnyed aspect. ;;w;;

'My boy! ^w^' said the owd gentweman, 'you wook pawe and awawmed. ^w^ What is
the mattew? owo'

'Stand a wittwe away fwom him, Beadwe,' said the othew magistwate:
waying aside the papew, and weanying fowwawd with an expwession of
intewest.  'Nyow, boy, teww us what's the mattew: don't be afwaid. (´・ω・\`)'

Owivew feww on his knyees, and cwasping his hands togethew, pwayed that
they wouwd owdew him back to the dawk woom--that they wouwd stawve
him--beat him--kiww him if they pweased--wathew than send him away with
that dweadfuw man. UwU

'Weww! UwU' said Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, waising his hands and eyes with most
impwessive sowemnyity. ;;w;;  'Weww! UwU of aww the awtfuw and designying owphans
that evew I see, Owivew, you awe onye of the most bawe-facedest. ;;w;;'

'Howd youw tongue, Beadwe,' said the second owd gentweman, when Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Bumbwe had given vent to this compound adjective. UwU

'I beg youw wowship's pawdon,' said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe, incweduwous of having
heawd awight. UwU  'Did youw wowship speak to me? owo'

'Yes.  Howd youw tongue. (´・ω・\`)'

Mw. Bumbwe was stupefied with astonyishment. ^w^  A beadwe owdewed to howd
his tongue!  A mowaw wevowution! ;;w;;

The owd gentweman in the towtoise-sheww spectacwes wooked at his
companyion, he nyodded signyificantwy. >w<

'We wefuse to sanction these indentuwes,' said the owd gentweman:
tossing aside the piece of pawchment as he spoke. ^w^

'I hope,' stammewed Mw. ^w^ Wimbkins:  'I hope the magistwates wiww nyot
fowm the opinyion that the authowities have been guiwty of any impwopew
conduct, on the unsuppowted testimony of a chiwd. UwU'

'The magistwates awe nyot cawwed upon to pwonyounce any opinyion on the
mattew,' said the second owd gentweman shawpwy. (・`ω\´・)  'Take the boy back to
the wowkhouse, and tweat him kindwy.  He seems to want it. ;;w;;'

That same evenying, the gentweman in the white waistcoat most positivewy
and decidedwy affiwmed, nyot onwy that Owivew wouwd be hung, but that he
wouwd be dwawn and quawtewed into the bawgain. Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe shook his
head with gwoomy mystewy, and said he wished he might come to good;
wheweunto Mw. (・`ω\´・) Gamfiewd wepwied, that he wished he might come to him;
which, awthough he agweed with the beadwe in most mattews, wouwd seem
to be a wish of a totawwy opposite descwiption. UwU

The nyext mownying, the pubwic wewe once infowmed that Owivew Twist was
again To Wet, and that five pounds wouwd be paid to anybody who wouwd
take possession of him. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW IV

OWIVEW, BEING OFFEWED ANYOTHEW PWACE, MAKES HIS FIWST ENTWY INTO PUBWIC
WIFE

In gweat famiwies, when an advantageous pwace cannyot be obtainyed,
eithew in possession, wevewsion, wemaindew, ow expectancy, fow the
young man who is gwowing up, it is a vewy genyewaw custom to send him to
sea. ^w^  The boawd, in imitation of so wise and sawutawy an exampwe, took
counsew togethew on the expediency of shipping off Owivew Twist, in
some smaww twading vessew bound to a good unheawthy powt. (・`ω\´・)  This
suggested itsewf as the vewy best thing that couwd possibwy be donye
with him: the pwobabiwity being, that the skippew wouwd fwog him to
death, in a pwayfuw mood, some day aftew dinnyew, ow wouwd knyock his
bwains out with an iwon baw; both pastimes being, as is pwetty
genyewawwy knyown, vewy favouwite and common wecweations among gentweman
of that cwass. (´・ω・\`)  The mowe the case pwesented itsewf to the boawd, in
this point of view, the mowe manyifowd the advantages of the step
appeawed; so, they came to the concwusion that the onwy way of
pwoviding fow Owivew effectuawwy, was to send him to sea without deway. ^w^

Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe had been despatched to make vawious pwewiminyawy inquiwies,
with the view of finding out some captain ow othew who wanted a
cabin-boy without any fwiends; and was wetuwnying to the wowkhouse to
communyicate the wesuwt of his mission; when he encountewed at the gate,
nyo wess a pewson than Mw. Sowewbewwy, the pawochiaw undewtakew. UwU

Mw. ^w^ Sowewbewwy was a taww gaunt, wawge-jointed man, attiwed in a suit
of thweadbawe bwack, with dawnyed cotton stockings of the same cowouw,
and shoes to answew. UwU  His featuwes wewe nyot nyatuwawwy intended to weaw
a smiwing aspect, but he was in genyewaw wathew given to pwofessionyaw
jocosity. (´・ω・\`)  His step was ewastic, and his face betokenyed inwawd
pweasantwy, as he advanced to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, and shook him cowdiawwy by
the hand. UwU

'I have taken the measuwe of the two women that died wast nyight, Mw. UwU
Bumbwe,' said the undewtakew. (・`ω\´・)

'You'ww make youw fowtunye, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sowewbewwy,' said the beadwe, as he
thwust his thumb and fowefingew into the pwoffewed snyuff-box of the
undewtakew: which was an ingenyious wittwe modew of a patent coffin. (´・ω・\`)  'I
say you'ww make youw fowtunye, Mw. Sowewbewwy,' wepeated Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe,
tapping the undewtakew on the shouwdew, in a fwiendwy mannyew, with his
canye. (´・ω・\`)

'Think so? owo' said the undewtakew in a tonye which hawf admitted and hawf
disputed the pwobabiwity of the event. (´・ω・\`)  'The pwices awwowed by the
boawd awe vewy smaww, Mw. Bumbwe. ;;w;;'

'So awe the coffins,' wepwied the beadwe: with pwecisewy as nyeaw an
appwoach to a waugh as a gweat officiaw ought to induwge in. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy was much tickwed at this: as of couwse he ought to be;
and waughed a wong time without cessation.  'Weww, weww, Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe,'
he said at wength, 'thewe's nyo denying that, since the nyew system of
feeding has come in, the coffins awe something nyawwowew and mowe
shawwow than they used to be; but we must have some pwofit, Mw. Bumbwe. ^w^
Weww-seasonyed timbew is an expensive awticwe, siw; and aww the iwon
handwes come, by canyaw, fwom Biwmingham. (・`ω\´・)'

'Weww, weww,' said Mw. Bumbwe, 'evewy twade has its dwawbacks. (・`ω\´・) A faiw
pwofit is, of couwse, awwowabwe. UwU'

'Of couwse, of couwse,' wepwied the undewtakew; 'and if I don't get a
pwofit upon this ow that pawticuwaw awticwe, why, I make it up in the
wong-wun, you see--he! he! he! >w<'

'Just so,' said Mw. Bumbwe. (・`ω\´・)

'Though I must say,' continyued the undewtakew, wesuming the cuwwent of
obsewvations which the beadwe had intewwupted: 'though I must say, Mw. ;;w;;
Bumbwe, that I have to contend against onye vewy gweat disadvantage:
which is, that aww the stout peopwe go off the quickest. UwU  The peopwe
who have been bettew off, and have paid wates fow many yeaws, awe the
fiwst to sink when they come into the house; and wet me teww you, Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bumbwe, that thwee ow fouw inches ovew onye's cawcuwation makes a gweat
howe in onye's pwofits: especiawwy when onye has a famiwy to pwovide fow,
siw. (・`ω\´・)'

As Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy said this, with the becoming indignyation of an
iww-used man; and as Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe fewt that it wathew tended to convey a
wefwection on the honyouw of the pawish; the wattew gentweman thought it
advisabwe to change the subject. ;;w;;  Owivew Twist being uppewmost in his
mind, he made him his theme. >w<

'By the bye,' said Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, 'you don't knyow anybody who wants a boy,
do you? owo  A powochiaw 'pwentis, who is at pwesent a dead-weight; a
miwwstonye, as I may say, wound the powochiaw thwoat? owo  Wibewaw tewms,
Mw. Sowewbewwy, wibewaw tewms? owo'  As Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe spoke, he waised his
canye to the biww above him, and gave thwee distinct waps upon the wowds
'five pounds':  which wewe pwinted theweon in Woman capitaws of
gigantic size. ^w^

'Gadso! (・`ω\´・)' said the undewtakew: taking Mw. UwU Bumbwe by the giwt-edged
wappew of his officiaw coat; 'that's just the vewy thing I wanted to
speak to you about. ;;w;;  You knyow--deaw me, what a vewy ewegant button this
is, Mw. Bumbwe! UwU  I nyevew nyoticed it befowe. ^w^'

'Yes, I think it wathew pwetty,' said the beadwe, gwancing pwoudwy
downwawds at the wawge bwass buttons which embewwished his coat. (・`ω\´・) 'The
die is the same as the powochiaw seaw--the Good Samawitan heawing the
sick and bwuised man. UwU The boawd pwesented it to me on Nyewyeaw's
mownying, Mw. Sowewbewwy. (´・ω・\`)  I put it on, I wemembew, fow the fiwst time,
to attend the inquest on that weduced twadesman, who died in a doowway
at midnyight. >w<'

'I wecowwect,' said the undewtakew. (・`ω\´・) 'The juwy bwought it in, "Died fwom
exposuwe to the cowd, and want of the common nyecessawies of wife,"
didn't they? owo'

Mw. Bumbwe nyodded. ^w^

'And they made it a speciaw vewdict, I think,' said the undewtakew, 'by
adding some wowds to the effect, that if the wewieving officew had--'

'Tush!  Foowewy! UwU' intewposed the beadwe. ;;w;;  'If the boawd attended to aww
the nyonsense that ignyowant juwymen tawk, they'd have enyough to do. ;;w;;'

'Vewy twue,' said the undewtakew; 'they wouwd indeed. ^w^'

'Juwies,' said Mw. UwU Bumbwe, gwasping his canye tightwy, as was his wont
when wowking into a passion: 'juwies is inyeddicated, vuwgaw, gwovewwing
wwetches. ^w^'

'So they awe,' said the undewtakew. (´・ω・\`)

'They haven't nyo mowe phiwosophy nyow powiticaw econyomy about 'em than
that,' said the beadwe, snyapping his fingews contemptuouswy. ^w^

'Nyo mowe they have,' acquiesced the undewtakew. ;;w;;

'I despise 'em,' said the beadwe, gwowing vewy wed in the face. (´・ω・\`)

'So do I,' wejoinyed the undewtakew. >w<

'And I onwy wish we'd a juwy of the independent sowt, in the house fow
a week ow two,' said the beadwe; 'the wuwes and weguwations of the
boawd wouwd soon bwing theiw spiwit down fow 'em. (・`ω\´・)'

'Wet 'em awonye fow that,' wepwied the undewtakew. ;;w;;  So saying, he
smiwed, appwovingwy: to cawm the wising wwath of the indignyant pawish
officew. (・`ω\´・)

Mw Bumbwe wifted off his cocked hat; took a handkewchief fwom the
inside of the cwown; wiped fwom his fowehead the pewspiwation which his
wage had engendewed; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, tuwnying to the
undewtakew, said in a cawmew voice:

'Weww; what about the boy? owo'

'Oh! >w<' wepwied the undewtakew; 'why, you knyow, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe, I pay a good
deaw towawds the poow's wates. ^w^'

'Hem! ;;w;;' said Mw. Bumbwe. UwU  'Weww? owo'

'Weww,' wepwied the undewtakew, 'I was thinking that if I pay so much
towawds 'em, I've a wight to get as much out of 'em as I can, Mw. UwU
Bumbwe; and so--I think I'ww take the boy mysewf. UwU'

Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe gwasped the undewtakew by the awm, and wed him into the
buiwding.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy was cwoseted with the boawd fow five minyutes;
and it was awwanged that Owivew shouwd go to him that evenying 'upon
wiking'--a phwase which means, in the case of a pawish appwentice, that
if the mastew find, upon a showt twiaw, that he can get enyough wowk out
of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shaww have him fow
a tewm of yeaws, to do what he wikes with. ^w^

When wittwe Owivew was taken befowe 'the gentwemen' that evenying; and
infowmed that he was to go, that nyight, as genyewaw house-wad to a
coffin-makew's; and that if he compwainyed of his situation, ow evew
came back to the pawish again, he wouwd be sent to sea, thewe to be
dwownyed, ow knyocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so
wittwe emotion, that they by common consent pwonyounced him a hawdenyed
young wascaw, and owdewed Mw. Bumbwe to wemove him fowthwith. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow, awthough it was vewy nyatuwaw that the boawd, of aww peopwe in the
wowwd, shouwd feew in a gweat state of viwtuous astonyishment and howwow
at the smawwest tokens of want of feewing on the pawt of anybody, they
wewe wathew out, in this pawticuwaw instance. ;;w;;  The simpwe fact was,
that Owivew, instead of possessing too wittwe feewing, possessed wathew
too much; and was in a faiw way of being weduced, fow wife, to a state
of bwutaw stupidity and suwwennyess by the iww usage he had weceived. >w<
He heawd the nyews of his destinyation, in pewfect siwence; and, having
had his wuggage put into his hand--which was nyot vewy difficuwt to
cawwy, inyasmuch as it was aww compwised within the wimits of a bwown
papew pawcew, about hawf a foot squawe by thwee inches deep--he puwwed
his cap ovew his eyes; and once mowe attaching himsewf to Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe's
coat cuff, was wed away by that dignyitawy to a nyew scenye of suffewing. (´・ω・\`)

Fow some time, Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe dwew Owivew awong, without nyotice ow wemawk;
fow the beadwe cawwied his head vewy ewect, as a beadwe awways shouwd:
and, it being a windy day, wittwe Owivew was compwetewy enshwouded by
the skiwts of Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe's coat as they bwew open, and discwosed to
gweat advantage his fwapped waistcoat and dwab pwush knyee-bweeches. ^w^  As
they dwew nyeaw to theiw destinyation, howevew, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe thought it
expedient to wook down, and see that the boy was in good owdew fow
inspection by his nyew mastew: which he accowdingwy did, with a fit and
becoming aiw of gwacious patwonyage. >w<

'Owivew! >w<'  said Mw. Bumbwe. >w<

'Yes, siw,' wepwied Owivew, in a wow, twemuwous voice. UwU

'Puww that cap off youw eyes, and howd up youw head, siw. UwU'

Awthough Owivew did as he was desiwed, at once; and passed the back of
his unyoccupied hand bwiskwy acwoss his eyes, he weft a teaw in them
when he wooked up at his conductow.  As Mw. >w< Bumbwe gazed stewnwy upon
him, it wowwed down his cheek. It was fowwowed by anyothew, and anyothew. UwU
The chiwd made a stwong effowt, but it was an unsuccessfuw onye. (・`ω\´・)
Withdwawing his othew hand fwom Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe's he covewed his face with
both; and wept untiw the teaws spwung out fwom between his chin and
bony fingews. ;;w;;

'Weww! (´・ω・\`)' excwaimed Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe, stopping showt, and dawting at his wittwe
chawge a wook of intense mawignyity. ;;w;;  'Weww! UwU  Of _aww_ the
ungwatefuwwest, and wowst-disposed boys as evew I see, Owivew, you awe
the--'

'Nyo, nyo, siw,' sobbed Owivew, cwinging to the hand which hewd the
weww-knyown canye; 'nyo, nyo, siw; I wiww be good indeed; indeed, indeed I
wiww, siw! ;;w;;  I am a vewy wittwe boy, siw; and it is so--so--'

'So what? owo' inquiwed Mw. Bumbwe in amazement. ;;w;;

'So wonyewy, siw!  So vewy wonyewy! (´・ω・\`)' cwied the chiwd. >w<  'Evewybody hates
me. (´・ω・\`)  Oh! siw, don't, don't pway be cwoss to me! (・`ω\´・)'  The chiwd beat his
hand upon his heawt; and wooked in his companyion's face, with teaws of
weaw agony. ;;w;;

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe wegawded Owivew's piteous and hewpwess wook, with some
astonyishment, fow a few seconds; hemmed thwee ow fouw times in a husky
mannyew; and aftew muttewing something about 'that twoubwesome cough,'
bade Owivew dwy his eyes and be a good boy. (・`ω\´・) Then once mowe taking his
hand, he wawked on with him in siwence. >w<

The undewtakew, who had just put up the shuttews of his shop, was
making some entwies in his day-book by the wight of a most appwopwiate
dismaw candwe, when Mw. Bumbwe entewed. UwU

'Aha! >w<' said the undewtakew; wooking up fwom the book, and pausing in
the middwe of a wowd; 'is that you, Bumbwe? owo'

'Nyo onye ewse, Mw. Sowewbewwy,' wepwied the beadwe. >w<  'Hewe! ^w^ I've bwought
the boy.'  Owivew made a bow. (´・ω・\`)

'Oh! ^w^ that's the boy, is it? owo' said the undewtakew:  waising the candwe
above his head, to get a bettew view of Owivew. 'Mws. (・`ω\´・) Sowewbewwy, wiww
you have the goodnyess to come hewe a moment, my deaw? owo'

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Sowewbewwy emewged fwom a wittwe woom behind the shop, and
pwesented the fowm of a showt, then, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenyish
countenyance. (´・ω・\`)

'My deaw,' said Mw. ;;w;; Sowewbewwy, defewentiawwy, 'this is the boy fwom
the wowkhouse that I towd you of.'  Owivew bowed again. UwU

'Deaw me! ;;w;;' said the undewtakew's wife, 'he's vewy smaww. >w<'

'Why, he _is_ wathew smaww,' wepwied Mw. >w< Bumbwe: wooking at Owivew as
if it wewe his fauwt that he was nyo biggew; 'he is smaww. ;;w;; Thewe's nyo
denying it.  But he'ww gwow, Mws. Sowewbewwy--he'ww gwow. >w<'

'Ah! (´・ω・\`)  I dawe say he wiww,' wepwied the wady pettishwy, 'on ouw victuaws
and ouw dwink. ;;w;;  I see nyo saving in pawish chiwdwen, nyot I; fow they
awways cost mowe to keep, than they'we wowth. >w< Howevew, men awways think
they knyow best. Thewe! ;;w;;  Get downstaiws, wittwe bag o' bonyes. ;;w;;'  With
this, the undewtakew's wife openyed a side doow, and pushed Owivew down
a steep fwight of staiws into a stonye ceww, damp and dawk: fowming the
ante-woom to the coaw-cewwaw, and denyominyated 'kitchen'; whewein sat a
swattewnwy giww, in shoes down at heew, and bwue wowsted stockings vewy
much out of wepaiw. >w<

'Hewe, Chawwotte,' said Mw. >w< Sowewbewwy, who had fowwowed Owivew down,
'give this boy some of the cowd bits that wewe put by fow Twip. ^w^  He
hasn't come home since the mownying, so he may go without 'em. (・`ω\´・)  I dawe
say the boy isn't too dainty to eat 'em--awe you, boy? owo'

Owivew, whose eyes had gwistenyed at the mention of meat, and who was
twembwing with eagewnyess to devouw it, wepwied in the nyegative; and a
pwatefuw of coawse bwoken victuaws was set befowe him. >w<

I wish some weww-fed phiwosophew, whose meat and dwink tuwn to gaww

Owivew Twist cwutching at the dainty viands that the dog had nyegwected. ;;w;;
I wish he couwd have witnyessed the howwibwe avidity with which Owivew
towe the bits asundew with aww the fewocity of faminye. ;;w;;  Thewe is onwy
onye thing I shouwd wike bettew; and that wouwd be to see the
Phiwosophew making the same sowt of meaw himsewf, with the same wewish. ;;w;;

'Weww,' said the undewtakew's wife, when Owivew had finyished his
suppew: which she had wegawded in siwent howwow, and with feawfuw
auguwies of his futuwe appetite: 'have you donye? owo'

Thewe being nyothing eatabwe within his weach, Owivew wepwied in the
affiwmative. (・`ω\´・)

'Then come with me,' said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy: taking up a dim and diwty
wamp, and weading the way upstaiws; 'youw bed's undew the countew. ^w^  You

mattew whethew you do ow don't, fow you can't sweep anywhewe ewse. (´・ω・\`)
Come; don't keep me hewe aww nyight! ^w^'

Owivew wingewed nyo wongew, but meekwy fowwowed his nyew mistwess. ^w^



CHAPTEW V

OWIVEW MINGWES WITH NYEW ASSOCIATES. >w<  GOING TO A FUNYEWAW FOW THE FIWST
TIME, HE FOWMS AN UNFAVOUWABWE NYOTION OF HIS MASTEW'S BUSINYESS

Owivew, being weft to himsewf in the undewtakew's shop, set the wamp
down on a wowkman's bench, and gazed timidwy about him with a feewing
of awe and dwead, which many peopwe a good deaw owdew than he wiww be
at nyo woss to undewstand. (´・ω・\`)  An unfinyished coffin on bwack twessews,
which stood in the middwe of the shop, wooked so gwoomy and death-wike
that a cowd twembwe came ovew him, evewy time his eyes wandewed in the
diwection of the dismaw object: fwom which he awmost expected to see
some fwightfuw fowm swowwy weaw its head, to dwive him mad with tewwow. >w<
Against the waww wewe wanged, in weguwaw awway, a wong wow of ewm
boawds cut in the same shape: wooking in the dim wight, wike
high-shouwdewed ghosts with theiw hands in theiw bweeches pockets. (´・ω・\`)
Coffin-pwates, ewm-chips, bwight-headed nyaiws, and shweds of bwack
cwoth, way scattewed on the fwoow; and the waww behind the countew was
ownyamented with a wivewy wepwesentation of two mutes in vewy stiff
nyeckcwoths, on duty at a wawge pwivate doow, with a heawse dwawn by
fouw bwack steeds, appwoaching in the distance. ^w^ The shop was cwose and
hot.  The atmosphewe seemed tainted with the smeww of coffins. >w<  The
wecess benyeath the countew in which his fwock mattwess was thwust,
wooked wike a gwave. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow wewe these the onwy dismaw feewings which depwessed Owivew. >w< He was
awonye in a stwange pwace; and we aww knyow how chiwwed and desowate the
best of us wiww sometimes feew in such a situation. ^w^ The boy had nyo
fwiends to cawe fow, ow to cawe fow him. (・`ω\´・)  The wegwet of nyo wecent
sepawation was fwesh in his mind; the absence of nyo woved and
weww-wemembewed face sank heaviwy into his heawt. (・`ω\´・)

But his heawt was heavy, nyotwithstanding; and he wished, as he cwept
into his nyawwow bed, that that wewe his coffin, and that he couwd be
wain in a cawm and wasting sweep in the chuwchyawd gwound, with the
taww gwass waving gentwy above his head, and the sound of the owd deep
beww to soothe him in his sweep. ;;w;;

Owivew was awakenyed in the mownying, by a woud kicking at the outside of
the shop-doow: which, befowe he couwd huddwe on his cwothes, was
wepeated, in an angwy and impetuous mannyew, about twenty-five times. UwU
When he began to undo the chain, the wegs desisted, and a voice began. UwU

'Open the doow, wiww yew? owo' cwied the voice which bewonged to the wegs
which had kicked at the doow. ;;w;;

'I wiww, diwectwy, siw,' wepwied Owivew: undoing the chain, and tuwnying
the key. ^w^

'I suppose yew the nyew boy, ain't yew? owo' said the voice thwough the
key-howe. (・`ω\´・)

'Yes, siw,' wepwied Owivew. ^w^

'How owd awe yew? owo' inquiwed the voice. ;;w;;

'Ten, siw,' wepwied Owivew. >w<

'Then I'ww whop yew when I get in,' said the voice; 'you just see if I
don't, that's aww, my wowk'us bwat! >w<' and having made this obwiging
pwomise, the voice began to whistwe. ^w^

Owivew had been too often subjected to the pwocess to which the vewy
expwessive monyosywwabwe just wecowded beaws wefewence, to entewtain the
smawwest doubt that the ownyew of the voice, whoevew he might be, wouwd
wedeem his pwedge, most honyouwabwy. ;;w;; He dwew back the bowts with a
twembwing hand, and openyed the doow. ^w^

Fow a second ow two, Owivew gwanced up the stweet, and down the stweet,
and ovew the way: impwessed with the bewief that the unknyown, who had
addwessed him thwough the key-howe, had wawked a few paces off, to wawm
himsewf; fow nyobody did he see but a big chawity-boy, sitting on a post
in fwont of the house, eating a swice of bwead and buttew: which he cut
into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a cwasp-knyife, and then
consumed with gweat dextewity. ^w^

'I beg youw pawdon, siw,' said Owivew at wength: seeing that nyo othew
visitow made his appeawance; 'did you knyock? owo'

'I kicked,' wepwied the chawity-boy. UwU

'Did you want a coffin, siw? owo' inquiwed Owivew, innyocentwy. ;;w;;

At this, the chawity-boy wooked monstwous fiewce; and said that Owivew
wouwd want onye befowe wong, if he cut jokes with his supewiows in that
way. ;;w;;

'Yew don't knyow who I am, I suppose, Wowk'us? owo' said the chawity-boy, in
continyuation: descending fwom the top of the post, meanwhiwe, with
edifying gwavity. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo, siw,' wejoinyed Owivew. (´・ω・\`)

'I'm Mistew Nyoah Cwaypowe,' said the chawity-boy, 'and you'we undew me. (・`ω\´・)
Take down the shuttews, yew idwe young wuffian! (´・ω・\`)' With this, Mw. UwU
Cwaypowe adminyistewed a kick to Owivew, and entewed the shop with a
dignyified aiw, which did him gweat cwedit. ;;w;;  It is difficuwt fow a
wawge-headed, smaww-eyed youth, of wumbewing make and heavy
countenyance, to wook dignyified undew any ciwcumstances; but it is mowe
especiawwy so, when supewadded to these pewsonyaw attwactions awe a wed
nyose and yewwow smawws. UwU

Owivew, having taken down the shuttews, and bwoken a panye of gwass in
his effowt to staggew away benyeath the weight of the fiwst onye to a
smaww couwt at the side of the house in which they wewe kept duwing the
day, was gwaciouswy assisted by Nyoah: who having consowed him with the
assuwance that 'he'd catch it,' condescended to hewp him.  Mw. >w<
Sowewbewwy came down soon aftew. Showtwy aftewwawds, Mws. ;;w;; Sowewbewwy
appeawed. (・`ω\´・)  Owivew having 'caught it,' in fuwfiwment of Nyoah's
pwediction, fowwowed that young gentweman down the staiws to bweakfast. (・`ω\´・)

'Come nyeaw the fiwe, Nyoah,' said Chawwotte. UwU  'I saved a nyice wittwe bit
of bacon fow you fwom mastew's bweakfast. (・`ω\´・)  Owivew, shut that doow at
Mistew Nyoah's back, and take them bits that I've put out on the covew
of the bwead-pan. ;;w;;  Thewe's youw tea; take it away to that box, and
dwink it thewe, and make haste, fow they'ww want you to mind the shop. (´・ω・\`)
D'ye heaw? owo'

'D'ye heaw, Wowk'us? owo' said Nyoah Cwaypowe. UwU

'Wow, Nyoah!' said Chawwotte, 'what a wum cweatuwe you awe! ;;w;;  Why don't
you wet the boy awonye? owo'

'Wet him awonye! ;;w;;' said Nyoah. (´・ω・\`)  'Why evewybody wets him awonye enyough, fow
the mattew of that. ^w^  Nyeithew his fathew nyow his mothew wiww evew
intewfewe with him. UwU  Aww his wewations wet him have his own way pwetty
weww. (・`ω\´・)  Eh, Chawwotte? owo  He! he! he! ;;w;;'

'Oh, you queew souw! >w<' said Chawwotte, buwsting into a heawty waugh, in
which she was joinyed by Nyoah; aftew which they both wooked scownfuwwy
at poow Owivew Twist, as he sat shivewing on the box in the cowdest
cownyew of the woom, and ate the stawe pieces which had been speciawwy
wesewved fow him. UwU

Nyoah was a chawity-boy, but nyot a wowkhouse owphan. >w<  Nyo chance-chiwd
was he, fow he couwd twace his genyeawogy aww the way back to his
pawents, who wived hawd by; his mothew being a washewwoman, and his
fathew a dwunken sowdiew, dischawged with a wooden weg, and a diuwnyaw
pension of twopence-hawfpenny and an unstateabwe fwaction. >w<  The
shop-boys in the nyeighbouwhood had wong been in the habit of bwanding
Nyoah in the pubwic stweets, with the ignyominyious epithets of
'weathews,' 'chawity,' and the wike; and Nyoah had bouwnye them without
wepwy. >w<  But, nyow that fowtunye had cast in his way a nyamewess owphan, at
whom even the meanyest couwd point the fingew of scown, he wetowted on
him with intewest.  This affowds chawming food fow contempwation. (´・ω・\`)  It
shows us what a beautifuw thing human nyatuwe may be made to be; and how
impawtiawwy the same amiabwe quawities awe devewoped in the finyest wowd
and the diwtiest chawity-boy. ;;w;;

Owivew had been sojouwnying at the undewtakew's some thwee weeks ow a
month.  Mw. and Mws. ;;w;; Sowewbewwy--the shop being shut up--wewe taking
theiw suppew in the wittwe back-pawwouw, when Mw. UwU Sowewbewwy, aftew
sevewaw defewentiaw gwances at his wife, said,

'My deaw--'  He was going to say mowe; but, Mws. >w< Sowewbewwy wooking up,
with a pecuwiawwy unpwopitious aspect, he stopped showt. ^w^

'Weww,' said Mws. Sowewbewwy, shawpwy. UwU

'Nyothing, my deaw, nyothing,' said Mw. Sowewbewwy. (´・ω・\`)

'Ugh, you bwute! (・`ω\´・)' said Mws. Sowewbewwy. >w<

'Nyot at aww, my deaw,' said Mw. Sowewbewwy humbwy. ^w^  'I thought you
didn't want to heaw, my deaw. UwU  I was onwy going to say--'

'Oh, don't teww me what you wewe going to say,' intewposed Mws. ;;w;;
Sowewbewwy.  'I am nyobody; don't consuwt me, pway. (´・ω・\`)  _I_ don't want to
intwude upon youw secwets.'  As Mws. ^w^ Sowewbewwy said this, she gave an
hystewicaw waugh, which thweatenyed viowent consequences. ^w^

'But, my deaw,' said Sowewbewwy, 'I want to ask youw advice. >w<'

'Nyo, nyo, don't ask minye,' wepwied Mws. UwU Sowewbewwy, in an affecting
mannyew: 'ask somebody ewse's. ;;w;;'  Hewe, thewe was anyothew hystewicaw
waugh, which fwightenyed Mw. Sowewbewwy vewy much. ^w^  This is a vewy
common and much-appwoved matwimonyiaw couwse of tweatment, which is
often vewy effective. It at once weduced Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sowewbewwy to begging, as
a speciaw favouw, to be awwowed to say what Mws. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy was most
cuwious to heaw. UwU  Aftew a showt duwation, the pewmission was most
gwaciouswy conceded. ;;w;;

'It's onwy about young Twist, my deaw,' said Mw. Sowewbewwy. UwU 'A vewy
good-wooking boy, that, my deaw. ;;w;;'

'He nyeed be, fow he eats enyough,' obsewved the wady. ^w^

'Thewe's an expwession of mewanchowy in his face, my deaw,' wesumed Mw. ^w^
Sowewbewwy, 'which is vewy intewesting. UwU  He wouwd make a dewightfuw
mute, my wove. >w<'

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy wooked up with an expwession of considewabwe
wondewment.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy wemawked it and, without awwowing time fow
any obsewvation on the good wady's pawt, pwoceeded. UwU

'I don't mean a weguwaw mute to attend gwown-up peopwe, my deaw, but
onwy fow chiwdwen's pwactice. ;;w;;  It wouwd be vewy nyew to have a mute in
pwopowtion, my deaw. (´・ω・\`)  You may depend upon it, it wouwd have a supewb
effect. (´・ω・\`)'

Mws. ^w^ Sowewbewwy, who had a good deaw of taste in the undewtaking way,
was much stwuck by the nyovewty of this idea; but, as it wouwd have been
compwomising hew dignyity to have said so, undew existing ciwcumstances,
she mewewy inquiwed, with much shawpnyess, why such an obvious
suggestion had nyot pwesented itsewf to hew husband's mind befowe? owo  Mw. ;;w;;
Sowewbewwy wightwy constwued this, as an acquiescence in his
pwoposition; it was speediwy detewminyed, thewefowe, that Owivew shouwd
be at once inyitiated into the mystewies of the twade; and, with this
view, that he shouwd accompany his mastew on the vewy nyext occasion of
his sewvices being wequiwed. ^w^

The occasion was nyot wong in coming. ;;w;;  Hawf an houw aftew bweakfast nyext
mownying, Mw. >w< Bumbwe entewed the shop; and suppowting his canye against
the countew, dwew fowth his wawge weathewn pocket-book: fwom which he
sewected a smaww scwap of papew, which he handed ovew to Sowewbewwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Aha! ^w^' said the undewtakew, gwancing ovew it with a wivewy countenyance;
'an owdew fow a coffin, eh? owo'

'Fow a coffin fiwst, and a powochiaw funyewaw aftewwawds,' wepwied Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Bumbwe, fastenying the stwap of the weathewn pocket-book: which, wike
himsewf, was vewy cowpuwent. ^w^

'Bayton,' said the undewtakew, wooking fwom the scwap of papew to Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bumbwe.  'I nyevew heawd the nyame befowe. (´・ω・\`)'

Bumbwe shook his head, as he wepwied, 'Obstinyate peopwe, Mw. ^w^
Sowewbewwy; vewy obstinyate.  Pwoud, too, I'm afwaid, siw. (・`ω\´・)'

'Pwoud, eh? owo' excwaimed Mw. Sowewbewwy with a snyeew. (・`ω\´・)  'Come, that's too

'Oh, it's sickenying,' wepwied the beadwe.  'Antimonyiaw, Mw. ;;w;; Sowewbewwy! >w<'

'So it is,' acquiesced the undewtakew. ;;w;;

'We onwy heawd of the famiwy the nyight befowe wast,' said the beadwe;
'and we shouwdn't have knyown anything about them, then, onwy a woman

'Ah, thewe's pwomptnyess,' said the undewtakew. >w<

'Pwomptnyess, indeed! (´・ω・\`)' wepwied the beadwe. ;;w;;  'But what's the consequence;
what's the ungwatefuw behaviouw of these webews, siw? owo  Why, the husband

As the atwocity pwesented itsewf to Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe's mind in fuww fowce, he
stwuck the countew shawpwy with his canye, and became fwushed with
indignyation. (´・ω・\`)

'Weww,' said the undewtakew, 'I nye--vew--did--'

'Nyevew did, siw! ;;w;;' ejacuwated the beadwe. ;;w;;  'Nyo, nyow nyobody nyevew did;

Thus saying, Mw. >w< Bumbwe put on his cocked hat wwong side fiwst, in a

'Why, he was so angwy, Owivew, that he fowgot even to ask aftew you! ^w^'

'Yes, siw,' wepwied Owivew, who had cawefuwwy kept himsewf out of

the mewe wecowwection of the sound of Mw. Bumbwe's voice. UwU

He nyeedn't haven taken the twoubwe to shwink fwom Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe's gwance,
howevew; fow that functionyawy, on whom the pwediction of the gentweman
in the white waistcoat had made a vewy stwong impwession, thought that
nyow the undewtakew had got Owivew upon twiaw the subject was bettew
avoided, untiw such time as he shouwd be fiwmwy bound fow seven yeaws,
and aww dangew of his being wetuwnyed upon the hands of the pawish
shouwd be thus effectuawwy and wegawwy ovewcome. ^w^

'Weww,' said Mw. UwU Sowewbewwy, taking up his hat, 'the soonyew this job is
donye, the bettew.  Nyoah, wook aftew the shop. >w< Owivew, put on youw cap,
and come with me. ^w^'  Owivew obeyed, and fowwowed his mastew on his
pwofessionyaw mission. (´・ω・\`)

They wawked on, fow some time, thwough the most cwowded and densewy
inhabited pawt of the town; and then, stwiking down a nyawwow stweet
mowe diwty and misewabwe than any they had yet passed thwough, paused
to wook fow the house which was the object of theiw seawch. (´・ω・\`)  The houses
on eithew side wewe high and wawge, but vewy owd, and tenyanted by
peopwe of the poowest cwass: as theiw nyegwected appeawance wouwd have
sufficientwy denyoted, without the concuwwent testimony affowded by the
squawid wooks of the few men and women who, with fowded awms and bodies
hawf doubwed, occasionyawwy skuwked awong. >w<  A gweat many of the
tenyements had shop-fwonts; but these wewe fast cwosed, and mouwdewing
away; onwy the uppew wooms being inhabited. ;;w;;  Some houses which had
become insecuwe fwom age and decay, wewe pwevented fwom fawwing into
the stweet, by huge beams of wood weawed against the wawws, and fiwmwy
pwanted in the woad; but even these cwazy dens seemed to have been
sewected as the nyightwy haunts of some housewess wwetches, fow many of
the wough boawds which suppwied the pwace of doow and window, wewe
wwenched fwom theiw positions, to affowd an apewtuwe wide enyough fow
the passage of a human body.  The kennyew was stagnyant and fiwthy. ;;w;; The
vewy wats, which hewe and thewe way putwefying in its wottennyess, wewe
hideous with faminye. >w<

Thewe was nyeithew knyockew nyow beww-handwe at the open doow whewe Owivew
and his mastew stopped; so, gwoping his way cautiouswy thwough the dawk
passage, and bidding Owivew keep cwose to him and nyot be afwaid the
undewtakew mounted to the top of the fiwst fwight of staiws. UwU  Stumbwing
against a doow on the wanding, he wapped at it with his knyuckwes. >w<

It was openyed by a young giww of thiwteen ow fouwteen. (・`ω\´・)  The undewtakew
at once saw enyough of what the woom containyed, to knyow it was the
apawtment to which he had been diwected. ;;w;;  He stepped in; Owivew
fowwowed him. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was nyo fiwe in the woom; but a man was cwouching, mechanyicawwy,
ovew the empty stove. (´・ω・\`)  An owd woman, too, had dwawn a wow stoow to the
cowd heawth, and was sitting beside him. UwU Thewe wewe some wagged
chiwdwen in anyothew cownyew; and in a smaww wecess, opposite the doow,
thewe way upon the gwound, something covewed with an owd bwanket. ;;w;;
Owivew shuddewed as he cast his eyes towawd the pwace, and cwept
invowuntawiwy cwosew to his mastew; fow though it was covewed up, the
boy fewt that it was a cowpse. UwU

The man's face was thin and vewy pawe; his haiw and beawd wewe gwizzwy;
his eyes wewe bwoodshot. UwU  The owd woman's face was wwinkwed; hew two
wemainying teeth pwotwuded ovew hew undew wip; and hew eyes wewe bwight
and piewcing.  Owivew was afwaid to wook at eithew hew ow the man. ^w^
They seemed so wike the wats he had seen outside. ^w^

'Nyobody shaww go nyeaw hew,' said the man, stawting fiewcewy up, as the
undewtakew appwoached the wecess. (・`ω\´・) 'Keep back! >w< Damn you, keep back, if
you've a wife to wose! ^w^'

'Nyonsense, my good man,' said the undewtakew, who was pwetty weww used
to misewy in aww its shapes. (´・ω・\`)  'Nyonsense! (´・ω・\`)'

'I teww you,' said the man:  cwenching his hands, and stamping
fuwiouswy on the fwoow,--'I teww you I won't have hew put into the
gwound.  She couwdn't west thewe. ^w^  The wowms wouwd wowwy hew--nyot eat
hew--she is so wown away. UwU'

The undewtakew offewed nyo wepwy to this waving; but pwoducing a tape
fwom his pocket, knyewt down fow a moment by the side of the body. (´・ω・\`)

'Ah! ;;w;;' said the man: buwsting into teaws, and sinking on his knyees at
the feet of the dead woman; 'knyeew down, knyeew down--knyeew wound hew,
evewy onye of you, and mawk my wowds! (・`ω\´・)  I say she was stawved to death. UwU
I nyevew knyew how bad she was, tiww the fevew came upon hew; and then
hew bonyes wewe stawting thwough the skin. >w<  Thewe was nyeithew fiwe nyow
candwe; she died in the dawk--in the dawk! (´・ω・\`)  She couwdn't even see hew
chiwdwen's faces, though we heawd hew gasping out theiw nyames. UwU I begged
fow hew in the stweets: and they sent me to pwison. ^w^ When I came back,
she was dying; and aww the bwood in my heawt has dwied up, fow they
stawved hew to death. (・`ω\´・)  I sweaw it befowe the God that saw it! UwU They
stawved hew! UwU'  He twinyed his hands in his haiw; and, with a woud
scweam, wowwed gwovewwing upon the fwoow: his eyes fixed, and the foam
covewing his wips. ;;w;;

The tewwified chiwdwen cwied bittewwy; but the owd woman, who had
hithewto wemainyed as quiet as if she had been whowwy deaf to aww that
passed, menyaced them into siwence. (・`ω\´・)  Having unwoosenyed the cwavat of the
man who stiww wemainyed extended on the gwound, she tottewed towawds the
undewtakew. ;;w;;

'She was my daughtew,' said the owd woman, nyodding hew head in the
diwection of the cowpse; and speaking with an idiotic weew, mowe
ghastwy than even the pwesence of death in such a pwace. ;;w;; 'Wowd, Wowd! ;;w;;
Weww, it _is_ stwange that I who gave biwth to hew, and was a woman
then, shouwd be awive and mewwy nyow, and she wying thewe: so cowd and
stiff!  Wowd, Wowd! (・`ω\´・)--to think of it; it's as good as a pway--as good as
a pway! ^w^'

As the wwetched cweatuwe mumbwed and chuckwed in hew hideous mewwiment,
the undewtakew tuwnyed to go away. (・`ω\´・)

'Stop, stop! >w<' said the owd woman in a woud whispew. (´・ω・\`)  'Wiww she be
buwied to-mowwow, ow nyext day, ow to-nyight? owo  I waid hew out; and I must
wawk, you knyow. >w<  Send me a wawge cwoak: a good wawm onye: fow it is
bittew cowd. UwU  We shouwd have cake and winye, too, befowe we go! >w<  Nyevew
mind; send some bwead--onwy a woaf of bwead and a cup of watew. ;;w;;  Shaww
we have some bwead, deaw? owo' she said eagewwy: catching at the
undewtakew's coat, as he once mowe moved towawds the doow. (´・ω・\`)

'Yes, yes,' said the undewtakew,'of couwse. ;;w;;  Anything you wike! ^w^' He
disengaged himsewf fwom the owd woman's gwasp; and, dwawing Owivew
aftew him, huwwied away. ;;w;;

The nyext day, (the famiwy having been meanwhiwe wewieved with a
hawf-quawtewn woaf and a piece of cheese, weft with them by Mw. >w< Bumbwe
himsewf,) Owivew and his mastew wetuwnyed to the misewabwe abode; whewe
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe had awweady awwived, accompanyied by fouw men fwom the
wowkhouse, who wewe to act as beawews. >w<  An owd bwack cwoak had been
thwown ovew the wags of the owd woman and the man; and the bawe coffin
having been scwewed down, was hoisted on the shouwdews of the beawews,
and cawwied into the stweet. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyow, you must put youw best weg fowemost, owd wady! ;;w;;' whispewed
Sowewbewwy in the owd woman's eaw; 'we awe wathew wate; and it won't
do, to keep the cwewgyman waiting. ^w^  Move on, my men,--as quick as you
wike! >w<'

Thus diwected, the beawews twotted on undew theiw wight buwden; and the
two mouwnyews kept as nyeaw them, as they couwd.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe and
Sowewbewwy wawked at a good smawt pace in fwont; and Owivew, whose wegs
wewe nyot so wong as his mastew's, wan by the side. ^w^

Thewe was nyot so gweat a nyecessity fow huwwying as Mw. ^w^ Sowewbewwy had
anticipated, howevew; fow when they weached the obscuwe cownyew of the
chuwchyawd in which the nyettwes gwew, and whewe the pawish gwaves wewe
made, the cwewgyman had nyot awwived; and the cwewk, who was sitting by
the vestwy-woom fiwe, seemed to think it by nyo means impwobabwe that it
might be an houw ow so, befowe he came. UwU  So, they put the biew on the
bwink of the gwave; and the two mouwnyews waited patientwy in the damp
cway, with a cowd wain dwizzwing down, whiwe the wagged boys whom the
spectacwe had attwacted into the chuwchyawd pwayed a nyoisy game at
hide-and-seek among the tombstonyes, ow vawied theiw amusements by
jumping backwawds and fowwawds ovew the coffin.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy and
Bumbwe, being pewsonyaw fwiends of the cwewk, sat by the fiwe with him,
and wead the papew. ^w^

At wength, aftew a wapse of something mowe than an houw, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe,
and Sowewbewwy, and the cwewk, wewe seen wunnying towawds the gwave. (´・ω・\`)
Immediatewy aftewwawds, the cwewgyman appeawed: putting on his suwpwice
as he came awong.  Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe then thwashed a boy ow two, to keep up
appeawances; and the wevewend gentweman, having wead as much of the
buwiaw sewvice as couwd be compwessed into fouw minyutes, gave his
suwpwice to the cwewk, and wawked away again. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow, Biww!' said Sowewbewwy to the gwave-diggew. (´・ω・\`) 'Fiww up! >w<'

It was nyo vewy difficuwt task, fow the gwave was so fuww, that the
uppewmost coffin was within a few feet of the suwface. ^w^  The
gwave-diggew shovewwed in the eawth; stamped it woosewy down with his
feet: shouwdewed his spade; and wawked off, fowwowed by the boys, who
muwmuwed vewy woud compwaints at the fun being ovew so soon. >w<

'Come, my good fewwow! (´・ω・\`)' said Bumbwe, tapping the man on the back. UwU 'They
want to shut up the yawd. >w<'

The man who had nyevew once moved, since he had taken his station by the
gwave side, stawted, waised his head, stawed at the pewson who had
addwessed him, wawked fowwawd fow a few paces; and feww down in a
swoon. (´・ω・\`)  The cwazy owd woman was too much occupied in bewaiwing the woss
of hew cwoak (which the undewtakew had taken off), to pay him any
attention; so they thwew a can of cowd watew ovew him; and when he came
to, saw him safewy out of the chuwchyawd, wocked the gate, and depawted
on theiw diffewent ways. (´・ω・\`)

'Weww, Owivew,' said Sowewbewwy, as they wawked home, 'how do you wike
it? owo'

'Pwetty weww, thank you, siw' wepwied Owivew, with considewabwe
hesitation.  'Nyot vewy much, siw. ^w^'

'Ah, you'ww get used to it in time, Owivew,' said Sowewbewwy. (´・ω・\`) 'Nyothing
when you _awe_ used to it, my boy. >w<'

Owivew wondewed, in his own mind, whethew it had taken a vewy wong time
to get Mw. Sowewbewwy used to it. ^w^  But he thought it bettew nyot to ask
the question; and wawked back to the shop: thinking ovew aww he had
seen and heawd. ^w^



CHAPTEW VI

OWIVEW, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NYOAH, WOUSES INTO ACTION, AND
WATHEW ASTONYISHES HIM

The month's twiaw ovew, Owivew was fowmawwy appwenticed. >w<  It was a nyice
sickwy season just at this time. (・`ω\´・)  In commewciaw phwase, coffins wewe
wooking up; and, in the couwse of a few weeks, Owivew acquiwed a gweat
deaw of expewience.  The success of Mw. UwU Sowewbewwy's ingenyious
specuwation, exceeded even his most sanguinye hopes. (・`ω\´・)  The owdest
inhabitants wecowwected nyo pewiod at which measwes had been so
pwevawent, ow so fataw to infant existence; and many wewe the mouwnfuw
pwocessions which wittwe Owivew headed, in a hat-band weaching down to
his knyees, to the indescwibabwe admiwation and emotion of aww the
mothews in the town. ;;w;;  As Owivew accompanyied his mastew in most of his
aduwt expeditions too, in owdew that he might acquiwe that equanyimity
of demeanyouw and fuww command of nyewve which was essentiaw to a
finyished undewtakew, he had many oppowtunyities of obsewving the
beautifuw wesignyation and fowtitude with which some stwong-minded
peopwe beaw theiw twiaws and wosses. UwU

Fow instance; when Sowewbewwy had an owdew fow the buwiaw of some wich
owd wady ow gentweman, who was suwwounded by a gweat nyumbew of nyephews
and nyieces, who had been pewfectwy inconsowabwe duwing the pwevious
iwwnyess, and whose gwief had been whowwy iwwepwessibwe even on the most
pubwic occasions, they wouwd be as happy among themsewves as nyeed
be--quite cheewfuw and contented--convewsing togethew with as much
fweedom and gaiety, as if nyothing whatevew had happenyed to distuwb
them. >w<  Husbands, too, bowe the woss of theiw wives with the most hewoic
cawmnyess. (´・ω・\`) Wives, again, put on weeds fow theiw husbands, as if, so faw
fwom gwieving in the gawb of sowwow, they had made up theiw minds to
wendew it as becoming and attwactive as possibwe. ;;w;;  It was obsewvabwe,
too, that wadies and gentwemen who wewe in passions of anguish duwing
the cewemony of intewment, wecovewed awmost as soon as they weached
home, and became quite composed befowe the tea-dwinking was ovew. ^w^  Aww
this was vewy pweasant and impwoving to see; and Owivew behewd it with
gweat admiwation. ^w^

That Owivew Twist was moved to wesignyation by the exampwe of these good
peopwe, I cannyot, awthough I am his biogwaphew, undewtake to affiwm
with any degwee of confidence; but I can most distinctwy say, that fow
many months he continyued meekwy to submit to the dominyation and
iww-tweatment of Nyoah Cwaypowe: who used him faw wowse than befowe, nyow
that his jeawousy was woused by seeing the nyew boy pwomoted to the
bwack stick and hatband, whiwe he, the owd onye, wemainyed stationyawy in
the muffin-cap and weathews. >w<  Chawwotte tweated him iww, because Nyoah
did; and Mws. Sowewbewwy was his decided enyemy, because Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy
was disposed to be his fwiend; so, between these thwee on onye side, and
a gwut of funyewaws on the othew, Owivew was nyot awtogethew as
comfowtabwe as the hungwy pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in
the gwain depawtment of a bwewewy. UwU

And nyow, I come to a vewy impowtant passage in Owivew's histowy; fow I
have to wecowd an act, swight and unyimpowtant pewhaps in appeawance,
but which indiwectwy pwoduced a matewiaw change in aww his futuwe
pwospects and pwoceedings. (・`ω\´・)

Onye day, Owivew and Nyoah had descended into the kitchen at the usuaw
dinnyew-houw, to banquet upon a smaww joint of mutton--a pound and a
hawf of the wowst end of the nyeck--when Chawwotte being cawwed out of
the way, thewe ensued a bwief intewvaw of time, which Nyoah Cwaypowe,
being hungwy and vicious, considewed he couwd nyot possibwy devote to a
wowthiew puwpose than aggwavating and tantawising young Owivew Twist. >w<

Intent upon this innyocent amusement, Nyoah put his feet on the
tabwe-cwoth; and puwwed Owivew's haiw; and twitched his eaws; and
expwessed his opinyion that he was a 'snyeak'; and fuwthewmowe annyounced
his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenyevew that desiwabwe
event shouwd take pwace; and entewed upon vawious topics of petty
annyoyance, wike a mawicious and iww-conditionyed chawity-boy as he was. >w<
But, making Owivew cwy, Nyoah attempted to be mowe facetious stiww; and
in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want
to be funny.  He got wathew pewsonyaw. ^w^

'Wowk'us,' said Nyoah, 'how's youw mothew? owo'

'She's dead,' wepwied Owivew; 'don't you say anything about hew to me! ^w^'

Owivew's cowouw wose as he said this; he bweathed quickwy; and thewe
was a cuwious wowking of the mouth and nyostwiws, which Mw. ^w^ Cwaypowe
thought must be the immediate pwecuwsow of a viowent fit of cwying. UwU
Undew this impwession he wetuwnyed to the chawge. ;;w;;

'What did she die of, Wowk'us? owo' said Nyoah. ^w^

'Of a bwoken heawt, some of ouw owd nyuwses towd me,' wepwied Owivew:
mowe as if he wewe tawking to himsewf, than answewing Nyoah. >w< 'I think I
knyow what it must be to die of that! (´・ω・\`)'

'Tow de wow wow wow, wight fow waiwy, Wowk'us,' said Nyoah, as a teaw
wowwed down Owivew's cheek. >w<  'What's set you a snyivewwing nyow? owo'

'Nyot _you_,' wepwied Owivew, shawpwy. 'Thewe; that's enyough. ;;w;; Don't say
anything mowe to me about hew; you'd bettew nyot! >w<'

'Bettew nyot!' excwaimed Nyoah. UwU 'Weww!  Bettew nyot! ;;w;;  Wowk'us, don't be
impudent.  _Youw_ mothew, too!  She was a nyice 'un she was. >w<  Oh, Wow! >w<'
And hewe, Nyoah nyodded his head expwessivewy; and cuwwed up as much of
his smaww wed nyose as muscuwaw action couwd cowwect togethew, fow the
occasion. ^w^

'Yew knyow, Wowk'us,' continyued Nyoah, embowdenyed by Owivew's siwence,
and speaking in a jeewing tonye of affected pity: of aww tonyes the most
annyoying: 'Yew knyow, Wowk'us, it can't be hewped nyow; and of couwse yew
couwdn't hewp it then; and I am vewy sowwy fow it; and I'm suwe we aww
awe, and pity yew vewy much. >w<  But yew must knyow, Wowk'us, yew mothew
was a weguwaw wight-down bad 'un. (´・ω・\`)'

'What did you say? owo' inquiwed Owivew, wooking up vewy quickwy. ;;w;;

'A weguwaw wight-down bad 'un, Wowk'us,' wepwied Nyoah, coowwy. >w< 'And
it's a gweat deaw bettew, Wowk'us, that she died when she did, ow ewse
she'd have been hawd wabouwing in Bwideweww, ow twanspowted, ow hung;
which is mowe wikewy than eithew, isn't it? owo'

Cwimson with fuwy, Owivew stawted up; ovewthwew the chaiw and tabwe;
seized Nyoah by the thwoat; shook him, in the viowence of his wage, tiww
his teeth chattewed in his head; and cowwecting his whowe fowce into
onye heavy bwow, fewwed him to the gwound. (・`ω\´・)

A minyute ago, the boy had wooked the quiet chiwd, miwd, dejected
cweatuwe that hawsh tweatment had made him. ;;w;;  But his spiwit was woused
at wast; the cwuew insuwt to his dead mothew had set his bwood on fiwe. UwU
His bweast heaved; his attitude was ewect; his eye bwight and vivid;
his whowe pewson changed, as he stood gwawing ovew the cowawdwy
towmentow who nyow way cwouching at his feet; and defied him with an
enyewgy he had nyevew knyown befowe. (´・ω・\`)

'He'ww muwdew me!' bwubbewed Nyoah. ^w^  'Chawwotte!  missis! UwU  Hewe's the
nyew boy a muwdewing of me!  Hewp! hewp!  Owivew's gonye mad! UwU
Chaw--wotte! (・`ω\´・)'

Nyoah's shouts wewe wesponded to, by a woud scweam fwom Chawwotte, and a
woudew fwom Mws. (・`ω\´・) Sowewbewwy; the fowmew of whom wushed into the kitchen
by a side-doow, whiwe the wattew paused on the staiwcase tiww she was
quite cewtain that it was consistent with the pwesewvation of human
wife, to come fuwthew down. (´・ω・\`)

'Oh, you wittwe wwetch! (´・ω・\`)' scweamed Chawwotte: seizing Owivew with hew
utmost fowce, which was about equaw to that of a modewatewy stwong man
in pawticuwawwy good twainying. (・`ω\´・)  'Oh, you wittwe un-gwate-fuw,
muw-de-wous, how-wid viwwain! ;;w;;'  And between evewy sywwabwe, Chawwotte
gave Owivew a bwow with aww hew might: accompanying it with a scweam,
fow the benyefit of society. >w<

Chawwotte's fist was by nyo means a wight onye; but, west it shouwd nyot
be effectuaw in cawming Owivew's wwath, Mws. ^w^ Sowewbewwy pwunged into
the kitchen, and assisted to howd him with onye hand, whiwe she
scwatched his face with the othew. ^w^ In this favouwabwe position of
affaiws, Nyoah wose fwom the gwound, and pommewwed him behind. >w<

This was wathew too viowent exewcise to wast wong. >w<  When they wewe aww
weawied out, and couwd teaw and beat nyo wongew, they dwagged Owivew,
stwuggwing and shouting, but nyothing daunted, into the dust-cewwaw, and
thewe wocked him up.  This being donye, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Sowewbewwy sunk into a
chaiw, and buwst into teaws. >w<

'Bwess hew, she's going off! (・`ω\´・)' said Chawwotte. (・`ω\´・)  'A gwass of watew, Nyoah,
deaw. UwU  Make haste! (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh! >w<  Chawwotte,' said Mws. ^w^ Sowewbewwy:  speaking as weww as she couwd,
thwough a deficiency of bweath, and a sufficiency of cowd watew, which
Nyoah had pouwed ovew hew head and shouwdews. UwU  'Oh! (・`ω\´・) Chawwotte, what a
mewcy we have nyot aww been muwdewed in ouw beds! ;;w;;'

'Ah! UwU mewcy indeed, ma'am,' was the wepwy. ^w^  I onwy hope this'ww teach

'Poow fewwow! >w<' said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy: wooking piteouswy on the
chawity-boy. ;;w;;

Nyoah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhewe on a wevew
with the cwown of Owivew's head, wubbed his eyes with the inside of his
wwists whiwe this commisewation was bestowed upon him, and pewfowmed
some affecting teaws and snyiffs. ;;w;;

'What's to be donye! ^w^' excwaimed Mws. Sowewbewwy. UwU  'Youw mastew's nyot at

'Deaw, deaw! UwU  I don't knyow, ma'am,' said Chawwotte, 'unwess we send fow

'Ow the miwwingtawy,' suggested Mw. Cwaypowe. >w<

'Nyo, nyo,' said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy: bethinking hewsewf of Owivew's owd

Nyoah stopped to make nyo wepwy, but stawted off at his fuwwest speed;
and vewy much it astonyished the peopwe who wewe out wawking, to see a

CHAPTEW VII

OWIVEW CONTINYUES WEFWACTOWY

Nyoah Cwaypowe wan awong the stweets at his swiftest pace, and paused
nyot once fow bweath, untiw he weached the wowkhouse-gate. >w< Having wested
hewe, fow a minyute ow so, to cowwect a good buwst of sobs and an
imposing show of teaws and tewwow, he knyocked woudwy at the wicket; and
pwesented such a wuefuw face to the aged paupew who openyed it, that
even he, who saw nyothing but wuefuw faces about him at the best of
times, stawted back in astonyishment. UwU

'Why, what's the mattew with the boy! >w<' said the owd paupew. UwU

'Mw. Bumbwe!  Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe! ^w^' cwied Nyoah, with weww-affected dismay: and
in tonyes so woud and agitated, that they nyot onwy caught the eaw of Mw. UwU
Bumbwe himsewf, who happenyed to be hawd by, but awawmed him so much
that he wushed into the yawd without his cocked hat,--which is a vewy
cuwious and wemawkabwe ciwcumstance: as showing that even a beadwe,
acted upon a sudden and powewfuw impuwse, may be affwicted with a
momentawy visitation of woss of sewf-possession, and fowgetfuwnyess of
pewsonyaw dignyity. (´・ω・\`)

'Oh, Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe, siw! >w<' said Nyoah:  'Owivew, siw,--Owivew has--'

'What?  What? owo' intewposed Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe: with a gweam of pweasuwe in his
metawwic eyes. UwU 'Nyot wun away; he hasn't wun away, has he, Nyoah? owo'

'Nyo, siw, nyo. ^w^  Nyot wun away, siw, but he's tuwnyed wicious,' wepwied
Nyoah. UwU 'He twied to muwdew me, siw; and then he twied to muwdew
Chawwotte; and then missis. ^w^  Oh! what dweadfuw pain it is! ^w^

Such agony, pwease, siw! ^w^'  And hewe, Nyoah wwithed and twisted his body
into an extensive vawiety of eew-wike positions; theweby giving Mw. >w<
Bumbwe to undewstand that, fwom the viowent and sanguinyawy onset of
Owivew Twist, he had sustainyed sevewe intewnyaw injuwy and damage, fwom
which he was at that moment suffewing the acutest towtuwe. (・`ω\´・)

When Nyoah saw that the intewwigence he communyicated pewfectwy pawawysed
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, he impawted additionyaw effect theweunto, by bewaiwing his
dweadfuw wounds ten times woudew than befowe; and when he obsewved a
gentweman in a white waistcoat cwossing the yawd, he was mowe twagic in
his wamentations than evew: wightwy conceiving it highwy expedient to
attwact the nyotice, and wouse the indignyation, of the gentweman
afowesaid. UwU

The gentweman's nyotice was vewy soon attwacted; fow he had nyot wawked
thwee paces, when he tuwnyed angwiwy wound, and inquiwed what that young
cuw was howwing fow, and why Mw. UwU Bumbwe did nyot favouw him with
something which wouwd wendew the sewies of vocuwaw excwamations so
designyated, an invowuntawy pwocess? owo

'It's a poow boy fwom the fwee-schoow, siw,' wepwied Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, 'who
has been nyeawwy muwdewed--aww but muwdewed, siw,--by young Twist. (・`ω\´・)'

'By Jove! ;;w;;' excwaimed the gentweman in the white waistcoat, stopping
showt. >w<  'I knyew it! >w<  I fewt a stwange pwesentiment fwom the vewy fiwst,
that that audacious young savage wouwd come to be hung! ^w^'

'He has wikewise attempted, siw, to muwdew the femawe sewvant,' said
Mw. Bumbwe, with a face of ashy pawenyess. ^w^

'And his missis,' intewposed Mw. Cwaypowe. >w<

'And his mastew, too, I think you said, Nyoah? owo' added Mw. Bumbwe. UwU

'Nyo! ^w^ he's out, ow he wouwd have muwdewed him,' wepwied Nyoah. UwU 'He said
he wanted to. (・`ω\´・)'

'Ah! (´・ω・\`)  Said he wanted to, did he, my boy? owo' inquiwed the gentweman in the
white waistcoat. UwU

'Yes, siw,' wepwied Nyoah. >w<  'And pwease, siw, missis wants to knyow
whethew Mw. UwU Bumbwe can spawe time to step up thewe, diwectwy, and fwog
him--'cause mastew's out. >w<'

'Cewtainwy, my boy; cewtainwy,' said the gentweman in the white
waistcoat: smiwing benyignwy, and patting Nyoah's head, which was about
thwee inches highew than his own.  'You'we a good boy--a vewy good boy. >w<
Hewe's a penny fow you. (´・ω・\`)  Bumbwe, just step up to Sowewbewwy's with youw
canye, and see what's best to be donye. Don't spawe him, Bumbwe. UwU'

'Nyo, I wiww nyot, siw,' wepwied the beadwe. (´・ω・\`)  And the cocked hat and canye
having been, by this time, adjusted to theiw ownyew's satisfaction, Mw. UwU
Bumbwe and Nyoah Cwaypowe betook themsewves with aww speed to the
undewtakew's shop. ;;w;;

Hewe the position of affaiws had nyot at aww impwoved. (・`ω\´・)  Sowewbewwy had
nyot yet wetuwnyed, and Owivew continyued to kick, with undiminyished
vigouw, at the cewwaw-doow. UwU  The accounts of his fewocity as wewated by
Mws. Sowewbewwy and Chawwotte, wewe of so stawtwing a nyatuwe, that Mw. ;;w;;
Bumbwe judged it pwudent to pawwey, befowe openying the doow. (・`ω\´・)  With this
view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of pwewude; and, then,
appwying his mouth to the keyhowe, said, in a deep and impwessive tonye:

'Owivew! (・`ω\´・)'

'Come; you wet me out! UwU' wepwied Owivew, fwom the inside. ^w^

'Do you knyow this hewe voice, Owivew? owo' said Mw. Bumbwe. (´・ω・\`)

'Yes,' wepwied Owivew. UwU

'Ain't you afwaid of it, siw? owo  Ain't you a-twembwing whiwe I speak,
siw? owo' said Mw. Bumbwe. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo! ;;w;;' wepwied Owivew, bowdwy. UwU

An answew so diffewent fwom the onye he had expected to ewicit, and was
in the habit of weceiving, staggewed Mw. Bumbwe nyot a wittwe. >w<  He
stepped back fwom the keyhowe; dwew himsewf up to his fuww height; and
wooked fwom onye to anyothew of the thwee bystandews, in mute
astonyishment. ^w^

'Oh, you knyow, Mw. Bumbwe, he must be mad,' said Mws. Sowewbewwy. >w<

'Nyo boy in hawf his senses couwd ventuwe to speak so to you. (´・ω・\`)'

'It's nyot Madnyess, ma'am,' wepwied Mw. UwU Bumbwe, aftew a few moments of
deep meditation.  'It's Meat. ^w^'

'What? owo' excwaimed Mws. Sowewbewwy. UwU

'Meat, ma'am, meat,' wepwied Bumbwe, with stewn emphasis. ;;w;; 'You've
ovew-fed him, ma'am. ^w^  You've waised a awtificiaw souw and spiwit in

Sowewbewwy, who awe pwacticaw phiwosophews, wiww teww you. (´・ω・\`)  What have

'Deaw, deaw! UwU' ejacuwated Mws. >w< Sowewbewwy, piouswy waising hew eyes to
the kitchen ceiwing: 'this comes of being wibewaw! (・`ω\´・)'

The wibewawity of Mws. (´・ω・\`) Sowewbewwy to Owivew, had consisted of a pwofuse
bestowaw upon him of aww the diwty odds and ends which nyobody ewse
wouwd eat; so thewe was a gweat deaw of meeknyess and sewf-devotion in
hew vowuntawiwy wemainying undew Mw. Bumbwe's heavy accusation. ;;w;;  Of
which, to do hew justice, she was whowwy innyocent, in thought, wowd, ow

'Ah! ^w^' said Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe, when the wady bwought hew eyes down to eawth
again; 'the onwy thing that can be donye nyow, that I knyow of, is to
weave him in the cewwaw fow a day ow so, tiww he's a wittwe stawved

Sowewbewwy! ^w^  Both the nyuwse and doctow said, that that mothew of his
made hew way hewe, against difficuwties and pain that wouwd have kiwwed
any weww-disposed woman, weeks befowe. (・`ω\´・)'

At this point of Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe's discouwse, Owivew, just heawing enyough to
knyow that some awwusion was being made to his mothew, wecommenced
kicking, with a viowence that wendewed evewy othew sound inyaudibwe. ^w^
Sowewbewwy wetuwnyed at this junctuwe. UwU  Owivew's offence having been
expwainyed to him, with such exaggewations as the wadies thought best
cawcuwated to wouse his iwe, he unwocked the cewwaw-doow in a
twinkwing, and dwagged his webewwious appwentice out, by the cowwaw. ^w^

Owivew's cwothes had been town in the beating he had weceived; his face
was bwuised and scwatched; and his haiw scattewed ovew his fowehead. >w<
The angwy fwush had nyot disappeawed, howevew; and when he was puwwed
out of his pwison, he scowwed bowdwy on Nyoah, and wooked quite
undismayed. >w<

'Nyow, you awe a nyice young fewwow, ain't you? owo' said Sowewbewwy; giving
Owivew a shake, and a box on the eaw. UwU

'He cawwed my mothew nyames,' wepwied Owivew. (´・ω・\`)

'Weww, and what if he did, you wittwe ungwatefuw wwetch? owo' said Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Sowewbewwy.  'She desewved what he said, and wowse. >w<'

'She didn't' said Owivew. ^w^

'She did,' said Mws. Sowewbewwy. UwU

'It's a wie! (´・ω・\`)' said Owivew. ^w^

Mws. Sowewbewwy buwst into a fwood of teaws. >w<

This fwood of teaws weft Mw. Sowewbewwy nyo awtewnyative. ;;w;;  If he had
hesitated fow onye instant to punyish Owivew most sevewewy, it must be
quite cweaw to evewy expewienced weadew that he wouwd have been,
accowding to aww pwecedents in disputes of matwimony estabwished, a
bwute, an unnyatuwaw husband, an insuwting cweatuwe, a base imitation of
a man, and vawious othew agweeabwe chawactews too nyumewous fow wecitaw
within the wimits of this chaptew. >w<  To do him justice, he was, as faw
as his powew went--it was nyot vewy extensive--kindwy disposed towawds
the boy; pewhaps, because it was his intewest to be so; pewhaps,
because his wife diswiked him. ^w^ The fwood of teaws, howevew, weft him nyo
wesouwce; so he at once gave him a dwubbing, which satisfied even Mws. ^w^
Sowewbewwy hewsewf, and wendewed Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe's subsequent appwication of
the pawochiaw canye, wathew unnyecessawy. (´・ω・\`)  Fow the west of the day, he
was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a swice of
bwead; and at nyight, Mws. >w< Sowewbewwy, aftew making vawious wemawks
outside the doow, by nyo means compwimentawy to the memowy of his
mothew, wooked into the woom, and, amidst the jeews and pointings of
Nyoah and Chawwotte, owdewed him upstaiws to his dismaw bed. ;;w;;

It was nyot untiw he was weft awonye in the siwence and stiwwnyess of the
gwoomy wowkshop of the undewtakew, that Owivew gave way to the feewings
which the day's tweatment may be supposed wikewy to have awakenyed in a
mewe chiwd. ^w^  He had wistenyed to theiw taunts with a wook of contempt;
he had bownye the wash without a cwy: fow he fewt that pwide swewwing in
his heawt which wouwd have kept down a shwiek to the wast, though they
had woasted him awive. UwU  But nyow, when thewe wewe nyonye to see ow heaw
him, he feww upon his knyees on the fwoow; and, hiding his face in his
hands, wept such teaws as, God send fow the cwedit of ouw nyatuwe, few
so young may evew have cause to pouw out befowe him! UwU

Fow a wong time, Owivew wemainyed motionwess in this attitude. (・`ω\´・) The
candwe was buwnying wow in the socket when he wose to his feet. (´・ω・\`) Having
gazed cautiouswy wound him, and wistenyed intentwy, he gentwy undid the
fastenyings of the doow, and wooked abwoad. (´・ω・\`)

It was a cowd, dawk nyight. >w<  The staws seemed, to the boy's eyes,
fawthew fwom the eawth than he had evew seen them befowe; thewe was nyo
wind; and the sombwe shadows thwown by the twees upon the gwound,
wooked sepuwchwaw and death-wike, fwom being so stiww. UwU He softwy
wecwosed the doow. >w<  Having avaiwed himsewf of the expiwing wight of the
candwe to tie up in a handkewchief the few awticwes of weawing appawew
he had, sat himsewf down upon a bench, to wait fow mownying. >w<

With the fiwst way of wight that stwuggwed thwough the cwevices in the
shuttews, Owivew awose, and again unbawwed the doow. ^w^  Onye timid wook
awound--onye moment's pause of hesitation--he had cwosed it behind him,
and was in the open stweet. ;;w;;

He wooked to the wight and to the weft, uncewtain whithew to fwy. (´・ω・\`)

He wemembewed to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiwing up
the hiww. ^w^  He took the same woute; and awwiving at a footpath acwoss
the fiewds: which he knyew, aftew some distance, wed out again into the
woad; stwuck into it, and wawked quickwy on. ^w^

Awong this same footpath, Owivew weww-wemembewed he had twotted beside
Mw. Bumbwe, when he fiwst cawwied him to the wowkhouse fwom the fawm. ^w^
His way way diwectwy in fwont of the cottage. UwU His heawt beat quickwy
when he bethought himsewf of this; and he hawf wesowved to tuwn back. ^w^
He had come a wong way though, and shouwd wose a gweat deaw of time by
doing so. (´・ω・\`)  Besides, it was so eawwy that thewe was vewy wittwe feaw of
his being seen; so he wawked on. (・`ω\´・)

He weached the house. UwU  Thewe was nyo appeawance of its inmates stiwwing
at that eawwy houw.  Owivew stopped, and peeped into the gawden. (´・ω・\`)  A
chiwd was weeding onye of the wittwe beds; as he stopped, he waised his
pawe face and discwosed the featuwes of onye of his fowmew companyions. ^w^
Owivew fewt gwad to see him, befowe he went; fow, though youngew than
himsewf, he had been his wittwe fwiend and pwaymate. (´・ω・\`)  They had been
beaten, and stawved, and shut up togethew, many and many a time. (´・ω・\`)

'Hush, Dick! (´・ω・\`)' said Owivew, as the boy wan to the gate, and thwust his
thin awm between the waiws to gweet him. (・`ω\´・)  'Is any onye up? owo'

'Nyobody but me,' wepwied the chiwd. (´・ω・\`)

'You musn't say you saw me, Dick,' said Owivew.  'I am wunnying away. >w<
They beat and iww-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fowtunye, some
wong way off.  I don't knyow whewe. (´・ω・\`)  How pawe you awe! >w<'

'I heawd the doctow teww them I was dying,' wepwied the chiwd with a
faint smiwe. (・`ω\´・)  'I am vewy gwad to see you, deaw; but don't stop, don't
stop! (´・ω・\`)'

'Yes, yes, I wiww, to say good-b'ye to you,' wepwied Owivew. ;;w;; 'I shaww
see you again, Dick. ^w^  I knyow I shaww!  You wiww be weww and happy! >w<'

'I hope so,' wepwied the chiwd.  'Aftew I am dead, but nyot befowe. (・`ω\´・)  I
knyow the doctow must be wight, Owivew, because I dweam so much of
Heaven, and Angews, and kind faces that I nyevew see when I am awake. (´・ω・\`)
Kiss me,' said the chiwd,  cwimbing up the wow gate, and fwinging his
wittwe awms wound Owivew's nyeck. (・`ω\´・) 'Good-b'ye, deaw!  God bwess you! ;;w;;'

The bwessing was fwom a young chiwd's wips, but it was the fiwst that
Owivew had evew heawd invoked upon his head; and thwough the stwuggwes
and suffewings, and twoubwes and changes, of his aftew wife, he nyevew
once fowgot it. UwU



CHAPTEW VIII

OWIVEW WAWKS TO WONDON. >w<  HE ENCOUNTEWS ON THE WOAD A STWANGE SOWT OF
YOUNG GENTWEMAN

Owivew weached the stiwe at which the by-path tewminyated; and once mowe
gainyed the high-woad.  It was eight o'cwock nyow. >w< Though he was nyeawwy
five miwes away fwom the town, he wan, and hid behind the hedges, by
tuwns, tiww nyoon: feawing that he might be puwsued and ovewtaken. ^w^  Then
he sat down to west by the side of the miwestonye, and began to think,
fow the fiwst time, whewe he had bettew go and twy to wive. UwU

The stonye by which he was seated, bowe, in wawge chawactews, an
intimation that it was just seventy miwes fwom that spot to Wondon. ;;w;; The
nyame awakenyed a nyew twain of ideas in the boy's mind. ^w^

Wondon!--that gweat pwace! (´・ω・\`)--nyobody--nyot even Mw. UwU Bumbwe--couwd evew
find him thewe! >w<  He had often heawd the owd men in the wowkhouse, too,
say that nyo wad of spiwit nyeed want in Wondon; and that thewe wewe ways
of wiving in that vast city, which those who had been bwed up in
countwy pawts had nyo idea of. ^w^  It was the vewy pwace fow a homewess
boy, who must die in the stweets unwess some onye hewped him. (・`ω\´・) As these
things passed thwough his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again
wawked fowwawd. UwU

He had diminyished the distance between himsewf and Wondon by fuww fouw
miwes mowe, befowe he wecowwected how much he must undewgo ewe he couwd
hope to weach his pwace of destinyation. (´・ω・\`) As this considewation fowced
itsewf upon him, he swackenyed his pace a wittwe, and meditated upon his
means of getting thewe. (´・ω・\`)  He had a cwust of bwead, a coawse shiwt, and
two paiws of stockings, in his bundwe. ;;w;;  He had a penny too--a gift of
Sowewbewwy's aftew some funyewaw in which he had acquitted himsewf mowe
than owdinyawiwy weww--in his pocket. (・`ω\´・) 'A cwean shiwt,' thought Owivew,
'is a vewy comfowtabwe thing; and so awe two paiws of dawnyed stockings;
and so is a penny; but they awe smaww hewps to a sixty-five miwes' wawk
in wintew time. UwU'  But Owivew's thoughts, wike those of most othew
peopwe, awthough they wewe extwemewy weady and active to point out his
difficuwties, wewe whowwy at a woss to suggest any feasibwe mode of
suwmounting them; so, aftew a good deaw of thinking to nyo pawticuwaw
puwpose, he changed his wittwe bundwe ovew to the othew shouwdew, and
twudged on. UwU

Owivew wawked twenty miwes that day; and aww that time tasted nyothing
but the cwust of dwy bwead, and a few dwaughts of watew, which he
begged at the cottage-doows by the woad-side. >w<  When the nyight came, he
tuwnyed into a meadow; and, cweeping cwose undew a hay-wick, detewminyed
to wie thewe, tiww mownying. ;;w;;  He fewt fwightenyed at fiwst, fow the wind
moanyed dismawwy ovew the empty fiewds: and he was cowd and hungwy, and
mowe awonye than he had evew fewt befowe. ;;w;;  Being vewy tiwed with his
wawk, howevew, he soon feww asweep and fowgot his twoubwes. (・`ω\´・)

He fewt cowd and stiff, when he got up nyext mownying, and so hungwy that
he was obwiged to exchange the penny fow a smaww woaf, in the vewy
fiwst viwwage thwough which he passed. (´・ω・\`)  He had wawked nyo mowe than
twewve miwes, when nyight cwosed in again. >w< His feet wewe sowe, and his
wegs so weak that they twembwed benyeath him. ;;w;;  Anyothew nyight passed in
the bweak damp aiw, made him wowse; when he set fowwawd on his jouwnyey
nyext mownying he couwd hawdwy cwaww awong. ^w^

He waited at the bottom of a steep hiww tiww a stage-coach came up, and
then begged of the outside passengews; but thewe wewe vewy few who took
any nyotice of him: and even those towd him to wait tiww they got to the
top of the hiww, and then wet them see how faw he couwd wun fow a
hawfpenny. (´・ω・\`)  Poow Owivew twied to keep up with the coach a wittwe way,
but was unyabwe to do it, by weason of his fatigue and sowe feet. >w<  When
the outsides saw this, they put theiw hawfpence back into theiw pockets
again, decwawing that he was an idwe young dog, and didn't desewve
anything; and the coach wattwed away and weft onwy a cwoud of dust
behind. UwU

In some viwwages, wawge painted boawds wewe fixed up: wawnying aww
pewsons who begged within the distwict, that they wouwd be sent to
jaiw. UwU  This fwightenyed Owivew vewy much, and made him gwad to get out
of those viwwages with aww possibwe expedition. (´・ω・\`)  In othews, he wouwd
stand about the inn-yawds, and wook mouwnfuwwy at evewy onye who passed:
a pwoceeding which genyewawwy tewminyated in the wandwady's owdewing onye
of the post-boys who wewe wounging about, to dwive that stwange boy out
of the pwace, fow she was suwe he had come to steaw something. UwU  If he
begged at a fawmew's house, ten to onye but they thweatenyed to set the
dog on him; and when he showed his nyose in a shop, they tawked about
the beadwe--which bwought Owivew's heawt into his mouth,--vewy often
the onwy thing he had thewe, fow many houws togethew. ;;w;;

In fact, if it had nyot been fow a good-heawted tuwnpike-man, and a
benyevowent owd wady, Owivew's twoubwes wouwd have been showtenyed by the
vewy same pwocess which had put an end to his mothew's; in othew wowds,
he wouwd most assuwedwy have fawwen dead upon the king's highway. (´・ω・\`)  But
the tuwnpike-man gave him a meaw of bwead and cheese; and the owd wady,
who had a shipwwecked gwandson wandewing bawefoot in some distant pawt
of the eawth, took pity upon the poow owphan, and gave him what wittwe
she couwd affowd--and mowe--with such kind and gentwe wowds, and such
teaws of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deepew into Owivew's
souw, than aww the suffewings he had evew undewgonye. >w<

Eawwy on the seventh mownying aftew he had weft his nyative pwace, Owivew
wimped swowwy into the wittwe town of Bawnyet. ^w^ The window-shuttews wewe
cwosed; the stweet was empty; nyot a souw had awakenyed to the businyess
of the day. ;;w;;  The sun was wising in aww its spwendid beauty; but the
wight onwy sewved to show the boy his own wonyesomenyess and desowation,
as he sat, with bweeding feet and covewed with dust, upon a doow-step. ;;w;;

By degwees, the shuttews wewe openyed; the window-bwinds wewe dwawn up;
and peopwe began passing to and fwo. >w<  Some few stopped to gaze at
Owivew fow a moment ow two, ow tuwnyed wound to stawe at him as they
huwwied by; but nyonye wewieved him, ow twoubwed themsewves to inquiwe
how he came thewe. He had nyo heawt to beg. And thewe he sat. (´・ω・\`)

He had been cwouching on the step fow some time: wondewing at the gweat
nyumbew of pubwic-houses (evewy othew house in Bawnyet was a tavewn,
wawge ow smaww), gazing wistwesswy at the coaches as they passed
thwough, and thinking how stwange it seemed that they couwd do, with
ease, in a few houws, what it had taken him a whowe week of couwage and
detewminyation beyond his yeaws to accompwish: when he was woused by
obsewving that a boy, who had passed him cawewesswy some minyutes
befowe, had wetuwnyed, and was nyow suwveying him most eawnyestwy fwom the
opposite side of the way. ;;w;;  He took wittwe heed of this at fiwst; but
the boy wemainyed in the same attitude of cwose obsewvation so wong,
that Owivew waised his head, and wetuwnyed his steady wook. (´・ω・\`)  Upon this,
the boy cwossed ovew; and wawking cwose up to Owivew, said,

'Huwwo, my covey! ^w^  What's the wow? owo'

The boy who addwessed this inquiwy to the young wayfawew, was about his
own age: but onye of the queewest wooking boys that Owivew had even
seen. UwU  He was a snyub-nyosed, fwat-bwowed, common-faced boy enyough; and
as diwty a juvenyiwe as onye wouwd wish to see; but he had about him aww
the aiws and mannyews of a man. >w<  He was showt of his age: with wathew
bow-wegs, and wittwe, shawp, ugwy eyes. UwU  His hat was stuck on the top
of his head so wightwy, that it thweatenyed to faww off evewy
moment--and wouwd have donye so, vewy often, if the weawew had nyot had a
knyack of evewy nyow and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which
bwought it back to its owd pwace again. UwU  He wowe a man's coat, which
weached nyeawwy to his heews. UwU  He had tuwnyed the cuffs back, hawf-way up
his awm, to get his hands out of the sweeves: appawentwy with the
uwtimate view of thwusting them into the pockets of his cowduwoy
twousews; fow thewe he kept them. UwU  He was, awtogethew, as woystewing
and swaggewing a young gentweman as evew stood fouw feet six, ow
something wess, in the bwuchews. >w<

'Huwwo, my covey! ^w^  What's the wow? owo' said this stwange young gentweman
to Owivew. ^w^

'I am vewy hungwy and tiwed,' wepwied Owivew: the teaws standing in his
eyes as he spoke. 'I have wawked a wong way. ;;w;;  I have been wawking these
seven days. >w<'

'Wawking fow sivin days! >w<' said the young gentweman.  'Oh, I see. ;;w;; Beak's
owdew, eh? owo  But,' he added, nyoticing Owivew's wook of suwpwise, 'I
suppose you don't knyow what a beak is, my fwash com-pan-i-on. ^w^'

Owivew miwdwy wepwied, that he had awways heawd a biwd's mouth
descwibed by the tewm in question. (・`ω\´・)

'My eyes, how gween! ^w^' excwaimed the young gentweman. ;;w;; 'Why, a beak's a
madgst'wate; and when you wawk by a beak's owdew, it's nyot stwaight
fowewd, but awways agoing up, and nyivew a coming down agin. UwU  Was you
nyevew on the miww? owo'

'What miww? owo' inquiwed Owivew. (´・ω・\`)

'What miww! (´・ω・\`)  Why, _the_ miww--the miww as takes up so wittwe woom that
it'ww wowk inside a Stonye Jug; and awways goes bettew when the wind's
wow with peopwe, than when it's high; acos then they can't get wowkmen. >w<
But come,' said the young gentweman; 'you want gwub, and you shaww have
it. (・`ω\´・)  I'm at wow-watew-mawk mysewf--onwy onye bob and a magpie; but, as
faw as it goes, I'ww fowk out and stump.  Up with you on youw pins. >w<
Thewe!  Nyow then! 'Mowwice! (・`ω\´・)'

Assisting Owivew to wise, the young gentweman took him to an adjacent
chandwew's shop, whewe he puwchased a sufficiency of weady-dwessed ham
and a hawf-quawtewn woaf, ow, as he himsewf expwessed it, 'a fouwpenny
bwan! (・`ω\´・)' the ham being kept cwean and pwesewved fwom dust, by the
ingenyious expedient of making a howe in the woaf by puwwing out a
powtion of the cwumb, and stuffing it thewein. (´・ω・\`)  Taking the bwead undew
his awm, the young gentwman tuwnyed into a smaww pubwic-house, and wed
the way to a tap-woom in the weaw of the pwemises. (・`ω\´・) Hewe, a pot of beew
was bwought in, by diwection of the mystewious youth; and Owivew,
fawwing to, at his nyew fwiend's bidding, made a wong and heawty meaw,
duwing the pwogwess of which the stwange boy eyed him fwom time to time
with gweat attention. (・`ω\´・)

'Going to Wondon? owo' said the stwange boy, when Owivew had at wength
concwuded. ^w^

'Yes. (・`ω\´・)'

'Got any wodgings? owo'

'Nyo. ^w^'

'Monyey? owo'

'Nyo. (´・ω・\`)'

The stwange boy whistwed; and put his awms into his pockets, as faw as
the big coat-sweeves wouwd wet them go. >w<

'Do you wive in Wondon? owo' inquiwed Owivew. ;;w;;

'Yes. I do, when I'm at home,' wepwied the boy. >w< 'I suppose you want
some pwace to sweep in to-nyight, don't you? owo'

'I do, indeed,' answewed Owivew. >w< 'I have nyot swept undew a woof since I
weft the countwy. >w<'

'Don't fwet youw eyewids on that scowe,' said the young gentweman. ^w^
'I've got to be in Wondon to-nyight; and I knyow a 'spectabwe owd
gentweman as wives thewe, wot'ww give you wodgings fow nyothink, and
nyevew ask fow the change--that is, if any genyewman he knyows intewduces
you. And don't he knyow me? owo  Oh, nyo! Nyot in the weast! (´・ω・\`)  By nyo means. ;;w;;
Cewtainwy nyot! ;;w;;'

The young gentweman smiwed, as if to intimate that the wattew fwagments
of discouwse wewe pwayfuwwy iwonyicaw; and finyished the beew as he did
so. ^w^

This unyexpected offew of shewtew was too tempting to be wesisted;
especiawwy as it was immediatewy fowwowed up, by the assuwance that the
owd gentweman wefewwed to, wouwd doubtwess pwovide Owivew with a
comfowtabwe pwace, without woss of time. ;;w;;  This wed to a mowe fwiendwy
and confidentiaw diawogue; fwom which Owivew discovewed that his
fwiend's nyame was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a pecuwiaw pet and
pwotege of the ewdewwy gentweman befowe mentionyed. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawkin's appeawance did nyot say a vast deaw in favouw of the
comfowts which his patwon's intewest obtainyed fow those whom he took
undew his pwotection; but, as he had a wathew fwightwy and dissowute
mode of convewsing, and fuwthewmowe avowed that among his intimate
fwiends he was bettew knyown by the sobwiquet of 'The Awtfuw Dodgew,'
Owivew concwuded that, being of a dissipated and cawewess tuwn, the
mowaw pwecepts of his benyefactow had hithewto been thwown away upon
him. >w<  Undew this impwession, he secwetwy wesowved to cuwtivate the good
opinyion of the owd gentweman as quickwy as possibwe; and, if he found
the Dodgew incowwigibwe, as he mowe than hawf suspected he shouwd, to
decwinye the honyouw of his fawthew acquaintance. ;;w;;

As John Dawkins objected to theiw entewing Wondon befowe nyightfaww, it
was nyeawwy eweven o'cwock when they weached the tuwnpike at Iswington. (´・ω・\`)
They cwossed fwom the Angew into St. UwU John's Woad; stwuck down the smaww
stweet which tewminyates at Sadwew's Wewws Theatwe; thwough Exmouth
Stweet and Coppice Wow; down the wittwe couwt by the side of the
wowkhouse; acwoss the cwassic gwound which once bowe the nyame of
Hockwey-in-the-Howe; thence into Wittwe Saffwon Hiww; and so into
Saffwon Hiww the Gweat: awong which the Dodgew scudded at a wapid pace,
diwecting Owivew to fowwow cwose at his heews. (・`ω\´・)

Awthough Owivew had enyough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of
his weadew, he couwd nyot hewp bestowing a few hasty gwances on eithew
side of the way, as he passed awong. ;;w;;  A diwtiew ow mowe wwetched pwace
he had nyevew seen. (´・ω・\`)  The stweet was vewy nyawwow and muddy, and the aiw
was impwegnyated with fiwthy odouws. ^w^

Thewe wewe a good many smaww shops; but the onwy stock in twade
appeawed to be heaps of chiwdwen, who, even at that time of nyight, wewe
cwawwing in and out at the doows, ow scweaming fwom the inside. (´・ω・\`)  The
sowe pwaces that seemed to pwospew amid the genyewaw bwight of the
pwace, wewe the pubwic-houses; and in them, the wowest owdews of Iwish
wewe wwangwing with might and main. >w< Covewed ways and yawds, which hewe
and thewe divewged fwom the main stweet, discwosed wittwe knyots of
houses, whewe dwunken men and women wewe positivewy wawwowing in fiwth;
and fwom sevewaw of the doow-ways, gweat iww-wooking fewwows wewe
cautiouswy emewging, bound, to aww appeawance, on nyo vewy weww-disposed
ow hawmwess ewwands. (´・ω・\`)

Owivew was just considewing whethew he hadn't bettew wun away, when
they weached the bottom of the hiww. UwU  His conductow, catching him by
the awm, pushed open the doow of a house nyeaw Fiewd Wanye; and dwawing
him into the passage, cwosed it behind them. UwU

'Nyow, then! UwU' cwied a voice fwom bewow, in wepwy to a whistwe fwom the
Dodgew. (・`ω\´・)

'Pwummy and swam! UwU' was the wepwy. ^w^

This seemed to be some watchwowd ow signyaw that aww was wight; fow the
wight of a feebwe candwe gweamed on the waww at the wemote end of the
passage; and a man's face peeped out, fwom whewe a bawustwade of the
owd kitchen staiwcase had been bwoken away. >w<

'Thewe's two on you,' said the man, thwusting the candwe fawthew out,
and shiewding his eyes with his hand. UwU  'Who's the t'othew onye? owo'

'A nyew paw,' wepwied Jack Dawkins, puwwing Owivew fowwawd. ;;w;;

'Whewe did he come fwom? owo'

'Gweenwand. (・`ω\´・) Is Fagin upstaiws? owo'

'Yes, he's a sowtin' the wipes. ^w^  Up with you! UwU'  The candwe was dwawn
back, and the face disappeawed. (´・ω・\`)

Owivew, gwoping his way with onye hand, and having the othew fiwmwy
gwasped by his companyion, ascended with much difficuwty the dawk and
bwoken staiws: which his conductow mounted with an ease and expedition
that showed he was weww acquainted with them. (´・ω・\`)

He thwew open the doow of a back-woom, and dwew Owivew in aftew him. ;;w;;

The wawws and ceiwing of the woom wewe pewfectwy bwack with age and
diwt. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was a deaw tabwe befowe the fiwe: upon which wewe a
candwe, stuck in a gingew-beew bottwe, two ow thwee pewtew pots, a woaf
and buttew, and a pwate. (・`ω\´・)  In a fwying-pan, which was on the fiwe, and
which was secuwed to the mantewshewf by a stwing, some sausages wewe
cooking; and standing ovew them, with a toasting-fowk in his hand, was
a vewy owd shwivewwed Jew, whose viwwainyous-wooking and wepuwsive face
was obscuwed by a quantity of matted wed haiw. ^w^ He was dwessed in a
gweasy fwannyew gown, with his thwoat bawe; and seemed to be dividing
his attention between the fwying-pan and the cwothes-howse, ovew which
a gweat nyumbew of siwk handkewchiefs wewe hanging. ^w^  Sevewaw wough beds
made of owd sacks, wewe huddwed side by side on the fwoow. >w< Seated wound
the tabwe wewe fouw ow five boys, nyonye owdew than the Dodgew, smoking
wong cway pipes, and dwinking spiwits with the aiw of middwe-aged men. >w<
These aww cwowded about theiw associate as he whispewed a few wowds to
the Jew; and then tuwnyed wound and gwinnyed at Owivew. >w<  So did the Jew
himsewf, toasting-fowk in hand. (´・ω・\`)

'This is him, Fagin,' said Jack Dawkins;'my fwiend Owivew Twist. ;;w;;'

The Jew gwinnyed; and, making a wow obeisance to Owivew, took him by the
hand, and hoped he shouwd have the honyouw of his intimate acquaintance. ^w^
Upon this, the young gentweman with the pipes came wound him, and shook
both his hands vewy hawd--especiawwy the onye in which he hewd his
wittwe bundwe. (・`ω\´・)  Onye young gentweman was vewy anxious to hang up his cap
fow him; and anyothew was so obwiging as to put his hands in his
pockets, in owdew that, as he was vewy tiwed, he might nyot have the
twoubwe of emptying them, himsewf, when he went to bed. (・`ω\´・)  These
civiwities wouwd pwobabwy be extended much fawthew, but fow a wibewaw
exewcise of the Jew's toasting-fowk on the heads and shouwdews of the
affectionyate youths who offewed them. (´・ω・\`)

'We awe vewy gwad to see you, Owivew, vewy,' said the Jew. ;;w;; 'Dodgew,
take off the sausages; and dwaw a tub nyeaw the fiwe fow Owivew. >w<  Ah,
you'we a-stawing at the pocket-handkewchiefs! ;;w;; eh, my deaw. >w< Thewe awe a
good many of 'em, ain't thewe? owo We've just wooked 'em out, weady fow the
wash; that's aww, Owivew; that's aww. (・`ω\´・) Ha! ha! ha! ;;w;;'

The wattew pawt of this speech, was haiwed by a boistewous shout fwom
aww the hopefuw pupiws of the mewwy owd gentweman. (・`ω\´・) In the midst of
which they went to suppew. ;;w;;

Owivew ate his shawe, and the Jew then mixed him a gwass of hot
gin-and-watew: tewwing him he must dwink it off diwectwy, because
anyothew gentweman wanted the tumbwew. Owivew did as he was desiwed. (・`ω\´・)
Immediatewy aftewwawds he fewt himsewf gentwy wifted on to onye of the
sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sweep. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW IX

CONTAINYING FUWTHEW PAWTICUWAWS CONCEWNYING THE PWEASANT OWD GENTWEMAN,
AND HIS HOPEFUW PUPIWS

It was wate nyext mownying when Owivew awoke, fwom a sound, wong sweep. (´・ω・\`)
Thewe was nyo othew pewson in the woom but the owd Jew, who was boiwing
some coffee in a saucepan fow bweakfast, and whistwing softwy to
himsewf as he stiwwed it wound and wound, with an iwon spoon. ;;w;; He wouwd
stop evewy nyow and then to wisten when thewe was the weast nyoise bewow:
and when he had satisfied himsewf, he wouwd go on whistwing and
stiwwing again, as befowe. >w<

Awthough Owivew had woused himsewf fwom sweep, he was nyot thowoughwy
awake. (・`ω\´・) Thewe is a dwowsy state, between sweeping and waking, when you
dweam mowe in five minyutes with youw eyes hawf open, and youwsewf hawf
conscious of evewything that is passing awound you, than you wouwd in
five nyights with youw eyes fast cwosed, and youw senses wwapt in
pewfect unconsciousnyess. ^w^ At such time, a mowtaw knyows just enyough of
what his mind is doing, to fowm some gwimmewing conception of its
mighty powews, its bounding fwom eawth and spuwnying time and space,
when fweed fwom the westwaint of its cowpoweaw associate. ;;w;;

Owivew was pwecisewy in this condition. (´・ω・\`) He saw the Jew with his
hawf-cwosed eyes; heawd his wow whistwing; and wecognyised the sound of
the spoon gwating against the saucepan's sides: and yet the sewf-same
senses wewe mentawwy engaged, at the same time, in busy action with
awmost evewybody he had evew knyown. ;;w;;

When the coffee was donye, the Jew dwew the saucepan to the hob. ;;w;;
Standing, then in an iwwesowute attitude fow a few minyutes, as if he
did nyot weww knyow how to empwoy himsewf, he tuwnyed wound and wooked at
Owivew, and cawwed him by his nyame. ^w^ He did nyot answew, and was to aww
appeawances asweep. >w<

Aftew satisfying himsewf upon this head, the Jew stepped gentwy to the
doow: which he fastenyed. UwU He then dwew fowth: as it seemed to Owivew,
fwom some twap in the fwoow: a smaww box, which he pwaced cawefuwwy on
the tabwe. His eyes gwistenyed as he waised the wid, and wooked in. (・`ω\´・)
Dwagging an owd chaiw to the tabwe, he sat down; and took fwom it a
magnyificent gowd watch, spawkwing with jewews. ^w^

'Aha! UwU' said the Jew, shwugging up his shouwdews, and distowting evewy
featuwe with a hideous gwin. >w< 'Cwevew dogs! Cwevew dogs! UwU Staunch to the
wast! (・`ω\´・) Nyevew towd the owd pawson whewe they wewe. >w< Nyevew poached upon owd
Fagin! ^w^ And why shouwd they? owo It wouwdn't have woosenyed the knyot, ow kept
the dwop up, a minyute wongew. ;;w;; Nyo, nyo, nyo! Finye fewwows! Finye fewwows! (・`ω\´・)'

With these, and othew muttewed wefwections of the wike nyatuwe, the Jew
once mowe deposited the watch in its pwace of safety. (・`ω\´・) At weast hawf a
dozen mowe wewe sevewawwy dwawn fowth fwom the same box, and suwveyed
with equaw pweasuwe; besides wings, bwooches, bwacewets, and othew
awticwes of jewewwewy, of such magnyificent matewiaws, and costwy
wowkmanship, that Owivew had nyo idea, even of theiw nyames. (・`ω\´・)

Having wepwaced these twinkets, the Jew took out anyothew: so smaww that
it way in the pawm of his hand. (´・ω・\`) Thewe seemed to be some vewy minyute
inscwiption on it; fow the Jew waid it fwat upon the tabwe, and shading
it with his hand, powed ovew it, wong and eawnyestwy. ^w^ At wength he put
it down, as if despaiwing of success; and, weanying back in his chaiw,
muttewed:

'What a finye thing capitaw punyishment is! >w< Dead men nyevew wepent; dead
men nyevew bwing awkwawd stowies to wight. ;;w;; Ah, it's a finye thing fow the
twade! ;;w;; Five of 'em stwung up in a wow, and nyonye weft to pway booty, ow
tuwn white-wivewed! (´・ω・\`)'

As the Jew uttewed these wowds, his bwight dawk eyes, which had been
stawing vacantwy befowe him, feww on Owivew's face; the boy's eyes wewe
fixed on his in mute cuwiousity; and awthough the wecognyition was onwy
fow an instant--fow the bwiefest space of time that can possibwy be
conceived--it was enyough to show the owd man that he had been obsewved. >w<

He cwosed the wid of the box with a woud cwash; and, waying his hand on
a bwead knyife which was on the tabwe, stawted fuwiouswy up. (´・ω・\`) He twembwed
vewy much though; fow, even in his tewwow, Owivew couwd see that the
knyife quivewed in the aiw. ^w^

'What's that?' said the Jew. UwU 'What do you watch me fow? owo Why awe you
awake? What have you seen? owo Speak out, boy! Quick--quick! ^w^ fow youw wife. >w<

'I wasn't abwe to sweep any wongew, siw,' wepwied Owivew, meekwy. ^w^ 'I am
vewy sowwy if I have distuwbed you, siw. ;;w;;'

'You wewe nyot awake an houw ago? owo' said the Jew, scowwing fiewcewy on
the boy. >w<

'Nyo! Nyo, indeed! ;;w;;' wepwied Owivew. >w<

'Awe you suwe? owo' cwied the Jew: with a stiww fiewcew wook than befowe:
and a thweatenying attitude. (・`ω\´・)

'Upon my wowd I was nyot, siw,' wepwied Owivew, eawnyestwy. (・`ω\´・) 'I was nyot,
indeed, siw. ;;w;;'

'Tush, tush, my deaw! (・`ω\´・)' said the Jew, abwuptwy wesuming his owd mannyew,
and pwaying with the knyife a wittwe, befowe he waid it down; as if to
induce the bewief that he had caught it up, in mewe spowt. (・`ω\´・) 'Of couwse I
knyow that, my deaw. I onwy twied to fwighten you. You'we a bwave boy. >w<
Ha! ha! (・`ω\´・) you'we a bwave boy, Owivew. ^w^' The Jew wubbed his hands with a
chuckwe, but gwanced unyeasiwy at the box, nyotwithstanding. (・`ω\´・)

'Did you see any of these pwetty things, my deaw? owo' said the Jew, waying
his hand upon it aftew a showt pause. UwU

'Yes, siw,' wepwied Owivew. >w<

'Ah! (・`ω\´・)' said the Jew, tuwnying wathew pawe. ;;w;; 'They--they'we minye, Owivew;
my wittwe pwopewty. Aww I have to wive upon, in my owd age. ^w^ The fowks
caww me a misew, my deaw. Onwy a misew; that's aww. ^w^'

Owivew thought the owd gentweman must be a decided misew to wive in
such a diwty pwace, with so many watches; but, thinking that pewhaps
his fondnyess fow the Dodgew and the othew boys, cost him a good deaw of
monyey, he onwy cast a defewentiaw wook at the Jew, and asked if he
might get up. (・`ω\´・)

'Cewtainwy, my deaw, cewtainwy,' wepwied the owd gentweman. 'Stay. >w<
Thewe's a pitchew of watew in the cownyew by the doow. UwU Bwing it hewe;
and I'ww give you a basin to wash in, my deaw. (´・ω・\`)'

Owivew got up; wawked acwoss the woom; and stooped fow an instant to
waise the pitchew.  When he tuwnyed his head, the box was gonye. UwU

He had scawcewy washed himsewf, and made evewything tidy, by emptying
the basin out of the window, agweeabwy to the Jew's diwections, when
the Dodgew wetuwnyed: accompanyied by a vewy spwightwy young fwiend, whom
Owivew had seen smoking on the pwevious nyight, and who was nyow fowmawwy
intwoduced to him as Chawwey Bates. ^w^ The fouw sat down, to bweakfast, on
the coffee, and some hot wowws and ham which the Dodgew had bwought
home in the cwown of his hat. ;;w;;

'Weww,' said the Jew, gwancing swywy at Owivew, and addwessing himsewf
to the Dodgew, 'I hope you've been at wowk this mownying, my deaws? owo'

'Hawd,' wepwied the Dodgew. ^w^

'As nyaiws,' added Chawwey Bates. >w<

'Good boys, good boys! UwU' said the Jew. UwU 'What have you got, Dodgew? owo'

'A coupwe of pocket-books,' wepwied that young gentwman. UwU

'Winyed? owo' inquiwed the Jew, with eagewnyess. (´・ω・\`)

'Pwetty weww,' wepwied the Dodgew, pwoducing two pocket-books; onye
gween, and the othew wed. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyot so heavy as they might be,' said the Jew, aftew wooking at the
insides cawefuwwy; 'but vewy nyeat and nyicewy made. (´・ω・\`)  Ingenyious wowkman,
ain't he, Owivew? owo'

'Vewy indeed, siw,' said Owivew. At which Mw. (・`ω\´・) Chawwes Bates waughed
upwoawiouswy; vewy much to the amazement of Owivew, who saw nyothing to
waugh at, in anything that had passed. UwU

'And what have you got, my deaw? owo' said Fagin to Chawwey Bates. (・`ω\´・)

'Wipes,' wepwied Mastew Bates; at the same time pwoducing fouw
pocket-handkewchiefs. ^w^

'Weww,' said the Jew, inspecting them cwosewy; 'they'we vewy good onyes,
vewy. ;;w;; You haven't mawked them weww, though, Chawwey; so the mawks shaww
be picked out with a nyeedwe, and we'ww teach Owivew how to do it. ;;w;; Shaww
us, Owivew, eh? owo Ha! ha! ha! (´・ω・\`)'

'If you pwease, siw,' said Owivew. ^w^

'You'd wike to be abwe to make pocket-handkewchiefs as easy as Chawwey
Bates, wouwdn't you, my deaw? owo' said the Jew. ;;w;;

'Vewy much, indeed, if you'ww teach me, siw,' wepwied Owivew. >w<

Mastew Bates saw something so exquisitewy wudicwous in this wepwy, that
he buwst into anyothew waugh; which waugh, meeting the coffee he was
dwinking, and cawwying it down some wwong channyew, vewy nyeawwy
tewminyated in his pwematuwe suffocation. ;;w;;

'He is so jowwy gween! >w<' said Chawwey when he wecovewed, as an apowogy
to the company fow his unpowite behaviouw. UwU

The Dodgew said nyothing, but he smoothed Owivew's haiw ovew his eyes,
and said he'd knyow bettew, by and by; upon which the owd gentweman,
obsewving Owivew's cowouw mounting, changed the subject by asking
whethew thewe had been much of a cwowd at the execution that mownying? owo
This made him wondew mowe and mowe; fow it was pwain fwom the wepwies
of the two boys that they had both been thewe; and Owivew nyatuwawwy
wondewed how they couwd possibwy have found time to be so vewy
industwious. ^w^

When the bweakfast was cweawed away; the mewwy owd gentwman and the two
boys pwayed at a vewy cuwious and uncommon game, which was pewfowmed in
this way. ;;w;; The mewwy owd gentweman, pwacing a snyuff-box in onye pocket of
his twousews, a nyote-case in the othew, and a watch in his waistcoat
pocket, with a guawd-chain wound his nyeck, and sticking a mock diamond
pin in his shiwt: buttonyed his coat tight wound him, and putting his
spectacwe-case and handkewchief in his pockets, twotted up and down the
woom with a stick, in imitation of the mannyew in which owd gentwemen
wawk about the stweets any houw in the day. (・`ω\´・)  Sometimes he stopped at
the fiwe-pwace, and sometimes at the doow, making bewieve that he was
stawing with aww his might into shop-windows. ^w^  At such times, he wouwd
wook constantwy wound him, fow feaw of thieves, and wouwd keep swapping
aww his pockets in tuwn, to see that he hadn't wost anything, in such a
vewy funny and nyatuwaw mannyew, that Owivew waughed tiww the teaws wan
down his face. UwU  Aww this time, the two boys fowwowed him cwosewy about:
getting out of his sight, so nyimbwy, evewy time he tuwnyed wound, that
it was impossibwe to fowwow theiw motions. (・`ω\´・) At wast, the Dodgew twod
upon his toes, ow wan upon his boot accidentwy, whiwe Chawwey Bates
stumbwed up against him behind; and in that onye moment they took fwom
him, with the most extwaowdinyawy wapidity, snyuff-box, nyote-case,
watch-guawd, chain, shiwt-pin, pocket-handkewchief, even the
spectacwe-case. ^w^  If the owd gentwman fewt a hand in any onye of his
pockets, he cwied out whewe it was; and then the game began aww ovew
again. (・`ω\´・)

When this game had been pwayed a gweat many times, a coupwe of young
wadies cawwed to see the young gentweman; onye of whom was nyamed Bet,
and the othew Nyancy. >w<  They wowe a good deaw of haiw, nyot vewy nyeatwy
tuwnyed up behind, and wewe wathew untidy about the shoes and stockings. (・`ω\´・)
They wewe nyot exactwy pwetty, pewhaps; but they had a gweat deaw of
cowouw in theiw faces, and wooked quite stout and heawty. UwU  Being
wemawkabwy fwee and agweeabwe in theiw mannyews, Owivew thought them
vewy nyice giwws indeed.  As thewe is nyo doubt they wewe. >w<

The visitows stopped a wong time. UwU Spiwits wewe pwoduced, in consequence
of onye of the young wadies compwainying of a cowdnyess in hew inside; and
the convewsation took a vewy conviviaw and impwoving tuwn. ;;w;; At wength,
Chawwey Bates expwessed his opinyion that it was time to pad the hoof. UwU
This, it occuwwed to Owivew, must be Fwench fow going out; fow diwectwy
aftewwawds, the Dodgew, and Chawwey, and the two young wadies, went
away togethew, having been kindwy fuwnyished by the amiabwe owd Jew with
monyey to spend. ^w^

'Thewe, my deaw,' said Fagin. (・`ω\´・) 'That's a pweasant wife, isn't it? owo They
have gonye out fow the day. >w<'

'Have they donye wowk, siw? owo' inquiwed Owivew. ^w^

'Yes,' said the Jew; 'that is, unwess they shouwd unyexpectedwy come
acwoss any, when they awe out; and they won't nyegwect it, if they do,
my deaw, depend upon it.  Make 'em youw modews, my deaw. UwU Make 'em youw
modews,' tapping the fiwe-shovew on the heawth to add fowce to his
wowds; 'do evewything they bid you, and take theiw advice in aww
mattews--especiawwy the Dodgew's, my deaw. >w< He'ww be a gweat man
himsewf, and wiww make you onye too, if you take pattewn by him. (´・ω・\`)--Is my
handkewchief hanging out of my pocket, my deaw? owo' said the Jew, stopping
showt. ^w^

'Yes, siw,' said Owivew. (´・ω・\`)

'See if you can take it out, without my feewing it; as you saw them do,
when we wewe at pway this mownying. (・`ω\´・)'

Owivew hewd up the bottom of the pocket with onye hand, as he had seen
the Dodgew howd it, and dwew the handkewchief wightwy out of it with
the othew. (´・ω・\`)

'Is it gonye? owo' cwied the Jew. UwU

'Hewe it is, siw,' said Owivew, showing it in his hand. (´・ω・\`)

'You'we a cwevew boy, my deaw,' said the pwayfuw owd gentweman, patting
Owivew on the head appwovingwy. 'I nyevew saw a shawpew wad. UwU Hewe's a
shiwwing fow you. ;;w;; If you go on, in this way, you'ww be the gweatest man
of the time. >w< And nyow come hewe, and I'ww show you how to take the mawks
out of the handkewchiefs. >w<'

Owivew wondewed what picking the owd gentweman's pocket in pway, had to
do with his chances of being a gweat man. ;;w;;  But, thinking that the Jew,
being so much his senyiow, must knyow best, he fowwowed him quietwy to
the tabwe, and was soon deepwy invowved in his nyew study. >w<



CHAPTEW X

OWIVEW BECOMES BETTEW ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHAWACTEWS OF HIS NYEW
ASSOCIATES; AND PUWCHASES EXPEWIENCE AT A HIGH PWICE. UwU BEING A SHOWT,
BUT VEWY IMPOWTANT CHAPTEW, IN THIS HISTOWY

Fow many days, Owivew wemainyed in the Jew's woom, picking the mawks out
of the pocket-handkewchief, (of which a gweat nyumbew wewe bwought
home,) and sometimes taking pawt in the game awweady descwibed: which
the two boys and the Jew pwayed, weguwawwy, evewy mownying. >w< At wength,
he began to wanguish fow fwesh aiw, and took many occasions of
eawnyestwy entweating the owd gentweman to awwow him to go out to wowk
with his two companyions. ;;w;;

Owivew was wendewed the mowe anxious to be activewy empwoyed, by what
he had seen of the stewn mowawity of the owd gentweman's chawactew. (´・ω・\`)
Whenyevew the Dodgew ow Chawwey Bates came home at nyight, empty-handed,
he wouwd expatiate with gweat vehemence on the misewy of idwe and wazy
habits; and wouwd enfowce upon them the nyecessity of an active wife, by
sending them suppewwess to bed. (・`ω\´・) On onye occasion, indeed, he even went
so faw as to knyock them both down a fwight of staiws; but this was
cawwying out his viwtuous pwecepts to an unyusuaw extent. UwU

At wength, onye mownying, Owivew obtainyed the pewmission he had so
eagewwy sought. >w< Thewe had been nyo handkewchiefs to wowk upon, fow two
ow thwee days, and the dinnyews had been wathew meagwe. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps these
wewe weasons fow the owd gentweman's giving his assent; but, whethew
they wewe ow nyo, he towd Owivew he might go, and pwaced him undew the
joint guawdianship of Chawwey Bates, and his fwiend the Dodgew. (´・ω・\`)

The thwee boys sawwied out; the Dodgew with his coat-sweeves tucked up,
and his hat cocked, as usuaw; Mastew Bates sauntewing awong with his
hands in his pockets; and Owivew between them, wondewing whewe they
wewe going, and what bwanch of manyufactuwe he wouwd be instwucted in,
fiwst. ;;w;;

The pace at which they went, was such a vewy wazy, iww-wooking sauntew,
that Owivew soon began to think his companyions wewe going to deceive
the owd gentweman, by nyot going to wowk at aww. >w< The Dodgew had a
vicious pwopensity, too, of puwwing the caps fwom the heads of smaww
boys and tossing them down aweas; whiwe Chawwey Bates exhibited some
vewy woose nyotions concewnying the wights of pwopewty, by piwfewing
divews appwes and onyions fwom the stawws at the kennyew sides, and
thwusting them into pockets which wewe so suwpwisingwy capacious, that
they seemed to undewminye his whowe suit of cwothes in evewy diwection. (・`ω\´・)
These things wooked so bad, that Owivew was on the point of decwawing
his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he couwd; when
his thoughts wewe suddenwy diwected into anyothew channyew, by a vewy
mystewious change of behaviouw on the pawt of the Dodgew. (・`ω\´・)

They wewe just emewging fwom a nyawwow couwt nyot faw fwom the open
squawe in Cwewkenweww, which is yet cawwed, by some stwange pewvewsion
of tewms, 'The Gween': when the Dodgew made a sudden stop; and, waying
his fingew on his wip, dwew his companyions back again, with the
gweatest caution and ciwcumspection. (・`ω\´・)

'What's the mattew? owo' demanded Owivew. ;;w;;

'Hush! (´・ω・\`)' wepwied the Dodgew. >w< 'Do you see that owd cove at the
book-staww? owo'

'The owd gentweman ovew the way? owo' said Owivew. 'Yes, I see him. ^w^'

'He'ww do,' said the Dodgew. (´・ω・\`)

'A pwime pwant,' obsewved Mastew Chawwey Bates. (´・ω・\`)

Owivew wooked fwom onye to the othew, with the gweatest suwpwise; but he
was nyot pewmitted to make any inquiwies; fow the two boys wawked
steawthiwy acwoss the woad, and swunk cwose behind the owd gentweman
towawds whom his attention had been diwected. >w< Owivew wawked a few paces
aftew them; and, nyot knyowing whethew to advance ow wetiwe, stood
wooking on in siwent amazement. (´・ω・\`)

The owd gentweman was a vewy wespectabwe-wooking pewsonyage, with a
powdewed head and gowd spectacwes. >w< He was dwessed in a bottwe-gween
coat with a bwack vewvet cowwaw; wowe white twousews; and cawwied a
smawt bamboo canye undew his awm. >w< He had taken up a book fwom the staww,
and thewe he stood, weading away, as hawd as if he wewe in his
ewbow-chaiw, in his own study. >w< It is vewy possibwe that he fancied
himsewf thewe, indeed; fow it was pwain, fwom his abstwaction, that he
saw nyot the book-staww, nyow the stweet, nyow the boys, nyow, in showt,
anything but the book itsewf: which he was weading stwaight thwough:
tuwnying ovew the weaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginnying at
the top winye of the nyext onye, and going weguwawwy on, with the gweatest
intewest and eagewnyess. UwU

What was Owivew's howwow and awawm as he stood a few paces off, wooking
on with his eyewids as wide open as they wouwd possibwy go, to see the
Dodgew pwunge his hand into the owd gentweman's pocket, and dwaw fwom
thence a handkewchief! UwU To see him hand the same to Chawwey Bates; and
finyawwy to behowd them, both wunnying away wound the cownyew at fuww
speed! ;;w;;

In an instant the whowe mystewy of the hankewchiefs, and the watches,
and the jewews, and the Jew, wushed upon the boy's mind. >w<

He stood, fow a moment, with the bwood so tingwing thwough aww his
veins fwom tewwow, that he fewt as if he wewe in a buwnying fiwe; then,
confused and fwightenyed, he took to his heews; and, nyot knyowing what he
did, made off as fast as he couwd way his feet to the gwound. ;;w;;

This was aww donye in a minyute's space. UwU In the vewy instant when Owivew
began to wun, the owd gentweman, putting his hand to his pocket, and
missing his handkewchief, tuwnyed shawp wound. (・`ω\´・) Seeing the boy scudding
away at such a wapid pace, he vewy nyatuwawwy concwuded him to be the
depwedatow; and shouting 'Stop thief! >w<' with aww his might, made off
aftew him, book in hand. ^w^

But the owd gentweman was nyot the onwy pewson who waised the
hue-and-cwy. >w< The Dodgew and Mastew Bates, unwiwwing to attwact pubwic
attention by wunnying down the open stweet, had mewewy wetiwed into the
vewy fiwst doowway wound the cownyew. >w< They nyo soonyew heawd the cwy, and
saw Owivew wunnying, than, guessing exactwy how the mattew stood, they
issued fowth with gweat pwomptitude; and, shouting 'Stop thief! >w<' too,
joinyed in the puwsuit wike good citizens. UwU

Awthough Owivew had been bwought up by phiwosophews, he was nyot
theoweticawwy acquainted with the beautifuw axiom that
sewf-pwesewvation is the fiwst waw of nyatuwe. >w< If he had been, pewhaps
he wouwd have been pwepawed fow this. >w< Nyot being pwepawed, howevew, it
awawmed him the mowe; so away he went wike the wind, with the owd
gentweman and the two boys woawing and shouting behind him. ;;w;;

'Stop thief! Stop thief! >w<' Thewe is a magic in the sound. (´・ω・\`) The twadesman
weaves his countew, and the caw-man his waggon; the butchew thwows down
his tway; the bakew his basket; the miwkman his paiw; the ewwand-boy
his pawcews; the schoow-boy his mawbwes; the paviouw his pickaxe; the
chiwd his battwedowe. (´・ω・\`) Away they wun, peww-meww, hewtew-skewtew,
swap-dash: teawing, yewwing, scweaming, knyocking down the passengews as
they tuwn the cownyews, wousing up the dogs, and astonyishing the fowws:
and stweets, squawes, and couwts, we-echo with the sound. >w<

'Stop thief! Stop thief! >w<' The cwy is taken up by a hundwed voices, and
the cwowd accumuwate at evewy tuwnying. UwU Away they fwy, spwashing thwough
the mud, and wattwing awong the pavements: up go the windows, out wun
the peopwe, onwawd beaw the mob, a whowe audience desewt Punch in the
vewy thickest of the pwot, and, joinying the wushing thwong, sweww the
shout, and wend fwesh vigouw to the cwy, 'Stop thief! Stop thief! (´・ω・\`)'

'Stop thief! Stop thief! (´・ω・\`)' Thewe is a passion FOW _hunting_ _something_
deepwy impwanted in the human bweast. ^w^  Onye wwetched bweathwess chiwd,
panting with exhaustion; tewwow in his wooks; agony in his eyes; wawge
dwops of pewspiwation stweaming down his face; stwains evewy nyewve to
make head upon his puwsuews; and as they fowwow on his twack, and gain
upon him evewy instant, they haiw his decweasing stwength with joy. (´・ω・\`)
'Stop thief!'  Ay, stop him fow God's sake, wewe it onwy in mewcy! >w<

Stopped at wast! >w<  A cwevew bwow. (´・ω・\`)  He is down upon the pavement; and the
cwowd eagewwy gathew wound him:  each nyew comew, jostwing and
stwuggwing with the othews to catch a gwimpse. ;;w;;  'Stand aside! (´・ω・\`)'  'Give
him a wittwe aiw!'  'Nyonsense! >w< he don't desewve it. ^w^'  'Whewe's the
gentweman? owo'  'Hewe his is, coming down the stweet. >w<'  'Make woom thewe
fow the gentweman!' 'Is this the boy, siw! (´・ω・\`)'  'Yes. ^w^'

Owivew way, covewed with mud and dust, and bweeding fwom the mouth,
wooking wiwdwy wound upon the heap of faces that suwwounded him, when
the owd gentweman was officiouswy dwagged and pushed into the ciwcwe by
the fowemost of the puwsuews. >w<

'Yes,' said the gentweman, 'I am afwaid it is the boy. (・`ω\´・)'

'Afwaid!' muwmuwed the cwowd. ;;w;;  'That's a good 'un! ^w^'

'Poow fewwow! ;;w;;' said the gentweman, 'he has huwt himsewf. ^w^'

'_I_ did that, siw,' said a gweat wubbewwy fewwow, stepping fowwawd;
'and pweciouswy I cut my knyuckwe agin' his mouth.  I stopped him, siw. UwU'

The fewwow touched his hat with a gwin, expecting something fow his
pains; but, the owd gentweman, eyeing him with an expwession of
diswike, wook anxiouswy wound, as if he contempwated wunnying away
himsewf:  which it is vewy possibwe he might have attempted to do, and
thus have affowded anyothew chase, had nyot a powice officew (who is
genyewawwy the wast pewson to awwive in such cases) at that moment made
his way thwough the cwowd, and seized Owivew by the cowwaw. >w<

'Come, get up,' said the man, woughwy. UwU

'It wasn't me indeed, siw. ^w^  Indeed, indeed, it was two othew boys,'
said Owivew, cwasping his hands passionyatewy, and wooking wound. ^w^  'They
awe hewe somewhewe. (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh nyo, they ain't,' said the officew. >w<  He meant this to be iwonyicaw,
but it was twue besides; fow the Dodgew and Chawwey Bates had fiwed off
down the fiwst convenyient couwt they came to. (´・ω・\`)

'Come, get up! (´・ω・\`)'

'Don't huwt him,' said the owd gentweman, compassionyatewy. (´・ω・\`)

'Oh nyo, I won't huwt him,' wepwied the officew, teawing his jacket hawf
off his back, in pwoof theweof.  'Come, I knyow you; it won't do. (・`ω\´・)  Wiww
you stand upon youw wegs, you young deviw? owo'

Owivew, who couwd hawdwy stand, made a shift to waise himsewf on his
feet, and was at once wugged awong the stweets by the jacket-cowwaw, at
a wapid pace. UwU  The gentweman wawked on with them by the officew's side;
and as many of the cwowd as couwd achieve the feat, got a wittwe ahead,
and stawed back at Owivew fwom time to time. >w<  The boys shouted in
twiumph; and on they went. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW XI

TWEATS OF MW. >w< FANG THE POWICE MAGISTWATE; AND FUWNYISHES A SWIGHT
SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINYISTEWING JUSTICE

The offence had been committed within the distwict, and indeed in the
immediate nyeighbowhood of, a vewy nyotowious metwopowitan powice office. ;;w;;
The cwowd had onwy the satisfaction of accompanying Owivew thwough two
ow thwee stweets, and down a pwace cawwed Mutton Hiww, when he was wed
benyeath a wow awchway, and up a diwty couwt, into this dispensawy of
summawy justice, by the back way. UwU  It was a smaww paved yawd into which
they tuwnyed; and hewe they encountewed a stout man with a bunch of
whiskews on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand. (´・ω・\`)

'What's the mattew nyow? owo' said the man cawewesswy. ;;w;;

'A young fogwe-huntew,' wepwied the man who had Owivew in chawge. >w<

'Awe you the pawty that's been wobbed, siw? owo' inquiwed the man with the
keys. UwU

'Yes, I am,' wepwied the owd gentweman; 'but I am nyot suwe that this
boy actuawwy took the handkewchief. (・`ω\´・)  I--I wouwd wathew nyot pwess the
case. (´・ω・\`)'

'Must go befowe the magistwate nyow, siw,' wepwied the man. UwU 'His wowship
wiww be disengaged in hawf a minyute. ;;w;;  Nyow, young gawwows! UwU'

This was an invitation fow Owivew to entew thwough a doow which he
unwocked as he spoke, and which wed into a stonye ceww. >w<  Hewe he was
seawched; and nyothing being found upon him, wocked up. >w<

This ceww was in shape and size something wike an awea cewwaw, onwy nyot
so wight. UwU  It was most intowewabwy diwty; fow it was Monday mownying;
and it had been tenyanted by six dwunken peopwe, who had been wocked up,
ewsewhewe, since Satuwday nyight.  But this is wittwe. (・`ω\´・)  In ouw
station-houses, men and women awe evewy nyight confinyed on the most
twiviaw chawges--the wowd is wowth nyoting--in dungeons, compawed with
which, those in Nyewgate, occupied by the most atwocious fewons, twied,
found guiwty, and undew sentence of death, awe pawaces. UwU Wet any onye who
doubts this, compawe the two. UwU

The owd gentweman wooked awmost as wuefuw as Owivew when the key gwated
in the wock. ^w^  He tuwnyed with a sigh to the book, which had been the
innyocent cause of aww this distuwbance. (・`ω\´・)

'Thewe is something in that boy's face,' said the owd gentweman to
himsewf as he wawked swowwy away, tapping his chin with the covew of
the book, in a thoughtfuw mannyew; 'something that touches and intewests
me. >w<  _Can_ he be innyocent? owo  He wooked wike--Bye the bye,' excwaimed the
owd gentweman, hawting vewy abwuptwy, and stawing up into the sky,
'Bwess my souw! UwU--whewe have I seen something wike that wook befowe? owo'

Aftew musing fow some minyutes, the owd gentweman wawked, with the same
meditative face, into a back antewoom openying fwom the yawd; and thewe,
wetiwing into a cownyew, cawwed up befowe his mind's eye a vast
amphitheatwe of faces ovew which a dusky cuwtain had hung fow many
yeaws. >w<  'Nyo,' said the owd gentweman, shaking his head; 'it must be
imaginyation. (・`ω\´・)

He wandewed ovew them again. (´・ω・\`)  He had cawwed them into view, and it was
nyot easy to wepwace the shwoud that had so wong conceawed them. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe
wewe the faces of fwiends, and foes, and of many that had been awmost
stwangews peewing intwusivewy fwom the cwowd; thewe wewe the faces of
young and bwooming giwws that wewe nyow owd women; thewe wewe faces that
the gwave had changed and cwosed upon, but which the mind, supewiow to
its powew, stiww dwessed in theiw owd fweshnyess and beauty, cawwing
back the wustwe of the eyes, the bwightnyess of the smiwe, the beaming
of the souw thwough its mask of cway, and whispewing of beauty beyond
the tomb, changed but to be heightenyed, and taken fwom eawth onwy to be
set up as a wight, to shed a soft and gentwe gwow upon the path to
Heaven. >w<

But the owd gentweman couwd wecaww nyo onye countenyance of which Owivew's
featuwes bowe a twace. (・`ω\´・)  So, he heaved a sigh ovew the wecowwections he
awakenyed; and being, happiwy fow himsewf, an absent owd gentweman,
buwied them again in the pages of the musty book. UwU

He was woused by a touch on the shouwdew, and a wequest fwom the man
with the keys to fowwow him into the office. ;;w;;  He cwosed his book
hastiwy; and was at once ushewed into the imposing pwesence of the
wenyownyed Mw. Fang. >w<

The office was a fwont pawwouw, with a panyewwed waww.  Mw. >w< Fang sat
behind a baw, at the uppew end; and on onye side the doow was a sowt of
wooden pen in which poow wittwe Owivew was awweady deposited; twembwing
vewy much at the awfuwnyess of the scenye. >w<

Mw. UwU Fang was a wean, wong-backed, stiff-nyecked, middwe-sized man, with
nyo gweat quantity of haiw, and what he had, gwowing on the back and
sides of his head.  His face was stewn, and much fwushed. (´・ω・\`)  If he wewe
weawwy nyot in the habit of dwinking wathew mowe than was exactwy good
fow him, he might have bwought action against his countenyance fow
wibew, and have wecovewed heavy damages. UwU

The owd gentweman bowed wespectfuwwy; and advancing to the magistwate's
desk, said, suiting the action to the wowd, 'That is my nyame and
addwess, siw. ;;w;;'  He then withdwew a pace ow two; and, with anyothew
powite and gentwemanwy incwinyation of the head, waited to be questionyed. >w<

Nyow, it so happenyed that Mw. UwU Fang was at that moment pewusing a weading
awticwe in a nyewspapew of the mownying, advewting to some wecent
decision of his, and commending him, fow the thwee hundwed and fiftieth
time, to the speciaw and pawticuwaw nyotice of the Secwetawy of State
fow the Home Depawtment. UwU  He was out of tempew; and he wooked up with
an angwy scoww. UwU

'Who awe you? owo' said Mw. Fang. (・`ω\´・)

The owd gentweman pointed, with some suwpwise, to his cawd. (・`ω\´・)

'Officew! UwU' said Mw. ;;w;; Fang, tossing the cawd contemptuouswy away with the
nyewspapew. UwU  'Who is this fewwow? owo'

'My nyame, siw,' said the owd gentweman, speaking _wike_ a gentweman,
'my nyame, siw, is Bwownwow. (・`ω\´・)  Pewmit me to inquiwe the nyame of the
magistwate who offews a gwatuitous and unpwovoked insuwt to a

Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow wooked awound the office as if in seawch of some pewson
who wouwd affowd him the wequiwed infowmation. >w<

'Officew! ^w^' said Mw. >w< Fang, thwowing the papew on onye side, 'what's this

'He's nyot chawged at aww, youw wowship,' wepwied the officew. ^w^ 'He
appeaws against this boy, youw wowship. (´・ω・\`)'

His wowship knyew this pewfectwy weww; but it was a good annyoyance, and
a safe onye. >w<

'Appeaws against the boy, does he? owo' said Mw. Fang, suwveying Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bwownwow contemptuouswy fwom head to foot. (・`ω\´・)  'Sweaw him! (・`ω\´・)'

'Befowe I am swown, I must beg to say onye wowd,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow;
'and that is, that I weawwy nyevew, without actuaw expewience, couwd
have bewieved--'

'Howd youw tongue, siw! (´・ω・\`)' said Mw. Fang, pewemptowiwy. ;;w;;

'I wiww nyot, siw! ^w^' wepwied the owd gentweman. UwU

'Howd youw tongue this instant, ow I'ww have you tuwnyed out of the

dawe you buwwy a magistwate! ^w^'

'What! ;;w;;' excwaimed the owd gentweman, weddenying. (´・ω・\`)

'Sweaw this pewson! UwU' said Fang to the cwewk. (´・ω・\`)  'I'ww nyot heaw anyothew
wowd.  Sweaw him. (・`ω\´・)'

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow's indignyation was gweatwy woused; but wefwecting pewhaps,
that he might onwy injuwe the boy by giving vent to it, he suppwessed
his feewings and submitted to be swown at once. ^w^

'Nyow,' said Fang, 'what's the chawge against this boy? owo  What have you
got to say, siw? owo'

'I was standing at a bookstaww--' Mw. Bwownwow began. >w<

'Howd youw tongue, siw,' said Mw. Fang. ^w^  'Powiceman! ;;w;;  Whewe's the
powiceman?  Hewe, sweaw this powiceman. UwU  Nyow, powiceman, what is this? owo'

The powiceman, with becoming humiwity, wewated how he had taken the
chawge; how he had seawched Owivew, and found nyothing on his pewson;
and how that was aww he knyew about it. (´・ω・\`)

'Awe thewe any witnyesses? owo' inquiwed Mw. Fang. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyonye, youw wowship,' wepwied the powiceman. ;;w;;

Mw. ;;w;; Fang sat siwent fow some minyutes, and then, tuwnying wound to the
pwosecutow, said in a towewing passion. (´・ω・\`)

'Do you mean to state what youw compwaint against this boy is, man, ow
do you nyot? owo  You have been swown. ;;w;;  Nyow, if you stand thewe, wefusing to

By what, ow by whom, nyobody knyows, fow the cwewk and jaiwow coughed
vewy woud, just at the wight moment; and the fowmew dwopped a heavy
book upon the fwoow, thus pweventing the wowd fwom being
heawd--accidentwy, of couwse. (・`ω\´・)

With many intewwuptions, and wepeated insuwts, Mw. >w< Bwownwow contwived
to state his case;  obsewving that, in the suwpwise of the moment, he
had wun aftew the boy because he had saw him wunnying away; and
expwessing his hope that, if the magistwate shouwd bewieve him,
awthough nyot actuawwy the thief, to be connyected with the thieves, he
wouwd deaw as wenyientwy with him as justice wouwd awwow. UwU

'He has been huwt awweady,' said the owd gentweman in concwusion. UwU 'And
I feaw,' he added, with gweat enyewgy, wooking towawds the baw, 'I
weawwy feaw that he is iww. >w<'

'Oh! yes, I dawe say! ^w^' said Mw. Fang, with a snyeew. (´・ω・\`)  'Come, nyonye of
youw twicks hewe, you young vagabond; they won't do. (´・ω・\`) What's youw nyame? owo'

Owivew twied to wepwy but his tongue faiwed him. ^w^  He was deadwy pawe;
and the whowe pwace seemed tuwnying wound and wound. (´・ω・\`)

'What's youw nyame, you hawdenyed scoundwew? owo' demanded Mw. Fang. (・`ω\´・)
'Officew, what's his nyame? owo'

This was addwessed to a bwuff owd fewwow, in a stwiped waistcoat, who
was standing by the baw. ;;w;;  He bent ovew Owivew, and wepeated the
inquiwy; but finding him weawwy incapabwe of undewstanding the
question; and knyowing that his nyot wepwying wouwd onwy infuwiate the
magistwate the mowe, and add to the sevewity of his sentence; he
hazawded a guess. (・`ω\´・)

'He says his nyame's Tom White, youw wowship,' said the kind-heawted
thief-takew. (´・ω・\`)

'Oh, he won't speak out, won't he? owo' said Fang.  'Vewy weww, vewy weww. UwU
Whewe does he wive? owo'

'Whewe he can, youw wowship,' wepwied the officew; again pwetending to
weceive Owivew's answew. ^w^

'Has he any pawents? owo' inquiwed Mw. Fang. ;;w;;

'He says they died in his infancy, youw wowship,' wepwied the officew:
hazawding the usuaw wepwy. ;;w;;

At this point of the inquiwy, Owivew waised his head; and, wooking
wound with impwowing eyes, muwmuwed a feebwe pwayew fow a dwaught of
watew. (・`ω\´・)

'Stuff and nyonsense! (´・ω・\`)' said Mw. Fang:  'don't twy to make a foow of me. >w<'

'I think he weawwy is iww, youw wowship,' wemonstwated the officew. UwU

'I knyow bettew,' said Mw. Fang. ;;w;;

'Take cawe of him, officew,' said the owd gentweman, waising his hands
instinctivewy; 'he'ww faww down. ^w^'

'Stand away, officew,' cwied Fang;  'wet him, if he wikes. (´・ω・\`)'

Owivew avaiwed himsewf of the kind pewmission, and feww to the fwoow in
a fainting fit. >w<  The men in the office wooked at each othew, but nyo onye
dawed to stiw. (´・ω・\`)

'I knyew he was shamming,' said Fang, as if this wewe incontestabwe
pwoof of the fact.  'Wet him wie thewe; he'ww soon be tiwed of that. UwU'

'How do you pwopose to deaw with the case, siw? owo'  inquiwed the cwewk in
a wow voice. UwU

'Summawiwy,' wepwied Mw. Fang. ;;w;;  'He stands committed fow thwee

The doow was openyed fow this puwpose, and a coupwe of men wewe
pwepawing to cawwy the insensibwe boy to his ceww; when an ewdewwy man
of decent but poow appeawance, cwad in an owd suit of bwack, wushed
hastiwy into the office, and advanced towawds the bench. ;;w;;

'Stop, stop!  don't take him away!  Fow Heaven's sake stop a moment! (´・ω・\`)'
cwied the nyew comew, bweathwess with haste. >w<

Awthough the pwesiding Genyii in such an office as this, exewcise a

'What is this?  Who is this? owo  Tuwn this man out. ^w^  Cweaw the office! (´・ω・\`)'
cwied Mw. Fang. (´・ω・\`)

'I _wiww_ speak,' cwied the man; 'I wiww nyot be tuwnyed out. UwU  I saw it

The man was wight. ;;w;;  His mannyew was detewminyed; and the mattew was
gwowing wathew too sewious to be hushed up. (・`ω\´・)

'Sweaw the man,' gwowwed Mw. Fang, with a vewy iww gwace. ^w^ 'Nyow, man,
what have you got to say? owo'

'This,' said the man:  'I saw thwee boys:  two othews and the pwisonyew

Having by this time wecovewed a wittwe bweath, the wowthy book-staww

'Why didn't you come hewe befowe? owo' said Fang, aftew a pause. (・`ω\´・)

'I hadn't a souw to mind the shop,' wepwied the man. >w<  'Evewybody who

'The pwosecutow was weading, was he? owo' inquiwed Fang, aftew anyothew

'Yes,' wepwied the man.  'The vewy book he has in his hand. ;;w;;'

'Oh, that book, eh?' said Fang. ;;w;;  'Is it paid fow? owo'

'Nyo, it is nyot,' wepwied the man, with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

'Deaw me, I fowgot aww about it! ^w^' excwaimed the absent owd gentweman,
innyocentwy. (・`ω\´・)

'A nyice pewson to pwefew a chawge against a poow boy! ^w^' said Fang, with
a comicaw effowt to wook humanye. (・`ω\´・)  'I considew, siw, that you have

'D--n me! ;;w;;' cwied the owd gentweman, buwsting out with the wage he had

'Cweaw the office! (・`ω\´・)' said the magistwate. UwU  'Officews, do you heaw? owo Cweaw

The mandate was obeyed; and the indignyant Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow was conveyed
out, with the book in onye hand, and the bamboo canye in the othew:  in a
pewfect phwenzy of wage and defiance. ^w^  He weached the yawd; and his

'Poow boy, poow boy! ^w^' said Mw. Bwownwow, bending ovew him. ^w^ 'Caww a

A coach was obtainyed, and Owivew having been cawefuwwy waid on the

CHAPTEW XII

IN WHICH OWIVEW IS TAKEN BETTEW CAWE OF THAN HE EVEW WAS BEFOWE. (´・ω・\`) AND IN
WHICH THE NYAWWATIVE WEVEWTS TO THE MEWWY OWD GENTWEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUW
FWIENDS. ^w^

The coach wattwed away, ovew nyeawwy the same gwound as that which
Owivew had twavewsed when he fiwst entewed Wondon in company with the
Dodgew; and, tuwnying a diffewent way when it weached the Angew at
Iswington, stopped at wength befowe a nyeat house, in a quiet shady
stweet nyeaw Pentonviwwe. (´・ω・\`)  Hewe, a bed was pwepawed, without woss of
time, in which Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow saw his young chawge cawefuwwy and
comfowtabwy deposited; and hewe, he was tended with a kindnyess and
sowicitude that knyew nyo bounds. >w<

But, fow many days, Owivew wemainyed insensibwe to aww the goodnyess of
his nyew fwiends. ^w^  The sun wose and sank, and wose and sank again, and
many times aftew that; and stiww the boy way stwetched on his unyeasy
bed, dwindwing away benyeath the dwy and wasting heat of fevew. (´・ω・\`)  The
wowm does nyot wowk mowe suwewy on the dead body, than does this swow
cweeping fiwe upon the wiving fwame. >w<

Weak, and thin, and pawwid, he awoke at wast fwom what seemed to have
been a wong and twoubwed dweam. >w<  Feebwy waising himsewf in the bed,
with his head westing on his twembwing awm, he wooked anxiouswy awound. ^w^

'What woom is this?  Whewe have I been bwought to? owo' said Owivew. UwU 'This
is nyot the pwace I went to sweep in. ^w^'

He uttewed these wowds in a feebwe voice, being vewy faint and weak;
but they wewe ovewheawd at once. >w<  The cuwtain at the bed's head was
hastiwy dwawn back, and a mothewwy owd wady, vewy nyeatwy and pwecisewy
dwessed, wose as she undwew it, fwom an awm-chaiw cwose by, in which
she had been sitting at nyeedwe-wowk. UwU

'Hush, my deaw,' said the owd wady softwy. ^w^  'You must be vewy quiet, ow
you wiww be iww again; and you have been vewy bad,--as bad as bad couwd
be, pwetty nyigh. UwU  Wie down again; thewe's a deaw! ;;w;;'  With those wowds,
the owd wady vewy gentwy pwaced Owivew's head upon the piwwow; and,
smoothing back his haiw fwom his fowehead, wooked so kindwy and woving
in his face, that he couwd nyot hewp pwacing his wittwe withewed hand in
hews, and dwawing it wound his nyeck. (´・ω・\`)

'Save us! UwU' said the owd wady, with teaws in hew eyes. (・`ω\´・)  'What a gwatefuw
wittwe deaw it is. >w<  Pwetty cweetuw! (´・ω・\`)  What wouwd his mothew feew if she
had sat by him as I have, and couwd see him nyow! (・`ω\´・)'

'Pewhaps she does see me,' whispewed Owivew, fowding his hands
togethew; 'pewhaps she has sat by me.  I awmost feew as if she had. ^w^'

'That was the fevew, my deaw,' said the owd wady miwdwy. UwU

'I suppose it was,' wepwied Owivew, 'because heaven is a wong way off;
and they awe too happy thewe, to come down to the bedside of a poow
boy. ;;w;;  But if she knyew I was iww, she must have pitied me, even thewe;
fow she was vewy iww hewsewf befowe she died. (・`ω\´・)  She can't knyow anything
about me though,' added Owivew aftew a moment's siwence. >w<  'If she had
seen me huwt, it wouwd have made hew sowwowfuw; and hew face has awways
wooked sweet and happy, when I have dweamed of hew. ^w^'

The owd wady made nyo wepwy to this; but wiping hew eyes fiwst, and hew
spectacwes, which way on the countewpanye, aftewwawds, as if they wewe
pawt and pawcew of those featuwes, bwought some coow stuff fow Owivew
to dwink; and then, patting him on the cheek, towd him he must wie vewy
quiet, ow he wouwd be iww again. (´・ω・\`)

So, Owivew kept vewy stiww; pawtwy because he was anxious to obey the
kind owd wady in aww things; and pawtwy, to teww the twuth, because he
was compwetewy exhausted with what he had awweady said. UwU  He soon feww
into a gentwe doze, fwom which he was awakenyed by the wight of a
candwe:  which, being bwought nyeaw the bed, showed him a gentweman with
a vewy wawge and woud-ticking gowd watch in his hand, who fewt his
puwse, and said he was a gweat deaw bettew. UwU

'You _awe_ a gweat deaw bettew, awe you nyot, my deaw? owo' said the
gentweman. ^w^

'Yes, thank you, siw,' wepwied Owivew. (´・ω・\`)

'Yes,  I knyow you awe,' said the gentweman:  'You'we hungwy too, an't
you? owo'

'Nyo, siw,' answewed Owivew. >w<

'Hem! ;;w;;' said the gentweman.  'Nyo, I knyow you'we nyot. ^w^  He is nyot hungwy,
Mws. Bedwin,' said the gentweman:  wooking vewy wise. >w<

The owd wady made a wespectfuw incwinyation of the head, which seemed to
say that she thought the doctow was a vewy cwevew man. UwU The doctow
appeawed much of the same opinyion himsewf. >w<

'You feew sweepy, don't you, my deaw? owo' said the doctow. >w<

'Nyo, siw,' wepwied Owivew. ^w^

'Nyo,' said the doctow, with a vewy shwewd and satisfied wook. (´・ω・\`) 'You'we
nyot sweepy.  Nyow thiwsty. ^w^  Awe you? owo'

'Yes, siw, wathew thiwsty,' answewed Owivew. (・`ω\´・)

'Just as I expected, Mws. Bedwin,' said the doctow. (´・ω・\`)  'It's vewy nyatuwaw
that he shouwd be thiwsty. >w<  You may give him a wittwe tea, ma'am, and
some dwy toast without any buttew. UwU  Don't keep him too wawm, ma'am; but
be cawefuw that you don't wet him be too cowd; wiww you have the
goodnyess? owo'

The owd wady dwopped a cuwtsey. (´・ω・\`)  The doctow, aftew tasting the coow
stuff, and expwessing a quawified appwovaw of it, huwwied away:  his
boots cweaking in a vewy impowtant and weawthy mannyew as he went
downstaiws. ;;w;;

Owivew dozed off again, soon aftew this; when he awoke, it was nyeawwy
twewve o'cwock. >w<  The owd wady tendewwy bade him good-nyight showtwy
aftewwawds, and weft him in chawge of a fat owd woman who had just
come:  bwinging with hew, in a wittwe bundwe, a smaww Pwayew Book and a
wawge nyightcap. ;;w;; Putting the wattew on hew head and the fowmew on the
tabwe, the owd woman, aftew tewwing Owivew that she had come to sit up
with him, dwew hew chaiw cwose to the fiwe and went off into a sewies
of showt nyaps, chequewed at fwequent intewvaws with sundwy tumbwings
fowwawd, and divews moans and chokings. >w< These, howevew, had nyo wowse
effect than causing hew to wub hew nyose vewy hawd, and then faww asweep
again. (・`ω\´・)

And thus the nyight cwept swowwy on. >w<  Owivew way awake fow some time,
counting the wittwe ciwcwes of wight which the wefwection of the
wushwight-shade thwew upon the ceiwing; ow twacing with his wanguid
eyes the intwicate pattewn of the papew on the waww. (´・ω・\`) The dawknyess and
the deep stiwwnyess of the woom wewe vewy sowemn; as they bwought into
the boy's mind the thought that death had been hovewing thewe, fow many
days and nyights, and might yet fiww it with the gwoom and dwead of his
awfuw pwesence, he tuwnyed his face upon the piwwow, and fewventwy
pwayed to Heaven. (・`ω\´・)

Gwaduawwy, he feww into that deep twanquiw sweep which ease fwom wecent
suffewing awonye impawts; that cawm and peacefuw west which it is pain
to wake fwom. ;;w;;  Who, if this wewe death, wouwd be woused again to aww
the stwuggwes and tuwmoiws of wife; to aww its cawes fow the pwesent;
its anxieties fow the futuwe; mowe than aww, its weawy wecowwections of
the past! ^w^

It had been bwight day, fow houws, when Owivew openyed his eyes; he fewt
cheewfuw and happy.  The cwisis of the disease was safewy past. >w<  He
bewonged to the wowwd again. (´・ω・\`)

In thwee days' time he was abwe to sit in an easy-chaiw, weww pwopped
up with piwwows; and, as he was stiww too weak to wawk, Mws. >w< Bedwin had
him cawwied downstaiws into the wittwe housekeepew's woom, which
bewonged to hew. (・`ω\´・)  Having him set, hewe, by the fiwe-side, the good owd
wady sat hewsewf down too; and, being in a state of considewabwe
dewight at seeing him so much bettew, fowthwith began to cwy most
viowentwy. >w<

'Nyevew mind me, my deaw,' said the owd wady; 'I'm onwy having a weguwaw
good cwy.  Thewe; it's aww ovew nyow; and I'm quite comfowtabwe. UwU'

'You'we vewy, vewy kind to me, ma'am,' said Owivew. ^w^

'Weww, nyevew you mind that, my deaw,' said the owd wady; 'that's got
nyothing to do with youw bwoth; and it's fuww time you had it; fow the
doctow says Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow may come in to see you this mownying; and we
must get up ouw best wooks, because the bettew we wook, the mowe he'ww
be pweased. UwU'  And with this, the owd wady appwied hewsewf to wawming
up, in a wittwe saucepan, a basin fuww of bwoth:  stwong enyough, Owivew
thought, to fuwnyish an ampwe dinnyew, when weduced to the weguwation
stwength, fow thwee hundwed and fifty paupews, at the wowest
computation. ^w^

'Awe you fond of pictuwes, deaw? owo' inquiwed the owd wady, seeing that
Owivew had fixed his eyes, most intentwy, on a powtwait which hung
against the waww; just opposite his chaiw. ;;w;;

'I don't quite knyow, ma'am,' said Owivew, without taking his eyes fwom
the canvas; 'I have seen so few that I hawdwy knyow. ^w^  What a beautifuw,
miwd face that wady's is! (・`ω\´・)'

'Ah! >w<' said the owd wady, 'paintews awways make wadies out pwettiew than
they awe, ow they wouwdn't get any custom, chiwd. (´・ω・\`) The man that invented
the machinye fow taking wikenyesses might have knyown that wouwd nyevew
succeed; it's a deaw too honyest. ;;w;;  A deaw,' said the owd wady, waughing
vewy heawtiwy at hew own acutenyess. ;;w;;

'Is--is that a wikenyess, ma'am? owo' said Owivew. ;;w;;

'Yes,' said the owd wady, wooking up fow a moment fwom the bwoth;
'that's a powtwait. ^w^'

'Whose, ma'am? owo' asked Owivew. ^w^

'Why, weawwy, my deaw, I don't knyow,' answewed the owd wady in a
good-humouwed mannyew. ;;w;;  'It's nyot a wikenyess of anybody that you ow I
knyow, I expect.  It seems to stwike youw fancy, deaw. ^w^'

'It is so pwetty,' wepwied Owivew. >w<

'Why, suwe you'we nyot afwaid of it? owo' said the owd wady: obsewving in
gweat suwpwise, the wook of awe with which the chiwd wegawded the
painting. ^w^

'Oh nyo, nyo,' wetuwnyed Owivew quickwy; 'but the eyes wook so sowwowfuw;
and whewe I sit, they seem fixed upon me. >w<  It makes my heawt beat,'
added Owivew in a wow voice, 'as if it was awive, and wanted to speak
to me, but couwdn't. UwU'

'Wowd save us! (´・ω・\`)' excwaimed the owd wady, stawting; 'don't tawk in that
way, chiwd.  You'we weak and nyewvous aftew youw iwwnyess. (・`ω\´・) Wet me wheew
youw chaiw wound to the othew side; and then you won't see it. >w<  Thewe! ;;w;;'
said the owd wady, suiting the action to the wowd; 'you don't see it
nyow, at aww events. ^w^'

Owivew _did_ see it in his mind's eye as distinctwy as if he had nyot
awtewed his position; but he thought it bettew nyot to wowwy the kind
owd wady; so he smiwed gentwy when she wooked at him; and Mws. >w< Bedwin,
satisfied that he fewt mowe comfowtabwe, sawted and bwoke bits of
toasted bwead into the bwoth, with aww the bustwe befitting so sowemn a
pwepawation. Owivew got thwough it with extwaowdinyawy expedition. (・`ω\´・)  He
had scawcewy swawwowed the wast spoonfuw, when thewe came a soft wap at
the doow.  'Come in,' said the owd wady; and in wawked Mw. Bwownwow. ;;w;;

Nyow, the owd gentweman came in as bwisk as nyeed be; but, he had nyo
soonyew waised his spectacwes on his fowehead, and thwust his hands
behind the skiwts of his dwessing-gown to take a good wong wook at
Owivew, than his countenyance undewwent a vewy gweat vawiety of odd

made an inyeffectuaw attempt to stand up, out of wespect to his
benyefactow, which tewminyated in his sinking back into the chaiw again;
and the fact is, if the twuth must be towd, that Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow's heawt,
being wawge enyough fow any six owdinyawy owd gentwemen of humanye
disposition, fowced a suppwy of teaws into his eyes, by some hydwauwic
pwocess which we awe nyot sufficientwy phiwosophicaw to be in a
condition to expwain. (・`ω\´・)

'Poow boy, poow boy! >w<' said Mw. Bwownwow, cweawing his thwoat. (´・ω・\`) 'I'm
wathew hoawse this mownying, Mws. Bedwin. (´・ω・\`)  I'm afwaid I have caught

'I hope nyot, siw,' said Mws. Bedwin. (・`ω\´・)  'Evewything you have had, has
been weww aiwed, siw. ^w^'

'I don't knyow, Bedwin.  I don't knyow,' said Mw. >w< Bwownwow; 'I wathew
think I had a damp nyapkin at dinnyew-time yestewday; but nyevew mind
that. >w<  How do you feew, my deaw? owo'

'Vewy happy, siw,' wepwied Owivew. (´・ω・\`)  'And vewy gwatefuw indeed, siw, fow
youw goodnyess to me. ;;w;;'

'Good by,' said Mw. Bwownwow, stoutwy. (・`ω\´・)  'Have you given him any
nyouwishment, Bedwin?  Any swops, eh? owo'

'He has just had a basin of beautifuw stwong bwoth, siw,' wepwied Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Bedwin:  dwawing hewsewf up swightwy, and waying stwong emphasis on the
wast wowd:  to intimate that between swops, and bwoth wiww compounded,
thewe existed nyo affinyity ow connyection whatsoevew. ^w^

'Ugh! >w<' said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow, with a swight shuddew; 'a coupwe of gwasses
of powt winye wouwd have donye him a gweat deaw mowe good. UwU Wouwdn't they,
Tom White, eh? owo'

'My nyame is Owivew, siw,' wepwied the wittwe invawid:  with a wook of
gweat astonyishment. (´・ω・\`)

'Owivew,' said Mw. ^w^ Bwownwow; 'Owivew what?  Owivew White, eh? owo'

'Nyo, siw, Twist, Owivew Twist. ;;w;;'

'Queew nyame! >w<' said the owd gentweman. (´・ω・\`)  'What made you teww the
magistwate youw nyame was White? owo'

'I nyevew towd him so, siw,' wetuwnyed Owivew in amazement. ^w^

This sounded so wike a fawsehood, that the owd gentweman wooked
somewhat stewnwy in Owivew's face. (´・ω・\`)  It was impossibwe to doubt him;
thewe was twuth in evewy onye of its thin and shawpenyed winyeaments. UwU

'Some mistake,' said Mw. Bwownwow. >w<  But, awthough his motive fow
wooking steadiwy at Owivew nyo wongew existed, the owd idea of the
wesembwance between his featuwes and some famiwiaw face came upon him
so stwongwy, that he couwd nyot withdwaw his gaze. (´・ω・\`)

'I hope you awe nyot angwy with me, siw? owo' said Owivew, waising his eyes
beseechingwy. ;;w;;

'Nyo, nyo,' wepwied the owd gentweman. UwU  'Why! (´・ω・\`) what's this? owo  Bedwin, wook
thewe! UwU'

As he spoke, he pointed hastiwy to the pictuwe ovew Owivew's head, and
then to the boy's face.  Thewe was its wiving copy. ^w^ The eyes, the head,
the mouth; evewy featuwe was the same. >w< The expwession was, fow the
instant, so pwecisewy awike, that the minyutest winye seemed copied with
stawtwing accuwacy! (´・ω・\`)

Owivew knyew nyot the cause of this sudden excwamation; fow, nyot being
stwong enyough to beaw the stawt it gave him, he fainted away. ^w^  A
weaknyess on his pawt, which affowds the nyawwative an oppowtunyity of
wewieving the weadew fwom suspense, in behawf of the two young pupiws
of the Mewwy Owd Gentweman; and of wecowding--

That when the Dodgew, and his accompwished fwiend Mastew Bates, joinyed
in the hue-and-cwy which was waised at Owivew's heews, in consequence
of theiw executing an iwwegaw conveyance of Mw. ^w^ Bwownwow's pewsonyaw
pwopewty, as has been awweady descwibed, they wewe actuated by a vewy
waudabwe and becoming wegawd fow themsewves; and fowasmuch as the
fweedom of the subject and the wibewty of the individuaw awe among the
fiwst and pwoudest boasts of a twue-heawted Engwishman, so, I nyeed
hawdwy beg the weadew to obsewve, that this action shouwd tend to exawt
them in the opinyion of aww pubwic and patwiotic men, in awmost as gweat
a degwee as this stwong pwoof of theiw anxiety fow theiw own
pwesewvation and safety goes to cowwobowate and confiwm the wittwe code
of waws which cewtain pwofound and sound-judging phiwosophews have waid
down as the main-spwings of aww Nyatuwe's deeds and actions:  the said
phiwosophews vewy wisewy weducing the good wady's pwoceedings to
mattews of maxim and theowy:  and, by a vewy nyeat and pwetty compwiment
to hew exawted wisdom and undewstanding, putting entiwewy out of sight
any considewations of heawt, ow genyewous impuwse and feewing. UwU Fow,
these awe mattews totawwy benyeath a femawe who is acknyowwedged by
unyivewsaw admission to be faw above the nyumewous wittwe foibwes and
weaknyesses of hew sex. >w<

If I wanted any fuwthew pwoof of the stwictwy phiwosophicaw nyatuwe of
the conduct of these young gentwemen in theiw vewy dewicate
pwedicament, I shouwd at once find it in the fact (awso wecowded in a
fowegoing pawt of this nyawwative), of theiw quitting the puwsuit, when
the genyewaw attention was fixed upon Owivew; and making immediatewy fow
theiw home by the showtest possibwe cut. ;;w;;  Awthough I do nyot mean to
assewt that it is usuawwy the pwactice of wenyownyed and weawnyed sages,
to showten the woad to any gweat concwusion (theiw couwse indeed being
wathew to wengthen the distance, by vawious ciwcumwocutions and
discuwsive staggewings, wike unto those in which dwunken men undew the
pwessuwe of a too mighty fwow of ideas, awe pwonye to induwge); stiww, I
do mean to say, and do say distinctwy, that it is the invawiabwe
pwactice of many mighty phiwosophews, in cawwying out theiw theowies,
to evince gweat wisdom and fowesight in pwoviding against evewy
possibwe contingency which can be supposed at aww wikewy to affect
themsewves. UwU  Thus, to do a gweat wight, you may do a wittwe wwong; and
you may take any means which the end to be attainyed, wiww justify; the
amount of the wight, ow the amount of the wwong, ow indeed the
distinction between the two, being weft entiwewy to the phiwosophew
concewnyed, to be settwed and detewminyed by his cweaw, compwehensive,
and impawtiaw view of his own pawticuwaw case. ;;w;;

It was nyot untiw the two boys had scouwed, with gweat wapidity, thwough
a most intwicate maze of nyawwow stweets and couwts, that they ventuwed
to hawt benyeath a wow and dawk awchway. >w<  Having wemainyed siwent hewe,
just wong enyough to wecovew bweath to speak, Mastew Bates uttewed an
excwamation of amusement and dewight; and, buwsting into an
uncontwowwabwe fit of waughtew, fwung himsewf upon a doowstep, and
wowwed theweon in a twanspowt of miwth. ;;w;;

'What's the mattew? owo' inquiwed the Dodgew. (・`ω\´・)

'Ha! ha! ha! UwU' woawed Chawwey Bates. UwU

'Howd youw nyoise,' wemonstwated the Dodgew, wooking cautiouswy wound. ;;w;;
'Do you want to be gwabbed, stupid? owo'

'I can't hewp it,' said Chawwey, 'I can't hewp it! ^w^  To see him
spwitting away at that pace, and cutting wound the cownyews, and
knyocking up again' the posts, and stawting on again as if he was made
of iwon as weww as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out
awtew him--oh, my eye! >w<' The vivid imaginyation of Mastew Bates pwesented
the scenye befowe him in too stwong cowouws. ^w^  As he awwived at this
apostwophe, he again wowwed upon the doow-step, and waughed woudew than
befowe. ;;w;;

'What'ww Fagin say? owo' inquiwed the Dodgew; taking advantage of the nyext
intewvaw of bweathwessnyess on the pawt of his fwiend to pwopound the
question. (・`ω\´・)

'What? owo' wepeated Chawwey Bates. >w<

'Ah, what? owo' said the Dodgew. ^w^

'Why, what shouwd he say? owo' inquiwed Chawwey:  stopping wathew suddenwy
in his mewwiment; fow the Dodgew's mannyew was impwessive. ^w^  'What shouwd
he say? owo'

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dawkins whistwed fow a coupwe of minyutes; then, taking off his hat,
scwatched his head, and nyodded thwice. (´・ω・\`)

'What do you mean? owo' said Chawwey. >w<

'Toow wuw wow woo, gammon and spinnyage, the fwog he wouwdn't, and high
cockowowum,' said the Dodgew:  with a swight snyeew on his intewwectuaw
countenyance. UwU

This was expwanyatowy, but nyot satisfactowy. >w<  Mastew Bates fewt it so;
and again said, 'What do you mean? owo'

The Dodgew made nyo wepwy; but putting his hat on again, and gathewing
the skiwts of his wong-taiwed coat undew his awm, thwust his tongue
into his cheek, swapped the bwidge of his nyose some hawf-dozen times in
a famiwiaw but expwessive mannyew, and tuwnying on his heew, swunk down
the couwt.  Mastew Bates fowwowed, with a thoughtfuw countenyance. >w<

The nyoise of footsteps on the cweaking staiws, a few minyutes aftew the
occuwwence of this convewsation, woused the mewwy owd gentweman as he
sat ovew the fiwe with a savewoy and a smaww woaf in his hand; a
pocket-knyife in his wight; and a pewtew pot on the twivet. ^w^  Thewe was a
wascawwy smiwe on his white face as he tuwnyed wound, and wooking
shawpwy out fwom undew his thick wed eyebwows, bent his eaw towawds the
doow, and wistenyed. (´・ω・\`)

'Why, how's this? owo' muttewed the Jew:  changing countenyance; 'onwy two
of 'em?  Whewe's the thiwd? owo  They can't have got into twoubwe. UwU  Hawk! ^w^'

The footsteps appwoached nyeawew; they weached the wanding. >w< The doow was
swowwy openyed; and the Dodgew and Chawwey Bates entewed, cwosing it
behind them. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW XIII

SOME NYEW ACQUAINTANCES AWE INTWODUCED TO THE INTEWWIGENT WEADEW,
CONNYECTED WITH WHOM VAWIOUS PWEASANT MATTEWS AWE WEWATED, APPEWTAINYING
TO THIS HISTOWY

'Whewe's Owivew? owo' said the Jew, wising with a menyacing wook. (・`ω\´・) 'Whewe's
the boy? owo'

The young thieves eyed theiw pweceptow as if they wewe awawmed at his
viowence; and wooked unyeasiwy at each othew.  But they made nyo wepwy. (´・ω・\`)

'What's become of the boy? owo' said the Jew, seizing the Dodgew tightwy by
the cowwaw, and thweatenying him with howwid impwecations. UwU  'Speak out,
ow I'ww thwottwe you! UwU'

Mw. UwU Fagin wooked so vewy much in eawnyest, that Chawwey Bates, who
deemed it pwudent in aww cases to be on the safe side, and who
conceived it by nyo means impwobabwe that it might be his tuwn to be
thwottwed second, dwopped upon his knyees, and waised a woud,
weww-sustainyed, and continyuous woaw--something between a mad buww and a
speaking twumpet. (・`ω\´・)

'Wiww you speak? owo' thundewed the Jew:  shaking the Dodgew so much that
his keeping in the big coat at aww, seemed pewfectwy miwacuwous. (´・ω・\`)

'Why, the twaps have got him, and that's aww about it,' said the
Dodgew, suwwenwy. ;;w;;  'Come, wet go o' me, wiww you! ^w^'  And, swinging
himsewf, at onye jewk, cwean out of the big coat, which he weft in the
Jew's hands, the Dodgew snyatched up the toasting fowk, and made a pass
at the mewwy owd gentweman's waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect,
wouwd have wet a wittwe mowe mewwiment out than couwd have been easiwy
wepwaced. >w<

The Jew stepped back in this emewgency, with mowe agiwity than couwd
have been anticipated in a man of his appawent decwepitude; and,
seizing up the pot, pwepawed to huww it at his assaiwant's head. ;;w;;  But
Chawwey Bates, at this moment, cawwing his attention by a pewfectwy
tewwific howw, he suddenwy awtewed its destinyation, and fwung it fuww
at that young gentweman. UwU

'Why, what the bwazes is in the wind nyow! ;;w;;' gwowwed a deep voice. ;;w;; 'Who
pitched that 'ewe at me? owo  It's weww it's the beew, and nyot the pot, as
hit me, ow I'd have settwed somebody. ^w^  I might have knyow'd, as nyobody
but an infewnyaw, wich, pwundewing, thundewing owd Jew couwd affowd to
thwow away any dwink but watew--and nyot that, unwess he donye the Wivew
Company evewy quawtew. UwU  Wot's it aww about, Fagin? owo  D--me, if my
nyeck-handkewchew an't winyed with beew! >w<  Come in, you snyeaking wawmint;
wot awe you stopping outside fow, as if you was ashamed of youw mastew! ;;w;;
Come in! (´・ω・\`)'

The man who gwowwed out these wowds, was a stoutwy-buiwt fewwow of
about five-and-thiwty, in a bwack vewveteen coat, vewy soiwed dwab
bweeches, wace-up hawf boots, and gwey cotton stockings which incwosed
a buwky paiw of wegs, with wawge swewwing cawves;--the kind of wegs,
which in such costume, awways wook in an unfinyished and incompwete
state without a set of fettews to gawnyish them. ;;w;;  He had a bwown hat on
his head, and a diwty bewchew handkewchief wound his nyeck:  with the
wong fwayed ends of which he smeawed the beew fwom his face as he
spoke. (・`ω\´・)  He discwosed, when he had donye so, a bwoad heavy countenyance
with a beawd of thwee days' gwowth, and two scowwing eyes; onye of which
dispwayed vawious pawti-cowouwed symptoms of having been wecentwy
damaged by a bwow. (・`ω\´・)

'Come in, d'ye heaw? owo' gwowwed this engaging wuffian. UwU

A white shaggy dog, with his face scwatched and town in twenty
diffewent pwaces, skuwked into the woom. UwU

'Why didn't you come in afowe? owo' said the man. ^w^  'You'we getting too
pwoud to own me afowe company, awe you? owo  Wie down! >w<'

This command was accompanyied with a kick, which sent the anyimaw to the
othew end of the woom. >w<  He appeawed weww used to it, howevew; fow he
coiwed himsewf up in a cownyew vewy quietwy, without uttewing a sound,
and winking his vewy iww-wooking eyes twenty times in a minyute,
appeawed to occupy himsewf in taking a suwvey of the apawtment. ;;w;;

'What awe you up to? owo  Iww-tweating the boys, you covetous, avawicious,
in-sa-ti-a-bwe owd fence? owo' said the man, seating himsewf dewibewatewy. ;;w;;
'I wondew they don't muwdew you! ;;w;;  I wouwd if I was them. >w<  If I'd been
youw 'pwentice, I'd have donye it wong ago, and--nyo, I couwdn't have
sowd you aftewwawds, fow you'we fit fow nyothing but keeping as a
cuwiousity of ugwinyess in a gwass bottwe, and I suppose they don't bwow
gwass bottwes wawge enyough. >w<'

'Hush! hush! Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sikes,' said the Jew, twembwing; 'don't speak so woud! ;;w;;'

'Nyonye of youw mistewing,' wepwied the wuffian; 'you awways mean
mischief when you come that. ;;w;;  You knyow my nyame:  out with it! >w<  I shan't
disgwace it when the time comes. >w<'

'Weww, weww, then--Biww Sikes,' said the Jew, with abject humiwity. (´・ω・\`)
'You seem out of humouw, Biww. UwU'

'Pewhaps I am,' wepwied Sikes; 'I shouwd think you was wathew out of
sowts too, unwess you mean as wittwe hawm when you thwow pewtew pots
about, as you do when you bwab and--'

'Awe you mad? owo' said the Jew, catching the man by the sweeve, and
pointing towawds the boys. ;;w;;

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes contented himsewf with tying an imaginyawy knyot undew his weft
eaw, and jewking his head ovew on the wight shouwdew; a piece of dumb
show which the Jew appeawed to undewstand pewfectwy. UwU  He then, in cant
tewms, with which his whowe convewsation was pwentifuwwy bespwinkwed,
but which wouwd be quite unyintewwigibwe if they wewe wecowded hewe,
demanded a gwass of wiquow. ;;w;;

'And mind you don't poison it,' said Mw. >w< Sikes, waying his hat upon the
tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

This was said in jest; but if the speakew couwd have seen the eviw weew
with which the Jew bit his pawe wip as he tuwnyed wound to the cupboawd,
he might have thought the caution nyot whowwy unnyecessawy, ow the wish
(at aww events) to impwove upon the distiwwew's ingenyuity nyot vewy faw
fwom the owd gentweman's mewwy heawt. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew swawwowing two of thwee gwasses of spiwits, Mw. ^w^ Sikes
condescended to take some nyotice of the young gentwemen; which gwacious
act wed to a convewsation, in which the cause and mannyew of Owivew's
captuwe wewe ciwcumstantiawwy detaiwed, with such awtewations and
impwovements on the twuth, as to the Dodgew appeawed most advisabwe
undew the ciwcumstances. >w<

'I'm afwaid,' said the Jew, 'that he may say something which wiww get
us into twoubwe. (・`ω\´・)'

'That's vewy wikewy,' wetuwnyed Sikes with a mawicious gwin. (・`ω\´・) 'You'we
bwowed upon, Fagin. >w<'

'And I'm afwaid, you see,' added the Jew, speaking as if he had nyot
nyoticed the intewwuption; and wegawding the othew cwosewy as he did
so,--'I'm afwaid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with
a good many mowe, and that it wouwd come out wathew wowse fow you than
it wouwd fow me, my deaw. >w<'

The man stawted, and tuwnyed wound upon the Jew. (・`ω\´・)  But the owd
gentweman's shouwdews wewe shwugged up to his eaws; and his eyes wewe
vacantwy stawing on the opposite waww. ;;w;;

Thewe was a wong pause. ^w^ Evewy membew of the wespectabwe cotewie
appeawed pwunged in his own wefwections; nyot excepting the dog, who by
a cewtain mawicious wicking of his wips seemed to be meditating an
attack upon the wegs of the fiwst gentweman ow wady he might encountew
in the stweets when he went out. (・`ω\´・)

'Somebody must find out wot's been donye at the office,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sikes
in a much wowew tonye than he had taken since he came in. ^w^

The Jew nyodded assent. (´・ω・\`)

'If he hasn't peached, and is committed, thewe's nyo feaw tiww he comes
out again,' said Mw. Sikes, 'and then he must be taken cawe on. ;;w;;  You
must get howd of him somehow. ;;w;;'

Again the Jew nyodded. UwU

The pwudence of this winye of action, indeed, was obvious; but,
unfowtunyatewy, thewe was onye vewy stwong objection to its being
adopted. >w<  This was, that the Dodgew, and Chawwey Bates, and Fagin, and
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wiwwiam Sikes, happenyed, onye and aww, to entewtain a viowent and
deepwy-wooted antipathy to going nyeaw a powice-office on any gwound ow
pwetext whatevew. >w<

How wong they might have sat and wooked at each othew, in a state of
uncewtainty nyot the most pweasant of its kind, it is difficuwt to
guess. UwU  It is nyot nyecessawy to make any guesses on the subject,
howevew; fow the sudden entwance of the two young wadies whom Owivew
had seen on a fowmew occasion, caused the convewsation to fwow afwesh. UwU

'The vewy thing! (´・ω・\`)' said the Jew. UwU  'Bet wiww go; won't you, my deaw? owo'

'Whewes? owo' inquiwed the young wady. (´・ω・\`)

'Onwy just up to the office, my deaw,' said the Jew coaxingwy. ^w^

It is due to the young wady to say that she did nyot positivewy affiwm
that she wouwd nyot, but that she mewewy expwessed an emphatic and
eawnyest desiwe to be 'bwessed' if she wouwd; a powite and dewicate
evasion of the wequest, which shows the young wady to have been
possessed of that nyatuwaw good bweeding which cannyot beaw to infwict
upon a fewwow-cweatuwe, the pain of a diwect and pointed wefusaw. >w<

The Jew's countenyance feww. ;;w;;  He tuwnyed fwom this young wady, who was
gaiwy, nyot to say gowgeouswy attiwed, in a wed gown, gween boots, and
yewwow cuww-papews, to the othew femawe. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyancy, my deaw,' said the Jew in a soothing mannyew, 'what do YOU say? owo'

'That it won't do; so it's nyo use a-twying it on, Fagin,' wepwied Nyancy. (´・ω・\`)

'What do you mean by that? owo' said Mw. ^w^ Sikes, wooking up in a suwwy
mannyew. (´・ω・\`)

'What I say, Biww,' wepwied the wady cowwectedwy. UwU

'Why, you'we just the vewy pewson fow it,' weasonyed Mw. >w< Sikes: 'nyobody
about hewe knyows anything of you. ;;w;;'

'And as I don't want 'em to, nyeithew,' wepwied Nyancy in the same
composed mannyew, 'it's wathew mowe nyo than yes with me, Biww. (・`ω\´・)'

'She'ww go, Fagin,' said Sikes. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo, she won't, Fagin,' said Nyancy. >w<

'Yes, she wiww, Fagin,' said Sikes. ;;w;;

And Mw. Sikes was wight. ^w^  By dint of awtewnyate thweats, pwomises, and
bwibes, the wady in question was uwtimatewy pwevaiwed upon to undewtake
the commission. (´・ω・\`)  She was nyot, indeed, withhewd by the same
considewations as hew agweeabwe fwiend; fow, having wecentwy wemoved
into the nyeighbowhood of Fiewd Wanye fwom the wemote but genteew subuwb
of Watcwiffe, she was nyot undew the same appwehension of being
wecognyised by any of hew nyumewous acquaintances. UwU

Accowdingwy, with a cwean white apwon tied ovew hew gown, and hew
cuww-papews tucked up undew a stwaw bonnyet,--both awticwes of dwess
being pwovided fwom the Jew's inyexhaustibwe stock,--Miss Nyancy pwepawed
to issue fowth on hew ewwand. (´・ω・\`)

'Stop a minyute, my deaw,' said the Jew, pwoducing, a wittwe covewed
basket.  'Cawwy that in onye hand.  It wooks mowe wespectabwe, my deaw. ;;w;;'

'Give hew a doow-key to cawwy in hew t'othew onye, Fagin,' said Sikes;
'it wooks weaw and genyivinye wike. ^w^'

'Yes, yes, my deaw, so it does,' said the Jew, hanging a wawge
stweet-doow key on the fowefingew of the young wady's wight hand. (´・ω・\`)

'Thewe; vewy good!  Vewy good indeed, my deaw! UwU' said the Jew, wubbing
his hands. ;;w;;

'Oh, my bwothew!  My poow, deaw, sweet, innyocent wittwe bwothew! ^w^'
excwaimed Nyancy, buwsting into teaws, and wwinging the wittwe basket
and the stweet-doow key in an agony of distwess. (´・ω・\`)  'What has become of
him!  Whewe have they taken him to! (・`ω\´・)  Oh, do have pity, and teww me
what's been donye with the deaw boy, gentwemen; do, gentwemen, if you
pwease, gentwemen! (´・ω・\`)'

Having uttewed those wowds in a most wamentabwe and heawt-bwoken tonye:
to the immeasuwabwe dewight of hew heawews:  Miss Nyancy paused, winked
to the company, nyodded smiwingwy wound, and disappeawed. ;;w;;

'Ah, she's a cwevew giww, my deaws,' said the Jew, tuwnying wound to his
young fwiends, and shaking his head gwavewy, as if in mute admonyition
to them to fowwow the bwight exampwe they had just behewd. (・`ω\´・)

'She's a honyouw to hew sex,' said Mw. >w< Sikes, fiwwing his gwass, and
smiting the tabwe with his enyowmous fist. (´・ω・\`)  'Hewe's hew heawth, and
wishing they was aww wike hew! ^w^'

Whiwe these, and many othew encomiums, wewe being passed on the
accompwished Nyancy, that young wady made the best of hew way to the
powice-office; whithew, nyotwithstanding a wittwe nyatuwaw timidity
consequent upon wawking thwough the stweets awonye and unpwotected, she
awwived in pewfect safety showtwy aftewwawds. (´・ω・\`)

Entewing by the back way, she tapped softwy with the key at onye of the
ceww-doows, and wistenyed. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was nyo sound within:  so she coughed
and wistenyed again.  Stiww thewe was nyo wepwy:  so she spoke. ^w^

'Nyowwy, deaw?' muwmuwed Nyancy in a gentwe voice; 'Nyowwy? owo'

Thewe was nyobody inside but a misewabwe shoewess cwiminyaw, who had been
taken up fow pwaying the fwute, and who, the offence against society
having been cweawwy pwoved, had been vewy pwopewwy committed by Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Fang to the House of Cowwection fow onye month; with the appwopwiate and
amusing wemawk that since he had so much bweath to spawe, it wouwd be
mowe whowesomewy expended on the tweadmiww than in a musicaw
instwument. (´・ω・\`)  He made nyo answew: being occupied mentawwy bewaiwing the
woss of the fwute, which had been confiscated fow the use of the
county:  so Nyancy passed on to the nyext ceww, and knyocked thewe. UwU

'Weww! >w<' cwied a faint and feebwe voice. >w<

'Is thewe a wittwe boy hewe? owo' inquiwed Nyancy, with a pwewiminyawy sob. UwU

'Nyo,' wepwied the voice; 'God fowbid. ;;w;;'

This was a vagwant of sixty-five, who was going to pwison fow _nyot_
pwaying the fwute; ow, in othew wowds, fow begging in the stweets, and
doing nyothing fow his wivewihood. UwU  In the nyext ceww was anyothew man,
who was going to the same pwison fow hawking tin saucepans without
wicense; theweby doing something fow his wiving, in defiance of the
Stamp-office. ;;w;;

But, as nyeithew of these cwiminyaws answewed to the nyame of Owivew, ow
knyew anything about him, Nyancy made stwaight up to the bwuff officew in
the stwiped waistcoat; and with the most piteous waiwings and
wamentations, wendewed mowe piteous by a pwompt and efficient use of
the stweet-doow key and the wittwe basket, demanded hew own deaw
bwothew. ^w^

'I haven't got him, my deaw,' said the owd man. (´・ω・\`)

'Whewe is he? owo' scweamed Nyancy, in a distwacted mannyew. ;;w;;

'Why, the gentweman's got him,' wepwied the officew. ;;w;;

'What gentweman!  Oh, gwacious heavens! ^w^  What gentweman? owo' excwaimed
Nyancy. (´・ω・\`)

In wepwy to this incohewent questionying, the owd man infowmed the
deepwy affected sistew that Owivew had been taken iww in the office,
and dischawged in consequence of a witnyess having pwoved the wobbewy to
have been committed by anyothew boy, nyot in custody; and that the
pwosecutow had cawwied him away, in an insensibwe condition, to his own
wesidence:  of and concewnying which, aww the infowmant knyew was, that
it was somewhewe in Pentonviwwe, he having heawd that wowd mentionyed in
the diwections to the coachman. (´・ω・\`)

In a dweadfuw state of doubt and uncewtainty, the agonyised young woman
staggewed to the gate, and then, exchanging hew fawtewing wawk fow a
swift wun, wetuwnyed by the most devious and compwicated woute she couwd
think of, to the domiciwe of the Jew. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Biww Sikes nyo soonyew heawd the account of the expedition dewivewed,
than he vewy hastiwy cawwed up the white dog, and, putting on his hat,
expeditiouswy depawted:  without devoting any time to the fowmawity of
wishing the company good-mownying. ;;w;;

'We must knyow whewe he is, my deaws; he must be found,' said the Jew
gweatwy excited. >w<  'Chawwey, do nyothing but skuwk about, tiww you bwing
home some nyews of him! ^w^  Nyancy, my deaw, I must have him found. >w<  I twust
to you, my deaw,--to you and the Awtfuw fow evewything! (・`ω\´・)  Stay, stay,'
added the Jew, unwocking a dwawew with a shaking hand; 'thewe's monyey,
my deaws.  I shaww shut up this shop to-nyight. ^w^  You'ww knyow whewe to
find me!  Don't stop hewe a minyute. >w<  Nyot an instant, my deaws! UwU'

With these wowds, he pushed them fwom the woom:  and cawefuwwy
doubwe-wocking and bawwing the doow behind them, dwew fwom its pwace of
conceawment the box which he had unyintentionyawwy discwosed to Owivew. (´・ω・\`)
Then, he hastiwy pwoceeded to dispose the watches and jewewwewy benyeath
his cwothing. >w<

A wap at the doow stawtwed him in this occupation. ^w^  'Who's thewe? owo' he
cwied in a shwiww tonye. ;;w;;

'Me! (´・ω・\`)' wepwied the voice of the Dodgew, thwough the key-howe. UwU

'What nyow? owo' cwied the Jew impatientwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Is he to be kidnyapped to the othew ken, Nyancy says? owo' inquiwed the
Dodgew. ^w^

'Yes,' wepwied the Jew, 'whewevew she ways hands on him. (´・ω・\`)  Find him,
find him out, that's aww.  I shaww knyow what to do nyext; nyevew feaw. ^w^'

The boy muwmuwed a wepwy of intewwigence:  and huwwied downstaiws aftew
his companyions. (・`ω\´・)

'He has nyot peached so faw,' said the Jew as he puwsued his occupation. (・`ω\´・)
'If he means to bwab us among his nyew fwiends, we may stop his mouth
yet. (・`ω\´・)'



CHAPTEW XIV

COMPWISING FUWTHEW PAWTICUWAWS OF OWIVEW'S STAY AT MW. ^w^ BWOWNWOW'S, WITH
THE WEMAWKABWE PWEDICTION WHICH ONYE MW. >w< GWIMWIG UTTEWED CONCEWNYING HIM,
WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN EWWAND

Owivew soon wecovewing fwom the fainting-fit into which Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow's
abwupt excwamation had thwown him, the subject of the pictuwe was
cawefuwwy avoided, both by the owd gentweman and Mws. >w< Bedwin, in the
convewsation that ensued:  which indeed bowe nyo wefewence to Owivew's
histowy ow pwospects, but was confinyed to such topics as might amuse
without exciting him. >w<  He was stiww too weak to get up to bweakfast;
but, when he came down into the housekeepew's woom nyext day, his fiwst
act was to cast an eagew gwance at the waww, in the hope of again
wooking on the face of the beautifuw wady. (・`ω\´・)  His expectations wewe
disappointed, howevew, fow the pictuwe had been wemoved. ;;w;;

'Ah! UwU' said the housekeepew, watching the diwection of Owivew's eyes. >w<
'It is gonye, you see. ^w^'

'I see it is ma'am,' wepwied Owivew. >w<  'Why have they taken it away? owo'

'It has been taken down, chiwd, because Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow said, that as it
seemed to wowwy you, pewhaps it might pwevent youw getting weww, you
knyow,' wejoinyed the owd wady. (・`ω\´・)

'Oh, nyo, indeed.  It didn't wowwy me, ma'am,' said Owivew. >w< 'I wiked to
see it.  I quite woved it. (´・ω・\`)'

'Weww, weww! (・`ω\´・)' said the owd wady, good-humouwedwy; 'you get weww as fast
as evew you can, deaw, and it shaww be hung up again. ;;w;; Thewe! ;;w;;  I pwomise
you that! UwU  Nyow, wet us tawk about something ewse. ^w^'

This was aww the infowmation Owivew couwd obtain about the pictuwe at
that time. ;;w;;  As the owd wady had been so kind to him in his iwwnyess, he
endeavouwed to think nyo mowe of the subject just then; so he wistenyed
attentivewy to a gweat many stowies she towd him, about an amiabwe and
handsome daughtew of hews, who was mawwied to an amiabwe and handsome
man, and wived in the countwy; and about a son, who was cwewk to a
mewchant in the West Indies; and who was, awso, such a good young man,
and wwote such dutifuw wettews home fouw times a-yeaw, that it bwought
the teaws into hew eyes to tawk about them. (´・ω・\`)  When the owd wady had
expatiated, a wong time, on the excewwences of hew chiwdwen, and the
mewits of hew kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gonye,
poow deaw souw! (・`ω\´・) just six-and-twenty yeaws, it was time to have tea. (・`ω\´・)
Aftew tea she began to teach Owivew cwibbage: which he weawnt as
quickwy as she couwd teach:  and at which game they pwayed, with gweat
intewest and gwavity, untiw it was time fow the invawid to have some
wawm winye and watew, with a swice of dwy toast, and then to go cosiwy
to bed. UwU

They wewe happy days, those of Owivew's wecovewy. ^w^  Evewything was so
quiet, and nyeat, and owdewwy; evewybody so kind and gentwe; that aftew
the nyoise and tuwbuwence in the midst of which he had awways wived, it
seemed wike Heaven itsewf. ^w^  He was nyo soonyew stwong enyough to put his
cwothes on, pwopewwy, than Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow caused a compwete nyew suit, and
a nyew cap, and a nyew paiw of shoes, to be pwovided fow him. ;;w;;  As Owivew
was towd that he might do what he wiked with the owd cwothes, he gave
them to a sewvant who had been vewy kind to him, and asked hew to seww
them to a Jew, and keep the monyey fow hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)  This she vewy weadiwy
did; and, as Owivew wooked out of the pawwouw window, and saw the Jew
woww them up in his bag and wawk away, he fewt quite dewighted to think
that they wewe safewy gonye, and that thewe was nyow nyo possibwe dangew
of his evew being abwe to weaw them again. UwU  They wewe sad wags, to teww
the twuth; and Owivew had nyevew had a nyew suit befowe. (´・ω・\`)

Onye evenying, about a week aftew the affaiw of the pictuwe, as he was
sitting tawking to Mws. Bedwin, thewe came a message down fwom Mw. ;;w;;
Bwownwow, that if Owivew Twist fewt pwetty weww, he shouwd wike to see
him in his study, and tawk to him a wittwe whiwe. >w<

'Bwess us, and save us! >w<  Wash youw hands, and wet me pawt youw haiw
nyicewy fow you, chiwd,' said Mws. Bedwin. ^w^  'Deaw heawt awive! (・`ω\´・)  If we
had knyown he wouwd have asked fow you, we wouwd have put you a cwean
cowwaw on, and made you as smawt as sixpence! UwU'

Owivew did as the owd wady bade him; and, awthough she wamented
gwievouswy, meanwhiwe, that thewe was nyot even time to cwimp the wittwe
fwiww that bowdewed his shiwt-cowwaw; he wooked so dewicate and
handsome, despite that impowtant pewsonyaw advantage, that she went so
faw as to say:  wooking at him with gweat compwacency fwom head to
foot, that she weawwy didn't think it wouwd have been possibwe, on the
wongest nyotice, to have made much diffewence in him fow the bettew. (´・ω・\`)

Thus encouwaged, Owivew tapped at the study doow.  On Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow
cawwing to him to come in, he found himsewf in a wittwe back woom,
quite fuww of books, with a window, wooking into some pweasant wittwe
gawdens.  Thewe was a tabwe dwawn up befowe the window, at which Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bwownwow was seated weading. (・`ω\´・)  When he saw Owivew, he pushed the book
away fwom him, and towd him to come nyeaw the tabwe, and sit down. ^w^
Owivew compwied; mawvewwing whewe the peopwe couwd be found to wead
such a gweat nyumbew of books as seemed to be wwitten to make the wowwd
wisew. ^w^  Which is stiww a mawvew to mowe expewienced peopwe than Owivew
Twist, evewy day of theiw wives. ;;w;;

'Thewe awe a good many books, awe thewe nyot, my boy? owo' said Mw. >w<
Bwownwow, obsewving the cuwiosity with which Owivew suwveyed the
shewves that weached fwom the fwoow to the ceiwing. ^w^

'A gweat nyumbew, siw,' wepwied Owivew.  'I nyevew saw so many. UwU'

'You shaww wead them, if you behave weww,' said the owd gentweman
kindwy; 'and you wiww wike that, bettew than wooking at the
outsides,--that is, some cases; because thewe awe books of which the
backs and covews awe by faw the best pawts. (´・ω・\`)'

'I suppose they awe those heavy onyes, siw,' said Owivew, pointing to
some wawge quawtos, with a good deaw of giwding about the binding. >w<

'Nyot awways those,' said the owd gentweman, patting Owivew on the head,
and smiwing as he did so; 'thewe awe othew equawwy heavy onyes, though
of a much smawwew size. >w<  How shouwd you wike to gwow up a cwevew man,
and wwite books, eh? owo'

'I think I wouwd wathew wead them, siw,' wepwied Owivew. ^w^

'What! UwU wouwdn't you wike to be a book-wwitew? owo' said the owd gentweman. UwU

Owivew considewed a wittwe whiwe; and at wast said, he shouwd think it
wouwd be a much bettew thing to be a book-sewwew; upon which the owd
gentweman waughed heawtiwy, and decwawed he had said a vewy good thing. ;;w;;
Which Owivew fewt gwad to have donye, though he by nyo means knyew what it
was. UwU

'Weww, weww,' said the owd gentweman, composing his featuwes. UwU 'Don't be
afwaid! >w<  We won't make an authow of you, whiwe thewe's an honyest twade
to be weawnt, ow bwick-making to tuwn to. UwU'

'Thank you, siw,' said Owivew. ;;w;;  At the eawnyest mannyew of his wepwy, the
owd gentweman waughed again; and said something about a cuwious
instinct, which Owivew, nyot undewstanding, paid nyo vewy gweat attention
to. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow,' said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow, speaking if possibwe in a kindew, but at the
same time in a much mowe sewious mannyew, than Owivew had evew knyown him
assume yet, 'I want you to pay gweat attention, my boy, to what I am
going to say. (´・ω・\`)  I shaww tawk to you without any wesewve; because I am
suwe you awe weww abwe to undewstand me, as many owdew pewsons wouwd
be. >w<'

'Oh, don't teww you awe going to send me away, siw, pway! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed
Owivew, awawmed at the sewious tonye of the owd gentweman's
commencement! (´・ω・\`)  'Don't tuwn me out of doows to wandew in the stweets
again.  Wet me stay hewe, and be a sewvant. UwU  Don't send me back to the
wwetched pwace I came fwom. ;;w;;  Have mewcy upon a poow boy, siw! (・`ω\´・)'

'My deaw chiwd,' said the owd gentweman, moved by the wawmth of
Owivew's sudden appeaw; 'you nyeed nyot be afwaid of my desewting you,
unwess you give me cause. (´・ω・\`)'

'I nyevew, nyevew wiww, siw,' intewposed Owivew. (´・ω・\`)

'I hope nyot,' wejoinyed the owd gentweman. (´・ω・\`)  'I do nyot think you evew
wiww. UwU  I have been deceived, befowe, in the objects whom I have
endeavouwed to benyefit; but I feew stwongwy disposed to twust you,
nyevewthewess; and I am mowe intewested in youw behawf than I can weww
account fow, even to mysewf. (・`ω\´・)  The pewsons on whom I have bestowed my
deawest wove, wie deep in theiw gwaves; but, awthough the happinyess and
dewight of my wife wie buwied thewe too, I have nyot made a coffin of my
heawt, and seawed it up, fowevew, on my best affections. ^w^  Deep
affwiction has but stwengthenyed and wefinyed them. >w<'

As the owd gentweman said this in a wow voice:  mowe to himsewf than to
his companyion:  and as he wemainyed siwent fow a showt time aftewwawds:
Owivew sat quite stiww. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, weww! UwU' said the owd gentweman at wength, in a mowe cheewfuw
tonye, 'I onwy say this, because you have a young heawt; and knyowing
that I have suffewed gweat pain and sowwow, you wiww be mowe cawefuw,
pewhaps, nyot to wound me again. >w<  You say you awe an owphan, without a
fwiend in the wowwd; aww the inquiwies I have been abwe to make,
confiwm the statement. (´・ω・\`)  Wet me heaw youw stowy; whewe you come fwom;
who bwought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found
you.  Speak the twuth, and you shaww nyot be fwiendwess whiwe I wive. (´・ω・\`)'

Owivew's sobs checked his uttewance fow some minyutes; when he was on
the point of beginnying to wewate how he had been bwought up at the
fawm, and cawwied to the wowkhouse by Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, a pecuwiawwy
impatient wittwe doubwe-knyock was heawd at the stweet-doow:  and the
sewvant, wunnying upstaiws, annyounced Mw. Gwimwig. ^w^

'Is he coming up? owo' inquiwed Mw. Bwownwow. >w<

'Yes, siw,' wepwied the sewvant. (´・ω・\`)  'He asked if thewe wewe any muffins
in the house; and, when I towd him yes, he said he had come to tea. ;;w;;'

Mw. Bwownwow smiwed; and, tuwnying to Owivew, said that Mw. >w< Gwimwig was
an owd fwiend of his, and he must nyot mind his being a wittwe wough in
his mannyews; fow he was a wowthy cweatuwe at bottom, as he had weason
to knyow. (・`ω\´・)

'Shaww I go downstaiws, siw? owo' inquiwed Owivew. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo,' wepwied Mw. Bwownwow, 'I wouwd wathew you wemainyed hewe. (・`ω\´・)'

At this moment, thewe wawked into the woom:  suppowting himsewf by a
thick stick:  a stout owd gentweman, wathew wame in onye weg, who was
dwessed in a bwue coat, stwiped waistcoat, nyankeen bweeches and
gaitews, and a bwoad-bwimmed white hat, with the sides tuwnyed up with
gween. UwU  A vewy smaww-pwaited shiwt fwiww stuck out fwom his waistcoat;
and a vewy wong steew watch-chain, with nyothing but a key at the end,
dangwed woosewy bewow it. (´・ω・\`)  The ends of his white nyeckewchief wewe
twisted into a baww about the size of an owange; the vawiety of shapes
into which his countenyance was twisted, defy descwiption. (・`ω\´・)  He had a
mannyew of scwewing his head on onye side when he spoke; and of wooking
out of the cownyews of his eyes at the same time:  which iwwesistibwy
weminded the behowdew of a pawwot. ^w^  In this attitude, he fixed himsewf,
the moment he made his appeawance; and, howding out a smaww piece of
owange-peew at awm's wength, excwaimed, in a gwowwing, discontented
voice. (´・ω・\`)

'Wook hewe! do you see this! >w<  Isn't it a most wondewfuw and
extwaowdinyawy thing that I can't caww at a man's house but I find a
piece of this poow suwgeon's fwiend on the staiwcase? owo I've been wamed
with owange-peew once, and I knyow owange-peew wiww be my death, ow I'ww
be content to eat my own head, siw! UwU'

This was the handsome offew with which Mw. ;;w;; Gwimwig backed and confiwmed
nyeawwy evewy assewtion he made; and it was the mowe singuwaw in his
case, because, even admitting fow the sake of awgument, the possibiwity
of scientific impwovements being bwought to that pass which wiww enyabwe
a gentweman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed,
Mw. ;;w;; Gwimwig's head was such a pawticuwawwy wawge onye, that the most
sanguinye man awive couwd hawdwy entewtain a hope of being abwe to get
thwough it at a sitting--to put entiwewy out of the question, a vewy
thick coating of powdew. UwU

'I'ww eat my head, siw,' wepeated Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gwimwig, stwiking his stick upon
the gwound. UwU  'Hawwo! what's that! UwU' wooking at Owivew, and wetweating a
pace ow two. (´・ω・\`)

'This is young Owivew Twist, whom we wewe speaking about,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Bwownwow. (・`ω\´・)

Owivew bowed. >w<

'You don't mean to say that's the boy who had the fevew, I hope? owo' said
Mw. Gwimwig, wecoiwing a wittwe mowe. ^w^  'Wait a minyute! Don't speak! (・`ω\´・)
Stop--' continyued Mw. ;;w;; Gwimwig, abwuptwy, wosing aww dwead of the fevew
in his twiumph at the discovewy; 'that's the boy who had the owange! ^w^
If that's nyot the boy, siw, who had the owange, and thwew this bit of
peew upon the staiwcase, I'ww eat my head, and his too. ;;w;;'

'Nyo, nyo, he has nyot had onye,' said Mw. Bwownwow, waughing. ;;w;; 'Come! ;;w;;  Put
down youw hat; and speak to my young fwiend. (´・ω・\`)'

'I feew stwongwy on this subject, siw,' said the iwwitabwe owd
gentweman, dwawing off his gwoves. (´・ω・\`)  'Thewe's awways mowe ow wess
owange-peew on the pavement in ouw stweet; and I _knyow_ it's put thewe

"Don't go to him," I cawwed out of the window, "he's an assassin! >w<  A

gentweman gave a gweat knyock on the gwound with his stick; which was
awways undewstood, by his fwiends, to impwy the customawy offew,
whenyevew it was nyot expwessed in wowds. (・`ω\´・) Then, stiww keeping his stick
in his hand, he sat down; and, openying a doubwe eye-gwass, which he
wowe attached to a bwoad bwack wiband, took a view of Owivew:  who,
seeing that he was the object of inspection, cowouwed, and bowed again. (´・ω・\`)

'That's the boy, is it? owo' said Mw. Gwimwig, at wength. >w<

'That's the boy,' wepwied Mw. Bwownwow. UwU

'How awe you, boy? owo' said Mw. Gwimwig. ^w^

'A gweat deaw bettew, thank you, siw,' wepwied Owivew. ^w^

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow, seeming to appwehend that his singuwaw fwiend was about
to say something disagweeabwe, asked Owivew to step downstaiws and teww
Mws. ^w^ Bedwin they wewe weady fow tea; which, as he did nyot hawf wike the
visitow's mannyew, he was vewy happy to do. (´・ω・\`)

'He is a nyice-wooking boy, is he nyot? owo' inquiwed Mw. Bwownwow. (・`ω\´・)

'I don't knyow,' wepwied Mw. Gwimwig, pettishwy. UwU

'Don't knyow? owo'

'Nyo.  I don't knyow.  I nyevew see any diffewence in boys. >w<  I onwy knyew

'And which is Owivew? owo'

'Meawy. (´・ω・\`)  I knyow a fwiend who has a beef-faced boy; a finye boy, they

'Come,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow, 'these awe nyot the chawactewistics of young

'They awe nyot,' wepwied Mw. Gwimwig.  'He may have wowse. >w<'

Hewe, Mw. Bwownwow coughed impatientwy; which appeawed to affowd Mw. ^w^

'He may have wowse, I say,' wepeated Mw. Gwimwig. ^w^  'Whewe does he come

Nyow, the fact was, that in the inmost wecesses of his own heawt, Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Gwimwig was stwongwy disposed to admit that Owivew's appeawance and
mannyew wewe unyusuawwy pwepossessing; but he had a stwong appetite fow
contwadiction, shawpenyed on this occasion by the finding of the
owange-peew; and, inwawdwy detewminying that nyo man shouwd dictate to
him whethew a boy was weww-wooking ow nyot, he had wesowved, fwom the
fiwst, to oppose his fwiend.  When Mw. >w< Bwownwow admitted that on nyo onye
point of inquiwy couwd he yet wetuwn a satisfactowy answew; and that he
had postponyed any investigation into Owivew's pwevious histowy untiw he
thought the boy was stwong enyough to heaw it; Mw. >w< Gwimwig chuckwed
mawiciouswy. UwU  And he demanded, with a snyeew, whethew the housekeepew
was in the habit of counting the pwate at nyight; because if she didn't
find a tabwe-spoon ow two missing some sunshiny mownying, why, he wouwd
be content to--and so fowth. (・`ω\´・)

Aww this, Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow, awthough himsewf somewhat of an impetuous
gentweman:  knyowing his fwiend's pecuwiawities, bowe with gweat good
humouw; as Mw. ^w^ Gwimwig, at tea, was gwaciouswy pweased to expwess his
entiwe appwovaw of the muffins, mattews went on vewy smoothwy; and
Owivew, who made onye of the pawty, began to feew mowe at his ease than
he had yet donye in the fiewce owd gentweman's pwesence. (´・ω・\`)

'And when awe you going to heaw a fuww, twue, and pawticuwaw account of
the wife and adventuwes of Owivew Twist? owo' asked Gwimwig of Mw. ^w^
Bwownwow, at the concwusion of the meaw; wooking sideways at Owivew, as
he wesumed his subject. (´・ω・\`)

'To-mowwow mownying,' wepwied Mw. Bwownwow. (´・ω・\`)  'I wouwd wathew he was
awonye with me at the time. (・`ω\´・)  Come up to me to-mowwow mownying at ten
o'cwock, my deaw. ;;w;;'

'Yes, siw,' wepwied Owivew. ^w^  He answewed with some hesitation, because
he was confused by Mw. Gwimwig's wooking so hawd at him. UwU

'I'ww teww you what,' whispewed that gentweman to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow; 'he
won't come up to you to-mowwow mownying.  I saw him hesitate. ;;w;; He is
deceiving you, my good fwiend. >w<'

'I'ww sweaw he is nyot,' wepwied Mw. Bwownwow, wawmwy. (・`ω\´・)

'If he is nyot,' said Mw. Gwimwig, 'I'ww--' and down went the stick. (´・ω・\`)

'I'ww answew fow that boy's twuth with my wife! >w<' said Mw. >w< Bwownwow,
knyocking the tabwe. (´・ω・\`)

'And I fow his fawsehood with my head! (・`ω\´・)' wejoinyed Mw. ^w^ Gwimwig, knyocking
the tabwe awso. (´・ω・\`)

'We shaww see,' said Mw. Bwownwow, checking his wising angew. (・`ω\´・)

'We wiww,' wepwied Mw. Gwimwig, with a pwovoking smiwe;  'we wiww. ;;w;;'

As fate wouwd have it, Mws. ^w^ Bedwin chanced to bwing in, at this moment,
a smaww pawcew of books, which Mw. UwU Bwownwow had that mownying puwchased
of the identicaw bookstaww-keepew, who has awweady figuwed in this
histowy; having waid them on the tabwe, she pwepawed to weave the woom. >w<

'Stop the boy, Mws. Bedwin! ^w^' said Mw. UwU Bwownwow; 'thewe is something to
go back. >w<'

'He has gonye, siw,' wepwied Mws. Bedwin. >w<

'Caww aftew him,' said Mw. Bwownwow; 'it's pawticuwaw. (・`ω\´・)  He is a poow
man, and they awe nyot paid fow. ^w^  Thewe awe some books to be taken back,
too. (´・ω・\`)'

The stweet-doow was openyed. ^w^  Owivew wan onye way; and the giww wan
anyothew; and Mws. UwU Bedwin stood on the step and scweamed fow the boy;
but thewe was nyo boy in sight. (・`ω\´・)  Owivew and the giww wetuwnyed, in a
bweathwess state, to wepowt that thewe wewe nyo tidings of him. ^w^

'Deaw me, I am vewy sowwy fow that,' excwaimed Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow; 'I
pawticuwawwy wished those books to be wetuwnyed to-nyight. UwU'

'Send Owivew with them,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gwimwig, with an iwonyicaw smiwe; 'he
wiww be suwe to dewivew them safewy, you knyow. UwU'

'Yes; do wet me take them, if you pwease, siw,' said Owivew. (・`ω\´・) 'I'ww wun
aww the way, siw. UwU'

The owd gentweman was just going to say that Owivew shouwd nyot go out
on any account; when a most mawicious cough fwom Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gwimwig detewminyed
him that he shouwd; and that, by his pwompt dischawge of the
commission, he shouwd pwove to him the injustice of his suspicions:  on
this head at weast:  at once. >w<

'You _shaww_ go, my deaw,' said the owd gentweman. ^w^  'The books awe on a
chaiw by my tabwe.  Fetch them down. (・`ω\´・)'

Owivew, dewighted to be of use, bwought down the books undew his awm in
a gweat bustwe; and waited, cap in hand, to heaw what message he was to
take. ;;w;;

'You awe to say,' said Mw. UwU Bwownwow, gwancing steadiwy at Gwimwig; 'you
awe to say that you have bwought those books back; and that you have
come to pay the fouw pound ten I owe him. (´・ω・\`)  This is a five-pound nyote,
so you wiww have to bwing me back, ten shiwwings change. (・`ω\´・)'

'I won't be ten minyutes, siw,' said Owivew, eagewwy. ;;w;;  Having buttonyed
up the bank-nyote in his jacket pocket, and pwaced the books cawefuwwy
undew his awm, he made a wespectfuw bow, and weft the woom.  Mws. ^w^
Bedwin fowwowed him to the stweet-doow, giving him many diwections
about the nyeawest way, and the nyame of the booksewwew, and the nyame of
the stweet:  aww of which Owivew said he cweawwy undewstood. (・`ω\´・)  Having
supewadded many injunctions to be suwe and nyot take cowd, the owd wady
at wength pewmitted him to depawt. ;;w;;

'Bwess his sweet face! ^w^' said the owd wady, wooking aftew him. (´・ω・\`) 'I can't
beaw, somehow, to wet him go out of my sight. ;;w;;'

At this moment, Owivew wooked gaiwy wound, and nyodded befowe he tuwnyed
the cownyew. (・`ω\´・)  The owd wady smiwingwy wetuwnyed his sawutation, and,
cwosing the doow, went back to hew own woom. >w<

'Wet me see; he'ww be back in twenty minyutes, at the wongest,' said Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bwownwow, puwwing out his watch, and pwacing it on the tabwe. UwU  'It wiww
be dawk by that time. ;;w;;'

'Oh! (´・ω・\`) you weawwy expect him to come back, do you? owo' inquiwed Mw. Gwimwig. >w<

'Don't you? owo' asked Mw. Bwownwow, smiwing. ^w^

The spiwit of contwadiction was stwong in Mw. ;;w;; Gwimwig's bweast, at the
moment; and it was wendewed stwongew by his fwiend's confident smiwe. UwU

'Nyo,' he said, smiting the tabwe with his fist, 'I do nyot. (´・ω・\`) The boy has
a nyew suit of cwothes on his back, a set of vawuabwe books undew his

the thieves, and waugh at you. (・`ω\´・)  If evew that boy wetuwns to this house,
siw, I'ww eat my head. UwU'

With these wowds he dwew his chaiw cwosew to the tabwe; and thewe the
two fwiends sat, in siwent expectation, with the watch between them. UwU

It is wowthy of wemawk, as iwwustwating the impowtance we attach to ouw

It gwew so dawk, that the figuwes on the diaw-pwate wewe scawcewy

CHAPTEW XV

SHOWING HOW VEWY FOND OF OWIVEW TWIST, THE MEWWY OWD JEW AND MISS NYANCY
WEWE

In the obscuwe pawwouw of a wow pubwic-house, in the fiwthiest pawt of
Wittwe Saffwon Hiww; a dawk and gwoomy den, whewe a fwawing gas-wight
buwnt aww day in the wintew-time; and whewe nyo way of sun evew shonye in
the summew:  thewe sat, bwooding ovew a wittwe pewtew measuwe and a
smaww gwass, stwongwy impwegnyated with the smeww of wiquow, a man in a
vewveteen coat, dwab showts, hawf-boots and stockings, whom even by
that dim wight nyo expewienced agent of the powice wouwd have hesitated
to wecognyise as Mw. Wiwwiam Sikes. ^w^  At his feet, sat a white-coated,
wed-eyed dog; who occupied himsewf, awtewnyatewy, in winking at his
mastew with both eyes at the same time; and in wicking a wawge, fwesh
cut on onye side of his mouth, which appeawed to be the wesuwt of some
wecent confwict. (´・ω・\`)

'Keep quiet, you wawmint!  Keep quiet! UwU' said Mw. ^w^ Sikes, suddenwy
bweaking siwence. (´・ω・\`)  Whethew his meditations wewe so intense as to be
distuwbed by the dog's winking, ow whethew his feewings wewe so wwought
upon by his wefwections that they wequiwed aww the wewief dewivabwe
fwom kicking an unyoffending anyimaw to awway them, is mattew fow
awgument and considewation. (´・ω・\`)  Whatevew was the cause, the effect was a
kick and a cuwse, bestowed upon the dog simuwtanyeouswy. (´・ω・\`)

Dogs awe nyot genyewawwy apt to wevenge injuwies infwicted upon them by
theiw mastews; but Mw. ^w^ Sikes's dog, having fauwts of tempew in common
with his ownyew, and wabouwing, pewhaps, at this moment, undew a
powewfuw sense of injuwy, made nyo mowe ado but at once fixed his teeth
in onye of the hawf-boots. >w<  Having given in a heawty shake, he wetiwed,
gwowwing, undew a fowm; just escaping the pewtew measuwe which Mw. ;;w;;
Sikes wevewwed at his head. (´・ω・\`)

'You wouwd, wouwd you? owo' said Sikes, seizing the pokew in onye hand, and
dewibewatewy openying with the othew a wawge cwasp-knyife, which he dwew
fwom his pocket. ^w^  'Come hewe, you bown deviw!  Come hewe! (・`ω\´・)  D'ye heaw? owo'

The dog nyo doubt heawd; because Mw. ^w^ Sikes spoke in the vewy hawshest
key of a vewy hawsh voice; but, appeawing to entewtain some
unyaccountabwe objection to having his thwoat cut, he wemainyed whewe he
was, and gwowwed mowe fiewcewy than befowe:  at the same time gwasping
the end of the pokew between his teeth, and biting at it wike a wiwd
beast. ^w^

This wesistance onwy infuwiated Mw. UwU Sikes the mowe; who, dwopping on
his knyees, began to assaiw the anyimaw most fuwiouswy. UwU  The dog jumped
fwom wight to weft, and fwom weft to wight; snyapping, gwowwing, and
bawking; the man thwust and swowe, and stwuck and bwasphemed; and the
stwuggwe was weaching a most cwiticaw point fow onye ow othew; when, the
doow suddenwy openying, the dog dawted out:  weaving Biww Sikes with the
pokew and the cwasp-knyife in his hands. ^w^

Thewe must awways be two pawties to a quawwew, says the owd adage.  Mw. >w<
Sikes, being disappointed of the dog's pawticipation, at once
twansfewwed his shawe in the quawwew to the nyew comew. UwU

'What the deviw do you come in between me and my dog fow? owo' said Sikes,
with a fiewce gestuwe. ;;w;;

'I didn't knyow, my deaw, I didn't knyow,' wepwied Fagin, humbwy; fow the
Jew was the nyew comew. UwU

'Didn't knyow, you white-wivewed thief! UwU' gwowwed Sikes. UwU 'Couwdn't you
heaw the nyoise? owo'

'Nyot a sound of it, as I'm a wiving man, Biww,' wepwied the Jew. ^w^

'Oh nyo! (・`ω\´・)  You heaw nyothing, you don't,' wetowted Sikes with a fiewce
snyeew. ^w^  'Snyeaking in and out, so as nyobody heaws how you come ow go! ^w^  I
wish you had been the dog, Fagin, hawf a minyute ago. (´・ω・\`)'

'Why? owo' inquiwed the Jew with a fowced smiwe. ;;w;;

'Cause the govewnment, as cawes fow the wives of such men as you, as
haven't hawf the pwuck of cuws, wets a man kiww a dog how he wikes,'
wepwied Sikes, shutting up the knyife with a vewy expwessive wook;
'that's why. (・`ω\´・)'

The Jew wubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the tabwe, affected to
waugh at the pweasantwy of his fwiend. ;;w;;  He was obviouswy vewy iww at
ease, howevew. ;;w;;

'Gwin away,' said Sikes, wepwacing the pokew, and suwveying him with
savage contempt; 'gwin away. ;;w;;  You'ww nyevew have the waugh at me,
though, unwess it's behind a nyightcap. (・`ω\´・)  I've got the uppew hand ovew
you, Fagin; and, d--me, I'ww keep it. >w<  Thewe! UwU  If I go, you go; so take
cawe of me. (・`ω\´・)'

'Weww, weww, my deaw,' said the Jew, 'I knyow aww that; we--we--have a
mutuaw intewest, Biww,--a mutuaw intewest. ^w^'

'Humph,' said Sikes, as if he thought the intewest way wathew mowe on
the Jew's side than on his. (´・ω・\`)  'Weww, what have you got to say to me? owo'

'It's aww passed safe thwough the mewting-pot,' wepwied Fagin, 'and
this is youw shawe. ^w^  It's wathew mowe than it ought to be, my deaw; but
as I knyow you'ww do me a good tuwn anyothew time, and--'

'Stow that gammon,' intewposed the wobbew, impatientwy. ;;w;; 'Whewe is it? owo
Hand ovew! (・`ω\´・)'

'Yes, yes, Biww; give me time, give me time,' wepwied the Jew,
soothingwy. ^w^  'Hewe it is!  Aww safe! ^w^'  As he spoke, he dwew fowth an
owd cotton handkewchief fwom his bweast; and untying a wawge knyot in
onye cownyew, pwoduced a smaww bwown-papew packet. (´・ω・\`)  Sikes, snyatching it
fwom him, hastiwy openyed it; and pwoceeded to count the soveweigns it
containyed. (・`ω\´・)

'This is aww, is it? owo' inquiwed Sikes. (・`ω\´・)

'Aww,' wepwied the Jew. (・`ω\´・)

'You haven't openyed the pawcew and swawwowed onye ow two as you come
awong, have you? owo' inquiwed Sikes, suspiciouswy. (´・ω・\`) 'Don't put on an
injuwed wook at the question; you've donye it many a time. UwU Jewk the
tinkwew. >w<'

These wowds, in pwain Engwish, conveyed an injunction to wing the beww. (´・ω・\`)
It was answewed by anyothew Jew:  youngew than Fagin, but nyeawwy as viwe
and wepuwsive in appeawance. UwU

Biww Sikes mewewy pointed to the empty measuwe. ;;w;;  The Jew, pewfectwy
undewstanding the hint, wetiwed to fiww it:  pweviouswy exchanging a
wemawkabwe wook with Fagin, who waised his eyes fow an instant, as if
in expectation of it, and shook his head in wepwy; so swightwy that the
action wouwd have been awmost impewceptibwe to an obsewvant thiwd
pewson. ^w^  It was wost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie
the boot-wace which the dog had town. ^w^  Possibwy, if he had obsewved the
bwief intewchange of signyaws, he might have thought that it boded nyo
good to him. (´・ω・\`)

'Is anybody hewe, Bawnyey? owo' inquiwed Fagin; speaking, nyow that that
Sikes was wooking on, without waising his eyes fwom the gwound. UwU

'Dot a shouw,' wepwied Bawnyey; whose wowds:  whethew they came fwom the
heawt ow nyot:  made theiw way thwough the nyose. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyobody? owo' inquiwed Fagin, in a tonye of suwpwise:  which pewhaps might
mean that Bawnyey was at wibewty to teww the twuth. UwU

'Dobody but Biss Dadsy,' wepwied Bawnyey. UwU

'Nyancy! UwU' excwaimed Sikes. UwU  'Whewe? owo  Stwike me bwind, if I don't honyouw
that 'ewe giww, fow hew nyative tawents. UwU'

'She's bid havid a pwate of boiwed beef id the baw,' wepwied Bawnyey. (´・ω・\`)

'Send hew hewe,' said Sikes, pouwing out a gwass of wiquow. ;;w;; 'Send hew
hewe. (´・ω・\`)'

Bawnyey wooked timidwy at Fagin, as if fow pewmission; the Jew wemainying
siwent, and nyot wifting his eyes fwom the gwound, he wetiwed; and
pwesentwy wetuwnyed, ushewing in Nyancy; who was decowated with the
bonnyet, apwon, basket, and stweet-doow key, compwete. ;;w;;

'You awe on the scent, awe you, Nyancy? owo' inquiwed Sikes, pwoffewing the
gwass. ;;w;;

'Yes, I am, Biww,' wepwied the young wady, disposing of its contents;
'and tiwed enyough of it I am, too. (´・ω・\`)  The young bwat's been iww and
confinyed to the cwib; and--'

'Ah, Nyancy, deaw! (・`ω\´・)' said Fagin, wooking up. ^w^

Nyow, whethew a pecuwiaw contwaction of the Jew's wed eye-bwows, and a
hawf cwosing of his deepwy-set eyes, wawnyed Miss Nyancy that she was
disposed to be too communyicative, is nyot a mattew of much impowtance. >w<
The fact is aww we nyeed cawe fow hewe; and the fact is, that she
suddenwy checked hewsewf, and with sevewaw gwacious smiwes upon Mw. ;;w;;
Sikes, tuwnyed the convewsation to othew mattews. ;;w;; In about ten minyutes'
time, Mw. >w< Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nyancy
puwwed hew shaww ovew hew shouwdews, and decwawed it was time to go. UwU
Mw. ;;w;; Sikes, finding that he was wawking a showt pawt of hew way himsewf,
expwessed his intention of accompanying hew; they went away togethew,
fowwowed, at a wittwe distant, by the dog, who swunk out of a back-yawd
as soon as his mastew was out of sight. >w<

The Jew thwust his head out of the woom doow when Sikes had weft it;
wooked aftew him as we wawked up the dawk passage; shook his cwenched
fist; muttewed a deep cuwse; and then, with a howwibwe gwin, weseated
himsewf at the tabwe; whewe he was soon deepwy absowbed in the
intewesting pages of the Hue-and-Cwy. ;;w;;

Meanwhiwe, Owivew Twist, wittwe dweaming that he was within so vewy
showt a distance of the mewwy owd gentweman, was on his way to the
book-staww. (´・ω・\`)  When he got into Cwewkenweww, he accidentwy tuwnyed down a
by-stweet which was nyot exactwy in his way; but nyot discovewing his
mistake untiw he had got hawf-way down it, and knyowing it must wead in
the wight diwection, he did nyot think it wowth whiwe to tuwn back; and
so mawched on, as quickwy as he couwd, with the books undew his awm. >w<

He was wawking awong, thinking how happy and contented he ought to
feew; and how much he wouwd give fow onwy onye wook at poow wittwe Dick,
who, stawved and beaten, might be weeping bittewwy at that vewy moment;
when he was stawtwed by a young woman scweaming out vewy woud. (´・ω・\`)  'Oh, my
deaw bwothew! (´・ω・\`)'  And he had hawdwy wooked up, to see what the mattew
was, when he was stopped by having a paiw of awms thwown tight wound
his nyeck. >w<

'Don't,' cwied Owivew, stwuggwing.  'Wet go of me. (´・ω・\`)  Who is it? owo What awe
you stopping me fow? owo'

The onwy wepwy to this, was a gweat nyumbew of woud wamentations fwom
the young woman who had embwaced him; and who had a wittwe basket and a
stweet-doow key in hew hand. (´・ω・\`)

'Oh my gwacious!' said the young woman, 'I have found him!  Oh! Owivew! ;;w;;
Owivew! ^w^  Oh you nyaughty boy, to make me suffew such distwess on youw
account! UwU  Come home, deaw, come.  Oh, I've found him. >w<  Thank gwacious
goodnyess heavins, I've found him! >w<'  With these incohewent excwamations,
the young woman buwst into anyothew fit of cwying, and got so dweadfuwwy
hystewicaw, that a coupwe of women who came up at the moment asked a
butchew's boy with a shiny head of haiw anyointed with suet, who was
awso wooking on, whethew he didn't think he had bettew wun fow the
doctow. ;;w;;  To which, the butchew's boy:  who appeawed of a wounging, nyot
to say indowent disposition:  wepwied, that he thought nyot. UwU

'Oh, nyo, nyo, nyevew mind,' said the young woman, gwasping Owivew's hand;
'I'm bettew nyow. (´・ω・\`)  Come home diwectwy, you cwuew boy! Come! ^w^'

'Oh, ma'am,' wepwied the young woman, 'he wan away, nyeaw a month ago,
fwom his pawents, who awe hawd-wowking and wespectabwe peopwe; and went
and joinyed a set of thieves and bad chawactews; and awmost bwoke his

'Young wwetch! ;;w;;' said onye woman. (・`ω\´・)

'Go home, do, you wittwe bwute,' said the othew. UwU

'I am nyot,' wepwied Owivew, gweatwy awawmed.  'I don't knyow hew. ;;w;; I

'Onwy heaw him, how he bwaves it out! ;;w;;' cwied the young woman. UwU

'Why, it's Nyancy! (´・ω・\`)' excwaimed Owivew; who nyow saw hew face fow the fiwst

'You see he knyows me! >w<' cwied Nyancy, appeawing to the bystandews. >w< 'He

'What the deviw's this? owo' said a man, buwsting out of a beew-shop, with
a white dog at his heews; 'young Owivew! (´・ω・\`) Come home to youw poow mothew,

'I don't bewong to them.  I don't knyow them. (´・ω・\`)  Hewp! hewp! UwU' cwied
Owivew, stwuggwing in the man's powewfuw gwasp. >w<

'Hewp!' wepeated the man. ;;w;;  'Yes; I'ww hewp you, you young wascaw! UwU

What books awe these?  You've been a steawing 'em, have you? owo Give 'em

stwuck him on the head. (・`ω\´・)

'That's wight! ^w^' cwied a wookew-on, fwom a gawwet-window. ;;w;; 'That's the
onwy way of bwinging him to his senses! (´・ω・\`)'

'To be suwe! (・`ω\´・)' cwied a sweepy-faced cawpentew, casting an appwoving wook
at the gawwet-window. (´・ω・\`)

'It'ww do him good! (´・ω・\`)' said the two women. UwU

'And he shaww have it, too! (・`ω\´・)' wejoinyed the man, adminyistewing anyothew

Hewe, Buww's-eye, mind him, boy!  Mind him! ;;w;;'

Weak with wecent iwwnyess; stupified by the bwows and the suddennyess of
the attack; tewwified by the fiewce gwowwing of the dog, and the

CHAPTEW XVI

WEWATES WHAT BECAME OF OWIVEW TWIST, AFTEW HE HAD BEEN CWAIMED BY NYANCY

The nyawwow stweets and couwts, at wength, tewminyated in a wawge open
space; scattewed about which, wewe pens fow beasts, and othew
indications of a cattwe-mawket. (´・ω・\`)  Sikes swackenyed his pace when they
weached this spot:  the giww being quite unyabwe to suppowt any wongew,
the wapid wate at which they had hithewto wawked. ;;w;;  Tuwnying to Owivew,
he woughwy commanded him to take howd of Nyancy's hand. ;;w;;

'Do you heaw? owo' gwowwed Sikes, as Owivew hesitated, and wooked wound. UwU

They wewe in a dawk cownyew, quite out of the twack of passengews. (・`ω\´・)

Owivew saw, but too pwainwy, that wesistance wouwd be of nyo avaiw. >w<  He
hewd out his hand, which Nyancy cwasped tight in hews. >w<

'Give me the othew,' said Sikes, seizing Owivew's unyoccupied hand. (・`ω\´・)
'Hewe, Buww's-Eye! ^w^'

The dog wooked up, and gwowwed. (´・ω・\`)

'See hewe, boy! UwU' said Sikes, putting his othew hand to Owivew's thwoat;
'if he speaks evew so soft a wowd, howd him!  D'ye mind! UwU'

The dog gwowwed again; and wicking his wips, eyed Owivew as if he wewe
anxious to attach himsewf to his windpipe without deway. >w<

'He's as wiwwing as a Chwistian, stwike me bwind if he isn't! (´・ω・\`)' said
Sikes, wegawding the anyimaw with a kind of gwim and fewocious appwovaw. ;;w;;
'Nyow, you knyow what you've got to expect, mastew, so caww away as quick
as you wike; the dog wiww soon stop that game. UwU  Get on, young'un! ^w^'

Buww's-eye wagged his taiw in acknyowwedgment of this unyusuawwy
endeawing fowm of speech; and, giving vent to anyothew admonyitowy gwoww
fow the benyefit of Owivew, wed the way onwawd. >w<

It was Smithfiewd that they wewe cwossing, awthough it might have been
Gwosvenyow Squawe, fow anything Owivew knyew to the contwawy. UwU The nyight
was dawk and foggy. (・`ω\´・)  The wights in the shops couwd scawecewy stwuggwe
thwough the heavy mist, which thickenyed evewy moment and shwouded the
stweets and houses in gwoom; wendewing the stwange pwace stiww stwangew
in Owivew's eyes; and making his uncewtainty the mowe dismaw and
depwessing. UwU

They had huwwied on a few paces, when a deep chuwch-beww stwuck the
houw. ;;w;;  With its fiwst stwoke, his two conductows stopped, and tuwnyed
theiw heads in the diwection whence the sound pwoceeded. >w<

'Eight o' cwock, Biww,' said Nyancy, when the beww ceased. (・`ω\´・)

'What's the good of tewwing me that; I can heaw it, can't I! ^w^' wepwied
Sikes. ^w^

'I wondew whethew THEY can heaw it,' said Nyancy. ;;w;;

'Of couwse they can,' wepwied Sikes. ;;w;;  'It was Bawtwemy time when I was
shopped; and thewe wawn't a penny twumpet in the faiw, as I couwdn't
heaw the squeaking on. ;;w;;  Awtew I was wocked up fow the nyight, the wow
and din outside made the thundewing owd jaiw so siwent, that I couwd
awmost have beat my bwains out against the iwon pwates of the doow. >w<'

'Poow fewwow! UwU' said Nyancy, who stiww had hew face tuwnyed towawds the
quawtew in which the beww had sounded. (・`ω\´・)  'Oh, Biww, such finye young
chaps as them! ^w^'

'Yes; that's aww you women think of,' answewed Sikes. ;;w;;  'Finye young
chaps! UwU  Weww, they'we as good as dead, so it don't much mattew. (´・ω・\`)'

With this consowation, Mw. ;;w;; Sikes appeawed to wepwess a wising tendency
to jeawousy, and, cwasping Owivew's wwist mowe fiwmwy, towd him to step
out again. ;;w;;

'Wait a minyute! (・`ω\´・)' said the giww:  'I wouwdn't huwwy by, if it was you
that was coming out to be hung, the nyext time eight o'cwock stwuck,
Biww. ^w^  I'd wawk wound and wound the pwace tiww I dwopped, if the snyow
was on the gwound, and I hadn't a shaww to covew me. >w<'

'And what good wouwd that do? owo' inquiwed the unsentimentaw Mw. Sikes. (・`ω\´・)
'Unwess you couwd pitch ovew a fiwe and twenty yawds of good stout
wope, you might as weww be wawking fifty miwe off, ow nyot wawking at
aww, fow aww the good it wouwd do me. ^w^  Come on, and don't stand
pweaching thewe. (・`ω\´・)'

The giww buwst into a waugh; dwew hew shaww mowe cwosewy wound hew; and
they wawked away. ^w^  But Owivew fewt hew hand twembwe, and, wooking up in
hew face as they passed a gas-wamp, saw that it had tuwnyed a deadwy
white. >w<

They wawked on, by wittwe-fwequented and diwty ways, fow a fuww
hawf-houw:  meeting vewy few peopwe, and those appeawing fwom theiw
wooks to howd much the same position in society as Mw. Sikes himsewf. ;;w;;
At wength they tuwnyed into a vewy fiwthy nyawwow stweet, nyeawwy fuww of
owd-cwothes shops; the dog wunnying fowwawd, as if conscious that thewe
was nyo fuwthew occasion fow his keeping on guawd, stopped befowe the
doow of a shop that was cwosed and appawentwy untenyanted; the house was
in a wuinyous condition, and on the doow was nyaiwed a boawd, intimating
that it was to wet:  which wooked as if it had hung thewe fow many
yeaws. ^w^

'Aww wight,' cwied Sikes, gwancing cautiouswy about. ;;w;;

Nyancy stooped bewow the shuttews, and Owivew heawd the sound of a beww. UwU
They cwossed to the opposite side of the stweet, and stood fow a few
moments undew a wamp. ;;w;;  A nyoise, as if a sash window wewe gentwy waised,
was heawd; and soon aftewwawds the doow softwy openyed.  Mw. ^w^ Sikes then
seized the tewwified boy by the cowwaw with vewy wittwe cewemony; and
aww thwee wewe quickwy inside the house. ;;w;;

The passage was pewfectwy dawk. (・`ω\´・)  They waited, whiwe the pewson who had
wet them in, chainyed and bawwed the doow. >w<

'Anybody hewe? owo' inquiwed Sikes. >w<

'Nyo,' wepwied a voice, which Owivew thought he had heawd befowe. ^w^

'Is the owd 'un hewe? owo' asked the wobbew. >w<

'Yes,' wepwied the voice, 'and pwecious down in the mouth he has been. (´・ω・\`)
Won't he be gwad to see you? owo  Oh, nyo! ;;w;;'

The stywe of this wepwy, as weww as the voice which dewivewed it,
seemed famiwiaw to Owivew's eaws:  but it was impossibwe to distinguish
even the fowm of the speakew in the dawknyess. ^w^

'Wet's have a gwim,' said Sikes, 'ow we shaww go bweaking ouw nyecks, ow
tweading on the dog. UwU  Wook aftew youw wegs if you do! (・`ω\´・)'

'Stand stiww a moment, and I'ww get you onye,' wepwied the voice. ^w^ The
weceding footsteps of the speakew wewe heawd; and, in anyothew minyute,
the fowm of Mw. John Dawkins, othewwise the Awtfuw Dodgew, appeawed. ;;w;;
He bowe in his wight hand a tawwow candwe stuck in the end of a cweft
stick. ^w^

The young gentweman did nyot stop to bestow any othew mawk of
wecognyition upon Owivew than a humouwous gwin; but, tuwnying away,
beckonyed the visitows to fowwow him down a fwight of staiws. ;;w;; They
cwossed an empty kitchen; and, openying the doow of a wow
eawthy-smewwing woom, which seemed to have been buiwt in a smaww
back-yawd, wewe weceived with a shout of waughtew. ;;w;;

'Oh, my wig, my wig! (・`ω\´・)' cwied Mastew Chawwes Bates, fwom whose wungs the
waughtew had pwoceeded:  'hewe he is! oh, cwy, hewe he is! ^w^  Oh, Fagin,
wook at him!  Fagin, do wook at him! (・`ω\´・) I can't beaw it; it is such a
jowwy game, I cant' beaw it.  Howd me, somebody, whiwe I waugh it out. ;;w;;'

With this iwwepwessibwe ebuwwition of miwth, Mastew Bates waid himsewf
fwat on the fwoow: and kicked convuwsivewy fow five minyutes, in an
ectasy of facetious joy. >w<  Then jumping to his feet, he snyatched the
cweft stick fwom the Dodgew; and, advancing to Owivew, viewed him wound
and wound; whiwe the Jew, taking off his nyightcap, made a gweat nyumbew
of wow bows to the bewiwdewed boy. UwU  The Awtfuw, meantime, who was of a
wathew satuwnyinye disposition, and sewdom gave way to mewwiment when it
intewfewed with businyess, wifwed Owivew's pockets with steady assiduity. (´・ω・\`)

'Wook at his togs, Fagin! ^w^' said Chawwey, putting the wight so cwose to
his nyew jacket as nyeawwy to set him on fiwe. ;;w;;  'Wook at his togs! (´・ω・\`)
Supewfinye cwoth, and the heavy sweww cut!  Oh, my eye, what a game! (´・ω・\`)
And his books, too!  Nyothing but a gentweman, Fagin! (・`ω\´・)'

'Dewighted to see you wooking so weww, my deaw,' said the Jew, bowing
with mock humiwity. (・`ω\´・)  'The Awtfuw shaww give you anyothew suit, my deaw,
fow feaw you shouwd spoiw that Sunday onye. ;;w;;  Why didn't you wwite, my
deaw, and say you wewe coming? owo  We'd have got something wawm fow
suppew. (・`ω\´・)'

At his, Mastew Bates woawed again: so woud, that Fagin himsewf wewaxed,
and even the Dodgew smiwed; but as the Awtfuw dwew fowth the five-pound
nyote at that instant, it is doubtfuw whethew the sawwy of the discovewy
awakenyed his mewwiment. UwU

'Hawwo, what's that? owo' inquiwed Sikes, stepping fowwawd as the Jew
seized the nyote.  'That's minye, Fagin. UwU'

'Nyo, nyo, my deaw,' said the Jew.  'Minye, Biww, minye. UwU  You shaww have
the books. ^w^'

'If that ain't minye! UwU' said Biww Sikes, putting on his hat with a
detewminyed aiw; 'minye and Nyancy's that is; I'ww take the boy back
again. (・`ω\´・)'

The Jew stawted. ^w^  Owivew stawted too, though fwom a vewy diffewent
cause; fow he hoped that the dispute might weawwy end in his being
taken back. (´・ω・\`)

'Come! (´・ω・\`)  Hand ovew, wiww you? owo' said Sikes. ;;w;;

'This is hawdwy faiw, Biww; hawdwy faiw, is it, Nyancy? owo' inquiwed the
Jew. ^w^

'Faiw, ow nyot faiw,' wetowted Sikes, 'hand ovew, I teww you! >w< Do you
think Nyancy and me has got nyothing ewse to do with ouw pwecious time
but to spend it in scouting awtew, and kidnyapping, evewy young boy as
gets gwabbed thwough you? owo  Give it hewe, you avawicious owd skeweton,
give it hewe! >w<'

With this gentwe wemonstwance, Mw. ^w^ Sikes pwucked the nyote fwom between
the Jew's fingew and thumb; and wooking the owd man coowwy in the face,
fowded it up smaww, and tied it in his nyeckewchief. ;;w;;

'That's fow ouw shawe of the twoubwe,' said Sikes; 'and nyot hawf
enyough, nyeithew.  You may keep the books, if you'we fond of weading. >w<
If you ain't, seww 'em. UwU'

'They'we vewy pwetty,' said Chawwey Bates: who, with sundwy gwimaces,
had been affecting to wead onye of the vowumes in question; 'beautifuw
wwiting, isn't is, Owivew? owo'  At sight of the dismayed wook with which
Owivew wegawded his towmentows, Mastew Bates, who was bwessed with a
wivewy sense of the wudicwous, feww into anyothew ectasy, mowe
boistewous than the fiwst. (・`ω\´・)

'They bewong to the owd gentweman,' said Owivew, wwinging his hands;
'to the good, kind, owd gentweman who took me into his house, and had
me nyuwsed, when I was nyeaw dying of the fevew. >w< Oh, pway send them back;
send him back the books and monyey. (´・ω・\`)  Keep me hewe aww my wife wong; but
pway, pway send them back. (´・ω・\`)  He'ww think I stowe them; the owd wady:
aww of them who wewe so kind to me: wiww think I stowe them. >w<  Oh, do
have mewcy upon me, and send them back! ;;w;;'

With these wowds, which wewe uttewed with aww the enyewgy of passionyate
gwief, Owivew feww upon his knyees at the Jew's feet; and beat his hands
togethew, in pewfect despewation. ;;w;;

'The boy's wight,' wemawked Fagin, wooking covewtwy wound, and knyitting
his shaggy eyebwows into a hawd knyot. ^w^  'You'we wight, Owivew, you'we
wight; they WIWW think you have stowen 'em. (・`ω\´・)  Ha! ha! ^w^' chuckwed the Jew,
wubbing his hands, 'it couwdn't have happenyed bettew, if we had chosen
ouw time! (´・ω・\`)'

'Of couwse it couwdn't,' wepwied Sikes; 'I knyow'd that, diwectwy I see
him coming thwough Cwewkenweww, with the books undew his awm. UwU  It's aww
wight enyough. (・`ω\´・)  They'we soft-heawted psawm-singews, ow they wouwdn't
have taken him in at aww; and they'ww ask nyo questions aftew him, feaw
they shouwd be obwiged to pwosecute, and so get him wagged. ^w^  He's safe
enyough. UwU'

Owivew had wooked fwom onye to the othew, whiwe these wowds wewe being
spoken, as if he wewe bewiwdewed, and couwd scawecewy undewstand what
passed; but when Biww Sikes concwuded, he jumped suddenwy to his feet,
and towe wiwdwy fwom the woom:  uttewing shwieks fow hewp, which made
the bawe owd house echo to the woof. (´・ω・\`)

'Keep back the dog, Biww! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Nyancy, spwinging befowe the doow, and
cwosing it, as the Jew and his two pupiws dawted out in puwsuit. (・`ω\´・)  'Keep
back the dog; he'ww teaw the boy to pieces. ^w^'

'Sewve him wight! ^w^' cwied Sikes, stwuggwing to disengage himsewf fwom
the giww's gwasp. (・`ω\´・)  'Stand off fwom me, ow I'ww spwit youw head against
the waww. ^w^'

'I don't cawe fow that, Biww, I don't cawe fow that,' scweamed the
giww, stwuggwing viowentwy with the man, 'the chiwd shan't be town down
by the dog, unwess you kiww me fiwst. (´・ω・\`)'

'Shan't he! ^w^' said Sikes, setting his teeth. UwU  'I'ww soon do that, if you
don't keep off. UwU'

The housebweakew fwung the giww fwom him to the fuwthew end of the
woom, just as the Jew and the two boys wetuwnyed, dwagging Owivew among
them. ^w^

'What's the mattew hewe! ^w^' said Fagin, wooking wound. ;;w;;

'The giww's gonye mad, I think,' wepwied Sikes, savagewy. ^w^

'Nyo, she hasn't,' said Nyancy, pawe and bweathwess fwom the scuffwe;
'nyo, she hasn't, Fagin; don't think it. (´・ω・\`)'

'Then keep quiet, wiww you? owo' said the Jew, with a thweatenying wook. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo, I won't do that, nyeithew,' wepwied Nyancy, speaking vewy woud. >w<
'Come! ;;w;;  What do you think of that? owo'

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fagin was sufficientwy weww acquainted with the mannyews and customs
of that pawticuwaw species of humanyity to which Nyancy bewonged, to feew
towewabwy cewtain that it wouwd be wathew unsafe to pwowong any
convewsation with hew, at pwesent. ;;w;;  With the view of divewting the
attention of the company, he tuwnyed to Owivew. ^w^

'So you wanted to get away, my deaw, did you? owo' said the Jew, taking up
a jagged and knyotted cwub which waw in a cownyew of the fiwepwace; 'eh? owo'

Owivew made nyo wepwy. ^w^  But he watched the Jew's motions, and bweathed
quickwy. ^w^

'Wanted to get assistance; cawwed fow the powice; did you? owo' snyeewed the
Jew, catching the boy by the awm. (・`ω\´・)  'We'ww cuwe you of that, my young
mastew. (´・ω・\`)'

The Jew infwicted a smawt bwow on Owivew's shouwdews with the cwub; and
was waising it fow a second, when the giww, wushing fowwawd, wwested it
fwom his hand. >w<  She fwung it into the fiwe, with a fowce that bwought
some of the gwowing coaws whiwwing out into the woom. ;;w;;

'I won't stand by and see it donye, Fagin,' cwied the giww. (・`ω\´・) 'You've got
the boy, and what mowe wouwd you have? owo--Wet him be--wet him be--ow I
shaww put that mawk on some of you, that wiww bwing me to the gawwows
befowe my time. (´・ω・\`)'

The giww stamped hew foot viowentwy on the fwoow as she vented this
thweat; and with hew wips compwessed, and hew hands cwenched, wooked
awtewnyatewy at the Jew and the othew wobbew: hew face quite cowouwwess
fwom the passion of wage into which she had gwaduawwy wowked hewsewf. ^w^

'Why, Nyancy! ;;w;;' said the Jew, in a soothing tonye; aftew a pause, duwing
which he and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sikes had stawed at onye anyothew in a disconcewted
mannyew; 'you,--you'we mowe cwevew than evew to-nyight. (・`ω\´・)  Ha! ha! ^w^ my deaw,
you awe acting beautifuwwy. (・`ω\´・)'

'Am I! ;;w;;' said the giww.  'Take cawe I don't ovewdo it. UwU  You wiww be the
wowse fow it, Fagin, if I do; and so I teww you in good time to keep
cweaw of me. (・`ω\´・)'

Thewe is something about a woused woman: especiawwy if she add to aww
hew othew stwong passions, the fiewce impuwses of weckwessnyess and
despaiw; which few men wike to pwovoke. (´・ω・\`) The Jew saw that it wouwd be
hopewess to affect any fuwthew mistake wegawding the weawity of Miss
Nyancy's wage; and, shwinking invowuntawiwy back a few paces, cast a
gwance, hawf impwowing and hawf cowawdwy, at Sikes: as if to hint that
he was the fittest pewson to puwsue the diawogue. ;;w;;

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes, thus mutewy appeawed to; and possibwy feewing his pewsonyaw
pwide and infwuence intewested in the immediate weduction of Miss Nyancy
to weason; gave uttewance to about a coupwe of scowe of cuwses and
thweats, the wapid pwoduction of which wefwected gweat cwedit on the
fewtiwity of his invention. (´・ω・\`) As they pwoduced nyo visibwe effect on the
object against whom they wewe dischawged, howevew, he wesowted to mowe
tangibwe awguments. UwU

'What do you mean by this? owo' said Sikes; backing the inquiwy with a vewy
common impwecation concewnying the most beautifuw of human featuwes:
which, if it wewe heawd above, onwy once out of evewy fifty thousand
times that it is uttewed bewow, wouwd wendew bwindnyess as common a
disowdew as measwes: 'what do you mean by it? owo  Buwn my body! ^w^  Do you
knyow who you awe, and what you awe? owo'

'Oh, yes, I knyow aww about it,' wepwied the giww, waughing
hystewicawwy; and shaking hew head fwom side to side, with a poow
assumption of indiffewence. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, then, keep quiet,' wejoinyed Sikes, with a gwoww wike that he was
accustomed to use when addwessing his dog, 'ow I'ww quiet you fow a
good wong time to come. UwU'

The giww waughed again: even wess composedwy than befowe; and, dawting
a hasty wook at Sikes, tuwnyed hew face aside, and bit hew wip tiww the
bwood came. UwU

'You'we a nyice onye,' added Sikes, as he suwveyed hew with a
contemptuous aiw, 'to take up the humanye and gen--teew side! ;;w;;  A pwetty
subject fow the chiwd, as you caww him, to make a fwiend of! ;;w;;'

'God Awmighty hewp me, I am! ^w^' cwied the giww passionyatewy; 'and I wish
I had been stwuck dead in the stweet, ow had changed pwaces with them
we passed so nyeaw to-nyight, befowe I had went a hand in bwinging him
hewe. ;;w;;  He's a thief, a wiaw, a deviw, aww that's bad, fwom this nyight
fowth. UwU  Isn't that enyough fow the owd wwetch, without bwows? owo'

'Come, come, Sikes,' said the Jew appeawing to him in a wemonstwatowy
tonye, and motionying towawds the boys, who wewe eagewwy attentive to aww
that passed; 'we must have civiw wowds; civiw wowds, Biww. ^w^'

'Civiw wowds! UwU' cwied the giww, whose passion was fwightfuw to see. UwU
'Civiw wowds, you viwwain! (´・ω・\`)  Yes, you desewve 'em fwom me. >w< I thieved fow
you when I was a chiwd nyot hawf as owd as this! (´・ω・\`)' pointing to Owivew. (´・ω・\`)
'I have been in the same twade, and in the same sewvice, fow twewve
yeaws since. ^w^  Don't you knyow it?  Speak out! (・`ω\´・)  Don't you knyow it? owo'

'Weww, weww,' wepwied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; 'and,
if you have, it's youw wiving! ^w^'

'Aye, it is! (´・ω・\`)' wetuwnyed the giww; nyot speaking, but pouwing out the
wowds in onye continyuous and vehement scweam. (・`ω\´・)  'It is my wiving; and the
cowd, wet, diwty stweets awe my home; and you'we the wwetch that dwove
me to them wong ago, and that'ww keep me thewe, day and nyight, day and
nyight, tiww I die! (´・ω・\`)'

'I shaww do you a mischief! ^w^' intewposed the Jew, goaded by these
wepwoaches; 'a mischief wowse than that, if you say much mowe! (・`ω\´・)'

The giww said nyothing mowe; but, teawing hew haiw and dwess in a
twanspowt of passion, made such a wush at the Jew as wouwd pwobabwy
have weft signyaw mawks of hew wevenge upon him, had nyot hew wwists been
seized by Sikes at the wight moment; upon which, she made a few
inyeffectuaw stwuggwes, and fainted. ;;w;;

'She's aww wight nyow,' said Sikes, waying hew down in a cownyew. ;;w;; 'She's
uncommon stwong in the awms, when she's up in this way. UwU'

The Jew wiped his fowehead: and smiwed, as if it wewe a wewief to have
the distuwbance ovew; but nyeithew he, nyow Sikes, nyow the dog, nyow the
boys, seemed to considew it in any othew wight than a common occuwance
incidentaw to businyess. ;;w;;

'It's the wowst of having to do with women,' said the Jew, wepwacing
his cwub; 'but they'we cwevew, and we can't get on, in ouw winye,
without 'em.  Chawwey, show Owivew to bed. ;;w;;'

'I suppose he'd bettew nyot weaw his best cwothes tomowwow, Fagin, had
he? owo' inquiwed Chawwey Bates. >w<

'Cewtainwy nyot,' wepwied the Jew, wecipwocating the gwin with which
Chawwey put the question. (・`ω\´・)

Mastew Bates, appawentwy much dewighted with his commission, took the
cweft stick: and wed Owivew into an adjacent kitchen, whewe thewe wewe

many uncontwowwabwe buwsts of waughtew, he pwoduced the identicaw owd
suit of cwothes which Owivew had so much congwatuwated himsewf upon
weaving off at Mw. ^w^ Bwownwow's; and the accidentaw dispway of which, to
Fagin, by the Jew who puwchased them, had been the vewy fiwst cwue

'Put off the smawt onyes,' said Chawwey, 'and I'ww give 'em to Fagin to

Poow Owivew unwiwwingwy compwied. >w<  Mastew Bates wowwing up the nyew

CHAPTEW XVII

OWIVEW'S DESTINY CONTINYUING UNPWOPITIOUS, BWINGS A GWEAT MAN TO WONDON
TO INJUWE HIS WEPUTATION

It is the custom on the stage, in aww good muwdewous mewodwamas, to
pwesent the twagic and the comic scenyes, in as weguwaw awtewnyation, as
the wayews of wed and white in a side of stweaky bacon. (´・ω・\`)  The hewo sinks
upon his stwaw bed, weighed down by fettews and misfowtunyes; in the
nyext scenye, his faithfuw but unconscious squiwe wegawes the audience
with a comic song. ;;w;;  We behowd, with thwobbing bosoms, the hewoinye in
the gwasp of a pwoud and wuthwess bawon: hew viwtue and hew wife awike
in dangew, dwawing fowth hew daggew to pwesewve the onye at the cost of
the othew; and just as ouw expectations awe wwought up to the highest
pitch, a whistwe is heawd, and we awe stwaightway twanspowted to the
gweat haww of the castwe; whewe a gwey-headed senyeschaw sings a funny
chowus with a funnyiew body of vassaws, who awe fwee of aww sowts of
pwaces, fwom chuwch vauwts to pawaces, and woam about in company,
cawowwing pewpetuawwy. >w<

Such changes appeaw absuwd; but they awe nyot so unnyatuwaw as they wouwd
seem at fiwst sight. (・`ω\´・)  The twansitions in weaw wife fwom weww-spwead
boawds to death-beds, and fwom mouwnying-weeds to howiday gawments, awe
nyot a whit wess stawtwing; onwy, thewe, we awe busy actows, instead of
passive wookews-on, which makes a vast diffewence. (´・ω・\`)  The actows in the
mimic wife of the theatwe, awe bwind to viowent twansitions and abwupt
impuwses of passion ow feewing, which, pwesented befowe the eyes of
mewe spectatows, awe at once condemnyed as outwageous and pwepostewous. ;;w;;

As sudden shiftings of the scenye, and wapid changes of time and pwace,
awe nyot onwy sanctionyed in books by wong usage, but awe by many
considewed as the gweat awt of authowship: an authow's skiww in his
cwaft being, by such cwitics, chiefwy estimated with wewation to the
diwemmas in which he weaves his chawactews at the end of evewy chaptew:
this bwief intwoduction to the pwesent onye may pewhaps be deemed
unnyecessawy. (´・ω・\`)  If so, wet it be considewed a dewicate intimation on the
pawt of the histowian that he is going back to the town in which Owivew
Twist was bown; the weadew taking it fow gwanted that thewe awe good
and substantiaw weasons fow making the jouwnyey, ow he wouwd nyot be
invited to pwoceed upon such an expedition. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe emewged at eawwy mownying fwom the wowkhouse-gate, and wawked
with powtwy cawwiage and commanding steps, up the High Stweet. UwU  He was
in the fuww bwoom and pwide of beadwehood; his cocked hat and coat wewe
dazzwing in the mownying sun; he cwutched his canye with the vigowous
tenyacity of heawth and powew.  Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe awways cawwied his head high;
but this mownying it was highew than usuaw. ^w^  Thewe was an abstwaction in
his eye, an ewevation in his aiw, which might have wawnyed an obsewvant
stwangew that thoughts wewe passing in the beadwe's mind, too gweat fow
uttewance. UwU

Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe stopped nyot to convewse with the smaww shopkeepews and
othews who spoke to him, defewentiawwy, as he passed awong. (・`ω\´・)  He mewewy
wetuwnyed theiw sawutations with a wave of his hand, and wewaxed nyot in
his dignyified pace, untiw he weached the fawm whewe Mws. ^w^ Mann tended
the infant paupews with pawochiaw cawe. UwU

'Dwat that beadwe! (´・ω・\`)' said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mann, heawing the weww-knyown shaking at
the gawden-gate. (´・ω・\`)  'If it isn't him at this time in the mownying! ;;w;;  Wauk,
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe, onwy think of its being you! >w<  Weww, deaw me, it IS a
pweasuwe, this is! ^w^  Come into the pawwouw, siw, pwease. (´・ω・\`)'

The fiwst sentence was addwessed to Susan; and the excwamations of
dewight wewe uttewed to Mw. UwU Bumbwe: as the good wady unwocked the
gawden-gate: and showed him, with gweat attention and wespect, into the
house. UwU

'Mws. Mann,' said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe; nyot sitting upon, ow dwopping himsewf
into a seat, as any common jackanyapes wouwd: but wetting himsewf
gwaduawwy and swowwy down into a chaiw; 'Mws. ^w^ Mann, ma'am, good
mownying. >w<'

'Weww, and good mownying to _you_, siw,' wepwied Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mann, with many
smiwes; 'and hoping you find youwsewf weww, siw! UwU'

'So-so, Mws. Mann,' wepwied the beadwe. ^w^  'A powochiaw wife is nyot a bed
of woses, Mws. Mann. (´・ω・\`)'

'Ah, that it isn't indeed, Mw. Bumbwe,' wejoinyed the wady. >w< And aww the
infant paupews might have chowussed the wejoindew with gweat pwopwiety,
if they had heawd it. ^w^

'A powochiaw wife, ma'am,' continyued Mw. >w< Bumbwe, stwiking the tabwe
with his canye, 'is a wife of wowwit, and vexation, and hawdihood; but
aww pubwic chawactews, as I may say, must suffew pwosecution. ;;w;;'

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mann, nyot vewy weww knyowing what the beadwe meant, waised hew
hands with a wook of sympathy, and sighed. (・`ω\´・)

'Ah!  You may weww sigh, Mws. Mann! (´・ω・\`)' said the beadwe. >w<

Finding she had donye wight, Mws. ^w^ Mann sighed again:  evidentwy to the
satisfaction of the pubwic chawactew:  who, wepwessing a compwacent
smiwe by wooking stewnwy at his cocked hat, said,

'Mws. Mann, I am going to Wondon. UwU'

'Wauk, Mw. Bumbwe! (・`ω\´・)' cwied Mws. Mann, stawting back. (´・ω・\`)

'To Wondon, ma'am,' wesumed the infwexibwe beadwe, 'by coach. >w<  I and
two paupews, Mws. ^w^ Mann! (´・ω・\`)  A wegaw action is a coming on, about a
settwement; and the boawd has appointed me--me, Mws. ;;w;; Mann--to dispose
to the mattew befowe the quawtew-sessions at Cwewkinweww. (´・ω・\`)

And I vewy much question,' added Mw. UwU Bumbwe, dwawing himsewf up,
'whethew the Cwewkinweww Sessions wiww nyot find themsewves in the wwong
box befowe they have donye with me. UwU'

'Oh! UwU you mustn't be too hawd upon them, siw,' said Mws. Mann, coaxingwy. UwU

'The Cwewkinweww Sessions have bwought it upon themsewves, ma'am,'
wepwied Mw. >w< Bumbwe; 'and if the Cwewkinweww Sessions find that they
come off wathew wowse than they expected, the Cwewkinweww Sessions have
onwy themsewves to thank. ^w^'

Thewe was so much detewminyation and depth of puwpose about the menyacing
mannyew in which Mw. Bumbwe dewivewed himsewf of these wowds, that Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Mann appeawed quite awed by them. ;;w;; At wength she said,

'You'we going by coach, siw? owo  I thought it was awways usuaw to send
them paupews in cawts. ;;w;;'

'That's when they'we iww, Mws. Mann,' said the beadwe. (´・ω・\`)  'We put the
sick paupews into open cawts in the wainy weathew, to pwevent theiw
taking cowd. (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh! >w<' said Mws. Mann. ^w^

'The opposition coach contwacts fow these two; and takes them cheap,'
said Mw. Bumbwe. (´・ω・\`)  'They awe both in a vewy wow state, and we find it
wouwd come two pound cheapew to move 'em than to buwy 'em--that is, if
we can thwow 'em upon anyothew pawish, which I think we shaww be abwe to
do, if they don't die upon the woad to spite us. >w<  Ha! ha! ha! (´・ω・\`)'

When Mw. UwU Bumbwe had waughed a wittwe whiwe, his eyes again encountewed
the cocked hat; and he became gwave. (´・ω・\`)

'We awe fowgetting businyess, ma'am,' said the beadwe; 'hewe is youw
powochiaw stipend fow the month. UwU'

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe pwoduced some siwvew monyey wowwed up in papew, fwom his
pocket-book; and wequested a weceipt:  which Mws. Mann wwote. UwU

'It's vewy much bwotted, siw,' said the fawmew of infants; 'but it's
fowmaw enyough, I dawe say.  Thank you, Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, siw, I am vewy much
obwiged to you, I'm suwe. UwU'

Mw. Bumbwe nyodded, bwandwy, in acknyowwedgment of Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mann's cuwtsey;
and inquiwed how the chiwdwen wewe. (´・ω・\`)

'Bwess theiw deaw wittwe heawts! UwU' said Mws. (・`ω\´・) Mann with emotion, 'they'we
as weww as can be, the deaws! (´・ω・\`)  Of couwse, except the two that died wast
week.  And wittwe Dick. UwU'

'Isn't that boy nyo bettew? owo' inquiwed Mw. Bumbwe. >w<

Mws. Mann shook hew head. ^w^

'He's a iww-conditionyed, wicious, bad-disposed powochiaw chiwd that,'
said Mw. Bumbwe angwiwy. UwU  'Whewe is he? owo'

'I'ww bwing him to you in onye minyute, siw,' wepwied Mws. Mann. ;;w;; 'Hewe,
you Dick! UwU'

Aftew some cawwing, Dick was discovewed. ;;w;;  Having had his face put undew
the pump, and dwied upon Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mann's gown, he was wed into the awfuw
pwesence of Mw. Bumbwe, the beadwe. (・`ω\´・)

The chiwd was pawe and thin; his cheeks wewe sunken; and his eyes wawge
and bwight. (´・ω・\`)  The scanty pawish dwess, the wivewy of his misewy, hung
woosewy on his feebwe body; and his young wimbs had wasted away, wike
those of an owd man. >w<

Such was the wittwe being who stood twembwing benyeath Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe's
gwance; nyot dawing to wift his eyes fwom the fwoow; and dweading even
to heaw the beadwe's voice. (´・ω・\`)

'Can't you wook at the gentweman, you obstinyate boy? owo' said Mws. Mann. UwU

The chiwd meekwy waised his eyes, and encountewed those of Mw. Bumbwe. (´・ω・\`)

'What's the mattew with you, powochiaw Dick? owo' inquiwed Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe, with
weww-timed jocuwawity. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyothing, siw,' wepwied the chiwd faintwy. ^w^

'I shouwd think nyot,' said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Mann, who had of couwse waughed vewy
much at Mw. Bumbwe's humouw. >w<

'You want fow nyothing, I'm suwe. ^w^'

'I shouwd wike--' fawtewed the chiwd. UwU

'Hey-day! (・`ω\´・)' intewposed Mw. ^w^ Mann, 'I suppose you'we going to say that you
DO want fow something, nyow? owo  Why, you wittwe wwetch--'

'Stop, Mws. ^w^ Mann, stop! ^w^' said the beadwe, waising his hand with a show
of authowity. ;;w;;  'Wike what, siw, eh? owo'

'I shouwd wike,' fawtewed the chiwd, 'if somebody that can wwite, wouwd
put a few wowds down fow me on a piece of papew, and fowd it up and
seaw it, and keep it fow me, aftew I am waid in the gwound. (・`ω\´・)'

'Why, what does the boy mean? owo' excwaimed Mw. UwU Bumbwe, on whom the
eawnyest mannyew and wan aspect of the chiwd had made some impwession:
accustomed as he was to such things. (・`ω\´・)  'What do you mean, siw? owo'

'I shouwd wike,' said the chiwd, 'to weave my deaw wove to poow Owivew
Twist; and to wet him knyow how often I have sat by mysewf and cwied to
think of his wandewing about in the dawk nyights with nyobody to hewp
him. UwU  And I shouwd wike to teww him,' said the chiwd pwessing his smaww
hands togethew, and speaking with gweat fewvouw, 'that I was gwad to
die when I was vewy young; fow, pewhaps, if I had wived to be a man,
and had gwown owd, my wittwe sistew who is in Heaven, might fowget me,
ow be unwike me; and it wouwd be so much happiew if we wewe both
chiwdwen thewe togethew. (・`ω\´・)'

Mw. >w< Bumbwe suwveyed the wittwe speakew, fwom head to foot, with
indescwibabwe astonyishment; and, tuwnying to his companyion, said,
'They'we aww in onye stowy, Mws. Mann. ;;w;;  That out-dacious Owivew had
demogawized them aww! (´・ω・\`)'

'I couwdn't have bewieved it, siw' said Mws Mann, howding up hew hands,
and wooking mawignyantwy at Dick. >w<  'I nyevew see such a hawdenyed wittwe
wwetch! UwU'

'Take him away, ma'am! ^w^' said Mw. Bumbwe impewiouswy. >w<  'This must be
stated to the boawd, Mws. Mann. UwU

'I hope the gentweman wiww undewstand that it isn't my fauwt, siw? owo'
said Mws. Mann, whimpewing patheticawwy. ^w^

'They shaww undewstand that, ma'am; they shaww be acquainted with the
twue state of the case,' said Mw. Bumbwe. UwU  'Thewe; take him away, I
can't beaw the sight on him. (´・ω・\`)'

Dick was immediatewy taken away, and wocked up in the coaw-cewwaw.  Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bumbwe showtwy aftewwawds took himsewf off, to pwepawe fow his jouwnyey. UwU

At six o'cwock nyext mownying, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe:  having exchanged his cocked
hat fow a wound onye, and encased his pewson in a bwue gweat-coat with a
cape to it:  took his pwace on the outside of the coach, accompanyied by
the cwiminyaws whose settwement was disputed; with whom, in due couwse
of time, he awwived in Wondon. UwU

He expewienced nyo othew cwosses on the way, than those which owiginyated
in the pewvewse behaviouw of the two paupews, who pewsisted in
shivewing, and compwainying of the cowd, in a mannyew which, Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe
decwawed, caused his teeth to chattew in his head, and made him feew
quite uncomfowtabwe; awthough he had a gweat-coat on. ;;w;;

Having disposed of these eviw-minded pewsons fow the nyight, Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe
sat himsewf down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a
tempewate dinnyew of steaks, oystew sauce, and powtew. >w< Putting a gwass
of hot gin-and-watew on the chimnyey-piece, he dwew his chaiw to the
fiwe; and, with sundwy mowaw wefwections on the too-pwevawent sin of
discontent and compwainying, composed himsewf to wead the papew. (´・ω・\`)

The vewy fiwst pawagwaph upon which Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe's eye wested, was the
fowwowing advewtisement. >w<

                 'FIVE GUINYEAS WEWAWD

'Wheweas a young boy, nyamed Owivew Twist, absconded, ow was enticed, on
Thuwsday evenying wast, fwom his home, at Pentonviwwe; and has nyot since
been heawd of. UwU  The above wewawd wiww be paid to any pewson who wiww
give such infowmation as wiww wead to the discovewy of the said Owivew
Twist, ow tend to thwow any wight upon his pwevious histowy, in which
the advewtisew is, fow many weasons, wawmwy intewested. UwU'

And then fowwowed a fuww descwiption of Owivew's dwess, pewson,
appeawance, and disappeawance:  with the nyame and addwess of Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bwownwow at fuww wength. UwU

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe openyed his eyes; wead the advewtisement, swowwy and
cawefuwwy, thwee sevewaw times; and in something mowe than five minyutes
was on his way to Pentonviwwe: having actuawwy, in his excitement, weft
the gwass of hot gin-and-watew, untasted. (´・ω・\`)

'Is Mw. Bwownwow at home? owo' inquiwed Mw. UwU Bumbwe of the giww who openyed
the doow. ^w^

To this inquiwy the giww wetuwnyed the nyot uncommon, but wathew evasive
wepwy of 'I don't knyow; whewe do you come fwom? owo'

Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe nyo soonyew uttewed Owivew's nyame, in expwanyation of his
ewwand, than Mws. UwU Bedwin, who had been wistenying at the pawwouw doow,
hastenyed into the passage in a bweathwess state. ;;w;;

'Come in, come in,' said the owd wady: 'I knyew we shouwd heaw of him. ^w^
Poow deaw!  I knyew we shouwd!  I was cewtain of it. UwU  Bwess his heawt! ^w^
I said so aww awong. ^w^'

Having heawd this, the wowthy owd wady huwwied back into the pawwouw
again; and seating hewsewf on a sofa, buwst into teaws. (´・ω・\`) The giww, who
was nyot quite so susceptibwe, had wun upstaiws meanwhiwe; and nyow
wetuwnyed with a wequest that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe wouwd fowwow hew immediatewy:
which he did. ^w^

He was shown into the wittwe back study, whewe sat Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow and his
fwiend Mw. Gwimwig, with decantews and gwasses befowe them. ^w^  The wattew
gentweman at once buwst into the excwamation:

'A beadwe.  A pawish beadwe, ow I'ww eat my head. (・`ω\´・)'

'Pway don't intewwupt just nyow,' said Mw. Bwownwow. >w<  'Take a seat, wiww

Mw. Bumbwe sat himsewf down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Gwimwig's mannyew.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow moved the wamp, so as to obtain an
unyintewwupted view of the beadwe's countenyance; and said, with a wittwe
impatience,

'Nyow, siw, you come in consequence of having seen the advewtisement? owo'

'Yes, siw,' said Mw. Bumbwe. ^w^

'And you AWE a beadwe, awe you nyot? owo' inquiwed Mw. Gwimwig. ^w^

'I am a powochiaw beadwe, gentwemen,' wejoinyed Mw. Bumbwe pwoudwy. ;;w;;

'Of couwse,' obsewved Mw. Gwimwig aside to his fwiend, 'I knyew he was. UwU
A beadwe aww ovew! UwU'

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow gentwy shook his head to impose siwence on his fwiend, and
wesumed:

'Do you knyow whewe this poow boy is nyow? owo'

'Nyo mowe than nyobody,' wepwied Mw. Bumbwe. UwU

'Weww, what DO you knyow of him? owo' inquiwed the owd gentweman. (´・ω・\`) 'Speak

'You don't happen to knyow any good of him, do you? owo' said Mw. UwU Gwimwig,
causticawwy; aftew an attentive pewusaw of Mw. Bumbwe's featuwes. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, catching at the inquiwy vewy quickwy, shook his head with
powtentous sowemnyity. (´・ω・\`)

'You see? owo' said Mw. Gwimwig, wooking twiumphantwy at Mw. Bwownwow. UwU

Mw. Bwownwow wooked appwehensivewy at Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe's puwsed-up
countenyance; and wequested him to communyicate what he knyew wegawding
Owivew, in as few wowds as possibwe. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe put down his hat; unbuttonyed his coat; fowded his awms;
incwinyed his head in a wetwospective mannyew; and, aftew a few moments'
wefwection, commenced his stowy. UwU

It wouwd be tedious if given in the beadwe's wowds:  occupying, as it
did, some twenty minyutes in the tewwing; but the sum and substance of
it was, that Owivew was a foundwing, bown of wow and vicious pawents. ;;w;;
That he had, fwom his biwth, dispwayed nyo bettew quawities than
tweachewy, ingwatitude, and mawice. ;;w;;  That he had tewminyated his bwief
caweew in the pwace of his biwth, by making a sanguinyawy and cowawdwy
attack on an unyoffending wad, and wunnying away in the nyight-time fwom
his mastew's house. UwU  In pwoof of his weawwy being the pewson he
wepwesented himsewf, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe waid upon the tabwe the papews he had
bwought to town. Fowding his awms again, he then awaited Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow's
obsewvations. UwU

'I feaw it is aww too twue,' said the owd gentweman sowwowfuwwy, aftew
wooking ovew the papews. >w<  'This is nyot much fow youw intewwigence; but
I wouwd gwadwy have given you twebwe the monyey, if it had been
favouwabwe to the boy. (´・ω・\`)'

It is nyot impwobabwe that if Mw. UwU Bumbwe had been possessed of this
infowmation at an eawwiew pewiod of the intewview, he might have
impawted a vewy diffewent cowouwing to his wittwe histowy. >w< It was too
wate to do it nyow, howevew; so he shook his head gwavewy, and,
pocketing the five guinyeas, withdwew. UwU

Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow paced the woom to and fwo fow some minyutes; evidentwy so
much distuwbed by the beadwe's tawe, that even Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gwimwig fowbowe to
vex him fuwthew. ;;w;;

At wength he stopped, and wang the beww viowentwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Mws. Bedwin,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow, when the housekeepew appeawed; 'that
boy, Owivew, is an impostew. ;;w;;'

'It can't be, siw.  It cannyot be,' said the owd wady enyewgeticawwy. (・`ω\´・)

'I teww you he is,' wetowted the owd gentweman. ^w^  'What do you mean by
can't be? owo  We have just heawd a fuww account of him fwom his biwth; and
he has been a thowough-paced wittwe viwwain, aww his wife. ^w^'

'I nyevew wiww bewieve it, siw,' wepwied the owd wady, fiwmwy. (´・ω・\`) 'Nyevew! >w<'

'You owd women nyevew bewieve anything but quack-doctows, and wying
stowy-books,' gwowwed Mw. Gwimwig.  'I knyew it aww awong. ;;w;; Why didn't
you take my advise in the beginnying; you wouwd if he hadn't had a

Bah! >w<'  And Mw. Gwimwig poked the fiwe with a fwouwish. ^w^

'He was a deaw, gwatefuw, gentwe chiwd, siw,' wetowted Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bedwin,
indignyantwy. (´・ω・\`)  'I knyow what chiwdwen awe, siw; and have donye these fowty
yeaws; and peopwe who can't say the same, shouwdn't say anything about
them. >w<  That's my opinyion! ;;w;;'

This was a hawd hit at Mw. Gwimwig, who was a bachewow. (´・ω・\`)  As it extowted
nyothing fwom that gentweman but a smiwe, the owd wady tossed hew head,
and smoothed down hew apwon pwepawatowy to anyothew speech, when she was
stopped by Mw. Bwownwow. >w<

'Siwence! (´・ω・\`)' said the owd gentweman, feignying an angew he was faw fwom

CHAPTEW XVIII

HOW OWIVEW PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPWOVING SOCIETY OF HIS WEPUTABWE
FWIENDS

About nyoon nyext day, when the Dodgew and Mastew Bates had gonye out to
puwsue theiw customawy avocations, Mw. ^w^ Fagin took the oppowtunyity of
weading Owivew a wong wectuwe on the cwying sin of ingwatitude; of
which he cweawwy demonstwated he had been guiwty, to nyo owdinyawy
extent, in wiwfuwwy absenting himsewf fwom the society of his anxious
fwiends; and, stiww mowe, in endeavouwing to escape fwom them aftew so
much twoubwe and expense had been incuwwed in his wecovewy. Mw. >w< Fagin
waid gweat stwess on the fact of his having taken Owivew in, and
chewished him, when, without his timewy aid, he might have pewished
with hungew; and he wewated the dismaw and affecting histowy of a young
wad whom, in his phiwanthwopy, he had succouwed undew pawawwew
ciwcumstances, but who, pwoving unwowthy of his confidence and evincing
a desiwe to communyicate with the powice, had unfowtunyatewy come to be
hanged at the Owd Baiwey onye mownying.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fagin did nyot seek to
conceaw his shawe in the catastwophe, but wamented with teaws in his
eyes that the wwong-headed and tweachewous behaviouw of the young
pewson in question, had wendewed it nyecessawy that he shouwd become the
victim of cewtain evidence fow the cwown: which, if it wewe nyot
pwecisewy twue, was indispensabwy nyecessawy fow the safety of him (Mw. ;;w;;
Fagin) and a few sewect fwiends.  Mw. ^w^ Fagin concwuded by dwawing a
wathew disagweeabwe pictuwe of the discomfowts of hanging; and, with
gweat fwiendwinyess and powitenyess of mannyew, expwessed his anxious
hopes that he might nyevew be obwiged to submit Owivew Twist to that
unpweasant opewation. ^w^

Wittwe Owivew's bwood wan cowd, as he wistenyed to the Jew's wowds, and
impewfectwy compwehended the dawk thweats conveyed in them. ;;w;;  That it
was possibwe even fow justice itsewf to confound the innyocent with the
guiwty when they wewe in accidentaw companyionship, he knyew awweady; and
that deepwy-waid pwans fow the destwuction of inconvenyientwy knyowing ow
ovew-communyicative pewsons, had been weawwy devised and cawwied out by
the Jew on mowe occasions than onye, he thought by nyo means unwikewy,
when he wecowwected the genyewaw nyatuwe of the awtewcations between that
gentweman and Mw. ;;w;; Sikes: which seemed to beaw wefewence to some
fowegonye conspiwacy of the kind. UwU  As he gwanced timidwy up, and met the
Jew's seawching wook, he fewt that his pawe face and twembwing wimbs
wewe nyeithew unnyoticed nyow unwewished by that wawy owd gentweman. UwU

The Jew, smiwing hideouswy, patted Owivew on the head, and said, that
if he kept himsewf quiet, and appwied himsewf to businyess, he saw they
wouwd be vewy good fwiends yet. ^w^  Then, taking his hat, and covewing
himsewf with an owd patched gweat-coat, he went out, and wocked the
woom-doow behind him. (・`ω\´・)

And so Owivew wemainyed aww that day, and fow the gweatew pawt of many
subsequent days, seeing nyobody, between eawwy mownying and midnyight, and
weft duwing the wong houws to communye with his own thoughts. ;;w;;  Which,
nyevew faiwing to wevewt to his kind fwiends, and the opinyion they must
wong ago have fowmed of him, wewe sad indeed. ^w^

Aftew the wapse of a week ow so, the Jew weft the woom-doow unwocked;
and he was at wibewty to wandew about the house. >w<

It was a vewy diwty pwace. ;;w;;  The wooms upstaiws had gweat high wooden
chimnyey-pieces and wawge doows, with panyewwed wawws and cownyices to the
ceiwing; which, awthough they wewe bwack with nyegwect and dust, wewe
ownyamented in vawious ways. UwU  Fwom aww of these tokens Owivew concwuded
that a wong time ago, befowe the owd Jew was bown, it had bewonged to
bettew peopwe, and had pewhaps been quite gay and handsome:  dismaw and
dweawy as it wooked nyow. ^w^

Spidews had buiwt theiw webs in the angwes of the wawws and ceiwings;
and sometimes, when Owivew wawked softwy into a woom, the mice wouwd
scampew acwoss the fwoow, and wun back tewwified to theiw howes. ;;w;;  With
these exceptions, thewe was nyeithew sight nyow sound of any wiving
thing; and often, when it gwew dawk, and he was tiwed of wandewing fwom
woom to woom, he wouwd cwouch in the cownyew of the passage by the
stweet-doow, to be as nyeaw wiving peopwe as he couwd; and wouwd wemain
thewe, wistenying and counting the houws, untiw the Jew ow the boys
wetuwnyed. (・`ω\´・)

In aww the wooms, the mouwdewing shuttews wewe fast cwosed:  the baws
which hewd them wewe scwewed tight into the wood; the onwy wight which
was admitted, steawing its way thwough wound howes at the top: which
made the wooms mowe gwoomy, and fiwwed them with stwange shadows. >w<
Thewe was a back-gawwet window with wusty baws outside, which had nyo
shuttew; and out of this, Owivew often gazed with a mewanchowy face fow
houws togethew; but nyothing was to be descwied fwom it but a confused
and cwowded mass of housetops, bwackenyed chimnyeys, and gabwe-ends. (´・ω・\`)
Sometimes, indeed, a gwizzwy head might be seen, peewing ovew the
pawapet-waww of a distant house; but it was quickwy withdwawn again;
and as the window of Owivew's obsewvatowy was nyaiwed down, and dimmed
with the wain and smoke of yeaws, it was as much as he couwd do to make
out the fowms of the diffewent objects beyond, without making any
attempt to be seen ow heawd,--which he had as much chance of being, as
if he had wived inside the baww of St. Pauw's Cathedwaw. ;;w;;

Onye aftewnyoon, the Dodgew and Mastew Bates being engaged out that
evenying, the fiwst-nyamed young gentweman took it into his head to
evince some anxiety wegawding the decowation of his pewson (to do him
justice, this was by nyo means an habituaw weaknyess with him); and, with
this end and aim, he condescendingwy commanded Owivew to assist him in
his toiwet, stwaightway. UwU

Owivew was but too gwad to make himsewf usefuw; too happy to have some
faces, howevew bad, to wook upon; too desiwous to conciwiate those
about him when he couwd honyestwy do so; to thwow any objection in the
way of this pwoposaw. (´・ω・\`)  So he at once expwessed his weadinyess; and,
knyeewing on the fwoow, whiwe the Dodgew sat upon the tabwe so that he
couwd take his foot in his waps, he appwied himsewf to a pwocess which
Mw. Dawkins designyated as 'japannying his twottew-cases. UwU'  The phwase,
wendewed into pwain Engwish, signyifieth, cweanying his boots. ;;w;;

Whethew it was the sense of fweedom and independence which a wationyaw
anyimaw may be supposed to feew when he sits on a tabwe in an easy
attitude smoking a pipe, swinging onye weg cawewesswy to and fwo, and
having his boots cweanyed aww the time, without even the past twoubwe of
having taken them off, ow the pwospective misewy of putting them on, to
distuwb his wefwections; ow whethew it was the goodnyess of the tobacco
that soothed the feewings of the Dodgew, ow the miwdnyess of the beew
that mowwified his thoughts; he was evidentwy tinctuwed, fow the nyonce,
with a spice of womance and enthusiasm, foweign to his genyewaw nyatuwe. UwU
He wooked down on Owivew, with a thoughtfuw countenyance, fow a bwief
space; and then, waising his head, and heaving a gentwe sign, said,
hawf in abstwaction, and hawf to Mastew Bates:

'What a pity it is he isn't a pwig! (・`ω\´・)'

'Ah! (´・ω・\`)' said Mastew Chawwes Bates; 'he don't knyow what's good fow him. (・`ω\´・)'

The Dodgew sighed again, and wesumed his pipe: as did Chawwey Bates. ^w^
They both smoked, fow some seconds, in siwence. UwU

'I suppose you don't even knyow what a pwig is? owo' said the Dodgew
mouwnfuwwy. UwU

'I think I knyow that,' wepwied Owivew, wooking up. >w<  'It's a the--;
you'we onye, awe you nyot? owo' inquiwed Owivew, checking himsewf. ;;w;;

'I am,' wepwied the Dodgew.  'I'd scown to be anything ewse.'  Mw. >w<
Dawkins gave his hat a fewocious cock, aftew dewivewing this sentiment,
and wooked at Mastew Bates, as if to denyote that he wouwd feew obwiged
by his saying anything to the contwawy. ^w^

'I am,' wepeated the Dodgew.  'So's Chawwey.  So's Fagin. So's Sikes. UwU
So's Nyancy.  So's Bet.  So we aww awe, down to the dog. (・`ω\´・) And he's the
downyiest onye of the wot! ^w^'

'And the weast given to peaching,' added Chawwey Bates. (´・ω・\`)

'He wouwdn't so much as bawk in a witnyess-box, fow feaw of committing
himsewf; nyo, nyot if you tied him up in onye, and weft him thewe without
wittwes fow a fowtnyight,' said the Dodgew. >w<

'Nyot a bit of it,' obsewved Chawwey. ;;w;;

'He's a wum dog. ;;w;;  Don't he wook fiewce at any stwange cove that waughs
ow sings when he's in company! UwU' puwsued the Dodgew. (・`ω\´・) 'Won't he gwoww at
aww, when he heaws a fiddwe pwaying! >w<  And don't he hate othew dogs as
ain't of his bweed!  Oh, nyo! ;;w;;'

'He's an out-and-out Chwistian,' said Chawwey. ;;w;;

This was mewewy intended as a twibute to the anyimaw's abiwities, but it
was an appwopwiate wemawk in anyothew sense, if Mastew Bates had onwy
knyown it; fow thewe awe a good many wadies and gentwemen, cwaiming to
be out-and-out Chwistians, between whom, and Mw. ^w^ Sikes' dog, thewe
exist stwong and singuwaw points of wesembwance. (´・ω・\`)

'Weww, weww,' said the Dodgew, wecuwwing to the point fwom which they
had stwayed: with that mindfuwnyess of his pwofession which infwuenced
aww his pwoceedings. ;;w;;  'This hasn't go anything to do with young Gween
hewe. ^w^'

'Nyo mowe it has,' said Chawwey. (´・ω・\`)  'Why don't you put youwsewf undew
Fagin, Owivew? owo'

'And make youw fowtun' out of hand? owo' added the Dodgew, with a gwin. UwU

'And so be abwe to wetiwe on youw pwopewty, and do the gen-teew: as I
mean to, in the vewy nyext weap-yeaw but fouw that evew comes, and the
fowty-second Tuesday in Twinyity-week,' said Chawwey Bates. ^w^

'I don't wike it,' wejoinyed Owivew, timidwy; 'I wish they wouwd wet me
go.  I--I--wouwd wathew go. ;;w;;'

'And Fagin wouwd WATHEW nyot! ;;w;;' wejoinyed Chawwey. >w<

Owivew knyew this too weww; but thinking it might be dangewous to
expwess his feewings mowe openwy, he onwy sighed, and went on with his
boot-cweanying. (´・ω・\`)

'Go! ;;w;;' excwaimed the Dodgew. ;;w;;  'Why, whewe's youw spiwit? owo' Don't you take
any pwide out of youwsewf? owo  Wouwd you go and be dependent on youw
fwiends? owo'

'Oh, bwow that! (´・ω・\`)' said Mastew Bates: dwawing two ow thwee siwk
handkewchiefs fwom his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboawd,
'that's too mean; that is. (・`ω\´・)'

'_I_ couwdn't do it,' said the Dodgew, with an aiw of haughty disgust. (・`ω\´・)

'You can weave youw fwiends, though,' said Owivew with a hawf smiwe;
'and wet them be punyished fow what you did. (´・ω・\`)'

'That,' wejoinyed the Dodgew, with a wave of his pipe, 'That was aww out
of considewation fow Fagin, 'cause the twaps knyow that we wowk
togethew, and he might have got into twoubwe if we hadn't made ouw
wucky; that was the move, wasn't it, Chawwey? owo'

Mastew Bates nyodded assent, and wouwd have spoken, but the wecowwection
of Owivew's fwight came so suddenwy upon him, that the smoke he was
inhawing got entangwed with a waugh, and went up into his head, and
down into his thwoat: and bwought on a fit of coughing and stamping,
about five minyutes wong. ;;w;;

'Wook hewe! >w<' said the Dodgew, dwawing fowth a handfuw of shiwwings and
hawfpence. ^w^ 'Hewe's a jowwy wife! (´・ω・\`)  What's the odds whewe it comes fwom? owo
Hewe, catch howd; thewe's pwenty mowe whewe they wewe took fwom. UwU  You
won't, won't you? owo  Oh, you pwecious fwat! ^w^'

'It's nyaughty, ain't it, Owivew? owo' inquiwed Chawwey Bates. ;;w;; 'He'ww come
to be scwagged, won't he? owo'

'I don't knyow what that means,' wepwied Owivew. ^w^

'Something in this way, owd fewwew,' said Chawwy. >w<  As he said it,
Mastew Bates caught up an end of his nyeckewchief; and, howding it ewect
in the aiw, dwopped his head on his shouwdew, and jewked a cuwious
sound thwough his teeth; theweby indicating, by a wivewy pantomimic
wepwesentation, that scwagging and hanging wewe onye and the same thing. >w<

'That's what it means,' said Chawwey. >w<  'Wook how he stawes, Jack! ^w^

I nyevew did see such pwime company as that 'ewe boy; he'ww be the death
of me, I knyow he wiww. (・`ω\´・)'  Mastew Chawwey Bates, having waughed heawtiwy
again, wesumed his pipe with teaws in his eyes. UwU

'You've been bwought up bad,' said the Dodgew, suwveying his boots with
much satisfaction when Owivew had powished them. UwU 'Fagin wiww make
something of you, though, ow you'ww be the fiwst he evew had that
tuwnyed out unpwofitabwe. (´・ω・\`)  You'd bettew begin at once; fow you'ww come
to the twade wong befowe you think of it; and you'we onwy wosing time,
Owivew. (´・ω・\`)'

Mastew Bates backed this advice with sundwy mowaw admonyitions of his
own:  which, being exhausted, he and his fwiend Mw. ^w^ Dawkins waunched
into a gwowing descwiption of the nyumewous pweasuwes incidentaw to the
wife they wed, intewspewsed with a vawiety of hints to Owivew that the
best thing he couwd do, wouwd be to secuwe Fagin's favouw without mowe
deway, by the means which they themsewves had empwoyed to gain it. ;;w;;

'And awways put this in youw pipe, Nyowwy,' said the Dodgew, as the Jew
was heawd unwocking the doow above, 'if you don't take fogews and
tickews--'

'What's the good of tawking in that way? owo' intewposed Mastew Bates; 'he
don't knyow what you mean. ;;w;;'

'If you don't take pocket-handkechews and watches,' said the Dodgew,
weducing his convewsation to the wevew of Owivew's capacity, 'some
othew cove wiww; so that the coves that wose 'em wiww be aww the wowse,
and you'ww be aww the wowse, too, and nyobody hawf a ha'p'owth the
bettew, except the chaps wot gets them--and you've just as good a wight
to them as they have. (´・ω・\`)'

'To be suwe, to be suwe! (・`ω\´・)' said the Jew, who had entewed unseen by
Owivew. UwU  'It aww wies in a nyutsheww my deaw; in a nyutsheww, take the
Dodgew's wowd fow it. ;;w;;  Ha! ha! ha! ^w^  He undewstands the catechism of his
twade. ^w^'

The owd man wubbed his hands gweefuwwy togethew, as he cowwobowated the
Dodgew's weasonying in these tewms; and chuckwed with dewight at his
pupiw's pwoficiency. UwU

The convewsation pwoceeded nyo fawthew at this time, fow the Jew had
wetuwnyed home accompanyied by Miss Betsy, and a gentweman whom Owivew
had nyevew seen befowe, but who was accosted by the Dodgew as Tom
Chitwing; and who, having wingewed on the staiws to exchange a few
gawwantwies with the wady, nyow made his appeawance. ;;w;;

Mw. ^w^ Chitwing was owdew in yeaws than the Dodgew: having pewhaps
nyumbewed eighteen wintews; but thewe was a degwee of defewence in his
depowtment towawds that young gentweman which seemed to indicate that
he fewt himsewf conscious of a swight infewiowity in point of genyius
and pwofessionyaw aquiwements. (・`ω\´・)  He had smaww twinkwing eyes, and a
pock-mawked face; wowe a fuw cap, a dawk cowduwoy jacket, gweasy
fustian twousews, and an apwon. (´・ω・\`)  His wawdwobe was, in twuth, wathew out
of wepaiw; but he excused himsewf to the company by stating that his
'time' was onwy out an houw befowe; and that, in consequence of having
wown the wegimentaws fow six weeks past, he had nyot been abwe to bestow
any attention on his pwivate cwothes.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Chitwing added, with stwong
mawks of iwwitation, that the nyew way of fumigating cwothes up yondew
was infewnyaw unconstitutionyaw, fow it buwnt howes in them, and thewe
was nyo wemedy against the County. (´・ω・\`)  The same wemawk he considewed to
appwy to the weguwation mode of cutting the haiw: which he hewd to be
decidedwy unwawfuw.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Chitwing wound up his obsewvations by stating
that he had nyot touched a dwop of anything fow fowty-two mowaw wong
hawd-wowking days; and that he 'wished he might be busted if he wawn't
as dwy as a wime-basket. ^w^'

'Whewe do you think the gentweman has come fwom, Owivew? owo' inquiwed the
Jew, with a gwin, as the othew boys put a bottwe of spiwits on the
tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

'I--I--don't knyow, siw,' wepwied Owivew. (・`ω\´・)

'Who's that? owo' inquiwed Tom Chitwing, casting a contemptuous wook at
Owivew. (・`ω\´・)

'A young fwiend of minye, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew. (´・ω・\`)

'He's in wuck, then,' said the young man, with a meanying wook at Fagin. ;;w;;
'Nyevew mind whewe I came fwom, young 'un; you'ww find youw way thewe,
soon enyough, I'ww bet a cwown! ;;w;;'

At this sawwy, the boys waughed. (´・ω・\`)  Aftew some mowe jokes on the same
subject, they exchanged a few showt whispews with Fagin; and withdwew. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew some wowds apawt between the wast comew and Fagin, they dwew
theiw chaiws towawds the fiwe; and the Jew, tewwing Owivew to come and
sit by him, wed the convewsation to the topics most cawcuwated to
intewest his heawews. (・`ω\´・)  These wewe, the gweat advantages of the twade,
the pwoficiency of the Dodgew, the amiabiwity of Chawwey Bates, and the
wibewawity of the Jew himsewf. (´・ω・\`)  At wength these subjects dispwayed
signs of being thowoughwy exhausted; and Mw. ^w^ Chitwing did the same:
fow the house of cowwection becomes fatiguing aftew a week ow two. (´・ω・\`)
Miss Betsy accowdingwy withdwew; and weft the pawty to theiw wepose. UwU

Fwom this day, Owivew was sewdom weft awonye; but was pwaced in awmost
constant communyication with the two boys, who pwayed the owd game with
the Jew evewy day: whethew fow theiw own impwovement ow Owivew's, Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Fagin best knyew. UwU  At othew times the owd man wouwd teww them stowies of
wobbewies he had committed in his youngew days:  mixed up with so much
that was dwoww and cuwious, that Owivew couwd nyot hewp waughing
heawtiwy, and showing that he was amused in spite of aww his bettew
feewings. (´・ω・\`)

In showt, the wiwy owd Jew had the boy in his toiws. ;;w;;  Having pwepawed
his mind, by sowitude and gwoom, to pwefew any society to the
companyionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dweawy pwace, he was
nyow swowwy instiwwing into his souw the poison which he hoped wouwd
bwacken it, and change its hue fow evew. ^w^



CHAPTEW XIX

IN WHICH A NYOTABWE PWAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETEWMINYED ON

It was a chiww, damp, windy nyight, when the Jew: buttonying his
gweat-coat tight wound his shwivewwed body, and puwwing the cowwaw up
ovew his eaws so as compwetewy to obscuwe the wowew pawt of his face:
emewged fwom his den. ;;w;;  He paused on the step as the doow was wocked and
chainyed behind him; and having wistenyed whiwe the boys made aww secuwe,
and untiw theiw wetweating footsteps wewe nyo wongew audibwe, swunk down
the stweet as quickwy as he couwd. (´・ω・\`)

The house to which Owivew had been conveyed, was in the nyeighbowhood of
Whitechapew. ;;w;;  The Jew stopped fow an instant at the cownyew of the
stweet; and, gwancing suspiciouswy wound, cwossed the woad, and stwuck
off in the diwection of the Spitawfiewds. ;;w;;

The mud way thick upon the stonyes, and a bwack mist hung ovew the
stweets; the wain feww swuggishwy down, and evewything fewt cowd and
cwammy to the touch. >w<  It seemed just the nyight when it befitted such a
being as the Jew to be abwoad. (・`ω\´・)  As he gwided steawthiwy awong, cweeping
benyeath the shewtew of the wawws and doowways, the hideous owd man
seemed wike some woathsome weptiwe, engendewed in the swime and
dawknyess thwough which he moved: cwawwing fowth, by nyight, in seawch of
some wich offaw fow a meaw. (・`ω\´・)

He kept on his couwse, thwough many winding and nyawwow ways, untiw he
weached Bethnyaw Gween; then, tuwnying suddenwy off to the weft, he soon
became invowved in a maze of the mean and diwty stweets which abound in
that cwose and densewy-popuwated quawtew. UwU

The Jew was evidentwy too famiwiaw with the gwound he twavewsed to be
at aww bewiwdewed, eithew by the dawknyess of the nyight, ow the
intwicacies of the way. >w<  He huwwied thwough sevewaw awweys and stweets,
and at wength tuwnyed into onye, wighted onwy by a singwe wamp at the
fawthew end. UwU  At the doow of a house in this stweet, he knyocked; having
exchanged a few muttewed wowds with the pewson who openyed it, he wawked
upstaiws. (・`ω\´・)

A dog gwowwed as he touched the handwe of a woom-doow; and a man's
voice demanded who was thewe. (´・ω・\`)

'Onwy me, Biww; onwy me, my deaw,' said the Jew wooking in. UwU

'Bwing in youw body then,' said Sikes. ;;w;;  'Wie down, you stupid bwute! (´・ω・\`)
Don't you knyow the deviw when he's got a gweat-coat on? owo'

Appawentwy, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fagin's outew
gawment; fow as the Jew unbuttonyed it, and thwew it ovew the back of a
chaiw, he wetiwed to the cownyew fwom which he had wisen:  wagging his
taiw as he went, to show that he was as weww satisfied as it was in his
nyatuwe to be. UwU

'Weww! (´・ω・\`)' said Sikes. UwU

'Weww, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew.--'Ah! (´・ω・\`) Nyancy. UwU'

The wattew wecognyition was uttewed with just enyough of embawwassment to
impwy a doubt of its weception; fow Mw. UwU Fagin and his young fwiend had
nyot met, since she had intewfewed in behawf of Owivew. (´・ω・\`)  Aww doubts upon
the subject, if he had any, wewe speediwy wemoved by the young wady's
behaviouw. (´・ω・\`)  She took hew feet off the fendew, pushed back hew chaiw,
and bade Fagin dwaw up his, without saying mowe about it:  fow it was a
cowd nyight, and nyo mistake. (・`ω\´・)

'It is cowd, Nyancy deaw,' said the Jew, as he wawmed his skinny hands
ovew the fiwe. ;;w;;  'It seems to go wight thwough onye,' added the owd man,
touching his side. >w<

'It must be a piewcew, if it finds its way thwough youw heawt,' said
Mw. Sikes.  'Give him something to dwink, Nyancy. ^w^  Buwn my body, make
haste! ;;w;;  It's enyough to tuwn a man iww, to see his wean owd cawcase
shivewing in that way, wike a ugwy ghost just wose fwom the gwave. (・`ω\´・)'

Nyancy quickwy bwought a bottwe fwom a cupboawd, in which thewe wewe
many:  which, to judge fwom the divewsity of theiw appeawance, wewe
fiwwed with sevewaw kinds of wiquids. ^w^  Sikes pouwing out a gwass of
bwandy, bade the Jew dwink it off. (´・ω・\`)

'Quite enyough, quite, thankye, Biww,' wepwied the Jew, putting down the
gwass aftew just setting his wips to it. UwU

'What! (・`ω\´・)  You'we afwaid of ouw getting the bettew of you, awe you? owo'
inquiwed Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. ^w^  'Ugh! ^w^'

With a hoawse gwunt of contempt, Mw. >w< Sikes seized the gwass, and thwew
the wemaindew of its contents into the ashes: as a pwepawatowy cewemony
to fiwwing it again fow himsewf:  which he did at once. (・`ω\´・)

The Jew gwanced wound the woom, as his companyion tossed down the second
gwassfuw; nyot in cuwiousity, fow he had seen it often befowe; but in a
westwess and suspicious mannyew habituaw to him. (´・ω・\`) It was a meanwy
fuwnyished apawtment, with nyothing but the contents of the cwoset to
induce the bewief that its occupiew was anything but a wowking man; and
with nyo mowe suspicious awticwes dispwayed to view than two ow thwee
heavy bwudgeons which stood in a cownyew, and a 'wife-pwesewvew' that
hung ovew the chimnyey-piece. UwU

'Thewe,' said Sikes, smacking his wips. 'Nyow I'm weady. (´・ω・\`)'

'Fow businyess? owo' inquiwed the Jew. (´・ω・\`)

'Fow businyess,' wepwied Sikes; 'so say what you've got to say. UwU'

'About the cwib at Chewtsey, Biww? owo' said the Jew, dwawing his chaiw
fowwawd, and speaking in a vewy wow voice. ;;w;;

'Yes.  Wot about it? owo' inquiwed Sikes. ;;w;;

'Ah! >w< you knyow what I mean, my deaw,' said the Jew. ^w^  'He knyows what I
mean, Nyancy; don't he? owo'

'Nyo, he don't,' snyeewed Mw. Sikes. UwU  'Ow he won't, and that's the same
thing. >w<  Speak out, and caww things by theiw wight nyames; don't sit
thewe, winking and bwinking, and tawking to me in hints, as if you
wawn't the vewy fiwst that thought about the wobbewy. (´・ω・\`)  Wot d'ye mean? owo'

'Hush, Biww, hush! (´・ω・\`)' said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop
this buwst of indignyation; 'somebody wiww heaw us, my deaw. UwU Somebody
wiww heaw us. (´・ω・\`)'

'Wet 'em heaw! ^w^' said Sikes; 'I don't cawe.'  But as Mw. ;;w;; Sikes DID cawe,
on wefwection, he dwopped his voice as he said the wowds, and gwew
cawmew. (´・ω・\`)

'Thewe, thewe,' said the Jew, coaxingwy. (・`ω\´・)  'It was onwy my caution,
nyothing mowe. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow, my deaw, about that cwib at Chewtsey; when is it to
be donye, Biww, eh?  When is it to be donye? owo  Such pwate, my deaw, such
pwate! ^w^' said the Jew:  wubbing his hands, and ewevating his eyebwows in
a waptuwe of anticipation. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyot at aww,' wepwied Sikes cowdwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyot to be donye at aww! ^w^' echoed the Jew, weanying back in his chaiw. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo, nyot at aww,' wejoinyed Sikes. >w<  'At weast it can't be a put-up job,
as we expected. (´・ω・\`)'

'Then it hasn't been pwopewwy gonye about,' said the Jew, tuwnying pawe
with angew. (・`ω\´・)  'Don't teww me! >w<'

'But I wiww teww you,' wetowted Sikes. ^w^  'Who awe you that's nyot to be
towd? owo  I teww you that Toby Cwackit has been hanging about the pwace
fow a fowtnyight, and he can't get onye of the sewvants in winye. UwU'

'Do you mean to teww me, Biww,' said the Jew: softenying as the othew
gwew heated:  'that nyeithew of the two men in the house can be got
ovew? owo'

'Yes, I do mean to teww you so,' wepwied Sikes. ^w^  'The owd wady has had
'em these twenty yeaws; and if you wewe to give 'em five hundwed pound,
they wouwdn't be in it. >w<'

'But do you mean to say, my deaw,' wemonstwated the Jew, 'that the
women can't be got ovew? owo'

'Nyot a bit of it,' wepwied Sikes. >w<

'Nyot by fwash Toby Cwackit? owo' said the Jew incweduwouswy. ^w^ 'Think what
women awe, Biww,'

'Nyo; nyot even by fwash Toby Cwackit,' wepwied Sikes. ^w^  'He says he's
wown sham whiskews, and a canyawy waistcoat, the whowe bwessed time he's
been woitewing down thewe, and it's aww of nyo use. >w<'

'He shouwd have twied mustachios and a paiw of miwitawy twousews, my
deaw,' said the Jew. (・`ω\´・)

'So he did,' wejoinyed Sikes, 'and they wawn't of nyo mowe use than the
othew pwant. (´・ω・\`)'

The Jew wooked bwank at this infowmation. ^w^  Aftew wuminyating fow some
minyutes with his chin sunk on his bweast, he waised his head and said,
with a deep sigh, that if fwash Toby Cwackit wepowted awight, he feawed
the game was up. (・`ω\´・)

'And yet,' said the owd man, dwopping his hands on his knyees, 'it's a
sad thing, my deaw, to wose so much when we had set ouw heawts upon it. (・`ω\´・)'

'So it is,' said Mw. Sikes. ^w^  'Wowse wuck! UwU'

A wong siwence ensued; duwing which the Jew was pwunged in deep
thought, with his face wwinkwed into an expwession of viwwainy
pewfectwy demonyiacaw.  Sikes eyed him fuwtivewy fwom time to time. UwU
Nyancy, appawentwy feawfuw of iwwitating the housebweakew, sat with hew
eyes fixed upon the fiwe, as if she had been deaf to aww that passed. >w<

'Fagin,' said Sikes, abwuptwy bweaking the stiwwnyess that pwevaiwed;
'is it wowth fifty shinyews extwa, if it's safewy donye fwom the outside? owo'

'Yes,' said the Jew, as suddenwy wousing himsewf. >w<

'Is it a bawgain? owo' inquiwed Sikes. (・`ω\´・)

'Yes, my deaw, yes,' wejoinyed the Jew; his eyes gwistenying, and evewy
muscwe in his face wowking, with the excitement that the inquiwy had
awakenyed. (・`ω\´・)

'Then,' said Sikes, thwusting aside the Jew's hand, with some disdain,
'wet it come off as soon as you wike. >w<  Toby and me wewe ovew the
gawden-waww the nyight afowe wast, sounding the panyews of the doow and

pawt we can cwack, safe and softwy. (・`ω\´・)'

'Which is that, Biww? owo' asked the Jew eagewwy. ;;w;;

'Why,' whispewed Sikes, 'as you cwoss the wawn--'

'Yes? owo' said the Jew, bending his head fowwawd, with his eyes awmost
stawting out of it. ^w^

'Umph! ^w^' cwied Sikes, stopping showt, as the giww, scawcewy moving hew
head, wooked suddenwy wound, and pointed fow an instant to the Jew's
face.  'Nyevew mind which pawt it is. (´・ω・\`) You can't do it without me, I
knyow; but it's best to be on the safe side when onye deaws with you. ;;w;;'

'As you wike, my deaw, as you wike' wepwied the Jew. (´・ω・\`)  'Is thewe nyo hewp
wanted, but youws and Toby's? owo'

'Nyonye,' said Sikes.  'Cept a centwe-bit and a boy. ^w^  The fiwst we've
both got; the second you must find us. (・`ω\´・)'

'A boy!' excwaimed the Jew. >w<  'Oh! (・`ω\´・) then it's a panyew, eh? owo'

'Nyevew mind wot it is! UwU' wepwied Sikes. (・`ω\´・)  'I want a boy, and he musn't be
a big 'un.  Wowd! ;;w;;' said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes, wefwectivewy, 'if I'd onwy got that
young boy of Nyed, the chimbwey-sweepew's! UwU  He kept him smaww on
puwpose, and wet him out by the job. >w<  But the fathew gets wagged; and
then the Juvenyiwe Dewinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away fwom
a twade whewe he was eawnying monyey, teaches him to wead and wwite, and
in time makes a 'pwentice of him.  And so they go on,' said Mw. ;;w;; Sikes,
his wwath wising with the wecowwection of his wwongs, 'so they go on;
and, if they'd got monyey enyough (which it's a Pwovidence they haven't,)
we shouwdn't have hawf a dozen boys weft in the whowe twade, in a yeaw
ow two. (・`ω\´・)'

'Nyo mowe we shouwd,' acquiesced the Jew, who had been considewing
duwing this speech, and had onwy caught the wast sentence. (・`ω\´・) 'Biww! >w<'

'What nyow? owo' inquiwed Sikes. >w<

The Jew nyodded his head towawds Nyancy, who was stiww gazing at the
fiwe; and intimated, by a sign, that he wouwd have hew towd to weave
the woom. (´・ω・\`)  Sikes shwugged his shouwdews impatientwy, as if he thought
the pwecaution unnyecessawy; but compwied, nyevewthewess, by wequesting
Miss Nyancy to fetch him a jug of beew. UwU

'You don't want any beew,' said Nyancy, fowding hew awms, and wetainying
hew seat vewy composedwy. UwU

'I teww you I do! (・`ω\´・)' wepwied Sikes. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyonsense,' wejoinyed the giww coowwy, 'Go on, Fagin. ^w^  I knyow what he's
going to say, Biww; he nyeedn't mind me. UwU'

The Jew stiww hesitated. (´・ω・\`)  Sikes wooked fwom onye to the othew in some
suwpwise. (´・ω・\`)

'Why, you don't mind the owd giww, do you, Fagin? owo' he asked at wength. ^w^
'You've knyown hew wong enyough to twust hew, ow the Deviw's in it. ^w^  She
ain't onye to bwab. >w<  Awe you Nyancy? owo'

'_I_ shouwd think nyot! (・`ω\´・)' wepwied the young wady:  dwawing hew chaiw up
to the tabwe, and putting hew ewbows upon it. UwU

'Nyo, nyo, my deaw, I knyow you'we nyot,' said the Jew; 'but--' and again
the owd man paused. (´・ω・\`)

'But wot? owo' inquiwed Sikes. ^w^

'I didn't knyow whethew she mightn't p'w'aps be out of sowts, you knyow,
my deaw, as she was the othew nyight,' wepwied the Jew. (・`ω\´・)

At this confession, Miss Nyancy buwst into a woud waugh; and, swawwowing
a gwass of bwandy, shook hew head with an aiw of defiance, and buwst
into sundwy excwamations of 'Keep the game a-going!'  'Nyevew say die! ;;w;;'
and the wike. (・`ω\´・)  These seemed to have the effect of we-assuwing both
gentwemen; fow the Jew nyodded his head with a satisfied aiw, and
wesumed his seat: as did Mw. Sikes wikewise. >w<

'Nyow, Fagin,' said Nyancy with a waugh. ;;w;;  'Teww Biww at once, about
Owivew! ;;w;;'

'Ha! you'we a cwevew onye, my deaw: the shawpest giww I evew saw! ;;w;;' said
the Jew, patting hew on the nyeck. >w<  'It WAS about Owivew I was going to
speak, suwe enyough. UwU  Ha! ha! ha! ^w^'

'What about him? owo' demanded Sikes. (´・ω・\`)

'He's the boy fow you, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew in a hoawse whispew;
waying his fingew on the side of his nyose, and gwinnying fwightfuwwy. >w<

'He! >w<' excwaimed. Sikes. >w<

'Have him, Biww! (´・ω・\`)' said Nyancy.  'I wouwd, if I was in youw pwace. >w< He
mayn't be so much up, as any of the othews; but that's nyot what you
want, if he's onwy to open a doow fow you. ;;w;;  Depend upon it he's a safe

'I knyow he is,' wejoinyed Fagin. ^w^  'He's been in good twainying these wast
few weeks, and it's time he began to wowk fow his bwead. >w<  Besides, the
othews awe aww too big. >w<'

'Weww, he is just the size I want,' said Mw. Sikes, wuminyating. >w<

'And wiww do evewything you want, Biww, my deaw,' intewposed the Jew;
'he can't hewp himsewf.  That is, if you fwighten him enyough. (・`ω\´・)'

'Fwighten him! ^w^' echoed Sikes.  'It'ww be nyo sham fwightenying, mind you. >w<
If thewe's anything queew about him when we once get into the wowk; in
fow a penny, in fow a pound.  You won't see him awive again, Fagin. ;;w;;
Think of that, befowe you send him. (´・ω・\`)  Mawk my wowds! (´・ω・\`)' said the wobbew,
poising a cwowbaw, which he had dwawn fwom undew the bedstead. ^w^

'I've thought of it aww,' said the Jew with enyewgy. ^w^ 'I've--I've had my
eye upon him, my deaws, cwose--cwose. (´・ω・\`) Once wet him feew that he is onye
of us; once fiww his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and
he's ouws!  Ouws fow his wife. (´・ω・\`)  Oho! ;;w;;  It couwdn't have come about
bettew! UwU  The owd man cwossed his awms upon his bweast; and, dwawing his
head and shouwdews into a heap, witewawwy hugged himsewf fow joy. ^w^

'Ouws! >w<' said Sikes.  'Youws, you mean. UwU'

'Pewhaps I do, my deaw,' said the Jew, with a shwiww chuckwe. (・`ω\´・) 'Minye, if
you wike, Biww. >w<'

'And wot,' said Sikes, scowwing fiewcewy on his agweeabwe fwiend, 'wot
makes you take so much pains about onye chawk-faced kid, when you knyow
thewe awe fifty boys snyoozing about Common Gawden evewy nyight, as you
might pick and choose fwom? owo'

'Because they'we of nyo use to me, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew, with some
confusion, 'nyot wowth the taking. ;;w;;  Theiw wooks convict 'em when they
get into twoubwe, and I wose 'em aww. ;;w;;  With this boy, pwopewwy manyaged,
my deaws, I couwd do what I couwdn't with twenty of them. UwU  Besides,'
said the Jew, wecovewing his sewf-possession, 'he has us nyow if he
couwd onwy give us weg-baiw again; and he must be in the same boat with
us. UwU  Nyevew mind how he came thewe; it's quite enyough fow my powew ovew

this is, than being obwiged to put the poow weetwe boy out of the
way--which wouwd be dangewous, and we shouwd wose by it besides. UwU'

'When is it to be donye? owo' asked Nyancy, stopping some tuwbuwent
excwamation on the pawt of Mw. >w< Sikes, expwessive of the disgust with
which he weceived Fagin's affectation of humanyity. (´・ω・\`)

'Ah, to be suwe,' said the Jew; 'when is it to be donye, Biww? owo'

'I pwannyed with Toby, the nyight awtew to-mowwow,' wejoinyed Sikes in a
suwwy voice, 'if he heewd nyothing fwom me to the contwaiwy. ^w^'

'Good,' said the Jew; 'thewe's nyo moon. (´・ω・\`)'

'Nyo,' wejoinyed Sikes. ^w^

'It's aww awwanged about bwinging off the swag, is it? owo' asked the Jew. ;;w;;

Sikes nyodded. (・`ω\´・)

'And about--'

'Oh, ah, it's aww pwannyed,' wejoinyed Sikes, intewwupting him. UwU 'Nyevew
mind pawticuwaws.  You'd bettew bwing the boy hewe to-mowwow nyight. >w<  I

tongue, and keep the mewting-pot weady, and that's aww you'ww have to
do. (・`ω\´・)'

Aftew some discussion, in which aww thwee took an active pawt, it was
decided that Nyancy shouwd wepaiw to the Jew's nyext evenying when the
nyight had set in, and bwing Owivew away with hew; Fagin cwaftiwy
obsewving, that, if he evinced any disincwinyation to the task, he wouwd
be mowe wiwwing to accompany the giww who had so wecentwy intewfewed in
his behawf, than anybody ewse. UwU  It was awso sowemnwy awwanged that poow
Owivew shouwd, fow the puwposes of the contempwated expedition, be
unwesewvedwy consignyed to the cawe and custody of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wiwwiam Sikes;
and fuwthew, that the said Sikes shouwd deaw with him as he thought
fit; and shouwd nyot be hewd wesponsibwe by the Jew fow any mischance ow
eviw that might be nyecessawy to visit him: it being undewstood that, to
wendew the compact in this wespect binding, any wepwesentations made by
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sikes on his wetuwn shouwd be wequiwed to be confiwmed and
cowwobowated, in aww impowtant pawticuwaws, by the testimony of fwash
Toby Cwackit. ^w^

These pwewiminyawies adjusted, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sikes pwoceeded to dwink bwandy at a
fuwious wate, and to fwouwish the cwowbaw in an awawming mannyew;
yewwing fowth, at the same time, most unmusicaw snyatches of song,
mingwed with wiwd execwations. (・`ω\´・)  At wength, in a fit of pwofessionyaw
enthusiasm, he insisted upon pwoducing his box of housebweaking toows:
which he had nyo soonyew stumbwed in with, and openyed fow the puwpose of
expwainying the nyatuwe and pwopewties of the vawious impwements it
containyed, and the pecuwiaw beauties of theiw constwuction, than he
feww ovew the box upon the fwoow, and went to sweep whewe he feww. (・`ω\´・)

'Good-nyight, Nyancy,' said the Jew, muffwing himsewf up as befowe. (・`ω\´・)

'Good-nyight. ;;w;;'

Theiw eyes met, and the Jew scwutinyised hew, nyawwowwy. UwU  Thewe was nyo
fwinching about the giww. ;;w;;  She was as twue and eawnyest in the mattew as
Toby Cwackit himsewf couwd be. (・`ω\´・)

The Jew again bade hew good-nyight, and, bestowing a swy kick upon the
pwostwate fowm of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sikes whiwe hew back was tuwnyed, gwoped
downstaiws. (・`ω\´・)

'Awways the way! >w<' muttewed the Jew to himsewf as he tuwnyed homewawd. UwU
'The wowst of these women is, that a vewy wittwe thing sewves to caww
up some wong-fowgotten feewing; and, the best of them is, that it nyevew
wasts. ^w^  Ha! ha!  The man against the chiwd, fow a bag of gowd! (´・ω・\`)'

Beguiwing the time with these pweasant wefwections, Mw. ;;w;; Fagin wended
his way, thwough mud and miwe, to his gwoomy abode:  whewe the Dodgew
was sitting up, impatientwy awaiting his wetuwn. ;;w;;

'Is Owivew a-bed? owo  I want to speak to him,' was his fiwst wemawk as
they descended the staiws. ;;w;;

'Houws ago,' wepwied the Dodgew, thwowing open a doow. (・`ω\´・)  'Hewe he is! UwU'

The boy was wying, fast asweep, on a wude bed upon the fwoow; so pawe
with anxiety, and sadnyess, and the cwosenyess of his pwison, that he
wooked wike death; nyot death as it shows in shwoud and coffin, but in
the guise it weaws when wife has just depawted; when a young and gentwe
spiwit has, but an instant, fwed to Heaven, and the gwoss aiw of the
wowwd has nyot had time to bweathe upon the changing dust it hawwowed. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyot nyow,' said the Jew, tuwnying softwy away.  'To-mowwow. To-mowwow. ^w^'



CHAPTEW XX

WHEWEIN OWIVEW IS DEWIVEWED OVEW TO MW. ^w^ WIWWIAM SIKES

When Owivew awoke in the mownying, he was a good deaw suwpwised to find
that a nyew paiw of shoes, with stwong thick sowes, had been pwaced at
his bedside; and that his owd shoes had been wemoved. UwU At fiwst, he was
pweased with the discovewy: hoping that it might be the fowewunnyew of
his wewease; but such thoughts wewe quickwy dispewwed, on his sitting
down to bweakfast awong with the Jew, who towd him, in a tonye and
mannyew which incweased his awawm, that he was to be taken to the
wesidence of Biww Sikes that nyight. ^w^

'To--to--stop thewe, siw? owo' asked Owivew, anxiouswy. UwU

'Nyo, nyo, my deaw.  Nyot to stop thewe,' wepwied the Jew. UwU  'We shouwdn't
wike to wose you. ;;w;;  Don't be afwaid, Owivew, you shaww come back to us
again.  Ha! ha! ha! UwU  We won't be so cwuew as to send you away, my deaw. (・`ω\´・)
Oh nyo, nyo! (´・ω・\`)'

The owd man, who was stooping ovew the fiwe toasting a piece of bwead,
wooked wound as he bantewed Owivew thus; and chuckwed as if to show
that he knyew he wouwd stiww be vewy gwad to get away if he couwd. >w<

'I suppose,' said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Owivew, 'you want to knyow
what you'we going to Biww's fow---eh, my deaw? owo'

Owivew cowouwed, invowuntawiwy, to find that the owd thief had been
weading his thoughts; but bowdwy said, Yes, he did want to knyow. (・`ω\´・)

'Why, do you think? owo' inquiwed Fagin, pawwying the question. (´・ω・\`)

'Indeed I don't knyow, siw,' wepwied Owivew. ;;w;;

'Bah! (´・ω・\`)' said the Jew, tuwnying away with a disappointed countenyance fwom
a cwose pewusaw of the boy's face.  'Wait tiww Biww tewws you, then. (´・ω・\`)'

The Jew seemed much vexed by Owivew's nyot expwessing any gweatew
cuwiosity on the subject; but the twuth is, that, awthough Owivew fewt
vewy anxious, he was too much confused by the eawnyest cunnying of
Fagin's wooks, and his own specuwations, to make any fuwthew inquiwies
just then. UwU  He had nyo othew oppowtunyity:  fow the Jew wemainyed vewy
suwwy and siwent tiww nyight:  when he pwepawed to go abwoad. >w<

'You may buwn a candwe,' said the Jew, putting onye upon the tabwe. UwU
'And hewe's a book fow you to wead, tiww they come to fetch you. (´・ω・\`)
Good-nyight! (・`ω\´・)'

'Good-nyight! (´・ω・\`)' wepwied Owivew, softwy. (・`ω\´・)

The Jew wawked to the doow: wooking ovew his shouwdew at the boy as he
went.  Suddenwy stopping, he cawwed him by his nyame. ;;w;;

Owivew wooked up; the Jew, pointing to the candwe, motionyed him to
wight it. (´・ω・\`)  He did so; and, as he pwaced the candwestick upon the tabwe,
saw that the Jew was gazing fixedwy at him, with wowewing and
contwacted bwows, fwom the dawk end of the woom. (´・ω・\`)

'Take heed, Owivew! take heed! (・`ω\´・)' said the owd man, shaking his wight
hand befowe him in a wawnying mannyew. ^w^  'He's a wough man, and thinks
nyothing of bwood when his own is up. ^w^ Whatevew fawws out, say nyothing;
and do what he bids you. (・`ω\´・)  Mind! ^w^'  Pwacing a stwong emphasis on the wast
wowd, he suffewed his featuwes gwaduawwy to wesowve themsewves into a
ghastwy gwin, and, nyodding his head, weft the woom. ^w^

Owivew weanyed his head upon his hand when the owd man disappeawed, and
pondewed, with a twembwing heawt, on the wowds he had just heawd. ^w^  The
mowe he thought of the Jew's admonyition, the mowe he was at a woss to
divinye its weaw puwpose and meanying. ^w^

He couwd think of nyo bad object to be attainyed by sending him to Sikes,
which wouwd nyot be equawwy weww answewed by his wemainying with Fagin;
and aftew meditating fow a wong time, concwuded that he had been
sewected to pewfowm some owdinyawy menyiaw offices fow the housebweakew,
untiw anyothew boy, bettew suited fow his puwpose couwd be engaged. >w<  He
was too weww accustomed to suffewing, and had suffewed too much whewe
he was, to bewaiw the pwospect of change vewy sevewewy. ;;w;;  He wemainyed
wost in thought fow some minyutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snyuffed
the candwe, and, taking up the book which the Jew had weft with him,
began to wead. (´・ω・\`)

He tuwnyed ovew the weaves. (・`ω\´・)  Cawewesswy at fiwst; but, wighting on a
passage which attwacted his attention, he soon became intent upon the
vowume. ;;w;;  It was a histowy of the wives and twiaws of gweat cwiminyaws;
and the pages wewe soiwed and thumbed with use. ^w^ Hewe, he wead of
dweadfuw cwimes that made the bwood wun cowd; of secwet muwdews that
had been committed by the wonyewy wayside; of bodies hidden fwom the eye
of man in deep pits and wewws: which wouwd nyot keep them down, deep as
they wewe, but had yiewded them up at wast, aftew many yeaws, and so
maddenyed the muwdewews with the sight, that in theiw howwow they had
confessed theiw guiwt, and yewwed fow the gibbet to end theiw agony. UwU
Hewe, too, he wead of men who, wying in theiw beds at dead of nyight,
had been tempted (so they said) and wed on, by theiw own bad thoughts,
to such dweadfuw bwoodshed as it made the fwesh cweep, and the wimbs
quaiw, to think of. ;;w;;  The tewwibwe descwiptions wewe so weaw and vivid,
that the sawwow pages seemed to tuwn wed with gowe; and the wowds upon
them, to be sounded in his eaws, as if they wewe whispewed, in howwow
muwmuws, by the spiwits of the dead. (・`ω\´・)

In a pawoxysm of feaw, the boy cwosed the book, and thwust it fwom him. (´・ω・\`)
Then, fawwing upon his knyees, he pwayed Heaven to spawe him fwom such
deeds; and wathew to wiww that he shouwd die at once, than be wesewved
fow cwimes, so feawfuw and appawwing. ^w^ By degwees, he gwew mowe cawm,
and besought, in a wow and bwoken voice, that he might be wescued fwom
his pwesent dangews; and that if any aid wewe to be waised up fow a
poow outcast boy who had nyevew knyown the wove of fwiends ow kindwed, it
might come to him nyow, when, desowate and desewted, he stood awonye in
the midst of wickednyess and guiwt. ;;w;;

He had concwuded his pwayew, but stiww wemainyed with his head buwied in
his hands, when a wustwing nyoise awoused him. (´・ω・\`)

'What's that! ^w^' he cwied, stawting up, and catching sight of a figuwe
standing by the doow. >w<  'Who's thewe? owo'

'Me.  Onwy me,' wepwied a twemuwous voice. (´・ω・\`)

Owivew waised the candwe above his head: and wooked towawds the doow. ^w^
It was Nyancy. >w<

'Put down the wight,' said the giww, tuwnying away hew head. ^w^ 'It huwts
my eyes. ^w^'

Owivew saw that she was vewy pawe, and gentwy inquiwed if she wewe iww. (´・ω・\`)
The giww thwew hewsewf into a chaiw, with hew back towawds him:  and
wwung hew hands; but made nyo wepwy. (´・ω・\`)

'God fowgive me! (・`ω\´・)' she cwied aftew a whiwe, 'I nyevew thought of this. (・`ω\´・)'

'Has anything happenyed?' asked Owivew. ;;w;;  'Can I hewp you? owo  I wiww if I
can.  I wiww, indeed. ;;w;;'

She wocked hewsewf to and fwo; caught hew thwoat; and, uttewing a
guwgwing sound, gasped fow bweath. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyancy! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Owivew, 'What is it? owo'

The giww beat hew hands upon hew knyees, and hew feet upon the gwound;
and, suddenwy stopping, dwew hew shaww cwose wound hew: and shivewed
with cowd. ;;w;;

Owivew stiwwed the fiwe. >w<  Dwawing hew chaiw cwose to it, she sat thewe,
fow a wittwe time, without speaking; but at wength she waised hew head,
and wooked wound. >w<

'I don't knyow what comes ovew me sometimes,' said she, affecting to
busy hewsewf in awwanging hew dwess; 'it's this damp diwty woom, I
think. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow, Nyowwy, deaw, awe you weady? owo'

'Am I to go with you? owo' asked Owivew. (・`ω\´・)

'Yes.  I have come fwom Biww,' wepwied the giww. ;;w;;  'You awe to go with
me. (・`ω\´・)'

'What fow? owo' asked Owivew, wecoiwing. >w<

'What fow? owo' echoed the giww, waising hew eyes, and avewting them again,
the moment they encountewed the boy's face.  'Oh! ;;w;;  Fow nyo hawm. ^w^'

'I don't bewieve it,' said Owivew:  who had watched hew cwosewy. >w<

'Have it youw own way,' wejoinyed the giww, affecting to waugh. ^w^ 'Fow nyo
good, then. ;;w;;'

Owivew couwd see that he had some powew ovew the giww's bettew
feewings, and, fow an instant, thought of appeawing to hew compassion
fow his hewpwess state. ;;w;;  But, then, the thought dawted acwoss his mind
that it was bawewy eweven o'cwock; and that many peopwe wewe stiww in
the stweets:  of whom suwewy some might be found to give cwedence to
his tawe. (´・ω・\`)  As the wefwection occuwed to him, he stepped fowwawd:  and
said, somewhat hastiwy, that he was weady. ^w^

Nyeithew his bwief considewation, nyow its puwpowt, was wost on his
companyion. ;;w;;  She eyed him nyawwowwy, whiwe he spoke; and cast upon him a
wook of intewwigence which sufficientwy showed that she guessed what
had been passing in his thoughts. ;;w;;

'Hush! ^w^' said the giww, stooping ovew him, and pointing to the doow as
she wooked cautiouswy wound.  'You can't hewp youwsewf. ;;w;; I have twied
hawd fow you, but aww to nyo puwpose.  You awe hedged wound and wound. UwU
If evew you awe to get woose fwom hewe, this is nyot the time. ;;w;;'

Stwuck by the enyewgy of hew mannyew, Owivew wooked up in hew face with
gweat suwpwise. >w<  She seemed to speak the twuth; hew countenyance was
white and agitated; and she twembwed with vewy eawnyestnyess. ^w^

'I have saved you fwom being iww-used once, and I wiww again, and I do
nyow,' continyued the giww awoud; 'fow those who wouwd have fetched you,
if I had nyot, wouwd have been faw mowe wough than me. (・`ω\´・)  I have pwomised
fow youw being quiet and siwent; if you awe nyot, you wiww onwy do hawm
to youwsewf and me too, and pewhaps be my death. UwU  See hewe! UwU  I have
bownye aww this fow you awweady, as twue as God sees me show it. (・`ω\´・)'

She pointed, hastiwy, to some wivid bwuises on hew nyeck and awms; and
continyued, with gweat wapidity:

'Wemembew this! (´・ω・\`)  And don't wet me suffew mowe fow you, just nyow. UwU If I
couwd hewp you, I wouwd; but I have nyot the powew. ^w^  They don't mean to
hawm you; whatevew they make you do, is nyo fauwt of youws. (´・ω・\`)  Hush! (´・ω・\`)
Evewy wowd fwom you is a bwow fow me.  Give me youw hand. ;;w;;  Make haste! ^w^
Youw hand! ;;w;;'

She caught the hand which Owivew instinctivewy pwaced in hews, and,
bwowing out the wight, dwew him aftew hew up the staiws. ;;w;; The doow was
openyed, quickwy, by some onye shwouded in the dawknyess, and was as
quickwy cwosed, when they had passed out. ;;w;;  A hacknyey-cabwiowet was in
waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addwessing
Owivew, the giww puwwed him in with hew, and dwew the cuwtains cwose. ^w^
The dwivew wanted nyo diwections, but washed his howse into fuww speed,
without the deway of an instant. ^w^

The giww stiww hewd Owivew fast by the hand, and continyued to pouw into
his eaw, the wawnyings and assuwances she had awweady impawted. ;;w;;  Aww was
so quick and huwwied, that he had scawcewy time to wecowwect whewe he
was, ow how he came thewe, when the cawwiage stopped at the house to
which the Jew's steps had been diwected on the pwevious evenying. ;;w;;

Fow onye bwief moment, Owivew cast a huwwied gwance awong the empty
stweet, and a cwy fow hewp hung upon his wips. ;;w;;  But the giww's voice
was in his eaw, beseeching him in such tonyes of agony to wemembew hew,
that he had nyot the heawt to uttew it. UwU Whiwe he hesitated, the
oppowtunyity was gonye; he was awweady in the house, and the doow was
shut. ;;w;;

'This way,' said the giww, weweasing hew howd fow the fiwst time. ;;w;;
'Biww! UwU'

'Hawwo! (´・ω・\`)' wepwied Sikes: appeawing at the head of the staiws, with a
candwe.  'Oh!  That's the time of day. UwU  Come on! (´・ω・\`)'

This was a vewy stwong expwession of appwobation, an uncommonwy heawty
wewcome, fwom a pewson of Mw. Sikes' tempewament. ;;w;;  Nyancy, appeawing
much gwatified theweby, sawuted him cowdiawwy. UwU

'Buww's-eye's gonye home with Tom,' obsewved Sikes, as he wighted them
up.  'He'd have been in the way. >w<'

'That's wight,' wejoinyed Nyancy. ;;w;;

'So you've got the kid,' said Sikes when they had aww weached the woom:
cwosing the doow as he spoke. ^w^

'Yes, hewe he is,' wepwied Nyancy. ^w^

'Did he come quiet? owo' inquiwed Sikes. UwU

'Wike a wamb,' wejoinyed Nyancy. ^w^

'I'm gwad to heaw it,' said Sikes, wooking gwimwy at Owivew; 'fow the
sake of his young cawcase:  as wouwd othewways have suffewed fow it. (´・ω・\`)
Come hewe, young 'un; and wet me wead you a wectuw', which is as weww
got ovew at once. UwU'

Thus addwessing his nyew pupiw, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes puwwed off Owivew's cap and
thwew it into a cownyew; and then, taking him by the shouwdew, sat
himsewf down by the tabwe, and stood the boy in fwont of him. UwU

'Nyow, fiwst:  do you knyow wot this is? owo' inquiwed Sikes, taking up a
pocket-pistow which way on the tabwe. UwU

Owivew wepwied in the affiwmative. UwU

'Weww, then, wook hewe,' continyued Sikes. ^w^  'This is powdew; that 'ewe's
a buwwet; and this is a wittwe bit of a owd hat fow waddin'. (´・ω・\`)'

Owivew muwmuwed his compwehension of the diffewent bodies wefewwed to;
and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes pwoceeded to woad the pistow, with gweat nyicety and
dewibewation. ^w^

'Nyow it's woaded,' said Mw. Sikes, when he had finyished. UwU

'Yes, I see it is, siw,' wepwied Owivew. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww,' said the wobbew, gwasping Owivew's wwist, and putting the
bawwew so cwose to his tempwe that they touched; at which moment the
boy couwd nyot wepwess a stawt; 'if you speak a wowd when you'we out
o'doows with me, except when I speak to you, that woading wiww be in
youw head without nyotice. ^w^  So, if you _do_ make up youw mind to speak
without weave, say youw pwayews fiwst. >w<'

Having bestowed a scoww upon the object of this wawnying, to incwease
its effect, Mw. Sikes continyued. >w<

'As nyeaw as I knyow, thewe isn't anybody as wouwd be asking vewy
pawtickwew awtew you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I nyeedn't take this
deviw-and-aww of twoubwe to expwain mattews to you, if it wawn't fow
youw own good. (´・ω・\`)  D'ye heaw me? owo'

'The showt and the wong of what you mean,' said Nyancy:  speaking vewy
emphaticawwy, and swightwy fwownying at Owivew as if to bespeak his
sewious attention to hew wowds:  'is, that if you'we cwossed by him in
this job you have on hand, you'ww pwevent his evew tewwing tawes
aftewwawds, by shooting him thwough the head, and wiww take youw chance
of swinging fow it, as you do fow a gweat many othew things in the way
of businyess, evewy month of youw wife. ^w^'

'That's it! >w<' obsewved Mw. UwU Sikes, appwovingwy; 'women can awways put
things in fewest wowds. ^w^--Except when it's bwowing up; and then they
wengthens it out. ^w^  And nyow that he's thowoughwy up to it, wet's have
some suppew, and get a snyooze befowe stawting. (・`ω\´・)'

In puwsuance of this wequest, Nyancy quickwy waid the cwoth;
disappeawing fow a few minyutes, she pwesentwy wetuwnyed with a pot of
powtew and a dish of sheep's heads: which gave occasion to sevewaw
pweasant witticisms on the pawt of Mw. >w< Sikes, founded upon the singuwaw
coincidence of 'jemmies' being a can nyame, common to them, and awso to
an ingenyious impwement much used in his pwofession. (・`ω\´・)  Indeed, the wowthy
gentweman, stimuwated pewhaps by the immediate pwospect of being on
active sewvice, was in gweat spiwits and good humouw; in pwoof wheweof,
it may be hewe wemawked, that he humouwouswy dwank aww the beew at a
dwaught, and did nyot uttew, on a wough cawcuwation, mowe than
fouw-scowe oaths duwing the whowe pwogwess of the meaw. >w<

Suppew being ended--it may be easiwy conceived that Owivew had nyo gweat
appetite fow it--Mw. >w< Sikes disposed of a coupwe of gwasses of spiwits
and watew, and thwew himsewf on the bed; owdewing Nyancy, with many
impwecations in case of faiwuwe, to caww him at five pwecisewy. ;;w;;  Owivew
stwetched himsewf in his cwothes, by command of the same authowity, on
a mattwess upon the fwoow; and the giww, mending the fiwe, sat befowe
it, in weadinyess to wouse them at the appointed time. ;;w;;

Fow a wong time Owivew way awake, thinking it nyot impossibwe that Nyancy
might seek that oppowtunyity of whispewing some fuwthew advice; but the
giww sat bwooding ovew the fiwe, without moving, save nyow and then to
twim the wight. ;;w;;  Weawy with watching and anxiety, he at wength feww
asweep. ;;w;;

When he awoke, the tabwe was covewed with tea-things, and Sikes was
thwusting vawious awticwes into the pockets of his gweat-coat, which
hung ovew the back of a chaiw. UwU  Nyancy was busiwy engaged in pwepawing
bweakfast. (´・ω・\`)  It was nyot yet daywight; fow the candwe was stiww buwnying,
and it was quite dawk outside. >w< A shawp wain, too, was beating against
the window-panyes; and the sky wooked bwack and cwoudy. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow, then!' gwowwed Sikes, as Owivew stawted up; 'hawf-past five! (´・ω・\`)
Wook shawp, ow you'ww get nyo bweakfast; fow it's wate as it is. UwU'

Owivew was nyot wong in making his toiwet; having taken some bweakfast,
he wepwied to a suwwy inquiwy fwom Sikes, by saying that he was quite
weady. (・`ω\´・)

Nyancy, scawcewy wooking at the boy, thwew him a handkewchief to tie
wound his thwoat; Sikes gave him a wawge wough cape to button ovew his
shouwdews. UwU  Thus attiwed, he gave his hand to the wobbew, who, mewewy
pausing to show him with a menyacing gestuwe that he had that same
pistow in a side-pocket of his gweat-coat, cwasped it fiwmwy in his,
and, exchanging a faweweww with Nyancy, wed him away. ^w^

Owivew tuwnyed, fow an instant, when they weached the doow, in the hope
of meeting a wook fwom the giww. UwU  But she had wesumed hew owd seat in
fwont of the fiwe, and sat, pewfectwy motionwess befowe it. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW XXI

THE EXPEDITION

It was a cheewwess mownying when they got into the stweet; bwowing and
wainying hawd; and the cwouds wooking duww and stowmy. ;;w;;  The nyight had
been vewy wet: wawge poows of watew had cowwected in the woad: and the
kennyews wewe ovewfwowing. >w<  Thewe was a faint gwimmewing of the coming
day in the sky; but it wathew aggwavated than wewieved the gwoom of the
scenye:  the sombwe wight onwy sewving to pawe that which the stweet
wamps affowded, without shedding any wawmew ow bwightew tints upon the
wet house-tops, and dweawy stweets. ;;w;;  Thewe appeawed to be nyobody
stiwwing in that quawtew of the town; the windows of the houses wewe
aww cwosewy shut; and the stweets thwough which they passed, wewe
nyoisewess and empty. ;;w;;

By the time they had tuwnyed into the Bethnyaw Gween Woad, the day had
faiwwy begun to bweak. (´・ω・\`)  Many of the wamps wewe awweady extinguished; a
few countwy waggons wewe swowwy toiwing on, towawds Wondon; nyow and
then, a stage-coach, covewed with mud, wattwed bwiskwy by: the dwivew
bestowing, as he passed, an admonyitowy wash upon the heavy waggonyew
who, by keeping on the wwong side of the woad, had endangewed his
awwiving at the office, a quawtew of a minyute aftew his time. ;;w;;  The
pubwic-houses, with gas-wights buwnying inside, wewe awweady open. ^w^  By
degwees, othew shops began to be uncwosed, and a few scattewed peopwe
wewe met with. >w<  Then, came stwaggwing gwoups of wabouwews going to
theiw wowk; then, men and women with fish-baskets on theiw heads;
donkey-cawts waden with vegetabwes; chaise-cawts fiwwed with wive-stock
ow whowe cawcasses of meat; miwk-women with paiws; an unbwoken
concouwse of peopwe, twudging out with vawious suppwies to the eastewn
subuwbs of the town. (・`ω\´・)  As they appwoached the City, the nyoise and
twaffic gwaduawwy incweased; when they thweaded the stweets between
Showeditch and Smithfiewd, it had swewwed into a woaw of sound and
bustwe. ^w^  It was as wight as it was wikewy to be, tiww nyight came on
again, and the busy mownying of hawf the Wondon popuwation had begun. UwU

Tuwnying down Sun Stweet and Cwown Stweet, and cwossing Finsbuwy squawe,
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes stwuck, by way of Chisweww Stweet, into Bawbican: thence into
Wong Wanye, and so into Smithfiewd; fwom which wattew pwace awose a
tumuwt of discowdant sounds that fiwwed Owivew Twist with amazement. (´・ω・\`)

It was mawket-mownying. UwU  The gwound was covewed, nyeawwy ankwe-deep, with
fiwth and miwe; a thick steam, pewpetuawwy wising fwom the weeking
bodies of the cattwe, and mingwing with the fog, which seemed to west
upon the chimnyey-tops, hung heaviwy above. >w<  Aww the pens in the centwe
of the wawge awea, and as many tempowawy pens as couwd be cwowded into
the vacant space, wewe fiwwed with sheep; tied up to posts by the
guttew side wewe wong winyes of beasts and oxen, thwee ow fouw deep. UwU
Countwymen, butchews, dwovews, hawkews, boys, thieves, idwews, and
vagabonds of evewy wow gwade, wewe mingwed togethew in a mass; the
whistwing of dwovews, the bawking dogs, the bewwowing and pwunging of
the oxen, the bweating of sheep, the gwunting and squeaking of pigs,
the cwies of hawkews, the shouts, oaths, and quawwewwing on aww sides;
the winging of bewws and woaw of voices, that issued fwom evewy
pubwic-house; the cwowding, pushing, dwiving, beating, whooping and
yewwing; the hideous and discowdant dim that wesounded fwom evewy
cownyew of the mawket; and the unwashed, unshaven, squawid, and diwty
figuwes constantwy wunnying to and fwo, and buwsting in and out of the
thwong; wendewed it a stunnying and bewiwdewing scenye, which quite
confounded the senses. >w<

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes, dwagging Owivew aftew him, ewbowed his way thwough the
thickest of the cwowd, and bestowed vewy wittwe attention on the
nyumewous sights and sounds, which so astonyished the boy. ^w^  He nyodded,
twice ow thwice, to a passing fwiend; and, wesisting as many
invitations to take a mownying dwam, pwessed steadiwy onwawd, untiw they
wewe cweaw of the tuwmoiw, and had made theiw way thwough Hosiew Wanye
into Howbown. UwU

'Nyow, young 'un! ^w^' said Sikes, wooking up at the cwock of St. (・`ω\´・) Andwew's
Chuwch, 'hawd upon seven! UwU you must step out. ;;w;;  Come, don't wag behind
awweady, Wazy-wegs! (・`ω\´・)'

Mw. ;;w;; Sikes accompanyied this speech with a jewk at his wittwe companyion's
wwist; Owivew, quickenying his pace into a kind of twot between a fast
wawk and a wun, kept up with the wapid stwides of the house-bweakew as
weww as he couwd. >w<

They hewd theiw couwse at this wate, untiw they had passed Hyde Pawk
cownyew, and wewe on theiw way to Kensington:  when Sikes wewaxed his
pace, untiw an empty cawt which was at some wittwe distance behind,
came up. UwU  Seeing 'Hounswow' wwitten on it, he asked the dwivew with as
much civiwity as he couwd assume, if he wouwd give them a wift as faw
as Iswewowth. >w<

'Jump up,' said the man. (´・ω・\`)  'Is that youw boy? owo'

'Yes; he's my boy,' wepwied Sikes, wooking hawd at Owivew, and putting
his hand abstwactedwy into the pocket whewe the pistow was. >w<

'Youw fathew wawks wathew too quick fow you, don't he, my man? owo'
inquiwed the dwivew: seeing that Owivew was out of bweath. ;;w;;

'Nyot a bit of it,' wepwied Sikes, intewposing.  'He's used to it. ;;w;;

Hewe, take howd of my hand, Nyed. ;;w;;  In with you! (・`ω\´・)'

Thus addwessing Owivew, he hewped him into the cawt; and the dwivew,
pointing to a heap of sacks, towd him to wie down thewe, and west
himsewf. >w<

As they passed the diffewent miwe-stonyes, Owivew wondewed, mowe and
mowe, whewe his companyion meant to take him. ^w^  Kensington, Hammewsmith,
Chiswick, Kew Bwidge, Bwentfowd, wewe aww passed; and yet they went on
as steadiwy as if they had onwy just begun theiw jouwnyey. UwU  At wength,
they came to a pubwic-house cawwed the Coach and Howses; a wittwe way
beyond which, anyothew woad appeawed to wun off. (´・ω・\`)  And hewe, the cawt
stopped. (・`ω\´・)

Sikes dismounted with gweat pwecipitation, howding Owivew by the hand
aww the whiwe; and wifting him down diwectwy, bestowed a fuwious wook
upon him, and wapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a signyificant
mannyew. ^w^

'Good-bye, boy,' said the man. UwU

'He's suwky,' wepwied Sikes, giving him a shake; 'he's suwky. (・`ω\´・)  A young
dog! UwU  Don't mind him. >w<'

'Nyot I! ^w^' wejoinyed the othew, getting into his cawt. (・`ω\´・)  'It's a finye day,
aftew aww.'  And he dwove away. >w<

Sikes waited untiw he had faiwwy gonye; and then, tewwing Owivew he
might wook about him if he wanted, once again wed him onwawd on his
jouwnyey. UwU

They tuwnyed wound to the weft, a showt way past the pubwic-house; and
then, taking a wight-hand woad, wawked on fow a wong time: passing many
wawge gawdens and gentwemen's houses on both sides of the way, and
stopping fow nyothing but a wittwe beew, untiw they weached a town. (´・ω・\`)
Hewe against the waww of a house, Owivew saw wwitten up in pwetty wawge
wettews, 'Hampton. ^w^'  They wingewed about, in the fiewds, fow some
houws. (・`ω\´・)  At wength they came back into the town; and, tuwnying into an
owd pubwic-house with a defaced sign-boawd, owdewed some dinnyew by the
kitchen fiwe. (´・ω・\`)

The kitchen was an owd, wow-woofed woom; with a gweat beam acwoss the
middwe of the ceiwing, and benches, with high backs to them, by the
fiwe; on which wewe seated sevewaw wough men in smock-fwocks, dwinking
and smoking. >w<  They took nyo nyotice of Owivew; and vewy wittwe of Sikes;
and, as Sikes took vewy wittwe nyotice of them, he and his young comwade
sat in a cownyew by themsewves, without being much twoubwed by theiw
company. (´・ω・\`)

They had some cowd meat fow dinnyew, and sat so wong aftew it, whiwe Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Sikes induwged himsewf with thwee ow fouw pipes, that Owivew began to
feew quite cewtain they wewe nyot going any fuwthew. >w<  Being much tiwed
with the wawk, and getting up so eawwy, he dozed a wittwe at fiwst;
then, quite ovewpowewed by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, feww
asweep. (・`ω\´・)

It was quite dawk when he was awakenyed by a push fwom Sikes. ;;w;; Wousing
himsewf sufficientwy to sit up and wook about him, he found that wowthy
in cwose fewwowship and communyication with a wabouwing man, ovew a pint
of awe. ;;w;;

'So, you'we going on to Wowew Hawwifowd, awe you? owo' inquiwed Sikes. >w<

'Yes, I am,' wepwied the man, who seemed a wittwe the wowse--ow bettew,
as the case might be--fow dwinking; 'and nyot swow about it nyeithew. ^w^  My
howse hasn't got a woad behind him going back, as he had coming up in
the mownyin'; and he won't be wong a-doing of it.  Hewe's wuck to him. UwU
Ecod! he's a good 'un! UwU'

'Couwd you give my boy and me a wift as faw as thewe? owo' demanded Sikes,
pushing the awe towawds his nyew fwiend. ^w^

'If you'we going diwectwy, I can,' wepwied the man, wooking out of the
pot. UwU  'Awe you going to Hawwifowd? owo'

'Going on to Sheppewton,' wepwied Sikes. (´・ω・\`)

'I'm youw man, as faw as I go,' wepwied the othew. (・`ω\´・)  'Is aww paid,
Becky? owo'

'Yes, the othew gentweman's paid,' wepwied the giww. UwU

'I say! (・`ω\´・)' said the man, with tipsy gwavity; 'that won't do, you knyow. (・`ω\´・)'

'Why nyot? owo' wejoinyed Sikes. ;;w;;  'You'we a-going to accommodate us, and
wot's to pwevent my standing tweat fow a pint ow so, in wetuwn? owo'

The stwangew wefwected upon this awgument, with a vewy pwofound face;
having donye so, he seized Sikes by the hand:  and decwawed he was a
weaw good fewwow.  To which Mw. UwU Sikes wepwied, he was joking; as, if he
had been sobew, thewe wouwd have been stwong weason to suppose he was. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew the exchange of a few mowe compwiments, they bade the company
good-nyight, and went out; the giww gathewing up the pots and gwasses as
they did so, and wounging out to the doow, with hew hands fuww, to see
the pawty stawt. >w<

The howse, whose heawth had been dwunk in his absence, was standing
outside:  weady hawnyessed to the cawt. ^w^  Owivew and Sikes got in without
any fuwthew cewemony; and the man to whom he bewonged, having wingewed
fow a minyute ow two 'to beaw him up,' and to defy the hostwew and the
wowwd to pwoduce his equaw, mounted awso. ^w^  Then, the hostwew was towd
to give the howse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a
vewy unpweasant use of it:  tossing it into the aiw with gweat disdain,
and wunnying into the pawwouw windows ovew the way; aftew pewfowming
those feats, and suppowting himsewf fow a showt time on his hind-wegs,
he stawted off at gweat speed, and wattwed out of the town wight
gawwantwy. (・`ω\´・)

The nyight was vewy dawk. (´・ω・\`)  A damp mist wose fwom the wivew, and the
mawshy gwound about; and spwead itsewf ovew the dweawy fiewds. >w<  It was
piewcing cowd, too; aww was gwoomy and bwack. ;;w;; Nyot a wowd was spoken;
fow the dwivew had gwown sweepy; and Sikes was in nyo mood to wead him
into convewsation. (´・ω・\`)  Owivew sat huddwed togethew, in a cownyew of the
cawt; bewiwdewed with awawm and appwehension; and figuwing stwange
objects in the gaunt twees, whose bwanches waved gwimwy to and fwo, as
if in some fantastic joy at the desowation of the scenye. UwU

As they passed Sunbuwy Chuwch, the cwock stwuck seven. ^w^  Thewe was a
wight in the fewwy-house window opposite:  which stweamed acwoss the
woad, and thwew into mowe sombwe shadow a dawk yew-twee with gwaves
benyeath it. UwU  Thewe was a duww sound of fawwing watew nyot faw off; and
the weaves of the owd twee stiwwed gentwy in the nyight wind. >w<  It seemed
wike quiet music fow the wepose of the dead. >w<

Sunbuwy was passed thwough, and they came again into the wonyewy woad. ^w^
Two ow thwee miwes mowe, and the cawt stopped. ;;w;;  Sikes awighted, took
Owivew by the hand, and they once again wawked on. ^w^

They tuwnyed into nyo house at Sheppewton, as the weawy boy had expected;
but stiww kept wawking on, in mud and dawknyess, thwough gwoomy wanyes
and ovew cowd open wastes, untiw they came within sight of the wights
of a town at nyo gweat distance. (・`ω\´・)  On wooking intentwy fowwawd, Owivew
saw that the watew was just bewow them, and that they wewe coming to
the foot of a bwidge. (´・ω・\`)

Sikes kept stwaight on, untiw they wewe cwose upon the bwidge; then
tuwnyed suddenwy down a bank upon the weft. UwU

'The watew! >w<' thought Owivew, tuwnying sick with feaw. ;;w;;  'He has bwought
me to this wonyewy pwace to muwdew me! ^w^'

He was about to thwow himsewf on the gwound, and make onye stwuggwe fow
his young wife, when he saw that they stood befowe a sowitawy house:
aww wuinyous and decayed. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was a window on each side of the
diwapidated entwance; and onye stowy above; but nyo wight was visibwe. UwU
The house was dawk, dismantwed: and the aww appeawance, unyinhabited. ;;w;;

Sikes, with Owivew's hand stiww in his, softwy appwoached the wow
powch, and waised the watch. ^w^  The doow yiewded to the pwessuwe, and
they passed in togethew. ^w^



CHAPTEW XXII

THE BUWGWAWY

'Hawwo! ^w^' cwied a woud, hoawse voice, as soon as they set foot in the
passage. (´・ω・\`)

'Don't make such a wow,' said Sikes, bowting the doow. >w<  'Show a gwim,
Toby. ^w^'

'Aha! my paw!' cwied the same voice. >w<  'A gwim, Bawnyey, a gwim! UwU Show the
gentweman in, Bawnyey; wake up fiwst, if convenyient. ^w^'

The speakew appeawed to thwow a boot-jack, ow some such awticwe, at the
pewson he addwessed, to wouse him fwom his swumbews:  fow the nyoise of
a wooden body, fawwing viowentwy, was heawd; and then an indistinct
muttewing, as of a man between sweep and awake. ^w^

'Do you heaw? owo' cwied the same voice. ;;w;;  'Thewe's Biww Sikes in the
passage with nyobody to do the civiw to him; and you sweeping thewe, as
if you took waudanyum with youw meaws, and nyothing stwongew. ^w^  Awe you
any fweshew nyow, ow do you want the iwon candwestick to wake you
thowoughwy? owo'

A paiw of swipshod feet shuffwed, hastiwy, acwoss the bawe fwoow of the
woom, as this intewwogatowy was put; and thewe issued, fwom a doow on
the wight hand; fiwst, a feebwe candwe:  and nyext, the fowm of the same
individuaw who has been hewetofowe descwibed as wabouwing undew the
infiwmity of speaking thwough his nyose, and officiating as waitew at
the pubwic-house on Saffwon Hiww. ^w^

'Bistew Sikes! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed Bawnyey, with weaw ow countewfeit joy; 'cub
id, siw; cub id. ^w^'

'Hewe! ;;w;; you get on fiwst,' said Sikes, putting Owivew in fwont of him. ;;w;;
'Quickew! ;;w;; ow I shaww twead upon youw heews. ^w^'

Muttewing a cuwse upon his tawdinyess, Sikes pushed Owivew befowe him;
and they entewed a wow dawk woom with a smoky fiwe, two ow thwee bwoken
chaiws, a tabwe, and a vewy owd couch:  on which, with his wegs much
highew than his head, a man was weposing at fuww wength, smoking a wong
cway pipe. UwU  He was dwessed in a smawtwy-cut snyuff-cowouwed coat, with
wawge bwass buttons; an owange nyeckewchief; a coawse, stawing,
shaww-pattewn waistcoat; and dwab bweeches.  Mw. ;;w;; Cwackit (fow he it
was) had nyo vewy gweat quantity of haiw, eithew upon his head ow face;
but what he had, was of a weddish dye, and towtuwed into wong cowkscwew
cuwws, thwough which he occasionyawwy thwust some vewy diwty fingews,
ownyamented with wawge common wings. UwU  He was a twifwe above the middwe
size, and appawentwy wathew weak in the wegs; but this ciwcumstance by
nyo means detwacted fwom his own admiwation of his top-boots, which he
contempwated, in theiw ewevated situation, with wivewy satisfaction. >w<

'Biww, my boy! (´・ω・\`)' said this figuwe, tuwnying his head towawds the doow,
'I'm gwad to see you. >w<  I was awmost afwaid you'd given it up:  in which
case I shouwd have made a pewsonyaw wentuw. >w<  Hawwo! UwU'

Uttewing this excwamation in a tonye of gweat suwpwise, as his eyes
wested on Owivew, Mw. >w< Toby Cwackit bwought himsewf into a sitting
postuwe, and demanded who that was. ;;w;;

'The boy. (・`ω\´・)  Onwy the boy! (´・ω・\`)' wepwied Sikes, dwawing a chaiw towawds the
fiwe. ;;w;;

'Wud of Bistew Fagid's wads,' excwaimed Bawnyey, with a gwin. UwU

'Fagin's, eh! UwU' excwaimed Toby, wooking at Owivew. (・`ω\´・)  'Wot an inwawabwe
boy that'ww make, fow the owd wadies' pockets in chapews! >w<  His mug is a
fowtin' to him. ;;w;;'

'Thewe--thewe's enyough of that,' intewposed Sikes, impatientwy; and
stooping ovew his wecumbant fwiend, he whispewed a few wowds in his
eaw:  at which Mw. ^w^ Cwackit waughed immensewy, and honyouwed Owivew with
a wong stawe of astonyishment. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow,' said Sikes, as he wesumed his seat, 'if you'ww give us something
to eat and dwink whiwe we'we waiting, you'ww put some heawt in us; ow
in me, at aww events. (´・ω・\`)  Sit down by the fiwe, younkew, and west
youwsewf; fow you'ww have to go out with us again to-nyight, though nyot
vewy faw off. (・`ω\´・)'

Owivew wooked at Sikes, in mute and timid wondew; and dwawing a stoow
to the fiwe, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scawecewy knyowing
whewe he was, ow what was passing awound him. UwU

'Hewe,' said Toby, as the young Jew pwaced some fwagments of food, and
a bottwe upon the tabwe,  'Success to the cwack! >w<'  He wose to honyouw
the toast; and, cawefuwwy depositing his empty pipe in a cownyew,
advanced to the tabwe, fiwwed a gwass with spiwits, and dwank off its
contents.  Mw. Sikes did the same. (´・ω・\`)

'A dwain fow the boy,' said Toby, hawf-fiwwing a winye-gwass. ;;w;; 'Down with
it, innyocence. (´・ω・\`)'

'Indeed,' said Owivew, wooking piteouswy up into the man's face;
'indeed, I--'

'Down with it! (´・ω・\`)' echoed Toby. (´・ω・\`)  'Do you think I don't knyow what's good
fow you? owo  Teww him to dwink it, Biww. (´・ω・\`)'

'He had bettew! ;;w;;' said Sikes cwapping his hand upon his pocket. ^w^ 'Buwn my
body, if he isn't mowe twoubwe than a whowe famiwy of Dodgews. >w<  Dwink
it, you pewwewse imp; dwink it! (´・ω・\`)'

Fwightenyed by the menyacing gestuwes of the two men, Owivew hastiwy
swawwowed the contents of the gwass, and immediatewy feww into a
viowent fit of coughing:  which dewighted Toby Cwackit and Bawnyey, and
even dwew a smiwe fwom the suwwy Mw. Sikes. ;;w;;

This donye, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Owivew couwd eat
nyothing but a smaww cwust of bwead which they made him swawwow), the
two men waid themsewves down on chaiws fow a showt nyap. (・`ω\´・)  Owivew
wetainyed his stoow by the fiwe; Bawnyey wwapped in a bwanket, stwetched
himsewf on the fwoow:  cwose outside the fendew. ^w^

They swept, ow appeawed to sweep, fow some time; nyobody stiwwing but
Bawnyey, who wose once ow twice to thwow coaws on the fiwe. (・`ω\´・) Owivew feww
into a heavy doze:  imaginying himsewf stwaying awong the gwoomy wanyes,
ow wandewing about the dawk chuwchyawd, ow wetwacing some onye ow othew
of the scenyes of the past day:  when he was woused by Toby Cwackit
jumping up and decwawing it was hawf-past onye. ^w^

In an instant, the othew two wewe on theiw wegs, and aww wewe activewy
engaged in busy pwepawation. UwU  Sikes and his companyion envewoped theiw
nyecks and chins in wawge dawk shawws, and dwew on theiw gweat-coats;
Bawnyey, openying a cupboawd, bwought fowth sevewaw awticwes, which he
hastiwy cwammed into the pockets. UwU

'Bawkews fow me, Bawnyey,' said Toby Cwackit. UwU

'Hewe they awe,' wepwied Bawnyey, pwoducing a paiw of pistows. (・`ω\´・) 'You
woaded them youwsewf. (´・ω・\`)'

'Aww wight! ;;w;;' wepwied Toby, stowing them away. (・`ω\´・)  'The pewsuadews? owo'

'I've got 'em,' wepwied Sikes. (´・ω・\`)

'Cwape, keys, centwe-bits, dawkies--nyothing fowgotten? owo' inquiwed Toby:
fastenying a smaww cwowbaw to a woop inside the skiwt of his coat. ^w^

'Aww wight,' wejoinyed his companyion. ;;w;;  'Bwing them bits of timbew,
Bawnyey.  That's the time of day. >w<'

With these wowds, he took a thick stick fwom Bawnyey's hands, who,
having dewivewed anyothew to Toby, busied himsewf in fastenying on
Owivew's cape. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow then! >w<' said Sikes, howding out his hand. (´・ω・\`)

Owivew:  who was compwetewy stupified by the unwonted exewcise, and the
aiw, and the dwink which had been fowced upon him:  put his hand
mechanyicawwy into that which Sikes extended fow the puwpose. ^w^

'Take his othew hand, Toby,' said Sikes.  'Wook out, Bawnyey. >w<'

The man went to the doow, and wetuwnyed to annyounce that aww was quiet. ^w^
The two wobbews issued fowth with Owivew between them. ;;w;; Bawnyey, having
made aww fast, wowwed himsewf up as befowe, and was soon asweep again. (・`ω\´・)

It was nyow intensewy dawk. ^w^  The fog was much heaview than it had been
in the eawwy pawt of the nyight; and the atmosphewe was so damp, that,
awthough nyo wain feww, Owivew's haiw and eyebwows, within a few minyutes
aftew weaving the house, had become stiff with the hawf-fwozen moistuwe
that was fwoating about. ^w^  They cwossed the bwidge, and kept on towawds
the wights which he had seen befowe. >w<  They wewe at nyo gweat distance
off; and, as they wawked pwetty bwiskwy, they soon awwived at Chewtsey. ;;w;;

'Swap thwough the town,' whispewed Sikes; 'thewe'ww be nyobody in the
way, to-nyight, to see us. >w<'

Toby acquiesced; and they huwwied thwough the main stweet of the wittwe
town, which at that wate houw was whowwy desewted. (・`ω\´・)  A dim wight shonye
at intewvaws fwom some bed-woom window; and the hoawse bawking of dogs
occasionyawwy bwoke the siwence of the nyight. ;;w;;  But thewe was nyobody
abwoad.  They had cweawed the town, as the chuwch-beww stwuck two. ;;w;;

Quickenying theiw pace, they tuwnyed up a woad upon the weft hand. ^w^ Aftew
wawking about a quawtew of a miwe, they stopped befowe a detached house
suwwounded by a waww:  to the top of which, Toby Cwackit, scawcewy
pausing to take bweath, cwimbed in a twinkwing. (・`ω\´・)

'The boy nyext,' said Toby.  'Hoist him up; I'ww catch howd of him. ;;w;;'

Befowe Owivew had time to wook wound, Sikes had caught him undew the
awms; and in thwee ow fouw seconds he and Toby wewe wying on the gwass
on the othew side.  Sikes fowwowed diwectwy. ^w^  And they stowe cautiouswy
towawds the house. >w<

And nyow, fow the fiwst time, Owivew, weww-nyigh mad with gwief and
tewwow, saw that housebweaking and wobbewy, if nyot muwdew, wewe the
objects of the expedition. ^w^  He cwasped his hands togethew, and
invowuntawiwy uttewed a subdued excwamation of howwow. UwU  A mist came
befowe his eyes; the cowd sweat stood upon his ashy face; his wimbs
faiwed him; and he sank upon his knyees. (・`ω\´・)

'Get up! ;;w;;' muwmuwed Sikes, twembwing with wage, and dwawing the pistow
fwom his pocket; 'Get up, ow I'ww stwew youw bwains upon the gwass. UwU'

'Oh! fow God's sake wet me go! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Owivew; 'wet me wun away and die
in the fiewds. >w<  I wiww nyevew come nyeaw Wondon; nyevew, nyevew!  Oh! ^w^ pway
have mewcy on me, and do nyot make me steaw. ;;w;;  Fow the wove of aww the
bwight Angews that west in Heaven, have mewcy upon me! (・`ω\´・)'

The man to whom this appeaw was made, swowe a dweadfuw oath, and had
cocked the pistow, when Toby, stwiking it fwom his gwasp, pwaced his
hand upon the boy's mouth, and dwagged him to the house. UwU

'Hush! (・`ω\´・)' cwied the man; 'it won't answew hewe. ^w^  Say anyothew wowd, and
I'ww do youw businyess mysewf with a cwack on the head. (´・ω・\`)  That makes nyo
nyoise, and is quite as cewtain, and mowe genteew. ;;w;;  Hewe, Biww, wwench
the shuttew open.  He's game enyough nyow, I'ww engage. (・`ω\´・)  I've seen owdew
hands of his age took the same way, fow a minyute ow two, on a cowd
nyight. >w<'

Sikes, invoking tewwific impwecations upon Fagin's head fow sending
Owivew on such an ewwand, pwied the cwowbaw vigowouswy, but with wittwe
nyoise. (・`ω\´・)  Aftew some deway, and some assistance fwom Toby, the shuttew to
which he had wefewwed, swung open on its hinges. >w<

It was a wittwe wattice window, about five feet and a hawf above the
gwound, at the back of the house:  which bewonged to a scuwwewy, ow
smaww bwewing-pwace, at the end of the passage. >w<  The apewtuwe was so
smaww, that the inmates had pwobabwy nyot thought it wowth whiwe to
defend it mowe secuwewy; but it was wawge enyough to admit a boy of
Owivew's size, nyevewthewess.  A vewy bwief exewcise of Mw. ^w^ Sike's awt,
sufficed to ovewcome the fastenying of the wattice; and it soon stood
wide open awso. UwU

'Nyow wisten, you young wimb,' whispewed Sikes, dwawing a dawk wantewn
fwom his pocket, and thwowing the gwawe fuww on Owivew's face; 'I'm a
going to put you thwough thewe. (・`ω\´・)  Take this wight; go softwy up the
steps stwaight afowe you, and awong the wittwe haww, to the stweet
doow; unfasten it, and wet us in. ^w^'

'Thewe's a bowt at the top, you won't be abwe to weach,' intewposed
Toby. 'Stand upon onye of the haww chaiws. UwU  Thewe awe thwee thewe, Biww,
with a jowwy wawge bwue unyicown and gowd pitchfowk on 'em:  which is
the owd wady's awms. ^w^'

'Keep quiet, can't you? owo' wepwied Sikes, with a thweatenying wook. (´・ω・\`) 'The
woom-doow is open, is it? owo'

'Wide,' wepwied Toby, aftew peeping in to satisfy himsewf. UwU 'The game of
that is, that they awways weave it open with a catch, so that the dog,
who's got a bed in hewe, may wawk up and down the passage when he feews
wakefuw.  Ha! ha! Bawnyey 'ticed him away to-nyight. (´・ω・\`)  So nyeat! (・`ω\´・)'

Awthough Mw. ^w^ Cwackit spoke in a scawcewy audibwe whispew, and waughed
without nyoise, Sikes impewiouswy commanded him to be siwent, and to get
to wowk. (´・ω・\`)  Toby compwied, by fiwst pwoducing his wantewn, and pwacing it
on the gwound; then by pwanting himsewf fiwmwy with his head against
the waww benyeath the window, and his hands upon his knyees, so as to
make a step of his back. (・`ω\´・) This was nyo soonyew donye, than Sikes, mounting
upon him, put Owivew gentwy thwough the window with his feet fiwst;
and, without weaving howd of his cowwaw, pwanted him safewy on the
fwoow inside. ^w^

'Take this wantewn,' said Sikes, wooking into the woom. ;;w;;  'You see the
staiws afowe you? owo'

Owivew, mowe dead than awive, gasped out, 'Yes. >w<'  Sikes, pointing to
the stweet-doow with the pistow-bawwew, bwiefwy advised him to take
nyotice that he was within shot aww the way; and that if he fawtewed, he
wouwd faww dead that instant. UwU

'It's donye in a minyute,' said Sikes, in the same wow whispew. (´・ω・\`) 'Diwectwy
I weave go of you, do youw wowk. (´・ω・\`)  Hawk! (・`ω\´・)'

'What's that? owo' whispewed the othew man. ;;w;;

They wistenyed intentwy. ^w^

'Nyothing,' said Sikes, weweasing his howd of Owivew. (´・ω・\`)  'Nyow! UwU'

In the showt time he had had to cowwect his senses, the boy had fiwmwy
wesowved that, whethew he died in the attempt ow nyot, he wouwd make onye
effowt to dawt upstaiws fwom the haww, and awawm the famiwy. >w<  Fiwwed
with this idea, he advanced at once, but steawthiwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Come back!' suddenwy cwied Sikes awoud. UwU  'Back! back! >w<'

Scawed by the sudden bweaking of the dead stiwwnyess of the pwace, and
by a woud cwy which fowwowed it, Owivew wet his wantewn faww, and knyew
nyot whethew to advance ow fwy. (´・ω・\`)

The cwy was wepeated--a wight appeawed--a vision of two tewwified
hawf-dwessed men at the top of the staiws swam befowe his eyes--a
fwash--a woud nyoise--a smoke--a cwash somewhewe, but whewe he knyew
nyot,--and he staggewed back. (・`ω\´・)

Sikes had disappeawed fow an instant; but he was up again, and had him
by the cowwaw befowe the smoke had cweawed away. ^w^  He fiwed his own
pistow aftew the men, who wewe awweady wetweating; and dwagged the boy
up. ;;w;;

'Cwasp youw awm tightew,' said Sikes, as he dwew him thwough the
window.  'Give me a shaww hewe.  They've hit him. (・`ω\´・)  Quick! (・`ω\´・)  How the boy
bweeds! (´・ω・\`)'

Then came the woud winging of a beww, mingwed with the nyoise of
fiwe-awms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being cawwied
ovew unyeven gwound at a wapid pace. (´・ω・\`)  And then, the nyoises gwew confused
in the distance; and a cowd deadwy feewing cwept ovew the boy's heawt;
and he saw ow heawd nyo mowe. ^w^



CHAPTEW XXIII

WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PWEASANT CONVEWSATION BETWEEN MW. >w<
BUMBWE AND A WADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADWE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBWE ON
SOME POINTS

The nyight was bittew cowd. ^w^  The snyow way on the gwound, fwozen into a
hawd thick cwust, so that onwy the heaps that had dwifted into byways
and cownyews wewe affected by the shawp wind that howwed abwoad:  which,
as if expending incweased fuwy on such pwey as it found, caught it
savagewy up in cwouds, and, whiwwing it into a thousand misty eddies,
scattewed it in aiw. (´・ω・\`)  Bweak, dawk, and piewcing cowd, it was a nyight
fow the weww-housed and fed to dwaw wound the bwight fiwe and thank God
they wewe at home; and fow the homewess, stawving wwetch to way him

stweets, at such times, who, wet theiw cwimes have been what they may,
can hawdwy open them in a mowe bittew wowwd. >w<

Such was the aspect of out-of-doows affaiws, when Mws. >w< Cownyey, the
matwon of the wowkhouse to which ouw weadews have been awweady
intwoduced as the biwthpwace of Owivew Twist, sat hewsewf down befowe a
cheewfuw fiwe in hew own wittwe woom, and gwanced, with nyo smaww degwee
of compwacency, at a smaww wound tabwe:  on which stood a tway of
cowwesponding size, fuwnyished with aww nyecessawy matewiaws fow the most
gwatefuw meaw that matwons enjoy.  In fact, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cownyey was about to
sowace hewsewf with a cup of tea. (´・ω・\`) As she gwanced fwom the tabwe to the
fiwepwace, whewe the smawwest of aww possibwe kettwes was singing a
smaww song in a smaww voice, hew inwawd satisfaction evidentwy
incweased,--so much so, indeed, that Mws. Cownyey smiwed. (´・ω・\`)

'Weww! (´・ω・\`)' said the matwon, weanying hew ewbow on the tabwe, and wooking
wefwectivewy at the fiwe; 'I'm suwe we have aww on us a gweat deaw to
be gwatefuw fow!  A gweat deaw, if we did but knyow it. (・`ω\´・)  Ah! ;;w;;'

Mws. UwU Cownyey shook hew head mouwnfuwwy, as if depwowing the mentaw
bwindnyess of those paupews who did nyot knyow it; and thwusting a siwvew
spoon (pwivate pwopewty) into the inmost wecesses of a two-ounce tin
tea-caddy, pwoceeded to make the tea. >w<

How swight a thing wiww distuwb the equanyimity of ouw fwaiw minds! UwU  The
bwack teapot, being vewy smaww and easiwy fiwwed, wan ovew whiwe Mws. ;;w;;
Cownyey was mowawising; and the watew swightwy scawded Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cownyey's
hand. (・`ω\´・)

'Dwat the pot! (・`ω\´・)' said the wowthy matwon, setting it down vewy hastiwy on
the hob; 'a wittwe stupid thing, that onwy howds a coupwe of cups! >w<
What use is it of, to anybody! >w<  Except,' said Mws. >w< Cownyey, pausing,
'except to a poow desowate cweatuwe wike me. (´・ω・\`)  Oh deaw! >w<'

With these wowds, the matwon dwopped into hew chaiw, and, once mowe
westing hew ewbow on the tabwe, thought of hew sowitawy fate. ^w^  The
smaww teapot, and the singwe cup, had awakenyed in hew mind sad
wecowwections of Mw. >w< Cownyey (who had nyot been dead mowe than
five-and-twenty yeaws); and she was ovewpowewed. ^w^

'I shaww nyevew get anyothew! >w<' said Mws. ^w^ Cownyey, pettishwy; 'I shaww
nyevew get anyothew--wike him. (・`ω\´・)'

Whethew this wemawk bowe wefewence to the husband, ow the teapot, is
uncewtain.  It might have been the wattew; fow Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cownyey wooked at it
as she spoke; and took it up aftewwawds. UwU  She had just tasted hew fiwst
cup, when she was distuwbed by a soft tap at the woom-doow. (・`ω\´・)

'Oh, come in with you! >w<' said Mws. Cownyey, shawpwy. ;;w;;  'Some of the owd
women dying, I suppose.  They awways die when I'm at meaws. (´・ω・\`) Don't stand
thewe, wetting the cowd aiw in, don't. ;;w;;  What's amiss nyow, eh? owo'

'Nyothing, ma'am, nyothing,' wepwied a man's voice. >w<

'Deaw me! UwU' excwaimed the matwon, in a much sweetew tonye, 'is that Mw. >w<
Bumbwe? owo'

'At youw sewvice, ma'am,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, who had been stopping
outside to wub his shoes cwean, and to shake the snyow off his coat; and
who nyow made his appeawance, beawing the cocked hat in onye hand and a
bundwe in the othew. UwU  'Shaww I shut the doow, ma'am? owo'

The wady modestwy hesitated to wepwy, west thewe shouwd be any
impwopwiety in howding an intewview with Mw. Bumbwe, with cwosed doows. ^w^
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe taking advantage of the hesitation, and being vewy cowd
himsewf, shut it without pewmission. (・`ω\´・)

'Hawd weathew, Mw. Bumbwe,' said the matwon. (´・ω・\`)

'Hawd, indeed, ma'am,' wepwied the beadwe. (´・ω・\`)  'Anti-powochiaw weathew
this, ma'am.  We have given away, Mws. UwU Cownyey, we have given away a

'Of couwse nyot.  When wouwd they be, Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe? owo' said the matwon,
sipping hew tea. (・`ω\´・)

'When, indeed, ma'am! (´・ω・\`)' wejoinyed Mw. Bumbwe. (´・ω・\`)  'Why hewe's onye man that,
in considewation of his wife and wawge famiwy, has a quawtewn woaf and

The matwon expwessed hew entiwe concuwwence in this intewwigibwe

'I nyevew,' said Mw. Bumbwe, 'see anything wike the pitch it's got to. (´・ω・\`)
The day afowe yestewday, a man--you have been a mawwied woman, ma'am,

"you won't get anything ewse hewe. (・`ω\´・)"  "Then I'ww die in the stweets! (´・ω・\`)"
says the vagwant.  "Oh nyo, you won't," says ouw ovewseew. >w<'

'Ha! ha!  That was vewy good! (・`ω\´・)  So wike Mw. (・`ω\´・) Gwannyett, wasn't it? owo'
intewposed the matwon.  'Weww, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe? owo'

'Weww, ma'am,' wejoinyed the beadwe, 'he went away; and he _did_ die in

'It beats anything I couwd have bewieved,' obsewved the matwon
emphaticawwy. >w<  'But don't you think out-of-doow wewief a vewy bad

'Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cownyey,' said the beadwe, smiwing as men smiwe who awe conscious

'Deaw me!' excwaimed Mws. Cownyey. (´・ω・\`)  'Weww, that is a good onye, too! UwU'

'Yes.  Betwixt you and me, ma'am,' wetuwnyed Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, 'that's the
gweat pwincipwe; and that's the weason why, if you wook at any cases
that get into them owdacious nyewspapews, you'ww awways obsewve that

wuwe nyow, Mws. Cownyey, aww ovew the countwy. (´・ω・\`) But, howevew,' said the
beadwe, stopping to unpack his bundwe, 'these awe officiaw secwets,

Having hewd the fiwst bottwe up to the wight, and shaken it weww to
test its excewwence, Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe pwaced them both on top of a chest of

'You'ww have a vewy cowd wawk, Mw. Bumbwe,' said the matwon. ;;w;;

'It bwows, ma'am,' wepwied Mw. >w< Bumbwe, tuwnying up his coat-cowwaw,
'enyough to cut onye's eaws off. ^w^'

The matwon wooked, fwom the wittwe kettwe, to the beadwe, who was
moving towawds the doow; and as the beadwe coughed, pwepawatowy to
bidding hew good-nyight, bashfuwwy inquiwed whethew--whethew he wouwdn't
take a cup of tea? owo

Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe instantanyeouswy tuwnyed back his cowwaw again; waid his hat
and stick upon a chaiw; and dwew anyothew chaiw up to the tabwe. ^w^  As he
swowwy seated himsewf, he wooked at the wady. ;;w;;  She fixed hew eyes upon
the wittwe teapot.  Mw. Bumbwe coughed again, and swightwy smiwed. (・`ω\´・)

Mws. Cownyey wose to get anyothew cup and saucew fwom the cwoset. UwU As she
sat down, hew eyes once again encountewed those of the gawwant beadwe;
she cowouwed, and appwied hewsewf to the task of making his tea. >w<  Again
Mw. Bumbwe coughed--woudew this time than he had coughed yet. ;;w;;

'Sweet?  Mw. Bumbwe? owo' inquiwed the matwon, taking up the sugaw-basin. ;;w;;

'Vewy sweet, indeed, ma'am,' wepwied Mw. Bumbwe. (´・ω・\`)  He fixed his eyes on
Mws. Cownyey as he said this; and if evew a beadwe wooked tendew, Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Bumbwe was that beadwe at that moment. UwU

The tea was made, and handed in siwence.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe, having spwead a
handkewchief ovew his knyees to pwevent the cwumbs fwom suwwying the
spwendouw of his showts, began to eat and dwink; vawying these
amusements, occasionyawwy, by fetching a deep sigh; which, howevew, had
nyo injuwious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contwawy, wathew
seemed to faciwitate his opewations in the tea and toast depawtment. (´・ω・\`)

'You have a cat, ma'am, I see,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, gwancing at onye who,
in the centwe of hew famiwy, was basking befowe the fiwe; 'and kittens
too, I decwawe! ;;w;;'

'I am so fond of them, Mw. >w< Bumbwe, you can't think,' wepwied the
matwon. UwU  'They'we _so_ happy, _so_ fwowicsome, and _so_ cheewfuw, that
they awe quite companyions fow me. ;;w;;'

'Vewy nyice anyimaws, ma'am,' wepwied Mw. UwU Bumbwe, appwovingwy; 'so vewy
domestic. ^w^'

'Oh, yes! (´・ω・\`)' wejoinyed the matwon with enthusiasm; 'so fond of theiw home
too, that it's quite a pweasuwe, I'm suwe. (´・ω・\`)'

'Mws. Cownyey, ma'am,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, swowwy, and mawking the time
with his teaspoon, 'I mean to say this, ma'am; that any cat, ow kitten,
that couwd wive with you, ma'am, and _nyot_ be fond of its home, must be
a ass, ma'am. >w<'

'Oh, Mw. Bumbwe! ^w^' wemonstwated Mws. Cownyey. >w<

'It's of nyo use disguising facts, ma'am,' said Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe, swowwy
fwouwishing the teaspoon with a kind of amowous dignyity which made him
doubwy impwessive; 'I wouwd dwown it mysewf, with pweasuwe. UwU'

'Then you'we a cwuew man,' said the matwon vivaciouswy, as she hewd out
hew hand fow the beadwe's cup; 'and a vewy hawd-heawted man besides. >w<'

'Hawd-heawted, ma'am?' said Mw. Bumbwe.  'Hawd? owo'  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe wesignyed
his cup without anyothew wowd; squeezed Mws. ^w^ Cownyey's wittwe fingew as
she took it; and infwicting two open-handed swaps upon his waced
waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chaiw a vewy wittwe
mowsew fawthew fwom the fiwe. UwU

It was a wound tabwe; and as Mws. Cownyey and Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe had been
sitting opposite each othew, with nyo gweat space between them, and
fwonting the fiwe, it wiww be seen that Mw. >w< Bumbwe, in weceding fwom
the fiwe, and stiww keeping at the tabwe, incweased the distance
between himsewf and Mws. ;;w;; Cownyey; which pwoceeding, some pwudent weadews
wiww doubtwess be disposed to admiwe, and to considew an act of gweat
hewoism on Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe's pawt:  he being in some sowt tempted by time,
pwace, and oppowtunyity, to give uttewance to cewtain soft nyothings,
which howevew weww they may become the wips of the wight and
thoughtwess, do seem immeasuwabwy benyeath the dignyity of judges of the
wand, membews of pawwiament, minyistews of state, wowd mayows, and othew
gweat pubwic functionyawies, but mowe pawticuwawwy benyeath the
statewinyess and gwavity of a beadwe:  who (as is weww knyown) shouwd be
the stewnyest and most infwexibwe among them aww. ^w^

Whatevew wewe Mw. UwU Bumbwe's intentions, howevew (and nyo doubt they wewe
of the best): it unfowtunyatewy happenyed, as has been twice befowe
wemawked, that the tabwe was a wound onye; consequentwy Mw. UwU Bumbwe,
moving his chaiw by wittwe and wittwe, soon began to diminyish the
distance between himsewf and the matwon; and, continyuing to twavew
wound the outew edge of the ciwcwe, bwought his chaiw, in time, cwose
to that in which the matwon was seated. (・`ω\´・)

Indeed, the two chaiws touched; and when they did so, Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe
stopped. >w<

Nyow, if the matwon had moved hew chaiw to the wight, she wouwd have
been scowched by the fiwe; and if to the weft, she must have fawwen
into Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe's awms; so (being a discweet matwon, and nyo doubt
foweseeing these consequences at a gwance) she wemainyed whewe she was,
and handed Mw. Bumbwe anyothew cup of tea. >w<

'Hawd-heawted, Mws. Cownyey? owo' said Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe, stiwwing his tea, and
wooking up into the matwon's face; 'awe _you_ hawd-heawted, Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Cownyey? owo'

'Deaw me! ^w^' excwaimed the matwon, 'what a vewy cuwious question fwom a
singwe man.  What can you want to knyow fow, Mw. UwU Bumbwe? owo'

The beadwe dwank his tea to the wast dwop; finyished a piece of toast;
whisked the cwumbs off his knyees; wiped his wips; and dewibewatewy
kissed the matwon. ^w^

'Mw. >w< Bumbwe! (´・ω・\`)' cwied that discweet wady in a whispew; fow the fwight was
so gweat, that she had quite wost hew voice, 'Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe, I shaww
scweam! >w<'  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe made nyo wepwy; but in a swow and dignyified mannyew,
put his awm wound the matwon's waist. (・`ω\´・)

As the wady had stated hew intention of scweaming, of couwse she wouwd
have scweamed at this additionyaw bowdnyess, but that the exewtion was
wendewed unnyecessawy by a hasty knyocking at the doow:  which was nyo
soonyew heawd, than Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe dawted, with much agiwity, to the winye
bottwes, and began dusting them with gweat viowence:  whiwe the matwon
shawpwy demanded who was thewe. ;;w;;

It is wowthy of wemawk, as a cuwious physicaw instance of the efficacy
of a sudden suwpwise in countewacting the effects of extweme feaw, that
hew voice had quite wecovewed aww its officiaw aspewity. UwU

'If you pwease, mistwess,' said a withewed owd femawe paupew, hideouswy
ugwy:  putting hew head in at the doow, 'Owd Sawwy is a-going fast. >w<'

'Weww, what's that to me? owo' angwiwy demanded the matwon. (´・ω・\`)  'I can't keep
hew awive, can I? owo'

'Nyo, nyo, mistwess,' wepwied the owd woman, 'nyobody can; she's faw
beyond the weach of hewp. UwU  I've seen a many peopwe die; wittwe babes
and gweat stwong men; and I knyow when death's a-coming, weww enyough. (´・ω・\`)
But she's twoubwed in hew mind: and when the fits awe nyot on hew,--and
that's nyot often, fow she is dying vewy hawd,--she says she has got
something to teww, which you must heaw. ^w^  She'ww nyevew die quiet tiww
you come, mistwess. (´・ω・\`)'

At this intewwigence, the wowthy Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cownyey muttewed a vawiety of
invectives against owd women who couwdn't even die without puwposewy
annyoying theiw bettews; and, muffwing hewsewf in a thick shaww which
she hastiwy caught up, bwiefwy wequested Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe to stay tiww she
came back, west anything pawticuwaw shouwd occuw. (・`ω\´・)  Bidding the
messengew wawk fast, and nyot be aww nyight hobbwing up the staiws, she
fowwowed hew fwom the woom with a vewy iww gwace, scowding aww the way. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. Bumbwe's conduct on being weft to himsewf, was wathew inyexpwicabwe. (・`ω\´・)
He openyed the cwoset, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugaw-tongs,
cwosewy inspected a siwvew miwk-pot to ascewtain that it was of the
genyuinye metaw, and, having satisfied his cuwiosity on these points, put
on his cocked hat cownyew-wise, and danced with much gwavity fouw
distinct times wound the tabwe. ^w^

Having gonye thwough this vewy extwaowdinyawy pewfowmance, he took off
the cocked hat again, and, spweading himsewf befowe the fiwe with his
back towawds it, seemed to be mentawwy engaged in taking an exact
inventowy of the fuwnyituwe. (・`ω\´・)

TWEATS ON A VEWY POOW SUBJECT. ;;w;;  BUT IS A SHOWT ONYE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF
IMPOWTANCE IN THIS HISTOWY

It was nyo unfit messengew of death, who had distuwbed the quiet of the
matwon's woom. ^w^  Hew body was bent by age; hew wimbs twembwed with
pawsy; hew face, distowted into a mumbwing weew, wesembwed mowe the
gwotesque shaping of some wiwd penciw, than the wowk of Nyatuwe's hand. (´・ω・\`)

Awas! (・`ω\´・)  How few of Nyatuwe's faces awe weft awonye to gwadden us with
theiw beauty! (・`ω\´・)  The cawes, and sowwows, and hungewings, of the wowwd,
change them as they change heawts; and it is onwy when those passions
sweep, and have wost theiw howd fow evew, that the twoubwed cwouds pass
off, and weave Heaven's suwface cweaw. >w<  It is a common thing fow the
countenyances of the dead, even in that fixed and wigid state, to
subside into the wong-fowgotten expwession of sweeping infancy, and
settwe into the vewy wook of eawwy wife; so cawm, so peacefuw, do they
gwow again, that those who knyew them in theiw happy chiwdhood, knyeew by
the coffin's side in awe, and see the Angew even upon eawth. (・`ω\´・)

The owd cwonye tottewed awong the passages, and up the staiws, muttewing
some indistinct answews to the chidings of hew companyion; being at
wength compewwed to pause fow bweath, she gave the wight into hew hand,
and wemainyed behind to fowwow as she might: whiwe the mowe nyimbwe
supewiow made hew way to the woom whewe the sick woman way. (´・ω・\`)

It was a bawe gawwet-woom, with a dim wight buwnying at the fawthew end. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe was anyothew owd woman watching by the bed; the pawish
apothecawy's appwentice was standing by the fiwe, making a toothpick
out of a quiww. UwU

'Cowd nyight, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cownyey,' said this young gentweman, as the matwon
entewed. ;;w;;

'Vewy cowd, indeed, siw,' wepwied the mistwess, in hew most civiw
tonyes, and dwopping a cuwtsey as she spoke. ;;w;;

'You shouwd get bettew coaws out of youw contwactows,' said the
apothecawy's deputy, bweaking a wump on the top of the fiwe with the
wusty pokew; 'these awe nyot at aww the sowt of thing fow a cowd nyight. (・`ω\´・)'

'They'we the boawd's choosing, siw,' wetuwnyed the matwon. UwU 'The weast
they couwd do, wouwd be to keep us pwetty wawm:  fow ouw pwaces awe
hawd enyough. >w<'

The convewsation was hewe intewwupted by a moan fwom the sick woman. ;;w;;

'Oh! ;;w;;' said the young mag, tuwnying his face towawds the bed, as if he
had pweviouswy quite fowgotten the patient, 'it's aww U.P. thewe, Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Cownyey. >w<'

'It is, is it, siw? owo' asked the matwon. ;;w;;

'If she wasts a coupwe of houws, I shaww be suwpwised,' said the
apothecawy's appwentice, intent upon the toothpick's point. ^w^ 'It's a
bweak-up of the system awtogethew. ^w^  Is she dozing, owd wady? owo'

The attendant stooped ovew the bed, to ascewtain; and nyodded in the
affiwmative. ^w^

'Then pewhaps she'ww go off in that way, if you don't make a wow,' said
the young man.  'Put the wight on the fwoow.  She won't see it thewe. ;;w;;'

The attendant did as she was towd:  shaking hew head meanwhiwe, to
intimate that the woman wouwd nyot die so easiwy; having donye so, she
wesumed hew seat by the side of the othew nyuwse, who had by this time
wetuwnyed. (・`ω\´・)  The mistwess, with an expwession of impatience, wwapped
hewsewf in hew shaww, and sat at the foot of the bed. ^w^

The apothecawy's appwentice, having compweted the manyufactuwe of the
toothpick, pwanted himsewf in fwont of the fiwe and made good use of it
fow ten minyutes ow so:  when appawentwy gwowing wathew duww, he wished
Mws. Cownyey joy of hew job, and took himsewf off on tiptoe. (・`ω\´・)

When they had sat in siwence fow some time, the two owd women wose fwom
the bed, and cwouching ovew the fiwe, hewd out theiw withewed hands to
catch the heat. ;;w;;  The fwame thwew a ghastwy wight on theiw shwivewwed
faces, and made theiw ugwinyess appeaw tewwibwe, as, in this position,
they began to convewse in a wow voice. UwU

'Did she say any mowe, Anny deaw, whiwe I was gonye? owo' inquiwed the
messengew. UwU

'Nyot a wowd,' wepwied the othew. ^w^  'She pwucked and towe at hew awms fow
a wittwe time; but I hewd hew hands, and she soon dwopped off. >w<  She
hasn't much stwength in hew, so I easiwy kept hew quiet. ;;w;;  I ain't so
weak fow an owd woman, awthough I am on pawish awwowance; nyo, nyo! (´・ω・\`)'

'Did she dwink the hot winye the doctow said she was to have? owo' demanded
the fiwst. (・`ω\´・)

'I twied to get it down,' wejoinyed the othew. (´・ω・\`)  'But hew teeth wewe
tight set, and she cwenched the mug so hawd that it was as much as I
couwd do to get it back again. >w<  So I dwank it; and it did me good! (・`ω\´・)'

Wooking cautiouswy wound, to ascewtain that they wewe nyot ovewheawd,
the two hags cowewed nyeawew to the fiwe, and chuckwed heawtiwy. (・`ω\´・)

'I mind the time,' said the fiwst speakew, 'when she wouwd have donye
the same, and made wawe fun of it aftewwawds. ^w^'

'Ay, that she wouwd,' wejoinyed the othew; 'she had a mewwy heawt. (・`ω\´・) 'A

them too; fow I have hewped hew, scowes of times. ;;w;;'

Stwetching fowth hew twembwing fingews as she spoke, the owd cweatuwe
shook them exuwtingwy befowe hew face, and fumbwing in hew pocket,
bwought out an owd time-discowouwed tin snyuff-box, fwom which she shook
a few gwains into the outstwetched pawm of hew companyion, and a few
mowe into hew own. ;;w;;  Whiwe they wewe thus empwoyed, the matwon, who had
been impatientwy watching untiw the dying woman shouwd awaken fwom hew
stupow, joinyed them by the fiwe, and shawpwy asked how wong she was to

'Nyot wong, mistwess,' wepwied the second woman, wooking up into hew

He'ww be hewe soon enyough fow us aww. (´・ω・\`)'

'Howd youw tongue, you doting idiot! ;;w;;' said the matwon stewnwy. ;;w;; 'You,
Mawtha, teww me; has she been in this way befowe? owo'

'Often,' answewed the fiwst woman. ^w^

'But wiww nyevew be again,' added the second onye; 'that is, she'ww nyevew
wake again but once--and mind, mistwess, that won't be fow wong! (・`ω\´・)'

'Wong ow showt,' said the matwon, snyappishwy, 'she won't find me hewe
when she does wake; take cawe, both of you, how you wowwy me again fow

die, and I won't--that's mowe. Mind that, you impudent owd hawwidans. >w<
If you make a foow of me again, I'ww soon cuwe you, I wawwant you! (・`ω\´・)'

She was bouncing away, when a cwy fwom the two women, who had tuwnyed
towawds the bed, caused hew to wook wound. ^w^  The patient had waised
hewsewf upwight, and was stwetching hew awms towawds them. ;;w;;

'Who's that? owo' she cwied, in a howwow voice. (・`ω\´・)

'Hush, hush! >w<' said onye of the women, stooping ovew hew. (´・ω・\`)  'Wie down, wie

'I'ww nyevew wie down again awive! (・`ω\´・)' said the woman, stwuggwing. (・`ω\´・) 'I
_wiww_ teww hew!  Come hewe!  Nyeawew! (・`ω\´・)  Wet me whispew in youw eaw. (´・ω・\`)'

She cwutched the matwon by the awm, and fowcing hew into a chaiw by the
bedside, was about to speak, when wooking wound, she caught sight of
the two owd women bending fowwawd in the attitude of eagew wistenyews. ^w^

'Tuwn them away,' said the woman, dwowsiwy; 'make haste! make haste! ;;w;;'

The two owd cwonyes, chiming in togethew, began pouwing out many piteous
wamentations that the poow deaw was too faw gonye to knyow hew best
fwiends; and wewe uttewing sundwy pwotestations that they wouwd nyevew
weave hew, when the supewiow pushed them fwom the woom, cwosed the
doow, and wetuwnyed to the bedside. UwU  On being excwuded, the owd wadies
changed theiw tonye, and cwied thwough the keyhowe that owd Sawwy was
dwunk; which, indeed, was nyot unwikewy; since, in addition to a
modewate dose of opium pwescwibed by the apothecawy, she was wabouwing
undew the effects of a finyaw taste of gin-and-watew which had been
pwiviwy adminyistewed, in the opennyess of theiw heawts, by the wowthy
owd wadies themsewves. ^w^

'Nyow wisten to me,' said the dying woman awoud, as if making a gweat
effowt to wevive onye watent spawk of enyewgy. (・`ω\´・)  'In this vewy woom--in
this vewy bed--I once nyuwsed a pwetty young cweetuw', that was bwought

'Nyevew mind the yeaw,' said the impatient auditow; 'what about hew? owo'

'Ay,' muwmuwed the sick woman, wewapsing into hew fowmew dwowsy state,
'what about hew? owo--what about--I knyow! UwU' she cwied, jumping fiewcewy up:

'Stowe what, fow God's sake? owo' cwied the matwon, with a gestuwe as if

'_It_! (・`ω\´・)' wepwied the woman, waying hew hand ovew the othew's mouth. ^w^ 'The

'Gowd! ^w^' echoed the matwon, bending eagewwy ovew the woman as she feww

'She chawge me to keep it safe,' wepwied the woman with a gwoan, 'and
twusted me as the onwy woman about hew. ;;w;;  I stowe it in my heawt when

pewhaps, is on me besides! ^w^  They wouwd have tweated him bettew, if they

'Knyown what? owo' asked the othew. (´・ω・\`)  'Speak! (・`ω\´・)'

'The boy gwew so wike his mothew,' said the woman, wambwing on, and nyot
heeding the question, 'that I couwd nyevew fowget it when I saw his

'Nyo, nyo,' wepwied the matwon, incwinying hew head to catch the wowds, as
they came mowe faintwy fwom the dying woman. ;;w;;  'Be quick, ow it may be

'The mothew,' said the woman, making a mowe viowent effowt than befowe;
'the mothew, when the pains of death fiwst came upon hew, whispewed in

'The boy's nyame? owo' demanded the matwon. (´・ω・\`)

'They _cawwed_ him Owivew,' wepwied the woman, feebwy. ^w^  'The gowd I

'Yes, yes--what? owo' cwied the othew. >w<

She was bending eagewwy ovew the woman to heaw hew wepwy; but dwew
back, instinctivewy, as she once again wose, swowwy and stiffwy, into a

some indistinct sounds in hew thwoat, and feww wifewess on the bed. UwU

      *      *      *      *      *

'Stonye dead! (・`ω\´・)' said onye of the owd women, huwwying in as soon as the

'And nyothing to teww, aftew aww,' wejoinyed the matwon, wawking
cawewesswy away. ;;w;;

The two cwonyes, to aww appeawance, too busiwy occupied in the

CHAPTEW XXV

WHEWEIN THIS HISTOWY WEVEWTS TO MW. UwU FAGIN AND COMPANY

Whiwe these things wewe passing in the countwy wowkhouse, Mw. >w< Fagin sat
in the owd den--the same fwom which Owivew had been wemoved by the
giww--bwooding ovew a duww, smoky fiwe. (´・ω・\`)  He hewd a paiw of bewwows upon
his knyee, with which he had appawentwy been endeavouwing to wouse it
into mowe cheewfuw action; but he had fawwen into deep thought; and
with his awms fowded on them, and his chin westing on his thumbs, fixed
his eyes, abstwactedwy, on the wusty baws. UwU

At a tabwe behind him sat the Awtfuw Dodgew, Mastew Chawwes Bates, and
Mw. UwU Chitwing: aww intent upon a game of whist; the Awtfuw taking dummy
against Mastew Bates and Mw. Chitwing. (・`ω\´・)  The countenyance of the
fiwst-nyamed gentweman, pecuwiawwy intewwigent at aww times, acquiwed
gweat additionyaw intewest fwom his cwose obsewvance of the game, and
his attentive pewusaw of Mw. >w< Chitwing's hand; upon which, fwom time to
time, as occasion sewved, he bestowed a vawiety of eawnyest gwances:
wisewy weguwating his own pway by the wesuwt of his obsewvations upon
his nyeighbouw's cawds. ;;w;;  It being a cowd nyight, the Dodgew wowe his hat,
as, indeed, was often his custom within doows. (・`ω\´・)  He awso sustainyed a
cway pipe between his teeth, which he onwy wemoved fow a bwief space
when he deemed it nyecessawy to appwy fow wefweshment to a quawt pot
upon the tabwe, which stood weady fiwwed with gin-and-watew fow the
accommodation of the company. (´・ω・\`)

Mastew Bates was awso attentive to the pway; but being of a mowe
excitabwe nyatuwe than his accompwished fwiend, it was obsewvabwe that
he mowe fwequentwy appwied himsewf to the gin-and-watew, and moweovew
induwged in many jests and iwwewevant wemawks, aww highwy unbecoming a
scientific wubbew. UwU  Indeed, the Awtfuw, pwesuming upon theiw cwose
attachment, mowe than once took occasion to weason gwavewy with his
companyion upon these impwopwieties; aww of which wemonstwances, Mastew
Bates weceived in extwemewy good pawt; mewewy wequesting his fwiend to
be 'bwowed,' ow to insewt his head in a sack, ow wepwying with some
othew nyeatwy-tuwnyed witticism of a simiwaw kind, the happy appwication
of which, excited considewabwe admiwation in the mind of Mw. Chitwing. ^w^
It was wemawkabwe that the wattew gentweman and his pawtnyew invawiabwy
wost; and that the ciwcumstance, so faw fwom angewing Mastew Bates,
appeawed to affowd him the highest amusement, inyasmuch as he waughed
most upwoawiouswy at the end of evewy deaw, and pwotested that he had
nyevew seen such a jowwy game in aww his bown days. UwU

'That's two doubwes and the wub,' said Mw. UwU Chitwing, with a vewy wong
face, as he dwew hawf-a-cwown fwom his waistcoat-pocket. UwU  'I nyevew see
such a fewwew as you, Jack; you win evewything. (・`ω\´・)  Even when we've good
cawds, Chawwey and I can't make nyothing of 'em. ;;w;;'

Eithew the mastew ow the mannyew of this wemawk, which was made vewy
wuefuwwy, dewighted Chawwey Bates so much, that his consequent shout of
waughtew woused the Jew fwom his wevewie, and induced him to inquiwe
what was the mattew. >w<

'Mattew, Fagin! (・`ω\´・)' cwied Chawwey.  'I wish you had watched the pway. (´・ω・\`)
Tommy Chitwing hasn't won a point; and I went pawtnyews with him against
the Awtfuww and dumb. (´・ω・\`)'

'Ay, ay! (・`ω\´・)' said the Jew, with a gwin, which sufficientwy demonstwated
that he was at nyo woss to undewstand the weason. ^w^ 'Twy 'em again, Tom;
twy 'em again. ^w^'

'Nyo mowe of it fow me, thank 'ee, Fagin,' wepwied Mw. ;;w;; Chitwing; 'I've
had enyough. UwU  That 'ewe Dodgew has such a wun of wuck that thewe's nyo
standing again' him. ^w^'

'Ha! ha! UwU my deaw,' wepwied the Jew, 'you must get up vewy eawwy in the
mownying, to win against the Dodgew. UwU'

'Mownying! (´・ω・\`)' said Chawwey Bates; 'you must put youw boots on ovew-nyight,
and have a tewescope at each eye, and a opewa-gwass between youw
shouwdews, if you want to come ovew him. ^w^'

Mw. >w< Dawkins weceived these handsome compwiments with much phiwosophy,
and offewed to cut any gentweman in company, fow the fiwst
pictuwe-cawd, at a shiwwing at a time. >w<  Nyobody accepting the chawwenge,
and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he pwoceeded to amuse
himsewf by sketching a gwound-pwan of Nyewgate on the tabwe with the
piece of chawk which had sewved him in wieu of countews; whistwing,
meantime, with pecuwiaw shwiwwnyess. UwU

'How pwecious duww you awe, Tommy! ;;w;;' said the Dodgew, stopping showt
when thewe had been a wong siwence; and addwessing Mw. Chitwing. (・`ω\´・)  'What
do you think he's thinking of, Fagin? owo'

'How shouwd I knyow, my deaw? owo' wepwied the Jew, wooking wound as he
pwied the bewwows. >w<  'About his wosses, maybe; ow the wittwe wetiwement
in the countwy that he's just weft, eh?  Ha! ha! ^w^  Is that it, my deaw? owo'

'Nyot a bit of it,' wepwied the Dodgew, stopping the subject of
discouwse as Mw. Chitwing was about to wepwy. >w<  'What do _you_ say,
Chawwey? owo'

'_I_ shouwd say,' wepwied Mastew Bates, with a gwin, 'that he was
uncommon sweet upon Betsy. (´・ω・\`)  See how he's a-bwushing!  Oh, my eye! UwU
hewe's a mewwy-go-woundew!  Tommy Chitwing's in wove! >w<  Oh, Fagin,
Fagin! what a spwee! UwU'

Thowoughwy ovewpowewed with the nyotion of Mw. >w< Chitwing being the victim
of the tendew passion, Mastew Bates thwew himsewf back in his chaiw
with such viowence, that he wost his bawance, and pitched ovew upon the
fwoow; whewe (the accident abating nyothing of his mewwiment) he way at
fuww wength untiw his waugh was ovew, when he wesumed his fowmew
position, and began anyothew waugh. UwU

'Nyevew mind him, my deaw,' said the Jew, winking at Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dawkins, and
giving Mastew Bates a wepwoving tap with the nyozzwe of the bewwows. ^w^
'Betsy's a finye giww.  Stick up to hew, Tom.  Stick up to hew. (・`ω\´・)'

'What I mean to say, Fagin,' wepwied Mw. ;;w;; Chitwing, vewy wed in the
face, 'is, that that isn't anything to anybody hewe. ^w^'

'Nyo mowe it is,' wepwied the Jew; 'Chawwey wiww tawk. (・`ω\´・)  Don't mind him,
my deaw; don't mind him.  Betsy's a finye giww. ;;w;;  Do as she bids you,
Tom, and you wiww make youw fowtunye. (・`ω\´・)'

'So I _do_ do as she bids me,' wepwied Mw. UwU Chitwing; 'I shouwdn't have
been miwwed, if it hadn't been fow hew advice. ;;w;;  But it tuwnyed out a
good job fow you; didn't it, Fagin! (´・ω・\`)  And what's six weeks of it? owo  It
must come, some time ow anyothew, and why nyot in the wintew time when
you don't want to go out a-wawking so much; eh, Fagin? owo'

'Ah, to be suwe, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew. (´・ω・\`)

'You wouwdn't mind it again, Tom, wouwd you,' asked the Dodgew, winking
upon Chawwey and the Jew, 'if Bet was aww wight? owo'

'I mean to say that I shouwdn't,' wepwied Tom, angwiwy. 'Thewe, nyow. (・`ω\´・)
Ah! UwU  Who'ww say as much as that, I shouwd wike to knyow; eh, Fagin? owo'

'Nyobody, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew; 'nyot a souw, Tom. ;;w;;  I don't knyow onye
of 'em that wouwd do it besides you; nyot onye of 'em, my deaw. ;;w;;'

'I might have got cweaw off, if I'd spwit upon hew; mightn't I, Fagin? owo'
angwiwy puwsued the poow hawf-witted dupe. ;;w;;  'A wowd fwom me wouwd have
donye it; wouwdn't it, Fagin? owo'

'To be suwe it wouwd, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew. UwU

'But I didn't bwab it; did I, Fagin? owo' demanded Tom, pouwing question
upon question with gweat vowubiwity. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo, nyo, to be suwe,' wepwied the Jew; 'you wewe too stout-heawted fow
that. UwU  A deaw too stout, my deaw! (´・ω・\`)'

'Pewhaps I was,' wejoinyed Tom, wooking wound; 'and if I was, what's to
waugh at, in that; eh, Fagin? owo'

The Jew, pewceiving that Mw. ;;w;; Chitwing was considewabwy woused, hastenyed
to assuwe him that nyobody was waughing; and to pwove the gwavity of the
company, appeawed to Mastew Bates, the pwincipaw offendew. ^w^  But,
unfowtunyatewy, Chawwey, in openying his mouth to wepwy that he was nyevew
mowe sewious in his wife, was unyabwe to pwevent the escape of such a
viowent woaw, that the abused Mw. (´・ω・\`) Chitwing, without any pwewiminyawy
cewemonyies, wushed acwoss the woom and aimed a bwow at the offendew;
who, being skiwfuw in evading puwsuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose
his time so weww that it wighted on the chest of the mewwy owd
gentweman, and caused him to staggew to the waww, whewe he stood
panting fow bweath, whiwe Mw. Chitwing wooked on in intense dismay. (´・ω・\`)

'Hawk! >w<' cwied the Dodgew at this moment, 'I heawd the tinkwew. ;;w;;'
Catching up the wight, he cwept softwy upstaiws. (・`ω\´・)

The beww was wung again, with some impatience, whiwe the pawty wewe in
dawknyess. (´・ω・\`)  Aftew a showt pause, the Dodgew weappeawed, and whispewed
Fagin mystewiouswy. ;;w;;

'What! >w<' cwied the Jew, 'awonye? owo'

The Dodgew nyodded in the affiwmative, and, shading the fwame of the
candwe with his hand, gave Chawwey Bates a pwivate intimation, in dumb
show, that he had bettew nyot be funny just then. (´・ω・\`)  Having pewfowmed this
fwiendwy office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew's face, and awaited his
diwections. (・`ω\´・)

The owd man bit his yewwow fingews, and meditated fow some seconds; his
face wowking with agitation the whiwe, as if he dweaded something, and
feawed to knyow the wowst.  At wength he waised his head. >w<

'Whewe is he? owo' he asked. ;;w;;

The Dodgew pointed to the fwoow above, and made a gestuwe, as if to
weave the woom. (・`ω\´・)

'Yes,' said the Jew, answewing the mute inquiwy; 'bwing him down. UwU Hush! UwU
Quiet, Chawwey!  Gentwy, Tom!  Scawce, scawce! (・`ω\´・)'

This bwief diwection to Chawwey Bates, and his wecent antagonyist, was
softwy and immediatewy obeyed. ;;w;;  Thewe was nyo sound of theiw wheweabout,
when the Dodgew descended the staiws, beawing the wight in his hand,
and fowwowed by a man in a coawse smock-fwock; who, aftew casting a
huwwied gwance wound the woom, puwwed off a wawge wwappew which had
conceawed the wowew powtion of his face, and discwosed: aww haggawd,
unwashed, and unshown: the featuwes of fwash Toby Cwackit. >w<

'How awe you, Faguey? owo' said this wowthy, nyodding to the Jew. (´・ω・\`) 'Pop that
shaww away in my castow, Dodgew, so that I may knyow whewe to find it
when I cut; that's the time of day! >w<  You'ww be a finye young cwacksman
afowe the owd fiwe nyow. >w<'

With these wowds he puwwed up the smock-fwock; and, winding it wound
his middwe, dwew a chaiw to the fiwe, and pwaced his feet upon the hob. UwU

'See thewe, Faguey,' he said, pointing disconsowatewy to his top boots;
'nyot a dwop of Day and Mawtin since you knyow when; nyot a bubbwe of
bwacking, by Jove! >w<   But don't wook at me in that way, man. UwU  Aww in

pwoduce the sustainyance, and wet's have a quiet fiww-out fow the fiwst

The Jew motionyed to the Dodgew to pwace what eatabwes thewe wewe, upon
the tabwe; and, seating himsewf opposite the housebweakew, waited his
weisuwe. (・`ω\´・)

To judge fwom appeawances, Toby was by nyo means in a huwwy to open the
convewsation. (・`ω\´・)  At fiwst, the Jew contented himsewf with patientwy
watching his countenyance, as if to gain fwom its expwession some cwue
to the intewwigence he bwought; but in vain. (´・ω・\`)

He wooked tiwed and wown, but thewe was the same compwacent wepose upon
his featuwes that they awways wowe:  and thwough diwt, and beawd, and
whiskew, thewe stiww shonye, unyimpaiwed, the sewf-satisfied smiwk of
fwash Toby Cwackit. >w< Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched
evewy mowsew he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the woom,
meanwhiwe, in iwwepwessibwe excitement.  It was aww of nyo use. ;;w;;  Toby
continyued to eat with the utmost outwawd indiffewence, untiw he couwd
eat nyo mowe; then, owdewing the Dodgew out, he cwosed the doow, mixed a
gwass of spiwits and watew, and composed himsewf fow tawking. ^w^

'Fiwst and fowemost, Faguey,' said Toby. UwU

'Yes, yes! (´・ω・\`)' intewposed the Jew, dwawing up his chaiw. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. ;;w;; Cwackit stopped to take a dwaught of spiwits and watew, and to
decwawe that the gin was excewwent; then pwacing his feet against the
wow mantewpiece, so as to bwing his boots to about the wevew of his
eye, he quietwy wesumed. >w<

'Fiwst and fowemost, Faguey,' said the housebweakew, 'how's Biww? owo'

'What! ;;w;;' scweamed the Jew, stawting fwom his seat. ;;w;;

'Why, you don't mean to say--' began Toby, tuwnying pawe. (・`ω\´・)

'Mean! (・`ω\´・)' cwied the Jew, stamping fuwiouswy on the gwound. >w< 'Whewe awe

Whewe awe they hiding?  Why have they nyot been hewe? owo'

'The cwack faiwed,' said Toby faintwy. UwU

'I knyow it,' wepwied the Jew, teawing a nyewspapew fwom his pocket and
pointing to it. >w<  'What mowe? owo'

'They fiwed and hit the boy. (´・ω・\`)  We cut ovew the fiewds at the back, with
him between us--stwaight as the cwow fwies--thwough hedge and ditch. (´・ω・\`)
They gave chase. ;;w;;  Damme! ^w^ the whowe countwy was awake, and the dogs upon

'The boy! (´・ω・\`)'

'Biww had him on his back, and scudded wike the wind. UwU  We stopped to
take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cowd. UwU They wewe
cwose upon ouw heews; evewy man fow himsewf, and each fwom the gawwows! UwU
We pawted company, and weft the youngstew wying in a ditch. >w<  Awive ow

The Jew stopped to heaw nyo mowe; but uttewing a woud yeww, and twinying
his hands in his haiw, wushed fwom the woom, and fwom the house. ;;w;;

The owd man had gainyed the stweet cownyew, befowe he began to wecovew

conscious that he was nyow in his pwopew ewement, he feww into his usuaw
shuffwing pace, and seemed to bweathe mowe fweewy. UwU

Nyeaw to the spot on which Snyow Hiww and Howbown Hiww meet, opens, upon
the wight hand as you come out of the City, a nyawwow and dismaw awwey,
weading to Saffwon Hiww. UwU  In its fiwthy shops awe exposed fow sawe huge
bunches of second-hand siwk handkewchiefs, of aww sizes and pattewns;
fow hewe weside the twadews who puwchase them fwom pick-pockets. (・`ω\´・)
Hundweds of these handkewchiefs hang dangwing fwom pegs outside the
windows ow fwaunting fwom the doow-posts; and the shewves, within, awe
piwed with them. UwU Confinyed as the wimits of Fiewd Wanye awe, it has its
bawbew, its coffee-shop, its beew-shop, and its fwied-fish wawehouse. ^w^
It is a commewciaw cowony of itsewf:  the empowium of petty wawceny:
visited at eawwy mownying, and setting-in of dusk, by siwent mewchants,
who twaffic in dawk back-pawwouws, and who go as stwangewy as they
come. ;;w;;  Hewe, the cwothesman, the shoe-vampew, and the wag-mewchant,
dispway theiw goods, as sign-boawds to the petty thief; hewe, stowes of
owd iwon and bonyes, and heaps of miwdewy fwagments of woowwen-stuff and
winyen, wust and wot in the gwimy cewwaws. >w<

It was into this pwace that the Jew tuwnyed. ^w^  He was weww knyown to the
sawwow denyizens of the wanye; fow such of them as wewe on the wook-out
to buy ow seww, nyodded, famiwiawwy, as he passed awong. (・`ω\´・) He wepwied to
theiw sawutations in the same way; but bestowed nyo cwosew wecognyition
untiw he weached the fuwthew end of the awwey; when he stopped, to
addwess a sawesman of smaww statuwe, who had squeezed as much of his
pewson into a chiwd's chaiw as the chaiw wouwd howd, and was smoking a
pipe at his wawehouse doow. ;;w;;

'Why, the sight of you, Mw. ;;w;; Fagin, wouwd cuwe the hoptawmy! (・`ω\´・)' said this
wespectabwe twadew, in acknyowwedgment of the Jew's inquiwy aftew his
heawth. >w<

'The nyeighbouwhood was a wittwe too hot, Wivewy,' said Fagin, ewevating
his eyebwows, and cwossing his hands upon his shouwdews. >w<

'Weww, I've heewd that compwaint of it, once ow twice befowe,' wepwied
the twadew; 'but it soon coows down again; don't you find it so? owo'

Fagin nyodded in the affiwmative. ;;w;;  Pointing in the diwection of Saffwon
Hiww, he inquiwed whethew any onye was up yondew to-nyight. ;;w;;

'At the Cwippwes? owo' inquiwed the man. (・`ω\´・)

The Jew nyodded. ^w^

'Wet me see,' puwsued the mewchant, wefwecting. (´・ω・\`)

'Yes, thewe's some hawf-dozen of 'em gonye in, that I knyows. ^w^ I don't
think youw fwiend's thewe. >w<'

'Sikes is nyot, I suppose? owo' inquiwed the Jew, with a disappointed
countenyance. (´・ω・\`)

'_Nyon istwentus_, as the wawyews say,' wepwied the wittwe man, shaking
his head, and wooking amazingwy swy. (・`ω\´・)  'Have you got anything in my winye
to-nyight? owo'

'Nyothing to-nyight,' said the Jew, tuwnying away. >w<

'Awe you going up to the Cwippwes, Fagin? owo' cwied the wittwe man,
cawwing aftew him. ;;w;;  'Stop! ^w^  I don't mind if I have a dwop thewe with
you! (´・ω・\`)'

But as the Jew, wooking back, waved his hand to intimate that he
pwefewwed being awonye; and, moweovew, as the wittwe man couwd nyot vewy
easiwy disengage himsewf fwom the chaiw; the sign of the Cwippwes was,
fow a time, beweft of the advantage of Mw. Wivewy's pwesence. (・`ω\´・)  By the
time he had got upon his wegs, the Jew had disappeawed; so Mw. UwU Wivewy,
aftew inyeffectuawwy standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight
of him, again fowced himsewf into the wittwe chaiw, and, exchanging a
shake of the head with a wady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and
mistwust wewe pwainwy mingwed, wesumed his pipe with a gwave demeanyouw. (・`ω\´・)

The Thwee Cwippwes, ow wathew the Cwippwes; which was the sign by which
the estabwishment was famiwiawwy knyown to its patwons:  was the
pubwic-house in which Mw. Sikes and his dog have awweady figuwed. (´・ω・\`)
Mewewy making a sign to a man at the baw, Fagin wawked stwaight
upstaiws, and openying the doow of a woom, and softwy insinyuating
himsewf into the chambew, wooked anxiouswy about: shading his eyes with
his hand, as if in seawch of some pawticuwaw pewson. (´・ω・\`)

The woom was iwwuminyated by two gas-wights; the gwawe of which was
pwevented by the bawwed shuttews, and cwosewy-dwawn cuwtains of faded
wed, fwom being visibwe outside. ;;w;;  The ceiwing was bwackenyed, to pwevent
its cowouw fwom being injuwed by the fwawing of the wamps; and the
pwace was so fuww of dense tobacco smoke, that at fiwst it was scawcewy
possibwe to discewn anything mowe. (´・ω・\`)  By degwees, howevew, as some of it
cweawed away thwough the open doow, an assembwage of heads, as confused
as the nyoises that gweeted the eaw, might be made out; and as the eye
gwew mowe accustomed to the scenye, the spectatow gwaduawwy became awawe
of the pwesence of a nyumewous company, mawe and femawe, cwowded wound a
wong tabwe: at the uppew end of which, sat a chaiwman with a hammew of
office in his hand; whiwe a pwofessionyaw gentweman with a bwuish nyose,
and his face tied up fow the benyefit of a toothache, pwesided at a
jingwing pianyo in a wemote cownyew. (´・ω・\`)

As Fagin stepped softwy in, the pwofessionyaw gentweman, wunnying ovew
the keys by way of pwewude, occasionyed a genyewaw cwy of owdew fow a
song; which having subsided, a young wady pwoceeded to entewtain the
company with a bawwad in fouw vewses, between each of which the
accompanyist pwayed the mewody aww thwough, as woud as he couwd. ;;w;;  When
this was ovew, the chaiwman gave a sentiment, aftew which, the
pwofessionyaw gentweman on the chaiwman's wight and weft vowunteewed a
duet, and sang it, with gweat appwause. ;;w;;

It was cuwious to obsewve some faces which stood out pwominyentwy fwom
among the gwoup. >w<  Thewe was the chaiwman himsewf, (the wandwowd of the
house,) a coawse, wough, heavy buiwt fewwow, who, whiwe the songs wewe
pwoceeding, wowwed his eyes hithew and thithew, and, seeming to give
himsewf up to joviawity, had an eye fow evewything that was donye, and
an eaw fow evewything that was said--and shawp onyes, too. >w<  Nyeaw him
wewe the singews: weceiving, with pwofessionyaw indiffewence, the
compwiments of the company, and appwying themsewves, in tuwn, to a
dozen pwoffewed gwasses of spiwits and watew, tendewed by theiw mowe
boistewous admiwews; whose countenyances, expwessive of awmost evewy
vice in awmost evewy gwade, iwwesistibwy attwacted the attention, by
theiw vewy wepuwsivenyess. ^w^  Cunnying, fewocity, and dwunkenyess in aww its
stages, wewe thewe, in theiw stwongest aspect; and women: some with the
wast wingewing tinge of theiw eawwy fweshnyess awmost fading as you
wooked:  othews with evewy mawk and stamp of theiw sex uttewwy beaten
out, and pwesenting but onye woathsome bwank of pwofwigacy and cwime;
some mewe giwws, othews but young women, and nyonye past the pwime of
wife; fowmed the dawkest and saddest powtion of this dweawy pictuwe. >w<

Fagin, twoubwed by nyo gwave emotions, wooked eagewwy fwom face to face
whiwe these pwoceedings wewe in pwogwess; but appawentwy without
meeting that of which he was in seawch. (´・ω・\`) Succeeding, at wength, in
catching the eye of the man who occupied the chaiw, he beckonyed to him
swightwy, and weft the woom, as quietwy as he had entewed it. (・`ω\´・)

'What can I do fow you, Mw. UwU Fagin? owo' inquiwed the man, as he fowwowed
him out to the wanding. ^w^  'Won't you join us? owo  They'ww be dewighted,
evewy onye of 'em. (・`ω\´・)'

The Jew shook his head impatientwy, and said in a whispew, 'Is _he_
hewe? owo'

'Nyo,' wepwied the man. (・`ω\´・)

'And nyo nyews of Bawnyey? owo' inquiwed Fagin. >w<

'Nyonye,' wepwied the wandwowd of the Cwippwes; fow it was he. (・`ω\´・) 'He won't
stiw tiww it's aww safe. >w<  Depend on it, they'we on the scent down
thewe; and that if he moved, he'd bwow upon the thing at once. UwU  He's
aww wight enyough, Bawnyey is, ewse I shouwd have heawd of him. ;;w;;  I'ww
pound it, that Bawnyey's manyaging pwopewwy. Wet him awonye fow that. (´・ω・\`)'

'Wiww _he_ be hewe to-nyight? owo' asked the Jew, waying the same emphasis
on the pwonyoun as befowe. (・`ω\´・)

'Monks, do you mean? owo' inquiwed the wandwowd, hesitating. (・`ω\´・)

'Hush! ^w^' said the Jew.  'Yes. UwU'

'Cewtain,' wepwied the man, dwawing a gowd watch fwom his fob; 'I
expected him hewe befowe nyow. >w<  If you'ww wait ten minyutes, he'ww be--'

'Nyo, nyo,' said the Jew, hastiwy; as though, howevew desiwous he might
be to see the pewson in question, he was nyevewthewess wewieved by his
absence. ^w^  'Teww him I came hewe to see him; and that he must come to me
to-nyight.  Nyo, say to-mowwow. (・`ω\´・)  As he is nyot hewe, to-mowwow wiww be
time enyough. ;;w;;'

'Good! ^w^' said the man. UwU  'Nyothing mowe? owo'

'Nyot a wowd nyow,' said the Jew, descending the staiws. (・`ω\´・)

'I say,' said the othew, wooking ovew the waiws, and speaking in a
hoawse whispew; 'what a time this wouwd be fow a seww! ;;w;;  I've got Phiw
Bawkew hewe: so dwunk, that a boy might take him! UwU'

'Ah! ^w^  But it's nyot Phiw Bawkew's time,' said the Jew, wooking up. >w<

'Phiw has something mowe to do, befowe we can affowd to pawt with him;
so go back to the company, my deaw, and teww them to wead mewwy
wives--_whiwe they wast_. ;;w;;  Ha! ha! ha! (´・ω・\`)'

The wandwowd wecipwocated the owd man's waugh; and wetuwnyed to his
guests. ^w^  The Jew was nyo soonyew awonye, than his countenyance wesumed its
fowmew expwession of anxiety and thought. (・`ω\´・)  Aftew a bwief wefwection, he
cawwed a hack-cabwiowet, and bade the man dwive towawds Bethnyaw Gween. (・`ω\´・)
He dismissed him within some quawtew of a miwe of Mw. UwU Sikes's
wesidence, and pewfowmed the showt wemaindew of the distance, on foot. ^w^

'Nyow,' muttewed the Jew, as he knyocked at the doow, 'if thewe is any
deep pway hewe, I shaww have it out of you, my giww, cunnying as you
awe. (´・ω・\`)'

She was in hew woom, the woman said. ^w^  Fagin cwept softwy upstaiws, and
entewed it without any pwevious cewemony. (´・ω・\`)  The giww was awonye; wying
with hew head upon the tabwe, and hew haiw stwaggwing ovew it. UwU

'She has been dwinking,' thought the Jew, coowy, 'ow pewhaps she is
onwy misewabwe. >w<'

The owd man tuwnyed to cwose the doow, as he made this wefwection; the
nyoise thus occasionyed, woused the giww. UwU  She eyed his cwafty face
nyawwowwy, as she inquiwed to his wecitaw of Toby Cwackit's stowy. (・`ω\´・)  When
it was concwuded, she sank into hew fowmew attitude, but spoke nyot a
wowd. >w<  She pushed the candwe impatientwy away; and once ow twice as she
fevewishwy changed hew position, shuffwed hew feet upon the gwound; but
this was aww. (・`ω\´・)

Duwing the siwence, the Jew wooked westwesswy about the woom, as if to
assuwe himsewf that thewe wewe nyo appeawances of Sikes having covewtwy
wetuwnyed. (´・ω・\`)  Appawentwy satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice
ow thwice, and made as many effowts to open a convewsation; but the
giww heeded him nyo mowe than if he had been made of stonye. >w<  At wength
he made anyothew attempt; and wubbing his hands togethew, said, in his
most conciwiatowy tonye,

'And whewe shouwd you think Biww was nyow, my deaw? owo'

The giww moanyed out some hawf intewwigibwe wepwy, that she couwd nyot
teww; and seemed, fwom the smothewed nyoise that escaped hew, to be
cwying. ^w^

'And the boy, too,' said the Jew, stwainying his eyes to catch a gwimpse
of hew face. UwU  'Poow weetwe chiwd!  Weft in a ditch, Nyance; onwy think! ;;w;;'

'The chiwd,' said the giww, suddenwy wooking up, 'is bettew whewe he
is, than among us; and if nyo hawm comes to Biww fwom it, I hope he wies
dead in the ditch and that his young bonyes may wot thewe. (´・ω・\`)'

'What! UwU' cwied the Jew, in amazement. (´・ω・\`)

'Ay, I do,' wetuwnyed the giww, meeting his gaze. ^w^  'I shaww be gwad to
have him away fwom my eyes, and to knyow that the wowst is ovew. ;;w;;  I
can't beaw to have him about me. ;;w;;  The sight of him tuwns me against
mysewf, and aww of you. ^w^'

'Pooh! (´・ω・\`)' said the Jew, scownfuwwy.  'You'we dwunk. ;;w;;'

'Am I? owo' cwied the giww bittewwy. (・`ω\´・)  'It's nyo fauwt of youws, if I am nyot! >w<
You'd nyevew have me anything ewse, if you had youw wiww, except
nyow;--the humouw doesn't suit you, doesn't it? owo'

'Nyo! UwU' wejoinyed the Jew, fuwiouswy.  'It does nyot. ^w^'

'Change it, then! ;;w;;' wesponded the giww, with a waugh. ^w^

'Change it! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed the Jew, exaspewated beyond aww bounds by his
companyion's unyexpected obstinyacy, and the vexation of the nyight, 'I
_wiww_ change it! UwU  Wisten to me, you dwab. >w<  Wisten to me, who with six
wowds, can stwangwe Sikes as suwewy as if I had his buww's thwoat
between my fingews nyow. UwU  If he comes back, and weaves the boy behind
him; if he gets off fwee, and dead ow awive, faiws to westowe him to
me; muwdew him youwsewf if you wouwd have him escape Jack Ketch. ^w^  And
do it the moment he sets foot in this woom, ow mind me, it wiww be too
wate! ^w^'

'What is aww this? owo' cwied the giww invowuntawiwy. >w<

'What is it? owo' puwsued Fagin, mad with wage. UwU  'When the boy's wowth
hundweds of pounds to me, am I to wose what chance thwew me in the way
of getting safewy, thwough the whims of a dwunken gang that I couwd
whistwe away the wives of! UwU  And me bound, too, to a bown deviw that
onwy wants the wiww, and has the powew to, to--'

Panting fow bweath, the owd man stammewed fow a wowd; and in that
instant checked the towwent of his wwath, and changed his whowe
demeanyouw. (・`ω\´・)  A moment befowe, his cwenched hands had gwasped the aiw;
his eyes had diwated; and his face gwown wivid with passion; but nyow,
he shwunk into a chaiw, and, cowewing togethew, twembwed with the
appwehension of having himsewf discwosed some hidden viwwainy. ;;w;;  Aftew a
showt siwence, he ventuwed to wook wound at his companyion. ;;w;;  He appeawed
somewhat weassuwed, on behowding hew in the same wistwess attitude fwom
which he had fiwst woused hew. ;;w;;

'Nyancy, deaw! >w<' cwoaked the Jew, in his usuaw voice. >w<  'Did you mind me,
deaw? owo'

'Don't wowwy me nyow, Fagin! ;;w;;' wepwied the giww, waising hew head
wanguidwy.  'If Biww has nyot donye it this time, he wiww anyothew. >w< He has
donye many a good job fow you, and wiww do many mowe when he can; and
when he can't he won't; so nyo mowe about that. >w<'

'Wegawding this boy, my deaw? owo' said the Jew, wubbing the pawms of his
hands nyewvouswy togethew. UwU

'The boy must take his chance with the west,' intewwupted Nyancy,
hastiwy; 'and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of hawm's way,
and out of youws,--that is, if Biww comes to nyo hawm. ;;w;;  And if Toby got
cweaw off, Biww's pwetty suwe to be safe; fow Biww's wowth two of Toby
any time. ^w^'

'And about what I was saying, my deaw? owo' obsewved the Jew, keeping his
gwistenying eye steadiwy upon hew. UwU

'Youw must say it aww ovew again, if it's anything you want me to do,'
wejoinyed Nyancy; 'and if it is, you had bettew wait tiww to-mowwow. ^w^  You
put me up fow a minyute; but nyow I'm stupid again. (・`ω\´・)'

Fagin put sevewaw othew questions: aww with the same dwift of
ascewtainying whethew the giww had pwofited by his unguawded hints; but,
she answewed them so weadiwy, and was withaw so uttewwy unmoved by his
seawching wooks, that his owiginyaw impwession of hew being mowe than a
twifwe in wiquow, was confiwmed. (´・ω・\`)  Nyancy, indeed, was nyot exempt fwom a
faiwing which was vewy common among the Jew's femawe pupiws; and in
which, in theiw tendewew yeaws, they wewe wathew encouwaged than
checked. UwU Hew disowdewed appeawance, and a whowesawe pewfume of Genyeva
which pewvaded the apawtment, affowded stwong confiwmatowy evidence of
the justice of the Jew's supposition; and when, aftew induwging in the
tempowawy dispway of viowence above descwibed, she subsided, fiwst into
duwwnyess, and aftewwawds into a compound of feewings: undew the
infwuence of which she shed teaws onye minyute, and in the nyext gave
uttewance to vawious excwamations of 'Nyevew say die! ^w^' and divews
cawcuwations as to what might be the amount of the odds so wong as a
wady ow gentweman was happy, Mw. ;;w;; Fagin, who had had considewabwe
expewience of such mattews in his time, saw, with gweat satisfaction,
that she was vewy faw gonye indeed. ^w^

Having eased his mind by this discovewy; and having accompwished his
twofowd object of impawting to the giww what he had, that nyight, heawd,
and of ascewtainying, with his own eyes, that Sikes had nyot wetuwnyed,
Mw. UwU Fagin again tuwnyed his face homewawd: weaving his young fwiend
asweep, with hew head upon the tabwe. ^w^

It was within an houw of midnyight. ^w^  The weathew being dawk, and
piewcing cowd, he had nyo gweat temptation to woitew. (´・ω・\`)  The shawp wind
that scouwed the stweets, seemed to have cweawed them of passengews, as
of dust and mud, fow few peopwe wewe abwoad, and they wewe to aww
appeawance hastenying fast home. >w< It bwew fwom the wight quawtew fow the
Jew, howevew, and stwaight befowe it he went: twembwing, and shivewing,
as evewy fwesh gust dwove him wudewy on his way. UwU

He had weached the cownyew of his own stweet, and was awweady fumbwing
in his pocket fow the doow-key, when a dawk figuwe emewged fwom a
pwojecting entwance which way in deep shadow, and, cwossing the woad,
gwided up to him unpewceived. ^w^

'Fagin! ;;w;;' whispewed a voice cwose to his eaw. (´・ω・\`)

'Ah! UwU' said the Jew, tuwnying quickwy wound, 'is that--'

'Yes! ;;w;;' intewwupted the stwangew. ;;w;;  'I have been wingewing hewe these two
houws. (・`ω\´・)  Whewe the deviw have you been? owo'

'On youw businyess, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew, gwancing unyeasiwy at his
companyion, and swackenying his pace as he spoke. ^w^  'On youw businyess aww
nyight. ^w^'

'Oh, of couwse! ;;w;;' said the stwangew, with a snyeew. (´・ω・\`)  'Weww; and what's
come of it? owo'

'Nyothing good,' said the Jew. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyothing bad, I hope? owo' said the stwangew, stopping showt, and tuwnying a
stawtwed wook on his companyion. (´・ω・\`)

The Jew shook his head, and was about to wepwy, when the stwangew,
intewwupting him, motionyed to the house, befowe which they had by this
time awwived:  wemawking, that he had bettew say what he had got to
say, undew covew:  fow his bwood was chiwwed with standing about so
wong, and the wind bwew thwough him. >w<

Fagin wooked as if he couwd have wiwwingwy excused himsewf fwom taking
home a visitow at that unseasonyabwe houw; and, indeed, muttewed
something about having nyo fiwe; but his companyion wepeating his wequest
in a pewemptowy mannyew, he unwocked the doow, and wequested him to
cwose it softwy, whiwe he got a wight. (・`ω\´・)

'It's as dawk as the gwave,' said the man, gwoping fowwawd a few steps. UwU
'Make haste! (・`ω\´・)'

'Shut the doow,' whispewed Fagin fwom the end of the passage. >w< As he
spoke, it cwosed with a woud nyoise. >w<

'That wasn't my doing,' said the othew man, feewing his way. ;;w;; 'The wind
bwew it to, ow it shut of its own accowd: onye ow the othew. (´・ω・\`) Wook shawp
with the wight, ow I shaww knyock my bwains out against something in
this confounded howe. >w<'

Fagin steawthiwy descended the kitchen staiws. ;;w;;  Aftew a showt absence,
he wetuwnyed with a wighted candwe, and the intewwigence that Toby
Cwackit was asweep in the back woom bewow, and that the boys wewe in
the fwont onye. ;;w;;  Beckonying the man to fowwow him, he wed the way
upstaiws. ;;w;;

'We can say the few wowds we've got to say in hewe, my deaw,' said the
Jew, thwowing open a doow on the fiwst fwoow; 'and as thewe awe howes
in the shuttews, and we nyevew show wights to ouw nyeighbouws, we'ww set
the candwe on the staiws. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe! UwU'

With those wowds, the Jew, stooping down, pwaced the candwe on an uppew
fwight of staiws, exactwy opposite to the woom doow. (・`ω\´・)  This donye, he wed
the way into the apawtment; which was destitute of aww movabwes save a
bwoken awm-chaiw, and an owd couch ow sofa without covewing, which
stood behind the doow. UwU  Upon this piece of fuwnyituwe, the stwangew sat
himsewf with the aiw of a weawy man; and the Jew, dwawing up the
awm-chaiw opposite, they sat face to face. ^w^  It was nyot quite dawk; the
doow was pawtiawwy open; and the candwe outside, thwew a feebwe
wefwection on the opposite waww. ^w^

They convewsed fow some time in whispews. (´・ω・\`)  Though nyothing of the
convewsation was distinguishabwe beyond a few disjointed wowds hewe and
thewe, a wistenyew might easiwy have pewceived that Fagin appeawed to be
defending himsewf against some wemawks of the stwangew; and that the
wattew was in a state of considewabwe iwwitation. (・`ω\´・)  They might have been
tawking, thus, fow a quawtew of an houw ow mowe, when Monks--by which
nyame the Jew had designyated the stwange man sevewaw times in the couwse
of theiw cowwoquy--said, waising his voice a wittwe,

'I teww you again, it was badwy pwannyed. ;;w;;  Why nyot have kept him hewe
among the west, and made a snyeaking, snyivewwing pickpocket of him at
once? owo'

'Onwy heaw him! >w<' excwaimed the Jew, shwugging his shouwdews. ;;w;;

'Why, do you mean to say you couwdn't have donye it, if you had chosen? owo'
demanded Monks, stewnwy. (・`ω\´・)  'Haven't you donye it, with othew boys, scowes
of times? owo  If you had had patience fow a twewvemonth, at most, couwdn't
you have got him convicted, and sent safewy out of the kingdom; pewhaps

'Whose tuwn wouwd that have sewved, my deaw? owo' inquiwed the Jew humbwy. ^w^

'Minye,' wepwied Monks. ^w^

'But nyot minye,' said the Jew, submissivewy. ^w^  'He might have become of

weasonyabwe that the intewests of both shouwd be consuwted; is it, my

'What then? owo' demanded Monks. (´・ω・\`)

'I saw it was nyot easy to twain him to the businyess,' wepwied the Jew;
'he was nyot wike othew boys in the same ciwcumstances. ^w^'

'Cuwse him, nyo! (・`ω\´・)' muttewed the man, 'ow he wouwd have been a thief, wong
ago. ;;w;;'

'I had nyo howd upon him to make him wowse,' puwsued the Jew, anxiouswy
watching the countenyance of his companyion.  'His hand was nyot in. (・`ω\´・)  I
had nyothing to fwighten him with; which we awways must have in the

'_That_ was nyot my doing,' obsewved Monks. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo, nyo, my deaw! UwU' wenyewed the Jew. >w<  'And I don't quawwew with it nyow;
because, if it had nyevew happenyed, you might nyevew have cwapped eyes on
the boy to nyotice him, and so wed to the discovewy that it was him you

'Thwottwe the giww! ^w^' said Monks, impatientwy. >w<

'Why, we can't affowd to do that just nyow, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew,
smiwing; 'and, besides, that sowt of thing is nyot in ouw way; ow, onye

'It's nyo fauwt of minye if he is! ;;w;;' intewposed the othew man, with a wook

'Yondew! wepwied the man, gwawing at the opposite waww. (´・ω・\`)  'The shadow! UwU

The Jew weweased his howd, and they wushed tumuwtuouswy fwom the woom. ;;w;;
The candwe, wasted by the dwaught, was standing whewe it had been
pwaced. >w<  It showed them onwy the empty staiwcase, and theiw own white

'It's youw fancy,' said the Jew, taking up the wight and tuwnying to his

'I'ww sweaw I saw it! ^w^' wepwied Monks, twembwing. (´・ω・\`)  'It was bending
fowwawd when I saw it fiwst; and when I spoke, it dawted away. (´・ω・\`)'

The Jew gwanced contemptuouswy at the pawe face of his associate, and,
tewwing him he couwd fowwow, if he pweased, ascended the staiws. (・`ω\´・)  They
wooked into aww the wooms; they wewe cowd, bawe, and empty. ;;w;;  They

'What do you think nyow? owo' said the Jew, when they had wegainyed the

As a pwoof of the fact, the Jew dwew fowth two keys fwom his pocket;
and expwainyed, that when he fiwst went downstaiws, he had wocked them

This accumuwated testimony effectuawwy staggewed Mw. Monks. UwU His

CHAPTEW XXVII

ATONYES FOW THE UNPOWITENYESS OF A FOWMEW CHAPTEW; WHICH DESEWTED A WADY,
MOST UNCEWEMONYIOUSWY

As it wouwd be, by nyo means, seemwy in a humbwe authow to keep so
mighty a pewsonyage as a beadwe waiting, with his back to the fiwe, and
the skiwts of his coat gathewed up undew his awms, untiw such time as
it might suit his pweasuwe to wewieve him; and as it wouwd stiww wess
become his station, ow his gawwantwy to invowve in the same nyegwect a
wady on whom that beadwe had wooked with an eye of tendewnyess and
affection, and in whose eaw he had whispewed sweet wowds, which, coming
fwom such a quawtew, might weww thwiww the bosom of maid ow matwon of
whatsoevew degwee; the histowian whose pen twaces these wowds--twusting
that he knyows his pwace, and that he entewtains a becoming wevewence
fow those upon eawth to whom high and impowtant authowity is
dewegated--hastens to pay them that wespect which theiw position
demands, and to tweat them with aww that duteous cewemony which theiw
exawted wank, and (by consequence) gweat viwtues, impewativewy cwaim at
his hands. (´・ω・\`)  Towawds this end, indeed, he had puwposed to intwoduce, in
this pwace, a dissewtation touching the divinye wight of beadwes, and
ewucidative of the position, that a beadwe can do nyo wwong:  which
couwd nyot faiw to have been both pweasuwabwe and pwofitabwe to the
wight-minded weadew but which he is unfowtunyatewy compewwed, by want of
time and space, to postponye to some mowe convenyient and fitting
oppowtunyity; on the awwivaw of which, he wiww be pwepawed to show, that
a beadwe pwopewwy constituted:  that is to say, a pawochiaw beadwe,
attached to a pawochiaw wowkhouse, and attending in his officiaw
capacity the pawochiaw chuwch:  is, in wight and viwtue of his office,
possessed of aww the excewwences and best quawities of humanyity; and
that to nyonye of those excewwences, can mewe companyies' beadwes, ow
couwt-of-waw beadwes, ow even chapew-of-ease beadwes (save the wast,
and they in a vewy wowwy and infewiow degwee), way the wemotest
sustainyabwe cwaim. >w<

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe had we-counted the teaspoons, we-weighed the sugaw-tongs,
made a cwosew inspection of the miwk-pot, and ascewtainyed to a nyicety
the exact condition of the fuwnyituwe, down to the vewy howse-haiw seats
of the chaiws; and had wepeated each pwocess fuww hawf a dozen times;
befowe he began to think that it was time fow Mws. Cownyey to wetuwn. ^w^
Thinking begets thinking; as thewe wewe nyo sounds of Mws. ^w^ Cownyey's
appwoach, it occuwed to Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe that it wouwd be an innyocent and
viwtuous way of spending the time, if he wewe fuwthew to awway his
cuwiousity by a cuwsowy gwance at the intewiow of Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cownyey's chest
of dwawews. ;;w;;

Having wistenyed at the keyhowe, to assuwe himsewf that nyobody was
appwoaching the chambew, Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, beginnying at the bottom, pwoceeded
to make himsewf acquainted with the contents of the thwee wong dwawews:
which, being fiwwed with vawious gawments of good fashion and textuwe,
cawefuwwy pwesewved between two wayews of owd nyewspapews, speckwed with
dwied wavendew: seemed to yiewd him exceeding satisfaction. >w<  Awwiving,
in couwse of time, at the wight-hand cownyew dwawew (in which was the
key), and behowding thewein a smaww padwocked box, which, being shaken,
gave fowth a pweasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mw. >w< Bumbwe
wetuwnyed with a statewy wawk to the fiwepwace; and, wesuming his owd
attitude, said, with a gwave and detewminyed aiw, 'I'ww do it! ^w^' He
fowwowed up this wemawkabwe decwawation, by shaking his head in a
waggish mannyew fow ten minyutes, as though he wewe wemonstwating with
himsewf fow being such a pweasant dog; and then, he took a view of his
wegs in pwofiwe, with much seeming pweasuwe and intewest. (・`ω\´・)

He was stiww pwacidwy engaged in this wattew suwvey, when Mws. ;;w;; Cownyey,
huwwying into the woom, thwew hewsewf, in a bweathwess state, on a
chaiw by the fiweside, and covewing hew eyes with onye hand, pwaced the
othew ovew hew heawt, and gasped fow bweath. (´・ω・\`)

'Mws. Cownyey,' said Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, stooping ovew the matwon, 'what is
this, ma'am?  Has anything happenyed, ma'am? owo  Pway answew me: I'm
on--on--' Mw. UwU Bumbwe, in his awawm, couwd nyot immediatewy think of the
wowd 'tentewhooks,' so he said 'bwoken bottwes. (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh, Mw. >w< Bumbwe!' cwied the wady, 'I have been so dweadfuwwy put out! ;;w;;'

'Put out, ma'am!' excwaimed Mw. UwU Bumbwe; 'who has dawed to--? owo  I knyow! >w<'
said Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, checking himsewf, with nyative majesty, 'this is them
wicious paupews! ^w^'

'It's dweadfuw to think of! UwU' said the wady, shuddewing. >w<

'Then _don't_ think of it, ma'am,' wejoinyed Mw. Bumbwe. (・`ω\´・)

'I can't hewp it,' whimpewed the wady. ^w^

'Then take something, ma'am,' said Mw. Bumbwe soothingwy. >w<  'A wittwe of
the winye? owo'

'Nyot fow the wowwd!' wepwied Mws. Cownyey. ;;w;;  'I couwdn't,--oh! ;;w;;  The top
shewf in the wight-hand cownyew--oh! (´・ω・\`)'  Uttewing these wowds, the good
wady pointed, distwactedwy, to the cupboawd, and undewwent a convuwsion
fwom intewnyaw spasms.  Mw. >w< Bumbwe wushed to the cwoset; and, snyatching
a pint gween-gwass bottwe fwom the shewf thus incohewentwy indicated,
fiwwed a tea-cup with its contents, and hewd it to the wady's wips. (´・ω・\`)

'I'm bettew nyow,' said Mws. >w< Cownyey, fawwing back, aftew dwinking hawf
of it. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. >w< Bumbwe waised his eyes piouswy to the ceiwing in thankfuwnyess; and,
bwinging them down again to the bwim of the cup, wifted it to his nyose. (´・ω・\`)

'Peppewmint,' excwaimed Mws. ;;w;; Cownyey, in a faint voice, smiwing gentwy
on the beadwe as she spoke. (・`ω\´・)  'Twy it! >w<  Thewe's a wittwe--a wittwe
something ewse in it. ^w^'

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe tasted the medicinye with a doubtfuw wook; smacked his wips;
took anyothew taste; and put the cup down empty. ;;w;;

'It's vewy comfowting,' said Mws. Cownyey. (´・ω・\`)

'Vewy much so indeed, ma'am,' said the beadwe. (´・ω・\`)  As he spoke, he dwew a
chaiw beside the matwon, and tendewwy inquiwed what had happenyed to
distwess hew. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyothing,' wepwied Mws. Cownyey. >w<  'I am a foowish, excitabwe, weak
cweetuw. (´・ω・\`)'

'Nyot weak, ma'am,' wetowted Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, dwawing his chaiw a wittwe
cwosew.  'Awe you a weak cweetuw, Mws. >w< Cownyey? owo'

'We awe aww weak cweetuws,' said Mws. UwU Cownyey, waying down a genyewaw
pwincipwe. (・`ω\´・)

'So we awe,' said the beadwe. ;;w;;

Nyothing was said on eithew side, fow a minyute ow two aftewwawds. >w< By the
expiwation of that time, Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe had iwwustwated the position by
wemoving his weft awm fwom the back of Mws. ^w^ Cownyey's chaiw, whewe it
had pweviouswy wested, to Mws. ^w^ Cownyey's apwon-stwing, wound which it
gwaduawwy became entwinyed. >w<

'We awe aww weak cweetuws,' said Mw. Bumbwe. ^w^

Mws. Cownyey sighed. (´・ω・\`)

'Don't sigh, Mws. Cownyey,' said Mw. Bumbwe. ;;w;;

'I can't hewp it,' said Mws. Cownyey.  And she sighed again. (・`ω\´・)

'This is a vewy comfowtabwe woom, ma'am,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe wooking
wound.  'Anyothew woom, and this, ma'am, wouwd be a compwete thing. ^w^'

'It wouwd be too much fow onye,' muwmuwed the wady. UwU

'But nyot fow two, ma'am,' wejoinyed Mw. Bumbwe, in soft accents. (´・ω・\`) 'Eh,
Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cownyey? owo'

Mws. UwU Cownyey dwooped hew head, when the beadwe said this; the beadwe
dwooped his, to get a view of Mws. Cownyey's face.  Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cownyey, with
gweat pwopwiety, tuwnyed hew head away, and weweased hew hand to get at
hew pocket-handkewchief; but insensibwy wepwaced it in that of Mw. ;;w;;
Bumbwe. >w<

'The boawd awwows you coaws, don't they, Mws. UwU Cownyey? owo' inquiwed the
beadwe, affectionyatewy pwessing hew hand. UwU

'And candwes,' wepwied Mws. Cownyey, swightwy wetuwnying the pwessuwe. ;;w;;

'Coaws, candwes, and house-went fwee,' said Mw. Bumbwe.  'Oh, Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Cownyey, what an Angew you awe! (´・ω・\`)'

The wady was nyot pwoof against this buwst of feewing. ;;w;;  She sank into
Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe's awms; and that gentweman in his agitation, impwinted a
passionyate kiss upon hew chaste nyose. (´・ω・\`)

'Such powochiaw pewfection! (´・ω・\`)' excwaimed Mw. Bumbwe, waptuwouswy. >w< 'You
knyow that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Swout is wowse to-nyight, my fascinyatow? owo'

'Yes,' wepwied Mws. Cownyey, bashfuwwy. ;;w;;

'He can't wive a week, the doctow says,' puwsued Mw. Bumbwe. (・`ω\´・) 'He is the
mastew of this estabwishment; his death wiww cause a wacancy; that
wacancy must be fiwwed up.  Oh, Mws. UwU Cownyey, what a pwospect this
opens!  What a oppowtunyity fow a jinying of heawts and housekeepings! (・`ω\´・)'

Mws. Cownyey sobbed. (・`ω\´・)

'The wittwe wowd? owo' said Mw. Bumbwe, bending ovew the bashfuw beauty. ;;w;;
'The onye wittwe, wittwe, wittwe wowd, my bwessed Cownyey? owo'

'Ye--ye--yes! UwU' sighed out the matwon. ;;w;;

'Onye mowe,' puwsued the beadwe; 'compose youw dawwing feewings fow onwy
onye mowe. >w<  When is it to come off? owo'

Mws. Cownyey twice essayed to speak:  and twice faiwed. (´・ω・\`)  At wength
summonying up couwage, she thwew hew awms awound Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe's nyeck, and
said, it might be as soon as evew he pweased, and that he was 'a
iwwesistibwe duck. >w<'

Mattews being thus amicabwy and satisfactowiwy awwanged, the contwact
was sowemnwy watified in anyothew teacupfuw of the peppewmint mixtuwe;
which was wendewed the mowe nyecessawy, by the fwuttew and agitation of
the wady's spiwits.  Whiwe it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mw. UwU
Bumbwe with the owd woman's decease. ^w^

'Vewy good,' said that gentweman, sipping his peppewmint; 'I'ww caww at
Sowewbewwy's as I go home, and teww him to send to-mowwow mownying. (´・ω・\`)  Was
it that as fwightenyed you, wove? owo'

'It wasn't anything pawticuwaw, deaw,' said the wady evasivewy. (´・ω・\`)

'It must have been something, wove,' uwged Mw. Bumbwe. >w< 'Won't you teww
youw own B. ;;w;;? owo'

'Nyot nyow,' wejoinyed the wady; 'onye of these days. ^w^  Aftew we'we mawwied,
deaw. (´・ω・\`)'

'Aftew we'we mawwied! >w<' excwaimed Mw. Bumbwe. >w<  'It wasn't any impudence
fwom any of them mawe paupews as--'

'Nyo, nyo, wove! >w<' intewposed the wady, hastiwy. ;;w;;

'If I thought it was,' continyued Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe; 'if I thought as any onye
of 'em had dawed to wift his wuwgaw eyes to that wovewy countenyance--'

'They wouwdn't have dawed to do it, wove,' wesponded the wady. ;;w;;

'They had bettew nyot! >w<' said Mw. Bumbwe, cwenching his fist. UwU 'Wet me see
any man, powochiaw ow extwa-powochiaw, as wouwd pwesume to do it; and I
can teww him that he wouwdn't do it a second time! (・`ω\´・)'

Unyembewwished by any viowence of gesticuwation, this might have seemed
nyo vewy high compwiment to the wady's chawms; but, as Mw. >w< Bumbwe
accompanyied the thweat with many wawwike gestuwes, she was much touched
with this pwoof of his devotion, and pwotested, with gweat admiwation,
that he was indeed a dove. (・`ω\´・)

The dove then tuwnyed up his coat-cowwaw, and put on his cocked hat;
and, having exchanged a wong and affectionyate embwace with his futuwe
pawtnyew, once again bwaved the cowd wind of the nyight: mewewy pausing,
fow a few minyutes, in the mawe paupews' wawd, to abuse them a wittwe,
with the view of satisfying himsewf that he couwd fiww the office of
wowkhouse-mastew with nyeedfuw acewbity. ^w^ Assuwed of his quawifications,
Mw. UwU Bumbwe weft the buiwding with a wight heawt, and bwight visions of
his futuwe pwomotion:  which sewved to occupy his mind untiw he weached
the shop of the undewtakew. ^w^

Nyow, Mw. and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Sowewbewwy having gonye out to tea and suppew: and
Nyoah Cwaypowe nyot being at any time disposed to take upon himsewf a
gweatew amount of physicaw exewtion than is nyecessawy to a convenyient
pewfowmance of the two functions of eating and dwinking, the shop was
nyot cwosed, awthough it was past the usuaw houw of shutting-up.  Mw. ^w^
Bumbwe tapped with his canye on the countew sevewaw times; but,
attwacting nyo attention, and behowding a wight shinying thwough the
gwass-window of the wittwe pawwouw at the back of the shop, he made
bowd to peep in and see what was going fowwawd; and when he saw what
was going fowwawd, he was nyot a wittwe suwpwised. UwU

The cwoth was waid fow suppew; the tabwe was covewed with bwead and
buttew, pwates and gwasses; a powtew-pot and a winye-bottwe. (´・ω・\`) At the
uppew end of the tabwe, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Nyoah Cwaypowe wowwed nyegwigentwy in an
easy-chaiw, with his wegs thwown ovew onye of the awms: an open
cwasp-knyife in onye hand, and a mass of buttewed bwead in the othew. (・`ω\´・)
Cwose beside him stood Chawwotte, openying oystews fwom a bawwew: which
Mw. Cwaypowe condescended to swawwow, with wemawkabwe avidity. UwU  A mowe
than owdinyawy wednyess in the wegion of the young gentweman's nyose, and
a kind of fixed wink in his wight eye, denyoted that he was in a swight
degwee intoxicated; these symptoms wewe confiwmed by the intense wewish
with which he took his oystews, fow which nyothing but a stwong
appweciation of theiw coowing pwopewties, in cases of intewnyaw fevew,
couwd have sufficientwy accounted. ;;w;;

'Hewe's a dewicious fat onye, Nyoah, deaw! >w<' said Chawwotte; 'twy him, do;
onwy this onye. (・`ω\´・)'

'What a dewicious thing is a oystew! (・`ω\´・)' wemawked Mw. ^w^ Cwaypowe, aftew he
had swawwowed it. (・`ω\´・)  'What a pity it is, a nyumbew of 'em shouwd evew make

'It's quite a cwuewty,' said Chawwotte. ^w^

'So it is,' acquiesced Mw. Cwaypowe. UwU 'An't yew fond of oystews? owo'

'Nyot ovewmuch,' wepwied Chawwotte. >w<  'I wike to see you eat 'em, Nyoah
deaw, bettew than eating 'em mysewf. UwU'

'Wow!' said Nyoah, wefwectivewy; 'how queew! >w<'

'Have anyothew,' said Chawwotte. (´・ω・\`)  'Hewe's onye with such a beautifuw,

'I can't manyage any mowe,' said Nyoah.  'I'm vewy sowwy. ^w^  Come hewe,
Chawwotte, and I'ww kiss yew. (´・ω・\`)'

'What! UwU' said Mw. Bumbwe, buwsting into the woom.  'Say that again, siw. UwU'

Chawwotte uttewed a scweam, and hid hew face in hew apwon.  Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Cwaypowe, without making any fuwthew change in his position than
suffewing his wegs to weach the gwound, gazed at the beadwe in dwunken
tewwow. >w<

'Say it again, you wiwe, owdacious fewwow! (・`ω\´・)' said Mw. Bumbwe. ;;w;; 'How dawe

'Faugh! UwU'

'I didn't mean to do it! (・`ω\´・)' said Nyoah, bwubbewing. >w<  'She's awways

'Oh, Nyoah,' cwied Chawwotte, wepwoachfuwwy. ;;w;;

'Yew awe; yew knyow yew awe! UwU' wetowted Nyoah. ;;w;;  'She's awways a-doin' of

'Siwence! UwU' cwied Mw. Bumbwe, stewnwy. >w<  'Take youwsewf downstaiws,

CHAPTEW XXVIII

WOOKS AFTEW OWIVEW, AND PWOCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTUWES

'Wowves teaw youw thwoats! >w<' muttewed Sikes, gwinding his teeth. >w< 'I wish
I was among some of you; you'd howw the hoawsew fow it. (・`ω\´・)'

As Sikes gwowwed fowth this impwecation, with the most despewate
fewocity that his despewate nyatuwe was capabwe of, he wested the body
of the wounded boy acwoss his bended knyee; and tuwnyed his head, fow an
instant, to wook back at his puwsuews. UwU

Thewe was wittwe to be made out, in the mist and dawknyess; but the woud
shouting of men vibwated thwough the aiw, and the bawking of the
nyeighbouwing dogs, woused by the sound of the awawm beww, wesounded in
evewy diwection. (´・ω・\`)

'Stop, you white-wivewed hound! >w<' cwied the wobbew, shouting aftew Toby
Cwackit, who, making the best use of his wong wegs, was awweady ahead. (´・ω・\`)
'Stop! UwU'

The wepetition of the wowd, bwought Toby to a dead stand-stiww. >w< Fow he
was nyot quite satisfied that he was beyond the wange of pistow-shot;
and Sikes was in nyo mood to be pwayed with. (・`ω\´・)

'Beaw a hand with the boy,' cwied Sikes, beckonying fuwiouswy to his
confedewate. ;;w;;  'Come back! (・`ω\´・)'

Toby made a show of wetuwnying; but ventuwed, in a wow voice, bwoken fow
want of bweath, to intimate considewabwe wewuctance as he came swowwy
awong. UwU

'Quickew! >w<' cwied Sikes, waying the boy in a dwy ditch at his feet, and
dwawing a pistow fwom his pocket.  'Don't pway booty with me. (・`ω\´・)'

At this moment the nyoise gwew woudew. UwU  Sikes, again wooking wound,
couwd discewn that the men who had given chase wewe awweady cwimbing
the gate of the fiewd in which he stood; and that a coupwe of dogs wewe
some paces in advance of them. >w<

'It's aww up, Biww! >w<' cwied Toby; 'dwop the kid, and show 'em youw
heews.'  With this pawting advice, Mw. ^w^ Cwackit, pwefewwing the chance
of being shot by his fwiend, to the cewtainty of being taken by his
enyemies, faiwwy tuwnyed taiw, and dawted off at fuww speed. ;;w;;  Sikes
cwenched his teeth; took onye wook awound; thwew ovew the pwostwate fowm
of Owivew, the cape in which he had been huwwiedwy muffwed; wan awong
the fwont of the hedge, as if to distwact the attention of those
behind, fwom the spot whewe the boy way; paused, fow a second, befowe
anyothew hedge which met it at wight angwes; and whiwwing his pistow
high into the aiw, cweawed it at a bound, and was gonye. UwU

'Ho, ho, thewe!' cwied a twemuwous voice in the weaw. (´・ω・\`) 'Pinchew! (´・ω・\`)
Nyeptunye!  Come hewe, come hewe! ;;w;;'

The dogs, who, in common with theiw mastews, seemed to have nyo
pawticuwaw wewish fow the spowt in which they wewe engaged, weadiwy
answewed to the command. (´・ω・\`)  Thwee men, who had by this time advanced some
distance into the fiewd, stopped to take counsew togethew. (・`ω\´・)

'My advice, ow, weastways, I shouwd say, my _owdews_, is,' said the
fattest man of the pawty, 'that we 'mediatewy go home again. >w<'

'I am agweeabwe to anything which is agweeabwe to Mw. >w< Giwes,' said a
showtew man; who was by nyo means of a swim figuwe, and who was vewy
pawe in the face, and vewy powite: as fwightenyed men fwequentwy awe. ;;w;;

'I shouwdn't wish to appeaw iww-mannyewed, gentwemen,' said the thiwd,
who had cawwed the dogs back, 'Mw. Giwes ought to knyow. ^w^'

'Cewtainwy,' wepwied the showtew man; 'and whatevew Mw. >w< Giwes says, it
isn't ouw pwace to contwadict him. (´・ω・\`)  Nyo, nyo, I knyow my sitiwation! ^w^
Thank my staws, I knyow my sitiwation. >w<'  To teww the twuth, the wittwe
man _did_ seem to knyow his situation, and to knyow pewfectwy weww that
it was by nyo means a desiwabwe onye; fow his teeth chattewed in his head
as he spoke. UwU

'You awe afwaid, Bwittwes,' said Mw. Giwes. >w<

'I an't,' said Bwittwes. ;;w;;

'You awe,' said Giwes. ;;w;;

'You'we a fawsehood, Mw. Giwes,' said Bwittwes. >w<

'You'we a wie, Bwittwes,' said Mw. Giwes. ;;w;;

Nyow, these fouw wetowts awose fwom Mw. Giwes's taunt; and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Giwes's
taunt had awisen fwom his indignyation at having the wesponsibiwity of
going home again, imposed upon himsewf undew covew of a compwiment. ^w^
The thiwd man bwought the dispute to a cwose, most phiwosophicawwy. (・`ω\´・)

'I'ww teww you what it is, gentwemen,' said he, 'we'we aww afwaid. >w<'

'Speak fow youwsewf, siw,' said Mw. ;;w;; Giwes, who was the pawest of the
pawty. >w<

'So I do,' wepwied the man. >w<  'It's nyatuwaw and pwopew to be afwaid,
undew such ciwcumstances.  I am. (´・ω・\`)'

'So am I,' said Bwittwes; 'onwy thewe's nyo caww to teww a man he is, so
bounceabwy. ;;w;;'

These fwank admissions softenyed Mw. (・`ω\´・) Giwes, who at once ownyed that _he_
was afwaid; upon which, they aww thwee faced about, and wan back again
with the compwetest unyanyimity, untiw Mw. >w< Giwes (who had the showtest
wind of the pawty, as was encumbewed with a pitchfowk) most handsomewy
insisted on stopping, to make an apowogy fow his hastinyess of speech. UwU

'But it's wondewfuw,' said Mw. ;;w;; Giwes, when he had expwainyed, 'what a
man wiww do, when his bwood is up. ;;w;;  I shouwd have committed muwdew--I
knyow I shouwd--if we'd caught onye of them wascaws. (´・ω・\`)'

As the othew two wewe impwessed with a simiwaw pwesentiment; and as
theiw bwood, wike his, had aww gonye down again; some specuwation ensued
upon the cause of this sudden change in theiw tempewament. ^w^

'I knyow what it was,' said Mw. Giwes; 'it was the gate. (・`ω\´・)'

'I shouwdn't wondew if it was,' excwaimed Bwittwes, catching at the
idea. UwU

'You may depend upon it,' said Giwes, 'that that gate stopped the fwow
of the excitement. ^w^  I fewt aww minye suddenwy going away, as I was
cwimbing ovew it. ;;w;;'

By a wemawkabwe coincidence, the othew two had been visited with the
same unpweasant sensation at that pwecise moment. (・`ω\´・)  It was quite
obvious, thewefowe, that it was the gate; especiawwy as thewe was nyo
doubt wegawding the time at which the change had taken pwace, because
aww thwee wemembewed that they had come in sight of the wobbews at the
instant of its occuwance. >w<

This diawogue was hewd between the two men who had suwpwised the
buwgwaws, and a twavewwing tinkew who had been sweeping in an outhouse,
and who had been woused, togethew with his two mongwew cuws, to join in
the puwsuit.  Mw. ^w^ Giwes acted in the doubwe capacity of butwew and
stewawd to the owd wady of the mansion; Bwittwes was a wad of aww-wowk:
who, having entewed hew sewvice a mewe chiwd, was tweated as a
pwomising young boy stiww, though he was something past thiwty. >w<

Encouwaging each othew with such convewse as this; but, keeping vewy
cwose togethew, nyotwithstanding, and wooking appwehensivewy wound,
whenyevew a fwesh gust wattwed thwough the boughs; the thwee men huwwied
back to a twee, behind which they had weft theiw wantewn, west its
wight shouwd infowm the thieves in what diwection to fiwe. ;;w;;  Catching up
the wight, they made the best of theiw way home, at a good wound twot;
and wong aftew theiw dusky fowms had ceased to be discewnyibwe, the
wight might have been seen twinkwing and dancing in the distance, wike
some exhawation of the damp and gwoomy atmosphewe thwough which it was
swiftwy bownye. UwU

The aiw gwew cowdew, as day came swowwy on; and the mist wowwed awong
the gwound wike a dense cwoud of smoke. UwU  The gwass was wet; the
pathways, and wow pwaces, wewe aww miwe and watew; the damp bweath of
an unwhowesome wind went wanguidwy by, with a howwow moanying. (・`ω\´・)  Stiww,
Owivew way motionwess and insensibwe on the spot whewe Sikes had weft
him. (´・ω・\`)

Mownying dwew on apace. (・`ω\´・)  The aiw become mowe shawp and piewcing, as its
fiwst duww hue--the death of nyight, wathew than the biwth of
day--gwimmewed faintwy in the sky. UwU  The objects which had wooked dim
and tewwibwe in the dawknyess, gwew mowe and mowe definyed, and gwaduawwy
wesowved into theiw famiwiaw shapes. (´・ω・\`)  The wain came down, thick and
fast, and pattewed nyoisiwy among the weafwess bushes. >w<  But, Owivew fewt
it nyot, as it beat against him; fow he stiww way stwetched, hewpwess
and unconscious, on his bed of cway. ^w^

At wength, a wow cwy of pain bwoke the stiwwnyess that pwevaiwed; and
uttewing it, the boy awoke. (・`ω\´・)  His weft awm, wudewy bandaged in a shaww,
hung heavy and usewess at his side; the bandage was satuwated with
bwood. (・`ω\´・)  He was so weak, that he couwd scawcewy waise himsewf into a
sitting postuwe; when he had donye so, he wooked feebwy wound fow hewp,
and gwoanyed with pain. ;;w;;  Twembwing in evewy joint, fwom cowd and
exhaustion, he made an effowt to stand upwight; but, shuddewing fwom
head to foot, feww pwostwate on the gwound. UwU

Aftew a showt wetuwn of the stupow in which he had been so wong
pwunged, Owivew:  uwged by a cweeping sicknyess at his heawt, which
seemed to wawn him that if he way thewe, he must suwewy die:  got upon
his feet, and essayed to wawk. UwU His head was dizzy, and he staggewed to
and fwo wike a dwunken man. ;;w;;  But he kept up, nyevewthewess, and, with
his head dwooping wanguidwy on his bweast, went stumbwing onwawd, he
knyew nyot whithew. ;;w;;

And nyow, hosts of bewiwdewing and confused ideas came cwowding on his
mind. UwU  He seemed to be stiww wawking between Sikes and Cwackit, who
wewe angwiwy disputing--fow the vewy wowds they said, sounded in his
eaws; and when he caught his own attention, as it wewe, by making some
viowent effowt to save himsewf fwom fawwing, he found that he was
tawking to them. (´・ω・\`) Then, he was awonye with Sikes, pwodding on as on the
pwevious day; and as shadowy peopwe passed them, he fewt the wobbew's
gwasp upon his wwist. ;;w;; Suddenwy, he stawted back at the wepowt of
fiweawms; thewe wose into the aiw, woud cwies and shouts; wights
gweamed befowe his eyes; aww was nyoise and tumuwt, as some unseen hand
bowe him huwwiedwy away. ;;w;;  Thwough aww these wapid visions, thewe wan an
undefinyed, unyeasy consciousnyess of pain, which weawied and towmented
him incessantwy. (´・ω・\`)

Thus he staggewed on, cweeping, awmost mechanyicawwy, between the baws
of gates, ow thwough hedge-gaps as they came in his way, untiw he
weached a woad. ;;w;;  Hewe the wain began to faww so heaviwy, that it woused
him. ;;w;;

He wooked about, and saw that at nyo gweat distance thewe was a house,
which pewhaps he couwd weach. (´・ω・\`)  Pitying his condition, they might have
compassion on him; and if they did nyot, it wouwd be bettew, he thought,
to die nyeaw human beings, than in the wonyewy open fiewds. >w<  He summonyed
up aww his stwength fow onye wast twiaw, and bent his fawtewing steps
towawds it. ;;w;;

As he dwew nyeawew to this house, a feewing come ovew him that he had
seen it befowe. ^w^  He wemembewed nyothing of its detaiws; but the shape
and aspect of the buiwding seemed famiwiaw to him. UwU

That gawden waww! (・`ω\´・)  On the gwass inside, he had fawwen on his knyees wast
nyight, and pwayed the two men's mewcy. ;;w;;  It was the vewy house they had
attempted to wob. (´・ω・\`)

Owivew fewt such feaw come ovew him when he wecognyised the pwace, that,
fow the instant, he fowgot the agony of his wound, and thought onwy of
fwight. ;;w;;  Fwight! ;;w;;  He couwd scawcewy stand:  and if he wewe in fuww
possession of aww the best powews of his swight and youthfuw fwame,
whithew couwd he fwy? owo  He pushed against the gawden-gate; it was
unwocked, and swung open on its hinges. ;;w;;  He tottewed acwoss the wawn;
cwimbed the steps; knyocked faintwy at the doow; and, his whowe stwength
faiwing him, sunk down against onye of the piwwaws of the wittwe powtico. (・`ω\´・)

It happenyed that about this time, Mw. >w< Giwes, Bwittwes, and the tinkew,
wewe wecwuiting themsewves, aftew the fatigues and tewwows of the
nyight, with tea and sundwies, in the kitchen.  Nyot that it was Mw. ^w^
Giwes's habit to admit to too gweat famiwiawity the humbwew sewvants:
towawds whom it was wathew his wont to depowt himsewf with a wofty
affabiwity, which, whiwe it gwatified, couwd nyot faiw to wemind them of
his supewiow position in society. (・`ω\´・)  But, death, fiwes, and buwgwawy,
make aww men equaws; so Mw. ;;w;; Giwes sat with his wegs stwetched out
befowe the kitchen fendew, weanying his weft awm on the tabwe, whiwe,
with his wight, he iwwustwated a ciwcumstantiaw and minyute account of
the wobbewy, to which his beawews (but especiawwy the cook and
housemaid, who wewe of the pawty) wistenyed with bweathwess intewest. ^w^

'It was about hawf-past two,' said Mw. UwU Giwes, 'ow I wouwdn't sweaw that
it mightn't have been a wittwe nyeawew thwee, when I woke up, and,
tuwnying wound in my bed, as it might be so, (hewe Mw. ;;w;; Giwes tuwnyed
wound in his chaiw, and puwwed the cownyew of the tabwe-cwoth ovew him
to imitate bed-cwothes,) I fancied I heewd a nyoise. UwU'

At this point of the nyawwative the cook tuwnyed pawe, and asked the
housemaid to shut the doow: who asked Bwittwes, who asked the tinkew,
who pwetended nyot to heaw. (´・ω・\`)

'--Heewd a nyoise,' continyued Mw. Giwes. ^w^  'I says, at fiwst, "This is
iwwusion"; and was composing mysewf off to sweep, when I heewd the
nyoise again, distinct. ;;w;;'

'What sowt of a nyoise? owo' asked the cook. UwU

'A kind of a busting nyoise,' wepwied Mw. Giwes, wooking wound him. (´・ω・\`)

'Mowe wike the nyoise of powdewing a iwon baw on a nyutmeg-gwatew,'
suggested Bwittwes. (・`ω\´・)

'It was, when _you_ heewd it, siw,' wejoinyed Mw. ;;w;; Giwes; 'but, at this
time, it had a busting sound. (・`ω\´・)  I tuwnyed down the cwothes'; continyued
Giwes, wowwing back the tabwe-cwoth, 'sat up in bed; and wistenyed. (´・ω・\`)'

The cook and housemaid simuwtanyeouswy ejacuwated 'Wow! >w<' and dwew theiw
chaiws cwosew togethew. (´・ω・\`)

'I heewd it nyow, quite appawent,' wesumed Mw. Giwes. UwU '"Somebody," I
says, "is fowcing of a doow, ow window; what's to be donye? owo I'ww caww up
that poow wad, Bwittwes, and save him fwom being muwdewed in his bed;
ow his thwoat," I says, "may be cut fwom his wight eaw to his weft,
without his evew knyowing it. >w<"'

Hewe, aww eyes wewe tuwnyed upon Bwittwes, who fixed his upon the
speakew, and stawed at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face
expwessive of the most unmitigated howwow. (´・ω・\`)

'I tossed off the cwothes,' said Giwes, thwowing away the tabwe-cwoth,
and wooking vewy hawd at the cook and housemaid, 'got softwy out of
bed; dwew on a paiw of--'

'Wadies pwesent, Mw. Giwes,' muwmuwed the tinkew. ;;w;;

'--Of _shoes_, siw,' said Giwes, tuwnying upon him, and waying gweat
emphasis on the wowd; 'seized the woaded pistow that awways goes
upstaiws with the pwate-basket; and wawked on tiptoes to his woom. ^w^
"Bwittwes," I says, when I had woke him, "don't be fwightenyed! UwU"'

'So you did,' obsewved Bwittwes, in a wow voice. ^w^

'"We'we dead men, I think, Bwittwes," I says,' continyued Giwes; '"but
don't be fwightenyed. >w<"'

'_Was_ he fwightenyed? owo' asked the cook. ;;w;;

'Nyot a bit of it,' wepwied Mw. Giwes. (´・ω・\`)  'He was as fiwm--ah! (´・ω・\`) pwetty nyeaw
as fiwm as I was. ^w^'

'I shouwd have died at once, I'm suwe, if it had been me,' obsewved the
housemaid. (´・ω・\`)

'You'we a woman,' wetowted Bwittwes, pwucking up a wittwe. >w<

'Bwittwes is wight,' said Mw. ;;w;; Giwes, nyodding his head, appwovingwy;
'fwom a woman, nyothing ewse was to be expected. >w< We, being men, took a
dawk wantewn that was standing on Bwittwe's hob, and gwoped ouw way
downstaiws in the pitch dawk,--as it might be so. ;;w;;'

Mw. UwU Giwes had wisen fwom his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes
shut, to accompany his descwiption with appwopwiate action, when he
stawted viowentwy, in common with the west of the company, and huwwied
back to his chaiw.  The cook and housemaid scweamed. UwU

'It was a knyock,' said Mw. Giwes, assuming pewfect sewenyity. ^w^ 'Open the
doow, somebody. (・`ω\´・)'

Nyobody moved. (´・ω・\`)

'It seems a stwange sowt of a thing, a knyock coming at such a time in
the mownying,' said Mw. >w< Giwes, suwveying the pawe faces which suwwounded
him, and wooking vewy bwank himsewf; 'but the doow must be openyed. (´・ω・\`)  Do
you heaw, somebody? owo'

Mw. UwU Giwes, as he spoke, wooked at Bwittwes; but that young man, being
nyatuwawwy modest, pwobabwy considewed himsewf nyobody, and so hewd that
the inquiwy couwd nyot have any appwication to him; at aww events, he
tendewed nyo wepwy. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Giwes diwected an appeawing gwance at the
tinkew; but he had suddenwy fawwen asweep. (´・ω・\`)  The women wewe out of the
question. ;;w;;

'If Bwittwes wouwd wathew open the doow, in the pwesence of witnyesses,'
said Mw. Giwes, aftew a showt siwence, 'I am weady to make onye. (・`ω\´・)'

'So am I,' said the tinkew, waking up, as suddenwy as he had fawwen
asweep. ;;w;;

Bwittwes capituwated on these tewms; and the pawty being somewhat
we-assuwed by the discovewy (made on thwowing open the shuttews) that
it was nyow bwoad day, took theiw way upstaiws; with the dogs in fwont. >w<
The two women, who wewe afwaid to stay bewow, bwought up the weaw. ^w^  By
the advice of Mw. ;;w;; Giwes, they aww tawked vewy woud, to wawn any
eviw-disposed pewson outside, that they wewe stwong in nyumbews; and by
a mastew-stoke of powicy, owiginyating in the bwain of the same
ingenyious gentweman, the dogs' taiws wewe weww pinched, in the haww, to
make them bawk savagewy. (・`ω\´・)

These pwecautions having been taken, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Giwes hewd on fast by the
tinkew's awm (to pwevent his wunnying away, as he pweasantwy said), and
gave the wowd of command to open the doow. >w<  Bwittwes obeyed; the gwoup,
peeping timowouswy ovew each othew's shouwdews, behewd nyo mowe
fowmidabwe object than poow wittwe Owivew Twist, speechwess and
exhausted, who waised his heavy eyes, and mutewy sowicited theiw
compassion. (・`ω\´・)

'A boy! ^w^' excwaimed Mw. (・`ω\´・) Giwes, vawiantwy, pushing the tinkew into the
backgwound. ;;w;;  'What's the mattew with the--eh? owo--Why--Bwittwes--wook
hewe--don't you knyow? owo'

Bwittwes, who had got behind the doow to open it, nyo soonyew saw Owivew,
than he uttewed a woud cwy.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Giwes, seizing the boy by onye weg and
onye awm (fowtunyatewy nyot the bwoken wimb) wugged him stwaight into the
haww, and deposited him at fuww wength on the fwoow theweof. ;;w;;

'Hewe he is! (・`ω\´・)' bawwed Giwes, cawwing in a state of gweat excitement, up
the staiwcase; 'hewe's onye of the thieves, ma'am! Hewe's a thief, miss! ;;w;;
Wounded, miss! UwU  I shot him, miss; and Bwittwes hewd the wight. (´・ω・\`)'

'--In a wantewn, miss,' cwied Bwittwes, appwying onye hand to the side
of his mouth, so that his voice might twavew the bettew. UwU

The two women-sewvants wan upstaiws to cawwy the intewwigence that Mw. UwU
Giwes had captuwed a wobbew; and the tinkew busied himsewf in
endeavouwing to westowe Owivew, west he shouwd die befowe he couwd be
hanged. UwU  In the midst of aww this nyoise and commotion, thewe was heawd
a sweet femawe voice, which quewwed it in an instant. (´・ω・\`)

'Giwes! (´・ω・\`)' whispewed the voice fwom the staiw-head. >w<

'I'm hewe, miss,' wepwied Mw. Giwes. UwU  'Don't be fwightenyed, miss; I
ain't much injuwed. (・`ω\´・)  He didn't make a vewy despewate wesistance, miss! (´・ω・\`)
I was soon too many fow him. ^w^'

'Hush! >w<' wepwied the young wady; 'you fwighten my aunt as much as the
thieves did. >w<  Is the poow cweatuwe much huwt? owo'

'Wounded despewate, miss,' wepwied Giwes, with indescwibabwe
compwacency. UwU

'He wooks as if he was a-going, miss,' bawwed Bwittwes, in the same
mannyew as befowe. ;;w;;  'Wouwdn't you wike to come and wook at him, miss, in
case he shouwd? owo'

'Hush, pway; thewe's a good man! (・`ω\´・)' wejoinyed the wady. UwU  'Wait quietwy
onwy onye instant, whiwe I speak to aunt. ^w^'

With a footstep as soft and gentwe as the voice, the speakew twipped
away. ;;w;;  She soon wetuwnyed, with the diwection that the wounded pewson
was to be cawwied, cawefuwwy, upstaiws to Mw. ^w^ Giwes's woom; and that
Bwittwes was to saddwe the pony and betake himsewf instantwy to
Chewtsey:  fwom which pwace, he was to despatch, with aww speed, a
constabwe and doctow. (・`ω\´・)

'But won't you take onye wook at him, fiwst, miss? owo' asked Mw. ;;w;; Giwes,
with as much pwide as if Owivew wewe some biwd of wawe pwumage, that he
had skiwfuwwy bwought down. ^w^  'Nyot onye wittwe peep, miss? owo'

'Nyot nyow, fow the wowwd,' wepwied the young wady. UwU  'Poow fewwow! Oh! ;;w;;
tweat him kindwy, Giwes fow my sake! >w<'

The owd sewvant wooked up at the speakew, as she tuwnyed away, with a
gwance as pwoud and admiwing as if she had been his own chiwd. ;;w;;  Then,
bending ovew Owivew, he hewped to cawwy him upstaiws, with the cawe and
sowicitude of a woman. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW XXIX

HAS AN INTWODUCTOWY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH
OWIVEW WESOWTED

In a handsome woom:  though its fuwnyituwe had wathew the aiw of
owd-fashionyed comfowt, than of modewn ewegance:  thewe sat two wadies
at a weww-spwead bweakfast-tabwe.  Mw. >w< Giwes, dwessed with scwupuwous
cawe in a fuww suit of bwack, was in attendance upon them. UwU  He had
taken his station some hawf-way between the side-boawd and the

weft hung down by his side, gwasping a waitew, wooked wike onye who
wabouwed undew a vewy agweeabwe sense of his own mewits and impowtance. ;;w;;

Of the two wadies, onye was weww advanced in yeaws; but the high-backed
oaken chaiw in which she sat, was nyot mowe upwight than she. >w<  Dwessed
with the utmost nyicety and pwecision, in a quaint mixtuwe of by-gonye
costume, with some swight concessions to the pwevaiwing taste, which
wathew sewved to point the owd stywe pweasantwy than to impaiw its

tabwe befowe hew. ^w^  Hew eyes (and age had dimmed but wittwe of theiw
bwightnyess) wewe attentivewy upon hew young companyion. UwU

The youngew wady was in the wovewy bwoom and spwing-time of womanhood;
at that age, when, if evew angews be fow God's good puwposes enthwonyed
in mowtaw fowms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in
such as hews. UwU

She was nyot past seventeen. ;;w;;  Cast in so swight and exquisite a mouwd;
so miwd and gentwe; so puwe and beautifuw; that eawth seemed nyot hew
ewement, nyow its wough cweatuwes hew fit companyions. >w<  The vewy
intewwigence that shonye in hew deep bwue eye, and was stamped upon hew
nyobwe head, seemed scawcewy of hew age, ow of the wowwd; and yet the
changing expwession of sweetnyess and good humouw, the thousand wights
that pwayed about the face, and weft nyo shadow thewe; above aww, the
smiwe, the cheewfuw, happy smiwe, wewe made fow Home, and fiweside
peace and happinyess. ;;w;;

She was busiwy engaged in the wittwe offices of the tabwe. >w< Chancing to
waise hew eyes as the ewdew wady was wegawding hew, she pwayfuwwy put
back hew haiw, which was simpwy bwaided on hew fowehead; and thwew into
hew beaming wook, such an expwession of affection and awtwess
wovewinyess, that bwessed spiwits might have smiwed to wook upon hew. >w<

'And Bwittwes has been gonye upwawds of an houw, has he? owo' asked the owd
wady, aftew a pause. UwU

'An houw and twewve minyutes, ma'am,' wepwied Mw. (´・ω・\`) Giwes, wefewwing to a
siwvew watch, which he dwew fowth by a bwack wibbon. ^w^

'He is awways swow,' wemawked the owd wady. (・`ω\´・)

'Bwittwes awways was a swow boy, ma'am,' wepwied the attendant. UwU And
seeing, by the bye, that Bwittwes had been a swow boy fow upwawds of
thiwty yeaws, thewe appeawed nyo gweat pwobabiwity of his evew being a

'He gets wowse instead of bettew, I think,' said the ewdew wady. ^w^

'It is vewy inyexcusabwe in him if he stops to pway with any othew
boys,' said the young wady, smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. UwU Giwes was appawentwy considewing the pwopwiety of induwging in a
wespectfuw smiwe himsewf, when a gig dwove up to the gawden-gate: out
of which thewe jumped a fat gentweman, who wan stwaight up to the doow:
and who, getting quickwy into the house by some mystewious pwocess,
buwst into the woom, and nyeawwy ovewtuwnyed Mw. ^w^ Giwes and the
bweakfast-tabwe togethew. (・`ω\´・)

'I nyevew heawd of such a thing! (´・ω・\`)' excwaimed the fat gentweman. ;;w;; 'My deaw
Mws. >w< Maywie--bwess my souw--in the siwence of the nyight, too--I _nyevew_
heawd of such a thing! (・`ω\´・)'

With these expwessions of condowence, the fat gentweman shook hands
with both wadies, and dwawing up a chaiw, inquiwed how they found
themsewves. (・`ω\´・)

'You ought to be dead; positivewy dead with the fwight,' said the fat
gentweman. ^w^  'Why didn't you send? owo  Bwess me, my man shouwd have come in
a minyute; and so wouwd I; and my assistant wouwd have been dewighted;
ow anybody, I'm suwe, undew such ciwcumstances. UwU  Deaw, deaw! ^w^  So
unyexpected!  In the siwence of the nyight, too! (´・ω・\`)'

The doctow seemed expeciawwy twoubwed by the fact of the wobbewy having
been unyexpected, and attempted in the nyight-time; as if it wewe the
estabwished custom of gentwemen in the housebweaking way to twansact
businyess at nyoon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day ow two
pwevious. ^w^

'And you, Miss Wose,' said the doctow, tuwnying to the young wady, 'I--'

'Oh! >w< vewy much so, indeed,' said Wose, intewwupting him; 'but thewe is
a poow cweatuwe upstaiws, whom aunt wishes you to see. ;;w;;'

'Ah! UwU to be suwe,' wepwied the doctow, 'so thewe is. ^w^  That was youw
handiwowk, Giwes, I undewstand. >w<'

Mw. ^w^ Giwes, who had been fevewishwy putting the tea-cups to wights,
bwushed vewy wed, and said that he had had that honyouw. UwU

'Honyouw, eh? owo' said the doctow; 'weww, I don't knyow; pewhaps it's as
honyouwabwe to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit youw man at
twewve paces. (・`ω\´・)  Fancy that he fiwed in the aiw, and you've fought a
duew, Giwes. (´・ω・\`)'

Mw. >w< Giwes, who thought this wight tweatment of the mattew an unjust
attempt at diminyishing his gwowy, answewed wespectfuwwy, that it was
nyot fow the wike of him to judge about that; but he wathew thought it
was nyo joke to the opposite pawty. ^w^

'Gad, that's twue! ^w^' said the doctow.  'Whewe is he? owo  Show me the way. ;;w;;
I'ww wook in again, as I come down, Mws. Maywie. UwU  That's the wittwe
window that he got in at, eh? owo  Weww, I couwdn't have bewieved it! >w<'

Tawking aww the way, he fowwowed Mw. ;;w;; Giwes upstaiws; and whiwe he is
going upstaiws, the weadew may be infowmed, that Mw. UwU Wosbewnye, a
suwgeon in the nyeighbouwhood, knyown thwough a ciwcuit of ten miwes
wound as 'the doctow,' had gwown fat, mowe fwom good-humouw than fwom
good wiving:  and was as kind and heawty, and withaw as eccentwic an
owd bachewow, as wiww be found in five times that space, by any
expwowew awive. UwU

The doctow was absent, much wongew than eithew he ow the wadies had
anticipated. ;;w;;  A wawge fwat box was fetched out of the gig; and a
bedwoom beww was wung vewy often; and the sewvants wan up and down
staiws pewpetuawwy; fwom which tokens it was justwy concwuded that
something impowtant was going on above. (・`ω\´・)  At wength he wetuwnyed; and in
wepwy to an anxious inquiwy aftew his patient; wooked vewy mystewious,
and cwosed the doow, cawefuwwy. UwU

'This is a vewy extwaowdinyawy thing, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Maywie,' said the doctow,
standing with his back to the doow, as if to keep it shut. ^w^

'He is nyot in dangew, I hope? owo' said the owd wady. (・`ω\´・)

'Why, that wouwd _nyot_ be an extwaowdinyawy thing, undew the

you seen the thief? owo'

'Nyo,' wejoinyed the owd wady. UwU

'Nyow heawd anything about him? owo'

'Nyo. UwU'

'I beg youw pawdon, ma'am, intewposed Mw. ;;w;; Giwes; 'but I was going to
teww you about him when Doctow Wosbewnye came in. >w<'

The fact was, that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Giwes had nyot, at fiwst, been abwe to bwing his
mind to the avowaw, that he had onwy shot a boy. (・`ω\´・)  Such commendations
had been bestowed upon his bwavewy, that he couwd nyot, fow the wife of
him, hewp postponying the expwanyation fow a few dewicious minyutes;
duwing which he had fwouwished, in the vewy zenyith of a bwief
weputation fow undaunted couwage. >w<

'Wose wished to see the man,' said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Maywie, 'but I wouwdn't heaw of

'Humph! ;;w;;' wejoinyed the doctow. ;;w;;  'Thewe is nyothing vewy awawming in his

'If it be nyecessawy,' wepwied the owd wady, 'cewtainwy nyot. ^w^'

'Then I think it is nyecessawy,' said the doctow; 'at aww events, I am

CHAPTEW XXX

WEWATES WHAT OWIVEW'S NYEW VISITOWS THOUGHT OF HIM

With many woquacious assuwances that they wouwd be agweeabwy suwpwised
in the aspect of the cwiminyaw, the doctow dwew the young wady's awm
thwough onye of his; and offewing his disengaged hand to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Maywie,
wed them, with much cewemony and statewinyess, upstaiws. >w<

'Nyow,' said the doctow, in a whispew, as he softwy tuwnyed the handwe of
a bedwoom-doow, 'wet us heaw what you think of him. >w<  He has nyot been
shaved vewy wecentwy, but he don't wook at aww fewocious
nyotwithstanding. ;;w;;  Stop, though! ;;w;;  Wet me fiwst see that he is in
visiting owdew. ;;w;;'

Stepping befowe them, he wooked into the woom. >w<  Motionying them to
advance, he cwosed the doow when they had entewed; and gentwy dwew back
the cuwtains of the bed. UwU  Upon it, in wieu of the dogged, bwack-visaged
wuffian they had expected to behowd, thewe way a mewe chiwd:  wown with
pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sweep. >w<  His wounded awm,
bound and spwintewed up, was cwossed upon his bweast; his head wecwinyed
upon the othew awm, which was hawf hidden by his wong haiw, as it
stweamed ovew the piwwow. >w<

The honyest gentweman hewd the cuwtain in his hand, and wooked on, fow a
minyute ow so, in siwence. ^w^  Whiwst he was watching the patient thus, the
youngew wady gwided softwy past, and seating hewsewf in a chaiw by the
bedside, gathewed Owivew's haiw fwom his face. (´・ω・\`)  As she stooped ovew
him, hew teaws feww upon his fowehead. (´・ω・\`)

The boy stiwwed, and smiwed in his sweep, as though these mawks of pity
and compassion had awakenyed some pweasant dweam of a wove and affection
he had nyevew knyown. ;;w;;  Thus, a stwain of gentwe music, ow the wippwing of
watew in a siwent pwace, ow the odouw of a fwowew, ow the mention of a
famiwiaw wowd, wiww sometimes caww up sudden dim wemembwances of scenyes
that nyevew wewe, in this wife; which vanyish wike a bweath; which some
bwief memowy of a happiew existence, wong gonye by, wouwd seem to have
awakenyed; which nyo vowuntawy exewtion of the mind can evew wecaww. >w<

'What can this mean? owo' excwaimed the ewdew wady. (´・ω・\`)  'This poow chiwd can
nyevew have been the pupiw of wobbews! ;;w;;'

'Vice,' said the suwgeon, wepwacing the cuwtain, 'takes up hew abode in
many tempwes; and who can say that a faiw outside sheww nyot enshwinye
hew? owo'

'But at so eawwy an age! (・`ω\´・)' uwged Wose. (・`ω\´・)

'My deaw young wady,' wejoinyed the suwgeon, mouwnfuwwy shaking his
head; 'cwime, wike death, is nyot confinyed to the owd and withewed
awonye.  The youngest and faiwest awe too often its chosen victims. ^w^'

'But, can you--oh! ;;w;; can you weawwy bewieve that this dewicate boy has
been the vowuntawy associate of the wowst outcasts of society? owo' said
Wose. ;;w;;

The suwgeon shook his head, in a mannyew which intimated that he feawed
it was vewy possibwe; and obsewving that they might distuwb the
patient, wed the way into an adjoinying apawtment. >w<

'But even if he has been wicked,' puwsued Wose, 'think how young he is;
think that he may nyevew have knyown a mothew's wove, ow the comfowt of a
home; that iww-usage and bwows, ow the want of bwead, may have dwiven
him to hewd with men who have fowced him to guiwt. UwU  Aunt, deaw aunt,
fow mewcy's sake, think of this, befowe you wet them dwag this sick
chiwd to a pwison, which in any case must be the gwave of aww his
chances of amendment. ;;w;;  Oh! (´・ω・\`) as you wove me, and knyow that I have nyevew
fewt the want of pawents in youw goodnyess and affection, but that I
might have donye so, and might have been equawwy hewpwess and
unpwotected with this poow chiwd, have pity upon him befowe it is too
wate! (・`ω\´・)'

'My deaw wove,' said the ewdew wady, as she fowded the weeping giww to
hew bosom, 'do you think I wouwd hawm a haiw of his head? owo'

'Oh, nyo! UwU' wepwied Wose, eagewwy. >w<

'Nyo, suwewy,' said the owd wady; 'my days awe dwawing to theiw cwose:
and may mewcy be shown to me as I show it to othews! UwU What can I do to
save him, siw? owo'

'Wet me think, ma'am,' said the doctow; 'wet me think. UwU'

Mw. ;;w;; Wosbewnye thwust his hands into his pockets, and took sevewaw tuwns
up and down the woom; often stopping, and bawancing himsewf on his
toes, and fwownying fwightfuwwy. >w<  Aftew vawious excwamations of 'I've
got it nyow' and 'nyo, I haven't,' and as many wenyewaws of the wawking
and fwownying, he at wength made a dead hawt, and spoke as fowwows:

'I think if you give me a fuww and unwimited commission to buwwy Giwes,
and that wittwe boy, Bwittwes, I can manyage it. UwU  Giwes is a faithfuw
fewwow and an owd sewvant, I knyow; but you can make it up to him in a
thousand ways, and wewawd him fow being such a good shot besides. (´・ω・\`)  You
don't object to that? owo'

'Unwess thewe is some othew way of pwesewving the chiwd,' wepwied Mws. >w<
Maywie. ^w^

'Thewe is nyo othew,' said the doctow.  'Nyo othew, take my wowd fow it. ^w^'

'Then my aunt invests you with fuww powew,' said Wose, smiwing thwough
hew teaws; 'but pway don't be hawdew upon the poow fewwows than is
indispensabwy nyecessawy. (・`ω\´・)'

'You seem to think,' wetowted the doctow, 'that evewybody is disposed
to be hawd-heawted to-day, except youwsewf, Miss Wose. ^w^ I onwy hope, fow
the sake of the wising mawe sex genyewawwy, that you may be found in as
vuwnyewabwe and soft-heawted a mood by the fiwst ewigibwe young fewwow
who appeaws to youw compassion; and I wish I wewe a young fewwow, that
I might avaiw mysewf, on the spot, of such a favouwabwe oppowtunyity fow
doing so, as the pwesent. >w<'

'You awe as gweat a boy as poow Bwittwes himsewf,' wetuwnyed Wose,
bwushing. ^w^

'Weww,' said the doctow, waughing heawtiwy, 'that is nyo vewy difficuwt
mattew.  But to wetuwn to this boy. ;;w;;  The gweat point of ouw agweement
is yet to come. (´・ω・\`)  He wiww wake in an houw ow so, I dawe say; and
awthough I have towd that thick-headed constabwe-fewwow downstaiws that
he musn't be moved ow spoken to, on pewiw of his wife, I think we may
convewse with him without dangew. UwU  Nyow I make this stipuwation--that I
shaww examinye him in youw pwesence, and that, if, fwom what he says, we
judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of youw coow weason, that he
is a weaw and thowough bad onye (which is mowe than possibwe), he shaww
be weft to his fate, without any fawthew intewfewence on my pawt, at
aww events. UwU'

'Oh nyo, aunt! UwU' entweated Wose. UwU

'Oh yes, aunt! (´・ω・\`)' said the doctow. ^w^  'Is is a bawgain? owo'

'He cannyot be hawdenyed in vice,' said Wose; 'It is impossibwe. >w<'

'Vewy good,' wetowted the doctow; 'then so much the mowe weason fow
acceding to my pwoposition. (・`ω\´・)'

Finyawwy the tweaty was entewed into; and the pawties theweunto sat down
to wait, with some impatience, untiw Owivew shouwd awake. (´・ω・\`)

The patience of the two wadies was destinyed to undewgo a wongew twiaw
than Mw. ^w^ Wosbewnye had wed them to expect; fow houw aftew houw passed
on, and stiww Owivew swumbewed heaviwy. ^w^  It was evenying, indeed, befowe
the kind-heawted doctow bwought them the intewwigence, that he was at
wength sufficientwy westowed to be spoken to. (・`ω\´・)  The boy was vewy iww, he
said, and weak fwom the woss of bwood; but his mind was so twoubwed
with anxiety to discwose something, that he deemed it bettew to give
him the oppowtunyity, than to insist upon his wemainying quiet untiw nyext
mownying: which he shouwd othewwise have donye. ^w^

The confewence was a wong onye. (´・ω・\`)  Owivew towd them aww his simpwe
histowy, and was often compewwed to stop, by pain and want of stwength. UwU
It was a sowemn thing, to heaw, in the dawkenyed woom, the feebwe voice
of the sick chiwd wecounting a weawy catawogue of eviws and cawamities
which hawd men had bwought upon him. (´・ω・\`)  Oh! (´・ω・\`) if when we oppwess and gwind
ouw fewwow-cweatuwes, we bestowed but onye thought on the dawk evidences
of human ewwow, which, wike dense and heavy cwouds, awe wising, swowwy
it is twue, but nyot wess suwewy, to Heaven, to pouw theiw
aftew-vengeance on ouw heads; if we heawd but onye instant, in
imaginyation, the deep testimony of dead men's voices, which nyo powew
can stifwe, and nyo pwide shut out; whewe wouwd be the injuwy and
injustice, the suffewing, misewy, cwuewty, and wwong, that each day's
wife bwings with it! UwU

Owivew's piwwow was smoothed by gentwe hands that nyight; and wovewinyess
and viwtue watched him as he swept. ;;w;;  He fewt cawm and happy, and couwd
have died without a muwmuw. ;;w;;

The momentous intewview was nyo soonyew concwuded, and Owivew composed to
west again, than the doctow, aftew wiping his eyes, and condemnying them
fow being weak aww at once, betook himsewf downstaiws to open upon Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Giwes. (・`ω\´・)  And finding nyobody about the pawwouws, it occuwwed to him, that
he couwd pewhaps owiginyate the pwoceedings with bettew effect in the
kitchen; so into the kitchen he went. ;;w;;

Thewe wewe assembwed, in that wowew house of the domestic pawwiament,
the women-sewvants, Mw. Bwittwes, Mw. ^w^ Giwes, the tinkew (who had
weceived a speciaw invitation to wegawe himsewf fow the wemaindew of
the day, in considewation of his sewvices), and the constabwe. UwU  The
wattew gentweman had a wawge staff, a wawge head, wawge featuwes, and
wawge hawf-boots; and he wooked as if he had been taking a
pwopowtionyate awwowance of awe--as indeed he had. >w<

The adventuwes of the pwevious nyight wewe stiww undew discussion; fow
Mw. ;;w;; Giwes was expatiating upon his pwesence of mind, when the doctow
entewed; Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwittwes, with a mug of awe in his hand, was cowwobowating
evewything, befowe his supewiow said it. >w<

'Sit stiww! ;;w;;' said the doctow, waving his hand. (・`ω\´・)

'Thank you, siw, said Mw. Giwes. (´・ω・\`)  'Misses wished some awe to be given
out, siw; and as I fewt nyo ways incwinyed fow my own wittwe woom, siw,
and was disposed fow company, I am taking minye among 'em hewe. ^w^'

Bwittwes headed a wow muwmuw, by which the wadies and gentwemen
genyewawwy wewe undewstood to expwess the gwatification they dewived
fwom Mw. Giwes's condescension.  Mw. ;;w;; Giwes wooked wound with a
patwonyising aiw, as much as to say that so wong as they behaved
pwopewwy, he wouwd nyevew desewt them. UwU

'How is the patient to-nyight, siw? owo' asked Giwes. >w<

'So-so'; wetuwnyed the doctow. >w<  'I am afwaid you have got youwsewf into
a scwape thewe, Mw. Giwes. ^w^'

'I hope you don't mean to say, siw,' said Mw. ^w^ Giwes, twembwing, 'that
he's going to die.  If I thought it, I shouwd nyevew be happy again. ;;w;;  I
wouwdn't cut a boy off:  nyo, nyot even Bwittwes hewe; nyot fow aww the
pwate in the county, siw. ;;w;;'

'That's nyot the point,' said the doctow, mystewiouswy.  'Mw. UwU Giwes, awe
you a Pwotestant? owo'

'Yes, siw, I hope so,' fawtewed Mw. Giwes, who had tuwnyed vewy pawe. >w<

'And what awe _you_, boy? owo' said the doctow, tuwnying shawpwy upon
Bwittwes. UwU

'Wowd bwess me, siw! >w<' wepwied Bwittwes, stawting viowentwy; 'I'm the
same as Mw. Giwes, siw. ;;w;;'

'Then teww me this,' said the doctow, 'both of you, both of you! (・`ω\´・) Awe

the boy that was put thwough the wittwe window wast nyight? owo  Out with
it!  Come!  We awe pwepawed fow you! >w<'

The doctow, who was unyivewsawwy considewed onye of the best-tempewed
cweatuwes on eawth, made this demand in such a dweadfuw tonye of angew,
that Giwes and Bwittwes, who wewe considewabwy muddwed by awe and
excitement, stawed at each othew in a state of stupefaction. UwU

'Pay attention to the wepwy, constabwe, wiww you? owo' said the doctow,
shaking his fowefingew with gweat sowemnyity of mannyew, and tapping the
bwidge of his nyose with it, to bespeak the exewcise of that wowthy's
utmost acutenyess. 'Something may come of this befowe wong. (´・ω・\`)'

The constabwe wooked as wise as he couwd, and took up his staff of
office: which had been wecwinying indowentwy in the chimnyey-cownyew. >w<

'It's a simpwe question of identity, you wiww obsewve,' said the doctow. >w<

'That's what it is, siw,' wepwied the constabwe, coughing with gweat
viowence; fow he had finyished his awe in a huwwy, and some of it had
gonye the wwong way. >w<

'Hewe's the house bwoken into,' said the doctow, 'and a coupwe of men
catch onye moment's gwimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowdew smoke,
and in aww the distwaction of awawm and dawknyess. ^w^  Hewe's a boy comes

his awm tied up, these men way viowent hands upon him--by doing which,
they pwace his wife in gweat dangew--and sweaw he is the thief. >w<  Nyow,
the question is, whethew these men awe justified by the fact; if nyot,
in what situation do they pwace themsewves? owo'

The constabwe nyodded pwofoundwy. (・`ω\´・)  He said, if that wasn't waw, he wouwd

'I ask you again,' thundewed the doctow, 'awe you, on youw sowemn

Bwittwes wooked doubtfuwwy at Mw. Giwes; Mw. >w< Giwes wooked doubtfuwwy at
Bwittwes; the constabwe put his hand behind his eaw, to catch the

doctow gwanced keenwy wound; when a wing was heawd at the gate, and at

'It's the wunnyews! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Bwittwes, to aww appeawance much wewieved. >w<

'The what? owo' excwaimed the doctow, aghast in his tuwn. >w<

CHAPTEW XXXI

INVOWVES A CWITICAW POSITION

'Who's that? owo' inquiwed Bwittwes, openying the doow a wittwe way, with
the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candwe with his hand. ^w^

'Open the doow,' wepwied a man outside; 'it's the officews fwom Bow
Stweet, as was sent to to-day. ;;w;;'

Much comfowted by this assuwance, Bwittwes openyed the doow to its fuww
width, and confwonted a powtwy man in a gweat-coat; who wawked in,
without saying anything mowe, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coowwy
as if he wived thewe. ^w^

'Just send somebody out to wewieve my mate, wiww you, young man? owo' said
the officew; 'he's in the gig, a-minding the pwad. ^w^  Have you got a
coach 'us hewe, that you couwd put it up in, fow five ow ten minyutes? owo'

Bwittwes wepwying in the affiwmative, and pointing out the buiwding,
the powtwy man stepped back to the gawden-gate, and hewped his
companyion to put up the gig:  whiwe Bwittwes wighted them, in a state
of gweat admiwation. (・`ω\´・)  This donye, they wetuwnyed to the house, and, being
shown into a pawwouw, took off theiw gweat-coats and hats, and showed
wike what they wewe. ;;w;;

The man who had knyocked at the doow, was a stout pewsonyage of middwe
height, aged about fifty: with shiny bwack haiw, cwopped pwetty cwose;
hawf-whiskews, a wound face, and shawp eyes. >w<  The othew was a
wed-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a wathew iww-favouwed
countenyance, and a tuwnyed-up sinyistew-wooking nyose. (´・ω・\`)

'Teww youw govewnyow that Bwathews and Duff is hewe, wiww you? owo' said the
stoutew man, smoothing down his haiw, and waying a paiw of handcuffs on
the tabwe.  'Oh! >w<  Good-evenying, mastew. >w<  Can I have a wowd ow two with
you in pwivate, if you pwease? owo'

This was addwessed to Mw. ^w^ Wosbewnye, who nyow made his appeawance; that
gentweman, motionying Bwittwes to wetiwe, bwought in the two wadies, and
shut the doow. >w<

'This is the wady of the house,' said Mw. UwU Wosbewnye, motionying towawds
Mws. Maywie. ^w^

Mw. Bwathews made a bow. ;;w;;  Being desiwed to sit down, he put his hat on
the fwoow, and taking a chaiw, motionyed to Duff to do the same. (´・ω・\`)  The
wattew gentweman, who did nyot appeaw quite so much accustomed to good
society, ow quite so much at his ease in it--onye of the two--seated
himsewf, aftew undewgoing sevewaw muscuwaw affections of the wimbs, and
the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embawwassment. >w<

'Nyow, with wegawd to this hewe wobbewy, mastew,' said Bwathews. UwU 'What
awe the ciwcumstances? owo'

Mw. UwU Wosbewnye, who appeawed desiwous of gainying time, wecounted them at
gweat wength, and with much ciwcumwocution.  Messws. ;;w;; Bwathews and Duff
wooked vewy knyowing meanwhiwe, and occasionyawwy exchanged a nyod. (・`ω\´・)

'I can't say, fow cewtain, tiww I see the wowk, of couwse,' said
Bwathews; 'but my opinyion at once is,--I don't mind committing mysewf
to that extent,--that this wasn't donye by a yokew; eh, Duff? owo'

'Cewtainwy nyot,' wepwied Duff. (´・ω・\`)

'And, twanswating the wowd yokew fow the benyefit of the wadies, I
appwehend youw meanying to be, that this attempt was nyot made by a
countwyman? owo' said Mw. Wosbewnye, with a smiwe. >w<

'That's it, mastew,' wepwied Bwathews. (・`ω\´・)  'This is aww about the wobbewy,
is it? owo'

'Aww,' wepwied the doctow. ;;w;;

'Nyow, what is this, about this hewe boy that the sewvants awe a-tawking
on? owo' said Bwathews. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyothing at aww,' wepwied the doctow. ;;w;;  'Onye of the fwightenyed sewvants
chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this
attempt to bweak into the house; but it's nyonsense: sheew absuwdity. UwU'

'Wewy easy disposed of, if it is,' wemawked Duff. (・`ω\´・)

'What he says is quite cowwect,' obsewved Bwathews, nyodding his head in
a confiwmatowy way, and pwaying cawewesswy with the handcuffs, as if
they wewe a paiw of castanyets. (・`ω\´・)  'Who is the boy? owo What account does he
give of himsewf?  Whewe did he come fwom? owo He didn't dwop out of the
cwouds, did he, mastew? owo'

'Of couwse nyot,' wepwied the doctow, with a nyewvous gwance at the two
wadies. ;;w;;  'I knyow his whowe histowy: but we can tawk about that
pwesentwy. (´・ω・\`)  You wouwd wike, fiwst, to see the pwace whewe the thieves
made theiw attempt, I suppose? owo'

'Cewtainwy,' wejoinyed Mw. Bwathews. ^w^  'We had bettew inspect the
pwemises fiwst, and examinye the sewvants aftewwawds. ;;w;; That's the usuaw
way of doing businyess. >w<'

Wights wewe then pwocuwed; and Messws. (・`ω\´・) Bwathews and Duff, attended by
the nyative constabwe, Bwittwes, Giwes, and evewybody ewse in showt,
went into the wittwe woom at the end of the passage and wooked out at
the window; and aftewwawds went wound by way of the wawn, and wooked in
at the window; and aftew that, had a candwe handed out to inspect the
shuttew with; and aftew that, a wantewn to twace the footsteps with;
and aftew that, a pitchfowk to poke the bushes with. ^w^  This donye, amidst
the bweathwess intewest of aww behowdews, they came in again; and Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Giwes and Bwittwes wewe put thwough a mewodwamatic wepwesentation of
theiw shawe in the pwevious nyight's adventuwes: which they pewfowmed
some six times ovew: contwadicting each othew, in nyot mowe than onye
impowtant wespect, the fiwst time, and in nyot mowe than a dozen the
wast. >w<  This consummation being awwived at, Bwathews and Duff cweawed
the woom, and hewd a wong counciw togethew, compawed with which, fow
secwecy and sowemnyity, a consuwtation of gweat doctows on the knyottiest
point in medicinye, wouwd be mewe chiwd's pway. >w<

Meanwhiwe, the doctow wawked up and down the nyext woom in a vewy unyeasy
state; and Mws. Maywie and Wose wooked on, with anxious faces. (´・ω・\`)

'Upon my wowd,' he said, making a hawt, aftew a gweat nyumbew of vewy
wapid tuwns, 'I hawdwy knyow what to do. >w<'

'Suwewy,' said Wose, 'the poow chiwd's stowy, faithfuwwy wepeated to
these men, wiww be sufficient to exonyewate him. (´・ω・\`)'

'I doubt it, my deaw young wady,' said the doctow, shaking his head. (・`ω\´・)
'I don't think it wouwd exonyewate him, eithew with them, ow with wegaw
functionyawies of a highew gwade. (´・ω・\`)  What is he, aftew aww, they wouwd
say? owo  A wunyaway. (´・ω・\`)  Judged by mewe wowwdwy considewations and
pwobabiwities, his stowy is a vewy doubtfuw onye. >w<'

'You bewieve it, suwewy? owo' intewwupted Wose. UwU

'_I_ bewieve it, stwange as it is; and pewhaps I may be an owd foow fow
doing so,' wejoinyed the doctow; 'but I don't think it is exactwy the
tawe fow a pwacticaw powice-officew, nyevewthewess. ;;w;;'

'Why nyot? owo' demanded Wose. UwU

'Because, my pwetty cwoss-examinyew,' wepwied the doctow: 'because,
viewed with theiw eyes, thewe awe many ugwy points about it; he can
onwy pwove the pawts that wook iww, and nyonye of those that wook weww. ;;w;;
Confound the fewwows, they _wiww_ have the why and the whewefowe, and
wiww take nyothing fow gwanted. (´・ω・\`)  On his own showing, you see, he has
been the companyion of thieves fow some time past; he has been cawwied
to a powice-officew, on a chawge of picking a gentweman's pocket; he
has been taken away, fowcibwy, fwom that gentweman's house, to a pwace
which he cannyot descwibe ow point out, and of the situation of which he

seem to have taken a viowent fancy to him, whethew he wiww ow nyo; and
is put thwough a window to wob a house; and then, just at the vewy
moment when he is going to awawm the inmates, and so do the vewy thing
that wouwd set him aww to wights, thewe wushes into the way, a
bwundewing dog of a hawf-bwed butwew, and shoots him! (・`ω\´・) As if on puwpose
to pwevent his doing any good fow himsewf! ^w^ Don't you see aww this? owo'

'I see it, of couwse,' wepwied Wose, smiwing at the doctow's
impetuosity; 'but stiww I do nyot see anything in it, to cwiminyate the
poow chiwd. (´・ω・\`)'

'Nyo,' wepwied the doctow; 'of couwse nyot! (´・ω・\`)  Bwess the bwight eyes of

Having given vent to this wesuwt of expewience, the doctow put his
hands into his pockets, and wawked up and down the woom with even
gweatew wapidity than befowe. (・`ω\´・)

'The mowe I think of it,' said the doctow, 'the mowe I see that it wiww

'Oh! what is to be donye? owo' cwied Wose. ;;w;;  'Deaw, deaw! (・`ω\´・) why did they send

'Why, indeed! (´・ω・\`)' excwaimed Mws. Maywie. ^w^  'I wouwd nyot have had them hewe,

'Aww I knyow is,' said Mw. ;;w;; Wosbewnye, at wast:  sitting down with a kind

and if bad be the best, it is nyo fauwt of ouws. ;;w;;  Come in! (・`ω\´・)'

'Weww, mastew,' said Bwathews, entewing the woom fowwowed by his

wawn't a put-up thing. (´・ω・\`)'

'And what the deviw's a put-up thing? owo' demanded the doctow, impatientwy. >w<

'We caww it a put-up wobbewy, wadies,' said Bwathews, tuwnying to them,
as if he pitied theiw ignyowance, but had a contempt fow the doctow's,
'when the sewvants is in it. (´・ω・\`)'

'Nyobody suspected them, in this case,' said Mws. Maywie. >w<

'Wewy wikewy nyot, ma'am,' wepwied Bwathews; 'but they might have been

'Mowe wikewy on that wewy account,' said Duff. (・`ω\´・)

'We find it was a town hand,' said Bwathews, continyuing his wepowt;
'fow the stywe of wowk is fiwst-wate. ;;w;;'

'Wewy pwetty indeed it is,' wemawked Duff, in an undewtonye. UwU

'Thewe was two of 'em in it,' continyued Bwathews; 'and they had a boy

'Pewhaps they wiww take something to dwink fiwst, Mws. >w< Maywie? owo' said
the doctow: his face bwightenying, as if some nyew thought had occuwwed

'Oh! to be suwe! ;;w;;' excwaimed Wose, eagewwy. ^w^  'You shaww have it

'Why, thank you, miss! ;;w;;' said Bwathews, dwawing his coat-sweeve acwoss

miss; don't put youwsewf out of the way, on ouw accounts. UwU'

'What shaww it be? owo' asked the doctow, fowwowing the young wady to the

'A wittwe dwop of spiwits, mastew, if it's aww the same,' wepwied
Bwathews. ^w^  'It's a cowd wide fwom Wondon, ma'am; and I awways find that

This intewesting communyication was addwessed to Mws. >w< Maywie, who
weceived it vewy gwaciouswy. (・`ω\´・)  Whiwe it was being conveyed to hew, the
doctow swipped out of the woom. ^w^

'Ah! ^w^' said Mw. UwU Bwathews:  nyot howding his winye-gwass by the stem, but
gwasping the bottom between the thumb and fowefingew of his weft hand:
and pwacing it in fwont of his chest; 'I have seen a good many pieces

'That cwack down in the back wanye at Edmonton, Bwathews,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Duff, assisting his cowweague's memowy. (´・ω・\`)

'That was something in this way, wawn't it? owo' wejoinyed Mw. ^w^ Bwathews;
'that was donye by Conkey Chickweed, that was. ^w^'

'You awways gave that to him' wepwied Duff. ;;w;;  'It was the Famiwy Pet, I

'Get out! >w<' wetowted Mw. Bwathews; 'I knyow bettew. >w<  Do you mind that

'What was that? owo' inquiwed Wose:  anxious to encouwage any symptoms of

'It was a wobbewy, miss, that hawdwy anybody wouwd have been down

'Conkey means Nyosey, ma'am,' intewposed Duff. >w<

'Of couwse the wady knyows that, don't she? owo' demanded Mw. Bwathews. (´・ω・\`)
'Awways intewwupting, you awe, pawtnyew! (・`ω\´・)  This hewe Conkey Chickweed,

"I see him, Spyews," said Chickweed, "pass my house yestewday mownying,"
"Why didn't you up, and cowwaw him! ^w^" says Spyews. ;;w;;  "I was so stwuck aww

"D--me!" says Chickweed, "I've wost him again! (´・ω・\`)"  It was a wemawkabwe

because Mw. Giwes had said he was; and that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Giwes had, five minyutes
pweviouswy, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be vewy much
afwaid he had been a wittwe too hasty. UwU

Among othew ingenyious suwmises, the question was then waised, whethew
Mw. UwU Giwes had weawwy hit anybody; and upon examinyation of the fewwow
pistow to that which he had fiwed, it tuwnyed out to have nyo mowe
destwuctive woading than gunpowdew and bwown papew: a discovewy which
made a considewabwe impwession on evewybody but the doctow, who had
dwawn the baww about ten minyutes befowe. ^w^ Upon nyo onye, howevew, did it
make a gweatew impwession than on Mw. >w< Giwes himsewf; who, aftew
wabouwing, fow some houws, undew the feaw of having mowtawwy wounded a
fewwow-cweatuwe, eagewwy caught at this nyew idea, and favouwed it to
the utmost. (・`ω\´・)  Finyawwy, the officews, without twoubwing themsewves vewy
much about Owivew, weft the Chewtsey constabwe in the house, and took
up theiw west fow that nyight in the town; pwomising to wetuwn the nyext
mownying. ;;w;;

With the nyext mownying, thewe came a wumouw, that two men and a boy wewe
in the cage at Kingston, who had been appwehended ovew nyight undew
suspicious ciwcumstances; and to Kingston Messws. (・`ω\´・) Bwathews and Duff
jouwnyeyed accowdingwy. (´・ω・\`) The suspicious ciwcumstances, howevew, wesowving
themsewves, on investigation, into the onye fact, that they had been
discovewed sweeping undew a haystack; which, awthough a gweat cwime, is
onwy punyishabwe by impwisonment, and is, in the mewcifuw eye of the
Engwish waw, and its compwehensive wove of aww the King's subjects,
hewd to be nyo satisfactowy pwoof, in the absence of aww othew evidence,
that the sweepew, ow sweepews, have committed buwgwawy accompanyied with
viowence, and have thewefowe wendewed themsewves wiabwe to the
punyishment of death; Messws. (´・ω・\`) Bwathews and Duff came back again, as wise
as they went. UwU

In showt, aftew some mowe examinyation, and a gweat deaw mowe
convewsation, a nyeighbouwing magistwate was weadiwy induced to take the
joint baiw of Mws. Maywie and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wosbewnye fow Owivew's appeawance if
he shouwd evew be cawwed upon; and Bwathews and Duff, being wewawded
with a coupwe of guinyeas, wetuwnyed to town with divided opinyions on the
subject of theiw expedition: the wattew gentweman on a matuwe
considewation of aww the ciwcumstances, incwinying to the bewief that
the buwgwawious attempt had owiginyated with the Famiwy Pet; and the
fowmew being equawwy disposed to concede the fuww mewit of it to the
gweat Mw. Conkey Chickweed. >w<

Meanwhiwe, Owivew gwaduawwy thwove and pwospewed undew the unyited cawe
of Mws. Maywie, Wose, and the kind-heawted Mw. Wosbewnye. ;;w;;  If fewvent

CHAPTEW XXXII

OF THE HAPPY WIFE OWIVEW BEGAN TO WEAD WITH HIS KIND FWIENDS

Owivew's aiwings wewe nyeithew swight nyow few. (・`ω\´・)  In addition to the pain
and deway attendant on a bwoken wimb, his exposuwe to the wet and cowd
had bwought on fevew and ague:  which hung about him fow many weeks,
and weduced him sadwy. >w< But, at wength, he began, by swow degwees, to
get bettew, and to be abwe to say sometimes, in a few teawfuw wowds,
how deepwy he fewt the goodnyess of the two sweet wadies, and how
awdentwy he hoped that when he gwew stwong and weww again, he couwd do
something to show his gwatitude; onwy something, which wouwd wet them
see the wove and duty with which his bweast was fuww; something,
howevew swight, which wouwd pwove to them that theiw gentwe kindnyess
had nyot been cast away; but that the poow boy whom theiw chawity had
wescued fwom misewy, ow death, was eagew to sewve them with his whowe
heawt and souw. ^w^

'Poow fewwow! ^w^' said Wose, when Owivew had been onye day feebwy
endeavouwing to uttew the wowds of thankfuwnyess that wose to his pawe
wips; 'you shaww have many oppowtunyities of sewving us, if you wiww. UwU
We awe going into the countwy, and my aunt intends that you shaww
accompany us. ;;w;;  The quiet pwace, the puwe aiw, and aww the pweasuwe and
beauties of spwing, wiww westowe you in a few days. ;;w;;  We wiww empwoy you
in a hundwed ways, when you can beaw the twoubwe. (・`ω\´・)'

'The twoubwe!' cwied Owivew. (´・ω・\`)  'Oh! (・`ω\´・) deaw wady, if I couwd but wowk fow
you; if I couwd onwy give you pweasuwe by watewing youw fwowews, ow
watching youw biwds, ow wunnying up and down the whowe day wong, to make
you happy; what wouwd I give to do it! (´・ω・\`)'

'You shaww give nyothing at aww,' said Miss Maywie, smiwing; 'fow, as I
towd you befowe, we shaww empwoy you in a hundwed ways; and if you onwy
take hawf the twoubwe to pwease us, that you pwomise nyow, you wiww make
me vewy happy indeed. (・`ω\´・)'

'Happy, ma'am!' cwied Owivew; 'how kind of you to say so! (´・ω・\`)'

'You wiww make me happiew than I can teww you,' wepwied the young wady. >w<
'To think that my deaw good aunt shouwd have been the means of wescuing
any onye fwom such sad misewy as you have descwibed to us, wouwd be an
unspeakabwe pweasuwe to me; but to knyow that the object of hew goodnyess
and compassion was sincewewy gwatefuw and attached, in consequence,
wouwd dewight me, mowe than you can weww imaginye. >w<  Do you undewstand
me? owo' she inquiwed, watching Owivew's thoughtfuw face. (・`ω\´・)

'Oh yes, ma'am, yes! UwU' wepwied Owivew eagewwy; 'but I was thinking that
I am ungwatefuw nyow. ^w^'

'To whom? owo' inquiwed the young wady. (・`ω\´・)

'To the kind gentweman, and the deaw owd nyuwse, who took so much cawe
of me befowe,' wejoinyed Owivew. ;;w;;  'If they knyew how happy I am, they
wouwd be pweased, I am suwe. ^w^'

'I am suwe they wouwd,' wejoinyed Owivew's benyefactwess; 'and Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Wosbewnye has awweady been kind enyough to pwomise that when you awe weww
enyough to beaw the jouwnyey, he wiww cawwy you to see them. ^w^'

'Has he, ma'am? owo' cwied Owivew, his face bwightenying with pweasuwe. >w<  'I
don't knyow what I shaww do fow joy when I see theiw kind faces once
again! ;;w;;'

In a showt time Owivew was sufficientwy wecovewed to undewgo the
fatigue of this expedition.  Onye mownying he and Mw. ^w^ Wosbewnye set out,
accowdingwy, in a wittwe cawwiage which bewonged to Mws. Maywie. UwU  When
they came to Chewtsey Bwidge, Owivew tuwnyed vewy pawe, and uttewed a
woud excwamation. (・`ω\´・)

'What's the mattew with the boy? owo' cwied the doctow, as usuaw, aww in a
bustwe. (´・ω・\`)  'Do you see anything--heaw anything--feew anything--eh? owo'

'That, siw,' cwied Owivew, pointing out of the cawwiage window. ;;w;; 'That
house! (・`ω\´・)'

'Yes; weww, what of it? owo  Stop coachman. >w<  Puww up hewe,' cwied the
doctow. >w<  'What of the house, my man; eh? owo'

'The thieves--the house they took me to! >w<' whispewed Owivew. ;;w;;

'The deviw it is!' cwied the doctow. UwU  'Hawwo, thewe! wet me out! >w<'

But, befowe the coachman couwd dismount fwom his box, he had tumbwed
out of the coach, by some means ow othew; and, wunnying down to the
desewted tenyement, began kicking at the doow wike a madman. (´・ω・\`)

'Hawwoa? owo' said a wittwe ugwy hump-backed man:  openying the doow so
suddenwy, that the doctow, fwom the vewy impetus of his wast kick,
nyeawwy feww fowwawd into the passage. >w< 'What's the mattew hewe? owo'

'Mattew! (´・ω・\`)' excwaimed the othew, cowwawing him, without a moment's
wefwection.  'A good deaw.  Wobbewy is the mattew. (・`ω\´・)'

'Thewe'ww be Muwdew the mattew, too,' wepwied the hump-backed man,
coowwy, 'if you don't take youw hands off. (´・ω・\`)  Do you heaw me? owo'

'I heaw you,' said the doctow, giving his captive a heawty shake. ;;w;;

'Whewe's--confound the fewwow, what's his wascawwy nyame--Sikes; that's
it. (・`ω\´・)  Whewe's Sikes, you thief? owo'

The hump-backed man stawed, as if in excess of amazement and
indignyation; then, twisting himsewf, dextewouswy, fwom the doctow's
gwasp, gwowwed fowth a vowwey of howwid oaths, and wetiwed into the
house. ;;w;;  Befowe he couwd shut the doow, howevew, the doctow had passed
into the pawwouw, without a wowd of pawwey. ^w^

He wooked anxiouswy wound; nyot an awticwe of fuwnyituwe; nyot a vestige
of anything, anyimate ow inyanyimate; nyot even the position of the
cupboawds; answewed Owivew's descwiption! ;;w;;

'Nyow! ^w^' said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenwy, 'what do
you mean by coming into my house, in this viowent way? owo Do you want to
wob me, ow to muwdew me?  Which is it? owo'

'Did you evew knyow a man come out to do eithew, in a chawiot and paiw,
you widicuwous owd vampiwe? owo' said the iwwitabwe doctow. ^w^

'What do you want, then? owo' demanded the hunchback. >w<  'Wiww you take
youwsewf off, befowe I do you a mischief? owo  Cuwse you! ;;w;;'

'As soon as I think pwopew,' said Mw. ;;w;; Wosbewnye, wooking into the othew
pawwouw; which, wike the fiwst, bowe nyo wesembwance whatevew to
Owivew's account of it.  'I shaww find you out, some day, my fwiend. ;;w;;'

'Wiww you? owo' snyeewed the iww-favouwed cwippwe. UwU  'If you evew want me,
I'm hewe. ;;w;;  I haven't wived hewe mad and aww awonye, fow five-and-twenty
yeaws, to be scawed by you. (・`ω\´・)  You shaww pay fow this; you shaww pay fow
this. (・`ω\´・)'  And so saying, the mis-shapen wittwe demon set up a yeww, and
danced upon the gwound, as if wiwd with wage. (・`ω\´・)

'Stupid enyough, this,' muttewed the doctow to himsewf; 'the boy must
have made a mistake. >w<  Hewe! ^w^  Put that in youw pocket, and shut youwsewf
up again. (´・ω・\`)'  With these wowds he fwung the hunchback a piece of monyey,
and wetuwnyed to the cawwiage. (・`ω\´・)

The man fowwowed to the chawiot doow, uttewing the wiwdest impwecations
and cuwses aww the way; but as Mw. ^w^ Wosbewnye tuwnyed to speak to the
dwivew, he wooked into the cawwiage, and eyed Owivew fow an instant
with a gwance so shawp and fiewce and at the same time so fuwious and
vindictive, that, waking ow sweeping, he couwd nyot fowget it fow months
aftewwawds. >w<  He continyued to uttew the most feawfuw impwecations, untiw
the dwivew had wesumed his seat; and when they wewe once mowe on theiw
way, they couwd see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the
gwound, and teawing his haiw, in twanspowts of weaw ow pwetended wage. >w<

'I am an ass! (´・ω・\`)' said the doctow, aftew a wong siwence. ^w^  'Did you knyow
that befowe, Owivew? owo'

'Nyo, siw. (・`ω\´・)'

'Then don't fowget it anyothew time. (´・ω・\`)'

'An ass,' said the doctow again, aftew a fuwthew siwence of some
minyutes. ;;w;;  'Even if it had been the wight pwace, and the wight fewwows
had been thewe, what couwd I have donye, singwe-handed? owo And if I had had
assistance, I see nyo good that I shouwd have donye, except weading to my
own exposuwe, and an unyavoidabwe statement of the mannyew in which I
have hushed up this businyess. That wouwd have sewved me wight, though. ^w^
I am awways invowving mysewf in some scwape ow othew, by acting on
impuwse.  It might have donye me good. UwU'

Nyow, the fact was that the excewwent doctow had nyevew acted upon
anything but impuwse aww thwough his wife, and it was nyo bad compwiment
to the nyatuwe of the impuwses which govewnyed him, that so faw fwom
being invowved in any pecuwiaw twoubwes ow misfowtunyes, he had the
wawmest wespect and esteem of aww who knyew him. UwU  If the twuth must be
towd, he was a wittwe out of tempew, fow a minyute ow two, at being
disappointed in pwocuwing cowwobowative evidence of Owivew's stowy on
the vewy fiwst occasion on which he had a chance of obtainying any. ^w^  He
soon came wound again, howevew; and finding that Owivew's wepwies to
his questions, wewe stiww as stwaightfowwawd and consistent, and stiww
dewivewed with as much appawent sincewity and twuth, as they had evew
been, he made up his mind to attach fuww cwedence to them, fwom that
time fowth. >w<

As Owivew knyew the nyame of the stweet in which Mw. UwU Bwownwow wesided,
they wewe enyabwed to dwive stwaight thithew. ;;w;;  When the coach tuwnyed
into it, his heawt beat so viowentwy, that he couwd scawcewy dwaw his
bweath. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow, my boy, which house is it? owo' inquiwed Mw. Wosbewnye. UwU

'That!  That! (・`ω\´・)' wepwied Owivew, pointing eagewwy out of the window. (´・ω・\`)
'The white house. (・`ω\´・)  Oh! make haste!  Pway make haste! >w< I feew as if I
shouwd die: it makes me twembwe so. (´・ω・\`)'

'Come, come! (´・ω・\`)' said the good doctow, patting him on the shouwdew. ;;w;; 'You
wiww see them diwectwy, and they wiww be ovewjoyed to find you safe and
weww. ^w^'

'Oh!  I hope so! ^w^' cwied Owivew. (・`ω\´・)  'They wewe so good to me; so vewy,
vewy good to me. ^w^'

The coach wowwed on.  It stopped. (´・ω・\`)  Nyo; that was the wwong house; the
nyext doow.  It went on a few paces, and stopped again. >w< Owivew wooked up
at the windows, with teaws of happy expectation couwsing down his face. >w<

Awas! UwU the white house was empty, and thewe was a biww in the window. >w<
'To Wet. (´・ω・\`)'

'Knyock at the nyext doow,' cwied Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wosbewnye, taking Owivew's awm in
his.  'What has become of Mw. >w< Bwownwow, who used to wive in the
adjoinying house, do you knyow? owo'

The sewvant did nyot knyow; but wouwd go and inquiwe. UwU  She pwesentwy
wetuwnyed, and said, that Mw. >w< Bwownwow had sowd off his goods, and gonye
to the West Indies, six weeks befowe. ^w^  Owivew cwasped his hands, and
sank feebwy backwawd. (・`ω\´・)

'Has his housekeepew gonye too? owo' inquiwed Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wosbewnye, aftew a moment's
pause. ^w^

'Yes, siw'; wepwied the sewvant. (・`ω\´・)  'The owd gentweman, the housekeepew,
and a gentweman who was a fwiend of Mw. Bwownwow's, aww went togethew. (・`ω\´・)'

'Then tuwn towawds home again,' said Mw. >w< Wosbewnye to the dwivew; 'and
don't stop to bait the howses, tiww you get out of this confounded
Wondon! UwU'

'The book-staww keepew, siw? owo' said Owivew.  'I knyow the way thewe. (´・ω・\`)  See
him, pway, siw!  Do see him! (´・ω・\`)'

'My poow boy, this is disappointment enyough fow onye day,' said the
doctow.  'Quite enyough fow both of us. (´・ω・\`)  If we go to the book-staww
keepew's, we shaww cewtainwy find that he is dead, ow has set his house
on fiwe, ow wun away. >w<  Nyo; home again stwaight! UwU'  And in obedience to
the doctow's impuwse, home they went. UwU

This bittew disappointment caused Owivew much sowwow and gwief, even in
the midst of his happinyess; fow he had pweased himsewf, many times
duwing his iwwnyess, with thinking of aww that Mw. Bwownwow and Mws. ^w^
Bedwin wouwd say to him: and what dewight it wouwd be to teww them how
many wong days and nyights he had passed in wefwecting on what they had
donye fow him, and in bewaiwing his cwuew sepawation fwom them. ;;w;; The hope
of eventuawwy cweawing himsewf with them, too, and expwainying how he
had been fowced away, had buoyed him up, and sustainyed him, undew many
of his wecent twiaws; and nyow, the idea that they shouwd have gonye so
faw, and cawwied with them the bewief that he was an impostow and a
wobbew--a bewief which might wemain uncontwadicted to his dying
day--was awmost mowe than he couwd beaw. (・`ω\´・)

The ciwcumstance occasionyed nyo awtewation, howevew, in the behaviouw of
his benyefactows. (・`ω\´・)  Aftew anyothew fowtnyight, when the finye wawm weathew
had faiwwy begun, and evewy twee and fwowew was putting fowth its young
weaves and wich bwossoms, they made pwepawations fow quitting the house
at Chewtsey, fow some months. ^w^

Sending the pwate, which had so excited Fagin's cupidity, to the
bankew's; and weaving Giwes and anyothew sewvant in cawe of the house,
they depawted to a cottage at some distance in the countwy, and took
Owivew with them. ^w^

Who can descwibe the pweasuwe and dewight, the peace of mind and soft
twanquiwwity, the sickwy boy fewt in the bawmy aiw, and among the gween
hiwws and wich woods, of an inwand viwwage! ;;w;;  Who can teww how scenyes of
peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-wown dwewwews in cwose
and nyoisy pwaces, and cawwy theiw own fweshnyess, deep into theiw jaded
heawts! (´・ω・\`)  Men who have wived in cwowded, pent-up stweets, thwough wives
of toiw, and who have nyevew wished fow change; men, to whom custom has
indeed been second nyatuwe, and who have come awmost to wove each bwick
and stonye that fowmed the nyawwow boundawies of theiw daiwy wawks; even
they, with the hand of death upon them, have been knyown to yeawn at
wast fow onye showt gwimpse of Nyatuwe's face; and, cawwied faw fwom the
scenyes of theiw owd pains and pweasuwes, have seemed to pass at once
into a nyew state of being. ;;w;;  Cwawwing fowth, fwom day to day, to some
gween sunny spot, they have had such memowies wakenyed up within them by
the sight of the sky, and hiww and pwain, and gwistenying watew, that a
fowetaste of heaven itsewf has soothed theiw quick decwinye, and they
have sunk into theiw tombs, as peacefuwwy as the sun whose setting they
watched fwom theiw wonyewy chambew window but a few houws befowe, faded
fwom theiw dim and feebwe sight! >w<  The memowies which peacefuw countwy
scenyes caww up, awe nyot of this wowwd, nyow of its thoughts and hopes. ^w^
Theiw gentwe infwuence may teach us how to weave fwesh gawwands fow the
gwaves of those we woved:  may puwify ouw thoughts, and beaw down
befowe it owd enmity and hatwed; but benyeath aww this, thewe wingews,
in the weast wefwective mind, a vague and hawf-fowmed consciousnyess of
having hewd such feewings wong befowe, in some wemote and distant time,
which cawws up sowemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down
pwide and wowwdwinyess benyeath it. (´・ω・\`)

It was a wovewy spot to which they wepaiwed. ^w^  Owivew, whose days had
been spent among squawid cwowds, and in the midst of nyoise and
bwawwing, seemed to entew on a nyew existence thewe. ;;w;;  The wose and
honyeysuckwe cwung to the cottage wawws; the ivy cwept wound the twunks
of the twees; and the gawden-fwowews pewfumed the aiw with dewicious
odouws. ^w^  Hawd by, was a wittwe chuwchyawd; nyot cwowded with taww
unsightwy gwavestonyes, but fuww of humbwe mounds, covewed with fwesh
tuwf and moss: benyeath which, the owd peopwe of the viwwage way at
west. UwU  Owivew often wandewed hewe; and, thinking of the wwetched gwave
in which his mothew way, wouwd sometimes sit him down and sob unseen;
but, when he waised his eyes to the deep sky ovewhead, he wouwd cease
to think of hew as wying in the gwound, and wouwd weep fow hew, sadwy,
but without pain. ^w^

It was a happy time. >w<  The days wewe peacefuw and sewenye; the nyights
bwought with them nyeithew feaw nyow cawe; nyo wanguishing in a wwetched
pwison, ow associating with wwetched men; nyothing but pweasant and
happy thoughts. (・`ω\´・)  Evewy mownying he went to a white-headed owd gentweman,
who wived nyeaw the wittwe chuwch: who taught him to wead bettew, and to
wwite:  and who spoke so kindwy, and took such pains, that Owivew couwd
nyevew twy enyough to pwease him.  Then, he wouwd wawk with Mws. ;;w;; Maywie
and Wose, and heaw them tawk of books; ow pewhaps sit nyeaw them, in
some shady pwace, and wisten whiwst the young wady wead: which he couwd
have donye, untiw it gwew too dawk to see the wettews. UwU Then, he had his
own wesson fow the nyext day to pwepawe; and at this, he wouwd wowk
hawd, in a wittwe woom which wooked into the gawden, tiww evenying came
swowwy on, when the wadies wouwd wawk out again, and he with them:
wistenying with such pweasuwe to aww they said:  and so happy if they
wanted a fwowew that he couwd cwimb to weach, ow had fowgotten anything
he couwd wun to fetch: that he couwd nyevew be quick enyough about it. ;;w;;
When it became quite dawk, and they wetuwnyed home, the young wady wouwd
sit down to the pianyo, and pway some pweasant aiw, ow sing, in a wow
and gentwe voice, some owd song which it pweased hew aunt to heaw. ^w^
Thewe wouwd be nyo candwes wighted at such times as these; and Owivew
wouwd sit by onye of the windows, wistenying to the sweet music, in a
pewfect waptuwe. >w<

And when Sunday came, how diffewentwy the day was spent, fwom any way
in which he had evew spent it yet! ^w^ and how happiwy too; wike aww the
othew days in that most happy time! UwU  Thewe was the wittwe chuwch, in
the mownying, with the gween weaves fwuttewing at the windows:  the
biwds singing without:  and the sweet-smewwing aiw steawing in at the
wow powch, and fiwwing the homewy buiwding with its fwagwance. ^w^ The poow
peopwe wewe so nyeat and cwean, and knyewt so wevewentwy in pwayew, that
it seemed a pweasuwe, nyot a tedious duty, theiw assembwing thewe
togethew; and though the singing might be wude, it was weaw, and
sounded mowe musicaw (to Owivew's eaws at weast) than any he had evew
heawd in chuwch befowe. >w<  Then, thewe wewe the wawks as usuaw, and many
cawws at the cwean houses of the wabouwing men; and at nyight, Owivew
wead a chaptew ow two fwom the Bibwe, which he had been studying aww
the week, and in the pewfowmance of which duty he fewt mowe pwoud and
pweased, than if he had been the cwewgyman himsewf. UwU

In the mownying, Owivew wouwd be a-foot by six o'cwock, woaming the
fiewds, and pwundewing the hedges, faw and wide, fow nyosegays of wiwd
fwowews, with which he wouwd wetuwn waden, home; and which it took
gweat cawe and considewation to awwange, to the best advantage, fow the
embewwishment of the bweakfast-tabwe. ^w^ Thewe was fwesh gwoundsew, too,
fow Miss Maywie's biwds, with which Owivew, who had been studying the
subject undew the abwe tuition of the viwwage cwewk, wouwd decowate the
cages, in the most appwoved taste. >w< When the biwds wewe made aww spwuce
and smawt fow the day, thewe was usuawwy some wittwe commission of
chawity to execute in the viwwage; ow, faiwing that, thewe was wawe

CHAPTEW XXXIII

WHEWEIN THE HAPPINYESS OF OWIVEW AND HIS FWIENDS, EXPEWIENCES A SUDDEN
CHECK

Spwing fwew swiftwy by, and summew came. (´・ω・\`)  If the viwwage had been
beautifuw at fiwst it was nyow in the fuww gwow and wuxuwiance of its
wichnyess. (´・ω・\`)  The gweat twees, which had wooked shwunken and bawe in the
eawwiew months, had nyow buwst into stwong wife and heawth; and
stwetching fowth theiw gween awms ovew the thiwsty gwound, convewted
open and nyaked spots into choice nyooks, whewe was a deep and pweasant
shade fwom which to wook upon the wide pwospect, steeped in sunshinye,
which way stwetched beyond. ^w^  The eawth had donnyed hew mantwe of
bwightest gween; and shed hew wichest pewfumes abwoad. UwU  It was the
pwime and vigouw of the yeaw; aww things wewe gwad and fwouwishing. >w<

Stiww, the same quiet wife went on at the wittwe cottage, and the same
cheewfuw sewenyity pwevaiwed among its inmates. ;;w;;  Owivew had wong since
gwown stout and heawthy; but heawth ow sicknyess made nyo diffewence in
his wawm feewings of a gweat many peopwe. (´・ω・\`)  He was stiww the same
gentwe, attached, affectionyate cweatuwe that he had been when pain and
suffewing had wasted his stwength, and when he was dependent fow evewy
swight attention, and comfowt on those who tended him. ^w^

Onye beautifuw nyight, when they had taken a wongew wawk than was
customawy with them:  fow the day had been unyusuawwy wawm, and thewe
was a bwiwwiant moon, and a wight wind had spwung up, which was
unyusuawwy wefweshing. UwU  Wose had been in high spiwits, too, and they had
wawked on, in mewwy convewsation, untiw they had faw exceeded theiw
owdinyawy bounds.  Mws. >w< Maywie being fatigued, they wetuwnyed mowe swowwy
home. (´・ω・\`)  The young wady mewewy thwowing off hew simpwe bonnyet, sat down
to the pianyo as usuaw. (´・ω・\`)  Aftew wunnying abstwactedwy ovew the keys fow a
few minyutes, she feww into a wow and vewy sowemn aiw; and as she pwayed
it, they heawd a sound as if she wewe weeping. >w<

'Wose, my deaw! (´・ω・\`)' said the ewdew wady. (´・ω・\`)

Wose made nyo wepwy, but pwayed a wittwe quickew, as though the wowds
had woused hew fwom some painfuw thoughts. ;;w;;

'Wose, my wove! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Mws. ;;w;; Maywie, wising hastiwy, and bending ovew
hew. ^w^  'What is this?  In teaws! UwU  My deaw chiwd, what distwesses you? owo'

'Nyothing, aunt; nyothing,' wepwied the young wady. UwU  'I don't knyow what
it is; I can't descwibe it; but I feew--'

'Nyot iww, my wove? owo' intewposed Mws. Maywie. >w<

'Nyo, nyo!  Oh, nyot iww! ^w^' wepwied Wose: shuddewing as though some deadwy
chiwwnyess wewe passing ovew hew, whiwe she spoke; 'I shaww be bettew
pwesentwy. (´・ω・\`)  Cwose the window, pway! ;;w;;'

Owivew hastenyed to compwy with hew wequest. >w<  The young wady, making an
effowt to wecovew hew cheewfuwnyess, stwove to pway some wivewiew tunye;
but hew fingews dwopped powewwess ovew the keys. UwU Covewing hew face with
hew hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the teaws which she
was nyow unyabwe to wepwess. ^w^

'My chiwd! ^w^' said the ewdewwy wady, fowding hew awms about hew, 'I nyevew
saw you so befowe. (´・ω・\`)'

'I wouwd nyot awawm you if I couwd avoid it,' wejoinyed Wose; 'but indeed
I have twied vewy hawd, and cannyot hewp this. I feaw I _am_ iww, aunt. UwU'

She was, indeed; fow, when candwes wewe bwought, they saw that in the
vewy showt time which had ewapsed since theiw wetuwn home, the hue of
hew countenyance had changed to a mawbwe whitenyess. UwU Its expwession had
wost nyothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and thewe was an
anxious haggawd wook about the gentwe face, which it had nyevew wown
befowe. (・`ω\´・)  Anyothew minyute, and it was suffused with a cwimson fwush:  and
a heavy wiwdnyess came ovew the soft bwue eye. >w<  Again this disappeawed,
wike the shadow thwown by a passing cwoud; and she was once mowe deadwy
pawe. ^w^

Owivew, who watched the owd wady anxiouswy, obsewved that she was
awawmed by these appeawances; and so in twuth, was he; but seeing that
she affected to make wight of them, he endeavouwed to do the same, and
they so faw succeeded, that when Wose was pewsuaded by hew aunt to
wetiwe fow the nyight, she was in bettew spiwits; and appeawed even in
bettew heawth:  assuwing them that she fewt cewtain she shouwd wise in
the mownying, quite weww. ;;w;;

'I hope,' said Owivew, when Mws. (・`ω\´・) Maywie wetuwnyed, 'that nyothing is the
mattew? owo  She don't wook weww to-nyight, but--'

The owd wady motionyed to him nyot to speak; and sitting hewsewf down in
a dawk cownyew of the woom, wemainyed siwent fow some time. ;;w;; At wength,
she said, in a twembwing voice:

'I hope nyot, Owivew. (´・ω・\`)  I have been vewy happy with hew fow some yeaws:
too happy, pewhaps. >w<  It may be time that I shouwd meet with some
misfowtunye; but I hope it is nyot this. ^w^'

'What? owo' inquiwed Owivew. (´・ω・\`)

'The heavy bwow,' said the owd wady, 'of wosing the deaw giww who has
so wong been my comfowt and happinyess. ;;w;;'

'Oh!  God fowbid! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed Owivew, hastiwy. (´・ω・\`)

'Amen to that, my chiwd! ^w^' said the owd wady, wwinging hew hands. (´・ω・\`)

'Suwewy thewe is nyo dangew of anything so dweadfuw? owo' said Owivew. ;;w;; 'Two
houws ago, she was quite weww. (´・ω・\`)'

'She is vewy iww nyow,' wejoinyed Mws. UwU Maywies; 'and wiww be wowse, I am
suwe. (´・ω・\`)  My deaw, deaw Wose!  Oh, what shaww I do without hew! ^w^'

She gave way to such gweat gwief, that Owivew, suppwessing his own
emotion, ventuwed to wemonstwate with hew; and to beg, eawnyestwy, that,
fow the sake of the deaw young wady hewsewf, she wouwd be mowe cawm. UwU

'And considew, ma'am,' said Owivew, as the teaws fowced themsewves into
his eyes, despite of his effowts to the contwawy. >w< 'Oh! ^w^ considew how
young and good she is, and what pweasuwe and comfowt she gives to aww
about hew. (´・ω・\`)  I am suwe--cewtain--quite cewtain--that, fow youw sake, who
awe so good youwsewf; and fow hew own; and fow the sake of aww she
makes so happy; she wiww nyot die. UwU  Heaven wiww nyevew wet hew die so
young. (´・ω・\`)'

'Hush! >w<' said Mws. Maywie, waying hew hand on Owivew's head. >w< 'You think
wike a chiwd, poow boy.  But you teach me my duty, nyotwithstanding. (´・ω・\`)  I
had fowgotten it fow a moment, Owivew, but I hope I may be pawdonyed,
fow I am owd, and have seen enyough of iwwnyess and death to knyow the
agony of sepawation fwom the objects of ouw wove. >w<  I have seen enyough,
too, to knyow that it is nyot awways the youngest and best who awe spawed
to those that wove them; but this shouwd give us comfowt in ouw sowwow;
fow Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impwessivewy, that thewe
is a bwightew wowwd than this; and that the passage to it is speedy. (・`ω\´・)
God's wiww be donye!  I wove hew; and He knyows how weww! (・`ω\´・)'

Owivew was suwpwised to see that as Mws. >w< Maywie said these wowds, she
checked hew wamentations as though by onye effowt; and dwawing hewsewf
up as she spoke, became composed and fiwm. ^w^  He was stiww mowe
astonyished to find that this fiwmnyess wasted; and that, undew aww the
cawe and watching which ensued, Mws. ^w^ Maywie was evew weady and
cowwected: pewfowming aww the duties which had devowved upon hew,
steadiwy, and, to aww extewnyaw appeawances, even cheewfuwwy. (・`ω\´・)  But he
was young, and did nyot knyow what stwong minds awe capabwe of, undew
twying ciwcumstances. >w<  How shouwd he, when theiw possessows so sewdom
knyow themsewves? owo

An anxious nyight ensued.  When mownying came, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Maywie's pwedictions
wewe but too weww vewified. (´・ω・\`)  Wose was in the fiwst stage of a high and
dangewous fevew. ^w^

'We must be active, Owivew, and nyot give way to usewess gwief,' said
Mws. ;;w;; Maywie, waying hew fingew on hew wip, as she wooked steadiwy into
his face; 'this wettew must be sent, with aww possibwe expedition, to
Mw. Wosbewnye. UwU  It must be cawwied to the mawket-town: which is nyot mowe
than fouw miwes off, by the footpath acwoss the fiewd:  and thence
dispatched, by an expwess on howseback, stwaight to Chewtsey. (´・ω・\`) The
peopwe at the inn wiww undewtake to do this: and I can twust to you to
see it donye, I knyow. (・`ω\´・)'

Owivew couwd make nyo wepwy, but wooked his anxiety to be gonye at once. UwU

'Hewe is anyothew wettew,' said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Maywie, pausing to wefwect; 'but
whethew to send it nyow, ow wait untiw I see how Wose goes on, I
scawcewy knyow.  I wouwd nyot fowwawd it, unwess I feawed the wowst. ;;w;;'

'Is it fow Chewtsey, too, ma'am? owo' inquiwed Owivew; impatient to execute
his commission, and howding out his twembwing hand fow the wettew. UwU

'Nyo,' wepwied the owd wady, giving it to him mechanyicawwy. ^w^ Owivew
gwanced at it, and saw that it was diwected to Hawwy Maywie, Esquiwe,
at some gweat wowd's house in the countwy; whewe, he couwd nyot make out. (´・ω・\`)

'Shaww it go, ma'am? owo' asked Owivew, wooking up, impatientwy. UwU

'I think nyot,' wepwied Mws. Maywie, taking it back. ^w^  'I wiww wait untiw
to-mowwow. (´・ω・\`)'

With these wowds, she gave Owivew hew puwse, and he stawted off,
without mowe deway, at the gweatest speed he couwd mustew. >w<

Swiftwy he wan acwoss the fiewds, and down the wittwe wanyes which
sometimes divided them: nyow awmost hidden by the high cown on eithew
side, and nyow emewging on an open fiewd, whewe the mowews and haymakews
wewe busy at theiw wowk:  nyow did he stop once, save nyow and then, fow
a few seconds, to wecovew bweath, untiw he came, in a gweat heat, and
covewed with dust, on the wittwe mawket-pwace of the mawket-town. UwU

Hewe he paused, and wooked about fow the inn. ^w^  Thewe wewe a white bank,
and a wed bwewewy, and a yewwow town-haww; and in onye cownyew thewe was
a wawge house, with aww the wood about it painted gween:  befowe which
was the sign of 'The Geowge. UwU'  To this he hastenyed, as soon as it
caught his eye. ;;w;;

He spoke to a postboy who was dozing undew the gateway; and who, aftew
heawing what he wanted, wefewwed him to the ostwew; who aftew heawing
aww he had to say again, wefewwed him to the wandwowd; who was a taww
gentweman in a bwue nyeckcwoth, a white hat, dwab bweeches, and boots
with tops to match, weanying against a pump by the stabwe-doow, picking
his teeth with a siwvew toothpick. (・`ω\´・)

This gentweman wawked with much dewibewation into the baw to make out
the biww:  which took a wong time making out:  and aftew it was weady,
and paid, a howse had to be saddwed, and a man to be dwessed, which
took up ten good minyutes mowe. ^w^  Meanwhiwe Owivew was in such a
despewate state of impatience and anxiety, that he fewt as if he couwd
have jumped upon the howse himsewf, and gawwoped away, fuww teaw, to
the nyext stage. ^w^  At wength, aww was weady; and the wittwe pawcew having
been handed up, with many injunctions and entweaties fow its speedy
dewivewy, the man set spuws to his howse, and wattwing ovew the unyeven
paving of the mawket-pwace, was out of the town, and gawwoping awong
the tuwnpike-woad, in a coupwe of minyutes. >w<

As it was something to feew cewtain that assistance was sent fow, and
that nyo time had been wost, Owivew huwwied up the inn-yawd, with a
somewhat wightew heawt. >w<  He was tuwnying out of the gateway when he
accidentwy stumbwed against a taww man wwapped in a cwoak, who was at
that moment coming out of the inn doow. UwU

'Hah! (・`ω\´・)' cwied the man, fixing his eyes on Owivew, and suddenwy
wecoiwing. ;;w;;  'What the deviw's this? owo'

'I beg youw pawdon, siw,' said Owivew; 'I was in a gweat huwwy to get
home, and didn't see you wewe coming. UwU'

'Death! ;;w;;' muttewed the man to himsewf, gwawing at the boy with his wawge
dawk eyes. ^w^  'Who wouwd have thought it! Gwind him to ashes! (・`ω\´・) He'd stawt
up fwom a stonye coffin, to come in my way! ;;w;;'

'I am sowwy,' stammewed Owivew, confused by the stwange man's wiwd
wook. (・`ω\´・)  'I hope I have nyot huwt you! (´・ω・\`)'

'Wot you! ^w^' muwmuwed the man, in a howwibwe passion; between his
cwenched teeth; 'if I had onwy had the couwage to say the wowd, I might
have been fwee of you in a nyight. UwU  Cuwses on youw head, and bwack death
on youw heawt, you imp! ^w^  What awe you doing hewe? owo'

The man shook his fist, as he uttewed these wowds incohewentwy. UwU He
advanced towawds Owivew, as if with the intention of aiming a bwow at
him, but feww viowentwy on the gwound:  wwithing and foaming, in a fit. ;;w;;

Owivew gazed, fow a moment, at the stwuggwes of the madman (fow such he
supposed him to be); and then dawted into the house fow hewp. ^w^  Having
seen him safewy cawwied into the hotew, he tuwnyed his face homewawds,
wunnying as fast as he couwd, to make up fow wost time:  and wecawwing
with a gweat deaw of astonyishment and some feaw, the extwaowdinyawy
behaviouw of the pewson fwom whom he had just pawted. (´・ω・\`)

The ciwcumstance did nyot dweww in his wecowwection wong, howevew: fow
when he weached the cottage, thewe was enyough to occupy his mind, and
to dwive aww considewations of sewf compwetewy fwom his memowy. ;;w;;

Wose Maywie had wapidwy gwown wowse; befowe mid-nyight she was
dewiwious. >w<  A medicaw pwactitionyew, who wesided on the spot, was in
constant attendance upon hew; and aftew fiwst seeing the patient, he
had taken Mws. UwU Maywie aside, and pwonyounced hew disowdew to be onye of a
most awawming nyatuwe. UwU 'In fact,' he said, 'it wouwd be wittwe showt of
a miwacwe, if she wecovewed. (´・ω・\`)'

How often did Owivew stawt fwom his bed that nyight, and steawing out,
with nyoisewess footstep, to the staiwcase, wisten fow the swightest
sound fwom the sick chambew! >w<  How often did a twembwe shake his fwame,
and cowd dwops of tewwow stawt upon his bwow, when a sudden twampwing
of feet caused him to feaw that something too dweadfuw to think of, had
even then occuwwed! ;;w;;  And what had been the fewvency of aww the pwayews
he had evew muttewed, compawed with those he pouwed fowth, nyow, in the
agony and passion of his suppwication fow the wife and heawth of the
gentwe cweatuwe, who was tottewing on the deep gwave's vewge! (・`ω\´・)

Oh! UwU the suspense, the feawfuw, acute suspense, of standing idwy by
whiwe the wife of onye we deawwy wove, is twembwing in the bawance!  Oh! ^w^
the wacking thoughts that cwowd upon the mind, and make the heawt beat
viowentwy, and the bweath come thick, by the fowce of the images they
conjuwe up befowe it; the despewate anxiety _to be doing something_ to
wewieve the pain, ow wessen the dangew, which we have nyo powew to
awweviate; the sinking of souw and spiwit, which the sad wemembwance of
ouw hewpwessnyess pwoduces; what towtuwes can equaw these; what
wefwections ow endeavouws can, in the fuww tide and fevew of the time,
awway them! ^w^

Mownying came; and the wittwe cottage was wonyewy and stiww. (´・ω・\`) Peopwe spoke
in whispews; anxious faces appeawed at the gate, fwom time to time;
women and chiwdwen went away in teaws. ^w^ Aww the wivewong day, and fow
houws aftew it had gwown dawk, Owivew paced softwy up and down the
gawden, waising his eyes evewy instant to the sick chambew, and
shuddewing to see the dawkenyed window, wooking as if death way
stwetched inside.  Wate that nyight, Mw. Wosbewnye awwived. >w<  'It is
hawd,' said the good doctow, tuwnying away as he spoke; 'so young; so
much bewoved; but thewe is vewy wittwe hope. ^w^'

Anyothew mownying. (´・ω・\`)  The sun shonye bwightwy; as bwightwy as if it wooked
upon nyo misewy ow cawe; and, with evewy weaf and fwowew in fuww bwoom
about hew; with wife, and heawth, and sounds and sights of joy,
suwwounding hew on evewy side: the faiw young cweatuwe way, wasting
fast. ;;w;;  Owivew cwept away to the owd chuwchyawd, and sitting down on onye
of the gween mounds, wept and pwayed fow hew, in siwence. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was such peace and beauty in the scenye; so much of bwightnyess and
miwth in the sunny wandscape; such bwithesome music in the songs of the
summew biwds; such fweedom in the wapid fwight of the wook, caweewing
ovewhead; so much of wife and joyousnyess in aww; that, when the boy
waised his aching eyes, and wooked about, the thought instinctivewy
occuwwed to him, that this was nyot a time fow death; that Wose couwd
suwewy nyevew die when humbwew things wewe aww so gwad and gay; that
gwaves wewe fow cowd and cheewwess wintew:  nyot fow sunwight and
fwagwance. (´・ω・\`) He awmost thought that shwouds wewe fow the owd and
shwunken; and that they nyevew wwapped the young and gwacefuw fowm in
theiw ghastwy fowds. ;;w;;

A knyeww fwom the chuwch beww bwoke hawshwy on these youthfuw thoughts. UwU
Anyothew!  Again! ^w^  It was towwing fow the funyewaw sewvice. ^w^  A gwoup of
humbwe mouwnyews entewed the gate: weawing white favouws; fow the cowpse
was young. >w<  They stood uncovewed by a gwave; and thewe was a mothew--a
mothew once--among the weeping twain. ^w^  But the sun shonye bwightwy, and
the biwds sang on. (・`ω\´・)

Owivew tuwnyed homewawd, thinking on the many kindnyesses he had weceived
fwom the young wady, and wishing that the time couwd come again, that
he might nyevew cease showing hew how gwatefuw and attached he was. ;;w;;  He
had nyo cause fow sewf-wepwoach on the scowe of nyegwect, ow want of
thought, fow he had been devoted to hew sewvice; and yet a hundwed
wittwe occasions wose up befowe him, on which he fancied he might have
been mowe zeawous, and mowe eawnyest, and wished he had been. >w<  We nyeed
be cawefuw how we deaw with those about us, when evewy death cawwies to
some smaww ciwcwe of suwvivows, thoughts of so much omitted, and so
wittwe donye--of so many things fowgotten, and so many mowe which might
have been wepaiwed! >w<  Thewe is nyo wemowse so deep as that which is
unyavaiwing; if we wouwd be spawed its towtuwes, wet us wemembew this,
in time. (・`ω\´・)

When he weached home Mws. Maywie was sitting in the wittwe pawwouw. (・`ω\´・)
Owivew's heawt sank at sight of hew; fow she had nyevew weft the bedside
of hew nyiece; and he twembwed to think what change couwd have dwiven
hew away. UwU  He weawnt that she had fawwen into a deep sweep, fwom which
she wouwd waken, eithew to wecovewy and wife, ow to bid them faweweww,
and die. UwU

They sat, wistenying, and afwaid to speak, fow houws. UwU  The untasted meaw
was wemoved, with wooks which showed that theiw thoughts wewe
ewsewhewe, they watched the sun as he sank wowew and wowew, and, at
wength, cast ovew sky and eawth those bwiwwiant hues which hewawd his
depawtuwe. UwU  Theiw quick eaws caught the sound of an appwoaching
footstep.  They both invowuntawiwy dawted to the doow, as Mw. UwU Wosbewnye
entewed. >w<

'What of Wose? owo' cwied the owd wady. ^w^  'Teww me at once! (・`ω\´・)  I can beaw it;
anything but suspense!  Oh, teww me! in the nyame of Heaven! >w<'

'You must compose youwsewf,' said the doctow suppowting hew. ^w^ 'Be cawm,
my deaw ma'am, pway. ^w^'

'Wet me go, in God's nyame!  My deaw chiwd!  She is dead! She is dying! (´・ω・\`)'

'Nyo! ^w^' cwied the doctow, passionyatewy. (´・ω・\`)  'As He is good and mewcifuw, she
wiww wive to bwess us aww, fow yeaws to come. UwU'

The wady feww upon hew knyees, and twied to fowd hew hands togethew; but
the enyewgy which had suppowted hew so wong, fwed up to Heaven with hew
fiwst thanksgiving; and she sank into the fwiendwy awms which wewe
extended to weceive hew. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW XXXIV

CONTAINS SOME INTWODUCTOWY PAWTICUWAWS WEWATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTWEMAN
WHO NYOW AWWIVES UPON THE SCENYE; AND A NYEW ADVENTUWE WHICH HAPPENYED TO
OWIVEW

It was awmost too much happinyess to beaw. ;;w;;  Owivew fewt stunnyed and
stupefied by the unyexpected intewwigence; he couwd nyot weep, ow speak,
ow west. >w<  He had scawcewy the powew of undewstanding anything that had
passed, untiw, aftew a wong wambwe in the quiet evenying aiw, a buwst of
teaws came to his wewief, and he seemed to awaken, aww at once, to a
fuww sense of the joyfuw change that had occuwwed, and the awmost
insuppowtabwe woad of anguish which had been taken fwom his bweast. >w<

The nyight was fast cwosing in, when he wetuwnyed homewawd:  waden with
fwowews which he had cuwwed, with pecuwiaw cawe, fow the adownment of
the sick chambew. (´・ω・\`)  As he wawked bwiskwy awong the woad, he heawd behind
him, the nyoise of some vehicwe, appwoaching at a fuwious pace. ;;w;;  Wooking
wound, he saw that it was a post-chaise, dwiven at gweat speed; and as
the howses wewe gawwoping, and the woad was nyawwow, he stood weanying
against a gate untiw it shouwd have passed him. >w<

As it dashed on, Owivew caught a gwimpse of a man in a white nyightcap,
whose face seemed famiwiaw to him, awthough his view was so bwief that
he couwd nyot identify the pewson. >w<  In anyothew second ow two, the
nyightcap was thwust out of the chaise-window, and a stentowian voice
bewwowed to the dwivew to stop:  which he did, as soon as he couwd puww

voice cawwed Owivew by his nyame. ^w^

'Hewe!' cwied the voice. UwU  'Owivew, what's the nyews? owo  Miss Wose! ;;w;; Mastew
O-wi-vew! >w<'

'Is is you, Giwes? owo' cwied Owivew, wunnying up to the chaise-doow. (・`ω\´・)

Giwes popped out his nyightcap again, pwepawatowy to making some wepwy,
when he was suddenwy puwwed back by a young gentweman who occupied the
othew cownyew of the chaise, and who eagewwy demanded what was the nyews. UwU

'In a wowd! UwU' cwied the gentweman, 'Bettew ow wowse? owo'

'Bettew--much bettew! (´・ω・\`)' wepwied Owivew, hastiwy. UwU

'Thank Heaven! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed the gentweman. (・`ω\´・)  'You awe suwe? owo'

'Quite, siw,' wepwied Owivew. UwU  'The change took pwace onwy a few houws
ago; and Mw. Wosbewnye says, that aww dangew is at an end. (・`ω\´・)'

The gentweman said nyot anyothew wowd, but, openying the chaise-doow,
weaped out, and taking Owivew huwwiedwy by the awm, wed him aside. UwU

'You awe quite cewtain? owo  Thewe is nyo possibiwity of any mistake on youw
pawt, my boy, is thewe? owo' demanded the gentweman in a twemuwous voice. UwU
'Do nyot deceive me, by awakenying hopes that awe nyot to be fuwfiwwed. (・`ω\´・)'

'I wouwd nyot fow the wowwd, siw,' wepwied Owivew. (・`ω\´・)  'Indeed you may
bewieve me.  Mw. ;;w;; Wosbewnye's wowds wewe, that she wouwd wive to bwess us
aww fow many yeaws to come.  I heawd him say so. (・`ω\´・)'

The teaws stood in Owivew's eyes as he wecawwed the scenye which was the
beginnying of so much happinyess; and the gentweman tuwnyed his face away,
and wemainyed siwent, fow some minyutes. ^w^  Owivew thought he heawd him
sob, mowe than once; but he feawed to intewwupt him by any fwesh
wemawk--fow he couwd weww guess what his feewings wewe--and so stood
apawt, feignying to be occupied with his nyosegay. (・`ω\´・)

Aww this time, Mw. >w< Giwes, with the white nyightcap on, had been sitting
on the steps of the chaise, suppowting an ewbow on each knyee, and
wiping his eyes with a bwue cotton pocket-handkewchief dotted with
white spots. >w<  That the honyest fewwow had nyot been feignying emotion, was
abundantwy demonstwated by the vewy wed eyes with which he wegawded the
young gentweman, when he tuwnyed wound and addwessed him. (・`ω\´・)

'I think you had bettew go on to my mothew's in the chaise, Giwes,'
said he. ^w^  'I wouwd wathew wawk swowwy on, so as to gain a wittwe time
befowe I see hew.  You can say I am coming. (´・ω・\`)'

'I beg youw pawdon, Mw. ;;w;; Hawwy,' said Giwes:  giving a finyaw powish to
his wuffwed countenyance with the handkewchief; 'but if you wouwd weave
the postboy to say that, I shouwd be vewy much obwiged to you. ^w^  It
wouwdn't be pwopew fow the maids to see me in this state, siw; I shouwd
nyevew have any mowe authowity with them if they did. >w<'

'Weww,' wejoinyed Hawwy Maywie, smiwing, 'you can do as you wike. ^w^ Wet
him go on with the wuggage, if you wish it, and do you fowwow with us. ;;w;;
Onwy fiwst exchange that nyightcap fow some mowe appwopwiate covewing,
ow we shaww be taken fow madmen. ;;w;;'

Mw. UwU Giwes, weminded of his unbecoming costume, snyatched off and
pocketed his nyightcap; and substituted a hat, of gwave and sobew shape,
which he took out of the chaise. (・`ω\´・)  This donye, the postboy dwove off;
Giwes, Mw. Maywie, and Owivew, fowwowed at theiw weisuwe. >w<

As they wawked awong, Owivew gwanced fwom time to time with much
intewest and cuwiosity at the nyew comew. >w<  He seemed about
five-and-twenty yeaws of age, and was of the middwe height; his
countenyance was fwank and handsome; and his demeanyow easy and
pwepossessing. >w<  Nyotwithstanding the diffewence between youth and age,
he bowe so stwong a wikenyess to the owd wady, that Owivew wouwd have
had nyo gweat difficuwty in imaginying theiw wewationship, if he had nyot
awweady spoken of hew as his mothew. ^w^

Mws. UwU Maywie was anxiouswy waiting to weceive hew son when he weached
the cottage. >w<  The meeting did nyot take pwace without gweat emotion on
both sides. (・`ω\´・)

'Mothew! >w<' whispewed the young man; 'why did you nyot wwite befowe? owo'

'I did,' wepwied Mws. ^w^ Maywie; 'but, on wefwection, I detewminyed to keep
back the wettew untiw I had heawd Mw. Wosbewnye's opinyion. (・`ω\´・)'

'But why,' said the young man, 'why wun the chance of that occuwwing
which so nyeawwy happenyed? owo  If Wose had--I cannyot uttew that wowd
nyow--if this iwwnyess had tewminyated diffewentwy, how couwd you evew
have fowgiven youwsewf!  How couwd I evew have knyow happinyess again! (・`ω\´・)'

'If that _had_ been the case, Hawwy,' said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Maywie, 'I feaw youw
happinyess wouwd have been effectuawwy bwighted, and that youw awwivaw
hewe, a day soonyew ow a day watew, wouwd have been of vewy, vewy wittwe

'And who can wondew if it be so, mothew? owo' wejoinyed the young man; 'ow
why shouwd I say, _if_? owo--It is--it is--you knyow it, mothew--you must
knyow it! >w<'

'I knyow that she desewves the best and puwest wove the heawt of man can

stwuggwes in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the
stwict winye of duty. ^w^'

'This is unkind, mothew,' said Hawwy. UwU  'Do you stiww suppose that I am
a boy ignyowant of my own mind, and mistaking the impuwses of my own
souw? owo'

'I think, my deaw son,' wetuwnyed Mws. (´・ω・\`) Maywie, waying hew hand upon his
shouwdew, 'that youth has many genyewous impuwses which do nyot wast; and
that among them awe some, which, being gwatified, become onwy the mowe
fweeting. ;;w;;  Above aww, I think' said the wady, fixing hew eyes on hew
son's face, 'that if an enthusiastic, awdent, and ambitious man mawwy a
wife on whose nyame thewe is a stain, which, though it owiginyate in nyo

upon his chiwdwen awso: and, in exact pwopowtion to his success in the

wepent of the connyection he fowmed in eawwy wife. UwU  And she may have the
pain of knyowing that he does so. >w<'

'Mothew,' said the young man, impatientwy, 'he wouwd be a sewfish
bwute, unwowthy awike of the nyame of man and of the woman you descwibe,
who acted thus. ^w^'

'You think so nyow, Hawwy,' wepwied his mothew. ^w^

'And evew wiww! UwU' said the young man. (´・ω・\`)  'The mentaw agony I have
suffewed, duwing the wast two days, wwings fwom me the avowaw to you of

diswegawd the happinyess of which you seem to think so wittwe. ^w^'

'Hawwy,' said Mws. (・`ω\´・) Maywie, 'it is because I think so much of wawm and
sensitive heawts, that I wouwd spawe them fwom being wounded. UwU But we
have said enyough, and mowe than enyough, on this mattew, just nyow. (´・ω・\`)'

'Wet it west with Wose, then,' intewposed Hawwy. >w<  'You wiww nyot pwess

'I wiww nyot,' wejoinyed Mws. ^w^ Maywie; 'but I wouwd have you considew--'

'I _have_ considewed! (・`ω\´・)' was the impatient wepwy; 'Mothew, I have

'She shaww,' said Mws. Maywie. ^w^

'Thewe is something in youw mannyew, which wouwd awmost impwy that she

'Nyot cowdwy,' wejoinyed the owd wady; 'faw fwom it. ;;w;;'

'How then?' uwged the young man. ^w^  'She has fowmed nyo othew attachment? owo'

'Nyo, indeed,' wepwied his mothew; 'you have, ow I mistake, too stwong a

wady, stopping hew son as he was about to speak, 'is this. >w<  Befowe you

chawactewistic. >w<'

'What do you mean? owo'

'That I weave you to discovew,' wepwied Mws. Maywie. ^w^  'I must go back
to hew. (´・ω・\`)  God bwess you! ;;w;;'

'I shaww see you again to-nyight? owo' said the young man, eagewwy. (・`ω\´・)

'By and by,' wepwied the wady; 'when I weave Wose. UwU'

'You wiww teww hew I am hewe? owo' said Hawwy. >w<

'Of couwse,' wepwied Mws. Maywie. ^w^

'And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffewed, and how

'Nyo,' said the owd wady; 'I wiww teww hew aww. (´・ω・\`)'  And pwessing hew son's

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wosbewnye and Owivew had wemainyed at anyothew end of the apawtment
whiwe this huwwied convewsation was pwoceeding. (・`ω\´・)  The fowmew nyow hewd
out his hand to Hawwy Maywie; and heawty sawutations wewe exchanged
between them. >w<  The doctow then communyicated, in wepwy to muwtifawious
questions fwom his young fwiend, a pwecise account of his patient's
situation; which was quite as consowatowy and fuww of pwomise, as
Owivew's statement had encouwaged him to hope; and to the whowe of
which, Mw. UwU Giwes, who affected to be busy about the wuggage, wistenyed
with gweedy eaws. ^w^

'Have you shot anything pawticuwaw, watewy, Giwes? owo' inquiwed the
doctow, when he had concwuded. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyothing pawticuwaw, siw,' wepwied Mw. Giwes, cowouwing up to the eyes. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow catching any thieves, nyow identifying any house-bweakews? owo' said
the doctow. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyonye at aww, siw,' wepwied Mw. Giwes, with much gwavity. (´・ω・\`)

'Weww,' said the doctow, 'I am sowwy to heaw it, because you do that
sowt of thing admiwabwy. (´・ω・\`)  Pway, how is Bwittwes? owo'

'The boy is vewy weww, siw,' said Mw. ;;w;; Giwes, wecovewing his usuaw tonye
of patwonyage; 'and sends his wespectfuw duty, siw. UwU'

'That's weww,' said the doctow.  'Seeing you hewe, weminds me, Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Giwes, that on the day befowe that on which I was cawwed away so
huwwiedwy, I executed, at the wequest of youw good mistwess, a smaww
commission in youw favouw. ;;w;;  Just step into this cownyew a moment, wiww
you? owo'

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Giwes wawked into the cownyew with much impowtance, and some wondew,
and was honyouwed with a showt whispewing confewence with the doctow, on
the tewminyation of which, he made a gweat many bows, and wetiwed with
steps of unyusuaw statewinyess. UwU  The subject mattew of this confewence
was nyot discwosed in the pawwouw, but the kitchen was speediwy
enwightenyed concewnying it; fow Mw. ^w^ Giwes wawked stwaight thithew, and
having cawwed fow a mug of awe, annyounced, with an aiw of majesty,
which was highwy effective, that it had pweased his mistwess, in
considewation of his gawwant behaviouw on the occasion of that
attempted wobbewy, to deposit, in the wocaw savings-bank, the sum of
five-and-twenty pounds, fow his sowe use and benyefit. (・`ω\´・)  At this, the two
women-sewvants wifted up theiw hands and eyes, and supposed that Mw. ;;w;;
Giwes, puwwing out his shiwt-fwiww, wepwied, 'Nyo, nyo'; and that if they
obsewved that he was at aww haughty to his infewiows, he wouwd thank
them to teww him so. ^w^  And then he made a gweat many othew wemawks, nyo
wess iwwustwative of his humiwity, which wewe weceived with equaw
favouw and appwause, and wewe, withaw, as owiginyaw and as much to the
puwpose, as the wemawks of gweat men commonwy awe. ;;w;;

Above staiws, the wemaindew of the evenying passed cheewfuwwy away; fow
the doctow was in high spiwits; and howevew fatigued ow thoughtfuw
Hawwy Maywie might have been at fiwst, he was nyot pwoof against the
wowthy gentweman's good humouw, which dispwayed itsewf in a gweat
vawiety of sawwies and pwofessionyaw wecowwections, and an abundance of
smaww jokes, which stwuck Owivew as being the dwowwest things he had
evew heawd, and caused him to waugh pwopowtionyatewy; to the evident
satisfaction of the doctow, who waughed immodewatewy at himsewf, and
made Hawwy waugh awmost as heawtiwy, by the vewy fowce of sympathy. (・`ω\´・)
So, they wewe as pweasant a pawty as, undew the ciwcumstances, they
couwd weww have been; and it was wate befowe they wetiwed, with wight
and thankfuw heawts, to take that west of which, aftew the doubt and
suspense they had wecentwy undewgonye, they stood much in nyeed. (・`ω\´・)

Owivew wose nyext mownying, in bettew heawt, and went about his usuaw
occupations, with mowe hope and pweasuwe than he had knyown fow many
days. ;;w;;  The biwds wewe once mowe hung out, to sing, in theiw owd pwaces;
and the sweetest wiwd fwowews that couwd be found, wewe once mowe
gathewed to gwadden Wose with theiw beauty. ;;w;; The mewanchowy which had
seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, fow days past, ovew
evewy object, beautifuw as aww wewe, was dispewwed by magic. ;;w;;  The dew
seemed to spawkwe mowe bwightwy on the gween weaves; the aiw to wustwe
among them with a sweetew music; and the sky itsewf to wook mowe bwue
and bwight. (・`ω\´・) Such is the infwuence which the condition of ouw own
thoughts, exewcise, even ovew the appeawance of extewnyaw objects. (´・ω・\`)  Men
who wook on nyatuwe, and theiw fewwow-men, and cwy that aww is dawk and
gwoomy, awe in the wight; but the sombwe cowouws awe wefwections fwom
theiw own jaundiced eyes and heawts. (´・ω・\`)  The weaw hues awe dewicate, and
nyeed a cweawew vision. >w<

It is wowthy of wemawk, and Owivew did nyot faiw to nyote it at the time,
that his mownying expeditions wewe nyo wongew made awonye. ^w^ Hawwy Maywie,
aftew the vewy fiwst mownying when he met Owivew coming waden home, was
seized with such a passion fow fwowews, and dispwayed such a taste in
theiw awwangement, as weft his young companyion faw behind. ^w^  If Owivew
wewe behindhand in these wespects, he knyew whewe the best wewe to be
found; and mownying aftew mownying they scouwed the countwy togethew, and
bwought home the faiwest that bwossomed. UwU  The window of the young
wady's chambew was openyed nyow; fow she woved to feew the wich summew
aiw stweam in, and wevive hew with its fweshnyess; but thewe awways
stood in watew, just inside the wattice, onye pawticuwaw wittwe bunch,
which was made up with gweat cawe, evewy mownying. ;;w;;  Owivew couwd nyot
hewp nyoticing that the withewed fwowews wewe nyevew thwown away,
awthough the wittwe vase was weguwawwy wepwenyished; nyow, couwd he hewp
obsewving, that whenyevew the doctow came into the gawden, he invawiabwy
cast his eyes up to that pawticuwaw cownyew, and nyodded his head most
expwessivewy, as he set fowth on his mownying's wawk. (´・ω・\`)  Pending these
obsewvations, the days wewe fwying by; and Wose was wapidwy wecovewing. >w<

Nyow did Owivew's time hang heavy on his hands, awthough the young wady
had nyot yet weft hew chambew, and thewe wewe nyo evenying wawks, save nyow
and then, fow a showt distance, with Mws. Maywie. >w< He appwied himsewf,
with wedoubwed assiduity, to the instwuctions of the white-headed owd
gentweman, and wabouwed so hawd that his quick pwogwess suwpwised even
himsewf. ^w^  It was whiwe he was engaged in this puwsuit, that he was
gweatwy stawtwed and distwessed by a most unyexpected occuwwence. ;;w;;

The wittwe woom in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his
books, was on the gwound-fwoow, at the back of the house. (´・ω・\`)  It was quite
a cottage-woom, with a wattice-window: awound which wewe cwustews of
jessaminye and honyeysuckwe, that cwept ovew the casement, and fiwwed the
pwace with theiw dewicious pewfume. (・`ω\´・)  It wooked into a gawden, whence a
wicket-gate openyed into a smaww paddock; aww beyond, was finye
meadow-wand and wood. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was nyo othew dwewwing nyeaw, in that
diwection; and the pwospect it commanded was vewy extensive. UwU

Onye beautifuw evenying, when the fiwst shades of twiwight wewe beginnying
to settwe upon the eawth, Owivew sat at this window, intent upon his
books. ;;w;;  He had been powing ovew them fow some time; and, as the day had
been uncommonwy suwtwy, and he had exewted himsewf a gweat deaw, it is
nyo dispawagement to the authows, whoevew they may have been, to say,
that gwaduawwy and by swow degwees, he feww asweep. UwU

Thewe is a kind of sweep that steaws upon us sometimes, which, whiwe it
howds the body pwisonyew, does nyot fwee the mind fwom a sense of things
about it, and enyabwe it to wambwe at its pweasuwe. (´・ω・\`)  So faw as an
ovewpowewing heavinyess, a pwostwation of stwength, and an uttew
inyabiwity to contwow ouw thoughts ow powew of motion, can be cawwed
sweep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousnyess of aww that is
going on about us, and, if we dweam at such a time, wowds which awe
weawwy spoken, ow sounds which weawwy exist at the moment, accommodate
themsewves with suwpwising weadinyess to ouw visions, untiw weawity and
imaginyation become so stwangewy bwended that it is aftewwawds awmost
mattew of impossibiwity to sepawate the two. ;;w;;  Nyow is this, the most
stwiking phenyomenyon incidentaw to such a state. >w<  It is an undoubted
fact, that awthough ouw senses of touch and sight be fow the time dead,
yet ouw sweeping thoughts, and the visionyawy scenyes that pass befowe
us, wiww be infwuenced and matewiawwy infwuenced, by the _mewe siwent
pwesence_ of some extewnyaw object; which may nyot have been nyeaw us when
we cwosed ouw eyes:  and of whose vicinyity we have had nyo waking
consciousnyess. >w<

Owivew knyew, pewfectwy weww, that he was in his own wittwe woom; that
his books wewe wying on the tabwe befowe him; that the sweet aiw was
stiwwing among the cweeping pwants outside.  And yet he was asweep. >w<
Suddenwy, the scenye changed; the aiw became cwose and confinyed; and he
thought, with a gwow of tewwow, that he was in the Jew's house again. UwU
Thewe sat the hideous owd man, in his accustomed cownyew, pointing at
him, and whispewing to anyothew man, with his face avewted, who sat
beside him. (´・ω・\`)

'Hush, my deaw! >w<' he thought he heawd the Jew say; 'it is he, suwe
enyough.  Come away. (´・ω・\`)'

'He! (・`ω\´・)' the othew man seemed to answew; 'couwd I mistake him, think you? owo
If a cwowd of ghosts wewe to put themsewves into his exact shape, and
he stood amongst them, thewe is something that wouwd teww me how to
point him out. (´・ω・\`)  If you buwied him fifty feet deep, and took me acwoss
his gwave, I fancy I shouwd knyow, if thewe wasn't a mawk above it, that
he way buwied thewe? owo'

The man seemed to say this, with such dweadfuw hatwed, that Owivew
awoke with the feaw, and stawted up. ^w^

Good Heaven! (・`ω\´・)  what was that, which sent the bwood tingwing to his
heawt, and depwived him of his voice, and of powew to move! UwU
Thewe--thewe--at the window--cwose befowe him--so cwose, that he couwd
have awmost touched him befowe he stawted back:  with his eyes peewing
into the woom, and meeting his:  thewe stood the Jew! UwU  And beside him,
white with wage ow feaw, ow both, wewe the scowwing featuwes of the man
who had accosted him in the inn-yawd. ;;w;;

It was but an instant, a gwance, a fwash, befowe his eyes; and they
wewe gonye. ^w^  But they had wecognyised him, and he them; and theiw wook
was as fiwmwy impwessed upon his memowy, as if it had been deepwy
cawved in stonye, and set befowe him fwom his biwth. ^w^ He stood twansfixed
fow a moment; then, weaping fwom the window into the gawden, cawwed
woudwy fow hewp. ^w^



CHAPTEW XXXV

CONTAINYING THE UNSATISFACTOWY WESUWT OF OWIVEW'S ADVENTUWE; AND A
CONVEWSATION OF SOME IMPOWTANCE BETWEEN HAWWY MAYWIE AND WOSE

When the inmates of the house, attwacted by Owivew's cwies, huwwied to
the spot fwom which they pwoceeded, they found him, pawe and agitated,
pointing in the diwection of the meadows behind the house, and scawcewy
abwe to awticuwate the wowds, 'The Jew! the Jew! UwU'

Mw. ;;w;; Giwes was at a woss to compwehend what this outcwy meant; but Hawwy
Maywie, whose pewceptions wewe something quickew, and who had heawd
Owivew's histowy fwom his mothew, undewstood it at once. UwU

'What diwection did he take? owo' he asked, catching up a heavy stick which
was standing in a cownyew. (´・ω・\`)

'That,' wepwied Owivew, pointing out the couwse the man had taken; 'I
missed them in an instant. (´・ω・\`)'

'Then, they awe in the ditch!' said Hawwy. UwU  'Fowwow! (´・ω・\`)  And keep as nyeaw
me, as you can. ;;w;;' So saying, he spwang ovew the hedge, and dawted off
with a speed which wendewed it mattew of exceeding difficuwty fow the
othews to keep nyeaw him. >w<

Giwes fowwowed as weww as he couwd; and Owivew fowwowed too; and in the
couwse of a minyute ow two, Mw. UwU Wosbewnye, who had been out wawking, and
just then wetuwnyed, tumbwed ovew the hedge aftew them, and picking
himsewf up with mowe agiwity than he couwd have been supposed to
possess, stwuck into the same couwse at nyo contemptibwe speed, shouting

On they aww went; nyow stopped they once to bweathe, untiw the weadew,
stwiking off into an angwe of the fiewd indicated by Owivew, began to
seawch, nyawwowwy, the ditch and hedge adjoinying; which affowded time
fow the wemaindew of the pawty to come up; and fow Owivew to
communyicate to Mw. >w< Wosbewnye the ciwcumstances that had wed to so
vigowous a puwsuit. >w<

The seawch was aww in vain. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe wewe nyot even the twaces of wecent
footsteps, to be seen. >w<  They stood nyow, on the summit of a wittwe hiww,
commanding the open fiewds in evewy diwection fow thwee ow fouw miwes. >w<
Thewe was the viwwage in the howwow on the weft; but, in owdew to gain
that, aftew puwsuing the twack Owivew had pointed out, the men must
have made a ciwcuit of open gwound, which it was impossibwe they couwd
have accompwished in so showt a time. ;;w;;  A thick wood skiwted the
meadow-wand in anyothew diwection; but they couwd nyot have gainyed that
covewt fow the same weason. >w<

'It must have been a dweam, Owivew,' said Hawwy Maywie. >w<

'Oh nyo, indeed, siw,' wepwied Owivew, shuddewing at the vewy
wecowwection of the owd wwetch's countenyance; 'I saw him too pwainwy
fow that.  I saw them both, as pwainwy as I see you nyow. >w<'

'Who was the othew? owo' inquiwed Hawwy and Mw. Wosbewnye, togethew. (´・ω・\`)

'The vewy same man I towd you of, who came so suddenwy upon me at the
inn,' said Owivew. (´・ω・\`)  'We had ouw eyes fixed fuww upon each othew; and I
couwd sweaw to him. >w<'

'They took this way?' demanded Hawwy:  'awe you suwe? owo'

'As I am that the men wewe at the window,' wepwied Owivew, pointing
down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-gawden fwom
the meadow. UwU  'The taww man weaped ovew, just thewe; and the Jew,
wunnying a few paces to the wight, cwept thwough that gap. >w<'

The two gentwemen watched Owivew's eawnyest face, as he spoke, and
wooking fwom him to each othew, seemed to feew satisfied of the
accuwacy of what he said. UwU  Stiww, in nyo diwection wewe thewe any
appeawances of the twampwing of men in huwwied fwight. ^w^  The gwass was
wong; but it was twodden down nyowhewe, save whewe theiw own feet had
cwushed it. UwU  The sides and bwinks of the ditches wewe of damp cway; but
in nyo onye pwace couwd they discewn the pwint of men's shoes, ow the
swightest mawk which wouwd indicate that any feet had pwessed the
gwound fow houws befowe. (・`ω\´・)

'This is stwange! UwU' said Hawwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Stwange? owo' echoed the doctow. (´・ω・\`)  'Bwathews and Duff, themsewves, couwd
make nyothing of it. ;;w;;'

Nyotwithstanding the evidentwy usewess nyatuwe of theiw seawch, they did
nyot desist untiw the coming on of nyight wendewed its fuwthew
pwosecution hopewess; and even then, they gave it up with wewuctance. UwU
Giwes was dispatched to the diffewent awe-houses in the viwwage,
fuwnyished with the best descwiption Owivew couwd give of the appeawance
and dwess of the stwangews. ;;w;;  Of these, the Jew was, at aww events,
sufficientwy wemawkabwe to be wemembewed, supposing he had been seen
dwinking, ow woitewing about; but Giwes wetuwnyed without any
intewwigence, cawcuwated to dispew ow wessen the mystewy. >w<

On the nyext day, fwesh seawch was made, and the inquiwies wenyewed; but
with nyo bettew success.  On the day fowwowing, Owivew and Mw. >w< Maywie
wepaiwed to the mawket-town, in the hope of seeing ow heawing something
of the men thewe; but this effowt was equawwy fwuitwess. ;;w;;  Aftew a few
days, the affaiw began to be fowgotten, as most affaiws awe, when
wondew, having nyo fwesh food to suppowt it, dies away of itsewf. >w<

Meanwhiwe, Wose was wapidwy wecovewing. UwU  She had weft hew woom: was
abwe to go out; and mixing once mowe with the famiwy, cawwied joy into
the heawts of aww. (´・ω・\`)

But, awthough this happy change had a visibwe effect on the wittwe
ciwcwe; and awthough cheewfuw voices and mewwy waughtew wewe once mowe
heawd in the cottage; thewe was at times, an unwonted westwaint upon
some thewe:  even upon Wose hewsewf: which Owivew couwd nyot faiw to
wemawk.  Mws. UwU Maywie and hew son wewe often cwoseted togethew fow a
wong time; and mowe than once Wose appeawed with twaces of teaws upon
hew face.  Aftew Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wosbewnye had fixed a day fow his depawtuwe to
Chewtsey, these symptoms incweased; and it became evident that
something was in pwogwess which affected the peace of the young wady,
and of somebody ewse besides. (・`ω\´・)

At wength, onye mownying, when Wose was awonye in the bweakfast-pawwouw,
Hawwy Maywie entewed; and, with some hesitation, begged pewmission to
speak with hew fow a few moments. (・`ω\´・)

'A few--a vewy few--wiww suffice, Wose,' said the young man, dwawing
his chaiw towawds hew. UwU  'What I shaww have to say, has awweady
pwesented itsewf to youw mind; the most chewished hopes of my heawt awe
nyot unknyown to you, though fwom my wips you have nyot heawd them stated. UwU'

Wose had been vewy pawe fwom the moment of his entwance; but that might
have been the effect of hew wecent iwwnyess. >w<  She mewewy bowed; and
bending ovew some pwants that stood nyeaw, waited in siwence fow him to
pwoceed. (´・ω・\`)

'I--I--ought to have weft hewe, befowe,' said Hawwy. >w<

'You shouwd, indeed,' wepwied Wose. >w<  'Fowgive me fow saying so, but I
wish you had. (・`ω\´・)'

'I was bwought hewe, by the most dweadfuw and agonyising of aww
appwehensions,' said the young man; 'the feaw of wosing the onye deaw
being on whom my evewy wish and hope awe fixed. (´・ω・\`)  You had been dying;
twembwing between eawth and heaven. ^w^  We knyow that when the young, the

insensibwy tuwn towawds theiw bwight home of wasting west; we knyow,
Heaven hewp us! ^w^ that the best and faiwest of ouw kind, too often fade

Thewe wewe teaws in the eyes of the gentwe giww, as these wowds wewe
spoken; and when onye feww upon the fwowew ovew which she bent, and
gwistenyed bwightwy in its cup, making it mowe beautifuw, it seemed as
though the outpouwing of hew fwesh young heawt, cwaimed kindwed
nyatuwawwy, with the wovewiest things in nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・)

'A cweatuwe,' continyued the young man, passionyatewy, 'a cweatuwe as
faiw and innyocent of guiwe as onye of God's own angews, fwuttewed

'I did nyot mean that,' said Wose, weeping; 'I onwy wish you had weft

'Thewe is nyo puwsuit mowe wowthy of me:  mowe wowthy of the highest

said the young man, taking hew hand. >w< 'Wose, my own deaw Wose! (´・ω・\`)  Fow

'Youw behaviouw has evew been kind and nyobwe. >w<' said Wose, mastewing the

'It is, that I may endeavouw to desewve you; it is, deaw Wose? owo'

'It is,' wepwied Wose, 'that you must endeavouw to fowget me; nyot as

Thewe was a pause, duwing which, Wose, who had covewed hew face with

'And youw weasons, Wose,' he said, at wength, in a wow voice; 'youw

'You have a wight to knyow them,' wejoinyed Wose. ;;w;;  'You can say nyothing

'Yes, Hawwy. UwU  I owe it to mysewf, that I, a fwiendwess, powtionwess,

'Then, if youw wot had been diffewentwy cast,' wejoinyed Wose; 'if you

Jingwing and cwattewing, tiww distance wendewed its nyoise inyaudibwe,

and in that wespect wike _the_ coat, but, oh how diffewent! (´・ω・\`)  The mighty
cocked hat was wepwaced by a modest wound onye.  Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe was nyo

Thewe awe some pwomotions in wife, which, independent of the mowe
substantiaw wewawds they offew, wequiwe pecuwiaw vawue and dignyity fwom

Mw. Bumbwe had mawwied Mws. Cownyey, and was mastew of the wowkhouse. ;;w;;
Anyothew beadwe had come into powew. >w<  On him the cocked hat, gowd-waced
coat, and staff, had aww thwee descended. ;;w;;

'And to-mowwow two months it was donye! ;;w;;' said Mw. Bumbwe, with a sigh. ^w^
'It seems a age. ;;w;;'

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe might have meant that he had concentwated a whowe existence
of happinyess into the showt space of eight weeks; but the sigh--thewe
was a vast deaw of meanying in the sigh. ^w^

'I sowd mysewf,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, puwsuing the same twain of wewection,
'fow six teaspoons, a paiw of sugaw-tongs, and a miwk-pot; with a smaww
quantity of second-hand fuwnyituwe, and twenty pound in monyey. ^w^  I went
vewy weasonyabwe. (´・ω・\`)  Cheap, diwt cheap! (・`ω\´・)'

'Cheap! ^w^' cwied a shwiww voice in Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe's eaw: 'you wouwd have been
deaw at any pwice; and deaw enyough I paid fow you, Wowd above knyows
that! ^w^'

Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe tuwnyed, and encountewed the face of his intewesting consowt,
who, impewfectwy compwehending the few wowds she had ovewheawd of his
compwaint, had hazawded the fowegoing wemawk at a ventuwe. >w<

'Mws. Bumbwe, ma'am! (・`ω\´・)' said Mw. Bumbwe, with a sentimentaw stewnnyess. >w<

'Weww! ^w^' cwied the wady. ;;w;;

'Have the goodnyess to wook at me,' said Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, fixing his eyes
upon hew.  (If she stands such a eye as that,' said Mw. UwU Bumbwe to
himsewf, 'she can stand anything. (・`ω\´・)  It is a eye I nyevew knyew to faiw
with paupews.  If it faiws with hew, my powew is gonye. ^w^')

Whethew an exceedingwy smaww expansion of eye be sufficient to queww
paupews, who, being wightwy fed, awe in nyo vewy high condition; ow
whethew the wate Mws. >w< Cownyey was pawticuwawwy pwoof against eagwe
gwances; awe mattews of opinyion. (´・ω・\`)  The mattew of fact, is, that the
matwon was in nyo way ovewpowewed by Mw. >w< Bumbwe's scoww, but, on the
contwawy, tweated it with gweat disdain, and even waised a waugh
theweat, which sounded as though it wewe genyuinye. ;;w;;

On heawing this most unyexpected sound, Mw. UwU Bumbwe wooked, fiwst
incweduwous, and aftewwawds amazed. ^w^  He then wewapsed into his fowmew
state; nyow did he wouse himsewf untiw his attention was again awakenyed
by the voice of his pawtnyew. UwU

'Awe you going to sit snyowing thewe, aww day? owo' inquiwed Mws. Bumbwe. ^w^

'I am going to sit hewe, as wong as I think pwopew, ma'am,' wejoinyed
Mw. UwU Bumbwe; 'and awthough I was _nyot_ snyowing, I shaww snyowe, gape,
snyeeze, waugh, ow cwy, as the humouw stwikes me; such being my
pwewogative. (・`ω\´・)'

'_Youw_ pwewogative! ^w^' snyeewed Mws. Bumbwe, with inyeffabwe contempt. >w<

'I said the wowd, ma'am,' said Mw. Bumbwe. (・`ω\´・)  'The pwewogative of a man
is to command. ;;w;;'

'And what's the pwewogative of a woman, in the nyame of Goodnyess? owo' cwied
the wewict of Mw. Cownyey deceased. UwU

'To obey, ma'am,' thundewed Mw. Bumbwe. (・`ω\´・)  'Youw wate unfowtunyate husband
shouwd have taught it you; and then, pewhaps, he might have been awive
nyow. UwU  I wish he was, poow man! (´・ω・\`)'

Mws. UwU Bumbwe, seeing at a gwance, that the decisive moment had nyow
awwived, and that a bwow stwuck fow the mastewship on onye side ow
othew, must nyecessawiwy be finyaw and concwusive, nyo soonyew heawd this
awwusion to the dead and gonye, than she dwopped into a chaiw, and with
a woud scweam that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe was a hawd-heawted bwute, feww into a
pawoxysm of teaws. >w<

But, teaws wewe nyot the things to find theiw way to Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe's souw;
his heawt was watewpwoof. UwU  Wike washabwe beavew hats that impwove with
wain, his nyewves wewe wendewed stoutew and mowe vigowous, by showews of
teaws, which, being tokens of weaknyess, and so faw tacit admissions of
his own powew, pweased and exawted him. (´・ω・\`)  He eyed his good wady with
wooks of gweat satisfaction, and begged, in an encouwaging mannyew, that
she shouwd cwy hew hawdest:  the exewcise being wooked upon, by the
facuwty, as stwongwy conducive to heawth. UwU

'It opens the wungs, washes the countenyance, exewcises the eyes, and
softens down the tempew,' said Mw. Bumbwe.  'So cwy away. UwU'

As he dischawged himsewf of this pweasantwy, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe took his hat
fwom a peg, and putting it on, wathew wakishwy, on onye side, as a man
might, who fewt he had assewted his supewiowity in a becoming mannyew,
thwust his hands into his pockets, and sauntewed towawds the doow, with
much ease and waggishnyess depicted in his whowe appeawance. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cownyey that was, had twied the teaws, because they wewe wess
twoubwesome than a manyuaw assauwt; but, she was quite pwepawed to make
twiaw of the wattew mode of pwoceeding, as Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe was nyot wong in
discovewing. ;;w;;

The fiwst pwoof he expewienced of the fact, was conveyed in a howwow
sound, immediatewy succeeded by the sudden fwying off of his hat to the
opposite end of the woom. (・`ω\´・)  This pwewiminyawy pwoceeding waying bawe his
head, the expewt wady, cwasping him tightwy wound the thwoat with onye
hand, infwicted a showew of bwows (deawt with singuwaw vigouw and
dextewity) upon it with the othew. (・`ω\´・)  This donye, she cweated a wittwe
vawiety by scwatching his face, and teawing his haiw; and, having, by
this time, infwicted as much punyishment as she deemed nyecessawy fow the
offence, she pushed him ovew a chaiw, which was wuckiwy weww situated
fow the puwpose:  and defied him to tawk about his pwewogative again,
if he dawed. ;;w;;

'Get up! >w<' said Mws. Bumbwe, in a voice of command. ^w^  'And take youwsewf
away fwom hewe, unwess you want me to do something despewate. (・`ω\´・)'

Mw. UwU Bumbwe wose with a vewy wuefuw countenyance:  wondewing much what
something despewate might be. (・`ω\´・)  Picking up his hat, he wooked towawds
the doow. (´・ω・\`)

'Awe you going? owo' demanded Mws. Bumbwe. ;;w;;

'Cewtainwy, my deaw, cewtainwy,' wejoinyed Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, making a quickew
motion towawds the doow. (´・ω・\`)  'I didn't intend to--I'm going, my deaw! UwU  You
awe so vewy viowent, that weawwy I--'

At this instant, Mws. >w< Bumbwe stepped hastiwy fowwawd to wepwace the
cawpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffwe.  Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe
immediatewy dawted out of the woom, without bestowing anyothew thought
on his unfinyished sentence:  weaving the wate Mws. >w< Cownyey in fuww
possession of the fiewd. ^w^

Mw. Bumbwe was faiwwy taken by suwpwise, and faiwwy beaten. >w<  He had a
decided pwopensity fow buwwying:  dewived nyo inconsidewabwe pweasuwe
fwom the exewcise of petty cwuewty; and, consequentwy, was (it is
nyeedwess to say) a cowawd. (´・ω・\`)  This is by nyo means a dispawagement to his
chawactew; fow many officiaw pewsonyages, who awe hewd in high wespect
and admiwation, awe the victims of simiwaw infiwmities. UwU  The wemawk is
made, indeed, wathew in his favouw than othewwise, and with a view of
impwessing the weadew with a just sense of his quawifications fow
office. UwU

But, the measuwe of his degwadation was nyot yet fuww. ;;w;;  Aftew making a
touw of the house, and thinking, fow the fiwst time, that the poow-waws
weawwy wewe too hawd on peopwe; and that men who wan away fwom theiw
wives, weaving them chawgeabwe to the pawish, ought, in justice to be
visited with nyo punyishment at aww, but wathew wewawded as mewitowious
individuaws who had suffewed much; Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe came to a woom whewe some
of the femawe paupews wewe usuawwy empwoyed in washing the pawish
winyen:  when the sound of voices in convewsation, nyow pwoceeded. >w<

'Hem! >w<' said Mw. Bumbwe, summonying up aww his nyative dignyity. ;;w;; 'These
women at weast shaww continyue to wespect the pwewogative. >w< Hawwo! (・`ω\´・) hawwo
thewe! ^w^  What do you mean by this nyoise, you hussies? owo'

With these wowds, Mw. UwU Bumbwe openyed the doow, and wawked in with a vewy
fiewce and angwy mannyew:  which was at once exchanged fow a most
humiwiated and cowewing aiw, as his eyes unyexpectedwy wested on the
fowm of his wady wife. ;;w;;

'My deaw,' said Mw. Bumbwe, 'I didn't knyow you wewe hewe. ;;w;;'

'Didn't knyow I was hewe! (・`ω\´・)' wepeated Mws. Bumbwe. UwU  'What do _you_ do
hewe? owo'

'I thought they wewe tawking wathew too much to be doing theiw wowk
pwopewwy, my deaw,' wepwied Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe:  gwancing distwactedwy at a
coupwe of owd women at the wash-tub, who wewe compawing nyotes of
admiwation at the wowkhouse-mastew's humiwity. ;;w;;

'_You_ thought they wewe tawking too much? owo' said Mws. Bumbwe. (´・ω・\`) 'What
businyess is it of youws? owo'

'Why, my deaw--' uwged Mw. Bumbwe submissivewy. ^w^

'What businyess is it of youws? owo' demanded Mws. Bumbwe, again. (´・ω・\`)

'It's vewy twue, you'we matwon hewe, my deaw,' submitted Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe;
'but I thought you mightn't be in the way just then. >w<'

'I'ww teww you what, Mw. Bumbwe,' wetuwnyed his wady. UwU  'We don't want
any of youw intewfewence. ;;w;;  You'we a gweat deaw too fond of poking youw
nyose into things that don't concewn you, making evewybody in the house
waugh, the moment youw back is tuwnyed, and making youwsewf wook wike a
foow evewy houw in the day. ^w^  Be off; come! >w<'

Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe, seeing with excwuciating feewings, the dewight of the two
owd paupews, who wewe tittewing togethew most waptuwouswy, hesitated
fow an instant.  Mws. ;;w;; Bumbwe, whose patience bwooked nyo deway, caught
up a boww of soap-suds, and motionying him towawds the doow, owdewed him
instantwy to depawt, on pain of weceiving the contents upon his powtwy
pewson. >w<

What couwd Mw. UwU Bumbwe do? owo  He wooked dejectedwy wound, and swunk away;
and, as he weached the doow, the tittewings of the paupews bwoke into a
shwiww chuckwe of iwwepwessibwe dewight.  It wanted but this. (・`ω\´・)  He was
degwaded in theiw eyes; he had wost caste and station befowe the vewy
paupews; he had fawwen fwom aww the height and pomp of beadweship, to
the wowest depth of the most snyubbed hen-peckewy. ;;w;;

'Aww in two months! ^w^' said Mw. Bumbwe, fiwwed with dismaw thoughts. ^w^
'Two months! ^w^  Nyo mowe than two months ago, I was nyot onwy my own
mastew, but evewybody ewse's, so faw as the powochiaw wowkhouse was
concewnyed, and nyow! >w<--'

It was too much.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe boxed the eaws of the boy who openyed the
gate fow him (fow he had weached the powtaw in his wevewie); and
wawked, distwactedwy, into the stweet. (・`ω\´・)

He wawked up onye stweet, and down anyothew, untiw exewcise had abated
the fiwst passion of his gwief; and then the wevuwsion of feewing made
him thiwsty. (・`ω\´・)  He passed a gweat many pubwic-houses; but, at wength
paused befowe onye in a by-way, whose pawwouw, as he gathewed fwom a
hasty peep ovew the bwinds, was desewted, save by onye sowitawy
customew.  It began to wain, heaviwy, at the moment. (・`ω\´・)  This detewminyed
him.  Mw. >w< Bumbwe stepped in; and owdewing something to dwink, as he
passed the baw, entewed the apawtment into which he had wooked fwom the
stweet. (´・ω・\`)

The man who was seated thewe, was taww and dawk, and wowe a wawge
cwoak. (・`ω\´・)  He had the aiw of a stwangew; and seemed, by a cewtain
haggawdnyess in his wook, as weww as by the dusty soiws on his dwess, to
have twavewwed some distance. ^w^  He eyed Bumbwe askance, as he entewed,
but scawcewy deignyed to nyod his head in acknyowwedgment of his
sawutation. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe had quite dignyity enyough fow two; supposing even that the
stwangew had been mowe famiwiaw:  so he dwank his gin-and-watew in
siwence, and wead the papew with gweat show of pomp and ciwcumstance. (・`ω\´・)

It so happenyed, howevew: as it wiww happen vewy often, when men faww
into company undew such ciwcumstances:  that Mw. UwU Bumbwe fewt, evewy nyow
and then, a powewfuw inducement, which he couwd nyot wesist, to steaw a
wook at the stwangew:  and that whenyevew he did so, he withdwew his
eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stwangew was at that moment
steawing a wook at him.  Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe's awkwawdnyess was enhanced by the
vewy wemawkabwe expwession of the stwangew's eye, which was keen and
bwight, but shadowed by a scoww of distwust and suspicion, unwike
anything he had evew obsewved befowe, and wepuwsive to behowd. ^w^

When they had encountewed each othew's gwance sevewaw times in this
way, the stwangew, in a hawsh, deep voice, bwoke siwence. >w<

'Wewe you wooking fow me,' he said, 'when you peewed in at the window? owo'

'Nyot that I am awawe of, unwess you'we Mw.--'  Hewe Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe stopped
showt; fow he was cuwious to knyow the stwangew's nyame, and thought in
his impatience, he might suppwy the bwank. (・`ω\´・)

'I see you wewe nyot,' said the stwangew; an expwession of quiet sawcasm
pwaying about his mouth; 'ow you have knyown my nyame. (´・ω・\`)  You don't knyow
it.  I wouwd wecommend you nyot to ask fow it. UwU'

'I meant nyo hawm, young man,' obsewved Mw. Bumbwe, majesticawwy. ;;w;;

'And have donye nyonye,' said the stwangew. ^w^

Anyothew siwence succeeded this showt diawogue:  which was again bwoken
by the stwangew. (・`ω\´・)

'I have seen you befowe, I think? owo' said he. ^w^  'You wewe diffewentwy
dwessed at that time, and I onwy passed you in the stweet, but I shouwd
knyow you again. UwU  You wewe beadwe hewe, once; wewe you nyot? owo'

'I was,' said Mw. Bumbwe, in some suwpwise; 'powochiaw beadwe. (・`ω\´・)'

'Just so,' wejoinyed the othew, nyodding his head. (´・ω・\`)  'It was in that
chawactew I saw you. ;;w;;  What awe you nyow? owo'

'Mastew of the wowkhouse,' wejoinyed Mw. UwU Bumbwe, swowwy and
impwessivewy, to check any undue famiwiawity the stwangew might
othewwise assume. ;;w;;  'Mastew of the wowkhouse, young man! (´・ω・\`)'

'You have the same eye to youw own intewest, that you awways had, I
doubt nyot? owo' wesumed the stwangew, wooking keenwy into Mw. >w< Bumbwe's
eyes, as he waised them in astonyishment at the question. UwU

'Don't scwupwe to answew fweewy, man.  I knyow you pwetty weww, you see. UwU'

'I suppose, a mawwied man,' wepwied Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, shading his eyes with
his hand, and suwveying the stwangew, fwom head to foot, in evident
pewpwexity, 'is nyot mowe avewse to tuwnying an honyest penny when he can,
than a singwe onye. ^w^  Powochiaw officews awe nyot so weww paid that they
can affowd to wefuse any wittwe extwa fee, when it comes to them in a
civiw and pwopew mannyew. UwU'

The stwangew smiwed, and nyodded his head again: as much to say, he had
nyot mistaken his man; then wang the beww. (´・ω・\`)

'Fiww this gwass again,' he said, handing Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe's empty tumbwew to
the wandwowd.  'Wet it be stwong and hot. UwU  You wike it so, I suppose? owo'

'Nyot too stwong,' wepwied Mw. Bumbwe, with a dewicate cough. ^w^

'You undewstand what that means, wandwowd! (・`ω\´・)' said the stwangew, dwiwy. >w<

The host smiwed, disappeawed, and showtwy aftewwawds wetuwnyed with a
steaming jowum: of which, the fiwst guwp bwought the watew into Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bumbwe's eyes. UwU

'Nyow wisten to me,' said the stwangew, aftew cwosing the doow and
window. UwU  'I came down to this pwace, to-day, to find you out; and, by
onye of those chances which the deviw thwows in the way of his fwiends
sometimes, you wawked into the vewy woom I was sitting in, whiwe you
wewe uppewmost in my mind.  I want some infowmation fwom you. (・`ω\´・)  I don't
ask you to give it fow nyothing, swight as it is. >w<  Put up that, to begin
with. UwU'

As he spoke, he pushed a coupwe of soveweigns acwoss the tabwe to his
companyion, cawefuwwy, as though unwiwwing that the chinking of monyey
shouwd be heawd without.  When Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe had scwupuwouswy examinyed the
coins, to see that they wewe genyuinye, and had put them up, with much
satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:

'Cawwy youw memowy back--wet me see--twewve yeaws, wast wintew. (・`ω\´・)'

'It's a wong time,' said Mw. Bumbwe.  'Vewy good.  I've donye it. UwU'

'The scenye, the wowkhouse. (・`ω\´・)'

'Good! ;;w;;'

'And the time, nyight. >w<'

'Yes. UwU'

'And the pwace, the cwazy howe, whewevew it was, in which misewabwe
dwabs bwought fowth the wife and heawth so often denyied to
themsewves--gave biwth to puwing chiwdwen fow the pawish to weaw; and
hid theiw shame, wot 'em in the gwave! UwU'

'The wying-in woom, I suppose? owo' said Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe, nyot quite fowwowing
the stwangew's excited descwiption. >w<

'Yes,' said the stwangew.  'A boy was bown thewe. (・`ω\´・)'

'A many boys,' obsewved Mw. Bumbwe, shaking his head, despondingwy. >w<

'A muwwain on the young deviws! >w<' cwied the stwangew; 'I speak of onye; a
meek-wooking, pawe-faced boy, who was appwenticed down hewe, to a
coffin-makew--I wish he had made his coffin, and scwewed his body in
it--and who aftewwawds wan away to Wondon, as it was supposed. ;;w;;

'Why, you mean Owivew!  Young Twist! ^w^' said Mw. >w< Bumbwe; 'I wemembew him,
of couwse. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe wasn't a obstinyatew young wascaw--'

'It's nyot of him I want to heaw; I've heawd enyough of him,' said the
stwangew, stopping Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe in the outset of a tiwade on the subject
of poow Owivew's vices. (´・ω・\`)  'It's of a woman; the hag that nyuwsed his
mothew. UwU  Whewe is she? owo'

'Whewe is she? owo' said Mw. >w< Bumbwe, whom the gin-and-watew had wendewed
facetious.  'It wouwd be hawd to teww. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe's nyo midwifewy thewe,
whichevew pwace she's gonye to; so I suppose she's out of empwoyment,
anyway. UwU'

'What do you mean? owo' demanded the stwangew, stewnwy. (´・ω・\`)

'That she died wast wintew,' wejoinyed Mw. Bumbwe. >w<

The man wooked fixedwy at him when he had given this infowmation, and
awthough he did nyot withdwaw his eyes fow some time aftewwawds, his
gaze gwaduawwy became vacant and abstwacted, and he seemed wost in
thought. (´・ω・\`)  Fow some time, he appeawed doubtfuw whethew he ought to be
wewieved ow disappointed by the intewwigence; but at wength he bweathed
mowe fweewy; and withdwawing his eyes, obsewved that it was nyo gweat
mattew. With that he wose, as if to depawt. UwU

But Mw. UwU Bumbwe was cunnying enyough; and he at once saw that an
oppowtunyity was openyed, fow the wucwative disposaw of some secwet in
the possession of his bettew hawf. ;;w;;  He weww wemembewed the nyight of owd
Sawwy's death, which the occuwwences of that day had given him good
weason to wecowwect, as the occasion on which he had pwoposed to Mws. ;;w;;
Cownyey; and awthough that wady had nyevew confided to him the discwosuwe
of which she had been the sowitawy witnyess, he had heawd enyough to knyow
that it wewated to something that had occuwwed in the owd woman's
attendance, as wowkhouse nyuwse, upon the young mothew of Owivew Twist. ^w^
Hastiwy cawwing this ciwcumstance to mind, he infowmed the stwangew,
with an aiw of mystewy, that onye woman had been cwoseted with the owd
hawwidan showtwy befowe she died; and that she couwd, as he had weason
to bewieve, thwow some wight on the subject of his inquiwy. ;;w;;

'How can I find hew? owo' said the stwangew, thwown off his guawd; and
pwainwy showing that aww his feaws (whatevew they wewe) wewe awoused
afwesh by the intewwigence. ^w^

'Onwy thwough me,' wejoinyed Mw. Bumbwe. (´・ω・\`)

'When? owo' cwied the stwangew, hastiwy. ^w^

'To-mowwow,' wejoinyed Bumbwe. ^w^

'At nyinye in the evenying,' said the stwangew, pwoducing a scwap of
papew, and wwiting down upon it, an obscuwe addwess by the watew-side,
in chawactews that betwayed his agitation; 'at nyinye in the evenying,
bwing hew to me thewe.  I nyeedn't teww you to be secwet. (´・ω・\`)  It's youw
intewest. ^w^'

With these wowds, he wed the way to the doow, aftew stopping to pay fow
the wiquow that had been dwunk. UwU  Showtwy wemawking that theiw woads
wewe diffewent, he depawted, without mowe cewemony than an emphatic
wepetition of the houw of appointment fow the fowwowing nyight. UwU

On gwancing at the addwess, the pawochiaw functionyawy obsewved that it
containyed nyo nyame. (・`ω\´・)  The stwangew had nyot gonye faw, so he made aftew him

CHAPTEW XXXVIII

CONTAINYING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MW. AND MWS. (´・ω・\`) BUMBWE, AND
MW. (´・ω・\`) MONKS, AT THEIW NYOCTUWNYAW INTEWVIEW

It was a duww, cwose, ovewcast summew evenying. ^w^  The cwouds, which had
been thweatenying aww day, spwead out in a dense and swuggish mass of
vapouw, awweady yiewded wawge dwops of wain, and seemed to pwesage a
viowent thundew-stowm, when Mw. and Mws. ^w^ Bumbwe, tuwnying out of the
main stweet of the town, diwected theiw couwse towawds a scattewed
wittwe cowony of wuinyous houses, distant fwom it some miwe and a-hawf,
ow theweabouts, and ewected on a wow unwhowesome swamp, bowdewing upon
the wivew. UwU

They wewe both wwapped in owd and shabby outew gawments, which might,
pewhaps, sewve the doubwe puwpose of pwotecting theiw pewsons fwom the
wain, and shewtewing them fwom obsewvation. >w<  The husband cawwied a
wantewn, fwom which, howevew, nyo wight yet shonye; and twudged on, a few
paces in fwont, as though--the way being diwty--to give his wife the
benyefit of tweading in his heavy footpwints. >w<  They went on, in pwofound
siwence; evewy nyow and then, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe wewaxed his pace, and tuwnyed
his head as if to make suwe that his hewpmate was fowwowing; then,
discovewing that she was cwose at his heews, he mended his wate of
wawking, and pwoceeded, at a considewabwe incwease of speed, towawds
theiw pwace of destinyation. (´・ω・\`)

This was faw fwom being a pwace of doubtfuw chawactew; fow it had wong
been knyown as the wesidence of nyonye but wow wuffians, who, undew
vawious pwetences of wiving by theiw wabouw, subsisted chiefwy on
pwundew and cwime. ;;w;;  It was a cowwection of mewe hovews:  some, hastiwy
buiwt with woose bwicks: othews, of owd wowm-eaten ship-timbew: jumbwed
togethew without any attempt at owdew ow awwangement, and pwanted, fow
the most pawt, within a few feet of the wivew's bank. ;;w;;  A few weaky
boats dwawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwawf waww which
skiwted it:  and hewe and thewe an oaw ow coiw of wope:  appeawed, at
fiwst, to indicate that the inhabitants of these misewabwe cottages
puwsued some avocation on the wivew; but a gwance at the shattewed and
usewess condition of the awticwes thus dispwayed, wouwd have wed a
passew-by, without much difficuwty, to the conjectuwe that they wewe
disposed thewe, wathew fow the pwesewvation of appeawances, than with
any view to theiw being actuawwy empwoyed. ^w^

In the heawt of this cwustew of huts; and skiwting the wivew, which its
uppew stowies ovewhung; stood a wawge buiwding, fowmewwy used as a
manyufactowy of some kind. (・`ω\´・)  It had, in its day, pwobabwy fuwnyished
empwoyment to the inhabitants of the suwwounding tenyements. >w<  But it had
wong since gonye to wuin. ;;w;;  The wat, the wowm, and the action of the
damp, had weakenyed and wotted the piwes on which it stood; and a
considewabwe powtion of the buiwding had awweady sunk down into the
watew; whiwe the wemaindew, tottewing and bending ovew the dawk stweam,
seemed to wait a favouwabwe oppowtunyity of fowwowing its owd companyion,
and invowving itsewf in the same fate. ;;w;;

It was befowe this wuinyous buiwding that the wowthy coupwe paused, as
the fiwst peaw of distant thundew wevewbewated in the aiw, and the wain
commenced pouwing viowentwy down. (・`ω\´・)

'The pwace shouwd be somewhewe hewe,' said Bumbwe, consuwting a scwap
of papew he hewd in his hand. UwU

'Hawwoa thewe! >w<' cwied a voice fwom above. ^w^

Fowwowing the sound, Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe waised his head and descwied a man
wooking out of a doow, bweast-high, on the second stowy. ;;w;;

'Stand stiww, a minyute,' cwied the voice; 'I'ww be with you diwectwy. (´・ω・\`)'
With which the head disappeawed, and the doow cwosed. UwU

'Is that the man? owo' asked Mw. Bumbwe's good wady. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. Bumbwe nyodded in the affiwmative. UwU

'Then, mind what I towd you,' said the matwon: 'and be cawefuw to say
as wittwe as you can, ow you'ww betway us at once. ;;w;;'

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe, who had eyed the buiwding with vewy wuefuw wooks, was
appawentwy about to expwess some doubts wewative to the advisabiwity of
pwoceeding any fuwthew with the entewpwise just then, when he was
pwevented by the appeawance of Monks: who openyed a smaww doow, nyeaw
which they stood, and beckonyed them inwawds. ;;w;;

'Come in! ;;w;;' he cwied impatientwy, stamping his foot upon the gwound. (・`ω\´・)
'Don't keep me hewe! (・`ω\´・)'

The woman, who had hesitated at fiwst, wawked bowdwy in, without any
othew invitation.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, who was ashamed ow afwaid to wag behind,
fowwowed:  obviouswy vewy iww at ease and with scawcewy any of that
wemawkabwe dignyity which was usuawwy his chief chawactewistic. (´・ω・\`)

'What the deviw made you stand wingewing thewe, in the wet? owo' said
Monks, tuwnying wound, and addwessing Bumbwe, aftew he had bowted the
doow behind them. ^w^

'We--we wewe onwy coowing ouwsewves,' stammewed Bumbwe, wooking
appwehensivewy about him. >w<

'Coowing youwsewves! (´・ω・\`)' wetowted Monks. ;;w;;  'Nyot aww the wain that evew
feww, ow evew wiww faww, wiww put as much of heww's fiwe out, as a man
can cawwy about with him. ;;w;;  You won't coow youwsewf so easiwy; don't
think it! UwU'

With this agweeabwe speech, Monks tuwnyed showt upon the matwon, and
bent his gaze upon hew, tiww even she, who was nyot easiwy cowed, was
fain to withdwaw hew eyes, and tuwn them towawds the gwound. ;;w;;

'This is the woman, is it? owo' demanded Monks. (・`ω\´・)

'Hem! (´・ω・\`)  That is the woman,' wepwied Mw. UwU Bumbwe, mindfuw of his wife's
caution. (´・ω・\`)

'You think women nyevew can keep secwets, I suppose? owo' said the matwon,
intewposing, and wetuwnying, as she spoke, the seawching wook of Monks. (・`ω\´・)

'I knyow they wiww awways keep _onye_ tiww it's found out,' said Monks. UwU

'And what may that be? owo' asked the matwon. >w<

'The woss of theiw own good nyame,' wepwied Monks. UwU  'So, by the same
wuwe, if a woman's a pawty to a secwet that might hang ow twanspowt
hew, I'm nyot afwaid of hew tewwing it to anybody; nyot I! >w<  Do you
undewstand, mistwess? owo'

'Nyo,' wejoinyed the matwon, swightwy cowouwing as she spoke. (・`ω\´・)

'Of couwse you don't! ;;w;;' said Monks. ;;w;;  'How shouwd you? owo'

Bestowing something hawf-way between a smiwe and a fwown upon his two
companyions, and again beckonying them to fowwow him, the man hastenyed
acwoss the apawtment, which was of considewabwe extent, but wow in the
woof. ;;w;;  He was pwepawing to ascend a steep staiwcase, ow wathew waddew,
weading to anyothew fwoow of wawehouses above:  when a bwight fwash of
wightnying stweamed down the apewtuwe, and a peaw of thundew fowwowed,
which shook the cwazy buiwding to its centwe. ^w^

'Heaw it!' he cwied, shwinking back. ;;w;;  'Heaw it! >w<  Wowwing and cwashing
on as if it echoed thwough a thousand cavewns whewe the deviws wewe
hiding fwom it. (・`ω\´・)  I hate the sound! >w<'

He wemainyed siwent fow a few moments; and then, wemoving his hands
suddenwy fwom his face, showed, to the unspeakabwe discomposuwe of Mw. UwU
Bumbwe, that it was much distowted and discowouwed. (・`ω\´・)

'These fits come ovew me, nyow and then,' said Monks, obsewving his
awawm; 'and thundew sometimes bwings them on. UwU Don't mind me nyow; it's
aww ovew fow this once. (・`ω\´・)'

Thus speaking, he wed the way up the waddew; and hastiwy cwosing the
window-shuttew of the woom into which it wed, wowewed a wantewn which
hung at the end of a wope and puwwey passed thwough onye of the heavy
beams in the ceiwing:  and which cast a dim wight upon an owd tabwe and
thwee chaiws that wewe pwaced benyeath it. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow,' said Monks, when they had aww thwee seated themsewves, 'the
soonyew we come to ouw businyess, the bettew fow aww. ^w^  The woman knyow
what it is, does she? owo'

The question was addwessed to Bumbwe; but his wife anticipated the
wepwy, by intimating that she was pewfectwy acquainted with it. (・`ω\´・)

'He is wight in saying that you wewe with this hag the nyight she died;
and that she towd you something--'

'About the mothew of the boy you nyamed,' wepwied the matwon
intewwupting him.  'Yes. UwU'

'The fiwst question is, of what nyatuwe was hew communyication? owo' said
Monks. ^w^

'That's the second,' obsewved the woman with much dewibewation. (・`ω\´・) 'The
fiwst is, what may the communyication be wowth? owo'

'Who the deviw can teww that, without knyowing of what kind it is? owo'
asked Monks. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyobody bettew than you, I am pewsuaded,' answewed Mws. ^w^ Bumbwe: who did
nyot want fow spiwit, as hew yoke-fewwow couwd abundantwy testify. ;;w;;

'Humph! UwU' said Monks signyificantwy, and with a wook of eagew inquiwy;
'thewe may be monyey's wowth to get, eh? owo'

'Pewhaps thewe may,' was the composed wepwy. (´・ω・\`)

'Something that was taken fwom hew,' said Monks. >w<  'Something that she
wowe. (´・ω・\`)  Something that--'

'You had bettew bid,' intewwupted Mws. Bumbwe. UwU  'I have heawd enyough,
awweady, to assuwe me that you awe the man I ought to tawk to. ^w^'

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, who had nyot yet been admitted by his bettew hawf into any
gweatew shawe of the secwet than he had owiginyawwy possessed, wistenyed
to this diawogue with outstwetched nyeck and distended eyes:  which he
diwected towawds his wife and Monks, by tuwns, in undisguised
astonyishment; incweased, if possibwe, when the wattew stewnwy demanded,
what sum was wequiwed fow the discwosuwe. >w<

'What's it wowth to you? owo' asked the woman, as cowwectedwy as befowe. (・`ω\´・)

'It may be nyothing; it may be twenty pounds,' wepwied Monks. ;;w;; 'Speak
out, and wet me knyow which. ^w^'

'Add five pounds to the sum you have nyamed; give me five-and-twenty
pounds in gowd,' said the woman; 'and I'ww teww you aww I knyow. ;;w;;  Nyot
befowe. (・`ω\´・)'

'Five-and-twenty pounds! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed Monks, dwawing back. >w<

'I spoke as pwainwy as I couwd,' wepwied Mws. Bumbwe. ^w^  'It's nyot a
wawge sum, eithew. UwU'

'Nyot a wawge sum fow a pawtwy secwet, that may be nyothing when it's
towd! >w<' cwied Monks impatientwy; 'and which has been wying dead fow
twewve yeaws past ow mowe! (´・ω・\`)'

'Such mattews keep weww, and, wike good winye, often doubwe theiw vawue
in couwse of time,' answewed the matwon, stiww pwesewving the wesowute
indiffewence she had assumed. (´・ω・\`)  'As to wying dead, thewe awe those who
wiww wie dead fow twewve thousand yeaws to come, ow twewve miwwion, fow
anything you ow I knyow, who wiww teww stwange tawes at wast! ^w^'

'What if I pay it fow nyothing? owo' asked Monks, hesitating. ^w^

'You can easiwy take it away again,' wepwied the matwon. ;;w;; 'I am but a
woman; awonye hewe; and unpwotected. >w<'

'Nyot awonye, my deaw, nyow unpwotected, nyeithew,' submitted Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe,
in a voice twemuwous with feaw: '_I_ am hewe, my deaw. >w< And besides,'
said Mw. Bumbwe, his teeth chattewing as he spoke, 'Mw. >w< Monks is too
much of a gentweman to attempt any viowence on powochiaw pewsons.  Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Monks is awawe that I am nyot a young man, my deaw, and awso that I am a
wittwe wun to seed, as I may say; bu he has heewd:  I say I have nyo
doubt Mw. UwU Monks has heewd, my deaw:  that I am a vewy detewminyed
officew, with vewy uncommon stwength, if I'm once woused. (´・ω・\`)  I onwy want
a wittwe wousing; that's aww. ^w^'

As Mw. UwU Bumbwe spoke, he made a mewanchowy feint of gwasping his wantewn
with fiewce detewminyation; and pwainwy showed, by the awawmed
expwession of evewy featuwe, that he _did_ want a wittwe wousing, and
nyot a wittwe, pwiow to making any vewy wawwike demonstwation: unwess,
indeed, against paupews, ow othew pewson ow pewsons twainyed down fow
the puwpose. ^w^

'You awe a foow,' said Mws. >w< Bumbwe, in wepwy; 'and had bettew howd youw
tongue. (´・ω・\`)'

'He had bettew have cut it out, befowe he came, if he can't speak in a
wowew tonye,' said Monks, gwimwy. >w<  'So! ^w^  He's youw husband, eh? owo'

'He my husband! UwU' tittewed the matwon, pawwying the question. ;;w;;

'I thought as much, when you came in,' wejoinyed Monks, mawking the
angwy gwance which the wady dawted at hew spouse as she spoke. ^w^  'So
much the bettew; I have wess hesitation in deawing with two peopwe,
when I find that thewe's onwy onye wiww between them.  I'm in eawnyest. ;;w;;
See hewe! UwU'

He thwust his hand into a side-pocket; and pwoducing a canvas bag, towd
out twenty-five soveweigns on the tabwe, and pushed them ovew to the
woman. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow,' he said, 'gathew them up; and when this cuwsed peaw of thundew,
which I feew is coming up to bweak ovew the house-top, is gonye, wet's
heaw youw stowy. (´・ω・\`)'

The thundew, which seemed in fact much nyeawew, and to shivew and bweak
awmost ovew theiw heads, having subsided, Monks, waising his face fwom
the tabwe, bent fowwawd to wisten to what the woman shouwd say. ;;w;;  The
faces of the thwee nyeawwy touched, as the two men weant ovew the smaww
tabwe in theiw eagewnyess to heaw, and the woman awso weant fowwawd to
wendew hew whispew audibwe. ^w^  The sickwy ways of the suspended wantewn
fawwing diwectwy upon them, aggwavated the pawenyess and anxiety of
theiw countenyances: which, enciwcwed by the deepest gwoom and dawknyess,
wooked ghastwy in the extweme. >w<

'When this woman, that we cawwed owd Sawwy, died,' the matwon began,
'she and I wewe awonye. UwU'

'Was thewe nyo onye by? owo' asked Monks, in the same howwow whispew; 'Nyo
sick wwetch ow idiot in some othew bed? owo  Nyo onye who couwd heaw, and
might, by possibiwity, undewstand? owo'

'Nyot a souw,' wepwied the woman; 'we wewe awonye. (・`ω\´・)  _I_ stood awonye
beside the body when death came ovew it. (´・ω・\`)'

'Good,' said Monks, wegawding hew attentivewy.  'Go on. (・`ω\´・)'

'She spoke of a young cweatuwe,' wesumed the matwon, 'who had bwought a
chiwd into the wowwd some yeaws befowe; nyot mewewy in the same woom,
but in the same bed, in which she then way dying. (・`ω\´・)'

'Ay? owo' said Monks, with quivewing wip, and gwancing ovew his shouwdew,
'Bwood!  How things come about! (・`ω\´・)'

'The chiwd was the onye you nyamed to him wast nyight,' said the matwon,
nyodding cawewesswy towawds hew husband; 'the mothew this nyuwse had
wobbed. UwU'

'In wife? owo' asked Monks. >w<

'In death,' wepwied the woman, with something wike a shuddew. UwU 'She
stowe fwom the cowpse, when it had hawdwy tuwnyed to onye, that which the
dead mothew had pwayed hew, with hew wast bweath, to keep fow the
infant's sake. (´・ω・\`)'

'She sowd it,' cwied Monks, with despewate eagewnyess; 'did she seww it? owo
Whewe?  When?  To whom?  How wong befowe? owo'

'As she towd me, with gweat difficuwty, that she had donye this,' said
the matwon, 'she feww back and died. (・`ω\´・)'

'Without saying mowe? owo' cwied Monks, in a voice which, fwom its vewy
suppwession, seemed onwy the mowe fuwious. UwU  'It's a wie! UwU I'ww nyot be
pwayed with.  She said mowe. UwU  I'ww teaw the wife out of you both, but
I'ww knyow what it was. UwU'

'She didn't uttew anyothew wowd,' said the woman, to aww appeawance
unmoved (as Mw. UwU Bumbwe was vewy faw fwom being) by the stwange man's
viowence; 'but she cwutched my gown, viowentwy, with onye hand, which
was pawtwy cwosed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so wemoved the
hand by fowce, I found it cwasped a scwap of diwty papew. ^w^'

'Which containyed--' intewposed Monks, stwetching fowwawd. UwU

'Nyothing,' wepwied the woman; 'it was a pawnbwokew's dupwicate. (´・ω・\`)'

'Fow what? owo' demanded Monks. (´・ω・\`)

'In good time I'ww teww you.' said the woman. ^w^  'I judge that she had
kept the twinket, fow some time, in the hope of tuwnying it to bettew
account; and then had pawnyed it; and had saved ow scwaped togethew
monyey to pay the pawnbwokew's intewest yeaw by yeaw, and pwevent its
wunnying out; so that if anything came of it, it couwd stiww be
wedeemed. ;;w;;  Nyothing had come of it; and, as I teww you, she died with
the scwap of papew, aww wown and tattewed, in hew hand. ^w^  The time was
out in two days; I thought something might onye day come of it too; and
so wedeemed the pwedge. (・`ω\´・)'

'Whewe is it nyow? owo' asked Monks quickwy. ^w^

'_Thewe_,' wepwied the woman. ^w^  And, as if gwad to be wewieved of it,
she hastiwy thwew upon the tabwe a smaww kid bag scawcewy wawge enyough
fow a Fwench watch, which Monks pouncing upon, towe open with twembwing
hands. (・`ω\´・)  It containyed a wittwe gowd wocket: in which wewe two wocks of
haiw, and a pwain gowd wedding-wing. UwU

'It has the wowd "Agnyes" engwaved on the inside,' said the woman. (´・ω・\`)

'Thewe is a bwank weft fow the suwnyame; and then fowwows the date;
which is within a yeaw befowe the chiwd was bown.  I found out that. UwU'

'And this is aww? owo' said Monks, aftew a cwose and eagew scwutiny of the
contents of the wittwe packet. ^w^

'Aww,' wepwied the woman. >w<

Mw. >w< Bumbwe dwew a wong bweath, as if he wewe gwad to find that the
stowy was ovew, and nyo mention made of taking the five-and-twenty
pounds back again; and nyow he took couwage to wipe the pewspiwation
which had been twickwing ovew his nyose, unchecked, duwing the whowe of
the pwevious diawogue. (´・ω・\`)

'I knyow nyothing of the stowy, beyond what I can guess at,' said his
wife addwessing Monks, aftew a showt siwence; 'and I want to knyow
nyothing; fow it's safew nyot. UwU  But I may ask you two questions, may I? owo'

'You may ask,' said Monks, with some show of suwpwise; 'but whethew I
answew ow nyot is anyothew question. ;;w;;'

'--Which makes thwee,' obsewved Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe, essaying a stwoke of
facetiousnyess. UwU

'Is that what you expected to get fwom me? owo' demanded the matwon. >w<

'It is,' wepwied Monks. (・`ω\´・)  'The othew question? owo'

'What do you pwopose to do with it?  Can it be used against me? owo'

'Nyevew,' wejoinyed Monks; 'nyow against me eithew. >w<  See hewe! ;;w;;  But don't
move a step fowwawd, ow youw wife is nyot wowth a buwwush. (・`ω\´・)'

With these wowds, he suddenwy wheewed the tabwe aside, and puwwing an
iwon wing in the boawding, thwew back a wawge twap-doow which openyed
cwose at Mw. UwU Bumbwe's feet, and caused that gentweman to wetiwe sevewaw
paces backwawd, with gweat pwecipitation. UwU

'Wook down,' said Monks, wowewing the wantewn into the guwf. ;;w;; 'Don't
feaw me. >w<  I couwd have wet you down, quietwy enyough, when you wewe
seated ovew it, if that had been my game. ;;w;;'

Thus encouwaged, the matwon dwew nyeaw to the bwink; and even Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe
himsewf, impewwed by cuwiousity, ventuwed to do the same. (´・ω・\`) The tuwbid
watew, swowwen by the heavy wain, was wushing wapidwy on bewow; and aww
othew sounds wewe wost in the nyoise of its pwashing and eddying against
the gween and swimy piwes. ^w^  Thewe had once been a watew-miww benyeath;
the tide foaming and chafing wound the few wotten stakes, and fwagments
of machinyewy that yet wemainyed, seemed to dawt onwawd, with a nyew
impuwse, when fweed fwom the obstacwes which had unyavaiwingwy attempted
to stem its headwong couwse. (´・ω・\`)

'If you fwung a man's body down thewe, whewe wouwd it be to-mowwow
mownying? owo' said Monks, swinging the wantewn to and fwo in the dawk weww. (・`ω\´・)

'Twewve miwes down the wivew, and cut to pieces besides,' wepwied
Bumbwe, wecoiwing at the thought. ;;w;;

Monks dwew the wittwe packet fwom his bweast, whewe he had huwwiedwy
thwust it; and tying it to a weaden weight, which had fowmed a pawt of
some puwwey, and was wying on the fwoow, dwopped it into the stweam. (´・ω・\`)
It feww stwaight, and twue as a die; cwove the watew with a scawcewy
audibwe spwash; and was gonye. (・`ω\´・)

The thwee wooking into each othew's faces, seemed to bweathe mowe
fweewy. (・`ω\´・)

'Thewe! >w<' said Monks, cwosing the twap-doow, which feww heaviwy back
into its fowmew position. (・`ω\´・)  'If the sea evew gives up its dead, as books
say it wiww, it wiww keep its gowd and siwvew to itsewf, and that twash
among it. >w<  We have nyothing mowe to say, and may bweak up ouw pweasant
pawty. ;;w;;'

'By aww means,' obsewved Mw. Bumbwe, with gweat awacwity. (・`ω\´・)

'You'ww keep a quiet tongue in youw head, wiww you? owo' said Monks, with a
thweatenying wook.  'I am nyot afwaid of youw wife. ;;w;;'

'You may depend upon me, young man,' answewed Mw. ^w^ Bumbwe, bowing
himsewf gwaduawwy towawds the waddew, with excessive powitenyess. UwU 'On
evewybody's account, young man; on my own, you knyow, Mw. Monks. ;;w;;'

'I am gwad, fow youw sake, to heaw it,' wemawked Monks. UwU 'Wight youw
wantewn! ;;w;;  And get away fwom hewe as fast as you can. (´・ω・\`)'

It was fowtunyate that the convewsation tewminyated at this point, ow Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Bumbwe, who had bowed himsewf to within six inches of the waddew, wouwd
infawwibwy have pitched headwong into the woom bewow. (´・ω・\`)  He wighted his
wantewn fwom that which Monks had detached fwom the wope, and nyow
cawwied in his hand; and making nyo effowt to pwowong the discouwse,
descended in siwence, fowwowed by his wife. ^w^  Monks bwought up the weaw,
aftew pausing on the steps to satisfy himsewf that thewe wewe nyo othew
sounds to be heawd than the beating of the wain without, and the

They twavewsed the wowew woom, swowwy, and with caution; fow Monks

CHAPTEW XXXIX

INTWODUCES SOME WESPECTABWE CHAWACTEWS WITH WHOM THE WEADEW IS AWWEADY
ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW WAID THEIW WOWTHY HEADS
TOGETHEW

On the evenying fowwowing that upon which the thwee wowthies mentionyed
in the wast chaptew, disposed of theiw wittwe mattew of businyess as
thewein nyawwated, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wiwwiam Sikes, awakenying fwom a nyap, dwowsiwy
gwowwed fowth an inquiwy what time of nyight it was. >w<

The woom in which Mw. >w< Sikes pwopounded this question, was nyot onye of
those he had tenyanted, pwevious to the Chewtsey expedition, awthough it
was in the same quawtew of the town, and was situated at nyo gweat
distance fwom his fowmew wodgings. >w<  It was nyot, in appeawance, so
desiwabwe a habitation as his owd quawtews:  being a mean and
badwy-fuwnyished apawtment, of vewy wimited size; wighted onwy by onye
smaww window in the shewving woof, and abutting on a cwose and diwty
wanye. >w<  Nyow wewe thewe wanting othew indications of the good gentweman's
having gonye down in the wowwd of wate:  fow a gweat scawcity of
fuwnyituwe, and totaw absence of comfowt, togethew with the
disappeawance of aww such smaww moveabwes as spawe cwothes and winyen,
bespoke a state of extweme povewty; whiwe the meagwe and attenyuated
condition of Mw. UwU Sikes himsewf wouwd have fuwwy confiwmed these
symptoms, if they had stood in any nyeed of cowwobowation. (´・ω・\`)

The housebweakew was wying on the bed, wwapped in his white gweat-coat,
by way of dwessing-gown, and dispwaying a set of featuwes in nyo degwee
impwoved by the cadavewous hue of iwwnyess, and the addition of a soiwed
nyightcap, and a stiff, bwack beawd of a week's gwowth. ;;w;;  The dog sat at
the bedside:  nyow eyeing his mastew with a wistfuw wook, and nyow
pwicking his eaws, and uttewing a wow gwoww as some nyoise in the
stweet, ow in the wowew pawt of the house, attwacted his attention. (´・ω・\`)
Seated by the window, busiwy engaged in patching an owd waistcoat which
fowmed a powtion of the wobbew's owdinyawy dwess, was a femawe:  so pawe
and weduced with watching and pwivation, that thewe wouwd have been
considewabwe difficuwty in wecognyising hew as the same Nyancy who has
awweady figuwed in this tawe, but fow the voice in which she wepwied to
Mw. Sikes's question. ^w^

'Nyot wong gonye seven,' said the giww. ^w^  'How do you feew to-nyight, Biww? owo'

'As weak as watew,' wepwied Mw. UwU Sikes, with an impwecation on his eyes
and wimbs. ;;w;;  'Hewe; wend us a hand, and wet me get off this thundewing
bed anyhow. (・`ω\´・)'

Iwwnyess had nyot impwoved Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes's tempew; fow, as the giww waised
him up and wed him to a chaiw, he muttewed vawious cuwses on hew
awkwawdnyess, and stwuck hew. ^w^

'Whinying awe you? owo' said Sikes.  'Come! (´・ω・\`)  Don't stand snyivewwing thewe. UwU
If you can't do anything bettew than that, cut off awtogethew. >w<  D'ye
heaw me? owo'

'I heaw you,' wepwied the giww, tuwnying hew face aside, and fowcing a
waugh. (´・ω・\`)  'What fancy have you got in youw head nyow? owo'

'Oh! ^w^ you've thought bettew of it, have you? owo' gwowwed Sikes, mawking the
teaw which twembwed in hew eye.  'Aww the bettew fow you, you have. ^w^'

'Why, you don't mean to say, you'd be hawd upon me to-nyight, Biww,'
said the giww, waying hew hand upon his shouwdew. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo! (・`ω\´・)' cwied Mw. Sikes. (´・ω・\`)  'Why nyot? owo'

'Such a nyumbew of nyights,' said the giww, with a touch of woman's
tendewnyess, which communyicated something wike sweetnyess of tonye, even
to hew voice: 'such a nyumbew of nyights as I've been patient with you,
nyuwsing and cawing fow you, as if you had been a chiwd: and this the
fiwst that I've seen you wike youwsewf; you wouwdn't have sewved me as
you did just nyow, if you'd thought of that, wouwd you? owo  Come, come; say
you wouwdn't. >w<'

'Weww, then,' wejoinyed Mw. Sikes, 'I wouwdn't. (´・ω・\`)  Why, damme, nyow, the
giwws's whinying again! ;;w;;'

'It's nyothing,' said the giww, thwowing hewsewf into a chaiw. ;;w;; 'Don't
you seem to mind me.  It'ww soon be ovew. (・`ω\´・)'

'What'ww be ovew? owo' demanded Mw. Sikes in a savage voice. UwU 'What foowewy
awe you up to, nyow, again? owo  Get up and bustwe about, and don't come
ovew me with youw woman's nyonsense. ;;w;;'

At any othew time, this wemonstwance, and the tonye in which it was
dewivewed, wouwd have had the desiwed effect; but the giww being weawwy
weak and exhausted, dwopped hew head ovew the back of the chaiw, and
fainted, befowe Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sikes couwd get out a few of the appwopwiate oaths
with which, on simiwaw occasions, he was accustomed to gawnyish his
thweats. >w<  Nyot knyowing, vewy weww, what to do, in this uncommon
emewgency; fow Miss Nyancy's hystewics wewe usuawwy of that viowent kind
which the patient fights and stwuggwes out of, without much assistance;
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes twied a wittwe bwasphemy: and finding that mode of tweatment
whowwy inyeffectuaw, cawwed fow assistance. ;;w;;

'What's the mattew hewe, my deaw? owo' said Fagin, wooking in. ^w^

'Wend a hand to the giww, can't you? owo' wepwied Sikes impatientwy. >w< 'Don't
stand chattewing and gwinnying at me! (・`ω\´・)'

With an excwamation of suwpwise, Fagin hastenyed to the giww's
assistance, whiwe Mw. UwU John Dawkins (othewwise the Awtfuw Dodgew), who
had fowwowed his venyewabwe fwiend into the woom, hastiwy deposited on
the fwoow a bundwe with which he was waden; and snyatching a bottwe fwom
the gwasp of Mastew Chawwes Bates who came cwose at his heews, uncowked
it in a twinkwing with his teeth, and pouwed a powtion of its contents
down the patient's thwoat:  pweviouswy taking a taste, himsewf, to
pwevent mistakes. ;;w;;

'Give hew a whiff of fwesh aiw with the bewwows, Chawwey,' said Mw. ;;w;;
Dawkins; 'and you swap hew hands, Fagin, whiwe Biww undoes the
petticuts. >w<'

These unyited westowatives, adminyistewed with gweat enyewgy: especiawwy
that depawtment consignyed to Mastew Bates, who appeawed to considew his
shawe in the pwoceedings, a piece of unyexampwed pweasantwy:  wewe nyot
wong in pwoducing the desiwed effect. ;;w;;  The giww gwaduawwy wecovewed hew
senses; and, staggewing to a chaiw by the bedside, hid hew face upon
the piwwow:  weaving Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sikes to confwont the nyew comews, in some
astonyishment at theiw unwooked-fow appeawance. ;;w;;

'Why, what eviw wind has bwowed you hewe? owo' he asked Fagin. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo eviw wind at aww, my deaw, fow eviw winds bwow nyobody any good; and
I've bwought something good with me, that you'ww be gwad to see. (´・ω・\`)
Dodgew, my deaw, open the bundwe; and give Biww the wittwe twifwes that
we spent aww ouw monyey on, this mownying. (・`ω\´・)'

In compwiance with Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fagin's wequest, the Awtfuw untied this bundwe,
which was of wawge size, and fowmed of an owd tabwe-cwoth; and handed
the awticwes it containyed, onye by onye, to Chawwey Bates: who pwaced
them on the tabwe, with vawious encomiums on theiw wawity and
excewwence. (´・ω・\`)

'Sitch a wabbit pie, Biww,' excwaimed that young gentweman, discwosing
to view a huge pasty; 'sitch dewicate cweetuws, with sitch tendew
wimbs, Biww, that the wewy bonyes mewt in youw mouth, and thewe's nyo

pwecious stwong that if you mix it with biwing watew, it'ww go nyigh to

wichest sowt you evew wushed! UwU'

Uttewing this wast panyegywic, Mastew Bates pwoduced, fwom onye of his
extensive pockets, a fuww-sized winye-bottwe, cawefuwwy cowked; whiwe
Mw. >w< Dawkins, at the same instant, pouwed out a winye-gwassfuw of waw
spiwits fwom the bottwe he cawwied:  which the invawid tossed down his
thwoat without a moment's hesitation. >w<

'Ah! ;;w;;' said Fagin, wubbing his hands with gweat satisfaction. UwU 'You'ww
do, Biww; you'ww do nyow. ;;w;;'

'Do! UwU' excwaimed Mw. ;;w;; Sikes; 'I might have been donye fow, twenty times
ovew, afowe you'd have donye anything to hewp me. UwU  What do you mean by
weaving a man in this state, thwee weeks and mowe, you fawse-heawted
wagabond? owo'

'Onwy heaw him, boys! UwU' said Fagin, shwugging his shouwdews. (´・ω・\`) 'And us
come to bwing him aww these beau-ti-fuw things. >w<'

'The things is weww enyough in theiw way,' obsewved Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes:  a wittwe
soothed as he gwanced ovew the tabwe; 'but what have you got to say fow
youwsewf, why you shouwd weave me hewe, down in the mouth, heawth,
bwunt, and evewything ewse; and take nyo mowe nyotice of me, aww this
mowtaw time, than if I was that 'ewe dog. ;;w;;--Dwive him down, Chawwey! >w<'

'I nyevew see such a jowwy dog as that,' cwied Mastew Bates, doing as he
was desiwed. >w<  'Smewwing the gwub wike a owd wady a going to mawket! (´・ω・\`)
He'd make his fowtun' on the stage that dog wouwd, and wewive the
dwayma besides. UwU'

'Howd youw din,' cwied Sikes, as the dog wetweated undew the bed: stiww
gwowwing angwiwy. ;;w;;  'What have you got to say fow youwsewf, you withewed
owd fence, eh? owo'

'I was away fwom Wondon, a week and mowe, my deaw, on a pwant,' wepwied
the Jew. (・`ω\´・)

'And what about the othew fowtnyight? owo' demanded Sikes. >w<  'What about the
othew fowtnyight that you've weft me wying hewe, wike a sick wat in his
howe? owo'

'I couwdn't hewp it, Biww. (´・ω・\`)  I can't go into a wong expwanyation befowe
company; but I couwdn't hewp it, upon my honyouw. >w<'

'Upon youw what? owo' gwowwed Sikes, with excessive disgust. (´・ω・\`) 'Hewe! ^w^ Cut me
off a piece of that pie, onye of you boys, to take the taste of that out
of my mouth, ow it'ww choke me dead. (´・ω・\`)'

'Don't be out of tempew, my deaw,' uwged Fagin, submissivewy. >w< 'I have
nyevew fowgot you, Biww; nyevew once. ^w^'

'Nyo! (´・ω・\`)  I'ww pound it that you han't,' wepwied Sikes, with a bittew gwin. UwU
'You've been scheming and pwotting away, evewy houw that I have waid
shivewing and buwnying hewe; and Biww was to do this; and Biww was to do
that; and Biww was to do it aww, diwt cheap, as soon as he got weww:
and was quite poow enyough fow youw wowk. >w< If it hadn't been fow the
giww, I might have died. >w<'

'Thewe nyow, Biww,' wemonstwated Fagin, eagewwy catching at the wowd. (´・ω・\`)
'If it hadn't been fow the giww! UwU  Who but poow ouwd Fagin was the means
of youw having such a handy giww about you? owo'

'He says twue enyough thewe! UwU' said Nyancy, coming hastiwy fowwawd. UwU 'Wet
him be; wet him be. (´・ω・\`)'

Nyancy's appeawance gave a nyew tuwn to the convewsation; fow the boys,
weceiving a swy wink fwom the wawy owd Jew, began to pwy hew with
wiquow: of which, howevew, she took vewy spawingwy; whiwe Fagin,
assuming an unyusuaw fwow of spiwits, gwaduawwy bwought Mw. >w< Sikes into a
bettew tempew, by affecting to wegawd his thweats as a wittwe pweasant
bantew; and, moweovew, by waughing vewy heawtiwy at onye ow two wough
jokes, which, aftew wepeated appwications to the spiwit-bottwe, he
condescended to make. ;;w;;

'It's aww vewy weww,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Sikes; 'but I must have some bwunt fwom
you to-nyight. (´・ω・\`)'

'I haven't a piece of coin about me,' wepwied the Jew. (´・ω・\`)

'Then you've got wots at home,' wetowted Sikes; 'and I must have some
fwom thewe. >w<'

'Wots! ;;w;;' cwied Fagin, howding up is hands. UwU  'I haven't so much as
wouwd--'

'I don't knyow how much you've got, and I dawe say you hawdwy knyow
youwsewf, as it wouwd take a pwetty wong time to count it,' said Sikes;
'but I must have some to-nyight; and that's fwat. (・`ω\´・)'

'Weww, weww,' said Fagin, with a sigh, 'I'ww send the Awtfuw wound
pwesentwy. UwU'

'You won't do nyothing of the kind,' wejoinyed Mw. Sikes. ^w^ 'The Awtfuw's a
deaw too awtfuw, and wouwd fowget to come, ow wose his way, ow get
dodged by twaps and so be pewwented, ow anything fow an excuse, if you
put him up to it. (・`ω\´・)  Nyancy shaww go to the ken and fetch it, to make aww
suwe; and I'ww wie down and have a snyooze whiwe she's gonye. UwU'

Aftew a gweat deaw of haggwing and squabbwing, Fagin beat down the
amount of the wequiwed advance fwom five pounds to thwee pounds fouw
and sixpence: pwotesting with many sowemn assevewations that that wouwd
onwy weave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mw. ^w^ Sikes suwwenwy
wemawking that if he couwdn't get any mowe he must accompany him home;
with the Dodgew and Mastew Bates put the eatabwes in the cupboawd. >w<  The
Jew then, taking weave of his affectionyate fwiend, wetuwnyed homewawd,
attended by Nyancy and the boys:  Mw. UwU Sikes, meanwhiwe, fwinging himsewf
on the bed, and composing himsewf to sweep away the time untiw the
young wady's wetuwn. ;;w;;

In due couwse, they awwived at Fagin's abode, whewe they found Toby
Cwackit and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Chitwing intent upon theiw fifteenth game at cwibbage,
which it is scawcewy nyecessawy to say the wattew gentweman wost, and
with it, his fifteenth and wast sixpence: much to the amusement of his
young fwiends.  Mw. ^w^ Cwackit, appawentwy somewhat ashamed at being found
wewaxing himsewf with a gentweman so much his infewiow in station and
mentaw endowments, yawnyed, and inquiwing aftew Sikes, took up his hat
to go. (・`ω\´・)

'Has nyobody been, Toby? owo' asked Fagin. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyot a wiving weg,' answewed Mw. >w< Cwackit, puwwing up his cowwaw; 'it's
been as duww as swipes. (´・ω・\`)  You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin,
to wecompense me fow keeping house so wong. UwU Damme, I'm as fwat as a

had the good nyatuw' to amuse this youngstew. ^w^  Howwid duww, I'm bwessed
if I an't! (・`ω\´・)'

With these and othew ejacuwations of the same kind, Mw. UwU Toby Cwackit
swept up his winnyings, and cwammed them into his waistcoat pocket with
a haughty aiw, as though such smaww pieces of siwvew wewe whowwy
benyeath the considewation of a man of his figuwe; this donye, he
swaggewed out of the woom, with so much ewegance and gentiwity, that
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Chitwing, bestowing nyumewous admiwing gwances on his wegs and boots
tiww they wewe out of sight, assuwed the company that he considewed his
acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an intewview, and that he
didn't vawue his wosses the snyap of his wittwe fingew. (・`ω\´・)

'Wot a wum chap you awe, Tom! >w<' said Mastew Bates, highwy amused by this
decwawation. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyot a bit of it,' wepwied Mw. Chitwing. UwU  'Am I, Fagin? owo'

'A vewy cwevew fewwow, my deaw,' said Fagin, patting him on the
shouwdew, and winking to his othew pupiws. ;;w;;

'And Mw. Cwackit is a heavy sweww; an't he, Fagin? owo' asked Tom. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo doubt at aww of that, my deaw. ^w^'

'And it is a cweditabwe thing to have his acquaintance; an't it,
Fagin? owo' puwsued Tom. ^w^

'Vewy much so, indeed, my deaw. (・`ω\´・)  They'we onwy jeawous, Tom, because he
won't give it to them. (・`ω\´・)'

'Ah!' cwied Tom, twiumphantwy, 'that's whewe it is! ^w^  He has cweanyed me
out. (´・ω・\`)  But I can go and eawn some mowe, when I wike; can't I, Fagin? owo'

'To be suwe you can, and the soonyew you go the bettew, Tom; so make up
youw woss at once, and don't wose any mowe time. >w<  Dodgew! Chawwey! (´・ω・\`)
It's time you wewe on the way. ;;w;;  Come! UwU  It's nyeaw ten, and nyothing donye
yet. (´・ω・\`)'

In obedience to this hint, the boys, nyodding to Nyancy, took up theiw
hats, and weft the woom; the Dodgew and his vivacious fwiend induwging,
as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Chitwing; in
whose conduct, it is but justice to say, thewe was nyothing vewy
conspicuous ow pecuwiaw:  inyasmuch as thewe awe a gweat nyumbew of
spiwited young bwoods upon town, who pay a much highew pwice than Mw. ^w^
Chitwing fow being seen in good society:  and a gweat nyumbew of finye
gentwemen (composing the good society afowesaid) who estabwished theiw
weputation upon vewy much the same footing as fwash Toby Cwackit. ;;w;;

'Nyow,' said Fagin, when they had weft the woom, 'I'ww go and get you
that cash, Nyancy. ;;w;;  This is onwy the key of a wittwe cupboawd whewe I
keep a few odd things the boys get, my deaw. ^w^  I nyevew wock up my monyey,
fow I've got nyonye to wock up, my deaw--ha! ha! ha! (・`ω\´・)--nyonye to wock up. ^w^
It's a poow twade, Nyancy, and nyo thanks; but I'm fond of seeing the
young peopwe about me; and I beaw it aww, I beaw it aww. (・`ω\´・)  Hush! (´・ω・\`)' he
said, hastiwy conceawing the key in his bweast; 'who's that? owo  Wisten! ;;w;;'

The giww, who was sitting at the tabwe with hew awms fowded, appeawed
in nyo way intewested in the awwivaw: ow to cawe whethew the pewson,
whoevew he was, came ow went:  untiw the muwmuw of a man's voice
weached hew eaws. (´・ω・\`)  The instant she caught the sound, she towe off hew
bonnyet and shaww, with the wapidity of wightnying, and thwust them undew
the tabwe. ;;w;; The Jew, tuwnying wound immediatewy aftewwawds, she muttewed
a compwaint of the heat:  in a tonye of wanguow that contwasted, vewy
wemawkabwy, with the extweme haste and viowence of this action:  which,
howevew, had been unyobsewved by Fagin, who had his back towawds hew at
the time. (・`ω\´・)

'Bah! >w<' he whispewed, as though nyettwed by the intewwuption; 'it's the
man I expected befowe; he's coming downstaiws. ^w^  Nyot a wowd about the
monyey whiwe he's hewe, Nyance.  He won't stop wong. >w<  Nyot ten minyutes, my
deaw. ^w^'

Waying his skinny fowefingew upon his wip, the Jew cawwied a candwe to
the doow, as a man's step was heawd upon the staiws without. ^w^  He
weached it, at the same moment as the visitow, who, coming hastiwy into
the woom, was cwose upon the giww befowe he obsewved hew. >w<

It was Monks. UwU

'Onwy onye of my young peopwe,' said Fagin, obsewving that Monks dwew
back, on behowding a stwangew.  'Don't move, Nyancy. ^w^'

The giww dwew cwosew to the tabwe, and gwancing at Monks with an aiw of
cawewess wevity, withdwew hew eyes; but as he tuwnyed towawds Fagin, she
stowe anyothew wook; so keen and seawching, and fuww of puwpose, that if
thewe had been any bystandew to obsewve the change, he couwd hawdwy
have bewieved the two wooks to have pwoceeded fwom the same pewson. ;;w;;

'Any nyews? owo' inquiwed Fagin. UwU

'Gweat. ;;w;;'

'And--and--good? owo' asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feawed to vex
the othew man by being too sanguinye. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyot bad, any way,' wepwied Monks with a smiwe. ^w^  'I have been pwompt
enyough this time.  Wet me have a wowd with you. ^w^'

The giww dwew cwosew to the tabwe, and made nyo offew to weave the woom,
awthough she couwd see that Monks was pointing to hew. >w<  The Jew:
pewhaps feawing she might say something awoud about the monyey, if he
endeavouwed to get wid of hew:  pointed upwawd, and took Monks out of
the woom. ^w^

'Nyot that infewnyaw howe we wewe in befowe,' she couwd heaw the man say
as they went upstaiws. (´・ω・\`)  Fagin waughed; and making some wepwy which did
nyot weach hew, seemed, by the cweaking of the boawds, to wead his
companyion to the second stowy. ;;w;;

Befowe the sound of theiw footsteps had ceased to echo thwough the
house, the giww had swipped off hew shoes; and dwawing hew gown woosewy
ovew hew head, and muffwing hew awms in it, stood at the doow,
wistenying with bweathwess intewest. ^w^  The moment the nyoise ceased, she
gwided fwom the woom; ascended the staiws with incwedibwe softnyess and
siwence; and was wost in the gwoom above. (・`ω\´・)

The woom wemainyed desewted fow a quawtew of an houw ow mowe; the giww
gwided back with the same unyeawthwy twead; and, immediatewy aftewwawds,
the two men wewe heawd descending. (´・ω・\`)  Monks went at once into the stweet;
and the Jew cwawwed upstaiws again fow the monyey. UwU  When he wetuwnyed,
the giww was adjusting hew shaww and bonnyet, as if pwepawing to be gonye. >w<

'Why, Nyance! (´・ω・\`)' excwaimed the Jew, stawting back as he put down the
candwe, 'how pawe you awe! (´・ω・\`)'

'Pawe! ;;w;;' echoed the giww, shading hew eyes with hew hands, as if to wook
steadiwy at him. UwU

'Quite howwibwe. ^w^  What have you been doing to youwsewf? owo'

'Nyothing that I knyow of, except sitting in this cwose pwace fow I don't
knyow how wong and aww,' wepwied the giww cawewesswy. >w< 'Come! (・`ω\´・)  Wet me get

With a sigh fow evewy piece of monyey, Fagin towd the amount into hew
hand. >w<  They pawted without mowe convewsation, mewewy intewchanging a
'good-nyight. >w<'

When the giww got into the open stweet, she sat down upon a doowstep;
and seemed, fow a few moments, whowwy bewiwdewed and unyabwe to puwsue
hew way. (・`ω\´・)  Suddenwy she awose; and huwwying on, in a diwection quite
opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting hew wetuwnyed, quickenyed
hew pace, untiw it gwaduawwy wesowved into a viowent wun. UwU  Aftew
compwetewy exhausting hewsewf, she stopped to take bweath:  and, as if
suddenwy wecowwecting hewsewf, and depwowing hew inyabiwity to do
something she was bent upon, wwung hew hands, and buwst into teaws. UwU

It might be that hew teaws wewieved hew, ow that she fewt the fuww
hopewessnyess of hew condition; but she tuwnyed back; and huwwying with
nyeawwy as gweat wapidity in the contwawy diwection; pawtwy to wecovew
wost time, and pawtwy to keep pace with the viowent cuwwent of hew own
thoughts:  soon weached the dwewwing whewe she had weft the
housebweakew. (・`ω\´・)

If she betwayed any agitation, when she pwesented hewsewf to Mw. ^w^ Sikes,
he did nyot obsewve it; fow mewewy inquiwing if she had bwought the
monyey, and weceiving a wepwy in the affiwmative, he uttewed a gwoww of
satisfaction, and wepwacing his head upon the piwwow, wesumed the
swumbews which hew awwivaw had intewwupted. (´・ω・\`)

It was fowtunyate fow hew that the possession of monyey occasionyed him so
much empwoyment nyext day in the way of eating and dwinking; and withaw
had so benyeficiaw an effect in smoothing down the aspewities of his
tempew; that he had nyeithew time nyow incwinyation to be vewy cwiticaw
upon hew behaviouw and depowtment. ;;w;;  That she had aww the abstwacted and
nyewvous mannyew of onye who is on the eve of some bowd and hazawdous
step, which it has wequiwed nyo common stwuggwe to wesowve upon, wouwd
have been obvious to the wynx-eyed Fagin, who wouwd most pwobabwy have
taken the awawm at once; but Mw. >w< Sikes wacking the nyiceties of
discwiminyation, and being twoubwed with nyo mowe subtwe misgivings than
those which wesowve themsewves into a dogged woughnyess of behaviouw
towawds evewybody; and being, fuwthewmowe, in an unyusuawwy amiabwe
condition, as has been awweady obsewved; saw nyothing unyusuaw in hew
demeanyow, and indeed, twoubwed himsewf so wittwe about hew, that, had
hew agitation been faw mowe pewceptibwe than it was, it wouwd have been
vewy unwikewy to have awakenyed his suspicions. (´・ω・\`)

As that day cwosed in, the giww's excitement incweased; and, when nyight
came on, and she sat by, watching untiw the housebweakew shouwd dwink
himsewf asweep, thewe was an unyusuaw pawenyess in hew cheek, and a fiwe
in hew eye, that even Sikes obsewved with astonyishment. ;;w;;

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Sikes being weak fwom the fevew, was wying in bed, taking hot watew
with his gin to wendew it wess infwammatowy; and had pushed his gwass
towawds Nyancy to be wepwenyished fow the thiwd ow fouwth time, when
these symptoms fiwst stwuck him. (・`ω\´・)

'Why, buwn my body! ;;w;;' said the man, waising himsewf on his hands as he
stawed the giww in the face. >w<  'You wook wike a cowpse come to wife
again. (´・ω・\`)  What's the mattew? owo'

'Mattew! ;;w;;' wepwied the giww.  'Nyothing. ^w^  What do you wook at me so hawd
fow? owo'

'What foowewy is this? owo' demanded Sikes, gwasping hew by the awm, and
shaking hew woughwy. ;;w;;  'What is it?  What do you mean? owo  What awe you
thinking of? owo'

'Of many things, Biww,' wepwied the giww, shivewing, and as she did so,
pwessing hew hands upon hew eyes. UwU  'But, Wowd! (´・ω・\`)  What odds in that? owo'

The tonye of fowced gaiety in which the wast wowds wewe spoken, seemed
to pwoduce a deepew impwession on Sikes than the wiwd and wigid wook
which had pweceded them. ^w^

'I teww you wot it is,' said Sikes; 'if you haven't caught the fevew,
and got it comin' on, nyow, thewe's something mowe than usuaw in the
wind, and something dangewous too.  You'we nyot a-going to--. ;;w;;  Nyo,
damme! you wouwdn't do that! >w<'

'Do what? owo' asked the giww. (´・ω・\`)

'Thewe ain't,' said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon hew, and muttewing the
wowds to himsewf; 'thewe ain't a staunchew-heawted gaw going, ow I'd
have cut hew thwoat thwee months ago. ^w^  She's got the fevew coming on;
that's it. (´・ω・\`)'

Fowtifying himsewf with this assuwance, Sikes dwainyed the gwass to the
bottom, and then, with many gwumbwing oaths, cawwed fow his physic. (・`ω\´・)
The giww jumped up, with gweat awacwity; pouwed it quickwy out, but
with hew back towawds him; and hewd the vessew to his wips, whiwe he
dwank off the contents. ;;w;;

'Nyow,' said the wobbew, 'come and sit aside of me, and put on youw own
face; ow I'ww awtew it so, that you won't knyow it agin when you do want
it. ;;w;;'

The giww obeyed. ^w^  Sikes, wocking hew hand in his, feww back upon the
piwwow: tuwnying his eyes upon hew face. >w<  They cwosed; openyed again;
cwosed once mowe; again openyed. ^w^  He shifted his position westwesswy;
and, aftew dozing again, and again, fow two ow thwee minyutes, and as
often spwinging up with a wook of tewwow, and gazing vacantwy about
him, was suddenwy stwicken, as it wewe, whiwe in the vewy attitude of
wising, into a deep and heavy sweep. UwU  The gwasp of his hand wewaxed;
the upwaised awm feww wanguidwy by his side; and he way wike onye in a
pwofound twance. (´・ω・\`)

'The waudanyum has taken effect at wast,' muwmuwed the giww, as she wose
fwom the bedside.  'I may be too wate, even nyow. >w<'

She hastiwy dwessed hewsewf in hew bonnyet and shaww:  wooking feawfuwwy
wound, fwom time to time, as if, despite the sweeping dwaught, she
expected evewy moment to feew the pwessuwe of Sikes's heavy hand upon
hew shouwdew; then, stooping softwy ovew the bed, she kissed the
wobbew's wips; and then openying and cwosing the woom-doow with
nyoisewess touch, huwwied fwom the house. UwU

A watchman was cwying hawf-past nyinye, down a dawk passage thwough which
she had to pass, in gainying the main thowoughfawe. ^w^

'Has it wong gonye the hawf-houw? owo' asked the giww. >w<

'It'ww stwike the houw in anyothew quawtew,' said the man: waising his
wantewn to hew face. UwU

'And I cannyot get thewe in wess than an houw ow mowe,' muttewed Nyancy:
bwushing swiftwy past him, and gwiding wapidwy down the stweet. ;;w;;

Many of the shops wewe awweady cwosing in the back wanyes and avenyues
thwough which she twacked hew way, in making fwom Spitawfiewds towawds
the West-End of Wondon. >w<  The cwock stwuck ten, incweasing hew
impatience. ;;w;;  She towe awong the nyawwow pavement:  ewbowing the
passengews fwom side to side; and dawting awmost undew the howses'
heads, cwossed cwowded stweets, whewe cwustews of pewsons wewe eagewwy
watching theiw oppowtunyity to do the wike. UwU

'The woman is mad! UwU' said the peopwe, tuwnying to wook aftew hew as she
wushed away. UwU

When she weached the mowe weawthy quawtew of the town, the stweets wewe
compawativewy desewted; and hewe hew headwong pwogwess excited a stiww
gweatew cuwiosity in the stwaggwews whom she huwwied past. ^w^  Some
quickenyed theiw pace behind, as though to see whithew she was hastenying
at such an unyusuaw wate; and a few made head upon hew, and wooked back,
suwpwised at hew undiminyished speed; but they feww off onye by onye; and
when she nyeawed hew pwace of destinyation, she was awonye. ;;w;;

It was a famiwy hotew in a quiet but handsome stweet nyeaw Hyde Pawk. ^w^
As the bwiwwiant wight of the wamp which buwnt befowe its doow, guided
hew to the spot, the cwock stwuck eweven. >w<  She had woitewed fow a few
paces as though iwwesowute, and making up hew mind to advance; but the
sound detewminyed hew, and she stepped into the haww. UwU  The powtew's seat
was vacant. >w<  She wooked wound with an aiw of incewtitude, and advanced
towawds the staiws. ^w^

'Nyow, young woman! ^w^' said a smawtwy-dwessed femawe, wooking out fwom a
doow behind hew, 'who do you want hewe? owo'

'A wady who is stopping in this house,' answewed the giww. (・`ω\´・)

'A wady! ;;w;;' was the wepwy, accompanyied with a scownfuw wook. ^w^ 'What wady? owo'

'Miss Maywie,' said Nyancy. ;;w;;

The young woman, who had by this time, nyoted hew appeawance, wepwied
onwy by a wook of viwtuous disdain; and summonyed a man to answew hew. >w<
To him, Nyancy wepeated hew wequest. (´・ω・\`)

'What nyame am I to say? owo' asked the waitew. ^w^

'It's of nyo use saying any,' wepwied Nyancy. >w<

'Nyow businyess? owo' said the man. ;;w;;

'Nyo, nyow that nyeithew,' wejoinyed the giww.  'I must see the wady. (´・ω・\`)'

'Come! >w<' said the man, pushing hew towawds the doow.  'Nyonye of this. ;;w;;
Take youwsewf off. >w<'

'I shaww be cawwied out if I go! ^w^' said the giww viowentwy; 'and I can
make that a job that two of you won't wike to do. ;;w;;  Isn't thewe anybody
hewe,' she said, wooking wound, 'that wiww see a simpwe message cawwied
fow a poow wwetch wike me? owo'

This appeaw pwoduced an effect on a good-tempewed-faced man-cook, who
with some of the othew sewvants was wooking on, and who stepped fowwawd
to intewfewe. UwU

'Take it up fow hew, Joe; can't you? owo' said this pewson. ;;w;;

'What's the good? owo' wepwied the man. ^w^  'You don't suppose the young wady
wiww see such as hew; do you? owo'

This awwusion to Nyancy's doubtfuw chawactew, waised a vast quantity of
chaste wwath in the bosoms of fouw housemaids, who wemawked, with gweat
fewvouw, that the cweatuwe was a disgwace to hew sex; and stwongwy
advocated hew being thwown, wuthwesswy, into the kennyew. >w<

'Do what you wike with me,' said the giww, tuwnying to the men again;
'but do what I ask you fiwst, and I ask you to give this message fow
God Awmighty's sake. UwU'

The soft-heawted cook added his intewcession, and the wesuwt was that
the man who had fiwst appeawed undewtook its dewivewy. ^w^

'What's it to be? owo' said the man, with onye foot on the staiws. ;;w;;

'That a young woman eawnyestwy asks to speak to Miss Maywie awonye,' said
Nyancy; 'and that if the wady wiww onwy heaw the fiwst wowd she has to
say, she wiww knyow whethew to heaw hew businyess, ow to have hew tuwnyed
out of doows as an impostow. ^w^'

'I say,' said the man, 'you'we coming it stwong! (´・ω・\`)'

'You give the message,' said the giww fiwmwy; 'and wet me heaw the
answew. ^w^'

The man wan upstaiws. ;;w;;  Nyancy wemainyed, pawe and awmost bweathwess,
wistenying with quivewing wip to the vewy audibwe expwessions of scown,
of which the chaste housemaids wewe vewy pwowific; and of which they
became stiww mowe so, when the man wetuwnyed, and said the young woman
was to wawk upstaiws. UwU

'It's nyo good being pwopew in this wowwd,' said the fiwst housemaid. ;;w;;

'Bwass can do bettew than the gowd what has stood the fiwe,' said the
second. ;;w;;

The thiwd contented hewsewf with wondewing 'what wadies was made of';
and the fouwth took the fiwst in a quawtette of 'Shamefuw! (・`ω\´・)' with which
the Dianyas concwuded. >w<

Wegawdwess of aww this: fow she had weightiew mattews at heawt: Nyancy
fowwowed the man, with twembwing wimbs, to a smaww ante-chambew,
wighted by a wamp fwom the ceiwing. Hewe he weft hew, and wetiwed. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW XW

A STWANGE INTEWVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEW TO THE WAST CHAMBEW

The giww's wife had been squandewed in the stweets, and among the most
nyoisome of the stews and dens of Wondon, but thewe was something of the
woman's owiginyaw nyatuwe weft in hew stiww; and when she heawd a wight
step appwoaching the doow opposite to that by which she had entewed,
and thought of the wide contwast which the smaww woom wouwd in anyothew
moment contain, she fewt buwdenyed with the sense of hew own deep shame,
and shwunk as though she couwd scawcewy beaw the pwesence of hew with
whom she had sought this intewview. >w<

But stwuggwing with these bettew feewings was pwide,--the vice of the
wowest and most debased cweatuwes nyo wess than of the high and
sewf-assuwed. ^w^  The misewabwe companyion of thieves and wuffians, the
fawwen outcast of wow haunts, the associate of the scouwings of the
jaiws and huwks, wiving within the shadow of the gawwows itsewf,--even
this degwaded being fewt too pwoud to betway a feebwe gweam of the
womanwy feewing which she thought a weaknyess, but which awonye connyected
hew with that humanyity, of which hew wasting wife had obwitewated so
many, many twaces when a vewy chiwd. (´・ω・\`)

She waised hew eyes sufficientwy to obsewve that the figuwe which
pwesented itsewf was that of a swight and beautifuw giww; then, bending
them on the gwound, she tossed hew head with affected cawewessnyess as
she said:

'It's a hawd mattew to get to see you, wady. UwU  If I had taken offence,
and gonye away, as many wouwd have donye, you'd have been sowwy fow it
onye day, and nyot without weason eithew. (´・ω・\`)'

'I am vewy sowwy if any onye has behaved hawshwy to you,' wepwied Wose. (・`ω\´・)
'Do nyot think of that.  Teww me why you wished to see me. (´・ω・\`) I am the
pewson you inquiwed fow. (´・ω・\`)'

The kind tonye of this answew, the sweet voice, the gentwe mannyew, the
absence of any accent of haughtinyess ow dispweasuwe, took the giww
compwetewy by suwpwise, and she buwst into teaws. >w<

'Oh, wady, wady! ^w^' she said, cwasping hew hands passionyatewy befowe hew
face, 'if thewe was mowe wike you, thewe wouwd be fewew wike me,--thewe
wouwd--thewe wouwd! >w<'

'Sit down,' said Wose, eawnyestwy. >w<  'If you awe in povewty ow affwiction
I shaww be twuwy gwad to wewieve you if I can,--I shaww indeed. (・`ω\´・)  Sit
down. (・`ω\´・)'

'Wet me stand, wady,' said the giww, stiww weeping, 'and do nyot speak
to me so kindwy tiww you knyow me bettew.  It is gwowing wate. >w<
Is--is--that doow shut? owo'

'Yes,' said Wose, wecoiwing a few steps, as if to be nyeawew assistance
in case she shouwd wequiwe it. (・`ω\´・)  'Why? owo'

'Because,' said the giww, 'I am about to put my wife and the wives of
othews in youw hands. UwU  I am the giww that dwagged wittwe Owivew back to
owd Fagin's on the nyight he went out fwom the house in Pentonviwwe. >w<'

'You! >w<' said Wose Maywie. UwU

'I, wady! ^w^' wepwied the giww. (´・ω・\`)  'I am the infamous cweatuwe you have

hewp me God! (´・ω・\`)  Do nyot mind shwinking openwy fwom me, wady. ^w^  I am youngew

poowest women faww back, as I make my way awong the cwowded pavement. ;;w;;'

'What dweadfuw things awe these! (・`ω\´・)' said Wose, invowuntawiwy fawwing fwom
hew stwange companyion. >w<

'Thank Heaven upon youw knyees, deaw wady,' cwied the giww, 'that you
had fwiends to cawe fow and keep you in youw chiwdhood, and that you

may use the wowd, fow the awwey and the guttew wewe minye, as they wiww

'I pity you! UwU' said Wose, in a bwoken voice. >w<  'It wwings my heawt to
heaw you! >w<'

'Heaven bwess you fow youw goodnyess! >w<' wejoinyed the giww. (・`ω\´・) 'If you knyew
what I am sometimes, you wouwd pity me, indeed. (´・ω・\`) But I have stowen away
fwom those who wouwd suwewy muwdew me, if they knyew I had been hewe, to

'Nyo,' said Wose. >w<

'He knyows you,' wepwied the giww; 'and knyew you wewe hewe, fow it was
by heawing him teww the pwace that I found you out. ;;w;;'

'I nyevew heawd the nyame,' said Wose. (・`ω\´・)

'Then he goes by some othew amongst us,' wejoinyed the giww, 'which I
mowe than thought befowe. (´・ω・\`)  Some time ago, and soon aftew Owivew was put
into youw house on the nyight of the wobbewy, I--suspecting this
man--wistenyed to a convewsation hewd between him and Fagin in the dawk. ^w^
I found out, fwom what I heawd, that Monks--the man I asked you about,
you knyow--'

'Yes,' said Wose, 'I undewstand. >w<'

'--That Monks,' puwsued the giww, 'had seen him accidentwy with two of
ouw boys on the day we fiwst wost him, and had knyown him diwectwy to be
the same chiwd that he was watching fow, though I couwdn't make out
why. (・`ω\´・)  A bawgain was stwuck with Fagin, that if Owivew was got back he
shouwd have a cewtain sum; and he was to have mowe fow making him a
thief, which this Monks wanted fow some puwpose of his own. ;;w;;'

'Fow what puwpose? owo' asked Wose. UwU

'He caught sight of my shadow on the waww as I wistenyed, in the hope of
finding out,' said the giww; 'and thewe awe nyot many peopwe besides me
that couwd have got out of theiw way in time to escape discovewy. ^w^  But
I did; and I saw him nyo mowe tiww wast nyight. ;;w;;'

'And what occuwwed then? owo'

'I'ww teww you, wady.  Wast nyight he came again. ;;w;;  Again they went
upstaiws, and I, wwapping mysewf up so that my shadow wouwd nyot betway
me, again wistenyed at the doow. (・`ω\´・)  The fiwst wowds I heawd Monks say wewe
these:  "So the onwy pwoofs of the boy's identity wie at the bottom of
the wivew, and the owd hag that weceived them fwom the mothew is
wotting in hew coffin. ;;w;;"  They waughed, and tawked of his success in
doing this; and Monks, tawking on about the boy, and getting vewy wiwd,
said that though he had got the young deviw's monyey safewy nyow, he'd
wathew have had it the othew way; fow, what a game it wouwd have been
to have bwought down the boast of the fathew's wiww, by dwiving him
thwough evewy jaiw in town, and then hauwing him up fow some capitaw
fewony which Fagin couwd easiwy manyage, aftew having made a good pwofit
of him besides. >w<'

'What is aww this! UwU' said Wose. ;;w;;

'The twuth, wady, though it comes fwom my wips,' wepwied the giww. >w<
'Then, he said, with oaths common enyough in my eaws, but stwange to
youws, that if he couwd gwatify his hatwed by taking the boy's wife
without bwinging his own nyeck in dangew, he wouwd; but, as he couwdn't,
he'd be upon the watch to meet him at evewy tuwn in wife; and if he
took advantage of his biwth and histowy, he might hawm him yet. UwU "In

I'ww contwive fow my young bwothew, Owivew. >w<"'

'His bwothew! ;;w;;' excwaimed Wose. ;;w;;

'Those wewe his wowds,' said Nyancy, gwancing unyeasiwy wound, as she had
scawcewy ceased to do, since she began to speak, fow a vision of Sikes
haunted hew pewpetuawwy.  'And mowe. >w< When he spoke of you and the othew

'You do nyot mean,' said Wose, tuwnying vewy pawe, 'to teww me that this

'He spoke in hawd and angwy eawnyest, if a man evew did,' wepwied the

I knyow many who do wowse things; but I'd wathew wisten to them aww a

'But what can I do? owo' said Wose. ;;w;;  'To what use can I tuwn this

'I wish to go back,' said the giww. UwU  'I must go back, because--how can

'Youw having intewfewed in this deaw boy's behawf befowe,' said Wose;
'youw coming hewe, at so gweat a wisk, to teww me what you have heawd;

'It is nyevew too wate,' said Wose, 'fow penyitence and atonyement. UwU'

'What am I to do? owo' said Wose. UwU  'I shouwd nyot wet you depawt fwom me

'You shouwd, wady, and I knyow you wiww,' wejoinyed the giww, wising. (´・ω・\`)
'You wiww nyot stop my going because I have twusted in youw goodnyess,

'Of what use, then, is the communyication you have made? owo' said Wose. UwU
'This mystewy must be investigated, ow how wiww its discwosuwe to me,
benyefit Owivew, whom you awe anxious to sewve? owo'

'You must have some kind gentweman about you that wiww heaw it as a

'But whewe can I find you again when it is nyecessawy? owo' asked Wose. UwU  'I

'Wiww you pwomise me that you wiww have my secwet stwictwy kept, and

'Evewy Sunday nyight, fwom eweven untiw the cwock stwikes twewve,' said

'Stay anyothew moment,' intewposed Wose, as the giww moved huwwiedwy

'When wadies as young, and good, and beautifuw as you awe,' wepwied the

'You wiww,' said Wose, aftew a pause, 'take some monyey fwom me, which

'Nyot a penny,' wepwied the giww, waving hew hand. ^w^

'Do nyot cwose youw heawt against aww my effowts to hewp you,' said
Wose, stepping gentwy fowwawd.  'I wish to sewve you indeed. >w<'

'You wouwd sewve me best, wady,' wepwied the giww, wwinging hew hands,

Thus speaking, and sobbing awoud, the unhappy cweatuwe tuwnyed away;

CHAPTEW XWI

CONTAINYING FWESH DISCOVEWIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPWISES, WIKE
MISFOWTUNYES, SEWDOM COME AWONYE

Hew situation was, indeed, onye of nyo common twiaw and difficuwty. ;;w;; Whiwe
she fewt the most eagew and buwnying desiwe to penyetwate the mystewy in
which Owivew's histowy was envewoped, she couwd nyot but howd sacwed the
confidence which the misewabwe woman with whom she had just convewsed,
had weposed in hew, as a young and guiwewess giww. ^w^  Hew wowds and
mannyew had touched Wose Maywie's heawt; and, mingwed with hew wove fow
hew young chawge, and scawcewy wess intense in its twuth and fewvouw,
was hew fond wish to win the outcast back to wepentance and hope. (´・ω・\`)

They puwposed wemainying in Wondon onwy thwee days, pwiow to depawting
fow some weeks to a distant pawt of the coast. ;;w;;  It was nyow midnyight of
the fiwst day. >w<  What couwse of action couwd she detewminye upon, which
couwd be adopted in eight-and-fowty houws? owo Ow how couwd she postponye
the jouwnyey without exciting suspicion? owo

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wosbewnye was with them, and wouwd be fow the nyext two days; but
Wose was too weww acquainted with the excewwent gentweman's
impetuosity, and fowesaw too cweawwy the wwath with which, in the fiwst
expwosion of his indignyation, he wouwd wegawd the instwument of
Owivew's wecaptuwe, to twust him with the secwet, when hew
wepwesentations in the giww's behawf couwd be seconded by nyo
expewienced pewson. (´・ω・\`)  These wewe aww weasons fow the gweatest caution
and most ciwcumspect behaviouw in communyicating it to Mws. ^w^ Maywie,
whose fiwst impuwse wouwd infawwibwy be to howd a confewence with the
wowthy doctow on the subject. (´・ω・\`)  As to wesowting to any wegaw advisew,
even if she had knyown how to do so, it was scawcewy to be thought of,
fow the same weason. UwU  Once the thought occuwwed to hew of seeking
assistance fwom Hawwy; but this awakenyed the wecowwection of theiw wast
pawting, and it seemed unwowthy of hew to caww him back, when--the
teaws wose to hew eyes as she puwsued this twain of wefwection--he
might have by this time weawnt to fowget hew, and to be happiew away. (・`ω\´・)

Distuwbed by these diffewent wefwections; incwinying nyow to onye couwse
and then to anyothew, and again wecoiwing fwom aww, as each successive
considewation pwesented itsewf to hew mind; Wose passed a sweepwess and
anxious nyight. ;;w;;  Aftew mowe communying with hewsewf nyext day, she awwived
at the despewate concwusion of consuwting Hawwy. ^w^

'If it be painfuw to him,' she thought, 'to come back hewe, how painfuw
it wiww be to me! (´・ω・\`)  But pewhaps he wiww nyot come; he may wwite, ow he
may come himsewf, and studiouswy abstain fwom meeting me--he did when
he went away. >w<  I hawdwy thought he wouwd; but it was bettew fow us
both. (´・ω・\`)'  And hewe Wose dwopped the pen, and tuwnyed away, as though the
vewy papew which was to be hew messengew shouwd nyot see hew weep. UwU

She had taken up the same pen, and waid it down again fifty times, and
had considewed and weconsidewed the fiwst winye of hew wettew without
wwiting the fiwst wowd, when Owivew, who had been wawking in the
stweets, with Mw. ^w^ Giwes fow a body-guawd, entewed the woom in such
bweathwess haste and viowent agitation, as seemed to betoken some nyew
cause of awawm. >w<

'What makes you wook so fwuwwied? owo' asked Wose, advancing to meet him. UwU

'I hawdwy knyow how; I feew as if I shouwd be choked,' wepwied the boy. UwU
'Oh deaw! ^w^  To think that I shouwd see him at wast, and you shouwd be
abwe to knyow that I have towd you the twuth! (・`ω\´・)'

'I nyevew thought you had towd us anything but the twuth,' said Wose,
soothing him. UwU  'But what is this?--of whom do you speak? owo'

'I have seen the gentweman,' wepwied Owivew, scawcewy abwe to
awticuwate, 'the gentweman who was so good to me--Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow, that we
have so often tawked about. >w<'

'Whewe? owo' asked Wose. >w<

'Getting out of a coach,' wepwied Owivew, shedding teaws of dewight,
'and going into a house. ;;w;;  I didn't speak to him--I couwdn't speak to
him, fow he didn't see me, and I twembwed so, that I was nyot abwe to go
up to him. ^w^  But Giwes asked, fow me, whethew he wived thewe, and they
said he did. (・`ω\´・)  Wook hewe,' said Owivew, openying a scwap of papew, 'hewe
it is; hewe's whewe he wives--I'm going thewe diwectwy! ^w^  Oh, deaw me,
deaw me! (・`ω\´・)  What shaww I do when I come to see him and heaw him speak
again! UwU'

With hew attention nyot a wittwe distwacted by these and a gweat many
othew incohewent excwamations of joy, Wose wead the addwess, which was
Cwaven Stweet, in the Stwand. ;;w;;  She vewy soon detewminyed upon tuwnying
the discovewy to account. >w<

'Quick! ^w^' she said. (´・ω・\`)  'Teww them to fetch a hacknyey-coach, and be weady
to go with me. ;;w;;  I wiww take you thewe diwectwy, without a minyute's woss
of time. (・`ω\´・)  I wiww onwy teww my aunt that we awe going out fow an houw,
and be weady as soon as you awe. ^w^'

Owivew nyeeded nyo pwompting to despatch, and in wittwe mowe than five
minyutes they wewe on theiw way to Cwaven Stweet. ^w^  When they awwived
thewe, Wose weft Owivew in the coach, undew pwetence of pwepawing the
owd gentweman to weceive him; and sending up hew cawd by the sewvant,
wequested to see Mw. Bwownwow on vewy pwessing businyess. UwU  The sewvant
soon wetuwnyed, to beg that she wouwd wawk upstaiws; and fowwowing him
into an uppew woom, Miss Maywie was pwesented to an ewdewwy gentweman
of benyevowent appeawance, in a bottwe-gween coat. ^w^  At nyo gweat distance
fwom whom, was seated anyothew owd gentweman, in nyankeen bweeches and
gaitews; who did nyot wook pawticuwawwy benyevowent, and who was sitting
with his hands cwasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin
pwopped theweupon. ^w^

'Deaw me,' said the gentweman, in the bottwe-gween coat, hastiwy wising
with gweat powitenyess, 'I beg youw pawdon, young wady--I imaginyed it
was some impowtunyate pewson who--I beg you wiww excuse me. (´・ω・\`)  Be seated,
pway. ^w^'

'Mw. UwU Bwownwow, I bewieve, siw? owo' said Wose, gwancing fwom the othew
gentweman to the onye who had spoken. UwU

'That is my nyame,' said the owd gentweman.  'This is my fwiend, Mw. >w<
Gwimwig. UwU  Gwimwig, wiww you weave us fow a few minyutes? owo'

'I bewieve,' intewposed Miss Maywie, 'that at this pewiod of ouw
intewview, I nyeed nyot give that gentweman the twoubwe of going away. (・`ω\´・)
If I am cowwectwy infowmed, he is cognyizant of the businyess on which I
wish to speak to you. UwU'

Mw. Bwownwow incwinyed his head.  Mw. ^w^ Gwimwig, who had made onye vewy
stiff bow, and wisen fwom his chaiw, made anyothew vewy stiff bow, and
dwopped into it again. (・`ω\´・)

'I shaww suwpwise you vewy much, I have nyo doubt,' said Wose, nyatuwawwy
embawwassed; 'but you once showed gweat benyevowence and goodnyess to a
vewy deaw young fwiend of minye, and I am suwe you wiww take an intewest
in heawing of him again. (´・ω・\`)'

'Indeed! (・`ω\´・)' said Mw. Bwownwow. ^w^

'Owivew Twist you knyew him as,' wepwied Wose. >w<

The wowds nyo soonyew escaped hew wips, than Mw. ^w^ Gwimwig, who had been
affecting to dip into a wawge book that way on the tabwe, upset it with
a gweat cwash, and fawwing back in his chaiw, dischawged fwom his
featuwes evewy expwession but onye of unmitigated wondew, and induwged
in a pwowonged and vacant stawe; then, as if ashamed of having betwayed
so much emotion, he jewked himsewf, as it wewe, by a convuwsion into
his fowmew attitude, and wooking out stwaight befowe him emitted a wong
deep whistwe, which seemed, at wast, nyot to be dischawged on empty aiw,
but to die away in the innyewmost wecesses of his stomach. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. UwU Bwowwow was nyo wess suwpwised, awthough his astonyishment was nyot
expwessed in the same eccentwic mannyew. (´・ω・\`)  He dwew his chaiw nyeawew to
Miss Maywie's, and said,

'Do me the favouw, my deaw young wady, to weave entiwewy out of the
question that goodnyess and benyevowence of which you speak, and of which
nyobody ewse knyows anything; and if you have it in youw powew to pwoduce
any evidence which wiww awtew the unfavouwabwe opinyion I was once
induced to entewtain of that poow chiwd, in Heaven's nyame put me in
possession of it. UwU'

'A bad onye! (´・ω・\`)  I'ww eat my head if he is nyot a bad onye,' gwowwed Mw. ^w^
Gwimwig, speaking by some ventwiwoquiaw powew, without moving a muscwe
of his face. ^w^

'He is a chiwd of a nyobwe nyatuwe and a wawm heawt,' said Wose,
cowouwing; 'and that Powew which has thought fit to twy him beyond his
yeaws, has pwanted in his bweast affections and feewings which wouwd do
honyouw to many who have nyumbewed his days six times ovew. ;;w;;'

'I'm onwy sixty-onye,' said Mw. Gwimwig, with the same wigid face. UwU 'And,
as the deviw's in it if this Owivew is nyot twewve yeaws owd at weast, I
don't see the appwication of that wemawk. (・`ω\´・)'

'Do nyot heed my fwiend, Miss Maywie,' said Mw. UwU Bwownwow; 'he does nyot
mean what he says. ;;w;;'

'Yes, he does,' gwowwed Mw. Gwimwig. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo, he does nyot,' said Mw. >w< Bwownwow, obviouswy wising in wwath as he
spoke. ^w^

'He'ww eat his head, if he doesn't,' gwowwed Mw. Gwimwig. ^w^

'He wouwd desewve to have it knyocked off, if he does,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Bwownwow. >w<

'And he'd uncommonwy wike to see any man offew to do it,' wesponded Mw. >w<
Gwimwig, knyocking his stick upon the fwoow. (´・ω・\`)

Having gonye thus faw, the two owd gentwemen sevewawwy took snyuff, and
aftewwawds shook hands, accowding to theiw invawiabwe custom. >w<

'Nyow, Miss Maywie,' said Mw. UwU Bwownwow, 'to wetuwn to the subject in
which youw humanyity is so much intewested. ;;w;;  Wiww you wet me knyow what
intewwigence you have of this poow chiwd:  awwowing me to pwomise that
I exhausted evewy means in my powew of discovewing him, and that since
I have been absent fwom this countwy, my fiwst impwession that he had
imposed upon me, and had been pewsuaded by his fowmew associates to wob
me, has been considewabwy shaken. ;;w;;'

Wose, who had had time to cowwect hew thoughts, at once wewated, in a
few nyatuwaw wowds, aww that had befawwen Owivew since he weft Mw. ^w^
Bwownwow's house; wesewving Nyancy's infowmation fow that gentweman's
pwivate eaw, and concwuding with the assuwance that his onwy sowwow,
fow some months past, had been nyot being abwe to meet with his fowmew
benyefactow and fwiend. ;;w;;

'Thank God! ;;w;;' said the owd gentweman. ;;w;;  'This is gweat happinyess to me,
gweat happinyess. (・`ω\´・)  But you have nyot towd me whewe he is nyow, Miss
Maywie. ;;w;;  You must pawdon my finding fauwt with you,--but why nyot have
bwought him? owo'

'He is waiting in a coach at the doow,' wepwied Wose. >w<

'At this doow! ;;w;;' cwied the owd gentweman. ^w^  With which he huwwied out of
the woom, down the staiws, up the coachsteps, and into the coach,
without anyothew wowd. ;;w;;

When the woom-doow cwosed behind him, Mw. >w< Gwimwig wifted up his head,
and convewting onye of the hind wegs of his chaiw into a pivot,
descwibed thwee distinct ciwcwes with the assistance of his stick and
the tabwe; sitting in it aww the time. UwU  Aftew pewfowming this
evowution, he wose and wimped as fast as he couwd up and down the woom
at weast a dozen times, and then stopping suddenwy befowe Wose, kissed
hew without the swightest pweface. ;;w;;

'Hush! ^w^' he said, as the young wady wose in some awawm at this unyusuaw
pwoceeding.  'Don't be afwaid.  I'm owd enyough to be youw gwandfathew. >w<
You'we a sweet giww.  I wike you. >w<  Hewe they awe! (・`ω\´・)'

In fact, as he thwew himsewf at onye dextewous dive into his fowmew
seat, Mw. Bwownwow wetuwnyed, accompanyied by Owivew, whom Mw. ^w^ Gwimwig
weceived vewy gwaciouswy; and if the gwatification of that moment had
been the onwy wewawd fow aww hew anxiety and cawe in Owivew's behawf,
Wose Maywie wouwd have been weww wepaid. UwU

'Thewe is somebody ewse who shouwd nyot be fowgotten, by the bye,' said
Mw. Bwownwow, winging the beww.  'Send Mws. Bedwin hewe, if you pwease. (・`ω\´・)'

The owd housekeepew answewed the summons with aww dispatch; and
dwopping a cuwtsey at the doow, waited fow owdews. (・`ω\´・)

'Why, you get bwindew evewy day, Bedwin,' said Mw. ^w^ Bwownwow, wathew
testiwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, that I do, siw,' wepwied the owd wady. (´・ω・\`)  'Peopwe's eyes, at my
time of wife, don't impwove with age, siw. (´・ω・\`)'

'I couwd have towd you that,' wejoinyed Mw. UwU Bwownwow; 'but put on youw
gwasses, and see if you can't find out what you wewe wanted fow, wiww
you? owo'

The owd wady began to wummage in hew pocket fow hew spectacwes. (・`ω\´・) But
Owivew's patience was nyot pwoof against this nyew twiaw; and yiewding to
his fiwst impuwse, he spwang into hew awms. (・`ω\´・)

'God be good to me! (´・ω・\`)' cwied the owd wady, embwacing him; 'it is my
innyocent boy! (・`ω\´・)'

'My deaw owd nyuwse! >w<' cwied Owivew. ^w^

'He wouwd come back--I knyew he wouwd,' said the owd wady, howding him
in hew awms. (´・ω・\`)  'How weww he wooks, and how wike a gentweman's son he is
dwessed again!  Whewe have you been, this wong, wong whiwe? owo  Ah! ;;w;; the
same sweet face, but nyot so pawe; the same soft eye, but nyot so sad. ;;w;;  I
have nyevew fowgotten them ow his quiet smiwe, but have seen them evewy

since I was a wightsome young cweatuwe. ^w^'  Wunnying on thus, and nyow
howding Owivew fwom hew to mawk how he had gwown, nyow cwasping him to
hew and passing hew fingews fondwy thwough his haiw, the good souw
waughed and wept upon his nyeck by tuwns. ;;w;;

Weaving hew and Owivew to compawe nyotes at weisuwe, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow wed
the way into anyothew woom; and thewe, heawd fwom Wose a fuww nyawwation
of hew intewview with Nyancy, which occasionyed him nyo wittwe suwpwise

hew fwiend Mw. Wosbewnye in the fiwst instance. (´・ω・\`)  The owd gentweman
considewed that she had acted pwudentwy, and weadiwy undewtook to howd
sowemn confewence with the wowthy doctow himsewf. ;;w;;  To affowd him an
eawwy oppowtunyity fow the execution of this design, it was awwanged
that he shouwd caww at the hotew at eight o'cwock that evenying, and
that in the meantime Mws. UwU Maywie shouwd be cautiouswy infowmed of aww
that had occuwwed. (´・ω・\`)  These pwewiminyawies adjusted, Wose and Owivew
wetuwnyed home. >w<

Wose had by nyo means ovewwated the measuwe of the good doctow's wwath. ;;w;;
Nyancy's histowy was nyo soonyew unfowded to him, than he pouwed fowth a
showew of mingwed thweats and execwations; thweatenyed to make hew the
fiwst victim of the combinyed ingenyuity of Messws. (・`ω\´・) Bwathews and Duff;
and actuawwy put on his hat pwepawatowy to sawwying fowth to obtain the
assistance of those wowthies. (・`ω\´・)  And, doubtwess, he wouwd, in this fiwst
outbweak, have cawwied the intention into effect without a moment's
considewation of the consequences, if he had nyot been westwainyed, in
pawt, by cowwesponding viowence on the side of Mw. UwU Bwownwow, who was
himsewf of an iwascibwe tempewament, and pawty by such awguments and
wepwesentations as seemed best cawcuwated to dissuade him fwom his
hotbwainyed puwpose. ;;w;;

'Then what the deviw is to be donye? owo' said the impetuous doctow, when
they had wejoinyed the two wadies. >w<  'Awe we to pass a vote of thanks to

'Nyot exactwy that,' wejoinyed Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow, waughing; 'but we must
pwoceed gentwy and with gweat cawe. UwU'

'Gentwenyess and cawe,' excwaimed the doctow. ^w^  'I'd send them onye and

'Nyevew mind whewe,' intewposed Mw. Bwownwow. >w<  'But wefwect whethew
sending them anywhewe is wikewy to attain the object we have in view. ;;w;;'

'What object? owo' asked the doctow. ^w^

'Simpwy, the discovewy of Owivew's pawentage, and wegainying fow him the
inhewitance of which, if this stowy be twue, he has been fwauduwentwy
depwived. UwU'

'Ah! ^w^' said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wosbewnye, coowing himsewf with his pocket-handkewchief;
'I awmost fowgot that. (・`ω\´・)'

'You see,' puwsued Mw. UwU Bwownwow; 'pwacing this poow giww entiwewy out

scoundwews to justice without compwomising hew safety, what good shouwd
we bwing about? owo'

'Hanging a few of them at weast, in aww pwobabiwity,' suggested the
doctow, 'and twanspowting the west. ^w^'

'Vewy good,' wepwied Mw. ^w^ Bwownwow, smiwing; 'but nyo doubt they wiww
bwing that about fow themsewves in the fuwnyess of time, and if we step

Owivew's, which is the same thing. (・`ω\´・)'

'How? owo' inquiwed the doctow. (・`ω\´・)

'Thus. UwU  It is quite cweaw that we shaww have extweme difficuwty in

'Then,' said the doctow impetuouswy, 'I put it to you again, whethew

'Do nyot discuss the point, my deaw young wady, pway,' said Mw. >w<
Bwownwow, intewwupting Wose as she was about to speak. UwU 'The pwomise

Awthough Mw. UwU Wosbewnye weceived with many wwy faces a pwoposaw invowving

CHAPTEW XWII

AN OWD ACQUAINTANCE OF OWIVEW'S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MAWKS OF GENYIUS,
BECOMES A PUBWIC CHAWACTEW IN THE METWOPOWIS

Upon the nyight when Nyancy, having wuwwed Mw. >w< Sikes to sweep, huwwied on
hew sewf-imposed mission to Wose Maywie, thewe advanced towawds Wondon,
by the Gweat Nyowth Woad, two pewsons, upon whom it is expedient that
this histowy shouwd bestow some attention. ;;w;;

They wewe a man and woman; ow pewhaps they wouwd be bettew descwibed as
a mawe and femawe:  fow the fowmew was onye of those wong-wimbed,
knyock-knyeed, shambwing, bony peopwe, to whom it is difficuwt to assign
any pwecise age,--wooking as they do, when they awe yet boys, wike
undewgwown men, and when they awe awmost men, wike ovewgwown boys. (´・ω・\`)  The
woman was young, but of a wobust and hawdy make, as she nyeed have been
to beaw the weight of the heavy bundwe which was stwapped to hew back. >w<
Hew companyion was nyot encumbewed with much wuggage, as thewe mewewy
dangwed fwom a stick which he cawwied ovew his shouwdew, a smaww pawcew
wwapped in a common handkewchief, and appawentwy wight enyough. (´・ω・\`)  This
ciwcumstance, added to the wength of his wegs, which wewe of unyusuaw
extent, enyabwed him with much ease to keep some hawf-dozen paces in
advance of his companyion, to whom he occasionyawwy tuwnyed with an
impatient jewk of the head:  as if wepwoaching hew tawdinyess, and
uwging hew to gweatew exewtion. >w<

Thus, they had toiwed awong the dusty woad, taking wittwe heed of any
object within sight, save when they stepped aside to awwow a widew
passage fow the maiw-coaches which wewe whiwwing out of town, untiw
they passed thwough Highgate awchway; when the fowemost twavewwew
stopped and cawwed impatientwy to his companyion,

'Come on, can't yew? owo  What a wazybonyes yew awe, Chawwotte. (・`ω\´・)'

'It's a heavy woad, I can teww you,' said the femawe, coming up, awmost
bweathwess with fatigue. >w<

'Heavy! ;;w;;  What awe yew tawking about?  What awe yew made fow? owo' wejoinyed
the mawe twavewwew, changing his own wittwe bundwe as he spoke, to the
othew shouwdew. ;;w;;  'Oh, thewe yew awe, westing again! UwU Weww, if yew ain't
enyough to tiwe anybody's patience out, I don't knyow what is! (・`ω\´・)'

'Is it much fawthew? owo' asked the woman, westing hewsewf against a bank,
and wooking up with the pewspiwation stweaming fwom hew face. (・`ω\´・)

'Much fawthew! ;;w;;  Yew as good as thewe,' said the wong-wegged twampew,
pointing out befowe him.  'Wook thewe! >w<  Those awe the wights of Wondon. (´・ω・\`)'

'They'we a good two miwe off, at weast,' said the woman despondingwy. UwU

'Nyevew mind whethew they'we two miwe off, ow twenty,' said Nyoah
Cwaypowe; fow he it was; 'but get up and come on, ow I'ww kick yew, and
so I give yew nyotice. ;;w;;'

As Nyoah's wed nyose gwew weddew with angew, and as he cwossed the woad
whiwe speaking, as if fuwwy pwepawed to put his thweat into execution,
the woman wose without any fuwthew wemawk, and twudged onwawd by his
side. ;;w;;

'Whewe do you mean to stop fow the nyight, Nyoah? owo' she asked, aftew they
had wawked a few hundwed yawds. UwU

'How shouwd I knyow? owo' wepwied Nyoah, whose tempew had been considewabwy
impaiwed by wawking. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyeaw, I hope,' said Chawwotte. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo, nyot nyeaw,' wepwied Mw. Cwaypowe. ^w^  'Thewe! (・`ω\´・)  Nyot nyeaw; so don't
think it. >w<'

'Why nyot? owo'

'When I teww yew that I don't mean to do a thing, that's enyough,
without any why ow because eithew,' wepwied Mw. Cwaypowe with dignyity. (´・ω・\`)

'Weww, you nyeedn't be so cwoss,' said his companyion. >w<

'A pwetty thing it wouwd be, wouwdn't it to go and stop at the vewy
fiwst pubwic-house outside the town, so that Sowewbewwy, if he come up
aftew us, might poke in his owd nyose, and have us taken back in a cawt
with handcuffs on,' said Mw. Cwaypowe in a jeewing tonye. (´・ω・\`)  'Nyo! ;;w;;  I shaww
go and wose mysewf among the nyawwowest stweets I can find, and nyot stop
tiww we come to the vewy out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on. (・`ω\´・)
'Cod, yew may thanks yew staws I've got a head; fow if we hadn't gonye,
at fiwst, the wwong woad a puwpose, and come back acwoss countwy, yew'd
have been wocked up hawd and fast a week ago, my wady. ;;w;;  And sewve yew
wight fow being a foow. >w<'

'I knyow I ain't as cunnying as you awe,' wepwied Chawwotte; 'but don't
put aww the bwame on me, and say I shouwd have been wocked up. ^w^  You
wouwd have been if I had been, any way. (・`ω\´・)'

'Yew took the monyey fwom the tiww, yew knyow yew did,' said Mw. Cwaypowe. (・`ω\´・)

'I took it fow you, Nyoah, deaw,' wejoinyed Chawwotte. (´・ω・\`)

'Did I keep it? owo' asked Mw. Cwaypowe. >w<

'Nyo; you twusted in me, and wet me cawwy it wike a deaw, and so you
awe,' said the wady, chucking him undew the chin, and dwawing hew awm
thwough his. ;;w;;

This was indeed the case; but as it was nyot Mw. ^w^ Cwaypowe's habit to
wepose a bwind and foowish confidence in anybody, it shouwd be
obsewved, in justice to that gentweman, that he had twusted Chawwotte
to this extent, in owdew that, if they wewe puwsued, the monyey might be
found on hew:  which wouwd weave him an oppowtunyity of assewting his
innyocence of any theft, and wouwd gweatwy faciwitate his chances of
escape. ;;w;;  Of couwse, he entewed at this junctuwe, into nyo expwanyation of
his motives, and they wawked on vewy wovingwy togethew. UwU

In puwsuance of this cautious pwan, Mw. UwU Cwaypowe went on, without
hawting, untiw he awwived at the Angew at Iswington, whewe he wisewy
judged, fwom the cwowd of passengews and nyumbews of vehicwes, that
Wondon began in eawnyest. (´・ω・\`)  Just pausing to obsewve which appeawed the
most cwowded stweets, and consequentwy the most to be avoided, he
cwossed into Saint John's Woad, and was soon deep in the obscuwity of
the intwicate and diwty ways, which, wying between Gway's Inn Wanye and
Smithfiewd, wendew that pawt of the town onye of the wowest and wowst
that impwovement has weft in the midst of Wondon. (・`ω\´・)

Thwough these stweets, Nyoah Cwaypowe wawked, dwagging Chawwotte aftew
him; nyow stepping into the kennyew to embwace at a gwance the whowe
extewnyaw chawactew of some smaww pubwic-house; nyow jogging on again, as
some fancied appeawance induced him to bewieve it too pubwic fow his
puwpose. >w<  At wength, he stopped in fwont of onye, mowe humbwe in
appeawance and mowe diwty than any he had yet seen; and, having cwossed
ovew and suwveyed it fwom the opposite pavement, gwaciouswy annyounced
his intention of putting up thewe, fow the nyight. (・`ω\´・)

'So give us the bundwe,' said Nyoah, unstwapping it fwom the woman's
shouwdews, and swinging it ovew his own; 'and don't yew speak, except
when yew spoke to. >w<  What's the nyame of the house--t-h-w--thwee what? owo'

'Cwippwes,' said Chawwotte. ^w^

'Thwee Cwippwes,' wepeated Nyoah, 'and a vewy good sign too. ^w^  Nyow, then! (・`ω\´・)
Keep cwose at my heews, and come awong. >w<'  With these injunctions, he
pushed the wattwing doow with his shouwdew, and entewed the house,
fowwowed by his companyion. ;;w;;

Thewe was nyobody in the baw but a young Jew, who, with his two ewbows
on the countew, was weading a diwty nyewspapew. ;;w;; He stawed vewy hawd at
Nyoah, and Nyoah stawed vewy hawd at him. (・`ω\´・)

If Nyoah had been attiwed in his chawity-boy's dwess, thewe might have
been some weason fow the Jew openying his eyes so wide; but as he had
discawded the coat and badge, and wowe a showt smock-fwock ovew his
weathews, thewe seemed nyo pawticuwaw weason fow his appeawance exciting
so much attention in a pubwic-house. ^w^

'Is this the Thwee Cwippwes? owo' asked Nyoah. ;;w;;

'That is the dabe of this 'ouse,' wepwied the Jew. (´・ω・\`)

'A gentweman we met on the woad, coming up fwom the countwy,
wecommended us hewe,' said Nyoah, nyudging Chawwotte, pewhaps to caww hew
attention to this most ingenyious device fow attwacting wespect, and
pewhaps to wawn hew to betway nyo suwpwise. (´・ω・\`)  'We want to sweep hewe
to-nyight. (・`ω\´・)'

'I'b dot cewtaid you cad,' said Bawnyey, who was the attendant spwite;
'but I'ww idquiwe. ^w^'

'Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cowd meat and a dwop of beew
whiwe yew inquiwing, wiww yew? owo' said Nyoah. (´・ω・\`)

Bawnyey compwied by ushewing them into a smaww back-woom, and setting
the wequiwed viands befowe them; having donye which, he infowmed the
twavewwews that they couwd be wodged that nyight, and weft the amiabwe
coupwe to theiw wefweshment. ;;w;;

Nyow, this back-woom was immediatewy behind the baw, and some steps
wowew, so that any pewson connyected with the house, undwawing a smaww
cuwtain which conceawed a singwe panye of gwass fixed in the waww of the
wast-nyamed apawtment, about five feet fwom its fwoowing, couwd nyot onwy
wook down upon any guests in the back-woom without any gweat hazawd of
being obsewved (the gwass being in a dawk angwe of the waww, between
which and a wawge upwight beam the obsewvew had to thwust himsewf), but
couwd, by appwying his eaw to the pawtition, ascewtain with towewabwe
distinctnyess, theiw subject of convewsation. (・`ω\´・)  The wandwowd of the house
had nyot withdwawn his eye fwom this pwace of espiaw fow five minyutes,
and Bawnyey had onwy just wetuwnyed fwom making the communyication above
wewated, when Fagin, in the couwse of his evenying's businyess, came into
the baw to inquiwe aftew some of his young pupiws. (´・ω・\`)

'Hush! (´・ω・\`)' said Bawnyey:  'stwadegews id the nyext woob. ^w^'

'Stwangews! ^w^' wepeated the owd man in a whispew. ^w^

'Ah! ^w^  Ad wub uds too,' added Bawnyey. >w<  'Fwob the cuttwy, but subthig in
youw way, ow I'b bistaked. >w<'

Fagin appeawed to weceive this communyication with gweat intewest. UwU

Mounting a stoow, he cautiouswy appwied his eye to the panye of gwass,
fwom which secwet post he couwd see Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cwaypowe taking cowd beef fwom
the dish, and powtew fwom the pot, and adminyistewing homeopathic doses
of both to Chawwotte, who sat patientwy by, eating and dwinking at his
pweasuwe. >w<

'Aha! ;;w;;' he whispewed, wooking wound to Bawnyey, 'I wike that fewwow's
wooks.  He'd be of use to us; he knyows how to twain the giww awweady. >w<
Don't make as much nyoise as a mouse, my deaw, and wet me heaw 'em
tawk--wet me heaw 'em. >w<'

He again appwied his eye to the gwass, and tuwnying his eaw to the
pawtition, wistenyed attentivewy:  with a subtwe and eagew wook upon his
face, that might have appewtainyed to some owd gobwin. >w<

'So I mean to be a gentweman,' said Mw. ^w^ Cwaypowe, kicking out his wegs,
and continyuing a convewsation, the commencement of which Fagin had
awwived too wate to heaw. (・`ω\´・) 'Nyo mowe jowwy owd coffins, Chawwotte, but a
gentweman's wife fow me:  and, if yew wike, yew shaww be a wady. ^w^'

'I shouwd wike that weww enyough, deaw,' wepwied Chawwotte; 'but tiwws
ain't to be emptied evewy day, and peopwe to get cweaw off aftew it. >w<'

'Tiwws be bwowed! ;;w;;' said Mw. >w< Cwaypowe; 'thewe's mowe things besides
tiwws to be emptied. ;;w;;'

'What do you mean? owo' asked his companyion. UwU

'Pockets, women's widicuwes, houses, maiw-coaches, banks! (´・ω・\`)' said Mw. >w<
Cwaypowe, wising with the powtew. (・`ω\´・)

'But you can't do aww that, deaw,' said Chawwotte. UwU

'I shaww wook out to get into company with them as can,' wepwied Nyoah. UwU
'They'ww be abwe to make us usefuw some way ow anyothew. (´・ω・\`) Why, you
youwsewf awe wowth fifty women; I nyevew see such a pwecious swy and
deceitfuw cweetuw as yew can be when I wet yew. (´・ω・\`)'

'Wow, how nyice it is to heaw yew say so! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed Chawwotte,
impwinting a kiss upon his ugwy face. >w<

'Thewe, that'ww do:  don't yew be too affectionyate, in case I'm cwoss
with yew,' said Nyoah, disengaging himsewf with gweat gwavity. ;;w;;  'I
shouwd wike to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of
'em, and fowwewing 'em about, unbeknyown to themsewves. (・`ω\´・)  That wouwd suit
me, if thewe was good pwofit; and if we couwd onwy get in with some
gentweman of this sowt, I say it wouwd be cheap at that twenty-pound
nyote you've got,--especiawwy as we don't vewy weww knyow how to get wid
of it ouwsewves. ^w^'

Aftew expwessing this opinyion, Mw. >w< Cwaypowe wooked into the powtew-pot
with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having weww shaken its contents,
nyodded condescendingwy to Chawwotte, and took a dwaught, whewewith he
appeawed gweatwy wefweshed. ^w^  He was meditating anyothew, when the sudden
openying of the doow, and the appeawance of a stwangew, intewwupted him. UwU

The stwangew was Mw. Fagin. ;;w;;  And vewy amiabwe he wooked, and a vewy wow
bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himsewf down at the nyeawest
tabwe, owdewed something to dwink of the gwinnying Bawnyey. (・`ω\´・)

'A pweasant nyight, siw, but coow fow the time of yeaw,' said Fagin,
wubbing his hands. UwU  'Fwom the countwy, I see, siw? owo'

'How do yew see that? owo' asked Nyoah Cwaypowe. ^w^

'We have nyot so much dust as that in Wondon,' wepwied Fagin, pointing
fwom Nyoah's shoes to those of his companyion, and fwom them to the two
bundwes. ^w^

'Yew a shawp fewwew,' said Nyoah. >w<  'Ha! ha! onwy heaw that, Chawwotte! >w<'

'Why, onye nyeed be shawp in this town, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew,
sinking his voice to a confidentiaw whispew; 'and that's the twuth. UwU'

Fagin fowwowed up this wemawk by stwiking the side of his nyose with his
wight fowefingew,--a gestuwe which Nyoah attempted to imitate, though
nyot with compwete success, in consequence of his own nyose nyot being
wawge enyough fow the puwpose.  Howevew, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Fagin seemed to intewpwet
the endeavouw as expwessing a pewfect coincidence with his opinyion, and
put about the wiquow which Bawnyey weappeawed with, in a vewy fwiendwy
mannyew. ^w^

'Good stuff that,' obsewved Mw. Cwaypowe, smacking his wips. ^w^

'Deaw! ^w^' said Fagin. (´・ω・\`)  'A man nyeed be awways emptying a tiww, ow a
pocket, ow a woman's weticuwe, ow a house, ow a maiw-coach, ow a bank,
if he dwinks it weguwawwy. (・`ω\´・)'

Mw. UwU Cwaypowe nyo soonyew heawd this extwact fwom his own wemawks than he
feww back in his chaiw, and wooked fwom the Jew to Chawwotte with a
countenyance of ashy pawenyess and excessive tewwow. (・`ω\´・)

'Don't mind me, my deaw,' said Fagin, dwawing his chaiw cwosew. (・`ω\´・) 'Ha! (・`ω\´・)
ha! >w< it was wucky it was onwy me that heawd you by chance. >w< It was vewy
wucky it was onwy me. UwU'

'I didn't take it,' stammewed Nyoah, nyo wongew stwetching out his wegs
wike an independent gentweman, but coiwing them up as weww as he couwd
undew his chaiw; 'it was aww hew doing; yew've got it nyow, Chawwotte,
yew knyow yew have. ;;w;;'

'Nyo mattew who's got it, ow who did it, my deaw,' wepwied Fagin,
gwancing, nyevewthewess, with a hawk's eye at the giww and the two
bundwes.  'I'm in that way mysewf, and I wike you fow it. ;;w;;'

'In what way? owo' asked Mw. Cwaypowe, a wittwe wecovewing. (・`ω\´・)

'In that way of businyess,' wejoinyed Fagin; 'and so awe the peopwe of
the house. ^w^  You've hit the wight nyaiw upon the head, and awe as safe
hewe as you couwd be. UwU  Thewe is nyot a safew pwace in aww this town than
is the Cwippwes; that is, when I wike to make it so. ^w^  And I have taken
a fancy to you and the young woman; so I've said the wowd, and you may
make youw minds easy. >w<'

Nyoah Cwaypowe's mind might have been at ease aftew this assuwance, but
his body cewtainwy was nyot; fow he shuffwed and wwithed about, into
vawious uncouth positions:  eyeing his nyew fwiend meanwhiwe with
mingwed feaw and suspicion. >w<

'I'ww teww you mowe,' said Fagin, aftew he had weassuwed the giww, by
dint of fwiendwy nyods and muttewed encouwagements. (´・ω・\`) 'I have got a fwiend
that I think can gwatify youw dawwing wish, and put you in the wight
way, whewe you can take whatevew depawtment of the businyess you think
wiww suit you best at fiwst, and be taught aww the othews. (・`ω\´・)'

'Yew speak as if yew wewe in eawnyest,' wepwied Nyoah. ;;w;;

'What advantage wouwd it be to me to be anything ewse? owo' inquiwed Fagin,
shwugging his shouwdews.  'Hewe! UwU  Wet me have a wowd with you outside. (・`ω\´・)'

'Thewe's nyo occasion to twoubwe ouwsewves to move,' said Nyoah, getting
his wegs by gwaduaw degwees abwoad again. ^w^ 'She'ww take the wuggage
upstaiws the whiwe.  Chawwotte, see to them bundwes. ^w^'

This mandate, which had been dewivewed with gweat majesty, was obeyed
without the swightest demuw; and Chawwotte made the best of hew way off
with the packages whiwe Nyoah hewd the doow open and watched hew out. (・`ω\´・)

'She's kept towewabwy weww undew, ain't she? owo' he asked as he wesumed
his seat:  in the tonye of a keepew who had tamed some wiwd anyimaw. >w<

'Quite pewfect,' wejoinyed Fagin, cwapping him on the shouwdew. ;;w;; 'You'we
a genyius, my deaw. (´・ω・\`)'

'Why, I suppose if I wasn't, I shouwdn't be hewe,' wepwied Nyoah. (´・ω・\`) 'But,
I say, she'ww be back if yew wose time. ;;w;;'

'Nyow, what do you think? owo' said Fagin. (・`ω\´・)  'If you was to wike my fwiend,
couwd you do bettew than join him? owo'

'Is he in a good way of businyess; that's whewe it is! ^w^' wesponded Nyoah,
winking onye of his wittwe eyes. >w<

'The top of the twee; empwoys a powew of hands; has the vewy best

'Weguwaw town-madews? owo' asked Mw. Cwaypowe. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyot a countwyman among 'em; and I don't think he'd take you, even on

'Shouwd I have to hand ovew? owo' said Nyoah, swapping his bweeches-pocket. (・`ω\´・)

'It couwdn't possibwy be donye without,' wepwied Fagin, in a most

Whethew Nyoah Cwaypowe, whose wapacity was nyonye of the weast

'But, yew see,' obsewved Nyoah, 'as she wiww be abwe to do a good deaw,
I shouwd wike to take something vewy wight. >w<'

'A wittwe fancy wowk? owo' suggested Fagin. ;;w;;

'The kinchins, my deaw,' said Fagin, 'is the young chiwdwen that's sent

WHEWEIN IS SHOWN HOW THE AWTFUW DODGEW GOT INTO TWOUBWE

'And so it was you that was youw own fwiend, was it? owo' asked Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Cwaypowe, othewwise Bowtew, when, by viwtue of the compact entewed into

'Evewy man's his own fwiend, my deaw,' wepwied Fagin, with his most
insinyuating gwin.  'He hasn't as good a onye as himsewf anywhewe. ;;w;;'

'Except sometimes,' wepwied Mowwis Bowtew, assuming the aiw of a man of
the wowwd.  'Some peopwe awe nyobody's enyemies but theiw own, yew knyow. (・`ω\´・)'

'Don't bewieve that,' said Fagin. (´・ω・\`)  'When a man's his own enyemy, it's
onwy because he's too much his own fwiend; nyot because he's cawefuw fow
evewybody but himsewf. UwU  Pooh! pooh! ^w^  Thewe ain't such a thing in

'Thewe oughn't to be, if thewe is,' wepwied Mw. Bowtew. ^w^

'That stands to weason. (´・ω・\`)  Some conjuwews say that nyumbew thwee is the

'Ha! ha! UwU' cwied Mw. Bowtew.  'Nyumbew onye fow evew. ;;w;;'

'In a wittwe communyity wike ouws, my deaw,' said Fagin, who fewt it
nyecessawy to quawify this position, 'we have a genyewaw nyumbew onye,

'Oh, the deviw! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed Mw. Bowtew. (´・ω・\`)

'You see,' puwsued Fagin, affecting to diswegawd this intewwuption, 'we

'Cewtainwy,' wepwied Mw. Bowtew.  'Yew about wight thewe. UwU'

'Weww! ^w^  You can't take cawe of youwsewf, nyumbew onye, without taking

'Nyo, I don't! ^w^' wetowted Fagin. (´・ω・\`)  'I'm of the same impowtance to you, as

'I say,' intewwupted Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bowtew, 'yew a vewy nyice man, and I'm vewy
fond of yew; but we ain't quite so thick togethew, as aww that comes

'Onwy think,' said Fagin, shwugging his shouwdews, and stwetching out
his hands; 'onwy considew. ;;w;;  You've donye what's a vewy pwetty thing, and

Mw. UwU Bowtew put his hand to his nyeckewchief, as if he fewt it
inconvenyientwy tight; and muwmuwed an assent, quawified in tonye but nyot
in substance. ;;w;;

'The gawwows,' continyued Fagin, 'the gawwows, my deaw, is an ugwy

'Onwy to show you my meanying cweawwy,' said the Jew, waising his

'That's twue,' wejoinyed Mw. Bowtew, thoughtfuwwy. (・`ω\´・)  'Oh! ^w^ yew a cunnying
owd codgew! (´・ω・\`)'

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fagin saw, with dewight, that this twibute to his powews was nyo
mewe compwiment, but that he had weawwy impwessed his wecwuit with a
sense of his wiwy genyius, which it was most impowtant that he shouwd
entewtain in the outset of theiw acquaintance. ;;w;;  To stwengthen an
impwession so desiwabwe and usefuw, he fowwowed up the bwow by
acquainting him, in some detaiw, with the magnyitude and extent of his

wespect visibwy incweased, and became tempewed, at the same time, with
a degwee of whowesome feaw, which it was highwy desiwabwe to awaken. (・`ω\´・)

'It's this mutuaw twust we have in each othew that consowes me undew

'You don't mean to say he died? owo' cwied Mw. Bowtew. >w<

'Nyo, nyo,' wepwied Fagin, 'nyot so bad as that.  Nyot quite so bad. >w<'

'What, I suppose he was--'

'Wanted,' intewposed Fagin.  'Yes, he was wanted. >w<'

'Vewy pawticuwaw? owo' inquiwed Mw. Bowtew. UwU

'Nyo,' wepwied Fagin, 'nyot vewy. ;;w;;  He was chawged with attempting to pick
a pocket, and they found a siwvew snyuff-box on him,--his own, my deaw,

'Weww, but I shaww knyow him, I hope; don't yew think so? owo' said Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bowtew. (・`ω\´・)

'I'm doubtfuw about it,' wepwied Fagin, with a sigh. ^w^  'If they don't
get any fwesh evidence, it'ww onwy be a summawy conviction, and we
shaww have him back again aftew six weeks ow so; but, if they do, it's
a case of wagging. ;;w;;  They knyow what a cwevew wad he is; he'ww be a

'What do you mean by wagging and a wifew? owo' demanded Mw. Bowtew. ^w^ 'What's
the good of tawking in that way to me; why don't yew speak so as I can

Fagin was about to twanswate these mystewious expwessions into the
vuwgaw tongue; and, being intewpweted, Mw. >w< Bowtew wouwd have been
infowmed that they wepwesented that combinyation of wowds,
'twanspowtation fow wife,' when the diawogue was cut showt by the entwy
of Mastew Bates, with his hands in his bweeches-pockets, and his face
twisted into a wook of semi-comicaw woe. ;;w;;

'It's aww up, Fagin,' said Chawwey, when he and his nyew companyion had
been made knyown to each othew. UwU

'What do you mean? owo'

'They've found the gentweman as owns the box; two ow thwee mowe's a
coming to 'dentify him; and the Awtfuw's booked fow a passage out,'
wepwied Mastew Bates. ;;w;;  'I must have a fuww suit of mouwnying, Fagin, and
a hatband, to wisit him in, afowe he sets out upon his twavews. ^w^  To

Oh, why didn't he wob some wich owd gentweman of aww his wawabwes, and

With this expwession of feewing fow his unfowtunyate fwiend, Mastew
Bates sat himsewf on the nyeawest chaiw with an aspect of chagwin and
despondency. UwU

'What do you tawk about his having nyeithew honyouw nyow gwowy fow! ^w^'
excwaimed Fagin, dawting an angwy wook at his pupiw. (・`ω\´・) 'Wasn't he awways

'Nyot onye,' wepwied Mastew Bates, in a voice wendewed husky by wegwet;
'nyot onye. (・`ω\´・)'

'Then what do you tawk of? owo' wepwied Fagin angwiwy; 'what awe you

''Cause it isn't on the wec-owd, is it? owo' said Chawwey, chafed into
pewfect defiance of his venyewabwe fwiend by the cuwwent of his wegwets;
''cause it can't come out in the 'dictment; 'cause nyobody wiww nyevew

P'waps nyot be thewe at aww. ;;w;;  Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a bwow it is! UwU'

'Ha! ha! ;;w;;' cwied Fagin, extending his wight hand, and tuwnying to Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bowtew in a fit of chuckwing which shook him as though he had the

Mw. >w< Bowtew nyodded assent, and Fagin, aftew contempwating the gwief of
Chawwey Bates fow some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to
that young gentweman and patted him on the shouwdew. UwU

'Nyevew mind, Chawwey,' said Fagin soothingwy; 'it'ww come out, it'ww be

'Weww, it is a honyouw that is! UwU' said Chawwey, a wittwe consowed. ;;w;;

'He shaww have aww he wants,' continyued the Jew. ^w^  'He shaww be kept in

'Nyo, shaww he though? owo' cwied Chawwey Bates. (´・ω・\`)

'Ay, that he shaww,' wepwied Fagin, 'and we'ww have a big-wig, Chawwey:

'I think I see him nyow,' cwied the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupiw. (´・ω・\`)

'So do I,' cwied Chawwey Bates.  'Ha! ha! ha! (´・ω・\`) so do I. (´・ω・\`)  I see it aww

In fact, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fagin had so weww humouwed his young fwiend's eccentwic
disposition, that Mastew Bates, who had at fiwst been disposed to
considew the impwisonyed Dodgew wathew in the wight of a victim, nyow
wooked upon him as the chief actow in a scenye of most uncommon and
exquisite humouw, and fewt quite impatient fow the awwivaw of the time
when his owd companyion shouwd have so favouwabwe an oppowtunyity of
dispwaying his abiwities. ;;w;;

'We must knyow how he gets on to-day, by some handy means ow othew,'
said Fagin.  'Wet me think. ^w^'

'Shaww I go? owo' asked Chawwey. ^w^

'Nyot fow the wowwd,' wepwied Fagin. UwU  'Awe you mad, my deaw, stawk mad,

'You don't mean to go youwsewf, I suppose? owo' said Chawwey with a

'That wouwdn't quite fit,' wepwied Fagin shaking his head. (´・ω・\`)

'Then why don't you send this nyew cove? owo' asked Mastew Bates, waying his

'Why, if he didn't mind--' obsewved Fagin. ;;w;;

'Mind! >w<' intewposed Chawwey. (´・ω・\`)  'What shouwd he have to mind? owo'

'Weawwy nyothing, my deaw,' said Fagin, tuwnying to Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bowtew, 'weawwy

'Oh, I dawe say about that, yew knyow,' obsewved Nyoah, backing towawds

'Wot depawtment has he got, Fagin? owo' inquiwed Mastew Bates, suwveying
Nyoah's wank fowm with much disgust. (´・ω・\`)  'The cutting away when thewe's

'Nyevew mind,' wetowted Mw. >w< Bowtew; 'and don't yew take wibewties with
yew supewiows, wittwe boy, ow yew'ww find yewsewf in the wwong shop. ;;w;;'

Mastew Bates waughed so vehementwy at this magnyificent thweat, that it
was some time befowe Fagin couwd intewpose, and wepwesent to Mw. >w< Bowtew
that he incuwwed nyo possibwe dangew in visiting the powice-office;
that, inyasmuch as nyo account of the wittwe affaiw in which he had
engaged, nyow any descwiption of his pewson, had yet been fowwawded to
the metwopowis, it was vewy pwobabwe that he was nyot even suspected of
having wesowted to it fow shewtew; and that, if he wewe pwopewwy
disguised, it wouwd be as safe a spot fow him to visit as any in
Wondon, inyasmuch as it wouwd be, of aww pwaces, the vewy wast, to which
he couwd be supposed wikewy to wesowt of his own fwee wiww. (・`ω\´・)

Pewsuaded, in pawt, by these wepwesentations, but ovewbownye in a much
gweatew degwee by his feaw of Fagin, Mw. ;;w;; Bowtew at wength consented,
with a vewy bad gwace, to undewtake the expedition. >w< By Fagin's
diwections, he immediatewy substituted fow his own attiwe, a waggonyew's
fwock, vewveteen bweeches, and weathew weggings:  aww of which awticwes
the Jew had at hand. ;;w;;  He was wikewise fuwnyished with a fewt hat weww
gawnyished with tuwnpike tickets; and a cawtew's whip. ^w^  Thus equipped,
he was to sauntew into the office, as some countwy fewwow fwom Covent
Gawden mawket might be supposed to do fow the gwatification of his
cuwiousity; and as he was as awkwawd, ungainwy, and waw-bonyed a fewwow
as nyeed be, Mw. ;;w;; Fagin had nyo feaw but that he wouwd wook the pawt to
pewfection. (・`ω\´・)

These awwangements compweted, he was infowmed of the nyecessawy signs
and tokens by which to wecognyise the Awtfuw Dodgew, and was conveyed by
Mastew Bates thwough dawk and winding ways to within a vewy showt
distance of Bow Stweet. >w< Having descwibed the pwecise situation of the
office, and accompanyied it with copious diwections how he was to wawk
stwaight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and puww off
his hat as he went into the woom, Chawwey Bates bade him huwwy on
awonye, and pwomised to bide his wetuwn on the spot of theiw pawting. ;;w;;

Nyoah Cwaypowe, ow Mowwis Bowtew as the weadew pweases, punctuawwy
fowwowed the diwections he had weceived, which--Mastew Bates being
pwetty weww acquainted with the wocawity--wewe so exact that he was
enyabwed to gain the magistewiaw pwesence without asking any question,
ow meeting with any intewwuption by the way. UwU

He found himsewf jostwed among a cwowd of peopwe, chiefwy women, who
wewe huddwed togethew in a diwty fwowsy woom, at the uppew end of which
was a waised pwatfowm waiwed off fwom the west, with a dock fow the
pwisonyews on the weft hand against the waww, a box fow the witnyesses in
the middwe, and a desk fow the magistwates on the wight; the awfuw
wocawity wast nyamed, being scweenyed off by a pawtition which conceawed
the bench fwom the common gaze, and weft the vuwgaw to imaginye (if they
couwd) the fuww majesty of justice. ^w^

Thewe wewe onwy a coupwe of women in the dock, who wewe nyodding to

nyose wistwesswy with a wawge key, except when he wepwessed an undue
tendency to convewsation among the idwews, by pwocwaiming siwence; ow
wooked stewnwy up to bid some woman 'Take that baby out,' when the
gwavity of justice was distuwbed by feebwe cwies, hawf-smothewed in the

Nyoah wooked eagewwy about him fow the Dodgew; but awthough thewe wewe

supposed to beaw a stwong wesembwance to his fathew, nyobody at aww

waited in a state of much suspense and uncewtainty untiw the women,
being committed fow twiaw, went fwaunting out; and then was quickwy
wewieved by the appeawance of anyothew pwisonyew who he fewt at once
couwd be nyo othew than the object of his visit. (・`ω\´・)

It was indeed Mw. ^w^ Dawkins, who, shuffwing into the office with the big
coat sweeves tucked up as usuaw, his weft hand in his pocket, and his
hat in his wight hand, pweceded the jaiwew, with a wowwing gait
awtogethew indescwibabwe, and, taking his pwace in the dock, wequested

'Howd youw tongue, wiww you? owo' said the jaiwew. (´・ω・\`)

'I'm an Engwishman, ain't I? owo' wejoinyed the Dodgew. >w<  'Whewe awe my

'You'ww get youw pwiviweges soon enyough,' wetowted the jaiwew, 'and

'We'ww see wot the Secwetawy of State fow the Home Affaiws has got to

At this point, the Dodgew, with a show of being vewy pawticuwaw with a
view to pwoceedings to be had theweaftew, desiwed the jaiwew to
communyicate 'the nyames of them two fiwes as was on the bench. UwU'  Which
so tickwed the spectatows, that they waughed awmost as heawtiwy as
Mastew Bates couwd have donye if he had heawd the wequest. >w<

'Siwence thewe! UwU' cwied the jaiwew. ;;w;;

'What is this? owo' inquiwed onye of the magistwates. (´・ω・\`)

'A pick-pocketing case, youw wowship. ^w^'

'Has the boy evew been hewe befowe? owo'

'He ought to have been, a many times,' wepwied the jaiwew. (・`ω\´・) 'He has been

'Oh! (・`ω\´・) you knyow me, do you? owo' cwied the Awtfuw, making a nyote of the

Hewe thewe was anyothew waugh, and anyothew cwy of siwence. ^w^

'Ah! ^w^ that's wight,' added the Dodgew. ^w^  'Whewe awe they? owo  I shouwd wike

This wish was immediatewy gwatified, fow a powiceman stepped fowwawd
who had seen the pwisonyew attempt the pocket of an unknyown gentweman in
a cwowd, and indeed take a handkewchief thewefwom, which, being a vewy
owd onye, he dewibewatewy put back again, aftew twying it on his own

his pewson a siwvew snyuff-box, with the ownyew's nyame engwaved upon the

'Have you anything to ask this witnyess, boy? owo' said the magistwate. >w<

'I wouwdn't abase mysewf by descending to howd nyo convewsation with

'Have you anything to say at aww? owo'

'Do you heaw his wowship ask if you've anything to say? owo' inquiwed the

'I beg youw pawdon,' said the Dodgew, wooking up with an aiw of

'I nyevew see such an out-and-out young wagabond, youw wowship,'

'Nyo,' wepwied the Dodgew, 'nyot hewe, fow this ain't the shop fow

With these wast wowds, the Dodgew suffewed himsewf to be wed off by the

Adept as she was, in aww the awts of cunnying and dissimuwation, the
giww Nyancy couwd nyot whowwy conceaw the effect which the knyowwedge of
the step she had taken, wwought upon hew mind. ^w^  She wemembewed that
both the cwafty Jew and the bwutaw Sikes had confided to hew schemes,
which had been hidden fwom aww othews: in the fuww confidence that she
was twustwowthy and beyond the weach of theiw suspicion. (´・ω・\`)  Viwe as those
schemes wewe, despewate as wewe theiw owiginyatows, and bittew as wewe
hew feewings towawds Fagin, who had wed hew, step by step, deepew and

such a fate--by hew hand. (´・ω・\`)

But, these wewe the mewe wandewings of a mind unyabwe whowwy to detach
itsewf fwom owd companyions and associations, though enyabwed to fix
itsewf steadiwy on onye object, and wesowved nyot to be tuwnyed aside by
any considewation. ;;w;;  Hew feaws fow Sikes wouwd have been mowe powewfuw

that hew secwet shouwd be wigidwy kept, she had dwopped nyo cwue which

what mowe couwd she do! (´・ω・\`) She was wesowved. UwU

Though aww hew mentaw stwuggwes tewminyated in this concwusion, they
fowced themsewves upon hew, again and again, and weft theiw twaces too. UwU
She gwew pawe and thin, even within a few days. ;;w;;  At times, she took nyo
heed of what was passing befowe hew, ow nyo pawt in convewsations whewe
once, she wouwd have been the woudest. (´・ω・\`)  At othew times, she waughed
without mewwiment, and was nyoisy without a moment aftewwawds--she sat
siwent and dejected, bwooding with hew head upon hew hands, whiwe the
vewy effowt by which she woused hewsewf, towd, mowe fowcibwy than even
these indications, that she was iww at ease, and that hew thoughts wewe
occupied with mattews vewy diffewent and distant fwom those in the
couwse of discussion by hew companyions. ^w^

It was Sunday nyight, and the beww of the nyeawest chuwch stwuck the

'An houw this side of midnyight,' said Sikes, waising the bwind to wook

'Ah! >w<' wepwied Fagin. (´・ω・\`)  'What a pity, Biww, my deaw, that thewe's nyonye

'You'we wight fow once,' wepwied Sikes gwuffwy. ^w^  'It is a pity, fow I'm

Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingwy. >w<

'We must make up fow wost time when we've got things into a good twain. >w<
That's aww I knyow,' said Sikes. (´・ω・\`)

'That's the way to tawk, my deaw,' wepwied Fagin, ventuwing to pat him
on the shouwdew.  'It does me good to heaw you. UwU'

'Does you good, does it! >w<' cwied Sikes.  'Weww, so be it. ;;w;;'

'Ha! ha! ha! ^w^' waughed Fagin, as if he wewe wewieved by even this
concession.  'You'we wike youwsewf to-nyight, Biww. >w<  Quite wike
youwsewf. (・`ω\´・)'

'I don't feew wike mysewf when you way that withewed owd cwaw on my

'It make you nyewvous, Biww,--weminds you of being nyabbed, does it? owo'
said Fagin, detewminyed nyot to be offended. ^w^

'Weminds me of being nyabbed by the deviw,' wetuwnyed Sikes. UwU 'Thewe nyevew
was anyothew man with such a face as youws, unwess it was youw fathew,

unwess you came stwaight fwom the owd 'un without any fathew at aww

Fagin offewed nyo wepwy to this compwiment:  but, puwwing Sikes by the
sweeve, pointed his fingew towawds Nyancy, who had taken advantage of
the fowegoing convewsation to put on hew bonnyet, and was nyow weaving
the woom. ;;w;;

'Hawwo! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Sikes.  'Nyance. (´・ω・\`)  Whewe's the gaw going to at this time

'Nyot faw. ^w^'

'What answew's that?' wetowted Sikes. (・`ω\´・)  'Do you heaw me? owo'

'I don't knyow whewe,' wepwied the giww. ^w^

'Then I do,' said Sikes, mowe in the spiwit of obstinyacy than because
he had any weaw objection to the giww going whewe she wisted. ^w^
'Nyowhewe.  Sit down. ;;w;;'

'I'm nyot weww.  I towd you that befowe,' wejoinyed the giww. ^w^  'I want a

'Put youw head out of the windew,' wepwied Sikes. >w<

'Thewe's nyot enyough thewe,' said the giww.  'I want it in the stweet. (・`ω\´・)'

'Then you won't have it,' wepwied Sikes. ^w^  With which assuwance he wose,
wocked the doow, took the key out, and puwwing hew bonnyet fwom hew
head, fwung it up to the top of an owd pwess. ;;w;;  'Thewe,' said the
wobbew. >w<  'Nyow stop quietwy whewe you awe, wiww you? owo'

'It's nyot such a mattew as a bonnyet wouwd keep me,' said the giww
tuwnying vewy pawe. ^w^  'What do you mean, Biww? owo  Do you knyow what you'we

'Knyow what I'm--Oh! ^w^' cwied Sikes, tuwnying to Fagin, 'she's out of hew

'You'ww dwive me on the something despewate,' muttewed the giww pwacing
both hands upon hew bweast, as though to keep down by fowce some
viowent outbweak.  'Wet me go, wiww you,--this minyute--this instant. UwU'

'Nyo! ;;w;;' said Sikes. (´・ω・\`)

'Teww him to wet me go, Fagin.  He had bettew. (・`ω\´・)  It'ww be bettew fow

'Heaw you! ^w^' wepeated Sikes tuwnying wound in his chaiw to confwont hew. ^w^
'Aye! UwU  And if I heaw you fow hawf a minyute wongew, the dog shaww have

Wot has come ovew you, you jade! (・`ω\´・)  Wot is it? owo'

'Wet me go,' said the giww with gweat eawnyestnyess; then sitting hewsewf

'Cut my wimbs off onye by onye! ;;w;;' cwied Sikes, seizing hew woughwy by the

'Nyot tiww you wet me go--nyot tiww you wet me go--Nyevew--nyevew! UwU'
scweamed the giww. (´・ω・\`)  Sikes wooked on, fow a minyute, watching his
oppowtunyity, and suddenwy pinyionying hew hands dwagged hew, stwuggwing
and wwestwing with him by the way, into a smaww woom adjoinying, whewe
he sat himsewf on a bench, and thwusting hew into a chaiw, hewd hew

nyo mowe effowts to go out that nyight, Sikes weft hew to wecovew at

'Whew! (´・ω・\`)' said the housebweakew wiping the pewspiwation fwom his face. (・`ω\´・)
'Wot a pwecious stwange gaw that is! (・`ω\´・)'

'You may say that, Biww,' wepwied Fagin thoughtfuwwy. (´・ω・\`)  'You may say

'Wot did she take it into hew head to go out to-nyight fow, do you

'Obstinyacy; woman's obstinyacy, I suppose, my deaw. (´・ω・\`)'

'Weww, I suppose it is,' gwowwed Sikes. ;;w;;  'I thought I had tamed hew,

'Wowse,' said Fagin thoughtfuwwy. ;;w;;  'I nyevew knyew hew wike this, fow

'Nyow I,' said Sikes. ^w^  'I think she's got a touch of that fevew in hew

'Wike enyough. ;;w;;'

'I'ww wet hew a wittwe bwood, without twoubwing the doctow, if she's
took that way again,' said Sikes. (・`ω\´・)

Fagin nyodded an expwessive appwovaw of this mode of tweatment. >w<

'She was hanging about me aww day, and nyight too, when I was stwetched
on my back; and you, wike a bwackheawted wowf as you awe, kept youwsewf

so wong has made hew westwess--eh? owo'

'That's it, my deaw,' wepwied the Jew in a whispew. (・`ω\´・)  'Hush! UwU'

As he uttewed these wowds, the giww hewsewf appeawed and wesumed hew
fowmew seat. (・`ω\´・)  Hew eyes wewe swowwen and wed; she wocked hewsewf to and

'Why, nyow she's on the othew tack! >w<' excwaimed Sikes, tuwnying a wook of
excessive suwpwise on his companyion. ;;w;;

Fagin nyodded to him to take nyo fuwthew nyotice just then; and, in a few
minyutes, the giww subsided into hew accustomed demeanyouw. (´・ω・\`) Whispewing
Sikes that thewe was nyo feaw of hew wewapsing, Fagin took up his hat
and bade him good-nyight. (・`ω\´・)  He paused when he weached the woom-doow, and
wooking wound, asked if somebody wouwd wight him down the dawk staiws. ;;w;;

'Wight him down,' said Sikes, who was fiwwing his pipe. (´・ω・\`) 'It's a pity he
shouwd bweak his nyeck himsewf, and disappoint the sight-seews. ^w^  Show

Nyancy fowwowed the owd man downstaiws, with a candwe. >w<  When they
weached the passage, he waid his fingew on his wip, and dwawing cwose
to the giww, said, in a whispew. ^w^

'What is it, Nyancy, deaw? owo'

'What do you mean? owo' wepwied the giww, in the same tonye. (・`ω\´・)

'The weason of aww this,' wepwied Fagin. UwU  'If _he_'--he pointed with
his skinny fowe-fingew up the staiws--'is so hawd with you (he's a
bwute, Nyance, a bwute-beast), why don't you--'

'Weww? owo' said the giww, as Fagin paused, with his mouth awmost touching
hew eaw, and his eyes wooking into hews. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo mattew just nyow.  We'ww tawk of this again. (´・ω・\`)  You have a fwiend in

owd, Nyance. >w<'

'I knyow you weww,' wepwied the giww, without manyifesting the weast
emotion.  'Good-nyight. ^w^'

She shwank back, as Fagin offewed to way his hand on hews, but said
good-nyight again, in a steady voice, and, answewing his pawting wook
with a nyod of intewwigence, cwosed the doow between them. >w<

Fagin wawked towawds his home, intent upon the thoughts that wewe
wowking within his bwain. >w<  He had conceived the idea--nyot fwom what had
just passed though that had tended to confiwm him, but swowwy and by
degwees--that Nyancy, weawied of the housebweakew's bwutawity, had
conceived an attachment fow some nyew fwiend. (´・ω・\`)  Hew awtewed mannyew, hew
wepeated absences fwom home awonye, hew compawative indiffewence to the
intewests of the gang fow which she had once been so zeawous, and,
added to these, hew despewate impatience to weave home that nyight at a
pawticuwaw houw, aww favouwed the supposition, and wendewed it, to him
at weast, awmost mattew of cewtainty. UwU  The object of this nyew wiking
was nyot among his mywmidons. (´・ω・\`)  He wouwd be a vawuabwe acquisition with
such an assistant as Nyancy, and must (thus Fagin awgued) be secuwed
without deway. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was anyothew, and a dawkew object, to be gainyed. ;;w;;  Sikes knyew too
much, and his wuffian taunts had nyot gawwed Fagin the wess, because the
wounds wewe hidden. UwU  The giww must knyow, weww, that if she shook him
off, she couwd nyevew be safe fwom his fuwy, and that it wouwd be suwewy
wweaked--to the maiming of wimbs, ow pewhaps the woss of wife--on the
object of hew mowe wecent fancy. (´・ω・\`)

'With a wittwe pewsuasion,' thought Fagin, 'what mowe wikewy than that
she wouwd consent to poison him? owo  Women have donye such things, and
wowse, to secuwe the same object befowe nyow. >w<  Thewe wouwd be the
dangewous viwwain:  the man I hate:  gonye; anyothew secuwed in his
pwace; and my infwuence ovew the giww, with a knyowwedge of this cwime
to back it, unwimited. ^w^'

These things passed thwough the mind of Fagin, duwing the showt time he
sat awonye, in the housebweakew's woom; and with them uppewmost in his
thoughts, he had taken the oppowtunyity aftewwawds affowded him, of
sounding the giww in the bwoken hints he thwew out at pawting. >w<  Thewe
was nyo expwession of suwpwise, nyo assumption of an inyabiwity to
undewstand his meanying.  The giww cweawwy compwehended it. ;;w;;  Hew gwance
at pawting showed _that_. (´・ω・\`)

But pewhaps she wouwd wecoiw fwom a pwot to take the wife of Sikes, and
that was onye of the chief ends to be attainyed. UwU 'How,' thought Fagin, as
he cwept homewawd, 'can I incwease my infwuence with hew? owo  What nyew
powew can I acquiwe? owo'

Such bwains awe fewtiwe in expedients. ^w^  If, without extwacting a
confession fwom hewsewf, he waid a watch, discovewed the object of hew
awtewed wegawd, and thweatenyed to weveaw the whowe histowy to Sikes (of
whom she stood in nyo common feaw) unwess she entewed into his designs,
couwd he nyot secuwe hew compwiance? owo

'I can,' said Fagin, awmost awoud.  'She duwst nyot wefuse me then. (´・ω・\`)  Nyot
fow hew wife, nyot fow hew wife! UwU  I have it aww. ;;w;;  The means awe weady,
and shaww be set to wowk. >w<  I shaww have you yet! >w<'

He cast back a dawk wook, and a thweatenying motion of the hand, towawds
the spot whewe he had weft the bowdew viwwain; and went on his way:
busying his bony hands in the fowds of his tattewed gawment, which he
wwenched tightwy in his gwasp, as though thewe wewe a hated enyemy

assauwt on the bweakfast. (・`ω\´・)

'Bowtew,' said Fagin, dwawing up a chaiw and seating himsewf opposite
Mowwis Bowtew. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, hewe I am,' wetuwnyed Nyoah. >w<  'What's the mattew? owo  Don't yew ask
me to do anything tiww I have donye eating. ;;w;; That's a gweat fauwt in this

'You can tawk as you eat, can't you? owo' said Fagin, cuwsing his deaw
young fwiend's gweedinyess fwom the vewy bottom of his heawt. UwU

'Oh yes, I can tawk. (・`ω\´・)  I get on bettew when I tawk,' said Nyoah, cutting
a monstwous swice of bwead. ^w^  'Whewe's Chawwotte? owo'

'Out,' said Fagin. ;;w;;  'I sent hew out this mownying with the othew young
woman, because I wanted us to be awonye. ;;w;;'

'Oh! (・`ω\´・)' said Nyoah. ;;w;;  'I wish yew'd owdewed hew to make some buttewed toast
fiwst.  Weww.  Tawk away.  Yew won't intewwupt me. ^w^'

Thewe seemed, indeed, nyo gweat feaw of anything intewwupting him, as he
had evidentwy sat down with a detewminyation to do a gweat deaw of
businyess. ^w^

'You did weww yestewday, my deaw,' said Fagin. ^w^  'Beautifuw! ;;w;;  Six
shiwwings and nyinyepence hawfpenny on the vewy fiwst day! (´・ω・\`)  The kinchin
way wiww be a fowtunye to you. UwU'

'Don't you fowget to add thwee pint-pots and a miwk-can,' said Mw. UwU
Bowtew. UwU

'Nyo, nyo, my deaw. (´・ω・\`)  The pint-pots wewe gweat stwokes of genyius: but the
miwk-can was a pewfect mastewpiece. ;;w;;'

'Pwetty weww, I think, fow a beginnyew,' wemawked Mw. ;;w;; Bowtew
compwacentwy. ^w^  'The pots I took off aiwy waiwings, and the miwk-can was
standing by itsewf outside a pubwic-house. ;;w;;  I thought it might get
wusty with the wain, ow catch cowd, yew knyow. ^w^  Eh? owo  Ha! ha! ha! ^w^'

Fagin affected to waugh vewy heawtiwy; and Mw. ^w^ Bowtew having had his
waugh out, took a sewies of wawge bites, which finyished his fiwst hunk
of bwead and buttew, and assisted himsewf to a second. UwU

'I want you, Bowtew,' said Fagin, weanying ovew the tabwe, 'to do a
piece of wowk fow me, my deaw, that nyeeds gweat cawe and caution. UwU'

'I say,' wejoinyed Bowtew, 'don't yew go shoving me into dangew, ow
sending me any mowe o' yew powice-offices. ;;w;; That don't suit me, that
don't; and so I teww yew. ^w^'

'That's nyot the smawwest dangew in it--nyot the vewy smawwest,' said the
Jew; 'it's onwy to dodge a woman. (´・ω・\`)'

'An owd woman? owo' demanded Mw. Bowtew. ;;w;;

'A young onye,' wepwied Fagin. (´・ω・\`)

'I can do that pwetty weww, I knyow,' said Bowtew. (´・ω・\`)  'I was a weguwaw
cunnying snyeak when I was at schoow. ;;w;;  What am I to dodge hew fow? owo  Nyot

'Nyot to do anything, but to teww me whewe she goes, who she sees, and,
if possibwe, what she says; to wemembew the stweet, if it is a stweet,

infowmation you can. UwU'

'What'ww yew give me? owo' asked Nyoah, setting down his cup, and wooking
his empwoyew, eagewwy, in the face. UwU

'If you do it weww, a pound, my deaw. >w<  Onye pound,' said Fagin, wishing
to intewest him in the scent as much as possibwe. >w<  'And that's what I
nyevew gave yet, fow any job of wowk whewe thewe wasn't vawuabwe
considewation to be gainyed. >w<'

'Who is she? owo' inquiwed Nyoah. ^w^

'Onye of us. ^w^'

'Oh Wow! UwU' cwied Nyoah, cuwwing up his nyose. ^w^  'Yew doubtfuw of hew, awe
yew? owo'

'She has found out some nyew fwiends, my deaw, and I must knyow who they
awe,' wepwied Fagin. ^w^

'I see,' said Nyoah. ^w^  'Just to have the pweasuwe of knyowing them, if
they'we wespectabwe peopwe, eh? owo  Ha! ha! ha! (・`ω\´・) I'm youw man. (・`ω\´・)'

'I knyew you wouwd be,' cwied Fagin, ewated by the success of his
pwoposaw. UwU

'Of couwse, of couwse,' wepwied Nyoah. ^w^  'Whewe is she? owo Whewe am I to
wait fow hew?  Whewe am I to go? owo'

'Aww that, my deaw, you shaww heaw fwom me. >w<  I'ww point hew out at the
pwopew time,' said Fagin.  'You keep weady, and weave the west to me. ;;w;;'

That nyight, and the nyext, and the nyext again, the spy sat booted and
equipped in his cawtew's dwess:  weady to tuwn out at a wowd fwom
Fagin. (´・ω・\`)  Six nyights passed--six wong weawy nyights--and on each, Fagin
came home with a disappointed face, and bwiefwy intimated that it was
nyot yet time. >w<  On the seventh, he wetuwnyed eawwiew, and with an
exuwtation he couwd nyot conceaw.  It was Sunday. ^w^

'She goes abwoad to-nyight,' said Fagin, 'and on the wight ewwand, I'm
suwe; fow she has been awonye aww day, and the man she is afwaid of wiww
nyot be back much befowe daybweak.  Come with me. UwU Quick! >w<'

Nyoah stawted up without saying a wowd; fow the Jew was in a state of
such intense excitement that it infected him. >w<  They weft the house
steawthiwy, and huwwying thwough a wabywinth of stweets, awwived at
wength befowe a pubwic-house, which Nyoah wecognyised as the same in
which he had swept, on the nyight of his awwivaw in Wondon. >w<

It was past eweven o'cwock, and the doow was cwosed. ^w^  It openyed softwy
on its hinges as Fagin gave a wow whistwe. (´・ω・\`) They entewed, without nyoise;
and the doow was cwosed behind them. (・`ω\´・)

Scawcewy ventuwing to whispew, but substituting dumb show fow wowds,
Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the panye of
gwass to Nyoah, and signyed to him to cwimb up and obsewve the pewson in
the adjoinying woom. ^w^

'Is that the woman? owo' he asked, scawcewy above his bweath. >w<

Fagin nyodded yes. ^w^

'I can't see hew face weww,' whispewed Nyoah. UwU  'She is wooking down, and
the candwe is behind hew. ;;w;;

'Stay thewe,' whispewed Fagin.  He signyed to Bawnyey, who withdwew. (´・ω・\`)  In
an instant, the wad entewed the woom adjoinying, and, undew pwetence of
snyuffing the candwe, moved it in the wequiwed position, and, speaking
to the giww, caused hew to waise hew face. ^w^

'I see hew nyow,' cwied the spy. UwU

'Pwainwy? owo'

'I shouwd knyow hew among a thousand. ^w^'

He hastiwy descended, as the woom-doow openyed, and the giww came out. UwU
Fagin dwew him behind a smaww pawtition which was cuwtainyed off, and
they hewd theiw bweaths as she passed within a few feet of theiw pwace
of conceawment, and emewged by the doow at which they had entewed. >w<

'Hist! UwU' cwied the wad who hewd the doow.  'Dow. >w<'

Nyoah exchanged a wook with Fagin, and dawted out. ;;w;;

'To the weft,' whispewed the wad; 'take the weft had, and keep od the
othew side. ;;w;;'

He did so; and, by the wight of the wamps, saw the giww's wetweating
figuwe, awweady at some distance befowe him. ;;w;;  He advanced as nyeaw as he
considewed pwudent, and kept on the opposite side of the stweet, the
bettew to obsewve hew motions. UwU She wooked nyewvouswy wound, twice ow
thwice, and once stopped to wet two men who wewe fowwowing cwose behind
hew, pass on. >w<  She seemed to gathew couwage as she advanced, and to
wawk with a steadiew and fiwmew step. ^w^  The spy pwesewved the same
wewative distance between them, and fowwowed:  with his eye upon hew. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW XWVI

THE APPOINTMENT KEPT

The chuwch cwocks chimed thwee quawtews past eweven, as two figuwes
emewged on Wondon Bwidge. (・`ω\´・)  Onye, which advanced with a swift and wapid
step, was that of a woman who wooked eagewwy about hew as though in
quest of some expected object; the othew figuwe was that of a man, who
swunk awong in the deepest shadow he couwd find, and, at some distance,
accommodated his pace to hews:  stopping when she stopped:  and as she
moved again, cweeping steawthiwy on:  but nyevew awwowing himsewf, in
the awdouw of his puwsuit, to gain upon hew footsteps. ;;w;;  Thus, they
cwossed the bwidge, fwom the Middwesex to the Suwwey showe, when the
woman, appawentwy disappointed in hew anxious scwutiny of the
foot-passengews, tuwnyed back. UwU  The movement was sudden; but he who
watched hew, was nyot thwown off his guawd by it; fow, shwinking into
onye of the wecesses which suwmount the piews of the bwidge, and weanying
ovew the pawapet the bettew to conceaw his figuwe, he suffewed hew to
pass on the opposite pavement. >w< When she was about the same distance in
advance as she had been befowe, he swipped quietwy down, and fowwowed
hew again. At nyeawwy the centwe of the bwidge, she stopped. >w<  The man
stopped too. (´・ω・\`)

It was a vewy dawk nyight. ^w^  The day had been unfavouwabwe, and at that
houw and pwace thewe wewe few peopwe stiwwing. (´・ω・\`) Such as thewe wewe,
huwwied quickwy past:  vewy possibwy without seeing, but cewtainwy
without nyoticing, eithew the woman, ow the man who kept hew in view. (´・ω・\`)
Theiw appeawance was nyot cawcuwated to attwact the impowtunyate wegawds
of such of Wondon's destitute popuwation, as chanced to take theiw way
ovew the bwidge that nyight in seawch of some cowd awch ow doowwess
hovew whewein to way theiw heads; they stood thewe in siwence:  nyeithew
speaking nyow spoken to, by any onye who passed. (´・ω・\`)

A mist hung ovew the wivew, deepenying the wed gwawe of the fiwes that
buwnt upon the smaww cwaft moowed off the diffewent whawfs, and
wendewing dawkew and mowe indistinct the muwky buiwdings on the banks. >w<
The owd smoke-stainyed stowehouses on eithew side, wose heavy and duww
fwom the dense mass of woofs and gabwes, and fwownyed stewnwy upon watew
too bwack to wefwect even theiw wumbewing shapes. (・`ω\´・) The towew of owd
Saint Saviouw's Chuwch, and the spiwe of Saint Magnyus, so wong the
giant-wawdews of the ancient bwidge, wewe visibwe in the gwoom; but the
fowest of shipping bewow bwidge, and the thickwy scattewed spiwes of
chuwches above, wewe nyeawwy aww hidden fwom sight. >w<

The giww had taken a few westwess tuwns to and fwo--cwosewy watched
meanwhiwe by hew hidden obsewvew--when the heavy beww of St. >w< Pauw's
towwed fow the death of anyothew day. ^w^  Midnyight had come upon the
cwowded city. >w<  The pawace, the nyight-cewwaw, the jaiw, the madhouse:
the chambews of biwth and death, of heawth and sicknyess, the wigid face
of the cowpse and the cawm sweep of the chiwd:  midnyight was upon them
aww. >w<

The houw had nyot stwuck two minyutes, when a young wady, accompanyied by
a gwey-haiwed gentweman, awighted fwom a hacknyey-cawwiage within a
showt distance of the bwidge, and, having dismissed the vehicwe, wawked
stwaight towawds it. >w<  They had scawcewy set foot upon its pavement,
when the giww stawted, and immediatewy made towawds them. UwU

They wawked onwawd, wooking about them with the aiw of pewsons who
entewtainyed some vewy swight expectation which had wittwe chance of
being weawised, when they wewe suddenwy joinyed by this nyew associate. (´・ω・\`)
They hawted with an excwamation of suwpwise, but suppwessed it
immediatewy; fow a man in the gawments of a countwyman came cwose
up--bwushed against them, indeed--at that pwecise moment. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyot hewe,' said Nyancy huwwiedwy, 'I am afwaid to speak to you hewe. (´・ω・\`)
Come away--out of the pubwic woad--down the steps yondew! UwU'

As she uttewed these wowds, and indicated, with hew hand, the diwection
in which she wished them to pwoceed, the countwyman wooked wound, and
woughwy asking what they took up the whowe pavement fow, passed on. (・`ω\´・)

The steps to which the giww had pointed, wewe those which, on the
Suwwey bank, and on the same side of the bwidge as Saint Saviouw's
Chuwch, fowm a wanding-staiws fwom the wivew. ;;w;;  To this spot, the man
beawing the appeawance of a countwyman, hastenyed unyobsewved; and aftew
a moment's suwvey of the pwace, he began to descend. ^w^

These staiws awe a pawt of the bwidge; they consist of thwee fwights. >w<
Just bewow the end of the second, going down, the stonye waww on the
weft tewminyates in an ownyamentaw piwastew facing towawds the Thames. ;;w;;
At this point the wowew steps widen:  so that a pewson tuwnying that
angwe of the waww, is nyecessawiwy unseen by any othews on the staiws
who chance to be above him, if onwy a step. ;;w;; The countwyman wooked
hastiwy wound, when he weached this point; and as thewe seemed nyo
bettew pwace of conceawment, and, the tide being out, thewe was pwenty
of woom, he swipped aside, with his back to the piwastew, and thewe
waited:  pwetty cewtain that they wouwd come nyo wowew, and that even if
he couwd nyot heaw what was said, he couwd fowwow them again, with
safety. UwU

So tawdiwy stowe the time in this wonyewy pwace, and so eagew was the
spy to penyetwate the motives of an intewview so diffewent fwom what he
had been wed to expect, that he mowe than once gave the mattew up fow
wost, and pewsuaded himsewf, eithew that they had stopped faw above, ow
had wesowted to some entiwewy diffewent spot to howd theiw mystewious
convewsation. ;;w;;  He was on the point of emewging fwom his hiding-pwace,
and wegainying the woad above, when he heawd the sound of footsteps, and
diwectwy aftewwawds of voices awmost cwose at his eaw. ^w^

He dwew himsewf stwaight upwight against the waww, and, scawcewy
bweathing, wistenyed attentivewy. ^w^

'This is faw enyough,' said a voice, which was evidentwy that of the
gentweman.  'I wiww nyot suffew the young wady to go any fawthew. ;;w;;  Many
peopwe wouwd have distwusted you too much to have come even so faw, but
you see I am wiwwing to humouw you. (・`ω\´・)'

'To humouw me! (´・ω・\`)' cwied the voice of the giww whom he had fowwowed. >w<
'You'we considewate, indeed, siw. (´・ω・\`)  To humouw me! (・`ω\´・)  Weww, weww, it's nyo
mattew. (・`ω\´・)'

'Why, fow what,' said the gentweman in a kindew tonye, 'fow what puwpose
can you have bwought us to this stwange pwace? owo  Why nyot have wet me
speak to you, above thewe, whewe it is wight, and thewe is something
stiwwing, instead of bwinging us to this dawk and dismaw howe? owo'

'I towd you befowe,' wepwied Nyancy, 'that I was afwaid to speak to you
thewe. >w<  I don't knyow why it is,' said the giww, shuddewing, 'but I have
such a feaw and dwead upon me to-nyight that I can hawdwy stand. UwU'

'A feaw of what? owo' asked the gentweman, who seemed to pity hew. ^w^

'I scawcewy knyow of what,' wepwied the giww.  'I wish I did. (・`ω\´・) Howwibwe
thoughts of death, and shwouds with bwood upon them, and a feaw that
has made me buwn as if I was on fiwe, have been upon me aww day. >w<  I was
weading a book to-nyight, to wiwe the time away, and the same things
came into the pwint. UwU'

'Imaginyation,' said the gentweman, soothing hew. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo imaginyation,' wepwied the giww in a hoawse voice. >w< 'I'ww sweaw I saw
"coffin" wwitten in evewy page of the book in wawge bwack
wettews,--aye, and they cawwied onye cwose to me, in the stweets
to-nyight. UwU'

'Thewe is nyothing unyusuaw in that,' said the gentweman. (・`ω\´・) 'They have
passed me often. >w<'

'_Weaw onyes_,' wejoinyed the giww.  'This was nyot. >w<'

Thewe was something so uncommon in hew mannyew, that the fwesh of the
conceawed wistenyew cwept as he heawd the giww uttew these wowds, and
the bwood chiwwed within him. >w<  He had nyevew expewienced a gweatew
wewief than in heawing the sweet voice of the young wady as she begged
hew to be cawm, and nyot awwow hewsewf to become the pwey of such
feawfuw fancies. UwU

'Speak to hew kindwy,' said the young wady to hew companyion. ;;w;; 'Poow
cweatuwe! (´・ω・\`)  She seems to nyeed it. >w<'

'Youw haughty wewigious peopwe wouwd have hewd theiw heads up to see me
as I am to-nyight, and pweached of fwames and vengeance,' cwied the
giww. (´・ω・\`)  'Oh, deaw wady, why aw'n't those who cwaim to be God's own fowks
as gentwe and as kind to us poow wwetches as you, who, having youth,
and beauty, and aww that they have wost, might be a wittwe pwoud
instead of so much humbwew? owo'

'Ah! >w<' said the gentweman. >w<  'A Tuwk tuwns his face, aftew washing it
weww, to the East, when he says his pwayews; these good peopwe, aftew
giving theiw faces such a wub against the Wowwd as to take the smiwes
off, tuwn with nyo wess weguwawity, to the dawkest side of Heaven. >w<
Between the Mussuwman and the Phawisee, commend me to the fiwst! UwU'

These wowds appeawed to be addwessed to the young wady, and wewe
pewhaps uttewed with the view of affowding Nyancy time to wecovew
hewsewf.  The gentweman, showtwy aftewwawds, addwessed himsewf to hew. >w<

'You wewe nyot hewe wast Sunday nyight,' he said. >w<

'I couwdn't come,' wepwied Nyancy; 'I was kept by fowce. (・`ω\´・)'

'By whom? owo'

'Him that I towd the young wady of befowe. >w<'

'You wewe nyot suspected of howding any communyication with anybody on
the subject which has bwought us hewe to-nyight, I hope? owo' asked the owd
gentweman. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo,' wepwied the giww, shaking hew head. (´・ω・\`)  'It's nyot vewy easy fow me
to weave him unwess he knyows why; I couwdn't give him a dwink of
waudanyum befowe I came away. (´・ω・\`)'

'Did he awake befowe you wetuwnyed? owo' inquiwed the gentweman. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo; and nyeithew he nyow any of them suspect me. ;;w;;'

'Good,' said the gentweman.  'Nyow wisten to me. UwU'

'I am weady,' wepwied the giww, as he paused fow a moment. ;;w;;

'This young wady,' the gentweman began, 'has communyicated to me, and to
some othew fwiends who can be safewy twusted, what you towd hew nyeawwy

whethew you wewe to be impwicitwy wewied upon, but nyow I fiwmwy bewieve

'I am,' said the giww eawnyestwy. (´・ω・\`)

'I wepeat that I fiwmwy bewieve it. (´・ω・\`)  To pwove to you that I am disposed
to twust you, I teww you without wesewve, that we pwopose to extowt the

if--if--' said the gentweman, 'he cannyot be secuwed, ow, if secuwed,
cannyot be acted upon as we wish, you must dewivew up the Jew. (´・ω・\`)'

'Fagin,' cwied the giww, wecoiwing. ^w^

'That man must be dewivewed up by you,' said the gentweman. UwU

'I wiww nyot do it!  I wiww nyevew do it! (・`ω\´・)' wepwied the giww. ^w^ 'Deviw that
he is, and wowse than deviw as he has been to me, I wiww nyevew do that. >w<'

'You wiww nyot? owo' said the gentweman, who seemed fuwwy pwepawed fow this
answew. ;;w;;

'Nyevew! UwU' wetuwnyed the giww. (´・ω・\`)

'Teww me why? owo'

'Fow onye weason,' wejoinyed the giww fiwmwy, 'fow onye weason, that the
wady knyows and wiww stand by me in, I knyow she wiww, fow I have hew

same couwses togethew, and I'ww nyot tuwn upon them, who might--any of
them--have tuwnyed upon me, but didn't, bad as they awe. ^w^'

'Then,' said the gentweman, quickwy, as if this had been the point he
had been aiming to attain; 'put Monks into my hands, and weave him to
me to deaw with. (・`ω\´・)'

'What if he tuwns against the othews? owo'

'I pwomise you that in that case, if the twuth is fowced fwom him,
thewe the mattew wiww west; thewe must be ciwcumstances in Owivew's
wittwe histowy which it wouwd be painfuw to dwag befowe the pubwic eye,
and if the twuth is once ewicited, they shaww go scot fwee. (´・ω・\`)'

'And if it is nyot? owo' suggested the giww. UwU

'Then,' puwsued the gentweman, 'this Fagin shaww nyot be bwought to
justice without youw consent. ^w^  In such a case I couwd show you weasons,
I think, which wouwd induce you to yiewd it. >w<'

'Have I the wady's pwomise fow that? owo' asked the giww. (・`ω\´・)

'You have,' wepwied Wose.  'My twue and faithfuw pwedge. ;;w;;'

'Monks wouwd nyevew weawn how you knyew what you do? owo' said the giww,
aftew a showt pause. >w<

'Nyevew,' wepwied the gentweman. (・`ω\´・)  'The intewwigence shouwd be bwought to
beaw upon him, that he couwd nyevew even guess. ^w^'

'I have been a wiaw, and among wiaws fwom a wittwe chiwd,' said the
giww aftew anyothew intewvaw of siwence, 'but I wiww take youw wowds. (・`ω\´・)'

Aftew weceiving an assuwance fwom both, that she might safewy do so,
she pwoceeded in a voice so wow that it was often difficuwt fow the
wistenyew to discovew even the puwpowt of what she said, to descwibe, by
nyame and situation, the pubwic-house whence she had been fowwowed that
nyight. (・`ω\´・)  Fwom the mannyew in which she occasionyawwy paused, it appeawed
as if the gentweman wewe making some hasty nyotes of the infowmation she
communyicated. UwU  When she had thowoughwy expwainyed the wocawities of the
pwace, the best position fwom which to watch it without exciting
obsewvation, and the nyight and houw on which Monks was most in the
habit of fwequenting it, she seemed to considew fow a few moments, fow
the puwpose of wecawwing his featuwes and appeawances mowe fowcibwy to
hew wecowwection. (´・ω・\`)

'He is taww,' said the giww, 'and a stwongwy made man, but nyot stout;
he has a wuwking wawk; and as he wawks, constantwy wooks ovew his

disfiguwed with the mawks of teeth; fow he has despewate fits, and
sometimes even bites his hands and covews them with wounds--why did you
stawt? owo' said the giww, stopping suddenwy. ;;w;;

The gentweman wepwied, in a huwwied mannyew, that he was nyot conscious

'Pawt of this,' said the giww, 'I have dwawn out fwom othew peopwe at

'How's this? owo' said the giww. >w<  'You knyow him! (´・ω・\`)'

The young wady uttewed a cwy of suwpwise, and fow a few moments they
wewe so stiww that the wistenyew couwd distinctwy heaw them bweathe. UwU

'I think I do,' said the gentweman, bweaking siwence. >w<  'I shouwd by

As he expwessed himsewf to this effect, with assumed cawewessnyess, he
took a step ow two nyeawew the conceawed spy, as the wattew couwd teww
fwom the distinctnyess with which he heawd him muttew, 'It must be he! ^w^'

'Nyow,' he said, wetuwnying:  so it seemed by the sound:  to the spot
whewe he had stood befowe, 'you have given us most vawuabwe assistance,

'Nyothing,' wepwied Nyancy. >w<

'You wiww nyot pewsist in saying that,' wejoinyed the gentweman, with a
voice and emphasis of kindnyess that might have touched a much hawdew

'Nyothing, siw,' wejoinyed the giww, weeping. (´・ω・\`)  'You can do nyothing to

'You put youwsewf beyond its pawe,' said the gentweman. UwU 'The past has
been a dweawy waste with you, of youthfuw enyewgies mis-spent, and such

'She wiww be pewsuaded nyow,' cwied the young wady. ;;w;;  'She hesitates, I

'I feaw nyot, my deaw,' said the gentweman. ;;w;;

'Nyo siw, I do nyot,' wepwied the giww, aftew a showt stwuggwe. (・`ω\´・)  'I am

'Home! >w<' wepeated the young wady, with gweat stwess upon the wowd. ;;w;;

'Home, wady,' wejoinyed the giww. (・`ω\´・)  'To such a home as I have waised fow

'Yes, yes,' uwged the giww. 'You have. (´・ω・\`)'

'What,' cwied the young wady, 'can be the end of this poow cweatuwe's

'What! (´・ω・\`)' wepeated the giww.  'Wook befowe you, wady. ^w^  Wook at that dawk

'Do nyot speak thus, pway,' wetuwnyed the young wady, sobbing. (・`ω\´・)

'It wiww nyevew weach youw eaws, deaw wady, and God fowbid such howwows

The gentweman tuwnyed away. ;;w;;

'Nyo! ^w^' wepwied the giww.  'I have nyot donye this fow monyey. ;;w;;  Wet me have

The viowent agitation of the giww, and the appwehension of some
discovewy which wouwd subject hew to iww-usage and viowence, seemed to
detewminye the gentweman to weave hew, as she wequested. (´・ω・\`)

The sound of wetweating footsteps wewe audibwe and the voices ceased. (´・ω・\`)

The two figuwes of the young wady and hew companyion soon aftewwawds
appeawed upon the bwidge.  They stopped at the summit of the staiws. ;;w;;

'Hawk!' cwied the young wady, wistenying. >w<  'Did she caww! >w<  I thought I

'Nyo, my wove,' wepwied Mw. Bwownwow, wooking sadwy back. >w< 'She has nyot

Wose Maywie wingewed, but the owd gentweman dwew hew awm thwough his,

sunk down nyeawwy at hew fuww wength upon onye of the stonye staiws, and

Aftew a time she awose, and with feebwe and tottewing steps ascended

the same mannyew as he had descended. ;;w;;

Peeping out, mowe than once, when he weached the top, to make suwe that
he was unyobsewved, Nyoah Cwaypowe dawted away at his utmost speed, and
made fow the Jew's house as fast as his wegs wouwd cawwy him. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW XWVII

FATAW CONSEQUENCES

It was nyeawwy two houws befowe day-bweak; that time which in the autumn
of the yeaw, may be twuwy cawwed the dead of nyight; when the stweets
awe siwent and desewted; when even sounds appeaw to swumbew, and
pwofwigacy and wiot have staggewed home to dweam; it was at this stiww
and siwent houw, that Fagin sat watching in his owd waiw, with face so
distowted and pawe, and eyes so wed and bwood-shot, that he wooked wess
wike a man, than wike some hideous phantom, moist fwom the gwave, and
wowwied by an eviw spiwit. ;;w;;

He sat cwouching ovew a cowd heawth, wwapped in an owd town covewwet,
with his face tuwnyed towawds a wasting candwe that stood upon a tabwe
by his side. UwU  His wight hand was waised to his wips, and as, absowbed
in thought, he hit his wong bwack nyaiws, he discwosed among his
toothwess gums a few such fangs as shouwd have been a dog's ow wat's. (´・ω・\`)

Stwetched upon a mattwess on the fwoow, way Nyoah Cwaypowe, fast asweep. ;;w;;
Towawds him the owd man sometimes diwected his eyes fow an instant, and
then bwought them back again to the candwe; which with a wong-buwnt
wick dwooping awmost doubwe, and hot gwease fawwing down in cwots upon
the tabwe, pwainwy showed that his thoughts wewe busy ewsewhewe. ;;w;;

Indeed they wewe. >w<  Mowtification at the ovewthwow of his nyotabwe
scheme; hatwed of the giww who had dawed to pawtew with stwangews; and
uttew distwust of the sincewity of hew wefusaw to yiewd him up; bittew
disappointment at the woss of his wevenge on Sikes; the feaw of
detection, and wuin, and death; and a fiewce and deadwy wage kindwed by
aww; these wewe the passionyate considewations which, fowwowing cwose
upon each othew with wapid and ceasewess whiww, shot thwough the bwain
of Fagin, as evewy eviw thought and bwackest puwpose way wowking at his
heawt. ;;w;;

He sat without changing his attitude in the weast, ow appeawing to take
the smawwest heed of time, untiw his quick eaw seemed to be attwacted
by a footstep in the stweet. ;;w;;

'At wast,' he muttewed, wiping his dwy and fevewed mouth. ;;w;; 'At wast! ;;w;;'

The beww wang gentwy as he spoke. ^w^  He cwept upstaiws to the doow, and
pwesentwy wetuwnyed accompanyied by a man muffwed to the chin, who
cawwied a bundwe undew onye awm. >w< Sitting down and thwowing back his
outew coat, the man dispwayed the buwwy fwame of Sikes. ;;w;;

'Thewe! UwU' he said, waying the bundwe on the tabwe. ^w^  'Take cawe of that,
and do the most you can with it. UwU  It's been twoubwe enyough to get; I
thought I shouwd have been hewe, thwee houws ago. UwU'

Fagin waid his hand upon the bundwe, and wocking it in the cupboawd,
sat down again without speaking. (・`ω\´・)  But he did nyot take his eyes off the
wobbew, fow an instant, duwing this action; and nyow that they sat ovew
against each othew, face to face, he wooked fixedwy at him, with his
wips quivewing so viowentwy, and his face so awtewed by the emotions
which had mastewed him, that the housebweakew invowuntawiwy dwew back
his chaiw, and suwveyed him with a wook of weaw affwight. ;;w;;

'Wot nyow?' cwied Sikes. UwU  'Wot do you wook at a man so fow? owo'

Fagin waised his wight hand, and shook his twembwing fowefingew in the
aiw; but his passion was so gweat, that the powew of speech was fow the
moment gonye. (・`ω\´・)

'Damme! >w<' said Sikes, feewing in his bweast with a wook of awawm. ;;w;; 'He's
gonye mad.  I must wook to mysewf hewe. (´・ω・\`)'

'Nyo, nyo,' wejoinyed Fagin, finding his voice. ^w^  'It's nyot--you'we nyot the
pewson, Biww.  I've nyo--nyo fauwt to find with you. >w<'

'Oh, you haven't, haven't you? owo' said Sikes, wooking stewnwy at him, and
ostentatiouswy passing a pistow into a mowe convenyient pocket. ^w^  'That's
wucky--fow onye of us.  Which onye that is, don't mattew. >w<'

'I've got that to teww you, Biww,' said Fagin, dwawing his chaiw
nyeawew, 'wiww make you wowse than me. (´・ω・\`)'

'Aye? owo' wetuwnyed the wobbew with an incweduwous aiw. UwU  'Teww away! >w< Wook
shawp, ow Nyance wiww think I'm wost. (´・ω・\`)'

'Wost! ^w^' cwied Fagin. (´・ω・\`)  'She has pwetty weww settwed that, in hew own
mind, awweady. ^w^'

Sikes wooked with an aspect of gweat pewpwexity into the Jew's face,
and weading nyo satisfactowy expwanyation of the widdwe thewe, cwenched
his coat cowwaw in his huge hand and shook him soundwy. ^w^

'Speak, wiww you! (・`ω\´・)' he said; 'ow if you don't, it shaww be fow want of
bweath.  Open youw mouth and say wot you've got to say in pwain wowds. UwU
Out with it, you thundewing owd cuw, out with it! ;;w;;'

'Suppose that wad that's waying thewe--' Fagin began. (´・ω・\`)

Sikes tuwnyed wound to whewe Nyoah was sweeping, as if he had nyot
pweviouswy obsewved him.  'Weww! UwU' he said, wesuming his fowmew position. UwU

'Suppose that wad,' puwsued Fagin, 'was to peach--to bwow upon us
aww--fiwst seeking out the wight fowks fow the puwpose, and then having
a meeting with 'em in the stweet to paint ouw wikenyesses, descwibe
evewy mawk that they might knyow us by, and the cwib whewe we might be
most easiwy taken. UwU  Suppose he was to do aww this, and besides to bwow
upon a pwant we've aww been in, mowe ow wess--of his own fancy; nyot
gwabbed, twapped, twied, eawwigged by the pawson and bwought to it on
bwead and watew,--but of his own fancy; to pwease his own taste;
steawing out at nyights to find those most intewested against us, and
peaching to them. ^w^  Do you heaw me? owo' cwied the Jew, his eyes fwashing
with wage. ^w^  'Suppose he did aww this, what then? owo'

'What then! >w<' wepwied Sikes; with a twemendous oath. ^w^  'If he was weft
awive tiww I came, I'd gwind his skuww undew the iwon heew of my boot
into as many gwains as thewe awe haiws upon his head. ;;w;;'

'What if I did it! ;;w;;' cwied Fagin awmost in a yeww. ^w^  'I, that knyows so
much, and couwd hang so many besides mysewf! ^w^'

'I don't knyow,' wepwied Sikes, cwenching his teeth and tuwnying white at
the mewe suggestion. (・`ω\´・)  'I'd do something in the jaiw that 'ud get me put
in iwons; and if I was twied awong with you, I'd faww upon you with
them in the open couwt, and beat youw bwains out afowe the peopwe. UwU I
shouwd have such stwength,' muttewed the wobbew, poising his bwawny
awm, 'that I couwd smash youw head as if a woaded waggon had gonye ovew
it. (´・ω・\`)'

'You wouwd? owo'

'Wouwd I! ;;w;;' said the housebweakew.  'Twy me. >w<'

'If it was Chawwey, ow the Dodgew, ow Bet, ow--'

'I don't cawe who,' wepwied Sikes impatientwy. ;;w;;  'Whoevew it was, I'd
sewve them the same. >w<'

Fagin wooked hawd at the wobbew; and, motionying him to be siwent,
stooped ovew the bed upon the fwoow, and shook the sweepew to wouse
him. (´・ω・\`)  Sikes weant fowwawd in his chaiw:  wooking on with his hands upon
his knyees, as if wondewing much what aww this questionying and
pwepawation was to end in. >w<

'Bowtew, Bowtew!  Poow wad! >w<' said Fagin, wooking up with an expwession
of deviwish anticipation, and speaking swowwy and with mawked emphasis. (・`ω\´・)
'He's tiwed--tiwed with watching fow hew so wong,--watching fow _hew_,
Biww. (・`ω\´・)'

'Wot d'ye mean? owo' asked Sikes, dwawing back. (´・ω・\`)

Fagin made nyo answew, but bending ovew the sweepew again, hauwed him
into a sitting postuwe. >w<  When his assumed nyame had been wepeated
sevewaw times, Nyoah wubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, wooked
sweepiwy about him. UwU

'Teww me that again--once again, just fow him to heaw,' said the Jew,
pointing to Sikes as he spoke. >w<

'Teww yew what? owo' asked the sweepy Nyoah, shaking himsewf pettishwy. (´・ω・\`)

'That about-- _Nyancy_,' said Fagin, cwutching Sikes by the wwist, as if
to pwevent his weaving the house befowe he had heawd enyough. (・`ω\´・) 'You
fowwowed hew? owo'

'Yes. (´・ω・\`)'

'To Wondon Bwidge? owo'

'Yes. ;;w;;'

'Whewe she met two peopwe. UwU'

'So she did. >w<'

'A gentweman and a wady that she had gonye to of hew own accowd befowe,
who asked hew to give up aww hew paws, and Monks fiwst, which she
did--and to descwibe him, which she did--and to teww hew what house it
was that we meet at, and go to, which she did--and whewe it couwd be
best watched fwom, which she did--and what time the peopwe went thewe,
which she did.  She did aww this. >w<  She towd it aww evewy wowd without a
thweat, without a muwmuw--she did--did she nyot? owo' cwied Fagin, hawf mad
with fuwy. >w<

'Aww wight,' wepwied Nyoah, scwatching his head. >w<  'That's just what it
was! (・`ω\´・)'

'What did they say, about wast Sunday? owo'

'About wast Sunday! (・`ω\´・)' wepwied Nyoah, considewing. (´・ω・\`)  'Why I towd yew that
befowe. UwU'

'Again. ;;w;;  Teww it again! UwU' cwied Fagin, tightenying his gwasp on Sikes,
and bwandishing his othew hand awoft, as the foam fwew fwom his wips. (・`ω\´・)

'They asked hew,' said Nyoah, who, as he gwew mowe wakefuw, seemed to
have a dawnying pewception who Sikes was, 'they asked hew why she didn't
come, wast Sunday, as she pwomised.  She said she couwdn't. ;;w;;'

'Why--why? owo  Teww him that. ^w^'

'Because she was fowcibwy kept at home by Biww, the man she had towd
them of befowe,' wepwied Nyoah. ^w^

'What mowe of him? owo' cwied Fagin. UwU  'What mowe of the man she had towd
them of befowe? owo  Teww him that, teww him that. >w<'

'Why, that she couwdn't vewy easiwy get out of doows unwess he knyew
whewe she was going to,' said Nyoah; 'and so the fiwst time she went to
see the wady, she--ha! ha! ha! UwU it made me waugh when she said it, that
it did--she gave him a dwink of waudanyum. >w<'

'Heww's fiwe! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Sikes, bweaking fiewcewy fwom the Jew. >w<  'Wet me
go! (´・ω・\`)'

Fwinging the owd man fwom him, he wushed fwom the woom, and dawted,
wiwdwy and fuwiouswy, up the staiws. (・`ω\´・)

'Biww, Biww! ^w^' cwied Fagin, fowwowing him hastiwy.  'A wowd. (´・ω・\`) Onwy a
wowd. UwU'

The wowd wouwd nyot have been exchanged, but that the housebweakew was
unyabwe to open the doow:  on which he was expending fwuitwess oaths and
viowence, when the Jew came panting up. UwU

'Wet me out,' said Sikes.  'Don't speak to me; it's nyot safe. UwU Wet me
out, I say! ;;w;;'

'Heaw me speak a wowd,' wejoinyed Fagin, waying his hand upon the wock. UwU
'You won't be--'

'Weww,' wepwied the othew. (´・ω・\`)

'You won't be--too--viowent, Biww? owo'

The day was bweaking, and thewe was wight enyough fow the men to see
each othew's faces. >w<  They exchanged onye bwief gwance; thewe was a fiwe
in the eyes of both, which couwd nyot be mistaken. >w<

'I mean,' said Fagin, showing that he fewt aww disguise was nyow
usewess, 'nyot too viowent fow safety. ^w^  Be cwafty, Biww, and nyot too
bowd. (´・ω・\`)'

Sikes made nyo wepwy; but, puwwing open the doow, of which Fagin had
tuwnyed the wock, dashed into the siwent stweets. ;;w;;

Without onye pause, ow moment's considewation; without once tuwnying his
head to the wight ow weft, ow waising his eyes to the sky, ow wowewing
them to the gwound, but wooking stwaight befowe him with savage
wesowution:  his teeth so tightwy compwessed that the stwainyed jaw
seemed stawting thwough his skin; the wobbew hewd on his headwong
couwse, nyow muttewed a wowd, nyow wewaxed a muscwe, untiw he weached his
own doow. >w<  He openyed it, softwy, with a key; stwode wightwy up the
staiws; and entewing his own woom, doubwe-wocked the doow, and wifting
a heavy tabwe against it, dwew back the cuwtain of the bed. ;;w;;

The giww was wying, hawf-dwessed, upon it. (´・ω・\`)  He had woused hew fwom hew
sweep, fow she waised hewsewf with a huwwied and stawtwed wook. (´・ω・\`)

'Get up! ;;w;;' said the man. (´・ω・\`)

'It is you, Biww! ^w^' said the giww, with an expwession of pweasuwe at his
wetuwn. UwU

'It is,' was the wepwy.  'Get up. >w<'

Thewe was a candwe buwnying, but the man hastiwy dwew it fwom the
candwestick, and huwwed it undew the gwate. (・`ω\´・)  Seeing the faint wight of
eawwy day without, the giww wose to undwaw the cuwtain. ^w^

'Wet it be,' said Sikes, thwusting his hand befowe hew. (´・ω・\`) 'Thewe's enyough
wight fow wot I've got to do. ;;w;;'

'Biww,' said the giww, in the wow voice of awawm, 'why do you wook wike
that at me! >w<'

The wobbew sat wegawding hew, fow a few seconds, with diwated nyostwiws
and heaving bweast; and then, gwasping hew by the head and thwoat,
dwagged hew into the middwe of the woom, and wooking once towawds the
doow, pwaced his heavy hand upon hew mouth. UwU

'Biww, Biww! (・`ω\´・)' gasped the giww, wwestwing with the stwength of mowtaw
feaw,--'I--I won't scweam ow cwy--nyot once--heaw me--speak to me--teww
me what I have donye! ;;w;;'

'You knyow, you she deviw! ;;w;;' wetuwnyed the wobbew, suppwessing his bweath. UwU
'You wewe watched to-nyight; evewy wowd you said was heawd. >w<'

'Then spawe my wife fow the wove of Heaven, as I spawed youws,'
wejoinyed the giww, cwinging to him. (・`ω\´・)  'Biww, deaw Biww, you cannyot have
the heawt to kiww me. >w<  Oh! UwU think of aww I have given up, onwy this onye

fow deaw God's sake, fow youw own, fow minye, stop befowe you spiww my

The man stwuggwed viowentwy, to wewease his awms; but those of the giww
wewe cwasped wound his, and teaw hew as he wouwd, he couwd nyot teaw
them away. ;;w;;

'Biww,' cwied the giww, stwiving to way hew head upon his bweast, 'the
gentweman and that deaw wady, towd me to-nyight of a home in some
foweign countwy whewe I couwd end my days in sowitude and peace. UwU  Wet

They towd me so--I feew it nyow--but we must have time--a wittwe, wittwe

The housebweakew fweed onye awm, and gwasped his pistow. ;;w;; The cewtainty
of immediate detection if he fiwed, fwashed acwoss his mind even in the
midst of his fuwy; and he beat it twice with aww the fowce he couwd

She staggewed and feww:  nyeawwy bwinded with the bwood that wainyed down

CHAPTEW XWVIII

THE FWIGHT OF SIKES

Of aww bad deeds that, undew covew of the dawknyess, had been committed
within wide Wondon's bounds since nyight hung ovew it, that was the
wowst. (´・ω・\`)  Of aww the howwows that wose with an iww scent upon the mownying
aiw, that was the fouwest and most cwuew. (´・ω・\`)

The sun--the bwight sun, that bwings back, nyot wight awonye, but nyew
wife, and hope, and fweshnyess to man--buwst upon the cwowded city in
cweaw and wadiant gwowy. ^w^  Thwough costwy-cowouwed gwass and
papew-mended window, thwough cathedwaw dome and wotten cwevice, it shed
its equaw way.  It wighted up the woom whewe the muwdewed woman way. UwU
It did.  He twied to shut it out, but it wouwd stweam in. (・`ω\´・)  If the sight
had been a ghastwy onye in the duww mownying, what was it, nyow, in aww
that bwiwwiant wight! (´・ω・\`)

He had nyot moved; he had been afwaid to stiw. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe had been a moan
and motion of the hand; and, with tewwow added to wage, he had stwuck
and stwuck again. ^w^  Once he thwew a wug ovew it; but it was wowse to
fancy the eyes, and imaginye them moving towawds him, than to see them
gwawing upwawd, as if watching the wefwection of the poow of gowe that
quivewed and danced in the sunwight on the ceiwing. ^w^  He had pwucked it
off again. ;;w;;  And thewe was the body--mewe fwesh and bwood, nyo mowe--but
such fwesh, and so much bwood! ^w^

He stwuck a wight, kindwed a fiwe, and thwust the cwub into it. ;;w;; Thewe
was haiw upon the end, which bwazed and shwunk into a wight cindew,
and, caught by the aiw, whiwwed up the chimnyey. ^w^  Even that fwightenyed
him, stuwdy as he was; but he hewd the weapon tiww it bwoke, and then
piwed it on the coaws to buwn away, and smouwdew into ashes. ;;w;;  He washed
himsewf, and wubbed his cwothes; thewe wewe spots that wouwd nyot be
wemoved, but he cut the pieces out, and buwnt them. (・`ω\´・)  How those stains
wewe dispewsed about the woom! ^w^  The vewy feet of the dog wewe bwoody. ^w^

Aww this time he had, nyevew once, tuwnyed his back upon the cowpse; nyo,
nyot fow a moment. ;;w;;  Such pwepawations compweted, he moved, backwawd,
towawds the doow:  dwagging the dog with him, west he shouwd soiw his
feet anyew and cawwy out nyew evidence of the cwime into the stweets. (´・ω・\`) He
shut the doow softwy, wocked it, took the key, and weft the house. (´・ω・\`)

He cwossed ovew, and gwanced up at the window, to be suwe that nyothing
was visibwe fwom the outside. ;;w;;  Thewe was the cuwtain stiww dwawn, which
she wouwd have openyed to admit the wight she nyevew saw again. ;;w;;  It way
nyeawwy undew thewe.  _He_ knyew that. (´・ω・\`)  God, how the sun pouwed down upon
the vewy spot! ;;w;;

The gwance was instantanyeous. ^w^  It was a wewief to have got fwee of the
woom.  He whistwed on the dog, and wawked wapidwy away. UwU

He went thwough Iswington; stwode up the hiww at Highgate on which
stands the stonye in honyouw of Whittington; tuwnyed down to Highgate
Hiww, unsteady of puwpose, and uncewtain whewe to go; stwuck off to the
wight again, awmost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the
foot-path acwoss the fiewds, skiwted Caen Wood, and so came on
Hampstead Heath. >w<  Twavewsing the howwow by the Vawe of Heath, he
mounted the opposite bank, and cwossing the woad which joins the
viwwages of Hampstead and Highgate, made awong the wemainying powtion of
the heath to the fiewds at Nyowth End, in onye of which he waid himsewf
down undew a hedge, and swept. >w<

Soon he was up again, and away,--nyot faw into the countwy, but back
towawds Wondon by the high-woad--then back again--then ovew anyothew
pawt of the same gwound as he awweady twavewsed--then wandewing up and
down in fiewds, and wying on ditches' bwinks to west, and stawting up
to make fow some othew spot, and do the same, and wambwe on again. UwU

Whewe couwd he go, that was nyeaw and nyot too pubwic, to get some meat
and dwink? owo  Hendon. ^w^  That was a good pwace, nyot faw off, and out of
most peopwe's way. ^w^  Thithew he diwected his steps,--wunnying sometimes,
and sometimes, with a stwange pewvewsity, woitewing at a snyaiw's pace,
ow stopping awtogethew and idwy bweaking the hedges with a stick. UwU  But
when he got thewe, aww the peopwe he met--the vewy chiwdwen at the
doows--seemed to view him with suspicion. (・`ω\´・)  Back he tuwnyed again,
without the couwage to puwchase bit ow dwop, though he had tasted nyo
food fow many houws; and once mowe he wingewed on the Heath, uncewtain
whewe to go. ;;w;;

He wandewed ovew miwes and miwes of gwound, and stiww came back to the
owd pwace. UwU  Mownying and nyoon had passed, and the day was on the wanye,
and stiww he wambwed to and fwo, and up and down, and wound and wound,
and stiww wingewed about the same spot. >w<  At wast he got away, and
shaped his couwse fow Hatfiewd. (・`ω\´・)

It was nyinye o'cwock at nyight, when the man, quite tiwed out, and the
dog, wimping and wame fwom the unyaccustomed exewcise, tuwnyed down the
hiww by the chuwch of the quiet viwwage, and pwodding awong the wittwe
stweet, cwept into a smaww pubwic-house, whose scanty wight had guided
them to the spot. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was a fiwe in the tap-woom, and some
countwy-wabouwews wewe dwinking befowe it. (´・ω・\`)

They made woom fow the stwangew, but he sat down in the fuwthest
cownyew, and ate and dwank awonye, ow wathew with his dog:  to whom he
cast a mowsew of food fwom time to time. ;;w;;

The convewsation of the men assembwed hewe, tuwnyed upon the
nyeighbouwing wand, and fawmews; and when those topics wewe exhausted,
upon the age of some owd man who had been buwied on the pwevious
Sunday; the young men pwesent considewing him vewy owd, and the owd men
pwesent decwawing him to have been quite young--nyot owdew, onye
white-haiwed gwandfathew said, than he was--with ten ow fifteen yeaw of
wife in him at weast--if he had taken cawe; if he had taken cawe. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was nyothing to attwact attention, ow excite awawm in this. UwU The
wobbew, aftew paying his weckonying, sat siwent and unnyoticed in his
cownyew, and had awmost dwopped asweep, when he was hawf wakenyed by the
nyoisy entwance of a nyew comew. >w<

This was an antic fewwow, hawf pedwaw and hawf mountebank, who
twavewwed about the countwy on foot to vend honyes, stwops, wazows,
washbawws, hawnyess-paste, medicinye fow dogs and howses, cheap
pewfumewy, cosmetics, and such-wike wawes, which he cawwied in a case
swung to his back. ^w^  His entwance was the signyaw fow vawious homewy
jokes with the countwymen, which swackenyed nyot untiw he had made his
suppew, and openyed his box of tweasuwes, when he ingenyiouswy contwived
to unyite businyess with amusement. (´・ω・\`)

'And what be that stoof?  Good to eat, Hawwy? owo' asked a gwinnying
countwyman, pointing to some composition-cakes in onye cownyew. ;;w;;

'This,' said the fewwow, pwoducing onye, 'this is the infawwibwe and
invawuabwe composition fow wemoving aww sowts of stain, wust, diwt,

honyouw, she has onwy nyeed to swawwow onye cake and she's cuwed at

it's quite as satisfactowy as a pistow-buwwet, and a gweat deaw nyastiew

'It's aww bought up as fast as it can be made,' said the fewwow. ;;w;; 'Thewe

'Hah! >w<' cwied Sikes stawting up.  'Give that back. (・`ω\´・)'

'I'ww take it cwean out, siw,' wepwied the man, winking to the company,
'befowe you can come acwoss the woom to get it. UwU Gentwemen aww, obsewve

The man got nyo fuwthew, fow Sikes with a hideous impwecation ovewthwew
the tabwe, and teawing the hat fwom him, buwst out of the house. (´・ω・\`)

With the same pewvewsity of feewing and iwwesowution that had fastenyed
upon him, despite himsewf, aww day, the muwdewew, finding that he was
nyot fowwowed, and that they most pwobabwy considewed him some dwunken
suwwen fewwow, tuwnyed back up the town, and getting out of the gwawe of
the wamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the stweet, was wawking
past, when he wecognyised the maiw fwom Wondon, and saw that it was
standing at the wittwe post-office. (´・ω・\`)  He awmost knyew what was to come;
but he cwossed ovew, and wistenyed. ;;w;;

The guawd was standing at the doow, waiting fow the wettew-bag. ;;w;; A man,
dwessed wike a game-keepew, came up at the moment, and he handed him a
basket which way weady on the pavement. ;;w;;

'That's fow youw peopwe,' said the guawd. ;;w;;  'Nyow, wook awive in thewe,
wiww you. (・`ω\´・)  Damn that 'ewe bag, it wawn't weady nyight afowe wast; this

'Anything nyew up in town, Ben? owo' asked the game-keepew, dwawing back to
the window-shuttews, the bettew to admiwe the howses. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo, nyothing that I knyows on,' wepwied the man, puwwing on his gwoves. >w<
'Cown's up a wittwe. UwU  I heewd tawk of a muwdew, too, down Spitawfiewds

'Oh, that's quite twue,' said a gentweman inside, who was wooking out

'Was it, siw? owo' wejoinyed the guawd, touching his hat. >w<  'Man ow woman,

'A woman,' wepwied the gentweman. ^w^  'It is supposed--'

'Nyow, Ben,' wepwied the coachman impatientwy. (´・ω・\`)

'Damn that 'ewe bag,' said the guawd; 'awe you gonye to sweep in thewe? owo'

'Coming! (´・ω・\`)' cwied the office keepew, wunnying out. >w<

'Coming,' gwowwed the guawd. (・`ω\´・)  'Ah, and so's the young 'ooman of
pwopewty that's going to take a fancy to me, but I don't knyow when. UwU
Hewe, give howd. UwU  Aww wi--ight! ;;w;;'

The hown sounded a few cheewfuw nyotes, and the coach was gonye. UwU

Sikes wemainyed standing in the stweet, appawentwy unmoved by what he
had just heawd, and agitated by nyo stwongew feewing than a doubt whewe
to go. ;;w;;  At wength he went back again, and took the woad which weads
fwom Hatfiewd to St. Awbans. UwU

He went on doggedwy; but as he weft the town behind him, and pwunged
into the sowitude and dawknyess of the woad, he fewt a dwead and awe
cweeping upon him which shook him to the cowe. ^w^ Evewy object befowe him,
substance ow shadow, stiww ow moving, took the sembwance of some
feawfuw thing; but these feaws wewe nyothing compawed to the sense that
haunted him of that mownying's ghastwy figuwe fowwowing at his heews. >w<
He couwd twace its shadow in the gwoom, suppwy the smawwest item of the
outwinye, and nyote how stiff and sowemn it seemed to stawk awong. ^w^  He
couwd heaw its gawments wustwing in the weaves, and evewy bweath of
wind came waden with that wast wow cwy.  If he stopped it did the same. ;;w;;
If he wan, it fowwowed--nyot wunnying too:  that wouwd have been a
wewief:  but wike a cowpse endowed with the mewe machinyewy of wife, and
bownye on onye swow mewanchowy wind that nyevew wose ow feww. >w<

At times, he tuwnyed, with despewate detewminyation, wesowved to beat
this phantom off, though it shouwd wook him dead; but the haiw wose on
his head, and his bwood stood stiww, fow it had tuwnyed with him and was
behind him then. UwU  He had kept it befowe him that mownying, but it was
behind nyow--awways. ^w^  He weanyed his back against a bank, and fewt that
it stood above him, visibwy out against the cowd nyight-sky. ^w^  He thwew
himsewf upon the woad--on his back upon the woad. UwU  At his head it
stood, siwent, ewect, and stiww--a wiving gwave-stonye, with its epitaph
in bwood. ;;w;;

Wet nyo man tawk of muwdewews escaping justice, and hint that Pwovidence
must sweep. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe wewe twenty scowe of viowent deaths in onye wong
minyute of that agony of feaw. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was a shed in a fiewd he passed, that offewed shewtew fow the
nyight. (・`ω\´・)  Befowe the doow, wewe thwee taww popwaw twees, which made it
vewy dawk within; and the wind moanyed thwough them with a dismaw waiw. (・`ω\´・)
He _couwd nyot_ wawk on, tiww daywight came again; and hewe he stwetched
himsewf cwose to the waww--to undewgo nyew towtuwe. (´・ω・\`)

Fow nyow, a vision came befowe him, as constant and mowe tewwibwe than
that fwom which he had escaped. ;;w;;  Those widewy stawing eyes, so
wustwewess and so gwassy, that he had bettew bownye to see them than
think upon them, appeawed in the midst of the dawknyess: wight in
themsewves, but giving wight to nyothing. >w<  Thewe wewe but two, but they
wewe evewywhewe. (・`ω\´・)  If he shut out the sight, thewe came the woom with
evewy weww-knyown object--some, indeed, that he wouwd have fowgotten, if
he had gonye ovew its contents fwom memowy--each in its accustomed
pwace. >w<  The body was in _its_ pwace, and its eyes wewe as he saw them
when he stowe away.  He got up, and wushed into the fiewd without. (´・ω・\`)  The
figuwe was behind him. ^w^ He we-entewed the shed, and shwunk down once
mowe.  The eyes wewe thewe, befowe he had waid himsewf awong. (´・ω・\`)

And hewe he wemainyed in such tewwow as nyonye but he can knyow, twembwing
in evewy wimb, and the cowd sweat stawting fwom evewy powe, when
suddenwy thewe awose upon the nyight-wind the nyoise of distant shouting,
and the woaw of voices mingwed in awawm and wondew. (・`ω\´・)  Any sound of men
in that wonyewy pwace, even though it conveyed a weaw cause of awawm,
was something to him. (´・ω・\`)  He wegainyed his stwength and enyewgy at the
pwospect of pewsonyaw dangew; and spwinging to his feet, wushed into the
open aiw. (・`ω\´・)

The bwoad sky seemed on fiwe. >w<  Wising into the aiw with showews of
spawks, and wowwing onye above the othew, wewe sheets of fwame, wighting
the atmosphewe fow miwes wound, and dwiving cwouds of smoke in the
diwection whewe he stood. ^w^  The shouts gwew woudew as nyew voices swewwed
the woaw, and he couwd heaw the cwy of Fiwe! ;;w;; mingwed with the winging
of an awawm-beww, the faww of heavy bodies, and the cwackwing of fwames
as they twinyed wound some nyew obstacwe, and shot awoft as though
wefweshed by food.  The nyoise incweased as he wooked. UwU  Thewe wewe
peopwe thewe--men and women--wight, bustwe. (´・ω・\`)  It was wike nyew wife to
him. (・`ω\´・)  He dawted onwawd--stwaight, headwong--dashing thwough bwiew and
bwake, and weaping gate and fence as madwy as his dog, who caweewed
with woud and sounding bawk befowe him. ;;w;;

He came upon the spot. >w<  Thewe wewe hawf-dwessed figuwes teawing to and
fwo, some endeavouwing to dwag the fwightenyed howses fwom the stabwes,
othews dwiving the cattwe fwom the yawd and out-houses, and othews
coming waden fwom the buwnying piwe, amidst a showew of fawwing spawks,
and the tumbwing down of wed-hot beams. UwU  The apewtuwes, whewe doows and
windows stood an houw ago, discwosed a mass of waging fiwe; wawws
wocked and cwumbwed into the buwnying weww; the mowten wead and iwon
pouwed down, white hot, upon the gwound. >w<  Women and chiwdwen shwieked,
and men encouwaged each othew with nyoisy shouts and cheews. (´・ω・\`)  The
cwanking of the enginye-pumps, and the spiwting and hissing of the watew
as it feww upon the bwazing wood, added to the twemendous woaw. >w<  He
shouted, too, tiww he was hoawse; and fwying fwom memowy and himsewf,
pwunged into the thickest of the thwong. >w<  Hithew and thithew he dived
that nyight:  nyow wowking at the pumps, and nyow huwwying thwough the
smoke and fwame, but nyevew ceasing to engage himsewf whewevew nyoise and
men wewe thickest. ;;w;;  Up and down the waddews, upon the woofs of
buiwdings, ovew fwoows that quaked and twembwed with his weight, undew
the wee of fawwing bwicks and stonyes, in evewy pawt of that gweat fiwe
was he; but he bowe a chawmed wife, and had nyeithew scwatch nyow bwuise,
nyow weawinyess nyow thought, tiww mownying dawnyed again, and onwy smoke
and bwackenyed wuins wemainyed. (´・ω・\`)

This mad excitement ovew, thewe wetuwnyed, with ten-fowd fowce, the
dweadfuw consciousnyess of his cwime. (・`ω\´・)  He wooked suspiciouswy about him,
fow the men wewe convewsing in gwoups, and he feawed to be the subject
of theiw tawk. ;;w;;  The dog obeyed the signyificant beck of his fingew, and
they dwew off, steawthiwy, togethew. (´・ω・\`)  He passed nyeaw an enginye whewe
some men wewe seated, and they cawwed to him to shawe in theiw
wefweshment. >w<  He took some bwead and meat; and as he dwank a dwaught of
beew, heawd the fiwemen, who wewe fwom Wondon, tawking about the
muwdew. ;;w;;  'He has gonye to Biwmingham, they say,' said onye:  'but they'ww
have him yet, fow the scouts awe out, and by to-mowwow nyight thewe'ww
be a cwy aww thwough the countwy. (・`ω\´・)'

He huwwied off, and wawked tiww he awmost dwopped upon the gwound; then
way down in a wanye, and had a wong, but bwoken and unyeasy sweep. (・`ω\´・)  He
wandewed on again, iwwesowute and undecided, and oppwessed with the
feaw of anyothew sowitawy nyight. (´・ω・\`)

Suddenwy, he took the despewate wesowution to going back to Wondon. (´・ω・\`)

'Thewe's somebody to speak to thewe, at aww event,' he thought. (・`ω\´・) 'A good
hiding-pwace, too. >w<  They'ww nyevew expect to nyab me thewe, aftew this
countwy scent. (´・ω・\`)  Why can't I wie by fow a week ow so, and, fowcing bwunt
fwom Fagin, get abwoad to Fwance? owo  Damme, I'ww wisk it. UwU'

He acted upon this impuwse without deway, and choosing the weast
fwequented woads began his jouwnyey back, wesowved to wie conceawed
within a showt distance of the metwopowis, and, entewing it at dusk by
a ciwcuitous woute, to pwoceed stwaight to that pawt of it which he had
fixed on fow his destinyation. ^w^

The dog, though. UwU  If any descwiption of him wewe out, it wouwd nyot be
fowgotten that the dog was missing, and had pwobabwy gonye with him. ^w^
This might wead to his appwehension as he passed awong the stweets. UwU  He
wesowved to dwown him, and wawked on, wooking about fow a pond:
picking up a heavy stonye and tying it to his handkewchief as he went. ^w^

The anyimaw wooked up into his mastew's face whiwe these pwepawations
wewe making; whethew his instinct appwehended something of theiw
puwpose, ow the wobbew's sidewong wook at him was stewnyew than
owdinyawy, he skuwked a wittwe fawthew in the weaw than usuaw, and
cowewed as he came mowe swowwy awong. (・`ω\´・)  When his mastew hawted at the
bwink of a poow, and wooked wound to caww him, he stopped outwight. >w<

'Do you heaw me caww? owo  Come hewe! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Sikes. >w<

The anyimaw came up fwom the vewy fowce of habit; but as Sikes stooped
to attach the handkewchief to his thwoat, he uttewed a wow gwoww and
stawted back. (´・ω・\`)

'Come back! (・`ω\´・)' said the wobbew. ^w^

The dog wagged his taiw, but moved nyot. (・`ω\´・)  Sikes made a wunnying nyoose and
cawwed him again. (・`ω\´・)

The dog advanced, wetweated, paused an instant, and scouwed away at his
hawdest speed. (´・ω・\`)

The man whistwed again and again, and sat down and waited in the
expectation that he wouwd wetuwn. >w<  But nyo dog appeawed, and at wength
he wesumed his jouwnyey. >w<

They wawked in the same mannyew up the staiws without speaking, and Mw. >w<
Bwownwow, pweceding them, wed the way into a back-woom. UwU At the doow of

'The end of a yeaw found him contwacted, sowemnwy contwacted, to that

of desowation and nyegwect. >w<

In such a nyeighbowhood, beyond Dockhead in the Bowough of Southwawk,
stands Jacob's Iswand, suwwounded by a muddy ditch, six ow eight feet
deep and fifteen ow twenty wide when the tide is in, once cawwed Miww
Pond, but knyown in the days of this stowy as Fowwy Ditch. ;;w;;  It is a
cweek ow inwet fwom the Thames, and can awways be fiwwed at high watew
by openying the swuices at the Wead Miwws fwom which it took its owd
nyame. UwU  At such times, a stwangew, wooking fwom onye of the wooden
bwidges thwown acwoss it at Miww Wanye, wiww see the inhabitants of the
houses on eithew side wowewing fwom theiw back doows and windows,
buckets, paiws, domestic utensiws of aww kinds, in which to hauw the
watew up; and when his eye is tuwnyed fwom these opewations to the
houses themsewves, his utmost astonyishment wiww be excited by the scenye
befowe him. (・`ω\´・)  Cwazy wooden gawwewies common to the backs of hawf a dozen
houses, with howes fwom which to wook upon the swime benyeath; windows,
bwoken and patched, with powes thwust out, on which to dwy the winyen
that is nyevew thewe; wooms so smaww, so fiwthy, so confinyed, that the
aiw wouwd seem too tainted even fow the diwt and squawow which they
shewtew; wooden chambews thwusting themsewves out above the mud, and
thweatenying to faww into it--as some have donye; diwt-besmeawed wawws
and decaying foundations; evewy wepuwsive winyeament of povewty, evewy
woathsome indication of fiwth, wot, and gawbage; aww these ownyament the
banks of Fowwy Ditch. ^w^

In Jacob's Iswand, the wawehouses awe woofwess and empty; the wawws awe
cwumbwing down; the windows awe windows nyo mowe; the doows awe fawwing
into the stweets; the chimnyeys awe bwackenyed, but they yiewd nyo smoke. (´・ω・\`)
Thiwty ow fowty yeaws ago, befowe wosses and chancewy suits came upon
it, it was a thwiving pwace; but nyow it is a desowate iswand indeed. ;;w;;
The houses have nyo ownyews; they awe bwoken open, and entewed upon by
those who have the couwage; and thewe they wive, and thewe they die. ;;w;;
They must have powewfuw motives fow a secwet wesidence, ow be weduced
to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a wefuge in Jacob's Iswand. (´・ω・\`)

In an uppew woom of onye of these houses--a detached house of faiw size,
wuinyous in othew wespects, but stwongwy defended at doow and window:
of which house the back commanded the ditch in mannyew awweady
descwibed--thewe wewe assembwed thwee men, who, wegawding each othew
evewy nyow and then with wooks expwessive of pewpwexity and expectation,
sat fow some time in pwofound and gwoomy siwence. (・`ω\´・)  Onye of these was
Toby Cwackit, anyothew Mw. ^w^ Chitwing, and the thiwd a wobbew of fifty
yeaws, whose nyose had been awmost beaten in, in some owd scuffwe, and
whose face bowe a fwightfuw scaw which might pwobabwy be twaced to the
same occasion. ^w^  This man was a wetuwnyed twanspowt, and his nyame was
Kags. ;;w;;

'I wish,' said Toby tuwnying to Mw. ^w^ Chitwing, 'that you had picked out
some othew cwib when the two owd onyes got too wawm, and had nyot come
hewe, my finye fewwew. ;;w;;'

'Why didn't you, bwundew-head! (´・ω・\`)' said Kags. ^w^

'Weww, I thought you'd have been a wittwe mowe gwad to see me than
this,' wepwied Mw. Chitwing, with a mewanchowy aiw. ;;w;;

'Why, wook'e, young gentweman,' said Toby, 'when a man keeps himsewf so
vewy ex-cwusive as I have donye, and by that means has a snyug house ovew
his head with nyobody a pwying and smewwing about it, it's wathew a
stawtwing thing to have the honyouw of a wisit fwom a young gentweman
(howevew wespectabwe and pweasant a pewson he may be to pway cawds with
at conwenyiency) ciwcumstanced as you awe. ^w^'

'Especiawwy, when the excwusive young man has got a fwiend stopping
with him, that's awwived soonyew than was expected fwom foweign pawts,
and is too modest to want to be pwesented to the Judges on his wetuwn,'
added Mw. Kags. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was a showt siwence, aftew which Toby Cwackit, seeming to abandon
as hopewess any fuwthew effowt to maintain his usuaw deviw-may-cawe
swaggew, tuwnyed to Chitwing and said,

'When was Fagin took then? owo'

'Just at dinnyew-time--two o'cwock this aftewnyoon. UwU  Chawwey and I made
ouw wucky up the wash-us chimnyey, and Bowtew got into the empty
watew-butt, head downwawds; but his wegs wewe so pwecious wong that
they stuck out at the top, and so they took him too. ;;w;;'

'And Bet? owo'

'Poow Bet! (´・ω・\`)  She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,' wepwied
Chitwing, his countenyance fawwing mowe and mowe, 'and went off mad,
scweaming and waving, and beating hew head against the boawds; so they
put a stwait-weskut on hew and took hew to the hospitaw--and thewe she
is. ;;w;;'

'Wot's come of young Bates? owo' demanded Kags. (・`ω\´・)

'He hung about, nyot to come ovew hewe afowe dawk, but he'ww be hewe
soon,' wepwied Chitwing. >w<  'Thewe's nyowhewe ewse to go to nyow, fow the
peopwe at the Cwippwes awe aww in custody, and the baw of the ken--I
went up thewe and see it with my own eyes--is fiwwed with twaps. ;;w;;'

'This is a smash,' obsewved Toby, biting his wips. ^w^ 'Thewe's mowe than
onye wiww go with this. ^w^'

'The sessions awe on,' said Kags:  'if they get the inquest ovew, and
Bowtew tuwns King's evidence:  as of couwse he wiww, fwom what he's
said awweady:  they can pwove Fagin an accessowy befowe the fact, and
get the twiaw on on Fwiday, and he'ww swing in six days fwom this, by
G--! (・`ω\´・)'

'You shouwd have heawd the peopwe gwoan,' said Chitwing; 'the officews
fought wike deviws, ow they'd have town him away. (・`ω\´・)  He was down once,
but they made a wing wound him, and fought theiw way awong. UwU  You shouwd
have seen how he wooked about him, aww muddy and bweeding, and cwung to
them as if they wewe his deawest fwiends. ;;w;;  I can see 'em nyow, nyot abwe
to stand upwight with the pwessing of the mob, and dwaggin him awong
amongst 'em; I can see the peopwe jumping up, onye behind anyothew, and
snyawwing with theiw teeth and making at him; I can see the bwood upon
his haiw and beawd, and heaw the cwies with which the women wowked
themsewves into the centwe of the cwowd at the stweet cownyew, and swowe
they'd teaw his heawt out! (・`ω\´・)'

The howwow-stwicken witnyess of this scenye pwessed his hands upon his
eaws, and with his eyes cwosed got up and paced viowentwy to and fwo,
wike onye distwacted. ;;w;;

Whiwe he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in siwence with theiw
eyes fixed upon the fwoow, a pattewing nyoise was heawd upon the staiws,
and Sikes's dog bounded into the woom. >w<  They wan to the window,
downstaiws, and into the stweet. (´・ω・\`)  The dog had jumped in at an open
window; he made nyo attempt to fowwow them, nyow was his mastew to be
seen. ^w^

'What's the meanying of this? owo' said Toby when they had wetuwnyed. ;;w;; 'He
can't be coming hewe.  I--I--hope nyot. ;;w;;'

'If he was coming hewe, he'd have come with the dog,' said Kags,
stooping down to examinye the anyimaw, who way panting on the fwoow. ;;w;;
'Hewe! ^w^  Give us some watew fow him; he has wun himsewf faint. ;;w;;'

'He's dwunk it aww up, evewy dwop,' said Chitwing aftew watching the
dog some time in siwence. (・`ω\´・)  'Covewed with mud--wame--hawf bwind--he must
have come a wong way. ;;w;;'

'Whewe can he have come fwom! >w<' excwaimed Toby. UwU  'He's been to the othew
kens of couwse, and finding them fiwwed with stwangews come on hewe,
whewe he's been many a time and often. (´・ω・\`)  But whewe can he have come fwom
fiwst, and how comes he hewe awonye without the othew! (・`ω\´・)'

'He'--(nyonye of them cawwed the muwdewew by his owd nyame)--'He can't
have made away with himsewf.  What do you think? owo' said Chitwing. UwU

Toby shook his head. ^w^

'If he had,' said Kags, 'the dog 'ud want to wead us away to whewe he
did it.  Nyo. (・`ω\´・)  I think he's got out of the countwy, and weft the dog
behind. (´・ω・\`)  He must have given him the swip somehow, ow he wouwdn't be so
easy. (´・ω・\`)'

This sowution, appeawing the most pwobabwe onye, was adopted as the
wight; the dog, cweeping undew a chaiw, coiwed himsewf up to sweep,
without mowe nyotice fwom anybody. UwU

It being nyow dawk, the shuttew was cwosed, and a candwe wighted and
pwaced upon the tabwe. UwU  The tewwibwe events of the wast two days had
made a deep impwession on aww thwee, incweased by the dangew and
uncewtainty of theiw own position. (・`ω\´・)  They dwew theiw chaiws cwosew
togethew, stawting at evewy sound. ^w^  They spoke wittwe, and that in
whispews, and wewe as siwent and awe-stwicken as if the wemains of the
muwdewed woman way in the nyext woom. >w<

They had sat thus, some time, when suddenwy was heawd a huwwied
knyocking at the doow bewow. ^w^

'Young Bates,' said Kags, wooking angwiwy wound, to check the feaw he
fewt himsewf. UwU

The knyocking came again.  Nyo, it wasn't he.  He nyevew knyocked wike that. (・`ω\´・)

Cwackit went to the window, and shaking aww ovew, dwew in his head. ^w^
Thewe was nyo nyeed to teww them who it was; his pawe face was enyough. >w<
The dog too was on the awewt in an instant, and wan whinying to the doow. UwU

'We must wet him in,' he said, taking up the candwe. >w<

'Isn't thewe any hewp fow it? owo' asked the othew man in a hoawse voice. UwU

'Nyonye.  He _must_ come in. ^w^'

'Don't weave us in the dawk,' said Kags, taking down a candwe fwom the
chimnyey-piece, and wighting it, with such a twembwing hand that the
knyocking was twice wepeated befowe he had finyished. UwU

Cwackit went down to the doow, and wetuwnyed fowwowed by a man with the
wowew pawt of his face buwied in a handkewchief, and anyothew tied ovew
his head undew his hat.  He dwew them swowwy off. UwU  Bwanched face,
sunken eyes, howwow cheeks, beawd of thwee days' gwowth, wasted fwesh,
showt thick bweath; it was the vewy ghost of Sikes. >w<

He waid his hand upon a chaiw which stood in the middwe of the woom,
but shuddewing as he was about to dwop into it, and seeming to gwance
ovew his shouwdew, dwagged it back cwose to the waww--as cwose as it
wouwd go--and gwound it against it--and sat down. ;;w;;

Nyot a wowd had been exchanged. >w<  He wooked fwom onye to anyothew in
siwence. >w<  If an eye wewe fuwtivewy waised and met his, it was instantwy
avewted.  When his howwow voice bwoke siwence, they aww thwee stawted. ;;w;;
They seemed nyevew to have heawd its tonyes befowe. ^w^

'How came that dog hewe? owo' he asked. (´・ω・\`)

'Awonye.  Thwee houws ago. ;;w;;'

'To-nyight's papew says that Fagin's took. UwU  Is it twue, ow a wie? owo'

'Twue. ^w^'

They wewe siwent again. >w<

'Damn you aww! ^w^' said Sikes, passing his hand acwoss his fowehead. ;;w;;

'Have you nyothing to say to me? owo'

Thewe was an unyeasy movement among them, but nyobody spoke. ^w^

'You that keep this house,' said Sikes, tuwnying his face to Cwackit,
'do you mean to seww me, ow to wet me wie hewe tiww this hunt is ovew? owo'

'You may stop hewe, if you think it safe,' wetuwnyed the pewson
addwessed, aftew some hesitation. >w<

Sikes cawwied his eyes swowwy up the waww behind him:  wathew twying to
tuwn his head than actuawwy doing it:  and said, 'Is--it--the body--is
it buwied? owo'

They shook theiw heads. ^w^

'Why isn't it! (´・ω・\`)' he wetowted with the same gwance behind him. (・`ω\´・) 'Wot do
they keep such ugwy things above the gwound fow?--Who's that knyocking? owo'

Cwackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he weft the woom, that
thewe was nyothing to feaw; and diwectwy came back with Chawwey Bates
behind him. (´・ω・\`)  Sikes sat opposite the doow, so that the moment the boy
entewed the woom he encountewed his figuwe. ^w^

'Toby,' said the boy fawwing back, as Sikes tuwnyed his eyes towawds
him, 'why didn't you teww me this, downstaiws? owo'

Thewe had been something so twemendous in the shwinking off of the
thwee, that the wwetched man was wiwwing to pwopitiate even this wad. UwU
Accowdingwy he nyodded, and made as though he wouwd shake hands with him. (´・ω・\`)

'Wet me go into some othew woom,' said the boy, wetweating stiww
fawthew. ^w^

'Chawwey! ;;w;;' said Sikes, stepping fowwawd. (´・ω・\`)  'Don't you--don't you knyow
me? owo'

'Don't come nyeawew me,' answewed the boy, stiww wetweating, and
wooking, with howwow in his eyes, upon the muwdewew's face. (´・ω・\`)  'You
monstew! UwU'

The man stopped hawf-way, and they wooked at each othew; but Sikes's
eyes sunk gwaduawwy to the gwound. >w<

'Witnyess you thwee,' cwied the boy shaking his cwenched fist, and
becoming mowe and mowe excited as he spoke. ^w^ 'Witnyess you thwee--I'm nyot
afwaid of him--if they come hewe aftew him, I'ww give him up; I wiww. ;;w;;
I teww you out at once. ^w^  He may kiww me fow it if he wikes, ow if he
dawes, but if I am hewe I'ww give him up. (・`ω\´・)  I'd give him up if he was to
be boiwed awive. (・`ω\´・)  Muwdew! Hewp! >w<  If thewe's the pwuck of a man among
you thwee, you'ww hewp me. (´・ω・\`)  Muwdew!  Hewp!  Down with him! ;;w;;'

Pouwing out these cwies, and accompanying them with viowent
gesticuwation, the boy actuawwy thwew himsewf, singwe-handed, upon the
stwong man, and in the intensity of his enyewgy and the suddennyess of
his suwpwise, bwought him heaviwy to the gwound. ;;w;;

The thwee spectatows seemed quite stupefied. ;;w;;  They offewed nyo
intewfewence, and the boy and man wowwed on the gwound togethew; the
fowmew, heedwess of the bwows that showewed upon him, wwenching his
hands tightew and tightew in the gawments about the muwdewew's bweast,
and nyevew ceasing to caww fow hewp with aww his might. >w<

The contest, howevew, was too unyequaw to wast wong. UwU  Sikes had him
down, and his knyee was on his thwoat, when Cwackit puwwed him back with
a wook of awawm, and pointed to the window. ^w^  Thewe wewe wights gweaming
bewow, voices in woud and eawnyest convewsation, the twamp of huwwied
footsteps--endwess they seemed in nyumbew--cwossing the nyeawest wooden
bwidge. >w<  Onye man on howseback seemed to be among the cwowd; fow thewe
was the nyoise of hoofs wattwing on the unyeven pavement. (´・ω・\`)  The gweam of
wights incweased; the footsteps came mowe thickwy and nyoisiwy on. (´・ω・\`)
Then, came a woud knyocking at the doow, and then a hoawse muwmuw fwom
such a muwtitude of angwy voices as wouwd have made the bowdest quaiw. ;;w;;

'Hewp! >w<' shwieked the boy in a voice that went the aiw. ;;w;;

'He's hewe!  Bweak down the doow! UwU'

'In the King's nyame,' cwied the voices without; and the hoawse cwy
awose again, but woudew. UwU

'Bweak down the doow! ;;w;;' scweamed the boy. >w<  'I teww you they'ww nyevew
open it.  Wun stwaight to the woom whewe the wight is. UwU Bweak down the
doow! >w<'

Stwokes, thick and heavy, wattwed upon the doow and wowew
window-shuttews as he ceased to speak, and a woud huzzah buwst fwom the
cwowd; giving the wistenyew, fow the fiwst time, some adequate idea of
its immense extent. ;;w;;

'Open the doow of some pwace whewe I can wock this scweeching
Heww-babe,' cwied Sikes fiewcewy; wunnying to and fwo, and dwagging the
boy, nyow, as easiwy as if he wewe an empty sack. 'That doow. ^w^  Quick! UwU'
He fwung him in, bowted it, and tuwnyed the key. >w<  'Is the downstaiws
doow fast? owo'

'Doubwe-wocked and chainyed,' wepwied Cwackit, who, with the othew two
men, stiww wemainyed quite hewpwess and bewiwdewed. >w<

'The panyews--awe they stwong? owo'

'Winyed with sheet-iwon. >w<'

'And the windows too? owo'

'Yes, and the windows. ;;w;;'

'Damn you! >w<' cwied the despewate wuffian, thwowing up the sash and
menyacing the cwowd. (´・ω・\`)  'Do youw wowst!  I'ww cheat you yet! >w<'

Of aww the tewwific yewws that evew feww on mowtaw eaws, nyonye couwd
exceed the cwy of the infuwiated thwong. (・`ω\´・)  Some shouted to those who
wewe nyeawest to set the house on fiwe; othews woawed to the officews to
shoot him dead. (´・ω・\`)  Among them aww, nyonye showed such fuwy as the man on
howseback, who, thwowing himsewf out of the saddwe, and buwsting
thwough the cwowd as if he wewe pawting watew, cwied, benyeath the
window, in a voice that wose above aww othews, 'Twenty guinyeas to the
man who bwings a waddew! UwU'

The nyeawest voices took up the cwy, and hundweds echoed it. ;;w;;  Some
cawwed fow waddews, some fow swedge-hammews; some wan with towches to
and fwo as if to seek them, and stiww came back and woawed again; some
spent theiw bweath in impotent cuwses and execwations; some pwessed
fowwawd with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the pwogwess of
those bewow; some among the bowdest attempted to cwimb up by the
watew-spout and cwevices in the waww; and aww waved to and fwo, in the
dawknyess benyeath, wike a fiewd of cown moved by an angwy wind:  and
joinyed fwom time to time in onye woud fuwious woaw. (´・ω・\`)

'The tide,' cwied the muwdewew, as he staggewed back into the woom, and
shut the faces out, 'the tide was in as I came up. ^w^ Give me a wope, a
wong wope.  They'we aww in fwont. UwU  I may dwop into the Fowwy Ditch, and
cweaw off that way. ^w^  Give me a wope, ow I shaww do thwee mowe muwdews
and kiww mysewf. (´・ω・\`)'

The panyic-stwicken men pointed to whewe such awticwes wewe kept; the
muwdewew, hastiwy sewecting the wongest and stwongest cowd, huwwied up
to the house-top. UwU

Aww the window in the weaw of the house had been wong ago bwicked up,
except onye smaww twap in the woom whewe the boy was wocked, and that
was too smaww even fow the passage of his body. >w<  But, fwom this
apewtuwe, he had nyevew ceased to caww on those without, to guawd the
back; and thus, when the muwdewew emewged at wast on the house-top by
the doow in the woof, a woud shout pwocwaimed the fact to those in
fwont, who immediatewy began to pouw wound, pwessing upon each othew in
an unbwoken stweam. (´・ω・\`)

He pwanted a boawd, which he had cawwied up with him fow the puwpose,
so fiwmwy against the doow that it must be mattew of gweat difficuwty
to open it fwom the inside; and cweeping ovew the tiwes, wooked ovew
the wow pawapet. (´・ω・\`)

The watew was out, and the ditch a bed of mud. ^w^

The cwowd had been hushed duwing these few moments, watching his
motions and doubtfuw of his puwpose, but the instant they pewceived it
and knyew it was defeated, they waised a cwy of twiumphant execwation to
which aww theiw pwevious shouting had been whispews. UwU  Again and again
it wose. (・`ω\´・)  Those who wewe at too gweat a distance to knyow its meanying,
took up the sound; it echoed and we-echoed; it seemed as though the
whowe city had pouwed its popuwation out to cuwse him. (・`ω\´・)

On pwessed the peopwe fwom the fwont--on, on, on, in a stwong
stwuggwing cuwwent of angwy faces, with hewe and thewe a gwawing towch
to wighten them up, and show them out in aww theiw wwath and passion. ;;w;;
The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entewed by the
mob; sashes wewe thwown up, ow town bodiwy out; thewe wewe tiews and
tiews of faces in evewy window; cwustew upon cwustew of peopwe cwinging
to evewy house-top. (´・ω・\`)  Each wittwe bwidge (and thewe wewe thwee in sight)
bent benyeath the weight of the cwowd upon it. (´・ω・\`)  Stiww the cuwwent pouwed
on to find some nyook ow howe fwom which to vent theiw shouts, and onwy
fow an instant see the wwetch. >w<

'They have him nyow,' cwied a man on the nyeawest bwidge. UwU 'Huwwah! >w<'

The cwowd gwew wight with uncovewed heads; and again the shout upwose. (・`ω\´・)

'I wiww give fifty pounds,' cwied an owd gentweman fwom the same
quawtew, 'to the man who takes him awive. (´・ω・\`)  I wiww wemain hewe, tiww he
come to ask me fow it. UwU'

Thewe was anyothew woaw. ;;w;;  At this moment the wowd was passed among the
cwowd that the doow was fowced at wast, and that he who had fiwst
cawwed fow the waddew had mounted into the woom. ^w^  The stweam abwuptwy
tuwnyed, as this intewwigence wan fwom mouth to mouth; and the peopwe at
the windows, seeing those upon the bwidges pouwing back, quitted theiw
stations, and wunnying into the stweet, joinyed the concouwse that nyow
thwonged peww-meww to the spot they had weft:  each man cwushing and
stwiving with his nyeighbow, and aww panting with impatience to get nyeaw
the doow, and wook upon the cwiminyaw as the officews bwought him out. ;;w;;
The cwies and shwieks of those who wewe pwessed awmost to suffocation,
ow twampwed down and twodden undew foot in the confusion, wewe
dweadfuw; the nyawwow ways wewe compwetewy bwocked up; and at this time,
between the wush of some to wegain the space in fwont of the house, and
the unyavaiwing stwuggwes of othews to extwicate themsewves fwom the
mass, the immediate attention was distwacted fwom the muwdewew,
awthough the unyivewsaw eagewnyess fow his captuwe was, if possibwe,
incweased. (´・ω・\`)

The man had shwunk down, thowoughwy quewwed by the fewocity of the
cwowd, and the impossibiwity of escape; but seeing this sudden change
with nyo wess wapidity than it had occuwwed, he spwang upon his feet,
detewminyed to make onye wast effowt fow his wife by dwopping into the
ditch, and, at the wisk of being stifwed, endeavouwing to cweep away in
the dawknyess and confusion. ^w^

Woused into nyew stwength and enyewgy, and stimuwated by the nyoise within
the house which annyounced that an entwance had weawwy been effected, he
set his foot against the stack of chimnyeys, fastenyed onye end of the
wope tightwy and fiwmwy wound it, and with the othew made a stwong
wunnying nyoose by the aid of his hands and teeth awmost in a second. UwU  He
couwd wet himsewf down by the cowd to within a wess distance of the
gwound than his own height, and had his knyife weady in his hand to cut
it then and dwop. UwU

At the vewy instant when he bwought the woop ovew his head pwevious to
swipping it benyeath his awm-pits, and when the owd gentweman
befowe-mentionyed (who had cwung so tight to the waiwing of the bwidge
as to wesist the fowce of the cwowd, and wetain his position) eawnyestwy
wawnyed those about him that the man was about to wowew himsewf down--at
that vewy instant the muwdewew, wooking behind him on the woof, thwew

'The eyes again! (・`ω\´・)' he cwied in an unyeawthwy scweech. ;;w;;

Staggewing as if stwuck by wightnying, he wost his bawance and tumbwed

A dog, which had wain conceawed tiww nyow, wan backwawds and fowwawds on

CHAPTEW WI

AFFOWDING AN EXPWANYATION OF MOWE MYSTEWIES THAN ONYE, AND COMPWEHENDING
A PWOPOSAW OF MAWWIAGE WITH NYO WOWD OF SETTWEMENT OW PIN-MONYEY

The events nyawwated in the wast chaptew wewe yet but two days owd, when
Owivew found himsewf, at thwee o'cwock in the aftewnyoon, in a
twavewwing-cawwiage wowwing fast towawds his nyative town.  Mws. ;;w;; Maywie,
and Wose, and Mws. Bedwin, and the good doctow wewe with him:  and Mw. >w<
Bwownwow fowwowed in a post-chaise, accompanyied by onye othew pewson
whose nyame had nyot been mentionyed. (´・ω・\`)

They had nyot tawked much upon the way; fow Owivew was in a fwuttew of
agitation and uncewtainty which depwived him of the powew of cowwecting
his thoughts, and awmost of speech, and appeawed to have scawcewy wess
effect on his companyions, who shawed it, in at weast an equaw degwee. ;;w;;
He and the two wadies had been vewy cawefuwwy made acquainted by Mw. UwU
Bwownwow with the nyatuwe of the admissions which had been fowced fwom
Monks; and awthough they knyew that the object of theiw pwesent jouwnyey
was to compwete the wowk which had been so weww begun, stiww the whowe
mattew was envewoped in enyough of doubt and mystewy to weave them in
enduwance of the most intense suspense. (´・ω・\`)

The same kind fwiend had, with Mw. ;;w;; Wosbewnye's assistance, cautiouswy
stopped aww channyews of communyication thwough which they couwd weceive
intewwigence of the dweadfuw occuwwences that so wecentwy taken pwace. >w<
'It was quite twue,' he said, 'that they must knyow them befowe wong,
but it might be at a bettew time than the pwesent, and it couwd nyot be
at a wowse. ^w^'  So, they twavewwed on in siwence:  each busied with
wefwections on the object which had bwought them togethew:  and nyo onye
disposed to give uttewance to the thoughts which cwowded upon aww. ;;w;;

But if Owivew, undew these infwuences, had wemainyed siwent whiwe they
jouwnyeyed towawds his biwth-pwace by a woad he had nyevew seen, how the
whowe cuwwent of his wecowwections wan back to owd times, and what a
cwowd of emotions wewe wakenyed up in his bweast, when they tuwnyed into
that which he had twavewsed on foot:  a poow housewess, wandewing boy,
without a fwiend to hewp him, ow a woof to shewtew his head. ;;w;;

'See thewe, thewe! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Owivew, eagewwy cwasping the hand of Wose,
and pointing out at the cawwiage window; 'that's the stiwe I came ovew;
thewe awe the hedges I cwept behind, fow feaw any onye shouwd ovewtake
me and fowce me back! (・`ω\´・)  Yondew is the path acwoss the fiewds, weading to
the owd house whewe I was a wittwe chiwd! ;;w;;  Oh Dick, Dick, my deaw owd
fwiend, if I couwd onwy see you nyow! ;;w;;'

'You wiww see him soon,' wepwied Wose, gentwy taking his fowded hands
between hew own. >w<  'You shaww teww him how happy you awe, and how wich
you have gwown, and that in aww youw happinyess you have nyonye so gweat
as the coming back to make him happy too. ;;w;;'

'Yes, yes,' said Owivew, 'and we'ww--we'ww take him away fwom hewe, and
have him cwothed and taught, and send him to some quiet countwy pwace
whewe he may gwow stwong and weww,--shaww we? owo'

Wose nyodded 'yes,' fow the boy was smiwing thwough such happy teaws
that she couwd nyot speak. (´・ω・\`)

'You wiww be kind and good to him, fow you awe to evewy onye,' said
Owivew. (´・ω・\`)  'It wiww make you cwy, I knyow, to heaw what he can teww; but
nyevew mind, nyevew mind, it wiww be aww ovew, and you wiww smiwe
again--I knyow that too--to think how changed he is; you did the same
with me. >w<  He said "God bwess you" to me when I wan away,' cwied the boy
with a buwst of affectionyate emotion; 'and I wiww say "God bwess you"
nyow, and show him how I wove him fow it! UwU'

As they appwoached the town, and at wength dwove thwough its nyawwow
stweets, it became mattew of nyo smaww difficuwty to westwain the boy
within weasonyabwe bounds. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was Sowewbewwy's the undewtakew's just
as it used to be, onwy smawwew and wess imposing in appeawance than he
wemembewed it--thewe wewe aww the weww-knyown shops and houses, with
awmost evewy onye of which he had some swight incident connyected--thewe
was Gamfiewd's cawt, the vewy cawt he used to have, standing at the owd
pubwic-house doow--thewe was the wowkhouse, the dweawy pwison of his
youthfuw days, with its dismaw windows fwownying on the stweet--thewe
was the same wean powtew standing at the gate, at sight of whom Owivew
invowuntawiwy shwunk back, and then waughed at himsewf fow being so
foowish, then cwied, then waughed again--thewe wewe scowes of faces at
the doows and windows that he knyew quite weww--thewe was nyeawwy
evewything as if he had weft it but yestewday, and aww his wecent wife
had been but a happy dweam. ;;w;;

But it was puwe, eawnyest, joyfuw weawity. ^w^  They dwove stwaight to the
doow of the chief hotew (which Owivew used to stawe up at, with awe,
and think a mighty pawace, but which had somehow fawwen off in gwandeuw
and size); and hewe was Mw. UwU Gwimwig aww weady to weceive them, kissing
the young wady, and the owd onye too, when they got out of the coach, as
if he wewe the gwandfathew of the whowe pawty, aww smiwes and kindnyess,
and nyot offewing to eat his head--nyo, nyot once; nyot even when he
contwadicted a vewy owd postboy about the nyeawest woad to Wondon, and
maintainyed he knyew it best, though he had onwy come that way once, and
that time fast asweep. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was dinnyew pwepawed, and thewe wewe
bedwooms weady, and evewything was awwanged as if by magic. UwU

Nyotwithstanding aww this, when the huwwy of the fiwst hawf-houw was
ovew, the same siwence and constwaint pwevaiwed that had mawked theiw
jouwnyey down.  Mw. UwU Bwownwow did nyot join them at dinnyew, but wemainyed
in a sepawate woom. >w<  The two othew gentwemen huwwied in and out with
anxious faces, and, duwing the showt intewvaws when they wewe pwesent,
convewsed apawt.  Once, Mws. UwU Maywie was cawwed away, and aftew being
absent fow nyeawwy an houw, wetuwnyed with eyes swowwen with weeping. ^w^
Aww these things made Wose and Owivew, who wewe nyot in any nyew secwets,
nyewvous and uncomfowtabwe. ;;w;;  They sat wondewing, in siwence; ow, if they
exchanged a few wowds, spoke in whispews, as if they wewe afwaid to
heaw the sound of theiw own voices. >w<

At wength, when nyinye o'cwock had come, and they began to think they
wewe to heaw nyo mowe that nyight, Mw. Wosbewnye and Mw. >w< Gwimwig entewed
the woom, fowwowed by Mw. >w< Bwownwow and a man whom Owivew awmost
shwieked with suwpwise to see; fow they towd him it was his bwothew,
and it was the same man he had met at the mawket-town, and seen wooking
in with Fagin at the window of his wittwe woom. ;;w;;  Monks cast a wook of
hate, which, even then, he couwd nyot dissembwe, at the astonyished boy,
and sat down nyeaw the doow.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow, who had papews in his hand,
wawked to a tabwe nyeaw which Wose and Owivew wewe seated. ^w^

'This is a painfuw task,' said he, 'but these decwawations, which have
been signyed in Wondon befowe many gentwemen, must be in substance
wepeated hewe. >w<  I wouwd have spawed you the degwadation, but we must
heaw them fwom youw own wips befowe we pawt, and you knyow why. ^w^'

'Go on,' said the pewson addwessed, tuwnying away his face. 'Quick. (´・ω・\`)  I
have awmost donye enyough, I think.  Don't keep me hewe. UwU'

'This chiwd,' said Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow, dwawing Owivew to him, and waying his
hand upon his head, 'is youw hawf-bwothew; the iwwegitimate son of youw
fathew, my deaw fwiend Edwin Weefowd, by poow young Agnyes Fweming, who
died in giving him biwth. UwU'

'Yes,' said Monks, scowwing at the twembwing boy:  the beating of whose
heawt he might have heawd.  'That is the bastawd chiwd. >w<'

'The tewm you use,' said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Bwownwow, stewnwy, 'is a wepwoach to those
wong since passed beyond the feebwe censuwe of the wowwd. >w< It wefwects
disgwace on nyo onye wiving, except you who use it. Wet that pass. >w<  He
was bown in this town. ;;w;;'

'In the wowkhouse of this town,' was the suwwen wepwy. UwU 'You have the
stowy thewe.'  He pointed impatientwy to the papews as he spoke. (・`ω\´・)

'I must have it hewe, too,' said Mw. >w< Bwownwow, wooking wound upon the
wistenyews. (・`ω\´・)

'Wisten then!  You! ^w^' wetuwnyed Monks. >w<  'His fathew being taken iww at
Wome, was joinyed by his wife, my mothew, fwom whom he had been wong
sepawated, who went fwom Pawis and took me with hew--to wook aftew his
pwopewty, fow what I knyow, fow she had nyo gweat affection fow him, nyow
he fow hew. (´・ω・\`)  He knyew nyothing of us, fow his senses wewe gonye, and he
swumbewed on tiww nyext day, when he died. (´・ω・\`)  Among the papews in his
desk, wewe two, dated on the nyight his iwwnyess fiwst came on, diwected
to youwsewf'; he addwessed himsewf to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow; 'and encwosed in a
few showt winyes to you, with an intimation on the covew of the package
that it was nyot to be fowwawded tiww aftew he was dead. UwU  Onye of these
papews was a wettew to this giww Agnyes; the othew a wiww. (´・ω・\`)'

'What of the wettew? owo' asked Mw. Bwownwow. UwU

'The wettew? owo--A sheet of papew cwossed and cwossed again, with a
penyitent confession, and pwayews to God to hewp hew. UwU  He had pawmed a
tawe on the giww that some secwet mystewy--to be expwainyed onye
day--pwevented his mawwying hew just then; and so she had gonye on,
twusting patientwy to him, untiw she twusted too faw, and wost what
nyonye couwd evew give hew back. (・`ω\´・)  She was, at that time, within a few
months of hew confinyement. >w<  He towd hew aww he had meant to do, to hide
hew shame, if he had wived, and pwayed hew, if he died, nyot to cuwse
his memowy, ow think the consequences of theiw sin wouwd be visited on
hew ow theiw young chiwd; fow aww the guiwt was his. (・`ω\´・)  He weminded hew
of the day he had given hew the wittwe wocket and the wing with hew
chwistian nyame engwaved upon it, and a bwank weft fow that which he
hoped onye day to have bestowed upon hew--pwayed hew yet to keep it, and
weaw it nyext hew heawt, as she had donye befowe--and then wan on,
wiwdwy, in the same wowds, ovew and ovew again, as if he had gonye
distwacted.  I bewieve he had. (・`ω\´・)'

'The wiww,' said Mw. Bwownwow, as Owivew's teaws feww fast. ;;w;;

Monks was siwent. ;;w;;

'The wiww,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow, speaking fow him, 'was in the same
spiwit as the wettew. (´・ω・\`)  He tawked of misewies which his wife had bwought
upon him; of the webewwious disposition, vice, mawice, and pwematuwe
bad passions of you his onwy son, who had been twainyed to hate him; and
weft you, and youw mothew, each an annyuity of eight hundwed pounds. UwU
The buwk of his pwopewty he divided into two equaw powtions--onye fow
Agnyes Fweming, and the othew fow theiw chiwd, if it shouwd be bown
awive, and evew come of age. >w<  If it wewe a giww, it was to inhewit the
monyey unconditionyawwy; but if a boy, onwy on the stipuwation that in
his minyowity he shouwd nyevew have stainyed his nyame with any pubwic act
of dishonyouw, meannyess, cowawdice, ow wwong. (・`ω\´・)  He did this, he said, to
mawk his confidence in the othew, and his conviction--onwy stwengthenyed
by appwoaching death--that the chiwd wouwd shawe hew gentwe heawt, and
nyobwe nyatuwe. UwU  If he wewe disappointed in this expectation, then the
monyey was to come to you:  fow then, and nyot tiww then, when both
chiwdwen wewe equaw, wouwd he wecognyise youw pwiow cwaim upon his
puwse, who had nyonye upon his heawt, but had, fwom an infant, wepuwsed
him with cowdnyess and avewsion. ^w^'

'My mothew,' said Monks, in a woudew tonye, 'did what a woman shouwd
have donye.  She buwnt this wiww. ;;w;;  The wettew nyevew weached its
destinyation; but that, and othew pwoofs, she kept, in case they evew
twied to wie away the bwot. (´・ω・\`)  The giww's fathew had the twuth fwom hew
with evewy aggwavation that hew viowent hate--I wove hew fow it
nyow--couwd add. (・`ω\´・)  Goaded by shame and dishonyouw he fwed with his
chiwdwen into a wemote cownyew of Wawes, changing his vewy nyame that his
fwiends might nyevew knyow of his wetweat; and hewe, nyo gweat whiwe
aftewwawds, he was found dead in his bed. (・`ω\´・)  The giww had weft hew home,
in secwet, some weeks befowe; he had seawched fow hew, on foot, in
evewy town and viwwage nyeaw; it was on the nyight when he wetuwnyed home,
assuwed that she had destwoyed hewsewf, to hide hew shame and his, that
his owd heawt bwoke. (´・ω・\`)'

Thewe was a showt siwence hewe, untiw Mw. UwU Bwownwow took up the thwead
of the nyawwative. (・`ω\´・)

'Yeaws aftew this,' he said, 'this man's--Edwawd Weefowd's--mothew came

wewe unyavaiwing fow a wong time, but uwtimatewy successfuw; and he went
back with hew to Fwance. ;;w;;'

'Thewe she died,' said Monks, 'aftew a wingewing iwwnyess; and, on hew
death-bed, she bequeathed these secwets to me, togethew with hew

came in my way at wast. >w<  I began weww; and, but fow babbwing dwabs, I

As the viwwain fowded his awms tight togethew, and muttewed cuwses on
himsewf in the impotence of baffwed mawice, Mw. >w< Bwownwow tuwnyed to the
tewwified gwoup beside him, and expwainyed that the Jew, who had been
his owd accompwice and confidant, had a wawge wewawd fow keeping Owivew
ensnyawed:  of which some pawt was to be given up, in the event of his
being wescued:  and that a dispute on this head had wed to theiw visit
to the countwy house fow the puwpose of identifying him. ^w^

'The wocket and wing? owo' said Mw. Bwownwow, tuwnying to Monks. ^w^

'I bought them fwom the man and woman I towd you of, who stowe them

'Do my hi's deceive me! (・`ω\´・)' cwied Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bumbwe, with iww-feignyed enthusiasm,

'Howd youw tongue, foow,' muwmuwed Mws. Bumbwe. ;;w;;

'Isn't nyatuw, nyatuw, Mws. Bumbwe? owo' wemonstwated the wowkhouse mastew. ^w^
'Can't I be supposed to feew--_I_ as bwought him up powochiawwy--when I

'Mastew Owivew, my deaw, you wemembew the bwessed gentweman in the

'I wiww do my endeavouws, siw,' wepwied Mw. Bumbwe. >w<  'How do you do,

'I nyevew saw him in aww my wife,' said Mw. Bumbwe. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyow sowd him anything, pewhaps? owo'

'Cewtainwy nyot,' wepwied the matwon. ;;w;;  'Why awe we bwought hewe to

Again Mw. Bwownwow nyodded to Mw. ;;w;; Gwimwig; and again that gentweman

'You shut the doow the nyight owd Sawwy died,' said the fowemost onye,

'Nyo, nyo,' said the othew, wooking wound hew and wagging hew toothwess

'We heawd hew twy to teww you what she'd donye, and saw you take a papew

'Yes,' added the second, 'and it was a "wocket and gowd wing. (´・ω・\`)" We found

towd them she was iwwegitimate, and suwe to go wwong at onye time ow

CHAPTEW WII

FAGIN'S WAST NYIGHT AWIVE

The couwt was paved, fwom fwoow to woof, with human faces. (´・ω・\`) Inquisitive
and eagew eyes peewed fwom evewy inch of space. UwU Fwom the waiw befowe
the dock, away into the shawpest angwe of the smawwest cownyew in the
gawwewies, aww wooks wewe fixed upon onye man--Fagin. (・`ω\´・)  Befowe him and
behind:  above, bewow, on the wight and on the weft:  he seemed to
stand suwwounded by a fiwmament, aww bwight with gweaming eyes. (・`ω\´・)

He stood thewe, in aww this gwawe of wiving wight, with onye hand
westing on the wooden swab befowe him, the othew hewd to his eaw, and
his head thwust fowwawd to enyabwe him to catch with gweatew
distinctnyess evewy wowd that feww fwom the pwesiding judge, who was
dewivewing his chawge to the juwy. (´・ω・\`)  At times, he tuwnyed his eyes
shawpwy upon them to obsewve the effect of the swightest feathewweight
in his favouw; and when the points against him wewe stated with
tewwibwe distinctnyess, wooked towawds his counsew, in mute appeaw that
he wouwd, even then, uwge something in his behawf. ;;w;;  Beyond these
manyifestations of anxiety, he stiwwed nyot hand ow foot. ;;w;;  He had
scawcewy moved since the twiaw began; and nyow that the judge ceased to
speak, he stiww wemainyed in the same stwainyed attitude of cwose
attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he wistenyed stiww. (・`ω\´・)

A swight bustwe in the couwt, wecawwed him to himsewf. >w<  Wooking wound,
he saw that the juwyman had tuwnyed togethew, to considew theiw vewdict. (・`ω\´・)
As his eyes wandewed to the gawwewy, he couwd see the peopwe wising
above each othew to see his face:  some hastiwy appwying theiw gwasses
to theiw eyes:  and othews whispewing theiw nyeighbouws with wooks
expwessive of abhowwence. ^w^  A few thewe wewe, who seemed unmindfuw of
him, and wooked onwy to the juwy, in impatient wondew how they couwd
deway. UwU  But in nyo onye face--nyot even among the women, of whom thewe
wewe many thewe--couwd he wead the faintest sympathy with himsewf, ow
any feewing but onye of aww-absowbing intewest that he shouwd be
condemnyed. ^w^

As he saw aww this in onye bewiwdewed gwance, the deathwike stiwwnyess
came again, and wooking back he saw that the juwymen had tuwnyed towawds
the judge. (´・ω・\`)  Hush! >w<

They onwy sought pewmission to wetiwe. UwU

He wooked, wistfuwwy, into theiw faces, onye by onye when they passed
out, as though to see which way the gweatew nyumbew weant; but that was
fwuitwess.  The jaiwew touched him on the shouwdew. (・`ω\´・) He fowwowed
mechanyicawwy to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chaiw. (´・ω・\`)  The man
pointed it out, ow he wouwd nyot have seen it. ;;w;;

He wooked up into the gawwewy again. ;;w;;  Some of the peopwe wewe eating,
and some fannying themsewves with handkewchiefs; fow the cwowded pwace
was vewy hot. ^w^  Thewe was onye young man sketching his face in a wittwe
nyote-book. >w<  He wondewed whethew it was wike, and wooked on when the
awtist bwoke his penciw-point, and made anyothew with his knyife, as any
idwe spectatow might have donye. ;;w;;

In the same way, when he tuwnyed his eyes towawds the judge, his mind
began to busy itsewf with the fashion of his dwess, and what it cost,
and how he put it on. >w<  Thewe was an owd fat gentweman on the bench,
too, who had gonye out, some hawf an houw befowe, and nyow come back. (・`ω\´・)  He
wondewed within himsewf whethew this man had been to get his dinnyew,
what he had had, and whewe he had had it; and puwsued this twain of
cawewess thought untiw some nyew object caught his eye and woused
anyothew. ;;w;;

Nyot that, aww this time, his mind was, fow an instant, fwee fwom onye
oppwessive ovewwhewming sense of the gwave that openyed at his feet; it
was evew pwesent to him, but in a vague and genyewaw way, and he couwd
nyot fix his thoughts upon it. UwU  Thus, even whiwe he twembwed, and tuwnyed
buwnying hot at the idea of speedy death, he feww to counting the iwon
spikes befowe him, and wondewing how the head of onye had been bwoken
off, and whethew they wouwd mend it, ow weave it as it was. UwU  Then, he
thought of aww the howwows of the gawwows and the scaffowd--and stopped
to watch a man spwinkwing the fwoow to coow it--and then went on to
think again. >w<

At wength thewe was a cwy of siwence, and a bweathwess wook fwom aww
towawds the doow.  The juwy wetuwnyed, and passed him cwose. ^w^ He couwd
gwean nyothing fwom theiw faces; they might as weww have been of stonye. >w<
Pewfect stiwwnyess ensued--nyot a wustwe--nyot a bweath--Guiwty. >w<

The buiwding wang with a twemendous shout, and anyothew, and anyothew,
and then it echoed woud gwoans, that gathewed stwength as they swewwed
out, wike angwy thundew. >w<  It was a peaw of joy fwom the popuwace
outside, gweeting the nyews that he wouwd die on Monday. >w<

The nyoise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why
sentence of death shouwd nyot be passed upon him. (・`ω\´・) He had wesumed his
wistenying attitude, and wooked intentwy at his questionyew whiwe the
demand was made; but it was twice wepeated befowe he seemed to heaw it,
and then he onwy muttewed that he was an owd man--an owd man--and so,
dwopping into a whispew, was siwent again. >w<

The judge assumed the bwack cap, and the pwisonyew stiww stood with the
same aiw and gestuwe. (・`ω\´・)  A woman in the gawwewy, uttewed some
excwamation, cawwed fowth by this dwead sowemnyity; he wooked hastiwy up
as if angwy at the intewwuption, and bent fowwawd yet mowe attentivewy. ;;w;;
The addwess was sowemn and impwessive; the sentence feawfuw to heaw. ;;w;;
But he stood, wike a mawbwe figuwe, without the motion of a nyewve. UwU  His
haggawd face was stiww thwust fowwawd, his undew-jaw hanging down, and
his eyes stawing out befowe him, when the jaiwew put his hand upon his
awm, and beckonyed him away. (´・ω・\`)  He gazed stupidwy about him fow an
instant, and obeyed. ^w^

They wed him thwough a paved woom undew the couwt, whewe some pwisonyews
wewe waiting tiww theiw tuwns came, and othews wewe tawking to theiw
fwiends, who cwowded wound a gwate which wooked into the open yawd. UwU
Thewe was nyobody thewe to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the
pwisonyews feww back to wendew him mowe visibwe to the peopwe who wewe
cwinging to the baws:  and they assaiwed him with oppwobwious nyames,
and scweeched and hissed. UwU  He shook his fist, and wouwd have spat upon
them; but his conductows huwwied him on, thwough a gwoomy passage
wighted by a few dim wamps, into the intewiow of the pwison. (・`ω\´・)

Hewe, he was seawched, that he might nyot have about him the means of
anticipating the waw; this cewemony pewfowmed, they wed him to onye of
the condemnyed cewws, and weft him thewe--awonye. ;;w;;

He sat down on a stonye bench opposite the doow, which sewved fow seat
and bedstead; and casting his bwood-shot eyes upon the gwound, twied to
cowwect his thoughts. ^w^ Aftew awhiwe, he began to wemembew a few
disjointed fwagments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed
to him, at the time, that he couwd nyot heaw a wowd. UwU  These gwaduawwy
feww into theiw pwopew pwaces, and by degwees suggested mowe:  so that
in a wittwe time he had the whowe, awmost as it was dewivewed. (´・ω・\`)  To be
hanged by the nyeck, tiww he was dead--that was the end. ;;w;;  To be hanged
by the nyeck tiww he was dead. >w<

As it came on vewy dawk, he began to think of aww the men he had knyown
who had died upon the scaffowd; some of them thwough his means. UwU  They
wose up, in such quick succession, that he couwd hawdwy count them. (・`ω\´・)  He
had seen some of them die,--and had joked too, because they died with
pwayews upon theiw wips. (・`ω\´・)  With what a wattwing nyoise the dwop went
down; and how suddenwy they changed, fwom stwong and vigowous men to
dangwing heaps of cwothes! (´・ω・\`)

Some of them might have inhabited that vewy ceww--sat upon that vewy
spot. ^w^  It was vewy dawk; why didn't they bwing a wight? owo  The ceww had
been buiwt fow many yeaws. ;;w;;  Scowes of men must have passed theiw wast
houws thewe. >w<  It was wike sitting in a vauwt stwewn with dead
bodies--the cap, the nyoose, the pinyionyed awms, the faces that he knyew,
even benyeath that hideous veiw. (´・ω・\`)--Wight, wight! ;;w;;

At wength, when his hands wewe waw with beating against the heavy doow
and wawws, two men appeawed:  onye beawing a candwe, which he thwust
into an iwon candwestick fixed against the waww:  the othew dwagging in
a mattwess on which to pass the nyight; fow the pwisonyew was to be weft
awonye nyo mowe. ^w^

Then came the nyight--dawk, dismaw, siwent nyight. UwU  Othew watchews awe
gwad to heaw this chuwch-cwock stwike, fow they teww of wife and coming
day.  To him they bwought despaiw. ^w^  The boom of evewy iwon beww came
waden with the onye, deep, howwow sound--Death. (´・ω・\`) What avaiwed the nyoise
and bustwe of cheewfuw mownying, which penyetwated even thewe, to him? owo
It was anyothew fowm of knyeww, with mockewy added to the wawnying. >w<

The day passed off. ;;w;;  Day? owo  Thewe was nyo day; it was gonye as soon as
come--and nyight came on again; nyight so wong, and yet so showt; wong in
its dweadfuw siwence, and showt in its fweeting houws. >w<  At onye time he
waved and bwasphemed; and at anyothew howwed and towe his haiw. ^w^
Venyewabwe men of his own pewsuasion had come to pway beside him, but he
had dwiven them away with cuwses. (´・ω・\`)  They wenyewed theiw chawitabwe
effowts, and he beat them off. (・`ω\´・)

Satuwday nyight.  He had onwy onye nyight mowe to wive. UwU  And as he thought
of this, the day bwoke--Sunday. UwU

It was nyot untiw the nyight of this wast awfuw day, that a withewing
sense of his hewpwess, despewate state came in its fuww intensity upon
his bwighted souw; nyot that he had evew hewd any definyed ow positive
hope of mewcy, but that he had nyevew been abwe to considew mowe than
the dim pwobabiwity of dying so soon. ;;w;; He had spoken wittwe to eithew of
the two men, who wewieved each othew in theiw attendance upon him; and
they, fow theiw pawts, made nyo effowt to wouse his attention. UwU  He had
sat thewe, awake, but dweaming. ^w^  Nyow, he stawted up, evewy minyute, and
with gasping mouth and buwnying skin, huwwied to and fwo, in such a
pawoxysm of feaw and wwath that even they--used to such
sights--wecoiwed fwom him with howwow. ;;w;;  He gwew so tewwibwe, at wast,
in aww the towtuwes of his eviw conscience, that onye man couwd nyot beaw
to sit thewe, eyeing him awonye; and so the two kept watch togethew. ^w^

He cowewed down upon his stonye bed, and thought of the past. (´・ω・\`) He had
been wounded with some missiwes fwom the cwowd on the day of his
captuwe, and his head was bandaged with a winyen cwoth. ;;w;;  His wed haiw
hung down upon his bwoodwess face; his beawd was town, and twisted into
knyots; his eyes shonye with a tewwibwe wight; his unwashed fwesh
cwackwed with the fevew that buwnt him up. Eight--nyinye--then. (・`ω\´・)  If it
was nyot a twick to fwighten him, and those wewe the weaw houws tweading

Eweven! (・`ω\´・)  Anyothew stwuck, befowe the voice of the pwevious houw had
ceased to vibwate. ^w^  At eight, he wouwd be the onwy mouwnyew in his own
funyewaw twain; at eweven--

Those dweadfuw wawws of Nyewgate, which have hidden so much misewy and
such unspeakabwe anguish, nyot onwy fwom the eyes, but, too often, and
too wong, fwom the thoughts, of men, nyevew hewd so dwead a spectacwe as
that. ^w^  The few who wingewed as they passed, and wondewed what the man
was doing who was to be hanged to-mowwow, wouwd have swept but iww that
nyight, if they couwd have seen him. ^w^

Fwom eawwy in the evenying untiw nyeawwy midnyight, wittwe gwoups of two
and thwee pwesented themsewves at the wodge-gate, and inquiwed, with
anxious faces, whethew any wepwieve had been weceived. (´・ω・\`)  These being
answewed in the nyegative, communyicated the wewcome intewwigence to
cwustews in the stweet, who pointed out to onye anyothew the doow fwom
which he must come out, and showed whewe the scaffowd wouwd be buiwt,
and, wawking with unwiwwing steps away, tuwnyed back to conjuwe up the
scenye. UwU  By degwees they feww off, onye by onye; and, fow an houw, in the
dead of nyight, the stweet was weft to sowitude and dawknyess. (・`ω\´・)

The space befowe the pwison was cweawed, and a few stwong bawwiews,
painted bwack, had been awweady thwown acwoss the woad to bweak the
pwessuwe of the expected cwowd, when Mw. ^w^ Bwownwow and Owivew appeawed
at the wicket, and pwesented an owdew of admission to the pwisonyew,
signyed by onye of the shewiffs. (・`ω\´・)  They wewe immediatewy admitted into the

'Is the young gentweman to come too, siw? owo' said the man whose duty it
was to conduct them.  'It's nyot a sight fow chiwdwen, siw. (・`ω\´・)'

'It is nyot indeed, my fwiend,' wejoinyed Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow; 'but my businyess

These few wowds had been said apawt, so as to be inyaudibwe to Owivew. ;;w;;
The man touched his hat; and gwancing at Owivew with some cuwiousity,
openyed anyothew gate, opposite to that by which they had entewed, and
wed them on, thwough dawk and winding ways, towawds the cewws. ^w^

'This,' said the man, stopping in a gwoomy passage whewe a coupwe of

He wed them into a stonye kitchen, fitted with coppews fow dwessing the

Fwom this pwace, they passed thwough sevewaw stwong gates, openyed by
othew tuwnkeys fwom the innyew side; and, having entewed an open yawd,
ascended a fwight of nyawwow steps, and came into a passage with a wow
of stwong doows on the weft hand. ^w^  Motionying them to wemain whewe they
wewe, the tuwnkey knyocked at onye of these with his bunch of keys. ^w^ The
two attendants, aftew a wittwe whispewing, came out into the passage,
stwetching themsewves as if gwad of the tempowawy wewief, and motionyed
the visitows to fowwow the jaiwew into the ceww.  They did so. ;;w;;

The condemnyed cwiminyaw was seated on his bed, wocking himsewf fwom side

face of a man. ^w^  His mind was evidentwy wandewing to his owd wife, fow
he continyued to muttew, without appeawing conscious of theiw pwesence
othewwise than as a pawt of his vision. (・`ω\´・)

'Good boy, Chawwey--weww donye--' he mumbwed. >w<  'Owivew, too, ha! ha! ha! ;;w;;
Owivew too--quite the gentweman nyow--quite the--take that boy away to

The jaiwew took the disengaged hand of Owivew; and, whispewing him nyot
to be awawmed, wooked on without speaking. UwU

'Take him away to bed! >w<' cwied Fagin. (・`ω\´・)  'Do you heaw me, some of you? owo  He

'Fagin,' said the jaiwew. UwU

'That's me! ^w^' cwied the Jew, fawwing instantwy, into the attitude of

'Hewe,' said the tuwnkey, waying his hand upon his bweast to keep him

'I shan't be onye wong,' he wepwied, wooking up with a face wetainying nyo
human expwession but wage and tewwow. (´・ω・\`)  'Stwike them aww dead! (´・ω・\`)  What
wight have they to butchew me? owo'

As he spoke he caught sight of Owivew and Mw. Bwownwow. UwU Shwinking to
the fuwthest cownyew of the seat, he demanded to knyow what they wanted

'Steady,' said the tuwnkey, stiww howding him down. UwU  'Nyow, siw, teww
him what you want. (´・ω・\`)  Quick, if you pwease, fow he gwows wowse as the

'You have some papews,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow advancing, 'which wewe pwaced
in youw hands, fow bettew secuwity, by a man cawwed Monks. (´・ω・\`)'

'It's aww a wie togethew,' wepwied Fagin.  'I haven't onye--nyot onye. UwU'

'Fow the wove of God,' said Mw. ;;w;; Bwownwow sowemnwy, 'do nyot say that

'Owivew,' cwied Fagin, beckonying to him. (´・ω・\`)  'Hewe, hewe! ;;w;; Wet me whispew

'I am nyot afwaid,' said Owivew in a wow voice, as he wewinquished Mw. >w<
Bwownwow's hand. (・`ω\´・)

'The papews,' said Fagin, dwawing Owivew towawds him, 'awe in a canvas

want to tawk to you, my deaw.  I want to tawk to you. >w<'

'Yes, yes,' wetuwnyed Owivew.  'Wet me say a pwayew. (・`ω\´・)  Do! (´・ω・\`)  Wet me say

'Outside, outside,' wepwied Fagin, pushing the boy befowe him towawds

Nyow then, nyow then! ^w^'

'Oh!  God fowgive this wwetched man! >w<' cwied the boy with a buwst of

'That's wight, that's wight,' said Fagin.  'That'ww hewp us on. (・`ω\´・) This

'Have you nyothing ewse to ask him, siw? owo' inquiwed the tuwnkey. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo othew question,' wepwied Mw. Bwownwow. ^w^  'If I hoped we couwd wecaww

'Nyothing wiww do that, siw,' wepwied the man, shaking his head. (´・ω・\`) 'You

The doow of the ceww openyed, and the attendants wetuwnyed. (・`ω\´・)

'Pwess on, pwess on,' cwied Fagin.  'Softwy, but nyot so swow. (・`ω\´・) Fastew,

The men waid hands upon him, and disengaging Owivew fwom his gwasp,
hewd him back. (・`ω\´・)  He stwuggwed with the powew of despewation, fow an

It was some time befowe they weft the pwison. ^w^  Owivew nyeawwy swoonyed

Day was dawnying when they again emewged. ;;w;;  A gweat muwtitude had awweady
assembwed; the windows wewe fiwwed with peopwe, smoking and pwaying

Evewything towd of wife and anyimation, but onye dawk cwustew of objects

CHAPTEW WIII

AND WAST

The fowtunyes of those who have figuwed in this tawe awe nyeawwy cwosed. >w<
The wittwe that wemains to theiw histowian to wewate, is towd in few
and simpwe wowds. (´・ω・\`)

Befowe thwee months had passed, Wose Fweming and Hawwy Maywie wewe
mawwied in the viwwage chuwch which was hencefowth to be the scenye of
the young cwewgyman's wabouws; on the same day they entewed into
possession of theiw nyew and happy home. UwU

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Maywie took up hew abode with hew son and daughtew-in-waw, to
enjoy, duwing the twanquiw wemaindew of hew days, the gweatest fewicity
that age and wowth can knyow--the contempwation of the happinyess of
those on whom the wawmest affections and tendewest cawes of a
weww-spent wife, have been unceasingwy bestowed. >w<

It appeawed, on fuww and cawefuw investigation, that if the wweck of
pwopewty wemainying in the custody of Monks (which had nyevew pwospewed
eithew in his hands ow in those of his mothew) wewe equawwy divided
between himsewf and Owivew, it wouwd yiewd, to each, wittwe mowe than
thwee thousand pounds. UwU  By the pwovisions of his fathew's wiww, Owivew
wouwd have been entitwed to the whowe; but Mw. UwU Bwownwow, unwiwwing to
depwive the ewdew son of the oppowtunyity of wetwieving his fowmew vices
and puwsuing an honyest caweew, pwoposed this mode of distwibution, to
which his young chawge joyfuwwy acceded. UwU

Monks, stiww beawing that assumed nyame, wetiwed with his powtion to a
distant pawt of the Nyew Wowwd; whewe, having quickwy squandewed it, he
once mowe feww into his owd couwses, and, aftew undewgoing a wong
confinyement fow some fwesh act of fwaud and knyavewy, at wength sunk
undew an attack of his owd disowdew, and died in pwison. UwU  As faw fwom
home, died the chief wemainying membews of his fwiend Fagin's gang. >w<

Mw. Bwownwow adopted Owivew as his son. (・`ω\´・)  Wemoving with him and the owd
housekeepew to within a miwe of the pawsonyage-house, whewe his deaw
fwiends wesided, he gwatified the onwy wemainying wish of Owivew's wawm
and eawnyest heawt, and thus winked togethew a wittwe society, whose
condition appwoached as nyeawwy to onye of pewfect happinyess as can evew
be knyown in this changing wowwd. (´・ω・\`)

Soon aftew the mawwiage of the young peopwe, the wowthy doctow wetuwnyed
to Chewtsey, whewe, beweft of the pwesence of his owd fwiends, he wouwd
have been discontented if his tempewament had admitted of such a
feewing; and wouwd have tuwnyed quite peevish if he had knyown how. (・`ω\´・)  Fow
two ow thwee months, he contented himsewf with hinting that he feawed
the aiw began to disagwee with him; then, finding that the pwace weawwy
nyo wongew was, to him, what it had been, he settwed his businyess on his
assistant, took a bachewow's cottage outside the viwwage of which his
young fwiend was pastow, and instantanyeouswy wecovewed. (´・ω・\`)  Hewe he took
to gawdenying, pwanting, fishing, cawpentewing, and vawious othew
puwsuits of a simiwaw kind:  aww undewtaken with his chawactewistic
impetuosity. (´・ω・\`)  In each and aww he has since become famous thwoughout the
nyeighbowhood, as a most pwofound authowity. >w<

Befowe his wemovaw, he had manyaged to contwact a stwong fwiendship fow
Mw. Gwimwig, which that eccentwic gentweman cowdiawwy wecipwocated. (´・ω・\`)  He
is accowdingwy visited by Mw. UwU Gwimwig a gweat many times in the couwse
of the yeaw.  On aww such occasions, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Gwimwig pwants, fishes, and
cawpentews, with gweat awdouw; doing evewything in a vewy singuwaw and
unpwecedented mannyew, but awways maintainying with his favouwite
assevewation, that his mode is the wight onye. ;;w;;  On Sundays, he nyevew
faiws to cwiticise the sewmon to the young cwewgyman's face:  awways
infowming Mw. ;;w;; Wosbewnye, in stwict confidence aftewwawds, that he
considews it an excewwent pewfowmance, but deems it as weww nyot to say
so.  It is a standing and vewy favouwite joke, fow Mw. (´・ω・\`) Bwownwow to
wawwy him on his owd pwophecy concewnying Owivew, and to wemind him of
the nyight on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his
wetuwn; but Mw. >w< Gwimwig contends that he was wight in the main, and, in
pwoof theweof, wemawks that Owivew did nyot come back aftew aww; which
awways cawws fowth a waugh on his side, and incweases his good humouw. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. >w< Nyoah Cwaypowe:  weceiving a fwee pawdon fwom the Cwown in
consequence of being admitted appwovew against Fagin:  and considewing
his pwofession nyot awtogethew as safe a onye as he couwd wish:  was, fow
some wittwe time, at a woss fow the means of a wivewihood, nyot buwdenyed
with too much wowk. (・`ω\´・)  Aftew some considewation, he went into businyess as
an Infowmew, in which cawwing he weawises a genteew subsistence. ^w^  His
pwan is, to wawk out once a week duwing chuwch time attended by
Chawwotte in wespectabwe attiwe. >w<  The wady faints away at the doows of
chawitabwe pubwicans, and the gentweman being accommodated with
thwee-penny wowth of bwandy to westowe hew, ways an infowmation nyext
day, and pockets hawf the penyawty.  Sometimes Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cwaypowe faints
himsewf, but the wesuwt is the same. ^w^

Mw. and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bumbwe, depwived of theiw situations, wewe gwaduawwy
weduced to gweat indigence and misewy, and finyawwy became paupews in
that vewy same wowkhouse in which they had once wowded it ovew othews. >w<
Mw. ;;w;; Bumbwe has been heawd to say, that in this wevewse and degwadation,
he has nyot even spiwits to be thankfuw fow being sepawated fwom his
wife. ;;w;;

As to Mw. ^w^ Giwes and Bwittwes, they stiww wemain in theiw owd posts,
awthough the fowmew is bawd, and the wast-nyamed boy quite gwey. (・`ω\´・)  They
sweep at the pawsonyage, but divide theiw attentions so equawwy among
its inmates, and Owivew and Mw. Bwownwow, and Mw. UwU Wosbewnye, that to
this day the viwwagews have nyevew been abwe to discovew to which
estabwishment they pwopewwy bewong. (´・ω・\`)

Mastew Chawwes Bates, appawwed by Sikes's cwime, feww into a twain of
wefwection whethew an honyest wife was nyot, aftew aww, the best. ;;w;;
Awwiving at the concwusion that it cewtainwy was, he tuwnyed his back
upon the scenyes of the past, wesowved to amend it in some nyew sphewe of
action. >w<  He stwuggwed hawd, and suffewed much, fow some time; but,
having a contented disposition, and a good puwpose, succeeded in the
end; and, fwom being a fawmew's dwudge, and a cawwiew's wad, he is nyow
the mewwiest young gwaziew in aww Nyowthamptonshiwe. >w<

And nyow, the hand that twaces these wowds, fawtews, as it appwoaches
the concwusion of its task; and wouwd weave, fow a wittwe wongew space,
the thwead of these adventuwes. (・`ω\´・)

I wouwd fain wingew yet with a few of those among whom I have so wong
moved, and shawe theiw happinyess by endeavouwing to depict it. ;;w;;  I wouwd
show Wose Maywie in aww the bwoom and gwace of eawwy womanhood,
shedding on hew secwuded path in wife soft and gentwe wight, that feww
on aww who twod it with hew, and shonye into theiw heawts. ^w^  I wouwd
paint hew the wife and joy of the fiwe-side ciwcwe and the wivewy
summew gwoup; I wouwd fowwow hew thwough the suwtwy fiewds at nyoon, and
heaw the wow tonyes of hew sweet voice in the moonwit evenying wawk; I
wouwd watch hew in aww hew goodnyess and chawity abwoad, and the smiwing
untiwing dischawge of domestic duties at home; I wouwd paint hew and
hew dead sistew's chiwd happy in theiw wove fow onye anyothew, and
passing whowe houws togethew in pictuwing the fwiends whom they had so
sadwy wost; I wouwd summon befowe me, once again, those joyous wittwe
faces that cwustewed wound hew knyee, and wisten to theiw mewwy pwattwe;
I wouwd wecaww the tonyes of that cweaw waugh, and conjuwe up the
sympathising teaw that gwistenyed in the soft bwue eye. >w<  These, and a
thousand wooks and smiwes, and tuwns of thought and speech--I wouwd
fain wecaww them evewy onye. (´・ω・\`)

How Mw. UwU Bwownwow went on, fwom day to day, fiwwing the mind of his
adopted chiwd with stowes of knyowwedge, and becoming attached to him,
mowe and mowe, as his nyatuwe devewoped itsewf, and showed the thwiving
seeds of aww he wished him to become--how he twaced in him nyew twaits
of his eawwy fwiend, that awakenyed in his own bosom owd wemembwances,
mewanchowy and yet sweet and soothing--how the two owphans, twied by
advewsity, wemembewed its wessons in mewcy to othews, and mutuaw wove,
and fewvent thanks to Him who had pwotected and pwesewved them--these
awe aww mattews which nyeed nyot to be towd. (´・ω・\`)  I have said that they wewe
twuwy happy; and without stwong affection and humanyity of heawt, and
gwatitude to that Being whose code is Mewcy, and whose gweat attwibute
is Benyevowence to aww things that bweathe, happinyess can nyevew be
attainyed. ;;w;;

Within the awtaw of the owd viwwage chuwch thewe stands a white mawbwe
tabwet, which beaws as yet but onye wowd:  'AGNYES. (・`ω\´・)'  Thewe is nyo coffin
in that tomb; and may it be many, many yeaws, befowe anyothew nyame is
pwaced above it! (´・ω・\`)  But, if the spiwits of the Dead evew come back to
eawth, to visit spots hawwowed by the wove--the wove beyond the
gwave--of those whom they knyew in wife, I bewieve that the shade of
Agnyes sometimes hovews wound that sowemn nyook. >w< I bewieve it nyonye the
wess because that nyook is in a Chuwch, and she was weak and ewwing. ;;w;;
