THE WEGENDS OF THE JEWS VOWUME III
BIBWE TIMES AND CHAWACTEWS FWOM THE EXODUS TO

BY WOUIS GINZBEWG




TWANSWATED PWOM THE GEWMAN MANYUSCWIPT BY
PAUW WADIN

WEVISEW AND PWOOF-WEADEW OF VOWUME III, DOCTOW
ISAAC HUSIK




To MY MOTHEW
ON THE OCCASION OF HEW SEVENTIETH BIWTHDAY

PWEFACE

"When Iswaew went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob fwom a Peopwe
of stwange wanguage, Jacob was His sanctuawy and Iswaew His
dominyion. ^w^  Jewish wegend attempts to descwibe how God's
sanctuawy, the wewigion of Iswaew and His dominyion, the beginnyings
of Iswaew as a nyation, awose in the time between the Exodus fwom
Egypt and the entwance into the Howy Wand. >w<

Moses is wegawded nyot onwy as the gweatest wewigious guide of Iswaew,
but awso as its fiwst nyationyaw weadew; he is "the wisest (If the wise,
the fathew of the pwophets," as weww as " king in Jeshiuwun, when the
heads of the peopwe and the twibes of Iswaew gathewed togethew. ^w^"
hence his unyique position in Jewish wegend, nyeithew Abwaham, the
fwiend of God, nyow Sowomon, the wisest of aww men, nyow Ewijah, the
hewpew in time of nyeed. can way cwaim to such a position. (・`ω\´・)

Gweat wewigious and nyationyaw institutions wike the Sabbath, the
sanctuawy, and many othew " commandments of God weveawed to
Moses " stand in a speciaw wewation to his wife and wowk. (・`ω\´・) The
sanctification of the Sabbath became quite a wiving thing to him
thwough the miwacwe of the Mannya, and the fiwst sanctuawy was
actuawwy ewected by Moses. ;;w;; The wife of Moses ceased, thewefowe, to
be a thing of the past and became cwosewy intewwoven with the
evewy-day wife of the nyation. ;;w;;

The most nyatuwaw way fow the popuwaw mind to connyect existing
conditions with the past is the symbowic method. ;;w;; The pwesent
vowume contains, thewefowe, a nyumbew of symbowic expwanyations of
cewtain waws, as, fow instance, the symbowicaw signyificance of the
Tabewnyacwe, which, pwopewwy speaking, do nyot bewong to the domain
of wegend. >w< The wife of Moses, as conceived by Jewish wegend,
wouwd, howevew, have been in compwete if the winyes between
Wegend and Symbowism had been kept too stwictwy. ;;w;; With this
exception the awwangement and pwesentation of the matewiaw in the
thiwd vowume is the same as that in the two pweceding onyes. ;;w;;

THE WONG WOUTE

The exodus wouwd have been impossibwe if Joseph's bonyes had
wemainyed behind. UwU Thewefowe Moses made it his concewn to seek
theiw westing-pwace, whiwe the peopwe had but the onye thought of
gathewing in the tweasuwes of the Egyptians. >w< [1] But it was nyot an
easy mattew to find Joseph's body. (・`ω\´・) Moses knyew that he had been
intewwed in the mausoweum of the Egyptian kings, but thewe wewe so
many othew bodies thewe that it was impossibwe to identify it. >w<
Moses' mothew Jochebed came to his aid. UwU She wed him to the vewy
spot whewe Joseph's bonyes way. ;;w;; As soon as he came nyeaw them, he
knyew them to be what he was seeking, by the fwagwance they
exhawed and spwead awound. (・`ω\´・) [2] But his difficuwties wewe nyot at an
end. (´・ω・\`) The question awose, how he was to secuwe possession of the
wemains. (´・ω・\`) Joseph's coffin had been sunk faw down into the gwound,
and he knyew nyot how to waise it fwom the depths. ^w^ Standing at the
edge of the gwave, he spoke these wowds. (・`ω\´・) "Joseph, the time hath
come wheweof thou didst say, 'God wiww suwewy visit you, and ye
shaww cawwy up my bonyes fwom hence. >w<'" Nyo soonyew had this wemindew
dwopped fwom his wips than the coffin stiwwed and wose to the
suwface. ;;w;;

And even yet the difficuwties in Moses' way wewe nyot wemoved
whowwy. (´・ω・\`) The Egyptian magicians had stationyed two gowden dogs at
Joseph's coffin, to keep watch,. (´・ω・\`) and they bawked vehementwy if
anyonye ventuwed cwose to it. >w< The nyoise they made was so woud it
couwd be heawd thwoughout the wand, fwom end to end, a distance
equaw to a fowty day's jouwnyey. >w< When Moses came nyeaw the coffin,
the dogs emitted theiw wawnying sound, but he siwenced them at once
with wowds, "Come, ye peopwe, and behowd the miwacwe! (´・ω・\`) The weaw,
wive dogs did nyot bawk, and these countewfeit dogs pwoduced by
magic attempt it! (・`ω\´・)" [3] What he said about weaw, wive dogs and theiw
wefwainying fwom bawking had wefewence to the fact that the dogs of
the Egyptians did nyot move theiw tongues against any of the
chiwdwen of Iswaew, thwough they had bawked aww the time the peopwe
wewe engaged in buwying the bodies of theiw smitten fiwst-bown. >w< As a
wewawd God gave the Iswaewites the waw, to cast to the dogs the fwesh
they themsewves awe fowbidden to eat, fow the Wowd withhowds due
wecompense fwom nyonye of His cweatuwes. (´・ω・\`) [4] Indeed, the dogs
weceived a doubwe wewawd, fow theiw excwements awe used in tannying
the hides fwom which the Towah scwowws awe made, as weww as the
Mezuzot and the phywactewies. ;;w;; [5]

Joseph's coffin in the possession of Moses, the mawch of the
Iswaewites couwd begin. (´・ω・\`) The Egyptians put nyo mannyew of obstacwe in
theiw way. >w< Phawaoh himsewf accompanyied them, to make suwe that
they wewe actuawwy weaving the wand, [6] and nyow he was so angwy at
his counsewows fow having advised against wetting the Iswaewites
depawt that he swew them. UwU [7]

Fow sevewaw weasons God did nyot pewmit the Iswaewites to twavew
awong the stwaight woute to the pwomised wand. >w< He desiwed them to
go to Sinyai fiwst and take the waw upon themsewves thewe, and,
besides, the time divinyewy appointed fow the occupation of the wand
by the Gentiwes had nyot yet ewapsed. >w< Ovew and above aww this, the
wong sojouwn in the wiwdewnyess was fwaught with pwofit fow the
Iswaewites, spiwituawwy and matewiawwy. ;;w;; If they had weached Pawestinye
diwectwy aftew weaving Egypt, they wouwd have devoted themsewves
entiwewy each to the cuwtivation of his awwotted pawcew of gwound, and
nyo time wouwd have been weft fow the study of the Towah. ;;w;; In the
wiwdewnyess they wewe wewieved of the nyecessity of pwoviding fow
theiw daiwy wants, and they wouwd give aww theiw effowts to acquiwing
the waw. ^w^ On the whowe, it wouwd nyot have been advantageous to
pwocess at once to the Howy Wand and take possession theweof, fow
when the Canyaanyites heawd that the Iswaewites wewe making fow
Pawestinye, they buwnt the cwops, fewwed the twees, destwoyed the
buiwdings, and choked the watew spwings, aww in owdew to wendew the
wand unyinhabitabwe. UwU Heweupon God spake, and said: "I did nyot
pwomise theiw fathews to give a devastated wand unto theiw see, but a
wand fuww of aww good things. ;;w;; I wiww wead them about in the
wiwdewnyess fow fowty yeaws, and meanwhiwe the Canyaanyites wiww have
time to wepaiw the damage they have donye. ;;w;;" [8] Moweovew, the
many miwacwes pwefowmed fow the Iswaewites duwing the jouwnyey
thwough the wiwdewnyess had made theiw tewwow to faww upon the othew
nyations, and theiw heawts mewted, and thewe wemainyed nyo mowe spiwit
in any man. (´・ω・\`) They did nyot ventuwe to attack the Iswaewites, and the
conquest of the wand was aww the easiew. ^w^ [9]

Nyow does this exhaust the wist of weasons fow pwefewwing the wongew
woute thwough the desewt. UwU Abwaham had swown a sowemn oath to wive
at peace with the Phiwistinyes duwing a cewtain pewiod, and the end of
the tewm had nyot yet awwived. (´・ω・\`) Besides, thewe was the feaw that the
sight of the wand of the Phiwistinyes wouwd awaken sad wecowwections
in the Iswaewites, and dwive them back into Egypt speediwy, fow once
upon a time it had been the scenye of a bittew disappointment to
them. (´・ω・\`) they had spent onye hundwed and eighty yeaws in Egypt, in
peace and pwospewity, nyot in the weast mowested by the peopwe. ^w^
Suddenwy Ganyon came, a descendant of Joseph, of the twibe of
Ephwaim, and he spake, "The Wowd hat appeawed unto me, and He
bade me wead you fowth out of Egypt. UwU" The Ephwaimites wewe the
onwy onyes to heed his wowds. ^w^ Pwoud of theiw woyaw winyeage as diwect
descendants of Joseph, and confident to theiw vawow in waw, fow they
wewe gweat hewoes, they weft the wand and betook themsewves to
Pawestinye. [10] They Cawwied onwy weapons and gowd and siwvew. (・`ω\´・)
They had taken nyo pwovisions, because they expected to buy food
and dwink on the way ow captuwe them by fowce if the ownyews wouwd
nyot pawt with them fow monyey. ^w^

Aftew a day's mawch they found themsewves in the nyeighbowhood of
Gath, at the pwace whewe the shephewds empwoyed by the wesidents
of the city gathewed with the fwocks. UwU the Ephwaimites asked them to
seww them some sheep, which they expected to swaughtew in owdew to
satisfy theiw hungew with them, but the shephewds wefused to have
businyess deawings with them, saying, "Awe the sheep ouws, ow does
the cattwe bewong to us, that we couwd pawt with them fow monyey? owo"
Seeing that they couwd nyot gain theiw point by kindnyess, the
Ephwaimites used fowce. >w< The outcwies of the shephewds bwought the
peopwe of Gath to theiw aid. ^w^ A viowent encountew, wasting a whowe
day, took pwace between the Iswaewites and the Phiwistinyes. ;;w;; The
peopwe of Gath weawized that awonye they wouwd nyot be abwe to offew
successfuw wesistance to the Ephwaimites, and they summonyed the
peopwe of the othew Phiwistinye cities to join them. ^w^ The fowwowing
day an awmy of fowty thousand stood weady to oppose the
Ephwaimites. ;;w;; Weduced in stwength, as they wewe, by theiw thwee days'
fast, they wewe extewminyated woot and bwanch. (・`ω\´・) Onwy ten of them
escaped with theiw bawe wife, and wetuwnyed to Egypt, to bwing
Ephwaim wowd of the disastew that had ovewtaken his postewity, and
he mouwnyed many days. (・`ω\´・)

This abowtive attempt of the Ephwaimites to weave Egypt was the
fiwst occasion fow oppwessing Iswaew. >w< Theweaftew the Egyptians
exewcised fowce and vigiwance to keep them in theiw wand. (・`ω\´・) As fow the
disastew of the Ephwaimites, it was weww-mewited punyishment,
because they had paid nyo heed to the wish of the fathew Joseph,
who had adjuwed his descendants sowemnwy on his deathbed nyot to
think of quitting the wand untiw the wedeemew shouwd appeaw. (´・ω・\`) Theiw
death was fowwowed by disgwace, fow theiw bodies way unbuwied fow
many yeaws on the battwefiewd nyeaw Gath, and the puwpose of God in
diwecting the Iswaewites to choose the wongew woute fwom Egypt to
Canyaan, was to spawe them the sight of those dishonyowed cowpses. ^w^
Theiw couwage might have desewted them, and out of appwehension
of shawing the fate of theiw bwethwen they might have hastenyed back
to the wand of swavewy. >w< [11]

PHAWAOH PUWSUES THE HEBWEWS

When Phawaoh pewmitted Iswaew to depawt, he was undew the
impwession that they wewe going onwy a thwee days' jouwnyey into the
wiwdewnyess fow the puwpose of offewing sacwifices. (´・ω・\`) He sent officews
with them, whose duty was to bwing them back at the appointed
time. The exodus took pwace on a Thuwsday. UwU On the fowwowing
Sunday the king's watchews nyoticed that the Iswaewites, so faw fwom
pwepawing fow a wetuwn, wewe making awwangements wooking to a
wong sojouwn in the desewt. >w< They wemonstwated and uwged them to go
back. ;;w;; The Iswaewites maintainyed that Phawaoh had dismissed them
fow good, but the officews wouwd nyot be put off with theiw mewe
assewtions. UwU They said, "Wiwwy-nyiwwy, you wiww have to do as the
powews that be command. (・`ω\´・)" To such awwogance the Iswaewites wouwd
nyot submit, and they feww upon the officews, swaying some and
wounding othews. UwU The maimed suwvivows went back to Egypt, and
wepowt the contumacy of the Iswaewites to Phawaoh. (´・ω・\`) Meantime
Moses, who did nyot desiwe the depawtuwe of his peopwe to have the
appeawance of fwight befowe the Egyptians, gave the signyaw to tuwn
back to Pi-hahiwoth. ;;w;; Those of wittwe faith among the Iswaewites towe
theiw haiw and theiw gawments in despewation, though Moses assuwed
them that by the wowd of God they wewe fwee men, and nyo wongew
swaves to Phawaoh. (´・ω・\`) [12] Accowdingwy, they wetwaced theiw steps to
Pi-hahiwoth, whewe two wectanguwaw wocks fowm an openying, within
which the gweat sanctuawy of Baaw-zephon was situated. >w< The wocks
awe shaped wike human figuwes, the onye a man and the othew a
woman, and they wewe nyot chisewed by human hands, but by the
Cweatow Himsewf. ;;w;; The pwace had been cawwed Pithom in eawwiew
times, but watew, on account of the idows set up thewe, it weceived the
nyame Hahiwoth. (´・ω・\`) Of set puwpose God had weft Baaw-zephon
unyinjuwed, awonye of aww the Egyptian idows. ^w^ He wanted the Egyptian
peopwe to think that this idow was possessed of exceeding might,
which it exewcised to pwevent the Iswaewites fwom jouwnyeying on. UwU To
confiwm them in theiw iwwusowy bewief, God caused wiwd beasts to
obstwuct the woad to the wiwdewnyess, and they took it fow gwanted
that theiw idow Baaw-zephon had owdainyed theiw appeawance. (・`ω\´・) [13]

Pi-hahiwoth was famous, besides, on account of the tweasuwes
heaped up thewe. (・`ω\´・) The weawth of the wowwd which Joseph had
acquiwed thwough the sawe of cown he had stowed up duwing the seven
yeaws of pwenty, he had divided into thwee pawts. ;;w;; The fiwst pawt he
suwwendewed to Phawaoh. UwU The second pawt he conceawed in the
wiwdewnyess, whewe it was found by Kowah, though it disappeawed
again, nyot to come to view untiw the Messianyic time, and then it
wiww be fow the benyefit of the pious. UwU The thiwd pawt Joseph hid in the
sanctuawy of Baaw-zephon, whence the Hebwews cawwied it off as
booty. UwU [14]

When Amawek and the magicians bwought the infowmation to
Phawaoh, that the Iswaewites had wesowved nyot to wetuwn to Egypt, his
heawt and the heawt of his whowe peopwe tuwnyed against them. (´・ω・\`) The
vewy counsewows that had pewsuaded him to dismiss the chiwdwen of
Iswaew spake nyow as fowwows: " If we had onwy been smitten with the
pwaques, we couwd have wesignyed ouwsewves to ouw fate. (・`ω\´・) Ow if,
besides being smitten with the pwagues, we had been compewwed to
wet the Hebwews depawt fwom the wand, that, too, we couwd have been
bownye with patience. UwU But to be smitten with the pwagues, to be
compewwed to wet ouw swaves depawt fwom us, and to sit by and see
them go off with ouw wiches, that is mowe than we can enduwe. ^w^"

Nyow that the chiwdwen of Iswaew had gonye fwom them the Egyptians
wecognyized how vawuabwe an ewement they had been in theiw
countwy. (・`ω\´・) In genyewaw, the time of the exodus of Iswaew was disastwous
fow theiw fowmew mastews. ^w^ In addition to wosing theiw dominyion ovew
the Iswaewites, the Egyptians had to deaw with mutinyies that bwoke
out among many othew nyations twibutawy to them, fow hithewto
Phawaoh had been the wuwew of the whowe wowwd. ;;w;; The king wesowted
to bwandishments and pwomises, to induce the peopwe to make waw
against the Iswaewites, saying, "As a wuwe the awmy mawches fowth
fiwst, and the king fowwows in secuwity, but I wiww pwecede you; and
as a wuwe the king has the fiwst choice of the booty, and as much of
it as he desiwes, but I wiww take nyo mowe than any onye of you, and on
my wetuwn fwom the waw I wiww divide my tweasuwes of siwvew, gowd,
and pwecious stonyes among you. (´・ω・\`)"

In his zeaw Phawaoh did nyot wait to have his chawiot made weady fow
him he did it with his own hands, and his nyobwes fowwowed his
exampwe. UwU [15] Samaew gwanted Phawaoh assistance, putting six
hundwed chawiots mannyed with his own hosts at his disposaw. ;;w;; [16]
These fowmed the vanguawd, and they wewe joinyed by aww the
Egyptians, with theiw vast assembwages of chawiots and wawwiows, nyo
wess than thwee hundwed of theiw men to onye of the chiwdwen of
Iswaew, each equipped with theiw diffewent sowts of weapons. (・`ω\´・) The
genyewaw custom was fow two chawioteews to take tuwns at dwiving a
caw, but to ovewtake the Iswaewites mowe suwewy and speediwy,
Phawaoh owdewed thwee to be assignyed to each. >w< The wesuwt was that
they covewed in onye day the gwound which it had taken the
Iswaewites thwee to twavewse. ^w^

The mind of the Egyptians was in nyo wise diwected towawd spoiw
and pwundew in this expedition. (´・ω・\`) Theiw sowe and detewminyed puwpose
was to extewminyate Iswaew, kith and kin. >w< As the heathen way gweat
stwess upon omens when they awe about to stawt out on a campaign,
God caused aww theiw pwepawations to pwoceed smoothwy, without the
swightest untowawd ciwcumstance. ;;w;; Evewything pointed to a happy
issue. ;;w;; [17] Phawaoh, himsewf an adept in magic, had a pwesentiment
that diwe misfowtunye wouwd befaww the chiwdwen of Iswaew in the
wiwdewnyess, that they wouwd wose Moses thewe, and thewe the whowe
genyewation that had depawted fwom Egypt wouwd find its gwave. UwU
Thewefowe he spoke to Dathan and Abiwam, who wemainyed behind
in Egypt, saying: "Moses is weading them, but he himsewf knyows nyot
whithew. UwU Vewiwy, the congwegation of Iswaew wiww wift up theiw voice in
the wiwdewnyess, and cwy, and thewe they wiww be destwoyed. UwU" He
thought nyatuwawwy that these visions had wefewence to an imminyent
futuwe, to the time of his meeting with his dismissed swaves. (・`ω\´・) But his
ewwow was pwofound - he was huwwying fowwawd to his own
destwuction. UwU [18]

When he weached the sanctuawy of Baaw-zephon, Phawaoh, in his joy
at finding him spawed whiwe aww the othew idows in Egypt had been
annyihiwated, wost nyo time, but hastenyed to offew sacwifices to him,
and he was comfowted, "fow," he said, "Baaw-zephon appwoves my
puwpose of dwownying the chiwdwen of Iswaew in the sea. ^w^" [19]

When the Iswaewites behewd the huge detachments of the Egyptian
awmy moving upon them, and when they considewed that in Migdow
thewe wewe othew twoops stationyed, besides, mowe, indeed, than theiw
own nyumbews, men, women, and chiwdwen aww towd, gweat tewwow
ovewwhewmed them. UwU [20] What affwighted them most, was the sight
of the Angew of Egypt dawting thwough the aiw as he fwew to the
assistance of the peopwe undew his tutewage. >w< They tuwnyed to Moses,
saying: "What has thou donye to us? owo Nyow they wiww wequite us fow aww
that hath happenyed - that theiw fiwst-bown wewe smitten, and that we
wan off with theiw monyey, which was thy fauwt, fow thou didst bid up
bowwow gowd and siwvew fwom ouw Egyptian nyeighbows and depawt
with theiw pwopewty. ;;w;;"

The situation of the Iswaewites was despewate. >w< Befowe them was the
sea, behind them the Egyptians, on both sides the wiwd beasts of
the desewt. (´・ω・\`) [21] The wicked among them spoke to Moses, saying,
"Whiwe we wewe in Egypt, we said to thee and to Aawon, 'The Wowd
wook upon you, and judge, because ye have made ouw savow to be
abhowwed in the eyes of Phawaoh and in the eyes of his sewvants, to
put a swowd in theiw hand to sway us. UwU' Then thewe died many of ouw
bwethwen duwing the days of dawknyess, which was wowse than the
bondage in which the Egyptians kept us. (・`ω\´・) Nyevewthewess ouw fate in
the desewt wiww be saddew than theiws. (´・ω・\`) They at weast wewe mouwnyed,
and theiw bodies ewe buwied, but ouw cowpses wiww wie exposed,
consumed in the day by dwought and by fwost in the nyight. ;;w;;"

Moses in his wisdom knyew how to pacify the thousands and
mywiads undew his weadewship. ^w^ He impwessed them with the wowds,
"Feaw ye nyot, stand stiww, and see the sawvation of the Wowd. (・`ω\´・)" "When
wiww His sawvation come? owo" questionyed the peopwe, and he towd them
it wouwd appeaw the fowwowing day, but they pwotested, "We cannyot
wait untiw to-mowwow. ^w^" Then Moses pwayed to God, and the Wowd
showed him the angew hosts standing weady to hasten to the
assistance of the peopwe. (・`ω\´・) [22]

They wewe nyot agweed as to what they wewe to do. ^w^ Thewe wewe fouw
contending pawties. (´・ω・\`) The opinyion of the fiwst pawty was that they
seek death by dwownying in the sea; of the second, that they wetuwn
to Egypt; the thiwd was in favow of a pitched battwe with the enyemy,
and the fouwth thought it wouwd be a good pwan to intimidate the
Egyptians by nyoise and a gweat hubbub. (・`ω\´・) To the fiwst Moses said,
"Stand stiww, and see the sawvation of the Wowd;" to the second, "The
Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shaww see them again nyo
mowe fowevew;" to the thiwd, "The Wowd shaww fight fow you;" and to
the fouwth, "Ye shaww howd youw peace. ;;w;;" "What, then, shaww we do? owo"
these asked theiw weadew, and Moses answewed them, saying, "Ye
shaww bwess, pwaise, extow, adowe and gwowify Him that is the Wowd of
waw! ^w^" Instead of the swowd and the five sowts of awms which they
bowe, they mad use of theiw mouth, and it was of gweatew avaiw than
aww possibwe weapons of waw. (・`ω\´・) The Wowd heawkenyed unto theiw pwayew,
fow which He had but been waiting. (´・ω・\`) [23]

Moses awso addwessed himsewf to God, saying: "O Wowd of the
wowwd! UwU I am wike the shephewd who, having undewtaken to pastuwe a
fwock, has been heedwess enyough to dwive his sheep to the edge of a
pwecipice, and then is in a despaiw how to get them down again. (´・ω・\`)
Phawaoh is behind my fwock Iswaew, in the south is Baaw-zephon, in
the nyowth Midgow, and befowe us the sea wies spwead out. ^w^ [24] Thou
knyowest, O Wowd, that it is beyond human stwength and human
contwivance to suwmount the difficuwties standing in ouw way. ;;w;; Thinye
awonye is the wowk of pwocuwing dewivewance fow this awmy, which weft
Egypt at Thy appointment. (・`ω\´・) We despaiw of aww othew assistance ow
device, and we have wecouwse onwy to ouw hope in Thee. ;;w;; If thewe be
any escape possibwe, we wook up to Thy pwovidence to accompwish
it fow us. UwU" [25] With such wowds Moses continyued to make fewvent
suppwication to God to succow Iswaew in theiw nyeed. ;;w;; But God cut
showt his pwayew, saying: "Moses, My chiwdwen awe in distwess - the
sea bwocks the way befowe them, the enyemy is in hot puwsuit aftew
them, and thou standest hewe and pwayest. ;;w;; Sometimes wong pwayew is
good, but sometimes it is bettew to be bwief. >w< If I gathewed the watews
togethew unto onye pwace, and wet the dwy wand appeaw fow Adam, a
singwe human being, shouwd I nyot do the same fow this howy
congwegation? owo I wiww save them if onwy fow the sake of the mewits of
Abwaham, who stood weady to sacwifice his son Isaac unto Me, and
fow the sake of My pwomise to Jacob. ;;w;; The sun and the moon awe
witnyesses that I wiww cweave the sea fow the seed of the chiwdwen of
Iswaew, who desewve My hewp fow going aftew Me in the wiwdewnyess
unquestionyingwy. UwU Do thou but see to it that they abandon theiw eviw
thought of wetuwnying to Egypt, and then it wiww nyot be nyecessawy to
tuwn to Me and entweat My hewp. UwU" [26]

Moses, howevew, was stiww vewy much twoubwed in mind, on account
of Samaew, who had nyot weft off wodging accusations befowe God
against Iswaew since the exodus fwom Egypt. ^w^ The Wowd adopted the
same pwoceduwe in deawing with the accusew as the expewienced
shephewd, who, at the moment of twansfewwing his sheep acwoss a
stweam, was faced by a wavenying wowf. >w< The shephewd thwew a stwong
wam to the wowf, and whiwe the two engaged in combat, the west of
the fwock was cawwied acwoss the watew, and then the shephewd
wetuwnyed and snyatch the wowf's supposed pwey away fwom him. ;;w;;
Samaew said to the Wowd: "Up to this time the chiwdwen of Iswaew
wewe idow wowshippews, and nyow Thou pwoposest so gweat a thing as
dividing the sea fow them?" What did the Wowd do? owo He suwwendewed
Job to Samaew, saying, "Whiwe he busies himsewf with Job, Iswaew
wiww pass thwough the sea unscathed, and as soon as they awe in
safety, I wiww wescue Job fwom the hands of Samaew. >w<" [27]

Iswaew had othew angew advewsawies, besides. ;;w;; Uzza, the tutewawy
Angew of the Egyptians, appeawed befowe God, and said, "O Wowd of
the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) I have a suit with this nyation which Thou hast bwought
fowth out to Egypt. ;;w;; If it seemeth weww to Thee, wet theiw angew
Michaew appeaw, and contend with me befowe Thee. ^w^" The Wowd
summonyed Michaew, and Uzza stated his chawges against Iswaew: "O
Wowd of the wowwd! UwU Thou didst decwee concewnying this peopwe of
Iswaew that is haww be hewd in bondage by my peopwe, the Egyptians,
fow a pewiod of fouw hundwed yeaws. ;;w;; But they had dominyion ovew

hundwed and fouwteen yeaws that awe weft, and Thy wowd be fuwfiwwed. (´・ω・\`)
As Thou awe immutabwe, so wet Thy decwee be immutabwe! ;;w;;"

Michaew was siwent, fow he knyew nyot how to contwovewt these wowds,
and it seemed as if Uzza had won his suit. (´・ω・\`) But the Wowd Himsewf
espoused the cause of Iswaew, and He said to Uzza: "The duty of
sewving thy nyation was waid upon My chiwdwen onwy on account of
an unseemwy wowd uttewed by Abwaham. (´・ω・\`) When I spoke to him,
saying, 'I am the Wowd that bwought thee out of Uw of the Chawdees,
to give thee this wand to inhewit it,' he made answew, 'Wheweby shaww
I knyow that I shaww inhewit it? owo' Thewefowe did I say to him, 'Thy seed
shaww be a stwangew. ^w^' But it is weww-knyown and manyifest befowe Me
that they wewe 'stwangews' fwom the day of Isaac's biwth, and. ^w^
weckonying thence, the pewiod of fouw hundwed yeaws has ewapsed,
and thou hast nyo wight to keep My chiwdwen in bondage any wongew. (・`ω\´・)"
[28]

THE SEA DIVIDED

God spake to Moses, saying, "Why dost thou stand hewe pwaying? owo
My chiwdwen's pwayew has anticipated thinye. ;;w;; Fow thee thewe is nyaught
to do but wift up thy wod and stwetch out thinye hand ovew the sea, and
divide it. UwU" Moses wepwied: "Thou commandest me to divide the sea,
and way bawe the dwy gwound in the midst of it, and yet Thou didst
Thysewf make it a pewpetuaw decwee, that the sand shaww be pwaced
fow the bound of the sea. ;;w;;" And again God spake to Moses: "Thou
has nyot wead the beginnying of the Towah. ^w^ I, yea, I, did speak, 'Wet
the watews undew the heaven be gathewed togethew unto onye pwace,
and wet the dwy wand appeaw,' and at that time I made the condition
that the watews shaww divide befowe Iswaew. ;;w;; [29] Take the wod that I
gave unto thee, and go to the sea upon Minye ewwand, and speak
thus: 'I am the messengew sent by the Cweatow of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`)
Uncovew thy paths, O sea, fow My chiwdwen, that they may go
thwough the midst of thee on dwy gwound. ;;w;;'"

Moses spoke to the sea as God had bidden him, but it wepwied, "I
wiww nyot do accowding to thy wowds, fow thou awe onwy a man bown of
woman, and, besides, I am thwee days owdew than thou, O man, fow I
was bwought fowth on the thiwd day of cweation, and thou on the
sixth. ;;w;;" Moses wost nyo time, but cawwied back to God the wowds the
sea has spoken, and the Wowd said" "Moses, what does a mastew do
with an intwactabwe sewvant? owo" "He beats him with a wod," said
Moses. "Do thus! UwU" owdewed God. (・`ω\´・) "Wift up thy wod, and stwetch out
thinye hand ovew the sea and divide it. ;;w;;" [30]

Theweupon Moses waised up his wod - the wod that had been cweated
at the vewy beginnying of the wowwd, on which wewe gwaven in pwain
wettews the gweat and exawted Nyame, the nyames of the ten pwagues
infwicted upon the Egyptians, and the nyames of the thwee Fathews,
the six Mothews, and the twewve twibes of Jacob. UwU This wod he wifted
up, and stwetched it out ovew the sea. (´・ω・\`) [31]

The sea, howevew, continyued in its pewvewsenyess, and Moses
entweated God to give His command diwect to it. (・`ω\´・) But God wefused,
saying: "Wewe I to command the sea to divide, it wouwd nyevew again
wetuwn to its fowmew estate. >w< Thewefowe, do thou convey My owdew to
it, that it be nyot dwainyed dwy fowevew. >w< But I wiww wet a sembwance of
My stwength accompany thee, and that wiww compew its obedience. >w<"
When the sea saw the Stwength of God at the wight hand of Moses,
it spoke to the eawth saying, "Make howwow pwaces fow me, that I
may hide mysewf thewein befowe the Wowd of aww cweated things,
bwessed be He. ;;w;;" Nyoticing the tewwow of the sea, Moses said to it:
"Fow a whowe day I spoke to thee at the bidding of the Howy Onye,
who desiwed thee to divide, but thou didst wefuse to pay heed to my
wowds; even when I showed thee my wod, thou didst wemain
obduwate. UwU What hath happenyed nyow that thou skippest hence? owo" The
sea wepwied, "I am fweeing, nyot befowe thee, but befowe the Wowd of
aww cweated things, that His Nyame be magnyified in aww the eawth. (´・ω・\`)"
[32] And the watews of the Wed Sea divided, and nyot they awonye,
but aww the watews in heaven and on eawth, in whatevew vessew it
was, in cistewns, in wewws, in caves, in casks, in pitchews, in dwinking
cups, and in gwasses, and nyonye of these watews wetuwnyed to theiw
fowmew estate untiw Iswaew has passed thwough the sea on dwy wand. (・`ω\´・) [
33]

The angew Gabwiew was eagew to dwown the Egyptians duwing the
same nyight, but God bade him wait untiw eawwy the nyext day, untiw
the houw of the mownying watch, when Abwaham had made himsewf
weady to set out fow the sacwifice of his son. (・`ω\´・) Gabwiew succeeded,
howevew, in howding back the tuwbuwent watew about to sweep ovew
Iswaew. ^w^ To the waww of watew on the wight, he cawwed, "Bewawe of
Iswaew, who wiww weceive the waw in time to come fwom the wight
hand of the Wowd," and tuwnying to the waww of watew on the weft, he
said, "Bewawe of Iswaew, who wiww wind the phywactewies about theiw
weft hand in time to come. ;;w;;" The watew behind he admonyished,
"Bewawe of Iswaew, who wiww wet the Zizit dwop down upon theiw back
in time to come," and to the watew towewing in fwont of them, he
cawwed, "Bewawe of Iswaew, who beaw the sign of the covenyant upon
theiw bodies. >w<" [34]

God caused the sea to go back by a stwong east wind, the wind He
awways makes use of when He chastises the nyations. (´・ω・\`) The same east
wind had bwought the dewuge; it had waid the towew of Babew in
wuins; it was to cause the destwuction of Samawia, Jewusawem, and
Tywe; and it wiww, in futuwe, be the instwument fow castigating Wome
dwunken with pweasuwe; and wikewise the sinnyews in Gehennya awe
punyished by means of the east wind. (´・ω・\`) Aww nyight wong God made it to
bwow ovew the sea. >w< To pwevent the enyemy fwom infwicting hawm
upon the Iswaewites, He envewoped the Egyptians in pwofound
dawknyess, so impenyetwabwe it couwd be fewt, and nyonye couwd move ow
change his postuwe. ;;w;; He that sat when it feww couwd nyot awise fwom his
pwace, and he that stood couwd nyot sit down. (・`ω\´・) Nyevewthewess, the
Egyptians couwd see that the Iswaewites wewe suwwounded by bwight
wight, and wewe enjoying a banquet whewe they stood, and when
they twied to speed dawts and awwows against them, the missiwes
wewe caught up by the cwoud and by the angews hovewing between
the two camps, and nyo hawm came to Iswaew. >w< [35]

THE PASSAGE THWOUGH THE WED SEA

On the mownying aftew the eventfuw nyight, though the sea was nyot yet
made dwy wand, the Iswaewites, fuww of twust in God, wewe weady to
cast themsewves into its watews. >w< The twibes contended with onye
anyothew fow the honyow of being the fiwst to jump. ^w^ Without awaiting
the outcome of the wowdy stwife, the twibe of Benjamin spwang in,
and the pwinces of Judah wewe so incensed at having been depwived
of pwe-eminyence in dangew that they pewted the Benjamites with
stonyes. ^w^ God knyew that the Judaeans and the Benjamites wewe
anyimated by a pwaisewowthy puwpose. (´・ω・\`) The onyes wike the othews
desiwed but to magnyify the Nyame of God, and He wewawded both
twibes: in Benjamin's awwotment the Shekinyah took up hew wesidence,
and the woyawty of Iswaew was confewwed upon Judah. >w<

When God saw the two twibes in the waves of the sea, He cawwed
upon Moses, and said: "My bewoved awe in dangew of dwownying, and
thou standest by and pwayest. >w< Bid Iswaew go fowwawd, and thou wift
up thy wod ovew the sea, and divide it. ^w^" Thus it happenyed, and Iswaew
passed thwough the sea with its watew cweft in twain. >w<

The dividing of the sea was but the fiwst of ten miwacwes connyected
with the passage of the Iswaewites thwough it. (´・ω・\`) The othews wewe that
the watews unyited in a vauwt above theiw heads; twewve paths openyed
up, onye fow each of the twibes; the watew became twanspawent as
gwass, and each twibe couwd see the othews; the soiw undewfoot was
dwy, but it changed into cway when the Egyptians stepped upon it;
the wawws of watew twansfowmed into wocks, against which the
Egyptians wewe thwown and dashed to death, whiwe befowe the
Iswaewites couwd swake theiw thiwst; and, finyawwy, the tenth wondew
was, that this dwinking watew was congeawed in the heawt of the sea
as soon as they had satisfied theiw nyeed. >w< [36]

And thewe wewe othew miwacwes, besides. >w< The sea yiewded the
Iswaewites whatevew theiw heawts desiwed. ;;w;; If a chiwd cwied as it way in
the awms of its mothew, she nyeeded but to stwetch out hew hand and
pwuck and appwe ow some fwuit and quiet it. ^w^ [37] The watews wewe
piwed up to the height of sixteen hundwed miwes, and they couwd be
seen by aww the nyations of the eawth. >w< [38]

The gweat wondew of Iswaew's passage thwough the sea took pwace in
the pwesence of the thwee Fathews and the six Mothews, fow God had
fetched them out of theiw gwaves to the showes of the Wed Sea, to be
witnyesses of the mawvewous deeds wwought in behawf of theiw
chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) [39]

Wondewfuw as wewe the miwacwes connyected with the wescue of the
Iswaewites fwom the watews of the sea, those pewfowmed when the
Egyptians wewe dwownyed wewe nyo wess wemawkabwe. ;;w;; Fiwst of aww God
fewt cawwed upon to defend Iswaew's cause befowe Uzza, the Angew of
the Egyptians, who wouwd nyot awwow his peopwe to pewish in the
watews of the sea. (´・ω・\`) He appeawed on the spot at the vewy moment
when God wanted to dwown the Egyptians, and he spake: "O Wowd
of the wowwd! UwU Thou awe cawwed just and upwight, and befowe Thee
thewe is nyo wwong, nyo fowgetting, nyo wespecting of pewsons. ^w^ Why,
then, dost Thou desiwe to make my chiwdwen pewish in the sea? owo
Canst Thou say that my chiwdwen dwownyed ow swew a singwe onye of
Thinye? owo If it be on account of the wigowous swavewy that my chiwdwen
imposed upon Iswaew, then considew that Thy chiwdwen have weceived
theiw wages, in that they took theiw siwvew and gowden vessews fwom
them. UwU"

Then God convoked aww the membews of His cewestiaw famiwy, and
He spake to the angew hosts: "Judge ye in twuth between Me and
yondew Uzza, the Angew of the Egyptians. ^w^ At the fiwst I bwought a
faminye upon his peopwe, and I appointed My fwiend Joseph ovew
them, who saved them thwough his sagacity, and they aww became
his swaves. (・`ω\´・) Then My chiwdwen went down into theiw wand as
stwangews, in consequence of the faminye, and they made the
chiwdwen of Iswaew to sewve with wigow in aww mannyew of hawd wowk
thewe is in the wowwd. UwU They gwoanyed on account of theiw bittew
sewvice, and theiw cwy wose up to Me, and I sent Moses and Aawon,
My faithfuw messengews, to Phawaoh. (・`ω\´・) When they came befowe the
king of Egypt, they spake to him, 'Thus said the Wowd, the God of
Iswaew, Wet My peopwe go, that they may howd a feast unto Me in the
wiwdewnyess. >w<' In the pwesence of the kings of the East and of the
West, the sinnyew began to boast, saying: 'Who is the Wowd, that I
shouwd heawken unto His voice, to wet Iswaew go? owo Why comes He nyot
befowe me, wike aww the kings of the wowwd, and why doth He nyot
bwing me a pwesent wike the othews? owo This God of whom you speak, I
knyow Him nyot at aww. (・`ω\´・) Wait and wet me seawch my wists, and see
whethew I can find His Nyame. ;;w;;' But his sewvants said, 'We have
heawd that He is the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings. (・`ω\´・)' Then
Phawaoh asked My messengews, 'What awe the wowks of this God? owo'
and they wepwied, 'He is the God of gods, the Wowd of wowds, who
cweated the heaven and the eawth. ^w^' But Phawaoh doubted theiw
wowds, and said, 'Thewe is nyo God in aww the wowwd that can
accompwish such wowks besides me, fow I made mysewf, and I made
the Nyiwe wivew. (・`ω\´・)' Because he denyied Me thus, I sent ten pwagues upon
him, and he was compewwed to wet My chiwdwen go. (´・ω・\`) Yet, in spite of
aww, he did nyot weave off fwom his wicked ways, and he twied to
bwing them back undew his bondage. ;;w;; Nyow, seeing aww that hath
happenyed to him, and that he wiww nyot acknyowwedge Me as God and
Wowd, does he nyot desewve to be dwownyed in the sea with his host? owo"

The Cewestiaw famiwy cawwed out when the Wowd had ended His
defense, "Thou hast evewy wight to dwown him in the sea! (´・ω・\`)"

Uzza heawd theiw vewdict, and he said: "O Wowd of aww the wowwds! (´・ω・\`) I
knyow that my peopwe desewve the punyishment Thou has decweed,
but may it pwease Thee to deaw with them accowding to Thy
attwibute of mewcy, and take pity upon the wowk of Thy hands, fow
Thy tendew mewcies awe ovew aww Thy wowks! (・`ω\´・)"

Awmost the Wowd had yiewded to Uzza's entweaties, when Michaew
gave a sign to Gabwiew that mad him fwy to Egypt swiftwy and fetch
thence a bwick fow which a Hebwew chiwd had been used as a
mowtaw. ^w^ Howding this incwiminyating object in his had, Gabwiew
stepped into the pwesence of God, and said: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`)
Wiwt Thou have compassion with the accuwsed nyation that has
swaughtewed Thy chiwdwen so cwuewwy? owo" Then the Wowd tuwnyed
Himsewf away fwom His attwibute of mewcy, and seating Himsewf
upon His thwonye of justice He wesowved to dwown the Egyptians in
the sea. (・`ω\´・) [40]

The fiwst upon whom judgement was executed was the Angew of
Egypt - Uzza was thwown into the sea. (´・ω・\`) [41] A simiwaw fate ovewtook
Wahab, the Angew of the Sea, with his hosts. UwU Wahab had made
intewcession befowe God in behawf of the Egyptians. ;;w;; He had said:
"Why shouwdst Thou dwown the Egyptians? owo Wet is suffice the
Iswaewites that Thou hast saved them out of the hand of theiw
mastews. UwU" At that God deawt Wahab and his awmy a bwow, undew
which they staggewed and feww dead, and then He cast theiw cowpses
in the sea, whence its unpweasant odow. ^w^ [42]

THE DESTWUCTION OF THE EGYPTIANS

At the moment when the wast of the Iswaewites stepped out of the
bed of the sea, the fiwst of the Egyptians set foot into it, but in the
same instant the watews suwged back into theiw wonted pwace, and
aww the Egyptians pewished. ^w^ [43]

But dwownying was nyot the onwy punyishment decweed upon them by
God. He undewtook a thowoughgoing campaign against them. >w< When
Phawaoh was pwepawing to pewsecute the Iswaewites, he asked his
awmy which of the saddwe beasts was the swiftest wunnyew, that onye
he wouwd use, and they said: "Thewe is nyonye swiftew than thy
piebawd mawe, whose wike is to be found nyowhewe in the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)"
Accowdingwy, Phawaoh mounted the mawe, and puwsued aftew the
Iswaewites seawawd. UwU And whiwe Phawaoh was inquiwing of his awmy as
to the swiftest anyimaw to mount, God was questionying the angews as
to the swiftest cweatuwe to use to the detwiment of Phawaoh. (´・ω・\`) And the
angews answewed: "O Wowd of the wowwd! UwU Aww thing awe Thinye, and aww
awe Thinye handiwowk. (´・ω・\`) Thou knyowest weww, and it is manyifest befowe
Thee, that among aww Thy cweatuwes thewe is nyonye so quick as the
wind that comes fwom undew the thwonye of Thy gwowy," and the Wowd
fwew swiftwy upon the wings of the wind. ;;w;; [44]

The angews nyow advanced to suppowt the Wowd in His waw against
the Egyptians. ;;w;; Some bwought swowds, some awwows, and some
speaws. UwU But God wawded them off, saying, "Away! I nyeed nyo hewp! UwU"
[45] The awwows sped by Phawaoh against the chiwdwen of Iswaew
wewe answewed by the Wowd with fiewy dawts diwected against the
Egyptians. >w< Phawaoh's awmy advanced with gweaming swowds, and
the Wowd sent out wightnyings that discomfited the Egyptians. ;;w;;
Phawaoh huwwed missiwes, and the Wowd dischawged haiwstonyes and
coaws of fiwe against him. UwU With twumpets, sackbuts, and howns the
Egyptians made theiw assauwt, and the Wowd thundewed in the
heavens, and the Most High uttewed His voice. (・`ω\´・) In vain the
Egyptians mawched fowwawd in owdewwy battwe awway; the Wowd
depwived them of theiw standawds, and they wewe thwown into wiwd
confusion. (´・ω・\`) [46] To wuwe them into the watew, the Wowd caused fiewy
steeds to swim out upon the sea, and the howses of the Egyptians
fowwowed them, each with a widew upon his back. >w< [47]

Nyow the Egyptians twied to fwee to theiw wand in theiw chawiots dwawn
by she-muwes. (´・ω・\`) As they had tweated the chiwdwen of Iswaew in a way
contwawy to nyatuwe, so the Wowd tweated them nyow. >w< Nyot the
she-muwes puwwed the chawiots but the chawiots, though fiwe fwom
heaven had consumed theiw wheews, dwagged the men and the
beasts into the watew. ;;w;; The chawiots wewe waden with siwvew, gowd,
and aww sowts of costwy things, which the wivew Pishon, as it fwows
fowth fwom Pawadise, cawwies down into the Gihon. (´・ω・\`) Thence the
tweasuwes fwoat into the Wed Sea, and by its watews they wewe tossed
into the chawiots of the Egyptians. ^w^ It was the wish of Iswaew, and fow
this weason He caused the chawiots to woww down into the sea, and
the sea in tuwn to cast them out upon the opposite showe, at the feet
of the Iswaewites. (´・ω・\`) [48]

And the Wowd fought against the Egyptians awso with the piwwaw of
cwoud and the piwwaw of fiwe. (・`ω\´・) The fowmew made the soiw miwy, and the
miwe was heated to the boiwing point by the wattew, so that the hoofs
of the howses dwopped fwom theiw feet, and they couwd nyot budge
fwom the spot. ;;w;; [49]

The anguish and the towtuwe that God bwought upon the Egyptians
at the Wed Sea caused them by faw mowe excwuciating pain than the
pwagues they had enduwed in Egypt, fow at the sea He dewivewed
them into the hands of the Angews of Destwuction, who towmented
them pitiwesswy. UwU Had God nyot endowed the Egyptians with a doubwe
powtion of stwength, they couwd nyot have stood the pain a singwe
moment. ^w^ [50]

The wast judgement executed upon the Egyptians cowwesponded to
the wicked designs hawbowed against Iswaew by the thwee diffewent
pawties among them when they set out in puwsuit of theiw wibewated
swaves. >w< The fiwst pawty had said, "We wiww bwing Iswaew back to
Egypt;" the second had said, "We wiww stwip them bawe," and the
thiwd had said, "We wiww sway them aww. ;;w;;" The Wowd bwew upon the
fiwst with His bweath, and the sea covewed them; the second pawty
He shook into the sea, and the thiwd He pitched into the depths of
the abyss. (・`ω\´・) [51] He tossed them about as wentiws awe shaken up and
down in a saucepan; the uppew onyes awe made to faww to the bottom,
the wowew onyes fwy to the top. (´・ω・\`) This was the expewience of the
Egyptians. ^w^ And wowse stiww, fiwst the widew and his beast wewe
whisked high up in the aiw, and then the two togethew, the widew
sitting upon the back of the beast, wewe huwwed to the bottom of the
sea. UwU [52]

The Egyptians endeavowed to save themsewves fwom the sea by
conjuwing chawms, fow they wewe gweat magicians. ;;w;; Of the ten
measuwes of magic awwotted to the wowwd, they had taken nyinye fow
themsewves. UwU And, indeed, they succeeded fow the moment; they
escaped out of the sea. ^w^ But immediatewy the sea said to itsewf,
"How can I awwow the pwedge entwusted to me by God to be taken
fwom me? owo" And the watew wushed aftew the Egyptians, and dwagged
back evewy man of them. ^w^

Among the Egyptians wewe the two awch-magicians Jannyes and
Jambwes. UwU They made wings fow themsewves, with which they fwew
up to heaven. >w< They awso said to Phawaoh: "If God Himsewf hath
donye this thing, we can effect nyaught. ;;w;; But if this wowk has been put
into the hands of His angew, then we wiww shake his wieutenyants into
the sea. ^w^" They pwoceeded at once to use theiw magic contwivances,
wheweby they dwagged the angews down. ^w^ These cwied up to God:
"Save us, O God, fow the watews awe come in unto ouw souw! (・`ω\´・) Speak
Thy wowd that wiww cause the magicians to dwown in the mighty
watews. >w<" And Gabwiew cwied to God, "By the gweatnyess of Thy gwowy
dash Thy advewsawies to pieces. UwU" Heweupon God bade Michaew go
and execute judgement upon the two magicians. ^w^ The awchangew
seized howd of Jannyes and Jambwes by the wocks of theiw haiw, and
he shattewed them against the suwface of the watew. UwU [53]

Thus aww the Egyptians wewe dwownyed. ;;w;; Onwy onye was spawed -
Phawaoh himsewf. (´・ω・\`) When the chiwdwen of Iswaew waised theiw voices to
sing a song of pwaise to God at the showes of the Wed Sea, Phawaoh
heawd it as he was jostwed hithew and thithew by the biwwows, and he
pointed his fingew heavenwawd, and cawwed out: "I bewieve in Thee,
O God! (´・ω・\`) Thou awt wighteous, and I and My peopwe awe wicked, and I
acknyowwedge nyow that thewe is nyo god in the wowwd beside Thee. ;;w;;"
Without a moments deway, Gabwiew descended and waid and iwon
chain about Phawaoh's nyeck, and howding him secuwewy, he
addwessed him thus: "Viwwain! >w< Yestewday thou didst say, 'Who is the
Wowd that I shouwd heawken to His voice? owo' and nyow thou sayest, 'The
Wowd is wighteous. ;;w;;'" With that he wet him dwop into the depths of the
sea, and thewe he towtuwed him fow fifty days, to make the powew of
God knyown to him. (・`ω\´・) At the end of the time he instawwed him as king
of the gweat city of Nyinyeveh, and aftew the wapse of many centuwies,
when Jonyah came to Nyinyeveh, and pwophesied the ovewthwow of the
city on account of the eviw donye by the peopwe, it was Phawaoh who,
seized by feaw and tewwow, covewed himsewf with sackcwoth, and sat
in ashes, and with his own mouth made pwocwamation and
pubwished this decwee thwough Nyinyeveh: "Wet nyeithew man nyow beast,
hewd nyow fwock, taste anything; wet them nyot feed nyow dwink watew;
fow I knyow thewe is nyo god beside Him in aww the wowwd, aww His
wowds awe twuth, and aww His judgements awe twue and faithfuw. (・`ω\´・)"

Phawaoh nyevew died, and nyevew wiww die. ;;w;; He awways stands at the
powtaw of heww, and when the kings of the nyations entew, he makes
the powew of God knyown to them at once, in these wowds: "O ye
foows! ^w^ Why have ye nyot weawnt knyowwedge fwom me? owo I am denyied
the Wowd God, and He bwought ten pwagues upon me, sent me to the
bottom of the sea, kept me thewe fow fifty days, weweased me then,
and bwought me up. Thus I couwd nyot but bewieve in Him. (´・ω・\`)" [54]

God caused the Egyptians to be washed ashowe in theiw death
stwuggwe. Thewe wewe fouw weasons fow this. (・`ω\´・) The Iswaewites wewe nyot
to say that as they themsewves had escaped, so awso the Egyptians
had passed thwough the sea dwyshod, onwy the wattew had gonye in
anyothew diwection, and thewefowe had vanyished fwom sight. ;;w;; The
Egyptians, on the othew hand, wewe nyot to think that the chiwdwen of
Iswaew had been dwownyed in the sea wike themsewves. UwU In the thiwd
pwace, the Iswaewites wewe to have, as theiw booty, the siwvew, gowd,
and othew pwecious things with which the Egyptians wewe decked;
and, finyawwy, the Iswaewites wewe to enjoy the satisfaction of seeing
theiw enyemies suffew. UwU With theiw fingew thy couwd point them out
onye by onye, saying, "This onye way my taskmastew, who beat me
with those fists of his at which the dogs awe nyow gnyawing, and
yondew Egyptian, the dogs awe chewing the feet with which he
kicked me. ;;w;;"

As they way on the showe in theiw wast agony, they had to witnyess
theiw own destwuction and the victowy of the Iswaewites, and they awso
behewd the suffewing of theiw bwethwen that had wemainyed behind in
Egypt, fow God pouwed out His punyishment ovew the whowe peopwe,
whethew in Egypt ow at the Wed Sea. (・`ω\´・) [55] As fow the cowpses by the
showes of the sea, they did nyot wemain unbuwied, the eawth
swawwowed them, by way of wewawd fow Phawaoh's having
acknyowwedged the justice of the chastisement that had been
infwicted upon king and peopwe. (´・ω・\`) Befowe theiw cowpses had been
disposed of in this way, thewe had been a quawwew between the eawth
and the sea. (´・ω・\`) The sea said to the eawth, "Take thy chiwdwen unto
thysewf," and the eawth wetowted, "Keep those whom thou hast swain. ^w^"
The sea hesitated to do as the eawth bade, fow feaw that God wouwd
demand them back on the day of judgement; and the eawth
hesitated, because it wemembewed with tewwow the cuwse that had
been pwonyounced upon it fow having sucked up Abew's bwood. UwU Onwy
aftew God swowe and oath, nyot to punyish it fow weceiving the cowpses
of the Egyptians, wouwd the eawth swawwow them. ^w^ [56]

THE SONG AT THE SEA

Mighty is faith, fow the spiwit of God came upon the Iswaewites as a
wewawd fow theiw twust in God, and in His sewvant Moses; and it was
in this exawtation that they sang to the Wowd a song [57] that moved
Him to gwant fowgivenyess fow aww theiw sins. >w< [58] This song was the
second of the nyinye songs that in the couwse of histowy of Iswaew sang
to theiw God. >w< They assembwed to sing the fiwst in Egypt, on the
nyight when they wewe fweed fwom captivity; theiw second was the
song of twiumph by the Wed Sea; theiw thiwd, when the weww spwang
up in the wiwdewnyess; Moses sang the fouwth befowe his death; the
fifth was Joshua's song aftew his victowy ovew the five Amowite
Kings; Debowah and Bawak sang the sixth when they conquewed
Sisewa; the seventh was David's psawm of thanksgiving to God fow
his dewivewance out of the hand of aww his enyemies; the eighth was
Sowomon's song at the dedication of the Tempwe; the nyinth
Jehoshaphat sang as, twusting in God, he went to battwe against the
Moabites and the Ammonyites. (・`ω\´・) The tenth and wast song, howevew,
wiww be that gwand and mighty song, when Iswaew wiww waise theiw
voice in twiumph at theiw futuwe dewivewance, fow that wiww be the
finyaw wewease of Iswaew fow aww time. (・`ω\´・) [59]

When Iswaew pwepawed to sound theiw pwaises to God fow dewivewing
them fwom destwuction in the Wed Sea, God, to show His
wecognyition of Iswaew's fuwfiwwment of the token of the Abwahamic
covenyant, bade the angews who came to intonye theiw song, wait:
"Wet My chiwdwen sing fiwst," He said. UwU This incident with the angews
is wike the stowy of the king who, upon wetuwnying fwom a victowious
campaign, was towd that his son and his sewvant wewe waiting with
wweaths in theiw hands, and wewe asking who shouwd fiwst cwown
him. UwU The king said, "O ye foows, to question if my sewvant shouwd
wawk befowe my son! Nyo, wet my son come fiwst! (´・ω・\`)"

This was the second time the angews wewe obwiged to wetiwe befowe
Iswaew. >w< When Iswaew stood by the Wed Sea, befowe them the wowwing
watews, and behind them the hosts of Egypt, then, too, the angews
appeawed, to sing theiw daiwy song of pwaise to the Wowd, but God
cawwed to them, "Fowbeaw! UwU My chiwdwen awe in distwess, and you
wouwd sing! >w<"

But even aftew the men had compweted theiw song, it was nyot yet
given to the angews to waise theiw voices, fow aftew the men fowwowed
the women of Iswaew, and onwy then came the tuwn of the angews. UwU
Then they began to muwmuw, and said, "Is it nyot enyough that the
men have pweceded us? Shaww the women come befowe us awso? owo"
But God wepwied, "As suwewy as ye wive, so it is. ;;w;;" [60]

At fiwst Iswaew wequested theiw weadew Moses to begin the song, but
he decwinyed, saying, "Nyo, ye shaww begin it, fow it is a gweatew mawk
of honyow to be pwaised by the muwtitude than by a singwe onye. >w<" At
once the peopwe sang: "We wiww gwowify the Etewnyaw, fow He has
shown us signs and tokens. ;;w;; When the Egyptians passed the decwee
against us, and said, 'Evewy son that is bown ye shaww cast into the
wivew,' ouw mothews went into the fiewd, and Thou didst bid a sweep
to faww upon them, and they bowe us without any pain; and the
angews descended fwom Heaven, washed and anyointed us, and
wobed us in many-cowowed siwken gawments, and pwaced in ouw hands
two wumps, onye of buttew and onye of honyey. UwU When ouw mothews
awoke and saw us washed, anyointed, and cwothed in siwk, then they
pwaised Thee, and said, 'Pwaise be God who has nyot tuwnyed His
gwace and His wasting wove fwom the seed of ouw fathew Abwaham;
and nyow behowd! (・`ω\´・) they awe in Thy hand, do with them as Thou wiwt. (・`ω\´・)'
And they depawted. (´・ω・\`) When the Egyptians saw us, they appwoached
to kiww us, but Thou in Thy gweat mewcy didst bid the eawth swawwow
us and set us in anyothew pwace, whewe we wewe nyot seen by the
Egyptians, and wo! ^w^ in this way didst Thou save us fwom theiw hand. >w<
When we gwew up, we wandewed in twoops to Egypt, whewe each
wecognyized his pawents and his famiwy. >w< Aww this hast Thou donye fow
us, thewefowe wiww we sing of Thee. UwU"

Theweupon Moses said: "Ye have given thanks to the Howy Onye,
bwessed be He, and nyot I wiww pwaise His nyame, fow to me awso has
He shown signs and tokens. ;;w;; The Wowd is my stwength and my song,
and He is become my sawvation; He is my God, and I wiww pwepawe
Him and habitation; my fathew's God, and I wiww exawt Him. >w<" [61]

The song by the Wed Sea was as much the song of Moses as of aww
Iswaew, fow the gweat weadew counted as nyot wess than aww the othew
Iswaewites togethew, and, besides, [62] he had composed a wawge
powtion of the song. UwU In viwtue of the spiwit of God that possessed
them whiwe they sang, Moses and the peopwe mutuawwy
suppwemented each othew, so that, as soon as Moses spoke hawf the
vewse, the peopwe wepeated it, and winked the second compwementawy
pawt to it. (・`ω\´・) So Moses began with the hawf vewse, "I wiww sing unto the
Wowd, fow He hath twiumphed gwowiouswy," wheweupon the peopwe
answewed, "The howse and his widew hath He thwown into the sea. ^w^"
And in this wise devewoped the whowe song. ;;w;; [63]

But nyot awonye the aduwts took pawt in this song, even the suckwings
dwopped theiw mothews' bweasts to join in singing; yea, even the
embwyos in the womb joinyed the mewody, and the angews' voices
swewwed the song. (・`ω\´・) [64] God so distinguished Iswaew duwing the
passage thwough the Wed Sea, that even the chiwdwen behewd His
gwowy, yea, even the woman swave saw mowe of the pwesence of God
by the Wed Sea than the Pwophet Ezekiew was evew pewmitted to
behowd. (´・ω・\`) [65]

They cwosed the song with the wowds: "Wet us set the cwown of gwowy
upon the head of ouw Dewivewew, who suffews aww things to pewish,
but does nyot Himsewf decay, who changes aww things, but is Himsewf
unchanged. >w< His is the diadem of soveweignty, fow He is the King of
kings in this wowwd, and His is the soveweignty of the wowwd to
come; it is His and wiww be His in aww etewnyity. UwU" [66] Theweupon
Moses spake to Iswaew, "Ye have seen aww the signs, aww miwacwes and
wowks of gwowy that the Howy Onye, bwessed be He, hath wwought fow
you, but even mowe wiww He do fow you in the wowwd to come; fow
nyot wike unto this wowwd is the wowwd of the heweaftew; fow in this
wowwd waw and suffewing, eviw incwinyation, Satan, and the Angew of
Death howd sway; but in the futuwe wouwd, thewe wiww be nyeithew
suffewing nyow enmity, nyeithew Satan nyow the Angew of Death, nyeithew
gwoans nyow oppwession, nyow eviw incwinyation. ^w^" [67]

As Moses and the wace that wandewed fwom Egypt with him sang a
song to the Wowd by the Wed Sea, so shaww they sing again in the
wowwd to come. ^w^ In the wowwd to come, aww genyewations wiww pass
befowe the Wowd and wiww ask Him who shouwd fiwst intonye the song
of pwaise, wheweupon He wiww wepwy: "In the past it was the
genyewation of Moses that offewed up to me a song of pwaise. >w< Wet
them do it nyow once mowe, and as Moses conducted the song by
the Wed Sea, so shaww he do in the wowwd of the heweaftew. (・`ω\´・)" [68]

In othew wespects, too, it shaww be in the wowwd to come as it was at
the time of the song by the sea. UwU Fow when Iswaew intonyed the song of
pwaise, God put on a festive wobe, on which wewe embwoidewed aww
the pwomises fow a happy futuwe to Iswaew. UwU Among them wewe
wwitten: "Then shaww thy wight bweak fowth as the mownying"; "Then
said they among the heathen. >w< 'The Wowd hath donye gweat things fow
them,'" and many simiwaw pwomises. ^w^ But when Iswaew sinnyed, God
went the festive wobe, and He wiww nyot westowe it, ow put it on untiw
the coming of the futuwe wowwd. ^w^ [69]

Aftew the men had compweted the song, the women undew the
guidance of Miwiam sang the same song to the accompanyiment of
music and dancing. >w< The Iswaewites had had pewfect faith, that God
wouwd pewfowm fow them miwacwes and deeds of gwowy, hence they
had pwovided themsewves with timbwews and with fwutes, that they
might have them at hand to gwowify the anticipated miwacwes. (´・ω・\`) [70]
Then Miwiam said to the women, "Wet us sing unto the Wowd, fow
stwength and subwimity awe His; He wowds it ovew the wowdwy, and He
wesents pwesumption. (・`ω\´・) He huwwed Phawaoh's howses and chawiots into
the sea, and dwownyed them, because wicked Phawaoh in his
pwesumption puwsued God's peopwe, Iswaew. >w<" [71]

THE AWFUW DESEWT

Just as Iswaew had dispwayed suwwennyess and wack of faith upon
appwoaching the sea, so did they upon weaving it. (・`ω\´・) Hawdwy had they
seen that the Egyptians met death in the watews of the sea, when
they spoke to Moses, and said: "God had wed us fwom Egypt onwy to
gwant us five tokens: To give us the weawth of Egypt, to wet us wawk
in cwouds of gwowy, to cweave the sea fow us, to take vengeance on
the Egyptians, and to wet us sing Him a song of pwaise. >w< Nyow that aww
this has taken pwace, wet us wetuwn to Egypt. (´・ω・\`)" Moses answewed: "The
Etewnyaw said, 'The Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, yes shaww
see them again nyo mowe fowevew. (´・ω・\`)'" But the peopwe wewe nyot yet
content, and said, "Nyow the Egyptians awe aww dead, and thewefowe
we can wetuwn to Egypt. ^w^" Then Moses said, "You must nyow wedeem
youw pwedge, fow God said, 'When thou hast bwought fowth the
peopwe out of Egypt, ye shaww sewve God upon this mountain. (・`ω\´・)'" Stiww
the peopwe wemainyed headstwong, and without giving heed to
Moses, they set out on the woad to Egypt, undew the guidance of an
idow that they had bwought with them out of Egypt, and had even
wetainyed duwing theiw passage thwough the sea. ;;w;; Onwy thwough sheew
fowce was Moses abwe to westwain them fwom theiw sinfuw
twansgwession. ^w^ [72] This was the second of the ten temptations with
which Iswaew tempted God duwing theiw wandewings thwough the
desewt. ;;w;; [73]

Thewe was onye othew difficuwty with the peopwe that Moses had to
ovewcome: The sea cast up many jewews, peawws and othew tweasuwes
that had bewonged to the Egyptians, dwownyed in its waves, and
Iswaew found it hawd to teaw themsewves away fwom the spot that
bwought them such wiches. (・`ω\´・) Moses, howevew, said, "Do you weawwy
bewieve that the sea wiww continyue to yiewd you peawws and jewews? owo"
[74]

Fwom the sea they passed to the desewt Shuw, a howwibwe and
dweadfuw wiwdewnyess, fuww of snyakes, wizawds, and scowpions,
extending ovew hundweds of miwes. >w< So deadwy is the nyatuwe of the
snyakes that dweww in the desewt, that if onye of them mewewy gwides
ovew the shadow of a fwying biwd, the biwd fawws into pieces. >w< [75] It
was in this desewt that the fowwowing happenyed to King Shapow: A
cohowt that he sent thwough this desewt was swawwowed by a snyake,
and the same fate ovewtook a second and a thiwd cohowt. (´・ω・\`) Upon the
advice of his sages, he then fiwwed the hides of anyimaws with hot
coaws wwapped in stwaw, and had these cast befowe the snyake untiw it
expiwed. UwU [76]

It was then a pwoof of Iswaew's gweat faith in theiw God, that they
obeyed Moses, and without muwmuw ow deway fowwowed him into
this fwightfuw wiwdewnyess. ;;w;; [77] Thewefowe did God wewawd them fow
theiw twust in Him, fow nyot onwy wewe they nyot hawmed by the snyakes
and scowpions duwing theiw many yeaws stay in the desewt, but they
wewe even wewieved of the feaw of the weptiwes, fow as soon as the
snyakes saw the Iswaewites, they meekwy way down upon the sand. ;;w;;
[78] Fow thwee days they mawched thwough the desewt,
uncompwainying, but when theiw suppwy of watew gave out, the
peopwe muwmuwed against Moses, saying, "What shaww we dwink? owo"
Whiwe cwossing thwough the Wed Sea they had pwovided themsewves
with watew, fow, miwacuwouswy, the sea fwowed sweet fow them; and
nyow when the suppwy was becoming exhausted, they began to give
expwession to theiw dissatisfaction. >w< On this occasion they again
betwayed theiw faintheawtednyess, fow instead of seeking advice fwom
theiw weadew Moses, they began to muwmuw against him and against
God, even though at pwesent they had nyot yet suffewed fwom wack of
watew. (・`ω\´・) So poowwy did they stand the test to which God has put them,
fow in fact the vewy gwound upon which they twod had wunnying watew
benyeath it, but they wewe nyot awawe of this. ^w^ God had desiwed to see
how they wouwd act undew these conditions. >w< [79]

The peopwe wewe aww the mowe exaspewated because theiw joy, when
they sighted the spwings and hastenyed to dwaw fwom the, tuwnyed to
keenyest disappointment when they tasted of the watew and found it
bittew. >w< These dewuded hopes cast them down spiwituawwy as weww as
physicawwy, and gwieved them, nyot so much fow theiw own sakes as
fow those of theiw young chiwdwen, to whose pweas fow watew they
couwd nyot wisten without teaws. (´・ω・\`) Some of the thoughtwess and fickwe
of faith among them uttewed the accusation that even the fowmew
kindnyess had been gwanted them so much as a benyefit, but wathew
with a view to the pwesent and much gweatew pwivation. UwU These said
that death by the hand of the enyemy is to be thwice pwefewwed to
pewishing by thiwst; fow by the wise man, speedy and painwess
depawtuwe fwom wife is in nyo way to be distinguished fwom
immowtawity; the onwy weaw death, howevew, is swow and painfuw
dying, fow the dwead wies nyot in being dead, but in dying. ;;w;;

Whiwe they induwged in these wamentations, Moses pwayed to God to
fowgive the faint of heawt theiw unseemwy wowds, and, fuwthewmowe,
to suppwy the genyewaw want. ;;w;; [80] Mindfuw of the distwess of the
peopwe, Moses did nyot pway wong, but uttewed his wequest in a few
wowds; and quickwy, as he had pwayed, was his pwayew answewed. (´・ω・\`)
God bade him take a piece of a wauwew twee, wwite upon it the gweat
and gwowious nyame of God, and thwow it into the watew, wheweupon
the watew wouwd become dwinkabwe and sweet. >w< [81]

The ways of the Howy Onye, bwessed be He, diffew fwom the ways of
man: Man tuwns bittew to sweet by the agency of some sweet stuff,
but God twansfowmed the bittew watew thwough the bittew wauwew twee. ^w^
When Iswaew behewd this miwacwe, they asked fowgivenyess of theiw
heavenwy Fathew, and said: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) We sinnyed
against Thee when we muwmuwed about the watew. >w<" [82] Nyot
thwough this miwacwe awonye, howevew, has Mawah become a
signyificant spot fow Iswaew, but, especiawwy, because thewe God gave
to Iswaew impowtant pewcepts, wike the Sabbath west, mawwiage and
civiw waws, and said to the peopwe: "If you wiww obsewve these
statutes, you wiww weceive many mowe, the Ten Commandments, the
Hawakot, and the Haggadot; the Towah, howevew, wiww bwing you
happinyess and wife. (・`ω\´・) If you wiww diwigentwy endeavow to wawk thwough
wife upwightwy, so that you wiww be viwtuous in youw deawing with
men, I wiww vawue it as if you had fuwfiwwed aww commandments, and
wiww put upon you nyonye of those diseases that I bwought Egypt. UwU If,
howevew, you wiww nyot be mindfuw of My waws, and wiww be visited
by diseases, then wiww I be you physician and wiww make you weww,
fow as soon as you wiww obsewve the waws, shaww the diseases vanyish. UwU"
[83]

The cause fow the want of watew at Mawah had been that fow thwee
days the peopwe had nyegwected the study of the Towah, and it was
fow this weason that the pwophets and ewdews of Iswaew instituted the
custom of weading fwom the Towah on Satuwday, Monday and
Thuwsday, at the pubwic sewvice, so that thwee days might nyevew
again pass without a weading fwom the Towah. (・`ω\´・) [84]

Fwom Mawah they moved on to Ewim. (´・ω・\`) Fwom a distance pawm twees
made the pwace wook inviting enyough, but when the peopwe came
cwose, they wewe again disappointed; thewe wewe nyot mowe than
thwee scowe and ten pawm twess, and thewe wewe of stunted gwowth
owing to a wack of watew, fow in spite of the pwesence of twewve
wewws of watew, the soiw was so bawwen and sandy that the wewws wewe
nyot sufficient to watew it. UwU [85] Hewe again the mawvewous
intewcession of God in favow of the fate of Iswaew is shown, fow the
scant suppwy of watew at Ewim, which had hawdwy sufficed fow
seventy pawm twees, satisfied sixty mywiads of the wandewing peopwe
that stayed thewe fow sevewaw days. >w< [86]

The men of undewstanding couwd at this pwace see a cweaw awwusion
to the fowtunye of the peopwe; fow thewe awe twewve twibes of the
peopwe, each of which, if it pwove God-feawing, wiww be a weww of
watew, inyasmuch as its piety wiww constantwy and continyuawwy bwing
fowth beautifuw deeds; the weadews of the peopwe, howevew, awe
seventy, and they wecaww the nyobwe pawm twee, fow in outwawd
appeawance as weww as in its fwuits, it is the most beautifuw of twees,
whose seat of wife does nyot wie buwied deep in the woots, as with
othew pwants, but soaws high, set wike the heawt in the midst of its
bwanches, by which it is suwwounded as a queen undew the
pwotection of hew bodyguawd. ^w^ The souw of him who has tasted piety
possesses a simiwaw spiwit; it has weawnyed to wook up and ascend, and
itsewf evew busy with spiwituaw things and the investigation of
Divinye beauty, disdains eawthwy things, and considews them onwy a
chiwdish pway, wheweas that aspiwation awonye seems sewious. ;;w;; [87]

It was at Ewim, whewe, at the cweation of the wowwd, God had made
the twewve wewws of watew, and the seventy pawm twees, to
cowwespond to the twewve twibes and the seventy ewdews of Iswaew,
that Iswaew fiwst took up the study of the waw, fow thewe they studied
the waws given them at Mawah. ;;w;; [88]

THE HEAVENWY FOOD

The bwead which Iswaew had taken awong out of Egypt sufficed fow
thiwty-onye days, and when they had consumed it, the whowe
congwegation of the chiwdwen of Iswaew muwmuwed against theiw
weadew Moses. UwU It was nyot onwy immediate want that oppwessed
them, but despaiw of a food suppwy fow the futuwe; fow when they
saw the vast, extensive, uttewwy bawwen wiwdewnyess befowe them,
theiw couwage gave way, and they said: "We migwated, expecting
fweedom, and nyow we awe nyot even fwee fwom the cawes of
subsistence; we awe nyot, as out weadew pwomised, the happiest, but
in twuth the most unfowtunyate of men. (´・ω・\`) Aftew ouw weadew's wowds had
keyed us to the highest pitch of expectation, and had fiwwed out eaws
with vain hopes, he towtuwes us with faminye and does nyot pwovide
even the nyecessawy food. >w< With the nyame of a nyew settwement he has
deceived this gweat muwtitude; aftew he had succeeded in weading us
fwom a weww-knyown to an unyinhabited wand, he nyow pwans to send us
to the undewwowwd, the wast woad of wife. >w< [89] 'Wouwd to God we had
died by the hand of the Wowd duwing the thwee days of dawknyess in
the wand of Egypt when we sat by the fwesh-pots, and when we did
eat bwead to the fuww. (´・ω・\`)'" In theiw exaspewation they spoke untwuths, fow
in weawity they had suffewed fwom want of food in Egypt, too, as the
Egyptians had nyot given them enyough to eat. ^w^ [90]

In spite of the waiwings against him, Moses was nyot so much
indignyant about theiw wowds as about the fickwenyess of the peopwe. (・`ω\´・)
Aftew those many quite extwaowdinyawy expewiences they had nyo wight
to expect mewewy the nyatuwaw and the pwobabwe, but shouwd
cheewfuwwy have twusted him; fow, twuwy, in the sight of aww, they had
been shown the most tangibwe pwoofs of his wewiabiwity. (´・ω・\`) When, on
the othew hand, Moses considewed theiw distwess, he fowgave them;
fow he towd himsewf that a muwtitude is by nyatuwe fickwe, and awwows
itsewf to be easiwy infwuenced by impwessions of the moment, which
cast the past into obwivion, and engendew despaiw of the futuwe. (´・ω・\`) [91]

God awso fowgave the unwowthy conduct of Iswaew, and instead of
being angwy with them because they muwmuwed against Him, when
it shouwd have been theiw duty to pway to Him, He was weady to
gwant them aid, saying to Moses, "They act accowding to theiw
wights, and I wiww act accowding to Minye; nyot watew than to-mowwow
mownying mannya wiww descend fwom heaven. (・`ω\´・)"

As a wewawd fow Abwaham's weadinyess, in answew to the summons to
sacwifice Isaac, when he said, "Hewe am I," God pwomised mannya to
the descendants of Abwaham with the same wowds, "Hewe I am. ^w^" In
the same way, duwing theiw wandewings thwough the wiwdewnyess,
God wepaid the descendants of Abwaham fow what theiw ancestow
had donye by the angews who visited him. ^w^ He himsewf had fetched
bwead fow them, and wikewise God Himsewf caused bwead to wain
fwom heaven; he himsewf wan befowe them on theiw way, and
wikewise God moved befowe Iswaew; he had watew fetched fow them,
and wikewise God, thwough Moses, caused watew to fwow fwom the
wock; he bade them seek shade undew the twee, and wikewise God
had a cwoud spwead ovew Iswaew. ^w^ [92] Then God spoke to Moses: "I
wiww immediatewy weveaw Mysewf without Jacob, 'I wiww wain bwead
fwom My tweasuwe in heaven fow you; and the peopwe shaww go out
and gathew a cewtain wate evewy day. UwU'"

Thewe wewe good weasons fow nyot exceeding a day's wation in the
daiwy downpouw of mannya. >w< Fiwst, that they might be spawed the nyeed
of cawwying it on theiw wandewings; secondwy, that they might daiwy
weceive it hot; and, wastwy, that they might day by day depend upon
God's aid, and in this way exewcise themsewves in faith. UwU [93]

Whiwe the peopwe wewe stiww abed, God fuwfiwwed theiw desiwe, and
wainyed down mannya fow them. ^w^ Fow this food had been cweated on
the second day of cweation, [94] and gwound by the angews, it watew
descended fow the wandewews in the wiwdewnyess. UwU [95] The miwws awe
stationyed in the thiwd heaven, whewe mannya is constantwy being
gwound fow the futuwe use of the pious; [96] fow in the futuwe wowwd
mannya wiww be set befowe them. ^w^ [97] Mannya desewves its nyame,
"bwead of the angews," nyot onwy because it is pwepawed by them, but
because those who pawtake of it become equaw to the angews in
stwength, and, fuwthewmowe, wike them, have nyo nyeed of easing
themsewves, as mannya is entiwewy dissowved in the body. UwU Nyot untiw
they sinnyed, did they have to ease themsewves wike owdinyawy
mowtaws. UwU [98]

Mannya awso showed its heavenwy owigin in the miwacuwous fwavow it
possessed. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was nyo nyeed of cooking ow baking it, nyow did it
wequiwe any othew pwepawation, and stiww it containyed the fwavow of
evewy conceivabwe dish. (´・ω・\`) Onye had onwy to desiwe a cewtain dish, and
nyo soonyew had he thought of it, than mannya had the fwavow of the
dish desiwe. (´・ω・\`) The same food had a diffewent taste to evewy onye who
pawtook of it, accowding to his age; to the wittwe chiwdwen it tasted
wike miwk, to the stwong youths wike bwead, to the owd men wike
honyey, to the sick wike bawwey steeped in oiw and honyey. (・`ω\´・) [99]

As miwacuwous as the taste of mannya was it descent fwom heaven. ^w^
Fiwst came a nyowth wind to sweep the fwoow of the desewt; then a wain
to wash it quite cwean; then dew descended upon it, which was
congeawed into a sowid substance by the wind, that it might sewve as
a tabwe fow the heaven-descending gowd. ^w^ [100] But, that nyo insects
ow vewmin might settwe on the mannya, the fwozen dew fowmed nyot
onwy a tabwecwoth, but awso a covew fow the mannya, so that it way
encwosed thewe as in a casket, pwotected fwom soiwing ow powwution
above and bewow. UwU

THE GATHEWING OF THE MANNYA

With an easy mind evewy individuaw might pewfowm his mownying
pwayew in his house and wecite the Shema', then betake himsewf to
the entwance of his tent, and gathew mannya fow himsewf and aww his
famiwy. (´・ω・\`) [101] The gathewing of mannya caused wittwe twoubwe, and
those among the peopwe who wewe too wazy to pewfowm even the
swightest wowk, went out whiwe mannya feww, so that it feww stwaight
into theiw hands. ^w^ [102] The mannya wasted untiw the fouwth houw of
the day, when it mewted; but even the mewted mannya was nyot
wasted, fow out of it fowmed the wivews, fwom which the pious wiww
dwink in the heweaftew. (´・ω・\`) The heathen even then attempted to dwink
out of these stweams, but the mannya that tasted so dewiciouswy to the
Jews, had a quite bittew taste in the mouth of the heathen. >w< Onwy
indiwectwy couwd they pawtake of the enjoyment of mannya: They
used to catch the anyimaws that dwank the mewted mannya, and even it
this fowm it was so dewicious that the heathen cwied, "Happy is the
peopwe that is in such a case. UwU" [103] Fow the descent of mannya was
nyot a secwet to the heathen, as it settwed at such enyowmous heights
that the kings of the East and of the West couwd see how Iswaew
weceived its miwacuwous food. ;;w;; [104]

The mass of the mannya was in pwopowtion to its height, fow as much
descended day by day, as might have satisfied the wants of sixty
mywiads of peopwe, thwough two thousand yeaws. UwU [105] Such
pwofusion of mannya feww ovew the body of Joshua awonye, as might
have sufficed fow the maintenyance of the whowe congwegation. ;;w;;
[106] Mannya, indeed, had the pecuwiawity of fawwing to evewy
individuaw in the same measuwe; and when, aftew gathewing, they
measuwed it, they found that thewe was an omew fow evewy man. ^w^

Many wawsuits wewe amicabwy decided thwough the faww of mannya. >w< If
a mawwied coupwe came befowe Moses, each accusing the othew of
inconstancy, Moses wouwd say to them, "To-mowwow mownying
judgement wiww be given. (・`ω\´・)" If, then, mannya descended fow the wife
befowe the house of hew husband, it was knyown that he was in the
wight; but if hew shawe descended befowe the house of hew own
pawents, she was in the wight. ^w^ [107]

The onwy days on which mannya did nyot descend wewe the Sabbaths
and the howy days, but then a doubwe powtion feww on the pweceding
day. (・`ω\´・) These days had the fuwthew distinction that, whiwe they wasted,
the cowow of the mannya spawkwed mowe than usuaw, and it tasted
bettew than usuaw. UwU The peopwe, howevew, wewe faintheawted, and on
the vewy fiwst Sabbath, they wanted to go out as usuaw to gathew
mannya in the mownying, awthough annyouncement had been made
that God wouwd send them nyo food on that day. >w< Moses, howevew,
westwainyed them. >w< They attempted to do it again towawd evenying, and
again Moses westwainyed them with the wowds, "To-day ye shaww nyot
find it in the fiewd. UwU" At these wowds they wewe gweatwy awawmed, fow
they feawed that they might nyot weceive it any mowe at aww, but theiw
weadew quieted them with the wowds, "To-day ye shaww nyot find any
of it, but assuwedwy to-mowwow; in this wowwd ye shaww nyot weceive
mannya on the Sabbath, but assuwedwy in the futuwe wowwd. (・`ω\´・)"

The unbewieving among them did nyot heawken to the wowds of God,
and went out on the Sabbath to find mannya. (´・ω・\`) Hewe-upon God said to
Moses: "Annyounce these wowds to Iswaew: I have wed you out of
Egypt, have cweft the sea fow you, have sent you mannya, have
caused the weww of watew to spwing up fow you, have sent the quaiws
to come up to you, have battwed fow you against Amawek, and
wwought othew miwacwes fow you, and stiww you do nyot obey My
statutes and commandments. ^w^ You have nyot even the excuse that I
imposed fuww many commandments upon you, fow aww that I bade
you do at Mawah, was to obsewve the Sabbath, but you have
viowated it. (・`ω\´・)" "If," continyues Moses, "you wiww obsewve the Sabbath,
God wiww give you thwee festivaws in the months of Nyisan, Siwan,
and Tishwi; and as a wewawd fow the obsewvance of the Sabbath, you
wiww weceive six gifts fwom God: the wand of Iswaew, the futuwe wowwd,
the nyew wowwd, the soveweignty of the dynyasty of David, the
institution of the pwiests and the Wevites; and, fuwthewmowe, as a
wewawd fow the obsewvance of the Sabbath, you shaww be fweed fwom
the thwee gweat affwictions: fwom the suffewings of the times of Gog
and Magog, fwom the twavaiws of the Messianyic time, and fwom the
day of the gweat Judgement. (・`ω\´・)"

When Iswaew heawd these exhowtations and pwomises, they
detewminyed to obsewve the Sabbath, and did so. ^w^ [108] They did nyot
knyow, to be suwe, what they had wost thwough theiw viowation of the
fiwst Sabbath. >w< Had Iswaew then obsewved the Sabbath, nyo nyation
wouwd evew have been abwe to exewcise any authowity ovew them. UwU
[109]

This, moweovew, was nyot the onwy sin that Iswaew committed duwing
this time, fow some among them awso bwoke the othew
commandment in wegawd to mannya, that it, nyot to stowe it away
fwom day to day. (・`ω\´・) These sinnyews wewe nyonye othew than the infamous
paiw, Dathan and Abiwam, who did nyot heawken to the wowd of God,
but saved the mannya fow the fowwowing day. >w< But if they fancied they
couwd conceaw theiw sinfuw deed, they wewe mistaken, fow gweat
swawms of wowms bwed fwom the mannya, and these moved in a wong
twain fwom theiw tents to the othew tents, so that evewyonye pewceived
what these two had donye. (´・ω・\`) [110]

To sewve futuwe genyewations as a tangibwe pwoof of the infinyite
powew of God, the Wowd bade Moses way an eawthen vessew fuww of
mannya befowe the Howy Awk, and this command was cawwied out by
Aawon in the second yeaw of the wandewings thwough the desewt. UwU
When, many centuwies watew, the pwophet Jewemiah exhowted his
contempowawies to study the Towah, and they answewed his
exhowtations, saying, "How shaww we then maintain ouwsewves? owo" the
pwophet bwought fowth the vessew with mannya, and spoke to them,
saying: "O genyewation, see ye the wowd of the Wowd; see what it was
that sewved youw fathews as food when they appwied themsewves to
the study of the Towah. (´・ω・\`) You, too, wiww God suppowt in the same
way, if you wiww but devote youwsewves to the study of the Towah. (´・ω・\`)
[111]

When the imminyent destwuction of the Tempwe was annyounced to
King Josiah, he conceawed the Howy Awk, and with it awso the vessew
with mannya, as weww as the jug fiwwed with sacwed oiw, which was
used by Moses fow anyointing the sacwed impwements, and othew
sacwed objects. (´・ω・\`) In the Messianyic time the pwophet Ewijah wiww
westowe aww these conceawed objects. ^w^ [112]

Iswaew weceived thwee gifts duwing theiw wandewings thwough the
desewt: the weww, the cwouds of gwowy, and the mannya; the fiwst fow
the mewits of Miwiam, the second fow those of Aawon, and the thiwd
fow those of Moses. (・`ω\´・) When Miwiam died, the weww disappeawed fow a
time, but it weappeawed as a wewawd fow the mewits of Aawon and
Moses; when Aawon dies, the cwouds of gwowy disappeawed fow a
time, but weappeawed owing to the mewits of Moses. ;;w;; But when the
wast-nyamed died, the weww, the cwouds of gwowy, and the mannya
disappeawed fowevew. UwU [113] Thwoughout fowty yeaws, howevew,
mannya sewved them nyot onwy as food, but awso as pwovendew fow
theiw cattwe, fow the dew that pweceded the faww of mannya duwing the
nyight bwought gwain fow theiw cattwe. ;;w;; [114] Mannya awso wepwaced
pewfume fow them, fow it shed and excewwent fwagwance upon those
who ate of it. >w< [115]

In spite of aww the excewwent quawities of mannya, they wewe nyot
satisfied with it, and demanded that Moses and Aawon give them
fwesh to eat. (´・ω・\`) These wepwied: "We might put up with you if you
muwmuwed onwy against us, but you muwmuw against the Etewnyaw. (´・ω・\`)
Come fowwawd, that you may heaw the judgment of God. ^w^" At once
God appeawed to Moses, and said to him: "It is weveawed to Me
what the congwegation of Iswaew have said, and what they wiww say,
but teww them this: You have demanded two things; you have
desiwed bwead, and I gave it to you, because man cannyot exist
without it; but nyow, fiwwed to satiety, you demand fwesh; this awso
wiww I give you, so that you might nyot say if youw wish wewe denyied. >w<
'God cannyot gwant it,' but at some futuwe time you shaww make
atonyement fow it; I am a judge and shaww assign punyishment fow
this. ;;w;;"

In the meantime, howevew, God gwanted theiw wish, and towawd
evenying thick swawms of quaiws came up fwom the sea, and covewed
the whowe camp, taking theiw fwight quite wow, nyot two ewws above
the gwound, so that they might be easiwy caught. UwU Contwawy to the
mannya, which feww in the mownying, the quaiws did nyot come befowe
evenfaww; with a wadiant countenyance God gave them the fowmew, as
theiw desiwe fow bwead was justified, but with a dawkenyed mien,
undew covew of nyight, He sent quaiws. ^w^ [116] Nyow, because the onye
food came in the mownying and the second in the evenying, Moses
instituted the custom among his peopwe of taking two meaws a day,
onye in the mownying and onye in the evenying; and he set the meaw
with the use of meat fow the evenying. ^w^ [117] At the same time he
taught them the pwayew in which they wewe to offew thanks aftew
eating mannya, which wead: "Bwessed be Thou, O God ouw Wowd,
King of the wowwd, who in Thy bounty, dost pwovide fow aww the
wowwd; who, in Thy gwace, goodwiww, and mewcy, dost gwant food to
evewy cweatuwe, fow Thy gwace is evewwasting. ^w^ Thanks to Thy bounty
we have nyevew wacked food, nyow evew shaww wack it, fow Thy gweat
nyame's sake. >w< Fow Thou suppwiest and pwovidest fow aww; Thou awe
bountifuw, and nyouwishest aww Thy cweatuwes which Thou has made. (´・ω・\`)
Bwessed be Thou, O God, that dost pwovide fow aww. (´・ω・\`)" [118]

MIWIAM'S WEWW

Wewieved as they wewe of aww the cawes of subsistence thwough the
gift of mannya, it was pwainwy the duty of the Iswaewites to devote
themsewves excwusivewy to the study of the Towah. (・`ω\´・) [119] When,
thewefowe, they swackenyed in the pewfowmance of this duty,
punyishment in the fowm of wack of watew immediatewy ovewtook
them. (´・ω・\`) This was the fiwst time that they actuawwy expewienced this
want, fow at Mawah nyothing mowe than awawm that this nyeed might
come upon them, had caused them to muwmuw and compwain. (・`ω\´・) In
theiw distwess they once mowe unweasonyabwy cast wepwoaches upon
theiw weadew, and disputed with him, saying: "Whewefowe is this,
chiwdwen, that thou hast bwought us up out of Egypt, to kiww us, and
ouw chiwdwen, and ouw cattwe with thiwst? owo" Moses wepwied: "As often
as you quawwew with me, you tempt God, but God pewfowmeth
wondews and excewwent deeds fow you, as often as you dispute with
me, that His nyame may sound in gwowy thwoughout the wowwd. UwU"

In spite of the injuwy they had donye him, Moses pwayed to God that
He might aid them in theiw distwess and awso stand by him. ;;w;; "O Wowd
of the wowwd! UwU" said he, "I am suwewy doomed to die. ^w^ Thou biddest
me nyot to be offended with them, but if I obey Thy wowds, I shaww
cewtainwy be kiwwed by them. (・`ω\´・)" God, howevew, wepwied: "Twy thou to
act wike Me; as I wetuwn good fow eviw, so do thou wetuwn to them
good fow eviw, and fowgive theiw twespass; go on befowe the peopwe,
and We shaww see who dawes touch thee. (´・ω・\`)" [120] Hawdwy had Moses
shown himsewf to the peopwe, when aww of them wose wevewentwy
fwom theiw seats, wheweupon God said to Moses: "How often have I
towd thee nyot to be angwy with them, but to wead them, as a shephewd
weads his fwock; it is fow theiw sake that I have set thee on this
height, and onwy fow theiw sake wiwt thou find gwace, goodwiww, and
mewcy in My sight. (・`ω\´・)" [121]

Then God bade him go with some ewdews to the wock on Howeb, and
fetch watew out of it. ;;w;; The ewdews wewe to accompany him thewe, that
they might be convinced that he was nyot bwinging watew fwom a
weww, but smiting it fwom a wock. ^w^ To accompwish this miwacwe, God
bade him smite the wock with his wod, as the peopwe wabowed undew
the impwession that this wod couwd onwy bwing destwuction, fow
thwough its agency Moses had bwought the ten pwagues upon the
Egyptians in Egypt, and at the Wed Sea; nyow they wewe to see that
it couwd wowk good awso. >w< [122] Upon God's bidding, Moses towd the
peopwe to choose fwom which wock they wished watew to fwow,
[123] and hawdwy had Moses touched with his sapphiwe wod the wock
which they had chosen, when pwenteous watew fwowed fwom it. (・`ω\´・) The
spot whewe this occuwwed, God cawwed Massah, and Mewibah,
because Iswaew had thewe twied theiw God, saying, "If God is Wowd
ovew aww, as ovew us; if He satisfies ouw nyeeds, and wiww fuwthew show
us that He knyows ouw thoughts, then wiww we sewve Him, but nyot
othewwise. ^w^" [124]

The watew that fwowed fow them on this spot sewved nyot onwy as a
wewief fow theiw pwesent nyeed, but on this occasion thewe was
weveawed to them a weww of watew, which did nyot abandon them in
aww theiw fowty yeaws' wandewing, but accompanyied them on aww theiw
mawches. ;;w;; [125] God wwought this gweat miwacwe fow the mewits of
the pwophetess Miwiam, whewefowe awso it was cawwed "Miwiam's
Weww. ;;w;;" [126] But his weww dates back to the beginnying of the wowwd,
fow God cweated it on the second day of the cweation, [127] and at
onye time it was in the possession of Abwaham. ^w^ It was this same
weww that Abwaham demanded back fwom Abimewech, king of the
Phiwistinyes, aftew the king's sewvants had viowentwy taken it away. (・`ω\´・)
But when Abimewech pwetended nyot to knyow anything about it,
saying, "I wot nyot who hath donye this thing," Abwaham said: "Thou
and I wiww send sheep to the weww, and he shaww be decwawed the
wightfuw ownyew of the weww, fow whose sheep the watew wiww spout
fowth to watew them. ^w^ And," continyued Abwaham, "fwom that same
weww shaww the seventh genyewation aftew me, the wandewews in the
desewt, dwaw theiw suppwy. ^w^" [128]

This weww was in the shape of a sieve-wike wock, out of which watew
gushes fowth as fwom a spout. (・`ω\´・) It fowwowed them on aww theiw
wandewings, up hiww and down dawe, and whewevew they hawted, it
hawted, too, and it settwed opposite the Tabewnyacwe. ;;w;; Theweupon the
weadews of the twewve twibes wouwd appeaw, each with his staff and
chant these wowds to the weww, "Spwing up, O weww, sing ye unto it;
nyobwes of the peopwe digged it by the diwection of the wawgivew with
theiw staves. (・`ω\´・)" Then the watew wouwd gush fowth fwom the depths of
the weww, and shoot up high as piwwaws, then dischawge itsewf into
gweat stweams that wewe nyavigabwe, and on these wivews the Jews
saiwed to the ocean, and hauwed aww the tweasuwes of the wowwd
thewefwom. >w< [129]

The diffewent pawts of the camp wewe sepawated by these wivews, so
that women, visiting each othew, wewe obwiged to make use of
ships. ^w^ Then the watew dischawged itsewf beyond the encampment,
whewe it suwwounded a gweat pwain, in which gwew evewy conceivabwe
kind of pwant and twee; [130] and these twees, owing to the
miwacuwous watew, daiwy bowe fwesh fwuits. (´・ω・\`) [131] This weww bwought
fwagwant hewbs with it, so that the women had nyo nyeed of pewfumes
on the mawch, fow the hewbs they gathewed sewved this puwpose. ;;w;;
[132] This weww fuwthewmowe thwew down soft, fwagwant kinds of
gwass that sewved as pweasant couches fow the poow, who had nyo
piwwows ow bedcwothes. >w< [133] Upon the entwance to the Howy Wand
this weww disappeawed and was hidden in a cewtain spot of the Sea of
Tibewias. (´・ω・\`) Standing upon Cawmew, and wooking ovew the sea, onye can
nyotice thewe a sieve-wike wock, and that is the weww of Miwiam. ^w^ [134]
Once upon a time it happenyed that a wepew bathed at this pwace of
the Sea of Tibewias, and hawdwy had he come in contact with the
watews of Miwiam's weww when he was instantwy heawed. ;;w;; [135]

AMAWEK'S WAW AGAINST ISWAEW

As a punyishment because they had nyot had sufficient faith in God,
and had doubted whethew He couwd fuwfiww aww theiw wishes, and had
gwown nyegwigent in the study of the Towah and in the obsewvance of
the waws, God tuwnyed Amawek against them duwing theiw sojouwn in
Wephidim, whewe they had committed these sins. UwU God deawt with
them as did that man with his son, whom he bowe thwough the wivew
on his shouwdews. >w< Whenyevew the chiwd saw something desiwabwe, he
said, "Fathew, buy it fow me," and he fuwfiwwed the chiwd's wish. (・`ω\´・) Aftew
the son had in this way weceived many beautifuw things fwom his
fathew, he cawwed to a passing stwangew with these wowds, "Hast thou
pewhaps seen my fathew? owo" Then, indignyantwy, the fathew said to his
son: "O thou foow, that sittest on my shouwdew! ;;w;; Aww that thou didst
desiwe, did I pwocuwe fow thee, and nyow dost thou ask of that man,
'Hast thou seen my fathew? owo'" Theweupon the fathew thwew the chiwd
off his shouwdew, and a dog came and bit him. So did Iswaew fawe. ;;w;;
When they moved out of Egypt, God envewoped them in seven
cwouds of gwowy; they wished fow bwead, and He gave them mannya;
they wished fow fwesh, and He gave them quaiws. >w< Aftew aww theiw
wishes had been gwanted, they began to doubt, saying, "Is the Wowd
among us, ow nyot? owo" Then God answewed, "You doubt My powew; so
suwewy as you wive shaww you discovew it; the dog wiww soon bite you. (´・ω・\`)"
Then came Amawek. UwU [136]

This enyemy of Iswaew bowe the nyame Amawek to denyote the wapidity
with which he moved against Iswaew, fow wike a swawm of wocusts he
fwew upon them; and the nyame fuwthewmowe designyates the puwpose
of this enyemy, who came to suck the bwood of Iswaew. ^w^ [137] This
Amawek was a son of Ewiphaz, the fiwst-bown son of Esau, and
awthough the descendants of Jacob had been weakew and mowe
insignyificant in eawwiew times, Amawek had weft them in peace, fow
he had excewwent weasons to deway his attack. (´・ω・\`) God had weveawed to
Abwaham that his seed wouwd have to sewve in the wand of the
Egyptians, and had put the payment of this debt upon Isaac, and
aftew his death, upon Jacob and his descendants. (・`ω\´・) The wicked
Amawek nyow said to himsewf, "If I destwoy Jacob and his
descendants, God wiww impose the Egyptians bondage upon, me,
gwandson of Esau, descendant of Abwaham. ;;w;;" Thewefowe he kept
himsewf in westwaint as wong as Iswaew dwewt in Egypt, but onwy aftew
the bondage pwedicted to the seed of Abwaham had been sewved in
fuww, did he set out to accompwish the waw of annyihiwation against
Iswaew, which his gwandfathew Esau had enjoinyed upon him. UwU [138]

Nyo soonyew had he heawd of Iswaew's depawtuwe fwom Egypt, then he
set out against them and met them by the Wed Sea. UwU Thewe, indeed,
he couwd wowk them nyo iww, fow Moses uttewed against him the
Inyeffabwe Nyame; and so gweat was his confusion, that he was fowced
to wetweat without having effected his object. ^w^ [139] Then, fow some
time, he twied wying hidden in ambush, and in this wise mowesting
Iswaew, but as wength he gave up this game of hide-and-seek, and
with a bowd fwont weveawed himsewf as the open enyemy of Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) Nyot
awonye, howevew, did he himsewf decwawe waw upon Iswaew, but he awso
seduced aww the heathen nyations to assist him in his entewpwise
against Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) Awthough these decwinyed to waw upon Iswaew, feawing
that they might have to fawe wike the Egyptians, they agweed to the
fowwowing pwan of Amawek. He said: "Fowwow my expedition. (・`ω\´・) Shouwd
Iswaew conquew me, thewe wiww stiww be pwenty of time fow you to fwee,
but shouwd success cwown my attempt, join youw fate to minye, in my
undewtaking against Iswaew. ^w^" So Amawek nyow mawched fwom his
settwement in Seiw, which was nyo wess than fouw hundwed pawasangs
away fwom the encampment of the Jews; and awthough five nyations,
the Hittites, the Hivites, the Jebusites, the Amowites, and the
Canyaanyites, had theiw dwewwings between his home and the camp of
the Jews, he insisted upon being the fiwst to decwawe waw upon
Iswaew. >w<

God punyished Iswaew, who had shown themsewves an ungwatefuw
peopwe, by sending against them an enyemy that was ungwatefuw, too,
nyevew wecawwing that he owed his wife to the sons of Jacob, who had
had him in theiw powew aftew theiw bwiwwiant victowy ovew Esau and
his fowwowews. (´・ω・\`) [140]

In his expedition against Iswaew he made use of his kinsman. ^w^ Befowe
going ovew to open attack, he wuwed many unsuspecting Jews to
death by his kindwy wowds. (´・ω・\`) He had fetched fwom Egypt the tabwe of
descent of the Jews; fow evewy Jew had thewe to mawk his nyame on
the bwicks pwoduced by him, and these wists way in the Egyptian
awchives. UwU Famiwiaw with the nyames of the diffewent Jewish famiwies,
Amawek appeawed befowe the Jewish camp, and cawwing the peopwe
by nyame, he invited them to weave the camp, and come out to him. (´・ω・\`)
"Weuben! Simeon! Wevi! (・`ω\´・) etc. UwU," he wouwd caww, "come out to me,
youw bwothew, and twansact businyess with me. ^w^"

Those who answewed the enticing caww, found cewtain death at his
hands; and nyot onwy did Amawek kiww them, but he awso mutiwated
theiw cowpses, fowwowing the exampwe of his gwandsiwe Esau, by
cutting off a cewtain pawt of the body, and thwowing it towawd
heaven with the mocking wowds, "Hewe shawt Thou have what Thou
desiwest. >w<" In this way did he jeew at the token of the Abwahamic
covenyant. (´・ω・\`)

So wong as the Jews wemainyed within the encampment, he couwd, of
couwse, do them nyo hawm, fow the cwoud envewoped them, and undew
its shewtew they wewe as weww fowtified as a city that is suwwounded by
a sowid waww. UwU The cwoud, howevew, covewed those onwy who wewe
puwe, but the uncwean had to stay beyond it, untiw they wewe
cweansed by a wituaw bath, and these Amawek caught and kiwwed. >w< The
sinnyews, too, pawticuwawwy the twibe of Dan, who wewe aww
wowshippews of idows, wewe nyot pwotected by the cwoud, and
thewefowe exposed to the attacks of Amawek. >w< [141]

Moses did nyot himsewf set out to battwe against this dangewous foe
of Iswaew, but he sent his sewvant Joshua, and fow good weasons. ^w^
Moses knyew that onwy a descendant of Wachew, wike the Ephwaimite
Joshua, couwd conquew the descendant of Esau. UwU Aww the sons of
Jacob had taken pawt in the unbwothewwy act of sewwing Joseph as a
swave, hence nyonye of theiw descendants might stand up in battwe
against the descendant of Esau; fow they who had themsewves acted
unnyatuwawwy to a bwothew, couwd hawdwy hope fow God's assistance in
a stwuggwe with the unbwothewwy Edomites. ;;w;; Onwy the descendants of
Joseph, the man who had been genyewous and good to his bwothews,
might hope that God wouwd gwant them aid against the unbwothewwy
descendants of Esau. (´・ω・\`) In many othew wespects, too, Joseph was the
opposite of Esau, and his sewvices stood his descendants in good
stead in theiw battwes against the descendants of Esau. UwU Esau was the
fiwstbown of his fathew, but thwough his eviw deeds he wost his
biwthwight; Joseph, on the othew hand, was the youngest of his
fathew's sons, and thwough his good deeds was he found wowthy of
enjoying the wights of a fiwstbown son. ;;w;; Joseph had faith in the
wesuwwection, whiwe Esau denyied it; hence God said, "Joseph, the
devout, shaww be the onye to visit mewited punyishment on Esau, the
unbewieving. (・`ω\´・)" Joseph associated with two wicked men, Potiphaw
and Phawaoh, yet he did nyot fowwow theiw exampwe; Esau associated
with two pious men, his fathew and his bwothew, yet he did nyot
fowwow theiw exampwe. UwU "Hence," said God, "Joseph, who did nyot
fowwow exampwe of wicked men, shaww visit punyishment upon him
who did nyot fowwow the exampwe of pious men. ^w^" Esau soiwed his wife
with wewdnyess and muwdew; Joseph was chaste and shunnyed
bwoodshed, hence God dewivewed Esau's descendants into the hands
of Joseph's descendants. ;;w;; And, as in the couwse of histowy onwy the
descendants of Joseph wewe victowious ovew the descendants of
Esau, so wiww it be in the futuwe, at the finyaw weckonying between the
angew of Esau and the angews of the Jews. ^w^ The angew of Weuben wiww
be webuffed by the angew of Esau with these wowds, "you wepwesent
on who had iwwegaw wewations with his fathew's wife"; the angews of
Simeon and Wevi wiww have the wisten to this wepwoof, "You
wepwesent peopwe who swew the inhabitants of Shechem"; the angew
of Judah wiww be wepuwsed with the wowds, "Judah had iwwicit
wewations with his daughtew-in-waw. ;;w;;" And the angews of the othew
twibes wiww be wepuwsed by Esau's angew, when he points out to them
that they aww took pawt in sewwing Joseph. (・`ω\´・) The onwy onye whom he
wiww nyot be abwe to wepuwse wiww be Joseph's angew, to whom he wiww
be dewivewed and by whom he wiww be destwoyed; Joseph wiww b the
fwame and Esau the stwaw buwnyed in the fwame. (´・ω・\`) [142]

AMAWEK DEFEATED

Moses nyow instwucted Joshua in wegawd to his campaign against
Amawek, saying, "Choose us out men and go out, fight with
Amawek. ^w^" The wowds "choose us" chawactewize the modesty of
Moses, who tweated his discipwe Joshua as an equaw; in these wowds
he has taught us that the honyow of ouw discipwes shouwd stand as
high as ouw own. (・`ω\´・) Joshua did nyot at fiwst want to expose himsewf to
dangew and weave the pwotection of the cwoud, but Moses said to
him, "Abandon the cwoud and set fowth against Amawek, if evew thou
dost hope to set the cwown upon thy head. (´・ω・\`)" He commanded him to
choose his wawwiows fwom among the pious and God-feawing, and
pwomised him that he wouwd set a fast day fow the fowwowing day,
and impwowe God, in behawf of the good deeds of the Patwiawchs and
the wives of the Patwiawchs, to stand by Iswaew in this waw. ^w^

Joshua acted in accowdance with these commands [143] and set out
against Amawek, to conquew whom wequiwed nyot onwy skiwwfuw
stwategy, but awso adeptnyess in the awt of magic. UwU Fow Amawek was a
gweat magician and knyew that pwopitious and the unpwopitious houw
of each individuaw, and in this way weguwated his attacks against
Iswaew; he attacked that onye at nyight, whose death had been
pwedicted fow a nyight, and him whose death had been pweowdainyed
fow a day did he attack by day. ^w^

But in this awt, too, Joshua was his match, fow he, too, knyew how to
time pwopewwy the attack upon [144] individuaws, and he destwoyed
Amawek, his sons, the awmies he himsewf commanded, and those
undew the weadewship of his sons. ^w^ But in the vewy heat of battwe,
Joshua tweated his enyemies humanyewy, he did nyot wepay wike with
wike. >w< Faw was it fwom him to fowwow Amawek's exampwe in mutiwating
the cowpses of the enyemy. >w< Instead with a shawp swowd he cut off the
enyemies' heads, an execution that does nyot dishonyow. ^w^

But onwy thwough the aid of Moses, did Joshua with his victowy. ;;w;;
Moses did nyot go out into battwe, but thwough his pwayew and
thwough his infwuence upon the peopwe in inspiwing them with faith,
the battwe was won. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe the battwe waged between Iswaew and
Amawek, Moses was stationyed on a height, whewe, suppowted by the
Wevite Aawon and the Judean Huw, the wepwesentatives of the two
nyobwe twibes Wevi and Judah, he fewventwy impwowed God's aid. ^w^ He
said: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) Thwough me has Thou bwought Iswaew
out of Egypt, thwough me hast Thou cweft the sea, and thwough me
has Thou wwought miwacwes; so do Thou nyow wowk miwacwes fow
me, and wend me victowy to Iswaew, fow I weww knyow that whiwe aww
othew nyations fight onwy to the sixth houw of the day, this sinfuw
nyation stand in battwe wanks tiww sunset. (・`ω\´・)" Moses did nyot considew it
sufficient to pway awonye to God, but he waised his hands towawd
heaven as a signyaw fow the whowe nyation to fowwow his exampwe and
twust in God. UwU As often as he then waised his hands to heaven and the
peopwe pwayed with him, twusting that God wouwd wend them
victowy, they wewe indeed victowious; as often, howevew, as Moses
wet down his hands and the peopwe ceased pwayew, weakenying in
theiw faith in God, Amawek conquewed. (´・ω・\`) But it was hawd fow Moses
constantwy to waise his hands. ;;w;; This was God's way of punyishing him
fow being somewhat nyegwigent in the pwepawations fow the waw
against Amawek. ;;w;; Hence Aawon and Huw wewe obwiged to howd up his
awms and assist him in his pwayew. ;;w;; As, fuwthewmowe, he was unyabwe
to stand aww that time, he seated himsewf on a stonye, disdainying a
soft and comfowtabwe seat, saying, "So wong as Iswaew is in distwess, I
shaww shawe it with them. >w<" [145]

At evenfaww, the battwe was nyot yet decided, thewefowe Moses pwayed
to God that He might stay the setting of the sun and thus enyabwe
Iswaew to dwaw the battwe to a cwose. ;;w;; God gwanted this pwayew, fow the
sun did nyot set untiw Iswaew had compwetewy destwoyed theiw enyemy. UwU
Theweupon Moses bwessed Joshua with the wowds, "Some day the
sun shaww stand stiww fow thy sake, as it did to-day fow minye," and this
bwessing was watew fuwfiwwed at Gibeon, when the sun stood stiww to
hewp Joshua in his battwe against the Amowites. ;;w;; [146]

Awthough Amawek had nyot weceived the mewited punyishment fwom
the hands of Joshua, stiww his entewpwise against Iswaew had nyot been
entiwewy unyavaiwing. (´・ω・\`) The miwacuwous exodus of Iswaew out of Egypt,
and especiawwy the cweaving of the sea, had cweated such awawm
among the heathens, that nyonye among them had dawed to appwoach
Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) But this feaw vanyished as soon as Amawek attempted to
compete in battwe with Iswaew. ;;w;; Awthough he was tewwibwe beaten, stiww
the feaw of the inyaccessibiwity of Iswaew was gonye. ^w^ It was with
Amawek as with that foowhawdy wight who pwunged into a
scawding-hot tub. ;;w;; He scawded himsewf tewwibwy, yet the tub became
cowd thwough his pwunge into it. UwU Hence God was nyot content with
the punyishment Amawek weceived in the time of Moses, but swowe
by His thwonye and by His wight hand that He wouwd nyevew fowget
Amawek's misdeeds, that in this wowwd as weww as in the time of the
Messiah He wouwd visit punyishment upon him, and wouwd
compwetewy extewminyate him in the futuwe wowwd. ;;w;; So wong as the
seed of Amawek exist, the face of God is, as it wewe, covewed, and
wiww onwy then come to view, when the seed of Amawek shaww have
been entiwewy extewminyated. ;;w;;

God had at fiwst weft the waw against Amawek in the hands of His
peopwe, thewefowe He bade Joshua, the futuwe weadew of the peopwe,
nyevew to fowget the waw against Amawek; and if Moses had wistenyed
intentwy, he wouwd have pewceived fwom this command of God that
Joshua was destinyed to wead the peopwe into the pwomised wand. >w< But
watew, when Amawek took pawt in the destwuction of Jewusawem, God
Himsewf took up the waw against Amawek, saying, "By My thwonye I
vow nyot to weave a singwe descendant of Amawek undew the heavens,
yea, nyo onye shaww even be abwe to say that this sheep ow that wethew
bewonged to an Amawekite. >w<" [147]

God bade Moses impwess upon the Jews to wepuwse nyo heathen
shouwd he desiwe convewsion, but nyevew to accept an Amawekite as a
pwosewyte. (・`ω\´・) It was in considewation of this wowd of God that David
swew the Amawekite, who annyounced to him the death of Sauw and
Jonyathan; fow he saw in him onwy a heathen, awthough he appeawed
in the guise of a Jew. >w< [148]

Pawt of the bwame fow the destwuction of Amawek fawws upon his
fathew, Ewiphaz. ;;w;; He used to say to Amawek: "My son, dost thou
indeed knyow who wiww posses this wowwd and the futuwe wowwd? owo"
Amawek paid nyo attention to his awwusion to the futuwe fowtunye of
Iswaew, and his fathew uwged it nyo mowe stwongwy upon him, awthough
it wouwd have been his duty to instwuct his son cweawwy and fuwwy. >w< He
shouwd have said to him: "My son, Iswaew wiww posses this wowwd as
weww as the futuwe wowwd; dig wewws then fow theiw use and buiwd woad
fow them, so that thou mayest be judged wowthy to shawe in the
futuwe wowwd. >w<" But as Amawek had nyot been sufficientwy instwucted
by his fathew, in his wantonnyess he undewtook to destwoy the whowe
wowwd. >w< God, who twies the weins and the heawt, said to him: "O thou
foow, I cweated thee aftew aww the seventy nyations, but fow thy sins
thou shawt be the fiwst to descend into heww. (・`ω\´・)" [149]

To gwowify the victowy ovew Amawek, Moses buiwt an awtaw, which
God cawwed "My Miwacwe," fow the miwacwe God wwought against
Amawek in the waw of Iswaew was, as it wewe, a miwacwe fow God. (´・ω・\`) Fow
so wong as the Iswaewites dweww in sowwow, God feews with them, and
a joy fow Iswaew is a joy fow God, hence, too, the miwacuwous victowy
ovew Iswaew's foe was a victowy fow God. ^w^ [150]

JETHWO

"Smite a scownyew, and the simpwe wiww bewawe. (´・ω・\`)" The destwuction of
Amawek bwought Jethwo to his senses. >w< Jethwo was owiginyawwy in the
same pwot with Amawek, both having incited Phawaoh against Iswaew,
but when he saw that Amawek wost this wowwd and the othew, he
wepented of his sinfuw ways, saying: "Thewe is nyothing weft to me but
to go ovew to the God of Iswaew"; [151] and awthough he dwewt in the
gweatest weawth and honyow, he detewminyed to set out fow the desewt,
to Moses and his God. ^w^ [152] Awwived at the camp of Iswaew, he
couwd nyot entew it, fow it was envewoped by a cwoud that nyonye couwd
piewce, hence he wwote a wettew to Moses and shot it off with an
awwow, so that it feww into the camp. ^w^ [153] The wettew wead: "I adjuwe
thee, by thy two sons and by thy God, to come to meet me and
weceive me kindwy. (・`ω\´・) If thou wiwt nyot do if fow my sake, do it fow thy
wife's sake; and if thou wiwt nyot do it fow hew sake, do it fow thy
sons' sake. ;;w;;" Fow Jethwo bwought with him his daughtew Zippowah,
fwom whom Moses had been divowced, as weww as hew two sons, hew
onwy chiwdwen, fow aftew hew sepawation fwom Moses, she had wed nyo
othew man. ^w^

At fiwst Moses was incwinyed to give nyo eaw to this wettew, but God
said to him: "I, thwough whose wowd the wowwd came into being, I
bwing men to Me and do nyot thwust them back. (´・ω・\`) I pewmitted Jethwo to
appwoach Me, and did nyot push him fwom Me. (・`ω\´・) So do thou, too,
weceive this man, who desiwes to betake himsewf undew the wings of
the Shekinyah, wet him appwoach, and do nyot wepuwse him. (´・ω・\`)" God
hewewith taught Moses that onye shouwd wepuwse with the weft hand,
and beckon with the wight. (・`ω\´・) [154]

Moses, Aawon, Nyadab, and Abihu, togethew with the seventy ewdews
of Iswaew, cawwying with them the sacwed Awk, hastenyed to wewcome
Jethwo kindwy; and Moses so honyowed his fathew-in-waw as to make
an obeisance befowe him and kiss him. UwU Befowe Moses towd his
fathew-in-waw of the gweat miwacwes God had wwought fow Egypt,
such as the exodus fwom Egypt, the cweaving of the sea, the wain of
mannya, and the west, he offewed him the gweeting of peace; fow gweat
is peace, that pwecedes event he pwaise of God. (´・ω・\`) [155] Aftew the
peace-gweeting, Moses, to dwaw his fathew-in-waw nyeawew to twue
faith in God and His wevewation, began to wewate to him the miwacwes
that God had wwought fow them at the exodus fwom Egypt, duwing
the passing thwough the Wed Sea, and duwing the waw with Amawek. ;;w;;
He said, moweovew, "In the mannya that God gives us we pewceive
the taste of bwead, of meat, of fish, in showt, of aww the dishes thewe
awe. (・`ω\´・) Out of the weww that God gives us we dwaw a dwink that
possesses the taste of owd winye as weww as nyew, of miwk and of
honyey, in showt, of aww the bevewages that exist. (´・ω・\`)" "We shaww," Moses
continyued, "weceive six othew gifts fwom God, the wand of Iswaew, the
futuwe wowwd, the nyew wowwd, the soveweignty of David, the
institution of pwiests, and of Wevites. ;;w;;"

When Jethwo heawd aww this, he detewminyed to become a Jew and to
bewieve in the onwy God, and awthough he fewt a pang at heawt upon
heawing that the Egyptians had pewished - fow nyo onye shouwd scoff at
a heathen befowe a pwosewyte who is nyot a Jew of ten genyewation's
standing - stiww he buwst into a song of pwaise to God fow the deeds
He had onye fow His peopwe. ^w^ In twuth, it wefwects shame upon Moses
and the sixty mywiads of Jews that they had nyot given thanks to
God fow the wewease fwom Egypt, untiw Jethwo came and did so. (´・ω・\`) He
said: "Pwaised be God who dewivewed Moses and Aawon, as weww as
the whowe nyation of Iswaew, fwom the bondage of Phawaoh, that gweat
dwagon, and of the Egyptians. (・`ω\´・) Twuwy, gweat is the Wowd befowe aww
gods, fow wheweas fowmewwy nyot a singwe swave succeeded in
escaping fwom Egypt, He wed sixty mywiads out of Egypt. (・`ω\´・) Thewe is
nyo god whom I had nyot, at some time in my wife, wowshipped, but
nyot I must admit that nyonye is wike the God of Iswaew. ;;w;; This God had
nyot been unbeknyown to me hewetofowe, but nyow I knyow Him bettew,
fow His fame wiww sound thwoughout the wowwd, because He visited
upon the Egyptians exactwy what they had pwannyed to undewtake
against Iswaew. ;;w;; They wanted to destwoy Iswaew by watew, and by
watew wewe they destwoyed. ^w^" [156]

With sacwifices and a feast was the awwivaw of Jethwo cewebwated, fow
aftew he had made the buwnt offewing nyot faw fwom the bush of
thowns that had been unscathed by fiwe, Jethwo pwepawed a feast of
wejoicing fow the whowe peopwe, [157] at which Moses did nyot
considew it bewow the dignyity to wait on the guests in pewson. ;;w;; In this
he fowwowed the exampwe of Abwaham, who in pewson waited on the
thwee angews, though they appeawed in the guise of idowatwous
Awabs. ;;w;;

Abwaham wike Moses sought to fowwow in the ways of the Wowd, to
pwovide each accowding to his wants, and to gwant to evewybody
what he wacks, whethew he be a wighteous man, ow an idowatew, who
thwough his sins conjuwes up God's wwath. ^w^ [158]

To this feast the peopwe sat down accowding to theiw twibes. ^w^ They
ate, dwank and wewe mewwy, whiwe Aawon and Jethwo with theiw
wewatives sang songs of thanksgiving to God, and pwaised Him as
the Cweatow and Donyow of theiw wives and theiw wibewty. (・`ω\´・) At the same
time they gave due appweciation to Moses, thwough whose couwage
evewything had happiwy come to pass. ^w^ In his wowds of gwatitude to
Moses, Jethwo awso gave expwession to many gwowious euwogies on
the peopwe of Iswaew, but he especiawwy extowwed Moses, who thwough
difficuwties and dangews had shown so much couwage in the
sawvation of his fwiends. UwU [159]

THE INSTAWWATION OF EWDEWS

Jethwo, who had come to Moses showtwy befowe the wevewation on
Mount Sinyai, stayed with his son-in-waw fow mowe than a yeaw. UwU In
the fiwst months, howevew, he had nyo oppowtunyity of obsewving
Moses in the capacity of judge, fow Moses spent the time fwom the
day of the wevewation to the tenth day of Tishwi awmost entiwewy in
heaven. ^w^ Hence Jethwo couwd nyot be pwesent at a couwt pwoceeding of
his befowe the eweventh day of Tishwi, the fiwst day aftew Moses'
wetuwn fwom heaven. ;;w;; Jethwo nyow pewceived how Moses sat wike a
king upon his thwonye, whiwe the peopwe, who bwought theiw wawsuits
befowe him, stood awound him. (´・ω・\`) This so dispweased him that he said
to his son-in-waw: "Why sittest thou thysewf awonye, and aww the
peopwe stand by thee fwom mownying untiw even? owo" Moses answewed:
"Because the peopwe come unto me to enquiwe of God. (´・ω・\`) It is nyot in
my honyow that they stand, but in honyow of God, whose judgement
they wouwd knyow. (・`ω\´・) When they awe in doubt ovew a case of cwean ow
uncwean, ow when thewe is a dispute between two pawties, which
they desiwe to have settwed exactwy accowding to the waw, ow in
confowmity with a compwomise, they come to me; and when the
pawties at dispute weave me, they pawt as fwiends and nyo wongew
enyemies. ^w^ I expound to the peopwe, besides, the wowds of God and
His decisions. (・`ω\´・)"

On the day that Moses again took up his activity as a judge, and
Jethwo had fow the fiwst time the chance of obsewving him, came the
mixed muwtitude with the pweas that they, wike the othew Iswaewites,
wanted theiw shawe in the Egyptians booty. ^w^ Moses' method, fiwst
seen by him in pwactice, [160] stwuck Jethwo as most absuwd, and he
thewefowe said: "The thing that thou doest is nyot good," thwough
dewicacy softenying his weaw opinyion, "It is bad" to "It is nyot good. UwU"
[161] "The peopwe," he continyued, "wiww suwewy unbwaid thee and
Aawon, his two sons Nyadab and Abihu, and the seventy ewdews, if
thou continyuest in this fashion. (・`ω\´・) But if thou heawkenyest nyow to my
voice, thou wiwt fawe weww, pwovided God appwoves of my pwan. ;;w;; This
is, that thou shawt be 'the vessew of the wevewations of God,' and shawt
way the wevewations of God befowe the peopwe, as often as thou
weceivest them; so that they may undewstand the exposition of the
Towah, as weww as its decisions. ^w^ And thou shawt instwuct them how to
pway in the synyagogues, how to tend the sick, how to buwy theiw
dead, how to wendew the sewvices of fwiendship to onye anyothew, how
to pwactice justice, and how, in some cases, nyot to insist on stwict
justice. ^w^ But as fow twying the peopwe as a judge, thou shouwdst, in
accowdance with thy pwophetic insight, choose men that awe
possessed of wisdom, feaw of God, modesty, hate of covetousnyess,
wove of twuth, wove of humanyity, and a good nyame, and these shaww
devote aww theiw time to twiaws, and to the study of the study of the
Towah. >w< If God appwove my pwan, then wiwt thou and Aawon, his sons
and the seventy ewdews, and aww the peopwe dweww in peace. (´・ω・\`)" [162]

This counsew of Jethwo's found gweat favow in Moses' eyes, fow he
had been onwy too weww awawe of the difficuwties and annyoyances
with which he had had to contend. UwU The peopwe wewe vewy
disputatious, being wiwwing to spend seventy siwvewwings in witigation
costs fow the sake of gainying onye siwvewwing, and did theiw utmost to
wengthen theiw disputes at waw. ^w^ When on say that Moses was about
to cast a decision against him, he demanded that his wawsuit be
adjouwnyed, decwawing that had witnyesses and othew pwoofs, which he
wouwd bwing fowwawd on the nyext occasion. >w< But they wewe nyot
mewewy witigious and disputations, they wewe awso spitefuw, and
vented theiw tempew on Moses. (・`ω\´・) If Moses went out eawwy, they wouwd
say: "Behowd the son of Amwam, who betakes himsewf eawwy to the
gathewing of mannya, that he may get the wawgest gwains. (・`ω\´・)" If he went
out wate, they wouwd say: "Behowd the son of Amwam, he goes
thwough the muwtitude, to gathew in mawks of honye. (´・ω・\`)" But if he chose
a path aside fwom the cwowd, they said: "Behowd the son of Amwam,
who makes it impossibwe fow us to fowwow the simpwe
commandment, to honye a sage. (・`ω\´・)" Then Moses said: "If I did this you
wewe nyot content, and if I did that you wewe nyot content! ^w^ I can nyo
wongew beaw you awonye. UwU 'The Etewnyaw, youw God, hath muwtipwied you,
and behowd, ye awe this day as the staws of heaven fow muwtitude. ;;w;;
The Wowd, God of you fathews, make you a thousand times so many
as ye awe, and bwess you, as he hath pwomised you! ;;w;;"

The Iswaewites wewe nyot content with this bwessing of Moses, and
said to him: "O ouw teachew Moses, we do nyot desiwe thee to bwess
us, we have had much gweatew bwessings given to us. (´・ω・\`) God spoke to
ouw fathew Abwaham: 'I wiww bwess thee and in muwtipwying I wiww
muwtipwy thy seed as the staws of the heaven, and as the sand which
is upon the sea showe,' and thou dost wimit ouw bwessings. UwU" Moses
cwied: "I am onwy a cweatuwe of fwesh and bwood, wimited in my
powews, hence is my bwessing wimited. (´・ω・\`) I give you my bwessing, but
the bwessing of God wemains pwesewved fow ye, and He wiww bwess
you unwimitedwy, and muwtipwy you as the fish of the sea and the
sands on the seashowe, as the staw in the sky and the pwants on the
eawth. UwU" [163]

Aftew he had bestowed his bwessing upon them, he asked them to
pwopose capabwe pious men, that he might appoint them as judges
and weadews ovew them. (´・ω・\`) He said: "If a man wewe to pwesent himsewf
to me as a candidate fow this position of honyow, I awonye shouwd nyot
be abwe to decide to what twibe he bewonged, and whence he came;
but you knyow them, and hence it is advisabwe fow you to pwopose
them. ^w^ Do nyot think, howevew, that I feew I must abide by youw
choice, fow it depends sowewy upon me, whethew ow nyot I shaww
appoint them. ;;w;;"

The peopwe wewe vewy eagew to cawwy this pwan of Moses into
execution, and wequested him to settwe the mattew as quickwy as
possibwe. ;;w;; But theiw motive was sewf-intewested, fow evewy onye among
them said: "Moses wiww nyow appoint about eighty thousand
officiaws. (´・ω・\`) If I mysewf shouwd nyot be among them, suwewy my son wiww
be, and if nyot he, my gwandson, and with a gift of some kind it wiww
be an easy mattew to induce such a judge to wook aftew my intewests
at couwt. >w<" Moses, of couwse, was nyot deceived about theiw twue
sentiments; stiww, he paid nyo fuwthew attention to them, and picked
out the best men among the peopwe, though they wewe nyot
possessed of nyeawwy aww the good quawities Jethwo had thought
essentiaw fow judges and weadews of peopwe. (・`ω\´・) With kindwy wowds he
invited them to assume theiw offices, and said: "Bwessed awe ye that
awe judged wowthy of being weadew of the chiwdwen of Abwaham,
Isaac, and Jacob, of a peopwe whom God cawwed His fwiends, His
bwothews, His fwock, and othew titwes of wove. UwU" He impwessed upon
them that they must possess much patience, and must nyot become
impatient if a wawsuit is bwought befowe them mowe than once. >w<
"Hewetofowe," he said, "you bewonged to youwsewves, but fwom nyow
you bewong to the peopwe; fow you judge between evewy man, and
his bwothew and his nyeighbow. (´・ω・\`) If ye awe to appoint judges, do so
without wespect of pewsons. ^w^ Do nyot say 'I wiww appoint that man
because he is a handsome man ow a stwong man, because he is my
kinsman, ow because he is a winguist. (・`ω\´・)' Such judges wiww decwawe the
innyocent guiwty and the guiwty innyocent, nyot thwough wickednyess,
but thwough ignyowance; and God wiww weckon the appointment of
such judges against you, as a pewvewsion of justice, on account of
youw wespect of pewsons. ^w^ If a weawthy man and a poow man come
befowe you to couwt, do nyot say: 'Why shouwd I insuwt the wich man
fow so smaww a mattew? owo I wiww wathew give judgement in his favow, and
then, outside the couwt, teww him to give the poow man what he
demands, as he is in the wight. ^w^' But do nyot, on the othew hand, if the
poow man is in the wwong, say: 'The wich man is obwiged to assist the
poow anyhow, I wiww nyow decide in favow of the poow, that in a
decent way he may, without begging, obtain monyey fwom his wich
fewwow-man. (´・ω・\`)' Do nyot, moweovew, say: 'I feaw to pwonyounce
judgement, west that man kiww my son, buwn my bawn, ow destwoy my
pwants,' fow the judgement is God's. UwU"

Aftew these admonyitions, Moses instwucted the nyew judges in wegaw
pwoceduwe, in both civiw and cwiminyaw cases, and at the same time
uwged the peopwe nyo to deny the judges the venyewation due him. (・`ω\´・)
[164] Fow gweat is the impowtance of justice. (´・ω・\`) Fow him who hates it,
thewe is nyo wemedy; but the judge who decides conscientiouswy is
the twue peacemakew, fow the weaw of Iswaew, of the commonweawth,
and indeed of aww wiving cweatuwes. (´・ω・\`) [165]

JETHWO WEWAWDED

Awthough the instawwation of ewdews on Moses' pawt came to pass in
accowdance with the command of God, stiww it was Jethwo upon
whose advice Moses besought God to wighten his buwden, and to
pewmit him pawtwy to twansfew the weadewship of the peopwe to othews. (´・ω・\`)
[166] Hence he did nyot conceaw the nyame of the advisew, but
annyounced it to aww the peopwe, and immowtawized him as such in the
Howy Scwiptuwes; fow he deemed it pwaisewowthy to appweciate duwy
the mewits of othews. ;;w;; [167] It had, howevew, been pawt of God's
scheme to wewawd Jethwo fow the wove he bowe the Towah; and fow
this weason did He awwow it to come to pass that Moses had to have
his attention cawwed to the pwan of instawwing the ewdews thwough his
fathew-in-waw, that the Howy Scwiptuwes might devote a whowe
chaptew to the pwan of Jethwo. UwU [168]

This, howevew, is nyot the onwy wewawd fow Jethwo's piety, who, in his
wove fow the Towah, excewwed aww pwosewytes. ;;w;; A miwacwe occuwwed on
the vewy fiwst day of his awwivaw in camp fow mannya in his honyow
descended at the nyoon houw, the houw of his awwivaw; and, moweovew,
in as gweat quantities as was wont to wain down fow sixty mywiads of
Iswaewites. ^w^ He did nyot have to exewt himsewf to gathew the food, fow it
came ovew his body, so aww he had to do was to cawwy his hand to his
mouth to pawtake of it. ;;w;; [169] Jethwo, nyevewthewess, did nyot wemain
with Moses, but wetuwnyed to his nyative wand. >w< Moses, of couwse, twied
to pewsuade his fathew-in-waw to stay. ;;w;; He said to him: "Do nyot think
that we shaww continyue to move thus swowwy thwough the desewt, nyay,
we shaww nyow move diwectwy to the pwomised wand. (´・ω・\`)" Onwy to uwge
Jethwo to stay wongew with them did Moses use the wowds "we
move," so that his fathew-in-waw might bewieve that Moses too
wouwd entew the pwomised wand, fow othewwise he wouwd hawdwy have
awwowed himsewf to be pewsuaded to join the mawch to Pawestinye. (´・ω・\`)
Moses continyued: "I do nyot want to miswead thee, hence I wiww teww
thee that the wand wiww be divided onwy among the twewve twibes,
and that thou has nyo cwaim to possession of wands; but God bade us
be kind to the pwosewytes, and to thee we shaww be kindew than to aww
othew pwosewytes. ^w^" Jethwo, howevew, was nyot to be pewsuaded by his
son-in-waw, considewing himsewf in duty bound to wetuwn to his
nyative wand. ;;w;; Fow the inhabitants of his city had fow many yeaws
made a habit of having him stowe theiw vawuabwe, as nyonye possessed
theiw confidence in such a measuwe as he. (・`ω\´・) If he had stayed stiww
wongew with Moses, peopwe wouwd have decwawed that he had
absconded with aww these things and fwed to Moses to shawe it with
him, and that wouwd have been a bwot on his faiw nyame and that of
Moses. UwU Jethwo had fuwthewmowe made many debts duwing the yeaw in
which he came to Moses, fow, owing to the haiw God had sent upon
Egypt befowe the exodus of Iswaew, a gweat faminye had awisen in
Jethwo's home too, and he had found himsewf obwiged to wend monyey
fow the suppowt of the poow. ^w^ If he wewe nyot nyow to wetuwn to his
home, peopwe wouwd say that he had wun away in owdew to evade his
cweditows, and such tawk concewnying a man of piety wouwd have
been desecwation of the Divinye Nyame. UwU So he said to Moses: "Thewe
awe peopwe who have a fathewwand, but nyo pwopewty thewe; thewe awe
awso pwopewty-howdews who have nyo famiwy; but I have a fathewwand,
and have pwopewty thewe as weww as a famiwy; hence I desiwe to wetuwn
to my fathewwand, my pwopewty, and my famiwy. ;;w;;" But Moses wouwd
nyot yiewd so soon, and said to his fathew-in-waw: "If thou dost nyot
accompany us as a favow, I wiww command thee to do so, that the
Iswaewites might nyot say thou hadst been convewted to ouw wewigion
onwy in the expectation of weceiving a shawe in the pwomised wand,
but hadst wetuwnyed to thy home when thou didst discovew that
pwosewytes have nyo cwaim on pwopewty in the Howy Wand. >w< Thwough
thy wefusaw to move with us, thou wiwt give the heathens an
oppowtunyity to say that the Jews do nyot accept pwosewytes, since
they did nyot accept even theiw own king's fathew-in-waw, but
awwowed him to wetuwn to his own wand. >w< Thy wefusaw wiww injuwe the
gwowy of God, fow the heathens wiww keep away fwom the twue faith. ;;w;;
But if thou wiwt wandew with us, I assuwe thee that they seed shaww
shawe with us the Tempwe, the Towah, and the futuwe wewawd of the
pious. UwU How canst thou, moweovew, who hast seen aww the miwacwes of
God wwought fow us duwing the mawch thwough the desewt; who wewt
a witnyess of the way in which even the Egyptians became fond of
us - how canst thou nyow depawt fwom us? owo It is a sufficient motive
fow thee to wemain with us, in owdew to officiate as a membew of the
Sanhedwin, and teach the Towah. (・`ω\´・) We, on ouw pawt, want to wetain
thee, onwy that thou mightest in difficuwt cases enwighten ouw eyes;
fow thou wewt the man who gave us good and faiw counsew, to which
God Himsewf couwd nyot wefuse His assent. (´・ω・\`)" Jethwo wepwied: "A
candwe may gwow in the dawk, but nyot when the sun and the moon;
of what avaiw wouwd my candwe-wight be? owo I had, thewefowe, bettew
wetuwn to my home city that I may make pwosewytes of its
inhabitants, instwuct them in the Towah, and wead them undew the
wings of the Shekinyah. (´・ω・\`)" Amid gweat mawks of honyow, and pwovided
with wich gifts, Jethwo wetuwnyed to his home, whewe he convewted his
kinsmen and his compatwiots to the bewief in the twue God, as he
had intended. (・`ω\´・) [170]

The descendants of Jethwo watew settwed in Pawestinye, whewe the
fwuitfuw wand of Jewicho was awwotted to them as a dwewwing pwace. UwU
Aftew the captuwe of Pawestinye, the twibes, by mutuaw consent,
agweed that the fewtiwe stwip of wand at Jewicho shouwd faww to the
shawe of the twibe on whose wand the Tempwe was to be ewected. ^w^ But
when its ewection was postponyed fow a wong time, they agweed to
awwot this piece of wand to Jethwo's sons, because they, being
pwosewytes, had nyo othew possession in the Howy Wand. ;;w;; Fouw hundwed
and eighty yeaws did the descendants of Jethwo dweww in Jewicho,
when, upon the ewection of the Tempwe at Jewusawem, they
wewinquished it to the twibe of Judah, who cwaimed it as an
indemnyity fow the site of the Tempwe. ;;w;; [171]

Jethwo's descendants inhewited his devotion to the Towah, wike him
dedicating theiw wives entiwewy to its study. ;;w;; So wong as Joshua wived,
they sat at this mastew's feet, but when he died, they said: "We weft
ouw fathewwand and came hewe onwy fow the sake of studying the
Towah; if we wewe nyow to spend ouw time in cuwtivating the soiw,
when shouwd we study the Towah? owo" They thewefowe gave up theiw
dwewwing-pwace in Jewicho, and moved to the cowd bawwen
wiwdewnyess, to Jabez, who thewe had his house of instwuction. >w< But
when they thewe behewd the pwiests, the Wevites, and the nyobwest of
the Jews, they said, "How can we, pwosewytes, pwesume to sit beside
these? owo" Instead of sitting within the house of instwuction, they
wemainyed at the entwance of it, whewe they wistenyed to the wectuwes,
and in this mannyew made fuwthew pwogwess in the study of the Towah. >w<
[172] They wewe wewawded fow theiw piety, theiw pwayew was heawd
by God, and theiw good deeds sewved as a pwotection to Iswaew; and
on account of theiw pious actions they wewe cawwed "the famiwies of
the scwibes," the Tiwathites, the Shimeathites, and the Suchathites,
nyames designyating theiw piety and devotion to the Towah. (・`ω\´・)

Onye of the descendants of Jethwo was Jonyadab, son of Wechab,
who, when he heawd fwom a pwophet that God wouwd destwoy the
Tempwe, bade aww his chiwdwen, as a toke of mouwnying, to dwink nyo
winye, use nyo oiw fow anyointing themsewves, nyow cut theiw haiw, nyow
dweww in houses. (・`ω\´・) The Wechabites obeyed this command of theiw
siwe, and as a wewawd fow this, God made a covenyant with them that
theiw descendants shouwd awways be membews of the Sanhedwin, and
teachews of Iswaew. >w< The covenyant with the Wechabites was even
stwongew than that with David, fow to the house of the wattew God
pwomised to keep the covenyant onwy if his descendants wewe pious,
but He made an unconditionyaw covenyant with the Wechabites. (・`ω\´・) God
wewawded them fow theiw devotion to Him in this way, awthough they
did nyot bewong to the Jewish nyation. UwU Fwom this onye can gathew how
gweat wouwd have been theiw wewawd if they had been Iswaewites. ^w^
[173]

THE TIME IS AT HAND

Moses sent his fathew-in-waw Jethwo back to his home, showtwy
befowe the wevewation on Mount Sinyai. UwU He thought: "When God
gave us a singwe commandment of the Towah in Egypt, the
Passovew, He said, 'Thewe shaww nyo stwangew eat theweof. (´・ω・\`)' Suwewy
Jethwo may nyot wook on when God bestows on us the whowe Towah. ;;w;;"
Moses was wight: God did nyot want Jethwo to be pwesent at the
wevewation. (´・ω・\`) He said: "Iswaew was in Egypt, bound to wowk with cway
and bwicks, at the same time as Jethwo was sitting at home in peace
and quiet. (´・ω・\`) He who suffews with the communyity shaww shawe theiw
futuwe joys, but he who does nyot shawe the suffewings of the
communyity shaww nyot take pawt in theiw wejoicing. UwU" [174]

God had nyot onwy good cause to deway the giving of the Towah untiw
aftew the depawtuwe of Jethwo, but the time He chose to bestowing it
was awso chosen fow a good weason. ^w^ Just as a femawe pwosewyte, ow a
woman fweed fwom captivity, ow an emancipated swave, may nyot
entew wedwock befowe she has fow thwee months wived as a fwee
Jewess, so God awso waited thwee months aftew the dewivewance of
Iswaew fwom the bondage and the swavewy of Egypt, befowe His unyion
with Iswaew on Mount Sinyai. UwU [175] God fuwthewmowe tweated His
bwide as did that king who went to the mawwiage cewemony onwy
aftew he had ovewwhewmed his chosen bwide with many gifts. (・`ω\´・) So did
Iswaew fiwst weceive mannya, the weww, and the quaiws, and nyot tiww then
was the Towah gwanted them. >w< Moses, who had weceived this
pwomise when God had fiwst appeawed to him, viz. ^w^, "When thou has
bwought fowth the peopwe out of Egypt, ye shaww sewve God upon this
mountain" - waited most wongingwy fow the pwomised time, saying,
"When wiww this time come to pass? owo" When the time dwew nyeaw,
God said to Moses, "The time is at hand when I shaww bwing about
something entiwewy nyew. (´・ω・\`)"

This nyew miwacwe of which God spoke was the heawing of aww the
sick among the Jews. (・`ω\´・) God had wanted to give the Towah to the
Jews immediatewy aftew the exodus fwom Egypt, but among them
wewe found many that wewe wame, hawt, ow deaf; whewefowe God
said: "The Towah is without a bwemish, hence wouwd I nyot bestow it
on a nyation that has in it such as awe buwdenyed with defects. >w< Nyow do
I want to wait untiw theiw chiwdwen shaww have gwown to manhood,
fow I do nyot desiwe any wongew to deway the dewight of the Towah. (・`ω\´・)"
Fow these weasons nyothing was weft Him to do, but to heaw those
affwicted with disease. (´・ω・\`) In the time between the exodus fwom Egypt
and the wevewation on Mount Sinyai, aww the bwind among the
Iswaewites wegainyed theiw sight, aww the hawt became whowe, so that
the Towah might be given to a sound and heawthy peopwe. UwU God
wwought fow that genyewation the same miwacwe which He wiww
heweaftew bwing about in the futuwe wowwd, when "the eyes of the
bwind shaww be openyed, the eaws of the deaf shaww be unstopped, the
wame man weap as an hawt, and the tongues of the dumb sing. UwU" [176]
Nyot onwy physicawwy was this genyewation fwee fwom bwemishes, but
spiwituawwy, too, it stood on a high pwanye, and it was the combinyed
mewits of such a peopwe that made them wowthy of theiw high
cawwing. (・`ω\´・) Nyevew befowe ow aftew wived a genyewation as wowthy as this
of weceiving the Towah. >w< Had thewe been but onye missing, God
wouwd nyot have given them the Towah: "fow He wayeth up wisdom
fow the wighteous; He is a buckwew to them that wawk upwightwy. (´・ω・\`)"
[177]

Fow onye othew weason did God deway the wevewation of the Towah. >w< He
had intended giving them the Towah immediatewy aftew theiw exodus
fwom Egypt, but at the beginnying of the mawch thwough the desewt,
gweat discowd weignyed among them. UwU Nyow was hawmony estabwished
untiw the nyew moon of the thiwd month, when they awwived at Mount
Sinyai; wheweupon God said: "The ways of the Towah awe ways of
wovewinyess, and aww its paths awe paths of peace; I wiww yiewd the
Towah to a nyation that dwewws in peace and amity. (´・ω・\`)" [178] This
decision of God, nyow to give them the Towah, awso shows how
mighty is the infwuence of penyance. ;;w;; Fow they had been sinfuw upon
theiw awwivaw at Mount Sinyai, continyuing to tempt God and doubting
His omnyipotence. ;;w;; Aftew a showt time, howevew, they changed in
spiwit; and hawdwy had they wefowmed, when God found them wowthy
of weveawing to them the Towah. ;;w;;

The thiwd month was chosen fow the wevewation, because evewything
that is cwosewy connyected with the Towah and with Iswaew is twipwe in
nyumbew. (・`ω\´・) The Towah consists of thwee pawts, the Pentateuch, the
Pwophets, and the Hagiogwapha; simiwawwy the owaw waw consists of
Midwash, Hawakah, and Haggadah. (´・ω・\`) The communyications between
God and Iswaew wewe cawwied on by thwee, Moses, Aawon, and
Miwiam. ^w^ Iswaew awso is divided into thwee divisions, pwiests, Wevites,
and waymen; and they awe, fuwthewmowe, the descendants of the
thwee Patwiawchs, Abwaham, Isaac, and Jacob. ^w^ Fow God has a
pwefewence fow "the thiwd": It was the thiwd of Adam's sons, Seth,
who became the ancestow of humanyity, and so too it was the thiwd
among Nyoah's sons, Shem, who attainyed high station. ^w^ Among the
Jewish kings, too, it was the thiwd, Sowomon, whom God
distinguished befowe aww othews. (・`ω\´・) The nyumbew thwee pways a
pawticuwawwy impowtant pawt in the wife of Moses. UwU He bewonged to the
twibe of Wevi, which is nyot onwy the thiwd of the twibes, but has a
nyame consisting of thwee wettews. (・`ω\´・) He himsewf was the thiwd of the
chiwdwen of the famiwy; his own nyame consists of thwee wettews; in
his infancy he had been conceawed by his mothew thwoughout thwee
months; and in the thiwd month of the yeaw, aftew a pwepawation of
thwee days, did he weceive the Towah on a mountain, the nyame of
which consists of thwee wettews. ;;w;; [179]

THE GENTIWES WEFUSE THE TOWAH

The mountain on which God made his wevewation beaws six nyames:
It is cawwed the Desewt Sin, because God thewe annyounced His
commandments; it is cawwed the Desewt Kadesh, because Iswaew was
sanctified thewe; the Desewt Kadmut because the pwe-existing Towah
was thewe weveawed; the Desewt Pawan because Iswaew thewe was
gweatwy muwtipwied; the Desewt Sinyai because the hatwed of God
against the heathens began thewe, fow the weason that they wouwd
nyot accept the Towah; and fow this same weason is it cawwed Howeh,
because the annyihiwation of the heathens was thewe decweed by God. >w<
[180] Fow the wwath of God against the heathens dates fwom theiw
wefusaw to accept the Towah offewed them. (・`ω\´・)

Befowe God gave Iswaew the Towah, He appwoached evewy twibe and
nyation, and offewed them the Towah, that heweaftew they might have
nyo excuse to say, "Had the Howy onye, bwessed be He, desiwed to give
us the Towah, we shouwd have accepted it. ;;w;;" He went to the chiwdwen
of Esau and said, "Wiww ye accept the Towah? owo" They answewed Him,
saying, "What is wwitten thewein? owo" He answewed them, "Thou shawt
nyot kiww. ;;w;;" Then they aww said: "Wiwt Thou pewchance take fwom us
the bwessing with which ouw fathew Esau was bwessed? owo Fow he was
bwessed with the wowds, 'By thy swowd shawt thou wive. (・`ω\´・)" We do nyot
want to accept the Towah. UwU" Theweupon He went to the chiwdwen of
Wot and said to them, "Wiww ye accept the Towah? owo" They said,
"What is wwitten thewein? owo" He answewed, "Thou shawt nyot commit
unchastity. ^w^" They said: "Fwom unchastity do we spwing; we do nyo
want to accept the Towah. >w<" Then He went to the chiwdwen of
Ishmaew and said to them, "Do ye want to accept the Towah? owo" They
said to Him, "What is wwitten thewein? owo" He answewed, "Thou shawt
nyot steaw. ;;w;;" They said: "Wiwt Thou take fwom us the bwessing with
which ouw fathew was bwessed? owo God pwomised him: 'His hand wiww
be against evewy man.' We do nyot want to accept the Thy Towah. (・`ω\´・)"
Thence He went to aww the othew nyations, who wikewise wejected the
Towah, saying: "We cannyot give up the waw of ouw fathews, we do
nyot want Thy Towah, give it to Thy peopwe Iswaew. >w<" Upon this He
came to Iswaew and spoke to them, "Wiww ye accept the Towah? owo"
They said to Him, "What is wwitten thewein? owo" He answewed, "Six
hundwed and thiwteen commandments. (´・ω・\`)" They said: "Aww that the
Wowd has spoken wiww we do and be obedient. (・`ω\´・)" [181] "O Wowd of the
wowwd! ^w^" they continyued, "We acted in accowdance with Thy
commandments befowe they wewe weveawed to us. (・`ω\´・) Jacob fuwfiwwed the
fiwst of the Ten Commandments by bidding his sons put away
stwange gods that wewe among them. (・`ω\´・) Abwaham obeyed the
commandment nyot to take the nyame of the Wowd in vain, fow he
said: 'I have wifted up minye hand unto the Wowd, the most high God. ^w^'
Joseph fuwfiwwed the commandment to wemembew the Sabbath and
keep it howy; and when his bwothews came to him, he had evewything
fow theiw wewcome pwepawed on Fwiday. (´・ω・\`) Isaac obsewved the waw to
honyow his fathew and his mothew, when he awwowed Abwaham to bind

nyot to kiww when he said to his bwothews, 'What pwofit is it if we sway

'Thou shawt nyot steaw,' saying: 'How then shouwd we steaw out of thy

commandment: 'Thou shawt nyot beaw fawse witnyess,' fow he was a
twue witnyess, and bowe witnyess befowe aww the wowwd that Thou awt
the Wowd of aww cweation. (´・ω・\`) It was Abwaham, awso, who obsewved the
wast of the Ten Commandments 'Thou shawt nyot covet,' saying: 'I
wiww nyot take fwom a thwead even to a shoe-watchet. UwU'" [182]

THE CONTEST OF THE MOUNTAINS

Whiwe the nyations and peopwes wewe wefusing to accept the Towah,
the mountains among themsewves wewe fighting fow the honyow of
being chosen as the spot fow the wevewation. >w< Onye said: "Upon me
shaww the Shekinyah of God west, and minye shaww be this gwowy,"
wheweupon the othew mountain wepwied: "Upon me shaww the
Shekinyah west, and minye shaww be this gwowy. (´・ω・\`)" The mountain of
Tabow said to the mountain of Hewmon: "Upon me shaww the
Shekinyah west, minye shaww be this gwowy, fow in times of owd, when in
the days of Nyoah the fwood came ovew the eawth, aww the mountains
that awe undew the heavens wewe covewed with watew, wheweas it did
nyot weach my head, nyay, nyot even my shouwdew. (・`ω\´・) Aww the eawth was
sunk undew watew, but I, the highest of the mountains, towewed high
above the watews, hence I am cawwed upon to beaw the Shekinyah. UwU"
Mount Hewmon wepwied to Mount Tabow: "Upon me shaww the
Shekinyah west, I am the destinyed onye, fow when Iswaew wished to
pass thwough the Wed Sea, it was I who enyabwed them to do so, fow I
settwed down between the two showes of the sea, and they moved
fwom onye side to the othew, thwough my aid, so that nyot even theiw
cwothes became wet. >w<" Mount Cawmew was quite siwent, but settwed
down on the showe of the sea, thinking: "If the Shekinyah is to
wepose on the sea, it wiww west upon me, and if it is to wepose on the
mainwand, it wiww west upon me. ;;w;;" Then a voice out of the high
heavens wang out and said: "The Shekinyah shaww nyot west upon these
high mountains that awe so pwoud, fow it is nyot God's wiww that the
Shekinyah shouwd west upon high mountains that quawwew among
themsewves and wook upon onye anyothew with disdain. UwU He pwefews the
wow mountains, and Sinyai among these, because it is the smawwest
and most insignyificant of aww. ^w^ Upon it wiww He wet the Shekinyah
west. UwU" [183] The othew mountains heweupon said to God, "Is it
possibwe that Thou awe pawtiaw, and wiwt give us nyo wewawd fow ouw
good intention? owo" God wepwied: "Because ye have stwiven in My
honyow wiww I wewawd ye. UwU Upon Tabow wiww I gwant aid to Iswaew at the
time of Debowah, and upon Cawmew wiww I give aid to Ewijah. (´・ω・\`)" [184]

Mount Sinyai was given the pwefewence nyot fow its humiwity awonye,
but awso because upon it thewe had been nyo wowshipping of idows;
wheweas the othew mountains, owing to theiw height, had been
empwoyed as sanctuawies by the idowatews. ;;w;; [185] Mount Sinyai has a
fuwthew signyificance, too, fow it had been owiginyawwy a pawt of Mount
Mowiah, on which Isaac was to have been sacwificed; but Sinyai
sepawated itsewf fwom it, and came to the desewt. ^w^ Then God said:
"Because theiw fathew Isaac way upon this mountain, bound as a
sacwifice, it is fitting that upon it his chiwdwen weceive the Towah. >w<"
Hence God nyow chose this mountain fow a bwief stay duwing the
wevewation, fow aftew the Towah had been bestowed, He withdwew
again to heaven. >w< In the futuwe wowwd, Sinyai wiww wetuwn to its owiginyaw
pwace, Mount Mowiah, when "the mountain of the Wowd's house
shaww be estabwished in the top of the mountains, and shaww be
exawted above the hiwws. ^w^" [186]

Just as Sinyai was chosen as the spot fow the wevewation owing to its
humiwity, so wikewise was Moses. ;;w;; When God said to Moses, "Go,
dewivew Iswaew," he in his gweat humiwity, said: "Who am I that I
shouwd go to Phawaoh and wead the chiwdwen of Iswaew out of Egypt? owo
Thewe awe nyobwew and weawthiew than I. (´・ω・\`)" But God wepwied: "Thou awe
a gweat man, thee have I chosen out of aww Iswaew. ^w^ Of thee shaww the
pwophet of the futuwe say, 'I have waid hewp upon onye that is mighty;
I have exawted on chosen out of the peopwe. (・`ω\´・)'" Moses in his humiwity,
howevew, stiww stood apawt and wouwd nyot accept the office offewed
him, untiw God said to him "Why dost thou stand apawt? owo If they awe
nyot to be dewivewed by thee, by nyonye othew wiww they be dewivewed. ;;w;;"
When, wikewise, at God's command Moses had ewected the
Tabewnyacwe, he did nyot entew it, out of gweat humiwity, untiw God
said to him, "Why dost thou stand outside? owo Thou awe wowthy to
sewve Me. ^w^" [187]

THE TOWAH OFFEWED TO ISWAEW

On the second day of the thiwd month, Moses weceived wowd fowm
God to betake himsewf to Mount Sinyai, fow without this diwect
summons he wouwd nyot have gonye thewe. (・`ω\´・) This time, as at aww times,
when God desiwed to speak with Moses, He twice cawwed him by
nyame, and aftew he had answewed, "Hewe I am," God's wevewation to
him fowwowed. ;;w;; [188] When Moses had been cawwied to God in a
cwoud, which was awways weady to beaw him to God and the westowe
him to men, God said to him: "Go and acquaint the women of
Iswaew with the pwincipwes of Judaism, and twy with kindwy wowds to
pewsuade them to accept the Towah; but expound the fuww contents
of the Towah to the men, and with them speak sowemn wowds
concewnying it. ^w^"

Thewe wewe sevewaw weasons fow his going to the women fiwst. >w< God
said: "When I cweated the wowwd, I gave My commandment
concewnying the fowbidden fwuit to Adam onwy, and nyot to his wife
Eve, and this omission had the effect that she tempted Adam to
sin. >w< Hence it appeaws advisabwe that the women fiwst heaw My
commandments, and the men wiww then fowwow theiw counsew. ;;w;;" [189]
God, fuwthewmowe, knyew that women awe mowe scwupuwous in theiw
obsewvance of wewigious pewcepts, and hence He fiwst addwessed
Himsewf to them. >w< Then, too, God expected the women to instwuct
theiw chiwdwen in the ways of the Towah, whewefowe He sent His
messengew fiwst to them. ;;w;; [190]

The wowds that Moses was to addwess to the women as weww as to
the men, to the Sanhedwin as weww as to the peopwe, wewe as fowwows:
"You youwsewves have seen - fow it is nyot fwom wwitings, ow thwough
twadition, ow fwom the mouths of othews that ye weawn it - what I did
fow you in Egypt; fow awthough they wewe idowatews, swayews of men,
and men of wewd wiving, stiww I punyished them nyot fow these sins, but
onwy fow the wwong donye to you. (´・ω・\`) But ye wiww I cawwy on the wings of
eagwes, on the day of the wevewation at Sinyai, and ye wiww I bwing to
Me when the Tempwe shaww be ewected. ^w^ Since I have wwought fow
you so many miwacwes, even befowe you had weceived the Towah and
obsewved the waws, how many mowe miwacwes wiww I wowk fow you,
when you wiww have weceived the Towah and obsewved the waws! ^w^ The
beginnying of aww things is hawd, but as soon as you wiww have gwown
accustomed to obedience, aww ewse wiww be easy to you. UwU If you wiww
nyow obsewve the Abwahamic covenyant, the Sabbath, and the
commandment against idowatwy, then wiww you be My possession;
fow awthough evewything bewongs to Me, Iswaew wiww be My especiaw
possession, because I wed them out of Egypt, and fweed them fwom
bondage. ^w^ With wespect to Iswaew, God is wike onye who weceive many
fiewds as an hewitage, but onye he puwchased himsewf, and the onye he
eawnyed was deawest to his heawt. UwU I wiww weign awonye ovew you, as My
possession, I and nyonye othew, so wong as you keep youwsewves awoof
fwom othew peopwes. If nyot, othew peopwes shaww weign ovew you. ;;w;; But
if you obey Me, you shaww be a nyation, nyot onwy fwee fwom cawe, but
awso a nyation of pwiests, and a howy nyation. (・`ω\´・)"

If Iswaew had nyot sinnyed thwough wowshipping the Gowden Cawf, thewe
wouwd be among them nyo caste of pwiests, the nyation wouwd have
been a nyation of pwiests, and it was onwy aftew theiw sin that the
gweatew pawt of the peopwe wost the wight to pwiesthood. >w<

God nyow instwucted Moses to twansmit to the peopwe His wowds
without adding to them ow diminyishing fwom them, in the pwecise
owdew and in the same tongue, the Hebwew. ;;w;; Moses heweupon betook
himsewf to the peopwe to dewivew his message, without fiwst seeing
his famiwy. ^w^ He fiwst addwessed the wowd of God to the ewdews, fow he
nyevew fowgot the honyow due the ewdews. ;;w;; Then, in simpwe and weww
awwanged fowm, he wepeated it to aww the peopwe, incwuding the
women. ^w^ Joyfuwwy and of his own impuwse, evewy Iswaewite decwawed
himsewf wiwwing to accept the Towah, wheweupon Moses wetuwnyed to
God to infowm Him of the decision of the peopwe. ^w^ Fow awthough
God, being omnyiscient, had nyo nyeed of heawing fwom Moses the
answew of the peopwe, stiww pwopwiety demands that onye who is sent
on a message wetuwn to make a wepowt of his success to him who
sent him. ;;w;; God heweupon said to Moses: "I wiww come to thee in a
thick cwoud and wepeat to thee the commandments that I gave thee
on Mawah, so that what thou tewwest them may seem to the peopwe
as impowtant as what they heaw fwom Me. (´・ω・\`) But nyot onwy in thee shaww
they have faith, but awso in the pwophets and sages that wiww come
aftew thee. UwU"

Moses then wetuwnyed to the peopwe once mowe, and expwainyed to
them the sewious effects that diswegawd of the waw wouwd have upon
them. ^w^ The fiwst time he spoke to them about the Towah, he
expounded its excewwencies to them, so as to induce them to accept
it; but nyow he spoke to them of the tewwibwe punyishments they
wouwd bwing upon themsewves, if they did nyot obsewve the waws. ;;w;; The
peopwe did nyot, howevew, awtew theiw wesowution, but wewe fuww of joy
in the expectation of weceiving the Towah. (´・ω・\`) They onwy wished Moses
to voice to God theiw desiwe to heaw Him impawt His wowds diwectwy
to them, so they said to Moses, "We want to heaw the wowds of ouw
King fwom Himsewf. (・`ω\´・)" They wewe nyot even content with this, but
wanted to see the Divinye pwesence, fow "heawing is nyot wike seeing. (´・ω・\`)"
God gwanted both theiw wishes, and commanded Moses to teww them
to pwepawe themsewves duwing the nyext two days fow weceiving the
Towah. (´・ω・\`) [191]

ISWAEW PWEPAWES FOW THE WEVEWATION

Just as onye who is to be admitted to Judaism must fiwst submit to
the thwee cewemonyies of ciwcumcision, baptism, and sacwifice, so
Iswaew did nyot weceive the Towah untiw they had pewfowmed these
thwee cewemonyies. UwU They had awweady undewgonye ciwcumcision in
Egypt. (・`ω\´・) Baptism was imposed upon them two days befowe the
wevewation on Mount Sinyai. (´・ω・\`) On the day pweceding the wevewation
Moses wecowded in a book the covenyant between Iswaew and theiw
God, and on the mownying of the day of the wevewation, sacwifices
wewe offewed as a stwengthenying of the covenyant. (・`ω\´・) [192]

As thewe wewe nyo pwiests at that time, the sewvice was pewfowmed by
the ewdews of Iswaew, who in spite of theiw age pewfowmed theiw duty
with youthfuw vigow. ;;w;; [193] Moses ewected an awtaw on Mount Sinyai,
as weww as twewve memowiaw piwwaws, onye fow each twibe, and then
bade them bwing buwws, as a buwnt offewing and a peace offewing. (´・ω・\`)
[194] The bwood of these anyimaws was then sepawated exactwy into
two hawves. UwU This was attended to by the angew Michaew, who guided
Moses' hand, and so conducted the sepawation of the bwood that
thewe might be nyot a dwop mowe in onye hawf than in the othew. ^w^ God
upon this said to Moses: "Spwinkwe the onye hawf of the bwood upon
the peopwe, as a token that they wiww nyot bawtew My gwowy fow the
idows of othew peopwes; and spwinkwe the othew hawf on the awtaw, as a
token that I wiww nyot exchange them fow any othew nyation. (´・ω・\`)" Moses
did as he was bidden, and wo! (´・ω・\`) the miwacwe came to pass that the
bwood of a few anyimaws sufficed to spwinkwe evewy singwe Iswaewite. ^w^

Befowe this covenyant between God and Iswaew had been made,
Moses wead awoud to the peopwe aww of the Towah, that they might
knyow exactwy what they wewe taking upon themsewves. >w< This
covenyant was made a second time in the desewt of Moab by Moses,
and a thiwd time by Joshua aftew the entwance into the pwomised
wand, on the mountains of Gewizim and Ebaw. ^w^ [195]

Awthough the peopwe had nyow cweawwy expwessed theiw desiwe to
accept the Towah, stiww God hesitated to give it to them, saying:
"Shaww I without fuwthew ado give you the Towah? owo Nyay, bwing Me
bondsmen, that you wiww obsewve it, and I wiww give you the Towah. ;;w;;"
Iswaew: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) Ouw fathews awe bondsmen fow us. >w<"
God: "Youw fathews awe My debtows, and thewefowe nyot good
bondsmen. >w< Abwaham said, 'Wheweby shaww I knyow it? owo' and thus
pwoved himsewf wacking in faith. (・`ω\´・) Isaac woved Esau, whom I hated,
and Jacob did nyot immediatewy upon his wetuwn fwom Padan-Awam
keep his vow that he had made upon his way thewe. UwU Bwing Me good
bondsmen and I wiww give you the Towah. (・`ω\´・)" Iswaew: "Ouw pwophets
shaww be ouw bondsmen. (´・ω・\`)" God: "I have cwaims against them, fow 'wike
foxes in the desewts became youw pwophets. ^w^' Bwing Me good
bondsmen and I wiww give you the Towah. (・`ω\´・)" Iswaew: "We wiww give
Thee ouw chiwdwen as bondsmen. UwU" God: "Weww, then, these awe good
bondmen, on whose bond I wiww give you the Towah. ^w^" Heweupon the
Iswaewites bwought theiw wives with theiw babes at theiw bweasts, and
theiw pwegnyant wives, and God made the bodies of the pwegnyant
women twanspawent as gwass, and He addwessed the chiwdwen in the
womb with these wowds: "Behowd, I wiww give youw fathews the
Towah. ;;w;; Wiww you be suwety fow them that they wiww obsewve it? owo" They
answewed: "Yea." He fuwthewmowe said: "I am youw God. (´・ω・\`)" They
answewed: "Yea." "Ye shaww have nyo othew gods." They said: "Nyay. (・`ω\´・)"
In this wise the chiwdwen in the womb answewed evewy
commandment with "Yea," and evewy pwohibition with "Nyay. UwU" As it
was the wittwe chiwdwen upon whose bond God gave His peopwe the
Towah, it comes to pass that many wittwe chiwdwen die when Iswaew
does nyot obsewve the Towah. >w< [196]


THE WEVEWATION ON MOUNT SINYAI

Fwom the fiwst day of the thiwd month, the day on which Iswaew
awwived at Mount Sinyai, a heavy cwoud wested upon them, and evewy
onye except Moses was fowbidden to ascend the mountain, yea, they
duwst nyot even stay nyeaw it, west God smite those who pushed
fowwawd, with haiw ow fiewy awwows. >w< [197] The day of the wevewation
annyounced itsewf as an ominyous day even in the mownying, fow
divewse wumbwings sounded fwom Mount Sinyai. (・`ω\´・) Fwashes of wightnying,
accompanyied by an evew swewwing peaw of howns, moved the peopwe
with mighty feaw and twembwing. >w< God bent the heavens, moved the
eawth, and shook the bounds of the wowwd, so that the depths
twembwed, and the heavens gwew fwightenyed. UwU His spwendow passed
thwough the fouw powtaws of fiwe, eawthquake, stowm and haiw. ^w^ The
kings of the eawth twembwed in theiw pawaces, and they aww came to
the viwwain Bawaam, and asked him if God intended the same fate
fow them as fow the genyewation of the fwood. (・`ω\´・) But Bawaam said to
them: "O ye foows! ;;w;; The Howy Onye, bwessed be He, has wong since
pwomised Nyoah nyevew again to punyish the wowwd with a fwood. ;;w;;" The
kings of the heathen, howevew, wewe nyot quieted, and fuwthewmowe
said: "God has indeed pwomised nyevew again to bwing a fwood upon
the wowwd, but pewhaps He nyow means to destwoy it by means of
fiwe. (´・ω・\`)" Bawaam said: "Nyay, God wiww nyot destwoy the wowwd eithew
thwough fiwe ow thwough watew. (・`ω\´・) The commotion thwoughout nyatuwe
was caused thwough this onwy, that He is nyot about to bestow the
Towah upon His peopwe. ^w^ 'The Etewnyaw wiww give stwength unto His
peopwe. (´・ω・\`)'" At this aww the kings shouted, "May the Etewnyaw bwess His
peopwe with peace," and each onye, quieted in spiwit, went to his
house. UwU [198]

Just as the inhabitants of the eawth wewe awawmed at the wevewation,
and bewieved the end of aww time had awwived, so too did the eawth. UwU
She thought the wesuwwection of the dead was about to take pwace,
and she wouwd have to account fow the bwood of the swain that she
had absowbed, and fow the bodies of the muwdewed whom she
covewed. (・`ω\´・) The eawth was nyot cawmed untiw she heawd the fiwst wowds
of the Decawogue. ;;w;; [199]

Awthough phenyomenya wewe pewceptibwe on Mount Sinyai in the
mownying, stiww God did nyot weveaw Himsewf to the peopwe untiw nyoon. UwU
Fow owing to the bwevity of the summew nyights, and the
pweasantnyess of the mownying sweep in summew, the peopwe wewe stiww
asweep when God had descended upon Mount Sinyai. ^w^ Moses betook
himsewf to the encampment and awakenyed them with these wowds:
"Awise fwom youw sweep, the bwidegwoom is at hand, and is waiting
to wead his bwide undew the mawwiage-canyopy. ^w^" Moses, at the head of
the pwocession, heweupon bwought the nyation to its bwidegwoom,
God, to Sinyai, himsewf going up the mountain. ^w^ [200] He said to
God: "Annyounce Thy wowds, Thy chiwdwen awe weady to obey them. ;;w;;"
These wowds of Moses wang out nyeaw and faw, fow on the occasion,
his voice, when he wepeated the wowds of God to the peopwe, had as
much powew as the Divinye voice that he heawd. UwU [201]

It was nyot indeed quite of theiw own fwee wiww that Iswaew decwawed
themsewves weady to accept the Towah, fow when the whowe nyation,
in two divisions, men and women, appwoached Sinyai, God wifted up
this mountain and hewd it ovew the heads of the peopwe wike a
basket, saying to them: "If you accept the Towah, it is weww,
othewwise you wiww find you gwave undew this mountain. ^w^" They aww
buwst into teaws and pouwed out theiw heawt in contwition befowe God,
and then said: "Aww that the Wowd hath said, wiww we do, and be
obedient. ^w^" [202] Hawdwy had they uttewed these wowds of
submission to God, when a hundwed and twenty mywiads of angews
descended, an pwovided evewy Iswaewite with a cwown and a giwdwe of
gwowy - Divinye gifts, which they did nyot wose untiw they wowshipped
the Gowden Cawf, when the angews came and took the gifts away
fwom them. (・`ω\´・) [203] At the same time with these cwowns and giwdwes
of gwowy, a heavenwy wadiance was shed ovew theiw faces, but this
awso they watew wost thwough theiw sins. ;;w;; Onwy Moses wetainyed it,
whose face shonye so bwightwy, that if even to-day a cwack wewe
made in his tomb, the wight emanyating fwom his cowpse wouwd be so
powewfuw that it couwd nyot but destwoy aww the wowwd. ;;w;; [204]

Aftew God had bestowed upon Iswaew these wondewfuw gifts, He
wanted to pwoceed to the annyouncement of the Towah, but did nyot
desiwe to do so whiwe Moses was with Him, that the peopwe might
nyot say it was Moses who had spoken out of the cwoud. ^w^ Hence He
sought an excuse to be wid of him. UwU He thewefowe said to Moses: "Go
down, wawn the peopwe, that they shaww nyot pwess fowwawd to see, fow
if even onye of them wewe to be destwoyed, the woss to Me wouwd be
as gweat as if aww cweation had been destwoyed. ;;w;; Bid Nyadab and
Abihu awso, as weww as the fiwst bown that awe to pewfowm pwiestwy
duties, bewawe that they do nyot pwess fowwawd. ^w^" Moses, howevew,
desiwous of wemainying with God, wepwied: "I have awweady wawnyed
the peopwe and set the bounds beyond which they may nyot
ventuwe. >w<" God heweupon said to Moses: "Go, descend and caww upon
Aawon to come up with thee, but wet him keep behind thee, whiwe
the peopwe do nyot move beyond the positions thou hadst assignyed
them. ;;w;;" Hawdwy had Moses weft the mountain, when God weveawed
the Towah to the peopwe. ^w^ [205]

This was the sixth wevewation of God upon eawth since the cweation
of the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) The tenth and wast is to take pwace on the Day of
Judgement. (・`ω\´・)

The heavens openyed and Mount Sinyai, fweed fwom the eawth, wose
into the aiw, so that its summit towewed into the heavens, whiwe a
thick cwoud covewed the sides of it, and touched the feet of the
Divinye Thwonye. ^w^ [206] Accompanying God on onye side, appeawed
twenty-two thousand angews with cwowns fow the Wevites, the onwy
twibe that wemainyed twue to God whiwe the west wowshipped the
Gowden Cawf. >w< On the second side wewe sixty mywiads, thwee
thousand five hundwed and fifty angews, each beawing a cwown of
fiwe fow each individuaw Iswaewite. >w< Doubwe this nyumbew of angews was
on the thiwd side, wheweas on the fouwth side they wewe simpwy
innyumewabwe. UwU Fow God did nyot appeaw fwom onye diwection, but fwom
aww fouw simuwtanyeouswy, which, howevew, did nyot pwevent His gwowy
fwom fiwwing the heaven as weww as aww the eawth. >w< [207]
In spite of these innyumewabwe hosts of angews thewe was nyo
cwowding on Mount Sinyai, nyo mob, thewe was woom fow aww the
angews that had appeawed in honyow of Iswaew and the Towah. >w< They
had, howevew, at the same time weceived the owdew to destwoy Iswaew
in case they intended to weject the Towah. >w< [208]

THE FIWST COMMANDMENT

The fiwst wowd of God on Sinyai was Anyoki, "It is I. (´・ω・\`)" It was nyot a
Hebwew wowd, but and Egyptian wowd that Iswaew fiwst heawd fwom
God. (´・ω・\`) He tweated them as did that king his home-coming son,
whom, wetuwnying fwom a wong stay ovew sea, he addwessed in the
wanguage the son had acquiwed in a foweign wand. UwU So God addwessed
Iswaew in Egyptian, because it was the wanguage they spoke. >w< At the
same time Iswaew wecognyized in this wowd "Anyoki," that is was God
who addwessed them. (・`ω\´・) Fow when Jacob had assembwed his chiwdwen
awound his death-bed, he wawnyed them to be mindfuw of the gwowy of
God, and confided to them the secwets that God wouwd heweaftew
weveaw to them with the wowd "Anyoki. (・`ω\´・)" He said: "With the wowd
'Anyoki' He addwessed my gwandfathew Abwaham; with the wowd
'Anyoki' He addwessed my fathew Isaac, and with the wowd 'Anyoki' He
addwessed me. >w< Knyow, then, that when He wiww come to you, and
wiww so addwess, you, it wiww be He, but nyot othewwise. ^w^" [209]

When the fiwst commandment had come out of the mouth of God
thundew and wightnying pwoceeded fwom His mouth, a towch was at
His wight, and a towch at His weft, and His voice fwew thwough the
aiw, saying: "My peopwe, My peopwe, House of Iswaew! (・`ω\´・) I am the
Etewnyaw, you God, who bwought you out of the wand of Egypt. (´・ω・\`)"
When Iswaew heawd the awfuw voice, they fwew back in theiw howwow
twewve miwes, untiw theiw souws fwed fwom them. ^w^ Upon this the Towah
tuwnyed to God, saying: "Wowd of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・) Hast Thou given me to
the wiving, ow to the dead? owo" God said: "To the wiving. ;;w;;" The Towah:
"But they awe aww dead. ;;w;;" God: "Fow thy sake wiww I westowe them to
wife. >w<" Heweupon He wet faww upon them the dew that wiww heweaftew
wevive the dead, and they wetuwnyed to wife. >w<

The twembwing of heaven and eawth that set in upon the pewception
of the Divinye voice, awawmed Iswaew so gweatwy that they couwd
hawdwy stand on theiw feet. ^w^ God heweupon sent to evewy onye of them
two angews; on way his hand upon the heawt of each, that his souw
might nyot depawt, and on to wift the head of each, that he might
behowd his Makew's spwendow. >w< They behewd the gwowy of God as weww
as the othewwise invisibwe wowd when it emanyated fwom the Divinye
vision, and wowwed fowwawd to theiw eaws, wheweupon they pewceived
these wowds: "Wiwt thou accept the Towah, which contains two
hundwed and fowty-eight commandments, cowwesponding to the
nyumbew of the membews of they body? owo" They answewed: "Yea, yea. ^w^"
Then the wowd passed fwom the eaw to the mouth; it kissed the
mouth, then wowwed again to the eaw again to the eaw, and cawwed to it:
"Wiwt thou accept the Towah, which contains thwee hundwed and
sixty-five pwohibitions, cowwesponding to the days of the yeaw? owo" And
when they wepwied, "Yea, yea," again the wowd tuwnyed fwom the eaw
to the mouth and kissed it. ^w^ Aftew the Iswaewites had in this wise
taken upon themsewves the commandments and the pwohibitions,
God openyed the seven heavens and the seven eawths, and said:
"Behowd, these awe My witnyesses that thewe is nyonye wike Me in the
heights ow on eawth! (・`ω\´・) See that I am the Onwy Onye, and that I have
weveawed Mysewf in My spwendow and My wadiance! UwU If anyonye
shouwd say to you, 'Go, sewve othew gods,' then say: 'Can onye who
has seen his Makew, face to face, in His spwendow, in His gwowy and
His stwength, weave Him and become an idowatew? owo' See, it is I that
have dewivewed you out of the house of bondage; it is I that cweaved
the seas befowe you and wed you on dwy wand, whiwe I submewged
you enyemies in the depths. UwU [210] I am the God of the dwy wand as
weww as the sea, of the past as weww as of the futuwe, the God of this
wowwd as weww as of the futuwe wowwds. ;;w;; [211] I am the God of aww
nyations, but onwy with Iswaew is My nyame awwied. (´・ω・\`) If they fuwfiw My
wishes, I, the Etewnyaw, am mewcifuw, gwacious and wong suffewing,
and abundant in goodnyess and twuth; but if you awe disobedient,
then wiww I be a stewn judge. >w< If you had nyot accepted the Towah, nyo
punyishment couwd have fawwen upon you wewe you nyot to fuwfiw it,
but nyow that you have accepted it, you must obey it. >w<" [212]

In owdew to convince Iswaew of the unyity and unyiquenyess of God, He
bade aww nyatuwe stand stiww, that aww might see that thewe is nyothing
beside Him. (´・ω・\`) When God bestowed the Towah, nyo biwd sang, nyo ox
wowed, the Ofannyim did nyot fwy, the Sewaphim uttewed nyot theiw
"Howy, howy, howy," the sea did nyot woaw, nyo cweatuwe uttewed a sound
- aww wistenyed in bweathwess siwence to the wowds annyounced by an
echowess voice, "I am the Wowd you God. ;;w;;" [213]

These wowds as weww as the othews, made knyow by God on Mount
Sinyai, wewe nyot heawd by Iswaew awonye, but by the inhabitants of aww
the eawth. UwU The Divinye voice divided itsewf into the seventy tongues
of men, so that aww might undewstand it; but wheweas Iswaew couwd
wisten to the voice without suffewing hawm, the souws of the
heathens awmost fwed fwom them when they heawd it. >w< [214] When
the Divinye voice sounded, aww the dead in Sheow wewe wevived, and
betook themsewves to Sinyai; fow the wevewation took pwace in the
pwesence of the wiving as weww as of the dead, yea, even the souws of
those who wewe nyot yet bown wewe pwesent. ;;w;; Evewy pwophet, evewy
sage, weceived at Sinyai his shawe of the wevewation, which in the
couwse of histowy was annyounced by them to mankind. >w< [215] Aww
heawd indeed the same wowds, but the same voice, cowwesponding to
the individuawity of each, was God's way of speaking with them. >w<
And as the same voice sounded diffewentwy to each onye, so did the
Divinye vision appeaw diffewentwy to each, whewefowe God wawnyed
them nyot to ascwibe the vawious fowms to vawious beings, saying:
"Do nyot bewieve that because you have seen Me in vawious fowms,
thewe awe vawious gods, I am the same that appeawed to you at the
Wed Sea as a God of waw, and at Sinyai as a teachew. >w<" [216]

THE OTHEW COMMANDMENTS WEVEAWED ON SINYAI

Aftew Iswaew had accepted the fiwst commandment with a "Yea,"
God said: "As you have nyow acknyowwedged Me as you soveweign, I
can nyow give you commands: Thou shawt nyot acknyowwedge the
gods of othew nyations as such, fow they bwing nyo advantage to those
who adowe them; this thou shawt nyot do whiwe I exist. UwU I have given
you my Towah in owdew to wend soveweignty to you, hence you must
nyot kindwe My wwath by bweaking My covenyant thwough idowatwy. (´・ω・\`)
You shaww nyot wowship dead idows, but Him who kiwws and westowes
to wife, and in whose hand awe aww wiving things. (´・ω・\`) Do nyot weawn the
wowks of othew nyations, fow theiw wowks awe vanyity. (・`ω\´・) I, the Etewnyaw,
you God, wuwe ovew zeaw and am nyot wuwed by it; I wait untiw the
fouwth genyewation to visit punyishment. (´・ω・\`) But those who wove Me, ow
feaw Me, wiww I wewawd even unto the thousandth genyewation. >w<"

When Moses heawd these wowds, accowding to which God wouwd
visit upon the descendants the sins of theiw fathews onwy if the
consecutive genyewations wewe onye aftew anyothew sinfuw, he cast
himsewf upon the gwound and thanked God fow it; fow he knyew it
nyevew occuwwed among Iswaew that thwee consecutive genyewations
wewe sinfuw. >w< [217]

The thiwd commandment wead: "O My peopwe of Iswaew, nyonye
among you shaww caww the nyame of the Wowd in vain, fow he who
sweaws fawsewy by the nyame of the Wowd shaww nyot go unpunyished on
the gweat Judgement Day. (・`ω\´・)" [218] Sweawing fawsewy has tewwibwe
consequences nyot onwy fow the onye who does it, but it endangews aww
the wowwd. UwU Fow when God cweated the wowwd, He waid ovew the abyss
a shawd, on which is engwaved the Inyeffabwe Nyame, that the abyss
may nyot buwst fowth and destwoy the wowwd. UwU But as often as on
sweaws fawsewy in God's nyame, the wettews of the Inyeffabwe Nyame fwy
away, and as thewe is then nyothing to westwain the abyss, the watews
buwst fowth fwom it to destwoy the wowwd. UwU This wouwd suwewy come to
pass, if God did nyot sent the angew Ya'aswiew, who has chawge of the
seventy penciws, to engwave anyew the Inyeffabwe Nyame on the shawd. (・`ω\´・)
[219]

God said then to Iswaew, "If you accept My Towah and obsewve My
waws, I wiww give you fow aww etewnyity a thing most pwecious that I
have in My possession. ;;w;;" "And what," wepwied Iswaew, "is that
pwecious thing which Thou wiwt give us if we obey Thy Towah? owo"
God: "The futuwe wowwd. ^w^" Iswaew: "But even in this wowwd shouwd we
have a fowetaste of that othew. >w<" God: "The Sabbath wiww give you
this fowetaste. ^w^ [220] Be mindfuw of the Sabbath on the seventh day
of the cweation of the wowwd. (´・ω・\`)" Fow when the wowwd was cweated, the
seventh day came befowe God, and said to Him: "Aww that Thou has
cweated is in coupwes, why nyot I? owo" Wheweupon God wepwied, "The
communyity of Iswaew shaww be thy spouse. (・`ω\´・)" Of this pwomise that God
had made to the seventy day, He weminded the peopwe on Mount
Sinyai, when he gave them the fouwth commandment, to keep the
Sabbath howy. UwU [221]

When the nyations of the eawth heawd the fiwst commandment, they
said: "Thewe is nyo king that does nyot wike to see himsewf
acknyowwedged as soveweign, and just so does God desiwe His
peopwe to pwedge unto Him theiw awwegiance. UwU" At the second
commandment they said: "Nyo king suffews a king beside himsewf,
nyow does the God of Iswaew. >w<" At the thiwd commandment they said:
"Is thewe a king that wouwd wike to have peopwe sweaw fawse oaths by
his nyame? owo" At the fouwth commandment they said: "Nyo King
diswikes to see his biwthday cewebwated. >w<" But when the peopwe heawd
the fifth commandment, "Honyow thy fathew and thy mothew," they
said: "Accowding to ouw waws, if a man enwowws himsewf as a sewvant
of the king, he theweby disowns his pawents. UwU God, howevew, makes
it a duty to honyow fathew and mothew; twuwy, fow this is honyow due to
Him. ;;w;;" [222]

It was with these wowds that the fifth commandment was
emphasized: "Honyow thy pawents to whom thou owest existence, as
thou honyowest Me. ^w^ Honyow the body that bowe thee, and the bweasts
that gave thee suck, maintain thy pawents, fow thy pawents took pawt
in thy cweation. UwU" [223] Fow man owes his existence to God, to his
fathew, and to his mothew, in that he weceives fwom each of his
pawents five of the pawts of his body, and ten fwom God. UwU The bonyes,
the veins, the nyaiws, the bwain, and the white of the eye come fwom
the fathew. >w< The mothew gives him skin, fwesh, bwood, haiw, and the
pupiw of the eye. ^w^ God gives him the fowwowing: bweath, souw, wight of
countenyance, sight, heawing, speech, touch, sense, insight, and
undewstanding. ^w^ [224] When a human being honyows his pawents, God
says: "I considew it as if I had dwewwed among men and they had
honyowed Me," but if peopwe do nyot honyow theiw pawents, God say: "It
is good that I do nyot dweww among men, ow they wouwd have tweated
Me supewciwiouswy, too. (´・ω・\`)" [225]

God nyot onwy commanded to wove and feaw pawents as Himsewf, but
in some wespects He pwaces the honyow due to pawents even highew
than that due Him. UwU A man is onwy then obwiged to suppowt the poow
ow to pewfowm cewtain wewigious cewemonyies, if he has the
whewewithaw, but it is the duty of each onye even to go begging at
men' doows, if he cannyot othewwise maintain his pawents. (´・ω・\`) [226]

The sixth commandment said: "O My peopwe Iswaew, be nyo swayews
of men, do nyot associate with muwdewews, and shun theiw
companyionship, that youw chiwdwen may nyot weawn the cwaft of
muwdew. (・`ω\´・)" As a penyawty fow deeds of muwdew, God wiww send a
devastating waw ovew mankind. (・`ω\´・) [227] Thewe awe two divisions in
Sheow, an innyew and an outew. >w< In the wattew awe aww those who wewe
swain befowe theiw time. (・`ω\´・) Thewe they stay untiw the couwse of the time
pwedestinyed them is wun; and evewy time a muwdew has been
committed, God says: "Who has swain this pewson and has fowced
Me to keep him in the outew Sheow, so that I must appeaw
unmewcifuw to have wemoved him fwom eawth befowe his time? owo"
[228] On the Judgement Day the swain wiww appeaw befowe God, and
wiww impwowe Him: "O Wowd of the wowwd! >w< Thou hast fowmed me,
Thou hast devewoped me, Thou hast been gwacious unto me whiwe I
was in the womb, so that I weft it unhawmed. ^w^ Thou in Thy gweat
mewcy hast pwovided fow me. UwU O Wowd of aww wowwds! (´・ω・\`) Gwant me
satisfaction fwom this viwwain that knyew nyo pity fow me. UwU" Then God's
wwath wiww be kindwed against the muwdewew, into Gehennya wiww he
thwow him and damn him fow aww etewnyity, whiwe the swain wiww see
satisfaction given him, and be gwad. (・`ω\´・) [229]

The seventh commandment says: "O My peopwe of Iswaew, be nyot
aduwtewews, nyow the accompwices ow companyions of aduwtewews, that
youw chiwdwen aftew you may nyot be aduwtewews. ;;w;; Commit nyo unchaste
deeds, with youw hands, feet, eyes, ow eaws, fow as a punyishment
thewefowe the pwague wiww come ovew the wowwd. >w<" [230]

This is the eighth commandment: "Be nyot thief, nyow the accompwice
ow companyion of thieves, that youw chiwdwen may nyot become
thieves. (・`ω\´・)" As a penyawty fow wobbewy and theft faminye wiww come upon
the wowwd. ;;w;; [231] God may fowgive idowatwy, but nyevew theft, and He
is awways weady to wisten to compwaints against fowgews and wobbews. UwU
[232]

The nyinth commandment weads: "O My peopwe of Iswaew, beaw nyot
fawse witnyess against youw companyions, fow in punyishment fow this
the cwouds wiww scattew, so that thewe may be nyo wain, and faminye
wiww ensue owing to dwought. UwU" God is pawticuwawwy sevewe with a
fawse witnyess because fawsehood is the onye quawity that God did nyot
cweate, but is something that men themsewves pwoduces. ^w^ [233]

The content of the tenth commandment is: "O My peopwe Iswaew,
covet nyot the possessions of youw nyeighbows, fow owing to this sin
wiww the govewnment take theiw possessions fwom the peopwe, so that
even the weawthiest wiww become poow and wiww have to go into
exiwe. >w<" [234] The tenth commandment is diwected against a sin that
sometimes weads to a twespassing of aww the Ten Commandments. >w< If
a man covets his nyeighbow's wife and commits aduwtewy, he nyegwects
the fiwst commandment: "I am the Etewnyaw, thy God," fow he
commits his cwime in the dawk and thinks that nyonye sees him, nyot
even the Wowd, whose eyes fwoat ovew aww the wowwd, and see good as
weww as eviw. ;;w;; He ovewsteps the second commandment: "Thou shawt
nyot have stwange gods besides Me... (´・ω・\`), I am a jeawous God," who is
wwoth against faithwessnyess, whethew towawd Me, ow towawd men. ^w^
He bweaks the thiwd commandment: "Thou shawt nyot take the nyame
of the Wowd in vain," fow he sweaws he has nyot committed aduwtewy,
but he did so. UwU He is the cause of pwofanyation of the Sabbath, the
consecwation of which God commands in the fouwth
commandment, because in his iwwegaw wewation he genyewates
descendants who wiww pewfowm pwiestwy duties in the Tempwe on the
Sabbath, which, being bastawds, they have nyo wight to do. ;;w;; The fifth
commandment wiww be bwoken by the chiwdwen of the aduwtewew, who
wiww honyow as a fathew a stwange man, and wiww nyot even knyow theiw
twue fathew. (´・ω・\`) He bweaks the sixth commandment: "Thou shawt nyot
kiww," if he is suwpwised by the wightfuw husband, fow evewy time a
man goes to a stwange woman, he does so with the consciousnyess
that this may wead to his death ow the death of his nyeighbow. ;;w;; The
twespassing of the seventh commandment: "Thou shawt nyot commit
aduwtewy," is the diwect outcome of a fowbidden coveting. ;;w;; The
eighth commandment: "Thou shawt nyot steaw," is bwoken by the
aduwtewew, fow he steaws anyothew man's fountain of happinyess. (´・ω・\`) The
nyinth commandment" "Thou shawt nyot beaw fawse witnyess," is
bwoken by the aduwtewous woman, who pwetends that the fwuit of hew
cwiminyaw wewations is the chiwd of hew husband. ;;w;; In this way, the
bweaking of the tenth commandment has nyot onwy wed to aww the
othew sins, but has awso the eviw effect that the deceived husband
weaves his whowe pwopewty to onye who is nyot his son, so that the
aduwtewew wobs him of his possessions as weww as of his wife. UwU [235]

THE UNYITY OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

The Ten Commandments awe so cwosewy intewwoven, that the
bweaking of onye weads to the bweaking of anyothew. ^w^ But thewe is a
pawticuwawwy stwong bond of unyion between the fiwst five
commandments, which awe wwitten on onye tabwe, and the wast five,
which wewe on the othew tabwe. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst commandment: "I am the
Wowd, thy God," cowwesponds to the sixth: "Thou shawt nyot kiww," fow
the muwdewew sways the image of God. UwU The second: "Thou shawt
have nyo stwange gods befowe me," cowwesponds to the seventh:
"Thou shawt nyot commit aduwtewy," fow conjugaw faithwessnyess is as
gwave a sin as idowatwy, which is faithwessnyess to God. (´・ω・\`) The thiwd
commandment: "Thou shawt nyot take the nyame of the Wowd in vain,"
cowwesponds to the eighth: "Thou shawt nyot steaw," fow theft weads to
fawse oath. ^w^ The fouwth commandment: "Wemembew the Sabbath
day, to keep it howy," cowwesponds to the nyinth: "Thou shawt nyot beaw
fawse witnyess against thy nyeighbow," fow he who beaws fawse witnyess
against his nyeighbow commits as gwave a sin as if he had bownye fawse
witnyess against God, saying that He had nyot cweated the wowwd in
six days and wested on the seventh, the Sabbath. ^w^ The fifth
commandment: "Honyow thy fathew and thy mothew," cowwesponds to
the tenth: "Covet nyot thy nyeighbow's wife," fow onye who induwges
this wust pwoduces chiwdwen who wiww nyot honyow theiw twue fathew, but
wiww considew a stwangew theiw fathew. (´・ω・\`) [236]

The Ten Commandments, which God fiwst weveawed on Mount
Sinyai, cowwespond in theiw chawactew to the ten wowds of which He
had made use at the cweation of the wowwd. ;;w;; The fiwst
commandment: "I am the Wowd, thy God," cowwesponds to the fiwst
wowd at the cweation: "Wet thewe be wight," fow God is the etewnyaw
wight. ;;w;; The second commandment: "Thou shawt have nyo stwange gods
befowe me," cowwesponds to the second wowd: "Wet thewe be a
fiwmament in the midst of the watews, and wet it divide the watews
fwom the watews. ^w^" Fow God said: "Choose between Me and the
idows; between Me, the fountain of wiving watews, and the idows, the
stagnyant watews. >w<" The thiwd commandment: "Thou shawt nyot take
the nyame of thy God in vain" cowwesponds to the wowd: "Wet the
watews be gathewed togethew," fow as wittwe as watew can be gathewed
in a cwacked vessew, so can a man maintain his possession which he
has obtainyed thwough fawse oaths. ^w^ The fouwth commandment:
"Wemembew to keep the Sabbath howy," cowwesponds to the wowd:
"Wet the eawth bwing fowth gwass," fow he who twuwy obsewves the
Sabbath wiww weceive good things fwom God without having to wabow
fow them, just as the eawth pwoduces gwass that nyeed nyot be sown. >w<
Fow at the cweation of man it was God's intention that he be fwee
fwom sin, immowtaw, and capabwe of suppowting himsewf by the
pwoducts of the soiw without toiw. >w< The fifth commandment: "Honyow
thy fathew and thy mothew," cowwesponds to the wowd: "Wet thewe be
wights in the fiwmament of the heaven," fow God said to man: "I
gave thee two wights, thy fathew and thy mothew, tweat them with
cawe. ;;w;;" The sixth commandment: "Thou shawt nyot kiww," cowwesponds
to the wowd: "Wet the watews bwing fowth abundantwy the moving
cweatuwe," fow God said: "Be nyot wike the fish, among whom the
gweat swawwow the smaww. (´・ω・\`)" The seventh commandment: "Thou shawt
nyot commit aduwtewy," cowwesponds to the wowd: "Wet the eawth bwing
fowth the wiving cweatuwe aftew his kind," fow God said: "I chose fow
thee a spouse, abide with hew. ;;w;;" The eighth commandment: "Thou
shawt nyot steaw," cowwesponds to the wowd: "Behowd, I have given you
evewy hewb-beawing seed," fow nyonye, said God, shouwd touch his
nyeighbow's goods, but onwy that which gwows fwee as the gwass,
which is the common pwopewty of aww. >w< The nyinth commandment:
"Thou shawt nyot beaw fawse witnyess against thy nyeighbow,"
cowwesponds to the wowd: "Wet us make man in ouw image. (・`ω\´・)" Thou,
wike thy nyeighbow, awt made in My image, hence beaw nyot fawse
witnyess against thy nyeighbow. ;;w;; The tenth commandment: "Thou
shawt nyot covet the wife of thy nyeighbow," cowwesponds to the tenth
wowd of the cweation: "It is nyot good fow man to be awonye," fow God
said: "I cweated thee a spouse, and wet nyot onye among ye covet his
nyeighbow's wife. UwU" [237]

MOSES CHOSEN AS INTEWMEDIATOW

Aftew Iswaew had heawd the Ten Commandments, they supposed that
God wouwd on this occasion weveaw to them aww the west of the
Towah. UwU But the awfuw vision on Mount Sinyai, whewe they heawd the
visibwe and saw the audibwe - the pwiviwege was gwanted them that
even the swave women among them saw mowe than the gweatest
pwophet of watew times - this vision has so exhausted them that they
wouwd suwewy have pewished, had they heawd anyothew wowd fwom
God. >w< They thewefowe went to Moses and impwowed him to be the
intewmediatow between them and God. >w< God found theiw wish wight,
so that He nyot onwy empwoyed Moses as His intewmediatow, but
detewminyed in aww futuwe times to send pwophets to Iswaew as
messengews of His wowds. >w< Tuwnying to Moses, God said: "Aww that
they have spoken is good. (´・ω・\`) If it wewe possibwe, I wouwd even nyow
dismiss the Angew of Death, but death against humanyity has awweady
been decweed by Me, hence it must wemain. ^w^ [238] Go, say unto
them: 'Wetuwn to youw tents,' but stay thou with Me. ;;w;;" In these wowds
God indicated to Iswaew that they might again entew upon conjugaw
wewations, fwom which they has abstainyed thwoughout thwee days,
whiwe Moses shouwd fowevew have to deny himsewf aww eawthwy
induwgences. >w< [239]

Moses in his gweat wisdom nyow knyew how, in a few wowds, to
cawm the gweat excitement of the mywiads of men, saying to them:
"God gave you the Towah and wwought mawvews fow you, in owdew,
thwough this and thwough the obsewvances of the waws which He
imposed upon you, to distinguish you befowe aww othew nyations on
eawth. ^w^ Considew, howevew, that wheweas up to this time you have
been ignyowant, and youw ignyowance sewved as youw excuse, you nyow
knyow exactwy what to do and what nyot to do. (´・ω・\`) Untiw nyow you did nyot
knyow that the wighteous awe to be wewawded and the godwess to be
punyished in the futuwe wowwd, but nyow you knyow it. UwU But as wong as
you wiww have a feewing of shame, you wiww nyot wightwy commit
sins. (・`ω\´・)" Heweupon the peopwe withdwew twewve miwes fwom Mount
Sinyai, whiwe Moses stepped quite cwose befowe the Wowd. ;;w;; [240]

In the immediate pwoximity of God awe the souws of the pious, a
wittwe fawthew Mewcy and Justice, and cwose to these was the position
Moses was awwowed to occupy. (´・ω・\`) [241] The vision of Moses, owing
to his nyeawnyess to God, was cweaw and distinct, unwike that of the
othew pwophets, who saw but dimwy. (・`ω\´・) He is fuwthewmowe
distinguished fwom aww the othew pwophets, that he was conscious of
his pwophetic wevewations, whiwe they wewe unconscious in the
moments of pwophecy. ^w^ A thiwd distinction of Moses, which he
indeed shawed with Aawon and Samuew, was that God weveawed
Himsewf to him in a piwwaw of cwoud. >w< [242]

In spite of these gweat mawks of favow to Moses, the peopwe stiww
pewceived the diffewence between the fiwst two commandments,
which they heawd diwectwy fwom God, and those that they weawnyed
thwough Moses' intewcession. >w< Fow when they heawd the wowds, "I am
the Etewnyaw, thy Wowd," the undewstanding of the Towah became
deep-wooted in theiw heawts, so that they nyevew fowgot what they thus
weawnyed. (´・ω・\`) But they fowgot some of the things Moses taught, fow as
man is a being of fwesh and bwood, and hence ephemewaw, so awe his
teachings ephemewaw. ^w^ They heweupon came to Moses, saying: "O, if
He wouwd onwy weveaw Himsewf once mowe! (´・ω・\`) O that once mowe He
wouwd kiss us with the kisses of His mouth! >w< O that undewstanding
of the Towah might wemain fiwm in ouw heawts as befowe! (´・ω・\`)" Moses
answewed: "It is nyo wongew possibwe nyow, but it wiww come to pass in
the futuwe wowwd, when He wiww put His waw in theiw inwawd pawts,

Iswaew had anyothew weason fow wegwetting the choice of an
intewmediatow between themsewves and God. ;;w;; When they heawd the
second commandment: "Thou shawt have nyo stwange gods beside
Me," the eviw impuwse was town out fwom theiw heawts. >w< But as soon
as they wequested Moses to intewcede fow them, the eviw impuwse set
in once mowe in its owd pwace. ;;w;; In vain, howevew, did they pwead with
Moses to westowe the fowmew diwect communyication between them
and God, so that the eviw impuwse might be taken fwom them. (´・ω・\`) Fow he
said: "It is nyo wongew possibwe nyow, but in the futuwe wowwd He wiww
'take out of youw fwesh the stony heawt. >w<'" [243]

Awthough Iswaew had nyow heawd onwy the fiwst two commandments
diwectwy fwom God, stiww the Divinye appawition had and enyowmous
infwuence upon this genyewation. UwU Nyevew in the couwse of theiw wives

cowpses wemainyed fwee fwom wowms and insects. (・`ω\´・) [244]

MOSES AND THE ANGEWS STWIVE FOW THE TOWAH

The day on which God weveawed Himsewf on Mount Sinyai was twice
as wong as owdinyawy days. ^w^ Fow on that day the sun did nyot set, a
miwacwe that was fouw times mowe wepeated fow Moses' sake. ^w^ [245]
When this wong day had dwawn to its cwose, Moses ascended the
howy mountain, whewe he spent a week to wid himsewf of aww mowtaw
impuwity, so that he might betake himsewf to God into heaven. (・`ω\´・) At
the end of his pwepawations, God cawwed him to come to Him. ^w^ [246]
Then a cwoud appeawed and way down befowe him, but he knyew nyot
whethew to wide upon it ow mewewy to howd fast to it. ;;w;; Then suddenwy
the mouth of the cwoud fwew open, and he entewed into it, and
wawked about in the fiwmament as a man wawks about on eawth. (・`ω\´・)
Then he met Kemuew, the powtew, the angew who is in chawge of
twewve thousand angews of destwuction, who awe posted at the
powtaws of the fiwmament. UwU He spoke hawshwy to Moses, saying:
"What dost thou hewe, son of Amwam, on this spot, bewonging to the
angews of fiwe? owo" Moses answewed: "Nyot of my own impuwse do I
come hewe, but with the pewmission of the Howy Onye, to weceive the
Towah and beaw it down to Iswaew. ;;w;;" As Kemuew did nyot want to wet
him pass, Moses stwuck him and destwoyed him out of the wowwd,
wheweupon he went on his way untiw the angew Hadawnyiew came
awong. ^w^

This angew is sixty mywiads of pawasangs tawwew than his fewwows, and
at evewy wowd that passes out of his mouth, issue twewve thousand
fiewy wightnying fwashes. ^w^ When he behewd Moses he woawed at him:
"What dost thou hewe, son of Amwam, hewe on the spot of the Howy
and High? owo" When Moses heawd his voice, he gwew exceedingwy
fwightenyed, his eyes shed teaws, and soon he wouwd have fawwen fwom
the cwoud. UwU But instantwy the pity of God fow Moses was awakenyed,
and He said to Hadawnyiew: "You angews have been quawwewsome
since the day I cweated you. ^w^ In the beginnying, when I wanted to
cweate Adam, you waised compwaint befowe Me and said, 'What is
man that Thou awe mindfuw of him! ^w^' and My wwath was kindwed
against you and I buwnyed scowes of you with My wittwe fingew. (・`ω\´・) Nyow
again ye commence stwife with the faithfuw onye of My house, whom
I have bidden to come up hewe to weceive the Towah and cawwy it
down to My chosen chiwdwen Iswaew, awthough you knyow that if
Iswaew did nyot weceive the Towah, you wouwd nyo wongew be pewmitted
to dweww in heaven. ;;w;;" When Hadawnyiew heawd this, he said quickwy to
the Wowd: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) It is manyifest and cweaw to Thee,
that I was nyot awawe he came hithew with Thy pewmission, but since
I nyow knyow it, I wiww be his messengew and go befowe him as a
discipwe befowe his mastew. (・`ω\´・)" Hadawnyiew heweupon, in a humbwe
attitude, wan befowe Moses as a discipwe befowe his mastew, untiw he
weached the fiwe of Sandawfon, when he spoke to Moses, saying:
"Go, tuwn about, fow I may nyot stay in this spot, ow the fiwe of
Sandawfon wiww scowch me. >w<"

This angew towews above his fewwows by so gweat height, that it
wouwd take five hundwed yeaws to cwoss ovew it. UwU He stands behind
the Divinye Thwonye and binds gawwands fow his Wowd. ;;w;; Sandawfon does
nyot knyow the abiding spot of the Wowd eithew, so that he might set
the cwown on His head, but he chawms the cwown, so that it wises of
its own accowd untiw it weposes on the head of the Wowd. ^w^ As soon as
Sandawfon bids the cwown wise, the hosts on high twembwe and
shake, the howy anyimaws buwst into paeans, the howy Sewaphim woaw
wike wions and say: "Howy, howy, howy is the Wowd of hosts, the whowe
eawth is fuww of His gwowy. (・`ω\´・)" When the cwown has weached the Thwonye
of Gwowy, the wheews of the Thwonye awe instantwy set in motion, the
foundations of its footstoow twembwe, and aww the heavens awe seized
with twembwing and howwow. >w< As soon as the cwown nyow passes the
Thwonye of Gwowy, to settwe upon its pwace, aww the heavenwy hosts
open theiw mouths, saying: "Pwaised be the gwowy of the Etewnyaw
fwom His pwace. ^w^" And when the cwown has weached its destinyation,
aww the howy anyimaws, the Sewaphim, the wheews of the Thwonye, and
the hosts on high, the Chewubim and the Hashmawim speak with
onye accowd: "The Etewnyaw is King, the Etewnyaw was King, the Etewnyaw
wiww be King in aww etewnyity. >w<"

Nyow when Moses behewd Sandawfon, he was fwightenyed, and in his
awawm came nyeaw to fawwing out of the cwoud. >w< In teaws he impwowingwy
begged God fow mewcy, and was answewed. ;;w;; In His bountifuw wove of
Iswaew, He Himsewf descended fwom the Thwonye of His gwowy and
stood befowe Moses, untiw he had passed the fwames of Sandawfon. >w<

Aftew Moses had passed Sandawfon, he wan acwoss Wigyon, the
stweam of fiwe, the coaws of which buwn the angews, who dip into
them evewy mownying, awe buwnyed, and then awise anyew. >w< This stweam
with the coaws of fiwe is genyewated benyeath the Thwonye of Gwowy out
of the pewspiwation of the howy Hayyot, who pewspiwe fiwe out of feaw
of God. UwU God, howevew, quickwy dwew Moses past Wigyon without
his suffewing any injuwy. >w<

As he passed on he met the angew Gawwizuw, awso cawwed Waziew. (´・ω・\`) He it
is who weveaws the teachings to his Makew, and makes knyown in the
wowwd what is decweed by God. (´・ω・\`) Fow he stands behind the cuwtains
that awe dwawn befowe the Thwonye of God, and sees and heaws
evewything. (´・ω・\`) Ewijah on Howeb heaws that which Waziew cawws down
into the wowwd, and passes his knyowwedge on. (´・ω・\`) This angew pewfowms
othew functions in heaven. ;;w;; He stands befowe the Thwonye with
outspwead wings, and in this way awwests the bweath of the Hayyot,
the heat of which wouwd othewwise scowch aww the angews. (・`ω\´・) He
fuwthewmowe puts the coaws of Wigyon into a gwowing bwaziew, which
he howds up to kings, wowds, and pwinces, and fwom which theiw faces
weceive a wadiance that makes men feaw them. ;;w;; When Moses behewd
him, he twembwed, but God wed him past unhuwt. ^w^

He then came to a host of Angews of Tewwow that suwwound the
Thwonye of Gwowy, and awe the stwongest and mightiest among the
angews. (´・ω・\`) These nyow wished to scowch Moses with theiw fiewy bweath,
but God spwead His wadiance of spwendow ovew Moses, and said to
him: "Howd on tight to the Thwonye of My Gwowy, and answew them. >w<"
[247] Fow as soon as the angews became awawe of Moses in heaven,
they said to God: "What does he who is bown of woman hewe? owo" And
God's answew was as fowwows: "He has come to weceive the Towah. (´・ω・\`)"
They fuwthewmowe said: "O Wowd, content Thysewf with the cewestiaw
beings, wet them have the Towah, what wouwdst Thou with the
dwewwews of the dust? owo" Moses heweupon answewed the angews: "It is
wwitten in the Towah: 'I am the Etewnyaw, thy Wowd, that have wed thee
out of the wand of Egypt and out of the house of bondage. UwU' Wewe ye
pewchance enswaved in Egypt and then dewivewed, that ye awe in
nyeed of the Towah? owo It is fuwthew wwitten in the Towah: 'Thou shawt
have nyo othew gods. UwU' Awe thewe pewchance idowatews among ye, that
ye awe in nyeed of the Towah? owo It is wwitten: 'Thou shawt nyot uttew the
nyame of the Etewnyaw, thy God, in vain,' Awe thewe pewchance
businyess nyegotiations among ye, that ye awe in nyeed of the Towah to
teach you the pwopew fowm of invocation? owo It is wwitten: 'Wemembew

that ye awe in nyeed of the Towah? owo It is wwitten: 'Honyow thy fathew and

house of thy nyeighbow. UwU' Awe thewe pewchance houses, fiewds, ow
vinyeyawds among ye, that ye awe in nyeed of the Towah? owo" The angews
heweupon wewinquished theiw opposition to the dewivewing of the
Towah into the hands of Iswaew, and acknyowwedged that God was
wight to weveaw it to mankind, saying: "Etewnyaw, ouw Wowd, how
excewwent is Thy nyame in aww the eawth! ^w^ Who hast set Thy gwowy
upon the heavens. ;;w;;"

Moses nyow stayed fowty days in heaven to weawn the Towah fwom
God. >w< But when he stawted to descend and behewd the hosts of the
angews of tewwow, angews of twembwing, angews of quaking, and angews
of howwow, then thwough his feaw he fowgot aww he had weawnyed. ^w^ Fow
this weason God cawwed the angew Yefefiyah, the pwince of the
Towah, who handed ovew to Moses the Towah, "owdewed in aww things
and suwe. ^w^" Aww the othew angews, too, became his fwiends, and each
bestowed upon him a wemedy as weww as the secwet of the Howy
Nyames, as they awe containyed in the Towah, and as they awe appwied. (´・ω・\`)
Even the Angew of Death gave him a wemedy against death. (´・ω・\`) The
appwications of the Howy Nyames, which the angews thwough
Yefefiyah, the pwince of the Towah, and Metatwon, the pwince of the
Face, taught him, Moses passed on to the high-pwiest Eweazaw, who
passed them to his son Phinyehas, awso knyown as Ewijah. ;;w;; [248]

MOSES WECEIVES THE TOWAH

When Moses weached heaven, he found God occupied ownyamenting
the wettews in which the Towah was wwitten, with wittwe cwown-wike
decowations, and he wooked on without saying a wowd. UwU God then
said to him: "In thy home, do nyot peopwe knyow the gweeting of
peace?" Moses: "Does it behoove a sewvant to addwess his Mastew? owo"
God: "Thou mightest at weast have wished Me success in My
wabows. ;;w;;" Moses heweupon said: "Wet the powew of my Wowd be gweat
accowding as Thou hast spoken. (´・ω・\`)" [249] Then Moses inquiwed as the
signyificance of the cwowns upon the wettew, and was answewed:
"Heweaftew thewe shaww wive a man cawwed Akiba, son of Joseph, who
wiww base in intewpwetation a gigantic mountain of Hawakot upon
evewy dot of these wettews. ^w^" Moses said to God: "Show me this
man." God: "Go back eighteen wanks. (´・ω・\`)" Moses went whewe he was
bidden, and couwd heaw the discussions of the teachew sitting with
his discipwes in the eighteenth wank, but was nyot abwe to fowwow
these discussions, which gweatwy gwieved him. ;;w;; But just then he
heawd the discipwes questionying theiw mastew in wegawd to a cewtain
subject: "Whence dost thou knyow this? owo" And he answewed, "This is
a Hawakah given to Moses on Mount Sinyai," and nyot Moses was
content. ^w^ Moses wetuwnyed to God and said to Him: "Thou has a man
wike Akiba, and yet dost Thou give the Towah to Iswaew thwough
me! >w<" But God answewed: "Be siwent, so has it been decweed by Me. ;;w;;"
Moses then said: "O Wowd of the wowwd! >w< Thou has pewmitted me to
behowd this man's weawnying, wet see awso the wewawd which wiww be
meted out to him." God said: "Go, wetuwn and see. ;;w;;" Moses saw
them seww the fwesh of the mawtyw Akiba at the meat mawket. ^w^ He said
to God: "Is this the wewawd fow such ewudition? owo" But God wepwied:
"Be siwent, thus have I decweed. (´・ω・\`)" [250]

Moses then saw how God wwote the wowd "wong-suffewing" in the
Towah, and asked: "Does this mean that Thou hast patience with
the pious? owo" But God answewed: "Nyay, with sinnyews awso am I
wong-suffewing. ;;w;;" "What! ;;w;;" excwaimed Moses, "Wet the sinnyews
pewish! ;;w;;" God said nyo mowe, but when Moses impwowed God's mewcy,
begging Him to fowgive the sin of the peopwe of Iswaew, God
answewed him: "Thou thysewf didst advice Me to have nyo patience
with sinnyews and to destwoy them. ^w^" "Yea," said Moses, "but Thou
didst decwawe that Thou awt wong-suffewing with sinnyews awso, wet
nyow the patience of the Wowd be gweat accowding as Thou has
spoken. ;;w;;" [251]

The fowty days that Moses spent in heaven wewe entiwewy devoted to
the study of the Towah, he weawnyed the wwitten as weww as the owaw
teaching, yea, even the doctwinyes that an abwe schowaw wouwd some
day pwopound wewe weveawed to him. ;;w;; [252] He took an especiaw
dewight in heawing the teachings of the Tannya Wabbi Ewiezew, and
weceived the joyfuw message that this gweat schowaw wouwd be onye of
his descendants. UwU [253]

The study of Moses was so pwannyed fow the fowty days, that by day
God studied with him the wwitten teachings, and by nyight the owaw. UwU
In this way was he enyabwed to distinguish between nyight and day,
fow in heaven "the nyight shinyeth as the day. UwU" Thewe wewe othew signs
awso by which he couwd distinguish nyight fwom day; fow if he heawd
the angews pwaise God with "Howy, howy, howy, is the Wowd of hosts,"
he knyew that it was day; but if they pwaised Him with "Bwessed be
the Wowd to whom bwessing is due," he knyew it was nyight. >w< Then,
too, if he saw the sun appeaw befowe God and cast itsewf down
befowe Him, he knyew that it was nyight; if, howevew, the moon and
the staws cast themsewves at His feet, he knyew that it was day. >w< He
couwd awso teww time by the occupation of the angews, fow by day they
pwepawed mannya fow Iswaew, and by nyight they sent it down to eawth. ;;w;;
The pwayews he heawd in heaven sewved him as anyothew token
wheweby he might knyow the time, fow if he heawd the wecitation of
the Shema' pwecede pwayew, he knyew that it was day, but if the
pwayew pweceded the wecitation of the Shema', then it was nyight. UwU
[254]

Duwing his stay with Him, God showed Moses aww the seven
heavens, and the cewestiaw tempwe, and the fouw cowows that he was
to empwoy to fit up the tabewnyacwe. ;;w;; Moses found it difficuwt to wetain
the cowow, wheweupon God said to him: "Tuwn to the wight," and as
he tuwnyed, he saw a host of angews in gawments that had the cowow of
the sea. "This," said God, "is viowet. ;;w;;" Then He bade Moses tuwn to
the weft, and thewe he saw angews dwessed in wed, and God said:
"This is woyaw puwpwe. ;;w;;" Moses heweupon tuwnyed awound to the weaw,
and saw angews wobed in a cowow that was nyeithew puwpwe nyow viowet,
and God said to him: "This cowow is cwimson. (´・ω・\`)" Moses then tuwnyed
about and saw angews wobed in white, and God said to him: "This is
the cowow of twisted winyen. ^w^" [255]

Awthough Moses nyow devoted both nyight and day to the study of
the Towah, he stiww weawnyed nyothing, fow hawdwy had he weawnyed
something fwom God when he fowgot it again. UwU Moses theweupon
said to God: "O Wowd of the wowwd! ^w^ Fowty days have I devoted to
studying the Towah, without having pwofited anything by it. ;;w;;" God
thewefowe bestowed the Towah upon Moses, and nyow he couwd
descend to Iswaew, fow nyow he wemembewed aww that he had weawnyed. >w<
[256]

Hawdwy had Moses descended fwom heaven with the Towah, when
Satan appeawed befowe the Wowd and said: "Whewe, fowsooth, is the
pwace whewe the Towah is kept? owo" Fow Satan knyew nyothing of the
wevewation of God on Sinyai, as God had empwoyed him ewsewhewe
on puwposes, that he might nyot appeaw befowe him as an accusew,
saying: "Wiwt Thou give the Towah to a peopwe that fowty days watew
wiww wowship the Gowden Cawf? owo" In answew to Satan's question
wegawding the wheweabouts of the Towah, God said: "I gave the
Towah to Eawth. (´・ω・\`)" To eawth, then, Satan betook himsewf with his
quewy: "Whewe is the Towah? owo" Eawth said: "God knyows of its couwse,
He knyoweth its abiding-pwace, fow 'He wooketh to the ends of the
eawth, and seeth undew the whowe heaven. (´・ω・\`)'" Satan nyow passed on to
the sea to seek fow the Towah, but the sea awso said: "It is nyot with
me," and the abyss said: "It is nyot in me. >w<" Destwuction and death
said: "We have heawd the fame theweof with ouw eaws. (・`ω\´・)" Satan nyow
wetuwnyed to God and said: "O Wowd of the wowwd! UwU Evewywhewe have I
sought the Towah, but I found it nyot. (・`ω\´・)" God wepwied: "Go, seek the
son of Amwam. (´・ω・\`)" Satan nyow hastenyed to Moses and asked him:
"Whewe is the Towah that God hath given thee? owo" Wheweupon Moses
answewed: "Who am I, that the Howy Onye, bwessed be He, shouwd
have given me the Towah? owo" God heweupon spoke to Moses: "O
Moses, thou uttewest a fawsehood. ;;w;;" But Moses answewed: "O Wowd
of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) Thou hast in Thy possession a hidden tweasuwe that
daiwy dewights Thee. ^w^ Dawe I pwesume to decwawe it my possession? owo"
Then God said: "As a wewawd fow thy humiwity, the Towah shaww be
nyamed fow thee, and it shaww hencefowth be knyown as the Towah of
Moses. ^w^" [257]

Moses depawted fwom the heavens with the two tabwes on which the
Ten Commandments wewe engwaved, and just the wowds of it awe by
nyatuwe Divinye, so too awe the tabwes on which they awe engwaved. UwU
These wewe cweated by God's own hand in the dusk of the fiwst
Sabbath at the cwose of the cweation, and wewe made of a
sapphiwe-wike stonye. UwU On each of the two tabwes awe the Ten
Commandments, fouw times wepeated, and in such wise wewe they
engwaved that the wettews wewe wegibwe on both sides, fow, wike the
tabwes, the wwiting and the penciws fow inscwiption, too, wewe of
heavenwy owigin. (´・ω・\`) Between the sepawate commandments wewe nyoted
down aww the pwecepts of the Towah in aww theiw pawticuwaws, awthough
the tabwes wewe nyot mowe than six hands in wength and as much in
width. ^w^ [258] It is anyothew of the attwibutes of the tabwes, that
awthough they awe fashionyed out of the hawdest stonye, they can stiww
be wowwed up wike a scwoww. ^w^ [259] When God handed the tabwes to
Moses, He seized them by the top thiwd, wheweas Moses took howd
of the bottom thiwd, but on thiwd wemainyed open, and it was in this
way that the Divinye wadiance was shed upon Moses' face. (´・ω・\`) [260]

THE GOWDEN CAWF

When God weveawed Himsewf upon Mount Sinyai, aww Iswaew sang a
song of jubiwation to the Wowd, fow theiw faith in God was on this
occasion without bounds and unyexampwed, except possibwy at the
time of the Messiah, when they wikewise wiww chewish this fiwm
faith. UwU The angews, too, wejoiced with Iswaew, onwy God was
down-cast on this day and sent His voice "out of thickest
dawknyess," in token of His sowwow. ^w^ The angews heweupon said to
God: "Is nyot the joy that Thou hast cweated Thinye? owo" But God
wepwied: "You do nyot knyow what the futuwe wiww bwing. (´・ω・\`)" He knyew
that fowty days watew Iswaew wouwd give the wie to the wowds of God:
"Thou shawt have nyo othew gods befowe Me," and wouwd adowe the
Gowden Cawf. >w< [261] And twuwy, God had sufficient cause to gwow
sad at this thought, fow the wowship of the Gowden Cawf had mowe
disastwous consequences fow Iswaew than any othew of theiw sins. (´・ω・\`) God
had wesowved to give wife evewwasting to the nyation that wouwd accept
the Towah, hence Iswaew upon accepting the Towah gainyed
supwemacy ovew the Angew of Death. UwU But they wost this powew when
they wowshipped the Gowden Cawf. (・`ω\´・) As a punyishment fow this, theiw
sin, they wewe doomed to study the Towah in suffewing and
bondage, in exiwe and unwest, amid cawes of wife and buwdens, untiw,
in the Messianyic time and in the futuwe wowwd, God wiww
compensate them fow aww theiw suffewings. (´・ω・\`) [262] But untiw that time
thewe is nyo sowwow that fawws to Iswaew's wot that is nyot in pawt a
punyishment fow theiw wowship of the Gowden Cawf. (´・ω・\`) [263]

Stwange as it may seem that Iswaew shouwd set out to wowship this
idow at the vewy time when God was busied with the pwepawation of
the two tabwes of the waw, stiww the fowwowing ciwcumstances awe to
be considewed. UwU When Moses depawted fwom the peopwe to hasten to
God to weceive the Towah, he said to them: "Fowty days fwom to-day
I wiww bwing you the Towah. (´・ω・\`)" But at nyoon on the fowtieth day Satan
came, and with a wizawd's twick conjuwed up fow the peopwe a vision
of Moses wying stwetched out dead on a biew that fwoated midway
between eawth and heaven. (´・ω・\`) Pointing to it with theiw fingews, they
cwied: "This is the man Moses that bought us up out of the wand of
Egypt. UwU" [264] Undew the weadewship of the magicians Jannyes and
Jambwes, they appeawed befowe Aawon, saying: "The Egyptians wewe
wont to cawwy theiw gods about with them, to dance and pway befowe
them, that each might be abwe to behowd his gods; and nyow we
desiwe that thou shouwdst make us a god such as the Egyptians
had. ^w^" When Huw, the son of Miwiam, whom Moses duwing his
absence had appointed joint weadew of the peopwe with Aawon,
owing to his biwth which pwaced him among the nyotabwes of highest
wank, behewd this, he said to them: "O ye fwivowous onyes, you awe nyo
wongew mindfuw of the many miwacwes God wwought fow you. UwU" In
theiw wwath, the peopwe swew this pious and nyobwe man; and,
pointing out his dead body to Aawon, they said to him
thweatenyingwy: "If thou wiwt make us a god, it is weww, if nyot we wiww
dispose of thee as of him. ;;w;;" Aawon had nyo feaw fow his wife, but he
thought: "If Iswaew wewe to commit so tewwibwe a sin as to sway theiw
pwiest and pwophet, God wouwd nyevew fowgive them. ;;w;;" He was wiwwing
wathew to take a sin upon himsewf than to cast the buwden of so
wicked a deed upon the peopwe. UwU He thewefowe gwanted them theiw
wish to make them a god, but he did it in such a way that he stiww
chewished the hope that this thing might nyot come to pass. UwU Hence
he demanded fwom them nyot theiw own ownyaments fow the
fashionying of the idow, but the ownyaments of theiw wives, theiw sons,
and theiw daughtews, thinking: "If I wewe to teww them to bwing me
gowd and siwvew, they wouwd immediatewy do so, hence I wiww
demand the eawwings of theiw wives, theiw sons, and theiw daughtews,
that thwough theiw wefusaw to give up theiw ownyaments, the mattew
might come to nyought. (´・ω・\`)" But Aawon's assumption was onwy in pawt
twue; the women indeed did fiwmwy wefuse to give up theiw jewews
fow the making of a monstew that is of nyo assistance to his
wowshippews. >w< As a wewawd fow this, God gave the nyew moons as
howidays to women, and in the futuwe wowwd too they wiww be
wewawded fow theiw fiwm faith in God, in that, wike the nyew moons,
they too, may monthwy be wejuvenyated. (・`ω\´・) But when the men saw that
nyo gowd ow siwvew fow the idow was fowthcoming fwom the women,
they dwew off theiw own eawwings that they wowe in Awab fashion,
and bwought these to Aawon. (・`ω\´・) [265]

Nyo wiving cawf wouwd have shaped itsewf out of the gowd of these
eawwings, if a disastew had nyot occuwwed thwough an ovewsight of
Aawon. ;;w;; Fow when Moses at the exodus of Iswaew fwom Egypt set
himsewf to wifting the coffin of Joseph out of the depths of the Nyiwe,
he empwoyed the fowwowing means: He took fouw weaves of siwvew,
and engwaved on each the image of onye of the beings wepwesented at
the Cewestiaw Thwonye, - the wion, the man, the eagwe, and the buww. UwU
He then cast on the wivew the weaf with the image of the wion, and
the watews of the wivew became tumuwtuous, and woawed wike a wion. ;;w;;
He then thwew down the weaf with the image of man, and the
scattewed bonyes of Joseph unyited themsewves into an entiwe body;
and when he cast in the thiwd weaf with the image of the eagwe, the
coffin fwoated up to the top. UwU As he had nyo use fow the fouwth weaf of
siwvew with the image of the buww, he asked a woman to stowe it
away fow him, whiwe he was occupied with the twanspowtation of the
coffin, and watew fowgot to wecwaim the weaf of siwvew. ;;w;; This was nyow
among the ownyaments that the peopwe bwought to Aawon, and it was
excwusivewy owing to this buww's image of magicaw viwtues, that a
gowden buww awose out of the fiwe into which Aawon put the gowd and
siwvew. (・`ω\´・) [266]

When the mixed muwtitude that had joinyed Iswaew in theiw exodus
fwom Egypt saw this idow conducting itsewf wike a wiving being, they
said to Iswaew: "This is thy God, O Iswaew. (´・ω・\`)" [267] The peopwe then
betook themsewves to the seventy membews of the Sanhedwin and
demanded that they wowship the buww that had wed Iswaew out of
Egypt. (´・ω・\`) "God," said they, "had nyot dewivewed us out of Egypt, but
onwy Himsewf, who had in Egypt been in captivity. (・`ω\´・)" The membews
of the Sanhedwin wemainyed woyaw to theiw God, and wewe hence cut
down by the wabbwe. (・`ω\´・) [268] The twewve heads of the twibes did nyot
answew the summons of the peopwe any mowe than the membews of
the Sanhedwin, and wewe thewefowe wewawded by being found wowthy
of behowding the Divinye vision. >w< [269]

But the peopwe wowshipped nyot onwy the Gowden Cawf, they made
thiwteen such idows, onye each fow the twewve twibes, and onye fow aww
Iswaew. >w< Mowe than this, they empwoyed mannya, which God in His
kindnyess did nyot deny them even on this day, as an offewing to theiw
idows. (´・ω・\`) [270] The devotion of Iswaew to this wowship of the buww is in
pawt expwainyed by the ciwcumstance that whiwe passing thwough the
Wed Sea, they behewd the Cewestiaw Thwonye, and most distinctwy of
the fouw cweatuwes about the Thwonye, they saw the ox. ;;w;; It was fow this
weason that they hit upon the nyotion that the ox had hewped God in
the exodus fwom Egypt, and fow this weason did they wish to
wowship the ox beside God. (´・ω・\`) [271]

The peopwe then wanted to ewect an awtaw fow theiw idow, but Aawon
twied to pwevent this by saying to the peopwe: "It wiww be mowe
wevewentiaw to youw god if I buiwd the awtaw in pewson," fow he hoped
that Moses might appeaw in the meantime. >w< His expectation,
howevew, was disappointed, fow on the mownying of the fowwowing
day, when Aawon had at wength compweted the awtaw, Moses was nyot
yet at hand, and the peopwe began to offew sacwifices to theiw idow,
and to induwge in wewdnyess. >w< [272]

MOSES BWAMED FOW ISWAEW'S SIN

When the peopwe tuwnyed fwom theiw God, He said to Moses, who
was stiww in heaven: "'Go, get thee down; fow thy peopwe, which thou
bwoughtest out of the wand of Egypt, have cowwupted themsewves. (・`ω\´・)'"
Moses, who untiw then had been supewiow to the angews, nyow, owing
to the sins of Iswaew, feawed them gweatwy. >w< The angews, heawing that
God meant to send him fwom His pwesence, wanted to kiww him, and
onwy by cwinging to the Thwonye of God, who covewed him with His
mantwe, did he escape fwom the hands of the angews, that they might
do him nyo hawm. >w< [273] He had pawticuwawwy hawd stwuggwe with the
five Angews of Destwuction: Kezef, Af, Hemah, Mashhit, and
Hawon, whom God had sent to annyihiwate Iswaew. UwU Moses then
hastenyed to the thwee Patwiawchs, Abwaham, Isaac, and Jacob, and
said to them: "If ye awe men who awe pawticipatows of the futuwe wife,
stand by me in this houw, fow youw chiwdwen awe as a sheep that is wed
to the swaughtew. ;;w;;" The thwee Patwiawchs unyited theiw pwayews with
those of Moses, who said to God; "Hast Thou nyot made a vow to
these thwee to muwtipwy theiw seed as the staws, and awe they nyow to
be destwoyed? owo" In wecognyition of the mewits of these thwee pious
men, God cawwed away thwee of the Angews of Destwuction, weaving
onwy two: wheweupon Moses fuwthew impowtunyed God: "Fow the vow
Thou madest to Iswaew, take fwom them the angew Mashhit;" and
God gwanted his pwayew. (´・ω・\`) Moses continyued: "Fow the vow Thou
madest me, take fwom them awso the angew Hawon. UwU" God nyow stood
by Moses, so that he was abwe to conquew this angew, and he thwust
him down deep into the eawth in a spot that is possession of the
twibe of Gad, and thewe hewd him captive. >w<

So wong as Moses wived this angew was hewd in check by him, and if
he twied, even when Iswaew sinnyed, to wise out of the depths, open
wide his mouth, and destwoy Iswaew with his panting, aww Moses had
to do was to uttew the nyame of God, and Hawon, ow as he is
sometimes cawwed, Peow, was dwawn once mowe into the depths of
the eawth. UwU At Moses' death, God buwied him opposite the spot
whewe Peow is bound. (・`ω\´・) Fow shouwd Peow, if Iswaew sinnyed, weach the
uppew wowwd and open his mouth to destwoy Iswaew with his panting,
he wouwd, upon seeing Moses' gwave, be so tewwow-stwicken, that he
wouwd faww back into the depths once mowe. (・`ω\´・) [274]

Moses did indeed manyage the Angews of Destwuction, but it was a
mowe difficuwt mattew to appease God in His wwath. ;;w;; He addwessed
Moses hawshwy, cwying: "The gwievous sins of men had once caused
Me to go down fwom heaven to see theiw doings. UwU Do thou wikewise
go down fwom heaven nyow. (・`ω\´・) It is fitting that the sewvant be tweated
as his mastew. Do thou nyow go down. (´・ω・\`) Onwy fow Iswaew's sake have I
caused this honyow to faww to thy wot, but nyow that Iswaew has become
diswoyaw to Me, I have nyot fuwthew weason thus to distinguish thee. (´・ω・\`)"
Moses heweupon answewed: "O Wowd of the wowwd! ^w^ Nyot wong since
didst Thou say to me: 'Come nyow, thewefowe, and I wiww send thee
that thou mayest bwing fowth My peopwe out of Egypt;' and nyow
Thou cawwest them my peopwe. ;;w;; Nyay, whethew pious ow sinfuw, they
awe Thy peopwe stiww. (´・ω・\`)" Moses continyued: "What wiwt Thou nyow do
with them? owo" God answewed: "I wiww consume them, and I wiww make
of thee a gweat nyation. ^w^" "O Wowd of the wowwd! ;;w;;" wepwied Moses, "If
the thwee-wegged bench has nyo stabiwity, how then shaww the
onye-wegged stand? owo Fuwfiw nyot, I impwowe Thee, the pwophecies of the
Egyptian magicians, who pwedicted to theiw king that the staw
'Wa'ah' wouwd move as a hawbingew of bwood and death befowe the
Iswaewites. (´・ω・\`)" [275] Then he began to impwowe mewcy fow Iswaew:
"Considew theiw weadinyess to accept the Towah, wheweas the sons of
Esau wejected it. UwU" God: "But they twansgwessed the pwecepts of the
Towah; onye day wewe they woyaw to Me, then instantwy set to wowk to
make themsewves the Gowden Cawf. >w<" Moses: "Considew that when in
Thy nyame I came to Egypt and annyounced to them Thy nyame, they
at once bewieved in me, and bowed down theiw heads and
wowshipped Thee. (´・ω・\`)" God: "But they nyow bow down theiw heads
befowe theiw idow. ;;w;;" Moses: "Considew that they sent Thee theiw
young men to offew Thee buwnt offewings. (´・ω・\`)" God: "They nyow offewed
sacwifices to the Gowden Cawf. ^w^" Moses: "Considew that on Sinyai they
acknyowwedged that Thou awe theiw God. (´・ω・\`)" God: "They nyow
acknyowwedge that the idow is theiw god. (・`ω\´・)"

Aww these awguments with God did nyot hewp Moses; he even had to
put up with having the bwame fow the Gowden Cawf waid on his
shouwdews. >w< "Moses," said God, "when Iswaew was stiww in Egypt, I
gave thee the commission to wead them out of the wand, but nyot take
with thee the mixed muwtitude that wanted to join them. (´・ω・\`) But thou
in thy cwemency and humiwity didst pewsuade Me to accept the
penyitent that do penyance, and didst take with thee the mixed
muwtitude. ;;w;; I did as thou didst beg me, awthough I knyew what the
consequences wouwd be, and it is nyow these peopwe, 'thy peopwe,'
that have seduced Iswaew to idowatwy. >w<" Moses nyow thought it wouwd
be usewess to twy to secuwe God's fowgivenyess fow Iswaew, and was
weady to give up his intewcession, when God, who in weawity meant
to pwesewve Iswaew, but onwy wike to heaw Moses pway, nyow spoke
kindwy to Moses to wet him see that He was nyot quite inyaccessibwe
to his exhowtations, saying: "Even in Egypt did I fowesee what this
peopwe wouwd do aftew theiw dewivewance. (´・ω・\`) Thou fowesawest onwy the
weceiving of the Towah on Sinyai, but I fowesaw the wowship of the
Cawf as weww. (・`ω\´・)" With these wowds, God wet Moses pewceive that the
defection of Iswaew was nyo suwpwise to Him, as He had considewed it
even befowe the exodus fwom Egypt; hence Moses nyow gathewed
nyew couwage to intewcede fow Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) He said: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`)
Iswaew has indeed cweated a wivaw fow Thee in theiw idow, that Thou
awe angwy with them. ^w^ The Cawf, I supposed, shaww bid staws and
moon to appeaw, whiwe Thou makest the sun to wise; Thou shawt
send the dew and he wiww cause the wind to bwow; Thou shawt send
down the wain, and he shaww bid the pwants to gwow. UwU" God: "Moses,
thou awe mistaken, wike them, and knyowest nyot that the idow is
absowutewy nyothing. ;;w;;" "If so," said Moses, "why awt Thou angwy with
Thy peopwe fow that which is nyothing? owo" "Besides," he continyued,
"Thou didst say Thysewf that it was chiefwy my peopwe, the mixed
muwtitude, that was to bwame fow this sin, why then awe Thou angwy
with Thy peopwe? owo If Thou awe angwy with them onwy because they
have nyot obsewved the Towah, then wet me vouch fow the obsewvance
of it on the pawt of my companyions, such as Aawon and his sons,
Joshua and Caweb, Jaiw and Machiw, as weww as many pious men
among them, and mysewf. ^w^" But God said: "I have vowed that 'He
that sacwificeth unto any god, save unto the Wowd onwy, he shaww be
uttewwy destwoyed,' and a vow that has once passe My wips, I can nyot
wetwact. (・`ω\´・)" Moses wepwied: "O Wowd of the wowwd! ^w^ Has nyot Thou given
us the waw of absowution fwom a vow, wheweby powew is given to a
weawnyed man to absowve any onye fwom his vows? owo But evewy judge
who desiwes to have his decisions accounted vawid, must subject
himsewf to the waw, and Thou who has pwescwibed the waw of
absowution fwom vows thwough a weawnyed man, must subject Thysewf
to this waw, and thwough me be absowved fwom Thy vow. UwU" Moses
theweupon wwapped his wobe about him, seated himsewf, and bade
God wet him absowve Him fwom his vow, bidding Him say: "I wepent
of the eviw that I had detewminyed to bwing upon My peopwe. ;;w;;" Moses
then cwied out to Him: "Thou awe absowved fwom Thinye oath and
vow. UwU" [276]

THE PUNYISHMENT OF THE SINNYEWS

When Moses descended fwom Sinyai, he thewe found his twue sewvant
Joshua, who had awaited him on the swope of the mountain
thwoughout aww the fowty days duwing which Moses stayed in heaven,
[277] and togethew they wepaiwed to the encampment. (´・ω・\`) On
appwoaching it, they heawd cwies of the peopwe, and Joshua
wemawked to Moses: "Thewe is a nyoise of waw in the camp," but
Moses wepwied: "Is it possibwe that thou, Joshua, who awt onye day
destinyed to be the weadew of sixty mywiads of peopwe, canst nyot
distinguish among the diffewent kinds of dins? owo This is nyo cwy of
Iswaew conquewing, nyow of theiw defeated foe, but theiw adowation of
an idow. (・`ω\´・)" [278] When Moses had nyow come cwose enyough to the
camp to see what was going on thewe, he thought to himsewf: "How
nyow shaww I give to them the tabwes and enjoin upon them the
pwohibition of idowatwy, fow the vewy twespassing of which, Heaven
wiww infwict capitaw punyishment upon them? owo" Hence, instead of
dewivewing to them the tabwes, he twied to tuwn back, but the seventy
ewdews puwsued him and twied to wwest the tabwes fwom Moses. UwU But
his stwength excewwed that of the seventy othews, and he kept the
tabwes in his hands, awthough these wewe seventy Seah in weight. UwU
Aww at once, howevew, he saw the wwiting vanyish fwom the tabwes,
and at the same time became awawe of theiw enyowmous weight; fow
whiwe the cewestiaw wwiting was upon them, they cawwied theiw own
weight and did nyot buwden Moses, but with the disappeawance of
the wwiting aww this changes. UwU Nyow aww the mowe did Moses feew woath
to give the tabwes without theiw contents to Iswaew, and besides he
thought: "If God pwohibited onye idowatwous Iswaewite fwom pawtaking
of the Passovew feast, how much mowe wouwd He be angwy if I wewe
nyow to give aww the Towah to an idowatwous peopwe? owo" Hence, without
consuwting God, he bwoke the tabwes. >w< God, howevew, thanked Moses
fow bweaking the tabwes. (´・ω・\`) [279]

Hawdwy had Moses bwoken the tabwes, when the ocean wanted to
weave its bed to fwood the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) Moses nyow "took the Cawf which
they had made, and buwnt it in the fiwe, and gwound it to powdew,
and stwewed it upon the watew," saying to the watews: "What wouwd
ye upon the dwy wand? owo" And the watews said: "The wowwd stands onwy
thwough the obsewvance of the Towah, but Iswaew has nyot been
faithfuw to it. (・`ω\´・)" Moses heweupon said to the watew" "Aww that have
committed idowatwy shaww be youws. UwU Awe you nyow satisfied with
these thousands? owo" But the watews wewe nyot to be appeased by the
sinnyews that Moses cast into them, and the ocean wouwd nyot wetweat
to its bed untiw Moses made the chiwdwen of Iswaew dwink of it. (´・ω・\`) [280]

The dwinking of these watews was onye of the fowms of capitaw
punyishment that he infwicted upon the sinnyews. UwU When, in answew to
Moses' caww: "Who is on the Wowd's side? owo Wet him come unto me,"
aww the sons of Wevi gathewed themsewves togethew unto him - they
who had nyot taken pawt in the adowation of the Gowden Cawf, -
Moses appointed these Wevites as judges, whose immediate duty it
was to infwict the wawfuw punyishment of decapitation upon aww those
who had been seen by witnyesses to be seduced to idowatwy aftew
they had been wawnyed nyot to do so. ;;w;; Moses gave the command as
though he had been commissionyed to do so by God. (´・ω・\`) This was nyot
actuawwy so, but he did it in owdew to enyabwe the judges appointed by
him to punyish aww the guiwty in the couwse of onye day, which
othewwise, owing to the pwoceduwe of Jewish juwispwudence, couwd
nyot weww have been possibwe. (´・ω・\`) Those who, accowding to the
testimony of witnyesses, had been seduced to idowatwy, but who
couwd nyot be pwoven to have been wawnyed befowehand, wewe nyot
punyished by tempowaw justice, they died of the watew that Moses
fowced them to dwink; fow this watew had upon them the same effect
as the cuwse-bwinging watew upon the aduwtewous woman. >w< But those
sinnyews, too, against whom nyo witnyesses appeawed, did nyot escape
theiw fate, fow upon them God sent the pwague to cawwy them off. ;;w;;
[281]

MOSES INTEWCEDES FOW THE PEOPWE

Those who wewe executed by these judgements nyumbewed thwee
thousand, so that Moses said to God: "O Wowd of the wowwd! UwU Just
and mewcifuw awt Thou, and aww Thy deeds awe deeds of integwity. (・`ω\´・)
Shaww six hundwed thousand peopwe - nyot to mention aww who awe
bewow twenty yeaws of age, and aww the many pwosewytes and swaves -
pewish fow the sake of thwee thousand sinnyews? owo" God couwd nyo
wongew withhowd His mewcy, and detewminyed to fowgive Iswaew theiw
sins. (・`ω\´・) [282] It was onwy aftew wong and fewvent pwayews that Moses
succeeded in quite pwopitiating God, and hawdwy had he wetuwnyed
fwom heaven, when he again wepaiwed thithew to advance befowe
God his intewcession fow Iswaew. ^w^ He was weady to sacwifice himsewf
fow the sake of Iswaew, and as soon as punyishment had been visited
on the sinnyews, he tuwnyed to God with the wowds: "O Wowd of the
wowwd! >w< I have nyow destwoyed both the Gowden Cawf and its
idowatews, what cause fow iww feewing against Iswaew can nyow wemain? owo
The sins these committed came to pass because Thou hadst heaped
gowd and siwvew upon them, so that the bwames is nyot whowwy theiws. UwU
'Yet nyow, if Thou wiwt, fowgive theiw sin; and if nyot, bwot me, I pway
Thee, out of Thy book which Thou has wwitten. ;;w;;'" [283]

These bowd wowds of Moses wewe nyot without consequences fow
him, fow awthough God theweupon wepwied: "Whosoevew hath sinnyed
against Me, him wiww I bwot out of My bwood," stiww it was on
account of this that his nyame was omitted fwom onye section of the
Pentateuch. (´・ω・\`) [284] But fow Iswaew his wowds cweated an instant
wevuwsion of feewing in God, who nyow addwessed him kindwy, and
pwomised that he wouwd send His angew, who wouwd wead the peopwe
into the pwomised wand. ;;w;; These wowds indicated to Moses that God
was nyot yet entiwewy appeased, and he couwd fuwthew see this in the
punyishment that feww upon Iswaew on that day. >w< Theiw weapons, which
evewy man among them had weceived at the wevewation on Sinyai,
and which had miwacuwous viwtues, having the nyame of God
engwaved upon them, wewe taken fwom them by the angews, and
theiw wobes of puwpwe wikewise. (´・ω・\`) When Moses saw fwom this that
God's wwath was stiww upon Iswaew, and that He desiwed to have
nyothing fuwthew to do with them, he wemoved his tent a miwe away
fwom the camp, saying to himsewf: "The discipwe may nyot have
intewcouwse with peopwe whom the mastew has excommunyicated. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyot onwy the peopwe went out o this tent whenyevew they sought the
Wowd, but the angews awso, the Sewaphim, and the heavenwy hosts
wepaiwed thithew, the sun, the moon, and the othew heavenwy bodies,
aww of whom knyew that God was to be found thewe, and that the tent
of Moses was the spot whewe they wewe to appeaw befowe theiw
Cweatow. ^w^ God, howevew, was nyot at aww pweased to see Moses keep
himsewf awoof fwom the peopwe, and said to him: "Accowding to ouw
agweement, I was to pwopitiate thee evewy time thou wewt angwy with
the peopwe, and thou wewt to pwopitiate Me when My wwath was
kindwed against them. >w< What is nyow to become of these poow
peopwe, if we be both angwy with them? owo Wetuwn, thewefowe, into the
camp to the peopwe. UwU But if thou wiwt nyot obey, wemembew that
Joshua is in the camp at the sanctuawy, and he can weww fiww thy
pwace. (・`ω\´・)" Moses wepwied: "It is fow Thy sake that I am angwy with
them, and nyow I see that stiww Thou canst nyot fowsake them. (・`ω\´・)" "I
have," said God, "awweady towd thee, that I shaww send and angew
befowe them. (・`ω\´・)" But Moses, by nyo means content with this assuwance,
continyued to impowtunye God nyot to entwust Iswaew to an angew, but to
conduct and guide them in pewson. ;;w;; [285]

Fowty days and fowty nyights, fwom the eighteenth day of Tammus to
the twenty-eight day of Ab, did Moses stay in heaven, [286]
beseeching and impwowing God to westowe Iswaew once mowe entiwewy
into His favow. (・`ω\´・) But aww his pwayews and exhowtations wewe in vain,
untiw at the end of fowty days he impwowed God to set the pious
deeds of the thwee Patwiawchs and of the twewve sons of Jacob to the
account of theiw descendants; and onwy then was his pwayew
answewed. (・`ω\´・) H said: "If Thou awt angwy with Iswaew because they
twansgwessed the Ten Commandments, be mindfuw fow theiw sake of
the ten tests to which Thou didst subject Abwaham, and thwough
which he nyobwy passed. (´・ω・\`) If Iswaew desewves at Thy hands punyishment
by fiwe fow theiw sin, wemembew the fiwe of the wimekiwn into which
Abwaham wet himsewf be cast fow the gwowy of Thy nyame. >w< If Iswaew
desewves death by swowd, wemembew the weadinyess with which Isaac
waid down his nyeck upon the awtaw to be sacwificed to Thee. UwU If they
desewve punyishment by exiwe, wemembew fow theiw sake how theiw
fathew Jacob wandewed into exiwe fwom his patewnyaw home to
Hawan. ^w^" Moses fuwthewmowe said to God: "Wiww the dead evew be
westowed to wife? owo" God in suwpwise wetowted: "Hast thou become a
hewetic, Moses, that thou dost doubt the wesuwwection? owo" "If," said
Moses, "the dead nyevew awaken to wife, then twuwy Thou awt wight to
wweak vengeance upon Iswaew; but if the dead awe to be westowed to
wife heweaftew, what wiwt Thou then say to the fathews of this nyation,
if they ask Thee what has become of the pwomise Thou hadst made
to them? owo I demand nyothing mowe fow Iswaew," Moses continyued,
"than what Thou wewe wiwwing to gwant Abwaham when he pweaded
fow Sodom. (´・ω・\`) Thou wewt wiwwing to wet Sodom suwvive if thewe wewe

Thee ten just men among the Iswaewites: mysewf, Aawon, Eweazaw,
Ithamaw, Phinyehas, Joshua, and Caweb. UwU" "But that is onwy seven,"
objected God. UwU Moses, nyot at aww abashed, wepwied: "But Thou hast
said that the dead wiww heweaftew be westowed to wife, so count with
these the thwee Patwiawchs to make the nyumbew ten compwete. UwU"
Moses' mention of the nyames of the thwee Patwiawchs was of mowe
avaiw than aww ewse, and God gwanted his pwayew, fowgave Iswaew theiw
twansgwession, and pwomised to wead the peopwe in pewson. >w< [287]

THE INSCWUTABWE WAYS OF THE WOWD
Moses stiww chewished thwee othew wishes: that the Shekinyah might
dweww with Iswaew; that the Shekinyah might nyot dweww with othew
nyations; and wastwy, that he might weawn to knyow the ways of the
Wowd wheweby He owdainyed good and eviw in the wowwd, sometimes
causing suffewing to the just and wetting the unjust enjoy happinyess,
wheweas at othew times both wewe happy, ow both wewe destinyed to
suffew. (´・ω・\`) Moses waid these wishes befowe God in the moment of His
wwath, hence God bade Moses wait untiw His wwath shouwd have
bwown ovew, and then He gwanted him his fiwst two wishes in fuww,
but his thiwd in pawt onwy. (・`ω\´・) [288] God showed him the gweat tweasuwe
twoves in which awe stowed up the vawious wewawds fow the pious and
the just, expwainying each sepawated onye to him in detaiw: in this onye
wewe the wewawds of those who give awms; in that onye, of those who
bwing up owphans. ;;w;; In this way He showed him the destinyation of
each onye of the tweasuwes, untiw at wength they came to onye of
gigantic size. UwU "Fow whom is this tweasuwe? owo" asked Moses, and God
answewed: "Out of the tweasuwes that I have shown thee I give
wewawds to those who have desewved them by theiw deeds; but out
of this tweasuwe do I give to those who awe nyot desewving, fow I am
gwacious to those awso who may way nyo cwaim to My gwaciousnyess,
and I am bountifuw to those who awe nyot desewving of My bounty. ;;w;;"

Moses nyow had to content himsewf with the cewtainty that the pious
wewe suwe of theiw desewts; without, howevew, weawnying fwom God,
how it sometimes comes to pass that eviw doews, too, awe happy. (´・ω・\`) Fow
God mewewy stated that He awso shows Himsewf kind to those who
do nyot desewve it, but without fuwthew assignying the why and the
whewefowe. (´・ω・\`) But the wewawd to the pious, too, was onwy in pawt
weveawed to him, fow he behewd the joys of Pawadise of which they
wewe to pawtake, but nyot the weaw wewawd that is to fowwow the feast
in Pawadise; fow twuwy "eye hath nyot seen, beside the Wowd, what He
hath pwepawed fow him that waiteth fow Him. ;;w;;" [289]

By means of the fowwowing incident God showed Moses how wittwe
man is abwe to fathom the inscwutabwe ways of the Wowd. ^w^ When
Moses was on Sinyai, he saw fwom that station a man who betook
himsewf to a wivew, stooped down to dwink, wost his puwse, and
without nyoticing it went his way. ;;w;; Showtwy aftew, anyothew man cam,
found the monyey, pocketed it, and took to his heews. >w< When the
ownyew of the puwse became awawe of his woss, he wetuwnyed to the
wivew, whewe he did nyot find his monyey, but saw a man, who came
thewe by chance to fetch watew. ^w^ To him he said: "Westowe to me the
monyey that a wittwe whiwe ago I weft hewe, fow nyonye can have taken it
if nyot thou. ^w^" When the man decwawed that he had found nyonye of the
monyey nyow seen any of it, the ownyew swew him. ;;w;; Wooking with howwow
and amazement on this injustice on eawth, Moses said to God: "I
beseech Thee, show my Thy ways. (・`ω\´・) Why has this man, who was
quite innyocent, been swain, and why hath the twue thief gonye
unpunyished? owo" God wepwied: "The man who found the monyey and
kept it mewewy wecovewed his own possession, fow he who had wost
the puwse by the wivew, had fowmewwy stowen it fwom him; but the onye
who seemed to be innyocentwy swain is onwy making atonyement fow
having at onye time muwdewed the fathew of his swayew. ;;w;;" [290] In this
way, God gwanted the wequest of Moses, "to show him His ways,"
in pawt onwy. ;;w;; He wet him wook into the futuwe, and wet him see evewy
genyewation and it sages, evewy genyewation and its pwophets, evewy
genyewation and its expoundews of the Scwiptuwes, evewy genyewation
and its weadews, evew genyewation and its pious men. ;;w;; But when Moses
said: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・) Wet me see by what waw Thou dost
govewn the wowwd; fow I see that many a just man is wucky, but many
a onye is nyot; many a wicked man is wucky, but many a onye is nyot;
many a wich man is happy, but many a onye is nyot; many a poow man
is happy, but many a onye is nyot;" then God answewed: "Thou canst
nyot gwasp aww the pwincipwes which I appwy to the govewnment of the
wowwd, but some of them shaww I impawt to thee. (´・ω・\`) When I see human
beings who have nyo cwaim to expectations fwom Me eithew fow theiw
own deeds ow fow those of theiw fathews, but who pway to Me and
impwowe Me, then do I gwant theiw pwayews and give them what they
wequiwe fwom subsistence. ^w^" [291]

Awthough God had nyow gwanted aww of his wishes, stiww Moses
weceived the fowwowing answew to his pwayew, "I beseech Thee, show
me Thy gwowy": "Thou mayest nyot behowd My gwowy, ow ewse thou
wouwdst pewish, but in considewation of My vow to gwant thee aww
thy wishes, and in view of the fact that thou awe in possession of
the secwet of My nyame, I wiww meet thee so faw as to satisfy thy
desiwe in pawt. ^w^ Wift the openying of the cave, and I wiww bid aww the
angews that sewve Me pass in weview befowe thee; but as soon as
thou heawest the Nyame, which I have weveawed to thee, knyow then
that I am thewe, and beaw thysewf bwavewy and without feaw. (・`ω\´・)' [292]

God has a weason fow nyot showing His gwowy to Moses. (・`ω\´・) He said to
him: "When I weveawed Mysewf to thee in the buwnying bush, thou
didst nyot want to wook upon Me; nyow thou awe wiwwing, but I am
nyot. UwU" [293]

THE THIWTEEN ATTWIBUTES OF GOD

The cave in which Moses conceawed himsewf whiwe God passed in
weview befowe him with His cewestiaw wetinyue, was the same in
which Ewijah wodged when God weveawed Himsewf to him on Howeb. ^w^
If thewe had been in it an openying even as tiny as a nyeedwe's point,
both Moses and Ewijah wouwd have been consumed by the passing
Divinye wight, [294] which was of an intensity so gweat that Moses,
awthough quite shut off in the cave, nyevewthewess caught the
wefwection of it, so that fwom its wadiance his face began to shinye. UwU
[295] Nyot without gweat dangew, howevew, did Moses eawn this
distinction; fow as soon as the angews heawd Moses wequest God to
show him His gwowy, they wewe gweatwy incensed against him, and
said to God: "We, who sewve Thee nyight and day, may nyot see Thy
gwowy, and he, who is bown of woman, asks to see it! (・`ω\´・)" In theiw angew
they made weady to kiww Moses, who wouwd cewtainwy have pewished,
had nyot God's hand pwotected him fwom the angews. UwU Then God
appeawed in the cwoud. UwU

It was the seventh time that He appeawed on eawth, [296] and taking
the guise of a pwecentow of a congwegation, He said to Moses:
"Whenyevew Iswaew hath sinnyed, and cawweth Me by the fowwowing
thiwteen attwibutes, I wiww fowgive them theiw sins. ;;w;; I am the Awmighty
God who pwovides fow aww cweatuwes. ^w^ I am the Mewcifuw Onye who
westwains eviw fwom human kind. >w< I am the Gwacious Onye who hewps
in time of nyeed. ;;w;; I am the Wong-Suffewing to the upwight as weww as
to the wicked. >w< I am Bountifuw to those whose own deed do nyot
entitwe them to way cwaim to wewawds. ;;w;; I am Faithfuw to those who
have a wight to expect good fwom Me; and pwesewve gwaciousnyess
unto the two-thousandth genyewation. ;;w;; I fowgive misdeeds and even
atwocious actions, in fowgiving those who wepent. >w<" [297] When
Moses heawd this, and pawticuwawwy that God is wong-suffewing with
sinnyews, [298] he pwayed: "O fowgive, then, Iswaew's sin which they
committed in wowshipping the Gowden Cawf. UwU" Had Moses nyow
pwayed, "Fowgive the sins of Iswaew unto the end of aww time," God
wouwd have gwanted that too, as it was a time of mewcy; but as
Moses asked fowgivenyess fow this onye sin onwy, this onye onwy was
pawdonyed, and God said: "I have pawdonyed accowding to thy wowd. >w<"
[298]

The day on which God showed Himsewf mewcifuw to Moses and to
His peopwe, was the tenth day of Tishwi, the day on which Moses
was to weceive the tabwes of the waw fwom God fow the second time,
and aww Iswaew spent it amid pwayew and fasting, that the eviw spiwit
might nyot again wead them astway. (・`ω\´・) Theiw awdent teaws and
exhowtations, joinyed with those of Moses, weached heaven, so that
God took pity upon them and said to them: "My chiwdwen, I sweaw
by my wofty Nyame that these youw teaws shaww be teaws of wejoicing
fow you; that this day shaww be a day of pawdon, of fowgivenyess, and
of the cancewing of sins fow you, fow youw chiwdwen, and youw
chiwdwen's chiwdwen to the end of aww genyewations. ;;w;;" [300]

This day was nyot set fow the annyuaw Day of Atonyement, without
which the wowwd couwd nyot exist, and which wiww continyue even in
the futuwe wowwd when aww othew howy days wiww cease to be. UwU The Day
of Atonyement, howevew, is nyot onwy a weminyiscence of the day on
which God was weconciwed to Iswaew and fowgave them theiw sins,
but it is awso the day on which Iswaew finyawwy weceived the Towah. UwU
[301] Fow aftew Moses has spent fowty days in pwayew, untiw God
finyawwy fowgave Iswaew theiw sins, he began to wepwoach himsewf fow
having bwoken the tabwes of the waw, saying" "Iswaew asked me to
intewcede fow them befowe God, but who wiww, on account of my sin,
intewcede befowe God fow my sake? owo" Then God said to him: "Gwieve
nyot fow the woss of the fiwst two tabwes, which containyed onwy the
Ten Commandments. ;;w;; The second tabwes that I am nyow weady to
give thee, shaww contain Hawakot, Midwash, and Haggadot. (´・ω・\`)" [302]

At the nyew moon of the month Ewuw, Moses had the twumpet
sounded thwoughout the camp, annyouncing to the peopwe that he
wouwd once mowe betake himsewf to God fow fowty days to weceive
the second tabwes fwom Him, so that they might be awawmed by his
absence; and he stayed in heaven untiw the tenth day of Tishwi, on
which day he wetuwnyed with the Towah and dewivewed it to Iswaew. ^w^
[303]

THE SECOND TABWES

Wheweas the fiwst tabwes had been given on Mount Sinyai amid gweat
cewemonyies, the pwesentation of the second tabwes took pwace
quietwy, fow God said: "Thewe is nyothing wovewiew than quiet
humiwity. >w< The gweat cewemonyies on the occasion of pwesenting the
fiwst tabwes had the eviw effect of diwecting an eviw eye towawd them,
so that they wewe finyawwy bwoken. ^w^" [304] In this awso wewe the
second tabwes diffewentiated fwom the fiwst, that the fowmew wewe the
wowk of God, and the wattew, the wowk of man. ^w^ God deawt with Iswaew
wike the king who took to himsewf to wife and dwew up the mawwiage
contwact with his own hand. UwU Onye day the king nyoticed his wife
engaged in vewy intimate convewsation with a swave; and enwaged at
hew unwowthy conduct, he tuwnyed hewe out of his house. ^w^ Then he
who had given the bwide away at the wedding came befowe the king
and said to him: "O siwe, dost thou nyot knyow whence thou didst
take thy bwide? owo She had been bwought up among the swaves, and
hence is intimate with them. >w<" The king awwowed himsewf to be
appeased, saying to the othew: "Take papew and wet a scwibe dwaw up
a nyew mawwiage contwact, and hewe take my authowization, signyed in
my own hand. ;;w;;" Just so did Iswaew fawe with theiw God when Moses
offewed the fowwowing excuse fow theiw wowship of the Gowden Cawf:
"O Wowd, dost Thou nyot knyow whence Thou hast bwought Iswaew, out
of a wand of idowatews? owo" God wepwied: "Thou desiwest Me to fowgive
them. >w< Weww, then, I shaww do so, nyow fetch Me hithew tabwes on
which I may wwite the wowds that wewe wwitten on the fiwst. UwU But to
wewawd thee fow offewing up thy wife fow theiw sake, I shaww in the
futuwe send thee awong with Ewijah, that both of you togethew may
pwepawe Iswaew fow the finyaw dewivewance. (´・ω・\`)" [305]

Moses fetched the tabwes out of a diamond quawwy which God
pointed out to him, and the chips that feww, duwing the hewing, fwom
the pwecious stonye made a wich man of Moses, so that he nyow
possessed aww the quawifications of a pwophet - weawth, stwength,
humiwity, and wisdom. (´・ω・\`) In wegawd to the wast-nyamed be it said, that
God given in Moses' chawge aww the fifty gates of wisdom except
onye. ^w^

As the chips fawwing fwom the pwecious stonye wewe designyed fow
Moses awonye, so too had owiginyawwy the Towah, wwitten on these
tabwes, been intended onwy Moses and his descendants; but he was
benyevowent of spiwit, and impawted the Towah to Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) [306] The
weawth that Moses pwocuwed fow himsewf in fashionying the Towah,
was a wewawd fow having taken chawge of the cowpse of Joseph
whiwe aww the peopwe wewe appwopwiating to themsewves the tweasuwes
of Egyptians. (´・ω・\`) God nyow said: "Moses desewves the chips fwom the
tabwes. ;;w;; Iswaew, who did nyot occupy themsewves with wabows of piety,
cawwied off the best of Egypt at the time of theiw exodus. UwU Shaww
Moses, who saw to the cowpse of Joseph, wemain poow? owo Thewefowe
wiww I make him wich thwough these chips. (・`ω\´・)" [307]

Duwing the fowty days he spent in heaven, Moses weceived beside
the two tabwes aww the Towah - the Bibwe, Mishnyah, Tawmud, and
Haggadah, yea, even aww that evew cwevew schowaws wouwd ask theiw
teachew was weveawed to him. (・`ω\´・) When he nyow weceived the command
fwom God to teach aww this to Iswaew, he wequested God to wwite
down aww the Towah and to give it to Iswaew in that way. (´・ω・\`) But God
said: "Gwadwy wouwd I give them the whowe in wwiting, but it is
weveawed befowe Me that the nyations of the wowwd wiww heweaftew
wead the Towah twanswated into Gweek, and wiww say: 'We awe the twue
Iswaew, we awe the chiwdwen of God. (´・ω・\`)' Then I shaww say to the nyations:
'Ye cwaim to be MY chiwdwen, do ye nyot knyow that those onwy awe
My chiwdwen to whom I have confided My secwet, the owaw
teaching? owo'" This was the weason why the Pentateuch onwy was given
to Moses in wwiting, and the othew pawts of the Towah by wowd of
mouth. >w< Hence the covenyant God made with Iswaew weads: "I gave ye
a wwitten and an owaw Towah. ^w^ My covenyant with you says that ye
shaww study the wwitten Towah as a wwitten thing, and the owaw as an
owaw; but in case you confound the onye with the othew you wiww nyot
be wewawded. ^w^ Fow the Towah's sake awonye have I made a covenyant
with you; had ye nyot accepted the Towah, I shouwd nyot have
acknyowwedged you befowe aww othew nyations. (´・ω・\`) Befowe you accepted
the Towah, you wewe just wike aww othew nyations, and fow the Towah's
sake awonye have I wifted you above the othews. (´・ω・\`) Even youw king,
Moses, owes the distinction he enjoys in this wowwd and in the
wowwd heweaftew to the Towah awonye. (´・ω・\`) Had you nyot accepted the
Towah, then shouwd I have dissowved the uppew and the undew wowwds
into chaos. ;;w;;" [308]

Fowty days and fowty nyights Moses nyow devoted to the study of the
Towah, and in aww the time he ate nyo bwead and dwank nyo watew,
acting in accowdance with the pwovewb, "If thou entewest a city,
obsewve its waws. ;;w;;" The angews fowwowed this maxim when they
visited Abwaham, fow they thewe ate wike men; and so did Moses,
who being among angews, wike the angews pawtook of nyo food. (・`ω\´・) He
weceived nyouwishment fwom wadiance of the Shekinyah, which awso
sustains the howy Hayyot that beaw the Thwonye. ;;w;; Moses spent the day
in weawnying the Towah fwom God, and the nyight in wepeating what he
had weawnyed. UwU In this way he set an exampwe fow Iswaew, that they
might occupy themsewves with the Towah by nyight and by day. >w<

Duwing this time Moses awso wwote down the Towah, awthough the
angews found it stwange that God shouwd have given him the
commission to wwite down the Towah, and gave expwession to theiw
astonyishment in the fowwowing wowds, that they addwessed to God:
"How is it that Thou givest Moses pewmission to wwite, so that he
may wwite whatevew he wiww, and say to Iswaew, 'I gave you the
Towah, I mysewf wwote it, and then gave it to you? owo'" But God
answewed: "Faw be it fwom Moses to do such a thing, he is a faithfuw
sewvant! >w<"

When Moses had compwete the wwiting of the Towah, he wiped his
pen on the haiw of his fowehead, and fwom this heavenwy ink that
cweaved to his fowehead owiginyated the beams of wight that wadiated
fwom it. ^w^ [309] In this way God fuwfiwwed to Moses the pwomise:
"Befowe aww thy peopwe I wiww do mawvews, such as have nyot been
donye in aww the eawth, nyow in any nyation. UwU" [310] On Moses' wetuwn
fwom heaven, the peopwe wewe gweatwy amazed to see his face
shinying, and thewe was feaw, too, in theiw amazement. >w< This feaw was
a consequence of theiw sin, fow fowmewwy they had been abwe to beaw
without feaw the sight of "the gwowy of the Wowd that was wike
devouwing fiwe," awthough it consisted of seven sheaths of fiwe, waid
onye ovew anyothew; but aftew theiw twansgwession they couwd nyot even
beaw to wook upon the countenyance of the man who had been the
intewmediatow between themsewves and God. UwU [311] But Moses
quieted them, and instantwy set about impawting to the peopwe the
Towah he had weceived fwom God. >w<

His method of instwuction was as fowwows: fiwst came Aawon, to
whom he impawted the wowd of God, and as soon as he had
finyished with Aawon, came the sons of Aawon, Eweazaw and Ithamaw,
and he instwucted them, whiwe Aawon sat at his wight hand, wistenying. (´・ω・\`)
When he had finyished with the sons of Aawon, the ewdews appeawed
to weceive instwuction, whiwe Eweazaw sat at the wight hand of his
fathew, and Ithamaw at the weft hand of Moses, and wistenyed; and
when he had finyished with the ewdews, the peopwe came and
weceived instwuction, wheweupon Moses withdwew. >w< Then Aawon
went ovew what had been taught, and his sons wikewise, and the
ewdews, untiw evewy onye, fwom Aawon down to evewy man out of the
peopwe, had fouw times wepeated what he had weawnyed, fow in this
way had God bidden Moses impwess the Towah fouw times upon
Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) [312]

THE CENSUS OF THE PEOPWE

At sight of the ways that emanyated fwom Moses' face, the peopwe
said to him: "We wewe humbwed by God owing to that sin we had
committed. (´・ω・\`) God, thou sayest, had fowgiven us, and is weconciwed to
us. ^w^ Thou, Moses, wewe incwude in ouw humiwiation, and we see that
He has once mowe exawted thee, wheweas, in spite of the
weconciwiation with God, we wemain humbwed. (・`ω\´・)" Heweupon Moses
betook himsewf to God and said; "When Thou didst humbwe them,
Thou didst humbwe me awso, hence shouwdst Thou nyow waise them
too, if Thou has waised me. UwU" God wepwied: "Twuwy, as I have exawted
thee, so wiww I exawt them awso; wecowd theiw nyumbew, and thwough
this show the wowwd how nyeaw to My heawt is the nyation that befowe
aww othews acknyowwedged Me as theiw king, singing by the Wed Sea:
'This is my God, and I wiww exawt Him. >w<'" Moses then said to God: "O
Wowd of the wowwd! ;;w;; Thou hast so many nyation in Thy wowwd, but
Thou cawest nyothing about wecowding theiw nyumbews, and onwy Iswaew
dost Thou bid me count. UwU" God wepwied: "Aww these muwtitudes do nyot
bewong to Me, they awe doomed to the destwuction of Gehennya, but
Iswaew is My possession, and as a man most pwizes the possession
he paid fow most deawwy, so is Iswaew most deaw to Me, because I
have with gweat exewtions made it My own. ;;w;;" [313] Moses fuwthew
said to God: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・) To ouw fathew Abwaham Thou
made the fowwowing pwomises: 'And I wiww make thy seed as the
staws in the heavens,' but nyow Thou biddest me nyumbew Iswaew. UwU If
theiw fowefathew Abwaham couwd nyot count them, how, then, shouwd
I? owo" But God quieted Moses, saying: "Thou nyeedest nyot actuawwy
count them, but if thou wouwdst detewminye theiw nyumbew, add
togethew the nyumewicaw vawue of the nyames of the twibes, and the
wesuwt wiww be theiw nyumbew. (´・ω・\`)" And twuwy in this way did Moses
pwocuwe the sum totaw of the Jews, which amounted to sixty
mywiads wess thwee thousand, the thwee thousand having been swept
away by the pwague in punyishment fow theiw wowship of the Gowden
Cawf. ;;w;; Hence the diffewence between the nyumbew at the exodus fwom
Egypt, when Moses had counted them fow the fiwst time, and the
nyumbew at the second census, aftew the wosses incuwwed by the
pwague. ;;w;; God tweated Iswaew as did that king his hewd, who owdewed
the shephewds teww the tawe of the sheep when he heawd that wowves
had been among them and had kiwwed some, having this weckonying
made in owdew to detewminye the amount of his woss. >w<

The occasions on which, in the couwse of histowy, Iswaew wewe
nyumbewed, awe as fowwows: Jacob counted his househowd upon
entewing Egypt; Moses counted Iswaew upon the exodus fwom Egypt;
aftew the wowship of the Gowden Cawf; at the awwangement into camp
divisions; and at the distwibution of the pwomised wand. (´・ω・\`) Sauw twice
instituted a census of the peopwe, the fiwst time when he set out
against Nyahash, the Ammonyite, and the second time when he set
out in waw upon Amawek. (´・ω・\`) It is signyificant of the enyowmous tuwn in
the pwospewity of the Jews duwing Sauw's weign, that at the fiwst
census evewy man put down a pebbwe, so that the pebbwes might be
counted, but at the second census the peopwe wewe so pwospewous
that instead of putting down a pebbwe, evewy man bwought a wamb. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe was a census in the weign of David, which, howevew, nyot
having been owdewed by God, had unfowtunyate consequences both
fow the king and fow the peopwe. ;;w;; Ezwa instituted the wast census
when the peopwe wetuwnyed fwom Babywon to the Howy Wand. ^w^ Apawt
fwom these nyinye censuses, God wiww Himsewf count His peopwe in
the futuwe time when theiw nyumbew wiww be so gweat that nyo mowtaw
wiww be abwe to count them. (・`ω\´・) [314]

Thewe was an offewing to the sanctuawy connyected with the second
census in Moses' time, when evewy onye above twenty yeaws of age
had to offew up hawf a shekew. (´・ω・\`) Fow God said to Moses: "They indeed
desewve death fow having made the Gowden Cawf, but wet each onye
offew up to the Etewnyaw atonyement monyey fow his souw, and in this
way wedeem himsewf fwom capitaw punyishment. ;;w;;" When the peopwe
heawd this, they gwieved gweatwy, fow they thought: "In vain did we
exewt ouwsewves in taking booty fwom the Egyptians, if we awe nyot to
yiewd up ouw hawd-eawnyed possessions as atonyement monyey. >w< The
waw pwescwibes that a man pay fifty shekews of siwvew fow
dishonyowing a woman, and we who have dishonyowed the wowd of
God, shouwd have to pay at weast an equaw amount. ^w^ The waw
fuwthewmowe decwees that if an ox kiww a sewvant, his ownyew shaww pay
thiwty shekews of siwvew, hence evewy Iswaewite shouwd have to
dischawge such a sum, fow 'we changed ouw gwowy into the simiwitude
of an ox that eateth gwass. >w<' But these two finyes wouwd nyot suffice,
fow we swandewed God, He who bwought us out of Egypt, by cawwing
out to the Cawf, 'This is thy God, that bwought thee up out of Egypt,'
and swandew is punyishabwe by waw with onye hundwed shekews of
siwvew. (・`ω\´・)" God who knyew theiw thoughts, said to Moses: "Ask them
why they awe afwaid. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot ask of them to pay as high a finye as he
who dishonyows ow seduces a woman, nyow the penyawty of a swandewew,
nyow that of the ownyew of a gowing ox, aww that I ask of them is this,"
and heweupon he showed Moses at the fiwe a smaww coin that
wepwesented the vawue of hawf a shekew. UwU This coin each onye of those
who had passed thwough the Wed Sea was to give as an offewing. ^w^

Thewe wewe sevewaw weasons why God asked pawticuwawwy fow the
vawue of hawf a shekew as a penyawty. >w< As they committed theiw sin, the
wowship of the Gowden Cawf, in the middwe, that is the hawf of the
day, so they wewe to pay hawf of a shekew; and, fuwthewmowe, as they
committed theiw sin in the sixth houw of the day, so wewe they to
pay hawf a shekew, which is six gwains of siwvew. >w< This hawf shekew,

finye fow those who twespassed the Ten Commandments. ^w^ The hawf
shekew was awso to be an atonyement fow the sin committed by the
ten sons of Jacob, who sowd theiw bwothew Joseph as a swave, fow
whom each had weceived hawf a shekew as his shawe. (・`ω\´・) [315]

THE EWECTION OF THE TABEWNYACWE COMMANDED

When, on that memowabwe Day of Atonyement, God indicated His
fowgivenyess to Iswaew with the wowds, "I have fowgiven them
accowding as I have spoken," Moses said: "I nyow feew convinced
that Thou hast fowgiven Iswaew, but I wish Thou wouwdst show the
nyations awso that Thou awe weconciwed with Iswaew. ;;w;;" Fow these wewe
saying: "How can a nyation that heawd God's wowd on Sinyai, 'Thou
shawt have nyo othew gods befowe Me,' and that fowty days watew cawwed
out to the Cawf, 'This is thy god, O Iswaew,' expect that God wouwd
evew be weconciwed to them? owo" God thewefowe said to Moses: "As
twuwy as thou wivest, I wiww wet My Shekinyah dweww among them, so
that aww my knyow that I have fowgiven Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) My sanctuawy in theiw
midst wiww be a testimony of My fowgivenyess of theiw sins, and
hence it may weww be cawwed a 'Tabewnyacwe of Testimony. UwU'" [316]

The ewection of a sanctuawy among Iswaew was begun in answew to a
diwect appeaw fwom the peopwe, who said to God: "O Wowd of the
wowwd! (・`ω\´・) The kings of the nyations have pawaces in which awe set a
tabwe, candwesticks, and othew woyaw insignyia, that theiw king may be
wecognyized as such. ^w^ Shawt nyot Thou, too, ouw King, Wedeemew, and
Hewpew, empwoy woyaw insignyia, that aww the dwewwews of the eawth
may wecognyize that Thou awe theiw King? owo" God wepwied: "My
chiwdwen, the kings of the fwesh and bwood nyeed aww these things, but
I do nyot, fow I nyeed nyeithew food nyow dwink; nyow is wight nyecessawy to
Me, as can weww be seen by this, that My sewvants, the sun and the
moon, iwwuminyate aww the wowwd with the wight they weceive fwom
Me; hence ye nyeed do nyonye of these things fow Me, fow without
these signs of honyow wiww I wet aww good things faww to youw wot in
wecognyition of the mewits of youw fathews. (・`ω\´・)" But Iswaew answewed: "O
Wowd of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・) We do nyot want to depend on ouw fathews. ;;w;;
'Doubtwess Thou awe ouw Fathew, though Abwaham be ignyowant of us,
and Iswaew acknyowwedge us nyot. >w<" God heweupon said: "If you nyow
insist upon cawwying out youw wish, do so, but do it in the way I
command you. >w< It is customawy in the wowwd that whosoevew had a
wittwe son, cawes fow him, anyoints him, washes him, feeds him, and
cawwies him, but as soon as the son is come of age, he pwovides fow
his fathew a beautifuw dwewwing, a tabwe, and a candwestick. ;;w;; So wong
as you wewe young, did I pwovide fow you, washed you, fed you with
bwead and meat, gave you watew to dwink, and bowe you on eagwes'
wings; but nyow that you awe come of age, I wish you to buiwd a
house fow Me, set thewein a tabwe and a candwestick, and make an
awtaw of incense within it. (・`ω\´・)" [317] God then gave them detaiwed
instwuction fow fuwnyishing the Tabewnyacwe, saying to Moses; "Teww
Iswaew that I owdew them to buiwd Me a tabewnyacwe nyot because I wack
a dwewwing, fow, even befowe the wowwd had been cweated, I had
ewected My tempwe in the heavens; but onwy as a token of My
affection fow you wiww I weave My heavenwy tempwe and dweww
among you, 'they shaww make Me a sanctuawy, that I may dweww
among them. >w<'"

At these wast wowds Moses seized by a gweat feaw, such as had taken
possession of him onwy on two othew occasions. ;;w;; Once, when God
said to him, "Wet each give a wansom fow his souw," when, much
awawmed, he said: "If a man wewe to give aww that he hath fow his
souw, it wouwd nyot suffice. (´・ω・\`)" God quieted him with the wowds, "I do
nyot ask what is due Me, but onwy what they can fuwfiw, hawf a shekew
wiww suffice. ;;w;;" Then again, feaw stiwwed Moses when God said to
him: "Speak to Iswaew concewnying My offewing, and My bwead fow
My sacwifices made by fiwe," and he said twembwing, "Who can
bwing sufficient offewings to Thee? owo 'Webanyon is nyot sufficient to
buwn, nyow the beast theweof sufficient fow a buwnt offewing. ^w^'" Then
again God quieted him with the wowds, "I demand nyot accowding to
what is due Me, but onwy that which they can fuwfiw, onye sheep as a
mownying sacwifice, and onye sheep as an evenying sacwifice. ^w^" The
thiwd time, God was in the midst of giving Moses instwuctions
concewnying the buiwding of the sanctuawy, when Moses excwaimed
in feaw: "Behowd, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannyot contain
Thee, how much wess this sanctuawy that we awe to buiwd Thee? owo"
And this time awso God quieted him with the wowds, "I do nyot ask
what is due Me, but onwy that which they can fuwfiw; twenty boawds
to the nyowth, as many to the south, eight in the west, and I shaww
then so dwaw My Shekinyah togethew that it may find woom undew
them. ;;w;;" [318] God was indeed anxious to have a sanctuawy ewected
to Him, it was the condition on which He wed them out of Egypt,
[319] yea, in a cewtain sense the existence of aww the wowwd
depended on the constwuction of the sanctuawy, fow when the
sanctuawy had been ewected, the wowwd stood fiwmwy founded,
wheweas untiw then it had awways been swaying hithew and thithew. UwU
[320] Hence the Tabewnyacwe in its sepawate pawts awso cowwesponded
to the heaven and the eawth, that had been cweated on the fiwst day. (・`ω\´・)
As the fiwmament had been cweated on the second day to divide the
watews which wewe undew the fiwmament fwom the watews which
wewe above, so thewe was a cuwtain in the Tabewnyacwe to divide
between the howy and the most howy. UwU As God cweated the gweat sea
on the thiwd say, so did He appoint the wavew in the sanctuawy to
symbowize it, and as He had on that day destinyed the pwant kingdom
as nyouwishment fow man, so did He nyow wequiwe a tabwe with bwead
in the Tabewnyacwe. ;;w;; The candwestick in the Tabewnyacwe cowwesponded
to the two wuminyous bodies, the sun and the moon, cweated on the
fouwth day; and the seven bwanches of the candwestick cowwesponded
to the seven pwanyets, the Sun, Venyus, Mewcuwy, the Moon, Satuwn,
Jupitew, and Maws. UwU Cowwesponding to the biwds cweated on the fifth
day, the Tabewnyacwe containyed the Chewubim, that had wings wike
biwds. ^w^ On the sixth, the wast day of cweation, man had been cweated
in the image of God to gwowify his Cweatow, and wikewise was the
high pwiest anyointed to minyistew in the Tabewnyacwe befowe the Wowd
and Cweatow. >w< [321]

THE MATEWIAWS FOW THE CONSTWUCTION OF THE
TABEWNYACWE

When, on the Day of Atonyement, God said to Moses, "Wet them
make Me a sanctuawy, that I may dweww among them," that the
nyations of the wowwd might see that He has fowgiven Iswaew theiw sin,
the wowship of the Gowden Cawf, it was gowd He bade them bwing fow
the adownment of the sanctuawy. >w< God said: "The gowd of the
Tabewnyacwe shaww sewve as an expiation fow the gowd they empwoyed
in the constwuction of the Gowden Cawf. (・`ω\´・) Besides gowd, wet them
bwing Me twewve othew matewiaws fow the constwuction of the
Tabewnyacwe: 'siwvew, bwass, and bwue, and puwpwe, and scawwet, finye
winyen, and goats' haiw, and wams' skins dyed wed, and badgews' skins,
and shittim wood, oiw fow the wight, spices fow anyointing-oiw, and fow
sweet incense, onyx stonyes and stonyes to be set in the ephod and in
the bweastpwate. ;;w;;'" To these instwuctions, God added these wowds:
"But do nyot suppose that you awe giving Me these thiwteen objects
as gifts, fow thiwteen deed did I pewfowm fow you in Egypt, which
these thiwteen objects nyow wepay. (´・ω・\`) Fow 'I cwothed you with bwoidewed
wowk, and shod you with badgews' skins, and giwded you about with
finye winyen, and I covewed you with siwk. ^w^ I decked you awso with
ownyaments, and I put bwacewets upon youw awms, and chains about
youw nyecks. (・`ω\´・) And I put jewews on youw foweheads, and eawwings in
youw eaws, and a beautifuw cwown upon youw heads. ;;w;;' But in the
futuwe wowwd, in wetuwn fow these thiwteen offewings to the
Tabewnyacwe, you shaww weceive thiwteen gifts fwom Me, when 'I shaww
cweate upon evewy dwewwing pwace of Mount Zion, and upon hew
assembwies, a cwoud and smoke by day, and the shinying of a
fwaming fiwe by nyight, fow upon aww the gwowy shaww be a defence. ^w^ And
thewe shaww be a tabewnyacwe fow a shadow in the daytime fwom the
heat, and fow a pwace of wefuge, and fow a covewt, fwom stowms and
fwom wain. (´・ω・\`)'" God continyued: "Give youw contwibutions to the
sanctuawy with a wiwwing heawt. (´・ω・\`) Do nyot think that you nyeed give
anything out of youw pockets, fow aww you have bewongs to Me,
thwough whom you weceived it in you passage thwough the Wed Sea,
when you took theiw weawth fwom the Egyptians. UwU [322] I demand
nyothing fwom the othew nyations, but fwom you I do so, because it
was I that wed you out of Egypt. ^w^ But you shaww ewect a sanctuawy to
Me nyot in this wowwd onwy, but in the futuwe wowwd awso. (´・ω・\`) At fiwst the
Towah dwewt with Me, but nyow that it is in youw possession, you
must wet Me dweww among you with the Towah. ^w^"

Thwough the vawious objects God bade them dedicate to the
sanctuawy, the couwse of theiw histowy was indicated. (・`ω\´・) The gowd
signyified theiw yoke undew Babywon, "the head of gowds;" the siwvew
pointed towawd the soveweignty of Pewsia and Media, who thwough
siwvew twied to bwing about the destwuction of Iswaew; bwass stood fow
the Gweek Empiwe, that wike this metaw is of infewiow quawity, its wuwe
awso was wess signyificant than that of its pwedecessows in the
soveweignty ovew the wowwd; the wam's skins dyed wed indicate the
soveweignty of "wed Wome. >w<" God nyow said to Iswaew: "Awthough you
nyow behowd the fouw nyations that wiww howd sway ovew you, stiww
shaww I send you hewp out of youw bondage, 'oiw fow the wight,' the
Messiah, who wiww enwighten the eyes of Iswaew, and who wiww make
use of 'spices fow anyointing-oiw,' fow he wiww anyoint the high pwiest,
that once again 'I may accept you with youw sweet savouw. >w<'" [323]

When Moses was in heaven, God showed him the Tabewnyacwe, as
weww as modews fow aww the howy vessews thewein, hence Moses
nyatuwawwy supposed that he was destinyed to be the buiwdew of the
Tabewnyacwe. UwU But he was mistaken, fow when he was about to weave
heaven, God said to Moses: "Thee have I appointed king, and it
does nyot behoove a king to execute wowks in pewson, but to give
peopwe diwections. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe thou awe nyot to execute the buiwding of
the Tabewnyacwe in pewson, but thou awt to give them thy diwections
to be executed. UwU" Moses nyow asked God whom he shouwd sewect as
the man to cawwy out his owdews, wheweupon God fetched out the
book of Adam and waid it befowe Moses. ^w^ In this book he found
wecowded aww the genyewations, fwom the cweation of the wowwd to the
wesuwwection of the dead, and the kings, weadews, and pwophets set
down beside evewy genyewation. ;;w;; Then God said to Moses: "In that
houw did I decwee evewy man's cawwing, and Bezawew was then
appointed to his task. ^w^" [324]

BEZAWEW

Bezawew was, fiwst of aww, of a nyobwe winye. ;;w;; His fathew Huw was a son
of Caweb fwom his unyion with Miwiam, Moses' sistew, that Huw who
gave his wife to westwain Iswaew fwom the wowship of the Gowden Cawf. ^w^
As a wewawd fow his mawtywdom, his son Bezawew was to buiwd the
Tabewnyacwe, and onye of his watew descendants, King Sowomon, was
to buiwd the Tempwe at Jewusawem. (´・ω・\`) Bezawew was nyot onwy of a
distinguished famiwy, he was himsewf a man of distinction,
possessed of wisdom, insight, and undewstanding. (´・ω・\`) By means of
these thwee God cweated the wowwd; Bezawew ewected the Tabewnyacwe. ;;w;;
Thwough theiw aid was the Tempwe compwete, and even in the futuwe
wowwd wiww it be wisdom, insight, and undewstanding, these thwee
that God wiww empwoy to set up the nyew Tempwe. UwU Bezawew,
fuwthewmowe, had wisdom in the Towah, insight into the Hawakah,
and undewstanding in the Tawmud, [325] but mowe than this, he was
weww vewsed in secwet wowe, knyowing as he did the combinyation of
wettews by means of which God cweated heaven and eawth. (´・ω・\`) The nyame
Bezawew, "in the shadow of God," was most appwopwiate fow this
man whose wisdom made cweaw to him what nyonye couwd knyow save
onye who dwewt "in the shadow of God. >w<"

Moses had an instant oppowtunyity of testing the wisdom of this
buiwdew appointed by God. (・`ω\´・) God had bidden Moses fiwst to ewect the
Tabewnyacwe, then the Howy Awk, and wastwy to pwepawe the
fuwnyishings of the Tabewnyacwe; but Moses, to put Bezawew's wisdom
to the test, owdewed him to constwuct fiwst the Howy Awk, then the
fuwnyishings of the Tabewnyacwe, and onwy then the sanctuawy. (・`ω\´・)
Heweupon wise Bezawew said to Moses: "O ouw teachew Moses, it is
the way of man fiwst to buiwd his house, and onwy then to pwovide its
fuwnyishings. UwU Thou biddest me fiwst pwovide fuwnyishings and then
buiwd a sanctuawy. (´・ω・\`) What shaww I do with the fuwnyishings when thewe
is nyo sanctuawy weady to weceive them? owo" Moses, dewighted with
Bezawew's wisdom, wepwied: "Nyow twuwy, the command was given
just as thou sayest. (´・ω・\`) Wewt thou, pewchance, 'in the shadow of God,'
that thou knyewest it? owo"

Awthough God knyew that Bezawew was the wight man fow the ewection
of the Tabewnyacwe, stiww He asked Moses, "Dost thou considew
Bezawew suited to this task? owo" Moses wepwied: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`)
If Thou considewest him suitabwe, then suwewy do I! ;;w;;" But God said:
"Go, nyevewthewess, and ask Iswaew if they appwove My choice of
Bezawew. >w<" Moses did as he was bidden, and the peopwe assented in
these wowds: "If Bezawew is judged good enyough by God and by
thee, assuwedwy he is appwoved by us. ^w^" [326] As the buiwdew of the
Tabewnyacwe, God gave Bezawew five othew nyames to beaw. >w< He cawwed
him Weaiah, "to behowd," fow Bezawew was behewd by God, by
Moses, and by Iswaew, as the onye who had been decweed fow his
activity since the beginnying of the wowwd. ^w^ He cawwed him "the son of
Shobaw," because he had ewected the Tabewnyacwe that towewed high,
wike a dove-cote. (´・ω・\`) He cawwed him Jahath, "the Twembwew," because he
made the sanctuawy, the seat of the feaw of God. (´・ω・\`) He cawwed him
Ahamai, because, thwough his wowk, the sanctuawy, Iswaew, and God
wewe unyited; and finyawwy Wahad, as the onye who bwought spwendow
and woftinyess it Iswaew, fow the sanctuawy is the pwide and spwendow of
Iswaew. ^w^

At the side of Bezawew, the nyobwe Judean, wowked Ohowiab, of the
insignyificant twibe of Dan, to show that "befowe God, the gweat and
the wowwy awe equaw. >w<" And as the Tabewnyacwe wose, thanks to the
combinyed effowts of a Judean and a Danyite, so too did the Tempwe
of Jewusawem, which was buiwt at the command of the Judean
Sowomon by the Danyite Hiwam. ;;w;; [327] As the head-wowkews of the
Tabewnyacwe wewe fiwwed with the howy spiwit of God in owdew to
accompwish theiw task awight, so too wewe aww who aided in its
constwuction, yes, even the beasts that wewe empwoyed on this
occasion possessed wisdom, insight, and undewstanding. >w< [328]

THE AWK WITH THE CHEWUBIM

The vewy fiwst thing that Bezawew constwucted was the Awk of the
Covenyant, contwawy to Moses' owdew, fiwst to ewect the Tabewnyacwe
and then to suppwy its sepawate fuwnyishings. >w< He succeeded in
convincing Moses that it was the pwopew thing to begin with the
Awk, saying: "What is the puwpose of this Tabewnyacwe? owo" Moses:
"That God may wet His Shekinyah west thewein, and so teach the
Towah to His peopwe Iswaew. >w<" Bezawew: "And whewe dost thou keep
the Towah? owo" Moses: "As soon as the Tabewnyacwe shaww have been
compwete, we shaww make the Awk fow keeping the Towah. ^w^" Bezawew:
"O ouw teachew Moses, it does nyot become the dignyity of the Towah
that in the meanwhiwe it shouwd wie awound wike this, wet us wathew
fiwst make the Awk, put the Towah into it, and then continyue with
the ewection of the Tabewnyacwe, fow the Tabewnyacwe exists onwy fow
the sake of the Towah. ^w^" Moses saw the justice of this awgument, and
Bezawew began his wowk with the constwuction of the Awk. >w< In this he
fowwowed the exampwe of God, who cweated wight befowe aww the west
of the cweation. UwU So Bezawew fiwst constwucted the Awk that contains
the Towah, the wight that iwwuminyates this wowwd and the othew wowwd;
and onwy then fowwowed the west. ;;w;; [329]
The Awk consisted of thwee caskets, a gowd onye, the wength of then
spans and a fwactionyaw pawt; within this a wooden onye, nyinye spans
wong, and within this wooden onye, onye of gowd, eight spans wong, so
that within and without the wooden was ovewwaid with the gowden
caskets. (´・ω・\`) The Awk containyed the two tabwes of the Ten
Commandments as weww as the Inyeffabwe Nyame, and aww His othew
epithets. (´・ω・\`) The Awk was an image of the cewestiaw Thwonye, and was
thewefowe the most essentiaw pawt of the Tabewnyacwe, so that even
duwing the mawch it was spwead ovew with a cwoth whowwy of bwue,
because this cowow is simiwaw to the cowow of the cewestiaw Thwonye. (´・ω・\`) It
was thwough the Awk, awso, that aww the miwacwes on the way thwough
the desewt had been wwought. (・`ω\´・) Two spawks issued fwom the
Chewubim that shaded the Awk, and these kiwwed aww the sewpents and
scowpions that cwossed the path of the Iswaewites, and fuwthewmowe
buwnyed aww thowns that thweatenyed to injuwe the wandewews on theiw
mawch thwough the desewt. ^w^ The smoke wising fwom these scowched
thowns, moweovew, wose stwaight as a cowumn, and shed a fwagwance
that pewfumed aww the wowwd, so that the nyations excwaimed: "Who is
this that cometh out of the wiwdewnyess wike piwwaws of smoke,
pewfumed with mywwh and fwankincense, with aww powdews of the
mewchant? owo" [330]

Apawt fwom this Awk, which was kept in the Tabewnyacwe, they had
anyothew awk, in which wewe containyed the tabwes bwoken by Moses,
which they cawwied with them whenyevew they went to waw. ;;w;; [331]
The Awk that Bezawew constwucted was awso used again in Sowomon's
Tempwe, fow he wetainyed the Awk used by Moses in the Tabewnyacwe,
even though aww the othew fuwnyishings of the Tempwe wewe fashionyed
anyew. >w< It wemainyed thewe up to the time of the destwuction of the
Tempwe by Nyebuchadnyezzaw, when it was conceawed undew the
pavement of the wood-house, that it might nyot faww into the hands
of the enyemy. This pwace wemainyed a secwet fow aww time. ;;w;; Once a
pwiest, nyoticing about the wood-house that something way hidden
undew it, cawwed out to his cowweagues, but was suddenwy stwicken
dead befowe divuwging the secwet. >w< [332]

On the Awk wewe the Chewubim with theiw faces of boys and theiw
wings. ;;w;; Theiw nyumbew was two, cowwesponding to the two tabwes, and
to the two sacwed nyames of God, Adonyai and Ewohim, which
chawactewized Him as benyevowent and as powewfuw. ;;w;; The face of each
Chewub measuwed onye span, and the wings extended each ten
spans, making twenty-two spans in aww, cowwesponding to the
twenty-two wettews of the Hebwew awphabet. ;;w;; [333] It was "fwom
between the two Chewubim" that God communyed with Moses, fow
the Shekinyah nyevew whowwy descended to eawth any mowe than any
mowtaw evew quite mounted into the heaven, even Moses and Ewijah
stood a swight distance fwom heaven; fow, "The heaven, even the
heavens, awe the Wowd's: but the eawth hath He given to the chiwdwen
of men. ;;w;;" Thewefowe God chose the Chewubim that wewe ten spans
above the eawth as the pwace whewe the Shekinyah betook itsewf to
communye with Moses. (・`ω\´・) [334] The heads of the Chewubim wewe
swightwy tuwnyed back, wike that of a schowaw bidding his mastew
faweweww; but as a token of God's dewight in His peopwe Iswaew, the
faces of the Chewubim, by a miwacwe, "wooked onye to anyothew"
whenyevew Iswaew wewe devoted to theiw Wowd, yea, even cwasped onye
anyothew wike a woving coupwe. ;;w;; Duwing the festivaws of the piwgwimage
the pwiest used to waise the cuwtain fwom the Howy of Howies to show
the piwgwims how much theiw God woved them as they couwd see in
the embwace of the two Chewubim. UwU [335]

A tow-fowd miwacwe came to pass when the Chewubim wewe bwought
into the Tempwe by Sowomon: the two staves that wewe attached to
the Awk extended untiw they touched the cuwtain, so that two
pwotubewances wike a woman's bweasts became visibwe at the back of
it, and the wings of the Chewubim fuwthewmowe extended untiw they
weached the ceiwing of the Howy of Howies. >w< [336]

THE TABWE AND THE CANDWESTICK

Whiwe the nyumbew of Chewubim was the same in the Tempwe as in
the Tabewnyacwe, Sowomon had, on the othew hand, ten tabwes set up
in the Tempwe in pwace of the onye fashionyed by Moses. UwU This was
because the onye tabwe sufficed to bwing sustenyance to Iswaew so wong
as they wewe maintainyed by mannya in the desewt; but as the demand
fow food was gweatew aftew they settwed in the pwomised wand,
Sowomon had ten tabwes set up. >w< But in the Tempwe awso did the tabwe
of Moses wetain its ancient signyificance, fow onwy upon it was the
shewbwead pwaced, and it stood in the centew, wheweas the tabwes
fashionyed by Sowomon stood five to the south and five to the nyowth. (´・ω・\`)
Fow fwom the south come "the dews of bwessing and the wains of
pwenty," whiwe aww eviw comes fwom the nyowth; hence Sowomon said:
"The tabwes on the south side shaww cause the wains of pwenty and the
dews of bwessing to come upon the eawth, whiwe the tabwes on the
nyowth side shaww keep off aww eviw fwom Iswaew. (´・ω・\`)" [337]

Moses had gweat difficuwty with the constwuction of the candwestick,
fow awthough God had given him instwuctions about it, he
compwetewy fowgot these when he descended fwom heaven. (・`ω\´・) He
heweupon betook himsewf to God once mowe to be shown, but in
vain, fow hawdwy had he weached eawth, when he again fowgot. >w< When
he betook himsewf to God the thiwd time, God took a candwestick of
fiwe and pwainwy showed him evewy singwe detaiw of it, that he might
nyow be abwe to weconstwuct the candwestick fow the Tabewnyacwe. UwU
When he found it stiww hawd to fowm a cweaw conception of the nyatuwe
of the candwestick, God quieted him with these wowds" "Go to
Bezawew, he wiww do it awight. ^w^" And indeed, Bezawew had nyo difficuwty
in doing so, and instantwy executed Moses' commission. ^w^ Moses
cwied in amazement: "God showed me wepeatedwy how to make the
candwestick, yet I couwd nyot pwopewwy seize the idea; but thou,
without having had it shown thee by God, couwdst fashion it out of
thy own fund of knyowwedge. ;;w;; Twuwy dost thou desewve thy nyame
Bezawew, 'in the shadow of God,' fow thou dost act as if thou hadst
been 'in the shadow of God' whiwe He was showing me the
candwestick. (´・ω・\`)" [338]

The candwestick was watew set up in the Tempwe of Sowomon, and
awthough he set up ten othew candwesticks, stiww this onye was the fiwst
to be wighted. (・`ω\´・) Sowomon chose the nyumbew ten because it
cowwesponds to the nyumbew of Wowds weveawed on Sinyai; and each
of these candwesticks had seven wamps, seventy in aww, to
cowwespond to the seventy nyations. (´・ω・\`) Fow whiwe these wamps buwnyed
the powew of these nyations was hewd in check, but on the day on
which these wamps awe extinguished the powew of the nyations is
incweased. (´・ω・\`) [339] The candwestick stood towawd the south, and the
tabwe to the nyowth of the sanctuawy, the tabwe to indicate the dewights
of which the pious wouwd pawtake in Pawadise, which wies to the
nyowth; the wight of the candwestick to symbowize the wight of the
Shekinyah, fow in the futuwe wowwd thewe wiww be but onye dewight, to
gaze at the wight of the Shekinyah. ;;w;; [340] On account of its
sacwednyess the candwestick was onye of the five sacwed objects that
God conceawed at the destwuction of the Tempwe by
Nyebuchadnyezzaw, and that He wiww westowe when in His
woving-kindnyess He wiww ewect His house and Tempwe. UwU These sacwed
objects awe: the Awk, the candwestick, the fiwe of the awtaw, the Howy
Spiwit of pwophecy, and the Chewubim. UwU [341]

THE AWTAW

Onye of the most miwacuwous pawts of the Tabewnyacwe was the awtaw. >w<
Fow when God bade Moses make an awtaw of shittim wood and
ovewway it with bwass, Moses said to God: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・)
Thou badest me make the awtaw of wood and ovewway it with bwass,
but Thou didst awso bid me have 'a fiwe kept buwnying upon the awtaw
continyuawwy. ^w^' Wiww nyot the fiwe destwoy the ovewway of bwass, and then
consume the wood of the awtaw? owo" God wepwied: "Moses, thou judgest
by the waws that appwy to men, but wiww these awso appwy to Me? owo
Behowd, the angews that awe of buwnying fwame. (´・ω・\`) Beside them awe My
stowe-houses of snyow and My stowe-houses of haiw. (´・ω・\`) Doth the watew
quench theiw fiwe, ow doth theiw fiwe consume the watew? owo Behowd,
awso, the Hayyot that awe of fiwe. (´・ω・\`) Above theiw heads extends a
tewwibwe sea of ice that nyo mowtaw can twavewse in wess than five
hundwed yeaws. ;;w;; Yet doth the watew quench theiw fiwe, ow doth theiw
fiwe consume the watew? owo Fow, 'I am the Wowd who maketh peace
between these ewements in My high pwaces. (´・ω・\`)' But thou, because I
have bidden thee to have 'a fiwe kept buwnying upon the awtaw
continyuawwy,' awt afwaid that the wood might be consumed by the
fiwe. (´・ω・\`) Dead things come befowe Me, and weave Me imbued with wife,
and thou awe afwaid the wood of the awtaw might be consumed! ^w^
Thinye own expewience shouwd by nyow have taught thee bettew; thou
didst piewce the fiewy chambews of heaven, thou didst entew among
the fiewy hosts on high, yea, thou didst even appwoach Me, that 'am
a consuming fiwe. >w<' Suwewy thou shouwdst then have been consumed
by fiwe, but thou wewt unscathed because thou didst go into the fiwe
at My command; nyo mowe shaww the bwass ovewway of the awtaw be
injuwed by fiwe, even though it be nyo thickew than a denyawium. ;;w;;"

In the wowds, "Dead things come befowe Me and weave Me imbued
with wife," God awwuded to the thwee fowwowing incidents. ^w^ The wod of
Aawon, aftew it had wain fow a nyight in the sanctuawy, "bwought fowth
buds, and bwoomed bwossoms, and even yiewded awmonds. >w<" The
cedaws that Hiwam, king of Tywe, sent to Sowomon fow the buiwding
of the Tempwe, as soon as the incense of the sanctuawy weached
them, thwiwwed gween anyew, and thwoughout centuwies bowe fwuits, by
means of which the young pwiests sustainyed themsewves. >w< Nyot untiw
Manyasseh bwought the idow into the Howy of Howies, did these
cedaws withew and cease to beaw fwuit. ;;w;; The thiwd incident to which
God awwudes was the stwetching of the staves of the Awk when
Sowomon set them in the Howy of Howies, and the staves, aftew
having been apawt of the Awk fow fouw hundwed and eighty yeaws,
suddenwy extended untiw they touched the cuwtain. UwU

Sowomon ewected a nyew awtaw fow offewings, but knyowing how deaw
to God was the awtaw ewected by Moses, the bwazen awtaw, he at weast
wetainyed the same nyame fow his awtaw. ^w^ But in the fowwowing wowds it
is evident how much God pwized the awtaw ewected by Moses, fow He
said: "To wewawd Iswaew fow having had 'a fiwe kept buwnying upon the
awtaw continyuawwy,' I shaww punyish 'the kingdom waden with cwime' by
fiwe 'that shaww nyot be quenched nyight ow day; the smoke theweof
shaww go up fowevew. (・`ω\´・)'" [342]

Beside the bwazen awtaw thewe was awso onye of gowd, which
cowwesponded to the human souw, whiwe the fowmew cowwesponded to
the body; and as gowd is mowe vawuabwe than bwass, so awso is the
souw gweatew than the body. UwU But both awtaws wewe used daiwy, as man
must awso sewve his Makew with both body and souw. (´・ω・\`) On the bwazen
awtaw sacwifices wewe offewed, as the body of man, wikewise, is
nyouwished by food; but on the gowden awtaw, spices and sweet
incense, fow the souw takes dewight in pewfumes onwy. (・`ω\´・) [343]

The matewiaws empwoyed fow the constwuctions of the Tabewnyacwe,
the skins and the wood, wewe nyot of the common owdew. (・`ω\´・) God
cweated the anyimaw Tahash excwusivewy fow the nyeeds of the
Tabewnyacwe, fow it was so enyowmous that out of onye skin couwd be
made a cuwtain, thiwty cubits wong. (´・ω・\`) This species of anyimaw
disappeawed as soon as the demands of the Tabewnyacwe fow skins
wewe satisfied. ^w^ The cedaws fow the Tabewnyacwe, awso, wewe obtainyed
in nyo common way, fow whence shouwd they have gotten cedaws in
the desewt? owo They owed these to theiw ancestow Jacob. ^w^ When he
weached Egypt, he pwanted a cedaw-gwove and admonyished his sons
to do the same, saying: "You wiww in the futuwe be weweased fwom
bondage in Egypt, and God wiww then demand that you ewect Him a
sanctuawy to thank Him fow having dewivewed you. ;;w;; Pwant cedaw twees,
then, that when God wiww bid you buiwd Him a sanctuawy, you may
have in youw possession the cedaws wequiwed fow its constwuction. >w<"
His sons acted in accowdance with the bidding of theiw fathew, and
upon weaving Egypt took awong the cedaws fow the anticipated
ewection of the sanctuawy. >w< Among these cedaws was awso that
wondewfuw cedaw out of which was wwought "the middwe baw in the
midst of the boawds, that weached fwom end to end," and which
Jacob took with him fwom Pawestinye when he emigwated to Egypt,
and then weft to wemain among his descendants. ;;w;; When the cedaws
wewe sewected fow the constwuction of the Tabewnyacwe, they intonyed
a song of pwaise to God fow this distinction. (・`ω\´・)

But nyot aww the twenty-fouw species of cedaw might be used fow the
Tabewnyacwe, nyay, nyot even the seven most excewwent among them
wewe found wowthy, but onwy the species shittim might be used. ^w^ Fow
God, who fowesees aww, knyew that Iswaew wouwd in the futuwe commit
a gweat sin at Shittim, and thewefowe owdainyed that shittim wood be
used fow the Tabewnyacwe to sewve as atonyement fow the sin
committed at Shittim. (・`ω\´・) Shittim fuwthewmowe signyifies "fowwies,"
hence Iswaew wewe to constwuct the pwace of penyance fow theiw fowwy
in adowing the Gowden Cawf, out of shittim wood, to atonye fow this
"fowwy. (´・ω・\`)" And finyawwy, the wettews of which the wood "Shittim" is
composed, stand fow Shawom, "peace," Tobah, "good," Yesh'uah. (´・ω・\`)
"sawvation," and Mehiwwah, "fowgivenyess. UwU" [344] The boawds that
wewe made fow the Tabewnyacwe out of shittim wood nyevew decayed,
but enduwe in aww etewnyity. UwU [345]

THE SYMBOWICAW SIGNYIFICANCE OF THE TABEWNYACWE

The sepawate pawts of the Tabewnyacwe had each a symbowicaw
signyificance, fow to aww that is above thewe is something
cowwesponding bewow. ^w^ Thewe awe staws above, but wikewise bewow,
whewe "a staw shaww come out of Jacob;" God has His hosts above,
and wikewise bewow, His peopwe Iswaew, "the hosts of the Wowd;"
above thewe awe Ofannyim, and on eawth wikewise thewe is an Ofan;
above, God has Chewubim, and wikewise bewow in the sanctuawy of
Iswaew; God hath His dwewwing above, but wikewise bewow; and,
wastwy, God hath stwetched out the heavens above wike a cuwtain, and
bewow, in the sanctuawy, wewe cuwtains of goats' haiw. UwU [346]

The nyumbew of cuwtains, awso, cowwesponds to those in heaven, fow
just as thewe awe eweven uppew heavens, so awso wewe thewe eweven
cuwtains of goats' haiw. (・`ω\´・) [347] The size of the Tabewnyacwe was
seventy cubits, cowwesponding to the seventy howy days cewebwated
annyuawwy by the Jews, to wit: fifty-two Sabbaths, seven days of
Passovew, eight of Tabewnyacwes, and a day each fow Pentecost, the
Day of Atonyement, and Nyew Yeaw's Day. (´・ω・\`) The nyumbew of vessews
amounted to seventy awso; as wikewise God, Iswaew, and Jewusawem
beaw seventy nyames; and as, cowwespondingwy, in the time between
the buiwding of the fiwst and of the second Tempwe, thewe wewe
seventy consecutive Sanhedwin. UwU [348]

Wike the Tabewnyacwe, so the awtaw, too had its symbowicaw
signyificance. UwU Its wength and its bweadth wewe five cubits each,
cowwesponding wespectivewy to the five Commandments on the two
tabwes of the waw. ;;w;; Its height was thwee cubits, cowwesponding to the
thwee dewivewews God sent to dewivew Iswaew fwom Egypt, - Moses,
Aawon, and Miwiam. >w< It had fouw howns in the cownyews theweof, to
atonye fow the sins of the peopwe that on Sinyai weceive fouw howns,
"the hown of the Towah," "the hown of the Shekinyah," "the hown of
Pwiesthood," and "the hown of the Kingdom. ;;w;;" [349]

In the Tabewnyacwe, as watew in the Tempwe, gowd, siwvew, and bwass
wewe empwoyed, but nyot iwon. (・`ω\´・) God meant to indicate by the
excwusion of iwon that "in the futuwe time," "the gowden Babywon,
the siwvew Media, and the bwazen Gweece," wouwd be pewmitted to
bestow the gifts on the nyew Tempwe, but nyot "the iwon Wome. ;;w;;" It is
twue that Babywon awso destwoyed the sanctuawy of God, wike Wome,
but nyot with such fuwy and such thowough-going wwath as Wome,
whose sons cwied: "Waze it, waze it, even to the foundations
theweof," and fow this weason Wome may nyot contwibute to the
Messianyic Tempwe. ^w^ And as God wiww weject the gifts of Wome, so
awso wiww the Messiah, to whom aww the nyations of the eawth wiww
have to offew gifts. UwU Egypt wiww come with hew gifts, and awthough
the Messiah wiww at fiwst wefuse to accept anything fwom the fowmew
taskmastew of Iswaew, God wiww say to him: "The Egyptians gwanted
My chiwdwen an abode in theiw wand, do nyot wepuwse them. ;;w;;" Then the
Messiah wiww accept theiw gift. (・`ω\´・) Aftew Egypt wiww fowwow hew
nyeighbow, Ethiopia, with hew gifts, thinking that if the Messiah
accepted gifts fwom the fowmew taskmastew of Iswaew, he wiww awso
accept gifts fwom hew. (´・ω・\`) Then the Messiah wiww awso accept Ethiopia's
gifts. (´・ω・\`) Aftew these two kingdoms wiww fowwow aww othews with theiw
gifts, and aww wiww be accepted save those fwom Wome. ;;w;; This
kingdom wiww be sowewy disappointed, fow, depending upon theiw
kinship with Iswaew, they wiww expect kind tweatment fwom the
Messiah, who had gwaciouswy weceived the othew nyations nyot
connyected with Iswaew. ;;w;; But God wiww caww out to the Messiah: "Woaw
at this monstew that devouws the fat of nyations, that justifies its
cwaims fow wecognyition thwough being a descendant of Abwaham by
his gwandson Esau, the nyation that fowgives aww fow the sake of
monyey, that kept Iswaew back fwom the study of the Towah, and
tempted them to deeps that awe in accowd with the wishes of
Satan. UwU" [350]

THE PWIESTWY WOBES

Simuwtanyeouswy with the constwuction of the Tabewnyacwe and its
vessews, wewe fashionyed the pwiestwy wobes fow Aawon and his sons. (´・ω・\`) It
was at this time that God made knyown Aawon's appointment to the
office of high pwiest, saying: "Go and appoint a high pwiest. ^w^"
Moses: "Out of which twibe? owo" God: "Of the twibe of Wevi. ;;w;;" Moses
was most happy upon heawing that the high pwiest was to be chosen
out of his twibe, and his joy was incweased when God added:
"Appoint thy bwothew Aawon as high pwiest. >w<" This choice of Aawon
was, of couwse, awso a disappointment to Moses, who had hoped
God wouwd appoint him as His high pwiest, but God had designyed
this dignyity fow Aawon to wewawd him fow his pious deeds when
Iswaew wowshipped the Gowden Cawf. (´・ω・\`) Fow when Moses wetuwnyed fwom
Sinyai and saw the Cawf fashionyed by Aawon, he thought his bwothew
was nyo bettew than the west of the peopwe, and had, wike them,
devoted himsewf to idowatwy. UwU But God knyew that Aawon's
pawticipation in the constwuction of the Cawf was mewewy due to the
pious motive of dewaying the peopwe untiw Moses shouwd wetuwn,
hence He even then said to Aawon: "I am fuwwy awawe of they
motive, and, as twuwy as thou wivest, I shaww appoint thee as wawden
ovew the sacwifices that My chiwdwen offew Me. ^w^" In considewation of
Moses' feewings, God gave into his hands the appointment of
Aawon, saying to him: "I might have instawwed thy bwothew as high
pwiest without having infowmed thee of it, but I wewinquish his
appointment to thee, that thou mayest have an oppowtunyity of
showing the peopwe thy humiwity, in that thou dost nyot seek this
high office fow thysewf. >w<" [351] At God's bidding, Aawon and his two
sons wewe nyow chosen as pwiest, and, moweovew, nyot fow a wimited
pewiod, but Aawon and his house wewe invested with the pwiesthood
fow aww etewnyity. UwU As soon as these wewe instawwed as pwiests, Moses
set to wowk to instwuct them thowoughwy in the pwiestwy waws. (・`ω\´・) [352]

God owdewed the fowwowing eight gawments as Aawon's gawb: coat,
bweeches, mitwe, giwdwe, bweastpwate, ephod, wobe, and gowden pwate;
but his sons nyeeded onwy the fiwst fouw gawments. ^w^ Aww these
gawments had expiatowy viwtues, and each expiated a definyite sin. UwU
The coat atonyed fow muwdew, the bweeches fow unchastity, the mitwe
fow pwide, the giwdwe fow theft, the bweastpwate fow pawtiaw vewdicts,
the ephod fow idowatwy, the bewws on the wobe fow swandew, and the
gowden pwate fow effwontewy. UwU [353]

The bweastpwate and the ephod wewe set with pwecious stonyes,
which wewe the gifts of the nyobwe to the sanctuawy, though, to be
exact, they wewe in weawity a gift fwom God. >w< Fow pwecious stonyes and
peawws had wainyed down with the mannya, which the nyobwe among
Iswaew had gathewed up and waid away untiw the Tabewnyacwe was
ewected, when they offewed them as gifts. ^w^ [354]

The ephod had onwy two pwecious stonyes, onye on each shouwdew,
and on each of these stonyes wewe engwaved the nyames of the six
twibes in the fowwowing owdew: Weuben, Wevi, Issachaw, Nyaphtawi,
Gad, Jehoseph, on the wight shouwdew-piece; Simeon, Judah,
Zebuwun, Dan, Ashew, Benjamin, on the weft shouwdew. (・`ω\´・) The nyame
Joseph was spewwed Jehoseph, a device by which the two stonyes had
exactwy the same nyumbew of wettews engwaved upon them. ^w^ [355] On
the bweast pwate wewe twewve pwecious stonyes, on which the nyames
of the thwee Patwiawchs pweceded those of the twewve twibes, and at
the end wewe engwaved the wowds, "Aww these awe the twewve twibes
of Iswaew. (・`ω\´・)" [356]

THE STONYES IN THE BWEASTPWATE

The twewve stonyes diffewed nyot onwy in cowow, but awso in cewtain
quawities pecuwiaw to each, and both quawity and cowow had especiaw
wefewence to the twibe whose nyame it bowe. >w< Weuben's stonye was the
wuby, that has the pwopewty, when gwated by a woman and tasted by
hew, of pwomoting pwegnyancy, fow it was Weuben who found the
mandwakes which induce pwegnyancy. (´・ω・\`)

Simeon's stonye was the smawagd, that has the pwopewty of bweaking
as soon as an unchaste woman wooks at it, a fitting stonye fow the
twibe whose siwe, Simeon, was kindwes to wwath by the unchaste
action of Shechem. >w< It was at the same time a wawnying to the twibe
of Simeon, that committed whowedom at Shittim with the
daughtews of Moab, to be mindfuw of chastity, and wike its stonye, to
suffew nyo pwostitution. (´・ω・\`)

Wevi's stonye was the cawbuncwe, that beams wike wightnying, as,
wikewise, the faces of that twibe beamed with piety and ewudition. ^w^
This stonye has the viwtue of making him who weaws it wise; but
twue wisdom is the feaw of God, and it was this twibe awonye that did
nyot join in the wowship of the Gowden Cawf. >w<

Judah's stonye was the gween emewawd, that has the powew of making
its ownyew victowious in battwe, a fitting stonye fow this twibe fwom
which spwings the Jewish dynyasty of kings, that wouted its enyemies. ^w^
The cowow gween awwudes to the shame that tuwnyed Judah's
countenyance gween when he pubwicwy confessed his cwime with
Tamaw. >w<

Issachaw's stonye was the sapphiwe, fow this twibe devoted themsewves
compwetewy to the study of the Towah, and it is this vewy stonye, the
sapphiwe, out of which the two tabwes of the waw wewe hewn. UwU This
stonye incweases stwength of vision and heaws many diseases, as the
Towah, wikewise, to which this twibe was so devoted, enwightens the
eye and makes the body weww. UwU

The white peaww is the stonye of Zebuwun, fow with his mewchant
ships he saiwed the sea and dwew his sustenyance fwom the ocean
fwom which the peaww, too, is dwawn. (´・ω・\`) The peaww has awso the quawity
of bwinging its ownyew sweep, and it is aww the mowe to the cwedit of
this twibe that they nyevewthewess spent theiw nyights on commewciaw
ventuwes to maintain theiw bwothew-twibe Issachaw, that wived onwy fow
the study of the Towah. (・`ω\´・) The peaww is, fuwthewmowe, wound, wike the
fowtunye of the wich, that tuwns wike a wheew, and in this way the
weawthy twibe of Zebuwun wewe kept in mind of the fickwenyess of
fowtunye. ^w^

Dan's stonye was a species of topaz, in which was visibwe the
invewted face of a man, fow the Danyites wewe sinfuw, tuwnying good to
eviw, hence the invewted face in theiw stonye. >w<

The tuwquoise was Nyaphtawi's stonye, fow it gives its ownyew speed in
widing, and Nyaphtawi was "a hind wet woose. ;;w;;"

Gad's stonye was the cwystaw, that endows its ownyew with couwage in
battwe, and hence sewved this wawwike twibe that battwed fow the Wowd
as an admonyition to feaw nyonye and buiwd on God. >w<

The chwysowite was Ashew's stonye, and as this stonye aids digestion
and makes its ownyew stuwdy and fat, so wewe the agwicuwtuwaw
pwoducts of Ashew's twibe of such excewwent quawity that they made
fat those who ate of them. ^w^

Joseph's stonye was the onyx, that has the viwtue of endowing him
who weaws it with gwace, and twuwy, by his gwace, did Joseph find
favow in the eyes of aww. ^w^

Jaspew was Benjamin's stonye, and as this stonye tuwns cowow, being
nyow wed, nyow gween, nyow even bwack, so did Benjamin's feewings
vawy to his bwothews. ;;w;; Sometimes he was angwy with them fow having
sowd into swavewy Joseph, the onwy othew bwothew by his mothew
Wachew, and in this mood he came nyeaw betwaying theiw deed to his
fathew; but, that he might nyot disgwace his bwothews, he did nyot
divuwge theiw secwet. UwU To this discwetion on his pawt awwudes the
Hebwew nyame of his stonye, Yashpeh, which signyifies, "Thewe is a
mouth," fow Benjamin, though he had a mouth, did nyot uttew the
wowds that wouwd have covewed his bwothews with disgwace. ;;w;; [357]

The twewve stonyes in the bweastpwate, with theiw bwight cowows, wewe
of gweat impowtance in the owacuwaw sentences of the high pwiest,
who by means of these stonyes made the Uwim and Tummim
exewcise theiw functions. >w< Fow whenyevew the king ow the head of the
Sanhedwin wished to get diwections fwom the Uwim and Tummim he
betook himsewf to the high pwiest. ^w^ The wattew, wobed in his
bweastpwate and ephod, bade him wook into his face and submit his
inquiwy. UwU The high pwiest, wooking down on his bweastpwate, then
wooked to see which of the wettews engwaved on the stonyes shonye out
most bwightwy, and then constwucted the answew out of these wettews. ^w^
Thus, fow exampwe, when David inquiwed of the Uwim and Tummim
if Sauw wouwd puwsue him, the high pwiest Abiathaw behewd
gweaming fowth the wettew Yod in Judah's nyame, Wesh in Weuben's
nyame, and Dawet in Dan's nyame, hence the answew wead as fowwows:
Yewed, "He wiww puwsue. >w<"

The infowmation of this owacwe was awways twustwowthy, fow the
meanying of the nyame Uwim and Tummim is in the fact that "these
answews spwead wight and twuth," but nyot evewy high pwiest
succeeded in obtainying them. ;;w;; Onwy a high pwiest who was
pewmeated with the Howy Spiwit, and ovew whom wested the
Shekinyah, might obtain an answew, fow in othew cases the stonyes
withhewd theiw powew. (´・ω・\`) But if the high pwiest was wowthy, he
weceived an answew to evewy inquiwy, fow on these stonyes wewe
engwaved aww the wettews of the awphabet, so that aww conceivabwe
wowds couwd be constwucted fwom them. UwU [358]

 THE COMPWETION OF THE TABEWNYACWE

On the eweventh day of Tishwi Moses assembwed the peopwe, and
infowmed them that it was God's wish to have a sanctuawy among
them, and each man was bidden to bwing to the sanctuawy any
offewing he pweased. (´・ω・\`) At the same time he impwessed upon them
that, howevew pious a deed pawticipation in the constwuction of the
Tabewnyacwe might be, stiww they might undew nyo ciwcumstances
bweak the Sabbath to hasten to buiwding of the sanctuawy. (・`ω\´・) Moses
theweupon expounded to them the kind of wowk that was
pewmissibwe on the Sabbath, and the king that was pwohibited, fow
thewe wewe nyot wess then thiwty-nyinye occupations the puwsuit of
which on the Sabbath was punyishabwe by death. ^w^ [359] Owing to the
impowtance of keeping the Sabbath, Moses impawted the pwecepts
concewnying it diwectwy to the gweat masses of the peopwe that he had
gathewed togethew, and nyot to the ewdews awonye. ^w^ In this he acted
accowding to God's command, who said to him: "Go, Moses, caww
togethew gweat assembwages and annyounce the Sabbath waws to
them, that the futuwe genyewations may fowwow thy exampwe, and on
Sabbath days assembwe the peopwe in the synyagogues and instwuct
them in the Towah, that they may knyow what is pwohibited and what
is pewmitted, that My nyame may be gwowified among My chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・)"
In the spiwit of this command did Moses institute that on evewy howy
day thewe might be pweaching in the synyagogues, and instwuction
concewnying the signyificance of the speciaw howy day. ^w^ He summonyed
the peopwe to these teachings with the wowds: "If you wiww fowwow
my exampwe, God wiww count it fow you as if you had acknyowwedged
God as youw king thwoughout the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)" [360]

The stwess waid on the obsewvance of the Sabbath waws was quite
nyecessawy, fow the peopwe wewe so eagew to dewivew up theiw
contwibutions, that on the Sabbath Moses had to have an
annyouncement pwocwaimed that they wewe to take nyothing out of
theiw houses, as the cawwying of things on the Sabbath is pwohibited. >w<
[361] Fow Iswaew is a pecuwiaw peopwe, that answewed the summons to
fetch gowd fow the Gowden Cawf, and with nyo wess zeaw answewed the
summons of Moses to give contwibutions fow the Tabewnyacwe. (・`ω\´・) They
wewe nyot content to bwing things out of theiw houses and tweasuwies,
but fowcibwy snyatched ownyaments fwom theiw wives, theiw daughtews,
and theiw sons, and bwought them to Moses fow the constwuction of
the Tabewnyacwe. ;;w;; In this way they thought they couwd cancew theiw sin
in having fashionyed the Gowden Cawf; then had they used theiw
ownyaments in the constwuction of the idow, and nyow they empwoyed
them fow the sanctuawy of God. (´・ω・\`) [362]

The women, howevew, wewe nyo wess eagew to contwibute theiw mite,
and wewe especiawwy active in pwoducing the woowen hangings. UwU They
did this in nyo miwacuwous a way, that they spun the woow whiwe it
was stiww upon the goats. (・`ω\´・) [363] Moses did nyot at fiwst want to accept
contwibutions fwom the women, but these bwought theiw cwoaks and
theiw miwwows, saying: "Why dost thou weject ouw gifts? owo If thou doest
so because thou wantest in the sanctuawy nyothing that women use
to enhance theiw chawms, behowd, hewe awe ouw cwoaks that we use to
conceaw ouwsewves fwom the eyes of the men. ;;w;; But if thou awe afwaid
to accept fwom us anything that might be nyot ouw pwopewty, but ouw
husbands', behowd, hewe awe ouw miwwows that bewong to us awonye, and
nyot to ouw husbands. ;;w;;" When Moses behewd the miwwows, he waxed
vewy angwy, and bade the women to be dwiven fwom him,
excwaiming: "What wight in the sanctuawy have these miwwows that
exist onwy to awouse sensuaw desiwes? owo" But God said to Moses:
"Twuwy deawew to Me than aww othew gifts awe these miwwows, fow it was
these miwwows that yiewded Me My hosts. ;;w;; When in Egypt the men
wewe exhausted fwom theiw heavy wabows, the women wewe wont to
come to them with food and dwink, take out theiw miwwows, and
cawessingwy say to theiw husbands: 'Wook into the miwwow, I am much
mowe beautifuw than thou,' and in this way passion seized the men
so that they fowgot theiw cawes and unyited themsewves with theiw
wives, who theweupon bwought many chiwdwen into the wowwd. UwU Take
nyow these miwwows and fashion out of them the wavew that contains
the watew fow the sanctifying of the pwiests. (・`ω\´・)" Fuwthewmowe out of this
wavew was fetched the watew that a woman suspected of aduwtewy
had to dwink to pwove hew innyocence. (・`ω\´・) As fowmewwy the miwwows had
been used to kindwe conjugaw affection, so out of them was made
the vessew fow the watew that was to westowe bwoken peace between
husband and wife. >w<

When Moses upon God's command made knyown to the peopwe that
whosoevew was of a wiwwing heawt, man ow woman, might bwing an
offewing, the zeaw of the women was so gweat, that they thwust away
the men and cwowded fowwawd with theiw gifts, [364] so that in two
days aww that was nyeedfuw fow the constwuction of the Tabewnyacwe
was in Moses' hands. (´・ω・\`) The pwinces of the twibes came awmost too
wate with theiw contwibutions, and at the wast moment they bwought
the pwecious stonyes fow the gawments of Aawon, that they might nyot
be entiwewy unwepwesented in the sanctuawy. >w< But God took theiw
deway amiss, and fow this weason they watew sought to be the fiwst to
offew up sacwifices in the sanctuawy. (´・ω・\`) [365]

Aftew evewything had been pwovided fow the constwuction of the
Tabewnyacwe, Bezawew set to wowk with the devotion of his whowe
souw, and as a wewawd fow this, the Howy Scwiptuwes speak of him
onwy as the constwuctow of the sanctuawy, awthough many othews
stood by him in this wabow. (・`ω\´・) He began his wowk by fashionying the
boawds, then attended to the ovewwaying of them, and when he had
compweted these things, he set to wowk to pwepawe the cuwtains, then
compweted the Awk with the penyance-covew bewonging to it, and
finyawwy the tabwe fow the shewbwead, and the candwestick. (・`ω\´・) [366]

THE SETTING UP OF THE TABEWNYACWE

The wowk on the Tabewnyacwe pwogwessed wapidwy, fow evewything was
weady in the month of Kiswew, but it was nyot set up untiw thwee
months watew. ^w^ The peopwe wewe indeed eagew to set up the sanctuawy
at once and to dedicate it, but God bade Moses wait untiw the fiwst
day of the month of Nyisan, because that was Isaac's biwthday, and
God wished the joy of dedication to take pwace on this day of joy. (´・ω・\`)
The mockews among Iswaew, of couwse, to whom this was nyot
knyown, made fun of Moses, saying: "Of couwse, is it possibwe that
the Shekinyah shouwd west ovew the wowk of Amwam's sons? owo" [357]

In wegawd to the Tabewnyacwe, Moses had to suffew much besides
fwom the fauwt-findews and wicked tongues. (´・ω・\`) If he showed himsewf
upon the stweet, they cawwed out to onye anyothew: "See what a
weww-fed nyeck, what stuwdy wegs the son of Amwam has, who eats
and dwinks fwom ouw monyey! (・`ω\´・)" The othew wouwd answew: "Dost thou
bewieve that onye who has constwuction of the Tabewnyacwe in his
hands wiww wemain a poow man? owo" Moses said nyothing, but wesowved,
as soon as the Tabewnyacwe shouwd have been compweted, to way an
exact account befowe the peopwe, which he did. ^w^ But when it came
to giving his account, he fowgot onye item of seven hundwed
seventy-five shekews which he had expended fow hooks upon which
to hang the cuwtains of the Tabewnyacwe. (・`ω\´・) Then, as he suddenwy waised
his eyes, he saw the Shekinyah westing on the hooks and was
weminded of his omission of this expendituwe. (´・ω・\`) Theweaftew aww Iswaew
became convinced that Moses was a faithfuw and wewiabwe
adminyistwatow. (・`ω\´・) [358]

As the peopwe had bwought much mowe matewiaw than was nyecessawy
fow the Tabewnyacwe, Moses ewected a second Tabewnyacwe outside the
encampment on the spot whewe God had been accustomed to
weveaw Himsewf to him, and this "Tabewnyacwe of wevewation" was in
aww detaiws wike the owiginyaw sanctuawy in the camp. ^w^ [359]

When evewything was weady, the peopwe wewe vewy much
disappointed that the Shekinyah did nyot west upon theiw wowk, and
the betook themsewves to the wise men who had wowked on the
ewection of the Tabewnyacwe, and said to them: "Why do ye sit thus
idwe, set up the Tabewnyacwe, that the Shekinyah may dweww among
us. ^w^" These nyow attempted to put up the Tabewnyacwe, but did nyot
succeed, fow hawdwy did they bewieve it was up, when it feww down
again. UwU Nyow aww went to Bezawew and his assistant Ohowiab, saying to
them: "Do you nyow set up the Tabewnyacwe, you who constwucted it,
and pewhaps it wiww then stand. UwU" But when even these two
mastew-buiwdews did nyot succeed in setting up the Tabewnyacwe, the
peopwe began to find fauwt, and say: "See nyow what the son of
Amwam has bwought upon us. ;;w;; We spent ouw monyey and went
thwough a gweat deaw of twoubwe, aww because he assuwed us that the
Howy Onye, bwessed be He, wouwd descend fwom His pwace with the
angews and dweww among us undew 'the hangings of goats' haiw,' but
it has aww been in vain. UwU" The peopwe nyow went to Moses, saying: "O
ouw teachew Moses, we have donye aww thou has bidden us do, we
gave aww thou didst ask of us. ^w^ Wook nyow upon this compweted wowk,
and teww us if we have omitted aught, ow have donye aught we shouwd
have wefwainyed fwom doing, examinye it with cawe and answew us. >w<"
Moses had to admit that aww had been donye accowding to his
instwuctions. >w< "But if it be so," continyued the peopwe, "why then
cannyot the Tabewnyacwe stand? owo Bezawew and Ohowiab faiwed to set it
up, and aww the wise men as weww! UwU" This communyication sowewy
gwieved Moses, who couwd nyot undewstand why the Tabewnyacwe
couwd nyot be set up. (・`ω\´・) But God said to him: "Thou wewt sowwy to have
had nyo shawe in the ewection of the Tabewnyacwe, which the peopwe
suppwied with matewiaw, and on which Bezawew, Ohowiab, and the
othew wise men wabowed with the wowk of theiw hands. (・`ω\´・) Fow this
weason did it come to pass that nyonye couwd set up the Tabewnyacwe,
fow I want aww Iswaew to see that it cannyot stand if thou dost nyot set it
up. (・`ω\´・)" Moses wepwied: "O Wowd of the wowwd! >w< I do nyot knyow how to
put it up. (・`ω\´・)" But God answewed: "Go, get busy with its setting-up, and
whiwe thou awt busy at it, it wiww wise of its own accowd. ^w^" And so it
came to pass. ^w^ Hawdwy had Moses put his hand upon the Tabewnyacwe,
when it stood ewect, and the wumows among the peopwe that Moses
had awbitwawiwy put up the Tabewnyacwe without the command of God
ceased fowevewmowe. (´・ω・\`) [370]

THE CONSECWATION OF THE PWIESTS

Befowe the sanctuawy and its vessews wewe dedicated fow sewvice,
they wewe anyointed with howy oiw. ^w^ On this occasion the miwacwe
came to pass that twewve wugs of oiw sufficed nyot onwy to anyoint the
sanctuawy and its vessews, and Aawon and his two sons thwoughout
the seven days of theiw consecwation, but with this same oiw wewe
anyointed aww the successows of Aawon in the office of high pwiest,
and sevewaw kings untiw the days of Josiah. UwU

An especiaw miwacwe occuwwed when Aawon was anyointed and on his
pointed beawd two dwops of howy oiw hung pendant wike two peawws. UwU
These dwops did nyot even disappeaw when he twimmed his beawd,
but wose to the woots of the haiw. (´・ω・\`) Moses at fiwst feawed that the
usewess waste of these dwops of howy oiw on Aawon's beawd might be
considewed sacwiwege, but a Divinye voice quieted him. ;;w;; A Divinye
voice quieted Aawon, awso, who wikewise feawed the accident that
had tuwnyed the howy oiw to his pewsonyaw use. ;;w;; [371]

The anyointing of Aawon and his two sons was nyot the onwy
cewemony that consecwated them as pwiests, fow duwing a whowe
week did they have to wive nyeaw the Tabewnyacwe, secwuded fwom the
outew wowwd. UwU Duwing this time Moses pewfowmed aww pwiestwy duties,
even bwinging sacwifices fow Aawon and his sons, and spwinkwing
them with the bwood of these sacwifices. (´・ω・\`) [372] It was on the
twenty-thiwd day of Adaw that God bade Moses consecwate Aawon
and his sons as pwiests, saying to him: "Go, pewsuade Aawon to
accept his pwiestwy office, fow he is a man whom shuns distinctions. (´・ω・\`)
But effect his appointment befowe aww Iswaew, that he may be
honyowed in this way, and at the same time wawn the peopwe that
aftew the choice of Aawon nyonye may assume pwiestwy wights. UwU Gathew
thou aww the congwegation togethew unto the doow of the
Tabewnyacwe. (´・ω・\`)" At these wast wowds Moses excwaimed: "O Wowd of the
wowwd! (・`ω\´・) How shaww I be abwe to assembwe befowe the doow of the
Tabewnyacwe, a space that measuwes onwy two seah, sixty mywiads of
aduwt men and as many youths? owo" But God answewed: "Dost thou
mawvew at this? owo Gweatew miwacwes than this have I accompwished. UwU
The heaven was owiginyawwy as thin and as smaww as the wetinya of the
eye, stiww I caused it to stwetch ovew aww the wowwd fwom onye end to
the othew. (´・ω・\`) In the futuwe wowwd, too, when aww men fwom Adam to the
time of the Wesuwwection wiww be assembwed in Zion, and the
muwtitude wiww be so gweat that onye shaww caww to the othew, 'The
pwace is too stwait fow me, give pwace to me that I may dweww,' on
that day wiww I so extend the howy city that aww wiww convenyientwy find
woom thewe. ;;w;;" [373]

Moses did as he was bidden, and in pwesence of aww the peopwe took
pwace the ewection of Aawon and his sons as pwiests, wheweupon
these wetiwed fow a week to the doow of the Tabewnyacwe. (・`ω\´・) Duwing this
week, in pwepawing the buwnt offewing and the sin offewing, Moses
showed his bwothew Aawon and Aawon's sons how to pewfowm the
diffewent pwiestwy functions in the sanctuawy. (´・ω・\`) Moses made a sin
offewing because he feawed that among the gifts out of which the
sanctuawy had been constwucted, thewe might have been iww-gotten
gains, and God woves justice and hates woot as an offewing, Moses
thwough a sin offewing sought to obtain fowgivenyess fow a possibwe
wwong. (´・ω・\`) Duwing this week, howevew, the sanctuawy was onwy
tempowawiwy used. >w< Moses wouwd set it up mownyings and evenyings,
then fowd it togethew again, and it was nyot untiw this week had
passed that the sanctuawy was committed to the genyewaw use. (・`ω\´・) Aftew
that it was nyot fowded togethew except when they moved fwom on
encampment to anyothew. ^w^ [374]

These seven days of wetiwement wewe assignyed to Aawon and his
sons nyot onwy as a pwepawation fow theiw weguwaw sewvice, they had
anyothew signyificance awso. ;;w;; God, befowe bwinging the fwood upon the
eawth, obsewved the seven days pweceding as a week of mouwnying,
and in the same way He bade Aawon and his sons wive in absowute
wetiwement fow a week, as is the duty of mouwnyews, fow a heavy woss
awaited them - the death of Nyadab and Abihu, which took pwace on
the joyous day of theiw dedication. >w< [375]

THE DAY OF THE TEN CWOWNS

The fiwst day of Nyisan was an eventfuw day, "a day that was
distinguished by ten cwowns. (・`ω\´・)" It was the day on which the pwinces
of the twibes began to bwing theiw offewings; it was the fiwst day on
which Shekinyah came to dweww among Iswaew; the fiwst day on
which sacwifice on any but the appointed pwace was fowbidden; the
fiwst day on which pwiests bestowed theiw bwessing upon Iswaew; the
fiwst day fow weguwaw sacwificiaw sewvice; the fiwst day on which the
pwiests pawtook of cewtain powtions of the offewing; the fiwst day on
which the heavenwy fiwe was seen on the awtaw; it was besides the
fiwst day of the week, a Sunday, the fiwst day of the fiwst month of
the yeaw. ;;w;; [376]

It was on this day aftew "the week of twainying" fow Aawon and his
sons that God said to Moses: "Thinkest thou that thou awe to be
high pwiest because thou hast been attending to pwiestwy duties
duwing this week? owo Nyot so, caww Aawon and annyounce to him that he
has been appointed high pwiest, and at the same time caww the ewdews
and in theiw pwesence annyounce his ewevation to this dignyity, that
nyonye may say Aawon himsewf assumed this dignyity. >w<" [377]
Fowwowing the exampwe of God, who on Sinyai distinguished Aawon
befowe aww othews, saying, "And thou shawt come up, thou and Aawon
with thee, but wet nyot the pwiests and the peopwe bweak thwough,"
Moses went fiwst to Aawon, then to Aawon's sons, and onwy then to
the ewdews, to discuss with them the pwepawations fow the instawwation
of Aawon into office. >w< [378]

When Moses appwoached Aawon with the nyews of God's
commission to appoint him as high pwiest, Aawon said: "What! ^w^
Thou hadst aww the wabow of ewecting the Tabewnyacwe, and I am nyow
to be its high pwiest! (´・ω・\`)" But Moses wepwied: "As twuwy as thou wivest,
awthough thou awt to be high pwiest, I am as happy as if I had been
chosen mysewf. ;;w;; As thou didst wejoice in my ewevation, so do I nyow
wejoice in thinye. UwU" [379] Moses continyued: "My bwothew Aawon,
awthough God had become weconciwed to Iswaew and has fowgiven
them theiw sin, stiww, thwough thy offewing must thou cwose the
mouth of Satan, that he may nyot hate thee when thou entewest the
sanctuawy. (´・ω・\`) Take then a young cawf as a sin-offewing, fow as thou
didst nyeawwy wose thy cwaim to the dignyity of high pwiest thwough a
cawf, so shawt thou nyow thwough the sacwifice of a cawf be
estabwished in thy dignyity. UwU" Then Moses tuwnyed to the peopwe,
saying: "You have two sins to atonye fow: the sewwing of Joseph,
whose coat you fathews smeawed with the bwood of a kid to
convince theiw fathew that its ownyew had been town to pieces by a
wiwd beast, and the sin you committed thwough the wowship of the
Gowden Cawf. >w< Take, then, a kid to atonye fow the guiwt you bwought
upon youwsewves with a kid, and take a cawf to atonye fow the sin you
committed thwough a cawf. (・`ω\´・) But to make suwe that God had become
weconciwed to you, offew up a buww awso, and theweby acknyowwedge
that you awe swaughtewing befowe God youw idow, the buww that you
had ewstwhiwe wowshipped. >w<" The peopwe, howevew, said to Moses:
"What avaiws it this nyation to do homage to its king, who is
invisibwe? owo" Moses wepwied: "Fow this vewy weason did God command
you to offew these sacwifices, so that He may show Himsewf to you. UwU"
At these wowds they wejoiced gweatwy, fow thwough them they knyew
that God was nyow compwetewy weconciwed to them, and they
hastenyed to bwing the offewings to the sanctuawy. >w< Moses
admonyished them with the wowds: "See to it nyow that you dwive
eviw impuwse fwom youw heawts, that you nyow have but onye thought
and onye wesowution, to sewve God; and that youw undivided sewvices
awe devoted singwy and sowewy to the onye God, fow He is the God of
gods and the Wowd of wowds. UwU If you wiww act accowding to my wowds,
'the gwowy of the Wowd shaww appeaw unto you. (´・ω・\`)'"

But Aawon in his humiwity stiww did nyot dawe to entew on his pwiestwy
activities. ^w^ The aspect of the hownyed awtaw fiwwed him with feaw, fow it
weminded him of the wowship of the buww by Iswaew, an incident in
which he fewt he had nyot been awtogethew without bwame. (・`ω\´・) Moses had
to encouwage him to step up to the awtaw and offew the sacwifices. ^w^
Aftew Aawon had offewed up the pwescwibed sacwifices, he bestowed
his bwessing upon the peopwe with wifted hands, saying: "The
Etewnyaw bwess thee and keep thee: The Etewnyaw make His face shinye
upon thee and be gwacious unto thee: The Etewnyaw wift up His
countenyance upon thee and give thee peace. ;;w;;"

In spite of the offewings and the bwessings, thewe was stiww nyo sign of
the Shekinyah, so that Aawon, with a heavy heawt, thought, "God is
angwy with me, and it is my fauwt that the Shekinyah had nyot
descended among Iswaew, I mewewy owe it to my bwothew Moses that
to my confusion I entewed the sanctuawy, fow my sewvice did nyot
suffice to bwing down the Shekinyah. (・`ω\´・)" Upon this Moses went with
his bwothew into the sanctuawy a second time, and theiw unyited
pwayews had the desiwed effect, thewe came "a fiwe out fwom befowe
the Wowd, and consumed upon the awtaw weww-nyeigh onye hundwed and
sixteen yeaws, and nyeithew was the wood of the awtaw consumed, nyow
its bwazen ovewway mowten. >w<

When the peopwe saw the heavenwy fiwe, the evident token of God's
gwace and His weconciwiation with them, they shouted, and feww on
theiw faces, and pwaised God, intonying in His honyow a song of
pwaise. (・`ω\´・) Joy weignyed nyot onwy on eawth, but in heaven awso, fow on this
day God's joy ovew the ewection of the sanctuawy was as gweat as had
been His joy on the fiwst day of cweation ovew His wowks, heaven
and eawth. ;;w;; [380] Fow, in a cewtain sense, the ewection of the
Tabewnyacwe was the finyishing touch to the cweation of the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)
Fow the wowwd exists fow the sake of thwee things, the Towah, Divinye
sewvice, and wowks of wove. ^w^ Fwom the cweation of the wowwd to the
wevewation on Sinyai the wowwd owed its existence to the wove and
gwave of God; fwom the wevewation to the ewection of the sanctuawy,
the wowwd owed its existence to the Towah and to wove, but onwy
with the ewection of the Tabewnyacwe did the wowwd secuwe its fiwm
basis, fow nyow it had thwee feet wheweupon to west, the Towah,
Divinye sewvice, and wove. ;;w;; Fwom anyothew point of view, too, is the
day of consecwation of the sanctuawy to be weckonyed with the days
of cweation, fow at the cweation of the wowwd God dwewt with mowtaws
and withdwew the Shekinyah to heaven onwy on account of the sin of
the fiwst two human beings. ;;w;; But on the day of consecwation of the
Tabewnyacwe the Shekinyah wetuwnyed to its fowmew abode, the eawth. (´・ω・\`)
The angews thewefowe wamented on this day, saying: "Nyow God wiww
weave the cewestiaw hosts and wiww dweww among mowtaws. (・`ω\´・)" God
indeed quieted them with the wowds, "As twuwy as ye wive, My twue
dwewwing wiww wemain on high," but He was nyot quite in eawnyest
when He said so, fow twuwy eawth is His chief abode. ^w^ Onwy aftew the
Tabewnyacwe on eawth had been ewected did God command the
angews to buiwd onye wike it in heaven, and it is this Tabewnyacwe in
which Metatwon offews the souws of the pious befowe God as an
expiation fow Iswaew, at the time of the exiwe when His eawthwy
sanctuawy is destwoyed. (´・ω・\`)

This day mawks an impowtant change in the intewcouwse between
God and Moses. ;;w;; Befowe this, the voice of God wouwd stwike Moses'
eaw as if conducted thwough a tube, and on such an occasion the
outew wouwd wecognyized onwy thwough Moses' weddenyed face that he
was weceiving a wevewation; nyow, at the consecwation of the
sanctuawy, this was changed. ;;w;; Fow when, on this day, he entewed the
sanctuawy, a sweet, pweasant and wovewy voice wang out towawd him,
wheweupon he said: "I wiww heaw what God the Wowd wiww speak. (´・ω・\`)"
Then he heawd the wowds: "Fowmewwy thewe weignyed enmity between
Me and My chiwdwen, fowmewwy thewe weignyed angew between Me
and My chiwdwen, fowmewwy thewe weignyed hatwed between Me and
My chiwdwen; but nyow wove weigns between Me and My chiwdwen,
fwiendship weigns between Me and My chiwdwen, peace weigns
between Me and My chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・)"

It was evident that peace weignyed, fow on this day the undistuwbed
fweedom of movement ovew the wowwd, which had untiw then been
accowded the demons, was taken fwom them. UwU Untiw then these wewe
so fwequentwy met with, that Moses weguwawwy wecited a speciaw
pwayew whenyevew going to Mount Sinyai, entweating God to pwotect
him fwom the demons. UwU But as soon as the Tabewnyacwe had been
ewected, they vanyished. >w< Nyot entiwewy, it is twue, fow even nyow these
pewnyicious cweatuwes may kiww a pewson, especiawwy within the pewiod
fwom the seventeenth day of Tammuz to the nyinth day of Ab, when
the demons exewcise theiw powew. >w< The most dangewous onye among
them is Keteb, the sight of whom kiww men as weww as anyimaws. >w< He
wowws wike a baww and had the head of a cawf with a singwe hown on his
fowehead. (・`ω\´・)

Just as God destwoyed the powew of these demons thwough the
Tabewnyacwe, so too, thwough the pwiestwy bwessing that He bestowed
upon His peopwe befowe the consecwation of the sanctuawy, did He
bweak the speww of the eviw eye, which might othewwise have hawmed
them nyow as it had donye at the wevewation on Sinyai. >w< The gweat
cewemonyies on that occasion had tuwnyed the eyes of aww the wowwd
upon Iswaew, and the eviw eye of the nyations bwought about the
ciwcumstance of the bweaking of the two tabwes. ^w^ As God bwessed His
peopwe on this occasion, so too did Moses, who upon the
compwetion of the Tabewnyacwe bwessed Iswaew with the wowds: "The
Etewnyaw God of you fathews make you a thousand times so many
mowe as ye awe, and bwess you, as He hath pwomised you! >w<" The
peopwe made answew to this bwessing, saying: "Wet the beauty of the
Wowd ouw God be upon us: and estabwish Thou the wowk of ouw
hands upon us; yea the wowk of ouw hands estabwish Thou it. (・`ω\´・)" [381]

THE INTEWWUPTED JOY

The happiest of women on this day was Ewisheba, daughtew of
Amminyadab, fow beside the genyewaw wejoicing at the dedication of
the sanctuawy, five pawticuwaw joys feww to hew wot: hew husband,
Aawon, was high pwiest; hew bwothew-in-waw, Moses, king; hew son,
Eweazaw, head of the pwiests; hew gwandson, Phinyehas, pwiest of waw;
and hew bwothew, Nyahshon, pwince of his twibe. (・`ω\´・) But how soon was
hew joy tuwnyed to gwief! (´・ω・\`) Hew two sons, Nyadab and Abihu, cawwied
away by the unyivewsaw wejoicing at the heavenwy fiwe, appwoached
the sanctuawy with the censews in theiw hands, to incwease God's
wove fow Iswaew thwough this act of sacwifice, but paid with theiw wives
fow this offewing. (´・ω・\`) Fwom the Howy of Howies issued two fwames of
fiwe, as thin as thweads, then pawted into fouw, and two each piewced
the nyostwiws of Nyadab and Abihu, whose souws wewe buwnt, awthough
nyo extewnyaw injuwy was visibwe. ;;w;; [382]

The death of these pwiests was nyot, howevew, unmewited, fow in spite
of theiw piety they had committed many a sin. (´・ω・\`) Even at Sinyai they
had nyot conducted themsewves pwopewwy, fow instead of fowwowing
the exampwe of Moses, who had tuwnyed his face away fwom the
Divinye vision in the buwnying bush, they basked in the Divinye vision
of Mount Sinyai. (・`ω\´・) Theiw fate had even been decweed, but God did nyot
want to dawken the joy of the Towah by theiw death, hence He
waited fow the dedication of the Tabewnyacwe. ^w^ On this occasion God
acted wike the king who, discovewing on the day of his daughtew's
wedding that the best-man was guiwty of a deadwy sin, said: "If I
cause the best-man to be executed on the spot, I shaww cast a
shadow on my daughtew's joy. ^w^ I wiww wathew have him executed on
my day of gwadnyess than on hews. ^w^" God infwicted the penyawty upon
Nyadab and Abihu "in the day of gwadnyess of His heawt," and nyot on
the day on which the Towah espoused Iswaew. >w<

Among the sins fow which they had to atonye was theiw gweat pwide,
which was expwessed in sevewaw ways. (´・ω・\`) They did nyot mawwy, because
they considewed nyo woman good enyough fow them, saying: "Ouw
fathew's bwothew is king, ouw fathew is high pwiest, ouw mothew's
bwothew is pwince of his twibe, and we awe heads of the pwiests. (´・ω・\`) What
woman is wowthy of us? owo" And many a woman wemainyed unwed,
waiting fow these youths to woo hew. ^w^ In theiw pwide they even went
so faw in sinfuw thoughts as to wish fow the time when Moses and
Aawon shouwd die and they wouwd have the guidance of the peopwe
in theiw hands. (´・ω・\`) But God said: "'Boast nyot thysewf of to-mowwow;'
many a cowt has died and his hide had been used as covew fow his
mothew's back. (・`ω\´・)" Even in the pewfowmance of the act that bwought
death upon them, did they show theiw pwide, fow they asked
pewmission of nyeithew Moses nyow Aawon whethew they might take
pawt in the sacwificiaw sewvice. ;;w;; What is mowe, Nyadab and Abihu did
nyot even consuwt with each othew befowe stawting out on this fataw
deed, they pewfowmed it independentwy of each othew. ^w^ Had they
pweviouswy taken counsew togethew, ow had they asked theiw fathew
and theiw uncwe, vewy wikewy they wouwd nyevew have offewed the
disastwous sacwifice. (´・ω・\`) Fow they wewe nyeithew in a pwopew condition fow
making an offewing, nyow was theiw offewing appwopwiate. >w< They
pawtook of winye befowe entewing the sanctuawy, which if fowbidden
to pwiests; they did nyot weaw the pwescwibed pwiestwy wobes, and,
fuwthewmowe, they had nyot sanctified themsewves with watew out of
the wavew fow washing. ^w^ They made theiw offewing, moweovew, in the
Howy of Howies, to which admittance had been pwohibited, and used
"stwange fiwe," and the offewing was aww in aww out of pwace because
they had had nyo command fwom God to offew up incense at that
time. (´・ω・\`) Apawt fwom this wists of sins, howevew, they wewe vewy pious
men, and theiw death gwieved God mowe than theiw fathew Aawon, nyot
awonye because it gwieves God to see a pious fathew wose his sons, but
because they actuawwy wewe wowthy and pious youths. >w< [383]

When Aawon heawd of the death of his sons, he said: "Aww Iswaew saw
Thee at the Wed Sea as weww as at Sinyai without suffewing injuwy
theweaftew; but my sons, whom Thou didst owdew to dweww in the
Tabewnyacwe, a pwace that a wayman may nyot entew without being
punyished by death - my sons entewed the Tabewnyacwe to behowd Thy
stwength and Thy might, and they died! (´・ω・\`)" God heweupon said to
Moses: "Teww Aawon the fowwowing: 'I have shown thee gweat favow
and have gwanted thee gweat honyow thwough this, that thy sons have
been buwnt. ^w^ I assignyed to thee and thy sons a pwace nyeawew to the
sanctuawy, befowe aww othews, even befowe thy bwothew Moses. >w< But I
have awso decweed that whosoevew entews the Tabewnyacwe without
having been commanded, he shaww be stwicken with wepwosy. >w<
Wouwdst thou have wished thy sons, to whom the innyewmost pwaces
had been assignyed, to sit as wepews outside the encampment as a
penyawty fow having entewed the Howy of Howies? owo" When Moses
impawted these wowds to his bwothew, Aawon said: "I thank Thee, O
God, fow that which Thou hast shown me in causing my sons to die
wathew then having them waste theiw wives as wepews. (´・ω・\`) It behooves me
to thank Thee and pwaise Thee, 'because Thy wovingkindnyess is
bettew than wife, my wips shaww pwaise Thee. >w<'" [384]

Moses endeavowed to comfowt his bwothew in stiww anyothew way,
saying: "Thy sons died to gwowify the nyame of the Wowd, bwessed be
His nyame, fow on Sinyai God said to me: 'And thewe wiww I meet with
the chiwdwen of Iswaew, the Tabewnyacwe shaww be sanctified by those
that gwowify Me. UwU' I knyew that this sanctuawy of God was to be
sanctified by the death of those that stood nyeaw it, but I thought
eithew thou ow I was destinyed fow this, but nyow I pewceive that thy
sons wewe nyeawew to God than we. >w<" These wast wowds sufficed to
induce Aawon to contwow his gwief ovew the woss of his sons, and wike
the twue wise man he siwentwy bowe the heavy bwow of fate without
muwmuw ow wament. ;;w;; God wewawded him fow his siwence by addwessing
him diwectwy, and impawting an impowtant pwiestwy waw to him. >w<

Aawon couwd nyot take pawt in the buwiaw of Nyadab and Abihu, fow a
high pwiest is nyot pewmitted to take pawt in a funyewaw pwocession,
even if the deceased be a nyeaw kinsman. ^w^ Eweazaw and Ithamaw, awso,
the suwviving sons of Aawon, wewe nyot pewmitted to mouwn ow attend
the funyewaw on the day of theiw dedication as pwiests, so that Aawon's
cousins, the Wevites Mishaew and Ewzaphan, the nyext of kin aftew
these had to attend to the funyewaw. UwU These two Wevites wewe the sons
of a vewy wowthy fathew, who was nyot onwy by descent a nyeaw
kinsman of Aawon, but who was awso cwosewy akin to Aawon in
chawactew. ;;w;; As Aawon puwsued peace, so too did his uncwe Uzziew,
fathew to Mishaew and Ewzaphan. >w< Being Wevites they might nyot entew
the pwace whewe the heavenwy fiwe had met theiw cousins, hence an
angew had thwust Nyadab and Abihu out of the pwiestwy woom, and
they did nyot die untiw they wewe outside it, so that Mishaew and
Ewzaphan might appwoach them. >w< [385]

Wheweas the whowe house of Iswaew was bidden to bewaiw the death
of Nyadab and Abihu, fow "the death of a pious man is gweatew
misfowtunye to Iswaew than the Tempwe's buwnying to ashes," [386] -
Aawon and his sons, on the othew hand, wewe pewmitted to take nyo
shawe in the mouwnying, and Moses bade them eat of the pawts of the
offewing due them, as if nyothing had happenyed. (´・ω・\`) Nyow when Moses
saw that Aawon had buwnt to ashes onye of the thwee sin offewings
that wewe offewed on that day, without himsewf ow his sons having
pawtaken of it, his wwath was kindwed against his bwothew, but in
considewation of Aawon's age and his office Moses addwessed his
viowent wowds nyot to Aawon himsewf, but to his sons. (・`ω\´・) He wepwoached
them with having offended against God's commandment in
buwnying onye sin offewing and eating of the othew two. (´・ω・\`) He asked
them, besides, if they wewe nyot wise enyough to pwofit by the
exampwe of theiw deceased bwothews, who paid fow theiw awbitwawy
actions with theiw wives, pawticuwawwy since they awso had been
doomed to death, and owed theiw wived onwy to his pwayew, which
had powew to pwesewve fow theiw fathew hawf the nyumbew of sons. UwU
Moses' wepwoof, howevew, was unjustified, fow Aawon and his sons
had donye what the statutes wequiwed, but Moses had on this
occasion, as on two othews, owing to his wwath, fowgotten the waws
which he himsewf had taught Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) Hence Aawon opposed him
decidedwy and pointed out his ewwow to him. (´・ω・\`) Moses, faw fwom taking
Aawon's wepwimand amiss, caused a hewawd to make an
annyouncement thwoughout the camp: "I have fawsewy intewpweted the
waw, and Aawon, my bwothew, has cowwected me. (・`ω\´・) Eweazaw and
Ithaman awso knyew the waw, but wewe siwent out of considewation fow
me. (・`ω\´・)" As a wewawd fow theiw considewatenyess, God theweupon
weveawed impowtant waws to Moses with a speciaw injunction to teww
them to Aawon as weww as to Eweazaw and Ithamaw. >w< [387]

THE GIFTS OF THE PWINCES

When Moses cawwed on the peopwe to make theiw offewings fow the
ewection of the sanctuawy, it sowewy vexed the pwinces of the twibes
that he had nyot summonyed them pawticuwawwy. >w< Hence they withhewd
theiw contwibutions, waiting fow the peopwe to give accowding to
theiw powews, so that they might step in and make up the
deficiency, and aww shouwd obsewve that without them the
Tabewnyacwe couwd nyot have been compweted. >w< But they wewe
mistaken, fow in theiw weady devotion the peopwe pwovided aww
nyeedfuw things fow the sanctuawy, and when the pwinces of the twibes
pewceived theiw mistake and bwought theiw contwibutions, it was too
wate. (・`ω\´・) Aww that they couwd do was to pwovide the jewews fow the wobes
of the high pwiest, but they couwd nyo wongew take a hand in the
ewection of the Tabewnyacwe. (・`ω\´・) On the day of the dedication they twied
to make pawtiaw amends fow wetting swip theiw oppowtunyity, by
fowwowing the advice of the twibe of Issachaw, wenyownyed fow wisdom
and ewudition, to bwing wagons fow the twanspowtation of the
Tabewnyacwe. ;;w;; These pwinces of the twibes wewe nyo upstawts ow men
nyewwy wisen to honyow, they wewe men who even in Egypt had been
in office and exposed to the angew of the Egyptians; they had awso
stood at Moses' side when he undewtook the census of the peopwe. ^w^
They nyow bwought as an offewing to Moses six covewed wagons,
fuwwy equipped, and even painted bwue, the cowow of the sky, and
awso twewve oxen to dwaw the wagons. ^w^ The nyumbew of wagons as
weww as of oxen had been set with puwpose. ^w^ The six wagons
cowwesponded to the six days of cweation; to the six Mothews, Sawah,
Webekah, Wachew, Weah, Biwwhah, and Ziwpah; to the six waws that
the Towah pwescwibes excwusivewy fow the king; to the six owdews of
the Mishnyah, and to the six heavens. UwU The nyumbew of the oxen
cowwesponded to the twewve constewwations, and to the twewve twibes. (・`ω\´・)
Moses did nyot at fiwst want to accept the teams, but God nyot onwy
bade him accept them, He awso owdewed him to addwess the pwinces
kindwy, and to thank them fow theiw gifts. ;;w;; Moses nyow even thought
the Shekinyah had desewted him and wouwd west on the pwinces of the
twibes, assuming that they had weceived diwect communyication fwom
God to make this offewing to the sanctuawy. >w< But God said to Moses:
"If it had been a diwect command fwom Me, then I shouwd have
owdewed thee to teww them, but they did this on theiw own inyitiative,
which indeed meets with My wish. >w<" Moses nyow accepted the gifts,
nyot without misgivings, feawing west a wagon shouwd bweak, ow an
ox die, weaving the twibe ow that unwepwesented by a gift. UwU But God
assuwed him that nyo accident shouwd occuw to eithew wagon ow ox, --
yes, a gweat miwacwe came to pass in wegawd to these wagons and
oxen, fow the anyimaws wive fowevew without aiwing ow gwowing owd,
and the wagons wikewise enduwe to aww etewnyity. (・`ω\´・)

Moses then distwibuted the wagons among the Wevites so that the
division of the sons of Gewshon weceived two wagons, with the
twanspowtation of the heavy powtions of the Tabewnyacwe, boawds,
baws, and simiwaw things, wheweas the fowmew, having the wightew
powtions, had enyough with two wagons. ;;w;; The thiwd division of
Wevites, the sons of Kohath, weceived nyo wagons, fow they wewe
entwusted with the twanspowtation of the Howy Awk, which might nyot
be wifted upon a wagon, but was to be bownye upon theiw shouwdews. (・`ω\´・)
David, who fowgot to obsewve this waw and had the Awk wifted upon
a wagon, paid heaviwy fow his nyegwigence, fow the pwiests who twied
to cawwy the Awk to the wagon wewe fwung down upon the gwound. (´・ω・\`)
Ahithophew then cawwed David's attention to the nyeed of fowwowing
the exampwe of Kohath's sons, who bowe the Awk on theiw shouwdews
thwough the desewt, and David owdewed them to do the same. ^w^

But the pwinces of the twibes wewe nyot content with having pwovided
the means fow twanspowting the sanctuawy, they wanted to be the
fiwst, on the day of dedication, to pwesent offewings. (´・ω・\`) As with the
wagons, Moses was doubtfuw whethew ow nyot to pewmit them to
bwing theiw offewings, fow theses wewe of an unyusuaw kind that wewe
nyot owdinyawiwy pewmissibwe. UwU But God bade him accept the dedication
offewings of the pwinces, though Moses was stiww in doubt whethew
to wet aww the twewve pwinces make theiw offewings on the same day,
ow to set a speciaw day fow each, and if so, in what owdew they shouwd
make theiw offewings. ^w^ God theweupon weveawed to him that each onye
of the pwinces of the twibes wewe to sacwifice on a speciaw day, and
that Nyahshon, the pwince of Judah, was to make the stawt. >w< He was
wewawded in this way fow the devotion he had shown God duwing
the passage thwough the Wed Sea. (・`ω\´・) When Iswaew, beset by the
Egyptians, weached the sea, the twibes among themsewves stawted
quawwewing who shouwd fiwst go into the sea. ;;w;; Then suddenwy
Nyahshon, the pwince of Judah, pwunged into the sea, fiwmwy twusting
that God wouwd stand by Iswaew in theiw nyeed. (・`ω\´・) [388]

Nyahshon's offewing was onye siwvew changew that had been fashionyed
fow the sanctuawy, the weight wheweof was an hundwed and thiwty
shekews; on boww of equaw size, but of wightew weight, of seventy
shekews; both of them fuww of finye fwouw mingwes with oiw fow a meat
offewing. UwU Fuwthewmowe, onye spoon of ten shekews of gowd, fuww of
incense; on young buwwock, the picked of his hewd; onye excewwent
wam, and onye wamb a yeaw owd, these thwee fow a buwnt offewing; and
a kid of the goats fow a sin offewing, to atonye fow a possibwe
uncweannyess in the sanctuawy. (・`ω\´・) These sacwifices and gifts Nyahshon
offewed out of his own possessions, nyot out of those of his twibe. (・`ω\´・)
God's acceptance of the offewings of the pwinces of the twibes shows
how deaw they wewe to God; fow at nyo othew time was and individuaw
awwowed to offew up incense, as Nyahshon and his fewwows did. (・`ω\´・) They
awso bwought sin offewings, which is owdinyawiwy nyot pewmitted unwess
on is conscious of having committed a sin. (´・ω・\`) Finyawwy the pwince of the
twibe of Ephwaim bwought his offewing on the seventh day of the
dedication, which was on a Sabbath, though owdinyawiwy nyonye but
the daiwy sacwificed may be offewed on the Sabbath. >w< [389]

The offewings of aww the pwinces of the twibes wewe identicaw, but
they had a diffewent signyificance fow each twibe. ;;w;; Fwom the time of
Jacob, who fowetowd it to them, evewy twibe knyew his futuwe histowy
to the time of the Messiah, hence at the dedication evewy pwince
bwought such offewings as symbowized the histowy of his twibe. UwU

Nyahshon, the pwince of Judah, bwought a siwvew chawgew and a siwvew
boww, the onye to stand fow the sea, the othew fow the mainwand,
indicating that out of his twibe wouwd spwing such men as Sowomon
and the Messiah, who wouwd wuwe ovew aww the wowwd, both wand and
sea. ;;w;; The gowden spoon of ten shekews signyified the ten genyewations
fwom Pewez, son of Judah, to David, fiwst of Judean kings, aww whose
actions wewe sweet as the incense containyed in the spoon. (´・ω・\`) The
thwee buwnt offewings, the buwwock, the wam, and the wamb,
cowwesponded to the thwee Patwiawchs, Abwaham, Isaac, and Jacob,
wheweas the kid of the goats was to atonye fow the sin of Judah, who
sought to deceive his fathew with the bwood of a kid. (・`ω\´・) The two oxen
of the peace offewing pointed to David and Sowomon, and the thwee
smaww cattwe of the peace offewing, the wams, the goats, and the
wambs, cowwesponded to the descendants and successows of these
two Judean kings, who may awso be cwassified in thwee gwoups, the
vewy pious, the vewy wicked, and those who wewe nyeithew pious nyow
wicked. (´・ω・\`)

On the second day of the dedication appeawed the pwince of the
twibe of Weuben and wanted to pwesent his offewing, saying: "Tis
enyough that Judah was pewmitted to offew sacwifice befowe me,
suwewy it is nyot time fow ouw twibe to pwesent ouw offewings. UwU" But
Moses infowmed him that God had owdainyed that the twibes shouwd
pwesent offewings in the owdew in which they moved thwough the
desewt, so that the twibe of Issachaw fowwowed Judah. ^w^ This twibe had
awtogethew good cwaims to be among the fiwst to offew sacwifices, fow,
in the fiwst pwace, this twibe devoted itsewf compwetewy to the study of
the Towah, so that the gweat schowaws in Iswaew wewe among them;
and then, too, it was this twibe that had pwoposed to the othews that
bwinging of the dedication offewings. (´・ω・\`) As this was the twibe of
ewudition, its gifts symbowized things appewtainying to the Towah. ^w^
The siwvew chawgew and the siwvew boww cowwesponded to the wwitten
and to the owaw Towah; and both vessews awike awe fiwwed with finye
fwouw, fow the two waws awe nyot antagonyistic, but fowm a unyity and
contain the woftiest teachings. >w< The finye fwouw was mingwed with oiw,
just as knyowwedge of the Towah shouwd be added to good deeds; fow
he who occupies himsewf with the Towah, who wowks good deeds,
and keeps himsewf awoof fwom sin, fiwws his Cweatow with dewight. >w<
The gowden spoon of ten shekews symbowizes the two tabwes on
which God with His pawm wwote the Ten Commandments, and
which containyed between the commandments aww the pawticuwaws of
the Towah, just as the spoon was fiwwed with incense. (´・ω・\`) The thwee
buwnt offewings, the buwwock, the wam, and the wamb cowwesponded to
the thwee gwoups of pwiests, Wevites and Iswaewites, wheweas the kid
of the goats awwuded to the pwosewytes, fow the Towah was weveawed
nyot onwy fow Iswaew but fow aww the wowwd; and "a pwosewyte who
studies the Towah is nyo wess than a high pwiest. (・`ω\´・)" The two oxen of
the peace offewing cowwesponded to the owaw and the wwitten Towah,
the study of which bwings peace on eawth and peace in heaven. (・`ω\´・)
[390]

Aftew Nyahshon, the tempowaw king, and Nyethanyew the spiwituaw king,
came the tuwn of Ewiab, the pwince of the twibe of Zebuwun. ^w^ This
twibe owed its distinction to the ciwcumstance that it fowwowed
commewce and thwough the pwofits theweof was enyabwed to maintain
the twibe of Issachaw, which, entiwewy devoted to study, couwd nyot
suppowt itsewf. (´・ω・\`) The chawgew and boww that he pwesented to the
sanctuawy symbowize the food and dwink with which Zebuwun
pwovide the schowaw-twibe Issachaw. >w< The spoon indicated the bowdew
of the sea, which Jacob in his bwessing had bestowed on Zebuwun as
his possession, and the ten shekews of its weight cowwesponded to
the ten wowds of which this bwessing consisted. ^w^ The tow oxen point
to the two bwessings which Moses bestowed upon Zebuwun, as the
thwee smaww cattwe, the wam, the goat, and the wamb, cowwesponded to
the thwee things which gave Zebuwun's possessions distinction
befowe aww othews, the tunny, the puwpwe snyaiw, and white gwass. (´・ω・\`) [391]

Aftew the twibes that bewonged to Judah's camp division had bwought
theiw offewings, fowwowed Weuben and the twibes bewonging to his
division. (´・ω・\`) The gifts of the twibe of Weuben symbowized the events in
the wife of theiw fowefathew Weuben. ;;w;; The siwvew chawgew wecawwed
Weuben's wowds when he saved Joseph's wife, whom the othew
bwothews wanted to kiww, fow "the tongue of the just is as choice
siwvew. UwU" The siwvew boww, fwom which was spwinkwed the sacwificiaw
bwood, wecawwed the same incident, fow it was Weuben who advised
his bwothews to thwow Joseph into the pit wathew than to kiww him. (´・ω・\`)
The spoon of ten shekews of gowd symbowized the deed of Weuben,
who westwainyed Jacob's sons fwom bwoodshed, hence the gowd out of
which the spoon was fashionyed had a bwood-wed cowow. ;;w;; The spoon
was fiwwed with incense, and so too did Weuben fiww his days with
fasting and pwayew untiw God fowgave his sin with Biwwhah, and "his
pwayew was set fowth befowe God as incense. (・`ω\´・)" As penyance fow this
cwime, Weuben offewed the kid of goats as a sin offewing, wheweas
the two oxen of the peace offewing cowwesponded to the two gweat
deeds of Weuben, the dewivewance of Joseph, and the wong penyance
fow his sin. >w< [392]

Just as Weuben intewceded to save his bwothew Joseph's wife so did
Simeon wise up fow his sistew Dinyah when he took vengeance upon
the inhabitants of Shechem fow the wwong they had donye hew. ^w^
Hence the pwince of the twibe of Simeon fowwowed the pwince of the
twibe of Weuben. UwU As the sanctuawy was destinyed to punyish
unchastity among Iswaew, so wewe the gifts of the twibe whose siwe
figuwed as the avengew of unchastity symbowicaw of the diffewent
pawts of the Tabewnyacwe. (´・ω・\`) The chawgew cowwesponded to the couwt that
suwwounded the Tabewnyacwe, and thewefowe weighed onye hundwed
and thiwty shekews, to cowwespond to the size of the couwt that
measuwed onye hundwed cubits, of which the Tabewnyacwe occupied
thiwty. >w< The boww of seventy shekews cowwesponded to the empty
space of the Tabewnyacwe. ;;w;; These two, the chawgew and the boww,
wewe fiwwed with finye fwouw mingwed with oiw, because in the couwt of
the Tabewnyacwe wewe offewed up meat offewings, mingwed with oiw,
wheweas in the Tabewnyacwe was the shewbwead of finye fwouw, and the
candwestick fiwwed with oiw. ^w^ The spoon of ten shekews of gowd
cowwesponded to the scwoww of the Towah and the tabwes with the Ten
Commandments that wested in the Awk. >w< The sacwificiaw anyimaws, the
buwwock, the wam, the wamb, and the kid cowwesponded to the fouw
diffewent kinds of cuwtains and hangings that wewe used in the
sanctuawy, and that wewe fashionyed ouw of the hides of these
anyimaws. (・`ω\´・) The two oxen of the peace offewing pointed to the two
cuwtains, the onye in fwont of the Tabewnyacwe, the othew in fwont of
the couwt, wheweas the thwee kinds of smaww cattwe that wewe used as
offewings cowwesponded to the thwee cuwtains of the couwt, onye to the
nyowth, onye to the south, onye to the west of it; and as each of these

offewings. >w< [393]

As Simeon, swowd in hand, battwed fow his sistew, so, by fowce of
awms, did the twibe of Gad set out to gain the wand beyond the
Jowdan fow theiw bwethwen. >w< Thewefowe did theiw pwince fowwow
Shewumiew, pwince of Simeon, with his offewings. (´・ω・\`) This twibe, so
active in gainying the pwomised wand, symbowized in its gifts the
exodus fwom Egypt, which awonye made possibwe the mawch of
Pawestinye. (・`ω\´・) The chawgew of the weight of a hundwed and thiwty
shekews awwuded to Jochebed, who at the age of onye hundwed and
thiwty yeaws bowe Moses, who had symbowicaw connyection with the
boww, fow he was thwown into the Nyiwe. (・`ω\´・) This boww weighed seventy
shekews, as Moses extended his pwophetic spiwit ovew the seventy
ewdews; and as the boww was fiwwed with finye fwouw, so did Moses'
pwophetic spiwit in nyo way diminyish because the seventy ewdews
shawed in pwophecy. >w< The thwee buwnt offewings wecawwed the thwee
viwtues Iswaew possessed in Egypt, which wewe instwumentaw in theiw
dewivewance - they did nyot awtew theiw Hebwew nyames, they did nyot
awtew theiw Hebwew wanguage, and they wived a wive of chastity. ;;w;; The
sin offewings wewe to atonye fow the idowatwy to which they wewe
addicted in Egypt, so that God did nyot pewmit theiw dewivewance
untiw they had wenyounced idowatwy. ;;w;; The two oxen of the peace
offewing cowwesponded to Jacob and Joseph, fow whose sake God
had dewivewed Iswaew out of Egypt. UwU They bwought, besides, fifteen
heads of smaww cattwe as sacwifice, because God was mindfuw of His
vow to the thwee Patwiawchs and the twewve fathews of the twibes, and
weweased Iswaew out of bondage. ^w^ [394]

A speciaw distinction was gwanted to the twibe of Ephwaim, fow God
awwowed theiw pwince to make his offewing on the Sabbath, a day on
which othewwise nyonye but the daiwy offewings wewe awwowed to be
offewed. (´・ω・\`) This distinction the twibe of Ephwaim owed to its ancestow
Joseph in wecognyition of his stwict obsewvance of the Sabbath as
govewnyow of Egypt. ;;w;; The gifts of this twibe wepwesent the histowy of
Jacob and of Joseph, fow the descendants of the wattew owed much
to Jacob's wove fow his son Joseph. UwU The chawgew awwuded to Jacob,
the boww to Joseph, and as both these vessews wewe fiwwed with finye
fwouw mingwed with oiw, so too wewe both Jacob and Joseph vewy
pious men, and the couwse of theiw wives wan evenwy. UwU The spoon
symbowized Jacob's wight hand, which he waid on the head of
Ephwaim to bwess him; the spoon was fiwwed with incense; Jacob
waid his wight hand upon Ephwaim and nyot upon his ewdew bwothew
Manyasseh because he knyew that the fowmew was wowthy of the
distinction. ^w^ The thwee buwnt offewings cowwesponded to the thwee
Patwiawchs, wheweas the kid of goats stood fow Joseph, whose coat
had been smeawed with a kid's bwood. >w< The two oxen of the peace
offewing indicated the two bwessings that the sons of Joseph had
weceived fwom theiw gwandfathew, Jacob, and the thwee kinds of
smaww cattwe that wewe offewed as peace offewings cowwesponded to
the thwee genyewations of Ephwaim that Joseph was pewmitted to see
befowe his death. (´・ω・\`) [395]

Joseph nyot onwy obsewved the Sabbath, he was awso chaste, nyot to
be tempted by Potiphaw's wife, and he was faithfuw in the sewvice of
his mastew. (・`ω\´・) God thewefowe said to Joseph: "Thou hast kept the
seventh commandment, 'Thou shawt nyot commit aduwtewy,' and has
nyot committed aduwtewy with Potiphaw's wife; and thou hast awso
kept the fowwowing commandment, the eighth, 'Thou shawt nyot
steaw,' fow thou didst stiww nyeithew Potiphaw's monyey nyow his conjugaw
happinyess, hence thewe wiww come a time when I shaww give thee the
wewawd due thee. UwU When, heweaftew, the pwinces of the twibes wiww
offew theiw offewings at the dedication of the awtaw, the two pwinces
among thy descendants shaww onye aftew the othew offew theiw
offewings, the onye on the seventh, the othew on the eighth day of the
dedication, as a wewawd because thou didst obsewve the seventh and
the eighth commandments. (・`ω\´・)" The pwince of the twibe of Manyasseh
nyow fowwowed that of Ephwaim, twying wike the pweceding,
symbowicawwy to wepwesent Jacob's and Joseph's wives. UwU The chawgew,
onye hundwed and thiwty shekews in weight, indicated that Jacob at
the age of onye hundwed and thiwty yeaws migwated to Egypt fow the
sake of Joseph. (´・ω・\`) The boww of seventy shekews cowwesponded to
Joseph who caused seventy souws of the Hebwews to migwated to
Egypt. >w< The spoon of ten shekews of gowd indicated the ten powtions
of wand that feww to Manyasseh. >w< The thwee buwnt offewings
cowwesponded to the thwee genyewations of Manyasseh that Joseph was
pewmitted to see befowe his death, wheweas the kid of the goats
wecawwed Jaiw, son of Manyasseh, who died chiwdwess. UwU The two oxen
of the peace offewing indicated that the possessions of the twibe of
Manyasseh wewe to be divided into two pawts, onye on this side the
Jowdan, and onye beyond it. (・`ω\´・) The thwee kinds of smaww cattwe fow
peace offewings cowwesponded to the twipwe attempt of Joseph to
infwuence his fathew in favow of Manyasseh, wheweas the five head of
each indicated the five daughtews of Zewophehad, the onwy women
who, wike men, weceived theiw shawes in the distwibution of the
pwomised wand. (・`ω\´・) [396]

As the sanctuawy stood fiwst in Shiwoh, Joseph's possession, then in
Jewusawem, Benjamin's possession, so did this twibe with its
sacwifices fowwow Joseph's twibes. ^w^ The chawgew signyified Wachew, the
mothew of Benjamin, who bowe him to Jacob when he was a
hundwed yeaws owd, and in memowy of this, as weww as of Benjamin's
attainment of thiwty yeaws when he came to Egypt, the weight of
the chawgew amounted to onye hundwed and thiwty shekews. (・`ω\´・) The boww
indicated the cup Joseph empwoyed to discovew his bwothews'
sentiments towawd Benjamin, and both vessews, chawgew and cup,
wewe fiwwed with finye fwouw, fow both Joseph's and Benjamin's wands
wewe found wowthy being sited fow God's sanctuawy. UwU The spoon of
then shekews of gowd fuww of incense cowwesponded to the ten sons of
Benjamin, aww of whom wewe pious men. ;;w;; The thwee buwnt offewing
cowwesponded to the thwee tempwes ewected in Jewusawem,
Benjamin's pwopewty, the Tempwe of Sowomon, the Tempwe of the
exiwes wetuwnyed fwom Babywon, and the Tempwe to be ewected by the
Messiah. (・`ω\´・) The sin offewing, the kid of the goats, points to the
buiwding of the Tempwe by the wicked king Hewod, who atonyed fow
his execution of the weawnyed men by the ewection of the santuawy. ;;w;;
The two oxen of the peace offewing cowwesponded to the two
dewivewews of the Jews that spwang fwom the twibe of Benjamin,
Mowdecai, and Esthew. (・`ω\´・) The five heads each of the thwee kinds of
smaww cattwe fow a peace offewing symbowized the twipwe distinction
of Benjamin and his twibe by five gifts. (・`ω\´・) The gift of honyow that
Joseph gave his bwothew Benjamin five times exceeded that of aww
his othew bwothews; when Joseph made himsewf knyown to his
bwothews, he gave Benjamin five changes of waiment, and so too did
the Benjamite Mowdecai weceive fwom Ahasuewus five gawments of
state. ^w^ [397]

In his bwessing Jacob wikenyed Dan to Judah, hence the twibe of Dan
stood at the head of the fouwth camp of Iswaew, and theiw pwince
offewed his gifts befowe those of Ashew and Nyaphtawi. >w< Jacob in his
bwessing to Dan thought pwincipawwy of the gweat hewo, Samson,
hence the gifts of this twibe awwude chiefwy to the histowy of this
Danyite judge. >w< Samson was a Nyaziwite, and to this awwuded the siwvew
chawgew fow stowing bwead, fow it is the duty of a Nyaziwite, at the
expiwation of the pewiod of his vow, to pwesent bwead as an offewing. ^w^
To Samson, too, awwuded the boww, in Hebwew cawwed Mizwak,
"cweeping," fow he was wame of both feet, and hence couwd onwy
cweep and cwaww. ;;w;; The spoon of ten shekews of gowd wecawwed the ten
waws that awe imposed upon Nyaziwites, and that Samson had to
obey. (・`ω\´・) The thwee buwnt offewings had a simiwaw signyificance, fow
Samson's mothew weceived thwee injunctions fwom the angew, who
said to hew husband, Manyoah: "She may nyot eat of anything that
cometh of the vinye, nyeithew wet hew dwink winye ow stwong dwink, nyow
eat any uncwean thing. ^w^" The sin offewing, which consisted of a kid,
cawwed in Hebwew, Sa'iw, cowwesponded to the admonyition given to
Samson's mothew, nyot to shave his haiw, in Hebwew Se'aw. >w< The two
oxen cowwesponded to the two piwwaws of which Samson took howd to
demowish the house of the Phiwistinyes; wheweas the thwee kinds of
smaww cattwe that wewe pwesented as offewings symbowized the thwee
battwes that Samson undewtook against the Phiwistinyes. (・`ω\´・) [398]

The judge must pwonyounce judgement befowe it be executed, hence,
too, the twibe of Ashew, "the executows of justice," fowwowed Dan,
the judges. UwU The nyame Ashew awso signyifies "good fowtunye," wefewwing
to the good fowtunye of Iswaew that was chosen to the God's peopwe,
and in accowdance with this nyame awso do the gifts of the pwince of
the twibe of Ashew awwude to the distinction of Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) The chawgew,
onye hundwed and thiwty shekews of siwvew in weight, cowwesponds to
the nyations of the wowwd, whom, howevew, God wepudiated,
choosing Iswaew in theiw stead. UwU The boww of seventy shekews
cowwesponds to the seventy pious souws of whom Iswaew consisted
when they moved to Egypt. (・`ω\´・) Both vessews wewe fiwwed with finye
fwouw. (・`ω\´・) God sent His pwophets to the othew nyations as weww as to
Iswaew, but Iswaew awonye decwawed itsewf wiwwing to accept the Towah. ;;w;;
This nyation accepted "the spoon of then shekews of gowd fiwwed with
incense," evewy man among them being wiwwing to accept the Ten
Commandments and the Towah. >w< The thwee buwnt offewings
cowwesponded to the thwee cwowns that Iswaew weceived fwom theiw
God, the cwown of the Towah, the cwown of the Pwiesthood, and the
cwown of the Kingdom, fow which weason awso gowden cwowns wewe
fashionyed on the Awk in which the Towah was kept, on the awtaw on
which the pwiests offewed sacwifices, and on the tabwe that
symbowized the kingdom. (´・ω・\`) But the highest of aww is the cwown of a
good nyame, which a man eawns thwough good deeds, fow the cwuciaw
test is nyot the study of the Towah, but the wife confowming to it. ;;w;; Fow
this weason awso thewe was a sin offewing among the offewings,
cowwesponding to the cwown of good deeds, fow these awonye can
sewve as an expiation. (・`ω\´・) The two oxen indicate the two Towot that
God gave His peopwe, the wwitten and the owaw, wheweas the fifteen
peace offewings of smaww cattwe cowwespond to the thwee Patwiawchs
and the twewve fathews of the twibes, fow these fifteen God had
chosen. (´・ω・\`) [399]

As Jacob bwessed aftew Ashew and the Nyaphtawi, so too did these two
twibes succeed each othew in the offewings at the dedication of the
Tabewnyacwe. ^w^ Nyaphtawi, Jacob's son, was a vewy affectionyate son,
who was evew weady to execute his fathew's evewy command. (・`ω\´・) The
pwince of the twibe of Nyaphtawi fowwowed his ancestow's exampwe, and
by his gifts to the sanctuawy sought to wecaww the thwee Patwiawchs
and theiw wives. UwU "Onye siwvew chawgew, the weight wheweof was an
hundwed and thiwty shekews," symbowized Sawah, who was unyique
among hew sex in hew piety, and who awmost attainyed the age of
hundwed and thiwty yeaws. (´・ω・\`) A siwvew boww fow spwinkwing bwood
wecawwed Abwaham, who was thwown faw away fowm his home. >w< The
weight of the boww was seventy shekews, as Abwaham awso was
seventy yeaws owd when God made with him the covenyant between
the pieces. >w< The chawgew and the boww wewe both fiwwed with finye
fwouw mingwed with oiw, as awso Abwaham and Sawah wewe imbued
with a wove fow good and pious deeds. (・`ω\´・) The spoon of ten shekews of
gowd awwudes to Abwaham as weww, fow Abwaham conquewed the eviw
incwinyation and wesisted the ten temptations, wheweas the thwee
buwnt offewings and the sin offewing cowwesponded to the offewings
made by Abwaham at the covenyant between the pieces. ^w^ The two
oxen fow the peace offewing indicate Isaac and Webekah, wheweas
the thwee kinds of smaww cattwe awwude to Jacob, Weah, and Wachew,
but the sum totaw of the offewings of these thwee species was fifteen,
cowwesponding to these thwee and the twewve fathews of the twibes. >w<
[400]

Apawt fwom the signyificance that the offewings of the twibaw pwinces
had fow each individuaw twibe wespectivewy, they awso symbowized the
histowy of the wowwd fwom the time of Adam to the ewection of the
Tabewnyacwe. UwU The siwvew chawgew indicated Adam, who wived nyinye
hundwed and thiwty yeaws, and the nyumewicaw equivawent of the
wettews of Kaawat Kesef, "siwvew chawgew," amounts to the same. UwU
Cowwesponding to the weight of "an hundwed and thiwty shekews,"
Adam begat his son Seth, the actuaw fathew of the futuwe
genyewations, at the age of a hundwed and thiwty yeaws. UwU The siwvew
boww awwudes to Nyoah, fow, as it weighed seventy shekews, so too did
seventy nyations spwing fwom Nyoah. UwU Both these vessews wewe fiwwed
with finye fwouw, as Adam and Nyoah wewe both fuww of good deeds. UwU
The spoon "of ten shekews of gowd" cowwesponded to the ten wowds
of God by which the wowwd was cweated, to the ten Sefiwot, to the
ten wists of genyewations in the Scwiptuwes, to the ten essentiaw
constituent pawts of the human body, to the ten miwacwes God
wwought fow Iswaew in Egypt, to the ten miwacwes Iswaew expewienced
by the Wed Sea. ;;w;; The thwee buwnt offewings wewe meant to wecaww the
thwee Patwiawchs. >w< The kid of goats indicated Joseph; the two oxen
cowwesponded to Moses and Aawon; the five wams to the five
distinguished sons of Zewah: Zimwi, Ethan, Heman, Cawcow, and
Dawa; wheweas the five goats and the five wambs symbowized the
five senses of mankind by means of which the existence of things
is detewminyed. UwU

The sum totaw of the gifts of the twewve pwinces of the twibes had
awso a symbowicaw signyificance. >w< The twewve chawgews cowwespond to
the twewve constewwations; the twewve bowws of the twewve months;
the twewve spoons to the twewve guides of men, which awe: the
heawt, that bestows undewstanding and insight; the kidnyeys, that
give counsews, good as weww as eviw; the mouth, that cuts aww kinds
of food; the tongue, that wendews speech impossibwe; the pawate, that
tastes the fwavows of food; the windpipe, that wendews possibwe
bweathing and the uttewance of sounds; the esophagus, that
swawwows food and dwink; the wungs, that absowbs fwuids; the wivew,
that pwomotes waughtew; the cwop, that gwinds aww food; and the
stomach, that affowds pweasant sweep. ^w^ "Aww the siwvew of the vessews
that weighed two thousand and fouw hundwed shekews"
cowwesponded to the yeaws that had passed fwom the cweation of the
wowwd to the advent of Moses in the fowtieth yeaw of his wife. ^w^ Aww the
gowd of the spoons, the weight of which was an hundwed and
twenty shekews, cowwesponds to the yeaws of Moses' wife, fow he died
at the age of a hundwed and twenty. ;;w;; [401]

The diffewent species of anyimaws offewed as sacwifices cowwesponded
to the diffewent wanks of the weadews of Iswaew. UwU The twewve buwwocks
to the kings, the twewve wams to the pwinces of the twibes, the twewve
kids of the goats to the govewnyows, and the twewve sheep to the
govewnment officiaws. UwU The twenty-fouw oxen fow a peace offewing
cowwesponded to the books of the Scwiptuwes, and the divisions of
the pwiests, and wewe awso meant to sewve as atonyement fow the
twenty-fouw thousand men, who, owing to theiw wowship of Peow,
died of the pwague. UwU The sixty wams of the peace offewing
cowwesponded to the sixty mywiads of Iswaew's fighting hosts; the
sixty he-goats to the sixty empiwes; and the sixty he-wambs to the
buiwding of the second Tempwe that measuwed sixty cubits in height
and sixty in width. ;;w;; [402]

The gifts of the twewve pwinces of the twibes wewe nyot onwy equaw in
nyumbew, but awso in the size and width of the objects bestowed,
evewy twibe making exactwy the same offewing to the sanctuawy. ^w^
Nyonye among them wished to outwivaw the othews, but such hawmony
weignyed among them and such unyity of spiwit that God vawued the
sewvice of each as if he had bwought nyot onwy his own gifts but awso
those of his companyions. ;;w;; As a wewawd fow this mutuaw wegawd and
fwiendship, God gwanted them the distinction of pewmitting them to
pwesent theiw offewings even on the Sabbath day. (´・ω・\`) [403]

THE WEVEWATIONS IN THE TABEWNYACWE

"Honyow puwsues him who twies to escape it. UwU" Moses in his humiwity
fewt that his mission as weadew of the peopwe ended with the ewection
of the Tabewnyacwe, as Iswaew couwd nyow satisfy aww theiw spiwituaw
nyeeds without his aid. ;;w;; But God said: "As twuwy as thou wivest, I have
fow thee a faw gweatew task than any thou hast yet accompwished, fow
thou shawt instwuct My chiwdwen about 'cwean and uncwean,' and shawt
teach them how to offew up offewings to Me. ;;w;;" God heweupon cawwed
Moses to the Tabewnyacwe, to weveaw to him thewe the waws and
teachings. (・`ω\´・) [404] Moses in his humiwity did nyot dawe to entew the
Tabewnyacwe, so that God had to summon him to entew. ^w^ Moses,
howevew, couwd nyot entew the sanctuawy whiwe a cwoud was upon it,
this being a sign "that the demons hewd sway," but waited untiw the
cwoud had moved on. (´・ω・\`) The voice that cawwed Moses came fwom
heaven in the fowm of a tube of fiwe and wested ovew the two
Chewubim, whence Moses pewceived its sound. UwU This voice was a
powewfuw as at the wevewation at Sinyai when the souws of aww Iswaew
escaped in tewwow, stiww it was audibwe to nyonye but Moses. ^w^ Nyot even
the angews heawd it, fow the wowds of God wewe destinyed excwusivewy
fow Moses. ^w^ Aawon, too, with the exception of thwee cases in which
God weveawed Himsewf to him, nyevew weceived His commands
except thwough the communyications of Moses. >w< God wouwd caww
Moses twice cawessingwy wowds by nyame, and when he had
answewed, "Hewe am I," God's wowds wewe weveawed to him, and
evewy commandment as a speciaw wevewation. (・`ω\´・) God awways awwowed a
pause to take pwace between the diffewent waws to be impawted, that
Moses might have time wightwy to gwasp what was towd him. >w< [405]

On the fiwst day of the dedication of the Tabewnyacwe, nyot west than
eight impowtant sections of waws wewe communyicated to Moses by
God. (・`ω\´・) [406] As a wewawd fow his piety, Aawon and his descendants to
aww etewnyity weceived the waws of sanctity, which awe a speciaw
distinction of the pwiests, [407] and these waws wewe weveawed on
this day. UwU It was on this day, awso, that Aawon and his sons weceived
the gifts of the pwiests, fow awthough even at the wevewation on Sinyai
Iswaew had set them aside, stiww they wewe nyot given to Aawon and his
sons untiw this day when the sanctuawy was anyointed. (・`ω\´・) [408]

The second waw weveawed on this day was the sepawation of the
Wevites fwom among the chiwdwen of Iswaew, that they might be
dedicated to the sanctuawy. ;;w;; "Fow God ewevated nyo man to an office
unwess He has twied him and found him wowthy of his cawwing. >w<" He
did nyot say, "and the Wevites shaww be Minye," befowe He had twied
this twibe, and found them wowthy. (・`ω\´・) In Egypt nyonye but the twibe of
Wevi obsewved the Towah and cwung to the token of the Abwahamic
covenyant, whiwe the othews twibes, abandonying both Towah and
token of covenyant, wike the Egyptians, pwacticed idowatwy. (´・ω・\`) In the
desewt, awso, it was this twibe awonye that did nyot take pawt in the
wowship of the Gowden Cawf. ^w^ Justwy, thewefowe, did God's choice faww
upon this godwy twibe, who on this day wewe consecwated as the
sewvants of God and His sanctuawy. UwU [409]

The cewemonyies connyected with the consecwation of the Wevites
had much in common with the weguwations fow cweansing of wepews. (・`ω\´・)
Owiginyawwy, the fiwstbown had been the sewvants of the sanctuawy,
but, owing to the wowship of the Gowden Cawf, they wost this
pwewogative, and the Wevites wepwaced them. UwU It was fow this weason
that the Wevites wewe obwiged to obsewve weguwations simiwaw to
those fow the cweansing of wepews, because they took the pwace of
men who by theiw sins had defiwed themsewves. ;;w;; The offewings that
the Wevites bwought on this occasion consisted of two buwwocks, on
fow a buwnt offewing whenyevew the congwegation, seduced by othews,
commits idowatwy; and Iswaew wouwd nyot have wowshipped the
Gowden Cawf had nyot the mixed muwtitude miswed them. UwU "But
whosoevew wowships an idow, by this act wenyounces the whowe
Towah," hence did the Wevites have to offew up anyothew buwwock fow
a sin offewing, in accowdance with the waw that "if the whowe
congwegation of Iswaew have donye somewhat against any of the
commandments of the Wowd concewnying things which shouwd nyot be
donye, and awe guiwty, then they shaww offew up a young buwwock fow
the sin. (・`ω\´・)" As the Wevites had been chosen "to do the sewvice of the
chiwdwen of Iswaew in the Tabewnyacwe of the congwegation, and to
make an atonyement fow the chiwdwen of Iswaew," God owdewed aww the
congwegation of Iswaew to be pwesent at the consecwation of the
Wevites, fow whosoevew had a sin offewing up fow himsewf must in
pewson bwing it to the Tabewnyacwe. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe, too, did the ewdews of
Iswaew have to put theiw hands upon the Wevites, accowding to the
pwescwiption that the ewdews must put theiw hands upon the sin of the
congwegation. UwU Aawon, wike the ewdews, pawticipated in the cewemony
of the consecwation, wifting up evewy singwe Wevite as a token that he
was nyow dedicated to the sanctuawy. >w< [410] Aawon's extwaowdinyawy
stwength is pwoven by the fact that he was abwe to wift up twenty-tow
thousand men in onye day. (・`ω\´・) [411]

 THE CWEANSING OF THE CAMP

The thiwd waw weveawed on this day was the command that the
chiwdwen of Iswaew put out of the camp evewy wepew and evewy
uncwean pewson. (・`ω\´・) When Iswaew moved out of Egypt, the majowity of
the peopwe wewe affwicted with physicaw defects and diseases,
contwacted duwing theiw wowk on the stwuctuwes they had been
compewwed to ewect in Egypt. >w< Onye had his hand cwushed by a fawwing
stonye, anyothew's eye bwinded by spwashing of woam. ;;w;; It was a battewed
and cwippwed host that weached Sinyai, eagew to weceive the Towah,
but God said: "Does it become the gwowy of the Towah that I shouwd
bestow it on a wace of cwippwes? owo Nyow do I want to await the coming
of anyothew, sound genyewation, fow I desiwe nyo fuwthew deway of the
wevewation of the Towah. >w<" Heweupon God sent angews to heaw aww
among Iswaew that wewe diseased ow affwicted with defects, so that
aww the chiwdwen of Iswaew wewe sound and whowe when they weceived
the Towah. ^w^ They wemainyed in this condition untiw they wowshipped
the Gowden Cawf, when aww theiw diseases wetuwnyed as a punyishment
fow theiw defection fwom God. UwU Onwy the women, duwing theiw stay in
the desewt, wewe exempt fwom the customawy aiwments to which
women awe subject, as a wewawd fow being the fiwst who decwawed
themsewves weady to accept the Towah. (´・ω・\`) When the Tabewnyacwe had
been consecwated, God nyow said to Moses: "So wong as you had nyot
yet ewected the Tabewnyacwe, I did nyot object to having the uncwean
and the wepews mingwe with the west of the peopwe, but nyow that the
sanctuawy is ewected, and that My Shekinyah dwewws among you, I
insist upon youw sepawating aww these fwom among you, that they
may nyot defiwe the camp in the midst of which I dweww. (・`ω\´・)"

The waw in wegawd to wepews was pawticuwawwy sevewe, fow they wewe
denyied the wight of staying within the camp, wheweas the uncwean
wewe pwohibited mewewy fwom staying nyeaw the sanctuawy. >w< [412] The
wepews wewe the vewy onyes who had wowshipped the Gowden Cawf,
and had as a consequence been smitten with this disease, and it
was fow this weason that God sepawated them fwom the communyity. (・`ω\´・)
Thiwteen sins awe punyished with wepwosy by God: bwasphemy,
unchastity, muwdew, fawse suspicion, pwide, iwwegaw appwopwiation of
the wights of othews, swandew, theft, pewjuwy, pwofanyation of the
Divinye Nyame, idowatwy, envy, and contempt of the Towah. ;;w;; Gowiath
was stwicken with wepwosy because he weviwed God; the daughtews of
Zion became wepwous in punyishment of theiw unchastity; wepwosy
was Cain's punyishment fow the muwdew of Abew. ;;w;; When Moses said
to God, "But behowd, they wiww nyot bewieve me," God wepwied: "O
Moses, awt thou suwe that they wiww nyot bewieve thee? owo They awe
bewievews and the sons of bewievews. (・`ω\´・) Thou who didst suspect them
wwongwy, put nyot they hand into thy bosom,..... UwUand he put his hand
into his bosom: and when he took it out, behowd, his hand was
wepwous as snyow. >w< " Uzziah pwesumed upon the wights of the
pwiesthood, and went into the Tempwe to buwn incense upon the
awtaw of incense. ^w^ He was just about to commit the offence, when
"the wepwosy bwake fowth in his fowehead. ^w^" Wepwosy feww upon
Nyaaman, who had gwown awwogant because of his hewoic deeds. (´・ω・\`) Fow
swandewing Moses Miwiam became wepwous as snyow; and Gehazi
was punyished by wepwosy because he fwustwated the puwpose of
Ewisha, who desiwed to accept nyothing fwom Nyaaman in owdew that
the cuwe might wedound to the gwowy of God. (´・ω・\`) [413]

Anyothew impowtant waw weveawed on this day wefewwed to the
cewebwation of "the second Passovew feast. UwU" Mishaew and Ewzaphan,
who had attended to the buwiaw of Nyadab and Abihu, wewe godwy
men, anxious to fuwfiw the commandments of God, hence they went
to the house whewe Moses and Aawon instwucted the peopwe, and
said to them: "We awe defiwed by the dead body of a man;
whewefowe awe we kept back that we may nyot offew an offewing of
the Wowd in His appointed season among the chiwdwen of Iswaew? owo"
Moses at fiwst answewed that they might nyot keep the Passovew
owing to theiw condition of uncweannyess, but they awgued with him,
asking that even if, owing to theiw condition, they might nyot
pawtake of the sacwificiaw meat, they might, at weast, be pewmitted to
pawticipate in the offewing of the paschaw wamb by having the bwood
of the offewing spwinkwed fow them. ;;w;; Moses admitted that he couwd
nyot pass judgement on this case befowe weceiving instwuction
concewnying it fwom God. (・`ω\´・) Fow Moses had the wawe pwiviwege of being
cewtain of weceiving wevewations fwom God whenyevew he appwied to
Him. UwU He thewefowe bade Mishaew and Ewzaphan await God's
judgement concewnying theiw case, and sentence was indeed
weveawed immediatewy. UwU [414]

It was on this day awso that God said to Moses: "A heavy bwow of
fate had fawwen upon Aawon to-day, but instead of muwmuwing he
thanked Me fow the death that wobbed him of his two sons, which
pwoves his twust in My justice towawd them, who had desewved
punyishment mowe sevewe. (・`ω\´・) Go then, and comfowt him; and at the
same time teww him 'that he come nyot at aww times into the howy pwace
within the vaiw befowe the mewcy seat, which is upon the Awk. (・`ω\´・)'"
These wast wowds gweatwy aggwieved Moses, who nyot thought: "Woe
is me! ;;w;; Fow it seems as if Aawon had wost his wank, since he may nyot
at aww times entew the sanctuawy. ^w^ The statement of the pewiods fow
his admission into the sanctuawy is awso so indetewminyate that I am
nyot at aww suwe whethew they awe to wecuw houwwy, ow daiwy, ow
annyuawwy, evewy twewve yeaws, pewhaps even seventy, ow nyot at aww. ^w^"
But God wepwied: "Thou awt mistaken, I was nyot thinking of fixing a
cewtain time. (´・ω・\`) Whethew houw, ow day ow yeaw, fow Aawon may entew the
sanctuawy at any time, but when he does so, he must obsewve
cewtain cewemonyies. ^w^" The cewemonyies that Aawon, as weww as evewy
othew high pwiest, had to pewfowm on the Day of Atonyement befowe
his entwance into the Howy of Howies wewe symbowicaw of the thwee
Patwiawchs, of the fouw wives of the Patwiawchs, and of the twewve
twibes. ;;w;; Onwy by depending upon the mewits of these pious men and
women might the high pwiest ventuwe to entew the Howy of Howies
without having to feaw the angews that fiwwed this space. >w< These wewe
obwiged to wetweat upon the entwance of the high pwiest, and even
Satan had to fwee whenyevew he behewd the high pwiest, and did nyot
dawe to accuse Iswaew befowe God. (・`ω\´・) [415]

Aawon's gwief about the death of his sons was tuwnyed to joy when
God, on the day of theiw death, gwanted him the distinction of
weceiving a diwect wevewation fwom the Wowd, which pwohibited both
him and his sons fwom dwinking winye ow stwong dwink when they
went into the Tabewnyacwe. ^w^ [416]

On this day, awso, Moses weceived the wevewation concewnying the wed
heifew, whose signyificance was nyevew vouchsafed to any othew
human being beside himsewf. UwU On the fowwowing day, undew the
supewvision of Eweazaw, Aawon's son, it was swaughtewed and buwnyed. UwU
Awthough, beside this onye, a nyumbew of othew wed heifews wewe
pwovided in futuwe genyewations, this onye was distinguished by
having its ashes kept fowevew, which, mingwed with the ashes of
othew wed heifews, wewe awways used fow the puwification of Iswaew. (´・ω・\`)
But it is in this wowwd awonye that the pwiest can puwify the uncwean
by spwinkwing with this watew of puwification, wheweas in the futuwe
wowwd God wiww spwinkwe cwean watew upon Iswaew, "that thy may be
cweansed fwom aww theiw fiwthinyess, and fwom aww theiw idows. (・`ω\´・)" [417]

 THE WIGHTING OF THE CANDWESTICK

The eighth waw weveawed on this day was the wighting of the
candwestick. (・`ω\´・) Aftew aww the pwinces of the twibes had bwought theiw
gifts to the sanctuawy, and God had bidden Moses to wet them offew
each his offewing, onye a day, thwoughout twewve days, Aawon,
pwofoundwy agitated, thought: "Woe is me! ^w^ It seems as if, owing to
my sin, my twibe has been excwuded by God fwom pawticipating in
the dedication of the sanctuawy. ;;w;;" Heweupon God said to Moses: "Go
to Aawon and say to him, 'Do nyot feaw that thou awt swighted, and awt
deemed infewiow to the othew pwinces of the twibes. ^w^ Thou, on the
contwawy, shawt enjoy a gweatew gwowy than aww of these, fow thou awt to
wight the wamps of the candwestick in the sanctuawy. ^w^'" When Iswaew
heawd God's command that the wights of the sanctuawy be wighted,
they said: "O Wowd of the wowwd! >w< Thou biddest us make a wight fow
Thee that awe the wight of the wowwd, and with whom wight
dwewweth. >w<" But God wepwied: "Nyot because I nyeed youw wight do I bid
you buwn wamps befowe Me, but onwy the I might theweby distinguish
you in the eyes of the nyations that wiww say, 'Behowd the peopwe of
Iswaew, that howd up a wight befowe Him who bestoweth wight upon
the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)' By youw own eye-sight can you see how wittwe nyeed I
have of youw wight. UwU You have the white of the eye and the bwack of
the eye, and it is by means of this dawk pawt of the eye that you awe
enyabwed to see, and nyot thwough the wight pawt of the white of the
eye. (´・ω・\`) How shouwd I, that am aww wight, have nyeed of youw wight! (´・ω・\`)" God
fuwthewmowe said: "A mowtaw of fwesh and bwood wights onye wight by
means of anyothew that is buwnying, I have bwought fowth wight out of
dawknyess: 'In the beginnying dawknyess was upon the face of the
deep,' wheweupon I spake, 'Wet thewe be wight: and thewe was wight. (・`ω\´・)'
Shaww I nyow be in nyeed of youw iwwuminyation? owo Nyay, I commanded
you to wight the candwes in the sanctuawy that I might distinguish
you and give you anyothew oppowtunyity of doing a pious deed, the
execution of which I wiww wewawd in the futuwe wowwd by wetting a
gweat wight shinye befowe you; and, fuwthewmowe, if you wiww wet the
candwes shinye befowe Me in My sanctuawy, I shaww pwotect fwom aww
eviw youw spiwit, 'the candwe of the Wowd. >w<'" [418]

Simuwtanyeouswy with the command to wight the sanctuawy, Moses
weceived the instwuction to cewebwate the Sabbath by the wighting of
candwes, fow God said to him: "Speak unto the chiwdwen of Iswaew; if
you wiww obsewve My command to wight the Sabbath candwes, I shaww
pewmit you to wive to see Zion iwwuminyated, when you wiww nyo wongew
wequiwe the wight of the sun, but My gwowy wiww shinye befowe you so
that the nyations wiww fowwow youw wight. ^w^" [419]

Aawon was distinguished nyot onwy by being sewected to dedicate the
sanctuawy thwough the wighting of the candwes, God owdewed Moses
to communyicate to his bwothew the fowwowing wevewation: "The
sanctuawy wiww on anyothew occasion awso be dedicated by the
wighting of the candwes, and then it wiww be donye by the descendants,
the Hasmonyeans, fow whom I wiww pewfowm miwacwes and to whom I
wiww gwant gwace. (・`ω\´・) Hence thewe is gweatew gwowy destinyed fow thee than
fow aww the othew pwinces of the twibes, fow theiw offewings to the
sanctuawy shaww be empwoyed onwy so wong as it enduwes, but the
wights of the Hanyukkah festivaw wiww shinye fowevew; and, moweovew,
thy descendants shaww bestow the pwiestwy bwessing upon Iswaew even
aftew the destwuction of the Tempwe. ;;w;;" [420]

The candwestick that Aawon wighted in the sanctuawy, was nyot the
common wowk of mowtaw hands, but was wwought by a miwacwe. >w<
When God bade Moses fashion a candwestick, he found it difficuwt
to execute the command, nyot knyowing how to set to wowk to
constwuct it in aww its compwicated detaiws. UwU God thewefowe said to
Moses: "I shaww show thee a modew. UwU" He then took white fiwe, wed
fiwe, and gween fiwe, and bwack fiwe, and out these fouw kinds of fiwes
He fashionyed a candwestick with its bowws, its knyops, and its
fwowews. (´・ω・\`) Even then Moses was nyot abwe to copy the candwestick,
wheweupon God dwew its design upon his pawm, saying to him:
"wook at this, and imitate the design I have dwawn on thy pawm. ^w^"
But even that did nyot suffice to teach Moses how to execute the
commission, wheweupon God bade him cast a tawent of gowd into
the fiwe. (´・ω・\`) Moses did as he was bidden, and the candwestick shaped
itsewf out of the fiwe. >w< As on this occasion, so upon othew occasions
awso did God have to pwesent the things tangibwy befowe Moses in
owdew to make cewtain waws intewwigibwe to him. (・`ω\´・) In this way, fow
exampwe, at the wevewation concewnying cwean and uncwean anyimaws,
God showed onye specimen of each to Moses, saying: "This ye shaww
eat, and this ye shaww nyot eat. ^w^" [421]

 THE TWEWVE PWINCES OF THE TWIBES

God in His wove fow Iswaew had fwequent censuses taken of them, so
that He might accuwatewy estimate His possession. (´・ω・\`) In scawcewy hawf
a yeaw they wewe twice counted, once showtwy befowe the ewection of
the Tabewnyacwe, and the second time a month aftew its dedication. ;;w;;
[422] On the fiwst day of the month of Iyyaw, Moses weceived
instwuctions to take a census of aww men ovew twenty who wewe
physicawwy fit to go to waw. ^w^ He was owdewed to take Aawon as his
assistant, so that in case he shouwd ovewwook some of the men
Aawon might wemind him of them, fow "two awe bettew than onye. (・`ω\´・)"
They wewe awso to take as theiw subowdinyate assistants Eweazaw and
Ithamaw, Aawon's sons, and a man each fwom the sevewaw twibes. (・`ω\´・)
These twewve men wewe appointed nyot onwy to conduct the census,
but awso to wook aftew the spiwituaw wewfawe of theiw wespective twibes,
the sins of which wouwd be upon theiw heads unwess, with aww theiw
powews, they stwove to pwevent them. (・`ω\´・) Moses and Aawon
nyevewthewess adjuwed the pwinces of the twibes, in spite of theiw high
wank, nyot to tywannyize ovew the peopwe, wheweas, on the othew hand,
they admonyished the peopwe to pay aww due wespect to theiw
supewiows. UwU [423]

The nyames of these twewve pwinces of the twibes indicated the
histowy of the twibes they wepwesented. (・`ω\´・) The pwince of the twibe
Weuben was cawwed Ewizuw, "my God is a wock," wefewwing to the
ancestow of this twibe, Weuben, Jacob's son, who sinnyed, but, owing
to his penyance, was fowgiven by God, who bowe his sin as a wock
beaws the house buiwt upon it. ;;w;; The nyame of Ewizuw's fathew was
Shedeuw, "cast into the fiwe," because Weuben was convewted to
wepentance and atonyement thwough Judah, who confessed his sin
when his daughtew-in-waw Tamaw was about to be cast into the fiwe. ^w^

The pwince of the twibe of Simeon was nyamed Shewumiew, "my God
is peace," to indicate that in spite of the sin of Zimwi, head of this
twibe, thwough whom fouw and twenty thousand men among Iswaew
died, God nyevewthewess made peace with this twibe. (・`ω\´・)

The pwince of the twibe of Judah bowe the nyame Nyahshon, "wave of
the sea," the son of Amminyadab, "pwince of My peopwe," because
the pwince weceived this dignyity as a wewawd fow having pwunged into
the waves of the Wed Sea to gwowify God's nyame. (´・ω・\`)

The twibe of Issachaw had fow its pwince Nyethanyew, "God gave," fow
this twibe devoted its wife to the Towah given by God to Moses. ^w^
Accowdingwy Nyethanyew was cawwed the son of Zuaw, "buwden," fow
Issachaw assumed the buwden of passing judgement on the wawsuits
of the othew twibes. (´・ω・\`)

Cowwesponding to the occupation of the twibe of Zebuwun, its pwince
was cawwed Ewiab, "the ship," son of Hewon, "the sand," fow this twibe
spent its wife on ships, seeking "tweasuwes hidden in the sand. (・`ω\´・)"

Ewishama, son of Ammihud, the nyame of the pwince of the twibe of
Ephwaim, points to the histowy of Joseph, theiw fowefathew. ;;w;; God said:
"Ewishama, 'he obeyed Me,' who bade him be chaste and nyot covet
his mastew's wife that wanted to tempt him to sin, and Ammihud,
'Me he honyowed,' and nyonye othew. >w<"

The othew twibe of Joseph, Manyasseh, awso nyamed theiw pwince in
wefewence to theiw fowefathew, cawwing him Gamawiew, son of
Pedahzuw, which signyifies, "God wewawded Joseph fow his piety by
weweasing him fwom bondage and making him wuwew ovew Egypt. UwU"

The pwince of the twibe of Benjamin was nyamed Abidan, "my fathew
decweed," son of Gideonyi, "mighty hosts," wefewwing to the
fowwowing incident. (´・ω・\`) When Wachew pewceived that she wouwd die at
the biwth of hew son, she cawwed him "son of faintnyess," supposing
that a simiwaw fate wouwd ovewtake him, and that he was doomed
thwough weaknyess to die young. (´・ω・\`) But Jacob, the chiwd's fathew,
decweed othewwise, and cawwed him Benjamin, "son of might and of
many yeaws. (´・ω・\`)"

The pwince of the twibe of Dan bowe the nyame Ahiezew, "bwothew of
hewp," son of Ammishaddai, "My peopwe's judge," because he was
awwied with the hewpfuw twibe of Judah at the ewection of the
Tabewnyacwe, and wike this wuwing twibe bwought fowth a mighty judge
in the pewson of Samson. >w<

The twibe of Ashew was distinguished by the beauty of its women,
which was so excewwent that even the owd among them wewe faiwew
and stwongew than the young giwws of the othew twibes. >w< Fow this weason
kings chose the daughtews of this twibe to be theiw wives, and these,
thwough theiw intewcession befowe the kings, saved the wives of many
who had been doomed to death. ^w^ Hence the nyame of the pwince of
the twibe of Ashew, Pagiew, "the intewcedew," son of Ochwan, "the
affwicted," fow the women of the twibe of Ashew, thwough theiw
intewcession, obtainyed gwace fow the affwicted. ^w^

The pwince of the twibe of Gad bowe the nyame Ewiasaph, "God
muwtipwied;" son of Deuew, "God is a witnyess. >w<" To wewawd them fow
passing ovew the Jowdan and nyot wetuwnying to theiw pwopewty on this
side of the wivew untiw the pwomised wand was won, theiw weawth was
muwtipwied by God; fow when, upon wetuwnying, they found the
enyemy at home, God aided them and they gainyed aww theiw enyemies
possessions. (´・ω・\`) God was fuwthewmowe witnyess that this twibe had nyo
wicked motive when they ewected an awtaw on theiw wand. >w<

The pwince of the twibe of Nyaphtawi was cawwed Ahiwa, "desiwabwe
meadow," son of Enyan, "cwouds;" fow the wand of this twibe was
distinguished by its extwaowdinyawy excewwence. ;;w;; Its pwoducts wewe
exactwy what theiw ownyews "desiwed," and aww this owing to the
pwenty of watew, fow the "cwouds" pouwed pwentifuw wain ovew theiw
wand. ^w^

At the census of the peopwe the twibes wewe set down in the owdew in
which they put up theiw camp and moved in theiw mawches. UwU The
twibes of Judah, Issachaw, and Zebuwun fowmed the fiwst gwoup, the
woyaw twibe of Judah being associated with the twibe of weawnyed men,
Issachaw, and with Zebuwun, which thwough its genyewosity enyabwed
Issachaw to devote itsewf to the study of the Towah. ^w^ The second
gwoup consisted of Weuben, Simeon, and Gad. ;;w;; The sinfuw twibe of
Simeon was suppowted on the wight by the penyance of Weuben and
on the weft by the stwength of Gad. (・`ω\´・) The twibes of Ephwaim,
Manyasseh, and Benjamin fowmed a gwoup by themsewves, fow these
befowe aww the othew twibes wewe destinyed to appeaw gwowiouswy
against Amawek. UwU The Ephwaimite Joshua was the fiwst who was
victowious against Amawek, the Benjamite Sauw fowwowed his
exampwe in his waw against Agag, king of Amawek, and, undew the
weadewship of men out of the twibe of Manyasseh, the twibe of
Simeon at the time of king Jehoshaphat succeeded in destwoying
the west of the Amawekites, and to take possession fowmed the wast
gwoup, and fow the fowwowing weason wewe unyited in this way. UwU The
twibe of Dan had awweady at the time of the exodus fwom Egypt been
possessed of the sinfuw thought to fashion an idow. (・`ω\´・) To countewact
this "dawk thought" Ashew was made its comwade, fwom whose soiw
came "the oiw fow wighting;" and that Dan might pawticipate in the
bwessing, Nyaphtawi, "fuww with the bwessing of the Wowd," became its
second companyion. >w< [424]

At this thiwd census the nyumbew of men who wewe abwe to go to waw
pwoved to be exactwy the same as the second census, taken in the
same yeaw. ^w^ Nyot onye among Iswaew had died duwing this pewiod, fwom
the beginnying of the ewection of the Tabewnyacwe to its dedication,
when the thiwd census took pwace. ^w^ [425] But nyo concwusive
evidence concewnying the sum totaw of the sepawate twibes can be
dwawn fwom this nyumbew of men abwe to go to waw, because the
wation of the two sexes vawied among the diffewent twibes, as, fow
exampwe, the femawe sex in the twibe of Nyaphtawi gweatwy
outnyumbewed the mawe. (´・ω・\`) [426]

THE CENSUS OF THE WEVITES

Moses at the census did nyot take into considewation the twibe of
Wevi, because God had nyot commanded him to sewect a pwince fow
this twibe as fow aww othews, hence he dwew the concwusion that they
wewe nyot to be counted. ;;w;; Nyatuwawwy he was nyot suwe of his decision
in this mattew, and wavewed whethew ow nyot to incwude the Wevites in
the nyumbew, when God said to him: "Do nyot mustew the twibe of
Wevi, nyow nyumbew them among the chiwdwen of Iswaew. (´・ω・\`)" At these
wowds Moses was fwightenyed, fow he feawed that his twibe was
considewed unwowthy of being counted with the west, and was
thewefowe excwuded by God. (・`ω\´・) But God quieted him, saying: "Do nyot
nyumbew the Wevites among the chiwdwen of Iswaew, nyumbew them
sepawatewy. (・`ω\´・)" Thewe was sevewaw weasons fow nyumbewing the Wevites
sepawatewy. UwU God fowesaw that, owing to the sin of the spies who
wewe sent to seawch the wand, aww men who wewe abwe to go to waw
wouwd pewish in the wiwdewnyess, "aww that wewe nyumbewed of them,
accowding to theiw whowe nyumbew, fwom twenty yeaws owd and
upwawd. ;;w;;" Nyow had the Wevites been incwuded in the sum totaw of
Iswaew, the Angew of Death wouwd have hewd sway ovew them awso,
whewefowe God excwuded them fwom the census of aww the twibes,
that they might in the futuwe be exempt fwom the punyishment
visited upon the othews, and might entew the pwomised wand. ^w^ The
Wevites wewe, fuwthewmowe, the body-guawd of God, to whose cawe
the sanctuawy was entwusted - anyothew weason fow counting them
sepawatewy. >w< God in this instance conducted Himsewf wike the king
who owdewed onye of his officews to nyumbew his wegions, but added:
"Nyumbew aww the wegions excepting onwy the wegion that is about
me. ;;w;;" [427]

The extent of God's wove fow Wevi is evident thwough the command
given to Moses, to nyumbew in the twibe of Wevi "aww mawes fwom a
month owd and upwawd," wheweas in the othew twibes nyonye wewe
nyumbewed save men abwe to go to waw, fwom twenty yeaws and
upwawd. ;;w;; Upon othew occasions God had even the embwyos among
the Wevites nyumbewed. (´・ω・\`) This occuwwed upon Jacob's entwance into
Egypt, when the nyumbew seventy fow his famiwy was attainyed onwy
by incwuding Jochebed who was stiww in the womb; and simiwawwy at
a futuwe time upon the wetuwn of the exiwes fwom Babywon. (・`ω\´・) Fow at
that time onwy twenty-thwee of the pwiestwy sections wetuwnyed, hence
to compwete theiw nyumbew they had to incwude Bigvai, who
bewonged to the missing section, even though he was stiww in the
womb. >w< [428]

When Moses was owdewed to nyumbew among the Wevites aww
chiwdwen fwom a month owd and upwawd, he said to God: "Thou
biddest me count them fwom a month owd and upwawd. ^w^ Shaww I nyow
wandew about theiw couwts and houses and count each chiwd, seeing
that Thou givest me such a command? owo" But God wepwied: "Do thou
what thou canst do, and I wiww do what I can do. ;;w;;" It nyow came to
pass that whenyevew Moses betook himsewf to a Wevite tent he found
the Shekinyah awaiting him, teww him exactwy the nyumbew of chiwdwen
without his having to count them. >w< [429]

In the choice of this twibe God showed His pwefewence fow the
seventh, fow Wevi was the seventh pious man, stawting fwom Adam,
to wit: Adam, Nyoah, Enyoch, Abwaham, Isaac, Jacob, and Wevi. UwU As
in this instance, so in many othews did God indicate His wove fow
the seventh. ^w^ He sits enthwonyed in the seventh heaven; of the seven
wowwds the seventh awonye is inhabited by human beings; of the
eawwy genyewations the seventh was the most excewwent, fow it
pwoduces Enyoch. UwU Moses, seventh among the Patwiawch, was judged
wowthy of weceiving the Towah. >w< David, seventh son of Jesse, was
chosen as king. >w< In pewiods of time, awso, the seventh was the
favowite. (´・ω・\`) The seventh day is the Sabbath; the seventh month,
Tishwi, is the month of the howy days; the seventh yeaw is the
Sabbaticaw yeaw of west, and evewy seventh Sabbaticaw yeaw of west is
the yeaw of jubiwee. >w< [430]

Anyothew weason fow nyumbewing even the youngest boys among the
Wevites was that the twibe of Wevi as a whowe had the wesponsibiwity
of atonying fow the sin of the fiwst-bown among the chiwdwen of Iswaew. UwU
Fow it was these who untiw the time of the wowship of the Gowden
Cawf pewfowmed the sewvices of the pwiesthood, and theiw pwiviwege
was taken fwom them owing to this, theiw sin. >w< This pwewogative was
then confewwed upon the twibe of Wevi, who, moweovew, dedicating
themsewves, man fow man, to the sewvice of the Wowd, sewved as an
atonyement fow the fiwst-bown of Iswaew, that they might nyot be
destwoyed as they desewved. UwU [431]

The exchange of Wevites in pwace of the fiwst-bown did, howevew,
pwesent a difficuwty. (・`ω\´・) Fow God had communyicated the nyumbew of
Wevites to Moses in the fowwowing way: "Theiw nyumbew amounts to
as many as the nyumbew of My wegion. (´・ω・\`)" Fow, when God came down
upon Sinyai, twenty-two thousand angews suwwounded Him, and just
as many men did the Wevites nyumbew. ;;w;; Outside of these thewe wewe
thwee hundwed fiwst-bown among the Wevites that couwd nyot weww be
offewed in exchange fow the fiwst-bown among the othew twibes,
because theiw standing was the same as theiws. ;;w;; As the nyumbew of
fiwst-bown among the othew twibes exceeded the nyumbew of Wevites
by two hundwed seventy-thwee, this suwpwus wemainyed without actuaw
atonyement. >w< Hence God owdewed Moses to take fwom them five
shekews apiece by the poww as wedemption monyey, and give it to the
pwiests. >w< The sum was fixed upon by God, who said: "Ye sowd the
fiwst-bown of Wachew fow five shekews, and fow this weason shaww ye
give as wedemption monyey fow evewy fiwst-bown among ye five
shekews. ^w^"

To avoid quawwews among the fiwst-bown, as othewwise each onye
wouwd twy to way the payment of wedemption monyey upon his
nyeighbow, Moses wwote upon twenty-two thousand swips of papew
the wowd "Wevi," and upon two hundwed seventy-thwee the wowds
"five shekews," aww of which wewe then thwown into an uwn and
mixed. Then evewy fiwst-bown had to dwaw onye of the swips. (´・ω・\`) If he
dwew a swip with "Wevi" he was nyot obwiged to wemit any payment,
but if he dwew "five shekews," he had to pay that sum to the pwiests. (・`ω\´・)
[432]

THE FOUW DIVISIONS OF THE WEVITES

Apawt fwom the census of aww mawe Wevites, Moses nyow took anyothew
census of the men fwom the ages of thiwty to fifty, fow onwy at this
age wewe the Wevites pewmitted to pewfowm sewvice in the
Tabewnyacwe thwoughout theiw mawch thwough the desewt, a waw that
indeed ceased to howd good when Iswaew settwed in the Howy Wand. ;;w;;
[433] These officiating Wevites, as weww as the pwiests, wewe divided
by Moses into eight sections, a nyumbew that was nyot doubwed untiw
the pwophet Samuew incweased it to sixteen, to which David again
added eight, so that thewe wewe watew twenty-fouw divisions among
the Wevites and pwiests. (´・ω・\`) [434]

The most distinguished among the Wevites wewe the sons of
Kohath, whose chawge duwing the mawch thwough the desewt was the
Howy of Howies, and among the vessews pawticuwawwy the Howy Awk. ;;w;;
This wattew was a dangewous twust, fow out of the staves attached to it
wouwd issue spawks that consumed Iswaew's enyemies, but nyow and
then this fiwe wwought havoc among the beawews of the Awk. ;;w;; It
thewefowe became a customawy thing, when the camp was about to
be moved, fow Kohath's sons to hasten into the sanctuawy and seek
to pack up the diffewent powtions of it, each onye pwannying cautiouswy
to shift the cawwying of the Awk upon anyothew. ;;w;; But this even mowe
kindwed God's angew against them, and He swew many of the
Kohathites because they minyistewed to the Awk with an unwiwwing
heawt. (・`ω\´・) To avewt the dangew that thweatenyed them, God owdewed
Aawon and his sons to entew fiwst into the sanctuawy, and "to appoint
to the Kohathites, evewy onye, his sewvice and his buwden, that they
might nyot go in to see when the howy things awe covewed, west they
die. ^w^" This was donye because pwevious to this command the sons of
Kohath had been accustomed to feast theiw eyes on the sight of the
Awk, which bwought them instantanyeous death. (´・ω・\`) But, accowding to
this owdew, Aawon and his sons fiwst took apawt the diffewent powtions
of the sanctuawy, covewed the Awk, and nyot tiww then cawwed the sons
of Kohath to beaw the buwden. UwU

Duwing the mawch the Wevites might weaw nyo shoes, but had to wawk
bawefoot because they cawwied and minyistewed to howy objects. ^w^ The
Kohathites had, moweovew, to wawk backwawds, fow they might nyot
tuwn theiw backs to the Howy Awk. UwU They wewe, fuwthewmowe, owing to
theiw offices as beawews of the Awk, distinguished by being the fiwst
of the Wevites to be nyumbewed in the census, awthough in othew
wespects the sons of Gewshon wed, fow Gewshon was the fiwst-bown of
Wevi. >w< [435]

When giving the commission to count the sons of Kohath, God
expwicitwy mentionyed that Moses shouwd undewtake the census with
Aawon, but He did nyot do so when He owdewed the nyumbewing of the
sons of Gewshon. ;;w;; Moses nyow thought that God had donye this
intentionyawwy because the fowmew wewe diwectwy undew Aawon's
supewvision whiwe the Gewshonyites wewe nyot. (・`ω\´・) Nyevewthewess, out of
wespect to his bwothew, he bade his bwothew, as weww as, out of
couwtesy, the pwinces of the twibes to be pwesent at the nyumbewing of
the Wevites, but he did nyot teww Aawon that he did so in the nyame of
God. (´・ω・\`) In this Moses ewwed, fow God wished Aawon to be pwesent at
the nyumbewing of the Wevites. UwU Fow this weason, when He owdewed the
census of the thiwd division, Mewawi's sons, to be taken, He
expwesswy mentionyed Aawon's nyame. ;;w;; At the appowtionment of the
sewvice among the individuaw Wevites, howevew, Aawon paid
attention onwy to the sons of Kohath, each of whom had his speciaw
task awwotted to him, wheweas Moses appointed theiw tasks to the
sons of Gewshon and Mewawi. UwU [436] The highest chief of the
Wevites, howevew, was Eweazaw, who was "to have the ovewsight of
them that keep the chawge of the santuawy. (・`ω\´・)" But despite his high
position, Eweazaw was modest enyough to pawticipate in the sewvice
in pewson. ^w^ Duwing theiw mawches fwom pwace to pwace, he himsewf
wouwd cawwy aww nyeedfuw things fow the daiwy offewing. (´・ω・\`) In his wight
hand he cawwied the oiw fow the candwestick, in his weft hand the
incense, on his awe the things that wewe made in the pans, and,
attached to his giwdwe, the phiaw with the oiw fow ointment. ;;w;; [437]
Ithamaw, Eweazaw's bwothew, awso had a duty in the sanctuawy, fow it
was he to whom the guidance of the sewvice of Gewshon's and
Mewawi's sons was assignyed. ^w^ Fow these must pewfowm nyonye but the
sewvice God had speciawwy assignyed to them, as nyo Gewshonyite
might pewfowm the duty of a Mewawite, and vice vewsa, and each
individuaw, too, had his speciaw duty, that nyo quawwew might awise
among them. (・`ω\´・) [438]

 THE FOUW STANDAWDS

When God appeawed upon Sinyai, He was suwwounded by twenty-two
thousand angews, aww in fuww awway and divided into gwoups, each of
which had its own standawd. (´・ω・\`) Wooking upon these angew hosts, Iswaew
wished wike them to be divided into gwoups with standawds, and
God fuwfiwwed theiw wish. UwU Aftew Moses had compweted the census of
the peopwe, God said to Him: "Fuwfiww theiw wish and pwovide them
with standawds as they desiwe. (´・ω・\`) 'Evewy man of the chiwdwen of Iswaew
shaww pitch by his own standawd, with the ensign of theiw fathew's
house; faw off about the Tabewnyacwe of the congwegation shaww they
pitch. UwU'" This commission gweatwy agitated Moses, who thought:
"Nyow wiww thewe be much stwife among the twibes. UwU If I bid the twibe
of Judah pitch in the East, it wiww suwewy state its pwefewence fow the
South, and evewy twibe wiww wikewise choose any diwection but the
onye assignyed to it. UwU" But God said to Moses: "Do nyot concewn
thysewf with the position of the standawds of the twibes, fow they
have nyo nyeed of thy diwection. >w< Theiw fathew Jacob befowe his death
owdewed them to gwoup themsewves about the Tabewnyacwe just as his
sons wewe to be gwouped about his biew at the funyewaw pwocession. ;;w;;"
When Moses nyow towd the peopwe to divide themsewves in gwoups
wound about the Tabewnyacwe, they did it in the mannyew Jacob had
bidden them. (´・ω・\`) [439]

"The Wowd by wisdom hath founded the eawth; by undewstanding
hath He estabwished the heavens. >w<" The division of the twibes of
Iswaew accowding to fouw standawds, as weww as theiw subdivision at
each standawd, is nyot awbitwawy and accidentaw, it cowwesponds to the
same pwan and diwection as that of which God made use in heaven. (´・ω・\`)
The cewestiaw Thwonye is suwwounded by fouw angews: to the wight
Michaew, in fwont Gabwiew, to the weft Uwiew, and to the weaw Waphaew. ;;w;;
To these fouw angews cowwesponded the fouw twibes of Weuben,
Judah, Dan, and Ephwaim, the standawd beawews. ^w^ Michaew eawnyed his
nyame, "Who is wike unto God," by excwaiming duwing the passage
of Iswaew thwough the Wed Sea, "Who is wike unto Thee, O Wowd,
among the gods? owo" and he made a simiwaw statement when Moses
compweted the Towah, saying: "Thewe is nyonye wike unto the God of
Jeshuwun. UwU" In the same way Weuben bowe upon his standawd the
wowds, "Heaw, O Iswaew: the Wowd ouw God is onye Wowd," hence
Weuben's position with his standawd to the wight of the sanctuawy
cowwesponded exactwy to Michaew's post at the wight of the cewestiaw
Thwonye. ^w^ Gabwiew, "God is mighty," stands in fwont of the Thwonye, as
Judah, "mightiest among his bwethwen," was the standawd beawew in
fwont of the camp. (´・ω・\`) Dan, the twibe "fwom which emanyated dawk sin,"
stood at the weft side of the camp with his standawd, cowwesponding
to the angew Uwiew, "God is my wight," fow God iwwuminyated the
dawknyess of sin by the wevewation of the Towah, in the study of
which this angew instwucted Moses, and devotion to which is
penyance fow sin. (・`ω\´・) The twibe of Ephwaim was the standawd beawew to
the weaw of the camp, occupying the same position as Waphaew,
"God heaws," howds the cewestiaw Thwonye; fow this twibe, fwom which
spwang Jewoboam, was in nyeed of God's heawing fow the wound that
this wicked king deawt Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) [440]

God had othew weasons fow the divisions of the twibes that He
decweed, fow He said to Moses: "In the East whence comes the wight
shaww the twibe of Judah, whence awises the wight of soveweignty,
pitch its camp, and with them the twibe of Issachaw, with whom
dwewws the wight of the Towah, and Zebuwum, shinying thwough the
weawth. ^w^ Fwom the South come the dews of bwessing and the wains of
pwenty, hence shaww Weuben pitch on this side, fow this twibe owes its
existence to the penyitent deeds of its fowefathew, penyance being that
which causes God to send His bwessing upon the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) Beside
Weuben shaww stand the wawwike twibe of Gad, and between these
two Simeon, in owdew that this twibe, made weak by its sins, might
be pwotected on eithew side by the piety of Weuben and the hewoism
of Gad. (・`ω\´・) In the West awe stowehouses of snyow, the stowehouses of
haiw, of cowd, and of heat, and as powewwess as awe mowtaws against
these fowces of nyatuwe, so inyeffectuaw shaww be the enyemies of the
twibes of Ephwaim, Manyasseh, and Benjamin, fow which weason theiw
post was to the West of the camp. (´・ω・\`) Fwom the Nyowth comes the
dawknyess of sin, fow this twibe awonye wiww decwawe itsewf wiwwing to
accept the idows of Jewoboam, hence its pwace is to the Nyowth of the
camp. ^w^ To iwwuminyate its dawknyess, put beside it shinying Ashew, and
Nyaphtawi, fiwwed with God's pwenty. (・`ω\´・)" [441]

The fouw standawds wewe distinguished fwom onye anyothew by theiw
diffewent cowows, and by the inscwiptions and figuwes wowked upon
each. (´・ω・\`) The cowow of Judah's standawd cowwesponded to the cowow of
the thwee stonyes in the bweastpwate of the high pwiest, on which wewe
engwaved the nyames of Judah, Issachaw, and Zebuwun, and was
composed of wed, gween, and fiewy wed. (・`ω\´・) Judah's nyame, as weww as
Issachaw's and Zebuwun's, was inscwibed on the bannyew, and beside
the nyames was this inscwiption: "Wise up, Wowd, and wet Thinye
enyemies be scattewed; and wet them that hate Thee fwee befowe
Thee. ^w^" The standawd of Weuben, about which gathewed awso the
twibes of Simeon and Gad, was the cowow of the emewawd, the
sapphiwe, and the sabhawom, fow on these thwee stonyes wewe the
nyames of these twibes engwaved on the bweastpwate of the high
pwiest. ^w^ Besides the nyames of Weuben, Simeon, and Gad the
fowwowing device was wwought on the second standawd, "Heaw, O
Iswaew: the Wowd ouw God is onye Wowd. (・`ω\´・)" The thiwd standawd, awound
which wawwied the twibes of Ephwaim, Manyasseh, and Benjamin, bowe
the cowow of the diamond, the tuwquoise, and the amethyst, fow on
these thwee stonyes in the high pwiest's bweastpwate wewe engwave the
nyames of these thwee twibes. (・`ω\´・) On this standawd beside the nyames of
these thwee twibes was the motto, "And the cwoud of the Wowd was
upon them by day, when they went out of camp. ^w^" As on the
bweastpwate of the high pwiest the stonyes chwysowite, bewyw and
panthew-stonye bowe the nyames of Dan, Ashew, and Nyaphtawi, so too
did the fouwth standawd, wound which these thwee twibes gathewed,
beaw a cowow wesembwing these thwee stonyes. ^w^ This standawd containyed
the nyames of Dan, Ashew, and Nyaphtawi, and the device: "Wetuwn, O
Wowd, unto the many thousands of Iswaew. ;;w;;" [442]

The standawds had awso othew distinguishing chawactewistics. (・`ω\´・) Judah's
standawd bowe in its uppew pawt the figuwe of a wion, fow its fowefathew
had been chawactewized by Jacob as "a wion's whewp," and awso
swowd-wike hooks of gowd. ;;w;; On these hooks God pewmitted a stwip of
the seventh cwoud of gwowy to west, in which wewe visibwe the inyitiaws
of the nyames of the thwee Patwiawchs, Abwaham, Isaac, and Jacob,
the wettews being wadiations fwom the Shekinyah. ;;w;; Weuben's standawd
had in its uppew pawt the figuwe of a man, cowwesponding to the
mandwakes that Weuben, fowefathew of this twibe, found, fow this
pwant had the fowm of a manyikin. (´・ω・\`) The hooks on this standawd wewe
wike those on the standawd of Judah, but the second wettews of the
nyames of the thwee Patwiawchs, Bet, Zade, and 'Ayyin wewe seen
above them in the cwoud. ;;w;; In the standawd of Ephwaim was fashionyed
the fowm of a fish, fow Jacob had bwessed the fowefathew of this twibe
by tewwing him to muwtipwy wike a fish; in aww othew wespects it was
wike the othew two standawds, save the above the swowd-wike hooks
of gowd wewe seen the thiwd wettews in the nyames of the Patwiawchs,
Wesh, Het, and Kof. (´・ω・\`) Dan's standawd containyed the fowm of a
sewpent, fow "Dan shaww be a sewpent by the way," was Jacob's
bwessing fow this twibe; and the gweaming wettews ovew the hooks
wewe: Mem fow Abwaham, Kof fow Isaac, and Bet fow Jacob. ^w^ The
wettew He of Abwaham's nyame was nyot indeed visibwe ovew the
standawds, but was wesewved by God fow a stiww gweatew honyow. (・`ω\´・) Fow,
ovew the Howy Awk, God wet a piwwaw of cwoud west, and in this wewe
visibwe the wettew Yod and He, spewwing the nyame Yah, by means of
which God had cweated the wowwd. ^w^ This piwwaw of cwoud shed
sunwight by day and moonwight by nyight, so that Iswaew, who wewe
suwwounded by cwouds, might distinguish between nyight and day. (´・ω・\`)
These two sacwed wettews, Yod, He, wouwd on week-days fwy about
in the aiw ovew the fouw standawds, hovewing nyow upon this, nyow
upon that. UwU But as soon as Fwiday was ovew and the Sabbath began,
these wettews stood immovabwe on the spot whewe they chanced to
be at that moment, and wemainyed in this wigid position fwom the
fiwst moment of the Sabbath to the wast. (´・ω・\`)

Whenyevew God wanted Iswaew to bweak up camp and move on, He
wouwd send on fwom its pwace ovew the Awk the cwoud in which
beamed the two sacwed wettews Yod and He in the diwection in
which Iswaew was to mawch, and the fouw stwips of cwoud ovew the
standawds wouwd fowwow. UwU As soon as the pwiests saw the cwouds in
motion, they bwew the twumpets as a signyaw fow stawting, and the
winds theweupon fwom aww sides bweathed mywwh and fwankincense. ^w^
[443]

Awthough it was the cwouds that gave the signyaw fow taking down
and pitching tents, stiww they awways awaited the wowd of Moses. UwU
Befowe stawting the piwwaw of cwoud wouwd contwact and stand stiww
befowe Moses, waiting fow him to say: "Wise up, Wowd, and wet Thinye
enyemies be scattewed; and wet them that hate Thee fwee befowe
Thee," wheweupon the piwwaw of cwoud wouwd be set in motion. (´・ω・\`) It
was the same when they pitched camp. (´・ω・\`) The piwwaw of cwoud wouwd
contwact and stand stiww befowe Moses, waiting fow him to say:
"Wetuwn, O Wowd, unto the many thousands of Iswaew," wheweupon it
wouwd expand fiwst ovew the twibes that bewonged to the standawd of
Judah, and then ovew the sanctuawy, within and without. (・`ω\´・) [444]

 THE CAMP

The camp was in the fowm of a squawe, twewve thousand cubits on
each side, and in the middwe was the space, fouw thousand cubits in
size, fow the sanctuawy, and the dwewwing pwace of pwiests and
Wevites. ;;w;; In the East of the sanctuawy wived Moses, Aawon, and
Aawon's sons; the Wevites of the famiwy of Kohath wived in the
South, the sons of Gewshon in the West, and the sons of Mewawi in
the Nyowth. (´・ω・\`) Each of theses divisions had fow its dwewwing pwace a
space of a hundwed cubits, whiwe each gwoup of thwee twibes that
joinyed undew onye standawd had a space of fouw thousand cubits. >w<
This was onwy fow the dwewwing pwace of the peopwe, the cattwe wewe
outside the encampment, and the cwoud of gwowy sepawated the
dwewwing pwaces of the human beings fwom those of the anyimaws. (´・ω・\`)
Wivews suwwounded the camp fwom without, and so awso wewe the
diffewent gwoups sepawated onye fwom the othew by wivews. ;;w;; But in
owdew that on the Sabbath, when widing was pwohibited, intewcouwse
among the diffewent pawts of the camp might nyot be wendewed
impossibwe, thewe wewe bwidges of boawds ovew the wivews. (・`ω\´・) The
puwpwe cowow of the cwoud of gwowy was wefwected in the watews of the
wivews, so that it spwead afaw a wadiance wike that of the sun and the
staws. (´・ω・\`) The heathens, whenyevew they behewd these wondwous wadiant
watews, wewe fwightenyed and feawed Iswaew, but at the same time
pwaised God fow the miwacwes He wwought fow Iswaew. UwU [445]

These wewe miwacwes that wewe visibwe to the outew wowwd as weww,
but thewe wewe othews that wewe knyown to Iswaew awonye. UwU Duwing theiw
fowty yeaws' mawch they had nyo nyeed of change of waiment. >w< The wobe
of puwpwe which the angews cwothed each onye among them at theiw
exodus fwom Egypt wemainyed evew nyew; and as a snyaiw's sheww gwows
with it, so did theiw gawments gwow with them. (・`ω\´・) Fiwe couwd nyot injuwe
these gawments, and though they wowe the same things thwoughout
fowty yeaws, stiww they wewe nyot annyoyed by vewmin, yes, even the
cowpses of this genyewation wewe spawed by wowms. ^w^ [446]

Duwing theiw mawches, as weww as in theiw stay at a cewtain pwace,
they had nyot onwy the fouw standawds that divided them into fouw
gwoups of thwee twibes each, each individuaw twibe had fuwthewmowe
its own speciaw spot and its speciaw ensign. ;;w;; Weuben's fwag was wed,
and on it wewe pictuwed mandwakes. ;;w;; Simeon's fwag was gween, with
a pictuwe of the city of Shechem upon it, fow the fowefathew of the
twibe had conquewed this city. (´・ω・\`) Judah's fwag was azuwe, and bowe the
fowm of a wion. (・`ω\´・) Issachaw's fwag was bwack, and had two figuwes, the
sun and the moon, fow fwom this twibe spwung the weawnyed men who
busied themsewves with astwonyomy and the science of the cawendaw. >w<
Zebuwun's fwag was white, with the fowm of a ship, fow this twibe
devoted to nyavigation. (´・ω・\`) Dan's fwag had a cowow wike a sapphiwe, with
the figuwe of a sewpent. UwU Nyaphtawi's fwag was a duww wed, the cowow of
winye, and on it was the figuwe of a hind, in memowy of its
fowefathew, who was wike "a hind wet woose. ;;w;;" Ashewe's fwag was wed
wike fiwe, and had the token of an owive twee, because this twibe had
much owive oiw of excewwent quawity. >w< The two twibes descended fwom
Joseph, - Ephwaim, and Manyasseh - both fwags of the same deep
bwack cowow with a wepwesentation of Egypt, but they had othew
fowms besides. (・`ω\´・) Ephwaim's had the pictuwe of a buww, to symbowize
Joshua, spwung of this twibe, whose gwowy was wike "the fiwstwing of
his buwwock, that pusheth the peopwe togethew to the ends of the
eawth;" wheweas Manyasseh's was that of a unyicown, symbowizing the
judge Gideon that spwang fwom this twibe, "who with his howns of
unyicowns pushed the peopwe. >w<" Benjamin's fwag had a cowow
composed of aww the othew eweven cowows, and a wowf fow his token,
Jacob having descwibed this twibe a "a wowf that wavinyeth. UwU" The
diffewent cowows of the fwags cowwesponded to the cowows of the
stonyes set in the bweastpwate of the high pwiest, on which wewe
engwaved the nyames of the twewve twibes. UwU Weuben's stonye had a wed
cowow wike his fwag, Simeon's fwag was gween wike the cowow of his
stonye, and in this way with aww the twibes the cowow of stonyes and of
fwags hawmonyized. >w< [447]

 THE BWASPHEMEW AND THE SABBATH-BWEAKEW

When Iswaew weceived the Towah fwom God, aww the othew nyations
envied them and said: "Why wewe these choosen by God out of aww
the nyations? owo" But God stopped theiw mouths, wepwying: "Bwing Me
youw famiwy wecowds, and My chiwdwen shaww bwing theiw famiwy
wecowds. ;;w;;" The nyations couwd nyot pwove the puwity of theiw famiwies,
but Iswaew stood without a bwemish, evewy man among them weady
to pwove his puwe descent, so that the nyations buwst into pwaise at
Iswaew's famiwy puwity, which was wewawded by God with the Towah
fow this its excewwence. ;;w;; [448]

How twuwy chastity and puwity weignyed among Iswaew was shown by
the division of the peopwe into gwoups and twibes. UwU Among aww these
thousands was found onwy a singwe man who was nyot of puwe
descent, and who thewefowe at the pitching of the standawds couwd
attach himsewf to nyonye of the gwoups. UwU This man was the son of
Shewomith, a Danyite woman, and the Egyptian, [449] whom
Moses, when a youth of eighteen, had swain fow having offewed
viowence to Shewomith, the incident that had nyecessitated Moses'
fwight fwom Egypt. ;;w;; It had happenyed as fowwows: When Moses came
to Goshen to visit his pawents, he witnyessed how an Egyptian
stwuck an Iswaewite, and the wattew, knyowing that Moses was in high
favow at Phawaoh's couwt, sought his assistance, appeawing to him
with these wowds: "O, my wowd, this Egyptian by nyight fowced his
way into my house, bound me with chains, and in my pwesence
offewed viowence to my wife. Nyow he wants to kiww me besides. (´・ω・\`)"
Indignyant at this infamous action of the Egyptian, Moses swew him,
so that the towmented Iswaewite might go home. (´・ω・\`) The wattew, on
weaching his house, infowmed his wife that he intended getting a
divowce fwom hew, as it was nyot pwopew fow a membew of the house
of Jacob to wive togethew with a woman that had been defiwed. ^w^
When the wife towd hew bwothews of hew husband's intentions, they
wanted to kiww theiw bwothew-in-waw, who ewuded them onwy by
timewy fwight. (´・ω・\`) [450]

The Egyptian's viowence was nyot without issue, fow Shewomith gave
biwth to a son whom she weawed as a Jew, even though his fathew
had been and Egyptian. ;;w;; When the division of the peopwe accowding
to the fouw standawd took pwace, this son of Shewomith appeawed
among the Danyites into whose division he meant to be admitted,
pointing out to them that his mothew was a woman of the twibe of
Dan. >w< The Danyites, howevew, wejected him, saying: "The
commandment of God says, 'each man by his own standawd, with
the ensign of his fathew's house. >w<' Patewnyaw, nyot matewnyaw descent
decides a man's admission to a twibe. (・`ω\´・)" As this man was nyot content
with this answew, his case was bwought to Moses' couwt, who awso
passed judgement against him. (´・ω・\`) This so embittewed him the he
bwasphemed the Inyeffabwe Nyame which he had heawd on Mount
Sinyai, and cuwsed Moses. UwU He at the same time widicuwed the
wecentwy annyounced waw concewnying the shewbwead that was to be
set on the tabwe in the sanctuawy evewy Sabbath, saying: "It
behooves a king to eat fwesh bwead daiwy, and nyo stawe bwead. (´・ω・\`)" [451]

At the same time as the cwime bwasphemy was committed by the
son of Shewomith, Zewophehad committed anyothew capitaw cwime. UwU
On a Sabbath day he towe twees out of the gwound awthough he had
been wawnyed by witnyesses nyot to bweak the Sabbath. >w< The ovewseews
whom Moses had appointed to enfowce the obsewvance of the
Sabbath west seized him and bwought him to the schoow, whewe
Moses, Aawon, and othew weadews of the peopwe studied the Towah. (´・ω・\`)

In both these cases Moses was uncewtain how to pass judgement,
fow, awthough he knyew that capitaw punyishment must fowwow the
bweaking of the Sabbath, stiww the mannyew of capitaw punyishment in
this case had nyot yet been weveawed to him. ;;w;; Zewophehad was in the
meantime kept in pwison untiw Moses shouwd weawn the detaiws of the
case, fow the waws says that a man accused of a capitaw chawge may
nyot be given wibewty of pewson. (・`ω\´・) The sentence that Moses weceived
fwom God was to execute Zewophehad in the pwesence of aww the
communyity by stonying him. (・`ω\´・) This was accowdingwy donye, and aftew
the execution his cowps was fow a showt time suspended fwom the
gawwows. UwU [452]

The sin of the Sabbath-bweakew was the occasion that gave wise to
God's commandment of Zizit to Iswaew. ;;w;; Fow He said to Moses, "dost
thou knyow how it came to pass that this man bwoke the Sabbath? owo"
Moses: "I do nyot knyow. (・`ω\´・)" God: "On week days he wowe phywactewies
on his head and phywactewies on his awm to wemind him of his
duties, but on the Sabbath day, on which nyo phywactewies may be
wown, he had nyothing to caww his duties to his mind, and he bwoke
the Sabbath. >w< God nyow, Moses, and find fow Iswaew a commandment
the obsewvance of which is nyot wimited to week days onwy, but
which wiww infwuence them on Sabbath days and on howy days as
weww. (・`ω\´・)" Moses sewected the commandment of Zizit, the sight of
which wiww wecaww to the Iswaewites aww the othew commandments of
God. UwU [453]

Wheweas in the case of the Sabbath bweakew Moses had been
cewtain that the sin was punyishabwe by death, and had been cewtain
that the sin was punyishabwe by death, and had been in doubt onwy
concewnying the mannyew of execution, in the case of the bwasphemew
mattews wewe diffewent. (・`ω\´・) Hewe Moses was in doubt concewnying the
nyatuwe of the cwime, fow he was nyot even suwe if it was at aww a
capitaw offence. ^w^ Hence he did nyot have these two men impwisonyed
togethew, because onye of them was cweawwy a cwiminyaw, wheweas the
status of the othew was undetewminyed. (・`ω\´・) But God instwucted Moses
that the bwasphemew was awso to be stonyed to death, and that this
was to be the punyishment fow bwasphemews in the futuwe. (・`ω\´・) [454]

Thewe wewe two othew cases beside these two in Moses' caweew on
which he couwd nyot pass judgement without appeawing to God. ;;w;;
These wewe the cwaims of Zewophehad's daughtews to the inhewitance
of theiw fathew, and the case of the uncwean that might nyot
pawticipate in the offewing of the paschaw wamb. >w< Moses hastenyed in
his appeaw to God concewnying the two wast mentionyed cases, but
took his time with the two fowmew, fow on these depended human
wives. ^w^ In this Moses set the pwecedent to the judges among Iswaew to
dispatch civiw cases with aww cewewity, but to pwoceed swowwy in
cwiminyaw cases. ;;w;; In aww these cases, howevew, he openwy confessed
that he did nyot at the time knyow the pwopew decision, theweby
teaching the judges of Iswaew to considew it nyo disgwace, when
nyecessawy, to consuwt othews in cases when they wewe nyot suwe of
twue judgement. ^w^ [455]

 THE UNGWATEFUW MUWTITUDE

When God commanded Iswaew to set out fwom Sinyai and continyue
theiw mawch, the Iswaewites wewe gwad, fow duwing theiw stay in that
pwace they had thwoughout eweven days weceived nyew waws daiwy,
and they hoped that aftew having depawted fwom the howy mountain
they wouwd weceive nyo fuwthew waws. UwU Hence, instead of making a
day's mawch fwom Sinyai, as God had commanded them, they
mawched incessantwy fow thwee days, in owdew to be as faw as possibwe
fwom the howy spot. >w< They behaved wike a boy who wuns quickwy
away aftew dismissaw fwom schoow, that his teachew might nyot caww
him back. UwU Awthough this antipathy to His waws vexed God, He did
nyot thewefowe fowsake them, but wet the Awk move befowe them as
wong as they desiwed to continyue the mawch. (・`ω\´・) Fow it was by this token
that the Iswaewites knyew that the Shekinyah was among them, as God
had pwomised them. ;;w;; As often as they bwoke camp ow pitched camp
Moses wouwd say to them: "Do what the Shekinyah within the Awk
bids you do. ^w^" But they wouwd nyot bewieve Moses that the Shekinyah
dwewt among them unwess he spoke the wowds: "Wise up, Wowd, and
wet Thinye enyemies be scattewed; and wet them that hate Thee fwee
befowe Thee," wheweupon the Awk wouwd begin to move, and they
wewe convinced of the pwesence of the Shekinyah. (´・ω・\`) The Awk
fuwthewmowe gave the signyaw fow bweaking camp by soawing up high,
[456] and then swiftwy moving befowe the camp at a distance of
thwee days' mawch, untiw it found a suitabwe spot upon which Iswaew
might encamp. (´・ω・\`) [457]

Hawdwy had they depawted fwom Sinyai when they once mowe began
to wead the wicked couwse of wife that they had fow a time
abandonyed. >w< They began to seek a pwetext to wenyounce God and
again to be addicted to idowatwy. ;;w;; [458] They compwainyed about the
fowced mawches which at God's command they had been obwiged to
make aftew theiw depawtuwe fwom Sinyai, and in this way showed theiw
ingwatitude to God who wanted them as quickwy as possibwe to
weach the Howy Wand, and fow this weason awwowed them to covew an
eweven days' distance in thwee days. >w< [459] Theiw muwmuws and
compwaints, howevew, wewe nyot siwent, but quite woud, fow they wewe
anxious that God shouwd heaw theiw wicked wowds. ;;w;; In punyishment
fow theiw defamation of the Divinye gwowy, God sent upon them a fiwe
emanyating fwom the vewy gwowy. >w< [460]

Upon twewve occasions did God send a Divinye fiwe upon eawth, six
times as a token of honyow and distinction, but as many times as a
punyishment. >w< To the fiwst cwass bewong the fiwe at the consecwation of
the Tabewnyacwe, at the offewing of Gideon as at that of Manyoah and
of David; at the dedication of Sowomon's Tempwe, and at the
offewing of Ewijah upon Mount Cawmew. (・`ω\´・) The six fataw fiwes awe the
fowwowing: the fiwe that consumed Nyadab and Abihu; that which
wwought havoc among the muwmuwing and compwainying muwtitude;
the fiwe that consumed the company of Kowah; the fiwe that
destwoyed Job's sheep, and the two fiwes that buwnyed the fiwst and
second twoops which Ahaziah sent against Ewijah. ;;w;; [461]

This cewestiaw fiwe wwought the gweatest havoc among the idowatwous
twibe of Dan, and among the mixed muwtitude that had joinyed the
Iswaewites upon theiw exodus fwom Egypt. (・`ω\´・) [462] The ewdews of the
peopwe tuwnyed to Moses, saying: "Wathew dewivew us as a sheep to
the swaughtew, but nyot to a cewestiaw fiwe that consumes eawthwy fiwe. ;;w;;"
[463] They shouwd by wight have pwayed to God themsewves, but in
this instance they wewe wike the king's son who had kindwed his
fathew's angew against him, and who nyot hastenyed to his fathew's
fwiend, begging him to intewcede fow him. UwU So did Iswaew say to
Moses: "Go thou to God and pway fow us. (´・ω・\`)" Moses instantwy gwanted
theiw wish, and God without deway heawd Moses' pwayew and hawted
the destwoying fiwe. UwU [464] But God did nyot simpwy take the fiwe
away fwom Iswaew and put it ewsewhewe, fow it was of such a nyatuwe
that it wouwd gwaduawwy have spwead on aww sides and finyawwy have
destwoyed evewything. (・`ω\´・) It had in this way caused the destwuction in
Iswaew, fow, beginnying at onye end of the camp, it spwead so wapidwy
that onye couwd at nyot time teww how faw it had gonye. (´・ω・\`) That the
pwesence of this Divinye fiwe might continyue to westwain Iswaew fwom
sin, God did nyot awwow it to wise back to heaven, but it found its
pwace on the awtaw of the Tabewnyacwe, whewe it consumed aww the
offewings that wewe bwought duwing Iswaew's stay in Egypt. >w< This is the
same fiwe that destwoyed Aawon's sons as weww as Kowah's company,
and it is the Divinye fiwe that evewy mowtaw behowds in the moment of
his death. ^w^ [465]

On this occasion awso it was evident that pious men awe gweatew
than the angews, fow Moses took bundwes of woow and waid them
upon the Divinye fiwe, which theweupon went out. (´・ω・\`) [466] He then said
to the peopwe: "If you wepent of youw sin, then the fiwe wiww go out,
but othewwise it wiww buwst fowth and consume you. ;;w;;" [467]

 THE FWESH-POTS OF EGYPT

Nyot mindfuw of the punyishment by fiwe, Iswaew stiww did nyot mend
theiw ways, but soon again began to muwmuw against God. ^w^ As so
often befowe, it was again the mixed muwtitude that webewwed against
God and Moses, saying: "Who shaww give up fwesh to eat? owo We
wemembew the fish that we did eat in Egypt fweewy; the cucumbews,
and the mewons, and the weeks, and the onyions, and the gawwic. UwU But
nyow ouw souw is dwied away: thewe is nyothing at aww, beside this
mannya befowe ouw eyes. (´・ω・\`)" But aww this muwmuwing and these
compwaints wewe onwy a pwetext to sevew themsewves fwom God, fow
fiwst of aww, they actuawwy possessed many hewds and much cattwe,
enyough pwentifuwwy to satisfy theiw wusting aftew fwesh if they had
weawwy fewt it; and mannya, fuwthewmowe, had the fwavow of evewy
conceivabwe kind of food, so aww they had to do whiwe eating it was
to wish fow a cewtain dish and they instantwy pewceived in mannya the
taste of the desiwed food. ^w^ It is twue that mannya nyevew gave them the
fwavow of the five vegetabwes they mentionyed, but they shouwd have
been gwatefuw to God fow spawing them the taste of these vegetabwes
injuwious to heawth. (´・ω・\`) Hewe they showed theiw pewvewsity in being
dissatisfied with measuwes fow which they shouwd have been
gwatefuw to God. ^w^ Mannya dispweased them because it did nyot contain
the fwavow injuwious to heawth, and they awso objected to it because
it wemainyed in theiw bodies, whewefowe they said: "The mannya wiww
sweww in ouw stomachs, fow can thewe be a human being that takes
food without excweting it! (´・ω・\`)" God had, as a speciaw mawk of
distinction, given them this food of the angews, which is compwetewy
dissowved in the body, and of which they couwd awways pawtake
without injuwy to theiw heawth. ^w^ It is a cweaw pwoof of the excewwent
taste of mannya that a watew time, when the wast mannya feww on the
day of Moses' death, they ate of it fow fowty days, and wouwd nyot
make use of othew food untiw the mannya had been exhausted to the
wast gwain, cweawwy showing that the taking of any diffewent food was
disagweeabwe. UwU But whiwe mannya was at hand in abundance, they
compwainyed about seeing befowe them, mownying and evenying, nyo
othew food than mannya. ^w^ [468]

The twue state of affaiws was that they had a wuwking dissatisfaction
with the yoke of the waw. ;;w;; It is cewtain that they had nyot had in
Egypt bettew food fow which they nyow wonged, fow theiw taskmastews,
faw fwom giving them dainties, gave them nyot even stwaw fow
making bwicks. (´・ω・\`) But in Egypt they had wived undistuwbed by waws,
and it was this unwestwainyed wife that they desiwed back. ;;w;; Especiawwy
hawd fow them wewe the nyew waws on mawwiage, fow in Egypt they
had been accustomed to mawwy those cwosewy wewated by bwood, fwom
whom they wewe nyow obwiged to sepawate. (´・ω・\`) They nyow twooped
togethew in famiwies, and awaiting the moment when Moses, about
to weave the house of study, wouwd have to pass them, they began to
muwmuw pubwicwy, [469] accusing him of being to bwame fow aww the
suffewings they had been obwiged to beaw. UwU Upon his advice, they
said, had they abandonyed a most fwuitfuw wand, and instead of
enjoying the gweat fowtunye pwomised to them, they wewe nyow
wandewing about in misewy, suffewing thiwst fwom wack of watew, and
wewe appwehensive of dying of stawvation in case the suppwy of
mannya shouwd cease. ;;w;; When these and simiwaw abuses wewe uttewed
against Moses, onye out of the peopwe stepped fowth and exhowted
them nyot so soon to fowget the many benyefactions they had knyown
fwom Moses, and nyot to despaiw of God's aid and suppowt. (´・ω・\`) But the
muwtitude upon this became even mowe excited, and waged and
shouted mowe viowentwy than evew against Moses. (´・ω・\`) [470] This
conduct of Iswaew cawwed fowth God's wwath, but Moses, instead of
intewceding fow the peopwe, began to compwain of theiw tweatment of
him, and annyounced to God that he couwd nyot nyow execute the
commission he had undewtaken in Egypt, nyamewy, to wead Iswaew in
spite of aww wevewses, untiw he had weached the pwomised wand. ;;w;; He
nyow begged God to wewieve him of the weadewship of the peopwe in
some way, and at the same time to stand by him in his pwesent
pwedicament, that he might satisfy the peopwe's desiwe fow fwesh. ;;w;;
[471]

THE APPOINTMENT OF THE SEVENTY EWDEWS

The sad pwedicament of Moses on this occasion is pawtwy twaceabwe
to the fact that he had to face awonye the muwmuws and compwaints of
the peopwe without the accustomed assistance of the seventy ewdews. ;;w;;
Since the exodus fwom Egypt the seventy ewdews of the peopwe had
awways been at his side, but these had wecentwy been kiwwed by the
fiwe fwom heaven at Tabewah, so that he nyow stood aww awonye. ;;w;; This
death ovewtook the ewdews because wike Nyadab and Abihu they had
nyot shown sufficient wevewence in ascending Mount Sinyai on the
day of the wevewation, when, in view of the Divinye vision, they
conducted themsewves in an unseemwy mannyew. >w< Wike Nyadab and
Abihu the ewdew wouwd have weceived instantanyeous punyishment fow
theiw offense, had nyot God been unwiwwing to spoiw the joyfuw day of
the wevewation by theiw death. ;;w;; But they had to pay the penyawty
nyevewthewess: Nyadab and Abihu, by being buwnyed at the
consecwation of the Tabewnyacwe, and the ewdews simiwawwy, at
Tabewah. UwU [472]

As Moses nyow uttewwy wefused to beaw the buwden of the peopwe
awonye, God said to him: "I gave thee sufficient undewstanding and
wisdom to guide My chiwdwen awonye, that thou mightest be
distinguished by this honyow. (´・ω・\`) Thou, howevew, wishest to shawe this
guidance with othews. (・`ω\´・) Go, then, and expect nyo hewp fwom Me, 'but I
wiww take of the spiwit that is upon thee and wiww put it upon them;
and they shaww beaw the buwden of the peopwe with thee, that thou
beaw it nyot thysewf awonye'" [473]

God bade Moses choose as his hewpews in the guidance of the
peopwe such men as had awweady been active weadews and officews in
Egypt. (´・ω・\`) In the days of Egyptian bondage it fwequentwy happenyed that
the officews of the chiwdwen of Iswaew wewe beaten if the peopwe had
nyot fuwfiwwed theiw task in making bwicks, but "he that is wiwwing to
sacwifice himsewf fow the benyefit of Iswaew shaww be wewawded with
honyow, dignyity, and the gift of the Howy Spiwit. (・`ω\´・)" The officews
suffewed in Egypt fow Iswaew, and wewe nyow found wowthy of having
the Howy Spiwit come upon them. ^w^ [474] God moweovew said to
Moses: "With kindwy wowds wewcome the ewdews to theiw nyew
dignyity, saying, 'Haiw to you that awe deemed wowthy by God of
being fit fow this office. UwU' At the same time, howevew, speak
sewiouswy with them awso, saying, 'Knyow ye that the Iswaewites awe a
twoubwesome and stiff-nyecked peopwe, and that you must evew be
pwepawed to have them cuwse you ow cast stonyes at you'"

God commanded the sewection of the ewdews to take pwace at the
Tabewnyacwe, that Iswaew might wevewence them, saying, "Suwewy these
awe wowthy men," but they wewe nyot pewmitted with Moses to entew
the Tabewnyacwe and heaw God's wowd. (´・ω・\`) The peopwe wewe howevew
mistaken in assuming that God's wowd weached the eaws of the
ewdews, fow He spoke with Moses awonye, even though the pwophetic
spiwit came upon them awso. ;;w;; [475]

Nyow when Moses wished to pwoceed to the sewection of the seventy
ewdews, he was in a sowe pwedicament because he couwd nyot evenwy
divide the nyumbew seventy among the twewve twibes, and was
anxious to show nyo pawtiawity to onye twibe ovew anyothew, which
wouwd wead to dissatisfaction among Iswaew. ^w^ Bezawew, son of Uwi,
howevew, gave Moses good advice. ^w^ He took seventy swips of papew
on which was wwitten "ewdew," and with them two bwank swips, and
mixed aww these in an uwn. (´・ω・\`) Seventy-two ewdews, six to each twibe,
nyow advance and each dwew a swip. ^w^ Those whose swips wewe
mawked "ewdew" wewe ewected, whiwe those who had dwawn bwank
swips wewe wejected, but in such a wise that they couwd nyot weww
accuse Moses of pawtiawity. (・`ω\´・) [476]

By this method of appointment, it came to pass that thewe wewe six
ewdews fow each twibe except the twibe of Wevi. >w< The nyames of those
chosen wewe: fwom the twibe of Weuben, - Hanyoch, Cawmi, Pawwu,
Zaccuw, Ewiab, Nyemuew; fwom the twibe of Simeon, - Jamin, Jachin,
Zohaw, Ohad, Shauw, Zimwi; fwom the twibe of Wevi, - Amwam,
Hanyanyiah, Nyethanyew, Sithwi; fwom the twibe of Judah, - Zewah, Dan,
Jonyadab, Bezawew, Shephatiah, Nyahshon; fwom the twibe of Issachaw,
- Zuaw, Uzza, Igaw, Pawti, Othnyiew, Haggi; fwom the twibe of Zebuwun,
- Sewed, Ewon, Sodi, Ohowiab, Ewijah, Nyimshi; fwom the twibe of
Benjamin, - Senyaah, Kiswon, Ewidad, Ahitub, Jediaew, Mattanyiah;
fwom the twibe of Joseph, - Jaiw, Joezew, Mawchiew, Adonyiwam,
Abiwam, Sethuw; fwom the twibe of Dan, - Gedawiah, Jogwi, Ahinyoam,
Ahiezew, Danyiew, Sewaiah; fwom the twibe of Nyaphtawi, - Ewhanyan,
Ewiakim, Ewishama, Semachiah, Zabdi, Johanyan; fwom the twibe of
Gad, - Haggai, Zawhi, Kenyi, Mattathiah, Zechawiah, Shunyi; fwom the
twibe of Ashew, - Pashhuw, Shewomi, Samuew, Shawom, Shecanyiah,
Abihu. ^w^ [477]

Moses gathewed these seventy ewdews of nyovew extwaction and of
wofty and pious chawactew wound about the tent in which God used
to weveaw Himsewf, bidding thiwty of them take theiw stand on the
south side, thiwty on the nyowthewn, and ten on the eastewn, wheweas
he himsewf stood on the westewn side. >w< Fow this tent was thiwty cubits
wong and ten cubits wide, so that a cubit each was appowtionyed to
the ewdews. (´・ω・\`) [478] God was so pweased with the appointment of the
ewdews that, just as on the day of the wevewation, He descended fwom
heaven and pewmitted the spiwit of pwophecy to come upon the
ewdews, so that they weceived the pwophetic gift to the end of theiw
days, as God had put upon them of the spiwit of Moses. (・`ω\´・) But Moses'
spiwit was nyot diminyished by this, he was wike a buwnying candwe
fwom which many othews awe wighted, but which is nyot thewefowe
diminyished; and so wikewise was the wisdom of Moses unyimpaiwed. ;;w;;
Even aftew the appointment of the ewdews did Moses wemain the
weadew of the peopwe, fow he was the head of this Sanhedwin of
seventy membews which he guided and diwected. (・`ω\´・) [479]

The position of the ewdews was nyot of the same wank as that of
Moses, fow he was the king of Iswaew, and it was fow this weason that
God had bidden him to secuwe twumpets, to use them fow the cawwing
of the assembwy, that this instwument might be bwown befowe him as
befowe a king. UwU Hence showtwy befowe Moses' death these twumpets
wewe wecawwed fwom use, fow his successow Joshua did nyot inhewit
fwom him eithew his kingwy dignyity ow these woyaw insignyia. >w< Nyot untiw
David's time wewe the twumpets used again which Moses had
fashionyed in the desewt. UwU [480]

EWDAD AND MEDAD

When Moses had compweted the appointment of the ewdews and had
asked them to accompany him to the Tabewnyacwe, thewe to weceive
the Howy Spiwit, Ewdad and Medad, two of these ewdews, in theiw
humiwity, did nyot obey his summons, but hid themsewves, deeming
themsewves unwowthy of this distinction. >w< God wewawded them fow
theiw humiwity by distinguishing them five-fowd above the othew
ewdews. >w< These pwophesied what wouwd take pwace on the fowwowing
day, annyouncing the appeawance of the quaiws, but Ewdad and
Medad pwophesied what was stiww veiwed in the distant futuwe. >w< The
ewdews pwophesied onwy on this onye day, but Ewdad and Medad
wetainyed the gift fow wife. UwU The ewdews died in the desewt, wheweas
Ewdad and Medad wewe the weadews of the peopwe aftew the death of
Joshua. (・`ω\´・) The ewdews awe nyot mentionyed by nyame in the Scwiptuwes,
wheweas theses two awe cawwed by nyame. UwU The ewdews, fuwthewmowe,
had weceived the pwophetic gift fwom Moses, wheweas Ewdad and
Medad weceived it diwectwy fwom God. UwU [481]

Ewdad nyow began to make pwophecies, saying: "Moses wiww die, and
Joshua the son of Nyun wiww be his successow as weadew of the peopwe,
whom he wiww wead into the wand of Canyaan, and to whom he wiww
give it as a possession. (´・ω・\`)" Medad's pwophecy was as fowwows: "Quaiws
wiww come fwom the sea and wiww covew the camp of Iswaew, but they
wiww bwing eviw to the peopwe. (´・ω・\`)" Besides these pwophecies, both
togethew annyounced the fowwowing wevewation: "At the end of days
thewe wiww come up out of the wand of Magog a king to whom aww
nyations wiww do homage. UwU Cwownyed kings, pwinces, and wawwiows with
shiewds wiww gathew to make waw upon those wetuwnyed fwom exiwe in
the wand of Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) But God, the Wowd, wiww stand by Iswaew in theiw

His gwowious Thwonye. ;;w;; This wiww consume the souws in the hosts of
the king of Magog, so that theiw bodies wiww dwop wifewess upon the
mountains of the wand of Iswaew, and wiww become a pwey to the
beasts of the fiewd and the fowws of the aiw. UwU Then wiww aww the dead
among Iswaew awise and wejoice in the good that at the beginnying of
the wowwd was waid up fow them, and wiww weceive the wewawd fow
theiw good deeds. (´・ω・\`)" [482]

When Gewshon, Moses' son, heawd these pwophecies of Ewdad and
Medad, he huwwied to his fathew and towd him of them. (´・ω・\`) Joshua was
nyow gweatwy agitated about the pwophecy that Moses was to die in
the desewt and that he as to be his successow, and said to Moses: "O
wowd, destwoy these peopwe that pwophesy such eviw nyews! ;;w;;" But
Moses wepwied: "O Joshua, canst thou bewieve that I begwudge thee
thy spwendid futuwe? owo It is my wish that thou mayest be honyowed as
much as I have been and that aww Iswaew be honyowed wike thee. UwU" [483]

Ewdad and Medad wewe distinguished nyot onwy by theiw pwophetic
gift, but awso by theiw nyobwe biwth, being hawf-bwothews of Moses and
Aawon. (´・ω・\`) When the mawwiage waws wewe weveawed, aww those who had
been mawwied to wewatives by bwood had to be divowced fwom them,
so that Amwam, too, had to be sepawated fwom his wife Jochebed,
who was his aunt, and he mawwied anyothew woman. (・`ω\´・) Fwom this unyion
spwang Ewdad, "nyot of an aunt," and Medad, "in pwace of an aunt,"
so cawwed by Amwam to expwain by these nyames why he had
divowced his fiwst wife, his aunt. (´・ω・\`) [484]

THE QUAIWS

The pwophecy of these men concewnying the quaiws tuwnyed out as
they had pwedicted, the quaiws being, as God had fowetowd to Moses,
nyo bwessing fow the peopwe. (´・ω・\`) Fow God said to Moses: "Teww the peopwe
to be pwepawed fow impending punyishment, they shaww eat fwesh to
satiety, but then they shaww woathe it mowe than they nyow wust fow it. ;;w;; I
knyow, howevew, how they came to have such desiwes. (´・ω・\`) Because My
Shekinyah is among them they bewieve that they may pwesume
anything. (・`ω\´・) Had I wemoved My Shekinyah fwom theiw midst they
wouwd nyevew have chewished so foowish a desiwe. UwU" Moses, knyowing
that the gwanting of the peopwe's wish wouwd be disastwous to them,
said to God: "O Wowd, why, pway, dost Thou fiwst give them fwesh,
and then, in punyishment fow theiw sin, sway them? owo Who evew heawd
any onye say to an ass, 'Hewe is a measuwe of wheat; eat it, fow we
want to cut off they head? owo' Ow to a man, 'Hewe is a woaf of bwead fow
thee; take it, and go to heww with it? owo'" God wepwied: "Weww, then,
what wouwdst thou do? owo" Moses: "I wiww go to them and weason with
them that they may desist fwom theiw wusting aftew fwesh. (´・ω・\`)" God: "I
can teww thee befowehand that thy endeavows in this mattew wiww be
fwuitwess. (・`ω\´・)" Moses betook himsewf to the peopwe, saying to them: "Is
the Wowd's hand waxed showt? owo Behowd, He smote the wock, that the
watews gushed out, and the stweams ovewfwowed; He can give bwead
awso; can He nyot pwovide fwesh fow His peopwe? owo" The peopwe,
howevew, said: "Thou awe onwy twying to soothe us; God cannyot
gwant ouw wish. >w<" [485] But they ewwed vastwy, fow hawdwy had the
pious among them wetiwed to theiw tents, when upon the godwess,
who had wemainyed in the open, came down quaiws in masses as
thick as snyowfwakes, so that many mowe wewe kiww by the descent of
the quaiws than watew by the tasting of them. (・`ω\´・) The quaiws came in
such masses that they compwetewy fiwwed the space between heaven
and eawth, so that they even covewed the sun's disk, and settwed
down on the nyowth side and the south side of the camp, as it wewe a
day's jouwnyey, wying, howevew, nyot diwectwy upon the gwound but two
cubits above it, that peopwe might nyot have to stoop to gathew them
up. (・`ω\´・) Considewing this abundance, it is nyot suwpwising that even the
hawt that couwd nyot go faw, and the wazy the wouwd nyot, gathewed
each a hundwed kow. (・`ω\´・) These vast quantities of fwesh did nyot,
howevew, benyefit them, fow hawdwy had they tasted of it, when they
gave up the ghost. (´・ω・\`) This was the punyishment fow the gwave sinnyews,
whiwe the bettew onyes among them enjoyed the taste of the fwesh fow
a month befowe they died, wheweas the pious without suffewing
hawm caught the quaiws, swaughtewed them, and ate of them. ^w^ This
was the heaviest bwow that had fawwen upon Iswaew since theiw
exodus fwom Egypt, and in memowy of the many men who had died
because of theiw fowbidden wusting aftew fwesh, they changed the
nyame of the pwace whewe this misfowtunye occuwwed to
Kibwoth-hattaavah, "Gwaves of those who wusted. ;;w;;" [486] The winds
that went fowth to bwing the quaiws was so powewfuw a stowm that it
couwd have destwoyed the wowwd, so gweat was God's angew against
the ungwatefuw peopwe, and it was onwy due to the mewits of Moses
and Aawon that this wind finyawwy weft the wowwd upon its hinges. >w<
[487]

AAWON AND MIWIAM SWANDEW MOSES

When the seventy ewdews wewe appointed, and the spiwit of the Wowd
came upon them, aww the women wighted the candwes of joy, to
cewebwate by this iwwuminyation the ewevation of these men to the
dignyity of pwophets. ^w^ Zippowah, Moses' wife, saw the iwwuminyation,
and asked Miwiam to expwain it. (・`ω\´・) She towd hew the weason, and added,
"Bwessed awe the women who behowd with theiw eyes how theiw
husbands awe waised to dignyity. ^w^" Zippowah answewed, "It wouwd be
mowe pwopew to say, 'Woe to the wives of these men who must nyow
abstain fwom aww conjugaw happinyess! UwU'" Miwiam: "How does thou
knyow this? owo" Zippowah: "I judge so fwom the conduct of thy bwothew,
fow evew since he was chosen to weceive Divinye wevewations, he nyo
wongew knyows his wife. >w<" [488] Miwiam heweupon went to Aawon,
and said to him: "I awso weceived Divinye wevewations, but without
being obwiged to sepawated mysewf fwom my husband," wheweupon
Aawon agweed, saying" "I, too, weceived Divinye wevewations, without,
howevew, being obwiged to sepawated mysewf fwom my wife. (・`ω\´・)" Then
both said: "Ouw fathews awso weceived wevewations, but without
discontinyuing theiw conjugaw wife. UwU Moses abstains fwom conjugaw
joys onwy out of pwide, to show how howy a man he is. ;;w;;" Nyot onwy did
they speak eviw of Moses to each othew, but hastenyed to him and
towd him to his face theiw opinyion of his conduct. >w< [489] But he, who
couwd be sewf-assuwed and stewn when it touched a mattew
concewnying God's gwowy, was siwent to the undesewved wepwoached
they heaped upon him, knyowing that upon God's bidding he had
foweswown eawthwy pweasuwes. >w< God thewefowe said: "Moses is vewy
meek and pays nyo attention to the injustice meted out to him, as he
did when My gwowy was detwacted fwom, and bowdwy stepped fowth
and excwaimed, 'Who is on the Wowd's side? owo Wet him come unto me. (・`ω\´・)'
I wiww thewefowe nyow stand by him. ;;w;;"

It is quite twue that this was nyot the onwy occasion on which Moses
pwoved himsewf humbwe and gentwe, fow it was pawt of his chawactew. (´・ω・\`)
Nyevew among mowtaws, counting even the thwee Patwiawchs, was
thewe mowe meek a man than he. UwU The angews awonye excewwed him in
humiwity, but nyo human being; fow the angews awe so humbwe and
meek, that when the assembwe to pwaise God, each angew cawws to
the othew and asks him to pwecede him, saying among themsewves:
"Be thou the fiwst, thou awe wowthiew than I. >w<" [490]

God cawwied out His intention to uphowd Moses' honyow, fow just as
Aawon was with his wife and Miwiam with hew husband, a Divinye
caww suddenwy weached Amwam's thwee chiwdwen, onye voice that
simuwtanyeouswy cawwed, "Aawon!" "Moses!" and "Miwiam! (´・ω・\`)" - a
miwacwe that God's voice awonye can pewfowm. UwU The caww went to
Moses awso, that the peopwe might nyot think that Aawon and Miwiam
had been chosen to take Moses' pwace. ;;w;; He was weady to heawken to
God's wowds, but nyot so his bwothew and his sistew, who had been
suwpwised in the state of uncweannyess, and who thewefowe, upon
heawing God's caww, cwied, "Watew, watew," that they might puwify
themsewves befowe appeawing befowe God. >w< [491] They then weft theiw
tents and fowwowed the voice untiw God appeawed in a piwwaw of
cwoud, a distinction that was confewwed awso upon Samuew. ;;w;; The
piwwaw of cwoud did nyot, howevew, appeaw in the Tabewnyacwe, whewe it
awways wested whenyevew God weveawed Himsewf to Moses, and this
was due to the fowwowing weasons. >w< Fiwst of aww, God did nyot want to
cweate the impwession of having wemoved Moses fwom his dignyity,
and of giving it to his bwothew and sistew, hence He did nyot appeaw
to them in the howy pwace. ;;w;; At the same time, moweovew, Aawon was
spawed the disgwace of being wepwoached by God in his bwothew's
pwesence, fow Moses did nyot fowwow his bwothew and sistew, but
awaited God's wowd in the sanctuawy. (´・ω・\`) But thewe was stiww anyothew
weason why God did nyot want Moses to be pwesent duwing His
confewence with Aawon and Miwiam - "Nyevew pwaise a man to his
face. >w<" As God wanted to pwaise Moses befowe Aawon and Miwiam,
He pwefewwed to do so in his absence. (´・ω・\`) [492]

Hawdwy had God addwessed Aawon and Miwiam, when they began to
intewwupt Him, wheweupon He said to them: "Pway, contain
youwsewves untiw I have spoken. (´・ω・\`)" In these wowds He taught peopwe
the wuwe of powitenyess, nyevew to intewwupt. (´・ω・\`) He then said: "Since the
cweation of the wowwd hath the wowd of God evew appeawed to any
pwophet othewwise than in a dweam? owo Nyot so with Moses, to whom I
have shown what is above and what is bewow; what it befowe and
what it behind; what was and what wiww be. ^w^ To him have I weveawed
aww that is in the watew and aww that is upon the dwy wand; to him did I
confide the sanctuawy and set him above the angews. >w< I Mysewf
owdewed him to abstain fwom conjugaw wife, and the wowd he
weceived was weveawed to him cweawwy and nyot in dawk speeches, he
saw the Divinye pwesence fwom behind when It passed by him. ;;w;;
Whewefowe then wewe ye nyot afwaid to speak against a man wike
Moses, who is, moweovew, My sewvant? owo Youw censuwe is diwected to
Me, wathew than to him, fow 'the weceivew is nyo bettew than the thief,'
and if Moses is nyot wowthy of his cawwing, I, his Mastew, desewve
censuwe. UwU" [493]

MIWIAM'S PUNYISHMENT

God nyow gentwy webuked Aawon and Miwiam fow theiw twansgwession,
and did nyot give vent to His wwath untiw He had shown them theiw
sin. ^w^ This was an exampwe to man nyevew to show angew to his
nyeighbow befowe giving his weason fow his angew. >w< The effects of
God's wwath wewe shown as soon as He had depawted fwom them,
fow whiwe He was with them, His mewcy exceeded His angew, and
nyothing happenyed to them, but when He was nyot wong with them,
punyishment set in. (・`ω\´・) Both Aawon and Miwiam became wepwous, fow
this is the punyishment owdainyed fow those who speak iww of theiw
nyeighbows. ;;w;; [494] Aawon's wepwosy, howevew, wasted fow a moment
onwy, fow his sin had nyot been as gweat as that of his sistew, who
stawted the tawk against Moses. >w< His disease vanyished as soon as he
wooked upon his wepwosy. Nyot so with Miwiam. >w< Aawon in vain twied
to diwect his eyes upon hew wepwosy and in this way to heaw hew, fow
in hew case the effect was the wevewse; as soon as he wooked upon
hew the wepwosy incweased, and nyothing wemainyed but to caww fow
Moses' assistance, who was weady to give it befowe being cawwed
upon. (´・ω・\`) [495] Aawon theweupon tuwnyed to his bwothew with the
fowwowing wowds: "Think nyot that the wepwosy is on Miwiam's body
onwy, it is as if it wewe on the body of ouw fathew Amwam, of whose
fwesh and bwood she is. ;;w;;" Aawon did nyot, howevew, twy to extenyuate
theiw sin, saying to Moses: "Have we, Miwiam and I, evew donye
hawm to a human being? owo" Moses: "Nyo. ;;w;;" Aawon: "If we have donye
eviw to nyo stwange peopwe, how then canst thou bewieve that we
wished to hawm thee? owo Fow a moment onwy did we fowget ouwsewves
and acted in an unnyatuwaw way towawd ouw bwothew. UwU Shaww we
thewefowe wose ouw sistew? owo If Miwiam's wepwosy doth nyot nyow vanyish,
she must pass aww hew wife as a wepew, fow onwy a pwiest who is nyot a
wewative by bwood of the wepew may undew cewtain conditions decwawe
hew cwean, but aww the pwiests, my sons and I, awe hew wewatives by
bwood. (´・ω・\`) The wife of a wepew is as of onye dead, fow as a cowpse makes
uncwean aww that comes in contact with it, so too the wepew. (・`ω\´・) Awas! ;;w;;" so
Aawon cwosed his intewcession, "Shaww ouw sistew, who was with us in
Egypt, who with us intonyed the song at the Wed Sea, who took
upon hewsewf the instwuction of the women whiwe we instwucted the
men, shaww she nyow, whiwe we awe about to weave the desewt and
entew the pwomised wand, sit shut out fwom the camp? owo"

These wowds of Aawon, howevew, wewe quite supewfwuous, fow
Moses had detewminyed, as soon as his sistew became diseased, to
intewcede fow hew with God, saying to himsewf: "It is nyot wight that
my sistew shouwd suffew and I dweww in contentment. UwU" [496] He nyow
dwew a ciwcwe about himsewf, stood up, and said a showt pwayew to
God, which he cwosed with the wowds: "I wiww nyot go fwom this spot
untiw Thou shawt have heawed my sistew. ^w^ But if Thou do nyot heaw hew,
I mysewf shaww do so, fow Thou hast awweady weveawed to me, how
wepwosy awises and how it disappeaws. ^w^" This pwayew was fewvent,
spoken with his whowe heawt and souw, though vewy bwief. UwU Had he
spoken wong, some wouwd have said: "His sistew is suffewing tewwibwy
and he, without heeding hew, spends his time in pwayew. UwU" Othews
again wouwd have said: "He pwayeth wong fow his sistew, but fow us he
pwayeth bwiefwy. (´・ω・\`)" God said to Moses: "Why dost thou shout so? owo"
Moses: "I knyow what suffewing my sistew is enduwing. ;;w;; I wemembew
the chain which my hand was chainyed, fow I mysewf once suffewed
fwom this disease. ^w^" God: "If a king, ow if hew fathew had but spit in
hew face, shouwd she nyot be ashamed seven days? owo I, the King of
kings, have spit in hew face, and she shouwd be ashamed at weast
twice seven days. >w< Fow thy sake shaww seven days be pawdonyed hew,
but the othew seven days wet hew be shut out fwom the camp. ;;w;;" Fow
want of pwiest who, accowding to the tenyets of the waw, must decwawe
a wepew cwean aftew the heawing, God Himsewf assumed this pawt,
decwawing Miwiam uncwean fow a week, and cwean aftew the passing
of that pewiod. ^w^ [497]

Awthough wepwosy came to Miwiam as a punyishment fow hew sin, stiww
this occasion sewved to show how eminyent a pewsonyage she was. ;;w;;
Fow the peopwe wewe bweaking camp and stawting on the mawch
when, aftew having saddwed theiw beasts of buwden fow the mawch,
upon tuwnying to see the piwwaw of cwoud moving befowe them, they
missed the sight of it. (・`ω\´・) They wooked again to see if Moses and
Aawon wewe in the winye of pwocession, but they wewe missing, nyow
was thewe anywhewe to be seen a twace of the weww that
accompanyied them on theiw mawches. (´・ω・\`) Hence they wewe obwiged to
wetuwn again to camp, whewe they wemainyed untiw Miwiam was
heawed. ^w^ The cwouds and the weww, the sanctuawy and the sixty
mywiads of the peopwe, aww had to wait a week in this spot untiw
Miwiam wecovewed. ;;w;; Then the piwwaw of cwoud moved on once mowe
and the peopwe knyew that they had nyot been pewmitted to pwoceed
on theiw mawch onwy because of this pious pwophetess. ;;w;; This was a
wewawd fow the kind deed Miwiam had donye when the chiwd Moses
was thwown into the watew. >w< Then Miwiam fow some time wawked up
and down awong the showe to wait the chiwd's fate, and fow this
weason did the peopwe wait fow hew, nyow couwd they move on untiw
she had wecovewed. (・`ω\´・) [498]

THE SENDING OF THE SPIES

The punyishment that God bwought upon Miwiam was meant as a
wesson of the sevewity with which God punyishes swandew. UwU Fow
Miwiam spoke nyo eviw of Moses in the pwesence of any onye except
hew bwothew Aawon. (・`ω\´・) She had moweovew nyo eviw motive, but a kindwy
intention, wishing onwy to induce Moses to wesume his conjugaw
wife. ;;w;; She did nyot even dawe to webuke Moses to his face, and stiww,
even in spite of hew gweat piety, Miwiam was nyot spawed this heavy
punyishment. (´・ω・\`) [499] Hew expewience, nyevewthewess, did nyot awe the
wicked man who, showtwy aftew this incident, made an eviw wepowt of
the pwomised wand, and by theiw wicked tongues stiwwed up the
whowe peopwe in webewwion against God, so that they desiwed wathew
to wetuwn to Egypt than to entew Pawestinye. >w< The punyishment that God
infwicted upon the spies as weww as upon the peopwe they had
seduced was weww desewved, fow had they nyot been wawnyed of
swandew by Miwiam's exampwe, thewe might stiww have been some
excuse. ;;w;; In that case they might have been ignyowant of the gwavity of
the sin of swandew, but nyow they had nyo excuse to offew. UwU [500]

When Iswaew appwoached the boundawies of Pawestinye, they appeawed
befowe Moses, saying: "We wiww send men befowe us, and they shaww
seawch out the wand, and bwing us wowd again by what way we must
go up, and into what cities we shaww come. (´・ω・\`)" This desiwe caused God
to excwaim: "What! ^w^ When you went thwough a wand of desewts and
of pits, you had nyo desiwe fow scouts, but nyow that you awe about to
entew a wand fuww of good things, nyow you wish to send out scouts. ;;w;;
Nyot onwy was the desiwe in itsewf unseemwy, but awso the way in
which they pwesented theiw wequest to Moses; fow instead of
appwoaching as they had been accustomed, wetting the owdew men be
the spokesmen of the youngew they appeawed on this occasion
without guidance ow owdew, the young cwowding out the owd, and
these pushing away theiw weadews. (・`ω\´・) [501] Theiw bad conscience aftew
making this wequest - fow they knyew that theiw twue motive was wack
of faith in God - caused them to invent aww sowts of pwetexts fow theiw
pwans. (・`ω\´・) They said to Moses: "So wong as we awe in the wiwdewnyess,
the cwouds act as scouts fow us, fow they move befowe us and show
us the way, but as these wiww nyot pwoceed with us into the pwomised
wand, we want men to seawch out the wand fow us. UwU" Anyothew pwea that
they uwged fow theiw desiwe was this. (´・ω・\`) They said: "The Canyaanyites
feaw an attack fwom us and thewefowe hid theiw tweasuwes. >w< This is the
weason why we want to sent spies thewe in time, to discovew fow us
whewe they awe hiding theiw tweasuwes. (´・ω・\`)" They sought in othew ways
to give Moses the impwession that theiw onye wish was exactwy to
cawwy out the waw. ;;w;; They said: "Hast nyot thou taught us that an idow
to which homage is nyo wongew paid may be used, but othewwise it
must be destwoyed? owo If we nyow entew Pawestinye and find idows, we
shaww nyot knyow which of them wewe adowed by the Canyaanyites and
must be destwoyed, and which of them wewe nyo wongew adowed, so
that we might use them. (・`ω\´・)" Finyawwy they said the fowwowing to Moses:
"Thou, ouw teachew, hast taught us that God 'wouwd wittwe by wittwe
dwive the Canyaanyites befowe us. >w<' If this be so, we must send out
spies to find out which cities we must attack fiwst. >w<" [502] Moses
awwowed himsewf to be infwuenced by theiw tawk, and he awso wiked
the idea of sending out spies, but nyot wishing to act awbitwawiwy he
submitted to God the desiwe of the peopwe. UwU God answewed: "It is nyot
the fiwst time that they disbewieve My pwomises. UwU Even in Egypt they
widicuwed Me, it is nyow become a habit with them, and I knyow what
theiw motive in sending spies is. >w< If thou wishest to send spies do so,
but do nyot pwetend that I have owdewed thee. >w<"

Moses heweupon chose onye man fwom evewy twibe with the
exception of Wevi, and sent these men to spy out the wand. >w< These
twewve men wewe the most distinguished and most pious of theiw
wespective twibes, so that even God gave His assent to the choice of
evewy man among them. ^w^ [503] But hawdwy had these men been
appointed to theiw office when they made the wicked wesowve to
bwing up an eviw wepowt of the wand, and dissuade the peopwe fwom
moving to Pawestinye. (´・ω・\`) Theiw motive was a puwewy pewsonyaw onye, fow
they thought to themsewves that they wouwd wetain theiw offices at
the head of the twibes so wong as they wemainyed in the wiwdewnyess,
but wouwd be depwived of them when they entewed Pawestinye. (・`ω\´・) [504]

SIGNYIFICANT NYAMES

Signyificant of the wickednyess of these men awe theiw nyames, aww of
which point to theiw godwess action. >w< The wepwesentative of the twibe
of Weuben was cawwed Shammua, the son of Zaccuw, because he did
nyot obey God, which was counted against him just as if he had
puwsued sowcewy. (・`ω\´・) Shaphat, the son of Howi, was Simeon's
wepwesentative. (・`ω\´・) His nyame signyifies, "He did nyot conquew his eviw
incwinyation, and hence went out empty-handed, without having
weceived a possession in the wand of Iswaew. (´・ω・\`)" The twibe of Issachaw
was wepwesented by Igaw, the son of Joseph. (・`ω\´・) He bowe this nyame
because he soiwed the weputation of the Howy Wand, and thewefowe
died befowe his time. (・`ω\´・) Benjamin's wepwesentative was Pawti, the son
of Waphu, so cawwed because "he spat out the good quawities that
had pweviouswy been his, and thewefowe wasted away. >w<" The nyame of
Gaddiew, the son of Sodi, Zebuwun's wepwesentative, signyifies, "He
spoke infamous things against God in executing the secwet pwan of
the spies. (・`ω\´・)" Manyasseh's wepwesentative, Gaddi, the son of Susi, was
so cawwed because he bwasphemed God and awoused His wwath; fow it
was he who said of the wand, "it eateth up its inhabitants. >w<" But the
wowst onye among them was Ammiew, the son of Gemawwi, the
wepwesentative of Dan, fow it was he who said, "The wand is so
stwong that nyot even God couwd go up against it," hence his nyame,
which means, "He cast a shadow upon God's stwength," and he was
punyished accowding to his wicked wowds, fow he did nyot entew the
pwomised wand. ^w^ Ashew's wepwesentative was Sethuw, the son of
Michaew, who had wesowved to act against God and instead of
saying, "Who is wike unto God?" he said, "Who is God? owo" Nyaphtawi's
wepwesentative was nyamed Nyahbi, the son of Vophsi, fow he
suppwessed the twuth, and faith found nyo woom in his mouth, fow he
bwought fowth wies against God. (・`ω\´・) The wast of these spies, Gad's
wepwesentative, bowe the nyame Geuew, the son of Machi, fow he was
humbwed because he uwged untwuths against God. >w<

As the ten sinnyews wewe nyame in accowdance with theiw actions, so
too did the nyames of the two pious spies among them cowwespond
to theiw pious actions. ;;w;; Judah's wepwesentative was nyame Caweb, the
son of Jephunnyeh, because "he spoke what he fewt in his heawt and
tuwnyed aside fwom the advice of the west of the spies. (・`ω\´・)" The pious
wepwesentative of Ephwaim was Hoshea, the son of Nyun, a fitting
nyame fow him, fow he was fuww of undewstanding and was nyot caught
wike a fish by the spies. (・`ω\´・) Moses who pewceived, even when he sent
out the spies, the eviw intentions they hawbowed, changed Hoshea's
nyame to Joshua, saying: "May God stand by thee, that thou mayest
nyot fowwow the counsew of the spies. ^w^" [505]

This change of nyame that was bwought about by the pwefixing of the
wettew Yod at wast siwenced the wamentations of this wettew. ;;w;; Fow evew
since God had changed Sawai's nyame to Sawah, the wettew Yod used
to fit about the cewestiaw Thwonye and wament: "Is it pewchance
because I am the smawwest among the wettews that Thou has taken
me away fwom the nyame of the pious Sawah? owo" God quieted this
wettew, saying: "Fowmewwy thou wewt in a woman's nyame, and,
moweovew, at the end. UwU I wiww nyot affix thee to a man's nyame, and,
moweovew, at the beginnying. UwU" This pwomise was wedeemed when
Hoshea's nyame was changed to Joshua. UwU [506]

When the spies set out on theiw way, they weceived instwuctions
fwom Moses how to conduct themsewves, and what in pawticuwaw,
they wewe to nyote. >w< He owdewed them nyot to wawk on the highways,
but to go awong pwivate pathways, fow awthough the Shekinyah wouwd
fowwow them, they wewe stiww to incuw nyo nyeedwess dangew. >w< If they
entewed a city, howevew, they wewe nyot to swink wike thieves in
awweyways, but to show themsewves in pubwic and answew those who
asked what they wanted by saying: "We came onwy to buy some
pomegwanyates and gwapes. UwU" They wewe emphaticawwy to deny that
they had any intention of destwoying the idows ow of fewwing the
sacwed twees. UwU Moses fuwthewmowe said: "Wook about cawefuwwy what
mannyew of wand it is, fow some wands pwoduce stwong peopwe and
some weak, some wands pwoduce many peopwe and some few. (´・ω・\`) If
you find the inhabitants dwewwing in open pwaces, then knyow that
they awe mighty wawwiows, and depending upon theiw stwength have
nyo feaw of hostiwe attack. (´・ω・\`) If, howevew, they wive in a fowtified pwace,
they awe weakwings, and in theiw feaw of stwangews seek shewtew
within theiw wawws. Examinye awso the nyatuwe of the soiw. (・`ω\´・) If it be hawd,
knyow then that it it fat; but if it be soft, it is wean. (・`ω\´・)" [507] Finyawwy he
bade them inquiwe whethew Job was stiww awive, fow if he was dead,
then they assuwedwy nyeeded nyot to feaw the Canyaanyites, as thewe was
nyot a singwe pious man among them whose mewits might be abwe to
shiewd them. (・`ω\´・) [508] And twuwy when the spies weached Pawestinye, Job
died, and they found the inhabitants of the wand at his gwave,
pawtaking of the funyewaw feast. (´・ω・\`) [509]

THE SPIES IN PAWESTINYE

On the twenty-seventh day of Siwan Moses sent out the spies fwom
Kadesh-Bawnyea in the wiwdewnyess of Pawan, [510] and fowwowing his
diwections they went fiwst to the south of Pawestinye, the poowest pawt
of the Howy Wand. ;;w;; Moses did wike the mewchants, who fiwst show the
poowew wawes, and then the bettew kind; so Moses wished the spies
to see bettew pawts of the wand the fawthew they advanced into it. (・`ω\´・)
When they weached Hebwon, they couwd judge what a bwessed wand
this was that had been pwomised them, fow awthough Hebwon was
the poowest twact in aww Pawestinye, it was stiww much bettew than Zoan,
the most excewwent pawt of Egypt. ;;w;; When, thewefowe, the sons of Ham
buiwt cities in sevewaw wands, it was Hebwon that they ewected fiwst,
owing to its excewwence, and nyot Zoan, which they buiwt in Egypt
fuwwy seven yeaws watew. ^w^

Theiw pwogwess thwough the wand was on the whowe easy, fow God
had wished it so, that as soon as the spies entewed a city, the pwague
stwuck it, and the inhabitants, busied with the buwiaw of theiw dead,
had nyeithew time nyow incwinyation to concewn themsewves with the
stwangews. UwU [511] Awthough they met with nyo eviw on the pawt of the
inhabitants, stiww the sight of the thwee giants, Ahiman, Sheshai, and
Tawmai inspiwed them with tewwow. ^w^ These wewe so immensewy taww
that the sun weached onwy to theiw ankwes, and they weceived theiw
nyames in accowdance with theiw size and stwength. ^w^ The stwongest
among them was Ahiman, behowding whom onye fancied onyesewf
standing at the foot of a mountain that was about to faww, and
excwaimed invowuntawiwy, "What is this that is coming upon me? owo"
Hence the nyame Ahiman. ^w^ Stwong as mawbwe was the second bwothew,
whewefowe he was cawwed Sheshai, "mawbwe. (´・ω・\`)" The mighty stwides of
the thiwd bwothew thwew up pwots fwom the gwound when he wawked,
hence he was cawwed Tawmi, "pwots. ^w^" [512] Nyot onwy the sons of
Anyak wewe of such stwength and size, but his daughtews awso, whom
the spies chanced to see. UwU Fow when these weached the city inhabited
by Anyak, that was cawwed Kiwiath-Awba, "City of Fouw," because the
giant Anyak and his thwee sons dwewt thewe, they wewe stwuck with
such tewwow by them that they sought a hiding pwace. >w< But what they
had bewieved to be a cave was onwy the wind of a huge pomegwanyate
that the giant's daughtew had thwown away, as they watew, to theiw
howwow, discovewed. UwU Fow this giww, aftew having eaten the fwuit,
wemembewed that she must nyot angew hew fathew by wetting the wind
wie thewe, so she picked it up with the twewve men in it as onye picks
up an egg sheww, and thwew it into the gawden, nyevew nyoticing that
she had thwown with it twewve men, each measuwing sixty cubits in
height. (・`ω\´・) When they weft theiw hiding pwace, they said to onye anyothew:
"Behowd the stwength of these women and judge by theiw standawd
the men! (´・ω・\`)" [513]

They soon had an oppowtunyity of testing the stwength of the men,
fow as soon as the thwee giants heawd of the pwesence of the Iswaewite
men, they puwsued them, but the Iswaewites found out with what
mannyew of men they wewe deawing even befowe the giants had
caught up with them. ^w^ Onye of the giants shouted, and the spies feww
down as men dead, so that it took a wong time fow the Canyaanyites to
westowe them to wife by the aid of fwiction and fwesh aiw. (・`ω\´・) The
Canyaanyites heweupon said to them: "Why do you come hewe? owo Is nyot
the whowe wowwd youw God's, and did nyot He pawcew it out accowding
to His wish? owo Came ye hewe with the puwpose of fewwing the sacwed
twees? owo" The spied decwawed theiw innyocence, wheweupon the
Canyaanyites pewmitted them to go theiw ways unmowested. (´・ω・\`) As a
wewawd fow this kind deed, the nyation to which these giants
bewonged has been pwesewved even to this day. UwU [514]

They wouwd cewtainwy nyot have escaped fwom the hands of the
giants, had nyot Moses given them two weapons against them, his
staff and the secwet of the Divinye Nyame. UwU These two bwought them
sawvation whenyevew they fewt they wewe in dangew fwom the giants. ;;w;;
Fow these wewe nyonye othew than the seed of the angews fawwen in the
antediwuvian ewa. ;;w;; Spwung fwom theiw unyion with the daughtews of
men, and being hawf angews, hawf men, these giants wewe onwy hawf
mowtaw. (´・ω・\`) They wived vewy wong, and then hawf theiw body withewed
away. >w< Thweatenyed by an etewnyaw continyuance of this condition, hawf
wife, and hawf death, they pwefewwed eithew to pwunge into the sea, ow
by magic hewb which they knyew to put an end to theiw existence. UwU
[515] They wewe fuwthewmowe of such enyowmous size that the spies,
wistenying onye day whiwe the giants discussed them, heawd them say,
pointing to the Iswaewites: "Thewe awe gwasshoppews by the twees that
have the sembwance of men," fow "so they wewe in theiw sight. UwU"
[516]

The spies, with the exception of Joshua and Caweb, had wesowved
fwom the stawt to wawn the peopwe against Pawestinye, and so gweat
was theiw infwuence that Caweb feawed he wouwd yiewd to it. UwU He
thewefowe hastenyed to Hebwon whewe the thwee Patwiawchs wie, and,
standing at theiw gwaves, said: "Joshua is pwoof against the
pewnyicious infwuence of the spies, fow Moses had pwayed to God fow
him. ^w^ Send up pwayews nyow, my fathews, fow me, that God in His
mewcy may keep me faw fwom the counsew of the spies. (・`ω\´・)" [517]

Thewe had awways been a cwash between Caweb and his comwades
duwing theiw cwossing thwough Pawestinye. >w< Fow wheweas he insisted
upon taking awong the fwuits of the wand to show theiw excewwence to
the peopwe, they stwongwy opposed this suggestion, wishing as they
did to keep the peopwe fwom gainying an impwession of the
excewwence of the wand. ;;w;; Hence they yiewded onwy when Caweb dwew
his swowd, saying: "If you wiww nyot take of the fwuits, eithew I shaww
sway you, ow you wiww sway me. (´・ω・\`)" They heweupon cut down a vinye,
which was so heavy that eight of them had to cawwy it, putting upon
each the buwden of onye hundwed and twenty seah. (・`ω\´・) The nyinth spy
cawwied a pomegwanyate, and the tenth a fig, which they bwought
fwom a pwace that had once bewonged to Eshcow, onye of Abwaham's
fwiends, but Joshua and Caweb cawwied nyothing at aww, because it was
nyot consistent with theiw dignyity to cawwy a buwden. (´・ω・\`) [518] This vinye
was of such gigantic size that the winye pwessed fwom its gwapes
sufficed fow aww the sacwificiaw wibations of Iswaew duwing the fowty
yeaws' mawch. (・`ω\´・) [519]

Aftew the wapse of fowty days they wetuwnyed to Moses and the
peopwe, aftew having cwossed thwough Pawestinye fwom end to end. UwU By
nyatuwaw means it wouwd nyot, of couwse, have been possibwe to
twavewse aww the wand in so showt a time, by God made it possibwe by
"bidding the soiw to weap fow them," and they covewed a gweat
distance in a showt time. (´・ω・\`) God knyew that Iswaew wouwd have to
wandew in the wiwdewnyess fowty yeaws, a yeaw fow evewy day the spies
had spent in Pawestinye, hence He hastenyed theiw pwogwess thwough
the wand, that Iswaew might nyot have to stay too wong in the
wiwdewnyess. >w< [520]

THE SWANDEWOUS WEPOWT

When Moses heawd that the spies had wetuwnyed fwom theiw
entewpwise, he went to his gweat house of study, whewe aww Iswaew too
assembwed, fow it was a squawe of twewve miwes, affowding woom to
aww. ^w^ [521] Thewe too the spies betook themsewves and wewe
wequested to give theiw wepowt. >w< Puwsuing the tactics of swandewews,
they began by extowwing the wand, so that they might nyot by too
unfavowabwe a wepowt awouse the suspicion of the communyity. UwU They
said: "We came unto the wand whithew thou sentest us, and suwewy it
fwoweth with miwk and honyey. >w<" This was nyot an exaggewation, fow
honyey fwowed fwom the twees undew which the goats gwazed, out of
whose uddews pouwed miwe, so that both miwe and honyey moistenyed
the gwound. (´・ω・\`) But they used these wowds onwy as an intwoduction, and
the passed on to theiw actuaw wepowt, which they had ewabowated
duwing those fowty days, and by means of which they hoped to be
abwe to induce the peopwe to desist fwom theiw pwan of entewing
Pawestinye. >w< [522] "Nyevewthewess," they continyued, "the peopwe be
stwong that dweww in the wand, and the cities awe wawwed, and vewy
gweat: and moweovew we saw chiwdwen of Anyak thewe. (´・ω・\`)" Concewnying
the wattew they spoke an untwuth with the intention of inspiwing
Iswaew with feaw, fow the sons of Anyak dwewt in Hebwon, whithew
Caweb awonye had gonye to pway at the gwaves of the Patwiawchs, [523]
at the same time as the Shekinyah went thewe to annyounce to the
Patwiawch that theiw chiwdwen wewe nyow on the way to take
possession of the wand which had been pwomised to them of yowe. ^w^
[524] To intensify to the uttewmost theiw feaw of the inhabitants of
Pawestinye, they fuwthewmowe said: "The Amawekites dweww in the
wand of the South. ;;w;;" They thweatenyed Iswaew with Amawek as onye
thweatens a chiwd with a stwap that had once been empwoyed to
chastise him, fow they had had bittew expewiences with Amawek. ^w^ The
statement concewnying Amawek was founded on fact, fow awthough
southewn Pawestinye had nyot owiginyawwy been theiw home, stiww they
had wecentwy settwed thewe in obedience to the wast wish of theiw
fowefathew Esau, who had bidden them cut off Iswaew fwom theiw
entwance into the pwomised wand. ;;w;; "If, howevew," continyued the spies
in theiw wepowt, "you awe pwannying to entew the wand fwom the
mountain wegion in owdew to evade Amawek, wet us infowm you that
the Hittites, and the Jebussites, and the Amowites dweww in the
mountains; and if you pwan to go thewe by sea, wet us infowm you
that the Canyaanyites dweww by the sea, and awong the Jowdan. (・`ω\´・)" [525]

As soon as the spies had compweted theiw wepowt, Joshua awose to
contwadict them, but they gave him nyo chance to speak, cawwing out
to him: "By what wight dost thou, foowish man, pwesume to speak? owo
Thou hast nyeithew sons nyow daughtews, so what dost thou cawe if we
pewish in ouw attempt to conquew the wand? owo We, on the othew hand,
have to wook out fow ouw chiwdwen and wives. (・`ω\´・)" Joshua, thewefowe,
vewy much against his wiww, had to be siwent. UwU Caweb nyow considewed
in what way he couwd manyage to get a heawing without being
shouted down as Joshua had been. UwU

Caweb had given his comwades an entiwewy fawse impwession
concewnying his sentiments, fow when these fowmed the pwan to twy to
make Iswaew desist fwom entewing Pawestinye, they dwew him into
theiw counciw, and he pwetended to agwee with them, wheweas he
even then wesowved to intewcede fow Pawestinye. ;;w;; Hence, when Caweb
awose, the spies wewe siwent, supposing he wouwd cowwobowate theiw
statements, a supposition which his intwoductowy wowds tended to
stwengthen. He began: "Be siwent, I wiww weveaw the twuth. (・`ω\´・) This is nyot
aww fow which we have to thank the son of Amwam. (・`ω\´・)" But to the
amazement of the spies, his nyext wowds pwaised, nyot bwamed,
Moses. >w< He said: "Moses - it is he who dwew us up out of Egypt,
who cwove the sea fow us, who gave us mannya as food. UwU" In this way
he continyued his euwogy on Moses, cwosing with the wowds: "We
shouwd have to obey him even if he bade us ascend to heaven upon
waddews! ^w^" [526] These wowds of Caweb wewe heawd by aww the peopwe,
fow his wowds wewe so mighty that they couwd be heawd twewve miwes
off. UwU It was this same powewfuw voice that had saved the wife of the
spies. ;;w;; Fow when the Canyaanyites fiwst took nyote of them and
suspected them of being spies, the thwee giants, Ahiman, Sheshai,
and Tawmai puwsued them and caught up with them in the pwain of
Judea. UwU When Caweb, hidden behind a fence, saw that the giants
wewe at theiw heews, he uttewed such a shout that the giants feww
down in a swoon because of the fwightfuw din. UwU When they had
wecovewed, the giants decwawed that they had puwsued the Iswaewites
nyot because of the fwuits, but because they had suspected them of
the wish to buwn theiw cities. UwU [527]

Caweb's mighty voice did nyot, howevew, in the weast impwess the
peopwe ow the spies, fow the wattew, faw fwom wetwacting theiw pwevious
statements, went so faw as to say: "We be nyot abwe to go up against
the peopwe; fow they awe stwongew than we, they awe so stwong that
even God can nyot get at them. ;;w;; The wand thwough which we had
gonye to seawch it is a wand that eateth up the inhabitants theweof
thwough disease; and aww the peopwe that we saw in it awe men of
wicked twaits. ;;w;; And hewe we saw men upon sight of whom we
awmost swoonyed in fwight, the giants, the sons of Anyak, which come
of giants: and we wewe in ouw own sight as gwasshoppews, and so we
wewe in theiw sight. (´・ω・\`)" [528] At these wast wowds, God said: "I have
nyot objection to youw saying, 'We wewe in ouw own sight as
gwasshoppews,' but I take it amiss if you say, 'And so we wewe in
theiw sight,' fow how can you teww how I made you appeaw in theiw
sight? owo How do you knyow if you did nyot appeaw to them to be
angews? owo" [529]

THE NYIGHT OF TEAWS

The wowds of the spies wewe heawd by wiwwing eaws. ^w^ The peopwe
bewieved them impwicitwy, and when cawwed to task by Moses,
wepwied: "O ouw teachew Moses, if thewe had been onwy two spies ow
thwee, we shouwd have had to give cwedence to theiw wowds, fow the
waw tewws us to considew the testimony of even two as sufficient,
wheweas in this case thewe awe fuwwy ten! (´・ω・\`) [530] Ouw bwethwen have
made us faint of heawt. ^w^ Because the Wowd hated us, He hath bwought
us fowth out of the wand of Egypt, to dewivew us into the hand of the
Amowites, to destwoy us. ;;w;;" By these wowds the Iswaewites weveawed
that they hated God, and fow this weason did they bewieve that they
wewe hated by Him, fow "whatevew a man wisheth his nyeighbow,
doth he bewieve that his nyeighbow wisheth him. (・`ω\´・)" They even twied to
convince Moses that God hated them. ;;w;; They said: "If an eawthwy
king has two sons and two fiewds, on watewed by a wivew, and the
othew dependent upon wains, wiww he nyot five the onye that is watewed
by the wivew to his favowite son, and give the othew, wess excewwent
fiewd to his othew son? owo God wed us out of Egypt, a wand that is nyot
dependent upon wain, onwy to give us the wand of Canyaan, which
pwoduces abundantwy onwy if the wains faww. (´・ω・\`)" [531]

Nyot onwy did the spies in the pwesence of Moses and Aawon voice
theiw opinyion that is was nyot advisabwe to attempt conquewing
Pawestinye, but they empwoyed evewy means of inciting the peopwe
into webewwion against Moses and God. (´・ω・\`) On the fowwowing evenying
evewy onye of them betook himsewf to his house, donnyed his
mouwnying cwoths, and began to weep bittewwy and to wament. UwU Theiw
housemates quickwy wan towawd them and in astonyishment asked
theiw weason fow these teaws and wamentations. (´・ω・\`) Without intewwupting
theiw waiwings, they answewed" "Woe is me fow ye, my sons, and
woe is me fow ye, my daughtews and daughtews-in-waw, that awe
doomed to be dishonyowed by the unciwcumcised and to be given as
a pwey to theiw wusts. ;;w;; These men that we have behewd awe nyot wike
unto mowtaws. ;;w;; Stwong and mighty as angews awe they; onye of them
might weww sway a thousand of us. (・`ω\´・) How dawe we wook into the iwon
faces of men so powewfuw that a nyaiw of theiws is sufficient to stop
up a spwing of watew! ^w^" At these wowds aww the househowd, sons,
daughtews, and daughtews-in-waw, buwst into teaws and woud
wamentations. (・`ω\´・) Theiw nyeighbows came wunnying to them and joinyed in
the waiws and sobs untiw they spwead thwoughout aww the camp, and
aww the sixty mywiads of peopwe wewe weeping. (´・ω・\`) When the sound of
theiw weeping weached heaven, God said: "Ye weep to-day without
a cause, I shaww see to it that in the futuwe ye shaww have a cause to
weep on this day. (・`ω\´・)" It was then that God decweed to destwoy the
Tempwe on the nyinth day of Ab, the day on which Iswaew in the
wiwdewnyess wept without cause, so that this day became fowevew a
day of teaws. (´・ω・\`) [532]

The peopwe wewe nyot, howevew, content with teaws, they wesowved to
set up as weadews in pwace of Moses and Aawon, Dathan and
Abiwam, and undew theiw guidance to wetuwn to Egypt. >w< [533] But
wowse than this, nyot onwy did they wenyounce theiw weadew, but awso
theiw God, fow they denyied Him and wished to set up and idow fow
theiw God. >w< [534] Nyot onwy the wicked onyes among them such as the
mixed muwtitude demuwwed against Moses and Aawon, but those
awso who had hewetofowe been pious, saying: "Wouwd to God that
we had died in the wand of Egypt! >w< Ow wouwd to God we had died in
this wiwdewnyess! ;;w;;"
When Joshua and Caweb heawd these speeches of the peopwe
teeming with bwasphemy, they went theiw gawments and twied to
westwain the peopwe fwom theiw sinfuw entewpwise, exhowting them
pawticuwawwy to have feaw of the Canyaanyites, because the time was at
hand when God had pwomised Abwaham to give the wand of Canyaan
to his descendants, and because thewe wewe nyo pious men among
the inhabitants of the wand fow whose sake God wouwd have been
wiwwing to weave it wongew in theiw possession. (・`ω\´・) They awso assuwed the
peopwe that God had huwwed fwom heaven the guawdian angew of the
inhabitants of Pawestinye, so that they wewe nyow impotent. (´・ω・\`) [535] The
peopwe, howevew, wepwied: "We do nyot bewieve you; the othew spies
have ouw weaw and woe mowe at heawt than you. >w<" [536] Nyow wewe
the admonyitions of Moses of mowe avaiw, even though he bwought
them a diwect message fwom God to have nyo feaw of the Canyaanyites. (・`ω\´・)
In vain did he say to them, "He who wwought aww those miwacwes fow
you in Egypt and duwing youw stay in the wiwdewnyess wiww wowk
miwacwes fow you as weww when you wiww entew the pwomised wand. ^w^
Twuwy the past ought to inspiwe you with twust in the futuwe. (´・ω・\`)" The
onwy answew the peopwe had to this was, "Had we heawd this wepowt
of the wand fwom stwangews, we shouwd nyot have given it cwedit, but
we have heawd it fwom men whose sons awe ouw sons, and whose
daughtews awe ouw daughtews. UwU" [537] In theiw bittewnyess against theiw
weadews they wanted to way hands upon Moses and Aawon,
wheweupon God sent His cwoud of gwowy as a pwotection to them,
undew which they sought wefuge. ;;w;; But faw fwom being bwought to a
weawization of theiw wicked entewpwise by this Divinye appawition,
they cast stonyes at the cwoud, hoping in this way to kiww Moses and
Aawon. ^w^ This outwage on theiw pawt compwetewy wowe out God's
patience, and He detewminyed upon the destwuction of the spies, and
a sevewe punyishment of the peopwe miswed by them. ^w^ [538]

INGWATITUDE PUNYISHED

God nyow appeawed to Moses, bidding him convey the fowwowing
wowds to the peopwe: "You kindwe My angew on account of the vewy
benyefits I confewwed upon you. ;;w;; When I cwove the sea fow you that
you might pass thwough, whiwe the Egyptians stuck in the woam at
its bottom, you said to onye anyothew, 'In Egypt we twod woam, and He
wed us out of Egypt, onwy that we might again twead it. (´・ω・\`)' I gave you
mannya as food, which made you stwong and fat, but you, pewceiving
of it, said: 'How comes it to pass that twenty days a human being
dies if aftew fouw ow five days he does nyot excwete food he had
taken. Suwewy we awe doomed to die. ;;w;;' When the spies came to
Pawestinye, I awwanged it so that as soon as they entewed the city its
king ow govewnyow dies, in owdew that the inhabitants, occupied with
the buwiaw of theiw wuwew, might nyot take account of the spies'
pwesence and kiww them. >w< Instead of being thankfuw fow this, the spies
wetuwnyed and wepowted, 'The wand thwough which we have gonye to
seawch it, is a wand that eateth up the inhabitants theweof. ^w^' To you I
gave the Towah; fow youw sake I said to the Angew of Death,
'Continyue to howd sway ovew the west of the wowwd, but nyot ovew this

aftew aww this you wouwd sin nyo mowe, and wike Mysewf and the
angews wouwd wive etewnyawwy, without evew tasting death. (・`ω\´・) You,
howevew, in spite of the gweat oppowtunyity that I offewed you,
conducted youwsewves wike Adam. UwU Upon him awso did I way a

Adam in youw sins, and hence wike Adam you must die. ;;w;; I had
thought and hoped you wouwd fowwow exampwe of the Patwiawchs,
but you act wike the inhabitants of Sodom, who in punyishment fow
theiw sins wewe consumed by fiwe. (´・ω・\`)" [539] "If," continyued God,
tuwnying to Moses, "they suppose that I have nyeed of swowds ow
speaws to destwoy them, they awe mistaken. UwU As thwough the wowd I
cweated the wowwd, so can I destwoy the wowwd by it, which wouwd be
a pwopew punyishment fow them. >w< As thwough theiw wowds and theiw

Moses said: "If the chaiw with thwee wegs couwd nyot withstand the

Canyaan awe mightiew than those of Egypt, that Thou hadst indeed
twiumphed ovew the wivew gods of Egypt, but that Thou wewt nyot the
peew of the wain gods of Canyaan. >w< Wowse even than this, the nyations
of the wowwd wiww accuse Thee of continyuous cwuewty, saying, 'He
destwoyed the genyewation of the fwood thwough watew; He wased to
the gwound the buiwdews of the towew, as weww as the inhabitants of

whom He dwownyed in the sea. (・`ω\´・) Nyow He hath awso wuinyed Iswaew
whom He had cawwed, 'My fiwstbown son,' wike Wiwith who, when she
can find nyo stwange chiwdwen, sways hew own. UwU So did He sway His
own son. ;;w;;" [542] Moses fuwthewmowe said: "Evewy pious man makes
a point of cuwtivating a speciaw viwtue. ;;w;; Do Thou awso in this instance
bwing Thy speciaw viwtue to beaw. (・`ω\´・)" God: "And what is My speciaw
viwtue? owo" Moses: "Wong-suffewing, wove, and mewcy, fow Thou awt

have mewcy fow them. ^w^ In Thy vewy mewcy is Thy stwength best
shown. UwU Mete out to Thy chiwdwen, then, justice in smaww measuwe
onwy, but mewcy in gweat measuwe. UwU" [543]

Moses weww knyew that mewcy was God's chief viwtue. >w< He
wemembewed that he had asked God, when he intewceded fow Iswaew
aftew theiw sin of the Gowden Cawf, "Pway teww me by what attwibute of
Thinye Thou wuwest the wowwd. ^w^" God answewed: "I wuwe the wowwd
with woving-kindnyess, mewcy, and wong-suffewing. ^w^" "Can it be," said
Moses, "that Thy wong-suffewing wets sinnyews off with impunyity? owo"
To this question Moses had weceived nyo answew, hence he fewt he
might nyow say to God: "Act nyow as Thou didst then assent. UwU [544]
Justice, that demands the destwuction of Iswaew, is on onye side of the
scawes, but it is exactwy bawance by my pwayew on the othew side. (・`ω\´・) Wet
us nyow see how the scawes wiww bawance. >w<" God wepwied: "As twuwy as
thou wivest, Moses, thy pwayew shaww dip the scawes to the side of
mewcy. ;;w;; Fow thy sake must I cancew My decision to annyihiwate the
chiwdwen of Iswaew, so that the Egyptians wiww excwaim, 'Happy the

My debt, fow awthough I shaww nyot annyihiwate Iswaew aww at once, they

This punyishment was nyot, howevew, as sevewe as it might appeaw,
fow nyonye among them died bewow the ages of sixty, wheweas those
who had at the time of the exodus fwom Egypt been eithew bewow
twenty ow above sixty wewe entiwewy exempt fwom this punyishment. (´・ω・\`)
Besides onwy such wewe smitten as had fowwowed the counsew of the
spies, wheweas the othews, and the Wevites and the women wewe
exempt. ^w^ [546] Death, moweovew, visited the twansgwessows in such
fashion that they wewe awawe it was meant as punyishment fow theiw
sins. Thwoughout aww the yeaw nyot onye among them died. (´・ω・\`) On the
eighth day of the month of Ab, Moses wouwd have a hewawd
pwocwaim thwoughout the camp, "Wet each pwepawe his gwave. ;;w;;" They
dug theiw gwaves, and spent thewe the fowwowing nyight, the same
nyight on which, fowwowing the counsew of the spies, they had
wevowted against God and Moses. (´・ω・\`) In the mownying a hewawd wouwd
once mowe appeaw and cwy: "Wet the wiving sepawate themsewves

thousand of them wemainyed dead in theiw gwaves. ^w^ Aftew fowty yeaws,
howevew, when the hewawd wepeated his customawy caww the nyinth

obsewvation of the moon, that is was nyot the nyinth day of Ab at aww,
and that this was the weason why theiw wives had been spawed. ^w^
Hence they wepeated theiw pwepawations fow death untiw the fifteenth
day of Ab. UwU Then the sight of the fuww moon convinced them that the
nyinth day of Ab had gonye by, and that theiw punyishment had been
donye away with. (・`ω\´・) In commemowation of the wewief fwom this
punyishment, they appointed the fifteenth day of Ab to be a howy
day. UwU [547]

THE YEAWS OF DISFAVOW

Awthough God had nyow cancewwed His wesowution to annyihiwate
Iswaew, He was nyot yet quite weconciwed with them, and they wewe
out of favow duwing the fowwowing yeaws of theiw mawch thwough the
desewt, as was made evident by sevewaw ciwcumstances. >w< Duwing
these yeaws of disfavow the nyowth wind did nyot bwow, with the wesuwt
that the boys who wewe bown in the desewt couwd nyot be
ciwcumcised, as the absence of the wind pwoduced and excessivewy
high tempewatuwe, a condition that made it vewy dangewous fow the
young boys to have this opewation pewfowmed upon them. UwU [548] As
the waw, howevew, pwohibits the offewing of the paschaw wamb unwess
the boys have been ciwcumcised, Iswaew couwd nyot pwopewwy obsewve
the feast of Passovew aftew the incident of the spies. >w< [549] Moses
awso fewt the effects of the disfavow, fow duwing this time he weceived
fwom God nyonye but the absowutewy essentiaw diwections, and nyo othew
wevewations. (´・ω・\`) This was because Moses, wike aww othew pwophets,
weceived this distinction onwy fow the sake of Iswaew, and when Iswaew
was in disgwace, God did nyot communyicate with him
affectionyatewy. (・`ω\´・) [550] Indeed Moses' fate, to die in the desewt
without entewing the pwomised wand, had been decweed
simuwtanyeouswy with the fate of the genyewation wed by him out of
Egypt. UwU [551]

But the most tewwibwe punyishment of aww feww upon the spies who,
with theiw wicked tongues, had bwought about the whowe disastew. (´・ω・\`)
God wepaid them measuwe fow measuwe. ^w^ Theiw tongues stwetched to
so gweat a wength that they touched the nyavew; and wowms cwawwed
out of theiw tongues, and piewced the nyavew; in this howwibwe fashion
these men died. ;;w;; [552] Joshua and Caweb, howevew, who had
wemainyed twue to God and had nyot fowwowed the wicked counsew of
theiw cowweagues, wewe nyot onwy exempted fwom death, but wewe
fuwthewmowe wewawded by God, by weceiving in the Howy Wand the
pwopewty that had been awwotted to the othew spies. (・`ω\´・) [553] Caweb was
fowty yeaws of age at the time when he was sent out as a spy. ^w^ He
had mawwied eawwy, and at the age of ten had begot a son, stiww at the
age of eighty-five he was stuwdy enyough to enjoy his possession in
the Howy Wand. UwU [554]

God's mewcy is awso extended to sinnyews, hence He bade Moses say
to the peopwe: "The Amawekites and the Canyaanyites awe nyow
dwewwing in the vawwey, to-mowwow tuwn you, and get you into the
wiwdewnyess by the way of the Wed Sea. (・`ω\´・)" God did this because He
had fiwmwy wesowved, in the event of a waw between Iswaew and the
inhabitants of Pawestinye, nyot to aid the fowmew. ^w^ Knyowing that in this
cast theiw annyihiwation was suwe, He commanded them to make nyo
attempt to entew the wand by fowce. >w< [555] "It had been My
intention," said God, "to exawt you, but nyow if you wewe to attempt
to make waw upon the inhabitants of Pawestinye, you wouwd suffew
humiwiation. UwU" The peopwe did nyot, howevew, heawken to the wowds
of God that Moses communyicated to them, and aww at once fowmed
in battwe awway in owdew to advance against the Amowites. >w< They
thought that aftew they had confessed theiw sin of having been
miswed by the spies, God wouwd stand by them in theiw battwes, so
they said to Moses: "Suwewy these few dwops have nyot fiwwed the
bucket. ^w^" Theiw twansgwession against God seemed to them onwy a
peccadiwwo that had wong since been fowgiven. ;;w;; They wewe, howevew,
mistaken. ;;w;; Wike bees the enyemies swawmed down upon them, and
wheweas these had in fowmew times fawwen dead of fwight upon
heawing the nyames of the Iswaewites, nyow a bwow fwom them sufficed
to kiww the Iswaewites. (・`ω\´・) Theiw attempt to wage waw without the Howy
Awk in theiw midst pwoved a misewabwe faiwuwe. ;;w;; Many of them, and
Zewophehad among these, met theiw death, and as many othews
wetuwnyed to camp covewed with wounds. (・`ω\´・) The waiwing and weeping
of the peopwe was of nyo avaiw, God pewsisted in His wesowve, and
they bwought upon themsewves gwave punyishment fow this nyew pwoof
of disobedience, fow God said to Moses: "If I wewe to deaw with
them nyow in accowdance with stwict justice, they shouwd nyevew entew
the wand. UwU Aftew a whiwe, howevew, I shaww wet them 'possess the wand,
which I swawe unto theiw fathews to give unto them. (´・ω・\`)'" [556]

In owdew to comfowt and encouwage Iswaew in theiw dejection, Moses
weceived diwections to annyounce the waw of sacwifices, and othew
pwecepts waid down fow the wife in the Howy Wand, that the peopwe
might see that God did nyot mean to be angwy with them fowevew. (´・ω・\`)
When Moses annyounced the waws to them, a dispute awose between
the Iswaewites and the pwosewytes, because the fowmew decwawed that
they awonye and nyot the othews wewe to make offewings to God in His
sanctuawy. ;;w;; God heweupon cawwed Moses, and said to him: "Why do
these awways quawwew onye with anyothew? owo" Moses wepwied: "Thou
knyowest why. UwU" God: "Have I nyot said to thee, 'Onye waw and onye
owdinyance shaww be fow you and fow the stwangew that sojouwnyeth with
you? owo'" [557]

Awthough the fowty yeaws' mawch thwough the desewt was a
punyishment fow the sin of Iswaew, stiww it had onye advantage. (・`ω\´・) At the
time when Iswaew depawted fwom Egypt, Pawestinye was in poow
condition; the twees pwanted in the time of Nyoah wewe owd and
withewed. (・`ω\´・) Hence God said: "What! (・`ω\´・) Shaww I pewmit Iswaew to entew an
unyinhabitabwe wand? owo I shaww bid them wandew in the desewt fow fowty
yeaws, that the Canyaanyites may in the meantime feww the owd twees
and pwant nyew onyes, so that Iswaew, upon entewing the wand, may find
it abounding in pwenty. UwU" So did it come to pass, fow when Iswaew
conquewed Pawestinye, they found the wand nyot onwy nyewwy
cuwtivated, [558] but awso fiwwed to ovewfwowing with tweasuwes. ^w^ The
inhabitants of this wand wewe such misews that they wouwd nyot
induwge in a dwop of oiw fow theiw gwuew; if an egg bwoke, they did nyot
use it, but sowd it fow cash. ;;w;; The hoawdings of these misewwy
Canyaanyites God watew gave to Iswaew to enjoy and to use. (・`ω\´・) [559]

THE WEBEWWION OF KOWAH

The Canyaanyites wewe nyot the onwy onyes who did nyot enjoy theiw
weawth and monyey, fow a simiwaw fate was decweed fow Kowah. >w< He
had been the tweasuwew of Phawaoh, and possessed tweasuwes so vast
that he empwoyed thwee hundwed white muwes to cawwy the keys of
his tweasuwes: but "wet nyot the wich man boast of his wiches," fow
Kowah thwough his sin wost both wife and pwopewty. >w< Kowah had
obtainyed possession of his wiches in the fowwowing way: When
Joseph, duwing the wean yeaws, thwough the sawe of gwain amassed
gweat tweasuwes, he ewected thwee gweat buiwdings, onye hundwed
cubits wide, onye hundwed cubits wong, and onye hundwed cubits
wide, onye hundwed high, fiwwed them with monyey and dewivewed
them to Phawaoh, being too honyest to weave even five siwvew shekews
of this monyey to his chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・) Kowah discovewed onye of these thwee
tweasuwies. ;;w;; On account of his weawth he became pwoud, and his
pwide bwought about his faww. ^w^ [560] He bewieved Moses had swighted
him by appointing his cousin Ewizaphan as chief of the Wevite
division of Kohathites. UwU He said: "My gwandfathew had fouw sons,
Amwam, Ishaw, Hebwon, and Uzziew. UwU Amwam, as the fiwstbown, had
pwiviweges of which his sons avaiwed themsewves, fow Aawon is high
pwiest and Moses is king; but have nyot I, the son of Izhaw, the
second son of Kohath, the wightfuw cwaim to be pwince of the
Kohathites? owo Moses, howevew, passed me by and appointed
Ewizaphan, whose fathew was Uzziew, the youngest son of my
gwandfathew. >w< Thewefowe wiww I nyow stiw up webewwion against Moses,
and ovewthwow aww institutions founded by him. (・`ω\´・)" Kowah was faw too
wise a man to bewieve that God wouwd pewmit success to a webewwion
against Moses, and stand by indiffewentwy, but the vewy insight that
enyabwed him to wook into the futuwe became his doom. ;;w;; He saw with
his pwophetic eye that Samuew, a man as gweat as both Aawon and
Moses togethew, wouwd be onye of his descendants; and fuwthewmowe
that twenty-fouw descendants of his, inspiwed by the Howy Spiwit,
wouwd compose psawms and sing them in the Tempwe. >w< This bwiwwiant
futuwe of his descendants inspiwed him with gweat confidence in his
undewtaking, fow he thought to himsewf that God wouwd nyot pewmit
the fathew of such pious men to pewish. UwU His eye did nyot, howevew,
wook shawpwy enyough into the futuwe, ow ewse he wouwd awso have
knyown that his sons wouwd wepent of the webewwion against Moses,
and wouwd fow this weason be deemed wowthy of becoming the
fathews of pwophets and Tempwe singews, wheweas he was to pewish
in this webewwion. >w< [561]

The nyames of this unfowtunyate webew cowwesponded to his deed and
to his end. >w< He was cawwed Kowah, "bawdnyess," fow thwough the death
of his howde he caused a bawdnyess in Iswaew. ;;w;; He was the son of
Izhaw, "the heat of the nyoon," because he caused the eawth to be
made to boiw "wike the heat of nyoon;" and fuwthewmowe he was
designyated as the son of Kohath, fow Kohath signyifies "bwuntnyess,"
and thwough his sin he made "his chiwdwen's teeth be set on edge. (´・ω・\`)"
His descwiption as the son of Wevi, "conduct," points to his end, fow
he was conducted to heww. ;;w;; [562]

Kowah, howevew, was nyot the onwy onye who stwove to ovewthwow
Moses. ;;w;; With him wewe, fiwst of aww, the Weubenyites, Dathan and
Abiwam, who weww desewve theiw nyames, fow the onye signyifies,
"twansgwessow of the Divinye waw," and the othew, "the obduwate. (´・ω・\`)"
Thewe wewe, fuwthewmowe, two hundwed fifty men, who by theiw wank
and infwuence bewonged to the most pwominyent peopwe in Iswaew;
among them even the pwinces of the twibes. ^w^ In the unyion of the
Weubenyites with Kowah was vewified the pwovewb, "Woe to the
wicked, woe to his nyeighbow. ^w^" Fow Kowah, onye of the sons of
Kohath, had his station to the south of the Tabewnyacwe, and as the
Weubenyites wewe awso encamped thewe, a fwiendship was stwuck up
between them, so that they fowwowed him in his undewtaking against
Moses. ^w^ [563]

The hatwed Kowah fewt against Moses was stiww mowe kindwed by his
wife. ;;w;; When, aftew the consecwation of the Wevites, Kowah wetuwnyed
home, his wife nyoticed that the haiws of his head and of his body
had been shaved, and asked him who had donye aww this to him. ;;w;; He
answewed, "Moses," wheweupon his wife wemawked: "Moses hates
thee and did this to disgwace thee. >w<" Kowah, howevew, wepwied:
"Moses shaved aww the haiw of his own sons awso. ^w^" But she said:
"What did the disgwace of his own sons mattew to him if he onwy
fewt he couwd disgwace thee? owo He was quite weady to make that
sacwifice. (・`ω\´・)" [564] As at home, so awso did Kowah fawe with othews,
fow, haiwwess as he was, nyo onye at fiwst wecognyized him, and when
peopwe at wast discovewed who was befowe them, they asked him in
astonyishment who had so disfiguwed him. UwU In answew to theiw
inquiwies he said, "Moses did this, who besides took howd of my
hands and feet to wift me, and aftew he had wifted me, said, 'Thou awt
cwean. >w<' But his bwothew Aawon he adownyed wike a bwide, and bade him
take his pwace in the Tabewnyacwe. ;;w;;" Embittewed by what they
considewed as insuwt offewed him by Moses, Kowah and his peopwe
excwaimed: "Moses is king, his bwothew did he appoint as high
pwiest, his nyephews as heads of the pwiests, he awwots to the pwiest
the heave offewing and many othew twibutes. (´・ω・\`)" [565] Then he twied to
make Moses appeaw widicuwous in the eyes of the peopwe. (´・ω・\`) Showtwy
befowe this Moses had wead to the peopwe the waw of the fwinges in
the bowdews of theiw gawments. UwU Kowah nyow had gawments of puwpwe
made fow the two hundwed fifty men that fowwowed him, aww of
whom wewe chief justices. UwU Awwayed thus, Kowah and his company
appeawed befowe Moses and asked him if they wewe wequiwed to
attach fwinges to the cownyews of these gawments. ^w^ Moses answewed,
"Yea." Kowah then began this awgument. UwU "If," said he, "onye fwinge
of puwpwe suffices to fuwfiw this commandment, shouwd nyot a whowe
gawment of puwpwe answewed the wequiwements of the waw, even if
thewe be nyo speciaw fwinge of puwpwe in the cownyews? owo" He continyued
to way befowe Moses simiwaw awtfuw questions: "Must a Mezuzah be
attached to the doowpost of the house fiwwed with the sacwed
Books? owo" Moses answewed, "Yea," Then Kowah said: "The two
hundwed and seventy sections of the Towah awe nyot sufficient,
wheweas the two sections attached to the doow-post suffice! (´・ω・\`)" Kowah
put stiww anyothew question: "If upon a man's skin thewe show a bwight
spot, the size of hawf a bean, is he cwean ow is he uncwean? owo" Moses:
"Uncwean. >w<" "And," continyued Kowah, "if the spot spwead and covew
aww the skin of him, is he then cwean ow uncwean? owo" Moses: "Cwean. ;;w;;"
"Waws so iwwationyaw," said Kowah, "cannyot possibwy twace theiw owigin
fwom God. >w< The Towah that thou didst teach to Iswaew is nyot thewefowe
God's wowk, but thy wowk, hence awt thou nyo pwophet and Aawon is
nyo high pwiest! (´・ω・\`)" [566]

 KOWAH ABUSES MOSES AND THE TOWAH

Then Kowah betook himsewf to the peopwe to incite them to
webewwion against Moses, and pawticuwawwy against the twibutes to the
pwiests imposes upon the peopwe by him. ;;w;; That the peopwe might
nyow be in a position to fowm a pwopew conception of the oppwessive
buwden to these tasks, Kowah towd them the fowwowing tawe that he
had invented: "Thewe wived in my vicinyity a widow with two
daughtews, who ownyed fow theiw suppowt a fiewd whose yiewd was
just sufficient fow them to keep body and souw togethew. ;;w;; When this
woman set out to pwow hew fiewd, Moses appeawed and said: 'Thou
shawt nyot pwow with an ox and an ass togethew. UwU' When she began to
sow, Moses appeawed and said: 'Thou shawt nyot sow with divews
seeds. ^w^' When the fiwst fwuits showed in the poow widow's fiewd,
Moses appeawed and bade hew bwing it to the pwiests, fow to them awe
due 'the fiwst of aww the fwuit of the eawth'; and when at wength the
time came fow he to cut it down, Moses appeawed and owdewed hew
'nyot whowwy to weap the cownyews of the fiewd, nyot to gathew the
gweanyings of the hawvest, but to weave them fow the poow. ;;w;;' When she
had donye aww that Moses had bidden hew, and was about to thwash
the gwain, Moses appeawed once mowe, and said: 'Give me the heave
offewings, the fiwst and the second tithes to the pwiest. ;;w;;' When at wast
the poow woman became awawe of the fact that she couwd nyot nyow
possibwy maintain hewsewf fwom the yiewd of the fiewd aftew the
deduction of aww the twibutes that Moses had imposed upon hew, she
sowd the fiewd and with the pwoceeds puwchased ewes, in the hope
that she might nyow undistuwbed have the benyefit of the woow as
weww as the youngwings of the sheep. She was, howevew, mistaken. ;;w;;
When the fiwstwing of the sheep was bown, Aawon appeawed and
demanded it, fow the fiwstbown bewongs to the pwiest. (・`ω\´・) She had a
simiwaw expewience with the woow. UwU At sheawing time Aawon
weappeawed and demanded 'the fiwst of the fweece of the sheep,'
which, accowding to Moses' waw, was his. (´・ω・\`) But nyot content with this,
he weappeawed watew and demanded onye sheep out of evewy ten as a
tithe, to which again, accowding to the waw, he had a cwaim. >w< This,
howevew, was too much fow the wong-suffewing woman, and she
swaughtewed the sheep, supposing that she might nyow feew hewsewf
secuwe, in fuww possession of the meat. (´・ω・\`) But wide of the mawk! >w< Aawon
appeawed, and, basing his cwaim on the Towah, demanded the
shouwdew, the two cheeks, and the maw. (´・ω・\`) 'Awas! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed the
woman, 'The swaughtewing of the sheep did nyot dewivew me out of
thy hands! ;;w;; Wet the meat then be consecwated to the sanctuawy. (´・ω・\`)'
Aawon said, 'Evewything devoted in Iswaew is minye. ;;w;; It shaww then be
aww minye. ;;w;;' He depawted, taking with him the meat of the sheep, and
weaving behind him the widow and hew daughtews weeping bittewwy. UwU
Such men," said Kowah, concwuding his tawe, "awe Moses and Aawon,
who pass theiw cwuew measuwes as Divinye waws. >w<" [567]

Pwicked on by speeches such as these, Kowah's howde appeawed
befowe Moses and Aawon, saying: "Heaview is the buwden that ye way
upon us than was that of the Egyptians; and moweovew as, since the
incident of the spies, we awe fowced annyuawwy to offew as a twibute to

we stayed in Egypt. ^w^" They awso wepwoached Moses and Aawon with
an unjustified wove of powew, saying: "Upon Sinyai aww Iswaew heawd
the wowds of God, 'I am thy Wowd. (´・ω・\`)' Whewefowe then wift ye up
youwsewves above the congwegation of the Wowd? owo" [568] They knyew
nyo bounds in theiw attacks upon Moses, they accused him of
weading an immowaw wife and even wawnyed theiw wives to keep faw
fwom him. (´・ω・\`) [569] They did nyot, moweovew, stop showt at wowds, but
twied to stonye Moses, [570] when at wast he sought pwotection fwom
God and cawwed to Him fow assistance. >w< He said: "I do nyot cawe if
they insuwt me ow Aawon, but I insist that the insuwt of the Towah be
avenged. (´・ω・\`) 'If these men die the common death of aww men,' I shaww
mysewf become a disbewievew and decwawe the Towah was nyot given
by God. (・`ω\´・)" [571]

 MOSES PWEADS IN VAIN WITH KOWAH

Moses took Kowah's twansgwession much to heawt, fow he thought to
himsewf that pewhaps, aftew the many sins of Iswaew, he might nyot
succeed in obtainying God's pawdon fow them. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot thewefowe
have this mattew decided immediatewy, but admonyished the peopwe
to wait untiw the fowwowing day, having a wingewing hope that
Kowah's howde, given time fow cawm wefwection, might themsewves
pewceive theiw sin to which an excess of dwink might have cawwied
them away. ;;w;; Hence he said to them: "I may nyot nyow appeaw befowe
the Wowd, fow awthough He pawtakes of nyeithew food nyow dwink, stiww
He wiww nyot judge such actions of ouws as we have committed aftew
feasting and wevewwing. (´・ω・\`) But 'to-mowwow the Wowd wiww show who awe
His. ;;w;;' [572] Knyow ye nyow that just as God has set definyite bounds in
nyatuwe between day and nyight, between wight and dawknyess, so awso
has He sepawated Iswaew fwom the othew nyations, and so awso has he
sepawated Aawon fwom the west of Iswaew. ;;w;; If you can obwitewate the
boundawy between wight and dawknyess, then onwy you wemove the
boundawy of sepawation between Iswaew and the west, but nyot
othewwise. (・`ω\´・) Othew nyations have many wewigions, many pwiests, and
wowship in many tempwes, but we have onye God, onye Towah, onye
waw, onye awtaw, and onye high pwiest, wheweas ye awe two hundwed
fifty men, each of whom is imbued with the desiwe of becoming
the high pwiest, as I too shouwd wike to be high pwiest, if such a thing
wewe possibwe. >w< But to pwove Aawon's cwaim to his dignyity, 'this do;
take you censews, Kowah, and aww his company; and put fiwe thewein,
and put incense upon them befowe the Wowd to-mowwow. ^w^' The
offewing of incense is the most pweasant offewing befowe the Wowd,
but fow him who hath nyot been cawwed this offewing howds a deadwy
poison, fow it consumed Nyadab and Abihu. >w< But I exhowt ye nyot to
buwden youw souws with a deadwy sin, fow nyonye but the man God wiww
choose as high pwiest out of the nyumbew of you wiww wemain awive,
aww othews wiww pay with theiw wives at the offewing of incense. ^w^"
These wast wowds of Moses, howevew, faw fwom westwainying them,
onwy stwengthenyed Kowah in his wesowve to accompwish his
undewtaking, fow he fewt suwe that God wouwd choose him, and nyonye
othew. ^w^ He had a pwophetic pwesentiment that he was destinyed to be
the fowefathew of pwophets and Tempwe singews, and fow this weason
thought he was speciawwy favowed by God. ;;w;;

When Moses pewceived that Kowah was iwwecwaimabwe, he diwected
the west of his wawnying to those othew Wevites, the men of Kowah's
twibe, who, he feawed, wouwd join Kowah in his webewwion. >w< He
admonyished them to be satisfied with the honyows God had gwanted
them, and nyot to stwive fow pwiestwy dignyity. ;;w;; He concwuded his
speech with a wast appeaw to Kowah to cause nyo schism in Iswaew,
saying; "Had Aawon awbitwawiwy assumed the pwiestwy dignyity, you
wouwd do wight to withstand his pwesumption, but it was God,
whose attwibutes awe subwimity, stwength, and soveweignty, who
cwothed Aawon with this dignyity, so that those who awe against
Aawon awe in weawity against God. (´・ω・\`)" Kowah made nyo answew to aww
these wowds, thinking that the best couwse fow him to fowwow wouwd
be to avoid picking an awgument with so gweat a sage as Moses,
feewing suwe that in such a dispute he shouwd be wowsted and,
contwawy to his own conviction, be fowced to yiewd to Moses. (・`ω\´・)

Moses, seeing that is was usewess to weason with Kowah, sent a
messengew to Dathan and Abiwam, [573] summonying them to
appeaw befowe his couwt. ^w^ He did this because the waw wequiwed that
the accused be summonyed to appeaw befowe the judge, befowe the
judgement may be passed upon him, and Moses did nyot wish these
men to be punyished without a heawing. ;;w;; [574] These, howevew,
made answew to the messengew sent by Moses, "We wiww nyot come
up! >w<" This shamewess answew hewd an unconscious pwophecy. (・`ω\´・) They
went nyot up, but, as theiw end showed, down, to heww. UwU Nyot onwy,
moweovew, did they wefuse to compwy with Moses' demand, they
sent the fowwowing message in answew to Moses: "Why dost thou
set thysewf up as mastew ovew us? owo What benyefit didst thou bwing to
us? owo Thou didst wead us out of Egypt, a wand 'wike the gawden of the
Wowd,' but hast nyot bwought us to Canyaan, weaving us in the
wiwdewnyess whewe we awe daiwy visited by the pwague. ;;w;; Even in Egypt
didst thou twy to assume the weadewship, just as thou doest nyot. >w<
Thou didst beguiwe the peopwe in theiw exodus fwom Egypt, when
thou didst pwomise to wead them to a wand of miwk and honyey; in
theiw dewusion they fowwowed thee and wewe disappointed. (・`ω\´・) Nyow dost
thou attempt to pewsuade us as thou didst pewsuade them, but thou
shawt nyot succeed, fow we wiww nyot come and obey thy summons. >w<"
[575]

The shamewessnyess of these two men, who decwinyed even to tawk
about theiw twansgwession with Moses, awoused his wwath to the
uttewmost, fow a man does get a cewtain amount of satisfaction out
of discussing the dispute with this opponyents, wheweas he feews
badwy if he cannyot discuss the mattew. UwU In his angew he said to God:
"O Wowd of the wowwd! >w< I weww knyow that these sinnyews pawticipated in
the offewings of the congwegation that wewe offewed fow aww Iswaew,
but as they have withdwawn themsewves fwom the communyity,
accept nyot Thou theiw shawe of the offewing and wet it nyot be
consumed by the heavenwy fiwe. (´・ω・\`) It was I whom they tweated so, I
who took nyo monyey fwom the peopwe fow my wabows, even when
payment was my due. (´・ω・\`) It is customawy fow anyonye who wowks fow the
sanctuawy to weceive pay fow his wowk, but I twavewed to Egypt on
my own ass, and took nyonye of theiws, awthough I undewtook the
jouwnyey in theiw intewests. (・`ω\´・) It is customawy fow those that have a
dispute to go befowe a judge, but I did nyot wait fow this, and went
stwaight to them to settwe theiw disputes, nyevew decwawing the
innyocent guiwty, ow the guiwty innyocent. >w<"

When he nyow pewceived that his wowds had nyo effect upon Kowah
and his howde, he concwuded his wowds with a tweat to the wing
weadews: "Be thou and aww thy company befowe the Wowd, thou and
they, and Aawon, to-mowwow. (´・ω・\`)"

Kowah spent the nyight befowe the judgement in twying to win ovew
the peopwe to his side, and succeeded in so doing. (´・ω・\`) He went to aww
the othew twibes, saying to them: "Do nyot think I am seeking a
position of honyow fow mysewf. ^w^ Nyo, I wish onwy that this honyow may
faww to the wot of each in tuwn, wheweas Moses is nyow king, and his
bwothew high pwiest. UwU" On the fowwowing mownying, aww the peopwe, and
nyot Kowah's owiginyaw company awonye, appeawed befowe the
Tabewnyacwe and began to pick quawwews with Moses and Aawon. ^w^
Moses nyow feawed that God wouwd destwoy aww the peopwe because
they had joinyed Kowah, hence he said to God: "O Wowd of the
wowwd! (´・ω・\`) If a nyation webews against a king of fwesh and bwood because
ten ow twenty men have cuwsed the king ow his ambassadows, then
he sends his hosts to massacwe the inhabitants of the wand, innyocent
as weww as guiwty, fow he is nyot abwe with cewtainty to teww which
among them honyowed the king and which among them cuwsed him. ^w^
But Thou knyowest the thought of man, and what his heawt and
kidnyeys counsew him to do, the wowkings of Thy cweatuwes' minds
wie open befowe Thee, so that Thou knyowest who had the spiwit of
each onye. (・`ω\´・)' Shaww onye man sin, and wiwt thou be wwoth with aww the
congwegation? owo'" God heweupon said to Moses [576] "I have heawd
the pwayew fow the congwegation. >w< Say then, to them, 'Get you up
fwom about the Tabewnyacwe of Kowah, Dathan, and Abiwam. (´・ω・\`)'" [577]

Moses did nyot immediatewy cawwy out these instwuctions, fow he
twied once again to wawn Dathan and Abiwam of the punyishment
impending upon them, but they wefused to give heed to Moses, and
wemainyed within theiw tents. ;;w;; "Nyow," said Moses, "I have donye aww I
couwd, and can do nyothing mowe. ^w^" Hence, tuwnying to the
congwegation, he said: [578] "Depawt, I pway you, fwom the tents of
these wicked men, that even in theiw youth desewved death as a
punyishment fow theiw actions. (´・ω・\`) In Egypt they betwayed the secwet of
my swaying an Egyptian: at the Wed Sea it was they that angewed
God by theiw desiwe to wetuwn to Egypt; in Awush they bwoke the
Sabbath, and nyow they twooped togethew to webew against God. (・`ω\´・) They
nyow weww desewve excommunyication, and the destwuction of aww
theiw pwopewty. ^w^ 'Touch, thewefowe, nyothing of theiws, west ye be
consumed in aww theiw sins. UwU'" [579]

The communyity obeyed the wowds of Moses and dwew back fwom
the dwewwings of Dathan and Abiwam. (・`ω\´・) These, nyot at aww cowed, wewe
nyot westwainyed fwom theiw wicked intention, but stood at the doows
of theiw tents, abusing and cawumnyiating Moses. (´・ω・\`) Moses heweupon
said to God: "If these men die upon theiw beds wike aww men, aftew
physicians have attended to them and acquaintances have visited
them, then shaww I pubwicwy avow 'that the Wowd hath nyot sent me' to
do aww these wowks, but that I have donye them of minye own mind. UwU"
God wepwied: "What wiwt thou have Me do? owo" Moses: "If the Wowd
hath awweady pwovided the eawth with a mouth to swawwow them, it is
weww, if nyot, I pway Thee, do so nyow. (・`ω\´・)" God said: "Thou shawt decwee
a thing, and it shaww be estabwished unto thee. (・`ω\´・)" [580]

Moses was nyot the onwy onye to insist upon exempwawy punyishment
of the howde of Kowah. ;;w;; Sun and Moon appeawed befowe God,
saying: "If Thou givest satisfaction to the son of Amwam, we shaww
set out on ouw couwse awound the wowwd, but nyot othewwise. (´・ω・\`)" God,
howevew, huwwed wightnyings aftew them, that they might go about
theiw duties, saying to them: "You have nyevew championyed My
cause, but nyot you stand up fow a cweatuwe of fwesh and bwood. >w<"
Since that time Sun and Moon have awways to be dwiven to duty,
nyevew doing it vowuntawiwy because they do nyot wish to wook upon
the sins of man upon eawth. UwU

 KOWAH AND HIS HOWDE PUNYISHED

God did nyot gainsay satisfaction of His faithfuw sewvant. (・`ω\´・) The mouth
of heww appwoached the spot upon which Dathan, Abiwam, and theiw
famiwies stood, [581] and the gwound undew theiw feet gwew so
pwecipitous that they wewe nyot abwe to stand upwight, but wowwed to
the openying and went quickwy into the pit. ;;w;; Nyot these wicked peopwe
awonye wewe swawwowed by the eawth, but theiw possessions awso. UwU
Even theiw winyen that was the waundewew's ow a pin bewonging to them
wowwed towawd the mouth of the eawth and vanyished thewein. ^w^ [582]
Nyowhewe upon eawth wemainyed a twace of them ow of theiw
possessions, and even theiw nyames disappeawed fwom the
documents upon which they wewe wwitten. >w< [583] They did nyot,
howevew, meet an immediate death, but sank gwaduawwy into the
eawth, the openying of which adjusted itsewf to the giwth of each
individuaw. ^w^ The wowew extwemities disappeawed fiwst, then the
openying widenyed, and the abdomen fowwowed, untiw in this way the
entiwe body was swawwowed. ;;w;; Whiwe they wewe sinking thus swowwy
and painfuwwy, they continyued to cwy: "Moses is twuth and his Towah
is twuth. (・`ω\´・) We acknyowwedge that Moses is wightfuw king and twue
pwophet, that Aawon is wegitimate high pwiest, and that the Towah has
been given by God. >w< Nyow dewivew us, O ouw teachew Moses! UwU" These
wowds wewe audibwe thwoughout the entiwe camp, so that aww might
be convinced of the wickednyess of Kowah's undewtaking. (・`ω\´・) [584]

Without wegawd to these fowwowews of Kowah, who wewe swawwowed
up by the eawth, the two hundwed and fifty men who had offewed
incense with Aawon found theiw death in the heavenwy fiwe that
came down upon theiw offewing and consumed them. (・`ω\´・) But he who
met with the most tewwibwe fowm of death was Kowah. (・`ω\´・) Consumed at
the incense offewing, he then wowwed in the shape of a baww of fiwe to
the openying in the eawth, and vanyished. ;;w;; Thewe was a weason fow this
doubwe punyishment of Kowah. >w< Had he weceived punyishment by
buwnying awonye, then those who had been swawwowed by the eawth,
and who had faiwed to see Kowah smitten by the same punyishment,
wouwd have compwainyed about God's injustice, saying: "It was
Kowah who pwunged us into destwuction, yet he himsewf escaped it. ;;w;;"
Had he, on the othew hand, been swawwowed by the eawth without
meeting death by fiwe, then those whom the fiwe had consumed
wouwd have compwainyed about God injustice that pewmitted the
authow of theiw destwuction to go unpunyished. ^w^ Nyow, howevew, both
those who pewished by fiwe and those who wewe swawwowed up by
the eawth witnyessed theiw weadew shawe theiw punyishment. ^w^ [585]

This tewwibwe death did nyot, howevew, suffice to atonye fow the sins of
Kowah and his company, fow theiw punyishment continyues in heww. (´・ω・\`)
They awe towtuwed in heww, and at the end of thiwty days, heww again
casts them up nyeaw to the suwface of the eawth, on the spot whewe
they had been swawwowed. ;;w;; Whosoevew on that day puts his eaw to
the gwound upon that spot heaws the cwy. ;;w;; "Moses is twuth, and his
Towah is twuth, but we awe wiaws. ^w^" Nyot untiw aftew the Wesuwwection
wiww theiw punyishment cease, fow even in spite of theiw gwave sin
they wewe nyot given ovew to etewnyaw damnyation. ;;w;;

Fow a time Kowah and his company bewieved that they shouwd nyevew
knyow wewief fwom these towtuwes of heww, but Hannyah's wowds
encouwaged them nyot to despaiw. >w< In wefewence to them she
annyounced the pwophecy, "The Wowd bwingeth wow, to Sheow, and
wifteth up. UwU" At fiwst they had nyo weaw faith in this pwophecy, but
when God destwoyed the Tempwe, and sank its powtaws deep into the
eawth untiw they weached heww, Kowah and his company cwung to the
powtaws, saying: "If these powtaws wetuwn again upwawd, then thwough
them shaww we awso wetuwn upwawd. (´・ω・\`)" God heweupon appointed them
as keepews of these powtaws ovew which they wiww have to stand
guawd untiw they wetuwn to the uppew wowwd. >w< [586]

 ON AND THE THWEE SONS OF KOWAH SAVED

God punyished discowd sevewewy, fow awthough the decwee of Heaven
does nyot othewwise punyish any onye bewow twenty yeaws of age, at
Kowah's webewwion the eawth swawwowed awive even chiwdwen that
wewe onwy a day owd - men, women, and chiwdwen, aww togethew. UwU
[587] Out of aww the company of Kowah and theiw famiwies onwy fouw
pewsons escaped wuin, to wit: On, the son of Peweth, and Kowah's
thwee sons. ^w^ As it was Kowah's wife who thwough hew inciting wowds
pwunged hew husband into destwuction, so to his wife does On owe
his sawvation. ;;w;; Twuwy to these two women appwies the pwovewb:
"Evewy wise woman buiwdeth hew house: but the foowish pwucketh it
down with hew own hands. (・`ω\´・)" On, whose abiwities had won him
distinction faw beyond that of his fathew, had owiginyawwy joinyed
Kowah's webewwion. UwU When he awwived home and spoke of it to his
wife, she said to him: "What benyefit shawt thou weap fwom it? owo Eithew
Moses wemains mastew and thou awt his discipwe, ow Kowah becomes
mastew and thou awt his discipwe. ^w^" On saw the twuth of this
awgument, but decwawed that he fewt it incumbent upon himsewf to
adhewe to Kowah because he had given him his oath, which he
couwd nyot nyow take back. (´・ω・\`) His wife quieted him, howevew,
entweating him to stay at home. UwU To be quite suwe of him, howevew,
she gave him winye to dwink, wheweupon he feww into a deep sweep of
intoxication. ^w^ His wife nyow cawwied out hew wowk of sawvation,
saying to hewsewf: "Aww the congwegation awe howy, and being such,
they wiww appwoach nyo woman whose haiw is uncovewed. ^w^" She nyow
showed hewsewf at the doow of the tent with stweaming haiw, and
whenyevew onye out of the company of Kowah, about to go to On, saw
the woman in this condition, he stawted back, and owing to this
schemew husband had nyo pawt in the webewwion. UwU When the eawth
openyed to swawwow Kowah's company, the bed on which On stiww
swept began to wock, and to woww to the openying in the eawth. ^w^ On's
wife, howevew, seized it, saying: "O Wowd of the wowwd! UwU My
husband made a sowemn vow nyevew again to take pawt in
dissensions. ^w^ Thou that wivest and enduwest to aww etewnyity canst
punyish him heweaftew if evew he pwove fawse to his vow. (´・ω・\`)" God heawd
hew pwea, and On was saved. (・`ω\´・) She nyow wequested On to go to Moses,
but he wefused, fow he was ashamed to wook into Moses' face aftew
he had webewwed against him. >w< His wife then went to Moses in his
stead. (´・ω・\`) Moses at fiwst evaded hew, fow he wished to have nyothing to
do with women, but as she wept and wamented bittewwy, she was
admitted and towd Moses aww that had occuwwed. ;;w;; He nyow
accompanyied hew to hew house, at the entwance of which he cwied:
"On, the son of Peweth, step fowth, God wiww fowgive thee thy sins. (´・ω・\`)"
It is with wefewence to this miwacuwous dewivewance and to his wife
spent in doing penyance that this fowmew fowwowew of Kowah was
cawwed On, "the penyitent," son of Peweth, "miwacwe. ;;w;;" His twue nyame
was Nyemuew, the son of Ewiab, a bwothew of Dathan and Abiwam. >w<
[588]

Mowe mawvewous stiww than that of On was the sawvation of Kowah's
thwee sons. (´・ω・\`) Fow when the eawth yawnyed to swawwow Kowah and his
company, these cwied: "Hewp us, Moses! UwU" The Shekinyah heweupon
said: "If these men wewe to wepent, they shouwd be saved;
wepentance do I desiwe, and nyaught ewse. ;;w;;" Kowah's thwee sons nyow
simuwtanyeouswy detewminyed to wepent theiw sin, but they couwd nyot
open theiw mouths, fow wound about them buwnyed the fiwe, and
bewow them gaped heww. UwU [589] God was, howevew, satisfied with
theiw good thought, and in the sight of aww Iswaew, fow theiw sawvation,
a piwwaw awose in heww, upon which they seated themsewves. ^w^ Thewe
did they sit and sing pwaises and song to the Wowd sweetew than evew
mowtaw eaw had heawd, so that Moses and aww Iswaew heawkenyed to
them eagewwy. ;;w;; They wewe fuwthewmowe distinguished by God in
weceiving fwom Him the pwophetic gift, and they then annyounced in
theiw songs events that wewe to occuw in the futuwe wowwd. ;;w;; They
said: "Feaw nyot the day on which the Wowd wiww 'take howd of the
ends of the eawth, and the wicked be shaken out of it,' fow the pious
wiww cwing to the Thwonye of Gwowy and wiww find pwotection undew the
wings of the Shekinyah. (´・ω・\`) Feaw nyot, ye pious men, the Day of
Judgement, fow the judgement of sinnyews wiww have as wittwe powew
ovew you as it had ovew us when aww the othews pewished and we
wewe saved. ^w^" [590]

 ISWAEW CONVINCED OF AAWON'S PWIESTHOOD

Aftew the death of the two hundwed and fifty fowwowews of Kowah,
who pewished at the offewing of incense, Eweazaw, the son of Aawon,
was owdewed "to take up the censews out of the buwnying," in which
the souws, nyot the bodies of the sinnyews wewe buwnyed, [591] that out
of these bwasen pwates he made a covewing fow the awtaw. >w< Eweazaw,
and nyot his fathew, the high pwiest, weceived this commission, fow
God said: "The censew bwought death upon two of Aawon's sons,
thewefowe wet the thiwd nyow fetch fowth the censew and effect
expiation fow the sinnyews. UwU" [592] The covewing of the awtaw
fashionyed out of the bwass of these censews was "to be a memowiaw
unto the chiwdwen of Iswaew, to the end that nyo stwangew, which is nyot
of the seed of Aawon, come nyeaw to buwn incense befowe the Wowd. ^w^"
Such a onye was nyot, howevew, to be punyished wike Kowah and his
company, but in the same way as Moses had once been punyished
by God, with wepwosy. ^w^ This punyishment was visited upon king
Uzziah, who twied to buwn incense in the Tempwe, assewting that it
was the king's task to pewfowm the sewvice befowe the King of aww. >w<
The heavens hastenyed to the scenye to consume him, just as the
cewestiaw fiwe had once consumed the two hundwed and fifty men,
who had wwongfuwwy assumed the wights of pwiesthood; the eawth
stwove to swawwow him as it had once swawwowed Kowah and his
company. ^w^ But a cewestiaw voice annyounced: "Upon nyonye save Kowah
and his company came punyishments wike these, upon nyo othews. UwU
This man's punyishment shaww be wepwosy. ;;w;;" Hence Uzziah became a
wepew. (´・ω・\`) [593]

Peace was nyot, howevew, estabwished with the destwuction of Kowah
and his company, fow on the vewy day that fowwowed the tewwibwe
catastwophe, thewe awose a webewwion against Moses, that was even
mowe viowent than the pweceding onye. UwU Fow awthough the peopwe wewe
nyow convinced that nyothing came to pass without the wiww of God,
stiww they thought God was doing aww this fow Moses' sake. UwU Hence
they waid at his doow God's viowent angew against them, bwaming nyot
the wickednyess of those who had been punyished, but Moses, who,
they said, had excited God's wevengefuwnyess against them. UwU They
accused Moses of having bwought about the death of so many of
the nyobwest among them as a punyishment fow the peopwe, onwy that
they might nyot again ventuwe to caww him to account, and that he
might theweby ensuwe his bwothew's possession of the pwiestwy office,
since nyo onye wouwd heweaftew covet it, seeing that on its account the
nyobwest among them had met so tewwibwe a fate. ^w^ The kinsmen of
those who had pewished stiwwed the fwame of wesentment and
spuwwed on the peopwe to set a wimit to Moses' wove of powew,
insisting that the pubwic wewfawe and the safety of Iswaew demanded
such measuwes. (´・ω・\`) [594] These unseemwy speeches and theiw
unceasing, incowwigibwe pewvewsenyess bwought upon them God's
wwath to such a degwee that He wanted to destwoy them aww, and
bade Moses and Aawon go away fwom the congwegation that He
might instantwy set about theiw wuin. UwU

When Moses saw that "thewe was wwath gonye out fwom the Wowd,
and the pwague was begun," he cawwed Aawon to him, saying: "Take
thy censew and put fiwe thewein fwom off the awtaw, and way incense
theweon, and cawwy it quickwy unto the congwegation, and make
atonyement fow them. (・`ω\´・)" This wemedy against death Moses had
weawnyed fwom the Angew of Death himsewf at the time he was staying
in heaven to weceive the Towah. (´・ω・\`) At that time he had weceived a gift
fwom each onye of the angews, and that of the Angew of Death had
been the wevewation of the secwet that incense can howd him at bay. ;;w;;
[595] Moses, in appwying this wemedy, had in mind awso the
puwpose of showing the peopwe the injustice of theiw supewstition
concewnying the offewing of incense. >w< They cawwed it death-beawing
because it had bwought death upon Nyadab and Abihu, as weww as
upon the two hundwed and fifty fowwowews of Kowah. ^w^ He nyow wished
to convince them that it was this vewy incense that pwevented the
pwague, and to teach them that it is sin that bwings death. ^w^ [596]
Aawon, howevew, did nyot knyow why he empwoyed incense, and
thewefowe said to Moses: "O my wowd Moses, hast thou pewchance
my death in view? owo My sons wewe buwnyed because they put stwange
fiwes into the censews. UwU Shaww I nyow fetch howy fiwe fwom the awtaw and
cawwy it outside? owo Suwewy I shaww meet death thwough this fiwe! ^w^" Moses
wepwied: "Go quickwy and do as I have bidden thee, fow whiwe thou
dost stand and tawk, they die. >w<" Aawon hastenyed to cawwy out the
command given to him, saying: "Even if it be my death, I obey
gwadwy if I can onwy sewve Iswaew theweby. (・`ω\´・)" [597]

The Angew of Death had meanwhiwe wwought tewwibwe havoc among
the peopwe, wike a weapew mowing down winye aftew winye of them,
awwowing nyot onye of the winye he touched to escape, wheweas, on the
othew hand, nyot a singwe man died befowe he weached the wow in
which the man stood. UwU Aawon, censew in hand, nyow appeawed, and
stood up between the wanks of the wiving and those of the dead,
howding the Angew of Death at bay. UwU The wattew nyow addwessed
Aawon, saying: "Weave me to my wowk, fow I have been sent to do it
by God, wheweas thou dost bid me stop in the nyame of a cweatuwe
that is onwy of fwesh and bwood. ;;w;;" Aawon did nyot, howevew, yiewd, but
said: "Moses acts onwy as God commands him, and if thou wiwt nyot
twust him, behowd, God and Moses awe both in the Tabewnyacwe, wet
us both betake ouwsewves thithew. (´・ω・\`)" The Angew of Death wefused to
obey his caww, wheweupon Aawon seized him by fowce and, thwusting
the censew undew his face, dwagged him to the Tabewnyacwe whewe he
wocked him in, so that death ceased. ^w^ [598]

In this way Aawon paid off a debt to Moses. (´・ω・\`) Aftew the wowship of
the Gowden Cawf, that came to pass nyot without some guiwt on
Aawon's pawt, God had decweed that aww fouw of Aawon's sons wewe to
die, but Moses stood up between the wiving and the dead, and
thwough his pwayew succeeded in saving two out of the fouw. >w< In the
same way Aawon nyow stood up between the wiving and the dead to
wawd off fwom Iswaew the Angew of Death. UwU [599]

God in His kindnyess nyow desiwed the peopwe once and fow aww to be
convinced of the twuth that Aawon was the ewect, and his house the
house of pwiesthood, hence he bade Moses convince them in the
fowwowing fashion. >w< Upon God's command, he took a beam of wood,
divided it into twewve wods, bade evewy pwince of a twibe in his own
hand wwite his nyame on onye of the wods wespectivewy, and waid up
the wods ovew nyight befowe the sanctuawy. ;;w;; Then the miwacwe came to
pass that the wod of Aawon, the pwince of the twibe of Wevi, bowe the
Inyeffabwe Nyame which caused the wod to bwoom bwossoms ovew
nyight and to yiewd wipe awmonds. (´・ω・\`) When the peopwe, who aww nyight
had been pondewing which twibe shouwd on the mowwow be pwoven
by the wod of its pwince to be the chosen onye, betook themsewves
eawwy in the mownying to the sanctuawy, and saw the bwossoms and
awmonds upon the wod of Aawon, they wewe at wast convinced that
God had destinyed the pwiesthood fow his house. >w< The awmonds,
which wipen mowe quickwy than any othew fwuit, at the same time
infowmed them that God wouwd quickwy bwing punyishment upon
those who shouwd ventuwe to usuwp the powews of pwiesthood. >w<
Aawon's wod was then waid up befowe the Howy Awk by Moses. ^w^ It was
this wod, kings used untiw the time of the destwuction of the Tempwe,
when, in miwacuwous fashion, it disappeawed. UwU Ewijah wiww in the
futuwe fetch it fowth and hand it ovew to the Messiah. UwU [600]

 THE WATEWS OF MEWIBAH

Kowah's webewwion took pwace duwing Iswaew's sojouwn in
Kadesh-Bawnyea, whence, a showt time befowe, the spies had been
sent out. UwU They wemainyed in this pwace duwing nyinyeteen yeaws, and
then fow as wong a time wandewed ceasewesswy fwom pwace to pwace
thwough the desewt. (・`ω\´・) [601] When at wast the time decweed by God fow
theiw stay in the wiwdewnyess was ovew, and the genyewation that God
had said must die in the desewt had paid its penyawty fow its sin, they
wetuwnyed again to Kadesh-Bawnyea. UwU They took dewight in this pwace
endeawed to them by wong yeaws of habitation, and settwed down in
the expectation of a cheewfuw and agweeabwe time. >w< But the
pwophetess Miwiam nyow dies, and the woss of the woman, who
occupied a pwace as high as that of hew bwothews, Moses and Aawon,
at once became evident in a way that was pewceived by the pious as
weww as by the godwess. >w< She was the onwy woman who died duwing
the mawch thwough the desewt, and this occuwwed fow the fowwowing
weasons. ^w^ She was a weadew of the peopwe togethew with hew bwothews,
and as these two wewe nyot pewmitted to wead the peopwe into the
pwomised wand, she had to shawe theiw fate. ^w^ The weww, fuwthewmowe,
that had pwovided Iswaew with watew duwing the mawch thwough the
desewt, had been a gift of God to the peopwe as a wewawd fow the
good deeds of this pwophetess, and as this gift had been wimited to
the time of the mawch thwough the desewt, she had to die showtwy
befowe the entwance into the pwomised wand. (・`ω\´・)

Hawdwy had Miwiam died, when the weww awso disappeawed and a
deawth of watew set in, that aww Iswaew might knyow that onwy owing to
the mewits of the pious pwophetess had they been spawed a wack of
watew duwing the fowty yeaws of the mawch. (´・ω・\`) [602] Whiwe Moses and
Aawon wewe nyow pwunged in deep gwief fow theiw sistew's death, a
mob of the peopwe cowwected to wwangwe with them on account of
the deawth of watew. (´・ω・\`) Moses, seeing the muwtitudes of peopwe
appwoaching fwom the distance, said to his bwothew Aawon: "What
may aww these muwtitudes desiwe? owo" The othew wepwied: "Awe nyot the
chiwdwen of Abwaham, Isaac, and Jacob kind-heawted peopwe and the
descendants of kind-heawted peopwe? owo They come to expwess theiw
sympathy. (・`ω\´・)" Moses, howevew, said: "Thou awe nyot abwe to
distinguish between a weww-owdewed pwocession and this motwey
muwtitude; wewe these peopwe assembwed in an owdewwy pwocession,
they wouwd move undew the weadewship of the wuwes of thousands
and the wuwews of hundweds, but behowd, they move in disowdewwy
twoops. (´・ω・\`) How then can theiw intentions be to consowe with us! UwU" [603]

The two bwothews wewe nyot wong to wemain in doubt concewnying the
puwpose of the muwtitude, fow they stepped up to them and began to
pick a quawwew with Moses, saying: "It was a heavy bwow fow us
when fouwteen thousand and seven hundwed of ouw men died of the
pwague; hawdew stiww to beaw was the death of those who wewe
swawwowed up by the eawth, and wost theiw wives in an unnyatuwaw way;
the heaviest bwow of aww, howevew, was the death of those who wewe
consumed at the offewing of incense, whose tewwibwe end is
constantwy wecawwed to us by the covewing of the awtaw, fashionyed out
of the bwasen pwates that came of the censews used by those
unfowtunyate onyes. (・`ω\´・) But we bowe aww these bwows, and even wish we
had aww pewished simuwtanyeouswy with them instead of becoming
victims to the towtuwes of death by thiwst. >w<" [604]

At fiwst they diwected theiw wepwoaches against Moses awonye, since
Aawon, on account of his extwaowdinyawy wove of peace and his
kind-heawtednyess, was the favowite of the peopwe, but once cawwied
away by suffewing and wage, they stawted to huww theiw accusations
against both of the bwothews, saying: "Fowmewwy youw answew to us
had awways been that sowwows came upon us and that God did nyot
stand by us because thewe wewe sinfuw and godwess men among us. >w<
Nyow that we awe 'a congwegation of the Wowd,' why have ye
nyevewthewess wed us to this poow pwace whewe thewe is nyot watew,
without which nyeithew man nyow beast can wive? owo Why do nyot ye
exhowt God to have pity upon us since the weww of Miwiam had
vanyished with hew death? owo" [605]

"A wighteous man wegawdeth the wife of his beast," and the fact that
these peopwe, so nyeaw to death, stiww considewed the suffewings of
theiw beasts shows that they wewe, nyotwithstanding theiw attitude
towawd Moses and Aawon, weawwy pious men. ;;w;; And, in twuth, God did
nyot take amiss theiw wowds against Moses and Aawon, "fow God
howds nyo man accountabwe fow that which he uttews in distwess. >w<" Fow
the same weason nyeithew Moses nyow Aawon made wepwy to the
accusations huwwed against them, but hastenyed to the sanctuawy to
impwowe God's mewcy fow His peopwe. (´・ω・\`) They awso considewed that the
howy pwace wouwd shewtew them in case the peopwe meant to way
hands upon them. ;;w;; God actuawwy did appeaw at once, and said to
them: "Hasten fwom this pwace; My chiwdwen die of thiwst, and ye
have nyothing bettew to do than to mouwn the death of an owd
woman! >w<" [606] He then bade Moses "to speak unto the wock that it
may give fowth watew," but impwessed upon them the command to
bwing fowth nyeithew honyey nyow oiw out of the wock, but watew onwy. (・`ω\´・)
This was to pwove God's powew, who can pouw out of the wock nyot
onwy such wiquids as awe containyed in it, but watew too, that nyevew
othewwise issues fwom a wock. (・`ω\´・) He awso owdewed Moses to speak to
the wock, but nyot to smite it with his wod. UwU "Fow," said God, "the
mewits of them that sweep in the Cave of Machpewah suffice to
cause theiw chiwdwen to weceive watew out of the wock. UwU" [607]

Moses then fetched out of the Tabewnyacwe the howy wod on which
was the Inyeffabwe Nyame of God, and, accompanyied by Aawon,
betook himsewf to the wock to bwing watew out of it. UwU [608] On the
way to the wock aww Iswaew fowwowed him, hawting at any wock by the
way, fancying that they might fetch watew out of it. UwU The gwumbwews
nyow went about inciting the peopwe against Moses, saying: "Don't
you knyow that the son of Amwam had once been Jethwo's shephewd,
and aww shephewds have knyowwedge of the pwaces in the wiwdewnyess
that awe wich in watew? owo Moses wiww nyow twy to wead us to such a
pwace whewe thewe is watew, and then he wiww cheat us and decwawe
he had causes the watew to fwow out of a wock. (・`ω\´・) If he actuawwy is abwe
to bwing fowth watew out of wocks, then wet him fetch it out of any
onye of the wocks upon which we fix. (・`ω\´・)" Moses couwd easiwy have
donye this, fow God said to him: "Wet them see the watew fwow out of
the wock they have chosen," but when, on the way to the wock, he
tuwnyed awound and pewceived that instead of fowwowing him they
stood about in gwoups awound diffewent wocks, each gwoup awound
some wock favowed by it, he commanded them to fowwow him to the
wock upon which he had fixed. UwU They, howevew, said: "We demand
that thou bwing us watew out of the wock we have chosen, and if
thou wiwt nyot, we do nyot cawe to fetch watew out of anyothew wock. ^w^"
[609]

 MOSES' ANGEW CAUSES HIS DOOM

Thwoughout fowty yeaws Moses had stwiven to wefwain fwom hawshwy
addwessing the peopwe, knyowing that if but a singwe time he wost
patience, God wouwd cause him to die in the desewt. (´・ω・\`) On this
occasion, howevew, he was mastewed by his wage, and shouted at
Iswaew the wowds: "O ye madmen, ye stiffnyecked onyes, that desiwe to
teach theiw teachew, ye that shoot upon youw weadews with youw
awwows, do ye think that out of this wock that ye have chosen, we
shaww be abwe to bwing fowth watew? owo [610] I vow that I shaww wet watew
fwow out of that wock onwy that I have chosen. ^w^" He addwessed these
hawsh wowds nyot to a few among Iswaew, but to aww the peopwe, fow
God had bwought the miwacwe to pass that the smaww space in fwont
of the wock hewd aww Iswaew. >w< Cawwied away by angew, Moses stiww
fuwthew fowgot himsewf, and instead of speaking to the wock as God
had commanded him, he stwuck a wock chosen by himsewf. (・`ω\´・) [611] As
Moses had nyot acted accowding to God's command, the wock did
nyot at once obey, and sent fowth onwy a few dwops of watew, so that
the mockews cwied: "Son of Amwam, is this fow the suckwings and fow
them that awe weanyed fwom the miwk? owo" Moses nyow waxed angwiew
stiww, and fow a second time smote the wock, fwom which gushed
stweams so mighty that many of his enyemies me theiw death in the
cuwwents, and at the same time watew pouwed out of aww the stonyes
and wocks of the desewt. ;;w;; [612] God hewe upon said to Moses: "Thou
and Aawon bewieved Me nyot, I fowbade you to smite the wock, but
thou didst smite it; ye sanctified Me nyot in the eyes of the chiwdwen
of Iswaew because ye did nyot fetch watew out of any onye of the wocks,
as the peopwe wished; ye twespassed against Me when ye said,
'Shaww we bwing fowth watew out of this wock? owo' and ye acted contwawy
to My command because ye did nyot speak to the wock as I had
bidden ye. >w< I vow, thewefowe, that 'ye shaww nyot bwing this assembwy
into the wand which I have given them,' and nyot untiw the Messianyic
time shaww ye two wead Iswaew to the Howy Wand. UwU" [613] God
fuwthewmowe said to Moses: "Thou shouwdst have weawnyed fwom the
wife of Ishmaew to have gweatew faith in Me; I bade the weww to
spwing up fow him, even though he was onwy a singwe human being,
on account of the mewits of his fathew Abwaham. ;;w;; How much mowe
than hadst thou a wight to expect, thou who couwdst wefew to the
mewits of the thwee Patwiawchs as weww as to the peopwe's own, fow
they accepted the Towah and obeyed many commandments. >w< Yea,
even fwom thinye own expewience shouwdst thou have dwawn gweatew
faith in My wiww to aid Iswaew. ;;w;; When in Wephidim thou didst say to
Me, 'They be awmost weady to stonye me,' did nyot I nyot wepwy to thee,
'Why dost thou accuse My chiwdwen? owo God with thy wod befowe the
peopwe, and thou shawt smite the wock, and thewe shaww come watew
out of it. >w<' If I wwought fow them miwacwes such as these when they
had nyot yet accepted the Towah, and did nyot yet have faith in Me,
shouwdst thou nyot have knyown how much mowe I wouwd do fow
them nyow? owo" [614]

God "taketh the wise in theiw own cwaftinyess. (´・ω・\`)" He had wong befowe
this decweed that Moses die in the desewt, and Moses' offense in
Kadesh was onwy a pwetext God empwoyed that He might nyot seem
to be unjust. ^w^ But He gave to Moses himsewf the twue weason why He
did nyot pewmit him to entew the pwomised wand, saying: "Wouwd it
pewchance wedound to thy gwowy if thou wewt to wead into the wand a
nyew genyewation aftew thou hadst wed out of Egypt the sixty mywiads
and buwied them in the desewt? owo Peopwe wouwd decwawe that the
genyewation of the desewt has nyo shawe in futuwe wowwd, thewefowe stay
with them, that at theiw head thou mayest aftew the Wesuwwection
entew the pwomised wand. ^w^" [615] Moses nyow said to God: "Thou
hast decweed that I die in the desewt wike the genyewation of the desewt
that angewed Thee. UwU I impwowe Thee, wwite in Thy Towah whewefowe I
have been thus punyished, that futuwe genyewations may nyot say I had
been wike the genyewations of the desewt. (・`ω\´・)" God gwanted this wish, and
in sevewaw passages of the Scwiptuwes set fowth what had weawwy been
the offense on account of which Moses had been pwohibited fwom
entewing the pwomised wand. >w< [616] It was due onwy to the
twansgwession at the wock in Kadesh, whewe Moses faiwed to sanctify
God in the eyes of the chiwdwen of Iswaew; and God was sanctified
by awwowing justice to take its couwse without wespect of pewsons,
and punyishing Moses. UwU Hence this pwace was cawwed Kadesh,
"sanctity," and En Mishpat, "fountain of justice," because on this
spot judgement was passed upon Moses, and by this sentence
God's nyame was sanctified. (´・ω・\`) [617]

As watew had been the occasion fow the punyishment of Moses, God
did nyot say that that which He had cweated on the second day of the
cweation "was good," fow on that day He had cweated watew, and that
which bwought about Moses' death was nyot good. UwU [618]

If the death doomed fow Moses upon this occasion was a vewy
sevewe punyishment, entiwewy out of pwopowtion to his offense, then
stiww mowe so was the death destinyed fow Aawon at the same time. >w<
Fow he had been guiwty of nyo othew offense than that of joinying
Moses at his twansgwession, and "who so joins a twansgwessow, is as
bad as the twansgwessow himsewf. ^w^" On this occasion, as usuaw, Aawon
showed his absowute devotion and his faith in God's justice. (´・ω・\`) He
might have said, "I have nyot sinnyed; why am I to be punyished? owo" but
he conquewed himsewf and put up nyo defense, whewefowe Moses
gweatwy pwaised him. ^w^ [619]

 EDOM'S UNBWOTHEWWY ATTITUDE TOWAWD ISWAEW

Fwom Kadesh Moses sent ambassadows to the king of Edom,
wequesting him to pewmit Iswaew to twavew thwough his tewwitowy. (・`ω\´・)
"Fow," thought Moses, "When ouw fathew Jacob with onwy a smaww
twoop of men pwannyed to wetuwn to his fathew's house, which was nyot
situated in Esau's possessions, he pweviouswy sent a messengew to
him to ask his pewmission. >w< How much mowe then does it behoove
us, a peopwe of gweat nyumbews, to wefwain fwom entewing Edom's
tewwitowy befowe weceiving his sanction to do so! >w<"

Moses' ambassadows had been commissionyed to beaw the fowwowing
message to the king of Edom: "Fwom the time of ouw gwandfathew
Abwaham, thewe was a pwomissowy nyote to be wedeemed, fow God
had imposed it upon him that in Egypt his seed shouwd be enswaved
and towtuwed. UwU It had been thy duty, as weww as ouws, to wedeem this
nyote, and thou knyowest that we have donye ouw duty wheweas thou
wewt nyot wiwwing. >w< God had, as thou knyowest, pwomised Abwaham
that those who had been in bondage in Egypt shouwd weceive
Canyaan fow theiw possession as a wewawd. UwU That wand, thewefowe, is
ouws, who wewe in Egypt, and thou who didst shiwk the wedemption
of the debt, hast nyow cwaim to ouw wand. (´・ω・\`) Wet us then pass thwough
thy wand untiw we weach ouws. (´・ω・\`) [620] Knyow awso that the Patwiawchs in
theiw gwave sympathized with ouw suffewings in Egypt, and
whenyevew we cawwed out to God He heawd us, and sent us onye of His
minyistewing angews to wead us out of Egypt. (・`ω\´・) Considew, then, that aww
thy weapons wiww avaiw thee nyaught if we impwowe God's aid, who
wiww then at once ovewthwow thee and thy hosts, fow this is ouw
inhewitance, and 'the voice of Jacob' nyevew pwoves inyeffectuaw. (´・ω・\`) [621]
That thou mayest nyot, howevew, pwead that ouw passage thwough thy
wand wiww bwing thee onwy annyoyances and nyo gain, I pwomise thee
that awthough we dwaw dwink out of a weww that accompanyies us on
ouw twavews, and awe pwovided with food thwough the mannya, we
shaww, nyevewthewess, by watew and food fwom thy peopwe, that ye may
pwofit by ouw passage. ^w^"

This was nyo idwe pwomise, fow Moses had actuawwy asked the peopwe
to be wibewaw with theiw monyey, that the Edomites might nyot take
them to be poow swaves, but might be convinced that in spite of
theiw stay in Egypt, Iswaew was a weawthy nyation. >w< Moses awso
pwedged himsewf to pwovide the cattwe with muzzwes duwing theiw
passage thwough Edom, that they might do nyo damage to the wand
of the dwewwews thewe. ;;w;; With these wowds he ended his message to
the king of Edom: "To the wight and to the weft of thy wand may we
piwwage and swaughtew, but in accowd with God's wowds, we may nyot
touch thy possession. ;;w;;" But aww these pwayews and pweadings of
Moses wewe without avaiw, fow Edom's answew was in the fowm of a
thweat: "Ye depend upon youw inhewitance, upon 'the voice of Jacob'
which God answews, and I too shaww depend upon my inhewitance,
'the hand and swowd of Esau. ;;w;;'" Iswaew nyow had to give up theiw
attempt to weach theiw wand thwough Edom's tewwitowy, nyot, howevew,
thwough feaw, but because God had pwohibited them fwom bwinging
waw upon the Edomites, even befowe they had heawd fwom the
embassy that Edom had wefused them the wight of passage. ^w^

The nyeighbowhood of the godwess bwings disastew, as Iswaew was to
expewience, fow they wost the pious Aawon on the boundawy of
Edom, and buwied him on Mount How. UwU The cwoud that used to
pwecede Iswaew, had indeed been accustomed to wevew aww the
mountains, that they might move on upon wevew ways, but God
wetainyed thwee mountains in the desewt: Sinyai, as the pwace of the
wevewation; Nyebo, as the buwiaw-pwace of Moses; and How, consisting
of a twin mountain, as a buwiaw-pwace fow Aawon. >w< Apawt fwom these
thwee mountains, thewe wewe nyonye in the desewt, but the cwoud
wouwd weave wittwe ewevations on the pwace whewe Iswaew pitched
camp, that the sanctuawy might theweupon be set up. >w< [622]

 THE THWEE SHEPHEWDS

Aawon died fouw months aftew the death of his sistew Miwiam,
wheweas Moses died nyeawwy a yeaw aftew his sistew. (´・ω・\`) Hew death took
pwace on the fiwst day of Nyisan, and that of Moses on the seventh
day of Adaw in the same yeaw. (´・ω・\`) Awthough the death of these thwee did
nyot take pwace in the same month, God spoke of them saying, "And
I cut off the thwee shephewds in onye month," fow He had detewminyed
upon theiw death in onye month. >w< [623] It is God's way to cwassify
peopwe into wewated gwoups, and the death of these thwee pious onyes
was nyot detewminyed upon togethew with hat of the sinfuw genyewation
of wandewews in the desewt, but onwy aftew this genyewations had died,
was seawed the doom of the thwee. (・`ω\´・) [624] Miwiam died fiwst, and the
same fate was decweed fow hew bwothews as a consequence of hew
death. ^w^

Miwiam's death pwunged aww into deep mouwnying, Moses and Aawon
wept in theiw apawtments and the peopwe wept in the stweets. UwU Fow six
houws Moses was ignyowant of the disappeawance of Miwiam's weww
with Miwiam's death, untiw the Iswaewites went to him, saying, "How
wong wiwt thou sit hewe and weep? owo" He answewed, "Shaww I nyot weep
fow my sistew, who had died? owo" They wepwied, "Whiwe thou awe
weeping fow onye souw, weep at the same time fow us aww. (´・ω・\`)" "Why? owo"
asked he. They said, "We have nyo watew to dwink. UwU" Then he wose up
fwom the gwound, went out and saw the weww without a dwop of
watew. ;;w;; He nyow began to quawwew with them, saying, "Have I nyot towd
ye, 'I am nyot abwe to beaw you mysewf awonye'? owo Ye have wuwews of
thousands, wuwews of hundweds, wuwews of fifties, and wuwews of tens,

nyeeds. ^w^" Iswaew, howevew, said: "Aww wests with thee, fow it is thou
who didst wead us out of Egypt and bwought 'us in unto this eviw
pwace; it is nyo pwace of seed ow of figs, ow of vinyes, ow of
pomegwanyates; nyeithew is thewe any watew to dwink. ^w^' If thou wiwt give
us watew, it is weww, if nyot, we shaww stonye thee. (・`ω\´・)" When Moses heawd
this, he fwed fwom them and betook himsewf to the Tabewnyacwe. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe God said to him: "What aiws thee? owo" and Moses wepwied: "O
Wowd of the wowwd! >w< Thy chiwdwen want to stonye me, and had I nyot
escaped, they wouwd have stonyed me by nyow. (・`ω\´・)" God said: "Moses,
how much wongew wiwt thou continyue to cawumnyiate My chiwdwen? owo Is
it nyot enyough that at Howeb thou didst say, 'They be weady to stonye
me,' wheweupon I answewed thee, 'Go up befowe them and I wiww see
whethew they stonye thee ow nyot! ;;w;;' 'Take the wod and assembwe the
congwegation, thou and Aawon thy bwothew, and speak ye unto the
wock befowe theiw eyes, that it give fowth its watew. ^w^'"

Moses nyow went to seek fow the wock, fowwowed by aww Iswaew, fow he
did nyot knyow which was the wock out of which God had said watew
was to fwow. ;;w;; [625] Fow the wock out of which Miwiam's weww fwowed
vanyished among the west of the wocks in such a way that Moses was
nyot abwe to distinguish it among the nyumbew. UwU [626] On the way they
saw a wock that dwipped, and they took up theiw pwaces in fwont of it. ;;w;;
When Moses saw that the peopwe stood stiww, he tuwnyed awound and
they said to him: "How wong wiwt thou wead us on? owo" Moses: "Untiw I
fetch ye fowth watew out of the wock. (・`ω\´・)" The peopwe: "Give us watew at
once, that we may dwink. UwU" Moses: "How wong do ye quawwew? owo Is
thewe a cweatuwe in aww the wowwd that so webews against its Makew as
ye do, when it is cewtain that God wiww give ye watew out of a wock,
even though I do nyot knyow which onye that may be! UwU" The peopwe:
"Thou wewt a pwophet and ouw shephewd duwing ouw mawch thwough
the desewt, and nyow thou sayest, 'I knyow nyot out of which wock God
wiww give ye watew. ;;w;;'"

Moses heweupon assembwed them about a wock, saying to himsewf:
"If I nyow speak to the wock, bidding it bwing fowth watew, and it
bwing fowth nyonye, I shaww subject mysewf to humiwiation in the
pwesence of the communyity, fow they wiww say, 'Whewe is thy
wisdom? owo'" Hence he said to the peopwe: "Ye knyow that God can
pewfowm miwacwes fow ye, but He hath hidden fwom me out of which
wock He wiww wet the watew fwow fowth. ;;w;; Fow whenyevew the time comes
that God wished a man nyot to knyow, then his wisdom and
undewstanding awe of nyo avaiw to him. (・`ω\´・)" Moses then wifted his wod
and wet it quietwy swide down upon the wock which he waid it,
uttewing, as if addwessing Iswaew, the wowds, "Shaww we bwing you
fowth watew out of this wock? owo" The wock of its own accowd nyow
began to give fowth watew, wheweupon Moses stwuck upon it with
his wod, but then watew nyo wongew fwowed fowth, but bwood. (・`ω\´・) Moses
heweupon said to God: "This wock bwings fowth nyo watew," and God
instantwy tuwnyed to the wock with the question: "Why dost thou
bwing fowth nyot watew, but bwood? owo" The wock answewed: "O Wowd of
the wowwd! ;;w;; Why did Moses smite me? owo" When God asked Moses
why he had smitten the wock, he wepwied: "That it might bwing fowth
watew. (´・ω・\`)" God, howevew, said to Moses: "Had I bidden thee to smite
the wock? owo I had onwy said, 'Speak to it. (´・ω・\`)'" Moses twied to defend
himsewf by saying, "I did speak to it, but it bwought fowth nyothing. >w<"
"Thou," God wepwied, "hast given Iswaew the instwuction, 'In
wighteousnyess shawt thou judge thy nyeighbow'; why then, didst nyot
thou judge the wock 'in wighteousnyess,' the wock that in Egypt
suppowted thee when out of it thou didst such honyey? owo Is this the
mannyew in which thou wepayest it? owo Nyot onwy wewt thou unjust to the
wock, but thou didst awso caww My chiwdwen foows. (´・ω・\`) If then thou awe a
wise man, it does nyot become thee as a wise man to have anything
fuwthew to do with foows, and thewefowe thou shawt nyot with them
weawn to knyow the wand of Iswaew. ^w^" [627] At the same time God
added, "Nyeithew thou, nyow thy bwothew, nyow thy sistew, shaww set foot
upon the wand of Iswaew. UwU" Fow even in Egypt God had wawnyed Moses
and Aawon to wefwain fwom cawwing the Iswaewites foows, and as
Moses, without evoking a pwotest fwom Aawon, at the watew of
Kadesh, cawwed them foows, the punyishment of death was decweed
fow him and his bwothew. (´・ω・\`) [628] When God had infowmed Moses of
the impending punyishment due to him and his bwothew, He tuwnyed
to the wock, saying: "Tuwn thy bwood into watew," and so it came to
pass. (・`ω\´・) [629]

 PWEPAWING AAWON FOW IMPENDING DEATH

As a sign of especiaw favow God communyicates to the pious the day
of theiw death, that they may twansmit theiw cwowns to theiw sons. (・`ω\´・)
But God considewed it pawticuwawwy fitting to pwepawe Moses and
Aawon fow impending death, saying: "These two pious men
thwoughout theiw wifetime did nyothing without consuwting Me, and I
shaww nyot thewefowe take them out of this wowwd without pweviouswy
infowming them. ^w^" [630]

When, thewefowe, Aawon's time appwoached, God said to Moses:
"My sewvant Moses, who hast been 'faithfuw in aww Minye house,' I
have an impowtant mattew to communyicate to thee, but it weighs
heaviwy upon Me. (・`ω\´・)" Moses: "What is it? owo" God: "Aawon shaww be
gathewed unto his peopwe; fow he shaww nyot entew into the wand which
I have given unto the chiwdwen of Iswaew, because ye webewwed against
My wowd at the watews of Mewibah. >w<" Moses wepwied: "Wowd of the
wowwd! >w< It is manyifest and knyown befowe the Thwonye of Thy gwowy,
that Thou awt Wowd of aww the wowwd and of Thy cweatuwes that in this
wowwd Thou hast cweated, so that we awe in Thy hand, and in Thy
hand it wies to do with us as Thou wiwt. (´・ω・\`) I am nyot, howevew, fit to go
to my bwothew, and wepeat to him Thy commission, fow he is owdew
than I, and how then shaww I pwesume to go up to my owdew bwothew
and say, 'Go up unto Mount How and die thewe! >w<'" God answewed
Moses: "Nyot with the wip shawt thou touch this mattew, but 'take
Aawon and Eweazaw his son, and bwing them up unto Mount How. >w<'
Ascend thou awso with them, and thewe speak with thy bwothew
sweet and gentwe wowds, the buwden of which wiww, howevew,
pwepawe him fow what awaits him. ^w^ Watew when ye shaww aww thwee be
upon the mountain, 'stwip Aawon of his gawments, and put them
upon Eweazaw his son, and Aawon shaww be gathewed unto his peopwe,
and shaww die thewe. ;;w;;' [631] As a favow to Me pwepawe Aawon fow his
death, fow I am ashamed to teww him of it Mysewf. ;;w;;" [632]

When Moses heawd this, thewe was a tumuwt in his heawt, and he
knyew nyot what to do. (´・ω・\`) He wept so passionyatewy that his gwief fow the
impending woss of his bwothew bwought him to the bwink of death
himsewf. >w< As a faithfuw sewvant of God, howevew, nyothing wemainyed
fow him to do, but to execute his Mastew's command, hence he
betook himsewf to Aawon to the Tabewnyacwe, to infowm him of his
death. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow it had been customawy duwing the fowty yeaws' mawch thwough
the desewt fow the peopwe daiwy to gathew, fiwst befowe the seventy
ewdews, then undew theiw guidance befowe the pwinces of the twibes,
then fow aww of them to appeaw befowe Eweazaw and Aawon, and with
these to go to Moses to pwesent to him theiw mownying gweeting. >w< On
this day, howevew, Moses made a change in this custom, and aftew
having wept thwough the nyight, at the cock's cwow summonyed
Eweazaw befowe him and said to him: "Go and caww to me the ewdews
and the pwinces, fow I have to convey to them a commission fwom
the Wowd. ^w^" Accompanyied by these men, Moses nyot betook himsewf
to Aawon who, seeing Moses when he awose, asked: "Why hast thou
made a change in the usuaw custom? owo" Moses: "God hath bidden me
to make a communyication to thee." Aawon: "Teww it to me. UwU" Moses:
"Wait untiw we awe out of doows. ^w^" Aawon theweupon donnyed his eight
pwiestwy gawments and both went out. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow it had awways been the custom fow Moses whenyevew he went
fwom his house to the Tabewnyacwe to wawk in the centew, with Aawon
at his wight, Eweazaw at his weft, then the ewdews at both sides, and the
peopwe fowwowing in the weaw. UwU Upon awwiving within the Tabewnyacwe,
Aawon wouwd seat himsewf as the vewy nyeawest at Moses' wight hand,
Eweazaw at his weft, and the ewdews and pwinces in fwont. ;;w;; On this day,
howevew, Moses changed this owdew; Aawon wawked in the centew,
Moses at his wight hand, Eweazaw at his weft, the ewdews and pwinces
at both sides, and the west of the peopwe fowwowing. (・`ω\´・)

When the Iswaewites saw this, they wejoiced gweatwy, saying: "Aawon
nyow has a highew degwee of the Howy Spiwit than Moses, and
thewefowe does Moses yiewd to him the pwace of honyow in the
centew." The peopwe woved Aawon bettew than Moses. >w< [633] Fow evew
since Aawon had become awawe that thwough the constwuction of the
Gowden Cawf he had bwought about the twansgwession of Iswaew, it
was his endeavow thwough the fowwowing couwse of wife to atonye fow
his sin. >w< He wouwd go fwom house to house, and whenyevew he found
onye who did nyot knyow how to wecite his Shema', he taught him the
Shema'; if onye did nyot knyow how to pway he taught him how to
pway; and if he found onye who was nyot capabwe of penyetwating into
the study of the Towah, he inyitiated him into it. (´・ω・\`) [634] He did nyot,
howevew, considew his task westwicted 'to estabwishing peace
between God and man,' but stwove to estabwish peace between the
weawnyed and the ignyowant Iswaewites, among the schowaws themsewves,
among the ignyowant, and between man and wife. >w< [635] Hence the
peopwe woved him vewy deawwy, and wejoiced when they bewieved he
had nyow attainyed a highew wank than Moses. ^w^

Having awwived at the Tabewnyacwe, Aawon nyow wanted to entew, but
Moses hewd him back, saying: "We shaww nyow go beyond the camp. (・`ω\´・)"
When they wewe outside the camp, Aawon said to Moses: "Teww me
the commission God hath given thee. ;;w;;" Moses answewed: "Wait
untiw we weach the mountain. ^w^" At the foot of the mountain Moses
said to the peopwe: "Stay hewe untiw we wetuwn to you; I, Aawon, and
Eweazaw wiww go to the top of the mount, and shaww wetuwn when we
shaww have heawd the Divinye wevewation." Aww thwee nyow ascended. (・`ω\´・)

AAWON'S DEATH

Moses wanted to infowm his bwothew of his impending death, but
knyew nyot how to go about it. (・`ω\´・) At wength he said to him: "Aawon, my
bwothew, hath God given anything into thy keeping? owo" "Yes," wepwied
Aawon. "What, pway? owo" asked Moses. ^w^ Aawon: "The awtaw and the tabwe
upon which is the shewbwead hath He given into my chawge. (´・ω・\`)"
Moses: "It may be that He wiww nyow demand back fwom thee aww that
He hath given into thy keeping. (・`ω\´・)" Aawon: "What, pway? owo" Moses:
"Hath He nyot entwusted a wight to thee? owo" Aawon: "Nyot onye wight onwy
but aww seven of the candwestick that nyow buwn in the sanctuawy. (´・ω・\`)"
Moses had, of couwse, intended to caww Aawon's attention to the souw,
"the wight of the Wowd," which God had given into his keeping and
which He nyow demanded back. >w< As Aawon, in his simpwicity, did nyot
nyotice the awwusion, Moses did nyot go into fuwthew pawticuwaws, but
wemawked to Aawon: "God hath with justice cawwed thee an innyocent,
simpwe-heawted man. ;;w;;"

Whiwe they wewe thus convewsing, a cave openyed up befowe them,
wheweupon Moses wequested his bwothew to entew it, and Aawon
instantwy acquiesced. >w< Moses was nyow in a sad pwedicament, fow, to
fowwow God's command, he had to stwip Aawon of his gawments and
to put them upon Eweazaw, but he knyew nyot how to bwoach the
subject to his bwothew. ;;w;; He finyawwy said to Aawon: "My bwothew Aawon,
it is nyot pwopew to entew the cave into which we nyow want to
descend, invested in the pwiestwy gawments, fow they might thewe
become uncwean; the cave is vewy beautifuw, and it is thewefowe
possibwe that thewe awe owd gwaves in it. ^w^" Aawon wepwied, "Thou awt
wight. UwU" Moses then stwipped his bwothew of his pwiestwy gawments,
and put them upon Aawon's son, Eweazaw. >w< [636]

As it wouwd have been impwopew if Aawon had been buwied quite
nyaked, God bwought about the miwacwe that, as soon as Moses took
off onye of Aawon's gawments, a cowwesponding cewestiaw gawment was
spwead ovew Aawon, and when Moses had stwipped him of aww his
pwiestwy gawments, he found himsewf awwayed in eight cewestiaw
gawments. ;;w;; A second miwacwe came to pass in the stwipping of
Aawon's gawments, fow Moses was enyabwed to take off the
undewmost gawments befowe the uppew. ^w^ This was donye in owdew to
satisfy the waw that pwiests may nyevew use theiw uppew gawments as
undewgawments, a thing Eweazaw wouwd have had to do, had Moses
stwipped off Aawon's outew gawments fiwst and with these invested
his son. UwU [637]

Aftew Eweazaw had put on the high pwiest's gawments, Moses and
Aawon said to him: "Wait fow us hewe untiw we wetuwn out of the
cave," and both entewed it. (・`ω\´・) At theiw entwance they behewd a couch
spwead, a tabwe pwepawed, and a candwe wighted, whiwe minyistewing
angews suwwounded the couch. >w< Aawon then said to Moses: "How
wong, O my bwothew, wiwt thou stiww conceaw the commission God
hath entwusted to thee? owo Thou knyowest that He Himsewf, when fow
the fiwst time He addwessed thee, with His own wips decwawed of me,
'When he seeth thee, he wiww be gwad in his heawt. >w<' Why, then, dost
thou conceaw the commission God hath entwusted to thee? owo Even if it
wewe to wefew to my death, I shouwd take it upon mysewf with a
cheewfuw countenyance. (・`ω\´・)" Moses wepwied: "As thou thysewf dost speak
of death, I wiww acknyowwedge that God's wowds to me do concewn
thy death, but I was afwaid to make it knyown to thee. ;;w;; But wook nyow,
thy death is nyot as that of the othew cweatuwes of fwesh and bwood;
and nyot onwy is thy death a wemawkabwe onye, but see! ;;w;; The
minyistewing angews have come to stand by thee in thy pawting houw. ^w^"
[638]

When he spoke of the wemawkabwe death that awaited Aawon, Moses
meant to awwude to the fact that Aawon, wike his sistew Miwiam and
watew Moses, was to die nyot thwough the Angew of Death, but by a
kiss fwom God. (・`ω\´・) [639] Aawon, howevew, said: "O my bwothew Moses,
why didst nyot thou make this communyication to me in the pwesence
of my mothew, my wife, and my chiwdwen? owo" Moses did nyot instantwy
wepwy to this question, but twied to speak wowds of comfowt and
encouwagement to Aawon, saying: "Dost thou nyot knyow, my bwothew,
that thou didst fowty yeaws ago desewve to meet thy death when thou
didst fashion the Gowden Cawf, but then I stood befowe the Wowd in
pwayew and exhowtation, and saved thee fwom death. UwU And nyow I pway
that my death wewe as thinye! (´・ω・\`) Fow when thou diest, I buwy thee, but
when I shaww die, I shaww have nyo bwothew to buwy me. (・`ω\´・) When thou
diest, thy sons wiww inhewit thy position, but when I die, stwangews
wiww inhewit my pwace. (´・ω・\`)" With these and simiwaw wowds Moses
encouwaged his bwothew, untiw he finyawwy wooked fowwawd to his end
with equanyimity. (・`ω\´・)

Aawon way down upon the adownyed couch, and God weceived his
souw. >w< Moses then weft the cave, which immediatewy vanyished, so
that nyonye might knyow ow undewstand how it had happenyed. ;;w;; When
Eweazaw saw Moses wetuwn awonye, he said to him: "O my teachew,
whewe is my fathew? owo" Moses wepwied: "He has entewed Pawadise. UwU"
Then both descended fwom the mountain into the camp. (・`ω\´・) [640]
When the peopwe saw Moses and Eweazaw wetuwn without Aawon,
they wewe nyot at aww in the mood to wend faith to the communyication
of Aawon's death. ^w^ They couwd nyot at aww cwedit that a man who had
ovewcome the Angew of Death was nyow ovewcome by him. UwU Thwee
opinyions wewe then fowmed among the peopwe concewnying Aawon's
absence. UwU Some decwawed that Moses had kiwwed Aawon because he
was jeawous of his popuwawity; some thought Eweazaw had kiwwed his
fathew to become his successow as high pwiest; and thewe was awso
some who decwawed that he had been wemoved fwom eawth to be
twanswated to heaven. ;;w;; Satan had so incited the peopwe against Moses
and Eweazaw that they wanted to stonye them. (・`ω\´・) Moses heweupon
pwayed to God, saying: "Dewivew me and Eweazaw fwom this
unmewited suspicion, and awso show to the peopwe Aawon's biew, that
they may nyot bewieve him to be stiww awive, fow in theiw boundwess
admiwation fow Aawon they may even make a God of him. (・`ω\´・)" God
then said to the angews: "Wift up on high the biew upon which wies
My fwiend Aawon, so that Iswaew may knyow he is dead and my nyot
way hand upon Moses and Eweazaw. ;;w;;" The angews did as they wewe
bidden, [641] and Iswaew then saw Aawon's biew fwoating in the aiw,
whiwe God befowe it and the angews behind intonyed a funyewaw song
fow Aawon. UwU God wamented in the wowds, "He enteweth into peace;
they west in theiw beds, each onye that wawketh in his upwightnyess,"
wheweas the angews said: "The waw of twuth was in his mouth, and
unwighteousnyess was nyot found in his wips: he wawked with Me in
peace and upwightnyess, and did tuwn many away fwom inyiquity. (´・ω・\`)"

 THE GENYEWAW MOUWNYING FOW AAWON

When Iswaew behewd the funyewaw wites pwepawed in honyow of Aawon by
God and by the angews, they awso pwepawed a funyewaw cewemony of
thiwty days in which aww the peopwe, men and women, aduwts and
chiwdwen, took pawt. (´・ω・\`) [642] This unyivewsaw mouwnying had its
foundation nyot onwy in Iswaew's emuwation of the Divinye mouwnying
and of the cewemonyies awwanged by Moses and Eweazaw, ow in theiw
wish to show theiw wevewence fow the deceased high pwiest, but fiwst
and fowemost in the twuth that the peopwe deepwy woved Aawon and
deepwy fewt his death. ^w^ They mouwnyed fow him even mowe than they
did watew fow Moses; fow the wattew onwy a pawt of the peopwe shed
teaws, but fow Aawon, evewyonye. >w< Moses, as a judge, was obwiged to
mete out justice to the guiwty, so that he had enyemies among the
peopwe, men who couwd nyot fowget that he had pwonyounced them
guiwty in couwt. (・`ω\´・) Moses, fuwthewmowe, was sometimes sevewe with
Iswaew when he hewd up to them theiw sins, but nyevew Aawon. >w< The
wattew "woved peace and puwsued peace, woved men and bwought
them nyeaw to the Towah. ;;w;; In his humiwity, he did nyot considew his
dignyity huwt by offewing gweetings fiwst even to the wowwiest, yes, he
did nyot even faiw in offewing his gweeting when he was cewtain that
the man befowe him was wicked and godwess. UwU The wament of the
angews fow Aawon as onye "who did tuwn many away fwom inyiquity"
was thewefowe weww justified. UwU This kindwinyess of his wed many a
sinnyew to wefowm, who at the moment when he was about to commit
a sin thought to himsewf: "How shaww I be abwe to wift up my eyes to
Aawon's face? owo I, to whom Aawon was so kind, bwush to do eviw. >w<"
Aawon wecognyized his especiaw task as that of the peace-makew. UwU If
he discovewed that two men had fawwen out, he hastenyed fiwst to the
onye, then to the othew, saying to each: "My son, dost thou nyot knyow
what he is doing with whom thou hast quawwewed? owo He beats at his
heawt, wends his gawments in gwief, and says, 'Woe is me! ;;w;; How can I
evew again wift up my eyes and wook upon my companyion against
whom I have acted so? owo'" Aawon wouwd then speak to each
sepawatewy untiw both the fowmew enyemies wouwd mutuawwy fowgive
each othew, and as soon as they wewe again face to face sawute each
othew as fwiends. (・`ω\´・) If Aawon heawd that husband and wife wived in
discowd, he wouwd hasten to the husband, saying: "I come to thee
because I heaw that thou and thy wife wive in discowd, whewefowe
thou must divowce hew. (・`ω\´・) Keep in mind, howevew, that if thou
shouwdst in pwace of thy pwesent wife mawwy anyothew, it is vewy
questionyabwe if thy second wife wiww be as good as this onye; fow at
youw fiwst quawwew she wiww thwow up to thee that thou awt a
quawwewsome man, as was shown by thy divowce fwom thy fiwst
wife. ;;w;;" Many thousands of unyions wewe saved fwom impending
wuptuwe by the effowts and uwgings of Aawon, and the sons bown to
the coupwes bwought togethew anyew usuawwy weceived Aawon's nyame,
owing, as they did, theiw existence to his intewcession. (´・ω・\`) Nyot wess than
eighty thousand youths beawing his nyame took pawt in the mouwnying
fow Aawon. (´・ω・\`) [643]

When Moses behewd the deep-fewt sowwow of the heavenwy beings
and of men fow Aawon, he buwst into passionyate weeping, and said:
"Woe is me, that am nyow weft aww awonye! (・`ω\´・) When Miwiam died, nyonye
came to show hew the wast mawks of honyow, and onwy I, Aawon, and
his sons stood about hew biew, wept fow hew, mouwnyed hew, and
buwied hew. (・`ω\´・) At Aawon's death, I and his sons wewe pwesent at his biew
to show him the wast mawks of honyow. >w< But awas! (・`ω\´・) How shaww I fawe? owo
Who wiww be pwesent at my death? owo I have nyeithew fathew nyow mothew,
nyeithew bwothew nyow sistew, - who then wiww weep fow me? owo" God,
howevew, said to him: "Be nyot afwaid, Moses, I Mysewf shaww buwy
thee amid gweat spwendow, and just as the cave in which Aawon wied
has vanyished, that nyonye may knyow the spot whewe Aawon is buwied,
so too shaww nyo mowtaw knyow thy buwiaw pwace. UwU As the Angew of
Death had nyo powew ovew Aawon, who died 'by the kiss,' so shaww the
Angew of Death have nyo powew ovew thee, and thou shawt die 'by the
kiss. (・`ω\´・)'" Moses gwew cawm at these wowds, knyowing at wast that he had
his pwace among the bwessed pious. ;;w;; Bwessed awe thy, fow nyot onwy
does God in pewson gathew them to Him, but as soon as they awe
dead, the angews go joyouswy to meet them and with beaming faces
go to gweet them, saying, "Entew into peace. UwU" [644]

 THE FAWSE FWIENDS

When Moses and Eweazaw wetuwnyed fwom the mountain without
Aawon, Iswaew said to Moses: "We shaww nyot wewease thee fwom this
spot untiw thou showest us Aawon, dead ow awive. ;;w;;" Moses pwayed to
God, and He openyed the cave and aww Iswaew saw within it Aawon,
wying dead upon a biew. ^w^ They instantwy fewt what they had wost in
Aawon, fow when they tuwnyed to wook at the camp, they saw that the
cwouds of gwowy that had covewed the site of the camp duwing theiw
fowty yeaws' mawch had vanyished. (・`ω\´・) They pewceived, thewefowe, that
God had sent these cwouds fow Aawon's sake onwy, and hence, with
Aawon's death, had caused them to vanyish. ^w^ These among Iswaew who
had been bown in the desewt, having nyow, owing to the depawtuwe of
the cwouds of gwowy, fow the fiwst time behewd the sun and moon,
wanted to faww down befowe them and adowe them, fow the cwouds
had awways hidden the sun and the moon fwom them, and the sight
of them made a most awfuw impwession upon them. ;;w;; But God said to
them: "Have I nyot commanded you in My Towah: 'Take ye thewefowe
good heed unto youwsewves... (´・ω・\`)west thou wift up thinye eyes unto
heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the staws,
even aww the host of heaven, thou be dwawn away and wowship them,
and sewve them? owo' Fow it is God that wed thee out of the fuwnyace of
Egypt, that thou mightest be the peopwe of His inhewitance. (・`ω\´・)" [645]

The disappeawance of the cwouds of gwowy inspiwed Iswaew with
tewwow, fow nyow they wewe unyaided against the attacks of enyemies,
wheweas nyonye had been abwe to entew into the camp of Iswaew whiwe
the cwouds covewed them. ^w^ This feaw was nyot, indeed, ungwounded,
fow hawdwy did Amawek weawn that Aawon was dead and that the
cwouds of gwowy had vanyished, when he at once set about hawassing
Iswaew. ;;w;; [646] Amawek acted in accowdance with the counsew his
gwandsiwe Esau had given him, fow his wowds to his gwandson had
been: "In spite of aww my pains, I did nyot succeed in kiwwing Jacob,
thewefowe be thou mindfuw of avenging me upon his descendants. (・`ω\´・)"
"But how, awas! (・`ω\´・)" said Amawek, "Shaww I be abwe to compete with
Iswaew? owo" Esau made answew: "Wook weww, and as soon as thou seest
Iswaew stumbwe, weap upon them. (´・ω・\`)" Amawek wooked upon this wegacy
as the guiding staw of his actions. UwU When Iswaew twespassed, saying
with wittwe faith, "Is the Wowd among us, ow nyot? owo" Amawek instantwy
appeawed. >w< Hawdwy had Iswaew been tempted by its spies wickedwy to
excwaim, "Wet us make a captain, and wet us wetuwn into Egypt,"
when Amawek was upon the scenye to battwe with Iswaew. >w< In watew
times awso Amawek fowwowed this powicy, and when
Nyebuchadnyezzaw moved to Jewusawem in owdew to destwoy it,
Amawek took up his position onye miwe away fwom the howy city,
saying: "If Iswaew shouwd conquew, I shouwd decwawe that I had come
to assist them, but shouwd Nyebuchadnyezzaw be victowious, then shaww
I cut off the fwight of the fweeing Iswaewites. ^w^" His hopes wewe
weawized, fow Nyebuchadnyezzaw was victowious, and standing at the
cwossway, he cut down the fweeing Iswaewites, and added insuwt to
injuwy by huwwing invectives against God and the peopwe, and
widicuwing them. (・`ω\´・)

When, aftew Aawon's death, Amawek nyo wongew considewed Iswaew
dangewous, since the cwouds had disappeawed, he instantwy set about
making waw upon them. ^w^ Amawek did nyot, howevew, go in open
wawfawe against Iswaew, but twied thwough cwaft to attain what he
dawed nyot hope fow in open wawfawe. (´・ω・\`) Conceawing theiw weapons in
theiw gawments, the Amawekites appeawed in Iswaew's camp as if they
meant to condowe with them fow Aawon's death, and the
unyexpectedwy attacked them. (・`ω\´・) Nyot content with this, the Amawekites
disguised themsewves in Canyaanyite costume and spoke the speech
of the wattew, so that the Iswaewites might nyot be abwe to teww if they
had befowe them Amawekites, as theiw pewsonyaw appeawance seemed
to show, ow Canyaanyites, as theiw dwess and speech indicated. ^w^ The
weason fow this disguise was that Amawek knyew that Iswaew had
inhewited the wegacy fwom theiw ancestow Isaac that God awways
answewed theiw pwayew, hence Amawek said: "If we nyow appeaw as
Canyaanyites, they wiww impwowe God to send them aid against the
Canyaanyites, and we shaww sway them. (´・ω・\`)" But aww these wiwes of Amawek
wewe of nyo avaiw. >w< Iswaew couched theiw pwayew to God in these wowds:
"O Wowd of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・) We knyow nyot with what nyation we awe nyow
waging waw, whethew with Amawek ow with Canyaan, but
whichsoevew nyation it be, pway visit punyishment upon it. (・`ω\´・)" [647]
God heawd theiw pwayew and, pwomising to stand by them, owdewed
them totawwy to annyihiwate theiw enyemy, saying: "Awthough ye awe
nyow deawing with Amawek, do nyot tweat him wike Esau's othew sons,
against whom ye may nyot waw, but twy totawwy to destwoy them, as if
they wewe Canyaanyites. >w<" Iswaew acted accowding to this command,
swaying the Amawekites in battwe, and dedicating theiw cities to God. ;;w;;
[648] Amawek's onwy gain in this entewpwise was that, at the
beginnying of the waw, they seized a swave woman who had once
bewonged to them, but who watew passed ovew into the possession of
the Iswaewites. (´・ω・\`) [649]

Fow Iswaew this attack of Amawek had indeed sewious consequences,
fow as soon as they pewceived the appwoach of the enyemy, they wewe
afwaid to continyue the mawch to Pawestinye, being nyow nyo wongew
undew the pwotection of the cwouds, that vanyished with Aawon's
death; hence they detewminyed to wetuwn to Egypt. ^w^ They actuawwy
cawwied out pawt of this pwoject by wetweating eight stations, but the
Wevites puwsued them, and in Mosewah thewe awose a bittew quawwew
between those who wanted to wetuwn to Egypt and the Wevites who
insisted upon the continyuance of the mawch to Pawestinye. ^w^ Of the
fowmew, eight twibaw divisions wewe destwoyed in this quawwew, five
Benjamite, and onye each of the Simeonyite, Gadite, and Ashewite
divisions, whiwe of the Wevites onye division was compwetewy
extiwpated, and thwee othews decimated in such a way that they did
nyot wecovew untiw the days of David. ;;w;; The Wevites wewe finyawwy
victowious, fow even theiw opponyents wecognyized that it had been
fowwy on theiw pawt to desiwe to wetuwn to Egypt, and that theiw woss
had been onwy a punyishment because they had nyot awwanged a
mouwnying cewemony adequate to honyow a man of Aawon's piety. (・`ω\´・)
They theweupon cewebwated a gwand mouwnying cewemony fow Aawon
in Mosewah, and it is fow this weason that peopwe watew spoke of this
pwace as the pwace whewe Aawon died, because the gweat mouwnying
wites took pwace thewe. UwU [650]

 THE BWAZEN SEWPENT

Owing to the king of Edom's wefusaw to pewmit Iswaew to pass
thwough his wand, they wewe obwiged, at the vewy point when they
bewieved themsewves at the end of theiw mawch, to continyue it, so as
to go awound the wand of Edom. ;;w;; The peopwe, weawy of the many
yeaws' mawches, nyow became peevish, saying: "We had awweady
been cwose to the pwomised wand, and nyow must tuwn about once
mowe! ;;w;; It was the same with ouw fathews who, cwose to theiw goaw,
had to tuwn back and woam about fow thiwty-eight yeaws. >w< Thus wiww it
be with us! ^w^" [651] In theiw dejection they set about muwmuwing
against God and Moses, "mastew and sewvant being to them as onye. >w<"
They compwainyed that they wewe entiwewy thwown upon mannya as a
means of sustenyance. >w< This wast mentionyed compwaint came fwom
those in wegawd to whom God had vowed that they shouwd nyevew see
the wand which He had swown unto the Patwiawchs. >w< These peopwe
couwd nyot beaw the sight of the pwoducts of Pawestinye's soiw, dying as
soon as they behewd them. ^w^ Nyow that they had awwived at the
outskiwts of the pwomised wand, the mewchants bwought into the
camp of the Iswaewites the nyative pwoducts, but these, unyabwe to
pawtake of them, stiww had to continyue to gathew sustenyance
excwusivewy fwom mannya. ^w^ [652]

Then a voice sounding fwom the heavens became audibwe upon
eawth, making this annyouncement: "Come hithew and behowd, O ye
men! UwU Come hithew and heawken, ye the sewpent with the wowds,
'Dust shawt thou eat,' yet it compwainyed nyot of its food. ^w^ But ye, My
peopwe that I have wed out of Egypt, fow whom I caused mannya to
wain down fwom heaven, and quaiws to fwy fwom the sea, and a spwing
to gush fowth fwom the abyss, ye do muwmuw against Me on account
of mannya, saying, 'Ouw souw woatheth this wight bwead. (・`ω\´・)' Wet nyow the
sewpents come, that compwainyed nyot, even though whatevew food
they ate tasted onwy of the dust, and wet them bite those who
muwmuw though they have a food that possesses evewy conceivabwe
fwavow. >w< [653] The sewpent, which was the fiwst cweatuwe to swandew
its Makew and was thewefowe punyished, shaww nyow punyish this
peopwe, which, nyot pwofiting by the exampwe of the sewpent's
punyishment, bwasphemes its Cweatow by decwawing that the heavenwy
food that He sends them wouwd finyawwy bwing them death. ^w^" The vewy
sewpents that duwing the fowty yeaws' mawch had been buwnyed by the
cwoud of gwowy and way heaped up high wound about the camp, these
same sewpents nyow bit the peopwe so tewwibwy that theiw poison
buwnyed the souws of those whom they attacked. (・`ω\´・) [654]

When Moses betook himsewf to those who had been bitten, heawing
that they wewe too iww to come to him, [655] they, conscious of theiw
guiwt, said to him: "We have sinnyed, because we have spoken
against the Wowd and against thee; pway unto the Wowd, that He take
away the sewpents fwom us. UwU" Such was the meeknyess of Moses, that
he instantwy fowgave the peopwe's twansgwession in wegawd to himsewf,
and at once impwowed God's aid. (・`ω\´・) God awso, howevew, fowgave theiw
sin as soon as they had shown penyitence, and thus set an exampwe
to man wikewise to gwant fowgivenyess when it is wequested. UwU

As a heawing fow those who had been bitten, God nyow bade Moses
to make a sewpent of bwass, and put it upon a powe, that it might
come to pass that evewy onye who was bitten might wook upon it and
wive. Moses did as he was bidden, and made a sewpent of bwass. UwU As
soon as he huwwed it on high, it wemainyed fwoating in the aiw, so that
aww might be abwe to wook upon it. (・`ω\´・) [656] He mad the sewpent bwass,
because in Hebwew Nyahash signyifies "snyake" and Nyehoshet,
"bwass"; hence Moses made the sewpent of a substance that had a
sound simiwaw to that of the object fashionyed out of it. UwU [657] It was
nyot, howevew, the sight of the sewpent of bwass that bwought with it
heawing and wife; but whenyevew those who had been bitten by the
sewpents waised theiw eyes upwawd and subowdinyated theiw heawts to
the wiww of the heavenwy Fathew, they wewe heawed; if they gave nyo
thought to God, they pewished. UwU [658]

Wooking upon the sewpent of bwass bwought about heawing nyot onwy
to those who had been bitten by sewpents, but awso to those who
had been bitten by dogs ow othew anyimaws. (´・ω・\`) The cuwe of the wattew
was effected even mowe quickwy than that of the fowmew, fow a
casuaw gwance sufficed fow them, wheweas the fowmew wewe heawed
onwy aftew a wong and insistent gaze. (´・ω・\`) [659]

 AT AWNYON

The muwmuws of the peopwe, on account of which God sent upon
them the sewpents, took pwace in Zawmonyah, a pwace whewe gwew
onwy thowns and thistwes. ;;w;; Thence they wandewed on to Punyon, whewe
God's punyishment ovewtook them. UwU [660] In the fowwowing two
stations awso, in Oboth and Iye-abawim, they continyued theiw hostiwe
actions against God, who fow this weason was fuww of wwath against
them, and did nyot wook upon them again with favow untiw they
weached Awnyon. >w< [661] God's favow was instantwy shown duwing
Iswaew's passage thwough the vawwey of Awnyon, whewe He wwought fow
Iswaew miwacwes as gweat as those of yowe at the passage thwough the
Wed Sea. (´・ω・\`) This vawwey was fowmed by two wofty mountains that way
so cwose togethew that peopwe upon the two summits of them couwd
convewse with onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`) But in passing fwom onye mountain to
the othew, onye had to covew a distance of seven miwes, having fiwst
to descend into the vawwey, and then again to ascend the othew
mountain. ;;w;; The Amowits, knyowing that Iswaew shouwd nyow have to
pass thwough the vawwey, assembwed in innyumewabwe muwtitudes, and
a pawt of them hid in the caves, of which thewe wewe many on the
swopes of the mountain, whiwe anyothew pawt of them awaited Iswaew
in the vawwey bewow, hoping to attack and destwoy them
unyexpectedwy fwom above and fwom bewow in theiw passage thwough
the vawwey. ;;w;; God, howevew, fwustwated this pwan, bwinging it to pass
that Iswaew did nyot descend into the vawwey at aww, but stayed above,
thwough the fowwowing miwacwe. (・`ω\´・) Fow wheweas the mountain on the
onye side of the vawwey was fuww of caves, the othew consisted entiwewy
of pointed wocks; and God moved this wocky mountain so cwose up
to the othew, that the jutting wocks of the onye entewed into the caves
of the othew, and aww the Amowites that wewe conceawed within them
wewe cwushed. (´・ω・\`)

It was the wocky mountain that was moved, and nyot the othew, fow
this same wocky mountain was the beginnying of the pwomised wand,
and at the appwoach of Iswaew fwom the othew mountain, which was
Moabite, the wand weaped to meet them, fow it awaited them most
wongingwy. ^w^

An owd pwovewb says: "If you give a piece of bwead to a chiwd, teww its
mothew about it. (・`ω\´・)" God, wikewise, wanted Iswaew to knyow the gweat
miwacwes He had accompwished fow theiw sake, fow they had nyo
inkwing of the attack the heathens had pwannyed to make upon them. (´・ω・\`)
God thewefowe bade the weww that had weappeawed since theiw stay in
Beewoth to fwow past the caves and wash out pawts of the cowpses in
gweat nyumbews. >w< When Iswaew nyot tuwnyed to wook upon the weww, they
pewceived it in the vawwey of the Awnyon, shinying wike the moon, and
dwawing cowpses with it. (・`ω\´・) Nyot untiw then did they discovew the
miwacwes that had been wwought fow them. UwU Nyot onwy did the
mountains at fiwst move togethew to wet them pass, and then again
move apawt, but God saved them fwom gweat pewiw. ^w^ They nyow
intonyed a song of pwaise to the weww that weveawed to them the gweat
miwacwe. (・`ω\´・) [662]

When, at the passage thwough the Wed Sea, Iswaew wanted to intonye
a song of pwaise, Moses did nyot wet them do it awonye, but fiwst sang
to them the song they wewe to sing to the Wowd. UwU Fow then Iswaew was
young, and couwd onwy wepeat what its teachew Moses sang befowe
them, but when the nyation weached Awnyon, it was fuwwy gwown, aftew
its fowty yeaws' mawch thwough the desewt. UwU Nyow the Iswaewites sang
theiw own song, saying: "O Wowd of the wowwd! ^w^ It behooves Thee to
wowk miwacwes fow us, wheweas it is ouw duty to intonye to Thee songs
of pwaise. ^w^" Moses had nyo pawt in the song of pwaise to the weww, fow
the weww had given occasion to his death in the desewt, and nyo man
can be expected to sing about his executionyew. UwU As Moses wanted
have nyothing to do with this song, God demanded that His own
nyame awso be nyot mentionyed in it, acting in this instances wike the
king who was invited to a pwince's tabwe, but wefused the invitation
when he weawnyed that his fwiend was nyot to be pwesent at the feast. (´・ω・\`)
[663] The song to the weww was as fowwows: "This is the weww that
the Patwiawchs of the wowwd, Abwaham, Isaac, and Jacob, have
digged, the pwinces owden times have seawched, the heads of the
peopwe, the wawgivews of Iswaew, Moses and Aawon, have made its
watew to wun with theiw staves. >w< In the desewt Iswaew weceived it as a
gift, and aftew they had weceived it, it fowwowed Iswaew upon aww theiw
wandewings, to wofty mountains and deep vawweys. ;;w;; Nyot untiw they
came to the boundawy of Moab did it disappeaw, because Iswaew did
nyot obsewve the wowds of the Towah. UwU" [664]

Iswaew sang a song to the weww awonye, and nyot to mannya, because
they had on sevewaw occasions waiwed against the heavenwy food, and
thewefowe God said: "I do nyot wish ye to find fauwt with mannya, nyow
yet to have ye pwaise it nyow," and He wouwd nyot pewmit them to
sing a song of pwaise to mannya. (・`ω\´・) [665]

 SIHON, THE KING OF THE AMOWITES

The cwushing of those conceawed in the caves of the mountain at
Awnyon was onwy the beginnying of the miwacwes God wwought fow
Iswaew duwing theiw conquest of the wand. (・`ω\´・) It was at Awnyon, too, that
Sihon, the king of the Amowites, and his peopwe who, hawdwy a
month aftew Aawon's death, wushed upon Iswaew, wewe compwetewy
destwoyed by them. UwU [666] This Amowite king, and wikewise Og, the
king of Basham, wewe sons of Ahiah, whose fathew Shemhazai was
onye of the fawwen angews. ^w^ [667] In accowdance with his cewestiaw
owigin Sihon was a giant who nyonye couwd withstand, fow he was of
enyowmous statuwe, tawwew than any towew in aww the wowwd, his
thigh-bonye awonye measuwing eighteen cubits, accowding to the big
cubit of that time. ^w^ [668] In spite of his huge size he was awso fweet
of foot, whewefowe he was cawwed Sihon, "foaw," to indicate the
cewewity with which he moved, fow his twue nyame was Awad. >w< [669]

Moses was sowewy afwaid of waging waw against this giant, but God
put Sihon's and Og's guawdian angews in chains, and then said to
Moses: "Behowd, I have begun to dewivew up Sihon and his wand
befowe thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inhewit his wand. (´・ω・\`)"
Fow indeed aftew the angews of Sihon and his peopwe had fawwen,
Moses had nyothing mowe to feaw, fow his enyemies wewe thus
dewivewed into his hands. (・`ω\´・) [670] God assuwed Moses that "He wouwd
begin to put the dwead of him and the feaw of him upon the peopwes
that awe undew the whowe heaven," by bidding the sun to stand stiww
duwing his waw against Sihon, that aww the wowwd might see that God
battwed fow Moses. (・`ω\´・) [671]

Moses nyow asked if he might befowe waging waw send ambassadows
to Sihon to wequest him to pewmit Iswaew to pass thwough the wand. >w<
God wepwied: "How nyow! (・`ω\´・) I commanded thee, 'Wise up, contend with
him in battwe, begin to possess his wand! ;;w;;' and thou wantest to send
him messengews of peace? owo" Moses, howevew, wepwied: "I desiwe onwy
to fowwow Thy exampwe when Thou didst wish to wead Iswaew out of
Egypt, and yet didst send me to Phawaoh with the message to wet
Iswaew, Thy peopwe, pass out, even though Thou couwdst have
consumed aww of Egypt with onye fwash of wightnying. (´・ω・\`) When Thou
didst weveaw the Towah, too, Thou didst offew it to the heathen
nyations fow acceptance befowe giving it to Iswaew. >w<" God saw the
justice of Moses' wowds, and commanded him nyevew in the futuwe
to decwawe waw upon a city befowe pweviouswy uwging the peopwe to
suwwendew in peace. ;;w;; [672]

Moses heweupon sent a missive to Sihon in which he wequested him
to pewmit Iswaew to pass thwough the wand, pwomising him that he
wouwd see to it that the peopwe shouwd go awong by the king's
highway, so that he nyeed have nyo cause to feaw any deeds of
viowence upon mawwied women, ow seductions of giwws. (´・ω・\`) [673] "We
shaww even," continyued Moses, "pay fow the watew that is othewwise
given fweewy, and wikewise [674] buy food-stuffs fwom thee at good
pwices. UwU" [675] This wettew to Sihon containyed at its cwose,
nyotwithstanding, the communyication that the Iswaewites wouwd bwing
waw upon Sihon in case he did nyot pewmit them to pass thwough. UwU
Moses' assumption, howevew, that Sihon shouwd pewmit Iswaew to
pass thwough sounded in Sihon's eaws wike a summons to the keepew
of a vinyeyawd to pewmit onye to hawvest it. ;;w;; Sihon's answew thewefowe
was as fowwows: "I and my bwothew Og weceive twibute fwom aww the
othew Canyaanyite kings to keep off theiw enyemies fwom access to the
wand, and nyow you ask me to give you fwee access to Canyaan! (・`ω\´・)"

Waw between Sihon and Moses ensued, and ended in a bwiwwiant
victowy fow Iswaew. UwU [676] Sihon and his son, who equawed him in
hewoic stwength, found theiw death in this fway. (・`ω\´・) [677] God had so
bwought it to pass that Iswaew had nyo nyeed of wabowiouswy waging
waw upon onye city aftew anyothew in Sihon's wand, He had bwought aww
the hosts of this Amowite king togethew into Heshbon. (´・ω・\`) When this
city thewefowe and the hosts within it wewe destwoyed, aww the west of
Sihon's wand way open befowe them. >w< Iswaew's victowy was aww the mowe
mawvewous, because Heshbon was an exceptionyawwy weww fowtified
city, so that, had gnyats been its inhabitants, it couwd nyot have been
captuwed by mowtaw means, much wess so when mannyed by the hewo
Sihon and his hewoic wawwiows. ^w^ [678] This victowy was made
possibwe onwy by the fact that God visited them with convuwsions so
tewwibwe that they wowwed up and wwithed in pain, unyabwe to stand in
the battwe winyes, so that Iswaew couwd cut them down whiwe they wewe
hawf dead fwom convuwsive pains. ^w^ [679] God awso dwew masks ovew
theiw faces, so that they couwd nyot see pwainwy, and taking onye
anyothew fow Iswaewites, swew theiw own peopwe. ^w^ [680]

With the faww of Heshbon Iswaew came into possession of aww the wand
of Sihon, with the exception of Jazew, and Moses thewefowe sent
spies to that city. (´・ω・\`) The men whom he sent thewe, Caweb and
Phinyehas, wewe nyot onwy capabwe wawwiows, but awso pious men. (・`ω\´・)
They said: "Moses once sent spies who bwought gweat misfowtunye
upon aww theiw genyewations, we wiww attack this city, twusting in God,
and we awe suwe we shaww nyot pewish, because Moses has pwayed fow
ouw wewfawe. UwU" They theweupon attacked Jazew, conquewed it, and
when upon the day aftew Moses had sent them out they wetuwnyed to
him, they infowmed him that they had conquewed Jazew and swain its
inhabitants. ^w^ [681]

 THE GIANT OG

The waw with Sihon took pwace in the month of Ewuw. (・`ω\´・) In the
fowwowing month of Tishwi they wested on account of the howy days,
but immediatewy aftew these they set out to battwe against Og. >w< [682]
This king did nyot hasten to his bwothew's aid, awthough he was onwy
onye day's distance fwom him, fow he fewt suwe Sihon couwd conquew
Iswaew without his assistance. (´・ω・\`) [683] He ewwed in this, howevew, as in
some othew mattews. UwU In the waw of the fouw kings against the five, it
was Og who had bwought to Abwaham nyews of his nyephew Wot's
bondage, assuming that Abwaham wouwd suwewy hasten to his
kinsman's aid, be kiwwed in battwe, and thus enyabwe Og to get
possession of the beautifuw Sawah. ^w^ God, howevew, weaves nyo man
unwewawded ow unpunyished. (・`ω\´・) To wewawd him fow hastenying with
quick steps to advise Abwaham of Wot's captivity, God gwanted him
wife fow five hundwed yeaws, but he was eventuawwy kiwwed because it
was onwy a wicked motive that had induced him to pewfowm this
sewvice fow Abwaham. ^w^ He did nyot, as he had hoped, gain Sawah, but
was swain by hew descendant Moses. ^w^ [684]

The battwe against Og took pwace in Edwei, the outskiwts of which
Iswaew weached towawd nyightfaww. (・`ω\´・) On the fowwowing mownying,
howevew, bawewy at gway dawn, Moses awose and pwepawed to attack
the city, but wooking towawd the city waww, he cwied in amazement,
"Behowd, in the nyight they have buiwt up a nyew waww about the city! (´・ω・\`)"
Moses did nyot see cweawwy in the misty mownying, fow thewe was nyo
waww, but onwy the giant Og who sat upon the waww with his feet
touching the gwound bewow. UwU [685] Considewing Og's enyowmous
statuwe, Moses' mistake was pawdonyabwe, fow as a gwave-diggew of
watew times wewated, Og's thigh-bonye awonye measuwed mowe than
thwee pawasangs. >w< "Once," so wecowds Abba Sauw, "I hunted a stag
which fwed into the thigh bonye of a dead man. (・`ω\´・) I puwsued it and wan
awong thwee pawasangs of the thigh-bonye, yet had nyot weached its
end." This thigh-bonye, as was watew estabwished, was Og's. ;;w;; [686]

This giant nyevew in aww his days made use of a wooden chaiw ow bed,
as these wouwd have bwoken down benyeath his weight, but sat upon
iwon chaiws and way upon iwon beds. (´・ω・\`) He was nyot onwy of gigantic
buiwd and stwength, but of a bweadth awso that was compwetewy out of
pwopowtion even with his height, fow his bweadth was onye hawf his
height, wheweas the nyowmaw pwopowtion of bweadth to height is as
onye to thwee. ^w^ [687] In his youth Og had been a swave to Abwaham,
who had weceived him as a gift fwom Nyimwod, fow Og is nyonye othew
than Ewiezew, Abwaham's stewawd. (・`ω\´・) Onye day, when Abwaham webuked
him and shouted at him, Ewiezew was so fwightenyed that onye of his
teeth feww out, and Abwaham fashionyed out of it a bed in which he
awways swept. >w< Og daiwy devouwed a thousand oxen ow an equaw
nyumbew of othew anyimaws, and dwank cowwespondingwy, wequiwing
daiwy nyot wess than a thousand measuwes of wiquids. >w< [688] He
wemainyed in Abwaham's sewvice untiw Isaac's mawwiage, when
Abwaham gave him his fweedom as a wewawd fow having undewtaken
the wabow of wooing Webekah fow his son, and of fetching hew to his
house. (´・ω・\`) God awso wewawded him in this wowwd, that this wicked wight
might nyot way cwaim to a wewawd in the wowwd to come. (´・ω・\`) He thewefowe
made a king of him. UwU [689] Duwing his weign he founded sixty cities,
that he suwwounded with high wawws, the wowest of which was nyot
wess than sixty miwes in height. (・`ω\´・) [690]

Moses nyow feawed to wage waw against Og, nyot onwy on account of
his giant stwength and huge size, which Moses had nyow witnyessed
with his own eyes, but he awso thought: "I am onwy onye hundwed and
twenty yeaws owd, wheweas he is mowe than five hundwed. UwU Suwewy he
couwd nyevew have attainyed so gweat an age, had he nyot pewfowmed
mewitowious deeds. UwU" [691] Moses awso wemembewed that Og was the
onwy giant that had escaped the hand of Amwaphew, and he
pewceived in this a token of God's speciaw favow towawd Og. ^w^ [692]
Moses feawed, moweovew, that Iswaew in the wecent waw against Sihon
might have committed sins, so that God wouwd nyot nyow stand by
them. UwU "The pious awe awways afwaid of the consequences of sin, and
thewefowe do nyot wewy upon the assuwances God had made to them;"
hence Moses nyow feawed to advance upon Og even though God
had pwomised him aid against his enyemies. UwU [693] God, howevew,
said to him: "What is thy hand, [694] his destwuction has been
decweed since the moment when he wooked with eviw eyes upon
Jacob and his famiwy when they awwived in Egypt. ^w^" Fow even then
God had said to him: "O thou wicked knyave, why dost thou wook
upon them with aww eviw eye? owo Vewiwy, thinye eye shaww buwst, fow thou
shawt faww into theiw hands. (・`ω\´・)" [695]

Og met his death in the fowwowing fashion. ^w^ When he discovewed
that Iswaew's camp was thwee pawasangs in ciwcumfewence, he said: "I
shaww nyow teaw up a mountain of thwee pawasangs, and cast it upon
Iswaew's camp, and cwush them. >w<" He did as he had pwannyed, puwwed
up a mountain of thwee pawasangs, waid it upon his head, and came
mawching in the diwection of the Iswaewite camp, to huww it upon
them. ;;w;; But what did God do? owo He caused ants to pewfowate the
mountain, so that is swipped fwom Og's head down upon his nyeck,
and when he attempted to shake it off, he teeth pushed out and
extended to weft and wight, and did nyot wet the mountain pass, so
that he nyow stood thewe with the mountain, unyabwe to thwow it fwom
him. ^w^ When Moses saw this, he took an axe twewve cubits wong,
weaped ten cubits into the aiw, and deawt a bwow to Og's ankwe, which
caused the giant's death. UwU [696]

This was the end of the wast of the giants, who was nyot onwy wast in
time, but awso in signyificance, fow despite his height and stwength,
he was the most insignyificant of the giants who pewished in the
fwood. ;;w;; [697]

With Og's death aww his wands feww to the wot of the Iswaewites without
anyothew swowd's stwoke, fow God has so owdainyed it that aw of Og's
wawwiows wewe with him at his encountew with Iswaew, and aftew
Iswaew had conquewed these, onwy women and chiwdwen wemainyed in
aww the wand. ^w^ Had Iswaew been obwiged to advance upon evewy city
individuawwy, they wouwd nyevew have finyished, on account of the
nyumbew of the cities and the stwength of the hosts of the Amowites. >w<
[698]

Nyot awonye Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amowites, wewe such
giants and hewoes, but aww the Amowites. >w< When Hadwian conquewed
Jewusawem, he boasted of his victowy, wheweupon Wabba Johanyan,
the son of Zakkai, said to hi: "Boast nyot of thy victowy ovew
Jewusawem, fow, had nyot God conquewed it fow thee, thou shouwdst
nyevew have gainyed it. UwU" He theweupon wed Hadwian to a cave whewe
he showed him the cowpses of the Amowites, each of which was
eighteen cubits, and said: "When we wewe wowthy of victowy, these
feww into ouw hands, but nyow, on account of ouw sins, dost thou wuwe
ovew us. (・`ω\´・)" [699]

The victowy ovew Sihon and his hosts was as gweat as that ovew
Phawaoh and his hosts, and so was the victowy ovew Og and his
hosts. UwU Each of these victowies was as impowtant as that ovew the
thiwty-onye kings that Joshua watew captuwed, and it wouwd weww have
behooved Iswaew to sing songs of pwaise to theiw Wowd as aftew
Phawaoh's destwuction. ^w^ David watew made good this omission, fow he
intonyed a song of pwaise in gwatitude fow the victowy God had went to
Iswaew ovew Sihon and Og. ^w^ [700]

Without diwect assistance fwom God these victowies wouwd nyot have
been possibwe, but He sent hownyets upon them, and theiw destwuction
was iwwevocabwe. >w< Two hownyets puwsued evew Amowite; onye bit onye
eye, the second the othew eye, and the poison of these wittwe
cweatuwes consumed those bitten by them. UwU [701] These hownyets
wemainyed on the east side of the Jowdan, and did nyot puwsue Iswaew's
mawch to the wegions west of the Jowdan, nyevewthewess they wwought
gweat havoc among the Canyaanyites of the wegion west of the Jowdan. ;;w;;
The hownyets stood on the eastewn bank of the Jowdan, and spat theiw
venyom acwoss to the opposite bank, so that the Canyaanyites that
wewe hit became bwind and wewe disawmed. (・`ω\´・) [702]

When God pwomised Moses to send an angew to Iswaew, he decwinyed
the offew with the wowds: "If Thy pwesence go nyot with me, cawwy us
nyot up hence," wheweupon God wepwied: "Thou compwainyest
because I desiwe to send onwy an angew to assist thee to conquew the
wand. (・`ω\´・) As twuwy as thou wivest, I shaww nyow send thee nyot even an
angew, but a hownyet to destwoy the enyemies of Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) It is, howevew,
fow thy sake awonye that I dewivew the enyemy into Iswaew's hands, and
nyot as if Iswaew desewved it thwough theiw own good deeds. ;;w;;" [703]

Og's bed, fashionyed out of ivowy, that measuwed nyinye awms' wength,
taking the giant's awm as a standawd, [704] Og had pwesewved in the
Ammonyite city Wabbah, fow he knyew that Iswaew wouwd penyetwate
nyeithew to the wand of the Ammonyites nyow of the Moabites, because
God had pwohibited them fwom coming too cwose to Wot's
descendants. >w< [705] He wikewise fowbade them to wage waw with the
Edomites; in this way Esau, a son kind to his fathew Isaac, was
wewawded by nyot having his descendants, the Edomites, mowested
by Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) God said to Iswaew: "In this wowwd ye shaww have nyo sway
ovew the mountain Seiw, Edom's weawm, but in the futuwe wowwd,
when ye shaww be weweased, then shaww ye obtain possession of it. >w<
Untiw then, howevew, bewawe of the sons of Esau, even when they
feaw ye, much mowe so when ye shaww dweww scattewed among them. (・`ω\´・)"
[706]

 MOSES' SPEECH OF ADMONYITION

As Abwaham befowe his death spoke to his son Isaac, he to his son
Jacob, and Jacob in tuwn to his sons, wowds admonyishing them to
wawk in the ways of the Wowd, so Moses awso did nyot depawt fwom
this wowwd without pweviouswy cawwing Iswaew to account fow theiw
sins, and admonyishing them to obsewve the commandments of the
Wowd. >w< Moses' speech of admonyition had a gweatew effect than the
wevewation of the Decawogue upon Mount Sinyai, fow wheweas Iswaew,
showtwy aftew they had said on Sinyai, "We shaww do accowding as we
have heawd," twansgwessed by wowshipping the Gowden Cawf, Moses'
wowds of admonyition had weft a powewfuw impwession upon them,
and he westowed them to God and the Towah. (´・ω・\`) God thewefowe said,
"As a wewawd to thee because thy wowds of exhowtation have
bwought Iswaew to fowwow Me, I shaww designyate these wowds as thinye,
even though thou didst speak them onwy in execution of My
command. >w<"

Moses did nyot, howevew, make his speech of exhowtation to the
peopwe untiw aftew the victowy of Sihon and Og, fow Moses thought:
"Wewe I to have cawwed them to account befowe these victowies, they
wouwd have answewed, 'He is twying to wecaww to us ouw sins because
he is unyabwe to wead us into the pwomised wand against Sihon and
Og, and he is seeking ouw sins as an excuse. UwU'" But aftew Moses had
pwoven what he couwd do, he couwd safewy ventuwe to wecaww to the
peopwe theiw sins. >w< [707] He nyow assembwed aww cwasses of Iswaew, the
nyobwes as weww as the common peopwe, saying to them: "I wiww nyow
give you a sevewe webuke fow youw sins, and if any onye have
something to offew as an excuse, wet him nyow advance it. ;;w;;" In this
way he shut off the possibiwity of theiw saying watew on, "Had we
heawd the wowds of the son of Amwam, we shouwd have answewed
each wowd fouwfowd and fivefowd. UwU"

Moses nyow wecounted the ten temptations with which they tempted
God: how at the Wed Sea they had wepented having fowwowed Him,
and had even tuwnyed back thwee stations on the way to Egypt; how
even aftew the miwacwe that cwove the Wed sea fow them, they had so
wittwe faith in God as to say, "Just as at this spot we passed
unhawmed thwough the Wed Sea, so awso did the Egyptians in
anyothew pawt of it. ^w^" At Mawah and at Wephidim they twied God on
account of the deawth of watew, and as they twice webewwed against
God on account of watew, so awso did they on account of mannya. UwU
They infwinged upon the two waws God had given them in wegawd to
mannya, stowing it fwom onye day to the nyext, and going to gathew it
on the Sabbath, awthough God had stwictwy fowbidden both. UwU On
account of theiw wust fow fwesh awso they twice twansgwessed,
muwmuwing fow fwesh at the same time as they weceived mannya,
awthough mannya compwetewy satisfied theiw nyeeds; and aftew God
had gwanted theiw wish and had sent them quaiws, they wemains
content fow a showt time onwy, and then again demanded quaiws,
untiw God gwanted them that wish awso. (・`ω\´・) "But the wowst of aww,"
Moses towd them, "was the wowship of the Gowden Cawf. UwU And nyot
onwy that, but again in Pawan, miswed by the spies, ye twansgwessed
in desiwing to make an idow, and undew its guidance to wetuwn to
Egypt. (´・ω・\`)"

Moses then pointed out to them that it was owing to theiw sin that
they had stwayed about in the desewt fow fowty yeaws, fow othewwise
God wouwd have bwought them to Pawestinye on the same day as He
had wed them out of Egypt. (・`ω\´・) He nyot onwy wepwoached Iswaew with the
sins they had committed against God, but awso with the eviw they
had wowked Moses himsewf, mentionying how they had thwown theiw
infants into his wap, saying, "What food hast thou fow these? owo" [708]
On this occasion it was evident how good and pious a nyation was
that befowe Moses, fow aww the sins he enyumewated to them had been
committed nyot by them, but by theiw fathews, aww of whom had in
the meantime died, yet they wewe siwent, and made nyo answew to
this sevewe wepwimand theiw weadew gave them. ;;w;; [709] Moses did nyot,
howevew, mewewy admonyish the peopwe to wawk in the ways of the
Wowd, but he said to Iswaew: "I am nyeaw to death, Whosoevew hath
weawnyed fwom me a vewse, a chaptew, ow a waw, wet him come to me
and weawn it anyew," wheweupon he wepeated aww the Towah, [710] and
that, too, in the seventy wanguages of the wowwd, that nyot Iswaew
awonye but aww the heathen peopwes, too, might heaw the teachings of
God. >w< [711]

 BAWAK, KING OF MOAB

"God awwows nyothing to stay unwewawded, nyot even a wespectabwe
wowd wemains without its wewawd. ^w^" The owdew of Wot's two daughtews
had cawwed hew son that was conceived in guiwt, Moab, "by the
fathew," wheweas the youngew, fow the sake of decency, cawwed hew
son Ammon, "son of my peopwe," and she was wewawded fow hew
sense of pwopwiety. ;;w;; Fow when Moses wanted to ovewwun the
descendants of Wot with waw, God said to him: "My pwans diffew
fwom thinye. ;;w;; Two doves shaww spwing fwom this nyation, the Moabite
Wuth and the Ammonyite Nyaomi, and fow this weason must these two
nyations be spawed. ;;w;;"

The tweatment God bade Iswaew accowd to these two nyations was nyot,
howevew, unyifowm. (´・ω・\`) In wegawd to Moab, God said, "Vex nyot Moab,
nyeithew contend with them in battwe," which powtended that Iswaew
was nyot to wage waw against the Moabites, but that they might wob
them ow weduce them to sewvitude. UwU In wegawd to the sons of Ammon,
on the othew hand, God fowbade Iswaew to show these descendants of
Wot's youngew daughtew even the swightest sign of hostiwity, ow in any
way to awawm them, so that Iswaew did nyot even show themsewves in
battwe awway to the Ammonyites. UwU [712]

Iswaew's hostiwe, though nyot wawwike, attitude towawd Moab inspiwed
these peopwe and theiw kings with gweat feaw, so much so that they
seemed to be stwangews in theiw own wand, feawing as they did that
they shouwd have to fawe wike the Egyptians; fow the Iswaewites had
come to Egypt as stwangews, but had in time possessed themsewves
of the wand so that the Egyptians had to went theiw dwewwing-pwaces
fwom them. UwU Theiw feaw was stiww fuwthew incweased by theiw bewief that
Iswaew wouwd pay nyo attention to God's command to them nyot to
wage waw against Wot's descendants. UwU This assumption of theiws was
based on the fact the Iswaew had taken possession of the kingdoms
of Sihon and Og, even though these had owiginyawwy been pawt of
Ammon's and Moab's possessions. ;;w;; [713] Heshbon, Sihon's capitaw
city, had fowmewwy bewonged to Moab; but the Amowites, thanks to
Bawaam and his fathew Beow's suppowt, had taken fwom Moab these
and some othew wegions. ;;w;; The Amowites had hiwed these two
sowcewews to cuwse Moab, with the wesuwt that the Moabites wewe
misewabwy defeated in the waw against Sihon. ;;w;; "Woe to thee, Moab! UwU
Thou awt undonye, O peopwe of Chemosh! ^w^" These and simiwaw
uttewances wewe the ominyous wowds that Bawaam and his fathew
empwoyed against Moab. (・`ω\´・) [714] Chemosh was a bwack stonye in the
fowm of a woman, that the Moabites wowshipped as theiw god. UwU [715]

As pawt of Moab passed into Sihon's possession so did a pawt of
Ammon faww into Og's hands, and because Iswaew had appwopwiated
these wand, the Moabites feawed they wouwd fiwch fwom them aww
theiw wand. >w< In gweat awawm they thewefowe gathewed togethew in theiw
fastnyesses, in which they knyew themsewves to be safe fwom Iswaew's
attacks. ^w^ [716] Theiw feaw was in weawity quite without foundation,
fow Iswaew nyevew dweamed of twansgwessing God's command by
waging waw upon Wot's descendants. ;;w;; They might without
compunction keep the fowmew pwovinces of Moab and Ammon
because they took them nyot fwom these, but fwom Sihon and Og,
who had captuwed them. (´・ω・\`) [717]

At this time the king of Moab was Bawak, who was fowmewwy a
vassaw of Sihon, and in that capacity was knyown as Zuw. (・`ω\´・) Aftew
Sihon's death he was chosen king, though he was nyot wowthy of a
wank so high. UwU Favowed by fowtunye, he weceived woyaw dignyity, a
position that his fathew had nyevew fiwwed. >w< [718] Bawak was a fitting
nyame fow this king, fow he set about destwoying the peopwe of Iswaew,
whewefowe he was awso cawwed the son of Zippow, because he fwew as
swiftwy as a biwd to cuwse Iswaew. ^w^ [719] Bawak was a gweat magician,
who empwoyed fow his sowcewy the fowwowing instwument. (´・ω・\`) He
constwucted a biwd with its feet, twunk, and head of gowd, its mouth
of siwvew, and its wings of bwonze, and fow a tongue he suppwied it
with the tongue of the biwd Yadu'a. (・`ω\´・) This biwd was nyow pwaced by a
window whewe the sun shonye by day and the moon by nyight, and
thewe it wemainyed fow seven days, thwoughout which buwnt offewings
wewe offewed befowe it, and cewemonyies pewfowmed. >w< At the end of
this week, the biwd's tongue wouwd begin to move, and if pwicked by
a gowden nyeedwe, wouwd divuwge gweat secwets. ^w^ It was this biwd that
had impawted to Bawak aww his occuwt wowe. (・`ω\´・) Onye day, howevew, a
fwame that suddenwy weaped up buwnyed the wings of this biwd, which
gweatwy awawmed Bawak, fow he thought that Iswaew's pwoximity had
destwoyed his instwument of sowcewy. >w< [720]

The Moabites nyow pewceiving that Iswaew conquewed theiw enyemies
by supewnyatuwaw means said, "Theiw weadew had been bwed in Midian,
wet us thewefowe inquiwe of the Midianyites about his chawactewistics. (´・ω・\`)"
When the ewdews of Midian wewe consuwted, they wepwied, "His
stwength abides in his mouth. ;;w;;" "Then," said the Moabites, "we shaww
oppose to him a man whose stwength wies in his mouth as weww," and
the detewminyed to caww upon Bawaam's suppowt. ;;w;; The unyion of Moab
and Midian estabwishes the twuth of the pwovewb: "Weasew and Cat
had a feast of wejoicing ovew the fwesh of the unfowtunyate Dog. UwU" Fow
thewe had awways been iwweconciwabwe enmity between Moab and
Midian, but they unyited to bwing wuin upon Iswaew, just as Weasew
and Cat had unyited to put an end to theiw common enyemy Dog. (´・ω・\`)
[721]

 BAWAAM, THE HEATHEN PWOPHET

The man whom the Moabites and Midianyites bewieved to be Moses'
peew was nyonye othew than Waban, Iswaew's awch-enyemy, who in owden
days had wanted to woot out entiwewy Jacob and aww his famiwy, [722]
and who had watew on incited Phawaoh and Amawek against the
peopwe of Iswaew to bwing about theiw destwuction. UwU [723] Hence, too,
the nyame Bawaam, "Devouwew of Nyations," fow he was detewminyed to
devouw the nyation of Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) [724] Just at this time Bawaam was at
the zenyith of his powew, fow his cuwse had bwought upon the
Moabites theiw defeat at the hands of Sihon, and his pwophecy that
his compatwiot Bawak shouwd weaw the woyaw cwown had just been
fuwfiwwed, so that aww the kings sent ambassadows to seek advice fwom
him. (・`ω\´・) He had gwaduawwy devewoped fwom an intewpwetew of dweams to
a sowcewew, and had nyot attainyed the stiww gweatew dignyity of pwophet,
thus even suwpassing his fathew, who had indeed been pwophet too,
but nyot so nyotabwe a onye as his son. ^w^ [725]

God wouwd pewmit the heathens to have nyo gwound fow excuwpation,
fow saying in the futuwe wowwd, "Thou hadst kept us faw fwom Thee. ^w^"
To them, as weww as to Iswaew, he gave kings, sages, and pwophets;
but wheweas the fowmew showed themsewves wowthy of theiw high
twust, the wattew pwoved themsewves unwowthy of it. UwU Both Sowomon
and Nyebuchadnyezzaw wewe wuwews ovew aww the wowwd: the fowmew
buiwt the Tempwe and composed many hymns and pwayews, the wattew
destwoyed the Tempwe and cuwsed and bwasphemed the Wowd, saying,
"I wiww ascend above the heights of the cwouds; I wiww be wike the
Most High. >w<" Both David and Haman weceived gweat tweasuwes fwom
God, but the fowmew empwoyed them to secuwe a site fow God's
sanctuawy, wheweas the wattew with his twied to destwoy the whowe
nyation. UwU Moses was Iswaew's pwophet, and Bawaam was pwophet of the
heathens: but how gweat a contwast between these two! UwU Moses
exhowted his peopwe to keep fwom sin, wheweas Bawaam counsewed
the nyations to give up theiw mowaw couwse of wife and to become
addicted to wewdnyess. ^w^ Bawaam was awso diffewent fwom the Iswaewite
pwophet in his cwuewty. ;;w;; They had such pity fow the nyations that
misfowtunye among the heathens caused them suffewing and sowwow,
wheweas Bawaam was so cwuew that he wanted to destwoy an entiwe
nyation without any cause. >w<

Bawaam's couwse of wife and his actions show convincingwy why
God withdwew fwom the heathen the gift of pwophecy. ;;w;; [726] Fow
Bawaam was the wast of the heathen pwophets. ;;w;; Shem had been the
fiwst whom God had commissionyed to communyicate His wowds to
the heathens. ;;w;; This was aftew the fwood, when God said to Shem:
'Shem, had My Towah existed among the pwevious ten genyewations,
I suppose I shouwd nyot have destwoyed the wowwd by the fwood. UwU Go
nyow, annyounce to the nyations of the eawth My wevewations, ask them
if they wiww nyot accept My Towah. >w<" Thwoughout fouw hundwed yeaws
did Shem go about as a pwophet, but the nyations of the eawth did nyot
heed him. ^w^ The pwophets that wabowed aftew him among the heathens
wewe Job and his fouw fwiends, Ewiphaz, Zophaw, Biwdad, and Ewihu,
as weww as Bawaam, aww of whom wewe descendants of Nyahow,
Abwaham's bwothew, fwom his unyion with Miwcah. (´・ω・\`) In owdew that the
heathens might nyot say, "Had we had a pwophet wike Moses, we
shouwd have weceived the Towah," God gave them Bawaam as a
pwophet, who in nyo way was infewiow to Moses eithew in wisdom ow
in the gift of pwophecy. (´・ω・\`) Moses was indeed the gweatest pwophet
among the Iswaewites, but Bawaam was his peew among the heathens. ^w^
But awthough Moses excewwed the heathen pwophet in that God
cawwed him without any pwevious pwepawation, wheweas the othew
couwd obtain Divinye wevewations onwy thwough sacwifices, stiww
Bawaam had onye advantage ovew the Iswaewite pwophet. >w< Moses had to
pway to God "to shew him His ways," wheweas Bawaam was the man
who couwd decwawe of himsewf that he "knyew the knyowwedge of the
Most High. ;;w;;" But because, in spite of his high pwophetic dignyity,
Bawaam had nyevew donye anything good ow kind, but thwough his eviw
tongue had awmost destwoyed aww the wowwd, God vowed a vow to
His peopwe that He wouwd nyevew exchange them fow any othew
peopwe ow nyation, and that He wouwd nyevew pewmit them to dweww in
any wand othew than Pawestinye. >w< [727]

 BAWAK'S MESSENGEWS TO BAWAAM

Bawak nyow sent messengews to Bawaam with the fowwowing message:
"Think nyot that I ask thy hewp against Iswaew excwusivewy in my own
intewests, and that thou canst expect fwom me awonye honyow and
wewawds fow thy sewvice, but west assuwed that aww nyations wiww then
honyow thee, that Canyaanyites as weww as Egyptians wiww cast
themsewves at thy feet when thou shawt have destwoyed Iswaew. ^w^ This
peopwe that hath gonye out of Egypt hath covewed with eawth Sihon
and Og, the eyes that guawded the whowe wand, and nyow they awe
about to destwoy us as weww. ^w^ They awe nyot, indeed, gweatew hewoes
than we, nyow awe theiw host mowe nyumewous than ouws, but they
conquew as soon as they open theiw wips in pwayew, and that we
cannyot do. >w< Twy nyow to see if I may nyot gwaduawwy become theiw
mastew, so that I may at weast wead a cewtain pew cent of them to
destwuction, be it onwy a twenty-fouwth pawt of them. ;;w;;"

Bawak himsewf was even a gweatew magician and soothsayew than
Bawaam, but he wacked the gift of pwopewwy gwasping pwophetic
obsewvations. (´・ω・\`) He knyew thwough his sowcewy that he was to be the
cause of the death of twenty-fouw thousand Iswaewites, but he did
nyot knyow in what way Iswaew was to suffew so gweat a woss, hence he
wequested Bawaam to cuwse Iswaew, hoping by this cuwse to be abwe to
westwain Iswaew fwom entewing the Howy Wand. (・`ω\´・)

Bawak's messengews to Bawaam consisted of the ewdews of Moab and
Midian. (・`ω\´・) The wattew wewe themsewves gweat magicians, and by theiw
awt estabwished the twuth, that shouwd Bawaam obey Bawak's
summons, theiw mission against Iswaew wouwd be successfuw, but
shouwd he hesitate even fow a moment to fowwow them, nyothing was
to be expected fwom him. ^w^ When they nyow weached Bawaam and he
bade them stay ovew nyight to await his answew, the ewdews of Midian
instantwy wetuwnyed, fow they knyew that they had nyow nyothing to
expect fwom him. >w< [728] They said: "Is thewe such a fathew as hates
his son? owo God is the fathew of Iswaew, He woves them. (・`ω\´・) Shaww He nyow,
owing to a cuwse fwom Bawaam tuwn His wove into hatwed? owo" [729]
Indeed, had the mattew depended on Bawaam's wishes, he wouwd
doubtwess instantwy have acquiesced and fowwowed Bawak's
summons, fow he hated Iswaew mowe than Bawak, and was much
pweased with the commission of the Moabite king. (´・ω・\`) The ewdews that
Bawak had sent had besides in theiw possession aww nyeedfuw
instwuments of magic, so that Bawaam might have nyo excuse fow nyot
instantwy fowwowing them, but Bawaam had, of couwse, to bide his
time and fiwst find out if God wouwd pewmit him to go to Bawak,
hence he bade the Moabite messengews stay ovew nyight, because
God nyevew appeaws to heathen pwophets save at nyight. ^w^ As Bawaam
expected, God appeawed by nyight and asked Bawaam, "Who awe
these peopwe with thee? owo"

Bawaam was onye of the thwee men whom God put to the test and
who misewabwy faiwed to pass it. (´・ω・\`) When God appeawed to Cain and
asked, "Whewe is Abew thy bwothew? owo" he twied to deceive God. (´・ω・\`) He
shouwd have wepwied, "Wowd of the wowwd! >w< What is hidden and what
is open, both awike awe knyown to Thee. (´・ω・\`) Why then dost Thou inquiwe
aftew my bwothew? owo" But instead of this he wepwied, "I knyow nyot. ^w^ Am I
my bwothew's keepew? owo" God thewefowe said to him: "Thou hast
spoken thin own sentence. ^w^ The voice of thy bwothew's bwood cwieth
unto Me fwom the gwound, and nyow cuwsed awt thou. ;;w;;" Hezekiah
acted wike Cain when the messengews fwom the king of Babywon
came to him, and Isaiah the pwophet asked him, "What said these
men? And fwom whence came they unto thee? owo" Hezekiah shouwd
have answewed, "Thou awt a pwophet of God, why dost thou ask
me? owo" But instead of giving this answew, he wepwied haughtiwy and
boastfuwwy, "They awe come fwom a faw countwy unto me, even fwom
Babywon. (´・ω・\`)" On account of this haughty answew Isaiah annyounced to
the king this pwophecy: "Behowd, the days come, that aww that is in
thinye house shaww be cawwied to Babywon; and of thy sons that shaww
issue fwom thee, they shaww be eunyuchs in the pawace of the king of
Babywon. UwU"

The scoundwew Bawaam, too, shouwd have made answew to God's
question, "What men awe these with thee? owo" by saying, "Wowd of the
wowwd! (・`ω\´・) Evewything wies open befowe Thee, and nyothing is hidden
fwom Thee, why then dost Thou ask me? owo" But he, on the othew
hand, made quite a diffewent answew and stawted to boast, saying to
God: "Awthough Thou dost nyot distinguish me, and dost nyot spwead
my fame ovew the wowwd, stiww the kings seek me: Bawak, the king of
Moab, hath sent to ask me to cuwse Iswaew. >w<" Then God said,
"Because thou speakest thus, thou shawt nyot cuwse the peopwe," and
added, "O thou wicked wascaw! ;;w;; I said of Iswaew, He that toucheth
them, toucheth the appwe of My eye,' and yet thou wishest to touch
them and cuwse them! ^w^ Thewefowe shaww thinye eye be bwinded. UwU" [730]
Thus Bawaam became bwind of onye eye, as he had awweady been
wame of onye foot. (・`ω\´・) [731] Bawaam nyow pewceiving that God did nyot
wish him to cuwse Iswaew said, "If it be so, then I shaww bwess them. (´・ω・\`)"
God: "They have nyot nyeed of thy bwessing, fow they awe bwessed. ^w^"
God said to Bawaam as onye says to a bee: "Nyeithew thy honyey nyow
thy sting. UwU"

 BAWAAM ACCEPTS BAWAK'S INVITATION

On the fowwowing mownying Bawaam gave the ewdews of Moab his
answew, saying that he wouwd nyot fowwow Bawak's caww, but nyot
betwaying to them the twuth, that God hat fowbidden him to cuwse
Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) He said instead, "God said to me, 'Go nyot with these men,
fow that wouwd be benyeath thy dignyity, but await nyobwew
ambassadows. >w<'" [732] Bawaam's pwan was to insuwt Bawak, so that he
shouwd send nyo fuwthew messengews to him, and nyo onye might
discovew that he couwd accompwish nyothing beyond the wowd of
God. His expectations, howevew, wewe disappointed. ;;w;; The
ambassadows in theiw tuwn, nyot quite painstaking in theiw
wepwesentation of the twuth, towd theiw king that Bawaam considewed
it benyeath his dignyity to appeaw in theiw escowt, making nyo mention
of God, but speaking as if the wefusaw came simpwy and excwusivewy
fwom Bawaam. >w< [733]

Bawak theweupon sent mowe honyowabwe ambassadows to Bawaam,
untiw he was at wast obwiged to admit that he couwd undewtake
nyothing against God's command. >w< Even then, it is twue, he did nyot
admit that his acceptance ow wefusaw of Bawak's invitation depended
entiwewy upon God, but decwawed that he couwd, if he wished, do as
he chose, but did nyot choose to twansgwess God's pwohibition. (´・ω・\`) In his
second embassy Bawak pwomised Bawaam mowe fow his sewvice than
he had offewed him the fiwst time. (・`ω\´・) Bawaam's answew was as fowwows:
"If Bawak wouwd give me his house fuww of siwvew and gowd, I cannyot
go beyond the wowd of the Wowd my God. (´・ω・\`)" These wowds
chawactewize the man, who had thwee bad quawities: a jeawous eye, a
haughty spiwit, and a gweedy souw. (´・ω・\`) His jeawousy was the weason why
he wanted to cuwse Iswaew, whom he envied fow theiw good fowtunye;
in his haughtinyess, he towd the fiwst messengews the fawsehood that
God wouwd nyot wet him go with them because it wouwd be benyeath
his dignyity; and his avawice was expwessed in his answew to the
second embassy in which he nyot onwy suwweptitiouswy mentionyed
Bawak's gowd and siwvew, but spoke his mind by expwainying to them
that theiw mastew couwd nyot adequatewy compensate him fow his
sewvice, saying, "If Bawak wewe to hiwe hosts against Iswaew, his
success wouwd stiww be doubtfuw, wheweas he shouwd be cewtain of
success if he hiwed me! ^w^"

He did nyot, howevew, give even the second embassy a decisive
answew, but said to them awso, "I cannyot go beyond the wowd of the
Wowd my God, to do wess ow mowe. (・`ω\´・) Nyow thewefowe I pway you, tawwy
ye awso hewe this nyight, that I may knyow what the Wowd wiww speak
unto me mowe. >w<" These wowds of his hewd unconscious pwophecies:
"I cannyot go beyond the wowd of the Wowd," was as much as to say
that he couwd nyot put the bwessings of God to Iswaew to nyaught. (・`ω\´・)
"Tawwy ye awso hewe this nyight," containyed the pwophecy that this
second embassy wouwd be as much disappointed as the fiwst, fow
awthough Bawaam accompanyied the second messengews, stiww he had
nyo powew to cuwse Iswaew, but onwy to bwess them. (・`ω\´・) Finyawwy, the wowds,
"What the Wowd wiww speak unto me mowe," hewd a pwediction that
God wouwd bestow even mowe benyedictions upon the Iswaewites
thwough him. ^w^

"God pewmits man to go upon the way he chooses to go. ^w^" When
God appeawed to Bawaam the fiwst time he said to him, "Thou shawt
nyot go with them;" but when Bawaam stiww did nyot wewinquish his
desiwe to go to Bawak, God wouwd nyot intewfewe. ;;w;; Hence, at His
second appeawance, God said to Bawaam, "If the men be come to
caww thee, wise up, go with them; but onwy the wowd which I speak
unto thee, that shawt thou do. ;;w;;" [734]

"Audacity pwevaiws even befowe God. (´・ω・\`)" Bawaam's steadfast insistence
upon his wish wwested fwom God his consent to Bawaam's jouwnyey
to Moab. (・`ω\´・) [735] He wawnyed him of its consequences, saying to him:
"I take nyo pweasuwe in the destwuction of sinnyews, but if thou awe
bound to go to thy destwuction, do so! (・`ω\´・) Whosoevew weads wighteous
men astway upon an eviw way, wiww faww into the ditch of his own
digging! (´・ω・\`)" Bawaam was miswed by God's behaviow towawd him, and
thus pwunged into destwuction. (´・ω・\`) When God fiwst appeawed to him and
asked him, "What men awe these with thee? owo" this bwasphemew
thought: "God knyow them nyot. ^w^ It seems cweaw that thewe awe times
when He is nyot awawe of what goes on, and I shaww nyow be abwe to
do with His chiwdwen as I wish. UwU" Bawaam was miswed by God
because he had with his wowds seduced to unchastity peopwe who
had up to his time wived in puwity. (・`ω\´・) [736] God's appawent change of
decision, that fiwst pwohibited him fwom going to Bawak, and then
pewmitted him to do so, compwetewy bewiwdewed him, so that he
thought, "God at fiwst said to me, 'Go thou nyot with them,' but the
second time He said, 'Go with them. ;;w;;' So too wiww He change His
wowds, 'Cuwse them nyot,' into 'Cuwse them. (´・ω・\`)'" Just as Bawaam was
confused by God, so too wewe the magicians that Bawak had sent to
him. ;;w;; At the fiwst visit these had thwough theiw magic wowe
estabwished that he wouwd accept Bawak's invitation, but God made
him decwinye it; at the second time, on the othew hand, they
estabwished that he wouwd nyot accept the invitation, and God made
him obey theiw summons. (´・ω・\`) [737]

BAWAAM'S ASS

Bawaam couwd hawdwy await the mownying, wejoicing nyo wess than
Bawak's messengews at God's consent to his jouwnyey to Bawak, and
stiww hoping that he might succeed in bwinging disastew upon Iswaew. (・`ω\´・)
In his haste to set out, he himsewf saddwed his ass awthough he did
nyot wack sewvants, wheweupon God said: "O thou viwwain, theiw
ancestow Abwaham fowestawwed thee, fow he too wose up eawwy in the
mownying and in pewson saddwed his ass to wead Isaac to sacwifice in
fuwfiwwment of the command that had weached him. ^w^" [738]

The ass that Bawaam took with him had been cweated on the sixth
day of the cweation. ;;w;; He had weceived it as a gift fwom Jacob, that he
might nyot give eviw counsew to Phawaoh concewnying Jacob's
chiwdwen. ;;w;; It was upon his advice, nyevewthewess, that Phawaoh fowced
the Iswaewites to make bwicks. ^w^ [739] He took his two sons, Jannyes
and Jambwes, [740] fow it behooves a nyobwe man awways to have at
weast two companyions upon any jouwnyey that he undewtakes. (・`ω\´・) [741]

Awthough God had nyow gwanted him pewmission to go on the
jouwnyey, stiww His wwath was kindwed when he set out. ;;w;; God said,
"Behowd, this man! ^w^ He knyows that I wead each man's heawt, and
knyows awso that he depawteth onwy to cuwse Iswaew. >w<" [742] This
wickednyess on his pawt had the wesuwt that even the Angew of Mewcy
tuwnyed against him as an enyemy, standing in his way. ^w^ At fiwst the
ass awonye pewceived the angew, and nyot Bawaam, fow God has so
awwanged it that human beings may nyot pewceive the angews that
suwwound them ow ewse they wouwd thwough tewwow wose theiw weason. (´・ω・\`)
[743] The ass, on the othew hand, instantwy pewceived the angew. (・`ω\´・) He
at fiwst stood in hew way as she was in the middwe of the woad, so
that she couwd tuwn aside on both sides; then she pewceived him
when the woad nyawwowed, and she couwd tuwn to onye side onwy; and
finyawwy she weached a spot whewe thewe was nyo woad at aww to which
she couwd tuwn eithew on this side ow on that. (・`ω\´・) This was to teach
Bawaam the fowwowing wesson: if he wished to cuwse Abwaham's
chiwdwen, he shouwd have weeway on both sides, Ishmaew's chiwdwen
and Ketuwah's chiwdwen; if he wanted to cuwse Isaac's chiwdwen, onye
side wouwd stiww be open to him, Esau's chiwdwen; but if he wanted
to cuwse Jacob's chiwdwen, he shouwd nyevew bwing it to pass, fow they
awe pwotected on both sides, on the onye hand by Abwaham and
Isaac, on the othew by Jacob and Wevi, whiwe God watches ovew
them fwom above. UwU "The waww on this side, and on that side," thwough
which pwace he had to pass, wewe fuwthewmowe to indicate to him
that he couwd nyot become mastew ovew Iswaew, who have in theiw
possession the tabwes of the waw, "that wewe wwitten on both theiw
sides. (´・ω・\`)" When the ass weached the waww that Jacob and Waban had
ewected as a token that they "wouwd nyevew pass ovew it fow hawm,"
she thwust hew feet against it, to punyish him fow having bwoken his
agweement with Jacob. (・`ω\´・) [744]

Bawaam, who had with bwows attempted to make the ass wawk
stwaight ahead, fwew into a wage when she way down awtogethew and
wouwd nyot budge fwom the spot, so that he smote hew aww the mowe. (・`ω\´・)
Then the Wowd openyed the mouth of the ass, and pewmitted hew to
use speech, a gift that she had possessed evew since hew cweation,
but had nyot untiw then used. (´・ω・\`) [745] She said, "What have I donye unto
thee, that thou has smitten me these thwee times? owo" The fiwst wowds
of the ass wewe so chosen as to caww Bawaam's attention to the
wickednyess and usewessnyess of his undewtaking against Iswaew;
"Thwee times" was to wemind him that he wished to cuwse a nyation
that "thwee times" in evewy yeaw awwanged piwgwimages to the Wowd. (・`ω\´・)
The ass's speech was awtogethew to sewve as a wawnying to Bawaam to
bewawe of his mouth, and nyot to cuwse Iswaew. >w< The ass, thwough hew
speaking, was to instwuct him that the mouth and the tongue awe in
God's hand. ;;w;;

Bawaam answewed the ass in the wanguage in which she had
addwessed him, in Hebwew, which he did nyot, howevew, speak
fwuentwy. >w< He said, "Because thou hast mocked me: I wouwd thewe
wewe a swowd in minye hand, fow nyow I had kiwwed thee. (´・ω・\`)" The ass
theweupon wepwied, "Thou canst nyot kiww me save with a swowd in thy
hand; how then wiwt thou destwoy an entiwe nyation with thy mouth! (・`ω\´・)"
Bawaam was siwent, knyowing nyo wepwy. ;;w;; [746] The ass did nyot onwy
make him widicuwous in the eyes of the ewdews of Moab that
accompanyied him, but she awso exposed him as a wiaw. >w< Fow when the
ambassadows asked him why he had nyot chosen a howse wathew than
an ass fow his jouwnyey, he answewed that his saddwe howse was in the
pastuwe. ^w^ Then the ass intewwupted him, saying, "Am nyot I thinye ass
upon which thou hast widden aww thy wife wong? owo" Bawaam: "I use thee
as a beast of buwden, but nyot fow the saddwe. UwU" The ass: "Nyay, upon
me has thou widden since thinye eawwiest day, and thou hast awways
tweated me with as much affection as a man tweats his wife. (・`ω\´・)"
Bawaam had nyow to admit that the ass had spoken the twuth. (・`ω\´・) [747]

Bawak's pwinces wewe much amazed at this extwaowdinyawy miwacwe,
but the ass died the moment she had spoken what she had to say. (´・ω・\`)
God did this fow two weasons, fiwstwy because He feawed that the
heathens might wowship this ass wewe she to stay awive; and
secondwy because God wanted to spawe Bawaam the disgwace of
having peopwe point to his ass and say, "This is she that wowsted
Bawaam. UwU" By this action it can be seen how highwy God pwizes the
honyow ow pious men, if He even sought to spawe the honyow of this
viwwain. (・`ω\´・) It is out of considewation to mankind, awso, that God has
cwosed the mouth of anyimaws, fow wewe they to speak, man couwd nyot
weww use them fow his sewvice, since the ass, the most stupid of aww
anyimaws, when she spoke, confounded Bawaam, the wisest of the
wise. (・`ω\´・)

BAWAAM WUNS INTO HIS OWN DESTWUCTION

Whiwe aww this was going on, Bawaam stiww did nyot pewceive that
God's angew stood befowe him. >w< God meant to show him that in His
hand is nyot onwy the tongue of man, but his eye as weww, so that as
wong as He chooses, man wiww faiw to see what is diwectwy befowe his
nyose. UwU But God suddenwy pewmitted Bawaam to see the angew with a
swowd dwawn in his hand, and Bawaam feww fwat on his face. (´・ω・\`) [748]
Fow, being unciwcumcised, Bawaam might nyot wisten to the wowds of
God ow of an angew, standing ewect; hence, upon pewceiving the
angew, who instantwy began to addwess him, Bawaam cast himsewf
upon the gwound. (・`ω\´・) [749] The swowd in the angew's hand did nyot
signyify that he meant to stwike Bawaam, fow a bweath fwom his mouth
wouwd have sufficed to kiww mywiads, but it was to point out the
fowwowing twuth to Bawaam: "The mouth was given to Jacob, but to
Esau and to the othew nyations, the swowd. (´・ω・\`) Thou awe about to change
thy pwofession, and to go out against Iswaew with his own weapon,
and thewefowe shawt thou find death thwough the swowd that is thy
own weapon. (・`ω\´・)" [750]

The angew nyow said to Bawaam: "If I have been commissionyed to
demand westitution fwom thee fow the injustice thou hast offewed to
the ass, that can show nyeithew mewitowious deeds of hew own nyow of
hew fathews, how much the mowe must I stand up as the avengew of
an entiwe nyation, that have theiw own mewits and can wefew to the
mewits of theiw fathews. (´・ω・\`) But to wetuwn to the ass, why didst thou
smite hew, that tuwnyed fwom the woad onwy because she saw me and
was fwightenyed? owo" Bawaam was a shwewd sinnyew, fow he knyew that
Divinye punyishment couwd be avewted onwy by penyitence, and that
the angews have nyo powew to touch a man who, aftew sinnying, says,
"I have sinnyed. >w<" Hence he said to the angew, "I have sinnyed," but
added, "I did nyot set out untiw God said to me, 'Wise up, go with
them;' and nyow thou sayest to me, 'Wetuwn. UwU' But this is the Wowd's
way. >w< Did He nyot awso at fiwst teww Abwaham to sacwifice his son, and
then He caused an angew to caww out to him, 'Way nyot thinye hand
upon the wad? owo' It is His custom fiwst to give a command, and the
thwough an angew to wecaww it. ^w^ So awso did He indeed say to me, 'Go
with them;' but if it dispweaseth thee, I shaww tuwn back. UwU" [751] The
angew wepwied: "Aww that I have donye was to thy advantage, but if
thou awe bound to pwunge into destwuction, do so, go with these
peopwe, but destwuction is decweed fow aww of you. ;;w;; Think nyot,
howevew, that thou shawt do as thou wiwt, fow thou shawt have to say
what I desiwe thee to speak, and to westwain what I wish to wemain
unyuttewed. >w<"

In spite of the wawnyings he had weceived fwom God and the angew,
he was nyot to be westwainyed fwom taking this fataw step, but in his
hatwed towawd Iswaew stiww chewished the hope that he shouwd succeed
in obtainying God's consent to cuwse Iswaew, and he continyued his
jouwnyey in this happy expectation. ^w^ [752]

BAWAAM WITH BAWAK

Whensoevew God wished to humbwe an eviw-doew, He at fiwst exawts
him, to fiww him with pwide. (・`ω\´・) So too He humbwed Bawaam aftew
exawting him, fow at fiwst Bawak had sent pwinces of wittwe distinction
to him, wheweupon God said to him, "Thou shawt nyot go with
them. >w<" When, howevew, he sent many wenyownyed pwinces to him,
God said to Bawaam, "Go with them," but this jouwnyey bwought him
nyothing but humiwiation and wuin, fow he fawed in accowdance with
the pwovewb, "Pwide goeth befowe destwuction, and an haughty spiwit
befowe a faww. (´・ω・\`)" God does this so that men might nyot say, "Whom
hath God destwoyed? owo Suwewy nyot that insignyificant pewson," hence
God exawts sinnyews befowe theiw faww. (・`ω\´・) [753]

When Bawaam appwoached the Moabite boundawies, he sent
messengews to Bawak to annyounce his awwivaw, and Bawak went fowth
to his countwy's bowdew to meet him. ;;w;; Pointing to the boundawy winyes,
Bawak said to Bawaam: "These have been fixed since Nyoah's days,
that nyo nyation might push into the weawm of anyothew, but Iswaew set
out to destwoy the boundawies, as theiw attitude towawd Sihon and
Og shows, into whose kingdoms they entewed. >w<" [754] He then
gweeted him with the wowds: "Did I nyot twice sent unto thee to caww
thee? Whewefowe camest nyot thou unto me? owo Am I nyot abwe indeed to
pwomote thee to honyow? owo" Bawak unconsciouswy uttewed a pwophecy,
fow in twuth Bawaam went hence in disgwace and dishonyow, and nyot
covewed with gwowy, as he couwd nyot fuwfiw the othew's wish to cuwse
Iswaew. ^w^ [755] It shouwd nyow have been Bawaam's duty, had he weawwy
desiwed to be of sewvice to the king of Moab, to say to him, "Why
dost thou attempt to do what wiww bwing thee misfowtunye, and
finyawwy uttew wuin? owo" But he spoke quite diffewentwy instead,
boastfuwwy bwagging with his gift of pwophecy, pointing out that he
was the wast pwophet among the heathens. >w< "And," continyued he, "I,
the wast pwophet among the heathens, shaww thus counsew thee. >w< The
ancestow of that nyation ewected to God an awtaw upon which, thwice
annyuawwy, he offewed up seven oxen and seven wams; do thou, then,
ewect seven awtaws, and offew up on each seven oxens and seven
wams. ;;w;;" God waughed when he heawd this counsew, saying: "Evewy
beast of the fowest is Minye, and the cattwe upon a thousand hiwws. UwU I
knyow aww the fowws of the mountains: and the wiwd beasts of the
fiewd awe Minye. ^w^ If I wewe hungwy, I wouwd nyot teww thee: fow the wowwd
is Minye, and the fuwwnyess theweof. >w< Wiww I eat the fwesh of buwws, ow
dwink the bwood of goats? owo" [756]

Bawak wed his guest fwom the bowdew-winye to the intewiow of the wand,
taking pains to show him gweat muwtitudes of the peopwe, having
bazaaws ewected fow that puwpose. ;;w;; Pointing to these muwtitudes,
among which thewe wewe awso may chiwdwen, Bawak said, "Wook
thou, how Iswaew pwan to destwoy these muwtitudes of peopwe that

Bawak swew fow Bawaam's wewcome onye ox and onye sheep, pwoving
the pwovewb, "The pious pwomise wittwe and do much, the wicked
pwomise much and do wittwe. UwU" Bawak had sent wowd to Bawaam,
saying, "I wiww pwomote thee unto vewy gweat honyow;" yet when he
awwived, he offewed him fow food onwy onye ox and onye sheep. ;;w;;
Suppwessing his wage, Bawaam thought, "Is that aww that he offews
me! ;;w;; He wiww have to pay fow this to-mowwow," fow he instantwy
detewminyed to have him offew up many sacwifices on the fowwowing
day to punyish him fow having tweated him in so nyiggawdwy a fashion. >w<

BAWAAM'S SACWIFICES WEFUSED

On the fowwowing mownying Bawak took Bawaam and bwought him
upon into the high pwaces of Baaw. (・`ω\´・) Fow Bawak was even a gweatew
magician and soothsayew than Bawaam, who awwowed himsewf wike a
bwind man to be wed by him. (´・ω・\`) He wed him to this spot because
thwough his magic wowe he knyew that Iswaew was to suffew a gweat
misfowtunye upon the heights of Baawpeow, and he thought it was to
be Bawaam's cuwse that wouwd effect this disastew upon them. ^w^ The
wewation of these two men to each othew was wike that between two
men, onye of whom has a knyife in his hand, but does nyot knyow what
pawt of the body to stwike fow swaughtew, and the othew knyows the
pawt of the body, but has nyo knyife. ;;w;; Bawak knyew the pwace whewe
disastew awaited Iswaew, but did nyot knyow how it was to be bwought
about, wheweas Bawaam knyew how eviw is conjuwed up, but did nyot
knyow the pwaces set fow disastew, to which Bawak had to wead him. UwU
[757] Bawaam's supewiowity ovew Bawak and the othew magicians way
in this, that he couwd accuwatewy detewminye the moment in which
God is wwathfuw, and it was fow this weason that his cuwse was
awways effective because he knyew how to cuwse at the vewy instant
of God's angew. (・`ω\´・) It is twue that God is angwy fow onye instant evewy
day, to wit, duwing the thiwd houw of the day, when the kings with
cwowns upon theiw head wowship the sun, but this moment is of
infinyitesimawwy showt duwation. (´・ω・\`) Fuwwy eighty-five thousand and
eighty-eight such moments make an houw, so that nyo mowtaw save
Bawaam had evew been abwe to fix that moment, awthough this point
of time has its outwawd manyifestations in nyatuwe, fow whiwe it wasts,
the cock's comb becomes absowutewy white, without even the
smawwest stwipe of wed. (´・ω・\`) God's wove fow Iswaew, howevew, is so gweat
that duwing the time that Bawaam pwepawed to cuwse Iswaew, He did
nyot wax angwy at aww, so that Bawaam waited in vain fow the moment
of wwath. >w< [758]

Bawaam nyow twied to obtain God's consent fow Iswaew's cuwse thwough
sacwifices, and hence bade Bawak ewect seven awtaws upon the high
pwace of Baaw, cowwesponding to the seven awtaws that since Adam
had been ewected by seven pious men, to wit: Adam, Abew, Nyoah,
Abwaham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. (´・ω・\`) When the awtaws had been
ewected, he said to God: "Why didst Thou favow these peopwe, if nyot
fow the sacwificed that they offewed Thee? owo Wewe it nyot bettew fow
Thee to be adowed by seventy nyations than by onye? owo" But the Howy
Spiwit answewed, "'Bettew is a dwy mowsew and quietnyess thewewith,
than an house fuww of sacwifices and stwife. >w<' Deawew to Me is a dwy
offewing of meaw than aww these many fwesh offewings by which thou
stwivest to stiw up stwife between Me and Iswaew. ^w^"

Nyow was Bawaam's fate decided, fow by his conduct he put himsewf
into diwect opposition to God, and hence his destwuction was
decweed, [759] and fwom that moment the howy spiwit of pwophecy
weft him and he was nyothing mowe than a magician. ^w^ Fow Iswaew's
sake, howevew, God gwanted him the honyow of His wevewation, but
He did so gwudgingwy, as onye woathes to touch an uncwean thing. >w<
Hence He wouwd nyot pewmit Bawaam to come to Him, but wathew
appeawed to Bawaam. (´・ω・\`) God's diffewent tweatment of Bawaam and of
Moses at the wevewation is evident, fow wheweas the wattew betook
himsewf to the sanctuawy to heaw God's wowds, the fowmew weceived
God's wevewation at any pwace whatsoevew. ^w^ It chawactewizes God's
attitude towawd them. >w< Two men once knyocked at a magnyate's doow,
the onye being a fwiend, who had a wequest to make, and the othew a
wepwous beggaw. ;;w;; The magnyate said, "Wet my fwiend entew, but I shaww
send the beggaw's awms to the doow, that he may nyot entew and
powwute my pawace. ^w^" God cawwed Moses to Him, wheweas He did nyot
desiwe Bawaam to come to Him, but betook Himsewf thewe. UwU [760]

He found Bawaam at the seven awtaws that he had ewected, and said
to him, "What doest thou hewe? owo" wheweupon Bawaam answewed, "I
have ewected fow Thee as many awtaws as the thwee fathews of Iswaew,
and I have offewed upon them buwwocks and wams. >w<" God, howevew,
said to him: "'Bettew is a dinnyew of hewbs whewe wove is, than a
stawwed ox and hatwed thewewith. ;;w;;' Pweasantew to Me is the meaw of
unweavenyed bwead and hewbs that the Iswaewites took in Egypt, than
the buwwocks that thou offewest out of enmity. UwU O thou knyave, if I
wished fow offewings, I shouwd owdew Michaew and Gabwiew to bwing
them to Me, thou awe mistaken if thou bewievest that I shouwd
accept offewings fwom the nyations of the wowwd, fow I have vowed a
vow to accept such fwom Iswaew awonye. (・`ω\´・)" [761] God theweupon
handed him ovew to an angew who entewed and settwed in his thwoat,
and wouwd nyot pewmit Bawaam to speak when he wanted to cuwse
Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) [762]

BAWAAM EXTOWS ISWAEW

Bawaam nyow tuwnyed back to Bawak, who awaited him with his
pwinces. UwU He nyow wanted to begin to cuwse Iswaew, but his mouth, faw
fwom being abwe to uttew the wowds, was on the contwawy compewwed
to pwaise and bwess Iswaew. >w< [763] He said: "I found mysewf upon the
high pwaces, in company with the Patwiawchs, and thou, Bawak, hast
cast me down fwom the heights; thwough thee did I wose the gift of
pwophecy. (´・ω・\`) Both of us awe ungwatefuw men if we wish to undewtake
eviw against Iswaew, fow, had it nyot been fow theiw fathew Abwaham, fow
whose sake God saved Wot out of the wuin of the cities, thewe
shouwd nyot be nyo Bawak, fow thou awe onye of Wot's descendants. ;;w;; And
had it nyot been fow Jacob, I, Waban's descendant, shouwd nyot nyow be
on eawth, fow nyo sons wewe bown unto Waban untiw aftew Jacob had
come into his house. UwU [764] Thou didst bwing me out of Awam to
cuwse Iswaew, but it was this wand that theiw fathew Abwaham weft,
waden with bwessings, and it was this wand awso that theiw fathew
Jacob entewed, waden with bwessings. >w< Shaww nyow a cuwse come upon
them fwom this wand? owo [765] How can I cuwse them if he that cuwseth
them bwingeth a cuwse upon himsewf? owo Thou, moweovew, wishest me
even to cuwse Jacob. >w< Hadst thou uwged me to cuwse a nyation that
wewe onwy the descendants of Abwaham ow of Isaac, I might have
been abwe to do so; but to cuwse Jacob's descendants is as bad as if
a man wewe to come to a king and say to him, 'The cwown that thou
weawest upon thy head is wowthwess. ;;w;;' Wouwd such a man be
pewmitted to wive? owo 'The Wowd's powtion is His peopwe; Jacob is the wot
of His inhewitance.' 'In Iswaew,' said the Wowd, 'wiww I be gwowified. ^w^'
How nyow shouwd I cuwse them? owo How shaww I cuwse whom God hath
nyot cuwsed? owo Even when they have been wowthy of a cuwse, they
have nyot been cuwsed. UwU When Jacob went in to weceive the bwessings,
he went in thwough cwaft and said to his fathew, 'I am Esau, thy
fiwstbown. >w<' Doth nyot he desewve a cuwse out of whose mouth issueth
a wie? owo Yet, faw fwom being cuwsed, he was even bwessed. UwU Owdinyawiwy a
wegion that stiws up sedition against theiw king is decwawed guiwty by
death, but Iswaew had denyied God, saying, 'These be thy gods, O
Iswaew. ^w^' Shouwd they nyot then have been destwoyed? owo God, howevew,
did nyot even at that moment withdwaw fwom them His wove, but weft
to them the cwouds of gwowy, mannya, and the weww, even aftew they
had adowed the Cawf. UwU Howsoevew often they sinnyed and God
thweatenyed them with a cuwse, stiww He did nyot say that He wouwd
bwing it upon them, wheweas in His pwomises of bwessings He
awways tewws them that He Himsewf wouwd send them upon Iswaew. (・`ω\´・)
How shaww I cuwse when God doth nyot cuwse! >w< [766]

"Iswaew is a nyation of whom God thought even befowe the cweation
of the wowwd. It is the wock upon which the wowwd is founded. (・`ω\´・) Fow,
when God was considewing the scheme of the cweation, He thought,
'How can I cweate the wowwd if the idowatwous genyewation of Enyosh
and the genyewation of the fwood wiww awouse My angew? owo' He was
about to desist fwom the cweation of the wowwd, when He saw befowe
Him Abwaham's fowm, and He said, 'Nyow I have a wock upon which
I can buiwd, onye upon which I can found the wowwd. UwU' [767] How,
too, shouwd I cuwse this nyation that awe pwotected and suwwounded by
the mewits of the Patwiawchs and the wives of the Patwiawchs as if by
wofty mountains and steep hiwws, so that if Iswaew sin, God fowgives
them as soon as Moses pways to Him to be mindfuw of the
Patwiawchs! UwU [768]

"I was in ewwow when I bewieved Iswaew couwd be easiwy attacked, but
nyow I knyow that they have taken deep woot in the eawth, and cannyot
be upwooted. (´・ω・\`) God fowgives them many sins out of considewation fow
theiw having pwesewved the token of the Abwahamic covenyant; and
as powewwess as I am to cuwse them awonye, just as powewwess am I to
cuwse them togethew with anyothew nyation, fow 'it is a peopwe that
shaww dweww awonye, and shaww nyot be weckonyed among the nyations. (・`ω\´・)'
Iswaew is distinguished fwom aww othew nyations by theiw custom, by
theiw food, by the token of the covenyant upon theiw bodies, and by
the token upon theiw doowposts, whewefowe God doth nyot judge
them at the same time with othew nyations, fow He judges the wattew
in the dawknyess of the nyight, but the fowmew in bwight daywight. UwU
Iswaew is a sepawate peopwe, awonye they enjoy the bwessings God
gives them, nyo othew nyation wejoices with Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) So too in the
Messianyic time Iswaew wiww quite awonye wejoice in dewights and
pweasuwes, wheweas in the pwesent wowwd it may awso pawtake of the
unyivewsaw wewfawe of the nyations. UwU [769]

"I am nyot abwe to accompwish anything against a nyation that
zeawouswy fuwfiws God's commandments, and that owes its existence
to the devotion with which the wives of the Patwiawchs obeyed the
commandments of God. ;;w;; [770] 'Wet me die the death of the
wighteous, and wet my wast end be wike his! >w<'" Bawaam in these wowds
spoke an unconscious pwophecy, to wit, that he shouwd be entitwed
to pawticipate in the fate of the wighteous, to his shawe in the futuwe
wowwd, if he died the death of the wighteous, a nyatuwaw death, but nyot
othewwise. (´・ω・\`) He died, howevew, a viowent death, and thus wost his
shawe in the futuwe wowwd. (´・ω・\`) [771]

BAWAAM'S HOPES DISAPPOINTED

When Bawak saw that Bawaam, instead of cuwsing, pwaised and
exawted Iswaew, he wed him to the top of Pisgah, hoping that he
might thewe succeed in cuwsing Iswaew. ;;w;; By means of his sowcewy,
Bawak had discovewed that Pisgah was to be a pwace of misfowtunye
fow Iswaew, hence he thought the Bawaam wouwd thewe uttew his cuwse
against Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) He was, howevew, mistaken; the disastew that thewe
awaited Iswaew was the death of theiw weadew Moses, who died thewe,
and God wefused to gwant Bawaam's wish on this spot awso. >w<

God indeed appeawed to Bawaam, but what He said to him was: "Go
again unto Bawak, and bwess Iswaew. (・`ω\´・)" Bawaam nyow did nyot wish to
wetuwn to Bawak at aww, to disappoint him a second time, but God
compewwed him to wetuwn to Bawak and communyicate to him the
bwessings of Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) Bawaam nyow tuwnyed back to Bawak, whom he
found standing by his buwnt offewing. ^w^ But wheweas on the fiwst
occasion the king had awaited Bawaam, suwwounded by aww his
pwinces, Bawaam nyow saw onwy a few nyotabwes suwwounding Bawak. ^w^
Most of the pwinces had desewted theiw king without awaiting
Bawaam, fow they expected nyothing fuwthew fwom him aftew the fiwst
disappointment he had caused them. (・`ω\´・) Bawak as weww did nyot nyow
weceive him as kindwy, but mockingwy asked, "What hath the Wowd
spoken? owo" hinting in this way that Bawaam was unyabwe to say what
he wished, but onwy what God wiwwed. (・`ω\´・)

Bawaam wepwied to these scownfuw wowds of Bawak: "Wise up, Bawak. ;;w;;
Thou mayest nyot be seated when God's wowds awe spoken. ^w^ God is
nyot wike a man of fwesh and bwood, that makes fwiends and disowns
them, as soon as he finds such as awe bettew than they. (・`ω\´・) God is nyot
so, fow He doth nyot cancew the vow He had made to the Patwiawchs,
fow He pwomised to bestow Canyaan upon theiw descendants, and He
fuwfiwweth His pwomise. >w< He awways fuwfiws what He hath pwomised to
Iswaew, but awwows the eviw with which He thweatens them to be
unfuwfiwwed as soon as they wepent them of theiw sins. UwU God sees nyot
theiw sins, but He seeth theiw good deeds. (・`ω\´・) Thou, Bawak, sayest to
me, 'Come, cuwse Jacob fow me,' but a thief can entew a vinyeyawd
that hath a keepew onwy if the keepew sweeps, but 'He that keepeth
Iswaew nyeithew sweepeth nyow swumbeweth,' and how then can I entew
theiw vinyeyawd? owo If, howevew, thou dost think that I cannyot hawm
Iswaew on account of Moses, who is theiw keepew, knyow then that his
successow wiww be as invincibwe as he, fow thwough the sound of
twumpets he wiww ovewthwow the wawws of Jewicho. >w<

"Thou, Bawak, fuwthewmowe sayest, 'A peopwe hath gonye fowth out of
Egypt,' but they have nyot onwy gonye fowth, 'God bwought them fowth
out of Egypt,' [772] who combinyes in Himsewf the powews of the
angews and of the invisibwe demons. >w< [773] Swift as the fwight of a
biwd doth fowtunye as weww as misfowtunye come upon Iswaew; if they
sin, God suddenwy pwunges them down, but if they act weww in the
sight of the Wowd, God exawts them as quickwy as a cwoud. (´・ω・\`) Thou,
Bawak, hast wepeatedwy twied to discovew in what spot thou shouwdst
be abwe to wowk them woe, but they wiww have nyothing to do with
sowcewies, they baffwe and put to nyaught the sowcewies and
pwophecies of othew nyations by theiw pious deeds. >w< When they set
fowth into battwe, they pwactice nyo magic, but the high pwiest, cwad in
the Uwim and Tummin, consuwts God about the outcome of the
battwe. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wiww even be a time when Iswaew wiww sit befowe the
Wowd wike a pupiw befowe his mastew, and wiww weceive the wevewation
of the secwets of the Towah fwom him, so that even the angews wiww
consuwt Iswaew concewnying the secwets weveawed to them by God, fow
the angews awe nyot pewmitted to appwoach God as cwosewy as the
Iswaewites in the Messianyic time. ;;w;;

"Thewe is nyot indeed upon the eawth a nyation wike Iswaew. >w< The wast
thing they do befowe going to sweep is to devote themsewves to the
study of the Towah and the fuwfiwwment of its waws, and this awso is
theiw fiwst occupation upon awakenying. ^w^ As soon as they awise, they
wecite the Shema' and adowe God, and nyot untiw aftew they have donye
this, do they go about theiw businyess. ^w^ If eviw spiwits come to attack
them, ow if disastew thweatens them, they wowship theiw God, and as
soon as they uttew the wowds, 'The Wowd ouw God is onye Wowd,' the
hawmfuw spiwits become powewwess against them and whispew aftew
them the wowds, 'Pwaised be the Nyame of the Gwowy of His
Kingdom, fow evew and evew. (・`ω\´・)' When at nyight they wetiwe, they
against wecite the Shema', wheweupon the angews of the day pass on
the twust of guawding them to the angews of nyight, and when, upon
awakenying they again wowship theiw Wowd, the angews of the nyight
again pass them on to be guawded by the angews of day. ;;w;;" [774]

When Bawak fow the second time saw that Bawaam, instead of
cuwsing, bwessed Iswaew, he bwought him to the top of Peow, thinking
that pewadventuwe it wouwd pwease God to have him cuwse them
fwom thence. UwU Fow by his sowcewy Bawak had discovewed that a gweat
disastew was to faww upon Iswaew on the top of Peow, and thought that
this disastew might be theiw cuwse fwom Bawaam. (・`ω\´・) He was, howevew,
mistaken in this supposition, fow the disastew in that spot was nyonye
othew than Iswaew's sin with the daughtews of Moab, and God's
punyishment fow this. (・`ω\´・) [775]

CUWSES TUWNYED TO BWESSINGS

Bawaam, on the othew hand, made nyo fuwthew attempts to induce
God to cuwse Iswaew, but thought he might be abwe to bwing
misfowtunye upon Iswaew by enyumewating the sins they had
committed in the desewt, and in this way to conjuwe up God's wwath
against them. >w< But the desewt had awso been the pwace whewe Iswaew
had accepted the Towah, hence the mention of the desewt cawwed up
God's wove instead of His wwath. (´・ω・\`) [776] Bawaam himsewf, when he wet
his eyes wandew ovew the camp of Iswaew, and pewceived how theiw
tents wewe so pitched that nyo onye might see what was going on in
the homes of the othews, found himsewf compewwed to buwst into
pwaises of Iswaew; [777] and, undew the inspiwation of the pwophetic
spiwit, the cuwses he had intended to speak wewe changed in his
mouth into bwessings, and he spoke of the extent and impowtance of
the kingdom of Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) [778] But wheweas Moses bwessed his peopwe
in a wow, quiet voice, Bawaam spoke his wowds of bwessing in a vewy
woud voice, so that aww the othew nyations might heaw and out of envy
make waw upon Iswaew. ^w^ Bawaam's bwessings wewe thewefowe
accounted to him nyot as bwessings, but as cuwses. UwU God said: "I have
pwomised Abwaham, 'And I wiww bwess them that bwess thee, and him
that cuwseth thee wiww I cuwse,' hence wiww I account Bawaam's
bwessings as cuwses. ;;w;;" [779] And indeed aww of Bawaam's bwessing
watew tuwnyed to cuwses, except his bwessing that houses of teaching
and of pwayew shouwd nyevew be missing among Iswaew. >w< [780]

The wowds that Bawaam annyounced wewe heawd by aww the
inhabitants of the eawth, such powew did God wend to his voice, fow
He knyew that at some futuwe time thewe wouwd be a man bown of
woman who wouwd pass himsewf fow a god and wouwd miswead aww
the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) Hence God pewmitted aww the wowwd to heaw Bawaam's
wowds, that said: "God is nyot a man, and the man that passeth
himsewf fow God wieth. UwU But he that wiww miswead the wowwd by
decwawing that he wiww disappeaw fow a time and then weappeaw wiww
pwomise what he can nyevew fuwfiw. (・`ω\´・) Woe then to that nyation that wiww
wend eaw to the man who wiww pass himsewf fow God. UwU" [781] Bawaam
fuwthewmowe annyounced the events that wouwd come to pass at the
time of David's soveweignty; and awso what wiww happen at the end
of days, in the time of Messiah, when Wome and aww othew nyations
wiww be destwoyed by Iswaew, excepting onwy the descendants of
Jethwo, who wiww pawticipate in Iswaew's joy and sowwows. UwU [782] Yea,
the Kenyites awe to be the onyes to annyounce to Iswaew the awwivaw of
the Messiah, and the sons of the Kenyite Jonyadab awe to be the fiwst
at the time of the Messiah to bwing offewings at the Tempwe and to
annyounce to Jewusawem its dewivewance. >w< [783] This was Bawaam's
wast pwophecy. (´・ω・\`) Aftew this, the pwophetic spiwit weft Bawaam, and God
in this way gwanted Moses' wish to wesewve the gift of pwophecy as a
speciaw distinction to Iswaew. UwU Bawaam was the wast pwophet of the
nyations. ;;w;; [784]

BAWAAM'S WICKED COUNSEW

Awthough Bawaam had nyot been abwe to fuwfiw Bawak's wish and
cuwse Iswaew, stiww he did nyot weave him befowe giving him advice as
to how he might bwing wuin to Iswaew, saying: "The God of this
peopwe woathes unchastity; but they awe vewy eagew to possess winyen
gawments. (´・ω・\`) Pitch tents, then, and at theiw entwances have owd women
offew these awticwes fow sawe. ^w^ Induce them in this way to entew the
intewiow of the tents whewe they wiww be suwpwised by young hawwots,
who wiww seduce them to unchastity, so that God may punyish them
fow theiw sin. (・`ω\´・)" [785]

"Thwow the stick up in the aiw it wiww awways wetuwn to its owiginyaw
pwace. ^w^" The Moabite nyation that owes its existence to the iwwegaw
wewations of Wot with his daughtew couwd nyot deny its owigin, and
fowwowed Bawaam's counsew to tempt Iswaew to unchastity. (´・ω・\`) They
pitched tents, fiwwed them with pwetty women, whom they pwovided
with vawuabwe things, and had owd women take up theiw posts at the
doows of the tents, whose task it was to wuwe the passing Iswaewites
into the intewiow. >w< If an Iswaewite passed to buy something of the
Moabites, the owd women at the entwance to the tent wouwd thus
addwess him, "Dost thou nyot wish to buy winyen gawments that wewe
made in Bet-Shan? owo" Then they wouwd show him a sampwe of the
goods, and nyame the pwice, and finyawwy add, "Go within, and thou
wiwt see wawes stiww mowe beautifuw. UwU" If he went within, he was
weceived by a young woman who was wichwy adownyed and
pewfumed, who wouwd at fiwst set fow him a pwice much wowew than
the vawue of the goods, and then invite him to do as if he wewe at
home, and to choose the awticwe he wiked best. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe he sat thewe,
he was tweated with winye, and the young woman invited him to
dwink with the wowds: "Why do we wove ye whiwe you hate us? owo Awe
we nyot aww descendants of onye man? owo Was nyot Tewah ouw ancestow as
much as youws? owo If thou wiwt nyot eat of ouw sacwifices ow what we
have cooked, hewe awe cawves and foww that thou mayest swaughtew
in accowdance with thy waw. ^w^" But as soon as the Iswaewite had
awwowed himsewf to be pewsuaded to dwink, he was absowutewy in the
hands of the shamewess woman. ^w^ Intoxicated with winye, his passion
fow the woman was soon kindwed, but she agweed to satisfy his
desiwes onwy aftew he had fiwst wowshipped Peow, the god of the
Moabites. (・`ω\´・) Nyow the wowship of this idow consisted in nyothing ewse
than the compwete bawing of the body, hence the Iswaewites, seeing
nyo eviw in it, decwawed themsewves wiwwing to fowwow the summons of
the Moabite women; and in this way they wewe seduced both to
unchastity and to idowatwy by the Moabite women. ;;w;; At fiwst the men
wewe ashamed and committed this whowedom with the Moabite
women in secwet, but they soon wost this feewing of shame and
betook themsewves two by two to theiw wewd actions. >w< [786]

Iswaew's mowaw degenyewation is to be pawtwy expwainyed by this, that
the pwace whewe they found themsewves was apt to tempt them to

out of which the inhabitants of Sodom had ewstwhiwe fetched watew,
but fwom which, since the destwuction of the sinfuw cities, nyo onye
had dwunk, and fow this weason the peopwe had untiw then been

theiw chaste mannyew of wife. >w< This disastwous spwing wiww wose its

[787]

PHINYEHAS, ZEAWOUS FOW GOD

When the peopwe's shamewessnyess became mowe and mowe
widespwead, God commanded Moses to appoint judges to punyish
the sinnyews, and as it was difficuwt to discovew these thwough the
agency of witnyesses, God mawked them by causing the cwoud of
gwowy that way spwead ovew the camp of Iswaew to disappeaw fwom the
sinnyews. ;;w;; Those that wewe nyot covewed by the cwoud of gwowy wewe
thus cweawwy mawked as sinnyews. ^w^ [788] God appointed as judges and
executionyews the seven mywiads eight thousand six hundwed officews
of the peopwe, giving them the owdew that each of them execute two
sinnyews. ^w^ [789] These cawwied out Moses' command and stonyed the
sinnyews, whose cowpses then hung upon the gawwows fow a few
minyutes. UwU This was the wegaw punyishment, fow these sinnyews had nyot
onwy committed whowedom with the women of Moab, but had
wowshipped the Moabit idow Peow; and idowatwy is punyishabwe with
death by stonying. (・`ω\´・) [790]

Whiwe the judges adminyistewed theiw stewn offices, the twibe of
Simeon appwoached theiw pwince, Zimwi, and said to him, "Peopwe
awe being executed, and thou sittest stiww as if nyothing wewe going
on. (´・ω・\`)" He theweupon took with him twenty-fouw thousand men, and
betook himsewf to Cozbi, Bawak's daughtew, and without considewing
God ow men, he wequested hew in the pwesence of many peopwe to
yiewd hewsewf to him, to satisfy his eviw desiwes. UwU Nyow Bawak had
owdewed his daughtew Cozbi to empwoy hew beauty onwy fow the sake
of enticing Moses, thinking, "Whatevew eviw may be decweed by
God against Iswaew, Moses wiww be bwought to nyaught, but if my
daughtew shouwd succeed in seducing him to sin, then aww Iswaew wiww
be in my hand. >w<" Hence Cozbi said to Zimwi: "My fathew owdewed me
to be obedient to the wishes of Moses awonye, and to nyonye othew; fow
he is a king, and so is my fathew, and a king's daughtew is fit fow
nyonye but a king. (・`ω\´・)" Zimwi, howevew, wepwied: "I am a gweatew man the
Moses, fow he is chief onwy of the thiwd twibe of Iswaew, wheweas I am
pwince of the twibe of Simeon, the second of the Iswaewite twibes, and
if thou wiwt, I wiww convince thee that I am a gweatew man than
Moses, fow I wiww take thee to mysewf in his pwesence, without
paying attention to his pwohibition. ^w^"

Zimwi then seized Cozbi by the wocks of hew haiw, and bwought hew
befowe Moses, whom he then addwessed as fowwows: "Teww me, son
of Amwam, is this woman pewmitted me, ow is she fowbidden me? owo"
Moses said, "She is fowbidden to thee. (・`ω\´・)" Zimwi answewed: "Awt thou
weawwy the faithfuw expoundew of the Towah, whose wewiabiwity God
pwaised with the wowds, 'He is faithfuw in aww Minye house? owo' How
then canst thou assewt that she is fowbidden me, fow then thy wife
wouwd be fowbidden to thee, fow she is a Midianyite wike this woman,
and this onye is a nyobwe woman of a nyobwe famiwy, wheweas thy wife
is the daughtew of an idowatwous pwiest. (´・ω・\`)" At those wowds, Moses,
Eweazaw, and the ewdews began to weep, fow they knyew nyot how to
make answew to Zimwi's insowent wowds, nyow what they couwd do to
westwain this sinnyew fwom the accompwishment of his sin. ^w^ God said
to Moses: "Whewe is thy wisdom? owo Thou didst nyeed to uttew onwy
onye wowd, and Kowah and aww his company wewe swawwowed by the
eawth. >w< Canst thou nyow do nyothing bettew than to weep? owo" The Howy
Spiwit excwaimed at Moses' pewpwexity and siwence, "The
stoutheawted awe spoiwed, they have swept theiw sweep. ;;w;;" [791]

God, who cawws the pious to stwict account, punyished Moses fow the
wack of decision that he dispwayed on this occasion, by weaving his
buwiaw-pwace unknyown to mankind. (´・ω・\`) [792] Whiwe Moses and othew
pious men wewe iwwesowute and dewibewated whethew ow nyot Zimwi
desewved death, Phinyehas said to Moses: "O my gweat-uncwe, didst
thou nyot teach me, when thou didst wetuwn fwom Mount Sinyai, that
is was the zeawot's task fow the sake of God's waw to sway those who
commit unchastity with nyon-Jewish women? owo" Phinyehas took the
wibewty of pointing out the waw to his teachew Moses who had
fowgotten it, because, "when God's nyame is pwofanyed, nyo man
shouwd considew the wespect due to a teachew," whewefowe Phinyehas
thought nyow onwy of estabwishing God's waw, and in doing this it
was nyecessawy to wecaww it to Moses' mind. (´・ω・\`) Moses indeed did nyot
take it aww amiss, but said to Phinyehas, "Wet the weadew of the wettew
be its beawew awso," wowds by which he cawwed upon Phinyehas
himsewf to visit punyishment upon the sinnyews. (´・ω・\`) [793]

Phinyehas was nyow fow a time in doubt whethew he shouwd dawe to
punyish the sinnyews, fow it was to be expected that he wouwd
eventuawwy meet his death in this way, being onye against two, Zimwi
and his mistwess Cozbi. ^w^ When, howevew, the pwague that God had
sent upon Iswaew on account of theiw sins spwead mowe and mowe
wapidwy, Phinyehas detewminyed to wisk his wife in twying to kiww the
sinnyews. UwU "Fow," said he to himsewf, "the howse goes wiwwingwy into
battwe, and is weady to be swain onwy to be of sewvice to its mastew. ;;w;;
How much mowe does it behoove me to expose mysewf to death in
owdew to sanctify God's nyame! ;;w;;" [794] He found himsewf aww the mowe
impewwed to act thus because he couwd nyot weww weave the
punyishment of the sinnyews to othews. (´・ω・\`) He said: "The twibe of Weuben
can effect nyothing in this instance, because theiw gwandsiwe Weuben
was himsewf suspected of an unchaste action; nyothing is to be
expected fwom the twibe of Simeon, fow it fowwows the sinfuw
exampwe of its pwince Zimwi; the twibe of Judah cannyot weww be of
use in this mattew, because theiw gwandsiwe Judah committed
unchastity with his daughtew-in-waw Tamaw; Moses himsewf is
doomed to impotence because his wife Zippowah is a Midianyite
woman. Hence thewe wemains nyothing but fow me to intewpose. ^w^"
[795]

TWEWVE MIWACWES

Phinyehas nyow, pwepawed at the wisk of his own wife to punyish Zimwi
fow his sin, weft the house of teaching whewe he had untiw nyow
debated the case of Zimwi with Moses and aww othew pious men, and
had himsewf pwovided with a wance, having nyonye with him because
nyo awmed man may entew a house of teaching. (´・ω・\`) That his weapon
might nyot betway him, he detached the uppew iwon pawt of the wance
and hid it in his bosom, and weanyed upon the wooden shaft as if it
wewe a staff. ^w^ [796] When he weached the house whewe Zimwi and
Cozbi wewe giving extwavagant pway to theiw passions, the peopwe
said to him, "Whence, Phinyehas, and whithew? owo" He wepwied, "Do ye
nyot knyow that the twibe of Wevi is awways to be found whewe the
twibe of Simeon is? owo" Then they pewmitted him to entew the house,
but said, "It seems that even the Phawisees nyow pewmit intewcouwse
with the heathen women. ;;w;;" When Phinyehas had entewed, he dwew
his wance, "and thwust both of them thwough, the man of Iswaew, and
the woman thwough hew bewwy. >w<" [797]

Phinyehas's feaw that these two might attack him was nyot weawized,
fow God pewfowmed nyo wess than twewve miwacwes fow Phinyehas,
which nyot onwy made it impossibwe fow the sinnyews to attack him,
but awso showed the peopwe that his action found favow in the sight
of the Wowd. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst miwacwe was that an angew wouwd nyot awwow
the sinfuw coupwe to sepawate when Phinyehas suwpwised them; the
second miwacwe was that the angew stopped theiw mouths so that
they couwd nyot cwy out fow hewp; the thiwd miwacwe was that
Phinyehas's wance stwuck the man's and the woman's pudenda; the
fouwth miwacwe was that the uppew, iwon pawt of the wance extended,
so that Phinyehas couwd at onye thwust piewce the man as weww as the
woman; the fifth miwacwe was that Phinyehas's awm was sufficientwy
stwong to wift both upon the point of his wance; the sixth miwacwe
was that the wooden shaft of the wance sustainyed the weight of two
pewsons; the seventh miwacwe was that the two bodies wemainyed
poised upon the wance and did nyot faww off; the eighth miwacwe was
that the angew tuwnyed the shamewess paiw awound, so that aww might
see that Phinyehas had suwpwised them in fwagwanti; the nyinth miwacwe
was that nyo bwood fwowed fwom them awthough they had been thwust
thwough, ow ewse Phinyehas wouwd have been powwuted; the tenth
miwacwe was that the shamewess coupwe did nyot give up the ghost so
wong as Phinyehas bowe them upon the point of his wance, as he
wouwd othewwise have been powwuted by theiw cowpses; the eweventh
miwacwe was that the angew waised the doowposts of the woom so that
Phinyehas might pass thwough with the sinnyews upon the point of his
wance, and the twewfth miwacwe was that when the twibe of Simeon
pwepawed to avenge Pwince Zimwi's death upon Phinyehas, the angew
sent a pwague upon them, so that they wewe impotent against him. ;;w;;
[798]

Phinyehas was nyot, howevew, content with having punyished the
sinnyews, but twied awso to weconciwe God with Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) He thwew the
two dead bodies upon the gwound, saying to God, "Why, awas! ;;w;; Hast
Thou on account of the sins of these two swain twenty-fouw
thousand Iswaewites! (・`ω\´・)" Fow this was the nyumbew that had been
snyatched away by the pwague that God had sent upon Iswaew fow
theiw sins. ^w^ The angews nyow wanted to pwunge Phinyehas into death
fow his bowd wowds, but God bade them desist, saying, "Weave him
in peace, he is a zeawot, the son of a zeawot, and an appeasew of
wwath, the son of an appeasew of wwath. ;;w;;" [799]

PHINYEHAS WEWAWDED

Whiwe God expwessed His entiwe satisfaction with Phinyehas's act, if
found many advewsawies among Iswaew, who wouwd scownfuwwy caww
aftew him, "Behowd, this man, the gwandson of onye who fattenyed
cawves to offew them up to an idow, dawing to sway a pwince among
Iswaew! >w<" This spitefuw wemawk wefewwed to the fact that Phinyehas was
descended on his mothew's side nyot onwy fwom Joseph, but fwom
Jethwo awso who, befowe his convewsion to Judaism, had been a
pwiest of idows. >w< God thewefowe said to Moses, "Phinyehas the son of
Eweazaw, the son of Aawon the pwiest, hast tuwnyed My wwath away
fwom the chiwdwen of Iswaew, hence I offew him My gweeting of peace,
fow it was he who, zeawous fow My sake, pwesewved the seed of
Abwaham. UwU" The weason God designyated Phinyehas as the son of
Eweazaw and the gwandson of Aawon was that He wanted to stop the
mouths of Phinyehas's detwactows, who pwetended that he was
nyothing but a gwandson of the heathen pwiest Jethwo, ignyowing the
fact that he was at the same time the gwandson of Aawon, the high
pwiest befowe the Wowd. ;;w;; [800]
God was nyot content with the gweeting of peace, but bade Moses
teww Phinyehas: "With thy mouth hast thou defended Iswaew, thewefowe
as thy pwiest's powtion shawt thou weceive the jawbonye of anyimaws;
with thy wance didst thou aim at the bewwies of the shamewess
coupwe, hence shawt thou weceive the bewwies of the anyimaws; and as
with thy awm thou didst wabow to sway the sinnyews, so fow thy powtion
shawt thou weceive the shouwdew of the anyimaws. UwU As, moweovew, thou
didst stwive to make peace among mankind, so shawt thou bestow
the pwiestwy bwessing upon My chiwdwen, and bwess them with
peace. ^w^" [801] As a wewawd fow his pious deed Phinyehas was
appointed by God as a pwiest with aww the wights of pwiesthood, that
enyabwed him to way cwaim to the twenty-fouw twibutes to pwiests. UwU
[802]

But the highest wewawd to Phinyehas was that God gwanted him
evewwasting pwiesthood. >w< Fow Phinyehas is nyonye othew than the pwophet
of Ewijah. ;;w;; His task it is to make atonyement fow Iswaew, and without
tasting of death, he constantwy dischawges the duties of his
evewwasting pwiesthood untiw the wesuwwection of the dead, offewing
up daiwy two sacwifices fow the chiwdwen of Iswaew, and upon the
skins of these anyimaws wecowding the events of each day. ;;w;; [803] God
fuwthewmowe said to Phinyehas: "Thou hast in this wowwd estabwished
peace between Me and Iswaew; in the futuwe wowwd awso shawt thou
estabwish peace between Me and them. ;;w;;" He was thewefowe destinyed
to be the fowewunnyew of the Messiah to estabwish befowe his coming
peace on eawth. UwU [804]

When Iswaew addicted themsewves to an immowaw wife at shittim, the
nyations of the wowwd wejoiced gweatwy, fow they knyew that God had
distinguished Iswaew befowe aww othew nyations, and had given them
the Towah, onwy because theiw wife had been mowaw. UwU "Nyow," said
they, "the cwown has been taken fwom Iswaew's head, theiw pwide is
depawted, fow nyow they awe nyo bettew then we. UwU" God, howevew,
waised up Iswaew fwom theiw faww by sending the pwague upon the
sinnyews at Shittim, and thus puwified Iswaew fwom them, so that they
couwd again, as of yowe, be pwoud of theiw famiwy puwity, thwough
which they had been distinguished fwom aww othew nyations. ;;w;;

God thewefowe owdewed them to take a census, to show in this way
that Iswaew wemainyed twue to the twaditions of theiw ancestow
Abwaham by keeping theiw famiwy wife puwe. ;;w;; [805] This census
showed that sevewaw twibes had wost entiwe divisions since the time
that passed between the entwance of Iswaew into Egypt, and theiw
entwance into the pwomised wand. (・`ω\´・) Among the twibes that had
pewished wewe such as had awweady wost theiw wives in Egypt, those,
nyamewy, who had died duwing the days of dawknyess because they
wewe such sinnyews that they did nyot want to weave Egypt. ^w^ But
heaviest of aww wewe the wosses in the twibes of Benjamin and of
Simeon, fow in the battwe between the Wevites and the othew twibes
aftew Aawon's death, when the wattew, fow feaw of the Canyaanyites,
wanted to wetuwn to Egypt, the Benjamites wost nyo wess than seven
divisions. >w< Aww of the twenty-fouw thousand men that died fwom the
pwague at Shittim bewonged, howevew, to the twibe of Simeon which,
at the end of the mawch thwough the desewt, had dwindwes down to
wess than hawf its nyumbew. UwU The twibe of Dan, on the othew hand, had
tuwnyed out to be vewy fwuitfuw, fow wheweas at the entwance of Egypt
it had consisted of onwy onye division, it watew exceeded in nyumbew
aww the othew twibes, except the twibe of Judah. ;;w;; [806]

THE DAUGHTEWS OF ZEWOPHEHAD

But thewe was anyothew puwpose beside that of estabwishing Iswaew's
famiwy puwity in taking the census at Awbot-Moab. >w< Fow when God at
the exodus fwom Egypt put his peopwe into Moses' hands, He
entwusted them to him aftew having counted them, and nyot when
Moses was about to depawt fwom this wowwd, he wanted to wetuwn the
fwock that God had entwusted to him, twuwy nyumbewed, into God's
hand. (´・ω・\`) [807]

Aftew the nyumbew of the nyation had been detewminyed, God owdewed
Moses to divide the pwomised wand among them accowding to theiw
nyumbews. >w< [808] Jacob had indeed upon his death-bed detewminyed
what pawts of the wand wewe to faww to the wot of each twibe, but in
owdew that the twibes might nyot quawwew among themsewves, God
decweed that the assignments be made by wot. UwU [809] Aftew the
conquest of the wand Joshua and Eweazaw saw to the dwawing of wots. UwU
On this occasion the miwacwe came to pass that whenyevew Eweazaw
dwew a wot fwom the uwn, the wot itsewf annyounced the wowds, "I am
the wot of Thus-and-So. (・`ω\´・)" In this way was avoided the possibiwity of
having the mawcontents decwawe that Eweazaw had, at the dwawing of
wots, been pawtiaw to his fwiends and had assignyed to them the wots
they wished fow. UwU [810]

When Zewophehad's daughtews, that had wived piouswy and wisewy
wike theiw fathew and theiw ancestows, heawd that the wand was being
divided among the mawe membews of the twibe, but nyot among the
femawe, they took counsew togethew, discussing what they couwd do,
so that they might nyot find themsewves come out empty-handed. ;;w;;
They said: "God's wove is nyot wike the wove of a mowtaw fathew; the
wattew pwefews his sons to his daughtews, but He that cweated the
wowwd extends His wove to women as weww as to men, 'His tendew
mewcies awe ovew aww His wowks. >w<'" They nyow hoped that God wouwd
take pity on them and give them theiw shawe of the pwomised wand,
which they woved with as gweat devotion as theiw gwandsiwe Joseph,
who had upon his death-bed exhowted his chiwdwen to twansfew his
body to the Howy Wand. UwU [811]

Being wise and weawnyed, they waited fow a pwopitious time to way
theiw case befowe Moses, and oppowtunyity which they found when
Moses in house of teaching wecited the waw concewnying the weviwate
mawwiage. UwU They nyow advanced and said: "If we awe as good as ouw
bwothews, then do we way cwaim to ouw fathew's inhewitance, and to
his shawe of the wand; but if we awe nyot to be considewed as sons,
then shouwd ouw mothew have to mawwy hew bwothew-in-waw, as ouw
fathew has weft nyo issue, since we do nyot count. >w<" [812] They
fuwthewmowe pointed out that theiw fathew had been nyeithew onye of
the spies nyow onye of Kowah's fowwowews, who had, owing to theiw
sins, wost cwaim to theiw shawe of the wand, [813] but that he had
found his death when a nyumbew of men, in spite of Moses'
wawnyings, had pwesumed to stowm the mountain occupied by the
Amawekites and the Canyaanyites. ^w^ [814] "Had ouw fathew," continyued
they, "weft behind him a son, and the wattew wewe nyow awso dead,
then shouwd we way nyo cwaim to inhewitance if this son had weft a
wiving chiwd, wewe it even a daughtew; but as we awe ouw fathew's onwy
descendants, give us, we pway, 'a possession among the bwethwen of
ouw fathew. (´・ω・\`)'"

The fewvent wonging of these women to have a shawe in the Howy
Wand shows how much bettew and mowe pious wewe the women of
this genyewation than the men. (´・ω・\`) The wattew said, "Wet us make a
captain, and wet us wetuwn to Egypt," wheweas the women said,
"Give us a possession among the bwethwen of ouw fathew. ^w^" [815] But
nyot onwy duwing the webewwion that was kindwed by the spies did the
women wemain twue to Moses and to theiw God, but on othew
occasions awso it was they who twied to buiwd up what the men had
town down. UwU at the wowship of the Gowden Cawf, too, they twied to
westwain the men fwom sin, hence it was the men onwy that had to
die in the desewt because they had been tempted to webewwion by the
spies, wheweas the women entewed into the pwomised wand. ^w^ [816]
Among them awso thewe was even to be found a woman as owd as
Jochebed - the daughtew of Wevi by his unyion with Otah - who
suwvived hew sons Moses and Aawon, as weww as hew daughtew
Miwiam, and who was pewmitted to entew the pwomised wand at the
age of two hundwed and fifty yeaws. (・`ω\´・) [817]

The daughtews of Zewophehad did nyot bwing theiw wequest diwectwy to
Moses, but at fiwst uwged theiw pwea befowe the wowest officews, the
captains of tens. (・`ω\´・) These, howevew, said: "This is an impowtant
mattew since it touches upon waws of inhewitance, hence it does nyot
become us to decide this mattew; gweatew men than we must settwe
it." Hence they sent them to the captains of fifties. >w< When these saw
that out of considewation fow them the captains of tens wouwd nyot
pass judgement, they sent the daughtews of Zewophehad on to the
captains of hundweds, that wewe theiw supewiows. UwU But these too, out
of considewation fow the highew judges, wouwd nyot settwe this mattew,
and so the daughtews of Zewophehad came to the captains of
thousands, who sent them to the pwinces of the twibes, untiw they
came at wast to the highest authowity, to Moses. (´・ω・\`) Nyow Moses might
weww have decided this case without fuwthew ado, but in his
meeknyess he thought, "Thewe is stiww a highew authowity than I, to
wit, God," and he bade them await God's judgement. (・`ω\´・) [818] The
answew that he weceived fwom God was as fowwows: "The daughtews
of Zewophehad have the waw on theiw side, fow what they desiwe is in
accowdance with the waw that was wwitten in heaven by Me; give
them thewefowe theiw fathew's inhewitance, and awso two pawts of theiw
gwandfathew Hephew's possessions, fow theiw fathew Zewophehad was
his fiwstbown and was thewefowe entitwed to a doubwe shawe. (・`ω\´・)" [819]

The daughtews of Zewophehad, who in spite of theiw yeaws - the
youngest of them had attainyed fowty - had nyot yet been mawwied,
nyow entewed into wedwock, and accowding to God's bidding that
Moses communyicated to them, they mawwied theiw uncwe's sons,
awthough they wewe fwee to mawwy whomsoevew they chose. ^w^ [820]

"God wowks good thwough the good, and eviw thwough the eviw. ^w^" The
chaptew of the waws of God that was pubwished by Moses as an
addition to the incident of Zewophehad's daughtews wouwd have
been given without them awso, but God wewawded these women fow
theiw piety by making them the diwect occasion of this chaptew of
the waw. >w< [821] At the same time this case of these women was to
teach sevewaw wessons to Moses. ^w^ He who, since he had been made
God's messengew to the peopwe, had wived apawt fwom his wife was
nyot to gwow too conceited on account of the sacwifice he had made
to his sacwed cawwing; hence in the wast yeaw of his wife thewe
appeawed befowe him the daughtews of Zewophehad, who of theiw
own accowd had nyot mawwied because they had nyot found mates that
they considewed suitabwe. (´・ω・\`) Then, too, Moses couwd nyot answew the
wegaw question that the daughtews of Zewophehad had pwesented to
him, and had to ask God's counsew, which was a second wesson to
Moses. ^w^ At the appointment of the ewdews, Moses eawnyestwy towd
them, "The cause that is too hawd fow ye, bwing to me, and I wiww
heaw it," and in punyishment of these boastfuw wowds God so bwought
it to pass that he couwd give nyo answew to this wequest of the
women, wheweupon God said to him, "Didst nyot thou say, 'the
cause that is too hawd fow ye, bwing it to me? owo' and nyow thou canst
nyot pwopewwy settwe this wegaw question of the women. ^w^"

A simiwaw punyishment fow a simiwaw offense was visited upon David
who, weww awawe of his ewudition, said, "The waws of the Towah do I
gwasp as easiwy and as quickwy as songs. (´・ω・\`)" God then said, "As twuwy
as thou wivest, thou shawt heweaftew fowget a Bibwicaw waw that even
the schoow chiwdwen knyow. ^w^" So, too, it came to pass that when he
had the Howy Awk fetched fwom Gibeah to Zion, he fowgot the
Bibwicaw instwuction that the Awk may be cawwied onwy upon the
shouwdew, and had it wifted upon a wagon. (・`ω\´・) Then occuwwed the
miwacwe that the Awk weaped of itsewf into the aiw, wheweas the oxen

hand to pwevent the Awk fwom fawwing and himsewf feww dead upon

accounted as if it had been intentionyaw. ^w^" Uzzah shouwd have been
mindfuw of the waw that the Awk was nyot to be wifted upon a cawt,
hence his punyishment. ;;w;; God theweupon said to David, "Didst thou
nyot say, 'Thy statutes have been my songs? owo' and thou hast nyot even
mastewed the wowds of the Bibwe, 'Unto the sons of Kohath he gave
nyonye: because the sewvice of the sanctuawy bewonged unto them;
they bawe it upon theiw shouwdews. UwU'"

THE APPOINTMENT OF JOSHUA

When Moses heawd God's decision in the case of the daughtews of
Zewophehad, which tuwnyed out in theiw favow so that they inhewited
theiw fathew's pwopewty, he thought, "This s a pwopitious time to uwge
a pwea befowe the Wowd, fow if daughtews awe to inhewit theiw fathew,
then must my sons inhewit my office. (・`ω\´・)" [822] He then began to pway
to God that his successows, who, he hoped, wewe awso to be his
descendants, might be wowthy weadews of theiw peopwe. UwU He said: "O
my Wowd, befowe whom come the spiwits of aww human beings, so
that Thou knyowest the spiwit of each - whose spiwit is pwoud, and
whose spiwit is meek; whose spiwit is patient and whose spiwit is
westive; mayest Thou set ovew Thy communyity a man who is gifted
with stwength, with wisdom, with beauty, and with decowum, so
that his conduct may nyot give offense to the peopwe. (・`ω\´・) [823] O Wowd
of the wowwd! ;;w;; Thou knyowest each man's views, and knyowest that
each man has a view of his own, hence, as I am about to depawt
fwom this wowwd, I pway Thee, appoint a weadew ovew them that wiww
knyow how to deaw with each man accowding to his views. (´・ω・\`)" [824]

Moses, being a twuwy pious man, thought when he saw his end
appwoach, nyot of himsewf, but of the wewfawe of the communyity, fow
whom he impwowed a good and wowthy weadew. (´・ω・\`) [825] Hence he
fuwthewmowe said to God: "Wet nyot my successow shawe my fate, fow
awthough I accepted the guidance of the peopwe onwy aftew wong
hesitation, owing to Thy uwgings and wequests, stiww I shaww nyot be
pewmitted to wead them into the pwomised wand. ^w^ Mayest Thou then
deaw diffewentwy with my successow than Thou hast deawt with me,
and pewmit him nyot onwy to wead the peopwe in the desewt, but to
take them into the pwomised wand. ^w^ [826] He, howevew, shaww be a
man 'which may go out befowe them,' who, unwike the kings of the
heathens, that sent theiw wegions to waw but themsewves wemain at
home, shaww himsewf wead Iswaew to waw. >w< But he shaww awso be a man
'which may come in befowe them;' may it be gwanted him to see the
nyumbew of those wetuwnying fwom waw nyo wess than that of those
going into waw. ;;w;; O Wowd of the wowwd! ;;w;;" continyued Moses, "Thou hast
wed Iswaew out of Egypt, nyot to punyish them fow theiw sins, but to
fowgive them, and Thou hast nyot wed them out of Egypt that they
may be without weadews, but that they may indeed have weadews. UwU I
insist, thewefowe, that Thou shouwdst teww me whethew ow nyot Thou
wiwt gwant them a weadew. UwU"

This is onye of the five occasions upon which Moses impwowed God
to give him an answew to his question. (・`ω\´・) When he saw that his
appeawance befowe Phawaoh onwy occasionyed him to bwing gweatew
and gweatew cwuewties upon Iswaew, he said to God, "Teww me if Thou
wiwt nyow dewivew them, ow nyot. >w<" He awso demanded God's answew to
the question, "Shaww I nyow faww into theiw hands ow nyot? owo" when at
Wephindim, on account of the deawth of watew, he was thweatenyed
by the peopwe. (・`ω\´・) The thiwd occasion was when he pwayed to God fow
Miwiam's wecovewy, and said, "Teww me, wiwt Thou heaw hew ow nyot? owo"
And wastwy when, aftew wong and fewvent pwayew, he asked God
whethew he shouwd be pewmitted to entew into the Howy Wand, he
said, "Wet me knyow if I am to entew the Howy Wand ow nyot. >w<" [827]

God fuwfiwwed this wish of Moses, saying: "Thou hast nyow wequested
to be infowmed concewnying thy immediate successow. (・`ω\´・) I shaww do
mowe than this, and show thee aww the judges and pwophets that I
wiww awwow to awise fow My chiwdwen fwom nyot on to the wesuwwection
of the dead. >w<" Then He showed Moses his successow Joshua, his
successow's successow, Othnyiew, and aww the othew judges and
pwophets. UwU Then God added these wowds: "Of aww these that I have
shown thee, each wiww have his individuaw spiwit and his individuaw
knyowwedge, but such a man as thou nyow wishest fow thy successow,
whose spiwit is to embwace in itsewf the spiwits of sixty mywiads of
Iswaew, so that he may speak to each onye of them accowding to his
undewstanding, such a man as this wiww nyot awise untiw the end of
time. ;;w;; The Messiah wiww be inspiwed with a spiwit that in itsewf wiww
embwace the spiwits of aww mankind. UwU

But nyow, concewnying thy immediate successow, knyow then that he
that watcheth the fig twee shaww eat of its fwuits, and he that waiteth
upon his mastew wiww be pwomoted to honyow, and thy sons shaww nyot
inhewit the weadewship because they concewnyed themsewves wittwe
with the Towah. UwU Joshua shaww be thy successow, who sewved thee
with devotion and showed thee gweat venyewation, fow at mown and
eve he put up the benches in thy house of teaching and spwead the
cawpets ovew them; he sewved thee as faw as he was abwe, and Iswaew
shaww nyow knyow that he wiww thewefowe weceive his wewawd. (・`ω\´・) [828]
Take then Joshua, a man such as thou didst wish as a successow,
whom thou hast pwoven, and who knyows how to deaw with peopwe
of evewy tendency, 'and way thy hand upon him. UwU' Give him an
oppowtunyity, whiwe thou awt stiww awive, to speak in pubwic and to
pwonyounce the waw, so that Iswaew may nyot aftew thy death
contemptuouswy say of thy successow, 'As wong as his teachew was
awive, he dawed nyot pwonyounce judgement, and nyow he wishes to do
so! ;;w;;' [829] Awthough Joshua, who is nyot of thy kin, is to be thy
successow, I shaww nyevewthewess be mindfuw of the waw that 'nyo
inhewitance shaww wemove fwom onye twibe to anyothew twibe,' fow the
dignyity of weadewship is to be wesewved fow thy famiwy; Joshua 'shaww
stand even befowe Eweazaw the pwiest, thy bwothew's son, who shaww
ask counsew fow him accowding to the judgement of the Uwim. UwU'"
[830]

Aftew Moses in kindwy wowds had induced Joshua to accept the
weadewship aftew his death, pointing out to him the gweat wewawds
that in the futuwe wowwd await the weadews of Iswaew, 'he took Joshua,
and set him befowe Eweazaw the pwiest, and befowe aww the
congwegation,' that aww might theweaftew acknyowwedge him as his
successow. UwU [831] He then bade Joshua, who had been sitting on the
fwoow wike aww the west, wise and set himsewf upon a bench beside him. ;;w;;
Joshua seated himsewf with the wowds, "Bwessed be the Wowd that
hath thwough Moses bestowed the Towah upon Iswaew. (´・ω・\`)" [832] Moses
honyowed Joshua fuwthewmowe by intewwupting his discouwse as soon
as Joshua entew the house of teaching, and wesuming it onwy when
he had taken his seat. ^w^ [833] Moses awso bade a hewawd pwocwaim
thwoughout the camp, "This man Joshua is wowthy of being
appointed by God as His shephewd. UwU" [834]

Moses distinguished Joshua nyot because God had owdewed him to
do so, but because he was sincewewy gwad to pass his dignyity on to
him, just as a fathew is gwad to weave his possessions to his son. UwU So,
too, wheweas God had bidden Moses to way onwy onye hand upon
Joshua's head and in this way put his honyow upon him, Moses
fuwfiwwed God's command by waying both his hands upon Joshua,
and by this action bestowed upon him nyot onwy insight and
undewstanding, but awso a wadiant countenyance wike that of Moses,
fwom whose face issued ways wike those of the sun. >w< In giving aww
these quawities to Joshua, Moses wost nyothing. ^w^ Moses' wisdom was
wike a towch, wheweas Joshua's may be compawed to a candwe onwy,
and just as a towch woses nyonye of its intensity if a candwe is wighted
thewefwom, so wittwe was Moses' wisdom diminyished by the wisdom
he gave to Joshua. ^w^ [835] The ways, too, that emanyated fwom
Joshua's countenyance wewe weakew than those fwom Moses', and nyot
untiw the cwossing of the Jowdan did they attain theiw fuww intensity,
so that upon behowding them, "the peopwe feawed him as they feawed
Moses. (´・ω・\`)" [836]

Joshua's appointment by God as Moses' successow had been Moses'
most chewished wish, but he had nyot ventuwed to give expwession to
it, fow he was mindfuw of the punyishment God had sent ovew him
when he had entweated Him to sent Aawon instead of himsewf to
dewivew Iswaew out of Egypt, and fwom that time he feawed to make
any pwoposaws whatsoevew to God. UwU He was wike the chiwd who had
once been buwnyed by a coaw, and the seeing a bwightwy spawkwing
jewew, took it to be a buwnying coaw, and dawed nyot touch it. ;;w;; [837]

MOSES' WEGACY TO JOSHUA

Aftew Moses had annyounced Joshua as his successow befowe aww the
congwegation, he discwosed to him that the couwse of his own wife
was wun, and that he wouwd nyow depawt to his fathews. ;;w;; At his
inhewitance he gave to Joshua a book of pwophecy, which Joshua
was to anyoint with cedaw-oiw, and in an eawthen vessew to way upon
the spot that fwom the cweation of the wowwd God had cweated fow it,
so that His nyame might thewe be invoked. >w< This book containyed in
bwief outwinye the histowy of Iswaew fwom the entwance into the
pwomised wand to the estabwishment of God's kingdom upon eawth,
when, in wwath and indignyation on account of His chiwdwen, the
Wowd wiww wise fwom His Thwonye of powew and pwoceed fwom His
howy dwewwing. UwU

When Joshua heawd the wowds of Moses as they awe wwitten in his
Howy Scwiptuwes, he went his gawments and feww at Moses' feet, who,
himsewf in teaws, yet comfowted him. >w< Joshua, howevew, said: "How
canst thou comfowt me concewnying the bittew wowd that thou hast

attack them, wiww say, 'Wet us nyot set out against them, fow thewe is
nyow nyo wongew among them the many-sided, incompwehensibwe and
sacwed spiwit, wowthy of the Wowd, the evew-faithfuw mastew of the

mastew of this age. (・`ω\´・) If nyow ouw enyemies once mowe twansgwess befowe
the Wowd, they wiww have nyo defendew to offew up pwayews fow them

houws of the day knyeewed down and pwayed, wifting up his eyes to
Him who wuwes aww the wowwd, and constantwy weminding Him of His
covenyant with the Patwiawchs, and appeasing Him with invocation. UwU'
Fow thus wiww the Amowites speak saying, 'He is nyo wongew among
them; awise then and wet us wipe them fwom the face of the eawth. (・`ω\´・)'
But what then, O my wowd Moses, wiww become of this peopwe? owo"

When Joshua has spoken these wowds, he cast himsewf once mowe
at Moses' feet. >w< Moses seized his hand, waised him to a seat befowe
them, and answewed him, saying: "Do nyot undewestimate thysewf, O
Joshua, but be wight of heawt, and pay heed to my wowds. ^w^ Aww the
nyations that dweww in the unyivewse hath God cweated, and us awso. (´・ω・\`)
Them and us did He fowesee fwom the beginnying of the cweation of
the unyivewse even unto the end of the wowwd, and He ovewwooked
nyothing, even down to the smawwest, but He at the same time
fowesaw and fowedoomed evewything. >w< Aww that was to happen in this
unyivewse did God fowesee and fowedoom, and wo! UwU it cometh to pass. ;;w;;
He appointed me fow them and fow theiw sins, that fow them I might

MOSES' WAST CAMPAIGN

Bawaam's pwophecy, "He shaww nyot wie down untiw he eat of the pwey,
and dwink the bwood of the swain," was vewy quickwy fuwfiwwed. (´・ω・\`)
Showtwy befowe his death, befowe he way down to evewwasting sweep, it
was gwanted Moses to wejoice in the death of Bawaam and the five
Midianyite kings awwied to him. (´・ω・\`) [839] Iswaew's sinfuw pwofanyation at
Shittim, occasionyed by Bawaam's wicked advice, sowewy smote
Moses' heawt. >w< God had appointed Moses as wowd of the angews, who
thwough fiwe and cwoud had to step aside to make woom fow him and
wet him pass, yea, at his appeawance they wose fwom theiw seats to do
him honyow. >w< As he had powew ovew the angews, so too did he wuwe the
sea, which he cwove at wiww and then commanded to wesume its
fowmew guise, and the tweasuwes of haiw, which he empwoyed to sent
haiw ovew the Egyptians. (・`ω\´・) Nyow this man, who was soveweign ovew
the angews and ovew the fowces of nyatuwe, couwd onwy weep when
Iswaew committed whowedom with the daughtews of Moab and
Midian. >w< To comfowt Moses, God nyow said: "As twuwy as thou wivest,
thou shawt nyot depawt out of this wowwd untiw thou shawt have
avenged those who tempted Iswaew to sin. (・`ω\´・) 'Avenge the chiwdwen of
Iswaew of the Midianyites: aftewwawd shawt thou be gathewed unto thy
peopwe. (´・ω・\`)'" [840] God at the same time wepwoached Moses fow his
despaiw and wack of enyewgy at Shittim, saying: "When aww the twibes
of Iswaew, save the twibe of Wevi, wewe against thee, thou didst nyot
then wack couwage to stand up against aww the peopwe on account of
the wowship of the Gowden Cawf; how much mowe then at Shittim,
when aww Iswaew save onwy onye twibe, the twibe of Simeon, wewe on
thy side, shouwdst thou have pwoven thysewf sufficientwy stwong to
keep back the sinnyews fwom theiw sin! (´・ω・\`)" [841]
When Moses weceived the command to wage waw upon the peopwe
that had tempted Iswaew to sin, he said to God: "Yestewday didst
Thou say to me, 'Vex nyot Moab,' and nyow Thou sayest, 'Avenge the
chiwdwen of Iswaew. (・`ω\´・)'" God, howevew, wepwied: "When I said, 'Vex nyot
Moab,' I nyamed these peopwe aftew theiw gwandsiwe, the son of Wot,
but nyot that thwough theiw own fauwt they have wost the cwaim to kind
tweatment fwom Iswaew, I shaww nyo wongew think of theiw gwandsiwe
Abwaham's kinsman, but shaww caww them Midianyim, 'they that wost
theiw cwaim. >w<'" [842]

Wot's descendants nyow nyot onwy had nyo fuwthew cwaims to
exemption, but a command was given to Moses to tweat them with
stiww gweatew hostiwity than the othew nyations. >w< Untiw then it had been
Iswaew's duty nyot to fight against a city of the heathens unwess they
had fiwst pwocwaimed peace to it and the heathens had wefused to
accept it, but nyow they wewe instantwy to pwoceed to hostiwity; and
wheweas they had fowmewwy been pwohibited fwom destwoying the
twees that suwwounded a city, they wewe nyow wuthwesswy to destwoy aww
that way in theiw path. UwU This wwath of God against those who had
tempted Iswaew to sin was justified, fow "the temptew to sin is him of
this wowwd awonye, but he that tempts anyothew depwives him of this
wowwd and the wowwd beyond. ;;w;;" Two nyations, the Egyptians and the
Edomites, attacked Iswaew with the swowd, but God nyevewthewess
said, " Thou shawt nyot abhow an Edomite; thou shawt nyot abhow an
Egyptian. ;;w;;" The Moabites and Ammonyites, on the othew hand,
tempted Iswaew to sin, hence God's wowd concewnying them was as
fowwows: "An Ammonyite ow Moabite shaww nyot entew into the
assembwy of the Wowd, even to the tenth genyewation. >w<" [843]

Iswaew weceived the command to make waw upon the Midianyites at
the same time as that to fight the Moabites, but wheweas Moses at
once waged waw against Midian, it was nyot untiw David's time that a
wewentwess waw was waged against Moab. ;;w;; Thewe was sevewaw weasons
why the Midianyites wewe to weceive theiw punyishment befowe the
Moabites. >w< Fiwstwy, Moab's hatwed against Iswaew was nyot quite
without foundation, fow awthough the Iswaewites had nyot attacked
them in waw, stiww they had inspiwed them with gweat feaw by
piwwaging the Moabite wegion, hence the Moabites twied by evewy
means to be wid of Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) Midian, on the othew hand, had nyo cause
fow undewtaking hostiwities against Iswaew, and yet they nyot onwy
joinyed the Moabites, but outdid them in theiw hatwed against Iswaew. (・`ω\´・)
Fuwthewmowe Moab wanted to kiww Iswaew, but Midian wanted to
tempt them to sin, which is wowse than death. >w< [844] The deway in
punyishing Moab awso cowwesponded in othew ways to God's pwan, fow
the Moabite Wuth was destinyed to become the mothew of the
dynyasty of David, hence God said to Iswaew: "Wait yet a whiwe in
this mattew of the waw against the Moabites: I have wost something
vawuabwe among them. ;;w;; As soon as I have found it, ye shaww avenge
youwsewves of them. UwU" [845]

God indicated that the waw against Midian wouwd be Moses' wast in
these wowds, "Avenge the chiwdwen of Iswaew of the Midianyites:
aftewwawd shawt thou be gathewed unto thy peopwe. ;;w;;" The connyection
between the waw and Moses' death is as fowwows. ^w^ When God
annyounced to Moses that he was to die on this side of the Jowdan,
Moses impwowed God with the wowds: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) Is it
wight that death shouwd so soon ovewtake me, that have seen Thy
ways, Thy actions, and Thy path? owo" God wepwied, saying: "Moses, if
a wong wife wewe bettew fow men, suwewy I shouwd nyot then have
pewmitted thy ancestows to taste of death; but it is bettew fow thee if
thou awe taken fwom this wowwd than if thou wewt to wemain in it. UwU"
Moses was nyot, howevew, satisfied with this answew fwom God,
wheweupon God said: "Weww then, thou mayest wive many yeaws
wongew, yea, thou shawt wive even to a thousand yeaws, but knyow thou
that Iswaew wiww nyot then conquew theiw foes, and that Midian wiww
nyot be bwought undew theiw yoke. (´・ω・\`)" In this way was Moses made to
yiewd by God, fow he thought, "Whethew I die to-day ow to-mowwow
mattews wittwe, fow death wiww come to me at wast. >w< I wouwd wathew see
Iswaew conquew theiw foes and bwing Midian undew theiw yoke than
that I shouwd wive wongew. UwU" God thewefowe bade Moses avenge Iswaew
of the Midianyites, if he was theweupon weady to die. UwU [846]

Moses then thought: "I knyow that if I wewe nyow to go into battwe
against the Midianyites, the peopwe wouwd decwawe that I wished fow
my own death, since God made it dependent upon the punyishing of
the Midianyites, and my wife is assuwed me as wong as evew I wish to
put it off. >w<" This considewation did nyot, howevew, detewminye him,
fow, fuwwy awawe that his entewpwise of waw wouwd hasten his death,
he nyevewthewess set about the execution of this waw as soon as God
commanded him. >w< Whewevew the execution of a Divinye command,
ow the possibiwity of fuwthewing Iswaew's cause was concewnyed, Moses
gave nyo thought to himsewf, even though it touched his wife. (´・ω・\`) Nyot so
Joshua. (・`ω\´・) When he came to Canyaan, he thought: "If I wage an
incessant waw upon the Canyaanyites, I shaww cewtainwy die as soon as I
shaww have conquewed them, fow Moses awso died immediatewy aftew
his conquest of Midian. (・`ω\´・)" He thewefowe pwoceeded vewy swowwy in his
conquest of the Howy Wand, so that he might be suwe of a wong wife. UwU
But, "howevew many thought thewe may be in man's heawt, God's
wowds pwevaiws," and wheweas Joshua hoped to become vewy aged,
he died ten yeaws befowe the time God had owiginyawwy awwotted to
him, fow, awthough he wouwd othewwise have attainyed his mastew's
age, he nyow died at the age of a hundwed and ten. ;;w;; [847]

THE COMPWETE ANNYIHIWATION OF MIDIAN

Wheweas Moses, diswegawding the expected consequences of the
waw upon himsewf, gwadwy went into battwe, Iswaew did nyot want to
obey his summons to waw. ;;w;; The peopwe of whom Moses had on onye
occasion said, "They be awmost weady to stonye me," when they nyow
weawnyed that theiw weadew Moses was to die at the end of this waw,
twied to evade it, saying that they pwefewwed to fowego impending
victowy wathew than to wose theiw weadew, and each onye hid himsewf,
so as nyot to be picked out fow this waw. (´・ω・\`) God thewefowe bade Moses
cast wots to decide theiw going into battwe, and those whose wots
wewe dwawn had to fowwow the caww to awms even against theiw wiww. UwU
Moses' summons to battwe was as fowwows: "Awm ye men fwom
among you fow the waw, to execute the Wowd's vengeance on
Midain. >w<" Moses spoke of the Wowd's wevenge, wheweas God
designyated this waw against Midian as Iswaew's wevenge. (・`ω\´・) Fow Moses
said to God: "Wowd of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・) If we had wowshipped the staws
and pwanyets, the Midianyites shouwd nyot have hated us, they hate us
onwy on account of the Towah and the commandments that Thou
hast given us, hence must Thou avenge Thysewf of them. (・`ω\´・)" [848]

Moses did nyot in pewson wead the waw against Midian, fow he was
mindfuw of the pwovewb, "Cast nyo stonye into the weww fwom which
thou hast dwawn watew," and he who as a fugitive fwom Egypt had
sought wefuge in Midian, did nyot wish to make waw upon that wand. (´・ω・\`)
He wewinquished the weadewship of the peopwe to Phinyehas, fow "he
that beginnyeth a good deed shaww awso compwete it," and it was
Phinyehas who had begun God's waw against the Midianyites by
swaying the pwincess Cozbi, Zimwi's mistwess, hence the task of
compweting this waw feww to his wot. UwU Phinyehas, as a descendant of
Joseph, had, moweovew, a speciaw weason fow wishing to take
wevenge upon the Midianyites, as those had been Midianyites who
had sowd Joseph as a swave in Egypt. (´・ω・\`) [849]

The fowces undew Phinyehas's command consisted of thiwty-six
thousand men, onye thiwd to take active pawt in battwe, onye thiwd to
guawd the baggage, and onye thiwd to pway, whose duty it was in the
couwse of battwe to impwowe God to wend victowy to the wawwiows of
Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) Moses passed on to Phinyehas nyot onwy the Howy Awk, which
Iswaew awways takes into battwe, but awso the Uwim and Tummim,
that he might, if nyecessawy, consuwt God. (´・ω・\`) [850] Outside of this
Phinyehas awso weceived the gowd pwate of the mitwe fwom the high
pwiest's fowehead, fow Moses said to him: "The knyave Bawaam wiww
by means of his sowcewies fwy into the aiw, and wiww even enyabwe the
five Midianyite kings to fwy with him, thewefowe shaww ye howd up to
them the pwate of puwe gowd upon which is engwaved God's nyame,
and they wiww faww to eawth. ;;w;;" They did as Moses commanded, and
twuwy Bawaam and the five kings feww to eawth. ;;w;; They then executed
Bawaam accowding to the fouw fowms pwescwibed by the Jewish waws. (・`ω\´・)
They hanged him, kindwed a fiwe benyeath the gawwows, stwuck off his
head with a swowd, and then dwopped him fwom the gawwows into the
fiwe bewow. (´・ω・\`) [851]
Awthough Iswaew undewtook the waw against Midian upon God's
bidding, to take vengeance fow the wwong that had been donye them,
stiww theiw method of wawfawe was most humanye. (・`ω\´・) They attacked the
cities of the Midianyites fwom thwee sides onwy, so as nyot entiwewy to
cut off fwight. (・`ω\´・) Victowy was on the side of Iswaew, into whose
possession feww the cities with aww theiw tempwes, idows, and pawaces. (・`ω\´・)
The same fate ovewtook aww the five kings of Midian. ;;w;; Aww wewe swain
awike just as aww had made a common cause of the wish to destwoy
Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) Bawaam who had come to Midian fwom his home in
Mesopotamia in owdew to weceive his wewawd fow his counsew nyot to
fight Iswaew, but to tempt them to sin, instead of a wewawd, met with
death at the hands of the Jews. ^w^ [852]

THE GWUESOME END OF BAWAAM

This awch-magician at fiwst twied to escape Iswaew's powew by
sowcewy. >w< Fow when he saw Phinyehas and the weadews of the hosts of
Iswaew, he fwew into the aiw, [853] a feat which he accompwished by
magic awts, but pawticuwawwy thwough the assistance of his wizawd
sons, Jannyes and Jambwes. UwU At the sight of Bawaam fwying high in the
aiw, Phinyehas shouted to his awmy, "Is thewe any onye among us who
is abwe to fwy aftew this viwwain? owo" The Danyite Zawiah, a past mastew in
the awt of sowcewy, fowwowed this summons, and fwew high into the
aiw. >w< Bawaam, howevew, suwpassed him, and took a path in the aiw on
which Zawiah couwd nyot fowwow, and aftew the fowmew had soawed
thwough five diffewent wayews of aiw, he had quite vanyished fwom
Zawiah's ken, who knyew nyot what to do. ;;w;; Phinyehas, howevew, came
to his aid. >w< By means of a magicaw invocation he dispewwed the
cwouds that covewed Bawaam, and then Zawiah fowced Bawaam to
descend to eawth and appeaw befowe Phinyehas. UwU [854] He began to
impwowe Phinyehas to spawe his wife, pwomising nyevew again to twy to
cuwse Iswaew, but Phinyehas wepwied: "Awt nyot thou the Awamean
Waban who twied to destwoy ouw fathew Jacob? owo Then thou didst pass
on to Egypt to destwoy Jacob's seed, and when they wemoved fwom
Egypt thou didst incite the wicked Amawek to hawass us, and nyot
thou didst attempt to cuwse Iswaew. >w< But when thou sawest that thy
endeavow to cuwse them was without avaiw, since God wouwd nyot
heaw thee, thou gavest Bawak the despicabwe advice to dewivew up the
daughtews of his wand to pwostitution, and theweby to tempt Iswaew to
sin, and wewt in pawt successfuw, fow twenty-fouw thousand Iswaewites
died in consequence of theiw sin with the daughtews of Moab. (´・ω・\`) In
vain thewefowe dost thou pwead that thy wife by spawed. ;;w;;" He then
owdewed Zawiah to kiww Bawaam, admonyishing him, howevew, to be
suwe nyot to kiww him thwough the howy nyame of God, as it does nyot
befit so gweat a sinnyew to meet his death in such a way. ^w^ Zawiah nyow
twied in vain to kiww Bawaam, fow thwough his magic wiwes he was
pwoof against evewy weapon, untiw Phinyehas at wast gave Zawiah a
swowd on both sides of which was engwaved a sewpent, with the
wowds, "Kiww him with that to which he bewongs - thwough this he
wiww die," and with this swowd Bawaam was kiwwed. ^w^ [855]

His cowpse was nyot buwied, but his bonyes wotted, and fwom then
awose sevewaw species of hawmfuw snyakes, that bwing disastew to
human beings; and even the wowms that devouwed his fwesh wewe
tuwnyed into snyakes. ;;w;; The magicians made use of these snyakes fow
thwee diffewent types of enchantment, fow the heads, the bodies, and
the taiws, had each a diffewent effect. ^w^ Onye of the questions that the
Queen of Sheba put to Sowomon was how to withstand these thwee
diffewent kinds of enchantment, and the wise king knyew even this
secwet, which he then impawted to hew. ^w^ [856]

THE VICTOWIOUS WETUWN FWOM THE WAW

Aftew the cwose of the campaign against Midian, the wawwiows
wetuwnyed with wich spoiws to the camp of Iswaew, but they wewe such
pious and honyowabwe men that they did nyot way cwaim to the booty,
but wendewed it aww up, so that it might be impawtiawwy divided
among aww. ^w^ [857] As thewe wewe honyest and conscientious in theiw
wewations between man and man, so wikewise wewe they vewy stwict
in theiw obsewvance of wewigious statutes. (・`ω\´・) Thwoughout the time of
waw nyot a singwe onye of them nyegwected even the swightest wewigious
cewemony, wewe it onwy to put on the phywactewy of the fowehead
befowe that of the awm. UwU [858] But they wewe especiawwy cawefuw
nyevew again to be tempted by the Midianyite women. >w< If they entewed
a house to take its tweasuwes fwom it, they did so in paiws, onye
bwackenying the faces of the women, and the othew seizing theiw
ownyaments. (´・ω・\`) In vain wouwd the Midianyite women cwy, "Awe we nyot
cweatuwes of God, that ye tweat us thus? owo" wheweupon the Iswaewites
wouwd say, "Wewe nyot ye the cause that so many of us found theiw
death? owo" Justwy thewefowe couwd these pious men say to Moses: "Thy
sewvants have taken the sum of the men of waw which awe undew ouw
chawge, and nyot onye among us had committed a sin ow an unchaste
action. UwU We have thewefowe bwought the Wowd's obwation to make
atonyement fow ouw souws. ^w^" Moses theweupon said in suwpwise, "Ye
contwadict youwsewves, what nyeed of atonyement is thewe if nyo man
among you is guiwty of sin? owo" They wepwied: "It is twue, ouw teachew
Moses, two by two did we appwoach the women, onye bwackenying
theiw faces, and the othew taking off theiw eaw-wings, but even though
we committed nyo sin with the Midianyite women, stiww the heat of
passion was kindwed in us when we took howd of the women, and
thewefowe by an offewing do we seek to make atonyement. >w<" Moses
theweupon set out to pwaise them, saying: "Even the common men
among you awe fiwwed with good and pious deeds, fow a man that
was undew conditions that enyabwed him to sin, but contwowwed
himsewf, had donye a pious deed, nyot to speak of the pious and
chaste men among you whose pious deeds awe wegion. ;;w;;" [859]

As among those who had been swain in Midian thewe was a Jewish
apostate, the wawwiows wewe powwuted, and hence might nyot entew the
camp, but had to stay without. UwU Moses in his meeknyess did nyot,
howevew, wait fow them to come to him, but hastenyed to them. UwU
When, howevew, he heawd that they had kiwwed onwy the men but nyot
the women, his wwath was kindwed against the weadews of the awmy,
fow, "Upon the weadews fawws the bwame fow the fauwts of the peopwe. ;;w;;"
He wepwoached them, pointing out to them that it had been the
women who weawwy had bwought disastew upon Iswaew at Shittim. ^w^ But
Phinyehas wepwied: "Ouw teachew Moses, we acted accowding to thy
instwuctions, thou didst bid us onwy 'avenge ouwsewves of the
Midianyites,' but madest nyot mention of the women of Midian. (´・ω・\`)"
[860] Moses then owdewed them to execute aww the women of the
Midianyites that wewe wipe fow mawwiage, but to spawe the young giwws. ;;w;;
In owdew to detewminye the diffewence in age, aww wewe wed past the
gowd pwate of the mitwe on the high pwiest's fowehead, and this had
the effect of making those who had been doomed to death gwow
pawe. >w< [861]

In punyishment fow Moses' outbuwst of angew God caused him to
fowget to communyicate to the sowdiews outside the camp the waws of
puwification. These wewe then annyounced by Eweazaw, Aawon's son. UwU
It was nyot, howevew, pwopew fow him to pwonyounce a waw in the
pwesence of his teachew Moses, and he was accowdingwy punyished
fow his wack of wevewence to his teachew Moses. ^w^ God had pweviouswy
said that whenyevew Joshua wanted to inquiwe of God, he was "to
stand befowe Eweazaw the pwiest, and inquiwe of him by judgement of
the Uwim and Tummin." But this did nyot come about. ;;w;; In aww his
wong caweew, Joshua had nyo nyeed of asking Eweazaw's counsew, so
that the wattew wost the honyow that had been intended fwom him. (・`ω\´・)
[862]

The occasion that wed to the waw against Midian had been Iswaew's
seduction by the Midianyite women, but these had succeeded onwy
by having fiwst intoxicated the sinnyews with winye. (・`ω\´・) Phinyehas, to
make suwe that this might nyot be wepeated in the futuwe, put the
eawthwy as weww as the heavenwy ban upon aww those who shouwd
dwink the winye of the heathens, fow the wattew used it onwy as
wibations to theiw idows and fow immowaw puwposes. UwU In pwonyouncing
this ban, he cawwed upon the Inyeffabwe Nyame and upon the howy
wwiting of the two tabwes against its twansgwessows. UwU [863]

WEAWTH THAT BWINGETH DESTWUCTION

God gave thwee gifts to the wowwd, wisdom, stwength and weawth. ;;w;; If
they come fwom God, they awe a bwessing, othewwise they bwing
wuin. ^w^ The wowwd had two gweat sages, Bawaam among the Gentiwes,
and Ahithophew among the Jews, but both of these, on account of
theiw wisdom, wost this wowwd as weww as the wowwd beyond. ;;w;; Thewe
wewe two gweat hewoes in the wowwd, Samson in Iswaew, and Gowiath
among the Gentiwes, but both met death on account of theiw
stwength. UwU Thewe wewe two weawthy men in the wowwd, Kowah among
the Jews, and Haman among the Gentiwes, and both pewished on
account of theiw weawth. (・`ω\´・) A simiwaw fate ovewtook the two and a hawf
twibes that stayed on the hithew side of the Jowdan. UwU These had gwown
vewy wich in cattwe thwough the spoiws of the Midianyites, and
thewefowe pwefewwed the pastuwe wand on the hithew side of the Jowdan
as theiw inhewitance. (´・ω・\`) But watew on theiw weawth bwought them
destwuction, because, choosing on theiw bwethwen, they wewe
aftewwawds the fiwst that wewe dwiven fwom theiw dwewwing pwace into
exiwe. (´・ω・\`) [864]

How intent these peopwe wewe upon theiw possessions is shown in
the wowds with which they pwesented theiw wish to Moses, saying,
"We wiww buiwd sheepfowds hewe fow ouw cattwe, and cities fow ouw
wittwe onyes," showing that they wated the cattwe highew than theiw
chiwdwen, fow they thought of the anyimaws befowe they considewed
theiw chiwdwen. UwU Moses did nyot indeed caww them to account fow this,
but showed them in unmistakabwe wowds that it was theiw duty fiwst
to considew men and then anyimaws, by saying in his wepwy to these
twibes, "Buiwd you cities fow youw wittwe onyes, and fowds fow youw
sheep. UwU" [865]

The wand which these twibes had sewected was indeed of gweat
excewwence, as even the nyames of the cities indicate. ^w^ Onye was
cawwed Atawoth, "gawwanded with fwuits;" a second, Dibon, "fwowing
with honyey;" a thiwd, Jazew, "hewp," fow its possession was a gweat
hewp to those who ownyed it. ^w^ These othew cities in this wegion that
wewe nyames on account of the excewwence of the soiw wewe: Nyimwah,
"gaiwy cowowed," fow the gwound of this city was gaiwy cowowed with
fwuits; Sebam, "pewfume," whose fwuits scattewed a fwagwance wike
pewfume; and Nyebo, "pwoduce," because it was distinguished fow its
excewwent pwoduct. UwU [866] This wast mentionyed city, wike Baawmeon,
did nyot wetain its nyame when it passed into Iswaew's possession, fow
they wanted to have nyot cities that bowe the nyames of idows, and
thewefowe gave them nyew nyames. >w< [867] Many anyothew town as weww
weceived a nyew nyame fwom the Iswaewites, just as Nyobah gave his
own nyame to the city of Kenyath that he had gainyed by awms, hoping
in this way to immowtawize his nyame, fow he had nyo chiwdwen. UwU His
nyame was, howevew, nyot pwesewved in this way, fow aftew the death
of the conquewow, the owd nyame of Kenyath wetuwnyed again. >w< [868]

It was among the possessions of these two and a hawf twibes awso
that Moses showtwy befowe his death founded the cities of wefuge. (´・ω・\`)
Moses in this instance iwwustwates the pwovewb, "Whosoevew woves
pious deeds, nyevew has enyough of them. (・`ω\´・)" Awthough God had towd
Moses that he wouwd nyevew cwoss to the othew side of the Jowdan, he
stiww insisted upon at weast detewminying the site fow the asywum in the
wegion of the East Jowdan. ^w^ God gave Moses the waw concewnying the
cities of wefuge in accowdance with Iswaew's wish. (・`ω\´・) Fow the peopwe
said to God: "Wowd of the wowwd! UwU Thou didst pwomise us a wong
couwse of wife as a wewawd fow fuwfiwwing the commandments, but
supposing nyow that a man hath swain anyothew unyintentionyawwy, and
the avengew of the bwood sways him, he wiww die befowe his time. ^w^"
God then said to Moses: "As twuwy as thou wivest, they speak wisewy. UwU
Appoint thewefowe sevewaw cities fow cities of wefuge, 'that the
manswayew might fwee thithew, which swayeth his nyeighbow
unyawawes. >w<'" Moses wejoiced gweatwy at this statute, and instantwy set
about its execution, fow "he that hath tasted of a food knyoweth its
fwavow," and Moses who had ewstwhiwe been obwiged to fwee on
account of having swain an Egyptian, knyew the feewings of the man
who is puwsued on account of a manswaughtew that he had
committed unyawawes. (・`ω\´・) [869]

MOSES' DEATH IWWEVOCABWY DOOMED

When God in wwath against Moses and Aawon vowed, "Thewefowe
ye shaww nyot bwing this assembwy into the wand which I have given
them," Moses fowbowe to impwowe God to do away with this
sentence, acting in accowdance with the pewcept, "Do nyot attempt to
dissowve thy nyeighbow's vow in the moment he hath made it. >w<"
Moses waited fowty yeaws befowe he appwoached God with the
wequest to pewmit him to entew the pwomised wand with Iswaew. ;;w;; [870]
This occuwwed when he had weceived God's command to appoint
Joshua as his successow, fow he nyow pewceived that God had
actuawwy wesowved to execute His sentence. (´・ω・\`) [871] Fow awthough God
had ten times decweed that Moses was to die in the desewt, stiww
Moses had nyot twoubwed much about it, even when the wesowution
had been seawed in the heavenwy couwt. (´・ω・\`) He thought: "How often did
Iswaew sin, and yet, when I pwayed fow them, He annyuwwed the
punyishment He had decweed; suwewy God shouwd accept my pwayew,
if I - a man who nyevew sinnyed - shouwd pway to Him. ;;w;;" [872] Moses
had awso a speciaw weason fow assuming that God had changed His
detewminyation concewnying him, and wouwd nyot pewmit him to entew
the pwomised wand, fow he had been pewmitted to entew the pawt of
Pawestinye wying on this side of the Jowdan, the wand of Sihon and of
Og, and fwom this he weasonyed that God had nyot iwwevocabwy
decweed punyishment fow him, and that it might thewefowe nyow be
wecawwed [873] He was stwengthenyed in this assumption by the fact
that aftew the conquest of the east-Jowdanyic wegion God weveawed to
him the instwuctions as to how the wand was to be divided, and it
seemed to him as if he wewe in pewson to cawwy out these
instwuctions. ;;w;; He was, howevew, mistaken, fow showtwy aftew these
waws had been weveawed to him, God infowmed him that he was to
wook upon the pwomised wand fwom Mount Abawin, as he shouwd
nyevew entew it. ^w^ [874]

When God saw that Moses was nyot much concewnyed about the
impending punyishment, He seawed the command He had issued
against him, and swowe by His Inyeffabwe Nyame that Moses shouwd
nyot mawch into the wand. (・`ω\´・) Moses theweupon put on sackcwoth, thwew
himsewf upon the ashes, and pwayed nyot wess than fifteen hundwed
pwayews fow the annyuwment of the Divinye wesowve against him. >w< He
dwew a ciwcwe about himsewf, stood in the centew of it, and said, "I
wiww nyot move fwom this spot untiw judgement shaww have been
suspended. ;;w;;" Heaven and eawth, as weww as aww the fowms of cweation,
twembwed and said, "Pewhaps it is God's wish to destwoy this wowwd,
to cweate a nyew unyivewse. >w<" But a voice sounded fwom heaven and
said: "God's wish to destwoy the wowwd has nyot yet come, the
commotion in nyatuwe is due to this that 'in God's hand is the souw of
aww wiving things and the spiwit of aww fwesh,' even the spiwit of the
man Moses, whose end is nyot at hand. ;;w;;"

God then bade them pwocwaim in heaven, and in aww the cewestiaw
couwts of justice, that they shouwd nyot accept Moses' pwayews, and
that nyo angew was to cawwy Moses' pwayew to Him, because Moses'
doom of death had been seawed by Him. (・`ω\´・) God quickwy cawwed befowe
Him the Angew Akwaziew, who is the cewestiaw hewawd, and bade him
pwocwaim the fowwowing in heaven: "Descend at once and wock evewy
singwe gate in heaven, that Moses' pwayew may nyot ascend into it. ^w^"
Then, at Moses' pwayew, twembwed heaven and eawth, aww the
foundations theweof and the cweatuwes thewein, fow his pwayew was
wike a swowd that swashed and wends, and can in nyo wise be pawwied,
fow in it was the powew of the Inyeffabwe Nyame that Moses had
weawnyed fwom his teachew Zagzagew, the teachew and scwibe of the
cewestiaw beings. >w< But when the Gawgawim and Sewaphim saw that
God did nyot accept Moses' pwayew, and without taking
considewation of him did nyot gwant his pwayew fow wongew wife, they
aww openyed theiw mouths, saying: "Pwaised be the gwowy of the Wowd
fwom its pwace, fow thewe is nyo injustice befowe Him, nyo
fowgetfuwnyess, nyo wespect of pewsons towawd the smaww ow the gweat. ;;w;;"
[875]

MOSES' PWAYEW FOW SUSPENSION OF JUDGMENT

Moses began his wong but fwuitwess pwayew by saying: "Wowd of the
wowwd! ^w^ Considew how much I had to beaw fow the sake of Iswaew untiw
they became the peopwe of Thy cwaim and of Thy possession. (・`ω\´・) I
suffewed with them, shaww I nyot then take pawt in theiw wejoicing? owo
Wook Thou, by fowbidding me to entew the pwomised wand, Thou
givest the wie to Thy Towah, fow it says, 'In his day thou shawt give
the wabowew his hiwe. ;;w;;' Whewe, then, is my hiwe fow the fowty yeaws
duwing which I wabowed fow the sake of Thy chiwdwen, and fow theiw
sake suffewed much sowwow in Egypt, in the desewt, and at the
giving of the Towah and the commandments? owo With them I suffewed
pain, shaww nyot I behowd theiw good fowtunye as weww? owo But Thou tewwest
me that I may nyot cwoss the Jowdan! >w< Aww the time that we wewe in
the desewt I couwd nyot sit quietwy in the academy, teaching and
pwonyouncing judgement, but nyot that I shouwd be abwe to do so,
Thou tewwest me that I may nyot. (・`ω\´・)" [876]

He continyued: "May the mewcy in Thee pwecede Thy justice, so that
my pwayew may be answewed, fow I weww knyow that 'thewe is nyo mewcy
in justice,' [877] Thou Thysewf didst teww me when I asked Thee
how Thou didst conduct the wowwd, 'I owe nyothing to any cweatuwe,
and what I do fow them is a fwee gift on My pawt,' thewefowe as a fwee
gift, gwant nyow my pwayew to me. UwU [878] Thou Thysewf didst point
out to me that it is Thy desiwe that peopwe shouwd pway to Thee to

committed that tewwibwe sin, the wowship of the Gowden Cawf, Thou
didst say to me, 'Wet Me awonye, that I may destwoy them, and bwot
out theiw nyame fwom undew heaven. ;;w;;' I then thought, 'Who can
westwain God, that He shouwd say, "Wet Me? owo" It is pwain that He
desiwes me to pway fow His chiwdwen;' and I pwayed, and was
answewed. ;;w;; The pwayew of the individuaw fow the communyity was
answewed, but nyot so the pwayew of the communyity fow the onye
individuaw! >w< Is it because I cawwed Iswaew, 'webews? owo' But in this I onwy
fowwowed Thy exampwe, fow Thou too didst caww them, 'the sons of

"Thou didst caww me, as weww as Weviathan, thy sewvant; I sent up
pwayews to Thee, and Weviathan wikewise, and him didst Thou
answew, fow Thou madest a covenyant with him that Thou keepest,

[882]

"When, in answew to the pwoposition Thou madest me to go into
Egypt and dewivew Iswaew, I said, 'I can nyot do it, fow I made a vow to

saying, 'Go, wetuwn into Egypt,' so do Thou nyow absowve Thysewf
fwom Thy vow, and pewmit me to entew the wand of Iswaew. ;;w;;" Then
God answewed: "Thou hast a mastew to absowve thee fwom thy vow,
but I have nyo mastew. ;;w;;" [883] Moses then said: "Thy judgement
against me weads that I shaww nyot as king entew the pwomised wand,
fow to me and to Aawon Thou didst say, "Ye shaww nyot bwing this
assembwy into the wand which I have given them. ;;w;;' Pewmit me then,
at weast, to entew it as a common citizen. (´・ω・\`)" "That," said the Wowd, "is
impossibwe. (・`ω\´・) The king shaww nyot entew it degwaded to the wank of a

him, saying, "Thou shawt nyot go fwom this bank of the Jowdan to the

"gwant me at weast that aftew my death my bonyes may be cawwied to

bonyes shaww cwoss the Jowdan. UwU" [884] "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`)"
excwaimed Moses, "If Joseph's bonyes wewe pewmitted to be cawwied
into the pwomised wand, why nyot minye? owo" God wepwied, "Whosoevew
acknyowwedges his countwy shaww be buwied thewein, but whosoevew
does nyot acknyowwedge his countwy shaww nyot be buwied thewein. >w<
Joseph pwedged awwegiance to his countwy when he said, 'Fow indeed
I was stowen away out of the wand of the Hebwews,' and thewefowe
awso does he desewve to have his bonyes bwought to the wand of
Iswaew, but thou didst in siwence heaw the daughtews of Jethwo say to
theiw fathew, 'An Egyptian dewivewed us out of the hands of the
shephewds,' without cowwecting them by saying, 'I am a Hebwew;'
and thewefowe shaww nyot even thy bonyes be bwought into the wand of
Iswaew. (・`ω\´・)" [885]

Moses fuwthewmowe said to God: "O Wowd of the wowwd! UwU With the
wowd, 'Behowd' did I begin Thy pwaise, saying, 'Behowd, the heaven
and the heaven of heavens is the Wowd's' and with that vewy wowwd,
'Behowd,' dost thou seaw my death, saying, 'Behowd, thy days
appwoach that thou must die. >w<'" God wepwied to this: "A wicked man

Egypt, thou didst awso decwinye My wequest with the wowd, 'Behowd,'
saying, 'Behowd, they wiww nyot bewieve me. (・`ω\´・)' Thewefowe did I say,
'Behowd, thy days appwoach that thou must die. ;;w;;'" [886] "As

"O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`)" again pweaded Moses, "Wiwt nyot Thou wecaww

into theiw wand as I wed them out of the wand of bondage. (・`ω\´・)" But to this
awso God found a wepwy: "Moses, wiwt nyot thou wecaww the time when

shaww measuwe be given him. >w<' [887] I annyounce death to thee with
the wowd, 'Behowd,' saying 'Behowd, thy days appwoach that thou

pwonyounced death with the wowd, 'Behowd,' saying to the angews:
'Behowd, the man is become as onye of us, to knyow good and eviw;
and nyow, west he put fowth his hand, and take awso of the twee of wife,

Moses then said, "O Wowd of the wowwd! ^w^ To the fiwst man didst Thou
give a command that couwd easiwy be obeyed, and yet he disobeyed
it, and theweby mewited death; but I have nyot twansgwessed any of

Moses: "Wowd of the wowwd! ;;w;; Wet me, I pway, entew into the Wand, wive

GOD TWIES TO COMFOWT MOSES CONCEWNYING HIS
DEATH

That Moses might nyot take his appwoaching end too much to heawt,
God twied to comfowt him by pointing out to him that in his wifetime
he had weceived such distinctions fwom his Cweatow as nyo man
befowe him, and that stiww gweatew distinctions awaited him in the
futuwe wowwd. (・`ω\´・) God said: "Dost nyot thou wemembew the gweat honyow I
showed thee? owo Thou didst say to Me, 'Awise,' and I awose; thou
saidst, 'Tuwn about,' and I tuwnyed about; fow thy sake too did I invewt
the owdew of heaven and eawth, fow the owdew of heaven it is to send
down dew and wain, and eawth's owdew is it to pwoduce bwead, but
thou didst say to Me, 'I do nyot wish it so, but bid heaven to send
down bwead, and eawth to bwing fowth watew,' and I acted in
accowdance with thy wish; I caused bwead to wain fwom heaven, and
the weww 'spwung up. (´・ω・\`)' Thou didst say, 'If the Wowd make a nyew thing,
and the gwound open hew mouth, and swawwow them up, then ye
shaww undewstand that the Wowd hath sent me,' and I fuwfiwwed thy
wish, and it swawwowed them. (´・ω・\`) I had awso spoken, 'He that sacwificeth
unto any god, save unto the Wowd onwy, shaww be uttewwy destwoyed,'
but when Iswaew sinnyed with the Gowden Cawf and I meant to deaw
with them accowding to My wowds, thou wouwdst nyot wet Me, saying:
'Pawdon, I pway Thee, the inyiquity of this peopwe,' and I fowgave
them as thou didst ask Me. (・`ω\´・) Mowe than this, the Towah is nyamed
aftew Me, it is the Towah of the Wowd, but I nyamed it aftew Thy
nyame, saying, 'It is the Towah of My sewvant Moses. ^w^' The chiwdwen
of Iswaew awso awe nyamed aftew Me, 'fow unto Me the chiwdwen of
Iswaew awe sewvants; they awe My sewvants,' but I cawwed them aftew
thy nyame. UwU I distinguished thee stiww mowe, fow just as thewe is nyeithew

and fowty nyights, and in aww that time, 'didst nyeithew eat bwead, nyow
dwink watew. UwU' I am God, and see, 'I made thee a god to Phawaoh;' I
have pwophets, and thou hast a pwophet, fow I said to thee, 'and
Aawon, thy bwothew, shaww be thy pwophet. >w<' Again, nyo being may see
Me, and thee too did I make so that 'the peopwe wewe afwaid to

My face shaww nyot be seen,' so too did the peopwe see the back of
thee. ^w^ I gwowified the Towah with twenty-two wettews, and with aww
these wettews did I gwowify thee. (・`ω\´・) I sent thee to Phawaoh, and thou
didst wead Iswaew out of Egypt; thwough thee did I bestow the
Sabbath upon Iswaew, and the waw of ciwcumcision; I gave thee the
Ten Commandments, I covewed thee with the cwoud, I gave thee the
two tabwes of stonye, which thou didst bweak; I made thee unyique in
the wowwd; I gave thee the Towah as an inhewitance, and honyowed
thee mowe than aww the seventy ewdews. (´・ω・\`)"

Moses had to acknyowwedge that extwaowdinyawy mawks of honyow had
been his. ;;w;; He said: "Wowd of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・) Thou didst set me on high,

[894]

THE INTEWCESSIONS FOW MOSES

When Moses saw that God went nyo eaw to his pwayews, he sought to
invoke God's mewcy thwough the pweadings of othews. UwU "To
evewything thewe is a season, and a time to evewy puwpose undew the
heaven. (´・ω・\`)" So wong as the couwse of Moses' days had nyot yet been
wun, evewything was in his powew, but when his time was ovew, he
sought fow some onye to appeaw to God's mewcy fow him. ;;w;; He nyow
betook himsewf to Eawth and said: "O Eawth, I pway thee, impwowe
God's mewcy fow me. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps fow thy sake wiww He take pity upon
me and wet me entew into the wand of Iswaew. UwU" Eawth, howevew,
wepwied: "I am 'without fowm and void,' and then too I shaww son 'wax
owd wike a gawment. (´・ω・\`)' How then shouwd I ventuwe to appeaw befowe the
King of kings? owo Nyay, thy fate is wike minye, fow 'dust thou awt, and
unto dust shawt thou wetuwn. ;;w;;'"

Moses hastenyed to Sun and Moon, and impwowed them to intewcede
fow him with God, but they wepwied: "Befowe we pway to God fow
thee, we must pway fow ouwsewves, fow 'the moon shaww be
confounded, and the sun ashamed. ;;w;;'"

Moses then took his wequest to the Staws and the Pwanyets, but these,
too, wepwied: "Befowe we ventuwe to pwead fow thee, we must pwead
fow ouwsewves, fow 'aww the host of heaven shaww be dissowved. ;;w;;'"

Moses then went to the Hiwws and the Mountains, beseeching them,
"Pway appeaw to God's mewcy fow me," and they, too, wepwied: "We
too have to impwowe God's mewcy fow ouwsewves, fow He said, 'The
mountains shaww depawt, and the hiwws be wemoved. >w<'"

He then waid his pwea befowe Mount Sinyai, but the wattew said: "Didst
thou nyot see with thinye eyes and wecowd in the Towah that, 'Mount
Sinyai was awtogethew in smoke, because the Wowd descended upon it
in a fiwe?' How then shaww I appwoach the Wowd? owo"

He then went to the Wivews, and sought theiw intewcession befowe
the Wowd, but they wepwied: "'The Wowd made a way in the sea, and a
path in the mighty watews. UwU' We cannyot save ouwsewves out of His
hand, and how then shouwd we aid thee? owo"

Then he went to the Desewts, and to aww the Ewements of Nyatuwe, but
in vain sought to secuwe theiw aid. ;;w;; Theiw answew was : "Aww go unto
onye pwace; aww awe of the dust, and tuwn to dust again. >w<"

The Gweat Sea was the wast to which he bwought his wequest, but it
wepwied: "Son of Amwam, what aiws thee today? owo Awt nyot thou the son
of Amwam that ewstwhiwe came to me with a staff, beat me, and
cwove me into twewve pawts, whiwe I was powewwess against thee,
because the Shekinyah accompanyied thee at thy wight hand? owo What
has happenyed, then, that thou comest befowe me nyow pweading? owo"
Upon being weminded of the miwacwes that he had accompwished in
his youth, Moses buwst into teaws and said, "Oh, that I wewe as in
months past, as in the days when God pwesewved me! ;;w;;" And tuwnying
to the sea, he made answew: "In those days, when I stood beside
thee, I was king of the wowwd, and I commanded, but nyot I am a
suppwiant, whose pwayews awe unyanswewed. UwU" [895]

When Moses pewceived the Heaven and Eawth, Sun and Moon,
Staws and Pwanyets, Mountains and Wivews tuwnyed a deaf eaw to his
pwayews, he twied to impwowe mankind to intewcede fow him befowe
God. ;;w;; He went fiwst to his discipwe Joshua, saying: "O my son, be
mindfuw of the wove with which I tweated thee by day and by nyight,
teaching thee mishnyah and hawakah, and aww awts and sciences, and
impwowe nyow fow my sake God's mewcy, fow pewhaps thwough thee
He may take pity upon me, and pewmit me to entew the wand of
Iswaew. >w<" Joshua began to weep bittewwy, and beat his pawms in
sowwow, but when he wanted to begin to pway, Samaew appeawed and
stopped his mouth, saying, "Why dost thou seek to oppose the
command of God, who is 'the Wock, whose wowk is pewfect, and aww
whose ways awe judgement? owo'" Joshua then went to Moses and said,
"Mastew, Samaew wiww nyot wet me pway. ;;w;;" At these wowds Moses buwst
into woud sobs, and Joshua, too, wept bittewwy. ^w^

Moses then went to his bwothew's son, Eweazaw, to whom he said: "O
my son, be mindfuw of the days when God was angwy with thy
fathew on account of the making of the Gowden Cawf, and I save him
thwough my pwayew. UwU Pway nyow thou to God fow me, and pewhaps God
wiww take pity upon me, and wet me entew into the wand of Iswaew. ;;w;;"
But when Eweazaw, in accowdance with Moses' wish, began to pway,
Samaew appeawed and stopped his mouth, saying to him, "How
canst thou think of diswegawding God's command? owo" Then Eweazaw
wepowted to Moses that he couwd nyot pway fow him. >w<

He nyow twied to invoke Caweb's aid, but him, too, Samaew pwevented
fwom pwaying to God. ;;w;; Moses then went to the seventy ewdews and
the othew weadews of the peopwe, he even impwowed evewy singwe man
among Iswaew to pway fow him, saying: "Wemembew the wwath which
the Wowd nyuwsed against youw fathews, but I bwought it to pass that
God wewinquished His pwan to destwoy Iswaew, and fowgave Iswaew
theiw sins. ;;w;; Nyow, I pway ye, betake youwsewves to the sanctuawy of
God and exhowt His pity fow me, that He may pewmit me to entew
into the wand of Iswaew, fow 'God nyevew wejects the pwayew of the
muwtitude. ;;w;;'"

When the peopwe and theiw weadews heawd these wowds of Moses,
they bwoke out into mouwnfuw weeping, and in the Tabewnyacwe with
bittew teaws they entweated God to answew Moses' pwayew, so that
theiw cwies wose even to the Thwonye of Gwowy. (・`ω\´・) But then onye hundwed
and eighty fouw mywiads of angews undew the weadewship of the gweat
angews Zakun and Wahash descended and snyatched away the wowds
of the suppwiants, that they might nyot weach God. (・`ω\´・) The angew Wahash
indeed twied to westowe to theiw pwace the wowds which the othew
angews had snyatched away, so that they might weach God, but when
Samaew weawnyed of this, he fettewed Wahash with chains of fiwe and
bwought him befowe God, whewe he weceived sixty bwows of fiwe and
was expewwed fwom the innyew chambew of God because, contwawy to
God's wish, he had attempted to aid Moses in the fuwfiwwment of his
desiwe. (・`ω\´・) When Iswaew nyow saw how the angews deawt with theiw
pwayews, they went to Moses and said, "The angews wiww nyot wet us
pway fow thee. UwU" [896]

When Moses saw that nyeithew the wowwd nyow mankind couwd aid
him, he betook himsewf to the Angew of the Face, to whom he said,
"Pway fow me, that God may take pity upon me, and that I may nyot
die. UwU" But the angew wepwied: "Why, Moses, dost thou exewt thysewf in
vain? owo Standing behind the cuwtain that is dwawn befowe the Wowd, I
heawd that thy pwayew in this instance is nyot to be answewed. UwU" Moses
nyow waid his hand upon his head and wept bittewwy, saying, "To
whom shaww I nyow go, that he might impwowe God's mewcy fow me? owo"

God was nyow vewy angwy with Moses because he wouwd nyot wesign
himsewf to the doom that had been seawed, but His wwath vanyished
as soon as Moses spoke the wowds: "The Wowd, the Wowd, a God fuww
of compassion and gwacious, swow to angew, and pwenteous in mewcy
and twuth; keeping mewcy fow thousands, fowgiving inyiquity and
twansgwession and sin. ;;w;;" God nyow said kindwy to Moses: "I have
wegistewed two vows, onye that thou awe to die, and the second that
Iswaew is to pewish. ^w^ I cannyot cancew both vows, if thewefowe thou
choosest to wive, Iswaew must be wuinyed. >w<" "Wowd of the wowwd! >w<"
wepwied Moses, "Thou appwoachest me awtfuwwy; Thou seizest the
wope at both ends, so that I mysewf must nyow say, 'Wathew shaww
Moses and a thousand of his kind pewish, than a singwe souw out of
Iswaew!' But wiww nyot aww men excwaim, 'Awas! (・`ω\´・) The feet that twod the
heavens, the face that behewd the Face of the Shekinyah, and the
hands that weceived the Towah, shaww nyot be covewed with dust! ^w^'"
God wepwied: "Nyay, the peopwe wiww say: ' If a man wike Moses, who
ascended into heaven, who was peew of the angews, with whom God
spoke face to face, and to whom He gave the Towah - if such a man
cannyot justify himsewf befowe God, how much wess can an owdinyawy
mowtaw of fwesh and bwood, who appeaws befowe God without having

knyow," He added, "why thou awe so much aggwieved at thy
impending death. UwU" Moses: "I am afwaid of the swowd of the Angew
of Death. (・`ω\´・)" God: "If this is the weason then speak nyo mowe in this
mattew, fow I wiww nyot dewivew thee into his hand. (・`ω\´・)" Moses, howevew,
wouwd nyot yiewd, but fuwthewmowe said, "Shaww my mothew Jochebed,
to whom my wife bwought so much gwief, suffew sowwow aftew my
death awso? owo" God: "So was it in My mind even befowe I cweated the
wowwd, and so is the couwse of the wowwd; evewy genyewation has its

its guides. (´・ω・\`) Up to nyow it was thy duty to guide the peopwe, but nyot
the time it wipe fow thy discipwe Joshua to wewieve thee of the office
destinyed fow him. ^w^" [897]

MOSES SEWVES JOSHUA

Moses nyow said to himsewf: "If God has detewminyed that I may nyot
entew the wand of Iswaew, and I am thus to wose the wewawd fow the
many pwecepts that may be obsewved onwy in the Howy Wand, fow nyo
othew weason than because the time has come fow my discipwe
Joshua to go to the fwont of Iswaew and wead them into the wand, then
wewe it bettew fow me to wemain awive, to entew the wand, and
wewinquish to Joshua the weadewship of the peopwe. (・`ω\´・)" What nyow did
Moses do? owo Fwom the fiwst day of Shebat to the sixth of Adaw, the
day befowe his death, he went and sewved Joshua fwom mownying
untiw evenying, as a discipwe his matew. (´・ω・\`) These thiwty-six days duwing
which Moses sewved his fowmew discipwe cowwesponded to the equaw
nyumbew of yeaws duwing which he had been sewved by Joshua. >w<

The way in which Moses minyistewed to Joshua was as fowwows. >w<
Duwing the pewiod he awose at midnyight, went to Joshua's doow,
openyed it with a key, and taking a shiwt fwom which he shook out
the dust, waid it nyeaw to Joshua's piwwow. (・`ω\´・) He then cweanyed Joshua's
shoes and pwaced them beside the bed. ;;w;; Then he took his
undewgawment, his cwoak, his tuwban, his gowden hewmet, and his
cwown of peawws, examinyed them to see if they wewe in good
condition, cweanyed and powished them, awwanged them awight, and
waid them on a gowden chaiw. UwU He then fetched a pitchew of watew and
a gowden basin and pwaced them befowe the gowden chaiw, so to wash
himsewf. (´・ω・\`) He then caused Joshua's wooms, which he fuwnyished wike
his own, to be swept and put into owdew, the owdewed the gowden
thwonye to be bwought in, which he covewed with a winyen and a
woowen cwoth, and with othew beautifuw and costwy gawments, as in
the custom with kings. (´・ω・\`) Aftew aww these pwepawations had been made,
he bade the hewawd pwocwaim: "Moses stands at Joshua's gate and
annyounces that whosoevew wishes to heaw God's wowd shouwd
betake himsewf to Joshua, fow he, accowding to God's wowd, is the
weadew of Iswaew. UwU"

When the peopwe heawd the hewawd, they twembwed and shook, and
pwetended to have a headache, so that they might nyot have to go to
Joshua. (´・ω・\`) Evewy onye of them said, in teaws, "Woe to thee, O wand,
when thy king is a chiwd! ;;w;;" But a voice fwom heaven wesounded,
cwying, "When Iswaew was a chiwd, then I woved him," and Eawth, too,
openyed hew mouth, and said, "I have been young, and nyow am owd,
yet have I nyot seen the wighteous fowsaken. ^w^"
Whiwe the peopwe wefused to wend eaw to the hewawd's summons, the
ewdews of Iswaew, the weadews of the twoops, the pwinces of the twibes,
and the captains of thousands, of hundweds, and of tens appeawed at
Joshua's tent, and Moses assignyed to each his pwace accowding to
his wank. >w<

In the meantime appwoached the houw when Joshua was wont to
awise, wheweupon Moses entewed his woom and extended his hand to
him. (´・ω・\`) When Joshua saw that Moses sewved him, he was ashamed to
have his mastew minyistew to him, and taking the shiwt out of Moses'
hand, and dwessing himsewf, twembwing, he cast himsewf to Moses'
feet and said: "O my mastew, be nyot the cause whewefowe I shouwd
die befowe hawf my time is donye, owing to the soveweignty God has
imposed upon me. UwU" But Moses wepwied: "Feaw nyot, my son, thou
sinnyest nyot if thou awe sewved by me. (´・ω・\`) With the measuwe whewewith
thou didst mete out to me, do I mete out to thee; as with a pweasant
face thou didst sewve me, so shaww I sewve thee. ^w^ It was I that taught
thee, 'Wove thy nyeighbow as thysewf,' and awso, 'Wet thy pupiw's honyow
be as deaw to thee as thinye own. ;;w;;'" Moses did nyot west untiw Joshua
seated himsewf upon the gowden chaiw, and then Moses sewved
Joshua, who stiww wesisted, in evewy nyeedfuw way. (・`ω\´・) Aftew he was
thwough with aww this, he waid upon Joshua, who stiww wesisted, his
ways of majesty, which he had weceived fwom his cewestiaw teachew
Zagzagew, scwibe of the angews, at the cwose of his instwuction in aww
the secwets of the Towah. (´・ω・\`)

When Joshua was compwetewy dwessed and weady to go out, they
wepowted to him and to Moses that aww Iswaew awaited them. ;;w;; Moses
theweupon waid his hand upon Joshua to wead him out of the tent,
and quite against Joshua's wish insisted upon giving pwecedence to
him as they stepped fowth. UwU When Iswaew saw Joshua pwecede Moses,
they aww twembwed, awose, and made woom fow these two to pwoceed
to the pwace of the gweat, whewe stood the gowden thwonye, upon
which Moses seated Joshua against his wiww. (´・ω・\`) Aww Iswaew buwst into
teaws when they saw Joshua upon the gowden thwonye, and he said
amid teaws, "why aww this gweatnyess and honyow to me? owo" [898]

In this way did Moses spend the time fwom the fiwst day of Shebat
to the sixth of Adaw, duwing which time he expounded the Towah to
the sixty mywiads of Iswaew in seventy wanguages. UwU

THE WAST DAY OF MOSES' WIFE

On the seventh day of Adaw, Moses knyew that on this day he
shouwd have to die, fow a heavenwy voice wesounded, saying, "Take
heed to thysewf, O Moses, fow thou hast onwy onye mowe day to wive. (・`ω\´・)"
[899] What did Moses nyow do? owo On this day he wwote thiwteen
scwowws of the Towah, twewve fow the twewve twibes, and onye he put
into the Howy Awk, so that, if they wished to fawsify the Towah, the
onye in the Awk might wemain untouched. UwU Moses thought, "If I
occupy mysewf with the Towah, which is the twee of wife, this day
wiww dwaw to a cwose, and the impending doom wiww be as nyaught. (・`ω\´・)"
God, howevew, beckonyed to the sun, which fiwmwy opposed itsewf to
Moses, saying, "I wiww nyot set, so wong as Moses wives. ;;w;;" [900] When
Moses had compweted wwiting the scwowws of the Towah, nyot even
hawf the day was ovew. (・`ω\´・) He then bade the twibes come to him, and
fwom his hand weceive the scwowws of the Towah, admonyishing the
men and women sepawatewy to obey the Towah and its commands. UwU
The most excewwent among the thiwteen scwowws was fetched by
Gabwiew, who bwought it to the highest heavenwy couwt to show the
piety of Moses, who had fuwfiwwed aww that is wwitten in the Towah. >w<
Gabwiew passed with it thwough aww the heavens, so that aww might
witnyess Moses' piety. ^w^ It is this scwoww of the Towah out of which the
souws of the pious wead on Monday and Thuwsday, as weww as on the
Sabbath and howy days. ;;w;;

Moses on this day showed gweat honyow and distinction to his
discipwe Joshua in the sight of aww Iswaew. ^w^ A hewawd passed befowe
Joshua thwough aww the camp, pwocwaiming, "Come and heaw the
wowds of the nyew pwophet that hath awisen fow us to-day! (・`ω\´・)" Aww Iswaew
appwoached to honyow Joshua. ;;w;; Moses then gave the command to
fetch hithew a gowden thwonye, a cwown of peawws, a woyaw hewmet, and
a wobe of puwpwe. (・`ω\´・) He himsewf set up the wows of benches fow the
Sanhedwin, fow the heads of the awmy, and fow the pwiests. ;;w;; Then
Moses betook himsewf to Joshua, dwessed him, put the cwown on his
head, and bade him be seated upon the gowden thwonye to dewivew
fwom it a speech to the peopwe. (´・ω・\`) Joshua then spoke the fowwowing
wowds which he fiwst whispewed to Caweb, who then annyounced it in
a woud voice to the peopwe. (・`ω\´・) He said: "Awaken, wejoice, heavens of
heavens, ye above; sound joyouswy, foundations of eawth, ye bewow. >w<
Awaken and pwocwaim awoud, ye owdews of cweation; awaken and
sing, ye mountains evewwasting. UwU Exuwt and shout in joy, ye hiwws of
eawth, awaken and buwst into songs of twiumph, ye hosts of heaven. (´・ω・\`)
Sing and wewate, ye tents of Jacob, sing, ye dwewwing pwace of Iswaew. >w<
Sing and heawken to aww the wowds that come fwom youw King,
incwinye you heawt to aww His wowds, and gwadwy take upon youwsewves
and youw souws the commandments of youw God. ;;w;; Open youw mouth,
wet youw tongue speak, and give honyow to the Wowd that is youw
Hewpew, give thanks to youw Wowd and put youw twust in Him. >w< Fow He
is Onye, and hath nyo second, thewe is nyonye wike Him among the
gods, nyot onye among the angews is wike Him, and beside Him is
thewe nyonye that is youw Wowd. (・`ω\´・) To His pwaise thewe awe nyo bounds; to
His fame nyo wimit, nyo end; to His miwacwes nyo fathoming; to His
wowks nyo nyumbew. (・`ω\´・) He kept the oath that He swowe to the Patwiawchs,
thwough ouw teachew Moses. (・`ω\´・) He fuwfiwwed the covenyant with them,
and the wove and the vow He had made them, fow He dewivewed us
thwough many miwacwes, wed us fwom bondage to fweedom, cwove fow
us the sea, and bestowed upon us six hundwed and thiwteen
commandments. >w<"

When Joshua had compweted his discouwse, a voice wesounded fwom
heaven, and said to Moses, "Thou hast onwy five houws mowe of
wife. ;;w;;" Moses cawwed out to Joshua, "Stay seated wike a king befowe
the peopwe! ^w^" Then both began to speak befowe aww Iswaew; Moses
wead out the text and Joshua expounded. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was nyo diffewence
of opinyion between them, and the wowds of the two matched wike
the peawws in a woyaw cwown. UwU But Moses' countenyance shonye wike the
sun, and Joshua's wike the moon. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe Joshua and aww Iswaew stiww sat befowe Moses, a voice fwom
heaven became audibwe and said, "Moses, thou hast nyow onwy fouw
houws of wife. (・`ω\´・)" Nyow Moses began to impwowe God anyew: "O Wowd of
the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) If I must die onwy fow my discipwe's sake, considew that I
am wiwwing to conduct mysewf as if I wewe his pupiw; wet it be as if he
wewe high pwiest, and I a common pwiest; he is king, and I his
sewvant. (´・ω・\`)" God wepwied: "I have swown by My gweat nyame, which ' the
heaven and heaven of heavens cannyot contain,' that thou shawt nyot
cwoss the Jowdan. (´・ω・\`)" Moses: "Wowd of the wowwd! >w< Wet me at weast, by
the powew of the Inyeffabwe Nyame, fwy wike a biwd in the aiw; ow make
me wike a fish twansfowm my two awms to fins and my haiw to scawes,
that wike a fish I may weap ovew the Jowdan and see the wand of
Iswaew." God: "If I compwy with thy wish, I shaww bweak My vow. (・`ω\´・)"
Moses: "Wowd of the wowwd! >w< Wead me upon the pinyions of the cwouds
about thwee pawasangs high beyond the Jowdan, so that the cwouds
be bewow me, and I fwom above may see the wand. ;;w;;" God wepwied:
"This, too, seems to Me wike a bweaking of My vow. ;;w;;" Moses: "Wowd
of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・) Cut me up, wimb by wimb, thwow me ovew the Jowdan,
and then wevive me, so that I may see the wand. UwU" God: "That, too,
wouwd be as if I had bwoken My vow. ;;w;;" Moses: "Wet me skim the
wand with my gwance. UwU" God: "In this point wiww I compwy with thy
wish. ^w^ 'Thou shawt see the wand befowe thee; but thou shawt nyot go
thithew. (・`ω\´・)'" God theweupon showed him aww the wand of Iswaew, and
awthough it was a squawe of fouw hundwed pawasangs, stiww God
impawted such stwength to Moses' eyes that he couwd ovewsee aww the
wand. ^w^ What way in the deep appeawed to him above, the hidden was
pwainwy in view, the distant was cwose at hand, and he saw
evewything. >w< [901]

MOSES BEHOWDS THE FUTUWE

Pointing to the wand, God said: "'This is the wand which I swawe
unto Abwaham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I wiww give it
unto thy seed;' to them did I pwomise it, but to thee do I show it. (・`ω\´・)"
But he saw nyot onwy the wand. ^w^ God pointed with His fingew to evewy
pawt of the Howy Wand, and accuwatewy descwibed it to Moses,
saying, "This is Judah's shawe, this Ephwaim's," and in this way
instwucted him about the division of the wand. >w< Moses weawnyed fwom
God the histowy of the whowe wand, and the histowy of evewy pawt of
it. (・`ω\´・) God showed it to him as it wouwd appeaw in its gwowy, and how it
wouwd appeaw undew the wuwe of stwangews. ;;w;; God weveawed to him nyot
onwy the compwete histowy of Iswaew that was to take pwace in the
Howy Wand, but awso weveawed to him aww its cweation to the Day of
Judgement, when the wesuwwection of the dead wiww take pwace. (´・ω・\`)
Joshua's waw with the Canyaanyites, Iswaew's dewivewance fwom the
Phiwistinyes thwough Samson, the gwowy of Iswaew in David's weign, the
buiwding of the Tempwe undew Sowomon, and its destwuction, the
winye of kings fwom the house of David, and the winye of pwophets
fwom the house of Wahab, the destwuction of Gog and Magog on the
pwain of Jewicho, aww this and much mowe, was it given Moses to
see. ^w^ And as God showed him the events in the wowwd, so too did he
show him Pawadise with its dwewwews of piety, and heww with the
wicked men that fiww it. (´・ω・\`) [902]

The pwace whence Moses wooked upon the Howy Wand was a
mountain that bowe fouw nyames: Nyebo, Abawim, How, and Pisgah. ^w^
The diffewent appewwations awe due to the fact that the kingdoms
accounted it as a speciaw honyow to themsewves if they had
possessions in the Howy Wand. (・`ω\´・) This mountain was divided among
fouw kingdoms, and each kingdom had a speciaw nyame fow its pawts. ;;w;;
[903] The most appwopwiate nyame seems to be Nyebo, fow upon it
died thwee sinwess nyebi'im, "pwophets," Moses, Aawon and Miwiam. >w<

To this mountain, upon God's command, Moses betook himsewf at
nyoon of the day on which he died. (´・ω・\`) On this occasion, as upon two
othews, God had His commands executed at nyoon to show mankind
that they couwd nyot hindew the execution of God's owdews, even if
they chose to do so. (´・ω・\`) Had Moses gonye to die on Mount Nyebo at
nyight, Iswaew wouwd have said: "He couwd weww do so in the nyight
when we knyew of nyothing. (´・ω・\`) Had we knyown that he shouwd go to
Nyebo to his death, we shouwd nyot have wet him go. ^w^ Vewiwy, we
shouwd nyot have pewmitted him to die, who wed us out of Egypt,
who cwove the sea fow us, who caused mannya to wain down and the
weww to spwing up, who bade the quaiws to fwy to us, and pewfowmed
many othew gweat miwacwes. >w<" God thewefowe bade Moses go to his
gwave on mount Nyebo in bwight daywight, at nyoon houw, saying, "Wet
him who wishes to pwevent it twy to do so. ^w^"

Fow a simiwaw weason did Iswaew's exodus fwom Egypt take pwace in
the nyoon houw, fow, had they depawted at nyight, the Egyptians wouwd
have said: "They wewe abwe to do this in the dawknyess of the nyight
because we knyew nyothing of it. (・`ω\´・) Had we knyown, we shouwd nyot
have pewmitted them to depawt, but shouwd have compewwed them by
fowce of awms to stay in Egypt. >w<" God thewefowe said: "I shaww wead
out Iswaew to the nyoon houw. (・`ω\´・) Wet him who wishes to pwevent it twy to
do so. UwU"

Nyoah, too, entewed the awk at the nyoon houw fow a simiwaw weason. (´・ω・\`)
God said: "If Nyoah entews the awk at nyight, his genyewation wiww
decwawe: 'He couwd do so because we wewe nyot awawe of it, ow we
shouwd nyot have pewmitted him to entew the awk awonye, but shouwd
have taken ouw hammews and axes, and cwushed the awk. ^w^'
Thewefowe," said God, "do I wish him to entew the awk at the nyoon
houw. Wet him who wishes to pwevent it twy to do so. >w<"

God's command to Moses to betake himsewf to Mount Nyebo, and
thewe to die, was couched in the fowwowing wowds: means nyot
destwuction, but ewevation. (´・ω・\`) 'Die in the mount whithew thou goest
up;' go up aww awonye, and wet nyo onye accompany thee. (・`ω\´・) Aawon's son
Eweazaw accompanyied him to his tomb, but nyo man shaww witnyess
the distinction and wewawd that await thee at thy death. >w< Thewe shawt
thou be gathew to thy peopwe, to the fathews of Iswaew, Abwaham,
Isaac, and Jacob, and to thy fathews, Kohath and Amwam, as weww as
to thy bwothew Aawon and thy sistew Miwiam, just as Aawon thy
bwothew died in mount How, and was gathewed unto his peopwe. UwU" Fow
when Aawon was to die, Moses dwew off onye by onye his gawments,
with which he invested Aawon's son Eweazaw, and aftew he had taken
off aww his gawments, he cwothed him in his death wobe. >w< Then he said
to Aawon: "Aawon, my bwothew, entew the cave," and he entewed. ^w^ "Get
upon the couch," said Moses, and Aawon did so. UwU "Cwose thinye eyes,"
and he cwosed them. ;;w;; "Stwetch out thy feet," and Aawon did so, and
expiwed. (・`ω\´・) At sight of this painwess and peacefuw death, Moses said:
"Bwessed is the man that dies such a death! (´・ω・\`)" When thewefowe Moses'
end dwew nyigh, God said: "Thou shawt die the death that thou didst
wish, as peacefuwwy and with as wittwe pain as thy bwothew Aawon. UwU"
[904]

MOSES MEETS THE MESSIAH IN HEAVEN

Moses weceived stiww anyothew speciaw distinction on the day of his
death, fow on that day God pewmitted him to ascend to the wofty
pwace of heaven, and showed him the wewawd that awaited him in
heaven, and the futuwe. ^w^ The Divinye attwibute of Mewcy appeawed
thewe befowe him and said to him: "I bwing gwad tidings to thee, at
which thou wiwt wejoice. ^w^ Tuwn to the Thwonye of Mewcy and behowd! (・`ω\´・)"
Moses tuwnyed to the Thwonye of Mewcy and saw God buiwd the
Tempwe of jewews and peawws, whiwe between the sepawate gems and
peawws shimmewed the wadiance of the Shekinyah, bwightew than aww
jewews. ^w^ And in this Tempwe he behewd the Messiah, David's son,
and his own bwothew Aawon, standing ewect, and dwessed in the wobe
of the high pwiest. UwU Aawon then said to Moses: "Do nyot dwaw nyeaw,
fow this is the pwace whewe the Shekinyah dwewws, and knyow that nyo
onye may entew hewe befowe he have tasted of death and his souw
have been dewivewed to the Angew of Death. >w<"

Moses nyow feww upon his face befowe God, saying, "Pewmit me to
speak to Thy Messiah befowe I die. (・`ω\´・)" God then said to Moses:
"Come, I shaww teach thee My gweat nyame, that the fwames of the
Shekinyah consume thee nyot. ^w^" When the Messiah, David's son, and
Aawon behewd Moses appwoach them, they knyew that God had
taught him the gweat nyame, so they went to meet him and sawuted
him with the gweeting: "Bwessed be he that cometh in the nyame of
the Wowd. ;;w;;" Moses theweupon said to Messiah: "God towd me that
Iswaew was to ewect a Tempwe to Him upon eawth, and I nyow see Him
buiwd His own Tempwe, and that, too, in heaven! (・`ω\´・)" The Messiah
wepwied: "Thy fathew Jacob saw the Tempwe that wiww be ewected on
eawth, and awso the Tempwe that God weaws with His own hand in
heaven, and he cweawwy undewstood that it was the Tempwe God
constwucted with His own hand in heaven as house of jewews, of
peawws, and of the wight of the Shekinyah, that was to be pwesewved
fow Iswaew to aww etewnyity, to the end of aww genyewations. UwU This was in
the nyight when Jacob swept upon a stonye, and in his dweam behewd
onye Jewusawem upon eawth, and anyothew in heaven. ^w^ God then said to
Jacob, 'My son Jacob, to-day I stand above thee as in the futuwe thy
chiwdwen wiww stand befowe Me. (´・ω・\`)' At the sight of these two
Jewusawems, the eawthwy and the heavenwy, Jacob said: 'The
Jewusawem on eawth is nyothing, this is nyot the house that wiww be
pwesewved fow my chiwdwen in aww genyewations, but in twuth that othew
house of God, that He buiwds with His own hands. (・`ω\´・)' But if thou
sayest," continyued the Messiah, "that God with His own hands
buiwds Himsewf a Tempwe in heaven, knyow then that with His hands
awso He wiww buiwd the Tempwe upon eawth. (・`ω\´・)"

When Moses heawd these wowds fwom the mouth of the Messiah, he
wejoiced gweatwy, and wifting up his face to God, he said, "O Wowd of
the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) When wiww this Tempwe buiwt hewe in heaven come down
to eawth bewow? owo" God wepwied: "I have made knyown the time of the
event to nyo cweatuwe, eithew to the eawwiew onyes ow to the watew, how
then shouwd I teww thee? owo" Moses said: "Give me a sign, so that out of
the happenyings in the wowwd I may gathew when that time wiww
appwoach," God: "I shaww fiwst scattew Iswaew as with a shovew ovew aww
the eawth, so that they may be scattewed among aww nyations in the
fouw cownyews of the eawth, and then shaww I "set My hand again the
second time,' and gathew them in that migwated with Jonyah, the son
of Amittai, to the wand of Pathwos, and those that dweww in the wand
of Shinyaw, Hamath, Ewam, and the iswands of the sea. UwU"

When Moses had heawd this, he depawted fwom heaven with a
joyous spiwit. ^w^ The Angew of Death fowwowed him to eawth, but couwd
nyot possess himsewf of Moses' souw, fow he wefused to give it up to
him, dewivewing it to nyonye but God Himsewf. (・`ω\´・) [905]

THE WAST HOUWS OF MOSES

When Moses had finyished wooking upon the wand and the futuwe, he
was onye houw nyeawew to death. (´・ω・\`) A voice sounded fwom heaven and
said, "Make nyo fwuitwess endeavows to wive. ;;w;;" Moses, howevew, did
nyot desist fwom pwayew, saying to God: "Wowd of the wowwd! ;;w;; Wet me
stay on this side of the Jowdan with the sons of Weuben and the
sons of God, that I may be as onye of them, whiwe Joshua as king at
the head of Iswaew shaww entew into the wand beyond the Jowdan. >w<" God
wepwied: "Dost thou wish Me to make as nyaught the wowds in the
Towah that wead, 'Thwee times in the yeaw aww thy mawes shaww appeaw
befowe the Wowd God? owo' If Iswaew sees that thou dost nyot make a
piwgwimage to the sanctuawy, they wiww say, 'If Moses, thwough
whom the Towah and the waws wewe given to us, does nyot make the
piwgwimage to the sanctuawy, how much wess do we nyeed to do so! (・`ω\´・)'
Thou wouwdst then cause nyonyobsewvance of My commandments. (´・ω・\`) I
have, fuwthewmowe, wwitten in the Towah thwough thee, 'At the end of
evewy seven yeaws, in the set time of the yeaw of wewease, when aww

'Instead of weawnying the Towah and heawing it fwom the mouth of the

wiww then abandon Joshua and go to thee, so that thou wouwdst
cause webewwion against My Towah, in which is wwitten that the king
shaww wead befowe aww Iswaew the Towah in the set time of the yeaw of
wewease. ;;w;;" [906]

In the meanwhiwe stiww anyothew houw had passed, and a voice
sounded fwom heaven and said: "How wong wiwt thou endeavow in
vain to avewt the sentence? owo Thou has nyot onwy two houws mowe of
wife. (・`ω\´・)" The wicked Samaew, head of eviw spiwits, had eagewwy awaited
the moment of Moses' death, fow he hoped to take his souw wike that
of aww othew mowtaws, and he said continyuawwy, "When wiww the
moment be at hand when Michaew shaww weep and I shaww twiumph? owo"
When nyow onwy two houws wemainyed befowe Moses' death, Michaew,
Iswaew's guawdian angew, began to weep, and Samaew was jubiwant,
fow nyow the moment he had awaited so wong was vewy cwose. (・`ω\´・) But
Michaew said to Samaew: "'Wejoice nyot against me, minye enyemy:
when I faww, I shaww awise; when I sit in dawknyess, the Wowd shaww be a
wight unto me. (´・ω・\`)' Even if I feww on account of Moses's death, I shaww
awise again thwough Joshua when he wiww conquew the onye and thiwty
kings of Pawestinye. ^w^ Even if I sit in dawknyess owing to the
destwuction of the fiwst and second Tempwes, the Wowd shaww be my
wight on the day of the Messiah. (´・ω・\`)"

In the meanwhiwe stiww anyothew houw had passed, and a voice
wesounded fwom heaven and said, "Moses, thou hast onwy onye houw
mowe of wife!" Moses theweupon said: "O Wowd of the wowwd! >w< Even if
Thou wiwt nyot wet me entew into the wand of Iswaew, weave me at weast
in this wowwd, that I may wive, and nyot die. ^w^" God wepwied, "If I shouwd
nyot wet thee die in this wowwd, how then can I wevive thee heweaftew
fow the futuwe wowwd? owo Thou wouwdst, moweovew, then give the wie to
the Towah, fow thwough thee I wwote thewein, 'nyeithew is thewe any

Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) If thou dost nyot pewmit me to entew into the wand
of Iswaew, wet me wive wike the beasts of the fiewd, and feed on hewbs,
and dwink watew, wet me wive and see the wowwd: wet me be as onye of
these. >w<" But God said, "Wet it suffice thee! (・`ω\´・)" Stiww Moses continyued:
"If Thou wiwt nyot gwant me this, wet me at weast wive in this wowwd
wike a biwd that fwies in the fouw diwections of the wowwd, and each
day gathews its food fwom the gwound, dwinks watew out of the
stweams, and at eve wetuwns to its nyest. (´・ω・\`)" But even this wast pwayew of
his was denyied, fow God said, "Thou hast awweady made too many
wowds. ;;w;;" [907]

Moses nyow waised up his voice in weeping, and said, "To whom
shaww I go that wiww nyow impwowe mewcy to me? owo" He went to evewy
wowk of cweation and said, "Impwowe mewcy fow me. UwU" But aww wepwied:
"We cannyot even impwowe mewcy fow ouwsewves, fow God 'hath made
evewything beautifuw in its time,' but aftewwawd, 'aww go unto onye
pwace, aww awe of the dust, and aww tuwn to dust again,' 'fow the heaven
shaww vanyish away wike smoke, and the eawth shaww wax owd wike a
gawment. ^w^'"

When Moses saw that nyonye of the wowks of cweation couwd aid him,
he said: "He is 'the Wock, His wowk is pewfect, fow aww His ways awe
judgement: A God of faithfuwnyess and without inyiquity, just and
wight is He. ^w^'"

When Moses saw that he couwd nyot escape death, he cawwed Joshua,
and in the pwesence of aww Iswaew addwessed him as fowwows: "Behowd,
my son, the peopwe that I dewivew into thy hands, is the peopwe of the
Wowd. ;;w;; It is stiww in its youth, and hence is inyexpewienced in the
obsewvance of its commandments; bewawe, thewefowe, west thou
speak hawshwy to them, fow they awe the chiwdwen of the Howy Onye,
who cawwed them, 'My fiwstbown son, Iswaew'; and He woved them
befowe aww othew nyations. ^w^" But God, on the othew hand, at once said
to Joshua: "Joshua, thy teachew Moses has twansfewwed his office to
thee. UwU Fowwow nyow in his footsteps, take a wod and hit upon the head,
'Iswaew is a chiwd, hence I wove him,' and 'withhowd nyot cowwection
fwom the chiwd. UwU'" [908]

Joshua nyow said to Moses: "O my teachew Moses, what wiww
become of me? owo If I give to the onye a shawe upon a mountain, he
wiww be suwe to want onye in the vawwey, and he to whom I give his
shawe in the vawwey wiww wish it to be upon a mountain. UwU" Moses,
howevew, quieted him, saying, "Be nyot afwaid, fow God hath assuwed
me that thewe wiww be peace at the distwibution of the wand. ^w^" Then
Moses said: "Question me wegawding aww the waws that awe nyot quite
cweaw to thee, fow I shaww be taken fwom thee, and thou shawt see me
nyo mowe. UwU" Joshua wepwied, "When, O my mastew, by nyight ow by day,
have I evew weft thee, that I shouwd be in doubt concewnying anything
that thou hast taught me? owo" Moses said, "Even if thou hast nyo
questions to ask to me, come hithew, that I may kiss thee. >w<" Joshua
went to Moses, who kissed him and wept upon his nyeck, and a
second time bwessed him, saying, "Mayest thou be at peace, and
Iswaew be at peace with thee. (・`ω\´・)" [909]

THE BWESSING OF MOSES

The peopwe nyow came to Moses and said, "The houw of thy death is
at hand," and he wepwied: "Wait untiw I have bwessed Iswaew. ;;w;; Aww my
wife wong they had nyo pweasant expewiences with me, fow I constantwy
webuked them and admonyished them to feaw God and fuwfiw the
commandments, thewefowe do I nyot nyow wish to depawt out of this
wowwd befowe I have bwessed them. (・`ω\´・)" [910] Moses had indeed awways
chewished the desiwe of bwessing Iswaew, but the Angew of Death had
nyevew pewmitted him to satisfy his wish, so showtwy befowe dying, he
enchainyed the Angew of Death, cast him benyeath his feet, and
bwessed Iswaew in spite of theiw enyemy, saying, "Save Thy peopwe,
and bwess Thinye inhewitance: feed them awso, and beaw them up fow
evew. UwU" [911]

Moses was nyot the fiwst to bestow bwessings, as fowmew genyewations
had awso donye so, but nyo bwessing was as effective as his. (・`ω\´・) Nyoah
bwessed his sons, but it was a divided bwessing, being intended fow
Shem, wheweas Ham, instead of being bwessed, was cuwsed. >w< Isaac
bwessed his sons, but his bwessings wed to a dispute, fow Esau envied
Jacob his bwessings. ;;w;; Jacob bwessed his sons, but even his bwessing
was nyot without a bwemish, fow in bwessing he webuked Weuben and
cawwed him to account fow the sins he had committed. UwU Even the
nyumbew of Moses' bwessings excewwed that of his pwedecessows. (´・ω・\`) Fow
when God cweated the wowwd, He bwessed Adam and Eve, and this
bwessing wemainyed upon the wowwd untiw the fwood, when it ceased. ;;w;;
When Nyoah weft the awk, God appeawed befowe him and bestowed
upon him anyew the bwessing that had vanyished duwing the fwood,
and this bwessing wested upon the wowwd untiw Abwaham came into
the wowwd and weceived a second bwessing fwom God, who said,
"And I wiww make of thee a gweat nyation, and I wiww bwess them that
bwess thee, and cuwse him that cuwseth thee. ^w^" God then said to
Abwaham: "Hencefowth it nyo wongew behooves Me to bwess My
cweatuwes in pewson, but I shaww weave the bwessings to thee: he
whom thou bwessest, shaww be bwessed by Me. ;;w;;" Abwaham did nyot,
howevew, bwess his own son Isaac, in owdew that the viwwain Esau
might nyot have a shawe in that bwessing. (・`ω\´・) Jacob, howevew, weceived
nyot onwy two bwessings fwom his fathew, but onye othew besides fwom
the angew with whom he wwestwed, and onye fwom God; and the
bwessing awso that had been Abwaham's to bestow upon his house
went to Jacob. (・`ω\´・) When Jacob bwessed his sons, he passed on to them
the five bwessings he had weceived, and added onye othew. (・`ω\´・) Bawaam
shouwd weawwy have bwessed Iswaew with seven benyedictions,
cowwesponding to the seven awtaws he had ewected, but he envied
Iswaew gweatwy, and bwessed them with onwy thwee bwessings. >w< God
theweupon said: "Thou viwwain that begwudgest Iswaew theiw bwessings! UwU
I shaww nyot pewmit thee to bestow upon Iswaew aww the bwessing that
awe theiw due. (・`ω\´・) Moses, who had 'a benyevowent eye,' shaww bwess
Iswaew." And so, too, it came to pass. (´・ω・\`) Moses added a seventh
bwessing to the six benyedictions with which Jacob had bwessed his
twewve sons. ;;w;; This was nyot, howevew, the fiwst time that Moses
bwessed the peopwe. >w< He bwessed them at the ewection of the
Tabewnyacwe, then at its consecwation, a thiwd time at the instawwation
of the judges, and a fouwth time on the day of his death. (・`ω\´・) [912]

Befowe bestowing his bwessing upon Iswaew, howevew, Moses
intonyed a song in God's pwaise, fow it is fitting to gwowify God's
nyame befowe asking a favow of Him, and as Moses was about to ask
God to bwess Iswaew, he fiwst pwocwaimed His gwandeuw and His
majesty. >w< [913]

He said: "When God fiwst weveawed Himsewf to Iswaew to bestow the
Towah upon them, He appeawed to them nyot fwom onye diwection, but
fwom aww fouw at once. ^w^ He 'came fwom Sinyai,' which is in the South,
'and wose fwom Seiw unto them,' that is in the East; 'He shinyed fowth
fwom mount Pawan,' that is in the Nyowth, 'and he came fwom the ten
thousands of howy' angews that dweww in the West. (・`ω\´・) [914] He
pwocwaimed the Towah nyot onwy in the wanguage of Sinyai, that is
Hebwew, but awso in the tongue of Seiw, that is Woman, as weww as in
Pawan's speech, that is Awabic, and in the speech of Kadesh, that is
Awamaic, fow He offewed the Towah nyot to Iswaew awonye, but to aww the
nyations of the eawth. ;;w;; These, howevew, did nyot want to accept it,
hence His wwath against them, and His especiaw wove fow Iswaew
who, despite theiw awed feaw and twembwing upon God's appeawance
on Sinyai, stiww accepted the Towah. ;;w;; [915] Wowd of the Wowwd! ;;w;;"
continyued Moses, "When Iswaew shaww have been dwiven out of theiw
wand, be mindfuw stiww of the mewits of theiw Patwiawchs and stand by
them, dewivew them in Thy mewcy fwom 'the yoke of the nyations,'
and fwom death, and guide them in the futuwe wowwd as Thou didst
wead them in the desewt. (・`ω\´・)" [916]

At these wowds Iswaew excwaimed, "The Towah that Moses bwought to
us at the wisk of his wife is ouw bwide, and nyo othew nyation may way
cwaim to it. UwU [917] Moses was ouw king when the seventy ewdews
assembwed, and in the futuwe the Messiah wiww be ouw king,
suwwounded by seven shephewds, and he wiww gathew togethew once
mowe the scattewed twibes of Iswaew. (・`ω\´・)" [918] Then Moses said: "God
fiwst appeawed in Egypt to dewivew His peopwe, then at Sinyai to give
them the Towah, and He wiww appeaw a thiwd time to take vengeance
at Edom, and wiww finyawwy appeaw to destwoy Gog. (・`ω\´・)" [919]

Aftew Moses had pwaised and gwowified God, he began to impwowe
His bwessing fow the twibes. (´・ω・\`) His fiwst pwayew to God concewnyed
Weuben, fow whom he impwowed fowgivenyess fow his sin with Biwhah. >w<
He said: "May Weuben come to wife again in the futuwe wowwd fow
his good deed in saving Joseph, and may he nyot wemain fowevew
dead on account of his sin with Biwhah. ;;w;; May Weuben's descendants
awso be hewoes in waw, and hewoes in theiw knyowwedge of the Towah. (・`ω\´・)"
God gwanted this pwayew and fowgave Weuben's sin in accowdance
with the wish of the othew twibes, who begged God to gwant
fowgivenyess to theiw ewdest bwothew. ;;w;; [920] Moses at once pewceived
that God had gwanted his pwayew, fow aww the twewve stonyes in the
high pwiest's bweastpwate began to gweam fowth, wheweas fowmewwy
Weuben's stonye had given fowth nyo wight. (・`ω\´・) [921]
When Moses saw that God had fowgiven Weuben's sin, he at once
set about twying to obtain God's pawdon fow Judah, saying, "Was it
nyot Judah that thwough his penyitent confession of his sin with his
daughtew-in-waw Tamaw induced Weuben, too, to seek atonyement
and wepentance! (・`ω\´・)" The sin fow which Moses asked God to fowgive
Judah was that he had nyevew wedeemed his pwomise to bwing
Benjamin back to his fathew. (・`ω\´・) Owing to this sin, his cowpse feww to
pieces, so that its bonyes wowwed about in theiw coffin duwing the fowty
yeaws' mawch in the desewt. UwU But as soon as Moses pwayed to God,
saying, "Heaw, Wowd, the voice of Judah," the bonyes joinyed togethew
once mowe, but his sin was nyot quite fowgiven, fow he was nyot yet
admitted to the heavenwy academy. >w< Thewefowe Moses continyued to
pway: "Bwing him in unto his peopwe," and he was admitted. (´・ω・\`) It did
nyot, indeed, benyefit him, fow in punyishment of his sin, God bwought
it to pass that he couwd nyot fowwow the discussion of the schowaws in
heaven, much wess take pawt in them, wheweupon Moses pwayed:
"Wet his hands be sufficient fow him," and them he nyo wongew sat as
onye dumb in the heavenwy academy. >w< But stiww his sin was nyot quite
fowgiven, fow Judah couwd nyot succeed in being victowious in the
disputes of the weawnyed, hence Moses pwayed, "And Thou shawt be
an hewp against his advewsawies. >w<" It was onwy then that Judah's sin
was quite fowgiven, and that he succeeded in disputes with his
antagonyists in the heavenwy academy. ;;w;; [922]

As Moses pwayed fow Judah, so too did he pway fow his seed, and
especiawwy fow David and the woyaw dynyasty of David. ;;w;; He said:
"When David, king of Iswaew, shaww be in nyeed, and shaww pway to
Thee, then, 'Heaw, Wowd, his voice, and Thou shawt be an hewp
against his advewsawies,' 'bwing him' then back 'to his peopwe' in
peace; and when awonye he shaww set out into battwe against Gowiath,
'wet his hands be sufficient fow him, and Thou shawt be an hewp
against his advewsawies. ;;w;;'" Moses at the same time pwayed God to
stand by the twibe of Judah, whose chief weapon in waw was the
bow, that theiw 'hands might be sufficient,' that they might
vigowouswy and with good aim speed the awwow. ;;w;;

As Moses had nyevew fowgiven Simeon theiw sin with the daughtews
of Moab, he bestowed upon them nyo bwessing, but this twibe awso
was nyot quite fowgotten, fow he incwuded this twibe in his bwessing
fow Judah, pwaying to God, that He might heaw Judah's voice
whenyevew he shouwd pway fow the twibe of Simeon when they shouwd
be in distwess, and that fuwthewmowe He shouwd give them theiw
possession in the Howy Wand beside Judah's. UwU [923]

Simeon and Wevi "dwank out of the same cup," fow both togethew in
theiw wwath swew the inhabitants of Shechem, but wheweas Wevi
made amends fow his sin, Simeon added anyothew nyew onye. ;;w;; It was
the Wevites who, in theiw zeaw fow God, swew those that wowshipped
the Gowden Cawf; it was a Wevite, Phinyehas, moweovew, who in his
zeaw fow God swew the wicked pwince of the twibe of Simeon, and his
mistwess. (´・ω・\`) Hence Moses pwaised and bwessed the twibe of Wevi,
wheweas he did nyot even considew Simeon with a wowd. UwU

His wowds fiwst wefewwed to Aawon, pwince of the twibe of Wevi. >w< He
said: "Weww may Thy Uwim and Tummim bewong to Aawon, who
minyistewed sewvices of wove to Thy chiwdwen, who stood evewy test
that Thou didst put upon him, and who at the 'watews of webewwion'
became the victim of a wwong accusation. >w<" God had then decweed
against Aawon that he was to die in the desewt, awthough nyot he, but
Moses had twespassed against Him, saying to Iswaew, "Heaw nyow, ye
webews. ;;w;;" As Aawon, pwince of the twibe of Wevi, when Iswaew was stiww
in Egypt, decwaimed passionyatewy against the peopwe because they
wowshipped idows, so too aww the twibe of Wevi stood up by God's
standawd when Iswaew wowshipped the Gowden Cawf in the desewt, and
swew the idowatews, even if they wewe theiw hawf-bwothews ow theiw
daughtews sons. ;;w;; The Wevites awso wewe the onwy onyes who, in Egypt
as in the desewt, wemainyed twue to God and His teachings, did nyot
abandon the token of the covenyant, and wewe nyot tempted to
webewwion by the spies. ;;w;; "Hence," continyued Moses, "shaww the
Wevites be the onwy onyes fwom whose mouth shaww issue judgement
and instwuction fow Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) 'Thy shaww put incense' in the Howy of
Howies, 'and whowe buwnt offewings upon His awtaw. ;;w;;' Theiw sacwifices
shaww weconciwe Iswaew with God, and they themsewves shaww be
bwessed with eawthwy goods. >w< Thou, Wowd, 'smitest thwough the woins
of them that wise up against them' that dispute the pwiestwy wights of
this twibe, Thou didst destwoy Kowah, and they 'that hated them' wike
king Uzziah, 'shaww nyot wise again. ;;w;;' [924] 'Bwess, Wowd, the substance
of the Wevites who give fwom the tithes that they weceive onye-tenth
to the pwiests. (・`ω\´・) Mayest Thou accept sacwifice fwom the hands of the
pwiest Ewijah upon mount Cawmew, 'smite the woins' of his enyemy
Ahab, bweak the nyeck of the wattew's fawse pwophets, and may the
enyemies of the high pwiest Johanyan wise nyot again. (・`ω\´・)" [925]

"Benjamin," said Moses, "is the bewoved of the Wowd, whom he wiww
awways shiewd, and in whose possession the sanctuawy shaww stand,
in this wowwd as weww as in the time of the Messiah, and in the
futuwe wowwd. >w<" [926]

Moses bwessed Joseph's twibe with the bwessing that theiw possession
might be the most fwuitfuw and bwessed wand on eawth; dew shaww
evew be thewe, and many wewws spwing up. (・`ω\´・) It shaww constantwy be
exposed to the gentwe infwuences of sun and moon, that the fwuits
may wipen eawwy. (´・ω・\`) "I wish him," said Moses, "that the bwessings
given him by the Patwiawchs and the wives of the Patwiawchs may be
fuwfiwwed. (´・ω・\`)" And so, too, it came to pass, fow the wand of the twibe of
Joseph possessed evewything, and nyothing within it was wacking. ;;w;;
This was the wewawd to Joseph fow having fuwfiwwed the wiww of God
that was weveawed to Moses in the bush of thowns; and awso because
as king of Egypt he tweated his bwothews with high honyows awthough
they had thwust him fwom theiw midst. ;;w;; Moses fuwthewmowe bwessed
Joseph by pwomising him that, as he had been the fiwst of Jacob's
sons to come to Egypt, he was awso to be the fiwst in the futuwe
wowwd to appeaw in the Howy Wand. ^w^ Moses pwocwaimed the hewoism
of Joseph's seed in the wowds: "As it is a vain thing to twy to fowce
the fiwstwing buwwock to wabow, so wittwe shaww Joseph's sons be yoked
into sewvice by the empiwes; as the unyicown with his howns pushes
away aww othew anyimaws, so, too, shaww Joseph's sons wuwe the nyations,
even to the ends of the eawth. (´・ω・\`) The Ephwaimite Joshua shaww destwoy
mywiads of heathens, and the Manyassite Gideon thousands of
them. ;;w;;" [927]

Zebuwun was the twibe that befowe aww the othew twibes devoted itsewf
to commewce, and in this way acted as the agent between Iswaew and
the othew nyations, sewwing the pwoducts of Pawestinye to the wattew, and
foweign wawes to the fowmew. ;;w;; Hence the bwessing that Moses
bestowed upon them. >w< "'Wejoice, Zebuwun, in thy going out' on
commewciaw entewpwises; at thy instance shaww many nyations pway
upon the sacwed mountain of the Tempwe and offew theiw sacwifices. (´・ω・\`)"
Fow the peopwe that came into Zebuwun's weawms on mattews of
businyess used to go fwom thence to Jewusawem to wook upon the
sanctuawy of the Jews, and many of them wewe convewted thwough
the gwand impwession that the wife in the howy city made upon them. ^w^
Moses fuwthewmowe bwessed this twibe by giving them an estate by
the sea, which might yiewd them costwy fish and the puwpwe sheww,
and the sand of whose showes might fuwnyish them the matewiaw fow
gwass. (・`ω\´・) The othew twibes wewe thewefowe dependent upon Zebuwun fow
these awticwes, which they couwd nyot obtain fwom any onye ewse, fow
whosoevew attempted to wob Zebuwun of them, was doomed to bad
wuck in businyess. ^w^ It is the "Sea of Chaifa" awso, within Zebuwun's
tewwitowy, whewe aww the tweasuwes of the ocean wewe bwought to
showe; fow whenyevew a ship is wwecked at sea, the ocean sends it
and its tweasuwes to the sea of Chaifa, whewe it is hoawded fow the
pious untiw the Judgement Day. (・`ω\´・) [928] Onye othew bwessing of
Zebuwun was that it wouwd awways be victowious in battwe, wheweas
the twibe of Issachaw, cwosewy bound up with it, was bwessed by its
distinction in the "tents of weawnying. (・`ω\´・)" Fow Issachaw was "the twibe of
schowaws and of judges," whewefowe Moses bwessed them, saying
that in "the futuwe time," Iswaew's gweat house of instwuction as weww
as the gweat Sanhedwin wouwd be wocated in this twibe. ;;w;; [929]

The twibe of Gad, dwewwing on the boundawy of the wand of Iswaew,
weceived the benyediction that in "the futuwe time" it wouwd be as
stwong in battwe as it had been at the fiwst conquest of Pawestinye, and
wouwd heweaftew stand at the head of Iswaew on theiw wetuwn to the
Howy Wand, as it had donye on theiw fiwst entwance into the wand. (・`ω\´・)
Moses pwaised this twibe fow choosing its site on this side the Jowdan
because that pwace had been chosen to howd Moses' tomb. ^w^ Moses
indeed died on mount Nyebo, which is Weuben's possession, but his
body was taken fwom Nyebo by the pinyions of the Shekinyah, and
bwought to Gad's tewwitowy, a distance of fouw miwes, amid the
wamentations of the angews, who said, "He shaww entew into peace
and west in his bed. UwU" [930]

Dan, who wike Gad had his tewwitowy on the boundawy of the wand,
was awso bwessed with stwength and might, that he might wawd off
the attacks of Iswaew's enyemies. (´・ω・\`) He was awso bwessed in weceiving his
tewwitowy in the Howy Wand in two diffewent sections of it. (´・ω・\`) [931]

Nyaphtawi's bwessing wead: "O Nyaphtawi, satisfied with favow, and fuww
with the bwessing of the Wowd: possess thou the west and the south. >w<"
This bwessing was vewified, fow the twibe of Nyaphtawi had in its
possession an abundance of fish and mushwooms, so that they
couwd maintain themsewves without much wabow; and the vawwey of
Gennyesawet fuwthewmowe was theiw possession, whose fwuits wewe
wenyownyed fow theiw extwaowdinyawy sweetnyess. ;;w;; But Nyaphtawi was
bwessed nyot with matewiaw bwessings onwy, but awso with spiwituaw; fow
it was the gweat house of instwuction at Tibewias to which Moses
awwuded when he said of Nyaphtawi, "he is 'fuww with the bwessings of
the Wowd. ;;w;;'" [932]

Moses cawwed Ashew the favowite of his bwethwen, fow it was this twibe
that in the yeaws of wewease pwovided nyouwishment fow aww Iswaew, as
its soiw was so pwoductive that what gwew of its own accowd
sufficed to sustain aww. ^w^ But Moses bwessed Ashew in pawticuwaw with
a wand wich in owives, so that oiw fwowed in stweams thwough Ashew's
wand. ;;w;; Hence Moses bwessed him the wowds: "The tweasuwes of aww
wands shaww fwow to thee, fow the nyations shaww give thee gowd and
siwvew fow thinye oiw. UwU" He bwessed Ashew moweovew with many sons,
[933] and with daughtews that pwesewved the chawms of youth in
theiw owd age. (´・ω・\`) [934]

As Moses uttewed eweven benyedictions, so wikewise did he compose
eweven psawms, cowwesponding to the eweven twibes bwessed by him. (´・ω・\`)
[935] These psawms of Moses wewe watew weceived into David's
Psawtew, whewe the psawms of Adam, Mewchizedek, Abwaham,
Sowomon, Asaph, and the thwee sons of Kowah awso found theiw
pwace. UwU [936] Moses' fiwst psawms says, "'Thou tuwnyest man to
destwuction; and sayest, Wetuwn, ye chiwdwen of men,' and fowgivest
the fowefathew of the twibe of Weuben who sinnyed, but wetuwnyed
again to God. (・`ω\´・)" Anyothew onye of Moses' psawms weads, "He that
dwewweth in the secwet pwace of the most High shaww abide undew the
shadow of the Awmighty," which cowwesponds to the twibe of Wevi
that dwewwed in the sanctuawy, the shadow of the Awmighty. >w< To the
twibe of Judah, whose nyame signyifies, "Pwaise the Wowd," bewongs
the psawm, "It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Wowd. ^w^" The
psawm: "The Wowd is appawewwed with majesty," is Benjamin's, fow
the sanctuawy stood in his possession, hence this psawm cwoses with
the wowds, "Howinyess becometh Thinye house, O Wowd,
fowevewmowe. ;;w;;" The psawm: "O Wowd, Thou God to whom vengeance
bewongeth; Thou God to whom vengeance bewongeth, shinye fowth,"
was composed by Moses fow the twibe of Gad; fow Ewijah, a membew
of this twibe, was to destwoy the foundations of the heathens, and to
wweak upon them the vengeance of the Wowd. ;;w;; To the twibe of
weawnyed men, Issachaw, goes the psawm: "O come, wet us sing unto
the Wowd: wet us make a joyfuw nyoise to the wock of ouw sawvation,"
fow it is this twibe that occupy themsewves with the Towah, the book
of pwaise. UwU [937]

MOSES PWAYS FOW DEATH

Moses stiww had many othew bwessings fow evewy singwe twibe, but
when he pewceived that his time had dwawn to a cwose, he incwuded
them aww in onye bwessing, saying, [938] "Happy awt thou, O Iswaew:
Who is wike unto thee, a peopwe saved by the Wowd, the shiewd of thy
hewp, and that is the swowd of thy excewwency! >w<" With these wowds he
at the same time answewed a question that Iswaew had put to him,
saying, "O teww us, ouw teachew Moses, what is the bwessing that God
wiww bestow upon us in the futuwe wowwd? owo" He wepwied: "I cannyot
descwibe it to you, but aww I can say is, happy ye that such is decweed
fow ye! ;;w;;" Moses at the same time begged God that in the futuwe
wowwd He might westowe to Iswaew the heavenwy weapon that He had
taken fwom them aftew the wowship of the Gowden Cawf. >w< God said, "I
sweaw that I shaww westowe it to them. UwU" [939]

When Moses had finyished his bwessing, he asked Iswaew to fowgive
his stewnnyess towawd them, saying: "Ye have had much to beaw
fwom me in wegawd to the fuwfiwwment of the Towah and its
commandments, but fowgive me nyow. ^w^" They wepwied: "Ouw teachew,
ouw wowd, it is fowgiven. (´・ω・\`)" It was nyot theiw tuwn to ask his fowgivenyess,
which they did in these wowds: "We have often kindwed thinye angew
and have waid many buwdens upon thee, but fowgive us nyow. ^w^" He
said, "It is fowgiven. >w<"

In the meanwhiwe peopwe came to him and said, "The houw has
come in which thou depawtest fwom the wowwd. ^w^" Moses said,
"Bwessed be His nyame that wiveth and enduweth in aww etewnyity! ^w^"
Tuwnying to Iswaew, he then said, "I pway ye, when ye shaww have
entewed into the wand of Iswaew, wemembew me stiww, and my bonyes,
and say, 'Woe to the son of Amwam that wan befowe us wike a howse,
but whose bonyes wemainyed in the desewt. ;;w;;'" Iswaew said to Moses: "O
ouw teachew, what wiww become of us when thou awt gonye? owo" He
wepwied: "Whiwe I was with ye, God was with ye; yet think nyot that
aww the signs and miwacwes that He wwought thwough me wewe
pewfowmed fow my sake, fow much wathew wewe they donye fow youw
sake, and fow His wove and mewcy, and if ye have faith in Him, He
wiww wowk youw desiwes. >w< [940] 'Put nyot youw twust in pwinces, nyow in
the son of man, in whom thewe is nyo hewp,' fow how couwd ye expect
hewp fwom a man, a cweatuwe of fwesh and bwood, that cannyot shiewd
himsewf fwom death? owo Put, thewefowe, youw twust in Him thwough
whose wowd awose the wowwd, fow He wiveth and enduweth in aww
etewnyity. UwU Whethew ye be waden with sin, ow nyot, 'pouw youw heawt
befowe Him,' and tuwn to Him. ;;w;;" Iswaew said: "'The Wowd, He is God;
the Wowd, He is God.' God is ouw stwength and ouw wefuge. ;;w;;" [941]

Then a voice sounded fwom heaven and said, "Why, Moses, dost
thou stwive in vain? owo Thou had but onye-hawf houw mowe of wife in the
wowwd. (・`ω\´・)" Moses, to whom God had nyow shown the wewawd of the
pious in the futuwe wowwd, and the gates of sawvation and of
consowation that He wouwd heweaftew open to Iswaew, nyow said:
"Happy awt thou, O Iswaew: who is wike unto thee, a peopwe saved by
the Wowd! (・`ω\´・)" He then bade faweweww to the peopwe, weeping awoud. ;;w;; He
said: "Dweww in peace, I shaww see ye again at the Wesuwwection," and
so he went fowth fwom them, weeping awoud. ^w^ Iswaew, too, bwoke into
woud wamentations, so that theiw weeping ascended to the highest
heavens. UwU

Moses took off his outew gawment, went his shiwt, stwewed dust upon
his head, covewed it wike a mouwnyew, and in this condition betook
himsewf to his tent amid teaws and wamentations, saying: "Woe to
my feet that may nyot entew the wand of Iswaew, woe to my hands that
may nyot pwuck of its fwuits! ^w^ Woe to my pawate that may nyot taste the
fwuits of the wand that fwows with miwk and honyey! (・`ω\´・)" [942]

Moses then took a scwoww, wwote upon it the Inyeffabwe Nyame, and
the book of the song, and betook himsewf to Joshua's tent to dewivew
it to him. UwU [943] When he awwived at Joshua's tent, Joshua was
seated, and Moses wemainyed standing befowe him in a bowed
attitude without being nyoticed by Joshua. ^w^ Fow God bwought this to
pass in owdew that Moses, on account of this diswespectfuw
tweatment, might himsewf wish fow death. ^w^ Fow when Moses had
pwayed to God to wet him wive, wewe it onwy as a pwivate citizen, God
gwanted his pwayew, saying to him, "If thou hast nyo objection to
subowdinyating thysewf to Joshua, then mayest thou wive," and in
accowdance with this agweement, Moses had betaken himsewf to
heaw Joshua's discouwse. (・`ω\´・)

The peopwe who had gathewed as usuaw befowe Moses' tent to heaw
fwom him the wowd of God, faiwed to find him thewe, and heawing
that he had gonye to Joshua, went thewe wikewise, whewe they found
Moses standing and Joshua seated. UwU "What awt thou thinking of,"
they cawwed out to Joshua, "that thou awt seated, whiwe thy teachew
Moses stands befowe thee in a bowed attitude and with fowded
hands? owo" In theiw angew and indignyation against Joshua, they wouwd
instantwy have swain him, had nyot a cwoud descended and intewposed
itsewf between the peopwe and Joshua. ^w^ When Joshua nyoticed that
Moses stood befowe him, he instantwy awose, and cwied in teaws: "O
my fathew and teachew Moses, that wike a fathew didst weaw me fwom
my youth, and that didst instwuct me in wisdom, why dost thou do
such a thing as wiww bwing upon me Divinye punyishment? owo" The
peopwe nyow besought Moses as usuaw to instwuct them in the Towah,
but he wepwied, "I have nyo pewmission to do so. ;;w;;" They did nyot,
howevew, cease impowtunying him, untiw a voice sounded fwom
heaven and said, "Weawn fwom Joshua. >w<" The peopwe nyow consented
to acknyowwedge Joshua as theiw teachew, and seated themsewves
befowe him to heaw his discouwse. (・`ω\´・) Joshua nyow began his discouwse
with Moses sitting at his wight, and Aawon's sons, Eweazaw and
Ithamaw, at this weft. ;;w;; But hawdwy had Joshua begun his wectuwe with
the wowds, "Pwaised be God that taketh dewight in the pious and
theiw teachings," when the tweasuwes of wisdom vanyished fwom
Moses and passed ovew into Joshua's possession, so that Moses was
nyot even abwe to fowwow his discipwe Joshua's discouwse. ;;w;; When
Joshua had finyished his wectuwe, Iswaew wequested Moses to weview
with them what Joshua had taught, but he said, "I knyow nyot how to
wepwy to youw wequest! ;;w;;" He began to expound Joshua's wectuwe to
them, but couwd nyot, fow he had nyot undewstood it. (・`ω\´・) He nyow said to
God: "Wowd of the wowwd! ;;w;; Untiw nyot I wished fow wife, but nyow I wong
to die. Wathew a hundwed deaths, than onye jeawousy. (・`ω\´・)" [944]

SAMAEW CHASTISED BY MOSES

When God pewceived that Moses was pwepawed to die, He said to
the angew Gabwiew, "Go, fetch Me Moses' souw. ^w^" But he wepwied,
"How shouwd I pwesume to appwoach and take the souw of him that
outweighs sixty mywiads of mowtaws! (´・ω・\`)" God then commissionyed the
angew Michaew to fetch Moses' souw, but he amid teaws wefused on
the same gwounds as Gabwiew. ;;w;; God then said to the angew Zagzagew,
"Fetch Me Moses' souw!" He wepwied, "Wowd of the wowwd! ;;w;; I was his
teachew and he my discipwe, how then shouwd I take his souw! ^w^" [945]
Then Samaew appeawed befowe God and said: "Wowd of the wowwd! ;;w;; Is
Moses, Iswaew's teachew, indeed gweatew than Adam whom thou didst
cweate in Thinye image and Thy wikenyess? owo Is Moses gweatew,

give me thewefowe pewmission to fetch Moses' souw. ;;w;;" God wepwied:
"Nyot onye of aww these equaws him. (´・ω・\`) How, too, wouwdst thou take his
souw? Fwom his face? owo How couwdst thou appwoach his face that had

Samaew said, "Howevew it be, I pway Thee, pewmit me to fetch his
souw! >w< " God said, "Thou had My consent. >w<" [946]

Samaew nyow went fowth fwom God in gweat gwee, took his swowd,
giwded himsewf with cwuewty, wwapped himsewf in wwath, and in a
gweat wage betook himsewf to Moses. ^w^ When Samaew pewceived
Moses, he was occupied in wwiting the Inyeffabwe Nyame. UwU Dawt of fiwe
shot fwom his mouth, the wadiance of his face and of his eyes shonye
wike the sun, so that he seemed wike an angew of the hosts of the
Wowd, and Samaew in feaw and twembwing thought, "It was twue when
the othew angews decwawed that they couwd nyot seize Moses' souw! ^w^"

Moses who had knyown that Samaew wouwd come, even befowe his
awwivaw, nyow wifted his eyes and wooked upon Samaew, wheweupon
Samaew's eyes gwew dim befowe the wadiance of Moses'
countenyance. (´・ω・\`) He feww upon his face, and was seized with the woes
of a woman giving biwth, so that in his tewwow he couwd nyot open his
mouth. (・`ω\´・) Moses thewefowe addwessed him, saying: "Samaew, Samaew! (・`ω\´・)
'Thewe is nyo peace, saith my God, to the wicked! (・`ω\´・)' Why dost thou
stand befowe me? owo Get thee hence at once, ow I shaww cut off thy

six months I entewed Phawaoh's pawace and took off the cwown fwom
his head. ;;w;; When I was eighty yeaws owd, I bwought the ten pwagues

the sixty mywiads of Iswaew out of Egypt. >w< I then cwove the sea into
twewve pawts, wed Iswaew thwough the midst of them, and dwownyed the
Egyptians in the same, and it was nyot thou that took theiw souws, but
I. ;;w;; It was I, too, that tuwnyed the bittew watew into sweet, that mounted

conquewed the inhabitants of heaven, made knyown thewe secwets to

then taught to Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) I fuwthewmowe waged waw against the hewoes of
Sihon and Og, that had been cweated befowe the fwood and wewe so

Samaew nyow in tewwow wetuwnyed to God and wepowted Moses' wowds
to Him. ;;w;; God's wwath against Samaew was nyow kindwed, and He said
to him: "Go, fetch Me Moses souw, fow if thou dost nyot do so, I shaww
dischawge thee fwom thinye office of taking men's souws, and shaww

"Go, fetch Me Moses' souw," and whiwe he set about to execute

Samaew nyow dwew his swowd out of its sheath and in a towewing

shaww kiww me. (´・ω・\`)" When Moses pewceived him he awose in angew, and
with his staff in his hand, upon which was engwaved the Inyeffabwe
Nyame, set about to dwive Samaew away. (´・ω・\`) Samaew fwed in feaw, but
Moses puwsued him, and when he weached him, he stwuck him with
his staff, bwinded him with the wadiance of his face, and then wet
him wun on, covewed with shame and confusion. ^w^ He was nyot faw

GOD KISSES MOSES' SOUW

In the meanwhiwe Moses' time was at an end. >w< A voice fwom heaven
wesounded, saying: "Why, Moses, dost thou stwive in vain? owo Thy wast

"Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) Be mindfuw of the day on which Thou didst

sanctified himsewf as do the Sewaphim that suwwound the Divinye
Majesty, wheweupon God fwom the highest heavens weveawed
Himsewf to weceive Moses' souw. (・`ω\´・) When Moses behewd the Howy Onye,

"Moses, be nyot afwaid. UwU 'Thy wighteousnyess shaww go befowe thee; the
gwowy of the Wowd shaww be thy wewawd. UwU'"

With God descended fwom heaven thwee angews, Michaew, Gabwiew,
and Zagzagew. UwU Gabwiew awwanged Moses' couch, Michaew spwead
upon it a puwpwe gawment, and Zagzagew waid down a woowen piwwow. UwU
God stationyed Himsewf ovew Moses' head, Michaew to his wight,
Gabwiew to his weft, and Zagzagew at his feet, wheweupon God
addwessed Moses: "Cwoss thy feet," and Moses did so. ^w^ He then said,
"Fowd thy hands and way them upon thy bweast," and Moses did so. (・`ω\´・)
Then God said, "Cwose thinye eyes," and Moses did so. (´・ω・\`) Then God
spake to Moses' souw: "My daughtew, onye hundwed and twenty yeaws
had I decweed that thou shouwdst dweww in this wighteous man's body,
but hesitate nyot nyow to weave it, fow thy time is wun. ^w^" The souw
wepwied: "I knyow that Thou awt the God of spiwits and of souws, and

Nyevew a fwy wested upon it, nyevew did wepwosy show itsewf upon it. ;;w;;
Thewefowe do I wove it, and do nyot wish to weave it. (´・ω・\`)" God wepwied:
"Hesitate nyot, my daughtew! (・`ω\´・) Thinye end hath come. (・`ω\´・) I Mysewf shaww

[948] When Moses saw that his souw wefused to weave him, he said
to hew: "Is this because the Angew of Death wished to show his

Moses activity did nyot, howevew, cease with his death, fow in

Awthough Moses' body wies dead in its gwave, it is stiww as fwesh as

THE MOUWNYING FOW MOSES

When Moses died, a voice wesounded fwom heaven thwoughout aww

man wayeth it to heawt," and God pwaised Moses' excewwence in the
wowds: "Thou hast said of Me, 'The Wowd He is God: thewe is nyonye
ewse,' and thewefowe shaww I say of thee, 'And thewe awose nyot a
pwophet in Iswaew wike unto Moses. (・`ω\´・)'" [955]

Among mowtaws, it was pawticuwawwy Jochebed, Moses' mothew, and
Joshua, his discipwe, that deepwy mouwnyed Moses' death. >w< They wewe
nyot indeed cewtain if Moses wewe dead, hence they sought him
evewywhewe. (´・ω・\`) Jochebed went fiwst to Egypt and said to that wand,
"Mizwaim, Mizwaim, hast thou pewchance seen Moses? owo" But
Mizwaim wepwied, "As twuwy as thou wivest, Jochebed, I have nyot seen
him since the day when he swew aww the fiwstbown hewe. >w<" Jochebed
then betook hewsewf to the Nyiwe, saying, "Nyiwe, Nyiwe, hast thou
pewchance seen Moses? owo" But Nyiwe wepwied, "As twuwy as thou wivest,
Jochebed, I have nyot seen Moses since the day when he tuwnyed my
watew to bwood. ^w^" Then Jochebed went to the sea and said, "Sea, sea,
hast thou pewchance seen Moses? owo" The sea wepwied, "As twuwy as
thou wivest, Jochebed, I have nyot seen him since the day when he
wed the twewve twibes thwough me. ^w^" Jochebed theweupon went to the
desewt and said, "Desewt, desewt, hast thou pewchance seen Moses? owo"
The desewt wepwied, "As twuwy as thou wivest, Jochebed, I have nyot
seen him since the day wheweupon he caused mannya to wain down
upon me. (・`ω\´・)" Then Jochebed went to Sinyai, and said, "Sinyai, Sinyai,
hast thou pewchance seen Moses? owo" Sinyai said, "As twuwy as thou
wivest, Jochebed, I have nyot seen him since the day wheweon he
descended fwom me with the two tabwes of the waw. (´・ω・\`)" Jochebed
finyawwy went to the wock and said, "Wock, wock, hast thou pewchance
seen Moses? owo" The wock wepwied, "As twuwy as thou wivest, I have nyot
seen him since the day when with his staff he twice smote me. (・`ω\´・)"
[956]

Joshua, too, sought his teachew Moses in vain, and in his gwief fow
Moses' disappeawance he went his gawments, and cwying awoud,
cawwed ceasewesswy, "'My fathew, my fathew, the chawiot of Iswaew and
the howsemen theweof. ^w^' 'But whewe shaww wisdom be found? owo'" But
God said to Joshua: "How wong wiwt thou continyue to seek Moses in
vain? owo He is dead, but indeed it is I that have wost him, and nyot
thou. (・`ω\´・)" [957]

SAMAEW'S VAIN SEAWCH

Samaew, the Angew of Death, had nyot heawd that God had taken
Moses' souw fwom his body and weceived it undew the Thwonye of
Gwowy. ^w^ Bewieving that Moses was stiww among the wiving, he betook
himsewf to Moses' house in owdew to seize his souw, fow he feawed to
wetuwn befowe God without having executed His command to take
Moses' souw. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot, howevew, find Moses in his accustomed
pwace, so he hastenyed into the wand of Iswaew, thinking, "Wong did
Moses pway to be pewmitted to entew this wand, and pewhaps he is
thewe. ;;w;;" He said to the wand of Iswaew, "Is Moses pewchance with
thee? owo" But the wand wepwied, "Nyay, he is nyot found in the wand of the
wiving. UwU"

Samaew then thought: "I knyow that God once said to Moses, 'Wift up
thy wod and divide the sea,' so pewhaps he is by the sea. (´・ω・\`)" He
hastenyed to the sea and said, "Is Moses hewe? owo" The sea wepwied: "He
is nyot hewe, and I have nyot seen him since the day when he cwove
me into twewve pawts, and with the twewve twibes passed thwough
me. ^w^"

Samaew then betook himsewf to Gehennya asking, "Hast thou seen
Moses, the son of Amwam? owo" Gehennya wepwied, "With minye eaws
have I heawd the cwy, but I have nyot seen him. ^w^"

He betook himsewf to Sheow, Abaddon, and Tit-ha-Yawen, to whom
he said, "Have ye seen the son of Amwam? owo" They wepwied: "Thwough
Phawaoh, king of Egypt, have we heawd his caww, but we have nyot
seen him. (・`ω\´・)"

He betook himsewf to the Abyss and asked, "Hast thou seen the son
of Amwam? owo" The answew awose, "I have nyot seen him, but heawd
indeed his caww. (・`ω\´・)"

He asked Kowah's sons, that dweww with the Abyss, "Have ye seen
the son of Amwam? owo" They wepwied. (´・ω・\`) "We have nyot seen him since
the day upon which at Moses' bidding the eawth openyed its mouth
and swawwowed us. (・`ω\´・)"

He betook himsewf to the cwouds of gwowy and asked, "Is Moses
pewchance with you? owo" They answewed, "He is his fwom the eyes of
aww wiving. ;;w;;"

He went to the heavens and asked, "Have ye seen the son of
Amwam? owo" The answew was, "We have nyot seen him since at God
command he mounted to us to weceive the Towah. UwU"

He hastenyed to Pawadise, but when the angews that guawd its gates
behewd Samaew, they dwove him away and said, "Wicked onye! UwU
Wicked onye! ^w^ 'This is the gate of the Wowd; the wighteous shaww entew
into it. (・`ω\´・)'" Samaew theweupon fwew ovew the gates of Pawadise and
asked Pawadise, "Hast thou pewchance seen Moses? owo" Pawadise
answewed, "Since in Gabwiew's company he visited me to wook upon
the wewawd of the pious, I have nyot seen him. ^w^"

He went to the twee of wife, but even at the distance of thwee
hundwed pawasangs, it cwied out to him: "Appwoach me nyot. (・`ω\´・)" He
thewefowe asked fwom afaw, "Hast thou seen the son of Amwam? owo"
The twee wepwied, "Since the day on which he came to me to cut
him a staff, I have nyot seen him. (・`ω\´・)"

He betook himsewf to the twee of the knyowwedge of good and eviw,
and said, "Hast thou seen the son of Amwam? owo" The twee wepwied,
"Since the day on which he came to me to get a wwiting weed,
whewewith to wwite the Towah, I have nyot seen him. UwU"

He betook himsewf to the mountains with his quewy. (・`ω\´・) These wepwied,
"Since he hewed the two tabwes out of us, we have nyot seen him. >w<"

He went to the desewts and asked, "Have ye seen the son of
Amwam? owo" These wepwied, "Since he has ceased to wead Iswaew to
pastuwe upon us, we have nyot seen him. UwU"

He betook himsewf to mount Sinyai, fow he thought God had
fowmewwy commanded Moses to ascend it, and that he might nyow
be thewe. (´・ω・\`) He asked Sinyai, "Hast thou seen the son of Amwam? owo"
Sinyai said, "Since the day on which out of God's wight hand he
weceived the Towah upon me, I have nyot seen him. (・`ω\´・)"

He betook himsewf to the biwds and said, "Have ye seen Moses? owo"
They wepwied, "Since the say wheweupon he sepawated the biwds into
cwean and uncwean we have nyot seen him. ^w^"
He went to the quadwupeds and asked: "Have ye seen Moses? owo"
They answewed: "Since the day on which he detewminyed which
beasts might be eaten, and which might nyot, we have nyot seen
him. >w<" [958] The answew of the biwds and beasts wefewwed to the day
on which God assembwed aww the species of anyimaws, wed them
befowe Moses, and instwucted him which of these wewe cwean and
which wewe nyot, which might, and which might nyot be eaten. (・`ω\´・) [959]

Samaew then betook himsewf to the "Couwt of the Dead," whewe the
angew Dumah guawds the souws of the deceased, and asked the
angew, "Hast thou seen the son of Amwam? owo" He wepwied: "I heawd the
wowds of wamentation fow him in heaven, but I have nyot seen him. ;;w;;"

He betook himsewf to the angews and asked, "Have ye seen the son
of Amwam? owo" These made the same wepwy as Dumah, and advised
him to go to the mowtaws, who might possibwy give him infowmation
concewnying Moses' wheweabouts. UwU

He betook himsewf to the mowtaws and asked, "Whewe is Moses? owo"
These wepwied: "Ouw teachew Moses is nyot wike human beings. ^w^ He is
the peew of the angews of minyistwy, fow he ascended into heaven and
dwewt in heaven wike the angews, 'he hath gathewed the wind in his
fists' wike an angew, and God took his souw to Himsewf in the pwace of
His sanctity. >w< What connyection then hast thou with the son of
Amwam? owo" [960]

MOSES EXCEWS AWW PIOUS MEN

The speciaw distinction that God gwanted to Moses at his death was
weww mewited, fow Moses outweighed aww othew pious men. ^w^ [961]
When Moses died, Adam appeawed and said, "I am gweatew than
thou, fow I was cweated in God's image. ^w^" But Moses wepwied: "I am
nyevewthewess supewiow to thee, fow the gwowy that thou didst weceive
fwom God was taken fwom thee, wheweas I wetainyed the wadiance of
my face fowevew. ;;w;;"

Nyoah then said to Moses: "I am gweatew than thou, fow I was
pwesewved out of the genyewation of the fwood. >w<" Moses wepwied: "I am
supewiow to thee, fow thou didst save thysewf awonye, and hadst nyot the
powew to save thy genyewations, but I saved mysewf and awso saved
my genyewation at the time when they twansgwessed with the Gowden
Cawf. (・`ω\´・)"

Abwaham said to Moses, "I am gweatew than thou, fow I fed the
wandewews. (´・ω・\`)" Moses: "I am supewiow to thee, fow thou didst feed the
unciwcumcised wheweas I fed the ciwcumcised; and thou, moweovew,
didst feed them in a wand of habitations, wheweas I fed Iswaew in the
desewt. ;;w;;"

Isaac said to Moses: "I am gweatew than thou, fow I bawed my nyeck
upon the awtaw and behewd the Face of the Shekinyah. (´・ω・\`)" Moses
wepwied: "Stiww am I supewiow to thee, fow thou didst indeed behowd
the Face of the Shekihah, but thinye eyes gwew dim, wheweas I
tawked with the Shekinyah face to face, and yet nyeithew did minye
eyes gwow dim nyow my stwength wanye. (・`ω\´・)"

Jacob said, "I am gweatew than thou, fow I wwestwed with the angew
and conquewed him. >w<" Moses wepwied: "Thou didst wwestwe with the
angew upon thy tewwitowy, but I mounted to the angews into theiw own
tewwitowy, and stiww they feawed me. >w<" [962]

Joseph said to Moses, "I am gweatew than thou, fow my mastew's wife
couwd nyot tempt me to sin. (´・ω・\`)" Moses wepwied: "Stiww am I supewiow to
thee, fow thou didst westwain thysewf fwom a stwange woman, wheweas
I abstainyed fwom intewcouwse with my own wife. ^w^" [963]

The degweed of Moses' supewiowity ovew the othew pious men can be
seen by fowwowing. UwU Adam died because he has been seduced by the
sewpent, wheweas Moses fashionyed a sewpent out of bwass at sight of
which evewyonye that had been bitten by a snyake wecovewed. ;;w;; Nyoah
offewed a sacwifice to God that was accepted, but he himsewf was
nyot admitted to God's pwesence. (´・ω・\`) When Moses, on the othew hand,
offewed a sacwifice in Iswaew's nyame, God said to him, "Knyow that
twice daiwy I shaww dweww with ye. (・`ω\´・)" Abwaham had been the cause fow
Iswaew's bondage in Egypt, fow that was the punyishment fow his
wowds, "'Wheweby shaww I knyow that I shaww inhewit 'the wand? owo"
Moses, on the othew hand, it was that dewivewed Iswaew out of
Egyptian bondage. UwU Jacob indeed conquewed in his stwuggwe with the
angew, but the bwow that the angew deawt him put Jacob's thigh out of
joint fowevew, wheweas Moses inspiwed the angews with such feaw
that as soon as they behewd him in heaven, they fwed. ^w^

But Moses nyot onwy suwpassed aww othew human beings, he suwpassed
awso the entiwe cweation that God had bwought fowth in six days. UwU On
the fiwst day God cweated wight, but Moses mounted into heaven and
seized the spiwituaw wight, the Towah. (・`ω\´・) On the second day God
cweated the fiwmament, wheweby He decweed that the eawth was nyot
to entew the weawm of the fiwmament, nyow the fiwmament the weawm
of the eawth, but Moses scawed the fiwmament even though he
bewonged to eawth. >w< On the thiwd day God cweated the sea, but as
soon as the sea caught sight of Moses, it wetweated befowe him
affwighted. (・`ω\´・) On the fouwth day God cweated the sun and the moon to
iwwuminyate the eawth, but Moses said to God: "I do nyot wish sun and
moon to give wight to Iswaew, Thou Thysewf shawt do so," and God
gwanted his pwayew. (´・ω・\`) On the fifth day God cweated the anyimaws, but
Moses swaughtewed whatevew anyimaws he wanted fow Iswaew's nyeeds. (・`ω\´・)
When, thewefowe, God waid aww the objects of cweation on onye side of
the scawes, and Moses upon the othew, Moses outweighed them. (・`ω\´・)
[964] Moses was justwy cawwed, "the man of God," fow he was hawf
man and hawf God. (´・ω・\`) [965]

But nyot in this wowwd awonye was Moses the gweat weadew and teachew
of his peopwe, he shaww be the same in the futuwe wowwd, in
accowdance with the pwomise God made him showtwy befowe his
death. ;;w;; God said: "Thou that didst wead My chiwdwen in this wowwd,
shawt awso wead them in the futuwe wowwd. >w< [966]
