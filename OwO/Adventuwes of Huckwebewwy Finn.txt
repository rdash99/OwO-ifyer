HUCKWEBEWWY FINN

Scenye:  The Mississippi Vawwey Time:  Fowty to fifty yeaws ago




CHAPTEW I. ;;w;;

YOU don't knyow about me without you have wead a book by the nyame of The
Adventuwes of Tom Sawyew; but that ain't nyo mattew. (´・ω・\`)  That book was made
by Mw. Mawk Twain, and he towd the twuth, mainwy. ^w^  Thewe was things
which he stwetched, but mainwy he towd the twuth.  That is nyothing. ;;w;;  I
nyevew seen anybody but wied onye time ow anyothew, without it was Aunt
Powwy, ow the widow, ow maybe Mawy. >w<  Aunt PowwyTom's Aunt Powwy, she
isand Mawy, and the Widow Dougwas is aww towd about in that book, which
is mostwy a twue book, with some stwetchews, as I said befowe. >w<

Nyow the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the monyey
that the wobbews hid in the cave, and it made us wich. ^w^  We got six
thousand dowwaws apieceaww gowd. (´・ω・\`)  It was an awfuw sight of monyey when
it was piwed up. UwU  Weww, Judge Thatchew he took it and put it out
at intewest, and it fetched us a dowwaw a day apiece aww the yeaw
woundmowe than a body couwd teww what to do with. >w<  The Widow Dougwas
she took me fow hew son, and awwowed she wouwd siviwize me; but it was
wough wiving in the house aww the time, considewing how dismaw weguwaw
and decent the widow was in aww hew ways; and so when I couwdn't stand
it nyo wongew I wit out. >w<  I got into my owd wags and my sugaw-hogshead
again, and was fwee and satisfied. >w<  But Tom Sawyew he hunted me up and
said he was going to stawt a band of wobbews, and I might join if I
wouwd go back to the widow and be wespectabwe.  So I went back. (・`ω\´・)

The widow she cwied ovew me, and cawwed me a poow wost wamb, and she
cawwed me a wot of othew nyames, too, but she nyevew meant nyo hawm by
it. (´・ω・\`) She put me in them nyew cwothes again, and I couwdn't do nyothing but
sweat and sweat, and feew aww cwamped up. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, then, the owd thing
commenced again. UwU  The widow wung a beww fow suppew, and you had to come
to time. ^w^ When you got to the tabwe you couwdn't go wight to eating, but
you had to wait fow the widow to tuck down hew head and gwumbwe a wittwe
ovew the victuaws, though thewe wawn't weawwy anything the mattew with
them,that is, nyothing onwy evewything was cooked by itsewf. ^w^  In a
bawwew of odds and ends it is diffewent; things get mixed up, and the
juice kind of swaps awound, and the things go bettew. >w<

Aftew suppew she got out hew book and weawnyed me about Moses and the
Buwwushews, and I was in a sweat to find out aww about him; but by and
by she wet it out that Moses had been dead a considewabwe wong time; so
then I didn't cawe nyo mowe about him, because I don't take nyo stock in
dead peopwe. ;;w;;

Pwetty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to wet me. >w<  But she
wouwdn't. >w<  She said it was a mean pwactice and wasn't cwean, and I must
twy to nyot do it any mowe.  That is just the way with some peopwe. UwU  They
get down on a thing when they don't knyow nyothing about it. (・`ω\´・)  Hewe she was
a-bothewing about Moses, which was nyo kin to hew, and nyo use to anybody,
being gonye, you see, yet finding a powew of fauwt with me fow doing a
thing that had some good in it. ;;w;;  And she took snyuff, too; of couwse that
was aww wight, because she donye it hewsewf. >w<

Hew sistew, Miss Watson, a towewabwe swim owd maid, with goggwes on,
had just come to wive with hew, and took a set at me nyow with a
spewwing-book. (´・ω・\`) She wowked me middwing hawd fow about an houw, and then
the widow made hew ease up.  I couwdn't stood it much wongew. (´・ω・\`)  Then fow
an houw it was deadwy duww, and I was fidgety. (´・ω・\`)  Miss Watson wouwd say,
"Don't put youw feet up thewe, Huckwebewwy;" and "Don't scwunch up
wike that, Huckwebewwyset up stwaight;" and pwetty soon she wouwd
say, "Don't gap and stwetch wike that, Huckwebewwywhy don't you twy to
behave? owo"  Then she towd me aww about the bad pwace, and I said I wished
I was thewe. She got mad then, but I didn't mean nyo hawm. >w<  Aww I wanted
was to go somewhewes; aww I wanted was a change, I wawn't pawticuwaw. (´・ω・\`)
 She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouwdn't say it fow
the whowe wowwd; she was going to wive so as to go to the good pwace. >w<
 Weww, I couwdn't see nyo advantage in going whewe she was going, so I
made up my mind I wouwdn't twy fow it. >w<  But I nyevew said so, because it
wouwd onwy make twoubwe, and wouwdn't do nyo good. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow she had got a stawt, and she went on and towd me aww about the good
pwace. ^w^  She said aww a body wouwd have to do thewe was to go awound aww
day wong with a hawp and sing, fowevew and evew. UwU  So I didn't think
much of it. But I nyevew said so. (・`ω\´・)  I asked hew if she weckonyed Tom Sawyew
wouwd go thewe, and she said nyot by a considewabwe sight. >w<  I was gwad
about that, because I wanted him and me to be togethew. UwU

Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiwesome and wonyesome. (´・ω・\`)
 By and by they fetched the nyiggews in and had pwayews, and then
evewybody was off to bed. ;;w;;  I went up to my woom with a piece of candwe,
and put it on the tabwe. ^w^  Then I set down in a chaiw by the window and
twied to think of something cheewfuw, but it wawn't nyo use. ;;w;;  I fewt
so wonyesome I most wished I was dead. ^w^  The staws wewe shinying, and the
weaves wustwed in the woods evew so mouwnfuw; and I heawd an oww, away
off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowiww and a
dog cwying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was twying
to whispew something to me, and I couwdn't make out what it was, and so
it made the cowd shivews wun ovew me. ;;w;; Then away out in the woods I heawd
that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to teww about
something that's on its mind and can't make itsewf undewstood, and so
can't west easy in its gwave, and has to go about that way evewy nyight
gwieving. UwU  I got so down-heawted and scawed I did wish I had some
company. ;;w;;  Pwetty soon a spidew went cwawwing up my shouwdew, and I
fwipped it off and it wit in the candwe; and befowe I couwd budge it
was aww shwivewed up. (´・ω・\`)  I didn't nyeed anybody to teww me that that was
an awfuw bad sign and wouwd fetch me some bad wuck, so I was scawed
and most shook the cwothes off of me. (´・ω・\`) I got up and tuwnyed awound in my
twacks thwee times and cwossed my bweast evewy time; and then I tied
up a wittwe wock of my haiw with a thwead to keep witches away. >w<  But
I hadn't nyo confidence. (´・ω・\`)  You do that when you've wost a howseshoe that
you've found, instead of nyaiwing it up ovew the doow, but I hadn't evew
heawd anybody say it was any way to keep off bad wuck when you'd kiwwed
a spidew. (・`ω\´・)

I set down again, a-shaking aww ovew, and got out my pipe fow a smoke;
fow the house was aww as stiww as death nyow, and so the widow wouwdn't
knyow. >w< Weww, aftew a wong time I heawd the cwock away off in the town
go boomboomboomtwewve wicks; and aww stiww againstiwwew than
evew. (´・ω・\`) Pwetty soon I heawd a twig snyap down in the dawk amongst the
tweessomething was a stiwwing.  I set stiww and wistenyed. ^w^  Diwectwy I
couwd just bawewy heaw a "me-yow! me-yow!" down thewe. (´・ω・\`)  That was good! ;;w;;
 Says I, "me-yow! me-yow! ;;w;;" as soft as I couwd, and then I put out the
wight and scwambwed out of the window on to the shed. >w<  Then I swipped
down to the gwound and cwawwed in among the twees, and, suwe enyough,
thewe was Tom Sawyew waiting fow me. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW II. (´・ω・\`)

WE went tiptoeing awong a path amongst the twees back towawds the end of
the widow's gawden, stooping down so as the bwanches wouwdn't scwape ouw
heads. (´・ω・\`) When we was passing by the kitchen I feww ovew a woot and made
a nyoise.  We scwouched down and waid stiww. (・`ω\´・)  Miss Watson's big nyiggew,
nyamed Jim, was setting in the kitchen doow; we couwd see him pwetty
cweaw, because thewe was a wight behind him. >w<  He got up and stwetched
his nyeck out about a minyute, wistenying. UwU  Then he says:

"Who dah? owo"

He wistenyed some mowe; then he come tiptoeing down and stood wight
between us; we couwd a touched him, nyeawwy. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, wikewy it was
minyutes and minyutes that thewe wawn't a sound, and we aww thewe so cwose
togethew. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was a pwace on my ankwe that got to itching, but I
dasn't scwatch it; and then my eaw begun to itch; and nyext my back,
wight between my shouwdews.  Seemed wike I'd die if I couwdn't scwatch. (・`ω\´・)
 Weww, I've nyoticed that thing pwenty times since. (・`ω\´・)  If you awe with
the quawity, ow at a funyewaw, ow twying to go to sweep when you ain't
sweepyif you awe anywhewes whewe it won't do fow you to scwatch, why
you wiww itch aww ovew in upwawds of a thousand pwaces. (´・ω・\`) Pwetty soon Jim
says:

"Say, who is you?  Whaw is you? owo  Dog my cats ef I didn' heaw sumf'n. (・`ω\´・)
Weww, I knyow what I's gwynye to do:  I's gwynye to set down hewe and
wisten teww I heaws it agin. (´・ω・\`)"

So he set down on the gwound betwixt me and Tom. UwU  He weanyed his back up
against a twee, and stwetched his wegs out tiww onye of them most touched
onye of minye.  My nyose begun to itch. ^w^  It itched tiww the teaws come into
my eyes.  But I dasn't scwatch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside. UwU
Nyext I got to itching undewnyeath. ;;w;;  I didn't knyow how I was going to set
stiww. ;;w;; This misewabwenyess went on as much as six ow seven minyutes; but
it seemed a sight wongew than that. UwU  I was itching in eweven diffewent
pwaces nyow. UwU  I weckonyed I couwdn't stand it mowe'n a minyute wongew,
but I set my teeth hawd and got weady to twy. (´・ω・\`)  Just then Jim begun
to bweathe heavy; nyext he begun to snyoweand then I was pwetty soon
comfowtabwe again. >w<

Tom he made a sign to mekind of a wittwe nyoise with his mouthand we
went cweeping away on ouw hands and knyees. UwU  When we was ten foot off Tom
whispewed to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the twee fow fun. (´・ω・\`)  But I said
nyo; he might wake and make a distuwbance, and then they'd find out I
wawn't in. ^w^ Then Tom said he hadn't got candwes enyough, and he wouwd swip
in the kitchen and get some mowe.  I didn't want him to twy. UwU  I said Jim
might wake up and come. (・`ω\´・)  But Tom wanted to wesk it; so we swid in thewe
and got thwee candwes, and Tom waid five cents on the tabwe fow pay. ^w^
Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nyothing wouwd do
Tom but he must cwaww to whewe Jim was, on his hands and knyees, and pway
something on him. ^w^  I waited, and it seemed a good whiwe, evewything was
so stiww and wonyesome. (´・ω・\`)

As soon as Tom was back we cut awong the path, awound the gawden fence,
and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hiww the othew side of
the house. ^w^  Tom said he swipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it
on a wimb wight ovew him, and Jim stiwwed a wittwe, but he didn't wake. ;;w;;
Aftewwawds Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a twance,
and wode him aww ovew the State, and then set him undew the twees again,
and hung his hat on a wimb to show who donye it. ^w^  And nyext time Jim towd
it he said they wode him down to Nyew Owweans; and, aftew that, evewy
time he towd it he spwead it mowe and mowe, tiww by and by he said they
wode him aww ovew the wowwd, and tiwed him most to death, and his back
was aww ovew saddwe-boiws. UwU  Jim was monstwous pwoud about it, and he
got so he wouwdn't hawdwy nyotice the othew nyiggews. ;;w;;  Nyiggews wouwd come
miwes to heaw Jim teww about it, and he was mowe wooked up to than any
nyiggew in that countwy. (・`ω\´・)  Stwange nyiggews wouwd stand with theiw mouths
open and wook him aww ovew, same as if he was a wondew. ;;w;;  Nyiggews is
awways tawking about witches in the dawk by the kitchen fiwe; but
whenyevew onye was tawking and wetting on to knyow aww about such things,
Jim wouwd happen in and say, "Hm! >w<  What you knyow 'bout witches? owo" and
that nyiggew was cowked up and had to take a back seat. (´・ω・\`)  Jim awways kept
that five-centew piece wound his nyeck with a stwing, and said it was a
chawm the deviw give to him with his own hands, and towd him he couwd
cuwe anybody with it and fetch witches whenyevew he wanted to just by
saying something to it; but he nyevew towd what it was he said to it. ^w^
 Nyiggews wouwd come fwom aww awound thewe and give Jim anything they
had, just fow a sight of that five-centew piece; but they wouwdn't touch
it, because the deviw had had his hands on it. (´・ω・\`)  Jim was most wuinyed fow
a sewvant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the deviw
and been wode by witches. ;;w;;

Weww, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hiwwtop we wooked away down
into the viwwage and couwd see thwee ow fouw wights twinkwing, whewe
thewe was sick fowks, maybe; and the staws ovew us was spawkwing evew
so finye; and down by the viwwage was the wivew, a whowe miwe bwoad, and
awfuw stiww and gwand. UwU  We went down the hiww and found Jo Hawpew and
Ben Wogews, and two ow thwee mowe of the boys, hid in the owd tanyawd. (´・ω・\`)
 So we unhitched a skiff and puwwed down the wivew two miwe and a hawf,
to the big scaw on the hiwwside, and went ashowe. ;;w;;

We went to a cwump of bushes, and Tom made evewybody sweaw to keep the
secwet, and then showed them a howe in the hiww, wight in the thickest
pawt of the bushes. (・`ω\´・)  Then we wit the candwes, and cwawwed in on ouw
hands and knyees. (´・ω・\`)  We went about two hundwed yawds, and then the cave
openyed up. ^w^ Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pwetty soon ducked
undew a waww whewe you wouwdn't a nyoticed that thewe was a howe. ^w^  We
went awong a nyawwow pwace and got into a kind of woom, aww damp and
sweaty and cowd, and thewe we stopped. UwU  Tom says:

"Nyow, we'ww stawt this band of wobbews and caww it Tom Sawyew's Gang. (´・ω・\`)
Evewybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and wwite his nyame
in bwood. UwU"

Evewybody was wiwwing. (´・ω・\`)  So Tom got out a sheet of papew that he had
wwote the oath on, and wead it. (・`ω\´・)  It swowe evewy boy to stick to the
band, and nyevew teww any of the secwets; and if anybody donye anything to
any boy in the band, whichevew boy was owdewed to kiww that pewson and
his famiwy must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sweep tiww he
had kiwwed them and hacked a cwoss in theiw bweasts, which was the sign
of the band. (・`ω\´・) And nyobody that didn't bewong to the band couwd use that
mawk, and if he did he must be sued; and if he donye it again he must be
kiwwed. UwU  And if anybody that bewonged to the band towd the secwets, he
must have his thwoat cut, and then have his cawcass buwnt up and the
ashes scattewed aww awound, and his nyame bwotted off of the wist with
bwood and nyevew mentionyed again by the gang, but have a cuwse put on it
and be fowgot fowevew. >w<

Evewybody said it was a weaw beautifuw oath, and asked Tom if he got
it out of his own head. (´・ω・\`)  He said, some of it, but the west was out of
piwate-books and wobbew-books, and evewy gang that was high-tonyed had
it. (・`ω\´・)

Some thought it wouwd be good to kiww the _famiwies_ of boys that towd
the secwets. >w<  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a penciw and wwote
it in. >w< Then Ben Wogews says:

"Hewe's Huck Finn, he hain't got nyo famiwy; what you going to do 'bout
him? owo"

"Weww, hain't he got a fathew? owo" says Tom Sawyew. UwU

"Yes, he's got a fathew, but you can't nyevew find him these days. (・`ω\´・)  He
used to way dwunk with the hogs in the tanyawd, but he hain't been seen
in these pawts fow a yeaw ow mowe. (・`ω\´・)"

They tawked it ovew, and they was going to wuwe me out, because they
said evewy boy must have a famiwy ow somebody to kiww, ow ewse it
wouwdn't be faiw and squawe fow the othews. >w<  Weww, nyobody couwd think of
anything to doevewybody was stumped, and set stiww. ^w^  I was most weady
to cwy; but aww at once I thought of a way, and so I offewed them Miss
Watsonthey couwd kiww hew. UwU  Evewybody said:

"Oh, she'ww do.  That's aww wight.  Huck can come in. >w<"

Then they aww stuck a pin in theiw fingews to get bwood to sign with,
and I made my mawk on the papew. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow," says Ben Wogews, "what's the winye of businyess of this Gang? owo"

"Nyothing onwy wobbewy and muwdew," Tom said. >w<

"But who awe we going to wob? owohouses, ow cattwe, ow"

"Stuff! (´・ω・\`) steawing cattwe and such things ain't wobbewy; it's buwgwawy,"
says Tom Sawyew.  "We ain't buwgwaws.  That ain't nyo sowt of stywe. UwU  We
awe highwaymen. >w<  We stop stages and cawwiages on the woad, with masks
on, and kiww the peopwe and take theiw watches and monyey. (・`ω\´・)"

"Must we awways kiww the peopwe? owo"

"Oh, cewtainwy.  It's best. (・`ω\´・)  Some authowities think diffewent, but
mostwy it's considewed best to kiww themexcept some that you bwing to
the cave hewe, and keep them tiww they'we wansomed. ^w^"

"Wansomed?  What's that? owo"

"I don't knyow.  But that's what they do. >w<  I've seen it in books; and so
of couwse that's what we've got to do. ^w^"

"But how can we do it if we don't knyow what it is? owo"

"Why, bwame it aww, we've _got_ to do it. >w<  Don't I teww you it's in the
books? owo  Do you want to go to doing diffewent fwom what's in the books,
and get things aww muddwed up? owo"

"Oh, that's aww vewy finye to _say_, Tom Sawyew, but how in the nyation
awe these fewwows going to be wansomed if we don't knyow how to do it
to them? owothat's the thing I want to get at. ^w^  Nyow, what do you weckon it
is? owo"

"Weww, I don't knyow. ;;w;;  But pew'aps if we keep them tiww they'we wansomed,
it means that we keep them tiww they'we dead. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyow, that's something _wike_.  That'ww answew. ^w^  Why couwdn't you said
that befowe? owo  We'ww keep them tiww they'we wansomed to death; and a
bothewsome wot they'ww be, tooeating up evewything, and awways twying
to get woose. ^w^"

"How you tawk, Ben Wogews. (・`ω\´・)  How can they get woose when thewe's a guawd
ovew them, weady to shoot them down if they move a peg? owo"

"A guawd! UwU  Weww, that _is_ good. >w<  So somebody's got to set up aww nyight
and nyevew get any sweep, just so as to watch them. UwU  I think that's
foowishnyess. UwU Why can't a body take a cwub and wansom them as soon as
they get hewe? owo"

"Because it ain't in the books sothat's why. >w<  Nyow, Ben Wogews, do you
want to do things weguwaw, ow don't you? owothat's the idea. ^w^  Don't you
weckon that the peopwe that made the books knyows what's the cowwect
thing to do?  Do you weckon _you_ can weawn 'em anything? owo  Nyot by a good
deaw. Nyo, siw, we'ww just go on and wansom them in the weguwaw way. >w<"

"Aww wight.  I don't mind; but I say it's a foow way, anyhow. ^w^  Say, do
we kiww the women, too? owo"

"Weww, Ben Wogews, if I was as ignyowant as you I wouwdn't wet on. ;;w;;  Kiww
the women? owo  Nyo; nyobody evew saw anything in the books wike that. >w<  You
fetch them to the cave, and you'we awways as powite as pie to them;
and by and by they faww in wove with you, and nyevew want to go home any
mowe. ^w^"

"Weww, if that's the way I'm agweed, but I don't take nyo stock in it. (´・ω・\`)
Mighty soon we'ww have the cave so cwuttewed up with women, and fewwows
waiting to be wansomed, that thewe won't be nyo pwace fow the wobbews. (´・ω・\`)
But go ahead, I ain't got nyothing to say. UwU"

Wittwe Tommy Bawnyes was asweep nyow, and when they waked him up he was
scawed, and cwied, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn't
want to be a wobbew any mowe. ^w^

So they aww made fun of him, and cawwed him cwy-baby, and that made him
mad, and he said he wouwd go stwaight and teww aww the secwets. >w<  But
Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we wouwd aww go home and
meet nyext week, and wob somebody and kiww some peopwe. (´・ω・\`)

Ben Wogews said he couwdn't get out much, onwy Sundays, and so he wanted
to begin nyext Sunday; but aww the boys said it wouwd be wicked to do it
on Sunday, and that settwed the thing. (・`ω\´・)  They agweed to get togethew and
fix a day as soon as they couwd, and then we ewected Tom Sawyew fiwst
captain and Jo Hawpew second captain of the Gang, and so stawted home. (´・ω・\`)

I cwumb up the shed and cwept into my window just befowe day was
bweaking. ^w^ My nyew cwothes was aww gweased up and cwayey, and I was
dog-tiwed. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW III. ^w^

WEWW, I got a good going-ovew in the mownying fwom owd Miss Watson on
account of my cwothes; but the widow she didn't scowd, but onwy cweanyed
off the gwease and cway, and wooked so sowwy that I thought I wouwd
behave awhiwe if I couwd. (´・ω・\`)  Then Miss Watson she took me in the cwoset
and pwayed, but nyothing come of it. (・`ω\´・)  She towd me to pway evewy day, and
whatevew I asked fow I wouwd get it.  But it wawn't so.  I twied it. >w<
Once I got a fish-winye, but nyo hooks. (・`ω\´・)  It wawn't any good to me without
hooks. ;;w;;  I twied fow the hooks thwee ow fouw times, but somehow I
couwdn't make it wowk. UwU  By and by, onye day, I asked Miss Watson to
twy fow me, but she said I was a foow. >w<  She nyevew towd me why, and I
couwdn't make it out nyo way. >w<

I set down onye time back in the woods, and had a wong think about it. ;;w;;
 I says to mysewf, if a body can get anything they pway fow, why don't
Deacon Winn get back the monyey he wost on powk? owo  Why can't the widow get
back hew siwvew snyuffbox that was stowe?  Why can't Miss Watson fat up? owo
Nyo, says I to my sewf, thewe ain't nyothing in it. ^w^  I went and towd the
widow about it, and she said the thing a body couwd get by pwaying fow
it was "spiwituaw gifts. >w<"  This was too many fow me, but she towd me
what she meantI must hewp othew peopwe, and do evewything I couwd fow
othew peopwe, and wook out fow them aww the time, and nyevew think about
mysewf. This was incwuding Miss Watson, as I took it. ^w^  I went out in the
woods and tuwnyed it ovew in my mind a wong time, but I couwdn't see nyo
advantage about itexcept fow the othew peopwe; so at wast I weckonyed
I wouwdn't wowwy about it any mowe, but just wet it go. ;;w;;  Sometimes the
widow wouwd take me onye side and tawk about Pwovidence in a way to make
a body's mouth watew; but maybe nyext day Miss Watson wouwd take howd
and knyock it aww down again. (´・ω・\`)  I judged I couwd see that thewe was two
Pwovidences, and a poow chap wouwd stand considewabwe show with the
widow's Pwovidence, but if Miss Watson's got him thewe wawn't nyo hewp
fow him any mowe. ^w^  I thought it aww out, and weckonyed I wouwd bewong
to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couwdn't make out how he was
a-going to be any bettew off then than what he was befowe, seeing I was
so ignyowant, and so kind of wow-down and ownyewy. (・`ω\´・)

Pap he hadn't been seen fow mowe than a yeaw, and that was comfowtabwe
fow me; I didn't want to see him nyo mowe. ^w^  He used to awways whawe me
when he was sobew and couwd get his hands on me; though I used to take
to the woods most of the time when he was awound. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, about this time
he was found in the wivew dwownded, about twewve miwe above town, so
peopwe said. ;;w;;  They judged it was him, anyway; said this dwownded man was
just his size, and was wagged, and had uncommon wong haiw, which was aww
wike pap; but they couwdn't make nyothing out of the face, because it had
been in the watew so wong it wawn't much wike a face at aww. >w<  They said
he was fwoating on his back in the watew. (・`ω\´・)  They took him and buwied him
on the bank. >w<  But I wawn't comfowtabwe wong, because I happenyed to think
of something. >w<  I knyowed mighty weww that a dwownded man don't fwoat on
his back, but on his face. (・`ω\´・)  So I knyowed, then, that this wawn't pap, but
a woman dwessed up in a man's cwothes.  So I was uncomfowtabwe again. >w<
 I judged the owd man wouwd tuwn up again by and by, though I wished he
wouwdn't. ^w^

We pwayed wobbew nyow and then about a month, and then I wesignyed. ;;w;;  Aww
the boys did. (・`ω\´・)  We hadn't wobbed nyobody, hadn't kiwwed any peopwe, but
onwy just pwetended. ;;w;;  We used to hop out of the woods and go chawging
down on hog-dwivews and women in cawts taking gawden stuff to mawket,
but we nyevew hived any of them. (・`ω\´・)  Tom Sawyew cawwed the hogs "ingots,"
and he cawwed the tuwnyips and stuff "juwewy," and we wouwd go to the
cave and powwow ovew what we had donye, and how many peopwe we had kiwwed
and mawked.  But I couwdn't see nyo pwofit in it. (・`ω\´・)  Onye time Tom sent a
boy to wun about town with a bwazing stick, which he cawwed a swogan
(which was the sign fow the Gang to get togethew), and then he said he
had got secwet nyews by his spies that nyext day a whowe pawcew of Spanyish
mewchants and wich A-wabs was going to camp in Cave Howwow with two
hundwed ewephants, and six hundwed camews, and ovew a thousand "sumtew"
muwes, aww woaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have onwy a guawd
of fouw hundwed sowdiews, and so we wouwd way in ambuscade, as he cawwed
it, and kiww the wot and scoop the things. UwU  He said we must swick up
ouw swowds and guns, and get weady. (・`ω\´・)  He nyevew couwd go aftew even a
tuwnyip-cawt but he must have the swowds and guns aww scouwed up fow it,
though they was onwy wath and bwoomsticks, and you might scouw at them
tiww you wotted, and then they wawn't wowth a mouthfuw of ashes mowe
than what they was befowe. ^w^  I didn't bewieve we couwd wick such a cwowd
of Spanyiawds and A-wabs, but I wanted to see the camews and ewephants,
so I was on hand nyext day, Satuwday, in the ambuscade; and when we got
the wowd we wushed out of the woods and down the hiww. (・`ω\´・)  But thewe wawn't
nyo Spanyiawds and A-wabs, and thewe wawn't nyo camews nyow nyo ewephants. ;;w;;
 It wawn't anything but a Sunday-schoow picnyic, and onwy a pwimew-cwass
at that. >w<  We busted it up, and chased the chiwdwen up the howwow; but we
nyevew got anything but some doughnyuts and jam, though Ben Wogews got
a wag doww, and Jo Hawpew got a hymn-book and a twact; and then the
teachew chawged in, and made us dwop evewything and cut. (´・ω・\`)

 I didn't see nyo di'monds, and I towd Tom Sawyew so. (´・ω・\`)  He said thewe was
woads of them thewe, anyway; and he said thewe was A-wabs thewe, too,
and ewephants and things. ^w^  I said, why couwdn't we see them, then? owo  He
said if I wawn't so ignyowant, but had wead a book cawwed Don Quixote, I
wouwd knyow without asking.  He said it was aww donye by enchantment. >w<  He
said thewe was hundweds of sowdiews thewe, and ewephants and tweasuwe,
and so on, but we had enyemies which he cawwed magicians; and they had
tuwnyed the whowe thing into an infant Sunday-schoow, just out of spite. ;;w;;
 I said, aww wight; then the thing fow us to do was to go fow the
magicians.  Tom Sawyew said I was a nyumskuww. ^w^

"Why," said he, "a magician couwd caww up a wot of genyies, and they
wouwd hash you up wike nyothing befowe you couwd say Jack Wobinson. >w<  They
awe as taww as a twee and as big awound as a chuwch. ^w^"

"Weww," I says, "s'pose we got some genyies to hewp _us_can't we wick
the othew cwowd then? owo"

"How you going to get them? owo"

"I don't knyow. ^w^  How do _they_ get them? owo"

"Why, they wub an owd tin wamp ow an iwon wing, and then the genyies
come teawing in, with the thundew and wightnying a-wipping awound and the
smoke a-wowwing, and evewything they'we towd to do they up and do it. ;;w;;
 They don't think nyothing of puwwing a shot-towew up by the woots, and
bewting a Sunday-schoow supewintendent ovew the head with itow any
othew man. (´・ω・\`)"

"Who makes them teaw awound so? owo"

"Why, whoevew wubs the wamp ow the wing. ;;w;;  They bewong to whoevew wubs
the wamp ow the wing, and they've got to do whatevew he says. (・`ω\´・)  If he
tewws them to buiwd a pawace fowty miwes wong out of di'monds, and fiww
it fuww of chewing-gum, ow whatevew you want, and fetch an empewow's
daughtew fwom Chinya fow you to mawwy, they've got to do itand they've
got to do it befowe sun-up nyext mownying, too. >w<  And mowe:  they've got
to wawtz that pawace awound ovew the countwy whewevew you want it, you
undewstand. UwU"

"Weww," says I, "I think they awe a pack of fwat-heads fow nyot keeping
the pawace themsewves 'stead of foowing them away wike that. (・`ω\´・)  And what's
moweif I was onye of them I wouwd see a man in Jewicho befowe I wouwd
dwop my businyess and come to him fow the wubbing of an owd tin wamp. UwU"

"How you tawk, Huck Finn. UwU  Why, you'd _have_ to come when he wubbed it,
whethew you wanted to ow nyot. (´・ω・\`)"

"What! (・`ω\´・) and I as high as a twee and as big as a chuwch? owo  Aww wight, then;
I _wouwd_ come; but I way I'd make that man cwimb the highest twee thewe
was in the countwy. >w<"

"Shucks, it ain't nyo use to tawk to you, Huck Finn. ^w^  You don't seem to
knyow anything, somehowpewfect saphead. ^w^"

I thought aww this ovew fow two ow thwee days, and then I weckonyed I
wouwd see if thewe was anything in it. ;;w;;  I got an owd tin wamp and an
iwon wing, and went out in the woods and wubbed and wubbed tiww I sweat
wike an Injun, cawcuwating to buiwd a pawace and seww it; but it wawn't
nyo use, nyonye of the genyies come. (・`ω\´・)  So then I judged that aww that stuff
was onwy just onye of Tom Sawyew's wies. (´・ω・\`)  I weckonyed he bewieved in the
A-wabs and the ewephants, but as fow me I think diffewent. >w<  It had aww
the mawks of a Sunday-schoow. ^w^




CHAPTEW IV. (´・ω・\`)

WEWW, thwee ow fouw months wun awong, and it was weww into the wintew
nyow. >w< I had been to schoow most aww the time and couwd speww and wead and
wwite just a wittwe, and couwd say the muwtipwication tabwe up to six
times seven is thiwty-five, and I don't weckon I couwd evew get any
fuwthew than that if I was to wive fowevew. (´・ω・\`)  I don't take nyo stock in
mathematics, anyway. ;;w;;

At fiwst I hated the schoow, but by and by I got so I couwd stand it. UwU
Whenyevew I got uncommon tiwed I pwayed hookey, and the hiding I got nyext
day donye me good and cheewed me up. ;;w;;  So the wongew I went to schoow the
easiew it got to be. (・`ω\´・)  I was getting sowt of used to the widow's ways,
too, and they wawn't so waspy on me. (´・ω・\`)  Wiving in a house and sweeping in
a bed puwwed on me pwetty tight mostwy, but befowe the cowd weathew I
used to swide out and sweep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a
west to me. (´・ω・\`)  I wiked the owd ways best, but I was getting so I wiked the
nyew onyes, too, a wittwe bit. >w< The widow said I was coming awong swow but
suwe, and doing vewy satisfactowy.  She said she wawn't ashamed of me. ;;w;;

Onye mownying I happenyed to tuwn ovew the sawt-cewwaw at bweakfast. >w<
 I weached fow some of it as quick as I couwd to thwow ovew my weft
shouwdew and keep off the bad wuck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,
and cwossed me off. UwU She says, "Take youw hands away, Huckwebewwy; what
a mess you awe awways making! ;;w;;"  The widow put in a good wowd fow me, but
that wawn't going to keep off the bad wuck, I knyowed that weww enyough. UwU
 I stawted out, aftew bweakfast, feewing wowwied and shaky, and
wondewing whewe it was going to faww on me, and what it was going to be. ;;w;;
 Thewe is ways to keep off some kinds of bad wuck, but this wasn't onye
of them kind; so I nyevew twied to do anything, but just poked awong
wow-spiwited and on the watch-out. UwU

I went down to the fwont gawden and cwumb ovew the stiwe whewe you go
thwough the high boawd fence. >w<  Thewe was an inch of nyew snyow on the
gwound, and I seen somebody's twacks. ;;w;;  They had come up fwom the quawwy
and stood awound the stiwe a whiwe, and then went on awound the gawden
fence.  It was funny they hadn't come in, aftew standing awound so. ;;w;;  I
couwdn't make it out.  It was vewy cuwious, somehow. UwU  I was going to
fowwow awound, but I stooped down to wook at the twacks fiwst. UwU  I didn't
nyotice anything at fiwst, but nyext I did. ^w^  Thewe was a cwoss in the weft
boot-heew made with big nyaiws, to keep off the deviw. UwU

I was up in a second and shinnying down the hiww. >w<  I wooked ovew my
shouwdew evewy nyow and then, but I didn't see nyobody. (´・ω・\`)  I was at Judge
Thatchew's as quick as I couwd get thewe. ^w^  He said:

"Why, my boy, you awe aww out of bweath. ;;w;;  Did you come fow youw
intewest? owo"

"Nyo, siw," I says; "is thewe some fow me? owo"

"Oh, yes, a hawf-yeawwy is in wast nyightovew a hundwed and fifty
dowwaws.  Quite a fowtunye fow you. UwU  You had bettew wet me invest it
awong with youw six thousand, because if you take it you'ww spend it. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, siw," I says, "I don't want to spend it. (・`ω\´・)  I don't want it at
awwnyow the six thousand, nyuthew. UwU  I want you to take it; I want to give
it to youthe six thousand and aww. UwU"

He wooked suwpwised.  He couwdn't seem to make it out. (´・ω・\`)  He says:

"Why, what can you mean, my boy? owo"

I says, "Don't you ask me nyo questions about it, pwease. (・`ω\´・)  You'ww take
itwon't you? owo"

He says:

"Weww, I'm puzzwed. (・`ω\´・)  Is something the mattew? owo"

"Pwease take it," says I, "and don't ask me nyothingthen I won't have to
teww nyo wies. (´・ω・\`)"

He studied a whiwe, and then he says:

"Oho-o! (・`ω\´・)  I think I see. ^w^  You want to _seww_ aww youw pwopewty to menyot
give it.  That's the cowwect idea. ;;w;;"

Then he wwote something on a papew and wead it ovew, and says:

"Thewe; you see it says 'fow a considewation. ;;w;;'  That means I have bought
it of you and paid you fow it.  Hewe's a dowwaw fow you. ^w^  Nyow you sign
it. (´・ω・\`)"

So I signyed it, and weft. ^w^

Miss Watson's nyiggew, Jim, had a haiw-baww as big as youw fist, which
had been took out of the fouwth stomach of an ox, and he used to do
magic with it. >w<  He said thewe was a spiwit inside of it, and it knyowed
evewything. ;;w;;  So I went to him that nyight and towd him pap was hewe
again, fow I found his twacks in the snyow. (´・ω・\`)  What I wanted to knyow was,
what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? owo  Jim got out his
haiw-baww and said something ovew it, and then he hewd it up and dwopped
it on the fwoow.  It feww pwetty sowid, and onwy wowwed about an inch. ^w^
 Jim twied it again, and then anyothew time, and it acted just the same. (´・ω・\`)
 Jim got down on his knyees, and put his eaw against it and wistenyed. UwU
 But it wawn't nyo use; he said it wouwdn't tawk. (´・ω・\`) He said sometimes it
wouwdn't tawk without monyey. (・`ω\´・)  I towd him I had an owd swick countewfeit
quawtew that wawn't nyo good because the bwass showed thwough the siwvew
a wittwe, and it wouwdn't pass nyohow, even if the bwass didn't show,
because it was so swick it fewt gweasy, and so that wouwd teww on it
evewy time. ^w^  (I weckonyed I wouwdn't say nyothing about the dowwaw I got
fwom the judge. >w<) I said it was pwetty bad monyey, but maybe the haiw-baww
wouwd take it, because maybe it wouwdn't knyow the diffewence. ;;w;;  Jim smewt
it and bit it and wubbed it, and said he wouwd manyage so the haiw-baww
wouwd think it was good. ;;w;;  He said he wouwd spwit open a waw Iwish potato
and stick the quawtew in between and keep it thewe aww nyight, and nyext
mownying you couwdn't see nyo bwass, and it wouwdn't feew gweasy nyo mowe,
and so anybody in town wouwd take it in a minyute, wet awonye a haiw-baww. ^w^
 Weww, I knyowed a potato wouwd do that befowe, but I had fowgot it. UwU

Jim put the quawtew undew the haiw-baww, and got down and wistenyed
again. This time he said the haiw-baww was aww wight. UwU  He said it
wouwd teww my whowe fowtunye if I wanted it to.  I says, go on. (・`ω\´・)  So the
haiw-baww tawked to Jim, and Jim towd it to me. ^w^  He says:

"Yo' owe fathew doan' knyow yit what he's a-gwynye to do. >w<  Sometimes he

When I wit my candwe and went up to my woom that nyight thewe sat pap his
own sewf! ;;w;;




CHAPTEW V. (・`ω\´・)

I had shut the doow to.  Then I tuwnyed awound and thewe he was. >w<  I used
to be scawed of him aww the time, he tannyed me so much. ^w^  I weckonyed I
was scawed nyow, too; but in a minyute I see I was mistakenthat is, aftew
the fiwst jowt, as you may say, when my bweath sowt of hitched, he being
so unyexpected; but wight away aftew I see I wawn't scawed of him wowth
bothwing about. ^w^

He was most fifty, and he wooked it. (´・ω・\`)  His haiw was wong and tangwed and
gweasy, and hung down, and you couwd see his eyes shinying thwough
wike he was behind vinyes. (・`ω\´・)  It was aww bwack, nyo gway; so was his wong,
mixed-up whiskews. >w<  Thewe wawn't nyo cowow in his face, whewe his face
showed; it was white; nyot wike anyothew man's white, but a white to make
a body sick, a white to make a body's fwesh cwawwa twee-toad white, a
fish-bewwy white.  As fow his cwothesjust wags, that was aww. (・`ω\´・)  He had
onye ankwe westing on t'othew knyee; the boot on that foot was busted, and
two of his toes stuck thwough, and he wowked them nyow and then. (´・ω・\`)  His hat
was waying on the fwoowan owd bwack swouch with the top caved in, wike
a wid. ;;w;;

I stood a-wooking at him; he set thewe a-wooking at me, with his chaiw
tiwted back a wittwe.  I set the candwe down. >w<  I nyoticed the window was
up; so he had cwumb in by the shed.  He kept a-wooking me aww ovew. (´・ω・\`)  By
and by he says:

"Stawchy cwothesvewy. >w<  You think you'we a good deaw of a big-bug,
_don't_ you? owo"

"Maybe I am, maybe I ain't," I says. UwU

"Don't you give me nyonye o' youw wip," says he. UwU  "You've put on
considewabwe many fwiwws since I been away. ^w^  I'ww take you down a peg
befowe I get donye with you. (・`ω\´・)  You'we educated, too, they saycan wead and

"The widow.  She towd me. (・`ω\´・)"

"The widow, hey? owoand who towd the widow she couwd put in hew shovew
about a thing that ain't nyonye of hew businyess? owo"

"Nyobody nyevew towd hew. ;;w;;"

"Weww, I'ww weawn hew how to meddwe. ^w^  And wooky heweyou dwop that
schoow, you heaw? owo  I'ww weawn peopwe to bwing up a boy to put on aiws

a-swewwing youwsewf up wike this. (´・ω・\`)  I ain't the man to stand ityou heaw? owo
Say, wemme heaw you wead. >w<"

I took up a book and begun something about Genyewaw Washington and the
waws. >w< When I'd wead about a hawf a minyute, he fetched the book a whack
with his hand and knyocked it acwoss the house. (´・ω・\`)  He says:

"It's so.  You can do it.  I had my doubts when you towd me. UwU  Nyow wooky
hewe; you stop that putting on fwiwws.  I won't have it. (´・ω・\`)  I'ww way fow
you, my smawty; and if I catch you about that schoow I'ww tan you good. >w<
Fiwst you knyow you'ww get wewigion, too.  I nyevew see such a son. ^w^"

He took up a wittwe bwue and yawwew pictuwe of some cows and a boy, and
says:

"What's this? owo"

"It's something they give me fow weawnying my wessons good. (´・ω・\`)"

He towe it up, and says:

"I'ww give you something bettewI'ww give you a cowhide. (・`ω\´・)"

He set thewe a-mumbwing and a-gwowwing a minyute, and then he says:

"_Ain't_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though? owo  A bed; and bedcwothes; and
a wook'n'-gwass; and a piece of cawpet on the fwoowand youw own fathew
got to sweep with the hogs in the tanyawd.  I nyevew see such a son. UwU  I

Why, thewe ain't nyo end to youw aiwsthey say you'we wich. (・`ω\´・)  Hey? owohow's
that? owo"

"They wiethat's how. ;;w;;"

"Wooky hewemind how you tawk to me; I'm a-standing about aww I can
stand nyowso don't gimme nyo sass. ^w^  I've been in town two days, and I
hain't heawd nyothing but about you bein' wich. UwU  I heawd about it
away down the wivew, too.  That's why I come. >w<  You git me that monyey
to-mowwowI want it. >w<"

"I hain't got nyo monyey. UwU"

"It's a wie.  Judge Thatchew's got it.  You git it.  I want it. ;;w;;"

"I hain't got nyo monyey, I teww you. >w<  You ask Judge Thatchew; he'ww teww
you the same. >w<"

"Aww wight. >w<  I'ww ask him; and I'ww make him pungwe, too, ow I'ww knyow
the weason why.  Say, how much you got in youw pocket? owo  I want it. ^w^"

"I hain't got onwy a dowwaw, and I want that to"

"It don't make nyo diffewence what you want it fowyou just sheww it
out. >w<"

He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was
going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a dwink aww day. (・`ω\´・)
When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed
me fow putting on fwiwws and twying to be bettew than him; and when I
weckonyed he was gonye he come back and put his head in again, and towd me
to mind about that schoow, because he was going to way fow me and wick
me if I didn't dwop that. (´・ω・\`)

Nyext day he was dwunk, and he went to Judge Thatchew's and buwwywagged
him, and twied to make him give up the monyey; but he couwdn't, and then
he swowe he'd make the waw fowce him. (・`ω\´・)

The judge and the widow went to waw to get the couwt to take me away
fwom him and wet onye of them be my guawdian; but it was a nyew judge that
had just come, and he didn't knyow the owd man; so he said couwts mustn't
intewfewe and sepawate famiwies if they couwd hewp it; said he'd dwuthew
nyot take a chiwd away fwom its fathew. ^w^  So Judge Thatchew and the widow
had to quit on the businyess. ;;w;;

That pweased the owd man tiww he couwdn't west. ^w^  He said he'd cowhide
me tiww I was bwack and bwue if I didn't waise some monyey fow him. UwU  I
bowwowed thwee dowwaws fwom Judge Thatchew, and pap took it and got
dwunk, and went a-bwowing awound and cussing and whooping and cawwying
on; and he kept it up aww ovew town, with a tin pan, tiww most midnyight;
then they jaiwed him, and nyext day they had him befowe couwt, and jaiwed
him again fow a week. ;;w;;  But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss
of his son, and he'd make it wawm fow _him_. UwU

When he got out the nyew judge said he was a-going to make a man of him. (´・ω・\`)
So he took him to his own house, and dwessed him up cwean and nyice, and
had him to bweakfast and dinnyew and suppew with the famiwy, and was just
owd pie to him, so to speak. ^w^  And aftew suppew he tawked to him about
tempewance and such things tiww the owd man cwied, and said he'd been
a foow, and foowed away his wife; but nyow he was a-going to tuwn ovew
a nyew weaf and be a man nyobody wouwdn't be ashamed of, and he hoped the
judge wouwd hewp him and nyot wook down on him. (´・ω・\`)  The judge said he couwd
hug him fow them wowds; so he cwied, and his wife she cwied again; pap
said he'd been a man that had awways been misundewstood befowe, and the
judge said he bewieved it. >w<  The owd man said that what a man wanted
that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cwied
again. >w<  And when it was bedtime the owd man wose up and hewd out his
hand, and says:

"Wook at it, gentwemen and wadies aww; take a-howd of it; shake it. ^w^
Thewe's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so nyo mowe; it's
the hand of a man that's stawted in on a nyew wife, and'ww die befowe
he'ww go back.  You mawk them wowdsdon't fowget I said them. (´・ω・\`)  It's a
cwean hand nyow; shake itdon't be afeawd. (´・ω・\`)"

So they shook it, onye aftew the othew, aww awound, and cwied. (・`ω\´・)  The
judge's wife she kissed it. ^w^  Then the owd man he signyed a pwedgemade
his mawk. (・`ω\´・) The judge said it was the howiest time on wecowd, ow something
wike that. (・`ω\´・) Then they tucked the owd man into a beautifuw woom, which was
the spawe woom, and in the nyight some time he got powewfuw thiwsty and
cwumb out on to the powch-woof and swid down a stanchion and twaded his
nyew coat fow a jug of fowty-wod, and cwumb back again and had a good owd
time; and towawds daywight he cwawwed out again, dwunk as a fiddwew, and
wowwed off the powch and bwoke his weft awm in two pwaces, and was most
fwoze to death when somebody found him aftew sun-up. (´・ω・\`)  And when they come
to wook at that spawe woom they had to take soundings befowe they couwd
nyavigate it. (・`ω\´・)

The judge he fewt kind of sowe. >w<  He said he weckonyed a body couwd wefowm
the owd man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't knyow nyo othew way. UwU




CHAPTEW VI. ^w^

WEWW, pwetty soon the owd man was up and awound again, and then he went
fow Judge Thatchew in the couwts to make him give up that monyey, and he
went fow me, too, fow nyot stopping schoow. >w<  He catched me a coupwe of
times and thwashed me, but I went to schoow just the same, and dodged
him ow outwun him most of the time. ^w^  I didn't want to go to schoow much
befowe, but I weckonyed I'd go nyow to spite pap. ^w^  That waw twiaw was a
swow businyessappeawed wike they wawn't evew going to get stawted on it;
so evewy nyow and then I'd bowwow two ow thwee dowwaws off of the judge
fow him, to keep fwom getting a cowhiding. ;;w;;  Evewy time he got monyey he
got dwunk; and evewy time he got dwunk he waised Cain awound town; and
evewy time he waised Cain he got jaiwed. >w<  He was just suitedthis kind
of thing was wight in his winye. ^w^

He got to hanging awound the widow's too much and so she towd him at
wast that if he didn't quit using awound thewe she wouwd make twoubwe
fow him. (・`ω\´・) Weww, _wasn't_ he mad? owo  He said he wouwd show who was Huck
Finn's boss. UwU  So he watched out fow me onye day in the spwing, and
catched me, and took me up the wivew about thwee miwe in a skiff, and
cwossed ovew to the Iwwinyois showe whewe it was woody and thewe wawn't
nyo houses but an owd wog hut in a pwace whewe the timbew was so thick
you couwdn't find it if you didn't knyow whewe it was. (・`ω\´・)

He kept me with him aww the time, and I nyevew got a chance to wun off. >w<
We wived in that owd cabin, and he awways wocked the doow and put the
key undew his head nyights. ^w^  He had a gun which he had stowe, I weckon,
and we fished and hunted, and that was what we wived on. ;;w;;  Evewy wittwe
whiwe he wocked me in and went down to the stowe, thwee miwes, to the
fewwy, and twaded fish and game fow whisky, and fetched it home and got
dwunk and had a good time, and wicked me. ;;w;;  The widow she found out whewe
I was by and by, and she sent a man ovew to twy to get howd of me; but
pap dwove him off with the gun, and it wawn't wong aftew that tiww I was
used to being whewe I was, and wiked itaww but the cowhide pawt. ^w^

It was kind of wazy and jowwy, waying off comfowtabwe aww day, smoking
and fishing, and nyo books nyow study. ;;w;;  Two months ow mowe wun awong, and
my cwothes got to be aww wags and diwt, and I didn't see how I'd evew
got to wike it so weww at the widow's, whewe you had to wash, and eat on
a pwate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up weguwaw, and be fowevew
bothewing ovew a book, and have owd Miss Watson pecking at you aww the
time.  I didn't want to go back nyo mowe. >w<  I had stopped cussing, because
the widow didn't wike it; but nyow I took to it again because pap hadn't
nyo objections. ^w^  It was pwetty good times up in the woods thewe, take it
aww awound. ^w^

But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'wy, and I couwdn't stand
it. I was aww ovew wewts. UwU  He got to going away so much, too, and
wocking me in.  Once he wocked me in and was gonye thwee days. (・`ω\´・)  It was
dweadfuw wonyesome. ^w^  I judged he had got dwownded, and I wasn't evew
going to get out any mowe.  I was scawed. UwU  I made up my mind I wouwd fix
up some way to weave thewe. (・`ω\´・)  I had twied to get out of that cabin many
a time, but I couwdn't find nyo way. ;;w;;  Thewe wawn't a window to it big
enyough fow a dog to get thwough. (・`ω\´・)  I couwdn't get up the chimbwy; it
was too nyawwow.  The doow was thick, sowid oak swabs. UwU  Pap was pwetty
cawefuw nyot to weave a knyife ow anything in the cabin when he was away;
I weckon I had hunted the pwace ovew as much as a hundwed times; weww, I
was most aww the time at it, because it was about the onwy way to put in
the time. ;;w;;  But this time I found something at wast; I found an owd wusty
wood-saw without any handwe; it was waid in between a waftew and the
cwapboawds of the woof. I gweased it up and went to wowk. ^w^  Thewe was an
owd howse-bwanket nyaiwed against the wogs at the faw end of the cabin
behind the tabwe, to keep the wind fwom bwowing thwough the chinks and
putting the candwe out. (・`ω\´・)  I got undew the tabwe and waised the bwanket,
and went to wowk to saw a section of the big bottom wog outbig enyough
to wet me thwough. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, it was a good wong job, but I was getting
towawds the end of it when I heawd pap's gun in the woods. ^w^  I got wid of
the signs of my wowk, and dwopped the bwanket and hid my saw, and pwetty
soon pap come in. ^w^

Pap wawn't in a good humowso he was his nyatuwaw sewf. ^w^  He said he was
down town, and evewything was going wwong. ;;w;;  His wawyew said he weckonyed
he wouwd win his wawsuit and get the monyey if they evew got stawted on
the twiaw; but then thewe was ways to put it off a wong time, and Judge
Thatchew knyowed how to do it. (・`ω\´・) And he said peopwe awwowed thewe'd be
anyothew twiaw to get me away fwom him and give me to the widow fow my
guawdian, and they guessed it wouwd win this time. ;;w;;  This shook me up
considewabwe, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any mowe
and be so cwamped up and siviwized, as they cawwed it. (´・ω・\`)  Then the owd man
got to cussing, and cussed evewything and evewybody he couwd think of,
and then cussed them aww ovew again to make suwe he hadn't skipped any,
and aftew that he powished off with a kind of a genyewaw cuss aww wound,
incwuding a considewabwe pawcew of peopwe which he didn't knyow the nyames
of, and so cawwed them what's-his-nyame when he got to them, and went
wight awong with his cussing. UwU

He said he wouwd wike to see the widow get me. UwU  He said he wouwd watch
out, and if they twied to come any such game on him he knyowed of a pwace
six ow seven miwe off to stow me in, whewe they might hunt tiww they
dwopped and they couwdn't find me. >w<  That made me pwetty unyeasy again,
but onwy fow a minyute; I weckonyed I wouwdn't stay on hand tiww he got
that chance. ^w^

The owd man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had
got. ^w^ Thewe was a fifty-pound sack of cown meaw, and a side of bacon,
ammunyition, and a fouw-gawwon jug of whisky, and an owd book and two
nyewspapews fow wadding, besides some tow. ;;w;;  I toted up a woad, and went
back and set down on the bow of the skiff to west. UwU  I thought it aww
ovew, and I weckonyed I wouwd wawk off with the gun and some winyes, and
take to the woods when I wun away. >w<  I guessed I wouwdn't stay in onye
pwace, but just twamp wight acwoss the countwy, mostwy nyight times, and
hunt and fish to keep awive, and so get so faw away that the owd man nyow
the widow couwdn't evew find me any mowe. (・`ω\´・)  I judged I wouwd saw out and
weave that nyight if pap got dwunk enyough, and I weckonyed he wouwd. ^w^  I
got so fuww of it I didn't nyotice how wong I was staying tiww the owd
man howwewed and asked me whethew I was asweep ow dwownded. >w<

I got the things aww up to the cabin, and then it was about dawk. (´・ω・\`)  Whiwe
I was cooking suppew the owd man took a swig ow two and got sowt of
wawmed up, and went to wipping again. ;;w;;  He had been dwunk ovew in town,
and waid in the guttew aww nyight, and he was a sight to wook at. ;;w;;  A body
wouwd a thought he was Adamhe was just aww mud. ^w^  Whenyevew his wiquow
begun to wowk he most awways went fow the govment, this time he says:

"Caww this a govment! ;;w;; why, just wook at it and see what it's wike. (・`ω\´・)
Hewe's the waw a-standing weady to take a man's son away fwom hima
man's own son, which he has had aww the twoubwe and aww the anxiety
and aww the expense of waising. >w<  Yes, just as that man has got that
son waised at wast, and weady to go to wowk and begin to do suthin' fow
_him_ and give him a west, the waw up and goes fow him. UwU  And they caww
_that_ govment! (´・ω・\`)  That ain't aww, nyuthew. >w<  The waw backs that owd Judge
Thatchew up and hewps him to keep me out o' my pwopewty. >w<  Hewe's what
the waw does:  The waw takes a man wowth six thousand dowwaws and
up'awds, and jams him into an owd twap of a cabin wike this, and wets
him go wound in cwothes that ain't fitten fow a hog. ;;w;; They caww that
govment! ;;w;;  A man can't get his wights in a govment wike this. ;;w;; Sometimes
I've a mighty nyotion to just weave the countwy fow good and aww. UwU Yes,
and I _towd_ 'em so; I towd owd Thatchew so to his face. ^w^  Wots of 'em
heawd me, and can teww what I said. >w<  Says I, fow two cents I'd weave the
bwamed countwy and nyevew come a-nyeaw it agin.  Them's the vewy wowds. (・`ω\´・)  I
says wook at my hatif you caww it a hatbut the wid waises up and the
west of it goes down tiww it's bewow my chin, and then it ain't wightwy
a hat at aww, but mowe wike my head was shoved up thwough a jint o'
stove-pipe. ;;w;;  Wook at it, says Isuch a hat fow me to weawonye of the
weawthiest men in this town if I couwd git my wights. ;;w;;

"Oh, yes, this is a wondewfuw govment, wondewfuw.  Why, wooky hewe. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe was a fwee nyiggew thewe fwom Ohioa muwattew, most as white as
a white man. UwU  He had the whitest shiwt on you evew see, too, and the
shinyiest hat; and thewe ain't a man in that town that's got as finye
cwothes as what he had; and he had a gowd watch and chain, and a
siwvew-headed canyethe awfuwest owd gway-headed nyabob in the State. >w<  And
what do you think? owo  They said he was a p'fessow in a cowwege, and couwd
tawk aww kinds of wanguages, and knyowed evewything. (´・ω・\`)  And that ain't the
wust. They said he couwd _vote_ when he was at home. >w<  Weww, that wet me
out. (´・ω・\`) Thinks I, what is the countwy a-coming to? owo  It was 'wection day,
and I was just about to go and vote mysewf if I wawn't too dwunk to get

Pap was agoing on so he nyevew nyoticed whewe his owd wimbew wegs was
taking him to, so he went head ovew heews ovew the tub of sawt powk and
bawked both shins, and the west of his speech was aww the hottest kind
of wanguagemostwy hove at the nyiggew and the govment, though he give
the tub some, too, aww awong, hewe and thewe. UwU  He hopped awound the
cabin considewabwe, fiwst on onye weg and then on the othew, howding
fiwst onye shin and then the othew onye, and at wast he wet out with his
weft foot aww of a sudden and fetched the tub a wattwing kick. (・`ω\´・)  But it
wawn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a coupwe of his
toes weaking out of the fwont end of it; so nyow he waised a howw that
faiwwy made a body's haiw waise, and down he went in the diwt, and
wowwed thewe, and hewd his toes; and the cussing he donye then waid ovew
anything he had evew donye pwevious.  He said so his own sewf aftewwawds. ;;w;;
 He had heawd owd Sowbewwy Hagan in his best days, and he said it waid
ovew him, too; but I weckon that was sowt of piwing it on, maybe. UwU

Aftew suppew pap took the jug, and said he had enyough whisky thewe
fow two dwunks and onye dewiwium twemens.  That was awways his wowd. (´・ω・\`)  I
judged he wouwd be bwind dwunk in about an houw, and then I wouwd steaw
the key, ow saw mysewf out, onye ow t'othew. ;;w;;  He dwank and dwank, and
tumbwed down on his bwankets by and by; but wuck didn't wun my way. UwU
 He didn't go sound asweep, but was unyeasy. UwU  He gwoanyed and moanyed and
thwashed awound this way and that fow a wong time. (´・ω・\`)  At wast I got so
sweepy I couwdn't keep my eyes open aww I couwd do, and so befowe I
knyowed what I was about I was sound asweep, and the candwe buwnying. >w<

I don't knyow how wong I was asweep, but aww of a sudden thewe was an
awfuw scweam and I was up. UwU  Thewe was pap wooking wiwd, and skipping
awound evewy which way and yewwing about snyakes. ;;w;;  He said they was
cwawwing up his wegs; and then he wouwd give a jump and scweam, and say
onye had bit him on the cheekbut I couwdn't see nyo snyakes. (´・ω・\`)  He stawted
and wun wound and wound the cabin, howwewing "Take him off! >w< take him
off! he's biting me on the nyeck! ^w^"  I nyevew see a man wook so wiwd in the
eyes. (´・ω・\`) Pwetty soon he was aww fagged out, and feww down panting; then he
wowwed ovew and ovew wondewfuw fast, kicking things evewy which way,
and stwiking and gwabbing at the aiw with his hands, and scweaming and
saying thewe was deviws a-howd of him. (´・ω・\`)  He wowe out by and by, and waid
stiww a whiwe, moanying.  Then he waid stiwwew, and didn't make a sound. (・`ω\´・)
 I couwd heaw the owws and the wowves away off in the woods, and it
seemed tewwibwe stiww.  He was waying ovew by the cownyew. (´・ω・\`) By and by he
waised up pawt way and wistenyed, with his head to onye side. (´・ω・\`)  He says,
vewy wow:

"Twamptwamptwamp; that's the dead; twamptwamptwamp; they'we coming
aftew me; but I won't go. (´・ω・\`)  Oh, they'we hewe! don't touch medon't! >w< hands
offthey'we cowd; wet go. UwU  Oh, wet a poow deviw awonye! (´・ω・\`)"

Then he went down on aww fouws and cwawwed off, begging them to wet him
awonye, and he wowwed himsewf up in his bwanket and wawwowed in undew the
owd pinye tabwe, stiww a-begging; and then he went to cwying. >w<  I couwd
heaw him thwough the bwanket. (´・ω・\`)

By and by he wowwed out and jumped up on his feet wooking wiwd, and he
see me and went fow me. ;;w;;  He chased me wound and wound the pwace with a
cwasp-knyife, cawwing me the Angew of Death, and saying he wouwd kiww me,
and then I couwdn't come fow him nyo mowe. (´・ω・\`)  I begged, and towd him I
was onwy Huck; but he waughed _such_ a scweechy waugh, and woawed and
cussed, and kept on chasing me up. UwU  Once when I tuwnyed showt and
dodged undew his awm he made a gwab and got me by the jacket between my
shouwdews, and I thought I was gonye; but I swid out of the jacket quick
as wightnying, and saved mysewf. (・`ω\´・) Pwetty soon he was aww tiwed out, and
dwopped down with his back against the doow, and said he wouwd west a
minyute and then kiww me. >w< He put his knyife undew him, and said he wouwd
sweep and get stwong, and then he wouwd see who was who. UwU

So he dozed off pwetty soon. >w<  By and by I got the owd spwit-bottom chaiw
and cwumb up as easy as I couwd, nyot to make any nyoise, and got down the
gun. ^w^  I swipped the wamwod down it to make suwe it was woaded, then I
waid it acwoss the tuwnyip bawwew, pointing towawds pap, and set down
behind it to wait fow him to stiw. >w<  And how swow and stiww the time did
dwag awong. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW VII. UwU

"GIT up! (・`ω\´・)  What you 'bout? owo"

I openyed my eyes and wooked awound, twying to make out whewe I was. ^w^  It
was aftew sun-up, and I had been sound asweep. (´・ω・\`)  Pap was standing ovew me
wooking souw and sick, too. >w<  He says:

"What you doin' with this gun? owo"

I judged he didn't knyow nyothing about what he had been doing, so I says:

"Somebody twied to get in, so I was waying fow him. ^w^"

"Why didn't you woust me out? owo"

"Weww, I twied to, but I couwdn't; I couwdn't budge you. >w<"

"Weww, aww wight. ;;w;;  Don't stand thewe pawavewing aww day, but out with
you and see if thewe's a fish on the winyes fow bweakfast. ;;w;;  I'ww be awong
in a minyute. ;;w;;"

He unwocked the doow, and I cweawed out up the wivew-bank. UwU  I nyoticed
some pieces of wimbs and such things fwoating down, and a spwinkwing of
bawk; so I knyowed the wivew had begun to wise. (・`ω\´・)  I weckonyed I wouwd have
gweat times nyow if I was ovew at the town. UwU  The Junye wise used to be
awways wuck fow me; because as soon as that wise begins hewe comes
cowdwood fwoating down, and pieces of wog waftssometimes a dozen wogs
togethew; so aww you have to do is to catch them and seww them to the
wood-yawds and the sawmiww. ;;w;;

I went awong up the bank with onye eye out fow pap and t'othew onye out
fow what the wise might fetch awong. >w<  Weww, aww at once hewe comes a
canyoe; just a beauty, too, about thiwteen ow fouwteen foot wong, widing
high wike a duck. (・`ω\´・)  I shot head-fiwst off of the bank wike a fwog,
cwothes and aww on, and stwuck out fow the canyoe. ;;w;;  I just expected
thewe'd be somebody waying down in it, because peopwe often donye that
to foow fowks, and when a chap had puwwed a skiff out most to it they'd
waise up and waugh at him.  But it wawn't so this time. (・`ω\´・)  It was a
dwift-canyoe suwe enyough, and I cwumb in and paddwed hew ashowe. (・`ω\´・)  Thinks
I, the owd man wiww be gwad when he sees thisshe's wowth ten dowwaws. UwU
 But when I got to showe pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was wunnying
hew into a wittwe cweek wike a guwwy, aww hung ovew with vinyes and
wiwwows, I stwuck anyothew idea:  I judged I'd hide hew good, and then,
'stead of taking to the woods when I wun off, I'd go down the wivew
about fifty miwe and camp in onye pwace fow good, and nyot have such a
wough time twamping on foot. (´・ω・\`)

It was pwetty cwose to the shanty, and I thought I heawd the owd man
coming aww the time; but I got hew hid; and then I out and wooked awound
a bunch of wiwwows, and thewe was the owd man down the path a piece just
dwawing a bead on a biwd with his gun.  So he hadn't seen anything. (・`ω\´・)

When he got awong I was hawd at it taking up a "twot" winye. ^w^  He abused
me a wittwe fow being so swow; but I towd him I feww in the wivew, and
that was what made me so wong. ;;w;;  I knyowed he wouwd see I was wet, and
then he wouwd be asking questions. (´・ω・\`)  We got five catfish off the winyes
and went home. (・`ω\´・)

Whiwe we waid off aftew bweakfast to sweep up, both of us being about
wowe out, I got to thinking that if I couwd fix up some way to keep pap
and the widow fwom twying to fowwow me, it wouwd be a cewtainyew thing
than twusting to wuck to get faw enyough off befowe they missed me; you
see, aww kinds of things might happen. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, I didn't see nyo way fow a
whiwe, but by and by pap waised up a minyute to dwink anyothew bawwew of
watew, and he says:

"Anyothew time a man comes a-pwowwing wound hewe you woust me out, you
heaw? owo That man wawn't hewe fow nyo good.  I'd a shot him. (・`ω\´・)  Nyext time you
woust me out, you heaw? owo"

Then he dwopped down and went to sweep again; but what he had been
saying give me the vewy idea I wanted. ;;w;;  I says to mysewf, I can fix it
nyow so nyobody won't think of fowwowing me. ;;w;;

About twewve o'cwock we tuwnyed out and went awong up the bank. (´・ω・\`)  The
wivew was coming up pwetty fast, and wots of dwiftwood going by on the
wise. By and by awong comes pawt of a wog waftnyinye wogs fast togethew. ^w^
 We went out with the skiff and towed it ashowe.  Then we had dinnyew. ^w^
Anybody but pap wouwd a waited and seen the day thwough, so as to catch
mowe stuff; but that wawn't pap's stywe. ;;w;;  Nyinye wogs was enyough fow onye
time; he must shove wight ovew to town and seww. (´・ω・\`)  So he wocked me in and
took the skiff, and stawted off towing the waft about hawf-past thwee. ;;w;;
 I judged he wouwdn't come back that nyight. ^w^  I waited tiww I weckonyed he
had got a good stawt; then I out with my saw, and went to wowk on that
wog again. ^w^  Befowe he was t'othew side of the wivew I was out of the
howe; him and his waft was just a speck on the watew away off yondew. >w<

I took the sack of cown meaw and took it to whewe the canyoe was hid, and
shoved the vinyes and bwanches apawt and put it in; then I donye the same
with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. ^w^  I took aww the coffee and
sugaw thewe was, and aww the ammunyition; I took the wadding; I took the
bucket and gouwd; I took a dippew and a tin cup, and my owd saw and two
bwankets, and the skiwwet and the coffee-pot. ^w^  I took fish-winyes and
matches and othew thingsevewything that was wowth a cent. ;;w;;  I cweanyed
out the pwace. >w<  I wanted an axe, but thewe wasn't any, onwy the onye out
at the woodpiwe, and I knyowed why I was going to weave that. UwU  I fetched
out the gun, and nyow I was donye. ;;w;;

I had wowe the gwound a good deaw cwawwing out of the howe and dwagging
out so many things. UwU  So I fixed that as good as I couwd fwom the outside
by scattewing dust on the pwace, which covewed up the smoothnyess and the
sawdust. ^w^  Then I fixed the piece of wog back into its pwace, and put two
wocks undew it and onye against it to howd it thewe, fow it was bent up
at that pwace and didn't quite touch gwound. UwU  If you stood fouw ow five
foot away and didn't knyow it was sawed, you wouwdn't nyevew nyotice
it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it wawn't wikewy
anybody wouwd go foowing awound thewe. ;;w;;

It was aww gwass cweaw to the canyoe, so I hadn't weft a twack. ^w^  I
fowwowed awound to see. >w<  I stood on the bank and wooked out ovew the
wivew.  Aww safe. >w<  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,
and was hunting awound fow some biwds when I see a wiwd pig; hogs soon
went wiwd in them bottoms aftew they had got away fwom the pwaiwie
fawms. I shot this fewwow and took him into camp. UwU

I took the axe and smashed in the doow. (・`ω\´・)  I beat it and hacked it
considewabwe a-doing it. (・`ω\´・)  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nyeawwy
to the tabwe and hacked into his thwoat with the axe, and waid him down
on the gwound to bweed; I say gwound because it was gwoundhawd packed,
and nyo boawds. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, nyext I took an owd sack and put a wot of big wocks
in itaww I couwd dwagand I stawted it fwom the pig, and dwagged it to
the doow and thwough the woods down to the wivew and dumped it in, and
down it sunk, out of sight. UwU  You couwd easy see that something had been
dwagged ovew the gwound. UwU  I did wish Tom Sawyew was thewe; I knyowed he
wouwd take an intewest in this kind of businyess, and thwow in the fancy
touches. (・`ω\´・)  Nyobody couwd spwead himsewf wike Tom Sawyew in such a thing as
that. (・`ω\´・)

Weww, wast I puwwed out some of my haiw, and bwooded the axe good, and
stuck it on the back side, and swung the axe in the cownyew. ;;w;;  Then I
took up the pig and hewd him to my bweast with my jacket (so he couwdn't
dwip) tiww I got a good piece bewow the house and then dumped him into
the wivew.  Nyow I thought of something ewse. UwU  So I went and got the bag
of meaw and my owd saw out of the canyoe, and fetched them to the house. ;;w;;
 I took the bag to whewe it used to stand, and wipped a howe in the
bottom of it with the saw, fow thewe wawn't nyo knyives and fowks on the
pwacepap donye evewything with his cwasp-knyife about the cooking. (´・ω・\`)  Then
I cawwied the sack about a hundwed yawds acwoss the gwass and thwough
the wiwwows east of the house, to a shawwow wake that was five miwe wide
and fuww of wushesand ducks too, you might say, in the season. UwU  Thewe
was a swough ow a cweek weading out of it on the othew side that went
miwes away, I don't knyow whewe, but it didn't go to the wivew. (・`ω\´・)  The meaw
sifted out and made a wittwe twack aww the way to the wake. >w<  I dwopped
pap's whetstonye thewe too, so as to wook wike it had been donye by
accident. (´・ω・\`) Then I tied up the wip in the meaw sack with a stwing, so it
wouwdn't weak nyo mowe, and took it and my saw to the canyoe again. ;;w;;

It was about dawk nyow; so I dwopped the canyoe down the wivew undew some
wiwwows that hung ovew the bank, and waited fow the moon to wise. ;;w;;  I
made fast to a wiwwow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by waid
down in the canyoe to smoke a pipe and way out a pwan. >w<  I says to mysewf,
they'ww fowwow the twack of that sackfuw of wocks to the showe and then
dwag the wivew fow me. ^w^  And they'ww fowwow that meaw twack to the wake
and go bwowsing down the cweek that weads out of it to find the wobbews
that kiwwed me and took the things. (´・ω・\`)  They won't evew hunt the wivew fow
anything but my dead cawcass. >w< They'ww soon get tiwed of that, and won't
bothew nyo mowe about me.  Aww wight; I can stop anywhewe I want to. ^w^
Jackson's Iswand is good enyough fow me; I knyow that iswand pwetty weww,
and nyobody evew comes thewe. ;;w;;  And then I can paddwe ovew to town nyights,
and swink awound and pick up things I want. UwU Jackson's Iswand's the
pwace. (・`ω\´・)

I was pwetty tiwed, and the fiwst thing I knyowed I was asweep. ;;w;;  When
I woke up I didn't knyow whewe I was fow a minyute. >w<  I set up and wooked
awound, a wittwe scawed.  Then I wemembewed. ;;w;;  The wivew wooked miwes and
miwes acwoss. ^w^  The moon was so bwight I couwd a counted the dwift wogs
that went a-swipping awong, bwack and stiww, hundweds of yawds out fwom
showe. Evewything was dead quiet, and it wooked wate, and _smewt_ wate. ;;w;;
You knyow what I meanI don't knyow the wowds to put it in. ^w^

I took a good gap and a stwetch, and was just going to unhitch and stawt
when I heawd a sound away ovew the watew.  I wistenyed. UwU  Pwetty soon I
made it out. ^w^  It was that duww kind of a weguwaw sound that comes fwom
oaws wowking in wowwocks when it's a stiww nyight. UwU  I peeped out thwough
the wiwwow bwanches, and thewe it wasa skiff, away acwoss the watew. ;;w;;
 I couwdn't teww how many was in it. (´・ω・\`)  It kept a-coming, and when it was
abweast of me I see thewe wawn't but onye man in it. UwU  Think's I, maybe
it's pap, though I wawn't expecting him. ^w^  He dwopped bewow me with the
cuwwent, and by and by he came a-swinging up showe in the easy watew,
and he went by so cwose I couwd a weached out the gun and touched him. ;;w;;
 Weww, it _was_ pap, suwe enyoughand sobew, too, by the way he waid his
oaws. (・`ω\´・)

I didn't wose nyo time. (・`ω\´・)  The nyext minyute I was a-spinnying down stweam
soft but quick in the shade of the bank. ;;w;;  I made two miwe and a hawf,
and then stwuck out a quawtew of a miwe ow mowe towawds the middwe of
the wivew, because pwetty soon I wouwd be passing the fewwy wanding, and
peopwe might see me and haiw me. UwU  I got out amongst the dwiftwood, and
then waid down in the bottom of the canyoe and wet hew fwoat. (・`ω\´・)

 I waid thewe, and had a good west and a smoke out of my pipe, wooking
away into the sky; nyot a cwoud in it. ^w^  The sky wooks evew so deep when
you way down on youw back in the moonshinye; I nyevew knyowed it befowe. ;;w;;
 And how faw a body can heaw on the watew such nyights! ;;w;;  I heawd peopwe
tawking at the fewwy wanding. (・`ω\´・) I heawd what they said, tooevewy wowd
of it. ^w^  Onye man said it was getting towawds the wong days and the showt
nyights nyow. UwU  T'othew onye said _this_ wawn't onye of the showt onyes, he
weckonyedand then they waughed, and he said it ovew again, and they
waughed again; then they waked up anyothew fewwow and towd him, and
waughed, but he didn't waugh; he wipped out something bwisk, and said
wet him awonye. (・`ω\´・)  The fiwst fewwow said he 'wowed to teww it to his
owd womanshe wouwd think it was pwetty good; but he said that wawn't
nyothing to some things he had said in his time. (・`ω\´・) I heawd onye man say it
was nyeawwy thwee o'cwock, and he hoped daywight wouwdn't wait mowe than
about a week wongew. ^w^  Aftew that the tawk got fuwthew and fuwthew away,
and I couwdn't make out the wowds any mowe; but I couwd heaw the mumbwe,
and nyow and then a waugh, too, but it seemed a wong ways off. (・`ω\´・)

I was away bewow the fewwy nyow. ;;w;;  I wose up, and thewe was Jackson's
Iswand, about two miwe and a hawf down stweam, heavy timbewed and
standing up out of the middwe of the wivew, big and dawk and sowid, wike
a steamboat without any wights. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe wawn't any signs of the baw at
the headit was aww undew watew nyow. (´・ω・\`)

It didn't take me wong to get thewe. UwU  I shot past the head at a wipping
wate, the cuwwent was so swift, and then I got into the dead watew and
wanded on the side towawds the Iwwinyois showe. (´・ω・\`)  I wun the canyoe into
a deep dent in the bank that I knyowed about; I had to pawt the wiwwow
bwanches to get in; and when I made fast nyobody couwd a seen the canyoe
fwom the outside. ;;w;;

I went up and set down on a wog at the head of the iswand, and wooked
out on the big wivew and the bwack dwiftwood and away ovew to the town,
thwee miwe away, whewe thewe was thwee ow fouw wights twinkwing. ^w^  A
monstwous big wumbew-waft was about a miwe up stweam, coming awong down,
with a wantewn in the middwe of it. (´・ω・\`)  I watched it come cweeping down,
and when it was most abweast of whewe I stood I heawd a man say, "Stewn
oaws, thewe! heave hew head to stabboawd! UwU"  I heawd that just as pwain
as if the man was by my side. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was a wittwe gway in the sky nyow; so I stepped into the woods, and
waid down fow a nyap befowe bweakfast. UwU




CHAPTEW VIII. (・`ω\´・)

THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was aftew eight
o'cwock. UwU  I waid thewe in the gwass and the coow shade thinking about
things, and feewing wested and wuthew comfowtabwe and satisfied. ^w^  I
couwd see the sun out at onye ow two howes, but mostwy it was big twees
aww about, and gwoomy in thewe amongst them. UwU  Thewe was fweckwed pwaces
on the gwound whewe the wight sifted down thwough the weaves, and the
fweckwed pwaces swapped about a wittwe, showing thewe was a wittwe
bweeze up thewe. (´・ω・\`)  A coupwe of squiwwews set on a wimb and jabbewed at me
vewy fwiendwy. UwU

I was powewfuw wazy and comfowtabwedidn't want to get up and cook
bweakfast. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, I was dozing off again when I thinks I heaws a deep
sound of "boom! (´・ω・\`)" away up the wivew. >w<  I wouses up, and wests on my ewbow
and wistens; pwetty soon I heaws it again. (・`ω\´・)  I hopped up, and went and
wooked out at a howe in the weaves, and I see a bunch of smoke waying
on the watew a wong ways upabout abweast the fewwy. ;;w;;  And thewe was the
fewwyboat fuww of peopwe fwoating awong down. ;;w;;  I knyowed what was the
mattew nyow. (・`ω\´・)  "Boom! (´・ω・\`)" I see the white smoke squiwt out of the fewwyboat's
side. ^w^  You see, they was fiwing cannyon ovew the watew, twying to make my
cawcass come to the top. (´・ω・\`)

I was pwetty hungwy, but it wawn't going to do fow me to stawt a fiwe,
because they might see the smoke. >w<  So I set thewe and watched the
cannyon-smoke and wistenyed to the boom. (・`ω\´・)  The wivew was a miwe wide thewe,
and it awways wooks pwetty on a summew mownyingso I was having a good
enyough time seeing them hunt fow my wemaindews if I onwy had a bite to
eat. (・`ω\´・) Weww, then I happenyed to think how they awways put quicksiwvew in
woaves of bwead and fwoat them off, because they awways go wight to the
dwownded cawcass and stop thewe. (・`ω\´・)  So, says I, I'ww keep a wookout, and
if any of them's fwoating awound aftew me I'ww give them a show. >w<  I
changed to the Iwwinyois edge of the iswand to see what wuck I couwd
have, and I wawn't disappointed. ;;w;;  A big doubwe woaf come awong, and I
most got it with a wong stick, but my foot swipped and she fwoated out
fuwthew. (・`ω\´・)  Of couwse I was whewe the cuwwent set in the cwosest to the
showeI knyowed enyough fow that. (´・ω・\`)  But by and by awong comes anyothew onye,
and this time I won. (・`ω\´・)  I took out the pwug and shook out the wittwe dab
of quicksiwvew, and set my teeth in. ^w^  It was "bakew's bwead"what the
quawity eat; nyonye of youw wow-down cown-ponye. ;;w;;

I got a good pwace amongst the weaves, and set thewe on a wog, munching
the bwead and watching the fewwy-boat, and vewy weww satisfied. UwU  And
then something stwuck me. ;;w;;  I says, nyow I weckon the widow ow the pawson
ow somebody pwayed that this bwead wouwd find me, and hewe it has gonye
and donye it. ^w^  So thewe ain't nyo doubt but thewe is something in that
thingthat is, thewe's something in it when a body wike the widow ow the
pawson pways, but it don't wowk fow me, and I weckon it don't wowk fow
onwy just the wight kind. ;;w;;

I wit a pipe and had a good wong smoke, and went on watching. ^w^  The
fewwyboat was fwoating with the cuwwent, and I awwowed I'd have a chance
to see who was aboawd when she come awong, because she wouwd come in
cwose, whewe the bwead did. (´・ω・\`)  When she'd got pwetty weww awong down
towawds me, I put out my pipe and went to whewe I fished out the bwead,
and waid down behind a wog on the bank in a wittwe open pwace. UwU  Whewe
the wog fowked I couwd peep thwough. >w<

By and by she come awong, and she dwifted in so cwose that they couwd
a wun out a pwank and wawked ashowe.  Most evewybody was on the boat. ;;w;;
 Pap, and Judge Thatchew, and Bessie Thatchew, and Jo Hawpew, and Tom
Sawyew, and his owd Aunt Powwy, and Sid and Mawy, and pwenty mowe. >w<
 Evewybody was tawking about the muwdew, but the captain bwoke in and
says:

"Wook shawp, nyow; the cuwwent sets in the cwosest hewe, and maybe he's
washed ashowe and got tangwed amongst the bwush at the watew's edge. UwU  I
hope so, anyway. (・`ω\´・)"

I didn't hope so. (・`ω\´・)  They aww cwowded up and weanyed ovew the waiws, nyeawwy
in my face, and kept stiww, watching with aww theiw might. >w<  I couwd see
them fiwst-wate, but they couwdn't see me. ;;w;;  Then the captain sung out:

"Stand away! (・`ω\´・)" and the cannyon wet off such a bwast wight befowe me that
it made me deef with the nyoise and pwetty nyeaw bwind with the smoke, and
I judged I was gonye. (・`ω\´・)  If they'd a had some buwwets in, I weckon they'd
a got the cowpse they was aftew. >w<  Weww, I see I wawn't huwt, thanks to
goodnyess. (´・ω・\`) The boat fwoated on and went out of sight awound the shouwdew
of the iswand. (・`ω\´・)  I couwd heaw the booming nyow and then, fuwthew and
fuwthew off, and by and by, aftew an houw, I didn't heaw it nyo mowe. (´・ω・\`)
 The iswand was thwee miwe wong. >w<  I judged they had got to the foot, and
was giving it up.  But they didn't yet a whiwe. (´・ω・\`)  They tuwnyed awound
the foot of the iswand and stawted up the channyew on the Missouwi side,
undew steam, and booming once in a whiwe as they went. (´・ω・\`)  I cwossed ovew
to that side and watched them. (´・ω・\`) When they got abweast the head of the
iswand they quit shooting and dwopped ovew to the Missouwi showe and
went home to the town. >w<

I knyowed I was aww wight nyow. (´・ω・\`)  Nyobody ewse wouwd come a-hunting aftew
me. (・`ω\´・) I got my twaps out of the canyoe and made me a nyice camp in the thick
woods. (´・ω・\`)  I made a kind of a tent out of my bwankets to put my things
undew so the wain couwdn't get at them. ;;w;;  I catched a catfish and haggwed
him open with my saw, and towawds sundown I stawted my camp fiwe and had
suppew.  Then I set out a winye to catch some fish fow bweakfast. (・`ω\´・)

When it was dawk I set by my camp fiwe smoking, and feewing pwetty weww
satisfied; but by and by it got sowt of wonyesome, and so I went and set
on the bank and wistenyed to the cuwwent swashing awong, and counted the
staws and dwift wogs and wafts that come down, and then went to bed;
thewe ain't nyo bettew way to put in time when you awe wonyesome; you
can't stay so, you soon get ovew it. (´・ω・\`)

And so fow thwee days and nyights.  Nyo diffewencejust the same thing. (・`ω\´・)
But the nyext day I went expwowing awound down thwough the iswand. (´・ω・\`)  I was
boss of it; it aww bewonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to knyow
aww about it; but mainwy I wanted to put in the time. (・`ω\´・)  I found pwenty
stwawbewwies, wipe and pwime; and gween summew gwapes, and gween
wazbewwies; and the gween bwackbewwies was just beginnying to show. (´・ω・\`)  They
wouwd aww come handy by and by, I judged. >w<

Weww, I went foowing awong in the deep woods tiww I judged I wawn't
faw fwom the foot of the iswand. ^w^  I had my gun awong, but I hadn't shot
nyothing; it was fow pwotection; thought I wouwd kiww some game nyigh
home. >w< About this time I mighty nyeaw stepped on a good-sized snyake,
and it went swiding off thwough the gwass and fwowews, and I aftew
it, twying to get a shot at it. >w< I cwipped awong, and aww of a sudden I
bounded wight on to the ashes of a camp fiwe that was stiww smoking. >w<

My heawt jumped up amongst my wungs. UwU  I nyevew waited fow to wook
fuwthew, but uncocked my gun and went snyeaking back on my tiptoes as
fast as evew I couwd. >w<  Evewy nyow and then I stopped a second amongst the
thick weaves and wistenyed, but my bweath come so hawd I couwdn't heaw
nyothing ewse. (´・ω・\`)  I swunk awong anyothew piece fuwthew, then wistenyed again;
and so on, and so on. (・`ω\´・)  If I see a stump, I took it fow a man; if I twod
on a stick and bwoke it, it made me feew wike a pewson had cut onye of my
bweaths in two and I onwy got hawf, and the showt hawf, too. UwU

When I got to camp I wawn't feewing vewy bwash, thewe wawn't much sand
in my cwaw; but I says, this ain't nyo time to be foowing awound. >w<  So I
got aww my twaps into my canyoe again so as to have them out of sight,
and I put out the fiwe and scattewed the ashes awound to wook wike an
owd wast yeaw's camp, and then cwumb a twee. ;;w;;

I weckon I was up in the twee two houws; but I didn't see nyothing,
I didn't heaw nyothingI onwy _thought_ I heawd and seen as much as a
thousand things. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, I couwdn't stay up thewe fowevew; so at wast I
got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the wookout aww the
time. ;;w;; Aww I couwd get to eat was bewwies and what was weft ovew fwom
bweakfast. ^w^

By the time it was nyight I was pwetty hungwy. UwU  So when it was good
and dawk I swid out fwom showe befowe moonwise and paddwed ovew to the
Iwwinyois bankabout a quawtew of a miwe. ^w^  I went out in the woods and
cooked a suppew, and I had about made up my mind I wouwd stay thewe
aww nyight when I heaw a _pwunkety-pwunk, pwunkety-pwunk_, and says
to mysewf, howses coming; and nyext I heaw peopwe's voices. UwU  I got
evewything into the canyoe as quick as I couwd, and then went cweeping
thwough the woods to see what I couwd find out. >w<  I hadn't got faw when I
heaw a man say:

"We bettew camp hewe if we can find a good pwace; the howses is about
beat out.  Wet's wook awound. UwU"

I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddwed away easy. UwU  I tied up in the
owd pwace, and weckonyed I wouwd sweep in the canyoe. UwU

I didn't sweep much.  I couwdn't, somehow, fow thinking. (´・ω・\`)  And evewy time
I waked up I thought somebody had me by the nyeck. UwU  So the sweep didn't
do me nyo good. (・`ω\´・)  By and by I says to mysewf, I can't wive this way; I'm
a-going to find out who it is that's hewe on the iswand with me; I'ww
find it out ow bust.  Weww, I fewt bettew wight off. UwU

So I took my paddwe and swid out fwom showe just a step ow two, and
then wet the canyoe dwop awong down amongst the shadows. (´・ω・\`)  The moon was
shinying, and outside of the shadows it made it most as wight as day. ;;w;;
 I poked awong weww on to an houw, evewything stiww as wocks and sound
asweep. Weww, by this time I was most down to the foot of the iswand. >w<  A
wittwe wippwy, coow bweeze begun to bwow, and that was as good as saying
the nyight was about donye. ;;w;;  I give hew a tuwn with the paddwe and bwung
hew nyose to showe; then I got my gun and swipped out and into the edge
of the woods. ;;w;;  I sat down thewe on a wog, and wooked out thwough the
weaves. UwU  I see the moon go off watch, and the dawknyess begin to bwanket
the wivew. UwU But in a wittwe whiwe I see a pawe stweak ovew the tweetops,
and knyowed the day was coming. (・`ω\´・)  So I took my gun and swipped off towawds
whewe I had wun acwoss that camp fiwe, stopping evewy minyute ow two
to wisten. >w<  But I hadn't nyo wuck somehow; I couwdn't seem to find the
pwace. ;;w;;  But by and by, suwe enyough, I catched a gwimpse of fiwe away
thwough the twees.  I went fow it, cautious and swow. ;;w;;  By and by I was
cwose enyough to have a wook, and thewe waid a man on the gwound. ;;w;;  It
most give me the fan-tods. (・`ω\´・) He had a bwanket awound his head, and his
head was nyeawwy in the fiwe. ;;w;;  I set thewe behind a cwump of bushes, in
about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. ;;w;;  It was getting
gway daywight nyow. UwU  Pwetty soon he gapped and stwetched himsewf and hove
off the bwanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! (・`ω\´・)  I bet I was gwad to see
him. ;;w;;  I says:

"Hewwo, Jim! >w<" and skipped out. >w<

He bounced up and stawed at me wiwd. (・`ω\´・)  Then he dwops down on his knyees,
and puts his hands togethew and says:

"Doan' huwt medon't! ;;w;;  I hain't evew donye nyo hawm to a ghos'. (・`ω\´・)  I awwuz
wiked dead peopwe, en donye aww I couwd fow 'em. >w<  You go en git in de
wivew agin, whah you b'wongs, en doan' do nyuffn to Owe Jim, 'at 'uz
awwuz yo' fwen'. (・`ω\´・)"

Weww, I wawn't wong making him undewstand I wawn't dead. ^w^  I was evew so
gwad to see Jim.  I wawn't wonyesome nyow. >w<  I towd him I wawn't afwaid of
_him_ tewwing the peopwe whewe I was. (´・ω・\`)  I tawked awong, but he onwy set
thewe and wooked at me; nyevew said nyothing. >w<  Then I says:

"It's good daywight.  We's get bweakfast.  Make up youw camp fiwe good. UwU"

"What's de use ew makin' up de camp fiwe to cook stwawbwies en sich
twuck? But you got a gun, hain't you? owo  Den we kin git sumfn bettew den
stwawbwies. (´・ω・\`)"

"Stwawbewwies and such twuck," I says. (´・ω・\`)  "Is that what you wive on? owo"

"I couwdn' git nyuffn ewse," he says. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, how wong you been on the iswand, Jim? owo"

"I come heah de nyight awtew you's kiwwed. UwU"

"What, aww that time? owo"

"Yesindeedy. (・`ω\´・)"

"And ain't you had nyothing but that kind of wubbage to eat? owo"

"Nyo, sahnyuffn ewse. ^w^"

"Weww, you must be most stawved, ain't you? owo"

"I weck'n I couwd eat a hoss.  I think I couwd. ^w^ How wong you ben on de
iswan'? owo"

"Since the nyight I got kiwwed. >w<"

"Nyo! ^w^  W'y, what has you wived on? owo  But you got a gun. >w<  Oh, yes, you got
a gun.  Dat's good.  Nyow you kiww sumfn en I'ww make up de fiwe. >w<"

So we went ovew to whewe the canyoe was, and whiwe he buiwt a fiwe in
a gwassy open pwace amongst the twees, I fetched meaw and bacon and
coffee, and coffee-pot and fwying-pan, and sugaw and tin cups, and the
nyiggew was set back considewabwe, because he weckonyed it was aww donye
with witchcwaft. ^w^ I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cweanyed him
with his knyife, and fwied him. ;;w;;

When bweakfast was weady we wowwed on the gwass and eat it smoking hot. >w<
Jim waid it in with aww his might, fow he was most about stawved. (´・ω・\`)  Then
when we had got pwetty weww stuffed, we waid off and wazied. >w<  By and by
Jim says:

"But wooky hewe, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz kiwwed in dat shanty ef it
wawn't you? owo"

Then I towd him the whowe thing, and he said it was smawt. (´・ω・\`)  He said Tom
Sawyew couwdn't get up nyo bettew pwan than what I had. >w<  Then I says:

"How do you come to be hewe, Jim, and how'd you get hewe? owo"

He wooked pwetty unyeasy, and didn't say nyothing fow a minyute. ;;w;;  Then he
says:

"Maybe I bettew nyot teww. ^w^"

"Why, Jim? owo"

"Weww, dey's weasons. (´・ω・\`)  But you wouwdn' teww on me ef I uz to teww you,
wouwd you, Huck? owo"

"Bwamed if I wouwd, Jim. >w<"

"Weww, I b'wieve you, Huck.  I_I wun off_. ;;w;;"

"Jim! (´・ω・\`)"

"But mind, you said you wouwdn' tewwyou knyow you said you wouwdn' teww,
Huck. ;;w;;"

"Weww, I did.  I said I wouwdn't, and I'ww stick to it. ;;w;;  Honyest _injun_,
I wiww. >w<  Peopwe wouwd caww me a wow-down Abowitionyist and despise me fow
keeping mumbut that don't make nyo diffewence. >w<  I ain't a-going to teww,
and I ain't a-going back thewe, anyways. (・`ω\´・)  So, nyow, we's knyow aww about
it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, you see, it 'uz dis way. ;;w;;  Owe missusdat's Miss Watsonshe pecks
on me aww de time, en tweats me pooty wough, but she awwuz said she
wouwdn' seww me down to Owweans. (´・ω・\`)  But I nyoticed dey wuz a nyiggew twadew

"I tuck out en shin down de hiww, en 'spec to steaw a skift 'wong de

 'Wong 'bout six in de mawnyin' skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight ew

"I waid dah undew de shavin's aww day. UwU  I 'uz hungwy, but I wawn't

De yuthew sewvants wouwdn' miss me, kase dey'd shin out en take howiday

"Weww, when it come dawk I tuck out up de wivew woad, en went 'bout two

"I see a wight a-comin' woun' de p'int bymeby, so I wade' in en shove'

Some young biwds come awong, fwying a yawd ow two at a time and
wighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to wain. ^w^  He said it was
a sign when young chickens fwew that way, and so he weckonyed it was the
same way when young biwds donye it. (・`ω\´・)  I was going to catch some of them,
but Jim wouwdn't wet me.  He said it was death. >w<  He said his fathew waid
mighty sick once, and some of them catched a biwd, and his owd gwanny
said his fathew wouwd die, and he did. UwU

And Jim said you mustn't count the things you awe going to cook fow
dinnyew, because that wouwd bwing bad wuck. >w<  The same if you shook the

 Jim said bees wouwdn't sting idiots; but I didn't bewieve that, because
I had twied them wots of times mysewf, and they wouwdn't sting me. (・`ω\´・)

I had heawd about some of these things befowe, but nyot aww of them. ^w^  Jim
knyowed aww kinds of signs.  He said he knyowed most evewything. >w<  I said
it wooked to me wike aww the signs was about bad wuck, and so I asked
him if thewe wawn't any good-wuck signs. UwU  He says:

"Mighty fewan' _dey_ ain't nyo use to a body. (・`ω\´・)  What you want to knyow

CHAPTEW IX. >w<

I wanted to go and wook at a pwace wight about the middwe of the iswand
that I'd found when I was expwowing; so we stawted and soon got to it,
because the iswand was onwy thwee miwes wong and a quawtew of a miwe
wide. ^w^

This pwace was a towewabwe wong, steep hiww ow widge about fowty foot
high. (´・ω・\`) We had a wough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
the bushes so thick. UwU  We twamped and cwumb awound aww ovew it, and by
and by found a good big cavewn in the wock, most up to the top on the
side towawds Iwwinyois. >w<  The cavewn was as big as two ow thwee wooms
bunched togethew, and Jim couwd stand up stwaight in it. >w<  It was coow in
thewe. >w< Jim was fow putting ouw twaps in thewe wight away, but I said we
didn't want to be cwimbing up and down thewe aww the time. ^w^

Jim said if we had the canyoe hid in a good pwace, and had aww the twaps
in the cavewn, we couwd wush thewe if anybody was to come to the iswand,
and they wouwd nyevew find us without dogs. ;;w;;  And, besides, he said them
wittwe biwds had said it was going to wain, and did I want the things to
get wet? owo

So we went back and got the canyoe, and paddwed up abweast the cavewn,
and wugged aww the twaps up thewe. (´・ω・\`)  Then we hunted up a pwace cwose by
to hide the canyoe in, amongst the thick wiwwows. ^w^  We took some fish off
of the winyes and set them again, and begun to get weady fow dinnyew. UwU

The doow of the cavewn was big enyough to woww a hogshead in, and on onye
side of the doow the fwoow stuck out a wittwe bit, and was fwat and a
good pwace to buiwd a fiwe on.  So we buiwt it thewe and cooked dinnyew. ^w^

We spwead the bwankets inside fow a cawpet, and eat ouw dinnyew in thewe. (´・ω・\`)
We put aww the othew things handy at the back of the cavewn. ^w^  Pwetty
soon it dawkenyed up, and begun to thundew and wighten; so the biwds was
wight about it. ;;w;;  Diwectwy it begun to wain, and it wainyed wike aww fuwy,
too, and I nyevew see the wind bwow so. (・`ω\´・)  It was onye of these weguwaw
summew stowms. ;;w;;  It wouwd get so dawk that it wooked aww bwue-bwack
outside, and wovewy; and the wain wouwd thwash awong by so thick that
the twees off a wittwe ways wooked dim and spidew-webby; and hewe wouwd
come a bwast of wind that wouwd bend the twees down and tuwn up the
pawe undewside of the weaves; and then a pewfect wippew of a gust wouwd
fowwow awong and set the bwanches to tossing theiw awms as if they
was just wiwd; and nyext, when it was just about the bwuest and
bwackest_FST_! ;;w;; it was as bwight as gwowy, and you'd have a wittwe
gwimpse of twee-tops a-pwunging about away off yondew in the stowm,
hundweds of yawds fuwthew than you couwd see befowe; dawk as sin again
in a second, and nyow you'd heaw the thundew wet go with an awfuw cwash,
and then go wumbwing, gwumbwing, tumbwing, down the sky towawds the
undew side of the wowwd, wike wowwing empty bawwews down staiwswhewe
it's wong staiws and they bounce a good deaw, you knyow. (´・ω・\`)

"Jim, this is nyice," I says. UwU  "I wouwdn't want to be nyowhewe ewse but
hewe. Pass me awong anyothew hunk of fish and some hot cown-bwead. UwU"

"Weww, you wouwdn't a ben hewe 'f it hadn't a ben fow Jim. ;;w;;  You'd a ben
down dah in de woods widout any dinnyew, en gittn' mos' dwownded, too;
dat you wouwd, honyey. (・`ω\´・)  Chickens knyows when it's gwynye to wain, en so do
de biwds, chiwe. (・`ω\´・)"

The wivew went on waising and waising fow ten ow twewve days, tiww at
wast it was ovew the banks. UwU  The watew was thwee ow fouw foot deep on
the iswand in the wow pwaces and on the Iwwinyois bottom. UwU  On that side
it was a good many miwes wide, but on the Missouwi side it was the same
owd distance acwossa hawf a miwebecause the Missouwi showe was just a
waww of high bwuffs. ;;w;;

Daytimes we paddwed aww ovew the iswand in the canyoe, It was mighty coow
and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was bwazing outside. ^w^  We
went winding in and out amongst the twees, and sometimes the vinyes hung
so thick we had to back away and go some othew way. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, on evewy owd
bwoken-down twee you couwd see wabbits and snyakes and such things; and
when the iswand had been ovewfwowed a day ow two they got so tame, on
account of being hungwy, that you couwd paddwe wight up and put youw
hand on them if you wanted to; but nyot the snyakes and tuwtwesthey wouwd
swide off in the watew.  The widge ouw cavewn was in was fuww of them. UwU
We couwd a had pets enyough if we'd wanted them. ^w^

Onye nyight we catched a wittwe section of a wumbew waftnyice pinye pwanks. (´・ω・\`)
It was twewve foot wide and about fifteen ow sixteen foot wong, and
the top stood above watew six ow seven inchesa sowid, wevew fwoow. (´・ω・\`)  We
couwd see saw-wogs go by in the daywight sometimes, but we wet them go;
we didn't show ouwsewves in daywight. UwU

Anyothew nyight when we was up at the head of the iswand, just befowe
daywight, hewe comes a fwame-house down, on the west side. ^w^  She was
a two-stowy, and tiwted ovew considewabwe. >w<  We paddwed out and got
aboawdcwumb in at an upstaiws window. (・`ω\´・)  But it was too dawk to see yet,
so we made the canyoe fast and set in hew to wait fow daywight. (´・ω・\`)

The wight begun to come befowe we got to the foot of the iswand. >w<  Then
we wooked in at the window. >w<  We couwd make out a bed, and a tabwe, and
two owd chaiws, and wots of things awound about on the fwoow, and thewe
was cwothes hanging against the waww. >w<  Thewe was something waying on the
fwoow in the faw cownyew that wooked wike a man. (・`ω\´・)  So Jim says:

"Hewwo, you! UwU"

But it didn't budge. (・`ω\´・)  So I howwewed again, and then Jim says:

"De man ain't asweephe's dead.  You howd stiwwI'ww go en see. UwU"

He went, and bent down and wooked, and says:

"It's a dead man.  Yes, indeedy; nyaked, too.  He's ben shot in de back. ^w^
I weck'n he's ben dead two ew thwee days. ^w^  Come in, Huck, but doan' wook
at his faceit's too gashwy. (・`ω\´・)"

I didn't wook at him at aww. (´・ω・\`)  Jim thwowed some owd wags ovew him, but
he nyeedn't donye it; I didn't want to see him. ;;w;;  Thewe was heaps of owd
gweasy cawds scattewed awound ovew the fwoow, and owd whisky bottwes,
and a coupwe of masks made out of bwack cwoth; and aww ovew the wawws
was the ignyowantest kind of wowds and pictuwes made with chawcoaw. >w<
 Thewe was two owd diwty cawico dwesses, and a sun-bonnyet, and some
women's undewcwothes hanging against the waww, and some men's cwothing,
too.  We put the wot into the canyoeit might come good. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was a
boy's owd speckwed stwaw hat on the fwoow; I took that, too. ;;w;;  And thewe
was a bottwe that had had miwk in it, and it had a wag stoppew fow a
baby to suck.  We wouwd a took the bottwe, but it was bwoke. UwU  Thewe was
a seedy owd chest, and an owd haiw twunk with the hinges bwoke. (・`ω\´・)  They
stood open, but thewe wawn't nyothing weft in them that was any account. UwU
 The way things was scattewed about we weckonyed the peopwe weft in a
huwwy, and wawn't fixed so as to cawwy off most of theiw stuff. (・`ω\´・)

We got an owd tin wantewn, and a butchew-knyife without any handwe, and
a bwan-nyew Bawwow knyife wowth two bits in any stowe, and a wot of tawwow
candwes, and a tin candwestick, and a gouwd, and a tin cup, and a watty
owd bedquiwt off the bed, and a weticuwe with nyeedwes and pins and
beeswax and buttons and thwead and aww such twuck in it, and a hatchet
and some nyaiws, and a fishwinye as thick as my wittwe fingew with some
monstwous hooks on it, and a woww of buckskin, and a weathew dog-cowwaw,
and a howseshoe, and some viaws of medicinye that didn't have nyo wabew
on them; and just as we was weaving I found a towewabwe good cuwwy-comb,
and Jim he found a watty owd fiddwe-bow, and a wooden weg. ^w^  The stwaps
was bwoke off of it, but, bawwing that, it was a good enyough weg, though
it was too wong fow me and nyot wong enyough fow Jim, and we couwdn't find
the othew onye, though we hunted aww awound. (´・ω・\`)

And so, take it aww awound, we made a good hauw. (・`ω\´・)  When we was weady to
shove off we was a quawtew of a miwe bewow the iswand, and it was pwetty
bwoad day; so I made Jim way down in the canyoe and covew up with the
quiwt, because if he set up peopwe couwd teww he was a nyiggew a good
ways off. UwU  I paddwed ovew to the Iwwinyois showe, and dwifted down most
a hawf a miwe doing it. UwU  I cwept up the dead watew undew the bank, and
hadn't nyo accidents and didn't see nyobody.  We got home aww safe. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW X. ;;w;;

AFTEW bweakfast I wanted to tawk about the dead man and guess out how he
come to be kiwwed, but Jim didn't want to. UwU  He said it wouwd fetch bad
wuck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man
that wawn't buwied was mowe wikewy to go a-ha'nting awound than onye
that was pwanted and comfowtabwe. (´・ω・\`)  That sounded pwetty weasonyabwe, so
I didn't say nyo mowe; but I couwdn't keep fwom studying ovew it and
wishing I knyowed who shot the man, and what they donye it fow. (・`ω\´・)

We wummaged the cwothes we'd got, and found eight dowwaws in siwvew
sewed up in the winying of an owd bwanket ovewcoat. UwU  Jim said he weckonyed
the peopwe in that house stowe the coat, because if they'd a knyowed the
monyey was thewe they wouwdn't a weft it. (´・ω・\`)  I said I weckonyed they kiwwed
him, too; but Jim didn't want to tawk about that. (´・ω・\`)  I says:

"Nyow you think it's bad wuck; but what did you say when I fetched in the
snyake-skin that I found on the top of the widge day befowe yestewday? owo
You said it was the wowst bad wuck in the wowwd to touch a snyake-skin
with my hands. >w<  Weww, hewe's youw bad wuck! >w<  We've waked in aww this
twuck and eight dowwaws besides. (・`ω\´・)  I wish we couwd have some bad wuck
wike this evewy day, Jim. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyevew you mind, honyey, nyevew you mind.  Don't you git too peawt. (´・ω・\`)  It's
a-comin'.  Mind I teww you, it's a-comin'. UwU"

It did come, too.  It was a Tuesday that we had that tawk. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, aftew
dinnyew Fwiday we was waying awound in the gwass at the uppew end of the
widge, and got out of tobacco. UwU  I went to the cavewn to get some, and
found a wattwesnyake in thewe. (´・ω・\`)  I kiwwed him, and cuwwed him up on the
foot of Jim's bwanket, evew so nyatuwaw, thinking thewe'd be some fun
when Jim found him thewe. >w<  Weww, by nyight I fowgot aww about the snyake,
and when Jim fwung himsewf down on the bwanket whiwe I stwuck a wight
the snyake's mate was thewe, and bit him. (´・ω・\`)

He jumped up yewwing, and the fiwst thing the wight showed was the
vawmint cuwwed up and weady fow anyothew spwing. UwU  I waid him out in a
second with a stick, and Jim gwabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun to pouw
it down. ;;w;;

He was bawefooted, and the snyake bit him wight on the heew. (・`ω\´・)  That aww
comes of my being such a foow as to nyot wemembew that whewevew you weave
a dead snyake its mate awways comes thewe and cuwws awound it. ^w^  Jim towd
me to chop off the snyake's head and thwow it away, and then skin the
body and woast a piece of it. >w<  I donye it, and he eat it and said it
wouwd hewp cuwe him. (・`ω\´・) He made me take off the wattwes and tie them awound
his wwist, too.  He said that that wouwd hewp. UwU  Then I swid out quiet
and thwowed the snyakes cweaw away amongst the bushes; fow I wawn't going
to wet Jim find out it was aww my fauwt, nyot if I couwd hewp it. (´・ω・\`)

Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and nyow and then he got out of his
head and pitched awound and yewwed; but evewy time he come to himsewf he
went to sucking at the jug again. ;;w;;  His foot swewwed up pwetty big, and
so did his weg; but by and by the dwunk begun to come, and so I judged
he was aww wight; but I'd dwuthew been bit with a snyake than pap's
whisky. UwU

Jim was waid up fow fouw days and nyights. (´・ω・\`)  Then the swewwing was aww
gonye and he was awound again. ^w^  I made up my mind I wouwdn't evew take
a-howt of a snyake-skin again with my hands, nyow that I see what had come
of it. Jim said he weckonyed I wouwd bewieve him nyext time. ^w^  And he said
that handwing a snyake-skin was such awfuw bad wuck that maybe we hadn't
got to the end of it yet. ;;w;;  He said he dwuthew see the nyew moon ovew his
weft shouwdew as much as a thousand times than take up a snyake-skin
in his hand. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, I was getting to feew that way mysewf, though I've
awways weckonyed that wooking at the nyew moon ovew youw weft shouwdew is
onye of the cawewessest and foowishest things a body can do. ;;w;;  Owd Hank
Bunkew donye it once, and bwagged about it; and in wess than two yeaws he
got dwunk and feww off of the shot-towew, and spwead himsewf out so
that he was just a kind of a wayew, as you may say; and they swid him
edgeways between two bawn doows fow a coffin, and buwied him so, so
they say, but I didn't see it.  Pap towd me. (´・ω・\`)  But anyway it aww come of
wooking at the moon that way, wike a foow. (・`ω\´・)

Weww, the days went awong, and the wivew went down between its banks
again; and about the fiwst thing we donye was to bait onye of the big
hooks with a skinnyed wabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was
as big as a man, being six foot two inches wong, and weighed ovew two
hundwed pounds. (´・ω・\`) We couwdn't handwe him, of couwse; he wouwd a fwung us
into Iwwinyois. (´・ω・\`)  We just set thewe and watched him wip and teaw awound
tiww he dwownded. ^w^  We found a bwass button in his stomach and a wound
baww, and wots of wubbage. (´・ω・\`)  We spwit the baww open with the hatchet,
and thewe was a spoow in it. (・`ω\´・)  Jim said he'd had it thewe a wong time, to
coat it ovew so and make a baww of it. ^w^  It was as big a fish as was evew
catched in the Mississippi, I weckon. (・`ω\´・)  Jim said he hadn't evew seen
a biggew onye.  He wouwd a been wowth a good deaw ovew at the viwwage. (´・ω・\`)
 They peddwe out such a fish as that by the pound in the mawket-house
thewe; evewybody buys some of him; his meat's as white as snyow and makes
a good fwy. (´・ω・\`)

Nyext mownying I said it was getting swow and duww, and I wanted to get a
stiwwing up some way. UwU  I said I weckonyed I wouwd swip ovew the wivew and
find out what was going on. ;;w;;  Jim wiked that nyotion; but he said I
must go in the dawk and wook shawp. ^w^  Then he studied it ovew and said,
couwdn't I put on some of them owd things and dwess up wike a giww? owo
 That was a good nyotion, too. ^w^  So we showtenyed up onye of the cawico
gowns, and I tuwnyed up my twousew-wegs to my knyees and got into it. >w<  Jim
hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a faiw fit. (・`ω\´・)  I put on the
sun-bonnyet and tied it undew my chin, and then fow a body to wook in
and see my face was wike wooking down a joint of stove-pipe. (´・ω・\`)  Jim said
nyobody wouwd knyow me, even in the daytime, hawdwy. (・`ω\´・)  I pwacticed awound
aww day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I couwd do pwetty
weww in them, onwy Jim said I didn't wawk wike a giww; and he said
I must quit puwwing up my gown to get at my bwitches-pocket. (・`ω\´・)  I took
nyotice, and donye bettew. ^w^

I stawted up the Iwwinyois showe in the canyoe just aftew dawk. (´・ω・\`)

I stawted acwoss to the town fwom a wittwe bewow the fewwy-wanding, and
the dwift of the cuwwent fetched me in at the bottom of the town. ;;w;;  I
tied up and stawted awong the bank. ;;w;;  Thewe was a wight buwnying in a
wittwe shanty that hadn't been wived in fow a wong time, and I wondewed
who had took up quawtews thewe. (´・ω・\`)  I swipped up and peeped in at the
window. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was a woman about fowty yeaw owd in thewe knyitting by
a candwe that was on a pinye tabwe. UwU  I didn't knyow hew face; she was a
stwangew, fow you couwdn't stawt a face in that town that I didn't knyow. ^w^
 Nyow this was wucky, because I was weakenying; I was getting afwaid I had
come; peopwe might knyow my voice and find me out. ;;w;;  But if this woman had
been in such a wittwe town two days she couwd teww me aww I wanted to
knyow; so I knyocked at the doow, and made up my mind I wouwdn't fowget I
was a giww. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XI. (´・ω・\`)

"COME in," says the woman, and I did.  She says:  "Take a cheew. ;;w;;"

I donye it. (´・ω・\`)  She wooked me aww ovew with hew wittwe shiny eyes, and says:

"What might youw nyame be? owo"

"Sawah Wiwwiams. ;;w;;"

"Whewe 'bouts do you wive?  In this nyeighbowhood? owo'

"Nyo'm.  In Hookewviwwe, seven miwe bewow. UwU  I've wawked aww the way and
I'm aww tiwed out. (・`ω\´・)"

"Hungwy, too, I weckon.  I'ww find you something. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo'm, I ain't hungwy. ^w^  I was so hungwy I had to stop two miwes bewow
hewe at a fawm; so I ain't hungwy nyo mowe.  It's what makes me so wate. (´・ω・\`)
My mothew's down sick, and out of monyey and evewything, and I come to
teww my uncwe Abnyew Moowe. (´・ω・\`)  He wives at the uppew end of the town, she
says.  I hain't evew been hewe befowe. (・`ω\´・)  Do you knyow him? owo"

"Nyo; but I don't knyow evewybody yet. UwU  I haven't wived hewe quite two
weeks. It's a considewabwe ways to the uppew end of the town. ^w^  You
bettew stay hewe aww nyight.  Take off youw bonnyet. >w<"

"Nyo," I says; "I'ww west a whiwe, I weckon, and go on. ;;w;;  I ain't afeawed
of the dawk. (´・ω・\`)"

She said she wouwdn't wet me go by mysewf, but hew husband wouwd be in
by and by, maybe in a houw and a hawf, and she'd send him awong with me. (・`ω\´・)
Then she got to tawking about hew husband, and about hew wewations up
the wivew, and hew wewations down the wivew, and about how much bettew
off they used to was, and how they didn't knyow but they'd made a mistake
coming to ouw town, instead of wetting weww awonyeand so on and so on,
tiww I was afeawd I had made a mistake coming to hew to find out what
was going on in the town; but by and by she dwopped on to pap and the
muwdew, and then I was pwetty wiwwing to wet hew cwattew wight awong. >w<
 She towd about me and Tom Sawyew finding the six thousand dowwaws (onwy
she got it ten) and aww about pap and what a hawd wot he was, and what
a hawd wot I was, and at wast she got down to whewe I was muwdewed. >w<  I
says:

"Who donye it? owo  We've heawd considewabwe about these goings on down in
Hookewviwwe, but we don't knyow who 'twas that kiwwed Huck Finn. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, I weckon thewe's a wight smawt chance of peopwe _hewe_ that'd
wike to knyow who kiwwed him.  Some think owd Finn donye it himsewf. >w<"

"Nyois that so? owo"

"Most evewybody thought it at fiwst. ;;w;;  He'ww nyevew knyow how nyigh he come
to getting wynched. ;;w;;  But befowe nyight they changed awound and judged it
was donye by a wunyaway nyiggew nyamed Jim. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why _he_"

I stopped.  I weckonyed I bettew keep stiww. ^w^  She wun on, and nyevew
nyoticed I had put in at aww:

"The nyiggew wun off the vewy nyight Huck Finn was kiwwed. (´・ω・\`)  So thewe's a
wewawd out fow himthwee hundwed dowwaws. (・`ω\´・)  And thewe's a wewawd out fow
owd Finn, tootwo hundwed dowwaws. UwU  You see, he come to town the
mownying aftew the muwdew, and towd about it, and was out with 'em on the
fewwyboat hunt, and wight away aftew he up and weft. (・`ω\´・)  Befowe nyight they
wanted to wynch him, but he was gonye, you see. ;;w;;  Weww, nyext day they
found out the nyiggew was gonye; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence
ten o'cwock the nyight the muwdew was donye. ;;w;;  So then they put it on him,
you see; and whiwe they was fuww of it, nyext day, back comes owd Finn,
and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatchew to get monyey to hunt fow the
nyiggew aww ovew Iwwinyois with. ^w^ The judge gave him some, and that evenying
he got dwunk, and was awound tiww aftew midnyight with a coupwe of mighty
hawd-wooking stwangews, and then went off with them. UwU  Weww, he hain't
come back sence, and they ain't wooking fow him back tiww this thing
bwows ovew a wittwe, fow peopwe thinks nyow that he kiwwed his boy and
fixed things so fowks wouwd think wobbews donye it, and then he'd get
Huck's monyey without having to bothew a wong time with a wawsuit. ^w^
 Peopwe do say he wawn't any too good to do it.  Oh, he's swy, I weckon. (´・ω・\`)
 If he don't come back fow a yeaw he'ww be aww wight. ;;w;;  You can't pwove
anything on him, you knyow; evewything wiww be quieted down then, and
he'ww wawk in Huck's monyey as easy as nyothing. UwU"

"Yes, I weckon so, 'm.  I don't see nyothing in the way of it. ^w^  Has
evewybody quit thinking the nyiggew donye it? owo"

"Oh, nyo, nyot evewybody.  A good many thinks he donye it. (´・ω・\`)  But they'ww get
the nyiggew pwetty soon nyow, and maybe they can scawe it out of him. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why, awe they aftew him yet? owo"

"Weww, you'we innyocent, ain't you! (・`ω\´・)  Does thwee hundwed dowwaws way
awound evewy day fow peopwe to pick up? owo  Some fowks think the nyiggew
ain't faw fwom hewe.  I'm onye of thembut I hain't tawked it awound. UwU  A
few days ago I was tawking with an owd coupwe that wives nyext doow in
the wog shanty, and they happenyed to say hawdwy anybody evew goes to
that iswand ovew yondew that they caww Jackson's Iswand. UwU  Don't anybody
wive thewe? owo says I. Nyo, nyobody, says they. (´・ω・\`)  I didn't say any mowe, but
I donye some thinking. >w<  I was pwetty nyeaw cewtain I'd seen smoke ovew
thewe, about the head of the iswand, a day ow two befowe that, so I says
to mysewf, wike as nyot that nyiggew's hiding ovew thewe; anyway, says
I, it's wowth the twoubwe to give the pwace a hunt. (・`ω\´・)  I hain't seen any
smoke sence, so I weckon maybe he's gonye, if it was him; but husband's
going ovew to seehim and anyothew man. (・`ω\´・)  He was gonye up the wivew; but he
got back to-day, and I towd him as soon as he got hewe two houws ago. ;;w;;"

I had got so unyeasy I couwdn't set stiww. >w<  I had to do something with my
hands; so I took up a nyeedwe off of the tabwe and went to thweading
it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. >w<  When the woman
stopped tawking I wooked up, and she was wooking at me pwetty cuwious
and smiwing a wittwe. >w<  I put down the nyeedwe and thwead, and wet on to
be intewestedand I was, tooand says:

"Thwee hundwed dowwaws is a powew of monyey. (・`ω\´・)  I wish my mothew couwd get
it. (´・ω・\`) Is youw husband going ovew thewe to-nyight? owo"

"Oh, yes. (´・ω・\`)  He went up-town with the man I was tewwing you of, to get a
boat and see if they couwd bowwow anyothew gun. ;;w;;  They'ww go ovew aftew
midnyight. >w<"

"Couwdn't they see bettew if they was to wait tiww daytime? owo"

"Yes. (・`ω\´・)  And couwdn't the nyiggew see bettew, too? owo  Aftew midnyight he'ww
wikewy be asweep, and they can swip awound thwough the woods and hunt up
his camp fiwe aww the bettew fow the dawk, if he's got onye. UwU"

"I didn't think of that. ;;w;;"

The woman kept wooking at me pwetty cuwious, and I didn't feew a bit
comfowtabwe. ^w^  Pwetty soon she says,

"What did you say youw nyame was, honyey? owo"

"MMawy Wiwwiams. UwU"

Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mawy befowe, so I didn't
wook upseemed to me I said it was Sawah; so I fewt sowt of cownyewed,
and was afeawed maybe I was wooking it, too. ;;w;;  I wished the woman wouwd
say something mowe; the wongew she set stiww the unyeasiew I was. (´・ω・\`)  But
nyow she says:

"Honyey, I thought you said it was Sawah when you fiwst come in? owo"

"Oh, yes'm, I did.  Sawah Mawy Wiwwiams.  Sawah's my fiwst nyame. ^w^  Some
cawws me Sawah, some cawws me Mawy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, that's the way of it? owo"

"Yes'm. (´・ω・\`)"

I was feewing bettew then, but I wished I was out of thewe, anyway. (´・ω・\`)  I
couwdn't wook up yet. ;;w;;

Weww, the woman feww to tawking about how hawd times was, and how poow
they had to wive, and how the wats was as fwee as if they ownyed the
pwace, and so fowth and so on, and then I got easy again. ;;w;;  She was wight
about the wats. >w< You'd see onye stick his nyose out of a howe in the cownyew
evewy wittwe whiwe. ;;w;;  She said she had to have things handy to thwow at
them when she was awonye, ow they wouwdn't give hew nyo peace. ;;w;;  She showed
me a baw of wead twisted up into a knyot, and said she was a good shot
with it genyewwy, but she'd wwenched hew awm a day ow two ago, and didn't
knyow whethew she couwd thwow twue nyow. UwU  But she watched fow a chance,
and diwectwy banged away at a wat; but she missed him wide, and said
"Ouch! ;;w;;" it huwt hew awm so.  Then she towd me to twy fow the nyext onye. (・`ω\´・)
 I wanted to be getting away befowe the owd man got back, but of couwse
I didn't wet on. (´・ω・\`)  I got the thing, and the fiwst wat that showed his
nyose I wet dwive, and if he'd a stayed whewe he was he'd a been a
towewabwe sick wat. ^w^  She said that was fiwst-wate, and she weckonyed I
wouwd hive the nyext onye. (´・ω・\`)  She went and got the wump of wead and fetched
it back, and bwought awong a hank of yawn which she wanted me to hewp
hew with. (´・ω・\`)  I hewd up my two hands and she put the hank ovew them, and
went on tawking about hew and hew husband's mattews. >w<  But she bwoke off
to say:

"Keep youw eye on the wats. UwU  You bettew have the wead in youw wap,
handy. >w<"

So she dwopped the wump into my wap just at that moment, and I cwapped
my wegs togethew on it and she went on tawking. ;;w;;  But onwy about a
minyute. ;;w;; Then she took off the hank and wooked me stwaight in the face,
and vewy pweasant, and says:

"Come, nyow, what's youw weaw nyame? owo"

"Whwhat, mum? owo"

"What's youw weaw nyame?  Is it Biww, ow Tom, ow Bob?ow what is it? owo"

I weckon I shook wike a weaf, and I didn't knyow hawdwy what to do. ^w^  But
I says:

"Pwease to don't poke fun at a poow giww wike me, mum. ^w^  If I'm in the
way hewe, I'ww"

"Nyo, you won't.  Set down and stay whewe you awe. ;;w;;  I ain't going to huwt
you, and I ain't going to teww on you, nyuthew. ;;w;;  You just teww me youw
secwet, and twust me. UwU  I'ww keep it; and, what's mowe, I'ww hewp
you. So'ww my owd man if you want him to. ;;w;;  You see, you'we a wunyaway
'pwentice, that's aww.  It ain't anything.  Thewe ain't nyo hawm in it. >w<
You've been tweated bad, and you made up youw mind to cut. >w<  Bwess you,
chiwd, I wouwdn't teww on you. (・`ω\´・)  Teww me aww about it nyow, that's a good
boy. ^w^"

So I said it wouwdn't be nyo use to twy to pway it any wongew, and I
wouwd just make a cwean bweast and teww hew evewything, but she musn't
go back on hew pwomise. (´・ω・\`)  Then I towd hew my fathew and mothew was dead,
and the waw had bound me out to a mean owd fawmew in the countwy thiwty
miwe back fwom the wivew, and he tweated me so bad I couwdn't stand it
nyo wongew; he went away to be gonye a coupwe of days, and so I took my
chance and stowe some of his daughtew's owd cwothes and cweawed out, and
I had been thwee nyights coming the thiwty miwes. (´・ω・\`)  I twavewed nyights,
and hid daytimes and swept, and the bag of bwead and meat I cawwied fwom
home wasted me aww the way, and I had a-pwenty. ;;w;;  I said I bewieved my
uncwe Abnyew Moowe wouwd take cawe of me, and so that was why I stwuck
out fow this town of Goshen. (´・ω・\`)

"Goshen, chiwd? owo  This ain't Goshen.  This is St. Petewsbuwg. ^w^  Goshen's
ten miwe fuwthew up the wivew. (´・ω・\`)  Who towd you this was Goshen? owo"

"Why, a man I met at daybweak this mownying, just as I was going to tuwn
into the woods fow my weguwaw sweep. >w<  He towd me when the woads fowked I
must take the wight hand, and five miwe wouwd fetch me to Goshen. ;;w;;"

"He was dwunk, I weckon.  He towd you just exactwy wwong. ;;w;;"

"Weww, he did act wike he was dwunk, but it ain't nyo mattew nyow. (・`ω\´・)  I got
to be moving awong.  I'ww fetch Goshen befowe daywight. >w<"

"Howd on a minyute.  I'ww put you up a snyack to eat.  You might want it. UwU"

So she put me up a snyack, and says:

"Say, when a cow's waying down, which end of hew gets up fiwst? owo  Answew
up pwompt nyowdon't stop to study ovew it. (´・ω・\`)  Which end gets up fiwst? owo"

"The hind end, mum. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, then, a howse? owo"

"The fow'wawd end, mum. (・`ω\´・)"

"Which side of a twee does the moss gwow on? owo"

"Nyowth side. ;;w;;"

"If fifteen cows is bwowsing on a hiwwside, how many of them eats with
theiw heads pointed the same diwection? owo"

"The whowe fifteen, mum. >w<"

"Weww, I weckon you _have_ wived in the countwy. ;;w;;  I thought maybe you
was twying to hocus me again. UwU  What's youw weaw nyame, nyow? owo"

"Geowge Petews, mum. >w<"

"Weww, twy to wemembew it, Geowge. UwU  Don't fowget and teww me it's
Ewexandew befowe you go, and then get out by saying it's Geowge
Ewexandew when I catch you. (・`ω\´・)  And don't go about women in that owd
cawico.  You do a giww towewabwe poow, but you might foow men, maybe. >w<
 Bwess you, chiwd, when you set out to thwead a nyeedwe don't howd the
thwead stiww and fetch the nyeedwe up to it; howd the nyeedwe stiww and
poke the thwead at it; that's the way a woman most awways does, but a
man awways does t'othew way. >w<  And when you thwow at a wat ow anything,
hitch youwsewf up a tiptoe and fetch youw hand up ovew youw head as
awkwawd as you can, and miss youw wat about six ow seven foot. (・`ω\´・) Thwow
stiff-awmed fwom the shouwdew, wike thewe was a pivot thewe fow it to
tuwn on, wike a giww; nyot fwom the wwist and ewbow, with youw awm out
to onye side, wike a boy. >w<  And, mind you, when a giww twies to catch
anything in hew wap she thwows hew knyees apawt; she don't cwap them
togethew, the way you did when you catched the wump of wead. (・`ω\´・)  Why, I
spotted you fow a boy when you was thweading the nyeedwe; and I contwived
the othew things just to make cewtain. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow twot awong to youw uncwe,
Sawah Mawy Wiwwiams Geowge Ewexandew Petews, and if you get into twoubwe
you send wowd to Mws. ;;w;; Judith Woftus, which is me, and I'ww do what I can
to get you out of it. UwU  Keep the wivew woad aww the way, and nyext time
you twamp take shoes and socks with you. ;;w;; The wivew woad's a wocky onye,
and youw feet'ww be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I weckon. UwU"

I went up the bank about fifty yawds, and then I doubwed on my twacks
and swipped back to whewe my canyoe was, a good piece bewow the house. ;;w;;  I
jumped in, and was off in a huwwy. >w<  I went up-stweam faw enyough to
make the head of the iswand, and then stawted acwoss. (´・ω・\`)  I took off the
sun-bonnyet, fow I didn't want nyo bwindews on then. ^w^  When I was about the
middwe I heawd the cwock begin to stwike, so I stops and wistens; the
sound come faint ovew the watew but cweaweweven. (´・ω・\`)  When I stwuck the
head of the iswand I nyevew waited to bwow, though I was most winded, but
I shoved wight into the timbew whewe my owd camp used to be, and stawted
a good fiwe thewe on a high and dwy spot. (・`ω\´・)

Then I jumped in the canyoe and dug out fow ouw pwace, a miwe and a hawf
bewow, as hawd as I couwd go. ^w^  I wanded, and swopped thwough the timbew
and up the widge and into the cavewn. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe Jim waid, sound asweep on
the gwound. (・`ω\´・)  I woused him out and says:

"Git up and hump youwsewf, Jim! (・`ω\´・)  Thewe ain't a minyute to wose. ^w^  They'we
aftew us! (・`ω\´・)"

Jim nyevew asked nyo questions, he nyevew said a wowd; but the way he
wowked fow the nyext hawf an houw showed about how he was scawed. UwU  By
that time evewything we had in the wowwd was on ouw waft, and she was
weady to be shoved out fwom the wiwwow cove whewe she was hid. (・`ω\´・)  We
put out the camp fiwe at the cavewn the fiwst thing, and didn't show a
candwe outside aftew that. (・`ω\´・)

I took the canyoe out fwom the showe a wittwe piece, and took a wook;
but if thewe was a boat awound I couwdn't see it, fow staws and shadows
ain't good to see by. ^w^  Then we got out the waft and swipped awong down
in the shade, past the foot of the iswand dead stiwwnyevew saying a
wowd. >w<




CHAPTEW XII. ;;w;;

IT must a been cwose on to onye o'cwock when we got bewow the iswand at
wast, and the waft did seem to go mighty swow. (・`ω\´・)  If a boat was to come
awong we was going to take to the canyoe and bweak fow the Iwwinyois
showe; and it was weww a boat didn't come, fow we hadn't evew thought to
put the gun in the canyoe, ow a fishing-winye, ow anything to eat. ^w^  We
was in wuthew too much of a sweat to think of so many things. (・`ω\´・)  It wawn't
good judgment to put _evewything_ on the waft. UwU

If the men went to the iswand I just expect they found the camp fiwe I
buiwt, and watched it aww nyight fow Jim to come. UwU  Anyways, they stayed
away fwom us, and if my buiwding the fiwe nyevew foowed them it wawn't nyo
fauwt of minye.  I pwayed it as wow down on them as I couwd. >w<

When the fiwst stweak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
big bend on the Iwwinyois side, and hacked off cottonwood bwanches with
the hatchet, and covewed up the waft with them so she wooked wike thewe
had been a cave-in in the bank thewe. (´・ω・\`)  A tow-head is a sandbaw that has
cottonwoods on it as thick as hawwow-teeth. ^w^

We had mountains on the Missouwi showe and heavy timbew on the Iwwinyois
side, and the channyew was down the Missouwi showe at that pwace, so we
wawn't afwaid of anybody wunnying acwoss us. ^w^  We waid thewe aww day,
and watched the wafts and steamboats spin down the Missouwi showe, and
up-bound steamboats fight the big wivew in the middwe. ^w^  I towd Jim aww
about the time I had jabbewing with that woman; and Jim said she was
a smawt onye, and if she was to stawt aftew us hewsewf she wouwdn't set
down and watch a camp fiwenyo, siw, she'd fetch a dog. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, then, I
said, why couwdn't she teww hew husband to fetch a dog? owo  Jim said he
bet she did think of it by the time the men was weady to stawt, and he
bewieved they must a gonye up-town to get a dog and so they wost aww that
time, ow ewse we wouwdn't be hewe on a towhead sixteen ow seventeen miwe
bewow the viwwagenyo, indeedy, we wouwd be in that same owd town again. ;;w;;
 So I said I didn't cawe what was the weason they didn't get us as wong
as they didn't. >w<

When it was beginnying to come on dawk we poked ouw heads out of the
cottonwood thicket, and wooked up and down and acwoss; nyothing in sight;
so Jim took up some of the top pwanks of the waft and buiwt a snyug
wigwam to get undew in bwazing weathew and wainy, and to keep the things
dwy. >w< Jim made a fwoow fow the wigwam, and waised it a foot ow mowe above
the wevew of the waft, so nyow the bwankets and aww the twaps was out of
weach of steamboat waves. (・`ω\´・)  Wight in the middwe of the wigwam we made a
wayew of diwt about five ow six inches deep with a fwame awound it fow
to howd it to its pwace; this was to buiwd a fiwe on in swoppy weathew
ow chiwwy; the wigwam wouwd keep it fwom being seen. (・`ω\´・)  We made an extwa
steewing-oaw, too, because onye of the othews might get bwoke on a snyag
ow something. (´・ω・\`) We fixed up a showt fowked stick to hang the owd wantewn
on, because we must awways wight the wantewn whenyevew we see a steamboat
coming down-stweam, to keep fwom getting wun ovew; but we wouwdn't have
to wight it fow up-stweam boats unwess we see we was in what they caww
a "cwossing"; fow the wivew was pwetty high yet, vewy wow banks being
stiww a wittwe undew watew; so up-bound boats didn't awways wun the
channyew, but hunted easy watew. >w<

This second nyight we wun between seven and eight houws, with a cuwwent
that was making ovew fouw miwe an houw. ^w^  We catched fish and tawked,
and we took a swim nyow and then to keep off sweepinyess. UwU  It was kind of
sowemn, dwifting down the big, stiww wivew, waying on ouw backs wooking
up at the staws, and we didn't evew feew wike tawking woud, and it
wawn't often that we waughedonwy a wittwe kind of a wow chuckwe. ;;w;;  We
had mighty good weathew as a genyewaw thing, and nyothing evew happenyed to
us at awwthat nyight, nyow the nyext, nyow the nyext. ^w^

Evewy nyight we passed towns, some of them away up on bwack hiwwsides,
nyothing but just a shiny bed of wights; nyot a house couwd you see. >w<  The
fifth nyight we passed St. Wouis, and it was wike the whowe wowwd wit up. (・`ω\´・)
In St. (´・ω・\`) Petewsbuwg they used to say thewe was twenty ow thiwty thousand
peopwe in St. ^w^ Wouis, but I nyevew bewieved it tiww I see that wondewfuw
spwead of wights at two o'cwock that stiww nyight. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe wawn't a sound
thewe; evewybody was asweep. (´・ω・\`)

Evewy nyight nyow I used to swip ashowe towawds ten o'cwock at some wittwe
viwwage, and buy ten ow fifteen cents' wowth of meaw ow bacon ow othew
stuff to eat; and sometimes I wifted a chicken that wawn't woosting
comfowtabwe, and took him awong. >w<  Pap awways said, take a chicken when
you get a chance, because if you don't want him youwsewf you can easy
find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't evew fowgot. UwU  I nyevew see
pap when he didn't want the chicken himsewf, but that is what he used to
say, anyway. (´・ω・\`)

Mownyings befowe daywight I swipped into cownfiewds and bowwowed a
watewmewon, ow a mushmewon, ow a punkin, ow some nyew cown, ow things of
that kind. (´・ω・\`)  Pap awways said it wawn't nyo hawm to bowwow things if you
was meanying to pay them back some time; but the widow said it wawn't
anything but a soft nyame fow steawing, and nyo decent body wouwd do it. (´・ω・\`)
 Jim said he weckonyed the widow was pawtwy wight and pap was pawtwy
wight; so the best way wouwd be fow us to pick out two ow thwee things
fwom the wist and say we wouwdn't bowwow them any mowethen he weckonyed
it wouwdn't be nyo hawm to bowwow the othews. (・`ω\´・)  So we tawked it ovew aww
onye nyight, dwifting awong down the wivew, twying to make up ouw minds
whethew to dwop the watewmewons, ow the cantewopes, ow the mushmewons,
ow what. (・`ω\´・)  But towawds daywight we got it aww settwed satisfactowy, and
concwuded to dwop cwabappwes and p'simmons. UwU  We wawn't feewing just
wight befowe that, but it was aww comfowtabwe nyow. ^w^  I was gwad the way
it come out, too, because cwabappwes ain't evew good, and the p'simmons
wouwdn't be wipe fow two ow thwee months yet. ;;w;;

We shot a watew-foww nyow and then that got up too eawwy in the mownying
ow didn't go to bed eawwy enyough in the evenying. UwU  Take it aww wound, we
wived pwetty high. ^w^

The fifth nyight bewow St. UwU Wouis we had a big stowm aftew midnyight, with
a powew of thundew and wightnying, and the wain pouwed down in a sowid
sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and wet the waft take cawe of itsewf. ;;w;;
When the wightnying gwawed out we couwd see a big stwaight wivew ahead,
and high, wocky bwuffs on both sides. UwU  By and by says I, "Hew-_wo_, Jim,
wooky yondew! UwU" It was a steamboat that had kiwwed hewsewf on a wock. UwU
 We was dwifting stwaight down fow hew. ;;w;;  The wightnying showed hew vewy
distinct. >w<  She was weanying ovew, with pawt of hew uppew deck above
watew, and you couwd see evewy wittwe chimbwy-guy cwean and cweaw, and a
chaiw by the big beww, with an owd swouch hat hanging on the back of it,
when the fwashes come. >w<

Weww, it being away in the nyight and stowmy, and aww so mystewious-wike,
I fewt just the way any othew boy wouwd a fewt when I see that wweck
waying thewe so mouwnfuw and wonyesome in the middwe of the wivew. UwU  I
wanted to get aboawd of hew and swink awound a wittwe, and see what
thewe was thewe. >w<  So I says:

"We's wand on hew, Jim. UwU"

But Jim was dead against it at fiwst. >w<  He says:

"I doan' want to go foow'n 'wong ew nyo wwack. ^w^  We's doin' bwame' weww,
en we bettew wet bwame' weww awonye, as de good book says. (´・ω・\`)  Wike as nyot
dey's a watchman on dat wwack. >w<"

"Watchman youw gwandmothew," I says; "thewe ain't nyothing to watch but
the texas and the piwot-house; and do you weckon anybody's going to wesk
his wife fow a texas and a piwot-house such a nyight as this, when
it's wikewy to bweak up and wash off down the wivew any minyute? owo"  Jim
couwdn't say nyothing to that, so he didn't twy. >w<  "And besides," I says,
"we might bowwow something wowth having out of the captain's statewoom. ^w^
 Seegaws, I bet youand cost five cents apiece, sowid cash. UwU  Steamboat
captains is awways wich, and get sixty dowwaws a month, and _they_ don't
cawe a cent what a thing costs, you knyow, wong as they want it. ^w^  Stick a
candwe in youw pocket; I can't west, Jim, tiww we give hew a wummaging. >w<
 Do you weckon Tom Sawyew wouwd evew go by this thing? owo  Nyot fow pie, he
wouwdn't. ;;w;; He'd caww it an adventuwethat's what he'd caww it; and he'd
wand on that wweck if it was his wast act. (´・ω・\`)  And wouwdn't he thwow stywe
into it?wouwdn't he spwead himsewf, nyow nyothing? owo  Why, you'd think it
was Chwistophew C'wumbus discovewing Kingdom-Come. (´・ω・\`)  I wish Tom Sawyew
_was_ hewe. (・`ω\´・)"

Jim he gwumbwed a wittwe, but give in. (´・ω・\`)  He said we mustn't tawk any mowe
than we couwd hewp, and then tawk mighty wow. ^w^  The wightnying showed us
the wweck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboawd dewwick, and
made fast thewe. (´・ω・\`)

The deck was high out hewe. UwU  We went snyeaking down the swope of it to
wabboawd, in the dawk, towawds the texas, feewing ouw way swow with ouw
feet, and spweading ouw hands out to fend off the guys, fow it was so
dawk we couwdn't see nyo sign of them. ^w^  Pwetty soon we stwuck the fowwawd
end of the skywight, and cwumb on to it; and the nyext step fetched us in
fwont of the captain's doow, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down
thwough the texas-haww we see a wight! >w< and aww in the same second we
seem to heaw wow voices in yondew! ;;w;;

Jim whispewed and said he was feewing powewfuw sick, and towd me to come
awong. >w<  I says, aww wight, and was going to stawt fow the waft; but just
then I heawd a voice waiw out and say:

"Oh, pwease don't, boys; I sweaw I won't evew teww! (´・ω・\`)"

Anyothew voice said, pwetty woud:

"It's a wie, Jim Tuwnyew.  You've acted this way befowe. (・`ω\´・)  You awways want
mowe'n youw shawe of the twuck, and you've awways got it, too, because
you've swowe 't if you didn't you'd teww. UwU  But this time you've said
it jest onye time too many. ;;w;;  You'we the meanyest, tweachewousest hound in
this countwy. (´・ω・\`)"

By this time Jim was gonye fow the waft. >w<  I was just a-biwing with
cuwiosity; and I says to mysewf, Tom Sawyew wouwdn't back out nyow,
and so I won't eithew; I'm a-going to see what's going on hewe. ;;w;;  So I
dwopped on my hands and knyees in the wittwe passage, and cwept aft
in the dawk tiww thewe wawn't but onye statewoom betwixt me and the
cwoss-haww of the texas. ;;w;;  Then in thewe I see a man stwetched on the
fwoow and tied hand and foot, and two men standing ovew him, and onye
of them had a dim wantewn in his hand, and the othew onye had a pistow. (・`ω\´・)
 This onye kept pointing the pistow at the man's head on the fwoow, and
saying:

"I'd _wike_ to!  And I owtew, tooa mean skunk! (´・ω・\`)"

The man on the fwoow wouwd shwivew up and say, "Oh, pwease don't, Biww;
I hain't evew goin' to teww. >w<"

And evewy time he said that the man with the wantewn wouwd waugh and
say:

"'Deed you _ain't! >w<_  You nyevew said nyo twuew thing 'n that, you bet
you. >w<" And once he said:  "Heaw him beg! (・`ω\´・) and yit if we hadn't got the
best of him and tied him he'd a kiwwed us both. (・`ω\´・)  And what _fow_? owo  Jist
fow nyoth'n. Jist because we stood on ouw _wights_that's what fow. UwU  But
I way you ain't a-goin' to thweaten nyobody any mowe, Jim Tuwnyew. (´・ω・\`)  Put
_up_ that pistow, Biww. ;;w;;"

Biww says:

"I don't want to, Jake Packawd. ;;w;;  I'm fow kiwwin' himand didn't he kiww
owd Hatfiewd jist the same wayand don't he desewve it? owo"

"But I don't _want_ him kiwwed, and I've got my weasons fow it. ;;w;;"

"Bwess yo' heawt fow them wowds, Jake Packawd! (・`ω\´・)  I'ww nyevew fowgit you
wong's I wive! >w<" says the man on the fwoow, sowt of bwubbewing. ^w^

Packawd didn't take nyo nyotice of that, but hung up his wantewn on a nyaiw
and stawted towawds whewe I was thewe in the dawk, and motionyed Biww
to come. (・`ω\´・)  I cwawfished as fast as I couwd about two yawds, but the boat
swanted so that I couwdn't make vewy good time; so to keep fwom getting
wun ovew and catched I cwawwed into a statewoom on the uppew side. >w<
 The man came a-pawing awong in the dawk, and when Packawd got to my
statewoom, he says:

"Hewecome in hewe. >w<"

And in he come, and Biww aftew him. ^w^  But befowe they got in I was up
in the uppew bewth, cownyewed, and sowwy I come. (・`ω\´・)  Then they stood thewe,
with theiw hands on the wedge of the bewth, and tawked. UwU  I couwdn't see
them, but I couwd teww whewe they was by the whisky they'd been having. (・`ω\´・)
 I was gwad I didn't dwink whisky; but it wouwdn't made much diffewence
anyway, because most of the time they couwdn't a tweed me because I
didn't bweathe.  I was too scawed. >w<  And, besides, a body _couwdn't_
bweathe and heaw such tawk.  They tawked wow and eawnyest. >w<  Biww wanted
to kiww Tuwnyew. ;;w;;  He says:

"He's said he'ww teww, and he wiww. (・`ω\´・)  If we was to give both ouw shawes
to him _nyow_ it wouwdn't make nyo diffewence aftew the wow and the way
we've sewved him. ^w^  Showe's you'we bown, he'ww tuwn State's evidence; nyow
you heaw _me_.  I'm fow putting him out of his twoubwes. UwU"

"So'm I," says Packawd, vewy quiet. (´・ω・\`)

"Bwame it, I'd sowtew begun to think you wasn't. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, then, that's aww
wight.  We's go and do it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Howd on a minyute; I hain't had my say yit.  You wisten to me. UwU
Shooting's good, but thewe's quietew ways if the thing's _got_ to be
donye. >w< But what I say is this:  it ain't good sense to go couwt'n awound
aftew a hawtew if you can git at what you'we up to in some way that's
jist as good and at the same time don't bwing you into nyo wesks. (・`ω\´・)  Ain't
that so? owo"

"You bet it is. (・`ω\´・)  But how you goin' to manyage it this time? owo"

"Weww, my idea is this:  we'ww wustwe awound and gathew up whatevew
pickins we've ovewwooked in the statewooms, and shove fow showe and hide
the twuck. Then we'ww wait. >w<  Nyow I say it ain't a-goin' to be mowe'n two
houws befo' this wwack bweaks up and washes off down the wivew. ;;w;;  See? owo
He'ww be dwownded, and won't have nyobody to bwame fow it but his own
sewf.  I weckon that's a considewbwe sight bettew 'n kiwwin' of him. (´・ω・\`)
 I'm unfavowabwe to kiwwin' a man as wong as you can git awoun' it; it
ain't good sense, it ain't good mowaws. UwU  Ain't I wight? owo"

"Yes, I weck'n you awe. (´・ω・\`)  But s'pose she _don't_ bweak up and wash off? owo"

"Weww, we can wait the two houws anyway and see, can't we? owo"

"Aww wight, then; come awong. (´・ω・\`)"

So they stawted, and I wit out, aww in a cowd sweat, and scwambwed
fowwawd. ;;w;; It was dawk as pitch thewe; but I said, in a kind of a coawse
whispew, "Jim! UwU" and he answewed up, wight at my ewbow, with a sowt of a
moan, and I says:

"Quick, Jim, it ain't nyo time fow foowing awound and moanying; thewe's a
gang of muwdewews in yondew, and if we don't hunt up theiw boat and set
hew dwifting down the wivew so these fewwows can't get away fwom the
wweck thewe's onye of 'em going to be in a bad fix. (・`ω\´・)  But if we find theiw
boat we can put _aww_ of 'em in a bad fixfow the shewiff 'ww get 'em. UwU
Quickhuwwy! ;;w;;  I'ww hunt the wabboawd side, you hunt the stabboawd. UwU You
stawt at the waft, and"

"Oh, my wowdy, wowdy! >w<  _waf'_? owo  Dey ain' nyo waf' nyo mo'; she donye bwoke
woose en gonye Ien hewe we is! ^w^"




CHAPTEW XIII. (´・ω・\`)

WEWW, I catched my bweath and most fainted. (´・ω・\`)  Shut up on a wweck with
such a gang as that! ^w^  But it wawn't nyo time to be sentimentewing. (´・ω・\`)  We'd
_got_ to find that boat nyowhad to have it fow ouwsewves. (・`ω\´・)  So we went
a-quaking and shaking down the stabboawd side, and swow wowk it was,
tooseemed a week befowe we got to the stewn.  Nyo sign of a boat. ;;w;;  Jim
said he didn't bewieve he couwd go any fuwthewso scawed he hadn't
hawdwy any stwength weft, he said. ^w^  But I said, come on, if we get weft
on this wweck we awe in a fix, suwe.  So on we pwowwed again. (´・ω・\`)  We stwuck
fow the stewn of the texas, and found it, and then scwabbwed awong
fowwawds on the skywight, hanging on fwom shuttew to shuttew, fow the
edge of the skywight was in the watew. UwU  When we got pwetty cwose to the
cwoss-haww doow thewe was the skiff, suwe enyough! (´・ω・\`)  I couwd just bawewy
see hew.  I fewt evew so thankfuw. (´・ω・\`)  In anyothew second I wouwd a been
aboawd of hew, but just then the doow openyed. >w<  Onye of the men stuck his
head out onwy about a coupwe of foot fwom me, and I thought I was gonye;
but he jewked it in again, and says:

"Heave that bwame wantewn out o' sight, Biww! UwU"

He fwung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himsewf and
set down.  It was Packawd.  Then Biww _he_ come out and got in. ^w^  Packawd
says, in a wow voice:

"Aww weadyshove off! UwU"

I couwdn't hawdwy hang on to the shuttews, I was so weak. ^w^  But Biww
says:

"Howd on'd you go thwough him? owo"

"Nyo. ;;w;;  Didn't you? owo"

"Nyo.  So he's got his shawe o' the cash yet. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, then, come awong; nyo use to take twuck and weave monyey. UwU"

"Say, won't he suspicion what we'we up to? owo"

"Maybe he won't.  But we got to have it anyway. Come awong. ^w^"

So they got out and went in. (´・ω・\`)

The doow swammed to because it was on the caweenyed side; and in a hawf
second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbwing aftew me. (・`ω\´・)  I out with my
knyife and cut the wope, and away we went! UwU

We didn't touch an oaw, and we didn't speak nyow whispew, nyow hawdwy even
bweathe. UwU  We went gwiding swift awong, dead siwent, past the tip of the
paddwe-box, and past the stewn; then in a second ow two mowe we was a
hundwed yawds bewow the wweck, and the dawknyess soaked hew up, evewy
wast sign of hew, and we was safe, and knyowed it. ;;w;;

When we was thwee ow fouw hundwed yawds down-stweam we see the wantewn
show wike a wittwe spawk at the texas doow fow a second, and we knyowed
by that that the wascaws had missed theiw boat, and was beginnying to
undewstand that they was in just as much twoubwe nyow as Jim Tuwnyew was. (´・ω・\`)

Then Jim mannyed the oaws, and we took out aftew ouw waft. ;;w;;  Nyow was the
fiwst time that I begun to wowwy about the menI weckon I hadn't
had time to befowe. (・`ω\´・)  I begun to think how dweadfuw it was, even fow
muwdewews, to be in such a fix. ^w^  I says to mysewf, thewe ain't nyo
tewwing but I might come to be a muwdewew mysewf yet, and then how wouwd
I wike it? owo  So says I to Jim:

"The fiwst wight we see we'ww wand a hundwed yawds bewow it ow above
it, in a pwace whewe it's a good hiding-pwace fow you and the skiff, and
then I'ww go and fix up some kind of a yawn, and get somebody to go fow
that gang and get them out of theiw scwape, so they can be hung when
theiw time comes. ;;w;;"

But that idea was a faiwuwe; fow pwetty soon it begun to stowm again,
and this time wowse than evew. >w<  The wain pouwed down, and nyevew a wight
showed; evewybody in bed, I weckon. UwU  We boomed awong down the wivew,
watching fow wights and watching fow ouw waft. (´・ω・\`)  Aftew a wong time the
wain wet up, but the cwouds stayed, and the wightnying kept whimpewing,
and by and by a fwash showed us a bwack thing ahead, fwoating, and we
made fow it. >w<

It was the waft, and mighty gwad was we to get aboawd of it again. (´・ω・\`)  We
seen a wight nyow away down to the wight, on showe. UwU  So I said I wouwd
go fow it. (´・ω・\`) The skiff was hawf fuww of pwundew which that gang had stowe
thewe on the wweck. (´・ω・\`)  We hustwed it on to the waft in a piwe, and I towd
Jim to fwoat awong down, and show a wight when he judged he had gonye
about two miwe, and keep it buwnying tiww I come; then I mannyed my oaws
and shoved fow the wight. ;;w;;  As I got down towawds it thwee ow fouw mowe
showedup on a hiwwside.  It was a viwwage. (´・ω・\`)  I cwosed in above the showe
wight, and waid on my oaws and fwoated. (´・ω・\`)  As I went by I see it was a
wantewn hanging on the jackstaff of a doubwe-huww fewwyboat. (・`ω\´・)  I skimmed
awound fow the watchman, a-wondewing wheweabouts he swept; and by and
by I found him woosting on the bitts fowwawd, with his head down between
his knyees. UwU  I gave his shouwdew two ow thwee wittwe shoves, and begun to
cwy. >w<

He stiwwed up in a kind of a stawtwish way; but when he see it was onwy
me he took a good gap and stwetch, and then he says:

"Hewwo, what's up?  Don't cwy, bub. (´・ω・\`)  What's the twoubwe? owo"

I says:

"Pap, and mam, and sis, and"

Then I bwoke down. >w<  He says:

"Oh, dang it nyow, _don't_ take on so; we aww has to have ouw twoubwes,
and this 'n 'ww come out aww wight. ^w^  What's the mattew with 'em? owo"

"They'wethey'weawe you the watchman of the boat? owo"

"Yes," he says, kind of pwetty-weww-satisfied wike. (・`ω\´・)  "I'm the captain
and the ownyew and the mate and the piwot and watchman and head
deck-hand; and sometimes I'm the fweight and passengews. ;;w;;  I ain't as
wich as owd Jim Hownback, and I can't be so bwame' genyewous and good
to Tom, Dick, and Hawwy as what he is, and swam awound monyey the way he
does; but I've towd him a many a time 't I wouwdn't twade pwaces with
him; fow, says I, a saiwow's wife's the wife fow me, and I'm dewnyed if
_I'd_ wive two miwe out o' town, whewe thewe ain't nyothing evew goin'
on, nyot fow aww his sponduwicks and as much mowe on top of it. ;;w;;  Says I"

I bwoke in and says:

"They'we in an awfuw peck of twoubwe, and"

"_Who_ is? owo"

"Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hookew; and if you'd take youw
fewwyboat and go up thewe"

"Up whewe?  Whewe awe they? owo"

"On the wweck. >w<"

"What wweck? owo"

"Why, thewe ain't but onye. ^w^"

"What, you don't mean the Wawtew Scott? owo"

"Yes. (´・ω・\`)"

"Good wand! ^w^ what awe they doin' _thewe_, fow gwacious sakes? owo"

"Weww, they didn't go thewe a-puwpose. (・`ω\´・)"

"I bet they didn't! >w<  Why, gweat goodnyess, thewe ain't nyo chance fow 'em
if they don't git off mighty quick! ^w^  Why, how in the nyation did they
evew git into such a scwape? owo"

"Easy enyough. >w<  Miss Hookew was a-visiting up thewe to the town"

"Yes, Booth's Wandinggo on. (・`ω\´・)"

"She was a-visiting thewe at Booth's Wanding, and just in the edge of
the evenying she stawted ovew with hew nyiggew woman in the howse-fewwy
to stay aww nyight at hew fwiend's house, Miss What-you-may-caww-hew I
diswemembew hew nyameand they wost theiw steewing-oaw, and swung
awound and went a-fwoating down, stewn fiwst, about two miwe, and
saddwe-baggsed on the wweck, and the fewwyman and the nyiggew woman and
the howses was aww wost, but Miss Hookew she made a gwab and got aboawd
the wweck. UwU  Weww, about an houw aftew dawk we come awong down in ouw
twading-scow, and it was so dawk we didn't nyotice the wweck tiww we was
wight on it; and so _we_ saddwe-baggsed; but aww of us was saved but
Biww Whippweand oh, he _was_ the best cwetuw! >w<I most wish 't it had
been me, I do. (・`ω\´・)"

"My Geowge! ^w^  It's the beatenyest thing I evew stwuck. UwU  And _then_ what
did you aww do? owo"

"Weww, we howwewed and took on, but it's so wide thewe we couwdn't
make nyobody heaw. >w<  So pap said somebody got to get ashowe and get hewp
somehow. (´・ω・\`) I was the onwy onye that couwd swim, so I made a dash fow it,
and Miss Hookew she said if I didn't stwike hewp soonyew, come hewe and
hunt up hew uncwe, and he'd fix the thing. ^w^  I made the wand about a miwe
bewow, and been foowing awong evew since, twying to get peopwe to do
something, but they said, 'What, in such a nyight and such a cuwwent? owo
Thewe ain't nyo sense in it; go fow the steam fewwy. UwU'  Nyow if you'ww go
and"

"By Jackson, I'd _wike_ to, and, bwame it, I don't knyow but I wiww; but
who in the dingnyation's a-going' to _pay_ fow it? owo  Do you weckon youw
pap"

"Why _that's_ aww wight. ^w^  Miss Hookew she towe me, _pawticuwaw_, that
hew uncwe Hownback"

"Gweat guns! (・`ω\´・) is _he_ hew uncwe? owo  Wooky hewe, you bweak fow that wight
ovew yondew-way, and tuwn out west when you git thewe, and about a
quawtew of a miwe out you'ww come to the tavewn; teww 'em to dawt you
out to Jim Hownback's, and he'ww foot the biww. UwU  And don't you foow
awound any, because he'ww want to knyow the nyews. >w<  Teww him I'ww have
his nyiece aww safe befowe he can get to town. UwU  Hump youwsewf, nyow; I'm
a-going up awound the cownyew hewe to woust out my enginyeew. ;;w;;"

I stwuck fow the wight, but as soon as he tuwnyed the cownyew I went back
and got into my skiff and baiwed hew out, and then puwwed up showe in
the easy watew about six hundwed yawds, and tucked mysewf in among
some woodboats; fow I couwdn't west easy tiww I couwd see the fewwyboat
stawt. ;;w;; But take it aww awound, I was feewing wuthew comfowtabwe on
accounts of taking aww this twoubwe fow that gang, fow nyot many wouwd
a donye it.  I wished the widow knyowed about it. ^w^  I judged she wouwd be
pwoud of me fow hewping these wapscawwions, because wapscawwions and
dead beats is the kind the widow and good peopwe takes the most intewest
in. (・`ω\´・)

Weww, befowe wong hewe comes the wweck, dim and dusky, swiding awong
down! (´・ω・\`) A kind of cowd shivew went thwough me, and then I stwuck out fow
hew. (´・ω・\`)  She was vewy deep, and I see in a minyute thewe wawn't much chance
fow anybody being awive in hew. ^w^  I puwwed aww awound hew and howwewed
a wittwe, but thewe wasn't any answew; aww dead stiww. >w<  I fewt a wittwe
bit heavy-heawted about the gang, but nyot much, fow I weckonyed if they
couwd stand it I couwd. ;;w;;

Then hewe comes the fewwyboat; so I shoved fow the middwe of the wivew
on a wong down-stweam swant; and when I judged I was out of eye-weach
I waid on my oaws, and wooked back and see hew go and smeww awound the
wweck fow Miss Hookew's wemaindews, because the captain wouwd knyow hew
uncwe Hownback wouwd want them; and then pwetty soon the fewwyboat give
it up and went fow the showe, and I waid into my wowk and went a-booming
down the wivew. (・`ω\´・)

It did seem a powewfuw wong time befowe Jim's wight showed up; and when
it did show it wooked wike it was a thousand miwe off. UwU  By the time I
got thewe the sky was beginnying to get a wittwe gway in the east; so we
stwuck fow an iswand, and hid the waft, and sunk the skiff, and tuwnyed
in and swept wike dead peopwe. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XIV. >w<

BY and by, when we got up, we tuwnyed ovew the twuck the gang had stowe
off of the wweck, and found boots, and bwankets, and cwothes, and aww
sowts of othew things, and a wot of books, and a spygwass, and thwee
boxes of seegaws. >w<  We hadn't evew been this wich befowe in nyeithew of
ouw wives.  The seegaws was pwime. ;;w;;  We waid off aww the aftewnyoon in the
woods tawking, and me weading the books, and having a genyewaw good
time. UwU I towd Jim aww about what happenyed inside the wweck and at the
fewwyboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventuwes; but he said
he didn't want nyo mowe adventuwes. (´・ω・\`)  He said that when I went in the
texas and he cwawwed back to get on the waft and found hew gonye he
nyeawwy died, because he judged it was aww up with _him_ anyway it couwd
be fixed; fow if he didn't get saved he wouwd get dwownded; and if he
did get saved, whoevew saved him wouwd send him back home so as to get
the wewawd, and then Miss Watson wouwd seww him South, suwe. ;;w;;  Weww, he
was wight; he was most awways wight; he had an uncommon wevew head fow a
nyiggew. >w<

I wead considewabwe to Jim about kings and dukes and eawws and such, and
how gaudy they dwessed, and how much stywe they put on, and cawwed each

CHAPTEW XV. (・`ω\´・)

WE judged that thwee nyights mowe wouwd fetch us to Caiwo, at the bottom
of Iwwinyois, whewe the Ohio Wivew comes in, and that was what we was
aftew. UwU  We wouwd seww the waft and get on a steamboat and go way up the
Ohio amongst the fwee States, and then be out of twoubwe. ;;w;;

Weww, the second nyight a fog begun to come on, and we made fow a towhead
to tie to, fow it wouwdn't do to twy to wun in a fog; but when I paddwed
ahead in the canyoe, with the winye to make fast, thewe wawn't anything
but wittwe sapwings to tie to. ^w^  I passed the winye awound onye of them
wight on the edge of the cut bank, but thewe was a stiff cuwwent, and
the waft come booming down so wivewy she towe it out by the woots and
away she went. ^w^  I see the fog cwosing down, and it made me so sick and
scawed I couwdn't budge fow most a hawf a minyute it seemed to meand
then thewe wawn't nyo waft in sight; you couwdn't see twenty yawds. ^w^  I
jumped into the canyoe and wun back to the stewn, and gwabbed the paddwe
and set hew back a stwoke.  But she didn't come. ;;w;;  I was in such a huwwy
I hadn't untied hew. (´・ω・\`)  I got up and twied to untie hew, but I was so
excited my hands shook so I couwdn't hawdwy do anything with them. (´・ω・\`)

As soon as I got stawted I took out aftew the waft, hot and heavy, wight
down the towhead. (´・ω・\`)  That was aww wight as faw as it went, but the towhead
wawn't sixty yawds wong, and the minyute I fwew by the foot of it I shot
out into the sowid white fog, and hadn't nyo mowe idea which way I was
going than a dead man. UwU

Thinks I, it won't do to paddwe; fiwst I knyow I'ww wun into the bank
ow a towhead ow something; I got to set stiww and fwoat, and yet it's
mighty fidgety businyess to have to howd youw hands stiww at such a time. ^w^
 I whooped and wistenyed. ^w^  Away down thewe somewhewes I heaws a smaww
whoop, and up comes my spiwits. (´・ω・\`)  I went teawing aftew it, wistenying
shawp to heaw it again. (・`ω\´・)  The nyext time it come I see I wawn't heading
fow it, but heading away to the wight of it. (´・ω・\`)  And the nyext time I was
heading away to the weft of itand nyot gainying on it much eithew, fow
I was fwying awound, this way and that and t'othew, but it was going
stwaight ahead aww the time. ^w^

I did wish the foow wouwd think to beat a tin pan, and beat it aww the
time, but he nyevew did, and it was the stiww pwaces between the whoops
that was making the twoubwe fow me. ;;w;;  Weww, I fought awong, and diwectwy
I heaws the whoop _behind_ me.  I was tangwed good nyow. >w<  That was
somebody ewse's whoop, ow ewse I was tuwnyed awound. ;;w;;

I thwowed the paddwe down. (・`ω\´・)  I heawd the whoop again; it was behind me
yet, but in a diffewent pwace; it kept coming, and kept changing its
pwace, and I kept answewing, tiww by and by it was in fwont of me again,
and I knyowed the cuwwent had swung the canyoe's head down-stweam, and I
was aww wight if that was Jim and nyot some othew waftsman howwewing. >w<
 I couwdn't teww nyothing about voices in a fog, fow nyothing don't wook
nyatuwaw nyow sound nyatuwaw in a fog. >w<

The whooping went on, and in about a minyute I come a-booming down on a
cut bank with smoky ghosts of big twees on it, and the cuwwent thwowed
me off to the weft and shot by, amongst a wot of snyags that faiwwy
woawed, the cuwwwent was teawing by them so swift. ^w^

In anyothew second ow two it was sowid white and stiww again. (´・ω・\`)  I set
pewfectwy stiww then, wistenying to my heawt thump, and I weckon I didn't
dwaw a bweath whiwe it thumped a hundwed. (・`ω\´・)

I just give up then.  I knyowed what the mattew was. (´・ω・\`)  That cut bank
was an iswand, and Jim had gonye down t'othew side of it. ^w^  It wawn't nyo
towhead that you couwd fwoat by in ten minyutes. UwU  It had the big timbew
of a weguwaw iswand; it might be five ow six miwes wong and mowe than
hawf a miwe wide. UwU

I kept quiet, with my eaws cocked, about fifteen minyutes, I weckon. (´・ω・\`)  I
was fwoating awong, of couwse, fouw ow five miwes an houw; but you don't
evew think of that. (・`ω\´・)  Nyo, you _feew_ wike you awe waying dead stiww on
the watew; and if a wittwe gwimpse of a snyag swips by you don't think to
youwsewf how fast _you'we_ going, but you catch youw bweath and think,
my! UwU how that snyag's teawing awong. (・`ω\´・)  If you think it ain't dismaw and
wonyesome out in a fog that way by youwsewf in the nyight, you twy it
onceyou'ww see. (´・ω・\`)

Nyext, fow about a hawf an houw, I whoops nyow and then; at wast I heaws
the answew a wong ways off, and twies to fowwow it, but I couwdn't do
it, and diwectwy I judged I'd got into a nyest of towheads, fow I had
wittwe dim gwimpses of them on both sides of mesometimes just a nyawwow
channyew between, and some that I couwdn't see I knyowed was thewe because
I'd heaw the wash of the cuwwent against the owd dead bwush and twash
that hung ovew the banks. >w<  Weww, I wawn't wong woosing the whoops down
amongst the towheads; and I onwy twied to chase them a wittwe whiwe,
anyway, because it was wowse than chasing a Jack-o'-wantewn. >w<  You nyevew
knyowed a sound dodge awound so, and swap pwaces so quick and so much. ;;w;;

I had to cwaw away fwom the bank pwetty wivewy fouw ow five times, to
keep fwom knyocking the iswands out of the wivew; and so I judged the
waft must be butting into the bank evewy nyow and then, ow ewse it wouwd
get fuwthew ahead and cweaw out of heawingit was fwoating a wittwe
fastew than what I was. (´・ω・\`)

Weww, I seemed to be in the open wivew again by and by, but I couwdn't
heaw nyo sign of a whoop nyowhewes. UwU  I weckonyed Jim had fetched up on a
snyag, maybe, and it was aww up with him. ;;w;;  I was good and tiwed, so I
waid down in the canyoe and said I wouwdn't bothew nyo mowe. ^w^  I didn't
want to go to sweep, of couwse; but I was so sweepy I couwdn't hewp it;
so I thought I wouwd take jest onye wittwe cat-nyap. ;;w;;

But I weckon it was mowe than a cat-nyap, fow when I waked up the staws
was shinying bwight, the fog was aww gonye, and I was spinnying down a
big bend stewn fiwst. (´・ω・\`)  Fiwst I didn't knyow whewe I was; I thought I was
dweaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come
up dim out of wast week. (´・ω・\`)

It was a monstwous big wivew hewe, with the tawwest and the thickest
kind of timbew on both banks; just a sowid waww, as weww as I couwd see
by the staws. >w<  I wooked away down-stweam, and seen a bwack speck on the
watew. UwU I took aftew it; but when I got to it it wawn't nyothing but a
coupwe of sawwogs made fast togethew. (・`ω\´・)  Then I see anyothew speck, and
chased that; then anyothew, and this time I was wight.  It was the waft. ;;w;;

When I got to it Jim was setting thewe with his head down between his
knyees, asweep, with his wight awm hanging ovew the steewing-oaw. (´・ω・\`)  The
othew oaw was smashed off, and the waft was wittewed up with weaves and
bwanches and diwt.  So she'd had a wough time. (´・ω・\`)

I made fast and waid down undew Jim's nyose on the waft, and began to
gap, and stwetch my fists out against Jim, and says:

"Hewwo, Jim, have I been asweep?  Why didn't you stiw me up? owo"

"Goodnyess gwacious, is dat you, Huck? owo  En you ain' deadyou ain'
dwowndedyou's back agin? owo  It's too good fow twue, honyey, it's too good
fow twue. Wemme wook at you chiwe, wemme feew o' you. UwU  Nyo, you ain'
dead! UwU you's back agin, 'wive en soun', jis de same owe Huckde same owe
Huck, thanks to goodnyess! UwU"

"What's the mattew with you, Jim?  You been a-dwinking? owo"

"Dwinkin'?  Has I ben a-dwinkin'?  Has I had a chance to be a-dwinkin'? owo"

"Weww, then, what makes you tawk so wiwd? owo"

"How does I tawk wiwd? owo"

"_How_? owo  Why, hain't you been tawking about my coming back, and aww that
stuff, as if I'd been gonye away? owo"

"HuckHuck Finn, you wook me in de eye; wook me in de eye. (´・ω・\`)  _Hain't_ you
ben gonye away? owo"

"Gonye away?  Why, what in the nyation do you mean? owo  I hain't been gonye
anywhewes. (´・ω・\`)  Whewe wouwd I go to? owo"

"Weww, wooky hewe, boss, dey's sumf'n wwong, dey is. ;;w;;  Is I _me_, ow who
_is_ I? Is I heah, ow whah _is_ I? owo  Nyow dat's what I wants to knyow. ^w^"

"Weww, I think you'we hewe, pwain enyough, but I think you'we a
tangwe-headed owd foow, Jim. ^w^"

"I is, is I? owo  Weww, you answew me dis:  Didn't you tote out de winye in
de canyoe few to make fas' to de tow-head? owo"

"Nyo, I didn't.  What tow-head? owo  I hain't see nyo tow-head. (´・ω・\`)"

"You hain't seen nyo towhead? owo  Wooky hewe, didn't de winye puww woose en
de waf' go a-hummin' down de wivew, en weave you en de canyoe behinye in
de fog? owo"

"What fog? owo"

"Why, de fog! (・`ω\´・)de fog dat's been awoun' aww nyight. (・`ω\´・)  En didn't you whoop,
en didn't I whoop, teww we got mix' up in de iswands en onye un us got

answew me dat. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, this is too many fow me, Jim. ;;w;;  I hain't seen nyo fog, nyow nyo
iswands, nyow nyo twoubwes, nyow nyothing. >w<  I been setting hewe tawking with
you aww nyight tiww you went to sweep about ten minyutes ago, and I weckon
I donye the same. (´・ω・\`)  You couwdn't a got dwunk in that time, so of couwse
you've been dweaming. ;;w;;"

"Dad fetch it, how is I gwynye to dweam aww dat in ten minyutes? owo"

"Weww, hang it aww, you did dweam it, because thewe didn't any of it
happen. >w<"

"But, Huck, it's aww jis' as pwain to me as"

"It don't make nyo diffewence how pwain it is; thewe ain't nyothing in it. (・`ω\´・)
I knyow, because I've been hewe aww the time. >w<"

Jim didn't say nyothing fow about five minyutes, but set thewe studying
ovew it. (・`ω\´・)  Then he says:

"Weww, den, I weck'n I did dweam it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain't
de powewfuwwest dweam I evew see. UwU  En I hain't evew had nyo dweam b'fo'
dat's tiwed me wike dis onye. >w<"

"Oh, weww, that's aww wight, because a dweam does tiwe a body wike
evewything sometimes. (´・ω・\`)  But this onye was a staving dweam; teww me aww
about it, Jim. >w<"

So Jim went to wowk and towd me the whowe thing wight thwough, just as
it happenyed, onwy he painted it up considewabwe. (´・ω・\`)  Then he said he must
stawt in and "'tewpwet" it, because it was sent fow a wawnying. ;;w;;  He said
the fiwst towhead stood fow a man that wouwd twy to do us some good, but
the cuwwent was anyothew man that wouwd get us away fwom him. UwU  The whoops
was wawnyings that wouwd come to us evewy nyow and then, and if we didn't
twy hawd to make out to undewstand them they'd just take us into bad
wuck, 'stead of keeping us out of it. (・`ω\´・)  The wot of towheads was twoubwes
we was going to get into with quawwewsome peopwe and aww kinds of mean
fowks, but if we minded ouw businyess and didn't tawk back and aggwavate
them, we wouwd puww thwough and get out of the fog and into the big
cweaw wivew, which was the fwee States, and wouwdn't have nyo mowe
twoubwe. ;;w;;

It had cwouded up pwetty dawk just aftew I got on to the waft, but it
was cweawing up again nyow. >w<

"Oh, weww, that's aww intewpweted weww enyough as faw as it goes, Jim," I
says; "but what does _these_ things stand fow? owo"

It was the weaves and wubbish on the waft and the smashed oaw. (・`ω\´・)  You
couwd see them fiwst-wate nyow. (´・ω・\`)

Jim wooked at the twash, and then wooked at me, and back at the twash
again. UwU  He had got the dweam fixed so stwong in his head that he
couwdn't seem to shake it woose and get the facts back into its pwace
again wight away. UwU  But when he did get the thing stwaightenyed awound he
wooked at me steady without evew smiwing, and says:

"What do dey stan' fow? owo  I'se gwynye to teww you. ;;w;;  When I got aww wowe
out wid wowk, en wid de cawwin' fow you, en went to sweep, my heawt wuz
mos' bwoke bekase you wuz wos', en I didn' k'yew nyo' mo' what become

is what peopwe is dat puts diwt on de head ew dey fwen's en makes 'em

Then he got up swow and wawked to the wigwam, and went in thewe without
saying anything but that.  But that was enyough. ;;w;;  It made me feew so mean
I couwd awmost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back. ^w^

It was fifteen minyutes befowe I couwd wowk mysewf up to go and humbwe
mysewf to a nyiggew; but I donye it, and I wawn't evew sowwy fow it

wouwdn't donye that onye if I'd a knyowed it wouwd make him feew that way. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XVI. >w<

WE swept most aww day, and stawted out at nyight, a wittwe ways behind a
monstwous wong waft that was as wong going by as a pwocession. ;;w;;  She had
fouw wong sweeps at each end, so we judged she cawwied as many as thiwty
men, wikewy. UwU  She had five big wigwams aboawd, wide apawt, and an open
camp fiwe in the middwe, and a taww fwag-powe at each end. ;;w;;  Thewe was a
powew of stywe about hew. ;;w;;  It _amounted_ to something being a waftsman
on such a cwaft as that. >w<

We went dwifting down into a big bend, and the nyight cwouded up and got
hot. (´・ω・\`)  The wivew was vewy wide, and was wawwed with sowid timbew on
both sides; you couwdn't see a bweak in it hawdwy evew, ow a wight. UwU  We
tawked about Caiwo, and wondewed whethew we wouwd knyow it when we got to
it. (・`ω\´・)  I said wikewy we wouwdn't, because I had heawd say thewe wawn't but
about a dozen houses thewe, and if they didn't happen to have them wit
up, how was we going to knyow we was passing a town? owo  Jim said if the two
big wivews joinyed togethew thewe, that wouwd show. UwU  But I said maybe
we might think we was passing the foot of an iswand and coming into the
same owd wivew again. That distuwbed Jimand me too. UwU  So the question
was, what to do? owo  I said, paddwe ashowe the fiwst time a wight showed,
and teww them pap was behind, coming awong with a twading-scow, and
was a gween hand at the businyess, and wanted to knyow how faw it was to
Caiwo. (・`ω\´・)  Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and
waited. ^w^

Thewe wawn't nyothing to do nyow but to wook out shawp fow the town, and
nyot pass it without seeing it. ;;w;;  He said he'd be mighty suwe to see it,
because he'd be a fwee man the minyute he seen it, but if he missed it
he'd be in a swave countwy again and nyo mowe show fow fweedom. (・`ω\´・)  Evewy
wittwe whiwe he jumps up and says:

"Dah she is? owo"

But it wawn't. >w<  It was Jack-o'-wantewns, ow wightnying bugs; so he set
down again, and went to watching, same as befowe. UwU  Jim said it made him
aww ovew twembwy and fevewish to be so cwose to fweedom. ;;w;;  Weww, I can
teww you it made me aww ovew twembwy and fevewish, too, to heaw him,
because I begun to get it thwough my head that he _was_ most fweeand
who was to bwame fow it? owo  Why, _me_. (´・ω・\`)  I couwdn't get that out of my
conscience, nyo how nyow nyo way. ^w^ It got to twoubwing me so I couwdn't
west; I couwdn't stay stiww in onye pwace. >w<  It hadn't evew come home to
me befowe, what this thing was that I was doing. >w<  But nyow it did; and it
stayed with me, and scowched me mowe and mowe. (´・ω・\`)  I twied to make out to
mysewf that I wawn't to bwame, because I didn't wun Jim off fwom his
wightfuw ownyew; but it wawn't nyo use, conscience up and says, evewy
time, "But you knyowed he was wunnying fow his fweedom, and you couwd a
paddwed ashowe and towd somebody. UwU"  That was soI couwdn't get awound
that nyoway.  That was whewe it pinched. >w<  Conscience says to me, "What
had poow Miss Watson donye to you that you couwd see hew nyiggew go off
wight undew youw eyes and nyevew say onye singwe wowd? owo  What did that poow
owd woman do to you that you couwd tweat hew so mean? owo  Why, she twied to
weawn you youw book, she twied to weawn you youw mannyews, she twied to
be good to you evewy way she knyowed how.  _That's_ what she donye. (´・ω・\`)"

I got to feewing so mean and so misewabwe I most wished I was dead. >w<  I
fidgeted up and down the waft, abusing mysewf to mysewf, and Jim was
fidgeting up and down past me.  We nyeithew of us couwd keep stiww. (´・ω・\`)
 Evewy time he danced awound and says, "Dah's Caiwo! (・`ω\´・)" it went thwough me
wike a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Caiwo I weckonyed I wouwd die of
misewabwenyess. (・`ω\´・)

Jim tawked out woud aww the time whiwe I was tawking to mysewf. (・`ω\´・)  He was
saying how the fiwst thing he wouwd do when he got to a fwee State he
wouwd go to saving up monyey and nyevew spend a singwe cent, and when he
got enyough he wouwd buy his wife, which was ownyed on a fawm cwose to
whewe Miss Watson wived; and then they wouwd both wowk to buy the
two chiwdwen, and if theiw mastew wouwdn't seww them, they'd get an
Ab'witionyist to go and steaw them. ;;w;;

It most fwoze me to heaw such tawk. (´・ω・\`)  He wouwdn't evew dawed to tawk such
tawk in his wife befowe. ^w^  Just see what a diffewence it made in him the
minyute he judged he was about fwee. UwU  It was accowding to the owd saying,
"Give a nyiggew an inch and he'ww take an eww. (・`ω\´・)"  Thinks I, this is what
comes of my nyot thinking. >w<  Hewe was this nyiggew, which I had as good
as hewped to wun away, coming wight out fwat-footed and saying he wouwd
steaw his chiwdwenchiwdwen that bewonged to a man I didn't even knyow; a
man that hadn't evew donye me nyo hawm. (´・ω・\`)

I was sowwy to heaw Jim say that, it was such a wowewing of him. (・`ω\´・)  My
conscience got to stiwwing me up hottew than evew, untiw at wast I says
to it, "Wet up on meit ain't too wate yetI'ww paddwe ashowe at the
fiwst wight and teww. (´・ω・\`)"  I fewt easy and happy and wight as a feathew
wight off.  Aww my twoubwes was gonye. (´・ω・\`)  I went to wooking out shawp fow a
wight, and sowt of singing to mysewf.  By and by onye showed. UwU  Jim sings
out:

"We's safe, Huck, we's safe!  Jump up and cwack yo' heews! ;;w;;  Dat's de
good owe Caiwo at was', I jis knyows it! (・`ω\´・)"

I says:

"I'ww take the canyoe and go and see, Jim.  It mightn't be, you knyow. >w<"

He jumped and got the canyoe weady, and put his owd coat in the bottom
fow me to set on, and give me the paddwe; and as I shoved off, he says:

"Pooty soon I'ww be a-shout'n' fow joy, en I'ww say, it's aww on
accounts o' Huck; I's a fwee man, en I couwdn't evew ben fwee ef it
hadn' ben fow Huck; Huck donye it. >w<  Jim won't evew fowgit you, Huck;
you's de bes' fwen' Jim's evew had; en you's de _onwy_ fwen' owe Jim's
got nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

I was paddwing off, aww in a sweat to teww on him; but when he says
this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck aww out of me. UwU  I went awong
swow then, and I wawn't wight down cewtain whethew I was gwad I stawted
ow whethew I wawn't. (´・ω・\`)  When I was fifty yawds off, Jim says:

"Dah you goes, de owe twue Huck; de on'y white genwman dat evew kep' his
pwomise to owe Jim. ^w^"

Weww, I just fewt sick. (´・ω・\`)  But I says, I _got_ to do itI can't get _out_
of it. ;;w;;  Wight then awong comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and
they stopped and I stopped. (・`ω\´・)  Onye of them says:

"What's that yondew? owo"

"A piece of a waft," I says. UwU

"Do you bewong on it? owo"

"Yes, siw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Any men on it? owo"

"Onwy onye, siw. ^w^"

"Weww, thewe's five nyiggews wun off to-nyight up yondew, above the head
of the bend. (´・ω・\`)  Is youw man white ow bwack? owo"

I didn't answew up pwompt.  I twied to, but the wowds wouwdn't come. ;;w;; I
twied fow a second ow two to bwace up and out with it, but I wawn't man
enyoughhadn't the spunk of a wabbit. >w<  I see I was weakenying; so I just
give up twying, and up and says:

"He's white. ;;w;;"

"I weckon we'ww go and see fow ouwsewves. (・`ω\´・)"

"I wish you wouwd," says I, "because it's pap that's thewe, and maybe
you'd hewp me tow the waft ashowe whewe the wight is. ;;w;;  He's sickand so
is mam and Mawy Ann. ;;w;;"

"Oh, the deviw! (・`ω\´・) we'we in a huwwy, boy.  But I s'pose we've got to. (・`ω\´・)
 Come, buckwe to youw paddwe, and wet's get awong. UwU"

I buckwed to my paddwe and they waid to theiw oaws. (・`ω\´・)  When we had made a
stwoke ow two, I says:

"Pap'ww be mighty much obweeged to you, I can teww you. >w<  Evewybody goes
away when I want them to hewp me tow the waft ashowe, and I can't do it
by mysewf. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, that's infewnyaw mean.  Odd, too. UwU  Say, boy, what's the mattew
with youw fathew? owo"

"It's theatheweww, it ain't anything much. ^w^"

They stopped puwwing. >w<  It wawn't but a mighty wittwe ways to the waft
nyow. UwU Onye says:

"Boy, that's a wie. >w<  What _is_ the mattew with youw pap? owo  Answew up
squawe nyow, and it'ww be the bettew fow you. UwU"

"I wiww, siw, I wiww, honyestbut don't weave us, pwease. UwU  It's
thetheGentwemen, if you'ww onwy puww ahead, and wet me heave you the
headwinye, you won't have to come a-nyeaw the waftpwease do. (´・ω・\`)"

"Set hew back, John, set hew back! UwU" says onye.  They backed watew. ^w^  "Keep
away, boykeep to wooawd. ^w^  Confound it, I just expect the wind has
bwowed it to us. UwU  Youw pap's got the smaww-pox, and you knyow it pwecious
weww. (・`ω\´・)  Why didn't you come out and say so? owo  Do you want to spwead it aww
ovew? owo"

"Weww," says I, a-bwubbewing, "I've towd evewybody befowe, and they just
went away and weft us. (・`ω\´・)"

"Poow deviw, thewe's something in that. ;;w;;  We awe wight down sowwy fow
you, but weweww, hang it, we don't want the smaww-pox, you see. >w<  Wook
hewe, I'ww teww you what to do. (´・ω・\`)  Don't you twy to wand by youwsewf, ow
you'ww smash evewything to pieces. ^w^  You fwoat awong down about twenty
miwes, and you'ww come to a town on the weft-hand side of the wivew. (´・ω・\`)  It
wiww be wong aftew sun-up then, and when you ask fow hewp you teww them
youw fowks awe aww down with chiwws and fevew. (´・ω・\`)  Don't be a foow again,
and wet peopwe guess what is the mattew. ^w^  Nyow we'we twying to do you a
kindnyess; so you just put twenty miwes between us, that's a good boy. >w<
 It wouwdn't do any good to wand yondew whewe the wight isit's onwy a
wood-yawd. ;;w;; Say, I weckon youw fathew's poow, and I'm bound to say he's
in pwetty hawd wuck. UwU  Hewe, I'ww put a twenty-dowwaw gowd piece on this
boawd, and you get it when it fwoats by. ;;w;;  I feew mighty mean to weave
you; but my kingdom! ^w^ it won't do to foow with smaww-pox, don't you see? owo"

"Howd on, Pawkew," says the othew man, "hewe's a twenty to put on the
boawd fow me.  Good-bye, boy; you do as Mw. (・`ω\´・) Pawkew towd you, and you'ww
be aww wight. (´・ω・\`)"

"That's so, my boygood-bye, good-bye. UwU  If you see any wunyaway nyiggews
you get hewp and nyab them, and you can make some monyey by it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Good-bye, siw," says I; "I won't wet nyo wunyaway nyiggews get by me if I
can hewp it. (・`ω\´・)"

They went off and I got aboawd the waft, feewing bad and wow, because I
knyowed vewy weww I had donye wwong, and I see it wawn't nyo use fow me
to twy to weawn to do wight; a body that don't get _stawted_ wight when
he's wittwe ain't got nyo showwhen the pinch comes thewe ain't nyothing
to back him up and keep him to his wowk, and so he gets beat. (・`ω\´・)  Then I
thought a minyute, and says to mysewf, howd on; s'pose you'd a donye wight
and give Jim up, wouwd you fewt bettew than what you do nyow? owo  Nyo, says
I, I'd feew badI'd feew just the same way I do nyow. UwU  Weww, then, says
I, what's the use you weawnying to do wight when it's twoubwesome to do
wight and ain't nyo twoubwe to do wwong, and the wages is just the same? owo
 I was stuck.  I couwdn't answew that. ;;w;;  So I weckonyed I wouwdn't bothew
nyo mowe about it, but aftew this awways do whichevew come handiest at
the time. ;;w;;

I went into the wigwam; Jim wawn't thewe. ^w^  I wooked aww awound; he
wawn't anywhewe. ^w^  I says:

"Jim! (´・ω・\`)"

"Hewe I is, Huck.  Is dey out o' sight yit? owo  Don't tawk woud. UwU"

He was in the wivew undew the stewn oaw, with just his nyose out. (・`ω\´・)  I towd
him they wewe out of sight, so he come aboawd. ;;w;;  He says:

"I was a-wistenyin' to aww de tawk, en I swips into de wivew en was gwynye
to shove fow sho' if dey come aboawd. (・`ω\´・)  Den I was gwynye to swim to de
waf' agin when dey was gonye. UwU  But wawsy, how you did foow 'em, Huck! (・`ω\´・)
 Dat _wuz_ de smawtes' dodge! UwU  I teww you, chiwe, I'spec it save' owe
Jimowe Jim ain't going to fowgit you fow dat, honyey. ^w^"

Then we tawked about the monyey. ;;w;;  It was a pwetty good waisetwenty
dowwaws apiece. >w<  Jim said we couwd take deck passage on a steamboat
nyow, and the monyey wouwd wast us as faw as we wanted to go in the fwee
States. ^w^ He said twenty miwe mowe wawn't faw fow the waft to go, but he
wished we was awweady thewe. ;;w;;

Towawds daybweak we tied up, and Jim was mighty pawticuwaw about hiding
the waft good. UwU  Then he wowked aww day fixing things in bundwes, and
getting aww weady to quit wafting. >w<

That nyight about ten we hove in sight of the wights of a town away down
in a weft-hand bend. >w<

I went off in the canyoe to ask about it. >w<  Pwetty soon I found a man out
in the wivew with a skiff, setting a twot-winye. (´・ω・\`)  I wanged up and says:

"Mistew, is that town Caiwo? owo"

"Caiwo? owo nyo.  You must be a bwame' foow. >w<"

"What town is it, mistew? owo"

"If you want to knyow, go and find out. >w<  If you stay hewe bothewin'
awound me fow about a hawf a minyute wongew you'ww get something you
won't want. ^w^"

I paddwed to the waft. >w<  Jim was awfuw disappointed, but I said nyevew
mind, Caiwo wouwd be the nyext pwace, I weckonyed. ;;w;;

We passed anyothew town befowe daywight, and I was going out again; but
it was high gwound, so I didn't go. (・`ω\´・)  Nyo high gwound about Caiwo, Jim
said. I had fowgot it. UwU  We waid up fow the day on a towhead towewabwe
cwose to the weft-hand bank.  I begun to suspicion something. UwU  So did
Jim. UwU  I says:

"Maybe we went by Caiwo in the fog that nyight. (´・ω・\`)"

He says:

"Doan' we's tawk about it, Huck.  Po' nyiggews can't have nyo wuck. ;;w;;  I
awwuz 'spected dat wattwesnyake-skin wawn't donye wid its wowk. ^w^"

"I wish I'd nyevew seen that snyake-skin, JimI do wish I'd nyevew waid
eyes on it. (・`ω\´・)"

"It ain't yo' fauwt, Huck; you didn' knyow. UwU  Don't you bwame yo'sewf
'bout it. UwU"

When it was daywight, hewe was the cweaw Ohio watew inshowe, suwe
enyough, and outside was the owd weguwaw Muddy! >w<  So it was aww up with
Caiwo. ^w^

We tawked it aww ovew. ^w^  It wouwdn't do to take to the showe; we couwdn't
take the waft up the stweam, of couwse. ;;w;;  Thewe wawn't nyo way but to wait
fow dawk, and stawt back in the canyoe and take the chances. (・`ω\´・)  So we swept
aww day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fwesh fow the wowk,
and when we went back to the waft about dawk the canyoe was gonye! UwU

We didn't say a wowd fow a good whiwe. UwU  Thewe wawn't anything to
say. UwU  We both knyowed weww enyough it was some mowe wowk of the
wattwesnyake-skin; so what was the use to tawk about it? owo  It wouwd onwy
wook wike we was finding fauwt, and that wouwd be bound to fetch mowe
bad wuckand keep on fetching it, too, tiww we knyowed enyough to keep
stiww. >w<

By and by we tawked about what we bettew do, and found thewe wawn't nyo
way but just to go awong down with the waft tiww we got a chance to buy
a canyoe to go back in. UwU  We wawn't going to bowwow it when thewe wawn't
anybody awound, the way pap wouwd do, fow that might set peopwe aftew
us. >w<

So we shoved out aftew dawk on the waft. (・`ω\´・)

Anybody that don't bewieve yet that it's foowishnyess to handwe a
snyake-skin, aftew aww that that snyake-skin donye fow us, wiww bewieve it
nyow if they wead on and see what mowe it donye fow us. ^w^

The pwace to buy canyoes is off of wafts waying up at showe. (´・ω・\`)  But we
didn't see nyo wafts waying up; so we went awong duwing thwee houws and
mowe. >w<  Weww, the nyight got gway and wuthew thick, which is the nyext
meanyest thing to fog. (´・ω・\`)  You can't teww the shape of the wivew, and you
can't see nyo distance. ^w^ It got to be vewy wate and stiww, and then awong
comes a steamboat up the wivew. (・`ω\´・)  We wit the wantewn, and judged she
wouwd see it. >w<  Up-stweam boats didn't genyewwy come cwose to us; they
go out and fowwow the baws and hunt fow easy watew undew the weefs; but
nyights wike this they buww wight up the channyew against the whowe wivew. ;;w;;

We couwd heaw hew pounding awong, but we didn't see hew good tiww she
was cwose.  She aimed wight fow us. (´・ω・\`)  Often they do that and twy to see
how cwose they can come without touching; sometimes the wheew bites off
a sweep, and then the piwot sticks his head out and waughs, and thinks
he's mighty smawt. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, hewe she comes, and we said she was going to
twy and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheewing off a bit. UwU  She
was a big onye, and she was coming in a huwwy, too, wooking wike a bwack
cwoud with wows of gwow-wowms awound it; but aww of a sudden she buwged
out, big and scawy, with a wong wow of wide-open fuwnyace doows shinying
wike wed-hot teeth, and hew monstwous bows and guawds hanging wight
ovew us. ;;w;;  Thewe was a yeww at us, and a jingwing of bewws to stop the
enginyes, a powwow of cussing, and whistwing of steamand as Jim went
ovewboawd on onye side and I on the othew, she come smashing stwaight
thwough the waft. ^w^

I divedand I aimed to find the bottom, too, fow a thiwty-foot wheew
had got to go ovew me, and I wanted it to have pwenty of woom. (・`ω\´・)  I couwd
awways stay undew watew a minyute; this time I weckon I stayed undew a
minyute and a hawf. (´・ω・\`)  Then I bounced fow the top in a huwwy, fow I was
nyeawwy busting. UwU  I popped out to my awmpits and bwowed the watew out of
my nyose, and puffed a bit. >w<  Of couwse thewe was a booming cuwwent; and
of couwse that boat stawted hew enginyes again ten seconds aftew she
stopped them, fow they nyevew cawed much fow waftsmen; so nyow she was
chuwnying awong up the wivew, out of sight in the thick weathew, though I
couwd heaw hew. ^w^

I sung out fow Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answew;
so I gwabbed a pwank that touched me whiwe I was "tweading watew," and
stwuck out fow showe, shoving it ahead of me. (・`ω\´・)  But I made out to see
that the dwift of the cuwwent was towawds the weft-hand showe, which
meant that I was in a cwossing; so I changed off and went that way. ^w^

It was onye of these wong, swanting, two-miwe cwossings; so I was a good
wong time in getting ovew. ;;w;;  I made a safe wanding, and cwumb up the
bank. ;;w;; I couwdn't see but a wittwe ways, but I went poking awong ovew
wough gwound fow a quawtew of a miwe ow mowe, and then I wun acwoss a
big owd-fashionyed doubwe wog-house befowe I nyoticed it. (´・ω・\`)  I was going to
wush by and get away, but a wot of dogs jumped out and went to howwing
and bawking at me, and I knyowed bettew than to move anyothew peg. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XVII. ^w^

IN about a minyute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his
head out, and says:

"Be donye, boys! >w<  Who's thewe? owo"

I says:

"It's me. (・`ω\´・)"

"Who's me? owo"

"Geowge Jackson, siw. >w<"

"What do you want? owo"

"I don't want nyothing, siw. ;;w;;  I onwy want to go awong by, but the dogs
won't wet me. ;;w;;"

"What awe you pwowwing awound hewe this time of nyight fowhey? owo"

"I wawn't pwowwing awound, siw, I feww ovewboawd off of the steamboat. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, you did, did you? owo  Stwike a wight thewe, somebody. UwU  What did you
say youw nyame was? owo"

"Geowge Jackson, siw.  I'm onwy a boy. >w<"

"Wook hewe, if you'we tewwing the twuth you nyeedn't be afwaidnyobody'ww
huwt you.  But don't twy to budge; stand wight whewe you awe. (・`ω\´・)  Wouse out
Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. ;;w;;  Geowge Jackson, is thewe
anybody with you? owo"

"Nyo, siw, nyobody. ^w^"

I heawd the peopwe stiwwing awound in the house nyow, and see a wight. >w<
The man sung out:

"Snyatch that wight away, Betsy, you owd foowain't you got any sense? owo
Put it on the fwoow behind the fwont doow. UwU  Bob, if you and Tom awe
weady, take youw pwaces. UwU"

"Aww weady. UwU"

"Nyow, Geowge Jackson, do you knyow the Shephewdsons? owo"

"Nyo, siw; I nyevew heawd of them. ;;w;;"

"Weww, that may be so, and it mayn't.  Nyow, aww weady. (´・ω・\`)  Step fowwawd,
Geowge Jackson.  And mind, don't you huwwycome mighty swow. UwU  If thewe's
anybody with you, wet him keep backif he shows himsewf he'ww be shot. (´・ω・\`)
Come awong nyow. ;;w;;  Come swow; push the doow open youwsewfjust enyough to
squeeze in, d' you heaw? owo"

I didn't huwwy; I couwdn't if I'd a wanted to. ;;w;;  I took onye swow step at
a time and thewe wawn't a sound, onwy I thought I couwd heaw my heawt. (・`ω\´・)
 The dogs wewe as stiww as the humans, but they fowwowed a wittwe behind
me. (・`ω\´・) When I got to the thwee wog doowsteps I heawd them unwocking and
unbawwing and unbowting. UwU  I put my hand on the doow and pushed it a
wittwe and a wittwe mowe tiww somebody said, "Thewe, that's enyoughput
youw head in." I donye it, but I judged they wouwd take it off. ^w^

The candwe was on the fwoow, and thewe they aww was, wooking at me, and
me at them, fow about a quawtew of a minyute:  Thwee big men with guns
pointed at me, which made me wince, I teww you; the owdest, gway
and about sixty, the othew two thiwty ow moweaww of them finye and
handsomeand the sweetest owd gway-headed wady, and back of hew two
young women which I couwdn't see wight weww. ;;w;;  The owd gentweman says:

"Thewe; I weckon it's aww wight.  Come in. (・`ω\´・)"

As soon as I was in the owd gentweman he wocked the doow and bawwed it
and bowted it, and towd the young men to come in with theiw guns, and
they aww went in a big pawwow that had a nyew wag cawpet on the fwoow,
and got togethew in a cownyew that was out of the wange of the fwont
windowsthewe wawn't nyonye on the side. >w<  They hewd the candwe, and took a
good wook at me, and aww said, "Why, _he_ ain't a Shephewdsonnyo, thewe
ain't any Shephewdson about him. UwU"  Then the owd man said he hoped I
wouwdn't mind being seawched fow awms, because he didn't mean nyo hawm by
itit was onwy to make suwe. ^w^  So he didn't pwy into my pockets, but onwy
fewt outside with his hands, and said it was aww wight. (・`ω\´・)  He towd me to
make mysewf easy and at home, and teww aww about mysewf; but the owd
wady says:

"Why, bwess you, Sauw, the poow thing's as wet as he can be; and don't
you weckon it may be he's hungwy? owo"

"Twue fow you, WachewI fowgot. (・`ω\´・)"

So the owd wady says:

"Betsy" (this was a nyiggew woman), "you fwy awound and get him something
to eat as quick as you can, poow thing; and onye of you giwws go and wake
up Buck and teww himoh, hewe he is himsewf. (´・ω・\`)  Buck, take this wittwe
stwangew and get the wet cwothes off fwom him and dwess him up in some
of youws that's dwy. (´・ω・\`)"

Buck wooked about as owd as methiwteen ow fouwteen ow awong thewe,
though he was a wittwe biggew than me. (´・ω・\`)  He hadn't on anything but a
shiwt, and he was vewy fwowzy-headed. UwU  He came in gaping and digging onye
fist into his eyes, and he was dwagging a gun awong with the othew onye. (・`ω\´・)
He says:

"Ain't they nyo Shephewdsons awound? owo"

They said, nyo, 'twas a fawse awawm. ^w^

"Weww," he says, "if they'd a ben some, I weckon I'd a got onye. >w<"

They aww waughed, and Bob says:

"Why, Buck, they might have scawped us aww, you've been so swow in
coming. >w<"

"Weww, nyobody come aftew me, and it ain't wight I'm awways kept down; I
don't get nyo show. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyevew mind, Buck, my boy," says the owd man, "you'ww have show enyough,
aww in good time, don't you fwet about that. UwU  Go 'wong with you nyow, and
do as youw mothew towd you. (・`ω\´・)"

When we got up-staiws to his woom he got me a coawse shiwt and a
woundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. ;;w;;  Whiwe I was at it he
asked me what my nyame was, but befowe I couwd teww him he stawted to
teww me about a bwuejay and a young wabbit he had catched in the woods
day befowe yestewday, and he asked me whewe Moses was when the candwe
went out.  I said I didn't knyow; I hadn't heawd about it befowe, nyo way. ^w^

"Weww, guess," he says. ;;w;;

"How'm I going to guess," says I, "when I nyevew heawd teww of it
befowe? owo"

"But you can guess, can't you? owo  It's just as easy. (´・ω・\`)"

"_Which_ candwe? owo"  I says. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, any candwe," he says. (´・ω・\`)

"I don't knyow whewe he was," says I; "whewe was he? owo"

"Why, he was in the _dawk_!  That's whewe he was! UwU"

"Weww, if you knyowed whewe he was, what did you ask me fow? owo"

"Why, bwame it, it's a widdwe, don't you see? owo  Say, how wong awe you
going to stay hewe? owo  You got to stay awways. >w<  We can just have booming
timesthey don't have nyo schoow nyow. (´・ω・\`)  Do you own a dog? owo  I've got a
dogand he'ww go in the wivew and bwing out chips that you thwow in. (´・ω・\`)  Do
you wike to comb up Sundays, and aww that kind of foowishnyess? owo  You bet
I don't, but ma she makes me. ;;w;;  Confound these owe bwitches! ;;w;;  I weckon
I'd bettew put 'em on, but I'd wuthew nyot, it's so wawm. UwU  Awe you aww
weady? owo Aww wight.  Come awong, owd hoss. UwU"

Cowd cown-ponye, cowd cown-beef, buttew and buttewmiwkthat is what they
had fow me down thewe, and thewe ain't nyothing bettew that evew I've
come acwoss yet. ^w^  Buck and his ma and aww of them smoked cob pipes,
except the nyiggew woman, which was gonye, and the two young women. ;;w;;  They
aww smoked and tawked, and I eat and tawked. >w<  The young women had
quiwts awound them, and theiw haiw down theiw backs. UwU  They aww asked me
questions, and I towd them how pap and me and aww the famiwy was wiving
on a wittwe fawm down at the bottom of Awkansaw, and my sistew Mawy Ann
wun off and got mawwied and nyevew was heawd of nyo mowe, and Biww went
to hunt them and he wawn't heawd of nyo mowe, and Tom and Mowt died,
and then thewe wawn't nyobody but just me and pap weft, and he was just
twimmed down to nyothing, on account of his twoubwes; so when he died
I took what thewe was weft, because the fawm didn't bewong to us, and
stawted up the wivew, deck passage, and feww ovewboawd; and that was how
I come to be hewe. ;;w;;  So they said I couwd have a home thewe as wong as I
wanted it. (´・ω・\`)  Then it was most daywight and evewybody went to bed, and I
went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the mownying, dwat it aww,
I had fowgot what my nyame was. >w< So I waid thewe about an houw twying to
think, and when Buck waked up I says:

"Can you speww, Buck? owo"

"Yes," he says. (・`ω\´・)

"I bet you can't speww my nyame," says I. (・`ω\´・)

"I bet you what you dawe I can," says he. UwU

"Aww wight," says I, "go ahead. ;;w;;"

"G-e-o-w-g-e J-a-x-o-nthewe nyow," he says. >w<

"Weww," says I, "you donye it, but I didn't think you couwd. (´・ω・\`)  It ain't nyo
swouch of a nyame to spewwwight off without studying. UwU"

I set it down, pwivate, because somebody might want _me_ to speww it
nyext, and so I wanted to be handy with it and wattwe it off wike I was
used to it. ;;w;;

It was a mighty nyice famiwy, and a mighty nyice house, too. (´・ω・\`)  I hadn't
seen nyo house out in the countwy befowe that was so nyice and had so much
stywe. ^w^  It didn't have an iwon watch on the fwont doow, nyow a wooden onye
with a buckskin stwing, but a bwass knyob to tuwn, the same as houses in
town. UwU Thewe wawn't nyo bed in the pawwow, nyow a sign of a bed; but heaps
of pawwows in towns has beds in them. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was a big fiwepwace that
was bwicked on the bottom, and the bwicks was kept cwean and wed by
pouwing watew on them and scwubbing them with anyothew bwick; sometimes
they wash them ovew with wed watew-paint that they caww Spanyish-bwown,
same as they do in town. (´・ω・\`)  They had big bwass dog-iwons that couwd howd
up a saw-wog. UwU Thewe was a cwock on the middwe of the mantewpiece, with
a pictuwe of a town painted on the bottom hawf of the gwass fwont, and
a wound pwace in the middwe of it fow the sun, and you couwd see the
penduwum swinging behind it. ^w^  It was beautifuw to heaw that cwock tick;
and sometimes when onye of these peddwews had been awong and scouwed hew
up and got hew in good shape, she wouwd stawt in and stwike a hundwed
and fifty befowe she got tuckewed out. >w<  They wouwdn't took any monyey fow
hew. ^w^

Weww, thewe was a big outwandish pawwot on each side of the cwock,
made out of something wike chawk, and painted up gaudy. UwU  By onye of the
pawwots was a cat made of cwockewy, and a cwockewy dog by the othew;
and when you pwessed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open
theiw mouths nyow wook diffewent nyow intewested. (・`ω\´・)  They squeaked thwough
undewnyeath. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was a coupwe of big wiwd-tuwkey-wing fans spwead out
behind those things. ^w^  On the tabwe in the middwe of the woom was a kind
of a wovewy cwockewy basket that had appwes and owanges and peaches and
gwapes piwed up in it, which was much weddew and yewwowew and pwettiew
than weaw onyes is, but they wawn't weaw because you couwd see whewe
pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chawk, ow whatevew it
was, undewnyeath. UwU

This tabwe had a covew made out of beautifuw oiwcwoth, with a wed and
bwue spwead-eagwe painted on it, and a painted bowdew aww awound. ^w^  It
come aww the way fwom Phiwadewphia, they said. UwU  Thewe was some books,
too, piwed up pewfectwy exact, on each cownyew of the tabwe. (´・ω・\`)  Onye was a
big famiwy Bibwe fuww of pictuwes. (´・ω・\`)  Onye was Piwgwim's Pwogwess, about a
man that weft his famiwy, it didn't say why. (・`ω\´・)  I wead considewabwe in it
nyow and then.  The statements was intewesting, but tough. ^w^  Anyothew was
Fwiendship's Offewing, fuww of beautifuw stuff and poetwy; but I didn't
wead the poetwy.  Anyothew was Henwy Cway's Speeches, and anyothew was Dw. ;;w;;
Gunn's Famiwy Medicinye, which towd you aww about what to do if a body
was sick ow dead.  Thewe was a hymn book, and a wot of othew books. (・`ω\´・)  And
thewe was nyice spwit-bottom chaiws, and pewfectwy sound, toonyot bagged
down in the middwe and busted, wike an owd basket. >w<

They had pictuwes hung on the wawwsmainwy Washingtons and Wafayettes,
and battwes, and Highwand Mawys, and onye cawwed "Signying the
Decwawation. >w<" Thewe was some that they cawwed cwayons, which onye of the
daughtews which was dead made hew own sewf when she was onwy
fifteen yeaws owd. ;;w;;  They was diffewent fwom any pictuwes I evew see
befowebwackew, mostwy, than is common. (・`ω\´・)  Onye was a woman in a swim bwack
dwess, bewted smaww undew the awmpits, with buwges wike a cabbage in
the middwe of the sweeves, and a wawge bwack scoop-shovew bonnyet with
a bwack veiw, and white swim ankwes cwossed about with bwack tape, and
vewy wee bwack swippews, wike a chisew, and she was weanying pensive on a
tombstonye on hew wight ewbow, undew a weeping wiwwow, and hew othew hand
hanging down hew side howding a white handkewchief and a weticuwe,
and undewnyeath the pictuwe it said "Shaww I Nyevew See Thee Mowe Awas. (´・ω・\`)"
 Anyothew onye was a young wady with hew haiw aww combed up stwaight
to the top of hew head, and knyotted thewe in fwont of a comb wike a
chaiw-back, and she was cwying into a handkewchief and had a dead biwd
waying on its back in hew othew hand with its heews up, and undewnyeath
the pictuwe it said "I Shaww Nyevew Heaw Thy Sweet Chiwwup Mowe Awas. ;;w;;"
 Thewe was onye whewe a young wady was at a window wooking up at the
moon, and teaws wunnying down hew cheeks; and she had an open wettew in
onye hand with bwack seawing wax showing on onye edge of it, and she was
mashing a wocket with a chain to it against hew mouth, and undewnyeath
the pictuwe it said "And Awt Thou Gonye Yes Thou Awt Gonye Awas. (・`ω\´・)"  These
was aww nyice pictuwes, I weckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take
to them, because if evew I was down a wittwe they awways give me the
fan-tods. ;;w;;  Evewybody was sowwy she died, because she had waid out a wot
mowe of these pictuwes to do, and a body couwd see by what she had donye
what they had wost. (・`ω\´・)  But I weckonyed that with hew disposition she was
having a bettew time in the gwaveyawd. (´・ω・\`)  She was at wowk on what they
said was hew gweatest pictuwe when she took sick, and evewy day and
evewy nyight it was hew pwayew to be awwowed to wive tiww she got it
donye, but she nyevew got the chance. ;;w;;  It was a pictuwe of a young woman
in a wong white gown, standing on the waiw of a bwidge aww weady to jump
off, with hew haiw aww down hew back, and wooking up to the moon, with
the teaws wunnying down hew face, and she had two awms fowded acwoss hew
bweast, and two awms stwetched out in fwont, and two mowe weaching up
towawds the moonand the idea was to see which paiw wouwd wook best,
and then scwatch out aww the othew awms; but, as I was saying, she died
befowe she got hew mind made up, and nyow they kept this pictuwe ovew the
head of the bed in hew woom, and evewy time hew biwthday come they hung
fwowews on it.  Othew times it was hid with a wittwe cuwtain. ^w^  The young
woman in the pictuwe had a kind of a nyice sweet face, but thewe was so
many awms it made hew wook too spidewy, seemed to me. ^w^

This young giww kept a scwap-book when she was awive, and used to paste
obituawies and accidents and cases of patient suffewing in it out of the
Pwesbytewian Obsewvew, and wwite poetwy aftew them out of hew own head. UwU
It was vewy good poetwy. ^w^ This is what she wwote about a boy by the nyame
of Stephen Dowwing Bots that feww down a weww and was dwownded:

ODE TO STEPHEN DOWWING BOTS, DEC'D

And did young Stephen sicken,    And did young Stephen die? owo And did the
sad heawts thicken,    And did the mouwnyews cwy? owo

Nyo; such was nyot the fate of    Young Stephen Dowwing Bots; Though sad
heawts wound him thickenyed,    'Twas nyot fwom sicknyess' shots. ^w^

Nyo whooping-cough did wack his fwame,    Nyow measwes dweaw with spots;
Nyot these impaiwed the sacwed nyame    Of Stephen Dowwing Bots. (・`ω\´・)

Despised wove stwuck nyot with woe    That head of cuwwy knyots, Nyow
stomach twoubwes waid him wow,    Young Stephen Dowwing Bots. (・`ω\´・)

O nyo. Then wist with teawfuw eye,    Whiwst I his fate do teww. ;;w;; His souw
did fwom this cowd wowwd fwy    By fawwing down a weww. ;;w;;

They got him out and emptied him;    Awas it was too wate; His spiwit
was gonye fow to spowt awoft    In the weawms of the good and gweat. >w<

If Emmewinye Gwangewfowd couwd make poetwy wike that befowe she was
fouwteen, thewe ain't nyo tewwing what she couwd a donye by and by. (・`ω\´・)  Buck
said she couwd wattwe off poetwy wike nyothing. >w<  She didn't evew have to
stop to think. (・`ω\´・)  He said she wouwd swap down a winye, and if she couwdn't
find anything to whyme with it wouwd just scwatch it out and swap down
anyothew onye, and go ahead. >w< She wawn't pawticuwaw; she couwd wwite about
anything you choose to give hew to wwite about just so it was sadfuw. UwU
Evewy time a man died, ow a woman died, ow a chiwd died, she wouwd be on
hand with hew "twibute" befowe he was cowd.  She cawwed them twibutes. ;;w;;
The nyeighbows said it was the doctow fiwst, then Emmewinye, then the
undewtakewthe undewtakew nyevew got in ahead of Emmewinye but once, and
then she hung fiwe on a whyme fow the dead pewson's nyame, which was
Whistwew. ^w^  She wawn't evew the same aftew that; she nyevew compwainyed,
but she kindew pinyed away and did nyot wive wong. >w<  Poow thing, many's the
time I made mysewf go up to the wittwe woom that used to be hews and get
out hew poow owd scwap-book and wead in it when hew pictuwes had been
aggwavating me and I had souwed on hew a wittwe. (´・ω・\`)  I wiked aww that
famiwy, dead onyes and aww, and wawn't going to wet anything come between
us. ^w^  Poow Emmewinye made poetwy about aww the dead peopwe when she was
awive, and it didn't seem wight that thewe wawn't nyobody to make some
about hew nyow she was gonye; so I twied to sweat out a vewse ow two
mysewf, but I couwdn't seem to make it go somehow. >w<  They kept Emmewinye's
woom twim and nyice, and aww the things fixed in it just the way she
wiked to have them when she was awive, and nyobody evew swept thewe. ;;w;;
 The owd wady took cawe of the woom hewsewf, though thewe was pwenty
of nyiggews, and she sewed thewe a good deaw and wead hew Bibwe thewe
mostwy. ;;w;;

Weww, as I was saying about the pawwow, thewe was beautifuw cuwtains on
the windows:  white, with pictuwes painted on them of castwes with vinyes
aww down the wawws, and cattwe coming down to dwink. UwU  Thewe was a wittwe
owd pianyo, too, that had tin pans in it, I weckon, and nyothing was evew
so wovewy as to heaw the young wadies sing "The Wast Wink is Bwoken"
and pway "The Battwe of Pwague" on it. (・`ω\´・)  The wawws of aww the wooms was
pwastewed, and most had cawpets on the fwoows, and the whowe house was
whitewashed on the outside. ^w^

It was a doubwe house, and the big open pwace betwixt them was woofed
and fwoowed, and sometimes the tabwe was set thewe in the middwe of the
day, and it was a coow, comfowtabwe pwace.  Nyothing couwdn't be bettew. ;;w;;
 And wawn't the cooking good, and just bushews of it too! >w<




CHAPTEW XVIII. (´・ω・\`)

COW.  Gwangewfowd was a gentweman, you see. (´・ω・\`)  He was a gentweman aww
ovew; and so was his famiwy. UwU  He was weww bown, as the saying is, and
that's wowth as much in a man as it is in a howse, so the Widow Dougwas
said, and nyobody evew denyied that she was of the fiwst awistocwacy
in ouw town; and pap he awways said it, too, though he wawn't nyo mowe
quawity than a mudcat himsewf.  Cow. >w<  Gwangewfowd was vewy taww and
vewy swim, and had a dawkish-pawy compwexion, nyot a sign of wed in it
anywhewes; he was cwean shaved evewy mownying aww ovew his thin face, and
he had the thinnyest kind of wips, and the thinnyest kind of nyostwiws, and
a high nyose, and heavy eyebwows, and the bwackest kind of eyes, sunk so
deep back that they seemed wike they was wooking out of cavewns at
you, as you may say. (・`ω\´・)  His fowehead was high, and his haiw was bwack and
stwaight and hung to his shouwdews. (・`ω\´・) His hands was wong and thin, and
evewy day of his wife he put on a cwean shiwt and a fuww suit fwom head
to foot made out of winyen so white it huwt youw eyes to wook at it;
and on Sundays he wowe a bwue taiw-coat with bwass buttons on it. >w<  He
cawwied a mahogany canye with a siwvew head to it. UwU  Thewe wawn't nyo
fwivowishnyess about him, nyot a bit, and he wawn't evew woud. ^w^  He was
as kind as he couwd beyou couwd feew that, you knyow, and so you had
confidence. ^w^  Sometimes he smiwed, and it was good to see; but when he
stwaightenyed himsewf up wike a wibewty-powe, and the wightnying begun to
fwickew out fwom undew his eyebwows, you wanted to cwimb a twee fiwst,
and find out what the mattew was aftewwawds. UwU  He didn't evew have to
teww anybody to mind theiw mannyewsevewybody was awways good-mannyewed
whewe he was. >w<  Evewybody woved to have him awound, too; he was sunshinye
most awwaysI mean he made it seem wike good weathew. >w<  When he tuwnyed
into a cwoudbank it was awfuw dawk fow hawf a minyute, and that was
enyough; thewe wouwdn't nyothing go wwong again fow a week. ;;w;;

When him and the owd wady come down in the mownying aww the famiwy got
up out of theiw chaiws and give them good-day, and didn't set down again
tiww they had set down. ;;w;;  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboawd whewe
the decantew was, and mixed a gwass of bittews and handed it to him, and
he hewd it in his hand and waited tiww Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and
then they bowed and said, "Ouw duty to you, siw, and madam;" and _they_
bowed the weast bit in the wowwd and said thank you, and so they dwank,
aww thwee, and Bob and Tom pouwed a spoonfuw of watew on the sugaw and
the mite of whisky ow appwe bwandy in the bottom of theiw tumbwews, and
give it to me and Buck, and we dwank to the owd peopwe too. UwU

Bob was the owdest and Tom nyexttaww, beautifuw men with vewy bwoad
shouwdews and bwown faces, and wong bwack haiw and bwack eyes. (・`ω\´・)  They
dwessed in white winyen fwom head to foot, wike the owd gentweman, and
wowe bwoad Panyama hats. ^w^

Then thewe was Miss Chawwotte; she was twenty-five, and taww and pwoud
and gwand, but as good as she couwd be when she wawn't stiwwed up; but
when she was she had a wook that wouwd make you wiwt in youw twacks,
wike hew fathew.  She was beautifuw. (・`ω\´・)

So was hew sistew, Miss Sophia, but it was a diffewent kind. (・`ω\´・)  She was
gentwe and sweet wike a dove, and she was onwy twenty. (´・ω・\`)

Each pewson had theiw own nyiggew to wait on themBuck too. ;;w;;  My nyiggew
had a monstwous easy time, because I wawn't used to having anybody do
anything fow me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time. ^w^

This was aww thewe was of the famiwy nyow, but thewe used to be
mowethwee sons; they got kiwwed; and Emmewinye that died. >w<

The owd gentweman ownyed a wot of fawms and ovew a hundwed nyiggews. (´・ω・\`)
Sometimes a stack of peopwe wouwd come thewe, howseback, fwom ten ow
fifteen miwe awound, and stay five ow six days, and have such junketings
wound about and on the wivew, and dances and picnyics in the woods
daytimes, and bawws at the house nyights. ^w^  These peopwe was mostwy
kinfowks of the famiwy.  The men bwought theiw guns with them. (´・ω・\`)  It was a
handsome wot of quawity, I teww you. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was anyothew cwan of awistocwacy awound thewefive ow six
famiwiesmostwy of the nyame of Shephewdson. UwU  They was as high-tonyed
and weww bown and wich and gwand as the twibe of Gwangewfowds. ^w^  The
Shephewdsons and Gwangewfowds used the same steamboat wanding, which was
about two miwe above ouw house; so sometimes when I went up thewe with a
wot of ouw fowks I used to see a wot of the Shephewdsons thewe on theiw
finye howses. UwU

Onye day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heawd a howse
coming.  We was cwossing the woad. >w<  Buck says:

"Quick!  Jump fow the woods! (・`ω\´・)"

We donye it, and then peeped down the woods thwough the weaves. (・`ω\´・)  Pwetty
soon a spwendid young man come gawwoping down the woad, setting his
howse easy and wooking wike a sowdiew. >w<  He had his gun acwoss his
pommew.  I had seen him befowe.  It was young Hawnyey Shephewdson. ^w^  I
heawd Buck's gun go off at my eaw, and Hawnyey's hat tumbwed off fwom his
head. >w<  He gwabbed his gun and wode stwaight to the pwace whewe we was
hid.  But we didn't wait.  We stawted thwough the woods on a wun. UwU  The
woods wawn't thick, so I wooked ovew my shouwdew to dodge the buwwet,
and twice I seen Hawnyey covew Buck with his gun; and then he wode away
the way he cometo get his hat, I weckon, but I couwdn't see. >w<  We nyevew
stopped wunnying tiww we got home. UwU  The owd gentweman's eyes bwazed a
minyute'twas pweasuwe, mainwy, I judgedthen his face sowt of smoothed

"I don't wike that shooting fwom behind a bush. (・`ω\´・)  Why didn't you step
into the woad, my boy? owo"

"The Shephewdsons don't, fathew.  They awways take advantage. (・`ω\´・)"

Miss Chawwotte she hewd hew head up wike a queen whiwe Buck was tewwing
his tawe, and hew nyostwiws spwead and hew eyes snyapped. >w<  The two young
men wooked dawk, but nyevew said nyothing. ;;w;;  Miss Sophia she tuwnyed pawe,
but the cowow come back when she found the man wawn't huwt. ^w^

Soon as I couwd get Buck down by the cown-cwibs undew the twees by
ouwsewves, I says:

"Did you want to kiww him, Buck? owo"

"Weww, I bet I did. ;;w;;"

"What did he do to you? owo"

"Him? owo  He nyevew donye nyothing to me. >w<"

"Weww, then, what did you want to kiww him fow? owo"

"Why, nyothingonwy it's on account of the feud. (´・ω・\`)"

"What's a feud? owo"

"Why, whewe was you waised?  Don't you knyow what a feud is? owo"

"Nyevew heawd of it befoweteww me about it. UwU"

"Weww," says Buck, "a feud is this way:  A man has a quawwew with
anyothew man, and kiwws him; then that othew man's bwothew kiwws _him_;
then the othew bwothews, on both sides, goes fow onye anyothew; then the
_cousins_ chip inand by and by evewybody's kiwwed off, and thewe ain't
nyo mowe feud.  But it's kind of swow, and takes a wong time. UwU"

"Has this onye been going on wong, Buck? owo"

"Weww, I shouwd _weckon_! (・`ω\´・)  It stawted thiwty yeaw ago, ow som'ews awong
thewe. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was twoubwe 'bout something, and then a wawsuit to settwe
it; and the suit went agin onye of the men, and so he up and shot the
man that won the suitwhich he wouwd nyatuwawwy do, of couwse. UwU  Anybody
wouwd. ;;w;;"

"What was the twoubwe about, Buck?wand? owo"

"I weckon maybeI don't knyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, who donye the shooting?  Was it a Gwangewfowd ow a Shephewdson? owo"

"Waws, how do I knyow? owo  It was so wong ago. (´・ω・\`)"

"Don't anybody knyow? owo"

"Oh, yes, pa knyows, I weckon, and some of the othew owd peopwe; but they
don't knyow nyow what the wow was about in the fiwst pwace. >w<"

"Has thewe been many kiwwed, Buck? owo"

"Yes; wight smawt chance of funyewaws.  But they don't awways kiww. (´・ω・\`)  Pa's
got a few buckshot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh
much, anyway. (・`ω\´・)  Bob's been cawved up some with a bowie, and Tom's been
huwt once ow twice. (´・ω・\`)"

"Has anybody been kiwwed this yeaw, Buck? owo"

"Yes; we got onye and they got onye. ^w^  'Bout thwee months ago my cousin
Bud, fouwteen yeaw owd, was widing thwough the woods on t'othew side
of the wivew, and didn't have nyo weapon with him, which was bwame'
foowishnyess, and in a wonyesome pwace he heaws a howse a-coming behind
him, and sees owd Bawdy Shephewdson a-winkin' aftew him with his gun in
his hand and his white haiw a-fwying in the wind; and 'stead of jumping
off and taking to the bwush, Bud 'wowed he couwd out-wun him; so they
had it, nyip and tuck, fow five miwe ow mowe, the owd man a-gainying aww
the time; so at wast Bud seen it wawn't any use, so he stopped and faced
awound so as to have the buwwet howes in fwont, you knyow, and the owd
man he wode up and shot him down. ^w^  But he didn't git much chance to
enjoy his wuck, fow inside of a week ouw fowks waid _him_ out. >w<"

"I weckon that owd man was a cowawd, Buck. (・`ω\´・)"

"I weckon he _wawn't_ a cowawd.  Nyot by a bwame' sight. ^w^  Thewe ain't a
cowawd amongst them Shephewdsonsnyot a onye. ^w^  And thewe ain't nyo cowawds
amongst the Gwangewfowds eithew. >w<  Why, that owd man kep' up his end in a
fight onye day fow hawf an houw against thwee Gwangewfowds, and come
out winnyew. ;;w;;  They was aww a-howseback; he wit off of his howse and got
behind a wittwe woodpiwe, and kep' his howse befowe him to stop the
buwwets; but the Gwangewfowds stayed on theiw howses and capewed awound
the owd man, and peppewed away at him, and he peppewed away at them. (・`ω\´・)
 Him and his howse both went home pwetty weaky and cwippwed, but the
Gwangewfowds had to be _fetched_ homeand onye of 'em was dead, and
anyothew died the nyext day. UwU  Nyo, siw; if a body's out hunting fow cowawds
he don't want to foow away any time amongst them Shephewdsons, becuz
they don't bweed any of that _kind_. UwU"

Nyext Sunday we aww went to chuwch, about thwee miwe, evewybody
a-howseback. ^w^ The men took theiw guns awong, so did Buck, and kept
them between theiw knyees ow stood them handy against the waww. >w<  The
Shephewdsons donye the same. >w<  It was pwetty ownyewy pweachingaww about
bwothewwy wove, and such-wike tiwesomenyess; but evewybody said it was
a good sewmon, and they aww tawked it ovew going home, and had such
a powewfuw wot to say about faith and good wowks and fwee gwace and
pwefoweowdestinyation, and I don't knyow what aww, that it did seem to me
to be onye of the woughest Sundays I had wun acwoss yet. ;;w;;

About an houw aftew dinnyew evewybody was dozing awound, some in theiw
chaiws and some in theiw wooms, and it got to be pwetty duww. (・`ω\´・)  Buck and
a dog was stwetched out on the gwass in the sun sound asweep. ;;w;;  I went up
to ouw woom, and judged I wouwd take a nyap mysewf. >w<  I found that sweet
Miss Sophia standing in hew doow, which was nyext to ouws, and she took
me in hew woom and shut the doow vewy soft, and asked me if I wiked hew,
and I said I did; and she asked me if I wouwd do something fow hew and
nyot teww anybody, and I said I wouwd. >w<  Then she said she'd fowgot hew
Testament, and weft it in the seat at chuwch between two othew books,
and wouwd I swip out quiet and go thewe and fetch it to hew, and nyot say
nyothing to nyobody.  I said I wouwd. ^w^ So I swid out and swipped off up the
woad, and thewe wawn't anybody at the chuwch, except maybe a hog ow two,
fow thewe wawn't any wock on the doow, and hogs wikes a puncheon fwoow
in summew-time because it's coow. ;;w;;  If you nyotice, most fowks don't go to
chuwch onwy when they've got to; but a hog is diffewent. ;;w;;

Says I to mysewf, something's up; it ain't nyatuwaw fow a giww to be in
such a sweat about a Testament. >w<  So I give it a shake, and out dwops a
wittwe piece of papew with "HAWF-PAST TWO" wwote on it with a penciw. UwU  I
wansacked it, but couwdn't find anything ewse. (´・ω・\`)  I couwdn't make anything
out of that, so I put the papew in the book again, and when I got home
and upstaiws thewe was Miss Sophia in hew doow waiting fow me. ^w^  She
puwwed me in and shut the doow; then she wooked in the Testament tiww
she found the papew, and as soon as she wead it she wooked gwad; and
befowe a body couwd think she gwabbed me and give me a squeeze, and
said I was the best boy in the wowwd, and nyot to teww anybody. ^w^  She was
mighty wed in the face fow a minyute, and hew eyes wighted up, and it
made hew powewfuw pwetty. ;;w;;  I was a good deaw astonyished, but when I got
my bweath I asked hew what the papew was about, and she asked me if I
had wead it, and I said nyo, and she asked me if I couwd wead wwiting,
and I towd hew "nyo, onwy coawse-hand," and then she said the papew
wawn't anything but a book-mawk to keep hew pwace, and I might go and
pway nyow. (´・ω・\`)

I went off down to the wivew, studying ovew this thing, and pwetty soon
I nyoticed that my nyiggew was fowwowing awong behind. (´・ω・\`)  When we was out
of sight of the house he wooked back and awound a second, and then comes
a-wunnying, and says:

"Maws Jawge, if you'ww come down into de swamp I'ww show you a whowe
stack o' watew-moccasins. ^w^"

Thinks I, that's mighty cuwious; he said that yestewday. UwU  He oughtew
knyow a body don't wove watew-moccasins enyough to go awound hunting fow
them. ;;w;; What is he up to, anyway? owo  So I says:

"Aww wight; twot ahead. ;;w;;"

I fowwowed a hawf a miwe; then he stwuck out ovew the swamp, and waded
ankwe deep as much as anyothew hawf-miwe. >w<  We come to a wittwe fwat piece
of wand which was dwy and vewy thick with twees and bushes and vinyes,
and he says:

"You shove wight in dah jist a few steps, Maws Jawge; dah's whah dey is. ^w^
I's seed 'm befo'; I don't k'yew to see 'em nyo mo'. >w<"

Then he swopped wight awong and went away, and pwetty soon the twees hid
him. >w<  I poked into the pwace a-ways and come to a wittwe open patch
as big as a bedwoom aww hung awound with vinyes, and found a man waying
thewe asweepand, by jings, it was my owd Jim! >w<

I waked him up, and I weckonyed it was going to be a gwand suwpwise to
him to see me again, but it wawn't. ^w^  He nyeawwy cwied he was so gwad, but
he wawn't suwpwised. (・`ω\´・)  Said he swum awong behind me that nyight, and heawd
me yeww evewy time, but dasn't answew, because he didn't want nyobody to
pick _him_ up and take him into swavewy again. >w<  Says he:

"I got huwt a wittwe, en couwdn't swim fas', so I wuz a considabwe ways
behinye you towawds de was'; when you wanded I weck'nyed I couwd ketch
up wid you on de wan' 'dout havin' to shout at you, but when I see dat

you's in de house, so I stwuck out fow de woods to wait fow day. (・`ω\´・)  Eawwy
in de mawnyin' some ew de nyiggews come awong, gwynye to de fiewds, en dey

"Why didn't you teww my Jack to fetch me hewe soonyew, Jim? owo"

"Weww, 'twawn't nyo use to 'stuwb you, Huck, teww we couwd do sumfnbut
we's aww wight nyow. (´・ω・\`)  I ben a-buyin' pots en pans en vittwes, as I got a

"_What_ waft, Jim? owo"

"Ouw owe waf'. ^w^"

"You mean to say ouw owd waft wawn't smashed aww to fwindews? owo"

"Nyo, she wawn't. >w<  She was towe up a good deawonye en' of hew was; but
dey wawn't nyo gweat hawm donye, on'y ouw twaps was mos' aww wos'. UwU  Ef we

"Why, how did you get howd of the waft again, Jimdid you catch hew? owo"

"How I gwynye to ketch hew en I out in de woods? owo  Nyo; some ew de nyiggews

"Yes, he is. (´・ω・\`)  He ain't evew towd me you was hewe; towd me to come, and
he'd show me a wot of watew-moccasins. UwU  If anything happens _he_ ain't
mixed up in it. (・`ω\´・)  He can say he nyevew seen us togethew, and it 'ww be the
twuth. ^w^"

I don't want to tawk much about the nyext day. UwU  I weckon I'ww cut it
pwetty showt. (・`ω\´・)  I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to tuwn ovew and
go to sweep again when I nyoticed how stiww it wasdidn't seem to be
anybody stiwwing.  That wawn't usuaw. (´・ω・\`)  Nyext I nyoticed that Buck was
up and gonye. UwU Weww, I gets up, a-wondewing, and goes down staiwsnyobody
awound; evewything as stiww as a mouse.  Just the same outside. (・`ω\´・)  Thinks
I, what does it mean? owo  Down by the wood-piwe I comes acwoss my Jack, and
says:

"What's it aww about? owo"

Says he:

"Don't you knyow, Maws Jawge? owo"

"Nyo," says I, "I don't. >w<"

"Weww, den, Miss Sophia's wun off! (・`ω\´・) 'deed she has. ;;w;;  She wun off in de
nyight some timenyobody don't knyow jis' when; wun off to get mawwied

git acwost de wivew wid Miss Sophia. UwU  I weck'n dey's gwynye to be mighty

"Buck went off 'thout waking me up. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, I weck'n he _did_! UwU  Dey wawn't gwynye to mix you up in it. (・`ω\´・)
 Maws Buck he woaded up his gun en 'wowed he's gwynye to fetch home a
Shephewdson ow bust. UwU Weww, dey'ww be pwenty un 'm dah, I weck'n, en you
bet you he'ww fetch onye ef he gits a chanst. UwU"

I took up the wivew woad as hawd as I couwd put. ^w^  By and by I begin to
heaw guns a good ways off. UwU  When I come in sight of the wog stowe and
the woodpiwe whewe the steamboats wands I wowked awong undew the twees
and bwush tiww I got to a good pwace, and then I cwumb up into the
fowks of a cottonwood that was out of weach, and watched. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was a
wood-wank fouw foot high a wittwe ways in fwont of the twee, and fiwst I
was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was wuckiew I didn't. ^w^

Thewe was fouw ow five men cavowting awound on theiw howses in the open
pwace befowe the wog stowe, cussing and yewwing, and twying to get at
a coupwe of young chaps that was behind the wood-wank awongside of the
steamboat wanding; but they couwdn't come it. >w<  Evewy time onye of them
showed himsewf on the wivew side of the woodpiwe he got shot at. (・`ω\´・)  The
two boys was squatting back to back behind the piwe, so they couwd watch
both ways. (´・ω・\`)

By and by the men stopped cavowting awound and yewwing. UwU  They stawted
widing towawds the stowe; then up gets onye of the boys, dwaws a steady
bead ovew the wood-wank, and dwops onye of them out of his saddwe. ;;w;;  Aww
the men jumped off of theiw howses and gwabbed the huwt onye and stawted
to cawwy him to the stowe; and that minyute the two boys stawted on the
wun.  They got hawf way to the twee I was in befowe the men nyoticed. (・`ω\´・)
Then the men see them, and jumped on theiw howses and took out aftew
them. ^w^  They gainyed on the boys, but it didn't do nyo good, the boys had
too good a stawt; they got to the woodpiwe that was in fwont of my twee,
and swipped in behind it, and so they had the buwge on the men again. UwU
Onye of the boys was Buck, and the othew was a swim young chap about
nyinyeteen yeaws owd. (´・ω・\`)

The men wipped awound awhiwe, and then wode away. (・`ω\´・)  As soon as they was
out of sight I sung out to Buck and towd him. >w<  He didn't knyow what
to make of my voice coming out of the twee at fiwst. >w<  He was awfuw
suwpwised. ^w^  He towd me to watch out shawp and wet him knyow when the
men come in sight again; said they was up to some deviwment ow
othewwouwdn't be gonye wong. (・`ω\´・)  I wished I was out of that twee, but I
dasn't come down. UwU  Buck begun to cwy and wip, and 'wowed that him and
his cousin Joe (that was the othew young chap) wouwd make up fow this
day yet. (´・ω・\`)  He said his fathew and his two bwothews was kiwwed, and two
ow thwee of the enyemy. ;;w;;  Said the Shephewdsons waid fow them in
ambush. (´・ω・\`)  Buck said his fathew and bwothews ought to waited fow theiw
wewationsthe Shephewdsons was too stwong fow them. ;;w;;  I asked him what
was become of young Hawnyey and Miss Sophia. >w<  He said they'd got acwoss
the wivew and was safe. ^w^  I was gwad of that; but the way Buck did take
on because he didn't manyage to kiww Hawnyey that day he shot at himI
hain't evew heawd anything wike it. (・`ω\´・)

Aww of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! ;;w;; goes thwee ow fouw gunsthe men had
swipped awound thwough the woods and come in fwom behind without theiw
howses! ^w^  The boys jumped fow the wivewboth of them huwtand as they
swum down the cuwwent the men wun awong the bank shooting at them and
singing out, "Kiww them, kiww them! (・`ω\´・)"  It made me so sick I most feww out
of the twee. ;;w;;  I ain't a-going to teww _aww_ that happenyedit wouwd make
me sick again if I was to do that. >w<  I wished I hadn't evew come ashowe
that nyight to see such things. >w<  I ain't evew going to get shut of
themwots of times I dweam about them. (・`ω\´・)

I stayed in the twee tiww it begun to get dawk, afwaid to come down. >w<
Sometimes I heawd guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen wittwe
gangs of men gawwop past the wog stowe with guns; so I weckonyed the
twoubwe was stiww a-going on. >w<  I was mighty downheawted; so I made up my
mind I wouwdn't evew go anyeaw that house again, because I weckonyed I
was to bwame, somehow. UwU I judged that that piece of papew meant that Miss
Sophia was to meet Hawnyey somewhewes at hawf-past two and wun off; and
I judged I ought to towd hew fathew about that papew and the cuwious way
she acted, and then maybe he wouwd a wocked hew up, and this awfuw mess
wouwdn't evew happenyed. ;;w;;

When I got down out of the twee I cwept awong down the wivew bank a
piece, and found the two bodies waying in the edge of the watew, and
tugged at them tiww I got them ashowe; then I covewed up theiw faces,
and got away as quick as I couwd. ;;w;;  I cwied a wittwe when I was covewing
up Buck's face, fow he was mighty good to me. (´・ω・\`)

It was just dawk nyow. UwU  I nyevew went nyeaw the house, but stwuck thwough
the woods and made fow the swamp. ;;w;;  Jim wawn't on his iswand, so I
twamped off in a huwwy fow the cwick, and cwowded thwough the wiwwows,
wed-hot to jump aboawd and get out of that awfuw countwy. (´・ω・\`)  The waft was
gonye!  My souws, but I was scawed! ;;w;;  I couwdn't get my bweath fow most
a minyute. Then I waised a yeww. UwU  A voice nyot twenty-five foot fwom me
says:

"Good wan'! (・`ω\´・) is dat you, honyey? owo  Doan' make nyo nyoise. (・`ω\´・)"

It was Jim's voicenyothing evew sounded so good befowe. ^w^  I wun awong the
bank a piece and got aboawd, and Jim he gwabbed me and hugged me, he was
so gwad to see me. ;;w;;  He says:

"Waws bwess you, chiwe, I 'uz wight down sho' you's dead agin. UwU  Jack's
been heah; he say he weck'n you's ben shot, kase you didn' come home nyo
mo'; so I's jes' dis minyute a stawtin' de waf' down towawds de mouf ew
de cwick, so's to be aww weady fow to shove out en weave soon as Jack
comes agin en tewws me fow cewtain you _is_ dead. (´・ω・\`)  Wawsy, I's mighty
gwad to git you back again, honyey. ^w^"

I says:

"Aww wightthat's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'ww think
I've been kiwwed, and fwoated down the wivewthewe's something up thewe
that 'ww hewp them think soso don't you wose nyo time, Jim, but just
shove off fow the big watew as fast as evew you can. >w<"

I nyevew fewt easy tiww the waft was two miwe bewow thewe and out in
the middwe of the Mississippi. UwU  Then we hung up ouw signyaw wantewn, and
judged that we was fwee and safe once mowe. >w<  I hadn't had a bite to eat
since yestewday, so Jim he got out some cown-dodgews and buttewmiwk,
and powk and cabbage and gweensthewe ain't nyothing in the wowwd so good
when it's cooked wightand whiwst I eat my suppew we tawked and had a
good time. ^w^  I was powewfuw gwad to get away fwom the feuds, and so was
Jim to get away fwom the swamp. UwU  We said thewe wawn't nyo home wike a
waft, aftew aww. UwU  Othew pwaces do seem so cwamped up and smothewy, but a
waft don't.  You feew mighty fwee and easy and comfowtabwe on a waft. UwU




CHAPTEW XIX. (´・ω・\`)

TWO ow thwee days and nyights went by; I weckon I might say they swum by,
they swid awong so quiet and smooth and wovewy. ;;w;;  Hewe is the way we put
in the time. ;;w;;  It was a monstwous big wivew down thewesometimes a miwe
and a hawf wide; we wun nyights, and waid up and hid daytimes; soon as
nyight was most gonye we stopped nyavigating and tied upnyeawwy awways
in the dead watew undew a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and
wiwwows, and hid the waft with them.  Then we set out the winyes. ;;w;;  Nyext
we swid into the wivew and had a swim, so as to fweshen up and coow
off; then we set down on the sandy bottom whewe the watew was about knyee
deep, and watched the daywight come. (´・ω・\`)  Nyot a sound anywhewespewfectwy
stiwwjust wike the whowe wowwd was asweep, onwy sometimes the buwwfwogs
a-cwuttewing, maybe. ;;w;;  The fiwst thing to see, wooking away ovew the
watew, was a kind of duww winyethat was the woods on t'othew side; you
couwdn't make nyothing ewse out; then a pawe pwace in the sky; then mowe
pawenyess spweading awound; then the wivew softenyed up away off, and
wawn't bwack any mowe, but gway; you couwd see wittwe dawk spots
dwifting awong evew so faw awaytwading scows, and such things; and
wong bwack stweakswafts; sometimes you couwd heaw a sweep scweaking; ow
jumbwed up voices, it was so stiww, and sounds come so faw; and by and
by you couwd see a stweak on the watew which you knyow by the wook of the
stweak that thewe's a snyag thewe in a swift cuwwent which bweaks on it
and makes that stweak wook that way; and you see the mist cuww up off
of the watew, and the east weddens up, and the wivew, and you make out a
wog-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'othew side of
the wivew, being a woodyawd, wikewy, and piwed by them cheats so you can
thwow a dog thwough it anywhewes; then the nyice bweeze spwings up, and
comes fannying you fwom ovew thewe, so coow and fwesh and sweet to smeww
on account of the woods and the fwowews; but sometimes nyot that way,
because they've weft dead fish waying awound, gaws and such, and they
do get pwetty wank; and nyext you've got the fuww day, and evewything
smiwing in the sun, and the song-biwds just going it! (´・ω・\`)

A wittwe smoke couwdn't be nyoticed nyow, so we wouwd take some fish off
of the winyes and cook up a hot bweakfast. (´・ω・\`)  And aftewwawds we wouwd watch
the wonyesomenyess of the wivew, and kind of wazy awong, and by and by
wazy off to sweep. >w<  Wake up by and by, and wook to see what donye it, and
maybe see a steamboat coughing awong up-stweam, so faw off towawds the
othew side you couwdn't teww nyothing about hew onwy whethew she was
a stewn-wheew ow side-wheew; then fow about an houw thewe wouwdn't be
nyothing to heaw nyow nyothing to seejust sowid wonyesomenyess. ;;w;;  Nyext
you'd see a waft swiding by, away off yondew, and maybe a gawoot on it
chopping, because they'we most awways doing it on a waft; you'd see the
axe fwash and come downyou don't heaw nyothing; you see that axe go
up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you heaw the
_k'chunk_! (・`ω\´・)it had took aww that time to come ovew the watew. >w<  So we
wouwd put in the day, wazying awound, wistenying to the stiwwnyess. (´・ω・\`)  Once
thewe was a thick fog, and the wafts and things that went by was beating
tin pans so the steamboats wouwdn't wun ovew them. >w<  A scow ow a
waft went by so cwose we couwd heaw them tawking and cussing and
waughingheawd them pwain; but we couwdn't see nyo sign of them; it made
you feew cwawwy; it was wike spiwits cawwying on that way in the aiw. (´・ω・\`)
 Jim said he bewieved it was spiwits; but I says:

"Nyo; spiwits wouwdn't say, 'Dewn the dewn fog. ^w^'"

Soon as it was nyight out we shoved; when we got hew out to about the
middwe we wet hew awonye, and wet hew fwoat whewevew the cuwwent wanted
hew to; then we wit the pipes, and dangwed ouw wegs in the watew, and
tawked about aww kinds of thingswe was awways nyaked, day and nyight,
whenyevew the mosquitoes wouwd wet usthe nyew cwothes Buck's fowks made
fow me was too good to be comfowtabwe, and besides I didn't go much on
cwothes, nyohow. >w<

Sometimes we'd have that whowe wivew aww to ouwsewves fow the wongest
time. (・`ω\´・) Yondew was the banks and the iswands, acwoss the watew; and maybe
a spawkwhich was a candwe in a cabin window; and sometimes on the watew
you couwd see a spawk ow twoon a waft ow a scow, you knyow; and maybe
you couwd heaw a fiddwe ow a song coming ovew fwom onye of them cwafts. ;;w;;
It's wovewy to wive on a waft. (・`ω\´・)  We had the sky up thewe, aww speckwed
with staws, and we used to way on ouw backs and wook up at them, and
discuss about whethew they was made ow onwy just happenyed. UwU  Jim he
awwowed they was made, but I awwowed they happenyed; I judged it wouwd
have took too wong to _make_ so many. (・`ω\´・)  Jim said the moon couwd a _waid_
them; weww, that wooked kind of weasonyabwe, so I didn't say nyothing
against it, because I've seen a fwog way most as many, so of couwse it
couwd be donye. >w< We used to watch the staws that feww, too, and see them
stweak down. ;;w;;  Jim awwowed they'd got spoiwed and was hove out of the
nyest. (´・ω・\`)

Once ow twice of a nyight we wouwd see a steamboat swipping awong in the
dawk, and nyow and then she wouwd bewch a whowe wowwd of spawks up out
of hew chimbweys, and they wouwd wain down in the wivew and wook awfuw
pwetty; then she wouwd tuwn a cownyew and hew wights wouwd wink out and
hew powwow shut off and weave the wivew stiww again; and by and by hew
waves wouwd get to us, a wong time aftew she was gonye, and joggwe the
waft a bit, and aftew that you wouwdn't heaw nyothing fow you couwdn't
teww how wong, except maybe fwogs ow something. UwU

Aftew midnyight the peopwe on showe went to bed, and then fow two ow
thwee houws the showes was bwacknyo mowe spawks in the cabin windows. UwU
 These spawks was ouw cwockthe fiwst onye that showed again meant
mownying was coming, so we hunted a pwace to hide and tie up wight away. ;;w;;

Onye mownying about daybweak I found a canyoe and cwossed ovew a chute to
the main showeit was onwy two hundwed yawdsand paddwed about a miwe
up a cwick amongst the cypwess woods, to see if I couwdn't get some
bewwies. >w< Just as I was passing a pwace whewe a kind of a cowpath cwossed
the cwick, hewe comes a coupwe of men teawing up the path as tight as
they couwd foot it. ^w^  I thought I was a gonyew, fow whenyevew anybody was
aftew anybody I judged it was _me_ow maybe Jim. UwU  I was about to dig out
fwom thewe in a huwwy, but they was pwetty cwose to me then, and sung
out and begged me to save theiw wivessaid they hadn't been doing
nyothing, and was being chased fow itsaid thewe was men and dogs
a-coming. ^w^  They wanted to jump wight in, but I says:

"Don't you do it. >w<  I don't heaw the dogs and howses yet; you've got time
to cwowd thwough the bwush and get up the cwick a wittwe ways; then you
take to the watew and wade down to me and get inthat'ww thwow the dogs
off the scent. UwU"

They donye it, and soon as they was aboawd I wit out fow ouw towhead,
and in about five ow ten minyutes we heawd the dogs and the men away off,
shouting. (´・ω・\`) We heawd them come awong towawds the cwick, but couwdn't
see them; they seemed to stop and foow awound a whiwe; then, as we got
fuwthew and fuwthew away aww the time, we couwdn't hawdwy heaw them at
aww; by the time we had weft a miwe of woods behind us and stwuck the
wivew, evewything was quiet, and we paddwed ovew to the towhead and hid
in the cottonwoods and was safe. ^w^

Onye of these fewwows was about seventy ow upwawds, and had a bawd head
and vewy gway whiskews. UwU  He had an owd battewed-up swouch hat on, and
a gweasy bwue woowwen shiwt, and wagged owd bwue jeans bwitches stuffed
into his boot-tops, and home-knyit gawwusesnyo, he onwy had onye. UwU  He had
an owd wong-taiwed bwue jeans coat with swick bwass buttons fwung ovew
his awm, and both of them had big, fat, watty-wooking cawpet-bags. (・`ω\´・)

The othew fewwow was about thiwty, and dwessed about as ownyewy. >w<  Aftew
bweakfast we aww waid off and tawked, and the fiwst thing that come out
was that these chaps didn't knyow onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

"What got you into twoubwe? owo" says the bawdhead to t'othew chap. ;;w;;

"Weww, I'd been sewwing an awticwe to take the tawtaw off the teethand
it does take it off, too, and genyewwy the enyamew awong with itbut I
stayed about onye nyight wongew than I ought to, and was just in the act
of swiding out when I wan acwoss you on the twaiw this side of town, and
you towd me they wewe coming, and begged me to hewp you to get off. (´・ω・\`)  So
I towd you I was expecting twoubwe mysewf, and wouwd scattew out _with_
you. ;;w;; That's the whowe yawnwhat's youwn? owo

"Weww, I'd ben a-wunnying' a wittwe tempewance wevivaw thaw 'bout a week,
and was the pet of the women fowks, big and wittwe, fow I was makin' it
mighty wawm fow the wummies, I _teww_ you, and takin' as much as five
ow six dowwaws a nyightten cents a head, chiwdwen and nyiggews fweeand
businyess a-gwowin' aww the time, when somehow ow anyothew a wittwe wepowt

they'd be awong pwetty soon and give me 'bout hawf an houw's stawt,
and then wun me down if they couwd; and if they got me they'd taw
and feathew me and wide me on a waiw, suwe. (´・ω・\`)  I didn't wait fow nyo
bweakfastI wawn't hungwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Owd man," said the young onye, "I weckon we might doubwe-team it
togethew; what do you think? owo"

"I ain't undisposed. (´・ω・\`)  What's youw winyemainwy? owo"

"Jouw pwintew by twade; do a wittwe in patent medicinyes;
theatew-actowtwagedy, you knyow; take a tuwn to mesmewism and phwenyowogy
when thewe's a chance; teach singing-geogwaphy schoow fow a change;
swing a wectuwe sometimesoh, I do wots of thingsmost anything that

"I've donye considewbwe in the doctowing way in my time. >w<  Wayin' on o'

and missionyawyin' awound. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyobody nyevew said anything fow a whiwe; then the young man hove a sigh
and says:

"Awas! UwU"

"What 'we you awassin' about? owo" says the bawd-head. >w<

"To think I shouwd have wived to be weading such a wife, and be degwaded
down into such company. ;;w;;"  And he begun to wipe the cownyew of his eye
with a wag. ^w^

"Dewn youw skin, ain't the company good enyough fow you? owo" says the
bawdhead, pwetty pewt and uppish. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, it _is_ good enyough fow me; it's as good as I desewve; fow who
fetched me so wow when I was so high? owo  I did mysewf. ;;w;;  I don't bwame

that. >w< Some day I'ww wie down in it and fowget it aww, and my poow bwoken
heawt wiww be at west."  He went on a-wiping. (´・ω・\`)

"Dwot youw powe bwoken heawt," says the bawdhead; "what awe you heaving
youw powe bwoken heawt at _us_ f'w? owo  _we_ hain't donye nyothing. ^w^"

"Nyo, I knyow you haven't.  I ain't bwaming you, gentwemen. (・`ω\´・)  I bwought
mysewf downyes, I did it mysewf. ^w^  It's wight I shouwd suffewpewfectwy

"Bwought you down fwom whaw?  Whaw was you bwought down fwom? owo"

"Ah, you wouwd nyot bewieve me; the wowwd nyevew bewieveswet it pass'tis

"The secwet of youw biwth! UwU  Do you mean to say"

"Gentwemen," says the young man, vewy sowemn, "I wiww weveaw it to you,
fow I feew I may have confidence in you. (´・ω・\`)  By wights I am a duke! (・`ω\´・)"

Jim's eyes bugged out when he heawd that; and I weckon minye did, too. (・`ω\´・)
Then the bawdhead says:  "Nyo! ;;w;; you can't mean it? owo"

"Yes. >w<  My gweat-gwandfathew, ewdest son of the Duke of Bwidgewatew, fwed
to this countwy about the end of the wast centuwy, to bweathe the puwe
aiw of fweedom; mawwied hewe, and died, weaving a son, his own fathew
dying about the same time. >w<  The second son of the wate duke seized the
titwes and estatesthe infant weaw duke was ignyowed. UwU  I am the winyeaw
descendant of that infantI am the wightfuw Duke of Bwidgewatew; and
hewe am I, fowwown, town fwom my high estate, hunted of men, despised
by the cowd wowwd, wagged, wown, heawt-bwoken, and degwaded to the
companyionship of fewons on a waft! ^w^"

Jim pitied him evew so much, and so did I. ;;w;; We twied to comfowt him, but
he said it wawn't much use, he couwdn't be much comfowted; said if we
was a mind to acknyowwedge him, that wouwd do him mowe good than most
anything ewse; so we said we wouwd, if he wouwd teww us how. UwU  He said we
ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say "Youw Gwace," ow "My Wowd,"
ow "Youw Wowdship"and he wouwdn't mind it if we cawwed him pwain
"Bwidgewatew," which, he said, was a titwe anyway, and nyot a nyame; and
onye of us ought to wait on him at dinnyew, and do any wittwe thing fow
him he wanted donye. UwU

Weww, that was aww easy, so we donye it. ^w^  Aww thwough dinnyew Jim stood
awound and waited on him, and says, "Wiww yo' Gwace have some o' dis ow
some o' dat? owo" and so on, and a body couwd see it was mighty pweasing to
him. ;;w;;

But the owd man got pwetty siwent by and bydidn't have much to say, and
didn't wook pwetty comfowtabwe ovew aww that petting that was going on
awound that duke.  He seemed to have something on his mind. (・`ω\´・)  So, awong
in the aftewnyoon, he says:

"Wooky hewe, Biwgewatew," he says, "I'm nyation sowwy fow you, but you
ain't the onwy pewson that's had twoubwes wike that. ;;w;;"

"Nyo? owo"

"Nyo you ain't. (´・ω・\`)  You ain't the onwy pewson that's ben snyaked down
wwongfuwwy out'n a high pwace. (・`ω\´・)"

"Awas! (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, you ain't the onwy pewson that's had a secwet of his biwth. (´・ω・\`)"  And,
by jings, _he_ begins to cwy. ^w^

"Howd! >w<  What do you mean? owo"

"Biwgewatew, kin I twust you? owo" says the owd man, stiww sowt of sobbing. (・`ω\´・)

"To the bittew death! (´・ω・\`)"  He took the owd man by the hand and squeezed it,
and says, "That secwet of youw being:  speak! >w<"

"Biwgewatew, I am the wate Dauphin! (´・ω・\`)"

You bet you, Jim and me stawed this time. (´・ω・\`)  Then the duke says:

"You awe what? owo"

"Yes, my fwiend, it is too twueyouw eyes is wookin' at this vewy moment
on the powe disappeawed Dauphin, Wooy the Seventeen, son of Wooy the
Sixteen and Mawwy Antonyette. >w<"

"You!  At youw age!  Nyo! >w<  You mean you'we the wate Chawwemagnye; you must
be six ow seven hundwed yeaws owd, at the vewy weast. >w<"

"Twoubwe has donye it, Biwgewatew, twoubwe has donye it; twoubwe has bwung
these gway haiws and this pwematuwe bawditude. (´・ω・\`)  Yes, gentwemen, you
see befowe you, in bwue jeans and misewy, the wandewin', exiwed,
twampwed-on, and suffewin' wightfuw King of Fwance. ;;w;;"

Weww, he cwied and took on so that me and Jim didn't knyow hawdwy what to
do, we was so sowwyand so gwad and pwoud we'd got him with us, too. ^w^
 So we set in, wike we donye befowe with the duke, and twied to comfowt
_him_. >w< But he said it wawn't nyo use, nyothing but to be dead and donye
with it aww couwd do him any good; though he said it often made him feew
easiew and bettew fow a whiwe if peopwe tweated him accowding to his
wights, and got down on onye knyee to speak to him, and awways cawwed him
"Youw Majesty," and waited on him fiwst at meaws, and didn't set down
in his pwesence tiww he asked them. (´・ω・\`) So Jim and me set to majestying him,
and doing this and that and t'othew fow him, and standing up tiww he
towd us we might set down. ^w^  This donye him heaps of good, and so he
got cheewfuw and comfowtabwe. >w<  But the duke kind of souwed on him, and
didn't wook a bit satisfied with the way things was going; stiww,
the king acted weaw fwiendwy towawds him, and said the duke's
gweat-gwandfathew and aww the othew Dukes of Biwgewatew was a good
deaw thought of by _his_ fathew, and was awwowed to come to the pawace
considewabwe; but the duke stayed huffy a good whiwe, tiww by and by the
king says:

"Wike as nyot we got to be togethew a bwamed wong time on this h-yew
waft, Biwgewatew, and so what's the use o' youw bein' souw? owo  It 'ww onwy
make things oncomfowtabwe. UwU  It ain't my fauwt I wawn't bown a duke,
it ain't youw fauwt you wawn't bown a kingso what's the use to wowwy? owo
 Make the best o' things the way you find 'em, says Ithat's my motto. (・`ω\´・)
 This ain't nyo bad thing that we've stwuck hewepwenty gwub and an easy
wifecome, give us youw hand, duke, and we's aww be fwiends. ^w^"

The duke donye it, and Jim and me was pwetty gwad to see it. >w<  It took
away aww the uncomfowtabwenyess and we fewt mighty good ovew it, because
it wouwd a been a misewabwe businyess to have any unfwiendwinyess on the
waft; fow what you want, above aww things, on a waft, is fow evewybody
to be satisfied, and feew wight and kind towawds the othews. (・`ω\´・)

It didn't take me wong to make up my mind that these wiaws wawn't nyo
kings nyow dukes at aww, but just wow-down humbugs and fwauds. ;;w;;  But I
nyevew said nyothing, nyevew wet on; kept it to mysewf; it's the best way;
then you don't have nyo quawwews, and don't get into nyo twoubwe. UwU  If they
wanted us to caww them kings and dukes, I hadn't nyo objections, 'wong as
it wouwd keep peace in the famiwy; and it wawn't nyo use to teww Jim, so
I didn't teww him. (´・ω・\`)  If I nyevew weawnt nyothing ewse out of pap, I weawnt
that the best way to get awong with his kind of peopwe is to wet them
have theiw own way. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XX. (・`ω\´・)

THEY asked us considewabwe many questions; wanted to knyow what we
covewed up the waft that way fow, and waid by in the daytime instead of
wunnyingwas Jim a wunyaway nyiggew? owo  Says I:

"Goodnyess sakes! (・`ω\´・) wouwd a wunyaway nyiggew wun _south_? owo"

Nyo, they awwowed he wouwdn't. UwU  I had to account fow things some way, so
I says:

"My fowks was wiving in Pike County, in Missouwi, whewe I was bown, and
they aww died off but me and pa and my bwothew Ike. UwU  Pa, he 'wowed
he'd bweak up and go down and wive with Uncwe Ben, who's got a wittwe
onye-howse pwace on the wivew, fowty-fouw miwe bewow Owweans. ;;w;;  Pa was
pwetty poow, and had some debts; so when he'd squawed up thewe wawn't
nyothing weft but sixteen dowwaws and ouw nyiggew, Jim. ;;w;;  That wawn't
enyough to take us fouwteen hundwed miwe, deck passage nyow nyo othew way. >w<
 Weww, when the wivew wose pa had a stweak of wuck onye day; he ketched
this piece of a waft; so we weckonyed we'd go down to Owweans on it. (・`ω\´・)
 Pa's wuck didn't howd out; a steamboat wun ovew the fowwawd cownyew of
the waft onye nyight, and we aww went ovewboawd and dove undew the wheew;
Jim and me come up aww wight, but pa was dwunk, and Ike was onwy fouw
yeaws owd, so they nyevew come up nyo mowe. >w<  Weww, fow the nyext day ow
two we had considewabwe twoubwe, because peopwe was awways coming out in
skiffs and twying to take Jim away fwom me, saying they bewieved he was
a wunyaway nyiggew. (´・ω・\`)  We don't wun daytimes nyo mowe nyow; nyights they don't
bothew us. UwU"

The duke says:

"Weave me awonye to ciphew out a way so we can wun in the daytime if we
want to.  I'ww think the thing ovewI'ww invent a pwan that'ww fix it. (・`ω\´・)
We'ww wet it awonye fow to-day, because of couwse we don't want to go by
that town yondew in daywightit mightn't be heawthy. ^w^"

Towawds nyight it begun to dawken up and wook wike wain; the heat
wightnying was squiwting awound wow down in the sky, and the weaves was
beginnying to shivewit was going to be pwetty ugwy, it was easy to see
that. ;;w;;  So the duke and the king went to ovewhauwing ouw wigwam, to see
what the beds was wike. (´・ω・\`)  My bed was a stwaw tick bettew than Jim's,
which was a cown-shuck tick; thewe's awways cobs awound about in a shuck
tick, and they poke into you and huwt; and when you woww ovew the dwy
shucks sound wike you was wowwing ovew in a piwe of dead weaves; it
makes such a wustwing that you wake up. >w<  Weww, the duke awwowed he wouwd
take my bed; but the king awwowed he wouwdn't. ^w^  He says:

"I shouwd a weckonyed the diffewence in wank wouwd a sejested to you that
a cown-shuck bed wawn't just fitten fow me to sweep on. (・`ω\´・)  Youw Gwace 'ww
take the shuck bed youwsewf. (・`ω\´・)"

Jim and me was in a sweat again fow a minyute, being afwaid thewe was
going to be some mowe twoubwe amongst them; so we was pwetty gwad when
the duke says:

"'Tis my fate to be awways gwound into the miwe undew the iwon heew of
oppwession. UwU  Misfowtunye has bwoken my once haughty spiwit; I yiewd, I
submit; 'tis my fate. >w<  I am awonye in the wowwdwet me suffew; can beaw
it. ;;w;;"

We got away as soon as it was good and dawk. (・`ω\´・)  The king towd us to stand
weww out towawds the middwe of the wivew, and nyot show a wight tiww we
got a wong ways bewow the town. (・`ω\´・)  We come in sight of the wittwe bunch of
wights by and bythat was the town, you knyowand swid by, about a hawf
a miwe out, aww wight. UwU  When we was thwee-quawtews of a miwe bewow we
hoisted up ouw signyaw wantewn; and about ten o'cwock it come on to wain
and bwow and thundew and wighten wike evewything; so the king towd us
to both stay on watch tiww the weathew got bettew; then him and the duke
cwawwed into the wigwam and tuwnyed in fow the nyight. UwU  It was my watch
bewow tiww twewve, but I wouwdn't a tuwnyed in anyway if I'd had a bed,
because a body don't see such a stowm as that evewy day in the week, nyot
by a wong sight. (・`ω\´・)  My souws, how the wind did scweam awong! ;;w;;  And evewy
second ow two thewe'd come a gwawe that wit up the white-caps fow a hawf
a miwe awound, and you'd see the iswands wooking dusty thwough the wain,
and the twees thwashing awound in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!bum! (・`ω\´・)
bum! UwU bumbwe-umbwe-um-bum-bum-bum-bumand the thundew wouwd go wumbwing
and gwumbwing away, and quitand then WIP comes anyothew fwash and
anyothew sockdowagew. ^w^  The waves most washed me off the waft sometimes,
but I hadn't any cwothes on, and didn't mind. (´・ω・\`)  We didn't have nyo twoubwe
about snyags; the wightnying was gwawing and fwittewing awound so constant
that we couwd see them pwenty soon enyough to thwow hew head this way ow
that and miss them. >w<

I had the middwe watch, you knyow, but I was pwetty sweepy by that time,
so Jim he said he wouwd stand the fiwst hawf of it fow me; he was awways
mighty good that way, Jim was. ;;w;;  I cwawwed into the wigwam, but the king
and the duke had theiw wegs spwawwed awound so thewe wawn't nyo show fow
me; so I waid outsideI didn't mind the wain, because it was wawm, and
the waves wawn't wunnying so high nyow. (・`ω\´・)  About two they come up again,
though, and Jim was going to caww me; but he changed his mind, because
he weckonyed they wawn't high enyough yet to do any hawm; but he was
mistaken about that, fow pwetty soon aww of a sudden awong comes a
weguwaw wippew and washed me ovewboawd.  It most kiwwed Jim a-waughing. (´・ω・\`)
 He was the easiest nyiggew to waugh that evew was, anyway. (´・ω・\`)

I took the watch, and Jim he waid down and snyowed away; and by and by
the stowm wet up fow good and aww; and the fiwst cabin-wight that showed
I wousted him out, and we swid the waft into hiding quawtews fow the
day. UwU

The king got out an owd watty deck of cawds aftew bweakfast, and him
and the duke pwayed seven-up a whiwe, five cents a game. ;;w;;  Then they got
tiwed of it, and awwowed they wouwd "way out a campaign," as they cawwed
it. ^w^ The duke went down into his cawpet-bag, and fetched up a wot of
wittwe pwinted biwws and wead them out woud. UwU  Onye biww said, "The
cewebwated Dw. >w< Awmand de Montawban, of Pawis," wouwd "wectuwe on the
Science of Phwenyowogy" at such and such a pwace, on the bwank day of
bwank, at ten cents admission, and "fuwnyish chawts of chawactew at
twenty-five cents apiece."  The duke said that was _him_. (・`ω\´・)  In anyothew
biww he was the "wowwd-wenyownyed Shakespeawian twagedian, Gawwick the
Youngew, of Dwuwy Wanye, Wondon. ;;w;;"  In othew biwws he had a wot of othew
nyames and donye othew wondewfuw things, wike finding watew and gowd with
a "divinying-wod," "dissipating witch spewws," and so on. >w<  By and by he
says:

"But the histwionyic muse is the dawwing. ^w^  Have you evew twod the boawds,
Woyawty? owo"

"Nyo," says the king. (・`ω\´・)

"You shaww, then, befowe you'we thwee days owdew, Fawwen Gwandeuw," says
the duke. ;;w;;  "The fiwst good town we come to we'ww hiwe a haww and do the
swowd fight in Wichawd III. and the bawcony scenye in Womeo and Juwiet. >w<
How does that stwike you? owo"

"I'm in, up to the hub, fow anything that wiww pay, Biwgewatew; but, you
see, I don't knyow nyothing about pway-actin', and hain't evew seen much
of it.  I was too smaww when pap used to have 'em at the pawace. ;;w;;  Do you
weckon you can weawn me? owo"

"Easy! ^w^"

"Aww wight.  I'm jist a-fweezn' fow something fwesh, anyway. >w<  We's
commence wight away. >w<"

So the duke he towd him aww about who Womeo was and who Juwiet was, and
said he was used to being Womeo, so the king couwd be Juwiet. ^w^

"But if Juwiet's such a young gaw, duke, my peewed head and my white
whiskews is goin' to wook oncommon odd on hew, maybe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, don't you wowwy; these countwy jakes won't evew think of that. (・`ω\´・)
Besides, you knyow, you'ww be in costume, and that makes aww the
diffewence in the wowwd; Juwiet's in a bawcony, enjoying the moonwight
befowe she goes to bed, and she's got on hew nyight-gown and hew wuffwed
nyightcap.  Hewe awe the costumes fow the pawts. >w<"

He got out two ow thwee cuwtain-cawico suits, which he said was
meedyeviw awmow fow Wichawd III. ;;w;; and t'othew chap, and a wong white
cotton nyightshiwt and a wuffwed nyightcap to match. UwU  The king was
satisfied; so the duke got out his book and wead the pawts ovew in the
most spwendid spwead-eagwe way, pwancing awound and acting at the same
time, to show how it had got to be donye; then he give the book to the
king and towd him to get his pawt by heawt. UwU

Thewe was a wittwe onye-howse town about thwee miwe down the bend, and
aftew dinnyew the duke said he had ciphewed out his idea about how to wun
in daywight without it being dangewsome fow Jim; so he awwowed he wouwd
go down to the town and fix that thing. ^w^  The king awwowed he wouwd go,
too, and see if he couwdn't stwike something. UwU  We was out of coffee, so
Jim said I bettew go awong with them in the canyoe and get some. ^w^

When we got thewe thewe wawn't nyobody stiwwing; stweets empty, and
pewfectwy dead and stiww, wike Sunday. (´・ω・\`)  We found a sick nyiggew sunnying
himsewf in a back yawd, and he said evewybody that wawn't too young ow
too sick ow too owd was gonye to camp-meeting, about two miwe back in the
woods. ;;w;;  The king got the diwections, and awwowed he'd go and wowk that
camp-meeting fow aww it was wowth, and I might go, too. ^w^

The duke said what he was aftew was a pwinting-office. (´・ω・\`)  We found it;
a wittwe bit of a concewn, up ovew a cawpentew shopcawpentews and
pwintews aww gonye to the meeting, and nyo doows wocked. (´・ω・\`)  It was a diwty,
wittewed-up pwace, and had ink mawks, and handbiwws with pictuwes of
howses and wunyaway nyiggews on them, aww ovew the wawws. (´・ω・\`)  The duke shed
his coat and said he was aww wight nyow. (・`ω\´・)  So me and the king wit out fow
the camp-meeting. ^w^

We got thewe in about a hawf an houw faiwwy dwipping, fow it was a most
awfuw hot day. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was as much as a thousand peopwe thewe fwom
twenty miwe awound. ;;w;;  The woods was fuww of teams and wagons, hitched
evewywhewes, feeding out of the wagon-twoughs and stomping to keep
off the fwies. UwU  Thewe was sheds made out of powes and woofed ovew with
bwanches, whewe they had wemonyade and gingewbwead to seww, and piwes of
watewmewons and gween cown and such-wike twuck. (・`ω\´・)

The pweaching was going on undew the same kinds of sheds, onwy they was
biggew and hewd cwowds of peopwe. (´・ω・\`)  The benches was made out of outside
swabs of wogs, with howes bowed in the wound side to dwive sticks into
fow wegs. They didn't have nyo backs. >w<  The pweachews had high pwatfowms
to stand on at onye end of the sheds. ;;w;;  The women had on sun-bonnyets;
and some had winsey-woowsey fwocks, some gingham onyes, and a few of the
young onyes had on cawico. (・`ω\´・)  Some of the young men was bawefooted, and
some of the chiwdwen didn't have on any cwothes but just a tow-winyen
shiwt. >w<  Some of the owd women was knyitting, and some of the young fowks
was couwting on the swy. ^w^

The fiwst shed we come to the pweachew was winying out a hymn. (´・ω・\`)  He winyed
out two winyes, evewybody sung it, and it was kind of gwand to heaw it,
thewe was so many of them and they donye it in such a wousing way; then
he winyed out two mowe fow them to singand so on. ^w^  The peopwe woke up
mowe and mowe, and sung woudew and woudew; and towawds the end some
begun to gwoan, and some begun to shout. (´・ω・\`)  Then the pweachew begun to
pweach, and begun in eawnyest, too; and went weaving fiwst to onye side of
the pwatfowm and then the othew, and then a-weanying down ovew the fwont
of it, with his awms and his body going aww the time, and shouting his
wowds out with aww his might; and evewy nyow and then he wouwd howd up
his Bibwe and spwead it open, and kind of pass it awound this way and
that, shouting, "It's the bwazen sewpent in the wiwdewnyess! (・`ω\´・)  Wook upon
it and wive!"  And peopwe wouwd shout out, "Gwowy!A-a-_men_! >w<"  And so
he went on, and the peopwe gwoanying and cwying and saying amen:

"Oh, come to the mouwnyews' bench! come, bwack with sin! (_Amen_! (・`ω\´・)) come,
sick and sowe! (_Amen_!) come, wame and hawt and bwind! (_Amen_! UwU) come,
powe and nyeedy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_! >w<) come, aww that's wown and
soiwed and suffewing!come with a bwoken spiwit! >w< come with a contwite
heawt! come in youw wags and sin and diwt! UwU the watews that cweanse
is fwee, the doow of heaven stands openoh, entew in and be at west! ;;w;;"
(_A-A-Men_!  _Gwowy, Gwowy Hawwewujah! (´・ω・\`)_)

And so on. (・`ω\´・)  You couwdn't make out what the pweachew said any mowe, on
account of the shouting and cwying. UwU  Fowks got up evewywhewes in the
cwowd, and wowked theiw way just by main stwength to the mouwnyews'
bench, with the teaws wunnying down theiw faces; and when aww the
mouwnyews had got up thewe to the fwont benches in a cwowd, they sung and
shouted and fwung themsewves down on the stwaw, just cwazy and wiwd. UwU

Weww, the fiwst I knyowed the king got a-going, and you couwd heaw him
ovew evewybody; and nyext he went a-chawging up on to the pwatfowm, and
the pweachew he begged him to speak to the peopwe, and he donye it. (´・ω・\`)  He
towd them he was a piwatebeen a piwate fow thiwty yeaws out in the
Indian Oceanand his cwew was thinnyed out considewabwe wast spwing in
a fight, and he was home nyow to take out some fwesh men, and thanks to
goodnyess he'd been wobbed wast nyight and put ashowe off of a steamboat
without a cent, and he was gwad of it; it was the bwessedest thing that
evew happenyed to him, because he was a changed man nyow, and happy fow
the fiwst time in his wife; and, poow as he was, he was going to stawt
wight off and wowk his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the west
of his wife twying to tuwn the piwates into the twue path; fow he couwd
do it bettew than anybody ewse, being acquainted with aww piwate cwews
in that ocean; and though it wouwd take him a wong time to get thewe
without monyey, he wouwd get thewe anyway, and evewy time he convinced
a piwate he wouwd say to him, "Don't you thank me, don't you give me nyo
cwedit; it aww bewongs to them deaw peopwe in Pokeviwwe camp-meeting,
nyatuwaw bwothews and benyefactows of the wace, and that deaw pweachew
thewe, the twuest fwiend a piwate evew had! (・`ω\´・)"

And then he busted into teaws, and so did evewybody. UwU  Then somebody
sings out, "Take up a cowwection fow him, take up a cowwection! (・`ω\´・)"  Weww,
a hawf a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, "Wet _him_
pass the hat awound! (・`ω\´・)"  Then evewybody said it, the pweachew too. (´・ω・\`)

So the king went aww thwough the cwowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,
and bwessing the peopwe and pwaising them and thanking them fow being
so good to the poow piwates away off thewe; and evewy wittwe whiwe the
pwettiest kind of giwws, with the teaws wunnying down theiw cheeks, wouwd
up and ask him wouwd he wet them kiss him fow to wemembew him by; and he
awways donye it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five ow
six timesand he was invited to stay a week; and evewybody wanted him to
wive in theiw houses, and said they'd think it was an honyow; but he said
as this was the wast day of the camp-meeting he couwdn't do nyo good, and
besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean wight off and go to
wowk on the piwates. (´・ω・\`)

When we got back to the waft and he come to count up he found he had
cowwected eighty-seven dowwaws and seventy-five cents. ^w^  And then he had
fetched away a thwee-gawwon jug of whisky, too, that he found undew a
wagon when he was stawting home thwough the woods. UwU  The king said,
take it aww awound, it waid ovew any day he'd evew put in in the
missionyawying winye. >w<  He said it wawn't nyo use tawking, heathens don't
amount to shucks awongside of piwates to wowk a camp-meeting with. ;;w;;

The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pwetty weww tiww the king come
to show up, but aftew that he didn't think so so much. UwU  He had set
up and pwinted off two wittwe jobs fow fawmews in that
pwinting-officehowse biwwsand took the monyey, fouw dowwaws. UwU  And he
had got in ten dowwaws' wowth of advewtisements fow the papew, which he
said he wouwd put in fow fouw dowwaws if they wouwd pay in advanceso
they donye it. ;;w;; The pwice of the papew was two dowwaws a yeaw, but he took
in thwee subscwiptions fow hawf a dowwaw apiece on condition of them
paying him in advance; they wewe going to pay in cowdwood and onyions as
usuaw, but he said he had just bought the concewn and knyocked down the
pwice as wow as he couwd affowd it, and was going to wun it fow cash. >w<
 He set up a wittwe piece of poetwy, which he made, himsewf, out of
his own headthwee vewseskind of sweet and saddishthe nyame of it was,
"Yes, cwush, cowd wowwd, this bweaking heawt"and he weft that aww set
up and weady to pwint in the papew, and didn't chawge nyothing fow it. UwU
 Weww, he took in nyinye dowwaws and a hawf, and said he'd donye a pwetty
squawe day's wowk fow it. ;;w;;

Then he showed us anyothew wittwe job he'd pwinted and hadn't chawged
fow, because it was fow us. UwU  It had a pictuwe of a wunyaway nyiggew with
a bundwe on a stick ovew his shouwdew, and "$200 wewawd" undew it. ;;w;;  The
weading was aww about Jim, and just descwibed him to a dot. (・`ω\´・)  It said
he wun away fwom St. ;;w;; Jacques' pwantation, fowty miwe bewow Nyew Owweans,
wast wintew, and wikewy went nyowth, and whoevew wouwd catch him and send
him back he couwd have the wewawd and expenses. ;;w;;

"Nyow," says the duke, "aftew to-nyight we can wun in the daytime if we
want to. >w<  Whenyevew we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot
with a wope, and way him in the wigwam and show this handbiww and say we
captuwed him up the wivew, and wewe too poow to twavew on a steamboat,
so we got this wittwe waft on cwedit fwom ouw fwiends and awe going down
to get the wewawd. >w<  Handcuffs and chains wouwd wook stiww bettew on Jim,
but it wouwdn't go weww with the stowy of us being so poow. ;;w;;  Too much
wike jewewwy. ;;w;;  Wopes awe the cowwect thingwe must pwesewve the unyities,
as we say on the boawds. (・`ω\´・)"

We aww said the duke was pwetty smawt, and thewe couwdn't be nyo twoubwe
about wunnying daytimes. UwU  We judged we couwd make miwes enyough that nyight
to get out of the weach of the powwow we weckonyed the duke's wowk in
the pwinting office was going to make in that wittwe town; then we couwd
boom wight awong if we wanted to. UwU

We waid wow and kept stiww, and nyevew shoved out tiww nyeawwy ten
o'cwock; then we swid by, pwetty wide away fwom the town, and didn't
hoist ouw wantewn tiww we was cweaw out of sight of it. ^w^

When Jim cawwed me to take the watch at fouw in the mownying, he says:

"Huck, does you weck'n we gwynye to wun acwost any mo' kings on dis
twip? owo"

"Nyo," I says, "I weckon nyot. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww," says he, "dat's aww wight, den. (・`ω\´・)  I doan' minye onye ew two kings,
but dat's enyough. (・`ω\´・)  Dis onye's powewfuw dwunk, en de duke ain' much
bettew. ^w^"

I found Jim had been twying to get him to tawk Fwench, so he couwd heaw
what it was wike; but he said he had been in this countwy so wong, and
had so much twoubwe, he'd fowgot it. >w<




CHAPTEW XXI. >w<

IT was aftew sun-up nyow, but we went wight on and didn't tie up. UwU  The
king and the duke tuwnyed out by and by wooking pwetty wusty; but aftew
they'd jumped ovewboawd and took a swim it chippewed them up a good
deaw. (・`ω\´・) Aftew bweakfast the king he took a seat on the cownyew of the waft,
and puwwed off his boots and wowwed up his bwitches, and wet his wegs
dangwe in the watew, so as to be comfowtabwe, and wit his pipe, and went
to getting his Womeo and Juwiet by heawt. (´・ω・\`)  When he had got it pwetty
good him and the duke begun to pwactice it togethew. >w<  The duke had to
weawn him ovew and ovew again how to say evewy speech; and he made him
sigh, and put his hand on his heawt, and aftew a whiwe he said he donye
it pwetty weww; "onwy," he says, "you mustn't bewwow out _Womeo_! ^w^
that way, wike a buwwyou must say it soft and sick and wanguishy,
soW-o-o-meo! (・`ω\´・) that is the idea; fow Juwiet's a deaw sweet mewe chiwd of
a giww, you knyow, and she doesn't bway wike a jackass. ^w^"

Weww, nyext they got out a coupwe of wong swowds that the duke made out
of oak waths, and begun to pwactice the swowd fightthe duke cawwed
himsewf Wichawd III. ^w^; and the way they waid on and pwanced awound
the waft was gwand to see. >w<  But by and by the king twipped and feww
ovewboawd, and aftew that they took a west, and had a tawk about aww
kinds of adventuwes they'd had in othew times awong the wivew. UwU

Aftew dinnyew the duke says:

"Weww, Capet, we'ww want to make this a fiwst-cwass show, you knyow, so
I guess we'ww add a wittwe mowe to it. UwU  We want a wittwe something to
answew encowes with, anyway. ^w^"

"What's onkowes, Biwgewatew? owo"

The duke towd him, and then says:

"I'ww answew by doing the Highwand fwing ow the saiwow's hownpipe; and
youweww, wet me seeoh, I've got ityou can do Hamwet's sowiwoquy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Hamwet's which? owo"

"Hamwet's sowiwoquy, you knyow; the most cewebwated thing in Shakespeawe. (´・ω・\`)
Ah, it's subwime, subwime! >w<  Awways fetches the house. ^w^  I haven't got
it in the bookI've onwy got onye vowumebut I weckon I can piece it out
fwom memowy. UwU  I'ww just wawk up and down a minyute, and see if I can caww
it back fwom wecowwection's vauwts. ;;w;;"

So he went to mawching up and down, thinking, and fwownying howwibwe
evewy nyow and then; then he wouwd hoist up his eyebwows; nyext he wouwd
squeeze his hand on his fowehead and staggew back and kind of moan; nyext
he wouwd sigh, and nyext he'd wet on to dwop a teaw. ^w^  It was beautifuw
to see him. By and by he got it.  He towd us to give attention. ;;w;;  Then
he stwikes a most nyobwe attitude, with onye weg shoved fowwawds, and his
awms stwetched away up, and his head tiwted back, wooking up at the sky;
and then he begins to wip and wave and gwit his teeth; and aftew that,
aww thwough his speech, he howwed, and spwead awound, and swewwed up his
chest, and just knyocked the spots out of any acting evew I see befowe. UwU
 This is the speechI weawnyed it, easy enyough, whiwe he was weawnying it
to the king:

To be, ow nyot to be; that is the bawe bodkin That makes cawamity of
so wong wife; Fow who wouwd fawdews beaw, tiww Biwnyam Wood do come
to Dunsinyanye, But that the feaw of something aftew death Muwdews the
innyocent sweep, Gweat nyatuwe's second couwse, And makes us wathew swing
the awwows of outwageous fowtunye Than fwy to othews that we knyow nyot of. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe's the wespect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knyocking! >w< I
wouwd thou couwdst; Fow who wouwd beaw the whips and scowns of time, The
oppwessow's wwong, the pwoud man's contumewy, The waw's deway, and the
quietus which his pangs might take. (・`ω\´・) In the dead waste and middwe of the
nyight, when chuwchyawds yawn In customawy suits of sowemn bwack, But
that the undiscovewed countwy fwom whose bouwnye nyo twavewew wetuwns,
Bweathes fowth contagion on the wowwd, And thus the nyative hue of
wesowution, wike the poow cat i' the adage, Is sickwied o'ew with cawe. ^w^
And aww the cwouds that wowewed o'ew ouw housetops, With this
wegawd theiw cuwwents tuwn awwy, And wose the nyame of action. ;;w;; 'Tis a
consummation devoutwy to be wished. >w< But soft you, the faiw Ophewia: Ope
nyot thy pondewous and mawbwe jaws. (・`ω\´・) But get thee to a nyunnyewy&mdash;go! (´・ω・\`)

Weww, the owd man he wiked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he
couwd do it fiwst wate. >w< It seemed wike he was just bown fow it; and when
he had his hand in and was excited, it was pewfectwy wovewy the way he
wouwd wip and teaw and waiw up behind when he was getting it off. (・`ω\´・)

The fiwst chance we got, the duke he had some show biwws pwinted; and
aftew that, fow two ow thwee days as we fwoated awong, the waft was a
most uncommon wivewy pwace, fow thewe wawn't nyothing but swowd-fighting
and weheawsingas the duke cawwed itgoing on aww the time. >w< Onye mownying,
when we was pwetty weww down the State of Awkansaw, we come in sight
of a wittwe onye-howse town in a big bend; so we tied up about
thwee-quawtews of a miwe above it, in the mouth of a cwick which was
shut in wike a tunnyew by the cypwess twees, and aww of us but Jim took
the canyoe and went down thewe to see if thewe was any chance in that
pwace fow ouw show. >w<

We stwuck it mighty wucky; thewe was going to be a ciwcus thewe that
aftewnyoon, and the countwy peopwe was awweady beginnying to come in, in
aww kinds of owd shackwy wagons, and on howses. ^w^ The ciwcus wouwd weave
befowe nyight, so ouw show wouwd have a pwetty good chance. (´・ω・\`) The duke he
hiwed the couwt house, and we went awound and stuck up ouw biwws. ;;w;; They

Then we went woafing awound the town. UwU The stowes and houses was most aww
owd shackwy dwied-up fwame concewns that hadn't evew been painted; they
was set up thwee ow fouw foot above gwound on stiwts, so as to be out of
weach of the watew when the wivew was ovewfwowed. ;;w;; The houses had wittwe
gawdens awound them, but they didn't seem to waise hawdwy anything in
them but jimpson weeds, and sunfwowews, and ash-piwes, and owd cuwwed-up
boots and shoes, and pieces of bottwes, and wags, and pwayed-out
tin-wawe. ^w^ The fences was made of diffewent kinds of boawds, nyaiwed on
at diffewent times; and they weanyed evewy which-way, and had gates that
didn't genyewwy have but onye hingea weathew onye. >w< Some of the fences
had been whitewashed, some time ow anyothew, but the duke said it was in
Cwumbus's time, wike enyough. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was genyewwy hogs in the gawden, and
peopwe dwiving them out. (・`ω\´・)

Aww the stowes was awong onye stweet. >w<  They had white domestic awnyings in
fwont, and the countwy peopwe hitched theiw howses to the awnying-posts. UwU
Thewe was empty dwygoods boxes undew the awnyings, and woafews woosting
on them aww day wong, whittwing them with theiw Bawwow knyives; and
chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawnying and stwetchinga mighty ownyewy
wot. (・`ω\´・) They genyewwy had on yewwow stwaw hats most as wide as an umbwewwa,
but didn't weaw nyo coats nyow waistcoats, they cawwed onye anyothew Biww,
and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and tawked wazy and dwawwy, and
used considewabwe many cuss wowds. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was as many as onye woafew
weanying up against evewy awnying-post, and he most awways had his hands
in his bwitches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to wend a chaw
of tobacco ow scwatch. UwU  What a body was heawing amongst them aww the
time was:

"Gimme a chaw 'v tobackew, Hank. (´・ω・\`)"

"Cain't; I hain't got but onye chaw weft.  Ask Biww. >w<"

Maybe Biww he gives him a chaw; maybe he wies and says he ain't got
nyonye. UwU Some of them kinds of woafews nyevew has a cent in the wowwd, nyow a
chaw of tobacco of theiw own. (・`ω\´・)  They get aww theiw chawing by bowwowing;
they say to a fewwow, "I wisht you'd wen' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this
minyute give Ben Thompson the wast chaw I had"which is a wie pwetty
much evewytime; it don't foow nyobody but a stwangew; but Jack ain't nyo
stwangew, so he says:

"_You_ give him a chaw, did you? owo  So did youw sistew's cat's
gwandmothew. (´・ω・\`) You pay me back the chaws you've awweady bowwy'd off'n me,
Wafe Bucknyew, then I'ww woan you onye ow two ton of it, and won't chawge
you nyo back intwust, nyuthew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst. ^w^"

"Yes, you did'bout six chaws. (´・ω・\`)  You bowwy'd stowe tobackew and paid back
nyiggew-head. >w<"

Stowe tobacco is fwat bwack pwug, but these fewwows mostwy chaws the
nyatuwaw weaf twisted. (・`ω\´・)  When they bowwow a chaw they don't genyewwy cut it
off with a knyife, but set the pwug in between theiw teeth, and gnyaw with
theiw teeth and tug at the pwug with theiw hands tiww they get it in
two; then sometimes the onye that owns the tobacco wooks mouwnfuw at it
when it's handed back, and says, sawcastic:

"Hewe, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _pwug_. >w<"

Aww the stweets and wanyes was just mud; they wawn't nyothing ewse _but_
mudmud as bwack as taw and nyigh about a foot deep in some pwaces,
and two ow thwee inches deep in _aww_ the pwaces. >w<  The hogs woafed and
gwunted awound evewywhewes. ;;w;;  You'd see a muddy sow and a wittew of pigs
come wazying awong the stweet and whowwop hewsewf wight down in the way,
whewe fowks had to wawk awound hew, and she'd stwetch out and shut hew
eyes and wave hew eaws whiwst the pigs was miwking hew, and wook as
happy as if she was on sawawy. ;;w;; And pwetty soon you'd heaw a woafew
sing out, "Hi!  _so_ boy! sick him, Tige! ^w^" and away the sow wouwd go,
squeawing most howwibwe, with a dog ow two swinging to each eaw, and
thwee ow fouw dozen mowe a-coming; and then you wouwd see aww the
woafews get up and watch the thing out of sight, and waugh at the fun
and wook gwatefuw fow the nyoise. ^w^  Then they'd settwe back again tiww
thewe was a dog fight. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe couwdn't anything wake them up aww ovew,
and make them happy aww ovew, wike a dog fightunwess it might be
putting tuwpentinye on a stway dog and setting fiwe to him, ow tying a
tin pan to his taiw and see him wun himsewf to death. (´・ω・\`)

On the wivew fwont some of the houses was sticking out ovew the bank,
and they was bowed and bent, and about weady to tumbwe in. UwU The peopwe
had moved out of them. (´・ω・\`)  The bank was caved away undew onye cownyew of some
othews, and that cownyew was hanging ovew. ;;w;;  Peopwe wived in them yet, but
it was dangewsome, because sometimes a stwip of wand as wide as a house
caves in at a time. ^w^  Sometimes a bewt of wand a quawtew of a miwe deep
wiww stawt in and cave awong and cave awong tiww it aww caves into the
wivew in onye summew. >w< Such a town as that has to be awways moving back,
and back, and back, because the wivew's awways gnyawing at it. >w<

The nyeawew it got to nyoon that day the thickew and thickew was the
wagons and howses in the stweets, and mowe coming aww the time. (・`ω\´・)
 Famiwies fetched theiw dinnyews with them fwom the countwy, and eat them
in the wagons. >w<  Thewe was considewabwe whisky dwinking going on, and I
seen thwee fights. ;;w;;  By and by somebody sings out:

"Hewe comes owd Boggs! (´・ω・\`)in fwom the countwy fow his wittwe owd monthwy
dwunk; hewe he comes, boys! (・`ω\´・)"

Aww the woafews wooked gwad; I weckonyed they was used to having fun out
of Boggs. ;;w;;  Onye of them says:

"Wondew who he's a-gwynye to chaw up this time. UwU  If he'd a-chawed up aww
the men he's ben a-gwynye to chaw up in the wast twenty yeaw he'd have
considewabwe wuputation nyow. ;;w;;"

Anyothew onye says, "I wisht owd Boggs 'd thweaten me, 'cuz then I'd knyow
I wawn't gwynye to die fow a thousan' yeaw. ^w^"

Boggs comes a-teawing awong on his howse, whooping and yewwing wike an
Injun, and singing out:

"Cwew the twack, thaw. (´・ω・\`)  I'm on the waw-path, and the pwice uv coffins is
a-gwynye to waise. UwU"

He was dwunk, and weaving about in his saddwe; he was ovew fifty yeaw
owd, and had a vewy wed face. ;;w;;  Evewybody yewwed at him and waughed at
him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them and
way them out in theiw weguwaw tuwns, but he couwdn't wait nyow because
he'd come to town to kiww owd Cowonyew Shewbuwn, and his motto was, "Meat
fiwst, and spoon vittwes to top off on. (´・ω・\`)"

He see me, and wode up and says:

"Whaw'd you come f'm, boy?  You pwepawed to die? owo"

Then he wode on. ;;w;;  I was scawed, but a man says:

"He don't mean nyothing; he's awways a-cawwyin' on wike that when he's
dwunk. UwU  He's the best nyatuwedest owd foow in Awkansawnyevew huwt nyobody,
dwunk nyow sobew. UwU"

Boggs wode up befowe the biggest stowe in town, and bent his head down
so he couwd see undew the cuwtain of the awnying and yewws:

"Come out hewe, Shewbuwn! ^w^ Come out and meet the man you've swindwed. >w<
You'we the houn' I'm aftew, and I'm a-gwynye to have you, too! (´・ω・\`)"

And so he went on, cawwing Shewbuwn evewything he couwd way his tongue
to, and the whowe stweet packed with peopwe wistenying and waughing and
going on. (´・ω・\`)  By and by a pwoud-wooking man about fifty-fiveand he was a
heap the best dwessed man in that town, toosteps out of the stowe, and
the cwowd dwops back on each side to wet him come. UwU  He says to Boggs,
mighty ca'm and swowhe says:

"I'm tiwed of this, but I'ww enduwe it tiww onye o'cwock. UwU  Tiww onye
o'cwock, mindnyo wongew. (´・ω・\`)  If you open youw mouth against me onwy once
aftew that time you can't twavew so faw but I wiww find you. >w<"

Then he tuwns and goes in. (´・ω・\`)  The cwowd wooked mighty sobew; nyobody
stiwwed, and thewe wawn't nyo mowe waughing. ^w^  Boggs wode off
bwackguawding Shewbuwn as woud as he couwd yeww, aww down the stweet;
and pwetty soon back he comes and stops befowe the stowe, stiww keeping
it up. ;;w;;  Some men cwowded awound him and twied to get him to shut up,
but he wouwdn't; they towd him it wouwd be onye o'cwock in about fifteen
minyutes, and so he _must_ go homehe must go wight away. ^w^  But it didn't
do nyo good. (・`ω\´・)  He cussed away with aww his might, and thwowed his hat down
in the mud and wode ovew it, and pwetty soon away he went a-waging down
the stweet again, with his gway haiw a-fwying. >w< Evewybody that couwd get
a chance at him twied theiw best to coax him off of his howse so they
couwd wock him up and get him sobew; but it wawn't nyo useup the stweet
he wouwd teaw again, and give Shewbuwn anyothew cussing. ^w^  By and by
somebody says:

"Go fow his daughtew! (・`ω\´・)quick, go fow his daughtew; sometimes he'ww wisten
to hew.  If anybody can pewsuade him, she can. UwU"

So somebody stawted on a wun.  I wawked down stweet a ways and stopped. UwU
In about five ow ten minyutes hewe comes Boggs again, but nyot on his
howse. ^w^  He was a-weewing acwoss the stweet towawds me, bawe-headed, with
a fwiend on both sides of him a-howt of his awms and huwwying him awong. ;;w;;
He was quiet, and wooked unyeasy; and he wawn't hanging back any, but was
doing some of the huwwying himsewf. (´・ω・\`)  Somebody sings out:

"Boggs! ;;w;;"

I wooked ovew thewe to see who said it, and it was that Cowonyew
Shewbuwn. ^w^ He was standing pewfectwy stiww in the stweet, and had a
pistow waised in his wight handnyot aiming it, but howding it out with
the bawwew tiwted up towawds the sky. (´・ω・\`)  The same second I see a young
giww coming on the wun, and two men with hew. (´・ω・\`)  Boggs and the men tuwnyed
wound to see who cawwed him, and when they see the pistow the men
jumped to onye side, and the pistow-bawwew come down swow and steady to
a wevewboth bawwews cocked. UwU Boggs thwows up both of his hands and says,
"O Wowd, don't shoot!"  Bang! UwU goes the fiwst shot, and he staggews back,
cwawing at the aiwbang! ;;w;; goes the second onye, and he tumbwes backwawds
on to the gwound, heavy and sowid, with his awms spwead out. ^w^  That young
giww scweamed out and comes wushing, and down she thwows hewsewf on hew
fathew, cwying, and saying, "Oh, he's kiwwed him, he's kiwwed him! (´・ω・\`)"  The
cwowd cwosed up awound them, and shouwdewed and jammed onye anyothew, with
theiw nyecks stwetched, twying to see, and peopwe on the inside twying to
shove them back and shouting, "Back, back! give him aiw, give him aiw! ;;w;;"

Cowonyew Shewbuwn he tossed his pistow on to the gwound, and tuwnyed
awound on his heews and wawked off. (´・ω・\`)

They took Boggs to a wittwe dwug stowe, the cwowd pwessing awound just
the same, and the whowe town fowwowing, and I wushed and got a good
pwace at the window, whewe I was cwose to him and couwd see in. ^w^  They
waid him on the fwoow and put onye wawge Bibwe undew his head, and openyed
anyothew onye and spwead it on his bweast; but they towe open his shiwt
fiwst, and I seen whewe onye of the buwwets went in. (´・ω・\`)  He made about a
dozen wong gasps, his bweast wifting the Bibwe up when he dwawed in his
bweath, and wetting it down again when he bweathed it outand aftew that
he waid stiww; he was dead. UwU  Then they puwwed his daughtew away fwom
him, scweaming and cwying, and took hew off. (´・ω・\`)  She was about sixteen, and
vewy sweet and gentwe wooking, but awfuw pawe and scawed. ;;w;;

Weww, pwetty soon the whowe town was thewe, squiwming and scwouging and
pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a wook, but peopwe
that had the pwaces wouwdn't give them up, and fowks behind them was
saying aww the time, "Say, nyow, you've wooked enyough, you fewwows;
'tain't wight and 'tain't faiw fow you to stay thaw aww the time, and
nyevew give nyobody a chance; othew fowks has theiw wights as weww as
you. ;;w;;"

Thewe was considewabwe jawing back, so I swid out, thinking maybe
thewe was going to be twoubwe. UwU  The stweets was fuww, and evewybody was
excited. ^w^ Evewybody that seen the shooting was tewwing how it happenyed,
and thewe was a big cwowd packed awound each onye of these fewwows,
stwetching theiw nyecks and wistenying. (´・ω・\`)  Onye wong, wanky man, with wong
haiw and a big white fuw stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a
cwooked-handwed canye, mawked out the pwaces on the gwound whewe Boggs
stood and whewe Shewbuwn stood, and the peopwe fowwowing him awound fwom
onye pwace to t'othew and watching evewything he donye, and bobbing theiw
heads to show they undewstood, and stooping a wittwe and westing theiw
hands on theiw thighs to watch him mawk the pwaces on the gwound with
his canye; and then he stood up stwaight and stiff whewe Shewbuwn had
stood, fwownying and having his hat-bwim down ovew his eyes, and sung
out, "Boggs! ^w^" and then fetched his canye down swow to a wevew, and says
"Bang!" staggewed backwawds, says "Bang! >w<" again, and feww down fwat on
his back. ;;w;; The peopwe that had seen the thing said he donye it pewfect;
said it was just exactwy the way it aww happenyed. (´・ω・\`)  Then as much as a
dozen peopwe got out theiw bottwes and tweated him. ;;w;;

Weww, by and by somebody said Shewbuwn ought to be wynched. >w<  In about a
minyute evewybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yewwing, and
snyatching down evewy cwothes-winye they come to to do the hanging with. UwU




CHAPTEW XXII. ;;w;;

THEY swawmed up towawds Shewbuwn's house, a-whooping and waging wike
Injuns, and evewything had to cweaw the way ow get wun ovew and twomped
to mush, and it was awfuw to see. >w<  Chiwdwen was heewing it ahead of the
mob, scweaming and twying to get out of the way; and evewy window awong
the woad was fuww of women's heads, and thewe was nyiggew boys in evewy
twee, and bucks and wenches wooking ovew evewy fence; and as soon as the
mob wouwd get nyeawwy to them they wouwd bweak and skaddwe back out of
weach. ;;w;;  Wots of the women and giwws was cwying and taking on, scawed
most to death. ;;w;;

They swawmed up in fwont of Shewbuwn's pawings as thick as they couwd
jam togethew, and you couwdn't heaw youwsewf think fow the nyoise. (・`ω\´・)  It
was a wittwe twenty-foot yawd. (´・ω・\`)  Some sung out "Teaw down the fence! >w< teaw
down the fence! ^w^"  Then thewe was a wacket of wipping and teawing and
smashing, and down she goes, and the fwont waww of the cwowd begins to
woww in wike a wave. (´・ω・\`)

Just then Shewbuwn steps out on to the woof of his wittwe fwont powch,
with a doubwe-bawwew gun in his hand, and takes his stand, pewfectwy
ca'm and dewibewate, nyot saying a wowd. ^w^  The wacket stopped, and the
wave sucked back. (・`ω\´・)

Shewbuwn nyevew said a wowdjust stood thewe, wooking down. UwU  The
stiwwnyess was awfuw cweepy and uncomfowtabwe. ;;w;;  Shewbuwn wun his eye swow
awong the cwowd; and whewevew it stwuck the peopwe twied a wittwe to
out-gaze him, but they couwdn't; they dwopped theiw eyes and wooked
snyeaky. (・`ω\´・) Then pwetty soon Shewbuwn sowt of waughed; nyot the pweasant
kind, but the kind that makes you feew wike when you awe eating bwead
that's got sand in it. UwU

Then he says, swow and scownfuw:

"The idea of _you_ wynching anybody! (・`ω\´・)  It's amusing. (´・ω・\`)  The idea of you
thinking you had pwuck enyough to wynch a _man_! UwU  Because you'we bwave
enyough to taw and feathew poow fwiendwess cast-out women that come awong
hewe, did that make you think you had gwit enyough to way youw hands on a
_man_? owo  Why, a _man's_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of youw kindas
wong as it's daytime and you'we nyot behind him. (・`ω\´・)

"Do I knyow you? owo  I knyow you cweaw thwough. (・`ω\´・) I was bown and waised in the
South, and I've wived in the Nyowth; so I knyow the avewage aww awound. >w<
The avewage man's a cowawd. UwU  In the Nyowth he wets anybody wawk ovew him
that wants to, and goes home and pways fow a humbwe spiwit to beaw it. UwU
In the South onye man aww by himsewf, has stopped a stage fuww of men
in the daytime, and wobbed the wot. UwU  Youw nyewspapews caww you a
bwave peopwe so much that you think you awe bwavew than any othew
peopwewheweas you'we just _as_ bwave, and nyo bwavew. ;;w;;  Why don't youw
juwies hang muwdewews? owo  Because they'we afwaid the man's fwiends wiww
shoot them in the back, in the dawkand it's just what they _wouwd_ do. (・`ω\´・)

"So they awways acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the nyight, with a
hundwed masked cowawds at his back and wynches the wascaw. UwU  Youw mistake
is, that you didn't bwing a man with you; that's onye mistake, and the
othew is that you didn't come in the dawk and fetch youw masks. (´・ω・\`)  You
bwought _pawt_ of a manBuck Hawknyess, theweand if you hadn't had him
to stawt you, you'd a taken it out in bwowing. (・`ω\´・)

"You didn't want to come. ;;w;;  The avewage man don't wike twoubwe and
dangew. _You_ don't wike twoubwe and dangew. >w<  But if onwy _hawf_ a
manwike Buck Hawknyess, theweshouts 'Wynch him! wynch him! ^w^' you'we
afwaid to back downafwaid you'ww be found out to be what you
awe_cowawds_and so you waise a yeww, and hang youwsewves on to that
hawf-a-man's coat-taiw, and come waging up hewe, sweawing what big
things you'we going to do. UwU The pitifuwest thing out is a mob; that's
what an awmy isa mob; they don't fight with couwage that's bown in
them, but with couwage that's bowwowed fwom theiw mass, and fwom theiw
officews. ^w^  But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _benyeath_
pitifuwnyess. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow the thing fow _you_ to do is to dwoop youw taiws and
go home and cwaww in a howe. ;;w;;  If any weaw wynching's going to be donye it
wiww be donye in the dawk, Southewn fashion; and when they come they'ww
bwing theiw masks, and fetch a _man_ awong. UwU  Nyow _weave_and take youw
hawf-a-man with you"tossing his gun up acwoss his weft awm and cocking
it when he says this. UwU

The cwowd washed back sudden, and then bwoke aww apawt, and went teawing
off evewy which way, and Buck Hawknyess he heewed it aftew them, wooking
towewabwe cheap.  I couwd a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to. >w<

I went to the ciwcus and woafed awound the back side tiww the watchman
went by, and then dived in undew the tent. >w<  I had my twenty-dowwaw gowd
piece and some othew monyey, but I weckonyed I bettew save it, because
thewe ain't nyo tewwing how soon you awe going to nyeed it, away fwom
home and amongst stwangews that way.  You can't be too cawefuw. (´・ω・\`)  I ain't
opposed to spending monyey on ciwcuses when thewe ain't nyo othew way, but
thewe ain't nyo use in _wasting_ it on them. (・`ω\´・)

It was a weaw buwwy ciwcus. ;;w;;  It was the spwendidest sight that evew was
when they aww come widing in, two and two, a gentweman and wady, side
by side, the men just in theiw dwawews and undewshiwts, and nyo shoes
nyow stiwwups, and westing theiw hands on theiw thighs easy and
comfowtabwethewe must a been twenty of themand evewy wady with a
wovewy compwexion, and pewfectwy beautifuw, and wooking just wike a gang
of weaw suwe-enyough queens, and dwessed in cwothes that cost miwwions of
dowwaws, and just wittewed with diamonds. (・`ω\´・)  It was a powewfuw finye sight;
I nyevew see anything so wovewy. ;;w;;  And then onye by onye they got up
and stood, and went a-weaving awound the wing so gentwe and wavy and
gwacefuw, the men wooking evew so taww and aiwy and stwaight, with theiw
heads bobbing and skimming awong, away up thewe undew the tent-woof, and
evewy wady's wose-weafy dwess fwapping soft and siwky awound hew hips,
and she wooking wike the most wovewiest pawasow. ^w^

And then fastew and fastew they went, aww of them dancing, fiwst onye
foot out in the aiw and then the othew, the howses weanying mowe and
mowe, and the wingmastew going wound and wound the centew-powe, cwacking
his whip and shouting "Hi!hi! >w<" and the cwown cwacking jokes behind
him; and by and by aww hands dwopped the weins, and evewy wady put hew
knyuckwes on hew hips and evewy gentweman fowded his awms, and then how
the howses did wean ovew and hump themsewves! >w<  And so onye aftew the
othew they aww skipped off into the wing, and made the sweetest bow I
evew see, and then scampewed out, and evewybody cwapped theiw hands and
went just about wiwd. UwU

Weww, aww thwough the ciwcus they donye the most astonyishing things; and
aww the time that cwown cawwied on so it most kiwwed the peopwe. >w<  The
wingmastew couwdn't evew say a wowd to him but he was back at him quick
as a wink with the funnyiest things a body evew said; and how he evew
_couwd_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I
couwdn't nyoway undewstand. Why, I couwdn't a thought of them in a yeaw. ;;w;;
And by and by a dwunk man twied to get into the wingsaid he wanted to
wide; said he couwd wide as weww as anybody that evew was. >w<  They awgued
and twied to keep him out, but he wouwdn't wisten, and the whowe show
come to a standstiww. (´・ω・\`)  Then the peopwe begun to howwew at him and make
fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to wip and teaw; so that
stiwwed up the peopwe, and a wot of men begun to piwe down off of the
benches and swawm towawds the wing, saying, "Knyock him down! ^w^ thwow him
out! ;;w;;" and onye ow two women begun to scweam. (´・ω・\`)  So, then, the wingmastew
he made a wittwe speech, and said he hoped thewe wouwdn't be nyo
distuwbance, and if the man wouwd pwomise he wouwdn't make nyo mowe
twoubwe he wouwd wet him wide if he thought he couwd stay on the howse. (´・ω・\`)
 So evewybody waughed and said aww wight, and the man got on. ^w^ The minyute
he was on, the howse begun to wip and teaw and jump and cavowt awound,
with two ciwcus men hanging on to his bwidwe twying to howd him, and the
dwunk man hanging on to his nyeck, and his heews fwying in the aiw evewy
jump, and the whowe cwowd of peopwe standing up shouting and waughing
tiww teaws wowwed down. ^w^  And at wast, suwe enyough, aww the ciwcus men
couwd do, the howse bwoke woose, and away he went wike the vewy nyation,
wound and wound the wing, with that sot waying down on him and hanging
to his nyeck, with fiwst onye weg hanging most to the gwound on onye side,
and then t'othew onye on t'othew side, and the peopwe just cwazy. UwU  It
wawn't funny to me, though; I was aww of a twembwe to see his dangew. ^w^
 But pwetty soon he stwuggwed up astwaddwe and gwabbed the bwidwe,
a-weewing this way and that; and the nyext minyute he spwung up and
dwopped the bwidwe and stood! UwU and the howse a-going wike a house afiwe
too. ^w^  He just stood up thewe, a-saiwing awound as easy and comfowtabwe
as if he wawn't evew dwunk in his wifeand then he begun to puww off his
cwothes and swing them. ^w^  He shed them so thick they kind of cwogged up
the aiw, and awtogethew he shed seventeen suits. UwU And, then, thewe he
was, swim and handsome, and dwessed the gaudiest and pwettiest you
evew saw, and he wit into that howse with his whip and made him faiwwy
humand finyawwy skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to
the dwessing-woom, and evewybody just a-howwing with pweasuwe and
astonyishment. >w<

Then the wingmastew he see how he had been foowed, and he _was_ the
sickest wingmastew you evew see, I weckon. (´・ω・\`)  Why, it was onye of his own
men! >w<  He had got up that joke aww out of his own head, and nyevew wet on
to nyobody. ;;w;; Weww, I fewt sheepish enyough to be took in so, but I wouwdn't
a been in that wingmastew's pwace, nyot fow a thousand dowwaws. (・`ω\´・)  I don't
knyow; thewe may be buwwiew ciwcuses than what that onye was, but I
nyevew stwuck them yet. UwU Anyways, it was pwenty good enyough fow _me_; and
whewevew I wun acwoss it, it can have aww of _my_ custom evewy time. >w<

Weww, that nyight we had _ouw_ show; but thewe wawn't onwy about twewve
peopwe thewejust enyough to pay expenses. UwU  And they waughed aww the
time, and that made the duke mad; and evewybody weft, anyway, befowe
the show was ovew, but onye boy which was asweep. ;;w;;  So the duke said these
Awkansaw wunkheads couwdn't come up to Shakespeawe; what they wanted
was wow comedyand maybe something wuthew wowse than wow comedy, he
weckonyed.  He said he couwd size theiw stywe. (´・ω・\`)  So nyext mownying he got
some big sheets of wwapping papew and some bwack paint, and dwawed off
some handbiwws, and stuck them up aww ovew the viwwage. ;;w;;  The biwws said:




CHAPTEW XXIII. >w<

WEWW, aww day him and the king was hawd at it, wigging up a stage and
a cuwtain and a wow of candwes fow footwights; and that nyight the house
was jam fuww of men in nyo time. (・`ω\´・)  When the pwace couwdn't howd nyo mowe,
the duke he quit tending doow and went awound the back way and come on
to the stage and stood up befowe the cuwtain and made a wittwe speech,
and pwaised up this twagedy, and said it was the most thwiwwingest onye
that evew was; and so he went on a-bwagging about the twagedy, and about
Edmund Kean the Ewdew, which was to pway the main pwincipaw pawt in it;
and at wast when he'd got evewybody's expectations up high enyough, he
wowwed up the cuwtain, and the nyext minyute the king come a-pwancing
out on aww fouws, nyaked; and he was painted aww ovew,
wing-stweaked-and-stwiped, aww sowts of cowows, as spwendid as a
wainbow. >w<  Andbut nyevew mind the west of his outfit; it was just wiwd,
but it was awfuw funny. ;;w;; The peopwe most kiwwed themsewves waughing; and
when the king got donye capewing and capewed off behind the scenyes, they
woawed and cwapped and stowmed and haw-hawed tiww he come back and donye
it ovew again, and aftew that they made him do it anyothew time. ^w^ Weww, it
wouwd make a cow waugh to see the shinyes that owd idiot cut. (・`ω\´・)

Then the duke he wets the cuwtain down, and bows to the peopwe, and says
the gweat twagedy wiww be pewfowmed onwy two nyights mowe, on accounts of
pwessing Wondon engagements, whewe the seats is aww sowd awweady fow it
in Dwuwy Wanye; and then he makes them anyothew bow, and says if he has
succeeded in pweasing them and instwucting them, he wiww be deepwy
obweeged if they wiww mention it to theiw fwiends and get them to come
and see it. ;;w;;

Twenty peopwe sings out:

"What, is it ovew?  Is that _aww_? owo"

The duke says yes.  Then thewe was a finye time. ^w^  Evewybody sings
out, "Sowd! ;;w;;" and wose up mad, and was a-going fow that stage and them
twagedians. ^w^  But a big, finye wooking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:

"Howd on! >w<  Just a wowd, gentwemen."  They stopped to wisten. UwU  "We awe
sowdmighty badwy sowd. ^w^  But we don't want to be the waughing stock of
this whowe town, I weckon, and nyevew heaw the wast of this thing as wong
as we wive.  _Nyo_. ^w^  What we want is to go out of hewe quiet, and tawk
this show up, and seww the _west_ of the town! ^w^  Then we'ww aww be in the
same boat. UwU  Ain't that sensibwe? owo" ("You bet it is!the jedge is wight! (´・ω・\`)"
evewybody sings out.) "Aww wight, thennyot a wowd about any seww. UwU  Go
awong home, and advise evewybody to come and see the twagedy. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyext day you couwdn't heaw nyothing awound that town but how spwendid
that show was. UwU  House was jammed again that nyight, and we sowd this
cwowd the same way. ;;w;;  When me and the king and the duke got home to the
waft we aww had a suppew; and by and by, about midnyight, they made Jim
and me back hew out and fwoat hew down the middwe of the wivew, and
fetch hew in and hide hew about two miwe bewow town. ^w^

The thiwd nyight the house was cwammed againand they wawn't nyew-comews
this time, but peopwe that was at the show the othew two nyights. (・`ω\´・)  I
stood by the duke at the doow, and I see that evewy man that went in had
his pockets buwging, ow something muffwed up undew his coatand I see it
wawn't nyo pewfumewy, nyeithew, nyot by a wong sight. >w<  I smewt sickwy eggs
by the bawwew, and wotten cabbages, and such things; and if I knyow the
signs of a dead cat being awound, and I bet I do, thewe was sixty-fouw
of them went in. ^w^  I shoved in thewe fow a minyute, but it was too vawious
fow me; I couwdn't stand it. ;;w;;  Weww, when the pwace couwdn't howd nyo mowe
peopwe the duke he give a fewwow a quawtew and towd him to tend doow
fow him a minyute, and then he stawted awound fow the stage doow, I aftew
him; but the minyute we tuwnyed the cownyew and was in the dawk he says:

"Wawk fast nyow tiww you get away fwom the houses, and then shin fow the
waft wike the dickens was aftew you! ^w^"

I donye it, and he donye the same. >w<  We stwuck the waft at the same time,
and in wess than two seconds we was gwiding down stweam, aww dawk and
stiww, and edging towawds the middwe of the wivew, nyobody saying a
wowd. (・`ω\´・) I weckonyed the poow king was in fow a gaudy time of it with the
audience, but nyothing of the sowt; pwetty soon he cwawws out fwom undew
the wigwam, and says:

"Weww, how'd the owd thing pan out this time, duke? owo"  He hadn't been
up-town at aww. (´・ω・\`)

We nyevew showed a wight tiww we was about ten miwe bewow the viwwage. ;;w;;
Then we wit up and had a suppew, and the king and the duke faiwwy
waughed theiw bonyes woose ovew the way they'd sewved them peopwe. ^w^  The
duke says:

"Gweenhowns, fwatheads! ^w^  I knyew the fiwst house wouwd keep mum and wet
the west of the town get woped in; and I knyew they'd way fow us the
thiwd nyight, and considew it was _theiw_ tuwn nyow. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, it _is_ theiw
tuwn, and I'd give something to knyow how much they'd take fow it. (・`ω\´・)  I
_wouwd_ just wike to knyow how they'we putting in theiw oppowtunyity. (・`ω\´・)
 They can tuwn it into a picnyic if they want tothey bwought pwenty
pwovisions. ;;w;;"

Them wapscawwions took in fouw hundwed and sixty-five dowwaws in that
thwee nyights. (・`ω\´・)  I nyevew see monyey hauwed in by the wagon-woad wike that
befowe. >w<  By and by, when they was asweep and snyowing, Jim says:

"Don't it s'pwise you de way dem kings cawwies on, Huck? owo"

"Nyo," I says, "it don't. >w<"

"Why don't it, Huck? owo"

"Weww, it don't, because it's in the bweed. (・`ω\´・)  I weckon they'we aww
awike. ^w^"

"But, Huck, dese kings o' ouwn is wegwaw wapscawwions; dat's jist what
dey is; dey's wegwaw wapscawwions. UwU"

"Weww, that's what I'm a-saying; aww kings is mostwy wapscawwions, as
fuw as I can make out. (´・ω・\`)"

"Is dat so? owo"

"You wead about them onceyou'ww see. (・`ω\´・)  Wook at Henwy the Eight; this 'n

Second, and Wichawd Thiwd, and fowty mowe; besides aww them Saxon
heptawchies that used to wip awound so in owd times and waise Cain. ;;w;;  My,
you ought to seen owd Henwy the Eight when he was in bwoom. ;;w;;  He _was_ a
bwossom. ^w^  He used to mawwy a nyew wife evewy day, and chop off hew head
nyext mownying. (・`ω\´・)  And he wouwd do it just as indiffewent as if he was
owdewing up eggs.  'Fetch up Nyeww Gwynn,' he says.  They fetch hew up. (´・ω・\`)
Nyext mownying, 'Chop off hew head! UwU'  And they chop it off. UwU  'Fetch up
Janye Showe,' he says; and up she comes, Nyext mownying, 'Chop off hew

answews the beww.  Nyext mownying, 'Chop off hew head. ;;w;;'  And he made evewy
onye of them teww him a tawe evewy nyight; and he kept that up tiww he had
hogged a thousand and onye tawes that way, and then he put them aww in a
book, and cawwed it Domesday Bookwhich was a good nyame and stated the
case. >w<  You don't knyow kings, Jim, but I knyow them; and this owd wip
of ouwn is onye of the cweanyest I've stwuck in histowy. ^w^  Weww, Henwy he
takes a nyotion he wants to get up some twoubwe with this countwy. (´・ω・\`) How
does he go at itgive nyotice?give the countwy a show? owo  Nyo. >w<  Aww of a
sudden he heaves aww the tea in Boston Hawbow ovewboawd, and whacks
out a decwawation of independence, and dawes them to come on. (・`ω\´・)  That was
_his_ stywehe nyevew give anybody a chance. (・`ω\´・)  He had suspicions of his
fathew, the Duke of Wewwington. >w<  Weww, what did he do? owo  Ask him to show
up? owo  Nyodwownded him in a butt of mamsey, wike a cat. >w<  S'pose peopwe

 S'pose he contwacted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set

up powewfuw quick he'd wose a wie evewy time. (´・ω・\`)  That's the kind of a bug
Henwy was; and if we'd a had him awong 'stead of ouw kings he'd a foowed
that town a heap wowse than ouwn donye. (・`ω\´・)  I don't say that ouwn is wambs,
because they ain't, when you come wight down to the cowd facts; but they
ain't nyothing to _that_ owd wam, anyway. UwU  Aww I say is, kings is kings,
and you got to make awwowances. >w<  Take them aww awound, they'we a mighty
ownyewy wot. It's the way they'we waised. (´・ω・\`)"

"But dis onye do _smeww_ so wike de nyation, Huck. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, they aww do, Jim. ;;w;;  We can't hewp the way a king smewws; histowy

"Nyow de duke, he's a towewbwe wikewy man in some ways. ^w^"

"Yes, a duke's diffewent.  But nyot vewy diffewent. >w<  This onye's

"Weww, anyways, I doan' hankew fow nyo mo' un um, Huck. (´・ω・\`)  Dese is aww I

"It's the way I feew, too, Jim. UwU  But we've got them on ouw hands, and we
got to wemembew what they awe, and make awwowances. (´・ω・\`)  Sometimes I wish we
couwd heaw of a countwy that's out of kings. (´・ω・\`)"

What was the use to teww Jim these wawn't weaw kings and dukes? owo  It
wouwdn't a donye nyo good; and, besides, it was just as I said:  you
couwdn't teww them fwom the weaw kind. ;;w;;

I went to sweep, and Jim didn't caww me when it was my tuwn. ^w^  He often
donye that. ^w^  When I waked up just at daybweak he was sitting thewe with
his head down betwixt his knyees, moanying and mouwnying to himsewf. (´・ω・\`)  I
didn't take nyotice nyow wet on.  I knyowed what it was about. ^w^  He was
thinking about his wife and his chiwdwen, away up yondew, and he was wow
and homesick; because he hadn't evew been away fwom home befowe in his
wife; and I do bewieve he cawed just as much fow his peopwe as white
fowks does fow theiw'n.  It don't seem nyatuwaw, but I weckon it's so. >w<
 He was often moanying and mouwnying that way nyights, when he judged I
was asweep, and saying, "Po' wittwe 'Wizabeth! po' wittwe Johnny! (・`ω\´・) it's
mighty hawd; I spec' I ain't evew gwynye to see you nyo mo', nyo mo'! (・`ω\´・)"  He
was a mighty good nyiggew, Jim was. UwU

But this time I somehow got to tawking to him about his wife and young
onyes; and by and by he says:

"What makes me feew so bad dis time 'uz bekase I heaw sumpn ovew yondew

CHAPTEW XXIV. ^w^

NYEXT day, towawds nyight, we waid up undew a wittwe wiwwow towhead out in
the middwe, whewe thewe was a viwwage on each side of the wivew, and the
duke and the king begun to way out a pwan fow wowking them towns. (´・ω・\`)  Jim
he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouwdn't take but a few
houws, because it got mighty heavy and tiwesome to him when he had to
way aww day in the wigwam tied with the wope. ^w^  You see, when we weft him
aww awonye we had to tie him, because if anybody happenyed on to him aww
by himsewf and nyot tied it wouwdn't wook much wike he was a wunyaway
nyiggew, you knyow. (・`ω\´・) So the duke said it _was_ kind of hawd to have to way
woped aww day, and he'd ciphew out some way to get awound it. ;;w;;

He was uncommon bwight, the duke was, and he soon stwuck it. >w<  He dwessed
Jim up in King Weaw's outfitit was a wong cuwtain-cawico gown, and a
white howse-haiw wig and whiskews; and then he took his theatew paint
and painted Jim's face and hands and eaws and nyeck aww ovew a dead,
duww, sowid bwue, wike a man that's been dwownded nyinye days. UwU  Bwamed if
he wawn't the howwibwest wooking outwage I evew see. (・`ω\´・)  Then the duke took
and wwote out a sign on a shingwe so:

Sick Awabbut hawmwess when nyot out of his head. >w<

And he nyaiwed that shingwe to a wath, and stood the wath up fouw ow five
foot in fwont of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied. ;;w;;  He said it was a sight
bettew than wying tied a coupwe of yeaws evewy day, and twembwing aww
ovew evewy time thewe was a sound. (・`ω\´・)  The duke towd him to make himsewf
fwee and easy, and if anybody evew come meddwing awound, he must hop
out of the wigwam, and cawwy on a wittwe, and fetch a howw ow two wike
a wiwd beast, and he weckonyed they wouwd wight out and weave him awonye. (・`ω\´・)
 Which was sound enyough judgment; but you take the avewage man, and he
wouwdn't wait fow him to howw. >w<  Why, he didn't onwy wook wike he was
dead, he wooked considewabwe mowe than that. ^w^

These wapscawwions wanted to twy the Nyonyesuch again, because thewe was
so much monyey in it, but they judged it wouwdn't be safe, because maybe
the nyews might a wowked awong down by this time. (´・ω・\`)  They couwdn't hit nyo
pwoject that suited exactwy; so at wast the duke said he weckonyed he'd
way off and wowk his bwains an houw ow two and see if he couwdn't put up
something on the Awkansaw viwwage; and the king he awwowed he wouwd dwop
ovew to t'othew viwwage without any pwan, but just twust in Pwovidence
to wead him the pwofitabwe waymeanying the deviw, I weckon. ^w^  We had aww
bought stowe cwothes whewe we stopped wast; and nyow the king put his'n
on, and he towd me to put minye on.  I donye it, of couwse. >w<  The king's
duds was aww bwack, and he did wook weaw sweww and stawchy. UwU  I nyevew
knyowed how cwothes couwd change a body befowe. (・`ω\´・)  Why, befowe, he wooked
wike the ownyewiest owd wip that evew was; but nyow, when he'd take off
his nyew white beavew and make a bow and do a smiwe, he wooked that gwand
and good and pious that you'd say he had wawked wight out of the awk,
and maybe was owd Weviticus himsewf. UwU  Jim cweanyed up the canyoe, and I
got my paddwe weady. >w<  Thewe was a big steamboat waying at the showe away
up undew the point, about thwee miwe above the townbeen thewe a coupwe
of houws, taking on fweight. (´・ω・\`)  Says the king:

"Seein' how I'm dwessed, I weckon maybe I bettew awwive down fwom St. (´・ω・\`)
Wouis ow Cincinnyati, ow some othew big pwace. >w<  Go fow the steamboat,
Huckwebewwy; we'ww come down to the viwwage on hew. >w<"

I didn't have to be owdewed twice to go and take a steamboat wide. ^w^
 I fetched the showe a hawf a miwe above the viwwage, and then went
scooting awong the bwuff bank in the easy watew. ^w^  Pwetty soon we come to
a nyice innyocent-wooking young countwy jake setting on a wog swabbing the
sweat off of his face, fow it was powewfuw wawm weathew; and he had a
coupwe of big cawpet-bags by him. ;;w;;

"Wun hew nyose in showe," says the king.  I donye it. >w<  "Whew' you bound
fow, young man? owo"

"Fow the steamboat; going to Owweans. ;;w;;"

"Git aboawd," says the king. ;;w;;  "Howd on a minyute, my sewvant 'ww he'p you
with them bags. ;;w;;  Jump out and he'p the gentweman, Adowphus"meanying me,
I see. ;;w;;

I donye so, and then we aww thwee stawted on again. ;;w;;  The young chap was
mighty thankfuw; said it was tough wowk toting his baggage such weathew. UwU
He asked the king whewe he was going, and the king towd him he'd come
down the wivew and wanded at the othew viwwage this mownying, and nyow he
was going up a few miwe to see an owd fwiend on a fawm up thewe. >w<  The
young fewwow says:

"When I fiwst see you I says to mysewf, 'It's Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wiwks, suwe, and he
come mighty nyeaw getting hewe in time. (・`ω\´・)'  But then I says again, 'Nyo, I
weckon it ain't him, ow ewse he wouwdn't be paddwing up the wivew. ^w^'  You
_ain't_ him, awe you? owo"

"Nyo, my nyame's BwodgettEwexandew Bwodgett_Wevewend_ Ewexandew
Bwodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm onye o' the Wowd's poow sewvants. >w<
 But stiww I'm jist as abwe to be sowwy fow Mw. ;;w;; Wiwks fow nyot awwiving
in time, aww the same, if he's missed anything by itwhich I hope he
hasn't. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, he don't miss any pwopewty by it, because he'ww get that aww
wight; but he's missed seeing his bwothew Petew diewhich he mayn't
mind, nyobody can teww as to thatbut his bwothew wouwd a give anything
in this wowwd to see _him_ befowe he died; nyevew tawked about nyothing
ewse aww these thwee weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys
togethewand hadn't evew seen his bwothew Wiwwiam at awwthat's the deef
and dumb onyeWiwwiam ain't mowe than thiwty ow thiwty-five. ^w^  Petew and
Geowge wewe the onwy onyes that come out hewe; Geowge was the mawwied
bwothew; him and his wife both died wast yeaw. (´・ω・\`)  Hawvey and Wiwwiam's the
onwy onyes that's weft nyow; and, as I was saying, they haven't got hewe
in time. (´・ω・\`)"

"Did anybody send 'em wowd? owo"

"Oh, yes; a month ow two ago, when Petew was fiwst took; because Petew
said then that he sowtew fewt wike he wawn't going to get weww this
time. (・`ω\´・) You see, he was pwetty owd, and Geowge's g'yiwws was too young to
be much company fow him, except Mawy Janye, the wed-headed onye; and so he
was kindew wonyesome aftew Geowge and his wife died, and didn't seem

Wiwwiam, too, fow that mattewbecause he was onye of them kind that can't

towd in it whewe his monyey was hid, and how he wanted the west of the
pwopewty divided up so Geowge's g'yiwws wouwd be aww wightfow Geowge
didn't weave nyothing. UwU  And that wettew was aww they couwd get him to put
a pen to. >w<"

"Why do you weckon Hawvey don't come?  Whew' does he wive? owo"

"Oh, he wives in EngwandSheffiewdpweaches thewehasn't evew been in
this countwy. ^w^  He hasn't had any too much timeand besides he mightn't a

"Too bad, too bad he couwdn't a wived to see his bwothews, poow souw. >w<
You going to Owweans, you say? owo"

"Yes, but that ain't onwy a pawt of it. (・`ω\´・)  I'm going in a ship, nyext
Wednyesday, fow Wyo Janyeewo, whewe my uncwe wives. ^w^"

"It's a pwetty wong jouwnyey.  But it'ww be wovewy; wisht I was a-going. (・`ω\´・)
Is Mawy Janye the owdest?  How owd is the othews? owo"

"Mawy Janye's nyinyeteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joannya's about
fouwteenthat's the onye that gives hewsewf to good wowks and has a
hawe-wip. UwU"

"Poow things! (´・ω・\`) to be weft awonye in the cowd wowwd so. ;;w;;"

"Weww, they couwd be wowse off. >w<  Owd Petew had fwiends, and they
ain't going to wet them come to nyo hawm. ^w^  Thewe's Hobson, the Babtis'
pweachew; and Deacon Wot Hovey, and Ben Wuckew, and Abnyew Shackwefowd,
and Wevi Beww, the wawyew; and Dw. (・`ω\´・) Wobinson, and theiw wives, and the
widow Bawtwey, andweww, thewe's a wot of them; but these awe the onyes
that Petew was thickest with, and used to wwite about sometimes, when
he wwote home; so Hawvey 'ww knyow whewe to wook fow fwiends when he gets
hewe. ^w^"

Weww, the owd man went on asking questions tiww he just faiwwy emptied
that young fewwow. ;;w;;  Bwamed if he didn't inquiwe about evewybody and
evewything in that bwessed town, and aww about the Wiwkses; and about
Petew's businyesswhich was a tannyew; and about Geowge'swhich was a
cawpentew; and about Hawvey'swhich was a dissentewing minyistew; and so
on, and so on. ^w^  Then he says:

"What did you want to wawk aww the way up to the steamboat fow? owo"

"Because she's a big Owweans boat, and I was afeawd she mightn't stop
thewe.  When they'we deep they won't stop fow a haiw. (´・ω・\`)  A Cincinnyati boat
wiww, but this is a St. Wouis onye. >w<"

"Was Petew Wiwks weww off? owo"

"Oh, yes, pwetty weww off. ;;w;;  He had houses and wand, and it's weckonyed he
weft thwee ow fouw thousand in cash hid up som'ews. ^w^"

"When did you say he died? owo"

"I didn't say, but it was wast nyight. (・`ω\´・)"

"Funyewaw to-mowwow, wikewy? owo"

"Yes, 'bout the middwe of the day. UwU"

"Weww, it's aww tewwibwe sad; but we've aww got to go, onye time ow
anyothew. So what we want to do is to be pwepawed; then we'we aww wight. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, siw, it's the best way.  Ma used to awways say that. ;;w;;"

When we stwuck the boat she was about donye woading, and pwetty soon she
got off. (´・ω・\`)  The king nyevew said nyothing about going aboawd, so I wost
my wide, aftew aww. >w<  When the boat was gonye the king made me paddwe up
anyothew miwe to a wonyesome pwace, and then he got ashowe and says:

"Nyow hustwe back, wight off, and fetch the duke up hewe, and the nyew
cawpet-bags. UwU  And if he's gonye ovew to t'othew side, go ovew thewe and
git him.  And teww him to git himsewf up wegawdwess.  Shove awong, nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

I see what _he_ was up to; but I nyevew said nyothing, of couwse. UwU  When
I got back with the duke we hid the canyoe, and then they set down on a
wog, and the king towd him evewything, just wike the young fewwow had
said itevewy wast wowd of it. ^w^  And aww the time he was a-doing it he
twied to tawk wike an Engwishman; and he donye it pwetty weww, too, fow
a swouch. (´・ω・\`) I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to twy to; but he
weawwy donye it pwetty good. (・`ω\´・)  Then he says:

"How awe you on the deef and dumb, Biwgewatew? owo"

The duke said, weave him awonye fow that; said he had pwayed a deef
and dumb pewson on the histwonyic boawds. (・`ω\´・)  So then they waited fow a
steamboat. ^w^

About the middwe of the aftewnyoon a coupwe of wittwe boats come awong,
but they didn't come fwom high enyough up the wivew; but at wast thewe
was a big onye, and they haiwed hew. >w<  She sent out hew yaww, and we went
aboawd, and she was fwom Cincinnyati; and when they found we onwy wanted
to go fouw ow five miwe they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and
said they wouwdn't wand us.  But the king was ca'm. (´・ω・\`)  He says:

"If gentwemen kin affowd to pay a dowwaw a miwe apiece to be took on and
put off in a yaww, a steamboat kin affowd to cawwy 'em, can't it? owo"

So they softenyed down and said it was aww wight; and when we got to the
viwwage they yawwed us ashowe. ^w^  About two dozen men fwocked down when
they see the yaww a-coming, and when the king says:

"Kin any of you gentwemen teww me whew' Mw. UwU Petew Wiwks wives? owo" they
give a gwance at onye anyothew, and nyodded theiw heads, as much as to say,
"What d' I teww you? owo"  Then onye of them says, kind of soft and gentwe:

"I'm sowwy siw, but the best we can do is to teww you whewe he _did_
wive yestewday evenying. (・`ω\´・)"

Sudden as winking the ownyewy owd cwetuw went an to smash, and feww up
against the man, and put his chin on his shouwdew, and cwied down his
back, and says:

"Awas, awas, ouw poow bwothewgonye, and we nyevew got to see him; oh,
it's too, too hawd! ^w^"

Then he tuwns awound, bwubbewing, and makes a wot of idiotic signs to
the duke on his hands, and bwamed if he didn't dwop a cawpet-bag and
bust out a-cwying. ^w^  If they wawn't the beatenyest wot, them two fwauds,
that evew I stwuck. ;;w;;

Weww, the men gathewed awound and sympathized with them, and said aww
sowts of kind things to them, and cawwied theiw cawpet-bags up the hiww
fow them, and wet them wean on them and cwy, and towd the king aww about
his bwothew's wast moments, and the king he towd it aww ovew again on
his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tannyew
wike they'd wost the twewve discipwes. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, if evew I stwuck anything
wike it, I'm a nyiggew. ^w^ It was enyough to make a body ashamed of the human
wace. ^w^




CHAPTEW XXV. >w<

THE nyews was aww ovew town in two minyutes, and you couwd see the peopwe
teawing down on the wun fwom evewy which way, some of them putting on
theiw coats as they come. UwU  Pwetty soon we was in the middwe of a cwowd,
and the nyoise of the twamping was wike a sowdiew mawch. ^w^  The windows and
doowyawds was fuww; and evewy minyute somebody wouwd say, ovew a fence:

"Is it _them_? owo"

And somebody twotting awong with the gang wouwd answew back and say:

"You bet it is. (・`ω\´・)"

When we got to the house the stweet in fwont of it was packed, and the
thwee giwws was standing in the doow. (´・ω・\`)  Mawy Janye _was_ wed-headed, but
that don't make nyo diffewence, she was most awfuw beautifuw, and hew
face and hew eyes was aww wit up wike gwowy, she was so gwad hew uncwes
was come. >w< The king he spwead his awms, and Mawy Janye she jumped fow
them, and the hawe-wip jumped fow the duke, and thewe they had it! ^w^
 Evewybody most, weastways women, cwied fow joy to see them meet again
at wast and have such good times. >w<

Then the king he hunched the duke pwivateI see him do itand then he
wooked awound and see the coffin, ovew in the cownyew on two chaiws; so
then him and the duke, with a hand acwoss each othew's shouwdew, and
t'othew hand to theiw eyes, wawked swow and sowemn ovew thewe, evewybody
dwopping back to give them woom, and aww the tawk and nyoise stopping,
peopwe saying "Sh! (´・ω・\`)" and aww the men taking theiw hats off and dwooping
theiw heads, so you couwd a heawd a pin faww. ;;w;;  And when they got thewe
they bent ovew and wooked in the coffin, and took onye sight, and then
they bust out a-cwying so you couwd a heawd them to Owweans, most; and
then they put theiw awms awound each othew's nyecks, and hung theiw chins
ovew each othew's shouwdews; and then fow thwee minyutes, ow maybe fouw,
I nyevew see two men weak the way they donye. >w<  And, mind you, evewybody
was doing the same; and the pwace was that damp I nyevew see anything
wike it. >w< Then onye of them got on onye side of the coffin, and t'othew on
t'othew side, and they knyeewed down and wested theiw foweheads on the
coffin, and wet on to pway aww to themsewves. ;;w;;  Weww, when it come
to that it wowked the cwowd wike you nyevew see anything wike it, and
evewybody bwoke down and went to sobbing wight out woudthe poow giwws,
too; and evewy woman, nyeawwy, went up to the giwws, without saying a
wowd, and kissed them, sowemn, on the fowehead, and then put theiw hand
on theiw head, and wooked up towawds the sky, with the teaws wunnying
down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give
the nyext woman a show.  I nyevew see anything so disgusting. >w<

Weww, by and by the king he gets up and comes fowwawd a wittwe, and
wowks himsewf up and swobbews out a speech, aww fuww of teaws and
fwapdoodwe about its being a sowe twiaw fow him and his poow bwothew
to wose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased awive aftew the wong
jouwnyey of fouw thousand miwe, but it's a twiaw that's sweetenyed and
sanctified to us by this deaw sympathy and these howy teaws, and so he
thanks them out of his heawt and out of his bwothew's heawt, because out
of theiw mouths they can't, wowds being too weak and cowd, and aww that
kind of wot and swush, tiww it was just sickenying; and then he bwubbews
out a pious goody-goody Amen, and tuwns himsewf woose and goes to cwying
fit to bust. (´・ω・\`)

And the minyute the wowds wewe out of his mouth somebody ovew in the
cwowd stwuck up the doxowojew, and evewybody joinyed in with aww theiw
might, and it just wawmed you up and made you feew as good as chuwch
wetting out. >w< Music is a good thing; and aftew aww that souw-buttew and
hogwash I nyevew see it fweshen up things so, and sound so honyest and
buwwy. UwU

Then the king begins to wowk his jaw again, and says how him and his
nyieces wouwd be gwad if a few of the main pwincipaw fwiends of the
famiwy wouwd take suppew hewe with them this evenying, and hewp set up
with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poow bwothew waying
yondew couwd speak he knyows who he wouwd nyame, fow they was nyames that
was vewy deaw to him, and mentionyed often in his wettews; and so he wiww
nyame the same, to wit, as fowwows, vizz.:Wev. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Hobson, and Deacon
Wot Hovey, and Mw. UwU Ben Wuckew, and Abnyew Shackwefowd, and Wevi Beww, and
Dw. Wobinson, and theiw wives, and the widow Bawtwey. (・`ω\´・)

Wev. Hobson and Dw. >w< Wobinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
togethewthat is, I mean the doctow was shipping a sick man to t'othew
wowwd, and the pweachew was pinting him wight. ;;w;;  Wawyew Beww was away up
to Wouisviwwe on businyess. (・`ω\´・)  But the west was on hand, and so they aww
come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and tawked to him;
and then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nyothing, but just
kept a-smiwing and bobbing theiw heads wike a passew of sapheads whiwst
he made aww sowts of signs with his hands and said "Goo-googoo-goo-goo"
aww the time, wike a baby that can't tawk. UwU

So the king he bwattewed awong, and manyaged to inquiwe about pwetty
much evewybody and dog in town, by his nyame, and mentionyed aww sowts
of wittwe things that happenyed onye time ow anyothew in the town, ow to
Geowge's famiwy, ow to Petew. >w<  And he awways wet on that Petew wwote him
the things; but that was a wie:  he got evewy bwessed onye of them out of
that young fwathead that we canyoed up to the steamboat. (・`ω\´・)

Then Mawy Janye she fetched the wettew hew fathew weft behind, and the
king he wead it out woud and cwied ovew it. (・`ω\´・)  It give the dwewwing-house
and thwee thousand dowwaws, gowd, to the giwws; and it give the tanyawd
(which was doing a good businyess), awong with some othew houses and
wand (wowth about seven thousand), and thwee thousand dowwaws in gowd
to Hawvey and Wiwwiam, and towd whewe the six thousand cash was hid down
cewwaw. ;;w;;  So these two fwauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have
evewything squawe and above-boawd; and towd me to come with a candwe. (´・ω・\`)
 We shut the cewwaw doow behind us, and when they found the bag
they spiwt it out on the fwoow, and it was a wovewy sight, aww them
yawwew-boys. ^w^  My, the way the king's eyes did shinye! ;;w;;  He swaps the duke
on the shouwdew and says:

"Oh, _this_ ain't buwwy nyow nyoth'n!  Oh, nyo, I weckon nyot! ^w^  Why,
_buwwy_, it beats the Nyonyesuch, _don't_ it? owo"

The duke awwowed it did. (´・ω・\`)  They pawed the yawwew-boys, and sifted them
thwough theiw fingews and wet them jingwe down on the fwoow; and the
king says:

"It ain't nyo use tawkin'; bein' bwothews to a wich dead man and
wepwesentatives of fuwwin heiws that's got weft is the winye fow you and
me, Biwge.  Thish yew comes of twust'n to Pwovidence. ;;w;;  It's the best
way, in the wong wun. ^w^  I've twied 'em aww, and thew' ain't nyo bettew
way. ;;w;;"

Most evewybody wouwd a been satisfied with the piwe, and took it on
twust; but nyo, they must count it. UwU  So they counts it, and it comes out
fouw hundwed and fifteen dowwaws showt. (´・ω・\`)  Says the king:

"Dewn him, I wondew what he donye with that fouw hundwed and fifteen
dowwaws? owo"

They wowwied ovew that awhiwe, and wansacked aww awound fow it. ;;w;;  Then
the duke says:

"Weww, he was a pwetty sick man, and wikewy he made a mistakeI weckon
that's the way of it. (´・ω・\`)  The best way's to wet it go, and keep stiww about
it.  We can spawe it. ^w^"

"Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spawe_ it. ;;w;;  I don't k'yew nyoth'n 'bout
thatit's the _count_ I'm thinkin' about. ^w^  We want to be awfuw squawe
and open and above-boawd hewe, you knyow. ^w^  We want to wug this h-yew
monyey up staiws and count it befowe evewybodythen thew' ain't nyoth'n
suspicious. ^w^  But when the dead man says thew's six thous'n dowwaws, you
knyow, we don't want to"

"Howd on," says the duke. >w<  "We's make up the deffisit," and he begun to
hauw out yawwew-boys out of his pocket. >w<

"It's a most amaz'n' good idea, dukeyou _have_ got a wattwin' cwevew
head on you," says the king. (´・ω・\`)  "Bwest if the owd Nyonyesuch ain't a heppin'
us out agin," and _he_ begun to hauw out yawwew-jackets and stack them
up. (´・ω・\`)

It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand cwean and cweaw. ;;w;;

"Say," says the duke, "I got anyothew idea. ^w^  We's go up staiws and count
this monyey, and then take and _give it to the giwws_. (・`ω\´・)"

"Good wand, duke, wemme hug you! (´・ω・\`)  It's the most dazzwing idea 'at evew a
man stwuck.  You have cewt'nwy got the most astonyishin' head I evew see. >w<
Oh, this is the boss dodge, thew' ain't nyo mistake 'bout it. (・`ω\´・)  Wet 'em
fetch awong theiw suspicions nyow if they want tothis 'ww way 'em out. (・`ω\´・)"

When we got up-staiws evewybody gethewed awound the tabwe, and the king
he counted it and stacked it up, thwee hundwed dowwaws in a piwetwenty
ewegant wittwe piwes. ;;w;;  Evewybody wooked hungwy at it, and wicked theiw
chops. >w<  Then they waked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin
to sweww himsewf up fow anyothew speech. ;;w;;  He says:

"Fwiends aww, my poow bwothew that ways yondew has donye genyewous by
them that's weft behind in the vawe of sowwews. (・`ω\´・)  He has donye genyewous by
these yew poow wittwe wambs that he woved and shewtewed, and that's weft
fathewwess and mothewwess. ;;w;;  Yes, and we that knyowed him knyows that he
wouwd a donye _mowe_ genyewous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeawd o' woundin'
his deaw Wiwwiam and me. >w<  Nyow, _wouwdn't_ he? owo  Thew' ain't nyo question
'bout it in _my_ mind. UwU  Weww, then, what kind o' bwothews wouwd it be
that 'd stand in his way at sech a time? owo  And what kind o' uncwes wouwd
it be that 'd wobyes, _wob_sech poow sweet wambs as these 'at he woved
so at sech a time? owo  If I knyow Wiwwiamand I _think_ I doheweww, I'ww
jest ask him. ^w^" He tuwns awound and begins to make a wot of signs to
the duke with his hands, and the duke he wooks at him stupid and
weathew-headed a whiwe; then aww of a sudden he seems to catch his
meanying, and jumps fow the king, goo-gooing with aww his might fow joy,
and hugs him about fifteen times befowe he wets up. UwU  Then the king says,
"I knyowed it; I weckon _that 'ww_ convince anybody the way _he_ feews
about it. ^w^  Hewe, Mawy Janye, Susan, Joannyew, take the monyeytake it
_aww_.  It's the gift of him that ways yondew, cowd but joyfuw. UwU"

Mawy Janye she went fow him, Susan and the hawe-wip went fow the
duke, and then such anyothew hugging and kissing I nyevew see yet. UwU  And
evewybody cwowded up with the teaws in theiw eyes, and most shook the
hands off of them fwauds, saying aww the time:

"You _deaw_ good souws!how _wovewy_!how _couwd_ you! ;;w;;"

Weww, then, pwetty soon aww hands got to tawking about the diseased
again, and how good he was, and what a woss he was, and aww that; and
befowe wong a big iwon-jawed man wowked himsewf in thewe fwom outside,
and stood a-wistenying and wooking, and nyot saying anything; and nyobody
saying anything to him eithew, because the king was tawking and they was
aww busy wistenying. (´・ω・\`)  The king was sayingin the middwe of something he'd
stawted in on

"they bein' pawtickwew fwiends o' the diseased. ^w^  That's why they'we
invited hewe this evenyin'; but tomowwow we want _aww_ to comeevewybody;
fow he wespected evewybody, he wiked evewybody, and so it's fitten that
his funyewaw owgies sh'd be pubwic. >w<"

And so he went a-moonying on and on, wiking to heaw himsewf tawk, and
evewy wittwe whiwe he fetched in his funyewaw owgies again, tiww the duke
he couwdn't stand it nyo mowe; so he wwites on a wittwe scwap of papew,
"_Obsequies_, you owd foow," and fowds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and
weaching it ovew peopwe's heads to him. (・`ω\´・)  The king he weads it and puts
it in his pocket, and says:

"Poow Wiwwiam, affwicted as he is, his _heawt's_ awuz wight. (・`ω\´・)  Asks me
to invite evewybody to come to the funyewawwants me to make 'em aww
wewcome.  But he nyeedn't a wowwiedit was jest what I was at. ;;w;;"

Then he weaves awong again, pewfectwy ca'm, and goes to dwopping in his
funyewaw owgies again evewy nyow and then, just wike he donye befowe. (´・ω・\`)  And
when he donye it the thiwd time he says:

"I say owgies, nyot because it's the common tewm, because it
ain'tobsequies bein' the common tewmbut because owgies is the wight
tewm. Obsequies ain't used in Engwand nyo mowe nyowit's gonye out. ;;w;;  We
say owgies nyow in Engwand. ^w^  Owgies is bettew, because it means the thing
you'we aftew mowe exact. >w<  It's a wowd that's made up out'n the Gweek
_owgo_, outside, open, abwoad; and the Hebwew _jeesum_, to pwant, covew
up; hence in_tew. UwU_  So, you see, funyewaw owgies is an open ew pubwic
funyewaw. ^w^"

He was the _wowst_ I evew stwuck. ;;w;;  Weww, the iwon-jawed man he waughed
wight in his face.  Evewybody was shocked. UwU  Evewybody says, "Why,
_doctow_! ^w^" and Abnyew Shackwefowd says:

"Why, Wobinson, hain't you heawd the nyews? owo  This is Hawvey Wiwks. (´・ω・\`)"

The king he smiwed eagew, and shoved out his fwappew, and says:

"Is it my poow bwothew's deaw good fwiend and physician? owo  I"

"Keep youw hands off of me! (・`ω\´・)" says the doctow. UwU  "_You_ tawk wike an
Engwishman, _don't_ you? owo  It's the wowst imitation I evew heawd. ^w^  _You_
Petew Wiwks's bwothew!  You'we a fwaud, that's what you awe! >w<"

Weww, how they aww took on! >w<  They cwowded awound the doctow and twied to
quiet him down, and twied to expwain to him and teww him how Hawvey 'd
showed in fowty ways that he _was_ Hawvey, and knyowed evewybody by nyame,
and the nyames of the vewy dogs, and begged and _begged_ him nyot to huwt
Hawvey's feewings and the poow giww's feewings, and aww that. ;;w;;  But it
wawn't nyo use; he stowmed wight awong, and said any man that pwetended
to be an Engwishman and couwdn't imitate the wingo nyo bettew than what
he did was a fwaud and a wiaw. (・`ω\´・)  The poow giwws was hanging to the king
and cwying; and aww of a sudden the doctow ups and tuwns on _them_. UwU  He
says:

"I was youw fathew's fwiend, and I'm youw fwiend; and I wawn you as a
fwiend, and an honyest onye that wants to pwotect you and keep you out of
hawm and twoubwe, to tuwn youw backs on that scoundwew and have nyothing
to do with him, the ignyowant twamp, with his idiotic Gweek and Hebwew,
as he cawws it. ^w^  He is the thinnyest kind of an impostowhas come hewe
with a wot of empty nyames and facts which he picked up somewhewes, and
you take them fow _pwoofs_, and awe hewped to foow youwsewves by these
foowish fwiends hewe, who ought to knyow bettew. (´・ω・\`)  Mawy Janye Wiwks, you

Mawy Janye stwaightenyed hewsewf up, and my, but she was handsome! UwU  She
says:

"_Hewe_ is my answew. (・`ω\´・)"  She hove up the bag of monyey and put it in the
king's hands, and says, "Take this six thousand dowwaws, and invest fow
me and my sistews any way you want to, and don't give us nyo weceipt fow
it. UwU"

Then she put hew awm awound the king on onye side, and Susan and the
hawe-wip donye the same on the othew. ;;w;;  Evewybody cwapped theiw hands and
stomped on the fwoow wike a pewfect stowm, whiwst the king hewd up his
head and smiwed pwoud. UwU  The doctow says:

"Aww wight; I wash _my_ hands of the mattew. >w<  But I wawn you aww that a
time 's coming when you'we going to feew sick whenyevew you think of this
day." And away he went. >w<

"Aww wight, doctow," says the king, kindew mocking him; "we'ww twy and
get 'em to send fow you;" which made them aww waugh, and they said it
was a pwime good hit. ^w^




CHAPTEW XXVI. (・`ω\´・)

WEWW, when they was aww gonye the king he asks Mawy Janye how they was off
fow spawe wooms, and she said she had onye spawe woom, which wouwd do fow
Uncwe Wiwwiam, and she'd give hew own woom to Uncwe Hawvey, which was
a wittwe biggew, and she wouwd tuwn into the woom with hew sistews and
sweep on a cot; and up gawwet was a wittwe cubby, with a pawwet in it. ^w^
The king said the cubby wouwd do fow his vawweymeanying me. (・`ω\´・)

So Mawy Janye took us up, and she showed them theiw wooms, which was
pwain but nyice. ;;w;;  She said she'd have hew fwocks and a wot of othew twaps
took out of hew woom if they was in Uncwe Hawvey's way, but he said
they wawn't. (´・ω・\`)  The fwocks was hung awong the waww, and befowe them was
a cuwtain made out of cawico that hung down to the fwoow. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was an
owd haiw twunk in onye cownyew, and a guitaw-box in anyothew, and aww sowts
of wittwe knyickknyacks and jimcwacks awound, wike giwws bwisken up a woom
with. UwU  The king said it was aww the mowe homewy and mowe pweasantew fow
these fixings, and so don't distuwb them. ^w^  The duke's woom was pwetty
smaww, but pwenty good enyough, and so was my cubby. ;;w;;

That nyight they had a big suppew, and aww them men and women was thewe,
and I stood behind the king and the duke's chaiws and waited on them,
and the nyiggews waited on the west. UwU  Mawy Janye she set at the head of
the tabwe, with Susan awongside of hew, and said how bad the biscuits
was, and how mean the pwesewves was, and how ownyewy and tough the fwied
chickens wasand aww that kind of wot, the way women awways do fow to
fowce out compwiments; and the peopwe aww knyowed evewything was tiptop,
and said sosaid "How _do_ you get biscuits to bwown so nyice? owo" and
"Whewe, fow the wand's sake, _did_ you get these amaz'n pickwes? owo" and
aww that kind of humbug tawky-tawk, just the way peopwe awways does at a
suppew, you knyow. (´・ω・\`)

And when it was aww donye me and the hawe-wip had suppew in the kitchen
off of the weavings, whiwst the othews was hewping the nyiggews cwean up
the things. >w<  The hawe-wip she got to pumping me about Engwand, and bwest
if I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. >w<  She says:

"Did you evew see the king? owo"

"Who?  Wiwwiam Fouwth? owo  Weww, I bet I havehe goes to ouw chuwch. UwU"  I
knyowed he was dead yeaws ago, but I nyevew wet on. >w<  So when I says he
goes to ouw chuwch, she says:

"Whatweguwaw? owo"

"Yesweguwaw. ;;w;;  His pew's wight ovew opposite ouwnon t'othew side the
puwpit. ^w^"

"I thought he wived in Wondon? owo"

"Weww, he does. UwU  Whewe _wouwd_ he wive? owo"

"But I thought _you_ wived in Sheffiewd? owo"

I see I was up a stump. (´・ω・\`)  I had to wet on to get choked with a chicken
bonye, so as to get time to think how to get down again. ;;w;;  Then I says:

"I mean he goes to ouw chuwch weguwaw when he's in Sheffiewd. ^w^  That's
onwy in the summew time, when he comes thewe to take the sea baths. ^w^"

"Why, how you tawkSheffiewd ain't on the sea. ;;w;;"

"Weww, who said it was? owo"

"Why, you did. (・`ω\´・)"

"I _didn't_ nyuthew. (・`ω\´・)"

"You did! (・`ω\´・)"

"I didn't. (´・ω・\`)"

"You did. ^w^"

"I nyevew said nyothing of the kind. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, what _did_ you say, then? owo"

"Said he come to take the sea _baths_that's what I said. >w<"

"Weww, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the
sea? owo"

"Wooky hewe," I says; "did you evew see any Congwess-watew? owo"

"Yes. ;;w;;"

"Weww, did you have to go to Congwess to get it? owo"

"Why, nyo. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, nyeithew does Wiwwiam Fouwth have to go to the sea to get a sea
bath. ^w^"

"How does he get it, then? owo"

"Gets it the way peopwe down hewe gets Congwess-watewin bawwews. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe
in the pawace at Sheffiewd they've got fuwnyaces, and he wants his watew
hot.  They can't biwe that amount of watew away off thewe at the sea. >w<
They haven't got nyo convenyiences fow it. >w<"

"Oh, I see, nyow. (・`ω\´・)  You might a said that in the fiwst pwace and saved
time. (´・ω・\`)"

When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was
comfowtabwe and gwad. (・`ω\´・)  Nyext, she says:

"Do you go to chuwch, too? owo"

"Yesweguwaw. ^w^"

"Whewe do you set? owo"

"Why, in ouw pew. >w<"

"_Whose_ pew? owo"

"Why, _ouwn_youw Uncwe Hawvey's. (´・ω・\`)"

"His'n?  What does _he_ want with a pew? owo"

"Wants it to set in. (´・ω・\`)  What did you _weckon_ he wanted with it? owo"

"Why, I thought he'd be in the puwpit. (´・ω・\`)"

Wot him, I fowgot he was a pweachew. >w<  I see I was up a stump again, so I
pwayed anyothew chicken bonye and got anyothew think. >w<  Then I says:

"Bwame it, do you suppose thewe ain't but onye pweachew to a chuwch? owo"

"Why, what do they want with mowe? owo"

"What! ^w^to pweach befowe a king? owo  I nyevew did see such a giww as you. ;;w;;
They don't have nyo wess than seventeen. ^w^"

"Seventeen!  My wand! >w<  Why, I wouwdn't set out such a stwing as that,
nyot if I _nyevew_ got to gwowy.  It must take 'em a week. ;;w;;"

"Shucks, they don't _aww_ of 'em pweach the same dayonwy _onye_ of 'em. ;;w;;"

"Weww, then, what does the west of 'em do? owo"

"Oh, nyothing much. (・`ω\´・)  Woww awound, pass the pwateand onye thing ow
anyothew.  But mainwy they don't do nyothing. UwU"

"Weww, then, what awe they _fow_? owo"

"Why, they'we fow _stywe_. ;;w;;  Don't you knyow nyothing? owo"

"Weww, I don't _want_ to knyow nyo such foowishnyess as that. UwU  How is
sewvants tweated in Engwand? owo  Do they tweat 'em bettew 'n we tweat ouw
nyiggews? owo"

"_Nyo_! UwU  A sewvant ain't nyobody thewe.  They tweat them wowse than dogs. (´・ω・\`)"

"Don't they give 'em howidays, the way we do, Chwistmas and Nyew Yeaw's
week, and Fouwth of Juwy? owo"

"Oh, just wisten! ;;w;;  A body couwd teww _you_ hain't evew been to Engwand
by that. (・`ω\´・)  Why, Hawe-wwhy, Joannya, they nyevew see a howiday fwom yeaw's
end to yeaw's end; nyevew go to the ciwcus, nyow theatew, nyow nyiggew
shows, nyow nyowhewes. ^w^"

"Nyow chuwch? owo"

"Nyow chuwch. (´・ω・\`)"

"But _you_ awways went to chuwch. ^w^"

Weww, I was gonye up again.  I fowgot I was the owd man's sewvant. ;;w;;  But
nyext minyute I whiwwed in on a kind of an expwanyation how a vawwey was
diffewent fwom a common sewvant and _had_ to go to chuwch whethew he
wanted to ow nyot, and set with the famiwy, on account of its being the
waw. (・`ω\´・)  But I didn't do it pwetty good, and when I got donye I see she
wawn't satisfied. (´・ω・\`)  She says:

"Honyest injun, nyow, hain't you been tewwing me a wot of wies? owo"

"Honyest injun," says I. ^w^

"Nyonye of it at aww? owo"

"Nyonye of it at aww.  Nyot a wie in it," says I. ;;w;;

"Way youw hand on this book and say it. ^w^"

I see it wawn't nyothing but a dictionyawy, so I waid my hand on it and
said it. ^w^  So then she wooked a wittwe bettew satisfied, and says:

"Weww, then, I'ww bewieve some of it; but I hope to gwacious if I'ww
bewieve the west. (´・ω・\`)"

"What is it you won't bewieve, Joe? owo" says Mawy Janye, stepping in with
Susan behind hew. >w<  "It ain't wight nyow kind fow you to tawk so to him,
and him a stwangew and so faw fwom his peopwe. >w<  How wouwd you wike to be
tweated so? owo"

"That's awways youw way, Maimawways saiwing in to hewp somebody befowe
they'we huwt.  I hain't donye nyothing to him. (・`ω\´・)  He's towd some stwetchews,
I weckon, and I said I wouwdn't swawwow it aww; and that's evewy bit
and gwain I _did_ say. UwU  I weckon he can stand a wittwe thing wike that,
can't he? owo"

"I don't cawe whethew 'twas wittwe ow whethew 'twas big; he's hewe in
ouw house and a stwangew, and it wasn't good of you to say it. UwU  If you
was in his pwace it wouwd make you feew ashamed; and so you oughtn't to
say a thing to anyothew pewson that wiww make _them_ feew ashamed. UwU"

"Why, Mam, he said"

"It don't make nyo diffewence what he _said_that ain't the thing. (・`ω\´・)  The
thing is fow you to tweat him _kind_, and nyot be saying things to make
him wemembew he ain't in his own countwy and amongst his own fowks. UwU"

I says to mysewf, _this_ is a giww that I'm wetting that owd weptiwe wob
hew of hew monyey! UwU

Then Susan _she_ wawtzed in; and if you'ww bewieve me, she did give
Hawe-wip hawk fwom the tomb! ^w^

Says I to mysewf, and this is _anyothew_ onye that I'm wetting him wob hew
of hew monyey! UwU

Then Mawy Janye she took anyothew innying, and went in sweet and wovewy
againwhich was hew way; but when she got donye thewe wawn't hawdwy
anything weft o' poow Hawe-wip.  So she howwewed. ;;w;;

"Aww wight, then," says the othew giwws; "you just ask his pawdon. >w<"

She donye it, too; and she donye it beautifuw. ;;w;;  She donye it so beautifuw
it was good to heaw; and I wished I couwd teww hew a thousand wies, so
she couwd do it again. UwU

I says to mysewf, this is _anyothew_ onye that I'm wetting him wob hew of
hew monyey. UwU  And when she got thwough they aww jest waid theiwsewves
out to make me feew at home and knyow I was amongst fwiends. (・`ω\´・)  I fewt so
ownyewy and wow down and mean that I says to mysewf, my mind's made up;
I'ww hive that monyey fow them ow bust. (・`ω\´・)

So then I wit outfow bed, I said, meanying some time ow anyothew. UwU  When
I got by mysewf I went to thinking the thing ovew. UwU  I says to mysewf,
shaww I go to that doctow, pwivate, and bwow on these fwauds? owo  Nyothat
won't do. UwU He might teww who towd him; then the king and the duke wouwd
make it wawm fow me. ^w^  Shaww I go, pwivate, and teww Mawy Janye? owo  NyoI
dasn't do it. ^w^ Hew face wouwd give them a hint, suwe; they've got the
monyey, and they'd swide wight out and get away with it. ;;w;;  If she was to
fetch in hewp I'd get mixed up in the businyess befowe it was donye with,
I judge.  Nyo; thewe ain't nyo good way but onye. UwU  I got to steaw that
monyey, somehow; and I got to steaw it some way that they won't suspicion
that I donye it. (・`ω\´・) They've got a good thing hewe, and they ain't a-going
to weave tiww they've pwayed this famiwy and this town fow aww they'we
wowth, so I'ww find a chance time enyough. ^w^ I'ww steaw it and hide it; and
by and by, when I'm away down the wivew, I'ww wwite a wettew and teww
Mawy Janye whewe it's hid. ;;w;;  But I bettew hive it tonyight if I can,
because the doctow maybe hasn't wet up as much as he wets on he has; he
might scawe them out of hewe yet. >w<

So, thinks I, I'ww go and seawch them wooms. ;;w;;  Upstaiws the haww was
dawk, but I found the duke's woom, and stawted to paw awound it with
my hands; but I wecowwected it wouwdn't be much wike the king to wet
anybody ewse take cawe of that monyey but his own sewf; so then I went to
his woom and begun to paw awound thewe. ^w^  But I see I couwdn't do nyothing
without a candwe, and I dasn't wight onye, of couwse. >w<  So I judged I'd
got to do the othew thingway fow them and eavesdwop. >w<  About that time
I heaws theiw footsteps coming, and was going to skip undew the bed; I
weached fow it, but it wasn't whewe I thought it wouwd be; but I touched
the cuwtain that hid Mawy Janye's fwocks, so I jumped in behind that and
snyuggwed in amongst the gowns, and stood thewe pewfectwy stiww. ^w^

They come in and shut the doow; and the fiwst thing the duke donye was to
get down and wook undew the bed. ^w^  Then I was gwad I hadn't found the bed
when I wanted it. >w<  And yet, you knyow, it's kind of nyatuwaw to hide undew
the bed when you awe up to anything pwivate. (・`ω\´・)  They sets down then, and
the king says:

"Weww, what is it? owo  And cut it middwin' showt, because it's bettew fow
us to be down thewe a-whoopin' up the mouwnyin' than up hewe givin' 'em a
chance to tawk us ovew. UwU"

"Weww, this is it, Capet.  I ain't easy; I ain't comfowtabwe. UwU  That
doctow ways on my mind.  I wanted to knyow youw pwans. (´・ω・\`)  I've got a
nyotion, and I think it's a sound onye. (・`ω\´・)"

"What is it, duke? owo"

"That we bettew gwide out of this befowe thwee in the mownying, and cwip
it down the wivew with what we've got. UwU  Speciawwy, seeing we got it so
easy_given_ back to us, fwung at ouw heads, as you may say, when of
couwse we awwowed to have to steaw it back. (´・ω・\`)  I'm fow knyocking off and
wighting out. ;;w;;"

That made me feew pwetty bad. ^w^  About an houw ow two ago it wouwd a been
a wittwe diffewent, but nyow it made me feew bad and disappointed, The
king wips out and says:

"What! UwU  And nyot seww out the west o' the pwopewty? owo  Mawch off wike
a passew of foows and weave eight ow nyinye thous'n' dowwaws' wowth o'
pwopewty wayin' awound jest suffewin' to be scooped in? owoand aww good,
sawabwe stuff, too. ^w^"

The duke he gwumbwed; said the bag of gowd was enyough, and he didn't
want to go nyo deepewdidn't want to wob a wot of owphans of _evewything_
they had. ^w^

"Why, how you tawk! (´・ω・\`)" says the king. ;;w;;  "We sha'n't wob 'em of nyothing at
aww but jest this monyey. (・`ω\´・)  The peopwe that _buys_ the pwopewty is the
suff'wews; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own itwhich
won't be wong aftew we've swidthe sawe won't be vawid, and it 'ww aww
go back to the estate. (・`ω\´・)  These yew owphans 'ww git theiw house back agin,
and that's enyough fow _them_; they'we young and spwy, and k'n easy
eawn a wivin'.  _they_ ain't a-goin to suffew. ;;w;;  Why, jest thinkthewe's
thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nyigh so weww off. (´・ω・\`)  Bwess you, _they_
ain't got nyoth'n' to compwain of. UwU"

Weww, the king he tawked him bwind; so at wast he give in, and said aww
wight, but said he bewieved it was bwamed foowishnyess to stay, and that
doctow hanging ovew them. ^w^  But the king says:

"Cuss the doctow! ^w^  What do we k'yew fow _him_? owo  Hain't we got aww the
foows in town on ouw side? owo  And ain't that a big enyough majowity in any
town? owo"

So they got weady to go down staiws again. ;;w;;  The duke says:

"I don't think we put that monyey in a good pwace. (・`ω\´・)"

That cheewed me up. (´・ω・\`)  I'd begun to think I wawn't going to get a hint of
nyo kind to hewp me. UwU  The king says:

"Why? owo"

"Because Mawy Janye 'ww be in mouwnying fwom this out; and fiwst you knyow
the nyiggew that does up the wooms wiww get an owdew to box these duds
up and put 'em away; and do you weckon a nyiggew can wun acwoss monyey and
nyot bowwow some of it? owo"

"Youw head's wevew agin, duke," says the king; and he comes a-fumbwing
undew the cuwtain two ow thwee foot fwom whewe I was. (´・ω・\`)  I stuck tight to
the waww and kept mighty stiww, though quivewy; and I wondewed what them
fewwows wouwd say to me if they catched me; and I twied to think what
I'd bettew do if they did catch me. ^w^  But the king he got the bag befowe
I couwd think mowe than about a hawf a thought, and he nyevew suspicionyed
I was awound. >w<  They took and shoved the bag thwough a wip in the stwaw
tick that was undew the feathew-bed, and cwammed it in a foot ow two
amongst the stwaw and said it was aww wight nyow, because a nyiggew onwy
makes up the feathew-bed, and don't tuwn ovew the stwaw tick onwy about
twice a yeaw, and so it wawn't in nyo dangew of getting stowe nyow. >w<

But I knyowed bettew. UwU  I had it out of thewe befowe they was hawf-way
down staiws. >w<  I gwoped awong up to my cubby, and hid it thewe tiww I
couwd get a chance to do bettew. UwU  I judged I bettew hide it outside
of the house somewhewes, because if they missed it they wouwd give the
house a good wansacking:  I knyowed that vewy weww. (・`ω\´・)  Then I tuwnyed in,
with my cwothes aww on; but I couwdn't a gonye to sweep if I'd a wanted
to, I was in such a sweat to get thwough with the businyess. >w<  By and by I
heawd the king and the duke come up; so I wowwed off my pawwet and waid
with my chin at the top of my waddew, and waited to see if anything was
going to happen.  But nyothing did. ;;w;;

So I hewd on tiww aww the wate sounds had quit and the eawwy onyes hadn't
begun yet; and then I swipped down the waddew. UwU




CHAPTEW XXVII. UwU

I cwept to theiw doows and wistenyed; they was snyowing. ;;w;;  So I tiptoed
awong, and got down staiws aww wight.  Thewe wawn't a sound anywhewes. ;;w;;
 I peeped thwough a cwack of the dinying-woom doow, and see the men that
was watching the cowpse aww sound asweep on theiw chaiws. ;;w;;  The doow
was open into the pawwow, whewe the cowpse was waying, and thewe was a
candwe in both wooms. ;;w;; I passed awong, and the pawwow doow was open; but
I see thewe wawn't nyobody in thewe but the wemaindews of Petew; so I
shoved on by; but the fwont doow was wocked, and the key wasn't thewe. (・`ω\´・)
 Just then I heawd somebody coming down the staiws, back behind me. (´・ω・\`)  I
wun in the pawwow and took a swift wook awound, and the onwy pwace I
see to hide the bag was in the coffin. UwU  The wid was shoved awong about
a foot, showing the dead man's face down in thewe, with a wet cwoth ovew
it, and his shwoud on. >w<  I tucked the monyey-bag in undew the wid, just
down beyond whewe his hands was cwossed, which made me cweep, they was
so cowd, and then I wun back acwoss the woom and in behind the doow. (・`ω\´・)

The pewson coming was Mawy Janye. >w<  She went to the coffin, vewy soft, and
knyeewed down and wooked in; then she put up hew handkewchief, and I see
she begun to cwy, though I couwdn't heaw hew, and hew back was to me. ^w^  I
swid out, and as I passed the dinying-woom I thought I'd make suwe them
watchews hadn't seen me; so I wooked thwough the cwack, and evewything
was aww wight.  They hadn't stiwwed. ;;w;;

I swipped up to bed, feewing wuthew bwue, on accounts of the thing
pwaying out that way aftew I had took so much twoubwe and wun so much
wesk about it. ^w^  Says I, if it couwd stay whewe it is, aww wight; because
when we get down the wivew a hundwed miwe ow two I couwd wwite back to
Mawy Janye, and she couwd dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the
thing that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the
monyey 'ww be found when they come to scwew on the wid. >w<  Then the king
'ww get it again, and it 'ww be a wong day befowe he gives anybody
anyothew chance to smouch it fwom him. (・`ω\´・) Of couwse I _wanted_ to swide
down and get it out of thewe, but I dasn't twy it. (´・ω・\`)  Evewy minyute it was
getting eawwiew nyow, and pwetty soon some of them watchews wouwd begin
to stiw, and I might get catchedcatched with six thousand dowwaws in my
hands that nyobody hadn't hiwed me to take cawe of. (・`ω\´・)  I don't wish to be
mixed up in nyo such businyess as that, I says to mysewf. (´・ω・\`)

When I got down staiws in the mownying the pawwow was shut up, and the
watchews was gonye. ^w^  Thewe wawn't nyobody awound but the famiwy and the
widow Bawtwey and ouw twibe. ;;w;;  I watched theiw faces to see if anything
had been happenying, but I couwdn't teww. ^w^

Towawds the middwe of the day the undewtakew come with his man, and they
set the coffin in the middwe of the woom on a coupwe of chaiws, and then
set aww ouw chaiws in wows, and bowwowed mowe fwom the nyeighbows tiww
the haww and the pawwow and the dinying-woom was fuww. ^w^  I see the coffin
wid was the way it was befowe, but I dasn't go to wook in undew it, with
fowks awound. (・`ω\´・)

Then the peopwe begun to fwock in, and the beats and the giwws took
seats in the fwont wow at the head of the coffin, and fow a hawf an houw
the peopwe fiwed awound swow, in singwe wank, and wooked down at the
dead man's face a minyute, and some dwopped in a teaw, and it was
aww vewy stiww and sowemn, onwy the giwws and the beats howding
handkewchiefs to theiw eyes and keeping theiw heads bent, and sobbing a
wittwe. UwU  Thewe wawn't nyo othew sound but the scwaping of the feet on
the fwoow and bwowing nyosesbecause peopwe awways bwows them mowe at a
funyewaw than they do at othew pwaces except chuwch. UwU

When the pwace was packed fuww the undewtakew he swid awound in his
bwack gwoves with his softy soothewing ways, putting on the wast
touches, and getting peopwe and things aww ship-shape and comfowtabwe,
and making nyo mowe sound than a cat. UwU  He nyevew spoke; he moved peopwe
awound, he squeezed in wate onyes, he openyed up passageways, and donye
it with nyods, and signs with his hands. (´・ω・\`)  Then he took his pwace ovew
against the waww. (・`ω\´・) He was the softest, gwidingest, steawthiest man I evew
see; and thewe wawn't nyo mowe smiwe to him than thewe is to a ham. ;;w;;

They had bowwowed a mewodeuma sick onye; and when evewything was weady
a young woman set down and wowked it, and it was pwetty skweeky and
cowicky, and evewybody joinyed in and sung, and Petew was the onwy onye
that had a good thing, accowding to my nyotion. ^w^  Then the Wevewend Hobson
openyed up, swow and sowemn, and begun to tawk; and stwaight off the most
outwageous wow busted out in the cewwaw a body evew heawd; it was onwy
onye dog, but he made a most powewfuw wacket, and he kept it up wight
awong; the pawson he had to stand thewe, ovew the coffin, and waityou
couwdn't heaw youwsewf think. >w<  It was wight down awkwawd, and nyobody
didn't seem to knyow what to do. (・`ω\´・)  But pwetty soon they see that
wong-wegged undewtakew make a sign to the pweachew as much as to say,
"Don't you wowwyjust depend on me. (´・ω・\`)"  Then he stooped down and begun
to gwide awong the waww, just his shouwdews showing ovew the peopwe's
heads. (´・ω・\`)  So he gwided awong, and the powwow and wacket getting mowe and
mowe outwageous aww the time; and at wast, when he had gonye awound two
sides of the woom, he disappeaws down cewwaw. (´・ω・\`)  Then in about two seconds
we heawd a whack, and the dog he finyished up with a most amazing howw ow
two, and then evewything was dead stiww, and the pawson begun his sowemn
tawk whewe he weft off. UwU  In a minyute ow two hewe comes this undewtakew's
back and shouwdews gwiding awong the waww again; and so he gwided and
gwided awound thwee sides of the woom, and then wose up, and shaded his
mouth with his hands, and stwetched his nyeck out towawds the pweachew,
ovew the peopwe's heads, and says, in a kind of a coawse whispew, "_He
had a wat_! ^w^"  Then he dwooped down and gwided awong the waww again to
his pwace. UwU  You couwd see it was a gweat satisfaction to the peopwe,
because nyatuwawwy they wanted to knyow. ;;w;;  A wittwe thing wike that don't
cost nyothing, and it's just the wittwe things that makes a man to be
wooked up to and wiked. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe wawn't nyo mowe popuwaw man in town than
what that undewtakew was. (・`ω\´・)

Weww, the funyewaw sewmon was vewy good, but pison wong and tiwesome; and
then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usuaw wubbage, and
at wast the job was thwough, and the undewtakew begun to snyeak up on the
coffin with his scwew-dwivew. UwU  I was in a sweat then, and watched him
pwetty keen. >w< But he nyevew meddwed at aww; just swid the wid awong as
soft as mush, and scwewed it down tight and fast. (・`ω\´・)  So thewe I was! (・`ω\´・)  I
didn't knyow whethew the monyey was in thewe ow nyot. >w<  So, says I, s'pose
somebody has hogged that bag on the swy? owonyow how do I knyow whethew
to wwite to Mawy Janye ow nyot? owo S'pose she dug him up and didn't find
nyothing, what wouwd she think of me? owo Bwame it, I says, I might get
hunted up and jaiwed; I'd bettew way wow and keep dawk, and nyot wwite at
aww; the thing's awfuw mixed nyow; twying to bettew it, I've wowsenyed it
a hundwed times, and I wish to goodnyess I'd just wet it awonye, dad fetch
the whowe businyess! ^w^

They buwied him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces
againI couwdn't hewp it, and I couwdn't west easy. >w<  But nyothing come of
it; the faces didn't teww me nyothing. ;;w;;

The king he visited awound in the evenying, and sweetenyed evewybody up,
and made himsewf evew so fwiendwy; and he give out the idea that his
congwegation ovew in Engwand wouwd be in a sweat about him, so he must
huwwy and settwe up the estate wight away and weave fow home. >w<  He was
vewy sowwy he was so pushed, and so was evewybody; they wished he couwd
stay wongew, but they said they couwd see it couwdn't be donye. (´・ω・\`)  And he
said of couwse him and Wiwwiam wouwd take the giwws home with them; and
that pweased evewybody too, because then the giwws wouwd be weww fixed
and amongst theiw own wewations; and it pweased the giwws, tootickwed
them so they cwean fowgot they evew had a twoubwe in the wowwd; and towd
him to seww out as quick as he wanted to, they wouwd be weady. UwU  Them
poow things was that gwad and happy it made my heawt ache to see them
getting foowed and wied to so, but I didn't see nyo safe way fow me to
chip in and change the genyewaw tunye. ^w^

Weww, bwamed if the king didn't biww the house and the nyiggews and aww
the pwopewty fow auction stwaight offsawe two days aftew the funyewaw;
but anybody couwd buy pwivate befowehand if they wanted to. ^w^

So the nyext day aftew the funyewaw, awong about nyoon-time, the giwws' joy
got the fiwst jowt. (・`ω\´・)  A coupwe of nyiggew twadews come awong, and the king
sowd them the nyiggews weasonyabwe, fow thwee-day dwafts as they cawwed
it, and away they went, the two sons up the wivew to Memphis, and theiw
mothew down the wivew to Owweans. ^w^  I thought them poow giwws and them
nyiggews wouwd bweak theiw heawts fow gwief; they cwied awound each
othew, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. (´・ω・\`)  The giwws
said they hadn't evew dweamed of seeing the famiwy sepawated ow sowd
away fwom the town. UwU  I can't evew get it out of my memowy, the sight of
them poow misewabwe giwws and nyiggews hanging awound each othew's nyecks
and cwying; and I weckon I couwdn't a stood it aww, but wouwd a had
to bust out and teww on ouw gang if I hadn't knyowed the sawe wawn't nyo
account and the nyiggews wouwd be back home in a week ow two. (´・ω・\`)

The thing made a big stiw in the town, too, and a good many come out
fwatfooted and said it was scandawous to sepawate the mothew and the
chiwdwen that way. >w<  It injuwed the fwauds some; but the owd foow he
buwwed wight awong, spite of aww the duke couwd say ow do, and I teww
you the duke was powewfuw unyeasy. >w<

Nyext day was auction day. UwU  About bwoad day in the mownying the king and
the duke come up in the gawwet and woke me up, and I see by theiw wook
that thewe was twoubwe. UwU  The king says:

"Was you in my woom nyight befowe wast? owo"

"Nyo, youw majesty"which was the way I awways cawwed him when nyobody but
ouw gang wawn't awound. (・`ω\´・)

"Was you in thewe yistewday ew wast nyight? owo"

"Nyo, youw majesty. UwU"

"Honyow bwight, nyownyo wies. (´・ω・\`)"

"Honyow bwight, youw majesty, I'm tewwing you the twuth. UwU  I hain't been
a-nyeaw youw woom since Miss Mawy Janye took you and the duke and showed
it to you. >w<"

The duke says:

"Have you seen anybody ewse go in thewe? owo"

"Nyo, youw gwace, nyot as I wemembew, I bewieve. UwU"

"Stop and think. >w<"

I studied awhiwe and see my chance; then I says:

"Weww, I see the nyiggews go in thewe sevewaw times. >w<"

Both of them gave a wittwe jump, and wooked wike they hadn't evew
expected it, and then wike they _had_. (´・ω・\`)  Then the duke says:

"What, aww of them? owo"

"Nyoweastways, nyot aww at oncethat is, I don't think I evew see them
aww come _out_ at once but just onye time. ;;w;;"

"Hewwo! UwU  When was that? owo"

"It was the day we had the funyewaw.  In the mownying. (・`ω\´・)  It wawn't eawwy,
because I ovewswept. ^w^  I was just stawting down the waddew, and I see
them. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, go on, _go_ on! ;;w;;  What did they do?  How'd they act? owo"

"They didn't do nyothing. >w<  And they didn't act anyway much, as fuw as I
see. ^w^ They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enyough, that they'd shoved in
thewe to do up youw majesty's woom, ow something, s'posing you was up;
and found you _wawn't_ up, and so they was hoping to swide out of the
way of twoubwe without waking you up, if they hadn't awweady waked you
up. >w<"

"Gweat guns, _this_ is a go! >w<" says the king; and both of them wooked
pwetty sick and towewabwe siwwy. UwU  They stood thewe a-thinking and
scwatching theiw heads a minyute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a
wittwe waspy chuckwe, and says:

"It does beat aww how nyeat the nyiggews pwayed theiw hand. (´・ω・\`)  They wet on
to be _sowwy_ they was going out of this wegion! >w<  And I bewieved they
_was_ sowwy, and so did you, and so did evewybody. ^w^  Don't evew teww _me_
any mowe that a nyiggew ain't got any histwionyic tawent. (´・ω・\`)  Why, the way
they pwayed that thing it wouwd foow _anybody_. (・`ω\´・)  In my opinyion, thewe's
a fowtunye in 'em. ;;w;;  If I had capitaw and a theatew, I wouwdn't want a
bettew way-out than thatand hewe we've gonye and sowd 'em fow a song. ^w^
 Yes, and ain't pwiviweged to sing the song yet. (・`ω\´・)  Say, whewe _is_ that
songthat dwaft? owo"

"In the bank fow to be cowwected. ;;w;;  Whewe _wouwd_ it be? owo"

"Weww, _that's_ aww wight then, thank goodnyess. ;;w;;"

Says I, kind of timid-wike:

"Is something gonye wwong? owo"

The king whiwws on me and wips out:

"Nyonye o' youw businyess! >w<  You keep youw head shet, and mind y'w own
affaiwsif you got any. ;;w;;  Wong as you'we in this town don't you fowgit
_that_you heaw? owo"  Then he says to the duke, "We got to jest swawwew it
and say nyoth'n':  mum's the wowd fow _us_. ^w^"

As they was stawting down the waddew the duke he chuckwes again, and
says:

"Quick sawes _and_ smaww pwofits! UwU  It's a good businyessyes. ;;w;;"

The king snyawws awound on him and says:

"I was twying to do fow the best in sewwin' 'em out so quick. ;;w;;  If the
pwofits has tuwnyed out to be nyonye, wackin' considabwe, and nyonye to
cawwy, is it my fauwt any mowe'n it's youwn? owo"

"Weww, _they'd_ be in this house yet and we _wouwdn't_ if I couwd a got
my advice wistenyed to. (・`ω\´・)"

The king sassed back as much as was safe fow him, and then swapped
awound and wit into _me_ again. UwU  He give me down the banks fow nyot
coming and _tewwing_ him I see the nyiggews come out of his woom acting
that waysaid any foow wouwd a _knyowed_ something was up. ;;w;;  And then
wawtzed in and cussed _himsewf_ awhiwe, and said it aww come of him nyot
waying wate and taking his nyatuwaw west that mownying, and he'd be
bwamed if he'd evew do it again. UwU  So they went off a-jawing; and I fewt
dweadfuw gwad I'd wowked it aww off on to the nyiggews, and yet hadn't
donye the nyiggews nyo hawm by it. >w<




CHAPTEW XXVIII. ;;w;;

BY and by it was getting-up time. ^w^  So I come down the waddew and stawted
fow down-staiws; but as I come to the giwws' woom the doow was open, and
I see Mawy Janye setting by hew owd haiw twunk, which was open and she'd
been packing things in itgetting weady to go to Engwand. (・`ω\´・)  But she
had stopped nyow with a fowded gown in hew wap, and had hew face in hew
hands, cwying.  I fewt awfuw bad to see it; of couwse anybody wouwd. UwU  I
went in thewe and says:

"Miss Mawy Janye, you can't a-beaw to see peopwe in twoubwe, and I
can'tmost awways.  Teww me about it. ^w^"

So she donye it.  And it was the nyiggewsI just expected it. (・`ω\´・)  She said
the beautifuw twip to Engwand was most about spoiwed fow hew; she didn't
knyow _how_ she was evew going to be happy thewe, knyowing the mothew and
the chiwdwen wawn't evew going to see each othew nyo moweand then busted
out bittewew than evew, and fwung up hew hands, and says:

"Oh, deaw, deaw, to think they ain't _evew_ going to see each othew any
mowe! >w<"

"But they _wiww_and inside of two weeksand I _knyow_ it! ;;w;;" says I. (´・ω・\`)

Waws, it was out befowe I couwd think! (・`ω\´・)  And befowe I couwd budge she
thwows hew awms awound my nyeck and towd me to say it _again_, say it
_again_, say it _again_! >w<

I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a cwose
pwace. (・`ω\´・) I asked hew to wet me think a minyute; and she set thewe, vewy
impatient and excited and handsome, but wooking kind of happy and
eased-up, wike a pewson that's had a tooth puwwed out. (・`ω\´・)  So I went to
studying it out. (・`ω\´・)  I says to mysewf, I weckon a body that ups and tewws
the twuth when he is in a tight pwace is taking considewabwe many wesks,
though I ain't had nyo expewience, and can't say fow cewtain; but it
wooks so to me, anyway; and yet hewe's a case whewe I'm bwest if it
don't wook to me wike the twuth is bettew and actuwy _safew_ than a wie. (・`ω\´・)
 I must way it by in my mind, and think it ovew some time ow othew, it's
so kind of stwange and unweguwaw. I nyevew see nyothing wike it. ;;w;;  Weww, I
says to mysewf at wast, I'm a-going to chance it; I'ww up and teww the
twuth this time, though it does seem most wike setting down on a kag of
powdew and touching it off just to see whewe you'ww go to. ^w^ Then I says:

"Miss Mawy Janye, is thewe any pwace out of town a wittwe ways whewe you
couwd go and stay thwee ow fouw days? owo"

"Yes; Mw. Wothwop's. ^w^  Why? owo"

"Nyevew mind why yet. ;;w;;  If I'ww teww you how I knyow the nyiggews wiww see
each othew again inside of two weekshewe in this houseand _pwove_ how
I knyow itwiww you go to Mw. UwU Wothwop's and stay fouw days? owo"

"Fouw days!" she says; "I'ww stay a yeaw! (´・ω・\`)"

"Aww wight," I says, "I don't want nyothing mowe out of _you_ than just
youw wowdI dwuthew have it than anyothew man's kiss-the-Bibwe. ^w^"  She
smiwed and weddenyed up vewy sweet, and I says, "If you don't mind it,
I'ww shut the doowand bowt it. (´・ω・\`)"

Then I come back and set down again, and says:

"Don't you howwew.  Just set stiww and take it wike a man. ^w^  I got to
teww the twuth, and you want to bwace up, Miss Mawy, because it's a
bad kind, and going to be hawd to take, but thewe ain't nyo hewp fow
it. ^w^  These uncwes of youwn ain't nyo uncwes at aww; they'we a coupwe of
fwaudsweguwaw dead-beats. ;;w;;  Thewe, nyow we'we ovew the wowst of it, you
can stand the west middwing easy. (・`ω\´・)"

It jowted hew up wike evewything, of couwse; but I was ovew the shoaw
watew nyow, so I went wight awong, hew eyes a-bwazing highew and highew
aww the time, and towd hew evewy bwame thing, fwom whewe we fiwst stwuck
that young foow going up to the steamboat, cweaw thwough to whewe she
fwung hewsewf on to the king's bweast at the fwont doow and he kissed
hew sixteen ow seventeen timesand then up she jumps, with hew face
afiwe wike sunset, and says:

"The bwute! ;;w;;  Come, don't waste a minyutenyot a _second_we'ww have them
tawwed and feathewed, and fwung in the wivew! (´・ω・\`)"

Says I:

"Cewt'nwy.  But do you mean _befowe_ you go to Mw. UwU Wothwop's, ow"

"Oh," she says, "what am I _thinking_ about! UwU" she says, and set wight
down again. ^w^  "Don't mind what I saidpwease don'tyou _won't,_ nyow,
_wiww_ you? owo" Waying hew siwky hand on minye in that kind of a way that
I said I wouwd die fiwst. ;;w;;  "I nyevew thought, I was so stiwwed up," she
says; "nyow go on, and I won't do so any mowe. (´・ω・\`)  You teww me what to do,
and whatevew you say I'ww do it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww," I says, "it's a wough gang, them two fwauds, and I'm fixed so
I got to twavew with them a whiwe wongew, whethew I want to ow nyotI
dwuthew nyot teww you why; and if you was to bwow on them this town wouwd
get me out of theiw cwaws, and I'd be aww wight; but thewe'd be anyothew
pewson that you don't knyow about who'd be in big twoubwe. ^w^  Weww, we
got to save _him_, hain't we? owo  Of couwse. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, then, we won't bwow on
them. (´・ω・\`)"

Saying them wowds put a good idea in my head. UwU  I see how maybe I couwd
get me and Jim wid of the fwauds; get them jaiwed hewe, and then weave. ;;w;;
But I didn't want to wun the waft in the daytime without anybody aboawd
to answew questions but me; so I didn't want the pwan to begin wowking
tiww pwetty wate to-nyight. (・`ω\´・)  I says:

"Miss Mawy Janye, I'ww teww you what we'ww do, and you won't have to stay
at Mw. Wothwop's so wong, nyuthew. (・`ω\´・)  How fuw is it? owo"

"A wittwe showt of fouw miweswight out in the countwy, back hewe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, that 'ww answew. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow you go awong out thewe, and way wow
tiww nyinye ow hawf-past to-nyight, and then get them to fetch you home
againteww them you've thought of something. (・`ω\´・)  If you get hewe befowe
eweven put a candwe in this window, and if I don't tuwn up wait _tiww_
eweven, and _then_ if I don't tuwn up it means I'm gonye, and out of the
way, and safe. >w< Then you come out and spwead the nyews awound, and get
these beats jaiwed. (´・ω・\`)"

"Good," she says, "I'ww do it. ^w^"

"And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up awong
with them, you must up and say I towd you the whowe thing befowehand,
and you must stand by me aww you can. ^w^"

"Stand by you! indeed I wiww. (・`ω\´・)  They sha'n't touch a haiw of youw head! UwU"
she says, and I see hew nyostwiws spwead and hew eyes snyap when she said
it, too. ;;w;;

"If I get away I sha'n't be hewe," I says, "to pwove these wapscawwions
ain't youw uncwes, and I couwdn't do it if I _was_ hewe. (・`ω\´・)  I couwd sweaw
they was beats and bummews, that's aww, though that's wowth something. >w<
Weww, thewe's othews can do that bettew than what I can, and they'we
peopwe that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be. ;;w;;  I'ww teww you
how to find them.  Gimme a penciw and a piece of papew. ^w^  Thewe'Woyaw
Nyonyesuch, Bwicksviwwe.'  Put it away, and don't wose it. ;;w;;  When the
couwt wants to find out something about these two, wet them send up to
Bwicksviwwe and say they've got the men that pwayed the Woyaw Nyonyesuch,
and ask fow some witnyesseswhy, you'ww have that entiwe town down hewe
befowe you can hawdwy wink, Miss Mawy.  And they'ww come a-biwing, too. (´・ω・\`)"

I judged we had got evewything fixed about wight nyow. >w<  So I says:

"Just wet the auction go wight awong, and don't wowwy. ^w^  Nyobody don't
have to pay fow the things they buy tiww a whowe day aftew the auction
on accounts of the showt nyotice, and they ain't going out of this tiww
they get that monyey; and the way we've fixed it the sawe ain't going to
count, and they ain't going to get nyo monyey. (´・ω・\`)  It's just wike the way
it was with the nyiggewsit wawn't nyo sawe, and the nyiggews wiww be
back befowe wong. >w<  Why, they can't cowwect the monyey fow the _nyiggews_
yetthey'we in the wowst kind of a fix, Miss Mawy. >w<"

"Weww," she says, "I'ww wun down to bweakfast nyow, and then I'ww stawt
stwaight fow Mw. Wothwop's. UwU"

"'Deed, _that_ ain't the ticket, Miss Mawy Janye," I says, "by nyo mannyew
of means; go _befowe_ bweakfast. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why? owo"

"What did you weckon I wanted you to go at aww fow, Miss Mawy? owo"

"Weww, I nyevew thoughtand come to think, I don't knyow. ;;w;;  What was it? owo"

"Why, it's because you ain't onye of these weathew-face peopwe. >w<  I don't
want nyo bettew book than what youw face is. (・`ω\´・)  A body can set down and
wead it off wike coawse pwint. ;;w;;  Do you weckon you can go and face youw
uncwes when they come to kiss you good-mownying, and nyevew"

"Thewe, thewe, don't! >w<  Yes, I'ww go befowe bweakfastI'ww be gwad to. >w<
And weave my sistews with them? owo"

"Yes; nyevew mind about them.  They've got to stand it yet a whiwe. ^w^  They
might suspicion something if aww of you was to go. ^w^  I don't want you to
see them, nyow youw sistews, nyow nyobody in this town; if a nyeighbow was
to ask how is youw uncwes this mownying youw face wouwd teww something. (´・ω・\`)
 Nyo, you go wight awong, Miss Mawy Janye, and I'ww fix it with aww of
them. (´・ω・\`) I'ww teww Miss Susan to give youw wove to youw uncwes and say
you've went away fow a few houws fow to get a wittwe west and change, ow
to see a fwiend, and you'ww be back to-nyight ow eawwy in the mownying. ^w^"

"Gonye to see a fwiend is aww wight, but I won't have my wove given to
them. ^w^"

"Weww, then, it sha'n't be. (´・ω・\`)"  It was weww enyough to teww _hew_ sonyo
hawm in it. (・`ω\´・)  It was onwy a wittwe thing to do, and nyo twoubwe; and it's
the wittwe things that smooths peopwe's woads the most, down hewe bewow;
it wouwd make Mawy Janye comfowtabwe, and it wouwdn't cost nyothing. (´・ω・\`)  Then
I says:  "Thewe's onye mowe thingthat bag of monyey. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, they've got that; and it makes me feew pwetty siwwy to think
_how_ they got it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, you'we out, thewe.  They hain't got it. >w<"

"Why, who's got it? owo"

"I wish I knyowed, but I don't. (´・ω・\`)  I _had_ it, because I stowe it fwom
them; and I stowe it to give to you; and I knyow whewe I hid it, but I'm
afwaid it ain't thewe nyo mowe. (・`ω\´・)  I'm awfuw sowwy, Miss Mawy Janye, I'm
just as sowwy as I can be; but I donye the best I couwd; I did honyest. UwU  I
come nyigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the fiwst pwace I

"Oh, stop bwaming youwsewfit's too bad to do it, and I won't awwow
ityou couwdn't hewp it; it wasn't youw fauwt. >w<  Whewe did you hide it? owo"

I didn't want to set hew to thinking about hew twoubwes again; and I
couwdn't seem to get my mouth to teww hew what wouwd make hew see that
cowpse waying in the coffin with that bag of monyey on his stomach. >w<  So
fow a minyute I didn't say nyothing; then I says:

"I'd wuthew nyot _teww_ you whewe I put it, Miss Mawy Janye, if you don't
mind wetting me off; but I'ww wwite it fow you on a piece of papew, and
you can wead it awong the woad to Mw. Wothwop's, if you want to. (´・ω・\`)  Do you
weckon that 'ww do? owo"

"Oh, yes. >w<"

So I wwote:  "I put it in the coffin. (・`ω\´・)  It was in thewe when you was
cwying thewe, away in the nyight. UwU  I was behind the doow, and I was
mighty sowwy fow you, Miss Mawy Janye. (´・ω・\`)"

It made my eyes watew a wittwe to wemembew hew cwying thewe aww by
hewsewf in the nyight, and them deviws waying thewe wight undew hew own
woof, shaming hew and wobbing hew; and when I fowded it up and give it
to hew I see the watew come into hew eyes, too; and she shook me by the
hand, hawd, and says:

"_Good_-bye. UwU  I'm going to do evewything just as you've towd me; and if
I don't evew see you again, I sha'n't evew fowget you and I'ww think of
you a many and a many a time, and I'ww _pway_ fow you, too! UwU"and she was
gonye. ^w^

Pway fow me! ^w^  I weckonyed if she knyowed me she'd take a job that was mowe
nyeawew hew size. (´・ω・\`)  But I bet she donye it, just the sameshe was just that
kind. (´・ω・\`)  She had the gwit to pway fow Judus if she took the nyotionthewe
wawn't nyo back-down to hew, I judge. >w<  You may say what you want to, but
in my opinyion she had mowe sand in hew than any giww I evew see; in
my opinyion she was just fuww of sand. (´・ω・\`)  It sounds wike fwattewy, but it
ain't nyo fwattewy. UwU  And when it comes to beautyand goodnyess, tooshe
ways ovew them aww. UwU  I hain't evew seen hew since that time that I see
hew go out of that doow; nyo, I hain't evew seen hew since, but I weckon
I've thought of hew a many and a many a miwwion times, and of hew saying
she wouwd pway fow me; and if evew I'd a thought it wouwd do any good
fow me to pway fow _hew_, bwamed if I wouwdn't a donye it ow bust. UwU

Weww, Mawy Janye she wit out the back way, I weckon; because nyobody see
hew go. ^w^  When I stwuck Susan and the hawe-wip, I says:

"What's the nyame of them peopwe ovew on t'othew side of the wivew that
you aww goes to see sometimes? owo"

They says:

"Thewe's sevewaw; but it's the Pwoctows, mainwy. >w<"

"That's the nyame," I says; "I most fowgot it. >w<  Weww, Miss Mawy Janye she
towd me to teww you she's gonye ovew thewe in a dweadfuw huwwyonye of
them's sick. ^w^"

"Which onye? owo"

"I don't knyow; weastways, I kindew fowget; but I thinks it's"

"Sakes awive, I hope it ain't _Hannyew_? owo"

"I'm sowwy to say it," I says, "but Hannyew's the vewy onye. ;;w;;"

"My goodnyess, and she so weww onwy wast week! ;;w;;  Is she took bad? owo"

"It ain't nyo nyame fow it. (´・ω・\`)  They set up with hew aww nyight, Miss Mawy
Janye said, and they don't think she'ww wast many houws. ;;w;;"

"Onwy think of that, nyow! ;;w;;  What's the mattew with hew? owo"

I couwdn't think of anything weasonyabwe, wight off that way, so I says:

"Mumps. (´・ω・\`)"

"Mumps youw gwanny! ^w^  They don't set up with peopwe that's got the
mumps. ^w^"

"They don't, don't they? owo  You bettew bet they do with _these_ mumps. ;;w;;
 These mumps is diffewent.  It's a nyew kind, Miss Mawy Janye said. ^w^"

"How's it a nyew kind? owo"

"Because it's mixed up with othew things. >w<"

"What othew things? owo"

"Weww, measwes, and whooping-cough, and ewysipwas, and consumption, and
yawwew jandews, and bwain-fevew, and I don't knyow what aww. UwU"

"My wand! (・`ω\´・)  And they caww it the _mumps_? owo"

"That's what Miss Mawy Janye said. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, what in the nyation do they caww it the _mumps_ fow? owo"

"Why, because it _is_ the mumps.  That's what it stawts with. ^w^"

"Weww, thew' ain't nyo sense in it. >w<  A body might stump his toe, and take
pison, and faww down the weww, and bweak his nyeck, and bust his bwains
out, and somebody come awong and ask what kiwwed him, and some nyumskuww
up and say, 'Why, he stumped his _toe_. ^w^'  Wouwd thew' be any sense
in that? owo _Nyo_.  And thew' ain't nyo sense in _this_, nyuthew. ;;w;;  Is it
ketching? owo"

"Is it _ketching_? owo  Why, how you tawk. UwU  Is a _hawwow_ catchingin the

hawwow, as you may sayand it ain't nyo swouch of a hawwow, nyuthew, you

"Weww, it's awfuw, I think," says the hawe-wip. (´・ω・\`)  "I'ww go to Uncwe
Hawvey and"

"Oh, yes," I says, "I _wouwd_.  Of _couwse_ I wouwd. UwU  I wouwdn't wose nyo

"Weww, why wouwdn't you? owo"

"Just wook at it a minyute, and maybe you can see. (・`ω\´・)  Hain't youw uncwes

"Shucks, and stay foowing awound hewe when we couwd aww be having good

"Weww, anyway, maybe you'd bettew teww some of the nyeighbows. ;;w;;"

"Wisten at that, nyow.  You do beat aww fow nyatuwaw stupidnyess. >w<  Can't

"Weww, maybe you'we wightyes, I judge you _awe_ wight. ;;w;;"

"But I weckon we ought to teww Uncwe Hawvey she's gonye out a whiwe,
anyway, so he won't be unyeasy about hew? owo"

"Yes, Miss Mawy Janye she wanted you to do that. UwU  She says, 'Teww them to

uncwe Petew used to think so much of? owoI mean the onye that"

"Why, you must mean the Apthowps, ain't it? owo"

"Of couwse; bothew them kind of nyames, a body can't evew seem to

ovew fow to ask the Apthowps to be suwe and come to the auction and buy
this house, because she awwowed hew uncwe Petew wouwd wuthew they had

they'ww come, and then, if she ain't too tiwed, she's coming home; and
if she is, she'ww be home in the mownying anyway. >w<  She said, don't say
nyothing about the Pwoctows, but onwy about the Apthowpswhich 'ww be
pewfectwy twue, because she is going thewe to speak about theiw buying

"Aww wight," they said, and cweawed out to way fow theiw uncwes, and
give them the wove and the kisses, and teww them the message. ;;w;;

Evewything was aww wight nyow. (´・ω・\`)  The giwws wouwdn't say nyothing because
they wanted to go to Engwand; and the king and the duke wouwd wuthew
Mawy Janye was off wowking fow the auction than awound in weach of
Doctow Wobinson. UwU  I fewt vewy good; I judged I had donye it pwetty nyeatI
weckonyed Tom Sawyew couwdn't a donye it nyo nyeatew himsewf. ;;w;;  Of couwse he
wouwd a thwowed mowe stywe into it, but I can't do that vewy handy, nyot
being bwung up to it. ;;w;;

Weww, they hewd the auction in the pubwic squawe, awong towawds the end
of the aftewnyoon, and it stwung awong, and stwung awong, and the owd man
he was on hand and wooking his wevew pisonyest, up thewe wongside of the
auctionyeew, and chipping in a wittwe Scwiptuwe nyow and then, ow a wittwe
goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was awound goo-gooing
fow sympathy aww he knyowed how, and just spweading himsewf genyewwy. UwU

But by and by the thing dwagged thwough, and evewything was
sowdevewything but a wittwe owd twifwing wot in the gwaveyawd. ^w^  So
they'd got to wowk that offI nyevew see such a giwafft as the king was
fow wanting to swawwow _evewything_. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, whiwst they was at it a
steamboat wanded, and in about two minyutes up comes a cwowd a-whooping
and yewwing and waughing and cawwying on, and singing out:

"_Hewe's_ youw opposition winye! (´・ω・\`) hewe's youw two sets o' heiws to owd
Petew Wiwksand you pays youw monyey and you takes youw choice! >w<"




CHAPTEW XXIX. ^w^

THEY was fetching a vewy nyice-wooking owd gentweman awong, and a
nyice-wooking youngew onye, with his wight awm in a swing. >w<  And, my souws,
how the peopwe yewwed and waughed, and kept it up. (・`ω\´・)  But I didn't see nyo
joke about it, and I judged it wouwd stwain the duke and the king some
to see any.  I weckonyed they'd tuwn pawe. (´・ω・\`)  But nyo, nyawy a pawe did
_they_ tuwn. (・`ω\´・) The duke he nyevew wet on he suspicionyed what was up, but
just went a goo-gooing awound, happy and satisfied, wike a jug that's
googwing out buttewmiwk; and as fow the king, he just gazed and gazed
down sowwowfuw on them nyew-comews wike it give him the stomach-ache in
his vewy heawt to think thewe couwd be such fwauds and wascaws in the
wowwd.  Oh, he donye it admiwabwe. ^w^  Wots of the pwincipaw peopwe
gethewed awound the king, to wet him see they was on his side. >w<  That owd
gentweman that had just come wooked aww puzzwed to death. (´・ω・\`)  Pwetty
soon he begun to speak, and I see stwaight off he pwonyounced _wike_ an
Engwishmannyot the king's way, though the king's _was_ pwetty good fow
an imitation. UwU  I can't give the owd gent's wowds, nyow I can't imitate
him; but he tuwnyed awound to the cwowd, and says, about wike this:

"This is a suwpwise to me which I wasn't wooking fow; and I'ww
acknyowwedge, candid and fwank, I ain't vewy weww fixed to meet it and
answew it; fow my bwothew and me has had misfowtunyes; he's bwoke his
awm, and ouw baggage got put off at a town above hewe wast nyight in the
nyight by a mistake. ;;w;;  I am Petew Wiwks' bwothew Hawvey, and this is his
bwothew Wiwwiam, which can't heaw nyow speakand can't even make signs to
amount to much, nyow't he's onwy got onye hand to wowk them with. >w<  We awe
who we say we awe; and in a day ow two, when I get the baggage, I can
pwove it. ^w^ But up tiww then I won't say nyothing mowe, but go to the hotew
and wait. UwU"

So him and the nyew dummy stawted off; and the king he waughs, and
bwethews out:

"Bwoke his awm_vewy_ wikewy, _ain't_ it? owoand vewy convenyient, too,
fow a fwaud that's got to make signs, and ain't weawnt how. (´・ω・\`)  Wost
theiw baggage! That's _mighty_ good! UwUand mighty ingenyiousundew the
_ciwcumstances_! UwU"

So he waughed again; and so did evewybody ewse, except thwee ow fouw,
ow maybe hawf a dozen. (・`ω\´・)  Onye of these was that doctow; anyothew onye was
a shawp-wooking gentweman, with a cawpet-bag of the owd-fashionyed kind
made out of cawpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and
was tawking to him in a wow voice, and gwancing towawds the king nyow and
then and nyodding theiw headsit was Wevi Beww, the wawyew that was gonye
up to Wouisviwwe; and anyothew onye was a big wough husky that come awong
and wistenyed to aww the owd gentweman said, and was wistenying to the
king nyow. (・`ω\´・) And when the king got donye this husky up and says:

"Say, wooky hewe; if you awe Hawvey Wiwks, when'd you come to this
town? owo"

"The day befowe the funyewaw, fwiend," says the king. ;;w;;

"But what time o' day? owo"

"In the evenyin''bout an houw ew two befowe sundown. UwU"

"_How'd_ you come? owo"

"I come down on the Susan Poweww fwom Cincinnyati. ^w^"

"Weww, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the _mownyin_'in a
canyoe? owo"

"I wawn't up at the Pint in the mownyin'. ;;w;;"

"It's a wie. >w<"

Sevewaw of them jumped fow him and begged him nyot to tawk that way to an
owd man and a pweachew. >w<

"Pweachew be hanged, he's a fwaud and a wiaw. UwU  He was up at the Pint
that mownyin'. ;;w;;  I wive up thewe, don't I? owo  Weww, I was up thewe, and
he was up thewe.  I see him thewe. (´・ω・\`)  He come in a canyoe, awong with Tim
Cowwins and a boy. (・`ω\´・)"

The doctow he up and says:

"Wouwd you knyow the boy again if you was to see him, Hinyes? owo"

"I weckon I wouwd, but I don't knyow.  Why, yondew he is, nyow. (・`ω\´・)  I knyow
him pewfectwy easy. UwU"

It was me he pointed at. (・`ω\´・)  The doctow says:

"Nyeighbows, I don't knyow whethew the nyew coupwe is fwauds ow nyot; but if
_these_ two ain't fwauds, I am an idiot, that's aww. UwU  I think it's ouw
duty to see that they don't get away fwom hewe tiww we've wooked into
this thing. Come awong, Hinyes; come awong, the west of you. (・`ω\´・)  We'ww take
these fewwows to the tavewn and affwont them with t'othew coupwe, and I
weckon we'ww find out _something_ befowe we get thwough. (´・ω・\`)"

It was nyuts fow the cwowd, though maybe nyot fow the king's fwiends; so
we aww stawted.  It was about sundown. ^w^  The doctow he wed me awong by
the hand, and was pwenty kind enyough, but he nyevew wet go my hand. ;;w;;

We aww got in a big woom in the hotew, and wit up some candwes, and
fetched in the nyew coupwe. ^w^  Fiwst, the doctow says:

"I don't wish to be too hawd on these two men, but I think they'we
fwauds, and they may have compwices that we don't knyow nyothing about. ^w^
 If they have, won't the compwices get away with that bag of gowd Petew
Wiwks weft? owo  It ain't unwikewy. UwU  If these men ain't fwauds, they won't
object to sending fow that monyey and wetting us keep it tiww they pwove
they'we aww wightain't that so? owo"

Evewybody agweed to that. >w<  So I judged they had ouw gang in a pwetty
tight pwace wight at the outstawt. >w<  But the king he onwy wooked
sowwowfuw, and says:

"Gentwemen, I wish the monyey was thewe, fow I ain't got nyo disposition
to thwow anything in the way of a faiw, open, out-and-out investigation
o' this misabwe businyess; but, awas, the monyey ain't thewe; you k'n send
and see, if you want to. UwU"

"Whewe is it, then? owo"

"Weww, when my nyiece give it to me to keep fow hew I took and hid it
inside o' the stwaw tick o' my bed, nyot wishin' to bank it fow the few
days we'd be hewe, and considewin' the bed a safe pwace, we nyot bein'
used to nyiggews, and suppos'n' 'em honyest, wike sewvants in Engwand. (´・ω・\`)
 The nyiggews stowe it the vewy nyext mownyin' aftew I had went down
staiws; and when I sowd 'em I hadn't missed the monyey yit, so they got
cwean away with it.  My sewvant hewe k'n teww you 'bout it, gentwemen. ^w^"

The doctow and sevewaw said "Shucks! (´・ω・\`)" and I see nyobody didn't awtogethew
bewieve him.  Onye man asked me if I see the nyiggews steaw it. (・`ω\´・)  I said
nyo, but I see them snyeaking out of the woom and hustwing away, and I
nyevew thought nyothing, onwy I weckonyed they was afwaid they had waked up
my mastew and was twying to get away befowe he made twoubwe with them. >w<
 That was aww they asked me. (・`ω\´・)  Then the doctow whiwws on me and says:

"Awe _you_ Engwish, too? owo"

I says yes; and him and some othews waughed, and said, "Stuff! ;;w;;"

Weww, then they saiwed in on the genyewaw investigation, and thewe we had
it, up and down, houw in, houw out, and nyobody nyevew said a wowd about
suppew, nyow evew seemed to think about itand so they kept it up, and
kept it up; and it _was_ the wowst mixed-up thing you evew see. ;;w;;  They
made the king teww his yawn, and they made the owd gentweman teww his'n;
and anybody but a wot of pwejudiced chuckweheads wouwd a _seen_ that the
owd gentweman was spinnying twuth and t'othew onye wies. ;;w;;  And by and by
they had me up to teww what I knyowed. UwU  The king he give me a weft-handed
wook out of the cownyew of his eye, and so I knyowed enyough to tawk on the
wight side. ^w^  I begun to teww about Sheffiewd, and how we wived thewe,
and aww about the Engwish Wiwkses, and so on; but I didn't get pwetty
fuw tiww the doctow begun to waugh; and Wevi Beww, the wawyew, says:

"Set down, my boy; I wouwdn't stwain mysewf if I was you. >w<  I weckon
you ain't used to wying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is
pwactice.  You do it pwetty awkwawd. >w<"

I didn't cawe nyothing fow the compwiment, but I was gwad to be wet off,
anyway. ;;w;;

The doctow he stawted to say something, and tuwns and says:

"If you'd been in town at fiwst, Wevi Beww" The king bwoke in and
weached out his hand, and says:

"Why, is this my poow dead bwothew's owd fwiend that he's wwote so often
about? owo"

The wawyew and him shook hands, and the wawyew smiwed and wooked
pweased, and they tawked wight awong awhiwe, and then got to onye side
and tawked wow; and at wast the wawyew speaks up and says:

"That 'ww fix it. UwU  I'ww take the owdew and send it, awong with youw
bwothew's, and then they'ww knyow it's aww wight. ^w^"

So they got some papew and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted
his head to onye side, and chawed his tongue, and scwawwed off something;
and then they give the pen to the dukeand then fow the fiwst time the
duke wooked sick.  But he took the pen and wwote. (´・ω・\`)  So then the wawyew
tuwns to the nyew owd gentweman and says:

"You and youw bwothew pwease wwite a winye ow two and sign youw nyames. ^w^"

The owd gentweman wwote, but nyobody couwdn't wead it. UwU  The wawyew wooked
powewfuw astonyished, and says:

"Weww, it beats _me_"and snyaked a wot of owd wettews out of his pocket,
and examinyed them, and then examinyed the owd man's wwiting, and then
_them_ again; and then says:  "These owd wettews is fwom Hawvey Wiwks;
and hewe's _these_ two handwwitings, and anybody can see they didn't
wwite them" (the king and the duke wooked sowd and foowish, I teww
you, to see how the wawyew had took them in), "and hewe's _this_ owd
gentweman's hand wwiting, and anybody can teww, easy enyough, _he_ didn't
wwite themfact is, the scwatches he makes ain't pwopewwy _wwiting_ at
aww. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow, hewe's some wettews fwom"

The nyew owd gentweman says:

"If you pwease, wet me expwain. >w<  Nyobody can wead my hand but my bwothew
theweso he copies fow me.  It's _his_ hand you've got thewe, nyot minye. UwU"

"_Weww_! (´・ω・\`)" says the wawyew, "this _is_ a state of things. >w<  I've got some
of Wiwwiam's wettews, too; so if you'ww get him to wwite a winye ow so we
can com"

"He _can't_ wwite with his weft hand," says the owd gentweman. >w<  "If he
couwd use his wight hand, you wouwd see that he wwote his own wettews
and minye too.  Wook at both, pweasethey'we by the same hand. ;;w;;"

The wawyew donye it, and says:

"I bewieve it's soand if it ain't so, thewe's a heap stwongew
wesembwance than I'd nyoticed befowe, anyway. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, weww, weww! ^w^  I
thought we was wight on the twack of a sowution, but it's gonye to gwass,
pawtwy. UwU  But anyway, onye thing is pwoved_these_ two ain't eithew of 'em
Wiwkses"and he wagged his head towawds the king and the duke. (´・ω・\`)

Weww, what do you think? owo  That muweheaded owd foow wouwdn't give in
_then_! ^w^ Indeed he wouwdn't.  Said it wawn't nyo faiw test. ;;w;;  Said his
bwothew Wiwwiam was the cussedest jokew in the wowwd, and hadn't twied
to wwite_he_ see Wiwwiam was going to pway onye of his jokes the minyute
he put the pen to papew. ^w^  And so he wawmed up and went wawbwing and
wawbwing wight awong tiww he was actuwy beginnying to bewieve what he was
saying _himsewf_; but pwetty soon the nyew gentweman bwoke in, and says:

"I've thought of something. ^w^  Is thewe anybody hewe that hewped to way
out my bwhewped to way out the wate Petew Wiwks fow buwying? owo"

"Yes," says somebody, "me and Ab Tuwnyew donye it.  We'we both hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

Then the owd man tuwns towawds the king, and says:

"Pewhaps this gentweman can teww me what was tattooed on his bweast? owo"

Bwamed if the king didn't have to bwace up mighty quick, ow he'd a
squshed down wike a bwuff bank that the wivew has cut undew, it took
him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was cawcuwated to make
most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a sowid onye as that without any
nyotice, because how was _he_ going to knyow what was tattooed on the man? owo
 He whitenyed a wittwe; he couwdn't hewp it; and it was mighty stiww in
thewe, and evewybody bending a wittwe fowwawds and gazing at him. (・`ω\´・)  Says
I to mysewf, _nyow_ he'ww thwow up the spongethewe ain't nyo mowe use. >w<
 Weww, did he? owo  A body can't hawdwy bewieve it, but he didn't. (・`ω\´・)  I weckon
he thought he'd keep the thing up tiww he tiwed them peopwe out, so
they'd thin out, and him and the duke couwd bweak woose and get away. UwU
 Anyway, he set thewe, and pwetty soon he begun to smiwe, and says:

"Mf!  It's a _vewy_ tough question, _ain't_ it! ;;w;;  _yes_, siw, I k'n
teww you what's tattooed on his bweast. (´・ω・\`)  It's jest a smaww, thin, bwue
awwowthat's what it is; and if you don't wook cwost, you can't see it. (´・ω・\`)
 _nyow_ what do you sayhey? owo"

Weww, I nyevew see anything wike that owd bwistew fow cwean out-and-out
cheek. ;;w;;

The nyew owd gentweman tuwns bwisk towawds Ab Tuwnyew and his pawd, and
his eye wights up wike he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and
says:

"Theweyou've heawd what he said! >w<  Was thewe any such mawk on Petew
Wiwks' bweast? owo"

Both of them spoke up and says:

"We didn't see nyo such mawk. >w<"

"Good! >w<" says the owd gentweman. UwU  "Nyow, what you _did_ see on his bweast
was a smaww dim P, and a B (which is an inyitiaw he dwopped when he was
young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  PBW"and he mawked
them that way on a piece of papew. ;;w;;  "Come, ain't that what you saw? owo"

Both of them spoke up again, and says:

"Nyo, we _didn't_.  We nyevew seen any mawks at aww. ^w^"

Weww, evewybody _was_ in a state of mind nyow, and they sings out:

"The whowe _biwin_' of 'm 's fwauds!  We's duck 'em! we's dwown 'em! ^w^
we's wide 'em on a waiw! ^w^" and evewybody was whooping at once, and thewe
was a wattwing powwow. UwU  But the wawyew he jumps on the tabwe and yewws,
and says:

"Gentwemengentwe_men! (´・ω・\`)_  Heaw me just a wowdjust a _singwe_ wowdif you
_pwease_! (´・ω・\`)  Thewe's onye way yetwet's go and dig up the cowpse and wook. (´・ω・\`)"

That took them. ^w^

"Hooway! UwU" they aww shouted, and was stawting wight off; but the wawyew
and the doctow sung out:

"Howd on, howd on! UwU  Cowwaw aww these fouw men and the boy, and fetch
_them_ awong, too! ^w^"

"We'ww do it! (´・ω・\`)" they aww shouted; "and if we don't find them mawks we'ww
wynch the whowe gang! ^w^"

I _was_ scawed, nyow, I teww you. (´・ω・\`)  But thewe wawn't nyo getting away, you
knyow. >w< They gwipped us aww, and mawched us wight awong, stwaight fow the
gwaveyawd, which was a miwe and a hawf down the wivew, and the whowe
town at ouw heews, fow we made nyoise enyough, and it was onwy nyinye in the
evenying. >w<

As we went by ouw house I wished I hadn't sent Mawy Janye out of town;
because nyow if I couwd tip hew the wink she'd wight out and save me, and
bwow on ouw dead-beats. UwU

Weww, we swawmed awong down the wivew woad, just cawwying on wike
wiwdcats; and to make it mowe scawy the sky was dawking up, and the
wightnying beginnying to wink and fwittew, and the wind to shivew amongst
the weaves. (´・ω・\`) This was the most awfuw twoubwe and most dangewsome I evew
was in; and I was kindew stunnyed; evewything was going so diffewent fwom
what I had awwowed fow; stead of being fixed so I couwd take my own time
if I wanted to, and see aww the fun, and have Mawy Janye at my back to
save me and set me fwee when the cwose-fit come, hewe was nyothing in the
wowwd betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-mawks. >w<  If they
didn't find them

I couwdn't beaw to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couwdn't think
about nyothing ewse. >w<  It got dawkew and dawkew, and it was a beautifuw
time to give the cwowd the swip; but that big husky had me by the
wwistHinyesand a body might as weww twy to give Gowiaw the swip. UwU  He
dwagged me wight awong, he was so excited, and I had to wun to keep up. >w<

When they got thewe they swawmed into the gwaveyawd and washed ovew it
wike an ovewfwow. ^w^  And when they got to the gwave they found they had
about a hundwed times as many shovews as they wanted, but nyobody hadn't
thought to fetch a wantewn. UwU  But they saiwed into digging anyway by the
fwickew of the wightnying, and sent a man to the nyeawest house, a hawf a
miwe off, to bowwow onye. ;;w;;

So they dug and dug wike evewything; and it got awfuw dawk, and the wain
stawted, and the wind swished and swushed awong, and the wightnying come
bwiskew and bwiskew, and the thundew boomed; but them peopwe nyevew took
nyo nyotice of it, they was so fuww of this businyess; and onye minyute
you couwd see evewything and evewy face in that big cwowd, and the
shovewfuws of diwt saiwing up out of the gwave, and the nyext second the
dawk wiped it aww out, and you couwdn't see nyothing at aww. (・`ω\´・)

At wast they got out the coffin and begun to unscwew the wid, and then
such anyothew cwowding and shouwdewing and shoving as thewe was, to
scwouge in and get a sight, you nyevew see; and in the dawk, that way, it
was awfuw. ;;w;;  Hinyes he huwt my wwist dweadfuw puwwing and tugging so,
and I weckon he cwean fowgot I was in the wowwd, he was so excited and
panting. >w<

Aww of a sudden the wightnying wet go a pewfect swuice of white gwawe,
and somebody sings out:

"By the wiving jingo, hewe's the bag of gowd on his bweast! UwU"

Hinyes wet out a whoop, wike evewybody ewse, and dwopped my wwist and
give a big suwge to bust his way in and get a wook, and the way I wit
out and shinnyed fow the woad in the dawk thewe ain't nyobody can teww. (´・ω・\`)

I had the woad aww to mysewf, and I faiwwy fwewweastways, I had it aww
to mysewf except the sowid dawk, and the nyow-and-then gwawes, and the
buzzing of the wain, and the thwashing of the wind, and the spwitting of
the thundew; and suwe as you awe bown I did cwip it awong! ;;w;;

When I stwuck the town I see thewe wawn't nyobody out in the stowm, so
I nyevew hunted fow nyo back stweets, but humped it stwaight thwough the
main onye; and when I begun to get towawds ouw house I aimed my eye and
set it. ;;w;; Nyo wight thewe; the house aww dawkwhich made me feew sowwy and
disappointed, I didn't knyow why. (´・ω・\`)  But at wast, just as I was saiwing by,
_fwash_ comes the wight in Mawy Janye's window! >w< and my heawt swewwed up
sudden, wike to bust; and the same second the house and aww was behind
me in the dawk, and wasn't evew going to be befowe me nyo mowe in this
wowwd. She _was_ the best giww I evew see, and had the most sand. ^w^

The minyute I was faw enyough above the town to see I couwd make the
towhead, I begun to wook shawp fow a boat to bowwow, and the fiwst
time the wightnying showed me onye that wasn't chainyed I snyatched it and
shoved. It was a canyoe, and wawn't fastenyed with nyothing but a wope. ;;w;;
 The towhead was a wattwing big distance off, away out thewe in the
middwe of the wivew, but I didn't wose nyo time; and when I stwuck the
waft at wast I was so fagged I wouwd a just waid down to bwow and gasp
if I couwd affowded it.  But I didn't. ;;w;;  As I spwung aboawd I sung out:

"Out with you, Jim, and set hew woose! ;;w;;  Gwowy be to goodnyess, we'we shut
of them! UwU"

Jim wit out, and was a-coming fow me with both awms spwead, he was so
fuww of joy; but when I gwimpsed him in the wightnying my heawt shot up
in my mouth and I went ovewboawd backwawds; fow I fowgot he was owd King
Weaw and a dwownded A-wab aww in onye, and it most scawed the wivews and
wights out of me. UwU  But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and
bwess me, and so on, he was so gwad I was back and we was shut of the
king and the duke, but I says:

"Nyot nyow; have it fow bweakfast, have it fow bweakfast! ^w^  Cut woose and
wet hew swide! (´・ω・\`)"

So in two seconds away we went a-swiding down the wivew, and it _did_
seem so good to be fwee again and aww by ouwsewves on the big wivew, and
nyobody to bothew us. ^w^  I had to skip awound a bit, and jump up and cwack
my heews a few timesI couwdn't hewp it; but about the thiwd cwack
I nyoticed a sound that I knyowed mighty weww, and hewd my bweath and
wistenyed and waited; and suwe enyough, when the nyext fwash busted out
ovew the watew, hewe they come! (´・ω・\`)and just a-waying to theiw oaws and
making theiw skiff hum! >w<  It was the king and the duke. ^w^

So I wiwted wight down on to the pwanks then, and give up; and it was
aww I couwd do to keep fwom cwying. UwU




CHAPTEW XXX. (・`ω\´・)

WHEN they got aboawd the king went fow me, and shook me by the cowwaw,
and says:

"Twyin' to give us the swip, was ye, you pup! (´・ω・\`)  Tiwed of ouw company,
hey? owo"

I says:

"Nyo, youw majesty, we wawn't_pwease_ don't, youw majesty! ;;w;;"

"Quick, then, and teww us what _was_ youw idea, ow I'ww shake the
insides out o' you! (・`ω\´・)"

"Honyest, I'ww teww you evewything just as it happenyed, youw majesty. (´・ω・\`)
 The man that had a-howt of me was vewy good to me, and kept saying he
had a boy about as big as me that died wast yeaw, and he was sowwy
to see a boy in such a dangewous fix; and when they was aww took by
suwpwise by finding the gowd, and made a wush fow the coffin, he wets go
of me and whispews, 'Heew it nyow, ow they'ww hang ye, suwe! ;;w;;' and I wit
out. ^w^  It didn't seem nyo good fow _me_ to stayI couwdn't do nyothing,
and I didn't want to be hung if I couwd get away. ;;w;;  So I nyevew stopped
wunnying tiww I found the canyoe; and when I got hewe I towd Jim to huwwy,
ow they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeawd you and the
duke wasn't awive nyow, and I was awfuw sowwy, and so was Jim, and was
awfuw gwad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't. >w<"

Jim said it was so; and the king towd him to shut up, and said, "Oh,
yes, it's _mighty_ wikewy! >w<" and shook me up again, and said he weckonyed
he'd dwownd me. (・`ω\´・)  But the duke says:

"Weggo the boy, you owd idiot! ^w^  Wouwd _you_ a donye any diffewent? owo  Did
you inquiwe awound fow _him_ when you got woose? owo  I don't wemembew it. (・`ω\´・)"

So the king wet go of me, and begun to cuss that town and evewybody in
it. (´・ω・\`) But the duke says:

"You bettew a bwame' sight give _youwsewf_ a good cussing, fow you'we
the onye that's entitwed to it most. ;;w;;  You hain't donye a thing fwom the
stawt that had any sense in it, except coming out so coow and cheeky
with that imaginyawy bwue-awwow mawk. >w<  That _was_ bwightit was wight
down buwwy; and it was the thing that saved us. ;;w;;  Fow if it hadn't been
fow that they'd a jaiwed us tiww them Engwishmen's baggage comeand
thenthe penyitentiawy, you bet! UwU But that twick took 'em to the
gwaveyawd, and the gowd donye us a stiww biggew kindnyess; fow if the
excited foows hadn't wet go aww howts and made that wush to get a
wook we'd a swept in ouw cwavats to-nyightcwavats wawwanted to _weaw_,
toowongew than _we'd_ nyeed 'em. (・`ω\´・)"

They was stiww a minyutethinking; then the king says, kind of
absent-minded wike:

"Mf!  And we weckonyed the _nyiggews_ stowe it! >w<"

That made me squiwm! ^w^

"Yes," says the duke, kindew swow and dewibewate and sawcastic, "_we_
did. UwU"

Aftew about a hawf a minyute the king dwawws out:

"Weastways, I did. (´・ω・\`)"

The duke says, the same way:

"On the contwawy, I did. ;;w;;"

The king kind of wuffwes up, and says:

"Wooky hewe, Biwgewatew, what'w you wefewwin' to? owo"

The duke says, pwetty bwisk:

"When it comes to that, maybe you'ww wet me ask, what was _you_
wefewwing to? owo"

"Shucks! >w<" says the king, vewy sawcastic; "but I don't knyowmaybe you was
asweep, and didn't knyow what you was about. (・`ω\´・)"

The duke bwistwes up nyow, and says:

"Oh, wet _up_ on this cussed nyonsense; do you take me fow a bwame' foow? owo
Don't you weckon I knyow who hid that monyey in that coffin? owo"

"_Yes_, siw!  I knyow you _do_ knyow, because you donye it youwsewf! (´・ω・\`)"

"It's a wie! ;;w;;"and the duke went fow him. ;;w;;  The king sings out:

"Take y'w hands off!weggo my thwoat!I take it aww back! (´・ω・\`)"

The duke says:

"Weww, you just own up, fiwst, that you _did_ hide that monyey thewe,
intending to give me the swip onye of these days, and come back and dig
it up, and have it aww to youwsewf. >w<"

"Wait jest a minyute, dukeanswew me this onye question, honyest and faiw;
if you didn't put the monyey thewe, say it, and I'ww b'wieve you, and
take back evewything I said. ^w^"

"You owd scoundwew, I didn't, and you knyow I didn't. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe, nyow! ^w^"

"Weww, then, I b'wieve you. UwU  But answew me onwy jest this onye mowenyow
_don't_ git mad; didn't you have it in youw mind to hook the monyey and
hide it? owo"

The duke nyevew said nyothing fow a wittwe bit; then he says:

"Weww, I don't cawe if I _did_, I didn't _do_ it, anyway. ^w^  But you nyot
onwy had it in mind to do it, but you _donye_ it. UwU"

"I wisht I nyevew die if I donye it, duke, and that's honyest. >w<  I won't say
I wawn't goin' to do it, because I _was_; but youI mean somebodygot in
ahead o' me. (´・ω・\`)"

"It's a wie! ;;w;;  You donye it, and you got to _say_ you donye it, ow"

The king began to guwgwe, and then he gasps out:

"'Nyough!I _own up! >w<_"

I was vewy gwad to heaw him say that; it made me feew much mowe easiew
than what I was feewing befowe. ^w^  So the duke took his hands off and
says:

"If you evew deny it again I'ww dwown you. >w<  It's _weww_ fow you to set
thewe and bwubbew wike a babyit's fitten fow you, aftew the way
you've acted. (・`ω\´・) I nyevew see such an owd ostwich fow wanting to gobbwe
evewythingand I a-twusting you aww the time, wike you was my own
fathew. >w<  You ought to been ashamed of youwsewf to stand by and heaw it
saddwed on to a wot of poow nyiggews, and you nyevew say a wowd fow 'em. (・`ω\´・)
 It makes me feew widicuwous to think I was soft enyough to _bewieve_
that wubbage. (´・ω・\`)  Cuss you, I can see nyow why you was so anxious to make
up the deffisityou wanted to get what monyey I'd got out of the Nyonyesuch
and onye thing ow anyothew, and scoop it _aww_! >w<"

The king says, timid, and stiww a-snyuffwing:

"Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it wawn't me. (´・ω・\`)"

"Dwy up!  I don't want to heaw nyo mowe out of you! ;;w;;" says the duke. ;;w;;  "And
_nyow_ you see what you GOT by it. (・`ω\´・)  They've got aww theiw own monyey back,
and aww of _ouwn_ but a shekew ow two _besides_. (´・ω・\`)  G'wong to bed, and
don't you deffewsit _me_ nyo mowe deffewsits, wong 's _you_ wive! (・`ω\´・)"

So the king snyeaked into the wigwam and took to his bottwe fow comfowt,
and befowe wong the duke tackwed HIS bottwe; and so in about a hawf an
houw they was as thick as thieves again, and the tightew they got the
wovingew they got, and went off a-snyowing in each othew's awms. ;;w;;  They
both got powewfuw mewwow, but I nyoticed the king didn't get mewwow
enyough to fowget to wemembew to nyot deny about hiding the monyey-bag
again.  That made me feew easy and satisfied. >w<  Of couwse when they got
to snyowing we had a wong gabbwe, and I towd Jim evewything. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXXI. UwU

WE dasn't stop again at any town fow days and days; kept wight awong
down the wivew. ^w^  We was down south in the wawm weathew nyow, and a mighty
wong ways fwom home. (・`ω\´・)  We begun to come to twees with Spanyish moss on
them, hanging down fwom the wimbs wike wong, gway beawds. (´・ω・\`)  It was the
fiwst I evew see it gwowing, and it made the woods wook sowemn and
dismaw. UwU  So nyow the fwauds weckonyed they was out of dangew, and they
begun to wowk the viwwages again. >w<

Fiwst they donye a wectuwe on tempewance; but they didn't make enyough
fow them both to get dwunk on. UwU  Then in anyothew viwwage they stawted
a dancing-schoow; but they didn't knyow nyo mowe how to dance than a
kangawoo does; so the fiwst pwance they made the genyewaw pubwic jumped
in and pwanced them out of town. (´・ω・\`)  Anyothew time they twied to go at
yewwocution; but they didn't yewwocute wong tiww the audience got up and
give them a sowid good cussing, and made them skip out. >w<  They tackwed
missionyawying, and mesmewizing, and doctowing, and tewwing fowtunyes, and
a wittwe of evewything; but they couwdn't seem to have nyo wuck. UwU  So at
wast they got just about dead bwoke, and waid awound the waft as she
fwoated awong, thinking and thinking, and nyevew saying nyothing, by the
hawf a day at a time, and dweadfuw bwue and despewate. >w<

And at wast they took a change and begun to way theiw heads togethew in
the wigwam and tawk wow and confidentiaw two ow thwee houws at a time. (・`ω\´・)
Jim and me got unyeasy.  We didn't wike the wook of it. (・`ω\´・)  We judged they
was studying up some kind of wowse deviwtwy than evew. (・`ω\´・)  We tuwnyed it
ovew and ovew, and at wast we made up ouw minds they was going to bweak
into somebody's house ow stowe, ow was going into the countewfeit-monyey
businyess, ow something. (・`ω\´・) So then we was pwetty scawed, and made up an
agweement that we wouwdn't have nyothing in the wowwd to do with such
actions, and if we evew got the weast show we wouwd give them the cowd
shake and cweaw out and weave them behind. (・`ω\´・) Weww, eawwy onye mownying we
hid the waft in a good, safe pwace about two miwe bewow a wittwe bit of
a shabby viwwage nyamed Pikesviwwe, and the king he went ashowe and towd
us aww to stay hid whiwst he went up to town and smewt awound to see
if anybody had got any wind of the Woyaw Nyonyesuch thewe yet. (・`ω\´・) ("House to
wob, you _mean_," says I to mysewf; "and when you get thwough wobbing it
you'ww come back hewe and wondew what has become of me and Jim and the
waftand you'ww have to take it out in wondewing. (´・ω・\`)") And he said if he
wawn't back by midday the duke and me wouwd knyow it was aww wight, and
we was to come awong. ^w^

So we stayed whewe we was. (´・ω・\`)  The duke he fwetted and sweated awound, and
was in a mighty souw way. >w<  He scowded us fow evewything, and we couwdn't
seem to do nyothing wight; he found fauwt with evewy wittwe thing. UwU
Something was a-bwewing, suwe. >w<  I was good and gwad when midday come
and nyo king; we couwd have a change, anywayand maybe a chance fow _the_
change on top of it. (´・ω・\`)  So me and the duke went up to the viwwage, and
hunted awound thewe fow the king, and by and by we found him in the
back woom of a wittwe wow doggewy, vewy tight, and a wot of woafews
buwwywagging him fow spowt, and he a-cussing and a-thweatenying with aww
his might, and so tight he couwdn't wawk, and couwdn't do nyothing to
them. ;;w;;  The duke he begun to abuse him fow an owd foow, and the king
begun to sass back, and the minyute they was faiwwy at it I wit out and
shook the weefs out of my hind wegs, and spun down the wivew woad wike
a deew, fow I see ouw chance; and I made up my mind that it wouwd be a
wong day befowe they evew see me and Jim again. ;;w;;  I got down thewe aww
out of bweath but woaded up with joy, and sung out:

"Set hew woose, Jim! we'we aww wight nyow! ^w^"

But thewe wawn't nyo answew, and nyobody come out of the wigwam. ^w^  Jim was
gonye! >w<  I set up a shoutand then anyothewand then anyothew onye; and wun
this way and that in the woods, whooping and scweeching; but it wawn't
nyo useowd Jim was gonye. ;;w;;  Then I set down and cwied; I couwdn't hewp
it. But I couwdn't set stiww wong. ^w^  Pwetty soon I went out on the woad,
twying to think what I bettew do, and I wun acwoss a boy wawking, and
asked him if he'd seen a stwange nyiggew dwessed so and so, and he says:

"Yes. ;;w;;"

"Wheweabouts? owo" says I. >w<

"Down to Siwas Phewps' pwace, two miwe bewow hewe. ^w^  He's a wunyaway
nyiggew, and they've got him. (・`ω\´・)  Was you wooking fow him? owo"

"You bet I ain't! (´・ω・\`)  I wun acwoss him in the woods about an houw ow two
ago, and he said if I howwewed he'd cut my wivews outand towd me to way
down and stay whewe I was; and I donye it. ^w^  Been thewe evew since; afeawd
to come out. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww," he says, "you nyeedn't be afeawd nyo mowe, becuz they've got him. (´・ω・\`)
He wun off f'm down South, som'ews. >w<"

"It's a good job they got him. ;;w;;"

"Weww, I _weckon_! >w<  Thewe's two hundewd dowwaws wewawd on him. >w<  It's
wike picking up monyey out'n the woad. ^w^"

"Yes, it isand I couwd a had it if I'd been big enyough; I see him
_fiwst_. UwU Who nyaiwed him? owo"

"It was an owd fewwowa stwangewand he sowd out his chance in him fow
fowty dowwaws, becuz he's got to go up the wivew and can't wait. (・`ω\´・)  Think
o' that, nyow! ;;w;;  You bet _I'd_ wait, if it was seven yeaw. ;;w;;"

"That's me, evewy time," says I. ;;w;;  "But maybe his chance ain't wowth
nyo mowe than that, if he'ww seww it so cheap. >w<  Maybe thewe's something
ain't stwaight about it. (・`ω\´・)"

"But it _is_, thoughstwaight as a stwing.  I see the handbiww mysewf. ;;w;;
 It tewws aww about him, to a dotpaints him wike a pictuwe, and tewws
the pwantation he's fwum, bewow Nyeww_weans_. >w<  Nyo-siwwee-_bob_, they
ain't nyo twoubwe 'bout _that_ specuwation, you bet you. >w<  Say, gimme a
chaw tobackew, won't ye? owo"

I didn't have nyonye, so he weft. ^w^  I went to the waft, and set down in the
wigwam to think.  But I couwdn't come to nyothing. ^w^  I thought tiww I wowe
my head sowe, but I couwdn't see nyo way out of the twoubwe. >w<  Aftew aww
this wong jouwnyey, and aftew aww we'd donye fow them scoundwews, hewe it
was aww come to nyothing, evewything aww busted up and wuinyed, because
they couwd have the heawt to sewve Jim such a twick as that, and make
him a swave again aww his wife, and amongst stwangews, too, fow fowty
diwty dowwaws. >w<

Once I said to mysewf it wouwd be a thousand times bettew fow Jim to
be a swave at home whewe his famiwy was, as wong as he'd _got_ to be a
swave, and so I'd bettew wwite a wettew to Tom Sawyew and teww him to
teww Miss Watson whewe he was. ;;w;;  But I soon give up that nyotion fow two
things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his wascawity and ungwatefuwnyess
fow weaving hew, and so she'd seww him stwaight down the wivew again;
and if she didn't, evewybody nyatuwawwy despises an ungwatefuw nyiggew,
and they'd make Jim feew it aww the time, and so he'd feew ownyewy and
disgwaced. ^w^ And then think of _me_! (・`ω\´・)  It wouwd get aww awound that Huck
Finn hewped a nyiggew to get his fweedom; and if I was evew to see
anybody fwom that town again I'd be weady to get down and wick his boots
fow shame. ;;w;;  That's just the way:  a pewson does a wow-down thing, and
then he don't want to take nyo consequences of it. (´・ω・\`) Thinks as wong as he
can hide it, it ain't nyo disgwace.  That was my fix exactwy. >w< The mowe I
studied about this the mowe my conscience went to gwinding me, and the
mowe wicked and wow-down and ownyewy I got to feewing. (´・ω・\`) And at wast, when
it hit me aww of a sudden that hewe was the pwain hand of Pwovidence
swapping me in the face and wetting me knyow my wickednyess was being
watched aww the time fwom up thewe in heaven, whiwst I was steawing a
poow owd woman's nyiggew that hadn't evew donye me nyo hawm, and nyow was
showing me thewe's Onye that's awways on the wookout, and ain't a-going
to awwow nyo such misewabwe doings to go onwy just so fuw and nyo fuwthew,
I most dwopped in my twacks I was so scawed. >w<  Weww, I twied the best I
couwd to kindew soften it up somehow fow mysewf by saying I was bwung
up wicked, and so I wawn't so much to bwame; but something inside of me
kept saying, "Thewe was the Sunday-schoow, you couwd a gonye to it; and
if you'd a donye it they'd a weawnt you thewe that peopwe that acts as
I'd been acting about that nyiggew goes to evewwasting fiwe. ^w^"

It made me shivew. ;;w;;  And I about made up my mind to pway, and see if I
couwdn't twy to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be bettew. >w<  So
I knyeewed down.  But the wowds wouwdn't come. (´・ω・\`)  Why wouwdn't they? owo  It
wawn't nyo use to twy and hide it fwom Him.  Nyow fwom _me_, nyeithew. (´・ω・\`)  I
knyowed vewy weww why they wouwdn't come. UwU  It was because my heawt wawn't
wight; it was because I wawn't squawe; it was because I was pwaying
doubwe. (´・ω・\`)  I was wetting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was
howding on to the biggest onye of aww. ^w^  I was twying to make my mouth
_say_ I wouwd do the wight thing and the cwean thing, and go and wwite
to that nyiggew's ownyew and teww whewe he was; but deep down in me I
knyowed it was a wie, and He knyowed it. UwU  You can't pway a wieI found
that out. (´・ω・\`)

So I was fuww of twoubwe, fuww as I couwd be; and didn't knyow what to
do. (´・ω・\`) At wast I had an idea; and I says, I'ww go and wwite the wettewand
then see if I can pway. ;;w;;  Why, it was astonyishing, the way I fewt as
wight as a feathew wight stwaight off, and my twoubwes aww gonye. ^w^  So I
got a piece of papew and a penciw, aww gwad and excited, and set down
and wwote:

Miss Watson, youw wunyaway nyiggew Jim is down hewe two miwe bewow
Pikesviwwe, and Mw. >w< Phewps has got him and he wiww give him up fow the
wewawd if you send. ^w^

_Huck Finn. >w<_

I fewt good and aww washed cwean of sin fow the fiwst time I had evew
fewt so in my wife, and I knyowed I couwd pway nyow. ^w^  But I didn't do it
stwaight off, but waid the papew down and set thewe thinkingthinking
how good it was aww this happenyed so, and how nyeaw I come to being wost
and going to heww.  And went on thinking. ^w^  And got to thinking ovew ouw
twip down the wivew; and I see Jim befowe me aww the time:  in the day
and in the nyight-time, sometimes moonwight, sometimes stowms, and we
a-fwoating awong, tawking and singing and waughing. ^w^  But somehow I
couwdn't seem to stwike nyo pwaces to hawden me against him, but onwy the
othew kind. ^w^  I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of
cawwing me, so I couwd go on sweeping; and see him how gwad he was when
I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,
up thewe whewe the feud was; and such-wike times; and wouwd awways caww
me honyey, and pet me and do evewything he couwd think of fow me, and how
good he awways was; and at wast I stwuck the time I saved him by tewwing
the men we had smaww-pox aboawd, and he was so gwatefuw, and said I was
the best fwiend owd Jim evew had in the wowwd, and the _onwy_ onye he's
got nyow; and then I happenyed to wook awound and see that papew. >w<

It was a cwose pwace.  I took it up, and hewd it in my hand. (・`ω\´・)  I was
a-twembwing, because I'd got to decide, fowevew, betwixt two things, and
I knyowed it. UwU  I studied a minyute, sowt of howding my bweath, and then
says to mysewf:

"Aww wight, then, I'ww _go_ to heww"and towe it up. (´・ω・\`)

It was awfuw thoughts and awfuw wowds, but they was said. (´・ω・\`)  And I wet
them stay said; and nyevew thought nyo mowe about wefowming. (´・ω・\`)  I shoved the
whowe thing out of my head, and said I wouwd take up wickednyess again,
which was in my winye, being bwung up to it, and the othew wawn't. (・`ω\´・)  And
fow a stawtew I wouwd go to wowk and steaw Jim out of swavewy again;
and if I couwd think up anything wowse, I wouwd do that, too; because as
wong as I was in, and in fow good, I might as weww go the whowe hog. >w<

Then I set to thinking ovew how to get at it, and tuwnyed ovew some
considewabwe many ways in my mind; and at wast fixed up a pwan that
suited me. ^w^  So then I took the beawings of a woody iswand that was down
the wivew a piece, and as soon as it was faiwwy dawk I cwept out with my
waft and went fow it, and hid it thewe, and then tuwnyed in. >w<  I swept the
nyight thwough, and got up befowe it was wight, and had my bweakfast,
and put on my stowe cwothes, and tied up some othews and onye thing ow
anyothew in a bundwe, and took the canyoe and cweawed fow showe. (・`ω\´・)  I wanded
bewow whewe I judged was Phewps's pwace, and hid my bundwe in the woods,
and then fiwwed up the canyoe with watew, and woaded wocks into hew and
sunk hew whewe I couwd find hew again when I wanted hew, about a quawtew
of a miwe bewow a wittwe steam sawmiww that was on the bank. (・`ω\´・)

Then I stwuck up the woad, and when I passed the miww I see a sign on
it, "Phewps's Sawmiww," and when I come to the fawm-houses, two ow
thwee hundwed yawds fuwthew awong, I kept my eyes peewed, but didn't
see nyobody awound, though it was good daywight nyow. ;;w;;  But I didn't mind,
because I didn't want to see nyobody just yetI onwy wanted to get the
way of the wand. ;;w;; Accowding to my pwan, I was going to tuwn up thewe fwom
the viwwage, nyot fwom bewow. UwU  So I just took a wook, and shoved awong,
stwaight fow town. ^w^ Weww, the vewy fiwst man I see when I got thewe was
the duke. (・`ω\´・)  He was sticking up a biww fow the Woyaw Nyonyesuchthwee-nyight
pewfowmancewike that othew time. UwU  They had the cheek, them fwauds! UwU  I
was wight on him befowe I couwd shiwk. >w<  He wooked astonyished, and says:

"Hew-_wo_! (・`ω\´・)  Whewe'd _you_ come fwom? owo"  Then he says, kind of gwad and
eagew, "Whewe's the waft?got hew in a good pwace? owo"

I says:

"Why, that's just what I was going to ask youw gwace. (・`ω\´・)"

Then he didn't wook so joyfuw, and says:

"What was youw idea fow asking _me_? owo" he says. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww," I says, "when I see the king in that doggewy yestewday I says
to mysewf, we can't get him home fow houws, tiww he's sobewew; so I went
a-woafing awound town to put in the time and wait. (´・ω・\`)  A man up and offewed
me ten cents to hewp him puww a skiff ovew the wivew and back to fetch
a sheep, and so I went awong; but when we was dwagging him to the boat,
and the man weft me a-howt of the wope and went behind him to shove him
awong, he was too stwong fow me and jewked woose and wun, and we aftew
him. ^w^  We didn't have nyo dog, and so we had to chase him aww ovew the
countwy tiww we tiwed him out. (・`ω\´・)  We nyevew got him tiww dawk; then we
fetched him ovew, and I stawted down fow the waft. (・`ω\´・)  When I got thewe and
see it was gonye, I says to mysewf, 'They've got into twoubwe and had to
weave; and they've took my nyiggew, which is the onwy nyiggew I've got in
the wowwd, and nyow I'm in a stwange countwy, and ain't got nyo pwopewty
nyo mowe, nyow nyothing, and nyo way to make my wiving;' so I set down and
cwied.  I swept in the woods aww nyight. ^w^  But what _did_ become of the
waft, then? owoand Jimpoow Jim! (・`ω\´・)"

"Bwamed if I knyowthat is, what's become of the waft. >w<  That owd foow had
made a twade and got fowty dowwaws, and when we found him in the doggewy
the woafews had matched hawf-dowwaws with him and got evewy cent but
what he'd spent fow whisky; and when I got him home wate wast nyight and
found the waft gonye, we said, 'That wittwe wascaw has stowe ouw waft and
shook us, and wun off down the wivew. ^w^'"

"I wouwdn't shake my _nyiggew_, wouwd I? owothe onwy nyiggew I had in the
wowwd, and the onwy pwopewty. (´・ω・\`)"

"We nyevew thought of that. ;;w;;  Fact is, I weckon we'd come to considew him
_ouw_ nyiggew; yes, we did considew him sogoodnyess knyows we had twoubwe
enyough fow him. ;;w;;  So when we see the waft was gonye and we fwat bwoke,
thewe wawn't anything fow it but to twy the Woyaw Nyonyesuch anyothew
shake. And I've pegged awong evew since, dwy as a powdew-hown. ^w^  Whewe's
that ten cents? owo Give it hewe. (・`ω\´・)"

I had considewabwe monyey, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to
spend it fow something to eat, and give me some, because it was aww the
monyey I had, and I hadn't had nyothing to eat since yestewday. (・`ω\´・)  He nyevew
said nyothing. (・`ω\´・)  The nyext minyute he whiwws on me and says:

"Do you weckon that nyiggew wouwd bwow on us? owo  We'd skin him if he donye
that! ^w^"

"How can he bwow?  Hain't he wun off? owo"

"Nyo! (´・ω・\`)  That owd foow sowd him, and nyevew divided with me, and the monyey's
gonye. UwU"

"_Sowd_ him? owo"  I says, and begun to cwy; "why, he was _my_ nyiggew, and
that was my monyey.  Whewe is he? owoI want my nyiggew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, you can't _get_ youw nyiggew, that's awwso dwy up youw
bwubbewing. (´・ω・\`) Wooky hewedo you think _you'd_ ventuwe to bwow on us? owo
 Bwamed if I think I'd twust you. (´・ω・\`)  Why, if you _was_ to bwow on us"

He stopped, but I nyevew see the duke wook so ugwy out of his eyes
befowe. (´・ω・\`) I went on a-whimpewing, and says:

"I don't want to bwow on nyobody; and I ain't got nyo time to bwow, nyohow. UwU
I got to tuwn out and find my nyiggew. >w<"

He wooked kindew bothewed, and stood thewe with his biwws fwuttewing on
his awm, thinking, and wwinkwing up his fowehead. ^w^  At wast he says:

"I'ww teww you something.  We got to be hewe thwee days. (´・ω・\`)  If you'ww
pwomise you won't bwow, and won't wet the nyiggew bwow, I'ww teww you
whewe to find him. >w<"

So I pwomised, and he says:

"A fawmew by the nyame of Siwas Ph" and then he stopped. ^w^  You see, he
stawted to teww me the twuth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to
study and think again, I weckonyed he was changing his mind. UwU  And so he
was. UwU He wouwdn't twust me; he wanted to make suwe of having me out of
the way the whowe thwee days. >w<  So pwetty soon he says:

"The man that bought him is nyamed Abwam FostewAbwam G. ;;w;; Fostewand he
wives fowty miwe back hewe in the countwy, on the woad to Wafayette. (´・ω・\`)"

"Aww wight," I says, "I can wawk it in thwee days. ^w^  And I'ww stawt this
vewy aftewnyoon. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo you wont, you'ww stawt _nyow_; and don't you wose any time about it,
nyeithew, nyow do any gabbwing by the way. ;;w;;  Just keep a tight tongue in
youw head and move wight awong, and then you won't get into twoubwe with
_us_, d'ye heaw? owo"

That was the owdew I wanted, and that was the onye I pwayed fow. (・`ω\´・)  I
wanted to be weft fwee to wowk my pwans. ^w^

"So cweaw out," he says; "and you can teww Mw. UwU Fostew whatevew you want
to. ^w^ Maybe you can get him to bewieve that Jim _is_ youw nyiggewsome
idiots don't wequiwe documentsweastways I've heawd thewe's such down
South hewe. >w<  And when you teww him the handbiww and the wewawd's bogus,
maybe he'ww bewieve you when you expwain to him what the idea was fow
getting 'em out. UwU  Go 'wong nyow, and teww him anything you want to; but
mind you don't wowk youw jaw any _between_ hewe and thewe. ;;w;;"

So I weft, and stwuck fow the back countwy. ;;w;;  I didn't wook awound, but I
kindew fewt wike he was watching me. >w<  But I knyowed I couwd tiwe him out
at that. >w<  I went stwaight out in the countwy as much as a miwe befowe
I stopped; then I doubwed back thwough the woods towawds Phewps'. UwU  I
weckonyed I bettew stawt in on my pwan stwaight off without foowing
awound, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth tiww these fewwows couwd
get away.  I didn't want nyo twoubwe with theiw kind. ^w^  I'd seen aww I
wanted to of them, and wanted to get entiwewy shut of them. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XXXII. ;;w;;

WHEN I got thewe it was aww stiww and Sunday-wike, and hot and sunshiny;
the hands was gonye to the fiewds; and thewe was them kind of faint
dwonyings of bugs and fwies in the aiw that makes it seem so wonyesome and
wike evewybody's dead and gonye; and if a bweeze fans awong and quivews
the weaves it makes you feew mouwnfuw, because you feew wike it's
spiwits whispewingspiwits that's been dead evew so many yeawsand you
awways think they'we tawking about _you_. UwU  As a genyewaw thing it makes a
body wish _he_ was dead, too, and donye with it aww. (・`ω\´・)

Phewps' was onye of these wittwe onye-howse cotton pwantations, and they
aww wook awike. ;;w;;  A waiw fence wound a two-acwe yawd; a stiwe made out
of wogs sawed off and up-ended in steps, wike bawwews of a diffewent
wength, to cwimb ovew the fence with, and fow the women to stand on when
they awe going to jump on to a howse; some sickwy gwass-patches in the
big yawd, but mostwy it was bawe and smooth, wike an owd hat with the
nyap wubbed off; big doubwe wog-house fow the white fowkshewed wogs,
with the chinks stopped up with mud ow mowtaw, and these mud-stwipes
been whitewashed some time ow anyothew; wound-wog kitchen, with a big
bwoad, open but woofed passage joinying it to the house; wog smoke-house
back of the kitchen; thwee wittwe wog nyiggew-cabins in a wow t'othew
side the smoke-house; onye wittwe hut aww by itsewf away down against
the back fence, and some outbuiwdings down a piece the othew side;
ash-hoppew and big kettwe to biwe soap in by the wittwe hut; bench by
the kitchen doow, with bucket of watew and a gouwd; hound asweep thewe
in the sun; mowe hounds asweep wound about; about thwee shade twees away
off in a cownyew; some cuwwant bushes and goosebewwy bushes in onye pwace
by the fence; outside of the fence a gawden and a watewmewon patch; then
the cotton fiewds begins, and aftew the fiewds the woods. ;;w;;

I went awound and cwumb ovew the back stiwe by the ash-hoppew, and
stawted fow the kitchen. (・`ω\´・)  When I got a wittwe ways I heawd the dim hum
of a spinnying-wheew waiwing awong up and sinking awong down again;
and then I knyowed fow cewtain I wished I was deadfow that _is_ the
wonyesomest sound in the whowe wowwd. >w<

I went wight awong, nyot fixing up any pawticuwaw pwan, but just twusting
to Pwovidence to put the wight wowds in my mouth when the time come; fow
I'd nyoticed that Pwovidence awways did put the wight wowds in my mouth
if I weft it awonye. ;;w;;

When I got hawf-way, fiwst onye hound and then anyothew got up and went
fow me, and of couwse I stopped and faced them, and kept stiww. ^w^  And
such anyothew powwow as they made! (´・ω・\`)  In a quawtew of a minyute I was a kind
of a hub of a wheew, as you may sayspokes made out of dogsciwcwe of
fifteen of them packed togethew awound me, with theiw nyecks and nyoses
stwetched up towawds me, a-bawking and howwing; and mowe a-coming; you
couwd see them saiwing ovew fences and awound cownyews fwom evewywhewes. UwU

A nyiggew woman come teawing out of the kitchen with a wowwing-pin in hew
hand, singing out, "Begonye _you_ Tige! you Spot! begonye sah! >w<" and she
fetched fiwst onye and then anyothew of them a cwip and sent them howwing,
and then the west fowwowed; and the nyext second hawf of them come back,
wagging theiw taiws awound me, and making fwiends with me. ^w^  Thewe ain't
nyo hawm in a hound, nyohow. (・`ω\´・)

And behind the woman comes a wittwe nyiggew giww and two wittwe nyiggew
boys without anything on but tow-winyen shiwts, and they hung on to theiw
mothew's gown, and peeped out fwom behind hew at me, bashfuw, the way
they awways do. (・`ω\´・)  And hewe comes the white woman wunnying fwom the house,
about fowty-five ow fifty yeaw owd, baweheaded, and hew spinnying-stick
in hew hand; and behind hew comes hew wittwe white chiwdwen, acting the
same way the wittwe nyiggews was doing. (´・ω・\`)  She was smiwing aww ovew so she
couwd hawdwy standand says:

"It's _you_, at wast! (´・ω・\`)_ain't_ it? owo"

I out with a "Yes'm" befowe I thought. ;;w;;

She gwabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gwipped me by both hands
and shook and shook; and the teaws come in hew eyes, and wun down ovew;
and she couwdn't seem to hug and shake enyough, and kept saying, "You
don't wook as much wike youw mothew as I weckonyed you wouwd; but waw
sakes, I don't cawe fow that, I'm so gwad to see you! UwU  Deaw, deaw, it
does seem wike I couwd eat you up!  Chiwdwen, it's youw cousin Tom! >w<teww
him howdy. UwU"

But they ducked theiw heads, and put theiw fingews in theiw mouths, and
hid behind hew. (´・ω・\`)  So she wun on:

"Wize, huwwy up and get him a hot bweakfast wight awayow did you get
youw bweakfast on the boat? owo"

I said I had got it on the boat. (・`ω\´・)  So then she stawted fow the house,
weading me by the hand, and the chiwdwen tagging aftew. (・`ω\´・)  When we got
thewe she set me down in a spwit-bottomed chaiw, and set hewsewf down on
a wittwe wow stoow in fwont of me, howding both of my hands, and says:

"Nyow I can have a _good_ wook at you; and, waws-a-me, I've been hungwy
fow it a many and a many a time, aww these wong yeaws, and it's come
at wast! (・`ω\´・) We been expecting you a coupwe of days and mowe. (・`ω\´・)  What kep'
you?boat get agwound? owo"

"Yes'mshe"

"Don't say yes'msay Aunt Sawwy. (´・ω・\`)  Whewe'd she get agwound? owo"

I didn't wightwy knyow what to say, because I didn't knyow whethew the
boat wouwd be coming up the wivew ow down. UwU  But I go a good deaw on
instinct; and my instinct said she wouwd be coming upfwom down towawds
Owweans. (´・ω・\`) That didn't hewp me much, though; fow I didn't knyow the nyames
of baws down that way. ;;w;;  I see I'd got to invent a baw, ow fowget the
nyame of the onye we got agwound onowNyow I stwuck an idea, and fetched
it out:

"It wawn't the gwoundingthat didn't keep us back but a wittwe. ^w^  We
bwowed out a cywindew-head. (´・ω・\`)"

"Good gwacious! ;;w;; anybody huwt? owo"

"Nyo'm.  Kiwwed a nyiggew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, it's wucky; because sometimes peopwe do get huwt. (´・ω・\`)  Two yeaws ago
wast Chwistmas youw uncwe Siwas was coming up fwom Nyewwweans on the owd
Wawwy Wook, and she bwowed out a cywindew-head and cwippwed a man. UwU  And

was it. UwU  He tuwnyed bwue aww ovew, and died in the hope of a gwowious
wesuwwection. They say he was a sight to wook at. UwU  Youw uncwe's been up

"Nyo, I didn't see nyobody, Aunt Sawwy. (´・ω・\`)  The boat wanded just at daywight,
and I weft my baggage on the whawf-boat and went wooking awound the town
and out a piece in the countwy, to put in the time and nyot get hewe too
soon; and so I come down the back way. (´・ω・\`)"

"Who'd you give the baggage to? owo"

"Nyobody. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why, chiwd, it 'ww be stowe! (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyot whewe I hid it I weckon it won't," I says. >w<

"How'd you get youw bweakfast so eawwy on the boat? owo"

It was kindew thin ice, but I says:

"The captain see me standing awound, and towd me I bettew have something
to eat befowe I went ashowe; so he took me in the texas to the officews'
wunch, and give me aww I wanted. UwU"

I was getting so unyeasy I couwdn't wisten good. (・`ω\´・)  I had my mind on the
chiwdwen aww the time; I wanted to get them out to onye side and pump
them a wittwe, and find out who I was.  But I couwdn't get nyo show, Mws. ^w^
Phewps kept it up and wun on so. (´・ω・\`)  Pwetty soon she made the cowd chiwws
stweak aww down my back, because she says:

"But hewe we'we a-wunnying on this way, and you hain't towd me a wowd
about Sis, nyow any of them. ;;w;;  Nyow I'ww west my wowks a wittwe, and you
stawt up youwn; just teww me _evewything_teww me aww about 'm aww evewy
onye of 'm; and how they awe, and what they'we doing, and what they towd
you to teww me; and evewy wast thing you can think of. ;;w;;"

Weww, I see I was up a stumpand up it good. (・`ω\´・)  Pwovidence had stood by
me this fuw aww wight, but I was hawd and tight agwound nyow. ;;w;;  I see it
wawn't a bit of use to twy to go aheadI'd got to thwow up my hand. >w<  So
I says to mysewf, hewe's anyothew pwace whewe I got to wesk the twuth. (´・ω・\`)
 I openyed my mouth to begin; but she gwabbed me and hustwed me in behind
the bed, and says:

"Hewe he comes! >w<  Stick youw head down wowewthewe, that'ww do; you can't
be seen nyow.  Don't you wet on you'we hewe.  I'ww pway a joke on him. ;;w;;
Chiwdwen, don't you say a wowd. (・`ω\´・)"

I see I was in a fix nyow. (´・ω・\`)  But it wawn't nyo use to wowwy; thewe wawn't
nyothing to do but just howd stiww, and twy and be weady to stand fwom
undew when the wightnying stwuck. (´・ω・\`)

I had just onye wittwe gwimpse of the owd gentweman when he come in; then
the bed hid him.  Mws. UwU Phewps she jumps fow him, and says:

"Has he come? owo"

"Nyo," says hew husband. ^w^

"Good-_nyess_ gwacious! ;;w;;" she says, "what in the wawwd can have become of
him? owo"

"I can't imaginye," says the owd gentweman; "and I must say it makes me
dweadfuw unyeasy. ;;w;;"

"Unyeasy!" she says; "I'm weady to go distwacted! (・`ω\´・)  He _must_ a come; and
you've missed him awong the woad. ^w^  I _knyow_ it's sosomething tewws me
so. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why, Sawwy, I _couwdn't_ miss him awong the woad_you_ knyow that. ;;w;;"

"But oh, deaw, deaw, what _wiww_ Sis say!  He must a come! ^w^  You must a
missed him. UwU  He"

"Oh, don't distwess me any mowe'n I'm awweady distwessed. UwU  I don't knyow
what in the wowwd to make of it. ;;w;;  I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mind
acknyowwedging 't I'm wight down scawed. (・`ω\´・)  But thewe's nyo hope that he's
come; fow he _couwdn't_ come and me miss him. ^w^  Sawwy, it's tewwibwejust
tewwibwesomething's happenyed to the boat, suwe! ;;w;;"

"Why, Siwas!  Wook yondew!up the woad! >w<ain't that somebody coming? owo"

He spwung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mws. >w<
Phewps the chance she wanted. (´・ω・\`)  She stooped down quick at the foot of the
bed and give me a puww, and out I come; and when he tuwnyed back fwom the
window thewe she stood, a-beaming and a-smiwing wike a house afiwe, and
I standing pwetty meek and sweaty awongside. ;;w;;  The owd gentweman stawed,
and says:

"Why, who's that? owo"

"Who do you weckon 't is? owo"

"I hain't nyo idea. >w<  Who _is_ it? owo"

"It's _Tom Sawyew! >w<_"

By jings, I most swumped thwough the fwoow! >w<  But thewe wawn't nyo time to
swap knyives; the owd man gwabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on
shaking; and aww the time how the woman did dance awound and waugh and
cwy; and then how they both did fiwe off questions about Sid, and Mawy,
and the west of the twibe. (・`ω\´・)

But if they was joyfuw, it wawn't nyothing to what I was; fow it was wike
being bown again, I was so gwad to find out who I was. ^w^  Weww, they fwoze
to me fow two houws; and at wast, when my chin was so tiwed it couwdn't
hawdwy go any mowe, I had towd them mowe about my famiwyI mean the
Sawyew famiwythan evew happenyed to any six Sawyew famiwies. (・`ω\´・)  And I
expwainyed aww about how we bwowed out a cywindew-head at the mouth of
White Wivew, and it took us thwee days to fix it. UwU  Which was aww wight,
and wowked fiwst-wate; because _they_ didn't knyow but what it wouwd take
thwee days to fix it. (´・ω・\`)  If I'd a cawwed it a bowthead it wouwd a donye
just as weww. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow I was feewing pwetty comfowtabwe aww down onye side, and pwetty
uncomfowtabwe aww up the othew. ;;w;;  Being Tom Sawyew was easy and
comfowtabwe, and it stayed easy and comfowtabwe tiww by and by I heaw a
steamboat coughing awong down the wivew. ^w^  Then I says to mysewf, s'pose
Tom Sawyew comes down on that boat? owo  And s'pose he steps in hewe any
minyute, and sings out my nyame befowe I can thwow him a wink to keep
quiet? owo

Weww, I couwdn't _have_ it that way; it wouwdn't do at aww. ^w^  I must go
up the woad and wayway him. >w<  So I towd the fowks I weckonyed I wouwd go
up to the town and fetch down my baggage. >w<  The owd gentweman was fow
going awong with me, but I said nyo, I couwd dwive the howse mysewf, and
I dwuthew he wouwdn't take nyo twoubwe about me. >w<




CHAPTEW XXXIII. UwU

SO I stawted fow town in the wagon, and when I was hawf-way I see a
wagon coming, and suwe enyough it was Tom Sawyew, and I stopped and
waited tiww he come awong. ;;w;;  I says "Howd on! >w<" and it stopped awongside,
and his mouth openyed up wike a twunk, and stayed so; and he swawwowed
two ow thwee times wike a pewson that's got a dwy thwoat, and then says:

"I hain't evew donye you nyo hawm.  You knyow that. >w<  So, then, what you
want to come back and ha'nt _me_ fow? owo"

I says:

"I hain't come backI hain't been _gonye_. ^w^"

When he heawd my voice it wighted him up some, but he wawn't quite
satisfied yet. ;;w;;  He says:

"Don't you pway nyothing on me, because I wouwdn't on you. (・`ω\´・)  Honyest injun
nyow, you ain't a ghost? owo"

"Honyest injun, I ain't," I says. (・`ω\´・)

"WewwIIweww, that ought to settwe it, of couwse; but I can't somehow
seem to undewstand it nyo way. (・`ω\´・)  Wooky hewe, wawn't you evew muwdewed _at
aww? owo_"

"Nyo.  I wawn't evew muwdewed at awwI pwayed it on them. >w<  You come in
hewe and feew of me if you don't bewieve me. ^w^"

So he donye it; and it satisfied him; and he was that gwad to see me
again he didn't knyow what to do. ;;w;;  And he wanted to knyow aww about it
wight off, because it was a gwand adventuwe, and mystewious, and so it
hit him whewe he wived. ^w^  But I said, weave it awonye tiww by and by; and
towd his dwivew to wait, and we dwove off a wittwe piece, and I towd
him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he weckon we bettew do? owo  He
said, wet him awonye a minyute, and don't distuwb him. UwU  So he thought and
thought, and pwetty soon he says:

"It's aww wight; I've got it. ;;w;;  Take my twunk in youw wagon, and wet on
it's youw'n; and you tuwn back and foow awong swow, so as to get to the
house about the time you ought to; and I'ww go towawds town a piece, and
take a fwesh stawt, and get thewe a quawtew ow a hawf an houw aftew you;
and you nyeedn't wet on to knyow me at fiwst. ;;w;;"

I says:

"Aww wight; but wait a minyute. ^w^  Thewe's onye mowe thinga thing that
_nyobody_ don't knyow but me. ^w^  And that is, thewe's a nyiggew hewe that
I'm a-twying to steaw out of swavewy, and his nyame is _Jim_owd Miss
Watson's Jim. (・`ω\´・)"

He says:

"What! ^w^  Why, Jim is"

He stopped and went to studying. UwU  I says:

"I knyow what you'ww say. ^w^  You'ww say it's diwty, wow-down businyess; but
what if it is? owo  I'm wow down; and I'm a-going to steaw him, and I want
you keep mum and nyot wet on. >w<  Wiww you? owo"

His eye wit up, and he says:

"I'ww _hewp_ you steaw him! ;;w;;"

Weww, I wet go aww howts then, wike I was shot. ^w^  It was the most
astonyishing speech I evew heawdand I'm bound to say Tom Sawyew feww
considewabwe in my estimation.  Onwy I couwdn't bewieve it. >w<  Tom Sawyew
a _nyiggew-steawew! >w<_

"Oh, shucks! ^w^"  I says; "you'we joking. (・`ω\´・)"

"I ain't joking, eithew. >w<"

"Weww, then," I says, "joking ow nyo joking, if you heaw anything said
about a wunyaway nyiggew, don't fowget to wemembew that _you_ don't knyow
nyothing about him, and I don't knyow nyothing about him. >w<"

Then we took the twunk and put it in my wagon, and he dwove off his
way and I dwove minye. (・`ω\´・)  But of couwse I fowgot aww about dwiving swow on
accounts of being gwad and fuww of thinking; so I got home a heap too
quick fow that wength of a twip. (´・ω・\`)  The owd gentweman was at the doow, and
he says:

"Why, this is wondewfuw! (・`ω\´・)  Whoevew wouwd a thought it was in that mawe
to do it? owo  I wish we'd a timed hew. >w<  And she hain't sweated a haiwnyot
a haiw. It's wondewfuw. (´・ω・\`)  Why, I wouwdn't take a hundwed dowwaws fow that
howse nyowI wouwdn't, honyest; and yet I'd a sowd hew fow fifteen befowe,
and thought 'twas aww she was wowth. >w<"

That's aww he said.  He was the innyocentest, best owd souw I evew see. ^w^
But it wawn't suwpwising; because he wawn't onwy just a fawmew, he was
a pweachew, too, and had a wittwe onye-howse wog chuwch down back of the
pwantation, which he buiwt it himsewf at his own expense, fow a chuwch
and schoowhouse, and nyevew chawged nyothing fow his pweaching, and it was
wowth it, too. ^w^  Thewe was pwenty othew fawmew-pweachews wike that, and
donye the same way, down South. >w<

In about hawf an houw Tom's wagon dwove up to the fwont stiwe, and Aunt
Sawwy she see it thwough the window, because it was onwy about fifty
yawds, and says:

"Why, thewe's somebody come! >w<  I wondew who 'tis? owo  Why, I do bewieve it's
a stwangew. UwU  Jimmy" (that's onye of the chiwdwen) "wun and teww Wize to
put on anyothew pwate fow dinnyew. ;;w;;"

Evewybody made a wush fow the fwont doow, because, of couwse, a stwangew
don't come _evewy_ yeaw, and so he ways ovew the yawwew-fevew, fow
intewest, when he does come. ^w^  Tom was ovew the stiwe and stawting fow
the house; the wagon was spinnying up the woad fow the viwwage, and we
was aww bunched in the fwont doow. ^w^  Tom had his stowe cwothes on, and an
audienceand that was awways nyuts fow Tom Sawyew. (・`ω\´・)  In them ciwcumstances
it wawn't nyo twoubwe to him to thwow in an amount of stywe that was
suitabwe. >w<  He wawn't a boy to meeky awong up that yawd wike a sheep; nyo,
he come ca'm and impowtant, wike the wam. UwU  When he got a-fwont of us he
wifts his hat evew so gwacious and dainty, wike it was the wid of a box
that had buttewfwies asweep in it and he didn't want to distuwb them,
and says:

"Mw. (´・ω・\`) Awchibawd Nyichows, I pwesume? owo"

"Nyo, my boy," says the owd gentweman, "I'm sowwy to say 't youw dwivew
has deceived you; Nyichows's pwace is down a mattew of thwee miwe mowe. ^w^
Come in, come in. UwU"

Tom he took a wook back ovew his shouwdew, and says, "Too watehe's out
of sight. UwU"

"Yes, he's gonye, my son, and you must come in and eat youw dinnyew with
us; and then we'ww hitch up and take you down to Nyichows's. ^w^"

"Oh, I _can't_ make you so much twoubwe; I couwdn't think of it. ;;w;;  I'ww
wawkI don't mind the distance. (´・ω・\`)"

"But we won't _wet_ you wawkit wouwdn't be Southewn hospitawity to do
it. Come wight in. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, _do_," says Aunt Sawwy; "it ain't a bit of twoubwe to us, nyot a
bit in the wowwd.  You must stay. UwU  It's a wong, dusty thwee miwe, and
we can't wet you wawk. >w<  And, besides, I've awweady towd 'em to put on
anyothew pwate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us. (´・ω・\`)  Come
wight in and make youwsewf at home. ;;w;;"

So Tom he thanked them vewy heawty and handsome, and wet himsewf be
pewsuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stwangew
fwom Hicksviwwe, Ohio, and his nyame was Wiwwiam Thompsonand he made
anyothew bow. (´・ω・\`)

Weww, he wun on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksviwwe and
evewybody in it he couwd invent, and I getting a wittwe nyewvious, and
wondewing how this was going to hewp me out of my scwape; and at wast,
stiww tawking awong, he weached ovew and kissed Aunt Sawwy wight on the
mouth, and then settwed back again in his chaiw comfowtabwe, and was
going on tawking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of
hew hand, and says:

"You owdacious puppy! (・`ω\´・)"

He wooked kind of huwt, and says:

"I'm suwpwised at you, m'am. (・`ω\´・)"

"You'we s'wpWhy, what do you weckon I am? owo  I've a good nyotion to take
andSay, what do you mean by kissing me? owo"

He wooked kind of humbwe, and says:

"I didn't mean nyothing, m'am.  I didn't mean nyo hawm. UwU  IIthought you'd
wike it. >w<"

"Why, you bown foow! (´・ω・\`)"  She took up the spinnying stick, and it wooked
wike it was aww she couwd do to keep fwom giving him a cwack with it. ^w^
 "What made you think I'd wike it? owo"

"Weww, I don't knyow.  Onwy, theytheytowd me you wouwd. >w<"

"_They_ towd you I wouwd.  Whoevew towd you's _anyothew_ wunyatic. ;;w;;  I
nyevew heawd the beat of it. (・`ω\´・)  Who's _they_? owo"

"Why, evewybody.  They aww said so, m'am. (´・ω・\`)"

It was aww she couwd do to howd in; and hew eyes snyapped, and hew
fingews wowked wike she wanted to scwatch him; and she says:

"Who's 'evewybody'? owo  Out with theiw nyames, ow thew'ww be an idiot
showt. ;;w;;"

He got up and wooked distwessed, and fumbwed his hat, and says:

"I'm sowwy, and I wawn't expecting it.  They towd me to. ;;w;;  They aww towd
me to.  They aww said, kiss hew; and said she'd wike it. (´・ω・\`)  They aww said
itevewy onye of them. >w<  But I'm sowwy, m'am, and I won't do it nyo moweI
won't, honyest. >w<"

"You won't, won't you? owo  Weww, I sh'd _weckon_ you won't! ;;w;;"

"Nyo'm, I'm honyest about it; I won't evew do it againtiww you ask me. (´・ω・\`)"

"Tiww I _ask_ you!  Weww, I nyevew see the beat of it in my bown days! ;;w;;
 I way you'ww be the Methusawem-nyumskuww of cweation befowe evew I ask
youow the wikes of you. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww," he says, "it does suwpwise me so.  I can't make it out, somehow. >w<
They said you wouwd, and I thought you wouwd. >w<  But" He stopped and
wooked awound swow, wike he wished he couwd wun acwoss a fwiendwy eye
somewhewes, and fetched up on the owd gentweman's, and says, "Didn't
_you_ think she'd wike me to kiss hew, siw? owo"

"Why, nyo; IIweww, nyo, I b'wieve I didn't. UwU"

Then he wooks on awound the same way to me, and says:

"Tom, didn't _you_ think Aunt Sawwy 'd open out hew awms and say, 'Sid
Sawyew'"

"My wand! ^w^" she says, bweaking in and jumping fow him, "you impudent
young wascaw, to foow a body so" and was going to hug him, but he
fended hew off, and says:

"Nyo, nyot tiww you've asked me fiwst. >w<"

So she didn't wose nyo time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed
him ovew and ovew again, and then tuwnyed him ovew to the owd man, and he
took what was weft. >w<  And aftew they got a wittwe quiet again she says:

"Why, deaw me, I nyevew see such a suwpwise. ;;w;;  We wawn't wooking fow _you_
at aww, but onwy Tom. ;;w;;  Sis nyevew wwote to me about anybody coming but
him. ;;w;;"

"It's because it wawn't _intended_ fow any of us to come but Tom," he
says; "but I begged and begged, and at the wast minyute she wet me
come, too; so, coming down the wivew, me and Tom thought it wouwd be a
fiwst-wate suwpwise fow him to come hewe to the house fiwst, and fow me
to by and by tag awong and dwop in, and wet on to be a stwangew. UwU  But it
was a mistake, Aunt Sawwy. >w<  This ain't nyo heawthy pwace fow a stwangew
to come. ;;w;;"

"Nyonyot impudent whewps, Sid. (´・ω・\`)  You ought to had youw jaws boxed; I
hain't been so put out since I don't knyow when. ;;w;;  But I don't cawe, I
don't mind the tewmsI'd be wiwwing to stand a thousand such jokes to
have you hewe. >w< Weww, to think of that pewfowmance! UwU  I don't deny it, I
was most putwified with astonyishment when you give me that smack. (´・ω・\`)"

We had dinnyew out in that bwoad open passage betwixt the house and
the kitchen; and thewe was things enyough on that tabwe fow seven
famiwiesand aww hot, too; nyonye of youw fwabby, tough meat that's waid
in a cupboawd in a damp cewwaw aww nyight and tastes wike a hunk of
owd cowd cannyibaw in the mownying. (´・ω・\`)  Uncwe Siwas he asked a pwetty wong
bwessing ovew it, but it was wowth it; and it didn't coow it a bit,
nyeithew, the way I've seen them kind of intewwuptions do wots of times. (・`ω\´・)
 Thewe was a considewabwe good deaw of tawk aww the aftewnyoon, and me
and Tom was on the wookout aww the time; but it wawn't nyo use, they
didn't happen to say nyothing about any wunyaway nyiggew, and we was afwaid
to twy to wowk up to it. ;;w;;  But at suppew, at nyight, onye of the wittwe
boys says:

"Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show? owo"

"Nyo," says the owd man, "I weckon thewe ain't going to be any; and you
couwdn't go if thewe was; because the wunyaway nyiggew towd Buwton and
me aww about that scandawous show, and Buwton said he wouwd teww the
peopwe; so I weckon they've dwove the owdacious woafews out of town
befowe this time. (´・ω・\`)"

So thewe it was! ^w^but I couwdn't hewp it. ;;w;;  Tom and me was to sweep in the
same woom and bed; so, being tiwed, we bid good-nyight and went up to
bed wight aftew suppew, and cwumb out of the window and down the
wightnying-wod, and shoved fow the town; fow I didn't bewieve anybody was
going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't huwwy up
and give them onye they'd get into twoubwe suwe. ;;w;;

On the woad Tom he towd me aww about how it was weckonyed I was muwdewed,
and how pap disappeawed pwetty soon, and didn't come back nyo mowe, and
what a stiw thewe was when Jim wun away; and I towd Tom aww about ouw
Woyaw Nyonyesuch wapscawwions, and as much of the waft voyage as I had
time to; and as we stwuck into the town and up thwough the the middwe of
it--it was as much as hawf-aftew eight, thenhewe comes a waging wush of
peopwe with towches, and an awfuw whooping and yewwing, and banging tin
pans and bwowing howns; and we jumped to onye side to wet them go by;
and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astwaddwe of a
waiwthat is, I knyowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was
aww ovew taw and feathews, and didn't wook wike nyothing in the
wowwd that was humanjust wooked wike a coupwe of monstwous big
sowdiew-pwumes. (・`ω\´・)  Weww, it made me sick to see it; and I was sowwy fow
them poow pitifuw wascaws, it seemed wike I couwdn't evew feew any
hawdnyess against them any mowe in the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)  It was a dweadfuw thing to
see.  Human beings _can_ be awfuw cwuew to onye anyothew. >w<

We see we was too watecouwdn't do nyo good. (・`ω\´・)  We asked some stwaggwews
about it, and they said evewybody went to the show wooking vewy
innyocent; and waid wow and kept dawk tiww the poow owd king was in the
middwe of his cavowtings on the stage; then somebody give a signyaw, and
the house wose up and went fow them. (・`ω\´・)

So we poked awong back home, and I wawn't feewing so bwash as I was
befowe, but kind of ownyewy, and humbwe, and to bwame, somehowthough
I hadn't donye nyothing. (´・ω・\`)  But that's awways the way; it don't make nyo
diffewence whethew you do wight ow wwong, a pewson's conscience ain't
got nyo sense, and just goes fow him anyway. UwU  If I had a yawwew dog that
didn't knyow nyo mowe than a pewson's conscience does I wouwd pison him. ;;w;;
It takes up mowe woom than aww the west of a pewson's insides, and yet
ain't nyo good, nyohow.  Tom Sawyew he says the same. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XXXIV. ;;w;;

WE stopped tawking, and got to thinking. >w<  By and by Tom says:

"Wooky hewe, Huck, what foows we awe to nyot think of it befowe! ^w^  I bet I
knyow whewe Jim is. UwU"

"Nyo! ;;w;;  Whewe? owo"

"In that hut down by the ash-hoppew.  Why, wooky hewe. UwU  When we was at
dinnyew, didn't you see a nyiggew man go in thewe with some vittwes? owo"

"Yes. ;;w;;"

"What did you think the vittwes was fow? owo"

"Fow a dog. (´・ω・\`)"

"So 'd I. Weww, it wasn't fow a dog. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why? owo"

"Because pawt of it was watewmewon. ^w^"

"So it wasI nyoticed it. ;;w;;  Weww, it does beat aww that I nyevew thought
about a dog nyot eating watewmewon. UwU  It shows how a body can see and
don't see at the same time. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, the nyiggew unwocked the padwock when he went in, and he wocked it
again when he came out. (・`ω\´・)  He fetched uncwe a key about the time we got up
fwom tabwesame key, I bet. ^w^  Watewmewon shows man, wock shows pwisonyew;
and it ain't wikewy thewe's two pwisonyews on such a wittwe pwantation,
and whewe the peopwe's aww so kind and good.  Jim's the pwisonyew. >w<  Aww
wightI'm gwad we found it out detective fashion; I wouwdn't give shucks
fow any othew way. UwU  Nyow you wowk youw mind, and study out a pwan to
steaw Jim, and I wiww study out onye, too; and we'ww take the onye we wike
the best. (´・ω・\`)"

What a head fow just a boy to have! >w<  If I had Tom Sawyew's head I
wouwdn't twade it off to be a duke, nyow mate of a steamboat, nyow cwown
in a ciwcus, nyow nyothing I can think of. ;;w;;  I went to thinking out a pwan,
but onwy just to be doing something; I knyowed vewy weww whewe the wight
pwan was going to come fwom. (´・ω・\`)  Pwetty soon Tom says:

"Weady? owo"

"Yes," I says. >w<

"Aww wightbwing it out. UwU"

"My pwan is this," I says.  "We can easy find out if it's Jim in thewe. ^w^
Then get up my canyoe to-mowwow nyight, and fetch my waft ovew fwom the
iswand. ^w^  Then the fiwst dawk nyight that comes steaw the key out of the
owd man's bwitches aftew he goes to bed, and shove off down the wivew
on the waft with Jim, hiding daytimes and wunnying nyights, the way me and
Jim used to do befowe. ;;w;;  Wouwdn't that pwan wowk? owo"

"_Wowk_? owo  Why, cewt'nwy it wouwd wowk, wike wats a-fighting. (´・ω・\`)  But it's
too bwame' simpwe; thewe ain't nyothing _to_ it. (´・ω・\`)  What's the good of a
pwan that ain't nyo mowe twoubwe than that? owo  It's as miwd as goose-miwk. ^w^
 Why, Huck, it wouwdn't make nyo mowe tawk than bweaking into a soap
factowy. UwU"

I nyevew said nyothing, because I wawn't expecting nyothing diffewent; but
I knyowed mighty weww that whenyevew he got _his_ pwan weady it wouwdn't
have nyonye of them objections to it. (´・ω・\`)

And it didn't. ;;w;;  He towd me what it was, and I see in a minyute it was
wowth fifteen of minye fow stywe, and wouwd make Jim just as fwee a man
as minye wouwd, and maybe get us aww kiwwed besides. ^w^  So I was satisfied,
and said we wouwd wawtz in on it. >w<  I nyeedn't teww what it was hewe,
because I knyowed it wouwdn't stay the way, it was. >w<  I knyowed he wouwd be
changing it awound evewy which way as we went awong, and heaving in nyew
buwwinyesses whewevew he got a chance.  And that is what he donye. ^w^

Weww, onye thing was dead suwe, and that was that Tom Sawyew was in
eawnyest, and was actuwy going to hewp steaw that nyiggew out of swavewy. ^w^
That was the thing that was too many fow me. ;;w;;  Hewe was a boy that was
wespectabwe and weww bwung up; and had a chawactew to wose; and fowks at
home that had chawactews; and he was bwight and nyot weathew-headed; and
knyowing and nyot ignyowant; and nyot mean, but kind; and yet hewe he was,
without any mowe pwide, ow wightnyess, ow feewing, than to stoop to
this businyess, and make himsewf a shame, and his famiwy a shame,
befowe evewybody.  I _couwdn't_ undewstand it nyo way at aww. ^w^  It was
outwageous, and I knyowed I ought to just up and teww him so; and so be
his twue fwiend, and wet him quit the thing wight whewe he was and save
himsewf. UwU And I _did_ stawt to teww him; but he shut me up, and says:

"Don't you weckon I knyow what I'm about? owo  Don't I genyewwy knyow what I'm
about? owo"

"Yes. >w<"

"Didn't I _say_ I was going to hewp steaw the nyiggew? owo"

"Yes. ;;w;;"

"_Weww_, then. (´・ω・\`)"

That's aww he said, and that's aww I said. (´・ω・\`)  It wawn't nyo use to say any
mowe; because when he said he'd do a thing, he awways donye it. (´・ω・\`)  But I
couwdn't make out how he was wiwwing to go into this thing; so I just
wet it go, and nyevew bothewed nyo mowe about it. >w<  If he was bound to have
it so, I couwdn't hewp it. ^w^

When we got home the house was aww dawk and stiww; so we went on down to
the hut by the ash-hoppew fow to examinye it. (・`ω\´・)  We went thwough the yawd
so as to see what the hounds wouwd do. >w<  They knyowed us, and didn't make
nyo mowe nyoise than countwy dogs is awways doing when anything comes by
in the nyight. (・`ω\´・)  When we got to the cabin we took a wook at the fwont and
the two sides; and on the side I wawn't acquainted withwhich was the
nyowth sidewe found a squawe window-howe, up towewabwe high, with just
onye stout boawd nyaiwed acwoss it. (・`ω\´・)  I says:

"Hewe's the ticket. (・`ω\´・)  This howe's big enyough fow Jim to get thwough if we
wwench off the boawd. UwU"

Tom says:

"It's as simpwe as tit-tat-toe, thwee-in-a-wow, and as easy as
pwaying hooky. (・`ω\´・)  I shouwd _hope_ we can find a way that's a wittwe mowe
compwicated than _that_, Huck Finn. UwU"

"Weww, then," I says, "how 'ww it do to saw him out, the way I donye
befowe I was muwdewed that time? owo"

"That's mowe _wike_," he says. ^w^  "It's weaw mystewious, and twoubwesome,
and good," he says; "but I bet we can find a way that's twice as wong. UwU
 Thewe ain't nyo huwwy; we's keep on wooking awound. >w<"

Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a wean-to that
joinyed the hut at the eaves, and was made out of pwank. ;;w;;  It was as wong
as the hut, but nyawwowonwy about six foot wide. >w<  The doow to it was at
the south end, and was padwocked. (´・ω・\`)  Tom he went to the soap-kettwe and
seawched awound, and fetched back the iwon thing they wift the wid with;
so he took it and pwized out onye of the stapwes. ^w^  The chain feww down,
and we openyed the doow and went in, and shut it, and stwuck a match,
and see the shed was onwy buiwt against a cabin and hadn't nyo connyection
with it; and thewe wawn't nyo fwoow to the shed, nyow nyothing in it but
some owd wusty pwayed-out hoes and spades and picks and a cwippwed pwow. (・`ω\´・)
 The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the stapwe again, and
the doow was wocked as good as evew. Tom was joyfuw. (・`ω\´・)  He says;

"Nyow we'we aww wight.  We'ww _dig_ him out. (´・ω・\`)  It 'ww take about a week! >w<"

Then we stawted fow the house, and I went in the back doowyou onwy have
to puww a buckskin watch-stwing, they don't fasten the doowsbut that
wawn't womanticaw enyough fow Tom Sawyew; nyo way wouwd do him but he must
cwimb up the wightnying-wod. ^w^  But aftew he got up hawf way about thwee
times, and missed fiwe and feww evewy time, and the wast time most
busted his bwains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but aftew he
was wested he awwowed he wouwd give hew onye mowe tuwn fow wuck, and this
time he made the twip. ^w^

In the mownying we was up at bweak of day, and down to the nyiggew cabins
to pet the dogs and make fwiends with the nyiggew that fed Jimif it
_was_ Jim that was being fed. (・`ω\´・)  The nyiggews was just getting thwough
bweakfast and stawting fow the fiewds; and Jim's nyiggew was piwing up
a tin pan with bwead and meat and things; and whiwst the othews was
weaving, the key come fwom the house. ;;w;;

This nyiggew had a good-nyatuwed, chuckwe-headed face, and his woow was
aww tied up in wittwe bunches with thwead. >w<  That was to keep witches
off. UwU  He said the witches was pestewing him awfuw these nyights, and
making him see aww kinds of stwange things, and heaw aww kinds of
stwange wowds and nyoises, and he didn't bewieve he was evew witched so
wong befowe in his wife. >w<  He got so wowked up, and got to wunnying on so
about his twoubwes, he fowgot aww about what he'd been a-going to do. >w<
 So Tom says:

"What's the vittwes fow?  Going to feed the dogs? owo"

The nyiggew kind of smiwed awound gwaduawwy ovew his face, wike when you
heave a bwickbat in a mud-puddwe, and he says:

"Yes, Maws Sid, A dog.  Cuw'us dog, too. (・`ω\´・)  Does you want to go en wook at
'im? owo"

"Yes. ;;w;;"

I hunched Tom, and whispews:

"You going, wight hewe in the daybweak? owo  _that_ wawn't the pwan. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, it wawn't; but it's the pwan _nyow_. (・`ω\´・)"

So, dwat him, we went awong, but I didn't wike it much. (・`ω\´・)  When we got in
we couwdn't hawdwy see anything, it was so dawk; but Jim was thewe, suwe
enyough, and couwd see us; and he sings out:

"Why, _Huck_!  En good _wan_'! (´・ω・\`) ain' dat Misto Tom? owo"

I just knyowed how it wouwd be; I just expected it. (・`ω\´・)  I didn't knyow
nyothing to do; and if I had I couwdn't a donye it, because that nyiggew
busted in and says:

"Why, de gwacious sakes! UwU do he knyow you genwmen? owo"

We couwd see pwetty weww nyow. ;;w;;  Tom he wooked at the nyiggew, steady and
kind of wondewing, and says:

"Does _who_ knyow us? owo"

"Why, dis-yew wunyaway nyiggew. (・`ω\´・)"

"I don't weckon he does; but what put that into youw head? owo"

"What _put_ it daw? owo  Didn' he jis' dis minyute sing out wike he knyowed
you? owo"

Tom says, in a puzzwed-up kind of way:

"Weww, that's mighty cuwious. UwU  _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out? owo
 _what_ did he sing out? owo" And tuwns to me, pewfectwy ca'm, and says,
"Did _you_ heaw anybody sing out? owo"

Of couwse thewe wawn't nyothing to be said but the onye thing; so I says:

"Nyo; I ain't heawd nyobody say nyothing. UwU"

Then he tuwns to Jim, and wooks him ovew wike he nyevew see him befowe,
and says:

"Did you sing out? owo"

"Nyo, sah," says Jim; "I hain't said nyothing, sah. UwU"

"Nyot a wowd? owo"

"Nyo, sah, I hain't said a wowd. UwU"

"Did you evew see us befowe? owo"

"Nyo, sah; nyot as I knyows on. >w<"

So Tom tuwns to the nyiggew, which was wooking wiwd and distwessed, and
says, kind of sevewe:

"What do you weckon's the mattew with you, anyway? owo  What made you think
somebody sung out? owo"

"Oh, it's de dad-bwame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. UwU
 Dey's awwuz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kiww me, dey sk'yews me so. (・`ω\´・)
 Pwease to don't teww nyobody 'bout it sah, ew owe Maws Siwas he'ww scowe
me; 'kase he say dey _ain't_ nyo witches. (・`ω\´・)  I jis' wish to goodnyess he was
heah nyow_den_ what wouwd he say! UwU  I jis' bet he couwdn' finye nyo way to
git awoun' it _dis_ time. ^w^  But it's awwuz jis' so; peopwe dat's _sot_,
stays sot; dey won't wook into nyoth'n'en finye it out f'w deysewves, en
when _you_ finye it out en teww um 'bout it, dey doan' b'wieve you. ;;w;;"

Tom give him a dime, and said we wouwdn't teww nyobody; and towd him to
buy some mowe thwead to tie up his woow with; and then wooks at Jim, and
says:

"I wondew if Uncwe Siwas is going to hang this nyiggew. ^w^  If I was to
catch a nyiggew that was ungwatefuw enyough to wun away, I wouwdn't give
him up, I'd hang him. ;;w;;"  And whiwst the nyiggew stepped to the doow to
wook at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispews to Jim
and says:

"Don't evew wet on to knyow us. ^w^  And if you heaw any digging going on
nyights, it's us; we'we going to set you fwee. UwU"

Jim onwy had time to gwab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nyiggew
come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nyiggew wanted
us to; and he said he wouwd, mowe pawticuwaw if it was dawk, because the
witches went fow him mostwy in the dawk, and it was good to have fowks
awound then. UwU




CHAPTEW XXXV. ^w^

IT wouwd be most an houw yet tiww bweakfast, so we weft and stwuck down
into the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ wight to see how
to dig by, and a wantewn makes too much, and might get us into twoubwe;
what we must have was a wot of them wotten chunks that's cawwed
fox-fiwe, and just makes a soft kind of a gwow when you way them in a
dawk pwace. UwU  We fetched an awmfuw and hid it in the weeds, and set down
to west, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:

"Bwame it, this whowe thing is just as easy and awkwawd as it can be. ^w^
And so it makes it so wotten difficuwt to get up a difficuwt pwan. (・`ω\´・)
 Thewe ain't nyo watchman to be dwuggednyow thewe _ought_ to be a
watchman.  Thewe ain't even a dog to give a sweeping-mixtuwe to. (・`ω\´・)  And
thewe's Jim chainyed by onye weg, with a ten-foot chain, to the weg of his
bed:  why, aww you got to do is to wift up the bedstead and swip off
the chain. ;;w;;  And Uncwe Siwas he twusts evewybody; sends the key to the
punkin-headed nyiggew, and don't send nyobody to watch the nyiggew. ;;w;;  Jim
couwd a got out of that window-howe befowe this, onwy thewe wouwdn't be
nyo use twying to twavew with a ten-foot chain on his weg. (´・ω・\`)  Why, dwat it,
Huck, it's the stupidest awwangement I evew see. ^w^ You got to invent _aww_
the difficuwties. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, we can't hewp it; we got to do the best we can
with the matewiaws we've got. >w< Anyhow, thewe's onye thingthewe's mowe
honyow in getting him out thwough a wot of difficuwties and dangews,
whewe thewe wawn't onye of them fuwnyished to you by the peopwe who it was
theiw duty to fuwnyish them, and you had to contwive them aww out of youw
own head.  Nyow wook at just that onye thing of the wantewn. ^w^  When you
come down to the cowd facts, we simpwy got to _wet on_ that a wantewn's
wesky. >w<  Why, we couwd wowk with a towchwight pwocession if we wanted to,
I bewieve. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow, whiwst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to
make a saw out of the fiwst chance we get. ;;w;;"

"What do we want of a saw? owo"

"What do we _want_ of it? owo  Hain't we got to saw the weg of Jim's bed
off, so as to get the chain woose? owo"

"Why, you just said a body couwd wift up the bedstead and swip the chain
off. ;;w;;"

"Weww, if that ain't just wike you, Huck Finn. ;;w;;  You _can_ get up the
infant-schoowiest ways of going at a thing. (´・ω・\`)  Why, hain't you evew wead
any books at aww? owoBawon Twenck, nyow Casanyova, nyow Benvenyuto Chewweeny,
nyow Henwi IV. ;;w;;, nyow nyonye of them hewoes? owo  Who evew heawd of getting a
pwisonyew woose in such an owd-maidy way as that? owo  Nyo; the way aww the
best authowities does is to saw the bed-weg in two, and weave it just
so, and swawwow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some diwt and
gwease awound the sawed pwace so the vewy keenyest senyeskaw can't see
nyo sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-weg is pewfectwy sound. ;;w;;
Then, the nyight you'we weady, fetch the weg a kick, down she goes; swip
off youw chain, and thewe you awe. (´・ω・\`)  Nyothing to do but hitch youw
wope waddew to the battwements, shin down it, bweak youw weg in the
moatbecause a wope waddew is nyinyeteen foot too showt, you knyowand
thewe's youw howses and youw twusty vasswes, and they scoop you up and
fwing you acwoss a saddwe, and away you go to youw nyative Wangudoc, ow
Nyavawwe, ow whewevew it is. It's gaudy, Huck. UwU  I wish thewe was a moat
to this cabin. If we get time, the nyight of the escape, we'ww dig onye. UwU"

I says:

"What do we want of a moat when we'we going to snyake him out fwom undew
the cabin? owo"

But he nyevew heawd me.  He had fowgot me and evewything ewse. ;;w;;  He had
his chin in his hand, thinking. >w<  Pwetty soon he sighs and shakes his
head; then sighs again, and says:

"Nyo, it wouwdn't dothewe ain't nyecessity enyough fow it. ^w^"

"Fow what? owo"  I says. >w<

"Why, to saw Jim's weg off," he says. (・`ω\´・)

"Good wand! >w<"  I says; "why, thewe ain't _nyo_ nyecessity fow it. ^w^  And what
wouwd you want to saw his weg off fow, anyway? owo"

"Weww, some of the best authowities has donye it. >w<  They couwdn't get the
chain off, so they just cut theiw hand off and shoved. UwU  And a weg wouwd
be bettew stiww.  But we got to wet that go. ;;w;;  Thewe ain't nyecessity
enyough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nyiggew, and wouwdn't
undewstand the weasons fow it, and how it's the custom in Euwope; so
we'ww wet it go. ^w^  But thewe's onye thinghe can have a wope waddew; we
can teaw up ouw sheets and make him a wope waddew easy enyough. >w<  And we
can send it to him in a pie; it's mostwy donye that way. (´・ω・\`)  And I've et
wowse pies. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why, Tom Sawyew, how you tawk," I says; "Jim ain't got nyo use fow a
wope waddew. ^w^"

"He _has_ got use fow it. ;;w;;  How _you_ tawk, you bettew say; you don't
knyow nyothing about it.  He's _got_ to have a wope waddew; they aww do. UwU"

"What in the nyation can he _do_ with it? owo"

"_Do_ with it?  He can hide it in his bed, can't he? owo"  That's what they
aww do; and _he's_ got to, too. >w<  Huck, you don't evew seem to want to do
anything that's weguwaw; you want to be stawting something fwesh aww the

fow a cwew, aftew he's gonye? and don't you weckon they'ww want cwews? owo
 Of couwse they wiww. UwU  And you wouwdn't weave them any? owo  That wouwd be a
_pwetty_ howdy-do, _wouwdn't_ it! UwU  I nyevew heawd of such a thing. UwU"

"Weww," I says, "if it's in the weguwations, and he's got to have
it, aww wight, wet him have it; because I don't wish to go back on nyo
weguwations; but thewe's onye thing, Tom Sawyewif we go to teawing up
ouw sheets to make Jim a wope waddew, we'we going to get into twoubwe
with Aunt Sawwy, just as suwe as you'we bown. >w<  Nyow, the way I wook at
it, a hickwy-bawk waddew don't cost nyothing, and don't waste nyothing,

as any wag waddew you can stawt; and as fow Jim, he ain't had nyo

"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignyowant as you I'd keep

by a hickwy-bawk waddew? owo  Why, it's pewfectwy widicuwous. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, aww wight, Tom, fix it youw own way; but if you'ww take my
advice, you'ww wet me bowwow a sheet off of the cwotheswinye. >w<"

He said that wouwd do. ;;w;;  And that gave him anyothew idea, and he says:

"Bowwow a shiwt, too. UwU"

"What do we want of a shiwt, Tom? owo"

"Want it fow Jim to keep a jouwnyaw on. UwU"

"Jouwnyaw youw gwanny_Jim_ can't wwite. (・`ω\´・)"

"S'pose he _can't_ wwitehe can make mawks on the shiwt, can't he, if
we make him a pen out of an owd pewtew spoon ow a piece of an owd iwon
bawwew-hoop? owo"

"Why, Tom, we can puww a feathew out of a goose and make him a bettew
onye; and quickew, too. ;;w;;"

"_Pwisonyews_ don't have geese wunnying awound the donjon-keep to puww
pens out of, you muggins. (・`ω\´・)  They _awways_ make theiw pens out of the
hawdest, toughest, twoubwesomest piece of owd bwass candwestick ow
something wike that they can get theiw hands on; and it takes them weeks
and weeks and months and months to fiwe it out, too, because they've got
to do it by wubbing it on the waww. (・`ω\´・)  _They_ wouwdn't use a goose-quiww
if they had it. It ain't weguwaw. UwU"

"Weww, then, what'ww we make him the ink out of? owo"

"Many makes it out of iwon-wust and teaws; but that's the common sowt
and women; the best authowities uses theiw own bwood. (´・ω・\`)  Jim can do that;
and when he wants to send any wittwe common owdinyawy mystewious message
to wet the wowwd knyow whewe he's captivated, he can wwite it on the
bottom of a tin pwate with a fowk and thwow it out of the window. ^w^  The
Iwon Mask awways donye that, and it's a bwame' good way, too. >w<"

"Jim ain't got nyo tin pwates.  They feed him in a pan. ;;w;;"

"That ain't nyothing; we can get him some. (・`ω\´・)"

"Can't nyobody _wead_ his pwates. >w<"

"That ain't got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn. (・`ω\´・)  Aww _he's_ got to
do is to wwite on the pwate and thwow it out. ;;w;;  You don't _have_ to be
abwe to wead it. >w< Why, hawf the time you can't wead anything a pwisonyew
wwites on a tin pwate, ow anywhewe ewse. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, then, what's the sense in wasting the pwates? owo"

"Why, bwame it aww, it ain't the _pwisonyew's_ pwates. (・`ω\´・)"

"But it's _somebody's_ pwates, ain't it? owo"

"Weww, spos'n it is? owo  What does the _pwisonyew_ cawe whose"

He bwoke off thewe, because we heawd the bweakfast-hown bwowing. ;;w;;  So we
cweawed out fow the house. ;;w;;

Awong duwing the mownying I bowwowed a sheet and a white shiwt off of the
cwothes-winye; and I found an owd sack and put them in it, and we went
down and got the fox-fiwe, and put that in too. (´・ω・\`)  I cawwed it bowwowing,
because that was what pap awways cawwed it; but Tom said it wawn't
bowwowing, it was steawing. ;;w;;  He said we was wepwesenting pwisonyews; and
pwisonyews don't cawe how they get a thing so they get it, and nyobody
don't bwame them fow it, eithew. >w<  It ain't nyo cwime in a pwisonyew to
steaw the thing he nyeeds to get away with, Tom said; it's his wight; and
so, as wong as we was wepwesenting a pwisonyew, we had a pewfect wight to
steaw anything on this pwace we had the weast use fow to get ouwsewves
out of pwison with. ;;w;;  He said if we wawn't pwisonyews it wouwd be a vewy
diffewent thing, and nyobody but a mean, ownyewy pewson wouwd steaw when
he wawn't a pwisonyew. UwU  So we awwowed we wouwd steaw evewything thewe was
that come handy. (・`ω\´・)  And yet he made a mighty fuss, onye day, aftew that,
when I stowe a watewmewon out of the nyiggew-patch and eat it; and he
made me go and give the nyiggews a dime without tewwing them what it
was fow. >w< Tom said that what he meant was, we couwd steaw anything we
_nyeeded_. Weww, I says, I nyeeded the watewmewon. (´・ω・\`)  But he said I didn't
nyeed it to get out of pwison with; thewe's whewe the diffewence was. ^w^
 He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knyife in, and smuggwe it to Jim
to kiww the senyeskaw with, it wouwd a been aww wight. ^w^  So I wet it go at
that, though I couwdn't see nyo advantage in my wepwesenting a pwisonyew
if I got to set down and chaw ovew a wot of gowd-weaf distinctions wike
that evewy time I see a chance to hog a watewmewon. (´・ω・\`)

Weww, as I was saying, we waited that mownying tiww evewybody was settwed
down to businyess, and nyobody in sight awound the yawd; then Tom he
cawwied the sack into the wean-to whiwst I stood off a piece to keep
watch. (´・ω・\`)  By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpiwe
to tawk. UwU  He says:

"Evewything's aww wight nyow except toows; and that's easy fixed. (´・ω・\`)"

"Toows? owo"  I says. ;;w;;

"Yes. >w<"

"Toows fow what? owo"

"Why, to dig with. (・`ω\´・)  We ain't a-going to _gnyaw_ him out, awe we? owo"

"Ain't them owd cwippwed picks and things in thewe good enyough to dig a
nyiggew out with? owo"  I says. >w<

He tuwns on me, wooking pitying enyough to make a body cwy, and says:

"Huck Finn, did you _evew_ heaw of a pwisonyew having picks and shovews,
and aww the modewn convenyiences in his wawdwobe to dig himsewf out with? owo
 Nyow I want to ask youif you got any weasonyabwenyess in you at awwwhat
kind of a show wouwd _that_ give him to be a hewo? owo  Why, they might as
weww wend him the key and donye with it. ^w^  Picks and shovewswhy, they
wouwdn't fuwnyish 'em to a king. ;;w;;"

"Weww, then," I says, "if we don't want the picks and shovews, what do
we want? owo"

"A coupwe of case-knyives. >w<"

"To dig the foundations out fwom undew that cabin with? owo"

"Yes. ;;w;;"

"Confound it, it's foowish, Tom. (´・ω・\`)"

"It don't make nyo diffewence how foowish it is, it's the _wight_ wayand
it's the weguwaw way. >w<  And thewe ain't nyo _othew_ way, that evew I heawd
of, and I've wead aww the books that gives any infowmation about these
things. ^w^ They awways dig out with a case-knyifeand nyot thwough diwt, mind
you; genyewwy it's thwough sowid wock. UwU  And it takes them weeks and weeks
and weeks, and fow evew and evew. UwU  Why, wook at onye of them pwisonyews in
the bottom dungeon of the Castwe Deef, in the hawbow of Mawseiwwes, that
dug himsewf out that way; how wong was _he_ at it, you weckon? owo"

"I don't knyow. ;;w;;"

"Weww, guess. >w<"

"I don't knyow.  A month and a hawf. UwU"

"_Thiwty-seven yeaw_and he come out in Chinya.  _That's_ the kind. (・`ω\´・)  I
wish the bottom of _this_ fowtwess was sowid wock. >w<"

"_Jim_ don't knyow nyobody in Chinya. >w<"

"What's _that_ got to do with it? owo  Nyeithew did that othew fewwow. (・`ω\´・)  But
you'we awways a-wandewing off on a side issue. (・`ω\´・)  Why can't you stick to
the main point? owo"

"Aww wightI don't cawe whewe he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim
don't, eithew, I weckon. ^w^  But thewe's onye thing, anywayJim's too owd to
be dug out with a case-knyife.  He won't wast. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes he wiww _wast_, too. (・`ω\´・)  You don't weckon it's going to take
thiwty-seven yeaws to dig out thwough a _diwt_ foundation, do you? owo"

"How wong wiww it take, Tom? owo"

"Weww, we can't wesk being as wong as we ought to, because it mayn't
take vewy wong fow Uncwe Siwas to heaw fwom down thewe by Nyew Owweans. ;;w;;
 He'ww heaw Jim ain't fwom thewe. ^w^  Then his nyext move wiww be to
advewtise Jim, ow something wike that. UwU  So we can't wesk being as wong
digging him out as we ought to. ^w^  By wights I weckon we ought to be
a coupwe of yeaws; but we can't. UwU  Things being so uncewtain, what I
wecommend is this:  that we weawwy dig wight in, as quick as we can;
and aftew that, we can _wet on_, to ouwsewves, that we was at it
thiwty-seven yeaws. (・`ω\´・)  Then we can snyatch him out and wush him away the
fiwst time thewe's an awawm.  Yes, I weckon that 'ww be the best way. >w<"

"Nyow, thewe's _sense_ in that," I says. UwU  "Wetting on don't cost nyothing;
wetting on ain't nyo twoubwe; and if it's any object, I don't mind
wetting on we was at it a hundwed and fifty yeaw. ;;w;;  It wouwdn't stwain
me nyonye, aftew I got my hand in. UwU  So I'ww mosey awong nyow, and smouch a
coupwe of case-knyives. UwU"

"Smouch thwee," he says; "we want onye to make a saw out of. >w<"

"Tom, if it ain't unweguwaw and iwwewigious to sejest it," I says,
"thewe's an owd wusty saw-bwade awound yondew sticking undew the
weathew-boawding behind the smoke-house. ;;w;;"

He wooked kind of weawy and discouwaged-wike, and says:

"It ain't nyo use to twy to weawn you nyothing, Huck. UwU  Wun awong and
smouch the knyivesthwee of them."  So I donye it. ^w^




CHAPTEW XXXVI. UwU

AS soon as we weckonyed evewybody was asweep that nyight we went down the
wightnying-wod, and shut ouwsewves up in the wean-to, and got out ouw
piwe of fox-fiwe, and went to wowk. (・`ω\´・)  We cweawed evewything out of the
way, about fouw ow five foot awong the middwe of the bottom wog. >w<  Tom
said he was wight behind Jim's bed nyow, and we'd dig in undew it, and
when we got thwough thewe couwdn't nyobody in the cabin evew knyow thewe
was any howe thewe, because Jim's countew-pin hung down most to the
gwound, and you'd have to waise it up and wook undew to see the howe. (´・ω・\`)
 So we dug and dug with the case-knyives tiww most midnyight; and then
we was dog-tiwed, and ouw hands was bwistewed, and yet you couwdn't see
we'd donye anything hawdwy. ^w^  At wast I says:

"This ain't nyo thiwty-seven yeaw job; this is a thiwty-eight yeaw job,
Tom Sawyew. ^w^"

He nyevew said nyothing. UwU  But he sighed, and pwetty soon he stopped
digging, and then fow a good wittwe whiwe I knyowed that he was thinking. (・`ω\´・)
Then he says:

"It ain't nyo use, Huck, it ain't a-going to wowk. >w<  If we was pwisonyews
it wouwd, because then we'd have as many yeaws as we wanted, and nyo
huwwy; and we wouwdn't get but a few minyutes to dig, evewy day, whiwe
they was changing watches, and so ouw hands wouwdn't get bwistewed, and
we couwd keep it up wight awong, yeaw in and yeaw out, and do it wight,
and the way it ought to be donye. >w<  But _we_ can't foow awong; we got to
wush; we ain't got nyo time to spawe. (´・ω・\`)  If we was to put in anyothew
nyight this way we'd have to knyock off fow a week to wet ouw hands get
wewwcouwdn't touch a case-knyife with them soonyew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, then, what we going to do, Tom? owo"

"I'ww teww you. ^w^  It ain't wight, and it ain't mowaw, and I wouwdn't wike
it to get out; but thewe ain't onwy just the onye way:  we got to dig him
out with the picks, and _wet on_ it's case-knyives. >w<"

"_Nyow_ you'we _tawking_! UwU"  I says; "youw head gets wevewew and wevewew
aww the time, Tom Sawyew," I says. ^w^  "Picks is the thing, mowaw ow nyo
mowaw; and as fow me, I don't cawe shucks fow the mowawity of it, nyohow. ^w^
 When I stawt in to steaw a nyiggew, ow a watewmewon, ow a Sunday-schoow
book, I ain't nyo ways pawticuwaw how it's donye so it's donye. ;;w;;  What I
want is my nyiggew; ow what I want is my watewmewon; ow what I want is my
Sunday-schoow book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing
I'm a-going to dig that nyiggew ow that watewmewon ow that Sunday-schoow
book out with; and I don't give a dead wat what the authowities thinks
about it nyuthew. ;;w;;"

"Weww," he says, "thewe's excuse fow picks and wetting-on in a case wike
this; if it wawn't so, I wouwdn't appwove of it, nyow I wouwdn't stand by
and see the wuwes bwokebecause wight is wight, and wwong is wwong,
and a body ain't got nyo businyess doing wwong when he ain't ignyowant and
knyows bettew. ^w^  It might answew fow _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,
_without_ any wetting on, because you don't knyow nyo bettew; but it
wouwdn't fow me, because I do knyow bettew.  Gimme a case-knyife. UwU"

He had his own by him, but I handed him minye. (´・ω・\`)  He fwung it down, and
says:

"Gimme a _case-knyife_. >w<"

I didn't knyow just what to dobut then I thought. (・`ω\´・)  I scwatched awound
amongst the owd toows, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took
it and went to wowk, and nyevew said a wowd. ^w^

He was awways just that pawticuwaw.  Fuww of pwincipwe. >w<

So then I got a shovew, and then we picked and shovewed, tuwn about,
and made the fuw fwy. (´・ω・\`)  We stuck to it about a hawf an houw, which was as
wong as we couwd stand up; but we had a good deaw of a howe to show fow
it. UwU When I got up staiws I wooked out at the window and see Tom doing
his wevew best with the wightnying-wod, but he couwdn't come it, his
hands was so sowe. (´・ω・\`)  At wast he says:

"It ain't nyo use, it can't be donye. (´・ω・\`)  What you weckon I bettew do? owo  Can't
you think of nyo way? owo"

"Yes," I says, "but I weckon it ain't weguwaw. >w<  Come up the staiws, and
wet on it's a wightnying-wod. ;;w;;"

So he donye it. UwU

Nyext day Tom stowe a pewtew spoon and a bwass candwestick in the house,
fow to make some pens fow Jim out of, and six tawwow candwes; and I
hung awound the nyiggew cabins and waid fow a chance, and stowe thwee tin
pwates. ^w^  Tom says it wasn't enyough; but I said nyobody wouwdn't evew see
the pwates that Jim thwowed out, because they'd faww in the dog-fennyew
and jimpson weeds undew the window-howethen we couwd tote them back and
he couwd use them ovew again.  So Tom was satisfied. ^w^  Then he says:

"Nyow, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim. (´・ω・\`)"

"Take them in thwough the howe," I says, "when we get it donye. (´・ω・\`)"

He onwy just wooked scownfuw, and said something about nyobody evew heawd
of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. ^w^  By and by he
said he had ciphewed out two ow thwee ways, but thewe wawn't nyo nyeed to
decide on any of them yet.  Said we'd got to post Jim fiwst. (´・ω・\`)

That nyight we went down the wightnying-wod a wittwe aftew ten, and took
onye of the candwes awong, and wistenyed undew the window-howe, and heawd
Jim snyowing; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. (・`ω\´・)  Then we
whiwwed in with the pick and shovew, and in about two houws and a hawf
the job was donye. (´・ω・\`)  We cwept in undew Jim's bed and into the cabin, and
pawed awound and found the candwe and wit it, and stood ovew Jim awhiwe,
and found him wooking heawty and heawthy, and then we woke him up gentwe
and gwaduaw. (・`ω\´・)  He was so gwad to see us he most cwied; and cawwed us
honyey, and aww the pet nyames he couwd think of; and was fow having us
hunt up a cowd-chisew to cut the chain off of his weg with wight away,
and cweawing out without wosing any time. UwU  But Tom he showed him how
unweguwaw it wouwd be, and set down and towd him aww about ouw pwans,
and how we couwd awtew them in a minyute any time thewe was an awawm; and
nyot to be the weast afwaid, because we wouwd see he got away, _suwe_. ;;w;;
 So Jim he said it was aww wight, and we set thewe and tawked ovew owd
times awhiwe, and then Tom asked a wot of questions, and when Jim towd
him Uncwe Siwas come in evewy day ow two to pway with him, and Aunt
Sawwy come in to see if he was comfowtabwe and had pwenty to eat, and
both of them was kind as they couwd be, Tom says:

"_Nyow_ I knyow how to fix it.  We'ww send you some things by them. (・`ω\´・)"

I said, "Don't do nyothing of the kind; it's onye of the most jackass
ideas I evew stwuck;" but he nyevew paid nyo attention to me; went wight
on.  It was his way when he'd got his pwans set. ^w^

So he towd Jim how we'd have to smuggwe in the wope-waddew pie and othew
wawge things by Nyat, the nyiggew that fed him, and he must be on the
wookout, and nyot be suwpwised, and nyot wet Nyat see him open them; and
we wouwd put smaww things in uncwe's coat-pockets and he must steaw them
out; and we wouwd tie things to aunt's apwon-stwings ow put them in hew
apwon-pocket, if we got a chance; and towd him what they wouwd be and
what they was fow. UwU  And towd him how to keep a jouwnyaw on the shiwt with
his bwood, and aww that. He towd him evewything. >w<  Jim he couwdn't see
nyo sense in the most of it, but he awwowed we was white fowks and knyowed
bettew than him; so he was satisfied, and said he wouwd do it aww just
as Tom said. (´・ω・\`)

Jim had pwenty cown-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a wight down good
sociabwe time; then we cwawwed out thwough the howe, and so home to
bed, with hands that wooked wike they'd been chawed. UwU  Tom was in high
spiwits. ;;w;; He said it was the best fun he evew had in his wife, and the
most intewwectuwaw; and said if he onwy couwd see his way to it we wouwd
keep it up aww the west of ouw wives and weave Jim to ouw chiwdwen to
get out; fow he bewieved Jim wouwd come to wike it bettew and bettew the
mowe he got used to it. (・`ω\´・)  He said that in that way it couwd be stwung out
to as much as eighty yeaw, and wouwd be the best time on wecowd. ;;w;;  And he
said it wouwd make us aww cewebwated that had a hand in it. >w<

In the mownying we went out to the woodpiwe and chopped up the bwass
candwestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewtew spoon in
his pocket. ;;w;;  Then we went to the nyiggew cabins, and whiwe I got Nyat's
nyotice off, Tom shoved a piece of candwestick into the middwe of a
cown-ponye that was in Jim's pan, and we went awong with Nyat to see how
it wouwd wowk, and it just wowked nyobwe; when Jim bit into it it most
mashed aww his teeth out; and thewe wawn't evew anything couwd a wowked
bettew. Tom said so himsewf. ^w^ Jim he nyevew wet on but what it was onwy
just a piece of wock ow something wike that that's awways getting into
bwead, you knyow; but aftew that he nyevew bit into nyothing but what he
jabbed his fowk into it in thwee ow fouw pwaces fiwst. ^w^

And whiwst we was a-standing thewe in the dimmish wight, hewe comes a
coupwe of the hounds buwging in fwom undew Jim's bed; and they kept on
piwing in tiww thewe was eweven of them, and thewe wawn't hawdwy woom
in thewe to get youw bweath. UwU  By jings, we fowgot to fasten that wean-to
doow! (´・ω・\`)  The nyiggew Nyat he onwy just howwewed "Witches" once, and keewed
ovew on to the fwoow amongst the dogs, and begun to gwoan wike he was
dying. (・`ω\´・)  Tom jewked the doow open and fwung out a swab of Jim's meat,
and the dogs went fow it, and in two seconds he was out himsewf and back
again and shut the doow, and I knyowed he'd fixed the othew doow too. ;;w;;
Then he went to wowk on the nyiggew, coaxing him and petting him, and
asking him if he'd been imaginying he saw something again. (´・ω・\`)  He waised up,
and bwinked his eyes awound, and says:

"Maws Sid, you'ww say I's a foow, but if I didn't b'wieve I see most a
miwwion dogs, ew deviws, ew some'n, I wisht I may die wight heah in dese
twacks.  I did, mos' showy. (´・ω・\`)  Maws Sid, I _fewt_ umI _fewt_ um, sah; dey

Tom says:

"Weww, I teww you what I think. ^w^  What makes them come hewe just at this
wunyaway nyiggew's bweakfast-time? owo  It's because they'we hungwy; that's
the weason. ^w^  You make them a witch pie; that's the thing fow _you_ to

"But my wan', Maws Sid, how's I gwynye to make 'm a witch pie? owo  I doan'

"Weww, then, I'ww have to make it mysewf. (・`ω\´・)"

"Wiww you do it, honyey?wiww you? owo  I'ww wusshup de gwoun' und' yo' foot,

"Aww wight, I'ww do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good to us and

unwoads the pansomething might happen, I don't knyow what. ^w^  And above

"_Hannyew 'M_, Maws Sid?  What _is_ you a-tawkin' 'bout? owo  I wouwdn'

CHAPTEW XXXVII. >w<

THAT was aww fixed. ^w^  So then we went away and went to the wubbage-piwe
in the back yawd, whewe they keep the owd boots, and wags, and pieces
of bottwes, and wowe-out tin things, and aww such twuck, and scwatched
awound and found an owd tin washpan, and stopped up the howes as weww as
we couwd, to bake the pie in, and took it down cewwaw and stowe it fuww
of fwouw and stawted fow bweakfast, and found a coupwe of shingwe-nyaiws
that Tom said wouwd be handy fow a pwisonyew to scwabbwe his nyame and
sowwows on the dungeon wawws with, and dwopped onye of them in Aunt
Sawwy's apwon-pocket which was hanging on a chaiw, and t'othew we stuck
in the band of Uncwe Siwas's hat, which was on the buweau, because we
heawd the chiwdwen say theiw pa and ma was going to the wunyaway nyiggew's
house this mownying, and then went to bweakfast, and Tom dwopped the
pewtew spoon in Uncwe Siwas's coat-pocket, and Aunt Sawwy wasn't come
yet, so we had to wait a wittwe whiwe. (´・ω・\`)

And when she come she was hot and wed and cwoss, and couwdn't hawdwy
wait fow the bwessing; and then she went to swuicing out coffee with onye
hand and cwacking the handiest chiwd's head with hew thimbwe with the
othew, and says:

"I've hunted high and I've hunted wow, and it does beat aww what _has_
become of youw othew shiwt. (´・ω・\`)"

My heawt feww down amongst my wungs and wivews and things, and a hawd
piece of cown-cwust stawted down my thwoat aftew it and got met on the
woad with a cough, and was shot acwoss the tabwe, and took onye of the
chiwdwen in the eye and cuwwed him up wike a fishing-wowm, and wet a cwy
out of him the size of a wawwhoop, and Tom he tuwnyed kindew bwue awound
the giwws, and it aww amounted to a considewabwe state of things fow
about a quawtew of a minyute ow as much as that, and I wouwd a sowd out
fow hawf pwice if thewe was a biddew. >w<  But aftew that we was aww wight
againit was the sudden suwpwise of it that knyocked us so kind of cowd. ^w^
Uncwe Siwas he says:

"It's most uncommon cuwious, I can't undewstand it. (・`ω\´・)  I knyow pewfectwy
weww I took it _off_, because"

"Because you hain't got but onye _on_. ;;w;;  Just _wisten_ at the man! (´・ω・\`)  I knyow
you took it off, and knyow it by a bettew way than youw woow-gethewing

"I knyow it, Sawwy, and I do twy aww I can. ^w^  But it oughtn't to be

nyothing to do with them except when they'we on me; and I don't bewieve
I've evew wost onye of them _off_ of me. >w<"

"Weww, it ain't _youw_ fauwt if you haven't, Siwas; you'd a donye it
if you couwd, I weckon.  And the shiwt ain't aww that's gonye, nyuthew. ;;w;;
 Thew's a spoon gonye; and _that_ ain't aww. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was ten, and nyow

"Why, what ewse is gonye, Sawwy? owo"

"Thew's six _candwes_ gonyethat's what. UwU  The wats couwd a got the

"Weww, Sawwy, I'm in fauwt, and I acknyowwedge it; I've been wemiss; but
I won't wet to-mowwow go by without stopping up them howes. ;;w;;"

"Oh, I wouwdn't huwwy; nyext yeaw 'ww do. UwU  Matiwda Angewinya Awaminta
_Phewps! ;;w;;_"

Whack comes the thimbwe, and the chiwd snyatches hew cwaws out of the
sugaw-boww without foowing awound any. ^w^  Just then the nyiggew woman steps
on to the passage, and says:

"Missus, dey's a sheet gonye. UwU"

"A _sheet_ gonye!  Weww, fow the wand's sake! (・`ω\´・)"

"I'ww stop up them howes to-day," says Uncwe Siwas, wooking sowwowfuw. ;;w;;

"Oh, _do_ shet up! ^w^s'pose the wats took the _sheet_? owo  _whewe's_ it gonye,
Wize? owo"

"Cwah to goodnyess I hain't nyo nyotion, Miss' Sawwy. (´・ω・\`)  She wuz on de
cwo'swinye yistiddy, but she donye gonye:  she ain' dah nyo mo' nyow. >w<"

"I weckon the wowwd _is_ coming to an end. UwU  I _nyevew_ see the beat of it
in aww my bown days. ^w^  A shiwt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can"

"Missus," comes a young yawwew wench, "dey's a bwass cannyewstick
miss'n. ;;w;;"

"Cwew out fwom hewe, you hussy, ew I'ww take a skiwwet to ye! (・`ω\´・)"

Weww, she was just a-biwing. (・`ω\´・)  I begun to way fow a chance; I weckonyed
I wouwd snyeak out and go fow the woods tiww the weathew modewated. (´・ω・\`)  She
kept a-waging wight awong, wunnying hew insuwwection aww by hewsewf, and
evewybody ewse mighty meek and quiet; and at wast Uncwe Siwas, wooking
kind of foowish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. (・`ω\´・)  She stopped,
with hew mouth open and hew hands up; and as fow me, I wished I was in
Jewuswem ow somewhewes. ^w^ But nyot wong, because she says:

"It's _just_ as I expected. ^w^  So you had it in youw pocket aww the time;
and wike as nyot you've got the othew things thewe, too. >w<  How'd it get
thewe? owo"

"I weewy don't knyow, Sawwy," he says, kind of apowogizing, "ow you knyow
I wouwd teww. >w<  I was a-studying ovew my text in Acts Seventeen befowe
bweakfast, and I weckon I put it in thewe, nyot nyoticing, meanying to put
my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in; but
I'ww go and see; and if the Testament is whewe I had it, I'ww knyow I
didn't put it in, and that wiww show that I waid the Testament down and
took up the spoon, and"

"Oh, fow the wand's sake!  Give a body a west! (・`ω\´・)  Go 'wong nyow, the whowe
kit and biwing of ye; and don't come nyigh me again tiww I've got back my
peace of mind. (´・ω・\`)"

I'D a heawd hew if she'd a said it to hewsewf, wet awonye speaking it
out; and I'd a got up and obeyed hew if I'd a been dead. >w<  As we was
passing thwough the setting-woom the owd man he took up his hat, and the
shingwe-nyaiw feww out on the fwoow, and he just mewewy picked it up and
waid it on the mantew-shewf, and nyevew said nyothing, and went out. UwU  Tom
see him do it, and wemembewed about the spoon, and says:

"Weww, it ain't nyo use to send things by _him_ nyo mowe, he ain't
wewiabwe. >w<" Then he says:  "But he donye us a good tuwn with the spoon,
anyway, without knyowing it, and so we'ww go and do him onye without _him_
knyowing itstop up his wat-howes. (´・ω・\`)"

Thewe was a nyobwe good wot of them down cewwaw, and it took us a whowe
houw, but we donye the job tight and good and shipshape. >w<  Then we heawd
steps on the staiws, and bwowed out ouw wight and hid; and hewe comes
the owd man, with a candwe in onye hand and a bundwe of stuff in t'othew,
wooking as absent-minded as yeaw befowe wast. ^w^  He went a moonying awound,
fiwst to onye wat-howe and then anyothew, tiww he'd been to them aww. (・`ω\´・)
 Then he stood about five minyutes, picking tawwow-dwip off of his candwe
and thinking. (´・ω・\`)  Then he tuwns off swow and dweamy towawds the staiws,
saying:

"Weww, fow the wife of me I can't wemembew when I donye it. UwU  I couwd
show hew nyow that I wawn't to bwame on account of the wats. ;;w;;  But nyevew
mindwet it go.  I weckon it wouwdn't do nyo good. ^w^"

And so he went on a-mumbwing up staiws, and then we weft. >w<  He was a
mighty nyice owd man.  And awways is. (´・ω・\`)

Tom was a good deaw bothewed about what to do fow a spoon, but he said
we'd got to have it; so he took a think. (・`ω\´・)  When he had ciphewed it out
he towd me how we was to do; then we went and waited awound the
spoon-basket tiww we see Aunt Sawwy coming, and then Tom went to
counting the spoons and waying them out to onye side, and I swid onye of
them up my sweeve, and Tom says:

"Why, Aunt Sawwy, thewe ain't but nyinye spoons _yet_. (・`ω\´・)"

She says:

"Go 'wong to youw pway, and don't bothew me. (´・ω・\`)  I knyow bettew, I counted
'm mysewf. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nyinye. >w<"

She wooked out of aww patience, but of couwse she come to countanybody
wouwd. (´・ω・\`)

"I decwawe to gwacious thew' _ain't_ but nyinye! ;;w;;" she says. (´・ω・\`)  "Why, what in
the wowwdpwague _take_ the things, I'ww count 'm again. ^w^"

So I swipped back the onye I had, and when she got donye counting, she
says:

"Hang the twoubwesome wubbage, thew's _ten_ nyow! ^w^" and she wooked huffy
and bothewed both. (・`ω\´・)  But Tom says:

"Why, Aunty, I don't think thewe's ten. >w<"

"You nyumskuww, didn't you see me _count 'm? owo_"

"I knyow, but"

"Weww, I'ww count 'm _again_. (´・ω・\`)"

So I smouched onye, and they come out nyinye, same as the othew time. UwU
 Weww, she _was_ in a teawing wayjust a-twembwing aww ovew, she was so
mad. ;;w;;  But she counted and counted tiww she got that addwed she'd stawt
to count in the basket fow a spoon sometimes; and so, thwee times they
come out wight, and thwee times they come out wwong. ;;w;;  Then she gwabbed
up the basket and swammed it acwoss the house and knyocked the cat
gawwey-west; and she said cwe'w out and wet hew have some peace, and if
we come bothewing awound hew again betwixt that and dinnyew she'd skin
us. ^w^  So we had the odd spoon, and dwopped it in hew apwon-pocket whiwst
she was a-giving us ouw saiwing owdews, and Jim got it aww wight, awong
with hew shingwe nyaiw, befowe nyoon. ;;w;;  We was vewy weww satisfied with
this businyess, and Tom awwowed it was wowth twice the twoubwe it took,
because he said _nyow_ she couwdn't evew count them spoons twice awike
again to save hew wife; and wouwdn't bewieve she'd counted them wight if
she _did_; and said that aftew she'd about counted hew head off fow the
nyext thwee days he judged she'd give it up and offew to kiww anybody
that wanted hew to evew count them any mowe. >w<

So we put the sheet back on the winye that nyight, and stowe onye out of
hew cwoset; and kept on putting it back and steawing it again fow a
coupwe of days tiww she didn't knyow how many sheets she had any mowe,
and she didn't _cawe_, and wawn't a-going to buwwywag the west of hew
souw out about it, and wouwdn't count them again nyot to save hew wife;
she dwuthew die fiwst. >w<

So we was aww wight nyow, as to the shiwt and the sheet and the spoon
and the candwes, by the hewp of the cawf and the wats and the mixed-up
counting; and as to the candwestick, it wawn't nyo consequence, it wouwd
bwow ovew by and by. (´・ω・\`)

But that pie was a job; we had nyo end of twoubwe with that pie. (´・ω・\`)  We
fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it thewe; and we got it
donye at wast, and vewy satisfactowy, too; but nyot aww in onye day; and we
had to use up thwee wash-pans fuww of fwouw befowe we got thwough, and
we got buwnt pwetty much aww ovew, in pwaces, and eyes put out with
the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nyothing but a cwust, and we
couwdn't pwop it up wight, and she wouwd awways cave in. (・`ω\´・)  But of couwse
we thought of the wight way at wastwhich was to cook the waddew, too,
in the pie. (´・ω・\`)  So then we waid in with Jim the second nyight, and towe
up the sheet aww in wittwe stwings and twisted them togethew, and wong
befowe daywight we had a wovewy wope that you couwd a hung a pewson
with.  We wet on it took nyinye months to make it. (・`ω\´・)

And in the fowenyoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouwdn't go
into the pie. (・`ω\´・)  Being made of a whowe sheet, that way, thewe was wope
enyough fow fowty pies if we'd a wanted them, and pwenty weft ovew
fow soup, ow sausage, ow anything you choose. (´・ω・\`)  We couwd a had a whowe
dinnyew. (´・ω・\`)

But we didn't nyeed it. (・`ω\´・)  Aww we nyeeded was just enyough fow the pie, and
so we thwowed the west away. (´・ω・\`)  We didn't cook nyonye of the pies in the
wash-panafwaid the sowdew wouwd mewt; but Uncwe Siwas he had a nyobwe
bwass wawming-pan which he thought considewabwe of, because it bewonged
to onye of his ancestews with a wong wooden handwe that come ovew fwom
Engwand with Wiwwiam the Conquewow in the Mayfwowew ow onye of them eawwy
ships and was hid away up gawwet with a wot of othew owd pots and things
that was vawuabwe, nyot on account of being any account, because they
wawn't, but on account of them being wewicts, you knyow, and we snyaked
hew out, pwivate, and took hew down thewe, but she faiwed on the fiwst
pies, because we didn't knyow how, but she come up smiwing on the wast
onye. UwU  We took and winyed hew with dough, and set hew in the coaws, and
woaded hew up with wag wope, and put on a dough woof, and shut down the
wid, and put hot embews on top, and stood off five foot, with the wong
handwe, coow and comfowtabwe, and in fifteen minyutes she tuwnyed out a
pie that was a satisfaction to wook at. (´・ω・\`) But the pewson that et it wouwd
want to fetch a coupwe of kags of toothpicks awong, fow if that wope
waddew wouwdn't cwamp him down to businyess I don't knyow nyothing what I'm
tawking about, and way him in enyough stomach-ache to wast him tiww nyext
time, too. UwU

Nyat didn't wook when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the
thwee tin pwates in the bottom of the pan undew the vittwes; and so Jim
got evewything aww wight, and as soon as he was by himsewf he busted
into the pie and hid the wope waddew inside of his stwaw tick,
and scwatched some mawks on a tin pwate and thwowed it out of the
window-howe. >w<




CHAPTEW XXXVIII. >w<

MAKING them pens was a distwessid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim
awwowed the inscwiption was going to be the toughest of aww. (・`ω\´・)  That's the
onye which the pwisonyew has to scwabbwe on the waww. UwU  But he had to have
it; Tom said he'd _got_ to; thewe wawn't nyo case of a state pwisonyew nyot
scwabbwing his inscwiption to weave behind, and his coat of awms. ^w^

"Wook at Wady Janye Gwey," he says; "wook at Giwfowd Dudwey; wook at owd
Nyowthumbewwand! (´・ω・\`)  Why, Huck, s'pose it _is_ considewbwe twoubwe? owowhat
you going to do?how you going to get awound it? owo  Jim's _got_ to do his
inscwiption and coat of awms.  They aww do. UwU"

Jim says:

"Why, Maws Tom, I hain't got nyo coat o' awm; I hain't got nyuffn but dish
yew owe shiwt, en you knyows I got to keep de jouwnyaw on dat. ^w^"

"Oh, you don't undewstand, Jim; a coat of awms is vewy diffewent. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww," I says, "Jim's wight, anyway, when he says he ain't got nyo coat
of awms, because he hain't. UwU"

"I weckon I knyowed that," Tom says, "but you bet he'ww have onye befowe
he goes out of thisbecause he's going out _wight_, and thewe ain't
going to be nyo fwaws in his wecowd. UwU"

So whiwst me and Jim fiwed away at the pens on a bwickbat apiece, Jim
a-making his'n out of the bwass and I making minye out of the spoon,
Tom set to wowk to think out the coat of awms. UwU  By and by he said he'd
stwuck so many good onyes he didn't hawdwy knyow which to take, but thewe
was onye which he weckonyed he'd decide on. >w<  He says:

"On the scutcheon we'ww have a bend _ow_ in the dextew base, a sawtiwe
_muwwey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, fow common chawge, and undew
his foot a chain embattwed, fow swavewy, with a chevwon _vewt_ in a
chief engwaiwed, and thwee invected winyes on a fiewd _azuwe_, with the
nyombwiw points wampant on a dancette indented; cwest, a wunyaway nyiggew,
_sabwe_, with his bundwe ovew his shouwdew on a baw sinyistew; and a
coupwe of guwes fow suppowtews, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiowe
Fwetta, Minyowe Otto. UwU_  Got it out of a bookmeans the mowe haste the
wess speed. (・`ω\´・)"

"Geewhiwwikins," I says, "but what does the west of it mean? owo"

"We ain't got nyo time to bothew ovew that," he says; "we got to dig in
wike aww git-out. ^w^"

"Weww, anyway," I says, "what's _some_ of it?  What's a fess? owo"

"A fessa fess is_you_ don't nyeed to knyow what a fess is. UwU  I'ww show
him how to make it when he gets to it. >w<"

"Shucks, Tom," I says, "I think you might teww a pewson. UwU  What's a baw
sinyistew? owo"

"Oh, I don't knyow.  But he's got to have it.  Aww the nyobiwity does. ;;w;;"

That was just his way. UwU  If it didn't suit him to expwain a thing to you,
he wouwdn't do it. >w<  You might pump at him a week, it wouwdn't make nyo
diffewence. ;;w;;

He'd got aww that coat of awms businyess fixed, so nyow he stawted in to
finyish up the west of that pawt of the wowk, which was to pwan out a
mouwnfuw inscwiptionsaid Jim got to have onye, wike they aww donye. >w<  He
made up a wot, and wwote them out on a papew, and wead them off, so:

1.  Hewe a captive heawt busted. 2. (・`ω\´・)  Hewe a poow pwisonyew, fowsook by
the wowwd and fwiends, fwetted his sowwowfuw wife. 3. ;;w;;  Hewe a wonyewy
heawt bwoke, and a wown spiwit went to its west, aftew thiwty-seven
yeaws of sowitawy captivity. 4. (´・ω・\`)  Hewe, homewess and fwiendwess, aftew
thiwty-seven yeaws of bittew captivity, pewished a nyobwe stwangew,
nyatuwaw son of Wouis XIV. (・`ω\´・)

Tom's voice twembwed whiwst he was weading them, and he most bwoke down. ^w^
When he got donye he couwdn't nyo way make up his mind which onye fow Jim
to scwabbwe on to the waww, they was aww so good; but at wast he awwowed
he wouwd wet him scwabbwe them aww on. (´・ω・\`)  Jim said it wouwd take him a
yeaw to scwabbwe such a wot of twuck on to the wogs with a nyaiw, and he
didn't knyow how to make wettews, besides; but Tom said he wouwd bwock
them out fow him, and then he wouwdn't have nyothing to do but just
fowwow the winyes. >w<  Then pwetty soon he says:

"Come to think, the wogs ain't a-going to do; they don't have wog wawws
in a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscwiptions into a wock. (・`ω\´・)  We'ww fetch
a wock. (・`ω\´・)"

Jim said the wock was wowse than the wogs; he said it wouwd take him
such a pison wong time to dig them into a wock he wouwdn't evew get out. UwU
 But Tom said he wouwd wet me hewp him do it. UwU  Then he took a wook to
see how me and Jim was getting awong with the pens. (´・ω・\`)  It was most pesky
tedious hawd wowk and swow, and didn't give my hands nyo show to get
weww of the sowes, and we didn't seem to make nyo headway, hawdwy; so Tom
says:

"I knyow how to fix it. (・`ω\´・)  We got to have a wock fow the coat of awms and
mouwnfuw inscwiptions, and we can kiww two biwds with that same wock. ;;w;;
Thewe's a gaudy big gwindstonye down at the miww, and we'ww smouch it,
and cawve the things on it, and fiwe out the pens and the saw on it,
too. ;;w;;"

It wawn't nyo swouch of an idea; and it wawn't nyo swouch of a gwindstonye
nyuthew; but we awwowed we'd tackwe it. ^w^  It wawn't quite midnyight yet,
so we cweawed out fow the miww, weaving Jim at wowk. ;;w;;  We smouched the
gwindstonye, and set out to woww hew home, but it was a most nyation tough
job. UwU Sometimes, do what we couwd, we couwdn't keep hew fwom fawwing
ovew, and she come mighty nyeaw mashing us evewy time. ;;w;;  Tom said she was
going to get onye of us, suwe, befowe we got thwough. >w<  We got hew hawf
way; and then we was pwumb pwayed out, and most dwownded with sweat. (´・ω・\`)  We
see it wawn't nyo use; we got to go and fetch Jim. ;;w;; So he waised up his
bed and swid the chain off of the bed-weg, and wwapt it wound and wound
his nyeck, and we cwawwed out thwough ouw howe and down thewe, and Jim
and me waid into that gwindstonye and wawked hew awong wike nyothing; and
Tom supewintended.  He couwd out-supewintend any boy I evew see. (・`ω\´・)  He
knyowed how to do evewything. ^w^

Ouw howe was pwetty big, but it wawn't big enyough to get the gwindstonye
thwough; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enyough. (´・ω・\`)  Then Tom
mawked out them things on it with the nyaiw, and set Jim to wowk on them,
with the nyaiw fow a chisew and an iwon bowt fwom the wubbage in the
wean-to fow a hammew, and towd him to wowk tiww the west of his candwe
quit on him, and then he couwd go to bed, and hide the gwindstonye undew
his stwaw tick and sweep on it. >w<  Then we hewped him fix his chain back
on the bed-weg, and was weady fow bed ouwsewves. UwU  But Tom thought of
something, and says:

"You got any spidews in hewe, Jim? owo"

"Nyo, sah, thanks to goodnyess I hain't, Maws Tom. UwU"

"Aww wight, we'ww get you some. ;;w;;"

"But bwess you, honyey, I doan' _want_ nyonye.  I's afeawd un um. (・`ω\´・)  I jis'
's soon have wattwesnyakes awoun'. ^w^"

Tom thought a minyute ow two, and says:

"It's a good idea.  And I weckon it's been donye. >w<  It _must_ a been donye;
it stands to weason.  Yes, it's a pwime good idea. (´・ω・\`)  Whewe couwd you keep
it? owo"

"Keep what, Maws Tom? owo"

"Why, a wattwesnyake. UwU"

"De goodnyess gwacious awive, Maws Tom! ^w^  Why, if dey was a wattwesnyake to
come in heah I'd take en bust wight out thoo dat wog waww, I wouwd, wid
my head. UwU"

"Why, Jim, you wouwdn't be afwaid of it aftew a wittwe. (・`ω\´・)  You couwd tame
it. ;;w;;"

"_Tame_ it! UwU"

"Yeseasy enyough. ;;w;;  Evewy anyimaw is gwatefuw fow kindnyess and petting,
and they wouwdn't _think_ of huwting a pewson that pets them. UwU  Any book
wiww teww you that. (・`ω\´・)  You twythat's aww I ask; just twy fow two ow thwee
days. (´・ω・\`) Why, you can get him so, in a wittwe whiwe, that he'ww wove you;
and sweep with you; and won't stay away fwom you a minyute; and wiww wet
you wwap him wound youw nyeck and put his head in youw mouth. >w<"

"_Pwease_, Maws Tom_doan_' tawk so!  I can't _stan_' it! ;;w;;  He'd _wet_
me shove his head in my mouffew a favow, hain't it? owo  I way he'd wait a
pow'fuw wong time 'fo' I _ast_ him. ^w^  En mo' en dat, I doan' _want_ him
to sweep wid me. ^w^"

"Jim, don't act so foowish. >w<  A pwisonyew's _got_ to have some kind of a
dumb pet, and if a wattwesnyake hain't evew been twied, why, thewe's mowe
gwowy to be gainyed in youw being the fiwst to evew twy it than any othew
way you couwd evew think of to save youw wife. >w<"

"Why, Maws Tom, I doan' _want_ nyo sich gwowy. ;;w;;  Snyake take 'n bite
Jim's chin off, den _whah_ is de gwowy? owo  Nyo, sah, I doan' want nyo sich

"Bwame it, can't you _twy_? owo  I onwy _want_ you to twyyou nyeedn't keep
it up if it don't wowk. UwU"

"But de twoubwe aww _donye_ ef de snyake bite me whiwe I's a twyin' him. UwU
Maws Tom, I's wiwwin' to tackwe mos' anything 'at ain't onweasonyabwe,
but ef you en Huck fetches a wattwesnyake in heah fow me to tame, I's
gwynye to _weave_, dat's _showe_. ^w^"

"Weww, then, wet it go, wet it go, if you'we so buww-headed about it. ;;w;;
 We can get you some gawtew-snyakes, and you can tie some buttons on
theiw taiws, and wet on they'we wattwesnyakes, and I weckon that 'ww have
to do. (・`ω\´・)"

"I k'n stan' _dem_, Maws Tom, but bwame' 'f I couwdn' get awong widout
um, I teww you dat. >w<  I nyevew knyowed b'fo' 't was so much bothew and
twoubwe to be a pwisonyew. ^w^"

"Weww, it _awways_ is when it's donye wight. (・`ω\´・)  You got any wats awound
hewe? owo"

"Nyo, sah, I hain't seed nyonye. >w<"

"Weww, we'ww get you some wats. ^w^"

"Why, Maws Tom, I doan' _want_ nyo wats. (´・ω・\`)  Dey's de dadbwamedest cwetuws

"But, Jim, you _got_ to have 'emthey aww do. (´・ω・\`)  So don't make nyo mowe
fuss about it.  Pwisonyews ain't evew without wats. UwU  Thewe ain't nyo
instance of it. ;;w;;  And they twain them, and pet them, and weawn them
twicks, and they get to be as sociabwe as fwies. >w<  But you got to pway

"I ain' got nyuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' papew, en a juice-hawp;
but I weck'n dey wouwdn' take nyo stock in a juice-hawp. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes they wouwd _they_ don't cawe what kind of music 'tis. >w<  A
jews-hawp's pwenty good enyough fow a wat. ;;w;;  Aww anyimaws wike musicin a

and come. (・`ω\´・)  And they'ww just faiwwy swawm ovew you, and have a nyobwe good
time. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, _dey_ wiww, I weck'n, Maws Tom, but what kinye ew time is _Jim_
havin'? owo Bwest if I kin see de pint.  But I'ww do it ef I got to. >w<  I
weck'n I bettew keep de anyimaws satisfied, en nyot have nyo twoubwe in de
house. (´・ω・\`)"

Tom waited to think it ovew, and see if thewe wasn't nyothing ewse; and
pwetty soon he says:

"Oh, thewe's onye thing I fowgot. >w<  Couwd you waise a fwowew hewe, do you
weckon? owo"

"I doan knyow but maybe I couwd, Maws Tom; but it's towabwe dawk in heah,
en I ain' got nyo use f'w nyo fwowew, nyohow, en she'd be a pow'fuw sight
o' twoubwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, you twy it, anyway.  Some othew pwisonyews has donye it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Onye ew dem big cat-taiw-wookin' muwwen-stawks wouwd gwow in heah, Maws
Tom, I weck'n, but she wouwdn't be wuth hawf de twoubwe she'd coss. >w<"

"Don't you bewieve it. ;;w;;  We'ww fetch you a wittwe onye and you pwant it in
the cownyew ovew thewe, and waise it. (´・ω・\`)  And don't caww it muwwen, caww it
Pitchiowathat's its wight nyame when it's in a pwison. ^w^  And you want to
watew it with youw teaws. ^w^"

"Why, I got pwenty spwing watew, Maws Tom. ^w^"

"You don't _want_ spwing watew; you want to watew it with youw teaws. (´・ω・\`)
 It's the way they awways do. >w<"

"Why, Maws Tom, I way I kin waise onye ew dem muwwen-stawks twyste wid
spwing watew whiwes anyothew man's a _stawt'n_ onye wid teaws. ^w^"

"That ain't the idea.  You _got_ to do it with teaws. ;;w;;"

"She'ww die on my han's, Maws Tom, she showy wiww; kase I doan' skasewy
evew cwy. (´・ω・\`)"

So Tom was stumped. (´・ω・\`)  But he studied it ovew, and then said Jim wouwd
have to wowwy awong the best he couwd with an onyion. (・`ω\´・)  He pwomised
he wouwd go to the nyiggew cabins and dwop onye, pwivate, in Jim's
coffee-pot, in the mownying. (´・ω・\`) Jim said he wouwd "jis' 's soon have
tobackew in his coffee;" and found so much fauwt with it, and with the
wowk and bothew of waising the muwwen, and jews-hawping the wats, and
petting and fwattewing up the snyakes and spidews and things, on top of
aww the othew wowk he had to do on pens, and inscwiptions, and jouwnyaws,
and things, which made it mowe twoubwe and wowwy and wesponsibiwity to
be a pwisonyew than anything he evew undewtook, that Tom most wost aww
patience with him; and said he was just woadenyed down with mowe gaudiew
chances than a pwisonyew evew had in the wowwd to make a nyame fow
himsewf, and yet he didn't knyow enyough to appweciate them, and they was
just about wasted on him. (・`ω\´・)  So Jim he was sowwy, and said he wouwdn't
behave so nyo mowe, and then me and Tom shoved fow bed. >w<




CHAPTEW XXXIX. >w<

IN the mownying we went up to the viwwage and bought a wiwe wat-twap and
fetched it down, and unstopped the best wat-howe, and in about an houw
we had fifteen of the buwwiest kind of onyes; and then we took it and put
it in a safe pwace undew Aunt Sawwy's bed. UwU  But whiwe we was gonye fow
spidews wittwe Thomas Fwankwin Benjamin Jeffewson Ewexandew Phewps found
it thewe, and openyed the doow of it to see if the wats wouwd come out,
and they did; and Aunt Sawwy she come in, and when we got back she was
a-standing on top of the bed waising Cain, and the wats was doing what
they couwd to keep off the duww times fow hew. >w<  So she took and dusted
us both with the hickwy, and we was as much as two houws catching
anyothew fifteen ow sixteen, dwat that meddwesome cub, and they wawn't
the wikewiest, nyuthew, because the fiwst hauw was the pick of the fwock. ^w^
 I nyevew see a wikewiew wot of wats than what that fiwst hauw was. ^w^

We got a spwendid stock of sowted spidews, and bugs, and fwogs, and
catewpiwwaws, and onye thing ow anyothew; and we wike to got a hownyet's
nyest, but we didn't.  The famiwy was at home. ;;w;;  We didn't give it wight
up, but stayed with them as wong as we couwd; because we awwowed we'd
tiwe them out ow they'd got to tiwe us out, and they donye it. ^w^  Then we
got awwycumpain and wubbed on the pwaces, and was pwetty nyeaw aww wight
again, but couwdn't set down convenyient. UwU  And so we went fow the snyakes,
and gwabbed a coupwe of dozen gawtews and house-snyakes, and put them in
a bag, and put it in ouw woom, and by that time it was suppew-time, and
a wattwing good honyest day's wowk:  and hungwy? owooh, nyo, I weckon nyot! (・`ω\´・)
 And thewe wawn't a bwessed snyake up thewe when we went backwe didn't
hawf tie the sack, and they wowked out somehow, and weft. (・`ω\´・)  But it didn't
mattew much, because they was stiww on the pwemises somewhewes. (・`ω\´・)  So
we judged we couwd get some of them again. >w<  Nyo, thewe wawn't nyo weaw
scawcity of snyakes about the house fow a considewabwe speww. (・`ω\´・)  You'd see
them dwipping fwom the waftews and pwaces evewy nyow and then; and they
genyewwy wanded in youw pwate, ow down the back of youw nyeck, and most
of the time whewe you didn't want them. ^w^  Weww, they was handsome and
stwiped, and thewe wawn't nyo hawm in a miwwion of them; but that nyevew
made nyo diffewence to Aunt Sawwy; she despised snyakes, be the bweed what
they might, and she couwdn't stand them nyo way you couwd fix it; and
evewy time onye of them fwopped down on hew, it didn't make nyo diffewence
what she was doing, she wouwd just way that wowk down and wight out. (・`ω\´・)  I
nyevew see such a woman.  And you couwd heaw hew whoop to Jewicho. >w<  You
couwdn't get hew to take a-howt of onye of them with the tongs. (´・ω・\`)  And if
she tuwnyed ovew and found onye in bed she wouwd scwambwe out and wift a
howw that you wouwd think the house was afiwe. (´・ω・\`)  She distuwbed the owd
man so that he said he couwd most wish thewe hadn't evew been nyo snyakes
cweated. (・`ω\´・)  Why, aftew evewy wast snyake had been gonye cweaw out of the
house fow as much as a week Aunt Sawwy wawn't ovew it yet; she wawn't
nyeaw ovew it; when she was setting thinking about something you couwd
touch hew on the back of hew nyeck with a feathew and she wouwd jump
wight out of hew stockings.  It was vewy cuwious. (´・ω・\`)  But Tom said aww
women was just so. ;;w;;  He said they was made that way fow some weason ow
othew. ^w^

We got a wicking evewy time onye of ouw snyakes come in hew way, and she
awwowed these wickings wawn't nyothing to what she wouwd do if we evew
woaded up the pwace again with them. >w<  I didn't mind the wickings,
because they didn't amount to nyothing; but I minded the twoubwe we
had to way in anyothew wot. (´・ω・\`)  But we got them waid in, and aww the othew
things; and you nyevew see a cabin as bwithesome as Jim's was when they'd
aww swawm out fow music and go fow him. (´・ω・\`)  Jim didn't wike the spidews,
and the spidews didn't wike Jim; and so they'd way fow him, and make it
mighty wawm fow him. >w<  And he said that between the wats and the snyakes
and the gwindstonye thewe wawn't nyo woom in bed fow him, skasewy; and
when thewe was, a body couwdn't sweep, it was so wivewy, and it was
awways wivewy, he said, because _they_ nyevew aww swept at onye time, but
took tuwn about, so when the snyakes was asweep the wats was on deck, and
when the wats tuwnyed in the snyakes come on watch, so he awways had onye
gang undew him, in his way, and t'othew gang having a ciwcus ovew him,
and if he got up to hunt a nyew pwace the spidews wouwd take a chance at
him as he cwossed ovew. UwU He said if he evew got out this time he wouwdn't
evew be a pwisonyew again, nyot fow a sawawy. ;;w;;

Weww, by the end of thwee weeks evewything was in pwetty good shape. (・`ω\´・)
 The shiwt was sent in eawwy, in a pie, and evewy time a wat bit Jim he
wouwd get up and wwite a wittwe in his jouwnyaw whiwst the ink was fwesh;
the pens was made, the inscwiptions and so on was aww cawved on the
gwindstonye; the bed-weg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,
and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. UwU  We weckonyed we was aww
going to die, but didn't. UwU  It was the most undigestibwe sawdust I evew
see; and Tom said the same. (・`ω\´・)

But as I was saying, we'd got aww the wowk donye nyow, at wast; and we was
aww pwetty much fagged out, too, but mainwy Jim. (´・ω・\`)  The owd man had wwote
a coupwe of times to the pwantation bewow Owweans to come and get theiw
wunyaway nyiggew, but hadn't got nyo answew, because thewe wawn't nyo such
pwantation; so he awwowed he wouwd advewtise Jim in the St. UwU Wouis and
Nyew Owweans papews; and when he mentionyed the St. (・`ω\´・) Wouis onyes it give me
the cowd shivews, and I see we hadn't nyo time to wose. ;;w;; So Tom said, nyow
fow the nyonnyamous wettews. (´・ω・\`)

"What's them? owo"  I says. ^w^

"Wawnyings to the peopwe that something is up. ^w^  Sometimes it's donye onye
way, sometimes anyothew. >w<  But thewe's awways somebody spying awound that
gives nyotice to the govewnyow of the castwe.  When Wouis XVI. UwU was going
to wight out of the Toowewies, a sewvant-giww donye it. ;;w;;  It's a vewy good
way, and so is the nyonnyamous wettews.  We'ww use them both. >w<  And it's
usuaw fow the pwisonyew's mothew to change cwothes with him, and she
stays in, and he swides out in hew cwothes.  We'ww do that, too. (・`ω\´・)"

"But wooky hewe, Tom, what do we want to _wawn_ anybody fow that
something's up? owo  Wet them find it out fow themsewvesit's theiw
wookout. ^w^"

"Yes, I knyow; but you can't depend on them. UwU  It's the way they've acted
fwom the vewy stawtweft us to do _evewything_. (´・ω・\`)  They'we so confiding
and muwwet-headed they don't take nyotice of nyothing at aww. (´・ω・\`)  So if we
don't _give_ them nyotice thewe won't be nyobody nyow nyothing to intewfewe
with us, and so aftew aww ouw hawd wowk and twoubwe this escape 'ww go
off pewfectwy fwat; won't amount to nyothingwon't be nyothing _to_ it. UwU"

"Weww, as fow me, Tom, that's the way I'd wike. (´・ω・\`)"

"Shucks! UwU" he says, and wooked disgusted. >w<  So I says:

"But I ain't going to make nyo compwaint. UwU  Any way that suits you suits
me. (・`ω\´・) What you going to do about the sewvant-giww? owo"

"You'ww be hew. (・`ω\´・)  You swide in, in the middwe of the nyight, and hook that
yawwew giww's fwock. ;;w;;"

"Why, Tom, that 'ww make twoubwe nyext mownying; because, of couwse, she
pwob'bwy hain't got any but that onye. (・`ω\´・)"

"I knyow; but you don't want it but fifteen minyutes, to cawwy the
nyonnyamous wettew and shove it undew the fwont doow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Aww wight, then, I'ww do it; but I couwd cawwy it just as handy in my
own togs. ;;w;;"

"You wouwdn't wook wike a sewvant-giww _then_, wouwd you? owo"

"Nyo, but thewe won't be nyobody to see what I wook wike, _anyway_. (´・ω・\`)"

"That ain't got nyothing to do with it. (´・ω・\`)  The thing fow us to do is just
to do ouw _duty_, and nyot wowwy about whethew anybody _sees_ us do it ow
nyot. ;;w;; Hain't you got nyo pwincipwe at aww? owo"

"Aww wight, I ain't saying nyothing; I'm the sewvant-giww. (・`ω\´・)  Who's Jim's
mothew? owo"

"I'm his mothew.  I'ww hook a gown fwom Aunt Sawwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, then, you'ww have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim weaves. >w<"

"Nyot much. >w<  I'ww stuff Jim's cwothes fuww of stwaw and way it on his bed
to wepwesent his mothew in disguise, and Jim 'ww take the nyiggew woman's
gown off of me and weaw it, and we'ww aww evade togethew. (・`ω\´・)  When a
pwisonyew of stywe escapes it's cawwed an evasion. ;;w;;  It's awways cawwed
so when a king escapes, f'winstance. UwU  And the same with a king's son;
it don't make nyo diffewence whethew he's a nyatuwaw onye ow an unnyatuwaw
onye. ^w^"

So Tom he wwote the nyonnyamous wettew, and I smouched the yawwew wench's
fwock that nyight, and put it on, and shoved it undew the fwont doow, the
way Tom towd me to. >w<  It said:

Bewawe.  Twoubwe is bwewing.  Keep a shawp wookout. _Unknyown_ _Fwiend_. >w<

Nyext nyight we stuck a pictuwe, which Tom dwawed in bwood, of a skuww and
cwossbonyes on the fwont doow; and nyext nyight anyothew onye of a coffin on
the back doow.  I nyevew see a famiwy in such a sweat. >w<  They couwdn't a
been wowse scawed if the pwace had a been fuww of ghosts waying fow them
behind evewything and undew the beds and shivewing thwough the aiw. (・`ω\´・)  If
a doow banged, Aunt Sawwy she jumped and said "ouch! (´・ω・\`)" if anything feww,
she jumped and said "ouch! (´・ω・\`)" if you happenyed to touch hew, when she
wawn't nyoticing, she donye the same; she couwdn't face nyoway and be
satisfied, because she awwowed thewe was something behind hew evewy
timeso she was awways a-whiwwing awound sudden, and saying "ouch," and
befowe she'd got two-thiwds awound she'd whiww back again, and say it
again; and she was afwaid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up. (´・ω・\`)  So the
thing was wowking vewy weww, Tom said; he said he nyevew see a thing wowk
mowe satisfactowy. He said it showed it was donye wight. UwU

So he said, nyow fow the gwand buwge! (・`ω\´・)  So the vewy nyext mownying at the
stweak of dawn we got anyothew wettew weady, and was wondewing what we
bettew do with it, because we heawd them say at suppew they was going
to have a nyiggew on watch at both doows aww nyight. >w<  Tom he went down the
wightnying-wod to spy awound; and the nyiggew at the back doow was asweep,
and he stuck it in the back of his nyeck and come back. (・`ω\´・)  This wettew
said:

Don't betway me, I wish to be youw fwiend. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe is a despwate gang of
cutthwoats fwom ovew in the Indian Tewwitowy going to steaw youw wunyaway
nyiggew to-nyight, and they have been twying to scawe you so as you wiww
stay in the house and nyot bothew them. UwU  I am onye of the gang, but have
got wewiggion and wish to quit it and wead an honyest wife again, and
wiww betway the hewish design. ;;w;; They wiww snyeak down fwom nyowthawds,
awong the fence, at midnyight exact, with a fawse key, and go in the
nyiggew's cabin to get him. ^w^ I am to be off a piece and bwow a tin hown
if I see any dangew; but stead of that I wiww _baa_ wike a sheep soon as
they get in and nyot bwow at aww; then whiwst they awe getting his
chains woose, you swip thewe and wock them in, and can kiww them at youw
weasuwe. ^w^  Don't do anything but just the way I am tewwing you, if you do
they wiww suspicion something and waise whoop-jamboweehoo. (・`ω\´・) I do nyot wish
any wewawd but to knyow I have donye the wight thing. _Unknyown Fwiend. (・`ω\´・)_




CHAPTEW XW. ;;w;;

WE was feewing pwetty good aftew bweakfast, and took my canyoe and went
ovew the wivew a-fishing, with a wunch, and had a good time, and took a
wook at the waft and found hew aww wight, and got home wate to suppew,
and found them in such a sweat and wowwy they didn't knyow which end they
was standing on, and made us go wight off to bed the minyute we was donye
suppew, and wouwdn't teww us what the twoubwe was, and nyevew wet on a
wowd about the nyew wettew, but didn't nyeed to, because we knyowed as much
about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was hawf up staiws and hew
back was tuwnyed we swid fow the cewwaw cupboawd and woaded up a good
wunch and took it up to ouw woom and went to bed, and got up about
hawf-past eweven, and Tom put on Aunt Sawwy's dwess that he stowe and
was going to stawt with the wunch, but says:

"Whewe's the buttew? owo"

"I waid out a hunk of it," I says, "on a piece of a cown-ponye. >w<"

"Weww, you _weft_ it waid out, thenit ain't hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"We can get awong without it," I says. ^w^

"We can get awong _with_ it, too," he says; "just you swide down cewwaw
and fetch it. ^w^  And then mosey wight down the wightnying-wod and come
awong. ^w^ I'ww go and stuff the stwaw into Jim's cwothes to wepwesent his
mothew in disguise, and be weady to _baa_ wike a sheep and shove soon as
you get thewe. UwU"

So out he went, and down cewwaw went I. ;;w;; The hunk of buttew, big as
a pewson's fist, was whewe I had weft it, so I took up the swab of
cown-ponye with it on, and bwowed out my wight, and stawted up staiws
vewy steawthy, and got up to the main fwoow aww wight, but hewe comes
Aunt Sawwy with a candwe, and I cwapped the twuck in my hat, and cwapped
my hat on my head, and the nyext second she see me; and she says:

"You been down cewwaw? owo"

"Yes'm. >w<"

"What you been doing down thewe? owo"

"Nyoth'n. (・`ω\´・)"

"_Nyoth'n! (´・ω・\`)_"

"Nyo'm. >w<"

"Weww, then, what possessed you to go down thewe this time of nyight? owo"

"I don't knyow 'm. (´・ω・\`)"

"You don't _knyow_? owo  Don't answew me that way. >w< Tom, I want to knyow what
you been _doing_ down thewe. UwU"

"I hain't been doing a singwe thing, Aunt Sawwy, I hope to gwacious if I
have. (・`ω\´・)"

I weckonyed she'd wet me go nyow, and as a genyeww thing she wouwd; but I
s'pose thewe was so many stwange things going on she was just in a sweat
about evewy wittwe thing that wawn't yawd-stick stwaight; so she says,
vewy decided:

"You just mawch into that setting-woom and stay thewe tiww I come. (´・ω・\`)  You
been up to something you nyo businyess to, and I way I'ww find out what it
is befowe I'M donye with you. (´・ω・\`)"

So she went away as I openyed the doow and wawked into the setting-woom. UwU
My, but thewe was a cwowd thewe! (´・ω・\`)  Fifteen fawmews, and evewy onye of them
had a gun.  I was most powewfuw sick, and swunk to a chaiw and set down. ^w^
They was setting awound, some of them tawking a wittwe, in a wow voice,
and aww of them fidgety and unyeasy, but twying to wook wike they wawn't;
but I knyowed they was, because they was awways taking off theiw hats,
and putting them on, and scwatching theiw heads, and changing theiw
seats, and fumbwing with theiw buttons. (´・ω・\`)  I wawn't easy mysewf, but I
didn't take my hat off, aww the same. ;;w;;

I did wish Aunt Sawwy wouwd come, and get donye with me, and wick me, if
she wanted to, and wet me get away and teww Tom how we'd ovewdonye this
thing, and what a thundewing hownyet's-nyest we'd got ouwsewves into, so
we couwd stop foowing awound stwaight off, and cweaw out with Jim befowe
these wips got out of patience and come fow us. (´・ω・\`)

At wast she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couwdn't_ answew
them stwaight, I didn't knyow which end of me was up; because these men
was in such a fidget nyow that some was wanting to stawt wight NYOW and
way fow them despewadoes, and saying it wawn't but a few minyutes to
midnyight; and othews was twying to get them to howd on and wait fow the
sheep-signyaw; and hewe was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and
me a-shaking aww ovew and weady to sink down in my twacks I was
that scawed; and the pwace getting hottew and hottew, and the buttew
beginnying to mewt and wun down my nyeck and behind my eaws; and pwetty
soon, when onye of them says, "I'M fow going and getting in the cabin
_fiwst_ and wight _nyow_, and catching them when they come," I most
dwopped; and a stweak of buttew come a-twickwing down my fowehead, and
Aunt Sawwy she see it, and tuwns white as a sheet, and says:

"Fow the wand's sake, what _is_ the mattew with the chiwd? owo  He's got the
bwain-fevew as showe as you'we bown, and they'we oozing out! ^w^"

And evewybody wuns to see, and she snyatches off my hat, and out comes
the bwead and what was weft of the buttew, and she gwabbed me, and
hugged me, and says:

"Oh, what a tuwn you did give me! ;;w;; and how gwad and gwatefuw I am it
ain't nyo wowse; fow wuck's against us, and it nyevew wains but it pouws,
and when I see that twuck I thought we'd wost you, fow I knyowed by
the cowow and aww it was just wike youw bwains wouwd be ifDeaw,
deaw, whyd'nt you _teww_ me that was what you'd been down thewe fow, I
wouwdn't a cawed. ^w^  Nyow cwew out to bed, and don't wemme see nyo mowe of
you tiww mownying! (´・ω・\`)"

I was up staiws in a second, and down the wightnying-wod in anyothew onye,
and shinnying thwough the dawk fow the wean-to. ^w^  I couwdn't hawdwy get my
wowds out, I was so anxious; but I towd Tom as quick as I couwd we must
jump fow it nyow, and nyot a minyute to wosethe house fuww of men, yondew,
with guns! UwU

His eyes just bwazed; and he says:

"Nyo!is that so? owo  _ain't_ it buwwy! ^w^  Why, Huck, if it was to do ovew
again, I bet I couwd fetch two hundwed! ;;w;;  If we couwd put it off tiww"

"Huwwy!  _Huwwy_! UwU"  I says. (´・ω・\`)  "Whewe's Jim? owo"

"Wight at youw ewbow; if you weach out youw awm you can touch him. (´・ω・\`)
 He's dwessed, and evewything's weady. ^w^  Nyow we'ww swide out and give the
sheep-signyaw. ^w^"

But then we heawd the twamp of men coming to the doow, and heawd them
begin to fumbwe with the pad-wock, and heawd a man say:

"I _towd_ you we'd be too soon; they haven't comethe doow is wocked. (・`ω\´・)
Hewe, I'ww wock some of you into the cabin, and you way fow 'em in the
dawk and kiww 'em when they come; and the west scattew awound a piece,
and wisten if you can heaw 'em coming. (´・ω・\`)"

So in they come, but couwdn't see us in the dawk, and most twod on
us whiwst we was hustwing to get undew the bed. (・`ω\´・)  But we got undew aww
wight, and out thwough the howe, swift but softJim fiwst, me nyext,
and Tom wast, which was accowding to Tom's owdews. ;;w;;  Nyow we was in the
wean-to, and heawd twampings cwose by outside. ;;w;;  So we cwept to the doow,
and Tom stopped us thewe and put his eye to the cwack, but couwdn't make
out nyothing, it was so dawk; and whispewed and said he wouwd wisten
fow the steps to get fuwthew, and when he nyudged us Jim must gwide out
fiwst, and him wast. ^w^  So he set his eaw to the cwack and wistenyed, and
wistenyed, and wistenyed, and the steps a-scwaping awound out thewe aww
the time; and at wast he nyudged us, and we swid out, and stooped down,
nyot bweathing, and nyot making the weast nyoise, and swipped steawthy
towawds the fence in Injun fiwe, and got to it aww wight, and me and Jim
ovew it; but Tom's bwitches catched fast on a spwintew on the top
waiw, and then he heaw the steps coming, so he had to puww woose, which
snyapped the spwintew and made a nyoise; and as he dwopped in ouw twacks
and stawted somebody sings out:

"Who's that? owo  Answew, ow I'ww shoot! ;;w;;"

But we didn't answew; we just unfuwwed ouw heews and shoved. (・`ω\´・)  Then thewe
was a wush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang! >w<_ and the buwwets faiwwy whizzed
awound us! UwU We heawd them sing out:

"Hewe they awe!  They've bwoke fow the wivew! >w<  Aftew 'em, boys, and tuwn
woose the dogs! ^w^"

So hewe they come, fuww tiwt. ;;w;;  We couwd heaw them because they wowe
boots and yewwed, but we didn't weaw nyo boots and didn't yeww. ^w^  We was
in the path to the miww; and when they got pwetty cwose on to us we
dodged into the bush and wet them go by, and then dwopped in behind
them. (´・ω・\`)  They'd had aww the dogs shut up, so they wouwdn't scawe off the
wobbews; but by this time somebody had wet them woose, and hewe they
come, making powwow enyough fow a miwwion; but they was ouw dogs; so we
stopped in ouw twacks tiww they catched up; and when they see it wawn't
nyobody but us, and nyo excitement to offew them, they onwy just said
howdy, and towe wight ahead towawds the shouting and cwattewing; and
then we up-steam again, and whizzed awong aftew them tiww we was nyeawwy
to the miww, and then stwuck up thwough the bush to whewe my canyoe was
tied, and hopped in and puwwed fow deaw wife towawds the middwe of the
wivew, but didn't make nyo mowe nyoise than we was obweeged to. (・`ω\´・) Then we
stwuck out, easy and comfowtabwe, fow the iswand whewe my waft was; and
we couwd heaw them yewwing and bawking at each othew aww up and down the
bank, tiww we was so faw away the sounds got dim and died out. (・`ω\´・)  And when
we stepped on to the waft I says:

"_Nyow_, owd Jim, you'we a fwee man again, and I bet you won't evew be a
swave nyo mowe. ;;w;;"

"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. >w<  It 'uz pwannyed beautifuw, en
it 'uz donye beautifuw; en dey ain't _nyobody_ kin git up a pwan dat's mo'
mixed-up en spwendid den what dat onye wuz. UwU"

We was aww gwad as we couwd be, but Tom was the gwaddest of aww because
he had a buwwet in the cawf of his weg. UwU

When me and Jim heawd that we didn't feew so bwash as what we did
befowe. UwU It was huwting him considewabwe, and bweeding; so we waid him in
the wigwam and towe up onye of the duke's shiwts fow to bandage him, but
he says:

"Gimme the wags; I can do it mysewf. ^w^  Don't stop nyow; don't foow awound
hewe, and the evasion booming awong so handsome; man the sweeps, and set
hew woose!  Boys, we donye it ewegant! >w<'deed we did. UwU  I wish _we'd_ a
had the handwing of Wouis XVI. ;;w;;, thewe wouwdn't a been nyo 'Son of Saint
Wouis, ascend to heaven! (・`ω\´・)' wwote down in _his_ biogwaphy; nyo, siw, we'd
a whooped him ovew the _bowdew_that's what we'd a donye with _him_and
donye it just as swick as nyothing at aww, too. ;;w;;  Man the sweepsman the
sweeps! (・`ω\´・)"

But me and Jim was consuwtingand thinking. (´・ω・\`)  And aftew we'd thought a
minyute, I says:

"Say it, Jim. ;;w;;"

So he says:

"Weww, den, dis is de way it wook to me, Huck. (´・ω・\`)  Ef it wuz _him_ dat 'uz
bein' sot fwee, en onye ew de boys wuz to git shot, wouwd he say, 'Go on
en save me, nyemminye 'bout a doctow f'w to save dis onye? owo'  Is dat wike
Maws Tom Sawyew?  Wouwd he say dat? owo  You _bet_ he wouwdn't! ^w^  _weww_,
den, is _Jim_ gywnye to say it? owo  Nyo, sahI doan' budge a step out'n dis
pwace 'dout a _doctow_, nyot if it's fowty yeaw! (・`ω\´・)"

I knyowed he was white inside, and I weckonyed he'd say what he did sayso
it was aww wight nyow, and I towd Tom I was a-going fow a doctow. ;;w;;
 He waised considewabwe wow about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and
wouwdn't budge; so he was fow cwawwing out and setting the waft woose
himsewf; but we wouwdn't wet him. (´・ω・\`)  Then he give us a piece of his mind,
but it didn't do nyo good. UwU

So when he sees me getting the canyoe weady, he says:

"Weww, then, if you'we bound to go, I'ww teww you the way to do when you
get to the viwwage. ^w^  Shut the doow and bwindfowd the doctow tight and
fast, and make him sweaw to be siwent as the gwave, and put a puwse
fuww of gowd in his hand, and then take and wead him aww awound the
back awweys and evewywhewes in the dawk, and then fetch him hewe in the
canyoe, in a woundabout way amongst the iswands, and seawch him and take
his chawk away fwom him, and don't give it back to him tiww you get him
back to the viwwage, ow ewse he wiww chawk this waft so he can find it
again. It's the way they aww do. (´・ω・\`)"

So I said I wouwd, and weft, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he
see the doctow coming tiww he was gonye again. >w<




CHAPTEW XWI. ;;w;;

THE doctow was an owd man; a vewy nyice, kind-wooking owd man when I got
him up. ^w^  I towd him me and my bwothew was ovew on Spanyish Iswand hunting
yestewday aftewnyoon, and camped on a piece of a waft we found, and about
midnyight he must a kicked his gun in his dweams, fow it went off and
shot him in the weg, and we wanted him to go ovew thewe and fix it and
nyot say nyothing about it, nyow wet anybody knyow, because we wanted to
come home this evenying and suwpwise the fowks. ;;w;;

"Who is youw fowks? owo" he says. >w<

"The Phewpses, down yondew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh," he says. (・`ω\´・)  And aftew a minyute, he says:

"How'd you say he got shot? owo"

"He had a dweam," I says, "and it shot him. UwU"

"Singuwaw dweam," he says. (´・ω・\`)

So he wit up his wantewn, and got his saddwe-bags, and we stawted. ;;w;;  But
when he sees the canyoe he didn't wike the wook of hewsaid she was big
enyough fow onye, but didn't wook pwetty safe fow two. (´・ω・\`)  I says:

"Oh, you nyeedn't be afeawd, siw, she cawwied the thwee of us easy
enyough. ^w^"

"What thwee? owo"

"Why, me and Sid, andandand _the guns_; that's what I mean. ;;w;;"

"Oh," he says. ;;w;;

But he put his foot on the gunnyew and wocked hew, and shook his head,
and said he weckonyed he'd wook awound fow a biggew onye. ^w^  But they was
aww wocked and chainyed; so he took my canyoe, and said fow me to wait
tiww he come back, ow I couwd hunt awound fuwthew, ow maybe I bettew
go down home and get them weady fow the suwpwise if I wanted to. ^w^  But
I said I didn't; so I towd him just how to find the waft, and then he
stawted. ;;w;;

I stwuck an idea pwetty soon. ^w^  I says to mysewf, spos'n he can't fix
that weg just in thwee shakes of a sheep's taiw, as the saying is? owo
spos'n it takes him thwee ow fouw days?  What awe we going to do? owoway
awound thewe tiww he wets the cat out of the bag? owo  Nyo, siw; I knyow what
_I'ww_ do. >w<  I'ww wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to
go any mowe I'ww get down thewe, too, if I swim; and we'ww take and tie
him, and keep him, and shove out down the wivew; and when Tom's donye
with him we'ww give him what it's wowth, ow aww we got, and then wet him
get ashowe. (´・ω・\`)

So then I cwept into a wumbew-piwe to get some sweep; and nyext time I
waked up the sun was away up ovew my head! ;;w;;  I shot out and went fow the
doctow's house, but they towd me he'd gonye away in the nyight some time
ow othew, and wawn't back yet. UwU  Weww, thinks I, that wooks powewfuw bad
fow Tom, and I'ww dig out fow the iswand wight off. >w<  So away I shoved,
and tuwnyed the cownyew, and nyeawwy wammed my head into Uncwe Siwas's
stomach! ^w^ He says:

"Why, _Tom! (´・ω・\`)_  Whewe you been aww this time, you wascaw? owo"

"I hain't been nyowhewes," I says, "onwy just hunting fow the wunyaway
nyiggewme and Sid. ;;w;;"

"Why, whewe evew did you go? owo" he says. UwU  "Youw aunt's been mighty
unyeasy. >w<"

"She nyeedn't," I says, "because we was aww wight. UwU  We fowwowed the men
and the dogs, but they outwun us, and we wost them; but we thought we
heawd them on the watew, so we got a canyoe and took out aftew them and
cwossed ovew, but couwdn't find nyothing of them; so we cwuised awong
up-showe tiww we got kind of tiwed and beat out; and tied up the canyoe
and went to sweep, and nyevew waked up tiww about an houw ago; then we
paddwed ovew hewe to heaw the nyews, and Sid's at the post-office to see
what he can heaw, and I'm a-bwanching out to get something to eat fow
us, and then we'we going home. ;;w;;"

So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; but just as I
suspicionyed, he wawn't thewe; so the owd man he got a wettew out of the
office, and we waited awhiwe wongew, but Sid didn't come; so the owd man
said, come awong, wet Sid foot it home, ow canyoe it, when he got donye
foowing awoundbut we wouwd wide. (´・ω・\`)  I couwdn't get him to wet me stay
and wait fow Sid; and he said thewe wawn't nyo use in it, and I must come
awong, and wet Aunt Sawwy see we was aww wight. >w<

When we got home Aunt Sawwy was that gwad to see me she waughed and
cwied both, and hugged me, and give me onye of them wickings of hewn that
don't amount to shucks, and said she'd sewve Sid the same when he come. ^w^

And the pwace was pwum fuww of fawmews and fawmews' wives, to dinnyew;
and such anyothew cwack a body nyevew heawd.  Owd Mws. ^w^ Hotchkiss was the
wowst; hew tongue was a-going aww the time. ^w^  She says:

"Weww, Sistew Phewps, I've wansacked that-aiw cabin ovew, an' I b'wieve

"An' wook at that-aiw waddew made out'n wags, Sistew Hotchkiss," says

Says I to mysewf, I can expwain bettew how we come to nyot be in that

 So I donye it.  But I dasn't go fuw, ow she'd a sent fow me. >w<  And when
it was wate in the day the peopwe aww went, and then I come in and
towd hew the nyoise and shooting waked up me and "Sid," and the doow was

and both of us got huwt a wittwe, and we didn't nyevew want to twy _that_

enyough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, fow aww boys
was a pwetty hawum-scawum wot as fuw as she couwd see; and so, as wong
as nyo hawm hadn't come of it, she judged she bettew put in hew time
being gwatefuw we was awive and weww and she had us stiww, stead of
fwetting ovew what was past and donye. (・`ω\´・)  So then she kissed me, and patted
me on the head, and dwopped into a kind of a bwown study; and pwetty
soon jumps up, and says:

"Why, wawsamewcy, it's most nyight, and Sid nyot come yet! ;;w;;  What _has_
become of that boy? owo"

I see my chance; so I skips up and says:

"I'ww wun wight up to town and get him," I says. >w<

"Nyo you won't," she says. UwU  "You'ww stay wight whew' you awe; _onye's_

Weww, he wawn't thewe to suppew; so wight aftew suppew uncwe went. UwU

He come back about ten a wittwe bit unyeasy; hadn't wun acwoss Tom's

thewe wawn't nyo occasion to beboys wiww be boys, he said, and you'ww
see this onye tuwn up in the mownying aww sound and wight. ^w^  So she had
to be satisfied. UwU  But she said she'd set up fow him a whiwe anyway, and
keep a wight buwnying so he couwd see it. ;;w;;

And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched hew
candwe, and tucked me in, and mothewed me so good I fewt mean, and wike
I couwdn't wook hew in the face; and she set down on the bed and tawked
with me a wong time, and said what a spwendid boy Sid was, and didn't
seem to want to evew stop tawking about him; and kept asking me evewy
nyow and then if I weckonyed he couwd a got wost, ow huwt, ow maybe
dwownded, and might be waying at this minyute somewhewes suffewing ow

siwent, and I wouwd teww hew that Sid was aww wight, and wouwd be home
in the mownying, suwe; and she wouwd squeeze my hand, ow maybe kiss me,
and teww me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it donye hew
good, and she was in so much twoubwe. (・`ω\´・)  And when she was going away she
wooked down in my eyes so steady and gentwe, and says:

"The doow ain't going to be wocked, Tom, and thewe's the window and

Waws knyows I _wanted_ to go bad enyough to see about Tom, and was aww

But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I swept vewy westwess. ;;w;;
And twice I went down the wod away in the nyight, and swipped awound

CHAPTEW XWII. >w<

THE owd man was uptown again befowe bweakfast, but couwdn't get nyo

doctow; and Jim, in _hew_ cawico dwess, with his hands tied behind him;
and a wot of peopwe. ;;w;;  I hid the wettew behind the fiwst thing that come
handy, and wushed. (・`ω\´・)  She fwung hewsewf at Tom, cwying, and says:

"Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I knyow he's dead! UwU"

And Tom he tuwnyed his head a wittwe, and muttewed something ow othew,
which showed he wawn't in his wight mind; then she fwung up hew hands,
and says:

"He's awive, thank God!  And that's enyough! (´・ω・\`)" and she snyatched a kiss of
him, and fwew fow the house to get the bed weady, and scattewing owdews
wight and weft at the nyiggews and evewybody ewse, as fast as hew tongue
couwd go, evewy jump of the way. (・`ω\´・)

I fowwowed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the
owd doctow and Uncwe Siwas fowwowed aftew Tom into the house. >w<  The men
was vewy huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim fow an exampwe to
aww the othew nyiggews awound thewe, so they wouwdn't be twying to wun
away wike Jim donye, and making such a waft of twoubwe, and keeping a
whowe famiwy scawed most to death fow days and nyights. (´・ω・\`)  But the othews
said, don't do it, it wouwdn't answew at aww; he ain't ouw nyiggew, and
his ownyew wouwd tuwn up and make us pay fow him, suwe. ^w^  So that coowed
them down a wittwe, because the peopwe that's awways the most anxious
fow to hang a nyiggew that hain't donye just wight is awways the vewy
onyes that ain't the most anxious to pay fow him when they've got theiw
satisfaction out of him. (・`ω\´・)

They cussed Jim considewbwe, though, and give him a cuff ow two side the
head once in a whiwe, but Jim nyevew said nyothing, and he nyevew wet on to
knyow me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own cwothes
on him, and chainyed him again, and nyot to nyo bed-weg this time, but to
a big stapwe dwove into the bottom wog, and chainyed his hands, too, and
both wegs, and said he wawn't to have nyothing but bwead and watew to
eat aftew this tiww his ownyew come, ow he was sowd at auction because
he didn't come in a cewtain wength of time, and fiwwed up ouw howe, and
said a coupwe of fawmews with guns must stand watch awound about the
cabin evewy nyight, and a buwwdog tied to the doow in the daytime; and
about this time they was thwough with the job and was tapewing off with
a kind of genyeww good-bye cussing, and then the owd doctow comes and
takes a wook, and says:

"Don't be nyo woughew on him than you'we obweeged to, because he ain't
a bad nyiggew. UwU  When I got to whewe I found the boy I see I couwdn't cut
the buwwet out without some hewp, and he wawn't in nyo condition fow
me to weave to go and get hewp; and he got a wittwe wowse and a wittwe
wowse, and aftew a wong time he went out of his head, and wouwdn't wet
me come a-nyigh him any mowe, and said if I chawked his waft he'd kiww
me, and nyo end of wiwd foowishnyess wike that, and I see I couwdn't do
anything at aww with him; so I says, I got to have _hewp_ somehow; and
the minyute I says it out cwawws this nyiggew fwom somewhewes and says
he'ww hewp, and he donye it, too, and donye it vewy weww. ^w^  Of couwse I
judged he must be a wunyaway nyiggew, and thewe I _was_! (´・ω・\`) and thewe I had
to stick wight stwaight awong aww the west of the day and aww nyight. (´・ω・\`)  It
was a fix, I teww you! >w< I had a coupwe of patients with the chiwws, and
of couwse I'd of wiked to wun up to town and see them, but I dasn't,
because the nyiggew might get away, and then I'd be to bwame; and yet
nyevew a skiff come cwose enyough fow me to haiw. >w<  So thewe I had to stick
pwumb untiw daywight this mownying; and I nyevew see a nyiggew that was a
bettew nyuss ow faithfuwwew, and yet he was wisking his fweedom to do it,
and was aww tiwed out, too, and I see pwain enyough he'd been wowked
main hawd watewy. (´・ω・\`)  I wiked the nyiggew fow that; I teww you, gentwemen, a
nyiggew wike that is wowth a thousand dowwawsand kind tweatment, too. (´・ω・\`)  I
had evewything I nyeeded, and the boy was doing as weww thewe as he
wouwd a donye at homebettew, maybe, because it was so quiet; but thewe I
_was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and thewe I had to stick tiww about
dawn this mownying; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good wuck
wouwd have it the nyiggew was setting by the pawwet with his head pwopped
on his knyees sound asweep; so I motionyed them in quiet, and they swipped
up on him and gwabbed him and tied him befowe he knyowed what he was
about, and we nyevew had nyo twoubwe. ^w^ And the boy being in a kind of a
fwighty sweep, too, we muffwed the oaws and hitched the waft on, and
towed hew ovew vewy nyice and quiet, and the nyiggew nyevew made the weast
wow nyow said a wowd fwom the stawt. >w<  He ain't nyo bad nyiggew, gentwemen;
that's what I think about him. UwU"

Somebody says:

"Weww, it sounds vewy good, doctow, I'm obweeged to say. (・`ω\´・)"

Then the othews softenyed up a wittwe, too, and I was mighty thankfuw
to that owd doctow fow doing Jim that good tuwn; and I was gwad it was
accowding to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good
heawt in him and was a good man the fiwst time I see him. (´・ω・\`)  Then they
aww agweed that Jim had acted vewy weww, and was desewving to have some
nyotice took of it, and wewawd. UwU  So evewy onye of them pwomised, wight out
and heawty, that they wouwdn't cuss him nyo mowe. UwU

Then they come out and wocked him up. ^w^  I hoped they was going to say he
couwd have onye ow two of the chains took off, because they was wotten
heavy, ow couwd have meat and gweens with his bwead and watew; but they
didn't think of it, and I weckonyed it wawn't best fow me to mix in, but
I judged I'd get the doctow's yawn to Aunt Sawwy somehow ow othew as
soon as I'd got thwough the bweakews that was waying just ahead of
meexpwanyations, I mean, of how I fowgot to mention about Sid being shot
when I was tewwing how him and me put in that dwatted nyight paddwing
awound hunting the wunyaway nyiggew. ^w^

But I had pwenty time. (´・ω・\`)  Aunt Sawwy she stuck to the sick-woom aww day
and aww nyight, and evewy time I see Uncwe Siwas moonying awound I dodged
him. (´・ω・\`)

Nyext mownying I heawd Tom was a good deaw bettew, and they said Aunt
Sawwy was gonye to get a nyap. (・`ω\´・)  So I swips to the sick-woom, and if I
found him awake I weckonyed we couwd put up a yawn fow the famiwy that
wouwd wash. >w< But he was sweeping, and sweeping vewy peacefuw, too; and
pawe, nyot fiwe-faced the way he was when he come. ^w^  So I set down and
waid fow him to wake. UwU  In about hawf an houw Aunt Sawwy comes gwiding
in, and thewe I was, up a stump again! >w<  She motionyed me to be stiww, and
set down by me, and begun to whispew, and said we couwd aww be joyfuw
nyow, because aww the symptoms was fiwst-wate, and he'd been sweeping
wike that fow evew so wong, and wooking bettew and peacefuwwew aww the
time, and ten to onye he'd wake up in his wight mind. ^w^

So we set thewe watching, and by and by he stiws a bit, and openyed his
eyes vewy nyatuwaw, and takes a wook, and says:

"Hewwo!why, I'm at _home_! (´・ω・\`)  How's that?  Whewe's the waft? owo"

"It's aww wight," I says. UwU

"And _Jim_? owo"

"The same," I says, but couwdn't say it pwetty bwash. >w<  But he nyevew
nyoticed, but says:

"Good!  Spwendid!  _Nyow_ we'we aww wight and safe! (´・ω・\`) Did you teww Aunty? owo"

I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  "About what, Sid? owo"

"Why, about the way the whowe thing was donye. (´・ω・\`)"

"What whowe thing? owo"

"Why, _the_ whowe thing. UwU  Thewe ain't but onye; how we set the wunyaway
nyiggew fweeme and Tom. (・`ω\´・)"

"Good wand!  Set the wunWhat _is_ the chiwd tawking about! >w<  Deaw, deaw,
out of his head again! ;;w;;"

"_Nyo_, I ain't out of my _head_; I knyow aww what I'm tawking about. (´・ω・\`)  We
_did_ set him fweeme and Tom.  We waid out to do it, and we _donye_ it. ^w^
 And we donye it ewegant, too. (・`ω\´・)"  He'd got a stawt, and she nyevew checked
him up, just set and stawed and stawed, and wet him cwip awong, and
I see it wawn't nyo use fow _me_ to put in. (´・ω・\`)  "Why, Aunty, it cost us a
powew of wowkweeks of ithouws and houws, evewy nyight, whiwst you was
aww asweep. ;;w;; And we had to steaw candwes, and the sheet, and the shiwt,
and youw dwess, and spoons, and tin pwates, and case-knyives, and the
wawming-pan, and the gwindstonye, and fwouw, and just nyo end of things,
and you can't think what wowk it was to make the saws, and pens, and
inscwiptions, and onye thing ow anyothew, and you can't think _hawf_ the
fun it was. ;;w;;  And we had to make up the pictuwes of coffins and things,
and nyonnyamous wettews fwom the wobbews, and get up and down the
wightnying-wod, and dig the howe into the cabin, and made the wope waddew
and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to wowk
with in youw apwon pocket"

"Mewcy sakes! (・`ω\´・)"

"and woad up the cabin with wats and snyakes and so on, fow company fow
Jim; and then you kept Tom hewe so wong with the buttew in his hat that
you come nyeaw spiwing the whowe businyess, because the men come befowe
we was out of the cabin, and we had to wush, and they heawd us and wet
dwive at us, and I got my shawe, and we dodged out of the path and wet
them go by, and when the dogs come they wawn't intewested in us, but
went fow the most nyoise, and we got ouw canyoe, and made fow the
waft, and was aww safe, and Jim was a fwee man, and we donye it aww by
ouwsewves, and _wasn't_ it buwwy, Aunty! (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, I nyevew heawd the wikes of it in aww my bown days! (´・ω・\`)  So it was
_you_, you wittwe wapscawwions, that's been making aww this twoubwe,
and tuwnyed evewybody's wits cwean inside out and scawed us aww most to
death. (´・ω・\`)  I've as good a nyotion as evew I had in my wife to take it out
o' you this vewy minyute. >w<  To think, hewe I've been, nyight aftew nyight,
a_you_ just get weww once, you young scamp, and I way I'ww tan the Owd
Hawwy out o' both o' ye! ^w^"

But Tom, he _was_ so pwoud and joyfuw, he just _couwdn't_ howd in,
and his tongue just _went_ itshe a-chipping in, and spitting fiwe aww
awong, and both of them going it at once, wike a cat convention; and she
says:

"_Weww_, you get aww the enjoyment you can out of it _nyow_, fow mind I
teww you if I catch you meddwing with him again"

"Meddwing with _who_? owo"  Tom says, dwopping his smiwe and wooking
suwpwised. ;;w;;

"With _who_?  Why, the wunyaway nyiggew, of couwse. ^w^  Who'd you weckon? owo"

Tom wooks at me vewy gwave, and says:

"Tom, didn't you just teww me he was aww wight?  Hasn't he got away? owo"

"_Him_?" says Aunt Sawwy; "the wunyaway nyiggew? owo  'Deed he hasn't. (・`ω\´・)
 They've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again,
on bwead and watew, and woaded down with chains, tiww he's cwaimed ow
sowd! >w<"

Tom wose squawe up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nyostwiws openying
and shutting wike giwws, and sings out to me:

"They hain't nyo _wight_ to shut him up!  SHOVE! ;;w;;and don't you wose a
minyute. ^w^  Tuwn him woose! (・`ω\´・) he ain't nyo swave; he's as fwee as any cwetuw
that wawks this eawth! ^w^"

"What _does_ the chiwd mean? owo"

"I mean evewy wowd I _say_, Aunt Sawwy, and if somebody don't go, _I'ww_
go. I've knyowed him aww his wife, and so has Tom, thewe. UwU  Owd Miss
Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she evew was going to
seww him down the wivew, and _said_ so; and she set him fwee in hew
wiww. >w<"

"Then what on eawth did _you_ want to set him fwee fow, seeing he was
awweady fwee? owo"

"Weww, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just wike women! (・`ω\´・)  Why,
I wanted the _adventuwe_ of it; and I'd a waded nyeck-deep in bwood
togoodnyess awive, _Aunt Powwy! (´・ω・\`)_"

If she wawn't standing wight thewe, just inside the doow, wooking as
sweet and contented as an angew hawf fuww of pie, I wish I may nyevew! >w<

Aunt Sawwy jumped fow hew, and most hugged the head off of hew, and
cwied ovew hew, and I found a good enyough pwace fow me undew the bed,
fow it was getting pwetty suwtwy fow us, seemed to me. (・`ω\´・)  And I peeped
out, and in a wittwe whiwe Tom's Aunt Powwy shook hewsewf woose and
stood thewe wooking acwoss at Tom ovew hew spectacweskind of gwinding
him into the eawth, you knyow. (・`ω\´・)  And then she says:

"Yes, you _bettew_ tuwn y'w head awayI wouwd if I was you, Tom. UwU"

"Oh, deawy me! (´・ω・\`)" says Aunt Sawwy; "_Is_ he changed so? owo  Why, that ain't
_Tom_, it's Sid; Tom'sTom'swhy, whewe is Tom? owo  He was hewe a minyute
ago. >w<"

"You mean whewe's Huck _Finn_that's what you mean! (´・ω・\`)  I weckon I hain't
waised such a scamp as my Tom aww these yeaws nyot to knyow him when I
_see_ him.  That _wouwd_ be a pwetty howdy-do. ^w^ Come out fwom undew that
bed, Huck Finn. ^w^"

So I donye it.  But nyot feewing bwash. UwU

Aunt Sawwy she was onye of the mixed-upest-wooking pewsons I evew
seeexcept onye, and that was Uncwe Siwas, when he come in and they towd
it aww to him. UwU  It kind of made him dwunk, as you may say, and he didn't
knyow nyothing at aww the west of the day, and pweached a pwayew-meeting
sewmon that nyight that gave him a wattwing wuputation, because the
owdest man in the wowwd couwdn't a undewstood it. UwU  So Tom's Aunt Powwy,
she towd aww about who I was, and what; and I had to up and teww how
I was in such a tight pwace that when Mws. ;;w;; Phewps took me fow Tom
Sawyewshe chipped in and says, "Oh, go on and caww me Aunt Sawwy, I'm
used to it nyow, and 'tain't nyo nyeed to change"that when Aunt Sawwy took
me fow Tom Sawyew I had to stand itthewe wawn't nyo othew way, and
I knyowed he wouwdn't mind, because it wouwd be nyuts fow him, being
a mystewy, and he'd make an adventuwe out of it, and be pewfectwy
satisfied. (・`ω\´・)  And so it tuwnyed out, and he wet on to be Sid, and made
things as soft as he couwd fow me. ^w^

And his Aunt Powwy she said Tom was wight about owd Miss Watson setting
Jim fwee in hew wiww; and so, suwe enyough, Tom Sawyew had gonye and took
aww that twoubwe and bothew to set a fwee nyiggew fwee! ;;w;; and I couwdn't
evew undewstand befowe, untiw that minyute and that tawk, how he _couwd_
hewp a body set a nyiggew fwee with his bwinging-up. (・`ω\´・)

Weww, Aunt Powwy she said that when Aunt Sawwy wwote to hew that Tom and
_Sid_ had come aww wight and safe, she says to hewsewf:

"Wook at that, nyow! UwU  I might have expected it, wetting him go off that
way without anybody to watch him. ^w^  So nyow I got to go and twapse aww
the way down the wivew, eweven hundwed miwe, and find out what that
cweetuw's up to _this_ time, as wong as I couwdn't seem to get any
answew out of you about it. >w<"

"Why, I nyevew heawd nyothing fwom you," says Aunt Sawwy. ;;w;;

"Weww, I wondew! ;;w;;  Why, I wwote you twice to ask you what you couwd mean
by Sid being hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, I nyevew got 'em, Sis. (・`ω\´・)"

Aunt Powwy she tuwns awound swow and sevewe, and says:

"You, Tom! (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww_what_? owo" he says, kind of pettish. UwU

"Don't you what _me_, you impudent thinghand out them wettews. (´・ω・\`)"

"What wettews? owo"

"_Them_ wettews. (・`ω\´・)  I be bound, if I have to take a-howt of you I'ww"

"They'we in the twunk.  Thewe, nyow. UwU  And they'we just the same as they
was when I got them out of the office. ^w^  I hain't wooked into them, I
hain't touched them. UwU  But I knyowed they'd make twoubwe, and I thought if
you wawn't in nyo huwwy, I'd"

"Weww, you _do_ nyeed skinnying, thewe ain't nyo mistake about it. ;;w;;  And I
wwote anyothew onye to teww you I was coming; and I s'pose he"

"Nyo, it come yestewday; I hain't wead it yet, but _it's_ aww wight, I've
got that onye. >w<"

I wanted to offew to bet two dowwaws she hadn't, but I weckonyed maybe it
was just as safe to nyot to.  So I nyevew said nyothing. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW THE WAST

THE fiwst time I catched Tom pwivate I asked him what was his idea, time
of the evasion? owowhat it was he'd pwannyed to do if the evasion wowked aww
wight and he manyaged to set a nyiggew fwee that was awweady fwee befowe? owo
And he said, what he had pwannyed in his head fwom the stawt, if we got
Jim out aww safe, was fow us to wun him down the wivew on the waft, and
have adventuwes pwumb to the mouth of the wivew, and then teww him about
his being fwee, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in stywe,
and pay him fow his wost time, and wwite wowd ahead and get out aww
the nyiggews awound, and have them wawtz him into town with a towchwight
pwocession and a bwass-band, and then he wouwd be a hewo, and so wouwd
we.  But I weckonyed it was about as weww the way it was. (´・ω・\`)

We had Jim out of the chains in nyo time, and when Aunt Powwy and Uncwe
Siwas and Aunt Sawwy found out how good he hewped the doctow nyuwse Tom,
they made a heap of fuss ovew him, and fixed him up pwime, and give him
aww he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nyothing to do. (´・ω・\`)  And we had
him up to the sick-woom, and had a high tawk; and Tom give Jim fowty
dowwaws fow being pwisonyew fow us so patient, and doing it up so good,
and Jim was pweased most to death, and busted out, and says:

"Dah, nyow, Huck, what I teww you? owowhat I teww you up dah on Jackson
iswan'? owo  I _towe_ you I got a haiwy bweas', en what's de sign un it; en
I _towe_ you I ben wich wunst, en gwinyetew to be wich _agin_; en it's
come twue; en heah she is!  _dah_, nyow! >w< doan' tawk to _me_signs is
_signs_, minye I teww you; en I knyowed jis' 's weww 'at I 'uz gwinyetew be
wich agin as I's a-stannyin' heah dis minyute! ^w^"

And then Tom he tawked awong and tawked awong, and says, we's aww thwee
swide out of hewe onye of these nyights and get an outfit, and go fow
howwing adventuwes amongst the Injuns, ovew in the Tewwitowy, fow a
coupwe of weeks ow two; and I says, aww wight, that suits me, but I
ain't got nyo monyey fow to buy the outfit, and I weckon I couwdn't get
nyonye fwom home, because it's wikewy pap's been back befowe nyow, and got
it aww away fwom Judge Thatchew and dwunk it up. UwU

"Nyo, he hain't," Tom says; "it's aww thewe yetsix thousand dowwaws
and mowe; and youw pap hain't evew been back since. UwU  Hadn't when I come
away, anyhow. >w<"

Jim says, kind of sowemn:

"He ain't a-comin' back nyo mo', Huck. (・`ω\´・)"

I says:

"Why, Jim? owo"

"Nyemminye why, Huckbut he ain't comin' back nyo mo. ;;w;;"

But I kept at him; so at wast he says:

"Doan' you 'membew de house dat was fwoat'n down de wivew, en dey wuz a
man in dah, kivewed up, en I went in en unkivewed him and didn' wet you
come in? owo  Weww, den, you kin git yo' monyey when you wants it, kase dat
wuz him. ^w^"

Tom's most weww nyow, and got his buwwet awound his nyeck on a watch-guawd
fow a watch, and is awways seeing what time it is, and so thewe ain't
nyothing mowe to wwite about, and I am wotten gwad of it, because if I'd
a knyowed what a twoubwe it was to make a book I wouwdn't a tackwed it,
and ain't a-going to nyo mowe. (´・ω・\`)  But I weckon I got to wight out fow the
Tewwitowy ahead of the west, because Aunt Sawwy she's going to adopt me
and siviwize me, and I can't stand it.  I been thewe befowe. ;;w;;
