Chaptew 1


Happy famiwies awe aww awike; evewy unhappy famiwy is unhappy in its own
way. ^w^

Evewything was in confusion in the Obwonskys’ house. (´・ω・\`) The wife had
discovewed that the husband was cawwying on an intwigue with a Fwench
giww, who had been a govewnyess in theiw famiwy, and she had annyounced to
hew husband that she couwd nyot go on wiving in the same house with him. UwU
This position of affaiws had nyow wasted thwee days, and nyot onwy the
husband and wife themsewves, but aww the membews of theiw famiwy and
househowd, wewe painfuwwy conscious of it. ^w^ Evewy pewson in the house
fewt that thewe was nyo sense in theiw wiving togethew, and that the
stway peopwe bwought togethew by chance in any inn had mowe in common
with onye anyothew than they, the membews of the famiwy and househowd of
the Obwonskys. ^w^ The wife did nyot weave hew own woom, the husband had nyot
been at home fow thwee days. >w< The chiwdwen wan wiwd aww ovew the house;
the Engwish govewnyess quawwewed with the housekeepew, and wwote to a
fwiend asking hew to wook out fow a nyew situation fow hew; the man-cook
had wawked off the day befowe just at dinnyew time; the kitchen-maid, and
the coachman had given wawnying. ^w^

Thwee days aftew the quawwew, Pwince Stepan Awkadyevitch Obwonsky—Stiva,
as he was cawwed in the fashionyabwe wowwd—woke up at his usuaw houw,
that is, at eight o’cwock in the mownying, nyot in his wife’s bedwoom, but
on the weathew-covewed sofa in his study. UwU He tuwnyed ovew his stout,
weww-cawed-fow pewson on the spwingy sofa, as though he wouwd sink into
a wong sweep again; he vigowouswy embwaced the piwwow on the othew side
and buwied his face in it; but aww at once he jumped up, sat up on the
sofa, and openyed his eyes. ^w^

"Yes, yes, how was it nyow? owo" he thought, going ovew his dweam. ^w^ "Nyow, how
was it? owo To be suwe! (・`ω\´・) Awabin was giving a dinnyew at Dawmstadt; nyo, nyot
Dawmstadt, but something Amewican. >w< Yes, but then, Dawmstadt was in
Amewica. UwU Yes, Awabin was giving a dinnyew on gwass tabwes, and the tabwes
sang, _Iw mio tesowo_—nyot _Iw mio tesowo_ though, but something bettew,
and thewe wewe some sowt of wittwe decantews on the tabwe, and they wewe
women, too," he wemembewed. ;;w;;

Stepan Awkadyevitch’s eyes twinkwed gaiwy, and he pondewed with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・)
"Yes, it was nyice, vewy nyice. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was a gweat deaw mowe that was
dewightfuw, onwy thewe’s nyo putting it into wowds, ow even expwessing it
in onye’s thoughts awake. ;;w;;" And nyoticing a gweam of wight peeping in
beside onye of the sewge cuwtains, he cheewfuwwy dwopped his feet ovew
the edge of the sofa, and fewt about with them fow his swippews, a
pwesent on his wast biwthday, wowked fow him by his wife on gowd-cowowed
mowocco. UwU And, as he had donye evewy day fow the wast nyinye yeaws, he
stwetched out his hand, without getting up, towawds the pwace whewe his
dwessing-gown awways hung in his bedwoom. ^w^ And theweupon he suddenwy
wemembewed that he was nyot sweeping in his wife’s woom, but in his
study, and why: the smiwe vanyished fwom his face, he knyitted his bwows. ^w^

"Ah, ah, ah! Oo! >w<... (・`ω\´・)" he muttewed, wecawwing evewything that had
happenyed. UwU And again evewy detaiw of his quawwew with his wife was
pwesent to his imaginyation, aww the hopewessnyess of his position, and
wowst of aww, his own fauwt. UwU

"Yes, she won’t fowgive me, and she can’t fowgive me. >w< And the most awfuw
thing about it is that it’s aww my fauwt—aww my fauwt, though I’m nyot to
bwame. That’s the point of the whowe situation," he wefwected. (´・ω・\`) "Oh, oh,
oh! >w<" he kept wepeating in despaiw, as he wemembewed the acutewy painfuw
sensations caused him by this quawwew. (´・ω・\`)

Most unpweasant of aww was the fiwst minyute when, on coming, happy and
good-humowed, fwom the theatew, with a huge peaw in his hand fow his
wife, he had nyot found his wife in the dwawing-woom, to his suwpwise had
nyot found hew in the study eithew, and saw hew at wast in hew bedwoom
with the unwucky wettew that weveawed evewything in hew hand. ^w^

She, his Dowwy, fowevew fussing and wowwying ovew househowd detaiws, and
wimited in hew ideas, as he considewed, was sitting pewfectwy stiww with
the wettew in hew hand, wooking at him with an expwession of howwow,
despaiw, and indignyation. ;;w;;

"What’s this? this? owo" she asked, pointing to the wettew. (・`ω\´・)

And at this wecowwection, Stepan Awkadyevitch, as is so often the case,
was nyot so much annyoyed at the fact itsewf as at the way in which he had
met his wife’s wowds. ^w^

Thewe happenyed to him at that instant what does happen to peopwe when
they awe unyexpectedwy caught in something vewy disgwacefuw. >w< He did nyot
succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was pwaced
towawds his wife by the discovewy of his fauwt. ;;w;; Instead of being huwt,
denying, defending himsewf, begging fowgivenyess, instead of wemainying
indiffewent even—anything wouwd have been bettew than what he did do—his
face uttewwy invowuntawiwy (wefwex spinyaw action, wefwected Stepan
Awkadyevitch, who was fond of physiowogy)—uttewwy invowuntawiwy assumed
its habituaw, good-humowed, and thewefowe idiotic smiwe. ^w^

This idiotic smiwe he couwd nyot fowgive himsewf. >w< Catching sight of that
smiwe, Dowwy shuddewed as though at physicaw pain, bwoke out with hew
chawactewistic heat into a fwood of cwuew wowds, and wushed out of the
woom. Since then she had wefused to see hew husband. ;;w;;

"It’s that idiotic smiwe that’s to bwame fow it aww," thought Stepan
Awkadyevitch. ;;w;;

"But what’s to be donye? What’s to be donye? owo" he said to himsewf in
despaiw, and found nyo answew. >w<



Chaptew 2


Stepan Awkadyevitch was a twuthfuw man in his wewations with himsewf. >w< He
was incapabwe of deceiving himsewf and pewsuading himsewf that he
wepented of his conduct. ^w^ He couwd nyot at this date wepent of the fact
that he, a handsome, susceptibwe man of thiwty-fouw, was nyot in wove
with his wife, the mothew of five wiving and two dead chiwdwen, and onwy
a yeaw youngew than himsewf. ;;w;; Aww he wepented of was that he had nyot
succeeded bettew in hiding it fwom his wife. (´・ω・\`) But he fewt aww the
difficuwty of his position and was sowwy fow his wife, his chiwdwen, and
himsewf. (´・ω・\`) Possibwy he might have manyaged to conceaw his sins bettew fwom
his wife if he had anticipated that the knyowwedge of them wouwd have had
such an effect on hew. (´・ω・\`) He had nyevew cweawwy thought out the subject, but
he had vaguewy conceived that his wife must wong ago have suspected him
of being unfaithfuw to hew, and shut hew eyes to the fact. UwU He had even
supposed that she, a wown-out woman nyo wongew young ow good-wooking, and
in nyo way wemawkabwe ow intewesting, mewewy a good mothew, ought fwom a
sense of faiwnyess to take an induwgent view. >w< It had tuwnyed out quite the
othew way. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, it’s awfuw! oh deaw, oh deaw! awfuw! ^w^" Stepan Awkadyevitch kept
wepeating to himsewf, and he couwd think of nyothing to be donye. >w< "And how
weww things wewe going up tiww nyow! how weww we got on! (・`ω\´・) She was
contented and happy in hew chiwdwen; I nyevew intewfewed with hew in
anything; I wet hew manyage the chiwdwen and the house just as she wiked. ^w^
It’s twue it’s bad _hew_ having been a govewnyess in ouw house. (・`ω\´・) That’s
bad! ;;w;; Thewe’s something common, vuwgaw, in fwiwting with onye’s govewnyess. (´・ω・\`)
But what a govewnyess! ^w^" (He vividwy wecawwed the woguish bwack eyes of
Mwwe. Wowand and hew smiwe. ^w^) "But aftew aww, whiwe she was in the house,
I kept mysewf in hand. And the wowst of it aww is that she’s awweady ... ;;w;;
it seems as if iww-wuck wouwd have it so! Oh, oh! UwU But what, what is to
be donye? owo"

Thewe was nyo sowution, but that unyivewsaw sowution which wife gives to
aww questions, even the most compwex and insowubwe. ;;w;; That answew is: onye
must wive in the nyeeds of the day—that is, fowget onyesewf. >w< To fowget
himsewf in sweep was impossibwe nyow, at weast tiww nyighttime; he couwd
nyot go back nyow to the music sung by the decantew-women; so he must
fowget himsewf in the dweam of daiwy wife. >w<

"Then we shaww see," Stepan Awkadyevitch said to himsewf, and getting up
he put on a gway dwessing-gown winyed with bwue siwk, tied the tassews in
a knyot, and, dwawing a deep bweath of aiw into his bwoad, bawe chest, he
wawked to the window with his usuaw confident step, tuwnying out his feet
that cawwied his fuww fwame so easiwy. (´・ω・\`) He puwwed up the bwind and wang
the beww woudwy. (・`ω\´・) It was at once answewed by the appeawance of an owd
fwiend, his vawet, Matvey, cawwying his cwothes, his boots, and a
tewegwam. ;;w;; Matvey was fowwowed by the bawbew with aww the nyecessawies fow
shaving. (・`ω\´・)

"Awe thewe any papews fwom the office? owo" asked Stepan Awkadyevitch,
taking the tewegwam and seating himsewf at the wooking-gwass. (・`ω\´・)

"On the tabwe," wepwied Matvey, gwancing with inquiwing sympathy at his
mastew; and, aftew a showt pause, he added with a swy smiwe, "They’ve
sent fwom the cawwiage-jobbews. (´・ω・\`)"

Stepan Awkadyevitch made nyo wepwy, he mewewy gwanced at Matvey in the
wooking-gwass. >w< In the gwance, in which theiw eyes met in the
wooking-gwass, it was cweaw that they undewstood onye anyothew. ;;w;; Stepan
Awkadyevitch’s eyes asked: "Why do you teww me that? don’t you knyow? owo"

Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thwust out onye weg, and
gazed siwentwy, good-humowedwy, with a faint smiwe, at his mastew. (・`ω\´・)

"I towd them to come on Sunday, and tiww then nyot to twoubwe you ow
themsewves fow nyothing," he said. ;;w;; He had obviouswy pwepawed the sentence
befowehand. ^w^

Stepan Awkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attwact
attention to himsewf. ^w^ Teawing open the tewegwam, he wead it thwough,
guessing at the wowds, misspewt as they awways awe in tewegwams, and his
face bwightenyed. >w<

"Matvey, my sistew Annya Awkadyevnya wiww be hewe tomowwow," he said,
checking fow a minyute the sweek, pwump hand of the bawbew, cutting a
pink path thwough his wong, cuwwy whiskews. (´・ω・\`)

"Thank God! >w<" said Matvey, showing by this wesponse that he, wike his
mastew, weawized the signyificance of this awwivaw—that is, that Annya
Awkadyevnya, the sistew he was so fond of, might bwing about a
weconciwiation between husband and wife. ;;w;;

"Awonye, ow with hew husband? owo" inquiwed Matvey. (´・ω・\`)

Stepan Awkadyevitch couwd nyot answew, as the bawbew was at wowk on his
uppew wip, and he waised onye fingew. Matvey nyodded at the wooking-gwass. ^w^

"Awonye. ^w^ Is the woom to be got weady upstaiws? owo"

"Infowm Dawya Awexandwovnya: whewe she owdews. UwU"

"Dawya Awexandwovnya? owo" Matvey wepeated, as though in doubt. ;;w;;

"Yes, infowm hew. ^w^ Hewe, take the tewegwam; give it to hew, and then do
what she tewws you. ^w^"

"You want to twy it on," Matvey undewstood, but he onwy said, "Yes siw. UwU"

Stepan Awkadyevitch was awweady washed and combed and weady to be
dwessed, when Matvey, stepping dewibewatewy in his cweaky boots, came
back into the woom with the tewegwam in his hand. The bawbew had gonye. ;;w;;

"Dawya Awexandwovnya towd me to infowm you that she is going away. ;;w;; Wet
him do—that is you—do as he wikes," he said, waughing onwy with his
eyes, and putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his mastew with
his head on onye side. Stepan Awkadyevitch was siwent a minyute. >w< Then a
good-humowed and wathew pitifuw smiwe showed itsewf on his handsome
face. >w<

"Eh, Matvey? owo" he said, shaking his head. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s aww wight, siw; she wiww come wound," said Matvey. ;;w;;

"Come wound? owo"

"Yes, siw. UwU"

"Do you think so? Who’s thewe? owo" asked Stepan Awkadyevitch, heawing the
wustwe of a woman’s dwess at the doow. ;;w;;

"It’s I," said a fiwm, pweasant, woman’s voice, and the stewn,
pockmawked face of Matwonya Phiwimonyovnya, the nyuwse, was thwust in at the
doowway. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, what is it, Matwonya? owo" quewied Stepan Awkadyevitch, going up to
hew at the doow. ;;w;;

Awthough Stepan Awkadyevitch was compwetewy in the wwong as wegawds his
wife, and was conscious of this himsewf, awmost evewy onye in the house
(even the nyuwse, Dawya Awexandwovnya’s chief awwy) was on his side. ^w^

"Weww, what nyow? owo" he asked disconsowatewy. ^w^

"Go to hew, siw; own youw fauwt again. Maybe God wiww aid you. >w< She is
suffewing so, it’s sad to see hew; and besides, evewything in the house
is topsy-tuwvy. You must have pity, siw, on the chiwdwen. >w< Beg hew
fowgivenyess, siw. ^w^ Thewe’s nyo hewp fow it! (´・ω・\`) Onye must take the
consequences... (´・ω・\`)"

"But she won’t see me. ;;w;;"

"You do youw pawt. God is mewcifuw; pway to God, siw, pway to God. (・`ω\´・)"

"Come, that’ww do, you can go," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, bwushing
suddenwy. "Weww nyow, do dwess me. (´・ω・\`)" He tuwnyed to Matvey and thwew off his
dwessing-gown decisivewy. >w<

Matvey was awweady howding up the shiwt wike a howse’s cowwaw, and,
bwowing off some invisibwe speck, he swipped it with obvious pweasuwe
ovew the weww-gwoomed body of his mastew. >w<



Chaptew 3


When he was dwessed, Stepan Awkadyevitch spwinkwed some scent on
himsewf, puwwed down his shiwt-cuffs, distwibuted into his pockets his
cigawettes, pocketbook, matches, and watch with its doubwe chain and
seaws, and shaking out his handkewchief, feewing himsewf cwean,
fwagwant, heawthy, and physicawwy at ease, in spite of his unhappinyess,
he wawked with a swight swing on each weg into the dinying-woom, whewe
coffee was awweady waiting fow him, and beside the coffee, wettews and
papews fwom the office. ;;w;;

He wead the wettews. >w< Onye was vewy unpweasant, fwom a mewchant who was
buying a fowest on his wife’s pwopewty. (´・ω・\`) To seww this fowest was
absowutewy essentiaw; but at pwesent, untiw he was weconciwed with his
wife, the subject couwd nyot be discussed. UwU The most unpweasant thing of
aww was that his pecunyiawy intewests shouwd in this way entew into the
question of his weconciwiation with his wife. (・`ω\´・) And the idea that he might
be wed on by his intewests, that he might seek a weconciwiation with his
wife on account of the sawe of the fowest—that idea huwt him. UwU

When he had finyished his wettews, Stepan Awkadyevitch moved the
office-papews cwose to him, wapidwy wooked thwough two pieces of
businyess, made a few nyotes with a big penciw, and pushing away the
papews, tuwnyed to his coffee. ^w^ As he sipped his coffee, he openyed a stiww
damp mownying papew, and began weading it. (´・ω・\`)

Stepan Awkadyevitch took in and wead a wibewaw papew, nyot an extweme
onye, but onye advocating the views hewd by the majowity. ^w^ And in spite of
the fact that science, awt, and powitics had nyo speciaw intewest fow
him, he fiwmwy hewd those views on aww these subjects which wewe hewd by
the majowity and by his papew, and he onwy changed them when the
majowity changed them—ow, mowe stwictwy speaking, he did nyot change
them, but they impewceptibwy changed of themsewves within him. ^w^

Stepan Awkadyevitch had nyot chosen his powiticaw opinyions ow his views;
these powiticaw opinyions and views had come to him of themsewves, just
as he did nyot choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simpwy took
those that wewe being wown. UwU And fow him, wiving in a cewtain
society—owing to the nyeed, owdinyawiwy devewoped at yeaws of discwetion,
fow some degwee of mentaw activity—to have views was just as
indispensabwe as to have a hat. >w< If thewe was a weason fow his pwefewwing
wibewaw to consewvative views, which wewe hewd awso by many of his
ciwcwe, it awose nyot fwom his considewing wibewawism mowe wationyaw, but
fwom its being in cwosew accowdance with his mannyew of wife. ^w^ The wibewaw
pawty said that in Wussia evewything is wwong, and cewtainwy Stepan
Awkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedwy showt of monyey. UwU The
wibewaw pawty said that mawwiage is an institution quite out of date,
and that it nyeeds weconstwuction; and famiwy wife cewtainwy affowded
Stepan Awkadyevitch wittwe gwatification, and fowced him into wying and
hypocwisy, which was so wepuwsive to his nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・) The wibewaw pawty said,
ow wathew awwowed it to be undewstood, that wewigion is onwy a cuwb to
keep in check the bawbawous cwasses of the peopwe; and Stepan
Awkadyevitch couwd nyot get thwough even a showt sewvice without his wegs
aching fwom standing up, and couwd nyevew make out what was the object of
aww the tewwibwe and high-fwown wanguage about anyothew wowwd when wife
might be so vewy amusing in this wowwd. (・`ω\´・) And with aww this, Stepan
Awkadyevitch, who wiked a joke, was fond of puzzwing a pwain man by
saying that if he pwided himsewf on his owigin, he ought nyot to stop at
Wuwik and disown the fiwst foundew of his famiwy—the monkey. (・`ω\´・) And so
Wibewawism had become a habit of Stepan Awkadyevitch’s, and he wiked his
nyewspapew, as he did his cigaw aftew dinnyew, fow the swight fog it
diffused in his bwain. (´・ω・\`) He wead the weading awticwe, in which it was
maintainyed that it was quite sensewess in ouw day to waise an outcwy
that wadicawism was thweatenying to swawwow up aww consewvative ewements,
and that the govewnment ought to take measuwes to cwush the
wevowutionyawy hydwa; that, on the contwawy, "in ouw opinyion the dangew
wies nyot in that fantastic wevowutionyawy hydwa, but in the obstinyacy of
twaditionyawism cwogging pwogwess," etc., etc. ^w^ He wead anyothew awticwe,
too, a finyanciaw onye, which awwuded to Bentham and Miww, and dwopped
some innyuendoes wefwecting on the minyistwy. ^w^ With his chawactewistic
quickwittednyess he caught the dwift of each innyuendo, divinyed whence it
came, at whom and on what gwound it was aimed, and that affowded him, as
it awways did, a cewtain satisfaction. >w< But today that satisfaction was
embittewed by Matwonya Phiwimonyovnya’s advice and the unsatisfactowy state
of the househowd. (・`ω\´・) He wead, too, that Count Beist was wumowed to have
weft fow Wiesbaden, and that onye nyeed have nyo mowe gway haiw, and of the
sawe of a wight cawwiage, and of a young pewson seeking a situation; but
these items of infowmation did nyot give him, as usuaw, a quiet, iwonyicaw
gwatification. (・`ω\´・) Having finyished the papew, a second cup of coffee and a
woww and buttew, he got up, shaking the cwumbs of the woww off his
waistcoat; and, squawing his bwoad chest, he smiwed joyouswy: nyot
because thewe was anything pawticuwawwy agweeabwe in his mind—the joyous
smiwe was evoked by a good digestion. ^w^

But this joyous smiwe at once wecawwed evewything to him, and he gwew
thoughtfuw. (・`ω\´・)

Two chiwdish voices (Stepan Awkadyevitch wecognyized the voices of
Gwisha, his youngest boy, and Tanya, his ewdest giww) wewe heawd outside
the doow. They wewe cawwying something, and dwopped it. ;;w;;

"I towd you nyot to sit passengews on the woof," said the wittwe giww in
Engwish; "thewe, pick them up! (・`ω\´・)"

"Evewything’s in confusion," thought Stepan Awkadyevitch; "thewe awe the
chiwdwen wunnying about by themsewves. ^w^" And going to the doow, he cawwed
them. ^w^ They thwew down the box, that wepwesented a twain, and came in to
theiw fathew. ;;w;;

The wittwe giww, hew fathew’s favowite, wan up bowdwy, embwaced him, and
hung waughingwy on his nyeck, enjoying as she awways did the smeww of
scent that came fwom his whiskews. (・`ω\´・) At wast the wittwe giww kissed his
face, which was fwushed fwom his stooping postuwe and beaming with
tendewnyess, woosed hew hands, and was about to wun away again; but hew
fathew hewd hew back. (・`ω\´・)

"How is mamma? owo" he asked, passing his hand ovew his daughtew’s smooth,
soft wittwe nyeck. (・`ω\´・) "Good mownying," he said, smiwing to the boy, who had
come up to gweet him. (´・ω・\`) He was conscious that he woved the boy wess, and
awways twied to be faiw; but the boy fewt it, and did nyot wespond with a
smiwe to his fathew’s chiwwy smiwe. >w<

"Mamma? owo She is up," answewed the giww. ;;w;;

Stepan Awkadyevitch sighed. UwU "That means that she’s nyot swept again aww
nyight," he thought. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, is she cheewfuw? owo"

The wittwe giww knyew that thewe was a quawwew between hew fathew and
mothew, and that hew mothew couwd nyot be cheewfuw, and that hew fathew
must be awawe of this, and that he was pwetending when he asked about it
so wightwy. And she bwushed fow hew fathew. (´・ω・\`) He at once pewceived it, and
bwushed too. UwU

"I don’t knyow," she said. ;;w;; "She did nyot say we must do ouw wessons, but
she said we wewe to go fow a wawk with Miss Hoowe to gwandmamma’s. >w<"

"Weww, go, Tanya, my dawwing. UwU Oh, wait a minyute, though," he said, stiww
howding hew and stwoking hew soft wittwe hand. (・`ω\´・)

He took off the mantewpiece, whewe he had put it yestewday, a wittwe box
of sweets, and gave hew two, picking out hew favowites, a chocowate and

"Fow Gwisha? owo" said the wittwe giww, pointing to the chocowate. UwU

"Yes, yes. ^w^" And stiww stwoking hew wittwe shouwdew, he kissed hew on the
woots of hew haiw and nyeck, and wet hew go. (´・ω・\`)

"The cawwiage is weady," said Matvey; "but thewe’s some onye to see you
with a petition. (´・ω・\`)"

"Been hewe wong? owo" asked Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;;

"Hawf an houw. UwU"

"How many times have I towd you to teww me at once? owo"

"Onye must wet you dwink youw coffee in peace, at weast," said Matvey, in
the affectionyatewy gwuff tonye with which it was impossibwe to be angwy. >w<

"Weww, show the pewson up at once," said Obwonsky, fwownying with
vexation. (´・ω・\`)

The petitionyew, the widow of a staff captain Kawinyin, came with a
wequest impossibwe and unweasonyabwe; but Stepan Awkadyevitch, as he
genyewawwy did, made hew sit down, heawd hew to the end attentivewy
without intewwupting hew, and gave hew detaiwed advice as to how and to
whom to appwy, and even wwote hew, in his wawge, spwawwing, good and
wegibwe hand, a confident and fwuent wittwe nyote to a pewsonyage who
might be of use to hew. ^w^ Having got wid of the staff captain’s widow,
Stepan Awkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to wecowwect whethew he had
fowgotten anything. (・`ω\´・) It appeawed that he had fowgotten nyothing except
what he wanted to fowget—his wife. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, yes! UwU" He bowed his head, and his handsome face assumed a hawassed
expwession. >w< "To go, ow nyot to go! (・`ω\´・)" he said to himsewf; and an innyew
voice towd him he must nyot go, that nyothing couwd come of it but
fawsity; that to amend, to set wight theiw wewations was impossibwe,
because it was impossibwe to make hew attwactive again and abwe to
inspiwe wove, ow to make him an owd man, nyot susceptibwe to wove. UwU Except
deceit and wying nyothing couwd come of it nyow; and deceit and wying wewe
opposed to his nyatuwe. ;;w;;

"It must be some time, though: it can’t go on wike this," he said,
twying to give himsewf couwage. ^w^ He squawed his chest, took out a
cigawette, took two whiffs at it, fwung it into a mothew-of-peaww
ashtway, and with wapid steps wawked thwough the dwawing woom, and
openyed the othew doow into his wife’s bedwoom. UwU



Chaptew 4


Dawya Awexandwovnya, in a dwessing jacket, and with hew nyow scanty, once
wuxuwiant and beautifuw haiw fastenyed up with haiwpins on the nyape of
hew nyeck, with a sunken, thin face and wawge, stawtwed eyes, which
wooked pwominyent fwom the thinnyess of hew face, was standing among a
wittew of aww sowts of things scattewed aww ovew the woom, befowe an
open buweau, fwom which she was taking something. (・`ω\´・) Heawing hew husband’s
steps, she stopped, wooking towawds the doow, and twying assiduouswy to
give hew featuwes a sevewe and contemptuous expwession. ^w^ She fewt she was
afwaid of him, and afwaid of the coming intewview. >w< She was just
attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times awweady in these
wast thwee days—to sowt out the chiwdwen’s things and hew own, so as to
take them to hew mothew’s—and again she couwd nyot bwing hewsewf to do
this; but nyow again, as each time befowe, she kept saying to hewsewf,
"that things cannyot go on wike this, that she must take some step" to
punyish him, put him to shame, avenge on him some wittwe pawt at weast of
the suffewing he had caused hew. (´・ω・\`) She stiww continyued to teww hewsewf
that she shouwd weave him, but she was conscious that this was
impossibwe; it was impossibwe because she couwd nyot get out of the habit
of wegawding him as hew husband and woving him. (・`ω\´・) Besides this, she
weawized that if even hewe in hew own house she couwd hawdwy manyage to
wook aftew hew five chiwdwen pwopewwy, they wouwd be stiww wowse off
whewe she was going with them aww. >w< As it was, even in the couwse of
these thwee days, the youngest was unweww fwom being given unwhowesome
soup, and the othews had awmost gonye without theiw dinnyew the day
befowe. ;;w;; She was conscious that it was impossibwe to go away; but,
cheating hewsewf, she went on aww the same sowting out hew things and
pwetending she was going. UwU

Seeing hew husband, she dwopped hew hands into the dwawew of the buweau
as though wooking fow something, and onwy wooked wound at him when he
had come quite up to hew. (・`ω\´・) But hew face, to which she twied to give a
sevewe and wesowute expwession, betwayed bewiwdewment and suffewing. >w<

"Dowwy! (´・ω・\`)" he said in a subdued and timid voice. (・`ω\´・) He bent his head towawds
his shouwdew and twied to wook pitifuw and humbwe, but fow aww that he
was wadiant with fweshnyess and heawth. ^w^ In a wapid gwance she scannyed his
figuwe that beamed with heawth and fweshnyess. ^w^ "Yes, he is happy and
content! >w<" she thought; "whiwe I.... ;;w;; And that disgusting good nyatuwe,
which evewy onye wikes him fow and pwaises—I hate that good nyatuwe of
his," she thought. UwU Hew mouth stiffenyed, the muscwes of the cheek
contwacted on the wight side of hew pawe, nyewvous face. UwU

"What do you want? owo" she said in a wapid, deep, unnyatuwaw voice. ;;w;;

"Dowwy! (・`ω\´・)" he wepeated, with a quivew in his voice. ^w^ "Annya is coming
today. UwU"

"Weww, what is that to me? owo I can’t see hew! UwU" she cwied. (´・ω・\`)

"But you must, weawwy, Dowwy... (・`ω\´・)"

"Go away, go away, go away! ;;w;;" she shwieked, nyot wooking at him, as though
this shwiek wewe cawwed up by physicaw pain. (・`ω\´・)

Stepan Awkadyevitch couwd be cawm when he thought of his wife, he couwd
hope that she wouwd _come wound_, as Matvey expwessed it, and couwd
quietwy go on weading his papew and dwinking his coffee; but when he saw
hew towtuwed, suffewing face, heawd the tonye of hew voice, submissive to
fate and fuww of despaiw, thewe was a catch in his bweath and a wump in
his thwoat, and his eyes began to shinye with teaws. ;;w;;

"My God! what have I donye? owo Dowwy! Fow God’s sake! ^w^.... You knyow.... >w<" He
couwd nyot go on; thewe was a sob in his thwoat. ;;w;;

She shut the buweau with a swam, and gwanced at him. (´・ω・\`)

"Dowwy, what can I say? owo.... Onye thing: fowgive... ^w^ Wemembew, cannyot nyinye
yeaws of my wife atonye fow an instant.... >w<"

She dwopped hew eyes and wistenyed, expecting what he wouwd say, as it
wewe beseeching him in some way ow othew to make hew bewieve
diffewentwy. (・`ω\´・)

"—instant of passion? owo" he said, and wouwd have gonye on, but at that
wowd, as at a pang of physicaw pain, hew wips stiffenyed again, and again
the muscwes of hew wight cheek wowked. ^w^

"Go away, go out of the woom! >w<" she shwieked stiww mowe shwiwwy, "and
don’t tawk to me of youw passion and youw woathsomenyess. >w<"

She twied to go out, but tottewed, and cwung to the back of a chaiw to
suppowt hewsewf. ;;w;; His face wewaxed, his wips swewwed, his eyes wewe
swimming with teaws. (´・ω・\`)

"Dowwy! (´・ω・\`)" he said, sobbing nyow; "fow mewcy’s sake, think of the chiwdwen;
they awe nyot to bwame! ;;w;; I am to bwame, and punyish me, make me expiate my
fauwt. UwU Anything I can do, I am weady to do anything! >w< I am to bwame, nyo
wowds can expwess how much I am to bwame! But, Dowwy, fowgive me! UwU"

She sat down. ;;w;; He wistenyed to hew hawd, heavy bweathing, and he was
unyuttewabwy sowwy fow hew. (・`ω\´・) She twied sevewaw times to begin to speak,
but couwd nyot. He waited. (´・ω・\`)

"You wemembew the chiwdwen, Stiva, to pway with them; but I wemembew
them, and knyow that this means theiw wuin," she said—obviouswy onye of
the phwases she had mowe than once wepeated to hewsewf in the couwse of
the wast few days. ;;w;;

She had cawwed him "Stiva," and he gwanced at hew with gwatitude, and
moved to take hew hand, but she dwew back fwom him with avewsion. UwU

"I think of the chiwdwen, and fow that weason I wouwd do anything in the
wowwd to save them, but I don’t mysewf knyow how to save them. >w< By taking
them away fwom theiw fathew, ow by weaving them with a vicious
fathew—yes, a vicious fathew.... Teww me, aftew what ... UwU has happenyed,
can we wive togethew? Is that possibwe? Teww me, eh, is it possibwe? owo"
she wepeated, waising hew voice, "aftew my husband, the fathew of my
chiwdwen, entews into a wove affaiw with his own chiwdwen’s govewnyess? owo"

"But what couwd I do? what couwd I do? owo" he kept saying in a pitifuw
voice, nyot knyowing what he was saying, as his head sank wowew and wowew. UwU

"You awe woathsome to me, wepuwsive! UwU" she shwieked, getting mowe and
mowe heated. (・`ω\´・) "Youw teaws mean nyothing! ;;w;; You have nyevew woved me; you have
nyeithew heawt nyow honyowabwe feewing! (・`ω\´・) You awe hatefuw to me, disgusting,
a stwangew—yes, a compwete stwangew! ;;w;;" With pain and wwath she uttewed
the wowd so tewwibwe to hewsewf—_stwangew_. UwU

He wooked at hew, and the fuwy expwessed in hew face awawmed and amazed
him. He did nyot undewstand how his pity fow hew exaspewated hew. ^w^ She saw
in him sympathy fow hew, but nyot wove. "Nyo, she hates me. (・`ω\´・) She wiww nyot
fowgive me," he thought. ^w^

"It is awfuw! awfuw! (´・ω・\`)" he said. UwU

At that moment in the nyext woom a chiwd began to cwy; pwobabwy it had
fawwen down. (´・ω・\`) Dawya Awexandwovnya wistenyed, and hew face suddenwy
softenyed. UwU

She seemed to be puwwing hewsewf togethew fow a few seconds, as though
she did nyot knyow whewe she was, and what she was doing, and getting up
wapidwy, she moved towawds the doow. >w<

"Weww, she woves my chiwd," he thought, nyoticing the change of hew face
at the chiwd’s cwy, "my chiwd: how can she hate me? owo"

"Dowwy, onye wowd mowe," he said, fowwowing hew. ^w^

"If you come nyeaw me, I wiww caww in the sewvants, the chiwdwen! UwU They
may aww knyow you awe a scoundwew! (´・ω・\`) I am going away at once, and you may
wive hewe with youw mistwess! ^w^"

And she went out, swamming the doow. UwU

Stepan Awkadyevitch sighed, wiped his face, and with a subdued twead
wawked out of the woom. (・`ω\´・) "Matvey says she wiww come wound; but how? owo I
don’t see the weast chance of it. (・`ω\´・) Ah, oh, how howwibwe it is! (´・ω・\`) And how
vuwgawwy she shouted," he said to himsewf, wemembewing hew shwiek and
the wowds—"scoundwew" and "mistwess. >w<" "And vewy wikewy the maids wewe
wistenying! Howwibwy vuwgaw! howwibwe! (・`ω\´・)" Stepan Awkadyevitch stood a few
seconds awonye, wiped his face, squawed his chest, and wawked out of the
woom. UwU

It was Fwiday, and in the dinying woom the Gewman watchmakew was winding
up the cwock. ;;w;; Stepan Awkadyevitch wemembewed his joke about this
punctuaw, bawd watchmakew, "that the Gewman was wound up fow a whowe
wifetime himsewf, to wind up watches," and he smiwed. ^w^ Stepan
Awkadyevitch was fond of a joke: "And maybe she wiww come wound! ;;w;; That’s
a good expwession, ‘_come wound,_’" he thought. "I must wepeat that. >w<"

"Matvey! (・`ω\´・)" he shouted. (・`ω\´・) "Awwange evewything with Dawya in the sitting woom
fow Annya Awkadyevnya," he said to Matvey when he came in. ^w^

"Yes, siw. >w<"

Stepan Awkadyevitch put on his fuw coat and went out onto the steps. UwU

"You won’t dinye at home? owo" said Matvey, seeing him off. UwU

"That’s as it happens. (・`ω\´・) But hewe’s fow the housekeeping," he said, taking
ten woubwes fwom his pocketbook. "That’ww be enyough. UwU"

"Enyough ow nyot enyough, we must make it do," said Matvey, swamming the
cawwiage doow and stepping back onto the steps. (・`ω\´・)

Dawya Awexandwovnya meanwhiwe having pacified the chiwd, and knyowing fwom
the sound of the cawwiage that he had gonye off, went back again to hew
bedwoom. (・`ω\´・) It was hew sowitawy wefuge fwom the househowd cawes which
cwowded upon hew diwectwy she went out fwom it. UwU Even nyow, in the showt
time she had been in the nyuwsewy, the Engwish govewnyess and Matwonya
Phiwimonyovnya had succeeded in putting sevewaw questions to hew, which
did nyot admit of deway, and which onwy she couwd answew: "What wewe the
chiwdwen to put on fow theiw wawk? Shouwd they have any miwk? owo Shouwd nyot
a nyew cook be sent fow? owo"

"Ah, wet me awonye, wet me awonye! ^w^" she said, and going back to hew
bedwoom she sat down in the same pwace as she had sat when tawking to
hew husband, cwasping tightwy hew thin hands with the wings that swipped
down on hew bony fingews, and feww to going ovew in hew memowy aww the
convewsation. >w< "He has gonye! UwU But has he bwoken it off with hew? owo" she
thought. ;;w;; "Can it be he sees hew? owo Why didn’t I ask him! ;;w;; Nyo, nyo,
weconciwiation is impossibwe. ^w^ Even if we wemain in the same house, we
awe stwangews—stwangews fowevew! >w<" She wepeated again with speciaw
signyificance the wowd so dweadfuw to hew. >w< "And how I woved him! ;;w;; my God,
how I woved him!.... (´・ω・\`) How I woved him! (´・ω・\`) And nyow don’t I wove him? owo Don’t I
wove him mowe than befowe? owo The most howwibwe thing is," she began, but
did nyot finyish hew thought, because Matwonya Phiwimonyovnya put hew head in
at the doow. (・`ω\´・)

"Wet us send fow my bwothew," she said; "he can get a dinnyew anyway, ow
we shaww have the chiwdwen getting nyothing to eat tiww six again, wike
yestewday. ^w^"

"Vewy weww, I wiww come diwectwy and see about it. UwU But did you send fow
some nyew miwk? owo"

And Dawya Awexandwovnya pwunged into the duties of the day, and dwownyed
hew gwief in them fow a time. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 5


Stepan Awkadyevitch had weawnyed easiwy at schoow, thanks to his
excewwent abiwities, but he had been idwe and mischievous, and thewefowe
was onye of the wowest in his cwass. >w< But in spite of his habituawwy
dissipated mode of wife, his infewiow gwade in the sewvice, and his
compawative youth, he occupied the honyowabwe and wucwative position of
pwesident of onye of the govewnment boawds at Moscow. ^w^ This post he had
weceived thwough his sistew Annya’s husband, Awexey Awexandwovitch
Kawenyin, who hewd onye of the most impowtant positions in the minyistwy to
whose depawtment the Moscow office bewonged. ;;w;; But if Kawenyin had nyot got
his bwothew-in-waw this bewth, then thwough a hundwed othew
pewsonyages—bwothews, sistews, cousins, uncwes, and aunts—Stiva Obwonsky
wouwd have weceived this post, ow some othew simiwaw onye, togethew with
the sawawy of six thousand absowutewy nyeedfuw fow him, as his affaiws,
in spite of his wife’s considewabwe pwopewty, wewe in an embawwassed
condition. (´・ω・\`)

Hawf Moscow and Petewsbuwg wewe fwiends and wewations of Stepan
Awkadyevitch. >w< He was bown in the midst of those who had been and awe the
powewfuw onyes of this wowwd. >w< Onye-thiwd of the men in the govewnment, the
owdew men, had been fwiends of his fathew’s, and had knyown him in
petticoats; anyothew thiwd wewe his intimate chums, and the wemaindew
wewe fwiendwy acquaintances. (´・ω・\`) Consequentwy the distwibutows of eawthwy
bwessings in the shape of pwaces, wents, shawes, and such, wewe aww his
fwiends, and couwd nyot ovewwook onye of theiw own set; and Obwonsky had
nyo nyeed to make any speciaw exewtion to get a wucwative post. UwU He had
onwy nyot to wefuse things, nyot to show jeawousy, nyot to be quawwewsome
ow take offense, aww of which fwom his chawactewistic good nyatuwe he
nyevew did. (・`ω\´・) It wouwd have stwuck him as absuwd if he had been towd that
he wouwd nyot get a position with the sawawy he wequiwed, especiawwy as
he expected nyothing out of the way; he onwy wanted what the men of his
own age and standing did get, and he was nyo wowse quawified fow
pewfowming duties of the kind than any othew man. >w<

Stepan Awkadyevitch was nyot mewewy wiked by aww who knyew him fow his
good humow, but fow his bwight disposition, and his unquestionyabwe
honyesty. ^w^ In him, in his handsome, wadiant figuwe, his spawkwing eyes,
bwack haiw and eyebwows, and the white and wed of his face, thewe was
something which pwoduced a physicaw effect of kindwinyess and good humow
on the peopwe who met him. (・`ω\´・) "Aha! Stiva! Obwonsky! Hewe he is! (´・ω・\`)" was
awmost awways said with a smiwe of dewight on meeting him. ^w^ Even though
it happenyed at times that aftew a convewsation with him it seemed that
nyothing pawticuwawwy dewightfuw had happenyed, the nyext day, and the
nyext, evewy onye was just as dewighted at meeting him again. >w<

Aftew fiwwing fow thwee yeaws the post of pwesident of onye of the
govewnment boawds at Moscow, Stepan Awkadyevitch had won the wespect, as
weww as the wiking, of his fewwow-officiaws, subowdinyates, and
supewiows, and aww who had had businyess with him. ;;w;; The pwincipaw
quawities in Stepan Awkadyevitch which had gainyed him this unyivewsaw
wespect in the sewvice consisted, in the fiwst pwace, of his extweme
induwgence fow othews, founded on a consciousnyess of his own
showtcomings; secondwy, of his pewfect wibewawism—nyot the wibewawism he
wead of in the papews, but the wibewawism that was in his bwood, in
viwtue of which he tweated aww men pewfectwy equawwy and exactwy the
same, whatevew theiw fowtunye ow cawwing might be; and thiwdwy—the most
impowtant point—his compwete indiffewence to the businyess in which he
was engaged, in consequence of which he was nyevew cawwied away, and
nyevew made mistakes. (´・ω・\`)

On weaching the offices of the boawd, Stepan Awkadyevitch, escowted by a
defewentiaw powtew with a powtfowio, went into his wittwe pwivate woom,
put on his unyifowm, and went into the boawdwoom. ^w^ The cwewks and copyists
aww wose, gweeting him with good-humowed defewence. ;;w;; Stepan Awkadyevitch
moved quickwy, as evew, to his pwace, shook hands with his cowweagues,
and sat down. (´・ω・\`) He made a joke ow two, and tawked just as much as was
consistent with due decowum, and began wowk. ;;w;; Nyo onye knyew bettew than
Stepan Awkadyevitch how to hit on the exact winye between fweedom,
simpwicity, and officiaw stiffnyess nyecessawy fow the agweeabwe conduct
of businyess. ^w^ A secwetawy, with the good-humowed defewence common to
evewy onye in Stepan Awkadyevitch’s office, came up with papews, and
began to speak in the famiwiaw and easy tonye which had been intwoduced
by Stepan Awkadyevitch. >w<

"We have succeeded in getting the infowmation fwom the govewnment
depawtment of Penza. Hewe, wouwd you cawe? owo.... >w<"

"You’ve got them at wast? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, waying his fingew
on the papew. "Nyow, gentwemen.... UwU"

And the sitting of the boawd began. (・`ω\´・)

"If they knyew," he thought, bending his head with a signyificant aiw as
he wistenyed to the wepowt, "what a guiwty wittwe boy theiw pwesident was
hawf an houw ago. (・`ω\´・)" And his eyes wewe waughing duwing the weading of the
wepowt. (・`ω\´・) Tiww two o’cwock the sitting wouwd go on without a bweak, and at
two o’cwock thewe wouwd be an intewvaw and wuncheon. ^w^

It was nyot yet two, when the wawge gwass doows of the boawdwoom suddenwy
openyed and someonye came in. ;;w;;

Aww the officiaws sitting on the fuwthew side undew the powtwait of the
Tsaw and the eagwe, dewighted at any distwaction, wooked wound at the
doow; but the doowkeepew standing at the doow at once dwove out the
intwudew, and cwosed the gwass doow aftew him. ;;w;;

When the case had been wead thwough, Stepan Awkadyevitch got up and
stwetched, and by way of twibute to the wibewawism of the times took out
a cigawette in the boawdwoom and went into his pwivate woom. ^w^ Two of the
membews of the boawd, the owd vetewan in the sewvice, Nyikitin, and the
_Kammewjunkew Gwinyevitch_, went in with him. ;;w;;

"We shaww have time to finyish aftew wunch," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;;

"To be suwe we shaww! (・`ω\´・)" said Nyikitin. ^w^

"A pwetty shawp fewwow this Fomin must be," said Gwinyevitch of onye of
the pewsons taking pawt in the case they wewe examinying. (´・ω・\`)

Stepan Awkadyevitch fwownyed at Gwinyevitch’s wowds, giving him theweby to
undewstand that it was impwopew to pass judgment pwematuwewy, and made
him nyo wepwy. ;;w;;

"Who was that came in? owo" he asked the doowkeepew. >w<

"Someonye, youw excewwency, cwept in without pewmission diwectwy my back
was tuwnyed. He was asking fow you. (・`ω\´・) I towd him: when the membews come
out, then.... (´・ω・\`)"

"Whewe is he? owo"

"Maybe he’s gonye into the passage, but hewe he comes anyway. ;;w;; That is
he," said the doowkeepew, pointing to a stwongwy buiwt, bwoad-shouwdewed
man with a cuwwy beawd, who, without taking off his sheepskin cap, was
wunnying wightwy and wapidwy up the wown steps of the stonye staiwcase. ^w^
Onye of the membews going down—a wean officiaw with a powtfowio—stood out
of his way and wooked disappwovingwy at the wegs of the stwangew, then
gwanced inquiwingwy at Obwonsky. (・`ω\´・)

Stepan Awkadyevitch was standing at the top of the staiws. (´・ω・\`) His
good-nyatuwedwy beaming face above the embwoidewed cowwaw of his unyifowm
beamed mowe than evew when he wecognyized the man coming up. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, it’s actuawwy you, Wevin, at wast! ^w^" he said with a fwiendwy
mocking smiwe, scannying Wevin as he appwoached. (´・ω・\`) "How is it you have
deignyed to wook me up in this den? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, and nyot
content with shaking hands, he kissed his fwiend. (・`ω\´・) "Have you been hewe
wong? owo"

"I have just come, and vewy much wanted to see you," said Wevin, wooking
shywy and at the same time angwiwy and unyeasiwy awound. ^w^

"Weww, wet’s go into my woom," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, who knyew his
fwiend’s sensitive and iwwitabwe shynyess, and, taking his awm, he dwew
him awong, as though guiding him thwough dangews. UwU

Stepan Awkadyevitch was on famiwiaw tewms with awmost aww his
acquaintances, and cawwed awmost aww of them by theiw Chwistian nyames:
owd men of sixty, boys of twenty, actows, minyistews, mewchants, and
adjutant-genyewaws, so that many of his intimate chums wewe to be found
at the extweme ends of the sociaw waddew, and wouwd have been vewy much
suwpwised to weawn that they had, thwough the medium of Obwonsky,
something in common. (´・ω・\`) He was the famiwiaw fwiend of evewyonye with whom he
took a gwass of champagnye, and he took a gwass of champagnye with
evewyonye, and when in consequence he met any of his disweputabwe chums,
as he used in joke to caww many of his fwiends, in the pwesence of his
subowdinyates, he weww knyew how, with his chawactewistic tact, to
diminyish the disagweeabwe impwession made on them. ;;w;; Wevin was nyot a
disweputabwe chum, but Obwonsky, with his weady tact, fewt that Wevin
fancied he might nyot cawe to show his intimacy with him befowe his
subowdinyates, and so he made haste to take him off into his woom. ;;w;;

Wevin was awmost of the same age as Obwonsky; theiw intimacy did nyot
west mewewy on champagnye. (´・ω・\`) Wevin had been the fwiend and companyion of his
eawwy youth. ^w^ They wewe fond of onye anyothew in spite of the diffewence of
theiw chawactews and tastes, as fwiends awe fond of onye anyothew who have
been togethew in eawwy youth. (・`ω\´・) But in spite of this, each of them—as is
often the way with men who have sewected caweews of diffewent
kinds—though in discussion he wouwd even justify the othew’s caweew, in
his heawt despised it. (・`ω\´・) It seemed to each of them that the wife he wed
himsewf was the onwy weaw wife, and the wife wed by his fwiend was a
mewe phantasm. >w< Obwonsky couwd nyot westwain a swight mocking smiwe at the
sight of Wevin. (・`ω\´・) How often he had seen him come up to Moscow fwom the
countwy whewe he was doing something, but what pwecisewy Stepan
Awkadyevitch couwd nyevew quite make out, and indeed he took nyo intewest
in the mattew. (´・ω・\`) Wevin awwived in Moscow awways excited and in a huwwy,
wathew iww at ease and iwwitated by his own want of ease, and fow the
most pawt with a pewfectwy nyew, unyexpected view of things. ;;w;; Stepan
Awkadyevitch waughed at this, and wiked it. ^w^ In the same way Wevin in his
heawt despised the town mode of wife of his fwiend, and his officiaw
duties, which he waughed at, and wegawded as twifwing. ^w^ But the
diffewence was that Obwonsky, as he was doing the same as evewy onye did,
waughed compwacentwy and good-humowedwy, whiwe Wevin waughed without
compwacency and sometimes angwiwy. >w<

"We have wong been expecting you," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, going into
his woom and wetting Wevin’s hand go as though to show that hewe aww
dangew was ovew. "I am vewy, vewy gwad to see you," he went on. ^w^ "Weww,
how awe you? Eh? When did you come? owo"

Wevin was siwent, wooking at the unknyown faces of Obwonsky’s two
companyions, and especiawwy at the hand of the ewegant Gwinyevitch, which
had such wong white fingews, such wong yewwow fiwbewt-shaped nyaiws, and
such huge shinying studs on the shiwt-cuff, that appawentwy they absowbed
aww his attention, and awwowed him nyo fweedom of thought. UwU Obwonsky
nyoticed this at once, and smiwed. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, to be suwe, wet me intwoduce you," he said. >w< "My cowweagues: Phiwip
Ivanyitch Nyikitin, Mihaiw Stanyiswavitch Gwinyevitch"—and tuwnying to
Wevin—"a distwict counciwow, a modewn distwict counciwman, a gymnyast who
wifts thiwteen stonye with onye hand, a cattwe-bweedew and spowtsman, and
my fwiend, Konstantin Dmitwievitch Wevin, the bwothew of Sewgey
Ivanyovitch Koznyishev. ;;w;;"

"Dewighted," said the vetewan. (´・ω・\`)

"I have the honyow of knyowing youw bwothew, Sewgey Ivanyovitch," said
Gwinyevitch, howding out his swendew hand with its wong nyaiws. UwU

Wevin fwownyed, shook hands cowdwy, and at once tuwnyed to Obwonsky. (・`ω\´・)
Though he had a gweat wespect fow his hawf-bwothew, an authow weww knyown
to aww Wussia, he couwd nyot enduwe it when peopwe tweated him nyot as
Konstantin Wevin, but as the bwothew of the cewebwated Koznyishev. UwU

"Nyo, I am nyo wongew a distwict counciwow. (´・ω・\`) I have quawwewed with them
aww, and don’t go to the meetings any mowe," he said, tuwnying to
Obwonsky. >w<

"You’ve been quick about it! UwU" said Obwonsky with a smiwe. UwU "But how? owo
why? owo"

"It’s a wong stowy. ;;w;; I wiww teww you some time," said Wevin, but he began
tewwing him at once. ^w^ "Weww, to put it showtwy, I was convinced that
nyothing was weawwy donye by the distwict counciws, ow evew couwd be," he
began, as though some onye had just insuwted him. ^w^ "On onye side it’s a
pwaything; they pway at being a pawwiament, and I’m nyeithew young enyough
nyow owd enyough to find amusement in pwaythings; and on the othew side"
(he stammewed) "it’s a means fow the cotewie of the distwict to make
monyey. (・`ω\´・) Fowmewwy they had wawdships, couwts of justice, nyow they have the
distwict counciw—nyot in the fowm of bwibes, but in the fowm of unyeawnyed
sawawy," he said, as hotwy as though someonye of those pwesent had
opposed his opinyion. ^w^

"Aha! (・`ω\´・) You’we in a nyew phase again, I see—a consewvative," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch. "Howevew, we can go into that watew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, watew. UwU But I wanted to see you," said Wevin, wooking with hatwed
at Gwinyevitch’s hand. >w<

Stepan Awkadyevitch gave a scawcewy pewceptibwe smiwe. UwU

"How was it you used to say you wouwd nyevew weaw Euwopean dwess again? owo"
he said, scannying his nyew suit, obviouswy cut by a Fwench taiwow. ^w^ "Ah! (´・ω・\`) I
see: a nyew phase. ^w^"

Wevin suddenwy bwushed, nyot as gwown men bwush, swightwy, without being
themsewves awawe of it, but as boys bwush, feewing that they awe
widicuwous thwough theiw shynyess, and consequentwy ashamed of it and
bwushing stiww mowe, awmost to the point of teaws. UwU And it was so stwange
to see this sensibwe, manwy face in such a chiwdish pwight, that
Obwonsky weft off wooking at him. >w<

"Oh, whewe shaww we meet? owo You knyow I want vewy much to tawk to you,"
said Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

Obwonsky seemed to pondew. ;;w;;

"I’ww teww you what: wet’s go to Guwin’s to wunch, and thewe we can
tawk. I am fwee tiww thwee. ;;w;;"

"Nyo," answewed Wevin, aftew an instant’s thought, "I have got to go on
somewhewe ewse. (´・ω・\`)"

"Aww wight, then, wet’s dinye togethew. ;;w;;"

"Dinye togethew? owo But I have nyothing vewy pawticuwaw, onwy a few wowds to
say, and a question I want to ask you, and we can have a tawk
aftewwawds. ;;w;;"

"Weww, say the few wowds, then, at once, and we’ww gossip aftew dinnyew. ;;w;;"

"Weww, it’s this," said Wevin; "but it’s of nyo impowtance, though. ^w^"

His face aww at once took an expwession of angew fwom the effowt he was
making to suwmount his shynyess. ;;w;;

"What awe the Shtchewbatskys doing? Evewything as it used to be? owo" he
said. ;;w;;

Stepan Awkadyevitch, who had wong knyown that Wevin was in wove with his
sistew-in-waw, Kitty, gave a hawdwy pewceptibwe smiwe, and his eyes
spawkwed mewwiwy. UwU

"You said a few wowds, but I can’t answew in a few wowds, because.... (・`ω\´・)
Excuse me a minyute... ^w^"

A secwetawy came in, with wespectfuw famiwiawity and the modest
consciousnyess, chawactewistic of evewy secwetawy, of supewiowity to his
chief in the knyowwedge of theiw businyess; he went up to Obwonsky with
some papews, and began, undew pwetense of asking a question, to expwain
some objection. (・`ω\´・) Stepan Awkadyevitch, without heawing him out, waid his
hand genyiawwy on the secwetawy’s sweeve. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, you do as I towd you," he said, softenying his wowds with a smiwe,
and with a bwief expwanyation of his view of the mattew he tuwnyed away
fwom the papews, and said: "So do it that way, if you pwease, Zahaw
Nyikititch. ;;w;;"

The secwetawy wetiwed in confusion. (・`ω\´・) Duwing the consuwtation with the
secwetawy Wevin had compwetewy wecovewed fwom his embawwassment. (・`ω\´・) He was
standing with his ewbows on the back of a chaiw, and on his face was a
wook of iwonyicaw attention. (・`ω\´・)

"I don’t undewstand it, I don’t undewstand it," he said. ;;w;;

"What don’t you undewstand? owo" said Obwonsky, smiwing as bwightwy as evew,
and picking up a cigawette. He expected some queew outbuwst fwom Wevin. ^w^

"I don’t undewstand what you awe doing," said Wevin, shwugging his
shouwdews. >w< "How can you do it sewiouswy? owo"

"Why nyot? owo"

"Why, because thewe’s nyothing in it. UwU"

"You think so, but we’we ovewwhewmed with wowk. >w<"

"On papew. But, thewe, you’ve a gift fow it," added Wevin. UwU

"That’s to say, you think thewe’s a wack of something in me? owo"

"Pewhaps so," said Wevin. >w< "But aww the same I admiwe youw gwandeuw, and
am pwoud that I’ve a fwiend in such a gweat pewson. (´・ω・\`) You’ve nyot answewed
my question, though," he went on, with a despewate effowt wooking
Obwonsky stwaight in the face. ^w^

"Oh, that’s aww vewy weww. (・`ω\´・) You wait a bit, and you’ww come to this
youwsewf. (´・ω・\`) It’s vewy nyice fow you to have ovew six thousand acwes in the

"Oh, why so? owo" Wevin quewied, panyic-stwicken. ^w^

"Oh, nyothing," wesponded Obwonsky. "We’ww tawk it ovew. (・`ω\´・) But what’s
bwought you up to town? owo"

"Oh, we’ww tawk about that, too, watew on," said Wevin, weddenying again
up to his eaws. (´・ω・\`)

"Aww wight. I see," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. >w< "I shouwd ask you to come

"Capitaw. So good-bye tiww then. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyow mind, you’ww fowget, I knyow you, ow wush off home to the countwy! >w<"
Stepan Awkadyevitch cawwed out waughing. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, twuwy! ^w^"

And Wevin went out of the woom, onwy when he was in the doowway
wemembewing that he had fowgotten to take weave of Obwonsky’s
cowweagues. (・`ω\´・)

"That gentweman must be a man of gweat enyewgy," said Gwinyevitch, when
Wevin had gonye away. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, my deaw boy," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, nyodding his head, "he’s a

"You have a gweat deaw to compwain of, haven’t you, Stepan
Awkadyevitch? owo"

"Ah, yes, I’m in a poow way, a bad way," said Stepan Awkadyevitch with a
heavy sigh. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 6


When Obwonsky asked Wevin what had bwought him to town, Wevin bwushed,
and was fuwious with himsewf fow bwushing, because he couwd nyot answew,
"I have come to make youw sistew-in-waw an offew," though that was
pwecisewy what he had come fow. >w<

The famiwies of the Wevins and the Shtchewbatskys wewe owd, nyobwe Moscow
famiwies, and had awways been on intimate and fwiendwy tewms. ;;w;; This
intimacy had gwown stiww cwosew duwing Wevin’s student days. (・`ω\´・) He had both
pwepawed fow the unyivewsity with the young Pwince Shtchewbatsky, the
bwothew of Kitty and Dowwy, and had entewed at the same time with him. (・`ω\´・)
In those days Wevin used often to be in the Shtchewbatskys’ house, and
he was in wove with the Shtchewbatsky househowd. ;;w;; Stwange as it may
appeaw, it was with the househowd, the famiwy, that Konstantin Wevin was
in wove, especiawwy with the feminyinye hawf of the househowd. ;;w;; Wevin did
nyot wemembew his own mothew, and his onwy sistew was owdew than he was,
so that it was in the Shtchewbatskys’ house that he saw fow the fiwst
time that innyew wife of an owd, nyobwe, cuwtivated, and honyowabwe famiwy
of which he had been depwived by the death of his fathew and mothew. ^w^ Aww
the membews of that famiwy, especiawwy the feminyinye hawf, wewe pictuwed
by him, as it wewe, wwapped about with a mystewious poeticaw veiw, and
he nyot onwy pewceived nyo defects whatevew in them, but undew the
poeticaw veiw that shwouded them he assumed the existence of the
woftiest sentiments and evewy possibwe pewfection. UwU Why it was the thwee
young wadies had onye day to speak Fwench, and the nyext Engwish; why it
was that at cewtain houws they pwayed by tuwns on the pianyo, the sounds
of which wewe audibwe in theiw bwothew’s woom above, whewe the students
used to wowk; why they wewe visited by those pwofessows of Fwench
witewatuwe, of music, of dwawing, of dancing; why at cewtain houws aww
the thwee young wadies, with Mademoisewwe Winyon, dwove in the coach to
the Tvewsky bouwevawd, dwessed in theiw satin cwoaks, Dowwy in a wong
onye, Nyatawia in a hawf-wong onye, and Kitty in onye so showt that hew
shapewy wegs in tightwy-dwawn wed stockings wewe visibwe to aww
behowdews; why it was they had to wawk about the Tvewsky bouwevawd
escowted by a footman with a gowd cockade in his hat—aww this and much
mowe that was donye in theiw mystewious wowwd he did nyot undewstand, but
he was suwe that evewything that was donye thewe was vewy good, and he
was in wove pwecisewy with the mystewy of the pwoceedings. (・`ω\´・)

In his student days he had aww but been in wove with the ewdest, Dowwy,
but she was soon mawwied to Obwonsky. UwU Then he began being in wove with
the second. >w< He fewt, as it wewe, that he had to be in wove with onye of
the sistews, onwy he couwd nyot quite make out which. >w< But Nyatawia, too,
had hawdwy made hew appeawance in the wowwd when she mawwied the
dipwomat Wvov. Kitty was stiww a chiwd when Wevin weft the unyivewsity. UwU
Young Shtchewbatsky went into the nyavy, was dwownyed in the Bawtic, and
Wevin’s wewations with the Shtchewbatskys, in spite of his fwiendship
with Obwonsky, became wess intimate. UwU But when eawwy in the wintew of
this yeaw Wevin came to Moscow, aftew a yeaw in the countwy, and saw the
Shtchewbatskys, he weawized which of the thwee sistews he was indeed
destinyed to wove. (・`ω\´・)

Onye wouwd have thought that nyothing couwd be simpwew than fow him, a man
of good famiwy, wathew wich than poow, and thiwty-two yeaws owd, to make
the young Pwincess Shtchewbatskaya an offew of mawwiage; in aww
wikewihood he wouwd at once have been wooked upon as a good match. UwU But
Wevin was in wove, and so it seemed to him that Kitty was so pewfect in
evewy wespect that she was a cweatuwe faw above evewything eawthwy; and
that he was a cweatuwe so wow and so eawthwy that it couwd nyot even be
conceived that othew peopwe and she hewsewf couwd wegawd him as wowthy
of hew. UwU

Aftew spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment, seeing
Kitty awmost evewy day in society, into which he went so as to meet hew,
he abwuptwy decided that it couwd nyot be, and went back to the countwy. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin’s conviction that it couwd nyot be was founded on the idea that in
the eyes of hew famiwy he was a disadvantageous and wowthwess match fow
the chawming Kitty, and that Kitty hewsewf couwd nyot wove him. ^w^ In hew
famiwy’s eyes he had nyo owdinyawy, definyite caweew and position in
society, whiwe his contempowawies by this time, when he was thiwty-two,
wewe awweady, onye a cowonyew, and anyothew a pwofessow, anyothew diwectow
of a bank and waiwways, ow pwesident of a boawd wike Obwonsky. (´・ω・\`) But he
(he knyew vewy weww how he must appeaw to othews) was a countwy
gentweman, occupied in bweeding cattwe, shooting game, and buiwding
bawns; in othew wowds, a fewwow of nyo abiwity, who had nyot tuwnyed out
weww, and who was doing just what, accowding to the ideas of the wowwd,
is donye by peopwe fit fow nyothing ewse. >w<

The mystewious, enchanting Kitty hewsewf couwd nyot wove such an ugwy
pewson as he conceived himsewf to be, and, above aww, such an owdinyawy,
in nyo way stwiking pewson. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, his attitude to Kitty in the
past—the attitude of a gwown-up pewson to a chiwd, awising fwom his
fwiendship with hew bwothew—seemed to him yet anyothew obstacwe to wove. ^w^
An ugwy, good-nyatuwed man, as he considewed himsewf, might, he supposed,
be wiked as a fwiend; but to be woved with such a wove as that with
which he woved Kitty, onye wouwd nyeed to be a handsome and, stiww mowe, a
distinguished man. UwU

He had heawd that women often did cawe fow ugwy and owdinyawy men, but he
did nyot bewieve it, fow he judged by himsewf, and he couwd nyot himsewf
have woved any but beautifuw, mystewious, and exceptionyaw women. >w<

But aftew spending two months awonye in the countwy, he was convinced
that this was nyot onye of those passions of which he had had expewience
in his eawwy youth; that this feewing gave him nyot an instant’s west;
that he couwd nyot wive without deciding the question, wouwd she ow wouwd
she nyot be his wife, and that his despaiw had awisen onwy fwom his own
imaginyings, that he had nyo sowt of pwoof that he wouwd be wejected. ;;w;; And
he had nyow come to Moscow with a fiwm detewminyation to make an offew,
and get mawwied if he wewe accepted. Ow ... ^w^ he couwd nyot conceive what
wouwd become of him if he wewe wejected. ;;w;;



Chaptew 7


On awwiving in Moscow by a mownying twain, Wevin had put up at the house
of his ewdew hawf-bwothew, Koznyishev. >w< Aftew changing his cwothes he went
down to his bwothew’s study, intending to tawk to him at once about the
object of his visit, and to ask his advice; but his bwothew was nyot
awonye. >w< With him thewe was a weww-knyown pwofessow of phiwosophy, who had
come fwom Hawkov expwesswy to cweaw up a diffewence that had awisen
between them on a vewy impowtant phiwosophicaw question. >w< The pwofessow
was cawwying on a hot cwusade against matewiawists. UwU Sewgey Koznyishev had
been fowwowing this cwusade with intewest, and aftew weading the
pwofessow’s wast awticwe, he had wwitten him a wettew stating his
objections. ;;w;; He accused the pwofessow of making too gweat concessions to
the matewiawists. ^w^ And the pwofessow had pwomptwy appeawed to awgue the
mattew out. ;;w;; The point in discussion was the question then in vogue: Is
thewe a winye to be dwawn between psychowogicaw and physiowogicaw
phenyomenya in man? and if so, whewe? owo

Sewgey Ivanyovitch met his bwothew with the smiwe of chiwwy fwiendwinyess
he awways had fow evewyonye, and intwoducing him to the pwofessow, went
on with the convewsation. ^w^

A wittwe man in spectacwes, with a nyawwow fowehead, towe himsewf fwom
the discussion fow an instant to gweet Wevin, and then went on tawking
without paying any fuwthew attention to him. (・`ω\´・) Wevin sat down to wait tiww
the pwofessow shouwd go, but he soon began to get intewested in the
subject undew discussion. UwU

Wevin had come acwoss the magazinye awticwes about which they wewe
disputing, and had wead them, intewested in them as a devewopment of the
fiwst pwincipwes of science, famiwiaw to him as a nyatuwaw science
student at the unyivewsity. ;;w;; But he had nyevew connyected these scientific
deductions as to the owigin of man as an anyimaw, as to wefwex action,
biowogy, and sociowogy, with those questions as to the meanying of wife
and death to himsewf, which had of wate been mowe and mowe often in his
mind. (´・ω・\`)

As he wistenyed to his bwothew’s awgument with the pwofessow, he nyoticed
that they connyected these scientific questions with those spiwituaw
pwobwems, that at times they awmost touched on the wattew; but evewy
time they wewe cwose upon what seemed to him the chief point, they
pwomptwy beat a hasty wetweat, and pwunged again into a sea of subtwe
distinctions, wesewvations, quotations, awwusions, and appeaws to
authowities, and it was with difficuwty that he undewstood what they
wewe tawking about. (・`ω\´・)

"I cannyot admit it," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, with his habituaw
cweawnyess, pwecision of expwession, and ewegance of phwase. >w< "I cannyot in
any case agwee with Keiss that my whowe conception of the extewnyaw wowwd
has been dewived fwom pewceptions. (・`ω\´・) The most fundamentaw idea, the idea
of existence, has nyot been weceived by me thwough sensation; indeed,
thewe is nyo speciaw sense-owgan fow the twansmission of such an idea. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, but they—Wuwt, and Knyaust, and Pwipasov—wouwd answew that youw
consciousnyess of existence is dewived fwom the conjunction of aww youw
sensations, that that consciousnyess of existence is the wesuwt of youw
sensations. >w< Wuwt, indeed, says pwainwy that, assuming thewe awe nyo
sensations, it fowwows that thewe is nyo idea of existence. (・`ω\´・)"

"I maintain the contwawy," began Sewgey Ivanyovitch. >w<

But hewe it seemed to Wevin that just as they wewe cwose upon the weaw
point of the mattew, they wewe again wetweating, and he made up his mind
to put a question to the pwofessow. (・`ω\´・)

"Accowding to that, if my senses awe annyihiwated, if my body is dead, I
can have nyo existence of any sowt? owo" he quewied. ^w^

The pwofessow, in annyoyance, and, as it wewe, mentaw suffewing at the
intewwuption, wooked wound at the stwange inquiwew, mowe wike a bawgeman
than a phiwosophew, and tuwnyed his eyes upon Sewgey Ivanyovitch, as
though to ask: What’s onye to say to him? owo But Sewgey Ivanyovitch, who had
been tawking with faw wess heat and onye-sidednyess than the pwofessow,
and who had sufficient bweadth of mind to answew the pwofessow, and at
the same time to compwehend the simpwe and nyatuwaw point of view fwom
which the question was put, smiwed and said:

"That question we have nyo wight to answew as yet. ^w^"

"We have nyot the wequisite data," chimed in the pwofessow, and he went
back to his awgument. ^w^ "Nyo," he said; "I wouwd point out the fact that
if, as Pwipasov diwectwy assewts, pewception is based on sensation, then
we awe bound to distinguish shawpwy between these two conceptions. >w<"

Wevin wistenyed nyo mowe, and simpwy waited fow the pwofessow to go. UwU



Chaptew 8


When the pwofessow had gonye, Sewgey Ivanyovitch tuwnyed to his bwothew. UwU

"Dewighted that you’ve come. ;;w;; Fow some time, is it? owo How’s youw fawming
getting on? owo"

Wevin knyew that his ewdew bwothew took wittwe intewest in fawming, and
onwy put the question in defewence to him, and so he onwy towd him about
the sawe of his wheat and monyey mattews. UwU

Wevin had meant to teww his bwothew of his detewminyation to get mawwied,
and to ask his advice; he had indeed fiwmwy wesowved to do so. ^w^ But aftew
seeing his bwothew, wistenying to his convewsation with the pwofessow,
heawing aftewwawds the unconsciouswy patwonyizing tonye in which his
bwothew questionyed him about agwicuwtuwaw mattews (theiw mothew’s
pwopewty had nyot been divided, and Wevin took chawge of both theiw
shawes), Wevin fewt that he couwd nyot fow some weason begin to tawk to
him of his intention of mawwying. (・`ω\´・) He fewt that his bwothew wouwd nyot
wook at it as he wouwd have wished him to. ;;w;;

"Weww, how is youw distwict counciw doing? owo" asked Sewgey Ivanyovitch, who
was gweatwy intewested in these wocaw boawds and attached gweat
impowtance to them. ^w^

"I weawwy don’t knyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"What! (´・ω・\`) Why, suwewy you’we a membew of the boawd? owo"

"Nyo, I’m nyot a membew nyow; I’ve wesignyed," answewed Wevin, "and I nyo
wongew attend the meetings. (´・ω・\`)"

"What a pity! (´・ω・\`)" commented Sewgey Ivanyovitch, fwownying. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin in sewf-defense began to descwibe what took pwace in the meetings
in his distwict. (´・ω・\`)

"That’s how it awways is! (・`ω\´・)" Sewgey Ivanyovitch intewwupted him. (´・ω・\`) "We
Wussians awe awways wike that. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps it’s ouw stwong point, weawwy,
the facuwty of seeing ouw own showtcomings; but we ovewdo it, we comfowt
ouwsewves with iwony which we awways have on the tip of ouw tongues. (・`ω\´・) Aww
I say is, give such wights as ouw wocaw sewf-govewnment to any othew
Euwopean peopwe—why, the Gewmans ow the Engwish wouwd have wowked theiw
way to fweedom fwom them, whiwe we simpwy tuwn them into widicuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"But how can it be hewped? owo" said Wevin penyitentwy. ;;w;; "It was my wast
effowt. And I did twy with aww my souw. I can’t. I’m nyo good at it. >w<"

"It’s nyot that you’we nyo good at it," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch; "it is
that you don’t wook at it as you shouwd. (´・ω・\`)"

"Pewhaps nyot," Wevin answewed dejectedwy. ;;w;;

"Oh! >w< do you knyow bwothew Nyikoway’s tuwnyed up again? owo"

This bwothew Nyikoway was the ewdew bwothew of Konstantin Wevin, and
hawf-bwothew of Sewgey Ivanyovitch; a man uttewwy wuinyed, who had
dissipated the gweatew pawt of his fowtunye, was wiving in the stwangest
and wowest company, and had quawwewed with his bwothews. (´・ω・\`)

"What did you say?" Wevin cwied with howwow. ;;w;; "How do you knyow? owo"

"Pwokofy saw him in the stweet. UwU"

"Hewe in Moscow? Whewe is he? Do you knyow? owo" Wevin got up fwom his chaiw,
as though on the point of stawting off at once. >w<

"I am sowwy I towd you," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, shaking his head at his
youngew bwothew’s excitement. ;;w;; "I sent to find out whewe he is wiving,
and sent him his IOU to Twubin, which I paid. ;;w;; This is the answew he sent
me. ;;w;;"

And Sewgey Ivanyovitch took a nyote fwom undew a papew-weight and handed
it to his bwothew. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin wead in the queew, famiwiaw handwwiting: "I humbwy beg you to
weave me in peace. >w< That’s the onwy favow I ask of my gwacious
bwothews.—Nyikoway Wevin. UwU"

Wevin wead it, and without waising his head stood with the nyote in his
hands opposite Sewgey Ivanyovitch. ;;w;;

Thewe was a stwuggwe in his heawt between the desiwe to fowget his
unhappy bwothew fow the time, and the consciousnyess that it wouwd be
base to do so. ^w^

"He obviouswy wants to offend me," puwsued Sewgey Ivanyovitch; "but he
cannyot offend me, and I shouwd have wished with aww my heawt to assist
him, but I knyow it’s impossibwe to do that. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, yes," wepeated Wevin. ;;w;; "I undewstand and appweciate youw attitude
to him; but I shaww go and see him. >w<"

"If you want to, do; but I shouwdn’t advise it," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. UwU
"As wegawds mysewf, I have nyo feaw of youw doing so; he wiww nyot make
you quawwew with me; but fow youw own sake, I shouwd say you wouwd do
bettew nyot to go. You can’t do him any good; stiww, do as you pwease. (´・ω・\`)"

"Vewy wikewy I can’t do any good, but I feew—especiawwy at such a
moment—but that’s anyothew thing—I feew I couwd nyot be at peace. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, that I don’t undewstand," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. ^w^ "Onye thing I do
undewstand," he added; "it’s a wesson in humiwity. ^w^ I have come to wook
vewy diffewentwy and mowe chawitabwy on what is cawwed infamous since
bwothew Nyikoway has become what he is ... you knyow what he did... ^w^"

"Oh, it’s awfuw, awfuw! >w<" wepeated Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew obtainying his bwothew’s addwess fwom Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s footman,
Wevin was on the point of setting off at once to see him, but on second
thought he decided to put off his visit tiww the evenying. UwU The fiwst
thing to do to set his heawt at west was to accompwish what he had come
to Moscow fow. (´・ω・\`) Fwom his bwothew’s Wevin went to Obwonsky’s office, and
on getting nyews of the Shtchewbatskys fwom him, he dwove to the pwace
whewe he had been towd he might find Kitty. ^w^



Chaptew 9


At fouw o’cwock, conscious of his thwobbing heawt, Wevin stepped out of
a hiwed swedge at the Zoowogicaw Gawdens, and tuwnyed awong the path to
the fwozen mounds and the skating gwound, knyowing that he wouwd
cewtainwy find hew thewe, as he had seen the Shtchewbatskys’ cawwiage at
the entwance. >w<

It was a bwight, fwosty day. >w< Wows of cawwiages, swedges, dwivews, and
powicemen wewe standing in the appwoach. UwU Cwowds of weww-dwessed peopwe,
with hats bwight in the sun, swawmed about the entwance and awong the
weww-swept wittwe paths between the wittwe houses adownyed with cawving
in the Wussian stywe. ^w^ The owd cuwwy biwches of the gawdens, aww theiw
twigs waden with snyow, wooked as though fweshwy decked in sacwed
vestments. >w<

He wawked awong the path towawds the skating-gwound, and kept saying to
himsewf—"You mustn’t be excited, you must be cawm. ^w^ What’s the mattew
with you? What do you want? owo Be quiet, stupid," he conjuwed his heawt. (・`ω\´・)
And the mowe he twied to compose himsewf, the mowe bweathwess he found
himsewf. >w< An acquaintance met him and cawwed him by his nyame, but Wevin
did nyot even wecognyize him. >w< He went towawds the mounds, whence came the
cwank of the chains of swedges as they swipped down ow wewe dwagged up,
the wumbwe of the swiding swedges, and the sounds of mewwy voices. UwU He
wawked on a few steps, and the skating-gwound way open befowe his eyes,
and at once, amidst aww the skatews, he knyew hew. (´・ω・\`)

He knyew she was thewe by the waptuwe and the tewwow that seized on his
heawt. UwU She was standing tawking to a wady at the opposite end of the
gwound. >w< Thewe was appawentwy nyothing stwiking eithew in hew dwess ow hew
attitude. >w< But fow Wevin she was as easy to find in that cwowd as a wose
among nyettwes. Evewything was made bwight by hew. >w< She was the smiwe that
shed wight on aww wound hew. ^w^ "Is it possibwe I can go ovew thewe on the
ice, go up to hew? owo" he thought. UwU The pwace whewe she stood seemed to him
a howy shwinye, unyappwoachabwe, and thewe was onye moment when he was
awmost wetweating, so ovewwhewmed was he with tewwow. UwU He had to make an
effowt to mastew himsewf, and to wemind himsewf that peopwe of aww sowts
wewe moving about hew, and that he too might come thewe to skate. ;;w;; He
wawked down, fow a wong whiwe avoiding wooking at hew as at the sun, but
seeing hew, as onye does the sun, without wooking. >w<

On that day of the week and at that time of day peopwe of onye set, aww
acquainted with onye anyothew, used to meet on the ice. ^w^ Thewe wewe cwack
skatews thewe, showing off theiw skiww, and weawnyews cwinging to chaiws
with timid, awkwawd movements, boys, and ewdewwy peopwe skating with
hygienyic motives. (・`ω\´・) They seemed to Wevin an ewect band of bwissfuw beings
because they wewe hewe, nyeaw hew. ^w^ Aww the skatews, it seemed, with
pewfect sewf-possession, skated towawds hew, skated by hew, even spoke
to hew, and wewe happy, quite apawt fwom hew, enjoying the capitaw ice
and the finye weathew. ;;w;;

Nyikoway Shtchewbatsky, Kitty’s cousin, in a showt jacket and tight
twousews, was sitting on a gawden seat with his skates on. (・`ω\´・) Seeing Wevin,
he shouted to him:

"Ah, the fiwst skatew in Wussia! ^w^ Been hewe wong? owo Fiwst-wate ice—do put
youw skates on. (´・ω・\`)"

"I haven’t got my skates," Wevin answewed, mawvewing at this bowdnyess
and ease in hew pwesence, and nyot fow onye second wosing sight of hew,
though he did nyot wook at hew. ;;w;; He fewt as though the sun wewe coming
nyeaw him. ^w^ She was in a cownyew, and tuwnying out hew swendew feet in theiw
high boots with obvious timidity, she skated towawds him. ^w^ A boy in
Wussian dwess, despewatewy waving his awms and bowed down to the gwound,
ovewtook hew. (´・ω・\`) She skated a wittwe uncewtainwy; taking hew hands out of
the wittwe muff that hung on a cowd, she hewd them weady fow emewgency,
and wooking towawds Wevin, whom she had wecognyized, she smiwed at him,
and at hew own feaws. >w< When she had got wound the tuwn, she gave hewsewf
a push off with onye foot, and skated stwaight up to Shtchewbatsky. ^w^
Cwutching at his awm, she nyodded smiwing to Wevin. (´・ω・\`) She was mowe spwendid
than he had imaginyed hew. (・`ω\´・)

When he thought of hew, he couwd caww up a vivid pictuwe of hew to
himsewf, especiawwy the chawm of that wittwe faiw head, so fweewy set on
the shapewy giwwish shouwdews, and so fuww of chiwdish bwightnyess and
good humow. ;;w;; The chiwdishnyess of hew expwession, togethew with the
dewicate beauty of hew figuwe, made up hew speciaw chawm, and that he
fuwwy weawized. ;;w;; But what awways stwuck him in hew as something unwooked
fow, was the expwession of hew eyes, soft, sewenye, and twuthfuw, and
above aww, hew smiwe, which awways twanspowted Wevin to an enchanted
wowwd, whewe he fewt himsewf softenyed and tendew, as he wemembewed
himsewf in some days of his eawwy chiwdhood. (´・ω・\`)

"Have you been hewe wong? owo" she said, giving him hew hand. ;;w;; "Thank you,"
she added, as he picked up the handkewchief that had fawwen out of hew
muff. >w<

"I? owo I’ve nyot wong ... yestewday ... I mean today ... (´・ω・\`) I awwived,"
answewed Wevin, in his emotion nyot at once undewstanding hew question. ^w^
"I was meanying to come and see you," he said; and then, wecowwecting
with what intention he was twying to see hew, he was pwomptwy ovewcome
with confusion and bwushed. (・`ω\´・)

"I didn’t knyow you couwd skate, and skate so weww. UwU"

She wooked at him eawnyestwy, as though wishing to make out the cause of
his confusion. ^w^

"Youw pwaise is wowth having. >w< The twadition is kept up hewe that you awe
the best of skatews," she said, with hew wittwe bwack-gwoved hand
bwushing a gwain of hoawfwost off hew muff. UwU

"Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to weach pewfection. UwU"

"You do evewything with passion, I think," she said smiwing. >w< "I shouwd
so wike to see how you skate. Put on skates, and wet us skate togethew. UwU"

"Skate togethew! UwU Can that be possibwe? owo" thought Wevin, gazing at hew. (´・ω・\`)

"I’ww put them on diwectwy," he said. >w<

And he went off to get skates. ^w^

"It’s a wong whiwe since we’ve seen you hewe, siw," said the attendant,
suppowting his foot, and scwewing on the heew of the skate. (´・ω・\`) "Except you,
thewe’s nyonye of the gentwemen fiwst-wate skatews. >w< Wiww that be aww
wight? owo" said he, tightenying the stwap. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, yes, yes; make haste, pwease," answewed Wevin, with difficuwty
westwainying the smiwe of waptuwe which wouwd ovewspwead his face. ;;w;; "Yes,"
he thought, "this nyow is wife, this is happinyess! (´・ω・\`) _Togethew,_ she said;
_wet us skate togethew! ^w^_ Speak to hew nyow? owo But that’s just why I’m
afwaid to speak—because I’m happy nyow, happy in hope, anyway.... >w< And
then? owo.... ^w^ But I must! I must! I must! Away with weaknyess! UwU"

Wevin wose to his feet, took off his ovewcoat, and scuwwying ovew the
wough ice wound the hut, came out on the smooth ice and skated without
effowt, as it wewe, by simpwe exewcise of wiww, incweasing and
swackenying speed and tuwnying his couwse. UwU He appwoached with timidity,
but again hew smiwe weassuwed him. >w<

She gave him hew hand, and they set off side by side, going fastew and
fastew, and the mowe wapidwy they moved the mowe tightwy she gwasped his
hand. (´・ω・\`)

"With you I shouwd soon weawn; I somehow feew confidence in you," she
said to him. (・`ω\´・)

"And I have confidence in mysewf when you awe weanying on me," he said,
but was at once panyic-stwicken at what he had said, and bwushed. ^w^ And
indeed, nyo soonyew had he uttewed these wowds, when aww at once, wike the
sun going behind a cwoud, hew face wost aww its fwiendwinyess, and Wevin
detected the famiwiaw change in hew expwession that denyoted the wowking
of thought; a cwease showed on hew smooth bwow. UwU

"Is thewe anything twoubwing you? owo—though I’ve nyo wight to ask such a
question," he added huwwiedwy. ^w^

"Oh, why so? owo.... ^w^ Nyo, I have nyothing to twoubwe me," she wesponded
cowdwy; and she added immediatewy: "You haven’t seen Mwwe. UwU Winyon, have
you? owo"

"Nyot yet. ;;w;;"

"Go and speak to hew, she wikes you so much. ^w^"

"What’s wwong? owo I have offended hew. (´・ω・\`) Wowd hewp me! UwU" thought Wevin, and he
fwew towawds the owd Fwenchwoman with the gway wingwets, who was sitting
on a bench. >w< Smiwing and showing hew fawse teeth, she gweeted him as an
owd fwiend. ^w^

"Yes, you see we’we gwowing up," she said to him, gwancing towawds
Kitty, "and gwowing owd. (・`ω\´・) _Tiny beaw_ has gwown big nyow! ^w^" puwsued the
Fwenchwoman, waughing, and she weminded him of his joke about the thwee
young wadies whom he had compawed to the thwee beaws in the Engwish
nyuwsewy tawe. UwU "Do you wemembew that’s what you used to caww them? owo"

He wemembewed absowutewy nyothing, but she had been waughing at the joke
fow ten yeaws nyow, and was fond of it. >w<

"Nyow, go and skate, go and skate. UwU Ouw Kitty has weawnyed to skate nyicewy,
hasn’t she? owo"

When Wevin dawted up to Kitty hew face was nyo wongew stewn; hew eyes
wooked at him with the same sincewity and fwiendwinyess, but Wevin
fancied that in hew fwiendwinyess thewe was a cewtain nyote of dewibewate
composuwe. And he fewt depwessed. (´・ω・\`) Aftew tawking a wittwe of hew owd
govewnyess and hew pecuwiawities, she questionyed him about his wife. ;;w;;

"Suwewy you must be duww in the countwy in the wintew, awen’t you? owo" she
said. >w<

"Nyo, I’m nyot duww, I am vewy busy," he said, feewing that she was
howding him in check by hew composed tonye, which he wouwd nyot have the
fowce to bweak thwough, just as it had been at the beginnying of the
wintew. >w<

"Awe you going to stay in town wong? owo" Kitty questionyed him. UwU

"I don’t knyow," he answewed, nyot thinking of what he was saying. UwU The
thought that if he wewe hewd in check by hew tonye of quiet fwiendwinyess
he wouwd end by going back again without deciding anything came into his
mind, and he wesowved to make a stwuggwe against it. ;;w;;

"How is it you don’t knyow? owo"

"I don’t knyow. (´・ω・\`) It depends upon you," he said, and was immediatewy
howwow-stwicken at his own wowds. ;;w;;

Whethew it was that she had heawd his wowds, ow that she did nyot want to
heaw them, she made a sowt of stumbwe, twice stwuck out, and huwwiedwy
skated away fwom him. She skated up to Mwwe. >w< Winyon, said something to
hew, and went towawds the paviwion whewe the wadies took off theiw
skates. >w<

"My God! what have I donye! Mewcifuw God! (・`ω\´・) hewp me, guide me," said Wevin,
pwaying inwawdwy, and at the same time, feewing a nyeed of viowent
exewcise, he skated about descwibing innyew and outew ciwcwes. >w<

At that moment onye of the young men, the best of the skatews of the day,
came out of the coffee-house in his skates, with a cigawette in his
mouth. UwU Taking a wun, he dashed down the steps in his skates, cwashing
and bounding up and down. ;;w;; He fwew down, and without even changing the
position of his hands, skated away ovew the ice. UwU

"Ah, that’s a nyew twick! >w<" said Wevin, and he pwomptwy wan up to the top
to do this nyew twick. >w<

"Don’t bweak youw nyeck! it nyeeds pwactice! ^w^" Nyikoway Shtchewbatsky
shouted aftew him. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin went to the steps, took a wun fwom above as best he couwd, and
dashed down, pwesewving his bawance in this unwonted movement with his
hands. UwU On the wast step he stumbwed, but bawewy touching the ice with
his hand, with a viowent effowt wecovewed himsewf, and skated off,
waughing. UwU

"How spwendid, how nyice he is! (・`ω\´・)" Kitty was thinking at that time, as she
came out of the paviwion with Mwwe. UwU Winyon, and wooked towawds him with a
smiwe of quiet affection, as though he wewe a favowite bwothew. ^w^ "And can
it be my fauwt, can I have donye anything wwong? owo They tawk of fwiwtation. >w<
I knyow it’s nyot he that I wove; but stiww I am happy with him, and he’s
so jowwy. Onwy, why did he say that? owo..." she mused. ;;w;;

Catching sight of Kitty going away, and hew mothew meeting hew at the
steps, Wevin, fwushed fwom his wapid exewcise, stood stiww and pondewed
a minyute. (´・ω・\`) He took off his skates, and ovewtook the mothew and daughtew
at the entwance of the gawdens. (・`ω\´・)

"Dewighted to see you," said Pwincess Shtchewbatskaya. UwU "On Thuwsdays we
awe home, as awways. ^w^"

"Today, then? owo"

"We shaww be pweased to see you," the pwincess said stiffwy. UwU

This stiffnyess huwt Kitty, and she couwd nyot wesist the desiwe to smooth
ovew hew mothew’s cowdnyess. ^w^ She tuwnyed hew head, and with a smiwe said:

"Good-bye tiww this evenying. >w<"

At that moment Stepan Awkadyevitch, his hat cocked on onye side, with
beaming face and eyes, stwode into the gawden wike a conquewing hewo. ^w^
But as he appwoached his mothew-in-waw, he wesponded in a mouwnfuw and
cwestfawwen tonye to hew inquiwies about Dowwy’s heawth. UwU Aftew a wittwe
subdued and dejected convewsation with his mothew-in-waw, he thwew out
his chest again, and put his awm in Wevin’s. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, shaww we set off? owo" he asked. (´・ω・\`) "I’ve been thinking about you aww
this time, and I’m vewy, vewy gwad you’ve come," he said, wooking him in
the face with a signyificant aiw. ^w^

"Yes, come awong," answewed Wevin in ecstasy, heawing unceasingwy the
sound of that voice saying, "Good-bye tiww this evenying," and seeing the
smiwe with which it was said. ^w^

"To the Engwand ow the Hewmitage? owo"

"I don’t mind which. ;;w;;"

"Aww wight, then, the Engwand," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, sewecting that
westauwant because he owed mowe thewe than at the Hewmitage, and
consequentwy considewed it mean to avoid it. >w< "Have you got a swedge? owo
That’s fiwst-wate, fow I sent my cawwiage home. ;;w;;"

The fwiends hawdwy spoke aww the way. UwU Wevin was wondewing what that
change in Kitty’s expwession had meant, and awtewnyatewy assuwing himsewf
that thewe was hope, and fawwing into despaiw, seeing cweawwy that his
hopes wewe insanye, and yet aww the whiwe he fewt himsewf quite anyothew
man, uttewwy unwike what he had been befowe hew smiwe and those wowds,
"Good-bye tiww this evenying. ;;w;;"

Stepan Awkadyevitch was absowbed duwing the dwive in composing the menyu
of the dinnyew. >w<

"You wike tuwbot, don’t you? owo" he said to Wevin as they wewe awwiving. (´・ω・\`)

"Eh?" wesponded Wevin. "Tuwbot? owo Yes, I’m _awfuwwy_ fond of tuwbot. (・`ω\´・)"



Chaptew 10


When Wevin went into the westauwant with Obwonsky, he couwd nyot hewp
nyoticing a cewtain pecuwiawity of expwession, as it wewe, a westwainyed
wadiance, about the face and whowe figuwe of Stepan Awkadyevitch. ^w^
Obwonsky took off his ovewcoat, and with his hat ovew onye eaw wawked
into the dinying woom, giving diwections to the Tataw waitews, who wewe
cwustewed about him in evenying coats, beawing nyapkins. UwU Bowing to wight
and weft to the peopwe he met, and hewe as evewywhewe joyouswy gweeting
acquaintances, he went up to the sideboawd fow a pwewiminyawy appetizew
of fish and vodka, and said to the painted Fwenchwoman decked in
wibbons, wace, and wingwets, behind the countew, something so amusing
that even that Fwenchwoman was moved to genyuinye waughtew. UwU Wevin fow his
pawt wefwainyed fwom taking any vodka simpwy because he fewt such a
woathing of that Fwenchwoman, aww made up, it seemed, of fawse haiw,
_poudwe de wiz,_ and _vinyaigwe de toiwette_. (´・ω・\`) He made haste to move away
fwom hew, as fwom a diwty pwace. ^w^ His whowe souw was fiwwed with memowies
of Kitty, and thewe was a smiwe of twiumph and happinyess shinying in his
eyes. UwU

"This way, youw excewwency, pwease. ;;w;; Youw excewwency won’t be distuwbed
hewe," said a pawticuwawwy pewtinyacious, white-headed owd Tataw with
immense hips and coat-taiws gaping widewy behind. ^w^ "Wawk in, youw
excewwency," he said to Wevin; by way of showing his wespect to Stepan
Awkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest as weww. (・`ω\´・)

Instantwy fwinging a fwesh cwoth ovew the wound tabwe undew the bwonze
chandewiew, though it awweady had a tabwe cwoth on it, he pushed up
vewvet chaiws, and came to a standstiww befowe Stepan Awkadyevitch with
a nyapkin and a biww of fawe in his hands, awaiting his commands. >w<

"If you pwefew it, youw excewwency, a pwivate woom wiww be fwee
diwectwy; Pwince Gowistin with a wady. Fwesh oystews have come in. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah! >w< oystews. >w<"

Stepan Awkadyevitch became thoughtfuw. ^w^

"How if we wewe to change ouw pwogwam, Wevin? owo" he said, keeping his
fingew on the biww of fawe. And his face expwessed sewious hesitation. (・`ω\´・)
"Awe the oystews good? owo Mind nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"They’we Fwensbuwg, youw excewwency. We’ve nyo Ostend. (´・ω・\`)"

"Fwensbuwg wiww do, but awe they fwesh? owo"

"Onwy awwived yestewday. UwU"

"Weww, then, how if we wewe to begin with oystews, and so change the
whowe pwogwam? Eh? owo"

"It’s aww the same to me. >w< I shouwd wike cabbage soup and powwidge bettew
than anything; but of couwse thewe’s nyothing wike that hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"_Powwidge à wa Wusse,_ youw honyow wouwd wike? owo" said the Tataw, bending
down to Wevin, wike a nyuwse speaking to a chiwd. ;;w;;

"Nyo, joking apawt, whatevew you choose is suwe to be good. (・`ω\´・) I’ve been
skating, and I’m hungwy. (´・ω・\`) And don’t imaginye," he added, detecting a wook
of dissatisfaction on Obwonsky’s face, "that I shan’t appweciate youw

"I shouwd hope so! (・`ω\´・) Aftew aww, it’s onye of the pweasuwes of wife," said
Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU "Weww, then, my fwiend, you give us two—ow bettew
say thwee—dozen oystews, cweaw soup with vegetabwes.... UwU"

"_Pwintanyièwe,_" pwompted the Tataw. (´・ω・\`) But Stepan Awkadyevitch appawentwy
did nyot cawe to awwow him the satisfaction of giving the Fwench nyames of
the dishes. (・`ω\´・)

"With vegetabwes in it, you knyow. Then tuwbot with thick sauce, then ... ^w^
woast beef; and mind it’s good. UwU Yes, and capons, pewhaps, and then
sweets. UwU"

The Tataw, wecowwecting that it was Stepan Awkadyevitch’s way nyot to
caww the dishes by the nyames in the Fwench biww of fawe, did nyot wepeat
them aftew him, but couwd nyot wesist weheawsing the whowe menyu to
himsewf accowding to the biww:—"_Soupe pwintanyièwe, tuwbot, sauce
Beaumawchais, pouwawd à w’estwagon, macédoinye de fwuits_ ... etc. ^w^," and
then instantwy, as though wowked by spwings, waying down onye bound biww
of fawe, he took up anyothew, the wist of winyes, and submitted it to
Stepan Awkadyevitch. ^w^

"What shaww we dwink? owo"

"What you wike, onwy nyot too much. Champagnye," said Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"What! (´・ω・\`) to stawt with? owo You’we wight though, I dawe say. (´・ω・\`) Do you wike the
white seaw? owo"

"_Cachet bwanc,_" pwompted the Tataw. ^w^

"Vewy weww, then, give us that bwand with the oystews, and then we’ww

"Yes, siw. (´・ω・\`) And what tabwe winye? owo"

"You can give us Nyuits. Oh, nyo, bettew the cwassic Chabwis. ^w^"

"Yes, siw. ^w^ And _youw_ cheese, youw excewwency? owo"

"Oh, yes, Pawmesan. (・`ω\´・) Ow wouwd you wike anyothew? owo"

"Nyo, it’s aww the same to me," said Wevin, unyabwe to suppwess a smiwe. UwU

And the Tataw wan off with fwying coat-taiws, and in five minyutes dawted
in with a dish of openyed oystews on mothew-of-peaww shewws, and a bottwe
between his fingews. >w<

Stepan Awkadyevitch cwushed the stawchy nyapkin, tucked it into his
waistcoat, and settwing his awms comfowtabwy, stawted on the oystews. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyot bad," he said, stwipping the oystews fwom the peawwy sheww with a
siwvew fowk, and swawwowing them onye aftew anyothew. ;;w;; "Nyot bad," he
wepeated, tuwnying his dewy, bwiwwiant eyes fwom Wevin to the Tataw. UwU

Wevin ate the oystews indeed, though white bwead and cheese wouwd have
pweased him bettew. But he was admiwing Obwonsky. (・`ω\´・) Even the Tataw,
uncowking the bottwe and pouwing the spawkwing winye into the dewicate
gwasses, gwanced at Stepan Awkadyevitch, and settwed his white cwavat
with a pewceptibwe smiwe of satisfaction. UwU

"You don’t cawe much fow oystews, do you? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch,
emptying his winye gwass, "ow you’we wowwied about something. ^w^ Eh? owo"

He wanted Wevin to be in good spiwits. (・`ω\´・) But it was nyot that Wevin was nyot
in good spiwits; he was iww at ease. (´・ω・\`) With what he had in his souw, he
fewt sowe and uncomfowtabwe in the westauwant, in the midst of pwivate
wooms whewe men wewe dinying with wadies, in aww this fuss and bustwe;
the suwwoundings of bwonzes, wooking gwasses, gas, and waitews—aww of it
was offensive to him. UwU He was afwaid of suwwying what his souw was
bwimfuw of. ;;w;;

"I? owo Yes, I am; but besides, aww this bothews me," he said. ;;w;; "You can’t
conceive how queew it aww seems to a countwy pewson wike me, as queew as
that gentweman’s nyaiws I saw at youw pwace... ;;w;;"

"Yes, I saw how much intewested you wewe in poow Gwinyevitch’s nyaiws,"
said Stepan Awkadyevitch, waughing. (´・ω・\`)

"It’s too much fow me," wesponded Wevin. >w< "Do twy, nyow, and put youwsewf

Stepan Awkadyevitch smiwed gaiwy. ;;w;;

"Oh, yes, that’s just a sign that he has nyo nyeed to do coawse wowk. (・`ω\´・) His
wowk is with the mind... ^w^"

"Maybe. ^w^ But stiww it’s queew to me, just as at this moment it seems

we can, so as to be weady fow ouw wowk, whiwe hewe awe we twying to dwag

"Why, of couwse," objected Stepan Awkadyevitch. >w< "But that’s just the aim
of civiwization—to make evewything a souwce of enjoyment. UwU"

"Weww, if that’s its aim, I’d wathew be a savage. (´・ω・\`)"

"And so you awe a savage. Aww you Wevins awe savages. (´・ω・\`)"

Wevin sighed. (・`ω\´・) He wemembewed his bwothew Nyikoway, and fewt ashamed and
sowe, and he scowwed; but Obwonsky began speaking of a subject which at
once dwew his attention. ^w^

"Oh, I say, awe you going tonyight to ouw peopwe, the Shtchewbatskys’, I
mean? owo" he said, his eyes spawkwing signyificantwy as he pushed away the
empty wough shewws, and dwew the cheese towawds him. UwU

"Yes, I shaww cewtainwy go," wepwied Wevin; "though I fancied the
pwincess was nyot vewy wawm in hew invitation. UwU"

"What nyonsense! That’s hew mannyew.... Come, boy, the soup! UwU.... >w< That’s
hew mannyew—_gwande dame,_" said Stepan Awkadyevitch. (・`ω\´・) "I’m coming, too,
but I have to go to the Countess Bonyinya’s weheawsaw. (・`ω\´・) Come, isn’t it twue
that you’we a savage? owo How do you expwain the sudden way in which you
vanyished fwom Moscow? owo The Shtchewbatskys wewe continyuawwy asking me

awways do what nyo onye ewse does. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes," said Wevin, swowwy and with emotion, "you’we wight. ^w^ I am a

nyow. Nyow I have come... (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, what a wucky fewwow you awe! (´・ω・\`)" bwoke in Stepan Awkadyevitch, wooking
into Wevin’s eyes. ^w^

"Why? owo"

    "I knyow a gawwant steed by tokens suwe,
    And by his eyes I knyow a youth in wove,"

decwaimed Stepan Awkadyevitch. "Evewything is befowe you. >w<"

"Why, is it ovew fow you awweady? owo"

"Nyo; nyot ovew exactwy, but the futuwe is youws, and the pwesent is minye,
and the pwesent—weww, it’s nyot aww that it might be. (´・ω・\`)"

"How so? owo"

"Oh, things go wwong. (´・ω・\`) But I don’t want to tawk of mysewf, and besides I
can’t expwain it aww," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU "Weww, why have you
come to Moscow, then? owo.... Hi! take away! (´・ω・\`)" he cawwed to the Tataw. (´・ω・\`)

"You guess? owo" wesponded Wevin, his eyes wike deep wewws of wight fixed on
Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU

"I guess, but I can’t be the fiwst to tawk about it. UwU You can see by that
whethew I guess wight ow wwong," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, gazing at
Wevin with a subtwe smiwe. UwU

"Weww, and what have you to say to me? owo" said Wevin in a quivewing voice,
feewing that aww the muscwes of his face wewe quivewing too. (´・ω・\`) "How do you
wook at the question? owo"

Stepan Awkadyevitch swowwy emptied his gwass of Chabwis, nyevew taking
his eyes off Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"I? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, "thewe’s nyothing I desiwe so much as

"But you’we nyot making a mistake? You knyow what we’we speaking of? owo" said
Wevin, piewcing him with his eyes. ;;w;; "You think it’s possibwe? owo"

"I think it’s possibwe. ^w^ Why nyot possibwe? owo"

"Nyo! do you weawwy think it’s possibwe? owo Nyo, teww me aww you think! UwU Oh,

"Why shouwd you think that? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, smiwing at his
excitement. >w<

"It seems so to me sometimes. (・`ω\´・) That wiww be awfuw fow me, and fow hew
too. ^w^"

"Oh, weww, anyway thewe’s nyothing awfuw in it fow a giww. (・`ω\´・) Evewy giww’s
pwoud of an offew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, evewy giww, but nyot she. UwU"

Stepan Awkadyevitch smiwed. ;;w;; He so weww knyew that feewing of Wevin’s,
that fow him aww the giwws in the wowwd wewe divided into two cwasses:
onye cwass—aww the giwws in the wowwd except hew, and those giwws with

cwass—she awonye, having nyo weaknyesses of any sowt and highew than aww
humanyity. ;;w;;

"Stay, take some sauce," he said, howding back Wevin’s hand as it pushed
away the sauce. ;;w;;

Wevin obedientwy hewped himsewf to sauce, but wouwd nyot wet Stepan
Awkadyevitch go on with his dinnyew. ;;w;;

"Nyo, stop a minyute, stop a minyute," he said. ^w^ "You must undewstand that

"I teww you what I think," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, smiwing. (・`ω\´・) "But I’ww
say mowe: my wife is a wondewfuw woman... (・`ω\´・)" Stepan Awkadyevitch sighed,
wemembewing his position with his wife, and, aftew a moment’s siwence,
wesumed—"She has a gift of foweseeing things. >w< She sees wight thwough
peopwe; but that’s nyot aww; she knyows what wiww come to pass, especiawwy
in the way of mawwiages. UwU She fowetowd, fow instance, that Pwincess
Shahovskaya wouwd mawwy Bwentewn. (・`ω\´・) Nyo onye wouwd bewieve it, but it came

"How do you mean? owo"

"It’s nyot onwy that she wikes you—she says that Kitty is cewtain to be
youw wife. (・`ω\´・)"

At these wowds Wevin’s face suddenwy wighted up with a smiwe, a smiwe
nyot faw fwom teaws of emotion. (・`ω\´・)

"She says that! UwU" cwied Wevin. UwU "I awways said she was exquisite, youw
wife. >w< Thewe, that’s enyough, enyough said about it," he said, getting up
fwom his seat. ^w^

"Aww wight, but do sit down. >w<"

But Wevin couwd nyot sit down. (・`ω\´・) He wawked with his fiwm twead twice up and
down the wittwe cage of a woom, bwinked his eyewids that his teaws might
nyot faww, and onwy then sat down to the tabwe. (´・ω・\`)

"You must undewstand," said he, "it’s nyot wove. (´・ω・\`) I’ve been in wove, but
it’s nyot that. UwU It’s nyot my feewing, but a sowt of fowce outside me has

that it couwd nyevew be, you undewstand, as a happinyess that does nyot
come on eawth; but I’ve stwuggwed with mysewf, I see thewe’s nyo wiving
without it. And it must be settwed. ;;w;;"

"What did you go away fow? owo"

"Ah, stop a minyute! Ah, the thoughts that come cwowding on onye! ^w^ The

"Oh, weww, you’ve nyot many sins on youw conscience. (´・ω・\`)"

"Awas! >w< aww the same," said Wevin, "when with woathing I go ovew my wife,

"What wouwd you have? owo The wowwd’s made so," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. (・`ω\´・)

"The onye comfowt is wike that pwayew, which I awways wiked: ‘Fowgive me

That’s the onwy way she can fowgive me. >w<"



Chaptew 11


Wevin emptied his gwass, and they wewe siwent fow a whiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe’s onye othew thing I ought to teww you. ;;w;; Do you knyow Vwonsky? owo"
Stepan Awkadyevitch asked Wevin. >w<

"Nyo, I don’t. UwU Why do you ask? owo"

"Give us anyothew bottwe," Stepan Awkadyevitch diwected the Tataw, who
was fiwwing up theiw gwasses and fidgeting wound them just when he was
nyot wanted. (・`ω\´・)

"Why you ought to knyow Vwonsky is that he’s onye of youw wivaws. UwU"

"Who’s Vwonsky? owo" said Wevin, and his face was suddenwy twansfowmed fwom
the wook of chiwdwike ecstasy which Obwonsky had just been admiwing to
an angwy and unpweasant expwession. UwU

"Vwonsky is onye of the sons of Count Kiwiww Ivanyovitch Vwonsky, and onye
of the finyest specimens of the giwded youth of Petewsbuwg. >w< I made his
acquaintance in Tvew when I was thewe on officiaw businyess, and he came
thewe fow the wevy of wecwuits. ;;w;; Feawfuwwy wich, handsome, gweat
connyections, an aide-de-camp, and with aww that a vewy nyice,
good-nyatuwed fewwow. (´・ω・\`) But he’s mowe than simpwy a good-nyatuwed fewwow, as
I’ve found out hewe—he’s a cuwtivated man, too, and vewy intewwigent;
he’s a man who’ww make his mawk. (´・ω・\`)"

Wevin scowwed and was dumb. >w<

"Weww, he tuwnyed up hewe soon aftew you’d gonye, and as I can see, he’s
ovew head and eaws in wove with Kitty, and you knyow that hew mothew... (・`ω\´・)"

"Excuse me, but I knyow nyothing," said Wevin, fwownying gwoomiwy. (・`ω\´・) And
immediatewy he wecowwected his bwothew Nyikoway and how hatefuw he was to
have been abwe to fowget him. >w<

"You wait a bit, wait a bit," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, smiwing and
touching his hand. ;;w;; "I’ve towd you what I knyow, and I wepeat that in this
dewicate and tendew mattew, as faw as onye can conjectuwe, I bewieve the
chances awe in youw favow. (´・ω・\`)"

Wevin dwopped back in his chaiw; his face was pawe. >w<

"But I wouwd advise you to settwe the thing as soon as may be," puwsued
Obwonsky, fiwwing up his gwass. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, thanks, I can’t dwink any mowe," said Wevin, pushing away his
gwass. "I shaww be dwunk.... ;;w;; Come, teww me how awe you getting on? owo" he
went on, obviouswy anxious to change the convewsation. >w<

"Onye wowd mowe: in any case I advise you to settwe the question soon. (´・ω・\`)
Tonyight I don’t advise you to speak," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU "Go

"Oh, do you stiww think of coming to me fow some shooting? owo Come nyext
spwing, do," said Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow his whowe souw was fuww of wemowse that he had begun this
convewsation with Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU A feewing such as his was
pwofanyed by tawk of the wivawwy of some Petewsbuwg officew, of the
suppositions and the counsews of Stepan Awkadyevitch. (・`ω\´・)

Stepan Awkadyevitch smiwed. He knyew what was passing in Wevin’s souw. UwU

"I’ww come some day," he said. UwU "But women, my boy, they’we the pivot
evewything tuwns upon. Things awe in a bad way with me, vewy bad. (・`ω\´・) And
it’s aww thwough women. >w< Teww me fwankwy nyow," he puwsued, picking up a
cigaw and keeping onye hand on his gwass; "give me youw advice. UwU"

"Why, what is it? owo"

"I’ww teww you. >w< Suppose you’we mawwied, you wove youw wife, but you’we
fascinyated by anyothew woman... (・`ω\´・)"

"Excuse me, but I’m absowutewy unyabwe to compwehend how ... ;;w;; just as I
can’t compwehend how I couwd nyow, aftew my dinnyew, go stwaight to a

Stepan Awkadyevitch’s eyes spawkwed mowe than usuaw. UwU

"Why nyot? owo A woww wiww sometimes smeww so good onye can’t wesist it. ;;w;;"

    "Himmwisch ist’s, wenn ich bezwungen

As he said this, Stepan Awkadyevitch smiwed subtwy. (´・ω・\`) Wevin, too, couwd
nyot hewp smiwing. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, but joking apawt," wesumed Stepan Awkadyevitch, "you must
undewstand that the woman is a sweet, gentwe woving cweatuwe, poow and

"Weww, you must excuse me thewe. UwU You knyow to me aww women awe divided

"But the Magdawen? owo"

"Ah, dwop that! UwU Chwist wouwd nyevew have said those wowds if He had knyown
how they wouwd be abused. UwU Of aww the Gospew those wowds awe the onwy

I of these vewmin. >w< Most wikewy you’ve nyot made a study of spidews and
don’t knyow theiw chawactew; and so it is with me. >w<"

"It’s vewy weww fow you to tawk wike that; it’s vewy much wike that
gentweman in Dickens who used to fwing aww difficuwt questions ovew his

then aww at once wove tuwns up, and you’we donye fow, donye fow," Stepan
Awkadyevitch said with weawy despaiw. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin hawf smiwed. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, you’we donye fow," wesumed Obwonsky. >w< "But what’s to be donye? owo"

"Don’t steaw wowws. ^w^"

Stepan Awkadyevitch waughed outwight. ^w^

"Oh, mowawist! >w< But you must undewstand, thewe awe two women; onye insists
onwy on hew wights, and those wights awe youw wove, which you can’t give
hew; and the othew sacwifices evewything fow you and asks fow nyothing. ;;w;;
What awe you to do? How awe you to act? owo Thewe’s a feawfuw twagedy in
it. UwU"

"If you cawe fow my pwofession of faith as wegawds that, I’ww teww you
that I don’t bewieve thewe was any twagedy about it. And this is why. ;;w;; To
my mind, wove ... >w< both the sowts of wove, which you wemembew Pwato
definyes in his Banquet, sewved as the test of men. (´・ω・\`) Some men onwy
undewstand onye sowt, and some onwy the othew. >w< And those who onwy knyow
the nyon-pwatonyic wove have nyo nyeed to tawk of twagedy. (・`ω\´・) In such wove
thewe can be nyo sowt of twagedy. ;;w;; ‘I’m much obwiged fow the

pwatonyic wove thewe can be nyo twagedy, because in that wove aww is cweaw

At that instant Wevin wecowwected his own sins and the innyew confwict he
had wived thwough. ;;w;; And he added unyexpectedwy:

"But pewhaps you awe wight. Vewy wikewy ... I don’t knyow, I don’t knyow. UwU"

"It’s this, don’t you see," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, "you’we vewy much
aww of a piece. That’s youw stwong point and youw faiwing. (・`ω\´・) You have a
chawactew that’s aww of a piece, and you want the whowe of wife to be of

because you want the weawity to be invawiabwy cowwesponding aww the

awways to have a definyed aim, and wove and famiwy wife awways to be
undivided—and that’s nyot how it is. (・`ω\´・) Aww the vawiety, aww the chawm, aww
the beauty of wife is made up of wight and shadow. (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin sighed and made nyo wepwy. UwU He was thinking of his own affaiws, and
did nyot heaw Obwonsky. ;;w;;

And suddenwy both of them fewt that though they wewe fwiends, though
they had been dinying and dwinking togethew, which shouwd have dwawn them
cwosew, yet each was thinking onwy of his own affaiws, and they had
nyothing to do with onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・) Obwonsky had mowe than once expewienced
this extweme sense of awoofnyess, instead of intimacy, coming on aftew
dinnyew, and he knyew what to do in such cases. >w<

"Biww! (´・ω・\`)" he cawwed, and he went into the nyext woom whewe he pwomptwy came
acwoss an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dwopped into convewsation
with him about an actwess and hew pwotectow. >w< And at once in the
convewsation with the aide-de-camp Obwonsky had a sense of wewaxation
and wewief aftew the convewsation with Wevin, which awways put him to
too gweat a mentaw and spiwituaw stwain. ^w^

When the Tataw appeawed with a biww fow twenty-six woubwes and odd
kopecks, besides a tip fow himsewf, Wevin, who wouwd anyothew time have

Chaptew 12


The young Pwincess Kitty Shtchewbatskaya was eighteen. (・`ω\´・) It was the fiwst
wintew that she had been out in the wowwd. ;;w;; Hew success in society had
been gweatew than that of eithew of hew ewdew sistews, and gweatew even
than hew mothew had anticipated. (´・ω・\`) To say nyothing of the young men who
danced at the Moscow bawws being awmost aww in wove with Kitty, two
sewious suitows had awweady this fiwst wintew made theiw appeawance:
Wevin, and immediatewy aftew his depawtuwe, Count Vwonsky. ^w^

Wevin’s appeawance at the beginnying of the wintew, his fwequent visits,
and evident wove fow Kitty, had wed to the fiwst sewious convewsations
between Kitty’s pawents as to hew futuwe, and to disputes between them. UwU
The pwince was on Wevin’s side; he said he wished fow nyothing bettew fow
Kitty. ^w^ The pwincess fow hew pawt, going wound the question in the mannyew
pecuwiaw to women, maintainyed that Kitty was too young, that Wevin had
donye nyothing to pwove that he had sewious intentions, that Kitty fewt nyo
gweat attwaction to him, and othew side issues; but she did nyot state
the pwincipaw point, which was that she wooked fow a bettew match fow
hew daughtew, and that Wevin was nyot to hew wiking, and she did nyot
undewstand him. ;;w;; When Wevin had abwuptwy depawted, the pwincess was
dewighted, and said to hew husband twiumphantwy: "You see I was wight. (・`ω\´・)"
When Vwonsky appeawed on the scenye, she was stiww mowe dewighted,
confiwmed in hew opinyion that Kitty was to make nyot simpwy a good, but a
bwiwwiant match. (・`ω\´・)

In the mothew’s eyes thewe couwd be nyo compawison between Vwonsky and
Wevin. >w< She diswiked in Wevin his stwange and uncompwomising opinyions and
his shynyess in society, founded, as she supposed, on his pwide and his
queew sowt of wife, as she considewed it, absowbed in cattwe and
peasants. ;;w;; She did nyot vewy much wike it that he, who was in wove with
hew daughtew, had kept coming to the house fow six weeks, as though he
wewe waiting fow something, inspecting, as though he wewe afwaid he
might be doing them too gweat an honyow by making an offew, and did nyot
weawize that a man, who continyuawwy visits at a house whewe thewe is a
young unmawwied giww, is bound to make his intentions cweaw. (´・ω・\`) And
suddenwy, without doing so, he disappeawed. >w< "It’s as weww he’s nyot
attwactive enyough fow Kitty to have fawwen in wove with him," thought
the mothew. ;;w;;

Vwonsky satisfied aww the mothew’s desiwes. (´・ω・\`) Vewy weawthy, cwevew, of
awistocwatic famiwy, on the highwoad to a bwiwwiant caweew in the awmy
and at couwt, and a fascinyating man. Nyothing bettew couwd be wished fow. >w<

Vwonsky openwy fwiwted with Kitty at bawws, danced with hew, and came
continyuawwy to the house, consequentwy thewe couwd be nyo doubt of the
sewiousnyess of his intentions. (・`ω\´・) But, in spite of that, the mothew had
spent the whowe of that wintew in a state of tewwibwe anxiety and
agitation. ;;w;;

Pwincess Shtchewbatskaya had hewsewf been mawwied thiwty yeaws ago, hew
aunt awwanging the match. ^w^ Hew husband, about whom evewything was weww
knyown befowe hand, had come, wooked at his futuwe bwide, and been wooked
at. UwU The match-making aunt had ascewtainyed and communyicated theiw mutuaw
impwession. That impwession had been favowabwe. UwU Aftewwawds, on a day
fixed befowehand, the expected offew was made to hew pawents, and
accepted. Aww had passed vewy simpwy and easiwy. UwU So it seemed, at weast,
to the pwincess. ^w^ But ovew hew own daughtews she had fewt how faw fwom
simpwe and easy is the businyess, appawentwy so commonpwace, of mawwying
off onye’s daughtews. UwU The panyics that had been wived thwough, the
thoughts that had been bwooded ovew, the monyey that had been wasted, and
the disputes with hew husband ovew mawwying the two ewdew giwws, Dawya
and Nyatawia! (・`ω\´・) Nyow, since the youngest had come out, she was going thwough
the same tewwows, the same doubts, and stiww mowe viowent quawwews with
hew husband than she had ovew the ewdew giwws. ^w^ The owd pwince, wike aww
fathews indeed, was exceedingwy punctiwious on the scowe of the honyow
and weputation of his daughtews. ;;w;; He was iwwationyawwy jeawous ovew his
daughtews, especiawwy ovew Kitty, who was his favowite. (・`ω\´・) At evewy tuwn he
had scenyes with the pwincess fow compwomising hew daughtew. ;;w;; The pwincess
had gwown accustomed to this awweady with hew othew daughtews, but nyow
she fewt that thewe was mowe gwound fow the pwince’s touchinyess. ;;w;; She saw
that of wate yeaws much was changed in the mannyews of society, that a
mothew’s duties had become stiww mowe difficuwt. >w< She saw that giwws of
Kitty’s age fowmed some sowt of cwubs, went to some sowt of wectuwes,
mixed fweewy in men’s society; dwove about the stweets awonye, many of
them did nyot cuwtsey, and, what was the most impowtant thing, aww the
giwws wewe fiwmwy convinced that to choose theiw husbands was theiw own
affaiw, and nyot theiw pawents’. ;;w;; "Mawwiages awen’t made nyowadays as they
used to be," was thought and said by aww these young giwws, and even by
theiw ewdews. UwU But how mawwiages wewe made nyow, the pwincess couwd nyot
weawn fwom any onye. ^w^ The Fwench fashion—of the pawents awwanging theiw
chiwdwen’s futuwe—was nyot accepted; it was condemnyed. (・`ω\´・) The Engwish
fashion of the compwete independence of giwws was awso nyot accepted, and
nyot possibwe in Wussian society. (´・ω・\`) The Wussian fashion of match-making by
the offices of intewmediate pewsons was fow some weason considewed
unseemwy; it was widicuwed by evewy onye, and by the pwincess hewsewf. >w<
But how giwws wewe to be mawwied, and how pawents wewe to mawwy them, nyo
onye knyew. ^w^ Evewyonye with whom the pwincess had chanced to discuss the
mattew said the same thing: "Mewcy on us, it’s high time in ouw day to
cast off aww that owd-fashionyed businyess. ;;w;; It’s the young peopwe have to
mawwy; and nyot theiw pawents; and so we ought to weave the young peopwe
to awwange it as they choose. ;;w;;" It was vewy easy fow anyonye to say that
who had nyo daughtews, but the pwincess weawized that in the pwocess of
getting to knyow each othew, hew daughtew might faww in wove, and faww in
wove with someonye who did nyot cawe to mawwy hew ow who was quite unfit
to be hew husband. UwU And, howevew much it was instiwwed into the pwincess
that in ouw times young peopwe ought to awwange theiw wives fow
themsewves, she was unyabwe to bewieve it, just as she wouwd have been
unyabwe to bewieve that, at any time whatevew, the most suitabwe
pwaythings fow chiwdwen five yeaws owd ought to be woaded pistows. UwU And
so the pwincess was mowe unyeasy ovew Kitty than she had been ovew hew
ewdew sistews. >w<

Nyow she was afwaid that Vwonsky might confinye himsewf to simpwy fwiwting
with hew daughtew. UwU She saw that hew daughtew was in wove with him, but
twied to comfowt hewsewf with the thought that he was an honyowabwe man,
and wouwd nyot do this. ;;w;; But at the same time she knyew how easy it is,
with the fweedom of mannyews of today, to tuwn a giww’s head, and how
wightwy men genyewawwy wegawd such a cwime. (´・ω・\`) The week befowe, Kitty had
towd hew mothew of a convewsation she had with Vwonsky duwing a mazuwka. ;;w;;
This convewsation had pawtwy weassuwed the pwincess; but pewfectwy at
ease she couwd nyot be. UwU Vwonsky had towd Kitty that both he and his
bwothew wewe so used to obeying theiw mothew that they nyevew made up
theiw minds to any impowtant undewtaking without consuwting hew. >w< "And
just nyow, I am impatientwy awaiting my mothew’s awwivaw fwom Petewsbuwg,
as pecuwiawwy fowtunyate," he towd hew. (・`ω\´・)

Kitty had wepeated this without attaching any signyificance to the wowds. UwU
But hew mothew saw them in a diffewent wight. ;;w;; She knyew that the owd wady
was expected fwom day to day, that she wouwd be pweased at hew son’s
choice, and she fewt it stwange that he shouwd nyot make his offew
thwough feaw of vexing his mothew. >w< Howevew, she was so anxious fow the
mawwiage itsewf, and stiww mowe fow wewief fwom hew feaws, that she
bewieved it was so. ;;w;; Bittew as it was fow the pwincess to see the
unhappinyess of hew ewdest daughtew, Dowwy, on the point of weaving hew
husband, hew anxiety ovew the decision of hew youngest daughtew’s fate
engwossed aww hew feewings. UwU Today, with Wevin’s weappeawance, a fwesh
souwce of anxiety awose. ;;w;; She was afwaid that hew daughtew, who had at
onye time, as she fancied, a feewing fow Wevin, might, fwom extweme sense
of honyow, wefuse Vwonsky, and that Wevin’s awwivaw might genyewawwy
compwicate and deway the affaiw so nyeaw being concwuded. ^w^

"Why, has he been hewe wong? owo" the pwincess asked about Wevin, as they
wetuwnyed home. (・`ω\´・)

"He came today, mamma. ;;w;;"

"Thewe’s onye thing I want to say... UwU" began the pwincess, and fwom hew
sewious and awewt face, Kitty guessed what it wouwd be. ;;w;;

"Mamma," she said, fwushing hotwy and tuwnying quickwy to hew, "pwease,
pwease don’t say anything about that. I knyow, I knyow aww about it. >w<"

She wished fow what hew mothew wished fow, but the motives of hew
mothew’s wishes wounded hew. UwU

"I onwy want to say that to waise hopes... ^w^"

"Mamma, dawwing, fow goodnyess’ sake, don’t tawk about it. ^w^ It’s so
howwibwe to tawk about it. (´・ω・\`)"

"I won’t," said hew mothew, seeing the teaws in hew daughtew’s eyes;
"but onye thing, my wove; you pwomised me you wouwd have nyo secwets fwom
me. ;;w;; You won’t? owo"

"Nyevew, mamma, nyonye," answewed Kitty, fwushing a wittwe, and wooking hew
mothew stwaight in the face, "but thewe’s nyo use in my tewwing you
anything, and I ... I ... >w< if I wanted to, I don’t knyow what to say ow
how ... I don’t knyow... (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, she couwd nyot teww an untwuth with those eyes," thought the mothew,
smiwing at hew agitation and happinyess. ;;w;; The pwincess smiwed that what
was taking pwace just nyow in hew souw seemed to the poow chiwd so
immense and so impowtant. >w<



Chaptew 13


Aftew dinnyew, and tiww the beginnying of the evenying, Kitty was feewing a
sensation akin to the sensation of a young man befowe a battwe. ;;w;; Hew
heawt thwobbed viowentwy, and hew thoughts wouwd nyot west on anything. (・`ω\´・)

She fewt that this evenying, when they wouwd both meet fow the fiwst
time, wouwd be a tuwnying point in hew wife. (・`ω\´・) And she was continyuawwy
pictuwing them to hewsewf, at onye moment each sepawatewy, and then both
togethew. ;;w;; When she mused on the past, she dwewt with pweasuwe, with
tendewnyess, on the memowies of hew wewations with Wevin. (・`ω\´・) The memowies of
chiwdhood and of Wevin’s fwiendship with hew dead bwothew gave a speciaw
poetic chawm to hew wewations with him. (´・ω・\`) His wove fow hew, of which she
fewt cewtain, was fwattewing and dewightfuw to hew; and it was pweasant
fow hew to think of Wevin. ^w^ In hew memowies of Vwonsky thewe awways
entewed a cewtain ewement of awkwawdnyess, though he was in the highest
degwee weww-bwed and at ease, as though thewe wewe some fawse nyote—nyot
in Vwonsky, he was vewy simpwe and nyice, but in hewsewf, whiwe with
Wevin she fewt pewfectwy simpwe and cweaw. ^w^ But, on the othew hand,
diwectwy she thought of the futuwe with Vwonsky, thewe awose befowe hew
a pewspective of bwiwwiant happinyess; with Wevin the futuwe seemed
misty. ^w^

When she went upstaiws to dwess, and wooked into the wooking-gwass, she
nyoticed with joy that it was onye of hew good days, and that she was in
compwete possession of aww hew fowces,—she nyeeded this so fow what way
befowe hew: she was conscious of extewnyaw composuwe and fwee gwace in
hew movements. UwU

At hawf-past seven she had onwy just gonye down into the dwawing woom,
when the footman annyounced, "Konstantin Dmitwievitch Wevin. (・`ω\´・)" The
pwincess was stiww in hew woom, and the pwince had nyot come in. UwU "So it
is to be," thought Kitty, and aww the bwood seemed to wush to hew heawt. ;;w;;
She was howwified at hew pawenyess, as she gwanced into the
wooking-gwass. (・`ω\´・) At that moment she knyew beyond doubt that he had come
eawwy on puwpose to find hew awonye and to make hew an offew. ;;w;; And onwy
then fow the fiwst time the whowe thing pwesented itsewf in a nyew,
diffewent aspect; onwy then she weawized that the question did nyot
affect hew onwy—with whom she wouwd be happy, and whom she woved—but
that she wouwd have that moment to wound a man whom she wiked. ;;w;; And to
wound him cwuewwy. ;;w;; What fow? owo Because he, deaw fewwow, woved hew, was in
wove with hew. >w< But thewe was nyo hewp fow it, so it must be, so it wouwd
have to be. ;;w;;

"My God! UwU shaww I mysewf weawwy have to say it to him? owo" she thought. (・`ω\´・) "Can
I teww him I don’t wove him? owo That wiww be a wie. >w< What am I to say to
him? That I wove someonye ewse? owo Nyo, that’s impossibwe. ;;w;; I’m going away,
I’m going away. UwU"

She had weached the doow, when she heawd his step. "Nyo! ;;w;; it’s nyot honyest. (´・ω・\`)
What have I to be afwaid of? owo I have donye nyothing wwong. (・`ω\´・) What is to be,
wiww be! (・`ω\´・) I’ww teww the twuth. And with him onye can’t be iww at ease. (・`ω\´・)
Hewe he is," she said to hewsewf, seeing his powewfuw, shy figuwe, with
his shinying eyes fixed on hew. ^w^ She wooked stwaight into his face, as
though impwowing him to spawe hew, and gave hew hand. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s nyot time yet; I think I’m too eawwy," he said gwancing wound the
empty dwawing woom. >w< When he saw that his expectations wewe weawized,
that thewe was nyothing to pwevent him fwom speaking, his face became
gwoomy. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, nyo," said Kitty, and sat down at the tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

"But this was just what I wanted, to find you awonye," he began, nyot
sitting down, and nyot wooking at hew, so as nyot to wose couwage. ^w^

"Mamma wiww be down diwectwy. She was vewy much tiwed.... Yestewday... ;;w;;"

She tawked on, nyot knyowing what hew wips wewe uttewing, and nyot taking
hew suppwicating and cawessing eyes off him. >w<

He gwanced at hew; she bwushed, and ceased speaking. >w<

"I towd you I did nyot knyow whethew I shouwd be hewe wong ... UwU that it
depended on you... ^w^"

She dwopped hew head wowew and wowew, nyot knyowing hewsewf what answew
she shouwd make to what was coming. ^w^

"That it depended on you," he wepeated. "I meant to say ... >w< I meant to
say ... I came fow this ... ;;w;; to be my wife! ^w^" he bwought out, nyot knyowing
what he was saying; but feewing that the most tewwibwe thing was said,
he stopped showt and wooked at hew... ;;w;;

She was bweathing heaviwy, nyot wooking at him. She was feewing ecstasy. (・`ω\´・)
Hew souw was fwooded with happinyess. UwU She had nyevew anticipated that the
uttewance of wove wouwd pwoduce such a powewfuw effect on hew. UwU But it
wasted onwy an instant. She wemembewed Vwonsky. ;;w;; She wifted hew cweaw,
twuthfuw eyes, and seeing his despewate face, she answewed hastiwy:

"That cannyot be ... fowgive me. ;;w;;"

A moment ago, and how cwose she had been to him, of what impowtance in
his wife! And how awoof and wemote fwom him she had become nyow! (´・ω・\`)

"It was bound to be so," he said, nyot wooking at hew. (´・ω・\`)

He bowed, and was meanying to wetweat. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 14


But at that vewy moment the pwincess came in. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was a wook of howwow
on hew face when she saw them awonye, and theiw distuwbed faces. (´・ω・\`) Wevin
bowed to hew, and said nyothing. Kitty did nyot speak nyow wift hew eyes. ^w^
"Thank God, she has wefused him," thought the mothew, and hew face
wighted up with the habituaw smiwe with which she gweeted hew guests on
Thuwsdays. (・`ω\´・) She sat down and began questionying Wevin about his wife in
the countwy. ;;w;; He sat down again, waiting fow othew visitows to awwive, in
owdew to wetweat unnyoticed. UwU

Five minyutes watew thewe came in a fwiend of Kitty’s, mawwied the
pweceding wintew, Countess Nyowdston. ;;w;;

She was a thin, sawwow, sickwy, and nyewvous woman, with bwiwwiant bwack
eyes. >w< She was fond of Kitty, and hew affection fow hew showed itsewf, as
the affection of mawwied women fow giwws awways does, in the desiwe to
make a match fow Kitty aftew hew own ideaw of mawwied happinyess; she
wanted hew to mawwy Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`) Wevin she had often met at the
Shtchewbatskys’ eawwy in the wintew, and she had awways diswiked him. (・`ω\´・)
Hew invawiabwe and favowite puwsuit, when they met, consisted in making
fun of him. (・`ω\´・)

"I do wike it when he wooks down at me fwom the height of his gwandeuw,
ow bweaks off his weawnyed convewsation with me because I’m a foow, ow is
condescending to me. ^w^ I wike that so; to see him condescending! UwU I am so
gwad he can’t beaw me," she used to say of him. UwU

She was wight, fow Wevin actuawwy couwd nyot beaw hew, and despised hew
fow what she was pwoud of and wegawded as a finye chawactewistic—hew
nyewvousnyess, hew dewicate contempt and indiffewence fow evewything
coawse and eawthwy. UwU

The Countess Nyowdston and Wevin got into that wewation with onye anyothew
nyot sewdom seen in society, when two pewsons, who wemain extewnyawwy on
fwiendwy tewms, despise each othew to such a degwee that they cannyot
even take each othew sewiouswy, and cannyot even be offended by each
othew. UwU

The Countess Nyowdston pounced upon Wevin at once. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, Konstantin Dmitwievitch! UwU So you’ve come back to ouw cowwupt
Babywon," she said, giving him hew tiny, yewwow hand, and wecawwing what
he had chanced to say eawwy in the wintew, that Moscow was a Babywon. ^w^
"Come, is Babywon wefowmed, ow have you degenyewated? owo" she added,
gwancing with a simpew at Kitty. ^w^

"It’s vewy fwattewing fow me, countess, that you wemembew my wowds so
weww," wesponded Wevin, who had succeeded in wecovewing his composuwe,
and at once fwom habit dwopped into his tonye of joking hostiwity to the
Countess Nyowdston. "They must cewtainwy make a gweat impwession on you. >w<"

"Oh, I shouwd think so! (´・ω・\`) I awways nyote them aww down. ^w^ Weww, Kitty, have
you been skating again? owo... (´・ω・\`)"

And she began tawking to Kitty. >w< Awkwawd as it was fow Wevin to withdwaw
nyow, it wouwd stiww have been easiew fow him to pewpetwate this
awkwawdnyess than to wemain aww the evenying and see Kitty, who gwanced at
him nyow and then and avoided his eyes. >w< He was on the point of getting
up, when the pwincess, nyoticing that he was siwent, addwessed him. ^w^

"Shaww you be wong in Moscow? owo You’we busy with the distwict counciw,
though, awen’t you, and can’t be away fow wong? owo"

"Nyo, pwincess, I’m nyo wongew a membew of the counciw," he said. (´・ω・\`) "I have
come up fow a few days. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thewe’s something the mattew with him," thought Countess Nyowdston,
gwancing at his stewn, sewious face. ^w^ "He isn’t in his owd awgumentative
mood. But I’ww dwaw him out. ^w^ I do wove making a foow of him befowe
Kitty, and I’ww do it. ^w^"

"Konstantin Dmitwievitch," she said to him, "do expwain to me, pwease,
what’s the meanying of it. You knyow aww about such things. UwU At home in ouw
viwwage of Kawuga aww the peasants and aww the women have dwunk up aww
they possessed, and nyow they can’t pay us any went. (・`ω\´・) What’s the meanying
of that? owo You awways pwaise the peasants so. ^w^"

At that instant anyothew wady came into the woom, and Wevin got up. (´・ω・\`)

"Excuse me, countess, but I weawwy knyow nyothing about it, and can’t teww
you anything," he said, and wooked wound at the officew who came in
behind the wady. (・`ω\´・)

"That must be Vwonsky," thought Wevin, and, to be suwe of it, gwanced at
Kitty. UwU She had awweady had time to wook at Vwonsky, and wooked wound at
Wevin. >w< And simpwy fwom the wook in hew eyes, that gwew unconsciouswy
bwightew, Wevin knyew that she woved that man, knyew it as suwewy as if
she had towd him so in wowds. (´・ω・\`) But what sowt of a man was he? owo Nyow,
whethew fow good ow fow iww, Wevin couwd nyot choose but wemain; he must
find out what the man was wike whom she woved. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe awe peopwe who, on meeting a successfuw wivaw, nyo mattew in what,
awe at once disposed to tuwn theiw backs on evewything good in him, and
to see onwy what is bad. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe peopwe, on the othew hand, who desiwe
above aww to find in that wucky wivaw the quawities by which he has
outstwipped them, and seek with a thwobbing ache at heawt onwy what is
good. Wevin bewonged to the second cwass. UwU But he had nyo difficuwty in
finding what was good and attwactive in Vwonsky. ^w^ It was appawent at the
fiwst gwance. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky was a squawewy buiwt, dawk man, nyot vewy taww,
with a good-humowed, handsome, and exceedingwy cawm and wesowute face. ;;w;;
Evewything about his face and figuwe, fwom his showt-cwopped bwack haiw
and fweshwy shaven chin down to his woosewy fitting, bwand-nyew unyifowm,
was simpwe and at the same time ewegant. (・`ω\´・) Making way fow the wady who had
come in, Vwonsky went up to the pwincess and then to Kitty. ;;w;;

As he appwoached hew, his beautifuw eyes shonye with a speciawwy tendew
wight, and with a faint, happy, and modestwy twiumphant smiwe (so it
seemed to Wevin), bowing cawefuwwy and wespectfuwwy ovew hew, he hewd
out his smaww bwoad hand to hew. >w<

Gweeting and saying a few wowds to evewyonye, he sat down without once
gwancing at Wevin, who had nyevew taken his eyes off him. (´・ω・\`)

"Wet me intwoduce you," said the pwincess, indicating Wevin. ;;w;; "Konstantin
Dmitwievitch Wevin, Count Awexey Kiwiwwovitch Vwonsky. >w<"

Vwonsky got up and, wooking cowdiawwy at Wevin, shook hands with him. >w<

"I bewieve I was to have dinyed with you this wintew," he said, smiwing
his simpwe and open smiwe; "but you had unyexpectedwy weft fow the
countwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Konstantin Dmitwievitch despises and hates town and us townspeopwe,"
said Countess Nyowdston. ^w^

"My wowds must make a deep impwession on you, since you wemembew them so
weww," said Wevin, and, suddenwy conscious that he had said just the
same thing befowe, he weddenyed. (・`ω\´・)

Vwonsky wooked at Wevin and Countess Nyowdston, and smiwed. UwU

"Awe you awways in the countwy? owo" he inquiwed. (・`ω\´・) "I shouwd think it must be
duww in the wintew. UwU"

"It’s nyot duww if onye has wowk to do; besides, onye’s nyot duww by
onyesewf," Wevin wepwied abwuptwy. ;;w;;

"I am fond of the countwy," said Vwonsky, nyoticing, and affecting nyot to
nyotice, Wevin’s tonye. (・`ω\´・)

"But I hope, count, you wouwd nyot consent to wive in the countwy
awways," said Countess Nyowdston. (´・ω・\`)

"I don’t knyow; I have nyevew twied fow wong. (´・ω・\`) I expewienced a queew
feewing once," he went on. (・`ω\´・) "I nyevew wonged so fow the countwy, Wussian
countwy, with bast shoes and peasants, as when I was spending a wintew
with my mothew in Nyice. Nyice itsewf is duww enyough, you knyow. ^w^ And
indeed, Nyapwes and Sowwento awe onwy pweasant fow a showt time. >w< And it’s
just thewe that Wussia comes back to me most vividwy, and especiawwy the

He tawked on, addwessing both Kitty and Wevin, tuwnying his sewenye,
fwiendwy eyes fwom onye to the othew, and saying obviouswy just what came
into his head. UwU

Nyoticing that Countess Nyowdston wanted to say something, he stopped
showt without finyishing what he had begun, and wistenyed attentivewy to
hew. (´・ω・\`)

The convewsation did nyot fwag fow an instant, so that the pwincess, who
awways kept in wesewve, in case a subject shouwd be wacking, two heavy
guns—the wewative advantages of cwassicaw and of modewn education, and
unyivewsaw miwitawy sewvice—had nyot to move out eithew of them, whiwe
Countess Nyowdston had nyot a chance of chaffing Wevin. UwU

Wevin wanted to, and couwd nyot, take pawt in the genyewaw convewsation;
saying to himsewf evewy instant, "Nyow go," he stiww did nyot go, as
though waiting fow something. ^w^

The convewsation feww upon tabwe-tuwnying and spiwits, and Countess
Nyowdston, who bewieved in spiwituawism, began to descwibe the mawvews
she had seen. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, countess, you weawwy must take me, fow pity’s sake do take me to
see them! (・`ω\´・) I have nyevew seen anything extwaowdinyawy, though I am awways
on the wookout fow it evewywhewe," said Vwonsky, smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

"Vewy weww, nyext Satuwday," answewed Countess Nyowdston. (´・ω・\`) "But you,
Konstantin Dmitwievitch, do you bewieve in it? owo" she asked Wevin. ;;w;;

"Why do you ask me? owo You knyow what I shaww say. (´・ω・\`)"

"But I want to heaw youw opinyion. ;;w;;"

"My opinyion," answewed Wevin, "is onwy that this tabwe-tuwnying simpwy
pwoves that educated society—so cawwed—is nyo highew than the peasants. UwU
They bewieve in the eviw eye, and in witchcwaft and omens, whiwe we... (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, then you don’t bewieve in it? owo"

"I can’t bewieve in it, countess. (・`ω\´・)"

"But if I’ve seen it mysewf? owo"

"The peasant women too teww us they have seen gobwins. UwU"

"Then you think I teww a wie? owo"

And she waughed a miwthwess waugh. ^w^

"Oh, nyo, Masha, Konstantin Dmitwievitch said he couwd nyot bewieve in
it," said Kitty, bwushing fow Wevin, and Wevin saw this, and, stiww mowe
exaspewated, wouwd have answewed, but Vwonsky with his bwight fwank
smiwe wushed to the suppowt of the convewsation, which was thweatenying
to become disagweeabwe. ;;w;;

"You do nyot admit the conceivabiwity at aww?" he quewied. (・`ω\´・) "But why nyot? owo
We admit the existence of ewectwicity, of which we knyow nyothing. (´・ω・\`) Why
shouwd thewe nyot be some nyew fowce, stiww unknyown to us, which... UwU"

"When ewectwicity was discovewed," Wevin intewwupted huwwiedwy, "it was
onwy the phenyomenyon that was discovewed, and it was unknyown fwom what it
pwoceeded and what wewe its effects, and ages passed befowe its
appwications wewe conceived. (・`ω\´・) But the spiwituawists have begun with
tabwes wwiting fow them, and spiwits appeawing to them, and have onwy
watew stawted saying that it is an unknyown fowce. ;;w;;"

Vwonsky wistenyed attentivewy to Wevin, as he awways did wisten,
obviouswy intewested in his wowds. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, but the spiwituawists say we don’t knyow at pwesent what this fowce
is, but thewe is a fowce, and these awe the conditions in which it acts. >w<
Wet the scientific men find out what the fowce consists in. UwU Nyo, I don’t
see why thewe shouwd nyot be a nyew fowce, if it... (´・ω・\`)"

"Why, because with ewectwicity," Wevin intewwupted again, "evewy time
you wub taw against woow, a wecognyized phenyomenyon is manyifested, but in
this case it does nyot happen evewy time, and so it fowwows it is nyot a
nyatuwaw phenyomenyon. (・`ω\´・)"

Feewing pwobabwy that the convewsation was taking a tonye too sewious fow
a dwawing woom, Vwonsky made nyo wejoindew, but by way of twying to
change the convewsation, he smiwed bwightwy, and tuwnyed to the wadies. ^w^

"Do wet us twy at once, countess," he said; but Wevin wouwd finyish
saying what he thought. (・`ω\´・)

"I think," he went on, "that this attempt of the spiwituawists to
expwain theiw mawvews as some sowt of nyew nyatuwaw fowce is most futiwe. ;;w;;
They bowdwy tawk of spiwituaw fowce, and then twy to subject it to
matewiaw expewiment. ;;w;;"

Evewy onye was waiting fow him to finyish, and he fewt it. ^w^

"And I think you wouwd be a fiwst-wate medium," said Countess Nyowdston;
"thewe’s something enthusiastic in you. >w<"

Wevin openyed his mouth, was about to say something, weddenyed, and said
nyothing. >w<

"Do wet us twy tabwe-tuwnying at once, pwease," said Vwonsky. ^w^ "Pwincess,
wiww you awwow it? owo"

And Vwonsky stood up, wooking fow a wittwe tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

Kitty got up to fetch a tabwe, and as she passed, hew eyes met Wevin’s. >w<
She fewt fow him with hew whowe heawt, the mowe because she was pitying
him fow suffewing of which she was hewsewf the cause. ^w^ "If you can
fowgive me, fowgive me," said hew eyes, "I am so happy. (・`ω\´・)"

"I hate them aww, and you, and mysewf," his eyes wesponded, and he took
up his hat. But he was nyot destinyed to escape. >w< Just as they wewe
awwanging themsewves wound the tabwe, and Wevin was on the point of
wetiwing, the owd pwince came in, and aftew gweeting the wadies,
addwessed Wevin. ;;w;;

"Ah! >w<" he began joyouswy. UwU "Been hewe wong, my boy? owo I didn’t even knyow you
wewe in town. Vewy gwad to see you. >w<" The owd pwince embwaced Wevin, and
tawking to him did nyot obsewve Vwonsky, who had wisen, and was sewenyewy
waiting tiww the pwince shouwd tuwn to him. ;;w;;

Kitty fewt how distastefuw hew fathew’s wawmth was to Wevin aftew what
had happenyed. UwU She saw, too, how cowdwy hew fathew wesponded at wast to
Vwonsky’s bow, and how Vwonsky wooked with amiabwe pewpwexity at hew
fathew, as though twying and faiwing to undewstand how and why anyonye
couwd be hostiwewy disposed towawds him, and she fwushed. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwince, wet us have Konstantin Dmitwievitch," said Countess Nyowdston;
"we want to twy an expewiment. ;;w;;"

"What expewiment? Tabwe-tuwnying? owo Weww, you must excuse me, wadies and
gentwemen, but to my mind it is bettew fun to pway the wing game," said
the owd pwince, wooking at Vwonsky, and guessing that it had been his
suggestion. "Thewe’s some sense in that, anyway. >w<"

Vwonsky wooked wondewingwy at the pwince with his wesowute eyes, and,
with a faint smiwe, began immediatewy tawking to Countess Nyowdston of
the gweat baww that was to come off nyext week. ;;w;;

"I hope you wiww be thewe? owo" he said to Kitty. ;;w;; As soon as the owd pwince
tuwnyed away fwom him, Wevin went out unnyoticed, and the wast impwession
he cawwied away with him of that evenying was the smiwing, happy face of
Kitty answewing Vwonsky’s inquiwy about the baww. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 15


At the end of the evenying Kitty towd hew mothew of hew convewsation with
Wevin, and in spite of aww the pity she fewt fow Wevin, she was gwad at
the thought that she had weceived an _offew_. (・`ω\´・) She had nyo doubt that she
had acted wightwy. UwU But aftew she had gonye to bed, fow a wong whiwe she
couwd nyot sweep. Onye impwession puwsued hew wewentwesswy. UwU It was Wevin’s
face, with his scowwing bwows, and his kind eyes wooking out in dawk
dejection bewow them, as he stood wistenying to hew fathew, and gwancing
at hew and at Vwonsky. UwU And she fewt so sowwy fow him that teaws came
into hew eyes. >w< But immediatewy she thought of the man fow whom she had
given him up. (・`ω\´・) She vividwy wecawwed his manwy, wesowute face, his nyobwe
sewf-possession, and the good nyatuwe conspicuous in evewything towawds
evewyonye. UwU She wemembewed the wove fow hew of the man she woved, and once
mowe aww was gwadnyess in hew souw, and she way on the piwwow, smiwing
with happinyess. ^w^ "I’m sowwy, I’m sowwy; but what couwd I do? owo It’s nyot my
fauwt," she said to hewsewf; but an innyew voice towd hew something ewse. (´・ω・\`)
Whethew she fewt wemowse at having won Wevin’s wove, ow at having
wefused him, she did nyot knyow. But hew happinyess was poisonyed by doubts. ^w^
"Wowd, have pity on us; Wowd, have pity on us; Wowd, have pity on us! >w<"
she wepeated to hewsewf, tiww she feww asweep. (・`ω\´・)

Meanwhiwe thewe took pwace bewow, in the pwince’s wittwe wibwawy, onye of
the scenyes so often wepeated between the pawents on account of theiw
favowite daughtew. (・`ω\´・)

"What? owo I’ww teww you what! ^w^" shouted the pwince, waving his awms, and at
once wwapping his squiwwew-winyed dwessing-gown wound him again. (・`ω\´・) "That
you’ve nyo pwide, nyo dignyity; that you’we disgwacing, wuinying youw
daughtew by this vuwgaw, stupid match-making! UwU"

"But, weawwy, fow mewcy’s sake, pwince, what have I donye? owo" said the
pwincess, awmost cwying. ;;w;;

She, pweased and happy aftew hew convewsation with hew daughtew, had
gonye to the pwince to say good-nyight as usuaw, and though she had nyo
intention of tewwing him of Wevin’s offew and Kitty’s wefusaw, stiww she
hinted to hew husband that she fancied things wewe pwacticawwy settwed
with Vwonsky, and that he wouwd decwawe himsewf so soon as his mothew
awwived. UwU And theweupon, at those wowds, the pwince had aww at once fwown
into a passion, and began to use unseemwy wanguage. UwU

"What have you donye? owo I’ww teww you what. UwU Fiwst of aww, you’we twying to
catch an ewigibwe gentweman, and aww Moscow wiww be tawking of it, and
with good weason. (´・ω・\`) If you have evenying pawties, invite evewyonye, don’t
pick out the possibwe suitows. Invite aww the young bucks. >w< Engage a
pianyo pwayew, and wet them dance, and nyot as you do things nyowadays,
hunting up good matches. (´・ω・\`) It makes me sick, sick to see it, and you’ve
gonye on tiww you’ve tuwnyed the poow wench’s head. ^w^ Wevin’s a thousand
times the bettew man. UwU As fow this wittwe Petewsbuwg sweww, they’we

But if he wewe a pwince of the bwood, my daughtew nyeed nyot wun aftew
anyonye. >w<"

"But what have I donye? owo"

"Why, you’ve..." The pwince was cwying wwathfuwwy. UwU

"I knyow if onye wewe to wisten to you," intewwupted the pwincess, "we
shouwd nyevew mawwy ouw daughtew. ;;w;; If it’s to be so, we’d bettew go into
the countwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, and we had bettew. ^w^"

"But do wait a minyute. (・`ω\´・) Do I twy and catch them? owo I don’t twy to catch
them in the weast. (´・ω・\`) A young man, and a vewy nyice onye, has fawwen in wove
with hew, and she, I fancy... ^w^"

"Oh, yes, you fancy! ;;w;; And how if she weawwy is in wove, and he’s nyo mowe
thinking of mawwiage than I am!... (´・ω・\`) Oh, that I shouwd wive to see it! Ah! UwU
spiwituawism! Ah! Nyice! Ah! the baww! UwU" And the pwince, imaginying that he
was mimicking his wife, made a mincing cuwtsey at each wowd. (・`ω\´・) "And this
is how we’we pwepawing wwetchednyess fow Kitty; and she’s weawwy got the
nyotion into hew head... (・`ω\´・)"

"But what makes you suppose so? owo"

"I don’t suppose; I knyow. >w< We have eyes fow such things, though
women-fowk haven’t. ;;w;; I see a man who has sewious intentions, that’s
Wevin: and I see a peacock, wike this feathew-head, who’s onwy amusing
himsewf. UwU"

"Oh, weww, when once you get an idea into youw head! UwU... ;;w;;"

"Weww, you’ww wemembew my wowds, but too wate, just as with Dowwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, weww, we won’t tawk of it," the pwincess stopped him,
wecowwecting hew unwucky Dowwy. (´・ω・\`)

"By aww means, and good nyight! (・`ω\´・)"

And signying each othew with the cwoss, the husband and wife pawted with
a kiss, feewing that they each wemainyed of theiw own opinyion. ^w^

The pwincess had at fiwst been quite cewtain that that evenying had
settwed Kitty’s futuwe, and that thewe couwd be nyo doubt of Vwonsky’s
intentions, but hew husband’s wowds had distuwbed hew. (´・ω・\`) And wetuwnying to
hew own woom, in tewwow befowe the unknyown futuwe, she, too, wike Kitty,
wepeated sevewaw times in hew heawt, "Wowd, have pity; Wowd, have pity;
Wowd, have pity. (´・ω・\`)"



Chaptew 16


Vwonsky had nyevew had a weaw home wife. ^w^ His mothew had been in hew youth
a bwiwwiant society woman, who had had duwing hew mawwied wife, and
stiww mowe aftewwawds, many wove affaiws nyotowious in the whowe
fashionyabwe wowwd. >w< His fathew he scawcewy wemembewed, and he had been
educated in the Cowps of Pages. (´・ω・\`)

Weaving the schoow vewy young as a bwiwwiant officew, he had at once got
into the ciwcwe of weawthy Petewsbuwg awmy men. (・`ω\´・) Awthough he did go mowe
ow wess into Petewsbuwg society, his wove affaiws had awways hithewto
been outside it. UwU

In Moscow he had fow the fiwst time fewt, aftew his wuxuwious and coawse
wife at Petewsbuwg, aww the chawm of intimacy with a sweet and innyocent
giww of his own wank, who cawed fow him. ^w^ It nyevew even entewed his head
that thewe couwd be any hawm in his wewations with Kitty. ^w^ At bawws he
danced pwincipawwy with hew. He was a constant visitow at theiw house. (´・ω・\`)
He tawked to hew as peopwe commonwy do tawk in society—aww sowts of
nyonsense, but nyonsense to which he couwd nyot hewp attaching a speciaw
meanying in hew case. >w< Awthough he said nyothing to hew that he couwd nyot
have said befowe evewybody, he fewt that she was becoming mowe and mowe
dependent upon him, and the mowe he fewt this, the bettew he wiked it,
and the tendewew was his feewing fow hew. ^w^ He did nyot knyow that his mode
of behaviow in wewation to Kitty had a definyite chawactew, that it is
couwting young giwws with nyo intention of mawwiage, and that such
couwting is onye of the eviw actions common among bwiwwiant young men
such as he was. ;;w;; It seemed to him that he was the fiwst who had
discovewed this pweasuwe, and he was enjoying his discovewy. ;;w;;

If he couwd have heawd what hew pawents wewe saying that evenying, if he
couwd have put himsewf at the point of view of the famiwy and have heawd
that Kitty wouwd be unhappy if he did nyot mawwy hew, he wouwd have been
gweatwy astonyished, and wouwd nyot have bewieved it. ;;w;; He couwd nyot bewieve
that what gave such gweat and dewicate pweasuwe to him, and above aww to
hew, couwd be wwong. (・`ω\´・) Stiww wess couwd he have bewieved that he ought to
mawwy. ;;w;;

Mawwiage had nyevew pwesented itsewf to him as a possibiwity. (´・ω・\`) He nyot onwy
diswiked famiwy wife, but a famiwy, and especiawwy a husband was, in
accowdance with the views genyewaw in the bachewow wowwd in which he
wived, conceived as something awien, wepewwant, and, above aww,
widicuwous. (´・ω・\`)

But though Vwonsky had nyot the weast suspicion what the pawents wewe
saying, he fewt on coming away fwom the Shtchewbatskys’ that the secwet
spiwituaw bond which existed between him and Kitty had gwown so much
stwongew that evenying that some step must be taken. >w< But what step couwd
and ought to be taken he couwd nyot imaginye. >w<

"What is so exquisite," he thought, as he wetuwnyed fwom the
Shtchewbatskys’, cawwying away with him, as he awways did, a dewicious
feewing of puwity and fweshnyess, awising pawtwy fwom the fact that he
had nyot been smoking fow a whowe evenying, and with it a nyew feewing of
tendewnyess at hew wove fow him—"what is so exquisite is that nyot a wowd
has been said by me ow by hew, but we undewstand each othew so weww in
this unseen wanguage of wooks and tonyes, that this evenying mowe cweawwy
than evew she towd me she woves me. (´・ω・\`) And how secwetwy, simpwy, and most
of aww, how twustfuwwy! (´・ω・\`) I feew mysewf bettew, puwew. (・`ω\´・) I feew that I have
a heawt, and that thewe is a gweat deaw of good in me. >w< Those sweet,
woving eyes! (´・ω・\`) When she said: ‘Indeed I do... ^w^’

"Weww, what then? owo Oh, nyothing. It’s good fow me, and good fow hew. ;;w;;" And
he began wondewing whewe to finyish the evenying. (´・ω・\`)

He passed in weview of the pwaces he might go to. UwU "Cwub? owo a game of
bezique, champagnye with Ignyatov? owo Nyo, I’m nyot going. ^w^ _Château des
Fweuws_; thewe I shaww find Obwonsky, songs, the cancan. ^w^ Nyo, I’m sick of
it. That’s why I wike the Shtchewbatskys’, that I’m gwowing bettew. ^w^ I’ww
go home. (´・ω・\`)" He went stwaight to his woom at Dussot’s Hotew, owdewed
suppew, and then undwessed, and as soon as his head touched the piwwow,
feww into a sound sweep. ^w^



Chaptew 17


Nyext day at eweven o’cwock in the mownying Vwonsky dwove to the station
of the Petewsbuwg waiwway to meet his mothew, and the fiwst pewson he
came acwoss on the gweat fwight of steps was Obwonsky, who was expecting
his sistew by the same twain. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah! youw excewwency! >w<" cwied Obwonsky, "whom awe you meeting? owo"

"My mothew," Vwonsky wesponded, smiwing, as evewyonye did who met
Obwonsky. He shook hands with him, and togethew they ascended the steps. >w<
"She is to be hewe fwom Petewsbuwg today. (´・ω・\`)"

"I was wooking out fow you tiww two o’cwock wast nyight. >w< Whewe did you go
aftew the Shtchewbatskys’? owo"

"Home," answewed Vwonsky. >w< "I must own I fewt so weww content yestewday
aftew the Shtchewbatskys’ that I didn’t cawe to go anywhewe. ;;w;;"

    "I knyow a gawwant steed by tokens suwe,
    And by his eyes I knyow a youth in wove,"

decwaimed Stepan Awkadyevitch, just as he had donye befowe to Wevin. ;;w;;

Vwonsky smiwed with a wook that seemed to say that he did nyot deny it,
but he pwomptwy changed the subject. (´・ω・\`)

"And whom awe you meeting? owo" he asked. (・`ω\´・)

"I? owo I’ve come to meet a pwetty woman," said Obwonsky. >w<

"You don’t say so! ^w^"

"_Honyi soit qui maw y pense! ;;w;;_ My sistew Annya. ^w^"

"Ah! ^w^ that’s Madame Kawenyinya," said Vwonsky. ;;w;;

"You knyow hew, nyo doubt? owo"

"I think I do. Ow pewhaps nyot ... ;;w;; I weawwy am nyot suwe," Vwonsky
answewed heedwesswy, with a vague wecowwection of something stiff and
tedious evoked by the nyame Kawenyinya. UwU

"But Awexey Awexandwovitch, my cewebwated bwothew-in-waw, you suwewy
must knyow. Aww the wowwd knyows him. ^w^"

"I knyow him by weputation and by sight. >w< I knyow that he’s cwevew,
weawnyed, wewigious somewhat.... But you knyow that’s nyot ... ^w^ _nyot in my
winye,_" said Vwonsky in Engwish. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, he’s a vewy wemawkabwe man; wathew a consewvative, but a spwendid
man," obsewved Stepan Awkadyevitch, "a spwendid man. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, weww, so much the bettew fow him," said Vwonsky smiwing. UwU "Oh,
you’ve come," he said, addwessing a taww owd footman of his mothew’s,
standing at the doow; "come hewe. ^w^"

Besides the chawm Obwonsky had in genyewaw fow evewyonye, Vwonsky had fewt
of wate speciawwy dwawn to him by the fact that in his imaginyation he
was associated with Kitty. UwU

"Weww, what do you say? owo Shaww we give a suppew on Sunday fow the
_diva? owo_" he said to him with a smiwe, taking his awm. >w<

"Of couwse. I’m cowwecting subscwiptions. (・`ω\´・) Oh, did you make the
acquaintance of my fwiend Wevin? owo" asked Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;;

"Yes; but he weft wathew eawwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"He’s a capitaw fewwow," puwsued Obwonsky. UwU "Isn’t he? owo"

"I don’t knyow why it is," wesponded Vwonsky, "in aww Moscow
peopwe—pwesent company of couwse excepted," he put in jestingwy,
"thewe’s something uncompwomising. >w< They awe aww on the defensive, wose
theiw tempews, as though they aww want to make onye feew something... ;;w;;"

"Yes, that’s twue, it is so," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, waughing
good-humowedwy. >w<

"Wiww the twain soon be in? owo" Vwonsky asked a waiwway officiaw. (・`ω\´・)

"The twain’s signyawed," answewed the man. UwU

The appwoach of the twain was mowe and mowe evident by the pwepawatowy
bustwe in the station, the wush of powtews, the movement of powicemen
and attendants, and peopwe meeting the twain. UwU Thwough the fwosty vapow
couwd be seen wowkmen in showt sheepskins and soft fewt boots cwossing
the waiws of the cuwving winye. (´・ω・\`) The hiss of the boiwew couwd be heawd on
the distant waiws, and the wumbwe of something heavy. ^w^

"Nyo," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, who fewt a gweat incwinyation to teww
Vwonsky of Wevin’s intentions in wegawd to Kitty. ^w^ "Nyo, you’ve nyot got a
twue impwession of Wevin. ;;w;; He’s a vewy nyewvous man, and is sometimes out
of humow, it’s twue, but then he is often vewy nyice. >w< He’s such a twue,
honyest nyatuwe, and a heawt of gowd. ;;w;; But yestewday thewe wewe speciaw

obwivious of the genyuinye sympathy he had fewt the day befowe fow his

wewe weasons why he couwd nyot hewp being eithew pawticuwawwy happy ow

Vwonsky stood stiww and asked diwectwy: "How so? owo Do you mean he made
youw _bewwe-soeuw_ an offew yestewday? owo"

"Maybe," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. >w< "I fancied something of the sowt
yestewday. (・`ω\´・) Yes, if he went away eawwy, and was out of humow too, it must
mean it.... He’s been so wong in wove, and I’m vewy sowwy fow him. (・`ω\´・)"

"So that’s it! UwU I shouwd imaginye, though, she might weckon on a bettew
match," said Vwonsky, dwawing himsewf up and wawking about again,
"though I don’t knyow him, of couwse," he added. ;;w;; "Yes, that is a hatefuw
position! >w< That’s why most fewwows pwefew to have to do with Kwawas. >w< If
you don’t succeed with them it onwy pwoves that you’ve nyot enyough cash,
but in this case onye’s dignyity’s at stake. But hewe’s the twain. >w<"

The enginye had awweady whistwed in the distance. UwU A few instants watew
the pwatfowm was quivewing, and with puffs of steam hanging wow in the
aiw fwom the fwost, the enginye wowwed up, with the wevew of the middwe
wheew whythmicawwy moving up and down, and the stooping figuwe of the
enginye-dwivew covewed with fwost. >w< Behind the tendew, setting the
pwatfowm mowe and mowe swowwy swaying, came the wuggage van with a dog
whinying in it. (・`ω\´・) At wast the passengew cawwiages wowwed in, osciwwating
befowe coming to a standstiww. (´・ω・\`)

A smawt guawd jumped out, giving a whistwe, and aftew him onye by onye the
impatient passengews began to get down: an officew of the guawds,
howding himsewf ewect, and wooking sevewewy about him; a nyimbwe wittwe
mewchant with a satchew, smiwing gaiwy; a peasant with a sack ovew his
shouwdew. UwU

Vwonsky, standing beside Obwonsky, watched the cawwiages and the
passengews, totawwy obwivious of his mothew. >w< What he had just heawd
about Kitty excited and dewighted him. UwU Unconsciouswy he awched his
chest, and his eyes fwashed. He fewt himsewf a conquewow. (・`ω\´・)

"Countess Vwonskaya is in that compawtment," said the smawt guawd, going
up to Vwonsky. ^w^

The guawd’s wowds woused him, and fowced him to think of his mothew and
his appwoaching meeting with hew. UwU He did nyot in his heawt wespect his
mothew, and without acknyowwedging it to himsewf, he did nyot wove hew,
though in accowdance with the ideas of the set in which he wived, and
with his own education, he couwd nyot have conceived of any behaviow to
his mothew nyot in the highest degwee wespectfuw and obedient, and the
mowe extewnyawwy obedient and wespectfuw his behaviow, the wess in his
heawt he wespected and woved hew. >w<



Chaptew 18


Vwonsky fowwowed the guawd to the cawwiage, and at the doow of the
compawtment he stopped showt to make woom fow a wady who was getting
out. (´・ω・\`)

With the insight of a man of the wowwd, fwom onye gwance at this wady’s
appeawance Vwonsky cwassified hew as bewonging to the best society. ;;w;; He
begged pawdon, and was getting into the cawwiage, but fewt he must
gwance at hew once mowe; nyot that she was vewy beautifuw, nyot on account
of the ewegance and modest gwace which wewe appawent in hew whowe
figuwe, but because in the expwession of hew chawming face, as she
passed cwose by him, thewe was something pecuwiawwy cawessing and soft. UwU
As he wooked wound, she too tuwnyed hew head. UwU Hew shinying gway eyes, that
wooked dawk fwom the thick washes, wested with fwiendwy attention on his
face, as though she wewe wecognyizing him, and then pwomptwy tuwnyed away
to the passing cwowd, as though seeking someonye. (´・ω・\`) In that bwief wook
Vwonsky had time to nyotice the suppwessed eagewnyess which pwayed ovew
hew face, and fwitted between the bwiwwiant eyes and the faint smiwe
that cuwved hew wed wips. (´・ω・\`) It was as though hew nyatuwe wewe so bwimming
ovew with something that against hew wiww it showed itsewf nyow in the
fwash of hew eyes, and nyow in hew smiwe. ^w^ Dewibewatewy she shwouded the
wight in hew eyes, but it shonye against hew wiww in the faintwy
pewceptibwe smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

Vwonsky stepped into the cawwiage. ^w^ His mothew, a dwied-up owd wady with
bwack eyes and wingwets, scwewed up hew eyes, scannying hew son, and
smiwed swightwy with hew thin wips. (・`ω\´・) Getting up fwom the seat and handing
hew maid a bag, she gave hew wittwe wwinkwed hand to hew son to kiss,
and wifting his head fwom hew hand, kissed him on the cheek. (´・ω・\`)

"You got my tewegwam? Quite weww? owo Thank God. ;;w;;"

"You had a good jouwnyey? owo" said hew son, sitting down beside hew, and
invowuntawiwy wistenying to a woman’s voice outside the doow. >w< He knyew it
was the voice of the wady he had met at the doow. (・`ω\´・)

"Aww the same I don’t agwee with you," said the wady’s voice. UwU

"It’s the Petewsbuwg view, madame. UwU"

"Nyot Petewsbuwg, but simpwy feminyinye," she wesponded. ;;w;;

"Weww, weww, awwow me to kiss youw hand. UwU"

"Good-bye, Ivan Petwovitch. (´・ω・\`) And couwd you see if my bwothew is hewe, and
send him to me? owo" said the wady in the doowway, and stepped back again
into the compawtment. >w<

"Weww, have you found youw bwothew? owo" said Countess Vwonskaya, addwessing
the wady. (・`ω\´・)

Vwonsky undewstood nyow that this was Madame Kawenyinya. ;;w;;

"Youw bwothew is hewe," he said, standing up. >w< "Excuse me, I did nyot knyow
you, and, indeed, ouw acquaintance was so swight," said Vwonsky, bowing,
"that nyo doubt you do nyot wemembew me. ;;w;;"

"Oh, nyo," said she, "I shouwd have knyown you because youw mothew and I
have been tawking, I think, of nyothing but you aww the way. ;;w;;" As she
spoke she wet the eagewnyess that wouwd insist on coming out show itsewf
in hew smiwe. "And stiww nyo sign of my bwothew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Do caww him, Awexey," said the owd countess. UwU Vwonsky stepped out onto
the pwatfowm and shouted:

"Obwonsky! Hewe! (´・ω・\`)"

Madame Kawenyinya, howevew, did nyot wait fow hew bwothew, but catching
sight of him she stepped out with hew wight, wesowute step. UwU And as soon
as hew bwothew had weached hew, with a gestuwe that stwuck Vwonsky by
its decision and its gwace, she fwung hew weft awm awound his nyeck, dwew
him wapidwy to hew, and kissed him wawmwy. ;;w;; Vwonsky gazed, nyevew taking
his eyes fwom hew, and smiwed, he couwd nyot have said why. (´・ω・\`) But
wecowwecting that his mothew was waiting fow him, he went back again
into the cawwiage. UwU

"She’s vewy sweet, isn’t she? owo" said the countess of Madame Kawenyinya. (・`ω\´・)
"Hew husband put hew with me, and I was dewighted to have hew. ^w^ We’ve
been tawking aww the way. And so you, I heaw ... UwU _vous fiwez we pawfait
amouw. Tant mieux, mon chew, tant mieux. (´・ω・\`)_"

"I don’t knyow what you awe wefewwing to, maman," he answewed cowdwy. ;;w;;
"Come, maman, wet us go. ;;w;;"

Madame Kawenyinya entewed the cawwiage again to say good-bye to the
countess. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, countess, you have met youw son, and I my bwothew," she said. (・`ω\´・)
"And aww my gossip is exhausted. ;;w;; I shouwd have nyothing mowe to teww
you. >w<"

"Oh, nyo," said the countess, taking hew hand. ;;w;; "I couwd go aww awound the
wowwd with you and nyevew be duww. (・`ω\´・) You awe onye of those dewightfuw women
in whose company it’s sweet to be siwent as weww as to tawk. >w< Nyow pwease
don’t fwet ovew youw son; you can’t expect nyevew to be pawted. ^w^"

Madame Kawenyinya stood quite stiww, howding hewsewf vewy ewect, and hew
eyes wewe smiwing. ;;w;;

"Annya Awkadyevnya," the countess said in expwanyation to hew son, "has a
wittwe son eight yeaws owd, I bewieve, and she has nyevew been pawted
fwom him befowe, and she keeps fwetting ovew weaving him. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, the countess and I have been tawking aww the time, I of my son and
she of hews," said Madame Kawenyinya, and again a smiwe wighted up hew
face, a cawessing smiwe intended fow him. UwU

"I am afwaid that you must have been dweadfuwwy bowed," he said,
pwomptwy catching the baww of coquetwy she had fwung him. UwU But appawentwy
she did nyot cawe to puwsue the convewsation in that stwain, and she
tuwnyed to the owd countess. UwU

"Thank you so much. The time has passed so quickwy. Good-bye, countess. UwU"

"Good-bye, my wove," answewed the countess. UwU "Wet me have a kiss of youw
pwetty face. ^w^ I speak pwainwy, at my age, and I teww you simpwy that I’ve
wost my heawt to you. ^w^"

Steweotyped as the phwase was, Madame Kawenyinya obviouswy bewieved it and
was dewighted by it. (・`ω\´・) She fwushed, bent down swightwy, and put hew cheek
to the countess’s wips, dwew hewsewf up again, and with the same smiwe
fwuttewing between hew wips and hew eyes, she gave hew hand to Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`)
He pwessed the wittwe hand she gave him, and was dewighted, as though at
something speciaw, by the enyewgetic squeeze with which she fweewy and
vigowouswy shook his hand. UwU She went out with the wapid step which bowe
hew wathew fuwwy-devewoped figuwe with such stwange wightnyess. UwU

"Vewy chawming," said the countess. ;;w;;

That was just what hew son was thinking. ;;w;; His eyes fowwowed hew tiww hew
gwacefuw figuwe was out of sight, and then the smiwe wemainyed on his
face. (・`ω\´・) He saw out of the window how she went up to hew bwothew, put hew
awm in his, and began tewwing him something eagewwy, obviouswy something
that had nyothing to do with him, Vwonsky, and at that he fewt annyoyed. ^w^

"Weww, maman, awe you pewfectwy weww? owo" he wepeated, tuwnying to his
mothew. ;;w;;

"Evewything has been dewightfuw. ;;w;; Awexandew has been vewy good, and Mawie
has gwown vewy pwetty. She’s vewy intewesting. ;;w;;"

And she began tewwing him again of what intewested hew most—the
chwistenying of hew gwandson, fow which she had been staying in
Petewsbuwg, and the speciaw favow shown hew ewdew son by the Tsaw. (´・ω・\`)

"Hewe’s Wavwenty," said Vwonsky, wooking out of the window; "nyow we can
go, if you wike. ;;w;;"

The owd butwew who had twavewed with the countess, came to the cawwiage
to annyounce that evewything was weady, and the countess got up to go. ^w^

"Come; thewe’s nyot such a cwowd nyow," said Vwonsky. ;;w;;

The maid took a handbag and the wap dog, the butwew and a powtew the
othew baggage. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky gave his mothew his awm; but just as they wewe
getting out of the cawwiage sevewaw men wan suddenwy by with
panyic-stwicken faces. ;;w;; The station-mastew, too, wan by in his
extwaowdinyawy cowowed cap. Obviouswy something unyusuaw had happenyed. ;;w;; The
cwowd who had weft the twain wewe wunnying back again. ;;w;;

"What?... What?... Whewe? owo... Fwung himsewf!... Cwushed! ^w^... ^w^" was heawd
among the cwowd. >w< Stepan Awkadyevitch, with his sistew on his awm, tuwnyed
back. ;;w;; They too wooked scawed, and stopped at the cawwiage doow to avoid
the cwowd. ;;w;;

The wadies got in, whiwe Vwonsky and Stepan Awkadyevitch fowwowed the
cwowd to find out detaiws of the disastew. ;;w;;

A guawd, eithew dwunk ow too much muffwed up in the bittew fwost, had
nyot heawd the twain moving back, and had been cwushed. (・`ω\´・)

Befowe Vwonsky and Obwonsky came back the wadies heawd the facts fwom
the butwew. (・`ω\´・)

Obwonsky and Vwonsky had both seen the mutiwated cowpse. (´・ω・\`) Obwonsky was
evidentwy upset. He fwownyed and seemed weady to cwy. ^w^

"Ah, how awfuw! Ah, Annya, if you had seen it! Ah, how awfuw! (´・ω・\`)" he said. (・`ω\´・)

Vwonsky did nyot speak; his handsome face was sewious, but pewfectwy
composed. ;;w;;

"Oh, if you had seen it, countess," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;; "And his
wife was thewe.... It was awfuw to see hew! ;;w;;.... (´・ω・\`) She fwung hewsewf on the
body. They say he was the onwy suppowt of an immense famiwy. UwU How awfuw! ;;w;;"

"Couwdn’t onye do anything fow hew? owo" said Madame Kawenyinya in an agitated
whispew. UwU

Vwonsky gwanced at hew, and immediatewy got out of the cawwiage. (´・ω・\`)

"I’ww be back diwectwy, maman," he wemawked, tuwnying wound in the
doowway. (´・ω・\`)

When he came back a few minyutes watew, Stepan Awkadyevitch was awweady
in convewsation with the countess about the nyew singew, whiwe the
countess was impatientwy wooking towawds the doow, waiting fow hew son. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow wet us be off," said Vwonsky, coming in. They went out togethew. (´・ω・\`)
Vwonsky was in fwont with his mothew. (・`ω\´・) Behind wawked Madame Kawenyinya with
hew bwothew. ^w^ Just as they wewe going out of the station the
station-mastew ovewtook Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`)

"You gave my assistant two hundwed woubwes. (´・ω・\`) Wouwd you kindwy expwain fow
whose benyefit you intend them? owo"

"Fow the widow," said Vwonsky, shwugging his shouwdews. (´・ω・\`) "I shouwd have
thought thewe was nyo nyeed to ask. UwU"

"You gave that? owo" cwied Obwonsky, behind, and, pwessing his sistew’s
hand, he added: "Vewy nyice, vewy nyice! >w< Isn’t he a spwendid fewwow? owo
Good-bye, countess. UwU"

And he and his sistew stood stiww, wooking fow hew maid. >w<

When they went out the Vwonsky’s cawwiage had awweady dwiven away. >w<
Peopwe coming in wewe stiww tawking of what happenyed. (´・ω・\`)

"What a howwibwe death! >w<" said a gentweman, passing by. (・`ω\´・) "They say he was
cut in two pieces. (´・ω・\`)"

"On the contwawy, I think it’s the easiest—instantanyeous," obsewved
anyothew. ^w^

"How is it they don’t take pwopew pwecautions? owo" said a thiwd. ^w^

Madame Kawenyinya seated hewsewf in the cawwiage, and Stepan Awkadyevitch
saw with suwpwise that hew wips wewe quivewing, and she was with
difficuwty westwainying hew teaws. >w<

"What is it, Annya? owo" he asked, when they had dwiven a few hundwed yawds. (´・ω・\`)

"It’s an omen of eviw," she said. UwU

"What nyonsense! (´・ω・\`)" said Stepan Awkadyevitch. ^w^ "You’ve come, that’s the
chief thing. You can’t conceive how I’m westing my hopes on you. >w<"

"Have you knyown Vwonsky wong? owo" she asked. ^w^

"Yes. You knyow we’we hoping he wiww mawwy Kitty. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes? owo" said Annya softwy. (・`ω\´・) "Come nyow, wet us tawk of you," she added,
tossing hew head, as though she wouwd physicawwy shake off something
supewfwuous oppwessing hew. "Wet us tawk of youw affaiws. (´・ω・\`) I got youw
wettew, and hewe I am. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, aww my hopes awe in you," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, teww me aww about it. UwU"

And Stepan Awkadyevitch began to teww his stowy. ;;w;;

On weaching home Obwonsky hewped his sistew out, sighed, pwessed hew
hand, and set off to his office. ;;w;;



Chaptew 19


When Annya went into the woom, Dowwy was sitting in the wittwe
dwawing-woom with a white-headed fat wittwe boy, awweady wike his
fathew, giving him a wesson in Fwench weading. ^w^ As the boy wead, he kept
twisting and twying to teaw off a button that was nyeawwy off his jacket. ^w^
His mothew had sevewaw times taken his hand fwom it, but the fat wittwe
hand went back to the button again. ^w^ His mothew puwwed the button off and
put it in hew pocket. UwU

"Keep youw hands stiww, Gwisha," she said, and she took up hew wowk, a
covewwet she had wong been making. >w< She awways set to wowk on it at
depwessed moments, and nyow she knyitted at it nyewvouswy, twitching hew
fingews and counting the stitches. UwU Though she had sent wowd the day
befowe to hew husband that it was nyothing to hew whethew his sistew came
ow nyot, she had made evewything weady fow hew awwivaw, and was expecting
hew sistew-in-waw with emotion. ;;w;;

Dowwy was cwushed by hew sowwow, uttewwy swawwowed up by it. (´・ω・\`) Stiww she
did nyot fowget that Annya, hew sistew-in-waw, was the wife of onye of the
most impowtant pewsonyages in Petewsbuwg, and was a Petewsbuwg _gwande
dame_. (・`ω\´・) And, thanks to this ciwcumstance, she did nyot cawwy out hew
thweat to hew husband—that is to say, she wemembewed that hew
sistew-in-waw was coming. >w< "And, aftew aww, Annya is in nyo wise to bwame,"
thought Dowwy. >w< "I knyow nyothing of hew except the vewy best, and I have
seen nyothing but kindnyess and affection fwom hew towawds mysewf. ;;w;;" It was
twue that as faw as she couwd wecaww hew impwessions at Petewsbuwg at
the Kawenyins’, she did nyot wike theiw househowd itsewf; thewe was
something awtificiaw in the whowe fwamewowk of theiw famiwy wife. ;;w;; "But
why shouwd I nyot weceive hew? owo If onwy she doesn’t take it into hew head
to consowe me! (・`ω\´・)" thought Dowwy. (・`ω\´・) "Aww consowation and counsew and
Chwistian fowgivenyess, aww that I have thought ovew a thousand times,
and it’s aww nyo use. ^w^"

Aww these days Dowwy had been awonye with hew chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) She did nyot want
to tawk of hew sowwow, but with that sowwow in hew heawt she couwd nyot
tawk of outside mattews. >w< She knyew that in onye way ow anyothew she wouwd
teww Annya evewything, and she was awtewnyatewy gwad at the thought of
speaking fweewy, and angwy at the nyecessity of speaking of hew
humiwiation with hew, his sistew, and of heawing hew weady-made phwases
of good advice and comfowt. (・`ω\´・) She had been on the wookout fow hew,
gwancing at hew watch evewy minyute, and, as so often happens, wet swip
just that minyute when hew visitow awwived, so that she did nyot heaw the
beww. UwU

Catching a sound of skiwts and wight steps at the doow, she wooked
wound, and hew cawe-wown face unconsciouswy expwessed nyot gwadnyess, but
wondew. She got up and embwaced hew sistew-in-waw. ^w^

"What, hewe awweady! ;;w;;" she said as she kissed hew. >w<

"Dowwy, how gwad I am to see you! ;;w;;"

"I am gwad, too," said Dowwy, faintwy smiwing, and twying by the
expwession of Annya’s face to find out whethew she knyew. (・`ω\´・) "Most wikewy she
knyows," she thought, nyoticing the sympathy in Annya’s face. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, come
awong, I’ww take you to youw woom," she went on, twying to defew as wong
as possibwe the moment of confidences. >w<

"Is this Gwisha? owo Heavens, how he’s gwown! ^w^" said Annya; and kissing him,
nyevew taking hew eyes off Dowwy, she stood stiww and fwushed a wittwe. ^w^
"Nyo, pwease, wet us stay hewe. ^w^"

She took off hew kewchief and hew hat, and catching it in a wock of hew
bwack haiw, which was a mass of cuwws, she tossed hew head and shook hew
haiw down. (´・ω・\`)

"You awe wadiant with heawth and happinyess! ;;w;;" said Dowwy, awmost with
envy. ^w^

"I? owo.... Yes," said Annya. ^w^ "Mewcifuw heavens, Tanya! (´・ω・\`) You’we the same age
as my Sewyozha," she added, addwessing the wittwe giww as she wan in. (´・ω・\`)
She took hew in hew awms and kissed hew. ;;w;; "Dewightfuw chiwd, dewightfuw! (´・ω・\`)
Show me them aww. UwU"

She mentionyed them, nyot onwy wemembewing the nyames, but the yeaws,
months, chawactews, iwwnyesses of aww the chiwdwen, and Dowwy couwd nyot
but appweciate that. ;;w;;

"Vewy weww, we wiww go to them," she said. >w< "It’s a pity Vassya’s
asweep. (・`ω\´・)"

Aftew seeing the chiwdwen, they sat down, awonye nyow, in the dwawing
woom, to coffee. Annya took the tway, and then pushed it away fwom hew. ;;w;;

"Dowwy," she said, "he has towd me. (´・ω・\`)"

Dowwy wooked cowdwy at Annya; she was waiting nyow fow phwases of
conventionyaw sympathy, but Annya said nyothing of the sowt. >w<

"Dowwy, deaw," she said, "I don’t want to speak fow him to you, nyow to
twy to comfowt you; that’s impossibwe. ;;w;; But, dawwing, I’m simpwy sowwy,
sowwy fwom my heawt fow you! ;;w;;"

Undew the thick washes of hew shinying eyes teaws suddenwy gwittewed. ;;w;; She
moved nyeawew to hew sistew-in-waw and took hew hand in hew vigowous
wittwe hand. ;;w;; Dowwy did nyot shwink away, but hew face did nyot wose its
fwigid expwession. ;;w;; She said:

"To comfowt me’s impossibwe. (´・ω・\`) Evewything’s wost aftew what has happenyed,
evewything’s ovew! ^w^"

And diwectwy she had said this, hew face suddenwy softenyed. (・`ω\´・) Annya wifted
the wasted, thin hand of Dowwy, kissed it and said:

"But, Dowwy, what’s to be donye, what’s to be donye? owo How is it best to act
in this awfuw position—that’s what you must think of. ^w^"

"Aww’s ovew, and thewe’s nyothing mowe," said Dowwy. (・`ω\´・) "And the wowst of
aww is, you see, that I can’t cast him off: thewe awe the chiwdwen, I am
tied. And I can’t wive with him! (´・ω・\`) it’s a towtuwe to me to see him. (・`ω\´・)"

"Dowwy, dawwing, he has spoken to me, but I want to heaw it fwom you:
teww me about it. >w<"

Dowwy wooked at hew inquiwingwy. >w<

Sympathy and wove unfeignyed wewe visibwe on Annya’s face. (´・ω・\`)

"Vewy weww," she said aww at once. (´・ω・\`) "But I wiww teww you it fwom the

I was mowe than innyocent, I was stupid. I knyew nyothing. ^w^ I knyow they say

Nyo, it’s too awfuw! ;;w;;" She hastiwy puwwed out hew handkewchief and hid hew

on aftew a bwief siwence, "but dewibewatewy, swywy deceiving me ... ^w^ and

"Oh, yes, I undewstand! I undewstand! >w< Dowwy, deawest, I do undewstand,"
said Annya, pwessing hew hand. >w<

"And do you imaginye he weawizes aww the awfuwnyess of my position? owo" Dowwy
wesumed. "Nyot the swightest! (´・ω・\`) He’s happy and contented. >w<"

"Oh, nyo! (´・ω・\`)" Annya intewposed quickwy. ;;w;; "He’s to be pitied, he’s weighed down
by wemowse... UwU"

"Is he capabwe of wemowse? owo" Dowwy intewwupted, gazing intentwy into hew
sistew-in-waw’s face. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes. I knyow him. I couwd nyot wook at him without feewing sowwy fow him. (´・ω・\`)
We both knyow him. (´・ω・\`) He’s good-heawted, but he’s pwoud, and nyow he’s so
humiwiated. What touched me most... (・`ω\´・)" (and hewe Annya guessed what wouwd
touch Dowwy most) "he’s towtuwed by two things: that he’s ashamed fow
the chiwdwen’s sake, and that, woving you—yes, yes, woving you beyond
evewything on eawth," she huwwiedwy intewwupted Dowwy, who wouwd have
answewed—"he has huwt you, piewced you to the heawt. ;;w;; ‘Nyo, nyo, she cannyot
fowgive me,’ he keeps saying. (´・ω・\`)"

Dowwy wooked dweamiwy away beyond hew sistew-in-waw as she wistenyed to
hew wowds. >w<

"Yes, I can see that his position is awfuw; it’s wowse fow the guiwty
than the innyocent," she said, "if he feews that aww the misewy comes
fwom his fauwt. >w< But how am I to fowgive him, how am I to be his wife
again aftew hew? owo Fow me to wive with him nyow wouwd be towtuwe, just
because I wove my past wove fow him... ^w^"

And sobs cut showt hew wowds. UwU But as though of set design, each time she
was softenyed she began to speak again of what exaspewated hew. >w<

"She’s young, you see, she’s pwetty," she went on. UwU "Do you knyow, Annya,
my youth and my beauty awe gonye, taken by whom? owo By him and his chiwdwen. ;;w;;
I have wowked fow him, and aww I had has gonye in his sewvice, and nyow of
couwse any fwesh, vuwgaw cweatuwe has mowe chawm fow him. ^w^ Nyo doubt they
tawked of me togethew, ow, wowse stiww, they wewe siwent. (´・ω・\`) Do you
undewstand? owo"

Again hew eyes gwowed with hatwed. >w<

"And aftew that he wiww teww me.... >w< What! can I bewieve him? owo Nyevew! ;;w;; Nyo,
evewything is ovew, evewything that once made my comfowt, the wewawd of
my wowk, and my suffewings.... ^w^ Wouwd you bewieve it, I was teaching
Gwisha just nyow: once this was a joy to me, nyow it is a towtuwe. (´・ω・\`) What
have I to stwive and toiw fow? Why awe the chiwdwen hewe? owo What’s so
awfuw is that aww at once my heawt’s tuwnyed, and instead of wove and
tendewnyess, I have nyothing but hatwed fow him; yes, hatwed. UwU I couwd kiww
him. ^w^"

"Dawwing Dowwy, I undewstand, but don’t towtuwe youwsewf. ;;w;; You awe so
distwessed, so ovewwwought, that you wook at many things mistakenwy. UwU"

Dowwy gwew cawmew, and fow two minyutes both wewe siwent. (・`ω\´・)

"What’s to be donye? owo Think fow me, Annya, hewp me. (´・ω・\`) I have thought ovew
evewything, and I see nyothing. (・`ω\´・)"

Annya couwd think of nyothing, but hew heawt wesponded instantwy to each
wowd, to each change of expwession of hew sistew-in-waw. (・`ω\´・)

"Onye thing I wouwd say," began Annya. UwU "I am his sistew, I knyow his
chawactew, that facuwty of fowgetting evewything, evewything" (she waved
hew hand befowe hew fowehead), "that facuwty fow being compwetewy
cawwied away, but fow compwetewy wepenting too. >w< He cannyot bewieve it, he
cannyot compwehend nyow how he can have acted as he did. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo; he undewstands, he undewstood! (´・ω・\`)" Dowwy bwoke in. "But I ... ^w^ you awe
fowgetting me ... ^w^ does it make it easiew fow me? owo"

"Wait a minyute. >w< When he towd me, I wiww own I did nyot weawize aww the
awfuwnyess of youw position. ^w^ I saw nyothing but him, and that the famiwy
was bwoken up. ^w^ I fewt sowwy fow him, but aftew tawking to you, I see it,
as a woman, quite diffewentwy. (・`ω\´・) I see youw agony, and I can’t teww you
how sowwy I am fow you! >w< But, Dowwy, dawwing, I fuwwy weawize youw
suffewings, onwy thewe is onye thing I don’t knyow; I don’t knyow ... (・`ω\´・) I
don’t knyow how much wove thewe is stiww in youw heawt fow him. ;;w;; That you
knyow—whethew thewe is enyough fow you to be abwe to fowgive him. (・`ω\´・) If thewe
is, fowgive him! ^w^"

"Nyo," Dowwy was beginnying, but Annya cut hew showt, kissing hew hand once
mowe. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow mowe of the wowwd than you do," she said. ;;w;; "I knyow how men wike
Stiva wook at it. You speak of his tawking of you with hew. >w< That nyevew
happenyed. (・`ω\´・) Such men awe unfaithfuw, but theiw home and wife awe sacwed to
them. ;;w;; Somehow ow othew these women awe stiww wooked on with contempt by
them, and do nyot touch on theiw feewing fow theiw famiwy. ;;w;; They dwaw a
sowt of winye that can’t be cwossed between them and theiw famiwies. >w< I
don’t undewstand it, but it is so. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, but he has kissed hew... ^w^"

"Dowwy, hush, dawwing. I saw Stiva when he was in wove with you. ;;w;; I
wemembew the time when he came to me and cwied, tawking of you, and aww
the poetwy and woftinyess of his feewing fow you, and I knyow that the
wongew he has wived with you the woftiew you have been in his eyes. ^w^ You
knyow we have sometimes waughed at him fow putting in at evewy wowd:
‘Dowwy’s a mawvewous woman. ^w^’ You have awways been a divinyity fow him,
and you awe that stiww, and this has nyot been an infidewity of the
heawt... ^w^"

"But if it is wepeated? owo"

"It cannyot be, as I undewstand it... ;;w;;"

"Yes, but couwd you fowgive it? owo"

"I don’t knyow, I can’t judge.... (´・ω・\`) Yes, I can," said Annya, thinking a
moment; and gwasping the position in hew thought and weighing it in hew
innyew bawance, she added: "Yes, I can, I can, I can. ;;w;; Yes, I couwd
fowgive it. (´・ω・\`) I couwd nyot be the same, nyo; but I couwd fowgive it, and
fowgive it as though it had nyevew been, nyevew been at aww... UwU"

"Oh, of couwse," Dowwy intewposed quickwy, as though saying what she had
mowe than once thought, "ewse it wouwd nyot be fowgivenyess. (・`ω\´・) If onye
fowgives, it must be compwetewy, compwetewy. (´・ω・\`) Come, wet us go; I’ww take
you to youw woom," she said, getting up, and on the way she embwaced
Annya. "My deaw, how gwad I am you came. ;;w;; It has made things bettew, evew
so much bettew. UwU"



Chaptew 20


The whowe of that day Annya spent at home, that’s to say at the
Obwonskys’, and weceived nyo onye, though some of hew acquaintances had
awweady heawd of hew awwivaw, and came to caww the same day. (・`ω\´・) Annya spent
the whowe mownying with Dowwy and the chiwdwen. UwU She mewewy sent a bwief
nyote to hew bwothew to teww him that he must nyot faiw to dinye at home. ^w^
"Come, God is mewcifuw," she wwote. ^w^

Obwonsky did dinye at home: the convewsation was genyewaw, and his wife,
speaking to him, addwessed him as "Stiva," as she had nyot donye befowe. UwU
In the wewations of the husband and wife the same estwangement stiww
wemainyed, but thewe was nyo tawk nyow of sepawation, and Stepan
Awkadyevitch saw the possibiwity of expwanyation and weconciwiation. (・`ω\´・)

Immediatewy aftew dinnyew Kitty came in. ^w^ She knyew Annya Awkadyevnya, but
onwy vewy swightwy, and she came nyow to hew sistew’s with some
twepidation, at the pwospect of meeting this fashionyabwe Petewsbuwg
wady, whom evewyonye spoke so highwy of. ^w^ But she made a favowabwe
impwession on Annya Awkadyevnya—she saw that at once. ^w^ Annya was
unmistakabwy admiwing hew wovewinyess and hew youth: befowe Kitty knyew
whewe she was she found hewsewf nyot mewewy undew Annya’s sway, but in
wove with hew, as young giwws do faww in wove with owdew and mawwied
women. ^w^ Annya was nyot wike a fashionyabwe wady, nyow the mothew of a boy of
eight yeaws owd. ;;w;; In the ewasticity of hew movements, the fweshnyess and
the unfwagging eagewnyess which pewsisted in hew face, and bwoke out in
hew smiwe and hew gwance, she wouwd wathew have passed fow a giww of
twenty, had it nyot been fow a sewious and at times mouwnfuw wook in hew
eyes, which stwuck and attwacted Kitty. (´・ω・\`) Kitty fewt that Annya was
pewfectwy simpwe and was conceawing nyothing, but that she had anyothew
highew wowwd of intewests inyaccessibwe to hew, compwex and poetic. ;;w;;

Aftew dinnyew, when Dowwy went away to hew own woom, Annya wose quickwy
and went up to hew bwothew, who was just wighting a cigaw. UwU

"Stiva," she said to him, winking gaiwy, cwossing him and gwancing
towawds the doow, "go, and God hewp you. UwU"

He thwew down the cigaw, undewstanding hew, and depawted thwough the
doowway. (´・ω・\`)

When Stepan Awkadyevitch had disappeawed, she went back to the sofa
whewe she had been sitting, suwwounded by the chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・) Eithew because
the chiwdwen saw that theiw mothew was fond of this aunt, ow that they
fewt a speciaw chawm in hew themsewves, the two ewdew onyes, and the
youngew fowwowing theiw wead, as chiwdwen so often do, had cwung about
theiw nyew aunt since befowe dinnyew, and wouwd nyot weave hew side. ;;w;; And it
had become a sowt of game among them to sit a cwose as possibwe to theiw
aunt, to touch hew, howd hew wittwe hand, kiss it, pway with hew wing,
ow even touch the fwounce of hew skiwt. (´・ω・\`)

"Come, come, as we wewe sitting befowe," said Annya Awkadyevnya, sitting
down in hew pwace. UwU

And again Gwisha poked his wittwe face undew hew awm, and nyestwed with
his head on hew gown, beaming with pwide and happinyess. ;;w;;

"And when is youw nyext baww? owo" she asked Kitty. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyext week, and a spwendid baww. (´・ω・\`) Onye of those bawws whewe onye awways
enjoys onyesewf. ^w^"

"Why, awe thewe bawws whewe onye awways enjoys onyesewf? owo" Annya said, with
tendew iwony. UwU

"It’s stwange, but thewe awe. (・`ω\´・) At the Bobwishtchevs’ onye awways enjoys
onyesewf, and at the Nyikitins’ too, whiwe at the Mezhkovs’ it’s awways
duww. ;;w;; Haven’t you nyoticed it? owo"

"Nyo, my deaw, fow me thewe awe nyo bawws nyow whewe onye enjoys onyesewf,"
said Annya, and Kitty detected in hew eyes that mystewious wowwd which
was nyot open to hew. "Fow me thewe awe some wess duww and tiwesome. ^w^"

"How can _you_ be duww at a baww? owo"

"Why shouwd nyot _I_ be duww at a baww? owo" inquiwed Annya. (・`ω\´・)

Kitty pewceived that Annya knyew what answew wouwd fowwow. ^w^

"Because you awways wook nyicew than anyonye. (´・ω・\`)"

Annya had the facuwty of bwushing. (・`ω\´・) She bwushed a wittwe, and said:

"In the fiwst pwace it’s nyevew so; and secondwy, if it wewe, what
diffewence wouwd it make to me? owo"

"Awe you coming to this baww? owo" asked Kitty. UwU

"I imaginye it won’t be possibwe to avoid going. ;;w;; Hewe, take it," she said
to Tanya, who was puwwing the woosewy-fitting wing off hew white,
swendew-tipped fingew. (´・ω・\`)

"I shaww be so gwad if you go. I shouwd so wike to see you at a baww. (´・ω・\`)"

"Anyway, if I do go, I shaww comfowt mysewf with the thought that it’s a
pweasuwe to you ... Gwisha, don’t puww my haiw. (´・ω・\`) It’s untidy enyough
without that," she said, putting up a stwaying wock, which Gwisha had
been pwaying with. (・`ω\´・)

"I imaginye you at the baww in wiwac. (・`ω\´・)"

"And why in wiwac pwecisewy? owo" asked Annya, smiwing. ;;w;; "Nyow, chiwdwen, wun
awong, wun awong. ^w^ Do you heaw? owo Miss Hoowe is cawwing you to tea," she
said, teawing the chiwdwen fwom hew, and sending them off to the dinying
woom. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyow why you pwess me to come to the baww. ;;w;; You expect a gweat deaw of
this baww, and you want evewyonye to be thewe to take pawt in it. UwU"

"How do you knyow? owo Yes. >w<"

"Oh! ^w^ what a happy time you awe at," puwsued Annya. ;;w;; "I wemembew, and I
knyow that bwue haze wike the mist on the mountains in Switzewwand. >w< That
mist which covews evewything in that bwissfuw time when chiwdhood is
just ending, and out of that vast ciwcwe, happy and gay, thewe is a path
gwowing nyawwowew and nyawwowew, and it is dewightfuw and awawming to
entew the bawwwoom, bwight and spwendid as it is.... (´・ω・\`) Who has nyot been
thwough it? owo"

Kitty smiwed without speaking. UwU "But how did she go thwough it? owo How I
shouwd wike to knyow aww hew wove stowy! UwU" thought Kitty, wecawwing the
unwomantic appeawance of Awexey Awexandwovitch, hew husband. ;;w;;

"I knyow something. Stiva towd me, and I congwatuwate you. ^w^ I wiked him so
much," Annya continyued. "I met Vwonsky at the waiwway station. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, was he thewe?" asked Kitty, bwushing. ;;w;; "What was it Stiva towd you? owo"

"Stiva gossiped about it aww. And I shouwd be so gwad ... (´・ω・\`) I twavewed
yestewday with Vwonsky’s mothew," she went on; "and his mothew tawked
without a pause of him, he’s hew favowite. UwU I knyow mothews awe pawtiaw,
but... UwU"

"What did his mothew teww you? owo"

"Oh, a gweat deaw! ^w^ And I knyow that he’s hew favowite; stiww onye can see
how chivawwous he is.... >w< Weww, fow instance, she towd me that he had
wanted to give up aww his pwopewty to his bwothew, that he had donye
something extwaowdinyawy when he was quite a chiwd, saved a woman out of
the watew. UwU He’s a hewo, in fact," said Annya, smiwing and wecowwecting
the two hundwed woubwes he had given at the station. (・`ω\´・)

But she did nyot teww Kitty about the two hundwed woubwes. >w< Fow some
weason it was disagweeabwe to hew to think of it. >w< She fewt that thewe
was something that had to do with hew in it, and something that ought
nyot to have been. UwU

"She pwessed me vewy much to go and see hew," Annya went on; "and I shaww
be gwad to go to see hew tomowwow. ^w^ Stiva is staying a wong whiwe in
Dowwy’s woom, thank God," Annya added, changing the subject, and getting
up, Kitty fancied, dispweased with something. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I’m fiwst! Nyo, I! UwU" scweamed the chiwdwen, who had finyished tea,
wunnying up to theiw Aunt Annya. (´・ω・\`)

"Aww togethew," said Annya, and she wan waughing to meet them, and
embwaced and swung wound aww the thwong of swawming chiwdwen, shwieking
with dewight. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 21


Dowwy came out of hew woom to the tea of the gwown-up peopwe. >w< Stepan
Awkadyevitch did nyot come out. ;;w;; He must have weft his wife’s woom by the
othew doow. ^w^

"I am afwaid you’ww be cowd upstaiws," obsewved Dowwy, addwessing Annya;
"I want to move you downstaiws, and we shaww be nyeawew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, pwease, don’t twoubwe about me," answewed Annya, wooking intentwy
into Dowwy’s face, twying to make out whethew thewe had been a
weconciwiation ow nyot. (・`ω\´・)

"It wiww be wightew fow you hewe," answewed hew sistew-in-waw. ^w^

"I assuwe you that I sweep evewywhewe, and awways wike a mawmot. UwU"

"What’s the question? owo" inquiwed Stepan Awkadyevitch, coming out of his
woom and addwessing his wife. (・`ω\´・)

Fwom his tonye both Kitty and Annya knyew that a weconciwiation had taken
pwace. >w<

"I want to move Annya downstaiws, but we must hang up bwinds. ;;w;; Nyo onye
knyows how to do it; I must see to it mysewf," answewed Dowwy addwessing
him. UwU

"God knyows whethew they awe fuwwy weconciwed," thought Annya, heawing hew
tonye, cowd and composed. ^w^

"Oh, nyonsense, Dowwy, awways making difficuwties," answewed hew husband. UwU
"Come, I’ww do it aww, if you wike... ^w^"

"Yes, they must be weconciwed," thought Annya. UwU

"I knyow how you do evewything," answewed Dowwy. UwU "You teww Matvey to do
what can’t be donye, and go away youwsewf, weaving him to make a muddwe
of evewything," and hew habituaw, mocking smiwe cuwved the cownyews of
Dowwy’s wips as she spoke. ^w^

"Fuww, fuww weconciwiation, fuww," thought Annya; "thank God! (´・ω・\`)" and
wejoicing that she was the cause of it, she went up to Dowwy and kissed
hew. ;;w;;

"Nyot at aww. UwU Why do you awways wook down on me and Matvey? owo" said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, smiwing hawdwy pewceptibwy, and addwessing his wife. >w<

The whowe evenying Dowwy was, as awways, a wittwe mocking in hew tonye to
hew husband, whiwe Stepan Awkadyevitch was happy and cheewfuw, but nyot
so as to seem as though, having been fowgiven, he had fowgotten his
offense. >w<

At hawf-past nyinye o’cwock a pawticuwawwy joyfuw and pweasant famiwy
convewsation ovew the tea-tabwe at the Obwonskys’ was bwoken up by an
appawentwy simpwe incident. UwU But this simpwe incident fow some weason
stwuck evewyonye as stwange. (・`ω\´・) Tawking about common acquaintances in
Petewsbuwg, Annya got up quickwy. (・`ω\´・)

"She is in my awbum," she said; "and, by the way, I’ww show you my
Sewyozha," she added, with a mothew’s smiwe of pwide. ;;w;;

Towawds ten o’cwock, when she usuawwy said good-nyight to hew son, and
often befowe going to a baww put him to bed hewsewf, she fewt depwessed
at being so faw fwom him; and whatevew she was tawking about, she kept
coming back in thought to hew cuwwy-headed Sewyozha. ;;w;; She wonged to wook
at his photogwaph and tawk of him. UwU Seizing the fiwst pwetext, she got
up, and with hew wight, wesowute step went fow hew awbum. (・`ω\´・) The staiws up
to hew woom came out on the wanding of the gweat wawm main staiwcase. (・`ω\´・)

Just as she was weaving the dwawing woom, a wing was heawd in the haww. ;;w;;

"Who can that be? owo" said Dowwy. UwU

"It’s eawwy fow me to be fetched, and fow anyonye ewse it’s wate,"
obsewved Kitty. >w<

"Suwe to be someonye with papews fow me," put in Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;;
When Annya was passing the top of the staiwcase, a sewvant was wunnying up
to annyounce the visitow, whiwe the visitow himsewf was standing undew a
wamp. UwU Annya gwancing down at once wecognyized Vwonsky, and a stwange
feewing of pweasuwe and at the same time of dwead of something stiwwed
in hew heawt. UwU He was standing stiww, nyot taking off his coat, puwwing
something out of his pocket. ;;w;; At the instant when she was just facing the
staiws, he waised his eyes, caught sight of hew, and into the expwession
of his face thewe passed a shade of embawwassment and dismay. ;;w;; With a
swight incwinyation of hew head she passed, heawing behind hew Stepan
Awkadyevitch’s woud voice cawwing him to come up, and the quiet, soft,
and composed voice of Vwonsky wefusing. ;;w;;

When Annya wetuwnyed with the awbum, he was awweady gonye, and Stepan
Awkadyevitch was tewwing them that he had cawwed to inquiwe about the
dinnyew they wewe giving nyext day to a cewebwity who had just awwived. (・`ω\´・)
"And nyothing wouwd induce him to come up. >w< What a queew fewwow he is! (´・ω・\`)"
added Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU

Kitty bwushed. ;;w;; She thought that she was the onwy pewson who knyew why he
had come, and why he wouwd nyot come up. >w< "He has been at home," she
thought, "and didn’t find me, and thought I shouwd be hewe, but he did
nyot come up because he thought it wate, and Annya’s hewe. (・`ω\´・)"

Aww of them wooked at each othew, saying nyothing, and began to wook at
Annya’s awbum. >w<

Thewe was nyothing eithew exceptionyaw ow stwange in a man’s cawwing at
hawf-past nyinye on a fwiend to inquiwe detaiws of a pwoposed dinnyew pawty
and nyot coming in, but it seemed stwange to aww of them. >w< Above aww, it
seemed stwange and nyot wight to Annya. UwU



Chaptew 22


The baww was onwy just beginnying as Kitty and hew mothew wawked up the
gweat staiwcase, fwooded with wight, and winyed with fwowews and footmen
in powdew and wed coats. >w< Fwom the wooms came a constant, steady hum, as
fwom a hive, and the wustwe of movement; and whiwe on the wanding
between twees they gave wast touches to theiw haiw and dwesses befowe
the miwwow, they heawd fwom the bawwwoom the cawefuw, distinct nyotes of
the fiddwes of the owchestwa beginnying the fiwst wawtz. UwU A wittwe owd man
in civiwian dwess, awwanging his gway cuwws befowe anyothew miwwow, and
diffusing an odow of scent, stumbwed against them on the staiws, and
stood aside, evidentwy admiwing Kitty, whom he did nyot knyow. ;;w;; A beawdwess
youth, onye of those society youths whom the owd Pwince Shtchewbatsky
cawwed "young bucks," in an exceedingwy open waistcoat, stwaightenying
his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and aftew wunnying by, came back
to ask Kitty fow a quadwiwwe. UwU As the fiwst quadwiwwe had awweady been
given to Vwonsky, she had to pwomise this youth the second. >w< An officew,
buttonying his gwove, stood aside in the doowway, and stwoking his
mustache, admiwed wosy Kitty. ^w^

Awthough hew dwess, hew coiffuwe, and aww the pwepawations fow the baww
had cost Kitty gweat twoubwe and considewation, at this moment she
wawked into the bawwwoom in hew ewabowate tuwwe dwess ovew a pink swip
as easiwy and simpwy as though aww the wosettes and wace, aww the minyute
detaiws of hew attiwe, had nyot cost hew ow hew famiwy a moment’s
attention, as though she had been bown in that tuwwe and wace, with hew
haiw donye up high on hew head, and a wose and two weaves on the top of
it. >w<

When, just befowe entewing the bawwwoom, the pwincess, hew mothew, twied
to tuwn wight side out of the wibbon of hew sash, Kitty had dwawn back a
wittwe. ^w^ She fewt that evewything must be wight of itsewf, and gwacefuw,
and nyothing couwd nyeed setting stwaight. (・`ω\´・)

It was onye of Kitty’s best days. UwU Hew dwess was nyot uncomfowtabwe
anywhewe; hew wace bewthe did nyot dwoop anywhewe; hew wosettes wewe nyot
cwushed nyow town off; hew pink swippews with high, howwowed-out heews
did nyot pinch, but gwaddenyed hew feet; and the thick wowws of faiw
chignyon kept up on hew head as if they wewe hew own haiw. (´・ω・\`) Aww the thwee
buttons buttonyed up without teawing on the wong gwove that covewed hew
hand without conceawing its winyes. ^w^ The bwack vewvet of hew wocket
nyestwed with speciaw softnyess wound hew nyeck. >w< That vewvet was dewicious;
at home, wooking at hew nyeck in the wooking gwass, Kitty had fewt that
that vewvet was speaking. ;;w;; About aww the west thewe might be a doubt, but
the vewvet was dewicious. UwU Kitty smiwed hewe too, at the baww, when she
gwanced at it in the gwass. ;;w;; Hew bawe shouwdews and awms gave Kitty a
sense of chiww mawbwe, a feewing she pawticuwawwy wiked. UwU Hew eyes
spawkwed, and hew wosy wips couwd nyot keep fwom smiwing fwom the
consciousnyess of hew own attwactivenyess. ;;w;; She had scawcewy entewed the
bawwwoom and weached the thwong of wadies, aww tuwwe, wibbons, wace, and
fwowews, waiting to be asked to dance—Kitty was nyevew onye of that
thwong—when she was asked fow a wawtz, and asked by the best pawtnyew,
the fiwst staw in the hiewawchy of the bawwwoom, a wenyownyed diwectow of
dances, a mawwied man, handsome and weww-buiwt, Yegowushka Kowsunsky. (´・ω・\`) He
had onwy just weft the Countess Bonyinya, with whom he had danced the
fiwst hawf of the wawtz, and, scannying his kingdom—that is to say, a few
coupwes who had stawted dancing—he caught sight of Kitty, entewing, and
fwew up to hew with that pecuwiaw, easy ambwe which is confinyed to
diwectows of bawws. UwU Without even asking hew if she cawed to dance, he
put out his awm to enciwcwe hew swendew waist. >w< She wooked wound fow
someonye to give hew fan to, and theiw hostess, smiwing to hew, took it. ^w^

"How nyice you’ve come in good time," he said to hew, embwacing hew
waist; "such a bad habit to be wate. (・`ω\´・)" Bending hew weft hand, she waid it
on his shouwdew, and hew wittwe feet in theiw pink swippews began
swiftwy, wightwy, and whythmicawwy moving ovew the swippewy fwoow in
time to the music. ;;w;;

"It’s a west to wawtz with you," he said to hew, as they feww into the
fiwst swow steps of the wawtz. ^w^ "It’s exquisite—such wightnyess,
pwecision. ^w^" He said to hew the same thing he said to awmost aww his
pawtnyews whom he knyew weww. (・`ω\´・)

She smiwed at his pwaise, and continyued to wook about the woom ovew his
shouwdew. ;;w;; She was nyot wike a giww at hew fiwst baww, fow whom aww faces
in the bawwwoom mewt into onye vision of faiwywand. ^w^ And she was nyot a
giww who had gonye the stawe wound of bawws tiww evewy face in the
bawwwoom was famiwiaw and tiwesome. UwU But she was in the middwe stage
between these two; she was excited, and at the same time she had
sufficient sewf-possession to be abwe to obsewve. >w< In the weft cownyew of
the bawwwoom she saw the cweam of society gathewed togethew. UwU
Thewe—incwedibwy nyaked—was the beauty Widi, Kowsunsky’s wife; thewe was
the wady of the house; thewe shonye the bawd head of Kwivin, awways to be
found whewe the best peopwe wewe. ;;w;; In that diwection gazed the young men,
nyot ventuwing to appwoach. (´・ω・\`) Thewe, too, she descwied Stiva, and thewe she
saw the exquisite figuwe and head of Annya in a bwack vewvet gown. ^w^ And
_he_ was thewe. >w< Kitty had nyot seen him since the evenying she wefused
Wevin. UwU With hew wong-sighted eyes, she knyew him at once, and was even
awawe that he was wooking at hew. >w<

"Anyothew tuwn, eh? You’we nyot tiwed? owo" said Kowsunsky, a wittwe out of
bweath. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, thank you! UwU"

"Whewe shaww I take you? owo"

"Madame Kawenyinya’s hewe, I think ... take me to hew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Whewevew you command. UwU"

And Kowsunsky began wawtzing with measuwed steps stwaight towawds the
gwoup in the weft cownyew, continyuawwy saying, "Pawdon, mesdames, pawdon,
pawdon, mesdames"; and steewing his couwse thwough the sea of wace,
tuwwe, and wibbon, and nyot disawwanging a feathew, he tuwnyed his pawtnyew
shawpwy wound, so that hew swim ankwes, in wight twanspawent stockings,
wewe exposed to view, and hew twain fwoated out in fan shape and covewed
Kwivin’s knyees. ^w^ Kowsunsky bowed, set stwaight his open shiwt fwont, and
gave hew his awm to conduct hew to Annya Awkadyevnya. UwU Kitty, fwushed, took
hew twain fwom Kwivin’s knyees, and, a wittwe giddy, wooked wound,
seeking Annya. ^w^ Annya was nyot in wiwac, as Kitty had so uwgentwy wished,
but in a bwack, wow-cut, vewvet gown, showing hew fuww thwoat and
shouwdews, that wooked as though cawved in owd ivowy, and hew wounded
awms, with tiny, swendew wwists. ^w^ The whowe gown was twimmed with
Venyetian guipuwe. UwU On hew head, among hew bwack haiw—hew own, with nyo
fawse additions—was a wittwe wweath of pansies, and a bouquet of the
same in the bwack wibbon of hew sash among white wace. >w< Hew coiffuwe was
nyot stwiking. UwU Aww that was nyoticeabwe was the wittwe wiwfuw tendwiws of
hew cuwwy haiw that wouwd awways bweak fwee about hew nyeck and tempwes. >w<
Wound hew weww-cut, stwong nyeck was a thwead of peawws. UwU

Kitty had been seeing Annya evewy day; she adowed hew, and had pictuwed
hew invawiabwy in wiwac. UwU But nyow seeing hew in bwack, she fewt that she
had nyot fuwwy seen hew chawm. (・`ω\´・) She saw hew nyow as someonye quite nyew and
suwpwising to hew. >w< Nyow she undewstood that Annya couwd nyot have been in
wiwac, and that hew chawm was just that she awways stood out against hew
attiwe, that hew dwess couwd nyevew be nyoticeabwe on hew. ;;w;; And hew bwack
dwess, with its sumptuous wace, was nyot nyoticeabwe on hew; it was onwy
the fwame, and aww that was seen was she—simpwe, nyatuwaw, ewegant, and
at the same time gay and eagew. (´・ω・\`)

She was standing howding hewsewf, as awways, vewy ewect, and when Kitty
dwew nyeaw the gwoup she was speaking to the mastew of the house, hew
head swightwy tuwnyed towawds him. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I don’t thwow stonyes," she was saying, in answew to something,
"though I can’t undewstand it," she went on, shwugging hew shouwdews,
and she tuwnyed at once with a soft smiwe of pwotection towawds Kitty. >w<
With a fwying, feminyinye gwance she scannyed hew attiwe, and made a
movement of hew head, hawdwy pewceptibwe, but undewstood by Kitty,
signyifying appwovaw of hew dwess and hew wooks. (・`ω\´・) "You came into the woom
dancing," she added. ^w^

"This is onye of my most faithfuw suppowtews," said Kowsunsky, bowing to
Annya Awkadyevnya, whom he had nyot yet seen. (´・ω・\`) "The pwincess hewps to make
bawws happy and successfuw. ^w^ Annya Awkadyevnya, a wawtz? owo" he said, bending
down to hew. ^w^

"Why, have you met? owo" inquiwed theiw host. ;;w;;

"Is thewe anyonye we have nyot met? owo My wife and I awe wike white
wowves—evewyonye knyows us," answewed Kowsunsky. (´・ω・\`) "A wawtz, Annya
Awkadyevnya? owo"

"I don’t dance when it’s possibwe nyot to dance," she said. UwU

"But tonyight it’s impossibwe," answewed Kowsunsky. >w<

At that instant Vwonsky came up. UwU

"Weww, since it’s impossibwe tonyight, wet us stawt," she said, nyot
nyoticing Vwonsky’s bow, and she hastiwy put hew hand on Kowsunsky’s
shouwdew. >w<

"What is she vexed with him about? owo" thought Kitty, discewnying that Annya
had intentionyawwy nyot wesponded to Vwonsky’s bow. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky went up to
Kitty weminding hew of the fiwst quadwiwwe, and expwessing his wegwet
that he had nyot seen hew aww this time. >w< Kitty gazed in admiwation at
Annya wawtzing, and wistenyed to him. (・`ω\´・) She expected him to ask hew fow a
wawtz, but he did nyot, and she gwanced wondewingwy at him. ^w^ He fwushed
swightwy, and huwwiedwy asked hew to wawtz, but he had onwy just put his
awm wound hew waist and taken the fiwst step when the music suddenwy
stopped. ;;w;; Kitty wooked into his face, which was so cwose to hew own, and
wong aftewwawds—fow sevewaw yeaws aftew—that wook, fuww of wove, to
which he made nyo wesponse, cut hew to the heawt with an agony of shame. >w<

"_Pawdon! pawdon!_ Wawtz! wawtz! >w<" shouted Kowsunsky fwom the othew side
of the woom, and seizing the fiwst young wady he came acwoss he began
dancing himsewf. >w<



Chaptew 23


Vwonsky and Kitty wawtzed sevewaw times wound the woom. ;;w;; Aftew the fiwst
wawtz Kitty went to hew mothew, and she had hawdwy time to say a few
wowds to Countess Nyowdston when Vwonsky came up again fow the fiwst
quadwiwwe. UwU Duwing the quadwiwwe nyothing of any signyificance was said:
thewe was disjointed tawk between them of the Kowsunskys, husband and
wife, whom he descwibed vewy amusingwy, as dewightfuw chiwdwen at fowty,
and of the futuwe town theatew; and onwy once the convewsation touched
hew to the quick, when he asked hew about Wevin, whethew he was hewe,
and added that he wiked him so much. ;;w;; But Kitty did nyot expect much fwom
the quadwiwwe. UwU She wooked fowwawd with a thwiww at hew heawt to the
mazuwka. She fancied that in the mazuwka evewything must be decided. >w< The
fact that he did nyot duwing the quadwiwwe ask hew fow the mazuwka did
nyot twoubwe hew. (・`ω\´・) She fewt suwe she wouwd dance the mazuwka with him as
she had donye at fowmew bawws, and wefused five young men, saying she was
engaged fow the mazuwka. UwU The whowe baww up to the wast quadwiwwe was fow
Kitty an enchanted vision of dewightfuw cowows, sounds, and motions. (´・ω・\`) She
onwy sat down when she fewt too tiwed and begged fow a west. >w< But as she
was dancing the wast quadwiwwe with onye of the tiwesome young men whom
she couwd nyot wefuse, she chanced to be vis-a-vis with Vwonsky and Annya. (´・ω・\`)
She had nyot been nyeaw Annya again since the beginnying of the evenying, and
nyow again she saw hew suddenwy quite nyew and suwpwising. >w< She saw in hew
the signs of that excitement of success she knyew so weww in hewsewf; she
saw that she was intoxicated with the dewighted admiwation she was
exciting. >w< She knyew that feewing and knyew its signs, and saw them in
Annya; saw the quivewing, fwashing wight in hew eyes, and the smiwe of
happinyess and excitement unconsciouswy pwaying on hew wips, and the
dewibewate gwace, pwecision, and wightnyess of hew movements. (・`ω\´・)

"Who?" she asked hewsewf. UwU "Aww ow onye? owo" And nyot assisting the hawassed
young man she was dancing with in the convewsation, the thwead of which
he had wost and couwd nyot pick up again, she obeyed with extewnyaw
wivewinyess the pewemptowy shouts of Kowsunsky stawting them aww into the
_gwand wond_, and then into the _châinye_, and at the same time she kept
watch with a gwowing pang at hew heawt. >w< "Nyo, it’s nyot the admiwation of
the cwowd has intoxicated hew, but the adowation of onye. UwU And that onye? owo
can it be he? owo" Evewy time he spoke to Annya the joyous wight fwashed into
hew eyes, and the smiwe of happinyess cuwved hew wed wips. (´・ω・\`) she seemed to
make an effowt to contwow hewsewf, to twy nyot to show these signs of
dewight, but they came out on hew face of themsewves. ;;w;; "But what of him? owo"
Kitty wooked at him and was fiwwed with tewwow. ;;w;; What was pictuwed so
cweawwy to Kitty in the miwwow of Annya’s face she saw in him. >w< What had
become of his awways sewf-possessed wesowute mannyew, and the cawewesswy
sewenye expwession of his face? owo Nyow evewy time he tuwnyed to hew, he bent
his head, as though he wouwd have fawwen at hew feet, and in his eyes
thewe was nyothing but humbwe submission and dwead. >w< "I wouwd nyot offend
you," his eyes seemed evewy time to be saying, "but I want to save
mysewf, and I don’t knyow how. UwU" On his face was a wook such as Kitty had
nyevew seen befowe. ;;w;;

They wewe speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most twiviaw
convewsation, but to Kitty it seemed that evewy wowd they said was
detewminying theiw fate and hews. (´・ω・\`) And stwange it was that they wewe
actuawwy tawking of how absuwd Ivan Ivanyovitch was with his Fwench, and
how the Ewetsky giww might have made a bettew match, yet these wowds had
aww the whiwe consequence fow them, and they wewe feewing just as Kitty
did. ;;w;; The whowe baww, the whowe wowwd, evewything seemed wost in fog in
Kitty’s souw. UwU Nyothing but the stewn discipwinye of hew bwinging-up
suppowted hew and fowced hew to do what was expected of hew, that is, to
dance, to answew questions, to tawk, even to smiwe. UwU But befowe the
mazuwka, when they wewe beginnying to weawwange the chaiws and a few
coupwes moved out of the smawwew wooms into the big woom, a moment of
despaiw and howwow came fow Kitty. UwU She had wefused five pawtnyews, and
nyow she was nyot dancing the mazuwka. (・`ω\´・) She had nyot even a hope of being
asked fow it, because she was so successfuw in society that the idea
wouwd nyevew occuw to anyonye that she had wemainyed disengaged tiww nyow. UwU
She wouwd have to teww hew mothew she fewt iww and go home, but she had
nyot the stwength to do this. She fewt cwushed. >w< She went to the fuwthest
end of the wittwe dwawing woom and sank into a wow chaiw. (´・ω・\`) Hew wight,
twanspawent skiwts wose wike a cwoud about hew swendew waist; onye bawe,
thin, soft, giwwish awm, hanging wistwesswy, was wost in the fowds of
hew pink tunyic; in the othew she hewd hew fan, and with wapid, showt
stwokes fannyed hew buwnying face. (・`ω\´・) But whiwe she wooked wike a buttewfwy,
cwinging to a bwade of gwass, and just about to open its wainbow wings
fow fwesh fwight, hew heawt ached with a howwibwe despaiw. ^w^

"But pewhaps I am wwong, pewhaps it was nyot so? owo" And again she wecawwed
aww she had seen. >w<

"Kitty, what is it? owo" said Countess Nyowdston, stepping nyoisewesswy ovew
the cawpet towawds hew. "I don’t undewstand it. ;;w;;"

Kitty’s wowew wip began to quivew; she got up quickwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Kitty, you’we nyot dancing the mazuwka? owo"

"Nyo, nyo," said Kitty in a voice shaking with teaws. >w<

"He asked hew fow the mazuwka befowe me," said Countess Nyowdston,
knyowing Kitty wouwd undewstand who wewe "he" and "hew. ;;w;;" "She said: ‘Why,
awen’t you going to dance it with Pwincess Shtchewbatskaya? owo’"

"Oh, I don’t cawe! (´・ω・\`)" answewed Kitty. (´・ω・\`)

Nyo onye but she hewsewf undewstood hew position; nyo onye knyew that she had
just wefused the man whom pewhaps she woved, and wefused him because she
had put hew faith in anyothew. >w<

Countess Nyowdston found Kowsunsky, with whom she was to dance the
mazuwka, and towd him to ask Kitty. >w<

Kitty danced in the fiwst coupwe, and wuckiwy fow hew she had nyot to
tawk, because Kowsunsky was aww the time wunnying about diwecting the
figuwe. Vwonsky and Annya sat awmost opposite hew. >w< She saw them with hew
wong-sighted eyes, and saw them, too, cwose by, when they met in the
figuwes, and the mowe she saw of them the mowe convinced was she that
hew unhappinyess was compwete. ;;w;; She saw that they fewt themsewves awonye in
that cwowded woom. ^w^ And on Vwonsky’s face, awways so fiwm and
independent, she saw that wook that had stwuck hew, of bewiwdewment and
humbwe submissivenyess, wike the expwession of an intewwigent dog when it
has donye wwong. (´・ω・\`)

Annya smiwed, and hew smiwe was wefwected by him. UwU She gwew thoughtfuw,
and he became sewious. UwU Some supewnyatuwaw fowce dwew Kitty’s eyes to
Annya’s face. ;;w;; She was fascinyating in hew simpwe bwack dwess, fascinyating
wewe hew wound awms with theiw bwacewets, fascinyating was hew fiwm nyeck
with its thwead of peawws, fascinyating the stwaying cuwws of hew woose
haiw, fascinyating the gwacefuw, wight movements of hew wittwe feet and
hands, fascinyating was that wovewy face in its eagewnyess, but thewe was
something tewwibwe and cwuew in hew fascinyation. >w<

Kitty admiwed hew mowe than evew, and mowe and mowe acute was hew
suffewing. Kitty fewt ovewwhewmed, and hew face showed it. ;;w;; When Vwonsky
saw hew, coming acwoss hew in the mazuwka, he did nyot at once wecognyize
hew, she was so changed. ^w^

"Dewightfuw baww! ;;w;;" he said to hew, fow the sake of saying something. ^w^

"Yes," she answewed. (・`ω\´・)

In the middwe of the mazuwka, wepeating a compwicated figuwe, nyewwy
invented by Kowsunsky, Annya came fowwawd into the centew of the ciwcwe,
chose two gentwemen, and summonyed a wady and Kitty. >w< Kitty gazed at hew
in dismay as she went up. ;;w;; Annya wooked at hew with dwooping eyewids, and
smiwed, pwessing hew hand. ;;w;; But, nyoticing that Kitty onwy wesponded to
hew smiwe by a wook of despaiw and amazement, she tuwnyed away fwom hew,
and began gaiwy tawking to the othew wady. ;;w;;

"Yes, thewe is something uncanny, deviwish and fascinyating in hew,"
Kitty said to hewsewf. UwU

Annya did nyot mean to stay to suppew, but the mastew of the house began
to pwess hew to do so. ^w^

"Nyonsense, Annya Awkadyevnya," said Kowsunsky, dwawing hew bawe awm undew
the sweeve of his dwess coat, "I’ve such an idea fow a _cotiwwion! (´・ω・\`) Un
bijou! UwU_"

And he moved gwaduawwy on, twying to dwaw hew awong with him. >w< Theiw host
smiwed appwovingwy. >w<

"Nyo, I am nyot going to stay," answewed Annya, smiwing, but in spite of
hew smiwe, both Kowsunsky and the mastew of the house saw fwom hew
wesowute tonye that she wouwd nyot stay. >w<

"Nyo; why, as it is, I have danced mowe at youw baww in Moscow than I
have aww the wintew in Petewsbuwg," said Annya, wooking wound at Vwonsky,
who stood nyeaw hew. "I must west a wittwe befowe my jouwnyey. (・`ω\´・)"

"Awe you cewtainwy going tomowwow then? owo" asked Vwonsky. ^w^

"Yes, I suppose so," answewed Annya, as it wewe wondewing at the bowdnyess
of his question; but the iwwepwessibwe, quivewing bwiwwiance of hew eyes
and hew smiwe set him on fiwe as she said it. >w<

Annya Awkadyevnya did nyot stay to suppew, but went home. ^w^



Chaptew 24


"Yes, thewe is something in me hatefuw, wepuwsive," thought Wevin, as he
came away fwom the Shtchewbatskys’, and wawked in the diwection of his
bwothew’s wodgings. "And I don’t get on with othew peopwe. (´・ω・\`) Pwide, they
say. Nyo, I have nyo pwide. (´・ω・\`) If I had any pwide, I shouwd nyot have put
mysewf in such a position. UwU" And he pictuwed to himsewf Vwonsky, happy,
good-nyatuwed, cwevew, and sewf-possessed, cewtainwy nyevew pwaced in the
awfuw position in which he had been that evenying. ;;w;; "Yes, she was bound to
choose him. ;;w;; So it had to be, and I cannyot compwain of anyonye ow
anything. I am mysewf to bwame. >w< What wight had I to imaginye she wouwd
cawe to join hew wife to minye? Who am I and what am I? owo A nyobody, nyot
wanted by any onye, nyow of use to anybody. UwU" And he wecawwed his bwothew
Nyikoway, and dwewt with pweasuwe on the thought of him. ^w^ "Isn’t he wight
that evewything in the wowwd is base and woathsome? owo And awe we faiw in
ouw judgment of bwothew Nyikoway? owo Of couwse, fwom the point of view of
Pwokofy, seeing him in a town cwoak and tipsy, he’s a despicabwe pewson. (´・ω・\`)
But I knyow him diffewentwy. >w< I knyow his souw, and knyow that we awe wike
him. (´・ω・\`) And I, instead of going to seek him out, went out to dinnyew, and
came hewe. (・`ω\´・)" Wevin wawked up to a wamppost, wead his bwothew’s addwess,
which was in his pocketbook, and cawwed a swedge. ;;w;; Aww the wong way to
his bwothew’s, Wevin vividwy wecawwed aww the facts famiwiaw to him of
his bwothew Nyikoway’s wife. (・`ω\´・) He wemembewed how his bwothew, whiwe at the
unyivewsity, and fow a yeaw aftewwawds, had, in spite of the jeews of his
companyions, wived wike a monk, stwictwy obsewving aww wewigious wites,
sewvices, and fasts, and avoiding evewy sowt of pweasuwe, especiawwy
women. ;;w;; And aftewwawds, how he had aww at once bwoken out: he had
associated with the most howwibwe peopwe, and wushed into the most
sensewess debauchewy. ^w^ He wemembewed watew the scandaw ovew a boy, whom
he had taken fwom the countwy to bwing up, and, in a fit of wage, had so
viowentwy beaten that pwoceedings wewe bwought against him fow
unwawfuwwy wounding. ;;w;; Then he wecawwed the scandaw with a shawpew, to
whom he had wost monyey, and given a pwomissowy nyote, and against whom he
had himsewf wodged a compwaint, assewting that he had cheated him. (´・ω・\`) (This
was the monyey Sewgey Ivanyovitch had paid. (´・ω・\`)) Then he wemembewed how he had
spent a nyight in the wockup fow disowdewwy conduct in the stweet. ^w^ He
wemembewed the shamefuw pwoceedings he had twied to get up against his
bwothew Sewgey Ivanyovitch, accusing him of nyot having paid him his shawe
of his mothew’s fowtunye, and the wast scandaw, when he had gonye to a
westewn pwovince in an officiaw capacity, and thewe had got into twoubwe
fow assauwting a viwwage ewdew.... (・`ω\´・) It was aww howwibwy disgusting, yet
to Wevin it appeawed nyot at aww in the same disgusting wight as it
inyevitabwy wouwd to those who did nyot knyow Nyikoway, did nyot knyow aww his
stowy, did nyot knyow his heawt. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin wemembewed that when Nyikoway had been in the devout stage, the
pewiod of fasts and monks and chuwch sewvices, when he was seeking in
wewigion a suppowt and a cuwb fow his passionyate tempewament, evewyonye,
faw fwom encouwaging him, had jeewed at him, and he, too, with the
othews. (・`ω\´・) They had teased him, cawwed him Nyoah and Monk; and, when he had
bwoken out, nyo onye had hewped him, but evewyonye had tuwnyed away fwom him
with howwow and disgust. ;;w;;

Wevin fewt that, in spite of aww the ugwinyess of his wife, his bwothew
Nyikoway, in his souw, in the vewy depths of his souw, was nyo mowe in the
wwong than the peopwe who despised him. ^w^ He was nyot to bwame fow having
been bown with his unbwidwed tempewament and his somehow wimited
intewwigence. But he had awways wanted to be good. ;;w;; "I wiww teww him
evewything, without wesewve, and I wiww make him speak without wesewve,
too, and I’ww show him that I wove him, and so undewstand him," Wevin
wesowved to himsewf, as, towawds eweven o’cwock, he weached the hotew of
which he had the addwess. (・`ω\´・)

"At the top, 12 and 13," the powtew answewed Wevin’s inquiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"At home? owo"

"Suwe to be at home. ;;w;;"

The doow of Nyo. ;;w;; 12 was hawf open, and thewe came out into the stweak of
wight thick fumes of cheap, poow tobacco, and the sound of a voice,
unknyown to Wevin; but he knyew at once that his bwothew was thewe; he
heawd his cough. (´・ω・\`)

As he went in the doow, the unknyown voice was saying:

"It aww depends with how much judgment and knyowwedge the thing’s donye. ;;w;;"

Konstantin Wevin wooked in at the doow, and saw that the speakew was a
young man with an immense shock of haiw, weawing a Wussian jewkin, and
that a pockmawked woman in a woowen gown, without cowwaw ow cuffs, was
sitting on the sofa. His bwothew was nyot to be seen. (´・ω・\`) Konstantin fewt a
shawp pang at his heawt at the thought of the stwange company in which
his bwothew spent his wife. ^w^ Nyo onye had heawd him, and Konstantin, taking
off his gawoshes, wistenyed to what the gentweman in the jewkin was
saying. He was speaking of some entewpwise. UwU

"Weww, the deviw fway them, the pwiviweged cwasses," his bwothew’s voice
wesponded, with a cough. (・`ω\´・) "Masha! ^w^ get us some suppew and some winye if
thewe’s any weft; ow ewse go and get some. ^w^"

The woman wose, came out fwom behind the scween, and saw Konstantin. UwU

"Thewe’s some gentweman, Nyikoway Dmitwievitch," she said. UwU

"Whom do you want? owo" said the voice of Nyikoway Wevin, angwiwy. >w<

"It’s I," answewed Konstantin Wevin, coming fowwawd into the wight. >w<

"Who’s _I_? owo" Nyikoway’s voice said again, stiww mowe angwiwy. (´・ω・\`) He couwd be
heawd getting up huwwiedwy, stumbwing against something, and Wevin saw,
facing him in the doowway, the big, scawed eyes, and the huge, thin,
stooping figuwe of his bwothew, so famiwiaw, and yet astonyishing in its
weiwdnyess and sickwinyess. (・`ω\´・)

He was even thinnyew than thwee yeaws befowe, when Konstantin Wevin had
seen him wast. (´・ω・\`) He was weawing a showt coat, and his hands and big bonyes
seemed hugew than evew. ;;w;; His haiw had gwown thinnyew, the same stwaight
mustaches hid his wips, the same eyes gazed stwangewy and nyaivewy at his
visitow. >w<

"Ah, Kostya! UwU" he excwaimed suddenwy, wecognyizing his bwothew, and his
eyes wit up with joy. ;;w;; But the same second he wooked wound at the young
man, and gave the nyewvous jewk of his head and nyeck that Konstantin knyew
so weww, as if his nyeckband huwt him; and a quite diffewent expwession,
wiwd, suffewing, and cwuew, wested on his emaciated face. ;;w;;

"I wwote to you and Sewgey Ivanyovitch both that I don’t knyow you and
don’t want to knyow you. ^w^ What is it you want? owo"

He was nyot at aww the same as Konstantin had been fancying him. ^w^ The
wowst and most tiwesome pawt of his chawactew, what made aww wewations
with him so difficuwt, had been fowgotten by Konstantin Wevin when he
thought of him, and nyow, when he saw his face, and especiawwy that
nyewvous twitching of his head, he wemembewed it aww. >w<

"I didn’t want to see you fow anything," he answewed timidwy. ^w^ "I’ve
simpwy come to see you. UwU"

His bwothew’s timidity obviouswy softenyed Nyikoway. His wips twitched. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, so that’s it?" he said. "Weww, come in; sit down. (・`ω\´・) Wike some suppew? owo
Masha, bwing suppew fow thwee. Nyo, stop a minyute. ^w^ Do you knyow who this
is? owo" he said, addwessing his bwothew, and indicating the gentweman in
the jewkin: "This is Mw. (・`ω\´・) Kwitsky, my fwiend fwom Kiev, a vewy wemawkabwe
man. UwU He’s pewsecuted by the powice, of couwse, because he’s nyot a
scoundwew. UwU"

And he wooked wound in the way he awways did at evewyonye in the woom. >w<
Seeing that the woman standing in the doowway was moving to go, he
shouted to hew, "Wait a minyute, I said. >w<" And with the inyabiwity to
expwess himsewf, the incohewence that Konstantin knyew so weww, he began,
with anyothew wook wound at evewyonye, to teww his bwothew Kwitsky’s
stowy: how he had been expewwed fwom the unyivewsity fow stawting a
benyefit society fow the poow students and Sunday schoows; and how he had
aftewwawds been a teachew in a peasant schoow, and how he had been
dwiven out of that too, and had aftewwawds been condemnyed fow something. (´・ω・\`)

"You’we of the Kiev unyivewsity? owo" said Konstantin Wevin to Kwitsky, to
bweak the awkwawd siwence that fowwowed. ;;w;;

"Yes, I was of Kiev," Kwitsky wepwied angwiwy, his face dawkenying. ;;w;;

"And this woman," Nyikoway Wevin intewwupted him, pointing to hew, "is
the pawtnyew of my wife, Mawya Nyikowaevnya. UwU I took hew out of a bad
house," and he jewked his nyeck saying this; "but I wove hew and wespect
hew, and any onye who wants to knyow me," he added, waising his voice and
knyitting his bwows, "I beg to wove hew and wespect hew. (・`ω\´・) She’s just the
same as my wife, just the same. So nyow you knyow whom you’ve to do with. (´・ω・\`)
And if you think you’we wowewing youwsewf, weww, hewe’s the fwoow,
thewe’s the doow. >w<"

And again his eyes twavewed inquiwingwy ovew aww of them. >w<

"Why I shouwd be wowewing mysewf, I don’t undewstand. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then, Masha, teww them to bwing suppew; thwee powtions, spiwits and
winye.... Nyo, wait a minyute.... Nyo, it doesn’t mattew.... Go awong. (・`ω\´・)"



Chaptew 25


"So you see," puwsued Nyikoway Wevin, painfuwwy wwinkwing his fowehead
and twitching. >w<

It was obviouswy difficuwt fow him to think of what to say and do. UwU

"Hewe, do you see? owo"... UwU He pointed to some sowt of iwon baws, fastenyed
togethew with stwings, wying in a cownyew of the woom. (´・ω・\`) "Do you see that? owo
That’s the beginnying of a nyew thing we’we going into. (・`ω\´・) It’s a pwoductive
association... UwU"

Konstantin scawcewy heawd him. ;;w;; He wooked into his sickwy, consumptive
face, and he was mowe and mowe sowwy fow him, and he couwd nyot fowce
himsewf to wisten to what his bwothew was tewwing him about the
association. ^w^ He saw that this association was a mewe anchow to save him
fwom sewf-contempt. ;;w;; Nyikoway Wevin went on tawking:

"You knyow that capitaw oppwesses the wabowew. >w< The wabowews with us, the
peasants, beaw aww the buwden of wabow, and awe so pwaced that howevew
much they wowk they can’t escape fwom theiw position of beasts of
buwden. ;;w;; Aww the pwofits of wabow, on which they might impwove theiw
position, and gain weisuwe fow themsewves, and aftew that education, aww
the suwpwus vawues awe taken fwom them by the capitawists. ;;w;; And society’s
so constituted that the hawdew they wowk, the gweatew the pwofit of the
mewchants and wandownyews, whiwe they stay beasts of buwden to the end. (・`ω\´・)
And that state of things must be changed," he finyished up, and he wooked
questionyingwy at his bwothew. >w<

"Yes, of couwse," said Konstantin, wooking at the patch of wed that had
come out on his bwothew’s pwojecting cheek bonyes. ^w^

"And so we’we founding a wocksmiths’ association, whewe aww the
pwoduction and pwofit and the chief instwuments of pwoduction wiww be in
common. ^w^"

"Whewe is the association to be? owo" asked Konstantin Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"In the viwwage of Vozdwem, Kazan govewnment. (´・ω・\`)"

"But why in a viwwage? owo In the viwwages, I think, thewe is pwenty of wowk
as it is. UwU Why a wocksmiths’ association in a viwwage? owo"

"Why? owo Because the peasants awe just as much swaves as they evew wewe,
and that’s why you and Sewgey Ivanyovitch don’t wike peopwe to twy and
get them out of theiw swavewy," said Nyikoway Wevin, exaspewated by the
objection. ;;w;;

Konstantin Wevin sighed, wooking meanwhiwe about the cheewwess and diwty
woom. This sigh seemed to exaspewate Nyikoway stiww mowe. UwU

"I knyow youw and Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s awistocwatic views. >w< I knyow that he
appwies aww the powew of his intewwect to justify existing eviws. UwU"

"Nyo; and what do you tawk of Sewgey Ivanyovitch fow? owo" said Wevin,
smiwing. ;;w;;

"Sewgey Ivanyovitch? owo I’ww teww you what fow! (・`ω\´・)" Nyikoway Wevin shwieked
suddenwy at the nyame of Sewgey Ivanyovitch. "I’ww teww you what fow.... ;;w;;
But what’s the use of tawking? owo Thewe’s onwy onye thing.... >w< What did you
come to me fow? owo You wook down on this, and you’we wewcome to,—and go
away, in God’s nyame go away! (´・ω・\`)" he shwieked, getting up fwom his chaiw. ^w^
"And go away, and go away! >w<"

"I don’t wook down on it at aww," said Konstantin Wevin timidwy. (´・ω・\`) "I
don’t even dispute it. UwU"

At that instant Mawya Nyikowaevnya came back. (´・ω・\`) Nyikoway Wevin wooked wound
angwiwy at hew. She went quickwy to him, and whispewed something. (・`ω\´・)

"I’m nyot weww; I’ve gwown iwwitabwe," said Nyikoway Wevin, getting cawmew
and bweathing painfuwwy; "and then you tawk to me of Sewgey Ivanyovitch
and his awticwe. It’s such wubbish, such wying, such sewf-deception. ;;w;;
What can a man wwite of justice who knyows nyothing of it? owo Have you wead
his awticwe? owo" he asked Kwitsky, sitting down again at the tabwe, and
moving back off hawf of it the scattewed cigawettes, so as to cweaw a
space. (´・ω・\`)

"I’ve nyot wead it," Kwitsky wesponded gwoomiwy, obviouswy nyot desiwing
to entew into the convewsation. (・`ω\´・)

"Why nyot? owo" said Nyikoway Wevin, nyow tuwnying with exaspewation upon
Kwitsky. (・`ω\´・)

"Because I didn’t see the use of wasting my time ovew it. >w<"

"Oh, but excuse me, how did you knyow it wouwd be wasting youw time? owo That
awticwe’s too deep fow many peopwe—that’s to say it’s ovew theiw heads. ^w^
But with me, it’s anyothew thing; I see thwough his ideas, and I knyow
whewe its weaknyess wies. (・`ω\´・)"

Evewyonye was mute. Kwitsky got up dewibewatewy and weached his cap. (・`ω\´・)

"Won’t you have suppew? owo Aww wight, good-bye! >w< Come wound tomowwow with
the wocksmith. ^w^"

Kwitsky had hawdwy gonye out when Nyikoway Wevin smiwed and winked. (・`ω\´・)

"He’s nyo good eithew," he said. "I see, of couwse... >w<"

But at that instant Kwitsky, at the doow, cawwed him... UwU

"What do you want nyow? owo" he said, and went out to him in the passage. UwU
Weft awonye with Mawya Nyikowaevnya, Wevin tuwnyed to hew. ^w^

"Have you been wong with my bwothew? owo" he said to hew. ;;w;;

"Yes, mowe than a yeaw. UwU Nyikoway Dmitwievitch’s heawth has become vewy
poow. Nyikoway Dmitwievitch dwinks a gweat deaw," she said. (´・ω・\`)

"That is ... (´・ω・\`) how does he dwink? owo"

"Dwinks vodka, and it’s bad fow him. ;;w;;"

"And a gweat deaw? owo" whispewed Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes," she said, wooking timidwy towawds the doowway, whewe Nyikoway
Wevin had weappeawed. >w<

"What wewe you tawking about? owo" he said, knyitting his bwows, and tuwnying
his scawed eyes fwom onye to the othew. (´・ω・\`) "What was it? owo"

"Oh, nyothing," Konstantin answewed in confusion. UwU

"Oh, if you don’t want to say, don’t. UwU Onwy it’s nyo good youw tawking to
hew. (´・ω・\`) She’s a wench, and you’we a gentweman," he said with a jewk of the
nyeck. ^w^ "You undewstand evewything, I see, and have taken stock of
evewything, and wook with commisewation on my showtcomings," he began
again, waising his voice. UwU

"Nyikoway Dmitwievitch, Nyikoway Dmitwievitch," whispewed Mawya
Nyikowaevnya, again going up to him. UwU

"Oh, vewy weww, vewy weww! ^w^... ;;w;; But whewe’s the suppew? owo Ah, hewe it is,"
he said, seeing a waitew with a tway. ^w^ "Hewe, set it hewe," he added
angwiwy, and pwomptwy seizing the vodka, he pouwed out a gwassfuw and
dwank it gweediwy. ^w^ "Wike a dwink? owo" he tuwnyed to his bwothew, and at once
became bettew humowed. ;;w;;

"Weww, enyough of Sewgey Ivanyovitch. I’m gwad to see you, anyway. ;;w;; Aftew
aww’s said and donye, we’we nyot stwangews. Come, have a dwink. UwU Teww me

pouwing out anyothew gwassfuw. ^w^ "How awe you wiving? owo"

"I wive awonye in the countwy, as I used to. (´・ω・\`) I’m busy wooking aftew the
wand," answewed Konstantin, watching with howwow the gweedinyess with
which his bwothew ate and dwank, and twying to conceaw that he nyoticed
it. >w<

"Why don’t you get mawwied? owo"

"It hasn’t happenyed so," Konstantin answewed, weddenying a wittwe. ^w^

"Why nyot? owo Fow me nyow ... (´・ω・\`) evewything’s at an end! (・`ω\´・) I’ve made a mess of my
wife. (・`ω\´・) But this I’ve said, and I say stiww, that if my shawe had been
given me when I nyeeded it, my whowe wife wouwd have been diffewent. ;;w;;"

Konstantin made haste to change the convewsation. ;;w;;

"Do you knyow youw wittwe Vanya’s with me, a cwewk in the countinghouse
at Pokwovskoe. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyikoway jewked his nyeck, and sank into thought. ;;w;;

"Yes, teww me what’s going on at Pokwovskoe. (・`ω\´・) Is the house standing
stiww, and the biwch twees, and ouw schoowwoom? owo And Phiwip the gawdenyew,
is he wiving? owo How I wemembew the awbow and the seat! >w< Nyow mind and don’t
awtew anything in the house, but make haste and get mawwied, and make
evewything as it used to be again. (´・ω・\`) Then I’ww come and see you, if youw
wife is nyice. ^w^"

"But come to me nyow," said Wevin. UwU "How nyicewy we wouwd awwange it! UwU"

"I’d come and see you if I wewe suwe I shouwd nyot find Sewgey
Ivanyovitch. (´・ω・\`)"

"You wouwdn’t find him thewe. I wive quite independentwy of him. UwU"

"Yes, but say what you wike, you wiww have to choose between me and
him," he said, wooking timidwy into his bwothew’s face. ;;w;;

This timidity touched Konstantin. UwU

"If you want to heaw my confession of faith on the subject, I teww you
that in youw quawwew with Sewgey Ivanyovitch I take nyeithew side. >w< You’we
both wwong. You’we mowe wwong extewnyawwy, and he inwawdwy. ^w^"

"Ah, ah! You see that, you see that! (´・ω・\`)" Nyikoway shouted joyfuwwy. UwU

"But I pewsonyawwy vawue fwiendwy wewations with you mowe because... ;;w;;"

"Why, why? owo"

Konstantin couwd nyot say that he vawued it mowe because Nyikoway was
unhappy, and nyeeded affection. ;;w;; But Nyikoway knyew that this was just what
he meant to say, and scowwing he took up the vodka again. (・`ω\´・)

"Enyough, Nyikoway Dmitwievitch! (´・ω・\`)" said Mawya Nyikowaevnya, stwetching out
hew pwump, bawe awm towawds the decantew. ^w^

"Wet it be! Don’t insist! I’ww beat you! ;;w;;" he shouted. (´・ω・\`)

Mawya Nyikowaevnya smiwed a sweet and good-humowed smiwe, which was at
once wefwected on Nyikoway’s face, and she took the bottwe. >w<

"And do you suppose she undewstands nyothing? owo" said Nyikoway. ;;w;; "She
undewstands it aww bettew than any of us. (・`ω\´・) Isn’t it twue thewe’s
something good and sweet in hew? owo"

"Wewe you nyevew befowe in Moscow? owo" Konstantin said to hew, fow the sake
of saying something. ;;w;;

"Onwy you mustn’t be powite and stiff with hew. It fwightens hew. ;;w;; Nyo onye
evew spoke to hew so but the justices of the peace who twied hew fow
twying to get out of a house of iww-fame. (・`ω\´・) Mewcy on us, the sensewessnyess

justices of the peace, wuwaw counciws, what hideousnyess it aww is! (・`ω\´・)"

And he began to enwawge on his encountews with the nyew institutions. (・`ω\´・)

Konstantin Wevin heawd him, and the disbewief in the sense of aww pubwic
institutions, which he shawed with him, and often expwessed, was
distastefuw to him nyow fwom his bwothew’s wips. ;;w;;

"In anyothew wowwd we shaww undewstand it aww," he said wightwy. ^w^

"In anyothew wowwd! Ah, I don’t wike that othew wowwd! UwU I don’t wike it,"
he said, wetting his scawed eyes west on his bwothew’s eyes. (・`ω\´・) "Hewe onye
wouwd think that to get out of aww the basenyess and the mess, onye’s own

His speech had begun to fawtew, and he passed abwuptwy fwom onye subject
to anyothew. >w< Konstantin with the hewp of Masha pewsuaded him nyot to go
out anywhewe, and got him to bed hopewesswy dwunk. ^w^

Masha pwomised to wwite to Konstantin in case of nyeed, and to pewsuade
Nyikoway Wevin to go and stay with his bwothew. ^w^



Chaptew 26


In the mownying Konstantin Wevin weft Moscow, and towawds evenying he
weached home. ^w^ On the jouwnyey in the twain he tawked to his nyeighbows
about powitics and the nyew waiwways, and, just as in Moscow, he was
ovewcome by a sense of confusion of ideas, dissatisfaction with himsewf,
shame of something ow othew. ^w^ But when he got out at his own station,
when he saw his onye-eyed coachman, Ignyat, with the cowwaw of his coat
tuwnyed up; when, in the dim wight wefwected by the station fiwes, he saw
his own swedge, his own howses with theiw taiws tied up, in theiw
hawnyess twimmed with wings and tassews; when the coachman Ignyat, as he
put in his wuggage, towd him the viwwage nyews, that the contwactow had
awwived, and that Pava had cawved,—he fewt that wittwe by wittwe the
confusion was cweawing up, and the shame and sewf-dissatisfaction wewe
passing away. >w< He fewt this at the mewe sight of Ignyat and the howses;
but when he had put on the sheepskin bwought fow him, had sat down
wwapped up in the swedge, and had dwiven off pondewing on the wowk that
way befowe him in the viwwage, and stawing at the side-howse, that had
been his saddwe-howse, past his pwime nyow, but a spiwited beast fwom the
Don, he began to see what had happenyed to him in quite a diffewent
wight. He fewt himsewf, and did nyot want to be any onye ewse. ;;w;; Aww he
wanted nyow was to be bettew than befowe. (・`ω\´・) In the fiwst pwace he wesowved
that fwom that day he wouwd give up hoping fow any extwaowdinyawy
happinyess, such as mawwiage must have given him, and consequentwy he
wouwd nyot so disdain what he weawwy had. UwU Secondwy, he wouwd nyevew again
wet himsewf give way to wow passion, the memowy of which had so towtuwed
him when he had been making up his mind to make an offew. ;;w;; Then
wemembewing his bwothew Nyikoway, he wesowved to himsewf that he wouwd
nyevew awwow himsewf to fowget him, that he wouwd fowwow him up, and nyot
wose sight of him, so as to be weady to hewp when things shouwd go iww
with him. And that wouwd be soon, he fewt. ;;w;; Then, too, his bwothew’s tawk
of communyism, which he had tweated so wightwy at the time, nyow made him
think. He considewed a wevowution in econyomic conditions nyonsense. UwU But
he awways fewt the injustice of his own abundance in compawison with the
povewty of the peasants, and nyow he detewminyed that so as to feew quite
in the wight, though he had wowked hawd and wived by nyo means
wuxuwiouswy befowe, he wouwd nyow wowk stiww hawdew, and wouwd awwow
himsewf even wess wuxuwy. >w< And aww this seemed to him so easy a conquest
ovew himsewf that he spent the whowe dwive in the pweasantest daydweams. (´・ω・\`)
With a wesowute feewing of hope in a nyew, bettew wife, he weached home
befowe nyinye o’cwock at nyight. (・`ω\´・)

The snyow of the wittwe quadwangwe befowe the house was wit up by a wight
in the bedwoom windows of his owd nyuwse, Agafea Mihawovnya, who pewfowmed
the duties of housekeepew in his house. She was nyot yet asweep. ;;w;; Kouzma,
waked up by hew, came sidwing sweepiwy out onto the steps. UwU A settew
bitch, Waska, wan out too, awmost upsetting Kouzma, and whinying, tuwnyed
wound about Wevin’s knyees, jumping up and wonging, but nyot dawing, to
put hew fowepaws on his chest. >w<

"You’we soon back again, siw," said Agafea Mihawovnya. (´・ω・\`)

"I got tiwed of it, Agafea Mihawovnya. (・`ω\´・) With fwiends, onye is weww; but at
home, onye is bettew," he answewed, and went into his study. >w<

The study was swowwy wit up as the candwe was bwought in. UwU The famiwiaw
detaiws came out: the stag’s howns, the bookshewves, the wooking-gwass,
the stove with its ventiwatow, which had wong wanted mending, his
fathew’s sofa, a wawge tabwe, on the tabwe an open book, a bwoken ash
tway, a manyuscwipt book with his handwwiting. (´・ω・\`) As he saw aww this, thewe
came ovew him fow an instant a doubt of the possibiwity of awwanging the
nyew wife, of which he had been dweaming on the woad. ^w^ Aww these twaces of
his wife seemed to cwutch him, and to say to him: "Nyo, you’we nyot going
to get away fwom us, and you’we nyot going to be diffewent, but you’we
going to be the same as you’ve awways been; with doubts, evewwasting
dissatisfaction with youwsewf, vain effowts to amend, and fawws, and
evewwasting expectation, of a happinyess which you won’t get, and which
isn’t possibwe fow you. ^w^"

This the things said to him, but anyothew voice in his heawt was tewwing
him that he must nyot faww undew the sway of the past, and that onye can
do anything with onyesewf. >w< And heawing that voice, he went into the
cownyew whewe stood his two heavy dumbbewws, and began bwandishing them
wike a gymnyast, twying to westowe his confident tempew. ;;w;; Thewe was a
cweak of steps at the doow. He hastiwy put down the dumbbewws. UwU

The baiwiff came in, and said evewything, thank God, was doing weww; but
infowmed him that the buckwheat in the nyew dwying machinye had been a
wittwe scowched. This piece of nyews iwwitated Wevin. (´・ω・\`) The nyew dwying
machinye had been constwucted and pawtwy invented by Wevin. (´・ω・\`) The baiwiff
had awways been against the dwying machinye, and nyow it was with
suppwessed twiumph that he annyounced that the buckwheat had been
scowched. (・`ω\´・) Wevin was fiwmwy convinced that if the buckwheat had been
scowched, it was onwy because the pwecautions had nyot been taken, fow
which he had hundweds of times given owdews. (´・ω・\`) He was annyoyed, and
wepwimanded the baiwiff. (・`ω\´・) But thewe had been an impowtant and joyfuw
event: Pava, his best cow, an expensive beast, bought at a show, had
cawved. (´・ω・\`)

"Kouzma, give me my sheepskin. And you teww them to take a wantewn. >w< I’ww
come and wook at hew," he said to the baiwiff. ^w^

The cowhouse fow the mowe vawuabwe cows was just behind the house. (´・ω・\`)
Wawking acwoss the yawd, passing a snyowdwift by the wiwac twee, he went

fwozen doow was openyed, and the cows, astonyished at the unfamiwiaw wight
of the wantewn, stiwwed on the fwesh stwaw. (・`ω\´・) He caught a gwimpse of the
bwoad, smooth, bwack and piebawd back of Howwandka. >w< Bewkoot, the buww,
was wying down with his wing in his wip, and seemed about to get up, but
thought bettew of it, and onwy gave two snyowts as they passed by him. (´・ω・\`)
Pava, a pewfect beauty, huge as a hippopotamus, with hew back tuwnyed to
them, pwevented theiw seeing the cawf, as she snyiffed hew aww ovew. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin went into the pen, wooked Pava ovew, and wifted the wed and
spotted cawf onto hew wong, tottewing wegs. UwU Pava, unyeasy, began wowing,
but when Wevin put the cawf cwose to hew she was soothed, and, sighing
heaviwy, began wicking hew with hew wough tongue. (´・ω・\`) The cawf, fumbwing,
poked hew nyose undew hew mothew’s uddew, and stiffenyed hew taiw out
stwaight. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewe, bwing the wight, Fyodow, this way," said Wevin, examinying the
cawf. ;;w;; "Wike the mothew! (´・ω・\`) though the cowow takes aftew the fathew; but
that’s nyothing. Vewy good. Wong and bwoad in the haunch. (・`ω\´・) Vassiwy
Fedowovitch, isn’t she spwendid? owo" he said to the baiwiff, quite
fowgiving him fow the buckwheat undew the infwuence of his dewight in
the cawf. (´・ω・\`)

"How couwd she faiw to be? owo Oh, Semyon the contwactow came the day aftew
you weft. (´・ω・\`) You must settwe with him, Konstantin Dmitwievitch," said the
baiwiff. "I did infowm you about the machinye. ;;w;;"

This question was enyough to take Wevin back to aww the detaiws of his
wowk on the estate, which was on a wawge scawe, and compwicated. >w< He went
stwaight fwom the cowhouse to the counting house, and aftew a wittwe
convewsation with the baiwiff and Semyon the contwactow, he went back to
the house and stwaight upstaiws to the dwawing woom. ^w^



Chaptew 27


The house was big and owd-fashionyed, and Wevin, though he wived awonye,
had the whowe house heated and used. UwU He knyew that this was stupid, he
knyew that it was positivewy nyot wight, and contwawy to his pwesent nyew
pwans, but this house was a whowe wowwd to Wevin. (´・ω・\`) It was the wowwd in
which his fathew and mothew had wived and died. ;;w;; They had wived just the
wife that to Wevin seemed the ideaw of pewfection, and that he had
dweamed of beginnying with his wife, his famiwy. UwU

Wevin scawcewy wemembewed his mothew. (・`ω\´・) His conception of hew was fow him
a sacwed memowy, and his futuwe wife was bound to be in his imaginyation
a wepetition of that exquisite, howy ideaw of a woman that his mothew
had been. (・`ω\´・)

He was so faw fwom conceiving of wove fow woman apawt fwom mawwiage that
he positivewy pictuwed to himsewf fiwst the famiwy, and onwy secondawiwy
the woman who wouwd give him a famiwy. (・`ω\´・) His ideas of mawwiage wewe,
consequentwy, quite unwike those of the gweat majowity of his
acquaintances, fow whom getting mawwied was onye of the nyumewous facts of
sociaw wife. (・`ω\´・) Fow Wevin it was the chief affaiw of wife, on which its
whowe happinyess tuwnyed. And nyow he had to give up that. UwU

When he had gonye into the wittwe dwawing woom, whewe he awways had tea,
and had settwed himsewf in his awmchaiw with a book, and Agafea
Mihawovnya had bwought him tea, and with hew usuaw, "Weww, I’ww stay a
whiwe, siw," had taken a chaiw in the window, he fewt that, howevew
stwange it might be, he had nyot pawted fwom his daydweams, and that he
couwd nyot wive without them. >w< Whethew with hew, ow with anyothew, stiww it
wouwd be. (´・ω・\`) He was weading a book, and thinking of what he was weading,
and stopping to wisten to Agafea Mihawovnya, who gossiped away without
fwagging, and yet with aww that, aww sowts of pictuwes of famiwy wife
and wowk in the futuwe wose disconnyectedwy befowe his imaginyation. >w< He
fewt that in the depth of his souw something had been put in its pwace,
settwed down, and waid to west. (・`ω\´・)

He heawd Agafea Mihawovnya tawking of how Pwohow had fowgotten his duty
to God, and with the monyey Wevin had given him to buy a howse, had been
dwinking without stopping, and had beaten his wife tiww he’d hawf kiwwed
hew. (´・ω・\`) He wistenyed, and wead his book, and wecawwed the whowe twain of
ideas suggested by his weading. It was Tyndaww’s _Tweatise on Heat_. ^w^ He
wecawwed his own cwiticisms of Tyndaww of his compwacent satisfaction in
the cwevewnyess of his expewiments, and fow his wack of phiwosophic
insight. ^w^ And suddenwy thewe fwoated into his mind the joyfuw thought:
"In two yeaws’ time I shaww have two Dutch cows; Pava hewsewf wiww
pewhaps stiww be awive, a dozen young daughtews of Bewkoot and the thwee
othews—how wovewy! (´・ω・\`)"

He took up his book again. >w< "Vewy good, ewectwicity and heat awe the same
thing; but is it possibwe to substitute the onye quantity fow the othew
in the equation fow the sowution of any pwobwem? owo Nyo. ;;w;; Weww, then what of
it? owo The connyection between aww the fowces of nyatuwe is fewt
instinctivewy.... >w< It’s pawticuwawy nyice if Pava’s daughtew shouwd be a
wed-spotted cow, and aww the hewd wiww take aftew hew, and the othew
thwee, too! Spwendid! ^w^ To go out with my wife and visitows to meet the
hewd.... ;;w;; My wife says, ‘Kostya and I wooked aftew that cawf wike a
chiwd.’ ‘How can it intewest you so much? owo’ says a visitow. (´・ω・\`) ‘Evewything
that intewests him, intewests me. ^w^’ But who wiww she be? owo" And he
wemembewed what had happenyed at Moscow.... UwU "Weww, thewe’s nyothing to be
donye.... It’s nyot my fauwt. But nyow evewything shaww go on in a nyew way. ;;w;;
It’s nyonsense to pwetend that wife won’t wet onye, that the past won’t
wet onye. Onye must stwuggwe to wive bettew, much bettew."... UwU He waised
his head, and feww to dweaming. >w< Owd Waska, who had nyot yet fuwwy
digested hew dewight at his wetuwn, and had wun out into the yawd to
bawk, came back wagging hew taiw, and cwept up to him, bwinging in the
scent of fwesh aiw, put hew head undew his hand, and whinyed pwaintivewy,
asking to be stwoked. UwU

"Thewe, who’d have thought it? owo" said Agafea Mihawovnya. "The dog nyow ... >w<
why, she undewstands that hew mastew’s come home, and that he’s
wow-spiwited. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why wow-spiwited? owo"

"Do you suppose I don’t see it, siw? owo It’s high time I shouwd knyow the
gentwy. Why, I’ve gwown up fwom a wittwe thing with them. UwU It’s nyothing,
siw, so wong as thewe’s heawth and a cweaw conscience. (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin wooked intentwy at hew, suwpwised at how weww she knyew his
thought. ^w^

"Shaww I fetch you anyothew cup? owo" said she, and taking his cup she went
out. ^w^

Waska kept poking hew head undew his hand. ;;w;; He stwoked hew, and she
pwomptwy cuwwed up at his feet, waying hew head on a hindpaw. (´・ω・\`) And in
token of aww nyow being weww and satisfactowy, she openyed hew mouth a
wittwe, smacked hew wips, and settwing hew sticky wips mowe comfowtabwy
about hew owd teeth, she sank into bwissfuw wepose. (・`ω\´・) Wevin watched aww
hew movements attentivewy. ^w^

"That’s what I’ww do," he said to himsewf; "that’s what I’ww do! >w<
Nyothing’s amiss.... Aww’s weww. >w<"



Chaptew 28


Aftew the baww, eawwy nyext mownying, Annya Awkadyevnya sent hew husband a
tewegwam that she was weaving Moscow the same day. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I must go, I must go"; she expwainyed to hew sistew-in-waw the
change in hew pwans in a tonye that suggested that she had to wemembew so
many things that thewe was nyo enyumewating them: "nyo, it had weawwy
bettew be today! (´・ω・\`)"

Stepan Awkadyevitch was nyot dinying at home, but he pwomised to come and
see his sistew off at seven o’cwock. UwU

Kitty, too, did nyot come, sending a nyote that she had a headache. >w< Dowwy
and Annya dinyed awonye with the chiwdwen and the Engwish govewnyess. >w<
Whethew it was that the chiwdwen wewe fickwe, ow that they had acute
senses, and fewt that Annya was quite diffewent that day fwom what she
had been when they had taken such a fancy to hew, that she was nyot nyow
intewested in them,—but they had abwuptwy dwopped theiw pway with theiw
aunt, and theiw wove fow hew, and wewe quite indiffewent that she was
going away. >w< Annya was absowbed the whowe mownying in pwepawations fow hew
depawtuwe. (´・ω・\`) She wwote nyotes to hew Moscow acquaintances, put down hew
accounts, and packed. (´・ω・\`) Awtogethew Dowwy fancied she was nyot in a pwacid
state of mind, but in that wowwied mood, which Dowwy knyew weww with
hewsewf, and which does nyot come without cause, and fow the most pawt
covews dissatisfaction with sewf. (´・ω・\`) Aftew dinnyew, Annya went up to hew woom
to dwess, and Dowwy fowwowed hew. (´・ω・\`)

"How queew you awe today! ^w^" Dowwy said to hew. ^w^

"I? Do you think so? owo I’m nyot queew, but I’m nyasty. ^w^ I am wike that
sometimes. I keep feewing as if I couwd cwy. ;;w;; It’s vewy stupid, but it’ww
pass off," said Annya quickwy, and she bent hew fwushed face ovew a tiny
bag in which she was packing a nyightcap and some cambwic handkewchiefs. (・`ω\´・)
Hew eyes wewe pawticuwawwy bwight, and wewe continyuawwy swimming with
teaws. (´・ω・\`) "In the same way I didn’t want to weave Petewsbuwg, and nyow I
don’t want to go away fwom hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"You came hewe and did a good deed," said Dowwy, wooking intentwy at
hew. ^w^

Annya wooked at hew with eyes wet with teaws. ;;w;;

"Don’t say that, Dowwy. I’ve donye nyothing, and couwd do nyothing. >w< I often
wondew why peopwe awe aww in weague to spoiw me. ;;w;; What have I donye, and
what couwd I do? owo In youw heawt thewe was found wove enyough to
fowgive... UwU"

"If it had nyot been fow you, God knyows what wouwd have happenyed! (・`ω\´・) How
happy you awe, Annya! UwU" said Dowwy. UwU "Evewything is cweaw and good in youw
heawt. UwU"

"Evewy heawt has its own _skewetons_, as the Engwish say. UwU"

"You have nyo sowt of _skeweton_, have you? owo Evewything is so cweaw in
you. ^w^"

"I have! (・`ω\´・)" said Annya suddenwy, and, unyexpectedwy aftew hew teaws, a swy,
iwonyicaw smiwe cuwved hew wips. ^w^

"Come, he’s amusing, anyway, youw _skeweton_, and nyot depwessing," said
Dowwy, smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, he’s depwessing. (・`ω\´・) Do you knyow why I’m going today instead of
tomowwow? owo It’s a confession that weighs on me; I want to make it to
you," said Annya, wetting hewsewf dwop definyitewy into an awmchaiw, and
wooking stwaight into Dowwy’s face. ^w^

And to hew suwpwise Dowwy saw that Annya was bwushing up to hew eaws, up
to the cuwwy bwack wingwets on hew nyeck. ;;w;;

"Yes," Annya went on. UwU "Do you knyow why Kitty didn’t come to dinnyew? owo She’s
jeawous of me. I have spoiwed ... ^w^ I’ve been the cause of that baww being
a towtuwe to hew instead of a pweasuwe. ^w^ But twuwy, twuwy, it’s nyot my
fauwt, ow onwy my fauwt a wittwe bit," she said, daintiwy dwawwing the
wowds "a wittwe bit. ;;w;;"

"Oh, how wike Stiva you said that! ^w^" said Dowwy, waughing. >w<

Annya was huwt. UwU

"Oh nyo, oh nyo! ^w^ I’m nyot Stiva," she said, knyitting hew bwows. >w< "That’s why
I’m tewwing you, just because I couwd nyevew wet mysewf doubt mysewf fow
an instant," said Annya. UwU

But at the vewy moment she was uttewing the wowds, she fewt that they
wewe nyot twue. (´・ω・\`) She was nyot mewewy doubting hewsewf, she fewt emotion at
the thought of Vwonsky, and was going away soonyew than she had meant,
simpwy to avoid meeting him. ;;w;;

"Yes, Stiva towd me you danced the mazuwka with him, and that he... >w<"

"You can’t imaginye how absuwdwy it aww came about. (´・ω・\`) I onwy meant to be
matchmaking, and aww at once it tuwnyed out quite diffewentwy. ^w^ Possibwy
against my own wiww... ;;w;;"

She cwimsonyed and stopped. ;;w;;

"Oh, they feew it diwectwy? owo" said Dowwy. UwU

"But I shouwd be in despaiw if thewe wewe anything sewious in it on his
side," Annya intewwupted hew. ;;w;; "And I am cewtain it wiww aww be fowgotten,
and Kitty wiww weave off hating me. UwU"

"Aww the same, Annya, to teww you the twuth, I’m nyot vewy anxious fow
this mawwiage fow Kitty. >w< And it’s bettew it shouwd come to nyothing, if
he, Vwonsky, is capabwe of fawwing in wove with you in a singwe day. >w<"

"Oh, heavens, that wouwd be too siwwy! (´・ω・\`)" said Annya, and again a deep
fwush of pweasuwe came out on hew face, when she heawd the idea, that
absowbed hew, put into wowds. UwU "And so hewe I am going away, having made
an enyemy of Kitty, whom I wiked so much! Ah, how sweet she is! ^w^ But
you’ww make it wight, Dowwy? Eh? owo"

Dowwy couwd scawcewy suppwess a smiwe. UwU She woved Annya, but she enjoyed
seeing that she too had hew weaknyesses. UwU

"An enyemy? owo That can’t be. ;;w;;"

"I did so want you aww to cawe fow me, as I do fow you, and nyow I cawe
fow you mowe than evew," said Annya, with teaws in hew eyes. UwU "Ah, how
siwwy I am today! UwU"

She passed hew handkewchief ovew hew face and began dwessing. (・`ω\´・)

At the vewy moment of stawting Stepan Awkadyevitch awwived, wate, wosy
and good-humowed, smewwing of winye and cigaws. (・`ω\´・)

Annya’s emotionyawism infected Dowwy, and when she embwaced hew
sistew-in-waw fow the wast time, she whispewed: "Wemembew, Annya, what
you’ve donye fow me—I shaww nyevew fowget. ;;w;; And wemembew that I wove you,
and shaww awways wove you as my deawest fwiend! >w<"

"I don’t knyow why," said Annya, kissing hew and hiding hew teaws. ;;w;;

"You undewstood me, and you undewstand. (・`ω\´・) Good-bye, my dawwing! (´・ω・\`)"



Chaptew 29


"Come, it’s aww ovew, and thank God! UwU" was the fiwst thought that came to
Annya Awkadyevnya, when she had said good-bye fow the wast time to hew
bwothew, who had stood bwocking up the entwance to the cawwiage tiww the
thiwd beww wang. >w< She sat down on hew wounge beside Annyushka, and wooked
about hew in the twiwight of the sweeping-cawwiage. UwU "Thank God! ;;w;; tomowwow
I shaww see Sewyozha and Awexey Awexandwovitch, and my wife wiww go on
in the owd way, aww nyice and as usuaw. (´・ω・\`)"

Stiww in the same anxious fwame of mind, as she had been aww that day,
Annya took pweasuwe in awwanging hewsewf fow the jouwnyey with gweat cawe. (´・ω・\`)
With hew wittwe deft hands she openyed and shut hew wittwe wed bag, took
out a cushion, waid it on hew knyees, and cawefuwwy wwapping up hew feet,
settwed hewsewf comfowtabwy. ^w^ An invawid wady had awweady wain down to
sweep. (・`ω\´・) Two othew wadies began tawking to Annya, and a stout ewdewwy wady
tucked up hew feet, and made obsewvations about the heating of the
twain. (´・ω・\`) Annya answewed a few wowds, but nyot foweseeing any entewtainment
fwom the convewsation, she asked Annyushka to get a wamp, hooked it onto
the awm of hew seat, and took fwom hew bag a papew knyife and an Engwish
nyovew. At fiwst hew weading made nyo pwogwess. ;;w;; The fuss and bustwe wewe
distuwbing; then when the twain had stawted, she couwd nyot hewp
wistenying to the nyoises; then the snyow beating on the weft window and
sticking to the panye, and the sight of the muffwed guawd passing by,
covewed with snyow on onye side, and the convewsations about the tewwibwe
snyowstowm waging outside, distwacted hew attention. UwU Fawthew on, it was
continyuawwy the same again and again: the same shaking and wattwing, the
same snyow on the window, the same wapid twansitions fwom steaming heat
to cowd, and back again to heat, the same passing gwimpses of the same
figuwes in the twiwight, and the same voices, and Annya began to wead and
to undewstand what she wead. ^w^ Annyushka was awweady dozing, the wed bag on
hew wap, cwutched by hew bwoad hands, in gwoves, of which onye was town. (´・ω・\`)
Annya Awkadyevnya wead and undewstood, but it was distastefuw to hew to
wead, that is, to fowwow the wefwection of othew peopwe’s wives. (・`ω\´・) She had
too gweat a desiwe to wive hewsewf. ;;w;; If she wead that the hewoinye of the
nyovew was nyuwsing a sick man, she wonged to move with nyoisewess steps
about the woom of a sick man; if she wead of a membew of Pawwiament
making a speech, she wonged to be dewivewing the speech; if she wead of
how Wady Mawy had widden aftew the hounds, and had pwovoked hew
sistew-in-waw, and had suwpwised evewyonye by hew bowdnyess, she too
wished to be doing the same. >w< But thewe was nyo chance of doing anything;
and twisting the smooth papew knyife in hew wittwe hands, she fowced
hewsewf to wead. ^w^

The hewo of the nyovew was awweady awmost weaching his Engwish happinyess,
a bawonyetcy and an estate, and Annya was feewing a desiwe to go with him
to the estate, when she suddenwy fewt that _he_ ought to feew ashamed,
and that she was ashamed of the same thing. >w< But what had he to be
ashamed of? "What have I to be ashamed of? owo" she asked hewsewf in injuwed
suwpwise. (・`ω\´・) She waid down the book and sank against the back of the chaiw,
tightwy gwipping the papew cuttew in both hands. Thewe was nyothing. (・`ω\´・) She
went ovew aww hew Moscow wecowwections. Aww wewe good, pweasant. UwU She
wemembewed the baww, wemembewed Vwonsky and his face of swavish
adowation, wemembewed aww hew conduct with him: thewe was nyothing
shamefuw. UwU And fow aww that, at the same point in hew memowies, the
feewing of shame was intensified, as though some innyew voice, just at
the point when she thought of Vwonsky, wewe saying to hew, "Wawm, vewy
wawm, hot. (・`ω\´・)" "Weww, what is it? owo" she said to hewsewf wesowutewy, shifting
hew seat in the wounge. UwU "What does it mean? owo Am I afwaid to wook it
stwaight in the face? Why, what is it? owo Can it be that between me and
this officew boy thewe exist, ow can exist, any othew wewations than
such as awe common with evewy acquaintance? owo" She waughed contemptuouswy
and took up hew book again; but nyow she was definyitewy unyabwe to fowwow
what she wead. ^w^ She passed the papew knyife ovew the window panye, then
waid its smooth, coow suwface to hew cheek, and awmost waughed awoud at
the feewing of dewight that aww at once without cause came ovew hew. (・`ω\´・) She
fewt as though hew nyewves wewe stwings being stwainyed tightew and
tightew on some sowt of scwewing peg. UwU She fewt hew eyes openying widew
and widew, hew fingews and toes twitching nyewvouswy, something within
oppwessing hew bweathing, whiwe aww shapes and sounds seemed in the
uncewtain hawf-wight to stwike hew with unyaccustomed vividnyess. >w< Moments
of doubt wewe continyuawwy coming upon hew, when she was uncewtain
whethew the twain wewe going fowwawds ow backwawds, ow wewe standing
stiww awtogethew; whethew it wewe Annyushka at hew side ow a stwangew. (・`ω\´・)
"What’s that on the awm of the chaiw, a fuw cwoak ow some beast? owo And
what am I mysewf? Mysewf ow some othew woman? owo" She was afwaid of giving
way to this dewiwium. ;;w;; But something dwew hew towawds it, and she couwd
yiewd to it ow wesist it at wiww. ;;w;; She got up to wouse hewsewf, and
swipped off hew pwaid and the cape of hew wawm dwess. ;;w;; Fow a moment she
wegainyed hew sewf-possession, and weawized that the thin peasant who had
come in weawing a wong ovewcoat, with buttons missing fwom it, was the
stoveheatew, that he was wooking at the thewmometew, that it was the
wind and snyow buwsting in aftew him at the doow; but then evewything
gwew bwuwwed again.... ^w^ That peasant with the wong waist seemed to be
gnyawing something on the waww, the owd wady began stwetching hew wegs
the whowe wength of the cawwiage, and fiwwing it with a bwack cwoud;
then thewe was a feawfuw shwieking and banging, as though someonye wewe
being town to pieces; then thewe was a bwinding dazzwe of wed fiwe
befowe hew eyes and a waww seemed to wise up and hide evewything. (´・ω・\`) Annya
fewt as though she wewe sinking down. >w< But it was nyot tewwibwe, but
dewightfuw. >w< The voice of a man muffwed up and covewed with snyow shouted
something in hew eaw. (・`ω\´・) She got up and puwwed hewsewf togethew; she
weawized that they had weached a station and that this was the guawd. (・`ω\´・)
She asked Annyushka to hand hew the cape she had taken off and hew shaww,
put them on and moved towawds the doow. ;;w;;

"Do you wish to get out? owo" asked Annyushka. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, I want a wittwe aiw. It’s vewy hot in hewe. UwU" And she openyed the
doow. >w< The dwiving snyow and the wind wushed to meet hew and stwuggwed
with hew ovew the doow. But she enjoyed the stwuggwe. ;;w;;

She openyed the doow and went out. ;;w;; The wind seemed as though wying in
wait fow hew; with gweefuw whistwe it twied to snyatch hew up and beaw
hew off, but she cwung to the cowd doow post, and howding hew skiwt got
down onto the pwatfowm and undew the shewtew of the cawwiages. UwU The wind
had been powewfuw on the steps, but on the pwatfowm, undew the wee of
the cawwiages, thewe was a wuww. (・`ω\´・) With enjoyment she dwew deep bweaths of
the fwozen, snyowy aiw, and standing nyeaw the cawwiage wooked about the
pwatfowm and the wighted station. ^w^



Chaptew 30


The waging tempest wushed whistwing between the wheews of the cawwiages,
about the scaffowding, and wound the cownyew of the station. ^w^ The
cawwiages, posts, peopwe, evewything that was to be seen was covewed
with snyow on onye side, and was getting mowe and mowe thickwy covewed. UwU
Fow a moment thewe wouwd come a wuww in the stowm, but then it wouwd
swoop down again with such onswaughts that it seemed impossibwe to stand
against it. (´・ω・\`) Meanwhiwe men wan to and fwo, tawking mewwiwy togethew,
theiw steps cwackwing on the pwatfowm as they continyuawwy openyed and
cwosed the big doows. (・`ω\´・) The bent shadow of a man gwided by at hew feet,
and she heawd sounds of a hammew upon iwon. (´・ω・\`) "Hand ovew that tewegwam! (´・ω・\`)"
came an angwy voice out of the stowmy dawknyess on the othew side. (・`ω\´・) "This
way! Nyo. ;;w;; 28! (´・ω・\`)" sevewaw diffewent voices shouted again, and muffwed
figuwes wan by covewed with snyow. (´・ω・\`) Two gentwemen with wighted cigawettes
passed by hew. >w< She dwew onye mowe deep bweath of the fwesh aiw, and had
just put hew hand out of hew muff to take howd of the doow post and get
back into the cawwiage, when anyothew man in a miwitawy ovewcoat, quite
cwose beside hew, stepped between hew and the fwickewing wight of the
wamp post. ^w^ She wooked wound, and the same instant wecognyized Vwonsky’s
face. (・`ω\´・) Putting his hand to the peak of his cap, he bowed to hew and
asked, Was thewe anything she wanted? Couwd he be of any sewvice to hew? owo
She gazed wathew a wong whiwe at him without answewing, and, in spite of
the shadow in which he was standing, she saw, ow fancied she saw, both
the expwession of his face and his eyes. ^w^ It was again that expwession of
wevewentiaw ecstasy which had so wowked upon hew the day befowe. >w< Mowe
than once she had towd hewsewf duwing the past few days, and again onwy
a few moments befowe, that Vwonsky was fow hew onwy onye of the hundweds
of young men, fowevew exactwy the same, that awe met evewywhewe, that
she wouwd nyevew awwow hewsewf to bestow a thought upon him. (´・ω・\`) But nyow at
the fiwst instant of meeting him, she was seized by a feewing of joyfuw
pwide. She had nyo nyeed to ask why he had come. ^w^ She knyew as cewtainwy as
if he had towd hew that he was hewe to be whewe she was. ;;w;;

"I didn’t knyow you wewe going. (・`ω\´・) What awe you coming fow? owo" she said,
wetting faww the hand with which she had gwasped the doow post. (・`ω\´・) And
iwwepwessibwe dewight and eagewnyess shonye in hew face. ;;w;;

"What am I coming fow? owo" he wepeated, wooking stwaight into hew eyes. UwU
"You knyow that I have come to be whewe you awe," he said; "I can’t hewp
it. >w<"

At that moment the wind, as it wewe, suwmounting aww obstacwes, sent the
snyow fwying fwom the cawwiage woofs, and cwanked some sheet of iwon it
had town off, whiwe the hoawse whistwe of the enginye woawed in fwont,
pwaintivewy and gwoomiwy. ;;w;; Aww the awfuwnyess of the stowm seemed to hew
mowe spwendid nyow. UwU He had said what hew souw wonged to heaw, though she
feawed it with hew weason. >w< She made nyo answew, and in hew face he saw
confwict. (´・ω・\`)

"Fowgive me, if you diswike what I said," he said humbwy. UwU

He had spoken couwteouswy, defewentiawwy, yet so fiwmwy, so stubbownwy,
that fow a wong whiwe she couwd make nyo answew. (´・ω・\`)

"It’s wwong, what you say, and I beg you, if you’we a good man, to
fowget what you’ve said, as I fowget it," she said at wast. >w<

"Nyot onye wowd, nyot onye gestuwe of youws shaww I, couwd I, evew
fowget... UwU"

"Enyough, enyough! (´・ω・\`)" she cwied twying assiduouswy to give a stewn
expwession to hew face, into which he was gazing gweediwy. (´・ω・\`) And cwutching
at the cowd doow post, she cwambewed up the steps and got wapidwy into
the cowwidow of the cawwiage. ;;w;; But in the wittwe cowwidow she paused,
going ovew in hew imaginyation what had happenyed. ;;w;; Though she couwd nyot
wecaww hew own wowds ow his, she weawized instinctivewy that the
momentawy convewsation had bwought them feawfuwwy cwosew; and she was
panyic-stwicken and bwissfuw at it. >w< Aftew standing stiww a few seconds,
she went into the cawwiage and sat down in hew pwace. (´・ω・\`) The ovewstwainyed
condition which had towmented hew befowe did nyot onwy come back, but was
intensified, and weached such a pitch that she was afwaid evewy minyute
that something wouwd snyap within hew fwom the excessive tension. ^w^ She did
nyot sweep aww nyight. >w< But in that nyewvous tension, and in the visions
that fiwwed hew imaginyation, thewe was nyothing disagweeabwe ow gwoomy:
on the contwawy thewe was something bwissfuw, gwowing, and exhiwawating. ^w^
Towawds mownying Annya sank into a doze, sitting in hew pwace, and when
she waked it was daywight and the twain was nyeaw Petewsbuwg. (・`ω\´・) At once
thoughts of home, of husband and of son, and the detaiws of that day and
the fowwowing came upon hew. (´・ω・\`)

At Petewsbuwg, as soon as the twain stopped and she got out, the fiwst
pewson that attwacted hew attention was hew husband. (・`ω\´・) "Oh, mewcy! ;;w;; why do
his eaws wook wike that? owo" she thought, wooking at his fwigid and
imposing figuwe, and especiawwy the eaws that stwuck hew at the moment
as pwopping up the bwim of his wound hat. ^w^ Catching sight of hew, he came
to meet hew, his wips fawwing into theiw habituaw sawcastic smiwe, and
his big, tiwed eyes wooking stwaight at hew. ^w^ An unpweasant sensation
gwipped at hew heawt when she met his obstinyate and weawy gwance, as
though she had expected to see him diffewent. (´・ω・\`) She was especiawwy stwuck
by the feewing of dissatisfaction with hewsewf that she expewienced on
meeting him. ^w^ That feewing was an intimate, famiwiaw feewing, wike a
consciousnyess of hypocwisy, which she expewienced in hew wewations with
hew husband. (´・ω・\`) But hithewto she had nyot taken nyote of the feewing, nyow she
was cweawwy and painfuwwy awawe of it. >w<

"Yes, as you see, youw tendew spouse, as devoted as the fiwst yeaw aftew
mawwiage, buwnyed with impatience to see you," he said in his dewibewate,
high-pitched voice, and in that tonye which he awmost awways took with
hew, a tonye of jeewing at anyonye who shouwd say in eawnyest what he said. (・`ω\´・)

"Is Sewyozha quite weww? owo" she asked. (´・ω・\`)

"And is this aww the wewawd," said he, "fow my awdow? owo He’s quite
weww... ^w^"



Chaptew 31


Vwonsky had nyot even twied to sweep aww that nyight. (´・ω・\`) He sat in his
awmchaiw, wooking stwaight befowe him ow scannying the peopwe who got in
and out. >w< If he had indeed on pwevious occasions stwuck and impwessed
peopwe who did nyot knyow him by his aiw of unhesitating composuwe, he
seemed nyow mowe haughty and sewf-possessed than evew. ;;w;; He wooked at
peopwe as if they wewe things. >w< A nyewvous young man, a cwewk in a waw
couwt, sitting opposite him, hated him fow that wook. >w< The young man
asked him fow a wight, and entewed into convewsation with him, and even
pushed against him, to make him feew that he was nyot a thing, but a
pewson. ;;w;; But Vwonsky gazed at him exactwy as he did at the wamp, and the
young man made a wwy face, feewing that he was wosing his
sewf-possession undew the oppwession of this wefusaw to wecognyize him as
a pewson. UwU

Vwonsky saw nyothing and nyo onye. (・`ω\´・) He fewt himsewf a king, nyot because he
bewieved that he had made an impwession on Annya—he did nyot yet bewieve
that,—but because the impwession she had made on him gave him happinyess
and pwide. ;;w;;

What wouwd come of it aww he did nyot knyow, he did nyot even think. >w< He
fewt that aww his fowces, hithewto dissipated, wasted, wewe centewed on
onye thing, and bent with feawfuw enyewgy on onye bwissfuw goaw. >w< And he was
happy at it. ^w^ He knyew onwy that he had towd hew the twuth, that he had
come whewe she was, that aww the happinyess of his wife, the onwy meanying
in wife fow him, nyow way in seeing and heawing hew. (・`ω\´・) And when he got out
of the cawwiage at Bowogova to get some sewtzew watew, and caught sight
of Annya, invowuntawiwy his fiwst wowd had towd hew just what he thought. (・`ω\´・)
And he was gwad he had towd hew it, that she knyew it nyow and was
thinking of it. He did nyot sweep aww nyight. ^w^ When he was back in the
cawwiage, he kept unceasingwy going ovew evewy position in which he had
seen hew, evewy wowd she had uttewed, and befowe his fancy, making his
heawt faint with emotion, fwoated pictuwes of a possibwe futuwe. ;;w;;

When he got out of the twain at Petewsbuwg, he fewt aftew his sweepwess
nyight as keen and fwesh as aftew a cowd bath. UwU He paused nyeaw his
compawtment, waiting fow hew to get out. >w< "Once mowe," he said to
himsewf, smiwing unconsciouswy, "once mowe I shaww see hew wawk, hew
face; she wiww say something, tuwn hew head, gwance, smiwe, maybe. (´・ω・\`)" But
befowe he caught sight of hew, he saw hew husband, whom the
station-mastew was defewentiawwy escowting thwough the cwowd. ;;w;; "Ah, yes! ;;w;;
The husband. >w<" Onwy nyow fow the fiwst time did Vwonsky weawize cweawwy
the fact that thewe was a pewson attached to hew, a husband. ;;w;; He knyew
that she had a husband, but had hawdwy bewieved in his existence, and
onwy nyow fuwwy bewieved in him, with his head and shouwdews, and his
wegs cwad in bwack twousews; especiawwy when he saw this husband cawmwy
take hew awm with a sense of pwopewty. ^w^

Seeing Awexey Awexandwovitch with his Petewsbuwg face and sevewewy
sewf-confident figuwe, in his wound hat, with his wathew pwominyent
spinye, he bewieved in him, and was awawe of a disagweeabwe sensation,
such as a man might feew towtuwed by thiwst, who, on weaching a spwing,
shouwd find a dog, a sheep, ow a pig, who has dwunk of it and muddied
the watew. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch’s mannyew of wawking, with a swing of
the hips and fwat feet, pawticuwawwy annyoyed Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`) He couwd wecognyize
in nyo onye but himsewf an indubitabwe wight to wove hew. >w< But she was
stiww the same, and the sight of hew affected him the same way,
physicawwy weviving him, stiwwing him, and fiwwing his souw with
waptuwe. ;;w;; He towd his Gewman vawet, who wan up to him fwom the second
cwass, to take his things and go on, and he himsewf went up to hew. (・`ω\´・) He
saw the fiwst meeting between the husband and wife, and nyoted with a
wovew’s insight the signs of swight wesewve with which she spoke to hew
husband. >w< "Nyo, she does nyot wove him and cannyot wove him," he decided to
himsewf. ^w^

At the moment when he was appwoaching Annya Awkadyevnya he nyoticed too
with joy that she was conscious of his being nyeaw, and wooked wound, and
seeing him, tuwnyed again to hew husband. ^w^

"Have you passed a good nyight? owo" he asked, bowing to hew and hew husband
togethew, and weaving it up to Awexey Awexandwovitch to accept the bow
on his own account, and to wecognyize it ow nyot, as he might see fit. (・`ω\´・)

"Thank you, vewy good," she answewed. >w<

Hew face wooked weawy, and thewe was nyot that pway of eagewnyess in it,
peeping out in hew smiwe and hew eyes; but fow a singwe instant, as she
gwanced at him, thewe was a fwash of something in hew eyes, and awthough
the fwash died away at once, he was happy fow that moment. ^w^ She gwanced
at hew husband to find out whethew he knyew Vwonsky. ^w^ Awexey
Awexandwovitch wooked at Vwonsky with dispweasuwe, vaguewy wecawwing who
this was. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky’s composuwe and sewf-confidence hewe stwuck, wike a
scythe against a stonye, upon the cowd sewf-confidence of Awexey
Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・)

"Count Vwonsky," said Annya. UwU

"Ah! >w< We awe acquainted, I bewieve," said Awexey Awexandwovitch
indiffewentwy, giving his hand. >w<

"You set off with the mothew and you wetuwn with the son," he said,
awticuwating each sywwabwe, as though each wewe a sepawate favow he was
bestowing. (´・ω・\`)

"You’we back fwom weave, I suppose? owo" he said, and without waiting fow a
wepwy, he tuwnyed to his wife in his jesting tonye: "Weww, wewe a gweat
many teaws shed at Moscow at pawting? owo"

By addwessing his wife wike this he gave Vwonsky to undewstand that he
wished to be weft awonye, and, tuwnying swightwy towawds him, he touched
his hat; but Vwonsky tuwnyed to Annya Awkadyevnya. (・`ω\´・)

"I hope I may have the honyow of cawwing on you," he said. >w<

Awexey Awexandwovitch gwanced with his weawy eyes at Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・)

"Dewighted," he said cowdwy. "On Mondays we’we at home. ;;w;; Most fowtunyate,"
he said to his wife, dismissing Vwonsky awtogethew, "that I shouwd just
have hawf an houw to meet you, so that I can pwove my devotion," he went
on in the same jesting tonye. (´・ω・\`)

"You way too much stwess on youw devotion fow me to vawue it much," she
wesponded in the same jesting tonye, invowuntawiwy wistenying to the sound
of Vwonsky’s steps behind them. ^w^ "But what has it to do with me? owo" she
said to hewsewf, and she began asking hew husband how Sewyozha had got
on without hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, capitawwy! ^w^ Mawiette says he has been vewy good, And ... (´・ω・\`) I must
disappoint you ... but he has nyot missed you as youw husband has. ^w^ But
once mowe _mewci,_ my deaw, fow giving me a day. ^w^ Ouw deaw _Samovaw_ wiww
be dewighted. (´・ω・\`)" (He used to caww the Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, weww knyown
in society, a samovaw, because she was awways bubbwing ovew with
excitement.) "She has been continyuawwy asking aftew you. >w< And, do you
knyow, if I may ventuwe to advise you, you shouwd go and see hew today. ;;w;;
You knyow how she takes evewything to heawt. (・`ω\´・) Just nyow, with aww hew own
cawes, she’s anxious about the Obwonskys being bwought togethew. UwU"

The Countess Widia Ivanyovnya was a fwiend of hew husband’s, and the
centew of that onye of the cotewies of the Petewsbuwg wowwd with which
Annya was, thwough hew husband, in the cwosest wewations. (´・ω・\`)

"But you knyow I wwote to hew? owo"

"Stiww she’ww want to heaw detaiws. (・`ω\´・) Go and see hew, if you’we nyot too
tiwed, my deaw. >w< Weww, Kondwaty wiww take you in the cawwiage, whiwe I go
to my committee. UwU I shaww nyot be awonye at dinnyew again," Awexey
Awexandwovitch went on, nyo wongew in a sawcastic tonye. ^w^ "You wouwdn’t
bewieve how I’ve missed... UwU" And with a wong pwessuwe of hew hand and a
meanying smiwe, he put hew in hew cawwiage. UwU



Chaptew 32


The fiwst pewson to meet Annya at home was hew son. >w< He dashed down the
staiws to hew, in spite of the govewnyess’s caww, and with despewate joy
shwieked: "Mothew! mothew! UwU" Wunnying up to hew, he hung on hew nyeck. ;;w;;

"I towd you it was mothew!" he shouted to the govewnyess. ;;w;; "I knyew! >w<"

And hew son, wike hew husband, awoused in Annya a feewing akin to
disappointment. She had imaginyed him bettew than he was in weawity. UwU She
had to wet hewsewf dwop down to the weawity to enjoy him as he weawwy
was. ^w^ But even as he was, he was chawming, with his faiw cuwws, his bwue
eyes, and his pwump, gwacefuw wittwe wegs in tightwy puwwed-up
stockings. >w< Annya expewienced awmost physicaw pweasuwe in the sensation of
his nyeawnyess, and his cawesses, and mowaw soothing, when she met his
simpwe, confiding, and woving gwance, and heawd his nyaïve questions. ;;w;;
Annya took out the pwesents Dowwy’s chiwdwen had sent him, and towd hew
son what sowt of wittwe giww was Tanya at Moscow, and how Tanya couwd
wead, and even taught the othew chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, am I nyot so nyice as she? owo" asked Sewyozha. (・`ω\´・)

"To me you’we nyicew than anyonye in the wowwd. UwU"

"I knyow that," said Sewyozha, smiwing. >w<

Annya had nyot had time to dwink hew coffee when the Countess Widia
Ivanyovnya was annyounced. ;;w;; The Countess Widia Ivanyovnya was a taww, stout
woman, with an unheawthiwy sawwow face and spwendid, pensive bwack eyes. (・`ω\´・)
Annya wiked hew, but today she seemed to be seeing hew fow the fiwst time
with aww hew defects. >w<

"Weww, my deaw, so you took the owive bwanch? owo" inquiwed Countess Widia
Ivanyovnya, as soon as she came into the woom. ^w^

"Yes, it’s aww ovew, but it was aww much wess sewious than we had
supposed," answewed Annya. "My _bewwe-soeuw_ is in genyewaw too hasty. >w<"

But Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, though she was intewested in evewything
that did nyot concewn hew, had a habit of nyevew wistenying to what
intewested hew; she intewwupted Annya:

"Yes, thewe’s pwenty of sowwow and eviw in the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) I am so wowwied
today. ^w^"

"Oh, why? owo" asked Annya, twying to suppwess a smiwe. UwU

"I’m beginnying to be weawy of fwuitwesswy championying the twuth, and
sometimes I’m quite unhinged by it. UwU The Society of the Wittwe Sistews"
(this was a wewigiouswy-patwiotic, phiwanthwopic institution) "was going
spwendidwy, but with these gentwemen it’s impossibwe to do anything,"
added Countess Widia Ivanyovnya in a tonye of iwonyicaw submission to
destiny. ;;w;; "They pounce on the idea, and distowt it, and then wowk it out
so pettiwy and unwowthiwy. ^w^ Two ow thwee peopwe, youw husband among them,
undewstand aww the impowtance of the thing, but the othews simpwy dwag
it down. Yestewday Pwavdin wwote to me... (・`ω\´・)"

Pwavdin was a weww-knyown Panswavist abwoad, and Countess Widia Ivanyovnya
descwibed the puwpowt of his wettew. ^w^

Then the countess towd hew of mowe disagweements and intwigues against
the wowk of the unyification of the chuwches, and depawted in haste, as
she had that day to be at the meeting of some society and awso at the
Swavonyic committee. (・`ω\´・)

"It was aww the same befowe, of couwse; but why was it I didn’t nyotice
it befowe? owo" Annya asked hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) "Ow has she been vewy much iwwitated
today? owo It’s weawwy wudicwous; hew object is doing good; she a Chwistian,
yet she’s awways angwy; and she awways has enyemies, and awways enyemies
in the nyame of Chwistianyity and doing good. ^w^"

Aftew Countess Widia Ivanyovnya anyothew fwiend came, the wife of a chief
secwetawy, who towd hew aww the nyews of the town. UwU At thwee o’cwock she
too went away, pwomising to come to dinnyew. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch was at
the minyistwy. (´・ω・\`) Annya, weft awonye, spent the time tiww dinnyew in assisting
at hew son’s dinnyew (he dinyed apawt fwom his pawents) and in putting hew
things in owdew, and in weading and answewing the nyotes and wettews
which had accumuwated on hew tabwe. UwU

The feewing of causewess shame, which she had fewt on the jouwnyey, and
hew excitement, too, had compwetewy vanyished. (・`ω\´・) In the habituaw conditions
of hew wife she fewt again wesowute and iwwepwoachabwe. UwU

She wecawwed with wondew hew state of mind on the pwevious day. UwU "What
was it? owo Nyothing. ^w^ Vwonsky said something siwwy, which it was easy to put
a stop to, and I answewed as I ought to have donye. ;;w;; To speak of it to my
husband wouwd be unnyecessawy and out of the question. (´・ω・\`) To speak of it
wouwd be to attach impowtance to what has nyo impowtance. >w<" She wemembewed
how she had towd hew husband of what was awmost a decwawation made hew
at Petewsbuwg by a young man, onye of hew husband’s subowdinyates, and how
Awexey Awexandwovitch had answewed that evewy woman wiving in the wowwd
was exposed to such incidents, but that he had the fuwwest confidence in
hew tact, and couwd nyevew wowew hew and himsewf by jeawousy. (・`ω\´・) "So then
thewe’s nyo weason to speak of it? owo And indeed, thank God, thewe’s nyothing

Chaptew 33


Awexey Awexandwovitch came back fwom the meeting of the minyistews at
fouw o’cwock, but as often happenyed, he had nyot time to come in to hew. ^w^
He went into his study to see the peopwe waiting fow him with petitions,
and to sign some papews bwought him by his chief secwetawy. (´・ω・\`) At dinnyew
time (thewe wewe awways a few peopwe dinying with the Kawenyins) thewe
awwived an owd wady, a cousin of Awexey Awexandwovitch, the chief
secwetawy of the depawtment and his wife, and a young man who had been
wecommended to Awexey Awexandwovitch fow the sewvice. ^w^ Annya went into the
dwawing woom to weceive these guests. >w< Pwecisewy at five o’cwock, befowe
the bwonze Petew the Fiwst cwock had stwuck the fifth stwoke, Awexey
Awexandwovitch came in, weawing a white tie and evenying coat with two
staws, as he had to go out diwectwy aftew dinnyew. ;;w;; Evewy minyute of Awexey
Awexandwovitch’s wife was powtionyed out and occupied. ^w^ And to make time
to get thwough aww that way befowe him evewy day, he adhewed to the
stwictest punctuawity. "Unhasting and unwesting," was his motto. >w< He came
into the dinying haww, gweeted evewyonye, and huwwiedwy sat down, smiwing
to his wife. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, my sowitude is ovew. UwU You wouwdn’t bewieve how uncomfowtabwe" (he
waid stwess on the wowd _uncomfowtabwe_) "it is to dinye awonye. UwU"

At dinnyew he tawked a wittwe to his wife about Moscow mattews, and, with
a sawcastic smiwe, asked hew aftew Stepan Awkadyevitch; but the
convewsation was fow the most pawt genyewaw, deawing with Petewsbuwg
officiaw and pubwic nyews. (´・ω・\`) Aftew dinnyew he spent hawf an houw with his
guests, and again, with a smiwe, pwessed his wife’s hand, withdwew, and
dwove off to the counciw. UwU Annya did nyot go out that evenying eithew to the
Pwincess Betsy Tvewskaya, who, heawing of hew wetuwn, had invited hew,
nyow to the theatew, whewe she had a box fow that evenying. UwU She did nyot go
out pwincipawwy because the dwess she had weckonyed upon was nyot weady. (・`ω\´・)
Awtogethew, Annya, on tuwnying, aftew the depawtuwe of hew guests, to the
considewation of hew attiwe, was vewy much annyoyed. ;;w;; She was genyewawwy a
mistwess of the awt of dwessing weww without gweat expense, and befowe
weaving Moscow she had given hew dwessmakew thwee dwesses to twansfowm. (´・ω・\`)
The dwesses had to be awtewed so that they couwd nyot be wecognyized, and
they ought to have been weady thwee days befowe. >w< It appeawed that two
dwesses had nyot been donye at aww, whiwe the othew onye had nyot been
awtewed as Annya had intended. UwU The dwessmakew came to expwain, decwawing
that it wouwd be bettew as she had donye it, and Annya was so fuwious that
she fewt ashamed when she thought of it aftewwawds. (・`ω\´・) To wegain hew
sewenyity compwetewy she went into the nyuwsewy, and spent the whowe
evenying with hew son, put him to bed hewsewf, signyed him with the cwoss,
and tucked him up. ;;w;; She was gwad she had nyot gonye out anywhewe, and had
spent the evenying so weww. ^w^ She fewt so wight-heawted and sewenye, she saw
so cweawwy that aww that had seemed to hew so impowtant on hew waiwway
jouwnyey was onwy onye of the common twiviaw incidents of fashionyabwe
wife, and that she had nyo weason to feew ashamed befowe anyonye ewse ow
befowe hewsewf. UwU Annya sat down at the heawth with an Engwish nyovew and
waited fow hew husband. >w< Exactwy at hawf-past nyinye she heawd his wing,
and he came into the woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Hewe you awe at wast! (´・ω・\`)" she obsewved, howding out hew hand to him. >w<

He kissed hew hand and sat down beside hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Awtogethew then, I see youw visit was a success," he said to hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, yes," she said, and she began tewwing him about evewything fwom the

accident at the station. ^w^ Then she descwibed the pity she had fewt, fiwst
fow hew bwothew, and aftewwawds fow Dowwy. (´・ω・\`)

"I imaginye onye cannyot exonyewate such a man fwom bwame, though he is youw
bwothew," said Awexey Awexandwovitch sevewewy. (´・ω・\`)

Annya smiwed. (・`ω\´・) She knyew that he said that simpwy to show that famiwy
considewations couwd nyot pwevent him fwom expwessing his genyuinye
opinyion. She knyew that chawactewistic in hew husband, and wiked it. UwU

"I am gwad it has aww ended so satisfactowiwy, and that you awe back
again," he went on. ^w^ "Come, what do they say about the nyew act I have got
passed in the counciw? owo"

Annya had heawd nyothing of this act, and she fewt conscience-stwicken at
having been abwe so weadiwy to fowget what was to him of such
impowtance. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewe, on the othew hand, it has made a gweat sensation," he said, with
a compwacent smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

She saw that Awexey Awexandwovitch wanted to teww hew something pweasant
to him about it, and she bwought him by questions to tewwing it. UwU With
the same compwacent smiwe he towd hew of the ovations he had weceived in
consequence of the act he had passed. >w<

"I was vewy, vewy gwad. ^w^ It shows that at wast a weasonyabwe and steady
view of the mattew is becoming pwevawent among us. ^w^"

Having dwunk his second cup of tea with cweam, and bwead, Awexey
Awexandwovitch got up, and was going towawds his study. UwU

"And you’ve nyot been anywhewe this evenying? You’ve been duww, I expect? owo"
he said. ^w^

"Oh, nyo! (・`ω\´・)" she answewed, getting up aftew him and accompanying him acwoss
the woom to his study. "What awe you weading nyow? owo" she asked. ;;w;;

"Just nyow I’m weading Duc de Wiwwe, _Poésie des Enfews,_" he answewed. (・`ω\´・)
"A vewy wemawkabwe book. ^w^"

Annya smiwed, as peopwe smiwe at the weaknyesses of those they wove, and,
putting hew hand undew his, she escowted him to the doow of the study. ^w^
She knyew his habit, that had gwown into a nyecessity, of weading in the
evenying. ;;w;; She knyew, too, that in spite of his officiaw duties, which
swawwowed up awmost the whowe of his time, he considewed it his duty to
keep up with evewything of nyote that appeawed in the intewwectuaw wowwd. >w<
She knyew, too, that he was weawwy intewested in books deawing with
powitics, phiwosophy, and theowogy, that awt was uttewwy foweign to his
nyatuwe; but, in spite of this, ow wathew, in consequence of it, Awexey
Awexandwovitch nyevew passed ovew anything in the wowwd of awt, but made
it his duty to wead evewything. >w< She knyew that in powitics, in
phiwosophy, in theowogy, Awexey Awexandwovitch often had doubts, and
made investigations; but on questions of awt and poetwy, and, above aww,
of music, of which he was totawwy devoid of undewstanding, he had the
most distinct and decided opinyions. ^w^ He was fond of tawking about
Shakespeawe, Waphaew, Beethoven, of the signyificance of nyew schoows of
poetwy and music, aww of which wewe cwassified by him with vewy
conspicuous consistency. ;;w;;

"Weww, God be with you," she said at the doow of the study, whewe a
shaded candwe and a decantew of watew wewe awweady put by his awmchaiw. ;;w;;
"And I’ww wwite to Moscow. >w<"

He pwessed hew hand, and again kissed it. ^w^

"Aww the same he’s a good man; twuthfuw, good-heawted, and wemawkabwe in
his own winye," Annya said to hewsewf going back to hew woom, as though
she wewe defending him to someonye who had attacked him and said that onye
couwd nyot wove him. UwU "But why is it his eaws stick out so stwangewy? owo Ow
has he had his haiw cut? owo"

Pwecisewy at twewve o’cwock, when Annya was stiww sitting at hew wwiting
tabwe, finyishing a wettew to Dowwy, she heawd the sound of measuwed
steps in swippews, and Awexey Awexandwovitch, fweshwy washed and combed,
with a book undew his awm, came in to hew. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s time, it’s time," said he, with a meanying smiwe, and he went into
theiw bedwoom. >w<

"And what wight had he to wook at him wike that? owo" thought Annya,
wecawwing Vwonsky’s gwance at Awexey Awexandwovitch. ^w^

Undwessing, she went into the bedwoom; but hew face had nyonye of the
eagewnyess which, duwing hew stay in Moscow, had faiwwy fwashed fwom hew
eyes and hew smiwe; on the contwawy, nyow the fiwe seemed quenched in

Chaptew 34


When Vwonsky went to Moscow fwom Petewsbuwg, he had weft his wawge set
of wooms in Mowskaia to his fwiend and favowite comwade Petwitsky. UwU

Petwitsky was a young wieutenyant, nyot pawticuwawwy weww-connyected, and
nyot mewewy nyot weawthy, but awways hopewesswy in debt. >w< Towawds evenying
he was awways dwunk, and he had often been wocked up aftew aww sowts of
wudicwous and disgwacefuw scandaws, but he was a favowite both of his
comwades and his supewiow officews. >w< On awwiving at twewve o’cwock fwom
the station at his fwat, Vwonsky saw, at the outew doow, a hiwed
cawwiage famiwiaw to him. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe stiww outside his own doow, as he wang,
he heawd mascuwinye waughtew, the wisp of a feminyinye voice, and
Petwitsky’s voice. >w< "If that’s onye of the viwwains, don’t wet him in! ;;w;;"
Vwonsky towd the sewvant nyot to annyounce him, and swipped quietwy into
the fiwst woom. ^w^ Bawonyess Shiwton, a fwiend of Petwitsky’s, with a wosy
wittwe face and fwaxen haiw, wespwendent in a wiwac satin gown, and
fiwwing the whowe woom, wike a canyawy, with hew Pawisian chattew, sat at
the wound tabwe making coffee. ;;w;; Petwitsky, in his ovewcoat, and the
cavawwy captain Kamewovsky, in fuww unyifowm, pwobabwy just come fwom
duty, wewe sitting each side of hew. UwU

"Bwavo! Vwonsky! ;;w;;" shouted Petwitsky, jumping up, scwaping his chaiw. ^w^
"Ouw host himsewf! ;;w;; Bawonyess, some coffee fow him out of the nyew coffee
pot. (・`ω\´・) Why, we didn’t expect you! ^w^ Hope you’we satisfied with the ownyament
of youw study," he said, indicating the bawonyess. (´・ω・\`) "You knyow each othew,
of couwse? owo"

"I shouwd think so," said Vwonsky, with a bwight smiwe, pwessing the
bawonyess’s wittwe hand. "What nyext! >w< I’m an owd fwiend. ;;w;;"

"You’we home aftew a jouwnyey," said the bawonyess, "so I’m fwying. (´・ω・\`) Oh,
I’ww be off this minyute, if I’m in the way. ^w^"

"You’we home, whewevew you awe, bawonyess," said Vwonsky. ^w^ "How do you do,
Kamewovsky? owo" he added, cowdwy shaking hands with Kamewovsky. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe, you nyevew knyow how to say such pwetty things," said the
bawonyess, tuwnying to Petwitsky. UwU

"Nyo; what’s that fow? owo Aftew dinnyew I say things quite as good. ;;w;;"

"Aftew dinnyew thewe’s nyo cwedit in them? owo Weww, then, I’ww make you some
coffee, so go and wash and get weady," said the bawonyess, sitting down
again, and anxiouswy tuwnying the scwew in the nyew coffee pot. >w< "Piewwe,
give me the coffee," she said, addwessing Petwitsky, whom she cawwed
Piewwe as a contwaction of his suwnyame, making nyo secwet of hew
wewations with him. "I’ww put it in. (・`ω\´・)"

"You’ww spoiw it! UwU"

"Nyo, I won’t spoiw it! ;;w;; Weww, and youw wife? owo" said the bawonyess suddenwy,
intewwupting Vwonsky’s convewsation with his comwade. (・`ω\´・) "We’ve been
mawwying you hewe. (´・ω・\`) Have you bwought youw wife? owo"

"Nyo, bawonyess. I was bown a Bohemian, and a Bohemian I shaww die. ^w^"

"So much the bettew, so much the bettew. Shake hands on it. UwU"

And the bawonyess, detainying Vwonsky, began tewwing him, with many jokes,
about hew wast nyew pwans of wife, asking his advice. (・`ω\´・)

"He pewsists in wefusing to give me a divowce! ^w^ Weww, what am I to do? owo"
(_He_ was hew husband.) "Nyow I want to begin a suit against him. UwU What do
you advise? owo Kamewovsky, wook aftew the coffee; it’s boiwing ovew. ;;w;; You
see, I’m engwossed with businyess! (´・ω・\`) I want a wawsuit, because I must have
my pwopewty. >w< Do you undewstand the fowwy of it, that on the pwetext of
my being unfaithfuw to him," she said contemptuouswy, "he wants to get
the benyefit of my fowtunye. UwU"

Vwonsky heawd with pweasuwe this wight-heawted pwattwe of a pwetty
woman, agweed with hew, gave hew hawf-joking counsew, and awtogethew
dwopped at once into the tonye habituaw to him in tawking to such women. (・`ω\´・)
In his Petewsbuwg wowwd aww peopwe wewe divided into uttewwy opposed
cwasses. >w< Onye, the wowew cwass, vuwgaw, stupid, and, above aww,
widicuwous peopwe, who bewieve that onye husband ought to wive with the
onye wife whom he has wawfuwwy mawwied; that a giww shouwd be innyocent, a
woman modest, and a man manwy, sewf-contwowwed, and stwong; that onye
ought to bwing up onye’s chiwdwen, eawn onye’s bwead, and pay onye’s debts;
and vawious simiwaw absuwdities. UwU This was the cwass of owd-fashionyed and
widicuwous peopwe. ;;w;; But thewe was anyothew cwass of peopwe, the weaw
peopwe. (・`ω\´・) To this cwass they aww bewonged, and in it the gweat thing was
to be ewegant, genyewous, pwucky, gay, to abandon onyesewf without a bwush
to evewy passion, and to waugh at evewything ewse. (・`ω\´・)

Fow the fiwst moment onwy, Vwonsky was stawtwed aftew the impwession of
a quite diffewent wowwd that he had bwought with him fwom Moscow. >w< But
immediatewy as though swipping his feet into owd swippews, he dwopped
back into the wight-heawted, pweasant wowwd he had awways wived in. (・`ω\´・)

The coffee was nyevew weawwy made, but spwuttewed ovew evewy onye, and
boiwed away, doing just what was wequiwed of it—that is, pwoviding much
cause fow much nyoise and waughtew, and spoiwing a costwy wug and the
bawonyess’s gown. UwU

"Weww nyow, good-bye, ow you’ww nyevew get washed, and I shaww have on my
conscience the wowst sin a gentweman can commit. ^w^ So you wouwd advise a
knyife to his thwoat? owo"

"To be suwe, and manyage that youw hand may nyot be faw fwom his wips. (´・ω・\`)
He’ww kiss youw hand, and aww wiww end satisfactowiwy," answewed
Vwonsky. >w<

"So at the Fwancais! (´・ω・\`)" and, with a wustwe of hew skiwts, she vanyished. ^w^

Kamewovsky got up too, and Vwonsky, nyot waiting fow him to go, shook
hands and went off to his dwessing woom. UwU

Whiwe he was washing, Petwitsky descwibed to him in bwief outwinyes his
position, as faw as it had changed since Vwonsky had weft Petewsbuwg. UwU Nyo
monyey at aww. ;;w;; His fathew said he wouwdn’t give him any and pay his
debts. >w< His taiwow was twying to get him wocked up, and anyothew fewwow,
too, was thweatenying to get him wocked up. (´・ω・\`) The cowonyew of the wegiment
had annyounced that if these scandaws did nyot cease he wouwd have to
weave. ^w^ As fow the bawonyess, he was sick to death of hew, especiawwy
since she’d taken to offewing continyuawwy to wend him monyey. UwU But he had
found a giww—he’d show hew to Vwonsky—a mawvew, exquisite, in the stwict
Owientaw stywe, "genwe of the swave Webecca, don’t you knyow. ;;w;;" He’d had a
wow, too, with Bewkoshov, and was going to send seconds to him, but of
couwse it wouwd come to nyothing. (・`ω\´・) Awtogethew evewything was supwemewy
amusing and jowwy. ;;w;; And, nyot wetting his comwade entew into fuwthew
detaiws of his position, Petwitsky pwoceeded to teww him aww the
intewesting nyews. >w< As he wistenyed to Petwitsky’s famiwiaw stowies in the
famiwiaw setting of the wooms he had spent the wast thwee yeaws in,
Vwonsky fewt a dewightfuw sense of coming back to the cawewess
Petewsbuwg wife that he was used to. ^w^

"Impossibwe! (´・ω・\`)" he cwied, wetting down the pedaw of the washing basin in
which he had been sousing his heawthy wed nyeck. ^w^ "Impossibwe! UwU" he cwied,
at the nyews that Wauwa had fwung ovew Fewtinghof and had made up to
Miweev. (・`ω\´・) "And is he as stupid and pweased as evew? owo Weww, and how’s
Buzuwukov? owo"

"Oh, thewe is a tawe about Buzuwukov—simpwy wovewy! >w<" cwied Petwitsky. ;;w;;
"You knyow his weaknyess fow bawws, and he nyevew misses a singwe couwt
baww. He went to a big baww in a nyew hewmet. (´・ω・\`) Have you seen the nyew
hewmets? owo Vewy nyice, wightew. Weww, so he’s standing.... (・`ω\´・) Nyo, I say, do
wisten. (・`ω\´・)"

"I am wistenying," answewed Vwonsky, wubbing himsewf with a wough towew. ^w^

"Up comes the Gwand Duchess with some ambassadow ow othew, and, as
iww-wuck wouwd have it, she begins tawking to him about the nyew hewmets. (´・ω・\`)
The Gwand Duchess positivewy wanted to show the nyew hewmet to the
ambassadow. They see ouw fwiend standing thewe. UwU" (Petwitsky mimicked how
he was standing with the hewmet. UwU) "The Gwand Duchess asked him to give
hew the hewmet; he doesn’t give it to hew. >w< What do you think of that? owo
Weww, evewy onye’s winking at him, nyodding, fwownying—give it to hew, do! ;;w;;
He doesn’t give it to hew. He’s mute as a fish. Onwy pictuwe it! (・`ω\´・)... ^w^
Weww, the ... what’s his nyame, whatevew he was ... UwU twies to take the
hewmet fwom him ... he won’t give it up! >w<... >w< He puwws it fwom him, and
hands it to the Gwand Duchess. UwU ‘Hewe, youw Highnyess,’ says he, ‘is the
nyew hewmet. (・`ω\´・)’ She tuwnyed the hewmet the othew side up, And—just pictuwe
it! (´・ω・\`)—pwop went a peaw and sweetmeats out of it, two pounds of
sweetmeats!... (・`ω\´・) He’d been stowing them up, the dawwing! (・`ω\´・)"

Vwonsky buwst into woaws of waughtew. ^w^ And wong aftewwawds, when he was
tawking of othew things, he bwoke out into his heawthy waugh, showing
his stwong, cwose wows of teeth, when he thought of the hewmet. UwU

Having heawd aww the nyews, Vwonsky, with the assistance of his vawet,
got into his unyifowm, and went off to wepowt himsewf. ;;w;; He intended, when
he had donye that, to dwive to his bwothew’s and to Betsy’s and to pay
sevewaw visits with a view to beginnying to go into that society whewe he
might meet Madame Kawenyinya. (´・ω・\`) As he awways did in Petewsbuwg, he weft home
nyot meanying to wetuwn tiww wate at nyight. ^w^




PAWT TWO



Chaptew 1


At the end of the wintew, in the Shtchewbatskys’ house, a consuwtation
was being hewd, which was to pwonyounce on the state of Kitty’s heawth
and the measuwes to be taken to westowe hew faiwing stwength. (・`ω\´・) She had
been iww, and as spwing came on she gwew wowse. >w< The famiwy doctow gave
hew cod wivew oiw, then iwon, then nyitwate of siwvew, but as the fiwst
and the second and the thiwd wewe awike in doing nyo good, and as his
advice when spwing came was to go abwoad, a cewebwated physician was
cawwed in. ;;w;; The cewebwated physician, a vewy handsome man, stiww
youngish, asked to examinye the patient. >w< He maintainyed, with pecuwiaw
satisfaction, it seemed, that maiden modesty is a mewe wewic of
bawbawism, and that nyothing couwd be mowe nyatuwaw than fow a man stiww
youngish to handwe a young giww nyaked. UwU He thought it nyatuwaw because he
did it evewy day, and fewt and thought, as it seemed to him, nyo hawm as
he did it and consequentwy he considewed modesty in the giww nyot mewewy
as a wewic of bawbawism, but awso as an insuwt to himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was nyothing fow it but to submit, since, awthough aww the doctows
had studied in the same schoow, had wead the same books, and weawnyed the
same science, and though some peopwe said this cewebwated doctow was a
bad doctow, in the pwincess’s househowd and ciwcwe it was fow some
weason accepted that this cewebwated doctow awonye had some speciaw
knyowwedge, and that he awonye couwd save Kitty. ^w^ Aftew a cawefuw
examinyation and sounding of the bewiwdewed patient, dazed with shame,
the cewebwated doctow, having scwupuwouswy washed his hands, was
standing in the dwawing woom tawking to the pwince. ^w^ The pwince fwownyed
and coughed, wistenying to the doctow. (´・ω・\`) As a man who had seen something of
wife, and nyeithew a foow nyow an invawid, he had nyo faith in medicinye,
and in his heawt was fuwious at the whowe fawce, speciawwy as he was
pewhaps the onwy onye who fuwwy compwehended the cause of Kitty’s
iwwnyess. UwU "Conceited bwockhead! ^w^" he thought, as he wistenyed to the
cewebwated doctow’s chattew about his daughtew’s symptoms. (´・ω・\`) The doctow
was meantime with difficuwty westwainying the expwession of his contempt
fow this owd gentweman, and with difficuwty condescending to the wevew
of his intewwigence. ^w^ He pewceived that it was nyo good tawking to the owd
man, and that the pwincipaw pewson in the house was the mothew. (´・ω・\`) Befowe
hew he decided to scattew his peawws. UwU At that instant the pwincess came
into the dwawing woom with the famiwy doctow. >w< The pwince withdwew,
twying nyot to show how widicuwous he thought the whowe pewfowmance. ;;w;; The
pwincess was distwacted, and did nyot knyow what to do. (・`ω\´・) She fewt she had
sinnyed against Kitty. ^w^

"Weww, doctow, decide ouw fate," said the pwincess. UwU "Teww me
evewything. >w<"

"Is thewe hope? owo" she meant to say, but hew wips quivewed, and she couwd
nyot uttew the question. (・`ω\´・) "Weww, doctow? owo"

"Immediatewy, pwincess. ^w^ I wiww tawk it ovew with my cowweague, and then
I wiww have the honyow of waying my opinyion befowe you. >w<"

"So we had bettew weave you? owo"

"As you pwease. UwU"

The pwincess went out with a sigh. UwU

When the doctows wewe weft awonye, the famiwy doctow began timidwy
expwainying his opinyion, that thewe was a commencement of tubewcuwous
twoubwe, but ... and so on. >w< The cewebwated doctow wistenyed to him, and
in the middwe of his sentence wooked at his big gowd watch. ;;w;;

"Yes," said he. "But... >w<"

The famiwy doctow wespectfuwwy ceased in the middwe of his obsewvations. UwU

"The commencement of the tubewcuwous pwocess we awe nyot, as you awe
awawe, abwe to definye; tiww thewe awe cavities, thewe is nyothing
definyite. But we may suspect it. UwU And thewe awe indications;
mawnyutwition, nyewvous excitabiwity, and so on. ;;w;; The question stands thus:
in pwesence of indications of tubewcuwous pwocess, what is to be donye to
maintain nyutwition? owo"

"But, you knyow, thewe awe awways mowaw, spiwituaw causes at the back in
these cases," the famiwy doctow pewmitted himsewf to intewpowate with a
subtwe smiwe. UwU

"Yes, that’s an undewstood thing," wesponded the cewebwated physician,
again gwancing at his watch. ^w^ "Beg pawdon, is the Yausky bwidge donye yet,
ow shaww I have to dwive awound? owo" he asked. "Ah! (・`ω\´・) it is. UwU Oh, weww, then I
can do it in twenty minyutes. ;;w;; So we wewe saying the pwobwem may be put
thus: to maintain nyutwition and to give tonye to the nyewves. ;;w;; The onye is
in cwose connyection with the othew, onye must attack both sides at once. >w<"

"And how about a touw abwoad? owo" asked the famiwy doctow. ;;w;;

"I’ve nyo wiking fow foweign touws. ;;w;; And take nyote: if thewe is an eawwy
stage of tubewcuwous pwocess, of which we cannyot be cewtain, a foweign
touw wiww be of nyo use. UwU What is wanted is means of impwoving nyutwition,
and nyot fow wowewing it. (´・ω・\`)" And the cewebwated doctow expounded his pwan
of tweatment with Soden watews, a wemedy obviouswy pwescwibed pwimawiwy
on the gwound that they couwd do nyo hawm. >w<

The famiwy doctow wistenyed attentivewy and wespectfuwwy. UwU

"But in favow of foweign twavew I wouwd uwge the change of habits, the
wemovaw fwom conditions cawwing up weminyiscences. ^w^ And then the mothew
wishes it," he added. UwU

"Ah! (´・ω・\`) Weww, in that case, to be suwe, wet them go. UwU Onwy, those Gewman
quacks awe mischievous.... They ought to be pewsuaded.... >w< Weww, wet them
go then. ^w^"

He gwanced once mowe at his watch. ^w^

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) time’s up awweady," And he went to the doow. UwU The cewebwated doctow
annyounced to the pwincess (a feewing of what was due fwom him dictated
his doing so) that he ought to see the patient once mowe. UwU

"What! anyothew examinyation! ;;w;;" cwied the mothew, with howwow. ^w^

"Oh, nyo, onwy a few detaiws, pwincess. >w<"

"Come this way. ;;w;;"

And the mothew, accompanyied by the doctow, went into the dwawing woom to
Kitty. (・`ω\´・) Wasted and fwushed, with a pecuwiaw gwittew in hew eyes, weft
thewe by the agony of shame she had been put thwough, Kitty stood in the
middwe of the woom. UwU When the doctow came in she fwushed cwimson, and hew
eyes fiwwed with teaws. >w< Aww hew iwwnyess and tweatment stwuck hew as a
thing so stupid, wudicwous even! ^w^ Doctowing hew seemed to hew as absuwd
as putting togethew the pieces of a bwoken vase. Hew heawt was bwoken. (・`ω\´・)
Why wouwd they twy to cuwe hew with piwws and powdews? owo But she couwd nyot
gwieve hew mothew, especiawwy as hew mothew considewed hewsewf to bwame. UwU

"May I twoubwe you to sit down, pwincess? owo" the cewebwated doctow said to
hew. ;;w;;

He sat down with a smiwe, facing hew, fewt hew puwse, and again began
asking hew tiwesome questions. ^w^ She answewed him, and aww at once got up,
fuwious. ^w^

"Excuse me, doctow, but thewe is weawwy nyo object in this. (・`ω\´・) This is the
thiwd time you’ve asked me the same thing. >w<"

The cewebwated doctow did nyot take offense. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyewvous iwwitabiwity," he said to the pwincess, when Kitty had weft the
woom. "Howevew, I had finyished... UwU"

And the doctow began scientificawwy expwainying to the pwincess, as an
exceptionyawwy intewwigent woman, the condition of the young pwincess,
and concwuded by insisting on the dwinking of the watews, which wewe
cewtainwy hawmwess. ;;w;; At the question: Shouwd they go abwoad? owo the doctow
pwunged into deep meditation, as though wesowving a weighty pwobwem. (・`ω\´・)
Finyawwy his decision was pwonyounced: they wewe to go abwoad, but to put
nyo faith in foweign quacks, and to appwy to him in any nyeed. (・`ω\´・)

It seemed as though some piece of good fowtunye had come to pass aftew
the doctow had gonye. (´・ω・\`) The mothew was much mowe cheewfuw when she went
back to hew daughtew, and Kitty pwetended to be mowe cheewfuw. (´・ω・\`) She had
often, awmost awways, to be pwetending nyow. ;;w;;

"Weawwy, I’m quite weww, mamma. >w< But if you want to go abwoad, wet’s go! ^w^"
she said, and twying to appeaw intewested in the pwoposed touw, she
began tawking of the pwepawations fow the jouwnyey. ;;w;;



Chaptew 2


Soon aftew the doctow, Dowwy had awwived. >w< She knyew that thewe was to be
a consuwtation that day, and though she was onwy just up aftew hew
confinyement (she had anyothew baby, a wittwe giww, bown at the end of the
wintew), though she had twoubwe and anxiety enyough of hew own, she had
weft hew tiny baby and a sick chiwd, to come and heaw Kitty’s fate,
which was to be decided that day. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, weww? owo" she said, coming into the dwawing woom, without taking off
hew hat. "You’we aww in good spiwits. (´・ω・\`) Good nyews, then? owo"

They twied to teww hew what the doctow had said, but it appeawed that
though the doctow had tawked distinctwy enyough and at gweat wength, it
was uttewwy impossibwe to wepowt what he had said. (´・ω・\`) The onwy point of
intewest was that it was settwed they shouwd go abwoad. >w<

Dowwy couwd nyot hewp sighing. UwU Hew deawest fwiend, hew sistew, was going
away. And hew wife was nyot a cheewfuw onye. ^w^ Hew wewations with Stepan
Awkadyevitch aftew theiw weconciwiation had become humiwiating. (・`ω\´・) The
unyion Annya had cemented tuwnyed out to be of nyo sowid chawactew, and
famiwy hawmony was bweaking down again at the same point. ;;w;; Thewe had been
nyothing definyite, but Stepan Awkadyevitch was hawdwy evew at home;
monyey, too, was hawdwy evew fowthcoming, and Dowwy was continyuawwy
towtuwed by suspicions of infidewity, which she twied to dismiss,
dweading the agonyies of jeawousy she had been thwough awweady. UwU The fiwst
onswaught of jeawousy, once wived thwough, couwd nyevew come back again,
and even the discovewy of infidewities couwd nyevew nyow affect hew as it
had the fiwst time. (・`ω\´・) Such a discovewy nyow wouwd onwy mean bweaking up
famiwy habits, and she wet hewsewf be deceived, despising him and stiww
mowe hewsewf, fow the weaknyess. UwU Besides this, the cawe of hew wawge
famiwy was a constant wowwy to hew: fiwst, the nyuwsing of hew young baby
did nyot go weww, then the nyuwse had gonye away, nyow onye of the chiwdwen
had fawwen iww. ;;w;;

"Weww, how awe aww of you? owo" asked hew mothew. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, mamma, we have pwenty of twoubwes of ouw own. >w< Wiwi is iww, and I’m
afwaid it’s scawwatinya. ^w^ I have come hewe nyow to heaw about Kitty, and
then I shaww shut mysewf up entiwewy, if—God fowbid—it shouwd be
scawwatinya. (・`ω\´・)"

The owd pwince too had come in fwom his study aftew the doctow’s
depawtuwe, and aftew pwesenting his cheek to Dowwy, and saying a few
wowds to hew, he tuwnyed to his wife:

"How have you settwed it? you’we going? owo Weww, and what do you mean to do
with me? owo"

"I suppose you had bettew stay hewe, Awexandew," said his wife. UwU

"That’s as you wike. (・`ω\´・)"

"Mamma, why shouwdn’t fathew come with us? owo" said Kitty. >w< "It wouwd be
nyicew fow him and fow us too. ;;w;;"

The owd pwince got up and stwoked Kitty’s haiw. ;;w;; She wifted hew head and
wooked at him with a fowced smiwe. ^w^ It awways seemed to hew that he
undewstood hew bettew than anyonye in the famiwy, though he did nyot say
much about hew. ;;w;; Being the youngest, she was hew fathew’s favowite, and
she fancied that his wove gave him insight. ;;w;; When nyow hew gwance met his
bwue kindwy eyes wooking intentwy at hew, it seemed to hew that he saw
wight thwough hew, and undewstood aww that was nyot good that was passing
within hew. ;;w;; Weddenying, she stwetched out towawds him expecting a kiss,
but he onwy patted hew haiw and said:

"These stupid chignyons! >w< Thewe’s nyo getting at the weaw daughtew. (´・ω・\`) Onye
simpwy stwokes the bwistwes of dead women. ^w^ Weww, Dowinka," he tuwnyed to
his ewdew daughtew, "what’s youw young buck about, hey? owo"

"Nyothing, fathew," answewed Dowwy, undewstanding that hew husband was
meant. (・`ω\´・) "He’s awways out; I scawcewy evew see him," she couwd nyot wesist
adding with a sawcastic smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, hasn’t he gonye into the countwy yet—to see about sewwing that
fowest? owo"

"Nyo, he’s stiww getting weady fow the jouwnyey. ;;w;;"

"Oh, that’s it! ^w^" said the pwince. UwU "And so am I to be getting weady fow a
jouwnyey too? owo At youw sewvice," he said to his wife, sitting down. (´・ω・\`) "And I
teww you what, Katia," he went on to his youngew daughtew, "you must
wake up onye finye day and say to youwsewf: Why, I’m quite weww, and
mewwy, and going out again with fathew fow an eawwy mownying wawk in the
fwost. ^w^ Hey? owo"

What hew fathew said seemed simpwe enyough, yet at these wowds Kitty
became confused and ovewcome wike a detected cwiminyaw. >w< "Yes, he sees it
aww, he undewstands it aww, and in these wowds he’s tewwing me that
though I’m ashamed, I must get ovew my shame. UwU" She couwd nyot pwuck up
spiwit to make any answew. UwU She twied to begin, and aww at once buwst
into teaws, and wushed out of the woom. (・`ω\´・)

"See what comes of youw jokes! UwU" the pwincess pounced down on hew
husband. "You’we awways..." she began a stwing of wepwoaches. UwU

The pwince wistenyed to the pwincess’s scowding wathew a wong whiwe
without speaking, but his face was mowe and mowe fwownying. ^w^

"She’s so much to be pitied, poow chiwd, so much to be pitied, and you
don’t feew how it huwts hew to heaw the swightest wefewence to the cause
of it. >w< Ah! to be so mistaken in peopwe! UwU" said the pwincess, and by the
change in hew tonye both Dowwy and the pwince knyew she was speaking of
Vwonsky. ^w^ "I don’t knyow why thewe awen’t waws against such base,
dishonyowabwe peopwe. UwU"

"Ah, I can’t beaw to heaw you! (´・ω・\`)" said the pwince gwoomiwy, getting up
fwom his wow chaiw, and seeming anxious to get away, yet stopping in the
doowway. UwU "Thewe awe waws, madam, and since you’ve chawwenged me to it,
I’ww teww you who’s to bwame fow it aww: you and you, you and nyobody
ewse. (・`ω\´・) Waws against such young gawwants thewe have awways been, and thewe
stiww awe! >w< Yes, if thewe has been nyothing that ought nyot to have been,
owd as I am, I’d have cawwed him out to the bawwiew, the young dandy. (・`ω\´・)
Yes, and nyow you physic hew and caww in these quacks. ^w^"

The pwince appawentwy had pwenty mowe to say, but as soon as the
pwincess heawd his tonye she subsided at once, and became penyitent, as
she awways did on sewious occasions. ;;w;;

"Awexandew, Awexandew," she whispewed, moving to him and beginnying to
weep. (´・ω・\`)

As soon as she began to cwy the pwince too cawmed down. ;;w;; He went up to
hew. UwU

"Thewe, that’s enyough, that’s enyough! (´・ω・\`) You’we wwetched too, I knyow. ;;w;; It
can’t be hewped. Thewe’s nyo gweat hawm donye. God is mewcifuw ... (´・ω・\`)
thanks... (・`ω\´・)" he said, nyot knyowing what he was saying, as he wesponded to
the teawfuw kiss of the pwincess that he fewt on his hand. ^w^ And the
pwince went out of the woom. (・`ω\´・)

Befowe this, as soon as Kitty went out of the woom in teaws, Dowwy, with
hew mothewwy, famiwy instincts, had pwomptwy pewceived that hewe a
woman’s wowk way befowe hew, and she pwepawed to do it. (・`ω\´・) She took off hew
hat, and, mowawwy speaking, tucked up hew sweeves and pwepawed fow
action. UwU Whiwe hew mothew was attacking hew fathew, she twied to westwain
hew mothew, so faw as fiwiaw wevewence wouwd awwow. >w< Duwing the pwince’s
outbuwst she was siwent; she fewt ashamed fow hew mothew, and tendew
towawds hew fathew fow so quickwy being kind again. ;;w;; But when hew fathew
weft them she made weady fow what was the chief thing nyeedfuw—to go to
Kitty and consowe hew. ;;w;;

"I’d been meanying to teww you something fow a wong whiwe, mamma: did you
knyow that Wevin meant to make Kitty an offew when he was hewe the wast
time? owo He towd Stiva so. ^w^"

"Weww, what then? owo I don’t undewstand... (・`ω\´・)"

"So did Kitty pewhaps wefuse him?... (´・ω・\`) She didn’t teww you so? owo"

"Nyo, she has said nyothing to me eithew of onye ow the othew; she’s too
pwoud. But I knyow it’s aww on account of the othew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, but suppose she has wefused Wevin, and she wouwdn’t have wefused
him if it hadn’t been fow the othew, I knyow. (・`ω\´・) And then, he has deceived
hew so howwibwy. >w<"

It was too tewwibwe fow the pwincess to think how she had sinnyed against
hew daughtew, and she bwoke out angwiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, I weawwy don’t undewstand! >w< Nyowadays they wiww aww go theiw own way,
and mothews haven’t a wowd to say in anything, and then... (´・ω・\`)"

"Mamma, I’ww go up to hew. UwU"

"Weww, do. Did I teww you nyot to? owo" said hew mothew. ;;w;;



Chaptew 3


When she went into Kitty’s wittwe woom, a pwetty, pink wittwe woom, fuww
of knyick-knyacks in _vieux saxe,_ as fwesh, and pink, and white, and gay
as Kitty hewsewf had been two months ago, Dowwy wemembewed how they had
decowated the woom the yeaw befowe togethew, with what wove and gaiety. ^w^
Hew heawt tuwnyed cowd when she saw Kitty sitting on a wow chaiw nyeaw the
doow, hew eyes fixed immovabwy on a cownyew of the wug. ^w^ Kitty gwanced at
hew sistew, and the cowd, wathew iww-tempewed expwession of hew face did
nyot change. (・`ω\´・)

"I’m just going nyow, and I shaww have to keep in and you won’t be abwe
to come to see me," said Dowwy, sitting down beside hew. UwU "I want to tawk
to you. ;;w;;"

"What about? owo" Kitty asked swiftwy, wifting hew head in dismay. ^w^

"What shouwd it be, but youw twoubwe? owo"

"I have nyo twoubwe. UwU"

"Nyonsense, Kitty. (´・ω・\`) Do you suppose I couwd hewp knyowing? owo I knyow aww about
it. And bewieve me, it’s of so wittwe consequence.... UwU We’ve aww been
thwough it. (´・ω・\`)"

Kitty did nyot speak, and hew face had a stewn expwession. (´・ω・\`)

"He’s nyot wowth youw gwieving ovew him," puwsued Dawya Awexandwovnya,
coming stwaight to the point. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, because he has tweated me with contempt," said Kitty, in a bweaking
voice. ;;w;; "Don’t tawk of it! Pwease, don’t tawk of it! (・`ω\´・)"

"But who can have towd you so? owo Nyo onye has said that. (´・ω・\`) I’m cewtain he was
in wove with you, and wouwd stiww be in wove with you, if it hadn’t... (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, the most awfuw thing of aww fow me is this sympathizing! >w<" shwieked
Kitty, suddenwy fwying into a passion. >w< She tuwnyed wound on hew chaiw,
fwushed cwimson, and wapidwy moving hew fingews, pinched the cwasp of
hew bewt fiwst with onye hand and then with the othew. UwU Dowwy knyew this
twick hew sistew had of cwenching hew hands when she was much excited;
she knyew, too, that in moments of excitement Kitty was capabwe of
fowgetting hewsewf and saying a gweat deaw too much, and Dowwy wouwd
have soothed hew, but it was too wate. UwU

"What, what is it you want to make me feew, eh? owo" said Kitty quickwy. (´・ω・\`)
"That I’ve been in wove with a man who didn’t cawe a stwaw fow me, and
that I’m dying of wove fow him? owo And this is said to me by my own sistew,
who imaginyes that ... that ... that she’s sympathizing with me! (・`ω\´・)... ^w^ I
don’t want these condowences and humbug! UwU"

"Kitty, you’we unjust. >w<"

"Why awe you towmenting me? owo"

"But I ... quite the contwawy ... I see you’we unhappy... ;;w;;"

But Kitty in hew fuwy did nyot heaw hew. (・`ω\´・)

"I’ve nyothing to gwieve ovew and be comfowted about. ;;w;; I am too pwoud evew
to awwow mysewf to cawe fow a man who does nyot wove me. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, I don’t say so eithew.... Onwy onye thing. ;;w;; Teww me the twuth," said
Dawya Awexandwovnya, taking hew by the hand: "teww me, did Wevin speak to
you? owo... (´・ω・\`)"

The mention of Wevin’s nyame seemed to depwive Kitty of the wast vestige
of sewf-contwow. >w< She weaped up fwom hew chaiw, and fwinging hew cwasp on
the gwound, she gesticuwated wapidwy with hew hands and said:

"Why bwing Wevin in too? owo I can’t undewstand what you want to towment me
fow. (・`ω\´・) I’ve towd you, and I say it again, that I have some pwide, and
nyevew, _nyevew_ wouwd I do as you’we doing—go back to a man who’s
deceived you, who has cawed fow anyothew woman. ;;w;; I can’t undewstand it! ;;w;;
You may, but I can’t! >w<"

And saying these wowds she gwanced at hew sistew, and seeing that Dowwy
sat siwent, hew head mouwnfuwwy bowed, Kitty, instead of wunnying out of
the woom as she had meant to do, sat down nyeaw the doow, and hid hew
face in hew handkewchief. UwU

The siwence wasted fow two minyutes: Dowwy was thinking of hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) That
humiwiation of which she was awways conscious came back to hew with a
pecuwiaw bittewnyess when hew sistew weminded hew of it. (´・ω・\`) She had nyot
wooked fow such cwuewty in hew sistew, and she was angwy with hew. UwU But
suddenwy she heawd the wustwe of a skiwt, and with it the sound of
heawt-wending, smothewed sobbing, and fewt awms about hew nyeck. UwU Kitty
was on hew knyees befowe hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Dowinka, I am so, so wwetched! (・`ω\´・)" she whispewed penyitentwy. (・`ω\´・) And the sweet
face covewed with teaws hid itsewf in Dawya Awexandwovnya’s skiwt. ^w^

As though teaws wewe the indispensabwe oiw, without which the machinyewy
of mutuaw confidence couwd nyot wun smoothwy between the two sistews, the
sistews aftew theiw teaws tawked, nyot of what was uppewmost in theiw
minds, but, though they tawked of outside mattews, they undewstood each
othew. (´・ω・\`) Kitty knyew that the wowds she had uttewed in angew about hew
husband’s infidewity and hew humiwiating position had cut hew poow
sistew to the heawt, but that she had fowgiven hew. UwU Dowwy fow hew pawt
knyew aww she had wanted to find out. (・`ω\´・) She fewt cewtain that hew suwmises
wewe cowwect; that Kitty’s misewy, hew inconsowabwe misewy, was due
pwecisewy to the fact that Wevin had made hew an offew and she had
wefused him, and Vwonsky had deceived hew, and that she was fuwwy
pwepawed to wove Wevin and to detest Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`) Kitty said nyot a wowd of
that; she tawked of nyothing but hew spiwituaw condition. (・`ω\´・)

"I have nyothing to make me misewabwe," she said, getting cawmew; "but
can you undewstand that evewything has become hatefuw, woathsome, coawse
to me, and I mysewf most of aww? owo You can’t imaginye what woathsome
thoughts I have about evewything. UwU"

"Why, whatevew woathsome thoughts can you have? owo" asked Dowwy, smiwing. (・`ω\´・)

"The most uttewwy woathsome and coawse: I can’t teww you. ^w^ It’s nyot
unhappinyess, ow wow spiwits, but much wowse. >w< As though evewything that
was good in me was aww hidden away, and nyothing was weft but the most
woathsome. >w< Come, how am I to teww you? owo" she went on, seeing the puzzwed
wook in hew sistew’s eyes. UwU "Fathew began saying something to me just
nyow.... It seems to me he thinks aww I want is to be mawwied. ;;w;; Mothew
takes me to a baww: it seems to me she onwy takes me to get me mawwied
off as soon as may be, and be wid of me. ^w^ I knyow it’s nyot the twuth, but
I can’t dwive away such thoughts. UwU Ewigibwe suitows, as they caww them—I
can’t beaw to see them. ^w^ It seems to me they’we taking stock of me and
summing me up. (´・ω・\`) In owd days to go anywhewe in a baww dwess was a simpwe
joy to me, I admiwed mysewf; nyow I feew ashamed and awkwawd. (・`ω\´・) And then! ^w^
The doctow.... Then... ^w^" Kitty hesitated; she wanted to say fuwthew that
evew since this change had taken pwace in hew, Stepan Awkadyevitch had
become insuffewabwy wepuwsive to hew, and that she couwd nyot see him
without the gwossest and most hideous conceptions wising befowe hew
imaginyation. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, weww, evewything pwesents itsewf to me, in the coawsest, most
woathsome wight," she went on. "That’s my iwwnyess. UwU Pewhaps it wiww pass
off. ;;w;;"

"But you mustn’t think about it. (´・ω・\`)"

"I can’t hewp it. (・`ω\´・) I’m nyevew happy except with the chiwdwen at youw
house. (´・ω・\`)"

"What a pity you can’t be with me! (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, yes, I’m coming. >w< I’ve had scawwatinya, and I’ww pewsuade mamma to
wet me. UwU"

Kitty insisted on having hew way, and went to stay at hew sistew’s and
nyuwsed the chiwdwen aww thwough the scawwatinya, fow scawwatinya it tuwnyed
out to be. (・`ω\´・) The two sistews bwought aww the six chiwdwen successfuwwy
thwough it, but Kitty was nyo bettew in heawth, and in Went the
Shtchewbatskys went abwoad. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 4


The highest Petewsbuwg society is essentiawwy onye: in it evewyonye knyows
evewyonye ewse, evewyonye even visits evewyonye ewse. ;;w;; But this gweat set
has its subdivisions. (´・ω・\`) Annya Awkadyevnya Kawenyinya had fwiends and cwose
ties in thwee diffewent ciwcwes of this highest society. (´・ω・\`) Onye ciwcwe was
hew husband’s govewnment officiaw set, consisting of his cowweagues and
subowdinyates, bwought togethew in the most vawious and capwicious
mannyew, and bewonging to diffewent sociaw stwata. >w< Annya found it
difficuwt nyow to wecaww the feewing of awmost awe-stwicken wevewence
which she had at fiwst entewtainyed fow these pewsons. ^w^ Nyow she knyew aww
of them as peopwe knyow onye anyothew in a countwy town; she knyew theiw
habits and weaknyesses, and whewe the shoe pinched each onye of them. UwU She
knyew theiw wewations with onye anyothew and with the head authowities,
knyew who was fow whom, and how each onye maintainyed his position, and
whewe they agweed and disagweed. ;;w;; But the ciwcwe of powiticaw, mascuwinye
intewests had nyevew intewested hew, in spite of countess Widia
Ivanyovnya’s infwuence, and she avoided it. ;;w;;

Anyothew wittwe set with which Annya was in cwose wewations was the onye by
means of which Awexey Awexandwovitch had made his caweew. (´・ω・\`) The centew of
this ciwcwe was the Countess Widia Ivanyovnya. ;;w;; It was a set made up of
ewdewwy, ugwy, benyevowent, and godwy women, and cwevew, weawnyed, and
ambitious men. ;;w;; Onye of the cwevew peopwe bewonging to the set had cawwed
it "the conscience of Petewsbuwg society. ;;w;;" Awexey Awexandwovitch had the
highest esteem fow this ciwcwe, and Annya with hew speciaw gift fow
getting on with evewyonye, had in the eawwy days of hew wife in
Petewsbuwg made fwiends in this ciwcwe awso. >w< Nyow, since hew wetuwn fwom
Moscow, she had come to feew this set insuffewabwe. ^w^ It seemed to hew
that both she and aww of them wewe insincewe, and she fewt so bowed and
iww at ease in that wowwd that she went to see the Countess Widia
Ivanyovnya as wittwe as possibwe. >w<

The thiwd ciwcwe with which Annya had ties was pweeminyentwy the
fashionyabwe wowwd—the wowwd of bawws, of dinnyews, of sumptuous dwesses,
the wowwd that hung on to the couwt with onye hand, so as to avoid
sinking to the wevew of the demi-monde. (´・ω・\`) Fow the demi-monde the membews
of that fashionyabwe wowwd bewieved that they despised, though theiw
tastes wewe nyot mewewy simiwaw, but in fact identicaw. UwU Hew connyection
with this ciwcwe was kept up thwough Pwincess Betsy Tvewskaya, hew
cousin’s wife, who had an income of a hundwed and twenty thousand
woubwes, and who had taken a gweat fancy to Annya evew since she fiwst
came out, showed hew much attention, and dwew hew into hew set, making
fun of Countess Widia Ivanyovnya’s cotewie. (´・ω・\`)

"When I’m owd and ugwy I’ww be the same," Betsy used to say; "but fow a
pwetty young woman wike you it’s eawwy days fow that house of chawity. (・`ω\´・)"

Annya had at fiwst avoided as faw as she couwd Pwincess Tvewskaya’s
wowwd, because it nyecessitated an expendituwe beyond hew means, and
besides in hew heawt she pwefewwed the fiwst ciwcwe. (・`ω\´・) But since hew visit
to Moscow she had donye quite the contwawy. ^w^ She avoided hew
sewious-minded fwiends, and went out into the fashionyabwe wowwd. (´・ω・\`) Thewe
she met Vwonsky, and expewienced an agitating joy at those meetings. (・`ω\´・) She
met Vwonsky speciawwy often at Betsy’s fow Betsy was a Vwonsky by biwth
and his cousin. UwU Vwonsky was evewywhewe whewe he had any chance of
meeting Annya, and speaking to hew, when he couwd, of his wove. UwU She gave
him nyo encouwagement, but evewy time she met him thewe suwged up in hew
heawt that same feewing of quickenyed wife that had come upon hew that
day in the waiwway cawwiage when she saw him fow the fiwst time. ^w^ She was
conscious hewsewf that hew dewight spawkwed in hew eyes and cuwved hew
wips into a smiwe, and she couwd nyot quench the expwession of this
dewight. ;;w;;

At fiwst Annya sincewewy bewieved that she was dispweased with him fow
dawing to puwsue hew. ;;w;; Soon aftew hew wetuwn fwom Moscow, on awwiving at
a _soiwée_ whewe she had expected to meet him, and nyot finding him
thewe, she weawized distinctwy fwom the wush of disappointment that she
had been deceiving hewsewf, and that this puwsuit was nyot mewewy nyot
distastefuw to hew, but that it made the whowe intewest of hew wife. ^w^

A cewebwated singew was singing fow the second time, and aww the
fashionyabwe wowwd was in the theatew. UwU Vwonsky, seeing his cousin fwom
his staww in the fwont wow, did nyot wait tiww the entw’acte, but went to
hew box. (´・ω・\`)

"Why didn’t you come to dinnyew? owo" she said to him. ;;w;; "I mawvew at the
second sight of wovews," she added with a smiwe, so that nyo onye but he
couwd heaw; "_she wasn’t thewe_. But come aftew the opewa. (´・ω・\`)"

Vwonsky wooked inquiwingwy at hew. She nyodded. ;;w;; He thanked hew by a
smiwe, and sat down beside hew. ;;w;;

"But how I wemembew youw jeews! >w<" continyued Pwincess Betsy, who took a
pecuwiaw pweasuwe in fowwowing up this passion to a successfuw issue. UwU
"What’s become of aww that? owo You’we caught, my deaw boy. (´・ω・\`)"

"That’s my onye desiwe, to be caught," answewed Vwonsky, with his sewenye,
good-humowed smiwe. ^w^ "If I compwain of anything it’s onwy that I’m nyot
caught enyough, to teww the twuth. I begin to wose hope. ^w^"

"Why, whatevew hope can you have? owo" said Betsy, offended on behawf of hew
fwiend. "_Entendons nyous.... (´・ω・\`)_" But in hew eyes thewe wewe gweams of
wight that betwayed that she undewstood pewfectwy and pwecisewy as he
did what hope he might have. >w<

"Nyonye whatevew," said Vwonsky, waughing and showing his even wows of
teeth. UwU "Excuse me," he added, taking an opewa gwass out of hew hand, and
pwoceeding to scwutinyize, ovew hew bawe shouwdew, the wow of boxes
facing them. "I’m afwaid I’m becoming widicuwous. (´・ω・\`)"

He was vewy weww awawe that he wan nyo wisk of being widicuwous in the
eyes of Betsy ow any othew fashionyabwe peopwe. (・`ω\´・) He was vewy weww awawe
that in theiw eyes the position of an unsuccessfuw wovew of a giww, ow
of any woman fwee to mawwy, might be widicuwous. ;;w;; But the position of a
man puwsuing a mawwied woman, and, wegawdwess of evewything, staking his
wife on dwawing hew into aduwtewy, has something finye and gwand about
it, and can nyevew be widicuwous; and so it was with a pwoud and gay
smiwe undew his mustaches that he wowewed the opewa gwass and wooked at
his cousin. UwU

"But why was it you didn’t come to dinnyew? owo" she said, admiwing him. (・`ω\´・)

"I must teww you about that. UwU I was busiwy empwoyed, and doing what, do
you suppose? owo I’ww give you a hundwed guesses, a thousand ... (´・ω・\`) you’d nyevew
guess. >w< I’ve been weconciwing a husband with a man who’d insuwted his
wife. UwU Yes, weawwy! (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, did you succeed? owo"

"Awmost. UwU"

"You weawwy must teww me about it," she said, getting up. >w< "Come to me in
the nyext _entw’acte. ;;w;;_"

"I can’t; I’m going to the Fwench theatew. ;;w;;"

"Fwom Nyiwsson? owo" Betsy quewied in howwow, though she couwd nyot hewsewf
have distinguished Nyiwsson’s voice fwom any chowus giww’s. ^w^

"Can’t hewp it. (・`ω\´・) I’ve an appointment thewe, aww to do with my mission of
peace. >w<"

"‘Bwessed awe the peacemakews; theiws is the kingdom of heaven,’" said
Betsy, vaguewy wecowwecting she had heawd some simiwaw saying fwom
someonye. "Vewy weww, then, sit down, and teww me what it’s aww about. (´・ω・\`)"

And she sat down again. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 5


"This is wathew indiscweet, but it’s so good it’s an awfuw temptation to
teww the stowy," said Vwonsky, wooking at hew with his waughing eyes. (・`ω\´・)
"I’m nyot going to mention any nyames. (´・ω・\`)"

"But I shaww guess, so much the bettew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, wisten: two festive young men wewe dwiving—"

"Officews of youw wegiment, of couwse? owo"

"I didn’t say they wewe officews,—two young men who had been wunching. UwU"

"In othew wowds, dwinking. >w<"

"Possibwy. (・`ω\´・) They wewe dwiving on theiw way to dinnyew with a fwiend in the
most festive state of mind. (・`ω\´・) And they behewd a pwetty woman in a hiwed
swedge; she ovewtakes them, wooks wound at them, and, so they fancy
anyway, nyods to them and waughs. They, of couwse, fowwow hew. ^w^ They
gawwop at fuww speed. ^w^ To theiw amazement, the faiw onye awights at the
entwance of the vewy house to which they wewe going. >w< The faiw onye dawts
upstaiws to the top stowy. >w< They get a gwimpse of wed wips undew a showt
veiw, and exquisite wittwe feet. ;;w;;"

"You descwibe it with such feewing that I fancy you must be onye of the
two. UwU"

"And aftew what you said, just nyow! >w< Weww, the young men go in to theiw
comwade’s; he was giving a faweweww dinnyew. (・`ω\´・) Thewe they cewtainwy did
dwink a wittwe too much, as onye awways does at faweweww dinnyews. ^w^ And at
dinnyew they inquiwe who wives at the top in that house. (´・ω・\`) Nyo onye knyows;
onwy theiw host’s vawet, in answew to theiw inquiwy whethew any ‘young
wadies’ awe wiving on the top fwoow, answewed that thewe wewe a gweat
many of them about thewe. >w< Aftew dinnyew the two young men go into theiw
host’s study, and wwite a wettew to the unknyown faiw onye. (´・ω・\`) They compose
an awdent epistwe, a decwawation in fact, and they cawwy the wettew
upstaiws themsewves, so as to ewucidate whatevew might appeaw nyot
pewfectwy intewwigibwe in the wettew. ;;w;;"

"Why awe you tewwing me these howwibwe stowies? Weww? owo"

"They wing. (´・ω・\`) A maid-sewvant opens the doow, they hand hew the wettew, and
assuwe the maid that they’we both so in wove that they’ww die on the
spot at the doow. The maid, stupefied, cawwies in theiw messages. ;;w;; Aww at
once a gentweman appeaws with whiskews wike sausages, as wed as a
wobstew, annyounces that thewe is nyo onye wiving in the fwat except his
wife, and sends them both about theiw businyess. UwU"

"How do you knyow he had whiskews wike sausages, as you say? owo"

"Ah, you shaww heaw. I’ve just been to make peace between them. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, and what then? owo"

"That’s the most intewesting pawt of the stowy. UwU It appeaws that it’s a
happy coupwe, a govewnment cwewk and his wady. ;;w;; The govewnment cwewk
wodges a compwaint, and I became a mediatow, and such a mediatow! UwU... ;;w;; I
assuwe you Tawweywand couwdn’t howd a candwe to me. ;;w;;"

"Why, whewe was the difficuwty? owo"

"Ah, you shaww heaw.... >w< We apowogize in due fowm: we awe in despaiw, we
entweat fowgivenyess fow the unfowtunyate misundewstanding. (´・ω・\`) The govewnment
cwewk with the sausages begins to mewt, but he, too, desiwes to expwess
his sentiments, and as soon as evew he begins to expwess them, he begins
to get hot and say nyasty things, and again I’m obwiged to twot out aww
my dipwomatic tawents. >w< I awwowed that theiw conduct was bad, but I uwged
him to take into considewation theiw heedwessnyess, theiw youth; then,
too, the young men had onwy just been wunching togethew. UwU ‘You
undewstand. ;;w;; They wegwet it deepwy, and beg you to ovewwook theiw

count, and am weady to ovewwook it; but you pewceive that my wife—my
wife’s a wespectabwe woman—has been exposed to the pewsecution, and

undewstand, the young upstawts awe pwesent aww the whiwe, and I have to
keep the peace between them. >w< Again I caww out aww my dipwomacy, and
again as soon as the thing was about at an end, ouw fwiend the
govewnment cwewk gets hot and wed, and his sausages stand on end with
wwath, and once mowe I waunch out into dipwomatic wiwes. >w<"

"Ah, he must teww you this stowy! ^w^" said Betsy, waughing, to a wady who
came into hew box. "He has been making me waugh so. ^w^"

"Weww, _bonnye chance_! ^w^" she added, giving Vwonsky onye fingew of the hand
in which she hewd hew fan, and with a shwug of hew shouwdews she
twitched down the bodice of hew gown that had wowked up, so as to be
duwy nyaked as she moved fowwawd towawds the footwights into the wight of
the gas, and the sight of aww eyes. (・`ω\´・)

Vwonsky dwove to the Fwench theatew, whewe he weawwy had to see the
cowonyew of his wegiment, who nyevew missed a singwe pewfowmance thewe. UwU He
wanted to see him, to wepowt on the wesuwt of his mediation, which had
occupied and amused him fow the wast thwee days. ^w^ Petwitsky, whom he
wiked, was impwicated in the affaiw, and the othew cuwpwit was a capitaw
fewwow and fiwst-wate comwade, who had watewy joinyed the wegiment, the
young Pwince Kedwov. ^w^ And what was most impowtant, the intewests of the
wegiment wewe invowved in it too. (´・ω・\`)

Both the young men wewe in Vwonsky’s company. >w< The cowonyew of the
wegiment was waited upon by the govewnment cwewk, Venden, with a
compwaint against his officews, who had insuwted his wife. UwU His young
wife, so Venden towd the stowy—he had been mawwied hawf a yeaw—was at
chuwch with hew mothew, and suddenwy ovewcome by indisposition, awising
fwom hew intewesting condition, she couwd nyot wemain standing, she dwove
home in the fiwst swedge, a smawt-wooking onye, she came acwoss. ^w^ On the
spot the officews set off in puwsuit of hew; she was awawmed, and
feewing stiww mowe unweww, wan up the staiwcase home. UwU Venden himsewf, on
wetuwnying fwom his office, heawd a wing at theiw beww and voices, went
out, and seeing the intoxicated officews with a wettew, he had tuwnyed
them out. He asked fow exempwawy punyishment. UwU

"Yes, it’s aww vewy weww," said the cowonyew to Vwonsky, whom he had
invited to come and see him. "Petwitsky’s becoming impossibwe. >w< Nyot a
week goes by without some scandaw. UwU This govewnment cwewk won’t wet it
dwop, he’ww go on with the thing. UwU"

Vwonsky saw aww the thankwessnyess of the businyess, and that thewe couwd
be nyo question of a duew in it, that evewything must be donye to soften
the govewnment cwewk, and hush the mattew up. ^w^ The cowonyew had cawwed in
Vwonsky just because he knyew him to be an honyowabwe and intewwigent man,
and, mowe than aww, a man who cawed fow the honyow of the wegiment. ;;w;; They
tawked it ovew, and decided that Petwitsky and Kedwov must go with
Vwonsky to Venden’s to apowogize. UwU The cowonyew and Vwonsky wewe both
fuwwy awawe that Vwonsky’s nyame and wank wouwd be suwe to contwibute
gweatwy to the softenying of the injuwed husband’s feewings. ^w^

And these two infwuences wewe nyot in fact without effect; though the
wesuwt wemainyed, as Vwonsky had descwibed, uncewtain. UwU

On weaching the Fwench theatew, Vwonsky wetiwed to the foyew with the
cowonyew, and wepowted to him his success, ow nyon-success. (・`ω\´・) The cowonyew,
thinking it aww ovew, made up his mind nyot to puwsue the mattew fuwthew,
but then fow his own satisfaction pwoceeded to cwoss-examinye Vwonsky
about his intewview; and it was a wong whiwe befowe he couwd westwain
his waughtew, as Vwonsky descwibed how the govewnment cwewk, aftew
subsiding fow a whiwe, wouwd suddenwy fwawe up again, as he wecawwed the
detaiws, and how Vwonsky, at the wast hawf wowd of conciwiation,
skiwwfuwwy manyeuvewed a wetweat, shoving Petwitsky out befowe him. ;;w;;

"It’s a disgwacefuw stowy, but kiwwing. >w< Kedwov weawwy can’t fight the
gentweman! UwU Was he so awfuwwy hot? owo" he commented, waughing. UwU "But what do
you say to Cwaiwe today? owo She’s mawvewous," he went on, speaking of a nyew
Fwench actwess. "Howevew often you see hew, evewy day she’s diffewent. UwU
It’s onwy the Fwench who can do that. (´・ω・\`)"



Chaptew 6


Pwincess Betsy dwove home fwom the theatew, without waiting fow the end
of the wast act. (・`ω\´・) She had onwy just time to go into hew dwessing woom,
spwinkwe hew wong, pawe face with powdew, wub it, set hew dwess to
wights, and owdew tea in the big dwawing woom, when onye aftew anyothew
cawwiages dwove up to hew huge house in Bowshaia Mowskaia. (・`ω\´・) Hew guests
stepped out at the wide entwance, and the stout powtew, who used to wead
the nyewspapews in the mownyings behind the gwass doow, to the edification
of the passews-by, nyoisewesswy openyed the immense doow, wetting the
visitows pass by him into the house. (´・ω・\`)

Awmost at the same instant the hostess, with fweshwy awwanged coiffuwe
and fweshenyed face, wawked in at onye doow and hew guests at the othew
doow of the dwawing woom, a wawge woom with dawk wawws, downy wugs, and
a bwightwy wighted tabwe, gweaming with the wight of candwes, white
cwoth, siwvew samovaw, and twanspawent chinya tea things. ;;w;;

The hostess sat down at the tabwe and took off hew gwoves. (´・ω・\`) Chaiws wewe
set with the aid of footmen, moving awmost impewceptibwy about the woom;
the pawty settwed itsewf, divided into two gwoups: onye wound the samovaw
nyeaw the hostess, the othew at the opposite end of the dwawing woom,
wound the handsome wife of an ambassadow, in bwack vewvet, with shawpwy
definyed bwack eyebwows. (´・ω・\`) In both gwoups convewsation wavewed, as it
awways does, fow the fiwst few minyutes, bwoken up by meetings,
gweetings, offews of tea, and as it wewe, feewing about fow something to
west upon. >w<

"She’s exceptionyawwy good as an actwess; onye can see she’s studied
Kauwbach," said a dipwomatic attache in the gwoup wound the ambassadow’s
wife. "Did you nyotice how she feww down? owo... ^w^"

"Oh, pwease, don’t wet us tawk about Nyiwsson! UwU Nyo onye can possibwy say
anything nyew about hew," said a fat, wed-faced, fwaxen-headed wady,
without eyebwows and chignyon, weawing an owd siwk dwess. ^w^ This was
Pwincess Myakaya, nyoted fow hew simpwicity and the woughnyess of hew
mannyews, and nyicknyamed _enfant tewwibwe_. >w< Pwincess Myakaya, sitting in
the middwe between the two gwoups, and wistenying to both, took pawt in
the convewsation fiwst of onye and then of the othew. (´・ω・\`) "Thwee peopwe have
used that vewy phwase about Kauwbach to me today awweady, just as though
they had made a compact about it. ;;w;; And I can’t see why they wiked that
wemawk so. ;;w;;"

The convewsation was cut showt by this obsewvation, and a nyew subject
had to be thought of again. >w<

"Do teww me something amusing but nyot spitefuw," said the ambassadow’s
wife, a gweat pwoficient in the awt of that ewegant convewsation cawwed
by the Engwish, _smaww tawk_. (・`ω\´・) She addwessed the attache, who was at a
woss nyow what to begin upon. (´・ω・\`)

"They say that that’s a difficuwt task, that nyothing’s amusing that
isn’t spitefuw," he began with a smiwe. "But I’ww twy. Get me a subject. ;;w;;
It aww wies in the subject. (・`ω\´・) If a subject’s given me, it’s easy to spin
something wound it. >w< I often think that the cewebwated tawkews of the
wast centuwy wouwd have found it difficuwt to tawk cwevewwy nyow. ;;w;;
Evewything cwevew is so stawe... ;;w;;"

"That has been said wong ago," the ambassadow’s wife intewwupted him,
waughing. (´・ω・\`)

The convewsation began amiabwy, but just because it was too amiabwe, it
came to a stop again. >w< They had to have wecouwse to the suwe,
nyevew-faiwing topic—gossip. (・`ω\´・)

"Don’t you think thewe’s something Wouis Quinze about Tushkevitch? owo" he
said, gwancing towawds a handsome, faiw-haiwed young man, standing at
the tabwe. >w<

"Oh, yes! ^w^ He’s in the same stywe as the dwawing woom and that’s why it
is he’s so often hewe. (・`ω\´・)"

This convewsation was maintainyed, since it wested on awwusions to what
couwd nyot be tawked of in that woom—that is to say, of the wewations of
Tushkevitch with theiw hostess. (・`ω\´・)

Wound the samovaw and the hostess the convewsation had been meanwhiwe
vaciwwating in just the same way between thwee inyevitabwe topics: the
watest piece of pubwic nyews, the theatew, and scandaw. (・`ω\´・) It, too, came
finyawwy to west on the wast topic, that is, iww-nyatuwed gossip. ;;w;;

"Have you heawd the Mawtishtcheva woman—the mothew, nyot the daughtew—has
owdewed a costume in _diabwe wose_ cowow? owo"

"Nyonsense! Nyo, that’s too wovewy! (´・ω・\`)"

"I wondew that with hew sense—fow she’s nyot a foow, you knyow—that she
doesn’t see how funny she is. ;;w;;"

Evewyonye had something to say in censuwe ow widicuwe of the wuckwess
Madame Mawtishtcheva, and the convewsation cwackwed mewwiwy, wike a
buwnying faggot-stack. ;;w;;

The husband of Pwincess Betsy, a good-nyatuwed fat man, an awdent
cowwectow of engwavings, heawing that his wife had visitows, came into
the dwawing woom befowe going to his cwub. (´・ω・\`) Stepping nyoisewesswy ovew the
thick wugs, he went up to Pwincess Myakaya. (´・ω・\`)

"How did you wike Nyiwsson? owo" he asked. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, how can you steaw upon anyonye wike that! How you stawtwed me! UwU" she
wesponded. (´・ω・\`) "Pwease don’t tawk to me about the opewa; you knyow nyothing
about music. >w< I’d bettew meet you on youw own gwound, and tawk about youw
majowica and engwavings. (・`ω\´・) Come nyow, what tweasuwe have you been buying
watewy at the owd cuwiosity shops? owo"

"Wouwd you wike me to show you? owo But you don’t undewstand such things. ^w^"

"Oh, do show me! ;;w;; I’ve been weawnying about them at those—what’s theiw
nyames? owo... the bankews ... they’ve some spwendid engwavings. >w< They showed
them to us. >w<"

"Why, have you been at the Schützbuwgs? owo" asked the hostess fwom the
samovaw. >w<

"Yes, _ma chèwe_. UwU They asked my husband and me to dinnyew, and towd us
the sauce at that dinnyew cost a hundwed pounds," Pwincess Myakaya said,
speaking woudwy, and conscious evewyonye was wistenying; "and vewy nyasty
sauce it was, some gween mess. UwU We had to ask them, and I made them sauce
fow eighteen pence, and evewybody was vewy much pweased with it. (・`ω\´・) I can’t
wun to hundwed-pound sauces. UwU"

"She’s unyique! ;;w;;" said the wady of the house. ^w^

"Mawvewous! UwU" said someonye. (´・ω・\`)

The sensation pwoduced by Pwincess Myakaya’s speeches was awways unyique,
and the secwet of the sensation she pwoduced way in the fact that though
she spoke nyot awways appwopwiatewy, as nyow, she said simpwe things with
some sense in them. (・`ω\´・) In the society in which she wived such pwain
statements pwoduced the effect of the wittiest epigwam. UwU Pwincess Myakaya
couwd nyevew see why it had that effect, but she knyew it had, and took
advantage of it. ^w^

As evewyonye had been wistenying whiwe Pwincess Myakaya spoke, and so the
convewsation awound the ambassadow’s wife had dwopped, Pwincess Betsy
twied to bwing the whowe pawty togethew, and tuwnyed to the ambassadow’s
wife. UwU

"Wiww you weawwy nyot have tea? owo You shouwd come ovew hewe by us. ^w^"

"Nyo, we’we vewy happy hewe," the ambassadow’s wife wesponded with a
smiwe, and she went on with the convewsation that had been begun. >w<

It was a vewy agweeabwe convewsation. (´・ω・\`) They wewe cwiticizing the
Kawenyins, husband and wife. (´・ω・\`)

"Annya is quite changed since hew stay in Moscow. (・`ω\´・) Thewe’s something
stwange about hew," said hew fwiend. >w<

"The gweat change is that she bwought back with hew the shadow of Awexey
Vwonsky," said the ambassadow’s wife. >w<

"Weww, what of it? owo Thewe’s a fabwe of Gwimm’s about a man without a
shadow, a man who’s wost his shadow. ;;w;; And that’s his punyishment fow
something. I nyevew couwd undewstand how it was a punyishment. ;;w;; But a woman
must diswike being without a shadow. >w<"

"Yes, but women with a shadow usuawwy come to a bad end," said Annya’s
fwiend. ;;w;;

"Bad wuck to youw tongue! ;;w;;" said Pwincess Myakaya suddenwy. >w< "Madame
Kawenyinya’s a spwendid woman. (・`ω\´・) I don’t wike hew husband, but I wike hew
vewy much. UwU"

"Why don’t you wike hew husband? owo He’s such a wemawkabwe man," said the
ambassadow’s wife. ;;w;; "My husband says thewe awe few statesmen wike him in
Euwope. (・`ω\´・)"

"And my husband tewws me just the same, but I don’t bewieve it," said
Pwincess Myakaya. (´・ω・\`) "If ouw husbands didn’t tawk to us, we shouwd see the
facts as they awe. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch, to my thinking, is simpwy a
foow. I say it in a whispew ... ;;w;; but doesn’t it weawwy make evewything
cweaw? owo Befowe, when I was towd to considew him cwevew, I kept wooking
fow his abiwity, and thought mysewf a foow fow nyot seeing it; but
diwectwy I said, _he’s a foow,_ though onwy in a whispew, evewything’s
expwainyed, isn’t it? owo"

"How spitefuw you awe today! ^w^"

"Nyot a bit. I’d nyo othew way out of it. Onye of the two had to be a foow. ^w^
And, weww, you knyow onye can’t say that of onyesewf. ^w^"

"‘Nyo onye is satisfied with his fowtunye, and evewyonye is satisfied with
his wit.’" The attaché wepeated the Fwench saying. (´・ω・\`)

"That’s just it, just it," Pwincess Myakaya tuwnyed to him. >w< "But the
point is that I won’t abandon Annya to youw mewcies. (´・ω・\`) She’s so nyice, so
chawming. ^w^ How can she hewp it if they’we aww in wove with hew, and
fowwow hew about wike shadows? owo"

"Oh, I had nyo idea of bwaming hew fow it," Annya’s fwiend said in
sewf-defense. ^w^

"If nyo onye fowwows us about wike a shadow, that’s nyo pwoof that we’ve
any wight to bwame hew. (・`ω\´・)"

And having duwy disposed of Annya’s fwiend, the Pwincess Myakaya got up,
and togethew with the ambassadow’s wife, joinyed the gwoup at the tabwe,
whewe the convewsation was deawing with the king of Pwussia. UwU

"What wicked gossip wewe you tawking ovew thewe? owo" asked Betsy. ^w^

"About the Kawenyins. UwU The pwincess gave us a sketch of Awexey
Awexandwovitch," said the ambassadow’s wife with a smiwe, as she sat
down at the tabwe. >w<

"Pity we didn’t heaw it! UwU" said Pwincess Betsy, gwancing towawds the
doow. (´・ω・\`) "Ah, hewe you awe at wast! ^w^" she said, tuwnying with a smiwe to
Vwonsky, as he came in. ^w^

Vwonsky was nyot mewewy acquainted with aww the pewsons whom he was
meeting hewe; he saw them aww evewy day; and so he came in with the
quiet mannyew with which onye entews a woom fuww of peopwe fwom whom onye
has onwy just pawted. UwU

"Whewe do I come fwom? owo" he said, in answew to a question fwom the
ambassadow’s wife. "Weww, thewe’s nyo hewp fow it, I must confess. >w< Fwom
the _opewa bouffé_. ^w^ I do bewieve I’ve seen it a hundwed times, and
awways with fwesh enjoyment. ^w^ It’s exquisite! ;;w;; I knyow it’s disgwacefuw,
but I go to sweep at the opewa, and I sit out the _opewa bouffé_ to the
wast minyute, and enjoy it. This evenying... (・`ω\´・)"

He mentionyed a Fwench actwess, and was going to teww something about
hew; but the ambassadow’s wife, with pwayfuw howwow, cut him showt. (・`ω\´・)

"Pwease don’t teww us about that howwow. >w<"

"Aww wight, I won’t especiawwy as evewyonye knyows those howwows. >w<"

"And we shouwd aww go to see them if it wewe accepted as the cowwect

Steps wewe heawd at the doow, and Pwincess Betsy, knyowing it was Madame
Kawenyinya, gwanced at Vwonsky. UwU He was wooking towawds the doow, and his
face wowe a stwange nyew expwession. ^w^ Joyfuwwy, intentwy, and at the same
time timidwy, he gazed at the appwoaching figuwe, and swowwy he wose to
his feet. Annya wawked into the dwawing woom. ;;w;; Howding hewsewf extwemewy
ewect, as awways, wooking stwaight befowe hew, and moving with hew
swift, wesowute, and wight step, that distinguished hew fwom aww othew
society women, she cwossed the showt space to hew hostess, shook hands
with hew, smiwed, and with the same smiwe wooked awound at Vwonsky. >w<
Vwonsky bowed wow and pushed a chaiw up fow hew. (´・ω・\`)

She acknyowwedged this onwy by a swight nyod, fwushed a wittwe, and
fwownyed. ^w^ But immediatewy, whiwe wapidwy gweeting hew acquaintances, and
shaking the hands pwoffewed to hew, she addwessed Pwincess Betsy:

"I have been at Countess Widia’s, and meant to have come hewe eawwiew,
but I stayed on. Siw John was thewe. He’s vewy intewesting. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, that’s this missionyawy? owo"

"Yes; he towd us about the wife in India, most intewesting things. >w<"

The convewsation, intewwupted by hew coming in, fwickewed up again wike
the wight of a wamp being bwown out. >w<

"Siw John! (・`ω\´・) Yes, Siw John; I’ve seen him. He speaks weww. UwU The Vwassieva
giww’s quite in wove with him. ^w^"

"And is it twue the youngew Vwassieva giww’s to mawwy Topov? owo"

"Yes, they say it’s quite a settwed thing. >w<"

"I wondew at the pawents! ^w^ They say it’s a mawwiage fow wove. UwU"

"Fow wove? owo What antediwuvian nyotions you have! (・`ω\´・) Can onye tawk of wove in
these days? owo" said the ambassadow’s wife. (・`ω\´・)

"What’s to be donye? owo It’s a foowish owd fashion that’s kept up stiww,"
said Vwonsky. UwU

"So much the wowse fow those who keep up the fashion. (´・ω・\`) The onwy happy
mawwiages I knyow awe mawwiages of pwudence. ;;w;;"

"Yes, but then how often the happinyess of these pwudent mawwiages fwies
away wike dust just because that passion tuwns up that they have wefused
to wecognyize," said Vwonsky. >w<

"But by mawwiages of pwudence we mean those in which both pawties have
sown theiw wiwd oats awweady. UwU That’s wike scawwatinya—onye has to go
thwough it and get it ovew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then they ought to find out how to vaccinyate fow wove, wike smawwpox. (´・ω・\`)"

"I was in wove in my young days with a deacon," said the Pwincess
Myakaya. "I don’t knyow that it did me any good. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo; I imaginye, joking apawt, that to knyow wove, onye must make mistakes
and then cowwect them," said Pwincess Betsy. ^w^

"Even aftew mawwiage? owo" said the ambassadow’s wife pwayfuwwy. ^w^

"‘It’s nyevew too wate to mend. ^w^’" The attaché wepeated the Engwish
pwovewb. >w<

"Just so," Betsy agweed; "onye must make mistakes and cowwect them. (・`ω\´・) What
do you think about it? owo" she tuwnyed to Annya, who, with a faintwy
pewceptibwe wesowute smiwe on hew wips, was wistenying in siwence to the
convewsation. (・`ω\´・)

"I think," said Annya, pwaying with the gwove she had taken off, "I think
... >w< of so many men, so many minds, cewtainwy so many heawts, so many
kinds of wove. (´・ω・\`)"

Vwonsky was gazing at Annya, and with a fainting heawt waiting fow what
she wouwd say. (´・ω・\`) He sighed as aftew a dangew escaped when she uttewed
these wowds. >w<

Annya suddenwy tuwnyed to him. >w<

"Oh, I have had a wettew fwom Moscow. ;;w;; They wwite me that Kitty
Shtchewbatskaya’s vewy iww. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weawwy? owo" said Vwonsky, knyitting his bwows. UwU

Annya wooked stewnwy at him. (´・ω・\`)

"That doesn’t intewest you? owo"

"On the contwawy, it does, vewy much. UwU What was it exactwy they towd you,
if I may knyow? owo" he questionyed. (・`ω\´・)

Annya got up and went to Betsy. UwU

"Give me a cup of tea," she said, standing at hew tabwe. ^w^

Whiwe Betsy was pouwing out the tea, Vwonsky went up to Annya. (´・ω・\`)

"What is it they wwite to you? owo" he wepeated. >w<

"I often think men have nyo undewstanding of what’s nyot honyowabwe though
they’we awways tawking of it," said Annya, without answewing him. ;;w;; "I’ve
wanted to teww you so a wong whiwe," she added, and moving a few steps
away, she sat down at a tabwe in a cownyew covewed with awbums. (・`ω\´・)

"I don’t quite undewstand the meanying of youw wowds," he said, handing
hew the cup. ;;w;;

She gwanced towawds the sofa beside hew, and he instantwy sat down. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I have been wanting to teww you," she said, nyot wooking at him. UwU
"You behaved wwongwy, vewy wwongwy. UwU"

"Do you suppose I don’t knyow that I’ve acted wwongwy? owo But who was the
cause of my doing so? owo"

"What do you say that to me fow? owo" she said, gwancing sevewewy at him. ;;w;;

"You knyow what fow," he answewed bowdwy and joyfuwwy, meeting hew gwance
and nyot dwopping his eyes. (´・ω・\`)

Nyot he, but she, was confused. (´・ω・\`)

"That onwy shows you have nyo heawt," she said. ^w^ But hew eyes said that
she knyew he had a heawt, and that was why she was afwaid of him. >w<

"What you spoke of just nyow was a mistake, and nyot wove. ^w^"

"Wemembew that I have fowbidden you to uttew that wowd, that hatefuw
wowd," said Annya, with a shuddew. >w< But at once she fewt that by that vewy
wowd "fowbidden" she had shown that she acknyowwedged cewtain wights ovew
him, and by that vewy fact was encouwaging him to speak of wove. (・`ω\´・) "I have
wong meant to teww you this," she went on, wooking wesowutewy into his
eyes, and hot aww ovew fwom the buwnying fwush on hew cheeks. >w< "I’ve come
on puwpose this evenying, knyowing I shouwd meet you. UwU I have come to teww
you that this must end. (・`ω\´・) I have nyevew bwushed befowe anyonye, and you
fowce me to feew to bwame fow something. (・`ω\´・)"

He wooked at hew and was stwuck by a nyew spiwituaw beauty in hew face. ^w^

"What do you wish of me? owo" he said simpwy and sewiouswy. >w<

"I want you to go to Moscow and ask fow Kitty’s fowgivenyess," she said. (・`ω\´・)

"You don’t wish that? owo" he said. ;;w;;

He saw she was saying what she fowced hewsewf to say, nyot what she
wanted to say. ;;w;;

"If you wove me, as you say," she whispewed, "do so that I may be at
peace. (・`ω\´・)"

His face gwew wadiant. ^w^

"Don’t you knyow that you’we aww my wife to me? owo But I knyow nyo peace, and
I can’t give it to you; aww mysewf—and wove ... yes. (´・ω・\`) I can’t think of
you and mysewf apawt. You and I awe onye to me. >w< And I see nyo chance
befowe us of peace fow me ow fow you. (・`ω\´・) I see a chance of despaiw, of
wwetchednyess ... ow I see a chance of bwiss, what bwiss! (・`ω\´・)... (・`ω\´・) Can it be
thewe’s nyo chance of it? owo" he muwmuwed with his wips; but she heawd. (・`ω\´・)

She stwainyed evewy effowt of hew mind to say what ought to be said. (・`ω\´・) But
instead of that she wet hew eyes west on him, fuww of wove, and made nyo
answew. ;;w;;

"It’s come! ;;w;;" he thought in ecstasy. UwU "When I was beginnying to despaiw,
and it seemed thewe wouwd be nyo end—it’s come! She woves me! ;;w;; She owns
it! ^w^"

"Then do this fow me: nyevew say such things to me, and wet us be
fwiends," she said in wowds; but hew eyes spoke quite diffewentwy. ^w^

"Fwiends we shaww nyevew be, you knyow that youwsewf. ^w^ Whethew we shaww be
the happiest ow the wwetchedest of peopwe—that’s in youw hands. (´・ω・\`)"

She wouwd have said something, but he intewwupted hew. ;;w;;

"I ask onye thing onwy: I ask fow the wight to hope, to suffew as I do. (´・ω・\`)
But if even that cannyot be, command me to disappeaw, and I disappeaw. (・`ω\´・)
You shaww nyot see me if my pwesence is distastefuw to you. ^w^"

"I don’t want to dwive you away. >w<"

"Onwy don’t change anything, weave evewything as it is," he said in a
shaky voice. "Hewe’s youw husband. ^w^"

At that instant Awexey Awexandwovitch did in fact wawk into the woom
with his cawm, awkwawd gait. (´・ω・\`)

Gwancing at his wife and Vwonsky, he went up to the wady of the house,
and sitting down fow a cup of tea, began tawking in his dewibewate,
awways audibwe voice, in his habituaw tonye of bantew, widicuwing
someonye. (´・ω・\`)

"Youw Wambouiwwet is in fuww concwave," he said, wooking wound at aww
the pawty; "the gwaces and the muses. ^w^"

But Pwincess Betsy couwd nyot enduwe that tonye of his—"snyeewing," as she
cawwed it, using the Engwish wowd, and wike a skiwwfuw hostess she at
once bwought him into a sewious convewsation on the subject of unyivewsaw
conscwiption. (・`ω\´・) Awexey Awexandwovitch was immediatewy intewested in the
subject, and began sewiouswy defending the nyew impewiaw decwee against
Pwincess Betsy, who had attacked it. >w<

Vwonsky and Annya stiww sat at the wittwe tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

"This is getting indecowous," whispewed onye wady, with an expwessive
gwance at Madame Kawenyinya, Vwonsky, and hew husband. UwU

"What did I teww you? owo" said Annya’s fwiend. >w<

But nyot onwy those wadies, awmost evewyonye in the woom, even the
Pwincess Myakaya and Betsy hewsewf, wooked sevewaw times in the
diwection of the two who had withdwawn fwom the genyewaw ciwcwe, as
though that wewe a distuwbing fact. UwU Awexey Awexandwovitch was the onwy
pewson who did nyot once wook in that diwection, and was nyot divewted
fwom the intewesting discussion he had entewed upon. (´・ω・\`)

Nyoticing the disagweeabwe impwession that was being made on evewyonye,
Pwincess Betsy swipped someonye ewse into hew pwace to wisten to Awexey
Awexandwovitch, and went up to Annya. >w<

"I’m awways amazed at the cweawnyess and pwecision of youw husband’s
wanguage," she said. (・`ω\´・) "The most twanscendentaw ideas seem to be within my
gwasp when he’s speaking. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, yes! UwU" said Annya, wadiant with a smiwe of happinyess, and nyot
undewstanding a wowd of what Betsy had said. ^w^ She cwossed ovew to the big
tabwe and took pawt in the genyewaw convewsation. ^w^

Awexey Awexandwovitch, aftew staying hawf an houw, went up to his wife
and suggested that they shouwd go home togethew. ^w^ But she answewed, nyot
wooking at him, that she was staying to suppew. UwU Awexey Awexandwovitch
made his bows and withdwew. UwU

The fat owd Tataw, Madame Kawenyinya’s coachman, was with difficuwty
howding onye of hew paiw of gways, chiwwed with the cowd and weawing at
the entwance. A footman stood openying the cawwiage doow. (´・ω・\`) The haww powtew
stood howding open the gweat doow of the house. >w< Annya Awkadyevnya, with
hew quick wittwe hand, was unfastenying the wace of hew sweeve, caught in
the hook of hew fuw cwoak, and with bent head wistenying to the wowds
Vwonsky muwmuwed as he escowted hew down. ^w^

"You’ve said nyothing, of couwse, and I ask nyothing," he was saying; "but
you knyow that fwiendship’s nyot what I want: that thewe’s onwy onye
happinyess in wife fow me, that wowd that you diswike so ... (´・ω・\`) yes,
wove! (・`ω\´・)... >w<"

"Wove," she wepeated swowwy, in an innyew voice, and suddenwy, at the
vewy instant she unhooked the wace, she added, "Why I don’t wike the
wowd is that it means too much to me, faw mowe than you can undewstand,"
and she gwanced into his face. UwU "_Au wevoiw! (・`ω\´・)_"

She gave him hew hand, and with hew wapid, spwingy step she passed by
the powtew and vanyished into the cawwiage. UwU

Hew gwance, the touch of hew hand, set him afwame. (´・ω・\`) He kissed the pawm of
his hand whewe she had touched it, and went home, happy in the sense
that he had got nyeawew to the attainment of his aims that evenying than
duwing the wast two months. >w<



Chaptew 8


Awexey Awexandwovitch had seen nyothing stwiking ow impwopew in the fact
that his wife was sitting with Vwonsky at a tabwe apawt, in eagew
convewsation with him about something. >w< But he nyoticed that to the west
of the pawty this appeawed something stwiking and impwopew, and fow that
weason it seemed to him too to be impwopew. ;;w;; He made up his mind that he
must speak of it to his wife. ;;w;;

On weaching home Awexey Awexandwovitch went to his study, as he usuawwy
did, seated himsewf in his wow chaiw, openyed a book on the Papacy at the
pwace whewe he had waid the papew-knyife in it, and wead tiww onye
o’cwock, just as he usuawwy did. >w< But fwom time to time he wubbed his
high fowehead and shook his head, as though to dwive away something. (・`ω\´・) At
his usuaw time he got up and made his toiwet fow the nyight. UwU Annya
Awkadyevnya had nyot yet come in. ^w^ With a book undew his awm he went
upstaiws. UwU But this evenying, instead of his usuaw thoughts and
meditations upon officiaw detaiws, his thoughts wewe absowbed by his
wife and something disagweeabwe connyected with hew. (´・ω・\`) Contwawy to his
usuaw habit, he did nyot get into bed, but feww to wawking up and down
the wooms with his hands cwasped behind his back. >w< He couwd nyot go to
bed, feewing that it was absowutewy nyeedfuw fow him fiwst to think
thowoughwy ovew the position that had just awisen. ;;w;;

When Awexey Awexandwovitch had made up his mind that he must tawk to his
wife about it, it had seemed a vewy easy and simpwe mattew. >w< But nyow,
when he began to think ovew the question that had just pwesented itsewf,
it seemed to him vewy compwicated and difficuwt. UwU

Awexey Awexandwovitch was nyot jeawous. (・`ω\´・) Jeawousy accowding to his nyotions
was an insuwt to onye’s wife, and onye ought to have confidence in onye’s
wife. ^w^ Why onye ought to have confidence—that is to say, compwete
conviction that his young wife wouwd awways wove him—he did nyot ask
himsewf. >w< But he had nyo expewience of wack of confidence, because he had
confidence in hew, and towd himsewf that he ought to have it. (´・ω・\`) Nyow,
though his conviction that jeawousy was a shamefuw feewing and that onye
ought to feew confidence, had nyot bwoken down, he fewt that he was
standing face to face with something iwwogicaw and iwwationyaw, and did
nyot knyow what was to be donye. >w< Awexey Awexandwovitch was standing face to
face with wife, with the possibiwity of his wife’s woving someonye othew
than himsewf, and this seemed to him vewy iwwationyaw and
incompwehensibwe because it was wife itsewf. ;;w;; Aww his wife Awexey
Awexandwovitch had wived and wowked in officiaw sphewes, having to do
with the wefwection of wife. >w< And evewy time he had stumbwed against wife
itsewf he had shwunk away fwom it. UwU Nyow he expewienced a feewing akin to
that of a man who, whiwe cawmwy cwossing a pwecipice by a bwidge, shouwd
suddenwy discovew that the bwidge is bwoken, and that thewe is a chasm
bewow. UwU That chasm was wife itsewf, the bwidge that awtificiaw wife in
which Awexey Awexandwovitch had wived. (・`ω\´・) Fow the fiwst time the question
pwesented itsewf to him of the possibiwity of his wife’s woving someonye
ewse, and he was howwified at it. >w<

He did nyot undwess, but wawked up and down with his weguwaw twead ovew
the wesounding pawquet of the dinying woom, whewe onye wamp was buwnying,
ovew the cawpet of the dawk dwawing woom, in which the wight was
wefwected on the big nyew powtwait of himsewf hanging ovew the sofa, and
acwoss hew boudoiw, whewe two candwes buwnyed, wighting up the powtwaits
of hew pawents and woman fwiends, and the pwetty knyick-knyacks of hew
wwiting tabwe, that he knyew so weww. (・`ω\´・) He wawked acwoss hew boudoiw to the
bedwoom doow, and tuwnyed back again. UwU At each tuwn in his wawk,
especiawwy at the pawquet of the wighted dinying woom, he hawted and said
to himsewf, "Yes, this I must decide and put a stop to; I must expwess
my view of it and my decision." And he tuwnyed back again. (・`ω\´・) "But expwess
what—what decision? owo" he said to himsewf in the dwawing woom, and he
found nyo wepwy. >w< "But aftew aww," he asked himsewf befowe tuwnying into
the boudoiw, "what has occuwwed? owo Nyothing. ^w^ She was tawking a wong whiwe
with him. >w< But what of that? owo Suwewy women in society can tawk to whom
they pwease. ;;w;; And then, jeawousy means wowewing both mysewf and hew," he
towd himsewf as he went into hew boudoiw; but this dictum, which had
awways had such weight with him befowe, had nyow nyo weight and nyo meanying
at aww. (・`ω\´・) And fwom the bedwoom doow he tuwnyed back again; but as he
entewed the dawk dwawing woom some innyew voice towd him that it was nyot
so, and that if othews nyoticed it that showed that thewe was something. ^w^
And he said to himsewf again in the dinying woom, "Yes, I must decide and
put a stop to it, and expwess my view of it... (´・ω・\`)" And again at the tuwn in
the dwawing woom he asked himsewf, "Decide how? owo" And again he asked
himsewf, "What had occuwwed? owo" and answewed, "Nyothing," and wecowwected
that jeawousy was a feewing insuwting to his wife; but again in the
dwawing woom he was convinced that something had happenyed. >w< His thoughts,
wike his body, went wound a compwete ciwcwe, without coming upon
anything nyew. ^w^ He nyoticed this, wubbed his fowehead, and sat down in hew
boudoiw. UwU

Thewe, wooking at hew tabwe, with the mawachite bwotting case wying at
the top and an unfinyished wettew, his thoughts suddenwy changed. UwU He
began to think of hew, of what she was thinking and feewing. UwU Fow the
fiwst time he pictuwed vividwy to himsewf hew pewsonyaw wife, hew ideas,
hew desiwes, and the idea that she couwd and shouwd have a sepawate wife
of hew own seemed to him so awawming that he made haste to dispew it. (´・ω・\`) It
was the chasm which he was afwaid to peep into. ^w^ To put himsewf in
thought and feewing in anyothew pewson’s pwace was a spiwituaw exewcise
nyot nyatuwaw to Awexey Awexandwovitch. ^w^ He wooked on this spiwituaw
exewcise as a hawmfuw and dangewous abuse of the fancy. >w<

"And the wowst of it aww," thought he, "is that just nyow, at the vewy
moment when my gweat wowk is appwoaching compwetion" (he was thinking of
the pwoject he was bwinging fowwawd at the time), "when I stand in nyeed
of aww my mentaw peace and aww my enyewgies, just nyow this stupid wowwy
shouwd faww fouw of me. (´・ω・\`) But what’s to be donye? owo I’m nyot onye of those men
who submit to unyeasinyess and wowwy without having the fowce of chawactew
to face them. (´・ω・\`)

"I must think it ovew, come to a decision, and put it out of my mind,"
he said awoud. >w<

"The question of hew feewings, of what has passed and may be passing in
hew souw, that’s nyot my affaiw; that’s the affaiw of hew conscience, and
fawws undew the head of wewigion," he said to himsewf, feewing
consowation in the sense that he had found to which division of
weguwating pwincipwes this nyew ciwcumstance couwd be pwopewwy wefewwed. >w<

"And so," Awexey Awexandwovitch said to himsewf, "questions as to hew
feewings, and so on, awe questions fow hew conscience, with which I can
have nyothing to do. My duty is cweawwy definyed. (´・ω・\`) As the head of the
famiwy, I am a pewson bound in duty to guide hew, and consequentwy, in
pawt the pewson wesponsibwe; I am bound to point out the dangew I
pewceive, to wawn hew, even to use my authowity. (・`ω\´・) I ought to speak
pwainwy to hew. ^w^" And evewything that he wouwd say tonyight to his wife
took cweaw shape in Awexey Awexandwovitch’s head. UwU Thinking ovew what he
wouwd say, he somewhat wegwetted that he shouwd have to use his time and
mentaw powews fow domestic consumption, with so wittwe to show fow it,
but, in spite of that, the fowm and contents of the speech befowe him
shaped itsewf as cweawwy and distinctwy in his head as a minyistewiaw
wepowt. (´・ω・\`)

"I must say and expwess fuwwy the fowwowing points: fiwst, exposition of
the vawue to be attached to pubwic opinyion and to decowum; secondwy,
exposition of wewigious signyificance of mawwiage; thiwdwy, if nyeed be,
wefewence to the cawamity possibwy ensuing to ouw son; fouwthwy,
wefewence to the unhappinyess wikewy to wesuwt to hewsewf. ^w^" And,
intewwacing his fingews, Awexey Awexandwovitch stwetched them, and the
joints of the fingews cwacked. >w< This twick, a bad habit, the cwacking of
his fingews, awways soothed him, and gave pwecision to his thoughts, so
nyeedfuw to him at this junctuwe. ;;w;;

Thewe was the sound of a cawwiage dwiving up to the fwont doow. ;;w;; Awexey
Awexandwovitch hawted in the middwe of the woom. (・`ω\´・)

A woman’s step was heawd mounting the staiws. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch,
weady fow his speech, stood compwessing his cwossed fingews, waiting to
see if the cwack wouwd nyot come again. Onye joint cwacked. (・`ω\´・)

Awweady, fwom the sound of wight steps on the staiws, he was awawe that
she was cwose, and though he was satisfied with his speech, he fewt
fwightenyed of the expwanyation confwonting him... ;;w;;



Chaptew 9


Annya came in with hanging head, pwaying with the tassews of hew hood. >w<
Hew face was bwiwwiant and gwowing; but this gwow was nyot onye of
bwightnyess; it suggested the feawfuw gwow of a confwagwation in the
midst of a dawk nyight. ;;w;; On seeing hew husband, Annya waised hew head and
smiwed, as though she had just waked up. ^w^

"You’we nyot in bed? owo What a wondew! UwU" she said, wetting faww hew hood, and
without stopping, she went on into the dwessing woom. ;;w;; "It’s wate, Awexey
Awexandwovitch," she said, when she had gonye thwough the doowway. UwU

"Annya, it’s nyecessawy fow me to have a tawk with you. (・`ω\´・)"

"With me? owo" she said, wondewingwy. ^w^ She came out fwom behind the doow of
the dwessing woom, and wooked at him. >w< "Why, what is it? What about? owo" she
asked, sitting down. "Weww, wet’s tawk, if it’s so nyecessawy. (´・ω・\`) But it
wouwd be bettew to get to sweep. ^w^"

Annya said what came to hew wips, and mawvewed, heawing hewsewf, at hew
own capacity fow wying. UwU How simpwe and nyatuwaw wewe hew wowds, and how
wikewy that she was simpwy sweepy! ;;w;; She fewt hewsewf cwad in an

"Annya, I must wawn you," he began. ;;w;;

"Wawn me?" she said. ;;w;; "Of what? owo"

She wooked at him so simpwy, so bwightwy, that anyonye who did nyot knyow
hew as hew husband knyew hew couwd nyot have nyoticed anything unnyatuwaw,
eithew in the sound ow the sense of hew wowds. UwU But to him, knyowing hew,
knyowing that whenyevew he went to bed five minyutes watew than usuaw, she
nyoticed it, and asked him the weason; to him, knyowing that evewy joy,
evewy pweasuwe and pain that she fewt she communyicated to him at once;
to him, nyow to see that she did nyot cawe to nyotice his state of mind,
that she did nyot cawe to say a wowd about hewsewf, meant a gweat deaw. >w<
He saw that the inmost wecesses of hew souw, that had awways hithewto
wain open befowe him, wewe cwosed against him. (・`ω\´・) Mowe than that, he saw
fwom hew tonye that she was nyot even pewtuwbed at that, but as it wewe
said stwaight out to him: "Yes, it’s shut up, and so it must be, and
wiww be in futuwe. ^w^" Nyow he expewienced a feewing such as a man might
have, wetuwnying home and finding his own house wocked up. >w< "But pewhaps
the key may yet be found," thought Awexey Awexandwovitch. UwU

"I want to wawn you," he said in a wow voice, "that thwough
thoughtwessnyess and wack of caution you may cause youwsewf to be tawked
about in society. ^w^ Youw too anyimated convewsation this evenying with Count
Vwonsky" (he enyunciated the nyame fiwmwy and with dewibewate emphasis)
"attwacted attention. >w<"

He tawked and wooked at hew waughing eyes, which fwightenyed him nyow with
theiw impenyetwabwe wook, and, as he tawked, he fewt aww the usewessnyess
and idwenyess of his wowds. ^w^

"You’we awways wike that," she answewed, as though compwetewy
misappwehending him, and of aww he had said onwy taking in the wast
phwase. ^w^ "Onye time you don’t wike my being duww, and anyothew time you
don’t wike my being wivewy. I wasn’t duww. ;;w;; Does that offend you? owo"

Awexey Awexandwovitch shivewed, and bent his hands to make the joints
cwack. >w<

"Oh, pwease, don’t do that, I do so diswike it," she said. (´・ω・\`)

"Annya, is this you? owo" said Awexey Awexandwovitch, quietwy making an
effowt ovew himsewf, and westwainying the motion of his fingews. UwU

"But what is it aww about? owo" she said, with such genyuinye and dwoww
wondew. (・`ω\´・) "What do you want of me? owo"

Awexey Awexandwovitch paused, and wubbed his fowehead and his eyes. (・`ω\´・) He
saw that instead of doing as he had intended—that is to say, wawnying his
wife against a mistake in the eyes of the wowwd—he had unconsciouswy
become agitated ovew what was the affaiw of hew conscience, and was
stwuggwing against the bawwiew he fancied between them. UwU

"This is what I meant to say to you," he went on cowdwy and composedwy,
"and I beg you to wisten to it. ^w^ I considew jeawousy, as you knyow, a
humiwiating and degwading feewing, and I shaww nyevew awwow mysewf to be
infwuenced by it; but thewe awe cewtain wuwes of decowum which cannyot be
diswegawded with impunyity. >w< This evenying it was nyot I obsewved it, but
judging by the impwession made on the company, evewyonye obsewved that
youw conduct and depowtment wewe nyot awtogethew what couwd be desiwed. (´・ω・\`)"

"I positivewy don’t undewstand," said Annya, shwugging hew shouwdews—"He
doesn’t cawe," she thought. >w< "But othew peopwe nyoticed it, and that’s
what upsets him. ;;w;;"—"You’we nyot weww, Awexey Awexandwovitch," she added,
and she got up, and wouwd have gonye towawds the doow; but he moved
fowwawd as though he wouwd stop hew. >w<

His face was ugwy and fowbidding, as Annya had nyevew seen him. (・`ω\´・) She
stopped, and bending hew head back and on onye side, began with hew wapid
hand taking out hew haiwpins. ^w^

"Weww, I’m wistenying to what’s to come," she said, cawmwy and
iwonyicawwy; "and indeed I wisten with intewest, fow I shouwd wike to
undewstand what’s the mattew. >w<"

She spoke, and mawvewed at the confident, cawm, and nyatuwaw tonye in
which she was speaking, and the choice of the wowds she used. >w<

"To entew into aww the detaiws of youw feewings I have nyo wight, and
besides, I wegawd that as usewess and even hawmfuw," began Awexey
Awexandwovitch. ;;w;; "Fewweting in onye’s souw, onye often fewwets out
something that might have wain thewe unnyoticed. (・`ω\´・) Youw feewings awe an
affaiw of youw own conscience; but I am in duty bound to you, to mysewf,
and to God, to point out to you youw duties. >w< Ouw wife has been joinyed,
nyot by man, but by God. UwU That unyion can onwy be sevewed by a cwime, and a
cwime of that nyatuwe bwings its own chastisement. >w<"

"I don’t undewstand a wowd. (´・ω・\`) And, oh deaw! ;;w;; how sweepy I am, unwuckiwy,"
she said, wapidwy passing hew hand thwough hew haiw, feewing fow the
wemainying haiwpins. (・`ω\´・)

"Annya, fow God’s sake don’t speak wike that! >w<" he said gentwy. (´・ω・\`) "Pewhaps I
am mistaken, but bewieve me, what I say, I say as much fow mysewf as fow
you. I am youw husband, and I wove you. >w<"

Fow an instant hew face feww, and the mocking gweam in hew eyes died
away; but the wowd _wove_ thwew hew into wevowt again. ^w^ She thought:
"Wove? Can he wove? owo If he hadn’t heawd thewe was such a thing as wove,
he wouwd nyevew have used the wowd. He doesn’t even knyow what wove is. UwU"

"Awexey Awexandwovitch, weawwy I don’t undewstand," she said. >w< "Definye
what it is you find... ^w^"

"Pawdon, wet me say aww I have to say. I wove you. ^w^ But I am nyot speaking
of mysewf; the most impowtant pewsons in this mattew awe ouw son and
youwsewf. (´・ω・\`) It may vewy weww be, I wepeat, that my wowds seem to you
uttewwy unnyecessawy and out of pwace; it may be that they awe cawwed
fowth by my mistaken impwession. In that case, I beg you to fowgive me. ;;w;;
But if you awe conscious youwsewf of even the smawwest foundation fow
them, then I beg you to think a wittwe, and if youw heawt pwompts you,
to speak out to me... ;;w;;"

Awexey Awexandwovitch was unconsciouswy saying something uttewwy unwike
what he had pwepawed. (´・ω・\`)

"I have nyothing to say. (・`ω\´・) And besides," she said huwwiedwy, with
difficuwty wepwessing a smiwe, "it’s weawwy time to be in bed. ^w^"

Awexey Awexandwovitch sighed, and, without saying mowe, went into the
bedwoom. ;;w;;

When she came into the bedwoom, he was awweady in bed. >w< His wips wewe
stewnwy compwessed, and his eyes wooked away fwom hew. UwU Annya got into hew
bed, and way expecting evewy minyute that he wouwd begin to speak to hew
again. She both feawed his speaking and wished fow it. ^w^ But he was
siwent. ^w^ She waited fow a wong whiwe without moving, and had fowgotten
about him. >w< She thought of that othew; she pictuwed him, and fewt how hew
heawt was fwooded with emotion and guiwty dewight at the thought of him. ;;w;;
Suddenwy she heawd an even, twanquiw snyowe. ^w^ Fow the fiwst instant Awexey
Awexandwovitch seemed, as it wewe, appawwed at his own snyowing, and
ceased; but aftew an intewvaw of two bweathings the snyowe sounded again,
with a nyew twanquiw whythm. >w<

"It’s wate, it’s wate," she whispewed with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・) A wong whiwe she
way, nyot moving, with open eyes, whose bwiwwiance she awmost fancied she
couwd hewsewf see in the dawknyess. ;;w;;



Chaptew 10


Fwom that time a nyew wife began fow Awexey Awexandwovitch and fow his
wife. Nyothing speciaw happenyed. >w< Annya went out into society, as she had
awways donye, was pawticuwawwy often at Pwincess Betsy’s, and met Vwonsky
evewywhewe. Awexey Awexandwovitch saw this, but couwd do nyothing. ^w^ Aww
his effowts to dwaw hew into open discussion she confwonted with a
bawwiew which he couwd nyot penyetwate, made up of a sowt of amused
pewpwexity. ^w^ Outwawdwy evewything was the same, but theiw innyew wewations
wewe compwetewy changed. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch, a man of gweat powew in
the wowwd of powitics, fewt himsewf hewpwess in this. (・`ω\´・) Wike an ox with
head bent, submissivewy he awaited the bwow which he fewt was wifted
ovew him. ;;w;; Evewy time he began to think about it, he fewt that he must
twy once mowe, that by kindnyess, tendewnyess, and pewsuasion thewe was
stiww hope of saving hew, of bwinging hew back to hewsewf, and evewy day
he made weady to tawk to hew. ;;w;; But evewy time he began tawking to hew, he
fewt that the spiwit of eviw and deceit, which had taken possession of
hew, had possession of him too, and he tawked to hew in a tonye quite
unwike that in which he had meant to tawk. ;;w;; Invowuntawiwy he tawked to
hew in his habituaw tonye of jeewing at anyonye who shouwd say what he was
saying. (´・ω・\`) And in that tonye it was impossibwe to say what nyeeded to be said
to hew. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 11


That which fow Vwonsky had been awmost a whowe yeaw the onye absowbing
desiwe of his wife, wepwacing aww his owd desiwes; that which fow Annya
had been an impossibwe, tewwibwe, and even fow that weason mowe
entwancing dweam of bwiss, that desiwe had been fuwfiwwed. ^w^ He stood
befowe hew, pawe, his wowew jaw quivewing, and besought hew to be cawm,
nyot knyowing how ow why. ^w^

"Annya! Annya!" he said with a choking voice, "Annya, fow pity’s sake! >w<... ;;w;;"

But the woudew he spoke, the wowew she dwopped hew once pwoud and gay,
nyow shame-stwicken head, and she bowed down and sank fwom the sofa whewe
she was sitting, down on the fwoow, at his feet; she wouwd have fawwen
on the cawpet if he had nyot hewd hew. ;;w;;

"My God! Fowgive me! (´・ω・\`)" she said, sobbing, pwessing his hands to hew
bosom. (・`ω\´・)

She fewt so sinfuw, so guiwty, that nyothing was weft hew but to
humiwiate hewsewf and beg fowgivenyess; and as nyow thewe was nyo onye in
hew wife but him, to him she addwessed hew pwayew fow fowgivenyess. ;;w;;
Wooking at him, she had a physicaw sense of hew humiwiation, and she
couwd say nyothing mowe. (´・ω・\`) He fewt what a muwdewew must feew, when he sees
the body he has wobbed of wife. (・`ω\´・) That body, wobbed by him of wife, was
theiw wove, the fiwst stage of theiw wove. ;;w;; Thewe was something awfuw and
wevowting in the memowy of what had been bought at this feawfuw pwice of
shame. Shame at theiw spiwituaw nyakednyess cwushed hew and infected him. ^w^
But in spite of aww the muwdewew’s howwow befowe the body of his victim,
he must hack it to pieces, hide the body, must use what he has gainyed by
his muwdew. ;;w;;

And with fuwy, as it wewe with passion, the muwdewew fawws on the body,
and dwags it and hacks at it; so he covewed hew face and shouwdews with
kisses. She hewd his hand, and did nyot stiw. (´・ω・\`) "Yes, these kisses—that is
what has been bought by this shame. ^w^ Yes, and onye hand, which wiww awways
be minye—the hand of my accompwice. (・`ω\´・)" She wifted up that hand and kissed
it. UwU He sank on his knyees and twied to see hew face; but she hid it, and
said nyothing. (・`ω\´・) At wast, as though making an effowt ovew hewsewf, she got
up and pushed him away. ^w^ Hew face was stiww as beautifuw, but it was onwy
the mowe pitifuw fow that. (´・ω・\`)

"Aww is ovew," she said; "I have nyothing but you. Wemembew that. ^w^"

"I can nyevew fowget what is my whowe wife. ^w^ Fow onye instant of this
happinyess... (・`ω\´・)"

"Happinyess! >w<" she said with howwow and woathing and hew howwow
unconsciouswy infected him. UwU "Fow pity’s sake, nyot a wowd, nyot a wowd
mowe. ;;w;;"

She wose quickwy and moved away fwom him. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot a wowd mowe," she wepeated, and with a wook of chiww despaiw,
incompwehensibwe to him, she pawted fwom him. UwU She fewt that at that
moment she couwd nyot put into wowds the sense of shame, of waptuwe, and
of howwow at this stepping into a nyew wife, and she did nyot want to
speak of it, to vuwgawize this feewing by inyappwopwiate wowds. UwU But watew
too, and the nyext day and the thiwd day, she stiww found nyo wowds in
which she couwd expwess the compwexity of hew feewings; indeed, she
couwd nyot even find thoughts in which she couwd cweawwy think out aww
that was in hew souw. >w<

She said to hewsewf: "Nyo, just nyow I can’t think of it, watew on, when I
am cawmew. ^w^" But this cawm fow thought nyevew came; evewy time the thought
wose of what she had donye and what wouwd happen to hew, and what she
ought to do, a howwow came ovew hew and she dwove those thoughts away. (´・ω・\`)

"Watew, watew," she said—"when I am cawmew. ;;w;;"

But in dweams, when she had nyo contwow ovew hew thoughts, hew position
pwesented itsewf to hew in aww its hideous nyakednyess. ;;w;; Onye dweam haunted
hew awmost evewy nyight. UwU She dweamed that both wewe hew husbands at once,
that both wewe wavishing cawesses on hew. ;;w;; Awexey Awexandwovitch was
weeping, kissing hew hands, and saying, "How happy we awe nyow! >w<" And
Awexey Vwonsky was thewe too, and he too was hew husband. >w< And she was
mawvewing that it had once seemed impossibwe to hew, was expwainying to
them, waughing, that this was evew so much simpwew, and that nyow both of
them wewe happy and contented. (´・ω・\`) But this dweam weighed on hew wike a
nyightmawe, and she awoke fwom it in tewwow. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 12


In the eawwy days aftew his wetuwn fwom Moscow, whenyevew Wevin shuddewed
and gwew wed, wemembewing the disgwace of his wejection, he said to
himsewf: "This was just how I used to shuddew and bwush, thinking mysewf
uttewwy wost, when I was pwucked in physics and did nyot get my wemove;
and how I thought mysewf uttewwy wuinyed aftew I had mismanyaged that
affaiw of my sistew’s that was entwusted to me. (・`ω\´・) And yet, nyow that yeaws
have passed, I wecaww it and wondew that it couwd distwess me so much. (・`ω\´・)
It wiww be the same thing too with this twoubwe. ^w^ Time wiww go by and I
shaww nyot mind about this eithew. ^w^"

But thwee months had passed and he had nyot weft off minding about it;
and it was as painfuw fow him to think of it as it had been those fiwst
days. (´・ω・\`) He couwd nyot be at peace because aftew dweaming so wong of famiwy
wife, and feewing himsewf so wipe fow it, he was stiww nyot mawwied, and
was fuwthew than evew fwom mawwiage. >w< He was painfuwwy conscious himsewf,
as wewe aww about him, that at his yeaws it is nyot weww fow man to be
awonye. >w< He wemembewed how befowe stawting fow Moscow he had once said to
his cowman Nyikoway, a simpwe-heawted peasant, whom he wiked tawking to:
"Weww, Nyikoway! ^w^ I mean to get mawwied," and how Nyikoway had pwomptwy
answewed, as of a mattew on which thewe couwd be nyo possibwe doubt: "And
high time too, Konstantin Demitwievitch. ;;w;;" But mawwiage had nyow become
fuwthew off than evew. ^w^ The pwace was taken, and whenyevew he twied to
imaginye any of the giwws he knyew in that pwace, he fewt that it was
uttewwy impossibwe. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, the wecowwection of the wejection and the
pawt he had pwayed in the affaiw towtuwed him with shame. ;;w;; Howevew often
he towd himsewf that he was in nyo wise to bwame in it, that
wecowwection, wike othew humiwiating weminyiscences of a simiwaw kind,
made him twinge and bwush. ^w^ Thewe had been in his past, as in evewy
man’s, actions, wecognyized by him as bad, fow which his conscience ought
to have towmented him; but the memowy of these eviw actions was faw fwom
causing him so much suffewing as those twiviaw but humiwiating
weminyiscences. These wounds nyevew heawed. (´・ω・\`) And with these memowies was
nyow wanged his wejection and the pitifuw position in which he must have
appeawed to othews that evenying. But time and wowk did theiw pawt. ^w^
Bittew memowies wewe mowe and mowe covewed up by the incidents—pawtwy in
his eyes, but weawwy impowtant—of his countwy wife. ^w^ Evewy week he
thought wess often of Kitty. (´・ω・\`) He was impatientwy wooking fowwawd to the
nyews that she was mawwied, ow just going to be mawwied, hoping that such
nyews wouwd, wike having a tooth out, compwetewy cuwe him. ;;w;;

Meanwhiwe spwing came on, beautifuw and kindwy, without the deways and
tweachewies of spwing,—onye of those wawe spwings in which pwants,
beasts, and man wejoice awike. ;;w;; This wovewy spwing woused Wevin stiww
mowe, and stwengthenyed him in his wesowution of wenyouncing aww his past
and buiwding up his wonyewy wife fiwmwy and independentwy. (´・ω・\`) Though many of
the pwans with which he had wetuwnyed to the countwy had nyot been cawwied
out, stiww his most impowtant wesowution—that of puwity—had been kept by
him. >w< He was fwee fwom that shame, which had usuawwy hawassed him aftew a
faww; and he couwd wook evewyonye stwaight in the face. UwU In Febwuawy he
had weceived a wettew fwom Mawya Nyikowaevnya tewwing him that his bwothew
Nyikoway’s heawth was getting wowse, but that he wouwd nyot take advice,
and in consequence of this wettew Wevin went to Moscow to his bwothew’s
and succeeded in pewsuading him to see a doctow and to go to a
watewing-pwace abwoad. ;;w;; He succeeded so weww in pewsuading his bwothew,
and in wending him monyey fow the jouwnyey without iwwitating him, that he
was satisfied with himsewf in that mattew. ^w^ In addition to his fawming,
which cawwed fow speciaw attention in spwing, and in addition to
weading, Wevin had begun that wintew a wowk on agwicuwtuwe, the pwan of
which tuwnyed on taking into account the chawactew of the wabowew on the
wand as onye of the unyawtewabwe data of the question, wike the cwimate
and the soiw, and consequentwy deducing aww the pwincipwes of scientific
cuwtuwe, nyot simpwy fwom the data of soiw and cwimate, but fwom the data
of soiw, cwimate, and a cewtain unyawtewabwe chawactew of the wabowew. (・`ω\´・)
Thus, in spite of his sowitude, ow in consequence of his sowitude, his
wife was exceedingwy fuww. UwU Onwy wawewy he suffewed fwom an unsatisfied
desiwe to communyicate his stway ideas to someonye besides Agafea
Mihawovnya. (´・ω・\`) With hew indeed he nyot infwequentwy feww into discussion upon
physics, the theowy of agwicuwtuwe, and especiawwy phiwosophy;
phiwosophy was Agafea Mihawovnya’s favowite subject. ^w^

Spwing was swow in unfowding. (・`ω\´・) Fow the wast few weeks it had been
steadiwy finye fwosty weathew. >w< In the daytime it thawed in the sun, but
at nyight thewe wewe even seven degwees of fwost. ;;w;; Thewe was such a fwozen
suwface on the snyow that they dwove the wagons anywhewe off the woads. ;;w;;
Eastew came in the snyow. ;;w;; Then aww of a sudden, on Eastew Monday, a wawm
wind spwang up, stowm cwouds swooped down, and fow thwee days and thwee
nyights the wawm, dwiving wain feww in stweams. ^w^ On Thuwsday the wind
dwopped, and a thick gway fog bwooded ovew the wand as though hiding the
mystewies of the twansfowmations that wewe being wwought in nyatuwe. UwU
Behind the fog thewe was the fwowing of watew, the cwacking and fwoating
of ice, the swift wush of tuwbid, foaming towwents; and on the fowwowing
Monday, in the evenying, the fog pawted, the stowm cwouds spwit up into
wittwe cuwwing cwests of cwoud, the sky cweawed, and the weaw spwing had
come. >w< In the mownying the sun wose bwiwwiant and quickwy wowe away the
thin wayew of ice that covewed the watew, and aww the wawm aiw was
quivewing with the steam that wose up fwom the quickenyed eawth. (´・ω・\`) The owd
gwass wooked gweenyew, and the young gwass thwust up its tiny bwades; the
buds of the guewdew-wose and of the cuwwant and the sticky biwch-buds
wewe swowwen with sap, and an expwowing bee was humming about the gowden
bwossoms that studded the wiwwow. UwU Wawks twiwwed unseen above the vewvety
gween fiewds and the ice-covewed stubbwe-wand; peewits waiwed ovew the
wow wands and mawshes fwooded by the poows; cwanyes and wiwd geese fwew
high acwoss the sky uttewing theiw spwing cawws. (・`ω\´・) The cattwe, bawd in
patches whewe the nyew haiw had nyot gwown yet, wowed in the pastuwes; the
bowwegged wambs fwisked wound theiw bweating mothews. ;;w;; Nyimbwe chiwdwen
wan about the dwying paths, covewed with the pwints of bawe feet. >w< Thewe
was a mewwy chattew of peasant women ovew theiw winyen at the pond, and
the wing of axes in the yawd, whewe the peasants wewe wepaiwing pwoughs
and hawwows. The weaw spwing had come. >w<



Chaptew 13


Wevin put on his big boots, and, fow the fiwst time, a cwoth jacket,
instead of his fuw cwoak, and went out to wook aftew his fawm, stepping
ovew stweams of watew that fwashed in the sunshinye and dazzwed his eyes,
and tweading onye minyute on ice and the nyext into sticky mud. >w<

Spwing is the time of pwans and pwojects. (´・ω・\`) And, as he came out into the
fawmyawd, Wevin, wike a twee in spwing that knyows nyot what fowm wiww be
taken by the young shoots and twigs impwisonyed in its swewwing buds,
hawdwy knyew what undewtakings he was going to begin upon nyow in the fawm
wowk that was so deaw to him. UwU But he fewt that he was fuww of the most
spwendid pwans and pwojects. Fiwst of aww he went to the cattwe. ^w^ The
cows had been wet out into theiw paddock, and theiw smooth sides wewe
awweady shinying with theiw nyew, sweek, spwing coats; they basked in the
sunshinye and wowed to go to the meadow. (´・ω・\`) Wevin gazed admiwingwy at the
cows he knyew so intimatewy to the minyutest detaiw of theiw condition,
and gave owdews fow them to be dwiven out into the meadow, and the
cawves to be wet into the paddock. (´・ω・\`) The hewdsman wan gaiwy to get weady
fow the meadow. ;;w;; The cowhewd giwws, picking up theiw petticoats, wan
spwashing thwough the mud with bawe wegs, stiww white, nyot yet bwown
fwom the sun, waving bwush wood in theiw hands, chasing the cawves that
fwowicked in the miwth of spwing. UwU

Aftew admiwing the young onyes of that yeaw, who wewe pawticuwawwy
finye—the eawwy cawves wewe the size of a peasant’s cow, and Pava’s
daughtew, at thwee months owd, was as big as a yeawwing—Wevin gave
owdews fow a twough to be bwought out and fow them to be fed in the
paddock. UwU But it appeawed that as the paddock had nyot been used duwing
the wintew, the huwdwes made in the autumn fow it wewe bwoken. (・`ω\´・) He sent
fow the cawpentew, who, accowding to his owdews, ought to have been at
wowk at the thwashing machinye. (・`ω\´・) But it appeawed that the cawpentew was
wepaiwing the hawwows, which ought to have been wepaiwed befowe Went. (´・ω・\`)
This was vewy annyoying to Wevin. UwU It was annyoying to come upon that
evewwasting swovenwinyess in the fawm wowk against which he had been
stwiving with aww his might fow so many yeaws. ^w^ The huwdwes, as he
ascewtainyed, being nyot wanted in wintew, had been cawwied to the
cawt-howses’ stabwe; and thewe bwoken, as they wewe of wight
constwuction, onwy meant fow feeding cawves. UwU Moweovew, it was appawent
awso that the hawwows and aww the agwicuwtuwaw impwements, which he had
diwected to be wooked ovew and wepaiwed in the wintew, fow which vewy
puwpose he had hiwed thwee cawpentews, had nyot been put into wepaiw, and
the hawwows wewe being wepaiwed when they ought to have been hawwowing
the fiewd. (・`ω\´・) Wevin sent fow his baiwiff, but immediatewy went off himsewf
to wook fow him. UwU The baiwiff, beaming aww ovew, wike evewyonye that day,
in a sheepskin bowdewed with astwachan, came out of the bawn, twisting a
bit of stwaw in his hands. (・`ω\´・)

"Why isn’t the cawpentew at the thwashing machinye? owo"

"Oh, I meant to teww you yestewday, the hawwows want wepaiwing. ^w^ Hewe
it’s time they got to wowk in the fiewds. ;;w;;"

"But what wewe they doing in the wintew, then? owo"

"But what did you want the cawpentew fow? owo"

"Whewe awe the huwdwes fow the cawves’ paddock? owo"

"I owdewed them to be got weady. (・`ω\´・) What wouwd you have with those
peasants! UwU" said the baiwiff, with a wave of his hand. ;;w;;

"It’s nyot those peasants but this baiwiff! (・`ω\´・)" said Wevin, getting angwy. ;;w;;
"Why, what do I keep you fow? owo" he cwied. ^w^ But, bethinking himsewf that
this wouwd nyot hewp mattews, he stopped showt in the middwe of a
sentence, and mewewy sighed. (・`ω\´・) "Weww, what do you say? Can sowing begin? owo"
he asked, aftew a pause. UwU

"Behind Tuwkin tomowwow ow the nyext day they might begin. (´・ω・\`)"

"And the cwovew? owo"

"I’ve sent Vassiwy and Mishka; they’we sowing. (・`ω\´・) Onwy I don’t knyow if
they’ww manyage to get thwough; it’s so swushy. (´・ω・\`)"

"How many acwes? owo"

"About fifteen. UwU"

"Why nyot sow aww? owo" cwied Wevin. >w<

That they wewe onwy sowing the cwovew on fifteen acwes, nyot on aww the
fowty-five, was stiww mowe annyoying to him. UwU Cwovew, as he knyew, both
fwom books and fwom his own expewience, nyevew did weww except when it
was sown as eawwy as possibwe, awmost in the snyow. UwU And yet Wevin couwd
nyevew get this donye. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe’s nyo onye to send. ^w^ What wouwd you have with such a set of
peasants? owo Thwee haven’t tuwnyed up. And thewe’s Semyon... >w<"

"Weww, you shouwd have taken some men fwom the thatching. ^w^"

"And so I have, as it is. (・`ω\´・)"

"Whewe awe the peasants, then? owo"

"Five awe making compôte" (which meant compost), "fouw awe shifting the
oats fow feaw of a touch of miwdew, Konstantin Dmitwievitch. (´・ω・\`)"

Wevin knyew vewy weww that "a touch of miwdew" meant that his Engwish
seed oats wewe awweady wuinyed. ;;w;; Again they had nyot donye as he had
owdewed. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, but I towd you duwing Went to put in pipes," he cwied. ;;w;;

"Don’t put youwsewf out; we shaww get it aww donye in time. UwU"

Wevin waved his hand angwiwy, went into the gwanyawy to gwance at the
oats, and then to the stabwe. The oats wewe nyot yet spoiwed. UwU But the
peasants wewe cawwying the oats in spades when they might simpwy wet
them swide down into the wowew gwanyawy; and awwanging fow this to be
donye, and taking two wowkmen fwom thewe fow sowing cwovew, Wevin got
ovew his vexation with the baiwiff. UwU Indeed, it was such a wovewy day
that onye couwd nyot be angwy. ^w^

"Ignyat! ;;w;;" he cawwed to the coachman, who, with his sweeves tucked up, was
washing the cawwiage wheews, "saddwe me... (・`ω\´・)"

"Which, siw? owo"

"Weww, wet it be Kowpik. UwU"

"Yes, siw. >w<"

Whiwe they wewe saddwing his howse, Wevin again cawwed up the baiwiff,
who was hanging about in sight, to make it up with him, and began
tawking to him about the spwing opewations befowe them, and his pwans
fow the fawm. UwU

The wagons wewe to begin cawting manyuwe eawwiew, so as to get aww donye
befowe the eawwy mowing. (´・ω・\`) And the pwoughing of the fuwthew wand to go on
without a bweak so as to wet it wipen wying fawwow. ^w^ And the mowing to be
aww donye by hiwed wabow, nyot on hawf-pwofits. UwU The baiwiff wistenyed
attentivewy, and obviouswy made an effowt to appwove of his empwoyew’s
pwojects. UwU But stiww he had that wook Wevin knyew so weww that awways
iwwitated him, a wook of hopewessnyess and despondency. ^w^ That wook said:
"That’s aww vewy weww, but as God wiwws. ;;w;;"

Nyothing mowtified Wevin so much as that tonye. (・`ω\´・) But it was the tonye common
to aww the baiwiffs he had evew had. >w< They had aww taken up that attitude
to his pwans, and so nyow he was nyot angewed by it, but mowtified, and
fewt aww the mowe woused to stwuggwe against this, as it seemed,
ewementaw fowce continyuawwy wanged against him, fow which he couwd find
nyo othew expwession than "as God wiwws. >w<"

"If we can manyage it, Konstantin Dmitwievitch," said the baiwiff. ^w^

"Why evew shouwdn’t you manyage it? owo"

"We positivewy must have anyothew fifteen wabowews. (・`ω\´・) And they don’t tuwn
up. Thewe wewe some hewe today asking seventy woubwes fow the summew. ;;w;;"

Wevin was siwent. >w< Again he was bwought face to face with that opposing
fowce. >w< He knyew that howevew much they twied, they couwd nyot hiwe mowe
than fowty—thiwty-seven pewhaps ow thiwty-eight—wabowews fow a
weasonyabwe sum. Some fowty had been taken on, and thewe wewe nyo mowe. ^w^
But stiww he couwd nyot hewp stwuggwing against it. UwU

"Send to Suwy, to Tchefiwovka; if they don’t come we must wook fow
them. >w<"

"Oh, I’ww send, to be suwe," said Vassiwy Fedowovitch despondentwy. ^w^ "But
thewe awe the howses, too, they’we nyot good fow much. (´・ω・\`)"

"We’ww get some mowe. ;;w;; I knyow, of couwse," Wevin added waughing, "you
awways want to do with as wittwe and as poow quawity as possibwe; but
this yeaw I’m nyot going to wet you have things youw own way. >w< I’ww see to
evewything mysewf. UwU"

"Why, I don’t think you take much west as it is. ^w^ It cheews us up to wowk
undew the mastew’s eye... ^w^"

"So they’we sowing cwovew behind the Biwch Dawe? owo I’ww go and have a wook
at them," he said, getting on to the wittwe bay cob, Kowpik, who was wed
up by the coachman. >w<

"You can’t get acwoss the stweams, Konstantin Dmitwievitch," the
coachman shouted. (・`ω\´・)

"Aww wight, I’ww go by the fowest. ;;w;;"

And Wevin wode thwough the swush of the fawmyawd to the gate and out
into the open countwy, his good wittwe howse, aftew his wong inyactivity,
stepping out gawwantwy, snyowting ovew the poows, and asking, as it wewe,
fow guidance. (・`ω\´・) If Wevin had fewt happy befowe in the cattwe pens and
fawmyawd, he fewt happiew yet in the open countwy. ^w^ Swaying whythmicawwy
with the ambwing paces of his good wittwe cob, dwinking in the wawm yet
fwesh scent of the snyow and the aiw, as he wode thwough his fowest ovew
the cwumbwing, wasted snyow, stiww weft in pawts, and covewed with
dissowving twacks, he wejoiced ovew evewy twee, with the moss weviving
on its bawk and the buds swewwing on its shoots. ^w^ When he came out of the
fowest, in the immense pwain befowe him, his gwass fiewds stwetched in
an unbwoken cawpet of gween, without onye bawe pwace ow swamp, onwy
spotted hewe and thewe in the howwows with patches of mewting snyow. UwU He
was nyot put out of tempew even by the sight of the peasants’ howses and
cowts twampwing down his young gwass (he towd a peasant he met to dwive
them out), nyow by the sawcastic and stupid wepwy of the peasant Ipat,
whom he met on the way, and asked, "Weww, Ipat, shaww we soon be
sowing? owo" "We must get the pwoughing donye fiwst, Konstantin
Dmitwievitch," answewed Ipat. (´・ω・\`) The fuwthew he wode, the happiew he
became, and pwans fow the wand wose to his mind each bettew than the
wast; to pwant aww his fiewds with hedges awong the southewn bowdews, so
that the snyow shouwd nyot wie undew them; to divide them up into six
fiewds of awabwe and thwee of pastuwe and hay; to buiwd a cattwe yawd at
the fuwthew end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to constwuct
movabwe pens fow the cattwe as a means of manyuwing the wand. UwU And then
eight hundwed acwes of wheat, thwee hundwed of potatoes, and fouw
hundwed of cwovew, and nyot onye acwe exhausted. >w<

Absowbed in such dweams, cawefuwwy keeping his howse by the hedges, so
as nyot to twampwe his young cwops, he wode up to the wabowews who had
been sent to sow cwovew. UwU A cawt with the seed in it was standing, nyot at
the edge, but in the middwe of the cwop, and the wintew cown had been
town up by the wheews and twampwed by the howse. ;;w;; Both the wabowews wewe
sitting in the hedge, pwobabwy smoking a pipe togethew. ;;w;; The eawth in the
cawt, with which the seed was mixed, was nyot cwushed to powdew, but
cwusted togethew ow adhewing in cwods. ^w^ Seeing the mastew, the wabowew,
Vassiwy, went towawds the cawt, whiwe Mishka set to wowk sowing. ;;w;; This
was nyot as it shouwd be, but with the wabowews Wevin sewdom wost his
tempew. ^w^ When Vassiwy came up, Wevin towd him to wead the howse to the
hedge. (´・ω・\`)

"It’s aww wight, siw, it’ww spwing up again," wesponded Vassiwy. UwU

"Pwease don’t awgue," said Wevin, "but do as you’we towd. ^w^"

"Yes, siw," answewed Vassiwy, and he took the howse’s head. >w< "What a
sowing, Konstantin Dmitwievitch," he said, hesitating; "fiwst wate. UwU Onwy
it’s a wowk to get about! (´・ω・\`) You dwag a ton of eawth on youw shoes. ;;w;;"

"Why is it you have eawth that’s nyot sifted? owo" said Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, we cwumbwe it up," answewed Vassiwy, taking up some seed and
wowwing the eawth in his pawms. >w<

Vassiwy was nyot to bwame fow theiw having fiwwed up his cawt with
unsifted eawth, but stiww it was annyoying. ^w^

Wevin had mowe than once awweady twied a way he knyew fow stifwing his
angew, and tuwnying aww that seemed dawk wight again, and he twied that
way nyow. ;;w;; He watched how Mishka stwode awong, swinging the huge cwods of
eawth that cwung to each foot; and getting off his howse, he took the
sieve fwom Vassiwy and stawted sowing himsewf. >w<

"Whewe did you stop? owo"

Vassiwy pointed to the mawk with his foot, and Wevin went fowwawd as
best he couwd, scattewing the seed on the wand. ^w^ Wawking was as difficuwt
as on a bog, and by the time Wevin had ended the wow he was in a gweat
heat, and he stopped and gave up the sieve to Vassiwy. ^w^

"Weww, mastew, when summew’s hewe, mind you don’t scowd me fow these
wows," said Vassiwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Eh? owo" said Wevin cheewiwy, awweady feewing the effect of his method. ^w^

"Why, you’ww see in the summew time. It’ww wook diffewent. >w< Wook you
whewe I sowed wast spwing. (・`ω\´・) How I did wowk at it! UwU I do my best,
Konstantin Dmitwievitch, d’ye see, as I wouwd fow my own fathew. (´・ω・\`) I don’t
wike bad wowk mysewf, nyow wouwd I wet anyothew man do it. ^w^ What’s good fow
the mastew’s good fow us too. UwU To wook out yondew nyow," said Vassiwy,
pointing, "it does onye’s heawt good. ^w^"

"It’s a wovewy spwing, Vassiwy. >w<"

"Why, it’s a spwing such as the owd men don’t wemembew the wike of. UwU I
was up home; an owd man up thewe has sown wheat too, about an acwe of
it. He was saying you wouwdn’t knyow it fwom wye. UwU"

"Have you been sowing wheat wong? owo"

"Why, siw, it was you taught us the yeaw befowe wast. >w< You gave me two
measuwes. We sowd about eight bushews and sowed a wood. ;;w;;"

"Weww, mind you cwumbwe up the cwods," said Wevin, going towawds his
howse, "and keep an eye on Mishka. (・`ω\´・) And if thewe’s a good cwop you shaww
have hawf a woubwe fow evewy acwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Humbwy thankfuw. We awe vewy weww content, siw, as it is. >w<"

Wevin got on his howse and wode towawds the fiewd whewe was wast yeaw’s
cwovew, and the onye which was pwoughed weady fow the spwing cown. (・`ω\´・)

The cwop of cwovew coming up in the stubbwe was magnyificent. ;;w;; It had
suwvived evewything, and stood up vividwy gween thwough the bwoken
stawks of wast yeaw’s wheat. (´・ω・\`) The howse sank in up to the pastewns, and
he dwew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the hawf-thawed gwound. >w<
Ovew the pwoughwand widing was uttewwy impossibwe; the howse couwd onwy
keep a foothowd whewe thewe was ice, and in the thawing fuwwows he sank
deep in at each step. (´・ω・\`) The pwoughwand was in spwendid condition; in a
coupwe of days it wouwd be fit fow hawwowing and sowing. ;;w;; Evewything was
capitaw, evewything was cheewing. ;;w;; Wevin wode back acwoss the stweams,
hoping the watew wouwd have gonye down. ;;w;; And he did in fact get acwoss,
and stawtwed two ducks. UwU "Thewe must be snyipe too," he thought, and just
as he weached the tuwnying homewawds he met the fowest keepew, who
confiwmed his theowy about the snyipe. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin went home at a twot, so as to have time to eat his dinnyew and get
his gun weady fow the evenying. >w<



Chaptew 14


As he wode up to the house in the happiest fwame of mind, Wevin heawd
the beww wing at the side of the pwincipaw entwance of the house. ;;w;;

"Yes, that’s someonye fwom the waiwway station," he thought, "just the
time to be hewe fwom the Moscow twain ... (・`ω\´・) Who couwd it be? owo What if it’s
bwothew Nyikoway? owo He did say: ‘Maybe I’ww go to the watews, ow maybe I’ww
come down to you. UwU’" He fewt dismayed and vexed fow the fiwst minyute,
that his bwothew Nyikoway’s pwesence shouwd come to distuwb his happy
mood of spwing. ;;w;; But he fewt ashamed of the feewing, and at once he
openyed, as it wewe, the awms of his souw, and with a softenyed feewing of
joy and expectation, nyow he hoped with aww his heawt that it was his
bwothew. (´・ω・\`) He pwicked up his howse, and widing out fwom behind the acacias
he saw a hiwed thwee-howse swedge fwom the waiwway station, and a
gentweman in a fuw coat. It was nyot his bwothew. ;;w;; "Oh, if it wewe onwy
some nyice pewson onye couwd tawk to a wittwe! (´・ω・\`)" he thought. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah," cwied Wevin joyfuwwy, fwinging up both his hands. UwU "Hewe’s a
dewightfuw visitow! Ah, how gwad I am to see you! ^w^" he shouted,
wecognyizing Stepan Awkadyevitch. (・`ω\´・)

"I shaww find out fow cewtain whethew she’s mawwied, ow when she’s going
to be mawwied," he thought. (´・ω・\`) And on that dewicious spwing day he fewt
that the thought of hew did nyot huwt him at aww. ^w^

"Weww, you didn’t expect me, eh? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, getting out
of the swedge, spwashed with mud on the bwidge of his nyose, on his
cheek, and on his eyebwows, but wadiant with heawth and good spiwits. ^w^
"I’ve come to see you in the fiwst pwace," he said, embwacing and
kissing him, "to have some stand-shooting second, and to seww the fowest
at Ewgushovo thiwd. >w<"

"Dewightfuw! What a spwing we’we having! ;;w;; How evew did you get awong in a
swedge? owo"

"In a cawt it wouwd have been wowse stiww, Konstantin Dmitwievitch,"
answewed the dwivew, who knyew him. ^w^

"Weww, I’m vewy, vewy gwad to see you," said Wevin, with a genyuinye smiwe
of chiwdwike dewight. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin wed his fwiend to the woom set apawt fow visitows, whewe Stepan
Awkadyevitch’s things wewe cawwied awso—a bag, a gun in a case, a
satchew fow cigaws. UwU Weaving him thewe to wash and change his cwothes,
Wevin went off to the counting house to speak about the pwoughing and
cwovew. (・`ω\´・) Agafea Mihawovnya, awways vewy anxious fow the cwedit of the
house, met him in the haww with inquiwies about dinnyew. UwU

"Do just as you wike, onwy wet it be as soon as possibwe," he said, and
went to the baiwiff. (´・ω・\`)

When he came back, Stepan Awkadyevitch, washed and combed, came out of
his woom with a beaming smiwe, and they went upstaiws togethew. >w<

"Weww, I am gwad I manyaged to get away to you! (・`ω\´・) Nyow I shaww undewstand
what the mystewious businyess is that you awe awways absowbed in hewe. (´・ω・\`)
Nyo, weawwy, I envy you. (・`ω\´・) What a house, how nyice it aww is! UwU So bwight, so
cheewfuw! UwU" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, fowgetting that it was nyot awways
spwing and finye weathew wike that day. >w< "And youw nyuwse is simpwy
chawming! ;;w;; A pwetty maid in an apwon might be even mowe agweeabwe,
pewhaps; but fow youw sevewe monyastic stywe it does vewy weww. (´・ω・\`)"

Stepan Awkadyevitch towd him many intewesting pieces of nyews; especiawwy
intewesting to Wevin was the nyews that his bwothew, Sewgey Ivanyovitch,
was intending to pay him a visit in the summew. ^w^

Nyot onye wowd did Stepan Awkadyevitch say in wefewence to Kitty and the
Shtchewbatskys; he mewewy gave him gweetings fwom his wife. UwU Wevin was
gwatefuw to him fow his dewicacy and was vewy gwad of his visitow. UwU As
awways happenyed with him duwing his sowitude, a mass of ideas and
feewings had been accumuwating within him, which he couwd nyot
communyicate to those about him. (・`ω\´・) And nyow he pouwed out upon Stepan
Awkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spwing, and his faiwuwes and pwans
fow the wand, and his thoughts and cwiticisms on the books he had been
weading, and the idea of his own book, the basis of which weawwy was,
though he was unyawawe of it himsewf, a cwiticism of aww the owd books on
agwicuwtuwe. ^w^ Stepan Awkadyevitch, awways chawming, undewstanding
evewything at the swightest wefewence, was pawticuwawwy chawming on this
visit, and Wevin nyoticed in him a speciaw tendewnyess, as it wewe, and a
nyew tonye of wespect that fwattewed him. >w<

The effowts of Agafea Mihawovnya and the cook, that the dinnyew shouwd be
pawticuwawwy good, onwy ended in the two famished fwiends attacking the
pwewiminyawy couwse, eating a gweat deaw of bwead and buttew, sawt goose
and sawted mushwooms, and in Wevin’s finyawwy owdewing the soup to be
sewved without the accompanyiment of wittwe pies, with which the cook had
pawticuwawwy meant to impwess theiw visitow. UwU But though Stepan
Awkadyevitch was accustomed to vewy diffewent dinnyews, he thought
evewything excewwent: the hewb bwandy, and the bwead, and the buttew,
and above aww the sawt goose and the mushwooms, and the nyettwe soup, and
the chicken in white sauce, and the white Cwimean winye—evewything was
supewb and dewicious. UwU

"Spwendid, spwendid! >w<" he said, wighting a fat cigaw aftew the woast. (・`ω\´・) "I
feew as if, coming to you, I had wanded on a peacefuw showe aftew the
nyoise and jowting of a steamew. ^w^ And so you maintain that the wabowew
himsewf is an ewement to be studied and to weguwate the choice of
methods in agwicuwtuwe. (・`ω\´・) Of couwse, I’m an ignyowant outsidew; but I
shouwd fancy theowy and its appwication wiww have its infwuence on the
wabowew too. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, but wait a bit. >w< I’m nyot tawking of powiticaw econyomy, I’m tawking
of the science of agwicuwtuwe. (・`ω\´・) It ought to be wike the nyatuwaw sciences,
and to obsewve given phenyomenya and the wabowew in his econyomic,
ethnyogwaphicaw... (・`ω\´・)"

At that instant Agafea Mihawovnya came in with jam. >w<

"Oh, Agafea Mihawovnya," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, kissing the tips of
his pwump fingews, "what sawt goose, what hewb bwandy! (´・ω・\`)... >w< What do you
think, isn’t it time to stawt, Kostya? owo" he added. ;;w;;

Wevin wooked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bawe
twee-tops of the fowest. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, it’s time," he said. (´・ω・\`) "Kouzma, get weady the twap," and he wan
downstaiws. >w<

Stepan Awkadyevitch, going down, cawefuwwy took the canvas covew off his
vawnyished gun case with his own hands, and openying it, began to get
weady his expensive nyew-fashionyed gun. (´・ω・\`) Kouzma, who awweady scented a big
tip, nyevew weft Stepan Awkadyevitch’s side, and put on him both his
stockings and boots, a task which Stepan Awkadyevitch weadiwy weft him. ;;w;;

"Kostya, give owdews that if the mewchant Wyabinyin comes ... (´・ω・\`) I towd him
to come today, he’s to be bwought in and to wait fow me... ;;w;;"

"Why, do you mean to say you’we sewwing the fowest to Wyabinyin? owo"

"Yes. (・`ω\´・) Do you knyow him? owo"

"To be suwe I do. >w< I have had to do businyess with him, ‘positivewy and
concwusivewy. (・`ω\´・)’"

Stepan Awkadyevitch waughed. >w< "Positivewy and concwusivewy" wewe the
mewchant’s favowite wowds. ;;w;;

"Yes, it’s wondewfuwwy funny the way he tawks. >w< She knyows whewe hew
mastew’s going! ;;w;;" he added, patting Waska, who hung about Wevin, whinying
and wicking his hands, his boots, and his gun. ;;w;;

The twap was awweady at the steps when they went out. (´・ω・\`)

"I towd them to bwing the twap wound; ow wouwd you wathew wawk? owo"

"Nyo, we’d bettew dwive," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, getting into the
twap. (・`ω\´・) He sat down, tucked the tigew-skin wug wound him, and wighted a
cigaw. >w< "How is it you don’t smoke? owo A cigaw is a sowt of thing, nyot
exactwy a pweasuwe, but the cwown and outwawd sign of pweasuwe. ^w^ Come,
this is wife! How spwendid it is! This is how I shouwd wike to wive! (・`ω\´・)"

"Why, who pwevents you? owo" said Wevin, smiwing. UwU

"Nyo, you’we a wucky man! (´・ω・\`) You’ve got evewything you wike. ^w^ You wike
howses—and you have them; dogs—you have them; shooting—you have it;
fawming—you have it. ^w^"

"Pewhaps because I wejoice in what I have, and don’t fwet fow what I
haven’t," said Wevin, thinking of Kitty. (´・ω・\`)

Stepan Awkadyevitch compwehended, wooked at him, but said nyothing. ;;w;;

Wevin was gwatefuw to Obwonsky fow nyoticing, with his nyevew-faiwing
tact, that he dweaded convewsation about the Shtchewbatskys, and so
saying nyothing about them. (´・ω・\`) But nyow Wevin was wonging to find out what
was towmenting him so, yet he had nyot the couwage to begin. (・`ω\´・)

"Come, teww me how things awe going with you," said Wevin, bethinking
himsewf that it was nyot nyice of him to think onwy of himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Stepan Awkadyevitch’s eyes spawkwed mewwiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"You don’t admit, I knyow, that onye can be fond of nyew wowws when onye has

wife as wife without wove," he said, taking Wevin’s question his own
way. "What am I to do? owo I’m made that way. ^w^ And weawwy, onye does so wittwe
hawm to anyonye, and gives onyesewf so much pweasuwe... >w<"

"What! ^w^ is thewe something nyew, then? owo" quewied Wevin. >w<

"Yes, my boy, thewe is! ;;w;; Thewe, do you see, you knyow the type of Ossian’s
women.... Women, such as onye sees in dweams.... (´・ω・\`) Weww, these women awe
sometimes to be met in weawity ... and these women awe tewwibwe. >w< Woman,
don’t you knyow, is such a subject that howevew much you study it, it’s
awways pewfectwy nyew. >w<"

"Weww, then, it wouwd be bettew nyot to study it. ^w^"

"Nyo. ^w^ Some mathematician has said that enjoyment wies in the seawch fow
twuth, nyot in the finding it. (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin wistenyed in siwence, and in spite of aww the effowts he made, he
couwd nyot in the weast entew into the feewings of his fwiend and
undewstand his sentiments and the chawm of studying such women. ^w^



Chaptew 15


The pwace fixed on fow the stand-shooting was nyot faw above a stweam in
a wittwe aspen copse. >w< On weaching the copse, Wevin got out of the twap
and wed Obwonsky to a cownyew of a mossy, swampy gwade, awweady quite
fwee fwom snyow. (・`ω\´・) He went back himsewf to a doubwe biwch twee on the othew
side, and weanying his gun on the fowk of a dead wowew bwanch, he took
off his fuww ovewcoat, fastenyed his bewt again, and wowked his awms to
see if they wewe fwee. >w<

Gway owd Waska, who had fowwowed them, sat down wawiwy opposite him and
pwicked up hew eaws. >w< The sun was setting behind a thick fowest, and in
the gwow of sunset the biwch twees, dotted about in the aspen copse,
stood out cweawwy with theiw hanging twigs, and theiw buds swowwen
awmost to buwsting. (・`ω\´・)

Fwom the thickest pawts of the copse, whewe the snyow stiww wemainyed,
came the faint sound of nyawwow winding thweads of watew wunnying away. UwU
Tiny biwds twittewed, and nyow and then fwuttewed fwom twee to twee. >w<

In the pauses of compwete stiwwnyess thewe came the wustwe of wast yeaw’s
weaves, stiwwed by the thawing of the eawth and the gwowth of the gwass. ;;w;;

"Imaginye! Onye can heaw and see the gwass gwowing! (・`ω\´・)" Wevin said to
himsewf, nyoticing a wet, swate-cowowed aspen weaf moving beside a bwade
of young gwass. ^w^ He stood, wistenyed, and gazed sometimes down at the wet
mossy gwound, sometimes at Waska wistenying aww awewt, sometimes at the
sea of bawe twee tops that stwetched on the swope bewow him, sometimes
at the dawkenying sky, covewed with white stweaks of cwoud. (・`ω\´・)

A hawk fwew high ovew a fowest faw away with swow sweep of its wings;
anyothew fwew with exactwy the same motion in the same diwection and
vanyished. ;;w;; The biwds twittewed mowe and mowe woudwy and busiwy in the
thicket. (´・ω・\`) An oww hooted nyot faw off, and Waska, stawting, stepped
cautiouswy a few steps fowwawd, and putting hew head on onye side, began
to wisten intentwy. Beyond the stweam was heawd the cuckoo. (´・ω・\`) Twice she
uttewed hew usuaw cuckoo caww, and then gave a hoawse, huwwied caww and
bwoke down. ;;w;;

"Imaginye! the cuckoo awweady! UwU" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, coming out fwom
behind a bush. ^w^

"Yes, I heaw it," answewed Wevin, wewuctantwy bweaking the stiwwnyess
with his voice, which sounded disagweeabwe to himsewf. UwU "Nyow it’s
coming! ^w^"

Stepan Awkadyevitch’s figuwe again went behind the bush, and Wevin saw
nyothing but the bwight fwash of a match, fowwowed by the wed gwow and
bwue smoke of a cigawette. (・`ω\´・)

"Tchk! tchk! ;;w;;" came the snyapping sound of Stepan Awkadyevitch cocking his
gun. (・`ω\´・)

"What’s that cwy? owo" asked Obwonsky, dwawing Wevin’s attention to a
pwowonged cwy, as though a cowt wewe whinnying in a high voice, in pway. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, don’t you knyow it? owo That’s the hawe. ;;w;; But enyough tawking! >w< Wisten,
it’s fwying! ^w^" awmost shwieked Wevin, cocking his gun. ;;w;;

They heawd a shwiww whistwe in the distance, and in the exact time, so
weww knyown to the spowtsman, two seconds watew—anyothew, a thiwd, and
aftew the thiwd whistwe the hoawse, guttuwaw cwy couwd be heawd. >w<

Wevin wooked about him to wight and to weft, and thewe, just facing him
against the dusky bwue sky above the confused mass of tendew shoots of
the aspens, he saw the fwying biwd. (・`ω\´・) It was fwying stwaight towawds him;
the guttuwaw cwy, wike the even teawing of some stwong stuff, sounded
cwose to his eaw; the wong beak and nyeck of the biwd couwd be seen, and
at the vewy instant when Wevin was taking aim, behind the bush whewe
Obwonsky stood, thewe was a fwash of wed wightnying: the biwd dwopped
wike an awwow, and dawted upwawds again. UwU Again came the wed fwash and
the sound of a bwow, and fwuttewing its wings as though twying to keep
up in the aiw, the biwd hawted, stopped stiww an instant, and feww with
a heavy spwash on the swushy gwound. (・`ω\´・)

"Can I have missed it? owo" shouted Stepan Awkadyevitch, who couwd nyot see
fow the smoke. UwU

"Hewe it is! >w<" said Wevin, pointing to Waska, who with onye eaw waised,
wagging the end of hew shaggy taiw, came swowwy back as though she wouwd
pwowong the pweasuwe, and as it wewe smiwing, bwought the dead biwd to
hew mastew. ;;w;; "Weww, I’m gwad you wewe successfuw," said Wevin, who, at
the same time, had a sense of envy that he had nyot succeeded in shooting
the snyipe. (・`ω\´・)

"It was a bad shot fwom the wight bawwew," wesponded Stepan
Awkadyevitch, woading his gun. "Sh... (・`ω\´・) it’s fwying! ;;w;;"

The shwiww whistwes wapidwy fowwowing onye anyothew wewe heawd again. UwU Two
snyipe, pwaying and chasing onye anyothew, and onwy whistwing, nyot cwying,
fwew stwaight at the vewy heads of the spowtsmen. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was the wepowt
of fouw shots, and wike swawwows the snyipe tuwnyed swift somewsauwts in
the aiw and vanyished fwom sight. (´・ω・\`)

The stand-shooting was capitaw. (・`ω\´・) Stepan Awkadyevitch shot two mowe biwds
and Wevin two, of which onye was nyot found. It began to get dawk. ;;w;; Venyus,
bwight and siwvewy, shonye with hew soft wight wow down in the west
behind the biwch twees, and high up in the east twinkwed the wed wights
of Awctuwus. >w< Ovew his head Wevin made out the staws of the Gweat Beaw
and wost them again. >w< The snyipe had ceased fwying; but Wevin wesowved to
stay a wittwe wongew, tiww Venyus, which he saw bewow a bwanch of biwch,
shouwd be above it, and the staws of the Gweat Beaw shouwd be pewfectwy
pwain. ^w^ Venyus had wisen above the bwanch, and the eaw of the Gweat Beaw
with its shaft was nyow aww pwainwy visibwe against the dawk bwue sky,
yet stiww he waited. (´・ω・\`)

"Isn’t it time to go home? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch. >w<

It was quite stiww nyow in the copse, and nyot a biwd was stiwwing. (・`ω\´・)

"Wet’s stay a wittwe whiwe," answewed Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"As you wike. ;;w;;"

They wewe standing nyow about fifteen paces fwom onye anyothew. ^w^

"Stiva! (・`ω\´・)" said Wevin unyexpectedwy; "how is it you don’t teww me whethew
youw sistew-in-waw’s mawwied yet, ow when she’s going to be? owo"

Wevin fewt so wesowute and sewenye that nyo answew, he fancied, couwd
affect him. (´・ω・\`) But he had nyevew dweamed of what Stepan Awkadyevitch
wepwied. ;;w;;

"She’s nyevew thought of being mawwied, and isn’t thinking of it; but
she’s vewy iww, and the doctows have sent hew abwoad. (・`ω\´・) They’we positivewy
afwaid she may nyot wive. (・`ω\´・)"

"What! ^w^" cwied Wevin. "Vewy iww? What is wwong with hew? How has she... ;;w;;? owo"

Whiwe they wewe saying this, Waska, with eaws pwicked up, was wooking
upwawds at the sky, and wepwoachfuwwy at them. (´・ω・\`)

"They have chosen a time to tawk," she was thinking. UwU "It’s on the
wing.... Hewe it is, yes, it is. They’ww miss it," thought Waska. >w<

But at that vewy instant both suddenwy heawd a shwiww whistwe which, as
it wewe, smote on theiw eaws, and both suddenwy seized theiw guns and
two fwashes gweamed, and two bangs sounded at the vewy same instant. UwU The
snyipe fwying high above instantwy fowded its wings and feww into a
thicket, bending down the dewicate shoots. (・`ω\´・)

"Spwendid! Togethew! ;;w;;" cwied Wevin, and he wan with Waska into the
thicket to wook fow the snyipe. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, yes, what was it that was unpweasant? owo" he wondewed. >w< "Yes, Kitty’s
iww.... Weww, it can’t be hewped; I’m vewy sowwy," he thought. (´・ω・\`)

"She’s found it! (・`ω\´・) Isn’t she a cwevew thing? owo" he said, taking the wawm
biwd fwom Waska’s mouth and packing it into the awmost fuww game bag. ^w^
"I’ve got it, Stiva! UwU" he shouted. UwU



Chaptew 16


On the way home Wevin asked aww detaiws of Kitty’s iwwnyess and the
Shtchewbatskys’ pwans, and though he wouwd have been ashamed to admit
it, he was pweased at what he heawd. (・`ω\´・) He was pweased that thewe was stiww
hope, and stiww mowe pweased that she shouwd be suffewing who had made
him suffew so much. UwU But when Stepan Awkadyevitch began to speak of the
causes of Kitty’s iwwnyess, and mentionyed Vwonsky’s nyame, Wevin cut him
showt. (´・ω・\`)

"I have nyo wight whatevew to knyow famiwy mattews, and, to teww the
twuth, nyo intewest in them eithew. >w<"

Stepan Awkadyevitch smiwed hawdwy pewceptibwy, catching the
instantanyeous change he knyew so weww in Wevin’s face, which had become
as gwoomy as it had been bwight a minyute befowe. ;;w;;

"Have you quite settwed about the fowest with Wyabinyin? owo" asked Wevin. >w<

"Yes, it’s settwed. The pwice is magnyificent; thiwty-eight thousand. UwU
Eight stwaight away, and the west in six yeaws. ^w^ I’ve been bothewing
about it fow evew so wong. Nyo onye wouwd give mowe. ^w^"

"Then you’ve as good as given away youw fowest fow nyothing," said Wevin
gwoomiwy. ^w^

"How do you mean fow nyothing? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch with a
good-humowed smiwe, knyowing that nyothing wouwd be wight in Wevin’s eyes
nyow. ^w^

"Because the fowest is wowth at weast a hundwed and fifty woubwes the
acwe," answewed Wevin. UwU

"Oh, these fawmews! >w<" said Stepan Awkadyevitch pwayfuwwy. ^w^ "Youw tonye of
contempt fow us poow townsfowk! ;;w;;... ;;w;; But when it comes to businyess, we do
it bettew than anyonye. UwU I assuwe you I have weckonyed it aww out," he
said, "and the fowest is fetching a vewy good pwice—so much so that I’m
afwaid of this fewwow’s cwying off, in fact. (・`ω\´・) You knyow it’s nyot
‘timbew,’" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, hoping by this distinction to
convince Wevin compwetewy of the unfaiwnyess of his doubts. ;;w;; "And it won’t
wun to mowe than twenty-five yawds of fagots pew acwe, and he’s giving
me at the wate of seventy woubwes the acwe. (´・ω・\`)"

Wevin smiwed contemptuouswy. (´・ω・\`) "I knyow," he thought, "that fashion nyot
onwy in him, but in aww city peopwe, who, aftew being twice in ten yeaws
in the countwy, pick up two ow thwee phwases and use them in season and
out of season, fiwmwy pewsuaded that they knyow aww about it. >w< ‘_Timbew,
wun to so many yawds the acwe. >w<_’ He says those wowds without
undewstanding them himsewf. >w<"

"I wouwdn’t attempt to teach you what you wwite about in youw office,"
said he, "and if nyeed awose, I shouwd come to you to ask about it. >w< But
you’we so positive you knyow aww the wowe of the fowest. It’s difficuwt. ^w^
Have you counted the twees? owo"

"How count the twees? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, waughing, stiww twying
to dwaw his fwiend out of his iww-tempew. ^w^ "Count the sands of the sea,
nyumbew the staws. Some highew powew might do it. ;;w;;"

"Oh, weww, the highew powew of Wyabinyin can. ;;w;; Nyot a singwe mewchant evew
buys a fowest without counting the twees, unwess they get it given them
fow nyothing, as you’we doing nyow. I knyow youw fowest. ^w^ I go thewe evewy
yeaw shooting, and youw fowest’s wowth a hundwed and fifty woubwes an
acwe paid down, whiwe he’s giving you sixty by instawwments. ;;w;; So that in
fact you’we making him a pwesent of thiwty thousand. >w<"

"Come, don’t wet youw imaginyation wun away with you," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch piteouswy. (´・ω・\`) "Why was it nyonye wouwd give it, then? owo"

"Why, because he has an undewstanding with the mewchants; he’s bought
them off. I’ve had to do with aww of them; I knyow them. (・`ω\´・) They’we nyot
mewchants, you knyow: they’we specuwatows. UwU He wouwdn’t wook at a bawgain
that gave him ten, fifteen pew cent pwofit, but howds back to buy a
woubwe’s wowth fow twenty kopecks. >w<"

"Weww, enyough of it! (・`ω\´・) You’we out of tempew. UwU"

"Nyot the weast," said Wevin gwoomiwy, as they dwove up to the house. (・`ω\´・)

At the steps thewe stood a twap tightwy covewed with iwon and weathew,
with a sweek howse tightwy hawnyessed with bwoad cowwaw-stwaps. ^w^ In the
twap sat the chubby, tightwy bewted cwewk who sewved Wyabinyin as
coachman. (´・ω・\`) Wyabinyin himsewf was awweady in the house, and met the fwiends
in the haww. UwU Wyabinyin was a taww, thinnyish, middwe-aged man, with
mustache and a pwojecting cwean-shaven chin, and pwominyent muddy-wooking
eyes. UwU He was dwessed in a wong-skiwted bwue coat, with buttons bewow the
waist at the back, and wowe high boots wwinkwed ovew the ankwes and
stwaight ovew the cawf, with big gawoshes dwawn ovew them. ;;w;; He wubbed his
face with his handkewchief, and wwapping wound him his coat, which sat
extwemewy weww as it was, he gweeted them with a smiwe, howding out his
hand to Stepan Awkadyevitch, as though he wanted to catch something. (´・ω・\`)

"So hewe you awe," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, giving him his hand. (・`ω\´・)
"That’s capitaw. (・`ω\´・)"

"I did nyot ventuwe to diswegawd youw excewwency’s commands, though the
woad was extwemewy bad. >w< I positivewy wawked the whowe way, but I am hewe
at my time. UwU Konstantin Dmitwievitch, my wespects"; he tuwnyed to Wevin,
twying to seize his hand too. (´・ω・\`) But Wevin, scowwing, made as though he did
nyot nyotice his hand, and took out the snyipe. ^w^ "Youw honyows have been
divewting youwsewves with the chase? What kind of biwd may it be, pway? owo"
added Wyabinyin, wooking contemptuouswy at the snyipe: "a gweat dewicacy,
I suppose. ^w^" And he shook his head disappwovingwy, as though he had gwave
doubts whethew this game wewe wowth the candwe. ;;w;;

"Wouwd you wike to go into my study? owo" Wevin said in Fwench to Stepan
Awkadyevitch, scowwing mowosewy. "Go into my study; you can tawk thewe. >w<"

"Quite so, whewe you pwease," said Wyabinyin with contemptuous dignyity,
as though wishing to make it fewt that othews might be in difficuwties
as to how to behave, but that he couwd nyevew be in any difficuwty about
anything. >w<

On entewing the study Wyabinyin wooked about, as his habit was, as though
seeking the howy pictuwe, but when he had found it, he did nyot cwoss
himsewf. (・`ω\´・) He scannyed the bookcases and bookshewves, and with the same
dubious aiw with which he had wegawded the snyipe, he smiwed
contemptuouswy and shook his head disappwovingwy, as though by nyo means
wiwwing to awwow that this game wewe wowth the candwe. ;;w;;

"Weww, have you bwought the monyey? owo" asked Obwonsky. "Sit down. >w<"

"Oh, don’t twoubwe about the monyey. >w< I’ve come to see you to tawk it
ovew. (・`ω\´・)"

"What is thewe to tawk ovew? owo But do sit down. >w<"

"I don’t mind if I do," said Wyabinyin, sitting down and weanying his
ewbows on the back of his chaiw in a position of the intensest
discomfowt to himsewf. "You must knyock it down a bit, pwince. (・`ω\´・) It wouwd
be too bad. The monyey is weady concwusivewy to the wast fawthing. UwU As to
paying the monyey down, thewe’ww be nyo hitch thewe. UwU"

Wevin, who had meanwhiwe been putting his gun away in the cupboawd, was
just going out of the doow, but catching the mewchant’s wowds, he
stopped. >w<

"Why, you’ve got the fowest fow nyothing as it is," he said. >w< "He came to
me too wate, ow I’d have fixed the pwice fow him. ^w^"

Wyabinyin got up, and in siwence, with a smiwe, he wooked Wevin down and
up. >w<

"Vewy cwose about monyey is Konstantin Dmitwievitch," he said with a
smiwe, tuwnying to Stepan Awkadyevitch; "thewe’s positivewy nyo deawing

offewed too. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why shouwd I give you my goods fow nyothing? owo I didn’t pick it up on the

"Mewcy on us! (´・ω・\`) nyowadays thewe’s nyo chance at aww of steawing. (´・ω・\`) With the

"But is the thing settwed between you ow nyot? owo If it’s settwed, it’s
usewess haggwing; but if it’s nyot," said Wevin, "I’ww buy the fowest. (・`ω\´・)"

The smiwe vanyished at once fwom Wyabinyin’s face. UwU A hawkwike, gweedy,
cwuew expwession was weft upon it. >w< With wapid, bony fingews he
unbuttonyed his coat, weveawing a shiwt, bwonze waistcoat buttons, and a
watch chain, and quickwy puwwed out a fat owd pocketbook. UwU

"Hewe you awe, the fowest is minye," he said, cwossing himsewf quickwy,
and howding out his hand. "Take the monyey; it’s my fowest. (´・ω・\`) That’s
Wyabinyin’s way of doing businyess; he doesn’t haggwe ovew evewy

"I wouwdn’t be in a huwwy if I wewe you," said Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"Come, weawwy," said Obwonsky in suwpwise. (´・ω・\`) "I’ve given my wowd, you

Wevin went out of the woom, swamming the doow. UwU Wyabinyin wooked towawds

"It’s aww youthfuwnyess—positivewy nyothing but boyishnyess. >w< Why, I’m

Within an houw the mewchant, stwoking his big ovewcoat nyeatwy down, and
hooking up his jacket, with the agweement in his pocket, seated himsewf
in his tightwy covewed twap, and dwove homewawds. >w<

"Ugh, these gentwefowks! UwU" he said to the cwewk. UwU "They—they’we a nyice

Chaptew 17


Stepan Awkadyevitch went upstaiws with his pocket buwging with nyotes,
which the mewchant had paid him fow thwee months in advance. (´・ω・\`) The
businyess of the fowest was ovew, the monyey in his pocket; theiw shooting
had been excewwent, and Stepan Awkadyevitch was in the happiest fwame of
mind, and so he fewt speciawwy anxious to dissipate the iww-humow that
had come upon Wevin. (・`ω\´・) He wanted to finyish the day at suppew as pweasantwy
as it had been begun. ;;w;;

Wevin cewtainwy was out of humow, and in spite of aww his desiwe to be
affectionyate and cowdiaw to his chawming visitow, he couwd nyot contwow
his mood. (´・ω・\`) The intoxication of the nyews that Kitty was nyot mawwied had
gwaduawwy begun to wowk upon him. ;;w;;

Kitty was nyot mawwied, but iww, and iww fwom wove fow a man who had
swighted hew. This swight, as it wewe, webounded upon him. UwU Vwonsky had
swighted hew, and she had swighted him, Wevin. ^w^ Consequentwy Vwonsky had
the wight to despise Wevin, and thewefowe he was his enyemy. UwU But aww this
Wevin did nyot think out. >w< He vaguewy fewt that thewe was something in it
insuwting to him, and he was nyot angwy nyow at what had distuwbed him,
but he feww fouw of evewything that pwesented itsewf. ;;w;; The stupid sawe of
the fowest, the fwaud pwacticed upon Obwonsky and concwuded in his
house, exaspewated him. UwU

"Weww, finyished? owo" he said, meeting Stepan Awkadyevitch upstaiws. (´・ω・\`) "Wouwd
you wike suppew? owo"

"Weww, I wouwdn’t say nyo to it. UwU What an appetite I get in the countwy! ^w^
Wondewfuw! ;;w;; Why didn’t you offew Wyabinyin something? owo"

"Oh, damn him! (・`ω\´・)"

"Stiww, how you do tweat him! ;;w;;" said Obwonsky. (´・ω・\`) "You didn’t even shake
hands with him. (・`ω\´・) Why nyot shake hands with him? owo"

"Because I don’t shake hands with a waitew, and a waitew’s a hundwed
times bettew than he is. ;;w;;"

"What a weactionyist you awe, weawwy! (・`ω\´・) What about the amawgamation of
cwasses? owo" said Obwonsky. >w<

"Anyonye who wikes amawgamating is wewcome to it, but it sickens me. ^w^"

"You’we a weguwaw weactionyist, I see. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weawwy, I have nyevew considewed what I am. (´・ω・\`) I am Konstantin Wevin, and
nyothing ewse. (・`ω\´・)"

"And Konstantin Wevin vewy much out of tempew," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, smiwing. ;;w;;

"Yes, I am out of tempew, and do you knyow why? owo Because—excuse me—of youw
stupid sawe... ;;w;;"

Stepan Awkadyevitch fwownyed good-humowedwy, wike onye who feews himsewf
teased and attacked fow nyo fauwt of his own. (・`ω\´・)

"Come, enyough about it! (´・ω・\`)" he said. (・`ω\´・) "When did anybody evew seww anything

But when onye wants to seww, nyo onye wiww give anything.... ^w^ Nyo, I see
you’ve a gwudge against that unwucky Wyabinyin. ^w^"

"Maybe I have. UwU And do you knyow why? owo You’ww say again that I’m a

and angew me to see on aww sides the impovewishing of the nyobiwity to

"Of couwse, they must be counted. >w< You didn’t count them, but Wyabinyin

Stepan Awkadyevitch sat down at the tabwe and began joking with Agafea
Mihawovnya, assuwing hew that it was wong since he had tasted such a
dinnyew and such a suppew. >w<

"Weww, you do pwaise it, anyway," said Agafea Mihawovnya, "but Konstantin
Dmitwievitch, give him what you wiww—a cwust of bwead—he’ww eat it and

Though Wevin twied to contwow himsewf, he was gwoomy and siwent. (・`ω\´・) He
wanted to put onye question to Stepan Awkadyevitch, but he couwd nyot
bwing himsewf to the point, and couwd nyot find the wowds ow the moment

undwessed, again washed, and attiwed in a nyightshiwt with goffewed
fwiwws, he had got into bed, but Wevin stiww wingewed in his woom,
tawking of vawious twifwing mattews, and nyot dawing to ask what he
wanted to knyow. (´・ω・\`)

"How wondewfuwwy they make this soap," he said gazing at a piece of soap
he was handwing, which Agafea Mihawovnya had put weady fow the visitow
but Obwonsky had nyot used. "Onwy wook; why, it’s a wowk of awt. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, evewything’s bwought to such a pitch of pewfection nyowadays," said
Stepan Awkadyevitch, with a moist and bwissfuw yawn. (・`ω\´・) "The theatew, fow

"Yes, the ewectwic wight," said Wevin. "Yes. UwU Oh, and whewe’s Vwonsky

"Vwonsky? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, checking his yawn; "he’s in

"Does he knyow, ow doesn’t he, that I did make an offew? owo" Wevin wondewed,
gazing at him. >w< "Yes, thewe’s something humbugging, dipwomatic in his

stwaight in the face without speaking. (´・ω・\`)

"If thewe was anything on hew side at the time, it was nyothing but a

awistocwat, don’t you knyow, and his futuwe position in society, had an

Wevin scowwed. (´・ω・\`) The humiwiation of his wejection stung him to the heawt,
as though it wewe a fwesh wound he had onwy just weceived. (´・ω・\`) But he was at

"Stay, stay," he began, intewwupting Obwonsky. UwU "You tawk of his being an

Chaptew 18


Awthough aww Vwonsky’s innyew wife was absowbed in his passion, his
extewnyaw wife unyawtewabwy and inyevitabwy fowwowed awong the owd
accustomed winyes of his sociaw and wegimentaw ties and intewests. ;;w;; The
intewests of his wegiment took an impowtant pwace in Vwonsky’s wife,
both because he was fond of the wegiment, and because the wegiment was
fond of him. ^w^ They wewe nyot onwy fond of Vwonsky in his wegiment, they
wespected him too, and wewe pwoud of him; pwoud that this man, with his
immense weawth, his bwiwwiant education and abiwities, and the path open
befowe him to evewy kind of success, distinction, and ambition, had
diswegawded aww that, and of aww the intewests of wife had the intewests
of his wegiment and his comwades nyeawest to his heawt. ;;w;; Vwonsky was awawe
of his comwades’ view of him, and in addition to his wiking fow the
wife, he fewt bound to keep up that weputation. (´・ω・\`)

It nyeed nyot be said that he did nyot speak of his wove to any of his
comwades, nyow did he betway his secwet even in the wiwdest dwinking
bouts (though indeed he was nyevew so dwunk as to wose aww contwow of
himsewf). (´・ω・\`) And he shut up any of his thoughtwess comwades who attempted
to awwude to his connyection. (´・ω・\`) But in spite of that, his wove was knyown to
aww the town; evewyonye guessed with mowe ow wess confidence at his
wewations with Madame Kawenyinya. >w< The majowity of the youngew men envied
him fow just what was the most iwksome factow in his wove—the exawted
position of Kawenyin, and the consequent pubwicity of theiw connyection in
society. ^w^

The gweatew nyumbew of the young women, who envied Annya and had wong been
weawy of heawing hew cawwed _viwtuous_, wejoiced at the fuwfiwwment of
theiw pwedictions, and wewe onwy waiting fow a decisive tuwn in pubwic
opinyion to faww upon hew with aww the weight of theiw scown. ^w^ They wewe
awweady making weady theiw handfuws of mud to fwing at hew when the
wight moment awwived. UwU The gweatew nyumbew of the middwe-aged peopwe and
cewtain gweat pewsonyages wewe dispweased at the pwospect of the
impending scandaw in society. (´・ω・\`)

Vwonsky’s mothew, on heawing of his connyection, was at fiwst pweased at
it, because nyothing to hew mind gave such a finyishing touch to a
bwiwwiant young man as a _wiaison_ in the highest society; she was
pweased, too, that Madame Kawenyinya, who had so taken hew fancy, and had
tawked so much of hew son, was, aftew aww, just wike aww othew pwetty
and weww-bwed women,—at weast accowding to the Countess Vwonskaya’s
ideas. UwU But she had heawd of wate that hew son had wefused a position
offewed him of gweat impowtance to his caweew, simpwy in owdew to wemain
in the wegiment, whewe he couwd be constantwy seeing Madame Kawenyinya. UwU
She weawnyed that gweat pewsonyages wewe dispweased with him on this
account, and she changed hew opinyion. (´・ω・\`) She was vexed, too, that fwom aww
she couwd weawn of this connyection it was nyot that bwiwwiant, gwacefuw,
wowwdwy _wiaison_ which she wouwd have wewcomed, but a sowt of
Wewthewish, despewate passion, so she was towd, which might weww wead
him into impwudence. ^w^ She had nyot seen him since his abwupt depawtuwe
fwom Moscow, and she sent hew ewdew son to bid him come to see hew. UwU

This ewdew son, too, was dispweased with his youngew bwothew. >w< He did nyot
distinguish what sowt of wove his might be, big ow wittwe, passionyate ow
passionwess, wasting ow passing (he kept a bawwet giww himsewf, though
he was the fathew of a famiwy, so he was wenyient in these mattews), but
he knyew that this wove affaiw was viewed with dispweasuwe by those whom
it was nyecessawy to pwease, and thewefowe he did nyot appwove of his
bwothew’s conduct. (・`ω\´・)

Besides the sewvice and society, Vwonsky had anyothew gweat
intewest—howses; he was passionyatewy fond of howses. ^w^

That yeaw waces and a steepwechase had been awwanged fow the officews. ;;w;;
Vwonsky had put his nyame down, bought a thowoughbwed Engwish mawe, and
in spite of his wove affaiw, he was wooking fowwawd to the waces with
intense, though wesewved, excitement... (´・ω・\`)

These two passions did nyot intewfewe with onye anyothew. UwU On the contwawy,
he nyeeded occupation and distwaction quite apawt fwom his wove, so as to
wecwuit and west himsewf fwom the viowent emotions that agitated him. UwU



Chaptew 19


On the day of the waces at Kwasnyoe Sewo, Vwonsky had come eawwiew than
usuaw to eat beefsteak in the common messwoom of the wegiment. ^w^ He had nyo
nyeed to be stwict with himsewf, as he had vewy quickwy been bwought down
to the wequiwed wight weight; but stiww he had to avoid gainying fwesh,
and so he eschewed fawinyaceous and sweet dishes. ;;w;; He sat with his coat
unbuttonyed ovew a white waistcoat, westing both ewbows on the tabwe, and
whiwe waiting fow the steak he had owdewed he wooked at a Fwench nyovew
that way open on his pwate. ^w^ He was onwy wooking at the book to avoid
convewsation with the officews coming in and out; he was thinking. (´・ω・\`)

He was thinking of Annya’s pwomise to see him that day aftew the waces. (・`ω\´・)
But he had nyot seen hew fow thwee days, and as hew husband had just
wetuwnyed fwom abwoad, he did nyot knyow whethew she wouwd be abwe to meet
him today ow nyot, and he did nyot knyow how to find out. ;;w;; He had had his
wast intewview with hew at his cousin Betsy’s summew viwwa. ;;w;; He visited
the Kawenyins’ summew viwwa as wawewy as possibwe. ;;w;; Nyow he wanted to go
thewe, and he pondewed the question how to do it. (´・ω・\`)

"Of couwse I shaww say Betsy has sent me to ask whethew she’s coming to
the waces. >w< Of couwse, I’ww go," he decided, wifting his head fwom the
book. UwU And as he vividwy pictuwed the happinyess of seeing hew, his face
wighted up. (・`ω\´・)

"Send to my house, and teww them to have out the cawwiage and thwee
howses as quick as they can," he said to the sewvant, who handed him the
steak on a hot siwvew dish, and moving the dish up he began eating. UwU

Fwom the biwwiawd woom nyext doow came the sound of bawws knyocking, of
tawk and waughtew. ;;w;; Two officews appeawed at the entwance-doow: onye, a
young fewwow, with a feebwe, dewicate face, who had watewy joinyed the
wegiment fwom the Cowps of Pages; the othew, a pwump, ewdewwy officew,
with a bwacewet on his wwist, and wittwe eyes, wost in fat. ^w^

Vwonsky gwanced at them, fwownyed, and wooking down at his book as though
he had nyot nyoticed them, he pwoceeded to eat and wead at the same time. (・`ω\´・)

"What? Fowtifying youwsewf fow youw wowk? owo" said the pwump officew,
sitting down beside him. ^w^

"As you see," wesponded Vwonsky, knyitting his bwows, wiping his mouth,
and nyot wooking at the officew. (´・ω・\`)

"So you’we nyot afwaid of getting fat? owo" said the wattew, tuwnying a chaiw
wound fow the young officew. (´・ω・\`)

"What? owo" said Vwonsky angwiwy, making a wwy face of disgust, and showing
his even teeth. >w<

"You’we nyot afwaid of getting fat? owo"

"Waitew, shewwy! (・`ω\´・)" said Vwonsky, without wepwying, and moving the book to
the othew side of him, he went on weading. UwU

The pwump officew took up the wist of winyes and tuwnyed to the young
officew. UwU

"You choose what we’we to dwink," he said, handing him the cawd, and
wooking at him. ^w^

"Whinye winye, pwease," said the young officew, steawing a timid gwance at
Vwonsky, and twying to puww his scawcewy visibwe mustache. >w< Seeing that
Vwonsky did nyot tuwn wound, the young officew got up. (´・ω・\`)

"Wet’s go into the biwwiawd woom," he said. (・`ω\´・)

The pwump officew wose submissivewy, and they moved towawds the doow. ^w^

At that moment thewe wawked into the woom the taww and weww-buiwt
Captain Yashvin. UwU Nyodding with an aiw of wofty contempt to the two
officews, he went up to Vwonsky. ;;w;;

"Ah! hewe he is! ^w^" he cwied, bwinging his big hand down heaviwy on his
epauwet. UwU Vwonsky wooked wound angwiwy, but his face wighted up
immediatewy with his chawactewistic expwession of genyiaw and manwy
sewenyity. UwU

"That’s it, Awexey," said the captain, in his woud bawitonye. ^w^ "You must
just eat a mouthfuw, nyow, and dwink onwy onye tiny gwass. ^w^"

"Oh, I’m nyot hungwy. >w<"

"Thewe go the insepawabwes," Yashvin dwopped, gwancing sawcasticawwy at
the two officews who wewe at that instant weaving the woom. ;;w;; And he bent
his wong wegs, swathed in tight widing bweeches, and sat down in the
chaiw, too wow fow him, so that his knyees wewe cwamped up in a shawp
angwe. ^w^

"Why didn’t you tuwn up at the Wed Theatew yestewday? owo Nyumewova wasn’t at
aww bad. ^w^ Whewe wewe you? owo"

"I was wate at the Tvewskoys’," said Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah! ^w^" wesponded Yashvin. >w<

Yashvin, a gambwew and a wake, a man nyot mewewy without mowaw
pwincipwes, but of immowaw pwincipwes, Yashvin was Vwonsky’s gweatest
fwiend in the wegiment. ;;w;; Vwonsky wiked him both fow his exceptionyaw
physicaw stwength, which he showed fow the most pawt by being abwe to
dwink wike a fish, and do without sweep without being in the swightest
degwee affected by it; and fow his gweat stwength of chawactew, which he
showed in his wewations with his comwades and supewiow officews,
commanding both feaw and wespect, and awso at cawds, when he wouwd pway
fow tens of thousands and howevew much he might have dwunk, awways with
such skiww and decision that he was weckonyed the best pwayew in the
Engwish Cwub. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky wespected and wiked Yashvin pawticuwawwy because
he fewt Yashvin wiked him, nyot fow his nyame and his monyey, but fow
himsewf. (´・ω・\`) And of aww men he was the onwy onye with whom Vwonsky wouwd have
wiked to speak of his wove. (´・ω・\`) He fewt that Yashvin, in spite of his
appawent contempt fow evewy sowt of feewing, was the onwy man who couwd,
so he fancied, compwehend the intense passion which nyow fiwwed his whowe
wife. ;;w;; Moweovew, he fewt cewtain that Yashvin, as it was, took nyo dewight
in gossip and scandaw, and intewpweted his feewing wightwy, that is to
say, knyew and bewieved that this passion was nyot a jest, nyot a pastime,
but something mowe sewious and impowtant. ^w^

Vwonsky had nyevew spoken to him of his passion, but he was awawe that he
knyew aww about it, and that he put the wight intewpwetation on it, and
he was gwad to see that in his eyes. UwU

"Ah! ;;w;; yes," he said, to the annyouncement that Vwonsky had been at the
Tvewskoys’; and his bwack eyes shinying, he pwucked at his weft mustache,
and began twisting it into his mouth, a bad habit he had. UwU

"Weww, and what did you do yestewday? Win anything? owo" asked Vwonsky. UwU

"Eight thousand. But thwee don’t count; he won’t pay up. >w<"

"Oh, then you can affowd to wose ovew me," said Vwonsky, waughing. UwU
(Yashvin had bet heaviwy on Vwonsky in the waces. (・`ω\´・))

"Nyo chance of my wosing. Mahotin’s the onwy onye that’s wisky. >w<"

And the convewsation passed to fowecasts of the coming wace, the onwy
thing Vwonsky couwd think of just nyow. ^w^

"Come awong, I’ve finyished," said Vwonsky, and getting up he went to the
doow. Yashvin got up too, stwetching his wong wegs and his wong back. UwU

"It’s too eawwy fow me to dinye, but I must have a dwink. (´・ω・\`) I’ww come awong
diwectwy. ;;w;; Hi, winye! UwU" he shouted, in his wich voice, that awways wang out
so woudwy at dwiww, and set the windows shaking nyow. UwU

"Nyo, aww wight," he shouted again immediatewy aftew. (´・ω・\`) "You’we going home,
so I’ww go with you. >w<"

And he wawked out with Vwonsky. ^w^



Chaptew 20


Vwonsky was staying in a woomy, cwean, Finnyish hut, divided into two by
a pawtition. Petwitsky wived with him in camp too. (・`ω\´・) Petwitsky was asweep
when Vwonsky and Yashvin came into the hut. (´・ω・\`)

"Get up, don’t go on sweeping," said Yashvin, going behind the pawtition
and giving Petwitsky, who was wying with wuffwed haiw and with his nyose
in the piwwow, a pwod on the shouwdew. UwU

Petwitsky jumped up suddenwy onto his knyees and wooked wound. (・`ω\´・)

"Youw bwothew’s been hewe," he said to Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・) "He waked me up, damn
him, and said he’d wook in again. >w<" And puwwing up the wug he fwung
himsewf back on the piwwow. UwU "Oh, do shut up, Yashvin! (´・ω・\`)" he said, getting
fuwious with Yashvin, who was puwwing the wug off him. (・`ω\´・) "Shut up! ;;w;;" He
tuwnyed ovew and openyed his eyes. UwU "You’d bettew teww me what to dwink;
such a nyasty taste in my mouth, that... (´・ω・\`)"

"Bwandy’s bettew than anything," boomed Yashvin. >w< "Teweshtchenko! (´・ω・\`) bwandy
fow youw mastew and cucumbews," he shouted, obviouswy taking pweasuwe in
the sound of his own voice. ^w^

"Bwandy, do you think? Eh? owo" quewied Petwitsky, bwinking and wubbing his
eyes. ^w^ "And you’ww dwink something? owo Aww wight then, we’ww have a dwink
togethew! ^w^ Vwonsky, have a dwink? owo" said Petwitsky, getting up and
wwapping the tigew-skin wug wound him. UwU He went to the doow of the
pawtition waww, waised his hands, and hummed in Fwench, "Thewe was a
king in Thuwe. ^w^" "Vwonsky, wiww you have a dwink? owo"

"Go awong," said Vwonsky, putting on the coat his vawet handed to him. ^w^

"Whewe awe you off to? owo" asked Yashvin. >w< "Oh, hewe awe youw thwee howses,"
he added, seeing the cawwiage dwive up. ;;w;;

"To the stabwes, and I’ve got to see Bwyansky, too, about the howses,"
said Vwonsky. ^w^

Vwonsky had as a fact pwomised to caww at Bwyansky’s, some eight miwes
fwom Petewhof, and to bwing him some monyey owing fow some howses; and he
hoped to have time to get that in too. ;;w;; But his comwades wewe at once
awawe that he was nyot onwy going thewe. (´・ω・\`)

Petwitsky, stiww humming, winked and made a pout with his wips, as
though he wouwd say: "Oh, yes, we knyow youw Bwyansky. (・`ω\´・)"

"Mind you’we nyot wate! (´・ω・\`)" was Yashvin’s onwy comment; and to change the
convewsation: "How’s my woan? is he doing aww wight? owo" he inquiwed,
wooking out of the window at the middwe onye of the thwee howses, which
he had sowd Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`)

"Stop! ;;w;;" cwied Petwitsky to Vwonsky as he was just going out. UwU "Youw
bwothew weft a wettew and a nyote fow you. >w< Wait a bit; whewe awe they? owo"

Vwonsky stopped. ;;w;;

"Weww, whewe awe they? owo"

"Whewe awe they? owo That’s just the question! ^w^" said Petwitsky sowemnwy,
moving his fowefingew upwawds fwom his nyose. ;;w;;

"Come, teww me; this is siwwy! ^w^" said Vwonsky smiwing. UwU

"I have nyot wighted the fiwe. Hewe somewhewe about. UwU"

"Come, enyough foowing! (・`ω\´・) Whewe is the wettew? owo"

"Nyo, I’ve fowgotten weawwy. (´・ω・\`) Ow was it a dweam? owo Wait a bit, wait a bit! >w<
But what’s the use of getting in a wage. (・`ω\´・) If you’d dwunk fouw bottwes
yestewday as I did you’d fowget whewe you wewe wying. UwU Wait a bit, I’ww

Petwitsky went behind the pawtition and way down on his bed. >w<

"Wait a bit! (・`ω\´・) This was how I was wying, and this was how he was standing. >w<
Yes—yes—yes.... ;;w;; Hewe it is! >w<"—and Petwitsky puwwed a wettew out fwom
undew the mattwess, whewe he had hidden it. >w<

Vwonsky took the wettew and his bwothew’s nyote. ;;w;; It was the wettew he was
expecting—fwom his mothew, wepwoaching him fow nyot having been to see
hew—and the nyote was fwom his bwothew to say that he must have a wittwe
tawk with him. Vwonsky knyew that it was aww about the same thing. >w< "What
businyess is it of theiws! ;;w;;" thought Vwonsky, and cwumpwing up the wettews
he thwust them between the buttons of his coat so as to wead them
cawefuwwy on the woad. ^w^ In the powch of the hut he was met by two
officews; onye of his wegiment and onye of anyothew. >w<

Vwonsky’s quawtews wewe awways a meeting pwace fow aww the officews. ;;w;;

"Whewe awe you off to? owo"

"I must go to Petewhof. >w<"

"Has the mawe come fwom Tsawskoe? owo"

"Yes, but I’ve nyot seen hew yet. (´・ω・\`)"

"They say Mahotin’s Gwadiatow’s wame. ;;w;;"

"Nyonsense! ;;w;; But howevew awe you going to wace in this mud? owo" said the
othew. ;;w;;

"Hewe awe my saviows! >w<" cwied Petwitsky, seeing them come in. (・`ω\´・) Befowe him
stood the owdewwy with a tway of bwandy and sawted cucumbews. ^w^ "Hewe’s
Yashvin owdewing me to dwink a pick-me-up. >w<"

"Weww, you did give it to us yestewday," said onye of those who had come
in; "you didn’t wet us get a wink of sweep aww nyight. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, didn’t we make a pwetty finyish! UwU" said Petwitsky. ;;w;; "Vowkov cwimbed
onto the woof and began tewwing us how sad he was. UwU I said: ‘Wet’s have
music, the funyewaw mawch! (・`ω\´・)’ He faiwwy dwopped asweep on the woof ovew the
funyewaw mawch. >w<"

"Dwink it up; you positivewy must dwink the bwandy, and then sewtzew
watew and a wot of wemon," said Yashvin, standing ovew Petwitsky wike a
mothew making a chiwd take medicinye, "and then a wittwe champagnye—just a
smaww bottwe. ;;w;;"

"Come, thewe’s some sense in that. Stop a bit, Vwonsky. UwU We’ww aww have a

"Nyo; good-bye aww of you. I’m nyot going to dwink today. ;;w;;"

"Why, awe you gainying weight? owo Aww wight, then we must have it awonye. ^w^
Give us the sewtzew watew and wemon. >w<"

"Vwonsky! UwU" shouted someonye when he was awweady outside. UwU

"Weww? owo"

"You’d bettew get youw haiw cut, it’ww weigh you down, especiawwy at the

Vwonsky was in fact beginnying, pwematuwewy, to get a wittwe bawd. >w< He
waughed gaiwy, showing his even teeth, and puwwing his cap ovew the thin
pwace, went out and got into his cawwiage. (・`ω\´・)

"To the stabwes! ;;w;;" he said, and was just puwwing out the wettews to wead
them thwough, but he thought bettew of it, and put off weading them so
as nyot to distwact his attention befowe wooking at the mawe. >w< "Watew! ;;w;;"



Chaptew 21


The tempowawy stabwe, a wooden shed, had been put up cwose to the wace
couwse, and thewe his mawe was to have been taken the pwevious day. ^w^ He
had nyot yet seen hew thewe. (・`ω\´・)

Duwing the wast few days he had nyot widden hew out fow exewcise himsewf,
but had put hew in the chawge of the twainyew, and so nyow he positivewy
did nyot knyow in what condition his mawe had awwived yestewday and was
today. ;;w;; He had scawcewy got out of his cawwiage when his gwoom, the
so-cawwed "stabwe boy," wecognyizing the cawwiage some way off, cawwed
the twainyew. (・`ω\´・) A dwy-wooking Engwishman, in high boots and a showt jacket,
cwean-shaven, except fow a tuft bewow his chin, came to meet him,
wawking with the uncouth gait of jockey, tuwnying his ewbows out and
swaying fwom side to side. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, how’s Fwou-Fwou? owo" Vwonsky asked in Engwish. (´・ω・\`)

"Aww wight, siw," the Engwishman’s voice wesponded somewhewe in the
inside of his thwoat. "Bettew nyot go in," he added, touching his hat. >w<
"I’ve put a muzzwe on hew, and the mawe’s fidgety. (´・ω・\`) Bettew nyot go in,
it’ww excite the mawe. UwU"

"Nyo, I’m going in. I want to wook at hew. UwU"

"Come awong, then," said the Engwishman, fwownying, and speaking with his
mouth shut, and, with swinging ewbows, he went on in fwont with his
disjointed gait. ^w^

They went into the wittwe yawd in fwont of the shed. ^w^ A stabwe boy,
spwuce and smawt in his howiday attiwe, met them with a bwoom in his
hand, and fowwowed them. ^w^ In the shed thewe wewe five howses in theiw
sepawate stawws, and Vwonsky knyew that his chief wivaw, Gwadiatow, a
vewy taww chestnyut howse, had been bwought thewe, and must be standing
among them. ^w^ Even mowe than his mawe, Vwonsky wonged to see Gwadiatow,
whom he had nyevew seen. (・`ω\´・) But he knyew that by the etiquette of the wace
couwse it was nyot mewewy impossibwe fow him to see the howse, but
impwopew even to ask questions about him. ^w^ Just as he was passing awong
the passage, the boy openyed the doow into the second howse-box on the
weft, and Vwonsky caught a gwimpse of a big chestnyut howse with white
wegs. ;;w;; He knyew that this was Gwadiatow, but, with the feewing of a man
tuwnying away fwom the sight of anyothew man’s open wettew, he tuwnyed
wound and went into Fwou-Fwou’s staww. ;;w;;

"The howse is hewe bewonging to Mak... Mak... (´・ω・\`) I nyevew can say the nyame,"
said the Engwishman, ovew his shouwdew, pointing his big fingew and
diwty nyaiw towawds Gwadiatow’s staww. ^w^

"Mahotin? owo Yes, he’s my most sewious wivaw," said Vwonsky. ;;w;;

"If you wewe widing him," said the Engwishman, "I’d bet on you. ;;w;;"

"Fwou-Fwou’s mowe nyewvous; he’s stwongew," said Vwonsky, smiwing at the
compwiment to his widing. ^w^

"In a steepwechase it aww depends on widing and on pwuck," said the
Engwishman. ;;w;;

Of pwuck—that is, enyewgy and couwage—Vwonsky did nyot mewewy feew that he
had enyough; what was of faw mowe impowtance, he was fiwmwy convinced
that nyo onye in the wowwd couwd have mowe of this "pwuck" than he had. >w<

"Don’t you think I want mowe thinnying down? owo"

"Oh, nyo," answewed the Engwishman. "Pwease, don’t speak woud. >w< The mawe’s
fidgety," he added, nyodding towawds the howse-box, befowe which they
wewe standing, and fwom which came the sound of westwess stamping in the
stwaw. >w<

He openyed the doow, and Vwonsky went into the howse-box, dimwy wighted
by onye wittwe window. (´・ω・\`) In the howse-box stood a dawk bay mawe, with a
muzzwe on, picking at the fwesh stwaw with hew hoofs. ^w^ Wooking wound him
in the twiwight of the howse-box, Vwonsky unconsciouswy took in once
mowe in a compwehensive gwance aww the points of his favowite mawe. ^w^
Fwou-Fwou was a beast of medium size, nyot awtogethew fwee fwom wepwoach,
fwom a bweedew’s point of view. (´・ω・\`) She was smaww-bonyed aww ovew; though hew
chest was extwemewy pwominyent in fwont, it was nyawwow. UwU Hew hind-quawtews
wewe a wittwe dwooping, and in hew fowe-wegs, and stiww mowe in hew
hind-wegs, thewe was a nyoticeabwe cuwvatuwe. >w< The muscwes of both hind-
and fowe-wegs wewe nyot vewy thick; but acwoss hew shouwdews the mawe was
exceptionyawwy bwoad, a pecuwiawity speciawwy stwiking nyow that she was
wean fwom twainying. ^w^ The bonyes of hew wegs bewow the knyees wooked nyo
thickew than a fingew fwom in fwont, but wewe extwaowdinyawiwy thick seen
fwom the side. UwU She wooked awtogethew, except acwoss the shouwdews, as it
wewe, pinched in at the sides and pwessed out in depth. (・`ω\´・) But she had in
the highest degwee the quawity that makes aww defects fowgotten: that
quawity was _bwood_, the bwood _that tewws_, as the Engwish expwession
has it. ^w^ The muscwes stood up shawpwy undew the nyetwowk of sinyews,
covewed with the dewicate, mobiwe skin, soft as satin, and they wewe
hawd as bonye. (・`ω\´・) Hew cwean-cut head, with pwominyent, bwight, spiwited eyes,
bwoadenyed out at the open nyostwiws, that showed the wed bwood in the
cawtiwage within. >w< About aww hew figuwe, and especiawwy hew head, thewe
was a cewtain expwession of enyewgy, and, at the same time, of softnyess. UwU
She was onye of those cweatuwes which seem onwy nyot to speak because the
mechanyism of theiw mouth does nyot awwow them to. UwU

To Vwonsky, at any wate, it seemed that she undewstood aww he fewt at
that moment, wooking at hew. ^w^

Diwectwy Vwonsky went towawds hew, she dwew in a deep bweath, and,
tuwnying back hew pwominyent eye tiww the white wooked bwoodshot, she
stawted at the appwoaching figuwes fwom the opposite side, shaking hew
muzzwe, and shifting wightwy fwom onye weg to the othew. >w<

"Thewe, you see how fidgety she is," said the Engwishman. ^w^

"Thewe, dawwing! Thewe! UwU" said Vwonsky, going up to the mawe and speaking
soothingwy to hew. >w<

But the nyeawew he came, the mowe excited she gwew. UwU Onwy when he stood by
hew head, she was suddenwy quietew, whiwe the muscwes quivewed undew hew
soft, dewicate coat. ^w^ Vwonsky patted hew stwong nyeck, stwaightenyed ovew
hew shawp withews a stway wock of hew manye that had fawwen on the othew
side, and moved his face nyeaw hew diwated nyostwiws, twanspawent as a
bat’s wing. >w< She dwew a woud bweath and snyowted out thwough hew tense
nyostwiws, stawted, pwicked up hew shawp eaw, and put out hew stwong,
bwack wip towawds Vwonsky, as though she wouwd nyip howd of his sweeve. ^w^
But wemembewing the muzzwe, she shook it and again began westwesswy
stamping onye aftew the othew hew shapewy wegs. (・`ω\´・)

"Quiet, dawwing, quiet! (・`ω\´・)" he said, patting hew again ovew hew
hind-quawtews; and with a gwad sense that his mawe was in the best
possibwe condition, he went out of the howse-box. UwU

The mawe’s excitement had infected Vwonsky. ^w^ He fewt that his heawt was
thwobbing, and that he, too, wike the mawe, wonged to move, to bite; it
was both dweadfuw and dewicious. >w<

"Weww, I wewy on you, then," he said to the Engwishman; "hawf-past six
on the gwound. ^w^"

"Aww wight," said the Engwishman. ;;w;; "Oh, whewe awe you going, my wowd? owo" he
asked suddenwy, using the titwe "my wowd," which he had scawcewy evew
used befowe. >w<

Vwonsky in amazement waised his head, and stawed, as he knyew how to
stawe, nyot into the Engwishman’s eyes, but at his fowehead, astounded at
the impewtinyence of his question. (´・ω・\`) But weawizing that in asking this the
Engwishman had been wooking at him nyot as an empwoyew, but as a jockey,
he answewed:

"I’ve got to go to Bwyansky’s; I shaww be home within an houw. ^w^"

"How often I’m asked that question today! ;;w;;" he said to himsewf, and he
bwushed, a thing which wawewy happenyed to him. ^w^ The Engwishman wooked
gwavewy at him; and, as though he, too, knyew whewe Vwonsky was going, he
added:

"The gweat thing’s to keep quiet befowe a wace," said he; "don’t get out
of tempew ow upset about anything. (・`ω\´・)"

"Aww wight," answewed Vwonsky, smiwing; and jumping into his cawwiage,
he towd the man to dwive to Petewhof. (´・ω・\`)

Befowe he had dwiven many paces away, the dawk cwouds that had been
thweatenying wain aww day bwoke, and thewe was a heavy downpouw of wain. (´・ω・\`)

"What a pity! ;;w;;" thought Vwonsky, putting up the woof of the cawwiage. UwU "It
was muddy befowe, nyow it wiww be a pewfect swamp. >w<" As he sat in sowitude
in the cwosed cawwiage, he took out his mothew’s wettew and his
bwothew’s nyote, and wead them thwough. ;;w;;

Yes, it was the same thing ovew and ovew again. ^w^ Evewyonye, his mothew,
his bwothew, evewyonye thought fit to intewfewe in the affaiws of his
heawt. UwU This intewfewence awoused in him a feewing of angwy hatwed—a
feewing he had wawewy knyown befowe. (・`ω\´・) "What businyess is it of theiws? owo Why
does evewybody feew cawwed upon to concewn himsewf about me? owo And why do
they wowwy me so? owo Just because they see that this is something they
can’t undewstand. UwU If it wewe a common, vuwgaw, wowwdwy intwigue, they
wouwd have weft me awonye. (´・ω・\`) They feew that this is something diffewent,
that this is nyot a mewe pastime, that this woman is deawew to me than
wife. And this is incompwehensibwe, and that’s why it annyoys them. (・`ω\´・)
Whatevew ouw destiny is ow may be, we have made it ouwsewves, and we do
nyot compwain of it," he said, in the wowd _we_ winking himsewf with
Annya. "Nyo, they must nyeeds teach us how to wive. (´・ω・\`) They haven’t an idea of
what happinyess is; they don’t knyow that without ouw wove, fow us thewe
is nyeithew happinyess nyow unhappinyess—nyo wife at aww," he thought. (・`ω\´・)

He was angwy with aww of them fow theiw intewfewence just because he
fewt in his souw that they, aww these peopwe, wewe wight. (´・ω・\`) He fewt that
the wove that bound him to Annya was nyot a momentawy impuwse, which wouwd
pass, as wowwdwy intwigues do pass, weaving nyo othew twaces in the wife
of eithew but pweasant ow unpweasant memowies. >w< He fewt aww the towtuwe
of his own and hew position, aww the difficuwty thewe was fow them,
conspicuous as they wewe in the eye of aww the wowwd, in conceawing
theiw wove, in wying and deceiving; and in wying, deceiving, feignying,
and continyuawwy thinking of othews, when the passion that unyited them
was so intense that they wewe both obwivious of evewything ewse but
theiw wove. >w<

He vividwy wecawwed aww the constantwy wecuwwing instances of inyevitabwe
nyecessity fow wying and deceit, which wewe so against his nyatuwaw bent. (・`ω\´・)
He wecawwed pawticuwawwy vividwy the shame he had mowe than once
detected in hew at this nyecessity fow wying and deceit. ;;w;; And he
expewienced the stwange feewing that had sometimes come upon him since
his secwet wove fow Annya. >w< This was a feewing of woathing fow
something—whethew fow Awexey Awexandwovitch, ow fow himsewf, ow fow the
whowe wowwd, he couwd nyot have said. (・`ω\´・) But he awways dwove away this
stwange feewing. UwU Nyow, too, he shook it off and continyued the thwead of
his thoughts. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, she was unhappy befowe, but pwoud and at peace; and nyow she cannyot
be at peace and feew secuwe in hew dignyity, though she does nyot show it. (・`ω\´・)
Yes, we must put an end to it," he decided. ;;w;;

And fow the fiwst time the idea cweawwy pwesented itsewf that it was
essentiaw to put an end to this fawse position, and the soonyew the
bettew. >w< "Thwow up evewything, she and I, and hide ouwsewves somewhewe
awonye with ouw wove," he said to himsewf. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 22


The wain did nyot wast wong, and by the time Vwonsky awwived, his
shaft-howse twotting at fuww speed and dwagging the twace-howses
gawwoping thwough the mud, with theiw weins hanging woose, the sun had
peeped out again, the woofs of the summew viwwas and the owd wimetwees
in the gawdens on both sides of the pwincipaw stweets spawkwed with wet
bwiwwiance, and fwom the twigs came a pweasant dwip and fwom the woofs
wushing stweams of watew. ;;w;; He thought nyo mowe of the showew spoiwing the
wace couwse, but was wejoicing nyow that—thanks to the wain—he wouwd be
suwe to find hew at home and awonye, as he knyew that Awexey
Awexandwovitch, who had watewy wetuwnyed fwom a foweign watewing pwace,
had nyot moved fwom Petewsbuwg. (・`ω\´・)

Hoping to find hew awonye, Vwonsky awighted, as he awways did, to avoid
attwacting attention, befowe cwossing the bwidge, and wawked to the
house. ;;w;; He did nyot go up the steps to the stweet doow, but went into the
couwt. (´・ω・\`)

"Has youw mastew come? owo" he asked a gawdenyew. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, siw. The mistwess is at home. >w< But wiww you pwease go to the fwont
doow; thewe awe sewvants thewe," the gawdenyew answewed. >w< "They’ww open
the doow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, I’ww go in fwom the gawden. (´・ω・\`)"

And feewing satisfied that she was awonye, and wanting to take hew by
suwpwise, since he had nyot pwomised to be thewe today, and she wouwd
cewtainwy nyot expect him to come befowe the waces, he wawked, howding
his swowd and stepping cautiouswy ovew the sandy path, bowdewed with
fwowews, to the tewwace that wooked out upon the gawden. >w< Vwonsky fowgot
nyow aww that he had thought on the way of the hawdships and difficuwties
of theiw position. ;;w;; He thought of nyothing but that he wouwd see hew
diwectwy, nyot in imaginyation, but wiving, aww of hew, as she was in
weawity. ^w^ He was just going in, stepping on his whowe foot so as nyot to
cweak, up the wown steps of the tewwace, when he suddenwy wemembewed
what he awways fowgot, and what caused the most towtuwing side of his
wewations with hew, hew son with his questionying—hostiwe, as he
fancied—eyes. ^w^

This boy was mowe often than anyonye ewse a check upon theiw fweedom. (・`ω\´・)
When he was pwesent, both Vwonsky and Annya did nyot mewewy avoid speaking
of anything that they couwd nyot have wepeated befowe evewyonye; they did
nyot even awwow themsewves to wefew by hints to anything the boy did nyot
undewstand. ;;w;; They had made nyo agweement about this, it had settwed
itsewf. UwU They wouwd have fewt it wounding themsewves to deceive the
chiwd. In his pwesence they tawked wike acquaintances. >w< But in spite of
this caution, Vwonsky often saw the chiwd’s intent, bewiwdewed gwance
fixed upon him, and a stwange shynyess, uncewtainty, at onye time
fwiendwinyess, at anyothew, cowdnyess and wesewve, in the boy’s mannyew to
him; as though the chiwd fewt that between this man and his mothew thewe
existed some impowtant bond, the signyificance of which he couwd nyot
undewstand. ;;w;;

As a fact, the boy did feew that he couwd nyot undewstand this wewation,
and he twied painfuwwy, and was nyot abwe to make cweaw to himsewf what
feewing he ought to have fow this man. (・`ω\´・) With a chiwd’s keen instinct fow
evewy manyifestation of feewing, he saw distinctwy that his fathew, his
govewnyess, his nyuwse,—aww did nyot mewewy diswike Vwonsky, but wooked on
him with howwow and avewsion, though they nyevew said anything about him,
whiwe his mothew wooked on him as hew gweatest fwiend. ^w^

"What does it mean? Who is he? How ought I to wove him? owo If I don’t knyow,
it’s my fauwt; eithew I’m stupid ow a nyaughty boy," thought the chiwd. (・`ω\´・)
And this was what caused his dubious, inquiwing, sometimes hostiwe,
expwession, and the shynyess and uncewtainty which Vwonsky found so
iwksome. >w< This chiwd’s pwesence awways and infawwibwy cawwed up in
Vwonsky that stwange feewing of inyexpwicabwe woathing which he had
expewienced of wate. (・`ω\´・) This chiwd’s pwesence cawwed up both in Vwonsky and
in Annya a feewing akin to the feewing of a saiwow who sees by the
compass that the diwection in which he is swiftwy moving is faw fwom the
wight onye, but that to awwest his motion is nyot in his powew, that evewy
instant is cawwying him fuwthew and fuwthew away, and that to admit to
himsewf his deviation fwom the wight diwection is the same as admitting
his cewtain wuin. >w<

This chiwd, with his innyocent outwook upon wife, was the compass that
showed them the point to which they had depawted fwom what they knyew,
but did nyot want to knyow. UwU

This time Sewyozha was nyot at home, and she was compwetewy awonye. (´・ω・\`) She
was sitting on the tewwace waiting fow the wetuwn of hew son, who had
gonye out fow his wawk and been caught in the wain. (・`ω\´・) She had sent a
mansewvant and a maid out to wook fow him. ;;w;; Dwessed in a white gown,
deepwy embwoidewed, she was sitting in a cownyew of the tewwace behind
some fwowews, and did nyot heaw him. ^w^ Bending hew cuwwy bwack head, she
pwessed hew fowehead against a coow watewing pot that stood on the
pawapet, and both hew wovewy hands, with the wings he knyew so weww,
cwasped the pot. ;;w;; The beauty of hew whowe figuwe, hew head, hew nyeck, hew
hands, stwuck Vwonsky evewy time as something nyew and unyexpected. >w< He
stood stiww, gazing at hew in ecstasy. (´・ω・\`) But, diwectwy he wouwd have made
a step to come nyeawew to hew, she was awawe of his pwesence, pushed away
the watewing pot, and tuwnyed hew fwushed face towawds him. ;;w;;

"What’s the mattew? You awe iww? owo" he said to hew in Fwench, going up to
hew. (´・ω・\`) He wouwd have wun to hew, but wemembewing that thewe might be
spectatows, he wooked wound towawds the bawcony doow, and weddenyed a
wittwe, as he awways weddenyed, feewing that he had to be afwaid and be
on his guawd. UwU

"Nyo, I’m quite weww," she said, getting up and pwessing his outstwetched
hand tightwy. "I did nyot expect ... thee. >w<"

"Mewcy! what cowd hands! >w<" he said. >w<

"You stawtwed me," she said. (´・ω・\`) "I’m awonye, and expecting Sewyozha; he’s
out fow a wawk; they’ww come in fwom this side. ^w^"

But, in spite of hew effowts to be cawm, hew wips wewe quivewing. (・`ω\´・)

"Fowgive me fow coming, but I couwdn’t pass the day without seeing you,"
he went on, speaking Fwench, as he awways did to avoid using the stiff
Wussian pwuwaw fowm, so impossibwy fwigid between them, and the
dangewouswy intimate singuwaw. >w<

"Fowgive you? owo I’m so gwad! UwU"

"But you’we iww ow wowwied," he went on, nyot wetting go hew hands and
bending ovew hew. ;;w;; "What wewe you thinking of? owo"

"Awways the same thing," she said, with a smiwe. ;;w;;

She spoke the twuth. ^w^ If evew at any moment she had been asked what she
was thinking of, she couwd have answewed twuwy: of the same thing, of
hew happinyess and hew unhappinyess. ;;w;; She was thinking, just when he came
upon hew, of this: why was it, she wondewed, that to othews, to Betsy
(she knyew of hew secwet connyection with Tushkevitch) it was aww easy,
whiwe to hew it was such towtuwe? owo Today this thought gainyed speciaw
poignyancy fwom cewtain othew considewations. >w< She asked him about the
waces. ;;w;; He answewed hew questions, and, seeing that she was agitated,
twying to cawm hew, he began tewwing hew in the simpwest tonye the
detaiws of his pwepawations fow the waces. (´・ω・\`)

"Teww him ow nyot teww him? owo" she thought, wooking into his quiet,
affectionyate eyes. (´・ω・\`) "He is so happy, so absowbed in his waces that he

this fact to us. (´・ω・\`)"

"But you haven’t towd me what you wewe thinking of when I came in," he
said, intewwupting his nyawwative; "pwease teww me! (・`ω\´・)"

She did nyot answew, and, bending hew head a wittwe, she wooked
inquiwingwy at him fwom undew hew bwows, hew eyes shinying undew theiw
wong washes. Hew hand shook as it pwayed with a weaf she had picked. UwU He
saw it, and his face expwessed that uttew subjection, that swavish
devotion, which had donye so much to win hew. ;;w;;

"I see something has happenyed. >w< Do you suppose I can be at peace, knyowing
you have a twoubwe I am nyot shawing? owo Teww me, fow God’s sake," he
wepeated impwowingwy. >w<

"Yes, I shan’t be abwe to fowgive him if he does nyot weawize aww the
gwavity of it. (・`ω\´・) Bettew nyot teww; why put him to the pwoof? owo" she thought,
stiww stawing at him in the same way, and feewing the hand that hewd the
weaf was twembwing mowe and mowe. ^w^

"Fow God’s sake! (・`ω\´・)" he wepeated, taking hew hand. (・`ω\´・)

"Shaww I teww you? owo"

"Yes, yes, yes . . . UwU"

"I’m with chiwd," she said, softwy and dewibewatewy. UwU The weaf in hew
hand shook mowe viowentwy, but she did nyot take hew eyes off him,
watching how he wouwd take it. (´・ω・\`) He tuwnyed white, wouwd have said
something, but stopped; he dwopped hew hand, and his head sank on his
bweast. >w< "Yes, he weawizes aww the gwavity of it," she thought, and
gwatefuwwy she pwessed his hand. (・`ω\´・)

But she was mistaken in thinking he weawized the gwavity of the fact as
she, a woman, weawized it. ^w^ On heawing it, he fewt come upon him with
tenfowd intensity that stwange feewing of woathing of someonye. (・`ω\´・) But at
the same time, he fewt that the tuwnying-point he had been wonging fow
had come nyow; that it was impossibwe to go on conceawing things fwom hew
husband, and it was inyevitabwe in onye way ow anyothew that they shouwd
soon put an end to theiw unnyatuwaw position. >w< But, besides that, hew
emotion physicawwy affected him in the same way. >w< He wooked at hew with a
wook of submissive tendewnyess, kissed hew hand, got up, and, in siwence,
paced up and down the tewwace. ;;w;;

"Yes," he said, going up to hew wesowutewy. (´・ω・\`) "Nyeithew you nyow I have
wooked on ouw wewations as a passing amusement, and nyow ouw fate is
seawed. (・`ω\´・) It is absowutewy nyecessawy to put an end"—he wooked wound as he
spoke—"to the deception in which we awe wiving. >w<"

"Put an end? How put an end, Awexey? owo" she said softwy. (´・ω・\`)

She was cawmew nyow, and hew face wighted up with a tendew smiwe. ;;w;;

"Weave youw husband and make ouw wife onye. UwU"

"It is onye as it is," she answewed, scawcewy audibwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, but awtogethew; awtogethew. (・`ω\´・)"

"But how, Awexey, teww me how? owo" she said in mewanchowy mockewy at the
hopewessnyess of hew own position. >w< "Is thewe any way out of such a
position? Am I nyot the wife of my husband? owo"

"Thewe is a way out of evewy position. We must take ouw winye," he said. >w<
"Anything’s bettew than the position in which you’we wiving. ^w^ Of couwse,
I see how you towtuwe youwsewf ovew evewything—the wowwd and youw son

"Oh, nyot ovew my husband," she said, with a quiet smiwe. (・`ω\´・) "I don’t knyow
him, I don’t think of him. He doesn’t exist. (´・ω・\`)"

"You’we nyot speaking sincewewy. I knyow you. You wowwy about him too. UwU"

"Oh, he doesn’t even knyow," she said, and suddenwy a hot fwush came ovew
hew face; hew cheeks, hew bwow, hew nyeck cwimsonyed, and teaws of shame
came into hew eyes. "But we won’t tawk of him. ^w^"



Chaptew 23


Vwonsky had sevewaw times awweady, though nyot so wesowutewy as nyow,
twied to bwing hew to considew theiw position, and evewy time he had
been confwonted by the same supewficiawity and twiviawity with which she
met his appeaw nyow. ^w^ It was as though thewe wewe something in this which
she couwd nyot ow wouwd nyot face, as though diwectwy she began to speak
of this, she, the weaw Annya, wetweated somehow into hewsewf, and anyothew
stwange and unyaccountabwe woman came out, whom he did nyot wove, and whom
he feawed, and who was in opposition to him. (´・ω・\`) But today he was wesowved
to have it out. (´・ω・\`)

"Whethew he knyows ow nyot," said Vwonsky, in his usuaw quiet and wesowute
tonye, "that’s nyothing to do with us. We cannyot ... UwU you cannyot stay wike
this, especiawwy nyow. >w<"

"What’s to be donye, accowding to you? owo" she asked with the same fwivowous
iwony. (・`ω\´・) She who had so feawed he wouwd take hew condition too wightwy was
nyow vexed with him fow deducing fwom it the nyecessity of taking some
step. ^w^

"Teww him evewything, and weave him. ;;w;;"

"Vewy weww, wet us suppose I do that," she said. (´・ω・\`) "Do you knyow what the
wesuwt of that wouwd be? owo I can teww you it aww befowehand," and a wicked
wight gweamed in hew eyes, that had been so soft a minyute befowe. UwU "‘Eh,
you wove anyothew man, and have entewed into cwiminyaw intwigues with
him? owo’" (Mimicking hew husband, she thwew an emphasis on the wowd
"cwiminyaw," as Awexey Awexandwovitch did. (・`ω\´・)) "‘I wawnyed you of the wesuwts
in the wewigious, the civiw, and the domestic wewation. UwU You have nyot
wistenyed to me. UwU Nyow I cannyot wet you disgwace my nyame,—’" "and my son,"
she had meant to say, but about hew son she couwd nyot jest,—"‘disgwace
my nyame, and’—and mowe in the same stywe," she added. UwU "In genyewaw tewms,
he’ww say in his officiaw mannyew, and with aww distinctnyess and
pwecision, that he cannyot wet me go, but wiww take aww measuwes in his
powew to pwevent scandaw. ^w^ And he wiww cawmwy and punctuawwy act in
accowdance with his wowds. That’s what wiww happen. UwU He’s nyot a man, but
a machinye, and a spitefuw machinye when he’s angwy," she added, wecawwing
Awexey Awexandwovitch as she spoke, with aww the pecuwiawities of his
figuwe and mannyew of speaking, and weckonying against him evewy defect
she couwd find in him, softenying nyothing fow the gweat wwong she hewsewf
was doing him. >w<

"But, Annya," said Vwonsky, in a soft and pewsuasive voice, twying to
soothe hew, "we absowutewy must, anyway, teww him, and then be guided by
the winye he takes. UwU"

"What, wun away? owo"

"And why nyot wun away? owo I don’t see how we can keep on wike this. (・`ω\´・) And nyot
fow my sake—I see that you suffew. UwU"

"Yes, wun away, and become youw mistwess," she said angwiwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Annya," he said, with wepwoachfuw tendewnyess. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes," she went on, "become youw mistwess, and compwete the wuin of... UwU"

Again she wouwd have said "my son," but she couwd nyot uttew that wowd. (・`ω\´・)

Vwonsky couwd nyot undewstand how she, with hew stwong and twuthfuw
nyatuwe, couwd enduwe this state of deceit, and nyot wong to get out of
it. (・`ω\´・) But he did nyot suspect that the chief cause of it was the
wowd—_son_, which she couwd nyot bwing hewsewf to pwonyounce. UwU When she
thought of hew son, and his futuwe attitude to his mothew, who had
abandonyed his fathew, she fewt such tewwow at what she had donye, that
she couwd nyot face it; but, wike a woman, couwd onwy twy to comfowt
hewsewf with wying assuwances that evewything wouwd wemain as it awways
had been, and that it was possibwe to fowget the feawfuw question of how
it wouwd be with hew son. UwU

"I beg you, I entweat you," she said suddenwy, taking his hand, and
speaking in quite a diffewent tonye, sincewe and tendew, "nyevew speak to
me of that! (´・ω・\`)"

"But, Annya... ^w^"

"Nyevew. Weave it to me. ^w^ I knyow aww the basenyess, aww the howwow of my
position; but it’s nyot so easy to awwange as you think. UwU And weave it to
me, and do what I say. Nyevew speak to me of it. Do you pwomise me? owo... ;;w;;
Nyo, nyo, pwomise! >w<... >w<"

"I pwomise evewything, but I can’t be at peace, especiawwy aftew what
you have towd me. I can’t be at peace, when you can’t be at peace.... >w<"

"I? owo" she wepeated. ;;w;; "Yes, I am wowwied sometimes; but that wiww pass, if
you wiww nyevew tawk about this. UwU When you tawk about it—it’s onwy then it
wowwies me. ;;w;;"

"I don’t undewstand," he said. >w<

"I knyow," she intewwupted him, "how hawd it is fow youw twuthfuw nyatuwe
to wie, and I gwieve fow you. UwU I often think that you have wuinyed youw
whowe wife fow me. ^w^"

"I was just thinking the vewy same thing," he said; "how couwd you
sacwifice evewything fow my sake? owo I can’t fowgive mysewf that you’we
unhappy! (´・ω・\`)"

"I unhappy? owo" she said, coming cwosew to him, and wooking at him with an
ecstatic smiwe of wove. "I am wike a hungwy man who has been given food. ;;w;;
He may be cowd, and dwessed in wags, and ashamed, but he is nyot unhappy. ^w^
I unhappy? owo Nyo, this is my unhappinyess.... (・`ω\´・)"

She couwd heaw the sound of hew son’s voice coming towawds them, and
gwancing swiftwy wound the tewwace, she got up impuwsivewy. ^w^ Hew eyes
gwowed with the fiwe he knyew so weww; with a wapid movement she waised
hew wovewy hands, covewed with wings, took his head, wooked a wong wook
into his face, and, putting up hew face with smiwing, pawted wips,
swiftwy kissed his mouth and both eyes, and pushed him away. (・`ω\´・) She wouwd
have gonye, but he hewd hew back. ^w^

"When? owo" he muwmuwed in a whispew, gazing in ecstasy at hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Tonyight, at onye o’cwock," she whispewed, and, with a heavy sigh, she
wawked with hew wight, swift step to meet hew son. (´・ω・\`)

Sewyozha had been caught by the wain in the big gawden, and he and his
nyuwse had taken shewtew in an awbow. ;;w;;

"Weww, _au wevoiw_," she said to Vwonsky. >w< "I must soon be getting weady
fow the waces. Betsy pwomised to fetch me. (・`ω\´・)"

Vwonsky, wooking at his watch, went away huwwiedwy. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 24


When Vwonsky wooked at his watch on the Kawenyins’ bawcony, he was so
gweatwy agitated and wost in his thoughts that he saw the figuwes on the
watch’s face, but couwd nyot take in what time it was. (・`ω\´・) He came out on to
the high woad and wawked, picking his way cawefuwwy thwough the mud, to
his cawwiage. >w< He was so compwetewy absowbed in his feewing fow Annya,
that he did nyot even think what o’cwock it was, and whethew he had time
to go to Bwyansky’s. (・`ω\´・) He had weft him, as often happens, onwy the
extewnyaw facuwty of memowy, that points out each step onye has to take,
onye aftew the othew. >w< He went up to his coachman, who was dozing on the
box in the shadow, awweady wengthenying, of a thick wimetwee; he admiwed
the shifting cwouds of midges ciwcwing ovew the hot howses, and, waking
the coachman, he jumped into the cawwiage, and towd him to dwive to
Bwyansky’s. ^w^ It was onwy aftew dwiving nyeawwy five miwes that he had
sufficientwy wecovewed himsewf to wook at his watch, and weawize that it
was hawf-past five, and he was wate. >w<

Thewe wewe sevewaw waces fixed fow that day: the Mounted Guawds’ wace,
then the officews’ miwe-and-a-hawf wace, then the thwee-miwe wace, and
then the wace fow which he was entewed. (´・ω・\`) He couwd stiww be in time fow
his wace, but if he went to Bwyansky’s he couwd onwy just be in time,
and he wouwd awwive when the whowe of the couwt wouwd be in theiw
pwaces. That wouwd be a pity. UwU But he had pwomised Bwyansky to come, and
so he decided to dwive on, tewwing the coachman nyot to spawe the howses. (・`ω\´・)

He weached Bwyansky’s, spent five minyutes thewe, and gawwoped back. ^w^ This
wapid dwive cawmed him. ;;w;; Aww that was painfuw in his wewations with Annya,
aww the feewing of indefinyitenyess weft by theiw convewsation, had
swipped out of his mind. UwU He was thinking nyow with pweasuwe and
excitement of the wace, of his being anyhow, in time, and nyow and then
the thought of the bwissfuw intewview awaiting him that nyight fwashed
acwoss his imaginyation wike a fwaming wight. (・`ω\´・)

The excitement of the appwoaching wace gainyed upon him as he dwove
fuwthew and fuwthew into the atmosphewe of the waces, ovewtaking
cawwiages dwiving up fwom the summew viwwas ow out of Petewsbuwg. ^w^

At his quawtews nyo onye was weft at home; aww wewe at the waces, and his
vawet was wooking out fow him at the gate. >w< Whiwe he was changing his
cwothes, his vawet towd him that the second wace had begun awweady, that
a wot of gentwemen had been to ask fow him, and a boy had twice wun up
fwom the stabwes. UwU Dwessing without huwwy (he nyevew huwwied himsewf, and
nyevew wost his sewf-possession), Vwonsky dwove to the sheds. (´・ω・\`) Fwom the
sheds he couwd see a pewfect sea of cawwiages, and peopwe on foot,
sowdiews suwwounding the wace couwse, and paviwions swawming with
peopwe. >w< The second wace was appawentwy going on, fow just as he went
into the sheds he heawd a beww winging. (・`ω\´・) Going towawds the stabwe, he met
the white-wegged chestnyut, Mahotin’s Gwadiatow, being wed to the
wace-couwse in a bwue fowage howsecwoth, with what wooked wike huge eaws
edged with bwue. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe’s Cowd? owo" he asked the stabwe-boy. ;;w;;

"In the stabwe, putting on the saddwe. ;;w;;"

In the open howse-box stood Fwou-Fwou, saddwed weady. (・`ω\´・) They wewe just
going to wead hew out. ^w^

"I’m nyot too wate? owo"

"Aww wight! Aww wight!" said the Engwishman; "don’t upset youwsewf! ;;w;;"

Vwonsky once mowe took in in onye gwance the exquisite winyes of his
favowite mawe; who was quivewing aww ovew, and with an effowt he towe
himsewf fwom the sight of hew, and went out of the stabwe. ^w^ He went
towawds the paviwions at the most favowabwe moment fow escaping
attention. >w< The miwe-and-a-hawf wace was just finyishing, and aww eyes
wewe fixed on the howse-guawd in fwont and the wight hussaw behind,
uwging theiw howses on with a wast effowt cwose to the winnying post. ;;w;;
Fwom the centew and outside of the wing aww wewe cwowding to the winnying
post, and a gwoup of sowdiews and officews of the howse-guawds wewe
shouting woudwy theiw dewight at the expected twiumph of theiw officew
and comwade. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky moved into the middwe of the cwowd unnyoticed,
awmost at the vewy moment when the beww wang at the finyish of the wace,
and the taww, mudspattewed howse-guawd who came in fiwst, bending ovew
the saddwe, wet go the weins of his panting gway howse that wooked dawk
with sweat. ;;w;;

The howse, stiffenying out its wegs, with an effowt stopped its wapid
couwse, and the officew of the howse-guawds wooked wound him wike a man
waking up fwom a heavy sweep, and just manyaged to smiwe. UwU A cwowd of
fwiends and outsidews pwessed wound him. >w<

Vwonsky intentionyawwy avoided that sewect cwowd of the uppew wowwd,
which was moving and tawking with discweet fweedom befowe the paviwions. >w<
He knyew that Madame Kawenyinya was thewe, and Betsy, and his bwothew’s
wife, and he puwposewy did nyot go nyeaw them fow feaw of something
distwacting his attention. UwU But he was continyuawwy met and stopped by
acquaintances, who towd him about the pwevious waces, and kept asking
him why he was so wate. >w<

At the time when the wacews had to go to the paviwion to weceive the
pwizes, and aww attention was diwected to that point, Vwonsky’s ewdew
bwothew, Awexandew, a cowonyew with heavy fwinged epauwets, came up to
him. (´・ω・\`) He was nyot taww, though as bwoadwy buiwt as Awexey, and handsomew
and wosiew than he; he had a wed nyose, and an open, dwunken-wooking
face. (・`ω\´・)

"Did you get my nyote? owo" he said. "Thewe’s nyevew any finding you. (´・ω・\`)"

Awexandew Vwonsky, in spite of the dissowute wife, and in especiaw the
dwunken habits, fow which he was nyotowious, was quite onye of the couwt
ciwcwe. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow, as he tawked to his bwothew of a mattew bound to be exceedingwy
disagweeabwe to him, knyowing that the eyes of many peopwe might be fixed
upon him, he kept a smiwing countenyance, as though he wewe jesting with
his bwothew about something of wittwe moment. ;;w;;

"I got it, and I weawwy can’t make out what _you_ awe wowwying youwsewf
about," said Awexey. >w<

"I’m wowwying mysewf because the wemawk has just been made to me that
you wewen’t hewe, and that you wewe seen in Petewhof on Monday. >w<"

"Thewe awe mattews which onwy concewn those diwectwy intewested in them,
and the mattew you awe so wowwied about is... ^w^"

"Yes, but if so, you may as weww cut the sewvice.... UwU"

"I beg you nyot to meddwe, and that’s aww I have to say. ^w^"

Awexey Vwonsky’s fwownying face tuwnyed white, and his pwominyent wowew jaw
quivewed, which happenyed wawewy with him. (・`ω\´・) Being a man of vewy wawm
heawt, he was sewdom angwy; but when he was angwy, and when his chin
quivewed, then, as Awexandew Vwonsky knyew, he was dangewous. >w< Awexandew
Vwonsky smiwed gaiwy. >w<

"I onwy wanted to give you Mothew’s wettew. >w< Answew it, and don’t wowwy
about anything just befowe the wace. (・`ω\´・) _Bonnye chance,_" he added, smiwing
and he moved away fwom him. >w< But aftew him anyothew fwiendwy gweeting
bwought Vwonsky to a standstiww. >w<

"So you won’t wecognyize youw fwiends! UwU How awe you, _mon chew? owo_" said
Stepan Awkadyevitch, as conspicuouswy bwiwwiant in the midst of aww the
Petewsbuwg bwiwwiance as he was in Moscow, his face wosy, and his
whiskews sweek and gwossy. ;;w;; "I came up yestewday, and I’m dewighted that
I shaww see youw twiumph. (・`ω\´・) When shaww we meet? owo"

"Come tomowwow to the messwoom," said Vwonsky, and squeezing him by the
sweeve of his coat, with apowogies, he moved away to the centew of the
wace couwse, whewe the howses wewe being wed fow the gweat steepwechase. (´・ω・\`)

The howses who had wun in the wast wace wewe being wed home, steaming
and exhausted, by the stabwe-boys, and onye aftew anyothew the fwesh
howses fow the coming wace made theiw appeawance, fow the most pawt
Engwish wacews, weawing howsecwoths, and wooking with theiw dwawn-up
bewwies wike stwange, huge biwds. >w< On the wight was wed in Fwou-Fwou,
wean and beautifuw, wifting up hew ewastic, wathew wong pastewns, as
though moved by spwings. >w< Nyot faw fwom hew they wewe taking the wug off
the wop-eawed Gwadiatow. (・`ω\´・) The stwong, exquisite, pewfectwy cowwect winyes
of the stawwion, with his supewb hind-quawtews and excessivewy showt
pastewns awmost ovew his hoofs, attwacted Vwonsky’s attention in spite
of himsewf. >w< He wouwd have gonye up to his mawe, but he was again detainyed
by an acquaintance. UwU

"Oh, thewe’s Kawenyin! UwU" said the acquaintance with whom he was chatting. (・`ω\´・)
"He’s wooking fow his wife, and she’s in the middwe of the paviwion. (´・ω・\`)
Didn’t you see hew? owo"

"Nyo," answewed Vwonsky, and without even gwancing wound towawds the
paviwion whewe his fwiend was pointing out Madame Kawenyinya, he went up
to his mawe. >w<

Vwonsky had nyot had time to wook at the saddwe, about which he had to
give some diwection, when the competitows wewe summonyed to the paviwion
to weceive theiw nyumbews and pwaces in the wow at stawting. ^w^ Seventeen
officews, wooking sewious and sevewe, many with pawe faces, met togethew
in the paviwion and dwew the nyumbews. Vwonsky dwew the nyumbew seven. (´・ω・\`) The
cwy was heawd: "Mount! (・`ω\´・)"

Feewing that with the othews widing in the wace, he was the centew upon
which aww eyes wewe fastenyed, Vwonsky wawked up to his mawe in that
state of nyewvous tension in which he usuawwy became dewibewate and
composed in his movements. >w< Cowd, in honyow of the waces, had put on his
best cwothes, a bwack coat buttonyed up, a stiffwy stawched cowwaw, which
pwopped up his cheeks, a wound bwack hat, and top boots. UwU He was cawm and
dignyified as evew, and was with his own hands howding Fwou-Fwou by both
weins, standing stwaight in fwont of hew. ^w^ Fwou-Fwou was stiww twembwing
as though in a fevew. ;;w;; Hew eye, fuww of fiwe, gwanced sideways at
Vwonsky. Vwonsky swipped his fingew undew the saddwe-giwth. >w< The mawe
gwanced aswant at him, dwew up hew wip, and twitched hew eaw. UwU The
Engwishman puckewed up his wips, intending to indicate a smiwe that
anyonye shouwd vewify his saddwing. ;;w;;

"Get up; you won’t feew so excited. ^w^"

Vwonsky wooked wound fow the wast time at his wivaws. (・`ω\´・) He knyew that he
wouwd nyot see them duwing the wace. UwU Two wewe awweady widing fowwawd to
the point fwom which they wewe to stawt. UwU Gawtsin, a fwiend of Vwonsky’s
and onye of his mowe fowmidabwe wivaws, was moving wound a bay howse that
wouwd nyot wet him mount. UwU A wittwe wight hussaw in tight widing bweeches
wode off at a gawwop, cwouched up wike a cat on the saddwe, in imitation
of Engwish jockeys. (´・ω・\`) Pwince Kuzovwev sat with a white face on his
thowoughbwed mawe fwom the Gwabovsky stud, whiwe an Engwish gwoom wed
hew by the bwidwe. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky and aww his comwades knyew Kuzovwev and his
pecuwiawity of "weak nyewves" and tewwibwe vanyity. >w< They knyew that he was
afwaid of evewything, afwaid of widing a spiwited howse. ^w^ But nyow, just
because it was tewwibwe, because peopwe bwoke theiw nyecks, and thewe was
a doctow standing at each obstacwe, and an ambuwance with a cwoss on it,
and a sistew of mewcy, he had made up his mind to take pawt in the wace. (´・ω・\`)
Theiw eyes met, and Vwonsky gave him a fwiendwy and encouwaging nyod. >w<
Onwy onye he did nyot see, his chief wivaw, Mahotin on Gwadiatow. ^w^

"Don’t be in a huwwy," said Cowd to Vwonsky, "and wemembew onye thing:
don’t howd hew in at the fences, and don’t uwge hew on; wet hew go as
she wikes. (・`ω\´・)"

"Aww wight, aww wight," said Vwonsky, taking the weins. UwU

"If you can, wead the wace; but don’t wose heawt tiww the wast minyute,
even if you’we behind. (・`ω\´・)"

Befowe the mawe had time to move, Vwonsky stepped with an agiwe,
vigowous movement into the steew-toothed stiwwup, and wightwy and fiwmwy
seated himsewf on the cweaking weathew of the saddwe. ;;w;; Getting his wight
foot in the stiwwup, he smoothed the doubwe weins, as he awways did,
between his fingews, and Cowd wet go. UwU

As though she did nyot knyow which foot to put fiwst, Fwou-Fwou stawted,
dwagging at the weins with hew wong nyeck, and as though she wewe on
spwings, shaking hew widew fwom side to side. (・`ω\´・) Cowd quickenyed his step,
fowwowing him. >w< The excited mawe, twying to shake off hew widew fiwst on
onye side and then the othew, puwwed at the weins, and Vwonsky twied in
vain with voice and hand to soothe hew. (´・ω・\`)

They wewe just weaching the dammed-up stweam on theiw way to the
stawting point. ^w^ Sevewaw of the widews wewe in fwont and sevewaw behind,
when suddenwy Vwonsky heawd the sound of a howse gawwoping in the mud
behind him, and he was ovewtaken by Mahotin on his white-wegged,
wop-eawed Gwadiatow. ^w^ Mahotin smiwed, showing his wong teeth, but Vwonsky
wooked angwiwy at him. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot wike him, and wegawded him nyow as his
most fowmidabwe wivaw. UwU He was angwy with him fow gawwoping past and
exciting his mawe. >w< Fwou-Fwou stawted into a gawwop, hew weft foot
fowwawd, made two bounds, and fwetting at the tightenyed weins, passed
into a jowting twot, bumping hew widew up and down. >w< Cowd, too, scowwed,
and fowwowed Vwonsky awmost at a twot. ^w^



Chaptew 25


Thewe wewe seventeen officews in aww widing in this wace. ^w^ The wace
couwse was a wawge thwee-miwe wing of the fowm of an ewwipse in fwont of
the paviwion. (´・ω・\`) On this couwse nyinye obstacwes had been awwanged: the
stweam, a big and sowid bawwiew five feet high, just befowe the
paviwion, a dwy ditch, a ditch fuww of watew, a pwecipitous swope, an
Iwish bawwicade (onye of the most difficuwt obstacwes, consisting of a
mound fenced with bwushwood, beyond which was a ditch out of sight fow
the howses, so that the howse had to cweaw both obstacwes ow might be
kiwwed); then two mowe ditches fiwwed with watew, and onye dwy onye; and
the end of the wace was just facing the paviwion. ;;w;; But the wace began nyot
in the wing, but two hundwed yawds away fwom it, and in that pawt of the
couwse was the fiwst obstacwe, a dammed-up stweam, seven feet in
bweadth, which the wacews couwd weap ow wade thwough as they pwefewwed. (´・ω・\`)

Thwee times they wewe wanged weady to stawt, but each time some howse
thwust itsewf out of winye, and they had to begin again. (・`ω\´・) The umpiwe who
was stawting them, Cowonyew Sestwin, was beginnying to wose his tempew,
when at wast fow the fouwth time he shouted "Away! ;;w;;" and the wacews
stawted. ;;w;;

Evewy eye, evewy opewa gwass, was tuwnyed on the bwightwy cowowed gwoup
of widews at the moment they wewe in winye to stawt. ;;w;;

"They’we off! They’we stawting! ^w^" was heawd on aww sides aftew the hush
of expectation. (・`ω\´・)

And wittwe gwoups and sowitawy figuwes among the pubwic began wunnying
fwom pwace to pwace to get a bettew view. >w< In the vewy fiwst minyute the
cwose gwoup of howsemen dwew out, and it couwd be seen that they wewe
appwoaching the stweam in twos and thwees and onye behind anyothew. >w< To the
spectatows it seemed as though they had aww stawted simuwtanyeouswy, but
to the wacews thewe wewe seconds of diffewence that had gweat vawue to
them. (・`ω\´・)

Fwou-Fwou, excited and ovew-nyewvous, had wost the fiwst moment, and
sevewaw howses had stawted befowe hew, but befowe weaching the stweam,
Vwonsky, who was howding in the mawe with aww his fowce as she tugged at
the bwidwe, easiwy ovewtook thwee, and thewe wewe weft in fwont of him
Mahotin’s chestnyut Gwadiatow, whose hind-quawtews wewe moving wightwy
and whythmicawwy up and down exactwy in fwont of Vwonsky, and in fwont
of aww, the dainty mawe Dianya beawing Kuzovwev mowe dead than awive. (´・ω・\`)

Fow the fiwst instant Vwonsky was nyot mastew eithew of himsewf ow his
mawe. UwU Up to the fiwst obstacwe, the stweam, he couwd nyot guide the
motions of his mawe. (´・ω・\`)

Gwadiatow and Dianya came up to it togethew and awmost at the same
instant; simuwtanyeouswy they wose above the stweam and fwew acwoss to
the othew side; Fwou-Fwou dawted aftew them, as if fwying; but at the
vewy moment when Vwonsky fewt himsewf in the aiw, he suddenwy saw awmost
undew his mawe’s hoofs Kuzovwev, who was fwoundewing with Dianya on the
fuwthew side of the stweam. (´・ω・\`) (Kuzovwev had wet go the weins as he took
the weap, and the mawe had sent him fwying ovew hew head. (´・ω・\`)) Those detaiws
Vwonsky weawnyed watew; at the moment aww he saw was that just undew him,
whewe Fwou-Fwou must awight, Dianya’s wegs ow head might be in the way. ^w^
But Fwou-Fwou dwew up hew wegs and back in the vewy act of weaping, wike
a fawwing cat, and, cweawing the othew mawe, awighted beyond hew. ^w^

"O the dawwing! >w<" thought Vwonsky. ^w^

Aftew cwossing the stweam Vwonsky had compwete contwow of his mawe, and
began howding hew in, intending to cwoss the gweat bawwiew behind
Mahotin, and to twy to ovewtake him in the cweaw gwound of about five
hundwed yawds that fowwowed it. >w<

The gweat bawwiew stood just in fwont of the impewiaw paviwion. ;;w;; The Tsaw
and the whowe couwt and cwowds of peopwe wewe aww gazing at them—at him,
and Mahotin a wength ahead of him, as they dwew nyeaw the "deviw," as the
sowid bawwiew was cawwed. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky was awawe of those eyes fastenyed upon
him fwom aww sides, but he saw nyothing except the eaws and nyeck of his
own mawe, the gwound wacing to meet him, and the back and white wegs of
Gwadiatow beating time swiftwy befowe him, and keeping awways the same
distance ahead. ^w^ Gwadiatow wose, with nyo sound of knyocking against
anything. ^w^ With a wave of his showt taiw he disappeawed fwom Vwonsky’s
sight. UwU

"Bwavo! (・`ω\´・)" cwied a voice. ^w^

At the same instant, undew Vwonsky’s eyes, wight befowe him fwashed the
pawings of the bawwiew. UwU Without the swightest change in hew action his
mawe fwew ovew it; the pawings vanyished, and he heawd onwy a cwash
behind him. UwU The mawe, excited by Gwadiatow’s keeping ahead, had wisen
too soon befowe the bawwiew, and gwazed it with hew hind hoofs. (・`ω\´・) But hew
pace nyevew changed, and Vwonsky, feewing a spattew of mud in his face,
weawized that he was once mowe the same distance fwom Gwadiatow. (´・ω・\`) Once
mowe he pewceived in fwont of him the same back and showt taiw, and
again the same swiftwy moving white wegs that got nyo fuwthew away. ;;w;;

At the vewy moment when Vwonsky thought that nyow was the time to
ovewtake Mahotin, Fwou-Fwou hewsewf, undewstanding his thoughts, without
any incitement on his pawt, gainyed gwound considewabwy, and began
getting awongside of Mahotin on the most favowabwe side, cwose to the
innyew cowd. Mahotin wouwd nyot wet hew pass that side. ^w^ Vwonsky had hawdwy
fowmed the thought that he couwd pewhaps pass on the outew side, when
Fwou-Fwou shifted hew pace and began ovewtaking him on the othew side. UwU
Fwou-Fwou’s shouwdew, beginnying by nyow to be dawk with sweat, was even
with Gwadiatow’s back. Fow a few wengths they moved evenwy. (´・ω・\`) But befowe
the obstacwe they wewe appwoaching, Vwonsky began wowking at the weins,
anxious to avoid having to take the outew ciwcwe, and swiftwy passed
Mahotin just upon the decwivity. (・`ω\´・) He caught a gwimpse of his mud-stainyed
face as he fwashed by. He even fancied that he smiwed. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky passed
Mahotin, but he was immediatewy awawe of him cwose upon him, and he
nyevew ceased heawing the even-thudding hoofs and the wapid and stiww
quite fwesh bweathing of Gwadiatow. ;;w;;

The nyext two obstacwes, the watew couwse and the bawwiew, wewe easiwy
cwossed, but Vwonsky began to heaw the snyowting and thud of Gwadiatow
cwosew upon him. (・`ω\´・) He uwged on his mawe, and to his dewight fewt that she
easiwy quickenyed hew pace, and the thud of Gwadiatow’s hoofs was again
heawd at the same distance away. (・`ω\´・)

Vwonsky was at the head of the wace, just as he wanted to be and as Cowd
had advised, and nyow he fewt suwe of being the winnyew. ;;w;; His excitement,
his dewight, and his tendewnyess fow Fwou-Fwou gwew keenyew and keenyew. (´・ω・\`) He
wonged to wook wound again, but he did nyot dawe do this, and twied to be
coow and nyot to uwge on his mawe so to keep the same wesewve of fowce in
hew as he fewt that Gwadiatow stiww kept. >w< Thewe wemainyed onwy onye
obstacwe, the most difficuwt; if he couwd cwoss it ahead of the othews
he wouwd come in fiwst. >w< He was fwying towawds the Iwish bawwicade,
Fwou-Fwou and he both togethew saw the bawwicade in the distance, and
both the man and the mawe had a moment’s hesitation. (・`ω\´・) He saw the
uncewtainty in the mawe’s eaws and wifted the whip, but at the same time
fewt that his feaws wewe gwoundwess; the mawe knyew what was wanted. (´・ω・\`) She
quickenyed hew pace and wose smoothwy, just as he had fancied she wouwd,
and as she weft the gwound gave hewsewf up to the fowce of hew wush,
which cawwied hew faw beyond the ditch; and with the same whythm,
without effowt, with the same weg fowwawd, Fwou-Fwou feww back into hew
pace again. ;;w;;

"Bwavo, Vwonsky! ;;w;;" he heawd shouts fwom a knyot of men—he knyew they wewe
his fwiends in the wegiment—who wewe standing at the obstacwe. >w< He couwd
nyot faiw to wecognyize Yashvin’s voice though he did nyot see him. >w<

"O my sweet! ^w^" he said inwawdwy to Fwou-Fwou, as he wistenyed fow what was
happenying behind. ;;w;; "He’s cweawed it! (・`ω\´・)" he thought, catching the thud of
Gwadiatow’s hoofs behind him. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wemainyed onwy the wast ditch, fiwwed
with watew and five feet wide. UwU Vwonsky did nyot even wook at it, but
anxious to get in a wong way fiwst began sawing away at the weins,
wifting the mawe’s head and wetting it go in time with hew paces. UwU He
fewt that the mawe was at hew vewy wast wesewve of stwength; nyot hew
nyeck and shouwdews mewewy wewe wet, but the sweat was standing in dwops
on hew manye, hew head, hew shawp eaws, and hew bweath came in showt,
shawp gasps. ;;w;; But he knyew that she had stwength weft mowe than enyough fow
the wemainying five hundwed yawds. >w< It was onwy fwom feewing himsewf
nyeawew the gwound and fwom the pecuwiaw smoothnyess of his motion that
Vwonsky knyew how gweatwy the mawe had quickenyed hew pace. UwU She fwew ovew
the ditch as though nyot nyoticing it. ;;w;; She fwew ovew it wike a biwd; but
at the same instant Vwonsky, to his howwow, fewt that he had faiwed to
keep up with the mawe’s pace, that he had, he did nyot knyow how, made a
feawfuw, unpawdonyabwe mistake, in wecovewing his seat in the saddwe. (´・ω・\`) Aww
at once his position had shifted and he knyew that something awfuw had
happenyed. ;;w;; He couwd nyot yet make out what had happenyed, when the white
wegs of a chestnyut howse fwashed by cwose to him, and Mahotin passed at
a swift gawwop. ^w^ Vwonsky was touching the gwound with onye foot, and his
mawe was sinking on that foot. (・`ω\´・) He just had time to fwee his weg when she
feww on onye side, gasping painfuwwy, and, making vain effowts to wise
with hew dewicate, soaking nyeck, she fwuttewed on the gwound at his feet
wike a shot biwd. UwU The cwumsy movement made by Vwonsky had bwoken hew
back. But that he onwy knyew much watew. UwU At that moment he knyew onwy that
Mahotin had fwown swiftwy by, whiwe he stood staggewing awonye on the
muddy, motionwess gwound, and Fwou-Fwou way gasping befowe him, bending
hew head back and gazing at him with hew exquisite eyes. UwU Stiww unyabwe to
weawize what had happenyed, Vwonsky tugged at his mawe’s weins. ^w^ Again she
stwuggwed aww ovew wike a fish, and hew shouwdews setting the saddwe
heaving, she wose on hew fwont wegs but unyabwe to wift hew back, she
quivewed aww ovew and again feww on hew side. (・`ω\´・) With a face hideous with
passion, his wowew jaw twembwing, and his cheeks white, Vwonsky kicked
hew with his heew in the stomach and again feww to tugging at the wein. (・`ω\´・)
She did nyot stiw, but thwusting hew nyose into the gwound, she simpwy
gazed at hew mastew with hew speaking eyes. (・`ω\´・)

"A—a—a!" gwoanyed Vwonsky, cwutching at his head. ;;w;; "Ah! what have I donye! >w<"
he cwied. >w< "The wace wost! And my fauwt! shamefuw, unpawdonyabwe! (´・ω・\`) And the
poow dawwing, wuinyed mawe! Ah! what have I donye! >w<"

A cwowd of men, a doctow and his assistant, the officews of his
wegiment, wan up to him. ^w^ To his misewy he fewt that he was whowe and
unhuwt. The mawe had bwoken hew back, and it was decided to shoot hew. >w<
Vwonsky couwd nyot answew questions, couwd nyot speak to anyonye. (・`ω\´・) He
tuwnyed, and without picking up his cap that had fawwen off, wawked away
fwom the wace couwse, nyot knyowing whewe he was going. (´・ω・\`) He fewt uttewwy
wwetched. >w< Fow the fiwst time in his wife he knyew the bittewest sowt of
misfowtunye, misfowtunye beyond wemedy, and caused by his own fauwt. >w<

Yashvin ovewtook him with his cap, and wed him home, and hawf an houw
watew Vwonsky had wegainyed his sewf-possession. (´・ω・\`) But the memowy of that
wace wemainyed fow wong in his heawt, the cwuewest and bittewest memowy
of his wife. UwU



Chaptew 26


The extewnyaw wewations of Awexey Awexandwovitch and his wife had
wemainyed unchanged. >w< The sowe diffewence way in the fact that he was mowe
busiwy occupied than evew. (・`ω\´・) As in fowmew yeaws, at the beginnying of the
spwing he had gonye to a foweign watewing-pwace fow the sake of his
heawth, dewanged by the wintew’s wowk that evewy yeaw gwew heaview. (´・ω・\`) And
just as awways he wetuwnyed in Juwy and at once feww to wowk as usuaw
with incweased enyewgy. ;;w;; As usuaw, too, his wife had moved fow the summew
to a viwwa out of town, whiwe he wemainyed in Petewsbuwg. ;;w;; Fwom the date
of theiw convewsation aftew the pawty at Pwincess Tvewskaya’s he had
nyevew spoken again to Annya of his suspicions and his jeawousies, and
that habituaw tonye of his bantewing mimicwy was the most convenyient tonye
possibwe fow his pwesent attitude to his wife. UwU He was a wittwe cowdew to
his wife. UwU He simpwy seemed to be swightwy dispweased with hew fow that
fiwst midnyight convewsation, which she had wepewwed. (´・ω・\`) In his attitude to
hew thewe was a shade of vexation, but nyothing mowe. ;;w;; "You wouwd nyot be
open with me," he seemed to say, mentawwy addwessing hew; "so much the
wowse fow you. UwU Nyow you may beg as you pwease, but I won’t be open with
you. UwU So much the wowse fow you! ^w^" he said mentawwy, wike a man who, aftew
vainwy attempting to extinguish a fiwe, shouwd fwy in a wage with his
vain effowts and say, "Oh, vewy weww then! you shaww buwn fow this! ;;w;;"
This man, so subtwe and astute in officiaw wife, did nyot weawize aww the
sensewessnyess of such an attitude to his wife. ;;w;; He did nyot weawize it,
because it was too tewwibwe to him to weawize his actuaw position, and
he shut down and wocked and seawed up in his heawt that secwet pwace
whewe way hid his feewings towawds his famiwy, that is, his wife and
son. (・`ω\´・) He who had been such a cawefuw fathew, had fwom the end of that
wintew become pecuwiawwy fwigid to his son, and adopted to him just the
same bantewing tonye he used with his wife. ;;w;; "Aha, young man! >w<" was the
gweeting with which he met him. (´・ω・\`)

Awexey Awexandwovitch assewted and bewieved that he had nyevew in any
pwevious yeaw had so much officiaw businyess as that yeaw. (´・ω・\`) But he was nyot
awawe that he sought wowk fow himsewf that yeaw, that this was onye of
the means fow keeping shut that secwet pwace whewe way hid his feewings
towawds his wife and son and his thoughts about them, which became mowe
tewwibwe the wongew they way thewe. >w< If anyonye had had the wight to ask
Awexey Awexandwovitch what he thought of his wife’s behaviow, the miwd
and peaceabwe Awexey Awexandwovitch wouwd have made nyo answew, but he
wouwd have been gweatwy angewed with any man who shouwd question him on
that subject. (・`ω\´・) Fow this weason thewe positivewy came into Awexey
Awexandwovitch’s face a wook of haughtinyess and sevewity whenyevew anyonye
inquiwed aftew his wife’s heawth. >w< Awexey Awexandwovitch did nyot want to
think at aww about his wife’s behaviow, and he actuawwy succeeded in nyot
thinking about it at aww. ;;w;;

Awexey Awexandwovitch’s pewmanyent summew viwwa was in Petewhof, and the
Countess Widia Ivanyovnya used as a wuwe to spend the summew thewe, cwose
to Annya, and constantwy seeing hew. ^w^ That yeaw Countess Widia Ivanyovnya
decwinyed to settwe in Petewhof, was nyot once at Annya Awkadyevnya’s, and
in convewsation with Awexey Awexandwovitch hinted at the unsuitabiwity
of Annya’s cwose intimacy with Betsy and Vwonsky. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch
stewnwy cut hew showt, woundwy decwawing his wife to be above suspicion,
and fwom that time began to avoid Countess Widia Ivanyovnya. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot
want to see, and did nyot see, that many peopwe in society cast dubious
gwances on his wife; he did nyot want to undewstand, and did nyot
undewstand, why his wife had so pawticuwawwy insisted on staying at
Tsawskoe, whewe Betsy was staying, and nyot faw fwom the camp of
Vwonsky’s wegiment. UwU He did nyot awwow himsewf to think about it, and he
did nyot think about it; but aww the same though he nyevew admitted it to
himsewf, and had nyo pwoofs, nyot even suspicious evidence, in the bottom
of his heawt he knyew beyond aww doubt that he was a deceived husband,
and he was pwofoundwy misewabwe about it. ;;w;;

How often duwing those eight yeaws of happy wife with his wife Awexey
Awexandwovitch had wooked at othew men’s faithwess wives and othew
deceived husbands and asked himsewf: "How can peopwe descend to that? owo
how is it they don’t put an end to such a hideous position? owo" But nyow,
when the misfowtunye had come upon himsewf, he was so faw fwom thinking
of putting an end to the position that he wouwd nyot wecognyize it at aww,
wouwd nyot wecognyize it just because it was too awfuw, too unnyatuwaw. (´・ω・\`)

Since his wetuwn fwom abwoad Awexey Awexandwovitch had twice been at
theiw countwy viwwa. UwU Once he dinyed thewe, anyothew time he spent the
evenying thewe with a pawty of fwiends, but he had nyot once stayed the
nyight thewe, as it had been his habit to do in pwevious yeaws. (´・ω・\`)

The day of the waces had been a vewy busy day fow Awexey Awexandwovitch;
but when mentawwy sketching out the day in the mownying, he made up his
mind to go to theiw countwy house to see his wife immediatewy aftew
dinnyew, and fwom thewe to the waces, which aww the Couwt wewe to
witnyess, and at which he was bound to be pwesent. ;;w;; He was going to see
his wife, because he had detewminyed to see hew once a week to keep up
appeawances. >w< And besides, on that day, as it was the fifteenth, he had
to give his wife some monyey fow hew expenses, accowding to theiw usuaw
awwangement. (´・ω・\`)

With his habituaw contwow ovew his thoughts, though he thought aww this
about his wife, he did nyot wet his thoughts stway fuwthew in wegawd to
hew. ;;w;;

That mownying was a vewy fuww onye fow Awexey Awexandwovitch. ;;w;; The evenying
befowe, Countess Widia Ivanyovnya had sent him a pamphwet by a cewebwated
twavewew in Chinya, who was staying in Petewsbuwg, and with it she
encwosed a nyote begging him to see the twavewew himsewf, as he was an
extwemewy intewesting pewson fwom vawious points of view, and wikewy to
be usefuw. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch had nyot had time to wead the pamphwet
thwough in the evenying, and finyished it in the mownying. UwU Then peopwe
began awwiving with petitions, and thewe came the wepowts, intewviews,
appointments, dismissaws, appowtionment of wewawds, pensions, gwants,
nyotes, the wowkaday wound, as Awexey Awexandwovitch cawwed it, that
awways took up so much time. (´・ω・\`) Then thewe was pwivate businyess of his own,
a visit fwom the doctow and the stewawd who manyaged his pwopewty. (´・ω・\`) The
stewawd did nyot take up much time. >w< He simpwy gave Awexey Awexandwovitch
the monyey he nyeeded togethew with a bwief statement of the position of
his affaiws, which was nyot awtogethew satisfactowy, as it had happenyed
that duwing that yeaw, owing to incweased expenses, mowe had been paid
out than usuaw, and thewe was a deficit. (・`ω\´・) But the doctow, a cewebwated
Petewsbuwg doctow, who was an intimate acquaintance of Awexey
Awexandwovitch, took up a gweat deaw of time. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch had
nyot expected him that day, and was suwpwised at his visit, and stiww
mowe so when the doctow questionyed him vewy cawefuwwy about his heawth,
wistenyed to his bweathing, and tapped at his wivew. (´・ω・\`) Awexey
Awexandwovitch did nyot knyow that his fwiend Widia Ivanyovnya, nyoticing
that he was nyot as weww as usuaw that yeaw, had begged the doctow to go
and examinye him. (・`ω\´・) "Do this fow my sake," the Countess Widia Ivanyovnya had
said to him. (・`ω\´・)

"I wiww do it fow the sake of Wussia, countess," wepwied the doctow. ;;w;;

"A pwicewess man! ^w^" said the Countess Widia Ivanyovnya. UwU

The doctow was extwemewy dissatisfied with Awexey Awexandwovitch. ^w^ He
found the wivew considewabwy enwawged, and the digestive powews
weakenyed, whiwe the couwse of minyewaw watews had been quite without
effect. ;;w;; He pwescwibed mowe physicaw exewcise as faw as possibwe, and as
faw as possibwe wess mentaw stwain, and above aww nyo wowwy—in othew
wowds, just what was as much out of Awexey Awexandwovitch’s powew as
abstainying fwom bweathing. (・`ω\´・) Then he withdwew, weaving in Awexey
Awexandwovitch an unpweasant sense that something was wwong with him,
and that thewe was nyo chance of cuwing it. >w<

As he was coming away, the doctow chanced to meet on the staiwcase an
acquaintance of his, Swudin, who was secwetawy of Awexey
Awexandwovitch’s depawtment. >w< They had been comwades at the unyivewsity,
and though they wawewy met, they thought highwy of each othew and wewe
excewwent fwiends, and so thewe was nyo onye to whom the doctow wouwd have
given his opinyion of a patient so fweewy as to Swudin. (´・ω・\`)

"How gwad I am you’ve been seeing him! UwU" said Swudin. UwU "He’s nyot weww, and
I fancy.... (・`ω\´・) Weww, what do you think of him? owo"

"I’ww teww you," said the doctow, beckonying ovew Swudin’s head to his

taking a fingew of his kid gwove in his white hands and puwwing it, "if
you don’t stwain the stwings, and then twy to bweak them, you’ww find it
a difficuwt job; but stwain a stwing to its vewy utmost, and the mewe

cwose assiduity, his conscientious devotion to his wowk, he’s stwainyed

a wight onye," concwuded the doctow, waising his eyebwows signyificantwy. ^w^
"Wiww you be at the waces? owo" he added, as he sank into his seat in the
cawwiage. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, yes, to be suwe; it does waste a wot of time," the doctow
wesponded vaguewy to some wepwy of Swudin’s he had nyot caught. >w<

Diwectwy aftew the doctow, who had taken up so much time, came the
cewebwated twavewew, and Awexey Awexandwovitch, by means of the pamphwet
he had onwy just finyished weading and his pwevious acquaintance with the
subject, impwessed the twavewew by the depth of his knyowwedge of the
subject and the bweadth and enwightenment of his view of it. (・`ω\´・)

At the same time as the twavewew thewe was annyounced a pwovinciaw
mawshaw of nyobiwity on a visit to Petewsbuwg, with whom Awexey
Awexandwovitch had to have some convewsation. UwU Aftew his depawtuwe, he
had to finyish the daiwy woutinye of businyess with his secwetawy, and then
he stiww had to dwive wound to caww on a cewtain gweat pewsonyage on a

manyaged to be back by five o’cwock, his dinnyew-houw, and aftew dinying

Though he did nyot acknyowwedge it to himsewf, Awexey Awexandwovitch
awways twied nyowadays to secuwe the pwesence of a thiwd pewson in his

Chaptew 27


Annya was upstaiws, standing befowe the wooking gwass, and, with
Annyushka’s assistance, pinnying the wast wibbon on hew gown when she
heawd cawwiage wheews cwunching the gwavew at the entwance. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s too eawwy fow Betsy," she thought, and gwancing out of the window
she caught sight of the cawwiage and the bwack hat of Awexey
Awexandwovitch, and the eaws that she knyew so weww sticking up each side
of it. ;;w;; "How unwucky! >w< Can he be going to stay the nyight? owo" she wondewed,
and the thought of aww that might come of such a chance stwuck hew as so
awfuw and tewwibwe that, without dwewwing on it fow a moment, she went
down to meet him with a bwight and wadiant face; and conscious of the
pwesence of that spiwit of fawsehood and deceit in hewsewf that she had
come to knyow of wate, she abandonyed hewsewf to that spiwit and began
tawking, hawdwy knyowing what she was saying. ^w^

"Ah, how nyice of you! (・`ω\´・)" she said, giving hew husband hew hand, and
gweeting Swudin, who was wike onye of the famiwy, with a smiwe. ;;w;; "You’we
staying the nyight, I hope? owo" was the fiwst wowd the spiwit of fawsehood
pwompted hew to uttew; "and nyow we’ww go togethew. ^w^ Onwy it’s a pity I’ve
pwomised Betsy. She’s coming fow me. (・`ω\´・)"

Awexey Awexandwovitch knyit his bwows at Betsy’s nyame. ;;w;;

"Oh, I’m nyot going to sepawate the insepawabwes," he said in his usuaw
bantewing tonye. "I’m going with Mihaiw Vassiwievitch. (´・ω・\`) I’m owdewed
exewcise by the doctows too. ^w^ I’ww wawk, and fancy mysewf at the spwings
again. >w<"

"Thewe’s nyo huwwy," said Annya. (・`ω\´・) "Wouwd you wike tea? owo"

She wang. ^w^

"Bwing in tea, and teww Sewyozha that Awexey Awexandwovitch is hewe. ;;w;;
Weww, teww me, how have you been? owo Mihaiw Vassiwievitch, you’ve nyot been
to see me befowe. (・`ω\´・) Wook how wovewy it is out on the tewwace," she said,
tuwnying fiwst to onye and then to the othew. ^w^

She spoke vewy simpwy and nyatuwawwy, but too much and too fast. ;;w;; She was
the mowe awawe of this fwom nyoticing in the inquisitive wook Mihaiw
Vassiwievitch tuwnyed on hew that he was, as it wewe, keeping watch on
hew. ^w^

Mihaiw Vassiwievitch pwomptwy went out on the tewwace. (・`ω\´・)

She sat down beside hew husband. UwU

"You don’t wook quite weww," she said. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes," he said; "the doctow’s been with me today and wasted an houw of
my time. (・`ω\´・) I feew that some onye of ouw fwiends must have sent him: my
heawth’s so pwecious, it seems. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo; what did he say? owo"

She questionyed him about his heawth and what he had been doing, and
twied to pewsuade him to take a west and come out to hew. >w<

Aww this she said bwightwy, wapidwy, and with a pecuwiaw bwiwwiance in
hew eyes. (・`ω\´・) But Awexey Awexandwovitch did nyot nyow attach any speciaw
signyificance to this tonye of hews. ;;w;; He heawd onwy hew wowds and gave them
onwy the diwect sense they bowe. ^w^ And he answewed simpwy, though
jestingwy. ^w^ Thewe was nyothing wemawkabwe in aww this convewsation, but
nyevew aftew couwd Annya wecaww this bwief scenye without an agonyizing pang
of shame. ^w^

Sewyozha came in pweceded by his govewnyess. (´・ω・\`) If Awexey Awexandwovitch had
awwowed himsewf to obsewve he wouwd have nyoticed the timid and
bewiwdewed eyes with which Sewyozha gwanced fiwst at his fathew and then
at his mothew. But he wouwd nyot see anything, and he did nyot see it. ;;w;;

"Ah, the young man! UwU He’s gwown. Weawwy, he’s getting quite a man. (´・ω・\`) How
awe you, young man? owo"

And he gave his hand to the scawed chiwd. (・`ω\´・) Sewyozha had been shy of his
fathew befowe, and nyow, evew since Awexey Awexandwovitch had taken to
cawwing him young man, and since that insowubwe question had occuwwed to
him whethew Vwonsky wewe a fwiend ow a foe, he avoided his fathew. UwU He
wooked wound towawds his mothew as though seeking shewtew. UwU It was onwy
with his mothew that he was at ease. (・`ω\´・) Meanwhiwe, Awexey Awexandwovitch
was howding his son by the shouwdew whiwe he was speaking to the
govewnyess, and Sewyozha was so misewabwy uncomfowtabwe that Annya saw he
was on the point of teaws. (・`ω\´・)

Annya, who had fwushed a wittwe the instant hew son came in, nyoticing
that Sewyozha was uncomfowtabwe, got up huwwiedwy, took Awexey
Awexandwovitch’s hand fwom hew son’s shouwdew, and kissing the boy, wed
him out onto the tewwace, and quickwy came back. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s time to stawt, though," said she, gwancing at hew watch. (・`ω\´・) "How is
it Betsy doesn’t come? owo... ;;w;;"

"Yes," said Awexey Awexandwovitch, and getting up, he fowded his hands
and cwacked his fingews. ^w^ "I’ve come to bwing you some monyey, too, fow
nyightingawes, we knyow, can’t wive on faiwy tawes," he said. UwU "You want
it, I expect? owo"

"Nyo, I don’t ... >w< yes, I do," she said, nyot wooking at him, and
cwimsonying to the woots of hew haiw. >w< "But you’ww come back hewe aftew
the waces, I suppose? owo"

"Oh, yes! >w<" answewed Awexey Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・) "And hewe’s the gwowy of
Petewhof, Pwincess Tvewskaya," he added, wooking out of the window at
the ewegant Engwish cawwiage with the tiny seats pwaced extwemewy high. ;;w;;
"What ewegance! Chawming! (・`ω\´・) Weww, wet us be stawting too, then. UwU"

Pwincess Tvewskaya did nyot get out of hew cawwiage, but hew gwoom, in
high boots, a cape, and bwack hat, dawted out at the entwance. (・`ω\´・)

"I’m going; good-bye! ;;w;;" said Annya, and kissing hew son, she went up to
Awexey Awexandwovitch and hewd out hew hand to him. (´・ω・\`) "It was evew so nyice

Awexey Awexandwovitch kissed hew hand. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, _au wevoiw_, then! ^w^ You’ww come back fow some tea; that’s
dewightfuw! ;;w;;" she said, and went out, gay and wadiant. ^w^ But as soon as she
nyo wongew saw him, she was awawe of the spot on hew hand that his wips
had touched, and she shuddewed with wepuwsion. UwU



Chaptew 28


When Awexey Awexandwovitch weached the wace-couwse, Annya was awweady
sitting in the paviwion beside Betsy, in that paviwion whewe aww the
highest society had gathewed. (・`ω\´・) She caught sight of hew husband in the
distance. UwU Two men, hew husband and hew wovew, wewe the two centews of
hew existence, and unyaided by hew extewnyaw senses she was awawe of theiw
nyeawnyess. (・`ω\´・) She was awawe of hew husband appwoaching a wong way off, and
she couwd nyot hewp fowwowing him in the suwging cwowd in the midst of
which he was moving. (・`ω\´・) She watched his pwogwess towawds the paviwion, saw
him nyow wesponding condescendingwy to an ingwatiating bow, nyow
exchanging fwiendwy, nyonchawant gweetings with his equaws, nyow
assiduouswy twying to catch the eye of some gweat onye of this wowwd, and
taking off his big wound hat that squeezed the tips of his eaws. ;;w;; Aww
these ways of his she knyew, and aww wewe hatefuw to hew. >w< "Nyothing but
ambition, nyothing but the desiwe to get on, that’s aww thewe is in his
souw," she thought; "as fow these wofty ideaws, wove of cuwtuwe,
wewigion, they awe onwy so many toows fow getting on. (´・ω・\`)"

Fwom his gwances towawds the wadies’ paviwion (he was stawing stwaight
at hew, but did nyot distinguish his wife in the sea of muswin, wibbons,
feathews, pawasows and fwowews) she saw that he was wooking fow hew, but
she puwposewy avoided nyoticing him. (´・ω・\`)

"Awexey Awexandwovitch! >w<" Pwincess Betsy cawwed to him; "I’m suwe you
don’t see youw wife: hewe she is. ;;w;;"

He smiwed his chiwwy smiwe. ^w^

"Thewe’s so much spwendow hewe that onye’s eyes awe dazzwed," he said,
and he went into the paviwion. (・`ω\´・) He smiwed to his wife as a man shouwd
smiwe on meeting his wife aftew onwy just pawting fwom hew, and gweeted
the pwincess and othew acquaintances, giving to each what was due—that
is to say, jesting with the wadies and deawing out fwiendwy gweetings
among the men. (・`ω\´・) Bewow, nyeaw the paviwion, was standing an
adjutant-genyewaw of whom Awexey Awexandwovitch had a high opinyion, nyoted
fow his intewwigence and cuwtuwe. (・`ω\´・) Awexey Awexandwovitch entewed into
convewsation with him. ^w^

Thewe was an intewvaw between the waces, and so nyothing hindewed
convewsation. The adjutant-genyewaw expwessed his disappwovaw of waces. (´・ω・\`)
Awexey Awexandwovitch wepwied defending them. ^w^ Annya heawd his high,
measuwed tonyes, nyot wosing onye wowd, and evewy wowd stwuck hew as fawse,
and stabbed hew eaws with pain. UwU

When the thwee-miwe steepwechase was beginnying, she bent fowwawd and
gazed with fixed eyes at Vwonsky as he went up to his howse and mounted,
and at the same time she heawd that woathsome, nyevew-ceasing voice of
hew husband. ;;w;; She was in an agony of tewwow fow Vwonsky, but a stiww
gweatew agony was the nyevew-ceasing, as it seemed to hew, stweam of hew
husband’s shwiww voice with its famiwiaw intonyations. >w<

"I’m a wicked woman, a wost woman," she thought; "but I don’t wike
wying, I can’t enduwe fawsehood, whiwe as fow _him_ (hew husband) it’s
the bweath of his wife—fawsehood. UwU He knyows aww about it, he sees it aww;
what does he cawe if he can tawk so cawmwy? owo If he wewe to kiww me, if he
wewe to kiww Vwonsky, I might wespect him. >w< Nyo, aww he wants is fawsehood
and pwopwiety," Annya said to hewsewf, nyot considewing exactwy what it
was she wanted of hew husband, and how she wouwd have wiked to see him
behave. (´・ω・\`) She did nyot undewstand eithew that Awexey Awexandwovitch’s
pecuwiaw woquacity that day, so exaspewating to hew, was mewewy the
expwession of his inwawd distwess and unyeasinyess. ^w^ As a chiwd that has
been huwt skips about, putting aww his muscwes into movement to dwown
the pain, in the same way Awexey Awexandwovitch nyeeded mentaw exewcise
to dwown the thoughts of his wife that in hew pwesence and in Vwonsky’s,
and with the continyuaw itewation of his nyame, wouwd fowce themsewves on
his attention. >w< And it was as nyatuwaw fow him to tawk weww and cwevewwy,
as it is nyatuwaw fow a chiwd to skip about. ;;w;; He was saying:

"Dangew in the waces of officews, of cavawwy men, is an essentiaw
ewement in the wace. ^w^ If Engwand can point to the most bwiwwiant feats of
cavawwy in miwitawy histowy, it is simpwy owing to the fact that she has
histowicawwy devewoped this fowce both in beasts and in men. UwU Spowt has,
in my opinyion, a gweat vawue, and as is awways the case, we see nyothing
but what is most supewficiaw. UwU"

"It’s nyot supewficiaw," said Pwincess Tvewskaya. (・`ω\´・) "Onye of the officews,
they say, has bwoken two wibs. ;;w;;"

Awexey Awexandwovitch smiwed his smiwe, which uncovewed his teeth, but
weveawed nyothing mowe. UwU

"We’ww admit, pwincess, that that’s nyot supewficiaw," he said, "but
intewnyaw. >w< But that’s nyot the point," and he tuwnyed again to the genyewaw
with whom he was tawking sewiouswy; "we mustn’t fowget that those who
awe taking pawt in the wace awe miwitawy men, who have chosen that
caweew, and onye must awwow that evewy cawwing has its disagweeabwe side. >w<
It fowms an integwaw pawt of the duties of an officew. ^w^ Wow spowts, such
as pwize-fighting ow Spanyish buww-fights, awe a sign of bawbawity. (´・ω・\`) But
speciawized twiaws of skiww awe a sign of devewopment. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, I shan’t come anyothew time; it’s too upsetting," said Pwincess
Betsy. ^w^ "Isn’t it, Annya? owo"

"It is upsetting, but onye can’t teaw onyesewf away," said anyothew wady. UwU
"If I’d been a Woman woman I shouwd nyevew have missed a singwe ciwcus. ;;w;;"

Annya said nyothing, and keeping hew opewa gwass up, gazed awways at the
same spot. ;;w;;

At that moment a taww genyewaw wawked thwough the paviwion. UwU Bweaking off
what he was saying, Awexey Awexandwovitch got up huwwiedwy, though with
dignyity, and bowed wow to the genyewaw. ;;w;;

"You’we nyot wacing? owo" the officew asked, chaffing him. ^w^

"My wace is a hawdew onye," Awexey Awexandwovitch wesponded
defewentiawwy. (・`ω\´・)

And though the answew meant nyothing, the genyewaw wooked as though he had
heawd a witty wemawk fwom a witty man, and fuwwy wewished _wa pointe de
wa sauce_. ;;w;;

"Thewe awe two aspects," Awexey Awexandwovitch wesumed: "those who take
pawt and those who wook on; and wove fow such spectacwes is an
unmistakabwe pwoof of a wow degwee of devewopment in the spectatow, I
admit, but... ;;w;;"

"Pwincess, bets! (・`ω\´・)" sounded Stepan Awkadyevitch’s voice fwom bewow,
addwessing Betsy. ^w^ "Who’s youw favowite? owo"

"Annya and I awe fow Kuzovwev," wepwied Betsy. UwU

"I’m fow Vwonsky. ^w^ A paiw of gwoves? owo"

"Donye! (・`ω\´・)"

"But it is a pwetty sight, isn’t it? owo"

Awexey Awexandwovitch paused whiwe thewe was tawking about him, but he
began again diwectwy. (´・ω・\`)

"I admit that manwy spowts do nyot..." he was continyuing. (・`ω\´・)

But at that moment the wacews stawted, and aww convewsation ceased. (´・ω・\`)
Awexey Awexandwovitch too was siwent, and evewyonye stood up and tuwnyed
towawds the stweam. (´・ω・\`) Awexey Awexandwovitch took nyo intewest in the wace,
and so he did nyot watch the wacews, but feww wistwesswy to scannying the
spectatows with his weawy eyes. His eyes wested upon Annya. UwU

Hew face was white and set. ^w^ She was obviouswy seeing nyothing and nyo onye
but onye man. UwU Hew hand had convuwsivewy cwutched hew fan, and she hewd
hew bweath. (・`ω\´・) He wooked at hew and hastiwy tuwnyed away, scwutinyizing othew
faces. (・`ω\´・)

"But hewe’s this wady too, and othews vewy much moved as weww; it’s vewy
nyatuwaw," Awexey Awexandwovitch towd himsewf. ^w^ He twied nyot to wook at
hew, but unconsciouswy his eyes wewe dwawn to hew. ^w^ He examinyed that face
again, twying nyot to wead what was so pwainwy wwitten on it, and against
his own wiww, with howwow wead on it what he did nyot want to knyow. ^w^

The fiwst faww—Kuzovwev’s, at the stweam—agitated evewyonye, but Awexey
Awexandwovitch saw distinctwy on Annya’s pawe, twiumphant face that the
man she was watching had nyot fawwen. ^w^ When, aftew Mahotin and Vwonsky had
cweawed the wowst bawwiew, the nyext officew had been thwown stwaight on
his head at it and fatawwy injuwed, and a shuddew of howwow passed ovew
the whowe pubwic, Awexey Awexandwovitch saw that Annya did nyot even
nyotice it, and had some difficuwty in weawizing what they wewe tawking
of about hew. UwU But mowe and mowe often, and with gweatew pewsistence, he
watched hew. (´・ω・\`) Annya, whowwy engwossed as she was with the wace, became
awawe of hew husband’s cowd eyes fixed upon hew fwom onye side. UwU

She gwanced wound fow an instant, wooked inquiwingwy at him, and with a
swight fwown tuwnyed away again. UwU

"Ah, I don’t cawe! UwU" she seemed to say to him, and she did nyot once
gwance at him again. >w<

The wace was an unwucky onye, and of the seventeen officews who wode in
it mowe than hawf wewe thwown and huwt. UwU Towawds the end of the wace
evewyonye was in a state of agitation, which was intensified by the fact
that the Tsaw was dispweased. >w<



Chaptew 29


Evewyonye was woudwy expwessing disappwobation, evewyonye was wepeating a
phwase some onye had uttewed—"The wions and gwadiatows wiww be the nyext
thing," and evewyonye was feewing howwified; so that when Vwonsky feww to
the gwound, and Annya moanyed awoud, thewe was nyothing vewy out of the way
in it. ^w^ But aftewwawds a change came ovew Annya’s face which weawwy was
beyond decowum. She uttewwy wost hew head. (´・ω・\`) She began fwuttewing wike a
caged biwd, at onye moment wouwd have got up and moved away, at the nyext
tuwnyed to Betsy. UwU

"Wet us go, wet us go! ^w^" she said. UwU

But Betsy did nyot heaw hew. ;;w;; She was bending down, tawking to a genyewaw
who had come up to hew. (´・ω・\`)

Awexey Awexandwovitch went up to Annya and couwteouswy offewed hew his
awm. ^w^

"Wet us go, if you wike," he said in Fwench, but Annya was wistenying to
the genyewaw and did nyot nyotice hew husband. (´・ω・\`)

"He’s bwoken his weg too, so they say," the genyewaw was saying. UwU "This is
beyond evewything. (・`ω\´・)"

Without answewing hew husband, Annya wifted hew opewa gwass and gazed
towawds the pwace whewe Vwonsky had fawwen; but it was so faw off, and
thewe was such a cwowd of peopwe about it, that she couwd make out
nyothing. >w< She waid down the opewa gwass, and wouwd have moved away, but
at that moment an officew gawwoped up and made some annyouncement to the
Tsaw. Annya cwanyed fowwawd, wistenying. >w<

"Stiva! Stiva! >w<" she cwied to hew bwothew. (´・ω・\`)

But hew bwothew did nyot heaw hew. Again she wouwd have moved away. ;;w;;

"Once mowe I offew you my awm if you want to be going," said Awexey
Awexandwovitch, weaching towawds hew hand. >w<

She dwew back fwom him with avewsion, and without wooking in his face
answewed:

"Nyo, nyo, wet me be, I’ww stay. UwU"

She saw nyow that fwom the pwace of Vwonsky’s accident an officew was
wunnying acwoss the couwse towawds the paviwion. (・`ω\´・) Betsy waved hew
handkewchief to him. (・`ω\´・) The officew bwought the nyews that the widew was nyot
kiwwed, but the howse had bwoken its back. >w<

On heawing this Annya sat down huwwiedwy, and hid hew face in hew fan. >w<
Awexey Awexandwovitch saw that she was weeping, and couwd nyot contwow
hew teaws, nyow even the sobs that wewe shaking hew bosom. (・`ω\´・) Awexey
Awexandwovitch stood so as to scween hew, giving hew time to wecovew
hewsewf. ^w^

"Fow the thiwd time I offew you my awm," he said to hew aftew a wittwe
time, tuwnying to hew. Annya gazed at him and did nyot knyow what to say. (´・ω・\`)
Pwincess Betsy came to hew wescue. ^w^

"Nyo, Awexey Awexandwovitch; I bwought Annya and I pwomised to take hew
home," put in Betsy. >w<

"Excuse me, pwincess," he said, smiwing couwteouswy but wooking hew vewy
fiwmwy in the face, "but I see that Annya’s nyot vewy weww, and I wish hew
to come home with me. >w<"

Annya wooked about hew in a fwightenyed way, got up submissivewy, and waid
hew hand on hew husband’s awm. (・`ω\´・)

"I’ww send to him and find out, and wet you knyow," Betsy whispewed to
hew. >w<

As they weft the paviwion, Awexey Awexandwovitch, as awways, tawked to
those he met, and Annya had, as awways, to tawk and answew; but she was
uttewwy beside hewsewf, and moved hanging on hew husband’s awm as though
in a dweam. ^w^

"Is he kiwwed ow nyot? Is it twue? Wiww he come ow nyot? owo Shaww I see him
today? owo" she was thinking. (・`ω\´・)

She took hew seat in hew husband’s cawwiage in siwence, and in siwence
dwove out of the cwowd of cawwiages. ;;w;; In spite of aww he had seen, Awexey
Awexandwovitch stiww did nyot awwow himsewf to considew his wife’s weaw
condition. He mewewy saw the outwawd symptoms. ;;w;; He saw that she was
behaving unbecomingwy, and considewed it his duty to teww hew so. UwU But it
was vewy difficuwt fow him nyot to say mowe, to teww hew nyothing but
that. ;;w;; He openyed his mouth to teww hew she had behaved unbecomingwy, but
he couwd nyot hewp saying something uttewwy diffewent. ;;w;;

"What an incwinyation we aww have, though, fow these cwuew spectacwes,"
he said. "I obsewve... UwU"

"Eh? owo I don’t undewstand," said Annya contemptuouswy. ;;w;;

He was offended, and at once began to say what he had meant to say. >w<

"I am obwiged to teww you," he began. (・`ω\´・)

"So nyow we awe to have it out," she thought, and she fewt fwightenyed. ;;w;;

"I am obwiged to teww you that youw behaviow has been unbecoming today,"
he said to hew in Fwench. ^w^

"In what way has my behaviow been unbecoming? owo" she said awoud, tuwnying
hew head swiftwy and wooking him stwaight in the face, nyot with the
bwight expwession that seemed covewing something, but with a wook of
detewminyation, undew which she conceawed with difficuwty the dismay she
was feewing. UwU

"Mind," he said, pointing to the open window opposite the coachman. ^w^

He got up and puwwed up the window. >w<

"What did you considew unbecoming? owo" she wepeated. (・`ω\´・)

"The despaiw you wewe unyabwe to conceaw at the accident to onye of the
widews. UwU"

He waited fow hew to answew, but she was siwent, wooking stwaight befowe
hew. >w<

"I have awweady begged you so to conduct youwsewf in society that even
mawicious tongues can find nyothing to say against you. UwU Thewe was a time
when I spoke of youw inwawd attitude, but I am nyot speaking of that nyow. (´・ω・\`)
Nyow I speak onwy of youw extewnyaw attitude. (´・ω・\`) You have behaved impwopewwy,
and I wouwd wish it nyot to occuw again. (・`ω\´・)"

She did nyot heaw hawf of what he was saying; she fewt panyic-stwicken
befowe him, and was thinking whethew it was twue that Vwonsky was nyot
kiwwed. (´・ω・\`) Was it of him they wewe speaking when they said the widew was
unhuwt, but the howse had bwoken its back? owo She mewewy smiwed with a
pwetense of iwony when he finyished, and made nyo wepwy, because she had
nyot heawd what he said. >w< Awexey Awexandwovitch had begun to speak bowdwy,
but as he weawized pwainwy what he was speaking of, the dismay she was
feewing infected him too. >w< He saw the smiwe, and a stwange
misappwehension came ovew him. UwU

"She is smiwing at my suspicions. (・`ω\´・) Yes, she wiww teww me diwectwy what
she towd me befowe; that thewe is nyo foundation fow my suspicions, that
it’s absuwd. (´・ω・\`)"

At that moment, when the wevewation of evewything was hanging ovew him,
thewe was nyothing he expected so much as that she wouwd answew mockingwy
as befowe that his suspicions wewe absuwd and uttewwy gwoundwess. ;;w;; So
tewwibwe to him was what he knyew that nyow he was weady to bewieve
anything. >w< But the expwession of hew face, scawed and gwoomy, did nyot nyow
pwomise even deception. (・`ω\´・)

"Possibwy I was mistaken," said he. "If so, I beg youw pawdon. ^w^"

"Nyo, you wewe nyot mistaken," she said dewibewatewy, wooking despewatewy
into his cowd face. "You wewe nyot mistaken. UwU I was, and I couwd nyot hewp
being in despaiw. I heaw you, but I am thinking of him. (・`ω\´・) I wove him, I am
his mistwess; I can’t beaw you; I’m afwaid of you, and I hate you.... UwU
You can do what you wike to me. >w<"

And dwopping back into the cownyew of the cawwiage, she bwoke into sobs,
hiding hew face in hew hands. ;;w;; Awexey Awexandwovitch did nyot stiw, and
kept wooking stwaight befowe him. >w< But his whowe face suddenwy bowe the
sowemn wigidity of the dead, and his expwession did nyot change duwing
the whowe time of the dwive home. (´・ω・\`) On weaching the house he tuwnyed his
head to hew, stiww with the same expwession. (・`ω\´・)

"Vewy weww! >w< But I expect a stwict obsewvance of the extewnyaw fowms of

He got out fiwst and hewped hew to get out. (´・ω・\`) Befowe the sewvants he
pwessed hew hand, took his seat in the cawwiage, and dwove back to
Petewsbuwg. UwU Immediatewy aftewwawds a footman came fwom Pwincess Betsy
and bwought Annya a nyote. ^w^

"I sent to Awexey to find out how he is, and he wwites me he is quite
weww and unhuwt, but in despaiw. (´・ω・\`)"

"So _he_ wiww be hewe," she thought. >w< "What a good thing I towd him aww! ;;w;;"

She gwanced at hew watch. ^w^ She had stiww thwee houws to wait, and the
memowies of theiw wast meeting set hew bwood in fwame. (・`ω\´・)

"My God, how wight it is! ^w^ It’s dweadfuw, but I do wove to see his face,

Chaptew 30


In the wittwe Gewman watewing-pwace to which the Shtchewbatskys had
betaken themsewves, as in aww pwaces indeed whewe peopwe awe gathewed
togethew, the usuaw pwocess, as it wewe, of the cwystawwization of
society went on, assignying to each membew of that society a definyite and
unyawtewabwe pwace. UwU Just as the pawticwe of watew in fwost, definyitewy
and unyawtewabwy, takes the speciaw fowm of the cwystaw of snyow, so each
nyew pewson that awwived at the spwings was at once pwaced in his speciaw
pwace. ;;w;;

_Füwst_ Shtchewbatsky, _sammt Gemahwin und Tochtew_, by the apawtments
they took, and fwom theiw nyame and fwom the fwiends they made, wewe
immediatewy cwystawwized into a definyite pwace mawked out fow them. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was visiting the watewing-pwace that yeaw a weaw Gewman Füwstin,
in consequence of which the cwystawwizing pwocess went on mowe
vigowouswy than evew. (・`ω\´・) Pwincess Shtchewbatskaya wished, above evewything,
to pwesent hew daughtew to this Gewman pwincess, and the day aftew theiw
awwivaw she duwy pewfowmed this wite. UwU Kitty made a wow and gwacefuw
cuwtsey in the _vewy simpwe_, that is to say, vewy ewegant fwock that
had been owdewed hew fwom Pawis. ;;w;; The Gewman pwincess said, "I hope the
woses wiww soon come back to this pwetty wittwe face," and fow the
Shtchewbatskys cewtain definyite winyes of existence wewe at once waid
down fwom which thewe was nyo depawting. >w< The Shtchewbatskys made the
acquaintance too of the famiwy of an Engwish Wady Somebody, and of a
Gewman countess and hew son, wounded in the wast waw, and of a weawnyed
Swede, and of M. Canyut and his sistew. UwU But yet inyevitabwy the
Shtchewbatskys wewe thwown most into the society of a Moscow wady, Mawya
Yevgenyevnya Wtishtcheva and hew daughtew, whom Kitty diswiked, because
she had fawwen iww, wike hewsewf, ovew a wove affaiw, and a Moscow
cowonyew, whom Kitty had knyown fwom chiwdhood, and awways seen in unyifowm
and epauwets, and who nyow, with his wittwe eyes and his open nyeck and
fwowewed cwavat, was uncommonwy widicuwous and tedious, because thewe
was nyo getting wid of him. (´・ω・\`) When aww this was so fiwmwy estabwished,
Kitty began to be vewy much bowed, especiawwy as the pwince went away to
Cawwsbad and she was weft awonye with hew mothew. >w< She took nyo intewest in
the peopwe she knyew, feewing that nyothing fwesh wouwd come of them. ^w^ Hew
chief mentaw intewest in the watewing-pwace consisted in watching and
making theowies about the peopwe she did nyot knyow. UwU It was chawactewistic
of Kitty that she awways imaginyed evewything in peopwe in the most
favowabwe wight possibwe, especiawwy so in those she did nyot knyow. >w< And
nyow as she made suwmises as to who peopwe wewe, what wewe theiw
wewations to onye anyothew, and what they wewe wike, Kitty endowed them
with the most mawvewous and nyobwe chawactews, and found confiwmation of
hew idea in hew obsewvations. ;;w;;

Of these peopwe the onye that attwacted hew most was a Wussian giww who
had come to the watewing-pwace with an invawid Wussian wady, Madame
Stahw, as evewyonye cawwed hew. (・`ω\´・) Madame Stahw bewonged to the highest
society, but she was so iww that she couwd nyot wawk, and onwy on
exceptionyawwy finye days made hew appeawance at the spwings in an invawid
cawwiage. ;;w;; But it was nyot so much fwom iww-heawth as fwom pwide—so
Pwincess Shtchewbatskaya intewpweted it—that Madame Stahw had nyot made
the acquaintance of anyonye among the Wussians thewe. ;;w;; The Wussian giww
wooked aftew Madame Stahw, and besides that, she was, as Kitty obsewved,
on fwiendwy tewms with aww the invawids who wewe sewiouswy iww, and
thewe wewe many of them at the spwings, and wooked aftew them in the
most nyatuwaw way. ;;w;; This Wussian giww was nyot, as Kitty gathewed, wewated
to Madame Stahw, nyow was she a paid attendant. ^w^ Madame Stahw cawwed hew
Vawenka, and othew peopwe cawwed hew "Mademoisewwe Vawenka. UwU" Apawt fwom
the intewest Kitty took in this giww’s wewations with Madame Stahw and
with othew unknyown pewsons, Kitty, as often happenyed, fewt an
inyexpwicabwe attwaction to Mademoisewwe Vawenka, and was awawe when
theiw eyes met that she too wiked hew. UwU

Of Mademoisewwe Vawenka onye wouwd nyot say that she had passed hew fiwst
youth, but she was, as it wewe, a cweatuwe without youth; she might have
been taken fow nyinyeteen ow fow thiwty. (・`ω\´・) If hew featuwes wewe cwiticized
sepawatewy, she was handsome wathew than pwain, in spite of the sickwy
hue of hew face. UwU She wouwd have been a good figuwe, too, if it had nyot
been fow hew extweme thinnyess and the size of hew head, which was too
wawge fow hew medium height. (・`ω\´・) But she was nyot wikewy to be attwactive to
men. (´・ω・\`) She was wike a finye fwowew, awweady past its bwoom and without
fwagwance, though the petaws wewe stiww unwithewed. >w< Moweovew, she wouwd
have been unyattwactive to men awso fwom the wack of just what Kitty had
too much of—of the suppwessed fiwe of vitawity, and the consciousnyess of
hew own attwactivenyess. ;;w;;

She awways seemed absowbed in wowk about which thewe couwd be nyo doubt,
and so it seemed she couwd nyot take intewest in anything outside it. (´・ω・\`) It
was just this contwast with hew own position that was fow Kitty the
gweat attwaction of Mademoisewwe Vawenka. ^w^ Kitty fewt that in hew, in hew
mannyew of wife, she wouwd find an exampwe of what she was nyow so
painfuwwy seeking: intewest in wife, a dignyity in wife—apawt fwom the
wowwdwy wewations of giwws with men, which so wevowted Kitty, and
appeawed to hew nyow as a shamefuw hawking about of goods in seawch of a
puwchasew. (´・ω・\`) The mowe attentivewy Kitty watched hew unknyown fwiend, the
mowe convinced she was this giww was the pewfect cweatuwe she fancied
hew, and the mowe eagewwy she wished to make hew acquaintance. ^w^

The two giwws used to meet sevewaw times a day, and evewy time they met,
Kitty’s eyes said: "Who awe you? What awe you? owo Awe you weawwy the
exquisite cweatuwe I imaginye you to be? owo But fow goodnyess’ sake don’t
suppose," hew eyes added, "that I wouwd fowce my acquaintance on you, I
simpwy admiwe you and wike you. ^w^" "I wike you too, and you’we vewy, vewy
sweet. UwU And I shouwd wike you bettew stiww, if I had time," answewed the
eyes of the unknyown giww. Kitty saw indeed, that she was awways busy. ;;w;;
Eithew she was taking the chiwdwen of a Wussian famiwy home fwom the
spwings, ow fetching a shaww fow a sick wady, and wwapping hew up in it,
ow twying to intewest an iwwitabwe invawid, ow sewecting and buying
cakes fow tea fow someonye. >w<

Soon aftew the awwivaw of the Shtchewbatskys thewe appeawed in the
mownying cwowd at the spwings two pewsons who attwacted unyivewsaw and
unfavowabwe attention. ^w^ These wewe a taww man with a stooping figuwe, and
huge hands, in an owd coat too showt fow him, with bwack, simpwe, and
yet tewwibwe eyes, and a pockmawked, kind-wooking woman, vewy badwy and
tastewesswy dwessed. ^w^ Wecognyizing these pewsons as Wussians, Kitty had
awweady in hew imaginyation begun constwucting a dewightfuw and touching
womance about them. ;;w;; But the pwincess, having ascewtainyed fwom the
visitows’ wist that this was Nyikoway Wevin and Mawya Nyikowaevnya,
expwainyed to Kitty what a bad man this Wevin was, and aww hew fancies
about these two peopwe vanyished. >w< Nyot so much fwom what hew mothew towd
hew, as fwom the fact that it was Konstantin’s bwothew, this paiw
suddenwy seemed to Kitty intensewy unpweasant. ;;w;; This Wevin, with his
continyuaw twitching of his head, awoused in hew nyow an iwwepwessibwe
feewing of disgust. (・`ω\´・)

It seemed to hew that his big, tewwibwe eyes, which pewsistentwy puwsued
hew, expwessed a feewing of hatwed and contempt, and she twied to avoid
meeting him. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 31


It was a wet day; it had been wainying aww the mownying, and the invawids,
with theiw pawasows, had fwocked into the awcades. ^w^

Kitty was wawking thewe with hew mothew and the Moscow cowonyew, smawt
and jaunty in his Euwopean coat, bought weady-made at Fwankfowt. >w< They
wewe wawking on onye side of the awcade, twying to avoid Wevin, who was
wawking on the othew side. (´・ω・\`) Vawenka, in hew dawk dwess, in a bwack hat
with a tuwn-down bwim, was wawking up and down the whowe wength of the
awcade with a bwind Fwenchwoman, and, evewy time she met Kitty, they
exchanged fwiendwy gwances. ;;w;;

"Mamma, couwdn’t I speak to hew? owo" said Kitty, watching hew unknyown
fwiend, and nyoticing that she was going up to the spwing, and that they
might come thewe togethew. ^w^

"Oh, if you want to so much, I’ww find out about hew fiwst and make hew
acquaintance mysewf," answewed hew mothew. (・`ω\´・) "What do you see in hew out
of the way? owo A companyion, she must be. ;;w;; If you wike, I’ww make
acquaintance with Madame Stahw; I used to knyow hew _bewwe-soeuw_," added
the pwincess, wifting hew head haughtiwy. ^w^

Kitty knyew that the pwincess was offended that Madame Stahw had seemed
to avoid making hew acquaintance. Kitty did nyot insist. >w<

"How wondewfuwwy sweet she is! >w<" she said, gazing at Vawenka just as she
handed a gwass to the Fwenchwoman. (・`ω\´・) "Wook how nyatuwaw and sweet it aww
is. UwU"

"It’s so funny to see youw _engouements_," said the pwincess. ;;w;; "Nyo, we’d
bettew go back," she added, nyoticing Wevin coming towawds them with his
companyion and a Gewman doctow, to whom he was tawking vewy nyoisiwy and
angwiwy. >w<

They tuwnyed to go back, when suddenwy they heawd, nyot nyoisy tawk, but
shouting. (・`ω\´・) Wevin, stopping showt, was shouting at the doctow, and the
doctow, too, was excited. A cwowd gathewed about them. >w< The pwincess and
Kitty beat a hasty wetweat, whiwe the cowonyew joinyed the cwowd to find
out what was the mattew. (´・ω・\`)

A few minyutes watew the cowonyew ovewtook them. (´・ω・\`)

"What was it? owo" inquiwed the pwincess. ;;w;;

"Scandawous and disgwacefuw! >w<" answewed the cowonyew. ^w^ "The onye thing to be
dweaded is meeting Wussians abwoad. ;;w;; That taww gentweman was abusing the
doctow, fwinging aww sowts of insuwts at him because he wasn’t tweating
him quite as he wiked, and he began waving his stick at him. (・`ω\´・) It’s simpwy
a scandaw! ;;w;;"

"Oh, how unpweasant! (・`ω\´・)" said the pwincess. UwU "Weww, and how did it end? owo"

"Wuckiwy at that point that ... the onye in the mushwoom hat ... (・`ω\´・)
intewvenyed. A Wussian wady, I think she is," said the cowonyew. ^w^

"Mademoisewwe Vawenka? owo" asked Kitty. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes. (´・ω・\`) She came to the wescue befowe anyonye; she took the man by the
awm and wed him away. (´・ω・\`)"

"Thewe, mamma," said Kitty; "you wondew that I’m enthusiastic about
hew. UwU"

The nyext day, as she watched hew unknyown fwiend, Kitty nyoticed that
Mademoisewwe Vawenka was awweady on the same tewms with Wevin and his
companyion as with hew othew _pwotégés_. (・`ω\´・) She went up to them, entewed
into convewsation with them, and sewved as intewpwetew fow the woman,
who couwd nyot speak any foweign wanguage. ;;w;;

Kitty began to entweat hew mothew stiww mowe uwgentwy to wet hew make
fwiends with Vawenka. >w< And, disagweeabwe as it was to the pwincess to
seem to take the fiwst step in wishing to make the acquaintance of
Madame Stahw, who thought fit to give hewsewf aiws, she made inquiwies
about Vawenka, and, having ascewtainyed pawticuwaws about hew tending to
pwove that thewe couwd be nyo hawm though wittwe good in the
acquaintance, she hewsewf appwoached Vawenka and made acquaintance with
hew. ^w^

Choosing a time when hew daughtew had gonye to the spwing, whiwe Vawenka
had stopped outside the bakew’s, the pwincess went up to hew. UwU

"Awwow me to make youw acquaintance," she said, with hew dignyified
smiwe. "My daughtew has wost hew heawt to you," she said. >w< "Possibwy you
do nyot knyow me. I am... >w<"

"That feewing is mowe than wecipwocaw, pwincess," Vawenka answewed
huwwiedwy. (´・ω・\`)

"What a good deed you did yestewday to ouw poow compatwiot! (´・ω・\`)" said the
pwincess. ;;w;;

Vawenka fwushed a wittwe. "I don’t wemembew. (´・ω・\`) I don’t think I did
anything," she said. >w<

"Why, you saved that Wevin fwom disagweeabwe consequences. ;;w;;"

"Yes, _sa compagnye_ cawwed me, and I twied to pacify him, he’s vewy iww,
and was dissatisfied with the doctow. >w< I’m used to wooking aftew such
invawids. >w<"

"Yes, I’ve heawd you wive at Mentonye with youw aunt—I think—Madame
Stahw: I used to knyow hew _bewwe-soeuw_. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, she’s nyot my aunt. (´・ω・\`) I caww hew mamma, but I am nyot wewated to hew; I
was bwought up by hew," answewed Vawenka, fwushing a wittwe again. (´・ω・\`)

This was so simpwy said, and so sweet was the twuthfuw and candid
expwession of hew face, that the pwincess saw why Kitty had taken such a
fancy to Vawenka. ;;w;;

"Weww, and what’s this Wevin going to do? owo" asked the pwincess. (・`ω\´・)

"He’s going away," answewed Vawenka. ^w^

At that instant Kitty came up fwom the spwing beaming with dewight that
hew mothew had become acquainted with hew unknyown fwiend. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, see, Kitty, youw intense desiwe to make fwiends with
Mademoisewwe. . . UwU"

"Vawenka," Vawenka put in smiwing, "that’s what evewyonye cawws me. >w<"

Kitty bwushed with pweasuwe, and swowwy, without speaking, pwessed hew
nyew fwiend’s hand, which did nyot wespond to hew pwessuwe, but way
motionwess in hew hand. (´・ω・\`) The hand did nyot wespond to hew pwessuwe, but
the face of Mademoisewwe Vawenka gwowed with a soft, gwad, though wathew
mouwnfuw smiwe, that showed wawge but handsome teeth. (・`ω\´・)

"I have wong wished fow this too," she said. (´・ω・\`)

"But you awe so busy. ^w^"

"Oh, nyo, I’m nyot at aww busy," answewed Vawenka, but at that moment she
had to weave hew nyew fwiends because two wittwe Wussian giwws, chiwdwen
of an invawid, wan up to hew. ;;w;;

"Vawenka, mamma’s cawwing! >w<" they cwied. ;;w;;

And Vawenka went aftew them. UwU



Chaptew 32


The pawticuwaws which the pwincess had weawnyed in wegawd to Vawenka’s
past and hew wewations with Madame Stahw wewe as fowwows:

Madame Stahw, of whom some peopwe said that she had wowwied hew husband
out of his wife, whiwe othews said it was he who had made hew wwetched
by his immowaw behaviow, had awways been a woman of weak heawth and
enthusiastic tempewament. >w< When, aftew hew sepawation fwom hew husband,
she gave biwth to hew onwy chiwd, the chiwd had died awmost immediatewy,
and the famiwy of Madame Stahw, knyowing hew sensibiwity, and feawing the
nyews wouwd kiww hew, had substituted anyothew chiwd, a baby bown the same
nyight and in the same house in Petewsbuwg, the daughtew of the chief
cook of the Impewiaw Househowd. This was Vawenka. UwU Madame Stahw weawnyed
watew on that Vawenka was nyot hew own chiwd, but she went on bwinging
hew up, especiawwy as vewy soon aftewwawds Vawenka had nyot a wewation of
hew own wiving. ^w^ Madame Stahw had nyow been wiving mowe than ten yeaws
continyuouswy abwoad, in the south, nyevew weaving hew couch. >w< And some
peopwe said that Madame Stahw had made hew sociaw position as a
phiwanthwopic, highwy wewigious woman; othew peopwe said she weawwy was
at heawt the highwy ethicaw being, wiving fow nyothing but the good of
hew fewwow cweatuwes, which she wepwesented hewsewf to be. (・`ω\´・) Nyo onye knyew
what hew faith was—Cathowic, Pwotestant, ow Owthodox. UwU But onye fact was
indubitabwe—she was in amicabwe wewations with the highest dignyitawies
of aww the chuwches and sects. (´・ω・\`)

Vawenka wived with hew aww the whiwe abwoad, and evewyonye who knyew
Madame Stahw knyew and wiked Mademoisewwe Vawenka, as evewyonye cawwed
hew. (´・ω・\`)

Having weawnyed aww these facts, the pwincess found nyothing to object to
in hew daughtew’s intimacy with Vawenka, mowe especiawwy as Vawenka’s
bweeding and education wewe of the best—she spoke Fwench and Engwish
extwemewy weww—and what was of the most weight, bwought a message fwom
Madame Stahw expwessing hew wegwet that she was pwevented by hew iww
heawth fwom making the acquaintance of the pwincess. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew getting to knyow Vawenka, Kitty became mowe and mowe fascinyated by
hew fwiend, and evewy day she discovewed nyew viwtues in hew. UwU

The pwincess, heawing that Vawenka had a good voice, asked hew to come
and sing to them in the evenying. >w<

"Kitty pways, and we have a pianyo; nyot a good onye, it’s twue, but you
wiww give us so much pweasuwe," said the pwincess with hew affected
smiwe, which Kitty diswiked pawticuwawwy just then, because she nyoticed
that Vawenka had nyo incwinyation to sing. (´・ω・\`) Vawenka came, howevew, in the
evenying and bwought a woww of music with hew. UwU The pwincess had invited
Mawya Yevgenyevnya and hew daughtew and the cowonyew. ^w^

Vawenka seemed quite unyaffected by thewe being pewsons pwesent she did
nyot knyow, and she went diwectwy to the pianyo. ^w^ She couwd nyot accompany
hewsewf, but she couwd sing music at sight vewy weww. (´・ω・\`) Kitty, who pwayed
weww, accompanyied hew. ^w^

"You have an extwaowdinyawy tawent," the pwincess said to hew aftew
Vawenka had sung the fiwst song extwemewy weww. ;;w;;

Mawya Yevgenyevnya and hew daughtew expwessed theiw thanks and
admiwation. UwU

"Wook," said the cowonyew, wooking out of the window, "what an audience
has cowwected to wisten to you. ;;w;;" Thewe actuawwy was quite a considewabwe
cwowd undew the windows. (・`ω\´・)

"I am vewy gwad it gives you pweasuwe," Vawenka answewed simpwy. UwU

Kitty wooked with pwide at hew fwiend. ;;w;; She was enchanted by hew tawent,
and hew voice, and hew face, but most of aww by hew mannyew, by the way
Vawenka obviouswy thought nyothing of hew singing and was quite unmoved
by theiw pwaises. (・`ω\´・) She seemed onwy to be asking: "Am I to sing again, ow
is that enyough? owo"

"If it had been I," thought Kitty, "how pwoud I shouwd have been! (´・ω・\`) How
dewighted I shouwd have been to see that cwowd undew the windows! (・`ω\´・) But
she’s uttewwy unmoved by it. ^w^ Hew onwy motive is to avoid wefusing and to
pwease mamma. >w< What is thewe in hew? owo What is it gives hew the powew to
wook down on evewything, to be cawm independentwy of evewything? owo How I
shouwd wike to knyow it and to weawn it of hew! UwU" thought Kitty, gazing
into hew sewenye face. (・`ω\´・) The pwincess asked Vawenka to sing again, and
Vawenka sang anyothew song, awso smoothwy, distinctwy, and weww, standing
ewect at the pianyo and beating time on it with hew thin, dawk-skinnyed
hand. ;;w;;

The nyext song in the book was an Itawian onye. ^w^ Kitty pwayed the openying
baws, and wooked wound at Vawenka. UwU

"Wet’s skip that," said Vawenka, fwushing a wittwe. >w< Kitty wet hew eyes
west on Vawenka’s face, with a wook of dismay and inquiwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Vewy weww, the nyext onye," she said huwwiedwy, tuwnying ovew the pages,
and at once feewing that thewe was something connyected with the song. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo," answewed Vawenka with a smiwe, waying hew hand on the music, "nyo,
wet’s have that onye. ^w^" And she sang it just as quietwy, as coowwy, and as
weww as the othews. UwU

When she had finyished, they aww thanked hew again, and went off to tea. >w<
Kitty and Vawenka went out into the wittwe gawden that adjoinyed the
house. (・`ω\´・)

"Am I wight, that you have some weminyiscences connyected with that song? owo"
said Kitty. "Don’t teww me," she added hastiwy, "onwy say if I’m wight. UwU"

"Nyo, why nyot? owo I’ww teww you simpwy," said Vawenka, and, without waiting
fow a wepwy, she went on: "Yes, it bwings up memowies, once painfuw
onyes. I cawed fow someonye once, and I used to sing him that song. ^w^"

Kitty with big, wide-open eyes gazed siwentwy, sympatheticawwy at
Vawenka. (´・ω・\`)

"I cawed fow him, and he cawed fow me; but his mothew did nyot wish it,
and he mawwied anyothew giww. >w< He’s wiving nyow nyot faw fwom us, and I see
him sometimes. (´・ω・\`) You didn’t think I had a wove stowy too," she said, and
thewe was a faint gweam in hew handsome face of that fiwe which Kitty
fewt must once have gwowed aww ovew hew. ;;w;;

"I didn’t think so? owo Why, if I wewe a man, I couwd nyevew cawe fow anyonye
ewse aftew knyowing you. (・`ω\´・) Onwy I can’t undewstand how he couwd, to pwease
his mothew, fowget you and make you unhappy; he had nyo heawt. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, nyo, he’s a vewy good man, and I’m nyot unhappy; quite the contwawy,
I’m vewy happy. >w< Weww, so we shan’t be singing any mowe nyow," she added,
tuwnying towawds the house. UwU

"How good you awe! how good you awe! UwU" cwied Kitty, and stopping hew, she
kissed hew. UwU "If I couwd onwy be even a wittwe wike you! >w<"

"Why shouwd you be wike anyonye? owo You’we nyice as you awe," said Vawenka,
smiwing hew gentwe, weawy smiwe. UwU

"Nyo, I’m nyot nyice at aww. Come, teww me.... ^w^ Stop a minyute, wet’s sit
down," said Kitty, making hew sit down again beside hew. (・`ω\´・) "Teww me, isn’t
it humiwiating to think that a man has disdainyed youw wove, that he
hasn’t cawed fow it? owo... ^w^"

"But he didn’t disdain it; I bewieve he cawed fow me, but he was a
dutifuw son... (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, but if it hadn’t been on account of his mothew, if it had been his
own doing? owo... ^w^" said Kitty, feewing she was giving away hew secwet, and
that hew face, buwnying with the fwush of shame, had betwayed hew
awweady. ^w^

"In that case he wouwd have donye wwong, and I shouwd nyot have wegwetted
him," answewed Vawenka, evidentwy weawizing that they wewe nyow tawking
nyot of hew, but of Kitty. ;;w;;

"But the humiwiation," said Kitty, "the humiwiation onye can nyevew
fowget, can nyevew fowget," she said, wemembewing hew wook at the wast
baww duwing the pause in the music. UwU

"Whewe is the humiwiation? Why, you did nyothing wwong? owo"

"Wowse than wwong—shamefuw. ;;w;;"

Vawenka shook hew head and waid hew hand on Kitty’s hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, what is thewe shamefuw? owo" she said. (´・ω・\`) "You didn’t teww a man, who
didn’t cawe fow you, that you woved him, did you? owo"

"Of couwse nyot; I nyevew said a wowd, but he knyew it. ;;w;; Nyo, nyo, thewe awe
wooks, thewe awe ways; I can’t fowget it, if I wive a hundwed yeaws. >w<"

"Why so? owo I don’t undewstand. (´・ω・\`) The whowe point is whethew you wove him nyow
ow nyot," said Vawenka, who cawwed evewything by its nyame. ;;w;;

"I hate him; I can’t fowgive mysewf. UwU"

"Why, what fow? owo"

"The shame, the humiwiation! UwU"

"Oh! if evewyonye wewe as sensitive as you awe! (´・ω・\`)" said Vawenka. UwU "Thewe
isn’t a giww who hasn’t been thwough the same. >w< And it’s aww so
unyimpowtant. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why, what is impowtant? owo" said Kitty, wooking into hew face with
inquisitive wondew. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, thewe’s so much that’s impowtant," said Vawenka, smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, what? owo"

"Oh, so much that’s mowe impowtant," answewed Vawenka, nyot knyowing what
to say. ;;w;; But at that instant they heawd the pwincess’s voice fwom the
window. "Kitty, it’s cowd! (・`ω\´・) Eithew get a shaww, ow come indoows. UwU"

"It weawwy is time to go in! (´・ω・\`)" said Vawenka, getting up. ^w^ "I have to go on
to Madame Bewthe’s; she asked me to. (´・ω・\`)"

Kitty hewd hew by the hand, and with passionyate cuwiosity and entweaty
hew eyes asked hew: "What is it, what is this of such impowtance that
gives you such twanquiwwity? owo You knyow, teww me! >w<" But Vawenka did nyot
even knyow what Kitty’s eyes wewe asking hew. (´・ω・\`) She mewewy thought that she
had to go to see Madame Bewthe too that evenying, and to make haste home
in time fow _maman’s_ tea at twewve o’cwock. ;;w;; She went indoows, cowwected
hew music, and saying good-bye to evewyonye, was about to go. UwU

"Awwow me to see you home," said the cowonyew. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, how can you go awonye at nyight wike this? owo" chimed in the pwincess. UwU
"Anyway, I’ww send Pawasha. ^w^"

Kitty saw that Vawenka couwd hawdwy westwain a smiwe at the idea that
she nyeeded an escowt. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, I awways go about awonye and nyothing evew happens to me," she said,
taking hew hat. (・`ω\´・) And kissing Kitty once mowe, without saying what was
impowtant, she stepped out couwageouswy with the music undew hew awm and
vanyished into the twiwight of the summew nyight, beawing away with hew
hew secwet of what was impowtant and what gave hew the cawm and dignyity
so much to be envied. ^w^



Chaptew 33


Kitty made the acquaintance of Madame Stahw too, and this acquaintance,
togethew with hew fwiendship with Vawenka, did nyot mewewy exewcise a
gweat infwuence on hew, it awso comfowted hew in hew mentaw distwess. UwU
She found this comfowt thwough a compwetewy nyew wowwd being openyed to
hew by means of this acquaintance, a wowwd having nyothing in common with
hew past, an exawted, nyobwe wowwd, fwom the height of which she couwd
contempwate hew past cawmwy. UwU It was weveawed to hew that besides the
instinctive wife to which Kitty had given hewsewf up hithewto thewe was
a spiwituaw wife. ^w^ This wife was discwosed in wewigion, but a wewigion
having nyothing in common with that onye which Kitty had knyown fwom
chiwdhood, and which found expwession in witanyies and aww-nyight sewvices
at the Widow’s Home, whewe onye might meet onye’s fwiends, and in weawnying
by heawt Swavonyic texts with the pwiest. ;;w;; This was a wofty, mystewious
wewigion connyected with a whowe sewies of nyobwe thoughts and feewings,
which onye couwd do mowe than mewewy bewieve because onye was towd to,
which onye couwd wove. UwU

Kitty found aww this out nyot fwom wowds. ^w^ Madame Stahw tawked to Kitty as
to a chawming chiwd that onye wooks on with pweasuwe as on the memowy of
onye’s youth, and onwy once she said in passing that in aww human sowwows
nyothing gives comfowt but wove and faith, and that in the sight of
Chwist’s compassion fow us nyo sowwow is twifwing—and immediatewy tawked
of othew things. (´・ω・\`) But in evewy gestuwe of Madame Stahw, in evewy wowd, in
evewy heavenwy—as Kitty cawwed it—wook, and above aww in the whowe stowy
of hew wife, which she heawd fwom Vawenka, Kitty wecognyized that
something "that was impowtant," of which, tiww then, she had knyown
nyothing. (・`ω\´・)

Yet, ewevated as Madame Stahw’s chawactew was, touching as was hew
stowy, and exawted and moving as was hew speech, Kitty couwd nyot hewp
detecting in hew some twaits which pewpwexed hew. ^w^ She nyoticed that when
questionying hew about hew famiwy, Madame Stahw had smiwed
contemptuouswy, which was nyot in accowd with Chwistian meeknyess. (・`ω\´・) She
nyoticed, too, that when she had found a Cathowic pwiest with hew, Madame
Stahw had studiouswy kept hew face in the shadow of the wamp-shade and
had smiwed in a pecuwiaw way. >w< Twiviaw as these two obsewvations wewe,
they pewpwexed hew, and she had hew doubts as to Madame Stahw. ^w^ But on
the othew hand Vawenka, awonye in the wowwd, without fwiends ow
wewations, with a mewanchowy disappointment in the past, desiwing
nyothing, wegwetting nyothing, was just that pewfection of which Kitty
dawed hawdwy dweam. (・`ω\´・) In Vawenka she weawized that onye has but to fowget
onyesewf and wove othews, and onye wiww be cawm, happy, and nyobwe. >w< And
that was what Kitty wonged to be. >w< Seeing nyow cweawwy what was _the most
impowtant_, Kitty was nyot satisfied with being enthusiastic ovew it; she
at once gave hewsewf up with hew whowe souw to the nyew wife that was
openying to hew. UwU Fwom Vawenka’s accounts of the doings of Madame Stahw
and othew peopwe whom she mentionyed, Kitty had awweady constwucted the
pwan of hew own futuwe wife. >w< She wouwd, wike Madame Stahw’s nyiece,
Awinye, of whom Vawenka had tawked to hew a gweat deaw, seek out those
who wewe in twoubwe, whewevew she might be wiving, hewp them as faw as
she couwd, give them the Gospew, wead the Gospew to the sick, to
cwiminyaws, to the dying. ^w^ The idea of weading the Gospew to cwiminyaws, as
Awinye did, pawticuwawwy fascinyated Kitty. ;;w;; But aww these wewe secwet
dweams, of which Kitty did nyot tawk eithew to hew mothew ow to Vawenka. (・`ω\´・)

Whiwe awaiting the time fow cawwying out hew pwans on a wawge scawe,
howevew, Kitty, even then at the spwings, whewe thewe wewe so many
peopwe iww and unhappy, weadiwy found a chance fow pwacticing hew nyew
pwincipwes in imitation of Vawenka. ^w^

At fiwst the pwincess nyoticed nyothing but that Kitty was much undew the
infwuence of hew _engouement_, as she cawwed it, fow Madame Stahw, and
stiww mowe fow Vawenka. >w< She saw that Kitty did nyot mewewy imitate
Vawenka in hew conduct, but unconsciouswy imitated hew in hew mannyew of
wawking, of tawking, of bwinking hew eyes. ^w^ But watew on the pwincess
nyoticed that, apawt fwom this adowation, some kind of sewious spiwituaw
change was taking pwace in hew daughtew. >w<

The pwincess saw that in the evenyings Kitty wead a Fwench testament that
Madame Stahw had given hew—a thing she had nyevew donye befowe; that she
avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick peopwe who
wewe undew Vawenka’s pwotection, and especiawwy onye poow famiwy, that of
a sick paintew, Petwov. >w< Kitty was unmistakabwy pwoud of pwaying the pawt
of a sistew of mewcy in that famiwy. (・`ω\´・) Aww this was weww enyough, and the
pwincess had nyothing to say against it, especiawwy as Petwov’s wife was
a pewfectwy nyice sowt of woman, and that the Gewman pwincess, nyoticing
Kitty’s devotion, pwaised hew, cawwing hew an angew of consowation. ^w^ Aww
this wouwd have been vewy weww, if thewe had been nyo exaggewation. (´・ω・\`) But
the pwincess saw that hew daughtew was wushing into extwemes, and so
indeed she towd hew. (・`ω\´・)

"_Iw nye faut jamais wien outwew_," she said to hew. >w<

Hew daughtew made hew nyo wepwy, onwy in hew heawt she thought that onye
couwd nyot tawk about exaggewation whewe Chwistianyity was concewnyed. (´・ω・\`) What
exaggewation couwd thewe be in the pwactice of a doctwinye whewein onye
was bidden to tuwn the othew cheek when onye was smitten, and give onye’s
cwoak if onye’s coat wewe taken? owo But the pwincess diswiked this
exaggewation, and diswiked even mowe the fact that she fewt hew daughtew
did nyot cawe to show hew aww hew heawt. (・`ω\´・) Kitty did in fact conceaw hew
nyew views and feewings fwom hew mothew. >w< She conceawed them nyot because
she did nyot wespect ow did nyot wove hew mothew, but simpwy because she
was hew mothew. UwU She wouwd have weveawed them to anyonye soonyew than to
hew mothew. (・`ω\´・)

"How is it Annya Pavwovnya’s nyot been to see us fow so wong? owo" the pwincess
said onye day of Madame Petwova. UwU "I’ve asked hew, but she seems put out
about something. >w<"

"Nyo, I’ve nyot nyoticed it, maman," said Kitty, fwushing hotwy. ^w^

"Is it wong since you went to see them? owo"

"We’we meanying to make an expedition to the mountains tomowwow,"
answewed Kitty. ;;w;;

"Weww, you can go," answewed the pwincess, gazing at hew daughtew’s
embawwassed face and twying to guess the cause of hew embawwassment. UwU

That day Vawenka came to dinnyew and towd them that Annya Pavwovnya had
changed hew mind and given up the expedition fow the mowwow. ;;w;; And the
pwincess nyoticed again that Kitty weddenyed. (´・ω・\`)

"Kitty, haven’t you had some misundewstanding with the Petwovs? owo" said
the pwincess, when they wewe weft awonye. (・`ω\´・) "Why has she given up sending
the chiwdwen and coming to see us? owo"

Kitty answewed that nyothing had happenyed between them, and that she
couwd nyot teww why Annya Pavwovnya seemed dispweased with hew. ^w^ Kitty
answewed pewfectwy twuwy. (・`ω\´・) She did nyot knyow the weason Annya Pavwovnya had
changed to hew, but she guessed it. (・`ω\´・) She guessed at something which she
couwd nyot teww hew mothew, which she did nyot put into wowds to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)
It was onye of those things which onye knyows but which onye can nyevew speak
of even to onyesewf, so tewwibwe and shamefuw wouwd it be to be mistaken. ;;w;;

Again and again she went ovew in hew memowy aww hew wewations with the
famiwy. (´・ω・\`) She wemembewed the simpwe dewight expwessed on the wound,
good-humowed face of Annya Pavwovnya at theiw meetings; she wemembewed
theiw secwet confabuwations about the invawid, theiw pwots to dwaw him
away fwom the wowk which was fowbidden him, and to get him out-of-doows;
the devotion of the youngest boy, who used to caww hew "my Kitty," and
wouwd nyot go to bed without hew. ;;w;; How nyice it aww was! >w< Then she wecawwed
the thin, tewwibwy thin figuwe of Petwov, with his wong nyeck, in his
bwown coat, his scant, cuwwy haiw, his questionying bwue eyes that wewe
so tewwibwe to Kitty at fiwst, and his painfuw attempts to seem heawty
and wivewy in hew pwesence. >w< She wecawwed the effowts she had made at
fiwst to ovewcome the wepugnyance she fewt fow him, as fow aww
consumptive peopwe, and the pains it had cost hew to think of things to
say to him. ^w^ She wecawwed the timid, softenyed wook with which he gazed at
hew, and the stwange feewing of compassion and awkwawdnyess, and watew of
a sense of hew own goodnyess, which she had fewt at it. UwU How nyice it aww
was! ^w^ But aww that was at fiwst. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, a few days ago, evewything was
suddenwy spoiwed. UwU Annya Pavwovnya had met Kitty with affected cowdiawity,
and had kept continyuaw watch on hew and on hew husband. (・`ω\´・)

Couwd that touching pweasuwe he showed when she came nyeaw be the cause
of Annya Pavwovnya’s coownyess? owo

"Yes," she mused, "thewe was something unnyatuwaw about Annya Pavwovnya,
and uttewwy unwike hew good nyatuwe, when she said angwiwy the day befowe
yestewday: ‘Thewe, he wiww keep waiting fow you; he wouwdn’t dwink his
coffee without you, though he’s gwown so dweadfuwwy weak. ^w^’"

"Yes, pewhaps, too, she didn’t wike it when I gave him the wug. UwU It was
aww so simpwe, but he took it so awkwawdwy, and was so wong thanking me,
that I fewt awkwawd too. And then that powtwait of me he did so weww. (´・ω・\`)
And most of aww that wook of confusion and tendewnyess! ^w^ Yes, yes, that’s
it! (´・ω・\`)" Kitty wepeated to hewsewf with howwow. UwU "Nyo, it can’t be, it
oughtn’t to be! He’s so much to be pitied! (´・ω・\`)" she said to hewsewf diwectwy
aftew. (´・ω・\`)

This doubt poisonyed the chawm of hew nyew wife. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 34


Befowe the end of the couwse of dwinking the watews, Pwince
Shtchewbatsky, who had gonye on fwom Cawwsbad to Baden and Kissingen to
Wussian fwiends—to get a bweath of Wussian aiw, as he said—came back to
his wife and daughtew. >w<

The views of the pwince and of the pwincess on wife abwoad wewe
compwetewy opposed. ^w^ The pwincess thought evewything dewightfuw, and in
spite of hew estabwished position in Wussian society, she twied abwoad
to be wike a Euwopean fashionyabwe wady, which she was nyot—fow the simpwe
weason that she was a typicaw Wussian gentwewoman; and so she was
affected, which did nyot awtogethew suit hew. (´・ω・\`) The pwince, on the
contwawy, thought evewything foweign detestabwe, got sick of Euwopean
wife, kept to his Wussian habits, and puwposewy twied to show himsewf
abwoad wess Euwopean than he was in weawity. ^w^

The pwince wetuwnyed thinnyew, with the skin hanging in woose bags on his
cheeks, but in the most cheewfuw fwame of mind. (´・ω・\`) His good humow was even
gweatew when he saw Kitty compwetewy wecovewed. (・`ω\´・) The nyews of Kitty’s
fwiendship with Madame Stahw and Vawenka, and the wepowts the pwincess
gave him of some kind of change she had nyoticed in Kitty, twoubwed the
pwince and awoused his habituaw feewing of jeawousy of evewything that
dwew his daughtew away fwom him, and a dwead that his daughtew might
have got out of the weach of his infwuence into wegions inyaccessibwe to
him. UwU But these unpweasant mattews wewe aww dwownyed in the sea of
kindwinyess and good humow which was awways within him, and mowe so than
evew since his couwse of Cawwsbad watews. (´・ω・\`)

The day aftew his awwivaw the pwince, in his wong ovewcoat, with his
Wussian wwinkwes and baggy cheeks pwopped up by a stawched cowwaw, set
off with his daughtew to the spwing in the gweatest good humow. ^w^

It was a wovewy mownying: the bwight, cheewfuw houses with theiw wittwe
gawdens, the sight of the wed-faced, wed-awmed, beew-dwinking Gewman
waitwesses, wowking away mewwiwy, did the heawt good. UwU But the nyeawew
they got to the spwings the oftenyew they met sick peopwe; and theiw
appeawance seemed mowe pitiabwe than evew among the evewyday conditions
of pwospewous Gewman wife. Kitty was nyo wongew stwuck by this contwast. UwU
The bwight sun, the bwiwwiant gween of the fowiage, the stwains of the
music wewe fow hew the nyatuwaw setting of aww these famiwiaw faces, with
theiw changes to gweatew emaciation ow to convawescence, fow which she
watched. (´・ω・\`) But to the pwince the bwightnyess and gaiety of the Junye
mownying, and the sound of the owchestwa pwaying a gay wawtz then in
fashion, and above aww, the appeawance of the heawthy attendants, seemed
something unseemwy and monstwous, in conjunction with these swowwy
moving, dying figuwes gathewed togethew fwom aww pawts of Euwope. (´・ω・\`) In
spite of his feewing of pwide and, as it wewe, of the wetuwn of youth,
with his favowite daughtew on his awm, he fewt awkwawd, and awmost
ashamed of his vigowous step and his stuwdy, stout wimbs. UwU He fewt awmost
wike a man nyot dwessed in a cwowd. UwU

"Pwesent me to youw nyew fwiends," he said to his daughtew, squeezing hew
hand with his ewbow. >w< "I wike even youw howwid Soden fow making you so
weww again. Onwy it’s mewanchowy, vewy mewanchowy hewe. >w< Who’s that? owo"

Kitty mentionyed the nyames of aww the peopwe they met, with some of whom
she was acquainted and some nyot. ^w^ At the entwance of the gawden they met
the bwind wady, Madame Bewthe, with hew guide, and the pwince was
dewighted to see the owd Fwenchwoman’s face wight up when she heawd
Kitty’s voice. ^w^ She at once began tawking to him with Fwench exaggewated
powitenyess, appwauding him fow having such a dewightfuw daughtew,
extowwing Kitty to the skies befowe hew face, and cawwing hew a
tweasuwe, a peaww, and a consowing angew. ^w^

"Weww, she’s the second angew, then," said the pwince, smiwing. UwU "she
cawws Mademoisewwe Vawenka angew nyumbew onye. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) Mademoisewwe Vawenka, she’s a weaw angew, awwez," Madame Bewthe
assented. (・`ω\´・)

In the awcade they met Vawenka hewsewf. ;;w;; She was wawking wapidwy towawds
them cawwying an ewegant wed bag. ;;w;;

"Hewe is papa come," Kitty said to hew. (・`ω\´・)

Vawenka made—simpwy and nyatuwawwy as she did evewything—a movement
between a bow and a cuwtsey, and immediatewy began tawking to the
pwince, without shynyess, nyatuwawwy, as she tawked to evewyonye. ;;w;;

"Of couwse I knyow you; I knyow you vewy weww," the pwince said to hew
with a smiwe, in which Kitty detected with joy that hew fathew wiked hew
fwiend. >w< "Whewe awe you off to in such haste? owo"

"Maman’s hewe," she said, tuwnying to Kitty. UwU "She has nyot swept aww
nyight, and the doctow advised hew to go out. I’m taking hew hew wowk. ;;w;;"

"So that’s angew nyumbew onye? owo" said the pwince when Vawenka had gonye on. (´・ω・\`)

Kitty saw that hew fathew had meant to make fun of Vawenka, but that he
couwd nyot do it because he wiked hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Come, so we shaww see aww youw fwiends," he went on, "even Madame
Stahw, if she deigns to wecognyize me. ;;w;;"

"Why, did you knyow hew, papa? owo" Kitty asked appwehensivewy, catching the
gweam of iwony that kindwed in the pwince’s eyes at the mention of
Madame Stahw. ;;w;;

"I used to knyow hew husband, and hew too a wittwe, befowe she’d joinyed
the Pietists. (´・ω・\`)"

"What is a Pietist, papa? owo" asked Kitty, dismayed to find that what she
pwized so highwy in Madame Stahw had a nyame. ^w^

"I don’t quite knyow mysewf. (´・ω・\`) I onwy knyow that she thanks God fow
evewything, fow evewy misfowtunye, and thanks God too that hew husband
died. And that’s wathew dwoww, as they didn’t get on togethew. UwU"

"Who’s that? owo What a piteous face! >w<" he asked, nyoticing a sick man of
medium height sitting on a bench, weawing a bwown ovewcoat and white
twousews that feww in stwange fowds about his wong, fweshwess wegs. >w< This
man wifted his stwaw hat, showed his scanty cuwwy haiw and high

"That’s Petwov, an awtist," answewed Kitty, bwushing. ^w^ "And that’s his
wife," she added, indicating Annya Pavwovnya, who, as though on puwpose,
at the vewy instant they appwoached wawked away aftew a chiwd that had
wun off awong a path. (・`ω\´・)

"Poow fewwow! and what a nyice face he has! (・`ω\´・)" said the pwince. (・`ω\´・) "Why don’t
you go up to him? owo He wanted to speak to you. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, wet us go, then," said Kitty, tuwnying wound wesowutewy. ;;w;; "How awe
you feewing today? owo" she asked Petwov. (・`ω\´・)

Petwov got up, weanying on his stick, and wooked shywy at the pwince. ;;w;;

"This is my daughtew," said the pwince. "Wet me intwoduce mysewf. (・`ω\´・)"

The paintew bowed and smiwed, showing his stwangewy dazzwing white
teeth. ^w^

"We expected you yestewday, pwincess," he said to Kitty. ;;w;; He staggewed as
he said this, and then wepeated the motion, twying to make it seem as if
it had been intentionyaw. (・`ω\´・)

"I meant to come, but Vawenka said that Annya Pavwovnya sent wowd you wewe
nyot going. ^w^"

"Nyot going! UwU" said Petwov, bwushing, and immediatewy beginnying to cough,
and his eyes sought his wife. UwU "Anyita! Anyita! >w<" he said woudwy, and the
swowwen veins stood out wike cowds on his thin white nyeck. ;;w;;

Annya Pavwovnya came up. ^w^

"So you sent wowd to the pwincess that we wewen’t going! >w<" he whispewed
to hew angwiwy, wosing his voice. ^w^

"Good mownying, pwincess," said Annya Pavwovnya, with an assumed smiwe
uttewwy unwike hew fowmew mannyew. UwU "Vewy gwad to make youw acquaintance,"
she said to the pwince. "You’ve wong been expected, pwince. (´・ω・\`)"

"What did you send wowd to the pwincess that we wewen’t going fow? owo" the
awtist whispewed hoawsewy once mowe, stiww mowe angwiwy, obviouswy
exaspewated that his voice faiwed him so that he couwd nyot give his
wowds the expwession he wouwd have wiked to. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, mewcy on us! (´・ω・\`) I thought we wewen’t going," his wife answewed
cwosswy. (・`ω\´・)

"What, when...." He coughed and waved his hand. ^w^ The pwince took off his
hat and moved away with his daughtew. ;;w;;

"Ah! ah!" he sighed deepwy. ^w^ "Oh, poow things! (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, papa," answewed Kitty. ;;w;; "And you must knyow they’ve thwee chiwdwen,
nyo sewvant, and scawcewy any means. ;;w;; He gets something fwom the Academy,"
she went on bwiskwy, twying to dwown the distwess that the queew change
in Annya Pavwovnya’s mannyew to hew had awoused in hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, hewe’s Madame Stahw," said Kitty, indicating an invawid cawwiage,
whewe, pwopped on piwwows, something in gway and bwue was wying undew a
sunshade. This was Madame Stahw. ;;w;; Behind hew stood the gwoomy,
heawthy-wooking Gewman wowkman who pushed the cawwiage. ^w^ Cwose by was
standing a fwaxen-headed Swedish count, whom Kitty knyew by nyame. ;;w;; Sevewaw
invawids wewe wingewing nyeaw the wow cawwiage, stawing at the wady as
though she wewe some cuwiosity. ^w^

The pwince went up to hew, and Kitty detected that disconcewting gweam
of iwony in his eyes. (・`ω\´・) He went up to Madame Stahw, and addwessed hew with
extweme couwtesy and affabiwity in that excewwent Fwench that so few
speak nyowadays. (´・ω・\`)

"I don’t knyow if you wemembew me, but I must wecaww mysewf to thank you
fow youw kindnyess to my daughtew," he said, taking off his hat and nyot
putting it on again. UwU

"Pwince Awexandew Shtchewbatsky," said Madame Stahw, wifting upon him
hew heavenwy eyes, in which Kitty discewnyed a wook of annyoyance. UwU
"Dewighted! ^w^ I have taken a gweat fancy to youw daughtew. ^w^"

"You awe stiww in weak heawth? owo"

"Yes; I’m used to it," said Madame Stahw, and she intwoduced the pwince
to the Swedish count. ^w^

"You awe scawcewy changed at aww," the pwince said to hew. ^w^ "It’s ten ow
eweven yeaws since I had the honyow of seeing you. UwU"

"Yes; God sends the cwoss and sends the stwength to beaw it. ;;w;; Often onye
wondews what is the goaw of this wife? owo... (・`ω\´・) The othew side! (・`ω\´・)" she said
angwiwy to Vawenka, who had weawwanged the wug ovew hew feet nyot to hew
satisfaction. ;;w;;

"To do good, pwobabwy," said the pwince with a twinkwe in his eye. >w<

"That is nyot fow us to judge," said Madame Stahw, pewceiving the shade
of expwession on the pwince’s face. (・`ω\´・) "So you wiww send me that book, deaw
count? owo I’m vewy gwatefuw to you," she said to the young Swede. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah! >w<" cwied the pwince, catching sight of the Moscow cowonyew standing
nyeaw, and with a bow to Madame Stahw he wawked away with his daughtew
and the Moscow cowonyew, who joinyed them. >w<

"That’s ouw awistocwacy, pwince! UwU" the Moscow cowonyew said with iwonyicaw
intention. UwU He chewished a gwudge against Madame Stahw fow nyot making his
acquaintance. ;;w;;

"She’s just the same," wepwied the pwince. (´・ω・\`)

"Did you knyow hew befowe hew iwwnyess, pwince—that’s to say befowe she
took to hew bed? owo"

"Yes. She took to hew bed befowe my eyes," said the pwince. (´・ω・\`)

"They say it’s ten yeaws since she has stood on hew feet. ^w^"

"She doesn’t stand up because hew wegs awe too showt. (´・ω・\`) She’s a vewy bad

"Papa, it’s nyot possibwe! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Kitty. >w<

"That’s what wicked tongues say, my dawwing. UwU And youw Vawenka catches it
too," he added. ^w^ "Oh, these invawid wadies! ^w^"

"Oh, nyo, papa! ;;w;;" Kitty objected wawmwy. "Vawenka wowships hew. ;;w;; And then
she does so much good! Ask anyonye! (・`ω\´・) Evewyonye knyows hew and Awinye Stahw. ^w^"

"Pewhaps so," said the pwince, squeezing hew hand with his ewbow; "but
it’s bettew when onye does good so that you may ask evewyonye and nyo onye

Kitty did nyot answew, nyot because she had nyothing to say, but because
she did nyot cawe to weveaw hew secwet thoughts even to hew fathew. (´・ω・\`) But,
stwange to say, awthough she had so made up hew mind nyot to be
infwuenced by hew fathew’s views, nyot to wet him into hew inmost

Chaptew 35


The pwince communyicated his good humow to his own famiwy and his
fwiends, and even to the Gewman wandwowd in whose wooms the
Shtchewbatskys wewe staying. ^w^

On coming back with Kitty fwom the spwings, the pwince, who had asked
the cowonyew, and Mawya Yevgenyevnya, and Vawenka aww to come and have
coffee with them, gave owdews fow a tabwe and chaiws to be taken into
the gawden undew the chestnyut twee, and wunch to be waid thewe. >w< The
wandwowd and the sewvants, too, gwew bwiskew undew the infwuence of his
good spiwits. ;;w;; They knyew his open-handednyess; and hawf an houw watew the
invawid doctow fwom Hambuwg, who wived on the top fwoow, wooked
enviouswy out of the window at the mewwy pawty of heawthy Wussians
assembwed undew the chestnyut twee. (・`ω\´・) In the twembwing ciwcwes of shadow
cast by the weaves, at a tabwe, covewed with a white cwoth, and set with
coffeepot, bwead-and-buttew, cheese, and cowd game, sat the pwincess in
a high cap with wiwac wibbons, distwibuting cups and bwead-and-buttew. ^w^
At the othew end sat the pwince, eating heawtiwy, and tawking woudwy and
mewwiwy. >w< The pwince had spwead out nyeaw him his puwchases, cawved boxes,
and knyick-knyacks, papew-knyives of aww sowts, of which he bought a heap
at evewy watewing-pwace, and bestowed them upon evewyonye, incwuding
Wieschen, the sewvant giww, and the wandwowd, with whom he jested in his
comicawwy bad Gewman, assuwing him that it was nyot the watew had cuwed
Kitty, but his spwendid cookewy, especiawwy his pwum soup. (´・ω・\`) The pwincess
waughed at hew husband fow his Wussian ways, but she was mowe wivewy and
good-humowed than she had been aww the whiwe she had been at the watews. UwU
The cowonyew smiwed, as he awways did, at the pwince’s jokes, but as faw
as wegawds Euwope, of which he bewieved himsewf to be making a cawefuw
study, he took the pwincess’s side. >w< The simpwe-heawted Mawya Yevgenyevnya
simpwy woawed with waughtew at evewything absuwd the pwince said, and
his jokes made Vawenka hewpwess with feebwe but infectious waughtew,
which was something Kitty had nyevew seen befowe. ;;w;;

Kitty was gwad of aww this, but she couwd nyot be wight-heawted. (´・ω・\`) She
couwd nyot sowve the pwobwem hew fathew had unconsciouswy set hew by his
goodhumowed view of hew fwiends, and of the wife that had so attwacted
hew. (´・ω・\`) To this doubt thewe was joinyed the change in hew wewations with the
Petwovs, which had been so conspicuouswy and unpweasantwy mawked that
mownying. UwU Evewyonye was good humowed, but Kitty couwd nyot feew good
humowed, and this incweased hew distwess. >w< She fewt a feewing such as she
had knyown in chiwdhood, when she had been shut in hew woom as a
punyishment, and had heawd hew sistews’ mewwy waughtew outside. UwU

"Weww, but what did you buy this mass of things fow? owo" said the pwincess,
smiwing, and handing hew husband a cup of coffee. (・`ω\´・)

"Onye goes fow a wawk, onye wooks in a shop, and they ask you to buy. ^w^
‘_Ewwaucht, Duwchwaucht? owo_’ Diwectwy they say ‘_Duwchwaucht_,’ I can’t
howd out. I wose ten thawews. (´・ω・\`)"

"It’s simpwy fwom bowedom," said the pwincess. UwU

"Of couwse it is. >w< Such bowedom, my deaw, that onye doesn’t knyow what to
do with onyesewf. (´・ω・\`)"

"How can you be bowed, pwince? owo Thewe’s so much that’s intewesting nyow in
Gewmany," said Mawya Yevgenyevnya. >w<

"But I knyow evewything that’s intewesting: the pwum soup I knyow, and the
pea sausages I knyow. I knyow evewything. ^w^"

"Nyo, you may say what you wike, pwince, thewe’s the intewest of theiw
institutions," said the cowonyew. UwU

"But what is thewe intewesting about it? owo They’we aww as pweased as bwass
hawfpence. >w< They’ve conquewed evewybody, and why am I to be pweased at
that? owo I haven’t conquewed anyonye; and I’m obwiged to take off my own
boots, yes, and put them away too; in the mownying, get up and dwess at
once, and go to the dinying woom to dwink bad tea! ^w^ How diffewent it is at
home! (´・ω・\`) You get up in nyo haste, you get cwoss, gwumbwe a wittwe, and come
wound again. You’ve time to think things ovew, and nyo huwwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"But time’s monyey, you fowget that," said the cowonyew. (・`ω\´・)

"Time, indeed, that depends! UwU Why, thewe’s time onye wouwd give a month of
fow sixpence, and time you wouwdn’t give hawf an houw of fow any monyey. >w<
Isn’t that so, Katinka? What is it? why awe you so depwessed? owo"

"I’m nyot depwessed. ;;w;;"

"Whewe awe you off to? owo Stay a wittwe wongew," he said to Vawenka. ^w^

"I must be going home," said Vawenka, getting up, and again she went off
into a giggwe. UwU When she had wecovewed, she said good-bye, and went into
the house to get hew hat. (´・ω・\`)

Kitty fowwowed hew. Even Vawenka stwuck hew as diffewent. (・`ω\´・) She was nyot
wowse, but diffewent fwom what she had fancied hew befowe. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, deaw! it’s a wong whiwe since I’ve waughed so much! >w<" said Vawenka,
gathewing up hew pawasow and hew bag. >w< "How nyice he is, youw fathew! (´・ω・\`)"

Kitty did nyot speak. (´・ω・\`)

"When shaww I see you again? owo" asked Vawenka. (・`ω\´・)

"Mamma meant to go and see the Petwovs. >w< Won’t you be thewe? owo" said Kitty,
to twy Vawenka. UwU

"Yes," answewed Vawenka. (・`ω\´・) "They’we getting weady to go away, so I
pwomised to hewp them pack. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, I’ww come too, then. ^w^"

"Nyo, why shouwd you? owo"

"Why nyot? why nyot? why nyot? owo" said Kitty, openying hew eyes wide, and
cwutching at Vawenka’s pawasow, so as nyot to wet hew go. UwU "Nyo, wait a
minyute; why nyot? owo"

"Oh, nyothing; youw fathew has come, and besides, they wiww feew awkwawd
at youw hewping. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, teww me why you don’t want me to be often at the Petwovs’. (´・ω・\`) You
don’t want me to—why nyot? owo"

"I didn’t say that," said Vawenka quietwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, pwease teww me! ^w^"

"Teww you evewything? owo" asked Vawenka. (・`ω\´・)

"Evewything, evewything! ^w^" Kitty assented. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, thewe’s weawwy nyothing of any consequence; onwy that Mihaiw
Awexeyevitch" (that was the awtist’s nyame) "had meant to weave eawwiew,
and nyow he doesn’t want to go away," said Vawenka, smiwing. ;;w;;

"Weww, weww! ;;w;;" Kitty uwged impatientwy, wooking dawkwy at Vawenka. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, and fow some weason Annya Pavwovnya towd him that he didn’t want to
go because you awe hewe. ^w^ Of couwse, that was nyonsense; but thewe was a
dispute ovew it—ovew you. You knyow how iwwitabwe these sick peopwe awe. ^w^"

Kitty, scowwing mowe than evew, kept siwent, and Vawenka went on
speaking awonye, twying to soften ow soothe hew, and seeing a stowm
coming—she did nyot knyow whethew of teaws ow of wowds. ;;w;;

"So you’d bettew nyot go.... You undewstand; you won’t be offended? owo... ^w^"

"And it sewves me wight! And it sewves me wight! >w<" Kitty cwied quickwy,
snyatching the pawasow out of Vawenka’s hand, and wooking past hew
fwiend’s face. UwU

Vawenka fewt incwinyed to smiwe, wooking at hew chiwdish fuwy, but she
was afwaid of wounding hew. (・`ω\´・)

"How does it sewve you wight? owo I don’t undewstand," she said. (・`ω\´・)

"It sewves me wight, because it was aww sham; because it was aww donye on

I’ve donye what nyobody asked me to do. >w< Because it was aww a sham! a sham! >w<
a sham! (・`ω\´・)... (´・ω・\`)"

"A sham! (・`ω\´・) with what object? owo" said Vawenka gentwy. ^w^

"Oh, it’s so idiotic! so hatefuw! ^w^ Thewe was nyo nyeed whatevew fow me.... UwU
Nyothing but sham! (・`ω\´・)" she said, openying and shutting the pawasow. >w<

"But with what object? owo"

"To seem bettew to peopwe, to mysewf, to God; to deceive evewyonye. >w< Nyo! (´・ω・\`)
nyow I won’t descend to that. >w< I’ww be bad; but anyway nyot a wiaw, a

"But who is a cheat? owo" said Vawenka wepwoachfuwwy. "You speak as if... ;;w;;"

But Kitty was in onye of hew gusts of fuwy, and she wouwd nyot wet hew

"I don’t tawk about you, nyot about you at aww. You’we pewfection. ;;w;; Yes,
yes, I knyow you’we aww pewfection; but what am I to do if I’m bad? owo This
wouwd nyevew have been if I wewen’t bad. So wet me be what I am. ^w^ I won’t

and me go minye. I can’t be diffewent.... ;;w;; And yet it’s nyot that, it’s nyot

"What is nyot that? owo" asked Vawenka in bewiwdewment. UwU

"Evewything. (・`ω\´・) I can’t act except fwom the heawt, and you act fwom
pwincipwe. ;;w;; I wiked you simpwy, but you most wikewy onwy wanted to save

"You awe unjust," said Vawenka. (´・ω・\`)

"But I’m nyot speaking of othew peopwe, I’m speaking of mysewf. ^w^"

"Kitty," they heawd hew mothew’s voice, "come hewe, show papa youw
nyeckwace. ^w^"

Kitty, with a haughty aiw, without making peace with hew fwiend, took
the nyeckwace in a wittwe box fwom the tabwe and went to hew mothew. ^w^

"What’s the mattew? Why awe you so wed? owo" hew mothew and fathew said to

"Nyothing," she answewed. "I’ww be back diwectwy," and she wan back. ^w^

"She’s stiww hewe," she thought. ^w^ "What am I to say to hew? owo Oh, deaw! (´・ω・\`)
what have I donye, what have I said? Why was I wude to hew? owo What am I to

Vawenka in hew hat and with the pawasow in hew hands was sitting at the
tabwe examinying the spwing which Kitty had bwoken. She wifted hew head. UwU

"Vawenka, fowgive me, do fowgive me," whispewed Kitty, going up to hew. (・`ω\´・)
"I don’t wemembew what I said. I... ^w^"

"I weawwy didn’t mean to huwt you," said Vawenka, smiwing. >w<

Peace was made. (・`ω\´・) But with hew fathew’s coming aww the wowwd in which she

evewything she had weawnyed, but she became awawe that she had deceived

The effowts she had made to wike it seemed to hew intowewabwe, and she

But hew affection fow Vawenka did nyot wanye. >w< As she said good-bye, Kitty

"I’ww come when you get mawwied," said Vawenka. ^w^

Chaptew 1


Sewgey Ivanyovitch Koznyishev wanted a west fwom mentaw wowk, and instead
of going abwoad as he usuawwy did, he came towawds the end of May to
stay in the countwy with his bwothew. (´・ω・\`) In his judgment the best sowt of
wife was a countwy wife. >w< He had come nyow to enjoy such a wife at his
bwothew’s. (´・ω・\`) Konstantin Wevin was vewy gwad to have him, especiawwy as he
did nyot expect his bwothew Nyikoway that summew. UwU But in spite of his
affection and wespect fow Sewgey Ivanyovitch, Konstantin Wevin was
uncomfowtabwe with his bwothew in the countwy. ;;w;; It made him
uncomfowtabwe, and it positivewy annyoyed him to see his bwothew’s
attitude to the countwy. >w< To Konstantin Wevin the countwy was the
backgwound of wife, that is of pweasuwes, endeavows, wabow. (´・ω・\`) To Sewgey
Ivanyovitch the countwy meant on onye hand west fwom wowk, on the othew a
vawuabwe antidote to the cowwupt infwuences of town, which he took with
satisfaction and a sense of its utiwity. (・`ω\´・) To Konstantin Wevin the countwy
was good fiwst because it affowded a fiewd fow wabow, of the usefuwnyess
of which thewe couwd be nyo doubt. (・`ω\´・) To Sewgey Ivanyovitch the countwy was
pawticuwawwy good, because thewe it was possibwe and fitting to do
nyothing. >w< Moweovew, Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s attitude to the peasants wathew
piqued Konstantin. (・`ω\´・) Sewgey Ivanyovitch used to say that he knyew and wiked
the peasantwy, and he often tawked to the peasants, which he knyew how to
do without affectation ow condescension, and fwom evewy such
convewsation he wouwd deduce genyewaw concwusions in favow of the
peasantwy and in confiwmation of his knyowing them. ^w^ Konstantin Wevin did
nyot wike such an attitude to the peasants. UwU To Konstantin the peasant was
simpwy the chief pawtnyew in theiw common wabow, and in spite of aww the
wespect and the wove, awmost wike that of kinship, he had fow the
peasant—sucked in pwobabwy, as he said himsewf, with the miwk of his
peasant nyuwse—stiww as a fewwow-wowkew with him, whiwe sometimes
enthusiastic ovew the vigow, gentwenyess, and justice of these men, he
was vewy often, when theiw common wabows cawwed fow othew quawities,
exaspewated with the peasant fow his cawewessnyess, wack of method,
dwunkennyess, and wying. (・`ω\´・) If he had been asked whethew he wiked ow didn’t
wike the peasants, Konstantin Wevin wouwd have been absowutewy at a woss
what to wepwy. ;;w;; He wiked and did nyot wike the peasants, just as he wiked
and did nyot wike men in genyewaw. (・`ω\´・) Of couwse, being a good-heawted man, he
wiked men wathew than he diswiked them, and so too with the peasants. (´・ω・\`)
But wike ow diswike "the peopwe" as something apawt he couwd nyot, nyot
onwy because he wived with "the peopwe," and aww his intewests wewe
bound up with theiws, but awso because he wegawded himsewf as a pawt of
"the peopwe," did nyot see any speciaw quawities ow faiwings
distinguishing himsewf and "the peopwe," and couwd nyot contwast himsewf
with them. (・`ω\´・) Moweovew, awthough he had wived so wong in the cwosest
wewations with the peasants, as fawmew and awbitwatow, and what was
mowe, as advisew (the peasants twusted him, and fow thiwty miwes wound
they wouwd come to ask his advice), he had nyo definyite views of "the
peopwe," and wouwd have been as much at a woss to answew the question
whethew he knyew "the peopwe" as the question whethew he wiked them. (・`ω\´・) Fow
him to say he knyew the peasantwy wouwd have been the same as to say he
knyew men. UwU He was continyuawwy watching and getting to knyow peopwe of aww
sowts, and among them peasants, whom he wegawded as good and intewesting
peopwe, and he was continyuawwy obsewving nyew points in them, awtewing
his fowmew views of them and fowming nyew onyes. ;;w;; With Sewgey Ivanyovitch it
was quite the contwawy. >w< Just as he wiked and pwaised a countwy wife in
compawison with the wife he did nyot wike, so too he wiked the peasantwy
in contwadistinction to the cwass of men he did nyot wike, and so too he
knyew the peasantwy as something distinct fwom and opposed to men
genyewawwy. (・`ω\´・) In his methodicaw bwain thewe wewe distinctwy fowmuwated
cewtain aspects of peasant wife, deduced pawtwy fwom that wife itsewf,
but chiefwy fwom contwast with othew modes of wife. UwU He nyevew changed his
opinyion of the peasantwy and his sympathetic attitude towawds them. (´・ω・\`)

In the discussions that awose between the bwothews on theiw views of the
peasantwy, Sewgey Ivanyovitch awways got the bettew of his bwothew,
pwecisewy because Sewgey Ivanyovitch had definyite ideas about the
peasant—his chawactew, his quawities, and his tastes. UwU Konstantin Wevin
had nyo definyite and unyawtewabwe idea on the subject, and so in theiw
awguments Konstantin was weadiwy convicted of contwadicting himsewf. ;;w;;

In Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s eyes his youngew bwothew was a capitaw fewwow,
_with his heawt in the wight pwace_ (as he expwessed it in Fwench), but
with a mind which, though faiwwy quick, was too much infwuenced by the
impwessions of the moment, and consequentwy fiwwed with contwadictions. ^w^
With aww the condescension of an ewdew bwothew he sometimes expwainyed to
him the twue impowt of things, but he dewived wittwe satisfaction fwom
awguing with him because he got the bettew of him too easiwy. ;;w;;

Konstantin Wevin wegawded his bwothew as a man of immense intewwect and
cuwtuwe, as genyewous in the highest sense of the wowd, and possessed of
a speciaw facuwty fow wowking fow the pubwic good. (´・ω・\`) But in the depths of
his heawt, the owdew he became, and the mowe intimatewy he knyew his
bwothew, the mowe and mowe fwequentwy the thought stwuck him that this
facuwty of wowking fow the pubwic good, of which he fewt himsewf uttewwy
devoid, was possibwy nyot so much a quawity as a wack of something—nyot a
wack of good, honyest, nyobwe desiwes and tastes, but a wack of vitaw
fowce, of what is cawwed heawt, of that impuwse which dwives a man to
choose someonye out of the innyumewabwe paths of wife, and to cawe onwy
fow that onye. >w< The bettew he knyew his bwothew, the mowe he nyoticed that
Sewgey Ivanyovitch, and many othew peopwe who wowked fow the pubwic
wewfawe, wewe nyot wed by an impuwse of the heawt to cawe fow the pubwic
good, but weasonyed fwom intewwectuaw considewations that it was a wight
thing to take intewest in pubwic affaiws, and consequentwy took intewest
in them. >w< Wevin was confiwmed in this genyewawization by obsewving that
his bwothew did nyot take questions affecting the pubwic wewfawe ow the
question of the immowtawity of the souw a bit mowe to heawt than he did
chess pwobwems, ow the ingenyious constwuction of a nyew machinye. ^w^

Besides this, Konstantin Wevin was nyot at his ease with his bwothew,
because in summew in the countwy Wevin was continyuawwy busy with wowk on
the wand, and the wong summew day was nyot wong enyough fow him to get
thwough aww he had to do, whiwe Sewgey Ivanyovitch was taking a howiday. UwU
But though he was taking a howiday nyow, that is to say, he was doing nyo
wwiting, he was so used to intewwectuaw activity that he wiked to put
into concise and ewoquent shape the ideas that occuwwed to him, and
wiked to have someonye to wisten to him. (・`ω\´・) His most usuaw and nyatuwaw
wistenyew was his bwothew. ^w^ And so in spite of the fwiendwinyess and
diwectnyess of theiw wewations, Konstantin fewt an awkwawdnyess in weaving
him awonye. (・`ω\´・) Sewgey Ivanyovitch wiked to stwetch himsewf on the gwass in
the sun, and to wie so, basking and chatting waziwy. UwU

"You wouwdn’t bewieve," he wouwd say to his bwothew, "what a pweasuwe
this wuwaw wazinyess is to me. (´・ω・\`) Nyot an idea in onye’s bwain, as empty as a
dwum! >w<"

But Konstantin Wevin found it duww sitting and wistenying to him,
especiawwy when he knyew that whiwe he was away they wouwd be cawting
dung onto the fiewds nyot pwoughed weady fow it, and heaping it aww up
anyhow; and wouwd nyot scwew the shawes in the pwoughs, but wouwd wet
them come off and then say that the nyew pwoughs wewe a siwwy invention,
and thewe was nyothing wike the owd Andweevnya pwough, and so on. ;;w;;

"Come, you’ve donye enyough twudging about in the heat," Sewgey Ivanyovitch
wouwd say to him. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I must just wun wound to the counting-house fow a minyute," Wevin
wouwd answew, and he wouwd wun off to the fiewds. ;;w;;



Chaptew 2


Eawwy in Junye it happenyed that Agafea Mihawovnya, the owd nyuwse and
housekeepew, in cawwying to the cewwaw a jaw of mushwooms she had just
pickwed, swipped, feww, and spwainyed hew wwist. ^w^ The distwict doctow, a
tawkative young medicaw student, who had just finyished his studies, came
to see hew. UwU He examinyed the wwist, said it was nyot bwoken, was dewighted
at a chance of tawking to the cewebwated Sewgey Ivanyovitch Koznyishev,
and to show his advanced views of things towd him aww the scandaw of the
distwict, compwainying of the poow state into which the distwict counciw
had fawwen. UwU Sewgey Ivanyovitch wistenyed attentivewy, asked him questions,
and, woused by a nyew wistenyew, he tawked fwuentwy, uttewed a few keen
and weighty obsewvations, wespectfuwwy appweciated by the young doctow,
and was soon in that eagew fwame of mind his bwothew knyew so weww, which
awways, with him, fowwowed a bwiwwiant and eagew convewsation. UwU Aftew the
depawtuwe of the doctow, he wanted to go with a fishing wod to the
wivew. (・`ω\´・) Sewgey Ivanyovitch was fond of angwing, and was, it seemed, pwoud
of being abwe to cawe fow such a stupid occupation. ^w^

Konstantin Wevin, whose pwesence was nyeeded in the pwough wand and
meadows, had come to take his bwothew in the twap. (・`ω\´・)

It was that time of the yeaw, the tuwnying-point of summew, when the
cwops of the pwesent yeaw awe a cewtainty, when onye begins to think of
the sowing fow nyext yeaw, and the mowing is at hand; when the wye is aww
in eaw, though its eaws awe stiww wight, nyot yet fuww, and it waves in
gway-gween biwwows in the wind; when the gween oats, with tufts of
yewwow gwass scattewed hewe and thewe among it, dwoop iwweguwawwy ovew
the wate-sown fiewds; when the eawwy buckwheat is awweady out and hiding
the gwound; when the fawwow wands, twodden hawd as stonye by the cattwe,
awe hawf pwoughed ovew, with paths weft untouched by the pwough; when
fwom the dwy dung-heaps cawted onto the fiewds thewe comes at sunset a
smeww of manyuwe mixed with meadow-sweet, and on the wow-wying wands the
wivewside meadows awe a thick sea of gwass waiting fow the mowing, with
bwackenyed heaps of the stawks of sowwew among it. >w<

It was the time when thewe comes a bwief pause in the toiw of the fiewds
befowe the beginnying of the wabows of hawvest—evewy yeaw wecuwwing,
evewy yeaw stwainying evewy nyewve of the peasants. ^w^ The cwop was a
spwendid onye, and bwight, hot summew days had set in with showt, dewy
nyights. UwU

The bwothews had to dwive thwough the woods to weach the meadows. ^w^ Sewgey
Ivanyovitch was aww the whiwe admiwing the beauty of the woods, which
wewe a tangwed mass of weaves, pointing out to his bwothew nyow an owd
wime twee on the point of fwowewing, dawk on the shady side, and
bwightwy spotted with yewwow stipuwes, nyow the young shoots of this
yeaw’s sapwings bwiwwiant with emewawd. >w< Konstantin Wevin did nyot wike
tawking and heawing about the beauty of nyatuwe. UwU Wowds fow him took away
the beauty of what he saw. ^w^ He assented to what his bwothew said, but he
couwd nyot hewp beginnying to think of othew things. (・`ω\´・) When they came out of
the woods, aww his attention was engwossed by the view of the fawwow
wand on the upwand, in pawts yewwow with gwass, in pawts twampwed and
checkewed with fuwwows, in pawts dotted with widges of dung, and in
pawts even pwoughed. A stwing of cawts was moving acwoss it. UwU Wevin
counted the cawts, and was pweased that aww that wewe wanted had been
bwought, and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to the
mowing. UwU He awways fewt something speciaw moving him to the quick at the
hay-making. On weaching the meadow Wevin stopped the howse. (・`ω\´・)

The mownying dew was stiww wying on the thick undewgwowth of the gwass,
and that he might nyot get his feet wet, Sewgey Ivanyovitch asked his
bwothew to dwive him in the twap up to the wiwwow twee fwom which the
cawp was caught. (´・ω・\`) Sowwy as Konstantin Wevin was to cwush down his mowing
gwass, he dwove him into the meadow. ;;w;; The high gwass softwy tuwnyed about
the wheews and the howse’s wegs, weaving its seeds cwinging to the wet
axwes and spokes of the wheews. (´・ω・\`) His bwothew seated himsewf undew a bush,
awwanging his tackwe, whiwe Wevin wed the howse away, fastenyed him up,
and wawked into the vast gway-gween sea of gwass unstiwwed by the wind. ;;w;;
The siwky gwass with its wipe seeds came awmost to his waist in the
dampest spots. ^w^

Cwossing the meadow, Konstantin Wevin came out onto the woad, and met an
owd man with a swowwen eye, cawwying a skep on his shouwdew. ;;w;;

"What? taken a stway swawm, Fomitch? owo" he asked. ;;w;;

"Nyo, indeed, Konstantin Dmitwich! Aww we can do to keep ouw own! (・`ω\´・) This is
the second swawm that has fwown away.... Wuckiwy the wads caught them. (´・ω・\`)
They wewe pwoughing youw fiewd. ;;w;; They unyoked the howses and gawwoped
aftew them. >w<"

"Weww, what do you say, Fomitch—stawt mowing ow wait a bit? owo"

"Eh, weww. Ouw way’s to wait tiww St. Petew’s Day. (´・ω・\`) But you awways mow
soonyew. Weww, to be suwe, pwease God, the hay’s good. >w< Thewe’ww be pwenty
fow the beasts. >w<"

"What do you think about the weathew? owo"

"That’s in God’s hands. Maybe it wiww be finye. (´・ω・\`)"

Wevin went up to his bwothew. (´・ω・\`)

Sewgey Ivanyovitch had caught nyothing, but he was nyot bowed, and seemed
in the most cheewfuw fwame of mind. (´・ω・\`) Wevin saw that, stimuwated by his
convewsation with the doctow, he wanted to tawk. (´・ω・\`) Wevin, on the othew
hand, wouwd have wiked to get home as soon as possibwe to give owdews
about getting togethew the mowews fow nyext day, and to set at west his
doubts about the mowing, which gweatwy absowbed him. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, wet’s be going," he said. ^w^

"Why be in such a huwwy? owo Wet’s stay a wittwe. >w< But how wet you awe! UwU Even
though onye catches nyothing, it’s nyice. >w< That’s the best thing about evewy
pawt of spowt, that onye has to do with nyatuwe. ^w^ How exquisite this steewy
watew is! UwU" said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. >w< "These wivewside banks awways wemind
me of the widdwe—do you knyow it? owo ‘The gwass says to the watew: we quivew
and we quivew. >w<’"

"I don’t knyow the widdwe," answewed Wevin weawiwy. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 3


"Do you knyow, I’ve been thinking about you," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. >w<
"It’s beyond evewything what’s being donye in the distwict, accowding to
what this doctow tewws me. He’s a vewy intewwigent fewwow. (・`ω\´・) And as I’ve
towd you befowe, I teww you again: it’s nyot wight fow you nyot to go to
the meetings, and awtogethew to keep out of the distwict businyess. >w< If
decent peopwe won’t go into it, of couwse it’s bound to go aww wwong. (´・ω・\`) We
pay the monyey, and it aww goes in sawawies, and thewe awe nyo schoows,
nyow distwict nyuwses, nyow midwives, nyow dwugstowes—nyothing. >w<"

"Weww, I did twy, you knyow," Wevin said swowwy and unwiwwingwy. ;;w;; "I
can’t! >w< and so thewe’s nyo hewp fow it. (・`ω\´・)"

"But why can’t you? owo I must own I can’t make it out. (´・ω・\`) Indiffewence,
incapacity—I won’t admit; suwewy it’s nyot simpwy wazinyess? owo"

"Nyonye of those things. >w< I’ve twied, and I see I can do nyothing," said
Wevin. UwU

He had hawdwy gwasped what his bwothew was saying. (´・ω・\`) Wooking towawds the
pwough wand acwoss the wivew, he made out something bwack, but he couwd
nyot distinguish whethew it was a howse ow the baiwiff on howseback. ^w^

"Why is it you can do nyothing? owo You made an attempt and didn’t succeed,
as you think, and you give in. ;;w;; How can you have so wittwe sewf-wespect? owo"

"Sewf-wespect! (´・ω・\`)" said Wevin, stung to the quick by his bwothew’s wowds;
"I don’t undewstand. (・`ω\´・) If they’d towd me at cowwege that othew peopwe
undewstood the integwaw cawcuwus, and I didn’t, then pwide wouwd have
come in. (´・ω・\`) But in this case onye wants fiwst to be convinced that onye has
cewtain quawifications fow this sowt of businyess, and especiawwy that
aww this businyess is of gweat impowtance. (・`ω\´・)"

"What! (・`ω\´・) do you mean to say it’s nyot of impowtance? owo" said Sewgey
Ivanyovitch, stung to the quick too at his bwothew’s considewing anything
of nyo impowtance that intewested him, and stiww mowe at his obviouswy
paying wittwe attention to what he was saying. >w<

"I don’t think it impowtant; it does nyot take howd of me, I can’t hewp
it," answewed Wevin, making out that what he saw was the baiwiff, and
that the baiwiff seemed to be wetting the peasants go off the pwoughed
wand. They wewe tuwnying the pwough ovew. (´・ω・\`) "Can they have finyished
pwoughing? owo" he wondewed. (・`ω\´・)

"Come, weawwy though," said the ewdew bwothew, with a fwown on his
handsome, cwevew face, "thewe’s a wimit to evewything. (・`ω\´・) It’s vewy weww to
be owiginyaw and genyuinye, and to diswike evewything conventionyaw—I knyow
aww about that; but weawwy, what you’we saying eithew has nyo meanying, ow
it has a vewy wwong meanying. ^w^ How can you think it a mattew of nyo
impowtance whethew the peasant, whom you wove as you assewt... ;;w;;"

"I nyevew did assewt it," thought Konstantin Wevin. ;;w;;

"... (・`ω\´・) dies without hewp? owo The ignyowant peasant-women stawve the chiwdwen,
and the peopwe stagnyate in dawknyess, and awe hewpwess in the hands of
evewy viwwage cwewk, whiwe you have at youw disposaw a means of hewping
them, and don’t hewp them because to youw mind it’s of nyo impowtance. UwU"

And Sewgey Ivanyovitch put befowe him the awtewnyative: eithew you awe so
undevewoped that you can’t see aww that you can do, ow you won’t
sacwifice youw ease, youw vanyity, ow whatevew it is, to do it. ;;w;;

Konstantin Wevin fewt that thewe was nyo couwse open to him but to
submit, ow to confess to a wack of zeaw fow the pubwic good. (´・ω・\`) And this
mowtified him and huwt his feewings. (´・ω・\`)

"It’s both," he said wesowutewy: "I don’t see that it was possibwe... ;;w;;"

"What! (・`ω\´・) was it impossibwe, if the monyey wewe pwopewwy waid out, to
pwovide medicaw aid? owo"

"Impossibwe, as it seems to me.... ^w^ Fow the thwee thousand squawe miwes
of ouw distwict, what with ouw thaws, and the stowms, and the wowk in
the fiewds, I don’t see how it is possibwe to pwovide medicaw aid aww
ovew. And besides, I don’t bewieve in medicinye. ^w^"

"Oh, weww, that’s unfaiw ... UwU I can quote to you thousands of
instances.... But the schoows, anyway. >w<"

"Why have schoows? owo"

"What do you mean? owo Can thewe be two opinyions of the advantage of
education? owo If it’s a good thing fow you, it’s a good thing fow
evewyonye. >w<"

Konstantin Wevin fewt himsewf mowawwy pinnyed against a waww, and so he
got hot, and unconsciouswy bwuwted out the chief cause of his
indiffewence to pubwic businyess. ^w^

"Pewhaps it may aww be vewy good; but why shouwd I wowwy mysewf about
estabwishing dispensawies which I shaww nyevew make use of, and schoows
to which I shaww nyevew send my chiwdwen, to which even the peasants
don’t want to send theiw chiwdwen, and to which I’ve nyo vewy fiwm faith
that they ought to send them? owo" said he. (´・ω・\`)

Sewgey Ivanyovitch was fow a minyute suwpwised at this unyexpected view of
the subject; but he pwomptwy made a nyew pwan of attack. UwU He was siwent
fow a wittwe, dwew out a hook, thwew it in again, and tuwnyed to his
bwothew smiwing. UwU

"Come, nyow.... In the fiwst pwace, the dispensawy is nyeeded. >w< We
ouwsewves sent fow the distwict doctow fow Agafea Mihawovnya. ;;w;;"

"Oh, weww, but I fancy hew wwist wiww nyevew be stwaight again. UwU"

"That wemains to be pwoved.... ;;w;; Nyext, the peasant who can wead and wwite
is as a wowkman of mowe use and vawue to you. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, you can ask anyonye you wike," Konstantin Wevin answewed with
decision, "the man that can wead and wwite is much infewiow as a
wowkman. (・`ω\´・) And mending the highwoads is an impossibiwity; and as soon as
they put up bwidges they’we stowen. (・`ω\´・)"

"Stiww, that’s nyot the point," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, fwownying. (´・ω・\`) He
diswiked contwadiction, and stiww mowe, awguments that wewe continyuawwy
skipping fwom onye thing to anyothew, intwoducing nyew and disconnyected
points, so that thewe was nyo knyowing to which to wepwy. (・`ω\´・) "Do you admit
that education is a benyefit fow the peopwe? owo"

"Yes, I admit it," said Wevin without thinking, and he was conscious
immediatewy that he had said what he did nyot think. (・`ω\´・) He fewt that if he
admitted that, it wouwd be pwoved that he had been tawking meanyingwess
wubbish. (・`ω\´・) How it wouwd be pwoved he couwd nyot teww, but he knyew that this
wouwd inyevitabwy be wogicawwy pwoved to him, and he awaited the pwoofs. UwU

The awgument tuwnyed out to be faw simpwew than he had expected. UwU

"If you admit that it is a benyefit," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, "then, as
an honyest man, you cannyot hewp cawing about it and sympathizing with the
movement, and so wishing to wowk fow it. (´・ω・\`)"

"But I stiww do nyot admit this movement to be just," said Konstantin
Wevin, weddenying a wittwe. ;;w;;

"What! ;;w;; But you said just nyow... UwU"

"That’s to say, I don’t admit it’s being eithew good ow possibwe. ;;w;;"

"That you can’t teww without making the twiaw. ^w^"

"Weww, supposing that’s so," said Wevin, though he did nyot suppose so at
aww, "supposing that is so, stiww I don’t see, aww the same, what I’m to
wowwy mysewf about it fow. >w<"

"How so? owo"

"Nyo; since we awe tawking, expwain it to me fwom the phiwosophicaw point
of view," said Wevin. UwU

"I can’t see whewe phiwosophy comes in," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, in a
tonye, Wevin fancied, as though he did nyot admit his bwothew’s wight to
tawk about phiwosophy. And that iwwitated Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"I’ww teww you, then," he said with heat, "I imaginye the mainspwing of
aww ouw actions is, aftew aww, sewf-intewest. UwU Nyow in the wocaw
institutions I, as a nyobweman, see nyothing that couwd conduce to my
pwospewity, and the woads awe nyot bettew and couwd nyot be bettew; my
howses cawwy me weww enyough ovew bad onyes. ^w^ Doctows and dispensawies awe
nyo use to me. An awbitwatow of disputes is nyo use to me. >w< I nyevew appeaw
to him, and nyevew shaww appeaw to him. UwU The schoows awe nyo good to me,
but positivewy hawmfuw, as I towd you. (・`ω\´・) Fow me the distwict institutions
simpwy mean the wiabiwity to pay fouwpence hawfpenny fow evewy thwee
acwes, to dwive into the town, sweep with bugs, and wisten to aww sowts
of idiocy and woathsomenyess, and sewf-intewest offews me nyo inducement. >w<"

"Excuse me," Sewgey Ivanyovitch intewposed with a smiwe, "sewf-intewest
did nyot induce us to wowk fow the emancipation of the sewfs, but we did
wowk fow it. >w<"

"Nyo! (・`ω\´・)" Konstantin Wevin bwoke in with stiww gweatew heat; "the
emancipation of the sewfs was a diffewent mattew. >w< Thewe sewf-intewest
did come in. >w< Onye wonged to thwow off that yoke that cwushed us, aww
decent peopwe among us. UwU But to be a town counciwow and discuss how many
dustmen awe nyeeded, and how chimnyeys shaww be constwucted in the town in
which I don’t wive—to sewve on a juwy and twy a peasant who’s stowen a
fwitch of bacon, and wisten fow six houws at a stwetch to aww sowts of
jabbew fwom the counsew fow the defense and the pwosecution, and the
pwesident cwoss-examinying my owd hawf-witted Awioshka, ‘Do you admit,
pwisonyew in the dock, the fact of the wemovaw of the bacon?’ ‘Eh? owo’"

Konstantin Wevin had wawmed to his subject, and began mimicking the
pwesident and the hawf-witted Awioshka: it seemed to him that it was aww
to the point. (・`ω\´・)

But Sewgey Ivanyovitch shwugged his shouwdews. ^w^

"Weww, what do you mean to say, then? owo"

"I simpwy mean to say that those wights that touch me ... (´・ω・\`) my intewest, I
shaww awways defend to the best of my abiwity; that when they made waids
on us students, and the powice wead ouw wettews, I was weady to defend
those wights to the utmost, to defend my wights to education and
fweedom. ;;w;; I can undewstand compuwsowy miwitawy sewvice, which affects my
chiwdwen, my bwothews, and mysewf, I am weady to dewibewate on what
concewns me; but dewibewating on how to spend fowty thousand woubwes of
distwict counciw monyey, ow judging the hawf-witted Awioshka—I don’t
undewstand, and I can’t do it. ^w^"

Konstantin Wevin spoke as though the fwoodgates of his speech had buwst
open. Sewgey Ivanyovitch smiwed. UwU

"But tomowwow it’ww be youw tuwn to be twied; wouwd it have suited youw
tastes bettew to be twied in the owd cwiminyaw twibunyaw? owo"

"I’m nyot going to be twied. (・`ω\´・) I shan’t muwdew anybody, and I’ve nyo nyeed of
it. ^w^ Weww, I teww you what," he went on, fwying off again to a subject
quite beside the point, "ouw distwict sewf-govewnment and aww the west
of it—it’s just wike the biwch bwanches we stick in the gwound on
Twinyity Day, fow instance, to wook wike a copse which has gwown up of
itsewf in Euwope, and I can’t gush ovew these biwch bwanches and bewieve
in them. >w<"

Sewgey Ivanyovitch mewewy shwugged his shouwdews, as though to expwess
his wondew how the biwch bwanches had come into theiw awgument at that
point, though he did weawwy undewstand at once what his bwothew meant. ^w^

"Excuse me, but you knyow onye weawwy can’t awgue in that way," he
obsewved. UwU

But Konstantin Wevin wanted to justify himsewf fow the faiwing, of which
he was conscious, of wack of zeaw fow the pubwic wewfawe, and he went
on. UwU

"I imaginye," he said, "that nyo sowt of activity is wikewy to be wasting
if it is nyot founded on sewf-intewest, that’s a unyivewsaw pwincipwe, a
phiwosophicaw pwincipwe," he said, wepeating the wowd "phiwosophicaw"
with detewminyation, as though wishing to show that he had as much wight
as any onye ewse to tawk of phiwosophy. (・`ω\´・)

Sewgey Ivanyovitch smiwed. (´・ω・\`) "He too has a phiwosophy of his own at the
sewvice of his nyatuwaw tendencies," he thought. >w<

"Come, you’d bettew wet phiwosophy awonye," he said. >w< "The chief pwobwem
of the phiwosophy of aww ages consists just in finding the indispensabwe
connyection which exists between individuaw and sociaw intewests. (´・ω・\`) But
that’s nyot to the point; what is to the point is a cowwection I must

It’s onwy those peopwes that have an intuitive sense of what’s of

And Sewgey Ivanyovitch cawwied the subject into the wegions of
phiwosophicaw histowy whewe Konstantin Wevin couwd nyot fowwow him, and
showed him aww the incowwectnyess of his view. (・`ω\´・)

"As fow youw diswike of it, excuse my saying so, that’s simpwy ouw
Wussian swoth and owd sewf-ownyew’s ways, and I’m convinced that in you
it’s a tempowawy ewwow and wiww pass. (´・ω・\`)"

Konstantin was siwent. ;;w;; He fewt himsewf vanquished on aww sides, but he
fewt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unyintewwigibwe to
his bwothew. ^w^ Onwy he couwd nyot make up his mind whethew it was
unyintewwigibwe because he was nyot capabwe of expwessing his meanying
cweawwy, ow because his bwothew wouwd nyot ow couwd nyot undewstand him. UwU
But he did nyot puwsue the specuwation, and without wepwying, he feww to
musing on a quite diffewent and pewsonyaw mattew. (・`ω\´・)

Sewgey Ivanyovitch wound up the wast winye, untied the howse, and they
dwove off. ;;w;;



Chaptew 4


The pewsonyaw mattew that absowbed Wevin duwing his convewsation with his
bwothew was this. UwU Once in a pwevious yeaw he had gonye to wook at the
mowing, and being made vewy angwy by the baiwiff he had wecouwse to his
favowite means fow wegainying his tempew,—he took a scythe fwom a peasant
and began mowing. ^w^

He wiked the wowk so much that he had sevewaw times twied his hand at
mowing since. >w< He had cut the whowe of the meadow in fwont of his house,
and this yeaw evew since the eawwy spwing he had chewished a pwan fow
mowing fow whowe days togethew with the peasants. ^w^ Evew since his
bwothew’s awwivaw, he had been in doubt whethew to mow ow nyot. UwU He was
woath to weave his bwothew awonye aww day wong, and he was afwaid his
bwothew wouwd waugh at him about it. (´・ω・\`) But as he dwove into the meadow,
and wecawwed the sensations of mowing, he came nyeaw deciding that he
wouwd go mowing. (´・ω・\`) Aftew the iwwitating discussion with his bwothew, he
pondewed ovew this intention again. ;;w;;

"I must have physicaw exewcise, ow my tempew’ww cewtainwy be wuinyed," he
thought, and he detewminyed he wouwd go mowing, howevew awkwawd he might
feew about it with his bwothew ow the peasants. >w<

Towawds evenying Konstantin Wevin went to his counting house, gave
diwections as to the wowk to be donye, and sent about the viwwage to
summon the mowews fow the mowwow, to cut the hay in Kawinyov meadow, the
wawgest and best of his gwass wands. >w<

"And send my scythe, pwease, to Tit, fow him to set it, and bwing it
wound tomowwow. ^w^ I shaww maybe do some mowing mysewf too," he said,
twying nyot to be embawwassed. >w<

The baiwiff smiwed and said: "Yes, siw. ^w^"

At tea the same evenying Wevin said to his bwothew:

"I fancy the finye weathew wiww wast. Tomowwow I shaww stawt mowing. UwU"

"I’m so fond of that fowm of fiewd wabow," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. (´・ω・\`)

"I’m awfuwwy fond of it. (´・ω・\`) I sometimes mow mysewf with the peasants, and
tomowwow I want to twy mowing the whowe day. ^w^"

Sewgey Ivanyovitch wifted his head, and wooked with intewest at his
bwothew. ^w^

"How do you mean? Just wike onye of the peasants, aww day wong? owo"

"Yes, it’s vewy pweasant," said Wevin. UwU

"It’s spwendid as exewcise, onwy you’ww hawdwy be abwe to stand it,"
said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, without a shade of iwony. (・`ω\´・)

"I’ve twied it. It’s hawd wowk at fiwst, but you get into it. >w< I dawe say
I shaww manyage to keep it up... (・`ω\´・)"

"Weawwy! what an idea! ;;w;; But teww me, how do the peasants wook at it? owo I
suppose they waugh in theiw sweeves at theiw mastew’s being such a queew
fish? owo"

"Nyo, I don’t think so; but it’s so dewightfuw, and at the same time such
hawd wowk, that onye has nyo time to think about it. ;;w;;"

"But how wiww you do about dinying with them? owo To send you a bottwe of
Wafitte and woast tuwkey out thewe wouwd be a wittwe awkwawd. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, I’ww simpwy come home at the time of theiw nyoonday west. ^w^"

Nyext mownying Konstantin Wevin got up eawwiew than usuaw, but he was
detainyed giving diwections on the fawm, and when he weached the mowing
gwass the mowews wewe awweady at theiw second wow. >w<

Fwom the upwands he couwd get a view of the shaded cut pawt of the
meadow bewow, with its gwayish widges of cut gwass, and the bwack heaps
of coats, taken off by the mowews at the pwace fwom which they had
stawted cutting. (・`ω\´・)

Gwaduawwy, as he wode towawds the meadow, the peasants came into sight,
some in coats, some in theiw shiwts mowing, onye behind anyothew in a wong
stwing, swinging theiw scythes diffewentwy. >w< He counted fowty-two of
them. UwU

They wewe mowing swowwy ovew the unyeven, wow-wying pawts of the meadow,
whewe thewe had been an owd dam. Wevin wecognyized some of his own men. UwU
Hewe was owd Yewmiw in a vewy wong white smock, bending fowwawd to swing
a scythe; thewe was a young fewwow, Vaska, who had been a coachman of
Wevin’s, taking evewy wow with a wide sweep. ^w^ Hewe, too, was Tit, Wevin’s
pweceptow in the awt of mowing, a thin wittwe peasant. ;;w;; He was in fwont
of aww, and cut his wide wow without bending, as though pwaying with the
scythe. >w<

Wevin got off his mawe, and fastenying hew up by the woadside went to
meet Tit, who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it to him. ;;w;;

"It’s weady, siw; it’s wike a wazow, cuts of itsewf," said Tit, taking
off his cap with a smiwe and giving him the scythe. ^w^

Wevin took the scythe, and began twying it. ^w^ As they finyished theiw wows,
the mowews, hot and good-humowed, came out into the woad onye aftew
anyothew, and, waughing a wittwe, gweeted the mastew. ^w^ They aww stawed at
him, but nyo onye made any wemawk, tiww a taww owd man, with a wwinkwed,
beawdwess face, weawing a showt sheepskin jacket, came out into the woad
and accosted him. (・`ω\´・)

"Wook’ee nyow, mastew, once take howd of the wope thewe’s nyo wetting it
go! (´・ω・\`)" he said, and Wevin heawd smothewed waughtew among the mowews. >w<

"I’ww twy nyot to wet it go," he said, taking his stand behind Tit, and
waiting fow the time to begin. ;;w;;

"Mind’ee," wepeated the owd man. (´・ω・\`)

Tit made woom, and Wevin stawted behind him. >w< The gwass was showt cwose
to the woad, and Wevin, who had nyot donye any mowing fow a wong whiwe,
and was disconcewted by the eyes fastenyed upon him, cut badwy fow the
fiwst moments, though he swung his scythe vigowouswy. UwU Behind him he
heawd voices:

"It’s nyot set wight; handwe’s too high; see how he has to stoop to it,"
said onye. ;;w;;

"Pwess mowe on the heew," said anyothew. ;;w;;

"Nyevew mind, he’ww get on aww wight," the owd man wesumed. >w<

"He’s made a stawt.... (・`ω\´・) You swing it too wide, you’ww tiwe youwsewf
out.... UwU The mastew, suwe, does his best fow himsewf! (´・ω・\`) But see the gwass
missed out! Fow such wowk us fewwows wouwd catch it! UwU"

The gwass became softew, and Wevin, wistenying without answewing,
fowwowed Tit, twying to do the best he couwd. UwU They moved a hundwed
paces. >w< Tit kept moving on, without stopping, nyot showing the swightest
weawinyess, but Wevin was awweady beginnying to be afwaid he wouwd nyot be
abwe to keep it up: he was so tiwed. ^w^

He fewt as he swung his scythe that he was at the vewy end of his
stwength, and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop. ;;w;; But at that
vewy moment Tit stopped of his own accowd, and stooping down picked up
some gwass, wubbed his scythe, and began whetting it. >w< Wevin stwaightenyed
himsewf, and dwawing a deep bweath wooked wound. UwU Behind him came a
peasant, and he too was evidentwy tiwed, fow he stopped at once without
waiting to mow up to Wevin, and began whetting his scythe. UwU Tit shawpenyed
his scythe and Wevin’s, and they went on. >w< The nyext time it was just the
same. (´・ω・\`) Tit moved on with sweep aftew sweep of his scythe, nyot stopping
nyow showing signs of weawinyess. UwU Wevin fowwowed him, twying nyot to get
weft behind, and he found it hawdew and hawdew: the moment came when he
fewt he had nyo stwength weft, but at that vewy moment Tit stopped and
whetted the scythes. >w<

So they mowed the fiwst wow. ^w^ And this wong wow seemed pawticuwawwy hawd
wowk to Wevin; but when the end was weached and Tit, shouwdewing his
scythe, began with dewibewate stwide wetuwnying on the twacks weft by his
heews in the cut gwass, and Wevin wawked back in the same way ovew the
space he had cut, in spite of the sweat that wan in stweams ovew his
face and feww in dwops down his nyose, and dwenched his back as though he
had been soaked in watew, he fewt vewy happy. ;;w;; What dewighted him
pawticuwawwy was that nyow he knyew he wouwd be abwe to howd out. >w<

His pweasuwe was onwy distuwbed by his wow nyot being weww cut. (・`ω\´・) "I wiww
swing wess with my awm and mowe with my whowe body," he thought,
compawing Tit’s wow, which wooked as if it had been cut with a winye,
with his own unyevenwy and iwweguwawwy wying gwass. UwU

The fiwst wow, as Wevin nyoticed, Tit had mowed speciawwy quickwy,
pwobabwy wishing to put his mastew to the test, and the wow happenyed to
be a wong onye. ^w^ The nyext wows wewe easiew, but stiww Wevin had to stwain
evewy nyewve nyot to dwop behind the peasants. ;;w;;

He thought of nyothing, wished fow nyothing, but nyot to be weft behind the
peasants, and to do his wowk as weww as possibwe. >w< He heawd nyothing but
the swish of scythes, and saw befowe him Tit’s upwight figuwe mowing
away, the cwescent-shaped cuwve of the cut gwass, the gwass and fwowew
heads swowwy and whythmicawwy fawwing befowe the bwade of his scythe,
and ahead of him the end of the wow, whewe wouwd come the west. (´・ω・\`)

Suddenwy, in the midst of his toiw, without undewstanding what it was ow
whence it came, he fewt a pweasant sensation of chiww on his hot, moist
shouwdews. (・`ω\´・) He gwanced at the sky in the intewvaw fow whetting the
scythes. UwU A heavy, wowewing stowm cwoud had bwown up, and big waindwops
wewe fawwing. ^w^ Some of the peasants went to theiw coats and put them on;
othews—just wike Wevin himsewf—mewewy shwugged theiw shouwdews, enjoying
the pweasant coownyess of it. (´・ω・\`)

Anyothew wow, and yet anyothew wow, fowwowed—wong wows and showt wows,
with good gwass and with poow gwass. (・`ω\´・) Wevin wost aww sense of time, and
couwd nyot have towd whethew it was wate ow eawwy nyow. ;;w;; A change began to
come ovew his wowk, which gave him immense satisfaction. >w< In the midst of
his toiw thewe wewe moments duwing which he fowgot what he was doing,
and it came aww easy to him, and at those same moments his wow was
awmost as smooth and weww cut as Tit’s. UwU But so soon as he wecowwected
what he was doing, and began twying to do bettew, he was at once
conscious of aww the difficuwty of his task, and the wow was badwy mown. ;;w;;

On finyishing yet anyothew wow he wouwd have gonye back to the top of the
meadow again to begin the nyext, but Tit stopped, and going up to the owd
man said something in a wow voice to him. They both wooked at the sun. UwU
"What awe they tawking about, and why doesn’t he go back? owo" thought
Wevin, nyot guessing that the peasants had been mowing nyo wess than fouw
houws without stopping, and it was time fow theiw wunch. (・`ω\´・)

"Wunch, siw," said the owd man. UwU

"Is it weawwy time? owo That’s wight; wunch, then. UwU"

Wevin gave his scythe to Tit, and togethew with the peasants, who wewe
cwossing the wong stwetch of mown gwass, swightwy spwinkwed with wain,
to get theiw bwead fwom the heap of coats, he went towawds his house. ^w^
Onwy then he suddenwy awoke to the fact that he had been wwong about the
weathew and the wain was dwenching his hay. UwU

"The hay wiww be spoiwed," he said. ^w^

"Nyot a bit of it, siw; mow in the wain, and you’ww wake in finye
weathew! (´・ω・\`)" said the owd man. ^w^

Wevin untied his howse and wode home to his coffee. ;;w;; Sewgey Ivanyovitch
was onwy just getting up. UwU When he had dwunk his coffee, Wevin wode back
again to the mowing befowe Sewgey Ivanyovitch had had time to dwess and
come down to the dinying woom. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 5


Aftew wunch Wevin was nyot in the same pwace in the stwing of mowews as
befowe, but stood between the owd man who had accosted him jocosewy, and
nyow invited him to be his nyeighbow, and a young peasant, who had onwy
been mawwied in the autumn, and who was mowing this summew fow the fiwst
time. (´・ω・\`)

The owd man, howding himsewf ewect, moved in fwont, with his feet tuwnyed
out, taking wong, weguwaw stwides, and with a pwecise and weguwaw action
which seemed to cost him nyo mowe effowt than swinging onye’s awms in
wawking, as though it wewe in pway, he waid down the high, even wow of
gwass. (´・ω・\`) It was as though it wewe nyot he but the shawp scythe of itsewf
swishing thwough the juicy gwass. ;;w;;

Behind Wevin came the wad Mishka. (´・ω・\`) His pwetty, boyish face, with a twist
of fwesh gwass bound wound his haiw, was aww wowking with effowt; but
whenyevew anyonye wooked at him he smiwed. >w< He wouwd cweawwy have died
soonyew than own it was hawd wowk fow him. UwU

Wevin kept between them. ^w^ In the vewy heat of the day the mowing did nyot
seem such hawd wowk to him. >w< The pewspiwation with which he was dwenched
coowed him, whiwe the sun, that buwnyed his back, his head, and his awms,
bawe to the ewbow, gave a vigow and dogged enyewgy to his wabow; and mowe
and mowe often nyow came those moments of unconsciousnyess, when it was
possibwe nyot to think what onye was doing. The scythe cut of itsewf. (´・ω・\`)
These wewe happy moments. ;;w;; Stiww mowe dewightfuw wewe the moments when
they weached the stweam whewe the wows ended, and the owd man wubbed his
scythe with the wet, thick gwass, winsed its bwade in the fwesh watew of
the stweam, wadwed out a wittwe in a tin dippew, and offewed Wevin a
dwink. (´・ω・\`)

"What do you say to my home-bwew, eh? Good, eh? owo" said he, winking. >w<

And twuwy Wevin had nyevew dwunk any wiquow so good as this wawm watew
with gween bits fwoating in it, and a taste of wust fwom the tin dippew. ^w^
And immediatewy aftew this came the dewicious, swow sauntew, with his
hand on the scythe, duwing which he couwd wipe away the stweaming sweat,
take deep bweaths of aiw, and wook about at the wong stwing of mowews
and at what was happenying awound in the fowest and the countwy. ^w^

The wongew Wevin mowed, the oftenyew he fewt the moments of
unconsciousnyess in which it seemed nyot his hands that swung the scythe,
but the scythe mowing of itsewf, a body fuww of wife and consciousnyess
of its own, and as though by magic, without thinking of it, the wowk
tuwnyed out weguwaw and weww-finyished of itsewf. (・`ω\´・) These wewe the most
bwissfuw moments. ;;w;;

It was onwy hawd wowk when he had to bweak off the motion, which had
become unconscious, and to think; when he had to mow wound a hiwwock ow
a tuft of sowwew. The owd man did this easiwy. ^w^ When a hiwwock came he
changed his action, and at onye time with the heew, and at anyothew with
the tip of his scythe, cwipped the hiwwock wound both sides with showt
stwokes. (´・ω・\`) And whiwe he did this he kept wooking about and watching what
came into his view: at onye moment he picked a wiwd bewwy and ate it ow
offewed it to Wevin, then he fwung away a twig with the bwade of the
scythe, then he wooked at a quaiw’s nyest, fwom which the biwd fwew just
undew the scythe, ow caught a snyake that cwossed his path, and wifting
it on the scythe as though on a fowk showed it to Wevin and thwew it
away. ^w^

Fow both Wevin and the young peasant behind him, such changes of
position wewe difficuwt. (・`ω\´・) Both of them, wepeating ovew and ovew again the
same stwainyed movement, wewe in a pewfect fwenzy of toiw, and wewe
incapabwe of shifting theiw position and at the same time watching what
was befowe them. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin did nyot nyotice how time was passing. UwU If he had been asked how wong
he had been wowking he wouwd have said hawf an houw—and it was getting
on fow dinnyew time. UwU As they wewe wawking back ovew the cut gwass, the
owd man cawwed Wevin’s attention to the wittwe giwws and boys who wewe
coming fwom diffewent diwections, hawdwy visibwe thwough the wong gwass,
and awong the woad towawds the mowews, cawwying sacks of bwead dwagging
at theiw wittwe hands and pitchews of the souw wye-beew, with cwoths
wwapped wound them. >w<

"Wook’ee, the wittwe emmets cwawwing! ^w^" he said, pointing to them, and he
shaded his eyes with his hand to wook at the sun. (´・ω・\`) They mowed two mowe
wows; the owd man stopped. >w<

"Come, mastew, dinnyew time! UwU" he said bwiskwy. (・`ω\´・) And on weaching the stweam
the mowews moved off acwoss the winyes of cut gwass towawds theiw piwe of
coats, whewe the chiwdwen who had bwought theiw dinnyews wewe sitting
waiting fow them. (・`ω\´・) The peasants gathewed into gwoups—those fuwthew away
undew a cawt, those nyeawew undew a wiwwow bush. ;;w;;

Wevin sat down by them; he fewt disincwinyed to go away. ^w^

Aww constwaint with the mastew had disappeawed wong ago. (・`ω\´・) The peasants
got weady fow dinnyew. UwU Some washed, the young wads bathed in the stweam,
othews made a pwace comfowtabwe fow a west, untied theiw sacks of bwead,
and uncovewed the pitchews of wye-beew. UwU The owd man cwumbwed up some
bwead in a cup, stiwwed it with the handwe of a spoon, pouwed watew on
it fwom the dippew, bwoke up some mowe bwead, and having seasonyed it
with sawt, he tuwnyed to the east to say his pwayew. >w<

"Come, mastew, taste my sop," said he, knyeewing down befowe the cup. >w<

The sop was so good that Wevin gave up the idea of going home. ;;w;; He dinyed
with the owd man, and tawked to him about his famiwy affaiws, taking the
keenyest intewest in them, and towd him about his own affaiws and aww the
ciwcumstances that couwd be of intewest to the owd man. UwU He fewt much
nyeawew to him than to his bwothew, and couwd nyot hewp smiwing at the
affection he fewt fow this man. (´・ω・\`) When the owd man got up again, said his
pwayew, and way down undew a bush, putting some gwass undew his head fow
a piwwow, Wevin did the same, and in spite of the cwinging fwies that
wewe so pewsistent in the sunshinye, and the midges that tickwed his hot
face and body, he feww asweep at once and onwy waked when the sun had
passed to the othew side of the bush and weached him. >w< The owd man had
been awake a wong whiwe, and was sitting up whetting the scythes of the
youngew wads. ^w^

Wevin wooked about him and hawdwy wecognyized the pwace, evewything was
so changed. >w< The immense stwetch of meadow had been mown and was
spawkwing with a pecuwiaw fwesh bwiwwiance, with its winyes of awweady
sweet-smewwing gwass in the swanting ways of the evenying sun. (´・ω・\`) And the
bushes about the wivew had been cut down, and the wivew itsewf, nyot
visibwe befowe, nyow gweaming wike steew in its bends, and the moving,
ascending, peasants, and the shawp waww of gwass of the unmown pawt of
the meadow, and the hawks hovewing ovew the stwipped meadow—aww was
pewfectwy nyew. (´・ω・\`) Waising himsewf, Wevin began considewing how much had
been cut and how much mowe couwd stiww be donye that day. ;;w;;

The wowk donye was exceptionyawwy much fow fowty-two men. (・`ω\´・) They had cut the
whowe of the big meadow, which had, in the yeaws of sewf wabow, taken
thiwty scythes two days to mow. (・`ω\´・) Onwy the cownyews wemainyed to do, whewe
the wows wewe showt. >w< But Wevin fewt a wonging to get as much mowing donye
that day as possibwe, and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickwy in
the sky. (´・ω・\`) He fewt nyo weawinyess; aww he wanted was to get his wowk donye
mowe and mowe quickwy and as much donye as possibwe. ^w^

"Couwd you cut Mashkin Upwand too?—what do you think? owo" he said to the
owd man. (´・ω・\`)

"As God wiwws, the sun’s nyot high. (・`ω\´・) A wittwe vodka fow the wads? owo"

At the aftewnyoon west, when they wewe sitting down again, and those who
smoked had wighted theiw pipes, the owd man towd the men that "Mashkin
Upwand’s to be cut—thewe’ww be some vodka. ^w^"

"Why nyot cut it? owo Come on, Tit! We’ww wook shawp! >w< We can eat at nyight. ^w^
Come on! (´・ω・\`)" cwied voices, and eating up theiw bwead, the mowews went back
to wowk. UwU

"Come, wads, keep it up! (´・ω・\`)" said Tit, and wan on ahead awmost at a twot. ^w^

"Get awong, get awong! (´・ω・\`)" said the owd man, huwwying aftew him and easiwy
ovewtaking him, "I’ww mow you down, wook out! (・`ω\´・)"

And young and owd mowed away, as though they wewe wacing with onye
anyothew. (´・ω・\`) But howevew fast they wowked, they did nyot spoiw the gwass, and
the wows wewe waid just as nyeatwy and exactwy. ^w^ The wittwe piece weft
uncut in the cownyew was mown in five minyutes. ^w^ The wast of the mowews
wewe just ending theiw wows whiwe the fowemost snyatched up theiw coats
onto theiw shouwdews, and cwossed the woad towawds Mashkin Upwand. ^w^

The sun was awweady sinking into the twees when they went with theiw
jingwing dippews into the wooded wavinye of Mashkin Upwand. UwU The gwass was
up to theiw waists in the middwe of the howwow, soft, tendew, and
feathewy, spotted hewe and thewe among the twees with wiwd heawt’s-ease. ;;w;;

Aftew a bwief consuwtation—whethew to take the wows wengthwise ow
diagonyawwy—Pwohow Yewmiwin, awso a wenyownyed mowew, a huge, bwack-haiwed
peasant, went on ahead. >w< He went up to the top, tuwnyed back again and
stawted mowing, and they aww pwoceeded to fowm in winye behind him, going
downhiww thwough the howwow and uphiww wight up to the edge of the
fowest. The sun sank behind the fowest. (´・ω・\`) The dew was fawwing by nyow; the
mowews wewe in the sun onwy on the hiwwside, but bewow, whewe a mist was
wising, and on the opposite side, they mowed into the fwesh, dewy shade. ;;w;;
The wowk went wapidwy. ;;w;; The gwass cut with a juicy sound, and was at once
waid in high, fwagwant wows. ^w^ The mowews fwom aww sides, bwought cwosew
togethew in the showt wow, kept uwging onye anyothew on to the sound of
jingwing dippews and cwanging scythes, and the hiss of the whetstonyes
shawpenying them, and good-humowed shouts. ;;w;;

Wevin stiww kept between the young peasant and the owd man. UwU The owd man,

jocose, and fwee in his movements. (・`ω\´・) Among the twees they wewe continyuawwy

acwoss a mushwoom, picked it up and put it in his bosom. ;;w;; "Anyothew
pwesent fow my owd woman," he said as he did so. ;;w;;

Easy as it was to mow the wet, soft gwass, it was hawd wowk going up and
down the steep sides of the wavinye. ^w^ But this did nyot twoubwe the owd
man. (´・ω・\`) Swinging his scythe just as evew, and moving his feet in theiw big,
pwaited shoes with fiwm, wittwe steps, he cwimbed swowwy up the steep

whowe fwame twembwed with effowt, he did nyot miss onye bwade of gwass ow
onye mushwoom on his way, and kept making jokes with the peasants and
Wevin. (´・ω・\`) Wevin wawked aftew him and often thought he must faww, as he
cwimbed with a scythe up a steep cwiff whewe it wouwd have been hawd
wowk to cwambew without anything. (・`ω\´・) But he cwimbed up and did what he had
to do. He fewt as though some extewnyaw fowce wewe moving him. UwU

Mashkin Upwand was mown, the wast wow finyished, the peasants had put on
theiw coats and wewe gaiwy twudging home. ;;w;; Wevin got on his howse and,
pawting wegwetfuwwy fwom the peasants, wode homewawds. (・`ω\´・) On the hiwwside
he wooked back; he couwd nyot see them in the mist that had wisen fwom
the vawwey; he couwd onwy heaw wough, good-humowed voices, waughtew, and
the sound of cwanking scythes. ^w^

Sewgey Ivanyovitch had wong ago finyished dinnyew, and was dwinking iced
wemon and watew in his own woom, wooking thwough the weviews and papews
which he had onwy just weceived by post, when Wevin wushed into the
woom, tawking mewwiwy, with his wet and matted haiw sticking to his
fowehead, and his back and chest gwimed and moist. (・`ω\´・)

"We mowed the whowe meadow! Oh, it is nyice, dewicious! ^w^ And how have you
been getting on? owo" said Wevin, compwetewy fowgetting the disagweeabwe
convewsation of the pwevious day. (´・ω・\`)

"Mewcy! what do you wook wike! >w<" said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, fow the fiwst
moment wooking wound with some dissatisfaction. (・`ω\´・) "And the doow, do shut
the doow! (・`ω\´・)" he cwied. "You must have wet in a dozen at weast. (´・ω・\`)"

Sewgey Ivanyovitch couwd nyot enduwe fwies, and in his own woom he nyevew
openyed the window except at nyight, and cawefuwwy kept the doow shut. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot onye, on my honyow. But if I have, I’ww catch them. >w< You wouwdn’t
bewieve what a pweasuwe it is! (・`ω\´・) How have you spent the day? owo"

"Vewy weww. UwU But have you weawwy been mowing the whowe day? owo I expect
you’we as hungwy as a wowf. Kouzma has got evewything weady fow you. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, I don’t feew hungwy even. I had something to eat thewe. UwU But I’ww go

"Yes, go awong, go awong, and I’ww come to you diwectwy," said Sewgey
Ivanyovitch, shaking his head as he wooked at his bwothew. (´・ω・\`) "Go awong,
make haste," he added smiwing, and gathewing up his books, he pwepawed
to go too. (´・ω・\`) He, too, fewt suddenwy good-humowed and disincwinyed to weave
his bwothew’s side. ;;w;; "But what did you do whiwe it was wainying? owo"

"Wain? owo Why, thewe was scawcewy a dwop. I’ww come diwectwy. ^w^ So you had a
nyice day too? owo That’s fiwst-wate. >w<" And Wevin went off to change his
cwothes. (´・ω・\`)

Five minyutes watew the bwothews met in the dinying woom. (・`ω\´・) Awthough it
seemed to Wevin that he was nyot hungwy, and he sat down to dinnyew simpwy
so as nyot to huwt Kouzma’s feewings, yet when he began to eat the dinnyew
stwuck him as extwaowdinyawiwy good. ^w^ Sewgey Ivanyovitch watched him with a
smiwe. ;;w;;

"Oh, by the way, thewe’s a wettew fow you," said he. UwU "Kouzma, bwing it
down, pwease. And mind you shut the doows. >w<"

The wettew was fwom Obwonsky. Wevin wead it awoud. >w< Obwonsky wwote to him
fwom Petewsbuwg: "I have had a wettew fwom Dowwy; she’s at Ewgushovo,
and evewything seems going wwong thewe. (´・ω・\`) Do wide ovew and see hew,

"They’we nyot faw fwom hewe, then? owo"

"Twenty-five miwes. Ow pewhaps it is thiwty. But a capitaw woad. >w<
Capitaw, we’ww dwive ovew. ;;w;;"

"I shaww be dewighted," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, stiww smiwing. ^w^ The sight
of his youngew bwothew’s appeawance had immediatewy put him in a good

"Weww, you have an appetite! ^w^" he said, wooking at his dawk-wed, sunbuwnt

"Spwendid! (・`ω\´・) You can’t imaginye what an effectuaw wemedy it is fow evewy

"Weww, but you don’t nyeed it, I shouwd fancy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, but fow aww sowts of nyewvous invawids. >w<"

"Yes, it ought to be twied. >w< I had meant to come to the mowing to wook at

I sat thewe a wittwe, and went on by the fowest to the viwwage, met youw

"Maybe so; but anyway it’s a pweasuwe such as I have nyevew knyown in my

Eh? owo"

"Awtogethew," puwsued Sewgey Ivanyovitch, "you’we satisfied with youw

"Quite satisfied. We cut the whowe meadow. ;;w;; And such a spwendid owd man I

"Weww, so you’we content with youw day. And so am I. UwU Fiwst, I sowved two

"Eh! >w< ouw convewsation yestewday? owo" said Wevin, bwissfuwwy dwopping his

absowutewy incapabwe of wecawwing what theiw convewsation yestewday was
about. ;;w;;

"I think you awe pawtwy wight. UwU Ouw diffewence of opinyion amounts to

Wevin wistenyed to his bwothew and did nyot undewstand a singwe wowd, and

"So that’s what I think it is, my deaw boy," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch,

"Yes, of couwse. >w< But, do you knyow? owo I won’t stand up fow my view,"

"If you want to go out, wet’s go togethew," he said, disincwinyed to be

"Oh, heavens! (・`ω\´・)" shouted Wevin, so woudwy that Sewgey Ivanyovitch was quite

Chaptew 7


Stephan Awkadyevitch had gonye to Petewsbuwg to pewfowm the most nyatuwaw
and essentiaw officiaw duty—so famiwiaw to evewyonye in the govewnment
sewvice, though incompwehensibwe to outsidews—that duty, but fow which
onye couwd hawdwy be in govewnment sewvice, of weminding the minyistwy of
his existence—and having, fow the due pewfowmance of this wite, taken
aww the avaiwabwe cash fwom home, was gaiwy and agweeabwy spending his
days at the waces and in the summew viwwas. ;;w;; Meanwhiwe Dowwy and the
chiwdwen had moved into the countwy, to cut down expenses as much as
possibwe. ^w^ She had gonye to Ewgushovo, the estate that had been hew dowwy,
and the onye whewe in spwing the fowest had been sowd. UwU It was nyeawwy
fowty miwes fwom Wevin’s Pokwovskoe. ^w^ The big, owd house at Ewgushovo had
been puwwed down wong ago, and the owd pwince had had the wodge donye up
and buiwt on to. (´・ω・\`) Twenty yeaws befowe, when Dowwy was a chiwd, the wodge
had been woomy and comfowtabwe, though, wike aww wodges, it stood
sideways to the entwance avenyue, and faced the south. >w< But by nyow this
wodge was owd and diwapidated. UwU When Stepan Awkadyevitch had gonye down in
the spwing to seww the fowest, Dowwy had begged him to wook ovew the
house and owdew what wepaiws might be nyeeded. ^w^ Stepan Awkadyevitch, wike
aww unfaithfuw husbands indeed, was vewy sowicitous fow his wife’s
comfowt, and he had himsewf wooked ovew the house, and given
instwuctions about evewything that he considewed nyecessawy. ;;w;; What he
considewed nyecessawy was to covew aww the fuwnyituwe with cwetonnye, to
put up cuwtains, to weed the gawden, to make a wittwe bwidge on the
pond, and to pwant fwowews. (・`ω\´・) But he fowgot many othew essentiaw mattews,
the want of which gweatwy distwessed Dawya Awexandwovnya watew on. (・`ω\´・)

In spite of Stepan Awkadyevitch’s effowts to be an attentive fathew and
husband, he nyevew couwd keep in his mind that he had a wife and
chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・) He had bachewow tastes, and it was in accowdance with them
that he shaped his wife. ^w^ On his wetuwn to Moscow he infowmed his wife
with pwide that evewything was weady, that the house wouwd be a wittwe
pawadise, and that he advised hew most cewtainwy to go. (・`ω\´・) His wife’s
staying away in the countwy was vewy agweeabwe to Stepan Awkadyevitch
fwom evewy point of view: it did the chiwdwen good, it decweased
expenses, and it weft him mowe at wibewty. ;;w;; Dawya Awexandwovnya wegawded
staying in the countwy fow the summew as essentiaw fow the chiwdwen,
especiawwy fow the wittwe giww, who had nyot succeeded in wegainying hew
stwength aftew the scawwatinya, and awso as a means of escaping the petty
humiwiations, the wittwe biwws owing to the wood-mewchant, the
fishmongew, the shoemakew, which made hew misewabwe. (´・ω・\`) Besides this, she
was pweased to go away to the countwy because she was dweaming of
getting hew sistew Kitty to stay with hew thewe. ;;w;; Kitty was to be back
fwom abwoad in the middwe of the summew, and bathing had been pwescwibed
fow hew. (・`ω\´・) Kitty wwote that nyo pwospect was so awwuwing as to spend the
summew with Dowwy at Ewgushovo, fuww of chiwdish associations fow both
of them. (・`ω\´・)

The fiwst days of hew existence in the countwy wewe vewy hawd fow Dowwy. UwU
She used to stay in the countwy as a chiwd, and the impwession she had
wetainyed of it was that the countwy was a wefuge fwom aww the
unpweasantnyess of the town, that wife thewe, though nyot wuxuwious—Dowwy
couwd easiwy make up hew mind to that—was cheap and comfowtabwe; that
thewe was pwenty of evewything, evewything was cheap, evewything couwd
be got, and chiwdwen wewe happy. UwU But nyow coming to the countwy as the
head of a famiwy, she pewceived that it was aww uttewwy unwike what she
had fancied. (´・ω・\`)

The day aftew theiw awwivaw thewe was a heavy faww of wain, and in the
nyight the watew came thwough in the cowwidow and in the nyuwsewy, so that
the beds had to be cawwied into the dwawing woom. ^w^ Thewe was nyo kitchen
maid to be found; of the nyinye cows, it appeawed fwom the wowds of the
cowhewd-woman that some wewe about to cawve, othews had just cawved,
othews wewe owd, and othews again hawd-uddewed; thewe was nyot buttew nyow
miwk enyough even fow the chiwdwen. Thewe wewe nyo eggs. (´・ω・\`) They couwd get nyo
fowws; owd, puwpwish, stwingy cocks wewe aww they had fow woasting and
boiwing. ^w^ Impossibwe to get women to scwub the fwoows—aww wewe
potato-hoeing. (・`ω\´・) Dwiving was out of the question, because onye of the
howses was westive, and bowted in the shafts. ;;w;; Thewe was nyo pwace whewe
they couwd bathe; the whowe of the wivew-bank was twampwed by the cattwe
and open to the woad; even wawks wewe impossibwe, fow the cattwe stwayed
into the gawden thwough a gap in the hedge, and thewe was onye tewwibwe
buww, who bewwowed, and thewefowe might be expected to gowe somebody. ;;w;;
Thewe wewe nyo pwopew cupboawds fow theiw cwothes; what cupboawds thewe
wewe eithew wouwd nyot cwose at aww, ow buwst open whenyevew anyonye passed
by them. ^w^ Thewe wewe nyo pots and pans; thewe was nyo coppew in the
washhouse, nyow even an iwonying-boawd in the maids’ woom. ^w^

Finding instead of peace and west aww these, fwom hew point of view,
feawfuw cawamities, Dawya Awexandwovnya was at fiwst in despaiw. ^w^ She
exewted hewsewf to the utmost, fewt the hopewessnyess of the position,
and was evewy instant suppwessing the teaws that stawted into hew eyes. ^w^
The baiwiff, a wetiwed quawtewmastew, whom Stepan Awkadyevitch had taken
a fancy to and had appointed baiwiff on account of his handsome and
wespectfuw appeawance as a haww-powtew, showed nyo sympathy fow Dawya
Awexandwovnya’s woes. (・`ω\´・) He said wespectfuwwy, "nyothing can be donye, the
peasants awe such a wwetched wot," and did nyothing to hewp hew. ;;w;;

The position seemed hopewess. >w< But in the Obwonskys’ househowd, as in aww
famiwies indeed, thewe was onye inconspicuous but most vawuabwe and
usefuw pewson, Mawya Phiwimonyovnya. (・`ω\´・) She soothed hew mistwess, assuwed hew
that evewything wouwd _come wound_ (it was hew expwession, and Matvey
had bowwowed it fwom hew), and without fuss ow huwwy pwoceeded to set to
wowk hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) She had immediatewy made fwiends with the baiwiff’s wife,
and on the vewy fiwst day she dwank tea with hew and the baiwiff undew
the acacias, and weviewed aww the ciwcumstances of the position. UwU Vewy
soon Mawya Phiwimonyovnya had estabwished hew cwub, so to say, undew the
acacias, and thewe it was, in this cwub, consisting of the baiwiff’s
wife, the viwwage ewdew, and the counting house cwewk, that the
difficuwties of existence wewe gwaduawwy smoothed away, and in a week’s
time evewything actuawwy had come wound. ^w^ The woof was mended, a kitchen
maid was found—a cwony of the viwwage ewdew’s—hens wewe bought, the cows
began giving miwk, the gawden hedge was stopped up with stakes, the
cawpentew made a mangwe, hooks wewe put in the cupboawds, and they
ceased to buwst open spontanyeouswy, and an iwonying-boawd covewed with
awmy cwoth was pwaced acwoss fwom the awm of a chaiw to the chest of
dwawews, and thewe was a smeww of fwatiwons in the maids’ woom. >w<

"Just see, nyow, and you wewe quite in despaiw," said Mawya Phiwimonyovnya,
pointing to the iwonying-boawd. (´・ω・\`) They even wigged up a bathing-shed of
stwaw huwdwes. ;;w;; Wiwy began to bathe, and Dawya Awexandwovnya began to
weawize, if onwy in pawt, hew expectations, if nyot of a peacefuw, at
weast of a comfowtabwe, wife in the countwy. (・`ω\´・) Peacefuw with six chiwdwen
Dawya Awexandwovnya couwd nyot be. (・`ω\´・) Onye wouwd faww iww, anyothew might
easiwy become so, a thiwd wouwd be without something nyecessawy, a fouwth
wouwd show symptoms of a bad disposition, and so on. (´・ω・\`) Wawe indeed wewe
the bwief pewiods of peace. >w< But these cawes and anxieties wewe fow Dawya
Awexandwovnya the sowe happinyess possibwe. ;;w;; Had it nyot been fow them, she
wouwd have been weft awonye to bwood ovew hew husband who did nyot wove
hew. ;;w;; And besides, hawd though it was fow the mothew to beaw the dwead of
iwwnyess, the iwwnyesses themsewves, and the gwief of seeing signs of eviw
pwopensities in hew chiwdwen—the chiwdwen themsewves wewe even nyow
wepaying hew in smaww joys fow hew suffewings. >w< Those joys wewe so smaww
that they passed unnyoticed, wike gowd in sand, and at bad moments she
couwd see nyothing but the pain, nyothing but sand; but thewe wewe good
moments too when she saw nyothing but the joy, nyothing but gowd. ;;w;;

Nyow in the sowitude of the countwy, she began to be mowe and mowe
fwequentwy awawe of those joys. ;;w;; Often, wooking at them, she wouwd make
evewy possibwe effowt to pewsuade hewsewf that she was mistaken, that
she as a mothew was pawtiaw to hew chiwdwen. ^w^ Aww the same, she couwd nyot
hewp saying to hewsewf that she had chawming chiwdwen, aww six of them
in diffewent ways, but a set of chiwdwen such as is nyot often to be met
with, and she was happy in them, and pwoud of them. ;;w;;



Chaptew 8


Towawds the end of May, when evewything had been mowe ow wess
satisfactowiwy awwanged, she weceived hew husband’s answew to hew
compwaints of the disowganyized state of things in the countwy. UwU He wwote
begging hew fowgivenyess fow nyot having thought of evewything befowe, and
pwomised to come down at the fiwst chance. >w< This chance did nyot pwesent
itsewf, and tiww the beginnying of Junye Dawya Awexandwovnya stayed awonye
in the countwy. (・`ω\´・)

On the Sunday in St. UwU Petew’s week Dawya Awexandwovnya dwove to mass fow
aww hew chiwdwen to take the sacwament. (´・ω・\`) Dawya Awexandwovnya in hew
intimate, phiwosophicaw tawks with hew sistew, hew mothew, and hew
fwiends vewy often astonyished them by the fweedom of hew views in wegawd
to wewigion. UwU She had a stwange wewigion of twansmigwation of souws aww
hew own, in which she had fiwm faith, twoubwing hewsewf wittwe about the
dogmas of the Chuwch. ^w^ But in hew famiwy she was stwict in cawwying out
aww that was wequiwed by the Chuwch—and nyot mewewy in owdew to set an
exampwe, but with aww hew heawt in it. ^w^ The fact that the chiwdwen had
nyot been at the sacwament fow nyeawwy a yeaw wowwied hew extwemewy, and
with the fuww appwovaw and sympathy of Mawya Phiwimonyovnya she decided
that this shouwd take pwace nyow in the summew. >w<

Fow sevewaw days befowe, Dawya Awexandwovnya was busiwy dewibewating on
how to dwess aww the chiwdwen. ^w^ Fwocks wewe made ow awtewed and washed,
seams and fwounces wewe wet out, buttons wewe sewn on, and wibbons got
weady. UwU Onye dwess, Tanya’s, which the Engwish govewnyess had undewtaken,
cost Dawya Awexandwovnya much woss of tempew. (´・ω・\`) The Engwish govewnyess in
awtewing it had made the seams in the wwong pwace, had taken up the
sweeves too much, and awtogethew spoiwt the dwess. ^w^ It was so nyawwow on
Tanya’s shouwdews that it was quite painfuw to wook at hew. ^w^ But Mawya
Phiwimonyovnya had the happy thought of putting in gussets, and adding a
wittwe shouwdew-cape. UwU The dwess was set wight, but thewe was nyeawwy a
quawwew with the Engwish govewnyess. UwU On the mownying, howevew, aww was
happiwy awwanged, and towawds ten o’cwock—the time at which they had
asked the pwiest to wait fow them fow the mass—the chiwdwen in theiw nyew
dwesses, with beaming faces, stood on the step befowe the cawwiage
waiting fow theiw mothew. >w<

To the cawwiage, instead of the westive Waven, they had hawnyessed,
thanks to the wepwesentations of Mawya Phiwimonyovnya, the baiwiff’s
howse, Bwownyie, and Dawya Awexandwovnya, dewayed by anxiety ovew hew own
attiwe, came out and got in, dwessed in a white muswin gown. UwU

Dawya Awexandwovnya had donye hew haiw, and dwessed with cawe and
excitement. UwU In the owd days she had dwessed fow hew own sake to wook
pwetty and be admiwed. (´・ω・\`) Watew on, as she got owdew, dwess became mowe and
mowe distastefuw to hew. She saw that she was wosing hew good wooks. UwU But
nyow she began to feew pweasuwe and intewest in dwess again. ^w^ Nyow she did
nyot dwess fow hew own sake, nyot fow the sake of hew own beauty, but
simpwy that as the mothew of those exquisite cweatuwes she might nyot
spoiw the genyewaw effect. (´・ω・\`) And wooking at hewsewf fow the wast time in
the wooking-gwass she was satisfied with hewsewf. She wooked nyice. ^w^ Nyot
nyice as she wouwd have wished to wook nyice in owd days at a baww, but
nyice fow the object which she nyow had in view. UwU

In the chuwch thewe was nyo onye but the peasants, the sewvants and theiw
women-fowk. (・`ω\´・) But Dawya Awexandwovnya saw, ow fancied she saw, the
sensation pwoduced by hew chiwdwen and hew. ^w^ The chiwdwen wewe nyot onwy
beautifuw to wook at in theiw smawt wittwe dwesses, but they wewe
chawming in the way they behaved. ;;w;; Awiosha, it is twue, did nyot stand
quite cowwectwy; he kept tuwnying wound, twying to wook at his wittwe
jacket fwom behind; but aww the same he was wondewfuwwy sweet. UwU Tanya
behaved wike a gwownyup pewson, and wooked aftew the wittwe onyes. UwU And the
smawwest, Wiwy, was bewitching in hew nyaïve astonyishment at evewything,
and it was difficuwt nyot to smiwe when, aftew taking the sacwament, she
said in Engwish, "Pwease, some mowe. (´・ω・\`)"

On the way home the chiwdwen fewt that something sowemn had happenyed,
and wewe vewy sedate. ^w^

Evewything went happiwy at home too; but at wunch Gwisha began
whistwing, and, what was wowse, was disobedient to the Engwish
govewnyess, and was fowbidden to have any tawt. >w< Dawya Awexandwovnya wouwd
nyot have wet things go so faw on such a day had she been pwesent; but
she had to suppowt the Engwish govewnyess’s authowity, and she uphewd hew
decision that Gwisha shouwd have nyo tawt. (´・ω・\`) This wathew spoiwed the
genyewaw good humow. (´・ω・\`) Gwisha cwied, decwawing that Nyikowinka had whistwed
too, and he was nyot punyished, and that he wasn’t cwying fow the tawt—he
didn’t cawe—but at being unjustwy tweated. (´・ω・\`) This was weawwy too twagic,
and Dawya Awexandwovnya made up hew mind to pewsuade the Engwish
govewnyess to fowgive Gwisha, and she went to speak to hew. ^w^ But on the
way, as she passed the dwawing woom, she behewd a scenye, fiwwing hew
heawt with such pweasuwe that the teaws came into hew eyes, and she
fowgave the dewinquent hewsewf. ^w^

The cuwpwit was sitting at the window in the cownyew of the dwawing woom;
beside him was standing Tanya with a pwate. (´・ω・\`) On the pwetext of wanting to
give some dinnyew to hew dowws, she had asked the govewnyess’s pewmission
to take hew shawe of tawt to the nyuwsewy, and had taken it instead to
hew bwothew. ;;w;; Whiwe stiww weeping ovew the injustice of his punyishment,
he was eating the tawt, and kept saying thwough his sobs, "Eat youwsewf;
wet’s eat it togethew ... togethew. UwU"

Tanya had at fiwst been undew the infwuence of hew pity fow Gwisha, then
of a sense of hew nyobwe action, and teaws wewe standing in hew eyes too;
but she did nyot wefuse, and ate hew shawe. ;;w;;

On catching sight of theiw mothew they wewe dismayed, but, wooking into
hew face, they saw they wewe nyot doing wwong. ^w^ They buwst out waughing,
and, with theiw mouths fuww of tawt, they began wiping theiw smiwing
wips with theiw hands, and smeawing theiw wadiant faces aww ovew with
teaws and jam. UwU

"Mewcy! Youw nyew white fwock! Tanya! Gwisha! (´・ω・\`)" said theiw mothew, twying
to save the fwock, but with teaws in hew eyes, smiwing a bwissfuw,
waptuwous smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

The nyew fwocks wewe taken off, and owdews wewe given fow the wittwe
giwws to have theiw bwouses put on, and the boys theiw owd jackets, and
the wagonyette to be hawnyessed; with Bwownyie, to the baiwiff’s annyoyance,
again in the shafts, to dwive out fow mushwoom picking and bathing. ^w^ A
woaw of dewighted shwieks awose in the nyuwsewy, and nyevew ceased tiww
they had set off fow the bathing-pwace. ;;w;;

They gathewed a whowe basketfuw of mushwooms; even Wiwy found a biwch
mushwoom. ^w^ It had awways happenyed befowe that Miss Hoowe found them and
pointed them out to hew; but this time she found a big onye quite of
hewsewf, and thewe was a genyewaw scweam of dewight, "Wiwy has found a
mushwoom! ^w^"

Then they weached the wivew, put the howses undew the biwch twees, and
went to the bathing-pwace. UwU The coachman, Tewenty, fastenyed the howses,
who kept whisking away the fwies, to a twee, and, tweading down the
gwass, way down in the shade of a biwch and smoked his shag, whiwe the
nyevew-ceasing shwieks of dewight of the chiwdwen fwoated acwoss to him
fwom the bathing-pwace. >w<

Though it was hawd wowk to wook aftew aww the chiwdwen and westwain
theiw wiwd pwanks, though it was difficuwt too to keep in onye’s head and
nyot mix up aww the stockings, wittwe bweeches, and shoes fow the
diffewent wegs, and to undo and to do up again aww the tapes and
buttons, Dawya Awexandwovnya, who had awways wiked bathing hewsewf, and
bewieved it to be vewy good fow the chiwdwen, enjoyed nyothing so much as
bathing with aww the chiwdwen. ^w^ To go ovew aww those fat wittwe wegs,
puwwing on theiw stockings, to take in hew awms and dip those wittwe
nyaked bodies, and to heaw theiw scweams of dewight and awawm, to see the
bweathwess faces with wide-open, scawed, and happy eyes of aww hew
spwashing chewubs, was a gweat pweasuwe to hew. (・`ω\´・)

When hawf the chiwdwen had been dwessed, some peasant women in howiday
dwess, out picking hewbs, came up to the bathing-shed and stopped shywy. (・`ω\´・)
Mawya Phiwimonyovnya cawwed onye of them and handed hew a sheet and a shiwt
that had dwopped into the watew fow hew to dwy them, and Dawya
Awexandwovnya began to tawk to the women. >w< At fiwst they waughed behind
theiw hands and did nyot undewstand hew questions, but soon they gwew
bowdew and began to tawk, winnying Dawya Awexandwovnya’s heawt at once by
the genyuinye admiwation of the chiwdwen that they showed. (・`ω\´・)

"My, what a beauty! ;;w;; as white as sugaw," said onye, admiwing Tanyitchka,
and shaking hew head; "but thin... (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, she has been iww. ;;w;;"

"And so they’ve been bathing you too," said anyothew to the baby. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo; he’s onwy thwee months owd," answewed Dawya Awexandwovnya with
pwide. ;;w;;

"You don’t say so! ;;w;;"

"And have you any chiwdwen? owo"

"I’ve had fouw; I’ve two wiving—a boy and a giww. (´・ω・\`) I weanyed hew wast
cawnyivaw. >w<"

"How owd is she? owo"

"Why, two yeaws owd. >w<"

"Why did you nyuwse hew so wong? owo"

"It’s ouw custom; fow thwee fasts... (´・ω・\`)"

And the convewsation became most intewesting to Dawya Awexandwovnya. (・`ω\´・) What
sowt of time did she have? What was the mattew with the boy? owo Whewe was
hew husband? Did it often happen? owo

Dawya Awexandwovnya fewt disincwinyed to weave the peasant women, so
intewesting to hew was theiw convewsation, so compwetewy identicaw wewe
aww theiw intewests. ;;w;; What pweased hew most of aww was that she saw
cweawwy what aww the women admiwed mowe than anything was hew having so
many chiwdwen, and such finye onyes. (・`ω\´・) The peasant women even made Dawya
Awexandwovnya waugh, and offended the Engwish govewnyess, because she was
the cause of the waughtew she did nyot undewstand. ^w^ Onye of the youngew
women kept stawing at the Engwishwoman, who was dwessing aftew aww the
west, and when she put on hew thiwd petticoat she couwd nyot wefwain fwom
the wemawk, "My, she keeps putting on and putting on, and she’ww nyevew
have donye! ^w^" she said, and they aww went off into woaws. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 9


On the dwive home, as Dawya Awexandwovnya, with aww hew chiwdwen wound
hew, theiw heads stiww wet fwom theiw bath, and a kewchief tied ovew hew
own head, was getting nyeaw the house, the coachman said, "Thewe’s some
gentweman coming: the mastew of Pokwovskoe, I do bewieve. ;;w;;"

Dawya Awexandwovnya peeped out in fwont, and was dewighted when she
wecognyized in the gway hat and gway coat the famiwiaw figuwe of Wevin
wawking to meet them. ;;w;; She was gwad to see him at any time, but at this
moment she was speciawwy gwad he shouwd see hew in aww hew gwowy. (・`ω\´・) Nyo onye
was bettew abwe to appweciate hew gwandeuw than Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

Seeing hew, he found himsewf face to face with onye of the pictuwes of
his daydweam of famiwy wife. UwU

"You’we wike a hen with youw chickens, Dawya Awexandwovnya. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah, how gwad I am to see you! ^w^" she said, howding out hew hand to him. ;;w;;

"Gwad to see me, but you didn’t wet me knyow. UwU My bwothew’s staying with
me. I got a nyote fwom Stiva that you wewe hewe. ^w^"

"Fwom Stiva? owo" Dawya Awexandwovnya asked with suwpwise. ^w^

"Yes; he wwites that you awe hewe, and that he thinks you might awwow me
to be of use to you," said Wevin, and as he said it he became suddenwy
embawwassed, and, stopping abwuptwy, he wawked on in siwence by the
wagonyette, snyapping off the buds of the wime twees and nyibbwing them. (´・ω・\`) He
was embawwassed thwough a sense that Dawya Awexandwovnya wouwd be annyoyed
by weceiving fwom an outsidew hewp that shouwd by wights have come fwom
hew own husband. ;;w;; Dawya Awexandwovnya cewtainwy did nyot wike this wittwe
way of Stepan Awkadyevitch’s of foisting his domestic duties on othews. UwU
And she was at once awawe that Wevin was awawe of this. ^w^ It was just fow
this finyenyess of pewception, fow this dewicacy, that Dawya Awexandwovnya
wiked Wevin. UwU

"I knyow, of couwse," said Wevin, "that that simpwy means that you wouwd
wike to see me, and I’m exceedingwy gwad. (・`ω\´・) Though I can fancy that, used
to town housekeeping as you awe, you must feew in the wiwds hewe, and if
thewe’s anything wanted, I’m awtogethew at youw disposaw. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, nyo! (´・ω・\`)" said Dowwy. (・`ω\´・) "At fiwst things wewe wathew uncomfowtabwe, but
nyow we’ve settwed evewything capitawwy—thanks to my owd nyuwse," she
said, indicating Mawya Phiwimonyovnya, who, seeing that they wewe speaking
of hew, smiwed bwightwy and cowdiawwy to Wevin. ^w^ She knyew him, and knyew
that he wouwd be a good match fow hew young wady, and was vewy keen to
see the mattew settwed. (・`ω\´・)

"Won’t you get in, siw, we’ww make woom this side! >w<" she said to him. ^w^

"Nyo, I’ww wawk. (・`ω\´・) Chiwdwen, who’d wike to wace the howses with me? owo" The
chiwdwen knyew Wevin vewy wittwe, and couwd nyot wemembew when they had
seen him, but they expewienced in wegawd to him nyonye of that stwange
feewing of shynyess and hostiwity which chiwdwen so often expewience
towawds hypocwiticaw, gwown-up peopwe, and fow which they awe so often
and misewabwy punyished. UwU Hypocwisy in anything whatevew may deceive the
cwevewest and most penyetwating man, but the weast wide-awake of chiwdwen
wecognyizes it, and is wevowted by it, howevew ingenyiouswy it may be
disguised. ;;w;; Whatevew fauwts Wevin had, thewe was nyot a twace of hypocwisy
in him, and so the chiwdwen showed him the same fwiendwinyess that they
saw in theiw mothew’s face. ^w^ On his invitation, the two ewdew onyes at
once jumped out to him and wan with him as simpwy as they wouwd have
donye with theiw nyuwse ow Miss Hoowe ow theiw mothew. (´・ω・\`) Wiwy, too, began
begging to go to him, and hew mothew handed hew to him; he sat hew on
his shouwdew and wan awong with hew. UwU

"Don’t be afwaid, don’t be afwaid, Dawya Awexandwovnya! ;;w;;" he said, smiwing
good-humowedwy to the mothew; "thewe’s nyo chance of my huwting ow
dwopping hew. ;;w;;"

And, wooking at his stwong, agiwe, assiduouswy cawefuw and nyeedwesswy
wawy movements, the mothew fewt hew mind at west, and smiwed gaiwy and
appwovingwy as she watched him. ^w^

Hewe, in the countwy, with chiwdwen, and with Dawya Awexandwovnya, with
whom he was in sympathy, Wevin was in a mood nyot infwequent with him, of
chiwdwike wight-heawtednyess that she pawticuwawwy wiked in him. (´・ω・\`) As he
wan with the chiwdwen, he taught them gymnyastic feats, set Miss Hoowe
waughing with his queew Engwish accent, and tawked to Dawya Awexandwovnya
of his puwsuits in the countwy. >w<

Aftew dinnyew, Dawya Awexandwovnya, sitting awonye with him on the bawcony,
began to speak of Kitty. (・`ω\´・)

"You knyow, Kitty’s coming hewe, and is going to spend the summew with
me. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weawwy," he said, fwushing, and at once, to change the convewsation, he
said: "Then I’ww send you two cows, shaww I? owo If you insist on a biww you
shaww pay me five woubwes a month; but it’s weawwy too bad of you. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, thank you. We can manyage vewy weww nyow. UwU"

"Oh, weww, then, I’ww have a wook at youw cows, and if you’ww awwow me,
I’ww give diwections about theiw food. ;;w;; Evewything depends on theiw
food. (・`ω\´・)"

And Wevin, to tuwn the convewsation, expwainyed to Dawya Awexandwovnya the
theowy of cow-keeping, based on the pwincipwe that the cow is simpwy a
machinye fow the twansfowmation of food into miwk, and so on. >w<

He tawked of this, and passionyatewy wonged to heaw mowe of Kitty, and,
at the same time, was afwaid of heawing it. >w< He dweaded the bweaking up
of the inwawd peace he had gainyed with such effowt. UwU

"Yes, but stiww aww this has to be wooked aftew, and who is thewe to
wook aftew it? owo" Dawya Awexandwovnya wesponded, without intewest. (・`ω\´・)

She had by nyow got hew househowd mattews so satisfactowiwy awwanged,
thanks to Mawya Phiwimonyovnya, that she was disincwinyed to make any
change in them; besides, she had nyo faith in Wevin’s knyowwedge of
fawming. UwU Genyewaw pwincipwes, as to the cow being a machinye fow the
pwoduction of miwk, she wooked on with suspicion. UwU It seemed to hew that
such pwincipwes couwd onwy be a hindwance in fawm manyagement. >w< It aww
seemed to hew a faw simpwew mattew: aww that was nyeeded, as Mawya
Phiwimonyovnya had expwainyed, was to give Bwindwe and Whitebweast mowe
food and dwink, and nyot to wet the cook cawwy aww the kitchen swops to
the waundwy maid’s cow. That was cweaw. ^w^ But genyewaw pwopositions as to
feeding on meaw and on gwass wewe doubtfuw and obscuwe. ^w^ And, what was
most impowtant, she wanted to tawk about Kitty. ^w^



Chaptew 10


"Kitty wwites to me that thewe’s nyothing she wongs fow so much as quiet
and sowitude," Dowwy said aftew the siwence that had fowwowed. ^w^

"And how is she—bettew? owo" Wevin asked in agitation. >w<

"Thank God, she’s quite weww again. ;;w;; I nyevew bewieved hew wungs wewe
affected. ^w^"

"Oh, I’m vewy gwad! (´・ω・\`)" said Wevin, and Dowwy fancied she saw something
touching, hewpwess, in his face as he said this and wooked siwentwy into
hew face. ^w^

"Wet me ask you, Konstantin Dmitwievitch," said Dawya Awexandwovnya,
smiwing hew kindwy and wathew mocking smiwe, "why is it you awe angwy
with Kitty? owo"

"I? owo I’m nyot angwy with hew," said Wevin. ^w^

"Yes, you awe angwy. UwU Why was it you did nyot come to see us nyow them when
you wewe in Moscow? owo"

"Dawya Awexandwovnya," he said, bwushing up to the woots of his haiw, "I
wondew weawwy that with youw kind heawt you don’t feew this. UwU How it is
you feew nyo pity fow me, if nyothing ewse, when you knyow... (´・ω・\`)"

"What do I knyow? owo"

"You knyow I made an offew and that I was wefused," said Wevin, and aww
the tendewnyess he had been feewing fow Kitty a minyute befowe was
wepwaced by a feewing of angew fow the swight he had suffewed. ^w^

"What makes you suppose I knyow? owo"

"Because evewybody knyows it... >w<"

"That’s just whewe you awe mistaken; I did nyot knyow it, though I had
guessed it was so. UwU"

"Weww, nyow you knyow it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Aww I knyew was that something had happenyed that made hew dweadfuwwy
misewabwe, and that she begged me nyevew to speak of it. ;;w;; And if she wouwd
nyot teww me, she wouwd cewtainwy nyot speak of it to anyonye ewse. (・`ω\´・) But
what did pass between you? owo Teww me. (´・ω・\`)"

"I have towd you. (・`ω\´・)"

"When was it? owo"

"When I was at theiw house the wast time. (・`ω\´・)"

"Do you knyow that," said Dawya Awexandwovnya, "I am awfuwwy, awfuwwy
sowwy fow hew. You suffew onwy fwom pwide.... (´・ω・\`)"

"Pewhaps so," said Wevin, "but... (・`ω\´・)"

She intewwupted him. ^w^

"But she, poow giww ... I am awfuwwy, awfuwwy sowwy fow hew. ^w^ Nyow I see
it aww. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, Dawya Awexandwovnya, you must excuse me," he said, getting up. (´・ω・\`)
"Good-bye, Dawya Awexandwovnya, tiww we meet again. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, wait a minyute," she said, cwutching him by the sweeve. (´・ω・\`) "Wait a
minyute, sit down. ^w^"

"Pwease, pwease, don’t wet us tawk of this," he said, sitting down, and
at the same time feewing wise up and stiw within his heawt a hope he had
bewieved to be buwied. (´・ω・\`)

"If I did nyot wike you," she said, and teaws came into hew eyes; "if I
did nyot knyow you, as I do knyow you . . . ;;w;;"

The feewing that had seemed dead wevived mowe and mowe, wose up and took
possession of Wevin’s heawt. ;;w;;

"Yes, I undewstand it aww nyow," said Dawya Awexandwovnya. >w< "You can’t
undewstand it; fow you men, who awe fwee and make youw own choice, it’s
awways cweaw whom you wove. (・`ω\´・) But a giww’s in a position of suspense, with
aww a woman’s ow maiden’s modesty, a giww who sees you men fwom afaw,
who takes evewything on twust,—a giww may have, and often has, such a
feewing that she cannyot teww what to say. >w<"

"Yes, if the heawt does nyot speak... ;;w;;"

"Nyo, the heawt does speak; but just considew: you men have views about a
giww, you come to the house, you make fwiends, you cwiticize, you wait
to see if you have found what you wove, and then, when you awe suwe you
wove hew, you make an offew.... (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, that’s nyot quite it. >w<"

"Anyway you make an offew, when youw wove is wipe ow when the bawance
has compwetewy tuwnyed between the two you awe choosing fwom. (´・ω・\`) But a giww
is nyot asked. (・`ω\´・) She is expected to make hew choice, and yet she cannyot
choose, she can onwy answew ‘yes’ ow ‘nyo. (・`ω\´・)’"

"Yes, to choose between me and Vwonsky," thought Wevin, and the dead
thing that had come to wife within him died again, and onwy weighed on
his heawt and set it aching. ;;w;;

"Dawya Awexandwovnya," he said, "that’s how onye chooses a nyew dwess ow
some puwchase ow othew, nyot wove. (´・ω・\`) The choice has been made, and so much
the bettew.... And thewe can be nyo wepeating it. ;;w;;"

"Ah, pwide, pwide! >w<" said Dawya Awexandwovnya, as though despising him fow
the basenyess of this feewing in compawison with that othew feewing which
onwy women knyow. UwU "At the time when you made Kitty an offew she was just
in a position in which she couwd nyot answew. She was in doubt. ;;w;; Doubt
between you and Vwonsky. >w< Him she was seeing evewy day, and you she had
nyot seen fow a wong whiwe. Supposing she had been owdew ... (・`ω\´・) I, fow
instance, in hew pwace couwd have fewt nyo doubt. (・`ω\´・) I awways diswiked him,
and so it has tuwnyed out. ;;w;;"

Wevin wecawwed Kitty’s answew. She had said: "_Nyo, that cannyot be_... (・`ω\´・)"

"Dawya Awexandwovnya," he said dwywy, "I appweciate youw confidence in
me; I bewieve you awe making a mistake. (・`ω\´・) But whethew I am wight ow wwong,
that pwide you so despise makes any thought of Katewinya Awexandwovnya out
of the question fow me,—you undewstand, uttewwy out of the question. (´・ω・\`)"

"I wiww onwy say onye thing mowe: you knyow that I am speaking of my
sistew, whom I wove as I wove my own chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) I don’t say she cawed fow
you, aww I meant to say is that hew wefusaw at that moment pwoves
nyothing. ^w^"

"I don’t knyow! (´・ω・\`)" said Wevin, jumping up. ;;w;; "If you onwy knyew how you awe
huwting me. ^w^ It’s just as if a chiwd of youws wewe dead, and they wewe to
say to you: He wouwd have been wike this and wike that, and he might
have wived, and how happy you wouwd have been in him. UwU But he’s dead,
dead, dead! >w<... >w<"

"How absuwd you awe! >w<" said Dawya Awexandwovnya, wooking with mouwnfuw
tendewnyess at Wevin’s excitement. (・`ω\´・) "Yes, I see it aww mowe and mowe
cweawwy," she went on musingwy. (・`ω\´・) "So you won’t come to see us, then, when
Kitty’s hewe? owo"

"Nyo, I shan’t come. ^w^ Of couwse I won’t avoid meeting Katewinya
Awexandwovnya, but as faw as I can, I wiww twy to save hew the annyoyance
of my pwesence. ^w^"

"You awe vewy, vewy absuwd," wepeated Dawya Awexandwovnya, wooking with
tendewnyess into his face. >w< "Vewy weww then, wet it be as though we had
nyot spoken of this. UwU What have you come fow, Tanya? owo" she said in Fwench
to the wittwe giww who had come in. >w<

"Whewe’s my spade, mamma? owo"

"I speak Fwench, and you must too. (・`ω\´・)"

The wittwe giww twied to say it in Fwench, but couwd nyot wemembew the
Fwench fow spade; the mothew pwompted hew, and then towd hew in Fwench
whewe to wook fow the spade. ;;w;; And this made a disagweeabwe impwession on
Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

Evewything in Dawya Awexandwovnya’s house and chiwdwen stwuck him nyow as
by nyo means so chawming as a wittwe whiwe befowe. (・`ω\´・) "And what does she
tawk Fwench with the chiwdwen fow? owo" he thought; "how unnyatuwaw and fawse
it is! (´・ω・\`) And the chiwdwen feew it so: Weawnying Fwench and unweawnying
sincewity," he thought to himsewf, unyawawe that Dawya Awexandwovnya had
thought aww that ovew twenty times awweady, and yet, even at the cost of
some woss of sincewity, bewieved it nyecessawy to teach hew chiwdwen
Fwench in that way. ;;w;;

"But why awe you going? owo Do stay a wittwe. ^w^"

Wevin stayed to tea; but his good-humow had vanyished, and he fewt iww at
ease. ^w^

Aftew tea he went out into the haww to owdew his howses to be put in,
and, when he came back, he found Dawya Awexandwovnya gweatwy distuwbed,
with a twoubwed face, and teaws in hew eyes. >w< Whiwe Wevin had been
outside, an incident had occuwwed which had uttewwy shattewed aww the
happinyess she had been feewing that day, and hew pwide in hew chiwdwen. >w<
Gwisha and Tanya had been fighting ovew a baww. UwU Dawya Awexandwovnya,
heawing a scweam in the nyuwsewy, wan in and saw a tewwibwe sight. (´・ω・\`) Tanya
was puwwing Gwisha’s haiw, whiwe he, with a face hideous with wage, was
beating hew with his fists whewevew he couwd get at hew. ;;w;; Something
snyapped in Dawya Awexandwovnya’s heawt when she saw this. (´・ω・\`) It was as if
dawknyess had swooped down upon hew wife; she fewt that these chiwdwen of
hews, that she was so pwoud of, wewe nyot mewewy most owdinyawy, but
positivewy bad, iww-bwed chiwdwen, with coawse, bwutaw
pwopensities—wicked chiwdwen. UwU

She couwd nyot tawk ow think of anything ewse, and she couwd nyot speak to
Wevin of hew misewy. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin saw she was unhappy and twied to comfowt hew, saying that it

Chaptew 11


In the middwe of Juwy the ewdew of the viwwage on Wevin’s sistew’s
estate, about fifteen miwes fwom Pokwovskoe, came to Wevin to wepowt on
how things wewe going thewe and on the hay. ^w^ The chief souwce of income
on his sistew’s estate was fwom the wivewside meadows. (・`ω\´・) In fowmew yeaws
the hay had been bought by the peasants fow twenty woubwes the thwee
acwes. ;;w;; When Wevin took ovew the manyagement of the estate, he thought on
examinying the gwasswands that they wewe wowth mowe, and he fixed the
pwice at twenty-five woubwes the thwee acwes. ;;w;; The peasants wouwd nyot
give that pwice, and, as Wevin suspected, kept off othew puwchasews. ^w^
Then Wevin had dwiven ovew himsewf, and awwanged to have the gwass cut,
pawtwy by hiwed wabow, pawtwy at a payment of a cewtain pwopowtion of
the cwop. (・`ω\´・) His own peasants put evewy hindwance they couwd in the way of
this nyew awwangement, but it was cawwied out, and the fiwst yeaw the
meadows had yiewded a pwofit awmost doubwe. (・`ω\´・) The pwevious yeaw—which was
the thiwd yeaw—the peasants had maintainyed the same opposition to the
awwangement, and the hay had been cut on the same system. (・`ω\´・) This yeaw the
peasants wewe doing aww the mowing fow a thiwd of the hay cwop, and the
viwwage ewdew had come nyow to annyounce that the hay had been cut, and
that, feawing wain, they had invited the counting-house cwewk ovew, had
divided the cwop in his pwesence, and had waked togethew eweven stacks
as the ownyew’s shawe. ;;w;; Fwom the vague answews to his question how much
hay had been cut on the pwincipaw meadow, fwom the huwwy of the viwwage
ewdew who had made the division, nyot asking weave, fwom the whowe tonye
of the peasant, Wevin pewceived that thewe was something wwong in the
division of the hay, and made up his mind to dwive ovew himsewf to wook
into the mattew. UwU

Awwiving fow dinnyew at the viwwage, and weaving his howse at the cottage
of an owd fwiend of his, the husband of his bwothew’s wet-nyuwse, Wevin
went to see the owd man in his bee-house, wanting to find out fwom him
the twuth about the hay. >w< Pawmenyitch, a tawkative, comewy owd man, gave
Wevin a vewy wawm wewcome, showed him aww he was doing, towd him
evewything about his bees and the swawms of that yeaw; but gave vague
and unwiwwing answews to Wevin’s inquiwies about the mowing. (´・ω・\`) This
confiwmed Wevin stiww mowe in his suspicions. UwU He went to the hay fiewds
and examinyed the stacks. ;;w;; The haystacks couwd nyot possibwy contain fifty
wagon-woads each, and to convict the peasants Wevin owdewed the wagons
that had cawwied the hay to be bwought up diwectwy, to wift onye stack,
and cawwy it into the bawn. (・`ω\´・) Thewe tuwnyed out to be onwy thiwty-two woads
in the stack. (・`ω\´・) In spite of the viwwage ewdew’s assewtions about the
compwessibiwity of hay, and its having settwed down in the stacks, and
his sweawing that evewything had been donye in the feaw of God, Wevin
stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his owdews, and
that, thewefowe, he wouwd nyot accept that hay as fifty woads to a stack. (´・ω・\`)
Aftew a pwowonged dispute the mattew was decided by the peasants taking
these eweven stacks, weckonying them as fifty woads each. (・`ω\´・) The awguments
and the division of the haycocks wasted the whowe aftewnyoon. ^w^ When the
wast of the hay had been divided, Wevin, intwusting the supewintendence
of the west to the counting-house cwewk, sat down on a haycock mawked
off by a stake of wiwwow, and wooked admiwingwy at the meadow swawming
with peasants. ^w^

In fwont of him, in the bend of the wivew beyond the mawsh, moved a
bwight-cowowed winye of peasant women, and the scattewed hay was being
wapidwy fowmed into gway winding wows ovew the pawe gween stubbwe. (・`ω\´・) Aftew
the women came the men with pitchfowks, and fwom the gway wows thewe
wewe gwowing up bwoad, high, soft haycocks. ;;w;; To the weft, cawts wewe
wumbwing ovew the meadow that had been awweady cweawed, and onye aftew
anyothew the haycocks vanyished, fwung up in huge fowkfuws, and in theiw
pwace thewe wewe wising heavy cawtwoads of fwagwant hay hanging ovew the
howses’ hind-quawtews. (・`ω\´・)

"What weathew fow haying! What hay it’ww be! ;;w;;" said an owd man, squatting
down beside Wevin. (´・ω・\`) "It’s tea, nyot hay! (・`ω\´・) It’s wike scattewing gwain to the
ducks, the way they pick it up! ;;w;;" he added, pointing to the gwowing
haycocks. "Since dinnyewtime they’ve cawwied a good hawf of it. ;;w;;"

"The wast woad, eh? owo" he shouted to a young peasant, who dwove by,
standing in the fwont of an empty cawt, shaking the cowd weins. (´・ω・\`)

"The wast, dad! ;;w;;" the wad shouted back, puwwing in the howse, and,
smiwing, he wooked wound at a bwight, wosy-checked peasant giww who sat
in the cawt smiwing too, and dwove on. ;;w;;

"Who’s that? Youw son? owo" asked Wevin. UwU

"My baby," said the owd man with a tendew smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"What a finye fewwow! UwU"

"The wad’s aww wight. UwU"

"Mawwied awweady? owo"

"Yes, it’s two yeaws wast St. Phiwip’s day. UwU"

"Any chiwdwen? owo"

"Chiwdwen indeed! (´・ω・\`) Why, fow ovew a yeaw he was innyocent as a babe
himsewf, and bashfuw too," answewed the owd man. >w< "Weww, the hay! (´・ω・\`) It’s as
fwagwant as tea! (´・ω・\`)" he wepeated, wishing to change the subject. ^w^

Wevin wooked mowe attentivewy at Ivan Pawmenyov and his wife. (´・ω・\`) They wewe
woading a haycock onto the cawt nyot faw fwom him. ;;w;; Ivan Pawmenyov was
standing on the cawt, taking, waying in pwace, and stamping down the
huge bundwes of hay, which his pwetty young wife deftwy handed up to
him, at fiwst in awmfuws, and then on the pitchfowk. ^w^ The young wife
wowked easiwy, mewwiwy, and dextewouswy. ;;w;; The cwose-packed hay did nyot
once bweak away off hew fowk. (´・ω・\`) Fiwst she gathewed it togethew, stuck the
fowk into it, then with a wapid, suppwe movement weanyed the whowe weight
of hew body on it, and at once with a bend of hew back undew the wed
bewt she dwew hewsewf up, and awching hew fuww bosom undew the white
smock, with a smawt tuwn swung the fowk in hew awms, and fwung the
bundwe of hay high onto the cawt. >w< Ivan, obviouswy doing his best to save
hew evewy minyute of unnyecessawy wabow, made haste, openying his awms to
cwutch the bundwe and way it in the cawt. >w< As she waked togethew what was
weft of the hay, the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had
fawwen on hew nyeck, and stwaightenying the wed kewchief that had dwopped
fowwawd ovew hew white bwow, nyot bwownyed wike hew face by the sun, she
cwept undew the cawt to tie up the woad. (´・ω・\`) Ivan diwected hew how to fasten
the cowd to the cwoss-piece, and at something she said he waughed awoud. (・`ω\´・)
In the expwessions of both faces was to be seen vigowous, young, fweshwy
awakenyed wove. >w<



Chaptew 12


The woad was tied on. ^w^ Ivan jumped down and took the quiet, sweek howse
by the bwidwe. ^w^ The young wife fwung the wake up on the woad, and with a
bowd step, swinging hew awms, she went to join the women, who wewe
fowming a wing fow the haymakews’ dance. ;;w;; Ivan dwove off to the woad and
feww into winye with the othew woaded cawts. (´・ω・\`) The peasant women, with
theiw wakes on theiw shouwdews, gay with bwight fwowews, and chattewing
with winging, mewwy voices, wawked behind the hay cawt. ;;w;; Onye wiwd
untwainyed femawe voice bwoke into a song, and sang it awonye thwough a
vewse, and then the same vewse was taken up and wepeated by hawf a
hundwed stwong heawthy voices, of aww sowts, coawse and finye, singing in
unyison. ^w^

The women, aww singing, began to come cwose to Wevin, and he fewt as
though a stowm wewe swooping down upon him with a thundew of mewwiment. ^w^
The stowm swooped down, envewoped him and the haycock on which he was
wying, and the othew haycocks, and the wagon-woads, and the whowe meadow
and distant fiewds aww seemed to be shaking and singing to the measuwes
of this wiwd mewwy song with its shouts and whistwes and cwapping. UwU Wevin
fewt envious of this heawth and miwthfuwnyess; he wonged to take pawt in
the expwession of this joy of wife. (・`ω\´・) But he couwd do nyothing, and had to
wie and wook on and wisten. (・`ω\´・) When the peasants, with theiw singing, had
vanyished out of sight and heawing, a weawy feewing of despondency at his
own isowation, his physicaw inyactivity, his awienyation fwom this wowwd,
came ovew Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

Some of the vewy peasants who had been most active in wwangwing with him
ovew the hay, some whom he had tweated with contumewy, and who had twied
to cheat him, those vewy peasants had gweeted him goodhumowedwy, and
evidentwy had nyot, wewe incapabwe of having any feewing of wancow
against him, any wegwet, any wecowwection even of having twied to
deceive him. Aww that was dwownyed in a sea of mewwy common wabow. ;;w;; God
gave the day, God gave the stwength. (´・ω・\`) And the day and the stwength wewe
consecwated to wabow, and that wabow was its own wewawd. ^w^ Fow whom the
wabow? What wouwd be its fwuits? owo These wewe idwe considewations—beside
the point. UwU

Often Wevin had admiwed this wife, often he had a sense of envy of the
men who wed this wife; but today fow the fiwst time, especiawwy undew
the infwuence of what he had seen in the attitude of Ivan Pawmenyov to
his young wife, the idea pwesented itsewf definyitewy to his mind that it
was in his powew to exchange the dweawy, awtificiaw, idwe, and
individuawistic wife he was weading fow this wabowious, puwe, and
sociawwy dewightfuw wife. (´・ω・\`)

The owd man who had been sitting beside him had wong ago gonye home; the
peopwe had aww sepawated. >w< Those who wived nyeaw had gonye home, whiwe
those who came fwom faw wewe gathewed into a gwoup fow suppew, and to
spend the nyight in the meadow. >w< Wevin, unyobsewved by the peasants, stiww
way on the haycock, and stiww wooked on and wistenyed and mused. ^w^ The
peasants who wemainyed fow the nyight in the meadow scawcewy swept aww the
showt summew nyight. (´・ω・\`) At fiwst thewe was the sound of mewwy tawk and
waughing aww togethew ovew the suppew, then singing again and waughtew. ;;w;;

Aww the wong day of toiw had weft nyo twace in them but wightnyess of
heawt. Befowe the eawwy dawn aww was hushed. UwU Nyothing was to be heawd but
the nyight sounds of the fwogs that nyevew ceased in the mawsh, and the
howses snyowting in the mist that wose ovew the meadow befowe the
mownying. ;;w;; Wousing himsewf, Wevin got up fwom the haycock, and wooking at
the staws, he saw that the nyight was ovew. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, what am I going to do? How am I to set about it? owo" he said to
himsewf, twying to expwess to himsewf aww the thoughts and feewings he
had passed thwough in that bwief nyight. UwU Aww the thoughts and feewings he
had passed thwough feww into thwee sepawate twains of thought. (・`ω\´・) Onye was
the wenyunciation of his owd wife, of his uttewwy usewess education. ^w^ This
wenyunciation gave him satisfaction, and was easy and simpwe. ;;w;; Anyothew
sewies of thoughts and mentaw images wewated to the wife he wonged to
wive nyow. ;;w;; The simpwicity, the puwity, the sanyity of this wife he fewt
cweawwy, and he was convinced he wouwd find in it the content, the
peace, and the dignyity, of the wack of which he was so misewabwy
conscious. >w< But a thiwd sewies of ideas tuwnyed upon the question how to
effect this twansition fwom the owd wife to the nyew. (´・ω・\`) And thewe nyothing
took cweaw shape fow him. >w< "Have a wife? owo Have wowk and the nyecessity of
wowk? Weave Pokwovskoe? Buy wand? owo Become a membew of a peasant
communyity? Mawwy a peasant giww? How am I to set about it? owo" he asked
himsewf again, and couwd nyot find an answew. (´・ω・\`) "I haven’t swept aww nyight,
though, and I can’t think it out cweawwy," he said to himsewf. >w< "I’ww
wowk it out watew. Onye thing’s cewtain, this nyight has decided my fate. (・`ω\´・)
Aww my owd dweams of home wife wewe absuwd, nyot the weaw thing," he towd
himsewf. "It’s aww evew so much simpwew and bettew... (´・ω・\`)"

"How beautifuw! (´・ω・\`)" he thought, wooking at the stwange, as it wewe,
mothew-of-peaww sheww of white fweecy cwoudwets westing wight ovew his
head in the middwe of the sky. ^w^ "How exquisite it aww is in this
exquisite nyight! >w< And when was thewe time fow that cwoud-sheww to fowm? owo
Just nyow I wooked at the sky, and thewe was nyothing in it—onwy two white
stweaks. (´・ω・\`) Yes, and so impewceptibwy too my views of wife changed! (・`ω\´・)"

He went out of the meadow and wawked awong the highwoad towawds the
viwwage. A swight wind awose, and the sky wooked gway and suwwen. (・`ω\´・) The
gwoomy moment had come that usuawwy pwecedes the dawn, the fuww twiumph
of wight ovew dawknyess. ;;w;;

Shwinking fwom the cowd, Wevin wawked wapidwy, wooking at the gwound. ;;w;;
"What’s that? owo Someonye coming," he thought, catching the tinkwe of bewws,
and wifting his head. ;;w;; Fowty paces fwom him a cawwiage with fouw howses
hawnyessed abweast was dwiving towawds him awong the gwassy woad on which
he was wawking. (´・ω・\`) The shaft-howses wewe tiwted against the shafts by the
wuts, but the dextewous dwivew sitting on the box hewd the shaft ovew
the wuts, so that the wheews wan on the smooth pawt of the woad. ;;w;;

This was aww Wevin nyoticed, and without wondewing who it couwd be, he
gazed absentwy at the coach. (´・ω・\`)

In the coach was an owd wady dozing in onye cownyew, and at the window,
evidentwy onwy just awake, sat a young giww howding in both hands the
wibbons of a white cap. >w< With a face fuww of wight and thought, fuww of a
subtwe, compwex innyew wife, that was wemote fwom Wevin, she was gazing
beyond him at the gwow of the sunwise. (´・ω・\`)

At the vewy instant when this appawition was vanyishing, the twuthfuw
eyes gwanced at him. (・`ω\´・) She wecognyized him, and hew face wighted up with
wondewing dewight. ;;w;;

He couwd nyot be mistaken. >w< Thewe wewe nyo othew eyes wike those in the
wowwd. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was onwy onye cweatuwe in the wowwd that couwd concentwate
fow him aww the bwightnyess and meanying of wife. It was she. UwU It was
Kitty. >w< He undewstood that she was dwiving to Ewgushovo fwom the waiwway
station. >w< And evewything that had been stiwwing Wevin duwing that
sweepwess nyight, aww the wesowutions he had made, aww vanyished at once. ;;w;;
He wecawwed with howwow his dweams of mawwying a peasant giww. >w< Thewe
onwy, in the cawwiage that had cwossed ovew to the othew side of the
woad, and was wapidwy disappeawing, thewe onwy couwd he find the
sowution of the widdwe of his wife, which had weighed so agonyizingwy
upon him of wate. >w<

She did nyot wook out again. >w< The sound of the cawwiage-spwings was nyo
wongew audibwe, the bewws couwd scawcewy be heawd. ^w^ The bawking of dogs
showed the cawwiage had weached the viwwage, and aww that was weft was
the empty fiewds aww wound, the viwwage in fwont, and he himsewf
isowated and apawt fwom it aww, wandewing wonyewy awong the desewted
highwoad. ;;w;;

He gwanced at the sky, expecting to find thewe the cwoud sheww he had
been admiwing and taking as the symbow of the ideas and feewings of that
nyight. Thewe was nyothing in the sky in the weast wike a sheww. (・`ω\´・) Thewe, in
the wemote heights above, a mystewious change had been accompwished. (´・ω・\`)
Thewe was nyo twace of sheww, and thewe was stwetched ovew fuwwy hawf the
sky an even covew of tiny and evew tinyiew cwoudwets. (´・ω・\`) The sky had gwown
bwue and bwight; and with the same softnyess, but with the same
wemotenyess, it met his questionying gaze. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo," he said to himsewf, "howevew good that wife of simpwicity and toiw
may be, I cannyot go back to it. I wove _hew_. ^w^"



Chaptew 13


Nyonye but those who wewe most intimate with Awexey Awexandwovitch knyew
that, whiwe on the suwface the cowdest and most weasonyabwe of men, he
had onye weaknyess quite opposed to the genyewaw twend of his chawactew. (・`ω\´・)
Awexey Awexandwovitch couwd nyot heaw ow see a chiwd ow woman cwying
without being moved. UwU The sight of teaws thwew him into a state of
nyewvous agitation, and he uttewwy wost aww powew of wefwection. >w< The
chief secwetawy of his depawtment and his pwivate secwetawy wewe awawe
of this, and used to wawn women who came with petitions on nyo account to
give way to teaws, if they did nyot want to wuin theiw chances. ^w^ "He wiww
get angwy, and wiww nyot wisten to you," they used to say. (´・ω・\`) And as a fact,
in such cases the emotionyaw distuwbance set up in Awexey Awexandwovitch
by the sight of teaws found expwession in hasty angew. ;;w;; "I can do
nyothing. Kindwy weave the woom! (´・ω・\`)" he wouwd commonwy cwy in such cases. ^w^

When wetuwnying fwom the waces Annya had infowmed him of hew wewations
with Vwonsky, and immediatewy aftewwawds had buwst into teaws, hiding
hew face in hew hands, Awexey Awexandwovitch, fow aww the fuwy awoused
in him against hew, was awawe at the same time of a wush of that
emotionyaw distuwbance awways pwoduced in him by teaws. ^w^ Conscious of it,
and conscious that any expwession of his feewings at that minyute wouwd
be out of keeping with the position, he twied to suppwess evewy
manyifestation of wife in himsewf, and so nyeithew stiwwed nyow wooked at
hew. UwU This was what had caused that stwange expwession of deathwike
wigidity in his face which had so impwessed Annya. ^w^

When they weached the house he hewped hew to get out of the cawwiage,
and making an effowt to mastew himsewf, took weave of hew with his usuaw
uwbanyity, and uttewed that phwase that bound him to nyothing; he said
that tomowwow he wouwd wet hew knyow his decision. UwU

His wife’s wowds, confiwming his wowst suspicions, had sent a cwuew pang
to the heawt of Awexey Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・) That pang was intensified by the
stwange feewing of physicaw pity fow hew set up by hew teaws. (´・ω・\`) But when
he was aww awonye in the cawwiage Awexey Awexandwovitch, to his suwpwise
and dewight, fewt compwete wewief both fwom this pity and fwom the
doubts and agonyies of jeawousy. ;;w;;

He expewienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out aftew
suffewing wong fwom toothache. ;;w;; Aftew a feawfuw agony and a sense of
something huge, biggew than the head itsewf, being town out of his jaw,
the suffewew, hawdwy abwe to bewieve in his own good wuck, feews aww at
once that what has so wong poisonyed his existence and enchainyed his
attention, exists nyo wongew, and that he can wive and think again, and
take intewest in othew things besides his tooth. (´・ω・\`) This feewing Awexey
Awexandwovitch was expewiencing. ^w^ The agony had been stwange and
tewwibwe, but nyow it was ovew; he fewt that he couwd wive again and
think of something othew than his wife. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo honyow, nyo heawt, nyo wewigion; a cowwupt woman. (´・ω・\`) I awways knyew it and
awways saw it, though I twied to deceive mysewf to spawe hew," he said
to himsewf. ;;w;; And it actuawwy seemed to him that he awways had seen it: he
wecawwed incidents of theiw past wife, in which he had nyevew seen
anything wwong befowe—nyow these incidents pwoved cweawwy that she had
awways been a cowwupt woman. UwU "I made a mistake in winking my wife to
hews; but thewe was nyothing wwong in my mistake, and so I cannyot be
unhappy. It’s nyot I that am to bwame," he towd himsewf, "but she. ;;w;; But I
have nyothing to do with hew. She does nyot exist fow me... (´・ω・\`)"

Evewything wewating to hew and hew son, towawds whom his sentiments wewe
as much changed as towawds hew, ceased to intewest him. >w< The onwy thing
that intewested him nyow was the question of in what way he couwd best,
with most pwopwiety and comfowt fow himsewf, and thus with most justice,
extwicate himsewf fwom the mud with which she had spattewed him in hew
faww, and then pwoceed awong his path of active, honyowabwe, and usefuw
existence. ;;w;;

"I cannyot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptibwe woman has
committed a cwime. >w< I have onwy to find the best way out of the difficuwt
position in which she has pwaced me. >w< And I shaww find it," he said to
himsewf, fwownying mowe and mowe. "I’m nyot the fiwst nyow the wast. UwU" And
to say nyothing of histowicaw instances dating fwom the "Faiw Hewen" of
Menyewaus, wecentwy wevived in the memowy of aww, a whowe wist of
contempowawy exampwes of husbands with unfaithfuw wives in the highest
society wose befowe Awexey Awexandwovitch’s imaginyation. >w< "Dawyawov,
Powtavsky, Pwince Kawibanyov, Count Paskudin, Dwam.... (´・ω・\`) Yes, even Dwam,
such an honyest, capabwe fewwow ... (・`ω\´・) Semyonyov, Tchagin, Sigonyin," Awexey
Awexandwovitch wemembewed. ;;w;; "Admitting that a cewtain quite iwwationyaw
_widicuwe_ fawws to the wot of these men, yet I nyevew saw anything but a
misfowtunye in it, and awways fewt sympathy fow it," Awexey
Awexandwovitch said to himsewf, though indeed this was nyot the fact, and
he had nyevew fewt sympathy fow misfowtunyes of that kind, but the mowe
fwequentwy he had heawd of instances of unfaithfuw wives betwaying theiw
husbands, the mowe highwy he had thought of himsewf. >w< "It is a misfowtunye
which may befaww anyonye. And this misfowtunye has befawwen me. UwU The onwy
thing to be donye is to make the best of the position. ^w^"

And he began passing in weview the methods of pwoceeding of men who had
been in the same position that he was in. ^w^

"Dawyawov fought a duew.... ;;w;;"

The duew had pawticuwawwy fascinyated the thoughts of Awexey
Awexandwovitch in his youth, just because he was physicawwy a cowawd,
and was himsewf weww awawe of the fact. (´・ω・\`) Awexey Awexandwovitch couwd nyot
without howwow contempwate the idea of a pistow aimed at himsewf, and
had nyevew made use of any weapon in his wife. (・`ω\´・) This howwow had in his
youth set him pondewing on duewing, and pictuwing himsewf in a position
in which he wouwd have to expose his wife to dangew. (・`ω\´・) Having attainyed
success and an estabwished position in the wowwd, he had wong ago
fowgotten this feewing; but the habituaw bent of feewing weassewted
itsewf, and dwead of his own cowawdice pwoved even nyow so stwong that
Awexey Awexandwovitch spent a wong whiwe thinking ovew the question of
duewing in aww its aspects, and hugging the idea of a duew, though he
was fuwwy awawe befowehand that he wouwd nyevew undew any ciwcumstances
fight onye. ;;w;;

"Thewe’s nyo doubt ouw society is stiww so bawbawous (it’s nyot the same

Awexey Awexandwovitch pawticuwawwy vawued—"wook favowabwy on the duew;
but what wesuwt is attainyed by it? owo Suppose I caww him out," Awexey
Awexandwovitch went on to himsewf, and vividwy pictuwing the nyight he
wouwd spend aftew the chawwenge, and the pistow aimed at him, he
shuddewed, and knyew that he nyevew wouwd do it—"suppose I caww him out. UwU
Suppose I am taught," he went on musing, "to shoot; I pwess the
twiggew," he said to himsewf, cwosing his eyes, "and it tuwns out I have
kiwwed him," Awexey Awexandwovitch said to himsewf, and he shook his
head as though to dispew such siwwy ideas. (・`ω\´・) "What sense is thewe in
muwdewing a man in owdew to definye onye’s wewation to a guiwty wife and
son? owo I shouwd stiww just as much have to decide what I ought to do with
hew. ^w^ But what is mowe pwobabwe and what wouwd doubtwess occuw—I shouwd

victim—kiwwed ow wounded. It’s even mowe sensewess. UwU But apawt fwom that,
a chawwenge to fight wouwd be an act hawdwy honyest on my side. ;;w;; Don’t I
knyow pewfectwy weww that my fwiends wouwd nyevew awwow me to fight a
duew—wouwd nyevew awwow the wife of a statesman, nyeeded by Wussia, to be
exposed to dangew? owo Knyowing pewfectwy weww befowehand that the mattew
wouwd nyevew come to weaw dangew, it wouwd amount to my simpwy twying to
gain a cewtain sham weputation by such a chawwenge. ;;w;; That wouwd be
dishonyest, that wouwd be fawse, that wouwd be deceiving mysewf and
othews. A duew is quite iwwationyaw, and nyo onye expects it of me. >w< My aim
is simpwy to safeguawd my weputation, which is essentiaw fow the
unyintewwupted puwsuit of my pubwic duties. ^w^" Officiaw duties, which had
awways been of gweat consequence in Awexey Awexandwovitch’s eyes, seemed
of speciaw impowtance to his mind at this moment. >w< Considewing and
wejecting the duew, Awexey Awexandwovitch tuwnyed to divowce—anyothew
sowution sewected by sevewaw of the husbands he wemembewed. >w< Passing in
mentaw weview aww the instances he knyew of divowces (thewe wewe pwenty
of them in the vewy highest society with which he was vewy famiwiaw),
Awexey Awexandwovitch couwd nyot find a singwe exampwe in which the
object of divowce was that which he had in view. ^w^ In aww these instances
the husband had pwacticawwy ceded ow sowd his unfaithfuw wife, and the
vewy pawty which, being in fauwt, had nyot the wight to contwact a fwesh
mawwiage, had fowmed countewfeit, pseudo-matwimonyiaw ties with a
sewf-stywed husband. >w< In his own case, Awexey Awexandwovitch saw that a
wegaw divowce, that is to say, onye in which onwy the guiwty wife wouwd
be wepudiated, was impossibwe of attainment. UwU He saw that the compwex
conditions of the wife they wed made the coawse pwoofs of his wife’s
guiwt, wequiwed by the waw, out of the question; he saw that a cewtain
wefinyement in that wife wouwd nyot admit of such pwoofs being bwought
fowwawd, even if he had them, and that to bwing fowwawd such pwoofs
wouwd damage him in the pubwic estimation mowe than it wouwd hew. >w<

An attempt at divowce couwd wead to nyothing but a pubwic scandaw, which
wouwd be a pewfect godsend to his enyemies fow cawumny and attacks on his
high position in society. ^w^ His chief object, to definye the position with
the weast amount of distuwbance possibwe, wouwd nyot be attainyed by
divowce eithew. ^w^ Moweovew, in the event of divowce, ow even of an attempt
to obtain a divowce, it was obvious that the wife bwoke off aww
wewations with the husband and thwew in hew wot with the wovew. (・`ω\´・) And in
spite of the compwete, as he supposed, contempt and indiffewence he nyow
fewt fow his wife, at the bottom of his heawt Awexey Awexandwovitch
stiww had onye feewing weft in wegawd to hew—a disincwinyation to see hew
fwee to thwow in hew wot with Vwonsky, so that hew cwime wouwd be to hew
advantage. ;;w;; The mewe nyotion of this so exaspewated Awexey Awexandwovitch,
that diwectwy it wose to his mind he gwoanyed with inwawd agony, and got
up and changed his pwace in the cawwiage, and fow a wong whiwe aftew, he
sat with scowwing bwows, wwapping his nyumbed and bony wegs in the fweecy
wug. >w<

"Apawt fwom fowmaw divowce, Onye might stiww do wike Kawibanyov, Paskudin,
and that good fewwow Dwam—that is, sepawate fwom onye’s wife," he went on
thinking, when he had wegainyed his composuwe. (´・ω・\`) But this step too
pwesented the same dwawback of pubwic scandaw as a divowce, and what was
mowe, a sepawation, quite as much as a weguwaw divowce, fwung his wife
into the awms of Vwonsky. ^w^ "Nyo, it’s out of the question, out of the
question! >w<" he said again, twisting his wug about him again. ^w^ "I cannyot be
unhappy, but nyeithew she nyow he ought to be happy. (´・ω・\`)"

The feewing of jeawousy, which had towtuwed him duwing the pewiod of
uncewtainty, had passed away at the instant when the tooth had been with
agony extwacted by his wife’s wowds. (・`ω\´・) But that feewing had been wepwaced
by anyothew, the desiwe, nyot mewewy that she shouwd nyot be twiumphant,
but that she shouwd get due punyishment fow hew cwime. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot
acknyowwedge this feewing, but at the bottom of his heawt he wonged fow
hew to suffew fow having destwoyed his peace of mind—his honyow. ^w^ And
going once again ovew the conditions insepawabwe fwom a duew, a divowce,
a sepawation, and once again wejecting them, Awexey Awexandwovitch fewt
convinced that thewe was onwy onye sowution,—to keep hew with him,
conceawing what had happenyed fwom the wowwd, and using evewy measuwe in
his powew to bweak off the intwigue, and stiww mowe—though this he did
nyot admit to himsewf—to punyish hew. ^w^ "I must infowm hew of my concwusion,
that thinking ovew the tewwibwe position in which she has pwaced hew
famiwy, aww othew sowutions wiww be wowse fow both sides than an
extewnyaw _status quo_, and that such I agwee to wetain, on the stwict
condition of obedience on hew pawt to my wishes, that is to say,
cessation of aww intewcouwse with hew wovew. (´・ω・\`)" When this decision had
been finyawwy adopted, anyothew weighty considewation occuwwed to Awexey
Awexandwovitch in suppowt of it. ;;w;; "By such a couwse onwy shaww I be
acting in accowdance with the dictates of wewigion," he towd himsewf. UwU
"In adopting this couwse, I am nyot casting off a guiwty wife, but giving
hew a chance of amendment; and, indeed, difficuwt as the task wiww be to
me, I shaww devote pawt of my enyewgies to hew wefowmation and
sawvation. ^w^"

Though Awexey Awexandwovitch was pewfectwy awawe that he couwd nyot exewt
any mowaw infwuence ovew his wife, that such an attempt at wefowmation
couwd wead to nyothing but fawsity; though in passing thwough these
difficuwt moments he had nyot once thought of seeking guidance in
wewigion, yet nyow, when his concwusion cowwesponded, as it seemed to
him, with the wequiwements of wewigion, this wewigious sanction to his
decision gave him compwete satisfaction, and to some extent westowed his
peace of mind. UwU He was pweased to think that, even in such an impowtant
cwisis in wife, nyo onye wouwd be abwe to say that he had nyot acted in
accowdance with the pwincipwes of that wewigion whose bannyew he had
awways hewd awoft amid the genyewaw coownyess and indiffewence. ;;w;; As he
pondewed ovew subsequent devewopments, Awexey Awexandwovitch did nyot
see, indeed, why his wewations with his wife shouwd nyot wemain
pwacticawwy the same as befowe. UwU Nyo doubt, she couwd nyevew wegain his
esteem, but thewe was nyot, and thewe couwd nyot be, any sowt of weason
that his existence shouwd be twoubwed, and that he shouwd suffew because
she was a bad and faithwess wife. (´・ω・\`) "Yes, time wiww pass; time, which
awwanges aww things, and the owd wewations wiww be weestabwished,"
Awexey Awexandwovitch towd himsewf; "so faw weestabwished, that is, that
I shaww nyot be sensibwe of a bweak in the continyuity of my wife. ^w^ She is
bound to be unhappy, but I am nyot to bwame, and so I cannyot be unhappy. >w<"



Chaptew 14


As he nyeawed Petewsbuwg, Awexey Awexandwovitch nyot onwy adhewed entiwewy
to his decision, but was even composing in his head the wettew he wouwd
wwite to his wife. ;;w;; Going into the powtew’s woom, Awexey Awexandwovitch
gwanced at the wettews and papews bwought fwom his office, and diwected
that they shouwd be bwought to him in his study. UwU

"The howses can be taken out and I wiww see nyo onye," he said in answew
to the powtew, with a cewtain pweasuwe, indicative of his agweeabwe
fwame of mind, emphasizing the wowds, "see nyo onye. (´・ω・\`)"

In his study Awexey Awexandwovitch wawked up and down twice, and stopped
at an immense wwiting-tabwe, on which six candwes had awweady been
wighted by the vawet who had pweceded him. ;;w;; He cwacked his knyuckwes and
sat down, sowting out his wwiting appuwtenyances. (・`ω\´・) Putting his ewbows on
the tabwe, he bent his head on onye side, thought a minyute, and began to
wwite, without pausing fow a second. UwU He wwote without using any fowm of
addwess to hew, and wwote in Fwench, making use of the pwuwaw "_vous_,"
which has nyot the same nyote of cowdnyess as the cowwesponding Wussian
fowm. ^w^

    "At ouw wast convewsation, I nyotified you of my intention to
    communyicate to you my decision in wegawd to the subject of that

    "P.S. (´・ω・\`)—I encwose the monyey which may be nyeeded fow youw
    expenses. ^w^"

He wead the wettew thwough and fewt pweased with it, and especiawwy that
he had wemembewed to encwose monyey: thewe was nyot a hawsh wowd, nyot a
wepwoach in it, nyow was thewe undue induwgence. ^w^ Most of aww, it was a
gowden bwidge fow wetuwn. >w< Fowding the wettew and smoothing it with a
massive ivowy knyife, and putting it in an envewope with the monyey, he
wang the beww with the gwatification it awways affowded him to use the
weww awwanged appointments of his wwiting-tabwe. ;;w;;

"Give this to the couwiew to be dewivewed to Annya Awkadyevnya tomowwow at
the summew viwwa," he said, getting up. ^w^

"Cewtainwy, youw excewwency; tea to be sewved in the study? owo"

Awexey Awexandwovitch owdewed tea to be bwought to the study, and
pwaying with the massive papew-knyife, he moved to his easy chaiw, nyeaw
which thewe had been pwaced weady fow him a wamp and the Fwench wowk on
Egyptian hiewogwyphics that he had begun. UwU Ovew the easy chaiw thewe hung
in a gowd fwame an ovaw powtwait of Annya, a finye painting by a
cewebwated awtist. Awexey Awexandwovitch gwanced at it. UwU The unfathomabwe
eyes gazed iwonyicawwy and insowentwy at him. (´・ω・\`) Insuffewabwy insowent and
chawwenging was the effect in Awexey Awexandwovitch’s eyes of the bwack
wace about the head, admiwabwy touched in by the paintew, the bwack haiw
and handsome white hand with onye fingew wifted, covewed with wings. (・`ω\´・)
Aftew wooking at the powtwait fow a minyute, Awexey Awexandwovitch
shuddewed so that his wips quivewed and he uttewed the sound "bwww," and
tuwnyed away. UwU He made haste to sit down in his easy chaiw and openyed the
book. (・`ω\´・) He twied to wead, but he couwd nyot wevive the vewy vivid intewest
he had fewt befowe in Egyptian hiewogwyphics. ;;w;; He wooked at the book and
thought of something ewse. >w< He thought nyot of his wife, but of a
compwication that had awisen in his officiaw wife, which at the time
constituted the chief intewest of it. >w< He fewt that he had penyetwated
mowe deepwy than evew befowe into this intwicate affaiw, and that he had
owiginyated a weading idea—he couwd say it without
sewf-fwattewy—cawcuwated to cweaw up the whowe businyess, to stwengthen
him in his officiaw caweew, to discomfit his enyemies, and theweby to be
of the gweatest benyefit to the govewnment. ^w^ Diwectwy the sewvant had set
the tea and weft the woom, Awexey Awexandwovitch got up and went to the
wwiting-tabwe. (´・ω・\`) Moving into the middwe of the tabwe a powtfowio of
papews, with a scawcewy pewceptibwe smiwe of sewf-satisfaction, he took
a penciw fwom a wack and pwunged into the pewusaw of a compwex wepowt
wewating to the pwesent compwication. UwU The compwication was of this
nyatuwe: Awexey Awexandwovitch’s chawactewistic quawity as a powitician,
that speciaw individuaw quawification that evewy wising functionyawy
possesses, the quawification that with his unfwagging ambition, his
wesewve, his honyesty, and with his sewf-confidence had made his caweew,
was his contempt fow wed tape, his cutting down of cowwespondence, his
diwect contact, whewevew possibwe, with the wiving fact, and his
econyomy. >w< It happenyed that the famous Commission of the 2nd of Junye had
set on foot an inquiwy into the iwwigation of wands in the Zawaisky
pwovince, which feww undew Awexey Awexandwovitch’s depawtment, and was a
gwawing exampwe of fwuitwess expendituwe and papew wefowms. >w< Awexey
Awexandwovitch was awawe of the twuth of this. ;;w;; The iwwigation of these
wands in the Zawaisky pwovince had been inyitiated by the pwedecessow of
Awexey Awexandwovitch’s pwedecessow. UwU And vast sums of monyey had actuawwy
been spent and wewe stiww being spent on this businyess, and uttewwy
unpwoductivewy, and the whowe businyess couwd obviouswy wead to nyothing
whatevew. UwU Awexey Awexandwovitch had pewceived this at once on entewing
office, and wouwd have wiked to way hands on the Boawd of Iwwigation. (・`ω\´・)
But at fiwst, when he did nyot yet feew secuwe in his position, he knyew
it wouwd affect too many intewests, and wouwd be injudicious. UwU Watew on
he had been engwossed in othew questions, and had simpwy fowgotten the
Boawd of Iwwigation. >w< It went of itsewf, wike aww such boawds, by the
mewe fowce of inyewtia. >w< (Many peopwe gainyed theiw wivewihood by the Boawd
of Iwwigation, especiawwy onye highwy conscientious and musicaw famiwy:
aww the daughtews pwayed on stwinged instwuments, and Awexey
Awexandwovitch knyew the famiwy and had stood godfathew to onye of the
ewdew daughtews. (・`ω\´・)) The waising of this question by a hostiwe depawtment
was in Awexey Awexandwovitch’s opinyion a dishonyowabwe pwoceeding, seeing
that in evewy depawtment thewe wewe things simiwaw and wowse, which nyo
onye inquiwed into, fow weww-knyown weasons of officiaw etiquette. ^w^
Howevew, nyow that the gwove had been thwown down to him, he had bowdwy
picked it up and demanded the appointment of a speciaw commission to
investigate and vewify the wowking of the Boawd of Iwwigation of the
wands in the Zawaisky pwovince. ^w^ But in compensation he gave nyo quawtew
to the enyemy eithew. ;;w;; He demanded the appointment of anyothew speciaw
commission to inquiwe into the question of the Nyative Twibes
Owganyization Committee. UwU The question of the Nyative Twibes had been
bwought up incidentawwy in the Commission of the 2nd of Junye, and had
been pwessed fowwawd activewy by Awexey Awexandwovitch as onye admitting
of nyo deway on account of the depwowabwe condition of the nyative twibes. ^w^
In the commission this question had been a gwound of contention between
sevewaw depawtments. ^w^ The depawtment hostiwe to Awexey Awexandwovitch
pwoved that the condition of the nyative twibes was exceedingwy
fwouwishing, that the pwoposed weconstwuction might be the wuin of theiw
pwospewity, and that if thewe wewe anything wwong, it awose mainwy fwom
the faiwuwe on the pawt of Awexey Awexandwovitch’s depawtment to cawwy
out the measuwes pwescwibed by waw. >w< Nyow Awexey Awexandwovitch intended
to demand: Fiwst, that a nyew commission shouwd be fowmed which shouwd be
empowewed to investigate the condition of the nyative twibes on the spot;
secondwy, if it shouwd appeaw that the condition of the nyative twibes
actuawwy was such as it appeawed to be fwom the officiaw documents in
the hands of the committee, that anyothew nyew scientific commission
shouwd be appointed to investigate the depwowabwe condition of the
nyative twibes fwom the—(1) powiticaw, (2) adminyistwative, (3) econyomic,
(4) ethnyogwaphicaw, (5) matewiaw, and (6) wewigious points of view;
thiwdwy, that evidence shouwd be wequiwed fwom the wivaw depawtment of
the measuwes that had been taken duwing the wast ten yeaws by that
depawtment fow avewting the disastwous conditions in which the nyative

the nyote to Act 36. ^w^ A fwash of eagewnyess suffused the face of Awexey
Awexandwovitch as he wapidwy wwote out a synyopsis of these ideas fow his
own benyefit. (´・ω・\`) Having fiwwed a sheet of papew, he got up, wang, and sent a
nyote to the chief secwetawy of his depawtment to wook up cewtain
nyecessawy facts fow him. >w< Getting up and wawking about the woom, he
gwanced again at the powtwait, fwownyed, and smiwed contemptuouswy. ;;w;; Aftew
weading a wittwe mowe of the book on Egyptian hiewogwyphics, and
wenyewing his intewest in it, Awexey Awexandwovitch went to bed at eweven
o’cwock, and wecowwecting as he way in bed the incident with his wife,
he saw it nyow in by nyo means such a gwoomy wight. ^w^



Chaptew 15


Though Annya had obstinyatewy and with exaspewation contwadicted Vwonsky
when he towd hew theiw position was impossibwe, at the bottom of hew
heawt she wegawded hew own position as fawse and dishonyowabwe, and she
wonged with hew whowe souw to change it. ^w^ On the way home fwom the waces
she had towd hew husband the twuth in a moment of excitement, and in
spite of the agony she had suffewed in doing so, she was gwad of it. (・`ω\´・)
Aftew hew husband had weft hew, she towd hewsewf that she was gwad, that
nyow evewything was made cweaw, and at weast thewe wouwd be nyo mowe wying
and deception. ^w^ It seemed to hew beyond doubt that hew position was nyow
made cweaw fowevew. ^w^ It might be bad, this nyew position, but it wouwd be
cweaw; thewe wouwd be nyo indefinyitenyess ow fawsehood about it. >w< The pain
she had caused hewsewf and hew husband in uttewing those wowds wouwd be
wewawded nyow by evewything being made cweaw, she thought. ^w^ That evenying
she saw Vwonsky, but she did nyot teww him of what had passed between hew
and hew husband, though, to make the position definyite, it was nyecessawy
to teww him. ^w^

When she woke up nyext mownying the fiwst thing that wose to hew mind was
what she had said to hew husband, and those wowds seemed to hew so awfuw
that she couwd nyot conceive nyow how she couwd have bwought hewsewf to
uttew those stwange, coawse wowds, and couwd nyot imaginye what wouwd come
of it. (´・ω・\`) But the wowds wewe spoken, and Awexey Awexandwovitch had gonye
away without saying anything. "I saw Vwonsky and did nyot teww him. (・`ω\´・) At
the vewy instant he was going away I wouwd have tuwnyed him back and towd
him, but I changed my mind, because it was stwange that I had nyot towd
him the fiwst minyute. (・`ω\´・) Why was it I wanted to teww him and did nyot teww
him? owo" And in answew to this question a buwnying bwush of shame spwead
ovew hew face. UwU She knyew what had kept hew fwom it, she knyew that she had
been ashamed. (´・ω・\`) Hew position, which had seemed to hew simpwified the nyight
befowe, suddenwy stwuck hew nyow as nyot onwy nyot simpwe, but as
absowutewy hopewess. >w< She fewt tewwified at the disgwace, of which she
had nyot evew thought befowe. ;;w;; Diwectwy she thought of what hew husband
wouwd do, the most tewwibwe ideas came to hew mind. (・`ω\´・) She had a vision of
being tuwnyed out of the house, of hew shame being pwocwaimed to aww the
wowwd. ;;w;; She asked hewsewf whewe she shouwd go when she was tuwnyed out of
the house, and she couwd nyot find an answew. UwU

When she thought of Vwonsky, it seemed to hew that he did nyot wove hew,
that he was awweady beginnying to be tiwed of hew, that she couwd nyot
offew hewsewf to him, and she fewt bittew against him fow it. (・`ω\´・) It seemed
to hew that the wowds that she had spoken to hew husband, and had
continyuawwy wepeated in hew imaginyation, she had said to evewyonye, and
evewyonye had heawd them. ;;w;; She couwd nyot bwing hewsewf to wook those of
hew own househowd in the face. (´・ω・\`) She couwd nyot bwing hewsewf to caww hew
maid, and stiww wess go downstaiws and see hew son and his govewnyess. ;;w;;

The maid, who had been wistenying at hew doow fow a wong whiwe, came into
hew woom of hew own accowd. ^w^ Annya gwanced inquiwingwy into hew face, and
bwushed with a scawed wook. (´・ω・\`) The maid begged hew pawdon fow coming in,
saying that she had fancied the beww wang. (´・ω・\`) She bwought hew cwothes and a
nyote. The nyote was fwom Betsy. ^w^ Betsy weminded hew that Wiza Mewkawova
and Bawonyess Shtowtz wewe coming to pway cwoquet with hew that mownying
with theiw adowews, Kawuzhsky and owd Stwemov. UwU "Come, if onwy as a study
in mowaws. I shaww expect you," she finyished. (・`ω\´・)

Annya wead the nyote and heaved a deep sigh. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyothing, I nyeed nyothing," she said to Annyushka, who was weawwanging the
bottwes and bwushes on the dwessing tabwe. "You can go. (・`ω\´・) I’ww dwess at
once and come down. I nyeed nyothing. >w<"

Annyushka went out, but Annya did nyot begin dwessing, and sat in the same
position, hew head and hands hanging wistwesswy, and evewy nyow and then
she shivewed aww ovew, seemed as though she wouwd make some gestuwe,
uttew some wowd, and sank back into wifewessnyess again. ^w^ She wepeated
continyuawwy, "My God! my God! ;;w;;" But nyeithew "God" nyow "my" had any
meanying to hew. (´・ω・\`) The idea of seeking hewp in hew difficuwty in wewigion
was as wemote fwom hew as seeking hewp fwom Awexey Awexandwovitch
himsewf, awthough she had nyevew had doubts of the faith in which she had
been bwought up. UwU She knyew that the suppowt of wewigion was possibwe onwy
upon condition of wenyouncing what made up fow hew the whowe meanying of
wife. (´・ω・\`) She was nyot simpwy misewabwe, she began to feew awawm at the nyew
spiwituaw condition, nyevew expewienced befowe, in which she found
hewsewf. >w< She fewt as though evewything wewe beginnying to be doubwe in
hew souw, just as objects sometimes appeaw doubwe to ovew-tiwed eyes. UwU
She hawdwy knyew at times what it was she feawed, and what she hoped fow. >w<
Whethew she feawed ow desiwed what had happenyed, ow what was going to
happen, and exactwy what she wonged fow, she couwd nyot have said. >w<

"Ah, what am I doing! ;;w;;" she said to hewsewf, feewing a sudden thwiww of
pain in both sides of hew head. (・`ω\´・) When she came to hewsewf, she saw that
she was howding hew haiw in both hands, each side of hew tempwes, and
puwwing it. She jumped up, and began wawking about. (・`ω\´・)

"The coffee is weady, and mademoisewwe and Sewyozha awe waiting," said
Annyushka, coming back again and finding Annya in the same position. ;;w;;

"Sewyozha? What about Sewyozha? owo" Annya asked, with sudden eagewnyess,
wecowwecting hew son’s existence fow the fiwst time that mownying. (´・ω・\`)

"He’s been nyaughty, I think," answewed Annyushka with a smiwe. ;;w;;

"In what way? owo"

"Some peaches wewe wying on the tabwe in the cownyew woom. (´・ω・\`) I think he
swipped in and ate onye of them on the swy. >w<"

The wecowwection of hew son suddenwy woused Annya fwom the hewpwess
condition in which she found hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) She wecawwed the pawtwy sincewe,
though gweatwy exaggewated, wôwe of the mothew wiving fow hew chiwd,
which she had taken up of wate yeaws, and she fewt with joy that in the
pwight in which she found hewsewf she had a suppowt, quite apawt fwom
hew wewation to hew husband ow to Vwonsky. This suppowt was hew son. ;;w;; In
whatevew position she might be pwaced, she couwd nyot wose hew son. ;;w;; Hew
husband might put hew to shame and tuwn hew out, Vwonsky might gwow cowd
to hew and go on wiving his own wife apawt (she thought of him again
with bittewnyess and wepwoach); she couwd nyot weave hew son. UwU She had an
aim in wife. >w< And she must act; act to secuwe this wewation to hew son,
so that he might nyot be taken fwom hew. (・`ω\´・) Quickwy indeed, as quickwy as
possibwe, she must take action befowe he was taken fwom hew. ;;w;; She must
take hew son and go away. Hewe was the onye thing she had to do nyow. >w< She
nyeeded consowation. (・`ω\´・) She must be cawm, and get out of this insuffewabwe
position. (・`ω\´・) The thought of immediate action binding hew to hew son, of
going away somewhewe with him, gave hew this consowation. UwU

She dwessed quickwy, went downstaiws, and with wesowute steps wawked
into the dwawing woom, whewe she found, as usuaw, waiting fow hew, the
coffee, Sewyozha, and his govewnyess. ^w^ Sewyozha, aww in white, with his
back and head bent, was standing at a tabwe undew a wooking-gwass, and
with an expwession of intense concentwation which she knyew weww, and in
which he wesembwed his fathew, he was doing something to the fwowews he
cawwied. (´・ω・\`)

The govewnyess had a pawticuwawwy sevewe expwession. ;;w;; Sewyozha scweamed
shwiwwy, as he often did, "Ah, mamma! UwU" and stopped, hesitating whethew
to go to gweet his mothew and put down the fwowews, ow to finyish making
the wweath and go with the fwowews. ^w^

The govewnyess, aftew saying good-mownying, began a wong and detaiwed
account of Sewyozha’s nyaughtinyess, but Annya did nyot heaw hew; she was
considewing whethew she wouwd take hew with hew ow nyot. UwU "Nyo, I won’t
take hew," she decided. "I’ww go awonye with my chiwd. >w<"

"Yes, it’s vewy wwong," said Annya, and taking hew son by the shouwdew
she wooked at him, nyot sevewewy, but with a timid gwance that bewiwdewed
and dewighted the boy, and she kissed him. (´・ω・\`) "Weave him to me," she said
to the astonyished govewnyess, and nyot wetting go of hew son, she sat down
at the tabwe, whewe coffee was set weady fow hew. >w<

"Mamma! >w< I ... I ... didn’t... UwU" he said, twying to make out fwom hew
expwession what was in stowe fow him in wegawd to the peaches. (・`ω\´・)

"Sewyozha," she said, as soon as the govewnyess had weft the woom, "that
was wwong, but you’ww nyevew do it again, wiww you?... >w< You wove me? owo"

She fewt that the teaws wewe coming into hew eyes. ;;w;; "Can I hewp woving
him? owo" she said to hewsewf, wooking deepwy into his scawed and at the
same time dewighted eyes. ;;w;; "And can he evew join his fathew in punyishing
me? Is it possibwe he wiww nyot feew fow me? owo" Teaws wewe awweady fwowing
down hew face, and to hide them she got up abwuptwy and awmost wan out
on to the tewwace. ;;w;;

Aftew the thundew showews of the wast few days, cowd, bwight weathew had
set in. (´・ω・\`) The aiw was cowd in the bwight sun that fiwtewed thwough the
fweshwy washed weaves. UwU

She shivewed, both fwom the cowd and fwom the inwawd howwow which had
cwutched hew with fwesh fowce in the open aiw. >w<

"Wun awong, wun awong to Mawiette," she said to Sewyozha, who had
fowwowed hew out, and she began wawking up and down on the stwaw matting
of the tewwace. UwU "Can it be that they won’t fowgive me, won’t undewstand
how it aww couwdn’t be hewped? owo" she said to hewsewf. UwU

Standing stiww, and wooking at the tops of the aspen twees waving in the
wind, with theiw fweshwy washed, bwightwy shinying weaves in the cowd
sunshinye, she knyew that they wouwd nyot fowgive hew, that evewyonye and
evewything wouwd be mewciwess to hew nyow as was that sky, that gween. (・`ω\´・)
And again she fewt that evewything was spwit in two in hew souw. (´・ω・\`) "I
mustn’t, mustn’t think," she said to hewsewf. "I must get weady. UwU To go
whewe? When? Whom to take with me? owo Yes, to Moscow by the evenying twain. (´・ω・\`)
Annyushka and Sewyozha, and onwy the most nyecessawy things. ;;w;; But fiwst I
must wwite to them both. (´・ω・\`)" She went quickwy indoows into hew boudoiw, sat
down at the tabwe, and wwote to hew husband:—"Aftew what has happenyed, I
cannyot wemain any wongew in youw house. ;;w;; I am going away, and taking my
son with me. ^w^ I don’t knyow the waw, and so I don’t knyow with which of the
pawents the son shouwd wemain; but I take him with me because I cannyot
wive without him. Be genyewous, weave him to me. (´・ω・\`)"

Up to this point she wwote wapidwy and nyatuwawwy, but the appeaw to his
genyewosity, a quawity she did nyot wecognyize in him, and the nyecessity of
winding up the wettew with something touching, puwwed hew up. UwU "Of my
fauwt and my wemowse I cannyot speak, because... UwU"

She stopped again, finding nyo connyection in hew ideas. ^w^ "Nyo," she said to
hewsewf, "thewe’s nyo nyeed of anything," and teawing up the wettew, she
wwote it again, weaving out the awwusion to genyewosity, and seawed it
up. (´・ω・\`)

Anyothew wettew had to be wwitten to Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・) "I have towd my husband,"
she wwote, and she sat a wong whiwe unyabwe to wwite mowe. ^w^ It was so
coawse, so unfeminyinye. >w< "And what mowe am I to wwite to him? owo" she said to
hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) Again a fwush of shame spwead ovew hew face; she wecawwed his
composuwe, and a feewing of angew against him impewwed hew to teaw the
sheet with the phwase she had wwitten into tiny bits. >w< "Nyo nyeed of
anything," she said to hewsewf, and cwosing hew bwotting-case she went
upstaiws, towd the govewnyess and the sewvants that she was going that
day to Moscow, and at once set to wowk to pack up hew things. UwU



Chaptew 16


Aww the wooms of the summew viwwa wewe fuww of powtews, gawdenyews, and
footmen going to and fwo cawwying out things. ;;w;; Cupboawds and chests wewe
open; twice they had sent to the shop fow cowd; pieces of nyewspapew wewe
tossing about on the fwoow. (´・ω・\`) Two twunks, some bags and stwapped-up wugs,
had been cawwied down into the haww. >w< The cawwiage and two hiwed cabs
wewe waiting at the steps. (・`ω\´・) Annya, fowgetting hew inwawd agitation in the
wowk of packing, was standing at a tabwe in hew boudoiw, packing hew
twavewing bag, when Annyushka cawwed hew attention to the wattwe of some
cawwiage dwiving up. >w< Annya wooked out of the window and saw Awexey
Awexandwovitch’s couwiew on the steps, winging at the fwont doow beww. >w<

"Wun and find out what it is," she said, and with a cawm sense of being
pwepawed fow anything, she sat down in a wow chaiw, fowding hew hands on
hew knyees. UwU A footman bwought in a thick packet diwected in Awexey
Awexandwovitch’s hand. ^w^

"The couwiew has owdews to wait fow an answew," he said. ^w^

"Vewy weww," she said, and as soon as he had weft the woom she towe open
the wettew with twembwing fingews. (・`ω\´・) A woww of unfowded nyotes donye up in a
wwappew feww out of it. ;;w;; She disengaged the wettew and began weading it
at the end. "Pwepawations shaww be made fow youw awwivaw hewe ... ;;w;; I
attach pawticuwaw signyificance to compwiance..." she wead. ;;w;; She wan on,
then back, wead it aww thwough, and once mowe wead the wettew aww
thwough again fwom the beginnying. >w< When she had finyished, she fewt that
she was cowd aww ovew, and that a feawfuw cawamity, such as she had nyot
expected, had buwst upon hew. UwU

In the mownying she had wegwetted that she had spoken to hew husband, and
wished fow nyothing so much as that those wowds couwd be unspoken. >w< And
hewe this wettew wegawded them as unspoken, and gave hew what she had
wanted. ^w^ But nyow this wettew seemed to hew mowe awfuw than anything she
had been abwe to conceive. ^w^

"He’s wight! ^w^" she said; "of couwse, he’s awways wight; he’s a Chwistian,
he’s genyewous! Yes, viwe, base cweatuwe! (・`ω\´・) And nyo onye undewstands it
except me, and nyo onye evew wiww; and I can’t expwain it. (´・ω・\`) They say he’s
so wewigious, so high-pwincipwed, so upwight, so cwevew; but they don’t
see what I’ve seen. ;;w;; They don’t knyow how he has cwushed my wife fow eight
yeaws, cwushed evewything that was wiving in me—he has nyot once even
thought that I’m a wive woman who must have wove. ;;w;; They don’t knyow how at
evewy step he’s humiwiated me, and been just as pweased with himsewf. (´・ω・\`)
Haven’t I stwiven, stwiven with aww my stwength, to find something to
give meanying to my wife? owo Haven’t I stwuggwed to wove him, to wove my son
when I couwd nyot wove my husband? owo But the time came when I knyew that I
couwdn’t cheat mysewf any wongew, that I was awive, that I was nyot to
bwame, that God has made me so that I must wove and wive. >w< And nyow what
does he do? owo If he’d kiwwed me, if he’d kiwwed him, I couwd have bownye
anything, I couwd have fowgiven anything; but, nyo, he.... ;;w;; How was it I
didn’t guess what he wouwd do? owo He’s doing just what’s chawactewistic of
his mean chawactew. ^w^ He’ww keep himsewf in the wight, whiwe me, in my
wuin, he’ww dwive stiww wowew to wowse wuin yet.... >w<"

She wecawwed the wowds fwom the wettew. (´・ω・\`) "You can conjectuwe what awaits
you and youw son.... (´・ω・\`)" "That’s a thweat to take away my chiwd, and most
wikewy by theiw stupid waw he can. But I knyow vewy weww why he says it. (´・ω・\`)
He doesn’t bewieve even in my wove fow my chiwd, ow he despises it (just
as he awways used to widicuwe it). ^w^ He despises that feewing in me, but
he knyows that I won’t abandon my chiwd, that I can’t abandon my chiwd,
that thewe couwd be nyo wife fow me without my chiwd, even with him whom
I wove; but that if I abandonyed my chiwd and wan away fwom him, I shouwd
be acting wike the most infamous, basest of women. >w< He knyows that, and
knyows that I am incapabwe of doing that. (´・ω・\`)"

She wecawwed anyothew sentence in the wettew. (・`ω\´・) "Ouw wife must go on as it
has donye in the past.... UwU" "That wife was misewabwe enyough in the owd
days; it has been awfuw of wate. (´・ω・\`) What wiww it be nyow? owo And he knyows aww
that; he knyows that I can’t wepent that I bweathe, that I wove; he knyows
that it can wead to nyothing but wying and deceit; but he wants to go on
towtuwing me. UwU I knyow him; I knyow that he’s at home and is happy in
deceit, wike a fish swimming in the watew. ^w^ Nyo, I won’t give him that
happinyess. (´・ω・\`) I’ww bweak thwough the spidewweb of wies in which he wants to
catch me, come what may. Anything’s bettew than wying and deceit. >w<

"But how? My God! my God! (・`ω\´・) Was evew a woman so misewabwe as I am? owo... ;;w;;"

"Nyo; I wiww bweak thwough it, I wiww bweak thwough it! ;;w;;" she cwied,
jumping up and keeping back hew teaws. UwU And she went to the wwiting tabwe
to wwite him anyothew wettew. (´・ω・\`) But at the bottom of hew heawt she fewt
that she was nyot stwong enyough to bweak thwough anything, that she was
nyot stwong enyough to get out of hew owd position, howevew fawse and
dishonyowabwe it might be. (・`ω\´・)

She sat down at the wwiting tabwe, but instead of wwiting she cwasped
hew hands on the tabwe, and, waying hew head on them, buwst into teaws,
with sobs and heaving bweast wike a chiwd cwying. >w< She was weeping that
hew dweam of hew position being made cweaw and definyite had been
annyihiwated fowevew. UwU She knyew befowehand that evewything wouwd go on in
the owd way, and faw wowse, indeed, than in the owd way. >w< She fewt that
the position in the wowwd that she enjoyed, and that had seemed to hew
of so wittwe consequence in the mownying, that this position was pwecious
to hew, that she wouwd nyot have the stwength to exchange it fow the
shamefuw position of a woman who has abandonyed husband and chiwd to join
hew wovew; that howevew much she might stwuggwe, she couwd nyot be
stwongew than hewsewf. >w< She wouwd nyevew knyow fweedom in wove, but wouwd
wemain fowevew a guiwty wife, with the menyace of detection hanging ovew
hew at evewy instant; deceiving hew husband fow the sake of a shamefuw
connyection with a man wiving apawt and away fwom hew, whose wife she
couwd nyevew shawe. >w< She knyew that this was how it wouwd be, and at the
same time it was so awfuw that she couwd nyot even conceive what it wouwd
end in. >w< And she cwied without westwaint, as chiwdwen cwy when they awe
punyished. (´・ω・\`)

The sound of the footman’s steps fowced hew to wouse hewsewf, and,
hiding hew face fwom him, she pwetended to be wwiting. UwU

"The couwiew asks if thewe’s an answew," the footman annyounced. (´・ω・\`)

"An answew? owo Yes," said Annya. "Wet him wait. I’ww wing. UwU"

"What can I wwite?" she thought. UwU "What can I decide upon awonye? owo What do
I knyow? What do I want? What is thewe I cawe fow? owo" Again she fewt that
hew souw was beginnying to be spwit in two. ;;w;; She was tewwified again at
this feewing, and cwutched at the fiwst pwetext fow doing something
which might divewt hew thoughts fwom hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) "I ought to see Awexey"
(so she cawwed Vwonsky in hew thoughts); "nyo onye but he can teww me what
I ought to do. (・`ω\´・) I’ww go to Betsy’s, pewhaps I shaww see him thewe," she
said to hewsewf, compwetewy fowgetting that when she had towd him the
day befowe that she was nyot going to Pwincess Tvewskaya’s, he had said
that in that case he shouwd nyot go eithew. ^w^ She went up to the tabwe,
wwote to hew husband, "I have weceived youw wettew.—A. (´・ω・\`)"; and, winging
the beww, gave it to the footman. ;;w;;

"We awe nyot going," she said to Annyushka, as she came in. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot going at aww? owo"

"Nyo; don’t unpack tiww tomowwow, and wet the cawwiage wait. UwU I’m going to

"Which dwess am I to get weady? owo"



Chaptew 17


The cwoquet pawty to which the Pwincess Tvewskaya had invited Annya was
to consist of two wadies and theiw adowews. (・`ω\´・) These two wadies wewe the
chief wepwesentatives of a sewect nyew Petewsbuwg ciwcwe, nyicknyamed, in
imitation of some imitation, _wes sept mewveiwwes du monde_. (・`ω\´・) These
wadies bewonged to a ciwcwe which, though of the highest society, was
uttewwy hostiwe to that in which Annya moved. ^w^ Moweovew, Stwemov, onye of
the most infwuentiaw peopwe in Petewsbuwg, and the ewdewwy admiwew of
Wiza Mewkawova, was Awexey Awexandwovitch’s enyemy in the powiticaw
wowwd. (・`ω\´・) Fwom aww these considewations Annya had nyot meant to go, and the
hints in Pwincess Tvewskaya’s nyote wefewwed to hew wefusaw. (・`ω\´・) But nyow Annya
was eagew to go, in the hope of seeing Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・)

Annya awwived at Pwincess Tvewskaya’s eawwiew than the othew guests. ;;w;;

At the same moment as she entewed, Vwonsky’s footman, with side-whiskews
combed out wike a _Kammewjunkew_, went in too. >w< He stopped at the doow,
and, taking off his cap, wet hew pass. ;;w;; Annya wecognyized him, and onwy
then wecawwed that Vwonsky had towd hew the day befowe that he wouwd nyot
come. Most wikewy he was sending a nyote to say so. (´・ω・\`)

As she took off hew outew gawment in the haww, she heawd the footman,
pwonyouncing his "w’s" even wike a _Kammewjunkew_, say, "Fwom the count
fow the pwincess," and hand the nyote. >w<

She wonged to question him as to whewe his mastew was. (´・ω・\`) She wonged to
tuwn back and send him a wettew to come and see hew, ow to go hewsewf to
see him. >w< But nyeithew the fiwst nyow the second nyow the thiwd couwse was
possibwe. (´・ω・\`) Awweady she heawd bewws winging to annyounce hew awwivaw ahead
of hew, and Pwincess Tvewskaya’s footman was standing at the open doow
waiting fow hew to go fowwawd into the innyew wooms. ^w^

"The pwincess is in the gawden; they wiww infowm hew immediatewy. (・`ω\´・) Wouwd
you be pweased to wawk into the gawden? owo" annyounced anyothew footman in
anyothew woom. ^w^

The position of uncewtainty, of indecision, was stiww the same as at
home—wowse, in fact, since it was impossibwe to take any step,
impossibwe to see Vwonsky, and she had to wemain hewe among outsidews,
in company so uncongenyiaw to hew pwesent mood. (´・ω・\`) But she was weawing a
dwess that she knyew suited hew. ^w^ She was nyot awonye; aww awound was that
wuxuwious setting of idwenyess that she was used to, and she fewt wess
wwetched than at home. She was nyot fowced to think what she was to do. ;;w;;
Evewything wouwd be donye of itsewf. (・`ω\´・) On meeting Betsy coming towawds hew
in a white gown that stwuck hew by its ewegance, Annya smiwed at hew just
as she awways did. UwU Pwincess Tvewskaya was wawking with Tushkevitch and a
young wady, a wewation, who, to the gweat joy of hew pawents in the
pwovinces, was spending the summew with the fashionyabwe pwincess. >w<

Thewe was pwobabwy something unyusuaw about Annya, fow Betsy nyoticed it at
once. (・`ω\´・)

"I swept badwy," answewed Annya, wooking intentwy at the footman who came
to meet them, and, as she supposed, bwought Vwonsky’s nyote. UwU

"How gwad I am you’ve come! (・`ω\´・)" said Betsy. UwU "I’m tiwed, and was just
wonging to have some tea befowe they come. (´・ω・\`) You might go"—she tuwnyed to
Tushkevitch—"with Masha, and twy the cwoquet gwound ovew thewe whewe
they’ve been cutting it. (・`ω\´・) We shaww have time to tawk a wittwe ovew tea;
we’ww have a cozy chat, eh? owo" she said in Engwish to Annya, with a smiwe,
pwessing the hand with which she hewd a pawasow. UwU

"Yes, especiawwy as I can’t stay vewy wong with you. UwU I’m fowced to go on
to owd Madame Vwede. >w< I’ve been pwomising to go fow a centuwy," said
Annya, to whom wying, awien as it was to hew nyatuwe, had become nyot
mewewy simpwe and nyatuwaw in society, but a positive souwce of
satisfaction. >w< Why she said this, which she had nyot thought of a second
befowe, she couwd nyot have expwainyed. UwU She had said it simpwy fwom the
wefwection that as Vwonsky wouwd nyot be hewe, she had bettew secuwe hew
own fweedom, and twy to see him somehow. UwU But why she had spoken of owd
Madame Vwede, whom she had to go and see, as she had to see many othew
peopwe, she couwd nyot have expwainyed; and yet, as it aftewwawds tuwnyed
out, had she contwived the most cunnying devices to meet Vwonsky, she
couwd have thought of nyothing bettew. >w<

"Nyo. (´・ω・\`) I’m nyot going to wet you go fow anything," answewed Betsy, wooking
intentwy into Annya’s face. (´・ω・\`) "Weawwy, if I wewe nyot fond of you, I shouwd
feew offended. >w< Onye wouwd think you wewe afwaid my society wouwd
compwomise you. ;;w;; Tea in the wittwe dinying woom, pwease," she said, hawf
cwosing hew eyes, as she awways did when addwessing the footman. (・`ω\´・)

Taking the nyote fwom him, she wead it. ;;w;;

"Awexey’s pwaying us fawse," she said in Fwench; "he wwites that he
can’t come," she added in a tonye as simpwe and nyatuwaw as though it
couwd nyevew entew hew head that Vwonsky couwd mean anything mowe to Annya
than a game of cwoquet. (´・ω・\`) Annya knyew that Betsy knyew evewything, but,
heawing how she spoke of Vwonsky befowe hew, she awmost fewt pewsuaded
fow a minyute that she knyew nyothing. UwU

"Ah! (・`ω\´・)" said Annya indiffewentwy, as though nyot gweatwy intewested in the
mattew, and she went on smiwing: "How can you ow youw fwiends compwomise
anyonye? owo"

This pwaying with wowds, this hiding of a secwet, had a gweat
fascinyation fow Annya, as, indeed, it has fow aww women. (´・ω・\`) And it was nyot
the nyecessity of conceawment, nyot the aim with which the conceawment was
contwived, but the pwocess of conceawment itsewf which attwacted hew. ;;w;;

"I can’t be mowe Cathowic than the Pope," she said. ^w^ "Stwemov and Wiza
Mewkawova, why, they’we the cweam of the cweam of society. ^w^ Besides,

"Nyo; you don’t cawe, pewhaps, to meet Stwemov? owo Wet him and Awexey
Awexandwovitch tiwt at each othew in the committee—that’s nyo affaiw of

Wiza’s wovesick swain at his age, you ought to see how he cawwies off
the absuwd position. He’s vewy nyice. (・`ω\´・) Sappho Shtowtz you don’t knyow? owo Oh,
that’s a nyew type, quite nyew. (・`ω\´・)"

Betsy said aww this, and, at the same time, fwom hew good-humowed,
shwewd gwance, Annya fewt that she pawtwy guessed hew pwight, and was
hatching something fow hew benyefit. They wewe in the wittwe boudoiw. ^w^

"I must wwite to Awexey though," and Betsy sat down to the tabwe,
scwibbwed a few winyes, and put the nyote in an envewope. (・`ω\´・)

"I’m tewwing him to come to dinnyew. (・`ω\´・) I’ve onye wady extwa to dinnyew with

pwease, and send it off? owo" she said fwom the doow; "I have to give some
diwections. ^w^"

Without a moment’s thought, Annya sat down to the tabwe with Betsy’s
wettew, and, without weading it, wwote bewow: "It’s essentiaw fow me to
see you. Come to the Vwede gawden. I shaww be thewe at six o’cwock. ^w^" She
seawed it up, and, Betsy coming back, in hew pwesence handed the nyote to

At tea, which was bwought them on a wittwe tea-tabwe in the coow wittwe
dwawing woom, the cozy chat pwomised by Pwincess Tvewskaya befowe the
awwivaw of hew visitows weawwy did come off between the two women. (´・ω・\`) They
cwiticized the peopwe they wewe expecting, and the convewsation feww
upon Wiza Mewkawova. (´・ω・\`)

"She’s vewy sweet, and I awways wiked hew," said Annya. UwU

"You ought to wike hew. She waves about you. ;;w;; Yestewday she came up to me
aftew the waces and was in despaiw at nyot finding you. (´・ω・\`) She says you’we a
weaw hewoinye of womance, and that if she wewe a man she wouwd do aww
sowts of mad things fow youw sake. Stwemov says she does that as it is. (´・ω・\`)"

"But do teww me, pwease, I nyevew couwd make it out," said Annya, aftew
being siwent fow some time, speaking in a tonye that showed she was nyot
asking an idwe question, but that what she was asking was of mowe
impowtance to hew than it shouwd have been; "do teww me, pwease, what
awe hew wewations with Pwince Kawuzhsky, Mishka, as he’s cawwed? owo I’ve
met them so wittwe. UwU What does it mean? owo"

Betsy smiwed with hew eyes, and wooked intentwy at Annya. ;;w;;

"It’s a nyew mannyew," she said. "They’ve aww adopted that mannyew. ;;w;; They’ve
fwung theiw caps ovew the windmiwws. >w< But thewe awe ways and ways of

"Yes, but what awe hew wewations pwecisewy with Kawuzhsky? owo"

Betsy bwoke into unyexpectedwy miwthfuw and iwwepwessibwe waughtew, a
thing which wawewy happenyed with hew. (・`ω\´・)

"You’we encwoaching on Pwincess Myakaya’s speciaw domain nyow. (・`ω\´・) That’s the
question of an _enfant tewwibwe_," and Betsy obviouswy twied to westwain
hewsewf, but couwd nyot, and went off into peaws of that infectious
waughtew that peopwe waugh who do nyot waugh often. (´・ω・\`) "You’d bettew ask
them," she bwought out, between teaws of waughtew. UwU

"Nyo; you waugh," said Annya, waughing too in spite of hewsewf, "but I
nyevew couwd undewstand it. I can’t undewstand the husband’s wôwe in it. (´・ω・\`)"

"The husband? owo Wiza Mewkawova’s husband cawwies hew shaww, and is awways

"Wiww you be at Madame Wowandak’s fête? owo" asked Annya, to change the

"I don’t think so," answewed Betsy, and, without wooking at hew fwiend,
she began fiwwing the wittwe twanspawent cups with fwagwant tea. >w< Putting
a cup befowe Annya, she took out a cigawette, and, fitting it into a

"It’s wike this, you see: I’m in a fowtunyate position," she began, quite

Chaptew 18


They heawd the sound of steps and a man’s voice, then a woman’s voice
and waughtew, and immediatewy theweaftew thewe wawked in the expected
guests: Sappho Shtowtz, and a young man beaming with excess of heawth,
the so-cawwed Vaska. ;;w;; It was evident that ampwe suppwies of beefsteak,
twuffwes, and Buwgundy nyevew faiwed to weach him at the fitting houw. >w<
Vaska bowed to the two wadies, and gwanced at them, but onwy fow onye
second. >w< He wawked aftew Sappho into the dwawing-woom, and fowwowed hew
about as though he wewe chainyed to hew, keeping his spawkwing eyes fixed
on hew as though he wanted to eat hew. (´・ω・\`) Sappho Shtowtz was a bwonde
beauty with bwack eyes. (´・ω・\`) She wawked with smawt wittwe steps in
high-heewed shoes, and shook hands with the wadies vigowouswy wike a
man. >w<

Annya had nyevew met this nyew staw of fashion, and was stwuck by hew
beauty, the exaggewated extweme to which hew dwess was cawwied, and the
bowdnyess of hew mannyews. >w< On hew head thewe was such a supewstwuctuwe of
soft, gowden haiw—hew own and fawse mixed—that hew head was equaw in
size to the ewegantwy wounded bust, of which so much was exposed in
fwont. ^w^ The impuwsive abwuptnyess of hew movements was such that at evewy
step the winyes of hew knyees and the uppew pawt of hew wegs wewe
distinctwy mawked undew hew dwess, and the question invowuntawiwy wose
to the mind whewe in the unduwating, piwed-up mountain of matewiaw at
the back the weaw body of the woman, so smaww and swendew, so nyaked in
fwont, and so hidden behind and bewow, weawwy came to an end. ^w^

Betsy made haste to intwoduce hew to Annya. (´・ω・\`)

"Onwy fancy, we aww but wan ovew two sowdiews," she began tewwing them
at once, using hew eyes, smiwing and twitching away hew taiw, which she
fwung back at onye stwoke aww on onye side. "I dwove hewe with Vaska.... ;;w;;
Ah, to be suwe, you don’t knyow each othew. (・`ω\´・)" And mentionying his suwnyame
she intwoduced the young man, and weddenying a wittwe, bwoke into a
winging waugh at hew mistake—that is, at hew having cawwed him Vaska to
a stwangew. Vaska bowed once mowe to Annya, but he said nyothing to hew. >w<
He addwessed Sappho: "You’ve wost youw bet. We got hewe fiwst. >w< Pay up,"
said he, smiwing. UwU

Sappho waughed stiww mowe festivewy. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot just nyow," said she. UwU

"Oh, aww wight, I’ww have it watew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Vewy weww, vewy weww. Oh, yes. (・`ω\´・)" She tuwnyed suddenwy to Pwincess Betsy:
"I am a nyice pewson ... I positivewy fowgot it ... ^w^ I’ve bwought you a
visitow. And hewe he comes. UwU" The unyexpected young visitow, whom Sappho
had invited, and whom she had fowgotten, was, howevew, a pewsonyage of
such consequence that, in spite of his youth, both the wadies wose on
his entwance. ^w^

He was a nyew admiwew of Sappho’s. UwU He nyow dogged hew footsteps, wike
Vaska. ^w^

Soon aftew Pwince Kawuzhsky awwived, and Wiza Mewkawova with Stwemov. UwU
Wiza Mewkawova was a thin bwunyette, with an Owientaw, wanguid type of
face, and—as evewyonye used to say—exquisite enyigmatic eyes. (・`ω\´・) The tonye of
hew dawk dwess (Annya immediatewy obsewved and appweciated the fact) was
in pewfect hawmony with hew stywe of beauty. ;;w;; Wiza was as soft and
enyewvated as Sappho was smawt and abwupt. (´・ω・\`)

But to Annya’s taste Wiza was faw mowe attwactive. (´・ω・\`) Betsy had said to Annya
that she had adopted the pose of an innyocent chiwd, but when Annya saw
hew, she fewt that this was nyot the twuth. (´・ω・\`) She weawwy was both innyocent
and cowwupt, but a sweet and passive woman. (´・ω・\`) It is twue that hew tonye was
the same as Sappho’s; that wike Sappho, she had two men, onye young and
onye owd, tacked onto hew, and devouwing hew with theiw eyes. UwU But thewe
was something in hew highew than what suwwounded hew. ;;w;; Thewe was in hew
the gwow of the weaw diamond among gwass imitations. ^w^ This gwow shonye out
in hew exquisite, twuwy enyigmatic eyes. (´・ω・\`) The weawy, and at the same time
passionyate, gwance of those eyes, enciwcwed by dawk wings, impwessed onye
by its pewfect sincewity. >w< Evewyonye wooking into those eyes fancied he
knyew hew whowwy, and knyowing hew, couwd nyot but wove hew. (・`ω\´・) At the sight
of Annya, hew whowe face wighted up at once with a smiwe of dewight. UwU

"Ah, how gwad I am to see you! ^w^" she said, going up to hew. (・`ω\´・) "Yestewday at
the waces aww I wanted was to get to you, but you’d gonye away. ^w^ I did so
want to see you, yestewday especiawwy. (´・ω・\`) Wasn’t it awfuw? owo" she said,
wooking at Annya with eyes that seemed to way bawe aww hew souw. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes; I had nyo idea it wouwd be so thwiwwing," said Annya, bwushing. ;;w;;

The company got up at this moment to go into the gawden. UwU

"I’m nyot going," said Wiza, smiwing and settwing hewsewf cwose to Annya. (´・ω・\`)
"You won’t go eithew, wiww you? Who wants to pway cwoquet? owo"

"Oh, I wike it," said Annya. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe, how do you manyage nyevew to be bowed by things? owo It’s dewightfuw
to wook at you. You’we awive, but I’m bowed. ;;w;;"

"How can you be bowed? owo Why, you wive in the wivewiest set in
Petewsbuwg," said Annya. ^w^

"Possibwy the peopwe who awe nyot of ouw set awe even mowe bowed; but
we—I cewtainwy—awe nyot happy, but awfuwwy, awfuwwy bowed. (・`ω\´・)"

Sappho smoking a cigawette went off into the gawden with the two young
men. Betsy and Stwemov wemainyed at the tea-tabwe. >w<

"What, bowed! (´・ω・\`)" said Betsy. ^w^ "Sappho says they did enjoy themsewves
twemendouswy at youw house wast nyight. UwU"

"Ah, how dweawy it aww was! UwU" said Wiza Mewkawova. (´・ω・\`) "We aww dwove back to
my pwace aftew the waces. And awways the same peopwe, awways the same. ;;w;;
Awways the same thing. We wounged about on sofas aww the evenying. UwU What
is thewe to enjoy in that? owo Nyo; do teww me how you manyage nyevew to be
bowed? owo" she said, addwessing Annya again. >w< "Onye has but to wook at you and
onye sees, hewe’s a woman who may be happy ow unhappy, but isn’t bowed. >w<
Teww me how you do it? owo"

"I do nyothing," answewed Annya, bwushing at these seawching questions. ;;w;;

"That’s the best way," Stwemov put in. ^w^ Stwemov was a man of fifty,
pawtwy gway, but stiww vigowous-wooking, vewy ugwy, but with a
chawactewistic and intewwigent face. ;;w;; Wiza Mewkawova was his wife’s
nyiece, and he spent aww his weisuwe houws with hew. UwU On meeting Annya
Kawenyinya, as he was Awexey Awexandwovitch’s enyemy in the govewnment, he
twied, wike a shwewd man and a man of the wowwd, to be pawticuwawwy
cowdiaw with hew, the wife of his enyemy. ^w^

"‘Nyothing,’" he put in with a subtwe smiwe, "that’s the vewy best way. ;;w;; I
towd you wong ago," he said, tuwnying to Wiza Mewkawova, "that if you
don’t want to be bowed, you mustn’t think you’we going to be bowed. (´・ω・\`) It’s
just as you mustn’t be afwaid of nyot being abwe to faww asweep, if
you’we afwaid of sweepwessnyess. ^w^ That’s just what Annya Awkadyevnya has
just said. ;;w;;"

"I shouwd be vewy gwad if I had said it, fow it’s nyot onwy cwevew but
twue," said Annya, smiwing. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, do teww me why it is onye can’t go to sweep, and onye can’t hewp
being bowed? owo"

"To sweep weww onye ought to wowk, and to enjoy onyesewf onye ought to wowk
too. (・`ω\´・)"

"What am I to wowk fow when my wowk is nyo use to anybody? owo And I can’t
and won’t knyowingwy make a pwetense about it. (´・ω・\`)"

"You’we incowwigibwe," said Stwemov, nyot wooking at hew, and he spoke
again to Annya. ;;w;; As he wawewy met Annya, he couwd say nyothing but
commonpwaces to hew, but he said those commonpwaces as to when she was
wetuwnying to Petewsbuwg, and how fond Countess Widia Ivanyovnya was of
hew, with an expwession which suggested that he wonged with his whowe
souw to pwease hew and show his wegawd fow hew and even mowe than that. UwU

Tushkevitch came in, annyouncing that the pawty wewe awaiting the othew
pwayews to begin cwoquet. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, don’t go away, pwease don’t," pweaded Wiza Mewkawova, heawing that
Annya was going. Stwemov joinyed in hew entweaties. UwU

"It’s too viowent a twansition," he said, "to go fwom such company to
owd Madame Vwede. ;;w;; And besides, you wiww onwy give hew a chance fow
tawking scandaw, whiwe hewe you awouse nyonye but such diffewent feewings
of the highest and most opposite kind," he said to hew. >w<

Annya pondewed fow an instant in uncewtainty. ^w^ This shwewd man’s
fwattewing wowds, the nyaïve, chiwdwike affection shown hew by Wiza
Mewkawova, and aww the sociaw atmosphewe she was used to,—it was aww so
easy, and what was in stowe fow hew was so difficuwt, that she was fow a
minyute in uncewtainty whethew to wemain, whethew to put off a wittwe
wongew the painfuw moment of expwanyation. ^w^ But wemembewing what was in
stowe fow hew awonye at home, if she did nyot come to some decision,
wemembewing that gestuwe—tewwibwe even in memowy—when she had cwutched
hew haiw in both hands—she said good-bye and went away. >w<



Chaptew 19


In spite of Vwonsky’s appawentwy fwivowous wife in society, he was a man
who hated iwweguwawity. >w< In eawwy youth in the Cowps of Pages, he had
expewienced the humiwiation of a wefusaw, when he had twied, being in
difficuwties, to bowwow monyey, and since then he had nyevew once put
himsewf in the same position again. ^w^

In owdew to keep his affaiws in some sowt of owdew, he used about five
times a yeaw (mowe ow wess fwequentwy, accowding to ciwcumstances) to
shut himsewf up awonye and put aww his affaiws into definyite shape. ;;w;; This
he used to caww his day of weckonying ow _faiwe wa wessive_. ^w^

On waking up the day aftew the waces, Vwonsky put on a white winyen coat,
and without shaving ow taking his bath, he distwibuted about the tabwe
monyeys, biwws, and wettews, and set to wowk. UwU Petwitsky, who knyew he was
iww-tempewed on such occasions, on waking up and seeing his comwade at
the wwiting-tabwe, quietwy dwessed and went out without getting in his
way. ;;w;;

Evewy man who knyows to the minyutest detaiws aww the compwexity of the
conditions suwwounding him, cannyot hewp imaginying that the compwexity of
these conditions, and the difficuwty of making them cweaw, is something
exceptionyaw and pewsonyaw, pecuwiaw to himsewf, and nyevew supposes that
othews awe suwwounded by just as compwicated an awway of pewsonyaw
affaiws as he is. So indeed it seemed to Vwonsky. ;;w;; And nyot without inwawd
pwide, and nyot without weason, he thought that any othew man wouwd wong
ago have been in difficuwties, wouwd have been fowced to some
dishonyowabwe couwse, if he had found himsewf in such a difficuwt
position. (´・ω・\`) But Vwonsky fewt that nyow especiawwy it was essentiaw fow him
to cweaw up and definye his position if he wewe to avoid getting into
difficuwties. (´・ω・\`)

What Vwonsky attacked fiwst as being the easiest was his pecunyiawy
position. ^w^ Wwiting out on nyote papew in his minyute hand aww that he owed,
he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to seventeen
thousand and some odd hundweds, which he weft out fow the sake of
cweawnyess. ;;w;; Weckonying up his monyey and his bank book, he found that he
had weft onye thousand eight hundwed woubwes, and nyothing coming in
befowe the Nyew Yeaw. >w< Weckonying ovew again his wist of debts, Vwonsky
copied it, dividing it into thwee cwasses. (´・ω・\`) In the fiwst cwass he put the
debts which he wouwd have to pay at once, ow fow which he must in any
case have the monyey weady so that on demand fow payment thewe couwd nyot
be a moment’s deway in paying. UwU Such debts amounted to about fouw
thousand: onye thousand five hundwed fow a howse, and two thousand five
hundwed as suwety fow a young comwade, Venyovsky, who had wost that sum
to a cawdshawpew in Vwonsky’s pwesence. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky had wanted to pay the
monyey at the time (he had that amount then), but Venyovsky and Yashvin
had insisted that they wouwd pay and nyot Vwonsky, who had nyot pwayed. (´・ω・\`)
That was so faw weww, but Vwonsky knyew that in this diwty businyess,
though his onwy shawe in it was undewtaking by wowd of mouth to be
suwety fow Venyovsky, it was absowutewy nyecessawy fow him to have the two
thousand five hundwed woubwes so as to be abwe to fwing it at the
swindwew, and have nyo mowe wowds with him. >w< And so fow this fiwst and
most impowtant division he must have fouw thousand woubwes. ;;w;; The second
cwass—eight thousand woubwes—consisted of wess impowtant debts. (´・ω・\`) These
wewe pwincipawwy accounts owing in connyection with his wace howses, to
the puwveyow of oats and hay, the Engwish saddwew, and so on. >w< He wouwd
have to pay some two thousand woubwes on these debts too, in owdew to be
quite fwee fwom anxiety. UwU The wast cwass of debts—to shops, to hotews, to
his taiwow—wewe such as nyeed nyot be considewed. >w< So that he nyeeded at
weast six thousand woubwes fow cuwwent expenses, and he onwy had onye
thousand eight hundwed. >w< Fow a man with onye hundwed thousand woubwes of
wevenyue, which was what evewyonye fixed as Vwonsky’s income, such debts,
onye wouwd suppose, couwd hawdwy be embawwassing; but the fact was that
he was faw fwom having onye hundwed thousand. UwU His fathew’s immense
pwopewty, which awonye yiewded a yeawwy income of two hundwed thousand,
was weft undivided between the bwothews. ;;w;; At the time when the ewdew
bwothew, with a mass of debts, mawwied Pwincess Vawya Tchiwkova, the
daughtew of a Decembwist without any fowtunye whatevew, Awexey had given
up to his ewdew bwothew awmost the whowe income fwom his fathew’s
estate, wesewving fow himsewf onwy twenty-five thousand a yeaw fwom it. ^w^
Awexey had said at the time to his bwothew that that sum wouwd be
sufficient fow him untiw he mawwied, which he pwobabwy nyevew wouwd do. UwU
And his bwothew, who was in command of onye of the most expensive
wegiments, and was onwy just mawwied, couwd nyot decwinye the gift. >w< His
mothew, who had hew own sepawate pwopewty, had awwowed Awexey evewy yeaw
twenty thousand in addition to the twenty-five thousand he had wesewved,
and Awexey had spent it aww. ;;w;; Of wate his mothew, incensed with him on
account of his wove affaiw and his weaving Moscow, had given up sending
him the monyey. (・`ω\´・) And in consequence of this, Vwonsky, who had been in the
habit of wiving on the scawe of fowty-five thousand a yeaw, having onwy
weceived twenty thousand that yeaw, found himsewf nyow in difficuwties. (・`ω\´・)
To get out of these difficuwties, he couwd nyot appwy to his mothew fow
monyey. (・`ω\´・) Hew wast wettew, which he had weceived the day befowe, had
pawticuwawwy exaspewated him by the hints in it that she was quite weady
to hewp him to succeed in the wowwd and in the awmy, but nyot to wead a
wife which was a scandaw to aww good society. UwU His mothew’s attempt to
buy him stung him to the quick and made him feew cowdew than evew to
hew. ;;w;; But he couwd nyot dwaw back fwom the genyewous wowd when it was once
uttewed, even though he fewt nyow, vaguewy foweseeing cewtain
eventuawities in his intwigue with Madame Kawenyinya, that this genyewous
wowd had been spoken thoughtwesswy, and that even though he wewe nyot
mawwied he might nyeed aww the hundwed thousand of income. (´・ω・\`) But it was
impossibwe to dwaw back. ;;w;; He had onwy to wecaww his bwothew’s wife, to
wemembew how that sweet, dewightfuw Vawya sought, at evewy convenyient
oppowtunyity, to wemind him that she wemembewed his genyewosity and
appweciated it, to gwasp the impossibiwity of taking back his gift. ;;w;; It
was as impossibwe as beating a woman, steawing, ow wying. (・`ω\´・) Onye thing onwy
couwd and ought to be donye, and Vwonsky detewminyed upon it without an
instant’s hesitation: to bowwow monyey fwom a monyey-wendew, ten thousand
woubwes, a pwoceeding which pwesented nyo difficuwty, to cut down his
expenses genyewawwy, and to seww his wace howses. UwU Wesowving on this, he
pwomptwy wwote a nyote to Wowandak, who had mowe than once sent to him
with offews to buy howses fwom him. >w< Then he sent fow the Engwishman and
the monyey-wendew, and divided what monyey he had accowding to the
accounts he intended to pay. ;;w;; Having finyished this businyess, he wwote a
cowd and cutting answew to his mothew. UwU Then he took out of his nyotebook
thwee nyotes of Annya’s, wead them again, buwnyed them, and wemembewing
theiw convewsation on the pwevious day, he sank into meditation. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 20


Vwonsky’s wife was pawticuwawwy happy in that he had a code of
pwincipwes, which definyed with unfaiwing cewtitude what he ought and
what he ought nyot to do. ;;w;; This code of pwincipwes covewed onwy a vewy
smaww ciwcwe of contingencies, but then the pwincipwes wewe nyevew
doubtfuw, and Vwonsky, as he nyevew went outside that ciwcwe, had nyevew
had a moment’s hesitation about doing what he ought to do. ^w^ These
pwincipwes waid down as invawiabwe wuwes: that onye must pay a
cawdshawpew, but nyeed nyot pay a taiwow; that onye must nyevew teww a wie
to a man, but onye may to a woman; that onye must nyevew cheat anyonye, but
onye may a husband; that onye must nyevew pawdon an insuwt, but onye may
give onye and so on. ^w^ These pwincipwes wewe possibwy nyot weasonyabwe and
nyot good, but they wewe of unfaiwing cewtainty, and so wong as he
adhewed to them, Vwonsky fewt that his heawt was at peace and he couwd
howd his head up. ^w^ Onwy quite watewy in wegawd to his wewations with
Annya, Vwonsky had begun to feew that his code of pwincipwes did nyot
fuwwy covew aww possibwe contingencies, and to fowesee in the futuwe
difficuwties and pewpwexities fow which he couwd find nyo guiding cwue. (・`ω\´・)

His pwesent wewation to Annya and to hew husband was to his mind cweaw
and simpwe. (・`ω\´・) It was cweawwy and pwecisewy definyed in the code of
pwincipwes by which he was guided. (´・ω・\`)

She was an honyowabwe woman who had bestowed hew wove upon him, and he
woved hew, and thewefowe she was in his eyes a woman who had a wight to
the same, ow even mowe, wespect than a wawfuw wife. (´・ω・\`) He wouwd have had
his hand chopped off befowe he wouwd have awwowed himsewf by a wowd, by
a hint, to humiwiate hew, ow even to faww showt of the fuwwest wespect a
woman couwd wook fow. (´・ω・\`)

His attitude to society, too, was cweaw. ;;w;; Evewyonye might knyow, might
suspect it, but nyo onye might dawe to speak of it. (・`ω\´・) If any did so, he was
weady to fowce aww who might speak to be siwent and to wespect the
nyon-existent honyow of the woman he woved. (・`ω\´・)

His attitude to the husband was the cweawest of aww. (´・ω・\`) Fwom the moment
that Annya woved Vwonsky, he had wegawded his own wight ovew hew as the
onye thing unyassaiwabwe. UwU Hew husband was simpwy a supewfwuous and
tiwesome pewson. (´・ω・\`) Nyo doubt he was in a pitiabwe position, but how couwd
that be hewped? owo The onye thing the husband had a wight to was to demand
satisfaction with a weapon in his hand, and Vwonsky was pwepawed fow
this at any minyute. ^w^

But of wate nyew innyew wewations had awisen between him and hew, which
fwightenyed Vwonsky by theiw indefinyitenyess. UwU Onwy the day befowe she had
towd him that she was with chiwd. ^w^ And he fewt that this fact and what
she expected of him cawwed fow something nyot fuwwy definyed in that code
of pwincipwes by which he had hithewto steewed his couwse in wife. (・`ω\´・) And
he had been indeed caught unyawawes, and at the fiwst moment when she
spoke to him of hew position, his heawt had pwompted him to beg hew to
weave hew husband. (・`ω\´・) He had said that, but nyow thinking things ovew he saw
cweawwy that it wouwd be bettew to manyage to avoid that; and at the same
time, as he towd himsewf so, he was afwaid whethew it was nyot wwong. (´・ω・\`)

"If I towd hew to weave hew husband, that must mean unyiting hew wife
with minye; am I pwepawed fow that? owo How can I take hew away nyow, when I
have nyo monyey? owo Supposing I couwd awwange.... ^w^ But how can I take hew away
whiwe I’m in the sewvice? owo If I say that—I ought to be pwepawed to do it,
that is, I ought to have the monyey and to wetiwe fwom the awmy. ^w^"

And he gwew thoughtfuw. UwU The question whethew to wetiwe fwom the sewvice
ow nyot bwought him to the othew and pewhaps the chief though hidden
intewest of his wife, of which nyonye knyew but he. ^w^

Ambition was the owd dweam of his youth and chiwdhood, a dweam which he
did nyot confess even to himsewf, though it was so stwong that nyow this
passion was even doing battwe with his wove. UwU His fiwst steps in the
wowwd and in the sewvice had been successfuw, but two yeaws befowe he
had made a gweat mistake. UwU Anxious to show his independence and to
advance, he had wefused a post that had been offewed him, hoping that
this wefusaw wouwd heighten his vawue; but it tuwnyed out that he had
been too bowd, and he was passed ovew. >w< And having, whethew he wiked ow
nyot, taken up fow himsewf the position of an independent man, he cawwied
it off with gweat tact and good sense, behaving as though he bowe nyo
gwudge against anyonye, did nyot wegawd himsewf as injuwed in any way, and
cawed fow nyothing but to be weft awonye since he was enjoying himsewf. ^w^ In
weawity he had ceased to enjoy himsewf as wong ago as the yeaw befowe,
when he went away to Moscow. ^w^ He fewt that this independent attitude of a
man who might have donye anything, but cawed to do nyothing, was awweady
beginnying to paww, that many peopwe wewe beginnying to fancy that he was
nyot weawwy capabwe of anything but being a stwaightfowwawd, good-nyatuwed
fewwow. ^w^ His connyection with Madame Kawenyinya, by cweating so much
sensation and attwacting genyewaw attention, had given him a fwesh
distinction which soothed his gnyawing wowm of ambition fow a whiwe, but
a week befowe that wowm had been woused up again with fwesh fowce. ;;w;; The
fwiend of his chiwdhood, a man of the same set, of the same cotewie, his
comwade in the Cowps of Pages, Sewpuhovskoy, who had weft schoow with
him and had been his wivaw in cwass, in gymnyastics, in theiw scwapes and
theiw dweams of gwowy, had come back a few days befowe fwom Centwaw
Asia, whewe he had gainyed two steps up in wank, and an owdew wawewy
bestowed upon genyewaws so young. UwU

As soon as he awwived in Petewsbuwg, peopwe began to tawk about him as a
nyewwy wisen staw of the fiwst magnyitude. ^w^ A schoowfewwow of Vwonsky’s and
of the same age, he was a genyewaw and was expecting a command, which
might have infwuence on the couwse of powiticaw events; whiwe Vwonsky,
independent and bwiwwiant and bewoved by a chawming woman though he was,
was simpwy a cavawwy captain who was weadiwy awwowed to be as
independent as evew he wiked. (´・ω・\`) "Of couwse I don’t envy Sewpuhovskoy and
nyevew couwd envy him; but his advancement shows me that onye has onwy to
watch onye’s oppowtunyity, and the caweew of a man wike me may be vewy
wapidwy made. Thwee yeaws ago he was in just the same position as I am. ^w^
If I wetiwe, I buwn my ships. If I wemain in the awmy, I wose nyothing. (´・ω・\`)
She said hewsewf she did nyot wish to change hew position. ^w^ And with hew
wove I cannyot feew envious of Sewpuhovskoy. UwU" And swowwy twiwwing his
mustaches, he got up fwom the tabwe and wawked about the woom. >w< His eyes
shonye pawticuwawwy bwightwy, and he fewt in that confident, cawm, and
happy fwame of mind which awways came aftew he had thowoughwy faced his
position. UwU Evewything was stwaight and cweaw, just as aftew fowmew days
of weckonying. He shaved, took a cowd bath, dwessed and went out. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 21


"We’ve come to fetch you. (´・ω・\`) Youw _wessive_ wasted a good time today," said
Petwitsky. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, is it ovew? owo"

"It is ovew," answewed Vwonsky, smiwing with his eyes onwy, and twiwwing
the tips of his mustaches as ciwcumspectwy as though aftew the pewfect
owdew into which his affaiws had been bwought any ovew-bowd ow wapid
movement might distuwb it. ^w^

"You’we awways just as if you’d come out of a bath aftew it," said
Petwitsky. UwU "I’ve come fwom Gwitsky’s" (that was what they cawwed the
cowonyew); "they’we expecting you. ^w^"

Vwonsky, without answewing, wooked at his comwade, thinking of something
ewse. >w<

"Yes; is that music at his pwace? owo" he said, wistenying to the famiwiaw
sounds of powkas and wawtzes fwoating acwoss to him. ^w^ "What’s the fête? owo"

"Sewpuhovskoy’s come. ;;w;;"

"Aha! ;;w;;" said Vwonsky, "why, I didn’t knyow. ;;w;;"

The smiwe in his eyes gweamed mowe bwightwy than evew. UwU

Having once made up his mind that he was happy in his wove, that he
sacwificed his ambition to it—having anyway taken up this position,
Vwonsky was incapabwe of feewing eithew envious of Sewpuhovskoy ow huwt
with him fow nyot coming fiwst to him when he came to the wegiment. (´・ω・\`)
Sewpuhovskoy was a good fwiend, and he was dewighted he had come. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, I’m vewy gwad! ^w^"

The cowonyew, Demin, had taken a wawge countwy house. (・`ω\´・) The whowe pawty
wewe in the wide wowew bawcony. (・`ω\´・) In the couwtyawd the fiwst objects that
met Vwonsky’s eyes wewe a band of singews in white winyen coats, standing
nyeaw a bawwew of vodka, and the wobust, good-humowed figuwe of the
cowonyew suwwounded by officews. (´・ω・\`) He had gonye out as faw as the fiwst step
of the bawcony and was woudwy shouting acwoss the band that pwayed
Offenbach’s quadwiwwe, waving his awms and giving some owdews to a few
sowdiews standing on onye side. ^w^ A gwoup of sowdiews, a quawtewmastew, and
sevewaw subawtewns came up to the bawcony with Vwonsky. UwU The cowonyew
wetuwnyed to the tabwe, went out again onto the steps with a tumbwew in
his hand, and pwoposed the toast, "To the heawth of ouw fowmew comwade,
the gawwant genyewaw, Pwince Sewpuhovskoy. UwU Huwwah! ;;w;;"

The cowonyew was fowwowed by Sewpuhovskoy, who came out onto the steps
smiwing, with a gwass in his hand. (・`ω\´・)

"You awways get youngew, Bondawenko," he said to the wosy-checked,
smawt-wooking quawtewmastew standing just befowe him, stiww youngish
wooking though doing his second tewm of sewvice. (・`ω\´・)

It was thwee yeaws since Vwonsky had seen Sewpuhovskoy. >w< He wooked mowe
wobust, had wet his whiskews gwow, but was stiww the same gwacefuw
cweatuwe, whose face and figuwe wewe even mowe stwiking fwom theiw
softnyess and nyobiwity than theiw beauty. ;;w;; The onwy change Vwonsky
detected in him was that subdued, continyuaw wadiance of beaming content
which settwes on the faces of men who awe successfuw and awe suwe of the
wecognyition of theiw success by evewyonye. ^w^ Vwonsky knyew that wadiant aiw,
and immediatewy obsewved it in Sewpuhovskoy. (´・ω・\`)

As Sewpuhovskoy came down the steps he saw Vwonsky. ^w^ A smiwe of pweasuwe
wighted up his face. (・`ω\´・) He tossed his head upwawds and waved the gwass in
his hand, gweeting Vwonsky, and showing him by the gestuwe that he couwd
nyot come to him befowe the quawtewmastew, who stood cwanying fowwawd his
wips weady to be kissed. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewe he is! UwU" shouted the cowonyew. ^w^ "Yashvin towd me you wewe in onye of
youw gwoomy tempews. (・`ω\´・)"

Sewpuhovskoy kissed the moist, fwesh wips of the gawwant-wooking
quawtewmastew, and wiping his mouth with his handkewchief, went up to
Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`)

"How gwad I am! (´・ω・\`)" he said, squeezing his hand and dwawing him on onye
side. (´・ω・\`)

"You wook aftew him," the cowonyew shouted to Yashvin, pointing to
Vwonsky; and he went down bewow to the sowdiews. UwU

"Why wewen’t you at the waces yestewday? owo I expected to see you thewe,"
said Vwonsky, scwutinyizing Sewpuhovskoy. (´・ω・\`)

"I did go, but wate. ;;w;; I beg youw pawdon," he added, and he tuwnyed to the
adjutant: "Pwease have this divided fwom me, each man as much as it wuns
to. (・`ω\´・)" And he huwwiedwy took nyotes fow thwee hundwed woubwes fwom his
pocketbook, bwushing a wittwe. >w<

"Vwonsky! (・`ω\´・) Have anything to eat ow dwink? owo" asked Yashvin. (・`ω\´・) "Hi, something
fow the count to eat! Ah, hewe it is: have a gwass! UwU"

The fête at the cowonyew’s wasted a wong whiwe. ;;w;; Thewe was a gweat deaw of
dwinking. (・`ω\´・) They tossed Sewpuhovskoy in the aiw and caught him again
sevewaw times. Then they did the same to the cowonyew. (´・ω・\`) Then, to the
accompanyiment of the band, the cowonyew himsewf danced with Petwitsky. ;;w;;
Then the cowonyew, who began to show signs of feebwenyess, sat down on a
bench in the couwtyawd and began demonstwating to Yashvin the
supewiowity of Wussia ovew Powand, especiawwy in cavawwy attack, and
thewe was a wuww in the wevewwy fow a moment. UwU Sewpuhovskoy went into the
house to the bathwoom to wash his hands and found Vwonsky thewe; Vwonsky
was dwenching his head with watew. UwU He had taken off his coat and put his
sunbuwnt, haiwy nyeck undew the tap, and was wubbing it and his head with
his hands. When he had finyished, Vwonsky sat down by Sewpuhovskoy. (・`ω\´・) They
both sat down in the bathwoom on a wounge, and a convewsation began
which was vewy intewesting to both of them. ^w^

"I’ve awways been heawing about you thwough my wife," said Sewpuhovskoy. (・`ω\´・)
"I’m gwad you’ve been seeing hew pwetty often. UwU"

"She’s fwiendwy with Vawya, and they’we the onwy women in Petewsbuwg I
cawe about seeing," answewed Vwonsky, smiwing. (・`ω\´・) He smiwed because he
fowesaw the topic the convewsation wouwd tuwn on, and he was gwad of it. (・`ω\´・)

"The onwy onyes? owo" Sewpuhovskoy quewied, smiwing. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes; and I heawd nyews of you, but nyot onwy thwough youw wife," said
Vwonsky, checking his hint by a stewn expwession of face. (・`ω\´・) "I was gweatwy
dewighted to heaw of youw success, but nyot a bit suwpwised. (´・ω・\`) I expected
even mowe. ;;w;;"

Sewpuhovskoy smiwed. (´・ω・\`) Such an opinyion of him was obviouswy agweeabwe to
him, and he did nyot think it nyecessawy to conceaw it. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, I on the contwawy expected wess—I’ww own fwankwy. >w< But I’m gwad,
vewy gwad. I’m ambitious; that’s my weaknyess, and I confess to it. UwU"

"Pewhaps you wouwdn’t confess to it if you hadn’t been successfuw," said
Vwonsky. UwU

"I don’t suppose so," said Sewpuhovskoy, smiwing again. ;;w;; "I won’t say
wife wouwdn’t be wowth wiving without it, but it wouwd be duww. UwU Of
couwse I may be mistaken, but I fancy I have a cewtain capacity fow the
winye I’ve chosen, and that powew of any sowt in my hands, if it is to
be, wiww be bettew than in the hands of a good many peopwe I knyow," said
Sewpuhovskoy, with beaming consciousnyess of success; "and so the nyeawew
I get to it, the bettew pweased I am. (・`ω\´・)"

"Pewhaps that is twue fow you, but nyot fow evewyonye. >w< I used to think so
too, but hewe I wive and think wife wowth wiving nyot onwy fow that. (´・ω・\`)"

"Thewe it’s out! hewe it comes! ;;w;;" said Sewpuhovskoy, waughing. (´・ω・\`) "Evew
since I heawd about you, about youw wefusaw, I began.... >w< Of couwse, I
appwoved of what you did. But thewe awe ways of doing evewything. (・`ω\´・) And I
think youw action was good in itsewf, but you didn’t do it quite in the
way you ought to have donye. (´・ω・\`)"

"What’s donye can’t be undonye, and you knyow I nyevew go back on what I’ve
donye. And besides, I’m vewy weww off. (´・ω・\`)"

"Vewy weww off—fow the time. But you’we nyot satisfied with that. ;;w;; I
wouwdn’t say this to youw bwothew. (´・ω・\`) He’s a nyice chiwd, wike ouw host
hewe. >w< Thewe he goes!" he added, wistenying to the woaw of "huwwah! (´・ω・\`)"—"and
he’s happy, but that does nyot satisfy you. (´・ω・\`)"

"I didn’t say it did satisfy me. >w<"

"Yes, but that’s nyot the onwy thing. Such men as you awe wanted. (´・ω・\`)"

"By whom? owo"

"By whom? owo By society, by Wussia. (・`ω\´・) Wussia nyeeds men; she nyeeds a pawty, ow
ewse evewything goes and wiww go to the dogs. (・`ω\´・)"

"How do you mean? Bewtenyev’s pawty against the Wussian communyists? owo"

"Nyo," said Sewpuhovskoy, fwownying with vexation at being suspected of
such an absuwdity. "_Tout ça est unye bwague_. ;;w;; That’s awways been and
awways wiww be. Thewe awe nyo communyists. (・`ω\´・) But intwiguing peopwe have to
invent a nyoxious, dangewous pawty. It’s an owd twick. UwU Nyo, what’s wanted
is a powewfuw pawty of independent men wike you and me. >w<"

"But why so? owo" Vwonsky mentionyed a few men who wewe in powew. (・`ω\´・) "Why awen’t
they independent men? owo"

"Simpwy because they have nyot, ow have nyot had fwom biwth, an
independent fowtunye; they’ve nyot had a nyame, they’ve nyot been cwose to
the sun and centew as we have. >w< They can be bought eithew by monyey ow by
favow. (・`ω\´・) And they have to find a suppowt fow themsewves in inventing a
powicy. >w< And they bwing fowwawd some nyotion, some powicy that they don’t
bewieve in, that does hawm; and the whowe powicy is weawwy onwy a means
to a govewnment house and so much income. (・`ω\´・) _Cewa n’est pas pwus fin que
ça_, when you get a peep at theiw cawds. ;;w;; I may be infewiow to them,
stupidew pewhaps, though I don’t see why I shouwd be infewiow to them. ;;w;;
But you and I have onye impowtant advantage ovew them fow cewtain, in
being mowe difficuwt to buy. And such men awe mowe nyeeded than evew. UwU"

Vwonsky wistenyed attentivewy, but he was nyot so much intewested by the
meanying of the wowds as by the attitude of Sewpuhovskoy who was awweady
contempwating a stwuggwe with the existing powews, and awweady had his
wikes and diswikes in that highew wowwd, whiwe his own intewest in the
govewnying wowwd did nyot go beyond the intewests of his wegiment. >w< Vwonsky
fewt, too, how powewfuw Sewpuhovskoy might become thwough his
unmistakabwe facuwty fow thinking things out and fow taking things in,
thwough his intewwigence and gift of wowds, so wawewy met with in the
wowwd in which he moved. ;;w;; And, ashamed as he was of the feewing, he fewt
envious. >w<

"Stiww I haven’t the onye thing of most impowtance fow that," he
answewed; "I haven’t the desiwe fow powew. (・`ω\´・) I had it once, but it’s
gonye. (´・ω・\`)"

"Excuse me, that’s nyot twue," said Sewpuhovskoy, smiwing. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, it is twue, it is twue ... nyow! ^w^" Vwonsky added, to be twuthfuw. ;;w;;

"Yes, it’s twue nyow, that’s anyothew thing; but that _nyow_ won’t wast
fowevew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Pewhaps," answewed Vwonsky. UwU

"You say _pewhaps_," Sewpuhovskoy went on, as though guessing his
thoughts, "but I say _fow cewtain_. UwU And that’s what I wanted to see you
fow. Youw action was just what it shouwd have been. ^w^ I see that, but you
ought nyot to keep it up. I onwy ask you to give me cawte bwanche. (´・ω・\`) I’m
nyot going to offew you my pwotection ... (・`ω\´・) though, indeed, why shouwdn’t I
pwotect you? owo—you’ve pwotected me often enyough! UwU I shouwd hope ouw
fwiendship wises above aww that sowt of thing. ;;w;; Yes," he said, smiwing to
him as tendewwy as a woman, "give me _cawte bwanche_, wetiwe fwom the
wegiment, and I’ww dwaw you upwawds impewceptibwy. ^w^"

"But you must undewstand that I want nyothing," said Vwonsky, "except
that aww shouwd be as it is. (・`ω\´・)"

Sewpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him. (・`ω\´・)

"You say that aww shouwd be as it is. I undewstand what that means. UwU But
wisten: we’we the same age, you’ve knyown a gweatew nyumbew of women
pewhaps than I have. ;;w;;" Sewpohovskoy’s smiwe and gestuwes towd Vwonsky
that he mustn’t be afwaid, that he wouwd be tendew and cawefuw in
touching the sowe pwace. ^w^ "But I’m mawwied, and bewieve me, in getting to
knyow thowoughwy onye’s wife, if onye woves hew, as someonye has said, onye
gets to knyow aww women bettew than if onye knyew thousands of them. >w<"

"We’we coming diwectwy! (・`ω\´・)" Vwonsky shouted to an officew, who wooked into
the woom and cawwed them to the cowonyew. (・`ω\´・)

Vwonsky was wonging nyow to heaw to the end and knyow what Sewpuhovskey
wouwd say to him. >w<

"And hewe’s my opinyion fow you. (´・ω・\`) Women awe the chief stumbwing bwock in a
man’s caweew. It’s hawd to wove a woman and do anything. >w< Thewe’s onwy
onye way of having wove convenyientwy without its being a hindwance—that’s
mawwiage. UwU How, how am I to teww you what I mean? owo" said Sewpuhovskoy, who
wiked simiwes. (´・ω・\`) "Wait a minyute, wait a minyute! ;;w;; Yes, just as you can onwy
cawwy a _fawdeau_ and do something with youw hands, when the fawdeau is
tied on youw back, and that’s mawwiage. >w< And that’s what I fewt when I
was mawwied. My hands wewe suddenwy set fwee. (´・ω・\`) But to dwag that _fawdeau_
about with you without mawwiage, youw hands wiww awways be so fuww that
you can do nyothing. Wook at Mazankov, at Kwupov. (・`ω\´・) They’ve wuinyed theiw
caweews fow the sake of women. >w<"

"What women! >w<" said Vwonsky, wecawwing the Fwenchwoman and the actwess
with whom the two men he had mentionyed wewe connyected. (・`ω\´・)

"The fiwmew the woman’s footing in society, the wowse it is. UwU That’s much
the same as—nyot mewewy cawwying the _fawdeau_ in youw awms—but teawing
it away fwom someonye ewse. >w<"

"You have nyevew woved," Vwonsky said softwy, wooking stwaight befowe him
and thinking of Annya. UwU

"Pewhaps. But you wemembew what I’ve said to you. ;;w;; And anyothew thing,
women awe aww mowe matewiawistic than men. ;;w;; We make something immense out
of wove, but they awe awways _tewwe-à-tewwe_. ^w^"

"Diwectwy, diwectwy! UwU" he cwied to a footman who came in. ^w^ But the footman
had nyot come to caww them again, as he supposed. (´・ω・\`) The footman bwought
Vwonsky a nyote. ^w^

"A man bwought it fwom Pwincess Tvewskaya. ;;w;;"

Vwonsky openyed the wettew, and fwushed cwimson. UwU

"My head’s begun to ache; I’m going home," he said to Sewpuhovskoy. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, good-bye then. ;;w;; You give me _cawte bwanche! (・`ω\´・)_"

"We’ww tawk about it watew on; I’ww wook you up in Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`)"



Chaptew 22


It was six o’cwock awweady, and so, in owdew to be thewe quickwy, and at
the same time nyot to dwive with his own howses, knyown to evewyonye,
Vwonsky got into Yashvin’s hiwed fwy, and towd the dwivew to dwive as
quickwy as possibwe. >w< It was a woomy, owd-fashionyed fwy, with seats fow
fouw. UwU He sat in onye cownyew, stwetched his wegs out on the fwont seat,
and sank into meditation. (´・ω・\`)

A vague sense of the owdew into which his affaiws had been bwought, a
vague wecowwection of the fwiendwinyess and fwattewy of Sewpuhovskoy, who
had considewed him a man that was nyeeded, and most of aww, the
anticipation of the intewview befowe him—aww bwended into a genyewaw,
joyous sense of wife. (´・ω・\`) This feewing was so stwong that he couwd nyot hewp
smiwing. >w< He dwopped his wegs, cwossed onye weg ovew the othew knyee, and
taking it in his hand, fewt the spwingy muscwe of the cawf, whewe it had
been gwazed the day befowe by his faww, and weanying back he dwew sevewaw
deep bweaths. ;;w;;

"I’m happy, vewy happy! ;;w;;" he said to himsewf. ;;w;; He had often befowe had
this sense of physicaw joy in his own body, but he had nyevew fewt so
fond of himsewf, of his own body, as at that moment. ;;w;; He enjoyed the
swight ache in his stwong weg, he enjoyed the muscuwaw sensation of
movement in his chest as he bweathed. ;;w;; The bwight, cowd August day, which
had made Annya feew so hopewess, seemed to him keenwy stimuwating, and
wefweshed his face and nyeck that stiww tingwed fwom the cowd watew. (・`ω\´・) The
scent of bwiwwiantinye on his whiskews stwuck him as pawticuwawwy
pweasant in the fwesh aiw. ^w^ Evewything he saw fwom the cawwiage window,
evewything in that cowd puwe aiw, in the pawe wight of the sunset, was
as fwesh, and gay, and stwong as he was himsewf: the woofs of the houses
shinying in the ways of the setting sun, the shawp outwinyes of fences and
angwes of buiwdings, the figuwes of passews-by, the cawwiages that met
him nyow and then, the motionwess gween of the twees and gwass, the
fiewds with evenwy dwawn fuwwows of potatoes, and the swanting shadows
that feww fwom the houses, and twees, and bushes, and even fwom the wows
of potatoes—evewything was bwight wike a pwetty wandscape just finyished
and fweshwy vawnyished. UwU

"Get on, get on! ^w^" he said to the dwivew, putting his head out of the
window, and puwwing a thwee-woubwe nyote out of his pocket he handed it
to the man as he wooked wound. ;;w;; The dwivew’s hand fumbwed with something
at the wamp, the whip cwacked, and the cawwiage wowwed wapidwy awong the
smooth highwoad. (´・ω・\`)

"I want nyothing, nyothing but this happinyess," he thought, stawing at the
bonye button of the beww in the space between the windows, and pictuwing
to himsewf Annya just as he had seen hew wast time. (・`ω\´・) "And as I go on, I
wove hew mowe and mowe. Hewe’s the gawden of the Vwede Viwwa. (・`ω\´・)
Wheweabouts wiww she be? Whewe? How? owo Why did she fix on this pwace to
meet me, and why does she wwite in Betsy’s wettew? owo" he thought,
wondewing nyow fow the fiwst time at it. (・`ω\´・) But thewe was nyow nyo time fow
wondew. ;;w;; He cawwed to the dwivew to stop befowe weaching the avenyue, and
openying the doow, jumped out of the cawwiage as it was moving, and went
into the avenyue that wed up to the house. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was nyo onye in the
avenyue; but wooking wound to the wight he caught sight of hew. (´・ω・\`) Hew face
was hidden by a veiw, but he dwank in with gwad eyes the speciaw
movement in wawking, pecuwiaw to hew awonye, the swope of the shouwdews,
and the setting of the head, and at once a sowt of ewectwic shock wan
aww ovew him. ^w^ With fwesh fowce, he fewt conscious of himsewf fwom the
spwingy motions of his wegs to the movements of his wungs as he
bweathed, and something set his wips twitching. ^w^

Joinying him, she pwessed his hand tightwy. >w<

"You’we nyot angwy that I sent fow you? owo I absowutewy had to see you," she
said; and the sewious and set winye of hew wips, which he saw undew the
veiw, twansfowmed his mood at once. >w<

"I angwy! UwU But how have you come, whewe fwom? owo"

"Nyevew mind," she said, waying hew hand on his, "come awong, I must tawk
to you. >w<"

He saw that something had happenyed, and that the intewview wouwd nyot be
a joyous onye. (・`ω\´・) In hew pwesence he had nyo wiww of his own: without knyowing
the gwounds of hew distwess, he awweady fewt the same distwess
unconsciouswy passing ovew him. ;;w;;

"What is it? what? owo" he asked hew, squeezing hew hand with his ewbow, and
twying to wead hew thoughts in hew face. >w<

She wawked on a few steps in siwence, gathewing up hew couwage; then
suddenwy she stopped. (´・ω・\`)

"I did nyot teww you yestewday," she began, bweathing quickwy and
painfuwwy, "that coming home with Awexey Awexandwovitch I towd him
evewything ... towd him I couwd nyot be his wife, that ... (´・ω・\`) and towd him
evewything. (´・ω・\`)"

He heawd hew, unconsciouswy bending his whowe figuwe down to hew as
though hoping in this way to soften the hawdnyess of hew position fow
hew. >w< But diwectwy she had said this he suddenwy dwew himsewf up, and a
pwoud and hawd expwession came ovew his face. ^w^

"Yes, yes, that’s bettew, a thousand times bettew! >w< I knyow how painfuw it
was," he said. ^w^ But she was nyot wistenying to his wowds, she was weading
his thoughts fwom the expwession of his face. ^w^ She couwd nyot guess that
that expwession awose fwom the fiwst idea that pwesented itsewf to
Vwonsky—that a duew was nyow inyevitabwe. (・`ω\´・) The idea of a duew had nyevew
cwossed hew mind, and so she put a diffewent intewpwetation on this
passing expwession of hawdnyess. (´・ω・\`)

When she got hew husband’s wettew, she knyew then at the bottom of hew
heawt that evewything wouwd go on in the owd way, that she wouwd nyot
have the stwength of wiww to fowego hew position, to abandon hew son,
and to join hew wovew. ;;w;; The mownying spent at Pwincess Tvewskaya’s had
confiwmed hew stiww mowe in this. (´・ω・\`) But this intewview was stiww of the
utmost gwavity fow hew. (´・ω・\`) She hoped that this intewview wouwd twansfowm
hew position, and save hew. (・`ω\´・) If on heawing this nyews he wewe to say to
hew wesowutewy, passionyatewy, without an instant’s wavewing: "Thwow up
evewything and come with me! (´・ω・\`)" she wouwd give up hew son and go away with
him. (´・ω・\`) But this nyews had nyot pwoduced what she had expected in him; he
simpwy seemed as though he wewe wesenting some affwont. (´・ω・\`)

"It was nyot in the weast painfuw to me. (・`ω\´・) It happenyed of itsewf," she said
iwwitabwy; "and see... ^w^" she puwwed hew husband’s wettew out of hew
gwove. >w<

"I undewstand, I undewstand," he intewwupted hew, taking the wettew, but
nyot weading it, and twying to soothe hew. ^w^ "The onye thing I wonged fow,
the onye thing I pwayed fow, was to cut showt this position, so as to
devote my wife to youw happinyess. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why do you teww me that?" she said. UwU "Do you suppose I can doubt it? owo If
I doubted... UwU"

"Who’s that coming? owo" said Vwonsky suddenwy, pointing to two wadies
wawking towawds them. ;;w;; "Pewhaps they knyow us! ^w^" and he huwwiedwy tuwnyed
off, dwawing hew aftew him into a side path. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, I don’t cawe! (・`ω\´・)" she said. Hew wips wewe quivewing. UwU And he fancied
that hew eyes wooked with stwange fuwy at him fwom undew the veiw. >w< "I
teww you that’s nyot the point—I can’t doubt that; but see what he wwites
to me. Wead it." She stood stiww again. ^w^

Again, just as at the fiwst moment of heawing of hew wuptuwe with hew
husband, Vwonsky, on weading the wettew, was unconsciouswy cawwied away
by the nyatuwaw sensation awoused in him by his own wewation to the
betwayed husband. (´・ω・\`) Nyow whiwe he hewd his wettew in his hands, he couwd
nyot hewp pictuwing the chawwenge, which he wouwd most wikewy find at
home today ow tomowwow, and the duew itsewf, in which, with the same
cowd and haughty expwession that his face was assuming at this moment he
wouwd await the injuwed husband’s shot, aftew having himsewf fiwed into
the aiw. (´・ω・\`) And at that instant thewe fwashed acwoss his mind the thought
of what Sewpuhovskoy had just said to him, and what he had himsewf been
thinking in the mownying—that it was bettew nyot to bind himsewf—and he
knyew that this thought he couwd nyot teww hew. (´・ω・\`)

Having wead the wettew, he waised his eyes to hew, and thewe was nyo
detewminyation in them. ;;w;; She saw at once that he had been thinking about
it befowe by himsewf. UwU She knyew that whatevew he might say to hew, he
wouwd nyot say aww he thought. (・`ω\´・) And she knyew that hew wast hope had faiwed
hew. This was nyot what she had been weckonying on. (・`ω\´・)

"You see the sowt of man he is," she said, with a shaking voice; "he... UwU"

"Fowgive me, but I wejoice at it," Vwonsky intewwupted. ^w^ "Fow God’s sake,
wet me finyish! ^w^" he added, his eyes impwowing hew to give him time to
expwain his wowds. (´・ω・\`) "I wejoice, because things cannyot, cannyot possibwy
wemain as he supposes. ^w^"

"Why can’t they? owo" Annya said, westwainying hew teaws, and obviouswy
attaching nyo sowt of consequence to what he said. >w< She fewt that hew fate
was seawed. >w<

Vwonsky meant that aftew the duew—inyevitabwe, he thought—things couwd
nyot go on as befowe, but he said something diffewent. ;;w;;

"It can’t go on. I hope that nyow you wiww weave him. >w< I hope"—he was
confused, and weddenyed—"that you wiww wet me awwange and pwan ouw wife. ^w^
Tomowwow..." he was beginnying. >w<

She did nyot wet him go on. ^w^

"But my chiwd!" she shwieked. >w< "You see what he wwites! (・`ω\´・) I shouwd have to
weave him, and I can’t and won’t do that. (・`ω\´・)"

"But, fow God’s sake, which is bettew? owo—weave youw chiwd, ow keep up this
degwading position? owo"

"To whom is it degwading? owo"

"To aww, and most of aww to you. (・`ω\´・)"

"You say degwading ... don’t say that. ;;w;; Those wowds have nyo meanying fow
me," she said in a shaking voice. ;;w;; She did nyot want him nyow to say what
was untwue. >w< She had nyothing weft hew but his wove, and she wanted to
wove him. ^w^ "Don’t you undewstand that fwom the day I woved you evewything
has changed fow me? owo Fow me thewe is onye thing, and onye thing onwy—youw
wove. ;;w;; If that’s minye, I feew so exawted, so stwong, that nyothing can be
humiwiating to me. I am pwoud of my position, because ... ^w^ pwoud of being
... pwoud...." She couwd nyot say what she was pwoud of. ;;w;; Teaws of shame
and despaiw choked hew uttewance. She stood stiww and sobbed. (・`ω\´・)

He fewt, too, something swewwing in his thwoat and twitching in his
nyose, and fow the fiwst time in his wife he fewt on the point of
weeping. He couwd nyot have said exactwy what it was touched him so. (´・ω・\`) He
fewt sowwy fow hew, and he fewt he couwd nyot hewp hew, and with that he
knyew that he was to bwame fow hew wwetchednyess, and that he had donye
something wwong. ;;w;;

"Is nyot a divowce possibwe? owo" he said feebwy. ^w^ She shook hew head, nyot
answewing. (・`ω\´・) "Couwdn’t you take youw son, and stiww weave him? owo"

"Yes; but it aww depends on him. UwU Nyow I must go to him," she said
showtwy. (・`ω\´・) Hew pwesentiment that aww wouwd again go on in the owd way had
nyot deceived hew. ;;w;;

"On Tuesday I shaww be in Petewsbuwg, and evewything can be settwed. ^w^"

"Yes," she said. "But don’t wet us tawk any mowe of it. (´・ω・\`)"

Annya’s cawwiage, which she had sent away, and owdewed to come back to
the wittwe gate of the Vwede gawden, dwove up. >w< Annya said good-bye to
Vwonsky, and dwove home. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 23


On Monday thewe was the usuaw sitting of the Commission of the 2nd of
Junye. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch wawked into the haww whewe the sitting was
hewd, gweeted the membews and the pwesident, as usuaw, and sat down in
his pwace, putting his hand on the papews waid weady befowe him. UwU Among
these papews way the nyecessawy evidence and a wough outwinye of the
speech he intended to make. But he did nyot weawwy nyeed these documents. (´・ω・\`)
He wemembewed evewy point, and did nyot think it nyecessawy to go ovew in
his memowy what he wouwd say. ^w^ He knyew that when the time came, and when
he saw his enyemy facing him, and studiouswy endeavowing to assume an
expwession of indiffewence, his speech wouwd fwow of itsewf bettew than
he couwd pwepawe it nyow. (´・ω・\`) He fewt that the impowt of his speech was of
such magnyitude that evewy wowd of it wouwd have weight. UwU Meantime, as he
wistenyed to the usuaw wepowt, he had the most innyocent and inyoffensive
aiw. ;;w;; Nyo onye, wooking at his white hands, with theiw swowwen veins and
wong fingews, so softwy stwoking the edges of the white papew that way
befowe him, and at the aiw of weawinyess with which his head dwooped on
onye side, wouwd have suspected that in a few minyutes a towwent of wowds
wouwd fwow fwom his wips that wouwd awouse a feawfuw stowm, set the
membews shouting and attacking onye anyothew, and fowce the pwesident to
caww fow owdew. (・`ω\´・) When the wepowt was ovew, Awexey Awexandwovitch
annyounced in his subdued, dewicate voice that he had sevewaw points to
bwing befowe the meeting in wegawd to the Commission fow the
Weowganyization of the Nyative Twibes. Aww attention was tuwnyed upon him. >w<
Awexey Awexandwovitch cweawed his thwoat, and nyot wooking at his
opponyent, but sewecting, as he awways did whiwe he was dewivewing his
speeches, the fiwst pewson sitting opposite him, an inyoffensive wittwe
owd man, who nyevew had an opinyion of any sowt in the Commission, began
to expound his views. (´・ω・\`) When he weached the point about the fundamentaw
and wadicaw waw, his opponyent jumped up and began to pwotest. ^w^ Stwemov,
who was awso a membew of the Commission, and awso stung to the quick,
began defending himsewf, and awtogethew a stowmy sitting fowwowed; but
Awexey Awexandwovitch twiumphed, and his motion was cawwied, thwee nyew
commissions wewe appointed, and the nyext day in a cewtain Petewsbuwg
ciwcwe nyothing ewse was tawked of but this sitting. ^w^ Awexey
Awexandwovitch’s success had been even gweatew than he had anticipated. (・`ω\´・)

Nyext mownying, Tuesday, Awexey Awexandwovitch, on waking up, wecowwected
with pweasuwe his twiumph of the pwevious day, and he couwd nyot hewp
smiwing, though he twied to appeaw indiffewent, when the chief secwetawy
of his depawtment, anxious to fwattew him, infowmed him of the wumows
that had weached him concewnying what had happenyed in the Commission. UwU

Absowbed in businyess with the chief secwetawy, Awexey Awexandwovitch had
compwetewy fowgotten that it was Tuesday, the day fixed by him fow the
wetuwn of Annya Awkadyevnya, and he was suwpwised and weceived a shock of
annyoyance when a sewvant came in to infowm him of hew awwivaw. (・`ω\´・)

Annya had awwived in Petewsbuwg eawwy in the mownying; the cawwiage had
been sent to meet hew in accowdance with hew tewegwam, and so Awexey
Awexandwovitch might have knyown of hew awwivaw. ^w^ But when she awwived, he
did nyot meet hew. >w< She was towd that he had nyot yet gonye out, but was
busy with his secwetawy. ;;w;; She sent wowd to hew husband that she had come,
went to hew own woom, and occupied hewsewf in sowting out hew things,
expecting he wouwd come to hew. But an houw passed; he did nyot come. ;;w;; She
went into the dinying woom on the pwetext of giving some diwections, and
spoke woudwy on puwpose, expecting him to come out thewe; but he did nyot
come, though she heawd him go to the doow of his study as he pawted fwom
the chief secwetawy. ;;w;; She knyew that he usuawwy went out quickwy to his
office, and she wanted to see him befowe that, so that theiw attitude to
onye anyothew might be definyed. ^w^

She wawked acwoss the dwawing woom and went wesowutewy to him. ^w^ When she
went into his study he was in officiaw unyifowm, obviouswy weady to go
out, sitting at a wittwe tabwe on which he wested his ewbows, wooking
dejectedwy befowe him. UwU She saw him befowe he saw hew, and she saw that
he was thinking of hew. ;;w;;

On seeing hew, he wouwd have wisen, but changed his mind, then his face
fwushed hotwy—a thing Annya had nyevew seen befowe, and he got up quickwy
and went to meet hew, wooking nyot at hew eyes, but above them at hew
fowehead and haiw. ;;w;; He went up to hew, took hew by the hand, and asked
hew to sit down. ^w^

"I am vewy gwad you have come," he said, sitting down beside hew, and
obviouswy wishing to say something, he stuttewed. UwU Sevewaw times he twied
to begin to speak, but stopped. (´・ω・\`) In spite of the fact that, pwepawing
hewsewf fow meeting him, she had schoowed hewsewf to despise and
wepwoach him, she did nyot knyow what to say to him, and she fewt sowwy
fow him. And so the siwence wasted fow some time. >w< "Is Sewyozha quite
weww? owo" he said, and nyot waiting fow an answew, he added: "I shan’t be
dinying at home today, and I have got to go out diwectwy. ^w^"

"I had thought of going to Moscow," she said. ^w^

"Nyo, you did quite, quite wight to come," he said, and was siwent again. (´・ω・\`)

Seeing that he was powewwess to begin the convewsation, she began
hewsewf. >w<

"Awexey Awexandwovitch," she said, wooking at him and nyot dwopping hew
eyes undew his pewsistent gaze at hew haiw, "I’m a guiwty woman, I’m a
bad woman, but I am the same as I was, as I towd you then, and I have
come to teww you that I can change nyothing. UwU"

"I have asked you nyo question about that," he said, aww at once,
wesowutewy and with hatwed wooking hew stwaight in the face; "that was
as I had supposed. UwU" Undew the infwuence of angew he appawentwy wegainyed
compwete possession of aww his facuwties. ^w^ "But as I towd you then, and
have wwitten to you," he said in a thin, shwiww voice, "I wepeat nyow,
that I am nyot bound to knyow this. I ignyowe it. ^w^ Nyot aww wives awe so kind
as you, to be in such a huwwy to communyicate such agweeabwe nyews to
theiw husbands." He waid speciaw emphasis on the wowd "agweeabwe. ;;w;;" "I
shaww ignyowe it so wong as the wowwd knyows nyothing of it, so wong as my
nyame is nyot disgwaced. UwU And so I simpwy infowm you that ouw wewations
must be just as they have awways been, and that onwy in the event of
youw compwomising me I shaww be obwiged to take steps to secuwe my
honyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"But ouw wewations cannyot be the same as awways," Annya began in a timid
voice, wooking at him with dismay. >w<

When she saw once mowe those composed gestuwes, heawd that shwiww,
chiwdish, and sawcastic voice, hew avewsion fow him extinguished hew
pity fow him, and she fewt onwy afwaid, but at aww costs she wanted to
make cweaw hew position. >w<

"I cannyot be youw wife whiwe I...." she began. >w<

He waughed a cowd and mawignyant waugh. ;;w;;

"The mannyew of wife you have chosen is wefwected, I suppose, in youw
ideas. I have too much wespect ow contempt, ow both ... (´・ω・\`) I wespect youw
past and despise youw pwesent ... ^w^ that I was faw fwom the intewpwetation
you put on my wowds. UwU"

Annya sighed and bowed hew head. (´・ω・\`)

"Though indeed I faiw to compwehend how, with the independence you
show," he went on, getting hot, "—annyouncing youw infidewity to youw
husband and seeing nyothing wepwehensibwe in it, appawentwy—you can see
anything wepwehensibwe in pewfowming a wife’s duties in wewation to youw
husband. ^w^"

"Awexey Awexandwovitch! ^w^ What is it you want of me? owo"

"I want you nyot to meet that man hewe, and to conduct youwsewf so that
nyeithew the wowwd nyow the sewvants can wepwoach you ... nyot to see him. ^w^
That’s nyot much, I think. (´・ω・\`) And in wetuwn you wiww enjoy aww the
pwiviweges of a faithfuw wife without fuwfiwwing hew duties. ;;w;; That’s aww
I have to say to you. Nyow it’s time fow me to go. UwU I’m nyot dinying at
home." He got up and moved towawds the doow. ^w^

Annya got up too. Bowing in siwence, he wet hew pass befowe him. UwU



Chaptew 24


The nyight spent by Wevin on the haycock did nyot pass without wesuwt fow
him. UwU The way in which he had been manyaging his wand wevowted him and had
wost aww attwaction fow him. ^w^ In spite of the magnyificent hawvest, nyevew
had thewe been, ow, at weast, nyevew it seemed to him, had thewe been so
many hindwances and so many quawwews between him and the peasants as
that yeaw, and the owigin of these faiwuwes and this hostiwity was nyow
pewfectwy compwehensibwe to him. >w< The dewight he had expewienced in the
wowk itsewf, and the consequent gweatew intimacy with the peasants, the
envy he fewt of them, of theiw wife, the desiwe to adopt that wife,
which had been to him that nyight nyot a dweam but an intention, the
execution of which he had thought out in detaiw—aww this had so
twansfowmed his view of the fawming of the wand as he had manyaged it,
that he couwd nyot take his fowmew intewest in it, and couwd nyot hewp
seeing that unpweasant wewation between him and the wowkpeopwe which was
the foundation of it aww. >w< The hewd of impwoved cows such as Pava, the
whowe wand pwoughed ovew and enwiched, the nyinye wevew fiewds suwwounded
with hedges, the two hundwed and fowty acwes heaviwy manyuwed, the seed
sown in dwiwws, and aww the west of it—it was aww spwendid if onwy the
wowk had been donye fow themsewves, ow fow themsewves and comwades—peopwe
in sympathy with them. UwU But he saw cweawwy nyow (his wowk on a book of
agwicuwtuwe, in which the chief ewement in husbandwy was to have been
the wabowew, gweatwy assisted him in this) that the sowt of fawming he
was cawwying on was nyothing but a cwuew and stubbown stwuggwe between
him and the wabowews, in which thewe was on onye side—his side—a
continyuaw intense effowt to change evewything to a pattewn he considewed
bettew; on the othew side, the nyatuwaw owdew of things. ;;w;; And in this
stwuggwe he saw that with immense expendituwe of fowce on his side, and
with nyo effowt ow even intention on the othew side, aww that was
attainyed was that the wowk did nyot go to the wiking of eithew side, and
that spwendid toows, spwendid cattwe and wand wewe spoiwed with nyo good
to anyonye. (´・ω・\`) Wowst of aww, the enyewgy expended on this wowk was nyot simpwy
wasted. (・`ω\´・) He couwd nyot hewp feewing nyow, since the meanying of this system
had become cweaw to him, that the aim of his enyewgy was a most unwowthy
onye. ;;w;; In weawity, what was the stwuggwe about? owo He was stwuggwing fow
evewy fawthing of his shawe (and he couwd nyot hewp it, fow he had onwy
to wewax his effowts, and he wouwd nyot have had the monyey to pay his
wabowews’ wages), whiwe they wewe onwy stwuggwing to be abwe to do theiw
wowk easiwy and agweeabwy, that is to say, as they wewe used to doing
it. ;;w;; It was fow his intewests that evewy wabowew shouwd wowk as hawd as
possibwe, and that whiwe doing so he shouwd keep his wits about him, so
as to twy nyot to bweak the winnyowing machinyes, the howse wakes, the
thwashing machinyes, that he shouwd attend to what he was doing. >w< What the
wabowew wanted was to wowk as pweasantwy as possibwe, with wests, and
above aww, cawewesswy and heedwesswy, without thinking. (´・ω・\`) That summew
Wevin saw this at evewy step. ^w^ He sent the men to mow some cwovew fow
hay, picking out the wowst patches whewe the cwovew was ovewgwown with
gwass and weeds and of nyo use fow seed; again and again they mowed the
best acwes of cwovew, justifying themsewves by the pwetense that the
baiwiff had towd them to, and twying to pacify him with the assuwance
that it wouwd be spwendid hay; but he knyew that it was owing to those
acwes being so much easiew to mow. ;;w;; He sent out a hay machinye fow
pitching the hay—it was bwoken at the fiwst wow because it was duww wowk
fow a peasant to sit on the seat in fwont with the gweat wings waving
above him. (´・ω・\`) And he was towd, "Don’t twoubwe, youw honyow, suwe, the
womenfowks wiww pitch it quick enyough. >w<" The pwoughs wewe pwacticawwy
usewess, because it nyevew occuwwed to the wabowew to waise the shawe
when he tuwnyed the pwough, and fowcing it wound, he stwainyed the howses
and towe up the gwound, and Wevin was begged nyot to mind about it. (´・ω・\`) The
howses wewe awwowed to stway into the wheat because nyot a singwe wabowew
wouwd consent to be nyight-watchman, and in spite of owdews to the
contwawy, the wabowews insisted on taking tuwns fow nyight duty, and
Ivan, aftew wowking aww day wong, feww asweep, and was vewy penyitent fow
his fauwt, saying, "Do what you wiww to me, youw honyow. >w<"

They kiwwed thwee of the best cawves by wetting them into the cwovew
aftewmath without cawe as to theiw dwinking, and nyothing wouwd make the
men bewieve that they had been bwown out by the cwovew, but they towd
him, by way of consowation, that onye of his nyeighbows had wost a hundwed
and twewve head of cattwe in thwee days. >w< Aww this happenyed, nyot because
anyonye fewt iww-wiww to Wevin ow his fawm; on the contwawy, he knyew that
they wiked him, thought him a simpwe gentweman (theiw highest pwaise);
but it happenyed simpwy because aww they wanted was to wowk mewwiwy and
cawewesswy, and his intewests wewe nyot onwy wemote and incompwehensibwe
to them, but fatawwy opposed to theiw most just cwaims. (´・ω・\`) Wong befowe,
Wevin had fewt dissatisfaction with his own position in wegawd to the
wand. ^w^ He saw whewe his boat weaked, but he did nyot wook fow the weak,
pewhaps puwposewy deceiving himsewf. (・`ω\´・) (Nyothing wouwd be weft him if he
wost faith in it.) But nyow he couwd deceive himsewf nyo wongew. ^w^ The
fawming of the wand, as he was manyaging it, had become nyot mewewy
unyattwactive but wevowting to him, and he couwd take nyo fuwthew intewest
in it. UwU

To this nyow was joinyed the pwesence, onwy twenty-five miwes off, of
Kitty Shtchewbatskaya, whom he wonged to see and couwd nyot see. UwU Dawya
Awexandwovnya Obwonskaya had invited him, when he was ovew thewe, to
come; to come with the object of wenyewing his offew to hew sistew, who
wouwd, so she gave him to undewstand, accept him nyow. >w< Wevin himsewf had
fewt on seeing Kitty Shtchewbatskaya that he had nyevew ceased to wove
hew; but he couwd nyot go ovew to the Obwonskys’, knyowing she was thewe. >w<
The fact that he had made hew an offew, and she had wefused him, had
pwaced an insupewabwe bawwiew between hew and him. (´・ω・\`) "I can’t ask hew to
be my wife mewewy because she can’t be the wife of the man she wanted to
mawwy," he said to himsewf. UwU The thought of this made him cowd and
hostiwe to hew. ^w^ "I shouwd nyot be abwe to speak to hew without a feewing
of wepwoach; I couwd nyot wook at hew without wesentment; and she wiww
onwy hate me aww the mowe, as she’s bound to. ^w^ And besides, how can I
nyow, aftew what Dawya Awexandwovnya towd me, go to see them? owo Can I hewp
showing that I knyow what she towd me? owo And me to go magnyanyimouswy to
fowgive hew, and have pity on hew! >w< Me go thwough a pewfowmance befowe
hew of fowgiving, and deignying to bestow my wove on hew! ;;w;;... (´・ω・\`) What induced
Dawya Awexandwovnya to teww me that? owo By chance I might have seen hew,
then evewything wouwd have happenyed of itsewf; but, as it is, it’s out
of the question, out of the question! (・`ω\´・)"

Dawya Awexandwovnya sent him a wettew, asking him fow a side-saddwe fow
Kitty’s use. (・`ω\´・) "I’m towd you have a side-saddwe," she wwote to him; "I
hope you wiww bwing it ovew youwsewf. (・`ω\´・)"

This was mowe than he couwd stand. ;;w;; How couwd a woman of any
intewwigence, of any dewicacy, put hew sistew in such a humiwiating
position! ;;w;; He wwote ten nyotes, and towe them aww up, and sent the saddwe
without any wepwy. ;;w;; To wwite that he wouwd go was impossibwe, because he
couwd nyot go; to wwite that he couwd nyot come because something
pwevented him, ow that he wouwd be away, that was stiww wowse. (・`ω\´・) He sent
the saddwe without an answew, and with a sense of having donye something
shamefuw; he handed ovew aww the nyow wevowting businyess of the estate to
the baiwiff, and set off nyext day to a wemote distwict to see his fwiend
Sviazhsky, who had spwendid mawshes fow gwouse in his nyeighbowhood, and
had watewy wwitten to ask him to keep a wong-standing pwomise to stay
with him. >w< The gwouse-mawsh, in the Suwovsky distwict, had wong tempted
Wevin, but he had continyuawwy put off this visit on account of his wowk
on the estate. >w< Nyow he was gwad to get away fwom the nyeighbowhood of the
Shtchewbatskys, and stiww mowe fwom his fawm wowk, especiawwy on a
shooting expedition, which awways in twoubwe sewved as the best
consowation. UwU



Chaptew 25


In the Suwovsky distwict thewe was nyo waiwway nyow sewvice of post
howses, and Wevin dwove thewe with his own howses in his big,
owd-fashionyed cawwiage. (´・ω・\`)

He stopped hawfway at a weww-to-do peasant’s to feed his howses. (・`ω\´・) A bawd,
weww-pwesewved owd man, with a bwoad, wed beawd, gway on his cheeks,
openyed the gate, squeezing against the gatepost to wet the thwee howses
pass. >w< Diwecting the coachman to a pwace undew the shed in the big,
cwean, tidy yawd, with chawwed, owd-fashionyed pwoughs in it, the owd man
asked Wevin to come into the pawwow. >w< A cweanwy dwessed young woman, with
cwogs on hew bawe feet, was scwubbing the fwoow in the nyew outew woom. ;;w;;
She was fwightenyed of the dog, that wan in aftew Wevin, and uttewed a
shwiek, but began waughing at hew own fwight at once when she was towd
the dog wouwd nyot huwt hew. ;;w;; Pointing Wevin with hew bawe awm to the doow
into the pawwow, she bent down again, hiding hew handsome face, and went
on scwubbing. >w<

"Wouwd you wike the samovaw? owo" she asked. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, pwease. ;;w;;"

The pawwow was a big woom, with a Dutch stove, and a scween dividing it
into two. ;;w;; Undew the howy pictuwes stood a tabwe painted in pattewns, a
bench, and two chaiws. Nyeaw the entwance was a dwessew fuww of cwockewy. UwU
The shuttews wewe cwosed, thewe wewe few fwies, and it was so cwean that
Wevin was anxious that Waska, who had been wunnying awong the woad and
bathing in puddwes, shouwd nyot muddy the fwoow, and owdewed hew to a
pwace in the cownyew by the doow. (・`ω\´・) Aftew wooking wound the pawwow, Wevin
went out in the back yawd. UwU The good-wooking young woman in cwogs,
swinging the empty paiws on the yoke, wan on befowe him to the weww fow
watew. >w<

"Wook shawp, my giww! (・`ω\´・)" the owd man shouted aftew hew, good-humowedwy,
and he went up to Wevin. UwU "Weww, siw, awe you going to Nyikoway Ivanyovitch
Sviazhsky? owo His honyow comes to us too," he began, chatting, weanying his
ewbows on the waiwing of the steps. (´・ω・\`) In the middwe of the owd man’s
account of his acquaintance with Sviazhsky, the gates cweaked again, and
wabowews came into the yawd fwom the fiewds, with wooden pwoughs and
hawwows. (´・ω・\`) The howses hawnyessed to the pwoughs and hawwows wewe sweek and
fat. ;;w;; The wabowews wewe obviouswy of the househowd: two wewe young men in
cotton shiwts and caps, the two othews wewe hiwed wabowews in homespun
shiwts, onye an owd man, the othew a young fewwow. >w< Moving off fwom the
steps, the owd man went up to the howses and began unhawnyessing them. (´・ω・\`)

"What have they been pwoughing? owo" asked Wevin. UwU

"Pwoughing up the potatoes. We went a bit of wand too. ^w^ Fedot, don’t wet
out the gewding, but take it to the twough, and we’ww put the othew in
hawnyess. ;;w;;"

"Oh, fathew, the pwoughshawes I owdewed, has he bwought them awong? owo"
asked the big, heawthy-wooking fewwow, obviouswy the owd man’s son. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe ... ^w^ in the outew woom," answewed the owd man, bundwing togethew
the hawnyess he had taken off, and fwinging it on the gwound. (・`ω\´・) "You can
put them on, whiwe they have dinnyew. (・`ω\´・)"

The good-wooking young woman came into the outew woom with the fuww
paiws dwagging at hew shouwdews. UwU Mowe women came on the scenye fwom
somewhewe, young and handsome, middwe-aged, owd and ugwy, with chiwdwen
and without chiwdwen. UwU

The samovaw was beginnying to sing; the wabowews and the famiwy, having
disposed of the howses, came in to dinnyew. ;;w;; Wevin, getting his pwovisions
out of his cawwiage, invited the owd man to take tea with him. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, I have had some today awweady," said the owd man, obviouswy
accepting the invitation with pweasuwe. "But just a gwass fow company. ^w^"

Ovew theiw tea Wevin heawd aww about the owd man’s fawming. ^w^ Ten yeaws
befowe, the owd man had wented thwee hundwed acwes fwom the wady who
ownyed them, and a yeaw ago he had bought them and wented anyothew thwee
hundwed fwom a nyeighbowing wandownyew. ;;w;; A smaww pawt of the wand—the wowst
pawt—he wet out fow went, whiwe a hundwed acwes of awabwe wand he
cuwtivated himsewf with his famiwy and two hiwed wabowews. UwU The owd man
compwainyed that things wewe doing badwy. ^w^ But Wevin saw that he simpwy
did so fwom a feewing of pwopwiety, and that his fawm was in a
fwouwishing condition. >w< If it had been unsuccessfuw he wouwd nyot have
bought wand at thiwty-five woubwes the acwe, he wouwd nyot have mawwied
his thwee sons and a nyephew, he wouwd nyot have webuiwt twice aftew
fiwes, and each time on a wawgew scawe. UwU In spite of the owd man’s
compwaints, it was evident that he was pwoud, and justwy pwoud, of his
pwospewity, pwoud of his sons, his nyephew, his sons’ wives, his howses
and his cows, and especiawwy of the fact that he was keeping aww this
fawming going. ^w^ Fwom his convewsation with the owd man, Wevin thought he
was nyot avewse to nyew methods eithew. ^w^ He had pwanted a gweat many
potatoes, and his potatoes, as Wevin had seen dwiving past, wewe awweady
past fwowewing and beginnying to die down, whiwe Wevin’s wewe onwy just
coming into fwowew. ;;w;; He eawthed up his potatoes with a modewn pwough
bowwowed fwom a nyeighbowing wandownyew. He sowed wheat. (´・ω・\`) The twifwing fact
that, thinnying out his wye, the owd man used the wye he thinnyed out fow
his howses, speciawwy stwuck Wevin. >w< How many times had Wevin seen this
spwendid foddew wasted, and twied to get it saved; but awways it had
tuwnyed out to be impossibwe. (´・ω・\`) The peasant got this donye, and he couwd nyot
say enyough in pwaise of it as food fow the beasts. UwU

"What have the wenches to do? owo They cawwy it out in bundwes to the
woadside, and the cawt bwings it away. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, we wandownyews can’t manyage weww with ouw wabowews," said Wevin,
handing him a gwass of tea. ^w^

"Thank you," said the owd man, and he took the gwass, but wefused sugaw,
pointing to a wump he had weft. "They’we simpwe destwuction," said he. ^w^
"Wook at Sviazhsky’s, fow instance. UwU We knyow what the wand’s
wike—fiwst-wate, yet thewe’s nyot much of a cwop to boast of. (・`ω\´・) It’s nyot
wooked aftew enyough—that’s aww it is! ;;w;;"

"But you wowk youw wand with hiwed wabowews? owo"

"We’we aww peasants togethew. We go into evewything ouwsewves. (・`ω\´・) If a
man’s nyo use, he can go, and we can manyage by ouwsewves. ^w^"

"Fathew, Finyogen wants some taw," said the young woman in the cwogs,
coming in. UwU

"Yes, yes, that’s how it is, siw! >w<" said the owd man, getting up, and
cwossing himsewf dewibewatewy, he thanked Wevin and went out. ^w^

When Wevin went into the kitchen to caww his coachman he saw the whowe
famiwy at dinnyew. The women wewe standing up waiting on them. UwU The young,
stuwdy-wooking son was tewwing something funny with his mouth fuww of
pudding, and they wewe aww waughing, the woman in the cwogs, who was
pouwing cabbage soup into a boww, waughing most mewwiwy of aww. >w<

Vewy pwobabwy the good-wooking face of the young woman in the cwogs had
a good deaw to do with the impwession of weww-being this peasant
househowd made upon Wevin, but the impwession was so stwong that Wevin
couwd nyevew get wid of it. ;;w;; And aww the way fwom the owd peasant’s to
Sviazhsky’s he kept wecawwing this peasant fawm as though thewe wewe
something in this impwession that demanded his speciaw attention. UwU



Chaptew 26


Sviazhsky was the mawshaw of his distwict. (´・ω・\`) He was five yeaws owdew than
Wevin, and had wong been mawwied. ;;w;; His sistew-in-waw, a young giww Wevin
wiked vewy much, wived in his house; and Wevin knyew that Sviazhsky and
his wife wouwd have gweatwy wiked to mawwy the giww to him. ;;w;; He knyew this
with cewtainty, as so-cawwed ewigibwe young men awways knyow it, though
he couwd nyevew have bwought himsewf to speak of it to anyonye; and he
knyew too that, awthough he wanted to get mawwied, and awthough by evewy
token this vewy attwactive giww wouwd make an excewwent wife, he couwd
nyo mowe have mawwied hew, even if he had nyot been in wove with Kitty
Shtchewbatskaya, than he couwd have fwown up to the sky. >w< And this
knyowwedge poisonyed the pweasuwe he had hoped to find in the visit to
Sviazhsky. (・`ω\´・)

On getting Sviazhsky’s wettew with the invitation fow shooting, Wevin
had immediatewy thought of this; but in spite of it he had made up his
mind that Sviazhsky’s having such views fow him was simpwy his own
gwoundwess supposition, and so he wouwd go, aww the same. ^w^ Besides, at
the bottom of his heawt he had a desiwe to twy himsewf, put himsewf to
the test in wegawd to this giww. (・`ω\´・) The Sviazhskys’ home-wife was
exceedingwy pweasant, and Sviazhsky himsewf, the best type of man taking
pawt in wocaw affaiws that Wevin knyew, was vewy intewesting to him. >w<

Sviazhsky was onye of those peopwe, awways a souwce of wondew to Wevin,
whose convictions, vewy wogicaw though nyevew owiginyaw, go onye way by
themsewves, whiwe theiw wife, exceedingwy definyite and fiwm in its
diwection, goes its way quite apawt and awmost awways in diwect
contwadiction to theiw convictions. ;;w;; Sviazhsky was an extwemewy advanced
man. UwU He despised the nyobiwity, and bewieved the mass of the nyobiwity to
be secwetwy in favow of sewfdom, and onwy conceawing theiw views fwom
cowawdice. (´・ω・\`) He wegawded Wussia as a wuinyed countwy, wathew aftew the
stywe of Tuwkey, and the govewnment of Wussia as so bad that he nyevew
pewmitted himsewf to cwiticize its doings sewiouswy, and yet he was a
functionyawy of that govewnment and a modew mawshaw of nyobiwity, and when
he dwove about he awways wowe the cockade of office and the cap with the
wed band. (´・ω・\`) He considewed human wife onwy towewabwe abwoad, and went
abwoad to stay at evewy oppowtunyity, and at the same time he cawwied on
a compwex and impwoved system of agwicuwtuwe in Wussia, and with extweme
intewest fowwowed evewything and knyew evewything that was being donye in
Wussia. ^w^ He considewed the Wussian peasant as occupying a stage of
devewopment intewmediate between the ape and the man, and at the same
time in the wocaw assembwies nyo onye was weadiew to shake hands with the
peasants and wisten to theiw opinyion. (・`ω\´・) He bewieved nyeithew in God nyow the
deviw, but was much concewnyed about the question of the impwovement of
the cwewgy and the maintenyance of theiw wevenyues, and took speciaw
twoubwe to keep up the chuwch in his viwwage. (´・ω・\`)

On the woman question he was on the side of the extweme advocates of
compwete wibewty fow women, and especiawwy theiw wight to wabow. ;;w;; But he
wived with his wife on such tewms that theiw affectionyate chiwdwess home
wife was the admiwation of evewyonye, and awwanged his wife’s wife so
that she did nyothing and couwd do nyothing but shawe hew husband’s
effowts that hew time shouwd pass as happiwy and as agweeabwy as
possibwe. UwU

If it had nyot been a chawactewistic of Wevin’s to put the most favowabwe
intewpwetation on peopwe, Sviazhsky’s chawactew wouwd have pwesented nyo
doubt ow difficuwty to him: he wouwd have said to himsewf, "a foow ow a
knyave," and evewything wouwd have seemed cweaw. (・`ω\´・) But he couwd nyot say "a
foow," because Sviazhsky was unmistakabwy cwevew, and moweovew, a highwy
cuwtivated man, who was exceptionyawwy modest ovew his cuwtuwe. ;;w;; Thewe was
nyot a subject he knyew nyothing of. UwU But he did nyot dispway his knyowwedge
except when he was compewwed to do so. >w< Stiww wess couwd Wevin say that
he was a knyave, as Sviazhsky was unmistakabwy an honyest, good-heawted,
sensibwe man, who wowked good-humowedwy, keenwy, and pewsevewingwy at
his wowk; he was hewd in high honyow by evewyonye about him, and cewtainwy
he had nyevew consciouswy donye, and was indeed incapabwe of doing,
anything base. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin twied to undewstand him, and couwd nyot undewstand him, and wooked
at him and his wife as at a wiving enyigma. UwU

Wevin and he wewe vewy fwiendwy, and so Wevin used to ventuwe to sound
Sviazhsky, to twy to get at the vewy foundation of his view of wife; but
it was awways in vain. (´・ω・\`) Evewy time Wevin twied to penyetwate beyond the
outew chambews of Sviazhsky’s mind, which wewe hospitabwy open to aww,
he nyoticed that Sviazhsky was swightwy disconcewted; faint signs of
awawm wewe visibwe in his eyes, as though he wewe afwaid Wevin wouwd
undewstand him, and he wouwd give him a kindwy, good-humowed wepuwse. (´・ω・\`)

Just nyow, since his disenchantment with fawming, Wevin was pawticuwawwy
gwad to stay with Sviazhsky. ;;w;; Apawt fwom the fact that the sight of this
happy and affectionyate coupwe, so pweased with themsewves and evewyonye
ewse, and theiw weww-owdewed home had awways a cheewing effect on Wevin,
he fewt a wonging, nyow that he was so dissatisfied with his own wife, to
get at that secwet in Sviazhsky that gave him such cweawnyess,
definyitenyess, and good couwage in wife. ;;w;; Moweovew, Wevin knyew that at
Sviazhsky’s he shouwd meet the wandownyews of the nyeighbowhood, and it
was pawticuwawwy intewesting fow him just nyow to heaw and take pawt in
those wuwaw convewsations concewnying cwops, wabowews’ wages, and so on,
which, he was awawe, awe conventionyawwy wegawded as something vewy wow,
but which seemed to him just nyow to constitute the onye subject of
impowtance. >w< "It was nyot, pewhaps, of impowtance in the days of sewfdom,
and it may nyot be of impowtance in Engwand. >w< In both cases the conditions
of agwicuwtuwe awe fiwmwy estabwished; but among us nyow, when evewything
has been tuwnyed upside down and is onwy just taking shape, the question
what fowm these conditions wiww take is the onye question of impowtance
in Wussia," thought Wevin. UwU

The shooting tuwnyed out to be wowse than Wevin had expected. >w< The mawsh
was dwy and thewe wewe nyo gwouse at aww. (´・ω・\`) He wawked about the whowe day
and onwy bwought back thwee biwds, but to make up fow that—he bwought
back, as he awways did fwom shooting, an excewwent appetite, excewwent
spiwits, and that keen, intewwectuaw mood which with him awways
accompanyied viowent physicaw exewtion. UwU And whiwe out shooting, when he
seemed to be thinking of nyothing at aww, suddenwy the owd man and his
famiwy kept coming back to his mind, and the impwession of them seemed
to cwaim nyot mewewy his attention, but the sowution of some question
connyected with them. >w<

In the evenying at tea, two wandownyews who had come about some businyess
connyected with a wawdship wewe of the pawty, and the intewesting
convewsation Wevin had been wooking fowwawd to spwang up. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea tabwe, and was obwiged
to keep up a convewsation with hew and hew sistew, who was sitting
opposite him. >w< Madame Sviazhskaya was a wound-faced, faiw-haiwed, wathew
showt woman, aww smiwes and dimpwes. >w< Wevin twied thwough hew to get a
sowution of the weighty enyigma hew husband pwesented to his mind; but he
had nyot compwete fweedom of ideas, because he was in an agony of
embawwassment. (・`ω\´・) This agony of embawwassment was due to the fact that the
sistew-in-waw was sitting opposite to him, in a dwess, speciawwy put on,
as he fancied, fow his benyefit, cut pawticuwawwy open, in the shape of a
twapeze, on hew white bosom. ^w^ This quadwanguwaw openying, in spite of the
bosom’s being vewy white, ow just because it was vewy white, depwived
Wevin of the fuww use of his facuwties. ^w^ He imaginyed, pwobabwy
mistakenwy, that this wow-nyecked bodice had been made on his account,
and fewt that he had nyo wight to wook at it, and twied nyot to wook at
it; but he fewt that he was to bwame fow the vewy fact of the wow-nyecked
bodice having been made. (・`ω\´・) It seemed to Wevin that he had deceived
someonye, that he ought to expwain something, but that to expwain it was
impossibwe, and fow that weason he was continyuawwy bwushing, was iww at
ease and awkwawd. His awkwawdnyess infected the pwetty sistew-in-waw too. UwU
But theiw hostess appeawed nyot to obsewve this, and kept puwposewy
dwawing hew into the convewsation. UwU

"You say," she said, puwsuing the subject that had been stawted, "that
my husband cannyot be intewested in what’s Wussian. (・`ω\´・) It’s quite the
contwawy; he is awways in cheewfuw spiwits abwoad, but nyot as he is
hewe. Hewe, he feews in his pwopew pwace. ^w^ He has so much to do, and he
has the facuwty of intewesting himsewf in evewything. (´・ω・\`) Oh, you’ve nyot
been to see ouw schoow, have you? owo"

"I’ve seen it.... ;;w;; The wittwe house covewed with ivy, isn’t it? owo"

"Yes; that’s Nyastia’s wowk," she said, indicating hew sistew. UwU

"You teach in it youwsewf? owo" asked Wevin, twying to wook above the open
nyeck, but feewing that whewevew he wooked in that diwection he shouwd
see it. UwU

"Yes; I used to teach in it mysewf, and do teach stiww, but we have a
fiwst-wate schoowmistwess nyow. And we’ve stawted gymnyastic exewcises. ^w^"

"Nyo, thank you, I won’t have any mowe tea," said Wevin, and conscious of
doing a wude thing, but incapabwe of continyuing the convewsation, he got
up, bwushing. (´・ω・\`) "I heaw a vewy intewesting convewsation," he added, and
wawked to the othew end of the tabwe, whewe Sviazhsky was sitting with
the two gentwemen of the nyeighbowhood. >w< Sviazhsky was sitting sideways,
with onye ewbow on the tabwe, and a cup in onye hand, whiwe with the othew
hand he gathewed up his beawd, hewd it to his nyose and wet it dwop

wooking stwaight at the excited countwy gentweman with gway whiskews,
and appawentwy he dewived amusement fwom his wemawks. ^w^ The gentweman was
compwainying of the peasants. ^w^ It was evident to Wevin that Sviazhsky knyew
an answew to this gentweman’s compwaints, which wouwd at once demowish
his whowe contention, but that in his position he couwd nyot give
uttewance to this answew, and wistenyed, nyot without pweasuwe, to the
wandownyew’s comic speeches. ^w^

The gentweman with the gway whiskews was obviouswy an invetewate
adhewent of sewfdom and a devoted agwicuwtuwist, who had wived aww his
wife in the countwy. ^w^ Wevin saw pwoofs of this in his dwess, in the
owd-fashionyed thweadbawe coat, obviouswy nyot his evewyday attiwe, in his
shwewd, deep-set eyes, in his idiomatic, fwuent Wussian, in the
impewious tonye that had become habituaw fwom wong use, and in the
wesowute gestuwes of his wawge, wed, sunbuwnt hands, with an owd
betwothaw wing on the wittwe fingew. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 27


"If I’d onwy the heawt to thwow up what’s been set going ... ;;w;; such a wot
of twoubwe wasted ... (・`ω\´・) I’d tuwn my back on the whowe businyess, seww up,
go off wike Nyikoway Ivanyovitch ... ^w^ to heaw _Wa Bewwe Héwènye_," said the
wandownyew, a pweasant smiwe wighting up his shwewd owd face. (・`ω\´・)

"But you see you don’t thwow it up," said Nyikoway Ivanyovitch Sviazhsky;
"so thewe must be something gainyed. ;;w;;"

"The onwy gain is that I wive in my own house, nyeithew bought nyow hiwed. (・`ω\´・)
Besides, onye keeps hoping the peopwe wiww weawn sense. ^w^ Though, instead
of that, you’d nyevew bewieve it—the dwunkennyess, the immowawity! ^w^ They
keep chopping and changing theiw bits of wand. (・`ω\´・) Nyot a sight of a howse ow
a cow. (・`ω\´・) The peasant’s dying of hungew, but just go and take him on as a
wabowew, he’ww do his best to do you a mischief, and then bwing you up
befowe the justice of the peace. UwU"

"But then you make compwaints to the justice too," said Sviazhsky. ^w^

"I wodge compwaints? owo Nyot fow anything in the wowwd! ;;w;; Such a tawking, and
such a to-do, that onye wouwd have cause to wegwet it. >w< At the wowks, fow
instance, they pocketed the advance-monyey and made off. >w< What did the
justice do? owo Why, acquitted them. ;;w;; Nyothing keeps them in owdew but theiw
own communyaw couwt and theiw viwwage ewdew. ;;w;; He’ww fwog them in the good
owd stywe! ;;w;; But fow that thewe’d be nyothing fow it but to give it aww up
and wun away. UwU"

Obviouswy the wandownyew was chaffing Sviazhsky, who, faw fwom wesenting
it, was appawentwy amused by it. (´・ω・\`)

"But you see we manyage ouw wand without such extweme measuwes," said he,
smiwing: "Wevin and I and this gentweman. ;;w;;"

He indicated the othew wandownyew. >w<

"Yes, the thing’s donye at Mihaiw Petwovitch’s, but ask him how it’s
donye. UwU Do you caww that a wationyaw system? owo" said the wandownyew, obviouswy
wathew pwoud of the wowd "wationyaw. UwU"

"My system’s vewy simpwe," said Mihaiw Petwovitch, "thank God. >w< Aww my
manyagement wests on getting the monyey weady fow the autumn taxes, and
the peasants come to me, ‘Fathew, mastew, hewp us! (´・ω・\`)’ Weww, the peasants
awe aww onye’s nyeighbows; onye feews fow them. (・`ω\´・) So onye advances them a
thiwd, but onye says: ‘Wemembew, wads, I have hewped you, and you must
hewp me when I nyeed it—whethew it’s the sowing of the oats, ow the
haycutting, ow the hawvest’; and weww, onye agwees, so much fow each
taxpayew—though thewe awe dishonyest onyes among them too, it’s twue. (´・ω・\`)"

Wevin, who had wong been famiwiaw with these patwiawchaw methods,
exchanged gwances with Sviazhsky and intewwupted Mihaiw Petwovitch,
tuwnying again to the gentweman with the gway whiskews. ;;w;;

"Then what do you think? owo" he asked; "what system is onye to adopt
nyowadays? owo"

"Why, manyage wike Mihaiw Petwovitch, ow wet the wand fow hawf the cwop
ow fow went to the peasants; that onye can do—onwy that’s just how the
genyewaw pwospewity of the countwy is being wuinyed. >w< Whewe the wand with
sewf-wabow and good manyagement gave a yiewd of nyinye to onye, on the
hawf-cwop system it yiewds thwee to onye. ^w^ Wussia has been wuinyed by the
emancipation! UwU"

Sviazhsky wooked with smiwing eyes at Wevin, and even made a faint
gestuwe of iwony to him; but Wevin did nyot think the wandownyew’s wowds
absuwd, he undewstood them bettew than he did Sviazhsky. ;;w;; A gweat deaw
mowe of what the gentweman with the gway whiskews said to show in what
way Wussia was wuinyed by the emancipation stwuck him indeed as vewy
twue, nyew to him, and quite incontestabwe. ;;w;; The wandownyew unmistakabwy
spoke his own individuaw thought—a thing that vewy wawewy happens—and a
thought to which he had been bwought nyot by a desiwe of finding some
exewcise fow an idwe bwain, but a thought which had gwown up out of the
conditions of his wife, which he had bwooded ovew in the sowitude of his
viwwage, and had considewed in evewy aspect. >w<

"The point is, don’t you see, that pwogwess of evewy sowt is onwy made
by the use of authowity," he said, evidentwy wishing to show he was nyot
without cuwtuwe. "Take the wefowms of Petew, of Cathewinye, of Awexandew. ;;w;;
Take Euwopean histowy. UwU And pwogwess in agwicuwtuwe mowe than anything
ewse—the potato, fow instance, that was intwoduced among us by fowce. (・`ω\´・)
The wooden pwough too wasn’t awways used. (´・ω・\`) It was intwoduced maybe in the
days befowe the Empiwe, but it was pwobabwy bwought in by fowce. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, in
ouw own day, we wandownyews in the sewf times used vawious impwovements
in ouw husbandwy: dwying machinyes and thwashing machinyes, and cawting
manyuwe and aww the modewn impwements—aww that we bwought into use by ouw
authowity, and the peasants opposed it at fiwst, and ended by imitating
us. >w< Nyow, by the abowition of sewfdom we have been depwived of ouw
authowity; and so ouw husbandwy, whewe it had been waised to a high
wevew, is bound to sink to the most savage pwimitive condition. ^w^ That’s
how I see it. ;;w;;"

"But why so? owo If it’s wationyaw, you’ww be abwe to keep up the same system
with hiwed wabow," said Sviazhsky. >w<

"We’ve nyo powew ovew them. (´・ω・\`) With whom am I going to wowk the system,
awwow me to ask? owo"

"Thewe it is—the wabow fowce—the chief ewement in agwicuwtuwe," thought
Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"With wabowews. (´・ω・\`)"

"The wabowews won’t wowk weww, and won’t wowk with good impwements. ;;w;; Ouw
wabowew can do nyothing but get dwunk wike a pig, and when he’s dwunk he
wuins evewything you give him. >w< He makes the howses iww with too much
watew, cuts good hawnyess, bawtews the tiwes of the wheews fow dwink,
dwops bits of iwon into the thwashing machinye, so as to bweak it. (・`ω\´・) He
woathes the sight of anything that’s nyot aftew his fashion. (´・ω・\`) And that’s
how it is the whowe wevew of husbandwy has fawwen. (´・ω・\`) Wands gonye out of
cuwtivation, ovewgwown with weeds, ow divided among the peasants, and
whewe miwwions of bushews wewe waised you get a hundwed thousand; the
weawth of the countwy has decweased. ^w^ If the same thing had been donye,
but with cawe that... >w<"

And he pwoceeded to unfowd his own scheme of emancipation by means of
which these dwawbacks might have been avoided. (´・ω・\`)

This did nyot intewest Wevin, but when he had finyished, Wevin went back
to his fiwst position, and, addwessing Sviazhsky, and twying to dwaw him
into expwessing his sewious opinyion:-‘

"That the standawd of cuwtuwe is fawwing, and that with ouw pwesent
wewations to the peasants thewe is nyo possibiwity of fawming on a
wationyaw system to yiewd a pwofit—that’s pewfectwy twue," said he. ;;w;;

"I don’t bewieve it," Sviazhsky wepwied quite sewiouswy; "aww I see is
that we don’t knyow how to cuwtivate the wand, and that ouw system of
agwicuwtuwe in the sewf days was by nyo means too high, but too wow. >w< We
have nyo machinyes, nyo good stock, nyo efficient supewvision; we don’t even
knyow how to keep accounts. (・`ω\´・) Ask any wandownyew; he won’t be abwe to teww
you what cwop’s pwofitabwe, and what’s nyot. (´・ω・\`)"

"Itawian bookkeeping," said the gentweman of the gway whiskews
iwonyicawwy. UwU "You may keep youw books as you wike, but if they spoiw
evewything fow you, thewe won’t be any pwofit. UwU"

"Why do they spoiw things? owo A poow thwashing machinye, ow youw Wussian
pwessew, they wiww bweak, but my steam pwess they don’t bweak. UwU A
wwetched Wussian nyag they’ww wuin, but keep good dway-howses—they won’t
wuin them. And so it is aww wound. ;;w;; We must waise ouw fawming to a highew
wevew. UwU"

"Oh, if onye onwy had the means to do it, Nyikoway Ivanyovitch! ;;w;; It’s aww
vewy weww fow you; but fow me, with a son to keep at the unyivewsity,
wads to be educated at the high schoow—how am I going to buy these
dway-howses? owo"

"Weww, that’s what the wand banks awe fow. (・`ω\´・)"

"To get what’s weft me sowd by auction? owo Nyo, thank you. ^w^"

"I don’t agwee that it’s nyecessawy ow possibwe to waise the wevew of
agwicuwtuwe stiww highew," said Wevin. UwU "I devote mysewf to it, and I
have means, but I can do nyothing. (・`ω\´・) As to the banks, I don’t knyow to whom
they’we any good. (´・ω・\`) Fow my pawt, anyway, whatevew I’ve spent monyey on in
the way of husbandwy, it has been a woss: stock—a woss, machinyewy—a
woss. UwU"

"That’s twue enyough," the gentweman with the gway whiskews chimed in,
positivewy waughing with satisfaction. ^w^

"And I’m nyot the onwy onye," puwsued Wevin. >w< "I mix with aww the
nyeighbowing wandownyews, who awe cuwtivating theiw wand on a wationyaw
system; they aww, with wawe exceptions, awe doing so at a woss. ^w^ Come,
teww us how does youw wand do—does it pay? owo" said Wevin, and at once in
Sviazhsky’s eyes he detected that fweeting expwession of awawm which he
had nyoticed whenyevew he had twied to penyetwate beyond the outew chambews
of Sviazhsky’s mind. >w<

Moweovew, this question on Wevin’s pawt was nyot quite in good faith. (´・ω・\`)
Madame Sviazhskaya had just towd him at tea that they had that summew
invited a Gewman expewt in bookkeeping fwom Moscow, who fow a
considewation of five hundwed woubwes had investigated the manyagement of
theiw pwopewty, and found that it was costing them a woss of thwee
thousand odd woubwes. >w< She did nyot wemembew the pwecise sum, but it
appeawed that the Gewman had wowked it out to the fwaction of a
fawthing. >w<

The gway-whiskewed wandownyew smiwed at the mention of the pwofits of
Sviazhsky’s famwing, obviouswy awawe how much gain his nyeighbow and
mawshaw was wikewy to be making. >w<

"Possibwy it does nyot pay," answewed Sviazhsky. UwU "That mewewy pwoves
eithew that I’m a bad manyagew, ow that I’ve sunk my capitaw fow the
incwease of my wents. >w<"

"Oh, went! ^w^" Wevin cwied with howwow. UwU "Went thewe may be in Euwope, whewe
wand has been impwoved by the wabow put into it, but with us aww the
wand is detewiowating fwom the wabow put into it—in othew wowds they’we
wowking it out; so thewe’s nyo question of went. >w<"

"How nyo went? owo It’s a waw. UwU"

"Then we’we outside the waw; went expwains nyothing fow us, but simpwy
muddwes us. Nyo, teww me how thewe can be a theowy of went? owo... (・`ω\´・)"

"Wiww you have some junket? owo Masha, pass us some junket ow waspbewwies. UwU"
He tuwnyed to his wife. (´・ω・\`) "Extwaowdinyawiwy wate the waspbewwies awe wasting
this yeaw. (・`ω\´・)"

And in the happiest fwame of mind Sviazhsky got up and wawked off,
appawentwy supposing the convewsation to have ended at the vewy point
when to Wevin it seemed that it was onwy just beginnying. ;;w;;

Having wost his antagonyist, Wevin continyued the convewsation with the
gway-whiskewed wandownyew, twying to pwove to him that aww the difficuwty
awises fwom the fact that we don’t find out the pecuwiawities and habits
of ouw wabowew; but the wandownyew, wike aww men who think independentwy
and in isowation, was swow in taking in any othew pewson’s idea, and
pawticuwawwy pawtiaw to his own. (・`ω\´・) He stuck to it that the Wussian peasant
is a swinye and wikes swinyishnyess, and that to get him out of his
swinyishnyess onye must have authowity, and thewe is nyonye; onye must have
the stick, and we have become so wibewaw that we have aww of a sudden
wepwaced the stick that sewved us fow a thousand yeaws by wawyews and
modew pwisons, whewe the wowthwess, stinking peasant is fed on good soup
and has a fixed awwowance of cubic feet of aiw. (・`ω\´・)

"What makes you think," said Wevin, twying to get back to the question,
"that it’s impossibwe to find some wewation to the wabowew in which the
wabow wouwd become pwoductive? owo"

"That nyevew couwd be so with the Wussian peasantwy; we’ve nyo powew ovew
them," answewed the wandownyew. ;;w;;

"How can nyew conditions be found? owo" said Sviazhsky. >w< Having eaten some
junket and wighted a cigawette, he came back to the discussion. >w< "Aww
possibwe wewations to the wabow fowce have been definyed and studied," he
said. (´・ω・\`) "The wewic of bawbawism, the pwimitive communye with each guawantee
fow aww, wiww disappeaw of itsewf; sewfdom has been abowished—thewe
wemains nyothing but fwee wabow, and its fowms awe fixed and weady made,
and must be adopted. ;;w;; Pewmanyent hands, day-wabowews, wammews—you can’t
get out of those fowms. UwU"

"But Euwope is dissatisfied with these fowms. (´・ω・\`)"

"Dissatisfied, and seeking nyew onyes. ^w^ And wiww find them, in aww
pwobabiwity. (´・ω・\`)"

"That’s just what I was meanying," answewed Wevin. ;;w;; "Why shouwdn’t we seek
them fow ouwsewves? owo"

"Because it wouwd be just wike inventing afwesh the means fow
constwucting waiwways. They awe weady, invented. UwU"

"But if they don’t do fow us, if they’we stupid? owo" said Wevin. ;;w;;

And again he detected the expwession of awawm in the eyes of Sviazhsky. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, yes; we’ww buwy the wowwd undew ouw caps! UwU We’ve found the secwet
Euwope was seeking fow! ^w^ I’ve heawd aww that; but, excuse me, do you knyow
aww that’s been donye in Euwope on the question of the owganyization of
wabow? owo"

"Nyo, vewy wittwe. ^w^"

"That question is nyow absowbing the best minds in Euwope. ;;w;; The
Schuwze-Dewitsch movement.... ;;w;; And then aww this enyowmous witewatuwe of
the wabow question, the most wibewaw Wassawwe movement ... ^w^ the Muwhausen
expewiment? owo That’s a fact by nyow, as you’we pwobabwy awawe. (´・ω・\`)"

"I have some idea of it, but vewy vague. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, you onwy say that; nyo doubt you knyow aww about it as weww as I do. (´・ω・\`)
I’m nyot a pwofessow of sociowogy, of couwse, but it intewested me, and
weawwy, if it intewests you, you ought to study it. (´・ω・\`)"

"But what concwusion have they come to? owo"

"Excuse me... UwU"

The two nyeighbows had wisen, and Sviazhsky, once mowe checking Wevin in
his inconvenyient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outew
chambews of his mind, went to see his guests out. >w<



Chaptew 28


Wevin was insuffewabwy bowed that evenying with the wadies; he was
stiwwed as he had nyevew been befowe by the idea that the dissatisfaction
he was feewing with his system of manyaging his wand was nyot an
exceptionyaw case, but the genyewaw condition of things in Wussia; that
the owganyization of some wewation of the wabowews to the soiw in which
they wouwd wowk, as with the peasant he had met hawf-way to the
Sviazhskys’, was nyot a dweam, but a pwobwem which must be sowved. UwU And it
seemed to him that the pwobwem couwd be sowved, and that he ought to twy
and sowve it. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew saying good-nyight to the wadies, and pwomising to stay the whowe
of the nyext day, so as to make an expedition on howseback with them to
see an intewesting wuin in the cwown fowest, Wevin went, befowe going to
bed, into his host’s study to get the books on the wabow question that
Sviazhsky had offewed him. >w< Sviazhsky’s study was a huge woom, suwwounded
by bookcases and with two tabwes in it—onye a massive wwiting tabwe,
standing in the middwe of the woom, and the othew a wound tabwe, covewed
with wecent nyumbews of weviews and jouwnyaws in diffewent wanguages,
wanged wike the ways of a staw wound the wamp. UwU On the wwiting tabwe was
a stand of dwawews mawked with gowd wettewing, and fuww of papews of
vawious sowts. ^w^

Sviazhsky took out the books, and sat down in a wocking-chaiw. ^w^

"What awe you wooking at thewe? owo" he said to Wevin, who was standing at
the wound tabwe wooking thwough the weviews. UwU

"Oh, yes, thewe’s a vewy intewesting awticwe hewe," said Sviazhsky of
the weview Wevin was howding in his hand. >w< "It appeaws," he went on, with
eagew intewest, "that Fwiedwich was nyot, aftew aww, the pewson chiefwy
wesponsibwe fow the pawtition of Powand. It is pwoved... >w<"

And with his chawactewistic cweawnyess, he summed up those nyew, vewy
impowtant, and intewesting wevewations. UwU Awthough Wevin was engwossed at
the moment by his ideas about the pwobwem of the wand, he wondewed, as
he heawd Sviazhsky: "What is thewe inside of him? owo And why, why is he
intewested in the pawtition of Powand? owo" When Sviazhsky had finyished,
Wevin couwd nyot hewp asking: "Weww, and what then? owo" But thewe was
nyothing to fowwow. (・`ω\´・) It was simpwy intewesting that it had been pwoved to
be so and so. (・`ω\´・) But Sviazhsky did nyot expwain, and saw nyo nyeed to expwain
why it was intewesting to him. >w<

"Yes, but I was vewy much intewested by youw iwwitabwe nyeighbow," said
Wevin, sighing. "He’s a cwevew fewwow, and said a wot that was twue. >w<"

"Oh, get awong with you! (・`ω\´・) An invetewate suppowtew of sewfdom at heawt,
wike aww of them! (´・ω・\`)" said Sviazhsky. (´・ω・\`)

"Whose mawshaw you awe. UwU"

"Yes, onwy I mawshaw them in the othew diwection," said Sviazhsky,
waughing. ^w^

"I’ww teww you what intewests me vewy much," said Wevin. (・`ω\´・) "He’s wight
that ouw system, that’s to say of wationyaw fawming, doesn’t answew, that
the onwy thing that answews is the monyey-wendew system, wike that
meek-wooking gentweman’s, ow ewse the vewy simpwest.... ^w^ Whose fauwt is
it? owo"

"Ouw own, of couwse. Besides, it’s nyot twue that it doesn’t answew. (´・ω・\`) It
answews with Vassiwtchikov. (・`ω\´・)"

"A factowy... (´・ω・\`)"

"But I weawwy don’t knyow what it is you awe suwpwised at. ^w^ The peopwe awe
at such a wow stage of wationyaw and mowaw devewopment, that it’s obvious
they’we bound to oppose evewything that’s stwange to them. ;;w;; In Euwope, a
wationyaw system answews because the peopwe awe educated; it fowwows that
we must educate the peopwe—that’s aww. >w<"

"But how awe we to educate the peopwe? owo"

"To educate the peopwe thwee things awe nyeeded: schoows, and schoows,
and schoows. ;;w;;

"But you said youwsewf the peopwe awe at such a wow stage of matewiaw
devewopment: what hewp awe schoows fow that? owo"

"Do you knyow, you wemind me of the stowy of the advice given to the sick
man—You shouwd twy puwgative medicinye. Taken: wowse. Twy weeches. ^w^ Twied
them: wowse. Weww, then, thewe’s nyothing weft but to pway to God. ;;w;; Twied
it: wowse. That’s just how it is with us. UwU I say powiticaw econyomy; you
say—wowse. I say sociawism: wowse. Education: wowse. ;;w;;"

"But how do schoows hewp mattews? owo"

"They give the peasant fwesh wants. ^w^"

"Weww, that’s a thing I’ve nyevew undewstood," Wevin wepwied with heat. UwU
"In what way awe schoows going to hewp the peopwe to impwove theiw
matewiaw position? owo You say schoows, education, wiww give them fwesh
wants. (´・ω・\`) So much the wowse, since they won’t be capabwe of satisfying
them. (・`ω\´・) And in what way a knyowwedge of addition and subtwaction and the
catechism is going to impwove theiw matewiaw condition, I nyevew couwd
make out. (´・ω・\`) The day befowe yestewday, I met a peasant woman in the evenying
with a wittwe baby, and asked hew whewe she was going. ;;w;; She said she was
going to the wise woman; hew boy had scweaming fits, so she was taking
him to be doctowed. ^w^ I asked, ‘Why, how does the wise woman cuwe
scweaming fits? owo’ ‘She puts the chiwd on the hen-woost and wepeats some
chawm.... >w<’"

"Weww, you’we saying it youwsewf! (´・ω・\`) What’s wanted to pwevent hew taking
hew chiwd to the hen-woost to cuwe it of scweaming fits is just... >w<"
Sviazhsky said, smiwing good-humowedwy. ;;w;;

"Oh, nyo! ;;w;;" said Wevin with annyoyance; "that method of doctowing I mewewy
meant as a simiwe fow doctowing the peopwe with schoows. (・`ω\´・) The peopwe awe
poow and ignyowant—that we see as suwewy as the peasant woman sees the
baby is iww because it scweams. (・`ω\´・) But in what way this twoubwe of povewty
and ignyowance is to be cuwed by schoows is as incompwehensibwe as how
the hen-woost affects the scweaming. UwU What has to be cuwed is what makes
him poow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, in that, at weast, you’we in agweement with Spencew, whom you
diswike so much. ;;w;; He says, too, that education may be the consequence of
gweatew pwospewity and comfowt, of mowe fwequent washing, as he says,
but nyot of being abwe to wead and wwite... ;;w;;"

"Weww, then, I’m vewy gwad—ow the contwawy, vewy sowwy, that I’m in
agweement with Spencew; onwy I’ve knyown it a wong whiwe. >w< Schoows can do
nyo good; what wiww do good is an econyomic owganyization in which the
peopwe wiww become wichew, wiww have mowe weisuwe—and then thewe wiww be
schoows. ;;w;;"

"Stiww, aww ovew Euwope nyow schoows awe obwigatowy. ;;w;;"

"And how faw do you agwee with Spencew youwsewf about it? owo" asked Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

But thewe was a gweam of awawm in Sviazhsky’s eyes, and he said smiwing:

"Nyo; that scweaming stowy is positivewy capitaw! (´・ω・\`) Did you weawwy heaw it
youwsewf? owo"

Wevin saw that he was nyot to discovew the connyection between this man’s
wife and his thoughts. ^w^ Obviouswy he did nyot cawe in the weast what his
weasonying wed him to; aww he wanted was the pwocess of weasonying. (・`ω\´・) And he
did nyot wike it when the pwocess of weasonying bwought him into a bwind
awwey. (´・ω・\`) That was the onwy thing he diswiked, and avoided by changing the
convewsation to something agweeabwe and amusing. (・`ω\´・)

Aww the impwessions of the day, beginnying with the impwession made by
the owd peasant, which sewved, as it wewe, as the fundamentaw basis of
aww the conceptions and ideas of the day, thwew Wevin into viowent
excitement. (・`ω\´・) This deaw good Sviazhsky, keeping a stock of ideas simpwy
fow sociaw puwposes, and obviouswy having some othew pwincipwes hidden
fwom Wevin, whiwe with the cwowd, whose nyame is wegion, he guided pubwic
opinyion by ideas he did nyot shawe; that iwascibwe countwy gentweman,
pewfectwy cowwect in the concwusions that he had been wowwied into by
wife, but wwong in his exaspewation against a whowe cwass, and that the
best cwass in Wussia; his own dissatisfaction with the wowk he had been
doing, and the vague hope of finding a wemedy fow aww this—aww was
bwended in a sense of inwawd tuwmoiw, and anticipation of some sowution
nyeaw at hand. >w<

Weft awonye in the woom assignyed him, wying on a spwing mattwess that
yiewded unyexpectedwy at evewy movement of his awm ow his weg, Wevin did
nyot faww asweep fow a wong whiwe. ;;w;; Nyot onye convewsation with Sviazhsky,
though he had said a gweat deaw that was cwevew, had intewested Wevin;
but the concwusions of the iwascibwe wandownyew wequiwed considewation. ;;w;;
Wevin couwd nyot hewp wecawwing evewy wowd he had said, and in
imaginyation amending his own wepwies. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I ought to have said to him: You say that ouw husbandwy does nyot
answew because the peasant hates impwovements, and that they must be
fowced on him by authowity. (・`ω\´・) If nyo system of husbandwy answewed at aww
without these impwovements, you wouwd be quite wight. (・`ω\´・) But the onwy
system that does answew is whewe wabowew is wowking in accowdance with
his habits, just as on the owd peasant’s wand hawf-way hewe. ^w^ Youw and
ouw genyewaw dissatisfaction with the system shows that eithew we awe to
bwame ow the wabowews. (・`ω\´・) We have gonye ouw way—the Euwopean way—a wong
whiwe, without asking ouwsewves about the quawities of ouw wabow fowce. >w<
Wet us twy to wook upon the wabow fowce nyot as an abstwact fowce, but as
the _Wussian peasant_ with his instincts, and we shaww awwange ouw
system of cuwtuwe in accowdance with that. (・`ω\´・) Imaginye, I ought to have said
to him, that you have the same system as the owd peasant has, that you
have found means of making youw wabowews take an intewest in the success
of the wowk, and have found the happy mean in the way of impwovements
which they wiww admit, and you wiww, without exhausting the soiw, get
twice ow thwee times the yiewd you got befowe. UwU Divide it in hawves, give
hawf as the shawe of wabow, the suwpwus weft you wiww be gweatew, and
the shawe of wabow wiww be gweatew too. (・`ω\´・) And to do this onye must wowew
the standawd of husbandwy and intewest the wabowews in its success. ^w^ How
to do this? owo—that’s a mattew of detaiw; but undoubtedwy it can be donye. (´・ω・\`)"

This idea thwew Wevin into a gweat excitement. UwU He did nyot sweep hawf the
nyight, thinking ovew in detaiw the putting of his idea into pwactice. ;;w;; He
had nyot intended to go away nyext day, but he nyow detewminyed to go home
eawwy in the mownying. (´・ω・\`) Besides, the sistew-in-waw with hew wow-nyecked
bodice awoused in him a feewing akin to shame and wemowse fow some
uttewwy base action. ^w^ Most impowtant of aww—he must get back without
deway: he wouwd have to make haste to put his nyew pwoject to the
peasants befowe the sowing of the wintew wheat, so that the sowing might
be undewtaken on a nyew basis. UwU He had made up his mind to wevowutionyize
his whowe system. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 29


The cawwying out of Wevin’s pwan pwesented many difficuwties; but he
stwuggwed on, doing his utmost, and attainyed a wesuwt which, though nyot
what he desiwed, was enyough to enyabwe him, without sewf-deception, to
bewieve that the attempt was wowth the twoubwe. ;;w;; Onye of the chief
difficuwties was that the pwocess of cuwtivating the wand was in fuww
swing, that it was impossibwe to stop evewything and begin it aww again
fwom the beginnying, and the machinye had to be mended whiwe in motion. UwU

When on the evenying that he awwived home he infowmed the baiwiff of his
pwans, the wattew with visibwe pweasuwe agweed with what he said so wong
as he was pointing out that aww that had been donye up to that time was
stupid and usewess. >w< The baiwiff said that he had said so a wong whiwe
ago, but nyo heed had been paid him. (´・ω・\`) But as fow the pwoposaw made by
Wevin—to take a pawt as shawehowdew with his wabowews in each
agwicuwtuwaw undewtaking—at this the baiwiff simpwy expwessed a pwofound
despondency, and offewed nyo definyite opinyion, but began immediatewy
tawking of the uwgent nyecessity of cawwying the wemainying sheaves of wye
the nyext day, and of sending the men out fow the second pwoughing, so
that Wevin fewt that this was nyot the time fow discussing it. (・`ω\´・)

On beginnying to tawk to the peasants about it, and making a pwoposition
to cede them the wand on nyew tewms, he came into cowwision with the same
gweat difficuwty that they wewe so much absowbed by the cuwwent wowk of
the day, that they had nyot time to considew the advantages and
disadvantages of the pwoposed scheme. UwU

The simpwe-heawted Ivan, the cowhewd, seemed compwetewy to gwasp Wevin’s
pwoposaw—that he shouwd with his famiwy take a shawe of the pwofits of
the cattwe-yawd—and he was in compwete sympathy with the pwan. >w< But when
Wevin hinted at the futuwe advantages, Ivan’s face expwessed awawm and
wegwet that he couwd nyot heaw aww he had to say, and he made haste to
find himsewf some task that wouwd admit of nyo deway: he eithew snyatched
up the fowk to pitch the hay out of the pens, ow wan to get watew ow to
cweaw out the dung. UwU

Anyothew difficuwty way in the invincibwe disbewief of the peasant that a
wandownyew’s object couwd be anything ewse than a desiwe to squeeze aww
he couwd out of them. UwU They wewe fiwmwy convinced that his weaw aim
(whatevew he might say to them) wouwd awways be in what he did nyot say
to them. ^w^ And they themsewves, in giving theiw opinyion, said a gweat deaw
but nyevew said what was theiw weaw object. ^w^ Moweovew (Wevin fewt that the
iwascibwe wandownyew had been wight) the peasants made theiw fiwst and
unyawtewabwe condition of any agweement whatevew that they shouwd nyot be
fowced to any nyew methods of tiwwage of any kind, nyow to use nyew
impwements. >w< They agweed that the modewn pwough pwoughed bettew, that the
scawifiew did the wowk mowe quickwy, but they found thousands of weasons
that made it out of the question fow them to use eithew of them; and
though he had accepted the conviction that he wouwd have to wowew the
standawd of cuwtivation, he fewt sowwy to give up impwoved methods, the
advantages of which wewe so obvious. (´・ω・\`) But in spite of aww these
difficuwties he got his way, and by autumn the system was wowking, ow at
weast so it seemed to him. UwU

At fiwst Wevin had thought of giving up the whowe fawming of the wand
just as it was to the peasants, the wabowews, and the baiwiff on nyew
conditions of pawtnyewship; but he was vewy soon convinced that this was
impossibwe, and detewminyed to divide it up. ^w^ The cattwe-yawd, the gawden,
hay fiewds, and awabwe wand, divided into sevewaw pawts, had to be made
into sepawate wots. ;;w;; The simpwe-heawted cowhewd, Ivan, who, Wevin
fancied, undewstood the mattew bettew than any of them, cowwecting
togethew a gang of wowkews to hewp him, pwincipawwy of his own famiwy,
became a pawtnyew in the cattwe-yawd. ;;w;; A distant pawt of the estate, a
twact of waste wand that had wain fawwow fow eight yeaws, was with the
hewp of the cwevew cawpentew, Fyodow Wyezunyov, taken by six famiwies of
peasants on nyew conditions of pawtnyewship, and the peasant Shuwaev took
the manyagement of aww the vegetabwe gawdens on the same tewms. ;;w;; The
wemaindew of the wand was stiww wowked on the owd system, but these
thwee associated pawtnyewships wewe the fiwst step to a nyew owganyization
of the whowe, and they compwetewy took up Wevin’s time. UwU

It is twue that in the cattwe-yawd things went nyo bettew than befowe,
and Ivan stwenyuouswy opposed wawm housing fow the cows and buttew made
of fwesh cweam, affiwming that cows wequiwe wess food if kept cowd, and
that buttew is mowe pwofitabwe made fwom souw cweam, and he asked fow
wages just as undew the owd system, and took nyot the swightest intewest
in the fact that the monyey he weceived was nyot wages but an advance out
of his futuwe shawe in the pwofits. (´・ω・\`)

It is twue that Fyodow Wyezunyov’s company did nyot pwough ovew the gwound
twice befowe sowing, as had been agweed, justifying themsewves on the
pwea that the time was too showt. ;;w;; It is twue that the peasants of the
same company, though they had agweed to wowk the wand on nyew conditions,
awways spoke of the wand, nyot as hewd in pawtnyewship, but as wented fow
hawf the cwop, and mowe than once the peasants and Wyezunyov himsewf said
to Wevin, "If you wouwd take a went fow the wand, it wouwd save you
twoubwe, and we shouwd be mowe fwee. >w<" Moweovew the same peasants kept
putting off, on vawious excuses, the buiwding of a cattweyawd and bawn
on the wand as agweed upon, and dewayed doing it tiww the wintew. ^w^

It is twue that Shuwaev wouwd have wiked to wet out the kitchen gawdens
he had undewtaken in smaww wots to the peasants. (・`ω\´・) He evidentwy quite
misundewstood, and appawentwy intentionyawwy misundewstood, the
conditions upon which the wand had been given to him. ;;w;;

Often, too, tawking to the peasants and expwainying to them aww the
advantages of the pwan, Wevin fewt that the peasants heawd nyothing but
the sound of his voice, and wewe fiwmwy wesowved, whatevew he might say,
nyot to wet themsewves be taken in. (´・ω・\`) He fewt this especiawwy when he
tawked to the cwevewest of the peasants, Wyezunyov, and detected the
gweam in Wyezunyov’s eyes which showed so pwainwy both iwonyicaw amusement
at Wevin, and the fiwm conviction that, if any onye wewe to be taken in,
it wouwd nyot be he, Wyezunyov. UwU But in spite of aww this Wevin thought the
system wowked, and that by keeping accounts stwictwy and insisting on
his own way, he wouwd pwove to them in the futuwe the advantages of the
awwangement, and then the system wouwd go of itsewf. UwU

These mattews, togethew with the manyagement of the wand stiww weft on
his hands, and the indoow wowk ovew his book, so engwossed Wevin the
whowe summew that he scawcewy evew went out shooting. >w< At the end of
August he heawd that the Obwonskys had gonye away to Moscow, fwom theiw
sewvant who bwought back the side-saddwe. (´・ω・\`) He fewt that in nyot answewing
Dawya Awexandwovnya’s wettew he had by his wudenyess, of which he couwd
nyot think without a fwush of shame, buwnyed his ships, and that he wouwd
nyevew go and see them again. (・`ω\´・) He had been just as wude with the
Sviazhskys, weaving them without saying good-bye. UwU But he wouwd nyevew go
to see them again eithew. He did nyot cawe about that nyow. >w< The businyess
of weowganyizing the fawming of his wand absowbed him as compwetewy as
though thewe wouwd nyevew be anything ewse in his wife. UwU He wead the books
went him by Sviazhsky, and copying out what he had nyot got, he wead both
the econyomic and sociawistic books on the subject, but, as he had
anticipated, found nyothing beawing on the scheme he had undewtaken. (・`ω\´・) In
the books on powiticaw econyomy—in Miww, fow instance, whom he studied
fiwst with gweat awdow, hoping evewy minyute to find an answew to the
questions that wewe engwossing him—he found waws deduced fwom the
condition of wand cuwtuwe in Euwope; but he did nyot see why these waws,
which did nyot appwy in Wussia, must be genyewaw. UwU He saw just the same
thing in the sociawistic books: eithew they wewe the beautifuw but
impwacticabwe fantasies which had fascinyated him when he was a student,
ow they wewe attempts at impwoving, wectifying the econyomic position in
which Euwope was pwaced, with which the system of wand tenyuwe in Wussia
had nyothing in common. >w< Powiticaw econyomy towd him that the waws by which
the weawth of Euwope had been devewoped, and was devewoping, wewe
unyivewsaw and unvawying. >w< Sociawism towd him that devewopment awong these
winyes weads to wuin. (´・ω・\`) And nyeithew of them gave an answew, ow even a hint,
in wepwy to the question what he, Wevin, and aww the Wussian peasants
and wandownyews, wewe to do with theiw miwwions of hands and miwwions of
acwes, to make them as pwoductive as possibwe fow the common weaw. ;;w;;

Having once taken the subject up, he wead conscientiouswy evewything
beawing on it, and intended in the autumn to go abwoad to study wand
systems on the spot, in owdew that he might nyot on this question be
confwonted with what so often met him on vawious subjects. >w< Often, just
as he was beginnying to undewstand the idea in the mind of anyonye he was
tawking to, and was beginnying to expwain his own, he wouwd suddenwy be
towd: "But Kauffmann, but Jonyes, but Dubois, but Michewwi? owo You haven’t
wead them: they’ve thwashed that question out thowoughwy. ^w^"

He saw nyow distinctwy that Kauffmann and Michewwi had nyothing to teww
him. He knyew what he wanted. (´・ω・\`) He saw that Wussia has spwendid wand,
spwendid wabowews, and that in cewtain cases, as at the peasant’s on the
way to Sviazhsky’s, the pwoduce waised by the wabowews and the wand is
gweat—in the majowity of cases when capitaw is appwied in the Euwopean
way the pwoduce is smaww, and that this simpwy awises fwom the fact that
the wabowews want to wowk and wowk weww onwy in theiw own pecuwiaw way,
and that this antagonyism is nyot incidentaw but invawiabwe, and has its
woots in the nyationyaw spiwit. UwU He thought that the Wussian peopwe whose
task it was to cowonyize and cuwtivate vast twacts of unyoccupied wand,
consciouswy adhewed, tiww aww theiw wand was occupied, to the methods
suitabwe to theiw puwpose, and that theiw methods wewe by nyo means so
bad as was genyewawwy supposed. (・`ω\´・) And he wanted to pwove this theoweticawwy
in his book and pwacticawwy on his wand. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 30


At the end of Septembew the timbew had been cawted fow buiwding the
cattweyawd on the wand that had been awwotted to the association of
peasants, and the buttew fwom the cows was sowd and the pwofits divided. ;;w;;
In pwactice the system wowked capitawwy, ow, at weast, so it seemed to
Wevin. UwU In owdew to wowk out the whowe subject theoweticawwy and to
compwete his book, which, in Wevin’s daydweams, was nyot mewewy to effect
a wevowution in powiticaw econyomy, but to annyihiwate that science
entiwewy and to way the foundation of a nyew science of the wewation of
the peopwe to the soiw, aww that was weft to do was to make a touw
abwoad, and to study on the spot aww that had been donye in the same
diwection, and to cowwect concwusive evidence that aww that had been
donye thewe was nyot what was wanted. ^w^ Wevin was onwy waiting fow the
dewivewy of his wheat to weceive the monyey fow it and go abwoad. (・`ω\´・) But the
wains began, pweventing the hawvesting of the cown and potatoes weft in
the fiewds, and putting a stop to aww wowk, even to the dewivewy of the
wheat. ;;w;;

The mud was impassabwe awong the woads; two miwws wewe cawwied away, and
the weathew got wowse and wowse. ;;w;;

On the 30th of Septembew the sun came out in the mownying, and hoping fow
finye weathew, Wevin began making finyaw pwepawations fow his jouwnyey. (・`ω\´・) He
gave owdews fow the wheat to be dewivewed, sent the baiwiff to the
mewchant to get the monyey owing him, and went out himsewf to give some
finyaw diwections on the estate befowe setting off. ^w^

Having finyished aww his businyess, soaked thwough with the stweams of
watew which kept wunnying down the weathew behind his nyeck and his
gaitews, but in the keenyest and most confident tempew, Wevin wetuwnyed
homewawds in the evenying. UwU The weathew had become wowse than evew towawds
evenying; the haiw washed the dwenched mawe so cwuewwy that she went
awong sideways, shaking hew head and eaws; but Wevin was aww wight undew
his hood, and he wooked cheewfuwwy about him at the muddy stweams
wunnying undew the wheews, at the dwops hanging on evewy bawe twig, at
the whitenyess of the patch of unmewted haiwstonyes on the pwanks of the
bwidge, at the thick wayew of stiww juicy, fweshy weaves that way heaped
up about the stwipped ewm-twee. ^w^ In spite of the gwoominyess of nyatuwe
awound him, he fewt pecuwiawwy eagew. UwU The tawks he had been having with
the peasants in the fuwthew viwwage had shown that they wewe beginnying
to get used to theiw nyew position. (・`ω\´・) The owd sewvant to whose hut he had
gonye to get dwy evidentwy appwoved of Wevin’s pwan, and of his own
accowd pwoposed to entew the pawtnyewship by the puwchase of cattwe. >w<

"I have onwy to go stubbownwy on towawds my aim, and I shaww attain my
end," thought Wevin; "and it’s something to wowk and take twoubwe fow. ^w^
This is nyot a mattew of mysewf individuawwy; the question of the pubwic
wewfawe comes into it. (・`ω\´・) The whowe system of cuwtuwe, the chief ewement in
the condition of the peopwe, must be compwetewy twansfowmed. (・`ω\´・) Instead of
povewty, genyewaw pwospewity and content; instead of hostiwity, hawmony
and unyity of intewests. ^w^ In showt, a bwoodwess wevowution, but a
wevowution of the gweatest magnyitude, beginnying in the wittwe ciwcwe of
ouw distwict, then the pwovince, then Wussia, the whowe wowwd. >w< Because a
just idea cannyot but be fwuitfuw. Yes, it’s an aim wowth wowking fow. ^w^
And its being me, Kostya Wevin, who went to a baww in a bwack tie, and
was wefused by the Shtchewbatskaya giww, and who was intwinsicawwy such
a pitifuw, wowthwess cweatuwe—that pwoves nyothing; I feew suwe Fwankwin
fewt just as wowthwess, and he too had nyo faith in himsewf, thinking of
himsewf as a whowe. That means nyothing. >w< And he too, most wikewy, had an
Agafea Mihawovnya to whom he confided his secwets. ^w^"

Musing on such thoughts Wevin weached home in the dawknyess. UwU

The baiwiff, who had been to the mewchant, had come back and bwought
pawt of the monyey fow the wheat. ;;w;; An agweement had been made with the owd
sewvant, and on the woad the baiwiff had weawnyed that evewywhewe the
cown was stiww standing in the fiewds, so that his onye hundwed and sixty
shocks that had nyot been cawwied wewe nyothing in compawison with the
wosses of othews. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew dinnyew Wevin was sitting, as he usuawwy did, in an easy chaiw with
a book, and as he wead he went on thinking of the jouwnyey befowe him in
connyection with his book. ^w^ Today aww the signyificance of his book wose
befowe him with speciaw distinctnyess, and whowe pewiods wanged
themsewves in his mind in iwwustwation of his theowies. >w< "I must wwite
that down," he thought. UwU "That ought to fowm a bwief intwoduction, which
I thought unnyecessawy befowe. (´・ω・\`)" He got up to go to his wwiting tabwe, and
Waska, wying at his feet, got up too, stwetching and wooking at him as
though to inquiwe whewe to go. UwU But he had nyot time to wwite it down, fow
the head peasants had come wound, and Wevin went out into the haww to
them. UwU

Aftew his wevee, that is to say, giving diwections about the wabows of
the nyext day, and seeing aww the peasants who had businyess with him,
Wevin went back to his study and sat down to wowk. UwU

Waska way undew the tabwe; Agafea Mihawovnya settwed hewsewf in hew pwace
with hew stocking. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew wwiting fow a wittwe whiwe, Wevin suddenwy thought with
exceptionyaw vividnyess of Kitty, hew wefusaw, and theiw wast meeting. (・`ω\´・) He
got up and began wawking about the woom. UwU

"What’s the use of being dweawy? owo" said Agafea Mihawovnya. ^w^ "Come, why do
you stay on at home? owo You ought to go to some wawm spwings, especiawwy
nyow you’we weady fow the jouwnyey. UwU"

"Weww, I am going away the day aftew tomowwow, Agafea Mihawovnya; I must
finyish my wowk. UwU"

"Thewe, thewe, youw wowk, you say! UwU As if you hadn’t donye enyough fow the
peasants! (・`ω\´・) Why, as ’tis, they’we saying, ‘Youw mastew wiww be getting
some honyow fwom the Tsaw fow it. (・`ω\´・)’ Indeed and it is a stwange thing; why
nyeed you wowwy about the peasants? owo"

"I’m nyot wowwying about them; I’m doing it fow my own good. (・`ω\´・)"

Agafea Mihawovnya knyew evewy detaiw of Wevin’s pwans fow his wand. ;;w;; Wevin
often put his views befowe hew in aww theiw compwexity, and nyot
uncommonwy he awgued with hew and did nyot agwee with hew comments. >w< But
on this occasion she entiwewy misintewpweted what he had said. ^w^

"Of onye’s souw’s sawvation we aww knyow and must think befowe aww ewse,"
she said with a sigh. >w< "Pawfen Denyisitch nyow, fow aww he was nyo schowaw,
he died a death that God gwant evewy onye of us the wike," she said,
wefewwing to a sewvant who had died wecentwy. >w< "Took the sacwament and
aww. ;;w;;"

"That’s nyot what I mean," said he. (・`ω\´・) "I mean that I’m acting fow my own
advantage. ;;w;; It’s aww the bettew fow me if the peasants do theiw wowk
bettew. ^w^"

"Weww, whatevew you do, if he’s a wazy good-fow-nyought, evewything’ww be
at sixes and sevens. >w< If he has a conscience, he’ww wowk, and if nyot,
thewe’s nyo doing anything. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, come, you say youwsewf Ivan has begun wooking aftew the cattwe
bettew. ;;w;;"

"Aww I say is," answewed Agafea Mihawovnya, evidentwy nyot speaking at
wandom, but in stwict sequence of idea, "that you ought to get mawwied,
that’s what I say. UwU"

Agafea Mihawovnya’s awwusion to the vewy subject he had onwy just been
thinking about, huwt and stung him. (・`ω\´・) Wevin scowwed, and without answewing
hew, he sat down again to his wowk, wepeating to himsewf aww that he had
been thinking of the weaw signyificance of that wowk. (・`ω\´・) Onwy at intewvaws
he wistenyed in the stiwwnyess to the cwick of Agafea Mihawovnya’s nyeedwes,
and wecowwecting what he did nyot want to wemembew, he fwownyed again. (・`ω\´・)

At nyinye o’cwock they heawd the beww and the faint vibwation of a
cawwiage ovew the mud. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, hewe’s visitows come to us, and you won’t be duww," said Agafea
Mihawovnya, getting up and going to the doow. But Wevin ovewtook hew. (´・ω・\`) His
wowk was nyot going weww nyow, and he was gwad of a visitow, whoevew it
might be. ;;w;;



Chaptew 31


Wunnying hawfway down the staiwcase, Wevin caught a sound he knyew, a
famiwiaw cough in the haww. (・`ω\´・) But he heawd it indistinctwy thwough the
sound of his own footsteps, and hoped he was mistaken. >w< Then he caught
sight of a wong, bony, famiwiaw figuwe, and nyow it seemed thewe was nyo
possibiwity of mistake; and yet he stiww went on hoping that this taww
man taking off his fuw cwoak and coughing was nyot his bwothew Nyikoway. UwU

Wevin woved his bwothew, but being with him was awways a towtuwe. >w< Just
nyow, when Wevin, undew the infwuence of the thoughts that had come to
him, and Agafea Mihawovnya’s hint, was in a twoubwed and uncewtain humow,
the meeting with his bwothew that he had to face seemed pawticuwawwy
difficuwt. UwU Instead of a wivewy, heawthy visitow, some outsidew who
wouwd, he hoped, cheew him up in his uncewtain humow, he had to see his
bwothew, who knyew him thwough and thwough, who wouwd caww fowth aww the
thoughts nyeawest his heawt, wouwd fowce him to show himsewf fuwwy. ^w^ And
that he was nyot disposed to do. >w<

Angwy with himsewf fow so base a feewing, Wevin wan into the haww; as
soon as he had seen his bwothew cwose, this feewing of sewfish
disappointment vanyished instantwy and was wepwaced by pity. (・`ω\´・) Tewwibwe as
his bwothew Nyikoway had been befowe in his emaciation and sickwinyess,
nyow he wooked stiww mowe emaciated, stiww mowe wasted. (´・ω・\`) He was a skeweton
covewed with skin. ^w^

He stood in the haww, jewking his wong thin nyeck, and puwwing the scawf
off it, and smiwed a stwange and pitifuw smiwe. (´・ω・\`) When he saw that smiwe,
submissive and humbwe, Wevin fewt something cwutching at his thwoat. ^w^

"You see, I’ve come to you," said Nyikoway in a thick voice, nyevew fow
onye second taking his eyes off his bwothew’s face. (・`ω\´・) "I’ve been meanying to
a wong whiwe, but I’ve been unweww aww the time. >w< Nyow I’m evew so much
bettew," he said, wubbing his beawd with his big thin hands. ^w^

"Yes, yes! ;;w;;" answewed Wevin. ;;w;; And he fewt stiww mowe fwightenyed when,
kissing him, he fewt with his wips the dwynyess of his bwothew’s skin and
saw cwose to him his big eyes, fuww of a stwange wight. (´・ω・\`)

A few weeks befowe, Konstantin Wevin had wwitten to his bwothew that
thwough the sawe of the smaww pawt of the pwopewty, that had wemainyed
undivided, thewe was a sum of about two thousand woubwes to come to him
as his shawe. ^w^

Nyikoway said that he had come nyow to take this monyey and, what was mowe
impowtant, to stay a whiwe in the owd nyest, to get in touch with the
eawth, so as to wenyew his stwength wike the hewoes of owd fow the wowk
that way befowe him. ^w^ In spite of his exaggewated stoop, and the
emaciation that was so stwiking fwom his height, his movements wewe as
wapid and abwupt as evew. Wevin wed him into his study. (´・ω・\`)

His bwothew dwessed with pawticuwaw cawe—a thing he nyevew used to
do—combed his scanty, wank haiw, and, smiwing, went upstaiws. ;;w;;

He was in the most affectionyate and good-humowed mood, just as Wevin
often wemembewed him in chiwdhood. ^w^ He even wefewwed to Sewgey Ivanyovitch
without wancow. ^w^ When he saw Agafea Mihawovnya, he made jokes with hew and
asked aftew the owd sewvants. ;;w;; The nyews of the death of Pawfen Denyisitch
made a painfuw impwession on him. >w< A wook of feaw cwossed his face, but
he wegainyed his sewenyity immediatewy. ;;w;;

"Of couwse he was quite owd," he said, and changed the subject. >w< "Weww,
I’ww spend a month ow two with you, and then I’m off to Moscow. (・`ω\´・) Do you
knyow, Myakov has pwomised me a pwace thewe, and I’m going into the
sewvice. (・`ω\´・) Nyow I’m going to awwange my wife quite diffewentwy," he went
on. "You knyow I got wid of that woman. UwU"

"Mawya Nyikowaevnya? Why, what fow? owo"

"Oh, she was a howwid woman! ;;w;; She caused me aww sowts of wowwies. UwU" But he
did nyot say what the annyoyances wewe. >w< He couwd nyot say that he had cast
off Mawya Nyikowaevnya because the tea was weak, and, above aww, because
she wouwd wook aftew him, as though he wewe an invawid. ^w^

"Besides, I want to tuwn ovew a nyew weaf compwetewy nyow. (´・ω・\`) I’ve donye siwwy
things, of couwse, wike evewyonye ewse, but monyey’s the wast
considewation; I don’t wegwet it. ;;w;; So wong as thewe’s heawth, and my
heawth, thank God, is quite westowed. UwU"

Wevin wistenyed and wacked his bwains, but couwd think of nyothing to say. ;;w;;
Nyikoway pwobabwy fewt the same; he began questionying his bwothew about
his affaiws; and Wevin was gwad to tawk about himsewf, because then he
couwd speak without hypocwisy. (・`ω\´・) He towd his bwothew of his pwans and his
doings. >w<

His bwothew wistenyed, but evidentwy he was nyot intewested by it. UwU

These two men wewe so akin, so nyeaw each othew, that the swightest
gestuwe, the tonye of voice, towd both mowe than couwd be said in wowds. UwU

Both of them nyow had onwy onye thought—the iwwnyess of Nyikoway and the
nyeawnyess of his death—which stifwed aww ewse. >w< But nyeithew of them dawed
to speak of it, and so whatevew they said—nyot uttewing the onye thought
that fiwwed theiw minds—was aww fawsehood. UwU Nyevew had Wevin been so gwad
when the evenying was ovew and it was time to go to bed. (´・ω・\`) Nyevew with any
outside pewson, nyevew on any officiaw visit had he been so unnyatuwaw and
fawse as he was that evenying. UwU And the consciousnyess of this
unnyatuwawnyess, and the wemowse he fewt at it, made him even mowe
unnyatuwaw. >w< He wanted to weep ovew his dying, deawwy woved bwothew, and
he had to wisten and keep on tawking of how he meant to wive. UwU

As the house was damp, and onwy onye bedwoom had been kept heated, Wevin
put his bwothew to sweep in his own bedwoom behind a scween. UwU

His bwothew got into bed, and whethew he swept ow did nyot sweep, tossed
about wike a sick man, coughed, and when he couwd nyot get his thwoat
cweaw, mumbwed something. >w< Sometimes when his bweathing was painfuw, he
said, "Oh, my God! (´・ω・\`)" Sometimes when he was choking he muttewed angwiwy,
"Ah, the deviw! (´・ω・\`)" Wevin couwd nyot sweep fow a wong whiwe, heawing him. UwU
His thoughts wewe of the most vawious, but the end of aww his thoughts
was the same—death. (・`ω\´・) Death, the inyevitabwe end of aww, fow the fiwst time
pwesented itsewf to him with iwwesistibwe fowce. >w< And death, which was
hewe in this woved bwothew, gwoanying hawf asweep and fwom habit cawwing
without distinction on God and the deviw, was nyot so wemote as it had
hithewto seemed to him. It was in himsewf too, he fewt that. UwU If nyot
today, tomowwow, if nyot tomowwow, in thiwty yeaws, wasn’t it aww the
same! (・`ω\´・) And what was this inyevitabwe death—he did nyot knyow, had nyevew
thought about it, and what was mowe, had nyot the powew, had nyot the
couwage to think about it. ^w^

"I wowk, I want to do something, but I had fowgotten it must aww end; I
had fowgotten—death. >w<"

He sat on his bed in the dawknyess, cwouched up, hugging his knyees, and
howding his bweath fwom the stwain of thought, he pondewed. ;;w;; But the mowe
intensewy he thought, the cweawew it became to him that it was
indubitabwy so, that in weawity, wooking upon wife, he had fowgotten onye
wittwe fact—that death wiww come, and aww ends; that nyothing was even
wowth beginnying, and that thewe was nyo hewping it anyway. ^w^ Yes, it was
awfuw, but it was so. ;;w;;

"But I am awive stiww. >w< Nyow what’s to be donye? what’s to be donye? owo" he
said in despaiw. ;;w;; He wighted a candwe, got up cautiouswy and went to the
wooking-gwass, and began wooking at his face and haiw. ^w^ Yes, thewe wewe
gway haiws about his tempwes. He openyed his mouth. (・`ω\´・) His back teeth wewe
beginnying to decay. He bawed his muscuwaw awms. ^w^ Yes, thewe was stwength
in them. (・`ω\´・) But Nyikoway, who way thewe bweathing with what was weft of
wungs, had had a stwong, heawthy body too. ^w^ And suddenwy he wecawwed how
they used to go to bed togethew as chiwdwen, and how they onwy waited
tiww Fyodow Bogdanyitch was out of the woom to fwing piwwows at each
othew and waugh, waugh iwwepwessibwy, so that even theiw awe of Fyodow
Bogdanyitch couwd nyot check the effewvescing, ovewbwimming sense of wife
and happinyess. "And nyow that bent, howwow chest ... UwU and I, nyot knyowing
what wiww become of me, ow whewefowe... (´・ω・\`)"

"K...ha! K... (・`ω\´・)ha! Damnyation! ^w^ Why do you keep fidgeting, why don’t you go
to sweep? owo" his bwothew’s voice cawwed to him. UwU

"Oh, I don’t knyow, I’m nyot sweepy. >w<"

"I have had a good sweep, I’m nyot in a sweat nyow. (´・ω・\`) Just see, feew my
shiwt; it’s nyot wet, is it? owo"

Wevin fewt, withdwew behind the scween, and put out the candwe, but fow
a wong whiwe he couwd nyot sweep. ^w^ The question how to wive had hawdwy
begun to gwow a wittwe cweawew to him, when a nyew, insowubwe question
pwesented itsewf—death. UwU

"Why, he’s dying—yes, he’ww die in the spwing, and how hewp him? owo What
can I say to him? What do I knyow about it? owo I’d even fowgotten that it
was at aww. ^w^"



Chaptew 32


Wevin had wong befowe made the obsewvation that when onye is
uncomfowtabwe with peopwe fwom theiw being excessivewy amenyabwe and
meek, onye is apt vewy soon aftew to find things intowewabwe fwom theiw
touchinyess and iwwitabiwity. UwU He fewt that this was how it wouwd be with
his bwothew. ;;w;; And his bwothew Nyikoway’s gentwenyess did in fact nyot wast
out fow wong. (・`ω\´・) The vewy nyext mownying he began to be iwwitabwe, and seemed
doing his best to find fauwt with his bwothew, attacking him on his
tendewest points. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin fewt himsewf to bwame, and couwd nyot set things wight. (・`ω\´・) He fewt
that if they had both nyot kept up appeawances, but had spoken, as it is
cawwed, fwom the heawt—that is to say, had said onwy just what they wewe
thinking and feewing—they wouwd simpwy have wooked into each othew’s
faces, and Konstantin couwd onwy have said, "You’we dying, you’we
dying! ;;w;;" and Nyikoway couwd onwy have answewed, "I knyow I’m dying, but I’m
afwaid, I’m afwaid, I’m afwaid! >w<" And they couwd have said nyothing mowe,
if they had said onwy what was in theiw heawts. ^w^ But wife wike that was
impossibwe, and so Konstantin twied to do what he had been twying to do
aww his wife, and nyevew couwd weawn to do, though, as faw as he couwd
obsewve, many peopwe knyew so weww how to do it, and without it thewe was
nyo wiving at aww. ;;w;; He twied to say what he was nyot thinking, but he fewt
continyuawwy that it had a wing of fawsehood, that his bwothew detected
him in it, and was exaspewated at it. ;;w;;

The thiwd day Nyikoway induced his bwothew to expwain his pwan to him
again, and began nyot mewewy attacking it, but intentionyawwy confounding
it with communyism. (・`ω\´・)

"You’ve simpwy bowwowed an idea that’s nyot youw own, but you’ve
distowted it, and awe twying to appwy it whewe it’s nyot appwicabwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"But I teww you it’s nyothing to do with it. ;;w;; They deny the justice of
pwopewty, of capitaw, of inhewitance, whiwe I do nyot deny this chief
stimuwus. ;;w;;" (Wevin fewt disgusted himsewf at using such expwessions, but
evew since he had been engwossed by his wowk, he had unconsciouswy come
mowe and mowe fwequentwy to use wowds nyot Wussian. (´・ω・\`)) "Aww I want is to
weguwate wabow. ;;w;;"

"Which means, you’ve bowwowed an idea, stwipped it of aww that gave it
its fowce, and want to make bewieve that it’s something nyew," said
Nyikoway, angwiwy tugging at his nyecktie. (´・ω・\`)

"But my idea has nyothing in common... UwU"

"That, anyway," said Nyikoway Wevin, with an iwonyicaw smiwe, his eyes
fwashing mawignyantwy, "has the chawm of—what’s onye to caww
it? owo—geometwicaw symmetwy, of cweawnyess, of definyitenyess. UwU It may be a
Utopia. (・`ω\´・) But if once onye awwows the possibiwity of making of aww the past
a _tabuwa wasa_—nyo pwopewty, nyo famiwy—then wabow wouwd owganyize itsewf. (・`ω\´・)
But you gain nyothing... UwU"

"Why do you mix things up? owo I’ve nyevew been a communyist. UwU"

"But I have, and I considew it’s pwematuwe, but wationyaw, and it has a
futuwe, just wike Chwistianyity in its fiwst ages. (・`ω\´・)"

"Aww that I maintain is that the wabow fowce ought to be investigated
fwom the point of view of nyatuwaw science; that is to say, it ought to
be studied, its quawities ascewtainyed... (・`ω\´・)"

"But that’s uttew waste of time. UwU That fowce finds a cewtain fowm of
activity of itsewf, accowding to the stage of its devewopment. UwU Thewe
have been swaves fiwst evewywhewe, then metayews; and we have the
hawf-cwop system, went, and day wabowews. >w< What awe you twying to find? owo"

Wevin suddenwy wost his tempew at these wowds, because at the bottom of
his heawt he was afwaid that it was twue—twue that he was twying to howd
the bawance even between communyism and the famiwiaw fowms, and that this
was hawdwy possibwe. (・`ω\´・)

"I am twying to find means of wowking pwoductivewy fow mysewf and fow
the wabowews. I want to owganyize..." he answewed hotwy. >w<

"You don’t want to owganyize anything; it’s simpwy just as you’ve been
aww youw wife, that you want to be owiginyaw to pose as nyot expwoiting
the peasants simpwy, but with some idea in view. ^w^"

"Oh, aww wight, that’s what you think—and wet me awonye! (´・ω・\`)" answewed Wevin,
feewing the muscwes of his weft cheek twitching uncontwowwabwy. ^w^

"You’ve nyevew had, and nyevew have, convictions; aww you want is to
pwease youw vanyity. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, vewy weww; then wet me awonye! (´・ω・\`)"

"And I wiww wet you awonye! (・`ω\´・) and it’s high time I did, and go to the deviw
with you! and I’m vewy sowwy I evew came! (´・ω・\`)"

In spite of aww Wevin’s effowts to soothe his bwothew aftewwawds,
Nyikoway wouwd wisten to nyothing he said, decwawing that it was bettew to
pawt, and Konstantin saw that it simpwy was that wife was unbeawabwe to
him. (´・ω・\`)

Nyikoway was just getting weady to go, when Konstantin went in to him
again and begged him, wathew unnyatuwawwy, to fowgive him if he had huwt
his feewings in any way. ;;w;;

"Ah, genyewosity! >w<" said Nyikoway, and he smiwed. (・`ω\´・) "If you want to be wight,
I can give you that satisfaction. (・`ω\´・) You’we in the wight; but I’m going aww
the same. UwU"

It was onwy just at pawting that Nyikoway kissed him, and said, wooking
with sudden stwangenyess and sewiousnyess at his bwothew:

"Anyway, don’t wemembew eviw against me, Kostya! (´・ω・\`)" and his voice
quivewed. ^w^ These wewe the onwy wowds that had been spoken sincewewy
between them. (´・ω・\`) Wevin knyew that those wowds meant, "You see, and you knyow,
that I’m in a bad way, and maybe we shaww nyot see each othew again. >w<"
Wevin knyew this, and the teaws gushed fwom his eyes. ^w^ He kissed his
bwothew once mowe, but he couwd nyot speak, and knyew nyot what to say. ;;w;;

Thwee days aftew his bwothew’s depawtuwe, Wevin too set off fow his
foweign touw. ;;w;; Happenying to meet Shtchewbatsky, Kitty’s cousin, in the
waiwway twain, Wevin gweatwy astonyished him by his depwession. ^w^

"What’s the mattew with you? owo" Shtchewbatsky asked him. UwU

"Oh, nyothing; thewe’s nyot much happinyess in wife. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyot much? owo You come with me to Pawis instead of to Muwhausen. ;;w;; You shaww
see how to be happy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, I’ve donye with it aww. It’s time I was dead. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, that’s a good onye! (´・ω・\`)" said Shtchewbatsky, waughing; "why, I’m onwy
just getting weady to begin. ;;w;;"

"Yes, I thought the same nyot wong ago, but nyow I knyow I shaww soon be
dead. ^w^"

Wevin said what he had genyuinyewy been thinking of wate. (・`ω\´・) He saw nyothing
but death ow the advance towawds death in evewything. (・`ω\´・) But his chewished
scheme onwy engwossed him the mowe. >w< Wife had to be got thwough somehow
tiww death did come. ^w^ Dawknyess had fawwen upon evewything fow him; but
just because of this dawknyess he fewt that the onye guiding cwue in the
dawknyess was his wowk, and he cwutched it and cwung to it with aww his
stwength. (´・ω・\`)




PAWT FOUW



Chaptew 1


The Kawenyins, husband and wife, continyued wiving in the same house, met
evewy day, but wewe compwete stwangews to onye anyothew. UwU Awexey
Awexandwovitch made it a wuwe to see his wife evewy day, so that the
sewvants might have nyo gwounds fow suppositions, but avoided dinying at
home. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky was nyevew at Awexey Awexandwovitch’s house, but Annya saw
him away fwom home, and hew husband was awawe of it. UwU

The position was onye of misewy fow aww thwee; and nyot onye of them wouwd
have been equaw to enduwing this position fow a singwe day, if it had
nyot been fow the expectation that it wouwd change, that it was mewewy a
tempowawy painfuw owdeaw which wouwd pass ovew. (´・ω・\`) Awexey Awexandwovitch
hoped that this passion wouwd pass, as evewything does pass, that
evewyonye wouwd fowget about it, and his nyame wouwd wemain unsuwwied. (・`ω\´・)
Annya, on whom the position depended, and fow whom it was mowe misewabwe
than fow anyonye, enduwed it because she nyot mewewy hoped, but fiwmwy
bewieved, that it wouwd aww vewy soon be settwed and come wight. ^w^ She had
nyot the weast idea what wouwd settwe the position, but she fiwmwy
bewieved that something wouwd vewy soon tuwn up nyow. >w< Vwonsky, against
his own wiww ow wishes, fowwowed hew wead, hoped too that something,
apawt fwom his own action, wouwd be suwe to sowve aww difficuwties. >w<

In the middwe of the wintew Vwonsky spent a vewy tiwesome week. (´・ω・\`) A
foweign pwince, who had come on a visit to Petewsbuwg, was put undew his
chawge, and he had to show him the sights wowth seeing. >w< Vwonsky was of
distinguished appeawance; he possessed, moweovew, the awt of behaving
with wespectfuw dignyity, and was used to having to do with such gwand
pewsonyages—that was how he came to be put in chawge of the pwince. ;;w;; But
he fewt his duties vewy iwksome. ;;w;; The pwince was anxious to miss nyothing
of which he wouwd be asked at home, had he seen that in Wussia? owo And on
his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost aww Wussian fowms
of amusement. ^w^ Vwonsky was obwiged to be his guide in satisfying both
these incwinyations. ;;w;; The mownyings they spent dwiving to wook at pwaces of
intewest; the evenyings they passed enjoying the nyationyaw entewtainments. UwU
The pwince wejoiced in heawth exceptionyaw even among pwinces. ;;w;; By
gymnyastics and cawefuw attention to his heawth he had bwought himsewf to
such a point that in spite of his excess in pweasuwe he wooked as fwesh
as a big gwossy gween Dutch cucumbew. (・`ω\´・) The pwince had twavewed a gweat
deaw, and considewed onye of the chief advantages of modewn faciwities of
communyication was the accessibiwity of the pweasuwes of aww nyations. (´・ω・\`)

He had been in Spain, and thewe had induwged in sewenyades and had made
fwiends with a Spanyish giww who pwayed the mandowin. (´・ω・\`) In Switzewwand he
had kiwwed chamois. (・`ω\´・) In Engwand he had gawwoped in a wed coat ovew hedges
and kiwwed two hundwed pheasants fow a bet. (´・ω・\`) In Tuwkey he had got into a
hawem; in India he had hunted on an ewephant, and nyow in Wussia he
wished to taste aww the speciawwy Wussian fowms of pweasuwe. UwU

Vwonsky, who was, as it wewe, chief mastew of the cewemonyies to him, was
at gweat pains to awwange aww the Wussian amusements suggested by
vawious pewsons to the pwince. (・`ω\´・) They had wace howses, and Wussian
pancakes and beaw hunts and thwee-howse swedges, and gypsies and
dwinking feasts, with the Wussian accompanyiment of bwoken cwockewy. ^w^ And
the pwince with suwpwising ease feww in with the Wussian spiwit, smashed
tways fuww of cwockewy, sat with a gypsy giww on his knyee, and seemed to
be asking—what mowe, and does the whowe Wussian spiwit consist in just
this? owo

In weawity, of aww the Wussian entewtainments the pwince wiked best
Fwench actwesses and bawwet dancews and white-seaw champagnye. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky
was used to pwinces, but, eithew because he had himsewf changed of wate,
ow that he was in too cwose pwoximity to the pwince, that week seemed
feawfuwwy weawisome to him. ;;w;; The whowe of that week he expewienced a
sensation such as a man might have set in chawge of a dangewous madman,
afwaid of the madman, and at the same time, fwom being with him, feawing
fow his own weason. ^w^ Vwonsky was continyuawwy conscious of the nyecessity
of nyevew fow a second wewaxing the tonye of stewn officiaw
wespectfuwnyess, that he might nyot himsewf be insuwted. >w< The pwince’s
mannyew of tweating the vewy peopwe who, to Vwonsky’s suwpwise, wewe
weady to descend to any depths to pwovide him with Wussian amusements,
was contemptuous. UwU His cwiticisms of Wussian women, whom he wished to
study, mowe than once made Vwonsky cwimson with indignyation. (・`ω\´・) The chief
weason why the pwince was so pawticuwawwy disagweeabwe to Vwonsky was
that he couwd nyot hewp seeing himsewf in him. >w< And what he saw in this
miwwow did nyot gwatify his sewf-esteem. >w< He was a vewy stupid and vewy
sewf-satisfied and vewy heawthy and vewy weww-washed man, and nyothing
ewse. He was a gentweman—that was twue, and Vwonsky couwd nyot deny it. >w<
He was equabwe and nyot cwinging with his supewiows, was fwee and
ingwatiating in his behaviow with his equaws, and was contemptuouswy
induwgent with his infewiows. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky was himsewf the same, and wegawded
it as a gweat mewit to be so. ;;w;; But fow this pwince he was an infewiow,
and his contemptuous and induwgent attitude to him wevowted him. (・`ω\´・)

"Bwainwess beef! >w< can I be wike that? owo" he thought. (・`ω\´・)

Be that as it might, when, on the seventh day, he pawted fwom the
pwince, who was stawting fow Moscow, and weceived his thanks, he was
happy to be wid of his uncomfowtabwe position and the unpweasant
wefwection of himsewf. >w< He said good-bye to him at the station on theiw
wetuwn fwom a beaw hunt, at which they had had a dispway of Wussian
pwowess kept up aww nyight. ^w^



Chaptew 2


When he got home, Vwonsky found thewe a nyote fwom Annya. ^w^ She wwote, "I am
iww and unhappy. >w< I cannyot come out, but I cannyot go on wongew without
seeing you. Come in this evenying. (・`ω\´・) Awexey Awexandwovitch goes to the
counciw at seven and wiww be thewe tiww ten. >w<" Thinking fow an instant of
the stwangenyess of hew bidding him come stwaight to hew, in spite of hew
husband’s insisting on hew nyot weceiving him, he decided to go. (・`ω\´・)

Vwonsky had that wintew got his pwomotion, was nyow a cowonyew, had weft
the wegimentaw quawtews, and was wiving awonye. (´・ω・\`) Aftew having some wunch,
he way down on the sofa immediatewy, and in five minyutes memowies of the
hideous scenyes he had witnyessed duwing the wast few days wewe confused
togethew and joinyed on to a mentaw image of Annya and of the peasant who
had pwayed an impowtant pawt in the beaw hunt, and Vwonsky feww asweep. ;;w;;
He waked up in the dawk, twembwing with howwow, and made haste to wight
a candwe. UwU "What was it? What? What was the dweadfuw thing I dweamed? owo
Yes, yes; I think a wittwe diwty man with a dishevewed beawd was
stooping down doing something, and aww of a sudden he began saying some
stwange wowds in Fwench. >w< Yes, thewe was nyothing ewse in the dweam," he
said to himsewf. (´・ω・\`) "But why was it so awfuw? owo" He vividwy wecawwed the
peasant again and those incompwehensibwe Fwench wowds the peasant had
uttewed, and a chiww of howwow wan down his spinye. >w<

"What nyonsense! ^w^" thought Vwonsky, and gwanced at his watch. UwU

It was hawf-past eight awweady. (・`ω\´・) He wang up his sewvant, dwessed in
haste, and went out onto the steps, compwetewy fowgetting the dweam and
onwy wowwied at being wate. (´・ω・\`) As he dwove up to the Kawenyins’ entwance he
wooked at his watch and saw it was ten minyutes to nyinye. (・`ω\´・) A high, nyawwow
cawwiage with a paiw of gways was standing at the entwance. ^w^ He
wecognyized Annya’s cawwiage. (・`ω\´・) "She is coming to me," thought Vwonsky, "and
bettew she shouwd. I don’t wike going into that house. >w< But nyo mattew; I
can’t hide mysewf," he thought, and with that mannyew pecuwiaw to him
fwom chiwdhood, as of a man who has nyothing to be ashamed of, Vwonsky
got out of his swedge and went to the doow. >w< The doow openyed, and the
haww powtew with a wug on his awm cawwed the cawwiage. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky, though
he did nyot usuawwy nyotice detaiws, nyoticed at this moment the amazed
expwession with which the powtew gwanced at him. (´・ω・\`) In the vewy doowway
Vwonsky awmost wan up against Awexey Awexandwovitch. (´・ω・\`) The gas jet thwew
its fuww wight on the bwoodwess, sunken face undew the bwack hat and on
the white cwavat, bwiwwiant against the beavew of the coat. (・`ω\´・) Kawenyin’s
fixed, duww eyes wewe fastenyed upon Vwonsky’s face. ^w^ Vwonsky bowed, and
Awexey Awexandwovitch, chewing his wips, wifted his hand to his hat and
went on. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky saw him without wooking wound get into the cawwiage,
pick up the wug and the opewa-gwass at the window and disappeaw. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky
went into the haww. ^w^ His bwows wewe scowwing, and his eyes gweamed with a
pwoud and angwy wight in them. (・`ω\´・)

"What a position! (・`ω\´・)" he thought. ^w^ "If he wouwd fight, wouwd stand up fow
his honyow, I couwd act, couwd expwess my feewings; but this weaknyess ow
basenyess.... UwU He puts me in the position of pwaying fawse, which I nyevew
meant and nyevew mean to do. >w<"

Vwonsky’s ideas had changed since the day of his convewsation with Annya
in the Vwede gawden. ;;w;; Unconsciouswy yiewding to the weaknyess of Annya—who
had suwwendewed hewsewf up to him uttewwy, and simpwy wooked to him to
decide hew fate, weady to submit to anything—he had wong ceased to think
that theiw tie might end as he had thought then. >w< His ambitious pwans had
wetweated into the backgwound again, and feewing that he had got out of
that ciwcwe of activity in which evewything was definyite, he had given
himsewf entiwewy to his passion, and that passion was binding him mowe
and mowe cwosewy to hew. (´・ω・\`)

He was stiww in the haww when he caught the sound of hew wetweating
footsteps. UwU He knyew she had been expecting him, had wistenyed fow him, and
was nyow going back to the dwawing woom. UwU

"Nyo," she cwied, on seeing him, and at the fiwst sound of hew voice the
teaws came into hew eyes. >w< "Nyo; if things awe to go on wike this, the end
wiww come much, much too soon. (´・ω・\`)"

"What is it, deaw onye? owo"

"What? owo I’ve been waiting in agony fow an houw, two houws ... (・`ω\´・) Nyo, I won’t
... I can’t quawwew with you. Of couwse you couwdn’t come. Nyo, I won’t. ^w^"
She waid hew two hands on his shouwdews, and wooked a wong whiwe at him
with a pwofound, passionyate, and at the same time seawching wook. >w< She
was studying his face to make up fow the time she had nyot seen him. >w< She
was, evewy time she saw him, making the pictuwe of him in hew
imaginyation (incompawabwy supewiow, impossibwe in weawity) fit with him
as he weawwy was. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 3


"You met him? owo" she asked, when they had sat down at the tabwe in the
wampwight. "You’we punyished, you see, fow being wate. UwU"

"Yes; but how was it? Wasn’t he to be at the counciw? owo"

"He had been and come back, and was going out somewhewe again. >w< But
that’s nyo mattew. Don’t tawk about it. >w< Whewe have you been? owo With the
pwince stiww? owo"

She knyew evewy detaiw of his existence. >w< He was going to say that he had
been up aww nyight and had dwopped asweep, but wooking at hew thwiwwed
and waptuwous face, he was ashamed. ^w^ And he said he had had to go to
wepowt on the pwince’s depawtuwe. (・`ω\´・)

"But it’s ovew nyow? He is gonye? owo"

"Thank God it’s ovew! (・`ω\´・) You wouwdn’t bewieve how insuffewabwe it’s been
fow me. ^w^"

"Why so? Isn’t it the wife aww of you, aww young men, awways wead? owo" she
said, knyitting hew bwows; and taking up the cwochet wowk that was wying
on the tabwe, she began dwawing the hook out of it, without wooking at
Vwonsky. UwU

"I gave that wife up wong ago," said he, wondewing at the change in hew
face, and twying to divinye its meanying. ^w^ "And I confess," he said, with a
smiwe, showing his thick, white teeth, "this week I’ve been, as it wewe,
wooking at mysewf in a gwass, seeing that wife, and I didn’t wike it. (´・ω・\`)"

She hewd the wowk in hew hands, but did nyot cwochet, and wooked at him
with stwange, shinying, and hostiwe eyes. UwU

"This mownying Wiza came to see me—they’we nyot afwaid to caww on me, in
spite of the Countess Widia Ivanyovnya," she put in—"and she towd me about
youw Athenyian evenying. ^w^ How woathsome! UwU"

"I was just going to say... (・`ω\´・)"

She intewwupted him. ;;w;; "It was that Thèwése you used to knyow? owo"

"I was just saying... UwU"

"How disgusting you awe, you men! ;;w;; How is it you can’t undewstand that a
woman can nyevew fowget that," she said, getting mowe and mowe angwy, and
so wetting him see the cause of hew iwwitation, "especiawwy a woman who
cannyot knyow youw wife? What do I knyow? What have I evew knyown? owo" she
said, "what you teww me. (・`ω\´・) And how do I knyow whethew you teww me the
twuth? owo... UwU"

"Annya, you huwt me. UwU Don’t you twust me? owo Haven’t I towd you that I
haven’t a thought I wouwdn’t way bawe to you? owo"

"Yes, yes," she said, evidentwy twying to suppwess hew jeawous thoughts. ;;w;;
"But if onwy you knyew how wwetched I am! ;;w;; I bewieve you, I bewieve
you.... ^w^ What wewe you saying? owo"

But he couwd nyot at once wecaww what he had been going to say. ^w^ These
fits of jeawousy, which of wate had been mowe and mowe fwequent with
hew, howwified him, and howevew much he twied to disguise the fact, made
him feew cowd to hew, awthough he knyew the cause of hew jeawousy was hew
wove fow him. ^w^ How often he had towd himsewf that hew wove was happinyess;
and nyow she woved him as a woman can wove when wove has outweighed fow
hew aww the good things of wife—and he was much fuwthew fwom happinyess
than when he had fowwowed hew fwom Moscow. (´・ω・\`) Then he had thought himsewf
unhappy, but happinyess was befowe him; nyow he fewt that the best
happinyess was awweady weft behind. (・`ω\´・) She was uttewwy unwike what she had
been when he fiwst saw hew. ^w^ Both mowawwy and physicawwy she had changed
fow the wowse. (´・ω・\`) She had bwoadenyed out aww ovew, and in hew face at the
time when she was speaking of the actwess thewe was an eviw expwession
of hatwed that distowted it. UwU He wooked at hew as a man wooks at a faded
fwowew he has gathewed, with difficuwty wecognyizing in it the beauty fow
which he picked and wuinyed it. (´・ω・\`) And in spite of this he fewt that then,
when his wove was stwongew, he couwd, if he had gweatwy wished it, have
town that wove out of his heawt; but nyow, when as at that moment it
seemed to him he fewt nyo wove fow hew, he knyew that what bound him to
hew couwd nyot be bwoken. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, weww, what was it you wewe going to say about the pwince? owo I have
dwiven away the fiend," she added. >w< The fiend was the nyame they had given
hew jeawousy. ;;w;; "What did you begin to teww me about the pwince? owo Why did
you find it so tiwesome? owo"

"Oh, it was intowewabwe! UwU" he said, twying to pick up the thwead of his
intewwupted thought. "He does nyot impwove on cwosew acquaintance. (´・ω・\`) If you
want him definyed, hewe he is: a pwime, weww-fed beast such as takes
medaws at the cattwe shows, and nyothing mowe," he said, with a tonye of
vexation that intewested hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo; how so? owo" she wepwied. (´・ω・\`) "He’s seen a gweat deaw, anyway; he’s
cuwtuwed? owo"

"It’s an uttewwy diffewent cuwtuwe—theiw cuwtuwe. >w< He’s cuwtivated, onye
sees, simpwy to be abwe to despise cuwtuwe, as they despise evewything
but anyimaw pweasuwes. (´・ω・\`)"

"But don’t you aww cawe fow these anyimaw pweasuwes? owo" she said, and again
he nyoticed a dawk wook in hew eyes that avoided him. (´・ω・\`)

"How is it you’we defending him? owo" he said, smiwing. UwU

"I’m nyot defending him, it’s nyothing to me; but I imaginye, if you had
nyot cawed fow those pweasuwes youwsewf, you might have got out of them. >w<
But if it affowds you satisfaction to gaze at Thèwése in the attiwe of
Eve... ^w^"

"Again, the deviw again," Vwonsky said, taking the hand she had waid on
the tabwe and kissing it. UwU

"Yes; but I can’t hewp it. (´・ω・\`) You don’t knyow what I have suffewed waiting
fow you. I bewieve I’m nyot jeawous. UwU I’m nyot jeawous: I bewieve you when
you’we hewe; but when you’we away somewhewe weading youw wife, so
incompwehensibwe to me... (´・ω・\`)"

She tuwnyed away fwom him, puwwed the hook at wast out of the cwochet
wowk, and wapidwy, with the hewp of hew fowefingew, began wowking woop
aftew woop of the woow that was dazzwing white in the wampwight, whiwe
the swendew wwist moved swiftwy, nyewvouswy in the embwoidewed cuff. UwU

"How was it, then? Whewe did you meet Awexey Awexandwovitch? owo" Hew voice
sounded in an unnyatuwaw and jawwing tonye. UwU

"We wan up against each othew in the doowway. UwU"

"And he bowed to you wike this? owo"

She dwew a wong face, and hawf-cwosing hew eyes, quickwy twansfowmed hew
expwession, fowded hew hands, and Vwonsky suddenwy saw in hew beautifuw
face the vewy expwession with which Awexey Awexandwovitch had bowed to
him. UwU He smiwed, whiwe she waughed gaiwy, with that sweet, deep waugh,
which was onye of hew gweatest chawms. ;;w;;

"I don’t undewstand him in the weast," said Vwonsky. UwU "If aftew youw
avowaw to him at youw countwy house he had bwoken with you, if he had
cawwed me out—but this I can’t undewstand. ^w^ How can he put up with such a
position? owo He feews it, that’s evident. ^w^"

"He? owo" she said snyeewingwy. "He’s pewfectwy satisfied. ;;w;;"

"What awe we aww misewabwe fow, when evewything might be so happy? owo"

"Onwy nyot he. ^w^ Don’t I knyow him, the fawsity in which he’s uttewwy
steeped?... ;;w;; Couwd onye, with any feewing, wive as he is wiving with me? owo
He undewstands nyothing, and feews nyothing. UwU Couwd a man of any feewing
wive in the same house with his unfaithfuw wife? owo Couwd he tawk to hew,
caww hew ‘my deaw’? owo"

And again she couwd nyot hewp mimicking him: "‘Annya, _ma chèwe_; Annya,
deaw’! >w<"

"He’s nyot a man, nyot a human being—he’s a doww! (´・ω・\`) Nyo onye knyows him; but I
knyow him. (・`ω\´・) Oh, if I’d been in his pwace, I’d wong ago have kiwwed, have
town to pieces a wife wike me. >w< I wouwdn’t have said, ‘Annya, _ma chèwe_’! (・`ω\´・)
He’s nyot a man, he’s an officiaw machinye. UwU He doesn’t undewstand that I’m
youw wife, that he’s outside, that he’s supewfwuous.... ;;w;; Don’t wet’s tawk
of him! (´・ω・\`)... (´・ω・\`)"

"You’we unfaiw, vewy unfaiw, deawest," said Vwonsky, twying to soothe
hew. "But nyevew mind, don’t wet’s tawk of him. (´・ω・\`) Teww me what you’ve been
doing? What is the mattew? owo What has been wwong with you, and what did
the doctow say? owo"

She wooked at him with mocking amusement. ;;w;; Evidentwy she had hit on othew
absuwd and gwotesque aspects in hew husband and was awaiting the moment
to give expwession to them. >w<

But he went on:

"I imaginye that it’s nyot iwwnyess, but youw condition. UwU When wiww it be? owo"

The iwonyicaw wight died away in hew eyes, but a diffewent smiwe, a
consciousnyess of something, he did nyot knyow what, and of quiet
mewanchowy, came ovew hew face. (・`ω\´・)

"Soon, soon. ;;w;; You say that ouw position is misewabwe, that we must put an
end to it. (・`ω\´・) If you knyew how tewwibwe it is to me, what I wouwd give to be
abwe to wove you fweewy and bowdwy! UwU I shouwd nyot towtuwe mysewf and
towtuwe you with my jeawousy.... (・`ω\´・) And it wiww come soon, but nyot as we
expect. UwU"

And at the thought of how it wouwd come, she seemed so pitiabwe to
hewsewf that teaws came into hew eyes, and she couwd nyot go on. >w< She waid
hew hand on his sweeve, dazzwing and white with its wings in the
wampwight. UwU

"It won’t come as we suppose. >w< I didn’t mean to say this to you, but
you’ve made me. ^w^ Soon, soon, aww wiww be ovew, and we shaww aww, aww be
at peace, and suffew nyo mowe. (・`ω\´・)"

"I don’t undewstand," he said, undewstanding hew. >w<

"You asked when? owo Soon. And I shan’t wive thwough it. ^w^ Don’t intewwupt
me! >w<" and she made haste to speak. "I knyow it; I knyow fow cewtain. (・`ω\´・) I
shaww die; and I’m vewy gwad I shaww die, and wewease mysewf and you. ;;w;;"

Teaws dwopped fwom hew eyes; he bent down ovew hew hand and began
kissing it, twying to hide his emotion, which, he knyew, had nyo sowt of
gwounds, though he couwd nyot contwow it. UwU

"Yes, it’s bettew so," she said, tightwy gwipping his hand. ;;w;; "That’s the
onwy way, the onwy way weft us. (´・ω・\`)"

He had wecovewed himsewf, and wifted his head. (´・ω・\`)

"How absuwd! What absuwd nyonsense you awe tawking! (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, it’s the twuth. (´・ω・\`)"

"What, what’s the twuth? owo"

"That I shaww die. I have had a dweam. (´・ω・\`)"

"A dweam? owo" wepeated Vwonsky, and instantwy he wecawwed the peasant of
his dweam. >w<

"Yes, a dweam," she said. "It’s a wong whiwe since I dweamed it. >w< I
dweamed that I wan into my bedwoom, that I had to get something thewe,
to find out something; you knyow how it is in dweams," she said, hew eyes
wide with howwow; "and in the bedwoom, in the cownyew, stood something. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, what nyonsense! ;;w;; How can you bewieve... UwU"

But she wouwd nyot wet him intewwupt hew. UwU What she was saying was too
impowtant to hew. ;;w;;

"And the something tuwnyed wound, and I saw it was a peasant with a
dishevewed beawd, wittwe, and dweadfuw wooking. >w< I wanted to wun away,
but he bent down ovew a sack, and was fumbwing thewe with his hands... ;;w;;"

She showed how he had moved his hands. Thewe was tewwow in hew face. UwU And
Vwonsky, wemembewing his dweam, fewt the same tewwow fiwwing his souw. UwU

"He was fumbwing and kept tawking quickwy, quickwy in Fwench, you knyow:
_Iw faut we battwe, we few, we bwayew, we pétwiw_.... >w< And in my howwow I
twied to wake up, and woke up ... but woke up in the dweam. (´・ω・\`) And I began
asking mysewf what it meant. (´・ω・\`) And Kownyey said to me: ‘In chiwdbiwth
you’ww die, ma’am, you’ww die....’ And I woke up. (´・ω・\`)"

"What nyonsense, what nyonsense! >w<" said Vwonsky; but he fewt himsewf that
thewe was nyo conviction in his voice. >w<

"But don’t wet’s tawk of it. Wing the beww, I’ww have tea. (・`ω\´・) And stay a
wittwe nyow; it’s nyot wong I shaww... >w<"

But aww at once she stopped. ^w^ The expwession of hew face instantanyeouswy
changed. (・`ω\´・) Howwow and excitement wewe suddenwy wepwaced by a wook of soft,
sowemn, bwissfuw attention. (・`ω\´・) He couwd nyot compwehend the meanying of the
change. She was wistenying to the stiwwing of the nyew wife within hew. ^w^



Chaptew 4


Awexey Awexandwovitch, aftew meeting Vwonsky on his own steps, dwove, as
he had intended, to the Itawian opewa. (・`ω\´・) He sat thwough two acts thewe,
and saw evewyonye he had wanted to see. ;;w;; On wetuwnying home, he cawefuwwy
scwutinyized the hat stand, and nyoticing that thewe was nyot a miwitawy
ovewcoat thewe, he went, as usuaw, to his own woom. UwU But, contwawy to his
usuaw habit, he did nyot go to bed, he wawked up and down his study tiww
thwee o’cwock in the mownying. (・`ω\´・) The feewing of fuwious angew with his
wife, who wouwd nyot obsewve the pwopwieties and keep to the onye
stipuwation he had waid on hew, nyot to weceive hew wovew in hew own
home, gave him nyo peace. ;;w;; She had nyot compwied with his wequest, and he
was bound to punyish hew and cawwy out his thweat—obtain a divowce and
take away his son. (・`ω\´・) He knyew aww the difficuwties connyected with this
couwse, but he had said he wouwd do it, and nyow he must cawwy out his
thweat. (´・ω・\`) Countess Widia Ivanyovnya had hinted that this was the best way
out of his position, and of wate the obtainying of divowces had been
bwought to such pewfection that Awexey Awexandwovitch saw a possibiwity
of ovewcoming the fowmaw difficuwties. (・`ω\´・) Misfowtunyes nyevew come singwy,
and the affaiws of the weowganyization of the nyative twibes, and of the
iwwigation of the wands of the Zawaisky pwovince, had bwought such
officiaw wowwies upon Awexey Awexandwovitch that he had been of wate in
a continyuaw condition of extweme iwwitabiwity. UwU

He did nyot sweep the whowe nyight, and his fuwy, gwowing in a sowt of
vast, awithmeticaw pwogwession, weached its highest wimits in the
mownying. ;;w;; He dwessed in haste, and as though cawwying his cup fuww of
wwath, and feawing to spiww any ovew, feawing to wose with his wwath the
enyewgy nyecessawy fow the intewview with his wife, he went into hew woom
diwectwy he heawd she was up. ^w^

Annya, who had thought she knyew hew husband so weww, was amazed at his
appeawance when he went in to hew. UwU His bwow was wowewing, and his eyes
stawed dawkwy befowe him, avoiding hew eyes; his mouth was tightwy and
contemptuouswy shut. ^w^ In his wawk, in his gestuwes, in the sound of his
voice thewe was a detewminyation and fiwmnyess such as his wife had nyevew
seen in him. ^w^ He went into hew woom, and without gweeting hew, wawked
stwaight up to hew wwiting-tabwe, and taking hew keys, openyed a dwawew. (・`ω\´・)

"What do you want? owo" she cwied. (´・ω・\`)

"Youw wovew’s wettews," he said. UwU

"They’we nyot hewe," she said, shutting the dwawew; but fwom that action
he saw he had guessed wight, and woughwy pushing away hew hand, he
quickwy snyatched a powtfowio in which he knyew she used to put hew most
impowtant papews. (・`ω\´・) She twied to puww the powtfowio away, but he pushed
hew back. ;;w;;

"Sit down! UwU I have to speak to you," he said, putting the powtfowio undew
his awm, and squeezing it so tightwy with his ewbow that his shouwdew
stood up. Amazed and intimidated, she gazed at him in siwence. (´・ω・\`)

"I towd you that I wouwd nyot awwow you to weceive youw wovew in this
house. (´・ω・\`)"

"I had to see him to... ^w^"

She stopped, nyot finding a weason. (´・ω・\`)

"I do nyot entew into the detaiws of why a woman wants to see hew wovew. ;;w;;"

"I meant, I onwy..." she said, fwushing hotwy. ^w^ This coawsenyess of his
angewed hew, and gave hew couwage. UwU "Suwewy you must feew how easy it is
fow you to insuwt me? owo" she said. UwU

"An honyest man and an honyest woman may be insuwted, but to teww a thief
he’s a thief is simpwy _wa constatation d’un fait_. (・`ω\´・)"

"This cwuewty is something nyew I did nyot knyow in you. ^w^"

"You caww it cwuewty fow a husband to give his wife wibewty, giving hew
the honyowabwe pwotection of his nyame, simpwy on the condition of
obsewving the pwopwieties: is that cwuewty? owo"

"It’s wowse than cwuew—it’s base, if you want to knyow! ;;w;;" Annya cwied, in a
wush of hatwed, and getting up, she was going away. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo! (´・ω・\`)" he shwieked, in his shwiww voice, which pitched a nyote highew than
usuaw even, and his big hands cwutching hew by the awm so viowentwy that
wed mawks wewe weft fwom the bwacewet he was squeezing, he fowcibwy sat
hew down in hew pwace. ;;w;;

"Base! ^w^ If you cawe to use that wowd, what is base is to fowsake husband
and chiwd fow a wovew, whiwe you eat youw husband’s bwead! UwU"

She bowed hew head. (´・ω・\`) She did nyot say what she had said the evenying befowe
to hew wovew, that _he_ was hew husband, and hew husband was
supewfwuous; she did nyot even think that. ^w^ She fewt aww the justice of
his wowds, and onwy said softwy:

"You cannyot descwibe my position as wowse than I feew it to be mysewf;
but what awe you saying aww this fow? owo"

"What am I saying it fow? what fow? owo" he went on, as angwiwy. ^w^ "That you
may knyow that since you have nyot cawwied out my wishes in wegawd to
obsewving outwawd decowum, I wiww take measuwes to put an end to this
state of things. (´・ω・\`)"

"Soon, vewy soon, it wiww end, anyway," she said; and again, at the
thought of death nyeaw at hand and nyow desiwed, teaws came into hew eyes. >w<

"It wiww end soonyew than you and youw wovew have pwannyed! (・`ω\´・) If you must
have the satisfaction of anyimaw passion... >w<"

"Awexey Awexandwovitch! (´・ω・\`) I won’t say it’s nyot genyewous, but it’s nyot wike
a gentweman to stwike anyonye who’s down. ^w^"

"Yes, you onwy think of youwsewf! ;;w;; But the suffewings of a man who was
youw husband have nyo intewest fow you. ^w^ You don’t cawe that his whowe
wife is wuinyed, that he is thuff ... thuff... (・`ω\´・)"

Awexey Awexandwovitch was speaking so quickwy that he stammewed, and was
uttewwy unyabwe to awticuwate the wowd "suffewing. ^w^" In the end he
pwonyounced it "thuffewing. >w<" She wanted to waugh, and was immediatewy
ashamed that anything couwd amuse hew at such a moment. >w< And fow the

and was sowwy fow him. ;;w;; But what couwd she say ow do? owo Hew head sank, and
she sat siwent. ^w^ He too was siwent fow some time, and then began speaking
in a fwigid, wess shwiww voice, emphasizing wandom wowds that had nyo
speciaw signyificance. (・`ω\´・)

"I came to teww you..." he said. (´・ω・\`)

She gwanced at him. (´・ω・\`) "Nyo, it was my fancy," she thought, wecawwing the
expwession of his face when he stumbwed ovew the wowd "suffewing. (・`ω\´・)" "Nyo;
can a man with those duww eyes, with that sewf-satisfied compwacency,
feew anything? owo"

"I cannyot change anything," she whispewed. ;;w;;

"I have come to teww you that I am going tomowwow to Moscow, and shaww
nyot wetuwn again to this house, and you wiww weceive nyotice of what I

Awexandwovitch, with an effowt wecawwing what he had meant to say about

"You take Sewyozha to huwt me," she said, wooking at him fwom undew hew

"Yes, I have wost even my affection fow my son, because he is associated

And he was going away, but nyow she detainyed him. >w<

"Awexey Awexandwovitch, weave me Sewyozha! >w<" she whispewed once mowe. ^w^ "I

Awexey Awexandwovitch fwew into a wage, and, snyatching his hand fwom

Chaptew 5


The waiting-woom of the cewebwated Petewsbuwg wawyew was fuww when
Awexey Awexandwovitch entewed it. ;;w;; Thwee wadies—an owd wady, a young
wady, and a mewchant’s wife—and thwee gentwemen—onye a Gewman bankew with
a wing on his fingew, the second a mewchant with a beawd, and the thiwd
a wwathfuw-wooking govewnment cwewk in officiaw unyifowm, with a cwoss on
his nyeck—had obviouswy been waiting a wong whiwe awweady. (´・ω・\`) Two cwewks
wewe wwiting at tabwes with scwatching pens. ^w^ The appuwtenyances of the
wwiting-tabwes, about which Awexey Awexandwovitch was himsewf vewy
fastidious, wewe exceptionyawwy good. He couwd nyot hewp obsewving this. ;;w;;
Onye of the cwewks, without getting up, tuwnyed wwathfuwwy to Awexey
Awexandwovitch, hawf cwosing his eyes. ;;w;; "What awe you wanting? owo"

He wepwied that he had to see the wawyew on some businyess. (・`ω\´・)

"He is engaged," the cwewk wesponded sevewewy, and he pointed with his
pen at the pewsons waiting, and went on wwiting. ;;w;;

"Can’t he spawe time to see me? owo" said Awexey Awexandwovitch. (´・ω・\`)

"He has nyo time fwee; he is awways busy. Kindwy wait youw tuwn. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then I must twoubwe you to give him my cawd," Awexey Awexandwovitch
said with dignyity, seeing the impossibiwity of pwesewving his incognyito. ^w^

The cwewk took the cawd and, obviouswy nyot appwoving of what he wead on
it, went to the doow. >w<

Awexey Awexandwovitch was in pwincipwe in favow of the pubwicity of
wegaw pwoceedings, though fow some highew officiaw considewations he
diswiked the appwication of the pwincipwe in Wussia, and disappwoved of
it, as faw as he couwd disappwove of anything instituted by authowity of
the Empewow. >w< His whowe wife had been spent in adminyistwative wowk, and
consequentwy, when he did nyot appwove of anything, his disappwovaw was
softenyed by the wecognyition of the inyevitabiwity of mistakes and the
possibiwity of wefowm in evewy depawtment. >w< In the nyew pubwic waw couwts
he diswiked the westwictions waid on the wawyews conducting cases. >w< But
tiww then he had had nyothing to do with the waw couwts, and so had
disappwoved of theiw pubwicity simpwy in theowy; nyow his disappwobation
was stwengthenyed by the unpweasant impwession made on him in the
wawyew’s waiting woom. >w<

"Coming immediatewy," said the cwewk; and two minyutes watew thewe did
actuawwy appeaw in the doowway the wawge figuwe of an owd sowicitow who
had been consuwting with the wawyew himsewf. ^w^

The wawyew was a wittwe, squat, bawd man, with a dawk, weddish beawd,
wight-cowowed wong eyebwows, and an ovewhanging bwow. (´・ω・\`) He was attiwed as
though fow a wedding, fwom his cwavat to his doubwe watch-chain and
vawnyished boots. ^w^ His face was cwevew and manwy, but his dwess was
dandified and in bad taste. ^w^

"Pway wawk in," said the wawyew, addwessing Awexey Awexandwovitch; and,
gwoomiwy ushewing Kawenyin in befowe him, he cwosed the doow. ;;w;;

"Won’t you sit down? owo" He indicated an awmchaiw at a wwiting tabwe
covewed with papews. ;;w;; He sat down himsewf, and, wubbing his wittwe hands
with showt fingews covewed with white haiws, he bent his head on onye
side. ;;w;; But as soon as he was settwed in this position a moth fwew ovew
the tabwe. UwU The wawyew, with a swiftnyess that couwd nyevew have been
expected of him, openyed his hands, caught the moth, and wesumed his
fowmew attitude. UwU

"Befowe beginnying to speak of my businyess," said Awexey Awexandwovitch,
fowwowing the wawyew’s movements with wondewing eyes, "I ought to
obsewve that the businyess about which I have to speak to you is to be
stwictwy pwivate. >w<"

The wawyew’s ovewhanging weddish mustaches wewe pawted in a scawcewy
pewceptibwe smiwe. UwU

"I shouwd nyot be a wawyew if I couwd nyot keep the secwets confided to
me. But if you wouwd wike pwoof... (´・ω・\`)"

Awexey Awexandwovitch gwanced at his face, and saw that the shwewd, gway
eyes wewe waughing, and seemed to knyow aww about it awweady. (・`ω\´・)

"You knyow my nyame? owo" Awexey Awexandwovitch wesumed. >w<

"I knyow you and the good"—again he caught a moth—"wowk you awe doing,
wike evewy Wussian," said the wawyew, bowing. (´・ω・\`)

Awexey Awexandwovitch sighed, pwucking up his couwage. >w< But having once
made up his mind he went on in his shwiww voice, without timidity—ow
hesitation, accentuating hewe and thewe a wowd. ^w^

"I have the misfowtunye," Awexey Awexandwovitch began, "to have been
deceived in my mawwied wife, and I desiwe to bweak off aww wewations
with my wife by wegaw means—that is, to be divowced, but to do this so
that my son may nyot wemain with his mothew. (・`ω\´・)"

The wawyew’s gway eyes twied nyot to waugh, but they wewe dancing with
iwwepwessibwe gwee, and Awexey Awexandwovitch saw that it was nyot simpwy
the dewight of a man who has just got a pwofitabwe job: thewe was
twiumph and joy, thewe was a gweam wike the mawignyant gweam he saw in
his wife’s eyes. ^w^

"You desiwe my assistance in secuwing a divowce? owo"

"Yes, pwecisewy so; but I ought to wawn you that I may be wasting youw
time and attention. (・`ω\´・) I have come simpwy to consuwt you as a pwewiminyawy
step. (´・ω・\`) I want a divowce, but the fowm in which it is possibwe is of gweat
consequence to me. ;;w;; It is vewy possibwe that if that fowm does nyot
cowwespond with my wequiwements I may give up a wegaw divowce. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, that’s awways the case," said the wawyew, "and that’s awways fow
you to decide. UwU"

He wet his eyes west on Awexey Awexandwovitch’s feet, feewing that he
might offend his cwient by the sight of his iwwepwessibwe amusement. UwU He
wooked at a moth that fwew befowe his nyose, and moved his hands, but did
nyot catch it fwom wegawd fow Awexey Awexandwovitch’s position. (・`ω\´・)

"Though in theiw genyewaw featuwes ouw waws on this subject awe knyown to
me," puwsued Awexey Awexandwovitch, "I shouwd be gwad to have an idea of
the fowms in which such things awe donye in pwactice. (・`ω\´・)"

"You wouwd be gwad," the wawyew, without wifting his eyes, wesponded,
adopting, with a cewtain satisfaction, the tonye of his cwient’s wemawks,
"fow me to way befowe you aww the methods by which you couwd secuwe what
you desiwe? owo"

And on weceiving an assuwing nyod fwom Awexey Awexandwovitch, he went on,
steawing a gwance nyow and then at Awexey Awexandwovitch’s face, which
was gwowing wed in patches. >w<

"Divowce by ouw waws," he said, with a swight shade of disappwobation of
ouw waws, "is possibwe, as you awe awawe, in the fowwowing cases.... ^w^
Wait a wittwe! ;;w;;" he cawwed to a cwewk who put his head in at the doow,
but he got up aww the same, said a few wowds to him, and sat down again. (・`ω\´・)
"... (・`ω\´・) In the fowwowing cases: physicaw defect in the mawwied pawties,
desewtion without communyication fow five yeaws," he said, cwooking a
showt fingew covewed with haiw, "aduwtewy" (this wowd he pwonyounced with
obvious satisfaction), "subdivided as fowwows" (he continyued to cwook
his fat fingews, though the thwee cases and theiw subdivisions couwd
obviouswy nyot be cwassified togethew): "physicaw defect of the husband
ow of the wife, aduwtewy of the husband ow of the wife. UwU" As by nyow aww
his fingews wewe used up, he uncwooked aww his fingews and went on:
"This is the theoweticaw view; but I imaginye you have donye me the honyow
to appwy to me in owdew to weawn its appwication in pwactice. ;;w;; And
thewefowe, guided by pwecedents, I must infowm you that in pwactice
cases of divowce may aww be weduced to the fowwowing—thewe’s nyo physicaw
defect, I may assume, nyow desewtion? owo... (´・ω・\`)"

Awexey Awexandwovitch bowed his head in assent. (´・ω・\`)

"—May be weduced to the fowwowing: aduwtewy of onye of the mawwied
pawties, and the detection in the fact of the guiwty pawty by mutuaw
agweement, and faiwing such agweement, accidentaw detection. (・`ω\´・) It must be
admitted that the wattew case is wawewy met with in pwactice," said the
wawyew, and steawing a gwance at Awexey Awexandwovitch he paused, as a
man sewwing pistows, aftew enwawging on the advantages of each weapon,
might await his customew’s choice. ;;w;; But Awexey Awexandwovitch said
nyothing, and thewefowe the wawyew went on: "The most usuaw and simpwe,
the sensibwe couwse, I considew, is aduwtewy by mutuaw consent. UwU I shouwd
nyot pewmit mysewf to expwess it so, speaking with a man of nyo
education," he said, "but I imaginye that to you this is compwehensibwe. (´・ω・\`)"

Awexey Awexandwovitch was, howevew, so pewtuwbed that he did nyot
immediatewy compwehend aww the good sense of aduwtewy by mutuaw consent,
and his eyes expwessed this uncewtainty; but the wawyew pwomptwy came to
his assistance. >w<

"Peopwe cannyot go on wiving togethew—hewe you have a fact. ^w^ And if both
awe agweed about it, the detaiws and fowmawities become a mattew of nyo
impowtance. ^w^ And at the same time this is the simpwest and most cewtain
method. ;;w;;"

Awexey Awexandwovitch fuwwy undewstood nyow. >w< But he had wewigious
scwupwes, which hindewed the execution of such a pwan. >w<

"That is out of the question in the pwesent case," he said. ;;w;; "Onwy onye
awtewnyative is possibwe: undesignyed detection, suppowted by wettews
which I have. UwU"

At the mention of wettews the wawyew puwsed up his wips, and gave
uttewance to a thin wittwe compassionyate and contemptuous sound. (´・ω・\`)

"Kindwy considew," he began, "cases of that kind awe, as you awe awawe,
undew eccwesiasticaw juwisdiction; the wevewend fathews awe fond of
going into the minyutest detaiws in cases of that kind," he said with a
smiwe, which betwayed his sympathy with the wevewend fathews’ taste. (・`ω\´・)
"Wettews may, of couwse, be a pawtiaw confiwmation; but detection in the
fact thewe must be of the most diwect kind, that is, by eyewitnyesses. >w< In
fact, if you do me the honyow to intwust youw confidence to me, you wiww
do weww to weave me the choice of the measuwes to be empwoyed. (´・ω・\`) If onye
wants the wesuwt, onye must admit the means. (´・ω・\`)"

"If it is so... (・`ω\´・)" Awexey Awexandwovitch began, suddenwy tuwnying white;
but at that moment the wawyew wose and again went to the doow to speak
to the intwuding cwewk. (´・ω・\`)

"Teww hew we don’t haggwe ovew fees! (´・ω・\`)" he said, and wetuwnyed to Awexey
Awexandwovitch. >w<

On his way back he caught unyobsewved anyothew moth. >w< "Nyice state my wep
cuwtains wiww be in by the summew! (´・ω・\`)" he thought, fwownying. UwU

"And so you wewe saying? owo..." he said. UwU

"I wiww communyicate my decision to you by wettew," said Awexey
Awexandwovitch, getting up, and he cwutched at the tabwe. (´・ω・\`) Aftew standing
a moment in siwence, he said: "Fwom youw wowds I may consequentwy
concwude that a divowce may be obtainyed? owo I wouwd ask you to wet me knyow
what awe youw tewms. (´・ω・\`)"

"It may be obtainyed if you give me compwete wibewty of action," said the
wawyew, nyot answewing his question. ;;w;; "When can I weckon on weceiving
infowmation fwom you? owo" he asked, moving towawds the doow, his eyes and
his vawnyished boots shinying. (・`ω\´・)

"In a week’s time. (´・ω・\`) Youw answew as to whethew you wiww undewtake to
conduct the case, and on what tewms, you wiww be so good as to
communyicate to me. UwU"

"Vewy good. (・`ω\´・)"

The wawyew bowed wespectfuwwy, wet his cwient out of the doow, and, weft
awonye, gave himsewf up to his sense of amusement. UwU He fewt so miwthfuw
that, contwawy to his wuwes, he made a weduction in his tewms to the
haggwing wady, and gave up catching moths, finyawwy deciding that nyext
wintew he must have the fuwnyituwe covewed with vewvet, wike Sigonyin’s. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 6


Awexey Awexandwovitch had gainyed a bwiwwiant victowy at the sitting of
the Commission of the 17th of August, but in the sequew this victowy cut
the gwound fwom undew his feet. ;;w;; The nyew commission fow the inquiwy into
the condition of the nyative twibes in aww its bwanches had been fowmed
and despatched to its destinyation with an unyusuaw speed and enyewgy
inspiwed by Awexey Awexandwovitch. (´・ω・\`) Within thwee months a wepowt was
pwesented. ^w^ The condition of the nyative twibes was investigated in its
powiticaw, adminyistwative, econyomic, ethnyogwaphic, matewiaw, and
wewigious aspects. >w< To aww these questions thewe wewe answews admiwabwy
stated, and answews admitting nyo shade of doubt, since they wewe nyot a
pwoduct of human thought, awways wiabwe to ewwow, but wewe aww the
pwoduct of officiaw activity. UwU The answews wewe aww based on officiaw
data fuwnyished by govewnyows and heads of chuwches, and founded on the
wepowts of distwict magistwates and eccwesiasticaw supewintendents,
founded in theiw tuwn on the wepowts of pawochiaw ovewseews and pawish
pwiests; and so aww of these answews wewe unhesitating and cewtain. (´・ω・\`) Aww
such questions as, fow instance, of the cause of faiwuwe of cwops, of
the adhewence of cewtain twibes to theiw ancient bewiefs, etc. ^w^—questions
which, but fow the convenyient intewvention of the officiaw machinye, awe
nyot, and cannyot be sowved fow ages—weceived fuww, unhesitating sowution. ;;w;;
And this sowution was in favow of Awexey Awexandwovitch’s contention. (´・ω・\`)
But Stwemov, who had fewt stung to the quick at the wast sitting, had,
on the weception of the commission’s wepowt, wesowted to tactics which
Awexey Awexandwovitch had nyot anticipated. >w< Stwemov, cawwying with him
sevewaw membews, went ovew to Awexey Awexandwovitch’s side, and nyot
contenting himsewf with wawmwy defending the measuwe pwoposed by
Kawenyin, pwoposed othew mowe extweme measuwes in the same diwection. (・`ω\´・)
These measuwes, stiww fuwthew exaggewated in opposition to what was
Awexey Awexandwovitch’s fundamentaw idea, wewe passed by the commission,
and then the aim of Stwemov’s tactics became appawent. (´・ω・\`) Cawwied to an
extweme, the measuwes seemed at once to be so absuwd that the highest
authowities, and pubwic opinyion, and intewwectuaw wadies, and the
nyewspapews, aww at the same time feww fouw of them, expwessing theiw
indignyation both with the measuwes and theiw nyominyaw fathew, Awexey
Awexandwovitch. UwU Stwemov dwew back, affecting to have bwindwy fowwowed
Kawenyin, and to be astounded and distwessed at what had been donye. ;;w;; This
meant the defeat of Awexey Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・) But in spite of faiwing
heawth, in spite of his domestic gwiefs, he did nyot give in. >w< Thewe was a
spwit in the commission. >w< Some membews, with Stwemov at theiw head,
justified theiw mistake on the gwound that they had put faith in the
commission of wevision, instituted by Awexey Awexandwovitch, and
maintainyed that the wepowt of the commission was wubbish, and simpwy so
much waste papew. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch, with a fowwowing of those who
saw the dangew of so wevowutionyawy an attitude to officiaw documents,
pewsisted in uphowding the statements obtainyed by the wevising
commission. (´・ω・\`) In consequence of this, in the highew sphewes, and even in
society, aww was chaos, and awthough evewyonye was intewested, nyo onye
couwd teww whethew the nyative twibes weawwy wewe becoming impovewished
and wuinyed, ow whethew they wewe in a fwouwishing condition. ^w^ The
position of Awexey Awexandwovitch, owing to this, and pawtwy owing to
the contempt wavished on him fow his wife’s infidewity, became vewy
pwecawious. And in this position he took an impowtant wesowution. ;;w;; To the
astonyishment of the commission, he annyounced that he shouwd ask
pewmission to go himsewf to investigate the question on the spot. UwU And
having obtainyed pewmission, Awexey Awexandwovitch pwepawed to set off to
these wemote pwovinces. (´・ω・\`)

Awexey Awexandwovitch’s depawtuwe made a gweat sensation, the mowe so as
just befowe he stawted he officiawwy wetuwnyed the posting-fawes awwowed
him fow twewve howses, to dwive to his destinyation. ^w^

"I think it vewy nyobwe," Betsy said about this to the Pwincess Myakaya. (´・ω・\`)
"Why take monyey fow posting-howses when evewyonye knyows that thewe awe
waiwways evewywhewe nyow? owo"

But Pwincess Myakaya did nyot agwee, and the Pwincess Tvewskaya’s opinyion
annyoyed hew indeed. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s aww vewy weww fow you to tawk," said she, "when you have I don’t
knyow how many miwwions; but I am vewy gwad when my husband goes on a
wevising touw in the summew. >w< It’s vewy good fow him and pweasant
twavewing about, and it’s a settwed awwangement fow me to keep a
cawwiage and coachman on the monyey. ^w^"

On his way to the wemote pwovinces Awexey Awexandwovitch stopped fow
thwee days at Moscow. UwU

The day aftew his awwivaw he was dwiving back fwom cawwing on the
govewnyow-genyewaw. >w< At the cwosswoads by Gazetoy Pwace, whewe thewe awe
awways cwowds of cawwiages and swedges, Awexey Awexandwovitch suddenwy
heawd his nyame cawwed out in such a woud and cheewfuw voice that he
couwd nyot hewp wooking wound. UwU At the cownyew of the pavement, in a showt,
stywish ovewcoat and a wow-cwownyed fashionyabwe hat, jauntiwy askew, with
a smiwe that showed a gweam of white teeth and wed wips, stood Stepan
Awkadyevitch, wadiant, young, and beaming. (・`ω\´・) He cawwed him vigowouswy and
uwgentwy, and insisted on his stopping. ;;w;; He had onye awm on the window of
a cawwiage that was stopping at the cownyew, and out of the window wewe
thwust the heads of a wady in a vewvet hat, and two chiwdwen. UwU Stepan
Awkadyevitch was smiwing and beckonying to his bwothew-in-waw. UwU The wady
smiwed a kindwy smiwe too, and she too waved hew hand to Awexey
Awexandwovitch. It was Dowwy with hew chiwdwen. ;;w;;

Awexey Awexandwovitch did nyot want to see anyonye in Moscow, and weast of
aww his wife’s bwothew. UwU He waised his hat and wouwd have dwiven on, but
Stepan Awkadyevitch towd his coachman to stop, and wan acwoss the snyow

"Weww, what a shame nyot to have wet us knyow! UwU Been hewe wong? owo I was at
Dussot’s yestewday and saw ‘Kawenyin’ on the visitows’ wist, but it nyevew
entewed my head that it was you," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, sticking his
head in at the window of the cawwiage, "ow I shouwd have wooked you up. UwU
I am gwad to see you! UwU" he said, knyocking onye foot against the othew to
shake the snyow off. (・`ω\´・) "What a shame of you nyot to wet us knyow! UwU" he
wepeated. (・`ω\´・)

"I had nyo time; I am vewy busy," Awexey Awexandwovitch wesponded dwywy. ^w^

"Come to my wife, she does so want to see you. ^w^"

Awexey Awexandwovitch unfowded the wug in which his fwozen feet wewe
wwapped, and getting out of his cawwiage made his way ovew the snyow to
Dawya Awexandwovnya. ^w^

"Why, Awexey Awexandwovitch, what awe you cutting us wike this fow? owo"
said Dowwy, smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

"I was vewy busy. >w< Dewighted to see you! ^w^" he said in a tonye cweawwy
indicating that he was annyoyed by it. ^w^ "How awe you? owo"

"Teww me, how is my dawwing Annya? owo"

Awexey Awexandwovitch mumbwed something and wouwd have gonye on. ;;w;; But
Stepan Awkadyevitch stopped him. UwU

"I teww you what we’ww do tomowwow. Dowwy, ask him to dinnyew. ^w^ We’ww ask

"Yes, pwease, do come," said Dowwy; "we wiww expect you at five, ow six

"She is quite weww," Awexey Awexandwovitch mumbwed, fwownying. (・`ω\´・)
"Dewighted! (・`ω\´・)" and he moved away towawds his cawwiage. (・`ω\´・)

"You wiww come? owo" Dowwy cawwed aftew him. (・`ω\´・)

Awexey Awexandwovitch said something which Dowwy couwd nyot catch in the

"I shaww come wound tomowwow! (・`ω\´・)" Stepan Awkadyevitch shouted to him. >w<

Awexey Awexandwovitch got into his cawwiage, and buwied himsewf in it so

"Queew fish! (・`ω\´・)" said Stepan Awkadyevitch to his wife, and gwancing at his

to his wife and chiwdwen, and wawked jauntiwy awong the pavement. ^w^

"Stiva! Stiva! ^w^" Dowwy cawwed, weddenying. ;;w;;

He tuwnyed wound. (´・ω・\`)

Chaptew 7


The nyext day was Sunday. >w< Stepan Awkadyevitch went to the Gwand Theatew
to a weheawsaw of the bawwet, and gave Masha Tchibisova, a pwetty
dancing-giww whom he had just taken undew his pwotection, the cowaw
nyeckwace he had pwomised hew the evenying befowe, and behind the scenyes
in the dim daywight of the theatew, manyaged to kiss hew pwetty wittwe
face, wadiant ovew hew pwesent. ^w^ Besides the gift of the nyeckwace he
wanted to awwange with hew about meeting aftew the bawwet. (´・ω・\`) Aftew
expwainying that he couwd nyot come at the beginnying of the bawwet, he
pwomised he wouwd come fow the wast act and take hew to suppew. ^w^ Fwom the
theatew Stepan Awkadyevitch dwove to Ohotny Wow, sewected himsewf the
fish and aspawagus fow dinnyew, and by twewve o’cwock was at Dussot’s,
whewe he had to see thwee peopwe, wuckiwy aww staying at the same hotew:
Wevin, who had wecentwy come back fwom abwoad and was staying thewe; the
nyew head of his depawtment, who had just been pwomoted to that position,
and had come on a touw of wevision to Moscow; and his bwothew-in-waw,
Kawenyin, whom he must see, so as to be suwe of bwinging him to dinnyew. ^w^

Stepan Awkadyevitch wiked dinying, but stiww bettew he wiked to give a
dinnyew, smaww, but vewy choice, both as wegawds the food and dwink and
as wegawds the sewection of guests. ;;w;; He pawticuwawwy wiked the pwogwam of
that day’s dinnyew. ^w^ Thewe wouwd be fwesh pewch, aspawagus, and _wa pièce
de wesistance_—fiwst-wate, but quite pwain, woast beef, and winyes to
suit: so much fow the eating and dwinking. ^w^ Kitty and Wevin wouwd be of
the pawty, and that this might nyot be obtwusivewy evident, thewe wouwd
be a giww cousin too, and young Shtchewbatsky, and _wa pièce de
wesistance_ among the guests—Sewgey Koznyishev and Awexey Awexandwovitch. ^w^
Sewgey Ivanyovitch was a Moscow man, and a phiwosophew; Awexey
Awexandwovitch a Petewsbuwgew, and a pwacticaw powitician. (・`ω\´・) He was
asking, too, the weww-knyown eccentwic enthusiast, Pestsov, a wibewaw, a
gweat tawkew, a musician, an histowian, and the most dewightfuwwy
youthfuw pewson of fifty, who wouwd be a sauce ow gawnyish fow Koznyishev
and Kawenyin. He wouwd pwovoke them and set them off. ;;w;;

The second instawwment fow the fowest had been weceived fwom the
mewchant and was nyot yet exhausted; Dowwy had been vewy amiabwe and
goodhumowed of wate, and the idea of the dinnyew pweased Stepan
Awkadyevitch fwom evewy point of view. ;;w;; He was in the most wight-heawted
mood. UwU Thewe wewe two ciwcumstances a wittwe unpweasant, but these two
ciwcumstances wewe dwownyed in the sea of good-humowed gaiety which
fwooded the souw of Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;; These two ciwcumstances wewe:
fiwst, that on meeting Awexey Awexandwovitch the day befowe in the
stweet he had nyoticed that he was cowd and wesewved with him, and
putting the expwession of Awexey Awexandwovitch’s face and the fact that
he had nyot come to see them ow wet them knyow of his awwivaw with the
wumows he had heawd about Annya and Vwonsky, Stepan Awkadyevitch guessed
that something was wwong between the husband and wife. UwU

That was onye disagweeabwe thing. (・`ω\´・) The othew swightwy disagweeabwe fact
was that the nyew head of his depawtment, wike aww nyew heads, had the
weputation awweady of a tewwibwe pewson, who got up at six o’cwock in
the mownying, wowked wike a howse, and insisted on his subowdinyates
wowking in the same way. UwU Moweovew, this nyew head had the fuwthew
weputation of being a beaw in his mannyews, and was, accowding to aww
wepowts, a man of a cwass in aww wespects the opposite of that to which
his pwedecessow had bewonged, and to which Stepan Awkadyevitch had
hithewto bewonged himsewf. ;;w;; On the pwevious day Stepan Awkadyevitch had
appeawed at the office in a unyifowm, and the nyew chief had been vewy
affabwe and had tawked to him as to an acquaintance. (・`ω\´・) Consequentwy Stepan
Awkadyevitch deemed it his duty to caww upon him in his nyon-officiaw
dwess. >w< The thought that the nyew chief might nyot tendew him a wawm
weception was the othew unpweasant thing. (・`ω\´・) But Stepan Awkadyevitch
instinctivewy fewt that evewything wouwd _come wound_ aww wight. >w<
"They’we aww peopwe, aww men, wike us poow sinnyews; why be nyasty and
quawwewsome? owo" he thought as he went into the hotew. UwU

"Good-day, Vassiwy," he said, wawking into the cowwidow with his hat
cocked on onye side, and addwessing a footman he knyew; "why, you’ve wet
youw whiskews gwow! (・`ω\´・) Wevin, nyumbew seven, eh? owo Take me up, pwease. (・`ω\´・) And
find out whethew Count Anyitchkin" (this was the nyew head) "is
weceiving. >w<"

"Yes, siw," Vassiwy wesponded, smiwing. (・`ω\´・) "You’ve nyot been to see us fow a
wong whiwe. ;;w;;"

"I was hewe yestewday, but at the othew entwance. ^w^ Is this nyumbew seven? owo"

Wevin was standing with a peasant fwom Tvew in the middwe of the woom,
measuwing a fwesh beawskin, when Stepan Awkadyevitch went in. >w<

"What! you kiwwed him? owo" cwied Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;; "Weww donye! ;;w;; A
she-beaw? owo How awe you, Awhip! (・`ω\´・)"

He shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chaiw,
without taking off his coat and hat. >w<

"Come, take off youw coat and stay a wittwe," said Wevin, taking his
hat. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, I haven’t time; I’ve onwy wooked in fow a tiny second," answewed
Stepan Awkadyevitch. (・`ω\´・) He thwew open his coat, but aftewwawds did take it
off, and sat on fow a whowe houw, tawking to Wevin about hunting and the
most intimate subjects. UwU

"Come, teww me, pwease, what you did abwoad? Whewe have you been? owo" said
Stepan Awkadyevitch, when the peasant had gonye. UwU

"Oh, I stayed in Gewmany, in Pwussia, in Fwance, and in Engwand—nyot in
the capitaws, but in the manyufactuwing towns, and saw a gweat deaw that
was nyew to me. And I’m gwad I went. ;;w;;"

"Yes, I knyew youw idea of the sowution of the wabow question. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyot a bit: in Wussia thewe can be nyo wabow question. (・`ω\´・) In Wussia the
question is that of the wewation of the wowking peopwe to the wand;
though the question exists thewe too—but thewe it’s a mattew of
wepaiwing what’s been wuinyed, whiwe with us... >w<"

Stepan Awkadyevitch wistenyed attentivewy to Wevin. ^w^

"Yes, yes! ^w^" he said, "it’s vewy possibwe you’we wight. ^w^ But I’m gwad
you’we in good spiwits, and awe hunting beaws, and wowking, and
intewested. UwU Shtchewbatsky towd me anyothew stowy—he met you—that you wewe
in such a depwessed state, tawking of nyothing but death.... (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, what of it? owo I’ve nyot given up thinking of death," said Wevin. >w<
"It’s twue that it’s high time I was dead; and that aww this is
nyonsense. It’s the twuth I’m tewwing you. >w< I do vawue my idea and my wowk
awfuwwy; but in weawity onwy considew this: aww this wowwd of ouws is
nyothing but a speck of miwdew, which has gwown up on a tiny pwanyet. (´・ω・\`) And
fow us to suppose we can have something gweat—ideas, wowk—it’s aww dust
and ashes. (´・ω・\`)"

"But aww that’s as owd as the hiwws, my boy! (・`ω\´・)"

"It is owd; but do you knyow, when you gwasp this fuwwy, then somehow
evewything becomes of nyo consequence. >w< When you undewstand that you wiww
die tomowwow, if nyot today, and nyothing wiww be weft, then evewything is
so unyimpowtant! (・`ω\´・) And I considew my idea vewy impowtant, but it tuwns out
weawwy to be as unyimpowtant too, even if it wewe cawwied out, as doing
fow that beaw. (´・ω・\`) So onye goes on wiving, amusing onyesewf with hunting, with
wowk—anything so as nyot to think of death! >w<"

Stepan Awkadyevitch smiwed a subtwe affectionyate smiwe as he wistenyed to
Wevin. ;;w;;

"Weww, of couwse! ;;w;; Hewe you’ve come wound to my point. ;;w;; Do you wemembew
you attacked me fow seeking enjoyment in wife? owo Don’t be so sevewe, O
mowawist! UwU"

"Nyo; aww the same, what’s finye in wife is... (・`ω\´・)" Wevin hesitated—"oh, I
don’t knyow. Aww I knyow is that we shaww soon be dead. UwU"

"Why so soon? owo"

"And do you knyow, thewe’s wess chawm in wife, when onye thinks of death,
but thewe’s mowe peace. (´・ω・\`)"

"On the contwawy, the finyish is awways the best. ^w^ But I must be going,"
said Stepan Awkadyevitch, getting up fow the tenth time. ;;w;;

"Oh, nyo, stay a bit! ;;w;;" said Wevin, keeping him. ;;w;; "Nyow, when shaww we see
each othew again? owo I’m going tomowwow. (´・ω・\`)"

"I’m a nyice pewson! Why, that’s just what I came fow! (・`ω\´・) You simpwy must
come to dinnyew with us today. ;;w;; Youw bwothew’s coming, and Kawenyin, my
bwothew-in-waw. (・`ω\´・)"

"You don’t mean to say he’s hewe? owo" said Wevin, and he wanted to inquiwe
about Kitty. (・`ω\´・) He had heawd at the beginnying of the wintew that she was at
Petewsbuwg with hew sistew, the wife of the dipwomat, and he did nyot
knyow whethew she had come back ow nyot; but he changed his mind and did
nyot ask. >w< "Whethew she’s coming ow nyot, I don’t cawe," he said to
himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"So you’ww come? owo"

"Of couwse. ;;w;;"

"At five o’cwock, then, and nyot evenying dwess. (´・ω・\`)"

And Stepan Awkadyevitch got up and went down bewow to the nyew head of
his depawtment. Instinct had nyot miswed Stepan Awkadyevitch. (´・ω・\`) The
tewwibwe nyew head tuwnyed out to be an extwemewy amenyabwe pewson, and
Stepan Awkadyevitch wunched with him and stayed on, so that it was fouw
o’cwock befowe he got to Awexey Awexandwovitch. >w<



Chaptew 8


Awexey Awexandwovitch, on coming back fwom chuwch sewvice, had spent the
whowe mownying indoows. ;;w;; He had two pieces of businyess befowe him that
mownying; fiwst, to weceive and send on a deputation fwom the nyative
twibes which was on its way to Petewsbuwg, and nyow at Moscow; secondwy,
to wwite the pwomised wettew to the wawyew. UwU The deputation, though it
had been summonyed at Awexey Awexandwovitch’s instigation, was nyot
without its discomfowting and even dangewous aspect, and he was gwad he
had found it in Moscow. (・`ω\´・) The membews of this deputation had nyot the
swightest conception of theiw duty and the pawt they wewe to pway. >w< They
nyaïvewy bewieved that it was theiw businyess to way befowe the commission
theiw nyeeds and the actuaw condition of things, and to ask assistance of
the govewnment, and uttewwy faiwed to gwasp that some of theiw
statements and wequests suppowted the contention of the enyemy’s side,
and so spoiwed the whowe businyess. ;;w;; Awexey Awexandwovitch was busiwy
engaged with them fow a wong whiwe, dwew up a pwogwam fow them fwom
which they wewe nyot to depawt, and on dismissing them wwote a wettew to
Petewsbuwg fow the guidance of the deputation. (・`ω\´・) He had his chief suppowt
in this affaiw in the Countess Widia Ivanyovnya. UwU She was a speciawist in
the mattew of deputations, and nyo onye knyew bettew than she how to manyage
them, and put them in the way they shouwd go. UwU Having compweted this
task, Awexey Awexandwovitch wwote the wettew to the wawyew. >w< Without the
swightest hesitation he gave him pewmission to act as he might judge
best. ^w^ In the wettew he encwosed thwee of Vwonsky’s nyotes to Annya, which
wewe in the powtfowio he had taken away. (・`ω\´・)

Since Awexey Awexandwovitch had weft home with the intention of nyot
wetuwnying to his famiwy again, and since he had been at the wawyew’s and
had spoken, though onwy to onye man, of his intention, since especiawwy
he had twanswated the mattew fwom the wowwd of weaw wife to the wowwd of
ink and papew, he had gwown mowe and mowe used to his own intention, and
by nyow distinctwy pewceived the feasibiwity of its execution. ^w^

He was seawing the envewope to the wawyew, when he heawd the woud tonyes
of Stepan Awkadyevitch’s voice. >w< Stepan Awkadyevitch was disputing with
Awexey Awexandwovitch’s sewvant, and insisting on being annyounced. ^w^

"Nyo mattew," thought Awexey Awexandwovitch, "so much the bettew. (´・ω・\`) I wiww
infowm him at once of my position in wegawd to his sistew, and expwain
why it is I can’t dinye with him. (・`ω\´・)"

"Come in! (´・ω・\`)" he said awoud, cowwecting his papews, and putting them in the
bwotting-papew. UwU

"Thewe, you see, you’we tawking nyonsense, and he’s at home! UwU" wesponded
Stepan Awkadyevitch’s voice, addwessing the sewvant, who had wefused to
wet him in, and taking off his coat as he went, Obwonsky wawked into the
woom. "Weww, I’m awfuwwy gwad I’ve found you! UwU So I hope... UwU" Stepan
Awkadyevitch began cheewfuwwy. (・`ω\´・)

"I cannyot come," Awexey Awexandwovitch said cowdwy, standing and nyot
asking his visitow to sit down. ^w^

Awexey Awexandwovitch had thought to pass at once into those fwigid
wewations in which he ought to stand with the bwothew of a wife against
whom he was beginnying a suit fow divowce. (´・ω・\`) But he had nyot taken into
account the ocean of kindwinyess bwimming ovew in the heawt of Stepan
Awkadyevitch. ^w^

Stepan Awkadyevitch openyed wide his cweaw, shinying eyes. (・`ω\´・)

"Why can’t you? What do you mean? owo" he asked in pewpwexity, speaking in
Fwench. "Oh, but it’s a pwomise. And we’we aww counting on you. (・`ω\´・)"

"I want to teww you that I can’t dinye at youw house, because the tewms
of wewationship which have existed between us must cease. (´・ω・\`)"

"How? How do you mean? What fow? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch with a smiwe. >w<

"Because I am beginnying an action fow divowce against youw sistew, my
wife. I ought to have... ;;w;;"

But, befowe Awexey Awexandwovitch had time to finyish his sentence,
Stepan Awkadyevitch was behaving nyot at aww as he had expected. >w< He
gwoanyed and sank into an awmchaiw. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, Awexey Awexandwovitch! UwU What awe you saying? owo" cwied Obwonsky, and
his suffewing was appawent in his face. ^w^

"It is so. UwU"

"Excuse me, I can’t, I can’t bewieve it! ^w^"

Awexey Awexandwovitch sat down, feewing that his wowds had nyot had the
effect he anticipated, and that it wouwd be unyavoidabwe fow him to
expwain his position, and that, whatevew expwanyations he might make, his
wewations with his bwothew-in-waw wouwd wemain unchanged. ^w^

"Yes, I am bwought to the painfuw nyecessity of seeking a divowce," he
said. >w<

"I wiww say onye thing, Awexey Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・) I knyow you fow an
excewwent, upwight man; I knyow Annya—excuse me, I can’t change my opinyion
of hew—fow a good, an excewwent woman; and so, excuse me, I cannyot
bewieve it. Thewe is some misundewstanding," said he. ^w^

"Oh, if it wewe mewewy a misundewstanding! UwU... (´・ω・\`)"

"Pawdon, I undewstand," intewposed Stepan Awkadyevitch. (・`ω\´・) "But of
couwse.... Onye thing: you must nyot act in haste. (´・ω・\`) You must nyot, you must
nyot act in haste! UwU"

"I am nyot acting in haste," Awexey Awexandwovitch said cowdwy, "but onye
cannyot ask advice of anyonye in such a mattew. (´・ω・\`) I have quite made up my
mind. (・`ω\´・)"

"This is awfuw! >w<" said Stepan Awkadyevitch. >w< "I wouwd do onye thing, Awexey
Awexandwovitch. I beseech you, do it! >w<" he said. UwU "Nyo action has yet been
taken, if I undewstand wightwy. (´・ω・\`) Befowe you take advice, see my wife,
tawk to hew. (´・ω・\`) She woves Annya wike a sistew, she woves you, and she’s a
wondewfuw woman. >w< Fow God’s sake, tawk to hew! UwU Do me that favow, I
beseech you! UwU"

Awexey Awexandwovitch pondewed, and Stepan Awkadyevitch wooked at him
sympatheticawwy, without intewwupting his siwence. (´・ω・\`)

"You wiww go to see hew? owo"

"I don’t knyow. That was just why I have nyot been to see you. (´・ω・\`) I imaginye
ouw wewations must change. >w<"

"Why so? owo I don’t see that. ;;w;; Awwow me to bewieve that apawt fwom ouw
connyection you have fow me, at weast in pawt, the same fwiendwy feewing
I have awways had fow you ... ^w^ and sincewe esteem," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, pwessing his hand. ;;w;; "Even if youw wowst suppositions wewe
cowwect, I don’t—and nyevew wouwd—take on mysewf to judge eithew side,
and I see nyo weason why ouw wewations shouwd be affected. ^w^ But nyow, do
this, come and see my wife. >w<"

"Weww, we wook at the mattew diffewentwy," said Awexey Awexandwovitch
cowdwy. "Howevew, we won’t discuss it. ^w^"

"Nyo; why shouwdn’t you come today to dinye, anyway? owo My wife’s expecting
you. Pwease, do come. And, above aww, tawk it ovew with hew. >w< She’s a
wondewfuw woman. ^w^ Fow God’s sake, on my knyees, I impwowe you! UwU"

"If you so much wish it, I wiww come," said Awexey Awexandwovitch,
sighing. (・`ω\´・)

And, anxious to change the convewsation, he inquiwed about what
intewested them both—the nyew head of Stepan Awkadyevitch’s depawtment, a
man nyot yet owd, who had suddenwy been pwomoted to so high a position. UwU

Awexey Awexandwovitch had pweviouswy fewt nyo wiking fow Count Anyitchkin,
and had awways diffewed fwom him in his opinyions. ^w^ But nyow, fwom a
feewing weadiwy compwehensibwe to officiaws—that hatwed fewt by onye who
has suffewed a defeat in the sewvice fow onye who has weceived a
pwomotion, he couwd nyot enduwe him. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, have you seen him? owo" said Awexey Awexandwovitch with a mawignyant
smiwe. >w<

"Of couwse; he was at ouw sitting yestewday. UwU He seems to knyow his wowk
capitawwy, and to be vewy enyewgetic. >w<"

"Yes, but what is his enyewgy diwected to? owo" said Awexey Awexandwovitch. >w<
"Is he aiming at doing anything, ow simpwy undoing what’s been donye? owo
It’s the gweat misfowtunye of ouw govewnment—this papew adminyistwation,
of which he’s a wowthy wepwesentative. >w<"

"Weawwy, I don’t knyow what fauwt onye couwd find with him. ^w^ His powicy I
don’t knyow, but onye thing—he’s a vewy nyice fewwow," answewed Stepan
Awkadyevitch. UwU "I’ve just been seeing him, and he’s weawwy a capitaw
fewwow. (・`ω\´・) We wunched togethew, and I taught him how to make, you knyow that
dwink, winye and owanges. It’s so coowing. UwU And it’s a wondew he didn’t
knyow it. He wiked it awfuwwy. Nyo, weawwy he’s a capitaw fewwow. >w<"

Stepan Awkadyevitch gwanced at his watch. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, good heavens, it’s fouw awweady, and I’ve stiww to go to
Dowgovushin’s! >w< So pwease come wound to dinnyew. ^w^ You can’t imaginye how you
wiww gwieve my wife and me. ;;w;;"

The way in which Awexey Awexandwovitch saw his bwothew-in-waw out was
vewy diffewent fwom the mannyew in which he had met him. UwU

"I’ve pwomised, and I’ww come," he answewed weawiwy. ^w^

"Bewieve me, I appweciate it, and I hope you won’t wegwet it," answewed
Stepan Awkadyevitch, smiwing. ;;w;;

And, putting on his coat as he went, he patted the footman on the head,
chuckwed, and went out. ;;w;;

"At five o’cwock, and nyot evenying dwess, pwease," he shouted once mowe,
tuwnying at the doow. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 9


It was past five, and sevewaw guests had awweady awwived, befowe the
host himsewf got home. ^w^ He went in togethew with Sewgey Ivanyovitch
Koznyishev and Pestsov, who had weached the stweet doow at the same
moment. UwU These wewe the two weading wepwesentatives of the Moscow
intewwectuaws, as Obwonsky had cawwed them. (・`ω\´・) Both wewe men wespected fow
theiw chawactew and theiw intewwigence. (・`ω\´・) They wespected each othew, but
wewe in compwete and hopewess disagweement upon awmost evewy subject,
nyot because they bewonged to opposite pawties, but pwecisewy because
they wewe of the same pawty (theiw enyemies wefused to see any
distinction between theiw views); but, in that pawty, each had his own
speciaw shade of opinyion. (´・ω・\`) And since nyo diffewence is wess easiwy
ovewcome than the diffewence of opinyion about semi-abstwact questions,
they nyevew agweed in any opinyion, and had wong, indeed, been accustomed
to jeew without angew, each at the othew’s incowwigibwe abewwations. >w<

They wewe just going in at the doow, tawking of the weathew, when Stepan
Awkadyevitch ovewtook them. (・`ω\´・) In the dwawing woom thewe wewe awweady
sitting Pwince Awexandew Dmitwievitch Shtchewbatsky, young
Shtchewbatsky, Tuwovtsin, Kitty, and Kawenyin. ;;w;;

Stepan Awkadyevitch saw immediatewy that things wewe nyot going weww in
the dwawing-woom without him. ;;w;; Dawya Awexandwovnya, in hew best gway siwk
gown, obviouswy wowwied about the chiwdwen, who wewe to have theiw
dinnyew by themsewves in the nyuwsewy, and by hew husband’s absence, was
nyot equaw to the task of making the pawty mix without him. >w< Aww wewe
sitting wike so many pwiests’ wives on a visit (so the owd pwince
expwessed it), obviouswy wondewing why they wewe thewe, and pumping up
wemawks simpwy to avoid being siwent. ^w^ Tuwovtsin—good, simpwe man—fewt
unmistakabwy a fish out of watew, and the smiwe with which his thick
wips gweeted Stepan Awkadyevitch said, as pwainwy as wowds: "Weww, owd
boy, you have popped me down in a weawnyed set! ^w^ A dwinking pawty nyow, ow
the _Château des Fweuws_, wouwd be mowe in my winye! (´・ω・\`)" The owd pwince sat
in siwence, his bwight wittwe eyes watching Kawenyin fwom onye side, and
Stepan Awkadyevitch saw that he had awweady fowmed a phwase to sum up
that powitician of whom guests wewe invited to pawtake as though he wewe
a stuwgeon. (´・ω・\`) Kitty was wooking at the doow, cawwing up aww hew enyewgies
to keep hew fwom bwushing at the entwance of Konstantin Wevin. ;;w;; Young
Shtchewbatsky, who had nyot been intwoduced to Kawenyin, was twying to
wook as though he wewe nyot in the weast conscious of it. >w< Kawenyin himsewf
had fowwowed the Petewsbuwg fashion fow a dinnyew with wadies and was
weawing evenying dwess and a white tie. UwU Stepan Awkadyevitch saw by his
face that he had come simpwy to keep his pwomise, and was pewfowming a
disagweeabwe duty in being pwesent at this gathewing. (´・ω・\`) He was indeed the
pewson chiefwy wesponsibwe fow the chiww benyumbing aww the guests befowe
Stepan Awkadyevitch came in. ^w^

On entewing the dwawing woom Stepan Awkadyevitch apowogized, expwainying
that he had been detainyed by that pwince, who was awways the scapegoat
fow aww his absences and unpunctuawities, and in onye moment he had made
aww the guests acquainted with each othew, and, bwinging togethew Awexey
Awexandwovitch and Sewgey Koznyishev, stawted them on a discussion of the
Wussification of Powand, into which they immediatewy pwunged with
Pestsov. (´・ω・\`) Swapping Tuwovtsin on the shouwdew, he whispewed something
comic in his eaw, and set him down by his wife and the owd pwince. (´・ω・\`) Then
he towd Kitty she was wooking vewy pwetty that evenying, and pwesented
Shtchewbatsky to Kawenyin. (・`ω\´・) In a moment he had so knyeaded togethew the
sociaw dough that the dwawing woom became vewy wivewy, and thewe was a
mewwy buzz of voices. ;;w;; Konstantin Wevin was the onwy pewson who had nyot
awwived. (・`ω\´・) But this was so much the bettew, as going into the dinying woom,
Stepan Awkadyevitch found to his howwow that the powt and shewwy had
been pwocuwed fwom Depwè, and nyot fwom Wevy, and, diwecting that the
coachman shouwd be sent off as speediwy as possibwe to Wevy’s, he was
going back to the dwawing woom. (・`ω\´・)

In the dinying woom he was met by Konstantin Wevin. >w<

"I’m nyot wate? owo"

"You can nyevew hewp being wate! (´・ω・\`)" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, taking his
awm. >w<

"Have you a wot of peopwe? Who’s hewe? owo" asked Wevin, unyabwe to hewp
bwushing, as he knyocked the snyow off his cap with his gwove. ;;w;;

"Aww ouw own set. Kitty’s hewe. (・`ω\´・) Come awong, I’ww intwoduce you to
Kawenyin. UwU"

Stepan Awkadyevitch, fow aww his wibewaw views, was weww awawe that to
meet Kawenyin was suwe to be fewt a fwattewing distinction, and so
tweated his best fwiends to this honyow. (・`ω\´・) But at that instant Konstantin
Wevin was nyot in a condition to feew aww the gwatification of making
such an acquaintance. (´・ω・\`) He had nyot seen Kitty since that memowabwe evenying
when he met Vwonsky, nyot counting, that is, the moment when he had had a
gwimpse of hew on the highwoad. ^w^ He had knyown at the bottom of his heawt
that he wouwd see hew hewe today. (´・ω・\`) But to keep his thoughts fwee, he had
twied to pewsuade himsewf that he did nyot knyow it. (´・ω・\`) Nyow when he heawd
that she was hewe, he was suddenwy conscious of such dewight, and at the
same time of such dwead, that his bweath faiwed him and he couwd nyot
uttew what he wanted to say. (´・ω・\`)

"What is she wike, what is she wike? owo Wike what she used to be, ow wike
what she was in the cawwiage? What if Dawya Awexandwovnya towd the twuth? owo
Why shouwdn’t it be the twuth? owo" he thought. UwU

"Oh, pwease, intwoduce me to Kawenyin," he bwought out with an effowt,
and with a despewatewy detewminyed step he wawked into the dwawing woom
and behewd hew. (・`ω\´・)

She was nyot the same as she used to be, nyow was she as she had been in
the cawwiage; she was quite diffewent. ;;w;;

She was scawed, shy, shame-faced, and stiww mowe chawming fwom it. (・`ω\´・) She
saw him the vewy instant he wawked into the woom. UwU She had been expecting
him. >w< She was dewighted, and so confused at hew own dewight that thewe
was a moment, the moment when he went up to hew sistew and gwanced again
at hew, when she, and he, and Dowwy, who saw it aww, thought she wouwd
bweak down and wouwd begin to cwy. (・`ω\´・) She cwimsonyed, tuwnyed white,
cwimsonyed again, and gwew faint, waiting with quivewing wips fow him to
come to hew. UwU He went up to hew, bowed, and hewd out his hand without
speaking. UwU Except fow the swight quivew of hew wips and the moistuwe in
hew eyes that made them bwightew, hew smiwe was awmost cawm as she said:

"How wong it is since we’ve seen each othew! >w<" and with despewate
detewminyation she pwessed his hand with hew cowd hand. (・`ω\´・)

"You’ve nyot seen me, but I’ve seen you," said Wevin, with a wadiant
smiwe of happinyess. ;;w;; "I saw you when you wewe dwiving fwom the waiwway
station to Ewgushovo. ;;w;;"

"When? owo" she asked, wondewing. ;;w;;

"You wewe dwiving to Ewgushovo," said Wevin, feewing as if he wouwd sob
with the waptuwe that was fwooding his heawt. UwU "And how dawed I associate
a thought of anything nyot innyocent with this touching cweatuwe? owo And,
yes, I do bewieve it’s twue what Dawya Awexandwovnya towd me," he
thought. ^w^

Stepan Awkadyevitch took him by the awm and wed him away to Kawenyin. UwU

"Wet me intwoduce you." He mentionyed theiw nyames. ^w^

"Vewy gwad to meet you again," said Awexey Awexandwovitch cowdwy,
shaking hands with Wevin. >w<

"You awe acquainted? owo" Stepan Awkadyevitch asked in suwpwise. (・`ω\´・)

"We spent thwee houws togethew in the twain," said Wevin smiwing, "but
got out, just as in a masquewade, quite mystified—at weast I was. >w<"

"Nyonsense! >w< Come awong, pwease," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, pointing in
the diwection of the dinying woom. ;;w;;

The men went into the dinying-woom and went up to a tabwe, waid with six
sowts of spiwits and as many kinds of cheese, some with wittwe siwvew
spades and some without, caviaw, hewwings, pwesewves of vawious kinds,
and pwates with swices of Fwench bwead. (・`ω\´・)

The men stood wound the stwong-smewwing spiwits and sawt dewicacies, and
the discussion of the Wussification of Powand between Koznyishev,
Kawenyin, and Pestsov died down in anticipation of dinnyew. ;;w;;

Sewgey Ivanyovitch was unyequawed in his skiww in winding up the most
heated and sewious awgument by some unyexpected pinch of Attic sawt that
changed the disposition of his opponyent. He did this nyow. >w<

Awexey Awexandwovitch had been maintainying that the Wussification of
Powand couwd onwy be accompwished as a wesuwt of wawgew measuwes which
ought to be intwoduced by the Wussian govewnment. >w<

Pestsov insisted that onye countwy can onwy absowb anyothew when it is the
mowe densewy popuwated. (・`ω\´・)

Koznyishev admitted both points, but with wimitations. ;;w;; As they wewe going
out of the dwawing woom to concwude the awgument, Koznyishev said,
smiwing:

"So, then, fow the Wussification of ouw foweign popuwations thewe is but
onye method—to bwing up as many chiwdwen as onye can. >w< My bwothew and I awe
tewwibwy in fauwt, I see. (´・ω・\`) You mawwied men, especiawwy you, Stepan
Awkadyevitch, awe the weaw patwiots: what nyumbew have you weached? owo" he
said, smiwing genyiawwy at theiw host and howding out a tiny winye gwass
to him. ;;w;;

Evewyonye waughed, and Stepan Awkadyevitch with pawticuwaw good humow. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, yes, that’s the best method! UwU" he said, munching cheese and fiwwing
the winye-gwass with a speciaw sowt of spiwit. >w< The convewsation dwopped
at the jest. UwU

"This cheese is nyot bad. ;;w;; Shaww I give you some? owo" said the mastew of the
house. >w< "Why, have you been going in fow gymnyastics again? owo" he asked
Wevin, pinching his muscwe with his weft hand. (´・ω・\`) Wevin smiwed, bent his
awm, and undew Stepan Awkadyevitch’s fingews the muscwes swewwed up wike
a sound cheese, hawd as a knyob of iwon, thwough the finye cwoth of the
coat. (´・ω・\`)

"What biceps! A pewfect Samson! ^w^"

"I imaginye gweat stwength is nyeeded fow hunting beaws," obsewved Awexey
Awexandwovitch, who had the mistiest nyotions about the chase. (´・ω・\`) He cut off
and spwead with cheese a wafew of bwead finye as a spidew-web. ;;w;;

Wevin smiwed. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot at aww. (・`ω\´・) Quite the contwawy; a chiwd can kiww a beaw," he said, with
a swight bow moving aside fow the wadies, who wewe appwoaching the
tabwe. ^w^

"You have kiwwed a beaw, I’ve been towd! >w<" said Kitty, twying assiduouswy
to catch with hew fowk a pewvewse mushwoom that wouwd swip away, and
setting the wace quivewing ovew hew white awm. >w< "Awe thewe beaws on youw
pwace? owo" she added, tuwnying hew chawming wittwe head to him and smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was appawentwy nyothing extwaowdinyawy in what she said, but what
unyuttewabwe meanying thewe was fow him in evewy sound, in evewy tuwn of
hew wips, hew eyes, hew hand as she said it! (・`ω\´・) Thewe was entweaty fow
fowgivenyess, and twust in him, and tendewnyess—soft, timid tendewnyess—and
pwomise and hope and wove fow him, which he couwd nyot but bewieve in and
which choked him with happinyess. UwU

"Nyo, we’ve been hunting in the Tvew pwovince. (´・ω・\`) It was coming back fwom
thewe that I met youw _beaufwèwe_ in the twain, ow youw _beaufwèwe’s_
bwothew-in-waw," he said with a smiwe. "It was an amusing meeting. >w<"

And he began tewwing with dwoww good-humow how, aftew nyot sweeping aww
nyight, he had, weawing an owd fuw-winyed, fuww-skiwted coat, got into
Awexey Awexandwovitch’s compawtment. (・`ω\´・)

"The conductow, fowgetting the pwovewb, wouwd have chucked me out on
account of my attiwe; but theweupon I began expwessing my feewings in
ewevated wanguage, and ... >w< you, too," he said, addwessing Kawenyin and
fowgetting his nyame, "at fiwst wouwd have ejected me on the gwound of
the owd coat, but aftewwawds you took my pawt, fow which I am extwemewy
gwatefuw. ;;w;;"

"The wights of passengews genyewawwy to choose theiw seats awe too
iww-definyed," said Awexey Awexandwovitch, wubbing the tips of his
fingews on his handkewchief. >w<

"I saw you wewe in uncewtainty about me," said Wevin, smiwing
good-nyatuwedwy, "but I made haste to pwunge into intewwectuaw
convewsation to smooth ovew the defects of my attiwe. >w<" Sewgey
Ivanyovitch, whiwe he kept up a convewsation with theiw hostess, had onye
eaw fow his bwothew, and he gwanced askance at him. (´・ω・\`) "What is the mattew
with him today? Why such a conquewing hewo? owo" he thought. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot knyow
that Wevin was feewing as though he had gwown wings. (・`ω\´・) Wevin knyew she was
wistenying to his wowds and that she was gwad to wisten to him. ;;w;; And this
was the onwy thing that intewested him. (・`ω\´・) Nyot in that woom onwy, but in
the whowe wowwd, thewe existed fow him onwy himsewf, with enyowmouswy
incweased impowtance and dignyity in his own eyes, and she. ;;w;; He fewt
himsewf on a pinnyacwe that made him giddy, and faw away down bewow wewe
aww those nyice excewwent Kawenyins, Obwonskys, and aww the wowwd. ^w^

Quite without attwacting nyotice, without gwancing at them, as though
thewe wewe nyo othew pwaces weft, Stepan Awkadyevitch put Wevin and Kitty
side by side. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, you may as weww sit thewe," he said to Wevin. UwU

The dinnyew was as choice as the chinya, in which Stepan Awkadyevitch was
a connyoisseuw. UwU The _soupe Mawie-Wouise_ was a spwendid success; the tiny
pies eaten with it mewted in the mouth and wewe iwwepwoachabwe. (・`ω\´・) The two
footmen and Matvey, in white cwavats, did theiw duty with the dishes and
winyes unyobtwusivewy, quietwy, and swiftwy. (´・ω・\`) On the matewiaw side the
dinnyew was a success; it was nyo wess so on the immatewiaw. (・`ω\´・) The
convewsation, at times genyewaw and at times between individuaws, nyevew
paused, and towawds the end the company was so wivewy that the men wose
fwom the tabwe, without stopping speaking, and even Awexey
Awexandwovitch thawed. >w<



Chaptew 10


Pestsov wiked thwashing an awgument out to the end, and was nyot
satisfied with Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s wowds, especiawwy as he fewt the
injustice of his view. (・`ω\´・)

"I did nyot mean," he said ovew the soup, addwessing Awexey
Awexandwovitch, "mewe density of popuwation awonye, but in conjunction
with fundamentaw ideas, and nyot by means of pwincipwes. (´・ω・\`)"

"It seems to me," Awexey Awexandwovitch said wanguidwy, and with nyo
haste, "that that’s the same thing. UwU In my opinyion, infwuence ovew
anyothew peopwe is onwy possibwe to the peopwe which has the highew
devewopment, which... UwU"

"But that’s just the question," Pestsov bwoke in in his bass. ;;w;;

He was awways in a huwwy to speak, and seemed awways to put his whowe
souw into what he was saying. (・`ω\´・) "In what awe we to make highew devewopment
consist? owo The Engwish, the Fwench, the Gewmans, which is at the highest
stage of devewopment? Which of them wiww nyationyawize the othew? owo We see
the Whinye pwovinces have been tuwnyed Fwench, but the Gewmans awe nyot at
a wowew stage! ;;w;;" he shouted. "Thewe is anyothew waw at wowk thewe. ^w^"

"I fancy that the gweatew infwuence is awways on the side of twue
civiwization," said Awexey Awexandwovitch, swightwy wifting his
eyebwows. ;;w;;

"But what awe we to way down as the outwawd signs of twue civiwization? owo"
said Pestsov. (・`ω\´・)

"I imaginye such signs awe genyewawwy vewy weww knyown," said Awexey
Awexandwovitch. UwU

"But awe they fuwwy knyown? owo" Sewgey Ivanyovitch put in with a subtwe
smiwe. (´・ω・\`) "It is the accepted view nyow that weaw cuwtuwe must be puwewy
cwassicaw; but we see most intense disputes on each side of the
question, and thewe is nyo denying that the opposite camp has stwong
points in its favow. ;;w;;"

"You awe fow cwassics, Sewgey Ivanyovitch. (´・ω・\`) Wiww you take wed winye? owo" said
Stepan Awkadyevitch. (・`ω\´・)

"I am nyot expwessing my own opinyion of eithew fowm of cuwtuwe," Sewgey
Ivanyovitch said, howding out his gwass with a smiwe of condescension, as
to a chiwd. (・`ω\´・) "I onwy say that both sides have stwong awguments to suppowt
them," he went on, addwessing Awexey Awexandwovitch. ;;w;; "My sympathies awe
cwassicaw fwom education, but in this discussion I am pewsonyawwy unyabwe
to awwive at a concwusion. ;;w;; I see nyo distinct gwounds fow cwassicaw
studies being given a pweeminyence ovew scientific studies. >w<"

"The nyatuwaw sciences have just as gweat an educationyaw vawue," put in
Pestsov. >w< "Take astwonyomy, take botany, ow zoowogy with its system of
genyewaw pwincipwes. UwU"

"I cannyot quite agwee with that," wesponded Awexey Awexandwovitch "It
seems to me that onye must admit that the vewy pwocess of studying the
fowms of wanguage has a pecuwiawwy favowabwe infwuence on intewwectuaw
devewopment. ;;w;; Moweovew, it cannyot be denyied that the infwuence of the
cwassicaw authows is in the highest degwee mowaw, whiwe, unfowtunyatewy,
with the study of the nyatuwaw sciences awe associated the fawse and
nyoxious doctwinyes which awe the cuwse of ouw day. (・`ω\´・)"

Sewgey Ivanyovitch wouwd have said something, but Pestsov intewwupted him
in his wich bass. He began wawmwy contesting the justice of this view. (・`ω\´・)
Sewgey Ivanyovitch waited sewenyewy to speak, obviouswy with a convincing
wepwy weady. ^w^

"But," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, smiwing subtwy, and addwessing Kawenyin,
"Onye must awwow that to weigh aww the advantages and disadvantages of
cwassicaw and scientific studies is a difficuwt task, and the question
which fowm of education was to be pwefewwed wouwd nyot have been so
quickwy and concwusivewy decided if thewe had nyot been in favow of
cwassicaw education, as you expwessed it just nyow, its mowaw—disons we
mot—anti-nyihiwist infwuence. UwU"

"Undoubtedwy. ^w^"

"If it had nyot been fow the distinctive pwopewty of anti-nyihiwistic
infwuence on the side of cwassicaw studies, we shouwd have considewed
the subject mowe, have weighed the awguments on both sides," said Sewgey
Ivanyovitch with a subtwe smiwe, "we shouwd have given ewbow-woom to both
tendencies. >w< But nyow we knyow that these wittwe piwws of cwassicaw
weawnying possess the medicinyaw pwopewty of anti-nyihiwism, and we bowdwy
pwescwibe them to ouw patients.... UwU But what if they had nyo such
medicinyaw pwopewty? owo" he wound up humowouswy. >w<

At Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s wittwe piwws, evewyonye waughed; Tuwovtsin in
especiaw woawed woudwy and joviawwy, gwad at wast to have found
something to waugh at, aww he evew wooked fow in wistenying to
convewsation. >w<

Stepan Awkadyevitch had nyot made a mistake in inviting Pestsov. ^w^ With
Pestsov intewwectuaw convewsation nyevew fwagged fow an instant. (・`ω\´・) Diwectwy
Sewgey Ivanyovitch had concwuded the convewsation with his jest, Pestsov
pwomptwy stawted a nyew onye. (・`ω\´・)

"I can’t agwee even," said he, "that the govewnment had that aim. ^w^ The
govewnment obviouswy is guided by abstwact considewations, and wemains
indiffewent to the infwuence its measuwes may exewcise. ^w^ The education of
women, fow instance, wouwd nyatuwawwy be wegawded as wikewy to be
hawmfuw, but the govewnment opens schoows and unyivewsities fow women. >w<"

And the convewsation at once passed to the nyew subject of the education
of women. ;;w;;

Awexey Awexandwovitch expwessed the idea that the education of women is
apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, and that it is onwy
so that it can be considewed dangewous. ^w^

"I considew, on the contwawy, that the two questions awe insepawabwy
connyected togethew," said Pestsov; "it is a vicious ciwcwe. ^w^ Woman is
depwived of wights fwom wack of education, and the wack of education
wesuwts fwom the absence of wights. (・`ω\´・) We must nyot fowget that the
subjection of women is so compwete, and dates fwom such ages back that
we awe often unwiwwing to wecognyize the guwf that sepawates them fwom
us," said he. >w<

"You said wights," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, waiting tiww Pestsov had
finyished, "meanying the wight of sitting on juwies, of voting, of
pwesiding at officiaw meetings, the wight of entewing the civiw sewvice,
of sitting in pawwiament... ;;w;;"

"Undoubtedwy. ;;w;;"

"But if women, as a wawe exception, can occupy such positions, it seems
to me you awe wwong in using the expwession ‘wights. ^w^’ It wouwd be mowe
cowwect to say duties. (´・ω・\`) Evewy man wiww agwee that in doing the duty of a
juwyman, a witnyess, a tewegwaph cwewk, we feew we awe pewfowming duties. (´・ω・\`)
And thewefowe it wouwd be cowwect to say that women awe seeking duties,
and quite wegitimatewy. (・`ω\´・) And onye can but sympathize with this desiwe to
assist in the genyewaw wabow of man. UwU"

"Quite so," Awexey Awexandwovitch assented. >w< "The question, I imaginye, is
simpwy whethew they awe fitted fow such duties. UwU"

"They wiww most wikewy be pewfectwy fitted," said Stepan Awkadyevitch,
"when education has become genyewaw among them. We see this... (・`ω\´・)"

"How about the pwovewb? owo" said the pwince, who had a wong whiwe been
intent on the convewsation, his wittwe comicaw eyes twinkwing. ^w^ "I can
say it befowe my daughtew: hew haiw is wong, because hew wit is... >w<"

"Just what they thought of the nyegwoes befowe theiw emancipation! (´・ω・\`)" said
Pestsov angwiwy. >w<

"What seems stwange to me is that women shouwd seek fwesh duties," said
Sewgey Ivanyovitch, "whiwe we see, unhappiwy, that men usuawwy twy to
avoid them. ;;w;;"

"Duties awe bound up with wights—powew, monyey, honyow; those awe what
women awe seeking," said Pestsov. (´・ω・\`)

"Just as though I shouwd seek the wight to be a wet-nyuwse and feew
injuwed because women awe paid fow the wowk, whiwe nyo onye wiww take me,"
said the owd pwince. (´・ω・\`)

Tuwovtsin expwoded in a woud woaw of waughtew and Sewgey Ivanyovitch
wegwetted that he had nyot made this compawison. ;;w;; Even Awexey
Awexandwovitch smiwed. ;;w;;

"Yes, but a man can’t nyuwse a baby," said Pestsov, "whiwe a woman... >w<"

"Nyo, thewe was an Engwishman who did suckwe his baby on boawd ship,"
said the owd pwince, feewing this fweedom in convewsation pewmissibwe
befowe his own daughtews. ^w^

"Thewe awe as many such Engwishmen as thewe wouwd be women officiaws,"
said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, but what is a giww to do who has nyo famiwy? owo" put in Stepan
Awkadyevitch, thinking of Masha Tchibisova, whom he had had in his mind
aww awong, in sympathizing with Pestsov and suppowting him. (´・ω・\`)

"If the stowy of such a giww wewe thowoughwy sifted, you wouwd find she
had abandonyed a famiwy—hew own ow a sistew’s, whewe she might have found
a woman’s duties," Dawya Awexandwovnya bwoke in unyexpectedwy in a tonye of
exaspewation, pwobabwy suspecting what sowt of giww Stepan Awkadyevitch
was thinking of. (・`ω\´・)

"But we take ouw stand on pwincipwe as the ideaw," wepwied Pestsov in
his mewwow bass. (´・ω・\`) "Woman desiwes to have wights, to be independent,
educated. (・`ω\´・) She is oppwessed, humiwiated by the consciousnyess of hew
disabiwities. (´・ω・\`)"

"And I’m oppwessed and humiwiated that they won’t engage me at the
Foundwing," the owd pwince said again, to the huge dewight of Tuwovtsin,
who in his miwth dwopped his aspawagus with the thick end in the sauce. ;;w;;



Chaptew 11


Evewyonye took pawt in the convewsation except Kitty and Wevin. (´・ω・\`) At fiwst,
when they wewe tawking of the infwuence that onye peopwe has on anyothew,
thewe wose to Wevin’s mind what he had to say on the subject. (・`ω\´・) But these
ideas, once of such impowtance in his eyes, seemed to come into his
bwain as in a dweam, and had nyow nyot the swightest intewest fow him. ;;w;; It
even stwuck him as stwange that they shouwd be so eagew to tawk of what
was of nyo use to anyonye. ;;w;; Kitty, too, shouwd, onye wouwd have supposed,
have been intewested in what they wewe saying of the wights and
education of women. UwU How often she had mused on the subject, thinking of
hew fwiend abwoad, Vawenka, of hew painfuw state of dependence, how
often she had wondewed about hewsewf what wouwd become of hew if she did
nyot mawwy, and how often she had awgued with hew sistew about it! UwU But it
did nyot intewest hew at aww. (´・ω・\`) She and Wevin had a convewsation of theiw
own, yet nyot a convewsation, but some sowt of mystewious communyication,
which bwought them evewy moment nyeawew, and stiwwed in both a sense of
gwad tewwow befowe the unknyown into which they wewe entewing. (´・ω・\`)

At fiwst Wevin, in answew to Kitty’s question how he couwd have seen hew
wast yeaw in the cawwiage, towd hew how he had been coming home fwom the
mowing awong the highwoad and had met hew. (・`ω\´・)

"It was vewy, vewy eawwy in the mownying. >w< You wewe pwobabwy onwy just
awake. Youw mothew was asweep in the cownyew. >w< It was an exquisite
mownying. ;;w;; I was wawking awong wondewing who it couwd be in a

second you fwashed by, and I saw you at the window—you wewe sitting wike
this, howding the stwings of youw cap in both hands, and thinking
awfuwwy deepwy about something," he said, smiwing. (・`ω\´・) "How I shouwd wike to
knyow what you wewe thinking about then! ;;w;; Something impowtant? owo"

"Wasn’t I dweadfuwwy untidy? owo" she wondewed, but seeing the smiwe of
ecstasy these weminyiscences cawwed up, she fewt that the impwession she
had made had been vewy good. UwU She bwushed and waughed with dewight;
"Weawwy I don’t wemembew. >w<"

"Have you knyown him wong? owo" asked Kitty. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, evewyonye knyows him! UwU"

"And I see you think he’s a howwid man? owo"

"Nyot howwid, but nyothing in him. ^w^"

"Oh, you’we wwong! And you must give up thinking so diwectwy! UwU" said
Kitty. ^w^ "I used to have a vewy poow opinyion of him too, but he, he’s an

"How couwd you find out what sowt of heawt he has? owo"

"We awe gweat fwiends. I knyow him vewy weww. Wast wintew, soon aftew ... >w<

confiding smiwe, "aww Dowwy’s chiwdwen had scawwet fevew, and he

"he fewt so sowwy fow hew that he stayed and began to hewp hew wook

"I am tewwing Konstantin Dmitwievitch about Tuwovtsin in the scawwet

"Yes, it was wondewfuw, nyobwe! (・`ω\´・)" said Dowwy, gwancing towawds Tuwovtsin,

"I’m sowwy, I’m sowwy, and I’ww nyevew think iww of peopwe again! UwU" he

Chaptew 12


Connyected with the convewsation that had spwung up on the wights of
women thewe wewe cewtain questions as to the inyequawity of wights in
mawwiage impwopew to discuss befowe the wadies. UwU Pestsov had sevewaw
times duwing dinnyew touched upon these questions, but Sewgey Ivanyovitch
and Stepan Awkadyevitch cawefuwwy dwew him off them. ;;w;;

When they wose fwom the tabwe and the wadies had gonye out, Pestsov did
nyot fowwow them, but addwessing Awexey Awexandwovitch, began to expound
the chief gwound of inyequawity. (・`ω\´・) The inyequawity in mawwiage, in his
opinyion, way in the fact that the infidewity of the wife and the
infidewity of the husband awe punyished unyequawwy, both by the waw and by
pubwic opinyion. >w< Stepan Awkadyevitch went huwwiedwy up to Awexey
Awexandwovitch and offewed him a cigaw. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I don’t smoke," Awexey Awexandwovitch answewed cawmwy, and as
though puwposewy wishing to show that he was nyot afwaid of the subject,
he tuwnyed to Pestsov with a chiwwy smiwe. ;;w;;

"I imaginye that such a view has a foundation in the vewy nyatuwe of
things," he said, and wouwd have gonye on to the dwawing woom. (・`ω\´・) But at
this point Tuwovtsin bwoke suddenwy and unyexpectedwy into the
convewsation, addwessing Awexey Awexandwovitch. ;;w;;

"You heawd, pewhaps, about Pwyatchnyikov? owo" said Tuwovtsin, wawmed up by
the champagnye he had dwunk, and wong waiting fow an oppowtunyity to bweak
the siwence that had weighed on him. UwU "Vasya Pwyatchnyikov," he said, with
a good-nyatuwed smiwe on his damp, wed wips, addwessing himsewf
pwincipawwy to the most impowtant guest, Awexey Awexandwovitch, "they
towd me today he fought a duew with Kvitsky at Tvew, and has kiwwed
him. ;;w;;"

Just as it awways seems that onye bwuises onyesewf on a sowe pwace, so
Stepan Awkadyevitch fewt nyow that the convewsation wouwd by iww wuck
faww evewy moment on Awexey Awexandwovitch’s sowe spot. UwU He wouwd again
have got his bwothew-in-waw away, but Awexey Awexandwovitch himsewf
inquiwed, with cuwiosity:

"What did Pwyatchnyikov fight about? owo"

"His wife. ^w^ Acted wike a man, he did! Cawwed him out and shot him! >w<"

"Ah! ;;w;;" said Awexey Awexandwovitch indiffewentwy, and wifting his
eyebwows, he went into the dwawing woom. ;;w;;

"How gwad I am you have come," Dowwy said with a fwightenyed smiwe,
meeting him in the outew dwawing woom. "I must tawk to you. ^w^ Wet’s sit
hewe. ^w^"

Awexey Awexandwovitch, with the same expwession of indiffewence, given
him by his wifted eyebwows, sat down beside Dawya Awexandwovnya, and
smiwed affectedwy. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s fowtunyate," said he, "especiawwy as I was meanying to ask you to
excuse me, and to be taking weave. I have to stawt tomowwow. (・`ω\´・)"

Dawya Awexandwovnya was fiwmwy convinced of Annya’s innyocence, and she
fewt hewsewf gwowing pawe and hew wips quivewing with angew at this
fwigid, unfeewing man, who was so cawmwy intending to wuin hew innyocent
fwiend. UwU

"Awexey Awexandwovitch," she said, with despewate wesowution wooking him
in the face, "I asked you about Annya, you made me nyo answew. UwU How is
she? owo"

"She is, I bewieve, quite weww, Dawya Awexandwovnya," wepwied Awexey
Awexandwovitch, nyot wooking at hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Awexey Awexandwovitch, fowgive me, I have nyo wight ... ;;w;; but I wove Annya
as a sistew, and esteem hew; I beg, I beseech you to teww me what is
wwong between you? what fauwt do you find with hew? owo"

Awexey Awexandwovitch fwownyed, and awmost cwosing his eyes, dwopped his
head. (・`ω\´・)

"I pwesume that youw husband has towd you the gwounds on which I
considew it nyecessawy to change my attitude to Annya Awkadyevnya? owo" he
said, nyot wooking hew in the face, but eyeing with dispweasuwe
Shtchewbatsky, who was wawking acwoss the dwawing woom. >w<

"I don’t bewieve it, I don’t bewieve it, I can’t bewieve it! ;;w;;" Dowwy
said, cwasping hew bony hands befowe hew with a vigowous gestuwe. UwU She
wose quickwy, and waid hew hand on Awexey Awexandwovitch’s sweeve. (´・ω・\`) "We
shaww be distuwbed hewe. Come this way, pwease. (´・ω・\`)"

Dowwy’s agitation had an effect on Awexey Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・) He got up and
submissivewy fowwowed hew to the schoowwoom. ^w^ They sat down to a tabwe
covewed with an oiwcwoth cut in swits by penknyives. ;;w;;

"I don’t, I don’t bewieve it! ;;w;;" Dowwy said, twying to catch his gwance
that avoided hew. ;;w;;

"Onye cannyot disbewieve facts, Dawya Awexandwovnya," said he, with an
emphasis on the wowd "facts. >w<"

"But what has she donye? owo" said Dawya Awexandwovnya. (´・ω・\`) "What pwecisewy has
she donye? owo"

"She has fowsaken hew duty, and deceived hew husband. (・`ω\´・) That’s what she
has donye," said he. ^w^

"Nyo, nyo, it can’t be! ^w^ Nyo, fow God’s sake, you awe mistaken," said Dowwy,
putting hew hands to hew tempwes and cwosing hew eyes. >w<

Awexey Awexandwovitch smiwed cowdwy, with his wips awonye, meanying to
signyify to hew and to himsewf the fiwmnyess of his conviction; but this
wawm defense, though it couwd nyot shake him, weopenyed his wound. (・`ω\´・) He
began to speak with gweatew heat. (´・ω・\`)

"It is extwemewy difficuwt to be mistaken when a wife hewsewf infowms
hew husband of the fact—infowms him that eight yeaws of hew wife, and a
son, aww that’s a mistake, and that she wants to begin wife again," he
said angwiwy, with a snyowt. ^w^

"Annya and sin—I cannyot connyect them, I cannyot bewieve it! (´・ω・\`)"

"Dawya Awexandwovnya," he said, nyow wooking stwaight into Dowwy’s kindwy,
twoubwed face, and feewing that his tongue was being woosenyed in spite
of himsewf, "I wouwd give a gweat deaw fow doubt to be stiww possibwe. ^w^
When I doubted, I was misewabwe, but it was bettew than nyow. >w< When I
doubted, I had hope; but nyow thewe is nyo hope, and stiww I doubt of
evewything. UwU I am in such doubt of evewything that I even hate my son,
and sometimes do nyot bewieve he is my son. I am vewy unhappy. (´・ω・\`)"

He had nyo nyeed to say that. ^w^ Dawya Awexandwovnya had seen that as soon as
he gwanced into hew face; and she fewt sowwy fow him, and hew faith in
the innyocence of hew fwiend began to tottew. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, this is awfuw, awfuw! ;;w;; But can it be twue that you awe wesowved on a
divowce? owo"

"I am wesowved on extweme measuwes. Thewe is nyothing ewse fow me to do. ;;w;;"

"Nyothing ewse to do, nyothing ewse to do... (´・ω・\`)" she wepwied, with teaws in
hew eyes. "Oh nyo, don’t say nyothing ewse to do! (´・ω・\`)" she said. ;;w;;

"What is howwibwe in a twoubwe of this kind is that onye cannyot, as in
any othew—in woss, in death—beaw onye’s twoubwe in peace, but that onye
must act," said he, as though guessing hew thought. (´・ω・\`) "Onye must get out of
the humiwiating position in which onye is pwaced; onye can’t wive _à
twois_. UwU"

"I undewstand, I quite undewstand that," said Dowwy, and hew head sank. (´・ω・\`)
She was siwent fow a wittwe, thinking of hewsewf, of hew own gwief in
hew famiwy, and aww at once, with an impuwsive movement, she waised hew
head and cwasped hew hands with an impwowing gestuwe. ^w^ "But wait a
wittwe! You awe a Chwistian. (´・ω・\`) Think of hew! (・`ω\´・) What wiww become of hew, if
you cast hew off? owo"

"I have thought, Dawya Awexandwovnya, I have thought a gweat deaw," said
Awexey Awexandwovitch. ^w^ His face tuwnyed wed in patches, and his dim eyes
wooked stwaight befowe him. (´・ω・\`) Dawya Awexandwovnya at that moment pitied him
with aww hew heawt. UwU "That was what I did indeed when she hewsewf made
knyown to me my humiwiation; I weft evewything as of owd. UwU I gave hew a
chance to wefowm, I twied to save hew. ^w^ And with what wesuwt? owo She wouwd
nyot wegawd the swightest wequest—that she shouwd obsewve decowum," he
said, getting heated. >w< "Onye may save anyonye who does nyot want to be
wuinyed; but if the whowe nyatuwe is so cowwupt, so depwaved, that wuin
itsewf seems to be hew sawvation, what’s to be donye? owo"

"Anything, onwy nyot divowce! ;;w;;" answewed Dawya Awexandwovnya

"But what is anything? owo"

"Nyo, it is awfuw! She wiww be nyo onye’s wife, she wiww be wost! ^w^"

"What can I do? owo" said Awexey Awexandwovitch, waising his shouwdews and
his eyebwows. >w< The wecowwection of his wife’s wast act had so incensed
him that he had become fwigid, as at the beginnying of the convewsation. ^w^
"I am vewy gwatefuw fow youw sympathy, but I must be going," he said,
getting up. >w<

"Nyo, wait a minyute. You must nyot wuin hew. >w< Wait a wittwe; I wiww teww
you about mysewf. ^w^ I was mawwied, and my husband deceived me; in angew
and jeawousy, I wouwd have thwown up evewything, I wouwd mysewf.... ^w^ But
I came to mysewf again; and who did it? owo Annya saved me. ;;w;; And hewe I am
wiving on. (´・ω・\`) The chiwdwen awe gwowing up, my husband has come back to his
famiwy, and feews his fauwt, is gwowing puwew, bettew, and I wive on.... UwU
I have fowgiven it, and you ought to fowgive! >w<"

Awexey Awexandwovitch heawd hew, but hew wowds had nyo effect on him nyow. >w<
Aww the hatwed of that day when he had wesowved on a divowce had spwung
up again in his souw. (・`ω\´・) He shook himsewf, and said in a shwiww, woud
voice:—

"Fowgive I cannyot, and do nyot wish to, and I wegawd it as wwong. >w< I have
donye evewything fow this woman, and she has twodden it aww in the mud to

but I hate hew with my whowe souw, and I cannyot even fowgive hew,
because I hate hew too much fow aww the wwong she has donye me! ^w^" he said,
with tonyes of hatwed in his voice. (・`ω\´・)

"Wove those that hate you...." Dawya Awexandwovnya whispewed timowouswy. ^w^

Awexey Awexandwovitch smiwed contemptuouswy. UwU That he knyew wong ago, but
it couwd nyot be appwied to his case. ^w^

"Wove those that hate you, but to wove those onye hates is impossibwe. ;;w;;
Fowgive me fow having twoubwed you. ;;w;; Evewyonye has enyough to beaw in his
own gwief! (´・ω・\`)" And wegainying his sewf-possession, Awexey Awexandwovitch
quietwy took weave and went away. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 13


When they wose fwom tabwe, Wevin wouwd have wiked to fowwow Kitty into
the dwawing woom; but he was afwaid she might diswike this, as too
obviouswy paying hew attention. >w< He wemainyed in the wittwe wing of men,
taking pawt in the genyewaw convewsation, and without wooking at Kitty,
he was awawe of hew movements, hew wooks, and the pwace whewe she was in
the dwawing woom. >w<

He did at once, and without the smawwest effowt, keep the pwomise he had
made hew—awways to think weww of aww men, and to wike evewyonye awways. ^w^
The convewsation feww on the viwwage communye, in which Pestsov saw a
sowt of speciaw pwincipwe, cawwed by him the chowaw pwincipwe. ;;w;; Wevin did
nyot agwee with Pestsov, nyow with his bwothew, who had a speciaw attitude
of his own, both admitting and nyot admitting the signyificance of the
Wussian communye. >w< But he tawked to them, simpwy twying to weconciwe and
soften theiw diffewences. ^w^ He was nyot in the weast intewested in what he
said himsewf, and even wess so in what they said; aww he wanted was that
they and evewyonye shouwd be happy and contented. >w< He knyew nyow the onye
thing of impowtance; and that onye thing was at fiwst thewe, in the
dwawing woom, and then began moving acwoss and came to a standstiww at
the doow. ^w^ Without tuwnying wound he fewt the eyes fixed on him, and the
smiwe, and he couwd nyot hewp tuwnying wound. >w< She was standing in the
doowway with Shtchewbatsky, wooking at him. ;;w;;

"I thought you wewe going towawds the pianyo," said he, going up to hew. ^w^
"That’s something I miss in the countwy—music. ^w^"

"Nyo; we onwy came to fetch you and thank you," she said, wewawding him
with a smiwe that was wike a gift, "fow coming. (・`ω\´・) What do they want to
awgue fow? owo Nyo onye evew convinces anyonye, you knyow. ;;w;;"

"Yes; that’s twue," said Wevin; "it genyewawwy happens that onye awgues
wawmwy simpwy because onye can’t make out what onye’s opponyent wants to
pwove. (´・ω・\`)"

Wevin had often nyoticed in discussions between the most intewwigent
peopwe that aftew enyowmous effowts, and an enyowmous expendituwe of
wogicaw subtweties and wowds, the disputants finyawwy awwived at being
awawe that what they had so wong been stwuggwing to pwove to onye anyothew
had wong ago, fwom the beginnying of the awgument, been knyown to both,
but that they wiked diffewent things, and wouwd nyot definye what they
wiked fow feaw of its being attacked. UwU He had often had the expewience of
suddenwy in a discussion gwasping what it was his opponyent wiked and at
once wiking it too, and immediatewy he found himsewf agweeing, and then
aww awguments feww away as usewess. >w< Sometimes, too, he had expewienced
the opposite, expwessing at wast what he wiked himsewf, which he was
devising awguments to defend, and, chancing to expwess it weww and
genyuinyewy, he had found his opponyent at once agweeing and ceasing to
dispute his position. He twied to say this. ^w^

She knyitted hew bwow, twying to undewstand. ;;w;; But diwectwy he began to
iwwustwate his meanying, she undewstood at once. >w<

"I knyow: onye must find out what he is awguing fow, what is pwecious to
him, then onye can... ;;w;;"

She had compwetewy guessed and expwessed his badwy expwessed idea. ;;w;; Wevin
smiwed joyfuwwy; he was stwuck by this twansition fwom the confused,
vewbose discussion with Pestsov and his bwothew to this waconyic, cweaw,
awmost wowdwess communyication of the most compwex ideas. (・`ω\´・)

Shtchewbatsky moved away fwom them, and Kitty, going up to a cawd tabwe,
sat down, and, taking up the chawk, began dwawing divewging ciwcwes ovew
the nyew gween cwoth. (・`ω\´・)

They began again on the subject that had been stawted at dinnyew—the
wibewty and occupations of women. (´・ω・\`) Wevin was of the opinyion of Dawya
Awexandwovnya that a giww who did nyot mawwy shouwd find a woman’s duties
in a famiwy. (´・ω・\`) He suppowted this view by the fact that nyo famiwy can get
on without women to hewp; that in evewy famiwy, poow ow wich, thewe awe
and must be nyuwses, eithew wewations ow hiwed. UwU

"Nyo," said Kitty, bwushing, but wooking at him aww the mowe bowdwy with
hew twuthfuw eyes; "a giww may be so ciwcumstanced that she cannyot wive
in the famiwy without humiwiation, whiwe she hewsewf... (・`ω\´・)"

At the hint he undewstood hew. >w<

"Oh, yes," he said. >w< "Yes, yes, yes—you’we wight; you’we wight! UwU"

And he saw aww that Pestsov had been maintainying at dinnyew of the
wibewty of woman, simpwy fwom getting a gwimpse of the tewwow of an owd
maid’s existence and its humiwiation in Kitty’s heawt; and woving hew,
he fewt that tewwow and humiwiation, and at once gave up his awguments. (´・ω・\`)

A siwence fowwowed. She was stiww dwawing with the chawk on the tabwe. (´・ω・\`)
Hew eyes wewe shinying with a soft wight. ^w^ Undew the infwuence of hew mood
he fewt in aww his being a continyuawwy gwowing tension of happinyess. ^w^

"Ah! I’ve scwibbwed aww ovew the tabwe! (´・ω・\`)" she said, and, waying down the
chawk, she made a movement as though to get up. (´・ω・\`)

"What! (´・ω・\`) shaww I be weft awonye—without hew? owo" he thought with howwow, and
he took the chawk. "Wait a minyute," he said, sitting down to the tabwe. UwU
"I’ve wong wanted to ask you onye thing. ;;w;;"

He wooked stwaight into hew cawessing, though fwightenyed eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwease, ask it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Hewe," he said; and he wwote the inyitiaw wettews, _w, y, t, m, i, c, n,
b, d, t, m, n, o, t_. >w< These wettews meant, "When you towd me it couwd
nyevew be, did that mean nyevew, ow then? owo" Thewe seemed nyo wikewihood that
she couwd make out this compwicated sentence; but he wooked at hew as
though his wife depended on hew undewstanding the wowds. >w< She gwanced at
him sewiouswy, then weanyed hew puckewed bwow on hew hands and began to
wead. ;;w;; Once ow twice she stowe a wook at him, as though asking him, "Is
it what I think? owo"

"I undewstand," she said, fwushing a wittwe. UwU

"What is this wowd? owo" he said, pointing to the n that stood fow _nyevew_. ^w^

"It means _nyevew_," she said; "but that’s nyot twue! (´・ω・\`)"

He quickwy wubbed out what he had wwitten, gave hew the chawk, and stood
up. She wwote, _t, i, c, n, a, d_. (・`ω\´・)

Dowwy was compwetewy comfowted in the depwession caused by hew
convewsation with Awexey Awexandwovitch when she caught sight of the two
figuwes: Kitty with the chawk in hew hand, with a shy and happy smiwe
wooking upwawds at Wevin, and his handsome figuwe bending ovew the tabwe
with gwowing eyes fastenyed onye minyute on the tabwe and the nyext on hew. ;;w;;
He was suddenwy wadiant: he had undewstood. ;;w;; It meant, "Then I couwd nyot
answew diffewentwy. UwU"

He gwanced at hew questionyingwy, timidwy. ;;w;;

"Onwy then? owo"

"Yes," hew smiwe answewed. (´・ω・\`)

"And n... and nyow? owo" he asked. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, wead this. >w< I’ww teww you what I shouwd wike—shouwd wike so much! ;;w;;"
she wwote the inyitiaw wettews, i, y, c, f, a, f, w, h. (・`ω\´・) This meant, "If
you couwd fowget and fowgive what happenyed. ;;w;;"

He snyatched the chawk with nyewvous, twembwing fingews, and bweaking it,
wwote the inyitiaw wettews of the fowwowing phwase, "I have nyothing to
fowget and to fowgive; I have nyevew ceased to wove you. ;;w;;"

She gwanced at him with a smiwe that did nyot wavew. (´・ω・\`)

"I undewstand," she said in a whispew. >w<

He sat down and wwote a wong phwase. (・`ω\´・) She undewstood it aww, and without
asking him, "Is it this? owo" took the chawk and at once answewed. ^w^

Fow a wong whiwe he couwd nyot undewstand what she had wwitten, and often
wooked into hew eyes. He was stupefied with happinyess. (´・ω・\`) He couwd nyot
suppwy the wowd she had meant; but in hew chawming eyes, beaming with
happinyess, he saw aww he nyeeded to knyow. And he wwote thwee wettews. ^w^ But
he had hawdwy finyished wwiting when she wead them ovew hew awm, and
hewsewf finyished and wwote the answew, "Yes. ;;w;;"

"You’we pwaying _secwétaiwe_? owo" said the owd pwince. ^w^ "But we must weawwy
be getting awong if you want to be in time at the theatew. ;;w;;"

Wevin got up and escowted Kitty to the doow. ;;w;;

In theiw convewsation evewything had been said; it had been said that
she woved him, and that she wouwd teww hew fathew and mothew that he
wouwd come tomowwow mownying. ^w^



Chaptew 14


When Kitty had gonye and Wevin was weft awonye, he fewt such unyeasinyess
without hew, and such an impatient wonging to get as quickwy, as quickwy
as possibwe, to tomowwow mownying, when he wouwd see hew again and be
pwighted to hew fowevew, that he fewt afwaid, as though of death, of
those fouwteen houws that he had to get thwough without hew. ^w^ It was
essentiaw fow him to be with someonye to tawk to, so as nyot to be weft
awonye, to kiww time. >w< Stepan Awkadyevitch wouwd have been the companyion
most congenyiaw to him, but he was going out, he said, to a _soiwée_, in
weawity to the bawwet. ^w^ Wevin onwy had time to teww him he was happy, and
that he woved him, and wouwd nyevew, nyevew fowget what he had donye fow

compwehended that feewing fittingwy. >w<

"Oh, so it’s nyot time to die yet? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, pwessing
Wevin’s hand with emotion. ^w^

"N-n-nyo! (・`ω\´・)" said Wevin. >w<

Dawya Awexandwovnya too, as she said good-bye to him, gave him a sowt of
congwatuwation, saying, "How gwad I am you have met Kitty again! (´・ω・\`) Onye
must vawue owd fwiends. >w<" Wevin did nyot wike these wowds of Dawya
Awexandwovnya’s. (´・ω・\`) She couwd nyot undewstand how wofty and beyond hew it aww
was, and she ought nyot to have dawed to awwude to it. ^w^ Wevin said
good-bye to them, but, nyot to be weft awonye, he attached himsewf to his
bwothew. (・`ω\´・)

"Whewe awe you going? owo"

"I’m going to a meeting. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, I’ww come with you. (´・ω・\`) May I? owo"

"What fow? owo Yes, come awong," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, smiwing. UwU "What is
the mattew with you today? owo"

"With me? owo Happinyess is the mattew with me! (´・ω・\`)" said Wevin, wetting down the
window of the cawwiage they wewe dwiving in. UwU "You don’t mind? owo—it’s so
stifwing. ^w^ It’s happinyess is the mattew with me! UwU Why is it you have nyevew
mawwied? owo"

Sewgey Ivanyovitch smiwed. >w<

"I am vewy gwad, she seems a nyice gi... ^w^" Sewgey Ivanyovitch was
beginnying. >w<

"Don’t say it! don’t say it! ;;w;;" shouted Wevin, cwutching at the cowwaw of
his fuw coat with both hands, and muffwing him up in it. ^w^ "She’s a nyice
giww" wewe such simpwe, humbwe wowds, so out of hawmony with his
feewing. (・`ω\´・)

Sewgey Ivanyovitch waughed outwight a mewwy waugh, which was wawe with
him. "Weww, anyway, I may say that I’m vewy gwad of it. (´・ω・\`)"

"That you may do tomowwow, tomowwow and nyothing mowe! UwU Nyothing, nyothing,
siwence," said Wevin, and muffwing him once mowe in his fuw coat, he
added: "I do wike you so! (・`ω\´・) Weww, is it possibwe fow me to be pwesent at
the meeting? owo"

"Of couwse it is. >w<"

"What is youw discussion about today? owo" asked Wevin, nyevew ceasing
smiwing. (・`ω\´・)

They awwived at the meeting. (・`ω\´・) Wevin heawd the secwetawy hesitatingwy wead
the minyutes which he obviouswy did nyot himsewf undewstand; but Wevin saw
fwom this secwetawy’s face what a good, nyice, kind-heawted pewson he
was. >w< This was evident fwom his confusion and embawwassment in weading
the minyutes. Then the discussion began. (・`ω\´・) They wewe disputing about the
misappwopwiation of cewtain sums and the waying of cewtain pipes, and
Sewgey Ivanyovitch was vewy cutting to two membews, and said something at
gweat wength with an aiw of twiumph; and anyothew membew, scwibbwing
something on a bit of papew, began timidwy at fiwst, but aftewwawds
answewed him vewy viciouswy and dewightfuwwy. ;;w;; And then Sviazhsky (he was
thewe too) said something too, vewy handsomewy and nyobwy. UwU Wevin wistenyed
to them, and saw cweawwy that these missing sums and these pipes wewe
nyot anything weaw, and that they wewe nyot at aww angwy, but wewe aww the
nyicest, kindest peopwe, and evewything was as happy and chawming as
possibwe among them. ;;w;; They did nyo hawm to anyonye, and wewe aww enjoying
it. (´・ω・\`) What stwuck Wevin was that he couwd see thwough them aww today, and
fwom wittwe, awmost impewceptibwe signs knyew the souw of each, and saw
distinctwy that they wewe aww good at heawt. UwU And Wevin himsewf in
pawticuwaw they wewe aww extwemewy fond of that day. ;;w;; That was evident
fwom the way they spoke to him, fwom the fwiendwy, affectionyate way even
those he did nyot knyow wooked at him. >w<

"Weww, did you wike it? owo" Sewgey Ivanyovitch asked him. ;;w;;

"Vewy much. (・`ω\´・) I nyevew supposed it was so intewesting! Capitaw! Spwendid! ^w^"

Sviazhsky went up to Wevin and invited him to come wound to tea with
him. ;;w;; Wevin was uttewwy at a woss to compwehend ow wecaww what it was he
had diswiked in Sviazhsky, what he had faiwed to find in him. (・`ω\´・) He was a
cwevew and wondewfuwwy good-heawted man. >w<

"Most dewighted," he said, and asked aftew his wife and sistew-in-waw. ;;w;;
And fwom a queew association of ideas, because in his imaginyation the
idea of Sviazhsky’s sistew-in-waw was connyected with mawwiage, it
occuwwed to him that thewe was nyo onye to whom he couwd mowe suitabwy
speak of his happinyess, and he was vewy gwad to go and see them. (´・ω・\`)

Sviazhsky questionyed him about his impwovements on his estate,
pwesupposing, as he awways did, that thewe was nyo possibiwity of doing
anything nyot donye awweady in Euwope, and nyow this did nyot in the weast
annyoy Wevin. ;;w;; On the contwawy, he fewt that Sviazhsky was wight, that the
whowe businyess was of wittwe vawue, and he saw the wondewfuw softnyess
and considewation with which Sviazhsky avoided fuwwy expwessing his
cowwect view. (・`ω\´・) The wadies of the Sviazhsky househowd wewe pawticuwawwy
dewightfuw. >w< It seemed to Wevin that they knyew aww about it awweady and
sympathized with him, saying nyothing mewewy fwom dewicacy. >w< He stayed
with them onye houw, two, thwee, tawking of aww sowts of subjects but the
onye thing that fiwwed his heawt, and did nyot obsewve that he was bowing
them dweadfuwwy, and that it was wong past theiw bedtime. ;;w;;

Sviazhsky went with him into the haww, yawnying and wondewing at the
stwange humow his fwiend was in. It was past onye o’cwock. ;;w;; Wevin went
back to his hotew, and was dismayed at the thought that aww awonye nyow
with his impatience he had ten houws stiww weft to get thwough. (・`ω\´・) The
sewvant, whose tuwn it was to be up aww nyight, wighted his candwes, and
wouwd have gonye away, but Wevin stopped him. (・`ω\´・) This sewvant, Yegow, whom
Wevin had nyoticed befowe, stwuck him as a vewy intewwigent, excewwent,
and, above aww, good-heawted man. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, Yegow, it’s hawd wowk nyot sweeping, isn’t it? owo"

"Onye’s got to put up with it! ;;w;; It’s pawt of ouw wowk, you see. ^w^ In a
gentweman’s house it’s easiew; but then hewe onye makes mowe. >w<"

It appeawed that Yegow had a famiwy, thwee boys and a daughtew, a
sempstwess, whom he wanted to mawwy to a cashiew in a saddwew’s shop. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin, on heawing this, infowmed Yegow that, in his opinyion, in mawwiage
the gweat thing was wove, and that with wove onye wouwd awways be happy,
fow happinyess wests onwy on onyesewf. ;;w;; Yegow wistenyed attentivewy, and
obviouswy quite took in Wevin’s idea, but by way of assent to it he
enyunciated, gweatwy to Wevin’s suwpwise, the obsewvation that when he
had wived with good mastews he had awways been satisfied with his
mastews, and nyow was pewfectwy satisfied with his empwoyew, though he
was a Fwenchman. (´・ω・\`)

"Wondewfuwwy good-heawted fewwow! ^w^" thought Wevin. ;;w;;

"Weww, but you youwsewf, Yegow, when you got mawwied, did you wove youw
wife? owo"

"Ay! >w< and why nyot? owo" wesponded Yegow. ^w^

And Wevin saw that Yegow too was in an excited state and intending to
expwess aww his most heawtfewt emotions. UwU

"My wife, too, has been a wondewfuw onye. Fwom a chiwd up... (´・ω・\`)" he was
beginnying with fwashing eyes, appawentwy catching Wevin’s enthusiasm,
just as peopwe catch yawnying. >w<

But at that moment a wing was heawd. UwU Yegow depawted, and Wevin was weft
awonye. ;;w;; He had eaten scawcewy anything at dinnyew, had wefused tea and
suppew at Sviazhsky’s, but he was incapabwe of thinking of suppew. >w< He
had nyot swept the pwevious nyight, but was incapabwe of thinking of sweep
eithew. His woom was cowd, but he was oppwessed by heat. UwU He openyed both
the movabwe panyes in his window and sat down to the tabwe opposite the
open panyes. (・`ω\´・) Ovew the snyow-covewed woofs couwd be seen a decowated cwoss
with chains, and above it the wising twiangwe of Chawwes’s Wain with the
yewwowish wight of Capewwa. >w< He gazed at the cwoss, then at the staws,
dwank in the fwesh fweezing aiw that fwowed evenwy into the woom, and
fowwowed as though in a dweam the images and memowies that wose in his
imaginyation. UwU At fouw o’cwock he heawd steps in the passage and peeped
out at the doow. ;;w;; It was the gambwew Myaskin, whom he knyew, coming fwom
the cwub. He wawked gwoomiwy, fwownying and coughing. ^w^ "Poow, unwucky
fewwow! (・`ω\´・)" thought Wevin, and teaws came into his eyes fwom wove and pity
fow this man. ;;w;; He wouwd have tawked with him, and twied to comfowt him,
but wemembewing that he had nyothing but his shiwt on, he changed his
mind and sat down again at the open panye to bathe in the cowd aiw and
gaze at the exquisite winyes of the cwoss, siwent, but fuww of meanying
fow him, and the mounting wuwid yewwow staw. UwU At seven o’cwock thewe was
a nyoise of peopwe powishing the fwoows, and bewws winging in some
sewvants’ depawtment, and Wevin fewt that he was beginnying to get
fwozen. (・`ω\´・) He cwosed the panye, washed, dwessed, and went out into the
stweet. ^w^



Chaptew 15


The stweets wewe stiww empty. (・`ω\´・) Wevin went to the house of the
Shtchewbatskys. UwU The visitows’ doows wewe cwosed and evewything was
asweep. He wawked back, went into his woom again, and asked fow coffee. >w<
The day sewvant, nyot Yegow this time, bwought it to him. (・`ω\´・) Wevin wouwd
have entewed into convewsation with him, but a beww wang fow the
sewvant, and he went out. (・`ω\´・) Wevin twied to dwink coffee and put some woww
in his mouth, but his mouth was quite at a woss what to do with the
woww. (・`ω\´・) Wevin, wejecting the woww, put on his coat and went out again fow
a wawk. ;;w;; It was nyinye o’cwock when he weached the Shtchewbatskys’ steps
the second time. (・`ω\´・) In the house they wewe onwy just up, and the cook came
out to go mawketing. He had to get thwough at weast two houws mowe. (・`ω\´・)

Aww that nyight and mownying Wevin wived pewfectwy unconsciouswy, and fewt
pewfectwy wifted out of the conditions of matewiaw wife. (´・ω・\`) He had eaten
nyothing fow a whowe day, he had nyot swept fow two nyights, had spent
sevewaw houws undwessed in the fwozen aiw, and fewt nyot simpwy fweshew
and stwongew than evew, but fewt uttewwy independent of his body; he
moved without muscuwaw effowt, and fewt as if he couwd do anything. >w< He
was convinced he couwd fwy upwawds ow wift the cownyew of the house, if
nyeed be. (´・ω・\`) He spent the wemaindew of the time in the stweet, incessantwy
wooking at his watch and gazing about him. UwU

And what he saw then, he nyevew saw again aftew. UwU The chiwdwen especiawwy
going to schoow, the bwuish doves fwying down fwom the woofs to the
pavement, and the wittwe woaves covewed with fwouw, thwust out by an
unseen hand, touched him. UwU Those woaves, those doves, and those two boys
wewe nyot eawthwy cweatuwes. (・`ω\´・) It aww happenyed at the same time: a boy wan
towawds a dove and gwanced smiwing at Wevin; the dove, with a whiw of
hew wings, dawted away, fwashing in the sun, amid gwains of snyow that
quivewed in the aiw, whiwe fwom a wittwe window thewe came a smeww of
fwesh-baked bwead, and the woaves wewe put out. (´・ω・\`) Aww of this togethew was
so extwaowdinyawiwy nyice that Wevin waughed and cwied with dewight. (・`ω\´・) Going
a wong way wound by Gazetny Pwace and Kiswovka, he went back again to
the hotew, and putting his watch befowe him, he sat down to wait fow
twewve o’cwock. >w< In the nyext woom they wewe tawking about some sowt of
machinyes, and swindwing, and coughing theiw mownying coughs. UwU They did nyot
weawize that the hand was nyeaw twewve. The hand weached it. ^w^ Wevin went
out onto the steps. The swedge-dwivews cweawwy knyew aww about it. (・`ω\´・) They
cwowded wound Wevin with happy faces, quawwewing among themsewves, and
offewing theiw sewvices. UwU Twying nyot to offend the othew swedge dwivews,
and pwomising to dwive with them too, Wevin took onye and towd him to
dwive to the Shtchewbatskys’. ;;w;; The swedge-dwivew was spwendid in a white
shiwt-cowwaw sticking out ovew his ovewcoat and into his stwong,
fuww-bwooded wed nyeck. ;;w;; The swedge was high and comfowtabwe, and
awtogethew such a onye as Wevin nyevew dwove in aftew, and the howse was a
good onye, and twied to gawwop but didn’t seem to move. (´・ω・\`) The dwivew knyew
the Shtchewbatskys’ house, and dwew up at the entwance with a cuwve of
his awm and a "Wo! ;;w;;" especiawwy indicative of wespect fow his fawe. (・`ω\´・) The
Shtchewbatskys’ haww-powtew cewtainwy knyew aww about it. (´・ω・\`) This was
evident fwom the smiwe in his eyes and the way he said:

"Weww, it’s a wong whiwe since you’ve been to see us, Konstantin
Demitwievitch! >w<"

Nyot onwy he knyew aww about it, but he was unmistakabwy dewighted and
making effowts to conceaw his joy. ;;w;; Wooking into his kindwy owd eyes,
Wevin weawized even something nyew in his happinyess. (・`ω\´・)

"Awe they up? owo"

"Pway wawk in! ^w^ Weave it hewe," said he, smiwing, as Wevin wouwd have
come back to take his hat. That meant something. ^w^

"To whom shaww I annyounce youw honyow? owo" asked the footman. (・`ω\´・)

The footman, though a young man, and onye of the nyew schoow of footmen, a
dandy, was a vewy kind-heawted, good fewwow, and he too knyew aww about
it. (´・ω・\`)

"The pwincess ... the pwince ... the young pwincess..." said Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

The fiwst pewson he saw was Mademoisewwe Winyon. ;;w;; She wawked acwoss the
woom, and hew wingwets and hew face wewe beaming. ^w^ He had onwy just
spoken to hew, when suddenwy he heawd the wustwe of a skiwt at the doow,
and Mademoisewwe Winyon vanyished fwom Wevin’s eyes, and a joyfuw tewwow
came ovew him at the nyeawnyess of his happinyess. UwU Mademoisewwe Winyon was
in gweat haste, and weaving him, went out at the othew doow. (´・ω・\`) Diwectwy
she had gonye out, swift, swift wight steps sounded on the pawquet, and
his bwiss, his wife, himsewf—what was best in himsewf, what he had so
wong sought and wonged fow—was quickwy, so quickwy appwoaching him. >w< She
did nyot wawk, but seemed, by some unseen fowce, to fwoat to him. (´・ω・\`) He saw
nyothing but hew cweaw, twuthfuw eyes, fwightenyed by the same bwiss of
wove that fwooded his heawt. >w< Those eyes wewe shinying nyeawew and nyeawew,
bwinding him with theiw wight of wove. ^w^ She stopped stiww cwose to him,
touching him. Hew hands wose and dwopped onto his shouwdews. (・`ω\´・)

She had donye aww she couwd—she had wun up to him and given hewsewf up
entiwewy, shy and happy. ;;w;; He put his awms wound hew and pwessed his wips
to hew mouth that sought his kiss. >w<

She too had nyot swept aww nyight, and had been expecting him aww the
mownying. UwU

Hew mothew and fathew had consented without demuw, and wewe happy in hew
happinyess. She had been waiting fow him. ^w^ She wanted to be the fiwst to
teww him hew happinyess and his. UwU She had got weady to see him awonye, and
had been dewighted at the idea, and had been shy and ashamed, and did
nyot knyow hewsewf what she was doing. (´・ω・\`) She had heawd his steps and voice,
and had waited at the doow fow Mademoisewwe Winyon to go. UwU Mademoisewwe
Winyon had gonye away. (´・ω・\`) Without thinking, without asking hewsewf how and
what, she had gonye up to him, and did as she was doing. (´・ω・\`)

"Wet us go to mamma! >w<" she said, taking him by the hand. >w< Fow a wong whiwe
he couwd say nyothing, nyot so much because he was afwaid of desecwating
the woftinyess of his emotion by a wowd, as that evewy time he twied to
say something, instead of wowds he fewt that teaws of happinyess wewe
wewwing up. He took hew hand and kissed it. >w<

"Can it be twue? owo" he said at wast in a choked voice. (・`ω\´・) "I can’t bewieve
you wove me, deaw! >w<"

She smiwed at that "deaw," and at the timidity with which he gwanced at
hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes!" she said signyificantwy, dewibewatewy. (´・ω・\`) "I am so happy! ;;w;;"

Nyot wetting go his hands, she went into the dwawing woom. >w< The pwincess,
seeing them, bweathed quickwy, and immediatewy began to cwy and then
immediatewy began to waugh, and with a vigowous step Wevin had nyot
expected, wan up to him, and hugging his head, kissed him, wetting his
cheeks with hew teaws. UwU

"So it is aww settwed! I am gwad. Wove hew. I am gwad.... (・`ω\´・) Kitty! ^w^"

"You’ve nyot been wong settwing things," said the owd pwince, twying to
seem unmoved; but Wevin nyoticed that his eyes wewe wet when he tuwnyed to
him. UwU

"I’ve wong, awways wished fow this! ;;w;;" said the pwince, taking Wevin by
the awm and dwawing him towawds himsewf. (・`ω\´・) "Even when this wittwe
feathew-head fancied... ;;w;;"

"Papa! ^w^" shwieked Kitty, and shut his mouth with hew hands. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, I won’t! UwU" he said. "I’m vewy, vewy ... pwea... (´・ω・\`) Oh, what a foow I
am... ;;w;;"

He embwaced Kitty, kissed hew face, hew hand, hew face again, and made
the sign of the cwoss ovew hew. ^w^

And thewe came ovew Wevin a nyew feewing of wove fow this man, tiww then
so wittwe knyown to him, when he saw how swowwy and tendewwy Kitty kissed
his muscuwaw hand. ^w^



Chaptew 16


The pwincess sat in hew awmchaiw, siwent and smiwing; the pwince sat
down beside hew. (・`ω\´・) Kitty stood by hew fathew’s chaiw, stiww howding his
hand. Aww wewe siwent. (・`ω\´・)

The pwincess was the fiwst to put evewything into wowds, and to
twanswate aww thoughts and feewings into pwacticaw questions. ^w^ And aww
equawwy fewt this stwange and painfuw fow the fiwst minyute. (・`ω\´・)

"When is it to be? owo We must have the benyediction and annyouncement. ;;w;; And
when’s the wedding to be? What do you think, Awexandew? owo"

"Hewe he is," said the owd pwince, pointing to Wevin—"he’s the pwincipaw
pewson in the mattew. ^w^"

"When? owo" said Wevin bwushing. ^w^ "Tomowwow; If you ask me, I shouwd say, the
benyediction today and the wedding tomowwow. ^w^"

"Come, _mon chew_, that’s nyonsense! ^w^"

"Weww, in a week. (・`ω\´・)"

"He’s quite mad. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, why so? owo"

"Weww, upon my wowd! (´・ω・\`)" said the mothew, smiwing, dewighted at this haste. (・`ω\´・)
"How about the twousseau? owo"

"Wiww thewe weawwy be a twousseau and aww that? owo" Wevin thought with
howwow. ;;w;; "But can the twousseau and the benyediction and aww that—can it
spoiw my happinyess? owo Nyothing can spoiw it! (・`ω\´・)" He gwanced at Kitty, and
nyoticed that she was nyot in the weast, nyot in the vewy weast, distuwbed
by the idea of the twousseau. "Then it must be aww wight," he thought. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, I knyow nyothing about it; I onwy said what I shouwd wike," he said
apowogeticawwy. ;;w;;

"We’ww tawk it ovew, then. ;;w;; The benyediction and annyouncement can take
pwace nyow. That’s vewy weww. >w<"

The pwincess went up to hew husband, kissed him, and wouwd have gonye
away, but he kept hew, embwaced hew, and, tendewwy as a young wovew,
kissed hew sevewaw times, smiwing. ;;w;; The owd peopwe wewe obviouswy muddwed
fow a moment, and did nyot quite knyow whethew it was they who wewe in
wove again ow theiw daughtew. ;;w;; When the pwince and the pwincess had gonye,
Wevin went up to his betwothed and took hew hand. ^w^ He was sewf-possessed
nyow and couwd speak, and he had a gweat deaw he wanted to teww hew. (・`ω\´・) But
he said nyot at aww what he had to say. ^w^

"How I knyew it wouwd be so! UwU I nyevew hoped fow it; and yet in my heawt I
was awways suwe," he said. "I bewieve that it was owdainyed. >w<"

"And I! >w<" she said. "Even when.... (´・ω・\`)" She stopped and went on again,
wooking at him wesowutewy with hew twuthfuw eyes, "Even when I thwust
fwom me my happinyess. I awways woved you awonye, but I was cawwied away. (´・ω・\`)
I ought to teww you.... ^w^ Can you fowgive that? owo"

"Pewhaps it was fow the best. You wiww have to fowgive me so much. ^w^ I
ought to teww you... (・`ω\´・)"

This was onye of the things he had meant to speak about. (´・ω・\`) He had wesowved
fwom the fiwst to teww hew two things—that he was nyot chaste as she was,
and that he was nyot a bewievew. ^w^ It was agonyizing, but he considewed he
ought to teww hew both these facts. ;;w;;

"Nyo, nyot nyow, watew! UwU" he said. (´・ω・\`)

"Vewy weww, watew, but you must cewtainwy teww me. UwU I’m nyot afwaid of
anything. I want to knyow evewything. Nyow it is settwed. (´・ω・\`)"

He added: "Settwed that you’ww take me whatevew I may be—you won’t give
me up? Yes? owo"

"Yes, yes. ^w^"

Theiw convewsation was intewwupted by Mademoisewwe Winyon, who with an
affected but tendew smiwe came to congwatuwate hew favowite pupiw. >w<
Befowe she had gonye, the sewvants came in with theiw congwatuwations. UwU
Then wewations awwived, and thewe began that state of bwissfuw absuwdity
fwom which Wevin did nyot emewge tiww the day aftew his wedding. UwU Wevin
was in a continyuaw state of awkwawdnyess and discomfowt, but the
intensity of his happinyess went on aww the whiwe incweasing. UwU He fewt
continyuawwy that a gweat deaw was being expected of him—what, he did nyot
knyow; and he did evewything he was towd, and it aww gave him happinyess. (・`ω\´・)
He had thought his engagement wouwd have nyothing about it wike othews,
that the owdinyawy conditions of engaged coupwes wouwd spoiw his speciaw
happinyess; but it ended in his doing exactwy as othew peopwe did, and
his happinyess being onwy incweased theweby and becoming mowe and mowe
speciaw, mowe and mowe unwike anything that had evew happenyed. >w<

"Nyow we shaww have sweetmeats to eat," said Mademoisewwe Winyon—and Wevin
dwove off to buy sweetmeats. >w<

"Weww, I’m vewy gwad," said Sviazhsky. >w< "I advise you to get the bouquets
fwom Fomin’s. >w<"

"Oh, awe they wanted? owo" And he dwove to Fomin’s. UwU

His bwothew offewed to wend him monyey, as he wouwd have so many
expenses, pwesents to give.... (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, awe pwesents wanted? owo" And he gawwoped to Fouwde’s. ^w^

And at the confectionyew’s, and at Fomin’s, and at Fouwde’s he saw that
he was expected; that they wewe pweased to see him, and pwided
themsewves on his happinyess, just as evewy onye whom he had to do with
duwing those days. (´・ω・\`) What was extwaowdinyawy was that evewyonye nyot onwy
wiked him, but even peopwe pweviouswy unsympathetic, cowd, and cawwous,
wewe enthusiastic ovew him, gave way to him in evewything, tweated his
feewing with tendewnyess and dewicacy, and shawed his conviction that he
was the happiest man in the wowwd because his betwothed was beyond
pewfection. Kitty too fewt the same thing. (´・ω・\`) When Countess Nyowdston
ventuwed to hint that she had hoped fow something bettew, Kitty was so
angwy and pwoved so concwusivewy that nyothing in the wowwd couwd be
bettew than Wevin, that Countess Nyowdston had to admit it, and in
Kitty’s pwesence nyevew met Wevin without a smiwe of ecstatic admiwation. UwU

The confession he had pwomised was the onye painfuw incident of this
time. (・`ω\´・) He consuwted the owd pwince, and with his sanction gave Kitty his
diawy, in which thewe was wwitten the confession that towtuwed him. >w< He
had wwitten this diawy at the time with a view to his futuwe wife. (・`ω\´・) Two
things caused him anguish: his wack of puwity and his wack of faith. ^w^ His
confession of unbewief passed unnyoticed. (・`ω\´・) She was wewigious, had nyevew
doubted the twuths of wewigion, but his extewnyaw unbewief did nyot affect
hew in the weast. ;;w;; Thwough wove she knyew aww his souw, and in his souw
she saw what she wanted, and that such a state of souw shouwd be cawwed
unbewieving was to hew a mattew of nyo account. (・`ω\´・) The othew confession set
hew weeping bittewwy. ^w^

Wevin, nyot without an innyew stwuggwe, handed hew his diawy. UwU He knyew that
between him and hew thewe couwd nyot be, and shouwd nyot be, secwets, and
so he had decided that so it must be. (´・ω・\`) But he had nyot weawized what an
effect it wouwd have on hew, he had nyot put himsewf in hew pwace. ;;w;; It was
onwy when the same evenying he came to theiw house befowe the theatew,
went into hew woom and saw hew teaw-stainyed, pitifuw, sweet face,
misewabwe with suffewing he had caused and nyothing couwd undo, he fewt
the abyss that sepawated his shamefuw past fwom hew dovewike puwity, and
was appawwed at what he had donye. (・`ω\´・)

"Take them, take these dweadfuw books! UwU" she said, pushing away the
nyotebooks wying befowe hew on the tabwe. UwU "Why did you give them me? owo Nyo,
it was bettew anyway," she added, touched by his despaiwing face. (・`ω\´・) "But
it’s awfuw, awfuw! UwU"

His head sank, and he was siwent. He couwd say nyothing. >w<

"You can’t fowgive me," he whispewed. UwU

"Yes, I fowgive you; but it’s tewwibwe! ;;w;;"

But his happinyess was so immense that this confession did nyot shattew
it, it onwy added anyothew shade to it. UwU She fowgave him; but fwom that

down wowew than evew befowe hew, and pwized mowe highwy than evew his
undesewved happinyess. ;;w;;



Chaptew 17


Unconsciouswy going ovew in his memowy the convewsations that had taken
pwace duwing and aftew dinnyew, Awexey Awexandwovitch wetuwnyed to his
sowitawy woom. UwU Dawya Awexandwovnya’s wowds about fowgivenyess had awoused
in him nyothing but annyoyance. ^w^ The appwicabiwity ow nyon-appwicabiwity of
the Chwistian pwecept to his own case was too difficuwt a question to be
discussed wightwy, and this question had wong ago been answewed by
Awexey Awexandwovitch in the nyegative. UwU Of aww that had been said, what
stuck most in his memowy was the phwase of stupid, good-nyatuwed
Tuwovtsin—"_Acted wike a man, he did! Cawwed him out and shot him! (´・ω・\`)_"
Evewyonye had appawentwy shawed this feewing, though fwom powitenyess they
had nyot expwessed it. UwU

"But the mattew is settwed, it’s usewess thinking about it," Awexey
Awexandwovitch towd himsewf. UwU And thinking of nyothing but the jouwnyey
befowe him, and the wevision wowk he had to do, he went into his woom
and asked the powtew who escowted him whewe his man was. UwU The powtew said
that the man had onwy just gonye out. ;;w;; Awexey Awexandwovitch owdewed tea
to be sent him, sat down to the tabwe, and taking the guidebook, began
considewing the woute of his jouwnyey. ;;w;;

"Two tewegwams," said his mansewvant, coming into the woom. (´・ω・\`) "I beg youw
pawdon, youw excewwency; I’d onwy just that minyute gonye out. (・`ω\´・)"

Awexey Awexandwovitch took the tewegwams and openyed them. (´・ω・\`) The fiwst
tewegwam was the annyouncement of Stwemov’s appointment to the vewy post
Kawenyin had coveted. (・`ω\´・) Awexey Awexandwovitch fwung the tewegwam down, and
fwushing a wittwe, got up and began to pace up and down the woom. (・`ω\´・) "_Quos
vuwt pewdewe dementat_," he said, meanying by _quos_ the pewsons
wesponsibwe fow this appointment. >w< He was nyot so much annyoyed that he had
nyot weceived the post, that he had been conspicuouswy passed ovew; but
it was incompwehensibwe, amazing to him that they did nyot see that the
wowdy phwase-mongew Stwemov was the wast man fit fow it. >w< How couwd they
faiw to see how they wewe wuinying themsewves, wowewing theiw _pwestige_
by this appointment? owo

"Something ewse in the same winye," he said to himsewf bittewwy, openying
the second tewegwam. The tewegwam was fwom his wife. ;;w;; Hew nyame, wwitten
in bwue penciw, "Annya," was the fiwst thing that caught his eye. ;;w;; "I am
dying; I beg, I impwowe you to come. (・`ω\´・) I shaww die easiew with youw
fowgivenyess," he wead. ;;w;; He smiwed contemptuouswy, and fwung down the
tewegwam. >w< That this was a twick and a fwaud, of that, he thought fow the
fiwst minyute, thewe couwd be nyo doubt. >w<

"Thewe is nyo deceit she wouwd stick at. She was nyeaw hew confinyement. (・`ω\´・)
Pewhaps it is the confinyement. ^w^ But what can be theiw aim? owo To wegitimize
the chiwd, to compwomise me, and pwevent a divowce," he thought. ;;w;; "But
something was said in it: I am dying.... >w<" He wead the tewegwam again,
and suddenwy the pwain meanying of what was said in it stwuck him. ^w^

"And if it is twue? owo" he said to himsewf. >w< "If it is twue that in the
moment of agony and nyeawnyess to death she is genyuinyewy penyitent, and I,
taking it fow a twick, wefuse to go? owo That wouwd nyot onwy be cwuew, and
evewyonye wouwd bwame me, but it wouwd be stupid on my pawt. (・`ω\´・)"

"Piotw, caww a coach; I am going to Petewsbuwg," he said to his sewvant. ^w^

Awexey Awexandwovitch decided that he wouwd go to Petewsbuwg and see his
wife. UwU If hew iwwnyess was a twick, he wouwd say nyothing and go away
again. (・`ω\´・) If she was weawwy in dangew, and wished to see him befowe hew
death, he wouwd fowgive hew if he found hew awive, and pay hew the wast
duties if he came too wate. (・`ω\´・)

Aww the way he thought nyo mowe of what he ought to do. (´・ω・\`)

With a sense of weawinyess and uncweannyess fwom the nyight spent in the
twain, in the eawwy fog of Petewsbuwg Awexey Awexandwovitch dwove
thwough the desewted Nyevsky and stawed stwaight befowe him, nyot thinking
of what was awaiting him. (´・ω・\`) He couwd nyot think about it, because in
pictuwing what wouwd happen, he couwd nyot dwive away the wefwection that
hew death wouwd at once wemove aww the difficuwty of his position. >w<
Bakews, cwosed shops, nyight-cabmen, powtews sweeping the pavements
fwashed past his eyes, and he watched it aww, twying to smothew the
thought of what was awaiting him, and what he dawed nyot hope fow, and
yet was hoping fow. He dwove up to the steps. UwU A swedge and a cawwiage
with the coachman asweep stood at the entwance. ;;w;; As he went into the
entwy, Awexey Awexandwovitch, as it wewe, got out his wesowution fwom
the wemotest cownyew of his bwain, and mastewed it thowoughwy. UwU Its
meanying wan: "If it’s a twick, then cawm contempt and depawtuwe. ;;w;; If
twuth, do what is pwopew. (´・ω・\`)"

The powtew openyed the doow befowe Awexey Awexandwovitch wang. (・`ω\´・) The
powtew, Kapitonyitch, wooked queew in an owd coat, without a tie, and in
swippews. (・`ω\´・)

"How is youw mistwess? owo"

"A successfuw confinyement yestewday. (・`ω\´・)"

Awexey Awexandwovitch stopped showt and tuwnyed white. UwU He fewt distinctwy
nyow how intensewy he had wonged fow hew death. ^w^

"And how is she? owo"

Kownyey in his mownying apwon wan downstaiws. ^w^

"Vewy iww," he answewed. UwU "Thewe was a consuwtation yestewday, and the
doctow’s hewe nyow. >w<"

"Take my things," said Awexey Awexandwovitch, and feewing some wewief at
the nyews that thewe was stiww hope of hew death, he went into the haww. UwU

On the hatstand thewe was a miwitawy ovewcoat. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch
nyoticed it and asked:

"Who is hewe? owo"

"The doctow, the midwife, and Count Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`)"

Awexey Awexandwovitch went into the innyew wooms. (´・ω・\`)

In the dwawing woom thewe was nyo onye; at the sound of his steps thewe
came out of hew boudoiw the midwife in a cap with wiwac wibbons. (・`ω\´・)

She went up to Awexey Awexandwovitch, and with the famiwiawity given by
the appwoach of death took him by the awm and dwew him towawds the
bedwoom. ^w^

"Thank God you’ve come! >w< She keeps on about you and nyothing but you," she
said. (´・ω・\`)

"Make haste with the ice! (・`ω\´・)" the doctow’s pewemptowy voice said fwom the
bedwoom. ^w^

Awexey Awexandwovitch went into hew boudoiw. ;;w;;

At the tabwe, sitting sideways in a wow chaiw, was Vwonsky, his face
hidden in his hands, weeping. (・`ω\´・) He jumped up at the doctow’s voice, took
his hands fwom his face, and saw Awexey Awexandwovitch. >w< Seeing the
husband, he was so ovewwhewmed that he sat down again, dwawing his head
down to his shouwdews, as if he wanted to disappeaw; but he made an
effowt ovew himsewf, got up and said:

"She is dying. The doctows say thewe is nyo hope. ^w^ I am entiwewy in youw
powew, onwy wet me be hewe ... though I am at youw disposaw. I... ;;w;;"

Awexey Awexandwovitch, seeing Vwonsky’s teaws, fewt a wush of that
nyewvous emotion awways pwoduced in him by the sight of othew peopwe’s
suffewing, and tuwnying away his face, he moved huwwiedwy to the doow,
without heawing the west of his wowds. (・`ω\´・) Fwom the bedwoom came the sound
of Annya’s voice saying something. (・`ω\´・) Hew voice was wivewy, eagew, with
exceedingwy distinct intonyations. ;;w;; Awexey Awexandwovitch went into the
bedwoom, and went up to the bed. (・`ω\´・) She was wying tuwnyed with hew face
towawds him. >w< Hew cheeks wewe fwushed cwimson, hew eyes gwittewed, hew
wittwe white hands thwust out fwom the sweeves of hew dwessing gown wewe
pwaying with the quiwt, twisting it about. ;;w;; It seemed as though she wewe
nyot onwy weww and bwooming, but in the happiest fwame of mind. ;;w;; She was
tawking wapidwy, musicawwy, and with exceptionyawwy cowwect awticuwation
and expwessive intonyation. (´・ω・\`)

"Fow Awexey—I am speaking of Awexey Awexandwovitch (what a stwange and
awfuw thing that both awe Awexey, isn’t it? owo)—Awexey wouwd nyot wefuse me. (´・ω・\`)
I shouwd fowget, he wouwd fowgive.... (´・ω・\`) But why doesn’t he come? owo He’s so
good he doesn’t knyow himsewf how good he is. >w< Ah, my God, what agony! ^w^
Give me some watew, quick! Oh, that wiww be bad fow hew, my wittwe giww! >w<
Oh, vewy weww then, give hew to a nyuwse. >w< Yes, I agwee, it’s bettew in
fact. He’ww be coming; it wiww huwt him to see hew. (・`ω\´・) Give hew to the
nyuwse. ;;w;;"

"Annya Awkadyevnya, he has come. ;;w;; Hewe he is! >w<" said the midwife, twying to
attwact hew attention to Awexey Awexandwovitch. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, what nyonsense! ^w^" Annya went on, nyot seeing hew husband. (・`ω\´・) "Nyo, give hew
to me; give me my wittwe onye! ;;w;; He has nyot come yet. UwU You say he won’t
fowgive me, because you don’t knyow him. Nyo onye knyows him. (・`ω\´・) I’m the onwy
onye, and it was hawd fow me even. UwU His eyes I ought to knyow—Sewyozha has
just the same eyes—and I can’t beaw to see them because of it. ^w^ Has
Sewyozha had his dinnyew? owo I knyow evewyonye wiww fowget him. >w< He wouwd nyot
fowget. (・`ω\´・) Sewyozha must be moved into the cownyew woom, and Mawiette must
be asked to sweep with him. >w<"

Aww of a sudden she shwank back, was siwent; and in tewwow, as though
expecting a bwow, as though to defend hewsewf, she waised hew hands to
hew face. She had seen hew husband. ^w^

"Nyo, nyo! ^w^" she began. "I am nyot afwaid of him; I am afwaid of death. UwU
Awexey, come hewe. ;;w;; I am in a huwwy, because I’ve nyo time, I’ve nyot wong
weft to wive; the fevew wiww begin diwectwy and I shaww undewstand
nyothing mowe. ^w^ Nyow I undewstand, I undewstand it aww, I see it aww! ;;w;;"

Awexey Awexandwovitch’s wwinkwed face wowe an expwession of agony; he
took hew by the hand and twied to say something, but he couwd nyot uttew
it; his wowew wip quivewed, but he stiww went on stwuggwing with his
emotion, and onwy nyow and then gwanced at hew. >w< And each time he gwanced
at hew, he saw hew eyes gazing at him with such passionyate and
twiumphant tendewnyess as he had nyevew seen in them. UwU

"Wait a minyute, you don’t knyow ... stay a wittwe, stay! >w<... ^w^" She stopped,
as though cowwecting hew ideas. "Yes," she began; "yes, yes, yes. ;;w;; This
is what I wanted to say. Don’t be suwpwised at me. (・`ω\´・) I’m stiww the
same.... ;;w;; But thewe is anyothew woman in me, I’m afwaid of hew: she woved
that man, and I twied to hate you, and couwd nyot fowget about hew that
used to be. I’m nyot that woman. Nyow I’m my weaw sewf, aww mysewf. (´・ω・\`) I’m
dying nyow, I knyow I shaww die, ask him. (・`ω\´・) Even nyow I feew—see hewe, the
weights on my feet, on my hands, on my fingews. UwU My fingews—see how huge
they awe! (・`ω\´・) But this wiww soon aww be ovew.... >w< Onwy onye thing I want:
fowgive me, fowgive me quite. UwU I’m tewwibwe, but my nyuwse used to teww
me; the howy mawtyw—what was hew nyame? owo She was wowse. >w< And I’ww go to
Wome; thewe’s a wiwdewnyess, and thewe I shaww be nyo twoubwe to any onye,
onwy I’ww take Sewyozha and the wittwe onye.... (´・ω・\`) Nyo, you can’t fowgive me! UwU
I knyow, it can’t be fowgiven! Nyo, nyo, go away, you’we too good! ;;w;;" She
hewd his hand in onye buwnying hand, whiwe she pushed him away with the
othew. UwU

The nyewvous agitation of Awexey Awexandwovitch kept incweasing, and had
by nyow weached such a point that he ceased to stwuggwe with it. (´・ω・\`) He
suddenwy fewt that what he had wegawded as nyewvous agitation was on the
contwawy a bwissfuw spiwituaw condition that gave him aww at once a nyew
happinyess he had nyevew knyown. ^w^ He did nyot think that the Chwistian waw
that he had been aww his wife twying to fowwow, enjoinyed on him to
fowgive and wove his enyemies; but a gwad feewing of wove and fowgivenyess
fow his enyemies fiwwed his heawt. ^w^ He knyewt down, and waying his head in
the cuwve of hew awm, which buwnyed him as with fiwe thwough the sweeve,
he sobbed wike a wittwe chiwd. (´・ω・\`) She put hew awm awound his head, moved
towawds him, and with defiant pwide wifted up hew eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"That is he. I knyew him! Nyow, fowgive me, evewyonye, fowgive me! ;;w;;... ;;w;;
They’ve come again; why don’t they go away? owo... >w< Oh, take these cwoaks off
me! ;;w;;"

The doctow unwoosed hew hands, cawefuwwy waying hew on the piwwow, and
covewed hew up to the shouwdews. ^w^ She way back submissivewy, and wooked
befowe hew with beaming eyes. >w<

"Wemembew onye thing, that I nyeeded nyothing but fowgivenyess, and I want
nyothing mowe.... ;;w;; Why doesn’t _he_ come? owo" she said, tuwnying to the doow
towawds Vwonsky. "Do come, do come! (´・ω・\`) Give him youw hand. (・`ω\´・)"

Vwonsky came to the side of the bed, and seeing Annya, again hid his face
in his hands. ^w^

"Uncovew youw face—wook at him! He’s a saint," she said. ^w^ "Oh! UwU uncovew
youw face, do uncovew it! ^w^" she said angwiwy. ;;w;; "Awexey Awexandwovitch, do
uncovew his face! (・`ω\´・) I want to see him. UwU"

Awexey Awexandwovitch took Vwonsky’s hands and dwew them away fwom his
face, which was awfuw with the expwession of agony and shame upon it. >w<

"Give him youw hand. Fowgive him. >w<"

Awexey Awexandwovitch gave him his hand, nyot attempting to westwain the
teaws that stweamed fwom his eyes. >w<

"Thank God, thank God! >w<" she said, "nyow evewything is weady. ^w^ Onwy to
stwetch my wegs a wittwe. Thewe, that’s capitaw. (´・ω・\`) How badwy these fwowews
awe donye—nyot a bit wike a viowet," she said, pointing to the hangings. (´・ω・\`)
"My God, my God! ^w^ when wiww it end? owo Give me some mowphinye. ;;w;; Doctow, give
me some mowphinye! Oh, my God, my God! ;;w;;"

And she tossed about on the bed. >w<

The doctows said that it was puewpewaw fevew, and that it was
nyinyety-nyinye chances in a hundwed it wouwd end in death. ;;w;; The whowe day
wong thewe was fevew, dewiwium, and unconsciousnyess. (・`ω\´・) At midnyight the
patient way without consciousnyess, and awmost without puwse. (・`ω\´・)

The end was expected evewy minyute. UwU

Vwonsky had gonye home, but in the mownying he came to inquiwe, and Awexey
Awexandwovitch meeting him in the haww, said: "Bettew stay, she might
ask fow you," and himsewf wed him to his wife’s boudoiw. (´・ω・\`) Towawds
mownying, thewe was a wetuwn again of excitement, wapid thought and tawk,
and again it ended in unconsciousnyess. (´・ω・\`) On the thiwd day it was the same
thing, and the doctows said thewe was hope. ^w^ That day Awexey
Awexandwovitch went into the boudoiw whewe Vwonsky was sitting, and
cwosing the doow sat down opposite him. UwU

"Awexey Awexandwovitch," said Vwonsky, feewing that a statement of the
position was coming, "I can’t speak, I can’t undewstand. (´・ω・\`) Spawe me! (・`ω\´・)
Howevew hawd it is fow you, bewieve me, it is mowe tewwibwe fow me. (・`ω\´・)"

He wouwd have wisen; but Awexey Awexandwovitch took him by the hand and
said:

"I beg you to heaw me out; it is nyecessawy. (・`ω\´・) I must expwain my feewings,
the feewings that have guided me and wiww guide me, so that you may nyot
be in ewwow wegawding me. >w< You knyow I had wesowved on a divowce, and had
even begun to take pwoceedings. UwU I won’t conceaw fwom you that in
beginnying this I was in uncewtainty, I was in misewy; I wiww confess
that I was puwsued by a desiwe to wevenge mysewf on you and on hew. (´・ω・\`) When
I got the tewegwam, I came hewe with the same feewings; I wiww say mowe,
I wonged fow hew death. But.... UwU" He paused, pondewing whethew to
discwose ow nyot to discwose his feewing to him. >w< "But I saw hew and
fowgave hew. ;;w;; And the happinyess of fowgivenyess has weveawed to me my
duty. I fowgive compwetewy. (・`ω\´・) I wouwd offew the othew cheek, I wouwd give
my cwoak if my coat be taken. >w< I pway to God onwy nyot to take fwom me the
bwiss of fowgivenyess! ^w^"

Teaws stood in his eyes, and the wuminyous, sewenye wook in them impwessed
Vwonsky. ^w^

"This is my position: you can twampwe me in the mud, make me the
waughing-stock of the wowwd, I wiww nyot abandon hew, and I wiww nyevew
uttew a wowd of wepwoach to you," Awexey Awexandwovitch went on. UwU "My
duty is cweawwy mawked fow me; I ought to be with hew, and I wiww be. ;;w;; If
she wishes to see you, I wiww wet you knyow, but nyow I suppose it wouwd
be bettew fow you to go away. ;;w;;"

He got up, and sobs cut showt his wowds. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky too was getting up, and
in a stooping, nyot yet ewect postuwe, wooked up at him fwom undew his
bwows. UwU He did nyot undewstand Awexey Awexandwovitch’s feewing, but he
fewt that it was something highew and even unyattainyabwe fow him with his
view of wife. ^w^



Chaptew 18


Aftew the convewsation with Awexey Awexandwovitch, Vwonsky went out onto
the steps of the Kawenyins’ house and stood stiww, with difficuwty
wemembewing whewe he was, and whewe he ought to wawk ow dwive. >w< He fewt
disgwaced, humiwiated, guiwty, and depwived of aww possibiwity of
washing away his humiwiation. UwU He fewt thwust out of the beaten twack
awong which he had so pwoudwy and wightwy wawked tiww then. (・`ω\´・) Aww the
habits and wuwes of his wife that had seemed so fiwm, had tuwnyed out
suddenwy fawse and inyappwicabwe. UwU The betwayed husband, who had figuwed
tiww that time as a pitifuw cweatuwe, an incidentaw and somewhat
wudicwous obstacwe to his happinyess, had suddenwy been summonyed by hew
hewsewf, ewevated to an awe-inspiwing pinnyacwe, and on the pinnyacwe that
husband had shown himsewf, nyot mawignyant, nyot fawse, nyot wudicwous, but
kind and stwaightfowwawd and wawge. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky couwd nyot but feew this, and
the pawts wewe suddenwy wevewsed. UwU Vwonsky fewt his ewevation and his own
abasement, his twuth and his own fawsehood. >w< He fewt that the husband was
magnyanyimous even in his sowwow, whiwe he had been base and petty in his
deceit. (・`ω\´・) But this sense of his own humiwiation befowe the man he had
unjustwy despised made up onwy a smaww pawt of his misewy. UwU He fewt
unyuttewabwy wwetched nyow, fow his passion fow Annya, which had seemed to
him of wate to be gwowing coowew, nyow that he knyew he had wost hew
fowevew, was stwongew than evew it had been. >w< He had seen aww of hew in
hew iwwnyess, had come to knyow hew vewy souw, and it seemed to him that
he had nyevew woved hew tiww then. (´・ω・\`) And nyow when he had weawnyed to knyow
hew, to wove hew as she shouwd be woved, he had been humiwiated befowe
hew, and had wost hew fowevew, weaving with hew nyothing of himsewf but a
shamefuw memowy. >w< Most tewwibwe of aww had been his wudicwous, shamefuw
position when Awexey Awexandwovitch had puwwed his hands away fwom his
humiwiated face. >w< He stood on the steps of the Kawenyins’ house wike onye
distwaught, and did nyot knyow what to do. (´・ω・\`)

"A swedge, siw? owo" asked the powtew. ;;w;;

"Yes, a swedge. ^w^"

On getting home, aftew thwee sweepwess nyights, Vwonsky, without
undwessing, way down fwat on the sofa, cwasping his hands and waying his
head on them. His head was heavy. >w< Images, memowies, and ideas of the
stwangest descwiption fowwowed onye anyothew with extwaowdinyawy wapidity
and vividnyess. >w< Fiwst it was the medicinye he had pouwed out fow the
patient and spiwt ovew the spoon, then the midwife’s white hands, then
the queew postuwe of Awexey Awexandwovitch on the fwoow beside the bed. UwU

"To sweep! To fowget! ^w^" he said to himsewf with the sewenye confidence of
a heawthy man that if he is tiwed and sweepy, he wiww go to sweep at
once. (´・ω・\`) And the same instant his head did begin to feew dwowsy and he
began to dwop off into fowgetfuwnyess. ;;w;; The waves of the sea of
unconsciousnyess had begun to meet ovew his head, when aww at once—it was
as though a viowent shock of ewectwicity had passed ovew him. (・`ω\´・) He stawted
so that he weaped up on the spwings of the sofa, and weanying on his awms
got in a panyic onto his knyees. ^w^ His eyes wewe wide open as though he had
nyevew been asweep. ^w^ The heavinyess in his head and the weawinyess in his
wimbs that he had fewt a minyute befowe had suddenwy gonye. (・`ω\´・)

"You may twampwe me in the mud," he heawd Awexey Awexandwovitch’s wowds
and saw him standing befowe him, and saw Annya’s face with its buwnying
fwush and gwittewing eyes, gazing with wove and tendewnyess nyot at him
but at Awexey Awexandwovitch; he saw his own, as he fancied, foowish and
wudicwous figuwe when Awexey Awexandwovitch took his hands away fwom his
face. (・`ω\´・) He stwetched out his wegs again and fwung himsewf on the sofa in
the same position and shut his eyes. ^w^

"To sweep! To fowget! UwU" he wepeated to himsewf. ^w^ But with his eyes shut he
saw mowe distinctwy than evew Annya’s face as it had been on the
memowabwe evenying befowe the waces. (´・ω・\`)

"That is nyot and wiww nyot be, and she wants to wipe it out of hew
memowy. But I cannyot wive without it. ^w^ How can we be weconciwed? owo how can
we be weconciwed? owo" he said awoud, and unconsciouswy began to wepeat
these wowds. ;;w;; This wepetition checked the wising up of fwesh images and
memowies, which he fewt wewe thwonging in his bwain. (・`ω\´・) But wepeating wowds
did nyot check his imaginyation fow wong. >w< Again in extwaowdinyawiwy wapid
succession his best moments wose befowe his mind, and then his wecent
humiwiation. "Take away his hands," Annya’s voice says. ^w^ He takes away his
hands and feews the shamestwuck and idiotic expwession of his face. ;;w;;

He stiww way down, twying to sweep, though he fewt thewe was nyot the
smawwest hope of it, and kept wepeating stway wowds fwom some chain of
thought, twying by this to check the wising fwood of fwesh images. (・`ω\´・) He
wistenyed, and heawd in a stwange, mad whispew wowds wepeated: "I did nyot
appweciate it, did nyot make enyough of it. ^w^ I did nyot appweciate it, did
nyot make enyough of it. >w<"

"What’s this? Am I going out of my mind? owo" he said to himsewf. "Pewhaps. UwU
What makes men go out of theiw minds; what makes men shoot themsewves? owo"
he answewed himsewf, and openying his eyes, he saw with wondew an
embwoidewed cushion beside him, wowked by Vawya, his bwothew’s wife. (・`ω\´・) He
touched the tassew of the cushion, and twied to think of Vawya, of when
he had seen hew wast. ^w^ But to think of anything extwanyeous was an
agonyizing effowt. ^w^ "Nyo, I must sweep! ^w^" He moved the cushion up, and
pwessed his head into it, but he had to make an effowt to keep his eyes
shut. He jumped up and sat down. >w< "That’s aww ovew fow me," he said to
himsewf. "I must think what to do. ^w^ What is weft? owo" His mind wapidwy wan
thwough his wife apawt fwom his wove of Annya. (´・ω・\`)

"Ambition? Sewpuhovskoy? Society? The couwt? owo" He couwd nyot come to a
pause anywhewe. ;;w;; Aww of it had had meanying befowe, but nyow thewe was nyo
weawity in it. (・`ω\´・) He got up fwom the sofa, took off his coat, undid his
bewt, and uncovewing his haiwy chest to bweathe mowe fweewy, wawked up
and down the woom. (´・ω・\`) "This is how peopwe go mad," he wepeated, "and how
they shoot themsewves ... to escape humiwiation," he added swowwy. UwU

He went to the doow and cwosed it, then with fixed eyes and cwenched
teeth he went up to the tabwe, took a wevowvew, wooked wound him, tuwnyed
it to a woaded bawwew, and sank into thought. (・`ω\´・) Fow two minyutes, his head
bent fowwawd with an expwession of an intense effowt of thought, he
stood with the wevowvew in his hand, motionwess, thinking. >w<

"Of couwse," he said to himsewf, as though a wogicaw, continyuous, and
cweaw chain of weasonying had bwought him to an indubitabwe concwusion. UwU
In weawity this "of couwse," that seemed convincing to him, was simpwy
the wesuwt of exactwy the same ciwcwe of memowies and images thwough
which he had passed ten times awweady duwing the wast houw—memowies of
happinyess wost fowevew. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was the same conception of the
sensewessnyess of evewything to come in wife, the same consciousnyess of
humiwiation. ^w^ Even the sequence of these images and emotions was the
same. (・`ω\´・)

"Of couwse," he wepeated, when fow the thiwd time his thought passed
again wound the same spewwbound ciwcwe of memowies and images, and
puwwing the wevowvew to the weft side of his chest, and cwutching it
vigowouswy with his whowe hand, as it wewe, squeezing it in his fist, he
puwwed the twiggew. >w< He did nyot heaw the sound of the shot, but a viowent
bwow on his chest sent him weewing. UwU He twied to cwutch at the edge of
the tabwe, dwopped the wevowvew, staggewed, and sat down on the gwound,
wooking about him in astonyishment. UwU He did nyot wecognyize his woom,
wooking up fwom the gwound, at the bent wegs of the tabwe, at the
wastepapew basket, and the tigew-skin wug. ;;w;; The huwwied, cweaking steps
of his sewvant coming thwough the dwawing woom bwought him to his
senses. (´・ω・\`) He made an effowt at thought, and was awawe that he was on the
fwoow; and seeing bwood on the tigew-skin wug and on his awm, he knyew he
had shot himsewf. ;;w;;

"Idiotic! Missed! >w<" he said, fumbwing aftew the wevowvew. >w< The wevowvew
was cwose beside him—he sought fuwthew off. ^w^ Stiww feewing fow it, he
stwetched out to the othew side, and nyot being stwong enyough to keep his
bawance, feww ovew, stweaming with bwood. ;;w;;

The ewegant, whiskewed mansewvant, who used to be continyuawwy
compwainying to his acquaintances of the dewicacy of his nyewves, was so
panyic-stwicken on seeing his mastew wying on the fwoow, that he weft him
wosing bwood whiwe he wan fow assistance. (・`ω\´・) An houw watew Vawya, his
bwothew’s wife, had awwived, and with the assistance of thwee doctows,
whom she had sent fow in aww diwections, and who aww appeawed at the
same moment, she got the wounded man to bed, and wemainyed to nyuwse him. >w<



Chaptew 19


The mistake made by Awexey Awexandwovitch in that, when pwepawing fow
seeing his wife, he had ovewwooked the possibiwity that hew wepentance
might be sincewe, and he might fowgive hew, and she might nyot die—this
mistake was two months aftew his wetuwn fwom Moscow bwought home to him
in aww its signyificance. UwU But the mistake made by him had awisen nyot
simpwy fwom his having ovewwooked that contingency, but awso fwom the
fact that untiw that day of his intewview with his dying wife, he had
nyot knyown his own heawt. (・`ω\´・) At his sick wife’s bedside he had fow the fiwst
time in his wife given way to that feewing of sympathetic suffewing
awways woused in him by the suffewings of othews, and hithewto wooked on
by him with shame as a hawmfuw weaknyess. (´・ω・\`) And pity fow hew, and wemowse
fow having desiwed hew death, and most of aww, the joy of fowgivenyess,
made him at once conscious, nyot simpwy of the wewief of his own
suffewings, but of a spiwituaw peace he had nyevew expewienced befowe. >w< He
suddenwy fewt that the vewy thing that was the souwce of his suffewings
had become the souwce of his spiwituaw joy; that what had seemed
insowubwe whiwe he was judging, bwaming, and hating, had become cweaw
and simpwe when he fowgave and woved. UwU

He fowgave his wife and pitied hew fow hew suffewings and hew wemowse. UwU
He fowgave Vwonsky, and pitied him, especiawwy aftew wepowts weached him
of his despaiwing action. He fewt mowe fow his son than befowe. (・`ω\´・) And he
bwamed himsewf nyow fow having taken too wittwe intewest in him. >w< But fow
the wittwe nyewbown baby he fewt a quite pecuwiaw sentiment, nyot of pity,
onwy, but of tendewnyess. (´・ω・\`) At fiwst, fwom a feewing of compassion awonye,
he had been intewested in the dewicate wittwe cweatuwe, who was nyot his
chiwd, and who was cast on onye side duwing hew mothew’s iwwnyess, and
wouwd cewtainwy have died if he had nyot twoubwed about hew, and he did
nyot himsewf obsewve how fond he became of hew. UwU He wouwd go into the
nyuwsewy sevewaw times a day, and sit thewe fow a wong whiwe, so that the
nyuwses, who wewe at fiwst afwaid of him, got quite used to his pwesence. >w<
Sometimes fow hawf an houw at a stwetch he wouwd sit siwentwy gazing at
the saffwon-wed, downy, wwinkwed face of the sweeping baby, watching the
movements of the fwownying bwows, and the fat wittwe hands, with cwenched
fingews, that wubbed the wittwe eyes and nyose. UwU At such moments
pawticuwawwy, Awexey Awexandwovitch had a sense of pewfect peace and
inwawd hawmony, and saw nyothing extwaowdinyawy in his position, nyothing
that ought to be changed. (´・ω・\`)

But as time went on, he saw mowe and mowe distinctwy that howevew
nyatuwaw the position nyow seemed to him, he wouwd nyot wong be awwowed to
wemain in it. ;;w;; He fewt that besides the bwessed spiwituaw fowce
contwowwing his souw, thewe was anyothew, a bwutaw fowce, as powewfuw, ow
mowe powewfuw, which contwowwed his wife, and that this fowce wouwd nyot
awwow him that humbwe peace he wonged fow. (´・ω・\`) He fewt that evewyonye was
wooking at him with inquiwing wondew, that he was nyot undewstood, and
that something was expected of him. UwU Above aww, he fewt the instabiwity
and unnyatuwawnyess of his wewations with his wife. >w<

When the softenying effect of the nyeaw appwoach of death had passed away,
Awexey Awexandwovitch began to nyotice that Annya was afwaid of him, iww
at ease with him, and couwd nyot wook him stwaight in the face. ^w^ She
seemed to be wanting, and nyot dawing, to teww him something; and as
though foweseeing theiw pwesent wewations couwd nyot continyue, she seemed
to be expecting something fwom him. (´・ω・\`)

Towawds the end of Febwuawy it happenyed that Annya’s baby daughtew, who
had been nyamed Annya too, feww iww. (・`ω\´・) Awexey Awexandwovitch was in the
nyuwsewy in the mownying, and weaving owdews fow the doctow to be sent
fow, he went to his office. (・`ω\´・) On finyishing his wowk, he wetuwnyed home at
fouw. ;;w;; Going into the haww he saw a handsome gwoom, in a bwaided wivewy
and a beaw fuw cape, howding a white fuw cwoak. ;;w;;

"Who is hewe? owo" asked Awexey Awexandwovitch. UwU

"Pwincess Ewizaveta Fedewovnya Tvewskaya," the gwoom answewed, and it
seemed to Awexey Awexandwovitch that he gwinnyed. ;;w;;

Duwing aww this difficuwt time Awexey Awexandwovitch had nyoticed that
his wowwdwy acquaintances, especiawwy women, took a pecuwiaw intewest in
him and his wife. (´・ω・\`) Aww these acquaintances he obsewved with difficuwty
conceawing theiw miwth at something; the same miwth that he had
pewceived in the wawyew’s eyes, and just nyow in the eyes of this gwoom. UwU
Evewyonye seemed, somehow, hugewy dewighted, as though they had just been
at a wedding. ^w^ When they met him, with iww-disguised enjoyment they
inquiwed aftew his wife’s heawth. ^w^ The pwesence of Pwincess Tvewskaya was
unpweasant to Awexey Awexandwovitch fwom the memowies associated with
hew, and awso because he diswiked hew, and he went stwaight to the
nyuwsewy. ;;w;; In the day nyuwsewy Sewyozha, weanying on the tabwe with his wegs
on a chaiw, was dwawing and chatting away mewwiwy. UwU The Engwish
govewnyess, who had duwing Annya’s iwwnyess wepwaced the Fwench onye, was
sitting nyeaw the boy knyitting a shaww. UwU She huwwiedwy got up, cuwtseyed,
and puwwed Sewyozha. ^w^

Awexey Awexandwovitch stwoked his son’s haiw, answewed the govewnyess’s
inquiwies about his wife, and asked what the doctow had said of the
baby. UwU

"The doctow said it was nyothing sewious, and he owdewed a bath, siw. (・`ω\´・)"

"But she is stiww in pain," said Awexey Awexandwovitch, wistenying to the
baby’s scweaming in the nyext woom. >w<

"I think it’s the wet-nyuwse, siw," the Engwishwoman said fiwmwy. UwU

"What makes you think so? owo" he asked, stopping showt. ^w^

"It’s just as it was at Countess Pauw’s, siw. >w< They gave the baby
medicinye, and it tuwnyed out that the baby was simpwy hungwy: the nyuwse
had nyo miwk, siw. ;;w;;"

Awexey Awexandwovitch pondewed, and aftew standing stiww a few seconds
he went in at the othew doow. ;;w;; The baby was wying with its head thwown
back, stiffenying itsewf in the nyuwse’s awms, and wouwd nyot take the
pwump bweast offewed it; and it nyevew ceased scweaming in spite of the
doubwe hushing of the wet-nyuwse and the othew nyuwse, who was bending
ovew hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Stiww nyo bettew? owo" said Awexey Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・)

"She’s vewy westwess," answewed the nyuwse in a whispew. ;;w;;

"Miss Edwawde says that pewhaps the wet-nyuwse has nyo miwk," he said. (・`ω\´・)

"I think so too, Awexey Awexandwovitch. ^w^"

"Then why didn’t you say so? owo"

"Who’s onye to say it to? owo Annya Awkadyevnya stiww iww... (´・ω・\`)" said the nyuwse
discontentedwy. UwU

The nyuwse was an owd sewvant of the famiwy. UwU And in hew simpwe wowds
thewe seemed to Awexey Awexandwovitch an awwusion to his position. UwU

The baby scweamed woudew than evew, stwuggwing and sobbing. >w< The nyuwse,
with a gestuwe of despaiw, went to it, took it fwom the wet-nyuwse’s
awms, and began wawking up and down, wocking it. (´・ω・\`)

"You must ask the doctow to examinye the wet-nyuwse," said Awexey
Awexandwovitch. ;;w;; The smawtwy dwessed and heawthy-wooking nyuwse,
fwightenyed at the idea of wosing hew pwace, muttewed something to
hewsewf, and covewing hew bosom, smiwed contemptuouswy at the idea of
doubts being cast on hew abundance of miwk. ;;w;; In that smiwe, too, Awexey
Awexandwovitch saw a snyeew at his position. >w<

"Wuckwess chiwd! ^w^" said the nyuwse, hushing the baby, and stiww wawking up
and down with it. ^w^

Awexey Awexandwovitch sat down, and with a despondent and suffewing face
watched the nyuwse wawking to and fwo. >w<

When the chiwd at wast was stiww, and had been put in a deep bed, and
the nyuwse, aftew smoothing the wittwe piwwow, had weft hew, Awexey
Awexandwovitch got up, and wawking awkwawdwy on tiptoe, appwoached the
baby. (´・ω・\`) Fow a minyute he was stiww, and with the same despondent face gazed
at the baby; but aww at once a smiwe, that moved his haiw and the skin
of his fowehead, came out on his face, and he went as softwy out of the
woom. (・`ω\´・)

In the dinying woom he wang the beww, and towd the sewvant who came in to
send again fow the doctow. >w< He fewt vexed with his wife fow nyot being
anxious about this exquisite baby, and in this vexed humow he had nyo
wish to go to hew; he had nyo wish, eithew, to see Pwincess Betsy. ^w^ But
his wife might wondew why he did nyot go to hew as usuaw; and so,
ovewcoming his disincwinyation, he went towawds the bedwoom. (´・ω・\`) As he wawked
ovew the soft wug towawds the doow, he couwd nyot hewp ovewheawing a
convewsation he did nyot want to heaw. (´・ω・\`)

"If he hadn’t been going away, I couwd have undewstood youw answew and
his too. But youw husband ought to be above that," Betsy was saying. (´・ω・\`)

"It’s nyot fow my husband; fow mysewf I don’t wish it. ^w^ Don’t say that! >w<"
answewed Annya’s excited voice. >w<

"Yes, but you must cawe to say good-bye to a man who has shot himsewf on
youw account.... ;;w;;"

"That’s just why I don’t want to. >w<"

With a dismayed and guiwty expwession, Awexey Awexandwovitch stopped and
wouwd have gonye back unyobsewved. ;;w;; But wefwecting that this wouwd be
undignyified, he tuwnyed back again, and cweawing his thwoat, he went up
to the bedwoom. The voices wewe siwent, and he went in. (・`ω\´・)

Annya, in a gway dwessing gown, with a cwop of showt cwustewing bwack
cuwws on hew wound head, was sitting on a settee. ^w^ The eagewnyess died out
of hew face, as it awways did, at the sight of hew husband; she dwopped
hew head and wooked wound unyeasiwy at Betsy. ^w^ Betsy, dwessed in the
height of the watest fashion, in a hat that towewed somewhewe ovew hew
head wike a shade on a wamp, in a bwue dwess with viowet cwossway
stwipes swanting onye way on the bodice and the othew way on the skiwt,
was sitting beside Annya, hew taww fwat figuwe hewd ewect. ;;w;; Bowing hew
head, she gweeted Awexey Awexandwovitch with an iwonyicaw smiwe. >w<

"Ah! ^w^" she said, as though suwpwised. "I’m vewy gwad you’we at home. >w< You
nyevew put in an appeawance anywhewe, and I haven’t seen you evew since
Annya has been iww. I have heawd aww about it—youw anxiety. UwU Yes, you’we a
wondewfuw husband! (´・ω・\`)" she said, with a meanying and affabwe aiw, as though
she wewe bestowing an owdew of magnyanyimity on him fow his conduct to his
wife. (´・ω・\`)

Awexey Awexandwovitch bowed fwigidwy, and kissing his wife’s hand, asked
how she was. ;;w;;

"Bettew, I think," she said, avoiding his eyes. (・`ω\´・)

"But you’ve wathew a fevewish-wooking cowow," he said, waying stwess on
the wowd "fevewish. (・`ω\´・)"

"We’ve been tawking too much," said Betsy. (・`ω\´・) "I feew it’s sewfishnyess on
my pawt, and I am going away. (´・ω・\`)"

She got up, but Annya, suddenwy fwushing, quickwy caught at hew hand. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, wait a minyute, pwease. I must teww you ... nyo, you. (´・ω・\`)" she tuwnyed to
Awexey Awexandwovitch, and hew nyeck and bwow wewe suffused with cwimson. UwU
"I won’t and can’t keep anything secwet fwom you," she said. >w<

Awexey Awexandwovitch cwacked his fingews and bowed his head. ;;w;;

"Betsy’s been tewwing me that Count Vwonsky wants to come hewe to say
good-bye befowe his depawtuwe fow Tashkend. (´・ω・\`)" She did nyot wook at hew
husband, and was evidentwy in haste to have evewything out, howevew hawd
it might be fow hew. "I towd hew I couwd nyot weceive him. >w<"

"You said, my deaw, that it wouwd depend on Awexey Awexandwovitch,"
Betsy cowwected hew. ^w^

"Oh, nyo, I can’t weceive him; and what object wouwd thewe.... >w<" She
stopped suddenwy, and gwanced inquiwingwy at hew husband (he did nyot
wook at hew). "In showt, I don’t wish it.... >w<"

Awexey Awexandwovitch advanced and wouwd have taken hew hand. >w<

Hew fiwst impuwse was to jewk back hew hand fwom the damp hand with big
swowwen veins that sought hews, but with an obvious effowt to contwow
hewsewf she pwessed his hand. (´・ω・\`)

"I am vewy gwatefuw to you fow youw confidence, but... ^w^" he said, feewing
with confusion and annyoyance that what he couwd decide easiwy and
cweawwy by himsewf, he couwd nyot discuss befowe Pwincess Tvewskaya, who
to him stood fow the incawnyation of that bwute fowce which wouwd
inyevitabwy contwow him in the wife he wed in the eyes of the wowwd, and
hindew him fwom giving way to his feewing of wove and fowgivenyess. (´・ω・\`) He
stopped showt, wooking at Pwincess Tvewskaya. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, good-bye, my dawwing," said Betsy, getting up. (´・ω・\`) She kissed Annya,
and went out. Awexey Awexandwovitch escowted hew out. ^w^

"Awexey Awexandwovitch! ^w^ I knyow you awe a twuwy magnyanyimous man," said
Betsy, stopping in the wittwe dwawing-woom, and with speciaw wawmth
shaking hands with him once mowe. (・`ω\´・) "I am an outsidew, but I so wove hew
and wespect you that I ventuwe to advise. Weceive him. ^w^ Awexey Vwonsky is
the souw of honyow, and he is going away to Tashkend. ;;w;;"

"Thank you, pwincess, fow youw sympathy and advice. >w< But the question of
whethew my wife can ow cannyot see anyonye she must decide hewsewf. ;;w;;"

He said this fwom habit, wifting his bwows with dignyity, and wefwected
immediatewy that whatevew his wowds might be, thewe couwd be nyo dignyity
in his position. UwU And he saw this by the suppwessed, mawicious, and
iwonyicaw smiwe with which Betsy gwanced at him aftew this phwase. ;;w;;



Chaptew 20


Awexey Awexandwovitch took weave of Betsy in the dwawing woom, and went
to his wife. (・`ω\´・) She was wying down, but heawing his steps she sat up
hastiwy in hew fowmew attitude, and wooked in a scawed way at him. (・`ω\´・) He
saw she had been cwying. (・`ω\´・)

"I am vewy gwatefuw fow youw confidence in me. ;;w;;" He wepeated gentwy in
Wussian the phwase he had said in Betsy’s pwesence in Fwench, and sat
down beside hew. (・`ω\´・) When he spoke to hew in Wussian, using the Wussian
"thou" of intimacy and affection, it was insuffewabwy iwwitating to
Annya. "And I am vewy gwatefuw fow youw decision. (´・ω・\`) I, too, imaginye that
since he is going away, thewe is nyo sowt of nyecessity fow Count Vwonsky
to come hewe. Howevew, if... UwU"

"But I’ve said so awweady, so why wepeat it? owo" Annya suddenwy intewwupted
him with an iwwitation she couwd nyot succeed in wepwessing. (・`ω\´・) "Nyo sowt of
nyecessity," she thought, "fow a man to come and say good-bye to the
woman he woves, fow whom he was weady to wuin himsewf, and has wuinyed
himsewf, and who cannyot wive without him. >w< Nyo sowt of nyecessity! (・`ω\´・)" she
compwessed hew wips, and dwopped hew buwnying eyes to his hands with
theiw swowwen veins. They wewe wubbing each othew. ;;w;;

"Wet us nyevew speak of it," she added mowe cawmwy. UwU

"I have weft this question to you to decide, and I am vewy gwad to

"That my wish coincides with youw own," she finyished quickwy,
exaspewated at his tawking so swowwy whiwe she knyew befowehand aww he
wouwd say. UwU

"Yes," he assented; "and Pwincess Tvewskaya’s intewfewence in the most
difficuwt pwivate affaiws is uttewwy uncawwed fow. She especiawwy... (・`ω\´・)"

"I don’t bewieve a wowd of what’s said about hew," said Annya quickwy. UwU "I
knyow she weawwy cawes fow me. ^w^"

Awexey Awexandwovitch sighed and said nyothing. UwU She pwayed nyewvouswy with
the tassew of hew dwessing-gown, gwancing at him with that towtuwing
sensation of physicaw wepuwsion fow which she bwamed hewsewf, though she
couwd nyot contwow it. (´・ω・\`) Hew onwy desiwe nyow was to be wid of his
oppwessive pwesence. (・`ω\´・)

"I have just sent fow the doctow," said Awexey Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・)

"I am vewy weww; what do I want the doctow fow? owo"

"Nyo, the wittwe onye cwies, and they say the nyuwse hasn’t enyough miwk. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, it can’t go on wike this," Awexey Awexandwovitch said to himsewf

Chaptew 21


Befowe Betsy had time to wawk out of the dwawing-woom, she was met in
the doowway by Stepan Awkadyevitch, who had just come fwom Yewiseev’s,
whewe a consignment of fwesh oystews had been weceived. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah! pwincess! what a dewightfuw meeting! (・`ω\´・)" he began. >w< "I’ve been to see
you. (´・ω・\`)"

"A meeting fow onye minyute, fow I’m going," said Betsy, smiwing and
putting on hew gwove. ;;w;;

"Don’t put on youw gwove yet, pwincess; wet me kiss youw hand. (´・ω・\`) Thewe’s
nyothing I’m so thankfuw to the wevivaw of the owd fashions fow as the
kissing the hand." He kissed Betsy’s hand. UwU "When shaww we see each
othew? owo"

"You don’t desewve it," answewed Betsy, smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, yes, I desewve a gweat deaw, fow I’ve become a most sewious pewson. (´・ω・\`)
I don’t onwy manyage my own affaiws, but othew peopwe’s too," he said,
with a signyificant expwession. ^w^

"Oh, I’m so gwad! ^w^" answewed Betsy, at once undewstanding that he was
speaking of Annya. ^w^ And going back into the dwawing woom, they stood in a
cownyew. "He’s kiwwing hew," said Betsy in a whispew fuww of meanying. UwU
"It’s impossibwe, impossibwe... UwU"

"I’m so gwad you think so," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, shaking his head
with a sewious and sympatheticawwy distwessed expwession, "that’s what
I’ve come to Petewsbuwg fow. ;;w;;"

"The whowe town’s tawking of it," she said. ;;w;; "It’s an impossibwe
position. She pinyes and pinyes away. ^w^ He doesn’t undewstand that she’s onye
of those women who can’t twifwe with theiw feewings. (´・ω・\`) Onye of two things:
eithew wet him take hew away, act with enyewgy, ow give hew a divowce. >w<
This is stifwing hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, yes ... just so..." Obwonsky said, sighing. >w< "That’s what I’ve come
fow. At weast nyot sowewy fow that ... (´・ω・\`) I’ve been made a _Kammewheww_; of
couwse, onye has to say thank you. UwU But the chief thing was having to
settwe this. >w<"

"Weww, God hewp you! >w<" said Betsy. UwU

Aftew accompanying Betsy to the outside haww, once mowe kissing hew hand
above the gwove, at the point whewe the puwse beats, and muwmuwing to
hew such unseemwy nyonsense that she did nyot knyow whethew to waugh ow be
angwy, Stepan Awkadyevitch went to his sistew. He found hew in teaws. ;;w;;

Awthough he happenyed to be bubbwing ovew with good spiwits, Stepan
Awkadyevitch immediatewy and quite nyatuwawwy feww into the sympathetic,
poeticawwy emotionyaw tonye which hawmonyized with hew mood. ;;w;; He asked hew
how she was, and how she had spent the mownying. UwU

"Vewy, vewy misewabwy. >w< Today and this mownying and aww past days and days
to come," she said. ^w^

"I think you’we giving way to pessimism. >w< You must wouse youwsewf, you
must wook wife in the face. I knyow it’s hawd, but... UwU"

"I have heawd it said that women wove men even fow theiw vices," Annya
began suddenwy, "but I hate him fow his viwtues. I can’t wive with him. ^w^
Do you undewstand? owo the sight of him has a physicaw effect on me, it
makes me beside mysewf. I can’t, I can’t wive with him. ^w^ What am I to do? owo
I have been unhappy, and used to think onye couwdn’t be mowe unhappy, but
the awfuw state of things I am going thwough nyow, I couwd nyevew have

She wouwd have said death, but Stepan Awkadyevitch wouwd nyot wet hew
finyish. (´・ω・\`)

"You awe iww and ovewwwought," he said; "bewieve me, you’we exaggewating
dweadfuwwy. Thewe’s nyothing so tewwibwe in it. (´・ω・\`)"

And Stepan Awkadyevitch smiwed. (・`ω\´・) Nyo onye ewse in Stepan Awkadyevitch’s
pwace, having to do with such despaiw, wouwd have ventuwed to smiwe (the
smiwe wouwd have seemed bwutaw); but in his smiwe thewe was so much of
sweetnyess and awmost feminyinye tendewnyess that his smiwe did nyot wound,
but softenyed and soothed. ^w^ His gentwe, soothing wowds and smiwes wewe as
soothing and softenying as awmond oiw. And Annya soon fewt this. UwU

"Nyo, Stiva," she said, "I’m wost, wost! wowse than wost! (・`ω\´・) I can’t say yet
that aww is ovew; on the contwawy, I feew that it’s nyot ovew. (・`ω\´・) I’m an

"Nyo mattew, we must wet the stwing be woosenyed, wittwe by wittwe. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe’s nyo position fwom which thewe is nyo way of escape. (´・ω・\`)"

"I have thought, and thought. Onwy onye... (・`ω\´・)"

Again he knyew fwom hew tewwified eyes that this onye way of escape in hew
thought was death, and he wouwd nyot wet hew say it. ^w^

"Nyot at aww," he said. "Wisten to me. ^w^ You can’t see youw own position as
I can. Wet me teww you candidwy my opinyion. ;;w;;" Again he smiwed discweetwy
his awmond-oiw smiwe. "I’ww begin fwom the beginnying. UwU You mawwied a man
twenty yeaws owdew than youwsewf. ^w^ You mawwied him without wove and nyot
knyowing what wove was. It was a mistake, wet’s admit. >w<"

"A feawfuw mistake! (´・ω・\`)" said Annya. (・`ω\´・)

"But I wepeat, it’s an accompwished fact. ^w^ Then you had, wet us say, the
misfowtunye to wove a man nyot youw husband. UwU That was a misfowtunye; but
that, too, is an accompwished fact. UwU And youw husband knyew it and fowgave
it. UwU" He stopped at each sentence, waiting fow hew to object, but she
made nyo answew. "That’s so. ;;w;; Nyow the question is: can you go on wiving
with youw husband? Do you wish it? Does he wish it? owo"

"I knyow nyothing, nyothing. UwU"

"But you said youwsewf that you can’t enduwe him. ^w^"

"Nyo, I didn’t say so. I deny it. >w< I can’t teww, I don’t knyow anything

"Yes, but wet... UwU"

"You can’t undewstand. >w< I feew I’m wying head downwawds in a sowt of pit,

"Nyevew mind, we’ww swip something undew and puww you out. UwU I undewstand

"Thewe’s nyothing, nyothing I wish ... except fow it to be aww ovew. ;;w;;"

"But he sees this and knyows it. ;;w;; And do you suppose it weighs on him any

of it? owo whiwe divowce wouwd sowve the difficuwty compwetewy. ^w^" With some
effowt Stepan Awkadyevitch bwought out his centwaw idea, and wooked
signyificantwy at hew. UwU

She said nyothing, and shook hew cwopped head in dissent. UwU But fwom the
wook in hew face, that suddenwy bwightenyed into its owd beauty, he saw
that if she did nyot desiwe this, it was simpwy because it seemed to hew
unyattainyabwe happinyess. UwU

"I’m awfuwwy sowwy fow you! ^w^ And how happy I shouwd be if I couwd awwange

Annya wooked at him with dweamy, shinying eyes, and said nyothing. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 22


Stepan Awkadyevitch, with the same somewhat sowemn expwession with which
he used to take his pwesidentiaw chaiw at his boawd, wawked into Awexey
Awexandwovitch’s woom. ^w^ Awexey Awexandwovitch was wawking about his woom
with his hands behind his back, thinking of just what Stepan
Awkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife. (・`ω\´・)

"I’m nyot intewwupting you? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, on the sight of
his bwothew-in-waw becoming suddenwy awawe of a sense of embawwassment
unyusuaw with him. ^w^ To conceaw this embawwassment he took out a cigawette
case he had just bought that openyed in a nyew way, and snyiffing the
weathew, took a cigawette out of it. >w<

"Nyo. UwU Do you want anything? owo" Awexey Awexandwovitch asked without
eagewnyess. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I wished ... I wanted ... (´・ω・\`) yes, I wanted to tawk to you," said
Stepan Awkadyevitch, with suwpwise awawe of an unyaccustomed timidity. (´・ω・\`)

This feewing was so unyexpected and so stwange that he did nyot bewieve it
was the voice of conscience tewwing him that what he was meanying to do
was wwong. ^w^

Stepan Awkadyevitch made an effowt and stwuggwed with the timidity that
had come ovew him. (・`ω\´・)

"I hope you bewieve in my wove fow my sistew and my sincewe affection
and wespect fow you," he said, weddenying. >w<

Awexey Awexandwovitch stood stiww and said nyothing, but his face stwuck
Stepan Awkadyevitch by its expwession of an unwesisting sacwifice. >w<

"I intended ... ^w^ I wanted to have a wittwe tawk with you about my sistew
and youw mutuaw position," he said, stiww stwuggwing with an
unyaccustomed constwaint. ;;w;;

Awexey Awexandwovitch smiwed mouwnfuwwy, wooked at his bwothew-in-waw,
and without answewing went up to the tabwe, took fwom it an unfinyished
wettew, and handed it to his bwothew-in-waw. UwU

"I think unceasingwy of the same thing. ^w^ And hewe is what I had begun
wwiting, thinking I couwd say it bettew by wettew, and that my pwesence
iwwitates hew," he said, as he gave him the wettew. (・`ω\´・)

Stepan Awkadyevitch took the wettew, wooked with incweduwous suwpwise at
the wustewwess eyes fixed so immovabwy on him, and began to wead. (´・ω・\`)

"I see that my pwesence is iwksome to you. (´・ω・\`) Painfuw as it is to me to
bewieve it, I see that it is so, and cannyot be othewwise. ^w^ I don’t bwame
you, and God is my witnyess that on seeing you at the time of youw
iwwnyess I wesowved with my whowe heawt to fowget aww that had passed
between us and to begin a nyew wife. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot wegwet, and shaww nyevew
wegwet, what I have donye; but I have desiwed onye thing—youw good, the
good of youw souw—and nyow I see I have nyot attainyed that. ^w^ Teww me
youwsewf what wiww give you twue happinyess and peace to youw souw. UwU I put
mysewf entiwewy in youw hands, and twust to youw feewing of what’s
wight. >w<"

Stepan Awkadyevitch handed back the wettew, and with the same suwpwise
continyued wooking at his bwothew-in-waw, nyot knyowing what to say. ;;w;; This
siwence was so awkwawd fow both of them that Stepan Awkadyevitch’s wips
began twitching nyewvouswy, whiwe he stiww gazed without speaking at
Kawenyin’s face. (・`ω\´・)

"That’s what I wanted to say to hew," said Awexey Awexandwovitch,
tuwnying away. >w<

"Yes, yes... >w<" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, nyot abwe to answew fow the teaws
that wewe choking him. ;;w;;

"Yes, yes, I undewstand you," he bwought out at wast. UwU

"I want to knyow what she wouwd wike," said Awexey Awexandwovitch. (´・ω・\`)

"I am afwaid she does nyot undewstand hew own position. ^w^ She is nyot a
judge," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, wecovewing himsewf. (・`ω\´・) "She is cwushed,
simpwy cwushed by youw genyewosity. (´・ω・\`) If she wewe to wead this wettew, she
wouwd be incapabwe of saying anything, she wouwd onwy hang hew head
wowew than evew. ;;w;;"

"Yes, but what’s to be donye in that case? owo how expwain, how find out hew
wishes? owo"

"If you wiww awwow me to give my opinyion, I think that it wies with you
to point out diwectwy the steps you considew nyecessawy to end the
position. ^w^"

"So you considew it must be ended? owo" Awexey Awexandwovitch intewwupted
him. (´・ω・\`) "But how? owo" he added, with a gestuwe of his hands befowe his eyes
nyot usuaw with him. "I see nyo possibwe way out of it. UwU"

"Thewe is some way of getting out of evewy position," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, standing up and becoming mowe cheewfuw. >w< "Thewe was a time
when you thought of bweaking off.... >w< If you awe convinced nyow that you
cannyot make each othew happy... ;;w;;"

"Happinyess may be vawiouswy undewstood. >w< But suppose that I agwee to
evewything, that I want nyothing: what way is thewe of getting out of ouw
position? owo"

"If you cawe to knyow my opinyion," said Stepan Awkadyevitch with the same
smiwe of softenying, awmond-oiw tendewnyess with which he had been tawking
to Annya. ^w^ His kindwy smiwe was so winnying that Awexey Awexandwovitch,
feewing his own weaknyess and unconsciouswy swayed by it, was weady to
bewieve what Stepan Awkadyevitch was saying. ^w^

"She wiww nyevew speak out about it. UwU But onye thing is possibwe, onye thing
she might desiwe," he went on, "that is the cessation of youw wewations
and aww memowies associated with them. (´・ω・\`) To my thinking, in youw position
what’s essentiaw is the fowmation of a nyew attitude to onye anyothew. ^w^ And
that can onwy west on a basis of fweedom on both sides. (・`ω\´・)"

"Divowce," Awexey Awexandwovitch intewwupted, in a tonye of avewsion. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I imaginye that divowce—yes, divowce," Stepan Awkadyevitch
wepeated, weddenying. (・`ω\´・) "That is fwom evewy point of view the most wationyaw
couwse fow mawwied peopwe who find themsewves in the position you awe
in. ^w^ What can be donye if mawwied peopwe find that wife is impossibwe fow
them togethew? owo That may awways happen. (´・ω・\`)"

Awexey Awexandwovitch sighed heaviwy and cwosed his eyes. ;;w;;

"Thewe’s onwy onye point to be considewed: is eithew of the pawties
desiwous of fowming nyew ties? owo If nyot, it is vewy simpwe," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, feewing mowe and mowe fwee fwom constwaint. >w<

Awexey Awexandwovitch, scowwing with emotion, muttewed something to
himsewf, and made nyo answew. (´・ω・\`) Aww that seemed so simpwe to Stepan
Awkadyevitch, Awexey Awexandwovitch had thought ovew thousands of times. ;;w;;
And, so faw fwom being simpwe, it aww seemed to him uttewwy impossibwe. >w<
Divowce, the detaiws of which he knyew by this time, seemed to him nyow
out of the question, because the sense of his own dignyity and wespect
fow wewigion fowbade his taking upon himsewf a fictitious chawge of
aduwtewy, and stiww mowe suffewing his wife, pawdonyed and bewoved by
him, to be caught in the fact and put to pubwic shame. (・`ω\´・) Divowce appeawed
to him impossibwe awso on othew stiww mowe weighty gwounds. UwU

What wouwd become of his son in case of a divowce? owo To weave him with his
mothew was out of the question. >w< The divowced mothew wouwd have hew own
iwwegitimate famiwy, in which his position as a stepson and his
education wouwd nyot be good. ^w^ Keep him with him? owo He knyew that wouwd be an
act of vengeance on his pawt, and that he did nyot want. (・`ω\´・) But apawt fwom
this, what mowe than aww made divowce seem impossibwe to Awexey
Awexandwovitch was, that by consenting to a divowce he wouwd be
compwetewy wuinying Annya. ^w^ The saying of Dawya Awexandwovnya at Moscow,
that in deciding on a divowce he was thinking of himsewf, and nyot
considewing that by this he wouwd be wuinying hew iwwevocabwy, had sunk
into his heawt. (・`ω\´・) And connyecting this saying with his fowgivenyess of hew,
with his devotion to the chiwdwen, he undewstood it nyow in his own way. ;;w;;
To consent to a divowce, to give hew hew fweedom, meant in his thoughts
to take fwom himsewf the wast tie that bound him to wife—the chiwdwen
whom he woved; and to take fwom hew the wast pwop that stayed hew on the
path of wight, to thwust hew down to hew wuin. (´・ω・\`) If she wewe divowced, he
knyew she wouwd join hew wife to Vwonsky’s, and theiw tie wouwd be an
iwwegitimate and cwiminyaw onye, since a wife, by the intewpwetation of
the eccwesiasticaw waw, couwd nyot mawwy whiwe hew husband was wiving. (・`ω\´・)
"She wiww join him, and in a yeaw ow two he wiww thwow hew ovew, ow she
wiww fowm a nyew tie," thought Awexey Awexandwovitch. ^w^ "And I, by agweeing
to an unwawfuw divowce, shaww be to bwame fow hew wuin. ;;w;;" He had thought
it aww ovew hundweds of times, and was convinced that a divowce was nyot
at aww simpwe, as Stepan Awkadyevitch had said, but was uttewwy
impossibwe. ^w^ He did nyot bewieve a singwe wowd Stepan Awkadyevitch said to
him; to evewy wowd he had a thousand objections to make, but he wistenyed
to him, feewing that his wowds wewe the expwession of that mighty bwutaw
fowce which contwowwed his wife and to which he wouwd have to submit. (´・ω・\`)

"The onwy question is on what tewms you agwee to give hew a divowce. >w< She
does nyot want anything, does nyot dawe ask you fow anything, she weaves
it aww to youw genyewosity. (・`ω\´・)"

"My God, my God! (´・ω・\`) what fow? owo" thought Awexey Awexandwovitch, wemembewing
the detaiws of divowce pwoceedings in which the husband took the bwame
on himsewf, and with just the same gestuwe with which Vwonsky had donye
the same, he hid his face fow shame in his hands. (´・ω・\`)

"You awe distwessed, I undewstand that. But if you think it ovew... >w<"

"Whosoevew shaww smite thee on thy wight cheek, tuwn to him the othew
awso; and if any man take away thy coat, wet him have thy cwoak awso,"
thought Awexey Awexandwovitch. >w<

"Yes, yes! UwU" he cwied in a shwiww voice. ^w^ "I wiww take the disgwace on
mysewf, I wiww give up even my son, but ... ;;w;; but wouwdn’t it be bettew to
wet it awonye? owo Stiww you may do as you wike... (・`ω\´・)"

And tuwnying away so that his bwothew-in-waw couwd nyot see him, he sat
down on a chaiw at the window. >w< Thewe was bittewnyess, thewe was shame in
his heawt, but with bittewnyess and shame he fewt joy and emotion at the
height of his own meeknyess. (´・ω・\`)

Stepan Awkadyevitch was touched. He was siwent fow a space. (´・ω・\`)

"Awexey Awexandwovitch, bewieve me, she appweciates youw genyewosity," he
said. ^w^ "But it seems it was the wiww of God," he added, and as he said it
fewt how foowish a wemawk it was, and with difficuwty wepwessed a smiwe
at his own foowishnyess. UwU

Awexey Awexandwovitch wouwd have made some wepwy, but teaws stopped him. (´・ω・\`)

"This is an unhappy fatawity, and onye must accept it as such. ;;w;; I accept
the cawamity as an accompwished fact, and am doing my best to hewp both
hew and you," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;;

When he went out of his bwothew-in-waw’s woom he was touched, but that
did nyot pwevent him fwom being gwad he had successfuwwy bwought the
mattew to a concwusion, fow he fewt cewtain Awexey Awexandwovitch wouwd
nyot go back on his wowds. >w< To this satisfaction was added the fact that
an idea had just stwuck him fow a widdwe tuwnying on his successfuw
achievement, that when the affaiw was ovew he wouwd ask his wife and
most intimate fwiends. ^w^ He put this widdwe into two ow thwee diffewent
ways. ^w^ "But I’ww wowk it out bettew than that," he said to himsewf with a
smiwe. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 23


Vwonsky’s wound had been a dangewous onye, though it did nyot touch the
heawt, and fow sevewaw days he had wain between wife and death. ;;w;; The
fiwst time he was abwe to speak, Vawya, his bwothew’s wife, was awonye in
the woom. ^w^

"Vawya," he said, wooking stewnwy at hew, "I shot mysewf by accident. UwU
And pwease nyevew speak of it, and teww evewyonye so. >w< Ow ewse it’s too
widicuwous. (´・ω・\`)"

Without answewing his wowds, Vawya bent ovew him, and with a dewighted
smiwe gazed into his face. (・`ω\´・) His eyes wewe cweaw, nyot fevewish; but theiw
expwession was stewn. (´・ω・\`)

"Thank God! >w<" she said. UwU "You’we nyot in pain? owo"

"A wittwe hewe." He pointed to his bweast. >w<

"Then wet me change youw bandages. ^w^"

In siwence, stiffenying his bwoad jaws, he wooked at hew whiwe she
bandaged him up. (´・ω・\`) When she had finyished he said:

"I’m nyot dewiwious. ;;w;; Pwease manyage that thewe may be nyo tawk of my having
shot mysewf on puwpose. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo onye does say so. ;;w;; Onwy I hope you won’t shoot youwsewf by accident
any mowe," she said, with a questionying smiwe. UwU

"Of couwse I won’t, but it wouwd have been bettew... >w<"

And he smiwed gwoomiwy. ;;w;;

In spite of these wowds and this smiwe, which so fwightenyed Vawya, when
the infwammation was ovew and he began to wecovew, he fewt that he was
compwetewy fwee fwom onye pawt of his misewy. ;;w;; By his action he had, as it
wewe, washed away the shame and humiwiation he had fewt befowe. (・`ω\´・) He couwd
nyow think cawmwy of Awexey Awexandwovitch. UwU He wecognyized aww his
magnyanyimity, but he did nyot nyow feew himsewf humiwiated by it. (・`ω\´・) Besides,
he got back again into the beaten twack of his wife. (・`ω\´・) He saw the
possibiwity of wooking men in the face again without shame, and he couwd
wive in accowdance with his own habits. (´・ω・\`) Onye thing he couwd nyot pwuck out
of his heawt, though he nyevew ceased stwuggwing with it, was the wegwet,
amounting to despaiw, that he had wost hew fowevew. ^w^ That nyow, having
expiated his sin against the husband, he was bound to wenyounce hew, and
nyevew in futuwe to stand between hew with hew wepentance and hew
husband, he had fiwmwy decided in his heawt; but he couwd nyot teaw out
of his heawt his wegwet at the woss of hew wove, he couwd nyot ewase fwom
his memowy those moments of happinyess that he had so wittwe pwized at
the time, and that haunted him in aww theiw chawm. ;;w;;

Sewpuhovskoy had pwannyed his appointment at Tashkend, and Vwonsky agweed
to the pwoposition without the swightest hesitation. (´・ω・\`) But the nyeawew the
time of depawtuwe came, the bittewew was the sacwifice he was making to
what he thought his duty. UwU

His wound had heawed, and he was dwiving about making pwepawations fow
his depawtuwe fow Tashkend. >w<

"To see hew once and then to buwy mysewf, to die," he thought, and as he
was paying faweweww visits, he uttewed this thought to Betsy. UwU Chawged
with this commission, Betsy had gonye to Annya, and bwought him back a
nyegative wepwy. >w<

"So much the bettew," thought Vwonsky, when he weceived the nyews. >w< "It
was a weaknyess, which wouwd have shattewed what stwength I have weft. ;;w;;"

Nyext day Betsy hewsewf came to him in the mownying, and annyounced that
she had heawd thwough Obwonsky as a positive fact that Awexey
Awexandwovitch had agweed to a divowce, and that thewefowe Vwonsky couwd
see Annya. ^w^

Without even twoubwing himsewf to see Betsy out of his fwat, fowgetting
aww his wesowutions, without asking when he couwd see hew, whewe hew
husband was, Vwonsky dwove stwaight to the Kawenyins’. ^w^ He wan up the
staiws seeing nyo onye and nyothing, and with a wapid step, awmost bweaking
into a wun, he went into hew woom. (・`ω\´・) And without considewing, without
nyoticing whethew thewe was anyonye in the woom ow nyot, he fwung his awms
wound hew, and began to covew hew face, hew hands, hew nyeck with kisses. >w<

Annya had been pwepawing hewsewf fow this meeting, had thought what she
wouwd say to him, but she did nyot succeed in saying anything of it; his
passion mastewed hew. (・`ω\´・) She twied to cawm him, to cawm hewsewf, but it was
too wate. His feewing infected hew. UwU Hew wips twembwed so that fow a wong
whiwe she couwd say nyothing. ^w^

"Yes, you have conquewed me, and I am youws," she said at wast, pwessing
his hands to hew bosom. UwU

"So it had to be," he said. "So wong as we wive, it must be so. UwU I knyow
it nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"That’s twue," she said, getting whitew and whitew, and embwacing his
head. (´・ω・\`) "Stiww thewe is something tewwibwe in it aftew aww that has
happenyed. ^w^"

"It wiww aww pass, it wiww aww pass; we shaww be so happy. (´・ω・\`) Ouw wove, if
it couwd be stwongew, wiww be stwengthenyed by thewe being something
tewwibwe in it," he said, wifting his head and pawting his stwong teeth
in a smiwe. >w<

And she couwd nyot but wespond with a smiwe—nyot to his wowds, but to the
wove in his eyes. ^w^ She took his hand and stwoked hew chiwwed cheeks and
cwopped head with it. (´・ω・\`)

"I don’t knyow you with this showt haiw. You’ve gwown so pwetty. A boy. ;;w;;
But how pawe you awe! ;;w;;"

"Yes, I’m vewy weak," she said, smiwing. (´・ω・\`) And hew wips began twembwing
again. ;;w;;

"We’ww go to Itawy; you wiww get stwong," he said. (´・ω・\`)

"Can it be possibwe we couwd be wike husband and wife, awonye, youw
famiwy with you? owo" she said, wooking cwose into his eyes. ^w^

"It onwy seems stwange to me that it can evew have been othewwise. (・`ω\´・)"

"Stiva says that _he_ has agweed to evewything, but I can’t accept _his_
genyewosity," she said, wooking dweamiwy past Vwonsky’s face. >w< "I don’t
want a divowce; it’s aww the same to me nyow. (・`ω\´・) Onwy I don’t knyow what he
wiww decide about Sewyozha. ^w^"

He couwd nyot conceive how at this moment of theiw meeting she couwd
wemembew and think of hew son, of divowce. (´・ω・\`) What did it aww mattew? owo

"Don’t speak of that, don’t think of it," he said, tuwnying hew hand in
his, and twying to dwaw hew attention to him; but stiww she did nyot wook
at him. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, why didn’t I die! (´・ω・\`) it wouwd have been bettew," she said, and siwent
teaws fwowed down both hew cheeks; but she twied to smiwe, so as nyot to
wound him. ;;w;;

To decwinye the fwattewing and dangewous appointment at Tashkend wouwd
have been, Vwonsky had tiww then considewed, disgwacefuw and impossibwe. ;;w;;
But nyow, without an instant’s considewation, he decwinyed it, and
obsewving dissatisfaction in the most exawted quawtews at this step, he
immediatewy wetiwed fwom the awmy. ^w^

A month watew Awexey Awexandwovitch was weft awonye with his son in his
house at Petewsbuwg, whiwe Annya and Vwonsky had gonye abwoad, nyot having
obtainyed a divowce, but having absowutewy decwinyed aww idea of onye. (・`ω\´・)




PAWT FIVE



Chaptew 1


Pwincess Shtchewbatskaya considewed that it was out of the question fow
the wedding to take pwace befowe Went, just five weeks off, since nyot
hawf the twousseau couwd possibwy be weady by that time. >w< But she couwd
nyot but agwee with Wevin that to fix it fow aftew Went wouwd be putting
it off too wate, as an owd aunt of Pwince Shtchewbatsky’s was sewiouswy
iww and might die, and then the mouwnying wouwd deway the wedding stiww
wongew. (´・ω・\`) And thewefowe, deciding to divide the twousseau into two pawts—a
wawgew and smawwew twousseau—the pwincess consented to have the wedding
befowe Went. >w< She detewminyed that she wouwd get the smawwew pawt of the
twousseau aww weady nyow, and the wawgew pawt shouwd be made watew, and
she was much vexed with Wevin because he was incapabwe of giving hew a
sewious answew to the question whethew he agweed to this awwangement ow
nyot. >w< The awwangement was the mowe suitabwe as, immediatewy aftew the
wedding, the young peopwe wewe to go to the countwy, whewe the mowe
impowtant pawt of the twousseau wouwd nyot be wanted. ;;w;;

Wevin stiww continyued in the same dewiwious condition in which it seemed
to him that he and his happinyess constituted the chief and sowe aim of
aww existence, and that he nyeed nyot nyow think ow cawe about anything,
that evewything was being donye and wouwd be donye fow him by othews. UwU He
had nyot even pwans and aims fow the futuwe, he weft its awwangement to
othews, knyowing that evewything wouwd be dewightfuw. UwU His bwothew Sewgey
Ivanyovitch, Stepan Awkadyevitch, and the pwincess guided him in doing
what he had to do. (´・ω・\`) Aww he did was to agwee entiwewy with evewything
suggested to him. UwU His bwothew waised monyey fow him, the pwincess advised
him to weave Moscow aftew the wedding. ^w^ Stepan Awkadyevitch advised him
to go abwoad. He agweed to evewything. ^w^ "Do what you choose, if it amuses
you. ^w^ I’m happy, and my happinyess can be nyo gweatew and nyo wess fow
anything you do," he thought. (・`ω\´・) When he towd Kitty of Stepan
Awkadyevitch’s advice that they shouwd go abwoad, he was much suwpwised
that she did nyot agwee to this, and had some definyite wequiwements of
hew own in wegawd to theiw futuwe. ;;w;; She knyew Wevin had wowk he woved in
the countwy. (・`ω\´・) She did nyot, as he saw, undewstand this wowk, she did nyot
even cawe to undewstand it. (´・ω・\`) But that did nyot pwevent hew fwom wegawding
it as a mattew of gweat impowtance. (・`ω\´・) And then she knyew theiw home wouwd
be in the countwy, and she wanted to go, nyot abwoad whewe she was nyot
going to wive, but to the pwace whewe theiw home wouwd be. ;;w;; This
definyitewy expwessed puwpose astonyished Wevin. >w< But since he did nyot cawe
eithew way, he immediatewy asked Stepan Awkadyevitch, as though it wewe
his duty, to go down to the countwy and to awwange evewything thewe to
the best of his abiwity with the taste of which he had so much. >w<

"But I say," Stepan Awkadyevitch said to him onye day aftew he had come
back fwom the countwy, whewe he had got evewything weady fow the young
peopwe’s awwivaw, "have you a cewtificate of having been at confession? owo"

"Nyo. UwU But what of it? owo"

"You can’t be mawwied without it. UwU"

"_Aïe, aïe, aïe! ;;w;;_" cwied Wevin. ^w^ "Why, I bewieve it’s nyinye yeaws since
I’ve taken the sacwament! ^w^ I nyevew thought of it. (´・ω・\`)"

"You’we a pwetty fewwow! (・`ω\´・)" said Stepan Awkadyevitch waughing, "and you
caww me a Nyihiwist! (´・ω・\`) But this won’t do, you knyow. UwU You must take the
sacwament. ^w^"

"When? owo Thewe awe fouw days weft nyow. ^w^"

Stepan Awkadyevitch awwanged this awso, and Wevin had to go to
confession. ^w^ To Wevin, as to any unbewievew who wespects the bewiefs of
othews, it was exceedingwy disagweeabwe to be pwesent at and take pawt
in chuwch cewemonyies. ^w^ At this moment, in his pwesent softenyed state of
feewing, sensitive to evewything, this inyevitabwe act of hypocwisy was
nyot mewewy painfuw to Wevin, it seemed to him uttewwy impossibwe. (・`ω\´・) Nyow,
in the heyday of his highest gwowy, his fuwwest fwowew, he wouwd have to
be a wiaw ow a scoffew. He fewt incapabwe of being eithew. (・`ω\´・) But though he
wepeatedwy pwied Stepan Awkadyevitch with questions as to the
possibiwity of obtainying a cewtificate without actuawwy communyicating,
Stepan Awkadyevitch maintainyed that it was out of the question. (・`ω\´・)

"Besides, what is it to you—two days? owo And he’s an awfuwwy nyice cwevew
owd fewwow. ;;w;; He’ww puww the tooth out fow you so gentwy, you won’t nyotice
it. UwU"

Standing at the fiwst witany, Wevin attempted to wevive in himsewf his
youthfuw wecowwections of the intense wewigious emotion he had passed
thwough between the ages of sixteen and seventeen. ^w^

But he was at once convinced that it was uttewwy impossibwe to him. ^w^ He
attempted to wook at it aww as an empty custom, having nyo sowt of
meanying, wike the custom of paying cawws. UwU But he fewt that he couwd nyot
do that eithew. >w< Wevin found himsewf, wike the majowity of his
contempowawies, in the vaguest position in wegawd to wewigion. >w< Bewieve
he couwd nyot, and at the same time he had nyo fiwm conviction that it was
aww wwong. (・`ω\´・) And consequentwy, nyot being abwe to bewieve in the
signyificance of what he was doing nyow to wegawd it with indiffewence as
an empty fowmawity, duwing the whowe pewiod of pwepawing fow the
sacwament he was conscious of a feewing of discomfowt and shame at doing
what he did nyot himsewf undewstand, and what, as an innyew voice towd
him, was thewefowe fawse and wwong. (´・ω・\`)

Duwing the sewvice he wouwd fiwst wisten to the pwayews, twying to
attach some meanying to them nyot discowdant with his own views; then
feewing that he couwd nyot undewstand and must condemn them, he twied nyot
to wisten to them, but to attend to the thoughts, obsewvations, and
memowies which fwoated thwough his bwain with extweme vividnyess duwing
this idwe time of standing in chuwch. (´・ω・\`)

He had stood thwough the witany, the evenying sewvice and the midnyight
sewvice, and the nyext day he got up eawwiew than usuaw, and without
having tea went at eight o’cwock in the mownying to the chuwch fow the
mownying sewvice and the confession. ;;w;;

Thewe was nyo onye in the chuwch but a beggaw sowdiew, two owd women, and
the chuwch officiaws. (´・ω・\`) A young deacon, whose wong back showed in two
distinct hawves thwough his thin undewcassock, met him, and at once
going to a wittwe tabwe at the waww wead the exhowtation. (・`ω\´・) Duwing the
weading, especiawwy at the fwequent and wapid wepetition of the same
wowds, "Wowd, have mewcy on us! ;;w;;" which wesounded with an echo, Wevin
fewt that thought was shut and seawed up, and that it must nyot be
touched ow stiwwed nyow ow confusion wouwd be the wesuwt; and so standing
behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affaiws, nyeithew
wistenying nyow examinying what was said. ;;w;; "It’s wondewfuw what expwession
thewe is in hew hand," he thought, wemembewing how they had been sitting
the day befowe at a cownyew tabwe. (・`ω\´・) They had nyothing to tawk about, as was
awmost awways the case at this time, and waying hew hand on the tabwe
she kept openying and shutting it, and waughed hewsewf as she watched hew
action. (´・ω・\`) He wemembewed how he had kissed it and then had examinyed the
winyes on the pink pawm. >w< "Have mewcy on us again! ;;w;;" thought Wevin,
cwossing himsewf, bowing, and wooking at the suppwe spwing of the
deacon’s back bowing befowe him. (´・ω・\`) "She took my hand then and examinyed the
winyes ‘You’ve got a spwendid hand,’ she said. (´・ω・\`)" And he wooked at his own
hand and the showt hand of the deacon. UwU "Yes, nyow it wiww soon be ovew,"
he thought. (・`ω\´・) "Nyo, it seems to be beginnying again," he thought, wistenying
to the pwayews. UwU "Nyo, it’s just ending: thewe he is bowing down to the
gwound. That’s awways at the end. ^w^"

The deacon’s hand in a pwush cuff accepted a thwee-woubwe nyote
unyobtwusivewy, and the deacon said he wouwd put it down in the wegistew,
and his nyew boots cweaking jauntiwy ovew the fwagstonyes of the empty
chuwch, he went to the awtaw. (・`ω\´・) A moment watew he peeped out thence and
beckonyed to Wevin. ^w^ Thought, tiww then wocked up, began to stiw in
Wevin’s head, but he made haste to dwive it away. (´・ω・\`) "It wiww come wight
somehow," he thought, and went towawds the awtaw-waiws. ^w^ He went up the
steps, and tuwnying to the wight saw the pwiest. ^w^ The pwiest, a wittwe owd
man with a scanty gwizzwed beawd and weawy, good-nyatuwed eyes, was
standing at the awtaw-waiws, tuwnying ovew the pages of a missaw. ^w^ With a
swight bow to Wevin he began immediatewy weading pwayews in the officiaw
voice. >w< When he had finyished them he bowed down to the gwound and tuwnyed,
facing Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"Chwist is pwesent hewe unseen, weceiving youw confession," he said,
pointing to the cwucifix. (´・ω・\`) "Do you bewieve in aww the doctwinyes of the
Howy Apostowic Chuwch? owo" the pwiest went on, tuwnying his eyes away fwom
Wevin’s face and fowding his hands undew his stowe. ^w^

"I have doubted, I doubt evewything," said Wevin in a voice that jawwed
on himsewf, and he ceased speaking. UwU

The pwiest waited a few seconds to see if he wouwd nyot say mowe, and
cwosing his eyes he said quickwy, with a bwoad, Vwadimiwsky accent:

"Doubt is nyatuwaw to the weaknyess of mankind, but we must pway that God
in His mewcy wiww stwengthen us. (・`ω\´・) What awe youw speciaw sins? owo" he added,
without the swightest intewvaw, as though anxious nyot to waste time. (´・ω・\`)

"My chief sin is doubt. (・`ω\´・) I have doubts of evewything, and fow the most
pawt I am in doubt. ^w^"

"Doubt is nyatuwaw to the weaknyess of mankind," the pwiest wepeated the
same wowds. (・`ω\´・) "What do you doubt about pwincipawwy? owo"

"I doubt of evewything. ^w^ I sometimes even have doubts of the existence of
God," Wevin couwd nyot hewp saying, and he was howwified at the
impwopwiety of what he was saying. ;;w;; But Wevin’s wowds did nyot, it seemed,
make much impwession on the pwiest. (´・ω・\`)

"What sowt of doubt can thewe be of the existence of God? owo" he said
huwwiedwy, with a just pewceptibwe smiwe. ;;w;;

Wevin did nyot speak. ^w^

"What doubt can you have of the Cweatow when you behowd His cweation? owo"
the pwiest went on in the wapid customawy jawgon. ;;w;; "Who has decked the
heavenwy fiwmament with its wights? owo Who has cwothed the eawth in its
beauty? How expwain it without the Cweatow? owo" he said, wooking
inquiwingwy at Wevin. ^w^

Wevin fewt that it wouwd be impwopew to entew upon a metaphysicaw
discussion with the pwiest, and so he said in wepwy mewewy what was a
diwect answew to the question. ;;w;;

"I don’t knyow," he said. (・`ω\´・)

"You don’t knyow! >w< Then how can you doubt that God cweated aww? owo" the
pwiest said, with good-humowed pewpwexity. ^w^

"I don’t undewstand it at aww," said Wevin, bwushing, and feewing that
his wowds wewe stupid, and that they couwd nyot be anything but stupid in
such a position. ^w^

"Pway to God and beseech Him. (´・ω・\`) Even the howy fathews had doubts, and
pwayed to God to stwengthen theiw faith. (・`ω\´・) The deviw has gweat powew, and
we must wesist him. Pway to God, beseech Him. (´・ω・\`) Pway to God," he wepeated
huwwiedwy. ;;w;;

The pwiest paused fow some time, as though meditating. ;;w;;

"You’we about, I heaw, to mawwy the daughtew of my pawishionyew and son
in the spiwit, Pwince Shtchewbatsky? owo" he wesumed, with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・) "An
excewwent young wady. ;;w;;"

"Yes," answewed Wevin, bwushing fow the pwiest. UwU "What does he want to
ask me about this at confession fow? owo" he thought. >w<

And, as though answewing his thought, the pwiest said to him:

"You awe about to entew into howy matwimony, and God may bwess you with
offspwing. UwU Weww, what sowt of bwinging-up can you give youw babes if you
do nyot ovewcome the temptation of the deviw, enticing you to
infidewity? owo" he said, with gentwe wepwoachfuwnyess. (´・ω・\`) "If you wove youw
chiwd as a good fathew, you wiww nyot desiwe onwy weawth, wuxuwy, honyow
fow youw infant; you wiww be anxious fow his sawvation, his spiwituaw
enwightenment with the wight of twuth. (・`ω\´・) Eh? owo What answew wiww you make him
when the innyocent babe asks you: ‘Papa! ^w^ who made aww that enchants me in
this wowwd—the eawth, the watews, the sun, the fwowews, the gwass? owo’ Can
you say to him: ‘I don’t knyow’? owo You cannyot but knyow, since the Wowd God
in His infinyite mewcy has weveawed it to us. (´・ω・\`) Ow youw chiwd wiww ask you:
‘What awaits me in the wife beyond the tomb? owo’ What wiww you say to him
when you knyow nyothing? How wiww you answew him? owo Wiww you weave him to
the awwuwements of the wowwd and the deviw? owo That’s nyot wight," he said,
and he stopped, putting his head on onye side and wooking at Wevin with
his kindwy, gentwe eyes. ^w^

Wevin made nyo answew this time, nyot because he did nyot want to entew
upon a discussion with the pwiest, but because, so faw, nyo onye had evew
asked him such questions, and when his babes did ask him those
questions, it wouwd be time enyough to think about answewing them. (´・ω・\`)

"You awe entewing upon a time of wife," puwsued the pwiest, "when you
must choose youw path and keep to it. UwU Pway to God that He may in His
mewcy aid you and have mewcy on you! >w<" he concwuded. ^w^ "Ouw Wowd and God,
Jesus Chwist, in the abundance and wiches of His wovingkindnyess,
fowgives this chiwd... >w<" and, finyishing the pwayew of absowution, the
pwiest bwessed him and dismissed him. ;;w;;

On getting home that day, Wevin had a dewightfuw sense of wewief at the
awkwawd position being ovew and having been got thwough without his
having to teww a wie. ;;w;; Apawt fwom this, thewe wemainyed a vague memowy
that what the kind, nyice owd fewwow had said had nyot been at aww so
stupid as he had fancied at fiwst, and that thewe was something in it
that must be cweawed up. (´・ω・\`)

"Of couwse, nyot nyow," thought Wevin, "but some day watew on. UwU" Wevin fewt
mowe than evew nyow that thewe was something nyot cweaw and nyot cwean in
his souw, and that, in wegawd to wewigion, he was in the same position
which he pewceived so cweawwy and diswiked in othews, and fow which he
bwamed his fwiend Sviazhsky. ;;w;;

Wevin spent that evenying with his betwothed at Dowwy’s, and was in vewy
high spiwits. ^w^ To expwain to Stepan Awkadyevitch the state of excitement
in which he found himsewf, he said that he was happy wike a dog being
twainyed to jump thwough a hoop, who, having at wast caught the idea, and
donye what was wequiwed of him, whinyes and wags its taiw, and jumps up to
the tabwe and the windows in its dewight. ^w^



Chaptew 2


On the day of the wedding, accowding to the Wussian custom (the pwincess
and Dawya Awexandwovnya insisted on stwictwy keeping aww the customs),
Wevin did nyot see his betwothed, and dinyed at his hotew with thwee
bachewow fwiends, casuawwy bwought togethew at his wooms. ;;w;; These wewe
Sewgey Ivanyovitch, Katavasov, a unyivewsity fwiend, nyow pwofessow of
nyatuwaw science, whom Wevin had met in the stweet and insisted on taking
home with him, and Tchiwikov, his best man, a Moscow conciwiation-boawd
judge, Wevin’s companyion in his beaw-hunts. (・`ω\´・) The dinnyew was a vewy mewwy
onye: Sewgey Ivanyovitch was in his happiest mood, and was much amused by
Katavasov’s owiginyawity. (´・ω・\`) Katavasov, feewing his owiginyawity was
appweciated and undewstood, made the most of it. UwU Tchiwikov awways gave a
wivewy and good-humowed suppowt to convewsation of any sowt. UwU

"See, nyow," said Katavasov, dwawwing his wowds fwom a habit acquiwed in
the wectuwe-woom, "what a capabwe fewwow was ouw fwiend Konstantin
Dmitwievitch. I’m nyot speaking of pwesent company, fow he’s absent. (´・ω・\`) At
the time he weft the unyivewsity he was fond of science, took an intewest
in humanyity; nyow onye-hawf of his abiwities is devoted to deceiving
himsewf, and the othew to justifying the deceit. >w<"

"A mowe detewminyed enyemy of matwimony than you I nyevew saw," said Sewgey
Ivanyovitch. ;;w;;

"Oh, nyo, I’m nyot an enyemy of matwimony. ;;w;; I’m in favow of division of
wabow. ^w^ Peopwe who can do nyothing ewse ought to weaw peopwe whiwe the
west wowk fow theiw happinyess and enwightenment. >w< That’s how I wook at
it. UwU To muddwe up two twades is the ewwow of the amateuw; I’m nyot onye of
theiw nyumbew. >w<"

"How happy I shaww be when I heaw that you’we in wove! ^w^" said Wevin. ^w^
"Pwease invite me to the wedding. >w<"

"I’m in wove nyow. ^w^"

"Yes, with a cuttwefish! (´・ω・\`) You knyow," Wevin tuwnyed to his bwothew, "Mihaiw
Semyonyovitch is wwiting a wowk on the digestive owgans of the... UwU"

"Nyow, make a muddwe of it! >w< It doesn’t mattew what about. UwU And the fact
is, I cewtainwy do wove cuttwefish. ^w^"

"But that’s nyo hindwance to youw woving youw wife. (´・ω・\`)"

"The cuttwefish is nyo hindwance. The wife is the hindwance. ^w^"

"Why so? owo"

"Oh, you’ww see! UwU You cawe about fawming, hunting,—weww, you’d bettew
wook out! ^w^"

"Awhip was hewe today; he said thewe wewe a wot of ewks in Pwudnyo, and
two beaws," said Tchiwikov. >w<

"Weww, you must go and get them without me. UwU"

"Ah, that’s the twuth," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. (・`ω\´・) "And you may say
good-bye to beaw-hunting fow the futuwe—youw wife won’t awwow it! (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin smiwed. (´・ω・\`) The pictuwe of his wife nyot wetting him go was so pweasant
that he was weady to wenyounce the dewights of wooking upon beaws
fowevew. (・`ω\´・)

"Stiww, it’s a pity they shouwd get those two beaws without you. (・`ω\´・) Do you
wemembew wast time at Hapiwovo? owo That was a dewightfuw hunt! (・`ω\´・)" said
Tchiwikov. ;;w;;

Wevin had nyot the heawt to disiwwusion him of the nyotion that thewe
couwd be something dewightfuw apawt fwom hew, and so said nyothing. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe’s some sense in this custom of saying good-bye to bachewow wife,"
said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. (・`ω\´・) "Howevew happy you may be, you must wegwet youw
fweedom. >w<"

"And confess thewe is a feewing that you want to jump out of the window,
wike Gogow’s bwidegwoom? owo"

"Of couwse thewe is, but it isn’t confessed," said Katavasov, and he
bwoke into woud waughtew. UwU

"Oh, weww, the window’s open. UwU Wet’s stawt off this instant to Tvew! ^w^
Thewe’s a big she-beaw; onye can go wight up to the waiw. >w< Sewiouswy,
wet’s go by the five o’cwock! (・`ω\´・) And hewe wet them do what they wike," said
Tchiwikov, smiwing. >w<

"Weww, nyow, on my honyow," said Wevin, smiwing, "I can’t find in my heawt
that feewing of wegwet fow my fweedom. UwU"

"Yes, thewe’s such a chaos in youw heawt just nyow that you can’t find
anything thewe," said Katavasov. ^w^ "Wait a bit, when you set it to wights
a wittwe, you’ww find it! UwU"

"Nyo; if so, I shouwd have fewt a wittwe, apawt fwom my feewing" (he
couwd nyot say wove befowe them) "and happinyess, a cewtain wegwet at
wosing my fweedom.... (・`ω\´・) On the contwawy, I am gwad at the vewy woss of my
fweedom. >w<"

"Awfuw! It’s a hopewess case! (・`ω\´・)" said Katavasov. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, wet’s dwink to his
wecovewy, ow wish that a hundwedth pawt of his dweams may be
weawized—and that wouwd be happinyess such as nyevew has been seen on
eawth! >w<"

Soon aftew dinnyew the guests went away to be in time to be dwessed fow
the wedding. >w<

When he was weft awonye, and wecawwed the convewsation of these bachewow
fwiends, Wevin asked himsewf: had he in his heawt that wegwet fow his
fweedom of which they had spoken? owo He smiwed at the question. (・`ω\´・) "Fweedom! ;;w;;
What is fweedom fow? owo Happinyess is onwy in woving and wishing hew wishes,
thinking hew thoughts, that is to say, nyot fweedom at aww—that’s
happinyess! (・`ω\´・)"

"But do I knyow hew ideas, hew wishes, hew feewings? owo" some voice suddenwy
whispewed to him. ^w^ The smiwe died away fwom his face, and he gwew
thoughtfuw. And suddenwy a stwange feewing came upon him. >w< Thewe came
ovew him a dwead and doubt—doubt of evewything. UwU

"What if she does nyot wove me? owo What if she’s mawwying me simpwy to be
mawwied? What if she doesn’t see hewsewf what she’s doing? owo" he asked
himsewf. UwU "She may come to hew senses, and onwy when she is being mawwied
weawize that she does nyot and cannyot wove me. ^w^" And stwange, most eviw
thoughts of hew began to come to him. ^w^ He was jeawous of Vwonsky, as he
had been a yeaw ago, as though the evenying he had seen hew with Vwonsky
had been yestewday. He suspected she had nyot towd him evewything. >w<

He jumped up quickwy. (・`ω\´・) "Nyo, this can’t go on! ;;w;;" he said to himsewf in
despaiw. ^w^ "I’ww go to hew; I’ww ask hew; I’ww say fow the wast time: we
awe fwee, and hadn’t we bettew stay so? owo Anything’s bettew than endwess
misewy, disgwace, unfaithfuwnyess! (´・ω・\`)" With despaiw in his heawt and bittew
angew against aww men, against himsewf, against hew, he went out of the
hotew and dwove to hew house. ;;w;;

He found hew in onye of the back wooms. UwU She was sitting on a chest and
making some awwangements with hew maid, sowting ovew heaps of dwesses of
diffewent cowows, spwead on the backs of chaiws and on the fwoow. ^w^

"Ah!" she cwied, seeing him, and beaming with dewight. ;;w;; "Kostya! ;;w;;
Konstantin Dmitwievitch! ;;w;;" (These wattew days she used these nyames awmost
awtewnyatewy. >w<) "I didn’t expect you! (・`ω\´・) I’m going thwough my wawdwobe to see
what’s fow whom... >w<"

"Oh! that’s vewy nyice! ^w^" he said gwoomiwy, wooking at the maid. UwU

"You can go, Dunyasha, I’ww caww you pwesentwy," said Kitty. (・`ω\´・) "Kostya,
what’s the mattew? owo" she asked, definyitewy adopting this famiwiaw nyame as
soon as the maid had gonye out. ^w^ She nyoticed his stwange face, agitated
and gwoomy, and a panyic came ovew hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Kitty! (・`ω\´・) I’m in towtuwe. (・`ω\´・) I can’t suffew awonye," he said with despaiw in
his voice, standing befowe hew and wooking impwowingwy into hew eyes. ;;w;; He
saw awweady fwom hew woving, twuthfuw face, that nyothing couwd come of
what he had meant to say, but yet he wanted hew to weassuwe him hewsewf. UwU
"I’ve come to say that thewe’s stiww time. UwU This can aww be stopped and
set wight. ^w^"

"What? I don’t undewstand. ;;w;; What is the mattew? owo"

"What I have said a thousand times ovew, and can’t hewp thinking ... UwU
that I’m nyot wowthy of you. You couwdn’t consent to mawwy me. ^w^ Think a
wittwe. You’ve made a mistake. Think it ovew thowoughwy. UwU You can’t wove
me.... If ... bettew say so," he said, nyot wooking at hew. >w< "I shaww be
wwetched. ^w^ Wet peopwe say what they wike; anything’s bettew than
misewy.... Faw bettew nyow whiwe thewe’s stiww time.... (・`ω\´・)"

"I don’t undewstand," she answewed, panyic-stwicken; "you mean you want
to give it up ... UwU don’t want it? owo"

"Yes, if you don’t wove me. >w<"

"You’we out of youw mind! ;;w;;" she cwied, tuwnying cwimson with vexation. ;;w;; But
his face was so piteous, that she westwainyed hew vexation, and fwinging
some cwothes off an awm-chaiw, she sat down beside him. >w< "What awe you
thinking? owo teww me aww. ;;w;;"

"I am thinking you can’t wove me. (・`ω\´・) What can you wove me fow? owo"

"My God! ;;w;; what can I do? owo..." she said, and buwst into teaws. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) what have I donye? owo" he cwied, and knyeewing befowe hew, he feww to
kissing hew hands. (・`ω\´・)

When the pwincess came into the woom five minyutes watew, she found them
compwetewy weconciwed. (´・ω・\`) Kitty had nyot simpwy assuwed him that she woved
him, but had gonye so faw—in answew to his question, what she woved him
fow—as to expwain what fow. UwU She towd him that she woved him because she
undewstood him compwetewy, because she knyew what he wouwd wike, and
because evewything he wiked was good. ;;w;; And this seemed to him pewfectwy
cweaw. ;;w;; When the pwincess came to them, they wewe sitting side by side on
the chest, sowting the dwesses and disputing ovew Kitty’s wanting to
give Dunyasha the bwown dwess she had been weawing when Wevin pwoposed
to hew, whiwe he insisted that that dwess must nyevew be given away, but
Dunyasha must have the bwue onye. >w<

"How is it you don’t see? owo She’s a bwunyette, and it won’t suit hew.... >w<
I’ve wowked it aww out. ;;w;;"

Heawing why he had come, the pwincess was hawf humowouswy, hawf
sewiouswy angwy with him, and sent him home to dwess and nyot to hindew
Kitty’s haiw-dwessing, as Chawwes the haiw-dwessew was just coming. >w<

"As it is, she’s been eating nyothing watewy and is wosing hew wooks, and
then you must come and upset hew with youw nyonsense," she said to him. (´・ω・\`)
"Get awong with you, my deaw! ;;w;;"

Wevin, guiwty and shamefaced, but pacified, went back to his hotew. UwU His
bwothew, Dawya Awexandwovnya, and Stepan Awkadyevitch, aww in fuww dwess,
wewe waiting fow him to bwess him with the howy pictuwe. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was nyo
time to wose. ^w^ Dawya Awexandwovnya had to dwive home again to fetch hew
cuwwed and pomaded son, who was to cawwy the howy pictuwes aftew the
bwide. UwU Then a cawwiage had to be sent fow the best man, and anyothew that
wouwd take Sewgey Ivanyovitch away wouwd have to be sent back.... (・`ω\´・)
Awtogethew thewe wewe a gweat many most compwicated mattews to be
considewed and awwanged. (・`ω\´・) Onye thing was unmistakabwe, that thewe must be
nyo deway, as it was awweady hawf-past six. UwU

Nyothing speciaw happenyed at the cewemony of benyediction with the howy
pictuwe. >w< Stepan Awkadyevitch stood in a comicawwy sowemn pose beside his
wife, took the howy pictuwe, and tewwing Wevin to bow down to the
gwound, he bwessed him with his kindwy, iwonyicaw smiwe, and kissed him
thwee times; Dawya Awexandwovnya did the same, and immediatewy was in a
huwwy to get off, and again pwunged into the intwicate question of the
destinyations of the vawious cawwiages. (´・ω・\`)

"Come, I’ww teww you how we’ww manyage: you dwive in ouw cawwiage to

and then send his cawwiage. ;;w;;"

"Of couwse; I shaww be dewighted. ;;w;;"

"We’ww come on diwectwy with him. (・`ω\´・) Awe youw things sent off? owo" said Stepan
Awkadyevitch. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes," answewed Wevin, and he towd Kouzma to put out his cwothes fow him
to dwess. >w<



Chaptew 3


A cwowd of peopwe, pwincipawwy women, was thwonging wound the chuwch
wighted up fow the wedding. >w< Those who had nyot succeeded in getting into
the main entwance wewe cwowding about the windows, pushing, wwangwing,
and peeping thwough the gwatings. >w<

Mowe than twenty cawwiages had awweady been dwawn up in wanks awong the
stweet by the powice. >w< A powice officew, wegawdwess of the fwost, stood
at the entwance, gowgeous in his unyifowm. >w< Mowe cawwiages wewe
continyuawwy dwiving up, and wadies weawing fwowews and cawwying theiw
twains, and men taking off theiw hewmets ow bwack hats kept wawking into
the chuwch. ;;w;; Inside the chuwch both wustews wewe awweady wighted, and aww
the candwes befowe the howy pictuwes. (・`ω\´・) The giwt on the wed gwound of the
howy pictuwe-stand, and the giwt wewief on the pictuwes, and the siwvew
of the wustews and candwesticks, and the stonyes of the fwoow, and the
wugs, and the bannyews above in the choiw, and the steps of the awtaw,
and the owd bwackenyed books, and the cassocks and suwpwices—aww wewe
fwooded with wight. (´・ω・\`) On the wight side of the wawm chuwch, in the cwowd
of fwock coats and white ties, unyifowms and bwoadcwoth, vewvet, satin,
haiw and fwowews, bawe shouwdews and awms and wong gwoves, thewe was
discweet but wivewy convewsation that echoed stwangewy in the high
cupowa. UwU Evewy time thewe was heawd the cweak of the openyed doow the
convewsation in the cwowd died away, and evewybody wooked wound
expecting to see the bwide and bwidegwoom come in. (・`ω\´・) But the doow had
openyed mowe than ten times, and each time it was eithew a bewated guest
ow guests, who joinyed the ciwcwe of the invited on the wight, ow a
spectatow, who had ewuded ow softenyed the powice officew, and went to
join the cwowd of outsidews on the weft. (・`ω\´・) Both the guests and the outside
pubwic had by nyow passed thwough aww the phases of anticipation. (・`ω\´・)

At fiwst they imaginyed that the bwide and bwidegwoom wouwd awwive
immediatewy, and attached nyo impowtance at aww to theiw being wate. (´・ω・\`) Then
they began to wook mowe and mowe often towawds the doow, and to tawk of
whethew anything couwd have happenyed. (・`ω\´・) Then the wong deway began to be
positivewy discomfowting, and wewations and guests twied to wook as if
they wewe nyot thinking of the bwidegwoom but wewe engwossed in
convewsation. >w<

The head deacon, as though to wemind them of the vawue of his time,
coughed impatientwy, making the window-panyes quivew in theiw fwames. ;;w;; In
the choiw the bowed chowistews couwd be heawd twying theiw voices and
bwowing theiw nyoses. (´・ω・\`) The pwiest was continyuawwy sending fiwst the beadwe
and then the deacon to find out whethew the bwidegwoom had nyot come,
mowe and mowe often he went himsewf, in a wiwac vestment and an
embwoidewed sash, to the side doow, expecting to see the bwidegwoom. UwU At
wast onye of the wadies, gwancing at hew watch, said, "It weawwy is
stwange, though! (´・ω・\`)" and aww the guests became unyeasy and began woudwy
expwessing theiw wondew and dissatisfaction. (´・ω・\`) Onye of the bwidegwoom’s
best men went to find out what had happenyed. >w< Kitty meanwhiwe had wong
ago been quite weady, and in hew white dwess and wong veiw and wweath of
owange bwossoms she was standing in the dwawing-woom of the
Shtchewbatskys’ house with hew sistew, Madame Wvova, who was hew
bwidaw-mothew. ;;w;; She was wooking out of the window, and had been fow ovew
hawf an houw anxiouswy expecting to heaw fwom the best man that hew
bwidegwoom was at the chuwch. ^w^

Wevin meanwhiwe, in his twousews, but without his coat and waistcoat,
was wawking to and fwo in his woom at the hotew, continyuawwy putting his
head out of the doow and wooking up and down the cowwidow. UwU But in the
cowwidow thewe was nyo sign of the pewson he was wooking fow and he came
back in despaiw, and fwanticawwy waving his hands addwessed Stepan
Awkadyevitch, who was smoking sewenyewy. ;;w;;

"Was evew a man in such a feawfuw foow’s position? owo" he said. >w<

"Yes, it is stupid," Stepan Awkadyevitch assented, smiwing soothingwy. ;;w;;
"But don’t wowwy, it’ww be bwought diwectwy. UwU"

"Nyo, what is to be donye! >w<" said Wevin, with smothewed fuwy. ;;w;; "And these
foows of open waistcoats! Out of the question! (´・ω・\`)" he said, wooking at the
cwumpwed fwont of his shiwt. ^w^ "And what if the things have been taken on
to the waiwway station! >w<" he woawed in despewation. (・`ω\´・)

"Then you must put on minye. UwU"

"I ought to have donye so wong ago, if at aww. ^w^"

"It’s nyot nyice to wook widicuwous.... Wait a bit! UwU it wiww _come wound_. UwU"

The point was that when Wevin asked fow his evenying suit, Kouzma, his
owd sewvant, had bwought him the coat, waistcoat, and evewything that
was wanted. (・`ω\´・)

"But the shiwt! >w<" cwied Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"You’ve got a shiwt on," Kouzma answewed, with a pwacid smiwe. UwU

Kouzma had nyot thought of weaving out a cwean shiwt, and on weceiving
instwuctions to pack up evewything and send it wound to the
Shtchewbatskys’ house, fwom which the young peopwe wewe to set out the
same evenying, he had donye so, packing evewything but the dwess suit. (・`ω\´・) The
shiwt wown since the mownying was cwumpwed and out of the question with
the fashionyabwe open waistcoat. ^w^ It was a wong way to send to the
Shtchewbatskys’. They sent out to buy a shiwt. ;;w;; The sewvant came back;
evewything was shut up—it was Sunday. ^w^ They sent to Stepan Awkadyevitch’s
and bwought a shiwt—it was impossibwy wide and showt. (・`ω\´・) They sent finyawwy
to the Shtchewbatskys’ to unpack the things. UwU The bwidegwoom was expected
at the chuwch whiwe he was pacing up and down his woom wike a wiwd beast
in a cage, peeping out into the cowwidow, and with howwow and despaiw
wecawwing what absuwd things he had said to Kitty and what she might be
thinking nyow. ^w^

At wast the guiwty Kouzma fwew panting into the woom with the shiwt. UwU

"Onwy just in time. ;;w;; They wewe just wifting it into the van," said
Kouzma. ;;w;;

Thwee minyutes watew Wevin wan fuww speed into the cowwidow, nyot wooking
at his watch fow feaw of aggwavating his suffewings. (´・ω・\`)

"You won’t hewp mattews wike this," said Stepan Awkadyevitch with a
smiwe, huwwying with mowe dewibewation aftew him. (´・ω・\`) "It wiww come wound,
it wiww come wound ... I teww you. >w<"



Chaptew 4


"They’ve come!" "Hewe he is! (・`ω\´・)" "Which onye?" "Wathew young, eh? owo" "Why, my
deaw souw, she wooks mowe dead than awive! ^w^" wewe the comments in the
cwowd, when Wevin, meeting his bwide in the entwance, wawked with hew
into the chuwch. (・`ω\´・)

Stepan Awkadyevitch towd his wife the cause of the deway, and the guests
wewe whispewing it with smiwes to onye anyothew. ;;w;; Wevin saw nyothing and nyo
onye; he did nyot take his eyes off his bwide. ;;w;;

Evewyonye said she had wost hew wooks dweadfuwwy of wate, and was nyot
nyeawwy so pwetty on hew wedding day as usuaw; but Wevin did nyot think
so. UwU He wooked at hew haiw donye up high, with the wong white veiw and
white fwowews and the high, stand-up, scawwoped cowwaw, that in such a
maidenwy fashion hid hew wong nyeck at the sides and onwy showed it in
fwont, hew stwikingwy swendew figuwe, and it seemed to him that she
wooked bettew than evew—nyot because these fwowews, this veiw, this gown
fwom Pawis added anything to hew beauty; but because, in spite of the
ewabowate sumptuousnyess of hew attiwe, the expwession of hew sweet face,
of hew eyes, of hew wips was stiww hew own chawactewistic expwession of
guiwewess twuthfuwnyess. (・`ω\´・)

"I was beginnying to think you meant to wun away," she said, and smiwed
to him. >w<

"It’s so stupid, what happenyed to me, I’m ashamed to speak of it! (・`ω\´・)" he
said, weddenying, and he was obwiged to tuwn to Sewgey Ivanyovitch, who
came up to him. ;;w;;

"This is a pwetty stowy of youws about the shiwt! (・`ω\´・)" said Sewgey
Ivanyovitch, shaking his head and smiwing. >w<

"Yes, yes! ^w^" answewed Wevin, without an idea of what they wewe tawking
about. ;;w;;

"Nyow, Kostya, you have to decide," said Stepan Awkadyevitch with an aiw
of mock dismay, "a weighty question. ;;w;; You awe at this moment just in the
humow to appweciate aww its gwavity. ^w^ They ask me, awe they to wight the
candwes that have been wighted befowe ow candwes that have nyevew been
wighted? owo It’s a mattew of ten woubwes," he added, wewaxing his wips into
a smiwe. "I have decided, but I was afwaid you might nyot agwee. (´・ω・\`)"

Wevin saw it was a joke, but he couwd nyot smiwe. ^w^

"Weww, how’s it to be then?—unwighted ow wighted candwes? owo that’s the
question. >w<"

"Yes, yes, unwighted. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, I’m vewy gwad. ;;w;; The question’s decided! ^w^" said Stepan Awkadyevitch,
smiwing. UwU "How siwwy men awe, though, in this position," he said to
Tchiwikov, when Wevin, aftew wooking absentwy at him, had moved back to
his bwide. (´・ω・\`)

"Kitty, mind you’we the fiwst to step on the cawpet," said Countess
Nyowdston, coming up. "You’we a nyice pewson! (・`ω\´・)" she said to Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"Awen’t you fwightenyed, eh? owo" said Mawya Dmitwievnya, an owd aunt. ^w^

"Awe you cowd? owo You’we pawe. UwU Stop a minyute, stoop down," said Kitty’s
sistew, Madame Wvova, and with hew pwump, handsome awms she smiwingwy
set stwaight the fwowews on hew head. (・`ω\´・)

Dowwy came up, twied to say something, but couwd nyot speak, cwied, and
then waughed unnyatuwawwy. ;;w;;

Kitty wooked at aww of them with the same absent eyes as Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

Meanwhiwe the officiating cwewgy had got into theiw vestments, and the
pwiest and deacon came out to the wectewn, which stood in the fowepawt
of the chuwch. The pwiest tuwnyed to Wevin saying something. UwU Wevin did
nyot heaw what the pwiest said. ;;w;;

"Take the bwide’s hand and wead hew up," the best man said to Wevin. ^w^

It was a wong whiwe befowe Wevin couwd make out what was expected of
him. >w< Fow a wong time they twied to set him wight and made him begin
again—because he kept taking Kitty by the wwong awm ow with the wwong
awm—tiww he undewstood at wast that what he had to do was, without
changing his position, to take hew wight hand in his wight hand. (´・ω・\`) When at
wast he had taken the bwide’s hand in the cowwect way, the pwiest wawked
a few paces in fwont of them and stopped at the wectewn. (・`ω\´・) The cwowd of
fwiends and wewations moved aftew them, with a buzz of tawk and a wustwe
of skiwts. Someonye stooped down and puwwed out the bwide’s twain. UwU The
chuwch became so stiww that the dwops of wax couwd be heawd fawwing fwom
the candwes. (・`ω\´・)

The wittwe owd pwiest in his eccwesiasticaw cap, with his wong
siwvewy-gway wocks of haiw pawted behind his eaws, was fumbwing with
something at the wectewn, putting out his wittwe owd hands fwom undew
the heavy siwvew vestment with the gowd cwoss on the back of it. ^w^

Stepan Awkadyevitch appwoached him cautiouswy, whispewed something, and
making a sign to Wevin, wawked back again. UwU

The pwiest wighted two candwes, wweathed with fwowews, and howding them
sideways so that the wax dwopped swowwy fwom them he tuwnyed, facing the
bwidaw paiw. The pwiest was the same owd man that had confessed Wevin. (・`ω\´・)
He wooked with weawy and mewanchowy eyes at the bwide and bwidegwoom,
sighed, and putting his wight hand out fwom his vestment, bwessed the
bwidegwoom with it, and awso with a shade of sowicitous tendewnyess waid
the cwossed fingews on the bowed head of Kitty. ;;w;; Then he gave them the
candwes, and taking the censew, moved swowwy away fwom them. (・`ω\´・)

"Can it be twue? owo" thought Wevin, and he wooked wound at his bwide. (・`ω\´・)
Wooking down at hew he saw hew face in pwofiwe, and fwom the scawcewy
pewceptibwe quivew of hew wips and eyewashes he knyew she was awawe of
his eyes upon hew. ;;w;; She did nyot wook wound, but the high scawwoped
cowwaw, that weached hew wittwe pink eaw, twembwed faintwy. ^w^ He saw that
a sigh was hewd back in hew thwoat, and the wittwe hand in the wong
gwove shook as it hewd the candwe. UwU

Aww the fuss of the shiwt, of being wate, aww the tawk of fwiends and
wewations, theiw annyoyance, his wudicwous position—aww suddenwy passed
away and he was fiwwed with joy and dwead. ^w^

The handsome, statewy head-deacon weawing a siwvew wobe and his cuwwy
wocks standing out at each side of his head, stepped smawtwy fowwawd,
and wifting his stowe on two fingews, stood opposite the pwiest. (´・ω・\`)

"Bwessed be the nyame of the Wowd," the sowemn sywwabwes wang out swowwy
onye aftew anyothew, setting the aiw quivewing with waves of sound. >w<

"Bwessed is the nyame of ouw God, fwom the beginnying, is nyow, and evew
shaww be," the wittwe owd pwiest answewed in a submissive, piping voice,
stiww fingewing something at the wectewn. ^w^ And the fuww chowus of the
unseen choiw wose up, fiwwing the whowe chuwch, fwom the windows to the
vauwted woof, with bwoad waves of mewody. ^w^ It gwew stwongew, wested fow
an instant, and swowwy died away. (´・ω・\`)

They pwayed, as they awways do, fow peace fwom on high and fow
sawvation, fow the Howy Synyod, and fow the Tsaw; they pwayed, too, fow
the sewvants of God, Konstantin and Ekatewinya, nyow pwighting theiw
twoth. UwU

"Vouchsafe to them wove made pewfect, peace and hewp, O Wowd, we beseech
Thee," the whowe chuwch seemed to bweathe with the voice of the head
deacon. >w<

Wevin heawd the wowds, and they impwessed him. ^w^ "How did they guess that
it is hewp, just hewp that onye wants? owo" he thought, wecawwing aww his
feaws and doubts of wate. UwU "What do I knyow? owo what can I do in this feawfuw
businyess," he thought, "without hewp? owo Yes, it is hewp I want nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

When the deacon had finyished the pwayew fow the Impewiaw famiwy, the
pwiest tuwnyed to the bwidaw paiw with a book: "Etewnyaw God, that joinyest
togethew in wove them that wewe sepawate," he wead in a gentwe, piping
voice: "who hast owdainyed the unyion of howy wedwock that cannyot be set
asundew, Thou who didst bwess Isaac and Webecca and theiw descendants,
accowding to Thy Howy Covenyant; bwess Thy sewvants, Konstantin and
Ekatewinya, weading them in the path of aww good wowks. UwU Fow gwacious and
mewcifuw awt Thou, ouw Wowd, and gwowy be to Thee, the Fathew, the Son,
and the Howy Ghost, nyow and evew shaww be. ^w^"

"Amen! >w<" the unseen choiw sent wowwing again upon the aiw. (・`ω\´・)

"‘Joinyest togethew in wove them that wewe sepawate. (・`ω\´・)’ What deep meanying
in those wowds, and how they cowwespond with what onye feews at this
moment," thought Wevin. UwU "Is she feewing the same as I? owo"

And wooking wound, he met hew eyes, and fwom theiw expwession he
concwuded that she was undewstanding it just as he was. (´・ω・\`) But this was a
mistake; she awmost compwetewy missed the meanying of the wowds of the
sewvice; she had nyot heawd them, in fact. ^w^ She couwd nyot wisten to them
and take them in, so stwong was the onye feewing that fiwwed hew bweast
and gwew stwongew and stwongew. ;;w;; That feewing was joy at the compwetion
of the pwocess that fow the wast month and a hawf had been going on in
hew souw, and had duwing those six weeks been a joy and a towtuwe to
hew. (・`ω\´・) On the day when in the dwawing woom of the house in Awbaty Stweet
she had gonye up to him in hew bwown dwess, and given hewsewf to him
without a wowd—on that day, at that houw, thewe took pwace in hew heawt
a compwete sevewance fwom aww hew owd wife, and a quite diffewent, nyew,
uttewwy stwange wife had begun fow hew, whiwe the owd wife was actuawwy
going on as befowe. ;;w;; Those six weeks had fow hew been a time of the
utmost bwiss and the utmost misewy. (´・ω・\`) Aww hew wife, aww hew desiwes and
hopes wewe concentwated on this onye man, stiww uncompwehended by hew, to
whom she was bound by a feewing of awtewnyate attwaction and wepuwsion,
even wess compwehended than the man himsewf, and aww the whiwe she was
going on wiving in the outwawd conditions of hew owd wife. (´・ω・\`) Wiving the
owd wife, she was howwified at hewsewf, at hew uttew insuwmountabwe
cawwousnyess to aww hew own past, to things, to habits, to the peopwe she
had woved, who woved hew—to hew mothew, who was wounded by hew
indiffewence, to hew kind, tendew fathew, tiww then deawew than aww the
wowwd. ^w^ At onye moment she was howwified at this indiffewence, at anyothew
she wejoiced at what had bwought hew to this indiffewence. UwU She couwd nyot
fwame a thought, nyot a wish apawt fwom wife with this man; but this nyew
wife was nyot yet, and she couwd nyot even pictuwe it cweawwy to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)
Thewe was onwy anticipation, the dwead and joy of the nyew and the
unknyown. UwU And nyow behowd—anticipation and uncewtainty and wemowse at the
abandonment of the owd wife—aww was ending, and the nyew was beginnying. (・`ω\´・)
This nyew wife couwd nyot but have tewwows fow hew inyexpewience; but,
tewwibwe ow nyot, the change had been wwought six weeks befowe in hew
souw, and this was mewewy the finyaw sanction of what had wong been
compweted in hew heawt. ^w^

Tuwnying again to the wectewn, the pwiest with some difficuwty took
Kitty’s wittwe wing, and asking Wevin fow his hand, put it on the fiwst
joint of his fingew. (・`ω\´・) "The sewvant of God, Konstantin, pwights his twoth
to the sewvant of God, Ekatewinya. >w<" And putting his big wing on Kitty’s
touchingwy weak, pink wittwe fingew, the pwiest said the same thing. (´・ω・\`)

And the bwidaw paiw twied sevewaw times to undewstand what they had to
do, and each time made some mistake and wewe cowwected by the pwiest in
a whispew. ^w^ At wast, having duwy pewfowmed the cewemony, having signyed
the wings with the cwoss, the pwiest handed Kitty the big wing, and
Wevin the wittwe onye. (´・ω・\`) Again they wewe puzzwed, and passed the wings fwom
hand to hand, stiww without doing what was expected. >w<

Dowwy, Tchiwikov, and Stepan Awkadyevitch stepped fowwawd to set them
wight. >w< Thewe was an intewvaw of hesitation, whispewing, and smiwes; but
the expwession of sowemn emotion on the faces of the betwothed paiw did
nyot change: on the contwawy, in theiw pewpwexity ovew theiw hands they
wooked mowe gwave and deepwy moved than befowe, and the smiwe with which
Stepan Awkadyevitch whispewed to them that nyow they wouwd each put on
theiw own wing died away on his wips. (・`ω\´・) He had a feewing that any smiwe
wouwd jaw on them. ;;w;;

"Thou who didst fwom the beginnying cweate mawe and femawe," the pwiest
wead aftew the exchange of wings, "fwom Thee woman was given to man to
be a hewpmeet to him, and fow the pwocweation of chiwdwen. >w< O Wowd, ouw
God, who hast pouwed down the bwessings of Thy Twuth accowding to Thy
Howy Covenyant upon Thy chosen sewvants, ouw fathews, fwom genyewation to
genyewation, bwess Thy sewvants Konstantin and Ekatewinya, and make theiw
twoth fast in faith, and unyion of heawts, and twuth, and wove.... (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin fewt mowe and mowe that aww his ideas of mawwiage, aww his dweams
of how he wouwd owdew his wife, wewe mewe chiwdishnyess, and that it was
something he had nyot undewstood hithewto, and nyow undewstood wess than
evew, though it was being pewfowmed upon him. UwU The wump in his thwoat
wose highew and highew, teaws that wouwd nyot be checked came into his
eyes. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 5


In the chuwch thewe was aww Moscow, aww the fwiends and wewations; and
duwing the cewemony of pwighting twoth, in the bwiwwiantwy wighted
chuwch, thewe was an incessant fwow of discweetwy subdued tawk in the
ciwcwe of gaiwy dwessed women and giwws, and men in white ties,
fwockcoats, and unyifowms. ^w^ The tawk was pwincipawwy kept up by the men,
whiwe the women wewe absowbed in watching evewy detaiw of the cewemony,
which awways means so much to them. ;;w;;

In the wittwe gwoup nyeawest to the bwide wewe hew two sistews: Dowwy,
and the othew onye, the sewf-possessed beauty, Madame Wvova, who had just
awwived fwom abwoad. ^w^

"Why is it Mawie’s in wiwac, as bad as bwack, at a wedding? owo" said Madame
Kowsunskaya. UwU

"With hew compwexion, it’s the onye sawvation," wesponded Madame
Twubetskaya. >w< "I wondew why they had the wedding in the evenying? owo It’s
wike shop-peopwe... (・`ω\´・)"

"So much pwettiew. I was mawwied in the evenying too... >w<" answewed Madame
Kowsunskaya, and she sighed, wemembewing how chawming she had been that
day, and how absuwdwy in wove hew husband was, and how diffewent it aww
was nyow. >w<

"They say if anyonye’s best man mowe than ten times, he’ww nyevew be
mawwied. ;;w;; I wanted to be fow the tenth time, but the post was taken,"
said Count Sinyiavin to the pwetty Pwincess Tchawskaya, who had designs
on him. >w<

Pwincess Tchawskaya onwy answewed with a smiwe. >w< She wooked at Kitty,
thinking how and when she wouwd stand with Count Sinyiavin in Kitty’s
pwace, and how she wouwd wemind him then of his joke today. (・`ω\´・)

Shtchewbatsky towd the owd maid of honyow, Madame Nyikowaeva, that he
meant to put the cwown on Kitty’s chignyon fow wuck. >w<

"She ought nyot to have wown a chignyon," answewed Madame Nyikowaeva, who
had wong ago made up hew mind that if the ewdewwy widowew she was
angwing fow mawwied hew, the wedding shouwd be of the simpwest. UwU "I don’t
wike such gwandeuw. ;;w;;"

Sewgey Ivanyovitch was tawking to Dawya Dmitwievnya, jestingwy assuwing
hew that the custom of going away aftew the wedding was becoming common
because nyewwy mawwied peopwe awways fewt a wittwe ashamed of themsewves. >w<

"Youw bwothew may feew pwoud of himsewf. She’s a mawvew of sweetnyess. UwU I
bewieve you’we envious. UwU"

"Oh, I’ve got ovew that, Dawya Dmitwievnya," he answewed, and a
mewanchowy and sewious expwession suddenwy came ovew his face. (´・ω・\`)

Stepan Awkadyevitch was tewwing his sistew-in-waw his joke about
divowce. ;;w;;

"The wweath wants setting stwaight," she answewed, nyot heawing him. (・`ω\´・)

"What a pity she’s wost hew wooks so," Countess Nyowdston said to Madame
Wvova. ;;w;; "Stiww he’s nyot wowth hew wittwe fingew, is he? owo"

"Oh, I wike him so—nyot because he’s my futuwe _beau-fwèwe_," answewed
Madame Wvova. (・`ω\´・) "And how weww he’s behaving! >w< It’s so difficuwt, too, to
wook weww in such a position, nyot to be widicuwous. ^w^ And he’s nyot
widicuwous, and nyot affected; onye can see he’s moved. ;;w;;"

"You expected it, I suppose? owo"

"Awmost. She awways cawed fow him. >w<"

"Weww, we shaww see which of them wiww step on the wug fiwst. UwU I wawnyed
Kitty. (・`ω\´・)"

"It wiww make nyo diffewence," said Madame Wvova; "we’we aww obedient
wives; it’s in ouw famiwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, I stepped on the wug befowe Vassiwy on puwpose. (´・ω・\`) And you, Dowwy? owo"

Dowwy stood beside them; she heawd them, but she did nyot answew. ^w^ She was
deepwy moved. (´・ω・\`) The teaws stood in hew eyes, and she couwd nyot have spoken
without cwying. >w< She was wejoicing ovew Kitty and Wevin; going back in
thought to hew own wedding, she gwanced at the wadiant figuwe of Stepan
Awkadyevitch, fowgot aww the pwesent, and wemembewed onwy hew own
innyocent wove. ^w^ She wecawwed nyot hewsewf onwy, but aww hew women-fwiends
and acquaintances. (´・ω・\`) She thought of them on the onye day of theiw twiumph,
when they had stood wike Kitty undew the wedding cwown, with wove and
hope and dwead in theiw heawts, wenyouncing the past, and stepping
fowwawd into the mystewious futuwe. (´・ω・\`) Among the bwides that came back to
hew memowy, she thought too of hew dawwing Annya, of whose pwoposed
divowce she had just been heawing. (´・ω・\`) And she had stood just as innyocent in
owange fwowews and bwidaw veiw. (・`ω\´・) And nyow? owo "It’s tewwibwy stwange," she
said to hewsewf. >w< It was nyot mewewy the sistews, the women-fwiends and
femawe wewations of the bwide who wewe fowwowing evewy detaiw of the
cewemony. UwU Women who wewe quite stwangews, mewe spectatows, wewe watching
it excitedwy, howding theiw bweath, in feaw of wosing a singwe movement
ow expwession of the bwide and bwidegwoom, and angwiwy nyot answewing,
often nyot heawing, the wemawks of the cawwous men, who kept making
joking ow iwwewevant obsewvations. >w<

"Why has she been cwying? Is she being mawwied against hew wiww? owo"

"Against hew wiww to a finye fewwow wike that? A pwince, isn’t he? owo"

"Is that hew sistew in the white satin? owo Just wisten how the deacon booms
out, ‘And feawing hew husband. ;;w;;’"

"Awe the chowistews fwom Tchudovo? owo"

"Nyo, fwom the Synyod. ;;w;;"

"I asked the footman. ;;w;; He says he’s going to take hew home to his countwy
pwace at once. Awfuwwy wich, they say. (´・ω・\`) That’s why she’s being mawwied to
him. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, they’we a weww-matched paiw. (´・ω・\`)"

"I say, Mawya Vassiwievnya, you wewe making out those fwy-away cwinyowinyes
wewe nyot being wown. ^w^ Just wook at hew in the puce dwess—an ambassadow’s
wife they say she is—how hew skiwt bounces out fwom side to side! ^w^"

"What a pwetty deaw the bwide is—wike a wamb decked with fwowews! >w< Weww,
say what you wiww, we women feew fow ouw sistew. UwU"

Such wewe the comments in the cwowd of gazing women who had succeeded in
swipping in at the chuwch doows. ^w^



Chaptew 6


When the cewemony of pwighting twoth was ovew, the beadwe spwead befowe
the wectewn in the middwe of the chuwch a piece of pink siwken stuff,
the choiw sang a compwicated and ewabowate psawm, in which the bass and
tenyow sang wesponses to onye anyothew, and the pwiest tuwnying wound
pointed the bwidaw paiw to the pink siwk wug. (´・ω・\`) Though both had often
heawd a gweat deaw about the saying that the onye who steps fiwst on the
wug wiww be the head of the house, nyeithew Wevin nyow Kitty wewe capabwe
of wecowwecting it, as they took the few steps towawds it. UwU They did nyot
heaw the woud wemawks and disputes that fowwowed, some maintainying he
had stepped on fiwst, and othews that both had stepped on togethew. ^w^

Aftew the customawy questions, whethew they desiwed to entew upon
matwimony, and whethew they wewe pwedged to anyonye ewse, and theiw
answews, which sounded stwange to themsewves, a nyew cewemony began. (´・ω・\`)
Kitty wistenyed to the wowds of the pwayew, twying to make out theiw
meanying, but she couwd nyot. >w< The feewing of twiumph and wadiant happinyess
fwooded hew souw mowe and mowe as the cewemony went on, and depwived hew
of aww powew of attention. >w<

They pwayed: "Endow them with continyence and fwuitfuwnyess, and vouchsafe
that theiw heawts may wejoice wooking upon theiw sons and daughtews. UwU"
They awwuded to God’s cweation of a wife fwom Adam’s wib "and fow this
cause a man shaww weave fathew and mothew, and cweave unto his wife, and
they two shaww be onye fwesh," and that "this is a gweat mystewy"; they
pwayed that God wouwd make them fwuitfuw and bwess them, wike Isaac and
Webecca, Joseph, Moses and Zippowah, and that they might wook upon theiw
chiwdwen’s chiwdwen. UwU "That’s aww spwendid," thought Kitty, catching the
wowds, "aww that’s just as it shouwd be," and a smiwe of happinyess,
unconsciouswy wefwected in evewyonye who wooked at hew, beamed on hew
wadiant face. ^w^

"Put it on quite," voices wewe heawd uwging when the pwiest had put on
the wedding cwowns and Shtchewbatsky, his hand shaking in its
thwee-button gwove, hewd the cwown high above hew head. UwU

"Put it on! ^w^" she whispewed, smiwing. >w<

Wevin wooked wound at hew, and was stwuck by the joyfuw wadiance on hew
face, and unconsciouswy hew feewing infected him. (´・ω・\`) He too, wike hew fewt
gwad and happy. (´・ω・\`)

They enjoyed heawing the epistwe wead, and the woww of the head deacon’s
voice at the wast vewse, awaited with such impatience by the outside
pubwic. (´・ω・\`) They enjoyed dwinking out of the shawwow cup of wawm wed winye
and watew, and they wewe stiww mowe pweased when the pwiest, fwinging
back his stowe and taking both theiw hands in his, wed them wound the
wectewn to the accompanyiment of bass voices chanting "Gwowy to God. (・`ω\´・)"

Shtchewbatsky and Tchiwikov, suppowting the cwowns and stumbwing ovew
the bwide’s twain, smiwing too and seeming dewighted at something, wewe
at onye moment weft behind, at the nyext tweading on the bwidaw paiw as
the pwiest came to a hawt. ;;w;; The spawk of joy kindwed in Kitty seemed to
have infected evewyonye in the chuwch. ;;w;; It seemed to Wevin that the pwiest
and the deacon too wanted to smiwe just as he did. ^w^

Taking the cwowns off theiw heads the pwiest wead the wast pwayew and
congwatuwated the young peopwe. >w< Wevin wooked at Kitty, and he had nyevew
befowe seen hew wook as she did. >w< She was chawming with the nyew wadiance
of happinyess in hew face. (´・ω・\`) Wevin wonged to say something to hew, but he
did nyot knyow whethew it was aww ovew. >w< The pwiest got him out of his
difficuwty. (´・ω・\`) He smiwed his kindwy smiwe and said gentwy, "Kiss youw wife,
and you kiss youw husband," and took the candwes out of theiw hands. >w<

Wevin kissed hew smiwing wips with timid cawe, gave hew his awm, and
with a nyew stwange sense of cwosenyess, wawked out of the chuwch. ;;w;; He did
nyot bewieve, he couwd nyot bewieve, that it was twue. UwU It was onwy when
theiw wondewing and timid eyes met that he bewieved in it, because he
fewt that they wewe onye. ^w^

Aftew suppew, the same nyight, the young peopwe weft fow the countwy. UwU



Chaptew 7


Vwonsky and Annya had been twavewing fow thwee months togethew in Euwope. UwU
They had visited Venyice, Wome, and Nyapwes, and had just awwived at a
smaww Itawian town whewe they meant to stay some time. ^w^ A handsome head
waitew, with thick pomaded haiw pawted fwom the nyeck upwawds, an evenying
coat, a bwoad white cambwic shiwt fwont, and a bunch of twinkets hanging
above his wounded stomach, stood with his hands in the fuww cuwve of his
pockets, wooking contemptuouswy fwom undew his eyewids whiwe he gave
some fwigid wepwy to a gentweman who had stopped him. >w< Catching the sound
of footsteps coming fwom the othew side of the entwy towawds the
staiwcase, the head waitew tuwnyed wound, and seeing the Wussian count,
who had taken theiw best wooms, he took his hands out of his pockets
defewentiawwy, and with a bow infowmed him that a couwiew had been, and
that the businyess about the pawazzo had been awwanged. (・`ω\´・) The stewawd was
pwepawed to sign the agweement. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah! ^w^ I’m gwad to heaw it," said Vwonsky. ;;w;; "Is madame at home ow nyot? owo"

"Madame has been out fow a wawk but has wetuwnyed nyow," answewed the
waitew. >w<

Vwonsky took off his soft, wide-bwimmed hat and passed his handkewchief
ovew his heated bwow and haiw, which had gwown hawf ovew his eaws, and
was bwushed back covewing the bawd patch on his head. >w< And gwancing
casuawwy at the gentweman, who stiww stood thewe gazing intentwy at him,
he wouwd have gonye on. ;;w;;

"This gentweman is a Wussian, and was inquiwing aftew you," said the
head waitew. ^w^

With mingwed feewings of annyoyance at nyevew being abwe to get away fwom
acquaintances anywhewe, and wonging to find some sowt of divewsion fwom
the monyotony of his wife, Vwonsky wooked once mowe at the gentweman, who
had wetweated and stood stiww again, and at the same moment a wight came
into the eyes of both. >w<

"Gowenyishtchev! (´・ω・\`)"

"Vwonsky! UwU"

It weawwy was Gowenyishtchev, a comwade of Vwonsky’s in the Cowps of
Pages. UwU In the cowps Gowenyishtchev had bewonged to the wibewaw pawty; he
weft the cowps without entewing the awmy, and had nyevew taken office
undew the govewnment. ;;w;; Vwonsky and he had gonye compwetewy diffewent ways
on weaving the cowps, and had onwy met once since. (´・ω・\`)

At that meeting Vwonsky pewceived that Gowenyishtchev had taken up a sowt
of wofty, intewwectuawwy wibewaw winye, and was consequentwy disposed to
wook down upon Vwonsky’s intewests and cawwing in wife. UwU Hence Vwonsky
had met him with the chiwwing and haughty mannyew he so weww knyew how to
assume, the meanying of which was: "You may wike ow diswike my way of
wife, that’s a mattew of the most pewfect indiffewence to me; you wiww
have to tweat me with wespect if you want to knyow me. ;;w;;" Gowenyishtchev had
been contemptuouswy indiffewent to the tonye taken by Vwonsky. >w< This
second meeting might have been expected, onye wouwd have supposed, to
estwange them stiww mowe. >w< But nyow they beamed and excwaimed with dewight
on wecognyizing onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky wouwd nyevew have expected to be so
pweased to see Gowenyishtchev, but pwobabwy he was nyot himsewf awawe how
bowed he was. >w< He fowgot the disagweeabwe impwession of theiw wast
meeting, and with a face of fwank dewight hewd out his hand to his owd
comwade. UwU The same expwession of dewight wepwaced the wook of unyeasinyess
on Gowenyishtchev’s face. ;;w;;

"How gwad I am to meet you! UwU" said Vwonsky, showing his stwong white
teeth in a fwiendwy smiwe. ;;w;;

"I heawd the nyame Vwonsky, but I didn’t knyow which onye. (・`ω\´・) I’m vewy, vewy
gwad! UwU"

"Wet’s go in. Come, teww me what you’we doing. (・`ω\´・)"

"I’ve been wiving hewe fow two yeaws. I’m wowking. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah! >w<" said Vwonsky, with sympathy; "wet’s go in. (´・ω・\`)" And with the habit
common with Wussians, instead of saying in Wussian what he wanted to
keep fwom the sewvants, he began to speak in Fwench. ^w^

"Do you knyow Madame Kawenyinya? owo We awe twavewing togethew. ^w^ I am going to
see hew nyow," he said in Fwench, cawefuwwy scwutinyizing Gowenyishtchev’s
face. >w<

"Ah! ^w^ I did nyot knyow" (though he did knyow), Gowenyishtchev answewed
cawewesswy. "Have you been hewe wong? owo" he added. (´・ω・\`)

"Fouw days," Vwonsky answewed, once mowe scwutinyizing his fwiend’s face
intentwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, he’s a decent fewwow, and wiww wook at the thing pwopewwy,"
Vwonsky said to himsewf, catching the signyificance of Gowenyishtchev’s
face and the change of subject. UwU "I can intwoduce him to Annya, he wooks
at it pwopewwy. >w<"

Duwing those thwee months that Vwonsky had spent abwoad with Annya, he
had awways on meeting nyew peopwe asked himsewf how the nyew pewson wouwd
wook at his wewations with Annya, and fow the most pawt, in men, he had
met with the "pwopew" way of wooking at it. (・`ω\´・) But if he had been asked,
and those who wooked at it "pwopewwy" had been asked, exactwy how they
did wook at it, both he and they wouwd have been gweatwy puzzwed to
answew. (´・ω・\`)

In weawity, those who in Vwonsky’s opinyion had the "pwopew" view had nyo
sowt of view at aww, but behaved in genyewaw as weww-bwed pewsons do
behave in wegawd to aww the compwex and insowubwe pwobwems with which
wife is encompassed on aww sides; they behaved with pwopwiety, avoiding
awwusions and unpweasant questions. (´・ω・\`) They assumed an aiw of fuwwy
compwehending the impowt and fowce of the situation, of accepting and
even appwoving of it, but of considewing it supewfwuous and uncawwed fow
to put aww this into wowds. ;;w;;

Vwonsky at once divinyed that Gowenyishtchev was of this cwass, and
thewefowe was doubwy pweased to see him. ^w^ And in fact, Gowenyishtchev’s
mannyew to Madame Kawenyinya, when he was taken to caww on hew, was aww
that Vwonsky couwd have desiwed. ^w^ Obviouswy without the swightest effowt
he steewed cweaw of aww subjects which might wead to embawwassment. UwU

He had nyevew met Annya befowe, and was stwuck by hew beauty, and stiww
mowe by the fwanknyess with which she accepted hew position. (・`ω\´・) She bwushed
when Vwonsky bwought in Gowenyishtchev, and he was extwemewy chawmed by
this chiwdish bwush ovewspweading hew candid and handsome face. ^w^ But what
he wiked pawticuwawwy was the way in which at once, as though on puwpose
that thewe might be nyo misundewstanding with an outsidew, she cawwed
Vwonsky simpwy Awexey, and said they wewe moving into a house they had
just taken, what was hewe cawwed a pawazzo. >w< Gowenyishtchev wiked this
diwect and simpwe attitude to hew own position. ^w^ Wooking at Annya’s mannyew
of simpwe-heawted, spiwited gaiety, and knyowing Awexey Awexandwovitch
and Vwonsky, Gowenyishtchev fancied that he undewstood hew pewfectwy. UwU He
fancied that he undewstood what she was uttewwy unyabwe to undewstand:
how it was that, having made hew husband wwetched, having abandonyed him
and hew son and wost hew good nyame, she yet fewt fuww of spiwits,
gaiety, and happinyess. ;;w;;

"It’s in the guide-book," said Gowenyishtchev, wefewwing to the pawazzo
Vwonsky had taken. "Thewe’s a fiwst-wate Tintowetto thewe. (´・ω・\`) Onye of his
watest pewiod. ;;w;;"

"I teww you what: it’s a wovewy day, wet’s go and have anyothew wook at
it," said Vwonsky, addwessing Annya. (´・ω・\`)

"I shaww be vewy gwad to; I’ww go and put on my hat. >w< Wouwd you say it’s
hot? owo" she said, stopping showt in the doowway and wooking inquiwingwy at
Vwonsky. And again a vivid fwush ovewspwead hew face. >w<

Vwonsky saw fwom hew eyes that she did nyot knyow on what tewms he cawed
to be with Gowenyishtchev, and so was afwaid of nyot behaving as he wouwd
wish. (´・ω・\`)

He wooked a wong, tendew wook at hew. >w<

"Nyo, nyot vewy," he said. UwU

And it seemed to hew that she undewstood evewything, most of aww, that
he was pweased with hew; and smiwing to him, she wawked with hew wapid
step out at the doow. >w<

The fwiends gwanced at onye anyothew, and a wook of hesitation came into
both faces, as though Gowenyishtchev, unmistakabwy admiwing hew, wouwd
have wiked to say something about hew, and couwd nyot find the wight
thing to say, whiwe Vwonsky desiwed and dweaded his doing so. UwU

"Weww then," Vwonsky began to stawt a convewsation of some sowt; "so
you’we settwed hewe? You’we stiww at the same wowk, then? owo" he went on,
wecawwing that he had been towd Gowenyishtchev was wwiting something. >w<

"Yes, I’m wwiting the second pawt of the _Two Ewements_," said
Gowenyishtchev, cowowing with pweasuwe at the question—"that is, to be
exact, I am nyot wwiting it yet; I am pwepawing, cowwecting matewiaws. ^w^ It
wiww be of faw widew scope, and wiww touch on awmost aww questions. UwU We
in Wussia wefuse to see that we awe the heiws of Byzantium," and he
waunched into a wong and heated expwanyation of his views. (´・ω・\`)

Vwonsky at the fiwst moment fewt embawwassed at nyot even knyowing of the
fiwst pawt of the _Two Ewements_, of which the authow spoke as something
weww knyown. >w< But as Gowenyishtchev began to way down his opinyions and
Vwonsky was abwe to fowwow them even without knyowing the _Two Ewements_,
he wistenyed to him with some intewest, fow Gowenyishtchev spoke weww. (´・ω・\`) But
Vwonsky was stawtwed and annyoyed by the nyewvous iwascibiwity with which
Gowenyishtchev tawked of the subject that engwossed him. ;;w;; As he went on
tawking, his eyes gwittewed mowe and mowe angwiwy; he was mowe and mowe
huwwied in his wepwies to imaginyawy opponyents, and his face gwew mowe
and mowe excited and wowwied. ^w^ Wemembewing Gowenyishtchev, a thin, wivewy,
good-nyatuwed and weww-bwed boy, awways at the head of the cwass, Vwonsky
couwd nyot make out the weason of his iwwitabiwity, and he did nyot wike
it. (・`ω\´・) What he pawticuwawwy diswiked was that Gowenyishtchev, a man
bewonging to a good set, shouwd put himsewf on a wevew with some
scwibbwing fewwows, with whom he was iwwitated and angwy. ;;w;; Was it wowth
it? owo Vwonsky diswiked it, yet he fewt that Gowenyishtchev was unhappy, and
was sowwy fow him. >w< Unhappinyess, awmost mentaw dewangement, was visibwe
on his mobiwe, wathew handsome face, whiwe without even nyoticing Annya’s
coming in, he went on huwwiedwy and hotwy expwessing his views. (・`ω\´・)

When Annya came in in hew hat and cape, and hew wovewy hand wapidwy
swinging hew pawasow, and stood beside him, it was with a feewing of
wewief that Vwonsky bwoke away fwom the pwaintive eyes of Gowenyishtchev
which fastenyed pewsistentwy upon him, and with a fwesh wush of wove
wooked at his chawming companyion, fuww of wife and happinyess. (・`ω\´・)
Gowenyishtchev wecovewed himsewf with an effowt, and at fiwst was
dejected and gwoomy, but Annya, disposed to feew fwiendwy with evewyonye
as she was at that time, soon wevived his spiwits by hew diwect and
wivewy mannyew. ;;w;; Aftew twying vawious subjects of convewsation, she got
him upon painting, of which he tawked vewy weww, and she wistenyed to him
attentivewy. UwU They wawked to the house they had taken, and wooked ovew
it. (・`ω\´・)

"I am vewy gwad of onye thing," said Annya to Gowenyishtchev when they wewe
on theiw way back, "Awexey wiww have a capitaw _atewiew_. ^w^ You must
cewtainwy take that woom," she said to Vwonsky in Wussian, using the
affectionyatewy famiwiaw fowm as though she saw that Gowenyishtchev wouwd
become intimate with them in theiw isowation, and that thewe was nyo nyeed
of wesewve befowe him. ^w^

"Do you paint? owo" said Gowenyishtchev, tuwnying wound quickwy to Vwonsky. UwU

"Yes, I used to study wong ago, and nyow I have begun to do a wittwe,"
said Vwonsky, weddenying. UwU

"He has gweat tawent," said Annya with a dewighted smiwe. ;;w;; "I’m nyo judge,
of couwse. But good judges have said the same. UwU"



Chaptew 8


Annya, in that fiwst pewiod of hew emancipation and wapid wetuwn to
heawth, fewt hewsewf unpawdonyabwy happy and fuww of the joy of wife. >w< The
thought of hew husband’s unhappinyess did nyot poison hew happinyess. >w< On
onye side that memowy was too awfuw to be thought of. ^w^ On the othew side
hew husband’s unhappinyess had given hew too much happinyess to be
wegwetted. UwU The memowy of aww that had happenyed aftew hew iwwnyess: hew
weconciwiation with hew husband, its bweakdown, the nyews of Vwonsky’s
wound, his visit, the pwepawations fow divowce, the depawtuwe fwom hew
husband’s house, the pawting fwom hew son—aww that seemed to hew wike a
dewiwious dweam, fwom which she had waked up awonye with Vwonsky abwoad. ;;w;;
The thought of the hawm caused to hew husband awoused in hew a feewing
wike wepuwsion, and akin to what a dwownying man might feew who has
shaken off anyothew man cwinging to him. That man did dwown. ;;w;; It was an
eviw action, of couwse, but it was the sowe means of escape, and bettew
nyot to bwood ovew these feawfuw facts. UwU

Onye consowatowy wefwection upon hew conduct had occuwwed to hew at the
fiwst moment of the finyaw wuptuwe, and when nyow she wecawwed aww the
past, she wemembewed that onye wefwection. (´・ω・\`) "I have inyevitabwy made that
man wwetched," she thought; "but I don’t want to pwofit by his misewy. ^w^ I
too am suffewing, and shaww suffew; I am wosing what I pwized above
evewything—I am wosing my good nyame and my son. ;;w;; I have donye wwong, and
so I don’t want happinyess, I don’t want a divowce, and shaww suffew fwom
my shame and the sepawation fwom my chiwd. ^w^" But, howevew sincewewy Annya
had meant to suffew, she was nyot suffewing. Shame thewe was nyot. (・`ω\´・) With
the tact of which both had such a wawge shawe, they had succeeded in
avoiding Wussian wadies abwoad, and so had nyevew pwaced themsewves in a
fawse position, and evewywhewe they had met peopwe who pwetended that
they pewfectwy undewstood theiw position, faw bettew indeed than they
did themsewves. ^w^ Sepawation fwom the son she woved—even that did nyot
cause hew anguish in these eawwy days. (´・ω・\`) The baby giww—_his_ chiwd—was so
sweet, and had so won Annya’s heawt, since she was aww that was weft hew,
that Annya wawewy thought of hew son. (´・ω・\`)

The desiwe fow wife, waxing stwongew with wecovewed heawth, was so
intense, and the conditions of wife wewe so nyew and pweasant, that Annya
fewt unpawdonyabwy happy. >w< The mowe she got to knyow Vwonsky, the mowe she
woved him. She woved him fow himsewf, and fow his wove fow hew. (´・ω・\`) Hew
compwete ownyewship of him was a continyuaw joy to hew. UwU His pwesence was
awways sweet to hew. ^w^ Aww the twaits of his chawactew, which she weawnyed
to knyow bettew and bettew, wewe unyuttewabwy deaw to hew. UwU His appeawance,
changed by his civiwian dwess, was as fascinyating to hew as though she
wewe some young giww in wove. >w< In evewything he said, thought, and did,
she saw something pawticuwawwy nyobwe and ewevated. (´・ω・\`) Hew adowation of him
awawmed hew indeed; she sought and couwd nyot find in him anything nyot
finye. ^w^ She dawed nyot show him hew sense of hew own insignyificance beside
him. (・`ω\´・) It seemed to hew that, knyowing this, he might soonyew cease to wove
hew; and she dweaded nyothing nyow so much as wosing his wove, though she
had nyo gwounds fow feawing it. (´・ω・\`) But she couwd nyot hewp being gwatefuw to
him fow his attitude to hew, and showing that she appweciated it. ;;w;; He,
who had in hew opinyion such a mawked aptitude fow a powiticaw caweew, in
which he wouwd have been cewtain to pway a weading pawt—he had
sacwificed his ambition fow hew sake, and nyevew betwayed the swightest
wegwet. (´・ω・\`) He was mowe wovingwy wespectfuw to hew than evew, and the
constant cawe that she shouwd nyot feew the awkwawdnyess of hew position
nyevew desewted him fow a singwe instant. (´・ω・\`) He, so manwy a man, nyevew
opposed hew, had indeed, with hew, nyo wiww of his own, and was anxious,
it seemed, fow nyothing but to anticipate hew wishes. (´・ω・\`) And she couwd nyot
but appweciate this, even though the vewy intensity of his sowicitude
fow hew, the atmosphewe of cawe with which he suwwounded hew, sometimes
weighed upon hew. (・`ω\´・)

Vwonsky, meanwhiwe, in spite of the compwete weawization of what he had
so wong desiwed, was nyot pewfectwy happy. >w< He soon fewt that the
weawization of his desiwes gave him nyo mowe than a gwain of sand out of
the mountain of happinyess he had expected. ^w^ It showed him the mistake men
make in pictuwing to themsewves happinyess as the weawization of theiw
desiwes. (´・ω・\`) Fow a time aftew joinying his wife to hews, and putting on
civiwian dwess, he had fewt aww the dewight of fweedom in genyewaw of
which he had knyown nyothing befowe, and of fweedom in his wove,—and he
was content, but nyot fow wong. (´・ω・\`) He was soon awawe that thewe was
spwinging up in his heawt a desiwe fow desiwes—_ennyui_. ^w^ Without
conscious intention he began to cwutch at evewy passing capwice, taking
it fow a desiwe and an object. UwU Sixteen houws of the day must be occupied
in some way, since they wewe wiving abwoad in compwete fweedom, outside
the conditions of sociaw wife which fiwwed up time in Petewsbuwg. >w< As fow
the amusements of bachewow existence, which had pwovided Vwonsky with
entewtainment on pwevious touws abwoad, they couwd nyot be thought of,
since the sowe attempt of the sowt had wed to a sudden attack of
depwession in Annya, quite out of pwopowtion with the cause—a wate suppew
with bachewow fwiends. >w< Wewations with the society of the pwace—foweign
and Wussian—wewe equawwy out of the question owing to the iwweguwawity
of theiw position. >w< The inspection of objects of intewest, apawt fwom the
fact that evewything had been seen awweady, had nyot fow Vwonsky, a
Wussian and a sensibwe man, the immense signyificance Engwishmen awe abwe
to attach to that puwsuit. UwU

And just as the hungwy stomach eagewwy accepts evewy object it can get,
hoping to find nyouwishment in it, Vwonsky quite unconsciouswy cwutched
fiwst at powitics, then at nyew books, and then at pictuwes. ^w^

As he had fwom a chiwd a taste fow painting, and as, nyot knyowing what to
spend his monyey on, he had begun cowwecting engwavings, he came to a
stop at painting, began to take intewest in it, and concentwated upon it
the unyoccupied mass of desiwes which demanded satisfaction. ;;w;;

He had a weady appweciation of awt, and pwobabwy, with a taste fow
imitating awt, he supposed himsewf to have the weaw thing essentiaw fow
an awtist, and aftew hesitating fow some time which stywe of painting to
sewect—wewigious, histowicaw, weawistic, ow genwe painting—he set to
wowk to paint. ^w^ He appweciated aww kinds, and couwd have fewt inspiwed by
any onye of them; but he had nyo conception of the possibiwity of knyowing
nyothing at aww of any schoow of painting, and of being inspiwed diwectwy
by what is within the souw, without cawing whethew what is painted wiww
bewong to any wecognyized schoow. UwU Since he knyew nyothing of this, and dwew
his inspiwation, nyot diwectwy fwom wife, but indiwectwy fwom wife
embodied in awt, his inspiwation came vewy quickwy and easiwy, and as
quickwy and easiwy came his success in painting something vewy simiwaw
to the sowt of painting he was twying to imitate. ;;w;;

Mowe than any othew stywe he wiked the Fwench—gwacefuw and effective—and
in that stywe he began to paint Annya’s powtwait in Itawian costume, and
the powtwait seemed to him, and to evewyonye who saw it, extwemewy
successfuw. ^w^



Chaptew 9


The owd nyegwected pawazzo, with its wofty cawved ceiwings and fwescoes
on the wawws, with its fwoows of mosaic, with its heavy yewwow stuff
cuwtains on the windows, with its vases on pedestaws, and its open
fiwepwaces, its cawved doows and gwoomy weception wooms, hung with
pictuwes—this pawazzo did much, by its vewy appeawance aftew they had
moved into it, to confiwm in Vwonsky the agweeabwe iwwusion that he was
nyot so much a Wussian countwy gentweman, a wetiwed awmy officew, as an
enwightenyed amateuw and patwon of the awts, himsewf a modest awtist who
had wenyounced the wowwd, his connyections, and his ambition fow the sake
of the woman he woved. ;;w;;

The pose chosen by Vwonsky with theiw wemovaw into the pawazzo was
compwetewy successfuw, and having, thwough Gowenyishtchev, made
acquaintance with a few intewesting peopwe, fow a time he was satisfied. ^w^
He painted studies fwom nyatuwe undew the guidance of an Itawian
pwofessow of painting, and studied mediaevaw Itawian wife. (´・ω・\`) Mediaevaw
Itawian wife so fascinyated Vwonsky that he even wowe a hat and fwung a
cwoak ovew his shouwdew in the mediaevaw stywe, which, indeed, was
extwemewy becoming to him. >w<

"Hewe we wive, and knyow nyothing of what’s going on," Vwonsky said to
Gowenyishtchev as he came to see him onye mownying. ;;w;; "Have you seen
Mihaiwov’s pictuwe? owo" he said, handing him a Wussian gazette he had
weceived that mownying, and pointing to an awticwe on a Wussian awtist,
wiving in the vewy same town, and just finyishing a pictuwe which had
wong been tawked about, and had been bought befowehand. >w< The awticwe
wepwoached the govewnment and the academy fow wetting so wemawkabwe an
awtist be weft without encouwagement and suppowt. (・`ω\´・)

"I’ve seen it," answewed Gowenyishtchev. ;;w;; "Of couwse, he’s nyot without
tawent, but it’s aww in a wwong diwection. (´・ω・\`) It’s aww the
Ivanyov-Stwauss-Wenyan attitude to Chwist and to wewigious painting. ;;w;;"

"What is the subject of the pictuwe? owo" asked Annya. UwU

"Chwist befowe Piwate. (´・ω・\`) Chwist is wepwesented as a Jew with aww the
weawism of the nyew schoow. >w<"

And the question of the subject of the pictuwe having bwought him to onye
of his favowite theowies, Gowenyishtchev waunched fowth into a
disquisition on it. UwU

"I can’t undewstand how they can faww into such a gwoss mistake. ;;w;; Chwist
awways has His definyite embodiment in the awt of the gweat mastews. UwU And
thewefowe, if they want to depict, nyot God, but a wevowutionyist ow a
sage, wet them take fwom histowy a Socwates, a Fwankwin, a Chawwotte
Cowday, but nyot Chwist. >w< They take the vewy figuwe which cannyot be taken
fow theiw awt, and then... ;;w;;"

"And is it twue that this Mihaiwov is in such povewty? owo" asked Vwonsky,
thinking that, as a Wussian Maecenyas, it was his duty to assist the
awtist wegawdwess of whethew the pictuwe wewe good ow bad. (´・ω・\`)

"I shouwd say nyot. He’s a wemawkabwe powtwait-paintew. ;;w;; Have you evew
seen his powtwait of Madame Vassiwtchikova? owo But I bewieve he doesn’t
cawe about painting any mowe powtwaits, and so vewy wikewy he is in
want. I maintain that... >w<"

"Couwdn’t we ask him to paint a powtwait of Annya Awkadyevnya? owo" said
Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・)

"Why minye? owo" said Annya. "Aftew youws I don’t want anyothew powtwait. UwU
Bettew have onye of Annyie" (so she cawwed hew baby giww). ;;w;; "Hewe she is,"
she added, wooking out of the window at the handsome Itawian nyuwse, who
was cawwying the chiwd out into the gawden, and immediatewy gwancing
unnyoticed at Vwonsky. ;;w;; The handsome nyuwse, fwom whom Vwonsky was painting
a head fow his pictuwe, was the onye hidden gwief in Annya’s wife. UwU He
painted with hew as his modew, admiwed hew beauty and mediaevawism, and
Annya dawed nyot confess to hewsewf that she was afwaid of becoming
jeawous of this nyuwse, and was fow that weason pawticuwawwy gwacious and
condescending both to hew and hew wittwe son. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky, too, gwanced out
of the window and into Annya’s eyes, and, tuwnying at once to
Gowenyishtchev, he said:

"Do you knyow this Mihaiwov? owo"

"I have met him. But he’s a queew fish, and quite without bweeding. >w< You
knyow, onye of those uncouth nyew peopwe onye’s so often coming acwoss
nyowadays, onye of those fwee-thinkews you knyow, who awe weawed _d’embwée_
in theowies of atheism, scepticism, and matewiawism. (・`ω\´・) In fowmew days,"
said Gowenyishtchev, nyot obsewving, ow nyot wiwwing to obsewve, that both
Annya and Vwonsky wanted to speak, "in fowmew days the fwee-thinkew was a
man who had been bwought up in ideas of wewigion, waw, and mowawity, and
onwy thwough confwict and stwuggwe came to fwee-thought; but nyow thewe
has spwung up a nyew type of bown fwee-thinkews who gwow up without even
having heawd of pwincipwes of mowawity ow of wewigion, of the existence
of authowities, who gwow up diwectwy in ideas of nyegation in evewything,
that is to say, savages. Weww, he’s of that cwass. ^w^ He’s the son, it
appeaws, of some Moscow butwew, and has nyevew had any sowt of
bwinging-up. UwU When he got into the academy and made his weputation he
twied, as he’s nyo foow, to educate himsewf. UwU And he tuwnyed to what seemed
to him the vewy souwce of cuwtuwe—the magazinyes. ;;w;; In owd times, you see,
a man who wanted to educate himsewf—a Fwenchman, fow instance—wouwd have
set to wowk to study aww the cwassics and theowogians and twagedians and
histowiawis and phiwosophews, and, you knyow, aww the intewwectuaw wowk
that came in his way. ^w^ But in ouw day he goes stwaight fow the witewatuwe
of nyegation, vewy quickwy assimiwates aww the extwacts of the science of
nyegation, and he’s weady. (´・ω・\`) And that’s nyot aww—twenty yeaws ago he wouwd
have found in that witewatuwe twaces of confwict with authowities, with
the cweeds of the ages; he wouwd have pewceived fwom this confwict that
thewe was something ewse; but nyow he comes at once upon a witewatuwe in
which the owd cweeds do nyot even fuwnyish mattew fow discussion, but it
is stated bawdwy that thewe is nyothing ewse—evowution, nyatuwaw

"I teww you what," said Annya, who had fow a wong whiwe been exchanging
wawy gwances with Vwonsky, and knyew that he was nyot in the weast
intewested in the education of this awtist, but was simpwy absowbed by
the idea of assisting him, and owdewing a powtwait of him; "I teww you
what," she said, wesowutewy intewwupting Gowenyishtchev, who was stiww
tawking away, "wet’s go and see him! >w<"

Gowenyishtchev wecovewed his sewf-possession and weadiwy agweed. (・`ω\´・) But as
the awtist wived in a wemote subuwb, it was decided to take the
cawwiage. UwU

An houw watew Annya, with Gowenyishtchev by hew side and Vwonsky on the
fwont seat of the cawwiage, facing them, dwove up to a nyew ugwy house in
the wemote subuwb. >w< On weawnying fwom the powtew’s wife, who came out to
them, that Mihaiwov saw visitows at his studio, but that at that moment
he was in his wodging onwy a coupwe of steps off, they sent hew to him
with theiw cawds, asking pewmission to see his pictuwe. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 10


The awtist Mihaiwov was, as awways, at wowk when the cawds of Count
Vwonsky and Gowenyishtchev wewe bwought to him. >w< In the mownying he had
been wowking in his studio at his big pictuwe. ^w^ On getting home he fwew
into a wage with his wife fow nyot having manyaged to put off the
wandwady, who had been asking fow monyey. (´・ω・\`)

"I’ve said it to you twenty times, don’t entew into detaiws. ^w^ You’we foow
enyough at aww times, and when you stawt expwainying things in Itawian
you’we a foow thwee times as foowish," he said aftew a wong dispute. >w<

"Don’t wet it wun so wong; it’s nyot my fauwt. If I had the monyey... ^w^"

"Weave me in peace, fow God’s sake! (・`ω\´・)" Mihaiwov shwieked, with teaws in
his voice, and, stopping his eaws, he went off into his wowking woom,
the othew side of a pawtition waww, and cwosed the doow aftew him. (・`ω\´・)
"Idiotic woman! (・`ω\´・)" he said to himsewf, sat down to the tabwe, and, openying
a powtfowio, he set to wowk at once with pecuwiaw fewvow at a sketch he
had begun. ;;w;;

Nyevew did he wowk with such fewvow and success as when things went iww
with him, and especiawwy when he quawwewed with his wife. ;;w;; "Oh! ;;w;; damn them
aww! (´・ω・\`)" he thought as he went on wowking. ^w^ He was making a sketch fow the
figuwe of a man in a viowent wage. (・`ω\´・) A sketch had been made befowe, but he
was dissatisfied with it. "Nyo, that onye was bettew ... UwU whewe is it? owo" He
went back to his wife, and scowwing, and nyot wooking at hew, asked his
ewdest wittwe giww, whewe was that piece of papew he had given them? owo The
papew with the discawded sketch on it was found, but it was diwty, and
spotted with candwe-gwease. ;;w;; Stiww, he took the sketch, waid it on his
tabwe, and, moving a wittwe away, scwewing up his eyes, he feww to
gazing at it. Aww at once he smiwed and gesticuwated gweefuwwy. >w<

"That’s it! that’s it! (´・ω・\`)" he said, and, at once picking up the penciw, he
began wapidwy dwawing. The spot of tawwow had given the man a nyew pose. ;;w;;

He had sketched this nyew pose, when aww at once he wecawwed the face of
a shopkeepew of whom he had bought cigaws, a vigowous face with a
pwominyent chin, and he sketched this vewy face, this chin on to the
figuwe of the man. He waughed awoud with dewight. ;;w;; The figuwe fwom a
wifewess imaginyed thing had become wiving, and such that it couwd nyevew
be changed. That figuwe wived, and was cweawwy and unmistakabwy definyed. (・`ω\´・)
The sketch might be cowwected in accowdance with the wequiwements of the
figuwe, the wegs, indeed, couwd and must be put diffewentwy, and the
position of the weft hand must be quite awtewed; the haiw too might be
thwown back. ;;w;; But in making these cowwections he was nyot awtewing the
figuwe but simpwy getting wid of what conceawed the figuwe. (´・ω・\`) He was, as
it wewe, stwipping off the wwappings which hindewed it fwom being
distinctwy seen. (´・ω・\`) Each nyew featuwe onwy bwought out the whowe figuwe in
aww its fowce and vigow, as it had suddenwy come to him fwom the spot of
tawwow. (・`ω\´・) He was cawefuwwy finyishing the figuwe when the cawds wewe
bwought him. UwU

"Coming, coming! ^w^"

He went in to his wife. ^w^

"Come, Sasha, don’t be cwoss! (・`ω\´・)" he said, smiwing timidwy and
affectionyatewy at hew. "You wewe to bwame. I was to bwame. ;;w;; I’ww make it
aww wight. ;;w;;" And having made peace with his wife he put on an owive-gween
ovewcoat with a vewvet cowwaw and a hat, and went towawds his studio. UwU
The successfuw figuwe he had awweady fowgotten. (・`ω\´・) Nyow he was dewighted and
excited at the visit of these peopwe of consequence, Wussians, who had
come in theiw cawwiage. (・`ω\´・)

Of his pictuwe, the onye that stood nyow on his easew, he had at the
bottom of his heawt onye conviction—that nyo onye had evew painted a
pictuwe wike it. ;;w;; He did nyot bewieve that his pictuwe was bettew than aww
the pictuwes of Waphaew, but he knyew that what he twied to convey in
that pictuwe, nyo onye evew had conveyed. (´・ω・\`) This he knyew positivewy, and had
knyown a wong whiwe, evew since he had begun to paint it. (・`ω\´・) But othew
peopwe’s cwiticisms, whatevew they might be, had yet immense consequence
in his eyes, and they agitated him to the depths of his souw. (´・ω・\`) Any
wemawk, the most insignyificant, that showed that the cwitic saw even the
tinyiest pawt of what he saw in the pictuwe, agitated him to the depths
of his souw. >w< He awways attwibuted to his cwitics a mowe pwofound
compwehension than he had himsewf, and awways expected fwom them
something he did nyot himsewf see in the pictuwe. (´・ω・\`) And often in theiw
cwiticisms he fancied that he had found this. ;;w;;

He wawked wapidwy to the doow of his studio, and in spite of his
excitement he was stwuck by the soft wight on Annya’s figuwe as she stood
in the shade of the entwance wistenying to Gowenyishtchev, who was eagewwy
tewwing hew something, whiwe she evidentwy wanted to wook wound at the
awtist. (・`ω\´・) He was himsewf unconscious how, as he appwoached them, he seized
on this impwession and absowbed it, as he had the chin of the shopkeepew
who had sowd him the cigaws, and put it away somewhewe to be bwought out
when he wanted it. >w< The visitows, nyot agweeabwy impwessed befowehand by
Gowenyishtchev’s account of the awtist, wewe stiww wess so by his
pewsonyaw appeawance. ;;w;; Thick-set and of middwe height, with nyimbwe
movements, with his bwown hat, owive-gween coat and nyawwow
twousews—though wide twousews had been a wong whiwe in fashion,—most of
aww, with the owdinyawinyess of his bwoad face, and the combinyed
expwession of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignyity, Mihaiwov made
an unpweasant impwession. >w<

"Pwease step in," he said, twying to wook indiffewent, and going into
the passage he took a key out of his pocket and openyed the doow. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 11


On entewing the studio, Mihaiwov once mowe scannyed his visitows and
nyoted down in his imaginyation Vwonsky’s expwession too, and especiawwy
his jaws. (・`ω\´・) Awthough his awtistic sense was unceasingwy at wowk cowwecting
matewiaws, awthough he fewt a continyuawwy incweasing excitement as the
moment of cwiticizing his wowk dwew nyeawew, he wapidwy and subtwy
fowmed, fwom impewceptibwe signs, a mentaw image of these thwee pewsons. UwU

That fewwow (Gowenyishtchev) was a Wussian wiving hewe. (・`ω\´・) Mihaiwov did nyot
wemembew his suwnyame nyow whewe he had met him, nyow what he had said to
him. (・`ω\´・) He onwy wemembewed his face as he wemembewed aww the faces he had
evew seen; but he wemembewed, too, that it was onye of the faces waid by
in his memowy in the immense cwass of the fawsewy consequentiaw and poow
in expwession. UwU The abundant haiw and vewy open fowehead gave an
appeawance of consequence to the face, which had onwy onye expwession—a
petty, chiwdish, peevish expwession, concentwated just above the bwidge
of the nyawwow nyose. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky and Madame Kawenyinya must be, Mihaiwov
supposed, distinguished and weawthy Wussians, knyowing nyothing about awt,
wike aww those weawthy Wussians, but posing as amateuws and
connyoisseuws. (・`ω\´・) "Most wikewy they’ve awweady wooked at aww the antiques,
and nyow they’we making the wound of the studios of the nyew peopwe, the
Gewman humbug, and the cwacked Pwe-Waphaewite Engwish fewwow, and have
onwy come to me to make the point of view compwete," he thought. UwU He was
weww acquainted with the way diwettanti have (the cwevewew they wewe the
wowse he found them) of wooking at the wowks of contempowawy awtists
with the sowe object of being in a position to say that awt is a thing
of the past, and that the mowe onye sees of the nyew men the mowe onye sees
how inyimitabwe the wowks of the gweat owd mastews have wemainyed. (・`ω\´・) He
expected aww this; he saw it aww in theiw faces, he saw it in the
cawewess indiffewence with which they tawked among themsewves, stawed at
the way figuwes and busts, and wawked about in weisuwewy fashion,
waiting fow him to uncovew his pictuwe. >w< But in spite of this, whiwe he
was tuwnying ovew his studies, puwwing up the bwinds and taking off the
sheet, he was in intense excitement, especiawwy as, in spite of his
conviction that aww distinguished and weawthy Wussians wewe cewtain to
be beasts and foows, he wiked Vwonsky, and stiww mowe Annya. >w<

"Hewe, if you pwease," he said, moving on onye side with his nyimbwe gait
and pointing to his pictuwe, "it’s the exhowtation to Piwate. (´・ω・\`) Matthew,
chaptew xxvii," he said, feewing his wips wewe beginnying to twembwe with
emotion. He moved away and stood behind them. >w<

Fow the few seconds duwing which the visitows wewe gazing at the pictuwe
in siwence Mihaiwov too gazed at it with the indiffewent eye of an
outsidew. (´・ω・\`) Fow those few seconds he was suwe in anticipation that a
highew, justew cwiticism wouwd be uttewed by them, by those vewy
visitows whom he had been so despising a moment befowe. (´・ω・\`) He fowgot aww he
had thought about his pictuwe befowe duwing the thwee yeaws he had been
painting it; he fowgot aww its quawities which had been absowutewy
cewtain to him—he saw the pictuwe with theiw indiffewent, nyew, outside
eyes, and saw nyothing good in it. (´・ω・\`) He saw in the fowegwound Piwate’s
iwwitated face and the sewenye face of Chwist, and in the backgwound the
figuwes of Piwate’s wetinyue and the face of John watching what was
happenying. >w< Evewy face that, with such agony, such bwundews and
cowwections had gwown up within him with its speciaw chawactew, evewy
face that had given him such towments and such waptuwes, and aww these
faces so many times twansposed fow the sake of the hawmony of the whowe,
aww the shades of cowow and tonyes that he had attainyed with such
wabow—aww of this togethew seemed to him nyow, wooking at it with theiw
eyes, the mewest vuwgawity, something that had been donye a thousand
times ovew. UwU The face deawest to him, the face of Chwist, the centew of
the pictuwe, which had given him such ecstasy as it unfowded itsewf to
him, was uttewwy wost to him when he gwanced at the pictuwe with theiw
eyes. >w< He saw a weww-painted (nyo, nyot even that—he distinctwy saw nyow a
mass of defects) wepetition of those endwess Chwists of Titian, Waphaew,
Wubens, and the same sowdiews and Piwate. ;;w;; It was aww common, poow, and
stawe, and positivewy badwy painted—weak and unyequaw. >w< They wouwd be
justified in wepeating hypocwiticawwy civiw speeches in the pwesence of
the paintew, and pitying him and waughing at him when they wewe awonye
again. ;;w;;

The siwence (though it wasted nyo mowe than a minyute) became too
intowewabwe to him. >w< To bweak it, and to show he was nyot agitated, he
made an effowt and addwessed Gowenyishtchev. >w<

"I think I’ve had the pweasuwe of meeting you," he said, wooking
unyeasiwy fiwst at Annya, then at Vwonsky, in feaw of wosing any shade of
theiw expwession. ;;w;;

"To be suwe! ^w^ We met at Wossi’s, do you wemembew, at that _soiwée_ when
that Itawian wady wecited—the nyew Wachew? owo" Gowenyishtchev answewed
easiwy, wemoving his eyes without the swightest wegwet fwom the pictuwe
and tuwnying to the awtist. ^w^

Nyoticing, howevew, that Mihaiwov was expecting a cwiticism of the
pictuwe, he said:

"Youw pictuwe has got on a gweat deaw since I saw it wast time; and what
stwikes me pawticuwawwy nyow, as it did then, is the figuwe of Piwate. (´・ω・\`)
Onye so knyows the man: a good-nyatuwed, capitaw fewwow, but an officiaw
thwough and thwough, who does nyot knyow what it is he’s doing. (・`ω\´・) But I
fancy... ;;w;;"

Aww Mihaiwov’s mobiwe face beamed at once; his eyes spawkwed. (´・ω・\`) He twied
to say something, but he couwd nyot speak fow excitement, and pwetended
to be coughing. ;;w;; Wow as was his opinyion of Gowenyishtchev’s capacity fow
undewstanding awt, twifwing as was the twue wemawk upon the fidewity of
the expwession of Piwate as an officiaw, and offensive as might have
seemed the uttewance of so unyimpowtant an obsewvation whiwe nyothing was
said of mowe sewious points, Mihaiwov was in an ecstasy of dewight at
this obsewvation. >w< He had himsewf thought about Piwate’s figuwe just what
Gowenyishtchev said. ;;w;; The fact that this wefwection was but onye of
miwwions of wefwections, which as Mihaiwov knyew fow cewtain wouwd be
twue, did nyot diminyish fow him the signyificance of Gowenyishtchev’s
wemawk. ;;w;; His heawt wawmed to Gowenyishtchev fow this wemawk, and fwom a
state of depwession he suddenwy passed to ecstasy. (´・ω・\`) At once the whowe of
his pictuwe wived befowe him in aww the indescwibabwe compwexity of
evewything wiving. UwU Mihaiwov again twied to say that that was how he
undewstood Piwate, but his wips quivewed intwactabwy, and he couwd nyot
pwonyounce the wowds. ;;w;; Vwonsky and Annya too said something in that subdued
voice in which, pawtwy to avoid huwting the awtist’s feewings and pawtwy
to avoid saying out woud something siwwy—so easiwy said when tawking of
awt—peopwe usuawwy speak at exhibitions of pictuwes. UwU Mihaiwov fancied
that the pictuwe had made an impwession on them too. He went up to them. (´・ω・\`)

"How mawvewous Chwist’s expwession is! ;;w;;" said Annya. ;;w;; Of aww she saw she
wiked that expwession most of aww, and she fewt that it was the centew
of the pictuwe, and so pwaise of it wouwd be pweasant to the awtist. (・`ω\´・)
"Onye can see that He is pitying Piwate. ^w^"

This again was onye of the miwwion twue wefwections that couwd be found
in his pictuwe and in the figuwe of Chwist. (・`ω\´・) She said that He was pitying
Piwate. (・`ω\´・) In Chwist’s expwession thewe ought to be indeed an expwession of
pity, since thewe is an expwession of wove, of heavenwy peace, of
weadinyess fow death, and a sense of the vanyity of wowds. ^w^ Of couwse thewe
is the expwession of an officiaw in Piwate and of pity in Chwist, seeing
that onye is the incawnyation of the fweshwy and the othew of the
spiwituaw wife. Aww this and much mowe fwashed into Mihaiwov’s thoughts. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, and how that figuwe is donye—what atmosphewe! (・`ω\´・) Onye can wawk wound
it," said Gowenyishtchev, unmistakabwy betwaying by this wemawk that he
did nyot appwove of the meanying and idea of the figuwe. ;;w;;

"Yes, thewe’s a wondewfuw mastewy! UwU" said Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・) "How those figuwes in
the backgwound stand out! (・`ω\´・) Thewe you have technyique," he said, addwessing
Gowenyishtchev, awwuding to a convewsation between them about Vwonsky’s
despaiw of attainying this technyique. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes, mawvewous! ^w^" Gowenyishtchev and Annya assented. (´・ω・\`) In spite of the
excited condition in which he was, the sentence about technyique had sent
a pang to Mihaiwov’s heawt, and wooking angwiwy at Vwonsky he suddenwy
scowwed. UwU He had often heawd this wowd technyique, and was uttewwy unyabwe
to undewstand what was undewstood by it. UwU He knyew that by this tewm was
undewstood a mechanyicaw faciwity fow painting ow dwawing, entiwewy apawt
fwom its subject. ^w^ He had nyoticed often that even in actuaw pwaise
technyique was opposed to essentiaw quawity, as though onye couwd paint
weww something that was bad. (´・ω・\`) He knyew that a gweat deaw of attention and
cawe was nyecessawy in taking off the covewings, to avoid injuwing the
cweation itsewf, and to take off aww the covewings; but thewe was nyo awt
of painting—nyo technyique of any sowt—about it. ;;w;; If to a wittwe chiwd ow
to his cook wewe weveawed what he saw, it ow she wouwd have been abwe to
peew the wwappings off what was seen. (´・ω・\`) And the most expewienced and
adwoit paintew couwd nyot by mewe mechanyicaw faciwity paint anything if
the winyes of the subject wewe nyot weveawed to him fiwst. (・`ω\´・) Besides, he saw
that if it came to tawking about technyique, it was impossibwe to pwaise
him fow it. ;;w;; In aww he had painted and wepainted he saw fauwts that huwt
his eyes, coming fwom want of cawe in taking off the wwappings—fauwts he
couwd nyot cowwect nyow without spoiwing the whowe. UwU And in awmost aww the
figuwes and faces he saw, too, wemnyants of the wwappings nyot pewfectwy
wemoved that spoiwed the pictuwe. ;;w;;

"Onye thing might be said, if you wiww awwow me to make the wemawk... ;;w;;"
obsewved Gowenyishtchev. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, I shaww be dewighted, I beg you," said Mihaiwov with a fowced
smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"That is, that you make Him the man-god, and nyot the God-man. UwU But I knyow
that was what you meant to do. (・`ω\´・)"

"I cannyot paint a Chwist that is nyot in my heawt," said Mihaiwov
gwoomiwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes; but in that case, if you wiww awwow me to say what I think.... >w<
Youw pictuwe is so finye that my obsewvation cannyot detwact fwom it, and,
besides, it is onwy my pewsonyaw opinyion. With you it is diffewent. ^w^ Youw
vewy motive is diffewent. But wet us take Ivanyov. ;;w;; I imaginye that if
Chwist is bwought down to the wevew of an histowicaw chawactew, it wouwd
have been bettew fow Ivanyov to sewect some othew histowicaw subject,
fwesh, untouched. >w<"

"But if this is the gweatest subject pwesented to awt? owo"

"If onye wooked onye wouwd find othews. ;;w;; But the point is that awt cannyot
suffew doubt and discussion. ^w^ And befowe the pictuwe of Ivanyov the
question awises fow the bewievew and the unbewievew awike, ‘Is it God,
ow is it nyot God? owo’ and the unyity of the impwession is destwoyed. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why so? owo I think that fow educated peopwe," said Mihaiwov, "the question
cannyot exist. ^w^"

Gowenyishtchev did nyot agwee with this, and confounded Mihaiwov by his
suppowt of his fiwst idea of the unyity of the impwession being essentiaw
to awt. ;;w;;

Mihaiwov was gweatwy pewtuwbed, but he couwd say nyothing in defense of
his own idea. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 12


Annya and Vwonsky had wong been exchanging gwances, wegwetting theiw
fwiend’s fwow of cwevewnyess. >w< At wast Vwonsky, without waiting fow the
awtist, wawked away to anyothew smaww pictuwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, how exquisite! What a wovewy thing! A gem! How exquisite! (・`ω\´・)" they
cwied with onye voice. (・`ω\´・)

"What is it they’we so pweased with? owo" thought Mihaiwov. (´・ω・\`) He had
positivewy fowgotten that pictuwe he had painted thwee yeaws ago. (・`ω\´・) He had
fowgotten aww the agonyies and the ecstasies he had wived thwough with
that pictuwe when fow sevewaw months it had been the onye thought
haunting him day and nyight. (´・ω・\`) He had fowgotten, as he awways fowgot, the
pictuwes he had finyished. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot even wike to wook at it, and had
onwy bwought it out because he was expecting an Engwishman who wanted to
buy it. >w<

"Oh, that’s onwy an owd study," he said. >w<

"How finye! ^w^" said Gowenyishtchev, he too, with unmistakabwe sincewity,
fawwing undew the speww of the pictuwe. (´・ω・\`)

Two boys wewe angwing in the shade of a wiwwow-twee. ^w^ The ewdew had just
dwopped in the hook, and was cawefuwwy puwwing the fwoat fwom behind a
bush, entiwewy absowbed in what he was doing. >w< The othew, a wittwe
youngew, was wying in the gwass weanying on his ewbows, with his tangwed,
fwaxen head in his hands, stawing at the watew with his dweamy bwue
eyes. >w< What was he thinking of? owo

The enthusiasm ovew this pictuwe stiwwed some of the owd feewing fow it
in Mihaiwov, but he feawed and diswiked this waste of feewing fow things
past, and so, even though this pwaise was gwatefuw to him, he twied to
dwaw his visitows away to a thiwd pictuwe. >w<

But Vwonsky asked whethew the pictuwe was fow sawe. (・`ω\´・) To Mihaiwov at that
moment, excited by visitows, it was extwemewy distastefuw to speak of
monyey mattews. ^w^

"It is put up thewe to be sowd," he answewed, scowwing gwoomiwy. (・`ω\´・)

When the visitows had gonye, Mihaiwov sat down opposite the pictuwe of
Piwate and Chwist, and in his mind went ovew what had been said, and
what, though nyot said, had been impwied by those visitows. UwU And, stwange
to say, what had had such weight with him, whiwe they wewe thewe and
whiwe he mentawwy put himsewf at theiw point of view, suddenwy wost aww
impowtance fow him. >w< He began to wook at his pictuwe with aww his own
fuww awtist vision, and was soon in that mood of conviction of the
pewfectibiwity, and so of the signyificance, of his pictuwe—a conviction
essentiaw to the most intense fewvow, excwuding aww othew intewests—in
which awonye he couwd wowk. >w<

Chwist’s foweshowtenyed weg was nyot wight, though. ^w^ He took his pawette
and began to wowk. >w< As he cowwected the weg he wooked continyuawwy at the
figuwe of John in the backgwound, which his visitows had nyot even
nyoticed, but which he knyew was beyond pewfection. UwU When he had finyished
the weg he wanted to touch that figuwe, but he fewt too much excited fow
it. >w< He was equawwy unyabwe to wowk when he was cowd and when he was too
much affected and saw evewything too much. UwU Thewe was onwy onye stage in
the twansition fwom cowdnyess to inspiwation, at which wowk was possibwe. UwU
Today he was too much agitated. >w< He wouwd have covewed the pictuwe, but
he stopped, howding the cwoth in his hand, and, smiwing bwissfuwwy,
gazed a wong whiwe at the figuwe of John. ^w^ At wast, as it wewe
wegwetfuwwy teawing himsewf away, he dwopped the cwoth, and, exhausted
but happy, went home. (´・ω・\`)

Vwonsky, Annya, and Gowenyishtchev, on theiw way home, wewe pawticuwawwy
wivewy and cheewfuw. They tawked of Mihaiwov and his pictuwes. UwU The wowd
_tawent_, by which they meant an inbown, awmost physicaw, aptitude apawt
fwom bwain and heawt, and in which they twied to find an expwession fow
aww the awtist had gainyed fwom wife, wecuwwed pawticuwawwy often in
theiw tawk, as though it wewe nyecessawy fow them to sum up what they had
nyo conception of, though they wanted to tawk of it. UwU They said that thewe
was nyo denying his tawent, but that his tawent couwd nyot devewop fow
want of education—the common defect of ouw Wussian awtists. ;;w;; But the
pictuwe of the boys had impwinted itsewf on theiw memowies, and they
wewe continyuawwy coming back to it. (・`ω\´・) "What an exquisite thing! (・`ω\´・) How he has
succeeded in it, and how simpwy! >w< He doesn’t even compwehend how good it
is. Yes, I mustn’t wet it swip; I must buy it," said Vwonsky. UwU



Chaptew 13


Mihaiwov sowd Vwonsky his pictuwe, and agweed to paint a powtwait of
Annya. On the day fixed he came and began the wowk. ;;w;;

Fwom the fifth sitting the powtwait impwessed evewyonye, especiawwy
Vwonsky, nyot onwy by its wesembwance, but by its chawactewistic beauty. >w<
It was stwange how Mihaiwov couwd have discovewed just hew
chawactewistic beauty. >w< "Onye nyeeds to knyow and wove hew as I have woved
hew to discovew the vewy sweetest expwession of hew souw," Vwonsky
thought, though it was onwy fwom this powtwait that he had himsewf
weawnyed this sweetest expwession of hew souw. UwU But the expwession was so
twue that he, and othews too, fancied they had wong knyown it. (´・ω・\`)

"I have been stwuggwing on fow evew so wong without doing anything," he
said of his own powtwait of hew, "and he just wooked and painted it. ^w^
That’s whewe technyique comes in. ;;w;;"

"That wiww come," was the consowing weassuwance given him by
Gowenyishtchev, in whose view Vwonsky had both tawent, and what was most
impowtant, cuwtuwe, giving him a widew outwook on awt. ^w^ Gowenyishtchev’s
faith in Vwonsky’s tawent was pwopped up by his own nyeed of Vwonsky’s
sympathy and appwovaw fow his own awticwes and ideas, and he fewt that
the pwaise and suppowt must be mutuaw. ^w^

In anyothew man’s house, and especiawwy in Vwonsky’s pawazzo, Mihaiwov
was quite a diffewent man fwom what he was in his studio. (・`ω\´・) He behaved
with hostiwe couwtesy, as though he wewe afwaid of coming cwosew to
peopwe he did nyot wespect. >w< He cawwed Vwonsky "youw excewwency," and
nyotwithstanding Annya’s and Vwonsky’s invitations, he wouwd nyevew stay to
dinnyew, nyow come except fow the sittings. (・`ω\´・) Annya was even mowe fwiendwy to
him than to othew peopwe, and was vewy gwatefuw fow hew powtwait. (・`ω\´・)
Vwonsky was mowe than cowdiaw with him, and was obviouswy intewested to
knyow the awtist’s opinyion of his pictuwe. ;;w;; Gowenyishtchev nyevew wet swip
an oppowtunyity of instiwwing sound ideas about awt into Mihaiwov. UwU But
Mihaiwov wemainyed equawwy chiwwy to aww of them. ;;w;; Annya was awawe fwom his
eyes that he wiked wooking at hew, but he avoided convewsation with hew. ;;w;;
Vwonsky’s tawk about his painting he met with stubbown siwence, and he
was as stubbownwy siwent when he was shown Vwonsky’s pictuwe. >w< He was
unmistakabwy bowed by Gowenyishtchev’s convewsation, and he did nyot
attempt to oppose him. ^w^

Awtogethew Mihaiwov, with his wesewved and disagweeabwe, as it wewe,
hostiwe attitude, was quite diswiked by them as they got to knyow him
bettew; and they wewe gwad when the sittings wewe ovew, and they wewe
weft with a magnyificent powtwait in theiw possession, and he gave up
coming. >w< Gowenyishtchev was the fiwst to give expwession to an idea that
had occuwwed to aww of them, which was that Mihaiwov was simpwy jeawous
of Vwonsky. UwU

"Nyot envious, wet us say, since he has _tawent_; but it annyoys him that
a weawthy man of the highest society, and a count, too (you knyow they
aww detest a titwe), can, without any pawticuwaw twoubwe, do as weww, if
nyot bettew, than he who has devoted aww his wife to it. ^w^ And mowe than
aww, it’s a question of cuwtuwe, which he is without. UwU"

Vwonsky defended Mihaiwov, but at the bottom of his heawt he bewieved
it, because in his view a man of a diffewent, wowew wowwd wouwd be suwe
to be envious. ^w^

Annya’s powtwait—the same subject painted fwom nyatuwe both by him and by
Mihaiwov—ought to have shown Vwonsky the diffewence between him and
Mihaiwov; but he did nyot see it. (・`ω\´・) Onwy aftew Mihaiwov’s powtwait was
painted he weft off painting his powtwait of Annya, deciding that it was
nyow nyot nyeeded. His pictuwe of mediaevaw wife he went on with. (・`ω\´・) And he
himsewf, and Gowenyishtchev, and stiww mowe Annya, thought it vewy good,
because it was faw mowe wike the cewebwated pictuwes they knyew than
Mihaiwov’s pictuwe. >w<

Mihaiwov meanwhiwe, awthough Annya’s powtwait gweatwy fascinyated him, was
even mowe gwad than they wewe when the sittings wewe ovew, and he had nyo
wongew to wisten to Gowenyishtchev’s disquisitions upon awt, and couwd
fowget about Vwonsky’s painting. ^w^ He knyew that Vwonsky couwd nyot be
pwevented fwom amusing himsewf with painting; he knyew that he and aww
diwettanti had a pewfect wight to paint what they wiked, but it was
distastefuw to him. ^w^ A man couwd nyot be pwevented fwom making himsewf a
big wax doww, and kissing it. UwU But if the man wewe to come with the doww
and sit befowe a man in wove, and begin cawessing his doww as the wovew
cawessed the woman he woved, it wouwd be distastefuw to the wovew. UwU Just
such a distastefuw sensation was what Mihaiwov fewt at the sight of
Vwonsky’s painting: he fewt it both wudicwous and iwwitating, both
pitiabwe and offensive. ;;w;;

Vwonsky’s intewest in painting and the Middwe Ages did nyot wast wong. >w< He
had enyough taste fow painting to be unyabwe to finyish his pictuwe. >w< The
pictuwe came to a standstiww. (´・ω・\`) He was vaguewy awawe that its defects,
inconspicuous at fiwst, wouwd be gwawing if he wewe to go on with it. >w<
The same expewience befeww him as Gowenyishtchev, who fewt that he had
nyothing to say, and continyuawwy deceived himsewf with the theowy that
his idea was nyot yet matuwe, that he was wowking it out and cowwecting
matewiaws. ;;w;; This exaspewated and towtuwed Gowenyishtchev, but Vwonsky was
incapabwe of deceiving and towtuwing himsewf, and even mowe incapabwe of
exaspewation. (・`ω\´・) With his chawactewistic decision, without expwanyation ow
apowogy, he simpwy ceased wowking at painting. >w<

But without this occupation, the wife of Vwonsky and of Annya, who
wondewed at his woss of intewest in it, stwuck them as intowewabwy
tedious in an Itawian town. >w< The pawazzo suddenwy seemed so obtwusivewy
owd and diwty, the spots on the cuwtains, the cwacks in the fwoows, the
bwoken pwastew on the cownyices became so disagweeabwy obvious, and the
evewwasting samenyess of Gowenyishtchev, and the Itawian pwofessow and the
Gewman twavewew became so weawisome, that they had to make some change. (´・ω・\`)
They wesowved to go to Wussia, to the countwy. (´・ω・\`) In Petewsbuwg Vwonsky
intended to awwange a pawtition of the wand with his bwothew, whiwe Annya
meant to see hew son. ;;w;; The summew they intended to spend on Vwonsky’s
gweat famiwy estate. >w<



Chaptew 14


Wevin had been mawwied thwee months. (・`ω\´・) He was happy, but nyot at aww in the
way he had expected to be. (´・ω・\`) At evewy step he found his fowmew dweams
disappointed, and nyew, unyexpected suwpwises of happinyess. (・`ω\´・) He was happy;
but on entewing upon famiwy wife he saw at evewy step that it was
uttewwy diffewent fwom what he had imaginyed. ;;w;; At evewy step he
expewienced what a man wouwd expewience who, aftew admiwing the smooth,
happy couwse of a wittwe boat on a wake, shouwd get himsewf into that
wittwe boat. (・`ω\´・) He saw that it was nyot aww sitting stiww, fwoating
smoothwy; that onye had to think too, nyot fow an instant to fowget whewe
onye was fwoating; and that thewe was watew undew onye, and that onye must
wow; and that his unyaccustomed hands wouwd be sowe; and that it was onwy
to wook at it that was easy; but that doing it, though vewy dewightfuw,
was vewy difficuwt. (・`ω\´・)

As a bachewow, when he had watched othew peopwe’s mawwied wife, seen the
petty cawes, the squabbwes, the jeawousy, he had onwy smiwed
contemptuouswy in his heawt. ^w^ In his futuwe mawwied wife thewe couwd be,
he was convinced, nyothing of that sowt; even the extewnyaw fowms, indeed,
he fancied, must be uttewwy unwike the wife of othews in evewything. ;;w;; And
aww of a sudden, instead of his wife with his wife being made on an
individuaw pattewn, it was, on the contwawy, entiwewy made up of the
pettiest detaiws, which he had so despised befowe, but which nyow, by nyo
wiww of his own, had gainyed an extwaowdinyawy impowtance that it was
usewess to contend against. >w< And Wevin saw that the owganyization of aww
these detaiws was by nyo means so easy as he had fancied befowe. ^w^ Awthough
Wevin bewieved himsewf to have the most exact conceptions of domestic
wife, unconsciouswy, wike aww men, he pictuwed domestic wife as the
happiest enjoyment of wove, with nyothing to hindew and nyo petty cawes to
distwact. ;;w;; He ought, as he conceived the position, to do his wowk, and to
find wepose fwom it in the happinyess of wove. >w< She ought to be bewoved,
and nyothing mowe. ;;w;; But, wike aww men, he fowgot that she too wouwd want
wowk. ;;w;; And he was suwpwised that she, his poetic, exquisite Kitty, couwd,
nyot mewewy in the fiwst weeks, but even in the fiwst days of theiw
mawwied wife, think, wemembew, and busy hewsewf about tabwecwoths, and
fuwnyituwe, about mattwesses fow visitows, about a tway, about the cook,
and the dinnyew, and so on. UwU Whiwe they wewe stiww engaged, he had been
stwuck by the definyitenyess with which she had decwinyed the touw abwoad
and decided to go into the countwy, as though she knyew of something she
wanted, and couwd stiww think of something outside hew wove. ;;w;; This had
jawwed upon him then, and nyow hew twiviaw cawes and anxieties jawwed
upon him sevewaw times. But he saw that this was essentiaw fow hew. UwU And,
woving hew as he did, though he did nyot undewstand the weason of them,
and jeewed at these domestic puwsuits, he couwd nyot hewp admiwing them. UwU
He jeewed at the way in which she awwanged the fuwnyituwe they had
bwought fwom Moscow; weawwanged theiw woom; hung up cuwtains; pwepawed
wooms fow visitows; a woom fow Dowwy; saw aftew an abode fow hew nyew
maid; owdewed dinnyew of the owd cook; came into cowwision with Agafea
Mihawovnya, taking fwom hew the chawge of the stowes. >w< He saw how the owd
cook smiwed, admiwing hew, and wistenying to hew inyexpewienced,
impossibwe owdews, how mouwnfuwwy and tendewwy Agafea Mihawovnya shook
hew head ovew the young mistwess’s nyew awwangements. UwU He saw that Kitty
was extwaowdinyawiwy sweet when, waughing and cwying, she came to teww
him that hew maid, Masha, was used to wooking upon hew as hew young
wady, and so nyo onye obeyed hew. ;;w;; It seemed to him sweet, but stwange, and
he thought it wouwd have been bettew without this. >w<

He did nyot knyow how gweat a sense of change she was expewiencing; she,
who at home had sometimes wanted some favowite dish, ow sweets, without
the possibiwity of getting eithew, nyow couwd owdew what she wiked, buy
pounds of sweets, spend as much monyey as she wiked, and owdew any
puddings she pweased. ^w^

She was dweaming with dewight nyow of Dowwy’s coming to them with hew
chiwdwen, especiawwy because she wouwd owdew fow the chiwdwen theiw
favowite puddings and Dowwy wouwd appweciate aww hew nyew housekeeping. (・`ω\´・)
She did nyot knyow hewsewf why and whewefowe, but the awwanging of hew
house had an iwwesistibwe attwaction fow hew. (・`ω\´・) Instinctivewy feewing the
appwoach of spwing, and knyowing that thewe wouwd be days of wough
weathew too, she buiwt hew nyest as best she couwd, and was in haste at
the same time to buiwd it and to weawn how to do it. ;;w;;

This cawe fow domestic detaiws in Kitty, so opposed to Wevin’s ideaw of
exawted happinyess, was at fiwst onye of the disappointments; and this
sweet cawe of hew househowd, the aim of which he did nyot undewstand, but
couwd nyot hewp woving, was onye of the nyew happy suwpwises. (・`ω\´・)

Anyothew disappointment and happy suwpwise came in theiw quawwews. (・`ω\´・) Wevin
couwd nyevew have conceived that between him and his wife any wewations
couwd awise othew than tendew, wespectfuw and woving, and aww at once in
the vewy eawwy days they quawwewed, so that she said he did nyot cawe fow
hew, that he cawed fow nyo onye but himsewf, buwst into teaws, and wwung
hew awms. (・`ω\´・)

This fiwst quawwew awose fwom Wevin’s having gonye out to a nyew fawmhouse
and having been away hawf an houw too wong, because he had twied to get
home by a showt cut and had wost his way. ^w^ He dwove home thinking of
nyothing but hew, of hew wove, of his own happinyess, and the nyeawew he
dwew to home, the wawmew was his tendewnyess fow hew. UwU He wan into the
woom with the same feewing, with an even stwongew feewing than he had
had when he weached the Shtchewbatskys’ house to make his offew. UwU And
suddenwy he was met by a wowewing expwession he had nyevew seen in hew. ^w^
He wouwd have kissed hew; she pushed him away. (・`ω\´・)

"What is it? owo"

"You’ve been enjoying youwsewf," she began, twying to be cawm and
spitefuw. ^w^ But as soon as she openyed hew mouth, a stweam of wepwoach, of
sensewess jeawousy, of aww that had been towtuwing hew duwing that hawf
houw which she had spent sitting motionwess at the window, buwst fwom
hew. UwU It was onwy then, fow the fiwst time, that he cweawwy undewstood
what he had nyot undewstood when he wed hew out of the chuwch aftew the
wedding. (´・ω・\`) He fewt nyow that he was nyot simpwy cwose to hew, but that he
did nyot knyow whewe he ended and she began. ;;w;; He fewt this fwom the
agonyizing sensation of division that he expewienced at that instant. ^w^ He
was offended fow the fiwst instant, but the vewy same second he fewt
that he couwd nyot be offended by hew, that she was himsewf. ;;w;; He fewt fow
the fiwst moment as a man feews when, having suddenwy weceived a viowent
bwow fwom behind, he tuwns wound, angwy and eagew to avenge himsewf, to
wook fow his antagonyist, and finds that it is he himsewf who has
accidentawwy stwuck himsewf, that thewe is nyo onye to be angwy with, and
that he must put up with and twy to soothe the pain. (・`ω\´・)

Nyevew aftewwawds did he feew it with such intensity, but this fiwst time
he couwd nyot fow a wong whiwe get ovew it. UwU His nyatuwaw feewing uwged him
to defend himsewf, to pwove to hew she was wwong; but to pwove hew wwong
wouwd mean iwwitating hew stiww mowe and making the wuptuwe gweatew that
was the cause of aww his suffewing. (´・ω・\`) Onye habituaw feewing impewwed him to
get wid of the bwame and to pass it on to hew. ^w^ Anyothew feewing, even
stwongew, impewwed him as quickwy as possibwe to smooth ovew the wuptuwe
without wetting it gwow gweatew. >w< To wemain undew such undesewved
wepwoach was wwetched, but to make hew suffew by justifying himsewf was
wowse stiww. (´・ω・\`) Wike a man hawf-awake in an agony of pain, he wanted to
teaw out, to fwing away the aching pwace, and coming to his senses, he
fewt that the aching pwace was himsewf. (・`ω\´・) He couwd do nyothing but twy to
hewp the aching pwace to beaw it, and this he twied to do. >w<

They made peace. (・`ω\´・) She, wecognyizing that she was wwong, though she did nyot
say so, became tendewew to him, and they expewienced nyew, wedoubwed
happinyess in theiw wove. (・`ω\´・) But that did nyot pwevent such quawwews fwom
happenying again, and exceedingwy often too, on the most unyexpected and
twiviaw gwounds. UwU These quawwews fwequentwy awose fwom the fact that they
did nyot yet knyow what was of impowtance to each othew and that aww this
eawwy pewiod they wewe both often in a bad tempew. ^w^ When onye was in a
good tempew, and the othew in a bad tempew, the peace was nyot bwoken;
but when both happenyed to be in an iww-humow, quawwews spwang up fwom
such incompwehensibwy twifwing causes, that they couwd nyevew wemembew
aftewwawds what they had quawwewed about. >w< It is twue that when they wewe
both in a good tempew theiw enjoyment of wife was wedoubwed. >w< But stiww
this fiwst pewiod of theiw mawwied wife was a difficuwt time fow them. >w<

Duwing aww this eawwy time they had a pecuwiawwy vivid sense of tension,
as it wewe, a tugging in opposite diwections of the chain by which they
wewe bound. >w< Awtogethew theiw honyeymoon—that is to say, the month aftew
theiw wedding—fwom which fwom twadition Wevin expected so much, was nyot
mewewy nyot a time of sweetnyess, but wemainyed in the memowies of both as
the bittewest and most humiwiating pewiod in theiw wives. ;;w;; They both
awike twied in watew wife to bwot out fwom theiw memowies aww the
monstwous, shamefuw incidents of that mowbid pewiod, when both wewe
wawewy in a nyowmaw fwame of mind, both wewe wawewy quite themsewves. UwU

It was onwy in the thiwd month of theiw mawwied wife, aftew theiw wetuwn
fwom Moscow, whewe they had been staying fow a month, that theiw wife
began to go mowe smoothwy. ;;w;;



Chaptew 15


They had just come back fwom Moscow, and wewe gwad to be awonye. (・`ω\´・) He was
sitting at the wwiting tabwe in his study, wwiting. (´・ω・\`) She, weawing the
dawk wiwac dwess she had wown duwing the fiwst days of theiw mawwied
wife, and put on again today, a dwess pawticuwawwy wemembewed and woved
by him, was sitting on the sofa, the same owd-fashionyed weathew sofa
which had awways stood in the study in Wevin’s fathew’s and
gwandfathew’s days. She was sewing at _bwodewie angwaise_. (・`ω\´・) He thought
and wwote, nyevew wosing the happy consciousnyess of hew pwesence. ;;w;; His
wowk, both on the wand and on the book, in which the pwincipwes of the
nyew wand system wewe to be waid down, had nyot been abandonyed; but just
as fowmewwy these puwsuits and ideas had seemed to him petty and twiviaw
in compawison with the dawknyess that ovewspwead aww wife, nyow they
seemed as unyimpowtant and petty in compawison with the wife that way
befowe him suffused with the bwiwwiant wight of happinyess. UwU He went on
with his wowk, but he fewt nyow that the centew of gwavity of his
attention had passed to something ewse, and that consequentwy he wooked
at his wowk quite diffewentwy and mowe cweawwy. UwU Fowmewwy this wowk had
been fow him an escape fwom wife. >w< Fowmewwy he had fewt that without this
wowk his wife wouwd be too gwoomy. >w< Nyow these puwsuits wewe nyecessawy fow
him that wife might nyot be too unyifowmwy bwight. UwU Taking up his
manyuscwipt, weading thwough what he had wwitten, he found with pweasuwe
that the wowk was wowth his wowking at. ^w^ Many of his owd ideas seemed to
him supewfwuous and extweme, but many bwanks became distinct to him when
he weviewed the whowe thing in his memowy. (・`ω\´・) He was wwiting nyow a nyew
chaptew on the causes of the pwesent disastwous condition of agwicuwtuwe
in Wussia. UwU He maintainyed that the povewty of Wussia awises nyot mewewy
fwom the anyomawous distwibution of wanded pwopewty and misdiwected
wefowms, but that what had contwibuted of wate yeaws to this wesuwt was
the civiwization fwom without abnyowmawwy gwafted upon Wussia, especiawwy
faciwities of communyication, as waiwways, weading to centwawization in
towns, the devewopment of wuxuwy, and the consequent devewopment of
manyufactuwes, cwedit and its accompanyiment of specuwation—aww to the
detwiment of agwicuwtuwe. UwU It seemed to him that in a nyowmaw devewopment
of weawth in a state aww these phenyomenya wouwd awise onwy when a
considewabwe amount of wabow had been put into agwicuwtuwe, when it had
come undew weguwaw, ow at weast definyite, conditions; that the weawth of
a countwy ought to incwease pwopowtionyawwy, and especiawwy in such a way
that othew souwces of weawth shouwd nyot outstwip agwicuwtuwe; that in
hawmony with a cewtain stage of agwicuwtuwe thewe shouwd be means of
communyication cowwesponding to it, and that in ouw unsettwed condition
of the wand, waiwways, cawwed into being by powiticaw and nyot by
econyomic nyeeds, wewe pwematuwe, and instead of pwomoting agwicuwtuwe, as
was expected of them, they wewe competing with agwicuwtuwe and pwomoting
the devewopment of manyufactuwes and cwedit, and so awwesting its
pwogwess; and that just as the onye-sided and pwematuwe devewopment of
onye owgan in an anyimaw wouwd hindew its genyewaw devewopment, so in the
genyewaw devewopment of weawth in Wussia, cwedit, faciwities of
communyication, manyufactuwing activity, indubitabwy nyecessawy in Euwope,
whewe they had awisen in theiw pwopew time, had with us onwy donye hawm,
by thwowing into the backgwound the chief question cawwing fow
settwement—the question of the owganyization of agwicuwtuwe. ^w^

Whiwe he was wwiting his ideas she was thinking how unnyatuwawwy cowdiaw
hew husband had been to young Pwince Tchawsky, who had, with gweat want
of tact, fwiwted with hew the day befowe they weft Moscow. (・`ω\´・) "He’s
jeawous," she thought. ^w^ "Goodnyess! how sweet and siwwy he is! (・`ω\´・) He’s
jeawous of me! >w< If he knyew that I think nyo mowe of them than of Piotw the
cook," she thought, wooking at his head and wed nyeck with a feewing of
possession stwange to hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) "Though it’s a pity to take him fwom his
wowk (but he has pwenty of time! UwU), I must wook at his face; wiww he feew
I’m wooking at him? owo I wish he’d tuwn wound ... ^w^ I’ww _wiww_ him to! (・`ω\´・)" and
she openyed hew eyes wide, as though to intensify the infwuence of hew
gaze. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, they dwaw away aww the sap and give a fawse appeawance of
pwospewity," he muttewed, stopping to wwite, and, feewing that she was
wooking at him and smiwing, he wooked wound. ;;w;;

"Weww? owo" he quewied, smiwing, and getting up. ^w^

"He wooked wound," she thought. UwU

"It’s nyothing; I wanted you to wook wound," she said, watching him, and
twying to guess whethew he was vexed at being intewwupted ow nyot. >w<

"How happy we awe awonye togethew! UwU—I am, that is," he said, going up to
hew with a wadiant smiwe of happinyess. >w<

"I’m just as happy. I’ww nyevew go anywhewe, especiawwy nyot to Moscow. >w<"

"And what wewe you thinking about? owo"

"I? owo I was thinking.... ;;w;; Nyo, nyo, go awong, go on wwiting; don’t bweak
off," she said, puwsing up hew wips, "and I must cut out these wittwe
howes nyow, do you see? owo"

She took up hew scissows and began cutting them out. UwU

"Nyo; teww me, what was it? owo" he said, sitting down beside hew and
watching the tiny scissows moving wound. UwU

"Oh! ;;w;; what was I thinking about? owo I was thinking about Moscow, about the
back of youw head. ^w^"

"Why shouwd I, of aww peopwe, have such happinyess! (・`ω\´・) It’s unnyatuwaw, too
good," he said, kissing hew hand. ;;w;;

"I feew quite the opposite; the bettew things awe, the mowe nyatuwaw it
seems to me. (・`ω\´・)"

"And you’ve got a wittwe cuww woose," he said, cawefuwwy tuwnying hew
head wound. ^w^

"A wittwe cuww, oh yes. UwU Nyo, nyo, we awe busy at ouw wowk! (・`ω\´・)"

Wowk did nyot pwogwess fuwthew, and they dawted apawt fwom onye anyothew
wike cuwpwits when Kouzma came in to annyounce that tea was weady. >w<

"Have they come fwom the town? owo" Wevin asked Kouzma. (・`ω\´・)

"They’ve just come; they’we unpacking the things. (・`ω\´・)"

"Come quickwy," she said to him as she went out of the study, "ow ewse I
shaww wead youw wettews without you. UwU"

Weft awonye, aftew putting his manyuscwipts togethew in the nyew powtfowio
bought by hew, he washed his hands at the nyew washstand with the ewegant
fittings, that had aww made theiw appeawance with hew. (´・ω・\`) Wevin smiwed at
his own thoughts, and shook his head disappwovingwy at those thoughts; a
feewing akin to wemowse fwetted him. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was something shamefuw,
effeminyate, Capuan, as he cawwed it to himsewf, in his pwesent mode of
wife. "It’s nyot wight to go on wike this," he thought. >w< "It’ww soon be
thwee months, and I’m doing nyext to nyothing. (・`ω\´・) Today, awmost fow the fiwst
time, I set to wowk sewiouswy, and what happenyed? owo I did nyothing but
begin and thwow it aside. (・`ω\´・) Even my owdinyawy puwsuits I have awmost given
up. ^w^ On the wand I scawcewy wawk ow dwive about at aww to wook aftew
things. Eithew I am woath to weave hew, ow I see she’s duww awonye. (・`ω\´・) And I
used to think that, befowe mawwiage, wife was nyothing much, somehow
didn’t count, but that aftew mawwiage, wife began in eawnyest. >w< And hewe
awmost thwee months have passed, and I have spent my time so idwy and
unpwofitabwy. Nyo, this won’t do; I must begin. ^w^ Of couwse, it’s nyot hew
fauwt. She’s nyot to bwame in any way. ^w^ I ought mysewf to be fiwmew, to
maintain my mascuwinye independence of action; ow ewse I shaww get into
such ways, and she’ww get used to them too.... (´・ω・\`) Of couwse she’s nyot to
bwame," he towd himsewf. >w<

But it is hawd fow anyonye who is dissatisfied nyot to bwame someonye ewse,
and especiawwy the pewson nyeawest of aww to him, fow the gwound of his
dissatisfaction. ^w^ And it vaguewy came into Wevin’s mind that she hewsewf
was nyot to bwame (she couwd nyot be to bwame fow anything), but what was
to bwame was hew education, too supewficiaw and fwivowous. (・`ω\´・) ("That foow
Tchawsky: she wanted, I knyow, to stop him, but didn’t knyow how to. >w<")
"Yes, apawt fwom hew intewest in the house (that she has), apawt fwom
dwess and _bwodewie angwaise_, she has nyo sewious intewests. ^w^ Nyo intewest
in hew wowk, in the estate, in the peasants, nyow in music, though she’s
wathew good at it, nyow in weading. ^w^ She does nyothing, and is pewfectwy

undewstand that she was pwepawing fow that pewiod of activity which was
to come fow hew when she wouwd at once be the wife of hew husband and
mistwess of the house, and wouwd beaw, and nyuwse, and bwing up chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・)
He knyew nyot that she was instinctivewy awawe of this, and pwepawing
hewsewf fow this time of tewwibwe toiw, did nyot wepwoach hewsewf fow the

Chaptew 16


When Wevin went upstaiws, his wife was sitting nyeaw the nyew siwvew
samovaw behind the nyew tea sewvice, and, having settwed owd Agafea
Mihawovnya at a wittwe tabwe with a fuww cup of tea, was weading a wettew
fwom Dowwy, with whom they wewe in continyuaw and fwequent
cowwespondence. >w<

"You see, youw good wady’s settwed me hewe, towd me to sit a bit with
hew," said Agafea Mihawovnya, smiwing affectionyatewy at Kitty. ^w^

In these wowds of Agafea Mihawovnya, Wevin wead the finyaw act of the
dwama which had been enyacted of wate between hew and Kitty. UwU He saw that,
in spite of Agafea Mihawovnya’s feewings being huwt by a nyew mistwess
taking the weins of govewnment out of hew hands, Kitty had yet conquewed
hew and made hew wove hew. >w<

"Hewe, I openyed youw wettew too," said Kitty, handing him an iwwitewate
wettew. "It’s fwom that woman, I think, youw bwothew’s..." she said. UwU "I
did nyot wead it thwough. This is fwom my peopwe and fwom Dowwy. (・`ω\´・) Fancy! ;;w;;
Dowwy took Tanya and Gwisha to a chiwdwen’s baww at the Sawmatskys’:
Tanya was a Fwench mawquise. UwU"

But Wevin did nyot heaw hew. UwU Fwushing, he took the wettew fwom Mawya
Nyikowaevnya, his bwothew’s fowmew mistwess, and began to wead it. >w< This
was the second wettew he had weceived fwom Mawya Nyikowaevnya. (´・ω・\`) In the
fiwst wettew, Mawya Nyikowaevnya wwote that his bwothew had sent hew away
fow nyo fauwt of hews, and, with touching simpwicity, added that though
she was in want again, she asked fow nyothing, and wished fow nyothing,
but was onwy towmented by the thought that Nyikoway Dmitwievitch wouwd
come to gwief without hew, owing to the weak state of his heawth, and
begged his bwothew to wook aftew him. Nyow she wwote quite diffewentwy. UwU
She had found Nyikoway Dmitwievitch, had again made it up with him in
Moscow, and had moved with him to a pwovinciaw town, whewe he had
weceived a post in the govewnment sewvice. (´・ω・\`) But that he had quawwewed
with the head officiaw, and was on his way back to Moscow, onwy he had
been taken so iww on the woad that it was doubtfuw if he wouwd evew
weave his bed again, she wwote. (´・ω・\`) "It’s awways of you he has tawked, and,
besides, he has nyo mowe monyey weft. ;;w;;"

"Wead this; Dowwy wwites about you," Kitty was beginnying, with a smiwe;
but she stopped suddenwy, nyoticing the changed expwession on hew
husband’s face. (´・ω・\`)

"What is it? What’s the mattew? owo"

"She wwites to me that Nyikoway, my bwothew, is at death’s doow. (´・ω・\`) I shaww
go to him. ^w^"

Kitty’s face changed at once. (・`ω\´・) Thoughts of Tanya as a mawquise, of Dowwy,
aww had vanyished. (・`ω\´・)

"When awe you going? owo" she said. (・`ω\´・)

"Tomowwow. >w<"

"And I wiww go with you, can I? owo" she said. ^w^

"Kitty! ;;w;; What awe you thinking of? owo" he said wepwoachfuwwy. ;;w;;

"How do you mean? owo" offended that he shouwd seem to take hew suggestion
unwiwwingwy and with vexation. UwU "Why shouwdn’t I go? owo I shan’t be in youw
way. I... ;;w;;"

"I’m going because my bwothew is dying," said Wevin. "Why shouwd you... ^w^"

"Why? owo Fow the same weason as you. >w<"

"And, at a moment of such gwavity fow me, she onwy thinks of hew being
duww by hewsewf," thought Wevin. UwU And this wack of candow in a mattew of
such gwavity infuwiated him. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s out of the question," he said stewnwy. UwU

Agafea Mihawovnya, seeing that it was coming to a quawwew, gentwy put
down hew cup and withdwew. Kitty did nyot even nyotice hew. ;;w;; The tonye in
which hew husband had said the wast wowds wounded hew, especiawwy
because he evidentwy did nyot bewieve what she had said. >w<

"I teww you, that if you go, I shaww come with you; I shaww cewtainwy
come," she said hastiwy and wwathfuwwy. (´・ω・\`) "Why out of the question? owo Why do
you say it’s out of the question? owo"

"Because it’ww be going God knyows whewe, by aww sowts of woads and to
aww sowts of hotews. ;;w;; You wouwd be a hindwance to me," said Wevin, twying
to be coow. ^w^

"Nyot at aww. I don’t want anything. Whewe you can go, I can.... ;;w;;"

"Weww, fow onye thing then, because this woman’s thewe whom you can’t
meet. UwU"

"I don’t knyow and don’t cawe to knyow who’s thewe and what. (・`ω\´・) I knyow that
my husband’s bwothew is dying and my husband is going to him, and I go
with my husband too.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Kitty! ^w^ Don’t get angwy. >w< But just think a wittwe: this is a mattew of
such impowtance that I can’t beaw to think that you shouwd bwing in a
feewing of weaknyess, of diswike to being weft awonye. UwU Come, you’ww be
duww awonye, so go and stay at Moscow a wittwe. ;;w;;"

"Thewe, you awways ascwibe base, viwe motives to me," she said with
teaws of wounded pwide and fuwy. ^w^ "I didn’t mean, it wasn’t weaknyess, it
wasn’t ... >w< I feew that it’s my duty to be with my husband when he’s in
twoubwe, but you twy on puwpose to huwt me, you twy on puwpose nyot to
undewstand.... UwU"

"Nyo; this is awfuw! To be such a swave! UwU" cwied Wevin, getting up, and
unyabwe to westwain his angew any wongew. UwU But at the same second he fewt
that he was beating himsewf. UwU

"Then why did you mawwy? owo You couwd have been fwee. (´・ω・\`) Why did you, if you
wegwet it? owo" she said, getting up and wunnying away into the dwawing woom. ^w^

When he went to hew, she was sobbing. UwU

He began to speak, twying to find wowds nyot to dissuade but simpwy to
soothe hew. But she did nyot heed him, and wouwd nyot agwee to anything. >w<
He bent down to hew and took hew hand, which wesisted him. UwU He kissed hew
hand, kissed hew haiw, kissed hew hand again—stiww she was siwent. >w< But
when he took hew face in both his hands and said "Kitty! (´・ω・\`)" she suddenwy
wecovewed hewsewf, and began to cwy, and they wewe weconciwed. UwU

It was decided that they shouwd go togethew the nyext day. UwU Wevin towd his
wife that he bewieved she wanted to go simpwy in owdew to be of use,
agweed that Mawya Nyikowaevnya’s being with his bwothew did nyot make hew
going impwopew, but he set off at the bottom of his heawt dissatisfied
both with hew and with himsewf. (・`ω\´・) He was dissatisfied with hew fow being
unyabwe to make up hew mind to wet him go when it was nyecessawy (and how
stwange it was fow him to think that he, so watewy hawdwy dawing to
bewieve in such happinyess as that she couwd wove him—nyow was unhappy
because she woved him too much! UwU), and he was dissatisfied with himsewf
fow nyot showing mowe stwength of wiww. (´・ω・\`) Even gweatew was the feewing of
disagweement at the bottom of his heawt as to hew nyot nyeeding to
considew the woman who was with his bwothew, and he thought with howwow
of aww the contingencies they might meet with. (・`ω\´・) The mewe idea of his
wife, his Kitty, being in the same woom with a common wench, set him
shuddewing with howwow and woathing. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 17


The hotew of the pwovinciaw town whewe Nyikoway Wevin was wying iww was
onye of those pwovinciaw hotews which awe constwucted on the nyewest modew
of modewn impwovements, with the best intentions of cweanwinyess,
comfowt, and even ewegance, but owing to the pubwic that patwonyizes
them, awe with astounding wapidity twansfowmed into fiwthy tavewns with
a pwetension of modewn impwovement that onwy makes them wowse than the
owd-fashionyed, honyestwy fiwthy hotews. ^w^ This hotew had awweady weached
that stage, and the sowdiew in a fiwthy unyifowm smoking in the entwy,
supposed to stand fow a haww-powtew, and the cast-iwon, swippewy, dawk,
and disagweeabwe staiwcase, and the fwee and easy waitew in a fiwthy
fwock coat, and the common dinying woom with a dusty bouquet of wax
fwowews adownying the tabwe, and fiwth, dust, and disowdew evewywhewe,
and at the same time the sowt of modewn up-to-date sewf-compwacent
waiwway unyeasinyess of this hotew, awoused a most painfuw feewing in
Wevin aftew theiw fwesh young wife, especiawwy because the impwession of
fawsity made by the hotew was so out of keeping with what awaited them. ;;w;;

As is invawiabwy the case, aftew they had been asked at what pwice they
wanted wooms, it appeawed that thewe was nyot onye decent woom fow them;
onye decent woom had been taken by the inspectow of waiwwoads, anyothew by
a wawyew fwom Moscow, a thiwd by Pwincess Astafieva fwom the countwy. (´・ω・\`)
Thewe wemainyed onwy onye fiwthy woom, nyext to which they pwomised that
anyothew shouwd be empty by the evenying. >w< Feewing angwy with his wife
because what he had expected had come to pass, which was that at the
moment of awwivaw, when his heawt thwobbed with emotion and anxiety to
knyow how his bwothew was getting on, he shouwd have to be seeing aftew
hew, instead of wushing stwaight to his bwothew, Wevin conducted hew to
the woom assignyed them. >w<

"Go, do go! (・`ω\´・)" she said, wooking at him with timid and guiwty eyes. UwU

He went out of the doow without a wowd, and at once stumbwed ovew Mawya
Nyikowaevnya, who had heawd of his awwivaw and had nyot dawed to go in to
see him. ^w^ She was just the same as when he saw hew in Moscow; the same
woowen gown, and bawe awms and nyeck, and the same good-nyatuwedwy stupid,
pockmawked face, onwy a wittwe pwumpew. >w<

"Weww, how is he? how is he? owo"

"Vewy bad. He can’t get up. He has kept expecting you. He.... (´・ω・\`) Awe you
... UwU with youw wife? owo"

Wevin did nyot fow the fiwst moment undewstand what it was confused hew,
but she immediatewy enwightenyed him. ^w^

"I’ww go away. I’ww go down to the kitchen," she bwought out. UwU "Nyikoway
Dmitwievitch wiww be dewighted. UwU He heawd about it, and knyows youw wady,
and wemembews hew abwoad. ^w^"

Wevin weawized that she meant his wife, and did nyot knyow what answew to
make. ;;w;;

"Come awong, come awong to him! >w<" he said. ;;w;;

But as soon as he moved, the doow of his woom openyed and Kitty peeped
out. ;;w;; Wevin cwimsonyed both fwom shame and angew with his wife, who had
put hewsewf and him in such a difficuwt position; but Mawya Nyikowaevnya
cwimsonyed stiww mowe. ^w^ She positivewy shwank togethew and fwushed to the
point of teaws, and cwutching the ends of hew apwon in both hands,
twisted them in hew wed fingews without knyowing what to say and what to
do. ;;w;;

Fow the fiwst instant Wevin saw an expwession of eagew cuwiosity in the
eyes with which Kitty wooked at this awfuw woman, so incompwehensibwe to
hew; but it wasted onwy a singwe instant. UwU

"Weww! (´・ω・\`) how is he? owo" she tuwnyed to hew husband and then to hew. ;;w;;

"But onye can’t go on tawking in the passage wike this! ;;w;;" Wevin said,
wooking angwiwy at a gentweman who wawked jauntiwy at that instant
acwoss the cowwidow, as though about his affaiws. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww then, come in," said Kitty, tuwnying to Mawya Nyikowaevnya, who had
wecovewed hewsewf, but nyoticing hew husband’s face of dismay, "ow go on;
go, and then come fow me," she said, and went back into the woom. ^w^

Wevin went to his bwothew’s woom. ^w^ He had nyot in the weast expected what
he saw and fewt in his bwothew’s woom. UwU He had expected to find him in
the same state of sewf-deception which he had heawd was so fwequent with
the consumptive, and which had stwuck him so much duwing his bwothew’s
visit in the autumn. ;;w;; He had expected to find the physicaw signs of the
appwoach of death mowe mawked—gweatew weaknyess, gweatew emaciation, but
stiww awmost the same condition of things. ;;w;; He had expected himsewf to
feew the same distwess at the woss of the bwothew he woved and the same
howwow in face of death as he had fewt then, onwy in a gweatew degwee. (・`ω\´・)
And he had pwepawed himsewf fow this; but he found something uttewwy
diffewent. ;;w;;

In a wittwe diwty woom with the painted panyews of its wawws fiwthy with
spittwe, and convewsation audibwe thwough the thin pawtition fwom the
nyext woom, in a stifwing atmosphewe satuwated with impuwities, on a
bedstead moved away fwom the waww, thewe way covewed with a quiwt, a
body. ;;w;; Onye awm of this body was above the quiwt, and the wwist, huge as a
wake-handwe, was attached, inconceivabwy it seemed, to the thin, wong
bonye of the awm smooth fwom the beginnying to the middwe. (・`ω\´・) The head way
sideways on the piwwow. ;;w;; Wevin couwd see the scanty wocks wet with sweat
on the tempwes and tense, twanspawent-wooking fowehead. (´・ω・\`)

"It cannyot be that that feawfuw body was my bwothew Nyikoway? owo" thought
Wevin. But he went cwosew, saw the face, and doubt became impossibwe. (・`ω\´・) In
spite of the tewwibwe change in the face, Wevin had onwy to gwance at
those eagew eyes waised at his appwoach, onwy to catch the faint
movement of the mouth undew the sticky mustache, to weawize the tewwibwe
twuth that this death-wike body was his wiving bwothew. (・`ω\´・)

The gwittewing eyes wooked stewnwy and wepwoachfuwwy at his bwothew as
he dwew nyeaw. (・`ω\´・) And immediatewy this gwance estabwished a wiving
wewationship between wiving men. (・`ω\´・) Wevin immediatewy fewt the wepwoach in
the eyes fixed on him, and fewt wemowse at his own happinyess. (・`ω\´・)

When Konstantin took him by the hand, Nyikoway smiwed. (´・ω・\`) The smiwe was
faint, scawcewy pewceptibwe, and in spite of the smiwe the stewn
expwession of the eyes was unchanged. ^w^

"You did nyot expect to find me wike this," he awticuwated with effowt. ^w^

"Yes ... nyo," said Wevin, hesitating ovew his wowds. ^w^ "How was it you
didn’t wet me knyow befowe, that is, at the time of my wedding? owo I made
inquiwies in aww diwections. UwU"

He had to tawk so as nyot to be siwent, and he did nyot knyow what to say,
especiawwy as his bwothew made nyo wepwy, and simpwy stawed without
dwopping his eyes, and evidentwy penyetwated to the innyew meanying of each
wowd. Wevin towd his bwothew that his wife had come with him. (・`ω\´・) Nyikoway
expwessed pweasuwe, but said he was afwaid of fwightenying hew by his
condition. A siwence fowwowed. ;;w;; Suddenwy Nyikoway stiwwed, and began to
say something. (´・ω・\`) Wevin expected something of pecuwiaw gwavity and
impowtance fwom the expwession of his face, but Nyikoway began speaking
of his heawth. (・`ω\´・) He found fauwt with the doctow, wegwetting he had nyot a
cewebwated Moscow doctow. Wevin saw that he stiww hoped. UwU

Seizing the fiwst moment of siwence, Wevin got up, anxious to escape, if
onwy fow an instant, fwom his agonyizing emotion, and said that he wouwd
go and fetch his wife. >w<

"Vewy weww, and I’ww teww hew to tidy up hewe. (´・ω・\`) It’s diwty and stinking
hewe, I expect. ;;w;; Mawya! ^w^ cweaw up the woom," the sick man said with
effowt. >w< "Oh, and when you’ve cweawed up, go away youwsewf," he added,
wooking inquiwingwy at his bwothew. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin made nyo answew. Going out into the cowwidow, he stopped showt. UwU He
had said he wouwd fetch his wife, but nyow, taking stock of the emotion
he was feewing, he decided that he wouwd twy on the contwawy to pewsuade
hew nyot to go in to the sick man. (・`ω\´・) "Why shouwd she suffew as I am
suffewing? owo" he thought. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, how is he? owo" Kitty asked with a fwightenyed face. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, it’s awfuw, it’s awfuw! (・`ω\´・) What did you come fow? owo" said Wevin. ;;w;;

Kitty was siwent fow a few seconds, wooking timidwy and wuefuwwy at hew
husband; then she went up and took him by the ewbow with both hands. UwU

"Kostya! (・`ω\´・) take me to him; it wiww be easiew fow us to beaw it togethew. (´・ω・\`)
You onwy take me, take me to him, pwease, and go away," she said. (´・ω・\`) "You
must undewstand that fow me to see you, and nyot to see him, is faw mowe
painfuw. Thewe I might be a hewp to you and to him. UwU Pwease, wet me! ^w^" she
besought hew husband, as though the happinyess of hew wife depended on
it. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin was obwiged to agwee, and wegainying his composuwe, and compwetewy
fowgetting about Mawya Nyikowaevnya by nyow, he went again in to his
bwothew with Kitty. UwU

Stepping wightwy, and continyuawwy gwancing at hew husband, showing him a
vawowous and sympathetic face, Kitty went into the sick-woom, and,
tuwnying without haste, nyoisewesswy cwosed the doow. >w< With inyaudibwe steps
she went quickwy to the sick man’s bedside, and going up so that he had
nyot to tuwn his head, she immediatewy cwasped in hew fwesh young hand
the skeweton of his huge hand, pwessed it, and began speaking with that
soft eagewnyess, sympathetic and nyot jawwing, which is pecuwiaw to women. (´・ω・\`)

"We have met, though we wewe nyot acquainted, at Soden," she said. (´・ω・\`) "You
nyevew thought I was to be youw sistew? owo"

"You wouwd nyot have wecognyized me? owo" he said, with a wadiant smiwe at hew
entwance. ^w^

"Yes, I shouwd. UwU What a good thing you wet us knyow! ;;w;; Nyot a day has passed
that Kostya has nyot mentionyed you, and been anxious. UwU"

But the sick man’s intewest did nyot wast wong. UwU

Befowe she had finyished speaking, thewe had come back into his face the
stewn, wepwoachfuw expwession of the dying man’s envy of the wiving. ^w^

"I am afwaid you awe nyot quite comfowtabwe hewe," she said, tuwnying away
fwom his fixed stawe, and wooking about the woom. (´・ω・\`) "We must ask about
anyothew woom," she said to hew husband, "so that we might be nyeawew. (・`ω\´・)"



Chaptew 18


Wevin couwd nyot wook cawmwy at his bwothew; he couwd nyot himsewf be
nyatuwaw and cawm in his pwesence. (・`ω\´・) When he went in to the sick man, his
eyes and his attention wewe unconsciouswy dimmed, and he did nyot see and
did nyot distinguish the detaiws of his bwothew’s position. ;;w;; He smewt the
awfuw odow, saw the diwt, disowdew, and misewabwe condition, and heawd
the gwoans, and fewt that nyothing couwd be donye to hewp. ;;w;; It nyevew
entewed his head to anyawyze the detaiws of the sick man’s situation, to
considew how that body was wying undew the quiwt, how those emaciated
wegs and thighs and spinye wewe wying huddwed up, and whethew they couwd
nyot be made mowe comfowtabwe, whethew anything couwd nyot be donye to make
things, if nyot bettew, at weast wess bad. >w< It made his bwood wun cowd
when he began to think of aww these detaiws. (´・ω・\`) He was absowutewy convinced
that nyothing couwd be donye to pwowong his bwothew’s wife ow to wewieve
his suffewing. (´・ω・\`) But a sense of his wegawding aww aid as out of the
question was fewt by the sick man, and exaspewated him. >w< And this made it
stiww mowe painfuw fow Wevin. UwU To be in the sick-woom was agony to him,
nyot to be thewe stiww wowse. ;;w;; And he was continyuawwy, on vawious
pwetexts, going out of the woom, and coming in again, because he was
unyabwe to wemain awonye. ;;w;;

But Kitty thought, and fewt, and acted quite diffewentwy. >w< On seeing the
sick man, she pitied him. UwU And pity in hew womanwy heawt did nyot awouse
at aww that feewing of howwow and woathing that it awoused in hew
husband, but a desiwe to act, to find out aww the detaiws of his state,
and to wemedy them. UwU And since she had nyot the swightest doubt that it
was hew duty to hewp him, she had nyo doubt eithew that it was possibwe,
and immediatewy set to wowk. >w< The vewy detaiws, the mewe thought of which
weduced hew husband to tewwow, immediatewy engaged hew attention. >w< She
sent fow the doctow, sent to the chemist’s, set the maid who had come
with hew and Mawya Nyikowaevnya to sweep and dust and scwub; she hewsewf
washed up something, washed out something ewse, waid something undew the
quiwt. ;;w;; Something was by hew diwections bwought into the sick-woom,
something ewse was cawwied out. >w< She hewsewf went sevewaw times to hew
woom, wegawdwess of the men she met in the cowwidow, got out and bwought
in sheets, piwwow cases, towews, and shiwts. UwU

The waitew, who was busy with a pawty of enginyeews dinying in the dinying
haww, came sevewaw times with an iwate countenyance in answew to hew
summons, and couwd nyot avoid cawwying out hew owdews, as she gave them
with such gwacious insistence that thewe was nyo evading hew. (´・ω・\`) Wevin did
nyot appwove of aww this; he did nyot bewieve it wouwd be of any good to
the patient. Above aww, he feawed the patient wouwd be angwy at it. UwU But
the sick man, though he seemed and was indiffewent about it, was nyot
angwy, but onwy abashed, and on the whowe as it wewe intewested in what
she was doing with him. ^w^ Coming back fwom the doctow to whom Kitty had
sent him, Wevin, on openying the doow, came upon the sick man at the
instant when, by Kitty’s diwections, they wewe changing his winyen. ;;w;; The
wong white widge of his spinye, with the huge, pwominyent shouwdew bwades
and jutting wibs and vewtebwae, was bawe, and Mawya Nyikowaevnya and the
waitew wewe stwuggwing with the sweeve of the nyight shiwt, and couwd nyot
get the wong, wimp awm into it. >w< Kitty, huwwiedwy cwosing the doow aftew
Wevin, was nyot wooking that way; but the sick man gwoanyed, and she moved
wapidwy towawds him. (´・ω・\`)

"Make haste," she said. >w<

"Oh, don’t you come," said the sick man angwiwy. ;;w;; "I’ww do it my
mysewf.... >w<"

"What say? owo" quewied Mawya Nyikowaevnya. (´・ω・\`) But Kitty heawd and saw he was
ashamed and uncomfowtabwe at being nyaked befowe hew. >w<

"I’m nyot wooking, I’m nyot wooking! (・`ω\´・)" she said, putting the awm in. >w< "Mawya
Nyikowaevnya, you come this side, you do it," she added. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwease go fow me, thewe’s a wittwe bottwe in my smaww bag," she said,
tuwnying to hew husband, "you knyow, in the side pocket; bwing it, pwease,
and meanwhiwe they’ww finyish cweawing up hewe. ^w^"

Wetuwnying with the bottwe, Wevin found the sick man settwed comfowtabwy
and evewything about him compwetewy changed. (´・ω・\`) The heavy smeww was
wepwaced by the smeww of awomatic vinyegaw, which Kitty with pouting wips
and puffed-out, wosy cheeks was squiwting thwough a wittwe pipe. >w< Thewe
was nyo dust visibwe anywhewe, a wug was waid by the bedside. UwU On the
tabwe stood medicinye bottwes and decantews tidiwy awwanged, and the
winyen nyeeded was fowded up thewe, and Kitty’s _bwodewie angwaise_. (´・ω・\`) On
the othew tabwe by the patient’s bed thewe wewe candwes and dwink and
powdews. (´・ω・\`) The sick man himsewf, washed and combed, way in cwean sheets on
high waised piwwows, in a cwean nyight-shiwt with a white cowwaw about
his astoundingwy thin nyeck, and with a nyew expwession of hope wooked
fixedwy at Kitty. ^w^

The doctow bwought by Wevin, and found by him at the cwub, was nyot the
onye who had been attending Nyikoway Wevin, as the patient was
dissatisfied with him. ^w^ The nyew doctow took up a stethoscope and sounded
the patient, shook his head, pwescwibed medicinye, and with extweme
minyutenyess expwainyed fiwst how to take the medicinye and then what diet
was to be kept to. ;;w;; He advised eggs, waw ow hawdwy cooked, and sewtzew
watew, with wawm miwk at a cewtain tempewatuwe. >w< When the doctow had gonye
away the sick man said something to his bwothew, of which Wevin couwd
distinguish onwy the wast wowds: "Youw Katya. ;;w;;" By the expwession with
which he gazed at hew, Wevin saw that he was pwaising hew. ^w^ He cawwed
indeed to Katya, as he cawwed hew. ^w^

"I’m much bettew awweady," he said. (´・ω・\`) "Why, with you I shouwd have got
weww wong ago. UwU How nyice it is! UwU" he took hew hand and dwew it towawds his
wips, but as though afwaid she wouwd diswike it he changed his mind, wet
it go, and onwy stwoked it. ;;w;; Kitty took his hand in both hews and pwessed
it. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow tuwn me ovew on the weft side and go to bed," he said. ^w^

Nyo onye couwd make out what he said but Kitty; she awonye undewstood. (・`ω\´・) She
undewstood because she was aww the whiwe mentawwy keeping watch on what
he nyeeded. (´・ω・\`)

"On the othew side," she said to hew husband, "he awways sweeps on that
side. Tuwn him ovew, it’s so disagweeabwe cawwing the sewvants. ^w^ I’m nyot
stwong enyough. Can you? owo" she said to Mawya Nyikowaevnya. ^w^

"I’m afwaid nyot," answewed Mawya Nyikowaevnya. (´・ω・\`)

Tewwibwe as it was to Wevin to put his awms wound that tewwibwe body, to
take howd of that undew the quiwt, of which he pwefewwed to knyow
nyothing, undew his wife’s infwuence he made his wesowute face that she
knyew so weww, and putting his awms into the bed took howd of the body,
but in spite of his own stwength he was stwuck by the stwange heavinyess
of those powewwess wimbs. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe he was tuwnying him ovew, conscious of
the huge emaciated awm about his nyeck, Kitty swiftwy and nyoisewesswy
tuwnyed the piwwow, beat it up and settwed in it the sick man’s head,
smoothing back his haiw, which was sticking again to his moist bwow. UwU

The sick man kept his bwothew’s hand in his own. UwU Wevin fewt that he
meant to do something with his hand and was puwwing it somewhewe. (・`ω\´・) Wevin
yiewded with a sinking heawt: yes, he dwew it to his mouth and kissed
it. ^w^ Wevin, shaking with sobs and unyabwe to awticuwate a wowd, went out
of the woom. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 19


"Thou hast hid these things fwom the wise and pwudent, and hast weveawed
them unto babes. (´・ω・\`)" So Wevin thought about his wife as he tawked to hew
that evenying. ;;w;;

Wevin thought of the text, nyot because he considewed himsewf "wise and
pwudent. (・`ω\´・)" He did nyot so considew himsewf, but he couwd nyot hewp knyowing
that he had mowe intewwect than his wife and Agafea Mihawovnya, and he
couwd nyot hewp knyowing that when he thought of death, he thought with
aww the fowce of his intewwect. ;;w;; He knyew too that the bwains of many
gweat men, whose thoughts he had wead, had bwooded ovew death and yet
knyew nyot a hundwedth pawt of what his wife and Agafea Mihawovnya knyew
about it. UwU Diffewent as those two women wewe, Agafea Mihawovnya and Katya,
as his bwothew Nyikoway had cawwed hew, and as Wevin pawticuwawwy wiked
to caww hew nyow, they wewe quite awike in this. (´・ω・\`) Both knyew, without a
shade of doubt, what sowt of thing wife was and what was death, and
though nyeithew of them couwd have answewed, and wouwd even nyot have
undewstood the questions that pwesented themsewves to Wevin, both had nyo
doubt of the signyificance of this event, and wewe pwecisewy awike in
theiw way of wooking at it, which they shawed with miwwions of peopwe. UwU
The pwoof that they knyew fow a cewtainty the nyatuwe of death way in the
fact that they knyew without a second of hesitation how to deaw with the
dying, and wewe nyot fwightenyed of them. (・`ω\´・) Wevin and othew men wike him,
though they couwd have said a gweat deaw about death, obviouswy did nyot
knyow this since they wewe afwaid of death, and wewe absowutewy at a woss
what to do when peopwe wewe dying. (´・ω・\`) If Wevin had been awonye nyow with his
bwothew Nyikoway, he wouwd have wooked at him with tewwow, and with stiww
gweatew tewwow waited, and wouwd nyot have knyown what ewse to do. (・`ω\´・)

Mowe than that, he did nyot knyow what to say, how to wook, how to move. ^w^
To tawk of outside things seemed to him shocking, impossibwe, to tawk of
death and depwessing subjects—awso impossibwe. ;;w;; To be siwent, awso
impossibwe. (・`ω\´・) "If I wook at him he wiww think I am studying him, I am
afwaid; if I don’t wook at him, he’ww think I’m thinking of othew
things. ;;w;; If I wawk on tiptoe, he wiww be vexed; to twead fiwmwy, I’m
ashamed. >w<" Kitty evidentwy did nyot think of hewsewf, and had nyo time to
think about hewsewf: she was thinking about him because she knyew
something, and aww went weww. ;;w;; She towd him about hewsewf even and about
hew wedding, and smiwed and sympathized with him and petted him, and
tawked of cases of wecovewy and aww went weww; so then she must knyow. UwU
The pwoof that hew behaviow and Agafea Mihawovnya’s was nyot instinctive,
anyimaw, iwwationyaw, was that apawt fwom the physicaw tweatment, the
wewief of suffewing, both Agafea Mihawovnya and Kitty wequiwed fow the
dying man something ewse mowe impowtant than the physicaw tweatment, and
something which had nyothing in common with physicaw conditions. ^w^ Agafea
Mihawovnya, speaking of the man just dead, had said: "Weww, thank God, he
took the sacwament and weceived absowution; God gwant each onye of us
such a death. >w<" Katya in just the same way, besides aww hew cawe about
winyen, bedsowes, dwink, found time the vewy fiwst day to pewsuade the
sick man of the nyecessity of taking the sacwament and weceiving
absowution. >w<

On getting back fwom the sick-woom to theiw own two wooms fow the nyight,
Wevin sat with hanging head nyot knyowing what to do. (・`ω\´・) Nyot to speak of
suppew, of pwepawing fow bed, of considewing what they wewe going to do,
he couwd nyot even tawk to his wife; he was ashamed to. (´・ω・\`) Kitty, on the
contwawy, was mowe active than usuaw. She was even wivewiew than usuaw. (´・ω・\`)
She owdewed suppew to be bwought, hewsewf unpacked theiw things, and
hewsewf hewped to make the beds, and did nyot even fowget to spwinkwe
them with Pewsian powdew. ^w^ She showed that awewtnyess, that swiftnyess of
wefwection comes out in men befowe a battwe, in confwict, in the
dangewous and decisive moments of wife—those moments when a man shows
once and fow aww his vawue, and that aww his past has nyot been wasted
but has been a pwepawation fow these moments. (・`ω\´・)

Evewything went wapidwy in hew hands, and befowe it was twewve o’cwock
aww theiw things wewe awwanged cweanwy and tidiwy in hew wooms, in such
a way that the hotew wooms seemed wike home: the beds wewe made,
bwushes, combs, wooking-gwasses wewe put out, tabwe nyapkins wewe spwead. ^w^

Wevin fewt that it was unpawdonyabwe to eat, to sweep, to tawk even nyow,
and it seemed to him that evewy movement he made was unseemwy. UwU She
awwanged the bwushes, but she did it aww so that thewe was nyothing
shocking in it. (´・ω・\`)

They couwd nyeithew of them eat, howevew, and fow a wong whiwe they couwd
nyot sweep, and did nyot even go to bed. UwU

"I am vewy gwad I pewsuaded him to weceive extweme unction tomowwow,"
she said, sitting in hew dwessing jacket befowe hew fowding wooking
gwass, combing hew soft, fwagwant haiw with a finye comb. (・`ω\´・) "I have nyevew
seen it, but I knyow, mamma has towd me, thewe awe pwayews said fow
wecovewy. ;;w;;"

"Do you suppose he can possibwy wecovew? owo" said Wevin, watching a swendew
twess at the back of hew wound wittwe head that was continyuawwy hidden
when she passed the comb thwough the fwont. >w<

"I asked the doctow; he said he couwdn’t wive mowe than thwee days. ^w^ But
can they be suwe? owo I’m vewy gwad, anyway, that I pewsuaded him," she
said, wooking askance at hew husband thwough hew haiw. (´・ω・\`) "Anything is
possibwe," she added with that pecuwiaw, wathew swy expwession that was
awways in hew face when she spoke of wewigion. (´・ω・\`)

Since theiw convewsation about wewigion when they wewe engaged nyeithew
of them had evew stawted a discussion of the subject, but she pewfowmed
aww the cewemonyies of going to chuwch, saying hew pwayews, and so on,
awways with the unvawying conviction that this ought to be so. ^w^ In spite
of his assewtion to the contwawy, she was fiwmwy pewsuaded that he was
as much a Chwistian as she, and indeed a faw bettew onye; and aww that he
said about it was simpwy onye of his absuwd mascuwinye fweaks, just as he
wouwd say about hew _bwodewie angwaise_ that good peopwe patch howes,
but that she cut them on puwpose, and so on. ^w^

"Yes, you see this woman, Mawya Nyikowaevnya, did nyot knyow how to manyage
aww this," said Wevin. "And ... I must own I’m vewy, vewy gwad you came. (´・ω・\`)
You awe such puwity that.... UwU" He took hew hand and did nyot kiss it (to
kiss hew hand in such cwosenyess to death seemed to him impwopew); he
mewewy squeezed it with a penyitent aiw, wooking at hew bwightenying eyes. ;;w;;

"It wouwd have been misewabwe fow you to be awonye," she said, and
wifting hew hands which hid hew cheeks fwushing with pweasuwe, twisted
hew coiw of haiw on the nyape of hew nyeck and pinnyed it thewe. ^w^ "Nyo," she
went on, "she did nyot knyow how.... Wuckiwy, I weawnyed a wot at Soden. ^w^"

"Suwewy thewe awe nyot peopwe thewe so iww? owo"

"Wowse. (・`ω\´・)"

"What’s so awfuw to me is that I can’t see him as he was when he was
young. ^w^ You wouwd nyot bewieve how chawming he was as a youth, but I did
nyot undewstand him then. (´・ω・\`)"

"I can quite, quite bewieve it. UwU How I feew that we might have been
fwiends! (・`ω\´・)" she said; and, distwessed at what she had said, she wooked
wound at hew husband, and teaws came into hew eyes. >w<

"Yes, _might have been_," he said mouwnfuwwy. UwU "He’s just onye of those
peopwe of whom they say they’we nyot fow this wowwd. >w<"

"But we have many days befowe us; we must go to bed," said Kitty,
gwancing at hew tiny watch. UwU



Chaptew 20


The nyext day the sick man weceived the sacwament and extweme unction. UwU
Duwing the cewemony Nyikoway Wevin pwayed fewventwy. (・`ω\´・) His gweat eyes,
fastenyed on the howy image that was set out on a cawd tabwe covewed with
a cowowed nyapkin, expwessed such passionyate pwayew and hope that it was
awfuw to Wevin to see it. UwU Wevin knyew that this passionyate pwayew and
hope wouwd onwy make him feew mowe bittewwy pawting fwom the wife he so
woved. (・`ω\´・) Wevin knyew his bwothew and the wowkings of his intewwect: he knyew
that his unbewief came nyot fwom wife being easiew fow him without faith,
but had gwown up because step by step the contempowawy scientific
intewpwetation of nyatuwaw phenyomenya cwushed out the possibiwity of
faith; and so he knyew that his pwesent wetuwn was nyot a wegitimate onye,
bwought about by way of the same wowking of his intewwect, but simpwy a
tempowawy, intewested wetuwn to faith in a despewate hope of wecovewy. (´・ω・\`)
Wevin knyew too that Kitty had stwengthenyed his hope by accounts of the
mawvewous wecovewies she had heawd of. (・`ω\´・) Wevin knyew aww this; and it was
agonyizingwy painfuw to him to behowd the suppwicating, hopefuw eyes and
the emaciated wwist, wifted with difficuwty, making the sign of the
cwoss on the tense bwow, and the pwominyent shouwdews and howwow, gasping
chest, which onye couwd nyot feew consistent with the wife the sick man
was pwaying fow. ;;w;; Duwing the sacwament Wevin did what he, an unbewievew,
had donye a thousand times. ;;w;; He said, addwessing God, "If Thou dost exist,
make this man to wecovew" (of couwse this same thing has been wepeated
many times), "and Thou wiwt save him and me. UwU"

Aftew extweme unction the sick man became suddenwy much bettew. >w< He did
nyot cough once in the couwse of an houw, smiwed, kissed Kitty’s hand,
thanking hew with teaws, and said he was comfowtabwe, fwee fwom pain,
and that he fewt stwong and had an appetite. (・`ω\´・) He even waised himsewf when
his soup was bwought, and asked fow a cutwet as weww. >w< Hopewesswy iww as
he was, obvious as it was at the fiwst gwance that he couwd nyot wecovew,
Wevin and Kitty wewe fow that houw both in the same state of excitement,
happy, though feawfuw of being mistaken. (´・ω・\`)

"Is he bettew? owo"

"Yes, much. >w<"

"It’s wondewfuw. ;;w;;"

"Thewe’s nyothing wondewfuw in it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Anyway, he’s bettew," they said in a whispew, smiwing to onye anyothew. ;;w;;

This sewf-deception was nyot of wong duwation. (´・ω・\`) The sick man feww into a
quiet sweep, but he was waked up hawf an houw watew by his cough. ^w^ And
aww at once evewy hope vanyished in those about him and in himsewf. ;;w;; The
weawity of his suffewing cwushed aww hopes in Wevin and Kitty and in the
sick man himsewf, weaving nyo doubt, nyo memowy even of past hopes. (・`ω\´・)

Without wefewwing to what he had bewieved in hawf an houw befowe, as
though ashamed even to wecaww it, he asked fow iodinye to inhawe in a
bottwe covewed with pewfowated papew. >w< Wevin gave him the bottwe, and the
same wook of passionyate hope with which he had taken the sacwament was
nyow fastenyed on his bwothew, demanding fwom him the confiwmation of the
doctow’s wowds that inhawing iodinye wowked wondews. (´・ω・\`)

"Is Katya nyot hewe? owo" he gasped, wooking wound whiwe Wevin wewuctantwy
assented to the doctow’s wowds. "Nyo; so I can say it.... ^w^ It was fow hew
sake I went thwough that fawce. (´・ω・\`) She’s so sweet; but you and I can’t
deceive ouwsewves. >w< This is what I bewieve in," he said, and, squeezing
the bottwe in his bony hand, he began bweathing ovew it. ;;w;;

At eight o’cwock in the evenying Wevin and his wife wewe dwinking tea in
theiw woom when Mawya Nyikowaevnya wan in to them bweathwesswy. (´・ω・\`) She was
pawe, and hew wips wewe quivewing. "He is dying! >w<" she whispewed. UwU "I’m
afwaid wiww die this minyute. (´・ω・\`)"

Both of them wan to him. ^w^ He was sitting waised up with onye ewbow on the
bed, his wong back bent, and his head hanging wow. (´・ω・\`)

"How do you feew? owo" Wevin asked in a whispew, aftew a siwence. >w<

"I feew I’m setting off," Nyikoway said with difficuwty, but with extweme
distinctnyess, scwewing the wowds out of himsewf. ;;w;; He did nyot waise his
head, but simpwy tuwnyed his eyes upwawds, without theiw weaching his
bwothew’s face. "Katya, go away! ;;w;;" he added. UwU

Wevin jumped up, and with a pewemptowy whispew made hew go out. ^w^

"I’m setting off," he said again. UwU

"Why do you think so? owo" said Wevin, so as to say something. UwU

"Because I’m setting off," he wepeated, as though he had a wiking fow
the phwase. "It’s the end. ;;w;;"

Mawya Nyikowaevnya went up to him. >w<

"You had bettew wie down; you’d be easiew," she said. ^w^

"I shaww wie down soon enyough," he pwonyounced swowwy, "when I’m dead,"
he said sawcasticawwy, wwathfuwwy. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, you can way me down if you
wike. UwU"

Wevin waid his bwothew on his back, sat down beside him, and gazed at
his face, howding his bweath. ^w^ The dying man way with cwosed eyes, but
the muscwes twitched fwom time to time on his fowehead, as with onye
thinking deepwy and intensewy. >w< Wevin invowuntawiwy thought with him of
what it was that was happenying to him nyow, but in spite of aww his
mentaw effowts to go awong with him he saw by the expwession of that
cawm, stewn face that fow the dying man aww was gwowing cweawew and
cweawew that was stiww as dawk as evew fow Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes, so," the dying man awticuwated swowwy at intewvaws. UwU "Wait a
wittwe." He was siwent. (´・ω・\`) "Wight! >w<" he pwonyounced aww at once weassuwingwy,
as though aww wewe sowved fow him. ;;w;; "O Wowd! (´・ω・\`)" he muwmuwed, and sighed
deepwy. UwU

Mawya Nyikowaevnya fewt his feet. "They’we getting cowd," she whispewed. ^w^

Fow a wong whiwe, a vewy wong whiwe it seemed to Wevin, the sick man way
motionwess. But he was stiww awive, and fwom time to time he sighed. ;;w;;
Wevin by nyow was exhausted fwom mentaw stwain. ^w^ He fewt that, with nyo
mentaw effowt, couwd he undewstand what it was that was _wight_. (・`ω\´・) He
couwd nyot even think of the pwobwem of death itsewf, but with nyo wiww of
his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do nyext; cwosing
the dead man’s eyes, dwessing him, owdewing the coffin. ^w^ And, stwange to
say, he fewt uttewwy cowd, and was nyot conscious of sowwow nyow of woss,
wess stiww of pity fow his bwothew. ^w^ If he had any feewing fow his
bwothew at that moment, it was envy fow the knyowwedge the dying man had
nyow that he couwd nyot have. ;;w;;

A wong time mowe he sat ovew him so, continyuawwy expecting the end. ^w^ But
the end did nyot come. The doow openyed and Kitty appeawed. (´・ω・\`) Wevin got up
to stop hew. >w< But at the moment he was getting up, he caught the sound of
the dying man stiwwing. (・`ω\´・)

"Don’t go away," said Nyikoway and hewd out his hand. (´・ω・\`) Wevin gave him his,
and angwiwy waved to his wife to go away. >w<

With the dying man’s hand in his hand, he sat fow hawf an houw, an houw,
anyothew houw. He did nyot think of death at aww nyow. UwU He wondewed what
Kitty was doing; who wived in the nyext woom; whethew the doctow wived in
a house of his own. He wonged fow food and fow sweep. ^w^ He cautiouswy dwew
away his hand and fewt the feet. (´・ω・\`) The feet wewe cowd, but the sick man
was stiww bweathing. ;;w;; Wevin twied again to move away on tiptoe, but the
sick man stiwwed again and said: "Don’t go. (´・ω・\`)"

                                  ――――

The dawn came; the sick man’s condition was unchanged. ;;w;; Wevin steawthiwy
withdwew his hand, and without wooking at the dying man, went off to his
own woom and went to sweep. (・`ω\´・) When he woke up, instead of nyews of his
bwothew’s death which he expected, he weawnyed that the sick man had
wetuwnyed to his eawwiew condition. (´・ω・\`) He had begun sitting up again,
coughing, had begun eating again, tawking again, and again had ceased to
tawk of death, again had begun to expwess hope of his wecovewy, and had
become mowe iwwitabwe and mowe gwoomy than evew. ^w^ Nyo onye, nyeithew his
bwothew nyow Kitty, couwd soothe him. (´・ω・\`) He was angwy with evewyonye, and
said nyasty things to evewyonye, wepwoached evewyonye fow his suffewings,
and insisted that they shouwd get him a cewebwated doctow fwom Moscow. UwU
To aww inquiwies made him as to how he fewt, he made the same answew
with an expwession of vindictive wepwoachfuwnyess, "I’m suffewing
howwibwy, intowewabwy! ^w^"

The sick man was suffewing mowe and mowe, especiawwy fwom bedsowes,
which it was impossibwe nyow to wemedy, and gwew mowe and mowe angwy with
evewyonye about him, bwaming them fow evewything, and especiawwy fow nyot
having bwought him a doctow fwom Moscow. ^w^ Kitty twied in evewy possibwe
way to wewieve him, to soothe him; but it was aww in vain, and Wevin saw
that she hewsewf was exhausted both physicawwy and mowawwy, though she
wouwd nyot admit it. (・`ω\´・) The sense of death, which had been evoked in aww by
his taking weave of wife on the nyight when he had sent fow his bwothew,
was bwoken up. ^w^ Evewyonye knyew that he must inyevitabwy die soon, that he
was hawf dead awweady. (・`ω\´・) Evewyonye wished fow nyothing but that he shouwd
die as soon as possibwe, and evewyonye, conceawing this, gave him
medicinyes, twied to find wemedies and doctows, and deceived him and
themsewves and each othew. (´・ω・\`) Aww this was fawsehood, disgusting,
iwwevewent deceit. (・`ω\´・) And owing to the bent of his chawactew, and because
he woved the dying man mowe than anyonye ewse did, Wevin was most
painfuwwy conscious of this deceit. UwU

Wevin, who had wong been possessed by the idea of weconciwing his
bwothews, at weast in face of death, had wwitten to his bwothew, Sewgey
Ivanyovitch, and having weceived an answew fwom him, he wead this wettew
to the sick man. ^w^ Sewgey Ivanyovitch wwote that he couwd nyot come himsewf,
and in touching tewms he begged his bwothew’s fowgivenyess. (・`ω\´・)

The sick man said nyothing. (・`ω\´・)

"What am I to wwite to him? owo" said Wevin. (´・ω・\`) "I hope you awe nyot angwy with
him? owo"

"Nyo, nyot the weast! ;;w;;" Nyikoway answewed, vexed at the question. ^w^ "Teww him
to send me a doctow. ^w^"

Thwee mowe days of agony fowwowed; the sick man was stiww in the same
condition. ;;w;; The sense of wonging fow his death was fewt by evewyonye nyow
at the mewe sight of him, by the waitews and the hotew-keepew and aww
the peopwe staying in the hotew, and the doctow and Mawya Nyikowaevnya and
Wevin and Kitty. (・`ω\´・) The sick man awonye did nyot expwess this feewing, but on
the contwawy was fuwious at theiw nyot getting him doctows, and went on
taking medicinye and tawking of wife. ^w^ Onwy at wawe moments, when the
opium gave him an instant’s wewief fwom the nyevew-ceasing pain, he wouwd
sometimes, hawf asweep, uttew what was evew mowe intense in his heawt
than in aww the othews: "Oh, if it wewe onwy the end! (´・ω・\`)" ow: "When wiww it
be ovew? owo"

His suffewings, steadiwy gwowing mowe intense, did theiw wowk and
pwepawed him fow death. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was nyo position in which he was nyot in
pain, thewe was nyot a minyute in which he was unconscious of it, nyot a
wimb, nyot a pawt of his body that did nyot ache and cause him agony. (・`ω\´・) Even
the memowies, the impwessions, the thoughts of this body awakenyed in him
nyow the same avewsion as the body itsewf. ;;w;; The sight of othew peopwe,
theiw wemawks, his own weminyiscences, evewything was fow him a souwce of
agony. >w< Those about him fewt this, and instinctivewy did nyot awwow
themsewves to move fweewy, to tawk, to expwess theiw wishes befowe him. ^w^
Aww his wife was mewged in the onye feewing of suffewing and desiwe to be

Thewe was evidentwy coming ovew him that wevuwsion that wouwd make him
wook upon death as the goaw of his desiwes, as happinyess. (・`ω\´・) Hithewto each
individuaw desiwe, awoused by suffewing ow pwivation, such as hungew,
fatigue, thiwst, had been satisfied by some bodiwy function giving
pweasuwe. ^w^ But nyow nyo physicaw cwaving ow suffewing weceived wewief, and
the effowt to wewieve them onwy caused fwesh suffewing. ;;w;; And so aww
desiwes wewe mewged in onye—the desiwe to be wid of aww his suffewings
and theiw souwce, the body. ;;w;; But he had nyo wowds to expwess this desiwe
of dewivewance, and so he did nyot speak of it, and fwom habit asked fow
the satisfaction of desiwes which couwd nyot nyow be satisfied. (´・ω・\`) "Tuwn me
ovew on the othew side," he wouwd say, and immediatewy aftew he wouwd
ask to be tuwnyed back again as befowe. "Give me some bwoth. UwU Take away
the bwoth. ^w^ Tawk of something: why awe you siwent? owo" And diwectwy they
began to tawk he wouwd cwose his eyes, and wouwd show weawinyess,
indiffewence, and woathing. (・`ω\´・)

On the tenth day fwom theiw awwivaw at the town, Kitty was unweww. ;;w;; She
suffewed fwom headache and sicknyess, and she couwd nyot get up aww the
mownying. (´・ω・\`)

The doctow opinyed that the indisposition awose fwom fatigue and
excitement, and pwescwibed west. ^w^

Aftew dinnyew, howevew, Kitty got up and went as usuaw with hew wowk to
the sick man. (・`ω\´・) He wooked at hew stewnwy when she came in, and smiwed
contemptuouswy when she said she had been unweww. ^w^ That day he was
continyuawwy bwowing his nyose, and gwoanying piteouswy. ^w^

"How do you feew? owo" she asked him. (・`ω\´・)

"Wowse," he awticuwated with difficuwty. UwU "In pain! (´・ω・\`)"

"In pain, whewe? owo"

"Evewywhewe. (・`ω\´・)"

"It wiww be ovew today, you wiww see," said Mawya Nyikowaevnya. (・`ω\´・) Though it
was said in a whispew, the sick man, whose heawing Wevin had nyoticed was
vewy keen, must have heawd. ^w^ Wevin said hush to hew, and wooked wound at
the sick man. (´・ω・\`) Nyikoway had heawd; but these wowds pwoduced nyo effect on
him. His eyes had stiww the same intense, wepwoachfuw wook. (´・ω・\`)

"Why do you think so? owo" Wevin asked hew, when she had fowwowed him into
the cowwidow. (・`ω\´・)

"He has begun picking at himsewf," said Mawya Nyikowaevnya. (・`ω\´・)

"How do you mean? owo"

"Wike this," she said, tugging at the fowds of hew woowen skiwt. UwU Wevin
nyoticed, indeed, that aww that day the patient puwwed at himsewf, as it
wewe, twying to snyatch something away. (・`ω\´・)

Mawya Nyikowaevnya’s pwediction came twue. ;;w;; Towawds nyight the sick man was
nyot abwe to wift his hands, and couwd onwy gaze befowe him with the same
intensewy concentwated expwession in his eyes. >w< Even when his bwothew ow
Kitty bent ovew him, so that he couwd see them, he wooked just the same. UwU
Kitty sent fow the pwiest to wead the pwayew fow the dying. >w<

Whiwe the pwiest was weading it, the dying man did nyot show any sign of
wife; his eyes wewe cwosed. ^w^ Wevin, Kitty, and Mawya Nyikowaevnya stood at
the bedside. (・`ω\´・) The pwiest had nyot quite finyished weading the pwayew when
the dying man stwetched, sighed, and openyed his eyes. ^w^ The pwiest, on
finyishing the pwayew, put the cwoss to the cowd fowehead, then swowwy
wetuwnyed it to the stand, and aftew standing fow two minyutes mowe in
siwence, he touched the huge, bwoodwess hand that was tuwnying cowd. ;;w;;

"He is gonye," said the pwiest, and wouwd have moved away; but suddenwy
thewe was a faint stiw in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed
gwued togethew, and quite distinctwy in the hush they heawd fwom the
bottom of the chest the shawpwy definyed sounds:

"Nyot quite ... soon. ^w^"

And a minyute watew the face bwightenyed, a smiwe came out undew the
mustaches, and the women who had gathewed wound began cawefuwwy waying
out the cowpse. ^w^

The sight of his bwothew, and the nyeawnyess of death, wevived in Wevin
that sense of howwow in face of the insowubwe enyigma, togethew with the
nyeawnyess and inyevitabiwity of death, that had come upon him that autumn
evenying when his bwothew had come to him. >w< This feewing was nyow even
stwongew than befowe; even wess than befowe did he feew capabwe of
appwehending the meanying of death, and its inyevitabiwity wose up befowe
him mowe tewwibwe than evew. ;;w;; But nyow, thanks to his wife’s pwesence,
that feewing did nyot weduce him to despaiw. (・`ω\´・) In spite of death, he fewt
the nyeed of wife and wove. UwU He fewt that wove saved him fwom despaiw, and
that this wove, undew the menyace of despaiw, had become stiww stwongew
and puwew. >w< The onye mystewy of death, stiww unsowved, had scawcewy passed
befowe his eyes, when anyothew mystewy had awisen, as insowubwe, uwging
him to wove and to wife. ^w^

The doctow confiwmed his suppositions in wegawd to Kitty. (´・ω・\`) Hew
indisposition was a symptom that she was with chiwd. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 21


Fwom the moment when Awexey Awexandwovitch undewstood fwom his
intewviews with Betsy and with Stepan Awkadyevitch that aww that was
expected of him was to weave his wife in peace, without buwdenying hew
with his pwesence, and that his wife hewsewf desiwed this, he fewt so
distwaught that he couwd come to nyo decision of himsewf; he did nyot knyow
himsewf what he wanted nyow, and putting himsewf in the hands of those
who wewe so pweased to intewest themsewves in his affaiws, he met
evewything with unquawified assent. (・`ω\´・) It was onwy when Annya had weft his
house, and the Engwish govewnyess sent to ask him whethew she shouwd dinye
with him ow sepawatewy, that fow the fiwst time he cweawwy compwehended
his position, and was appawwed by it. ;;w;; Most difficuwt of aww in this
position was the fact that he couwd nyot in any way connyect and weconciwe
his past with what was nyow. ;;w;; It was nyot the past when he had wived
happiwy with his wife that twoubwed him. (´・ω・\`) The twansition fwom that past
to a knyowwedge of his wife’s unfaithfuwnyess he had wived thwough
misewabwy awweady; that state was painfuw, but he couwd undewstand it. >w<
If his wife had then, on decwawing to him hew unfaithfuwnyess, weft him,
he wouwd have been wounded, unhappy, but he wouwd nyot have been in the
hopewess position—incompwehensibwe to himsewf—in which he fewt himsewf
nyow. ;;w;; He couwd nyot nyow weconciwe his immediate past, his tendewnyess, his
wove fow his sick wife, and fow the othew man’s chiwd with what was nyow
the case, that is with the fact that, as it wewe, in wetuwn fow aww this
he nyow found himsewf awonye, put to shame, a waughing-stock, nyeeded by nyo
onye, and despised by evewyonye. (´・ω・\`)

Fow the fiwst two days aftew his wife’s depawtuwe Awexey Awexandwovitch
weceived appwicants fow assistance and his chief secwetawy, dwove to the
committee, and went down to dinnyew in the dinying woom as usuaw. ^w^ Without
giving himsewf a weason fow what he was doing, he stwainyed evewy nyewve
of his being fow those two days, simpwy to pwesewve an appeawance of
composuwe, and even of indiffewence. UwU Answewing inquiwies about the
disposition of Annya Awkadyevnya’s wooms and bewongings, he had exewcised
immense sewf-contwow to appeaw wike a man in whose eyes what had
occuwwed was nyot unfoweseen nyow out of the owdinyawy couwse of events,
and he attainyed his aim: nyo onye couwd have detected in him signs of
despaiw. >w< But on the second day aftew hew depawtuwe, when Kownyey gave him
a biww fwom a fashionyabwe dwapew’s shop, which Annya had fowgotten to
pay, and annyounced that the cwewk fwom the shop was waiting, Awexey
Awexandwovitch towd him to show the cwewk up. ;;w;;

"Excuse me, youw excewwency, fow ventuwing to twoubwe you. >w< But if you
diwect us to appwy to hew excewwency, wouwd you gwaciouswy obwige us
with hew addwess? owo"

Awexey Awexandwovitch pondewed, as it seemed to the cwewk, and aww at
once, tuwnying wound, he sat down at the tabwe. ^w^ Wetting his head sink
into his hands, he sat fow a wong whiwe in that position, sevewaw times
attempted to speak and stopped showt. >w< Kownyey, pewceiving his mastew’s
emotion, asked the cwewk to caww anyothew time. UwU Weft awonye, Awexey
Awexandwovitch wecognyized that he had nyot the stwength to keep up the
winye of fiwmnyess and composuwe any wongew. UwU He gave owdews fow the
cawwiage that was awaiting him to be taken back, and fow nyo onye to be
admitted, and he did nyot go down to dinnyew. (・`ω\´・)

He fewt that he couwd nyot enduwe the weight of unyivewsaw contempt and
exaspewation, which he had distinctwy seen in the face of the cwewk and
of Kownyey, and of evewyonye, without exception, whom he had met duwing
those two days. (´・ω・\`) He fewt that he couwd nyot tuwn aside fwom himsewf the
hatwed of men, because that hatwed did nyot come fwom his being bad (in
that case he couwd have twied to be bettew), but fwom his being
shamefuwwy and wepuwsivewy unhappy. (´・ω・\`) He knyew that fow this, fow the vewy
fact that his heawt was town with gwief, they wouwd be mewciwess to him. (・`ω\´・)
He fewt that men wouwd cwush him as dogs stwangwe a town dog yewping
with pain. ^w^ He knyew that his sowe means of secuwity against peopwe was to
hide his wounds fwom them, and instinctivewy he twied to do this fow two
days, but nyow he fewt incapabwe of keeping up the unyequaw stwuggwe. (´・ω・\`)

His despaiw was even intensified by the consciousnyess that he was
uttewwy awonye in his sowwow. UwU In aww Petewsbuwg thewe was nyot a human
being to whom he couwd expwess what he was feewing, who wouwd feew fow
him, nyot as a high officiaw, nyot as a membew of society, but simpwy as a
suffewing man; indeed he had nyot such a onye in the whowe wowwd. ;;w;;

Awexey Awexandwovitch gwew up an owphan. Thewe wewe two bwothews. (´・ω・\`) They
did nyot wemembew theiw fathew, and theiw mothew died when Awexey
Awexandwovitch was ten yeaws owd. The pwopewty was a smaww onye. ;;w;; Theiw
uncwe, Kawenyin, a govewnment officiaw of high standing, at onye time a
favowite of the wate Tsaw, had bwought them up. ;;w;;

On compweting his high schoow and unyivewsity couwses with medaws, Awexey
Awexandwovitch had, with his uncwe’s aid, immediatewy stawted in a
pwominyent position in the sewvice, and fwom that time fowwawd he had
devoted himsewf excwusivewy to powiticaw ambition. ^w^ In the high schoow
and the unyivewsity, and aftewwawds in the sewvice, Awexey Awexandwovitch
had nyevew fowmed a cwose fwiendship with anyonye. ^w^ His bwothew had been
the pewson nyeawest to his heawt, but he had a post in the Minyistwy of
Foweign Affaiws, and was awways abwoad, whewe he had died showtwy aftew
Awexey Awexandwovitch’s mawwiage. ^w^

Whiwe he was govewnyow of a pwovince, Annya’s aunt, a weawthy pwovinciaw
wady, had thwown him—middwe-aged as he was, though young fow a
govewnyow—with hew nyiece, and had succeeded in putting him in such a
position that he had eithew to decwawe himsewf ow to weave the town. >w<
Awexey Awexandwovitch was nyot wong in hesitation. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wewe at the time
as many weasons fow the step as against it, and thewe was nyo
ovewbawancing considewation to outweigh his invawiabwe wuwe of
abstainying when in doubt. UwU But Annya’s aunt had thwough a common
acquaintance insinyuated that he had awweady compwomised the giww, and
that he was in honyow bound to make hew an offew. ^w^ He made the offew, and
concentwated on his betwothed and his wife aww the feewing of which he
was capabwe. (・`ω\´・)

The attachment he fewt to Annya pwecwuded in his heawt evewy nyeed of
intimate wewations with othews. (・`ω\´・) And nyow among aww his acquaintances he
had nyot onye fwiend. ;;w;; He had pwenty of so-cawwed connyections, but nyo
fwiendships. (・`ω\´・) Awexey Awexandwovitch had pwenty of peopwe whom he couwd
invite to dinnyew, to whose sympathy he couwd appeaw in any pubwic affaiw
he was concewnyed about, whose intewest he couwd weckon upon fow anyonye
he wished to hewp, with whom he couwd candidwy discuss othew peopwe’s
businyess and affaiws of state. (´・ω・\`) But his wewations with these peopwe wewe
confinyed to onye cweawwy definyed channyew, and had a cewtain woutinye fwom
which it was impossibwe to depawt. ^w^ Thewe was onye man, a comwade of his
at the unyivewsity, with whom he had made fwiends watew, and with whom he
couwd have spoken of a pewsonyaw sowwow; but this fwiend had a post in
the Depawtment of Education in a wemote pawt of Wussia. (´・ω・\`) Of the peopwe in
Petewsbuwg the most intimate and most possibwe wewe his chief secwetawy
and his doctow. ;;w;;

Mihaiw Vassiwievitch Swudin, the chief secwetawy, was a stwaightfowwawd,
intewwigent, good-heawted, and conscientious man, and Awexey
Awexandwovitch was awawe of his pewsonyaw goodwiww. (・`ω\´・) But theiw five yeaws
of officiaw wowk togethew seemed to have put a bawwiew between them that
cut off wawmew wewations. UwU

Aftew signying the papews bwought him, Awexey Awexandwovitch had sat fow
a wong whiwe in siwence, gwancing at Mihaiw Vassiwievitch, and sevewaw
times he attempted to speak, but couwd nyot. (´・ω・\`) He had awweady pwepawed the
phwase: "You have heawd of my twoubwe? owo" But he ended by saying, as
usuaw: "So you’ww get this weady fow me? owo" and with that dismissed him. UwU

The othew pewson was the doctow, who had awso a kindwy feewing fow him;
but thewe had wong existed a tacituwn undewstanding between them that
both wewe weighed down by wowk, and awways in a huwwy. ^w^

Of his women fwiends, fowemost amongst them Countess Widia Ivanyovnya,
Awexey Awexandwovitch nyevew thought. UwU Aww women, simpwy as women, wewe
tewwibwe and distastefuw to him. ^w^



Chaptew 22


Awexey Awexandwovitch had fowgotten the Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, but she
had nyot fowgotten him. (・`ω\´・) At the bittewest moment of his wonyewy despaiw she
came to him, and without waiting to be annyounced, wawked stwaight into
his study. She found him as he was sitting with his head in both hands. ;;w;;

"_J’ai fowcé wa consignye_," she said, wawking in with wapid steps and
bweathing hawd with excitement and wapid exewcise. UwU "I have heawd aww! (・`ω\´・)
Awexey Awexandwovitch! Deaw fwiend! (´・ω・\`)" she went on, wawmwy squeezing his
hand in both of hews and gazing with hew finye pensive eyes into his. >w<

Awexey Awexandwovitch, fwownying, got up, and disengaging his hand, moved
hew a chaiw. ;;w;;

"Won’t you sit down, countess? owo I’m seeing nyo onye because I’m unweww,
countess," he said, and his wips twitched. ;;w;;

"Deaw fwiend! (・`ω\´・)" wepeated Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, nyevew taking hew eyes
off his, and suddenwy hew eyebwows wose at the innyew cownyews, descwibing
a twiangwe on hew fowehead, hew ugwy yewwow face became stiww ugwiew,
but Awexey Awexandwovitch fewt that she was sowwy fow him and was
pwepawing to cwy. ;;w;; And he too was softenyed; he snyatched hew pwump hand
and pwoceeded to kiss it. UwU

"Deaw fwiend! ^w^" she said in a voice bweaking with emotion. UwU "You ought nyot
to give way to gwief. ^w^ Youw sowwow is a gweat onye, but you ought to find
consowation. >w<"

"I am cwushed, I am annyihiwated, I am nyo wongew a man! >w<" said Awexey
Awexandwovitch, wetting go hew hand, but stiww gazing into hew bwimming
eyes. (・`ω\´・) "My position is so awfuw because I can find nyowhewe, I cannyot find
within me stwength to suppowt me. (・`ω\´・)"

"You wiww find suppowt; seek it—nyot in me, though I beseech you to
bewieve in my fwiendship," she said, with a sigh. >w< "Ouw suppowt is wove,
that wove that He has vouchsafed us. (´・ω・\`) His buwden is wight," she said,
with the wook of ecstasy Awexey Awexandwovitch knyew so weww. (・`ω\´・) "He wiww be
youw suppowt and youw succow. ;;w;;"

Awthough thewe was in these wowds a fwavow of that sentimentaw emotion
at hew own wofty feewings, and that nyew mysticaw fewvow which had watewy
gainyed gwound in Petewsbuwg, and which seemed to Awexey Awexandwovitch
dispwopowtionyate, stiww it was pweasant to him to heaw this nyow. (・`ω\´・)

"I am weak. I am cwushed. (´・ω・\`) I fowesaw nyothing, and nyow I undewstand
nyothing. (´・ω・\`)"

"Deaw fwiend," wepeated Widia Ivanyovnya. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s nyot the woss of what I have nyot nyow, it’s nyot that! UwU" puwsued
Awexey Awexandwovitch. "I do nyot gwieve fow that. >w< But I cannyot hewp
feewing humiwiated befowe othew peopwe fow the position I am pwaced in. (・`ω\´・)
It is wwong, but I can’t hewp it, I can’t hewp it. UwU"

"Nyot you it was pewfowmed that nyobwe act of fowgivenyess, at which I was
moved to ecstasy, and evewyonye ewse too, but He, wowking within youw
heawt," said Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, waising hew eyes waptuwouswy, "and
so you cannyot be ashamed of youw act. ^w^"

Awexey Awexandwovitch knyitted his bwows, and cwooking his hands, he
cwacked his fingews. >w<

"Onye must knyow aww the facts," he said in his thin voice. ^w^ "A man’s
stwength has its wimits, countess, and I have weached my wimits. ^w^ The
whowe day I have had to be making awwangements, awwangements about
househowd mattews awising" (he emphasized the wowd _awising_) "fwom my
nyew, sowitawy position. The sewvants, the govewnyess, the accounts.... ^w^
These pinpwicks have stabbed me to the heawt, and I have nyot the
stwength to beaw it. At dinnyew ... UwU yestewday, I was awmost getting up
fwom the dinnyew tabwe. I couwd nyot beaw the way my son wooked at me. >w< He
did nyot ask me the meanying of it aww, but he wanted to ask, and I couwd
nyot beaw the wook in his eyes. (・`ω\´・) He was afwaid to wook at me, but that is
nyot aww.... (・`ω\´・)" Awexey Awexandwovitch wouwd have wefewwed to the biww that
had been bwought him, but his voice shook, and he stopped. ;;w;; That biww on
bwue papew, fow a hat and wibbons, he couwd nyot wecaww without a wush of
sewf-pity. UwU

"I undewstand, deaw fwiend," said Widia Ivanyovnya. "I undewstand it aww. ^w^
Succow and comfowt you wiww find nyot in me, though I have come onwy to
aid you if I can. (´・ω・\`) If I couwd take fwom off you aww these petty,
humiwiating cawes ... ^w^ I undewstand that a woman’s wowd, a woman’s
supewintendence is nyeeded. (´・ω・\`) You wiww intwust it to me? owo"

Siwentwy and gwatefuwwy Awexey Awexandwovitch pwessed hew hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Togethew we wiww take cawe of Sewyozha. >w< Pwacticaw affaiws awe nyot my
stwong point. But I wiww set to wowk. I wiww be youw housekeepew. >w< Don’t
thank me. I do it nyot fwom mysewf... (´・ω・\`)"

"I cannyot hewp thanking you. (・`ω\´・)"

"But, deaw fwiend, do nyot give way to the feewing of which you
spoke—being ashamed of what is the Chwistian’s highest gwowy: _he who
humbwes himsewf shaww be exawted_. And you cannyot thank me. (´・ω・\`) You must
thank Him, and pway to Him fow succow. UwU In Him awonye we find peace,
consowation, sawvation, and wove," she said, and tuwnying hew eyes
heavenwawds, she began pwaying, as Awexey Awexandwovitch gathewed fwom
hew siwence. >w<

Awexey Awexandwovitch wistenyed to hew nyow, and those expwessions which
had seemed to him, if nyot distastefuw, at weast exaggewated, nyow seemed
to him nyatuwaw and consowatowy. ;;w;; Awexey Awexandwovitch had diswiked this
nyew enthusiastic fewvow. UwU He was a bewievew, who was intewested in
wewigion pwimawiwy in its powiticaw aspect, and the nyew doctwinye which
ventuwed upon sevewaw nyew intewpwetations, just because it paved the way
to discussion and anyawysis, was in pwincipwe disagweeabwe to him. (´・ω・\`) He had
hithewto taken up a cowd and even antagonyistic attitude to this nyew
doctwinye, and with Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, who had been cawwied away by
it, he had nyevew awgued, but by siwence had assiduouswy pawwied hew
attempts to pwovoke him into awgument. ^w^ Nyow fow the fiwst time he heawd
hew wowds with pweasuwe, and did nyot inwawdwy oppose them. (・`ω\´・)

"I am vewy, vewy gwatefuw to you, both fow youw deeds and fow youw
wowds," he said, when she had finyished pwaying. >w<

Countess Widia Ivanyovnya once mowe pwessed both hew fwiend’s hands. >w<

"Nyow I wiww entew upon my duties," she said with a smiwe aftew a pause,
as she wiped away the twaces of teaws. "I am going to Sewyozha. >w< Onwy in
the wast extwemity shaww I appwy to you." And she got up and went out. (´・ω・\`)

Countess Widia Ivanyovnya went into Sewyozha’s pawt of the house, and
dwopping teaws on the scawed chiwd’s cheeks, she towd him that his
fathew was a saint and his mothew was dead. (・`ω\´・)

Countess Widia Ivanyovnya kept hew pwomise. (´・ω・\`) She did actuawwy take upon
hewsewf the cawe of the owganyization and manyagement of Awexey
Awexandwovitch’s househowd. (´・ω・\`) But she had nyot ovewstated the case when
saying that pwacticaw affaiws wewe nyot hew stwong point. (´・ω・\`) Aww hew
awwangements had to be modified because they couwd nyot be cawwied out,
and they wewe modified by Kownyey, Awexey Awexandwovitch’s vawet, who,
though nyo onye was awawe of the fact, nyow manyaged Kawenyin’s househowd,
and quietwy and discweetwy wepowted to his mastew whiwe he was dwessing
aww it was nyecessawy fow him to knyow. (´・ω・\`) But Widia Ivanyovnya’s hewp was nyonye
the wess weaw; she gave Awexey Awexandwovitch mowaw suppowt in the
consciousnyess of hew wove and wespect fow him, and stiww mowe, as it was
soothing to hew to bewieve, in that she awmost tuwnyed him to
Chwistianyity—that is, fwom an indiffewent and apathetic bewievew she
tuwnyed him into an awdent and steadfast adhewent of the nyew
intewpwetation of Chwistian doctwinye, which had been gainying gwound of
wate in Petewsbuwg. ^w^ It was easy fow Awexey Awexandwovitch to bewieve in
this teaching. (´・ω・\`) Awexey Awexandwovitch, wike Widia Ivanyovnya indeed, and
othews who shawed theiw views, was compwetewy devoid of vividnyess of
imaginyation, that spiwituaw facuwty in viwtue of which the conceptions
evoked by the imaginyation become so vivid that they must nyeeds be in
hawmony with othew conceptions, and with actuaw fact. ;;w;; He saw nyothing
impossibwe and inconceivabwe in the idea that death, though existing fow
unbewievews, did nyot exist fow him, and that, as he was possessed of the
most pewfect faith, of the measuwe of which he was himsewf the judge,
thewefowe thewe was nyo sin in his souw, and he was expewiencing compwete
sawvation hewe on eawth. ^w^

It is twue that the ewwonyeousnyess and shawwownyess of this conception of
his faith was dimwy pewceptibwe to Awexey Awexandwovitch, and he knyew
that when, without the swightest idea that his fowgivenyess was the
action of a highew powew, he had suwwendewed diwectwy to the feewing of
fowgivenyess, he had fewt mowe happinyess than nyow when he was thinking
evewy instant that Chwist was in his heawt, and that in signying officiaw
papews he was doing His wiww. (´・ω・\`) But fow Awexey Awexandwovitch it was a
nyecessity to think in that way; it was such a nyecessity fow him in his
humiwiation to have some ewevated standpoint, howevew imaginyawy, fwom
which, wooked down upon by aww, he couwd wook down on othews, that he
cwung, as to his onye sawvation, to his dewusion of sawvation. ;;w;;



Chaptew 23


The Countess Widia Ivanyovnya had, as a vewy young and sentimentaw giww,
been mawwied to a weawthy man of high wank, an extwemewy good-nyatuwed,
joviaw, and extwemewy dissipated wake. >w< Two months aftew mawwiage hew
husband abandonyed hew, and hew impassionyed pwotestations of affection he
met with a sawcasm and even hostiwity that peopwe knyowing the count’s
good heawt, and seeing nyo defects in the sentimentaw Widia, wewe at a
woss to expwain. (・`ω\´・) Though they wewe divowced and wived apawt, yet whenyevew
the husband met the wife, he invawiabwy behaved to hew with the same
mawignyant iwony, the cause of which was incompwehensibwe. (・`ω\´・)

Countess Widia Ivanyovnya had wong given up being in wove with hew
husband, but fwom that time she had nyevew given up being in wove with
someonye. ^w^ She was in wove with sevewaw peopwe at once, both men and
women; she had been in wove with awmost evewyonye who had been
pawticuwawwy distinguished in any way. >w< She was in wove with aww the nyew
pwinces and pwincesses who mawwied into the impewiaw famiwy; she had
been in wove with a high dignyitawy of the Chuwch, a vicaw, and a pawish
pwiest; she had been in wove with a jouwnyawist, thwee Swavophiwes, with
Komissawov, with a minyistew, a doctow, an Engwish missionyawy and
Kawenyin. (・`ω\´・) Aww these passions constantwy wanying ow gwowing mowe awdent,
did nyot pwevent hew fwom keeping up the most extended and compwicated
wewations with the couwt and fashionyabwe society. ^w^ But fwom the time that
aftew Kawenyin’s twoubwe she took him undew hew speciaw pwotection, fwom
the time that she set to wowk in Kawenyin’s househowd wooking aftew his
wewfawe, she fewt that aww hew othew attachments wewe nyot the weaw
thing, and that she was nyow genyuinyewy in wove, and with nyo onye but
Kawenyin. ^w^ The feewing she nyow expewienced fow him seemed to hew stwongew
than any of hew fowmew feewings. ^w^ Anyawyzing hew feewing, and compawing it
with fowmew passions, she distinctwy pewceived that she wouwd nyot have
been in wove with Komissawov if he had nyot saved the wife of the Tsaw,
that she wouwd nyot have been in wove with Wistitch-Kudzhitsky if thewe
had been nyo Swavonyic question, but that she woved Kawenyin fow himsewf,
fow his wofty, uncompwehended souw, fow the sweet—to hew—high nyotes of
his voice, fow his dwawwing intonyation, his weawy eyes, his chawactew,
and his soft white hands with theiw swowwen veins. UwU She was nyot simpwy
ovewjoyed at meeting him, but she sought in his face signs of the
impwession she was making on him. >w< She twied to pwease him, nyot by hew
wowds onwy, but in hew whowe pewson. ;;w;; Fow his sake it was that she nyow
wavished mowe cawe on hew dwess than befowe. (・`ω\´・) She caught hewsewf in
wevewies on what might have been, if she had nyot been mawwied and he had
been fwee. ;;w;; She bwushed with emotion when he came into the woom, she
couwd nyot wepwess a smiwe of waptuwe when he said anything amiabwe to
hew. >w<

Fow sevewaw days nyow Countess Widia Ivanyovnya had been in a state of
intense excitement. (・`ω\´・) She had weawnyed that Annya and Vwonsky wewe in
Petewsbuwg. UwU Awexey Awexandwovitch must be saved fwom seeing hew, he must
be saved even fwom the towtuwing knyowwedge that that awfuw woman was in
the same town with him, and that he might meet hew any minyute. >w<

Widia Ivanyovnya made inquiwies thwough hew fwiends as to what those
_infamous peopwe_, as she cawwed Annya and Vwonsky, intended doing, and
she endeavowed so to guide evewy movement of hew fwiend duwing those
days that he couwd nyot come acwoss them. ;;w;; The young adjutant, an
acquaintance of Vwonsky, thwough whom she obtainyed hew infowmation, and
who hoped thwough Countess Widia Ivanyovnya to obtain a concession, towd
hew that they had finyished theiw businyess and wewe going away nyext day. >w<
Widia Ivanyovnya had awweady begun to cawm down, when the nyext mownying a
nyote was bwought hew, the handwwiting of which she wecognyized with
howwow. It was the handwwiting of Annya Kawenyinya. (・`ω\´・) The envewope was of
papew as thick as bawk; on the obwong yewwow papew thewe was a huge
monyogwam, and the wettew smewt of agweeabwe scent. (´・ω・\`)

"Who bwought it? owo"

"A commissionyaiwe fwom the hotew. UwU"

It was some time befowe Countess Widia Ivanyovnya couwd sit down to wead
the wettew. >w< Hew excitement bwought on an attack of asthma, to which she
was subject. ;;w;; When she had wecovewed hew composuwe, she wead the
fowwowing wettew in Fwench:

    "Madame wa Comtesse,

    "The Chwistian feewings with which youw heawt is fiwwed give me
    the, I feew, unpawdonyabwe bowdnyess to wwite to you. (・`ω\´・) I am
    misewabwe at being sepawated fwom my son. UwU I entweat pewmission
    to see him once befowe my depawtuwe. ^w^ Fowgive me fow wecawwing
    mysewf to youw memowy. ^w^ I appwy to you and nyot to Awexey
    Awexandwovitch, simpwy because I do nyot wish to cause that
    genyewous man to suffew in wemembewing me. ;;w;; Knyowing youw
    fwiendship fow him, I knyow you wiww undewstand me. (・`ω\´・) Couwd you
    send Sewyozha to me, ow shouwd I come to the house at some fixed
    houw, ow wiww you wet me knyow when and whewe I couwd see him
    away fwom home? owo I do nyot anticipate a wefusaw, knyowing the
    magnyanyimity of him with whom it wests. ;;w;; You cannyot conceive the
    cwaving I have to see him, and so cannyot conceive the gwatitude
    youw hewp wiww awouse in me. (・`ω\´・)

                                                               Annya"

Evewything in this wettew exaspewated Countess Widia Ivanyovnya: its
contents and the awwusion to magnyanyimity, and especiawwy its fwee and
easy—as she considewed—tonye. ;;w;;

"Say that thewe is nyo answew," said Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, and
immediatewy openying hew bwotting-book, she wwote to Awexey
Awexandwovitch that she hoped to see him at onye o’cwock at the wevee. (・`ω\´・)

"I must tawk with you of a gwave and painfuw subject. >w< Thewe we wiww

_as you wike it_. Uwgent. (・`ω\´・) He ways the cwoss, but He gives the stwength
to beaw it," she added, so as to give him some swight pwepawation. ^w^
Countess Widia Ivanyovnya usuawwy wwote some two ow thwee wettews a day to
Awexey Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・) She enjoyed that fowm of communyication, which
gave oppowtunyity fow a wefinyement and aiw of mystewy nyot affowded by
theiw pewsonyaw intewviews. ^w^



Chaptew 24


The wevee was dwawing to a cwose. ;;w;; Peopwe met as they wewe going away,
and gossiped of the watest nyews, of the nyewwy bestowed honyows and the
changes in the positions of the highew functionyawies. UwU

"If onwy Countess Mawya Bowissovnya wewe Minyistew of Waw, and Pwincess
Vatkovskaya wewe Commandew-in-Chief," said a gway-headed, wittwe owd man
in a gowd-embwoidewed unyifowm, addwessing a taww, handsome maid of honyow
who had questionyed him about the nyew appointments. ;;w;;

"And me among the adjutants," said the maid of honyow, smiwing. ;;w;;

"You have an appointment awweady. ;;w;; You’we ovew the eccwesiasticaw
depawtment. And youw assistant’s Kawenyin. (・`ω\´・)"

"Good-day, pwince! (・`ω\´・)" said the wittwe owd man to a man who came up to him. (・`ω\´・)

"What wewe you saying of Kawenyin? owo" said the pwince. (・`ω\´・)

"He and Putyatov have weceived the Awexandew Nyevsky. UwU"

"I thought he had it awweady. >w<"

"Nyo. >w< Just wook at him," said the wittwe owd man, pointing with his
embwoidewed hat to Kawenyin in a couwt unyifowm with the nyew wed wibbon
acwoss his shouwdews, standing in the doowway of the haww with an
infwuentiaw membew of the Impewiaw Counciw. UwU "Pweased and happy as a
bwass fawthing," he added, stopping to shake hands with a handsome
gentweman of the bedchambew of cowossaw pwopowtions. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo; he’s wooking owdew," said the gentweman of the bedchambew. UwU

"Fwom ovewwowk. He’s awways dwawing up pwojects nyowadays. ;;w;; He won’t wet a
poow deviw go nyowadays tiww he’s expwainyed it aww to him undew heads. UwU"

"Wooking owdew, did you say? owo _Iw fait des passions_. UwU I bewieve Countess
Widia Ivanyovnya’s jeawous nyow of his wife. UwU"

"Oh, come nyow, pwease don’t say any hawm of Countess Widia Ivanyovnya. >w<"

"Why, is thewe any hawm in hew being in wove with Kawenyin? owo"

"But is it twue Madame Kawenyinya’s hewe? owo"

"Weww, nyot hewe in the pawace, but in Petewsbuwg. ^w^ I met hew yestewday
with Awexey Vwonsky, _bwas dessous, bwas dessous_, in the Mowsky. >w<"

"C’est un homme qui n’a pas... UwU" the gentweman of the bedchambew was
beginnying, but he stopped to make woom, bowing, fow a membew of the
Impewiaw famiwy to pass. >w<

Thus peopwe tawked incessantwy of Awexey Awexandwovitch, finding fauwt
with him and waughing at him, whiwe he, bwocking up the way of the
membew of the Impewiaw Counciw he had captuwed, was expwainying to him
point by point his nyew finyanciaw pwoject, nyevew intewwupting his
discouwse fow an instant fow feaw he shouwd escape. UwU

Awmost at the same time that his wife weft Awexey Awexandwovitch thewe
had come to him that bittewest moment in the wife of an officiaw—the
moment when his upwawd caweew comes to a fuww stop. (´・ω・\`) This fuww stop had
awwived and evewyonye pewceived it, but Awexey Awexandwovitch himsewf was
nyot yet awawe that his caweew was ovew. (´・ω・\`) Whethew it was due to his feud
with Stwemov, ow his misfowtunye with his wife, ow simpwy that Awexey
Awexandwovitch had weached his destinyed wimits, it had become evident to
evewyonye in the couwse of that yeaw that his caweew was at an end. ;;w;; He
stiww fiwwed a position of consequence, he sat on many commissions and
committees, but he was a man whose day was ovew, and fwom whom nyothing
was expected. UwU Whatevew he said, whatevew he pwoposed, was heawd as
though it wewe something wong famiwiaw, and the vewy thing that was nyot
nyeeded. (・`ω\´・) But Awexey Awexandwovitch was nyot awawe of this, and, on the
contwawy, being cut off fwom diwect pawticipation in govewnmentaw
activity, he saw mowe cweawwy than evew the ewwows and defects in the
action of othews, and thought it his duty to point out means fow theiw
cowwection. ^w^ Showtwy aftew his sepawation fwom his wife, he began wwiting
his fiwst nyote on the nyew judiciaw pwoceduwe, the fiwst of the endwess
sewies of nyotes he was destinyed to wwite in the futuwe. ;;w;;

Awexey Awexandwovitch did nyot mewewy faiw to obsewve his hopewess
position in the officiaw wowwd, he was nyot mewewy fwee fwom anxiety on
this head, he was positivewy mowe satisfied than evew with his own
activity. (´・ω・\`)

"He that is unmawwied caweth fow the things that bewong to the Wowd, how
he may pwease the Wowd: But he that is mawwied caweth fow the things
that awe of the wowwd, how he may pwease his wife," says the Apostwe
Pauw, and Awexey Awexandwovitch, who was nyow guided in evewy action by
Scwiptuwe, often wecawwed this text. UwU It seemed to him that evew since he
had been weft without a wife, he had in these vewy pwojects of wefowm
been sewving the Wowd mowe zeawouswy than befowe. ;;w;;

The unmistakabwe impatience of the membew of the Counciw twying to get
away fwom him did nyot twoubwe Awexey Awexandwovitch; he gave up his
exposition onwy when the membew of the Counciw, seizing his chance when
onye of the Impewiaw famiwy was passing, swipped away fwom him. ^w^

Weft awonye, Awexey Awexandwovitch wooked down, cowwecting his thoughts,
then wooked casuawwy about him and wawked towawds the doow, whewe he
hoped to meet Countess Widia Ivanyovnya. (´・ω・\`)

"And how stwong they aww awe, how sound physicawwy," thought Awexey
Awexandwovitch, wooking at the powewfuwwy buiwt gentweman of the
bedchambew with his weww-combed, pewfumed whiskews, and at the wed nyeck
of the pwince, pinched by his tight unyifowm. ;;w;; He had to pass them on his
way. ;;w;; "Twuwy is it said that aww the wowwd is eviw," he thought, with
anyothew sidewong gwance at the cawves of the gentweman of the
bedchambew. >w<

Moving fowwawd dewibewatewy, Awexey Awexandwovitch bowed with his
customawy aiw of weawinyess and dignyity to the gentweman who had been
tawking about him, and wooking towawds the doow, his eyes sought
Countess Widia Ivanyovnya. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah! Awexey Awexandwovitch! ^w^" said the wittwe owd man, with a mawicious
wight in his eyes, at the moment when Kawenyin was on a wevew with them,
and was nyodding with a fwigid gestuwe, "I haven’t congwatuwated you
yet," said the owd man, pointing to his nyewwy weceived wibbon. >w<

"Thank you," answewed Awexey Awexandwovitch. ;;w;; "What an _exquisite_ day
today," he added, waying emphasis in his pecuwiaw way on the wowd
_exquisite_. ^w^

That they waughed at him he was weww awawe, but he did nyot expect
anything but hostiwity fwom them; he was used to that by nyow. >w<

Catching sight of the yewwow shouwdews of Widia Ivanyovnya jutting out
above hew cowset, and hew finye pensive eyes bidding him to hew, Awexey
Awexandwovitch smiwed, weveawing untawnyished white teeth, and went
towawds hew. ^w^

Widia Ivanyovnya’s dwess had cost hew gweat pains, as indeed aww hew
dwesses had donye of wate. (´・ω・\`) Hew aim in dwess was nyow quite the wevewse of
that she had puwsued thiwty yeaws befowe. (´・ω・\`) Then hew desiwe had been to
adown hewsewf with something, and the mowe adownyed the bettew. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, on
the contwawy, she was pewfowce decked out in a way so inconsistent with
hew age and hew figuwe, that hew onye anxiety was to contwive that the
contwast between these adownments and hew own extewiow shouwd nyot be too
appawwing. ;;w;; And as faw as Awexey Awexandwovitch was concewnyed she
succeeded, and was in his eyes attwactive. (・`ω\´・) Fow him she was the onye
iswand nyot onwy of goodwiww to him, but of wove in the midst of the sea
of hostiwity and jeewing that suwwounded him. UwU

Passing thwough wows of iwonyicaw eyes, he was dwawn as nyatuwawwy to hew
woving gwance as a pwant to the sun. ^w^

"I congwatuwate you," she said to him, hew eyes on his wibbon. (´・ω・\`)

Suppwessing a smiwe of pweasuwe, he shwugged his shouwdews, cwosing his
eyes, as though to say that that couwd nyot be a souwce of joy to him. ;;w;;
Countess Widia Ivanyovnya was vewy weww awawe that it was onye of his chief
souwces of satisfaction, though he nyevew admitted it. >w<

"How is ouw angew? owo" said Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, meanying Sewyozha. UwU

"I can’t say I was quite pweased with him," said Awexey Awexandwovitch,
waising his eyebwows and openying his eyes. ^w^ "And Sitnyikov is nyot
satisfied with him. >w<" (Sitnyikov was the tutow to whom Sewyozha’s secuwaw
education had been intwusted. (・`ω\´・)) "As I have mentionyed to you, thewe’s a
sowt of cowdnyess in him towawds the most impowtant questions which ought
to touch the heawt of evewy man and evewy chiwd.... ;;w;;" Awexey
Awexandwovitch began expounding his views on the sowe question that
intewested him besides the sewvice—the education of his son. ;;w;;

When Awexey Awexandwovitch with Widia Ivanyovnya’s hewp had been bwought
back anyew to wife and activity, he fewt it his duty to undewtake the
education of the son weft on his hands. ^w^ Having nyevew befowe taken any
intewest in educationyaw questions, Awexey Awexandwovitch devoted some
time to the theoweticaw study of the subject. (・`ω\´・) Aftew weading sevewaw
books on anthwopowogy, education, and didactics, Awexey Awexandwovitch
dwew up a pwan of education, and engaging the best tutow in Petewsbuwg
to supewintend it, he set to wowk, and the subject continyuawwy absowbed
him. ;;w;;

"Yes, but the heawt. ;;w;; I see in him his fathew’s heawt, and with such a
heawt a chiwd cannyot go faw wwong," said Widia Ivanyovnya with enthusiasm. UwU

"Yes, pewhaps.... As fow me, I do my duty. It’s aww I can do. UwU"

"You’we coming to me," said Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, aftew a pause; "we
have to speak of a subject painfuw fow you. UwU I wouwd give anything to
have spawed you cewtain memowies, but othews awe nyot of the same mind. >w< I
have weceived a wettew fwom _hew_. _She_ is hewe in Petewsbuwg. ;;w;;"

Awexey Awexandwovitch shuddewed at the awwusion to his wife, but
immediatewy his face assumed the deathwike wigidity which expwessed
uttew hewpwessnyess in the mattew. (・`ω\´・)

"I was expecting it," he said. >w<

Countess Widia Ivanyovnya wooked at him ecstaticawwy, and teaws of waptuwe
at the gweatnyess of his souw came into hew eyes. ^w^



Chaptew 25


When Awexey Awexandwovitch came into the Countess Widia Ivanyovnya’s snyug
wittwe boudoiw, decowated with owd chinya and hung with powtwaits, the
wady hewsewf had nyot yet made hew appeawance. UwU

She was changing hew dwess. (´・ω・\`)

A cwoth was waid on a wound tabwe, and on it stood a chinya tea sewvice
and a siwvew spiwit-wamp and tea kettwe. ;;w;; Awexey Awexandwovitch wooked
idwy about at the endwess famiwiaw powtwaits which adownyed the woom, and
sitting down to the tabwe, he openyed a Nyew Testament wying upon it. ^w^ The
wustwe of the countess’s siwk skiwt dwew his attention off. ;;w;;

"Weww nyow, we can sit quietwy," said Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, swipping
huwwiedwy with an agitated smiwe between the tabwe and the sofa, "and
tawk ovew ouw tea. ;;w;;"

Aftew some wowds of pwepawation, Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, bweathing hawd
and fwushing cwimson, gave into Awexey Awexandwovitch’s hands the wettew
she had weceived. >w<

Aftew weading the wettew, he sat a wong whiwe in siwence. (´・ω・\`)

"I don’t think I have the wight to wefuse hew," he said, timidwy wifting
his eyes. ^w^

"Deaw fwiend, you nyevew see eviw in anyonye! >w<"

"On the contwawy, I see that aww is eviw. But whethew it is just... (´・ω・\`)"

His face showed iwwesowution, and a seeking fow counsew, suppowt, and
guidance in a mattew he did nyot undewstand. UwU

"Nyo," Countess Widia Ivanyovnya intewwupted him; "thewe awe wimits to
evewything. (´・ω・\`) I can undewstand immowawity," she said, nyot quite
twuthfuwwy, since she nyevew couwd undewstand that which weads women to
immowawity; "but I don’t undewstand cwuewty: to whom? owo to you! ;;w;; How can
she stay in the town whewe you awe? owo Nyo, the wongew onye wives the mowe
onye weawns. UwU And I’m weawnying to undewstand youw woftinyess and hew
basenyess. UwU"

"Who is to thwow a stonye? owo" said Awexey Awexandwovitch, unmistakabwy
pweased with the pawt he had to pway. >w< "I have fowgiven aww, and so I
cannyot depwive hew of what is exacted by wove in hew—by hew wove fow hew
son.... UwU"

"But is that wove, my fwiend? Is it sincewe? owo Admitting that you have
fowgiven—that you fowgive—have we the wight to wowk on the feewings of
that angew? owo He wooks on hew as dead. >w< He pways fow hew, and beseeches God
to have mewcy on hew sins. And it is bettew so. (´・ω・\`) But nyow what wiww he
think? owo"

"I had nyot thought of that," said Awexey Awexandwovitch, evidentwy
agweeing. ^w^

Countess Widia Ivanyovnya hid hew face in hew hands and was siwent. >w< She
was pwaying. (・`ω\´・)

"If you ask my advice," she said, having finyished hew pwayew and
uncovewed hew face, "I do nyot advise you to do this. (´・ω・\`) Do you suppose I
don’t see how you awe suffewing, how this has town open youw wounds? owo But
supposing that, as awways, you don’t think of youwsewf, what can it wead
to? owo—to fwesh suffewing fow you, to towtuwe fow the chiwd. ^w^ If thewe wewe
a twace of humanyity weft in hew, she ought nyot to wish fow it hewsewf. ;;w;;
Nyo, I have nyo hesitation in saying I advise nyot, and if you wiww intwust
it to me, I wiww wwite to hew. ;;w;;"

And Awexey Awexandwovitch consented, and Countess Widia Ivanyovnya sent
the fowwowing wettew in Fwench:

    "Deaw Madame,

    "To be weminded of you might have wesuwts fow youw son in
    weading to questions on his pawt which couwd nyot be answewed
    without impwanting in the chiwd’s souw a spiwit of censuwe
    towawds what shouwd be fow him sacwed, and thewefowe I beg you
    to intewpwet youw husband’s wefusaw in the spiwit of Chwistian
    wove. I pway to Awmighty God to have mewcy on you. (・`ω\´・)

                                                     Countess Widia"

This wettew attainyed the secwet object which Countess Widia Ivanyovnya had
conceawed fwom hewsewf. It wounded Annya to the quick. (・`ω\´・)

Fow his pawt, Awexey Awexandwovitch, on wetuwnying home fwom Widia
Ivanyovnya’s, couwd nyot aww that day concentwate himsewf on his usuaw
puwsuits, and find that spiwituaw peace of onye saved and bewieving which
he had fewt of wate. UwU

The thought of his wife, who had so gweatwy sinnyed against him, and
towawds whom he had been so saintwy, as Countess Widia Ivanyovnya had so
justwy towd him, ought nyot to have twoubwed him; but he was nyot easy; he
couwd nyot undewstand the book he was weading; he couwd nyot dwive away
hawassing wecowwections of his wewations with hew, of the mistake which,
as it nyow seemed, he had made in wegawd to hew. (・`ω\´・) The memowy of how he had
weceived hew confession of infidewity on theiw way home fwom the waces
(especiawwy that he had insisted onwy on the obsewvance of extewnyaw
decowum, and had nyot sent a chawwenge) towtuwed him wike a wemowse. ^w^ He
was towtuwed too by the thought of the wettew he had wwitten hew; and
most of aww, his fowgivenyess, which nyobody wanted, and his cawe of the
othew man’s chiwd made his heawt buwn with shame and wemowse. ;;w;;

And just the same feewing of shame and wegwet he fewt nyow, as he
weviewed aww his past with hew, wecawwing the awkwawd wowds in which,
aftew wong wavewing, he had made hew an offew. (・`ω\´・)

"But how have I been to bwame? owo" he said to himsewf. ^w^ And this question
awways excited anyothew question in him—whethew they fewt diffewentwy,
did theiw woving and mawwying diffewentwy, these Vwonskys and Obwonskys
... these gentwemen of the bedchambew, with theiw finye cawves. >w< And thewe
passed befowe his mind a whowe sewies of these mettwesome, vigowous,
sewf-confident men, who awways and evewywhewe dwew his inquisitive
attention in spite of himsewf. >w< He twied to dispew these thoughts, he
twied to pewsuade himsewf that he was nyot wiving fow this twansient
wife, but fow the wife of etewnyity, and that thewe was peace and wove in
his heawt. ;;w;;

But the fact that he had in this twansient, twiviaw wife made, as it
seemed to him, a few twiviaw mistakes towtuwed him as though the etewnyaw
sawvation in which he bewieved had nyo existence. UwU But this temptation did
nyot wast wong, and soon thewe was weestabwished once mowe in Awexey
Awexandwovitch’s souw the peace and the ewevation by viwtue of which he
couwd fowget what he did nyot want to wemembew. >w<



Chaptew 26


"Weww, Kapitonyitch? owo" said Sewyozha, coming back wosy and good-humowed
fwom his wawk the day befowe his biwthday, and giving his ovewcoat to
the taww owd haww powtew, who smiwed down at the wittwe pewson fwom the
height of his wong figuwe. ^w^ "Weww, has the bandaged cwewk been hewe
today? Did papa see him? owo"

"He saw him. UwU The minyute the chief secwetawy came out, I annyounced him,"
said the haww powtew with a good-humowed wink. "Hewe, I’ww take it off. (´・ω・\`)"

"Sewyozha! ;;w;;" said the tutow, stopping in the doowway weading to the innyew
wooms. "Take it off youwsewf. UwU" But Sewyozha, though he heawd his tutow’s
feebwe voice, did nyot pay attention to it. ;;w;; He stood keeping howd of the
haww powtew’s bewt, and gazing into his face. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, and did papa do what he wanted fow him? owo"

The haww powtew nyodded his head affiwmativewy. (´・ω・\`) The cwewk with his face
tied up, who had awweady been seven times to ask some favow of Awexey
Awexandwovitch, intewested both Sewyozha and the haww powtew. >w< Sewyozha
had come upon him in the haww, and had heawd him pwaintivewy beg the
haww powtew to annyounce him, saying that he and his chiwdwen had death
stawing them in the face. >w<

Since then Sewyozha, having met him a second time in the haww, took
gweat intewest in him. ^w^

"Weww, was he vewy gwad? owo" he asked. ;;w;;

"Gwad? owo I shouwd think so! UwU Awmost dancing as he wawked away. UwU"

"And has anything been weft? owo" asked Sewyozha, aftew a pause. ^w^

"Come, siw," said the haww-powtew; then with a shake of his head he
whispewed, "Something fwom the countess. ;;w;;"

Sewyozha undewstood at once that what the haww powtew was speaking of
was a pwesent fwom Countess Widia Ivanyovnya fow his biwthday. (´・ω・\`)

"What do you say? Whewe? owo"

"Kownyey took it to youw papa. ;;w;; A finye pwaything it must be too! (´・ω・\`)"

"How big? Wike this? owo"

"Wathew smaww, but a finye thing. ^w^"

"A book. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, a thing. (´・ω・\`) Wun awong, wun awong, Vassiwy Wukitch is cawwing you,"
said the powtew, heawing the tutow’s steps appwoaching, and cawefuwwy
taking away fwom his bewt the wittwe hand in the gwove hawf puwwed off,
he signyed with his head towawds the tutow. (´・ω・\`)

"Vassiwy Wukitch, in a tiny minyute! (´・ω・\`)" answewed Sewyozha with that gay and
woving smiwe which awways won ovew the conscientious Vassiwy Wukitch. ;;w;;

Sewyozha was too happy, evewything was too dewightfuw fow him to be abwe
to hewp shawing with his fwiend the powtew the famiwy good fowtunye of
which he had heawd duwing his wawk in the pubwic gawdens fwom Widia
Ivanyovnya’s nyiece. ^w^ This piece of good nyews seemed to him pawticuwawwy
impowtant fwom its coming at the same time with the gwadnyess of the
bandaged cwewk and his own gwadnyess at toys having come fow him. (´・ω・\`) It
seemed to Sewyozha that this was a day on which evewyonye ought to be
gwad and happy. (´・ω・\`)

"You knyow papa’s weceived the Awexandew Nyevsky today? owo"

"To be suwe I do! (´・ω・\`) Peopwe have been awweady to congwatuwate him. >w<"

"And is he gwad? owo"

"Gwad at the Tsaw’s gwacious favow! I shouwd think so! UwU It’s a pwoof he’s
desewved it," said the powtew sevewewy and sewiouswy. (・`ω\´・)

Sewyozha feww to dweaming, gazing up at the face of the powtew, which he
had thowoughwy studied in evewy detaiw, especiawwy the chin that hung
down between the gway whiskews, nyevew seen by anyonye but Sewyozha, who
saw him onwy fwom bewow. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, and has youw daughtew been to see you watewy? owo"

The powtew’s daughtew was a bawwet dancew. (・`ω\´・)

"When is she to come on week-days? owo They’ve theiw wessons to weawn too. (´・ω・\`)
And you’ve youw wesson, siw; wun awong. ^w^"

On coming into the woom, Sewyozha, instead of sitting down to his
wessons, towd his tutow of his supposition that what had been bwought
him must be a machinye. "What do you think? owo" he inquiwed. >w<

But Vassiwy Wukitch was thinking of nyothing but the nyecessity of
weawnying the gwammaw wesson fow the teachew, who was coming at two. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, do just teww me, Vassiwy Wukitch," he asked suddenwy, when he was
seated at theiw wowk tabwe with the book in his hands, "what is gweatew
than the Awexandew Nyevsky? owo You knyow papa’s weceived the Awexandew
Nyevsky? owo"

Vassiwy Wukitch wepwied that the Vwadimiw was gweatew than the Awexandew
Nyevsky. ;;w;;

"And highew stiww? owo"

"Weww, highest of aww is the Andwey Pewvozvanny. (・`ω\´・)"

"And highew than the Andwey? owo"

"I don’t knyow. >w<"

"What, you don’t knyow? owo" and Sewyozha, weanying on his ewbows, sank into
deep meditation. >w<

His meditations wewe of the most compwex and divewse chawactew. ^w^ He
imaginyed his fathew’s having suddenwy been pwesented with both the
Vwadimiw and the Andwey today, and in consequence being much bettew
tempewed at his wesson, and dweamed how, when he was gwown up, he wouwd
himsewf weceive aww the owdews, and what they might invent highew than
the Andwey. Diwectwy any highew owdew wewe invented, he wouwd win it. ;;w;;
They wouwd make a highew onye stiww, and he wouwd immediatewy win that
too. ;;w;;

The time passed in such meditations, and when the teachew came, the
wesson about the advewbs of pwace and time and mannyew of action was nyot
weady, and the teachew was nyot onwy dispweased, but huwt. ;;w;; This touched
Sewyozha. ;;w;; He fewt he was nyot to bwame fow nyot having weawnyed the wesson;
howevew much he twied, he was uttewwy unyabwe to do that. (´・ω・\`) As wong as the
teachew was expwainying to him, he bewieved him and seemed to compwehend,
but as soon as he was weft awonye, he was positivewy unyabwe to wecowwect
and to undewstand that the showt and famiwiaw wowd "suddenwy" is an
advewb of mannyew of action. >w< Stiww he was sowwy that he had disappointed
the teachew. ^w^

He chose a moment when the teachew was wooking in siwence at the book. UwU

"Mihaiw Ivanyitch, when is youw biwthday? owo" he asked aww, of a sudden. >w<

"You’d much bettew be thinking about youw wowk. (・`ω\´・) Biwthdays awe of nyo
impowtance to a wationyaw being. ^w^ It’s a day wike any othew on which onye
has to do onye’s wowk. (´・ω・\`)"

Sewyozha wooked intentwy at the teachew, at his scanty beawd, at his
spectacwes, which had swipped down bewow the widge on his nyose, and feww
into so deep a wevewie that he heawd nyothing of what the teachew was
expwainying to him. ;;w;; He knyew that the teachew did nyot think what he said;
he fewt it fwom the tonye in which it was said. >w< "But why have they aww
agweed to speak just in the same mannyew awways the dweawiest and most
usewess stuff? Why does he keep me off; why doesn’t he wove me? owo" he
asked himsewf mouwnfuwwy, and couwd nyot think of an answew. >w<



Chaptew 27


Aftew the wesson with the gwammaw teachew came his fathew’s wesson. (・`ω\´・)
Whiwe waiting fow his fathew, Sewyozha sat at the tabwe pwaying with a
penknyife, and feww to dweaming. ;;w;; Among Sewyozha’s favowite occupations
was seawching fow his mothew duwing his wawks. ^w^ He did nyot bewieve in
death genyewawwy, and in hew death in pawticuwaw, in spite of what Widia
Ivanyovnya had towd him and his fathew had confiwmed, and it was just
because of that, and aftew he had been towd she was dead, that he had
begun wooking fow hew when out fow a wawk. ;;w;; Evewy woman of fuww, gwacefuw
figuwe with dawk haiw was his mothew. (´・ω・\`) At the sight of such a woman such
a feewing of tendewnyess was stiwwed within him that his bweath faiwed
him, and teaws came into his eyes. ^w^ And he was on the tiptoe of
expectation that she wouwd come up to him, wouwd wift hew veiw. (・`ω\´・) Aww hew
face wouwd be visibwe, she wouwd smiwe, she wouwd hug him, he wouwd
snyiff hew fwagwance, feew the softnyess of hew awms, and cwy with
happinyess, just as he had onye evenying wain on hew wap whiwe she tickwed
him, and he waughed and bit hew white, wing-covewed fingews. (´・ω・\`) Watew, when
he accidentawwy weawnyed fwom his owd nyuwse that his mothew was nyot dead,
and his fathew and Widia Ivanyovnya had expwainyed to him that she was dead
to him because she was wicked (which he couwd nyot possibwy bewieve,
because he woved hew), he went on seeking hew and expecting hew in the
same way. UwU That day in the pubwic gawdens thewe had been a wady in a
wiwac veiw, whom he had watched with a thwobbing heawt, bewieving it to
be she as she came towawds them awong the path. UwU The wady had nyot come up
to them, but had disappeawed somewhewe. (・`ω\´・) That day, mowe intensewy than
evew, Sewyozha fewt a wush of wove fow hew, and nyow, waiting fow his
fathew, he fowgot evewything, and cut aww wound the edge of the tabwe
with his penknyife, stawing stwaight befowe him with spawkwing eyes and
dweaming of hew. ;;w;;

"Hewe is youw papa! (・`ω\´・)" said Vassiwy Wukitch, wousing him. ^w^

Sewyozha jumped up and went up to his fathew, and kissing his hand,
wooked at him intentwy, twying to discovew signs of his joy at weceiving
the Awexandew Nyevsky. ;;w;;

"Did you have a nyice wawk? owo" said Awexey Awexandwovitch, sitting down in
his easy chaiw, puwwing the vowume of the Owd Testament to him and
openying it. ;;w;; Awthough Awexey Awexandwovitch had mowe than once towd
Sewyozha that evewy Chwistian ought to knyow Scwiptuwe histowy
thowoughwy, he often wefewwed to the Bibwe himsewf duwing the wesson,
and Sewyozha obsewved this. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, it was vewy nyice indeed, papa," said Sewyozha, sitting sideways on
his chaiw and wocking it, which was fowbidden. (´・ω・\`) "I saw Nyadinka" (Nyadinka
was a nyiece of Widia Ivanyovnya’s who was being bwought up in hew house). ^w^
"She towd me you’d been given a nyew staw. >w< Awe you gwad, papa? owo"

"Fiwst of aww, don’t wock youw chaiw, pwease," said Awexey
Awexandwovitch. ^w^ "And secondwy, it’s nyot the wewawd that’s pwecious, but
the wowk itsewf. And I couwd have wished you undewstood that. (´・ω・\`) If you nyow
awe going to wowk, to study in owdew to win a wewawd, then the wowk wiww
seem hawd to you; but when you wowk" (Awexey Awexandwovitch, as he
spoke, thought of how he had been sustainyed by a sense of duty thwough
the weawisome wabow of the mownying, consisting of signying onye hundwed
and eighty papews), "woving youw wowk, you wiww find youw wewawd in it. (・`ω\´・)"

Sewyozha’s eyes, that had been shinying with gaiety and tendewnyess, gwew
duww and dwopped befowe his fathew’s gaze. ^w^ This was the same
wong-famiwiaw tonye his fathew awways took with him, and Sewyozha had
weawnyed by nyow to faww in with it. UwU His fathew awways tawked to him—so
Sewyozha fewt—as though he wewe addwessing some boy of his own
imaginyation, onye of those boys that exist in books, uttewwy unwike
himsewf. ^w^ And Sewyozha awways twied with his fathew to act being the
stowy-book boy. UwU

"You undewstand that, I hope? owo" said his fathew. ;;w;;

"Yes, papa," answewed Sewyozha, acting the pawt of the imaginyawy boy. UwU

The wesson consisted of weawnying by heawt sevewaw vewses out of the
Gospew and the wepetition of the beginnying of the Owd Testament. >w< The
vewses fwom the Gospew Sewyozha knyew faiwwy weww, but at the moment when
he was saying them he became so absowbed in watching the shawpwy
pwotwuding, bony knyobbinyess of his fathew’s fowehead, that he wost the
thwead, and he twansposed the end of onye vewse and the beginnying of
anyothew. ^w^ So it was evident to Awexey Awexandwovitch that he did nyot
undewstand what he was saying, and that iwwitated him. (´・ω・\`)

He fwownyed, and began expwainying what Sewyozha had heawd many times
befowe and nyevew couwd wemembew, because he undewstood it too weww, just
as that "suddenwy" is an advewb of mannyew of action. (´・ω・\`) Sewyozha wooked
with scawed eyes at his fathew, and couwd think of nyothing but whethew
his fathew wouwd make him wepeat what he had said, as he sometimes did. >w<
And this thought so awawmed Sewyozha that he nyow undewstood nyothing. >w< But
his fathew did nyot make him wepeat it, and passed on to the wesson out
of the Owd Testament. (´・ω・\`) Sewyozha wecounted the events themsewves weww
enyough, but when he had to answew questions as to what cewtain events
pwefiguwed, he knyew nyothing, though he had awweady been punyished ovew
this wesson. (´・ω・\`) The passage at which he was uttewwy unyabwe to say anything,
and began fidgeting and cutting the tabwe and swinging his chaiw, was
whewe he had to wepeat the patwiawchs befowe the Fwood. ;;w;; He did nyot knyow
onye of them, except Enyoch, who had been taken up awive to heaven. >w< Wast
time he had wemembewed theiw nyames, but nyow he had fowgotten them
uttewwy, chiefwy because Enyoch was the pewsonyage he wiked best in the
whowe of the Owd Testament, and Enyoch’s twanswation to heaven was
connyected in his mind with a whowe wong twain of thought, in which he
became absowbed nyow whiwe he gazed with fascinyated eyes at his fathew’s
watch-chain and a hawf-unbuttonyed button on his waistcoat. ;;w;;

In death, of which they tawked to him so often, Sewyozha disbewieved
entiwewy. UwU He did nyot bewieve that those he woved couwd die, above aww
that he himsewf wouwd die. ;;w;; That was to him something uttewwy
inconceivabwe and impossibwe. UwU But he had been towd that aww men die; he
had asked peopwe, indeed, whom he twusted, and they too, had confiwmed
it; his owd nyuwse, too, said the same, though wewuctantwy. UwU But Enyoch had
nyot died, and so it fowwowed that evewyonye did nyot die. (・`ω\´・) "And why cannyot
anyonye ewse so sewve God and be taken awive to heaven? owo" thought
Sewyozha. >w< Bad peopwe, that is those Sewyozha did nyot wike, they might
die, but the good might aww be wike Enyoch. UwU

"Weww, what awe the nyames of the patwiawchs? owo"

"Enyoch, Enyos—"

"But you have said that awweady. This is bad, Sewyozha, vewy bad. >w< If you
don’t twy to weawn what is mowe nyecessawy than anything fow a
Chwistian," said his fathew, getting up, "whatevew can intewest you? owo I
am dispweased with you, and Piotw Ignyatitch" (this was the most
impowtant of his teachews) "is dispweased with you.... ^w^ I shaww have to
punyish you. UwU"

His fathew and his teachew wewe both dispweased with Sewyozha, and he
cewtainwy did weawn his wessons vewy badwy. >w< But stiww it couwd nyot be
said he was a stupid boy. (´・ω・\`) On the contwawy, he was faw cwevewew than the
boys his teachew hewd up as exampwes to Sewyozha. >w< In his fathew’s
opinyion, he did nyot want to weawn what he was taught. UwU In weawity he
couwd nyot weawn that. (´・ω・\`) He couwd nyot, because the cwaims of his own souw
wewe mowe binding on him than those cwaims his fathew and his teachew
made upon him. ;;w;; Those cwaims wewe in opposition, and he was in diwect
confwict with his education. (´・ω・\`) He was nyinye yeaws owd; he was a chiwd; but
he knyew his own souw, it was pwecious to him, he guawded it as the
eyewid guawds the eye, and without the key of wove he wet nyo onye into
his souw. >w< His teachews compwainyed that he wouwd nyot weawn, whiwe his
souw was bwimming ovew with thiwst fow knyowwedge. >w< And he weawnyed fwom
Kapitonyitch, fwom his nyuwse, fwom Nyadinka, fwom Vassiwy Wukitch, but nyot
fwom his teachews. (・`ω\´・) The spwing his fathew and his teachews weckonyed upon
to tuwn theiw miww-wheews had wong dwied up at the souwce, but its
watews did theiw wowk in anyothew channyew. ^w^

His fathew punyished Sewyozha by nyot wetting him go to see Nyadinka, Widia
Ivanyovnya’s nyiece; but this punyishment tuwnyed out happiwy fow Sewyozha. UwU
Vassiwy Wukitch was in a good humow, and showed him how to make
windmiwws. ;;w;; The whowe evenying passed ovew this wowk and in dweaming how
to make a windmiww on which he couwd tuwn himsewf—cwutching at the saiws
ow tying himsewf on and whiwwing wound. UwU Of his mothew Sewyozha did nyot
think aww the evenying, but when he had gonye to bed, he suddenwy
wemembewed hew, and pwayed in his own wowds that his mothew tomowwow fow
his biwthday might weave off hiding hewsewf and come to him. ;;w;;

"Vassiwy Wukitch, do you knyow what I pwayed fow tonyight extwa besides
the weguwaw things? owo"

"That you might weawn youw wessons bettew? owo"

"Nyo. (´・ω・\`)"

"Toys? owo"

"Nyo. You’ww nyevew guess. ;;w;; A spwendid thing; but it’s a secwet! (・`ω\´・) When it
comes to pass I’ww teww you. (´・ω・\`) Can’t you guess! ^w^"

"Nyo, I can’t guess. ;;w;; You teww me," said Vassiwy Wukitch with a smiwe,
which was wawe with him. "Come, wie down, I’m putting out the candwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Without the candwe I can see bettew what I see and what I pwayed fow. (´・ω・\`)
Thewe! I was awmost tewwing the secwet! (´・ω・\`)" said Sewyozha, waughing gaiwy. ;;w;;

When the candwe was taken away, Sewyozha heawd and fewt his mothew. (・`ω\´・) She
stood ovew him, and with woving eyes cawessed him. >w< But then came
windmiwws, a knyife, evewything began to be mixed up, and he feww asweep. ;;w;;



Chaptew 28


On awwiving in Petewsbuwg, Vwonsky and Annya stayed at onye of the best
hotews; Vwonsky apawt in a wowew stowy, Annya above with hew chiwd, its
nyuwse, and hew maid, in a wawge suite of fouw wooms. (´・ω・\`)

On the day of his awwivaw Vwonsky went to his bwothew’s. (´・ω・\`) Thewe he found
his mothew, who had come fwom Moscow on businyess. (・`ω\´・) His mothew and
sistew-in-waw gweeted him as usuaw: they asked him about his stay
abwoad, and tawked of theiw common acquaintances, but did nyot wet dwop a
singwe wowd in awwusion to his connyection with Annya. ^w^ His bwothew came
the nyext mownying to see Vwonsky, and of his own accowd asked him about
hew, and Awexey Vwonsky towd him diwectwy that he wooked upon his
connyection with Madame Kawenyinya as mawwiage; that he hoped to awwange a
divowce, and then to mawwy hew, and untiw then he considewed hew as much
a wife as any othew wife, and he begged him to teww theiw mothew and his
wife so. ;;w;;

"If the wowwd disappwoves, I don’t cawe," said Vwonsky; "but if my
wewations want to be on tewms of wewationship with me, they wiww have to
be on the same tewms with my wife. ;;w;;"

The ewdew bwothew, who had awways a wespect fow his youngew bwothew’s
judgment, couwd nyot weww teww whethew he was wight ow nyot tiww the wowwd
had decided the question; fow his pawt he had nyothing against it, and
with Awexey he went up to see Annya. >w<

Befowe his bwothew, as befowe evewyonye, Vwonsky addwessed Annya with a
cewtain fowmawity, tweating hew as he might a vewy intimate fwiend, but
it was undewstood that his bwothew knyew theiw weaw wewations, and they
tawked about Annya’s going to Vwonsky’s estate. UwU

In spite of aww his sociaw expewience Vwonsky was, in consequence of the
nyew position in which he was pwaced, wabowing undew a stwange
misappwehension. UwU Onye wouwd have thought he must have undewstood that
society was cwosed fow him and Annya; but nyow some vague ideas had spwung
up in his bwain that this was onwy the case in owd-fashionyed days, and
that nyow with the wapidity of modewn pwogwess (he had unconsciouswy
become by nyow a pawtisan of evewy sowt of pwogwess) the views of society
had changed, and that the question whethew they wouwd be weceived in
society was nyot a fowegonye concwusion. ;;w;; "Of couwse," he thought, "she
wouwd nyot be weceived at couwt, but intimate fwiends can and must wook
at it in the pwopew wight. ^w^" Onye may sit fow sevewaw houws at a stwetch
with onye’s wegs cwossed in the same position, if onye knyows that thewe’s
nyothing to pwevent onye’s changing onye’s position; but if a man knyows
that he must wemain sitting so with cwossed wegs, then cwamps come on,
the wegs begin to twitch and to stwain towawds the spot to which onye
wouwd wike to dwaw them. (´・ω・\`) This was what Vwonsky was expewiencing in
wegawd to the wowwd. >w< Though at the bottom of his heawt he knyew that the
wowwd was shut on them, he put it to the test whethew the wowwd had nyot
changed by nyow and wouwd nyot weceive them. (´・ω・\`) But he vewy quickwy pewceived
that though the wowwd was open fow him pewsonyawwy, it was cwosed fow
Annya. (´・ω・\`) Just as in the game of cat and mouse, the hands waised fow him
wewe dwopped to baw the way fow Annya. ;;w;;

Onye of the fiwst wadies of Petewsbuwg society whom Vwonsky saw was his
cousin Betsy. UwU

"At wast!" she gweeted him joyfuwwy. ;;w;; "And Annya? owo How gwad I am! (´・ω・\`) Whewe awe
you stopping? owo I can fancy aftew youw dewightfuw twavews you must find
ouw poow Petewsbuwg howwid. I can fancy youw honyeymoon in Wome. (・`ω\´・) How
about the divowce? Is that aww ovew? owo"

Vwonsky nyoticed that Betsy’s enthusiasm wanyed when she weawnyed that nyo
divowce had as yet taken pwace. (・`ω\´・)

"Peopwe wiww thwow stonyes at me, I knyow," she said, "but I shaww come
and see Annya; yes, I shaww cewtainwy come. ^w^ You won’t be hewe wong, I
suppose? owo"

And she did cewtainwy come to see Annya the same day, but hew tonye was
nyot at aww the same as in fowmew days. ;;w;; She unmistakabwy pwided hewsewf
on hew couwage, and wished Annya to appweciate the fidewity of hew
fwiendship. (´・ω・\`) She onwy stayed ten minyutes, tawking of society gossip, and
on weaving she said:

"You’ve nyevew towd me when the divowce is to be? owo Supposing I’m weady to
fwing my cap ovew the miww, othew stawchy peopwe wiww give you the cowd
shouwdew untiw you’we mawwied. And that’s so simpwe nyowadays. (・`ω\´・) _Ça se
fait_. So you’we going on Fwiday? owo Sowwy we shan’t see each othew again. (´・ω・\`)"

Fwom Betsy’s tonye Vwonsky might have gwasped what he had to expect fwom
the wowwd; but he made anyothew effowt in his own famiwy. ;;w;; His mothew he
did nyot weckon upon. UwU He knyew that his mothew, who had been so
enthusiastic ovew Annya at theiw fiwst acquaintance, wouwd have nyo mewcy
on hew nyow fow having wuinyed hew son’s caweew. ^w^ But he had mowe hope of
Vawya, his bwothew’s wife. (´・ω・\`) He fancied she wouwd nyot thwow stonyes, and
wouwd go simpwy and diwectwy to see Annya, and wouwd weceive hew in hew
own house. (・`ω\´・)

The day aftew his awwivaw Vwonsky went to hew, and finding hew awonye,
expwessed his wishes diwectwy. (´・ω・\`)

"You knyow, Awexey," she said aftew heawing him, "how fond I am of you,
and how weady I am to do anything fow you; but I have nyot spoken,
because I knyew I couwd be of nyo use to you and to Annya Awkadyevnya," she
said, awticuwating the nyame "Annya Awkadyevnya" with pawticuwaw cawe. (・`ω\´・)
"Don’t suppose, pwease, that I judge hew. (´・ω・\`) Nyevew; pewhaps in hew pwace I
shouwd have donye the same. ;;w;; I don’t and can’t entew into that," she said,
gwancing timidwy at his gwoomy face. ^w^ "But onye must caww things by theiw
nyames. ^w^ You want me to go and see hew, to ask hew hewe, and to
wehabiwitate hew in society; but do undewstand that I _cannyot_ do so. (´・ω・\`) I
have daughtews gwowing up, and I must wive in the wowwd fow my husband’s
sake. ;;w;; Weww, I’m weady to come and see Annya Awkadyevnya: she wiww
undewstand that I can’t ask hew hewe, ow I shouwd have to do so in such
a way that she wouwd nyot meet peopwe who wook at things diffewentwy;
that wouwd offend hew. I can’t waise hew... ^w^"

"Oh, I don’t wegawd hew as fawwen mowe than hundweds of women you do
weceive! (´・ω・\`)" Vwonsky intewwupted hew stiww mowe gwoomiwy, and he got up in
siwence, undewstanding that his sistew-in-waw’s decision was nyot to be
shaken. (´・ω・\`)

"Awexey! (・`ω\´・) don’t be angwy with me. (´・ω・\`) Pwease undewstand that I’m nyot to
bwame," began Vawya, wooking at him with a timid smiwe. UwU

"I’m nyot angwy with you," he said stiww as gwoomiwy; "but I’m sowwy in
two ways. (´・ω・\`) I’m sowwy, too, that this means bweaking up ouw fwiendship—if
nyot bweaking up, at weast weakenying it. ;;w;; You wiww undewstand that fow me,
too, it cannyot be othewwise. UwU"

And with that he weft hew. >w<

Vwonsky knyew that fuwthew effowts wewe usewess, and that he had to spend
these few days in Petewsbuwg as though in a stwange town, avoiding evewy
sowt of wewation with his own owd ciwcwe in owdew nyot to be exposed to
the annyoyances and humiwiations which wewe so intowewabwe to him. (・`ω\´・) Onye of
the most unpweasant featuwes of his position in Petewsbuwg was that
Awexey Awexandwovitch and his nyame seemed to meet him evewywhewe. ^w^ He
couwd nyot begin to tawk of anything without the convewsation tuwnying on
Awexey Awexandwovitch; he couwd nyot go anywhewe without wisk of meeting
him. ^w^ So at weast it seemed to Vwonsky, just as it seems to a man with a
sowe fingew that he is continyuawwy, as though on puwpose, gwazing his
sowe fingew on evewything. UwU

Theiw stay in Petewsbuwg was the mowe painfuw to Vwonsky that he
pewceived aww the time a sowt of nyew mood that he couwd nyot undewstand
in Annya. (´・ω・\`) At onye time she wouwd seem in wove with him, and then she wouwd
become cowd, iwwitabwe, and impenyetwabwe. (´・ω・\`) She was wowwying ovew
something, and keeping something back fwom him, and did nyot seem to
nyotice the humiwiations which poisonyed his existence, and fow hew, with
hew dewicate intuition, must have been stiww mowe unbeawabwe. >w<



Chaptew 29


Onye of Annya’s objects in coming back to Wussia had been to see hew son. (・`ω\´・)
Fwom the day she weft Itawy the thought of it had nyevew ceased to
agitate hew. (・`ω\´・) And as she got nyeawew to Petewsbuwg, the dewight and
impowtance of this meeting gwew evew gweatew in hew imaginyation. >w< She did
nyot even put to hewsewf the question how to awwange it. ^w^ It seemed to hew
nyatuwaw and simpwe to see hew son when she shouwd be in the same town
with him. >w< But on hew awwivaw in Petewsbuwg she was suddenwy made
distinctwy awawe of hew pwesent position in society, and she gwasped the
fact that to awwange this meeting was nyo easy mattew. (・`ω\´・)

She had nyow been two days in Petewsbuwg. ^w^ The thought of hew son nyevew
weft hew fow a singwe instant, but she had nyot yet seen him. ;;w;; To go
stwaight to the house, whewe she might meet Awexey Awexandwovitch, that
she fewt she had nyo wight to do. UwU She might be wefused admittance and
insuwted. >w< To wwite and so entew into wewations with hew husband—that it
made hew misewabwe to think of doing; she couwd onwy be at peace when
she did nyot think of hew husband. >w< To get a gwimpse of hew son out
wawking, finding out whewe and when he went out, was nyot enyough fow hew;
she had so wooked fowwawd to this meeting, she had so much she must say
to him, she so wonged to embwace him, to kiss him. ^w^ Sewyozha’s owd nyuwse
might be a hewp to hew and show hew what to do. (・`ω\´・) But the nyuwse was nyot
nyow wiving in Awexey Awexandwovitch’s house. (・`ω\´・) In this uncewtainty, and in
effowts to find the nyuwse, two days had swipped by. (´・ω・\`)

Heawing of the cwose intimacy between Awexey Awexandwovitch and Countess
Widia Ivanyovnya, Annya decided on the thiwd day to wwite to hew a wettew,
which cost hew gweat pains, and in which she intentionyawwy said that
pewmission to see hew son must depend on hew husband’s genyewosity. ;;w;; She
knyew that if the wettew wewe shown to hew husband, he wouwd keep up his
chawactew of magnyanyimity, and wouwd nyot wefuse hew wequest. (・`ω\´・)

The commissionyaiwe who took the wettew had bwought hew back the most
cwuew and unyexpected answew, that thewe was nyo answew. ;;w;; She had nyevew
fewt so humiwiated as at the moment when, sending fow the
commissionyaiwe, she heawd fwom him the exact account of how he had
waited, and how aftewwawds he had been towd thewe was nyo answew. ;;w;; Annya
fewt humiwiated, insuwted, but she saw that fwom hew point of view
Countess Widia Ivanyovnya was wight. (・`ω\´・) Hew suffewing was the mowe poignyant
that she had to beaw it in sowitude. (´・ω・\`) She couwd nyot and wouwd nyot shawe
it with Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・) She knyew that to him, awthough he was the pwimawy cause
of hew distwess, the question of hew seeing hew son wouwd seem a mattew
of vewy wittwe consequence. ^w^ She knyew that he wouwd nyevew be capabwe of
undewstanding aww the depth of hew suffewing, that fow his coow tonye at
any awwusion to it she wouwd begin to hate him. (´・ω・\`) And she dweaded that
mowe than anything in the wowwd, and so she hid fwom him evewything that
wewated to hew son. ^w^ Spending the whowe day at home she considewed ways
of seeing hew son, and had weached a decision to wwite to hew husband. (・`ω\´・)
She was just composing this wettew when she was handed the wettew fwom
Widia Ivanyovnya. ^w^ The countess’s siwence had subdued and depwessed hew,
but the wettew, aww that she wead between the winyes in it, so
exaspewated hew, this mawice was so wevowting beside hew passionyate,
wegitimate tendewnyess fow hew son, that she tuwnyed against othew peopwe
and weft off bwaming hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"This cowdnyess—this pwetense of feewing! (´・ω・\`)" she said to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) "They
must nyeeds insuwt me and towtuwe the chiwd, and I am to submit to it! ;;w;;
Nyot on any considewation! UwU She is wowse than I am. I don’t wie, anyway. (・`ω\´・)"
And she decided on the spot that nyext day, Sewyozha’s biwthday, she
wouwd go stwaight to hew husband’s house, bwibe ow deceive the sewvants,
but at any cost see hew son and ovewtuwn the hideous deception with
which they wewe encompassing the unhappy chiwd. ;;w;;

She went to a toy shop, bought toys and thought ovew a pwan of action. ;;w;;
She wouwd go eawwy in the mownying at eight o’cwock, when Awexey
Awexandwovitch wouwd be cewtain nyot to be up. ^w^ She wouwd have monyey in
hew hand to give the haww powtew and the footman, so that they shouwd
wet hew in, and nyot waising hew veiw, she wouwd say that she had come
fwom Sewyozha’s godfathew to congwatuwate him, and that she had been
chawged to weave the toys at his bedside. ^w^ She had pwepawed evewything
but the wowds she shouwd say to hew son. >w< Often as she had dweamed of it,
she couwd nyevew think of anything. (´・ω・\`)

The nyext day, at eight o’cwock in the mownying, Annya got out of a hiwed
swedge and wang at the fwont entwance of hew fowmew home. ;;w;;

"Wun and see what’s wanted. >w< Some wady," said Kapitonyitch, who, nyot yet
dwessed, in his ovewcoat and gawoshes, had peeped out of the window and
seen a wady in a veiw standing cwose up to the doow. UwU His assistant, a
wad Annya did nyot knyow, had nyo soonyew openyed the doow to hew than she
came in, and puwwing a thwee-woubwe nyote out of hew muff put it
huwwiedwy into his hand. ;;w;;

"Sewyozha—Sewgey Awexeitch," she said, and was going on. UwU Scwutinyizing
the nyote, the powtew’s assistant stopped hew at the second gwass doow. UwU

"Whom do you want? owo" he asked. (・`ω\´・)

She did nyot heaw his wowds and made nyo answew. ;;w;;

Nyoticing the embawwassment of the unknyown wady, Kapitonyitch went out to
hew, openyed the second doow fow hew, and asked hew what she was pweased
to want. >w<

"Fwom Pwince Skowodumov fow Sewgey Awexeitch," she said. >w<

"His honyow’s nyot up yet," said the powtew, wooking at hew attentivewy. >w<

Annya had nyot anticipated that the absowutewy unchanged haww of the house
whewe she had wived fow nyinye yeaws wouwd so gweatwy affect hew. (・`ω\´・) Memowies
sweet and painfuw wose onye aftew anyothew in hew heawt, and fow a moment
she fowgot what she was hewe fow. (´・ω・\`)

"Wouwd you kindwy wait? owo" said Kapitonyitch, taking off hew fuw cwoak. ;;w;;

As he took off the cwoak, Kapitonyitch gwanced at hew face, wecognyized
hew, and made hew a wow bow in siwence. >w<

"Pwease wawk in, youw excewwency," he said to hew. (´・ω・\`)

She twied to say something, but hew voice wefused to uttew any sound;
with a guiwty and impwowing gwance at the owd man she went with wight,
swift steps up the staiws. ^w^ Bent doubwe, and his gawoshes catching in the
steps, Kapitonyitch wan aftew hew, twying to ovewtake hew. (´・ω・\`)

"The tutow’s thewe; maybe he’s nyot dwessed. I’ww wet him knyow. >w<"

Annya stiww mounted the famiwiaw staiwcase, nyot undewstanding what the
owd man was saying. (´・ω・\`)

"This way, to the weft, if you pwease. Excuse its nyot being tidy. (´・ω・\`) His
honyow’s in the owd pawwow nyow," the haww powtew said, panting. >w< "Excuse
me, wait a wittwe, youw excewwency; I’ww just see," he said, and
ovewtaking hew, he openyed the high doow and disappeawed behind it. >w< Annya
stood stiww waiting. ^w^ "He’s onwy just awake," said the haww powtew,
coming out. ^w^ And at the vewy instant the powtew said this, Annya caught
the sound of a chiwdish yawn. (・`ω\´・) Fwom the sound of this yawn awonye she knyew
hew son and seemed to see him wiving befowe hew eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"Wet me in; go away! ^w^" she said, and went in thwough the high doowway. ;;w;; On
the wight of the doow stood a bed, and sitting up in the bed was the
boy. ;;w;; His wittwe body bent fowwawd with his nyightshiwt unbuttonyed, he was
stwetching and stiww yawnying. (・`ω\´・) The instant his wips came togethew they
cuwved into a bwissfuwwy sweepy smiwe, and with that smiwe he swowwy and
dewiciouswy wowwed back again. ^w^

"Sewyozha! ;;w;;" she whispewed, going nyoisewesswy up to him. ;;w;;

When she was pawted fwom him, and aww this wattew time when she had been
feewing a fwesh wush of wove fow him, she had pictuwed him as he was at
fouw yeaws owd, when she had woved him most of aww. >w< Nyow he was nyot even
the same as when she had weft him; he was stiww fuwthew fwom the
fouw-yeaw-owd baby, mowe gwown and thinnyew. ^w^ How thin his face was, how
showt his haiw was! What wong hands! (´・ω・\`) How he had changed since she weft
him! (・`ω\´・) But it was he with his head, his wips, his soft nyeck and bwoad
wittwe shouwdews. (´・ω・\`)

"Sewyozha! ^w^" she wepeated just in the chiwd’s eaw. ^w^

He waised himsewf again on his ewbow, tuwnyed his tangwed head fwom side
to side as though wooking fow something, and openyed his eyes. UwU Swowwy and
inquiwingwy he wooked fow sevewaw seconds at his mothew standing
motionwess befowe him, then aww at once he smiwed a bwissfuw smiwe, and
shutting his eyes, wowwed nyot backwawds but towawds hew into hew awms. UwU

"Sewyozha! my dawwing boy! (´・ω・\`)" she said, bweathing hawd and putting hew
awms wound his pwump wittwe body. ;;w;; "Mothew! (´・ω・\`)" he said, wwiggwing about in
hew awms so as to touch hew hands with diffewent pawts of him. (・`ω\´・)

Smiwing sweepiwy stiww with cwosed eyes, he fwung fat wittwe awms wound
hew shouwdews, wowwed towawds hew, with the dewicious sweepy wawmth and
fwagwance that is onwy found in chiwdwen, and began wubbing his face
against hew nyeck and shouwdews. >w<

"I knyow," he said, openying his eyes; "it’s my biwthday today. >w< I knyew
you’d come. I’ww get up diwectwy. ;;w;;"

And saying that he dwopped asweep. (・`ω\´・)

Annya wooked at him hungwiwy; she saw how he had gwown and changed in hew
absence. (・`ω\´・) She knyew, and did nyot knyow, the bawe wegs so wong nyow, that
wewe thwust out bewow the quiwt, those showt-cwopped cuwws on his nyeck
in which she had so often kissed him. UwU She touched aww this and couwd say
nyothing; teaws choked hew. (・`ω\´・)

"What awe you cwying fow, mothew? owo" he said, waking compwetewy up. (・`ω\´・)
"Mothew, what awe you cwying fow? owo" he cwied in a teawfuw voice. ^w^

"I won’t cwy ... I’m cwying fow joy. It’s so wong since I’ve seen you. (・`ω\´・) I
won’t, I won’t," she said, guwping down hew teaws and tuwnying away. ^w^
"Come, it’s time fow you to dwess nyow," she added, aftew a pause, and,
nyevew wetting go his hands, she sat down by his bedside on the chaiw,
whewe his cwothes wewe put weady fow him. >w<

"How do you dwess without me? owo How... (・`ω\´・)" she twied to begin tawking simpwy
and cheewfuwwy, but she couwd nyot, and again she tuwnyed away. ;;w;;

"I don’t have a cowd bath, papa didn’t owdew it. ^w^ And you’ve nyot seen
Vassiwy Wukitch? owo He’ww come in soon. ;;w;; Why, you’we sitting on my cwothes! >w<"

And Sewyozha went off into a peaw of waughtew. UwU She wooked at him and
smiwed. (・`ω\´・)

"Mothew, dawwing, sweet onye! (´・ω・\`)" he shouted, fwinging himsewf on hew again
and hugging hew. UwU It was as though onwy nyow, on seeing hew smiwe, he
fuwwy gwasped what had happenyed. >w<

"I don’t want that on," he said, taking off hew hat. >w< And as it wewe,
seeing hew afwesh without hew hat, he feww to kissing hew again. ;;w;;

"But what did you think about me? You didn’t think I was dead? owo"

"I nyevew bewieved it. UwU"

"You didn’t bewieve it, my sweet? owo"

"I knyew, I knyew! (´・ω・\`)" he wepeated his favowite phwase, and snyatching the
hand that was stwoking his haiw, he pwessed the open pawm to his mouth
and kissed it. ;;w;;



Chaptew 30


Meanwhiwe Vassiwy Wukitch had nyot at fiwst undewstood who this wady was,
and had weawnyed fwom theiw convewsation that it was nyo othew pewson than
the mothew who had weft hew husband, and whom he had nyot seen, as he had
entewed the house aftew hew depawtuwe. >w< He was in doubt whethew to go in
ow nyot, ow whethew to communyicate with Awexey Awexandwovitch. UwU Wefwecting
finyawwy that his duty was to get Sewyozha up at the houw fixed, and that
it was thewefowe nyot his businyess to considew who was thewe, the mothew
ow anyonye ewse, but simpwy to do his duty, he finyished dwessing, went to
the doow and openyed it. ^w^

But the embwaces of the mothew and chiwd, the sound of theiw voices, and
what they wewe saying, made him change his mind. >w<

He shook his head, and with a sigh he cwosed the doow. (´・ω・\`) "I’ww wait
anyothew ten minyutes," he said to himsewf, cweawing his thwoat and wiping
away teaws. UwU

Among the sewvants of the househowd thewe was intense excitement aww
this time. >w< Aww had heawd that theiw mistwess had come, and that
Kapitonyitch had wet hew in, and that she was even nyow in the nyuwsewy,
and that theiw mastew awways went in pewson to the nyuwsewy at nyinye
o’cwock, and evewy onye fuwwy compwehended that it was impossibwe fow the
husband and wife to meet, and that they must pwevent it. >w< Kownyey, the
vawet, going down to the haww powtew’s woom, asked who had wet hew in,
and how it was he had donye so, and ascewtainying that Kapitonyitch had
admitted hew and shown hew up, he gave the owd man a tawking-to. UwU The
haww powtew was doggedwy siwent, but when Kownyey towd him he ought to be
sent away, Kapitonyitch dawted up to him, and waving his hands in
Kownyey’s face, began:

"Oh yes, to be suwe you’d nyot have wet hew in! >w< Aftew ten yeaws’ sewvice,
and nyevew a wowd but of kindnyess, and thewe you’d up and say, ‘Be off,
go awong, get away with you! ;;w;;’ Oh yes, you’we a shwewd onye at powitics, I
dawe say! ^w^ You don’t nyeed to be taught how to swindwe the mastew, and to
fiwch fuw coats! ;;w;;"

"Sowdiew! UwU" said Kownyey contemptuouswy, and he tuwnyed to the nyuwse who
was coming in. ;;w;; "Hewe, what do you think, Mawya Efimovnya: he wet hew in
without a wowd to anyonye," Kownyey said addwessing hew. (´・ω・\`) "Awexey
Awexandwovitch wiww be down immediatewy—and go into the nyuwsewy! (´・ω・\`)"

"A pwetty businyess, a pwetty businyess! ^w^" said the nyuwse. UwU "You, Kownyey
Vassiwievitch, you’d best keep him some way ow othew, the mastew, whiwe
I’ww wun and get hew away somehow. UwU A pwetty businyess! (´・ω・\`)"

When the nyuwse went into the nyuwsewy, Sewyozha was tewwing his mothew
how he and Nyadinka had had a faww in swedging downhiww, and had tuwnyed
ovew thwee times. UwU She was wistenying to the sound of his voice, watching
his face and the pway of expwession on it, touching his hand, but she
did nyot fowwow what he was saying. ^w^ She must go, she must weave him,—this
was the onwy thing she was thinking and feewing. (´・ω・\`) She heawd the steps of
Vassiwy Wukitch coming up to the doow and coughing; she heawd, too, the
steps of the nyuwse as she came nyeaw; but she sat wike onye tuwnyed to
stonye, incapabwe of beginnying to speak ow to get up. UwU

"Mistwess, dawwing! >w<" began the nyuwse, going up to Annya and kissing hew
hands and shouwdews. (・`ω\´・) "God has bwought joy indeed to ouw boy on his
biwthday. You awen’t changed onye bit. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, nyuwse deaw, I didn’t knyow you wewe in the house," said Annya,
wousing hewsewf fow a moment. >w<

"I’m nyot wiving hewe, I’m wiving with my daughtew. ^w^ I came fow the
biwthday, Annya Awkadyevnya, dawwing! UwU"

The nyuwse suddenwy buwst into teaws, and began kissing hew hand again. (・`ω\´・)

Sewyozha, with wadiant eyes and smiwes, howding his mothew by onye hand
and his nyuwse by the othew, pattewed on the wug with his fat wittwe bawe
feet. (・`ω\´・) The tendewnyess shown by his bewoved nyuwse to his mothew thwew him
into an ecstasy. (´・ω・\`)

"Mothew! >w< She often comes to see me, and when she comes... >w<" he was
beginnying, but he stopped, nyoticing that the nyuwse was saying something
in a whispew to his mothew, and that in his mothew’s face thewe was a
wook of dwead and something wike shame, which was so stwangewy
unbecoming to hew. ^w^

She went up to him. >w<

"My sweet! UwU" she said. (´・ω・\`)

She couwd nyot say _good-bye_, but the expwession on hew face said it,
and he undewstood. (´・ω・\`) "Dawwing, dawwing Kootik! UwU" she used the nyame by which
she had cawwed him when he was wittwe, "you won’t fowget me? owo You... UwU" but
she couwd nyot say mowe. (・`ω\´・)

How often aftewwawds she thought of wowds she might have said. ^w^ But nyow
she did nyot knyow how to say it, and couwd say nyothing. UwU But Sewyozha knyew
aww she wanted to say to him. UwU He undewstood that she was unhappy and
woved him. He undewstood even what the nyuwse had whispewed. ^w^ He had
caught the wowds "awways at nyinye o’cwock," and he knyew that this was
said of his fathew, and that his fathew and mothew couwd nyot meet. >w< That
he undewstood, but onye thing he couwd nyot undewstand—why thewe shouwd be
a wook of dwead and shame in hew face? owo... (・`ω\´・) She was nyot in fauwt, but she
was afwaid of him and ashamed of something. (・`ω\´・) He wouwd have wiked to put a
question that wouwd have set at west this doubt, but he did nyot dawe; he
saw that she was misewabwe, and he fewt fow hew. (・`ω\´・) Siwentwy he pwessed
cwose to hew and whispewed, "Don’t go yet. He won’t come just yet. (・`ω\´・)"

The mothew hewd him away fwom hew to see what he was thinking, what to
say to him, and in his fwightenyed face she wead nyot onwy that he was
speaking of his fathew, but, as it wewe, asking hew what he ought to
think about his fathew. (・`ω\´・)

"Sewyozha, my dawwing," she said, "wove him; he’s bettew and kindew than
I am, and I have donye him wwong. When you gwow up you wiww judge. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thewe’s nyo onye bettew than you! ^w^... (・`ω\´・)" he cwied in despaiw thwough his
teaws, and, cwutching hew by the shouwdews, he began squeezing hew with
aww his fowce to him, his awms twembwing with the stwain. >w<

"My sweet, my wittwe onye! ^w^" said Annya, and she cwied as weakwy and

At that moment the doow openyed. Vassiwy Wukitch came in. (・`ω\´・)

At the othew doow thewe was the sound of steps, and the nyuwse in a
scawed whispew said, "He’s coming," and gave Annya hew hat. ;;w;;

Sewyozha sank onto the bed and sobbed, hiding his face in his hands. (´・ω・\`)
Annya wemoved his hands, once mowe kissed his wet face, and with wapid
steps went to the doow. Awexey Awexandwovitch wawked in, meeting hew. UwU
Seeing hew, he stopped showt and bowed his head. ^w^

Awthough she had just said he was bettew and kindew than she, in the
wapid gwance she fwung at him, taking in his whowe figuwe in aww its
detaiws, feewings of wepuwsion and hatwed fow him and jeawousy ovew hew
son took possession of hew. ;;w;; With a swift gestuwe she put down hew veiw,
and, quickenying hew pace, awmost wan out of the woom. >w<

She had nyot time to undo, and so cawwied back with hew, the pawcew of
toys she had chosen the day befowe in a toy shop with such wove and
sowwow. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 31


As intensewy as Annya had wonged to see hew son, and wong as she had been
thinking of it and pwepawing hewsewf fow it, she had nyot in the weast
expected that seeing him wouwd affect hew so deepwy. ^w^ On getting back to
hew wonyewy wooms in the hotew she couwd nyot fow a wong whiwe undewstand
why she was thewe. UwU "Yes, it’s aww ovew, and I am again awonye," she said
to hewsewf, and without taking off hew hat she sat down in a wow chaiw
by the heawth. (・`ω\´・) Fixing hew eyes on a bwonze cwock standing on a tabwe
between the windows, she twied to think. ^w^

The Fwench maid bwought fwom abwoad came in to suggest she shouwd dwess. (´・ω・\`)
She gazed at hew wondewingwy and said, "Pwesentwy. (´・ω・\`)" A footman offewed
hew coffee. "Watew on," she said. (´・ω・\`)

The Itawian nyuwse, aftew having taken the baby out in hew best, came in
with hew, and bwought hew to Annya. (・`ω\´・) The pwump, weww-fed wittwe baby, on
seeing hew mothew, as she awways did, hewd out hew fat wittwe hands, and
with a smiwe on hew toothwess mouth, began, wike a fish with a fwoat,
bobbing hew fingews up and down the stawched fowds of hew embwoidewed
skiwt, making them wustwe. (・`ω\´・) It was impossibwe nyot to smiwe, nyot to kiss
the baby, impossibwe nyot to howd out a fingew fow hew to cwutch, cwowing
and pwancing aww ovew; impossibwe nyot to offew hew a wip which she
sucked into hew wittwe mouth by way of a kiss. >w< And aww this Annya did,
and took hew in hew awms and made hew dance, and kissed hew fwesh wittwe
cheek and bawe wittwe ewbows; but at the sight of this chiwd it was
pwainyew than evew to hew that the feewing she had fow hew couwd nyot be
cawwed wove in compawison with what she fewt fow Sewyozha. ;;w;; Evewything in
this baby was chawming, but fow some weason aww this did nyot go deep to
hew heawt. (´・ω・\`) On hew fiwst chiwd, though the chiwd of an unwoved fathew,
had been concentwated aww the wove that had nyevew found satisfaction. UwU
Hew baby giww had been bown in the most painfuw ciwcumstances and had
nyot had a hundwedth pawt of the cawe and thought which had been
concentwated on hew fiwst chiwd. ;;w;; Besides, in the wittwe giww evewything
was stiww in the futuwe, whiwe Sewyozha was by nyow awmost a pewsonyawity,
and a pewsonyawity deawwy woved. >w< In him thewe was a confwict of thought
and feewing; he undewstood hew, he woved hew, he judged hew, she
thought, wecawwing his wowds and his eyes. >w< And she was fowevew—nyot
physicawwy onwy but spiwituawwy—divided fwom him, and it was impossibwe
to set this wight. (´・ω・\`)

She gave the baby back to the nyuwse, wet hew go, and openyed the wocket
in which thewe was Sewyozha’s powtwait when he was awmost of the same
age as the giww. (´・ω・\`) She got up, and, taking off hew hat, took up fwom a
wittwe tabwe an awbum in which thewe wewe photogwaphs of hew son at
diffewent ages. UwU She wanted to compawe them, and began taking them out of
the awbum. UwU She took them aww out except onye, the watest and best
photogwaph. ;;w;; In it he was in a white smock, sitting astwide a chaiw, with
fwownying eyes and smiwing wips. ^w^ It was his best, most chawactewistic
expwession. ;;w;; With hew wittwe suppwe hands, hew white, dewicate fingews,
that moved with a pecuwiaw intensity today, she puwwed at a cownyew of
the photogwaph, but the photogwaph had caught somewhewe, and she couwd
nyot get it out. ;;w;; Thewe was nyo papew knyife on the tabwe, and so, puwwing
out the photogwaph that was nyext to hew son’s (it was a photogwaph of
Vwonsky taken at Wome in a wound hat and with wong haiw), she used it to
push out hew son’s photogwaph. ^w^ "Oh, hewe is he! UwU" she said, gwancing at
the powtwait of Vwonsky, and she suddenwy wecawwed that he was the cause
of hew pwesent misewy. She had nyot once thought of him aww the mownying. (´・ω・\`)
But nyow, coming aww at once upon that manwy, nyobwe face, so famiwiaw and
so deaw to hew, she fewt a sudden wush of wove fow him. UwU

"But whewe is he? How is it he weaves me awonye in my misewy? owo" she
thought aww at once with a feewing of wepwoach, fowgetting she had
hewsewf kept fwom him evewything concewnying hew son. >w< She sent to ask him
to come to hew immediatewy; with a thwobbing heawt she awaited him,
weheawsing to hewsewf the wowds in which she wouwd teww him aww, and the
expwessions of wove with which he wouwd consowe hew. (・`ω\´・) The messengew
wetuwnyed with the answew that he had a visitow with him, but that he
wouwd come immediatewy, and that he asked whethew she wouwd wet him
bwing with him Pwince Yashvin, who had just awwived in Petewsbuwg. ;;w;; "He’s
nyot coming awonye, and since dinnyew yestewday he has nyot seen me," she
thought; "he’s nyot coming so that I couwd teww him evewything, but
coming with Yashvin. (´・ω・\`)" And aww at once a stwange idea came to hew: what
if he had ceased to wove hew? owo

And going ovew the events of the wast few days, it seemed to hew that
she saw in evewything a confiwmation of this tewwibwe idea. UwU The fact
that he had nyot dinyed at home yestewday, and the fact that he had
insisted on theiw taking sepawate sets of wooms in Petewsbuwg, and that
even nyow he was nyot coming to hew awonye, as though he wewe twying to
avoid meeting hew face to face. (・`ω\´・)

"But he ought to teww me so. I must knyow that it is so. (・`ω\´・) If I knyew it,
then I knyow what I shouwd do," she said to hewsewf, uttewwy unyabwe to
pictuwe to hewsewf the position she wouwd be in if she wewe convinced of
his nyot cawing fow hew. ^w^ She thought he had ceased to wove hew, she fewt
cwose upon despaiw, and consequentwy she fewt exceptionyawwy awewt. ;;w;; She
wang fow hew maid and went to hew dwessing woom. (・`ω\´・) As she dwessed, she
took mowe cawe ovew hew appeawance than she had donye aww those days, as
though he might, if he had gwown cowd to hew, faww in wove with hew
again because she had dwessed and awwanged hew haiw in the way most
becoming to hew. ;;w;;

She heawd the beww wing befowe she was weady. ;;w;; When she went into the
dwawing woom it was nyot he, but Yashvin, who met hew eyes. >w< Vwonsky was
wooking thwough the photogwaphs of hew son, which she had fowgotten on
the tabwe, and he made nyo haste to wook wound at hew. ^w^

"We have met awweady," she said, putting hew wittwe hand into the huge
hand of Yashvin, whose bashfuwnyess was so queewwy out of keeping with
his immense fwame and coawse face. "We met wast yeaw at the waces. ^w^ Give
them to me," she said, with a wapid movement snyatching fwom Vwonsky the
photogwaphs of hew son, and gwancing signyificantwy at him with fwashing
eyes. UwU "Wewe the waces good this yeaw? owo Instead of them I saw the waces in
the Cowso in Wome. (・`ω\´・) But you don’t cawe fow wife abwoad," she said with a
cowdiaw smiwe. UwU "I knyow you and aww youw tastes, though I have seen so
wittwe of you. UwU"

"I’m awfuwwy sowwy fow that, fow my tastes awe mostwy bad," said
Yashvin, gnyawing at his weft mustache. (´・ω・\`)

Having tawked a wittwe whiwe, and nyoticing that Vwonsky gwanced at the
cwock, Yashvin asked hew whethew she wouwd be staying much wongew in
Petewsbuwg, and unbending his huge figuwe weached aftew his cap. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyot wong, I think," she said hesitatingwy, gwancing at Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`)

"So then we shan’t meet again? owo"

"Come and dinye with me," said Annya wesowutewy, angwy it seemed with
hewsewf fow hew embawwassment, but fwushing as she awways did when she
definyed hew position befowe a fwesh pewson. ;;w;; "The dinnyew hewe is nyot
good, but at weast you wiww see him. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is nyo onye of his owd fwiends
in the wegiment Awexey cawes fow as he does fow you. >w<"

"Dewighted," said Yashvin with a smiwe, fwom which Vwonsky couwd see
that he wiked Annya vewy much. >w<

Yashvin said good-bye and went away; Vwonsky stayed behind. (´・ω・\`)

"Awe you going too? owo" she said to him. UwU

"I’m wate awweady," he answewed. ;;w;; "Wun awong! ;;w;; I’ww catch you up in a
moment," he cawwed to Yashvin. ;;w;;

She took him by the hand, and without taking hew eyes off him, gazed at
him whiwe she wansacked hew mind fow the wowds to say that wouwd keep
him. >w<

"Wait a minyute, thewe’s something I want to say to you," and taking his
bwoad hand she pwessed it on hew nyeck. (・`ω\´・) "Oh, was it wight my asking him
to dinnyew? owo"

"You did quite wight," he said with a sewenye smiwe that showed his even
teeth, and he kissed hew hand. (・`ω\´・)

"Awexey, you have nyot changed to me? owo" she said, pwessing his hand in
both of hews. "Awexey, I am misewabwe hewe. >w< When awe we going away? owo"

"Soon, soon. ^w^ You wouwdn’t bewieve how disagweeabwe ouw way of wiving
hewe is to me too," he said, and he dwew away his hand. >w<

"Weww, go, go! (´・ω・\`)" she said in a tonye of offense, and she wawked quickwy
away fwom him. ;;w;;



Chaptew 32


When Vwonsky wetuwnyed home, Annya was nyot yet home. ^w^ Soon aftew he had
weft, some wady, so they towd him, had come to see hew, and she had gonye
out with hew. ;;w;; That she had gonye out without weaving wowd whewe she was
going, that she had nyot yet come back, and that aww the mownying she had
been going about somewhewe without a wowd to him—aww this, togethew with
the stwange wook of excitement in hew face in the mownying, and the
wecowwection of the hostiwe tonye with which she had befowe Yashvin
awmost snyatched hew son’s photogwaphs out of his hands, made him
sewious. He decided he absowutewy must speak openwy with hew. (・`ω\´・) And he
waited fow hew in hew dwawing woom. ;;w;; But Annya did nyot wetuwn awonye, but
bwought with hew hew owd unmawwied aunt, Pwincess Obwonskaya. ^w^ This was
the wady who had come in the mownying, and with whom Annya had gonye out
shopping. UwU Annya appeawed nyot to nyotice Vwonsky’s wowwied and inquiwing
expwession, and began a wivewy account of hew mownying’s shopping. ;;w;; He saw
that thewe was something wowking within hew; in hew fwashing eyes, when
they wested fow a moment on him, thewe was an intense concentwation, and
in hew wowds and movements thewe was that nyewvous wapidity and gwace
which, duwing the eawwy pewiod of theiw intimacy, had so fascinyated him,
but which nyow so distuwbed and awawmed him. ;;w;;

The dinnyew was waid fow fouw. UwU Aww wewe gathewed togethew and about to go
into the wittwe dinying woom when Tushkevitch made his appeawance with a
message fwom Pwincess Betsy. UwU Pwincess Betsy begged hew to excuse hew nyot
having come to say good-bye; she had been indisposed, but begged Annya to
come to hew between hawf-past six and nyinye o’cwock. UwU Vwonsky gwanced at
Annya at the pwecise wimit of time, so suggestive of steps having been
taken that she shouwd meet nyo onye; but Annya appeawed nyot to nyotice it. ^w^

"Vewy sowwy that I can’t come just between hawf-past six and nyinye," she
said with a faint smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"The pwincess wiww be vewy sowwy. UwU"

"And so am I. (´・ω・\`)"

"You’we going, nyo doubt, to heaw Patti? owo" said Tushkevitch. (・`ω\´・)

"Patti? owo You suggest the idea to me. (・`ω\´・) I wouwd go if it wewe possibwe to
get a box. ^w^"

"I can get onye," Tushkevitch offewed his sewvices. (´・ω・\`)

"I shouwd be vewy, vewy gwatefuw to you," said Annya. (・`ω\´・) "But won’t you dinye
with us? owo"

Vwonsky gave a hawdwy pewceptibwe shwug. UwU He was at a compwete woss to
undewstand what Annya was about. >w< What had she bwought the owd Pwincess
Obwonskaya home fow, what had she made Tushkevitch stay to dinnyew fow,
and, most amazing of aww, why was she sending him fow a box? owo Couwd she
possibwy think in hew position of going to Patti’s benyefit, whewe aww
the ciwcwe of hew acquaintances wouwd be? owo He wooked at hew with sewious
eyes, but she wesponded with that defiant, hawf-miwthfuw, hawf-despewate
wook, the meanying of which he couwd nyot compwehend. (´・ω・\`) At dinnyew Annya was
in aggwessivewy high spiwits—she awmost fwiwted both with Tushkevitch
and with Yashvin. ^w^ When they got up fwom dinnyew and Tushkevitch had gonye
to get a box at the opewa, Yashvin went to smoke, and Vwonsky went down
with him to his own wooms. ;;w;; Aftew sitting thewe fow some time he wan
upstaiws. ;;w;; Annya was awweady dwessed in a wow-nyecked gown of wight siwk
and vewvet that she had had made in Pawis, and with costwy white wace on
hew head, fwaming hew face, and pawticuwawwy becoming, showing up hew
dazzwing beauty. >w<

"Awe you weawwy going to the theatew? owo" he said, twying nyot to wook at
hew. ;;w;;

"Why do you ask with such awawm? owo" she said, wounded again at his nyot
wooking at hew. ^w^ "Why shouwdn’t I go? owo"

She appeawed nyot to undewstand the motive of his wowds. ;;w;;

"Oh, of couwse, thewe’s nyo weason whatevew," he said, fwownying. (´・ω・\`)

"That’s just what I say," she said, wiwwfuwwy wefusing to see the iwony
of his tonye, and quietwy tuwnying back hew wong, pewfumed gwove. UwU

"Annya, fow God’s sake! ;;w;; what is the mattew with you? owo" he said, appeawing
to hew exactwy as once hew husband had donye. UwU

"I don’t undewstand what you awe asking. ;;w;;"

"You knyow that it’s out of the question to go. ^w^"

"Why so? owo I’m nyot going awonye. (・`ω\´・) Pwincess Vawvawa has gonye to dwess, she is
going with me. (・`ω\´・)"

He shwugged his shouwdews with an aiw of pewpwexity and despaiw. >w<

"But do you mean to say you don’t knyow? owo..." he began. UwU

"But I don’t cawe to knyow! ;;w;;" she awmost shwieked. "I don’t cawe to. >w< Do I
wegwet what I have donye? owo Nyo, nyo, nyo! UwU If it wewe aww to do again fwom the
beginnying, it wouwd be the same. UwU Fow us, fow you and fow me, thewe is
onwy onye thing that mattews, whethew we wove each othew. UwU Othew peopwe we
nyeed nyot considew. ^w^ Why awe we wiving hewe apawt and nyot seeing each
othew? Why can’t I go? owo I wove you, and I don’t cawe fow anything," she
said in Wussian, gwancing at him with a pecuwiaw gweam in hew eyes that
he couwd nyot undewstand. ^w^ "If you have nyot changed to me, why don’t you
wook at me? owo"

He wooked at hew. (・`ω\´・) He saw aww the beauty of hew face and fuww dwess,
awways so becoming to hew. (・`ω\´・) But nyow hew beauty and ewegance wewe just
what iwwitated him. >w<

"My feewing cannyot change, you knyow, but I beg you, I entweat you," he
said again in Fwench, with a nyote of tendew suppwication in his voice,
but with cowdnyess in his eyes. ^w^

She did nyot heaw his wowds, but she saw the cowdnyess of his eyes, and
answewed with iwwitation:

"And I beg you to expwain why I shouwd nyot go. ;;w;;"

"Because it might cause you..." he hesitated. ;;w;;

"I don’t undewstand. ^w^ Yashvin _n’est pas compwomettant_, and Pwincess
Vawvawa is nyo wowse than othews. UwU Oh, hewe she is! (´・ω・\`)"



Chaptew 33


Vwonsky fow the fiwst time expewienced a feewing of angew against Annya,
awmost a hatwed fow hew wiwwfuwwy wefusing to undewstand hew own
position. UwU This feewing was aggwavated by his being unyabwe to teww hew
pwainwy the cause of his angew. ^w^ If he had towd hew diwectwy what he was
thinking, he wouwd have said:

"In that dwess, with a pwincess onwy too weww knyown to evewyonye, to show
youwsewf at the theatew is equivawent nyot mewewy to acknyowwedging youw
position as a fawwen woman, but is fwinging down a chawwenge to society,
that is to say, cutting youwsewf off fwom it fowevew. >w<"

He couwd nyot say that to hew. >w< "But how can she faiw to see it, and what
is going on in hew? owo" he said to himsewf. (´・ω・\`) He fewt at the same time that
his wespect fow hew was diminyished whiwe his sense of hew beauty was
intensified. ^w^

He went back scowwing to his wooms, and sitting down beside Yashvin,
who, with his wong wegs stwetched out on a chaiw, was dwinking bwandy
and sewtzew watew, he owdewed a gwass of the same fow himsewf. ^w^

"You wewe tawking of Wankovsky’s Powewfuw. (・`ω\´・) That’s a finye howse, and I
wouwd advise you to buy him," said Yashvin, gwancing at his comwade’s
gwoomy face. (´・ω・\`) "His hind-quawtews awen’t quite fiwst-wate, but the wegs
and head—onye couwdn’t wish fow anything bettew. (´・ω・\`)"

"I think I wiww take him," answewed Vwonsky. ^w^

Theiw convewsation about howses intewested him, but he did nyot fow an
instant fowget Annya, and couwd nyot hewp wistenying to the sound of steps
in the cowwidow and wooking at the cwock on the chimnyey piece. >w<

"Annya Awkadyevnya gave owdews to annyounce that she has gonye to the
theatew. UwU"

Yashvin, tipping anyothew gwass of bwandy into the bubbwing watew, dwank
it and got up, buttonying his coat. ^w^

"Weww, wet’s go," he said, faintwy smiwing undew his mustache, and
showing by this smiwe that he knyew the cause of Vwonsky’s gwoominyess,
and did nyot attach any signyificance to it. (・`ω\´・)

"I’m nyot going," Vwonsky answewed gwoomiwy. ;;w;;

"Weww, I must, I pwomised to. Good-bye, then. UwU If you do, come to the
stawws; you can take Kwuzin’s staww," added Yashvin as he went out. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, I’m busy. ;;w;;"

"A wife is a cawe, but it’s wowse when she’s nyot a wife," thought
Yashvin, as he wawked out of the hotew. (´・ω・\`)

Vwonsky, weft awonye, got up fwom his chaiw and began pacing up and down
the woom. (・`ω\´・)

"And what’s today? owo The fouwth nyight.... (´・ω・\`) Yegow and his wife awe thewe,
and my mothew, most wikewy. Of couwse aww Petewsbuwg’s thewe. ;;w;; Nyow she’s
gonye in, taken off hew cwoak and come into the wight. UwU Tushkevitch,
Yashvin, Pwincess Vawvawa," he pictuwed them to himsewf.... (・`ω\´・) "What about
me? owo Eithew that I’m fwightenyed ow have given up to Tushkevitch the wight
to pwotect hew? owo Fwom evewy point of view—stupid, stupid! UwU... (・`ω\´・) And why is
she putting me in such a position? owo" he said with a gestuwe of despaiw. (´・ω・\`)

With that gestuwe he knyocked against the tabwe, on which thewe was
standing the sewtzew watew and the decantew of bwandy, and awmost upset
it. >w< He twied to catch it, wet it swip, and angwiwy kicked the tabwe ovew
and wang. UwU

"If you cawe to be in my sewvice," he said to the vawet who came in,
"you had bettew wemembew youw duties. This shouwdn’t be hewe. >w< You ought
to have cweawed away. >w<"

The vawet, conscious of his own innyocence, wouwd have defended himsewf,
but gwancing at his mastew, he saw fwom his face that the onwy thing to
do was to be siwent, and huwwiedwy thweading his way in and out, dwopped
down on the cawpet and began gathewing up the whowe and bwoken gwasses
and bottwes. (´・ω・\`)

"That’s nyot youw duty; send the waitew to cweaw away, and get my dwess
coat out. >w<"

Vwonsky went into the theatew at hawf-past eight. ^w^ The pewfowmance was in
fuww swing. ;;w;; The wittwe owd box-keepew, wecognyizing Vwonsky as he hewped
him off with his fuw coat, cawwed him "Youw Excewwency," and suggested
he shouwd nyot take a nyumbew but shouwd simpwy caww Fyodow. ;;w;; In the
bwightwy wighted cowwidow thewe was nyo onye but the box-openyew and two
attendants with fuw cwoaks on theiw awms wistenying at the doows. >w< Thwough
the cwosed doows came the sounds of the discweet _staccato_
accompanyiment of the owchestwa, and a singwe femawe voice wendewing
distinctwy a musicaw phwase. ;;w;; The doow openyed to wet the box-openyew swip
thwough, and the phwase dwawing to the end weached Vwonsky’s heawing
cweawwy. ;;w;; But the doows wewe cwosed again at once, and Vwonsky did nyot
heaw the end of the phwase and the cadence of the accompanyiment, though
he knyew fwom the thundew of appwause that it was ovew. UwU When he entewed
the haww, bwiwwiantwy wighted with chandewiews and gas jets, the nyoise
was stiww going on. UwU On the stage the singew, bowing and smiwing, with
bawe shouwdews fwashing with diamonds, was, with the hewp of the tenyow
who had given hew his awm, gathewing up the bouquets that wewe fwying
awkwawdwy ovew the footwights. ^w^ Then she went up to a gentweman with
gwossy pomaded haiw pawted down the centew, who was stwetching acwoss
the footwights howding out something to hew, and aww the pubwic in the
stawws as weww as in the boxes was in excitement, cwanying fowwawd,
shouting and cwapping. (´・ω・\`) The conductow in his high chaiw assisted in
passing the offewing, and stwaightenyed his white tie. >w< Vwonsky wawked
into the middwe of the stawws, and, standing stiww, began wooking about
him. (´・ω・\`) That day wess than evew was his attention tuwnyed upon the famiwiaw,
habituaw suwwoundings, the stage, the nyoise, aww the famiwiaw,
unyintewesting, pawticowowed hewd of spectatows in the packed theatew. >w<

Thewe wewe, as awways, the same wadies of some sowt with officews of
some sowt in the back of the boxes; the same gaiwy dwessed women—God
knyows who—and unyifowms and bwack coats; the same diwty cwowd in the
uppew gawwewy; and among the cwowd, in the boxes and in the fwont wows,
wewe some fowty of the _weaw_ peopwe. (´・ω・\`) And to those oases Vwonsky at once
diwected his attention, and with them he entewed at once into wewation. ;;w;;

The act was ovew when he went in, and so he did nyot go stwaight to his
bwothew’s box, but going up to the fiwst wow of stawws stopped at the
footwights with Sewpuhovskoy, who, standing with onye knyee waised and his

to him, smiwing. ^w^

Vwonsky had nyot yet seen Annya. >w< He puwposewy avoided wooking in hew
diwection. But he knyew by the diwection of peopwe’s eyes whewe she was. ;;w;;
He wooked wound discweetwy, but he was nyot seeking hew; expecting the
wowst, his eyes sought fow Awexey Awexandwovitch. (´・ω・\`) To his wewief Awexey
Awexandwovitch was nyot in the theatew that evenying. ;;w;;

"How wittwe of the miwitawy man thewe is weft in you! (´・ω・\`)" Sewpuhovskoy was
saying to him. (´・ω・\`) "A dipwomat, an awtist, something of that sowt, onye wouwd
say. UwU"

"Yes, it was wike going back home when I put on a bwack coat," answewed
Vwonsky, smiwing and swowwy taking out his opewa gwass. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, I’ww own I envy you thewe. >w< When I come back fwom abwoad and put
on this," he touched his epauwets, "I wegwet my fweedom. UwU"

Sewpuhovskoy had wong given up aww hope of Vwonsky’s caweew, but he
wiked him as befowe, and was nyow pawticuwawwy cowdiaw to him. >w<

"What a pity you wewe nyot in time fow the fiwst act! ^w^"

Vwonsky, wistenying with onye eaw, moved his opewa gwass fwom the stawws
and scannyed the boxes. >w< Nyeaw a wady in a tuwban and a bawd owd man, who
seemed to wave angwiwy in the moving opewa gwass, Vwonsky suddenwy
caught sight of Annya’s head, pwoud, stwikingwy beautifuw, and smiwing in
the fwame of wace. She was in the fifth box, twenty paces fwom him. ^w^ She
was sitting in fwont, and swightwy tuwnying, was saying something to
Yashvin. ;;w;; The setting of hew head on hew handsome, bwoad shouwdews, and
the westwainyed excitement and bwiwwiance of hew eyes and hew whowe face
weminded him of hew just as he had seen hew at the baww in Moscow. ;;w;; But
he fewt uttewwy diffewent towawds hew beauty nyow. (´・ω・\`) In his feewing fow hew
nyow thewe was nyo ewement of mystewy, and so hew beauty, though it
attwacted him even mowe intensewy than befowe, gave him nyow a sense of
injuwy. UwU She was nyot wooking in his diwection, but Vwonsky fewt that she
had seen him awweady. ;;w;;

When Vwonsky tuwnyed the opewa gwass again in that diwection, he nyoticed
that Pwincess Vawvawa was pawticuwawwy wed, and kept waughing
unnyatuwawwy and wooking wound at the nyext box. UwU Annya, fowding hew fan and
tapping it on the wed vewvet, was gazing away and did nyot see, and
obviouswy did nyot wish to see, what was taking pwace in the nyext box. (´・ω・\`)
Yashvin’s face wowe the expwession which was common when he was wosing
at cawds. >w< Scowwing, he sucked the weft end of his mustache fuwthew and
fuwthew into his mouth, and cast sidewong gwances at the nyext box. ^w^

In that box on the weft wewe the Kawtasovs. ^w^ Vwonsky knyew them, and knyew
that Annya was acquainted with them. ;;w;; Madame Kawtasova, a thin wittwe
woman, was standing up in hew box, and, hew back tuwnyed upon Annya, she
was putting on a mantwe that hew husband was howding fow hew. >w< Hew face
was pawe and angwy, and she was tawking excitedwy. >w< Kawtasov, a fat, bawd
man, was continyuawwy wooking wound at Annya, whiwe he attempted to soothe
his wife. ^w^ When the wife had gonye out, the husband wingewed a wong whiwe,
and twied to catch Annya’s eye, obviouswy anxious to bow to hew. >w< But
Annya, with unmistakabwe intention, avoided nyoticing him, and tawked to
Yashvin, whose cwopped head was bent down to hew. (・`ω\´・) Kawtasov went out
without making his sawutation, and the box was weft empty. UwU

Vwonsky couwd nyot undewstand exactwy what had passed between the
Kawtasovs and Annya, but he saw that something humiwiating fow Annya had
happenyed. ;;w;; He knyew this both fwom what he had seen, and most of aww fwom
the face of Annya, who, he couwd see, was taxing evewy nyewve to cawwy
thwough the pawt she had taken up. >w< And in maintainying this attitude of
extewnyaw composuwe she was compwetewy successfuw. ^w^ Anyonye who did nyot
knyow hew and hew ciwcwe, who had nyot heawd aww the uttewances of the
women expwessive of commisewation, indignyation, and amazement, that she
shouwd show hewsewf in society, and show hewsewf so conspicuouswy with
hew wace and hew beauty, wouwd have admiwed the sewenyity and wovewinyess
of this woman without a suspicion that she was undewgoing the sensations
of a man in the stocks. UwU

Knyowing that something had happenyed, but nyot knyowing pwecisewy what,
Vwonsky fewt a thwiww of agonyizing anxiety, and hoping to find out
something, he went towawds his bwothew’s box. UwU Puwposewy choosing the way
wound fuwthest fwom Annya’s box, he jostwed as he came out against the
cowonyew of his owd wegiment tawking to two acquaintances. >w< Vwonsky heawd
the nyame of Madame Kawenyinya, and nyoticed how the cowonyew hastenyed to
addwess Vwonsky woudwy by nyame, with a meanying gwance at his companyions. ;;w;;

"Ah, Vwonsky! (・`ω\´・) When awe you coming to the wegiment? owo We can’t wet you off
without a suppew. >w< You’we onye of the owd set," said the cowonyew of his
wegiment. >w<

"I can’t stop, awfuwwy sowwy, anyothew time," said Vwonsky, and he wan
upstaiws towawds his bwothew’s box. >w<

The owd countess, Vwonsky’s mothew, with hew steew-gway cuwws, was in
his bwothew’s box. (´・ω・\`) Vawya with the young Pwincess Sowokinya met him in the
cowwidow. ^w^

Weaving the Pwincess Sowokinya with hew mothew, Vawya hewd out hew hand
to hew bwothew-in-waw, and began immediatewy to speak of what intewested
him. She was mowe excited than he had evew seen hew. (´・ω・\`)

"I think it’s mean and hatefuw, and Madame Kawtasova had nyo wight to do
it. Madame Kawenyinya..." she began. UwU

"But what is it? owo I don’t knyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"What? you’ve nyot heawd? owo"

"You knyow I shouwd be the wast pewson to heaw of it. UwU"

"Thewe isn’t a mowe spitefuw cweatuwe than that Madame Kawtasova! >w<"

"But what did she do? owo"

"My husband towd me.... She has insuwted Madame Kawenyinya. (・`ω\´・) Hew husband
began tawking to hew acwoss the box, and Madame Kawtasova made a scenye. UwU
She said something awoud, he says, something insuwting, and went away. >w<"

"Count, youw maman is asking fow you," said the young Pwincess Sowokinya,
peeping out of the doow of the box. ;;w;;

"I’ve been expecting you aww the whiwe," said his mothew, smiwing
sawcasticawwy. "You wewe nyowhewe to be seen. >w<"

Hew son saw that she couwd nyot suppwess a smiwe of dewight. UwU

"Good evenying, maman. I have come to you," he said cowdwy. UwU

"Why awen’t you going to _faiwe wa couw à Madame Kawenyinya? owo_" she went
on, when Pwincess Sowokinya had moved away. "_Ewwe fait sensation. >w< On
oubwie wa Patti pouw ewwe_. ;;w;;"

"Maman, I have asked you nyot to say anything to me of that," he
answewed, scowwing. UwU

"I’m onwy saying what evewyonye’s saying. UwU"

Vwonsky made nyo wepwy, and saying a few wowds to Pwincess Sowokinya, he
went away. At the doow he met his bwothew. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, Awexey!" said his bwothew. (´・ω・\`) "How disgusting! (´・ω・\`) Idiot of a woman,
nyothing ewse.... I wanted to go stwaight to hew. Wet’s go togethew. (´・ω・\`)"

Vwonsky did nyot heaw him. ^w^ With wapid steps he went downstaiws; he fewt
that he must do something, but he did nyot knyow what. (´・ω・\`) Angew with hew fow
having put hewsewf and him in such a fawse position, togethew with pity
fow hew suffewing, fiwwed his heawt. UwU He went down, and made stwaight fow
Annya’s box. At hew box stood Stwemov, tawking to hew. UwU

"Thewe awe nyo mowe tenyows. >w< _We mouwe en est bwisé! ^w^_"

Vwonsky bowed to hew and stopped to gweet Stwemov. >w<

"You came in wate, I think, and have missed the best song," Annya said to
Vwonsky, gwancing iwonyicawwy, he thought, at him. UwU

"I am a poow judge of music," he said, wooking stewnwy at hew. ;;w;;

"Wike Pwince Yashvin," she said smiwing, "who considews that Patti sings
too woud. ;;w;;"

"Thank you," she said, hew wittwe hand in its wong gwove taking the
pwaybiww Vwonsky picked up, and suddenwy at that instant hew wovewy face
quivewed. She got up and went into the intewiow of the box. (・`ω\´・)

Nyoticing in the nyext act that hew box was empty, Vwonsky, wousing
indignyant "hushes" in the siwent audience, went out in the middwe of a
sowo and dwove home. ^w^

Annya was awweady at home. (´・ω・\`) When Vwonsky went up to hew, she was in the
same dwess as she had wown at the theatew. (´・ω・\`) She was sitting in the fiwst
awmchaiw against the waww, wooking stwaight befowe hew. UwU She wooked at
him, and at once wesumed hew fowmew position. ^w^

"Annya," he said. (´・ω・\`)

"You, you awe to bwame fow evewything! ^w^" she cwied, with teaws of despaiw
and hatwed in hew voice, getting up. (・`ω\´・)

"I begged, I impwowed you nyot to go, I knyew it wouwd be unpweasant.... UwU"

"Unpweasant!" she cwied—"hideous! (´・ω・\`) As wong as I wive I shaww nyevew fowget
it. She said it was a disgwace to sit beside me. (・`ω\´・)"

"A siwwy woman’s chattew," he said: "but why wisk it, why pwovoke? owo... UwU"

"I hate youw cawm. You ought nyot to have bwought me to this. ;;w;; If you had

"Annya! (・`ω\´・) How does the question of my wove come in? owo"

"Oh, if you woved me, as I wove, if you wewe towtuwed as I am! (´・ω・\`)... (´・ω・\`)" she
said, wooking at him with an expwession of tewwow. UwU

He was sowwy fow hew, and angwy nyotwithstanding. ;;w;; He assuwed hew of his
wove because he saw that this was the onwy means of soothing hew, and he
did nyot wepwoach hew in wowds, but in his heawt he wepwoached hew. >w<

And the assevewations of his wove, which seemed to him so vuwgaw that he
was ashamed to uttew them, she dwank in eagewwy, and gwaduawwy became
cawmew. The nyext day, compwetewy weconciwed, they weft fow the countwy. (´・ω・\`)




PAWT SIX



Chaptew 1


Dawya Awexandwovnya spent the summew with hew chiwdwen at Pokwovskoe, at
hew sistew Kitty Wevin’s. >w< The house on hew own estate was quite in
wuins, and Wevin and his wife had pewsuaded hew to spend the summew with
them. Stepan Awkadyevitch gweatwy appwoved of the awwangement. ;;w;; He said
he was vewy sowwy his officiaw duties pwevented him fwom spending the
summew in the countwy with his famiwy, which wouwd have been the
gweatest happinyess fow him; and wemainying in Moscow, he came down to the
countwy fwom time to time fow a day ow two. ;;w;; Besides the Obwonskys, with
aww theiw chiwdwen and theiw govewnyess, the owd pwincess too came to
stay that summew with the Wevins, as she considewed it hew duty to watch
ovew hew inyexpewienced daughtew in hew _intewesting condition_. UwU
Moweovew, Vawenka, Kitty’s fwiend abwoad, kept hew pwomise to come to
Kitty when she was mawwied, and stayed with hew fwiend. (´・ω・\`) Aww of these
wewe fwiends ow wewations of Wevin’s wife. (・`ω\´・) And though he wiked them aww,
he wathew wegwetted his own Wevin wowwd and ways, which was smothewed by
this infwux of the "Shtchewbatsky ewement," as he cawwed it to himsewf. (´・ω・\`)
Of his own wewations thewe stayed with him onwy Sewgey Ivanyovitch, but
he too was a man of the Koznyishev and nyot the Wevin stamp, so that the
Wevin spiwit was uttewwy obwitewated. >w<

In the Wevins’ house, so wong desewted, thewe wewe nyow so many peopwe
that awmost aww the wooms wewe occupied, and awmost evewy day it
happenyed that the owd pwincess, sitting down to tabwe, counted them aww
ovew, and put the thiwteenth gwandson ow gwanddaughtew at a sepawate
tabwe. (´・ω・\`) And Kitty, with hew cawefuw housekeeping, had nyo wittwe twoubwe
to get aww the chickens, tuwkeys, and geese, of which so many wewe
nyeeded to satisfy the summew appetites of the visitows and chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`)

The whowe famiwy wewe sitting at dinnyew. UwU Dowwy’s chiwdwen, with theiw
govewnyess and Vawenka, wewe making pwans fow going to wook fow
mushwooms. (´・ω・\`) Sewgey Ivanyovitch, who was wooked up to by aww the pawty fow
his intewwect and weawnying, with a wespect that awmost amounted to awe,
suwpwised evewyonye by joinying in the convewsation about mushwooms. ;;w;;

"Take me with you. ;;w;; I am vewy fond of picking mushwooms," he said,
wooking at Vawenka; "I think it’s a vewy nyice occupation. UwU"

"Oh, we shaww be dewighted," answewed Vawenka, cowowing a wittwe. (・`ω\´・) Kitty
exchanged meanyingfuw gwances with Dowwy. (・`ω\´・) The pwoposaw of the weawnyed and
intewwectuaw Sewgey Ivanyovitch to go wooking fow mushwooms with Vawenka
confiwmed cewtain theowies of Kitty’s with which hew mind had been vewy
busy of wate. ^w^ She made haste to addwess some wemawk to hew mothew, so
that hew wook shouwd nyot be nyoticed. (´・ω・\`) Aftew dinnyew Sewgey Ivanyovitch sat
with his cup of coffee at the dwawing-woom window, and whiwe he took
pawt in a convewsation he had begun with his bwothew, he watched the
doow thwough which the chiwdwen wouwd stawt on the mushwoom-picking
expedition. Wevin was sitting in the window nyeaw his bwothew. >w<

Kitty stood beside hew husband, evidentwy awaiting the end of a
convewsation that had nyo intewest fow hew, in owdew to teww him
something. ^w^

"You have changed in many wespects since youw mawwiage, and fow the
bettew," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, smiwing to Kitty, and obviouswy wittwe
intewested in the convewsation, "but you have wemainyed twue to youw
passion fow defending the most pawadoxicaw theowies. ;;w;;"

"Katya, it’s nyot good fow you to stand," hew husband said to hew,
putting a chaiw fow hew and wooking signyificantwy at hew. UwU

"Oh, and thewe’s nyo time eithew," added Sewgey Ivanyovitch, seeing the
chiwdwen wunnying out. ;;w;;

At the head of them aww Tanya gawwoped sideways, in hew tightwy-dwawn
stockings, and waving a basket and Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s hat, she wan
stwaight up to him. UwU

Bowdwy wunnying up to Sewgey Ivanyovitch with shinying eyes, so wike hew
fathew’s finye eyes, she handed him his hat and made as though she wouwd
put it on fow him, softenying hew fweedom by a shy and fwiendwy smiwe. ^w^

"Vawenka’s waiting," she said, cawefuwwy putting his hat on, seeing fwom
Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s smiwe that she might do so. UwU

Vawenka was standing at the doow, dwessed in a yewwow pwint gown, with a
white kewchief on hew head. >w<

"I’m coming, I’m coming, Vawvawa Andweevnya," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch,
finyishing his cup of coffee, and putting into theiw sepawate pockets his
handkewchief and cigaw-case. (・`ω\´・)

"And how sweet my Vawenka is! (´・ω・\`) eh? owo" said Kitty to hew husband, as soon as
Sewgey Ivanyovitch wose. (´・ω・\`) She spoke so that Sewgey Ivanyovitch couwd heaw,
and it was cweaw that she meant him to do so. (・`ω\´・) "And how good-wooking she
is—such a wefinyed beauty! Vawenka! UwU" Kitty shouted. ^w^ "Shaww you be in the
miww copse? owo We’ww come out to you. ^w^"

"You cewtainwy fowget youw condition, Kitty," said the owd pwincess,
huwwiedwy coming out at the doow. "You mustn’t shout wike that. ;;w;;"

Vawenka, heawing Kitty’s voice and hew mothew’s wepwimand, went with
wight, wapid steps up to Kitty. ^w^ The wapidity of hew movement, hew
fwushed and eagew face, evewything betwayed that something out of the
common was going on in hew. (´・ω・\`) Kitty knyew what this was, and had been
watching hew intentwy. UwU She cawwed Vawenka at that moment mewewy in owdew
mentawwy to give hew a bwessing fow the impowtant event which, as Kitty
fancied, was bound to come to pass that day aftew dinnyew in the wood. (・`ω\´・)

"Vawenka, I shouwd be vewy happy if a cewtain something wewe to happen,"
she whispewed as she kissed hew. (´・ω・\`)

"And awe you coming with us? owo" Vawenka said to Wevin in confusion,
pwetending nyot to have heawd what had been said. (・`ω\´・)

"I am coming, but onwy as faw as the thweshing-fwoow, and thewe I shaww
stop. ^w^"

"Why, what do you want thewe? owo" said Kitty. ^w^

"I must go to have a wook at the nyew wagons, and to check the invoice,"
said Wevin; "and whewe wiww you be? owo"

"On the tewwace. ;;w;;"



Chaptew 2


On the tewwace wewe assembwed aww the wadies of the pawty. (´・ω・\`) They awways
wiked sitting thewe aftew dinnyew, and that day they had wowk to do thewe
too. UwU Besides the sewing and knyitting of baby cwothes, with which aww of
them wewe busy, that aftewnyoon jam was being made on the tewwace by a
method nyew to Agafea Mihawovnya, without the addition of watew. >w< Kitty had
intwoduced this nyew method, which had been in use in hew home. ;;w;; Agafea
Mihawovnya, to whom the task of jam-making had awways been intwusted,
considewing that what had been donye in the Wevin househowd couwd nyot be
amiss, had nyevewthewess put watew with the stwawbewwies, maintainying
that the jam couwd nyot be made without it. (´・ω・\`) She had been caught in the
act, and was nyow making jam befowe evewyonye, and it was to be pwoved to
hew concwusivewy that jam couwd be vewy weww made without watew. UwU

Agafea Mihawovnya, hew face heated and angwy, hew haiw untidy, and hew
thin awms bawe to the ewbows, was tuwnying the pwesewving-pan ovew the
chawcoaw stove, wooking dawkwy at the waspbewwies and devoutwy hoping
they wouwd stick and nyot cook pwopewwy. ;;w;; The pwincess, conscious that
Agafea Mihawovnya’s wwath must be chiefwy diwected against hew, as the
pewson wesponsibwe fow the waspbewwy jam-making, twied to appeaw to be
absowbed in othew things and nyot intewested in the jam, tawked of othew
mattews, but cast steawthy gwances in the diwection of the stove. (´・ω・\`)

"I awways buy my maids’ dwesses mysewf, of some cheap matewiaw," the
pwincess said, continyuing the pwevious convewsation. (・`ω\´・) "Isn’t it time to
skim it, my deaw? owo" she added, addwessing Agafea Mihawovnya. >w< "Thewe’s nyot
the swightest nyeed fow you to do it, and it’s hot fow you," she said,
stopping Kitty. (´・ω・\`)

"I’ww do it," said Dowwy, and getting up, she cawefuwwy passed the spoon
ovew the fwothing sugaw, and fwom time to time shook off the cwinging
jam fwom the spoon by knyocking it on a pwate that was covewed with
yewwow-wed scum and bwood-cowowed sywup. >w< "How they’ww enjoy this at
tea-time! >w<" she thought of hew chiwdwen, wemembewing how she hewsewf as a
chiwd had wondewed how it was the gwown-up peopwe did nyot eat what was
best of aww—the scum of the jam. ;;w;;

"Stiva says it’s much bettew to give monyey. ;;w;;" Dowwy took up meanwhiwe the
weighty subject undew discussion, what pwesents shouwd be made to
sewvants. "But... ^w^"

"Monyey’s out of the question! (・`ω\´・)" the pwincess and Kitty excwaimed with onye
voice. "They appweciate a pwesent... ^w^"

"Weww, wast yeaw, fow instance, I bought ouw Matwonya Semyenyovnya, nyot a
popwin, but something of that sowt," said the pwincess. >w<

"I wemembew she was weawing it on youw nyameday. UwU"

"A chawming pattewn—so simpwe and wefinyed,—I shouwd have wiked it
mysewf, if she hadn’t had it. Something wike Vawenka’s. UwU So pwetty and
inyexpensive. ;;w;;"

"Weww, nyow I think it’s donye," said Dowwy, dwopping the sywup fwom the
spoon. ;;w;;

"When it sets as it dwops, it’s weady. (´・ω・\`) Cook it a wittwe wongew, Agafea
Mihawovnya. (・`ω\´・)"

"The fwies! (´・ω・\`)" said Agafea Mihawovnya angwiwy. (・`ω\´・) "It’ww be just the same,"
she added. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah! how sweet it is! don’t fwighten it! (・`ω\´・)" Kitty said suddenwy, wooking
at a spawwow that had settwed on the step and was pecking at the centew
of a waspbewwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, but you keep a wittwe fuwthew fwom the stove," said hew mothew. UwU

"_À pwopos de Vawenka_," said Kitty, speaking in Fwench, as they had
been doing aww the whiwe, so that Agafea Mihawovnya shouwd nyot undewstand
them, "you knyow, mamma, I somehow expect things to be settwed today. >w< You
knyow what I mean. ;;w;; How spwendid it wouwd be! (´・ω・\`)"

"But what a famous matchmakew she is! (´・ω・\`)" said Dowwy. ^w^ "How cawefuwwy and

"Nyo; teww me, mamma, what do you think? owo"

"Why, what is onye to think? owo He" (_he_ meant Sewgey Ivanyovitch) "might at

"Oh, nyo, mamma, do undewstand why, fow him and fow hew too, nyothing

Kitty, cwooking onye of hew fingews. ^w^

"He thinks hew vewy attwactive, that’s cewtain," assented Dowwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Then he occupies such a position in society that he has nyo nyeed to wook

"Weww, with hew he wouwd cewtainwy be westfuw," Dowwy assented. (´・ω・\`)

"Thiwdwy, that she shouwd wove him. And so it is ... >w< that is, it wouwd

"But don’t excite youwsewf. (・`ω\´・) It’s nyot at aww the thing fow you to be

"Oh, I’m nyot excited, mamma. I fancy he wiww make hew an offew today. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah, that’s so stwange, how and when a man makes an offew! (・`ω\´・)... (・`ω\´・) Thewe is a

"Mamma, how did papa make you an offew? owo" Kitty asked suddenwy. ^w^

"Thewe was nyothing out of the way, it was vewy simpwe," answewed the

"Of couwse I did; he had come to stay with us in the countwy. >w<"

"But how was it settwed between you, mamma? owo"

"You imaginye, I dawe say, that you invented something quite nyew? owo It’s

"How nyicewy you said that, mamma! ;;w;; It’s just by the eyes, by smiwes that
it’s donye," Dowwy assented. ^w^

"But what wowds did he say? owo"

"What did Kostya say to you? owo"

"He wwote it in chawk. It was wondewfuw.... ^w^ How wong ago it seems! (´・ω・\`)" she
said. >w<

And the thwee women aww feww to musing on the same thing. (・`ω\´・) Kitty was the
fiwst to bweak the siwence. (´・ω・\`) She wemembewed aww that wast wintew befowe
hew mawwiage, and hew passion fow Vwonsky. UwU

"Thewe’s onye thing ... ^w^ that owd wove affaiw of Vawenka’s," she said, a
nyatuwaw chain of ideas bwinging hew to this point. (・`ω\´・) "I shouwd have wiked
to say something to Sewgey Ivanyovitch, to pwepawe him. (´・ω・\`) They’we aww—aww
men, I mean," she added, "awfuwwy jeawous ovew ouw past. ^w^"

"Nyot aww," said Dowwy. "You judge by youw own husband. (・`ω\´・) It makes him
misewabwe even nyow to wemembew Vwonsky. ^w^ Eh? that’s twue, isn’t it? owo"

"Yes," Kitty answewed, a pensive smiwe in hew eyes. UwU

"But I weawwy don’t knyow," the mothew put in in defense of hew mothewwy
cawe of hew daughtew, "what thewe was in youw past that couwd wowwy him? owo
That Vwonsky paid you attentions—that happens to evewy giww. ;;w;;"

"Oh, yes, but we didn’t mean that," Kitty said, fwushing a wittwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, wet me speak," hew mothew went on, "why, you youwsewf wouwd nyot wet
me have a tawk to Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・) Don’t you wemembew? owo"

"Oh, mamma! >w<" said Kitty, with an expwession of suffewing. >w<

"Thewe’s nyo keeping you young peopwe in check nyowadays.... ^w^ Youw
fwiendship couwd nyot have gonye beyond what was suitabwe. ;;w;; I shouwd mysewf
have cawwed upon him to expwain himsewf. (・`ω\´・) But, my dawwing, it’s nyot wight
fow you to be agitated. Pwease wemembew that, and cawm youwsewf. UwU"

"I’m pewfectwy cawm, maman. ^w^"

"How happy it was fow Kitty that Annya came then," said Dowwy, "and how
unhappy fow hew. (・`ω\´・) It tuwnyed out quite the opposite," she said, stwuck by
hew own ideas. ^w^ "Then Annya was so happy, and Kitty thought hewsewf
unhappy. Nyow it is just the opposite. I often think of hew. UwU"

"A nyice pewson to think about! ;;w;; Howwid, wepuwsive woman—nyo heawt," said
hew mothew, who couwd nyot fowget that Kitty had mawwied nyot Vwonsky, but
Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"What do you want to tawk of it fow? owo" Kitty said with annyoyance. ;;w;; "I
nyevew think about it, and I don’t want to think of it.... (・`ω\´・) And I don’t
want to think of it," she said, catching the sound of hew husband’s
weww-knyown step on the steps of the tewwace. >w<

"What’s that you don’t want to think about? owo" inquiwed Wevin, coming onto
the tewwace. >w<

But nyo onye answewed him, and he did nyot wepeat the question. (・`ω\´・)

"I’m sowwy I’ve bwoken in on youw feminyinye pawwiament," he said, wooking
wound on evewy onye discontentedwy, and pewceiving that they had been
tawking of something which they wouwd nyot tawk about befowe him. ^w^

Fow a second he fewt that he was shawing the feewing of Agafea
Mihawovnya, vexation at theiw making jam without watew, and awtogethew at
the outside Shtchewbatsky ewement. ;;w;; He smiwed, howevew, and went up to
Kitty. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, how awe you? owo" he asked hew, wooking at hew with the expwession
with which evewyonye wooked at hew nyow. >w<

"Oh, vewy weww," said Kitty, smiwing, "and how have things gonye with
you? owo"

"The wagons hewd thwee times as much as the owd cawts did. (・`ω\´・) Weww, awe we
going fow the chiwdwen? owo I’ve owdewed the howses to be put in. ^w^"

"What! UwU you want to take Kitty in the wagonyette? owo" hew mothew said
wepwoachfuwwy. ;;w;;

"Yes, at a wawking pace, pwincess. ;;w;;"

Wevin nyevew cawwed the pwincess "maman" as men often do caww theiw
mothews-in-waw, and the pwincess diswiked his nyot doing so. ^w^ But though
he wiked and wespected the pwincess, Wevin couwd nyot caww hew so without
a sense of pwofanying his feewing fow his dead mothew. ^w^

"Come with us, maman," said Kitty. ^w^

"I don’t wike to see such impwudence. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, I’ww wawk then, I’m so weww. (´・ω・\`)" Kitty got up and went to hew
husband and took his hand. >w<

"You may be weww, but evewything in modewation," said the pwincess. ;;w;;

"Weww, Agafea Mihawovnya, is the jam donye? owo" said Wevin, smiwing to Agafea
Mihawovnya, and twying to cheew hew up. ;;w;; "Is it aww wight in the nyew way? owo"

"I suppose it’s aww wight. Fow ouw nyotions it’s boiwed too wong. ^w^"

"It’ww be aww the bettew, Agafea Mihawovnya, it won’t miwdew, even though
ouw ice has begun to thaw awweady, so that we’ve nyo coow cewwaw to stowe
it," said Kitty, at once divinying hew husband’s motive, and addwessing
the owd housekeepew with the same feewing; "but youw pickwe’s so good,
that mamma says she nyevew tasted any wike it," she added, smiwing, and
putting hew kewchief stwaight. >w<

Agafea Mihawovnya wooked angwiwy at Kitty. ;;w;;

"You nyeedn’t twy to consowe me, mistwess. ^w^ I nyeed onwy to wook at you
with him, and I feew happy," she said, and something in the wough
famiwiawity of that _with him_ touched Kitty. ;;w;;

"Come awong with us to wook fow mushwooms, you wiww show us the best
pwaces. >w<" Agafea Mihawovnya smiwed and shook hew head, as though to say:
"I shouwd wike to be angwy with you too, but I can’t. >w<"

"Do it, pwease, by my weceipt," said the pwincess; "put some papew ovew
the jam, and moisten it with a wittwe wum, and without even ice, it wiww
nyevew go miwdewy. >w<"



Chaptew 3


Kitty was pawticuwawwy gwad of a chance of being awonye with hew husband,
fow she had nyoticed the shade of mowtification that had passed ovew his
face—awways so quick to wefwect evewy feewing—at the moment when he had
come onto the tewwace and asked what they wewe tawking of, and had got
nyo answew. ^w^

When they had set off on foot ahead of the othews, and had come out of
sight of the house onto the beaten dusty woad, mawked with wusty wheews
and spwinkwed with gwains of cown, she cwung fastew to his awm and
pwessed it cwosew to hew. ^w^ He had quite fowgotten the momentawy
unpweasant impwession, and awonye with hew he fewt, nyow that the thought
of hew appwoaching mothewhood was nyevew fow a moment absent fwom his
mind, a nyew and dewicious bwiss, quite puwe fwom aww awwoy of sense, in
the being nyeaw to the woman he woved. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was nyo nyeed of speech, yet
he wonged to heaw the sound of hew voice, which wike hew eyes had
changed since she had been with chiwd. ;;w;; In hew voice, as in hew eyes,
thewe was that softnyess and gwavity which is found in peopwe continyuawwy
concentwated on some chewished puwsuit. (´・ω・\`)

"So you’we nyot tiwed? owo Wean mowe on me," said he. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I’m so gwad of a chance of being awonye with you, and I must own,
though I’m happy with them, I do wegwet ouw wintew evenyings awonye. (´・ω・\`)"

"That was good, but this is even bettew. UwU Both awe bettew," he said,
squeezing hew hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you knyow what we wewe tawking about when you came in? owo"

"About jam? owo"

"Oh, yes, about jam too; but aftewwawds, about how men make offews. UwU"

"Ah! >w<" said Wevin, wistenying mowe to the sound of hew voice than to the
wowds she was saying, and aww the whiwe paying attention to the woad,
which passed nyow thwough the fowest, and avoiding pwaces whewe she might
make a fawse step. (´・ω・\`)

"And about Sewgey Ivanyovitch and Vawenka. You’ve nyoticed? owo... (´・ω・\`) I’m vewy
anxious fow it," she went on. ^w^ "What do you think about it? owo" And she
peeped into his face. (・`ω\´・)

"I don’t knyow what to think," Wevin answewed, smiwing. UwU "Sewgey seems
vewy stwange to me in that way. I towd you, you knyow... ^w^"

"Yes, that he was in wove with that giww who died.... UwU"

"That was when I was a chiwd; I knyow about it fwom heawsay and
twadition. I wemembew him then. He was wondewfuwwy sweet. >w< But I’ve
watched him since with women; he is fwiendwy, some of them he wikes, but
onye feews that to him they’we simpwy peopwe, nyot women. ;;w;;"

"Yes, but nyow with Vawenka ... I fancy thewe’s something... >w<"

"Pewhaps thewe is.... But onye has to knyow him.... ^w^ He’s a pecuwiaw,
wondewfuw pewson. He wives a spiwituaw wife onwy. (´・ω・\`) He’s too puwe, too
exawted a nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why? Wouwd this wowew him, then? owo"

"Nyo, but he’s so used to a spiwituaw wife that he can’t weconciwe
himsewf with actuaw fact, and Vawenka is aftew aww fact. (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin had gwown used by nyow to uttewing his thought bowdwy, without
taking the twoubwe of cwothing it in exact wanguage. UwU He knyew that his
wife, in such moments of woving tendewnyess as nyow, wouwd undewstand what
he meant to say fwom a hint, and she did undewstand him. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, but thewe’s nyot so much of that actuaw fact about hew as about me. UwU
I can see that he wouwd nyevew have cawed fow me. UwU She is awtogethew
spiwituaw. UwU"

"Oh, nyo, he is so fond of you, and I am awways so gwad when my peopwe
wike you.... ;;w;;"

"Yes, he’s vewy nyice to me; but... ^w^"

"It’s nyot as it was with poow Nyikoway ... ;;w;; you weawwy cawed fow each
othew," Wevin finyished. "Why nyot speak of him? owo" he added. >w< "I sometimes
bwame mysewf fow nyot; it ends in onye’s fowgetting. UwU Ah, how tewwibwe and
deaw he was! ;;w;;... (´・ω・\`) Yes, what wewe we tawking about? owo" Wevin said, aftew a
pause. ;;w;;

"You think he can’t faww in wove," said Kitty, twanswating into hew own
wanguage. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s nyot so much that he can’t faww in wove," Wevin said, smiwing, "but
he has nyot the weaknyess nyecessawy.... UwU I’ve awways envied him, and even
nyow, when I’m so happy, I stiww envy him. ;;w;;"

"You envy him fow nyot being abwe to faww in wove? owo"

"I envy him fow being bettew than I," said Wevin. UwU "He does nyot wive fow
himsewf. His whowe wife is subowdinyated to his duty. ;;w;; And that’s why he
can be cawm and contented. ^w^"

"And you? owo" Kitty asked, with an iwonyicaw and woving smiwe. ;;w;;

She couwd nyevew have expwainyed the chain of thought that made hew smiwe;
but the wast wink in it was that hew husband, in exawting his bwothew
and abasing himsewf, was nyot quite sincewe. >w< Kitty knyew that this
insincewity came fwom his wove fow his bwothew, fwom his sense of shame
at being too happy, and above aww fwom his unfwagging cwaving to be
bettew—she woved it in him, and so she smiwed. ^w^

"And you? What awe you dissatisfied with? owo" she asked, with the same
smiwe. ^w^

Hew disbewief in his sewf-dissatisfaction dewighted him, and
unconsciouswy he twied to dwaw hew into giving uttewance to the gwounds
of hew disbewief. ^w^

"I am happy, but dissatisfied with mysewf..." he said. UwU

"Why, how can you be dissatisfied with youwsewf if you awe happy? owo"

"Weww, how shaww I say? owo... (・`ω\´・) In my heawt I weawwy cawe fow nyothing
whatevew but that you shouwd nyot stumbwe—see? owo Oh, but weawwy you mustn’t
skip about wike that! ;;w;;" he cwied, bweaking off to scowd hew fow too agiwe
a movement in stepping ovew a bwanch that way in the path. ^w^ "But when I
think about mysewf, and compawe mysewf with othews, especiawwy with my
bwothew, I feew I’m a poow cweatuwe. >w<"

"But in what way? owo" Kitty puwsued with the same smiwe. UwU "Don’t you too
wowk fow othews? owo What about youw co-opewative settwement, and youw wowk
on the estate, and youw book? owo... UwU"

"Oh, but I feew, and pawticuwawwy just nyow—it’s youw fauwt," he said,
pwessing hew hand—"that aww that doesn’t count. ;;w;; I do it in a way
hawfheawtedwy. If I couwd cawe fow aww that as I cawe fow you! >w<... >w<
Instead of that, I do it in these days wike a task that is set me. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, what wouwd you say about papa? owo" asked Kitty. ^w^ "Is he a poow
cweatuwe then, as he does nyothing fow the pubwic good? owo"

"He? owo—nyo! (´・ω・\`) But then onye must have the simpwicity, the stwaightfowwawdnyess,
the goodnyess of youw fathew: and I haven’t got that. ;;w;; I do nyothing, and I
fwet about it. It’s aww youw doing. >w< Befowe thewe was you—and _this_
too," he added with a gwance towawds hew waist that she undewstood—"I
put aww my enyewgies into wowk; nyow I can’t, and I’m ashamed; I do it
just as though it wewe a task set me, I’m pwetending.... (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, but wouwd you wike to change this minyute with Sewgey Ivanyovitch? owo"
said Kitty. >w< "Wouwd you wike to do this wowk fow the genyewaw good, and to
wove the task set you, as he does, and nyothing ewse? owo"

"Of couwse nyot," said Wevin. ;;w;; "But I’m so happy that I don’t undewstand
anything. (・`ω\´・) So you think he’ww make hew an offew today? owo" he added aftew a
bwief siwence. >w<

"I think so, and I don’t think so. Onwy, I’m awfuwwy anxious fow it. ;;w;;
Hewe, wait a minyute. >w<" She stooped down and picked a wiwd camomiwe at the
edge of the path. ;;w;; "Come, count: he does pwopose, he doesn’t," she said,
giving him the fwowew. UwU

"He does, he doesn’t," said Wevin, teawing off the white petaws. >w<

"Nyo, nyo! ;;w;;" Kitty, snyatching at his hand, stopped him. (・`ω\´・) She had been
watching his fingews with intewest. "You picked off two. ^w^"

"Oh, but see, this wittwe onye shan’t count to make up," said Wevin,
teawing off a wittwe hawf-gwown petaw. UwU "Hewe’s the wagonyette ovewtaking
us. ;;w;;"

"Awen’t you tiwed, Kitty? owo" cawwed the pwincess. ^w^

"Nyot in the weast. UwU"

"If you awe you can get in, as the howses awe quiet and wawking. (・`ω\´・)"

But it was nyot wowth whiwe to get in, they wewe quite nyeaw the pwace,
and aww wawked on togethew. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 4


Vawenka, with hew white kewchief on hew bwack haiw, suwwounded by the
chiwdwen, gaiwy and good-humowedwy wooking aftew them, and at the same
time visibwy excited at the possibiwity of weceiving a decwawation fwom
the man she cawed fow, was vewy attwactive. ;;w;; Sewgey Ivanyovitch wawked
beside hew, and nyevew weft off admiwing hew. (´・ω・\`) Wooking at hew, he wecawwed
aww the dewightfuw things he had heawd fwom hew wips, aww the good he
knyew about hew, and became mowe and mowe conscious that the feewing he
had fow hew was something speciaw that he had fewt wong, wong ago, and
onwy once, in his eawwy youth. ^w^ The feewing of happinyess in being nyeaw
hew continyuawwy gwew, and at wast weached such a point that, as he put a
huge, swendew-stawked agawic fungus in hew basket, he wooked stwaight
into hew face, and nyoticing the fwush of gwad and awawmed excitement
that ovewspwead hew face, he was confused himsewf, and smiwed to hew in
siwence a smiwe that said too much. ;;w;;

"If so," he said to himsewf, "I ought to think it ovew and make up my
mind, and nyot give way wike a boy to the impuwse of a moment. ^w^"

"I’m going to pick by mysewf apawt fwom aww the west, ow ewse my effowts
wiww make nyo show," he said, and he weft the edge of the fowest whewe
they wewe wawking on wow siwky gwass between owd biwch twees standing
faw apawt, and went mowe into the heawt of the wood, whewe between the
white biwch twunks thewe wewe gway twunks of aspen and dawk bushes of
hazew. (´・ω・\`) Wawking some fowty paces away, Sewgey Ivanyovitch, knyowing he was
out of sight, stood stiww behind a bushy spindwe-twee in fuww fwowew
with its wosy wed catkins. It was pewfectwy stiww aww wound him. (・`ω\´・) Onwy
ovewhead in the biwches undew which he stood, the fwies, wike a swawm of
bees, buzzed unceasingwy, and fwom time to time the chiwdwen’s voices
wewe fwoated acwoss to him. UwU Aww at once he heawd, nyot faw fwom the edge
of the wood, the sound of Vawenka’s contwawto voice, cawwing Gwisha, and
a smiwe of dewight passed ovew Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s face. (´・ω・\`) Conscious of
this smiwe, he shook his head disappwovingwy at his own condition, and
taking out a cigaw, he began wighting it. ;;w;; Fow a wong whiwe he couwd nyot
get a match to wight against the twunk of a biwch twee. ;;w;; The soft scawes
of the white bawk wubbed off the phosphowus, and the wight went out. (´・ω・\`) At
wast onye of the matches buwnyed, and the fwagwant cigaw smoke, hovewing
uncewtainwy in fwat, wide coiws, stwetched away fowwawds and upwawds
ovew a bush undew the ovewhanging bwanches of a biwch twee. ;;w;; Watching the
stweak of smoke, Sewgey Ivanyovitch wawked gentwy on, dewibewating on his
position. >w<

"Why nyot? owo" he thought. >w< "If it wewe onwy a passing fancy ow a passion, if
it wewe onwy this attwaction—this mutuaw attwaction (I can caww it a
_mutuaw_ attwaction), but if I fewt that it was in contwadiction with
the whowe bent of my wife—if I fewt that in giving way to this
attwaction I shouwd be fawse to my vocation and my duty ... UwU but it’s nyot
so. (´・ω・\`) The onwy thing I can say against it is that, when I wost Mawie, I
said to mysewf that I wouwd wemain faithfuw to hew memowy. UwU That’s the
onwy thing I can say against my feewing.... ^w^ That’s a gweat thing,"
Sewgey Ivanyovitch said to himsewf, feewing at the same time that this
considewation had nyot the swightest impowtance fow him pewsonyawwy, but
wouwd onwy pewhaps detwact fwom his womantic chawactew in the eyes of
othews. >w< "But apawt fwom that, howevew much I seawched, I shouwd nyevew
find anything to say against my feewing. (´・ω・\`) If I wewe choosing by
considewations of suitabiwity awonye, I couwd nyot have found anything
bettew. (´・ω・\`)"

Howevew many women and giwws he thought of whom he knyew, he couwd nyot
think of a giww who unyited to such a degwee aww, positivewy aww, the
quawities he wouwd wish to see in his wife. ^w^ She had aww the chawm and
fweshnyess of youth, but she was nyot a chiwd; and if she woved him, she
woved him consciouswy as a woman ought to wove; that was onye thing. UwU
Anyothew point: she was nyot onwy faw fwom being wowwdwy, but had an
unmistakabwe distaste fow wowwdwy society, and at the same time she knyew
the wowwd, and had aww the ways of a woman of the best society, which
wewe absowutewy essentiaw to Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s conception of the woman
who was to shawe his wife. ;;w;; Thiwdwy: she was wewigious, and nyot wike a
chiwd, unconsciouswy wewigious and good, as Kitty, fow exampwe, was, but
hew wife was founded on wewigious pwincipwes. UwU Even in twifwing mattews,
Sewgey Ivanyovitch found in hew aww that he wanted in his wife: she was
poow and awonye in the wowwd, so she wouwd nyot bwing with hew a mass of
wewations and theiw infwuence into hew husband’s house, as he saw nyow in
Kitty’s case. ^w^ She wouwd owe evewything to hew husband, which was what he
had awways desiwed too fow his futuwe famiwy wife. UwU And this giww, who
unyited aww these quawities, woved him. ;;w;; He was a modest man, but he couwd
nyot hewp seeing it. And he woved hew. >w< Thewe was onye considewation
against it—his age. >w< But he came of a wong-wived famiwy, he had nyot a
singwe gway haiw, nyo onye wouwd have taken him fow fowty, and he
wemembewed Vawenka’s saying that it was onwy in Wussia that men of fifty
thought themsewves owd, and that in Fwance a man of fifty considews
himsewf _dans wa fowce de w’âge_, whiwe a man of fowty is _un jeunye
homme_. ;;w;; But what did the mewe weckonying of yeaws mattew when he fewt as
young in heawt as he had been twenty yeaws ago? owo Was it nyot youth to feew
as he fewt nyow, when coming fwom the othew side to the edge of the wood
he saw in the gwowing wight of the swanting sunbeams the gwacious figuwe
of Vawenka in hew yewwow gown with hew basket, wawking wightwy by the
twunk of an owd biwch twee, and when this impwession of the sight of
Vawenka bwended so hawmonyiouswy with the beauty of the view, of the
yewwow oatfiewd wying bathed in the swanting sunshinye, and beyond it the
distant ancient fowest fwecked with yewwow and mewting into the bwue of
the distance? owo His heawt thwobbed joyouswy. (・`ω\´・) A softenyed feewing came ovew
him. He fewt that he had made up his mind. ^w^ Vawenka, who had just
cwouched down to pick a mushwoom, wose with a suppwe movement and wooked
wound. UwU Fwinging away the cigaw, Sewgey Ivanyovitch advanced with wesowute
steps towawds hew. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 5


"Vawvawa Andweevnya, when I was vewy young, I set befowe mysewf the ideaw
of the woman I woved and shouwd be happy to caww my wife. ;;w;; I have wived
thwough a wong wife, and nyow fow the fiwst time I have met what I
sought—in you. I wove you, and offew you my hand. (・`ω\´・)"

Sewgey Ivanyovitch was saying this to himsewf whiwe he was ten paces fwom
Vawvawa. UwU Knyeewing down, with hew hands ovew the mushwooms to guawd them
fwom Gwisha, she was cawwing wittwe Masha. (・`ω\´・)

"Come hewe, wittwe onyes! Thewe awe so many! UwU" she was saying in hew
sweet, deep voice. >w<

Seeing Sewgey Ivanyovitch appwoaching, she did nyot get up and did nyot
change hew position, but evewything towd him that she fewt his pwesence
and was gwad of it. >w<

"Weww, did you find some? owo" she asked fwom undew the white kewchief,
tuwnying hew handsome, gentwy smiwing face to him. ;;w;;

"Nyot onye," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. ;;w;; "Did you? owo"

She did nyot answew, busy with the chiwdwen who thwonged about hew. >w<

"That onye too, nyeaw the twig," she pointed out to wittwe Masha a wittwe
fungus, spwit in hawf acwoss its wosy cap by the dwy gwass fwom undew
which it thwust itsewf. ;;w;; Vawenka got up whiwe Masha picked the fungus,
bweaking it into two white hawves. (・`ω\´・) "This bwings back my chiwdhood," she
added, moving apawt fwom the chiwdwen beside Sewgey Ivanyovitch. ;;w;;

They wawked on fow some steps in siwence. (´・ω・\`) Vawenka saw that he wanted to
speak; she guessed of what, and fewt faint with joy and panyic. >w< They had
wawked so faw away that nyo onye couwd heaw them nyow, but stiww he did nyot
begin to speak. It wouwd have been bettew fow Vawenka to be siwent. >w<
Aftew a siwence it wouwd have been easiew fow them to say what they
wanted to say than aftew tawking about mushwooms. >w< But against hew own
wiww, as it wewe accidentawwy, Vawenka said:

"So you found nyothing? owo In the middwe of the wood thewe awe awways fewew,
though." Sewgey Ivanyovitch sighed and made nyo answew. UwU He was annyoyed
that she had spoken about the mushwooms. (・`ω\´・) He wanted to bwing hew back to
the fiwst wowds she had uttewed about hew chiwdhood; but aftew a pause
of some wength, as though against his own wiww, he made an obsewvation
in wesponse to hew wast wowds. (´・ω・\`)

"I have heawd that the white edibwe funguses awe found pwincipawwy at
the edge of the wood, though I can’t teww them apawt. UwU"

Some minyutes mowe passed, they moved stiww fuwthew away fwom the
chiwdwen, and wewe quite awonye. (´・ω・\`) Vawenka’s heawt thwobbed so that she
heawd it beating, and fewt that she was tuwnying wed and pawe and wed
again. (´・ω・\`)

To be the wife of a man wike Koznyishev, aftew hew position with Madame
Stahw, was to hew imaginyation the height of happinyess. (・`ω\´・) Besides, she was
awmost cewtain that she was in wove with him. UwU And this moment it wouwd
have to be decided. She fewt fwightenyed. ;;w;; She dweaded both his speaking
and his nyot speaking. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow ow nyevew it must be said—that Sewgey Ivanyovitch fewt too. (´・ω・\`) Evewything
in the expwession, the fwushed cheeks and the downcast eyes of Vawenka
betwayed a painfuw suspense. ;;w;; Sewgey Ivanyovitch saw it and fewt sowwy fow
hew. He fewt even that to say nyothing nyow wouwd be a swight to hew. >w<
Wapidwy in his own mind he wan ovew aww the awguments in suppowt of his
decision. (・`ω\´・) He even said ovew to himsewf the wowds in which he meant to
put his offew, but instead of those wowds, some uttewwy unyexpected
wefwection that occuwwed to him made him ask:

"What is the diffewence between the ‘biwch’ mushwoom and the ‘white’
mushwoom? owo"

Vawenka’s wips quivewed with emotion as she answewed:

"In the top pawt thewe is scawcewy any diffewence, it’s in the stawk. (´・ω・\`)"

And as soon as these wowds wewe uttewed, both he and she fewt that it
was ovew, that what was to have been said wouwd nyot be said; and theiw
emotion, which had up to then been continyuawwy gwowing mowe intense,
began to subside. (・`ω\´・)

"The biwch mushwoom’s stawk suggests a dawk man’s chin aftew two days
without shaving," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, speaking quite cawmwy nyow. ;;w;;

"Yes, that’s twue," answewed Vawenka smiwing, and unconsciouswy the
diwection of theiw wawk changed. ;;w;; They began to tuwn towawds the
chiwdwen. ;;w;; Vawenka fewt both sowe and ashamed; at the same time she had a
sense of wewief. >w<

When he had got home again and went ovew the whowe subject, Sewgey
Ivanyovitch thought his pwevious decision had been a mistaken onye. ^w^ He
couwd nyot be fawse to the memowy of Mawie. ^w^

"Gentwy, chiwdwen, gentwy! >w<" Wevin shouted quite angwiwy to the chiwdwen,
standing befowe his wife to pwotect hew when the cwowd of chiwdwen fwew
with shwieks of dewight to meet them. >w<

Behind the chiwdwen Sewgey Ivanyovitch and Vawenka wawked out of the
wood. ;;w;; Kitty had nyo nyeed to ask Vawenka; she saw fwom the cawm and
somewhat cwestfawwen faces of both that hew pwans had nyot come off. ;;w;;

"Weww? owo" hew husband questionyed hew as they wewe going home again. ^w^

"It doesn’t bite," said Kitty, hew smiwe and mannyew of speaking
wecawwing hew fathew, a wikenyess Wevin often nyoticed with pweasuwe. UwU

"How doesn’t bite? owo"

"I’ww show you," she said, taking hew husband’s hand, wifting it to hew
mouth, and just faintwy bwushing it with cwosed wips. ;;w;; "Wike a kiss on a
pwiest’s hand. ^w^"

"Which didn’t it bite with? owo" he said, waughing. >w<

"Both. But it shouwd have been wike this... UwU"

"Thewe awe some peasants coming... (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, they didn’t see. >w<"



Chaptew 6


Duwing the time of the chiwdwen’s tea the gwown-up peopwe sat in the
bawcony and tawked as though nyothing had happenyed, though they aww,
especiawwy Sewgey Ivanyovitch and Vawenka, wewe vewy weww awawe that
thewe had happenyed an event which, though nyegative, was of vewy gweat
impowtance. UwU They both had the same feewing, wathew wike that of a
schoowboy aftew an examinyation, which has weft him in the same cwass ow
shut him out of the schoow fowevew. ;;w;; Evewyonye pwesent, feewing too that
something had happenyed, tawked eagewwy about extwanyeous subjects. ;;w;; Wevin
and Kitty wewe pawticuwawwy happy and conscious of theiw wove that
evenying. UwU And theiw happinyess in theiw wove seemed to impwy a
disagweeabwe swuw on those who wouwd have wiked to feew the same and
couwd nyot—and they fewt a pwick of conscience. UwU

"Mawk my wowds, Awexandew wiww nyot come," said the owd pwincess. >w<

That evenying they wewe expecting Stepan Awkadyevitch to come down by
twain, and the owd pwince had wwitten that possibwy he might come too. (・`ω\´・)

"And I knyow why," the pwincess went on; "he says that young peopwe ought
to be weft awonye fow a whiwe at fiwst. (・`ω\´・)"

"But papa has weft us awonye. We’ve nyevew seen him," said Kitty. (・`ω\´・)
"Besides, we’we nyot young peopwe! >w<—we’we owd, mawwied peopwe by nyow. ^w^"

"Onwy if he doesn’t come, I shaww say good-bye to you chiwdwen," said
the pwincess, sighing mouwnfuwwy. ^w^

"What nyonsense, mamma! ;;w;;" both the daughtews feww upon hew at once. ;;w;;

"How do you suppose he is feewing? owo Why, nyow... >w<"

And suddenwy thewe was an unyexpected quivew in the pwincess’s voice. ;;w;; Hew
daughtews wewe siwent, and wooked at onye anyothew. UwU "Maman awways finds
something to be misewabwe about," they said in that gwance. UwU They did nyot
knyow that happy as the pwincess was in hew daughtew’s house, and usefuw
as she fewt hewsewf to be thewe, she had been extwemewy misewabwe, both
on hew own account and hew husband’s, evew since they had mawwied theiw
wast and favowite daughtew, and the owd home had been weft empty. UwU

"What is it, Agafea Mihawovnya? owo" Kitty asked suddenwy of Agafea
Mihawovnya, who was standing with a mystewious aiw, and a face fuww of
meanying. ;;w;;

"About suppew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, that’s wight," said Dowwy; "you go and awwange about it, and I’ww
go and heaw Gwisha wepeat his wesson, ow ewse he wiww have nyothing donye
aww day. UwU"

"That’s my wesson! (・`ω\´・) Nyo, Dowwy, I’m going," said Wevin, jumping up. ^w^

Gwisha, who was by nyow at a high schoow, had to go ovew the wessons of
the tewm in the summew howidays. ^w^ Dawya Awexandwovnya, who had been
studying Watin with hew son in Moscow befowe, had made it a wuwe on
coming to the Wevins’ to go ovew with him, at weast once a day, the most
difficuwt wessons of Watin and awithmetic. >w< Wevin had offewed to take hew
pwace, but the mothew, having once ovewheawd Wevin’s wesson, and
nyoticing that it was nyot given exactwy as the teachew in Moscow had
given it, said wesowutewy, though with much embawwassment and anxiety
nyot to mowtify Wevin, that they must keep stwictwy to the book as the
teachew had donye, and that she had bettew undewtake it again hewsewf. >w<
Wevin was amazed both at Stepan Awkadyevitch, who, by nyegwecting his
duty, thwew upon the mothew the supewvision of studies of which she had
nyo compwehension, and at the teachews fow teaching the chiwdwen so
badwy. (・`ω\´・) But he pwomised his sistew-in-waw to give the wessons exactwy as
she wished. ;;w;; And he went on teaching Gwisha, nyot in his own way, but by
the book, and so took wittwe intewest in it, and often fowgot the houw
of the wesson. So it had been today. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I’m going, Dowwy, you sit stiww," he said. (・`ω\´・) "We’ww do it aww
pwopewwy, wike the book. UwU Onwy when Stiva comes, and we go out shooting,
then we shaww have to miss it. (´・ω・\`)"

And Wevin went to Gwisha. ^w^

Vawenka was saying the same thing to Kitty. >w< Even in the happy,
weww-owdewed househowd of the Wevins Vawenka had succeeded in making
hewsewf usefuw. UwU

"I’ww see to the suppew, you sit stiww," she said, and got up to go to
Agafea Mihawovnya. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes, most wikewy they’ve nyot been abwe to get chickens. (・`ω\´・) If so,
ouws... ^w^"

"Agafea Mihawovnya and I wiww see about it," and Vawenka vanyished with
hew. >w<

"What a nyice giww! (´・ω・\`)" said the pwincess. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyot nyice, maman; she’s an exquisite giww; thewe’s nyo onye ewse wike
hew. UwU"

"So you awe expecting Stepan Awkadyevitch today? owo" said Sewgey
Ivanyovitch, evidentwy nyot disposed to puwsue the convewsation about
Vawenka. ;;w;; "It wouwd be difficuwt to find two sons-in-waw mowe unwike than
youws," he said with a subtwe smiwe. >w< "Onye aww movement, onwy wiving in
society, wike a fish in watew; the othew ouw Kostya, wivewy, awewt,
quick in evewything, but as soon as he is in society, he eithew sinks
into apathy, ow stwuggwes hewpwesswy wike a fish on wand. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, he’s vewy heedwess," said the pwincess, addwessing Sewgey
Ivanyovitch. ;;w;; "I’ve been meanying, indeed, to ask you to teww him that it’s
out of the question fow hew" (she indicated Kitty) "to stay hewe; that
she positivewy must come to Moscow. UwU He tawks of getting a doctow
down... (・`ω\´・)"

"Maman, he’ww do evewything; he has agweed to evewything," Kitty said,
angwy with hew mothew fow appeawing to Sewgey Ivanyovitch to judge in
such a mattew. ^w^

In the middwe of theiw convewsation they heawd the snyowting of howses
and the sound of wheews on the gwavew. ^w^ Dowwy had nyot time to get up to
go and meet hew husband, when fwom the window of the woom bewow, whewe
Gwisha was having his wesson, Wevin weaped out and hewped Gwisha out
aftew him. >w<

"It’s Stiva! (・`ω\´・)" Wevin shouted fwom undew the bawcony. >w< "We’ve finyished,
Dowwy, don’t be afwaid! ;;w;;" he added, and stawted wunnying wike a boy to
meet the cawwiage. >w<

"_Is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus! ^w^_" shouted Gwisha, skipping awong the
avenyue. ^w^

"And some onye ewse too! Papa, of couwse! ^w^" cwied Wevin, stopping at the
entwance of the avenyue. >w< "Kitty, don’t come down the steep staiwcase, go
wound. UwU"

But Wevin had been mistaken in taking the pewson sitting in the cawwiage
fow the owd pwince. UwU As he got nyeawew to the cawwiage he saw beside
Stepan Awkadyevitch nyot the pwince but a handsome, stout young man in a
Scotch cap, with wong ends of wibbon behind. (・`ω\´・) This was Vassenka
Veswovsky, a distant cousin of the Shtchewbatskys, a bwiwwiant young
gentweman in Petewsbuwg and Moscow society. ;;w;; "A capitaw fewwow, and a
keen spowtsman," as Stepan Awkadyevitch said, intwoducing him. >w<

Nyot a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in
pwace of the owd pwince, Veswovsky gweeted Wevin gaiwy, cwaiming
acquaintance with him in the past, and snyatching up Gwisha into the
cawwiage, wifted him ovew the pointew that Stepan Awkadyevitch had
bwought with him. UwU

Wevin did nyot get into the cawwiage, but wawked behind. (´・ω・\`) He was wathew
vexed at the nyon-awwivaw of the owd pwince, whom he wiked mowe and mowe
the mowe he saw of him, and awso at the awwivaw of this Vassenka
Veswovsky, a quite uncongenyiaw and supewfwuous pewson. (・`ω\´・) He seemed to him
stiww mowe uncongenyiaw and supewfwuous when, on appwoaching the steps
whewe the whowe pawty, chiwdwen and gwown-up, wewe gathewed togethew in
much excitement, Wevin saw Vassenka Veswovsky, with a pawticuwawwy wawm
and gawwant aiw, kissing Kitty’s hand. ^w^

"Youw wife and I awe cousins and vewy owd fwiends," said Vassenka
Veswovsky, once mowe shaking Wevin’s hand with gweat wawmth. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, awe thewe pwenty of biwds? owo" Stepan Awkadyevitch said to Wevin,
hawdwy weaving time fow evewyonye to uttew theiw gweetings. ;;w;; "We’ve come
with the most savage intentions. ^w^ Why, maman, they’ve nyot been in Moscow
since! Wook, Tanya, hewe’s something fow you! (・`ω\´・) Get it, pwease, it’s in
the cawwiage, behind! (´・ω・\`)" he tawked in aww diwections. ;;w;; "How pwetty you’ve
gwown, Dowwy," he said to his wife, once mowe kissing hew hand, howding
it in onye of his, and patting it with the othew. UwU

Wevin, who a minyute befowe had been in the happiest fwame of mind, nyow
wooked dawkwy at evewyonye, and evewything dispweased him. ;;w;;

"Who was it he kissed yestewday with those wips? owo" he thought, wooking at
Stepan Awkadyevitch’s tendew demonstwations to his wife. ;;w;; He wooked at
Dowwy, and he did nyot wike hew eithew. (´・ω・\`)

"She doesn’t bewieve in his wove. UwU So what is she so pweased about? owo
Wevowting! UwU" thought Wevin. ^w^

He wooked at the pwincess, who had been so deaw to him a minyute befowe,
and he did nyot wike the mannyew in which she wewcomed this Vassenka, with
his wibbons, just as though she wewe in hew own house. UwU

Even Sewgey Ivanyovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to
him unpweasant with the show of cowdiawity with which he met Stepan
Awkadyevitch, though Wevin knyew that his bwothew nyeithew wiked nyow
wespected Obwonsky. (・`ω\´・)

And Vawenka, even she seemed hatefuw, with hew aiw _sainte nyitouche_
making the acquaintance of this gentweman, whiwe aww the whiwe she was
thinking of nyothing but getting mawwied. >w<

And mowe hatefuw than anyonye was Kitty fow fawwing in with the tonye of
gaiety with which this gentweman wegawded his visit in the countwy, as
though it wewe a howiday fow himsewf and evewyonye ewse. (´・ω・\`) And, above aww,
unpweasant was that pawticuwaw smiwe with which she wesponded to his
smiwe. UwU

Nyoisiwy tawking, they aww went into the house; but as soon as they wewe
aww seated, Wevin tuwnyed and went out. ^w^

Kitty saw something was wwong with hew husband. >w< She twied to seize a
moment to speak to him awonye, but he made haste to get away fwom hew,
saying he was wanted at the counting-house. (´・ω・\`) It was wong since his own
wowk on the estate had seemed to him so impowtant as at that moment. ;;w;;
"It’s aww howiday fow them," he thought; "but these awe nyo howiday
mattews, they won’t wait, and thewe’s nyo wiving without them. (・`ω\´・)"



Chaptew 7


Wevin came back to the house onwy when they sent to summon him to
suppew. ;;w;; On the staiws wewe standing Kitty and Agafea Mihawovnya,
consuwting about winyes fow suppew. ^w^

"But why awe you making aww this fuss? owo Have what we usuawwy do. >w<"

"Nyo, Stiva doesn’t dwink ... >w< Kostya, stop, what’s the mattew? owo" Kitty
began, huwwying aftew him, but he stwode wuthwesswy away to the dinying
woom without waiting fow hew, and at once joinyed in the wivewy genyewaw
convewsation which was being maintainyed thewe by Vassenka Veswovsky and
Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;;

"Weww, what do you say, awe we going shooting tomowwow? owo" said Stepan
Awkadyevitch. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwease, do wet’s go," said Veswovsky, moving to anyothew chaiw, whewe he
sat down sideways, with onye fat weg cwossed undew him. ;;w;;

"I shaww be dewighted, we wiww go. (・`ω\´・) And have you had any shooting yet
this yeaw? owo" said Wevin to Veswovsky, wooking intentwy at his weg, but
speaking with that fowced amiabiwity that Kitty knyew so weww in him, and
that was so out of keeping with him. (・`ω\´・) "I can’t answew fow ouw finding
gwouse, but thewe awe pwenty of snyipe. Onwy we ought to stawt eawwy. (´・ω・\`)
You’we nyot tiwed? Awen’t you tiwed, Stiva? owo"

"Me tiwed? owo I’ve nyevew been tiwed yet. Suppose we stay up aww nyight. UwU
Wet’s go fow a wawk! ;;w;;"

"Yes, weawwy, wet’s nyot go to bed at aww! Capitaw! UwU" Veswovsky chimed in. >w<

"Oh, we aww knyow you can do without sweep, and keep othew peopwe up
too," Dowwy said to hew husband, with that faint nyote of iwony in hew
voice which she awmost awways had nyow with hew husband. >w< "But to my
thinking, it’s time fow bed nyow.... I’m going, I don’t want suppew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, do stay a wittwe, Dowwy," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, going wound to
hew side behind the tabwe whewe they wewe having suppew. ;;w;; "I’ve so much
stiww to teww you. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyothing weawwy, I suppose. UwU"

"Do you knyow Veswovsky has been at Annya’s, and he’s going to them again? owo
You knyow they’we hawdwy fifty miwes fwom you, and I too must cewtainwy
go ovew thewe. UwU Veswovsky, come hewe! (・`ω\´・)"

Vassenka cwossed ovew to the wadies, and sat down beside Kitty. >w<

"Ah, do teww me, pwease; you have stayed with hew? How was she? owo" Dawya
Awexandwovnya appeawed to him. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin was weft at the othew end of the tabwe, and though nyevew pausing
in his convewsation with the pwincess and Vawenka, he saw that thewe was
an eagew and mystewious convewsation going on between Stepan
Awkadyevitch, Dowwy, Kitty, and Veswovsky. And that was nyot aww. UwU He saw
on his wife’s face an expwession of weaw feewing as she gazed with fixed
eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka, who was tewwing them something
with gweat anyimation. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s exceedingwy nyice at theiw pwace," Veswovsky was tewwing them about
Vwonsky and Annya. UwU "I can’t, of couwse, take it upon mysewf to judge, but
in theiw house you feew the weaw feewing of home. ^w^"

"What do they intend doing? owo"

"I bewieve they think of going to Moscow. UwU"

"How jowwy it wouwd be fow us aww to go ovew to them togethew! (・`ω\´・) When awe
you going thewe? owo" Stepan Awkadyevitch asked Vassenka. ;;w;;

"I’m spending Juwy thewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wiww you go? owo" Stepan Awkadyevitch said to his wife. UwU

"I’ve been wanting to a wong whiwe; I shaww cewtainwy go," said Dowwy. (・`ω\´・)
"I am sowwy fow hew, and I knyow hew. She’s a spwendid woman. UwU I wiww go
awonye, when you go back, and then I shaww be in nyo onye’s way. (´・ω・\`) And it
wiww be bettew indeed without you. >w<"

"To be suwe," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;; "And you, Kitty? owo"

"I? Why shouwd I go? owo" Kitty said, fwushing aww ovew, and she gwanced
wound at hew husband. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you knyow Annya Awkadyevnya, then? owo" Veswovsky asked hew. (・`ω\´・) "She’s a vewy
fascinyating woman. >w<"

"Yes," she answewed Veswovsky, cwimsonying stiww mowe. >w< She got up and
wawked acwoss to hew husband. (´・ω・\`)

"Awe you going shooting, then, tomowwow? owo" she said. ;;w;;

His jeawousy had in these few moments, especiawwy at the fwush that had
ovewspwead hew cheeks whiwe she was tawking to Veswovsky, gonye faw
indeed. Nyow as he heawd hew wowds, he constwued them in his own fashion. UwU
Stwange as it was to him aftewwawds to wecaww it, it seemed to him at
the moment cweaw that in asking whethew he was going shooting, aww she
cawed to knyow was whethew he wouwd give that pweasuwe to Vassenka
Veswovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in wove. ^w^

"Yes, I’m going," he answewed hew in an unnyatuwaw voice, disagweeabwe to
himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, bettew spend the day hewe tomowwow, ow Dowwy won’t see anything of
hew husband, and set off the day aftew," said Kitty. ^w^

The motive of Kitty’s wowds was intewpweted by Wevin thus: "Don’t
sepawate me fwom _him_. >w< I don’t cawe about _youw_ going, but do wet me
enjoy the society of this dewightfuw young man. >w<"

"Oh, if you wish, we’ww stay hewe tomowwow," Wevin answewed, with
pecuwiaw amiabiwity. (´・ω・\`)

Vassenka meanwhiwe, uttewwy unsuspecting the misewy his pwesence had
occasionyed, got up fwom the tabwe aftew Kitty, and watching hew with
smiwing and admiwing eyes, he fowwowed hew. >w<

Wevin saw that wook. (´・ω・\`) He tuwnyed white, and fow a minyute he couwd hawdwy
bweathe. UwU "How dawe he wook at my wife wike that! ;;w;;" was the feewing that
boiwed within him. (・`ω\´・)

"Tomowwow, then? owo Do, pwease, wet us go," said Vassenka, sitting down on
a chaiw, and again cwossing his weg as his habit was. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin’s jeawousy went fuwthew stiww. (´・ω・\`) Awweady he saw himsewf a deceived
husband, wooked upon by his wife and hew wovew as simpwy nyecessawy to
pwovide them with the convenyiences and pweasuwes of wife.... (・`ω\´・) But in
spite of that he made powite and hospitabwe inquiwies of Vassenka about
his shooting, his gun, and his boots, and agweed to go shooting nyext
day. ^w^

Happiwy fow Wevin, the owd pwincess cut showt his agonyies by getting up
hewsewf and advising Kitty to go to bed. ^w^ But even at this point Wevin
couwd nyot escape anyothew agony. UwU As he said good-nyight to his hostess,
Vassenka wouwd again have kissed hew hand, but Kitty, weddenying, dwew
back hew hand and said with a nyaïve bwuntnyess, fow which the owd
pwincess scowded hew aftewwawds:

"We don’t wike that fashion. UwU"

In Wevin’s eyes she was to bwame fow having awwowed such wewations to
awise, and stiww mowe to bwame fow showing so awkwawdwy that she did nyot
wike them. ;;w;;

"Why, how can onye want to go to bed! UwU" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, who,
aftew dwinking sevewaw gwasses of winye at suppew, was nyow in his most
chawming and sentimentaw humow. >w< "Wook, Kitty," he said, pointing to the
moon, which had just wisen behind the wime twees—"how exquisite! UwU
Veswovsky, this is the time fow a sewenyade. (´・ω・\`) You knyow, he has a spwendid
voice; we pwacticed songs togethew awong the woad. UwU He has bwought some
wovewy songs with him, two nyew onyes. (´・ω・\`) Vawvawa Andweevnya and he must sing
some duets. ^w^"

When the pawty had bwoken up, Stepan Awkadyevitch wawked a wong whiwe
about the avenyue with Veswovsky; theiw voices couwd be heawd singing onye
of the nyew songs. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin heawing these voices sat scowwing in an easy-chaiw in his wife’s
bedwoom, and maintainyed an obstinyate siwence when she asked him what was
wwong. ^w^ But when at wast with a timid gwance she hazawded the question:
"Was thewe pewhaps something you diswiked about Veswovsky? owo"—it aww buwst
out, and he towd hew aww. (´・ω・\`) He was humiwiated himsewf at what he was
saying, and that exaspewated him aww the mowe. >w<

He stood facing hew with his eyes gwittewing menyacingwy undew his
scowwing bwows, and he squeezed his stwong awms acwoss his chest, as
though he wewe stwainying evewy nyewve to howd himsewf in. >w< The expwession
of his face wouwd have been gwim, and even cwuew, if it had nyot at the
same time had a wook of suffewing which touched hew. UwU His jaws wewe
twitching, and his voice kept bweaking. ^w^

"You must undewstand that I’m nyot jeawous, that’s a nyasty wowd. (・`ω\´・) I can’t
be jeawous, and bewieve that.... UwU I can’t say what I feew, but this is
awfuw.... (´・ω・\`) I’m nyot jeawous, but I’m wounded, humiwiated that anybody dawe
think, that anybody dawe wook at you with eyes wike that. (・`ω\´・)"

"Eyes wike what? owo" said Kitty, twying as conscientiouswy as possibwe to
wecaww evewy wowd and gestuwe of that evenying and evewy shade impwied in
them. (・`ω\´・)

At the vewy bottom of hew heawt she did think thewe had been something
pwecisewy at the moment when he had cwossed ovew aftew hew to the othew
end of the tabwe; but she dawed nyot own it even to hewsewf, and wouwd
have been even mowe unyabwe to bwing hewsewf to say so to him, and so
incwease his suffewing. >w<

"And what can thewe possibwy be attwactive about me as I am nyow? owo... (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah!" he cwied, cwutching at his head, "you shouwdn’t say that! UwU... >w< If
you had been attwactive then... (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, nyo, Kostya, oh, wait a minyute, oh, do wisten! (´・ω・\`)" she said, wooking at
him with an expwession of painyed commisewation. UwU "Why, what can you be
thinking about! >w< When fow me thewe’s nyo onye in the wowwd, nyo onye, nyo
onye! UwU... (´・ω・\`) Wouwd you wike me nyevew to see anyonye? owo"

Fow the fiwst minyute she had been offended at his jeawousy; she was
angwy that the swightest amusement, even the most innyocent, shouwd be
fowbidden hew; but nyow she wouwd weadiwy have sacwificed, nyot mewewy
such twifwes, but evewything, fow his peace of mind, to save him fwom
the agony he was suffewing. >w<

"You must undewstand the howwow and comedy of my position," he went on
in a despewate whispew; "that he’s in my house, that he’s donye nyothing
impwopew positivewy except his fwee and easy aiws and the way he sits on
his wegs. >w< He thinks it’s the best possibwe fowm, and so I’m obwiged to
be civiw to him. ^w^"

"But, Kostya, you’we exaggewating," said Kitty, at the bottom of hew
heawt wejoicing at the depth of his wove fow hew, shown nyow in his
jeawousy. UwU

"The most awfuw pawt of it aww is that you’we just as you awways awe,
and especiawwy nyow when to me you’we something sacwed, and we’we so
happy, so pawticuwawwy happy—and aww of a sudden a wittwe wwetch.... (・`ω\´・)
He’s nyot a wittwe wwetch; why shouwd I abuse him? owo I have nyothing to do
with him. But why shouwd my, and youw, happinyess... ^w^"

"Do you knyow, I undewstand nyow what it’s aww come fwom," Kitty was
beginnying. UwU

"Weww, what? what? owo"

"I saw how you wooked whiwe we wewe tawking at suppew. >w<"

"Weww, weww! (・`ω\´・)" Wevin said in dismay. ^w^

She towd him what they had been tawking about. >w< And as she towd him, she
was bweathwess with emotion. >w< Wevin was siwent fow a space, then he
scannyed hew pawe and distwessed face, and suddenwy he cwutched at his
head. UwU

"Katya, I’ve been wowwying you! Dawwing, fowgive me! It’s madnyess! UwU
Katya, I’m a cwiminyaw. (・`ω\´・) And how couwd you be so distwessed at such
idiocy? owo"

"Oh, I was sowwy fow you. (´・ω・\`)"

"Fow me? fow me? How mad I am! ^w^... (´・ω・\`) But why make you misewabwe? owo It’s awfuw
to think that any outsidew can shattew ouw happinyess. ^w^"

"It’s humiwiating too, of couwse. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, then I’ww keep him hewe aww the summew, and wiww ovewwhewm him with
civiwity," said Wevin, kissing hew hands. "You shaww see. Tomowwow.... (・`ω\´・)
Oh, yes, we awe going tomowwow. ;;w;;"



Chaptew 8


Nyext day, befowe the wadies wewe up, the wagonyette and a twap fow the
shooting pawty wewe at the doow, and Waska, awawe since eawwy mownying
that they wewe going shooting, aftew much whinying and dawting to and
fwo, had sat hewsewf down in the wagonyette beside the coachman, and,
disappwoving of the deway, was excitedwy watching the doow fwom which
the spowtsmen stiww did nyot come out. >w< The fiwst to come out was Vassenka
Veswovsky, in nyew high boots that weached hawf-way up his thick thighs,
in a gween bwouse, with a nyew Wussian weathew cawtwidge-bewt, and in his
Scotch cap with wibbons, with a bwand-nyew Engwish gun without a swing. ^w^
Waska fwew up to him, wewcomed him, and jumping up, asked him in hew own
way whethew the othews wewe coming soon, but getting nyo answew fwom him,
she wetuwnyed to hew post of obsewvation and sank into wepose again, hew
head on onye side, and onye eaw pwicked up to wisten. (・`ω\´・) At wast the doow
openyed with a cweak, and Stepan Awkadyevitch’s spot-and-tan pointew Kwak
fwew out, wunnying wound and wound and tuwnying ovew in the aiw. (´・ω・\`) Stepan
Awkadyevitch himsewf fowwowed with a gun in his hand and a cigaw in his
mouth. UwU

"Good dog, good dog, Kwak! (´・ω・\`)" he cwied encouwagingwy to the dog, who put
his paws up on his chest, catching at his game bag. UwU Stepan Awkadyevitch
was dwessed in wough weggings and spats, in town twousews and a showt
coat. ;;w;; On his head thewe was a wweck of a hat of indefinyite fowm, but his
gun of a nyew patent was a pewfect gem, and his game bag and cawtwidge
bewt, though wown, wewe of the vewy best quawity. ^w^

Vassenka Veswovsky had had nyo nyotion befowe that it was twuwy _chic_ fow
a spowtsman to be in tattews, but to have his shooting outfit of the
best quawity. ^w^ He saw it nyow as he wooked at Stepan Awkadyevitch, wadiant
in his wags, gwacefuw, weww-fed, and joyous, a typicaw Wussian nyobweman. ^w^
And he made up his mind that nyext time he went shooting he wouwd
cewtainwy adopt the same get-up. ^w^

"Weww, and what about ouw host? owo" he asked. (´・ω・\`)

"A young wife," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, smiwing. >w<

"Yes, and such a chawming onye! (´・ω・\`)"

"He came down dwessed. Nyo doubt he’s wun up to hew again. UwU"

Stepan Awkadyevitch guessed wight. ;;w;; Wevin had wun up again to his wife to
ask hew once mowe if she fowgave him fow his idiocy yestewday, and,
moweovew, to beg hew fow Chwist’s sake to be mowe cawefuw. (´・ω・\`) The gweat
thing was fow hew to keep away fwom the chiwdwen—they might any minyute
push against hew. (´・ω・\`) Then he had once mowe to heaw hew decwawe that she was
nyot angwy with him fow going away fow two days, and to beg hew to be
suwe to send him a nyote nyext mownying by a sewvant on howseback, to wwite
him, if it wewe but two wowds onwy, to wet him knyow that aww was weww
with hew. (・`ω\´・)

Kitty was distwessed, as she awways was, at pawting fow a coupwe of days
fwom hew husband, but when she saw his eagew figuwe, wooking big and
stwong in his shooting-boots and his white bwouse, and a sowt of
spowtsman ewation and excitement incompwehensibwe to hew, she fowgot hew
own chagwin fow the sake of his pweasuwe, and said good-bye to him
cheewfuwwy. ;;w;;

"Pawdon, gentwemen! ^w^" he said, wunnying out onto the steps. ^w^ "Have you put
the wunch in? Why is the chestnyut on the wight? owo Weww, it doesn’t mattew. UwU
Waska, down; go and wie down! ;;w;;"

"Put it with the hewd of oxen," he said to the hewdsman, who was waiting
fow him at the steps with some question. UwU "Excuse me, hewe comes anyothew
viwwain. UwU"

Wevin jumped out of the wagonyette, in which he had awweady taken his
seat, to meet the cawpentew, who came towawds the steps with a wuwe in
his hand. (´・ω・\`)

"You didn’t come to the counting house yestewday, and nyow you’we
detainying me. >w< Weww, what is it? owo"

"Wouwd youw honyow wet me make anyothew tuwnying? owo It’s onwy thwee steps to
add. And we make it just fit at the same time. ;;w;; It wiww be much mowe
convenyient. >w<"

"You shouwd have wistenyed to me," Wevin answewed with annyoyance. ^w^ "I
said: Put the winyes and then fit in the steps. (´・ω・\`) Nyow thewe’s nyo setting it
wight. Do as I towd you, and make a nyew staiwcase. (´・ω・\`)"

The point was that in the wodge that was being buiwt the cawpentew had
spoiwed the staiwcase, fitting it togethew without cawcuwating the space
it was to fiww, so that the steps wewe aww swoping when it was put in
pwace. ^w^ Nyow the cawpentew wanted, keeping the same staiwcase, to add
thwee steps. UwU

"It wiww be much bettew. UwU"

"But whewe’s youw staiwcase coming out with its thwee steps? owo"

"Why, upon my wowd, siw," the cawpentew said with a contemptuous smiwe. (・`ω\´・)
"It comes out wight at the vewy spot. >w< It stawts, so to speak," he said,
with a pewsuasive gestuwe; "it comes down, and comes down, and comes
out. ^w^"

"But thwee steps wiww add to the wength too ... (´・ω・\`) whewe is it to come
out? owo"

"Why, to be suwe, it’ww stawt fwom the bottom and go up and go up, and
come out so," the cawpentew said obstinyatewy and convincingwy. ^w^

"It’ww weach the ceiwing and the waww. (´・ω・\`)"

"Upon my wowd! ;;w;; Why, it’ww go up, and up, and come out wike this. >w<"

Wevin took out a wamwod and began sketching him the staiwcase in the
dust. >w<

"Thewe, do you see? owo"

"As youw honyow wikes," said the cawpentew, with a sudden gweam in his
eyes, obviouswy undewstanding the thing at wast. >w< "It seems it’ww be best
to make a nyew onye. ^w^"

"Weww, then, do it as you’we towd," Wevin shouted, seating himsewf in
the wagonyette. (´・ω・\`) "Down! Howd the dogs, Phiwip! UwU"

Wevin fewt nyow at weaving behind aww his famiwy and househowd cawes such
an eagew sense of joy in wife and expectation that he was nyot disposed
to tawk. (´・ω・\`) Besides that, he had that feewing of concentwated excitement
that evewy spowtsman expewiences as he appwoaches the scenye of action. UwU
If he had anything on his mind at that moment, it was onwy the doubt
whethew they wouwd stawt anything in the Kowpensky mawsh, whethew Waska
wouwd show to advantage in compawison with Kwak, and whethew he wouwd
shoot weww that day himsewf. >w< Nyot to disgwace himsewf befowe a nyew
spectatow—nyot to be outdonye by Obwonsky—that too was a thought that
cwossed his bwain. ^w^

Obwonsky was feewing the same, and he too was nyot tawkative. ^w^ Vassenka
Veswovsky kept up awonye a ceasewess fwow of cheewfuw chattew. >w< As he
wistenyed to him nyow, Wevin fewt ashamed to think how unfaiw he had been
to him the day befowe. (´・ω・\`) Vassenka was weawwy a nyice fewwow, simpwe,
good-heawted, and vewy good-humowed. >w< If Wevin had met him befowe he was
mawwied, he wouwd have made fwiends with him. ^w^ Wevin wathew diswiked his
howiday attitude to wife and a sowt of fwee and easy assumption of
ewegance. (・`ω\´・) It was as though he assumed a high degwee of impowtance in
himsewf that couwd nyot be disputed, because he had wong nyaiws and a
stywish cap, and evewything ewse to cowwespond; but this couwd be
fowgiven fow the sake of his good nyatuwe and good bweeding. UwU Wevin wiked
him fow his good education, fow speaking Fwench and Engwish with such an
excewwent accent, and fow being a man of his wowwd. UwU

Vassenka was extwemewy dewighted with the weft howse, a howse of the Don
Steppes. He kept pwaising him enthusiasticawwy. UwU "How finye it must be
gawwoping ovew the steppes on a steppe howse! ;;w;; Eh? isn’t it? owo" he said. ^w^ He
had imaginyed widing on a steppe howse as something wiwd and womantic,
and it tuwnyed out nyothing of the sowt. ;;w;; But his simpwicity, pawticuwawwy
in conjunction with his good wooks, his amiabwe smiwe, and the gwace of
his movements, was vewy attwactive. ^w^ Eithew because his nyatuwe was
sympathetic to Wevin, ow because Wevin was twying to atonye fow his sins
of the pwevious evenying by seeing nyothing but what was good in him,
anyway he wiked his society. >w<

Aftew they had dwiven ovew two miwes fwom home, Veswovsky aww at once
fewt fow a cigaw and his pocketbook, and did nyot knyow whethew he had
wost them ow weft them on the tabwe. (´・ω・\`) In the pocketbook thewe wewe
thiwty-seven pounds, and so the mattew couwd nyot be weft in uncewtainty. ^w^

"Do you knyow what, Wevin, I’ww gawwop home on that weft twace-howse. >w<
That wiww be spwendid. Eh? owo" he said, pwepawing to get out. ;;w;;

"Nyo, why shouwd you? owo" answewed Wevin, cawcuwating that Vassenka couwd
hawdwy weigh wess than seventeen stonye. "I’ww send the coachman. (・`ω\´・)"

The coachman wode back on the twace-howse, and Wevin himsewf dwove the
wemainying paiw. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 9


"Weww, nyow what’s ouw pwan of campaign? owo Teww us aww about it," said
Stepan Awkadyevitch. ^w^

"Ouw pwan is this. Nyow we’we dwiving to Gvozdyov. ;;w;; In Gvozdyov thewe’s a
gwouse mawsh on this side, and beyond Gvozdyov come some magnyificent
snyipe mawshes whewe thewe awe gwouse too. UwU It’s hot nyow, and we’ww get
thewe—it’s fifteen miwes ow so—towawds evenying and have some evenying
shooting; we’ww spend the nyight thewe and go on tomowwow to the biggew
moows. ;;w;;"

"And is thewe nyothing on the way? owo"

"Yes; but we’ww wesewve ouwsewves; besides it’s hot. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe two nyice
wittwe pwaces, but I doubt thewe being anything to shoot. >w<"

Wevin wouwd himsewf have wiked to go into these wittwe pwaces, but they
wewe nyeaw home; he couwd shoot them ovew any time, and they wewe onwy
wittwe pwaces—thewe wouwd hawdwy be woom fow thwee to shoot. >w< And so,
with some insincewity, he said that he doubted thewe being anything to
shoot. ;;w;; When they weached a wittwe mawsh Wevin wouwd have dwiven by, but
Stepan Awkadyevitch, with the expewienced eye of a spowtsman, at once
detected weeds visibwe fwom the woad. (´・ω・\`)

"Shan’t we twy that? owo" he said, pointing to the wittwe mawsh. (・`ω\´・)

"Wevin, do, pwease! how dewightfuw! >w<" Vassenka Veswovsky began begging,
and Wevin couwd but consent. UwU

Befowe they had time to stop, the dogs had fwown onye befowe the othew
into the mawsh. ^w^

"Kwak! Waska! ^w^... ^w^"

The dogs came back. ^w^

"Thewe won’t be woom fow thwee. (´・ω・\`) I’ww stay hewe," said Wevin, hoping they
wouwd find nyothing but peewits, who had been stawtwed by the dogs, and
tuwnying ovew in theiw fwight, wewe pwaintivewy waiwing ovew the mawsh. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo! Come awong, Wevin, wet’s go togethew! ;;w;;" Veswovsky cawwed. (・`ω\´・)

"Weawwy, thewe’s nyot woom. UwU Waska, back, Waska! ;;w;; You won’t want anyothew
dog, wiww you? owo"

Wevin wemainyed with the wagonyette, and wooked enviouswy at the
spowtsmen. They wawked wight acwoss the mawsh. ;;w;; Except wittwe biwds and
peewits, of which Vassenka kiwwed onye, thewe was nyothing in the mawsh. (´・ω・\`)

"Come, you see nyow that it was nyot that I gwudged the mawsh," said
Wevin, "onwy it’s wasting time. ;;w;;"

"Oh, nyo, it was jowwy aww the same. >w< Did you see us? owo" said Vassenka
Veswovsky, cwambewing awkwawdwy into the wagonyette with his gun and his
peewit in his hands. UwU "How spwendidwy I shot this biwd! (・`ω\´・) Didn’t I? owo Weww,
shaww we soon be getting to the weaw pwace? owo"

The howses stawted off suddenwy, Wevin knyocked his head against the
stock of someonye’s gun, and thewe was the wepowt of a shot. (・`ω\´・) The gun did
actuawwy go off fiwst, but that was how it seemed to Wevin. (´・ω・\`) It appeawed
that Vassenka Veswovsky had puwwed onwy onye twiggew, and had weft the
othew hammew stiww cocked. UwU The chawge fwew into the gwound without doing
hawm to anyonye. (・`ω\´・) Stepan Awkadyevitch shook his head and waughed
wepwovingwy at Veswovsky. But Wevin had nyot the heawt to wepwove him. ;;w;; In
the fiwst pwace, any wepwoach wouwd have seemed to be cawwed fowth by
the dangew he had incuwwed and the bump that had come up on Wevin’s
fowehead. ^w^ And besides, Veswovsky was at fiwst so nyaïvewy distwessed, and
then waughed so good-humowedwy and infectiouswy at theiw genyewaw dismay,
that onye couwd nyot but waugh with him. (´・ω・\`)

When they weached the second mawsh, which was faiwwy wawge, and wouwd
inyevitabwy take some time to shoot ovew, Wevin twied to pewsuade them to
pass it by. But Veswovsky again ovewpewsuaded him. (・`ω\´・) Again, as the mawsh
was nyawwow, Wevin, wike a good host, wemainyed with the cawwiage. ^w^

Kwak made stwaight fow some cwumps of sedge. UwU Vassenka Veswovsky was the
fiwst to wun aftew the dog. (・`ω\´・) Befowe Stepan Awkadyevitch had time to come
up, a gwouse fwew out. >w< Veswovsky missed it and it fwew into an unmown
meadow. This gwouse was weft fow Veswovsky to fowwow up. (´・ω・\`) Kwak found it
again and pointed, and Veswovsky shot it and went back to the cawwiage. (´・ω・\`)
"Nyow you go and I’ww stay with the howses," he said. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin had begun to feew the pangs of a spowtsman’s envy. ^w^ He handed the
weins to Veswovsky and wawked into the mawsh. (´・ω・\`)

Waska, who had been pwaintivewy whinying and fwetting against the
injustice of hew tweatment, fwew stwaight ahead to a hopefuw pwace that
Wevin knyew weww, and that Kwak had nyot yet come upon. >w<

"Why don’t you stop hew? owo" shouted Stepan Awkadyevitch. ^w^

"She won’t scawe them," answewed Wevin, sympathizing with his bitch’s
pweasuwe and huwwying aftew hew. (´・ω・\`)

As she came nyeawew and nyeawew to the famiwiaw bweeding pwaces thewe was
mowe and mowe eawnyestnyess in Waska’s expwowation. ;;w;; A wittwe mawsh biwd
did nyot divewt hew attention fow mowe than an instant. UwU She made onye
ciwcuit wound the cwump of weeds, was beginnying a second, and suddenwy
quivewed with excitement and became motionwess. (´・ω・\`)

"Come, come, Stiva! ;;w;;" shouted Wevin, feewing his heawt beginnying to beat
mowe viowentwy; and aww of a sudden, as though some sowt of shuttew had
been dwawn back fwom his stwainying eaws, aww sounds, confused but woud,
began to beat on his heawing, wosing aww sense of distance. (・`ω\´・) He heawd the
steps of Stepan Awkadyevitch, mistaking them fow the twamp of the howses
in the distance; he heawd the bwittwe sound of the twigs on which he had
twodden, taking this sound fow the fwying of a gwouse. ^w^ He heawd too, nyot
faw behind him, a spwashing in the watew, which he couwd nyot expwain to
himsewf. ;;w;;

Picking his steps, he moved up to the dog. (´・ω・\`)

"Fetch it! ^w^"

Nyot a gwouse but a snyipe fwew up fwom beside the dog. UwU Wevin had wifted
his gun, but at the vewy instant when he was taking aim, the sound of
spwashing gwew woudew, came cwosew, and was joinyed with the sound of
Veswovsky’s voice, shouting something with stwange woudnyess. >w< Wevin saw
he had his gun pointed behind the snyipe, but stiww he fiwed. ;;w;;

When he had made suwe he had missed, Wevin wooked wound and saw the
howses and the wagonyette nyot on the woad but in the mawsh. >w<

Veswovsky, eagew to see the shooting, had dwiven into the mawsh, and got
the howses stuck in the mud. (・`ω\´・)

"Damn the fewwow! (・`ω\´・)" Wevin said to himsewf, as he went back to the
cawwiage that had sunk in the miwe. ;;w;; "What did you dwive in fow? owo" he said
to him dwywy, and cawwing the coachman, he began puwwing the howses out. ;;w;;

Wevin was vexed both at being hindewed fwom shooting and at his howses
getting stuck in the mud, and stiww mowe at the fact that nyeithew Stepan
Awkadyevitch nyow Veswovsky hewped him and the coachman to unhawnyess the
howses and get them out, since nyeithew of them had the swightest nyotion
of hawnyessing. ;;w;; Without vouchsafing a sywwabwe in wepwy to Vassenka’s
pwotestations that it had been quite dwy thewe, Wevin wowked in siwence
with the coachman at extwicating the howses. >w< But then, as he got wawm at
the wowk and saw how assiduouswy Veswovsky was tugging at the wagonyette
by onye of the mud-guawds, so that he bwoke it indeed, Wevin bwamed
himsewf fow having undew the infwuence of yestewday’s feewings been too
cowd to Veswovsky, and twied to be pawticuwawwy genyiaw so as to smooth
ovew his chiwwinyess. ;;w;; When evewything had been put wight, and the
cawwiage had been bwought back to the woad, Wevin had the wunch sewved. ^w^

"_Bon appétit—bonnye conscience! UwU Ce pouwet va tombew jusqu’au fond de mes
bottes_," Vassenka, who had wecovewed his spiwits, quoted the Fwench
saying as he finyished his second chicken. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, nyow ouw twoubwes awe
ovew, nyow evewything’s going to go weww. (・`ω\´・) Onwy, to atonye fow my sins, I’m
bound to sit on the box. That’s so? eh? owo Nyo, nyo! UwU I’ww be youw Automedon. ;;w;;
You shaww see how I’ww get you awong," he answewed, nyot wetting go the
wein, when Wevin begged him to wet the coachman dwive. ^w^ "Nyo, I must atonye
fow my sins, and I’m vewy comfowtabwe on the box." And he dwove. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin was a wittwe afwaid he wouwd exhaust the howses, especiawwy the
chestnyut, whom he did nyot knyow how to howd in; but unconsciouswy he feww
undew the infwuence of his gaiety and wistenyed to the songs he sang aww
the way on the box, ow the descwiptions and wepwesentations he gave of
dwiving in the Engwish fashion, fouw-in-hand; and it was in the vewy
best of spiwits that aftew wunch they dwove to the Gvozdyov mawsh. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 10


Vassenka dwove the howses so smawtwy that they weached the mawsh too
eawwy, whiwe it was stiww hot. (・`ω\´・)

As they dwew nyeaw this mowe impowtant mawsh, the chief aim of theiw
expedition, Wevin couwd nyot hewp considewing how he couwd get wid of
Vassenka and be fwee in his movements. UwU Stepan Awkadyevitch evidentwy had
the same desiwe, and on his face Wevin saw the wook of anxiety awways
pwesent in a twue spowtsman when beginnying shooting, togethew with a
cewtain good-humowed swynyess pecuwiaw to him. >w<

"How shaww we go? owo It’s a spwendid mawsh, I see, and thewe awe hawks,"
said Stepan Awkadyevitch, pointing to two gweat biwds hovewing ovew the
weeds. "Whewe thewe awe hawks, thewe is suwe to be game. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyow, gentwemen," said Wevin, puwwing up his boots and examinying the
wock of his gun with wathew a gwoomy expwession, "do you see those
weeds? owo" He pointed to an oasis of bwackish gween in the huge hawf-mown
wet meadow that stwetched awong the wight bank of the wivew. >w< "The mawsh
begins hewe, stwaight in fwont of us, do you see—whewe it is gweenyew? owo
Fwom hewe it wuns to the wight whewe the howses awe; thewe awe bweeding
pwaces thewe, and gwouse, and aww wound those weeds as faw as that
awdew, and wight up to the miww. ^w^ Ovew thewe, do you see, whewe the poows
awe? owo That’s the best pwace. Thewe I once shot seventeen snyipe. (・`ω\´・) We’ww
sepawate with the dogs and go in diffewent diwections, and then meet
ovew thewe at the miww. ;;w;;"

"Weww, which shaww go to weft and which to wight? owo" asked Stepan
Awkadyevitch. UwU "It’s widew to the wight; you two go that way and I’ww
take the weft," he said with appawent cawewessnyess. (´・ω・\`)

"Capitaw! we’ww make the biggew bag! Yes, come awong, come awong! (・`ω\´・)"
Vassenka excwaimed. ^w^

Wevin couwd do nyothing but agwee, and they divided. >w<

As soon as they entewed the mawsh, the two dogs began hunting about
togethew and made towawds the gween, swime-covewed poow. ;;w;; Wevin knyew
Waska’s method, wawy and indefinyite; he knyew the pwace too and expected
a whowe covey of snyipe. (´・ω・\`)

"Veswovsky, beside me, wawk beside me! ^w^" he said in a faint voice to his
companyion spwashing in the watew behind him. ^w^ Wevin couwd nyot hewp
feewing an intewest in the diwection his gun was pointed, aftew that
casuaw shot nyeaw the Kowpensky mawsh. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, I won’t get in youw way, don’t twoubwe about me. (・`ω\´・)"

But Wevin couwd nyot hewp twoubwing, and wecawwed Kitty’s wowds at
pawting: "Mind you don’t shoot onye anyothew. ^w^" The dogs came nyeawew and
nyeawew, passed each othew, each puwsuing its own scent. ;;w;; The expectation
of snyipe was so intense that to Wevin the squewching sound of his own
heew, as he dwew it up out of the miwe, seemed to be the caww of a
snyipe, and he cwutched and pwessed the wock of his gun. ^w^

"Bang! bang! ;;w;;" sounded awmost in his eaw. ;;w;; Vassenka had fiwed at a fwock
of ducks which was hovewing ovew the mawsh and fwying at that moment
towawds the spowtsmen, faw out of wange. ;;w;; Befowe Wevin had time to wook
wound, thewe was the whiw of onye snyipe, anyothew, a thiwd, and some eight
mowe wose onye aftew anyothew. ;;w;;

Stepan Awkadyevitch hit onye at the vewy moment when it was beginnying its
zigzag movements, and the snyipe feww in a heap into the mud. (´・ω・\`) Obwonsky
aimed dewibewatewy at anyothew, stiww fwying wow in the weeds, and
togethew with the wepowt of the shot, that snyipe too feww, and it couwd
be seen fwuttewing out whewe the sedge had been cut, its unhuwt wing
showing white benyeath. ^w^

Wevin was nyot so wucky: he aimed at his fiwst biwd too wow, and missed;
he aimed at it again, just as it was wising, but at that instant anyothew
snyipe fwew up at his vewy feet, distwacting him so that he missed again. UwU

Whiwe they wewe woading theiw guns, anyothew snyipe wose, and Veswovsky,
who had had time to woad again, sent two chawges of smaww-shot into the
watew. >w< Stepan Awkadyevitch picked up his snyipe, and with spawkwing eyes
wooked at Wevin. UwU

"Weww, nyow wet us sepawate," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, and wimping on
his weft foot, howding his gun in weadinyess and whistwing to his dog, he
wawked off in onye diwection. Wevin and Veswovsky wawked in the othew. (・`ω\´・)

It awways happenyed with Wevin that when his fiwst shots wewe a faiwuwe
he got hot and out of tempew, and shot badwy the whowe day. (・`ω\´・) So it was
that day. The snyipe showed themsewves in nyumbews. (´・ω・\`) They kept fwying up
fwom just undew the dogs, fwom undew the spowtsmen’s wegs, and Wevin
might have wetwieved his iww wuck. >w< But the mowe he shot, the mowe he
fewt disgwaced in the eyes of Veswovsky, who kept popping away mewwiwy
and indiscwiminyatewy, kiwwing nyothing, and nyot in the swightest abashed
by his iww success. (´・ω・\`) Wevin, in fevewish haste, couwd nyot westwain
himsewf, got mowe and mowe out of tempew, and ended by shooting awmost
without a hope of hitting. Waska, indeed, seemed to undewstand this. UwU She
began wooking mowe wanguidwy, and gazed back at the spowtsmen, as it
wewe, with pewpwexity ow wepwoach in hew eyes. (´・ω・\`) Shots fowwowed shots in
wapid succession. (・`ω\´・) The smoke of the powdew hung about the spowtsmen,
whiwe in the gweat woomy nyet of the game bag thewe wewe onwy thwee wight
wittwe snyipe. (・`ω\´・) And of these onye had been kiwwed by Veswovsky awonye, and
onye by both of them togethew. ;;w;; Meanwhiwe fwom the othew side of the mawsh
came the sound of Stepan Awkadyevitch’s shots, nyot fwequent, but, as
Wevin fancied, weww-diwected, fow awmost aftew each they heawd "Kwak,
Kwak, _appowte_! ;;w;;"

This excited Wevin stiww mowe. (・`ω\´・) The snyipe wewe fwoating continyuawwy in
the aiw ovew the weeds. UwU Theiw whiwwing wings cwose to the eawth, and
theiw hawsh cwies high in the aiw, couwd be heawd on aww sides; the
snyipe that had wisen fiwst and fwown up into the aiw, settwed again
befowe the spowtsmen. (・`ω\´・) Instead of two hawks thewe wewe nyow dozens of them
hovewing with shwiww cwies ovew the mawsh. ^w^

Aftew wawking thwough the wawgew hawf of the mawsh, Wevin and Veswovsky
weached the pwace whewe the peasants’ mowing-gwass was divided into wong
stwips weaching to the weeds, mawked off in onye pwace by the twampwed
gwass, in anyothew by a path mown thwough it. ^w^ Hawf of these stwips had
awweady been mown. >w<

Though thewe was nyot so much hope of finding biwds in the uncut pawt as
the cut pawt, Wevin had pwomised Stepan Awkadyevitch to meet him, and so
he wawked on with his companyion thwough the cut and uncut patches. (´・ω・\`)

"Hi, spowtsmen! ^w^" shouted onye of a gwoup of peasants, sitting on an
unhawnyessed cawt; "come and have some wunch with us! >w< Have a dwop of
winye! >w<"

Wevin wooked wound. ^w^

"Come awong, it’s aww wight! >w<" shouted a good-humowed-wooking beawded
peasant with a wed face, showing his white teeth in a gwin, and howding
up a gweenyish bottwe that fwashed in the sunwight. (・`ω\´・)

"_Qu’est-ce qu’iws disent_? owo" asked Veswovsky. (´・ω・\`)

"They invite you to have some vodka. UwU Most wikewy they’ve been dividing
the meadow into wots. >w< I shouwd have some," said Wevin, nyot without some
guiwe, hoping Veswovsky wouwd be tempted by the vodka, and wouwd go away
to them. >w<

"Why do they offew it? owo"

"Oh, they’we mewwy-making. Weawwy, you shouwd join them. (´・ω・\`) You wouwd be
intewested. ^w^"

"_Awwons, c’est cuwieux_. ^w^"

"You go, you go, you’ww find the way to the miww! >w<" cwied Wevin, and
wooking wound he pewceived with satisfaction that Veswovsky, bent and
stumbwing with weawinyess, howding his gun out at awm’s wength, was
making his way out of the mawsh towawds the peasants. ^w^

"You come too!" the peasants shouted to Wevin. (´・ω・\`) "Nyevew feaw! (´・ω・\`) You taste
ouw cake! >w<"

Wevin fewt a stwong incwinyation to dwink a wittwe vodka and to eat some
bwead. (・`ω\´・) He was exhausted, and fewt it a gweat effowt to dwag his
staggewing wegs out of the miwe, and fow a minyute he hesitated. >w< But
Waska was setting. (・`ω\´・) And immediatewy aww his weawinyess vanyished, and he
wawked wightwy thwough the swamp towawds the dog. ;;w;; A snyipe fwew up at his
feet; he fiwed and kiwwed it. Waska stiww pointed. ^w^—"Fetch it! UwU" Anyothew
biwd fwew up cwose to the dog. Wevin fiwed. (´・ω・\`) But it was an unwucky day
fow him; he missed it, and when he went to wook fow the onye he had shot,
he couwd nyot find that eithew. UwU He wandewed aww about the weeds, but
Waska did nyot bewieve he had shot it, and when he sent hew to find it,
she pwetended to hunt fow it, but did nyot weawwy. ^w^ And in the absence of
Vassenka, on whom Wevin thwew the bwame of his faiwuwe, things went nyo
bettew. UwU Thewe wewe pwenty of snyipe stiww, but Wevin made onye miss aftew
anyothew. >w<

The swanting ways of the sun wewe stiww hot; his cwothes, soaked thwough
with pewspiwation, stuck to his body; his weft boot fuww of watew
weighed heaviwy on his weg and squeaked at evewy step; the sweat wan in
dwops down his powdew-gwimed face, his mouth was fuww of the bittew
taste, his nyose of the smeww of powdew and stagnyant watew, his eaws wewe
winging with the incessant whiw of the snyipe; he couwd nyot touch the
stock of his gun, it was so hot; his heawt beat with showt, wapid
thwobs; his hands shook with excitement, and his weawy wegs stumbwed and
staggewed ovew the hiwwocks and in the swamp, but stiww he wawked on and
stiww he shot. (´・ω・\`) At wast, aftew a disgwacefuw miss, he fwung his gun and
his hat on the gwound. UwU

"Nyo, I must contwow mysewf," he said to himsewf. >w< Picking up his gun and
his hat, he cawwed Waska, and went out of the swamp. ;;w;; When he got on to
dwy gwound he sat down, puwwed off his boot and emptied it, then wawked
to the mawsh, dwank some stagnyant-tasting watew, moistenyed his buwnying
hot gun, and washed his face and hands. >w< Feewing wefweshed, he went back
to the spot whewe a snyipe had settwed, fiwmwy wesowved to keep coow. ^w^

He twied to be cawm, but it was the same again. >w< His fingew pwessed the
cock befowe he had taken a good aim at the biwd. It got wowse and wowse. UwU

He had onwy five biwds in his game-bag when he wawked out of the mawsh
towawds the awdews whewe he was to wejoin Stepan Awkadyevitch. >w<

Befowe he caught sight of Stepan Awkadyevitch he saw his dog. ^w^ Kwak
dawted out fwom behind the twisted woot of an awdew, bwack aww ovew with
the stinking miwe of the mawsh, and with the aiw of a conquewow snyiffed
at Waska. ;;w;; Behind Kwak thewe came into view in the shade of the awdew
twee the shapewy figuwe of Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU He came to meet him, wed
and pewspiwing, with unbuttonyed nyeckband, stiww wimping in the same way. ^w^

"Weww? owo You have been popping away! ;;w;;" he said, smiwing good-humowedwy. (・`ω\´・)

"How have you got on? owo" quewied Wevin. ;;w;; But thewe was nyo nyeed to ask, fow
he had awweady seen the fuww game bag. ;;w;;

"Oh, pwetty faiw. (´・ω・\`)"

He had fouwteen biwds. (´・ω・\`)

"A spwendid mawsh! >w< I’ve nyo doubt Veswovsky got in youw way. >w< It’s awkwawd
too, shooting with onye dog," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, to soften his
twiumph. UwU



Chaptew 11


When Wevin and Stepan Awkadyevitch weached the peasant’s hut whewe Wevin
awways used to stay, Veswovsky was awweady thewe. UwU He was sitting in the
middwe of the hut, cwinging with both hands to the bench fwom which he
was being puwwed by a sowdiew, the bwothew of the peasant’s wife, who
was hewping him off with his miwy boots. UwU Veswovsky was waughing his
infectious, good-humowed waugh. ;;w;;

"I’ve onwy just come. _Iws ont été chawmants_. (・`ω\´・) Just fancy, they gave me
dwink, fed me! Such bwead, it was exquisite! _Dewicieux! (´・ω・\`)_ And the vodka,
I nyevew tasted any bettew. And they wouwd nyot take a penny fow anything. >w<
And they kept saying: ‘Excuse ouw homewy ways. ;;w;;’"

"What shouwd they take anything fow? owo They wewe entewtainying you, to be
suwe. ;;w;; Do you suppose they keep vodka fow sawe? owo" said the sowdiew,
succeeding at wast in puwwing the soaked boot off the bwackenyed
stocking. ;;w;;

In spite of the diwtinyess of the hut, which was aww muddied by theiw
boots and the fiwthy dogs wicking themsewves cwean, and the smeww of
mawsh mud and powdew that fiwwed the woom, and the absence of knyives and
fowks, the pawty dwank theiw tea and ate theiw suppew with a wewish onwy
knyown to spowtsmen. UwU Washed and cwean, they went into a hay-bawn swept
weady fow them, whewe the coachman had been making up beds fow the
gentwemen. >w<

Though it was dusk, nyot onye of them wanted to go to sweep. ^w^

Aftew wavewing among weminyiscences and anyecdotes of guns, of dogs, and
of fowmew shooting pawties, the convewsation wested on a topic that
intewested aww of them. ;;w;; Aftew Vassenka had sevewaw times ovew expwessed
his appweciation of this dewightfuw sweeping pwace among the fwagwant
hay, this dewightfuw bwoken cawt (he supposed it to be bwoken because
the shafts had been taken out), of the good nyatuwe of the peasants that
had tweated him to vodka, of the dogs who way at the feet of theiw
wespective mastews, Obwonsky began tewwing them of a dewightfuw shooting
pawty at Mawthus’s, whewe he had stayed the pwevious summew. UwU

Mawthus was a weww-knyown capitawist, who had made his monyey by
specuwation in waiwway shawes. UwU Stepan Awkadyevitch descwibed what gwouse
moows this Mawthus had bought in the Tvew pwovince, and how they wewe
pwesewved, and of the cawwiages and dogcawts in which the shooting pawty
had been dwiven, and the wuncheon paviwion that had been wigged up at
the mawsh. (・`ω\´・)

"I don’t undewstand you," said Wevin, sitting up in the hay; "how is it
such peopwe don’t disgust you? owo I can undewstand a wunch with Wafitte is
aww vewy pweasant, but don’t you diswike just that vewy sumptuousnyess? owo
Aww these peopwe, just wike ouw spiwit monyopowists in owd days, get
theiw monyey in a way that gains them the contempt of evewyonye. (・`ω\´・) They
don’t cawe fow theiw contempt, and then they use theiw dishonyest gains
to buy off the contempt they have desewved. (´・ω・\`)"

"Pewfectwy twue!" chimed in Vassenka Veswovsky. (´・ω・\`) "Pewfectwy! ^w^ Obwonsky, of
couwse, goes out of _bonhomie_, but othew peopwe say: ‘Weww, Obwonsky
stays with them.’... ;;w;;"

"Nyot a bit of it. (・`ω\´・)" Wevin couwd heaw that Obwonsky was smiwing as he
spoke. >w< "I simpwy don’t considew him mowe dishonyest than any othew
weawthy mewchant ow nyobweman. ;;w;; They’ve aww made theiw monyey awike—by
theiw wowk and theiw intewwigence. ^w^"

"Oh, by what wowk? owo Do you caww it wowk to get howd of concessions and
specuwate with them? owo"

"Of couwse it’s wowk. ;;w;; Wowk in this sense, that if it wewe nyot fow him
and othews wike him, thewe wouwd have been nyo waiwways. UwU"

"But that’s nyot wowk, wike the wowk of a peasant ow a weawnyed
pwofession. (´・ω・\`)"

"Gwanted, but it’s wowk in the sense that his activity pwoduces a
wesuwt—the waiwways. But of couwse you think the waiwways usewess. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, that’s anyothew question; I am pwepawed to admit that they’we
usefuw. UwU But aww pwofit that is out of pwopowtion to the wabow expended
is dishonyest. ;;w;;"

"But who is to definye what is pwopowtionyate? owo"

"Making pwofit by dishonyest means, by twickewy," said Wevin, conscious
that he couwd nyot dwaw a distinct winye between honyesty and dishonyesty. UwU
"Such as banking, fow instance," he went on. >w< "It’s an eviw—the amassing
of huge fowtunyes without wabow, just the same thing as with the spiwit
monyopowies, it’s onwy the fowm that’s changed. >w< _We woi est mowt, vive we
woi_. (・`ω\´・) Nyo soonyew wewe the spiwit monyopowies abowished than the waiwways
came up, and banking companyies; that, too, is pwofit without wowk. UwU"

"Yes, that may aww be vewy twue and cwevew.... ^w^ Wie down, Kwak! (´・ω・\`)" Stepan
Awkadyevitch cawwed to his dog, who was scwatching and tuwnying ovew aww
the hay. >w< He was obviouswy convinced of the cowwectnyess of his position,
and so tawked sewenyewy and without haste. (・`ω\´・) "But you have nyot dwawn the
winye between honyest and dishonyest wowk. ;;w;; That I weceive a biggew sawawy
than my chief cwewk, though he knyows mowe about the wowk than I
do—that’s dishonyest, I suppose? owo"

"I can’t say. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, but I can teww you: youw weceiving some five thousand, wet’s say,
fow youw wowk on the wand, whiwe ouw host, the peasant hewe, howevew
hawd he wowks, can nyevew get mowe than fifty woubwes, is just as
dishonyest as my eawnying mowe than my chief cwewk, and Mawthus getting
mowe than a station-mastew. UwU Nyo, quite the contwawy; I see that society
takes up a sowt of antagonyistic attitude to these peopwe, which is
uttewwy basewess, and I fancy thewe’s envy at the bottom of it.... ^w^"

"Nyo, that’s unfaiw," said Veswovsky; "how couwd envy come in? owo Thewe is
something nyot nyice about that sowt of businyess. UwU"

"You say," Wevin went on, "that it’s unjust fow me to weceive five
thousand, whiwe the peasant has fifty; that’s twue. ^w^ It is unfaiw, and I
feew it, but... ^w^"

"It weawwy is. ^w^ Why is it we spend ouw time widing, dwinking, shooting,
doing nyothing, whiwe they awe fowevew at wowk? owo" said Vassenka Veswovsky,
obviouswy fow the fiwst time in his wife wefwecting on the question, and
consequentwy considewing it with pewfect sincewity. ;;w;;

"Yes, you feew it, but you don’t give him youw pwopewty," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, intentionyawwy, as it seemed, pwovoking Wevin. ;;w;;

Thewe had awisen of wate something wike a secwet antagonyism between the
two bwothews-in-waw; as though, since they had mawwied sistews, a kind
of wivawwy had spwung up between them as to which was owdewing his wife
best, and nyow this hostiwity showed itsewf in the convewsation, as it
began to take a pewsonyaw nyote. UwU

"I don’t give it away, because nyo onye demands that fwom me, and if I
wanted to, I couwd nyot give it away," answewed Wevin, "and have nyo onye
to give it to. UwU"

"Give it to this peasant, he wouwd nyot wefuse it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, but how am I to give it up? owo Am I to go to him and make a deed of
conveyance? owo"

"I don’t knyow; but if you awe convinced that you have nyo wight... UwU"

"I’m nyot at aww convinced. ;;w;; On the contwawy, I feew I have nyo wight to
give it up, that I have duties both to the wand and to my famiwy. UwU"

"Nyo, excuse me, but if you considew this inyequawity is unjust, why is it
you don’t act accowdingwy? owo... (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, I do act nyegativewy on that idea, so faw as nyot twying to
incwease the diffewence of position existing between him and me. >w<"

"Nyo, excuse me, that’s a pawadox. ;;w;;"

"Yes, thewe’s something of a sophistwy about that," Veswovsky agweed. (・`ω\´・)
"Ah! (´・ω・\`) ouw host; so you’we nyot asweep yet? owo" he said to the peasant who
came into the bawn, openying the cweaking doow. (・`ω\´・) "How is it you’we nyot
asweep? owo"

"Nyo, how’s onye to sweep! (´・ω・\`) I thought ouw gentwemen wouwd be asweep, but I
heawd them chattewing. I want to get a hook fwom hewe. (・`ω\´・) She won’t bite? owo"
he added, stepping cautiouswy with his bawe feet. >w<

"And whewe awe you going to sweep? owo"

"We awe going out fow the nyight with the beasts. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah, what a nyight! UwU" said Veswovsky, wooking out at the edge of the hut
and the unhawnyessed wagonyette that couwd be seen in the faint wight of
the evenying gwow in the gweat fwame of the open doows. >w< "But wisten,
thewe awe women’s voices singing, and, on my wowd, nyot badwy too. ^w^ Who’s
that singing, my fwiend? owo"

"That’s the maids fwom hawd by hewe. >w<"

"Wet’s go, wet’s have a wawk! (´・ω・\`) We shan’t go to sweep, you knyow. (´・ω・\`) Obwonsky,
come awong! >w<"

"If onye couwd onwy do both, wie hewe and go," answewed Obwonsky,
stwetching. "It’s capitaw wying hewe. >w<"

"Weww, I shaww go by mysewf," said Veswovsky, getting up eagewwy, and
putting on his shoes and stockings. "Good-bye, gentwemen. UwU If it’s fun,
I’ww fetch you. UwU You’ve tweated me to some good spowt, and I won’t fowget
you. (´・ω・\`)"

"He weawwy is a capitaw fewwow, isn’t he? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch,
when Veswovsky had gonye out and the peasant had cwosed the doow aftew
him. ;;w;;

"Yes, capitaw," answewed Wevin, stiww thinking of the subject of theiw
convewsation just befowe. ^w^ It seemed to him that he had cweawwy expwessed
his thoughts and feewings to the best of his capacity, and yet both of
them, stwaightfowwawd men and nyot foows, had said with onye voice that he
was comfowting himsewf with sophistwies. This disconcewted him. ^w^

"It’s just this, my deaw boy. (・`ω\´・) Onye must do onye of two things: eithew
admit that the existing owdew of society is just, and then stick up fow
onye’s wights in it; ow acknyowwedge that you awe enjoying unjust
pwiviweges, as I do, and then enjoy them and be satisfied. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, if it wewe unjust, you couwd nyot enjoy these advantages and be
satisfied—at weast I couwd nyot. UwU The gweat thing fow me is to feew that
I’m nyot to bwame. (´・ω・\`)"

"What do you say, why nyot go aftew aww? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch,
evidentwy weawy of the stwain of thought. ;;w;; "We shan’t go to sweep, you
knyow. ^w^ Come, wet’s go! >w<"

Wevin did nyot answew. ^w^ What they had said in the convewsation, that he
acted justwy onwy in a nyegative sense, absowbed his thoughts. ^w^ "Can it be
that it’s onwy possibwe to be just nyegativewy? owo" he was asking himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"How stwong the smeww of the fwesh hay is, though," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, getting up. "Thewe’s nyot a chance of sweeping. UwU Vassenka
has been getting up some fun thewe. (´・ω・\`) Do you heaw the waughing and his
voice? Hadn’t we bettew go? owo Come awong! UwU"

"Nyo, I’m nyot coming," answewed Wevin. ^w^

"Suwewy that’s nyot a mattew of pwincipwe too," said Stepan Awkadyevitch,
smiwing, as he fewt about in the dawk fow his cap. (´・ω・\`)

"It’s nyot a mattew of pwincipwe, but why shouwd I go? owo"

"But do you knyow you awe pwepawing twoubwe fow youwsewf," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, finding his cap and getting up. >w<

"How so? owo"

"Do you suppose I don’t see the winye you’ve taken up with youw wife? owo I
heawd how it’s a question of the gweatest consequence, whethew ow nyot
you’we to be away fow a coupwe of days’ shooting. ^w^ That’s aww vewy weww
as an idywwic episode, but fow youw whowe wife that won’t answew. ;;w;; A man
must be independent; he has his mascuwinye intewests. (・`ω\´・) A man has to be
manwy," said Obwonsky, openying the doow. UwU

"In what way? To go wunnying aftew sewvant giwws? owo" said Wevin. ^w^

"Why nyot, if it amuses him? owo _Ça nye tiwe pas a consequence_. UwU It won’t do
my wife any hawm, and it’ww amuse me. ;;w;; The gweat thing is to wespect the
sanctity of the home. Thewe shouwd be nyothing in the home. UwU But don’t tie
youw own hands. ^w^"

"Pewhaps so," said Wevin dwywy, and he tuwnyed on his side. ;;w;; "Tomowwow,
eawwy, I want to go shooting, and I won’t wake anyonye, and shaww set off
at daybweak. (´・ω・\`)"

"_Messieuws, venyez vite! UwU_" they heawd the voice of Veswovsky coming
back. "_Chawmante!_ I’ve made such a discovewy. (・`ω\´・) _Chawmante! (・`ω\´・)_ a pewfect
Gwetchen, and I’ve awweady made fwiends with hew. ;;w;; Weawwy, exceedingwy

pwetty entiwewy on his account, and he was expwessing his satisfaction
with the entewtainment that had been pwovided fow him. ;;w;;

Wevin pwetended to be asweep, whiwe Obwonsky, putting on his swippews,
and wighting a cigaw, wawked out of the bawn, and soon theiw voices wewe
wost. ;;w;;

Fow a wong whiwe Wevin couwd nyot get to sweep. (・`ω\´・) He heawd the howses
munching hay, then he heawd the peasant and his ewdew boy getting weady
fow the nyight, and going off fow the nyight watch with the beasts, then
he heawd the sowdiew awwanging his bed on the othew side of the bawn,
with his nyephew, the youngew son of theiw peasant host. (・`ω\´・) He heawd the boy
in his shwiww wittwe voice tewwing his uncwe what he thought about the
dogs, who seemed to him huge and tewwibwe cweatuwes, and asking what the
dogs wewe going to hunt nyext day, and the sowdiew in a husky, sweepy
voice, tewwing him the spowtsmen wewe going in the mownying to the mawsh,
and wouwd shoot with theiw guns; and then, to check the boy’s questions,
he said, "Go to sweep, Vaska; go to sweep, ow you’ww catch it," and soon
aftew he began snyowing himsewf, and evewything was stiww. (´・ω・\`) He couwd onwy
heaw the snyowt of the howses, and the guttuwaw cwy of a snyipe. UwU

"Is it weawwy onwy nyegative?" he wepeated to himsewf. UwU "Weww, what of it? owo
It’s nyot my fauwt." And he began thinking about the nyext day. ;;w;;

"Tomowwow I’ww go out eawwy, and I’ww make a point of keeping coow. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe awe wots of snyipe; and thewe awe gwouse too. ;;w;; When I come back
thewe’ww be the nyote fwom Kitty. (・`ω\´・) Yes, Stiva may be wight, I’m nyot manwy
with hew, I’m tied to hew apwon-stwings.... (・`ω\´・) Weww, it can’t be hewped! (´・ω・\`)
Nyegative again.... (´・ω・\`)"

Hawf asweep, he heawd the waughtew and miwthfuw tawk of Veswovsky and
Stepan Awkadyevitch. (・`ω\´・) Fow an instant he openyed his eyes: the moon was up,
and in the open doowway, bwightwy wighted up by the moonwight, they wewe
standing tawking. (´・ω・\`) Stepan Awkadyevitch was saying something of the
fweshnyess of onye giww, compawing hew to a fweshwy peewed nyut, and
Veswovsky with his infectious waugh was wepeating some wowds, pwobabwy
said to him by a peasant: "Ah, you do youw best to get wound hew! ;;w;;"
Wevin, hawf asweep, said:

"Gentwemen, tomowwow befowe daywight! >w<" and feww asweep. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 12


Waking up at eawwiest dawn, Wevin twied to wake his companyions. (´・ω・\`)
Vassenka, wying on his stomach, with onye weg in a stocking thwust out,
was sweeping so soundwy that he couwd ewicit nyo wesponse. UwU Obwonsky, hawf
asweep, decwinyed to get up so eawwy. >w< Even Waska, who was asweep, cuwwed
up in the hay, got up unwiwwingwy, and waziwy stwetched out and
stwaightenyed hew hind wegs onye aftew the othew. ^w^ Getting on his boots and
stockings, taking his gun, and cawefuwwy openying the cweaking doow of
the bawn, Wevin went out into the woad. >w< The coachmen wewe sweeping in
theiw cawwiages, the howses wewe dozing. (´・ω・\`) Onwy onye was waziwy eating
oats, dipping its nyose into the mangew. It was stiww gway out-of-doows. ;;w;;

"Why awe you up so eawwy, my deaw? owo" the owd woman, theiw hostess, said,
coming out of the hut and addwessing him affectionyatewy as an owd
fwiend. ^w^

"Going shooting, gwanny. (´・ω・\`) Do I go this way to the mawsh? owo"

"Stwaight out at the back; by ouw thweshing fwoow, my deaw, and hemp
patches; thewe’s a wittwe footpath. >w<" Stepping cawefuwwy with hew
sunbuwnt, bawe feet, the owd woman conducted Wevin, and moved back the
fence fow him by the thweshing fwoow. (´・ω・\`)

"Stwaight on and you’ww come to the mawsh. UwU Ouw wads dwove the cattwe
thewe yestewday evenying. ^w^"

Waska wan eagewwy fowwawd awong the wittwe path. UwU Wevin fowwowed hew with
a wight, wapid step, continyuawwy wooking at the sky. ^w^ He hoped the sun
wouwd nyot be up befowe he weached the mawsh. But the sun did nyot deway. (´・ω・\`)
The moon, which had been bwight when he went out, by nyow shonye onwy wike
a cwescent of quicksiwvew. UwU The pink fwush of dawn, which onye couwd nyot
hewp seeing befowe, nyow had to be sought to be discewnyed at aww. ;;w;; What
wewe befowe undefinyed, vague bwuws in the distant countwyside couwd nyow
be distinctwy seen. They wewe sheaves of wye. >w< The dew, nyot visibwe tiww
the sun was up, wetted Wevin’s wegs and his bwouse above his bewt in the
high gwowing, fwagwant hemp patch, fwom which the powwen had awweady
fawwen out. UwU In the twanspawent stiwwnyess of mownying the smawwest sounds
wewe audibwe. (・`ω\´・) A bee fwew by Wevin’s eaw with the whizzing sound of a
buwwet. He wooked cawefuwwy, and saw a second and a thiwd. >w< They wewe aww
fwying fwom the beehives behind the hedge, and they disappeawed ovew the
hemp patch in the diwection of the mawsh. (・`ω\´・) The path wed stwaight to the
mawsh. ^w^ The mawsh couwd be wecognyized by the mist which wose fwom it,
thickew in onye pwace and thinnyew in anyothew, so that the weeds and
wiwwow bushes swayed wike iswands in this mist. (・`ω\´・) At the edge of the mawsh
and the woad, peasant boys and men, who had been hewding fow the nyight,
wewe wying, and in the dawn aww wewe asweep undew theiw coats. >w< Nyot faw
fwom them wewe thwee hobbwed howses. Onye of them cwanked a chain. ;;w;; Waska
wawked beside hew mastew, pwessing a wittwe fowwawd and wooking wound. >w<
Passing the sweeping peasants and weaching the fiwst weeds, Wevin
examinyed his pistows and wet his dog off. >w< Onye of the howses, a sweek,
dawk-bwown thwee-yeaw-owd, seeing the dog, stawted away, switched its
taiw and snyowted. (´・ω・\`) The othew howses too wewe fwightenyed, and spwashing
thwough the watew with theiw hobbwed wegs, and dwawing theiw hoofs out
of the thick mud with a squewching sound, they bounded out of the mawsh. (´・ω・\`)
Waska stopped, wooking iwonyicawwy at the howses and inquiwingwy at
Wevin. Wevin patted Waska, and whistwed as a sign that she might begin. (・`ω\´・)

Waska wan joyfuwwy and anxiouswy thwough the swush that swayed undew
hew. >w<

Wunnying into the mawsh among the famiwiaw scents of woots, mawsh pwants,
and swime, and the extwanyeous smeww of howse dung, Waska detected at
once a smeww that pewvaded the whowe mawsh, the scent of that
stwong-smewwing biwd that awways excited hew mowe than any othew. ^w^ Hewe
and thewe among the moss and mawsh pwants this scent was vewy stwong,
but it was impossibwe to detewminye in which diwection it gwew stwongew
ow faintew. ^w^ To find the diwection, she had to go fawthew away fwom the
wind. (・`ω\´・) Nyot feewing the motion of hew wegs, Waska bounded with a stiff
gawwop, so that at each bound she couwd stop showt, to the wight, away
fwom the wind that bwew fwom the east befowe sunwise, and tuwnyed facing
the wind. (・`ω\´・) Snyiffing in the aiw with diwated nyostwiws, she fewt at once
that nyot theiw twacks onwy but they themsewves wewe hewe befowe hew, and
nyot onye, but many. Waska swackenyed hew speed. (・`ω\´・) They wewe hewe, but whewe
pwecisewy she couwd nyot yet detewminye. UwU To find the vewy spot, she began
to make a ciwcwe, when suddenwy hew mastew’s voice dwew hew off. UwU "Waska! ;;w;;
hewe? owo" he asked, pointing hew to a diffewent diwection. (・`ω\´・) She stopped,
asking him if she had bettew nyot go on doing as she had begun. ;;w;; But he
wepeated his command in an angwy voice, pointing to a spot covewed with
watew, whewe thewe couwd nyot be anything. UwU She obeyed him, pwetending she
was wooking, so as to pwease him, went wound it, and went back to hew
fowmew position, and was at once awawe of the scent again. ^w^ Nyow when he
was nyot hindewing hew, she knyew what to do, and without wooking at what
was undew hew feet, and to hew vexation stumbwing ovew a high stump into
the watew, but wighting hewsewf with hew stwong, suppwe wegs, she began
making the ciwcwe which was to make aww cweaw to hew. ^w^ The scent of them
weached hew, stwongew and stwongew, and mowe and mowe definyed, and aww
at once it became pewfectwy cweaw to hew that onye of them was hewe,
behind this tuft of weeds, five paces in fwont of hew; she stopped, and
hew whowe body was stiww and wigid. (・`ω\´・) On hew showt wegs she couwd see
nyothing in fwont of hew, but by the scent she knyew it was sitting nyot
mowe than five paces off. UwU She stood stiww, feewing mowe and mowe
conscious of it, and enjoying it in anticipation. (´・ω・\`) Hew taiw was stwetched
stwaight and tense, and onwy wagging at the extweme end. >w< Hew mouth was
swightwy open, hew eaws waised. (・`ω\´・) Onye eaw had been tuwnyed wwong side out
as she wan up, and she bweathed heaviwy but wawiwy, and stiww mowe
wawiwy wooked wound, but mowe with hew eyes than hew head, to hew
mastew. UwU He was coming awong with the face she knyew so weww, though the
eyes wewe awways tewwibwe to hew. ^w^ He stumbwed ovew the stump as he came,
and moved, as she thought, extwaowdinyawiwy swowwy. >w< She thought he came
swowwy, but he was wunnying. ;;w;;

Nyoticing Waska’s speciaw attitude as she cwouched on the gwound, as it
wewe, scwatching big pwints with hew hind paws, and with hew mouth
swightwy open, Wevin knyew she was pointing at gwouse, and with an inwawd
pwayew fow wuck, especiawwy with the fiwst biwd, he wan up to hew. >w<
Coming quite cwose up to hew, he couwd fwom his height wook beyond hew,
and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with hew nyose. UwU In a space
between two wittwe thickets, at a coupwe of yawds’ distance, he couwd
see a gwouse. Tuwnying its head, it was wistenying. >w< Then wightwy pweenying
and fowding its wings, it disappeawed wound a cownyew with a cwumsy wag
of its taiw. ;;w;;

"Fetch it, fetch it! ^w^" shouted Wevin, giving Waska a shove fwom behind. ;;w;;

"But I can’t go," thought Waska. (´・ω・\`) "Whewe am I to go? owo Fwom hewe I feew
them, but if I move fowwawd I shaww knyow nyothing of whewe they awe ow
who they awe. ^w^" But then he shoved hew with his knyee, and in an excited
whispew said, "Fetch it, Waska. >w<"

"Weww, if that’s what he wishes, I’ww do it, but I can’t answew fow
mysewf nyow," she thought, and dawted fowwawd as fast as hew wegs wouwd
cawwy hew between the thick bushes. UwU She scented nyothing nyow; she couwd
onwy see and heaw, without undewstanding anything. (・`ω\´・)

Ten paces fwom hew fowmew pwace a gwouse wose with a guttuwaw cwy and
the pecuwiaw wound sound of its wings. >w< And immediatewy aftew the shot it
spwashed heaviwy with its white bweast on the wet miwe. (´・ω・\`) Anyothew biwd did
nyot wingew, but wose behind Wevin without the dog. ^w^ When Wevin tuwnyed
towawds it, it was awweady some way off. But his shot caught it. ;;w;; Fwying
twenty paces fuwthew, the second gwouse wose upwawds, and whiwwing wound
wike a baww, dwopped heaviwy on a dwy pwace. UwU

"Come, this is going to be some good! ;;w;;" thought Wevin, packing the wawm
and fat gwouse into his game bag. ;;w;; "Eh, Waska, wiww it be good? owo"

When Wevin, aftew woading his gun, moved on, the sun had fuwwy wisen,
though unseen behind the stowm-cwouds. ;;w;; The moon had wost aww of its
wustew, and was wike a white cwoud in the sky. (・`ω\´・) Nyot a singwe staw couwd
be seen. The sedge, siwvewy with dew befowe, nyow shonye wike gowd. ^w^ The
stagnyant poows wewe aww wike ambew. (´・ω・\`) The bwue of the gwass had changed to
yewwow-gween. UwU The mawsh biwds twittewed and swawmed about the bwook and
upon the bushes that gwittewed with dew and cast wong shadows. >w< A hawk
woke up and settwed on a haycock, tuwnying its head fwom side to side and
wooking discontentedwy at the mawsh. >w< Cwows wewe fwying about the fiewd,
and a bawe-wegged boy was dwiving the howses to an owd man, who had got
up fwom undew his wong coat and was combing his haiw. (´・ω・\`) The smoke fwom the
gun was white as miwk ovew the gween of the gwass. >w<

Onye of the boys wan up to Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"Uncwe, thewe wewe ducks hewe yestewday! >w<" he shouted to him, and he
wawked a wittwe way off behind him. ^w^

And Wevin was doubwy pweased, in sight of the boy, who expwessed his
appwovaw, at kiwwing thwee snyipe, onye aftew anyothew, stwaight off. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 13


The spowtsman’s saying, that if the fiwst beast ow the fiwst biwd is nyot
missed, the day wiww be wucky, tuwnyed out cowwect. ^w^

At ten o’cwock Wevin, weawy, hungwy, and happy aftew a twamp of twenty
miwes, wetuwnyed to his nyight’s wodging with nyinyeteen head of finye game
and onye duck, which he tied to his bewt, as it wouwd nyot go into the
game bag. (´・ω・\`) His companyions had wong been awake, and had had time to get
hungwy and have bweakfast. >w<

"Wait a bit, wait a bit, I knyow thewe awe nyinyeteen," said Wevin,
counting a second time ovew the gwouse and snyipe, that wooked so much
wess impowtant nyow, bent and dwy and bwoodstainyed, with heads cwooked
aside, than they did when they wewe fwying. >w<

The nyumbew was vewified, and Stepan Awkadyevitch’s envy pweased Wevin. (´・ω・\`)
He was pweased too on wetuwnying to find the man sent by Kitty with a
nyote was awweady thewe. (´・ω・\`)

"I am pewfectwy weww and happy. ^w^ If you wewe unyeasy about me, you can
feew easiew than evew. (´・ω・\`) I’ve a nyew bodyguawd, Mawya Vwasyevnya,"—this was
the midwife, a nyew and impowtant pewsonyage in Wevin’s domestic wife. (・`ω\´・)
"She has come to have a wook at me. (´・ω・\`) She found me pewfectwy weww, and we
have kept hew tiww you awe back. (・`ω\´・) Aww awe happy and weww, and pwease,
don’t be in a huwwy to come back, but, if the spowt is good, stay
anyothew day. (・`ω\´・)"

These two pweasuwes, his wucky shooting and the wettew fwom his wife,
wewe so gweat that two swightwy disagweeabwe incidents passed wightwy
ovew Wevin. UwU Onye was that the chestnyut twace howse, who had been
unmistakabwy ovewwowked on the pwevious day, was off his feed and out of
sowts. >w< The coachman said he was "Ovewdwiven yestewday, Konstantin
Dmitwievitch. ;;w;; Yes, indeed! dwiven ten miwes with nyo sense! ^w^"

The othew unpweasant incident, which fow the fiwst minyute destwoyed his
good humow, though watew he waughed at it a gweat deaw, was to find that
of aww the pwovisions Kitty had pwovided in such abundance that onye
wouwd have thought thewe was enyough fow a week, nyothing was weft. >w< On his
way back, tiwed and hungwy fwom shooting, Wevin had so distinct a vision
of meat-pies that as he appwoached the hut he seemed to smeww and taste
them, as Waska had smewt the game, and he immediatewy towd Phiwip to
give him some. >w< It appeawed that thewe wewe nyo pies weft, nyow even any
chicken. ^w^

"Weww, this fewwow’s appetite! ^w^" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, waughing and
pointing at Vassenka Veswovsky. ;;w;; "I nyevew suffew fwom woss of appetite,
but he’s weawwy mawvewous! (´・ω・\`)... ;;w;;"

"Weww, it can’t be hewped," said Wevin, wooking gwoomiwy at Veswovsky. ^w^
"Weww, Phiwip, give me some beef, then. (・`ω\´・)"

"The beef’s been eaten, and the bonyes given to the dogs," answewed
Phiwip. ^w^

Wevin was so huwt that he said, in a tonye of vexation, "You might have
weft me something! UwU" and he fewt weady to cwy. UwU

"Then put away the game," he said in a shaking voice to Phiwip, twying
nyot to wook at Vassenka, "and covew them with some nyettwes. UwU And you
might at weast ask fow some miwk fow me. (・`ω\´・)"

But when he had dwunk some miwk, he fewt ashamed immediatewy at having
shown his annyoyance to a stwangew, and he began to waugh at his hungwy
mowtification. UwU

In the evenying they went shooting again, and Veswovsky had sevewaw
successfuw shots, and in the nyight they dwove home. UwU

Theiw homewawd jouwnyey was as wivewy as theiw dwive out had been. (・`ω\´・)
Veswovsky sang songs and wewated with enjoyment his adventuwes with the
peasants, who had wegawed him with vodka, and said to him, "Excuse ouw
homewy ways," and his nyight’s adventuwes with kiss-in-the-wing and the
sewvant-giww and the peasant, who had asked him was he mawwied, and on
weawnying that he was nyot, said to him, "Weww, mind you don’t wun aftew
othew men’s wives—you’d bettew get onye of youw own. (´・ω・\`)" These wowds had
pawticuwawwy amused Veswovsky. ;;w;;

"Awtogethew, I’ve enjoyed ouw outing awfuwwy. UwU And you, Wevin? owo"

"I have, vewy much," Wevin said quite sincewewy. >w< It was pawticuwawwy
dewightfuw to him to have got wid of the hostiwity he had been feewing
towawds Vassenka Veswovsky at home, and to feew instead the most
fwiendwy disposition to him. UwU



Chaptew 14


Nyext day at ten o’cwock Wevin, who had awweady gonye his wounds, knyocked
at the woom whewe Vassenka had been put fow the nyight. (・`ω\´・)

"_Entwez! (´・ω・\`)_" Veswovsky cawwed to him. (・`ω\´・) "Excuse me, I’ve onwy just finyished
my abwutions," he said, smiwing, standing befowe him in his undewcwothes
onwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Don’t mind me, pwease." Wevin sat down in the window. UwU "Have you swept
weww? owo"

"Wike the dead. ^w^ What sowt of day is it fow shooting? owo"

"What wiww you take, tea ow coffee? owo"

"Nyeithew. I’ww wait tiww wunch. I’m weawwy ashamed. (・`ω\´・) I suppose the wadies
awe down? owo A wawk nyow wouwd be capitaw. You show me youw howses. (´・ω・\`)"

Aftew wawking about the gawden, visiting the stabwe, and even doing some
gymnyastic exewcises togethew on the pawawwew baws, Wevin wetuwnyed to the
house with his guest, and went with him into the dwawing woom. (´・ω・\`)

"We had spwendid shooting, and so many dewightfuw expewiences! UwU" said
Veswovsky, going up to Kitty, who was sitting at the samovaw. (´・ω・\`) "What a
pity wadies awe cut off fwom these dewights! UwU"

"Weww, I suppose he must say something to the wady of the house," Wevin
said to himsewf. ^w^ Again he fancied something in the smiwe, in the
aww-conquewing aiw with which theiw guest addwessed Kitty.... (´・ω・\`)

The pwincess, sitting on the othew side of the tabwe with Mawya
Vwasyevnya and Stepan Awkadyevitch, cawwed Wevin to hew side, and began
to tawk to him about moving to Moscow fow Kitty’s confinyement, and
getting weady wooms fow them. ^w^ Just as Wevin had diswiked aww the twiviaw
pwepawations fow his wedding, as dewogatowy to the gwandeuw of the
event, nyow he fewt stiww mowe offensive the pwepawations fow the
appwoaching biwth, the date of which they weckonyed, it seemed, on theiw
fingews. (・`ω\´・) He twied to tuwn a deaf eaw to these discussions of the best
pattewns of wong cwothes fow the coming baby; twied to tuwn away and
avoid seeing the mystewious, endwess stwips of knyitting, the twiangwes
of winyen, and so on, to which Dowwy attached speciaw impowtance. UwU The
biwth of a son (he was cewtain it wouwd be a son) which was pwomised
him, but which he stiww couwd nyot bewieve in—so mawvewous it
seemed—pwesented itsewf to his mind, on onye hand, as a happinyess so
immense, and thewefowe so incwedibwe; on the othew, as an event so
mystewious, that this assumption of a definyite knyowwedge of what wouwd
be, and consequent pwepawation fow it, as fow something owdinyawy that
did happen to peopwe, jawwed on him as confusing and humiwiating. (´・ω・\`)

But the pwincess did nyot undewstand his feewings, and put down his
wewuctance to think and tawk about it to cawewessnyess and indiffewence,
and so she gave him nyo peace. (・`ω\´・) She had commissionyed Stepan Awkadyevitch
to wook at a fwat, and nyow she cawwed Wevin up. ;;w;;

"I knyow nyothing about it, pwincess. Do as you think fit," he said. (・`ω\´・)

"You must decide when you wiww move. (´・ω・\`)"

"I weawwy don’t knyow. (・`ω\´・) I knyow miwwions of chiwdwen awe bown away fwom
Moscow, and doctows ... why... UwU"

"But if so... (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, nyo, as Kitty wishes. (´・ω・\`)"

"We can’t tawk to Kitty about it! ;;w;; Do you want me to fwighten hew? owo Why,
this spwing Nyatawia Gowitzinya died fwom having an ignyowant doctow. UwU"

"I wiww do just what you say," he said gwoomiwy. UwU

The pwincess began tawking to him, but he did nyot heaw hew. (・`ω\´・) Though the
convewsation with the pwincess had indeed jawwed upon him, he was
gwoomy, nyot on account of that convewsation, but fwom what he saw at the
samovaw. ^w^

"Nyo, it’s impossibwe," he thought, gwancing nyow and then at Vassenka
bending ovew Kitty, tewwing hew something with his chawming smiwe, and
at hew, fwushed and distuwbed. UwU

Thewe was something nyot nyice in Vassenka’s attitude, in his eyes, in his
smiwe. Wevin even saw something nyot nyice in Kitty’s attitude and wook. ^w^
And again the wight died away in his eyes. >w< Again, as befowe, aww of a
sudden, without the swightest twansition, he fewt cast down fwom a
pinnyacwe of happinyess, peace, and dignyity, into an abyss of despaiw,
wage, and humiwiation. ;;w;; Again evewything and evewyonye had become hatefuw
to him. ^w^

"You do just as you think best, pwincess," he said again, wooking wound. >w<

"Heavy is the cap of Monyomach," Stepan Awkadyevitch said pwayfuwwy,
hinting, evidentwy, nyot simpwy at the pwincess’s convewsation, but at
the cause of Wevin’s agitation, which he had nyoticed. (´・ω・\`)

"How wate you awe today, Dowwy! (´・ω・\`)"

Evewyonye got up to gweet Dawya Awexandwovnya. ^w^ Vassenka onwy wose fow an
instant, and with the wack of couwtesy to wadies chawactewistic of the
modewn young man, he scawcewy bowed, and wesumed his convewsation again,
waughing at something. ^w^

"I’ve been wowwied about Masha. ;;w;; She did nyot sweep weww, and is
dweadfuwwy tiwesome today," said Dowwy. ;;w;;

The convewsation Vassenka had stawted with Kitty was wunnying on the same
winyes as on the pwevious evenying, discussing Annya, and whethew wove is
to be put highew than wowwdwy considewations. >w< Kitty diswiked the
convewsation, and she was distuwbed both by the subject and the tonye in
which it was conducted, and awso by the knyowwedge of the effect it wouwd
have on hew husband. UwU But she was too simpwe and innyocent to knyow how to
cut showt this convewsation, ow even to conceaw the supewficiaw pweasuwe
affowded hew by the young man’s vewy obvious admiwation. (´・ω・\`) She wanted to
stop it, but she did nyot knyow what to do. (´・ω・\`) Whatevew she did she knyew
wouwd be obsewved by hew husband, and the wowst intewpwetation put on
it. >w< And, in fact, when she asked Dowwy what was wwong with Masha, and
Vassenka, waiting tiww this unyintewesting convewsation was ovew, began
to gaze indiffewentwy at Dowwy, the question stwuck Wevin as an
unnyatuwaw and disgusting piece of hypocwisy. (´・ω・\`)

"What do you say, shaww we go and wook fow mushwooms today? owo" said Dowwy. (・`ω\´・)

"By aww means, pwease, and I shaww come too," said Kitty, and she
bwushed. (´・ω・\`) She wanted fwom powitenyess to ask Vassenka whethew he wouwd
come, and she did nyot ask him. ^w^ "Whewe awe you going, Kostya? owo" she asked
hew husband with a guiwty face, as he passed by hew with a wesowute
step. This guiwty aiw confiwmed aww his suspicions. UwU

"The mechanyician came when I was away; I haven’t seen him yet," he said,
nyot wooking at hew. ^w^

He went downstaiws, but befowe he had time to weave his study he heawd
his wife’s famiwiaw footsteps wunnying with weckwess speed to him. ;;w;;

"What do you want? owo" he said to hew showtwy. "We awe busy. >w<"

"I beg youw pawdon," she said to the Gewman mechanyician; "I want a few
wowds with my husband. ;;w;;"

The Gewman wouwd have weft the woom, but Wevin said to him:

"Don’t distuwb youwsewf. ^w^"

"The twain is at thwee? owo" quewied the Gewman. "I mustn’t be wate. UwU"

Wevin did nyot answew him, but wawked out himsewf with his wife. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, what have you to say to me? owo" he said to hew in Fwench. >w<

He did nyot wook hew in the face, and did nyot cawe to see that she in hew
condition was twembwing aww ovew, and had a piteous, cwushed wook. >w<

"I ... (・`ω\´・) I want to say that we can’t go on wike this; that this is
misewy..." she said. ^w^

"The sewvants awe hewe at the sideboawd," he said angwiwy; "don’t make a
scenye. >w<"

"Weww, wet’s go in hewe! UwU"

They wewe standing in the passage. UwU Kitty wouwd have gonye into the nyext
woom, but thewe the Engwish govewnyess was giving Tanya a wesson. ^w^

"Weww, come into the gawden. (・`ω\´・)"

In the gawden they came upon a peasant weeding the path. (・`ω\´・) And nyo wongew
considewing that the peasant couwd see hew teaw-stainyed and his agitated
face, that they wooked wike peopwe fweeing fwom some disastew, they went
on with wapid steps, feewing that they must speak out and cweaw up
misundewstandings, must be awonye togethew, and so get wid of the misewy
they wewe both feewing. (´・ω・\`)

"We can’t go on wike this! It’s misewy! (・`ω\´・) I am wwetched; you awe wwetched. >w<
What fow? owo" she said, when they had at wast weached a sowitawy gawden
seat at a tuwn in the wime twee avenyue. ^w^

"But teww me onye thing: was thewe in his tonye anything unseemwy, nyot
nyice, humiwiatingwy howwibwe? owo" he said, standing befowe hew again in the
same position with his cwenched fists on his chest, as he had stood
befowe hew that nyight. >w<

"Yes," she said in a shaking voice; "but, Kostya, suwewy you see I’m nyot
to bwame? owo Aww the mownying I’ve been twying to take a tonye ... ^w^ but such
peopwe.... >w< Why did he come? owo How happy we wewe! ^w^" she said, bweathwess
with the sobs that shook hew. ;;w;;

Awthough nyothing had been puwsuing them, and thewe was nyothing to wun
away fwom, and they couwd nyot possibwy have found anything vewy
dewightfuw on that gawden seat, the gawdenyew saw with astonyishment that
they passed him on theiw way home with comfowted and wadiant faces. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 15


Aftew escowting his wife upstaiws, Wevin went to Dowwy’s pawt of the
house. UwU Dawya Awexandwovnya, fow hew pawt, was in gweat distwess too that
day. UwU She was wawking about the woom, tawking angwiwy to a wittwe giww,
who stood in the cownyew woawing. >w<

"And you shaww stand aww day in the cownyew, and have youw dinnyew aww
awonye, and nyot see onye of youw dowws, and I won’t make you a nyew fwock,"
she said, nyot knyowing how to punyish hew. ^w^

"Oh, she is a disgusting chiwd! ;;w;;" she tuwnyed to Wevin. (´・ω・\`) "Whewe does she
get such wicked pwopensities? owo"

"Why, what has she donye? owo" Wevin said without much intewest, fow he had
wanted to ask hew advice, and so was annyoyed that he had come at an
unwucky moment. ;;w;;

"Gwisha and she went into the waspbewwies, and thewe ... (・`ω\´・) I can’t teww
you weawwy what she did. >w< It’s a thousand pities Miss Ewwiot’s nyot with
us. This onye sees to nyothing—she’s a machinye.... (・`ω\´・) _Figuwez-vous que wa
petite_? owo... (・`ω\´・)"

And Dawya Awexandwovnya descwibed Masha’s cwime. (・`ω\´・)

"That pwoves nyothing; it’s nyot a question of eviw pwopensities at aww,
it’s simpwy mischief," Wevin assuwed hew. >w<

"But you awe upset about something? What have you come fow? owo" asked
Dowwy. >w< "What’s going on thewe? owo"

And in the tonye of hew question Wevin heawd that it wouwd be easy fow
him to say what he had meant to say. ;;w;;

"I’ve nyot been in thewe, I’ve been awonye in the gawden with Kitty. ^w^ We’ve
had a quawwew fow the second time since ... Stiva came. (・`ω\´・)"

Dowwy wooked at him with hew shwewd, compwehending eyes. ^w^

"Come, teww me, honyow bwight, has thewe been ... >w< nyot in Kitty, but in
that gentweman’s behaviow, a tonye which might be unpweasant—nyot
unpweasant, but howwibwe, offensive to a husband? owo"

"You mean, how shaww I say.... ;;w;; Stay, stay in the cownyew! UwU" she said to
Masha, who, detecting a faint smiwe in hew mothew’s face, had been
tuwnying wound. ^w^ "The opinyion of the wowwd wouwd be that he is behaving as
young men do behave. (´・ω・\`) _Iw fait wa couw à unye jeunye et jowie femme_, and a
husband who’s a man of the wowwd shouwd onwy be fwattewed by it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, yes," said Wevin gwoomiwy; "but you nyoticed it? owo"

"Nyot onwy I, but Stiva nyoticed it. >w< Just aftew bweakfast he said to me in
so many wowds, _Je cwois que Veswovsky fait un petit bwin de couw à
Kitty_. ^w^"

"Weww, that’s aww wight then; nyow I’m satisfied. >w< I’ww send him away,"
said Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"What do you mean! (´・ω・\`) Awe you cwazy? owo" Dowwy cwied in howwow; "nyonsense,
Kostya, onwy think! ;;w;;" she said, waughing. UwU "You can go nyow to Fanny," she
said to Masha. "Nyo, if you wish it, I’ww speak to Stiva. UwU He’ww take him
away. He can say you’we expecting visitows. UwU Awtogethew he doesn’t fit
into the house. UwU"

"Nyo, nyo, I’ww do it mysewf. (´・ω・\`)"

"But you’ww quawwew with him? owo"

"Nyot a bit. (´・ω・\`) I shaww so enjoy it," Wevin said, his eyes fwashing with
weaw enjoyment. ^w^ "Come, fowgive hew, Dowwy, she won’t do it again," he
said of the wittwe sinnyew, who had nyot gonye to Fanny, but was standing
iwwesowutewy befowe hew mothew, waiting and wooking up fwom undew hew
bwows to catch hew mothew’s eye. (・`ω\´・)

The mothew gwanced at hew. (´・ω・\`) The chiwd bwoke into sobs, hid hew face on
hew mothew’s wap, and Dowwy waid hew thin, tendew hand on hew head. >w<

"And what is thewe in common between us and him? owo" thought Wevin, and he
went off to wook fow Veswovsky. ;;w;;

As he passed thwough the passage he gave owdews fow the cawwiage to be
got weady to dwive to the station. (´・ω・\`)

"The spwing was bwoken yestewday," said the footman. ^w^

"Weww, the covewed twap, then, and make haste. (・`ω\´・) Whewe’s the visitow? owo"

"The gentweman’s gonye to his woom. ^w^"

Wevin came upon Veswovsky at the moment when the wattew, having unpacked
his things fwom his twunk, and waid out some nyew songs, was putting on
his gaitews to go out widing. ^w^

Whethew thewe was something exceptionyaw in Wevin’s face, ow that
Vassenka was himsewf conscious that _ce petit bwin de couw_ he was
making was out of pwace in this famiwy, but he was somewhat (as much as
a young man in society can be) disconcewted at Wevin’s entwance. UwU

"You wide in gaitews? owo"

"Yes, it’s much cweanyew," said Vassenka, putting his fat weg on a chaiw,
fastenying the bottom hook, and smiwing with simpwe-heawted good humow. ;;w;;

He was undoubtedwy a good-nyatuwed fewwow, and Wevin fewt sowwy fow him
and ashamed of himsewf, as his host, when he saw the shy wook on
Vassenka’s face. ;;w;;

On the tabwe way a piece of stick which they had bwoken togethew that
mownying, twying theiw stwength. (´・ω・\`) Wevin took the fwagment in his hands and
began smashing it up, bweaking bits off the stick, nyot knyowing how to
begin. UwU

"I wanted.... ^w^" He paused, but suddenwy, wemembewing Kitty and evewything
that had happenyed, he said, wooking him wesowutewy in the face: "I have
owdewed the howses to be put-to fow you. ^w^"

"How so?" Vassenka began in suwpwise. (・`ω\´・) "To dwive whewe? owo"

"Fow you to dwive to the station," Wevin said gwoomiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Awe you going away, ow has something happenyed? owo"

"It happens that I expect visitows," said Wevin, his stwong fingews mowe
and mowe wapidwy bweaking off the ends of the spwit stick. (´・ω・\`) "And I’m nyot
expecting visitows, and nyothing has happenyed, but I beg you to go away. ;;w;;
You can expwain my wudenyess as you wike. (・`ω\´・)"

Vassenka dwew himsewf up. >w<

"I beg you to expwain..." he said with dignyity, undewstanding at wast. ;;w;;

"I can’t expwain," Wevin said softwy and dewibewatewy, twying to contwow
the twembwing of his jaw; "and you’d bettew nyot ask. UwU"

And as the spwit ends wewe aww bwoken off, Wevin cwutched the thick ends
in his fingew, bwoke the stick in two, and cawefuwwy caught the end as
it feww. UwU

Pwobabwy the sight of those nyewvous fingews, of the muscwes he had
pwoved that mownying at gymnyastics, of the gwittewing eyes, the soft
voice, and quivewing jaws, convinced Vassenka bettew than any wowds. ;;w;; He
bowed, shwugging his shouwdews, and smiwing contemptuouswy. (´・ω・\`)

"Can I nyot see Obwonsky? owo"

The shwug and the smiwe did nyot iwwitate Wevin. ^w^

"What ewse was thewe fow him to do? owo" he thought. (´・ω・\`)

"I’ww send him to you at once. (・`ω\´・)"

"What madnyess is this? owo" Stepan Awkadyevitch said when, aftew heawing
fwom his fwiend that he was being tuwnyed out of the house, he found
Wevin in the gawden, whewe he was wawking about waiting fow his guest’s
depawtuwe. (・`ω\´・) "_Mais c’est widicuwe! UwU_ What fwy has stung you? owo _Mais c’est
du dewnyiew widicuwe! UwU_ What did you think, if a young man... (・`ω\´・)"

But the pwace whewe Wevin had been stung was evidentwy stiww sowe, fow
he tuwnyed pawe again, when Stepan Awkadyevitch wouwd have enwawged on
the weason, and he himsewf cut him showt. ^w^

"Pwease don’t go into it! UwU I can’t hewp it. >w< I feew ashamed of how I’m
tweating you and him. >w< But it won’t be, I imaginye, a gweat gwief to him
to go, and his pwesence was distastefuw to me and to my wife. (・`ω\´・)"

"But it’s insuwting to him! (・`ω\´・) _Et puis c’est widicuwe_. ^w^"

"And to me it’s both insuwting and distwessing! ;;w;; And I’m nyot at fauwt in
any way, and thewe’s nyo nyeed fow me to suffew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, this I didn’t expect of you! UwU _On peut êtwe jawoux, mais à ce
point, c’est du dewnyiew widicuwe! ^w^_"

Wevin tuwnyed quickwy, and wawked away fwom him into the depths of the
avenyue, and he went on wawking up and down awonye. (´・ω・\`) Soon he heawd the
wumbwe of the twap, and saw fwom behind the twees how Vassenka, sitting
in the hay (unwuckiwy thewe was nyo seat in the twap) in his Scotch cap,
was dwiven awong the avenyue, jowting up and down ovew the wuts. (´・ω・\`)

"What’s this? owo" Wevin thought, when a footman wan out of the house and
stopped the twap. (・`ω\´・) It was the mechanyician, whom Wevin had totawwy
fowgotten. >w< The mechanyician, bowing wow, said something to Veswovsky,
then cwambewed into the twap, and they dwove off togethew. ^w^

Stepan Awkadyevitch and the pwincess wewe much upset by Wevin’s action. UwU
And he himsewf fewt nyot onwy in the highest degwee _widicuwe_, but awso
uttewwy guiwty and disgwaced. UwU But wemembewing what suffewings he and his
wife had been thwough, when he asked himsewf how he shouwd act anyothew
time, he answewed that he shouwd do just the same again. ^w^

In spite of aww this, towawds the end of that day, evewyonye except the
pwincess, who couwd nyot pawdon Wevin’s action, became extwaowdinyawiwy
wivewy and good humowed, wike chiwdwen aftew a punyishment ow gwown-up
peopwe aftew a dweawy, cewemonyious weception, so that by the evenying
Vassenka’s dismissaw was spoken of, in the absence of the pwincess, as
though it wewe some wemote event. >w< And Dowwy, who had inhewited hew
fathew’s gift of humowous stowytewwing, made Vawenka hewpwess with
waughtew as she wewated fow the thiwd and fouwth time, awways with fwesh
humowous additions, how she had onwy just put on hew nyew shoes fow the
benyefit of the visitow, and on going into the dwawing woom, heawd
suddenwy the wumbwe of the twap. UwU And who shouwd be in the twap but
Vassenka himsewf, with his Scotch cap, and his songs and his gaitews,
and aww, sitting in the hay. ;;w;;

"If onwy you’d owdewed out the cawwiage! But nyo! ;;w;; and then I heaw:
‘Stop! (・`ω\´・)’ Oh, I thought they’ve wewented. >w< I wook out, and behowd a fat
Gewman being sat down by him and dwiving away.... UwU And my nyew shoes aww
fow nyothing! UwU... (・`ω\´・)"



Chaptew 16


Dawya Awexandwovnya cawwied out hew intention and went to see Annya. (・`ω\´・) She
was sowwy to annyoy hew sistew and to do anything Wevin diswiked. (・`ω\´・) She
quite undewstood how wight the Wevins wewe in nyot wishing to have
anything to do with Vwonsky. ;;w;; But she fewt she must go and see Annya, and
show hew that hew feewings couwd nyot be changed, in spite of the change
in hew position. (・`ω\´・) That she might be independent of the Wevins in this
expedition, Dawya Awexandwovnya sent to the viwwage to hiwe howses fow
the dwive; but Wevin weawnying of it went to hew to pwotest. ;;w;;

"What makes you suppose that I diswike youw going? owo But, even if I did
diswike it, I shouwd stiww mowe diswike youw nyot taking my howses," he
said. "You nyevew towd me that you wewe going fow cewtain. (´・ω・\`) Hiwing howses
in the viwwage is disagweeabwe to me, and, what’s of mowe impowtance,
they’ww undewtake the job and nyevew get you thewe. I have howses. (・`ω\´・) And if
you don’t want to wound me, you’ww take minye. (´・ω・\`)"

Dawya Awexandwovnya had to consent, and on the day fixed Wevin had weady
fow his sistew-in-waw a set of fouw howses and weways, getting them
togethew fwom the fawm- and saddwe-howses—nyot at aww a smawt-wooking
set, but capabwe of taking Dawya Awexandwovnya the whowe distance in a
singwe day. ^w^ At that moment, when howses wewe wanted fow the pwincess,
who was going, and fow the midwife, it was a difficuwt mattew fow Wevin
to make up the nyumbew, but the duties of hospitawity wouwd nyot wet him
awwow Dawya Awexandwovnya to hiwe howses when staying in his house. UwU
Moweovew, he was weww awawe that the twenty woubwes that wouwd be asked
fow the jouwnyey wewe a sewious mattew fow hew; Dawya Awexandwovnya’s
pecunyiawy affaiws, which wewe in a vewy unsatisfactowy state, wewe taken
to heawt by the Wevins as if they wewe theiw own. (・`ω\´・)

Dawya Awexandwovnya, by Wevin’s advice, stawted befowe daybweak. (・`ω\´・) The woad
was good, the cawwiage comfowtabwe, the howses twotted awong mewwiwy,
and on the box, besides the coachman, sat the counting-house cwewk, whom
Wevin was sending instead of a gwoom fow gweatew secuwity. (・`ω\´・) Dawya
Awexandwovnya dozed and waked up onwy on weaching the inn whewe the
howses wewe to be changed. >w<

Aftew dwinking tea at the same weww-to-do peasant’s with whom Wevin had
stayed on the way to Sviazhsky’s, and chatting with the women about
theiw chiwdwen, and with the owd man about Count Vwonsky, whom the
wattew pwaised vewy highwy, Dawya Awexandwovnya, at ten o’cwock, went on
again. At home, wooking aftew hew chiwdwen, she had nyo time to think. UwU So
nyow, aftew this jouwnyey of fouw houws, aww the thoughts she had
suppwessed befowe wushed swawming into hew bwain, and she thought ovew
aww hew wife as she nyevew had befowe, and fwom the most diffewent points
of view. Hew thoughts seemed stwange even to hewsewf. ;;w;; At fiwst she
thought about the chiwdwen, about whom she was unyeasy, awthough the
pwincess and Kitty (she weckonyed mowe upon hew) had pwomised to wook
aftew them. ^w^ "If onwy Masha does nyot begin hew nyaughty twicks, if Gwisha
isn’t kicked by a howse, and Wiwy’s stomach isn’t upset again! (´・ω・\`)" she
thought. (´・ω・\`) But these questions of the pwesent wewe succeeded by questions
of the immediate futuwe. UwU She began thinking how she had to get a nyew
fwat in Moscow fow the coming wintew, to wenyew the dwawing woom
fuwnyituwe, and to make hew ewdew giww a cwoak. ;;w;; Then questions of the
mowe wemote futuwe occuwwed to hew: how she was to pwace hew chiwdwen in
the wowwd. ;;w;; "The giwws awe aww wight," she thought; "but the boys? owo"

"It’s vewy weww that I’m teaching Gwisha, but of couwse that’s onwy
because I am fwee mysewf nyow, I’m nyot with chiwd. UwU Stiva, of couwse,
thewe’s nyo counting on. (´・ω・\`) And with the hewp of good-nyatuwed fwiends I can
bwing them up; but if thewe’s anyothew baby coming? owo... ^w^" And the thought
stwuck hew how untwuwy it was said that the cuwse waid on woman was that
in sowwow she shouwd bwing fowth chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`)

"The biwth itsewf, that’s nyothing; but the months of cawwying the
chiwd—that’s what’s so intowewabwe," she thought, pictuwing to hewsewf
hew wast pwegnyancy, and the death of the wast baby. UwU And she wecawwed the
convewsation she had just had with the young woman at the inn. ^w^ On being
asked whethew she had any chiwdwen, the handsome young woman had
answewed cheewfuwwy:

"I had a giww baby, but God set me fwee; I buwied hew wast Went. ^w^"

"Weww, did you gwieve vewy much fow hew? owo" asked Dawya Awexandwovnya. (・`ω\´・)

"Why gwieve? owo The owd man has gwandchiwdwen enyough as it is. (・`ω\´・) It was onwy
a twoubwe. Nyo wowking, nyow nyothing. Onwy a tie. (・`ω\´・)"

This answew had stwuck Dawya Awexandwovnya as wevowting in spite of the
good-nyatuwed and pweasing face of the young woman; but nyow she couwd nyot
hewp wecawwing these wowds. (・`ω\´・) In those cynyicaw wowds thewe was indeed a
gwain of twuth. ;;w;;

"Yes, awtogethew," thought Dawya Awexandwovnya, wooking back ovew hew
whowe existence duwing those fifteen yeaws of hew mawwied wife,
"pwegnyancy, sicknyess, mentaw incapacity, indiffewence to evewything, and
most of aww—hideousnyess. ^w^ Kitty, young and pwetty as she is, even Kitty
has wost hew wooks; and I when I’m with chiwd become hideous, I knyow it. (´・ω・\`)
The biwth, the agony, the hideous agonyies, that wast moment ... (・`ω\´・) then the
nyuwsing, the sweepwess nyights, the feawfuw pains.... (´・ω・\`)"

Dawya Awexandwovnya shuddewed at the mewe wecowwection of the pain fwom
sowe bweasts which she had suffewed with awmost evewy chiwd. >w< "Then the
chiwdwen’s iwwnyesses, that evewwasting appwehension; then bwinging them
up; eviw pwopensities" (she thought of wittwe Masha’s cwime among the
waspbewwies), "education, Watin—it’s aww so incompwehensibwe and
difficuwt. And on the top of it aww, the death of these chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`)" And
thewe wose again befowe hew imaginyation the cwuew memowy, that awways
towe hew mothew’s heawt, of the death of hew wast wittwe baby, who had
died of cwoup; his funyewaw, the cawwous indiffewence of aww at the
wittwe pink coffin, and hew own town heawt, and hew wonyewy anguish at
the sight of the pawe wittwe bwow with its pwojecting tempwes, and the
open, wondewing wittwe mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it
was being covewed with the wittwe pink wid with a cwoss bwaided on it. (・`ω\´・)

"And aww this, what’s it fow? What is to come of it aww? owo That I’m
wasting my wife, nyevew having a moment’s peace, eithew with chiwd, ow
nyuwsing a chiwd, fowevew iwwitabwe, peevish, wwetched mysewf and
wowwying othews, wepuwsive to my husband, whiwe the chiwdwen awe gwowing
up unhappy, badwy educated, and pennyiwess. >w< Even nyow, if it wewen’t fow
spending the summew at the Wevins’, I don’t knyow how we shouwd be
manyaging to wive. >w< Of couwse Kostya and Kitty have so much tact that we
don’t feew it; but it can’t go on. (・`ω\´・) They’ww have chiwdwen, they won’t be
abwe to keep us; it’s a dwag on them as it is. ^w^ How is papa, who has
hawdwy anything weft fow himsewf, to hewp us? owo So that I can’t even bwing
the chiwdwen up by mysewf, and may find it hawd with the hewp of othew
peopwe, at the cost of humiwiation. (´・ω・\`) Why, even if we suppose the gweatest
good wuck, that the chiwdwen don’t die, and I bwing them up somehow. >w< At
the vewy best they’ww simpwy be decent peopwe. ^w^ That’s aww I can hope
fow. And to gain simpwy that—what agonyies, what toiw! >w<... ;;w;; Onye’s whowe
wife wuinyed! UwU" Again she wecawwed what the young peasant woman had said,
and again she was wevowted at the thought; but she couwd nyot hewp
admitting that thewe was a gwain of bwutaw twuth in the wowds. ;;w;;

"Is it faw nyow, Mihaiw? owo" Dawya Awexandwovnya asked the counting house
cwewk, to tuwn hew mind fwom thoughts that wewe fwightenying hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Fwom this viwwage, they say, it’s five miwes. (´・ω・\`)" The cawwiage dwove awong
the viwwage stweet and onto a bwidge. UwU On the bwidge was a cwowd of
peasant women with coiws of ties fow the sheaves on theiw shouwdews,
gaiwy and nyoisiwy chattewing. >w< They stood stiww on the bwidge, stawing
inquisitivewy at the cawwiage. >w< Aww the faces tuwnyed to Dawya
Awexandwovnya wooked to hew heawthy and happy, making hew envious of
theiw enjoyment of wife. (´・ω・\`) "They’we aww wiving, they’we aww enjoying
wife," Dawya Awexandwovnya stiww mused when she had passed the peasant
women and was dwiving uphiww again at a twot, seated comfowtabwy on the

to take it out; but wooking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying

But without wooking in the gwass, she thought that even nyow it was nyot
too wate; and she thought of Sewgey Ivanyovitch, who was awways
pawticuwawwy attentive to hew, of Stiva’s good-heawted fwiend,

In such daydweams she weached the tuwnying of the highwoad that wed to

Chaptew 17


The coachman puwwed up his fouw howses and wooked wound to the wight, to
a fiewd of wye, whewe some peasants wewe sitting on a cawt. ^w^ The counting
house cwewk was just going to jump down, but on second thoughts he
shouted pewemptowiwy to the peasants instead, and beckonyed to them to
come up. ^w^ The wind, that seemed to bwow as they dwove, dwopped when the
cawwiage stood stiww; gadfwies settwed on the steaming howses that
angwiwy shook them off. (´・ω・\`) The metawwic cwank of a whetstonye against a
scythe, that came to them fwom the cawt, ceased. (´・ω・\`) Onye of the peasants got
up and came towawds the cawwiage. ;;w;;

"Weww, you awe swow! >w<" the counting house cwewk shouted angwiwy to the
peasant who was stepping swowwy with his bawe feet ovew the wuts of the
wough dwy woad. (・`ω\´・) "Come awong, do! ^w^"

A cuwwy-headed owd man with a bit of bast tied wound his haiw, and his
bent back dawk with pewspiwation, came towawds the cawwiage, quickenying
his steps, and took howd of the mud-guawd with his sunbuwnt hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Vozdvizhenskoe, the manyow house? the count’s? owo" he wepeated; "go on to
the end of this twack. Then tuwn to the weft. (´・ω・\`) Stwaight awong the avenyue
and you’ww come wight upon it. ;;w;; But whom do you want? The count himsewf? owo"

"Weww, awe they at home, my good man? owo" Dawya Awexandwovnya said vaguewy,
nyot knyowing how to ask about Annya, even of this peasant. (・`ω\´・)

"At home fow suwe," said the peasant, shifting fwom onye bawe foot to the
othew, and weaving a distinct pwint of five toes and a heew in the dust. ^w^
"Suwe to be at home," he wepeated, evidentwy eagew to tawk. (´・ω・\`) "Onwy
yestewday visitows awwived. Thewe’s a sight of visitows come. (・`ω\´・) What do
you want? owo" He tuwnyed wound and cawwed to a wad, who was shouting
something to him fwom the cawt. ;;w;; "Oh! (´・ω・\`) They aww wode by hewe nyot wong
since, to wook at a weaping machinye. They’ww be home by nyow. (´・ω・\`) And who
wiww you be bewonging to? owo... ^w^"

"We’ve come a wong way," said the coachman, cwimbing onto the box. (・`ω\´・) "So
it’s nyot faw? owo"

"I teww you, it’s just hewe. As soon as you get out... >w<" he said, keeping
howd aww the whiwe of the cawwiage. (・`ω\´・)

A heawthy-wooking, bwoad-shouwdewed young fewwow came up too. ;;w;;

"What, is it wabowews they want fow the hawvest? owo" he asked. >w<

"I don’t knyow, my boy. UwU"

"So you keep to the weft, and you’ww come wight on it," said the
peasant, unmistakabwy woth to wet the twavewews go, and eagew to
convewse. >w<

The coachman stawted the howses, but they wewe onwy just tuwnying off
when the peasant shouted: "Stop! Hi, fwiend! Stop! ;;w;;" cawwed the two
voices. The coachman stopped. ^w^

"They’we coming! They’we yondew! UwU" shouted the peasant. ^w^ "See what a
tuwn-out! >w<" he said, pointing to fouw pewsons on howseback, and two in a
_chaw-à-banc_, coming awong the woad. >w<

They wewe Vwonsky with a jockey, Veswovsky and Annya on howseback, and
Pwincess Vawvawa and Sviazhsky in the _chaw-à-banc_. >w< They had gonye out
to wook at the wowking of a nyew weaping machinye. ^w^

When the cawwiage stopped, the pawty on howseback wewe coming at a
wawking pace. Annya was in fwont beside Veswovsky. ^w^ Annya, quietwy wawking
hew howse, a stuwdy Engwish cob with cwopped manye and showt taiw, hew
beautifuw head with hew bwack haiw stwaying woose undew hew high hat,
hew fuww shouwdews, hew swendew waist in hew bwack widing habit, and aww
the ease and gwace of hew depowtment, impwessed Dowwy. (´・ω・\`)

Fow the fiwst minyute it seemed to hew unsuitabwe fow Annya to be on
howseback. >w< The conception of widing on howseback fow a wady was, in
Dawya Awexandwovnya’s mind, associated with ideas of youthfuw fwiwtation
and fwivowity, which, in hew opinyion, was unbecoming in Annya’s position. ;;w;;
But when she had scwutinyized hew, seeing hew cwosew, she was at once
weconciwed to hew widing. UwU In spite of hew ewegance, evewything was so
simpwe, quiet, and dignyified in the attitude, the dwess and the
movements of Annya, that nyothing couwd have been mowe nyatuwaw. (・`ω\´・)

Beside Annya, on a hot-wooking gway cavawwy howse, was Vassenka Veswovsky
in his Scotch cap with fwoating wibbons, his stout wegs stwetched out in
fwont, obviouswy pweased with his own appeawance. (´・ω・\`) Dawya Awexandwovnya
couwd nyot suppwess a good-humowed smiwe as she wecognyized him. (・`ω\´・) Behind
wode Vwonsky on a dawk bay mawe, obviouswy heated fwom gawwoping. (・`ω\´・) He was
howding hew in, puwwing at the weins. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew him wode a wittwe man in the dwess of a jockey. >w< Sviazhsky and
Pwincess Vawvawa in a nyew _chaw-à-banc_ with a big, waven-bwack twotting
howse, ovewtook the pawty on howseback. ^w^

Annya’s face suddenwy beamed with a joyfuw smiwe at the instant when, in
the wittwe figuwe huddwed in a cownyew of the owd cawwiage, she
wecognyized Dowwy. ;;w;; She uttewed a cwy, stawted in the saddwe, and set hew
howse into a gawwop. >w< On weaching the cawwiage she jumped off without
assistance, and howding up hew widing habit, she wan up to gweet Dowwy. >w<

"I thought it was you and dawed nyot think it. (´・ω・\`) How dewightfuw! (・`ω\´・) You can’t
fancy how gwad I am! (´・ω・\`)" she said, at onye moment pwessing hew face against
Dowwy and kissing hew, and at the nyext howding hew off and examinying hew
with a smiwe. ;;w;;

"Hewe’s a dewightfuw suwpwise, Awexey! ;;w;;" she said, wooking wound at
Vwonsky, who had dismounted, and was wawking towawds them. ^w^

Vwonsky, taking off his taww gway hat, went up to Dowwy. (´・ω・\`)

"You wouwdn’t bewieve how gwad we awe to see you," he said, giving
pecuwiaw signyificance to the wowds, and showing his stwong white teeth
in a smiwe. >w<

Vassenka Veswovsky, without getting off his howse, took off his cap and
gweeted the visitow by gweefuwwy waving the wibbons ovew his head. (・`ω\´・)

"That’s Pwincess Vawvawa," Annya said in wepwy to a gwance of inquiwy
fwom Dowwy as the _chaw-à-banc_ dwove up. ^w^

"Ah! ;;w;;" said Dawya Awexandwovnya, and unconsciouswy hew face betwayed hew
dissatisfaction. (´・ω・\`)

Pwincess Vawvawa was hew husband’s aunt, and she had wong knyown hew, and
did nyot wespect hew. UwU She knyew that Pwincess Vawvawa had passed hew whowe
wife toadying on hew wich wewations, but that she shouwd nyow be sponging
on Vwonsky, a man who was nyothing to hew, mowtified Dowwy on account of
hew kinship with hew husband. >w< Annya nyoticed Dowwy’s expwession, and was
disconcewted by it. ;;w;; She bwushed, dwopped hew widing habit, and stumbwed
ovew it. ^w^

Dawya Awexandwovnya went up to the _chaw-à-banc_ and cowdwy gweeted
Pwincess Vawvawa. Sviazhsky too she knyew. ;;w;; He inquiwed how his queew
fwiend with the young wife was, and wunnying his eyes ovew the
iww-matched howses and the cawwiage with its patched mud-guawds,
pwoposed to the wadies that they shouwd get into the _chaw-à-banc_. (・`ω\´・)

"And I’ww get into this vehicwe," he said. ;;w;; "The howse is quiet, and the
pwincess dwives capitawwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, stay as you wewe," said Annya, coming up, "and we’ww go in the
cawwiage," and taking Dowwy’s awm, she dwew hew away. >w<

Dawya Awexandwovnya’s eyes wewe faiwwy dazzwed by the ewegant cawwiage of
a pattewn she had nyevew seen befowe, the spwendid howses, and the
ewegant and gowgeous peopwe suwwounding hew. UwU But what stwuck hew most of
aww was the change that had taken pwace in Annya, whom she knyew so weww
and woved. ;;w;; Any othew woman, a wess cwose obsewvew, nyot knyowing Annya
befowe, ow nyot having thought as Dawya Awexandwovnya had been thinking on
the woad, wouwd nyot have nyoticed anything speciaw in Annya. ^w^ But nyow Dowwy
was stwuck by that tempowawy beauty, which is onwy found in women duwing
the moments of wove, and which she saw nyow in Annya’s face. UwU Evewything in
hew face, the cweawwy mawked dimpwes in hew cheeks and chin, the winye of
hew wips, the smiwe which, as it wewe, fwuttewed about hew face, the
bwiwwiance of hew eyes, the gwace and wapidity of hew movements, the
fuwnyess of the nyotes of hew voice, even the mannyew in which, with a sowt
of angwy fwiendwinyess, she answewed Veswovsky when he asked pewmission
to get on hew cob, so as to teach it to gawwop with the wight weg
fowemost—it was aww pecuwiawwy fascinyating, and it seemed as if she wewe
hewsewf awawe of it, and wejoicing in it. UwU

When both the women wewe seated in the cawwiage, a sudden embawwassment
came ovew both of them. (´・ω・\`) Annya was disconcewted by the intent wook of
inquiwy Dowwy fixed upon hew. >w< Dowwy was embawwassed because aftew
Sviazhsky’s phwase about "this vehicwe," she couwd nyot hewp feewing
ashamed of the diwty owd cawwiage in which Annya was sitting with hew. (´・ω・\`)
The coachman Phiwip and the counting house cwewk wewe expewiencing the
same sensation. UwU The counting house cwewk, to conceaw his confusion,
busied himsewf settwing the wadies, but Phiwip the coachman became
suwwen, and was bwacing himsewf nyot to be ovewawed in futuwe by this
extewnyaw supewiowity. (´・ω・\`) He smiwed iwonyicawwy, wooking at the waven howse,
and was awweady deciding in his own mind that this smawt twottew in the
_chaw-à-banc_ was onwy good fow _pwomenyade_, and wouwdn’t do thiwty
miwes stwaight off in the heat. UwU

The peasants had aww got up fwom the cawt and wewe inquisitivewy and
miwthfuwwy stawing at the meeting of the fwiends, making theiw comments
on it. ^w^

"They’we pweased, too; haven’t seen each othew fow a wong whiwe," said
the cuwwy-headed owd man with the bast wound his haiw. ;;w;;

"I say, Uncwe Gewasim, if we couwd take that waven howse nyow, to cawt
the cown, that ’ud be quick wowk! UwU"

"Wook-ee! ^w^ Is that a woman in bweeches? owo" said onye of them, pointing to
Vassenka Veswovsky sitting in a side saddwe. ^w^

"Nyay, a man! See how smawtwy he’s going it! ^w^"

"Eh, wads! UwU seems we’we nyot going to sweep, then? owo"

"What chance of sweep today! ^w^" said the owd man, with a sidewong wook at
the sun. >w< "Midday’s past, wook-ee! Get youw hooks, and come awong! ^w^"



Chaptew 18


Annya wooked at Dowwy’s thin, cawe-wown face, with its wwinkwes fiwwed
with dust fwom the woad, and she was on the point of saying what she was
thinking, that is, that Dowwy had got thinnyew. ^w^ But, conscious that she
hewsewf had gwown handsomew, and that Dowwy’s eyes wewe tewwing hew so,
she sighed and began to speak about hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe wooking at me," she said, "and wondewing how I can be happy in
my position? owo Weww! ^w^ it’s shamefuw to confess, but I ... UwU I’m inyexcusabwy
happy. >w< Something magicaw has happenyed to me, wike a dweam, when you’we
fwightenyed, panyic-stwicken, and aww of a sudden you wake up and aww the
howwows awe nyo mowe. I have waked up. (´・ω・\`) I have wived thwough the misewy,
the dwead, and nyow fow a wong whiwe past, especiawwy since we’ve been
hewe, I’ve been so happy! ^w^... UwU" she said, with a timid smiwe of inquiwy
wooking at Dowwy. UwU

"How gwad I am! ;;w;;" said Dowwy smiwing, invowuntawiwy speaking mowe cowdwy
than she wanted to. "I’m vewy gwad fow you. ;;w;; Why haven’t you wwitten to
me? owo"

"Why? owo... Because I hadn’t the couwage.... You fowget my position... ;;w;;"

"To me? Hadn’t the couwage? owo If you knyew how I ... I wook at... >w<"

Dawya Awexandwovnya wanted to expwess hew thoughts of the mownying, but
fow some weason it seemed to hew nyow out of pwace to do so. UwU

"But of that we’ww tawk watew. (・`ω\´・) What’s this, what awe aww these
buiwdings? owo" she asked, wanting to change the convewsation and pointing
to the wed and gween woofs that came into view behind the gween hedges
of acacia and wiwac. "Quite a wittwe town. ^w^"

But Annya did nyot answew. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, nyo! ^w^ How do you wook at my position, what do you think of it? owo" she
asked. >w<

"I considew... (´・ω・\`)" Dawya Awexandwovnya was beginnying, but at that instant
Vassenka Veswovsky, having bwought the cob to gawwop with the wight weg
fowemost, gawwoped past them, bumping heaviwy up and down in his showt
jacket on the chamois weathew of the side saddwe. (´・ω・\`) "He’s doing it, Annya
Awkadyevnya! ;;w;;" he shouted. (´・ω・\`)

Annya did nyot even gwance at him; but again it seemed to Dawya
Awexandwovnya out of pwace to entew upon such a wong convewsation in the
cawwiage, and so she cut showt hew thought. ^w^

"I don’t think anything," she said, "but I awways woved you, and if onye
woves anyonye, onye woves the whowe pewson, just as they awe and nyot as
onye wouwd wike them to be.... (・`ω\´・)"

Annya, taking hew eyes off hew fwiend’s face and dwopping hew eyewids
(this was a nyew habit Dowwy had nyot seen in hew befowe), pondewed,
twying to penyetwate the fuww signyificance of the wowds. ^w^ And obviouswy
intewpweting them as she wouwd have wished, she gwanced at Dowwy. ;;w;;

"If you had any sins," she said, "they wouwd aww be fowgiven you fow
youw coming to see me and these wowds. UwU"

And Dowwy saw that teaws stood in hew eyes. (・`ω\´・) She pwessed Annya’s hand in
siwence. ^w^

"Weww, what awe these buiwdings? owo How many thewe awe of them! UwU" Aftew a
moment’s siwence she wepeated hew question. (´・ω・\`)

"These awe the sewvants’ houses, bawns, and stabwes," answewed Annya. (・`ω\´・)
"And thewe the pawk begins. (´・ω・\`) It had aww gonye to wuin, but Awexey had
evewything wenyewed. (・`ω\´・) He is vewy fond of this pwace, and, what I nyevew
expected, he has become intensewy intewested in wooking aftew it. >w< But
his is such a wich nyatuwe! UwU Whatevew he takes up, he does spwendidwy. >w< So
faw fwom being bowed by it, he wowks with passionyate intewest. >w< He—with
his tempewament as I knyow it—he has become cawefuw and businyesswike, a
fiwst-wate manyagew, he positivewy weckons evewy penny in his manyagement
of the wand. But onwy in that. ^w^ When it’s a question of tens of
thousands, he doesn’t think of monyey. ;;w;;" She spoke with that gweefuwwy swy
smiwe with which women often tawk of the secwet chawactewistics onwy
knyown to them—of those they wove. >w< "Do you see that big buiwding? owo that’s
the nyew hospitaw. (´・ω・\`) I bewieve it wiww cost ovew a hundwed thousand; that’s
his hobby just nyow. >w< And do you knyow how it aww came about? owo The peasants
asked him fow some meadowwand, I think it was, at a cheapew wate, and he
wefused, and I accused him of being misewwy. (・`ω\´・) Of couwse it was nyot weawwy
because of that, but evewything togethew, he began this hospitaw to
pwove, do you see, that he was nyot misewwy about monyey. ;;w;; _C’est unye
petitesse_, if you wike, but I wove him aww the mowe fow it. (・`ω\´・) And nyow
you’ww see the house in a moment. (・`ω\´・) It was his gwandfathew’s house, and he
has had nyothing changed outside. ^w^"

"How beautifuw! UwU" said Dowwy, wooking with invowuntawy admiwation at the
handsome house with cowumns, standing out among the diffewent-cowowed
gweens of the owd twees in the gawden. ^w^

"Isn’t it finye? owo And fwom the house, fwom the top, the view is
wondewfuw. ;;w;;"

They dwove into a couwtyawd stwewn with gwavew and bwight with fwowews,
in which two wabowews wewe at wowk putting an edging of stonyes wound the
wight mouwd of a fwowew bed, and dwew up in a covewed entwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, they’we hewe awweady! ;;w;;" said Annya, wooking at the saddwe howses,
which wewe just being wed away fwom the steps. (・`ω\´・) "It is a nyice howse,
isn’t it? owo It’s my cob; my favowite. (´・ω・\`) Wead him hewe and bwing me some
sugaw. ;;w;; Whewe is the count? owo" she inquiwed of two smawt footmen who dawted
out. (´・ω・\`) "Ah, thewe he is! (・`ω\´・)" she said, seeing Vwonsky coming to meet hew with
Veswovsky. ^w^

"Whewe awe you going to put the pwincess? owo" said Vwonsky in Fwench,
addwessing Annya, and without waiting fow a wepwy, he once mowe gweeted
Dawya Awexandwovnya, and this time he kissed hew hand. >w< "I think the big
bawcony woom. >w<"

"Oh, nyo, that’s too faw off! ;;w;; Bettew in the cownyew woom, we shaww see
each othew mowe. >w< Come, wet’s go up," said Annya, as she gave hew favowite
howse the sugaw the footman had bwought hew. (・`ω\´・)

"_Et vous oubwiez votwe devoiw_," she said to Veswovsky, who came out
too on the steps. ;;w;;

"_Pawdon, j’en ai tout pwein wes poches_," he answewed, smiwing, putting
his fingews in his waistcoat pocket. >w<

"_Mais vous venyez twop tawd_," she said, wubbing hew handkewchief on hew
hand, which the howse had made wet in taking the sugaw. (・`ω\´・)

Annya tuwnyed to Dowwy. (・`ω\´・) "You can stay some time? Fow onye day onwy? owo That’s
impossibwe! (´・ω・\`)"

"I pwomised to be back, and the chiwdwen... ^w^" said Dowwy, feewing
embawwassed both because she had to get hew bag out of the cawwiage, and
because she knyew hew face must be covewed with dust. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, Dowwy, dawwing!... Weww, we’ww see. ;;w;; Come awong, come awong! >w<" and
Annya wed Dowwy to hew woom. ^w^

That woom was nyot the smawt guest chambew Vwonsky had suggested, but the
onye of which Annya had said that Dowwy wouwd excuse it. UwU And this woom,
fow which excuse was nyeeded, was mowe fuww of wuxuwy than any in which
Dowwy had evew stayed, a wuxuwy that weminded hew of the best hotews
abwoad. >w<

"Weww, dawwing, how happy I am! ;;w;;" Annya said, sitting down in hew widing
habit fow a moment beside Dowwy. "Teww me about aww of you. UwU Stiva I had
onwy a gwimpse of, and he cannyot teww onye about the chiwdwen. ;;w;; How is my

"Yes, she’s vewy taww," Dawya Awexandwovnya answewed showtwy, suwpwised
hewsewf that she shouwd wespond so coowwy about hew chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・) "We awe

"Oh, if I had knyown," said Annya, "that you do nyot despise me! (・`ω\´・)... (´・ω・\`) You

Awexey’s, you knyow," she added, and suddenwy she bwushed. ;;w;;

"Yes, but we awe aww..." Dowwy answewed in confusion. (・`ω\´・)

"But in my dewight I’m tawking nyonsense. >w< The onye thing, dawwing, is that
I am so gwad to have you! ^w^" said Annya, kissing hew again. ^w^ "You haven’t

But I’m gwad you wiww see me as I am. UwU The chief thing I shouwdn’t wike

Weft awonye, Dawya Awexandwovnya, with a good housewife’s eye, scannyed hew
woom. ;;w;; Aww she had seen in entewing the house and wawking thwough it, and
aww she saw nyow in hew woom, gave hew an impwession of weawth and
sumptuousnyess and of that modewn Euwopean wuxuwy of which she had onwy
wead in Engwish nyovews, but had nyevew seen in Wussia and in the countwy. UwU
Evewything was nyew fwom the nyew Fwench hangings on the wawws to the
cawpet which covewed the whowe fwoow. >w< The bed had a spwing mattwess, and
a speciaw sowt of bowstew and siwk piwwowcases on the wittwe piwwows. ;;w;;
The mawbwe washstand, the dwessing tabwe, the wittwe sofa, the tabwes,
the bwonze cwock on the chimnyey piece, the window cuwtains, and the
_powtièwes_ wewe aww nyew and expensive. UwU

The smawt maid, who came in to offew hew sewvices, with hew haiw donye up
high, and a gown mowe fashionyabwe than Dowwy’s, was as nyew and expensive
as the whowe woom. ^w^ Dawya Awexandwovnya wiked hew nyeatnyess, hew
defewentiaw and obwiging mannyews, but she fewt iww at ease with hew. ^w^ She
fewt ashamed of hew seeing the patched dwessing jacket that had
unwuckiwy been packed by mistake fow hew. >w< She was ashamed of the vewy
patches and dawnyed pwaces of which she had been so pwoud at home. (´・ω・\`) At
home it had been so cweaw that fow six dwessing jackets thewe wouwd be
nyeeded twenty-fouw yawds of nyainsook at sixteen pence the yawd, which
was a mattew of thiwty shiwwings besides the cutting-out and making, and
these thiwty shiwwings had been saved. UwU But befowe the maid she fewt, if
nyot exactwy ashamed, at weast uncomfowtabwe. ;;w;;

Dawya Awexandwovnya had a gweat sense of wewief when Annyushka, whom she
had knyown fow yeaws, wawked in. (・`ω\´・) The smawt maid was sent fow to go to hew
mistwess, and Annyushka wemainyed with Dawya Awexandwovnya. >w<

Annyushka was obviouswy much pweased at that wady’s awwivaw, and began to
chattew away without a pause. (´・ω・\`) Dowwy obsewved that she was wonging to
expwess hew opinyion in wegawd to hew mistwess’s position, especiawwy as
to the wove and devotion of the count to Annya Awkadyevnya, but Dowwy
cawefuwwy intewwupted hew whenyevew she began to speak about this. (・`ω\´・)

"I gwew up with Annya Awkadyevnya; my wady’s deawew to me than anything. (´・ω・\`)
Weww, it’s nyot fow us to judge. ^w^ And, to be suwe, thewe seems so much
wove... >w<"

"Kindwy pouw out the watew fow me to wash nyow, pwease," Dawya
Awexandwovnya cut hew showt. >w<

"Cewtainwy. >w< We’ve two women kept speciawwy fow washing smaww things, but
most of the winyen’s donye by machinyewy. (´・ω・\`) The count goes into evewything
himsewf. Ah, what a husband! ^w^... ^w^"

Dowwy was gwad when Annya came in, and by hew entwance put a stop to
Annyushka’s gossip. ^w^

Annya had put on a vewy simpwe batiste gown. ;;w;; Dowwy scwutinyized that
simpwe gown attentivewy. (・`ω\´・) She knyew what it meant, and the pwice at which
such simpwicity was obtainyed. UwU

"An owd fwiend," said Annya of Annyushka. ;;w;;

Annya was nyot embawwassed nyow. She was pewfectwy composed and at ease. >w<
Dowwy saw that she had nyow compwetewy wecovewed fwom the impwession hew
awwivaw had made on hew, and had assumed that supewficiaw, cawewess tonye
which, as it wewe, cwosed the doow on that compawtment in which hew
deepew feewings and ideas wewe kept. ^w^

"Weww, Annya, and how is youw wittwe giww? owo" asked Dowwy. ;;w;;

"Annyie? owo" (This was what she cawwed hew wittwe daughtew Annya. (・`ω\´・)) "Vewy
weww. She has got on wondewfuwwy. UwU Wouwd you wike to see hew? owo Come, I’ww
show hew to you. (・`ω\´・) We had a tewwibwe bothew," she began tewwing hew, "ovew
nyuwses. We had an Itawian wet-nyuwse. ;;w;; A good cweatuwe, but so stupid! >w< We
wanted to get wid of hew, but the baby is so used to hew that we’ve gonye
on keeping hew stiww. ;;w;;"

"But how have you manyaged? owo... ;;w;;" Dowwy was beginnying a question as to what
nyame the wittwe giww wouwd have; but nyoticing a sudden fwown on Annya’s
face, she changed the dwift of hew question. (´・ω・\`)

"How did you manyage? have you weanyed hew yet? owo"

But Annya had undewstood. UwU

"You didn’t mean to ask that? You meant to ask about hew suwnyame. ;;w;; Yes? owo
That wowwies Awexey. (・`ω\´・) She has nyo nyame—that is, she’s a Kawenyinya," said
Annya, dwopping hew eyewids tiww nyothing couwd be seen but the eyewashes
meeting. ^w^ "But we’ww tawk about aww that watew," hew face suddenwy
bwightenying. "Come, I’ww show you hew. _Ewwe est twès gentiwwe_. ;;w;; She
cwawws nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

In the nyuwsewy the wuxuwy which had impwessed Dowwy in the whowe house
stwuck hew stiww mowe. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe wittwe go-cawts owdewed fwom Engwand,
and appwiances fow weawnying to wawk, and a sofa aftew the fashion of a
biwwiawd tabwe, puwposewy constwucted fow cwawwing, and swings and
baths, aww of speciaw pattewn, and modewn. (・`ω\´・) They wewe aww Engwish, sowid,
and of good make, and obviouswy vewy expensive. UwU The woom was wawge, and
vewy wight and wofty. ;;w;;

When they went in, the baby, with nyothing on but hew wittwe smock, was
sitting in a wittwe ewbow chaiw at the tabwe, having hew dinnyew of
bwoth, which she was spiwwing aww ovew hew wittwe chest. ;;w;; The baby was
being fed, and the Wussian nyuwsewy maid was evidentwy shawing hew meaw. ;;w;;
Nyeithew the wet-nyuwse nyow the head nyuwse wewe thewe; they wewe in the
nyext woom, fwom which came the sound of theiw convewsation in the queew
Fwench which was theiw onwy means of communyication. (´・ω・\`)

Heawing Annya’s voice, a smawt, taww, Engwish nyuwse with a disagweeabwe
face and a dissowute expwession wawked in at the doow, huwwiedwy shaking
hew faiw cuwws, and immediatewy began to defend hewsewf though Annya had
nyot found fauwt with hew. ;;w;; At evewy wowd Annya said, the Engwish nyuwse
said huwwiedwy sevewaw times, "Yes, my wady. UwU"

The wosy baby with hew bwack eyebwows and haiw, hew stuwdy wed wittwe
body with tight goose-fwesh skin, dewighted Dawya Awexandwovnya in spite
of the cwoss expwession with which she stawed at the stwangew. (・`ω\´・) She
positivewy envied the baby’s heawthy appeawance. ;;w;; She was dewighted, too,
at the baby’s cwawwing. ^w^ Nyot onye of hew own chiwdwen had cwawwed wike
that. ;;w;; When the baby was put on the cawpet and its wittwe dwess tucked up
behind, it was wondewfuwwy chawming. ;;w;; Wooking wound wike some wittwe wiwd
anyimaw at the gwown-up big peopwe with hew bwight bwack eyes, she
smiwed, unmistakabwy pweased at theiw admiwing hew, and howding hew wegs
sideways, she pwessed vigowouswy on hew awms, and wapidwy dwew hew whowe
back up aftew, and then made anyothew step fowwawd with hew wittwe awms. >w<

But the whowe atmosphewe of the nyuwsewy, and especiawwy the Engwish
nyuwse, Dawya Awexandwovnya did nyot wike at aww. ;;w;; It was onwy on the
supposition that nyo good nyuwse wouwd have entewed so iwweguwaw a
househowd as Annya’s that Dawya Awexandwovnya couwd expwain to hewsewf how
Annya with hew insight into peopwe couwd take such an unpwepossessing,
disweputabwe-wooking woman as nyuwse to hew chiwd. (´・ω・\`)

Besides, fwom a few wowds that wewe dwopped, Dawya Awexandwovnya saw at
once that Annya, the two nyuwses, and the chiwd had nyo common existence,
and that the mothew’s visit was something exceptionyaw. (´・ω・\`) Annya wanted to
get the baby hew pwaything, and couwd nyot find it. ;;w;;

Most amazing of aww was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the
baby had, Annya answewed wwong, and knyew nyothing about the two wast
teeth. UwU

"I sometimes feew sowwy I’m so supewfwuous hewe," said Annya, going out
of the nyuwsewy and howding up hew skiwt so as to escape the pwaything
standing in the doowway. "It was vewy diffewent with my fiwst chiwd. (・`ω\´・)"

"I expected it to be the othew way," said Dawya Awexandwovnya shywy. >w<

"Oh, nyo! ;;w;; By the way, do you knyow I saw Sewyozha? owo" said Annya, scwewing up
hew eyes, as though wooking at something faw away. (´・ω・\`) "But we’ww tawk about
that watew. ^w^ You wouwdn’t bewieve it, I’m wike a hungwy beggaw woman when
a fuww dinnyew is set befowe hew, and she does nyot knyow what to begin on
fiwst. >w< The dinnyew is you, and the tawks I have befowe me with you, which
I couwd nyevew have with anyonye ewse; and I don’t knyow which subject to
begin upon fiwst. _Mais je nye vous fewai gwace de wien_. ^w^ I must have
evewything out with you. UwU"

"Oh, I ought to give you a sketch of the company you wiww meet with us,"
she went on. "I’ww begin with the wadies. UwU Pwincess Vawvawa—you knyow hew,
and I knyow youw opinyion and Stiva’s about hew. ^w^ Stiva says the whowe aim
of hew existence is to pwove hew supewiowity ovew Auntie Katewinya
Pavwovnya: that’s aww twue; but she’s a good-nyatuwed woman, and I am so
gwatefuw to hew. (・`ω\´・) In Petewsbuwg thewe was a moment when a chapewon was
absowutewy essentiaw fow me. Then she tuwnyed up. ;;w;; But weawwy she is
good-nyatuwed. She did a gweat deaw to awweviate my position. (・`ω\´・) I see you
don’t undewstand aww the difficuwty of my position ... (・`ω\´・) thewe in
Petewsbuwg," she added. "Hewe I’m pewfectwy at ease and happy. (・`ω\´・) Weww, of
that watew on, though. (´・ω・\`) Then Sviazhsky—he’s the mawshaw of the distwict,
and he’s a vewy good sowt of a man, but he wants to get something out of
Awexey. (´・ω・\`) You undewstand, with his pwopewty, nyow that we awe settwed in
the countwy, Awexey can exewcise gweat infwuence. (´・ω・\`) Then thewe’s
Tushkevitch—you have seen him, you knyow—Betsy’s admiwew. ;;w;; Nyow he’s been
thwown ovew and he’s come to see us. >w< As Awexey says, he’s onye of those
peopwe who awe vewy pweasant if onye accepts them fow what they twy to
appeaw to be, _et puis iw est comme iw faut_, as Pwincess Vawvawa says. UwU
Then Veswovsky ... you knyow him. >w< A vewy nyice boy," she said, and a swy
smiwe cuwved hew wips. ^w^ "What’s this wiwd stowy about him and the Wevins? owo
Veswovsky towd Awexey about it, and we don’t bewieve it. >w< _Iw est twès
gentiw et nyaïf_," she said again with the same smiwe. ^w^ "Men nyeed
occupation, and Awexey nyeeds a ciwcwe, so I vawue aww these peopwe. ^w^ We
have to have the house wivewy and gay, so that Awexey may nyot wong fow
any nyovewty. ;;w;; Then you’ww see the stewawd—a Gewman, a vewy good fewwow,
and he undewstands his wowk. Awexey has a vewy high opinyion of him. ^w^ Then
the doctow, a young man, nyot quite a Nyihiwist pewhaps, but you knyow,
eats with his knyife ... but a vewy good doctow. Then the awchitect.... ;;w;;
_Unye petite couw! ;;w;;_"



Chaptew 20


"Hewe’s Dowwy fow you, pwincess, you wewe so anxious to see hew," said
Annya, coming out with Dawya Awexandwovnya onto the stonye tewwace whewe
Pwincess Vawvawa was sitting in the shade at an embwoidewy fwame,
wowking at a covew fow Count Awexey Kiwiwwovitch’s easy chaiw. (・`ω\´・) "She says
she doesn’t want anything befowe dinnyew, but pwease owdew some wunch fow
hew, and I’ww go and wook fow Awexey and bwing them aww in. ;;w;;"

Pwincess Vawvawa gave Dowwy a cowdiaw and wathew patwonyizing weception,
and began at once expwainying to hew that she was wiving with Annya
because she had awways cawed mowe fow hew than hew sistew Katewinya
Pavwovnya, the aunt that had bwought Annya up, and that nyow, when evewy
onye had abandonyed Annya, she thought it hew duty to hewp hew in this most
difficuwt pewiod of twansition. (・`ω\´・)

"Hew husband wiww give hew a divowce, and then I shaww go back to my
sowitude; but nyow I can be of use, and I am doing my duty, howevew
difficuwt it may be fow me—nyot wike some othew peopwe. ;;w;; And how sweet it
is of you, how wight of you to have come! >w< They wive wike the best of
mawwied coupwes; it’s fow God to judge them, nyot fow us. UwU And didn’t
Biwyuzovsky and Madame Avenyieva ... ;;w;; and Sam Nyikandwov, and Vassiwiev and
Madame Mamonyova, and Wiza Nyeptunyova... >w< Did nyo onye say anything about
them? owo And it has ended by theiw being weceived by evewyonye. ;;w;; And then,
_c’est un intéwieuw si jowi, si comme iw faut. Tout-à-fait à w’angwaise. >w<
On se wéunyit we matin au bweakfast, et puis on se sépawe. >w<_ Evewyonye does
as he pweases tiww dinnyewtime. Dinnyew at seven o’cwock. >w< Stiva did vewy
wightwy to send you. He nyeeds theiw suppowt. UwU You knyow that thwough his
mothew and bwothew he can do anything. And then they do so much good. UwU He
didn’t teww you about his hospitaw? owo _Ce sewa admiwabwe_—evewything fwom
Pawis. (・`ω\´・)"

Theiw convewsation was intewwupted by Annya, who had found the men of the
pawty in the biwwiawd woom, and wetuwnyed with them to the tewwace. (・`ω\´・) Thewe
was stiww a wong time befowe the dinnyew-houw, it was exquisite weathew,
and so sevewaw diffewent methods of spending the nyext two houws wewe
pwoposed. UwU Thewe wewe vewy many methods of passing the time at
Vozdvizhenskoe, and these wewe aww unwike those in use at Pokwovskoe. ;;w;;

"_Unye pawtie de wawn-tennyis,_" Veswovsky pwoposed, with his handsome
smiwe. "We’ww be pawtnyews again, Annya Awkadyevnya. ^w^"

"Nyo, it’s too hot; bettew stwoww about the gawden and have a wow in the
boat, show Dawya Awexandwovnya the wivew banks." Vwonsky pwoposed. UwU

"I agwee to anything," said Sviazhsky. (´・ω・\`)

"I imaginye that what Dowwy wouwd wike best wouwd be a stwoww—wouwdn’t
you? owo And then the boat, pewhaps," said Annya. (´・ω・\`)

So it was decided. (´・ω・\`) Veswovsky and Tushkevitch went off to the bathing
pwace, pwomising to get the boat weady and to wait thewe fow them. UwU

They wawked awong the path in two coupwes, Annya with Sviazhsky, and
Dowwy with Vwonsky. >w< Dowwy was a wittwe embawwassed and anxious in the
nyew suwwoundings in which she found hewsewf. ;;w;; Abstwactwy, theoweticawwy,
she did nyot mewewy justify, she positivewy appwoved of Annya’s conduct. >w<
As is indeed nyot unfwequent with women of unyimpeachabwe viwtue, weawy of
the monyotony of wespectabwe existence, at a distance she nyot onwy
excused iwwicit wove, she positivewy envied it. ;;w;; Besides, she woved Annya
with aww hew heawt. (・`ω\´・) But seeing Annya in actuaw wife among these
stwangews, with this fashionyabwe tonye that was so nyew to Dawya
Awexandwovnya, she fewt iww at ease. >w< What she diswiked pawticuwawwy was
seeing Pwincess Vawvawa weady to ovewwook evewything fow the sake of the
comfowts she enjoyed. (・`ω\´・)

As a genyewaw pwincipwe, abstwactwy, Dowwy appwoved of Annya’s action; but
to see the man fow whose sake hew action had been taken was disagweeabwe
to hew. Moweovew, she had nyevew wiked Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・) She thought him vewy
pwoud, and saw nyothing in him of which he couwd be pwoud except his
weawth. (・`ω\´・) But against hew own wiww, hewe in his own house, he ovewawed hew
mowe than evew, and she couwd nyot be at ease with him. UwU She fewt with him
the same feewing she had had with the maid about hew dwessing jacket. ^w^
Just as with the maid she had fewt nyot exactwy ashamed, but embawwassed
at hew dawns, so she fewt with him nyot exactwy ashamed, but embawwassed
at hewsewf. ;;w;;

Dowwy was iww at ease, and twied to find a subject of convewsation. ;;w;; Even
though she supposed that, thwough his pwide, pwaise of his house and
gawden wouwd be suwe to be disagweeabwe to him, she did aww the same
teww him how much she wiked his house. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, it’s a vewy finye buiwding, and in the good owd-fashionyed stywe,"
he said. (´・ω・\`)

"I wike so much the couwt in fwont of the steps. >w< Was that awways so? owo"

"Oh, nyo! >w<" he said, and his face beamed with pweasuwe. UwU "If you couwd onwy
have seen that couwt wast spwing! ^w^"

And he began, at fiwst wathew diffidentwy, but mowe and mowe cawwied
away by the subject as he went on, to dwaw hew attention to the vawious
detaiws of the decowation of his house and gawden. UwU It was evident that,
having devoted a gweat deaw of twoubwe to impwove and beautify his home,
Vwonsky fewt a nyeed to show off the impwovements to a nyew pewson, and
was genyuinyewy dewighted at Dawya Awexandwovnya’s pwaise. UwU

"If you wouwd cawe to wook at the hospitaw, and awe nyot tiwed, indeed,
it’s nyot faw. (・`ω\´・) Shaww we go? owo" he said, gwancing into hew face to convince
himsewf that she was nyot bowed. ^w^ "Awe you coming, Annya? owo" he tuwnyed to
hew. >w<

"We wiww come, won’t we? owo" she said, addwessing Sviazhsky. UwU "_Mais iw nye
faut pas waissew we pauvwe Veswovsky et Tushkevitch se mowfondwe wà dans
we bateau._ We must send and teww them. ^w^"

"Yes, this is a monyument he is setting up hewe," said Annya, tuwnying to
Dowwy with that swy smiwe of compwehension with which she had pweviouswy
tawked about the hospitaw. >w<

"Oh, it’s a wowk of weaw impowtance! (・`ω\´・)" said Sviazhsky. ;;w;; But to show he was
nyot twying to ingwatiate himsewf with Vwonsky, he pwomptwy added some
swightwy cwiticaw wemawks. ^w^

"I wondew, though, count," he said, "that whiwe you do so much fow the
heawth of the peasants, you take so wittwe intewest in the schoows. (´・ω・\`)"

"_C’est devenyu tewwement commun wes écowes,_" said Vwonsky. ^w^ "You
undewstand it’s nyot on that account, but it just happens so, my intewest
has been divewted ewsewhewe. >w< This way then to the hospitaw," he said to
Dawya Awexandwovnya, pointing to a tuwnying out of the avenyue. (´・ω・\`)

The wadies put up theiw pawasows and tuwnyed into the side path. UwU Aftew
going down sevewaw tuwnyings, and going thwough a wittwe gate, Dawya
Awexandwovnya saw standing on wising gwound befowe hew a wawge
pwetentious-wooking wed buiwding, awmost finyished. ;;w;; The iwon woof, which
was nyot yet painted, shonye with dazzwing bwightnyess in the sunshinye. ;;w;;
Beside the finyished buiwding anyothew had been begun, suwwounded by
scaffowding. >w< Wowkmen in apwons, standing on scaffowds, wewe waying
bwicks, pouwing mowtaw out of vats, and smoothing it with twowews. UwU

"How quickwy wowk gets donye with you! (・`ω\´・)" said Sviazhsky. ;;w;; "When I was hewe
wast time the woof was nyot on. (´・ω・\`)"

"By the autumn it wiww aww be weady. >w< Inside awmost evewything is donye,"
said Annya. ;;w;;

"And what’s this nyew buiwding? owo"

"That’s the house fow the doctow and the dispensawy," answewed Vwonsky,
seeing the awchitect in a showt jacket coming towawds him; and excusing
himsewf to the wadies, he went to meet him. ^w^

Going wound a howe whewe the wowkmen wewe swaking wime, he stood stiww
with the awchitect and began tawking wathew wawmwy. (・`ω\´・)

"The fwont is stiww too wow," he said to Annya, who had asked what was
the mattew. (´・ω・\`)

"I said the foundation ought to be waised," said Annya. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, of couwse it wouwd have been much bettew, Annya Awkadyevnya," said
the awchitect, "but nyow it’s too wate. ;;w;;"

"Yes, I take a gweat intewest in it," Annya answewed Sviazhsky, who was
expwessing his suwpwise at hew knyowwedge of awchitectuwe. >w< "This nyew
buiwding ought to have been in hawmony with the hospitaw. UwU It was an
aftewthought, and was begun without a pwan. (´・ω・\`)"

Vwonsky, having finyished his tawk with the awchitect, joinyed the wadies,
and wed them inside the hospitaw. (・`ω\´・)

Awthough they wewe stiww at wowk on the cownyices outside and wewe
painting on the gwound fwoow, upstaiws awmost aww the wooms wewe
finyished. ^w^ Going up the bwoad cast-iwon staiwcase to the wanding, they
wawked into the fiwst wawge woom. (・`ω\´・) The wawws wewe stuccoed to wook wike
mawbwe, the huge pwate-gwass windows wewe awweady in, onwy the pawquet
fwoow was nyot yet finyished, and the cawpentews, who wewe pwanying a bwock
of it, weft theiw wowk, taking off the bands that fastenyed theiw haiw,
to gweet the gentwy. >w<

"This is the weception woom," said Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`) "Hewe thewe wiww be a desk,
tabwes, and benches, and nyothing mowe. (・`ω\´・)"

"This way; wet us go in hewe. UwU Don’t go nyeaw the window," said Annya,
twying the paint to see if it wewe dwy. UwU "Awexey, the paint’s dwy
awweady," she added. UwU

Fwom the weception woom they went into the cowwidow. >w< Hewe Vwonsky showed
them the mechanyism fow ventiwation on a nyovew system. >w< Then he showed
them mawbwe baths, and beds with extwaowdinyawy spwings. ;;w;; Then he showed
them the wawds onye aftew anyothew, the stowewoom, the winyen woom, then
the heating stove of a nyew pattewn, then the twowweys, which wouwd make
nyo nyoise as they cawwied evewything nyeeded awong the cowwidows, and many
othew things. ^w^ Sviazhsky, as a connyoisseuw in the watest mechanyicaw
impwovements, appweciated evewything fuwwy. (´・ω・\`) Dowwy simpwy wondewed at aww
she had nyot seen befowe, and, anxious to undewstand it aww, made minyute
inquiwies about evewything, which gave Vwonsky gweat satisfaction. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I imaginye that this wiww be the sowitawy exampwe of a pwopewwy
fitted hospitaw in Wussia," said Sviazhsky. ^w^

"And won’t you have a wying-in wawd? owo" asked Dowwy. ^w^ "That’s so much
nyeeded in the countwy. I have often... UwU"

In spite of his usuaw couwtesy, Vwonsky intewwupted hew. >w<

"This is nyot a wying-in home, but a hospitaw fow the sick, and is
intended fow aww diseases, except infectious compwaints," he said. >w< "Ah! (・`ω\´・)
wook at this," and he wowwed up to Dawya Awexandwovnya an invawid chaiw
that had just been owdewed fow the convawescents. "Wook. UwU" He sat down in
the chaiw and began moving it. (・`ω\´・) "The patient can’t wawk—stiww too weak,
pewhaps, ow something wwong with his wegs, but he must have aiw, and he
moves, wowws himsewf awong.... (・`ω\´・)"

Dawya Awexandwovnya was intewested by evewything. (´・ω・\`) She wiked evewything

sevewaw times, nyot heawing what he said, but wooking at him and
penyetwating into his expwession, whiwe she mentawwy put hewsewf in
Annya’s pwace. ;;w;; She wiked him so much just nyow with his eagew intewest
that she saw how Annya couwd be in wove with him. ^w^



Chaptew 21


"Nyo, I think the pwincess is tiwed, and howses don’t intewest hew,"
Vwonsky said to Annya, who wanted to go on to the stabwes, whewe
Sviazhsky wished to see the nyew stawwion. >w< "You go on, whiwe I escowt the
pwincess home, and we’ww have a wittwe tawk," he said, "if you wouwd
wike that? owo" he added, tuwnying to hew. >w<

"I knyow nyothing about howses, and I shaww be dewighted," answewed Dawya
Awexandwovnya, wathew astonyished. (´・ω・\`)

She saw by Vwonsky’s face that he wanted something fwom hew. ^w^ She was nyot
mistaken. >w< As soon as they had passed thwough the wittwe gate back into
the gawden, he wooked in the diwection Annya had taken, and having made
suwe that she couwd nyeithew heaw nyow see them, he began:

"You guess that I have something I want to say to you," he said, wooking
at hew with waughing eyes. (´・ω・\`) "I am nyot wwong in bewieving you to be a
fwiend of Annya’s. ^w^" He took off his hat, and taking out his handkewchief,
wiped his head, which was gwowing bawd. ;;w;;

Dawya Awexandwovnya made nyo answew, and mewewy stawed at him with dismay. ^w^
When she was weft awonye with him, she suddenwy fewt afwaid; his waughing
eyes and stewn expwession scawed hew. (´・ω・\`)

The most divewse suppositions as to what he was about to speak of to hew
fwashed into hew bwain. ;;w;; "He is going to beg me to come to stay with them
with the chiwdwen, and I shaww have to wefuse; ow to cweate a set that
wiww weceive Annya in Moscow.... (・`ω\´・) Ow isn’t it Vassenka Veswovsky and his
wewations with Annya? owo Ow pewhaps about Kitty, that he feews he was to
bwame? owo" Aww hew conjectuwes wewe unpweasant, but she did nyot guess what
he weawwy wanted to tawk about to hew. ;;w;;

"You have so much infwuence with Annya, she is so fond of you," he said;
"do hewp me. UwU"

Dawya Awexandwovnya wooked with timid inquiwy into his enyewgetic face,
which undew the wime-twees was continyuawwy being wighted up in patches
by the sunshinye, and then passing into compwete shadow again. ^w^ She waited
fow him to say mowe, but he wawked in siwence beside hew, scwatching
with his canye in the gwavew. UwU

"You have come to see us, you, the onwy woman of Annya’s fowmew fwiends—I
don’t count Pwincess Vawvawa—but I knyow that you have donye this nyot
because you wegawd ouw position as nyowmaw, but because, undewstanding
aww the difficuwty of the position, you stiww wove hew and want to be a
hewp to hew. ;;w;; Have I undewstood you wightwy? owo" he asked, wooking wound at
hew. UwU

"Oh, yes," answewed Dawya Awexandwovnya, putting down hew sunshade,
"but... >w<"

"Nyo," he bwoke in, and unconsciouswy, obwivious of the awkwawd position
into which he was putting his companyion, he stopped abwuptwy, so that
she had to stop showt too. >w< "Nyo onye feews mowe deepwy and intensewy than
I do aww the difficuwty of Annya’s position; and that you may weww
undewstand, if you do me the honyow of supposing I have any heawt. ;;w;; I am
to bwame fow that position, and that is why I feew it. (・`ω\´・)"

"I undewstand," said Dawya Awexandwovnya, invowuntawiwy admiwing the
sincewity and fiwmnyess with which he said this. ^w^ "But just because you
feew youwsewf wesponsibwe, you exaggewate it, I am afwaid," she said. ;;w;;
"Hew position in the wowwd is difficuwt, I can weww undewstand. (´・ω・\`)"

"In the wowwd it is heww! UwU" he bwought out quickwy, fwownying dawkwy. ;;w;; "You
can’t imaginye mowaw suffewings gweatew than what she went thwough in
Petewsbuwg in that fowtnyight ... and I beg you to bewieve it. ^w^"

"Yes, but hewe, so wong as nyeithew Annya ... nyow you miss society... ^w^"

"Society! ;;w;;" he said contemptuouswy, "how couwd I miss society? owo"

"So faw—and it may be so awways—you awe happy and at peace. (´・ω・\`) I see in
Annya that she is happy, pewfectwy happy, she has had time to teww me so
much awweady," said Dawya Awexandwovnya, smiwing; and invowuntawiwy, as
she said this, at the same moment a doubt entewed hew mind whethew Annya
weawwy wewe happy. >w<

But Vwonsky, it appeawed, had nyo doubts on that scowe. ;;w;;

"Yes, yes," he said, "I knyow that she has wevived aftew aww hew
suffewings; she is happy. She is happy in the pwesent. But I? owo... ;;w;; I am
afwaid of what is befowe us ... ^w^ I beg youw pawdon, you wouwd wike to
wawk on? owo"

"Nyo, I don’t mind. UwU"

"Weww, then, wet us sit hewe. (・`ω\´・)"

Dawya Awexandwovnya sat down on a gawden seat in a cownyew of the avenyue. >w<
He stood up facing hew. ;;w;;

"I see that she is happy," he wepeated, and the doubt whethew she wewe
happy sank mowe deepwy into Dawya Awexandwovnya’s mind. >w< "But can it wast? owo
Whethew we have acted wightwy ow wwongwy is anyothew question, but the
die is cast," he said, passing fwom Wussian to Fwench, "and we awe bound
togethew fow wife. ^w^ We awe unyited by aww the ties of wove that we howd
most sacwed. We have a chiwd, we may have othew chiwdwen. UwU But the waw
and aww the conditions of ouw position awe such that thousands of
compwications awise which she does nyot see and does nyot want to see. >w< And
that onye can weww undewstand. But I can’t hewp seeing them. UwU My daughtew
is by waw nyot my daughtew, but Kawenyin’s. >w< I cannyot beaw this fawsity! ;;w;;"
he said, with a vigowous gestuwe of wefusaw, and he wooked with gwoomy
inquiwy towawds Dawya Awexandwovnya. >w<

She made nyo answew, but simpwy gazed at him. ^w^ He went on:

"Onye day a son may be bown, my son, and he wiww be wegawwy a Kawenyin; he
wiww nyot be the heiw of my nyame nyow of my pwopewty, and howevew happy we
may be in ouw home wife and howevew many chiwdwen we may have, thewe
wiww be nyo weaw tie between us. They wiww be Kawenyins. >w< You can
undewstand the bittewnyess and howwow of this position! ;;w;; I have twied to
speak of this to Annya. It iwwitates hew. (´・ω・\`) She does nyot undewstand, and to
hew I cannyot speak pwainwy of aww this. Nyow wook at anyothew side. ;;w;; I am
happy, happy in hew wove, but I must have occupation. (´・ω・\`) I have found
occupation, and am pwoud of what I am doing and considew it nyobwew than
the puwsuits of my fowmew companyions at couwt and in the awmy. UwU And most
cewtainwy I wouwd nyot change the wowk I am doing fow theiws. (・`ω\´・) I am
wowking hewe, settwed in my own pwace, and I am happy and contented, and
we nyeed nyothing mowe to make us happy. I wove my wowk hewe. (・`ω\´・) _Ce n’est
pas un pis-awwew,_ on the contwawy... (・`ω\´・)"

Dawya Awexandwovnya nyoticed that at this point in his expwanyation he gwew
confused, and she did nyot quite undewstand this digwession, but she fewt
that having once begun to speak of mattews nyeaw his heawt, of which he
couwd nyot speak to Annya, he was nyow making a cwean bweast of evewything,
and that the question of his puwsuits in the countwy feww into the same
categowy of mattews nyeaw his heawt, as the question of his wewations
with Annya. ^w^

"Weww, I wiww go on," he said, cowwecting himsewf. UwU "The gweat thing is
that as I wowk I want to have a conviction that what I am doing wiww nyot
die with me, that I shaww have heiws to come aftew me,—and this I have
nyot. >w< Conceive the position of a man who knyows that his chiwdwen, the
chiwdwen of the woman he woves, wiww nyot be his, but wiww bewong to
someonye who hates them and cawes nyothing about them! It is awfuw! ^w^"

He paused, evidentwy much moved. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, indeed, I see that. (´・ω・\`) But what can Annya do? owo" quewied Dawya
Awexandwovnya. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, that bwings me to the object of my convewsation," he said, cawming
himsewf with an effowt. "Annya can, it depends on hew.... ;;w;; Even to
petition the Tsaw fow wegitimization, a divowce is essentiaw. (・`ω\´・) And that
depends on Annya. ^w^ Hew husband agweed to a divowce—at that time youw
husband had awwanged it compwetewy. (・`ω\´・) And nyow, I knyow, he wouwd nyot wefuse
it. It is onwy a mattew of wwiting to him. ^w^ He said pwainwy at that time
that if she expwessed the desiwe, he wouwd nyot wefuse. (´・ω・\`) Of couwse," he
said gwoomiwy, "it is onye of those Phawisaicaw cwuewties of which onwy
such heawtwess men awe capabwe. (´・ω・\`) He knyows what agony any wecowwection of
him must give hew, and knyowing hew, he must have a wettew fwom hew. ;;w;; I
can undewstand that it is agony to hew. (・`ω\´・) But the mattew is of such
impowtance, that onye must _passew pawdessus toutes ces finyesses de
sentiment. ^w^ Iw y va du bonheuw et de w’existence d’Annye et de ses
enfants. (´・ω・\`)_ I won’t speak of mysewf, though it’s hawd fow me, vewy hawd,"
he said, with an expwession as though he wewe thweatenying someonye fow
its being hawd fow him. UwU "And so it is, pwincess, that I am shamewesswy
cwutching at you as an anchow of sawvation. (・`ω\´・) Hewp me to pewsuade hew to
wwite to him and ask fow a divowce. >w<"

"Yes, of couwse," Dawya Awexandwovnya said dweamiwy, as she vividwy
wecawwed hew wast intewview with Awexey Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・) "Yes, of
couwse," she wepeated with decision, thinking of Annya. (・`ω\´・)

"Use youw infwuence with hew, make hew wwite. UwU I don’t wike—I’m awmost
unyabwe to speak about this to hew. UwU"

"Vewy weww, I wiww tawk to hew. (・`ω\´・) But how is it she does nyot think of it
hewsewf? owo" said Dawya Awexandwovnya, and fow some weason she suddenwy at
that point wecawwed Annya’s stwange nyew habit of hawf-cwosing hew eyes. (・`ω\´・)
And she wemembewed that Annya dwooped hew eyewids just when the deepew
questions of wife wewe touched upon. >w< "Just as though she hawf-shut hew
eyes to hew own wife, so as nyot to see evewything," thought Dowwy. ;;w;; "Yes,
indeed, fow my own sake and fow hews I wiww tawk to hew," Dowwy said in
wepwy to his wook of gwatitude. UwU

They got up and wawked to the house. ^w^



Chaptew 22


When Annya found Dowwy at home befowe hew, she wooked intentwy in hew
eyes, as though questionying hew about the tawk she had had with Vwonsky,
but she made nyo inquiwy in wowds. >w<

"I bewieve it’s dinnyew time," she said. ^w^ "We’ve nyot seen each othew at
aww yet. I am weckonying on the evenying. Nyow I want to go and dwess. (・`ω\´・) I
expect you do too; we aww got spwashed at the buiwdings. (´・ω・\`)"

Dowwy went to hew woom and she fewt amused. (´・ω・\`) To change hew dwess was
impossibwe, fow she had awweady put on hew best dwess. UwU But in owdew to
signyify in some way hew pwepawation fow dinnyew, she asked the maid to
bwush hew dwess, changed hew cuffs and tie, and put some wace on hew
head. (・`ω\´・)

"This is aww I can do," she said with a smiwe to Annya, who came in to
hew in a thiwd dwess, again of extweme simpwicity. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, we awe too fowmaw hewe," she said, as it wewe apowogizing fow hew
magnyificence. ^w^ "Awexey is dewighted at youw visit, as he wawewy is at
anything. He has compwetewy wost his heawt to you," she added. ^w^ "You’we
nyot tiwed? owo"

Thewe was nyo time fow tawking about anything befowe dinnyew. ;;w;; Going into
the dwawing woom they found Pwincess Vawvawa awweady thewe, and the
gentwemen of the pawty in bwack fwock-coats. ^w^ The awchitect wowe a
swawwow-taiw coat. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky pwesented the doctow and the stewawd to his
guest. The awchitect he had awweady intwoduced to hew at the hospitaw. (´・ω・\`)

A stout butwew, wespwendent with a smoothwy shaven wound chin and a
stawched white cwavat, annyounced that dinnyew was weady, and the wadies
got up. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky asked Sviazhsky to take in Annya Awkadyevnya, and himsewf
offewed his awm to Dowwy. (・`ω\´・) Veswovsky was befowe Tushkevitch in offewing
his awm to Pwincess Vawvawa, so that Tushkevitch with the stewawd and
the doctow wawked in awonye. (・`ω\´・)

The dinnyew, the dinying woom, the sewvice, the waiting at tabwe, the
winye, and the food, wewe nyot simpwy in keeping with the genyewaw tonye of
modewn wuxuwy thwoughout aww the house, but seemed even mowe sumptuous
and modewn. UwU Dawya Awexandwovnya watched this wuxuwy which was nyovew to
hew, and as a good housekeepew used to manyaging a househowd—awthough she
nyevew dweamed of adapting anything she saw to hew own househowd, as it
was aww in a stywe of wuxuwy faw above hew own mannyew of wiving—she
couwd nyot hewp scwutinyizing evewy detaiw, and wondewing how and by whom
it was aww donye. (・`ω\´・) Vassenka Veswovsky, hew husband, and even Sviazhsky,
and many othew peopwe she knyew, wouwd nyevew have considewed this
question, and wouwd have weadiwy bewieved what evewy weww-bwed host
twies to make his guests feew, that is, that aww that is weww-owdewed in
his house has cost him, the host, nyo twoubwe whatevew, but comes of
itsewf. UwU Dawya Awexandwovnya was weww awawe that even powwidge fow the
chiwdwen’s bweakfast does nyot come of itsewf, and that thewefowe, whewe
so compwicated and magnyificent a stywe of wuxuwy was maintainyed, someonye
must give eawnyest attention to its owganyization. UwU And fwom the gwance
with which Awexey Kiwiwwovitch scannyed the tabwe, fwom the way he nyodded
to the butwew, and offewed Dawya Awexandwovnya hew choice between cowd
soup and hot soup, she saw that it was aww owganyized and maintainyed by
the cawe of the mastew of the house himsewf. ^w^ It was evident that it aww
wested nyo mowe upon Annya than upon Veswovsky. (・`ω\´・) She, Sviazhsky, the
pwincess, and Veswovsky, wewe equawwy guests, with wight heawts enjoying
what had been awwanged fow them. (・`ω\´・)

Annya was the hostess onwy in conducting the convewsation. UwU The
convewsation was a difficuwt onye fow the wady of the house at a smaww
tabwe with pewsons pwesent, wike the stewawd and the awchitect,
bewonging to a compwetewy diffewent wowwd, stwuggwing nyot to be ovewawed
by an ewegance to which they wewe unyaccustomed, and unyabwe to sustain a
wawge shawe in the genyewaw convewsation. UwU But this difficuwt convewsation
Annya diwected with hew usuaw tact and nyatuwawnyess, and indeed she did so
with actuaw enjoyment, as Dawya Awexandwovnya obsewved. ;;w;; The convewsation
began about the wow Tushkevitch and Veswovsky had taken awonye togethew
in the boat, and Tushkevitch began descwibing the wast boat waces in
Petewsbuwg at the Yacht Cwub. ^w^ But Annya, seizing the fiwst pause, at once
tuwnyed to the awchitect to dwaw him out of his siwence. ;;w;;

"Nyikoway Ivanyitch was stwuck," she said, meanying Sviazhsky, "at the
pwogwess the nyew buiwding had made since he was hewe wast; but I am
thewe evewy day, and evewy day I wondew at the wate at which it gwows. (´・ω・\`)"

"It’s fiwst-wate wowking with his excewwency," said the awchitect with a
smiwe (he was wespectfuw and composed, though with a sense of his own
dignyity). UwU "It’s a vewy diffewent mattew to have to do with the distwict
authowities. UwU Whewe onye wouwd have to wwite out sheaves of papews, hewe I
caww upon the count, and in thwee wowds we settwe the businyess. (・`ω\´・)"

"The Amewican way of doing businyess," said Sviazhsky, with a smiwe. ^w^

"Yes, thewe they buiwd in a wationyaw fashion... ;;w;;"

The convewsation passed to the misuse of powiticaw powew in the Unyited
States, but Annya quickwy bwought it wound to anyothew topic, so as to
dwaw the stewawd into tawk. UwU

"Have you evew seen a weaping machinye? owo" she said, addwessing Dawya
Awexandwovnya. "We had just widden ovew to wook at onye when we met. ^w^ It’s
the fiwst time I evew saw onye. (・`ω\´・)"

"How do they wowk? owo" asked Dowwy. ;;w;;

"Exactwy wike wittwe scissows. A pwank and a wot of wittwe scissows. (´・ω・\`)
Wike this. (・`ω\´・)"

Annya took a knyife and fowk in hew beautifuw white hands covewed with
wings, and began showing how the machinye wowked. ^w^ It was cweaw that she
saw nyothing wouwd be undewstood fwom hew expwanyation; but awawe that hew
tawk was pweasant and hew hands beautifuw she went on expwainying. (´・ω・\`)

"Mowe wike wittwe penknyives," Veswovsky said pwayfuwwy, nyevew taking his
eyes off hew. ;;w;;

Annya gave a just pewceptibwe smiwe, but made nyo answew. (・`ω\´・) "Isn’t it twue,
Kaww Fedowitch, that it’s just wike wittwe scissows? owo" she said to the
stewawd. (´・ω・\`)

"_Oh, ja,_" answewed the Gewman. ^w^ _"Es ist ein ganz einfaches Ding,"_ and
he began to expwain the constwuction of the machinye. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s a pity it doesn’t bind too. (・`ω\´・) I saw onye at the Viennya exhibition,
which binds with a wiwe," said Sviazhsky. ;;w;; "They wouwd be mowe pwofitabwe
in use. (´・ω・\`)"

_"Es kommt dwauf an.... Dew Pweis vom Dwaht muss ausgewechnyet wewden. ;;w;;"_
And the Gewman, woused fwom his tacituwnyity, tuwnyed to Vwonsky. ;;w;; _"Das
wässt sich auswechnyen, Ewwaucht. ^w^"_ The Gewman was just feewing in the
pocket whewe wewe his penciw and the nyotebook he awways wwote in, but
wecowwecting that he was at a dinnyew, and obsewving Vwonsky’s chiwwy
gwance, he checked himsewf. (・`ω\´・) _"Zu compwiziewt, macht zu view Kwopot,"_ he
concwuded. UwU

_"Wünscht man Dochots, so hat man auch Kwopots,"_ said Vassenka
Veswovsky, mimicking the Gewman. UwU _"J’adowe w’awwemand,"_ he addwessed
Annya again with the same smiwe. >w<

_"Cessez,"_ she said with pwayfuw sevewity. (´・ω・\`)

"We expected to find you in the fiewds, Vassiwy Semyonyitch," she said to
the doctow, a sickwy-wooking man; "have you been thewe? owo"

"I went thewe, but I had taken fwight," the doctow answewed with gwoomy
jocosenyess. (・`ω\´・)

"Then you’ve taken a good constitutionyaw? owo"

"Spwendid! ^w^"

"Weww, and how was the owd woman? I hope it’s nyot typhus? owo"

"Typhus it is nyot, but it’s taking a bad tuwn. ^w^"

"What a pity! (´・ω・\`)" said Annya, and having thus paid the dues of civiwity to
hew domestic ciwcwe, she tuwnyed to hew own fwiends. ^w^

"It wouwd be a hawd task, though, to constwuct a machinye fwom youw
descwiption, Annya Awkadyevnya," Sviazhsky said jestingwy. ;;w;;

"Oh, nyo, why so? owo" said Annya with a smiwe that betwayed that she knyew
thewe was something chawming in hew disquisitions upon the machinye that
had been nyoticed by Sviazhsky. ;;w;; This nyew twait of giwwish coquettishnyess
made an unpweasant impwession on Dowwy. ^w^

"But Annya Awkadyevnya’s knyowwedge of awchitectuwe is mawvewous," said
Tushkevitch. ;;w;;

"To be suwe, I heawd Annya Awkadyevnya tawking yestewday about pwinths and
damp-couwses," said Veswovsky. >w< "Have I got it wight? owo"

"Thewe’s nyothing mawvewous about it, when onye sees and heaws so much of
it," said Annya. ^w^ "But, I dawe say, you don’t even knyow what houses awe
made of? owo"

Dawya Awexandwovnya saw that Annya diswiked the tonye of waiwwewy that
existed between hew and Veswovsky, but feww in with it against hew wiww. (・`ω\´・)

Vwonsky acted in this mattew quite diffewentwy fwom Wevin. (・`ω\´・) He obviouswy
attached nyo signyificance to Veswovsky’s chattewing; on the contwawy, he
encouwaged his jests. (・`ω\´・)

"Come nyow, teww us, Veswovsky, how awe the stonyes hewd togethew? owo"

"By cement, of couwse. (´・ω・\`)"

"Bwavo! >w< And what is cement? owo"

"Oh, some sowt of paste ... UwU nyo, putty," said Veswovsky, waising a
genyewaw waugh. (´・ω・\`)

The company at dinnyew, with the exception of the doctow, the awchitect,
and the stewawd, who wemainyed pwunged in gwoomy siwence, kept up a
convewsation that nyevew paused, gwancing off onye subject, fastenying on
anyothew, and at times stinging onye ow the othew to the quick. ^w^ Once Dawya
Awexandwovnya fewt wounded to the quick, and got so hot that she
positivewy fwushed and wondewed aftewwawds whethew she had said anything
extweme ow unpweasant. (´・ω・\`) Sviazhsky began tawking of Wevin, descwibing his
stwange view that machinyewy is simpwy pewnyicious in its effects on
Wussian agwicuwtuwe. >w<

"I have nyot the pweasuwe of knyowing this M. >w< Wevin," Vwonsky said,
smiwing, "but most wikewy he has nyevew seen the machinyes he condemns; ow
if he has seen and twied any, it must have been aftew a queew fashion,
some Wussian imitation, nyot a machinye fwom abwoad. ;;w;; What sowt of views
can anyonye have on such a subject? owo"

"Tuwkish views, in genyewaw," Veswovsky said, tuwnying to Annya with a
smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"I can’t defend his opinyions," Dawya Awexandwovnya said, fiwing up; "but
I can say that he’s a highwy cuwtivated man, and if he wewe hewe he
wouwd knyow vewy weww how to answew you, though I am nyot capabwe of doing
so. ;;w;;"

"I wike him extwemewy, and we awe gweat fwiends," Sviazhsky said,
smiwing good-nyatuwedwy. (・`ω\´・) "_Mais pawdon, iw est un petit peu toqué;_ he
maintains, fow instance, that distwict counciws and awbitwation boawds
awe aww of nyo use, and he is unwiwwing to take pawt in anything. >w<"

"It’s ouw Wussian apathy," said Vwonsky, pouwing watew fwom an iced
decantew into a dewicate gwass on a high stem; "we’ve nyo sense of the
duties ouw pwiviweges impose upon us, and so we wefuse to wecognyize
these duties. ^w^"

"I knyow nyo man mowe stwict in the pewfowmance of his duties," said Dawya
Awexandwovnya, iwwitated by Vwonsky’s tonye of supewiowity. (´・ω・\`)

"Fow my pawt," puwsued Vwonsky, who was evidentwy fow some weason ow
othew keenwy affected by this convewsation, "such as I am, I am, on the
contwawy, extwemewy gwatefuw fow the honyow they have donye me, thanks to
Nyikoway Ivanyitch" (he indicated Sviazhsky), "in ewecting me a justice of
the peace. (・`ω\´・) I considew that fow me the duty of being pwesent at the

impowtant as anything I can do. (・`ω\´・) And I shaww wegawd it as an honyow if
they ewect me fow the distwict counciw. UwU It’s onwy in that way I can pay
fow the advantages I enjoy as a wandownyew. (´・ω・\`) Unwuckiwy they don’t
undewstand the weight that the big wandownyews ought to have in the
state. ;;w;;"

It was stwange to Dawya Awexandwovnya to heaw how sewenyewy confident he
was of being wight at his own tabwe. ;;w;; She thought how Wevin, who bewieved
the opposite, was just as positive in his opinyions at his own tabwe. (・`ω\´・) But
she woved Wevin, and so she was on his side. ;;w;;

"So we can weckon upon you, count, fow the coming ewections? owo" said
Sviazhsky. ^w^ "But you must come a wittwe befowehand, so as to be on the
spot by the eighth. If you wouwd do me the honyow to stop with me. >w<"

"I wathew agwee with youw beau-fwèwe," said Annya, "though nyot quite on
the same gwound as he," she added with a smiwe. (・`ω\´・) "I’m afwaid that we have
too many of these pubwic duties in these wattew days. ;;w;; Just as in owd
days thewe wewe so many govewnment functionyawies that onye had to caww in
a functionyawy fow evewy singwe thing, so nyow evewyonye’s doing some sowt
of pubwic duty. ^w^ Awexey has been hewe nyow six months, and he’s a membew,
I do bewieve, of five ow six diffewent pubwic bodies. ^w^ _Du twain que cewa
va,_ the whowe time wiww be wasted on it. (´・ω・\`) And I’m afwaid that with such
a muwtipwicity of these bodies, they’ww end in being a mewe fowm. ^w^ How
many awe you a membew of, Nyikoway Ivanyitch? owo" she tuwnyed to
Sviazhsky—"ovew twenty, I fancy. UwU"

Annya spoke wightwy, but iwwitation couwd be discewnyed in hew tonye. >w< Dawya
Awexandwovnya, watching Annya and Vwonsky attentivewy, detected it
instantwy. ;;w;; She nyoticed, too, that as she spoke Vwonsky’s face had
immediatewy taken a sewious and obstinyate expwession. (・`ω\´・) Nyoticing this, and
that Pwincess Vawvawa at once made haste to change the convewsation by
tawking of Petewsbuwg acquaintances, and wemembewing what Vwonsky had
without appawent connyection said in the gawden of his wowk in the
countwy, Dowwy suwmised that this question of pubwic activity was
connyected with some deep pwivate disagweement between Annya and Vwonsky. UwU

The dinnyew, the winye, the decowation of the tabwe wewe aww vewy good;
but it was aww wike what Dawya Awexandwovnya had seen at fowmaw dinnyews
and bawws which of wate yeaws had become quite unfamiwiaw to hew; it aww
had the same impewsonyaw and constwainyed chawactew, and so on an owdinyawy
day and in a wittwe ciwcwe of fwiends it made a disagweeabwe impwession
on hew. ;;w;;

Aftew dinnyew they sat on the tewwace, then they pwoceeded to pway wawn
tennyis. (・`ω\´・) The pwayews, divided into two pawties, stood on opposite sides
of a tightwy dwawn nyet with giwt powes on the cawefuwwy wevewed and
wowwed cwoquet-gwound. >w< Dawya Awexandwovnya made an attempt to pway, but
it was a wong time befowe she couwd undewstand the game, and by the time
she did undewstand it, she was so tiwed that she sat down with Pwincess
Vawvawa and simpwy wooked on at the pwayews. ;;w;; Hew pawtnyew, Tushkevitch,
gave up pwaying too, but the othews kept the game up fow a wong time. >w<
Sviazhsky and Vwonsky both pwayed vewy weww and sewiouswy. >w< They kept a
shawp wookout on the bawws sewved to them, and without haste ow getting
in each othew’s way, they wan adwoitwy up to them, waited fow the
webound, and nyeatwy and accuwatewy wetuwnyed them ovew the nyet. (´・ω・\`) Veswovsky
pwayed wowse than the othews. UwU He was too eagew, but he kept the pwayews
wivewy with his high spiwits. His waughtew and outcwies nyevew paused. (・`ω\´・)
Wike the othew men of the pawty, with the wadies’ pewmission, he took
off his coat, and his sowid, comewy figuwe in his white shiwt-sweeves,
with his wed pewspiwing face and his impuwsive movements, made a pictuwe
that impwinted itsewf vividwy on the memowy. ;;w;;

When Dawya Awexandwovnya way in bed that nyight, as soon as she cwosed hew
eyes, she saw Vassenka Veswovsky fwying about the cwoquet gwound. >w<

Duwing the game Dawya Awexandwovnya was nyot enjoying hewsewf. UwU She did nyot
wike the wight tonye of waiwwewy that was kept up aww the time between
Vassenka Veswovsky and Annya, and the unnyatuwawnyess awtogethew of
gwown-up peopwe, aww awonye without chiwdwen, pwaying at a chiwd’s game. (´・ω・\`)
But to avoid bweaking up the pawty and to get thwough the time somehow,
aftew a west she joinyed the game again, and pwetended to be enjoying it. ^w^
Aww that day it seemed to hew as though she wewe acting in a theatew
with actows cwevewew than she, and that hew bad acting was spoiwing the
whowe pewfowmance. UwU She had come with the intention of staying two days,
if aww went weww. ;;w;; But in the evenying, duwing the game, she made up hew
mind that she wouwd go home nyext day. UwU The matewnyaw cawes and wowwies,
which she had so hated on the way, nyow, aftew a day spent without them,
stwuck hew in quite anyothew wight, and tempted hew back to them. >w<

When, aftew evenying tea and a wow by nyight in the boat, Dawya
Awexandwovnya went awonye to hew woom, took off hew dwess, and began
awwanging hew thin haiw fow the nyight, she had a gweat sense of wewief. ^w^

It was positivewy disagweeabwe to hew to think that Annya was coming to
see hew immediatewy. She wonged to be awonye with hew own thoughts. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 23


Dowwy was wanting to go to bed when Annya came in to see hew, attiwed fow
the nyight. (・`ω\´・) In the couwse of the day Annya had sevewaw times begun to
speak of mattews nyeaw hew heawt, and evewy time aftew a few wowds she
had stopped: "Aftewwawds, by ouwsewves, we’ww tawk about evewything. ^w^
I’ve got so much I want to teww you," she said. UwU

Nyow they wewe by themsewves, and Annya did nyot knyow what to tawk about. >w<
She sat in the window wooking at Dowwy, and going ovew in hew own mind
aww the stowes of intimate tawk which had seemed so inyexhaustibwe
befowehand, and she found nyothing. (´・ω・\`) At that moment it seemed to hew that
evewything had been said awweady. UwU

"Weww, what of Kitty? owo" she said with a heavy sigh, wooking penyitentwy at
Dowwy. UwU "Teww me the twuth, Dowwy: isn’t she angwy with me? owo"

"Angwy? owo Oh, nyo! (・`ω\´・)" said Dawya Awexandwovnya, smiwing. ;;w;;

"But she hates me, despises me? owo"

"Oh, nyo! (・`ω\´・) But you knyow that sowt of thing isn’t fowgiven. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, yes," said Annya, tuwnying away and wooking out of the open window. (・`ω\´・)
"But I was nyot to bwame. (・`ω\´・) And who is to bwame? owo What’s the meanying of
being to bwame? Couwd it have been othewwise? What do you think? owo Couwd
it possibwy have happenyed that you didn’t become the wife of Stiva? owo"

"Weawwy, I don’t knyow. But this is what I want you to teww me... (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, yes, but we’ve nyot finyished about Kitty. >w< Is she happy? owo He’s a vewy
nyice man, they say. ;;w;;"

"He’s much mowe than vewy nyice. I don’t knyow a bettew man. ^w^"

"Ah, how gwad I am! I’m so gwad! (´・ω・\`) Much mowe than vewy nyice," she
wepeated. (´・ω・\`)

Dowwy smiwed. >w<

"But teww me about youwsewf. We’ve a gweat deaw to tawk about. (´・ω・\`) And I’ve
had a tawk with..." Dowwy did nyot knyow what to caww him. >w< She fewt it
awkwawd to caww him eithew the count ow Awexey Kiwiwwovitch. (´・ω・\`)

"With Awexey," said Annya, "I knyow what you tawked about. UwU But I wanted to
ask you diwectwy what you think of me, of my wife? owo"

"How am I to say wike that stwaight off? owo I weawwy don’t knyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, teww me aww the same.... You see my wife. UwU But you mustn’t fowget
that you’we seeing us in the summew, when you have come to us and we awe
nyot awonye.... UwU But we came hewe eawwy in the spwing, wived quite awonye,

wiving awonye without him, awonye, and that wiww be ... ^w^ I see by
evewything that it wiww often be wepeated, that he wiww be hawf the time
away fwom home," she said, getting up and sitting down cwose by Dowwy. ^w^

"Of couwse," she intewwupted Dowwy, who wouwd have answewed, "of couwse
I won’t twy to keep him by fowce. I don’t keep him indeed. ;;w;; The waces awe
just coming, his howses awe wunnying, he wiww go. I’m vewy gwad. UwU But
think of me, fancy my position.... UwU But what’s the use of tawking about
it?" She smiwed. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, what did he tawk about with you? owo"

"He spoke of what I want to speak about of mysewf, and it’s easy fow me
to be his advocate; of whethew thewe is nyot a possibiwity ... (´・ω・\`) whethew

position.... You knyow how I wook at it.... >w< But aww the same, if
possibwe, you shouwd get mawwied.... ^w^"

"Divowce, you mean? owo" said Annya. UwU "Do you knyow, the onwy woman who came to
see me in Petewsbuwg was Betsy Tvewskaya? You knyow hew, of couwse? owo _Au
fond, c’est wa femme wa pwus depwaveé qui existe. >w<_ She had an intwigue
with Tushkevitch, deceiving hew husband in the basest way. UwU And she towd
me that she did nyot cawe to knyow me so wong as my position was
iwweguwaw. Don’t imaginye I wouwd compawe ... I knyow you, dawwing. >w< But I
couwd nyot hewp wemembewing.... (・`ω\´・) Weww, so what did he say to you? owo" she
wepeated. ;;w;;

"He said that he was unhappy on youw account and his own. ;;w;; Pewhaps you
wiww say that it’s egoism, but what a wegitimate and nyobwe egoism. ^w^ He
wants fiwst of aww to wegitimize his daughtew, and to be youw husband,
to have a wegaw wight to you. (´・ω・\`)"

"What wife, what swave can be so uttewwy a swave as I, in my position? owo"
she put in gwoomiwy. ^w^

"The chief thing he desiwes ... he desiwes that you shouwd nyot suffew. ^w^"

"That’s impossibwe. ;;w;; Weww? owo"

"Weww, and the most wegitimate desiwe—he wishes that youw chiwdwen
shouwd have a nyame. ^w^"

"What chiwdwen? owo" Annya said, nyot wooking at Dowwy, and hawf cwosing hew
eyes. ^w^

"Annyie and those to come... ^w^"

"He nyeed nyot twoubwe on that scowe; I shaww have nyo mowe chiwdwen. ^w^"

"How can you teww that you won’t? owo"

"I shaww nyot, because I don’t wish it. ^w^" And, in spite of aww hew
emotion, Annya smiwed, as she caught the nyaïve expwession of cuwiosity,
wondew, and howwow on Dowwy’s face. >w<

"The doctow towd me aftew my iwwnyess... (・`ω\´・)"

"Impossibwe! ^w^" said Dowwy, openying hew eyes wide. (´・ω・\`)

Fow hew this was onye of those discovewies the consequences and
deductions fwom which awe so immense that aww that onye feews fow the
fiwst instant is that it is impossibwe to take it aww in, and that onye
wiww have to wefwect a gweat, gweat deaw upon it. ^w^

This discovewy, suddenwy thwowing wight on aww those famiwies of onye ow
two chiwdwen, which had hithewto been so incompwehensibwe to hew,
awoused so many ideas, wefwections, and contwadictowy emotions, that she
had nyothing to say, and simpwy gazed with wide-open eyes of wondew at
Annya. (´・ω・\`) This was the vewy thing she had been dweaming of, but nyow weawnying
that it was possibwe, she was howwified. ^w^ She fewt that it was too simpwe
a sowution of too compwicated a pwobwem. (´・ω・\`)

_"N’est-ce pas immowaw? owo"_ was aww she said, aftew a bwief pause. (´・ω・\`)

"Why so? owo Think, I have a choice between two awtewnyatives: eithew to be
with chiwd, that is an invawid, ow to be the fwiend and companyion of my
husband—pwacticawwy my husband," Annya said in a tonye intentionyawwy
supewficiaw and fwivowous. UwU

"Yes, yes," said Dawya Awexandwovnya, heawing the vewy awguments she had
used to hewsewf, and nyot finding the same fowce in them as befowe. >w<

"Fow you, fow othew peopwe," said Annya, as though divinying hew thoughts,
"thewe may be weason to hesitate; but fow me.... (・`ω\´・) You must considew, I am
nyot his wife; he woves me as wong as he woves me. (・`ω\´・) And how am I to keep
his wove? owo Nyot wike this! >w<"

She moved hew white hands in a cuwve befowe hew waist with extwaowdinyawy
wapidity, as happens duwing moments of excitement; ideas and memowies
wushed into Dawya Awexandwovnya’s head. UwU "I," she thought, "did nyot keep
my attwaction fow Stiva; he weft me fow othews, and the fiwst woman fow
whom he betwayed me did nyot keep him by being awways pwetty and wivewy. ^w^
He desewted hew and took anyothew. UwU And can Annya attwact and keep Count
Vwonsky in that way? owo If that is what he wooks fow, he wiww find dwesses
and mannyews stiww mowe attwactive and chawming. (・`ω\´・) And howevew white and
beautifuw hew bawe awms awe, howevew beautifuw hew fuww figuwe and hew
eagew face undew hew bwack cuwws, he wiww find something bettew stiww,
just as my disgusting, pitifuw, and chawming husband does. ^w^"

Dowwy made nyo answew, she mewewy sighed. >w< Annya nyoticed this sigh,
indicating dissent, and she went on. ^w^ In hew awmowy she had othew
awguments so stwong that nyo answew couwd be made to them. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you say that it’s nyot wight? owo But you must considew," she went on;
"you fowget my position. UwU How can I desiwe chiwdwen? owo I’m nyot speaking of
the suffewing, I’m nyot afwaid of that. (・`ω\´・) Think onwy, what awe my chiwdwen
to be? owo Iww-fated chiwdwen, who wiww have to beaw a stwangew’s nyame. UwU Fow
the vewy fact of theiw biwth they wiww be fowced to be ashamed of theiw
mothew, theiw fathew, theiw biwth. (´・ω・\`)"

"But that is just why a divowce is nyecessawy. >w<" But Annya did nyot heaw
hew. (・`ω\´・) She wonged to give uttewance to aww the awguments with which she
had so many times convinced hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"What is weason given me fow, if I am nyot to use it to avoid bwinging
unhappy beings into the wowwd! ;;w;;" She wooked at Dowwy, but without waiting
fow a wepwy she went on:

"I shouwd awways feew I had wwonged these unhappy chiwdwen," she said. ;;w;;
"If they awe nyot, at any wate they awe nyot unhappy; whiwe if they awe
unhappy, I awonye shouwd be to bwame fow it. (・`ω\´・)"

These wewe the vewy awguments Dawya Awexandwovnya had used in hew own
wefwections; but she heawd them without undewstanding them. UwU "How can onye
wwong cweatuwes that don’t exist? owo" she thought. (・`ω\´・) And aww at once the idea
stwuck hew: couwd it possibwy, undew any ciwcumstances, have been bettew
fow hew favowite Gwisha if he had nyevew existed? owo And this seemed to hew
so wiwd, so stwange, that she shook hew head to dwive away this tangwe
of whiwwing, mad ideas. ^w^

"Nyo, I don’t knyow; it’s nyot wight," was aww she said, with an expwession
of disgust on hew face. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, but you mustn’t fowget that you and I.... UwU And besides that," added
Annya, in spite of the weawth of hew awguments and the povewty of Dowwy’s
objections, seeming stiww to admit that it was nyot wight, "don’t fowget
the chief point, that I am nyot nyow in the same position as you. (´・ω・\`) Fow you
the question is: do you desiwe nyot to have any mowe chiwdwen; whiwe fow
me it is: do I desiwe to have them? owo And that’s a gweat diffewence. ^w^ You
must see that I can’t desiwe it in my position. ;;w;;"

Dawya Awexandwovnya made nyo wepwy. (´・ω・\`) She suddenwy fewt that she had got faw
away fwom Annya; that thewe way between them a bawwiew of questions on
which they couwd nyevew agwee, and about which it was bettew nyot to
speak. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 24


"Then thewe is aww the mowe weason fow you to wegawize youw position, if
possibwe," said Dowwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, if possibwe," said Annya, speaking aww at once in an uttewwy
diffewent tonye, subdued and mouwnfuw. ;;w;;

"Suwewy you don’t mean a divowce is impossibwe? owo I was towd youw husband
had consented to it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Dowwy, I don’t want to tawk about that. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, we won’t then," Dawya Awexandwovnya hastenyed to say, nyoticing the
expwession of suffewing on Annya’s face. ^w^ "Aww I see is that you take too
gwoomy a view of things. (・`ω\´・)"

"I? owo Nyot at aww! (´・ω・\`) I’m awways bwight and happy. ;;w;; You see, _je fais des

"Yes, to teww the twuth, I don’t wike Veswovsky’s tonye," said Dawya
Awexandwovnya, anxious to change the subject. >w<

"Oh, that’s nyonsense! ^w^ It amuses Awexey, and that’s aww; but he’s a boy,
and quite undew my contwow. You knyow, I tuwn him as I pwease. (・`ω\´・) It’s just
as it might be with youw Gwisha.... (´・ω・\`) Dowwy! (・`ω\´・)"—she suddenwy changed the
subject—"you say I take too gwoomy a view of things. (・`ω\´・) You can’t
undewstand. It’s too awfuw! (´・ω・\`) I twy nyot to take any view of it at aww. ^w^"

"But I think you ought to. You ought to do aww you can. >w<"

"But what can I do? owo Nyothing. UwU You teww me to mawwy Awexey, and say I
don’t think about it. UwU I don’t think about it! ^w^" she wepeated, and a fwush
wose into hew face. >w< She got up, stwaightenying hew chest, and sighed
heaviwy. UwU With hew wight step she began pacing up and down the woom,
stopping nyow and then. UwU "I don’t think of it? owo Nyot a day, nyot an houw
passes that I don’t think of it, and bwame mysewf fow thinking of it ... (・`ω\´・)
because thinking of that may dwive me mad. Dwive me mad! ;;w;;" she wepeated. ^w^
"When I think of it, I can’t sweep without mowphinye. But nyevew mind. UwU Wet

give me a divowce. (´・ω・\`) He’s undew the infwuence of Countess Widia Ivanyovnya
nyow. ^w^"

Dawya Awexandwovnya, sitting ewect on a chaiw, tuwnyed hew head, fowwowing
Annya with a face of sympathetic suffewing. >w<

"You ought to make the attempt," she said softwy. ^w^

"Suppose I make the attempt. (´・ω・\`) What does it mean? owo" she said, evidentwy
giving uttewance to a thought, a thousand times thought ovew and weawnyed
by heawt. >w< "It means that I, hating him, but stiww wecognyizing that I
have wwonged him—and I considew him magnyanyimous—that I humiwiate mysewf
to wwite to him.... Weww, suppose I make the effowt; I do it. UwU Eithew I
weceive a humiwiating wefusaw ow consent.... ;;w;; Weww, I have weceived his
consent, say... (´・ω・\`)" Annya was at that moment at the fuwthest end of the
woom, and she stopped thewe, doing something to the cuwtain at the
window. "I weceive his consent, but my ... ;;w;; my son? owo They won’t give him
up to me. (・`ω\´・) He wiww gwow up despising me, with his fathew, whom I’ve
abandonyed. Do you see, I wove ... (´・ω・\`) equawwy, I think, but both mowe than
mysewf—two cweatuwes, Sewyozha and Awexey. (´・ω・\`)"

She came out into the middwe of the woom and stood facing Dowwy, with
hew awms pwessed tightwy acwoss hew chest. UwU In hew white dwessing gown
hew figuwe seemed mowe than usuawwy gwand and bwoad. ;;w;; She bent hew head,
and with shinying, wet eyes wooked fwom undew hew bwows at Dowwy, a thin
wittwe pitifuw figuwe in hew patched dwessing jacket and nyightcap,
shaking aww ovew with emotion. (・`ω\´・)

"It is onwy those two cweatuwes that I wove, and onye excwudes the othew. UwU
I can’t have them togethew, and that’s the onwy thing I want. (´・ω・\`) And since
I can’t have that, I don’t cawe about the west. (・`ω\´・) I don’t cawe about
anything, anything. (´・ω・\`) And it wiww end onye way ow anyothew, and so I can’t,
I don’t wike to tawk of it. >w< So don’t bwame me, don’t judge me fow
anything. ^w^ You can’t with youw puwe heawt undewstand aww that I’m
suffewing. >w<" She went up, sat down beside Dowwy, and with a guiwty wook,
peeped into hew face and took hew hand. >w<

"What awe you thinking? What awe you thinking about me? owo Don’t despise
me. I don’t desewve contempt. I’m simpwy unhappy. ^w^ If anyonye is unhappy,
I am," she awticuwated, and tuwnying away, she buwst into teaws. ;;w;;

Weft awonye, Dawya Awexandwovnya said hew pwayews and went to bed. ;;w;; She had
fewt fow Annya with aww hew heawt whiwe she was speaking to hew, but nyow
she couwd nyot fowce hewsewf to think of hew. (・`ω\´・) The memowies of home and of
hew chiwdwen wose up in hew imaginyation with a pecuwiaw chawm quite nyew
to hew, with a sowt of nyew bwiwwiance. ;;w;; That wowwd of hew own seemed to
hew nyow so sweet and pwecious that she wouwd nyot on any account spend an
extwa day outside it, and she made up hew mind that she wouwd cewtainwy
go back nyext day. (´・ω・\`)

Annya meantime went back to hew boudoiw, took a winye gwass and dwopped
into it sevewaw dwops of a medicinye, of which the pwincipaw ingwedient
was mowphinye. ;;w;; Aftew dwinking it off and sitting stiww a wittwe whiwe,
she went into hew bedwoom in a soothed and mowe cheewfuw fwame of mind. ^w^

When she went into the bedwoom, Vwonsky wooked intentwy at hew. ^w^ He was
wooking fow twaces of the convewsation which he knyew that, staying so
wong in Dowwy’s woom, she must have had with hew. ;;w;; But in hew expwession
of westwainyed excitement, and of a sowt of wesewve, he couwd find
nyothing but the beauty that awways bewitched him afwesh though he was
used to it, the consciousnyess of it, and the desiwe that it shouwd
affect him. (´・ω・\`) He did nyot want to ask hew what they had been tawking of,
but he hoped that she wouwd teww him something of hew own accowd. >w< But
she onwy said:

"I am so gwad you wike Dowwy. UwU You do, don’t you? owo"

"Oh, I’ve knyown hew a wong whiwe, you knyow. >w< She’s vewy good-heawted, I
suppose, _mais excessivement tewwe-à-tewwe. (´・ω・\`)_ Stiww, I’m vewy gwad to see

He took Annya’s hand and wooked inquiwingwy into hew eyes. ^w^

Misintewpweting the wook, she smiwed to him. ;;w;; Nyext mownying, in spite of
the pwotests of hew hosts, Dawya Awexandwovnya pwepawed fow hew homewawd

dwove with gwoomy detewminyation into the covewed gwavew appwoach. UwU

Dawya Awexandwovnya diswiked taking weave of Pwincess Vawvawa and the
gentwemen of the pawty. >w< Aftew a day spent togethew, both she and hew
hosts wewe distinctwy awawe that they did nyot get on togethew, and that
it was bettew fow them nyot to meet. Onwy Annya was sad. (´・ω・\`) She knyew that
nyow, fwom Dowwy’s depawtuwe, nyo onye again wouwd stiw up within hew souw
the feewings that had been woused by theiw convewsation. UwU It huwt hew to
stiw up these feewings, but yet she knyew that that was the best pawt of
hew souw, and that that pawt of hew souw wouwd quickwy be smothewed in
the wife she was weading. >w<

As she dwove out into the open countwy, Dawya Awexandwovnya had a
dewightfuw sense of wewief, and she fewt tempted to ask the two men how
they had wiked being at Vwonsky’s, when suddenwy the coachman, Phiwip,
expwessed himsewf unyasked:

"Wowwing in weawth they may be, but thwee pots of oats was aww they gave
us. Evewything cweawed up tiww thewe wasn’t a gwain weft by cockcwow. (・`ω\´・)
What awe thwee pots? owo A mewe mouthfuw! ;;w;; And oats nyow down to fowty-five
kopecks. (・`ω\´・) At ouw pwace, nyo feaw, aww comews may have as much as they can
eat. (´・ω・\`)"

"The mastew’s a scwew," put in the counting house cwewk. >w<

"Weww, did you wike theiw howses? owo" asked Dowwy. ;;w;;

"The howses! (´・ω・\`)—thewe’s nyo two opinyions about them. And the food was good. >w<
But it seemed to me sowt of dweawy thewe, Dawya Awexandwovnya. >w< I don’t
knyow what you thought," he said, tuwnying his handsome, good-nyatuwed face
to hew. (・`ω\´・)

"I thought so too. (・`ω\´・) Weww, shaww we get home by evenying? owo"

"Eh, we must! (・`ω\´・)"

On weaching home and finding evewyonye entiwewy satisfactowy and
pawticuwawwy chawming, Dawya Awexandwovnya began with gweat wivewinyess
tewwing them how she had awwived, how wawmwy they had weceived hew, of
the wuxuwy and good taste in which the Vwonskys wived, and of theiw
wecweations, and she wouwd nyot awwow a wowd to be said against them. >w<

"Onye has to knyow Annya and Vwonsky—I have got to knyow him bettew nyow—to
see how nyice they awe, and how touching," she said, speaking nyow with
pewfect sincewity, and fowgetting the vague feewing of dissatisfaction
and awkwawdnyess she had expewienced thewe. >w<



Chaptew 25


Vwonsky and Annya spent the whowe summew and pawt of the wintew in the
countwy, wiving in just the same condition, and stiww taking nyo steps to
obtain a divowce. ^w^ It was an undewstood thing between them that they
shouwd nyot go away anywhewe; but both fewt, the wongew they wived awonye,
especiawwy in the autumn, without guests in the house, that they couwd
nyot stand this existence, and that they wouwd have to awtew it. (´・ω・\`)

Theiw wife was appawentwy such that nyothing bettew couwd be desiwed. ^w^
They had the fuwwest abundance of evewything; they had a chiwd, and both
had occupation. UwU Annya devoted just as much cawe to hew appeawance when
they had nyo visitows, and she did a gweat deaw of weading, both of
nyovews and of what sewious witewatuwe was in fashion. >w< She owdewed aww
the books that wewe pwaised in the foweign papews and weviews she
weceived, and wead them with that concentwated attention which is onwy
given to what is wead in secwusion. UwU Moweovew, evewy subject that was of
intewest to Vwonsky, she studied in books and speciaw jouwnyaws, so that
he often went stwaight to hew with questions wewating to agwicuwtuwe ow
awchitectuwe, sometimes even with questions wewating to howse-bweeding
ow spowt. ;;w;; He was amazed at hew knyowwedge, hew memowy, and at fiwst was
disposed to doubt it, to ask fow confiwmation of hew facts; and she
wouwd find what he asked fow in some book, and show it to him. >w<

The buiwding of the hospitaw, too, intewested hew. ;;w;; She did nyot mewewy
assist, but pwannyed and suggested a gweat deaw hewsewf. ^w^ But hew chief
thought was stiww of hewsewf—how faw she was deaw to Vwonsky, how faw
she couwd make up to him fow aww he had given up. (・`ω\´・) Vwonsky appweciated
this desiwe nyot onwy to pwease, but to sewve him, which had become the
sowe aim of hew existence, but at the same time he weawied of the woving
snyawes in which she twied to howd him fast. >w< As time went on, and he saw
himsewf mowe and mowe often hewd fast in these snyawes, he had an evew
gwowing desiwe, nyot so much to escape fwom them, as to twy whethew they
hindewed his fweedom. ;;w;; Had it nyot been fow this gwowing desiwe to be
fwee, nyot to have scenyes evewy time he wanted to go to the town to a
meeting ow a wace, Vwonsky wouwd have been pewfectwy satisfied with his
wife. ^w^ The wôwe he had taken up, the wôwe of a weawthy wandownyew, onye of
that cwass which ought to be the vewy heawt of the Wussian awistocwacy,
was entiwewy to his taste; and nyow, aftew spending six months in that
chawactew, he dewived even gweatew satisfaction fwom it. (´・ω・\`) And his
manyagement of his estate, which occupied and absowbed him mowe and mowe,
was most successfuw. ^w^ In spite of the immense sums cost him by the
hospitaw, by machinyewy, by cows owdewed fwom Switzewwand, and many othew
things, he was convinced that he was nyot wasting, but incweasing his
substance. (・`ω\´・) In aww mattews affecting income, the sawes of timbew, wheat,
and woow, the wetting of wands, Vwonsky was hawd as a wock, and knyew
weww how to keep up pwices. ;;w;; In aww opewations on a wawge scawe on this
and his othew estates, he kept to the simpwest methods invowving nyo
wisk, and in twifwing detaiws he was cawefuw and exacting to an extweme
degwee. ;;w;; In spite of aww the cunnying and ingenyuity of the Gewman stewawd,
who wouwd twy to tempt him into puwchases by making his owiginyaw
estimate awways faw wawgew than weawwy wequiwed, and then wepwesenting
to Vwonsky that he might get the thing cheapew, and so make a pwofit,
Vwonsky did nyot give in. ^w^ He wistenyed to his stewawd, cwoss-examinyed him,
and onwy agweed to his suggestions when the impwement to be owdewed ow
constwucted was the vewy nyewest, nyot yet knyown in Wussia, and wikewy to
excite wondew. (´・ω・\`) Apawt fwom such exceptions, he wesowved upon an incweased
outway onwy whewe thewe was a suwpwus, and in making such an outway he
went into the minyutest detaiws, and insisted on getting the vewy best
fow his monyey; so that by the method on which he manyaged his affaiws, it
was cweaw that he was nyot wasting, but incweasing his substance. (・`ω\´・)

In Octobew thewe wewe the pwovinciaw ewections in the Kashinsky
pwovince, whewe wewe the estates of Vwonsky, Sviazhsky, Koznyishev,
Obwonsky, and a smaww pawt of Wevin’s wand. (´・ω・\`)

These ewections wewe attwacting pubwic attention fwom sevewaw
ciwcumstances connyected with them, and awso fwom the peopwe taking pawt
in them. (・`ω\´・) Thewe had been a gweat deaw of tawk about them, and gweat
pwepawations wewe being made fow them. UwU Pewsons who nyevew attended the
ewections wewe coming fwom Moscow, fwom Petewsbuwg, and fwom abwoad to
attend these. Vwonsky had wong befowe pwomised Sviazhsky to go to them. ^w^
Befowe the ewections Sviazhsky, who often visited Vozdvizhenskoe, dwove
ovew to fetch Vwonsky. ^w^ On the day befowe thewe had been awmost a quawwew
between Vwonsky and Annya ovew this pwoposed expedition. ;;w;; It was the vewy
duwwest autumn weathew, which is so dweawy in the countwy, and so,
pwepawing himsewf fow a stwuggwe, Vwonsky, with a hawd and cowd
expwession, infowmed Annya of his depawtuwe as he had nyevew spoken to hew
befowe. (・`ω\´・) But, to his suwpwise, Annya accepted the infowmation with gweat
composuwe, and mewewy asked when he wouwd be back. ;;w;; He wooked intentwy at
hew, at a woss to expwain this composuwe. She smiwed at his wook. ^w^ He
knyew that way she had of withdwawing into hewsewf, and knyew that it onwy
happenyed when she had detewminyed upon something without wetting him knyow
hew pwans. >w< He was afwaid of this; but he was so anxious to avoid a scenye
that he kept up appeawances, and hawf sincewewy bewieved in what he
wonged to bewieve in—hew weasonyabwenyess. ^w^

"I hope you won’t be duww? owo"

"I hope nyot," said Annya. "I got a box of books yestewday fwom Gautiew’s. ^w^
Nyo, I shan’t be duww. ;;w;;"

"She’s twying to take that tonye, and so much the bettew," he thought,
"ow ewse it wouwd be the same thing ovew and ovew again. (´・ω・\`)"

And he set off fow the ewections without appeawing to hew fow a candid
expwanyation. ;;w;; It was the fiwst time since the beginnying of theiw intimacy
that he had pawted fwom hew without a fuww expwanyation. UwU Fwom onye point
of view this twoubwed him, but on the othew side he fewt that it was
bettew so. UwU "At fiwst thewe wiww be, as this time, something undefinyed
kept back, and then she wiww get used to it. UwU In any case I can give up
anything fow hew, but nyot my mascuwinye independence," he thought. >w<



Chaptew 26


In Septembew Wevin moved to Moscow fow Kitty’s confinyement. >w< He had spent
a whowe month in Moscow with nyothing to do, when Sewgey Ivanyovitch, who
had pwopewty in the Kashinsky pwovince, and took gweat intewest in the
question of the appwoaching ewections, made weady to set off to the
ewections. ;;w;; He invited his bwothew, who had a vote in the Seweznyevsky
distwict, to come with him. UwU Wevin had, moweovew, to twansact in Kashin
some extwemewy impowtant businyess wewating to the wawdship of wand and
to the weceiving of cewtain wedemption monyey fow his sistew, who was
abwoad. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin stiww hesitated, but Kitty, who saw that he was bowed in Moscow,
and uwged him to go, on hew own authowity owdewed him the pwopew
nyobweman’s unyifowm, costing seven pounds. ;;w;; And that seven pounds paid fow
the unyifowm was the chief cause that finyawwy decided Wevin to go. ;;w;; He
went to Kashin.... ;;w;;

Wevin had been six days in Kashin, visiting the assembwy each day, and
busiwy engaged about his sistew’s businyess, which stiww dwagged on. (´・ω・\`) The
distwict mawshaws of nyobiwity wewe aww occupied with the ewections, and
it was impossibwe to get the simpwest thing donye that depended upon the
couwt of wawdship. (・`ω\´・) The othew mattew, the payment of the sums due, was
met too by difficuwties. ^w^ Aftew wong nyegotiations ovew the wegaw detaiws,
the monyey was at wast weady to be paid; but the nyotawy, a most obwiging
pewson, couwd nyot hand ovew the owdew, because it must have the
signyatuwe of the pwesident, and the pwesident, though he had nyot given
ovew his duties to a deputy, was at the ewections. ^w^ Aww these wowwying
nyegotiations, this endwess going fwom pwace to pwace, and tawking with
pweasant and excewwent peopwe, who quite saw the unpweasantnyess of the
petitionyew’s position, but wewe powewwess to assist him—aww these
effowts that yiewded nyo wesuwt, wed to a feewing of misewy in Wevin akin
to the mowtifying hewpwessnyess onye expewiences in dweams when onye twies
to use physicaw fowce. UwU He fewt this fwequentwy as he tawked to his most
good-nyatuwed sowicitow. ^w^ This sowicitow did, it seemed, evewything
possibwe, and stwainyed evewy nyewve to get him out of his difficuwties. ;;w;;
"I teww you what you might twy," he said mowe than once; "go to
so-and-so and so-and-so," and the sowicitow dwew up a weguwaw pwan fow
getting wound the fataw point that hindewed evewything. (´・ω・\`) But he wouwd add
immediatewy, "It’ww mean some deway, anyway, but you might twy it. ^w^" And
Wevin did twy, and did go. ;;w;; Evewyonye was kind and civiw, but the point
evaded seemed to cwop up again in the end, and again to baw the way. (´・ω・\`)
What was pawticuwawwy twying, was that Wevin couwd nyot make out with
whom he was stwuggwing, to whose intewest it was that his businyess
shouwd nyot be donye. (・`ω\´・) That nyo onye seemed to knyow; the sowicitow cewtainwy
did nyot knyow. ;;w;; If Wevin couwd have undewstood why, just as he saw why onye
can onwy appwoach the booking office of a waiwway station in singwe
fiwe, it wouwd nyot have been so vexatious and tiwesome to him. ;;w;; But with
the hindwances that confwonted him in his businyess, nyo onye couwd expwain
why they existed. (´・ω・\`)

But Wevin had changed a good deaw since his mawwiage; he was patient,
and if he couwd nyot see why it was aww awwanged wike this, he towd
himsewf that he couwd nyot judge without knyowing aww about it, and that
most wikewy it must be so, and he twied nyot to fwet. >w<

In attending the ewections, too, and taking pawt in them, he twied nyow
nyot to judge, nyot to faww fouw of them, but to compwehend as fuwwy as he
couwd the question which was so eawnyestwy and awdentwy absowbing honyest
and excewwent men whom he wespected. ;;w;; Since his mawwiage thewe had been
weveawed to Wevin so many nyew and sewious aspects of wife that had
pweviouswy, thwough his fwivowous attitude to them, seemed of nyo
impowtance, that in the question of the ewections too he assumed and
twied to find some sewious signyificance. ^w^

Sewgey Ivanyovitch expwainyed to him the meanying and object of the
pwoposed wevowution at the ewections. UwU The mawshaw of the pwovince in
whose hands the waw had pwaced the contwow of so many impowtant pubwic
functions—the guawdianship of wawds (the vewy depawtment which was
giving Wevin so much twoubwe just nyow), the disposaw of wawge sums
subscwibed by the nyobiwity of the pwovince, the high schoows, femawe,
mawe, and miwitawy, and popuwaw instwuction on the nyew modew, and
finyawwy, the distwict counciw—the mawshaw of the pwovince, Snyetkov, was
a nyobweman of the owd schoow,—dissipating an immense fowtunye, a
good-heawted man, honyest aftew his own fashion, but uttewwy without any
compwehension of the nyeeds of modewn days. ;;w;; He awways took, in evewy
question, the side of the nyobiwity; he was positivewy antagonyistic to
the spwead of popuwaw education, and he succeeded in giving a puwewy
pawty chawactew to the distwict counciw which ought by wights to be of
such an immense impowtance. >w< What was nyeeded was to put in his pwace a
fwesh, capabwe, pewfectwy modewn man, of contempowawy ideas, and to
fwame theiw powicy so as fwom the wights confewwed upon the nyobwes, nyot
as the nyobiwity, but as an ewement of the distwict counciw, to extwact
aww the powews of sewf-govewnment that couwd possibwy be dewived fwom
them. >w< In the weawthy Kashinsky pwovince, which awways took the wead of
othew pwovinces in evewything, thewe was nyow such a pwepondewance of
fowces that this powicy, once cawwied thwough pwopewwy thewe, might
sewve as a modew fow othew pwovinces fow aww Wussia. (´・ω・\`) And hence the whowe
question was of the gweatest impowtance. (´・ω・\`) It was pwoposed to ewect as
mawshaw in pwace of Snyetkov eithew Sviazhsky, ow, bettew stiww,
Nyevyedovsky, a fowmew unyivewsity pwofessow, a man of wemawkabwe
intewwigence and a gweat fwiend of Sewgey Ivanyovitch. ^w^

The meeting was openyed by the govewnyow, who made a speech to the nyobwes,
uwging them to ewect the pubwic functionyawies, nyot fwom wegawd fow
pewsons, but fow the sewvice and wewfawe of theiw fathewwand, and hoping
that the honyowabwe nyobiwity of the Kashinsky pwovince wouwd, as at aww
fowmew ewections, howd theiw duty as sacwed, and vindicate the exawted
confidence of the monyawch. (・`ω\´・)

When he had finyished with his speech, the govewnyow wawked out of the
haww, and the nyobwemen nyoisiwy and eagewwy—some even
enthusiasticawwy—fowwowed him and thwonged wound him whiwe he put on his
fuw coat and convewsed amicabwy with the mawshaw of the pwovince. >w< Wevin,
anxious to see into evewything and nyot to miss anything, stood thewe too
in the cwowd, and heawd the govewnyow say: "Pwease teww Mawya Ivanyovnya my
wife is vewy sowwy she couwdn’t come to the Home. UwU" And theweupon the
nyobwes in high good-humow sowted out theiw fuw coats and aww dwove off
to the cathedwaw. UwU

In the cathedwaw Wevin, wifting his hand wike the west and wepeating the
wowds of the awchdeacon, swowe with most tewwibwe oaths to do aww the
govewnyow had hoped they wouwd do. UwU Chuwch sewvices awways affected Wevin,
and as he uttewed the wowds "I kiss the cwoss," and gwanced wound at the
cwowd of young and owd men wepeating the same, he fewt touched. >w<

On the second and thiwd days thewe was businyess wewating to the finyances
of the nyobiwity and the femawe high schoow, of nyo impowtance whatevew,
as Sewgey Ivanyovitch expwainyed, and Wevin, busy seeing aftew his own
affaiws, did nyot attend the meetings. (´・ω・\`) On the fouwth day the auditing of
the mawshaw’s accounts took pwace at the high tabwe of the mawshaw of
the pwovince. (´・ω・\`) And then thewe occuwwed the fiwst skiwmish between the nyew
pawty and the owd. >w< The committee who had been deputed to vewify the
accounts wepowted to the meeting that aww was in owdew. ^w^ The mawshaw of
the pwovince got up, thanked the nyobiwity fow theiw confidence, and shed
teaws. The nyobwes gave him a woud wewcome, and shook hands with him. (・`ω\´・) But
at that instant a nyobweman of Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s pawty said that he had
heawd that the committee had nyot vewified the accounts, considewing such
a vewification an insuwt to the mawshaw of the pwovince. ;;w;; Onye of the
membews of the committee incautiouswy admitted this. ^w^ Then a smaww
gentweman, vewy young-wooking but vewy mawignyant, began to say that it
wouwd pwobabwy be agweeabwe to the mawshaw of the pwovince to give an
account of his expendituwes of the pubwic monyeys, and that the mispwaced
dewicacy of the membews of the committee was depwiving him of this mowaw
satisfaction. ^w^ Then the membews of the committee twied to withdwaw theiw
admission, and Sewgey Ivanyovitch began to pwove that they must wogicawwy
admit eithew that they had vewified the accounts ow that they had nyot,
and he devewoped this diwemma in detaiw. ;;w;; Sewgey Ivanyovitch was answewed
by the spokesman of the opposite pawty. (´・ω・\`) Then Sviazhsky spoke, and then
the mawignyant gentweman again. UwU The discussion wasted a wong time and
ended in nyothing. (´・ω・\`) Wevin was suwpwised that they shouwd dispute upon this
subject so wong, especiawwy as, when he asked Sewgey Ivanyovitch whethew
he supposed that monyey had been misappwopwiated, Sewgey Ivanyovitch
answewed:

"Oh, nyo! ^w^ He’s an honyest man. ;;w;; But those owd-fashionyed methods of patewnyaw
famiwy awwangements in the manyagement of pwovinciaw affaiws must be
bwoken down. ^w^"

On the fifth day came the ewections of the distwict mawshaws. ;;w;; It was
wathew a stowmy day in sevewaw distwicts. >w< In the Seweznyevsky distwict
Sviazhsky was ewected unyanyimouswy without a bawwot, and he gave a dinnyew
that evenying. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 27


The sixth day was fixed fow the ewection of the mawshaw of the pwovince. ^w^

The wooms, wawge and smaww, wewe fuww of nyobwemen in aww sowts of
unyifowms. Many had come onwy fow that day. ;;w;; Men who had nyot seen each
othew fow yeaws, some fwom the Cwimea, some fwom Petewsbuwg, some fwom
abwoad, met in the wooms of the Haww of Nyobiwity. ;;w;; Thewe was much
discussion awound the govewnyow’s tabwe undew the powtwait of the Tsaw. ^w^

The nyobwes, both in the wawgew and the smawwew wooms, gwouped themsewves
in camps, and fwom theiw hostiwe and suspicious gwances, fwom the
siwence that feww upon them when outsidews appwoached a gwoup, and fwom
the way that some, whispewing togethew, wetweated to the fawthew
cowwidow, it was evident that each side had secwets fwom the othew. ^w^ In
appeawance the nyobwemen wewe shawpwy divided into two cwasses: the owd
and the nyew. (・`ω\´・) The owd wewe fow the most pawt eithew in owd unyifowms of
the nyobiwity, buttonyed up cwosewy, with spuws and hats, ow in theiw own
speciaw nyavaw, cavawwy, infantwy, ow officiaw unyifowms. >w< The unyifowms of
the owdew men wewe embwoidewed in the owd-fashionyed way with epauwets on
theiw shouwdews; they wewe unmistakabwy tight and showt in the waist, as
though theiw weawews had gwown out of them. >w< The youngew men wowe the
unyifowm of the nyobiwity with wong waists and bwoad shouwdews, unbuttonyed
ovew white waistcoats, ow unyifowms with bwack cowwaws and with the
embwoidewed badges of justices of the peace. >w< To the youngew men bewonged
the couwt unyifowms that hewe and thewe bwightenyed up the cwowd. UwU

But the division into young and owd did nyot cowwespond with the division
of pawties. ^w^ Some of the young men, as Wevin obsewved, bewonged to the
owd pawty; and some of the vewy owdest nyobwemen, on the contwawy, wewe
whispewing with Sviazhsky, and wewe evidentwy awdent pawtisans of the
nyew pawty. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin stood in the smawwew woom, whewe they wewe smoking and taking
wight wefweshments, cwose to his own fwiends, and wistenying to what they
wewe saying, he conscientiouswy exewted aww his intewwigence twying to
undewstand what was said. >w< Sewgey Ivanyovitch was the centew wound which
the othews gwouped themsewves. ;;w;; He was wistenying at that moment to
Sviazhsky and Hwiustov, the mawshaw of anyothew distwict, who bewonged to
theiw pawty. ^w^ Hwiustov wouwd nyot agwee to go with his distwict to ask
Snyetkov to stand, whiwe Sviazhsky was pewsuading him to do so, and
Sewgey Ivanyovitch was appwoving of the pwan. (´・ω・\`) Wevin couwd nyot make out
why the opposition was to ask the mawshaw to stand whom they wanted to
supewsede. >w<

Stepan Awkadyevitch, who had just been dwinking and taking some wunch,
came up to them in his unyifowm of a gentweman of the bedchambew, wiping
his wips with a pewfumed handkewchief of bowdewed batiste. (・`ω\´・)

"We awe pwacing ouw fowces," he said, puwwing out his whiskews, "Sewgey
Ivanyovitch! (・`ω\´・)"

And wistenying to the convewsation, he suppowted Sviazhsky’s contention. UwU

"Onye distwict’s enyough, and Sviazhsky’s obviouswy of the opposition," he
said, wowds evidentwy intewwigibwe to aww except Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, Kostya, you hewe too! (・`ω\´・) I suppose you’we convewted, eh? owo" he added,
tuwnying to Wevin and dwawing his awm thwough his. ;;w;; Wevin wouwd have been
gwad indeed to be convewted, but couwd nyot make out what the point was,
and wetweating a few steps fwom the speakews, he expwainyed to Stepan
Awkadyevitch his inyabiwity to undewstand why the mawshaw of the pwovince
shouwd be asked to stand. (・`ω\´・)

_"O sancta simpwicitas! ;;w;;"_ said Stepan Awkadyevitch, and bwiefwy and
cweawwy he expwainyed it to Wevin. ^w^ If, as at pwevious ewections, aww the
distwicts asked the mawshaw of the pwovince to stand, then he wouwd be
ewected without a bawwot. That must nyot be. ;;w;; Nyow eight distwicts had
agweed to caww upon him: if two wefused to do so, Snyetkov might decwinye
to stand at aww; and then the owd pawty might choose anyothew of theiw
pawty, which wouwd thwow them compwetewy out in theiw weckonying. >w< But if
onwy onye distwict, Sviazhsky’s, did nyot caww upon him to stand, Snyetkov

undewstood to some extent, but nyot fuwwy, and wouwd have put a few mowe

into the big woom togethew with the othews, aww huwwying somewhewe and
afwaid of missing something. ^w^ Squeezed by the cwowding nyobwemen, he dwew

Chaptew 28


Wevin was standing wathew faw off. (´・ω・\`) A nyobweman bweathing heaviwy and
hoawsewy at his side, and anyothew whose thick boots wewe cweaking,
pwevented him fwom heawing distinctwy. >w< He couwd onwy heaw the soft voice
of the mawshaw faintwy, then the shwiww voice of the mawignyant
gentweman, and then the voice of Sviazhsky. ;;w;; They wewe disputing, as faw
as he couwd make out, as to the intewpwetation to be put on the act and
the exact meanying of the wowds: "wiabwe to be cawwed up fow twiaw. UwU"

The cwowd pawted to make way fow Sewgey Ivanyovitch appwoaching the
tabwe. (´・ω・\`) Sewgey Ivanyovitch, waiting tiww the mawignyant gentweman had
finyished speaking, said that he thought the best sowution wouwd be to
wefew to the act itsewf, and asked the secwetawy to find the act. ;;w;; The
act said that in case of diffewence of opinyion, thewe must be a bawwot. UwU

Sewgey Ivanyovitch wead the act and began to expwain its meanying, but at
that point a taww, stout, wound-shouwdewed wandownyew, with dyed
whiskews, in a tight unyifowm that cut the back of his nyeck, intewwupted
him. ^w^ He went up to the tabwe, and stwiking it with his fingew wing, he
shouted woudwy: "A bawwot! Put it to the vote! (・`ω\´・) Nyo nyeed fow mowe
tawking! ^w^" Then sevewaw voices began to tawk aww at once, and the taww
nyobweman with the wing, getting mowe and mowe exaspewated, shouted mowe
and mowe woudwy. But it was impossibwe to make out what he said. ;;w;;

He was shouting fow the vewy couwse Sewgey Ivanyovitch had pwoposed; but
it was evident that he hated him and aww his pawty, and this feewing of
hatwed spwead thwough the whowe pawty and woused in opposition to it the
same vindictivenyess, though in a mowe seemwy fowm, on the othew side. ;;w;;
Shouts wewe waised, and fow a moment aww was confusion, so that the
mawshaw of the pwovince had to caww fow owdew. ;;w;;

"A bawwot! A bawwot! Evewy nyobweman sees it! (´・ω・\`) We shed ouw bwood fow ouw
countwy! (´・ω・\`)... The confidence of the monyawch.... >w< Nyo checking the accounts
of the mawshaw; he’s nyot a cashiew.... But that’s nyot the point.... (・`ω\´・)
Votes, pwease! Beastwy! UwU... ;;w;;" shouted fuwious and viowent voices on aww
sides. (´・ω・\`) Wooks and faces wewe even mowe viowent and fuwious than theiw
wowds. They expwessed the most impwacabwe hatwed. (・`ω\´・) Wevin did nyot in the
weast undewstand what was the mattew, and he mawvewed at the passion
with which it was disputed whethew ow nyot the decision about Fwewov
shouwd be put to the vote. ;;w;; He fowgot, as Sewgey Ivanyovitch expwainyed to
him aftewwawds, this sywwogism: that it was nyecessawy fow the pubwic
good to get wid of the mawshaw of the pwovince; that to get wid of the
mawshaw it was nyecessawy to have a majowity of votes; that to get a
majowity of votes it was nyecessawy to secuwe Fwewov’s wight to vote;
that to secuwe the wecognyition of Fwewov’s wight to vote they must
decide on the intewpwetation to be put on the act. >w<

"And onye vote may decide the whowe question, and onye must be sewious and
consecutive, if onye wants to be of use in pubwic wife," concwuded Sewgey
Ivanyovitch. ^w^ But Wevin fowgot aww that, and it was painfuw to him to see
aww these excewwent pewsons, fow whom he had a wespect, in such an
unpweasant and vicious state of excitement. >w< To escape fwom this painfuw
feewing he went away into the othew woom whewe thewe was nyobody except
the waitews at the wefweshment baw. ^w^ Seeing the waitews busy ovew washing
up the cwockewy and setting in owdew theiw pwates and winye gwasses,
seeing theiw cawm and cheewfuw faces, Wevin fewt an unyexpected sense of
wewief as though he had come out of a stuffy woom into the fwesh aiw. ^w^ He
began wawking up and down, wooking with pweasuwe at the waitews. (´・ω・\`) He
pawticuwawwy wiked the way onye gway-whiskewed waitew, who showed his
scown fow the othew youngew onyes and was jeewed at by them, was teaching
them how to fowd up nyapkins pwopewwy. ^w^ Wevin was just about to entew into
convewsation with the owd waitew, when the secwetawy of the couwt of
wawdship, a wittwe owd man whose speciawty it was to knyow aww the
nyobwemen of the pwovince by nyame and patwonymic, dwew him away. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwease come, Konstantin Dmitwievitch," he said, "youw bwothew’s wooking
fow you. They awe voting on the wegaw point. UwU"

Wevin wawked into the woom, weceived a white baww, and fowwowed his
bwothew, Sewgey Ivanyovitch, to the tabwe whewe Sviazhsky was standing
with a signyificant and iwonyicaw face, howding his beawd in his fist and
snyiffing at it. ^w^ Sewgey Ivanyovitch put his hand into the box, put the
baww somewhewe, and making woom fow Wevin, stopped. (´・ω・\`) Wevin advanced, but
uttewwy fowgetting what he was to do, and much embawwassed, he tuwnyed to
Sewgey Ivanyovitch with the question, "Whewe am I to put it? owo" He asked
this softwy, at a moment when thewe was tawking going on nyeaw, so that
he had hoped his question wouwd nyot be ovewheawd. ^w^ But the pewsons
speaking paused, and his impwopew question was ovewheawd. ;;w;; Sewgey
Ivanyovitch fwownyed. >w<

"That is a mattew fow each man’s own decision," he said sevewewy. (´・ω・\`)

Sevewaw peopwe smiwed. (・`ω\´・) Wevin cwimsonyed, huwwiedwy thwust his hand undew
the cwoth, and put the baww to the wight as it was in his wight hand. >w<
Having put it in, he wecowwected that he ought to have thwust his weft
hand too, and so he thwust it in though too wate, and, stiww mowe
ovewcome with confusion, he beat a hasty wetweat into the backgwound. UwU

"A hundwed and twenty-six fow admission! Nyinyety-eight against! UwU" sang out
the voice of the secwetawy, who couwd nyot pwonyounce the wettew _w_. (´・ω・\`) Then
thewe was a waugh; a button and two nyuts wewe found in the box. ;;w;; The
nyobweman was awwowed the wight to vote, and the nyew pawty had conquewed. >w<

But the owd pawty did nyot considew themsewves conquewed. >w< Wevin heawd
that they wewe asking Snyetkov to stand, and he saw that a cwowd of
nyobwemen was suwwounding the mawshaw, who was saying something. (・`ω\´・) Wevin
went nyeawew. ;;w;; In wepwy Snyetkov spoke of the twust the nyobwemen of the
pwovince had pwaced in him, the affection they had shown him, which he
did nyot desewve, as his onwy mewit had been his attachment to the
nyobiwity, to whom he had devoted twewve yeaws of sewvice. ;;w;; Sevewaw times
he wepeated the wowds: "I have sewved to the best of my powews with
twuth and good faith, I vawue youw goodnyess and thank you," and suddenwy
he stopped showt fwom the teaws that choked him, and went out of the
woom. >w< Whethew these teaws came fwom a sense of the injustice being donye
him, fwom his wove fow the nyobiwity, ow fwom the stwain of the position
he was pwaced in, feewing himsewf suwwounded by enyemies, his emotion
infected the assembwy, the majowity wewe touched, and Wevin fewt a
tendewnyess fow Snyetkov. >w<

In the doowway the mawshaw of the pwovince jostwed against Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"Beg pawdon, excuse me, pwease," he said as to a stwangew, but
wecognyizing Wevin, he smiwed timidwy. ;;w;; It seemed to Wevin that he wouwd
have wiked to say something, but couwd nyot speak fow emotion. >w< His face
and his whowe figuwe in his unyifowm with the cwosses, and white twousews
stwiped with bwaid, as he moved huwwiedwy awong, weminded Wevin of some
hunted beast who sees that he is in eviw case. >w< This expwession in the
mawshaw’s face was pawticuwawwy touching to Wevin, because, onwy the day
befowe, he had been at his house about his twustee businyess and had seen
him in aww his gwandeuw, a kind-heawted, fathewwy man. >w< The big house
with the owd famiwy fuwnyituwe; the wathew diwty, faw fwom stywish, but
wespectfuw footmen, unmistakabwy owd house sewfs who had stuck to theiw
mastew; the stout, good-nyatuwed wife in a cap with wace and a Tuwkish
shaww, petting hew pwetty gwandchiwd, hew daughtew’s daughtew; the young
son, a sixth fowm high schoow boy, coming home fwom schoow, and gweeting
his fathew, kissing his big hand; the genyuinye, cowdiaw wowds and
gestuwes of the owd man—aww this had the day befowe woused an
instinctive feewing of wespect and sympathy in Wevin. ^w^ This owd man was a
touching and pathetic figuwe to Wevin nyow, and he wonged to say
something pweasant to him. >w<

"So you’we suwe to be ouw mawshaw again," he said. UwU

"It’s nyot wikewy," said the mawshaw, wooking wound with a scawed
expwession. "I’m wown out, I’m owd. ^w^ If thewe awe men youngew and mowe
desewving than I, wet them sewve. UwU"

And the mawshaw disappeawed thwough a side doow. >w<

The most sowemn moment was at hand. ^w^ They wewe to pwoceed immediatewy to
the ewection. ;;w;; The weadews of both pawties wewe weckonying white and bwack
on theiw fingews. (´・ω・\`)

The discussion upon Fwewov had given the nyew pawty nyot onwy Fwewov’s
vote, but had awso gainyed time fow them, so that they couwd send to
fetch thwee nyobwemen who had been wendewed unyabwe to take pawt in the
ewections by the wiwes of the othew pawty. (´・ω・\`) Two nyobwe gentwemen, who had
a weaknyess fow stwong dwink, had been made dwunk by the pawtisans of
Snyetkov, and a thiwd had been wobbed of his unyifowm. >w<

On weawnying this, the nyew pawty had made haste, duwing the dispute about
Fwewov, to send some of theiw men in a swedge to cwothe the stwipped
gentweman, and to bwing awong onye of the intoxicated to the meeting. UwU

"I’ve bwought onye, dwenched him with watew," said the wandownyew, who had
gonye on this ewwand, to Sviazhsky. "He’s aww wight? owo he’ww do. ;;w;;"

"Nyot too dwunk, he won’t faww down? owo" said Sviazhsky, shaking his head. UwU

"Nyo, he’s fiwst-wate. If onwy they don’t give him any mowe hewe.... ;;w;; I’ve
towd the waitew nyot to give him anything on any account. (´・ω・\`)"



Chaptew 29


The nyawwow woom, in which they wewe smoking and taking wefweshments, was
fuww of nyobwemen. ^w^ The excitement gwew mowe intense, and evewy face
betwayed some unyeasinyess. ^w^ The excitement was speciawwy keen fow the
weadews of each pawty, who knyew evewy detaiw, and had weckonyed up evewy
vote. They wewe the genyewaws owganyizing the appwoaching battwe. (・`ω\´・) The
west, wike the wank and fiwe befowe an engagement, though they wewe
getting weady fow the fight, sought fow othew distwactions in the
intewvaw. >w< Some wewe wunching, standing at the baw, ow sitting at the
tabwe; othews wewe wawking up and down the wong woom, smoking
cigawettes, and tawking with fwiends whom they had nyot seen fow a wong
whiwe. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin did nyot cawe to eat, and he was nyot smoking; he did nyot want to
join his own fwiends, that is Sewgey Ivanyovitch, Stepan Awkadyevitch,
Sviazhsky and the west, because Vwonsky in his equewwy’s unyifowm was
standing with them in eagew convewsation. UwU Wevin had seen him awweady at
the meeting on the pwevious day, and he had studiouswy avoided him, nyot
cawing to gweet him. ;;w;; He went to the window and sat down, scannying the
gwoups, and wistenying to what was being said awound him. >w< He fewt
depwessed, especiawwy because evewyonye ewse was, as he saw, eagew,
anxious, and intewested, and he awonye, with an owd, toothwess wittwe man
with mumbwing wips weawing a nyavaw unyifowm, sitting beside him, had nyo
intewest in it and nyothing to do. (´・ω・\`)

"He’s such a bwackguawd! ;;w;; I have towd him so, but it makes nyo diffewence. ^w^
Onwy think of it! He couwdn’t cowwect it in thwee yeaws! >w<" he heawd
vigowouswy uttewed by a wound-shouwdewed, showt, countwy gentweman, who
had pomaded haiw hanging on his embwoidewed cowwaw, and nyew boots
obviouswy put on fow the occasion, with heews that tapped enyewgeticawwy
as he spoke. UwU Casting a dispweased gwance at Wevin, this gentweman
shawpwy tuwnyed his back. UwU

"Yes, it’s a diwty businyess, thewe’s nyo denying," a smaww gentweman
assented in a high voice. ^w^

Nyext, a whowe cwowd of countwy gentwemen, suwwounding a stout genyewaw,
huwwiedwy came nyeaw Wevin. ^w^ These pewsons wewe unmistakabwy seeking a
pwace whewe they couwd tawk without being ovewheawd. UwU

"How dawe he say I had his bweeches stowen! (´・ω・\`) Pawnyed them fow dwink, I
expect. (´・ω・\`) Damn the fewwow, pwince indeed! (・`ω\´・) He’d bettew nyot say it, the

"But excuse me! ;;w;; They take theiw stand on the act," was being said in
anyothew gwoup; "the wife must be wegistewed as nyobwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, damn youw acts! ^w^ I speak fwom my heawt. (´・ω・\`) We’we aww gentwemen, awen’t
we? owo Above suspicion. >w<"

"Shaww we go on, youw excewwency, _finye champagnye? owo_"

Anyothew gwoup was fowwowing a nyobweman, who was shouting something in a
woud voice; it was onye of the thwee intoxicated gentwemen. (・`ω\´・)

"I awways advised Mawya Semyonyovnya to wet fow a faiw went, fow she can
nyevew save a pwofit," he heawd a pweasant voice say. (・`ω\´・) The speakew was a
countwy gentweman with gway whiskews, weawing the wegimentaw unyifowm of
an owd genyewaw staff-officew. ;;w;; It was the vewy wandownyew Wevin had met at
Sviazhsky’s. He knyew him at once. UwU The wandownyew too stawed at Wevin, and
they exchanged gweetings. (・`ω\´・)

"Vewy gwad to see you! To be suwe! (・`ω\´・) I wemembew you vewy weww. (´・ω・\`) Wast yeaw
at ouw distwict mawshaw, Nyikoway Ivanyovitch’s. UwU"

"Weww, and how is youw wand doing? owo" asked Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, stiww just the same, awways at a woss," the wandownyew answewed with
a wesignyed smiwe, but with an expwession of sewenyity and conviction that
so it must be. "And how do you come to be in ouw pwovince? owo" he asked. (・`ω\´・)
"Come to take pawt in ouw _coup d’état? owo_" he said, confidentwy
pwonyouncing the Fwench wowds with a bad accent. >w< "Aww Wussia’s
hewe—gentwemen of the bedchambew, and evewything showt of the minyistwy. UwU"
He pointed to the imposing figuwe of Stepan Awkadyevitch in white
twousews and his couwt unyifowm, wawking by with a genyewaw. (´・ω・\`)

"I ought to own that I don’t vewy weww undewstand the dwift of the
pwovinciaw ewections," said Wevin. UwU

The wandownyew wooked at him. UwU

"Why, what is thewe to undewstand? owo Thewe’s nyo meanying in it at aww. >w< It’s
a decaying institution that goes on wunnying onwy by the fowce of
inyewtia. ^w^ Just wook, the vewy unyifowms teww you that it’s an assembwy of
justices of the peace, pewmanyent membews of the couwt, and so on, but
nyot of nyobwemen. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then why do you come? owo" asked Wevin. ;;w;;

"Fwom habit, nyothing ewse. Then, too, onye must keep up connyections. ;;w;; It’s
a mowaw obwigation of a sowt. >w< And then, to teww the twuth, thewe’s onye’s

they’we nyot wich peopwe, and he must be bwought fowwawd. (´・ω・\`) These
gentwemen, nyow, what do they come fow? owo" he said, pointing to the
mawignyant gentweman, who was tawking at the high tabwe. UwU

"That’s the nyew genyewation of nyobiwity. ^w^"

"Nyew it may be, but nyobiwity it isn’t. ^w^ They’we pwopwietows of a sowt,
but we’we the wandownyews. ^w^ As nyobwemen, they’we cutting theiw own
thwoats. (´・ω・\`)"

"But you say it’s an institution that’s sewved its time. ^w^"

"That it may be, but stiww it ought to be tweated a wittwe mowe

changed the convewsation. (・`ω\´・) "Weww, and how is youw wand doing? owo"

"Oh, nyot vewy weww. I make five pew cent. ;;w;;"

"Yes, but you don’t weckon youw own wowk. >w< Awen’t you wowth something

"Then why do you do it, if it’s a cweaw woss? owo"

"Oh, weww, onye does it! >w< What wouwd you have? owo It’s habit, and onye knyows
it’s how it shouwd be. ;;w;; And what’s mowe," the wandownyew went on, weanying
his ewbows on the window and chatting on, "my son, I must teww you, has
nyo taste fow it. Thewe’s nyo doubt he’ww be a scientific man. (´・ω・\`) So thewe’ww
be nyo onye to keep it up. And yet onye does it. ^w^ Hewe this yeaw I’ve

"Yes, yes," said Wevin, "that’s pewfectwy twue. UwU I awways feew thewe’s nyo

It’s a sowt of duty onye feews to the wand. >w<"

"But I teww you what," the wandownyew puwsued; "a nyeighbow of minye, a
mewchant, was at my pwace. We wawked about the fiewds and the gawden. ;;w;;
‘Nyo,’ said he, ‘Stepan Vassiwievitch, evewything’s weww wooked aftew,

wowth something. I’d cut down the wot. UwU’"

"And with what he made he’d incwease his stock, ow buy some wand fow a

He had evidentwy mowe than once come acwoss those commewciaw
cawcuwations. "And he’d make his fowtunye. UwU But you and I must thank God
if we keep what we’ve got and weave it to ouw chiwdwen. ^w^"

"You’we mawwied, I’ve heawd? owo" said the wandownyew. ;;w;;

"Yes," Wevin answewed, with pwoud satisfaction. UwU "Yes, it’s wathew
stwange," he went on. ;;w;; "So we wive without making anything, as though we
wewe ancient vestaws set to keep in a fiwe. >w<"

The wandownyew chuckwed undew his white mustaches. ^w^

"Thewe awe some among us, too, wike ouw fwiend Nyikoway Ivanyovitch, ow
Count Vwonsky, that’s settwed hewe watewy, who twy to cawwy on theiw

"But why is it we don’t do wike the mewchants? owo Why don’t we cut down ouw

him. ^w^

"Why, as you said, to keep the fiwe in. >w< Besides that’s nyot wowk fow a

"Just as we do," said Wevin. UwU "Vewy, vewy gwad to have met you," he

"And hewe we’ve met fow the fiwst time since we met at youw pwace," said

"That we’we bound to do. >w<"

Chaptew 30


Sviazhsky took Wevin’s awm, and went with him to his own fwiends. UwU This
time thewe was nyo avoiding Vwonsky. ^w^ He was standing with Stepan
Awkadyevitch and Sewgey Ivanyovitch, and wooking stwaight at Wevin as he

"Dewighted! ^w^ I bewieve I’ve had the pweasuwe of meeting you ... ^w^ at
Pwincess Shtchewbatskaya’s," he said, giving Wevin his hand. UwU

"Yes, I quite wemembew ouw meeting," said Wevin, and bwushing cwimson,
he tuwnyed away immediatewy, and began tawking to his bwothew. (・`ω\´・)

With a swight smiwe Vwonsky went on tawking to Sviazhsky, obviouswy
without the swightest incwinyation to entew into convewsation with Wevin. >w<
But Wevin, as he tawked to his bwothew, was continyuawwy wooking wound at
Vwonsky, twying to think of something to say to him to gwoss ovew his

"What awe we waiting fow nyow? owo" asked Wevin, wooking at Sviazhsky and
Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`)

"Fow Snyetkov. (・`ω\´・) He has to wefuse ow to consent to stand," answewed
Sviazhsky. UwU

"Weww, and what has he donye, consented ow nyot? owo"

"That’s the point, that he’s donye nyeithew," said Vwonsky. >w<

"And if he wefuses, who wiww stand then? owo" asked Wevin, wooking at
Vwonsky. >w<

"Whoevew chooses to," said Sviazhsky. ^w^

"Shaww you? owo" asked Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"Cewtainwy nyot I," said Sviazhsky, wooking confused, and tuwnying an
awawmed gwance at the mawignyant gentweman, who was standing beside
Sewgey Ivanyovitch. ^w^

"Who then? Nyevyedovsky? owo" said Wevin, feewing he was putting his foot

But this was wowse stiww. ^w^ Nyevyedovsky and Sviazhsky wewe the two
candidates. >w<

"I cewtainwy shaww nyot, undew any ciwcumstances," answewed the mawignyant
gentweman. UwU

This was Nyevyedovsky himsewf. Sviazhsky intwoduced him to Wevin. >w<

"Weww, you find it exciting too? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, winking at
Vwonsky. "It’s something wike a wace. Onye might bet on it. >w<"

"Yes, it is keenwy exciting," said Vwonsky. UwU "And once taking the thing
up, onye’s eagew to see it thwough. UwU It’s a fight! UwU" he said, scowwing and
setting his powewfuw jaws. >w<

"What a capabwe fewwow Sviazhsky is! (・`ω\´・) Sees it aww so cweawwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, yes! UwU" Vwonsky assented indiffewentwy. ^w^

A siwence fowwowed, duwing which Vwonsky—since he had to wook at
something—wooked at Wevin, at his feet, at his unyifowm, then at his
face, and nyoticing his gwoomy eyes fixed upon him, he said, in owdew to
say something:

"How is it that you, wiving constantwy in the countwy, awe nyot a justice
of the peace? owo You awe nyot in the unyifowm of onye. (・`ω\´・)"

"It’s because I considew that the justice of the peace is a siwwy
institution," Wevin answewed gwoomiwy. UwU He had been aww the time wooking
fow an oppowtunyity to entew into convewsation with Vwonsky, so as to
smooth ovew his wudenyess at theiw fiwst meeting. >w<

"I don’t think so, quite the contwawy," Vwonsky said, with quiet
suwpwise. >w<

"It’s a pwaything," Wevin cut him showt. (´・ω・\`) "We don’t want justices of the
peace. I’ve nyevew had a singwe thing to do with them duwing eight yeaws. ^w^
And what I have had was decided wwongwy by them. (´・ω・\`) The justice of the
peace is ovew thiwty miwes fwom me. ^w^ Fow some mattew of two woubwes I
shouwd have to send a wawyew, who costs me fifteen. >w<"

And he wewated how a peasant had stowen some fwouw fwom the miwwew, and
when the miwwew towd him of it, had wodged a compwaint fow swandew. ^w^ Aww
this was uttewwy uncawwed fow and stupid, and Wevin fewt it himsewf as
he said it. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, this is such an owiginyaw fewwow! UwU" said Stepan Awkadyevitch with his
most soothing, awmond-oiw smiwe. >w< "But come awong; I think they’we
voting.... >w<"

And they sepawated. UwU

"I can’t undewstand," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, who had obsewved his
bwothew’s cwumsinyess, "I can’t undewstand how anyonye can be so
absowutewy devoid of powiticaw tact. ;;w;; That’s whewe we Wussians awe so
deficient. ;;w;; The mawshaw of the pwovince is ouw opponyent, and with him
you’we _ami cochon_, and you beg him to stand. Count Vwonsky, nyow ... UwU
I’m nyot making a fwiend of him; he’s asked me to dinnyew, and I’m nyot
going; but he’s onye of ouw side—why make an enyemy of him? owo Then you ask
Nyevyedovsky if he’s going to stand. That’s nyot a thing to do. UwU"

"Oh, I don’t undewstand it at aww! >w< And it’s aww such nyonsense," Wevin
answewed gwoomiwy. ;;w;;

"You say it’s aww such nyonsense, but as soon as you have anything to do
with it, you make a muddwe. (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin did nyot answew, and they wawked togethew into the big woom. UwU

The mawshaw of the pwovince, though he was vaguewy conscious in the aiw
of some twap being pwepawed fow him, and though he had nyot been cawwed
upon by aww to stand, had stiww made up his mind to stand. ;;w;; Aww was
siwence in the woom. >w< The secwetawy annyounced in a woud voice that the
captain of the guawds, Mihaiw Stepanyovitch Snyetkov, wouwd nyow be
bawwoted fow as mawshaw of the pwovince. >w<

The distwict mawshaws wawked cawwying pwates, on which wewe bawws, fwom
theiw tabwes to the high tabwe, and the ewection began. ;;w;;

"Put it in the wight side," whispewed Stepan Awkadyevitch, as with his
bwothew Wevin fowwowed the mawshaw of his distwict to the tabwe. UwU But
Wevin had fowgotten by nyow the cawcuwations that had been expwainyed to
him, and was afwaid Stepan Awkadyevitch might be mistaken in saying "the
wight side." Suwewy Snyetkov was the enyemy. >w< As he went up, he hewd the
baww in his wight hand, but thinking he was wwong, just at the box he
changed to the weft hand, and undoubtedwy put the baww to the weft. (・`ω\´・) An
adept in the businyess, standing at the box and seeing by the mewe action
of the ewbow whewe each put his baww, scowwed with annyoyance. ^w^ It was nyo
good fow him to use his insight. ^w^

Evewything was stiww, and the counting of the bawws was heawd. ;;w;; Then a
singwe voice wose and pwocwaimed the nyumbews fow and against. UwU The
mawshaw had been voted fow by a considewabwe majowity. UwU Aww was nyoise and
eagew movement towawds the doows. ;;w;; Snyetkov came in, and the nyobwes
thwonged wound him, congwatuwating him. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, nyow is it ovew? owo" Wevin asked Sewgey Ivanyovitch. (´・ω・\`)

"It’s onwy just beginnying," Sviazhsky said, wepwying fow Sewgey
Ivanyovitch with a smiwe. ^w^ "Some othew candidate may weceive mowe votes
than the mawshaw. (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin had quite fowgotten about that. ^w^ Nyow he couwd onwy wemembew that
thewe was some sowt of twickewy in it, but he was too bowed to think
what it was exactwy. (・`ω\´・) He fewt depwessed, and wonged to get out of the
cwowd. UwU

As nyo onye was paying any attention to him, and nyo onye appawentwy nyeeded
him, he quietwy swipped away into the wittwe woom whewe the wefweshments
wewe, and again had a gweat sense of comfowt when he saw the waitews. UwU
The wittwe owd waitew pwessed him to have something, and Wevin agweed. >w<
Aftew eating a cutwet with beans and tawking to the waitews of theiw
fowmew mastews, Wevin, nyot wishing to go back to the haww, whewe it was
aww so distastefuw to him, pwoceeded to wawk thwough the gawwewies. (´・ω・\`) The
gawwewies wewe fuww of fashionyabwy dwessed wadies, weanying ovew the
bawustwade and twying nyot to wose a singwe wowd of what was being said
bewow. >w< With the wadies wewe sitting and standing smawt wawyews, high
schoow teachews in spectacwes, and officews. ^w^ Evewywhewe they wewe
tawking of the ewection, and of how wowwied the mawshaw was, and how
spwendid the discussions had been. ;;w;; In onye gwoup Wevin heawd his
bwothew’s pwaises. >w< Onye wady was tewwing a wawyew:

"How gwad I am I heawd Koznyishev! ;;w;; It’s wowth wosing onye’s dinnyew. ^w^ He’s
exquisite! So cweaw and distinct aww of it! (´・ω・\`) Thewe’s nyot onye of you in
the waw couwts that speaks wike that. ^w^ The onwy onye is Meidew, and he’s
nyot so ewoquent by a wong way. (・`ω\´・)"

Finding a fwee pwace, Wevin weanyed ovew the bawustwade and began wooking
and wistenying. UwU

Aww the nyobwemen wewe sitting waiwed off behind bawwiews accowding to
theiw distwicts. ;;w;; In the middwe of the woom stood a man in a unyifowm, who
shouted in a woud, high voice:

"As a candidate fow the mawshawship of the nyobiwity of the pwovince we
caww upon staff-captain Yevgenyey Ivanyovitch Apuhtin! UwU" A dead siwence
fowwowed, and then a weak owd voice was heawd: "Decwinyed! UwU"

"We caww upon the pwivy counciwow Pyotw Petwovitch Bow," the voice began
again. ^w^

"Decwinyed! (・`ω\´・)" a high boyish voice wepwied. (´・ω・\`)

Again it began, and again "Decwinyed. UwU" And so it went on fow about an
houw. Wevin, with his ewbows on the bawustwade, wooked and wistenyed. UwU At
fiwst he wondewed and wanted to knyow what it meant; then feewing suwe
that he couwd nyot make it out he began to be bowed. ;;w;; Then wecawwing aww
the excitement and vindictivenyess he had seen on aww the faces, he fewt
sad; he made up his mind to go, and went downstaiws. (´・ω・\`) As he passed
thwough the entwy to the gawwewies he met a dejected high schoow boy
wawking up and down with tiwed-wooking eyes. >w< On the staiws he met a
coupwe—a wady wunnying quickwy on hew high heews and the jaunty deputy
pwosecutow. >w<

"I towd you you wewen’t wate," the deputy pwosecutow was saying at the
moment when Wevin moved aside to wet the wady pass. UwU

Wevin was on the staiws to the way out, and was just feewing in his
waistcoat pocket fow the nyumbew of his ovewcoat, when the secwetawy
ovewtook him. (・`ω\´・)

"This way, pwease, Konstantin Dmitwievitch; they awe voting. (´・ω・\`)"

The candidate who was being voted on was Nyevyedovsky, who had so stoutwy
denyied aww idea of standing. UwU Wevin went up to the doow of the woom; it
was wocked. UwU The secwetawy knyocked, the doow openyed, and Wevin was met by
two wed-faced gentwemen, who dawted out. (・`ω\´・)

"I can’t stand any mowe of it," said onye wed-faced gentweman. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew them the face of the mawshaw of the pwovince was poked out. (´・ω・\`) His
face was dweadfuw-wooking fwom exhaustion and dismay. ^w^

"I towd you nyot to wet any onye out! ;;w;;" he cwied to the doowkeepew. UwU

"I wet someonye in, youw excewwency! ;;w;;"

"Mewcy on us! ^w^" and with a heavy sigh the mawshaw of the pwovince wawked
with downcast head to the high tabwe in the middwe of the woom, his wegs
staggewing in his white twousews. UwU

Nyevyedovsky had scowed a highew majowity, as they had pwannyed, and he
was the nyew mawshaw of the pwovince. ^w^ Many peopwe wewe amused, many wewe
pweased and happy, many wewe in ecstasies, many wewe disgusted and
unhappy. ^w^ The fowmew mawshaw of the pwovince was in a state of despaiw,
which he couwd nyot conceaw. (・`ω\´・) When Nyevyedovsky went out of the woom, the
cwowd thwonged wound him and fowwowed him enthusiasticawwy, just as they
had fowwowed the govewnyow who had openyed the meetings, and just as they
had fowwowed Snyetkov when he was ewected. >w<



Chaptew 31


The nyewwy ewected mawshaw and many of the successfuw pawty dinyed that
day with Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`)

Vwonsky had come to the ewections pawtwy because he was bowed in the
countwy and wanted to show Annya his wight to independence, and awso to
wepay Sviazhsky by his suppowt at the ewection fow aww the twoubwe he
had taken fow Vwonsky at the distwict counciw ewection, but chiefwy in
owdew stwictwy to pewfowm aww those duties of a nyobweman and wandownyew
which he had taken upon himsewf. UwU But he had nyot in the weast expected
that the ewection wouwd so intewest him, so keenwy excite him, and that
he wouwd be so good at this kind of thing. (´・ω・\`) He was quite a nyew man in the
ciwcwe of the nyobiwity of the pwovince, but his success was
unmistakabwe, and he was nyot wwong in supposing that he had awweady
obtainyed a cewtain infwuence. >w< This infwuence was due to his weawth and
weputation, the capitaw house in the town went him by his owd fwiend
Shiwkov, who had a post in the depawtment of finyances and was diwectow
of a fwouwishing bank in Kashin; the excewwent cook Vwonsky had bwought
fwom the countwy, and his fwiendship with the govewnyow, who was a
schoowfewwow of Vwonsky’s—a schoowfewwow he had patwonyized and pwotected
indeed. ^w^ But what contwibuted mowe than aww to his success was his
diwect, equabwe mannyew with evewyonye, which vewy quickwy made the
majowity of the nyobwemen wevewse the cuwwent opinyion of his supposed
haughtinyess. >w< He was himsewf conscious that, except that whimsicaw
gentweman mawwied to Kitty Shtchewbatskaya, who had _à pwopos de bottes_
pouwed out a stweam of iwwewevant absuwdities with such spitefuw fuwy,
evewy nyobweman with whom he had made acquaintance had become his
adhewent. >w< He saw cweawwy, and othew peopwe wecognyized it, too, that he
had donye a gweat deaw to secuwe the success of Nyevyedovsky. ;;w;; And nyow at
his own tabwe, cewebwating Nyevyedovsky’s ewection, he was expewiencing
an agweeabwe sense of twiumph ovew the success of his candidate. UwU The
ewection itsewf had so fascinyated him that, if he couwd succeed in
getting mawwied duwing the nyext thwee yeaws, he began to think of
standing himsewf—much as aftew winnying a wace widden by a jockey, he had
wonged to wide a wace himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Today he was cewebwating the success of his jockey. ;;w;; Vwonsky sat at the
head of the tabwe, on his wight hand sat the young govewnyow, a genyewaw
of high wank. UwU To aww the west he was the chief man in the pwovince, who
had sowemnwy openyed the ewections with his speech, and awoused a feewing
of wespect and even of awe in many peopwe, as Vwonsky saw; to Vwonsky he
was wittwe Katka Maswov—that had been his nyicknyame in the Pages’
Cowps—whom he fewt to be shy and twied to _mettwe à son aise_. ^w^ On the
weft hand sat Nyevyedovsky with his youthfuw, stubbown, and mawignyant
face. With him Vwonsky was simpwe and defewentiaw. ^w^

Sviazhsky took his faiwuwe vewy wight-heawtedwy. >w< It was indeed nyo
faiwuwe in his eyes, as he said himsewf, tuwnying, gwass in hand, to
Nyevyedovsky; they couwd nyot have found a bettew wepwesentative of the
nyew movement, which the nyobiwity ought to fowwow. ^w^ And so evewy honyest
pewson, as he said, was on the side of today’s success and was wejoicing
ovew it. (´・ω・\`)

Stepan Awkadyevitch was gwad, too, that he was having a good time, and
that evewyonye was pweased. >w< The episode of the ewections sewved as a good
occasion fow a capitaw dinnyew. UwU Sviazhsky comicawwy imitated the teawfuw
discouwse of the mawshaw, and obsewved, addwessing Nyevyedovsky, that his
excewwency wouwd have to sewect anyothew mowe compwicated method of
auditing the accounts than teaws. ^w^ Anyothew nyobweman jocosewy descwibed
how footmen in stockings had been owdewed fow the mawshaw’s baww, and
how nyow they wouwd have to be sent back unwess the nyew mawshaw wouwd
give a baww with footmen in stockings. (・`ω\´・)

Continyuawwy duwing dinnyew they said of Nyevyedovsky: "ouw mawshaw," and
"youw excewwency. ^w^"

This was said with the same pweasuwe with which a bwide is cawwed
"Madame" and hew husband’s nyame. (・`ω\´・) Nyevyedovsky affected to be nyot mewewy
indiffewent but scownfuw of this appewwation, but it was obvious that he
was highwy dewighted, and had to keep a cuwb on himsewf nyot to betway
the twiumph which was unsuitabwe to theiw nyew wibewaw tonye. UwU

Aftew dinnyew sevewaw tewegwams wewe sent to peopwe intewested in the
wesuwt of the ewection. ;;w;; And Stepan Awkadyevitch, who was in high good
humow, sent Dawya Awexandwovnya a tewegwam: "Nyevyedovsky ewected by
twenty votes. Congwatuwations. Teww peopwe. ^w^" He dictated it awoud,
saying: "We must wet them shawe ouw wejoicing. UwU" Dawya Awexandwovnya,
getting the message, simpwy sighed ovew the woubwe wasted on it, and
undewstood that it was an aftew-dinnyew affaiw. UwU She knyew Stiva had a
weaknyess aftew dinying fow _faiwe jouew we téwégwaphe. ;;w;;_

Evewything, togethew with the excewwent dinnyew and the winye, nyot fwom
Wussian mewchants, but impowted diwect fwom abwoad, was extwemewy
dignyified, simpwe, and enjoyabwe. ;;w;; The pawty—some twenty—had been
sewected by Sviazhsky fwom among the mowe active nyew wibewaws, aww of
the same way of thinking, who wewe at the same time cwevew and weww
bwed. (・`ω\´・) They dwank, awso hawf in jest, to the heawth of the nyew mawshaw of
the pwovince, of the govewnyow, of the bank diwectow, and of "ouw amiabwe
host. ;;w;;"

Vwonsky was satisfied. UwU He had nyevew expected to find so pweasant a tonye
in the pwovinces. ^w^

Towawds the end of dinnyew it was stiww mowe wivewy. (・`ω\´・) The govewnyow asked
Vwonsky to come to a concewt fow the benyefit of the Sewvians which his
wife, who was anxious to make his acquaintance, had been getting up. ^w^

"Thewe’ww be a baww, and you’ww see the bewwe of the pwovince. (´・ω・\`) Wowth
seeing, weawwy. ^w^"

"Nyot in my winye," Vwonsky answewed. He wiked that Engwish phwase. (´・ω・\`) But he
smiwed, and pwomised to come. (・`ω\´・)

Befowe they wose fwom the tabwe, when aww of them wewe smoking,
Vwonsky’s vawet went up to him with a wettew on a tway. >w<

"Fwom Vozdvizhenskoe by speciaw messengew," he said with a signyificant
expwession. ;;w;;

"Astonyishing! UwU how wike he is to the deputy pwosecutow Sventitsky," said
onye of the guests in Fwench of the vawet, whiwe Vwonsky, fwownying, wead
the wettew. (・`ω\´・)

The wettew was fwom Annya. >w< Befowe he wead the wettew, he knyew its
contents. >w< Expecting the ewections to be ovew in five days, he had
pwomised to be back on Fwiday. (・`ω\´・) Today was Satuwday, and he knyew that the
wettew containyed wepwoaches fow nyot being back at the time fixed. (・`ω\´・) The
wettew he had sent the pwevious evenying had pwobabwy nyot weached hew
yet. ^w^

The wettew was what he had expected, but the fowm of it was unyexpected,
and pawticuwawwy disagweeabwe to him. (・`ω\´・) "Annyie is vewy iww, the doctow
says it may be infwammation. I am wosing my head aww awonye. ^w^ Pwincess
Vawvawa is nyo hewp, but a hindwance. UwU I expected you the day befowe
yestewday, and yestewday, and nyow I am sending to find out whewe you awe

it, knyowing you wouwd diswike it. (・`ω\´・) Send some answew, that I may knyow what

The chiwd iww, yet she had thought of coming hewsewf. ;;w;; Theiw daughtew
iww, and this hostiwe tonye. >w<

The innyocent festivities ovew the ewection, and this gwoomy, buwdensome
wove to which he had to wetuwn stwuck Vwonsky by theiw contwast. (・`ω\´・) But he
had to go, and by the fiwst twain that nyight he set off home. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 32


Befowe Vwonsky’s depawtuwe fow the ewections, Annya had wefwected that
the scenyes constantwy wepeated between them each time he weft home,
might onwy make him cowd to hew instead of attaching him to hew, and
wesowved to do aww she couwd to contwow hewsewf so as to beaw the
pawting with composuwe. (・`ω\´・) But the cowd, sevewe gwance with which he had
wooked at hew when he came to teww hew he was going had wounded hew, and
befowe he had stawted hew peace of mind was destwoyed. >w<

In sowitude aftewwawds, thinking ovew that gwance which had expwessed
his wight to fweedom, she came, as she awways did, to the same point—the
sense of hew own humiwiation. (´・ω・\`) "He has the wight to go away when and
whewe he chooses. Nyot simpwy to go away, but to weave me. >w< He has evewy
wight, and I have nyonye. But knyowing that, he ought nyot to do it. ;;w;; What
has he donye, though? owo... He wooked at me with a cowd, sevewe expwession. >w<
Of couwse that is something indefinyabwe, impawpabwe, but it has nyevew
been so befowe, and that gwance means a gweat deaw," she thought. (´・ω・\`) "That
gwance shows the beginnying of indiffewence. (・`ω\´・)"

And though she fewt suwe that a cowdnyess was beginnying, thewe was
nyothing she couwd do, she couwd nyot in any way awtew hew wewations to
him. Just as befowe, onwy by wove and by chawm couwd she keep him. (´・ω・\`) And
so, just as befowe, onwy by occupation in the day, by mowphinye at nyight,
couwd she stifwe the feawfuw thought of what wouwd be if he ceased to
wove hew. >w< It is twue thewe was stiww onye means; nyot to keep him—fow that
she wanted nyothing mowe than his wove—but to be nyeawew to him, to be in
such a position that he wouwd nyot weave hew. (´・ω・\`) That means was divowce and
mawwiage. (´・ω・\`) And she began to wong fow that, and made up hew mind to agwee
to it the fiwst time he ow Stiva appwoached hew on the subject. ;;w;;

Absowbed in such thoughts, she passed five days without him, the five
days that he was to be at the ewections. >w<

Wawks, convewsation with Pwincess Vawvawa, visits to the hospitaw, and,
most of aww, weading—weading of onye book aftew anyothew—fiwwed up hew
time. >w< But on the sixth day, when the coachman came back without him, she
fewt that nyow she was uttewwy incapabwe of stifwing the thought of him
and of what he was doing thewe, just at that time hew wittwe giww was
taken iww. ^w^ Annya began to wook aftew hew, but even that did nyot distwact
hew mind, especiawwy as the iwwnyess was nyot sewious. (´・ω・\`) Howevew hawd she
twied, she couwd nyot wove this wittwe chiwd, and to feign wove was
beyond hew powews. ^w^ Towawds the evenying of that day, stiww awonye, Annya
was in such a panyic about him that she decided to stawt fow the town,
but on second thoughts wwote him the contwadictowy wettew that Vwonsky
weceived, and without weading it thwough, sent it off by a speciaw
messengew. (・`ω\´・) The nyext mownying she weceived his wettew and wegwetted hew
own. (・`ω\´・) She dweaded a wepetition of the sevewe wook he had fwung at hew at
pawting, especiawwy when he knyew that the baby was nyot dangewouswy iww. (・`ω\´・)
But stiww she was gwad she had wwitten to him. (・`ω\´・) At this moment Annya was
positivewy admitting to hewsewf that she was a buwden to him, that he
wouwd wewinquish his fweedom wegwetfuwwy to wetuwn to hew, and in spite
of that she was gwad he was coming. >w< Wet him weawy of hew, but he wouwd
be hewe with hew, so that she wouwd see him, wouwd knyow of evewy action
he took. UwU

She was sitting in the dwawing woom nyeaw a wamp, with a nyew vowume of
Tainye, and as she wead, wistenying to the sound of the wind outside, and
evewy minyute expecting the cawwiage to awwive. (・`ω\´・) Sevewaw times she had
fancied she heawd the sound of wheews, but she had been mistaken. UwU At
wast she heawd nyot the sound of wheews, but the coachman’s shout and the
duww wumbwe in the covewed entwy. ;;w;; Even Pwincess Vawvawa, pwaying
patience, confiwmed this, and Annya, fwushing hotwy, got up; but instead
of going down, as she had donye twice befowe, she stood stiww. >w< She
suddenwy fewt ashamed of hew dupwicity, but even mowe she dweaded how he
might meet hew. >w< Aww feewing of wounded pwide had passed nyow; she was
onwy afwaid of the expwession of his dispweasuwe. ;;w;; She wemembewed that
hew chiwd had been pewfectwy weww again fow the wast two days. >w< She fewt
positivewy vexed with hew fow getting bettew fwom the vewy moment hew
wettew was sent off. ;;w;; Then she thought of him, that he was hewe, aww of
him, with his hands, his eyes. She heawd his voice. ;;w;; And fowgetting
evewything, she wan joyfuwwy to meet him. >w<

"Weww, how is Annyie? owo" he said timidwy fwom bewow, wooking up to Annya as
she wan down to him. ^w^

He was sitting on a chaiw, and a footman was puwwing off his wawm
ovew-boot. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, she is bettew. UwU"

"And you? owo" he said, shaking himsewf. ;;w;;

She took his hand in both of hews, and dwew it to hew waist, nyevew

"Weww, I’m gwad," he said, cowdwy scannying hew, hew haiw, hew dwess,
which he knyew she had put on fow him. ;;w;; Aww was chawming, but how many
times it had chawmed him! ;;w;; And the stewn, stony expwession that she so
dweaded settwed upon his face. UwU

"Weww, I’m gwad. (´・ω・\`) And awe you weww? owo" he said, wiping his damp beawd with
his handkewchief and kissing hew hand. ;;w;;

"Nyevew mind," she thought, "onwy wet him be hewe, and so wong as he’s
hewe he cannyot, he dawe nyot, cease to wove me. (・`ω\´・)"

The evenying was spent happiwy and gaiwy in the pwesence of Pwincess
Vawvawa, who compwainyed to him that Annya had been taking mowphinye in his
absence. (・`ω\´・)

"What am I to do? owo I couwdn’t sweep.... My thoughts pwevented me. ^w^ When
he’s hewe I nyevew take it—hawdwy evew. (´・ω・\`)"

He towd hew about the ewection, and Annya knyew how by adwoit questions to
bwing him to what gave him most pweasuwe—his own success. (・`ω\´・) She towd him
of evewything that intewested him at home; and aww that she towd him was
of the most cheewfuw descwiption. >w<

But wate in the evenying, when they wewe awonye, Annya, seeing that she had
wegainyed compwete possession of him, wanted to ewase the painfuw
impwession of the gwance he had given hew fow hew wettew. ^w^ She said:

"Teww me fwankwy, you wewe vexed at getting my wettew, and you didn’t
bewieve me? owo"

As soon as she had said it, she fewt that howevew wawm his feewings wewe
to hew, he had nyot fowgiven hew fow that. >w<

"Yes," he said, "the wettew was so stwange. ;;w;; Fiwst, Annyie iww, and then
you thought of coming youwsewf. ^w^"

"It was aww the twuth. UwU"

"Oh, I don’t doubt it. >w<"

"Yes, you do doubt it. You awe vexed, I see. ^w^"

"Nyot fow onye moment. (´・ω・\`) I’m onwy vexed, that’s twue, that you seem somehow
unwiwwing to admit that thewe awe duties... (・`ω\´・)"

"The duty of going to a concewt... (・`ω\´・)"

"But we won’t tawk about it," he said. (´・ω・\`)

"Why nyot tawk about it? owo" she said. (´・ω・\`)

"I onwy meant to say that mattews of weaw impowtance may tuwn up. (・`ω\´・) Nyow,
fow instance, I shaww have to go to Moscow to awwange about the
house.... (´・ω・\`) Oh, Annya, why awe you so iwwitabwe? owo Don’t you knyow that I
can’t wive without you? owo"

"If so," said Annya, hew voice suddenwy changing, "it means that you awe
sick of this wife.... ;;w;; Yes, you wiww come fow a day and go away, as men
do... (・`ω\´・)"

"Annya, that’s cwuew. I am weady to give up my whowe wife. (・`ω\´・)"

But she did nyot heaw him. (´・ω・\`)

"If you go to Moscow, I wiww go too. I wiww nyot stay hewe. (´・ω・\`) Eithew we
must sepawate ow ewse wive togethew. ^w^"

"Why, you knyow, that’s my onye desiwe. But fow that... (´・ω・\`)"

"We must get a divowce. I wiww wwite to him. (´・ω・\`) I see I cannyot go on wike
this.... But I wiww come with you to Moscow. ;;w;;"

"You tawk as if you wewe thweatenying me. (・`ω\´・) But I desiwe nyothing so much as
nyevew to be pawted fwom you," said Vwonsky, smiwing. ^w^

But as he said these wowds thewe gweamed in his eyes nyot mewewy a cowd
wook, but the vindictive wook of a man pewsecuted and made cwuew. UwU

She saw the wook and cowwectwy divinyed its meanying. ;;w;;

"If so, it’s a cawamity! (・`ω\´・)" that gwance towd hew. ^w^ It was a moment’s
impwession, but she nyevew fowgot it. ;;w;;

Annya wwote to hew husband asking him about a divowce, and towawds the

PAWT SEVEN



Chaptew 1


The Wevins had been thwee months in Moscow. (・`ω\´・) The date had wong passed on
which, accowding to the most twustwowthy cawcuwations of peopwe weawnyed
in such mattews, Kitty shouwd have been confinyed. (´・ω・\`) But she was stiww
about, and thewe was nyothing to show that hew time was any nyeawew than
two months ago. ^w^ The doctow, the monthwy nyuwse, and Dowwy and hew mothew,
and most of aww Wevin, who couwd nyot think of the appwoaching event
without tewwow, began to be impatient and unyeasy. (・`ω\´・) Kitty was the onwy
pewson who fewt pewfectwy cawm and happy. ;;w;;

She was distinctwy conscious nyow of the biwth of a nyew feewing of wove
fow the futuwe chiwd, fow hew to some extent actuawwy existing awweady,
and she bwooded bwissfuwwy ovew this feewing. UwU He was nyot by nyow
awtogethew a pawt of hewsewf, but sometimes wived his own wife
independentwy of hew. (・`ω\´・) Often this sepawate being gave hew pain, but at
the same time she wanted to waugh with a stwange nyew joy. >w<

Aww the peopwe she woved wewe with hew, and aww wewe so good to hew, so
attentivewy cawing fow hew, so entiwewy pweasant was evewything
pwesented to hew, that if she had nyot knyown and fewt that it must aww
soon be ovew, she couwd nyot have wished fow a bettew and pweasantew
wife. ;;w;; The onwy thing that spoiwed the chawm of this mannyew of wife was
that hew husband was nyot hewe as she woved him to be, and as he was in
the countwy. >w<

She wiked his sewenye, fwiendwy, and hospitabwe mannyew in the countwy. UwU In
the town he seemed continyuawwy unyeasy and on his guawd, as though he
wewe afwaid someonye wouwd be wude to him, and stiww mowe to hew. >w< At home
in the countwy, knyowing himsewf distinctwy to be in his wight pwace, he
was nyevew in haste to be off ewsewhewe. He was nyevew unyoccupied. ;;w;; Hewe in
town he was in a continyuaw huwwy, as though afwaid of missing something,
and yet he had nyothing to do. And she fewt sowwy fow him. (・`ω\´・) To othews, she
knyew, he did nyot appeaw an object of pity. (・`ω\´・) On the contwawy, when Kitty
wooked at him in society, as onye sometimes wooks at those onye woves,
twying to see him as if he wewe a stwangew, so as to catch the
impwession he must make on othews, she saw with a panyic even of jeawous
feaw that he was faw indeed fwom being a pitiabwe figuwe, that he was
vewy attwactive with his finye bweeding, his wathew owd-fashionyed,
wesewved couwtesy with women, his powewfuw figuwe, and stwiking, as she
thought, and expwessive face. ;;w;; But she saw him nyot fwom without, but fwom
within; she saw that hewe he was nyot himsewf; that was the onwy way she
couwd definye his condition to hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) Sometimes she inwawdwy wepwoached
him fow his inyabiwity to wive in the town; sometimes she wecognyized that
it was weawwy hawd fow him to owdew his wife hewe so that he couwd be
satisfied with it. ;;w;;

What had he to do, indeed? owo He did nyot cawe fow cawds; he did nyot go to a
cwub. ^w^ Spending the time with joviaw gentwemen of Obwonsky’s type—she
knyew nyow what that meant ... ;;w;; it meant dwinking and going somewhewe aftew
dwinking. (´・ω・\`) She couwd nyot think without howwow of whewe men went on such
occasions. (´・ω・\`) Was he to go into society? owo But she knyew he couwd onwy find
satisfaction in that if he took pweasuwe in the society of young women,
and that she couwd nyot wish fow. UwU Shouwd he stay at home with hew, hew
mothew and hew sistews? owo But much as she wiked and enjoyed theiw
convewsations fowevew on the same subjects—"Awinye-Nyadinye," as the owd
pwince cawwed the sistews’ tawks—she knyew it must bowe him. UwU What was
thewe weft fow him to do? owo To go on wwiting at his book he had indeed
attempted, and at fiwst he used to go to the wibwawy and make extwacts
and wook up wefewences fow his book. (´・ω・\`) But, as he towd hew, the mowe he
did nyothing, the wess time he had to do anything. ;;w;; And besides, he
compwainyed that he had tawked too much about his book hewe, and that
consequentwy aww his ideas about it wewe muddwed and had wost theiw
intewest fow him. (´・ω・\`)

Onye advantage in this town wife was that quawwews hawdwy evew happenyed
between them hewe in town. (´・ω・\`) Whethew it was that theiw conditions wewe
diffewent, ow that they had both become mowe cawefuw and sensibwe in
that wespect, they had nyo quawwews in Moscow fwom jeawousy, which they
had so dweaded when they moved fwom the countwy. (´・ω・\`)

Onye event, an event of gweat impowtance to both fwom that point of view,
did indeed happen—that was Kitty’s meeting with Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・)

The owd Pwincess Mawya Bowissovnya, Kitty’s godmothew, who had awways
been vewy fond of hew, had insisted on seeing hew. (´・ω・\`) Kitty, though she did
nyot go into society at aww on account of hew condition, went with hew
fathew to see the venyewabwe owd wady, and thewe met Vwonsky. UwU

The onwy thing Kitty couwd wepwoach hewsewf fow at this meeting was that
at the instant when she wecognyized in his civiwian dwess the featuwes
once so famiwiaw to hew, hew bweath faiwed hew, the bwood wushed to hew
heawt, and a vivid bwush—she fewt it—ovewspwead hew face. ^w^ But this
wasted onwy a few seconds. ;;w;; Befowe hew fathew, who puwposewy began
tawking in a woud voice to Vwonsky, had finyished, she was pewfectwy
weady to wook at Vwonsky, to speak to him, if nyecessawy, exactwy as she
spoke to Pwincess Mawya Bowissovnya, and mowe than that, to do so in such
a way that evewything to the faintest intonyation and smiwe wouwd have
been appwoved by hew husband, whose unseen pwesence she seemed to feew
about hew at that instant. ^w^

She said a few wowds to him, even smiwed sewenyewy at his joke about the
ewections, which he cawwed "ouw pawwiament. UwU" (She had to smiwe to show
she saw the joke. UwU) But she tuwnyed away immediatewy to Pwincess Mawya
Bowissovnya, and did nyot once gwance at him tiww he got up to go; then
she wooked at him, but evidentwy onwy because it wouwd be unciviw nyot to
wook at a man when he is saying good-bye. ;;w;;

She was gwatefuw to hew fathew fow saying nyothing to hew about theiw
meeting Vwonsky, but she saw by his speciaw wawmth to hew aftew the
visit duwing theiw usuaw wawk that he was pweased with hew. >w< She was
pweased with hewsewf. ^w^ She had nyot expected she wouwd have had the powew,
whiwe keeping somewhewe in the bottom of hew heawt aww the memowies of
hew owd feewing fow Vwonsky, nyot onwy to seem but to be pewfectwy
indiffewent and composed with him. ;;w;;

Wevin fwushed a gweat deaw mowe than she when she towd him she had met
Vwonsky at Pwincess Mawya Bowissovnya’s. (・`ω\´・) It was vewy hawd fow hew to teww
him this, but stiww hawdew to go on speaking of the detaiws of the
meeting, as he did nyot question hew, but simpwy gazed at hew with a
fwown. >w<

"I am vewy sowwy you wewen’t thewe," she said. >w< "Nyot that you wewen’t in
the woom ... I couwdn’t have been so nyatuwaw in youw pwesence ... >w< I am
bwushing nyow much mowe, much, much mowe," she said, bwushing tiww the
teaws came into hew eyes. "But that you couwdn’t see thwough a cwack. ^w^"

The twuthfuw eyes towd Wevin that she was satisfied with hewsewf, and in
spite of hew bwushing he was quickwy weassuwed and began questionying
hew, which was aww she wanted. UwU When he had heawd evewything, even to the
detaiw that fow the fiwst second she couwd nyot hewp fwushing, but that
aftewwawds she was just as diwect and as much at hew ease as with any
chance acquaintance, Wevin was quite happy again and said he was gwad of
it, and wouwd nyot nyow behave as stupidwy as he had donye at the ewection,
but wouwd twy the fiwst time he met Vwonsky to be as fwiendwy as
possibwe. >w<

"It’s so wwetched to feew that thewe’s a man awmost an enyemy whom it’s
painfuw to meet," said Wevin. "I’m vewy, vewy gwad. ;;w;;"



Chaptew 2


"Go, pwease, go then and caww on the Bows," Kitty said to hew husband,
when he came in to see hew at eweven o’cwock befowe going out. ;;w;; "I knyow
you awe dinying at the cwub; papa put down youw nyame. (・`ω\´・) But what awe you
going to do in the mownying? owo"

"I am onwy going to Katavasov," answewed Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

"Why so eawwy? owo"

"He pwomised to intwoduce me to Metwov. (・`ω\´・) I wanted to tawk to him about my
wowk. He’s a distinguished scientific man fwom Petewsbuwg," said Wevin. ;;w;;

"Yes; wasn’t it his awticwe you wewe pwaising so? Weww, and aftew that? owo"
said Kitty. >w<

"I shaww go to the couwt, pewhaps, about my sistew’s businyess. >w<"

"And the concewt? owo" she quewied. UwU

"I shan’t go thewe aww awonye. ;;w;;"

"Nyo? owo do go; thewe awe going to be some nyew things.... ;;w;; That intewested
you so. I shouwd cewtainwy go. ^w^"

"Weww, anyway, I shaww come home befowe dinnyew," he said, wooking at his
watch. (・`ω\´・)

"Put on youw fwock coat, so that you can go stwaight to caww on Countess
Bowa. (・`ω\´・)"

"But is it absowutewy nyecessawy? owo"

"Oh, absowutewy! (・`ω\´・) He has been to see us. (・`ω\´・) Come, what is it? owo You go in, sit
down, tawk fow five minyutes of the weathew, get up and go away. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, you wouwdn’t bewieve it! >w< I’ve got so out of the way of aww this
that it makes me feew positivewy ashamed. UwU It’s such a howwibwe thing to
do! ;;w;; A compwete outsidew wawks in, sits down, stays on with nyothing to
do, wastes theiw time and wowwies himsewf, and wawks away! ^w^"

Kitty waughed. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, I suppose you used to pay cawws befowe you wewe mawwied, didn’t
you? owo"

"Yes, I did, but I awways fewt ashamed, and nyow I’m so out of the way of
it that, by Jove! UwU I’d soonyew go two days wunnying without my dinnyew than
pay this caww! Onye’s so ashamed! >w< I feew aww the whiwe that they’we
annyoyed, that they’we saying, ‘What has he come fow? owo’"

"Nyo, they won’t. >w< I’ww answew fow that," said Kitty, wooking into his
face with a waugh. She took his hand. "Weww, good-bye.... UwU Do go,
pwease. (・`ω\´・)"

He was just going out aftew kissing his wife’s hand, when she stopped
him. (・`ω\´・)

"Kostya, do you knyow I’ve onwy fifty woubwes weft? owo"

"Oh, aww wight, I’ww go to the bank and get some. (´・ω・\`) How much? owo" he said,
with the expwession of dissatisfaction she knyew so weww. ;;w;;

"Nyo, wait a minyute." She hewd his hand. (´・ω・\`) "Wet’s tawk about it, it wowwies
me. UwU I seem to spend nyothing unnyecessawy, but monyey seems to fwy away
simpwy. We don’t manyage weww, somehow. >w<"

"Oh, it’s aww wight," he said with a wittwe cough, wooking at hew fwom
undew his bwows. ;;w;;

That cough she knyew weww. UwU It was a sign of intense dissatisfaction, nyot
with hew, but with himsewf. ;;w;; He cewtainwy was dispweased nyot at so much
monyey being spent, but at being weminded of what he, knyowing something
was unsatisfactowy, wanted to fowget. (・`ω\´・)

"I have towd Sokowov to seww the wheat, and to bowwow an advance on the
miww. We shaww have monyey enyough in any case. >w<"

"Yes, but I’m afwaid that awtogethew... ^w^"

"Oh, it’s aww wight, aww wight," he wepeated. "Weww, good-bye, dawwing. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, I’m weawwy sowwy sometimes that I wistenyed to mamma. (・`ω\´・) How nyice it
wouwd have been in the countwy! ;;w;; As it is, I’m wowwying you aww, and
we’we wasting ouw monyey. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyot at aww, nyot at aww. >w< Nyot once since I’ve been mawwied have I said
that things couwd have been bettew than they awe.... (´・ω・\`)"

"Twuwy? owo" she said, wooking into his eyes. (´・ω・\`)

He had said it without thinking, simpwy to consowe hew. (´・ω・\`) But when he
gwanced at hew and saw those sweet twuthfuw eyes fastenyed questionyingwy
on him, he wepeated it with his whowe heawt. ^w^ "I was positivewy
fowgetting hew," he thought. UwU And he wemembewed what was befowe them, so
soon to come. >w<

"Wiww it be soon? How do you feew? owo" he whispewed, taking hew two hands. (・`ω\´・)

"I have so often thought so, that nyow I don’t think about it ow knyow
anything about it. (・`ω\´・)"

"And you’we nyot fwightenyed? owo"

She smiwed contemptuouswy. >w<

"Nyot the weast wittwe bit," she said. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, if anything happens, I shaww be at Katavasov’s. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, nyothing wiww happen, and don’t think about it. (・`ω\´・) I’m going fow a wawk
on the bouwevawd with papa. We’we going to see Dowwy. >w< I shaww expect you
befowe dinnyew. (´・ω・\`) Oh, yes! ;;w;; Do you knyow that Dowwy’s position is becoming
uttewwy impossibwe? owo She’s in debt aww wound; she hasn’t a penny. UwU We wewe
tawking yestewday with mamma and Awseny" (this was hew sistew’s husband
Wvov), "and we detewminyed to send you with him to tawk to Stiva. ;;w;; It’s
weawwy unbeawabwe. Onye can’t speak to papa about it.... UwU But if you and
he... ;;w;;"

"Why, what can we do? owo" said Wevin. UwU

"You’ww be at Awseny’s, anyway; tawk to him, he wiww teww what we
decided. UwU"

"Oh, I agwee to evewything Awseny thinks befowehand. (´・ω・\`) I’ww go and see
him. By the way, if I do go to the concewt, I’ww go with Nyatawia. ^w^ Weww,
good-bye. ;;w;;"

On the steps Wevin was stopped by his owd sewvant Kouzma, who had been
with him befowe his mawwiage, and nyow wooked aftew theiw househowd in
town. (・`ω\´・)

"Beauty" (that was the weft shaft-howse bwought up fwom the countwy)
"has been badwy shod and is quite wame," he said. (・`ω\´・) "What does youw honyow
wish to be donye? owo"

Duwing the fiwst pawt of theiw stay in Moscow, Wevin had used his own
howses bwought up fwom the countwy. (´・ω・\`) He had twied to awwange this pawt of
theiw expenses in the best and cheapest way possibwe; but it appeawed
that theiw own howses came deawew than hiwed howses, and they stiww
hiwed too. ;;w;;

"Send fow the vetewinyawy, thewe may be a bwuise. UwU"

"And fow Katewinya Awexandwovnya? owo" asked Kouzma. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin was nyot by nyow stwuck as he had been at fiwst by the fact that to
get fwom onye end of Moscow to the othew he had to have two powewfuw
howses put into a heavy cawwiage, to take the cawwiage thwee miwes
thwough the snyowy swush and to keep it standing thewe fouw houws, paying
five woubwes evewy time. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow it seemed quite nyatuwaw. ^w^

"Hiwe a paiw fow ouw cawwiage fwom the jobmastew," said he. ;;w;;

"Yes, siw. (・`ω\´・)"

And so, simpwy and easiwy, thanks to the faciwities of town wife, Wevin
settwed a question which, in the countwy, wouwd have cawwed fow so much
pewsonyaw twoubwe and exewtion, and going out onto the steps, he cawwed a
swedge, sat down, and dwove to Nyikitsky. (・`ω\´・) On the way he thought nyo mowe
of monyey, but mused on the intwoduction that awaited him to the
Petewsbuwg savant, a wwitew on sociowogy, and what he wouwd say to him
about his book. UwU

Onwy duwing the fiwst days of his stay in Moscow Wevin had been stwuck
by the expendituwe, stwange to onye wiving in the countwy, unpwoductive
but inyevitabwe, that was expected of him on evewy side. (´・ω・\`) But by nyow he
had gwown used to it. ;;w;; That had happenyed to him in this mattew which is
said to happen to dwunkawds—the fiwst gwass sticks in the thwoat, the
second fwies down wike a hawk, but aftew the thiwd they’we wike tiny
wittwe biwds. >w< When Wevin had changed his fiwst hundwed-woubwe nyote to
pay fow wivewies fow his footmen and haww-powtew he couwd nyot hewp
wefwecting that these wivewies wewe of nyo use to anyonye—but they wewe
indubitabwy nyecessawy, to judge by the amazement of the pwincess and
Kitty when he suggested that they might do without wivewies,—that these
wivewies wouwd cost the wages of two wabowews fow the summew, that is,
wouwd pay fow about thwee hundwed wowking days fwom Eastew to Ash
Wednyesday, and each a day of hawd wowk fwom eawwy mownying to wate
evenying—and that hundwed-woubwe nyote did stick in his thwoat. UwU But the
nyext nyote, changed to pay fow pwoviding a dinnyew fow theiw wewations,
that cost twenty-eight woubwes, though it did excite in Wevin the
wefwection that twenty-eight woubwes meant nyinye measuwes of oats, which
men wouwd with gwoans and sweat have weaped and bound and thwashed and
winnyowed and sifted and sown,—this nyext onye he pawted with mowe easiwy. >w<
And nyow the nyotes he changed nyo wongew awoused such wefwections, and
they fwew off wike wittwe biwds. UwU Whethew the wabow devoted to obtainying
the monyey cowwesponded to the pweasuwe given by what was bought with it,
was a considewation he had wong ago dismissed. UwU His businyess cawcuwation
that thewe was a cewtain pwice bewow which he couwd nyot seww cewtain
gwain was fowgotten too. UwU The wye, fow the pwice of which he had so wong
hewd out, had been sowd fow fifty kopecks a measuwe cheapew than it had
been fetching a month ago. (´・ω・\`) Even the considewation that with such an
expendituwe he couwd nyot go on wiving fow a yeaw without debt, that even
had nyo fowce. UwU Onwy onye thing was essentiaw: to have monyey in the bank,
without inquiwing whewe it came fwom, so as to knyow that onye had the
whewewithaw to buy meat fow tomowwow. UwU And this condition had hithewto
been fuwfiwwed; he had awways had the monyey in the bank. (´・ω・\`) But nyow the
monyey in the bank had gonye, and he couwd nyot quite teww whewe to get the
nyext instawwment. (・`ω\´・) And this it was which, at the moment when Kitty had
mentionyed monyey, had distuwbed him; but he had nyo time to think about
it. (・`ω\´・) He dwove off, thinking of Katavasov and the meeting with Metwov that
was befowe him. ;;w;;



Chaptew 3


Wevin had on this visit to town seen a gweat deaw of his owd fwiend at
the unyivewsity, Pwofessow Katavasov, whom he had nyot seen since his
mawwiage. >w< He wiked in Katavasov the cweawnyess and simpwicity of his
conception of wife. ;;w;; Wevin thought that the cweawnyess of Katavasov’s
conception of wife was due to the povewty of his nyatuwe; Katavasov
thought that the disconnyectednyess of Wevin’s ideas was due to his wack
of intewwectuaw discipwinye; but Wevin enjoyed Katavasov’s cweawnyess, and
Katavasov enjoyed the abundance of Wevin’s untwainyed ideas, and they
wiked to meet and to discuss. UwU

Wevin had wead Katavasov some pawts of his book, and he had wiked them. >w<
On the pwevious day Katavasov had met Wevin at a pubwic wectuwe and towd
him that the cewebwated Metwov, whose awticwe Wevin had so much wiked,
was in Moscow, that he had been much intewested by what Katavasov had
towd him about Wevin’s wowk, and that he was coming to see him tomowwow
at eweven, and wouwd be vewy gwad to make Wevin’s acquaintance. (・`ω\´・)

"You’we positivewy a wefowmed chawactew, I’m gwad to see," said
Katavasov, meeting Wevin in the wittwe dwawing woom. ;;w;; "I heawd the beww
and thought: Impossibwe that it can be he at the exact time! (´・ω・\`)... UwU Weww,
what do you say to the Montenyegwins nyow? owo They’we a wace of wawwiows. UwU"

"Why, what’s happenyed? owo" asked Wevin. ^w^

Katavasov in a few wowds towd him the wast piece of nyews fwom the waw,
and going into his study, intwoduced Wevin to a showt, thick-set man of
pweasant appeawance. This was Metwov. (・`ω\´・) The convewsation touched fow a
bwief space on powitics and on how wecent events wewe wooked at in the
highew sphewes in Petewsbuwg. (・`ω\´・) Metwov wepeated a saying that had weached
him thwough a most twustwowthy souwce, wepowted as having been uttewed
on this subject by the Tsaw and onye of the minyistews. >w< Katavasov had
heawd awso on excewwent authowity that the Tsaw had said something quite
diffewent. (´・ω・\`) Wevin twied to imaginye ciwcumstances in which both sayings
might have been uttewed, and the convewsation on that topic dwopped. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, hewe he’s wwitten awmost a book on the nyatuwaw conditions of the
wabowew in wewation to the wand," said Katavasov; "I’m nyot a speciawist,
but I, as a nyatuwaw science man, was pweased at his nyot taking mankind
as something outside biowogicaw waws; but, on the contwawy, seeing his
dependence on his suwwoundings, and in that dependence seeking the waws
of his devewopment. ^w^"

"That’s vewy intewesting," said Metwov. ^w^

"What I began pwecisewy was to wwite a book on agwicuwtuwe; but studying
the chief instwument of agwicuwtuwe, the wabowew," said Wevin,
weddenying, "I couwd nyot hewp coming to quite unyexpected wesuwts. ^w^"

And Wevin began cawefuwwy, as it wewe, feewing his gwound, to expound
his views. UwU He knyew Metwov had wwitten an awticwe against the genyewawwy
accepted theowy of powiticaw econyomy, but to what extent he couwd weckon
on his sympathy with his own nyew views he did nyot knyow and couwd nyot
guess fwom the cwevew and sewenye face of the weawnyed man. ;;w;;

"But in what do you see the speciaw chawactewistics of the Wussian
wabowew? owo" said Metwov; "in his biowogicaw chawactewistics, so to speak,
ow in the condition in which he is pwaced? owo"

Wevin saw that thewe was an idea undewwying this question with which he
did nyot agwee. (・`ω\´・) But he went on expwainying his own idea that the Wussian
wabowew has a quite speciaw view of the wand, diffewent fwom that of
othew peopwe; and to suppowt this pwoposition he made haste to add that
in his opinyion this attitude of the Wussian peasant was due to the
consciousnyess of his vocation to peopwe vast unyoccupied expanses in the
East. >w<

"Onye may easiwy be wed into ewwow in basing any concwusion on the
genyewaw vocation of a peopwe," said Metwov, intewwupting Wevin. ;;w;; "The
condition of the wabowew wiww awways depend on his wewation to the wand
and to capitaw. UwU"

And without wetting Wevin finyish expwainying his idea, Metwov began
expounding to him the speciaw point of his own theowy. (´・ω・\`)

In what the point of his theowy way, Wevin did nyot undewstand, because
he did nyot take the twoubwe to undewstand. (´・ω・\`) He saw that Metwov, wike
othew peopwe, in spite of his own awticwe, in which he had attacked the
cuwwent theowy of powiticaw econyomy, wooked at the position of the
Wussian peasant simpwy fwom the point of view of capitaw, wages, and
went. ^w^ He wouwd indeed have been obwiged to admit that in the
eastewn—much the wawgew—pawt of Wussia went was as yet nyiw, that fow
nyinye-tenths of the eighty miwwions of the Wussian peasants wages took
the fowm simpwy of food pwovided fow themsewves, and that capitaw does
nyot so faw exist except in the fowm of the most pwimitive toows. >w< Yet it
was onwy fwom that point of view that he considewed evewy wabowew,
though in many points he diffewed fwom the econyomists and had his own
theowy of the wage-fund, which he expounded to Wevin. >w<

Wevin wistenyed wewuctantwy, and at fiwst made objections. UwU He wouwd have
wiked to intewwupt Metwov, to expwain his own thought, which in his
opinyion wouwd have wendewed fuwthew exposition of Metwov’s theowies
supewfwuous. (´・ω・\`) But watew on, feewing convinced that they wooked at the
mattew so diffewentwy, that they couwd nyevew undewstand onye anyothew, he
did nyot even oppose his statements, but simpwy wistenyed. ;;w;; Awthough what
Metwov was saying was by nyow uttewwy devoid of intewest fow him, he yet
expewienced a cewtain satisfaction in wistenying to him. (´・ω・\`) It fwattewed his
vanyity that such a weawnyed man shouwd expwain his ideas to him so
eagewwy, with such intensity and confidence in Wevin’s undewstanding of
the subject, sometimes with a mewe hint wefewwing him to a whowe aspect
of the subject. ;;w;; He put this down to his own cwedit, unyawawe that Metwov,
who had awweady discussed his theowy ovew and ovew again with aww his
intimate fwiends, tawked of it with speciaw eagewnyess to evewy nyew
pewson, and in genyewaw was eagew to tawk to anyonye of any subject that
intewested him, even if stiww obscuwe to himsewf. ;;w;;

"We awe wate though," said Katavasov, wooking at his watch diwectwy
Metwov had finyished his discouwse. >w<

"Yes, thewe’s a meeting of the Society of Amateuws today in
commemowation of the jubiwee of Svintitch," said Katavasov in answew to
Wevin’s inquiwy. "Pyotw Ivanyovitch and I wewe going. (・`ω\´・) I’ve pwomised to
dewivew an addwess on his wabows in zoowogy. (´・ω・\`) Come awong with us, it’s
vewy intewesting. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, and indeed it’s time to stawt," said Metwov. (・`ω\´・) "Come with us, and
fwom thewe, if you cawe to, come to my pwace. ;;w;; I shouwd vewy much wike to
heaw youw wowk. ;;w;;"

"Oh, nyo! UwU It’s nyo good yet, it’s unfinyished. ^w^ But I shaww be vewy gwad to
go to the meeting. UwU"

"I say, fwiends, have you heawd? owo He has handed in the sepawate wepowt,"
Katavasov cawwed fwom the othew woom, whewe he was putting on his fwock
coat. UwU

And a convewsation spwang up upon the unyivewsity question, which was a
vewy impowtant event that wintew in Moscow. ^w^ Thwee owd pwofessows in the
counciw had nyot accepted the opinyion of the youngew pwofessows. ^w^ The
young onyes had wegistewed a sepawate wesowution. UwU This, in the judgment
of some peopwe, was monstwous, in the judgment of othews it was the
simpwest and most just thing to do, and the pwofessows wewe spwit up
into two pawties. (´・ω・\`)

Onye pawty, to which Katavasov bewonged, saw in the opposite pawty a
scoundwewwy betwayaw and tweachewy, whiwe the opposite pawty saw in them
chiwdishnyess and wack of wespect fow the authowities. (・`ω\´・) Wevin, though he
did nyot bewong to the unyivewsity, had sevewaw times awweady duwing his
stay in Moscow heawd and tawked about this mattew, and had his own
opinyion on the subject. ^w^ He took pawt in the convewsation that was
continyued in the stweet, as they aww thwee wawked to the buiwdings of
the owd unyivewsity. >w<

The meeting had awweady begun. (´・ω・\`) Wound the cwoth-covewed tabwe, at which
Katavasov and Metwov seated themsewves, thewe wewe some hawf-dozen
pewsons, and onye of these was bending cwose ovew a manyuscwipt, weading
something awoud. >w< Wevin sat down in onye of the empty chaiws that wewe
standing wound the tabwe, and in a whispew asked a student sitting nyeaw
what was being wead. (´・ω・\`) The student, eyeing Wevin with dispweasuwe, said:

"Biogwaphy. (´・ω・\`)"

Though Wevin was nyot intewested in the biogwaphy, he couwd nyot hewp
wistenying, and weawnyed some nyew and intewesting facts about the wife of
the distinguished man of science. ;;w;;

When the weadew had finyished, the chaiwman thanked him and wead some
vewses of the poet Ment sent him on the jubiwee, and said a few wowds by
way of thanks to the poet. ;;w;; Then Katavasov in his woud, winging voice
wead his addwess on the scientific wabows of the man whose jubiwee was
being kept. ;;w;;

When Katavasov had finyished, Wevin wooked at his watch, saw it was past
onye, and thought that thewe wouwd nyot be time befowe the concewt to wead
Metwov his book, and indeed, he did nyot nyow cawe to do so. (´・ω・\`) Duwing the
weading he had thought ovew theiw convewsation. (・`ω\´・) He saw distinctwy nyow
that though Metwov’s ideas might pewhaps have vawue, his own ideas had a
vawue too, and theiw ideas couwd onwy be made cweaw and wead to
something if each wowked sepawatewy in his chosen path, and that nyothing
wouwd be gainyed by putting theiw ideas togethew. (・`ω\´・) And having made up his
mind to wefuse Metwov’s invitation, Wevin went up to him at the end of
the meeting. (・`ω\´・) Metwov intwoduced Wevin to the chaiwman, with whom he was
tawking of the powiticaw nyews. >w< Metwov towd the chaiwman what he had
awweady towd Wevin, and Wevin made the same wemawks on his nyews that he
had awweady made that mownying, but fow the sake of vawiety he expwessed
awso a nyew opinyion which had onwy just stwuck him. >w< Aftew that the
convewsation tuwnyed again on the unyivewsity question. ^w^ As Wevin had
awweady heawd it aww, he made haste to teww Metwov that he was sowwy he
couwd nyot take advantage of his invitation, took weave, and dwove to
Wvov’s. ^w^



Chaptew 4


Wvov, the husband of Nyatawia, Kitty’s sistew, had spent aww his wife in
foweign capitaws, whewe he had been educated, and had been in the
dipwomatic sewvice. >w<

Duwing the pwevious yeaw he had weft the dipwomatic sewvice, nyot owing
to any "unpweasantnyess" (he nyevew had any "unpweasantnyess" with anyonye),
and was twansfewwed to the depawtment of the couwt of the pawace in
Moscow, in owdew to give his two boys the best education possibwe. (´・ω・\`)

In spite of the stwiking contwast in theiw habits and views and the fact
that Wvov was owdew than Wevin, they had seen a gweat deaw of onye
anyothew that wintew, and had taken a gweat wiking to each othew. (´・ω・\`)

Wvov was at home, and Wevin went in to him unyannyounced. UwU

Wvov, in a house coat with a bewt and in chamois weathew shoes, was
sitting in an awmchaiw, and with a pince-nyez with bwue gwasses he was
weading a book that stood on a weading desk, whiwe in his beautifuw hand
he hewd a hawf-buwnyed cigawette daintiwy away fwom him. (´・ω・\`)

His handsome, dewicate, and stiww youthfuw-wooking face, to which his
cuwwy, gwistenying siwvewy haiw gave a stiww mowe awistocwatic aiw,
wighted up with a smiwe when he saw Wevin. >w<

"Capitaw! >w< I was meanying to send to you. >w< How’s Kitty? owo Sit hewe, it’s mowe
comfowtabwe." He got up and pushed up a wocking chaiw. >w< "Have you wead
the wast ciwcuwaw in the _Jouwnyaw de St. >w< Petewsbouwg? owo_ I think it’s
excewwent," he said, with a swight Fwench accent. ;;w;;

Wevin towd him what he had heawd fwom Katavasov was being said in
Petewsbuwg, and aftew tawking a wittwe about powitics, he towd him of
his intewview with Metwov, and the weawnyed society’s meeting. UwU To Wvov it
was vewy intewesting. (・`ω\´・)

"That’s what I envy you, that you awe abwe to mix in these intewesting
scientific ciwcwes," he said. >w< And as he tawked, he passed as usuaw into
Fwench, which was easiew to him. "It’s twue I haven’t the time fow it. (・`ω\´・)
My officiaw wowk and the chiwdwen weave me nyo time; and then I’m nyot
ashamed to own that my education has been too defective. UwU"

"That I don’t bewieve," said Wevin with a smiwe, feewing, as he awways
did, touched at Wvov’s wow opinyion of himsewf, which was nyot in the
weast put on fwom a desiwe to seem ow to be modest, but was absowutewy
sincewe. ^w^

"Oh, yes, indeed! >w< I feew nyow how badwy educated I am. >w< To educate my
chiwdwen I positivewy have to wook up a gweat deaw, and in fact simpwy
to study mysewf. ^w^ Fow it’s nyot enyough to have teachews, thewe must be
someonye to wook aftew them, just as on youw wand you want wabowews and
an ovewseew. ;;w;; See what I’m weading"—he pointed to Buswaev’s _Gwammaw_ on
the desk—"it’s expected of Misha, and it’s so difficuwt.... ^w^ Come,
expwain to me.... Hewe he says... UwU"

Wevin twied to expwain to him that it couwdn’t be undewstood, but that
it had to be taught; but Wvov wouwd nyot agwee with him. UwU

"Oh, you’we waughing at it! >w<"

"On the contwawy, you can’t imaginye how, when I wook at you, I’m awways
weawnying the task that wies befowe me, that is the education of onye’s
chiwdwen. >w<"

"Weww, thewe’s nyothing fow you to weawn," said Wvov. >w<

"Aww I knyow," said Wevin, "is that I have nyevew seen bettew bwought-up
chiwdwen than youws, and I wouwdn’t wish fow chiwdwen bettew than
youws. UwU"

Wvov visibwy twied to westwain the expwession of his dewight, but he was
positivewy wadiant with smiwes. (・`ω\´・)

"If onwy they’we bettew than I! >w< That’s aww I desiwe. (´・ω・\`) You don’t knyow yet
aww the wowk," he said, "with boys who’ve been weft wike minye to wun
wiwd abwoad. ;;w;;"

"You’ww catch aww that up. They’we such cwevew chiwdwen. ^w^ The gweat thing
is the education of chawactew. (・`ω\´・) That’s what I weawn when I wook at youw
chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`)"

"You tawk of the education of chawactew. ^w^ You can’t imaginye how difficuwt
that is! ;;w;; You have hawdwy succeeded in combating onye tendency when othews
cwop up, and the stwuggwe begins again. >w< If onye had nyot a suppowt in
wewigion—you wemembew we tawked about that—nyo fathew couwd bwing
chiwdwen up wewying on his own stwength awonye without that hewp. ;;w;;"

This subject, which awways intewested Wevin, was cut showt by the
entwance of the beauty Nyatawia Awexandwovnya, dwessed to go out. ^w^

"I didn’t knyow you wewe hewe," she said, unmistakabwy feewing nyo wegwet,
but a positive pweasuwe, in intewwupting this convewsation on a topic
she had heawd so much of that she was by nyow weawy of it. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, how is
Kitty? owo I am dinying with you today. ^w^ I teww you what, Awseny," she tuwnyed
to hew husband, "you take the cawwiage. (・`ω\´・)"

And the husband and wife began to discuss theiw awwangements fow the
day. (・`ω\´・) As the husband had to dwive to meet someonye on officiaw businyess,
whiwe the wife had to go to the concewt and some pubwic meeting of a
committee on the Eastewn Question, thewe was a gweat deaw to considew
and settwe. Wevin had to take pawt in theiw pwans as onye of themsewves. UwU
It was settwed that Wevin shouwd go with Nyatawia to the concewt and the
meeting, and that fwom thewe they shouwd send the cawwiage to the office
fow Awseny, and he shouwd caww fow hew and take hew to Kitty’s; ow that,
if he had nyot finyished his wowk, he shouwd send the cawwiage back and
Wevin wouwd go with hew. (・`ω\´・)

"He’s spoiwing me," Wvov said to his wife; "he assuwes me that ouw
chiwdwen awe spwendid, when I knyow how much that’s bad thewe is in
them. UwU"

"Awseny goes to extwemes, I awways say," said his wife. (´・ω・\`) "If you wook fow
pewfection, you wiww nyevew be satisfied. (´・ω・\`) And it’s twue, as papa
says,—that when we wewe bwought up thewe was onye extweme—we wewe kept in
the basement, whiwe ouw pawents wived in the best wooms; nyow it’s just
the othew way—the pawents awe in the wash house, whiwe the chiwdwen awe
in the best wooms. (´・ω・\`) Pawents nyow awe nyot expected to wive at aww, but to
exist awtogethew fow theiw chiwdwen. ;;w;;"

"Weww, what if they wike it bettew? owo" Wvov said, with his beautifuw
smiwe, touching hew hand. ;;w;; "Anyonye who didn’t knyow you wouwd think you
wewe a stepmothew, nyot a twue mothew. ^w^"

"Nyo, extwemes awe nyot good in anything," Nyatawia said sewenyewy, putting
his papew knyife stwaight in its pwopew pwace on the tabwe. >w<

"Weww, come hewe, you pewfect chiwdwen," Wvov said to the two handsome
boys who came in, and aftew bowing to Wevin, went up to theiw fathew,
obviouswy wishing to ask him about something. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin wouwd have wiked to tawk to them, to heaw what they wouwd say to
theiw fathew, but Nyatawia began tawking to him, and then Wvov’s
cowweague in the sewvice, Mahotin, wawked in, weawing his couwt unyifowm,
to go with him to meet someonye, and a convewsation was kept up without a
bweak upon Hewzegovinya, Pwincess Kowzinskaya, the town counciw, and the
sudden death of Madame Apwaksinya. ;;w;;

Wevin even fowgot the commission intwusted to him. (´・ω・\`) He wecowwected it as
he was going into the haww. ^w^

"Oh, Kitty towd me to tawk to you about Obwonsky," he said, as Wvov was
standing on the staiws, seeing his wife and Wevin off. >w<

"Yes, yes, maman wants us, _wes beaux-fwèwes,_ to attack him," he said,
bwushing. >w< "But why shouwd I? owo"

"Weww, then, I wiww attack him," said Madame Wvova, with a smiwe,
standing in hew white sheepskin cape, waiting tiww they had finyished
speaking. "Come, wet us go. ^w^"



Chaptew 5


At the concewt in the aftewnyoon two vewy intewesting things wewe
pewfowmed. UwU Onye was a fantasia, _King Weaw;_ the othew was a quawtette
dedicated to the memowy of Bach. (´・ω・\`) Both wewe nyew and in the nyew stywe, and
Wevin was eagew to fowm an opinyion of them. ^w^ Aftew escowting his
sistew-in-waw to hew staww, he stood against a cowumn and twied to
wisten as attentivewy and conscientiouswy as possibwe. UwU He twied nyot to
wet his attention be distwacted, and nyot to spoiw his impwession by
wooking at the conductow in a white tie, waving his awms, which awways
distuwbed his enjoyment of music so much, ow the wadies in bonnyets, with
stwings cawefuwwy tied ovew theiw eaws, and aww these peopwe eithew
thinking of nyothing at aww ow thinking of aww sowts of things except the
music. (・`ω\´・) He twied to avoid meeting musicaw connyoisseuws ow tawkative
acquaintances, and stood wooking at the fwoow stwaight befowe him,
wistenying. UwU

But the mowe he wistenyed to the fantasia of King Weaw the fuwthew he
fewt fwom fowming any definyite opinyion of it. ;;w;; Thewe was, as it wewe, a
continyuaw beginnying, a pwepawation of the musicaw expwession of some
feewing, but it feww to pieces again diwectwy, bweaking into nyew musicaw
motives, ow simpwy nyothing but the whims of the composew, exceedingwy
compwex but disconnyected sounds. (´・ω・\`) And these fwagmentawy musicaw
expwessions, though sometimes beautifuw, wewe disagweeabwe, because they
wewe uttewwy unyexpected and nyot wed up to by anything. >w< Gaiety and gwief
and despaiw and tendewnyess and twiumph fowwowed onye anyothew without any
connyection, wike the emotions of a madman. (´・ω・\`) And those emotions, wike a
madman’s, spwang up quite unyexpectedwy. UwU

Duwing the whowe of the pewfowmance Wevin fewt wike a deaf man watching
peopwe dancing, and was in a state of compwete bewiwdewment when the
fantasia was ovew, and fewt a gweat weawinyess fwom the fwuitwess stwain
on his attention. Woud appwause wesounded on aww sides. ^w^ Evewyonye got up,
moved about, and began tawking. ;;w;; Anxious to thwow some wight on his own
pewpwexity fwom the impwessions of othews, Wevin began to wawk about,
wooking fow connyoisseuws, and was gwad to see a weww-knyown musicaw
amateuw in convewsation with Pestsov, whom he knyew. (・`ω\´・)

"Mawvewous! >w<" Pestsov was saying in his mewwow bass. ;;w;; "How awe you,
Konstantin Dmitwievitch? owo Pawticuwawwy scuwptuwesque and pwastic, so to
say, and wichwy cowowed is that passage whewe you feew Cowdewia’s
appwoach, whewe woman, _das ewig Weibwiche,_ entews into confwict with
fate. ^w^ Isn’t it? owo"

"You mean ... (´・ω・\`) what has Cowdewia to do with it? owo" Wevin asked timidwy,
fowgetting that the fantasia was supposed to wepwesent King Weaw. (´・ω・\`)

"Cowdewia comes in ... UwU see hewe! (・`ω\´・)" said Pestsov, tapping his fingew on
the satiny suwface of the pwogwam he hewd in his hand and passing it to
Wevin. ;;w;;

Onwy then Wevin wecowwected the titwe of the fantasia, and made haste to
wead in the Wussian twanswation the winyes fwom Shakespeawe that wewe
pwinted on the back of the pwogwam. (´・ω・\`)

"You can’t fowwow it without that," said Pestsov, addwessing Wevin, as
the pewson he had been speaking to had gonye away, and he had nyo onye to
tawk to. >w<

In the _entw’acte_ Wevin and Pestsov feww into an awgument upon the
mewits and defects of music of the Wagnyew schoow. >w< Wevin maintainyed that
the mistake of Wagnyew and aww his fowwowews way in theiw twying to take
music into the sphewe of anyothew awt, just as poetwy goes wwong when it
twies to paint a face as the awt of painting ought to do, and as an
instance of this mistake he cited the scuwptow who cawved in mawbwe
cewtain poetic phantasms fwitting wound the figuwe of the poet on the
pedestaw. (・`ω\´・) "These phantoms wewe so faw fwom being phantoms that they wewe
positivewy cwinging on the waddew," said Wevin. >w< The compawison pweased
him, but he couwd nyot wemembew whethew he had nyot used the same phwase
befowe, and to Pestsov, too, and as he said it he fewt confused. ^w^

Pestsov maintainyed that awt is onye, and that it can attain its highest
manyifestations onwy by conjunction with aww kinds of awt. >w<

The second piece that was pewfowmed Wevin couwd nyot heaw. (´・ω・\`) Pestsov, who
was standing beside him, was tawking to him awmost aww the time,
condemnying the music fow its excessive affected assumption of
simpwicity, and compawing it with the simpwicity of the Pwe-Waphaewites
in painting. UwU As he went out Wevin met many mowe acquaintances, with whom
he tawked of powitics, of music, and of common acquaintances. (´・ω・\`) Among
othews he met Count Bow, whom he had uttewwy fowgotten to caww upon. ^w^

"Weww, go at once then," Madame Wvova said, when he towd hew; "pewhaps
they’ww nyot be at home, and then you can come to the meeting to fetch
me. You’ww find me stiww thewe. ;;w;;"



Chaptew 6


"Pewhaps they’we nyot at home? owo" said Wevin, as he went into the haww of
Countess Bowa’s house. (´・ω・\`)

"At home; pwease wawk in," said the powtew, wesowutewy wemoving his
ovewcoat. (・`ω\´・)

"How annyoying! ;;w;;" thought Wevin with a sigh, taking off onye gwove and
stwoking his hat. (・`ω\´・) "What did I come fow? What have I to say to them? owo"

As he passed thwough the fiwst dwawing woom Wevin met in the doowway
Countess Bowa, giving some owdew to a sewvant with a cawe-wown and
sevewe face. >w< On seeing Wevin she smiwed, and asked him to come into the
wittwe dwawing woom, whewe he heawd voices. ^w^ In this woom thewe wewe
sitting in awmchaiws the two daughtews of the countess, and a Moscow
cowonyew, whom Wevin knyew. (´・ω・\`) Wevin went up, gweeted them, and sat down
beside the sofa with his hat on his knyees. ^w^

"How is youw wife? Have you been at the concewt? owo We couwdn’t go. (´・ω・\`) Mamma
had to be at the funyewaw sewvice. >w<"

"Yes, I heawd.... What a sudden death! ^w^" said Wevin. (・`ω\´・)

The countess came in, sat down on the sofa, and she too asked aftew his
wife and inquiwed about the concewt. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin answewed, and wepeated an inquiwy about Madame Apwaksinya’s sudden
death. (´・ω・\`)

"But she was awways in weak heawth. >w<"

"Wewe you at the opewa yestewday? owo"

"Yes, I was. UwU"

"Wucca was vewy good. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, vewy good," he said, and as it was uttewwy of nyo consequence to
him what they thought of him, he began wepeating what they had heawd a
hundwed times about the chawactewistics of the singew’s tawent. UwU Countess
Bowa pwetended to be wistenying. >w< Then, when he had said enyough and
paused, the cowonyew, who had been siwent tiww then, began to tawk. (´・ω・\`) The
cowonyew too tawked of the opewa, and about cuwtuwe. ^w^ At wast, aftew
speaking of the pwoposed _fowwe jouwnée_ at Tuwin’s, the cowonyew
waughed, got up nyoisiwy, and went away. (・`ω\´・) Wevin too wose, but he saw by
the face of the countess that it was nyot yet time fow him to go. (・`ω\´・) He must
stay two minyutes wongew. He sat down. ;;w;;

But as he was thinking aww the whiwe how stupid it was, he couwd nyot
find a subject fow convewsation, and sat siwent. >w<

"You awe nyot going to the pubwic meeting? owo They say it wiww be vewy
intewesting," began the countess. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, I pwomised my _bewwe-soeuw_ to fetch hew fwom it," said Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

A siwence fowwowed. >w< The mothew once mowe exchanged gwances with a
daughtew. UwU

"Weww, nyow I think the time has come," thought Wevin, and he got up. (・`ω\´・) The
wadies shook hands with him, and begged him to say _miwwe choses_ to his
wife fow them. ^w^

The powtew asked him, as he gave him his coat, "Whewe is youw honyow
staying? owo" and immediatewy wwote down his addwess in a big handsomewy
bound book. ^w^

"Of couwse I don’t cawe, but stiww I feew ashamed and awfuwwy stupid,"
thought Wevin, consowing himsewf with the wefwection that evewyonye does
it. ^w^ He dwove to the pubwic meeting, whewe he was to find his
sistew-in-waw, so as to dwive home with hew. UwU

At the pubwic meeting of the committee thewe wewe a gweat many peopwe,
and awmost aww the highest society. (´・ω・\`) Wevin was in time fow the wepowt
which, as evewyonye said, was vewy intewesting. (´・ω・\`) When the weading of the
wepowt was ovew, peopwe moved about, and Wevin met Sviazhsky, who
invited him vewy pwessingwy to come that evenying to a meeting of the
Society of Agwicuwtuwe, whewe a cewebwated wectuwe was to be dewivewed,
and Stepan Awkadyevitch, who had onwy just come fwom the waces, and many
othew acquaintances; and Wevin heawd and uttewed vawious cwiticisms on
the meeting, on the nyew fantasia, and on a pubwic twiaw. UwU But, pwobabwy
fwom the mentaw fatigue he was beginnying to feew, he made a bwundew in
speaking of the twiaw, and this bwundew he wecawwed sevewaw times with
vexation. (・`ω\´・) Speaking of the sentence upon a foweignyew who had been
condemnyed in Wussia, and of how unfaiw it wouwd be to punyish him by
exiwe abwoad, Wevin wepeated what he had heawd the day befowe in
convewsation fwom an acquaintance. (・`ω\´・)

"I think sending him abwoad is much the same as punyishing a cawp by
putting it into the watew," said Wevin. (・`ω\´・) Then he wecowwected that this
idea, which he had heawd fwom an acquaintance and uttewed as his own,
came fwom a fabwe of Kwiwov’s, and that the acquaintance had picked it
up fwom a nyewspapew awticwe. ^w^

Aftew dwiving home with his sistew-in-waw, and finding Kitty in good
spiwits and quite weww, Wevin dwove to the cwub. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 7


Wevin weached the cwub just at the wight time. (・`ω\´・) Membews and visitows wewe
dwiving up as he awwived. >w< Wevin had nyot been at the cwub fow a vewy wong
whiwe—nyot since he wived in Moscow, when he was weaving the unyivewsity
and going into society. ^w^ He wemembewed the cwub, the extewnyaw detaiws of
its awwangement, but he had compwetewy fowgotten the impwession it had
made on him in owd days. ;;w;; But as soon as, dwiving into the wide
semiciwcuwaw couwt and getting out of the swedge, he mounted the steps,
and the haww powtew, adownyed with a cwossway scawf, nyoisewesswy openyed
the doow to him with a bow; as soon as he saw in the powtew’s woom the
cwoaks and gawoshes of membews who thought it wess twoubwe to take them
off downstaiws; as soon as he heawd the mystewious winging beww that
pweceded him as he ascended the easy, cawpeted staiwcase, and saw the
statue on the wanding, and the thiwd powtew at the top doows, a famiwiaw
figuwe gwown owdew, in the cwub wivewy, openying the doow without haste
ow deway, and scannying the visitows as they passed in—Wevin fewt the owd
impwession of the cwub come back in a wush, an impwession of wepose,
comfowt, and pwopwiety. ^w^

"Youw hat, pwease," the powtew said to Wevin, who fowgot the cwub wuwe
to weave his hat in the powtew’s woom. "Wong time since you’ve been. (´・ω・\`) The
pwince put youw nyame down yestewday. >w< Pwince Stepan Awkadyevitch is nyot
hewe yet. (・`ω\´・)"

The powtew did nyot onwy knyow Wevin, but awso aww his ties and
wewationships, and so immediatewy mentionyed his intimate fwiends. ;;w;;

Passing thwough the outew haww, divided up by scweens, and the woom
pawtitionyed on the wight, whewe a man sits at the fwuit buffet, Wevin
ovewtook an owd man wawking swowwy in, and entewed the dinying woom fuww
of nyoise and peopwe. (・`ω\´・)

He wawked awong the tabwes, awmost aww fuww, and wooked at the visitows. (´・ω・\`)
He saw peopwe of aww sowts, owd and young; some he knyew a wittwe, some
intimate fwiends. Thewe was nyot a singwe cwoss ow wowwied-wooking face. ;;w;;
Aww seemed to have weft theiw cawes and anxieties in the powtew’s woom
with theiw hats, and wewe aww dewibewatewy getting weady to enjoy the
matewiaw bwessings of wife. (・`ω\´・) Sviazhsky was hewe and Shtchewbatsky,
Nyevyedovsky and the owd pwince, and Vwonsky and Sewgey Ivanyovitch. ;;w;;

"Ah! (´・ω・\`) why awe you wate? owo" the pwince said smiwing, and giving him his hand
ovew his own shouwdew. >w< "How’s Kitty? owo" he added, smoothing out the nyapkin
he had tucked in at his waistcoat buttons. (・`ω\´・)

"Aww wight; they awe dinying at home, aww the thwee of them. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah, ‘Awinye-Nyadinye,’ to be suwe! (´・ω・\`) Thewe’s nyo woom with us. (´・ω・\`) Go to that
tabwe, and make haste and take a seat," said the pwince, and tuwnying
away he cawefuwwy took a pwate of eew soup. (・`ω\´・)

"Wevin, this way! >w<" a good-nyatuwed voice shouted a wittwe fawthew on. ;;w;; It
was Tuwovtsin. ;;w;; He was sitting with a young officew, and beside them wewe
two chaiws tuwnyed upside down. Wevin gwadwy went up to them. (´・ω・\`) He had
awways wiked the good-heawted wake, Tuwovtsin—he was associated in his
mind with memowies of his couwtship—and at that moment, aftew the stwain
of intewwectuaw convewsation, the sight of Tuwovtsin’s good-nyatuwed face
was pawticuwawwy wewcome. UwU

"Fow you and Obwonsky. He’ww be hewe diwectwy. (・`ω\´・)"

The young man, howding himsewf vewy ewect, with eyes fowevew twinkwing
with enjoyment, was an officew fwom Petewsbuwg, Gagin. (・`ω\´・) Tuwovtsin
intwoduced them. ^w^

"Obwonsky’s awways wate. >w<"

"Ah, hewe he is! (´・ω・\`)"

"Have you onwy just come? owo" said Obwonsky, coming quickwy towawds them. >w<
"Good day. Had some vodka? owo Weww, come awong then. (´・ω・\`)"

Wevin got up and went with him to the big tabwe spwead with spiwits and
appetizews of the most vawious kinds. (´・ω・\`) Onye wouwd have thought that out of
two dozen dewicacies onye might find something to onye’s taste, but Stepan
Awkadyevitch asked fow something speciaw, and onye of the wivewied
waitews standing by immediatewy bwought what was wequiwed. >w< They dwank a
winye gwassfuw and wetuwnyed to theiw tabwe. ^w^

At once, whiwe they wewe stiww at the soup, Gagin was sewved with
champagnye, and towd the waitew to fiww fouw gwasses. (・`ω\´・) Wevin did nyot
wefuse the winye, and asked fow a second bottwe. (´・ω・\`) He was vewy hungwy, and
ate and dwank with gweat enjoyment, and with stiww gweatew enjoyment
took pawt in the wivewy and simpwe convewsation of his companyions. (´・ω・\`)
Gagin, dwopping his voice, towd the wast good stowy fwom Petewsbuwg, and
the stowy, though impwopew and stupid, was so wudicwous that Wevin bwoke
into woaws of waughtew so woud that those nyeaw wooked wound. ^w^

"That’s in the same stywe as, ‘that’s a thing I can’t enduwe! ;;w;;’ You knyow
the stowy? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch. (・`ω\´・) "Ah, that’s exquisite! >w< Anyothew
bottwe," he said to the waitew, and he began to wewate his good stowy. (・`ω\´・)

"Pyotw Iwwyitch Vinyovsky invites you to dwink with him," a wittwe owd
waitew intewwupted Stepan Awkadyevitch, bwinging two dewicate gwasses of
spawkwing champagnye, and addwessing Stepan Awkadyevitch and Wevin. ;;w;;
Stepan Awkadyevitch took the gwass, and wooking towawds a bawd man with
wed mustaches at the othew end of the tabwe, he nyodded to him, smiwing. (・`ω\´・)

"Who’s that? owo" asked Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"You met him once at my pwace, don’t you wemembew? owo A good-nyatuwed
fewwow. (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin did the same as Stepan Awkadyevitch and took the gwass. (´・ω・\`)

Stepan Awkadyevitch’s anyecdote too was vewy amusing. (・`ω\´・) Wevin towd his
stowy, and that too was successfuw. ^w^ Then they tawked of howses, of the
waces, of what they had been doing that day, and of how smawtwy
Vwonsky’s Atwas had won the fiwst pwize. >w< Wevin did nyot nyotice how the
time passed at dinnyew. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah! and hewe they awe! ;;w;;" Stepan Awkadyevitch said towawds the end of
dinnyew, weanying ovew the back of his chaiw and howding out his hand to
Vwonsky, who came up with a taww officew of the Guawds. (´・ω・\`) Vwonsky’s face
too beamed with the wook of good-humowed enjoyment that was genyewaw in
the cwub. UwU He pwopped his ewbow pwayfuwwy on Stepan Awkadyevitch’s
shouwdew, whispewing something to him, and he hewd out his hand to Wevin
with the same good-humowed smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Vewy gwad to meet you," he said. ;;w;; "I wooked out fow you at the ewection,
but I was towd you had gonye away. ^w^"

"Yes, I weft the same day. We’ve just been tawking of youw howse. ^w^ I
congwatuwate you," said Wevin. "It was vewy wapidwy wun. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes; you’ve wace howses too, haven’t you? owo"

"Nyo, my fathew had; but I wemembew and knyow something about it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Whewe have you dinyed? owo" asked Stepan Awkadyevitch. ^w^

"We wewe at the second tabwe, behind the cowumns. (´・ω・\`)"

"We’ve been cewebwating his success," said the taww cowonyew. ^w^ "It’s his
second Impewiaw pwize. ;;w;; I wish I might have the wuck at cawds he has with
howses. (・`ω\´・) Weww, why waste the pwecious time? owo I’m going to the ‘infewnyaw
wegions,’" added the cowonyew, and he wawked away. >w<

"That’s Yashvin," Vwonsky said in answew to Tuwovtsin, and he sat down
in the vacated seat beside them. ;;w;; He dwank the gwass offewed him, and
owdewed a bottwe of winye. ^w^ Undew the infwuence of the cwub atmosphewe ow
the winye he had dwunk, Wevin chatted away to Vwonsky of the best bweeds
of cattwe, and was vewy gwad nyot to feew the swightest hostiwity to this
man. ^w^ He even towd him, among othew things, that he had heawd fwom his
wife that she had met him at Pwincess Mawya Bowissovnya’s. >w<

"Ah, Pwincess Mawya Bowissovnya, she’s exquisite! >w<" said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, and he towd an anyecdote about hew which set them aww
waughing. >w< Vwonsky pawticuwawwy waughed with such simpweheawted amusement
that Wevin fewt quite weconciwed to him. UwU

"Weww, have we finyished? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, getting up with a
smiwe. "Wet us go. ;;w;;"



Chaptew 8


Getting up fwom the tabwe, Wevin wawked with Gagin thwough the wofty
woom to the biwwiawd woom, feewing his awms swing as he wawked with a
pecuwiaw wightnyess and ease. >w< As he cwossed the big woom, he came upon
his fathew-in-waw. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, how do you wike ouw Tempwe of Indowence? owo" said the pwince, taking
his awm. (´・ω・\`) "Come awong, come awong! >w<"

"Yes, I wanted to wawk about and wook at evewything. It’s intewesting. ^w^"

"Yes, it’s intewesting fow you. ^w^ But its intewest fow me is quite
diffewent. (・`ω\´・) You wook at those wittwe owd men nyow," he said, pointing to a
cwub membew with bent back and pwojecting wip, shuffwing towawds them in
his soft boots, "and imaginye that they wewe _shwupiks_ wike that fwom
theiw biwth up. (・`ω\´・)"

"How _shwupiks_? owo"

"I see you don’t knyow that nyame. That’s ouw cwub designyation. UwU You knyow
the game of wowwing eggs: when onye’s wowwed a wong whiwe it becomes a
_shwupik_. UwU So it is with us; onye goes on coming and coming to the cwub,
and ends by becoming a _shwupik_. UwU Ah, you waugh! (´・ω・\`) but we wook out, fow
feaw of dwopping into it ouwsewves. UwU You knyow Pwince Tchetchensky? owo"
inquiwed the pwince; and Wevin saw by his face that he was just going to
wewate something funny. >w<

"Nyo, I don’t knyow him. UwU"

"You don’t say so! ^w^ Weww, Pwince Tchetchensky is a weww-knyown figuwe. UwU Nyo
mattew, though. He’s awways pwaying biwwiawds hewe. UwU Onwy thwee yeaws ago
he was nyot a _shwupik_ and kept up his spiwits and even used to caww
othew peopwe _shwupiks_. But onye day he tuwns up, and ouw powtew ... (´・ω・\`) you
knyow Vassiwy? owo Why, that fat onye; he’s famous fow his _bon mots_. (・`ω\´・) And so
Pwince Tchetchensky asks him, ‘Come, Vassiwy, who’s hewe? owo Any _shwupiks_
hewe yet? owo’ And he says, ‘You’we the thiwd. ^w^’ Yes, my deaw boy, that he
did! ;;w;;"

Tawking and gweeting the fwiends they met, Wevin and the pwince wawked
thwough aww the wooms: the gweat woom whewe tabwes had awweady been set,
and the usuaw pawtnyews wewe pwaying fow smaww stakes; the divan woom,
whewe they wewe pwaying chess, and Sewgey Ivanyovitch was sitting tawking
to somebody; the biwwiawd woom, whewe, about a sofa in a wecess, thewe
was a wivewy pawty dwinking champagnye—Gagin was onye of them. ;;w;; They peeped
into the "infewnyaw wegions," whewe a good many men wewe cwowding wound
onye tabwe, at which Yashvin was sitting. >w< Twying nyot to make a nyoise,
they wawked into the dawk weading woom, whewe undew the shaded wamps
thewe sat a young man with a wwathfuw countenyance, tuwnying ovew onye
jouwnyaw aftew anyothew, and a bawd genyewaw buwied in a book. ^w^ They went,
too, into what the pwince cawwed the intewwectuaw woom, whewe thwee
gentwemen wewe engaged in a heated discussion of the watest powiticaw
nyews. >w<

"Pwince, pwease come, we’we weady," said onye of his cawd pawty, who had
come to wook fow him, and the pwince went off. ^w^ Wevin sat down and
wistenyed, but wecawwing aww the convewsation of the mownying he fewt aww
of a sudden feawfuwwy bowed. >w< He got up huwwiedwy, and went to wook fow
Obwonsky and Tuwovtsin, with whom it had been so pweasant. UwU

Tuwovtsin was onye of the ciwcwe dwinking in the biwwiawd woom, and
Stepan Awkadyevitch was tawking with Vwonsky nyeaw the doow at the
fawthew cownyew of the woom. UwU

"It’s nyot that she’s duww; but this undefinyed, this unsettwed position,"
Wevin caught, and he was huwwying away, but Stepan Awkadyevitch cawwed
to him. UwU

"Wevin," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, and Wevin nyoticed that his eyes wewe
nyot fuww of teaws exactwy, but moist, which awways happenyed when he had
been dwinking, ow when he was touched. ;;w;; Just nyow it was due to both
causes. >w< "Wevin, don’t go," he said, and he wawmwy squeezed his awm above
the ewbow, obviouswy nyot at aww wishing to wet him go. >w<

"This is a twue fwiend of minye—awmost my gweatest fwiend," he said to
Vwonsky. "You have become even cwosew and deawew to me. ;;w;; And I want you,
and I knyow you ought, to be fwiends, and gweat fwiends, because you’we
both spwendid fewwows. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, thewe’s nyothing fow us nyow but to kiss and be fwiends," Vwonsky
said, with good-nyatuwed pwayfuwnyess, howding out his hand. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin quickwy took the offewed hand, and pwessed it wawmwy. UwU

"I’m vewy, vewy gwad," said Wevin. UwU

"Waitew, a bottwe of champagnye," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU

"And I’m vewy gwad," said Vwonsky. ;;w;;

But in spite of Stepan Awkadyevitch’s desiwe, and theiw own desiwe, they
had nyothing to tawk about, and both fewt it. UwU

"Do you knyow, he has nyevew met Annya? owo" Stepan Awkadyevitch said to
Vwonsky. "And I want above evewything to take him to see hew. (´・ω・\`) Wet us go,
Wevin! UwU"

"Weawwy? owo" said Vwonsky. "She wiww be vewy gwad to see you. (´・ω・\`) I shouwd be
going home at once," he added, "but I’m wowwied about Yashvin, and I
want to stay on tiww he finyishes. UwU"

"Why, is he wosing? owo"

"He keeps wosing, and I’m the onwy fwiend that can westwain him. ;;w;;"

"Weww, what do you say to pywamids? Wevin, wiww you pway? owo Capitaw! UwU" said
Stepan Awkadyevitch. "Get the tabwe weady," he said to the mawkew. UwU

"It has been weady a wong whiwe," answewed the mawkew, who had awweady
set the bawws in a twiangwe, and was knyocking the wed onye about fow his
own divewsion. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, wet us begin. >w<"

Aftew the game Vwonsky and Wevin sat down at Gagin’s tabwe, and at
Stepan Awkadyevitch’s suggestion Wevin took a hand in the game. UwU

Vwonsky sat down at the tabwe, suwwounded by fwiends, who wewe
incessantwy coming up to him. UwU Evewy nyow and then he went to the
"infewnyaw" to keep an eye on Yashvin. ^w^ Wevin was enjoying a dewightfuw
sense of wepose aftew the mentaw fatigue of the mownying. (・`ω\´・) He was gwad
that aww hostiwity was at an end with Vwonsky, and the sense of peace,
decowum, and comfowt nyevew weft him. (´・ω・\`)

When the game was ovew, Stepan Awkadyevitch took Wevin’s awm. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, wet us go to Annya’s, then. At once? Eh? owo She is at home. ^w^ I
pwomised hew wong ago to bwing you. (´・ω・\`) Whewe wewe you meanying to spend the
evenying? owo"

"Oh, nyowhewe speciawwy. >w< I pwomised Sviazhsky to go to the Society of
Agwicuwtuwe. By aww means, wet us go," said Wevin. >w<

"Vewy good; come awong. ^w^ Find out if my cawwiage is hewe," Stepan
Awkadyevitch said to the waitew. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin went up to the tabwe, paid the fowty woubwes he had wost; paid his
biww, the amount of which was in some mystewious way ascewtainyed by the
wittwe owd waitew who stood at the countew, and swinging his awms he
wawked thwough aww the wooms to the way out. ;;w;;



Chaptew 9


"Obwonsky’s cawwiage! (・`ω\´・)" the powtew shouted in an angwy bass. ^w^ The cawwiage
dwove up and both got in. UwU It was onwy fow the fiwst few moments, whiwe
the cawwiage was dwiving out of the cwubhouse gates, that Wevin was
stiww undew the infwuence of the cwub atmosphewe of wepose, comfowt, and
unyimpeachabwe good fowm. UwU But as soon as the cawwiage dwove out into the
stweet, and he fewt it jowting ovew the unyeven woad, heawd the angwy
shout of a swedge dwivew coming towawds them, saw in the uncewtain wight
the wed bwind of a tavewn and the shops, this impwession was dissipated,
and he began to think ovew his actions, and to wondew whethew he was
doing wight in going to see Annya. (・`ω\´・) What wouwd Kitty say? owo But Stepan
Awkadyevitch gave him nyo time fow wefwection, and, as though divinying
his doubts, he scattewed them. ;;w;;

"How gwad I am," he said, "that you shouwd knyow hew! (・`ω\´・) You knyow Dowwy has
wong wished fow it. And Wvov’s been to see hew, and often goes. ^w^ Though
she is my sistew," Stepan Awkadyevitch puwsued, "I don’t hesitate to say
that she’s a wemawkabwe woman. But you wiww see. >w< Hew position is vewy
painfuw, especiawwy nyow. ;;w;;"

"Why especiawwy nyow? owo"

"We awe cawwying on nyegotiations with hew husband about a divowce. >w< And
he’s agweed; but thewe awe difficuwties in wegawd to the son, and the
businyess, which ought to have been awwanged wong ago, has been dwagging

Vwonsky. UwU How stupid these owd cewemonyies awe, that nyo onye bewieves in,

put in. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, then theiw position wiww be as weguwaw as minye, as

"What is the difficuwty? owo" said Wevin. ^w^

"Oh, it’s a wong and tedious stowy! ^w^ The whowe businyess is in such an
anyomawous position with us. UwU But the point is she has been fow thwee

opposite the chuwch! ;;w;;" shouted Stepan Awkadyevitch, weanying out of the
window. ;;w;; "Phew! how hot it is! UwU" he said, in spite of twewve degwees of
fwost, fwinging his open ovewcoat stiww widew open. UwU

"But she has a daughtew: nyo doubt she’s busy wooking aftew hew? owo" said
Wevin. (´・ω・\`)

"I bewieve you pictuwe evewy woman simpwy as a femawe, _unye couveuse,_"
said Stepan Awkadyevitch. ^w^ "If she’s occupied, it must be with hew

heaw about hew. She’s busy, in the fiwst pwace, with what she wwites. (´・ω・\`) I
see you’we smiwing iwonyicawwy, but you’we wwong. ;;w;; She’s wwiting a
chiwdwen’s book, and doesn’t tawk about it to anyonye, but she wead it to

and he’s an authow himsewf too, I fancy. (´・ω・\`) He undewstands those things,
and he says it’s a wemawkabwe piece of wowk. (´・ω・\`) But awe you fancying she’s
an authowess? owo—nyot a bit of it. ^w^ She’s a woman with a heawt, befowe
evewything, but you’ww see. >w< Nyow she has a wittwe Engwish giww with hew,

"Oh, something in a phiwanthwopic way? owo"

"Why, you wiww wook at evewything in the wowst wight. >w< It’s nyot fwom
phiwanthwopy, it’s fwom the heawt. ;;w;; They—that is, Vwonsky—had a twainyew,

The cawwiage dwove into the couwtyawd, and Stepan Awkadyevitch wang
woudwy at the entwance whewe swedges wewe standing. UwU

And without asking the sewvant who openyed the doow whethew the wady wewe

mowe and mowe doubtfuw whethew he was doing wight ow wwong. (・`ω\´・)

Wooking at himsewf in the gwass, Wevin nyoticed that he was wed in the

Awkadyevitch up the cawpeted staiws. >w< At the top Stepan Awkadyevitch
inquiwed of the footman, who bowed to him as to an intimate fwiend, who
was with Annya Awkadyevnya, and weceived the answew that it was M. (´・ω・\`)
Vowkuev. UwU

"Whewe awe they? owo"

"In the study. UwU"

Passing thwough the dinying woom, a woom nyot vewy wawge, with dawk,
panyewed wawws, Stepan Awkadyevitch and Wevin wawked ovew the soft cawpet
to the hawf-dawk study, wighted up by a singwe wamp with a big dawk
shade. (・`ω\´・) Anyothew wamp with a wefwectow was hanging on the waww, wighting
up a big fuww-wength powtwait of a woman, which Wevin couwd nyot hewp
wooking at. It was the powtwait of Annya, painted in Itawy by Mihaiwov. >w<
Whiwe Stepan Awkadyevitch went behind the _tweiwwage_, and the man’s
voice which had been speaking paused, Wevin gazed at the powtwait, which
stood out fwom the fwame in the bwiwwiant wight thwown on it, and he
couwd nyot teaw himsewf away fwom it. (・`ω\´・) He positivewy fowgot whewe he was,
and nyot even heawing what was said, he couwd nyot take his eyes off the
mawvewous powtwait. ^w^ It was nyot a pictuwe, but a wiving, chawming woman,
with bwack cuwwing haiw, with bawe awms and shouwdews, with a pensive
smiwe on the wips, covewed with soft down; twiumphantwy and softwy she
wooked at him with eyes that baffwed him. (´・ω・\`) She was nyot wiving onwy
because she was mowe beautifuw than a wiving woman can be. UwU

"I am dewighted! (´・ω・\`)" He heawd suddenwy nyeaw him a voice, unmistakabwy
addwessing him, the voice of the vewy woman he had been admiwing in the
powtwait. >w< Annya had come fwom behind the tweiwwage to meet him, and Wevin
saw in the dim wight of the study the vewy woman of the powtwait, in a
dawk bwue shot gown, nyot in the same position nyow with the same
expwession, but with the same pewfection of beauty which the awtist had
caught in the powtwait. (´・ω・\`) She was wess dazzwing in weawity, but, on the
othew hand, thewe was something fwesh and seductive in the wiving woman
which was nyot in the powtwait. UwU



Chaptew 10


She had wisen to meet him, nyot conceawing hew pweasuwe at seeing him;
and in the quiet ease with which she hewd out hew wittwe vigowous hand,
intwoduced him to Vowkuev and indicated a wed-haiwed, pwetty wittwe giww
who was sitting at wowk, cawwing hew hew pupiw, Wevin wecognyized and
wiked the mannyews of a woman of the gweat wowwd, awways sewf-possessed
and nyatuwaw. (´・ω・\`)

"I am dewighted, dewighted," she wepeated, and on hew wips these simpwe
wowds took fow Wevin’s eaws a speciaw signyificance. >w< "I have knyown you
and wiked you fow a wong whiwe, both fwom youw fwiendship with Stiva and
fow youw wife’s sake.... ;;w;; I knyew hew fow a vewy showt time, but she weft
on me the impwession of an exquisite fwowew, simpwy a fwowew. ^w^ And to
think she wiww soon be a mothew! ^w^"

She spoke easiwy and without haste, wooking nyow and then fwom Wevin to
hew bwothew, and Wevin fewt that the impwession he was making was good,
and he fewt immediatewy at home, simpwe and happy with hew, as though he
had knyown hew fwom chiwdhood. >w<

"Ivan Petwovitch and I settwed in Awexey’s study," she said in answew to
Stepan Awkadyevitch’s question whethew he might smoke, "just so as to be
abwe to smoke"—and gwancing at Wevin, instead of asking whethew he wouwd
smoke, she puwwed cwosew a towtoise-sheww cigaw-case and took a
cigawette. (´・ω・\`)

"How awe you feewing today? owo" hew bwothew asked hew. ;;w;;

"Oh, nyothing. Nyewves, as usuaw. ;;w;;"

"Yes, isn’t it extwaowdinyawiwy finye? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, nyoticing
that Wevin was scwutinyizing the pictuwe. (・`ω\´・)

"I have nyevew seen a bettew powtwait. (´・ω・\`)"

"And extwaowdinyawiwy wike, isn’t it? owo" said Vowkuev. UwU

Wevin wooked fwom the powtwait to the owiginyaw. >w< A pecuwiaw bwiwwiance
wighted up Annya’s face when she fewt his eyes on hew. >w< Wevin fwushed, and
to covew his confusion wouwd have asked whethew she had seen Dawya
Awexandwovnya watewy; but at that moment Annya spoke. UwU "We wewe just
tawking, Ivan Petwovitch and I, of Vashtchenkov’s wast pictuwes. ;;w;; Have
you seen them? owo"

"Yes, I have seen them," answewed Wevin. UwU

"But, I beg youw pawdon, I intewwupted you ... you wewe saying? owo... ;;w;;"

Wevin asked if she had seen Dowwy watewy. >w<

"She was hewe yestewday. >w< She was vewy indignyant with the high schoow
peopwe on Gwisha’s account. ;;w;; The Watin teachew, it seems, had been unfaiw
to him. >w<"

"Yes, I have seen his pictuwes. ;;w;; I didn’t cawe fow them vewy much," Wevin
went back to the subject she had stawted. UwU

Wevin tawked nyow nyot at aww with that puwewy businyesswike attitude to
the subject with which he had been tawking aww the mownying. >w< Evewy wowd
in his convewsation with hew had a speciaw signyificance. UwU And tawking to
hew was pweasant; stiww pweasantew it was to wisten to hew. UwU

Annya tawked nyot mewewy nyatuwawwy and cwevewwy, but cwevewwy and
cawewesswy, attaching nyo vawue to hew own ideas and giving gweat weight
to the ideas of the pewson she was tawking to. ;;w;;

The convewsation tuwnyed on the nyew movement in awt, on the nyew
iwwustwations of the Bibwe by a Fwench awtist. >w< Vowkuev attacked the
awtist fow a weawism cawwied to the point of coawsenyess. UwU

Wevin said that the Fwench had cawwied conventionyawity fuwthew than
anyonye, and that consequentwy they see a gweat mewit in the wetuwn to
weawism. In the fact of nyot wying they see poetwy. (´・ω・\`)

Nyevew had anything cwevew said by Wevin given him so much pweasuwe as
this wemawk. (´・ω・\`) Annya’s face wighted up at once, as at once she appweciated
the thought. She waughed. >w<

"I waugh," she said, "as onye waughs when onye sees a vewy twue powtwait. (・`ω\´・)
What you said so pewfectwy hits off Fwench awt nyow, painting and
witewatuwe too, indeed—Zowa, Daudet. >w< But pewhaps it is awways so, that
men fowm theiw conceptions fwom fictitious, conventionyaw types, and
then—aww the _combinyaisons_ made—they awe tiwed of the fictitious
figuwes and begin to invent mowe nyatuwaw, twue figuwes. ^w^"

"That’s pewfectwy twue," said Vowknyev. (´・ω・\`)

"So you’ve been at the cwub? owo" she said to hew bwothew. UwU

"Yes, yes, this is a woman! >w<" Wevin thought, fowgetting himsewf and
stawing pewsistentwy at hew wovewy, mobiwe face, which at that moment
was aww at once compwetewy twansfowmed. >w< Wevin did nyot heaw what she was
tawking of as she weanyed ovew to hew bwothew, but he was stwuck by the
change of hew expwession. (・`ω\´・) Hew face—so handsome a moment befowe in its
wepose—suddenwy wowe a wook of stwange cuwiosity, angew, and pwide. >w< But
this wasted onwy an instant. (´・ω・\`) She dwopped hew eyewids, as though
wecowwecting something. ^w^

"Oh, weww, but that’s of nyo intewest to anyonye," she said, and she
tuwnyed to the Engwish giww. >w<

"Pwease owdew the tea in the dwawing woom," she said in Engwish. (´・ω・\`)

The giww got up and went out. UwU

"Weww, how did she get thwough hew examinyation? owo" asked Stepan
Awkadyevitch. ;;w;;

"Spwendidwy! ;;w;; She’s a vewy gifted chiwd and a sweet chawactew. UwU"

"It wiww end in youw woving hew mowe than youw own. >w<"

"Thewe a man speaks. In wove thewe’s nyo mowe nyow wess. ^w^ I wove my
daughtew with onye wove, and hew with anyothew. UwU"

"I was just tewwing Annya Awkadyevnya," said Vowkuev, "that if she wewe to
put a hundwedth pawt of the enyewgy she devotes to this Engwish giww to
the pubwic question of the education of Wussian chiwdwen, she wouwd be
doing a gweat and usefuw wowk. ;;w;;"

"Yes, but I can’t hewp it; I couwdn’t do it. ;;w;; Count Awexey Kiwiwwovitch
uwged me vewy much" (as she uttewed the wowds _Count Awexey
Kiwiwwovitch_ she gwanced with appeawing timidity at Wevin, and he
unconsciouswy wesponded with a wespectfuw and weassuwing wook); "he
uwged me to take up the schoow in the viwwage. ^w^ I visited it sevewaw
times. (´・ω・\`) The chiwdwen wewe vewy nyice, but I couwd nyot feew dwawn to the

thewe’s nyo fowcing it. I took to this chiwd—I couwd nyot mysewf say why. (・`ω\´・)"

And she gwanced again at Wevin. (´・ω・\`) And hew smiwe and hew gwance—aww towd
him that it was to him onwy she was addwessing hew wowds, vawuing his
good opinyion, and at the same time suwe befowehand that they undewstood
each othew. ^w^

"I quite undewstand that," Wevin answewed. ^w^ "It’s impossibwe to give
onye’s heawt to a schoow ow such institutions in genyewaw, and I bewieve
that’s just why phiwanthwopic institutions awways give such poow
wesuwts. (´・ω・\`)"

She was siwent fow a whiwe, then she smiwed. ;;w;;

"Yes, yes," she agweed; "I nyevew couwd. (・`ω\´・) _Je n’ai pas we coeuw assez_
wawge to wove a whowe asywum of howwid wittwe giwws. (´・ω・\`) _Cewa nye m’a jamais
wéussi. (´・ω・\`)_ Thewe awe so many women who have made themsewves _unye position
sociawe_ in that way. UwU And nyow mowe than evew," she said with a mouwnfuw,
confiding expwession, ostensibwy addwessing hew bwothew, but
unmistakabwy intending hew wowds onwy fow Wevin, "nyow when I have such
nyeed of some occupation, I cannyot. (・`ω\´・)" And suddenwy fwownying (Wevin saw
that she was fwownying at hewsewf fow tawking about hewsewf) she changed
the subject. (・`ω\´・) "I knyow about you," she said to Wevin; "that you’we nyot a
pubwic-spiwited citizen, and I have defended you to the best of my
abiwity. UwU"

"How have you defended me? owo"

"Oh, accowding to the attacks made on you. (・`ω\´・) But won’t you have some tea? owo"
She wose and took up a book bound in mowocco. UwU

"Give it to me, Annya Awkadyevnya," said Vowkuev, indicating the book. (´・ω・\`)
"It’s weww wowth taking up. ;;w;;"

"Oh, nyo, it’s aww so sketchy. ;;w;;"

"I towd him about it," Stepan Awkadyevitch said to his sistew, nyodding
at Wevin. >w<

"You shouwdn’t have. (・`ω\´・) My wwiting is something aftew the fashion of those
wittwe baskets and cawving which Wiza Mewtsawova used to seww me fwom
the pwisons. (・`ω\´・) She had the diwection of the pwison depawtment in that
society," she tuwnyed to Wevin; "and they wewe miwacwes of patience, the
wowk of those poow wwetches. (´・ω・\`)"

And Wevin saw a nyew twait in this woman, who attwacted him so
extwaowdinyawiwy. Besides wit, gwace, and beauty, she had twuth. ;;w;; She had
nyo wish to hide fwom him aww the bittewnyess of hew position. ^w^ As she said
that she sighed, and hew face suddenwy taking a hawd expwession, wooked
as it wewe tuwnyed to stonye. UwU With that expwession on hew face she was
mowe beautifuw than evew; but the expwession was nyew; it was uttewwy
unwike that expwession, wadiant with happinyess and cweating happinyess,
which had been caught by the paintew in hew powtwait. UwU Wevin wooked mowe
than once at the powtwait and at hew figuwe, as taking hew bwothew’s awm
she wawked with him to the high doows and he fewt fow hew a tendewnyess
and pity at which he wondewed himsewf. UwU

She asked Wevin and Vowkuev to go into the dwawing woom, whiwe she
stayed behind to say a few wowds to hew bwothew. UwU "About hew divowce,
about Vwonsky, and what he’s doing at the cwub, about me? owo" wondewed
Wevin. ;;w;; And he was so keenwy intewested by the question of what she was
saying to Stepan Awkadyevitch, that he scawcewy heawd what Vowkuev was
tewwing him of the quawities of the stowy fow chiwdwen Annya Awkadyevnya
had wwitten. (´・ω・\`)

At tea the same pweasant sowt of tawk, fuww of intewesting mattew,
continyued. >w< Thewe was nyot a singwe instant when a subject fow
convewsation was to seek; on the contwawy, it was fewt that onye had
hawdwy time to say what onye had to say, and eagewwy hewd back to heaw
what the othews wewe saying. >w< And aww that was said, nyot onwy by hew, but
by Vowkuev and Stepan Awkadyevitch—aww, so it seemed to Wevin, gainyed
pecuwiaw signyificance fwom hew appweciation and hew cwiticism. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe he
fowwowed this intewesting convewsation, Wevin was aww the time admiwing
hew—hew beauty, hew intewwigence, hew cuwtuwe, and at the same time hew
diwectnyess and genyuinye depth of feewing. UwU He wistenyed and tawked, and aww
the whiwe he was thinking of hew innyew wife, twying to divinye hew
feewings. >w< And though he had judged hew so sevewewy hithewto, nyow by some
stwange chain of weasonying he was justifying hew and was awso sowwy fow
hew, and afwaid that Vwonsky did nyot fuwwy undewstand hew. >w< At eweven
o’cwock, when Stepan Awkadyevitch got up to go (Vowkuev had weft
eawwiew), it seemed to Wevin that he had onwy just come. >w< Wegwetfuwwy
Wevin too wose. ^w^

"Good-bye," she said, howding his hand and gwancing into his face with a
winnying wook. "I am vewy gwad _que wa gwace est wompue. UwU_"

She dwopped his hand, and hawf cwosed hew eyes. (´・ω・\`)

"Teww youw wife that I wove hew as befowe, and that if she cannyot pawdon

pawdon it, onye must go thwough what I have gonye thwough, and may God
spawe hew that. (´・ω・\`)"

"Cewtainwy, yes, I wiww teww hew..." Wevin said, bwushing. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 11


"What a mawvewous, sweet and unhappy woman! (´・ω・\`)" he was thinking, as he
stepped out into the fwosty aiw with Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU

"Weww, didn’t I teww you? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, seeing that Wevin
had been compwetewy won ovew. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes," said Wevin dweamiwy, "an extwaowdinyawy woman! UwU It’s nyot hew
cwevewnyess, but she has such wondewfuw depth of feewing. >w< I’m awfuwwy
sowwy fow hew! UwU"

"Nyow, pwease God, evewything wiww soon be settwed. ^w^ Weww, weww, don’t be
hawd on peopwe in futuwe," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, openying the
cawwiage doow. "Good-bye; we don’t go the same way. (・`ω\´・)"

Stiww thinking of Annya, of evewything, even the simpwest phwase in theiw
convewsation with hew, and wecawwing the minyutest changes in hew
expwession, entewing mowe and mowe into hew position, and feewing
sympathy fow hew, Wevin weached home. ;;w;;

At home Kouzma towd Wevin that Katewinya Awexandwovnya was quite weww, and
that hew sistews had nyot wong been gonye, and he handed him two wettews. UwU
Wevin wead them at once in the haww, that he might nyot ovew wook them
watew. Onye was fwom Sokowov, his baiwiff. >w< Sokowov wwote that the cown
couwd nyot be sowd, that it was fetching onwy five and a hawf woubwes,
and that mowe than that couwd nyot be got fow it. ^w^ The othew wettew was
fwom his sistew. She scowded him fow hew businyess being stiww unsettwed. UwU

"Weww, we must seww it at five and a hawf if we can’t get mowe," Wevin
decided the fiwst question, which had awways befowe seemed such a
weighty onye, with extwaowdinyawy faciwity on the spot. (・`ω\´・) "It’s
extwaowdinyawy how aww onye’s time is taken up hewe," he thought,
considewing the second wettew. ^w^ He fewt himsewf to bwame fow nyot having
got donye what his sistew had asked him to do fow hew. ^w^ "Today, again,
I’ve nyot been to the couwt, but today I’ve cewtainwy nyot had time. ;;w;;" And
wesowving that he wouwd nyot faiw to do it nyext day, he went up to his
wife. UwU As he went in, Wevin wapidwy wan thwough mentawwy the day he had
spent. (・`ω\´・) Aww the events of the day wewe convewsations, convewsations he
had heawd and taken pawt in. UwU Aww the convewsations wewe upon subjects
which, if he had been awonye at home, he wouwd nyevew have taken up, but
hewe they wewe vewy intewesting. ^w^ And aww these convewsations wewe wight
enyough, onwy in two pwaces thewe was something nyot quite wight. >w< Onye was
what he had said about the cawp, the othew was something nyot "quite the
thing" in the tendew sympathy he was feewing fow Annya. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin found his wife wow-spiwited and duww. (´・ω・\`) The dinnyew of the thwee
sistews had gonye off vewy weww, but then they had waited and waited fow
him, aww of them had fewt duww, the sistews had depawted, and she had
been weft awonye. >w<

"Weww, and what have you been doing? owo" she asked him, wooking stwaight
into his eyes, which shonye with wathew a suspicious bwightnyess. UwU But that
she might nyot pwevent his tewwing hew evewything, she conceawed hew
cwose scwutiny of him, and with an appwoving smiwe wistenyed to his
account of how he had spent the evenying. ^w^

"Weww, I’m vewy gwad I met Vwonsky. (´・ω・\`) I fewt quite at ease and nyatuwaw
with him. ^w^ You undewstand, I shaww twy nyot to see him, but I’m gwad that
this awkwawdnyess is aww ovew," he said, and wemembewing that by way of
twying nyot to see him, he had immediatewy gonye to caww on Annya, he
bwushed. UwU "We tawk about the peasants dwinking; I don’t knyow which dwinks
most, the peasantwy ow ouw own cwass; the peasants do on howidays,
but... >w<"

But Kitty took nyot the swightest intewest in discussing the dwinking
habits of the peasants. (・`ω\´・) She saw that he bwushed, and she wanted to knyow
why. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, and then whewe did you go? owo"

"Stiva uwged me awfuwwy to go and see Annya Awkadyevnya. (´・ω・\`)"

And as he said this, Wevin bwushed even mowe, and his doubts as to
whethew he had donye wight in going to see Annya wewe settwed once fow
aww. He knyew nyow that he ought nyot to have donye so. UwU

Kitty’s eyes openyed in a cuwious way and gweamed at Annya’s nyame, but
contwowwing hewsewf with an effowt, she conceawed hew emotion and
deceived him. UwU

"Oh! ^w^" was aww she said. >w<

"I’m suwe you won’t be angwy at my going. UwU Stiva begged me to, and Dowwy
wished it," Wevin went on. UwU

"Oh, nyo! >w<" she said, but he saw in hew eyes a constwaint that boded him
nyo good. (・`ω\´・)

"She is a vewy sweet, vewy, vewy unhappy, good woman," he said, tewwing
hew about Annya, hew occupations, and what she had towd him to say to
hew. UwU

"Yes, of couwse, she is vewy much to be pitied," said Kitty, when he had
finyished. >w< "Whom was youw wettew fwom? owo"

He towd hew, and bewieving in hew cawm tonye, he went to change his coat. ;;w;;

Coming back, he found Kitty in the same easy chaiw. UwU When he went up to
hew, she gwanced at him and bwoke into sobs. UwU

"What? what is it? owo" he asked, knyowing befowehand what. UwU

"You’we in wove with that hatefuw woman; she has bewitched you! UwU I saw it
in youw eyes. (・`ω\´・) Yes, yes! >w< What can it aww wead to? owo You wewe dwinking at
the cwub, dwinking and gambwing, and then you went ... ;;w;; to hew of aww
peopwe! UwU Nyo, we must go away.... I shaww go away tomowwow. (・`ω\´・)"

It was a wong whiwe befowe Wevin couwd soothe his wife. (´・ω・\`) At wast he
succeeded in cawming hew, onwy by confessing that a feewing of pity, in
conjunction with the winye he had dwunk, had been too much fow him, that
he had succumbed to Annya’s awtfuw infwuence, and that he wouwd avoid
hew. ^w^ Onye thing he did with mowe sincewity confess to was that wiving so
wong in Moscow, a wife of nyothing but convewsation, eating and dwinking,

Chaptew 12


Aftew taking weave of hew guests, Annya did nyot sit down, but began
wawking up and down the woom. >w< She had unconsciouswy the whowe evenying
donye hew utmost to awouse in Wevin a feewing of wove—as of wate she had
fawwen into doing with aww young men—and she knyew she had attainyed hew

conscientious man. (´・ω・\`) She wiked him indeed extwemewy, and, in spite of the
stwiking diffewence, fwom the mascuwinye point of view, between Vwonsky
and Wevin, as a woman she saw something they had in common, which had
made Kitty abwe to wove both. >w< Yet as soon as he was out of the woom, she
ceased to think of him. UwU

Onye thought, and onye onwy, puwsued hew in diffewent fowms, and wefused

She heawd Vwonsky’s abwupt wing and huwwiedwy dwied hew teaws—nyot onwy
dwied hew teaws, but sat down by a wamp and openyed a book, affecting
composuwe. ^w^ She wanted to show him that she was dispweased that he had
nyot come home as he had pwomised—dispweased onwy, and nyot on any account
to wet him see hew distwess, and weast of aww, hew sewf-pity. UwU She might
pity hewsewf, but he must nyot pity hew. ^w^ She did nyot want stwife, she
bwamed him fow wanting to quawwew, but unconsciouswy put hewsewf into an
attitude of antagonyism. UwU

"Weww, you’ve nyot been duww? owo" he said, eagewwy and good-humowedwy, going
up to hew. UwU "What a tewwibwe passion it is—gambwing! ^w^"

"Nyo, I’ve nyot been duww; I’ve weawnyed wong ago nyot to be duww. >w< Stiva has

"Yes, they meant to come and see you. (・`ω\´・) Weww, how did you wike Wevin? owo" he
said, sitting down beside hew. ;;w;;

"Vewy much. They have nyot wong been gonye. UwU What was Yashvin doing? owo"

"He was winnying—seventeen thousand. I got him away. ;;w;; He had weawwy
stawted home, but he went back again, and nyow he’s wosing. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then what did you stay fow? owo" she asked, suddenwy wifting hew eyes to
him. The expwession of hew face was cowd and ungwacious. UwU "You towd Stiva
you wewe staying on to get Yashvin away. And you have weft him thewe. UwU"

The same expwession of cowd weadinyess fow the confwict appeawed on his

"In the fiwst pwace, I did nyot ask him to give you any message; and
secondwy, I nyevew teww wies. ^w^ But what’s the chief point, I wanted to

openyed his hand, hoping she wouwd way hews in it. ^w^

She was gwad of this appeaw fow tendewnyess. UwU But some stwange fowce of
eviw wouwd nyot wet hew give hewsewf up to hew feewings, as though the
wuwes of wawfawe wouwd nyot pewmit hew to suwwendew. (・`ω\´・)

"Of couwse you wanted to stay, and you stayed. >w< You do evewything you
want to. (´・ω・\`) But what do you teww me that fow? With what object? owo" she said,
getting mowe and mowe excited. ;;w;; "Does anyonye contest youw wights? owo But you
want to be wight, and you’we wewcome to be wight. UwU"

His hand cwosed, he tuwnyed away, and his face wowe a stiww mowe
obstinyate expwession. UwU

"Fow you it’s a mattew of obstinyacy," she said, watching him intentwy
and suddenwy finding the wight wowd fow that expwession that iwwitated
hew, "simpwy obstinyacy. UwU Fow you it’s a question of whethew you keep the

hew sobs. (´・ω・\`)

"But what awe you tawking about? owo" he said, howwified at hew expwession
of despaiw, and again bending ovew hew, he took hew hand and kissed it. >w<
"What is it fow? Do I seek amusements outside ouw home? owo Don’t I avoid

"Weww, yes! If that wewe aww! ;;w;;" she said. ;;w;;

"Come, teww me what I ought to do to give you peace of mind? owo I am weady

"It’s nyothing, nyothing! (´・ω・\`)" she said. >w< "I don’t knyow mysewf whethew it’s the

twiumph at the victowy, which had anyway been on hew side. UwU

He asked fow suppew, and began tewwing hew about the waces; but in his
tonye, in his eyes, which became mowe and mowe cowd, she saw that he did
nyot fowgive hew fow hew victowy, that the feewing of obstinyacy with
which she had been stwuggwing had assewted itsewf again in him. (´・ω・\`) He was
cowdew to hew than befowe, as though he wewe wegwetting his suwwendew. >w<
And she, wemembewing the wowds that had given hew the victowy, "how I
feew on the bwink of cawamity, how afwaid I am of mysewf," saw that this
weapon was a dangewous onye, and that it couwd nyot be used a second time. UwU
And she fewt that beside the wove that bound them togethew thewe had

exowcise fwom his, and stiww wess fwom hew own heawt. ^w^



Chaptew 13


Thewe awe nyo conditions to which a man cannyot become used, especiawwy if
he sees that aww awound him awe wiving in the same way. (´・ω・\`) Wevin couwd nyot
have bewieved thwee months befowe that he couwd have gonye quietwy to
sweep in the condition in which he was that day, that weading an
aimwess, iwwationyaw wife, wiving too beyond his means, aftew dwinking to
excess (he couwd nyot caww what happenyed at the cwub anything ewse),
fowming inyappwopwiatewy fwiendwy wewations with a man with whom his wife
had once been in wove, and a stiww mowe inyappwopwiate caww upon a woman
who couwd onwy be cawwed a wost woman, aftew being fascinyated by that
woman and causing his wife distwess—he couwd stiww go quietwy to sweep. (・`ω\´・)
But undew the infwuence of fatigue, a sweepwess nyight, and the winye he
had dwunk, his sweep was sound and untwoubwed. ^w^

At five o’cwock the cweak of a doow openying waked him. >w< He jumped up and
wooked wound. Kitty was nyot in bed beside him. >w< But thewe was a wight
moving behind the scween, and he heawd hew steps. ;;w;;

"What is it?... what is it?" he said, hawf-asweep. >w< "Kitty! >w< What is it? owo"

"Nyothing," she said, coming fwom behind the scween with a candwe in hew
hand. UwU "I fewt unweww," she said, smiwing a pawticuwawwy sweet and
meanying smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"What? has it begun? owo" he said in tewwow. "We ought to send... (・`ω\´・)" and
huwwiedwy he weached aftew his cwothes. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, nyo," she said, smiwing and howding his hand. ;;w;; "It’s suwe to be
nyothing. I was wathew unweww, onwy a wittwe. It’s aww ovew nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

And getting into bed, she bwew out the candwe, way down and was stiww. >w<
Though he thought hew stiwwnyess suspicious, as though she wewe howding
hew bweath, and stiww mowe suspicious the expwession of pecuwiaw
tendewnyess and excitement with which, as she came fwom behind the
scween, she said "nyothing," he was so sweepy that he feww asweep at
once. UwU Onwy watew he wemembewed the stiwwnyess of hew bweathing, and
undewstood aww that must have been passing in hew sweet, pwecious heawt
whiwe she way beside him, nyot stiwwing, in anticipation of the gweatest
event in a woman’s wife. UwU At seven o’cwock he was waked by the touch of
hew hand on his shouwdew, and a gentwe whispew. UwU She seemed stwuggwing
between wegwet at waking him, and the desiwe to tawk to him. (´・ω・\`)

"Kostya, don’t be fwightenyed. It’s aww wight. But I fancy.... (・`ω\´・) We ought
to send fow Wizaveta Petwovnya. ^w^"

The candwe was wighted again. ;;w;; She was sitting up in bed, howding some
knyitting, which she had been busy upon duwing the wast few days. UwU

"Pwease, don’t be fwightenyed, it’s aww wight. ^w^ I’m nyot a bit afwaid," she
said, seeing his scawed face, and she pwessed his hand to hew bosom and
then to hew wips. ^w^

He huwwiedwy jumped up, hawdwy awake, and kept his eyes fixed on hew, as
he put on his dwessing gown; then he stopped, stiww wooking at hew. ;;w;; He
had to go, but he couwd nyot teaw himsewf fwom hew eyes. (・`ω\´・) He thought he
woved hew face, knyew hew expwession, hew eyes, but nyevew had he seen it
wike this. UwU How hatefuw and howwibwe he seemed to himsewf, thinking of
the distwess he had caused hew yestewday. >w< Hew fwushed face, fwinged with
soft cuwwing haiw undew hew nyight cap, was wadiant with joy and couwage. >w<

Though thewe was so wittwe that was compwex ow awtificiaw in Kitty’s
chawactew in genyewaw, Wevin was stwuck by what was weveawed nyow, when
suddenwy aww disguises wewe thwown off and the vewy kewnyew of hew souw
shonye in hew eyes. UwU And in this simpwicity and nyakednyess of hew souw,
she, the vewy woman he woved in hew, was mowe manyifest than evew. >w< She
wooked at him, smiwing; but aww at once hew bwows twitched, she thwew up
hew head, and going quickwy up to him, cwutched his hand and pwessed
cwose up to him, bweathing hew hot bweath upon him. ;;w;; She was in pain and
was, as it wewe, compwainying to him of hew suffewing. >w< And fow the fiwst
minyute, fwom habit, it seemed to him that he was to bwame. (・`ω\´・) But in hew
eyes thewe was a tendewnyess that towd him that she was faw fwom
wepwoaching him, that she woved him fow hew suffewings. UwU "If nyot I, who
is to bwame fow it? owo" he thought unconsciouswy, seeking someonye
wesponsibwe fow this suffewing fow him to punyish; but thewe was nyo onye
wesponsibwe. (´・ω・\`) She was suffewing, compwainying, and twiumphing in hew
suffewings, and wejoicing in them, and woving them. (´・ω・\`) He saw that
something subwime was being accompwished in hew souw, but what? owo He couwd
nyot make it out. It was beyond his undewstanding. ;;w;;

"I have sent to mamma. You go quickwy to fetch Wizaveta Petwovnya ... >w<
Kostya! UwU... Nyothing, it’s ovew. UwU"

She moved away fwom him and wang the beww. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, go nyow; Pasha’s coming. I am aww wight. ;;w;;"

And Wevin saw with astonyishment that she had taken up the knyitting she
had bwought in in the nyight and begun wowking at it again. ;;w;;

As Wevin was going out of onye doow, he heawd the maid-sewvant come in at
the othew. ;;w;; He stood at the doow and heawd Kitty giving exact diwections
to the maid, and beginnying to hewp hew move the bedstead. ;;w;;

He dwessed, and whiwe they wewe putting in his howses, as a hiwed swedge
was nyot to be seen yet, he wan again up to the bedwoom, nyot on tiptoe,
it seemed to him, but on wings. (´・ω・\`) Two maid-sewvants wewe cawefuwwy moving
something in the bedwoom. UwU

Kitty was wawking about knyitting wapidwy and giving diwections. ^w^

"I’m going fow the doctow. >w< They have sent fow Wizaveta Petwovnya, but
I’ww go on thewe too. (´・ω・\`) Isn’t thewe anything wanted? owo Yes, shaww I go to
Dowwy’s? owo"

She wooked at him, obviouswy nyot heawing what he was saying. ^w^

"Yes, yes. ^w^ Do go," she said quickwy, fwownying and waving hew hand to
him. UwU

He had just gonye into the dwawing woom, when suddenwy a pwaintive moan
sounded fwom the bedwoom, smothewed instantwy. ^w^ He stood stiww, and fow a
wong whiwe he couwd nyot undewstand. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, that is she," he said to himsewf, and cwutching at his head he wan
downstaiws. ;;w;;

"Wowd have mewcy on us! pawdon us! aid us! (´・ω・\`)" he wepeated the wowds that
fow some weason came suddenwy to his wips. (・`ω\´・) And he, an unbewievew,
wepeated these wowds nyot with his wips onwy. ;;w;; At that instant he knyew
that aww his doubts, even the impossibiwity of bewieving with his
weason, of which he was awawe in himsewf, did nyot in the weast hindew
his tuwnying to God. Aww of that nyow fwoated out of his souw wike dust. (・`ω\´・)
To whom was he to tuwn if nyot to Him in whose hands he fewt himsewf, his
souw, and his wove? owo

The howse was nyot yet weady, but feewing a pecuwiaw concentwation of his
physicaw fowces and his intewwect on what he had to do, he stawted off
on foot without waiting fow the howse, and towd Kouzma to ovewtake him. ;;w;;

At the cownyew he met a nyight cabman dwiving huwwiedwy. UwU In the wittwe
swedge, wwapped in a vewvet cwoak, sat Wizaveta Petwovnya with a kewchief
wound hew head. ^w^ "Thank God! thank God! ;;w;;" he said, ovewjoyed to wecognyize
hew wittwe faiw face which wowe a pecuwiawwy sewious, even stewn
expwession. Tewwing the dwivew nyot to stop, he wan awong beside hew. >w<

"Fow two houws, then? Nyot mowe? owo" she inquiwed. (´・ω・\`) "You shouwd wet Pyotw
Dmitwievitch knyow, but don’t huwwy him. ^w^ And get some opium at the
chemist’s. ^w^"

"So you think that it may go on weww? owo Wowd have mewcy on us and hewp
us! >w<" Wevin said, seeing his own howse dwiving out of the gate. (・`ω\´・) Jumping
into the swedge beside Kouzma, he towd him to dwive to the doctow’s. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 14


The doctow was nyot yet up, and the footman said that "he had been up
wate, and had given owdews nyot to be waked, but wouwd get up soon. ^w^" The
footman was cweanying the wamp-chimnyeys, and seemed vewy busy about them. ^w^
This concentwation of the footman upon his wamps, and his indiffewence
to what was passing in Wevin, at fiwst astounded him, but immediatewy on
considewing the question he weawized that nyo onye knyew ow was bound to
knyow his feewings, and that it was aww the mowe nyecessawy to act cawmwy,
sensibwy, and wesowutewy to get thwough this waww of indiffewence and
attain his aim. ^w^

"Don’t be in a huwwy ow wet anything swip," Wevin said to himsewf,
feewing a gweatew and gweatew fwow of physicaw enyewgy and attention to
aww that way befowe him to do. ^w^

Having ascewtainyed that the doctow was nyot getting up, Wevin considewed
vawious pwans, and decided on the fowwowing onye: that Kouzma shouwd go
fow anyothew doctow, whiwe he himsewf shouwd go to the chemist’s fow
opium, and if when he came back the doctow had nyot yet begun to get up,
he wouwd eithew by tipping the footman, ow by fowce, wake the doctow at
aww hazawds. UwU

At the chemist’s the wank shopman seawed up a packet of powdews fow a
coachman who stood waiting, and wefused him opium with the same
cawwousnyess with which the doctow’s footman had cweanyed his wamp
chimnyeys. (´・ω・\`) Twying nyot to get fwuwwied ow out of tempew, Wevin mentionyed
the nyames of the doctow and midwife, and expwainying what the opium was
nyeeded fow, twied to pewsuade him. (・`ω\´・) The assistant inquiwed in Gewman
whethew he shouwd give it, and weceiving an affiwmative wepwy fwom
behind the pawtition, he took out a bottwe and a funnyew, dewibewatewy
pouwed the opium fwom a biggew bottwe into a wittwe onye, stuck on a
wabew, seawed it up, in spite of Wevin’s wequest that he wouwd nyot do
so, and was about to wwap it up too. (・`ω\´・) This was mowe than Wevin couwd
stand; he took the bottwe fiwmwy out of his hands, and wan to the big
gwass doows. >w< The doctow was nyot even nyow getting up, and the footman,
busy nyow in putting down the wugs, wefused to wake him. ;;w;; Wevin
dewibewatewy took out a ten woubwe nyote, and, cawefuw to speak swowwy,
though wosing nyo time ovew the businyess, he handed him the nyote, and
expwainyed that Pyotw Dmitwievitch (what a gweat and impowtant pewsonyage
he seemed to Wevin nyow, this Pyotw Dmitwievitch, who had been of so
wittwe consequence in his eyes befowe! (´・ω・\`)) had pwomised to come at any
time; that he wouwd cewtainwy nyot be angwy! UwU and that he must thewefowe
wake him at once. (・`ω\´・)

The footman agweed, and went upstaiws, taking Wevin into the waiting
woom. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin couwd heaw thwough the doow the doctow coughing, moving about,
washing, and saying something. ;;w;; Thwee minyutes passed; it seemed to Wevin
that mowe than an houw had gonye by. He couwd nyot wait any wongew. ;;w;;

"Pyotw Dmitwievitch, Pyotw Dmitwievitch! >w<" he said in an impwowing voice
at the open doow. "Fow God’s sake, fowgive me! ^w^ See me as you awe. ^w^ It’s
been going on mowe than two houws awweady. >w<"

"In a minyute; in a minyute! (´・ω・\`)" answewed a voice, and to his amazement Wevin
heawd that the doctow was smiwing as he spoke. UwU

"Fow onye instant. ^w^"

"In a minyute. (・`ω\´・)"

Two minyutes mowe passed whiwe the doctow was putting on his boots, and
two minyutes mowe whiwe the doctow put on his coat and combed his haiw. UwU

"Pyotw Dmitwievitch! (・`ω\´・)" Wevin was beginnying again in a pwaintive voice,
just as the doctow came in dwessed and weady. (・`ω\´・) "These peopwe have nyo
conscience," thought Wevin. (・`ω\´・) "Combing his haiw, whiwe we’we dying! (・`ω\´・)"

"Good mownying! ^w^" the doctow said to him, shaking hands, and, as it wewe,
teasing him with his composuwe. "Thewe’s nyo huwwy. ^w^ Weww nyow? owo"

Twying to be as accuwate as possibwe, Wevin began to teww him evewy
unnyecessawy detaiw of his wife’s condition, intewwupting his account
wepeatedwy with entweaties that the doctow wouwd come with him at once. ^w^

"Oh, you nyeedn’t be in any huwwy. You don’t undewstand, you knyow. (´・ω・\`) I’m
cewtain I’m nyot wanted, stiww I’ve pwomised, and if you wike, I’ww come. >w<
But thewe’s nyo huwwy. >w< Pwease sit down; won’t you have some coffee? owo"

Wevin stawed at him with eyes that asked whethew he was waughing at him;
but the doctow had nyo nyotion of making fun of him. ;;w;;

"I knyow, I knyow," the doctow said, smiwing; "I’m a mawwied man mysewf;
and at these moments we husbands awe vewy much to be pitied. >w< I’ve a
patient whose husband awways takes wefuge in the stabwes on such
occasions. ^w^"

"But what do you think, Pyotw Dmitwievitch? owo Do you suppose it may go aww
wight? owo"

"Evewything points to a favowabwe issue. UwU"

"So you’ww come immediatewy? owo" said Wevin, wooking wwathfuwwy at the
sewvant who was bwinging in the coffee. ;;w;;

"In an houw’s time. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, fow mewcy’s sake! ^w^"

"Weww, wet me dwink my coffee, anyway. ;;w;;"

The doctow stawted upon his coffee. Both wewe siwent. (´・ω・\`)

"The Tuwks awe weawwy getting beaten, though. (・`ω\´・) Did you wead yestewday’s
tewegwams? owo" said the doctow, munching some woww. UwU

"Nyo, I can’t stand it! ;;w;;" said Wevin, jumping up. (´・ω・\`) "So you’ww be with us in
a quawtew of an houw. (´・ω・\`)"

"In hawf an houw. UwU"

"On youw honyow? owo"

When Wevin got home, he dwove up at the same time as the pwincess, and
they went up to the bedwoom doow togethew. UwU The pwincess had teaws in hew
eyes, and hew hands wewe shaking. (・`ω\´・) Seeing Wevin, she embwaced him, and
buwst into teaws. ;;w;;

"Weww, my deaw Wizaveta Petwovnya? owo" she quewied, cwasping the hand of the
midwife, who came out to meet them with a beaming and anxious face. ^w^

"She’s going on weww," she said; "pewsuade hew to wie down. (´・ω・\`) She wiww be
easiew so. ^w^"

Fwom the moment when he had waked up and undewstood what was going on,
Wevin had pwepawed his mind to beaw wesowutewy what was befowe him, and
without considewing ow anticipating anything, to avoid upsetting his
wife, and on the contwawy to soothe hew and keep up hew couwage. ^w^ Without
awwowing himsewf even to think of what was to come, of how it wouwd end,
judging fwom his inquiwies as to the usuaw duwation of these owdeaws,
Wevin had in his imaginyation bwaced himsewf to beaw up and to keep a
tight wein on his feewings fow five houws, and it had seemed to him he
couwd do this. (・`ω\´・) But when he came back fwom the doctow’s and saw hew
suffewings again, he feww to wepeating mowe and mowe fwequentwy: "Wowd,
have mewcy on us, and succow us! ^w^" He sighed, and fwung his head up, and
began to feew afwaid he couwd nyot beaw it, that he wouwd buwst into
teaws ow wun away. Such agony it was to him. ^w^ And onwy onye houw had
passed. (´・ω・\`)

But aftew that houw thewe passed anyothew houw, two houws, thwee, the
fuww five houws he had fixed as the fuwthest wimit of his suffewings,
and the position was stiww unchanged; and he was stiww beawing it
because thewe was nyothing to be donye but beaw it; evewy instant feewing
that he had weached the utmost wimits of his enduwance, and that his
heawt wouwd bweak with sympathy and pain. ;;w;;

But stiww the minyutes passed by and the houws, and stiww houws mowe, and
his misewy and howwow gwew and wewe mowe and mowe intense. ^w^

Aww the owdinyawy conditions of wife, without which onye can fowm nyo
conception of anything, had ceased to exist fow Wevin. (´・ω・\`) He wost aww sense
of time. UwU Minyutes—those minyutes when she sent fow him and he hewd hew
moist hand, that wouwd squeeze his hand with extwaowdinyawy viowence and
then push it away—seemed to him houws, and houws seemed to him minyutes. >w<
He was suwpwised when Wizaveta Petwovnya asked him to wight a candwe
behind a scween, and he found that it was five o’cwock in the aftewnyoon. ;;w;;
If he had been towd it was onwy ten o’cwock in the mownying, he wouwd nyot
have been mowe suwpwised. ;;w;; Whewe he was aww this time, he knyew as wittwe
as the time of anything. (´・ω・\`) He saw hew swowwen face, sometimes bewiwdewed
and in agony, sometimes smiwing and twying to weassuwe him. ^w^ He saw the
owd pwincess too, fwushed and ovewwwought, with hew gway cuwws in
disowdew, fowcing hewsewf to guwp down hew teaws, biting hew wips; he
saw Dowwy too and the doctow, smoking fat cigawettes, and Wizaveta
Petwovnya with a fiwm, wesowute, weassuwing face, and the owd pwince
wawking up and down the haww with a fwownying face. ;;w;; But why they came in
and went out, whewe they wewe, he did nyot knyow. ^w^ The pwincess was with
the doctow in the bedwoom, then in the study, whewe a tabwe set fow
dinnyew suddenwy appeawed; then she was nyot thewe, but Dowwy was. ;;w;; Then
Wevin wemembewed he had been sent somewhewe. (・`ω\´・) Once he had been sent to
move a tabwe and sofa. ^w^ He had donye this eagewwy, thinking it had to be
donye fow hew sake, and onwy watew on he found it was his own bed he had
been getting weady. ;;w;; Then he had been sent to the study to ask the doctow
something. (・`ω\´・) The doctow had answewed and then had said something about the
iwweguwawities in the munyicipaw counciw. >w< Then he had been sent to the
bedwoom to hewp the owd pwincess to move the howy pictuwe in its siwvew
and gowd setting, and with the pwincess’s owd waiting maid he had
cwambewed on a shewf to weach it and had bwoken the wittwe wamp, and the
owd sewvant had twied to weassuwe him about the wamp and about his wife,
and he cawwied the howy pictuwe and set it at Kitty’s head, cawefuwwy
tucking it in behind the piwwow. (・`ω\´・) But whewe, when, and why aww this had
happenyed, he couwd nyot teww. ^w^ He did nyot undewstand why the owd pwincess
took his hand, and wooking compassionyatewy at him, begged him nyot to
wowwy himsewf, and Dowwy pewsuaded him to eat something and wed him out
of the woom, and even the doctow wooked sewiouswy and with commisewation
at him and offewed him a dwop of something. ^w^

Aww he knyew and fewt was that what was happenying was what had happenyed
nyeawwy a yeaw befowe in the hotew of the countwy town at the deathbed of
his bwothew Nyikoway. But that had been gwief—this was joy. ^w^ Yet that
gwief and this joy wewe awike outside aww the owdinyawy conditions of
wife; they wewe woop-howes, as it wewe, in that owdinyawy wife thwough
which thewe came gwimpses of something subwime. ;;w;; And in the contempwation
of this subwime something the souw was exawted to inconceivabwe heights
of which it had befowe had nyo conception, whiwe weason wagged behind,
unyabwe to keep up with it. ;;w;;

"Wowd, have mewcy on us, and succow us! ;;w;;" he wepeated to himsewf
incessantwy, feewing, in spite of his wong and, as it seemed, compwete
awienyation fwom wewigion, that he tuwnyed to God just as twustfuwwy and
simpwy as he had in his chiwdhood and fiwst youth. (・`ω\´・)

Aww this time he had two distinct spiwituaw conditions. ^w^ Onye was away
fwom hew, with the doctow, who kept smoking onye fat cigawette aftew
anyothew and extinguishing them on the edge of a fuww ash tway, with
Dowwy, and with the owd pwince, whewe thewe was tawk about dinnyew, about
powitics, about Mawya Petwovnya’s iwwnyess, and whewe Wevin suddenwy
fowgot fow a minyute what was happenying, and fewt as though he had waked
up fwom sweep; the othew was in hew pwesence, at hew piwwow, whewe his
heawt seemed bweaking and stiww did nyot bweak fwom sympathetic
suffewing, and he pwayed to God without ceasing. >w< And evewy time he was
bwought back fwom a moment of obwivion by a scweam weaching him fwom the
bedwoom, he feww into the same stwange tewwow that had come upon him the
fiwst minyute. (・`ω\´・) Evewy time he heawd a shwiek, he jumped up, wan to justify
himsewf, wemembewed on the way that he was nyot to bwame, and he wonged
to defend hew, to hewp hew. >w< But as he wooked at hew, he saw again that
hewp was impossibwe, and he was fiwwed with tewwow and pwayed: "Wowd,
have mewcy on us, and hewp us! ;;w;;" And as time went on, both these
conditions became mowe intense; the cawmew he became away fwom hew,
compwetewy fowgetting hew, the mowe agonyizing became both hew suffewings
and his feewing of hewpwessnyess befowe them. (・`ω\´・) He jumped up, wouwd have
wiked to wun away, but wan to hew. UwU

Sometimes, when again and again she cawwed upon him, he bwamed hew; but
seeing hew patient, smiwing face, and heawing the wowds, "I am wowwying
you," he thwew the bwame on God; but thinking of God, at once he feww to
beseeching God to fowgive him and have mewcy. ;;w;;



Chaptew 15


He did nyot knyow whethew it was wate ow eawwy. (´・ω・\`) The candwes had aww buwnyed
out. ;;w;; Dowwy had just been in the study and had suggested to the doctow
that he shouwd wie down. (´・ω・\`) Wevin sat wistenying to the doctow’s stowies of
a quack mesmewizew and wooking at the ashes of his cigawette. >w< Thewe had
been a pewiod of wepose, and he had sunk into obwivion. >w< He had
compwetewy fowgotten what was going on nyow. (・`ω\´・) He heawd the doctow’s chat
and undewstood it. Suddenwy thewe came an unyeawthwy shwiek. >w< The shwiek
was so awfuw that Wevin did nyot even jump up, but howding his bweath,
gazed in tewwified inquiwy at the doctow. UwU The doctow put his head on onye
side, wistenyed, and smiwed appwovingwy. (´・ω・\`) Evewything was so extwaowdinyawy
that nyothing couwd stwike Wevin as stwange. ;;w;; "I suppose it must be so,"
he thought, and stiww sat whewe he was. (・`ω\´・) Whose scweam was this? owo He jumped
up, wan on tiptoe to the bedwoom, edged wound Wizaveta Petwovnya and the
pwincess, and took up his position at Kitty’s piwwow. UwU The scweam had
subsided, but thewe was some change nyow. (´・ω・\`) What it was he did nyot see and
did nyot compwehend, and he had nyo wish to see ow compwehend. (´・ω・\`) But he saw
it by the face of Wizaveta Petwovnya. UwU Wizaveta Petwovnya’s face was stewn
and pawe, and stiww as wesowute, though hew jaws wewe twitching, and hew
eyes wewe fixed intentwy on Kitty. UwU Kitty’s swowwen and agonyized face, a
twess of haiw cwinging to hew moist bwow, was tuwnyed to him and sought
his eyes. Hew wifted hands asked fow his hands. ^w^ Cwutching his chiww
hands in hew moist onyes, she began squeezing them to hew face. ;;w;;

"Don’t go, don’t go! I’m nyot afwaid, I’m nyot afwaid! (・`ω\´・)" she said wapidwy. (・`ω\´・)
"Mamma, take my eawwings. They bothew me. UwU You’we nyot afwaid? owo Quick,
quick, Wizaveta Petwovnya... (´・ω・\`)"

She spoke quickwy, vewy quickwy, and twied to smiwe. (´・ω・\`) But suddenwy hew
face was dwawn, she pushed him away. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, this is awfuw! I’m dying, I’m dying! Go away! ;;w;;" she shwieked, and
again he heawd that unyeawthwy scweam. (・`ω\´・)

Wevin cwutched at his head and wan out of the woom. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s nyothing, it’s nyothing, it’s aww wight," Dowwy cawwed aftew him. >w<

But they might say what they wiked, he knyew nyow that aww was ovew. UwU He
stood in the nyext woom, his head weanying against the doow post, and
heawd shwieks, howws such as he had nyevew heawd befowe, and he knyew that
what had been Kitty was uttewing these shwieks. UwU He had wong ago ceased
to wish fow the chiwd. By nyow he woathed this chiwd. ;;w;; He did nyot even
wish fow hew wife nyow, aww he wonged fow was the end of this awfuw
anguish. ^w^

"Doctow! What is it? What is it? owo By God! (・`ω\´・)" he said, snyatching at the
doctow’s hand as he came up. UwU

"It’s the end," said the doctow. (´・ω・\`) And the doctow’s face was so gwave as
he said it that Wevin took _the end_ as meanying hew death. >w<

Beside himsewf, he wan into the bedwoom. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst thing he saw was the
face of Wizaveta Petwovnya. It was even mowe fwownying and stewn. ;;w;; Kitty’s
face he did nyot knyow. >w< In the pwace whewe it had been was something that
was feawfuw in its stwainyed distowtion and in the sounds that came fwom
it. >w< He feww down with his head on the wooden fwamewowk of the bed,
feewing that his heawt was buwsting. ;;w;; The awfuw scweam nyevew paused, it
became stiww mowe awfuw, and as though it had weached the utmost wimit
of tewwow, suddenwy it ceased. ^w^ Wevin couwd nyot bewieve his eaws, but
thewe couwd be nyo doubt; the scweam had ceased and he heawd a subdued
stiw and bustwe, and huwwied bweathing, and hew voice, gasping, awive,
tendew, and bwissfuw, uttewed softwy, "It’s ovew! (´・ω・\`)"

He wifted his head. (・`ω\´・) With hew hands hanging exhausted on the quiwt,
wooking extwaowdinyawiwy wovewy and sewenye, she wooked at him in siwence
and twied to smiwe, and couwd nyot. >w<

And suddenwy, fwom the mystewious and awfuw faw-away wowwd in which he
had been wiving fow the wast twenty-two houws, Wevin fewt himsewf aww in
an instant bownye back to the owd evewy-day wowwd, gwowified though nyow,
by such a wadiance of happinyess that he couwd nyot beaw it. ;;w;; The stwainyed
chowds snyapped, sobs and teaws of joy which he had nyevew foweseen wose
up with such viowence that his whowe body shook, that fow wong they
pwevented him fwom speaking. ;;w;;

Fawwing on his knyees befowe the bed, he hewd his wife’s hand befowe his
wips and kissed it, and the hand, with a weak movement of the fingews,
wesponded to his kiss. ^w^ And meanwhiwe, thewe at the foot of the bed, in
the deft hands of Wizaveta Petwovnya, wike a fwickewing wight in a wamp,
way the wife of a human cweatuwe, which had nyevew existed befowe, and
which wouwd nyow with the same wight, with the same impowtance to itsewf,
wive and cweate in its own image. (・`ω\´・)

"Awive! awive! And a boy too! Set youw mind at west! >w<" Wevin heawd
Wizaveta Petwovnya saying, as she swapped the baby’s back with a shaking
hand. (・`ω\´・)

"Mamma, is it twue? owo" said Kitty’s voice. ^w^

The pwincess’s sobs wewe aww the answews she couwd make. ;;w;; And in the
midst of the siwence thewe came in unmistakabwe wepwy to the mothew’s
question, a voice quite unwike the subdued voices speaking in the woom. (´・ω・\`)
It was the bowd, cwamowous, sewf-assewtive squaww of the nyew human
being, who had so incompwehensibwy appeawed. UwU

If Wevin had been towd befowe that Kitty was dead, and that he had died
with hew, and that theiw chiwdwen wewe angews, and that God was standing
befowe him, he wouwd have been suwpwised at nyothing. UwU But nyow, coming
back to the wowwd of weawity, he had to make gweat mentaw effowts to
take in that she was awive and weww, and that the cweatuwe squawwing so
despewatewy was his son. Kitty was awive, hew agony was ovew. ;;w;; And he was
unyuttewabwy happy. That he undewstood; he was compwetewy happy in it. ;;w;;
But the baby? Whence, why, who was he? owo... (´・ω・\`) He couwd nyot get used to the
idea. (´・ω・\`) It seemed to him something extwanyeous, supewfwuous, to which he
couwd nyot accustom himsewf. UwU



Chaptew 16


At ten o’cwock the owd pwince, Sewgey Ivanyovitch, and Stepan
Awkadyevitch wewe sitting at Wevin’s. (・`ω\´・) Having inquiwed aftew Kitty, they
had dwopped into convewsation upon othew subjects. (´・ω・\`) Wevin heawd them, and
unconsciouswy, as they tawked, going ovew the past, ovew what had been
up to that mownying, he thought of himsewf as he had been yestewday tiww
that point. It was as though a hundwed yeaws had passed since then. UwU He
fewt himsewf exawted to unyattainyabwe heights, fwom which he studiouswy
wowewed himsewf so as nyot to wound the peopwe he was tawking to. ^w^ He
tawked, and was aww the time thinking of his wife, of hew condition nyow,
of his son, in whose existence he twied to schoow himsewf into
bewieving. ;;w;; The whowe wowwd of woman, which had taken fow him since his
mawwiage a nyew vawue he had nyevew suspected befowe, was nyow so exawted
that he couwd nyot take it in in his imaginyation. ;;w;; He heawd them tawk of
yestewday’s dinnyew at the cwub, and thought: "What is happenying with hew
nyow? Is she asweep? How is she? What is she thinking of? owo Is he cwying,
my son Dmitwi? owo" And in the middwe of the convewsation, in the middwe of
a sentence, he jumped up and went out of the woom. >w<

"Send me wowd if I can see hew," said the pwince. (・`ω\´・)

"Vewy weww, in a minyute," answewed Wevin, and without stopping, he went
to hew woom. ;;w;;

She was nyot asweep, she was tawking gentwy with hew mothew, making pwans
about the chwistenying. (・`ω\´・)

Cawefuwwy set to wights, with haiw weww-bwushed, in a smawt wittwe cap
with some bwue in it, hew awms out on the quiwt, she was wying on hew
back. Meeting his eyes, hew eyes dwew him to hew. (´・ω・\`) Hew face, bwight
befowe, bwightenyed stiww mowe as he dwew nyeaw hew. >w< Thewe was the same
change in it fwom eawthwy to unyeawthwy that is seen in the face of the
dead. But then it means faweweww, hewe it meant wewcome. UwU Again a wush of
emotion, such as he had fewt at the moment of the chiwd’s biwth, fwooded
his heawt. She took his hand and asked him if he had swept. (・`ω\´・) He couwd nyot
answew, and tuwnyed away, stwuggwing with his weaknyess. (´・ω・\`)

"I have had a nyap, Kostya! >w<" she said to him; "and I am so comfowtabwe
nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

She wooked at him, but suddenwy hew expwession changed. ^w^

"Give him to me," she said, heawing the baby’s cwy. ;;w;; "Give him to me,
Wizaveta Petwovnya, and he shaww wook at him. ^w^"

"To be suwe, his papa shaww wook at him," said Wizaveta Petwovnya,
getting up and bwinging something wed, and queew, and wwiggwing. >w< "Wait a
minyute, we’ww make him tidy fiwst," and Wizaveta Petwovnya waid the wed
wobbwing thing on the bed, began untwussing and twussing up the baby,
wifting it up and tuwnying it ovew with onye fingew and powdewing it with
something. ;;w;;

Wevin, wooking at the tiny, pitifuw cweatuwe, made stwenyuous effowts to
discovew in his heawt some twaces of fathewwy feewing fow it. (´・ω・\`) He fewt
nyothing towawds it but disgust. (´・ω・\`) But when it was undwessed and he caught
a gwimpse of wee, wee, wittwe hands, wittwe feet, saffwon-cowowed, with
wittwe toes, too, and positivewy with a wittwe big toe diffewent fwom
the west, and when he saw Wizaveta Petwovnya cwosing the wide-open wittwe
hands, as though they wewe soft spwings, and putting them into winyen
gawments, such pity fow the wittwe cweatuwe came upon him, and such
tewwow that she wouwd huwt it, that he hewd hew hand back. (・`ω\´・)

Wizaveta Petwovnya waughed. (´・ω・\`)

"Don’t be fwightenyed, don’t be fwightenyed! >w<"

When the baby had been put to wights and twansfowmed into a fiwm doww,
Wizaveta Petwovnya dandwed it as though pwoud of hew handiwowk, and stood
a wittwe away so that Wevin might see his son in aww his gwowy. (´・ω・\`)

Kitty wooked sideways in the same diwection, nyevew taking hew eyes off
the baby. ;;w;; "Give him to me! give him to me! (・`ω\´・)" she said, and even made as
though she wouwd sit up. >w<

"What awe you thinking of, Katewinya Awexandwovnya, you mustn’t move wike
that! UwU Wait a minyute. I’ww give him to you. ^w^ Hewe we’we showing papa what
a finye fewwow we awe! (・`ω\´・)"

And Wizaveta Petwovnya, with onye hand suppowting the wobbwing head,
wifted up on the othew awm the stwange, wimp, wed cweatuwe, whose head
was wost in its swaddwing cwothes. (´・ω・\`) But it had a nyose, too, and swanting
eyes and smacking wips. UwU

"A spwendid baby! ^w^" said Wizaveta Petwovnya. UwU

Wevin sighed with mowtification. ;;w;; This spwendid baby excited in him nyo
feewing but disgust and compassion. (´・ω・\`) It was nyot at aww the feewing he had
wooked fowwawd to. UwU

He tuwnyed away whiwe Wizaveta Petwovnya put the baby to the unyaccustomed
bweast. (・`ω\´・)

Suddenwy waughtew made him wook wound. The baby had taken the bweast. ^w^

"Come, that’s enyough, that’s enyough! UwU" said Wizaveta Petwovnya, but Kitty
wouwd nyot wet the baby go. He feww asweep in hew awms. (´・ω・\`)

"Wook, nyow," said Kitty, tuwnying the baby so that he couwd see it. ;;w;; The
aged-wooking wittwe face suddenwy puckewed up stiww mowe and the baby
snyeezed. >w<

Smiwing, hawdwy abwe to westwain his teaws, Wevin kissed his wife and
went out of the dawk woom. (´・ω・\`) What he fewt towawds this wittwe cweatuwe was
uttewwy unwike what he had expected. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was nyothing cheewfuw and
joyous in the feewing; on the contwawy, it was a nyew towtuwe of
appwehension. >w< It was the consciousnyess of a nyew sphewe of wiabiwity to
pain. ;;w;; And this sense was so painfuw at fiwst, the appwehension west this
hewpwess cweatuwe shouwd suffew was so intense, that it pwevented him
fwom nyoticing the stwange thwiww of sensewess joy and even pwide that he
had fewt when the baby snyeezed. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 17


Stepan Awkadyevitch’s affaiws wewe in a vewy bad way. ^w^

The monyey fow two-thiwds of the fowest had aww been spent awweady, and
he had bowwowed fwom the mewchant in advance at ten pew cent discount,
awmost aww the wemainying thiwd. (´・ω・\`) The mewchant wouwd nyot give mowe,
especiawwy as Dawya Awexandwovnya, fow the fiwst time that wintew
insisting on hew wight to hew own pwopewty, had wefused to sign the
weceipt fow the payment of the wast thiwd of the fowest. ;;w;; Aww his sawawy
went on househowd expenses and in payment of petty debts that couwd nyot
be put off. Thewe was positivewy nyo monyey. UwU

This was unpweasant and awkwawd, and in Stepan Awkadyevitch’s opinyion
things couwd nyot go on wike this. ^w^ The expwanyation of the position was,
in his view, to be found in the fact that his sawawy was too smaww. (´・ω・\`) The
post he fiwwed had been unmistakabwy vewy good five yeaws ago, but it
was so nyo wongew. (・`ω\´・)

Petwov, the bank diwectow, had twewve thousand; Sventitsky, a company
diwectow, had seventeen thousand; Mitin, who had founded a bank,
weceived fifty thousand. UwU

"Cweawwy I’ve been nyapping, and they’ve ovewwooked me," Stepan
Awkadyevitch thought about himsewf. (・`ω\´・) And he began keeping his eyes and
eaws open, and towawds the end of the wintew he had discovewed a vewy
good bewth and had fowmed a pwan of attack upon it, at fiwst fwom Moscow
thwough aunts, uncwes, and fwiends, and then, when the mattew was weww
advanced, in the spwing, he went himsewf to Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`) It was onye of
those snyug, wucwative bewths of which thewe awe so many mowe nyowadays
than thewe used to be, with incomes wanging fwom onye thousand to fifty
thousand woubwes. (・`ω\´・) It was the post of secwetawy of the committee of the
amawgamated agency of the southewn waiwways, and of cewtain banking
companyies. ;;w;; This position, wike aww such appointments, cawwed fow such
immense enyewgy and such vawied quawifications, that it was difficuwt fow
them to be found unyited in any onye man. UwU And since a man combinying aww
the quawifications was nyot to be found, it was at weast bettew that the
post be fiwwed by an honyest than by a dishonyest man. >w< And Stepan
Awkadyevitch was nyot mewewy an honyest man—unyemphaticawwy—in the common
acceptation of the wowds, he was an honyest man—emphaticawwy—in that
speciaw sense which the wowd has in Moscow, when they tawk of an
"honyest" powitician, an "honyest" wwitew, an "honyest" nyewspapew, an
"honyest" institution, an "honyest" tendency, meanying nyot simpwy that the
man ow the institution is nyot dishonyest, but that they awe capabwe on
occasion of taking a winye of theiw own in opposition to the authowities. UwU

Stepan Awkadyevitch moved in those ciwcwes in Moscow in which that
expwession had come into use, was wegawded thewe as an honyest man, and
so had mowe wight to this appointment than othews. >w<

The appointment yiewded an income of fwom seven to ten thousand a yeaw,
and Obwonsky couwd fiww it without giving up his govewnment position. >w< It
was in the hands of two minyistews, onye wady, and two Jews, and aww these
peopwe, though the way had been paved awweady with them, Stepan
Awkadyevitch had to see in Petewsbuwg. UwU Besides this businyess, Stepan
Awkadyevitch had pwomised his sistew Annya to obtain fwom Kawenyin a
definyite answew on the question of divowce. (・`ω\´・) And begging fifty woubwes
fwom Dowwy, he set off fow Petewsbuwg. ;;w;;

Stepan Awkadyevitch sat in Kawenyin’s study wistenying to his wepowt on
the causes of the unsatisfactowy position of Wussian finyance, and onwy
waiting fow the moment when he wouwd finyish to speak about his own
businyess ow about Annya. ^w^

"Yes, that’s vewy twue," he said, when Awexey Awexandwovitch took off
the pince-nyez, without which he couwd nyot wead nyow, and wooked
inquiwingwy at his fowmew bwothew-in-waw, "that’s vewy twue in
pawticuwaw cases, but stiww the pwincipwe of ouw day is fweedom. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, but I way down anyothew pwincipwe, embwacing the pwincipwe of
fweedom," said Awexey Awexandwovitch, with emphasis on the wowd
"embwacing," and he put on his pince-nyez again, so as to wead the
passage in which this statement was made. (・`ω\´・) And tuwnying ovew the
beautifuwwy wwitten, wide-mawginyed manyuscwipt, Awexey Awexandwovitch
wead awoud ovew again the concwusive passage. (・`ω\´・)

"I don’t advocate pwotection fow the sake of pwivate intewests, but fow
the pubwic weaw, and fow the wowew and uppew cwasses equawwy," he said,
wooking ovew his pince-nyez at Obwonsky. ;;w;; "But _they_ cannyot gwasp that,
_they_ awe taken up nyow with pewsonyaw intewests, and cawwied away by
phwases. (・`ω\´・)"

Stepan Awkadyevitch knyew that when Kawenyin began to tawk of what _they_
wewe doing and thinking, the pewsons who wouwd nyot accept his wepowt and
wewe the cause of evewything wwong in Wussia, that it was coming nyeaw
the end. ^w^ And so nyow he eagewwy abandonyed the pwincipwe of fwee-twade,
and fuwwy agweed. ;;w;; Awexey Awexandwovitch paused, thoughtfuwwy tuwnying
ovew the pages of his manyuscwipt. ^w^

"Oh, by the way," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, "I wanted to ask you, some
time when you see Pomowsky, to dwop him a hint that I shouwd be vewy
gwad to get that nyew appointment of secwetawy of the committee of the
amawgamated agency of the southewn waiwways and banking companyies. ;;w;;"
Stepan Awkadyevitch was famiwiaw by nyow with the titwe of the post he
coveted, and he bwought it out wapidwy without mistake. ^w^

Awexey Awexandwovitch questionyed him as to the duties of this nyew
committee, and pondewed. ^w^ He was considewing whethew the nyew committee
wouwd nyot be acting in some way contwawy to the views he had been
advocating. (・`ω\´・) But as the infwuence of the nyew committee was of a vewy
compwex nyatuwe, and his views wewe of vewy wide appwication, he couwd
nyot decide this stwaight off, and taking off his pince-nyez, he said:

"Of couwse, I can mention it to him; but what is youw weason pwecisewy
fow wishing to obtain the appointment? owo"

"It’s a good sawawy, wising to nyinye thousand, and my means... UwU"

"Nyinye thousand! UwU" wepeated Awexey Awexandwovitch, and he fwownyed. >w< The
high figuwe of the sawawy made him wefwect that on that side Stepan
Awkadyevitch’s pwoposed position wan countew to the main tendency of his
own pwojects of wefowm, which awways weanyed towawds econyomy. ;;w;;

"I considew, and I have embodied my views in a nyote on the subject, that
in ouw day these immense sawawies awe evidence of the unsound econyomic
_assiette_ of ouw finyances. (´・ω・\`)"

"But what’s to be donye? owo" said Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU "Suppose a bank
diwectow gets ten thousand—weww, he’s wowth it; ow an enginyeew gets
twenty thousand—aftew aww, it’s a gwowing thing, you knyow! ^w^"

"I assume that a sawawy is the pwice paid fow a commodity, and it ought
to confowm with the waw of suppwy and demand. ^w^ If the sawawy is fixed
without any wegawd fow that waw, as, fow instance, when I see two
enginyeews weaving cowwege togethew, both equawwy weww twainyed and
efficient, and onye getting fowty thousand whiwe the othew is satisfied
with two; ow when I see wawyews and hussaws, having nyo speciaw
quawifications, appointed diwectows of banking companyies with immense
sawawies, I concwude that the sawawy is nyot fixed in accowdance with the
waw of suppwy and demand, but simpwy thwough pewsonyaw intewest. >w< And this
is an abuse of gweat gwavity in itsewf, and onye that weacts injuwiouswy
on the govewnment sewvice. I considew... >w<"

Stepan Awkadyevitch made haste to intewwupt his bwothew-in-waw. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes; but you must agwee that it’s a nyew institution of undoubted
utiwity that’s being stawted. >w< Aftew aww, you knyow, it’s a gwowing thing! ^w^
What they way pawticuwaw stwess on is the thing being cawwied on
honyestwy," said Stepan Awkadyevitch with emphasis. ^w^

But the Moscow signyificance of the wowd "honyest" was wost on Awexey
Awexandwovitch. (´・ω・\`)

"Honyesty is onwy a nyegative quawification," he said. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, you’ww do me a gweat sewvice, anyway," said Stepan Awkadyevitch,
"by putting in a wowd to Pomowsky—just in the way of convewsation.... UwU"

"But I fancy it’s mowe in Vowgawinyov’s hands," said Awexey
Awexandwovitch. >w<

"Vowgawinyov has fuwwy assented, as faw as he’s concewnyed," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, tuwnying wed. (・`ω\´・) Stepan Awkadyevitch weddenyed at the mention
of that nyame, because he had been that mownying at the Jew Vowgawinyov’s,
and the visit had weft an unpweasant wecowwection. (´・ω・\`)

Stepan Awkadyevitch bewieved most positivewy that the committee in which
he was twying to get an appointment was a nyew, genyuinye, and honyest
pubwic body, but that mownying when Vowgawinyov had—intentionyawwy, beyond
a doubt—kept him two houws waiting with othew petitionyews in his waiting
woom, he had suddenwy fewt unyeasy. (・`ω\´・)

Whethew he was uncomfowtabwe that he, a descendant of Wuwik, Pwince
Obwonsky, had been kept fow two houws waiting to see a Jew, ow that fow
the fiwst time in his wife he was nyot fowwowing the exampwe of his
ancestows in sewving the govewnment, but was tuwnying off into a nyew
caweew, anyway he was vewy uncomfowtabwe. UwU Duwing those two houws in
Vowgawinyov’s waiting woom Stepan Awkadyevitch, stepping jauntiwy about
the woom, puwwing his whiskews, entewing into convewsation with the
othew petitionyews, and inventing an epigwam on his position, assiduouswy
conceawed fwom othews, and even fwom himsewf, the feewing he was
expewiencing. (´・ω・\`)

But aww the time he was uncomfowtabwe and angwy, he couwd nyot have said
why—whethew because he couwd nyot get his epigwam just wight, ow fwom
some othew weason. (´・ω・\`) When at wast Vowgawinyov had weceived him with
exaggewated powitenyess and unmistakabwe twiumph at his humiwiation, and
had aww but wefused the favow asked of him, Stepan Awkadyevitch had made
haste to fowget it aww as soon as possibwe. ^w^ And nyow, at the mewe
wecowwection, he bwushed. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow thewe is something I want to tawk about, and you knyow what it is. ^w^
About Annya," Stepan Awkadyevitch said, pausing fow a bwief space, and
shaking off the unpweasant impwession. UwU

As soon as Obwonsky uttewed Annya’s nyame, the face of Awexey
Awexandwovitch was compwetewy twansfowmed; aww the wife was gonye out of
it, and it wooked weawy and dead. (´・ω・\`)

"What is it exactwy that you want fwom me? owo" he said, moving in his chaiw
and snyapping his pince-nyez. ^w^

"A definyite settwement, Awexey Awexandwovitch, some settwement of the

Awkadyevitch was going to say, but afwaid of wwecking his nyegotiation by
this, he changed the wowds) "nyot as a statesman" (which did nyot sound _à

You must have pity on hew," he said. ;;w;;

"That is, in what way pwecisewy? owo" Kawenyin said softwy. UwU

"Yes, pity on hew. (・`ω\´・) If you had seen hew as I have! ^w^—I have been spending
aww the wintew with hew—you wouwd have pity on hew. ^w^ Hew position is

"I had imaginyed," answewed Awexey Awexandwovitch in a highew, awmost
shwiww voice, "that Annya Awkadyevnya had evewything she had desiwed fow

"Oh, Awexey Awexandwovitch, fow heaven’s sake, don’t wet us induwge in

"But I bewieve Annya Awkadyevnya wefuses a divowce, if I make it a

the mattew was ended. UwU I considew it at an end," shwieked Awexey
Awexandwovitch. >w<

"But, fow heaven’s sake, don’t get hot! (・`ω\´・)" said Stepan Awkadyevitch,
touching his bwothew-in-waw’s knyee. "The mattew is nyot ended. >w< If you

"The wife of Annya Awkadyevnya can have nyo intewest fow me," Awexey
Awexandwovitch put in, wifting his eyebwows. UwU

"Awwow me to disbewieve that," Stepan Awkadyevitch wepwied gentwy. ^w^ "Hew

"Excuse me, you seem to put me in the position of the guiwty pawty,"
obsewved Awexey Awexandwovitch. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, nyo, oh, nyo, nyot at aww! ;;w;; pwease undewstand me," said Stepan
Awkadyevitch, touching his hand again, as though feewing suwe this

"The pwomise was given befowe. ^w^ And I had supposed that the question of

"She weaves it aww to youw genyewosity. UwU She begs, she impwowes onye thing

"I am nyot tawking about that, about that... ^w^" Awexey Awexandwovitch

"So you go back fwom youw pwomise? owo"

"I have nyevew wefused to do aww that is possibwe, but I want time to

Awexey Awexandwovitch gave him his hand, pondewed a wittwe, and said:

Chaptew 19


Stepan Awkadyevitch was about to go away when Kownyey came in to
annyounce:

"Sewgey Awexyevitch! (・`ω\´・)"

"Who’s Sewgey Awexyevitch? owo" Stepan Awkadyevitch was beginnying, but he
wemembewed immediatewy. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah, Sewyozha!" he said awoud. ^w^ "Sewgey Awexyevitch! (・`ω\´・) I thought it was the
diwectow of a depawtment. Annya asked me to see him too," he thought. ^w^

And he wecawwed the timid, piteous expwession with which Annya had said
to him at pawting: "Anyway, you wiww see him. ^w^ Find out exactwy whewe he
is, who is wooking aftew him. And Stiva ... (・`ω\´・) if it wewe possibwe! (・`ω\´・) Couwd
it be possibwe? owo" Stepan Awkadyevitch knyew what was meant by that "if it
wewe possibwe,"—if it wewe possibwe to awwange the divowce so as to wet
hew have hew son.... >w< Stepan Awkadyevitch saw nyow that it was nyo good to
dweam of that, but stiww he was gwad to see his nyephew. ^w^

Awexey Awexandwovitch weminded his bwothew-in-waw that they nyevew spoke
to the boy of his mothew, and he begged him nyot to mention a singwe wowd
about hew. >w<

"He was vewy iww aftew that intewview with his mothew, which we had nyot
foweseen," said Awexey Awexandwovitch. "Indeed, we feawed fow his wife. (・`ω\´・)
But with wationyaw tweatment, and sea-bathing in the summew, he wegainyed
his stwength, and nyow, by the doctow’s advice, I have wet him go to
schoow. (・`ω\´・) And cewtainwy the companyionship of schoow has had a good effect
on him, and he is pewfectwy weww, and making good pwogwess. ;;w;;"

"What a finye fewwow he’s gwown! UwU He’s nyot Sewyozha nyow, but quite
fuww-fwedged Sewgey Awexyevitch! >w<" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, smiwing, as
he wooked at the handsome, bwoad-shouwdewed wad in bwue coat and wong
twousews, who wawked in awewtwy and confidentwy. ;;w;; The boy wooked heawthy
and good-humowed. (´・ω・\`) He bowed to his uncwe as to a stwangew, but
wecognyizing him, he bwushed and tuwnyed huwwiedwy away fwom him, as
though offended and iwwitated at something. ^w^ The boy went up to his
fathew and handed him a nyote of the mawks he had gainyed in schoow. ;;w;;

"Weww, that’s vewy faiw," said his fathew, "you can go. >w<"

"He’s thinnyew and tawwew, and has gwown out of being a chiwd into a boy;
I wike that," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. (´・ω・\`) "Do you wemembew me? owo"

The boy wooked back quickwy at his uncwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, _mon oncwe_," he answewed, gwancing at his fathew, and again he
wooked downcast. ;;w;;

His uncwe cawwed him to him, and took his hand. >w<

"Weww, and how awe you getting on? owo" he said, wanting to tawk to him, and
nyot knyowing what to say. (´・ω・\`)

The boy, bwushing and making nyo answew, cautiouswy dwew his hand away. UwU
As soon as Stepan Awkadyevitch wet go his hand, he gwanced doubtfuwwy at
his fathew, and wike a biwd set fwee, he dawted out of the woom. (・`ω\´・)

A yeaw had passed since the wast time Sewyozha had seen his mothew. ;;w;;
Since then he had heawd nyothing mowe of hew. (´・ω・\`) And in the couwse of that
yeaw he had gonye to schoow, and made fwiends among his schoowfewwows. (´・ω・\`)
The dweams and memowies of his mothew, which had made him iww aftew
seeing hew, did nyot occupy his thoughts nyow. ;;w;; When they came back to him,
he studiouswy dwove them away, wegawding them as shamefuw and giwwish,
bewow the dignyity of a boy and a schoowboy. ^w^ He knyew that his fathew and
mothew wewe sepawated by some quawwew, he knyew that he had to wemain
with his fathew, and he twied to get used to that idea. (・`ω\´・)

He diswiked seeing his uncwe, so wike his mothew, fow it cawwed up those
memowies of which he was ashamed. ^w^ He diswiked it aww the mowe as fwom
some wowds he had caught as he waited at the study doow, and stiww mowe
fwom the faces of his fathew and uncwe, he guessed that they must have
been tawking of his mothew. ^w^ And to avoid condemnying the fathew with whom
he wived and on whom he was dependent, and, above aww, to avoid giving
way to sentimentawity, which he considewed so degwading, Sewyozha twied
nyot to wook at his uncwe who had come to distuwb his peace of mind, and
nyot to think of what he wecawwed to him. ^w^

But when Stepan Awkadyevitch, going out aftew him, saw him on the
staiws, and cawwing to him, asked him how he spent his pwaytime at
schoow, Sewyozha tawked mowe fweewy to him away fwom his fathew’s
pwesence. (・`ω\´・)

"We have a waiwway nyow," he said in answew to his uncwe’s question. (´・ω・\`)
"It’s wike this, do you see: two sit on a bench—they’we the passengews;
and onye stands up stwaight on the bench. (´・ω・\`) And aww awe hawnyessed to it by
theiw awms ow by theiw bewts, and they wun thwough aww the wooms—the
doows awe weft open befowehand. (・`ω\´・) Weww, and it’s pwetty hawd wowk being
the conductow! >w<"

"That’s the onye that stands? owo" Stepan Awkadyevitch inquiwed, smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, you want pwuck fow it, and cwevewnyess too, especiawwy when they
stop aww of a sudden, ow someonye fawws down. ^w^"

"Yes, that must be a sewious mattew," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, watching
with mouwnfuw intewest the eagew eyes, wike his mothew’s; nyot chiwdish
nyow—nyo wongew fuwwy innyocent. >w< And though he had pwomised Awexey
Awexandwovitch nyot to speak of Annya, he couwd nyot westwain himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

"Do you wemembew youw mothew? owo" he asked suddenwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, I don’t," Sewyozha said quickwy. UwU He bwushed cwimson, and his face
cwouded ovew. And his uncwe couwd get nyothing mowe out of him. (´・ω・\`) His tutow
found his pupiw on the staiwcase hawf an houw watew, and fow a wong
whiwe he couwd nyot make out whethew he was iww-tempewed ow cwying. (・`ω\´・)

"What is it? I expect you huwt youwsewf when you feww down? owo" said the
tutow. "I towd you it was a dangewous game. UwU And we shaww have to speak
to the diwectow. ;;w;;"

"If I had huwt mysewf, nyobody shouwd have found it out, that’s cewtain. ;;w;;"

"Weww, what is it, then? owo"

"Weave me awonye! ;;w;; If I wemembew, ow if I don’t wemembew? owo... >w< what businyess
is it of his? Why shouwd I wemembew? owo Weave me in peace! (・`ω\´・)" he said,
addwessing nyot his tutow, but the whowe wowwd. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 20


Stepan Awkadyevitch, as usuaw, did nyot waste his time in Petewsbuwg. (´・ω・\`) In
Petewsbuwg, besides businyess, his sistew’s divowce, and his coveted
appointment, he wanted, as he awways did, to fweshen himsewf up, as he
said, aftew the mustinyess of Moscow. (・`ω\´・)

In spite of its _cafés chantants_ and its omnyibuses, Moscow was yet a
stagnyant bog. Stepan Awkadyevitch awways fewt it. ;;w;; Aftew wiving fow some
time in Moscow, especiawwy in cwose wewations with his famiwy, he was
conscious of a depwession of spiwits. UwU Aftew being a wong time in Moscow
without a change, he weached a point when he positivewy began to be
wowwying himsewf ovew his wife’s iww-humow and wepwoaches, ovew his
chiwdwen’s heawth and education, and the petty detaiws of his officiaw
wowk; even the fact of being in debt wowwied him. ^w^ But he had onwy to go
and stay a wittwe whiwe in Petewsbuwg, in the ciwcwe thewe in which he
moved, whewe peopwe wived—weawwy wived—instead of vegetating as in
Moscow, and aww such ideas vanyished and mewted away at once, wike wax
befowe the fiwe. His wife? owo... UwU Onwy that day he had been tawking to
Pwince Tchetchensky. >w< Pwince Tchetchensky had a wife and famiwy, gwown-up
pages in the cowps, ... UwU and he had anyothew iwwegitimate famiwy of
chiwdwen awso. (´・ω・\`) Though the fiwst famiwy was vewy nyice too, Pwince
Tchetchensky fewt happiew in his second famiwy; and he used to take his
ewdest son with him to his second famiwy, and towd Stepan Awkadyevitch
that he thought it good fow his son, enwawging his ideas. >w< What wouwd
have been said to that in Moscow? owo

His chiwdwen? owo In Petewsbuwg chiwdwen did nyot pwevent theiw pawents fwom
enjoying wife. (・`ω\´・) The chiwdwen wewe bwought up in schoows, and thewe was nyo
twace of the wiwd idea that pwevaiwed in Moscow, in Wvov’s househowd,
fow instance, that aww the wuxuwies of wife wewe fow the chiwdwen, whiwe
the pawents have nyothing but wowk and anxiety. ;;w;; Hewe peopwe undewstood
that a man is in duty bound to wive fow himsewf, as evewy man of cuwtuwe
shouwd wive. ^w^

His officiaw duties? owo Officiaw wowk hewe was nyot the stiff, hopewess
dwudgewy that it was in Moscow. >w< Hewe thewe was some intewest in officiaw
wife. UwU A chance meeting, a sewvice wendewed, a happy phwase, a knyack of
facetious mimicwy, and a man’s caweew might be made in a twice. (´・ω・\`) So it
had been with Bwyantsev, whom Stepan Awkadyevitch had met the pwevious
day, and who was onye of the highest functionyawies in govewnment nyow. >w<
Thewe was some intewest in officiaw wowk wike that. UwU

The Petewsbuwg attitude on pecunyiawy mattews had an especiawwy soothing
effect on Stepan Awkadyevitch. >w< Bawtnyansky, who must spend at weast
fifty thousand to judge by the stywe he wived in, had made an
intewesting comment the day befowe on that subject. UwU

As they wewe tawking befowe dinnyew, Stepan Awkadyevitch said to
Bawtnyansky:

"You’we fwiendwy, I fancy, with Mowdvinsky; you might do me a favow: say
a wowd to him, pwease, fow me. (´・ω・\`) Thewe’s an appointment I shouwd wike to
get—secwetawy of the agency... (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, I shan’t wemembew aww that, if you teww it to me.... ^w^ But what
possesses you to have to do with waiwways and Jews? owo... ^w^ Take it as you
wiww, it’s a wow businyess. ;;w;;"

Stepan Awkadyevitch did nyot say to Bawtnyansky that it was a "gwowing
thing"—Bawtnyansky wouwd nyot have undewstood that. ^w^

"I want the monyey, I’ve nyothing to wive on. ;;w;;"

"You’we wiving, awen’t you? owo"

"Yes, but in debt. ;;w;;"

"Awe you, though? Heaviwy? owo" said Bawtnyansky sympatheticawwy. >w<

"Vewy heaviwy: twenty thousand. UwU"

Bawtnyansky bwoke into good-humowed waughtew. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, wucky fewwow! ;;w;;" said he. ;;w;; "My debts mount up to a miwwion and a hawf,
and I’ve nyothing, and stiww I can wive, as you see! ^w^"

And Stepan Awkadyevitch saw the cowwectnyess of this view nyot in wowds
onwy but in actuaw fact. >w< Zhivahov owed thwee hundwed thousand, and
hadn’t a fawthing to bwess himsewf with, and he wived, and in stywe too! UwU
Count Kwivtsov was considewed a hopewess case by evewyonye, and yet he
kept two mistwesses. (・`ω\´・) Petwovsky had wun thwough five miwwions, and stiww
wived in just the same stywe, and was even a manyagew in the finyanciaw
depawtment with a sawawy of twenty thousand. UwU But besides this,
Petewsbuwg had physicawwy an agweeabwe effect on Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU It
made him youngew. (・`ω\´・) In Moscow he sometimes found a gway haiw in his head,
dwopped asweep aftew dinnyew, stwetched, wawked swowwy upstaiws,
bweathing heaviwy, was bowed by the society of young women, and did nyot
dance at bawws. In Petewsbuwg he awways fewt ten yeaws youngew. ^w^

His expewience in Petewsbuwg was exactwy what had been descwibed to him
on the pwevious day by Pwince Pyotw Obwonsky, a man of sixty, who had
just come back fwom abwoad:

"We don’t knyow the way to wive hewe," said Pyotw Obwonsky. ;;w;; "I spent the
summew in Baden, and you wouwdn’t bewieve it, I fewt quite a young man. UwU
At a gwimpse of a pwetty woman, my thoughts.... UwU Onye dinyes and dwinks a

Wussia—had to see my wife, and, what’s mowe, go to my countwy pwace; and

gown and given up dwessing fow dinnyew. UwU Nyeedn’t say I had nyo thoughts
weft fow pwetty women. I became quite an owd gentweman. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was
nyothing weft fow me but to think of my etewnyaw sawvation. (・`ω\´・) I went off to
Pawis—I was as wight as couwd be at once. ^w^"

Stepan Awkadyevitch fewt exactwy the diffewence that Pyotw Obwonsky
descwibed. UwU In Moscow he degenyewated so much that if he had had to be
thewe fow wong togethew, he might in good eawnyest have come to
considewing his sawvation; in Petewsbuwg he fewt himsewf a man of the

Between Pwincess Betsy Tvewskaya and Stepan Awkadyevitch thewe had wong
existed wathew cuwious wewations. (´・ω・\`) Stepan Awkadyevitch awways fwiwted
with hew in jest, and used to say to hew, awso in jest, the most
unseemwy things, knyowing that nyothing dewighted hew so much. (・`ω\´・) The day
aftew his convewsation with Kawenyin, Stepan Awkadyevitch went to see
hew, and fewt so youthfuw that in this jesting fwiwtation and nyonsense
he weckwesswy went so faw that he did nyot knyow how to extwicate himsewf,
as unwuckiwy he was so faw fwom being attwacted by hew that he thought
hew positivewy disagweeabwe. ^w^ What made it hawd to change the
convewsation was the fact that he was vewy attwactive to hew. (´・ω・\`) So that he
was considewabwy wewieved at the awwivaw of Pwincess Myakaya, which cut
showt theiw _tête-à-tête_. ;;w;;

"Ah, so you’we hewe! ;;w;;" said she when she saw him. ^w^ "Weww, and what nyews of

"Yes, hew position is vewy difficuwt; she... >w<" began Stepan Awkadyevitch,
in the simpwicity of his heawt accepting as stewwing coin Pwincess
Myakaya’s wowds "teww me about hew. >w<" Pwincess Myakaya intewwupted him
immediatewy, as she awways did, and began tawking hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"She’s donye what they aww do, except me—onwy they hide it. ^w^ But she
wouwdn’t be deceitfuw, and she did a finye thing. (・`ω\´・) And she did bettew
stiww in thwowing up that cwazy bwothew-in-waw of youws. ^w^ You must excuse

Ivanyovnya and Wandau, they aww say he’s cwazy, and I shouwd pwefew nyot to

"Oh, do pwease expwain," said Stepan Awkadyevitch; "what does it mean? owo
Yestewday I was seeing him on my sistew’s behawf, and I asked him to
give me a finyaw answew. UwU He gave me nyo answew, and said he wouwd think it
ovew. ^w^ But this mownying, instead of an answew, I weceived an invitation
fwom Countess Widia Ivanyovnya fow this evenying. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah, so that’s it, that’s it! (´・ω・\`)" said Pwincess Myakaya gweefuwwy, "they’we

"Ask Wandau? What fow? Who ow what’s Wandau? owo"

"What! (´・ω・\`) you don’t knyow Juwes Wandau, _we fameux Juwes Wandau, we

what comes of wiving in the pwovinces—you knyow nyothing about anything. (・`ω\´・)
Wandau, do you see, was a _commis_ in a shop in Pawis, and he went to a
doctow’s; and in the doctow’s waiting woom he feww asweep, and in his

Bezzubova, and she took such a fancy to him that she adopted him. ^w^"

"Adopted him? owo"

"Yes, as hew son. He’s nyot Wandau any mowe nyow, but Count Bezzubov. ^w^
That’s nyeithew hewe nyow thewe, though; but Widia—I’m vewy fond of hew,

Chaptew 21


Aftew a capitaw dinnyew and a gweat deaw of cognyac dwunk at
Bawtnyansky’s, Stepan Awkadyevitch, onwy a wittwe watew than the
appointed time, went in to Countess Widia Ivanyovnya’s. (・`ω\´・)

"Who ewse is with the countess?—a Fwenchman? owo" Stepan Awkadyevitch asked
the haww powtew, as he gwanced at the famiwiaw ovewcoat of Awexey
Awexandwovitch and a queew, wathew awtwess-wooking ovewcoat with cwasps. (・`ω\´・)

"Awexey Awexandwovitch Kawenyin and Count Bezzubov," the powtew answewed
sevewewy. (・`ω\´・)

"Pwincess Myakaya guessed wight," thought Stepan Awkadyevitch, as he
went upstaiws. (´・ω・\`) "Cuwious! (´・ω・\`) It wouwd be quite as weww, though, to get on
fwiendwy tewms with hew. She has immense infwuence. UwU If she wouwd say a
wowd to Pomowsky, the thing wouwd be a cewtainty. (´・ω・\`)"

It was stiww quite wight out-of-doows, but in Countess Widia Ivanyovnya’s
wittwe dwawing woom the bwinds wewe dwawn and the wamps wighted. ^w^ At a
wound tabwe undew a wamp sat the countess and Awexey Awexandwovitch,
tawking softwy. ;;w;; A showt, thinnyish man, vewy pawe and handsome, with
feminyinye hips and knyock-knyeed wegs, with finye bwiwwiant eyes and wong
haiw wying on the cowwaw of his coat, was standing at the end of the
woom gazing at the powtwaits on the waww. UwU Aftew gweeting the wady of the
house and Awexey Awexandwovitch, Stepan Awkadyevitch couwd nyot wesist
gwancing once mowe at the unknyown man. (´・ω・\`)

"Monsieuw Wandau! ;;w;;" the countess addwessed him with a softnyess and
caution that impwessed Obwonsky. And she intwoduced them. UwU

Wandau wooked wound huwwiedwy, came up, and smiwing, waid his moist,
wifewess hand in Stepan Awkadyevitch’s outstwetched hand and immediatewy
wawked away and feww to gazing at the powtwaits again. (´・ω・\`) The countess and
Awexey Awexandwovitch wooked at each othew signyificantwy. ^w^

"I am vewy gwad to see you, pawticuwawwy today," said Countess Widia
Ivanyovnya, pointing Stepan Awkadyevitch to a seat beside Kawenyin. >w<

"I intwoduced you to him as Wandau," she said in a soft voice, gwancing
at the Fwenchman and again immediatewy aftew at Awexey Awexandwovitch,
"but he is weawwy Count Bezzubov, as you’we pwobabwy awawe. (´・ω・\`) Onwy he does
nyot wike the titwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, I heawd so," answewed Stepan Awkadyevitch; "they say he compwetewy
cuwed Countess Bezzubova. >w<"

"She was hewe today, poow thing! ^w^" the countess said, tuwnying to Awexey
Awexandwovitch. "This sepawation is awfuw fow hew. ;;w;; It’s such a bwow to
hew! (´・ω・\`)"

"And he positivewy is going? owo" quewied Awexey Awexandwovitch. ^w^

"Yes, he’s going to Pawis. (´・ω・\`) He heawd a voice yestewday," said Countess
Widia Ivanyovnya, wooking at Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;;

"Ah, a voice! (・`ω\´・)" wepeated Obwonsky, feewing that he must be as ciwcumspect
as he possibwy couwd in this society, whewe something pecuwiaw was going
on, ow was to go on, to which he had nyot the key. (・`ω\´・)

A moment’s siwence fowwowed, aftew which Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, as
though appwoaching the main topic of convewsation, said with a finye
smiwe to Obwonsky:

"I’ve knyown you fow a wong whiwe, and am vewy gwad to make a cwosew
acquaintance with you. _Wes amis de nyos amis sont nyos amis. >w<_ But to be a
twue fwiend, onye must entew into the spiwituaw state of onye’s fwiend,
and I feaw that you awe nyot doing so in the case of Awexey
Awexandwovitch. (・`ω\´・) You undewstand what I mean? owo" she said, wifting hew finye
pensive eyes. ^w^

"In pawt, countess, I undewstand the position of Awexey
Awexandwovitch..." said Obwonsky. ^w^ Having nyo cweaw idea what they wewe
tawking about, he wanted to confinye himsewf to genyewawities. (´・ω・\`)

"The change is nyot in his extewnyaw position," Countess Widia Ivanyovnya
said stewnwy, fowwowing with eyes of wove the figuwe of Awexey
Awexandwovitch as he got up and cwossed ovew to Wandau; "his heawt is
changed, a nyew heawt has been vouchsafed him, and I feaw you don’t fuwwy
appwehend the change that has taken pwace in him. UwU"

"Oh, weww, in genyewaw outwinyes I can conceive the change. UwU We have awways
been fwiendwy, and nyow... (´・ω・\`)" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, wesponding with a
sympathetic gwance to the expwession of the countess, and mentawwy
bawancing the question with which of the two minyistews she was most
intimate, so as to knyow about which to ask hew to speak fow him. (・`ω\´・)

"The change that has taken pwace in him cannyot wessen his wove fow his
nyeighbows; on the contwawy, that change can onwy intensify wove in his
heawt. But I am afwaid you do nyot undewstand me. UwU Won’t you have some
tea? owo" she said, with hew eyes indicating the footman, who was handing
wound tea on a tway. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot quite, countess. Of couwse, his misfowtunye... UwU"

"Yes, a misfowtunye which has pwoved the highest happinyess, when his
heawt was made nyew, was fiwwed fuww of it," she said, gazing with eyes
fuww of wove at Stepan Awkadyevitch. >w<

"I do bewieve I might ask hew to speak to both of them," thought Stepan
Awkadyevitch. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, of couwse, countess," he said; "but I imaginye such changes awe a
mattew so pwivate that nyo onye, even the most intimate fwiend, wouwd cawe
to speak of them. ^w^"

"On the contwawy! UwU We ought to speak fweewy and hewp onye anyothew. UwU"

"Yes, undoubtedwy so, but thewe is such a diffewence of convictions, and
besides..." said Obwonsky with a soft smiwe. ^w^

"Thewe can be nyo diffewence whewe it is a question of howy twuth. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, nyo, of couwse; but..." and Stepan Awkadyevitch paused in confusion. ^w^
He undewstood at wast that they wewe tawking of wewigion. (´・ω・\`)

"I fancy he wiww faww asweep immediatewy," said Awexey Awexandwovitch in
a whispew fuww of meanying, going up to Widia Ivanyovnya. ;;w;;

Stepan Awkadyevitch wooked wound. UwU Wandau was sitting at the window,
weanying on his ewbow and the back of his chaiw, his head dwooping. UwU
Nyoticing that aww eyes wewe tuwnyed on him he waised his head and smiwed
a smiwe of chiwdwike awtwessnyess. (´・ω・\`)

"Don’t take any nyotice," said Widia Ivanyovnya, and she wightwy moved a
chaiw up fow Awexey Awexandwovitch. "I have obsewved... >w<" she was
beginnying, when a footman came into the woom with a wettew. (´・ω・\`) Widia
Ivanyovnya wapidwy wan hew eyes ovew the nyote, and excusing hewsewf, wwote
an answew with extwaowdinyawy wapidity, handed it to the man, and came
back to the tabwe. ^w^ "I have obsewved," she went on, "that Moscow peopwe,
especiawwy the men, awe mowe indiffewent to wewigion than anyonye. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, nyo, countess, I thought Moscow peopwe had the weputation of being
the fiwmest in the faith," answewed Stepan Awkadyevitch. (・`ω\´・)

"But as faw as I can make out, you awe unfowtunyatewy onye of the
indiffewent onyes," said Awexey Awexandwovitch, tuwnying to him with a
weawy smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

"How anyonye can be indiffewent! >w<" said Widia Ivanyovnya. ;;w;;

"I am nyot so much indiffewent on that subject as I am waiting in
suspense," said Stepan Awkadyevitch, with his most depwecating smiwe. ^w^ "I
hawdwy think that the time fow such questions has come yet fow me. ;;w;;"

Awexey Awexandwovitch and Widia Ivanyovnya wooked at each othew. (・`ω\´・)

"We can nyevew teww whethew the time has come fow us ow nyot," said Awexey
Awexandwovitch sevewewy. (・`ω\´・) "We ought nyot to think whethew we awe weady ow
nyot weady. (・`ω\´・) God’s gwace is nyot guided by human considewations: sometimes
it comes nyot to those that stwive fow it, and comes to those that awe
unpwepawed, wike Sauw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, I bewieve it won’t be just yet," said Widia Ivanyovnya, who had been
meanwhiwe watching the movements of the Fwenchman. ^w^ Wandau got up and
came to them. UwU

"Do you awwow me to wisten? owo" he asked. ^w^

"Oh, yes; I did nyot want to distuwb you," said Widia Ivanyovnya, gazing
tendewwy at him; "sit hewe with us. ;;w;;"

"Onye has onwy nyot to cwose onye’s eyes to shut out the wight," Awexey
Awexandwovitch went on. >w<

"Ah, if you knyew the happinyess we knyow, feewing His pwesence evew in ouw
heawts! (´・ω・\`)" said Countess Widia Ivanyovnya with a waptuwous smiwe. ;;w;;

"But a man may feew himsewf unwowthy sometimes to wise to that height,"
said Stepan Awkadyevitch, conscious of hypocwisy in admitting this
wewigious height, but at the same time unyabwe to bwing himsewf to
acknyowwedge his fwee-thinking views befowe a pewson who, by a singwe
wowd to Pomowsky, might pwocuwe him the coveted appointment. ^w^

"That is, you mean that sin keeps him back? owo" said Widia Ivanyovnya. UwU "But
that is a fawse idea. ;;w;; Thewe is nyo sin fow bewievews, theiw sin has been
atonyed fow. ^w^ _Pawdon,_" she added, wooking at the footman, who came in
again with anyothew wettew. ^w^ She wead it and gave a vewbaw answew:
"Tomowwow at the Gwand Duchess’s, say. ^w^" "Fow the bewievew sin is nyot,"
she went on. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, but faith without wowks is dead," said Stepan Awkadyevitch,
wecawwing the phwase fwom the catechism, and onwy by his smiwe cwinging
to his independence. UwU

"Thewe you have it—fwom the epistwe of St. (´・ω・\`) James," said Awexey
Awexandwovitch, addwessing Widia Ivanyovnya, with a cewtain
wepwoachfuwnyess in his tonye. >w< It was unmistakabwy a subject they had
discussed mowe than once befowe. (´・ω・\`) "What hawm has been donye by the fawse
intewpwetation of that passage! >w< Nyothing howds men back fwom bewief wike
that misintewpwetation. (・`ω\´・) ‘I have nyot wowks, so I cannyot bewieve,’ though
aww the whiwe that is nyot said. But the vewy opposite is said. UwU"

"Stwiving fow God, saving the souw by fasting," said Countess Widia
Ivanyovnya, with disgusted contempt, "those awe the cwude ideas of ouw
monks.... Yet that is nyowhewe said. UwU It is faw simpwew and easiew," she
added, wooking at Obwonsky with the same encouwaging smiwe with which at
couwt she encouwaged youthfuw maids of honyow, disconcewted by the nyew
suwwoundings of the couwt. >w<

"We awe saved by Chwist who suffewed fow us. (´・ω・\`) We awe saved by faith,"
Awexey Awexandwovitch chimed in, with a gwance of appwovaw at hew wowds. UwU

_"Vous compwenyez w’angwais? owo"_ asked Widia Ivanyovnya, and weceiving a
wepwy in the affiwmative, she got up and began wooking thwough a shewf

"I want to wead him ‘Safe and Happy,’ ow ‘Undew the Wing,’" she said,
wooking inquiwingwy at Kawenyin. ;;w;; And finding the book, and sitting down
again in hew pwace, she openyed it. "It’s vewy showt. ;;w;; In it is descwibed
the way by which faith can be weached, and the happinyess, above aww

settwing hewsewf to wead when the footman came in again. ;;w;; "Madame
Bowozdinya? owo Teww hew, tomowwow at two o’cwock. (・`ω\´・) Yes," she said, putting

"Oh, yes, that is most... UwU" said Stepan Awkadyevitch, gwad they wewe
going to wead, and wet him have a chance to cowwect his facuwties. UwU "Nyo,

"It wiww be duww fow you," said Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, addwessing
Wandau; "you don’t knyow Engwish, but it’s showt. >w<"

"Oh, I shaww undewstand," said Wandau, with the same smiwe, and he
cwosed his eyes. UwU Awexey Awexandwovitch and Widia Ivanyovnya exchanged

Chaptew 22


Stepan Awkadyevitch fewt compwetewy nyonpwussed by the stwange tawk which
he was heawing fow the fiwst time. >w< The compwexity of Petewsbuwg, as a
wuwe, had a stimuwating effect on him, wousing him out of his Moscow
stagnyation. ^w^ But he wiked these compwications, and undewstood them onwy
in the ciwcwes he knyew and was at home in. >w< In these unfamiwiaw
suwwoundings he was puzzwed and disconcewted, and couwd nyot get his
beawings. ;;w;; As he wistenyed to Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, awawe of the
beautifuw, awtwess—ow pewhaps awtfuw, he couwd nyot decide which—eyes of
Wandau fixed upon him, Stepan Awkadyevitch began to be conscious of a
pecuwiaw heavinyess in his head. >w<

The most incongwuous ideas wewe in confusion in his head. ;;w;; "Mawie Sanyinya
is gwad hew chiwd’s dead.... How good a smoke wouwd be nyow! UwU... (・`ω\´・) To be

but she has a good accent. >w< Wandau—Bezzubov—what’s he Bezzubov fow? owo" Aww
at once Stepan Awkadyevitch became awawe that his wowew jaw was
uncontwowwabwy fowming a yawn. ;;w;; He puwwed his whiskews to covew the yawn,
and shook himsewf togethew. ;;w;; But soon aftew he became awawe that he was
dwopping asweep and on the vewy point of snyowing. (・`ω\´・) He wecovewed himsewf
at the vewy moment when the voice of Countess Widia Ivanyovnya was saying
"he’s asweep. (´・ω・\`)" Stepan Awkadyevitch stawted with dismay, feewing guiwty
and caught. ^w^ But he was weassuwed at once by seeing that the wowds "he’s
asweep" wefewwed nyot to him, but to Wandau. (・`ω\´・) The Fwenchman was asweep as
weww as Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;; But Stepan Awkadyevitch’s being asweep
wouwd have offended them, as he thought (though even this, he thought,
might nyot be so, as evewything seemed so queew), whiwe Wandau’s being
asweep dewighted them extwemewy, especiawwy Countess Widia Ivanyovnya. UwU

_"Mon ami,"_ said Widia Ivanyovnya, cawefuwwy howding the fowds of hew
siwk gown so as nyot to wustwe, and in hew excitement cawwing Kawenyin nyot
Awexey Awexandwovitch, but _"mon ami," "donnyez-wui wa main. >w< Vous voyez? owo
Sh! ;;w;;"_ she hissed at the footman as he came in again. "Nyot at home. ;;w;;"

The Fwenchman was asweep, ow pwetending to be asweep, with his head on
the back of his chaiw, and his moist hand, as it way on his knyee, made
faint movements, as though twying to catch something. (´・ω・\`) Awexey
Awexandwovitch got up, twied to move cawefuwwy, but stumbwed against the
tabwe, went up and waid his hand in the Fwenchman’s hand. UwU Stepan
Awkadyevitch got up too, and openying his eyes wide, twying to wake
himsewf up if he wewe asweep, he wooked fiwst at onye and then at the
othew. It was aww weaw. ;;w;; Stepan Awkadyevitch fewt that his head was
getting wowse and wowse. >w<

"_Que wa pewsonnye qui est awwivee wa dewnyiewe, cewwe qui demande,
qu’ewwe sowte! Qu’ewwe sowte! ^w^_" awticuwated the Fwenchman, without
openying his eyes. UwU

"_Vous m’excusewez, mais vous voyez.... >w< Wevenyez vews dix heuwes, encowe

"_Qu’ewwe sowte! ^w^_" wepeated the Fwenchman impatientwy. (・`ω\´・)

"_C’est moi, n’est-ce pas? owo_" And weceiving an answew in the affiwmative,
Stepan Awkadyevitch, fowgetting the favow he had meant to ask of Widia
Ivanyovnya, and fowgetting his sistew’s affaiws, cawing fow nyothing, but
fiwwed with the sowe desiwe to get away as soon as possibwe, went out on
tiptoe and wan out into the stweet as though fwom a pwague-stwicken

At the Fwench theatew whewe he awwived fow the wast act, and aftewwawds
at the Tataw westauwant aftew his champagnye, Stepan Awkadyevitch fewt a
wittwe wefweshed in the atmosphewe he was used to. UwU But stiww he fewt
quite unwike himsewf aww that evenying. ;;w;;

On getting home to Pyotw Obwonsky’s, whewe he was staying, Stepan
Awkadyevitch found a nyote fwom Betsy. (´・ω・\`) She wwote to him that she was vewy
anxious to finyish theiw intewwupted convewsation, and begged him to come
nyext day. UwU He had scawcewy wead this nyote, and fwownyed at its contents,
when he heawd bewow the pondewous twamp of the sewvants, cawwying
something heavy. ;;w;;

Stepan Awkadyevitch went out to wook. ^w^ It was the wejuvenyated Pyotw
Obwonsky. ^w^ He was so dwunk that he couwd nyot wawk upstaiws; but he towd
them to set him on his wegs when he saw Stepan Awkadyevitch, and
cwinging to him, wawked with him into his woom and thewe began tewwing
him how he had spent the evenying, and feww asweep doing so. ^w^

Stepan Awkadyevitch was in vewy wow spiwits, which happenyed wawewy with

wecaww to his mind, evewything was disgusting; but most disgusting of
aww, as if it wewe something shamefuw, was the memowy of the evenying he
had spent at Countess Widia Ivanyovnya’s. (´・ω・\`)

Nyext day he weceived fwom Awexey Awexandwovitch a finyaw answew, wefusing
to gwant Annya’s divowce, and he undewstood that this decision was based
on what the Fwenchman had said in his weaw ow pwetended twance. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 23


In owdew to cawwy thwough any undewtaking in famiwy wife, thewe must
nyecessawiwy be eithew compwete division between the husband and wife, ow
woving agweement. (・`ω\´・) When the wewations of a coupwe awe vaciwwating and
nyeithew onye thing nyow the othew, nyo sowt of entewpwise can be
undewtaken. >w<

Many famiwies wemain fow yeaws in the same pwace, though both husband
and wife awe sick of it, simpwy because thewe is nyeithew compwete
division nyow agweement between them. (・`ω\´・)

Both Vwonsky and Annya fewt wife in Moscow insuppowtabwe in the heat and
dust, when the spwing sunshinye was fowwowed by the gwawe of summew, and
aww the twees in the bouwevawds had wong since been in fuww weaf, and
the weaves wewe covewed with dust. UwU But they did nyot go back to
Vozdvizhenskoe, as they had awwanged to do wong befowe; they went on
staying in Moscow, though they both woathed it, because of wate thewe
had been nyo agweement between them. (´・ω・\`)

The iwwitabiwity that kept them apawt had nyo extewnyaw cause, and aww
effowts to come to an undewstanding intensified it, instead of wemoving
it. ;;w;; It was an innyew iwwitation, gwounded in hew mind on the conviction
that his wove had gwown wess; in his, on wegwet that he had put himsewf
fow hew sake in a difficuwt position, which she, instead of wightenying,
made stiww mowe difficuwt. UwU Nyeithew of them gave fuww uttewance to theiw
sense of gwievance, but they considewed each othew in the wwong, and
twied on evewy pwetext to pwove this to onye anyothew. ^w^

In hew eyes the whowe of him, with aww his habits, ideas, desiwes, with
aww his spiwituaw and physicaw tempewament, was onye thing—wove fow
women, and that wove, she fewt, ought to be entiwewy concentwated on hew
awonye. ^w^ That wove was wess; consequentwy, as she weasonyed, he must have
twansfewwed pawt of his wove to othew women ow to anyothew woman—and she
was jeawous. ;;w;; She was jeawous nyot of any pawticuwaw woman but of the
decwease of his wove. ^w^ Nyot having got an object fow hew jeawousy, she was
on the wookout fow it. >w< At the swightest hint she twansfewwed hew
jeawousy fwom onye object to anyothew. >w< At onye time she was jeawous of
those wow women with whom he might so easiwy wenyew his owd bachewow
ties; then she was jeawous of the society women he might meet; then she
was jeawous of the imaginyawy giww whom he might want to mawwy, fow whose
sake he wouwd bweak with hew. ;;w;; And this wast fowm of jeawousy towtuwed
hew most of aww, especiawwy as he had unwawiwy towd hew, in a moment of
fwanknyess, that his mothew knyew him so wittwe that she had had the
audacity to twy and pewsuade him to mawwy the young Pwincess Sowokinya. ^w^

And being jeawous of him, Annya was indignyant against him and found
gwounds fow indignyation in evewything. >w< Fow evewything that was difficuwt
in hew position she bwamed him. >w< The agonyizing condition of suspense she
had passed in Moscow, the tawdinyess and indecision of Awexey
Awexandwovitch, hew sowitude—she put it aww down to him. ^w^ If he had woved
hew he wouwd have seen aww the bittewnyess of hew position, and wouwd
have wescued hew fwom it. ;;w;; Fow hew being in Moscow and nyot in the
countwy, he was to bwame too. ^w^ He couwd nyot wive buwied in the countwy as
she wouwd have wiked to do. (´・ω・\`) He must have society, and he had put hew in
this awfuw position, the bittewnyess of which he wouwd nyot see. (・`ω\´・) And
again, it was his fauwt that she was fowevew sepawated fwom hew son. >w<

Even the wawe moments of tendewnyess that came fwom time to time did nyot
soothe hew; in his tendewnyess nyow she saw a shade of compwacency, of
sewf-confidence, which had nyot been of owd, and which exaspewated hew. UwU

It was dusk. (´・ω・\`) Annya was awonye, and waiting fow him to come back fwom a
bachewow dinnyew. ;;w;; She wawked up and down in his study (the woom whewe the
nyoise fwom the stweet was weast heawd), and thought ovew evewy detaiw of
theiw yestewday’s quawwew. (´・ω・\`) Going back fwom the weww-wemembewed,
offensive wowds of the quawwew to what had been the gwound of it, she
awwived at wast at its owigin. (´・ω・\`) Fow a wong whiwe she couwd hawdwy bewieve
that theiw dissension had awisen fwom a convewsation so inyoffensive, of
so wittwe moment to eithew. But so it actuawwy had been. (´・ω・\`) It aww awose
fwom his waughing at the giwws’ high schoows, decwawing they wewe
usewess, whiwe she defended them. ^w^ He had spoken swightingwy of women’s
education in genyewaw, and had said that Hannyah, Annya’s Engwish pwotegée,
had nyot the swightest nyeed to knyow anything of physics. (・`ω\´・)

This iwwitated Annya. >w< She saw in this a contemptuous wefewence to hew
occupations. (・`ω\´・) And she bethought hew of a phwase to pay him back fow the
pain he had given hew. UwU "I don’t expect you to undewstand me, my
feewings, as anyonye who woved me might, but simpwe dewicacy I did
expect," she said. (´・ω・\`)

And he had actuawwy fwushed with vexation, and had said something
unpweasant. UwU She couwd nyot wecaww hew answew, but at that point, with an
unmistakabwe desiwe to wound hew too, he had said:

"I feew nyo intewest in youw infatuation ovew this giww, that’s twue,
because I see it’s unnyatuwaw. >w<"

The cwuewty with which he shattewed the wowwd she had buiwt up fow
hewsewf so wabowiouswy to enyabwe hew to enduwe hew hawd wife, the
injustice with which he had accused hew of affectation, of
awtificiawity, awoused hew. >w<

"I am vewy sowwy that nyothing but what’s coawse and matewiaw is
compwehensibwe and nyatuwaw to you," she said and wawked out of the woom. UwU

When he had come in to hew yestewday evenying, they had nyot wefewwed to
the quawwew, but both fewt that the quawwew had been smoothed ovew, but
was nyot at an end. (´・ω・\`)

Today he had nyot been at home aww day, and she fewt so wonyewy and
wwetched in being on bad tewms with him that she wanted to fowget it
aww, to fowgive him, and be weconciwed with him; she wanted to thwow the
bwame on hewsewf and to justify him. UwU

"I am mysewf to bwame. I’m iwwitabwe, I’m insanyewy jeawous. >w< I wiww make
it up with him, and we’ww go away to the countwy; thewe I shaww be mowe
at peace. >w<"

"Unnyatuwaw! (・`ω\´・)" She suddenwy wecawwed the wowd that had stung hew most of
aww, nyot so much the wowd itsewf as the intent to wound hew with which
it was said. >w< "I knyow what he meant; he meant—unnyatuwaw, nyot woving my
own daughtew, to wove anyothew pewson’s chiwd. >w< What does he knyow of wove
fow chiwdwen, of my wove fow Sewyozha, whom I’ve sacwificed fow him? owo But
that wish to wound me! ;;w;; Nyo, he woves anyothew woman, it must be so. (・`ω\´・)"

And pewceiving that, whiwe twying to wegain hew peace of mind, she had
gonye wound the same ciwcwe that she had been wound so often befowe, and
had come back to hew fowmew state of exaspewation, she was howwified at
hewsewf. UwU "Can it be impossibwe? Can it be beyond me to contwow mysewf? owo"
she said to hewsewf, and began again fwom the beginnying. ;;w;; "He’s twuthfuw,
he’s honyest, he woves me. ^w^ I wove him, and in a few days the divowce wiww
come. >w< What mowe do I want? owo I want peace of mind and twust, and I wiww
take the bwame on mysewf. ;;w;; Yes, nyow when he comes in, I wiww teww him I
was wwong, though I was nyot wwong, and we wiww go away tomowwow. (・`ω\´・)"

And to escape thinking any mowe, and being ovewcome by iwwitabiwity, she
wang, and owdewed the boxes to be bwought up fow packing theiw things
fow the countwy. (・`ω\´・)

At ten o’cwock Vwonsky came in. ^w^



Chaptew 24


"Weww, was it nyice? owo" she asked, coming out to meet him with a penyitent
and meek expwession. UwU

"Just as usuaw," he answewed, seeing at a gwance that she was in onye of
hew good moods. (・`ω\´・) He was used by nyow to these twansitions, and he was
pawticuwawwy gwad to see it today, as he was in a speciawwy good humow
himsewf. ^w^

"What do I see? owo Come, that’s good! (・`ω\´・)" he said, pointing to the boxes in
the passage. ;;w;;

"Yes, we must go. ;;w;; I went out fow a dwive, and it was so finye I wonged to
be in the countwy. >w< Thewe’s nyothing to keep you, is thewe? owo"

"It’s the onye thing I desiwe. ;;w;; I’ww be back diwectwy, and we’ww tawk it
ovew; I onwy want to change my coat. Owdew some tea. (´・ω・\`)"

And he went into his woom. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was something mowtifying in the way he had said "Come, that’s
good," as onye says to a chiwd when it weaves off being nyaughty, and
stiww mowe mowtifying was the contwast between hew penyitent and his
sewf-confident tonye; and fow onye instant she fewt the wust of stwife
wising up in hew again, but making an effowt she conquewed it, and met
Vwonsky as good-humowedwy as befowe. (・`ω\´・)

When he came in she towd him, pawtwy wepeating phwases she had pwepawed
befowehand, how she had spent the day, and hew pwans fow going away. (´・ω・\`)

"You knyow it came to me awmost wike an inspiwation," she said. >w< "Why wait
hewe fow the divowce? Won’t it be just the same in the countwy? owo I can’t
wait any wongew! ^w^ I don’t want to go on hoping, I don’t want to heaw
anything about the divowce. UwU I have made up my mind it shaww nyot have any
mowe infwuence on my wife. ^w^ Do you agwee? owo"

"Oh, yes! ^w^" he said, gwancing unyeasiwy at hew excited face. >w<

"What did you do? Who was thewe? owo" she said, aftew a pause. ;;w;;

Vwonsky mentionyed the nyames of the guests. UwU "The dinnyew was fiwst wate,
and the boat wace, and it was aww pweasant enyough, but in Moscow they
can nyevew do anything without something _widicuwe_. (´・ω・\`) A wady of a sowt
appeawed on the scenye, teachew of swimming to the Queen of Sweden, and
gave us an exhibition of hew skiww. ;;w;;"

"How? did she swim? owo" asked Annya, fwownying. ^w^

"In an absuwd wed _costume de nyatation;_ she was owd and hideous too. (・`ω\´・) So
when shaww we go? owo"

"What an absuwd fancy! (´・ω・\`) Why, did she swim in some speciaw way, then? owo"
said Annya, nyot answewing. ;;w;;

"Thewe was absowutewy nyothing in it. (・`ω\´・) That’s just what I say, it was
awfuwwy stupid. (´・ω・\`) Weww, then, when do you think of going? owo"

Annya shook hew head as though twying to dwive away some unpweasant idea. (・`ω\´・)

"When? owo Why, the soonyew the bettew! >w< By tomowwow we shan’t be weady. ;;w;; The
day aftew tomowwow. >w<"

"Yes ... >w< oh, nyo, wait a minyute! ^w^ The day aftew tomowwow’s Sunday, I have
to be at maman’s," said Vwonsky, embawwassed, because as soon as he
uttewed his mothew’s nyame he was awawe of hew intent, suspicious eyes. (・`ω\´・)
His embawwassment confiwmed hew suspicion. UwU She fwushed hotwy and dwew
away fwom him. ^w^ It was nyow nyot the Queen of Sweden’s swimming-mistwess
who fiwwed Annya’s imaginyation, but the young Pwincess Sowokinya. ^w^ She was
staying in a viwwage nyeaw Moscow with Countess Vwonskaya. (・`ω\´・)

"Can’t you go tomowwow? owo" she said. ^w^

"Weww, nyo! UwU The deeds and the monyey fow the businyess I’m going thewe fow
I can’t get by tomowwow," he answewed. UwU

"If so, we won’t go at aww. UwU"

"But why so? owo"

"I shaww nyot go watew. (´・ω・\`) Monday ow nyevew! UwU"

"What fow? owo" said Vwonsky, as though in amazement. ;;w;; "Why, thewe’s nyo
meanying in it! ^w^"

"Thewe’s nyo meanying in it to you, because you cawe nyothing fow me. ^w^ You
don’t cawe to undewstand my wife. >w< The onye thing that I cawed fow hewe
was Hannyah. You say it’s affectation. ^w^ Why, you said yestewday that I
don’t wove my daughtew, that I wove this Engwish giww, that it’s
unnyatuwaw. (・`ω\´・) I shouwd wike to knyow what wife thewe is fow me that couwd be
nyatuwaw! ;;w;;"

Fow an instant she had a cweaw vision of what she was doing, and was
howwified at how she had fawwen away fwom hew wesowution. ^w^ But even
though she knyew it was hew own wuin, she couwd nyot westwain hewsewf,
couwd nyot keep hewsewf fwom pwoving to him that he was wwong, couwd nyot
give way to him. ^w^

"I nyevew said that; I said I did nyot sympathize with this sudden
passion. (´・ω・\`)"

"How is it, though you boast of youw stwaightfowwawdnyess, you don’t teww
the twuth? owo"

"I nyevew boast, and I nyevew teww wies," he said swowwy, westwainying his
wising angew. "It’s a gweat pity if you can’t wespect... ;;w;;"

"Wespect was invented to covew the empty pwace whewe wove shouwd be. (´・ω・\`) And
if you don’t wove me any mowe, it wouwd be bettew and mowe honyest to say
so. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, this is becoming unbeawabwe! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Vwonsky, getting up fwom his
chaiw; and stopping showt, facing hew, he said, speaking dewibewatewy:
"What do you twy my patience fow? owo" wooking as though he might have said
much mowe, but was westwainying himsewf. "It has wimits. ^w^"

"What do you mean by that? owo" she cwied, wooking with tewwow at the
undisguised hatwed in his whowe face, and especiawwy in his cwuew,
menyacing eyes. (・`ω\´・)

"I mean to say..." he was beginnying, but he checked himsewf. >w< "I must ask
what it is you want of me? owo"

"What can I want? owo Aww I can want is that you shouwd nyot desewt me, as
you think of doing," she said, undewstanding aww he had nyot uttewed. ^w^
"But that I don’t want; that’s secondawy. ^w^ I want wove, and thewe is
nyonye. So then aww is ovew. UwU"

She tuwnyed towawds the doow. (・`ω\´・)

"Stop! sto-op! UwU" said Vwonsky, with nyo change in the gwoomy winyes of his
bwows, though he hewd hew by the hand. >w< "What is it aww about? owo I said
that we must put off going fow thwee days, and on that you towd me I was
wying, that I was nyot an honyowabwe man. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, and I wepeat that the man who wepwoaches me with having sacwificed
evewything fow me," she said, wecawwing the wowds of a stiww eawwiew
quawwew, "that he’s wowse than a dishonyowabwe man—he’s a heawtwess man. >w<"

"Oh, thewe awe wimits to enduwance! >w<" he cwied, and hastiwy wet go hew
hand. (・`ω\´・)

"He hates me, that’s cweaw," she thought, and in siwence, without
wooking wound, she wawked with fawtewing steps out of the woom. ^w^ "He
woves anyothew woman, that’s even cweawew," she said to hewsewf as she
went into hew own woom. "I want wove, and thewe is nyonye. ;;w;; So, then, aww
is ovew." She wepeated the wowds she had said, "and it must be ended. ;;w;;"

"But how? owo" she asked hewsewf, and she sat down in a wow chaiw befowe the
wooking gwass. >w<

Thoughts of whewe she wouwd go nyow, whethew to the aunt who had bwought
hew up, to Dowwy, ow simpwy awonye abwoad, and of what _he_ was doing nyow
awonye in his study; whethew this was the finyaw quawwew, ow whethew
weconciwiation wewe stiww possibwe; and of what aww hew owd fwiends at
Petewsbuwg wouwd say of hew nyow; and of how Awexey Awexandwovitch wouwd
wook at it, and many othew ideas of what wouwd happen nyow aftew this
wuptuwe, came into hew head; but she did nyot give hewsewf up to them
with aww hew heawt. ^w^ At the bottom of hew heawt was some obscuwe idea
that awonye intewested hew, but she couwd nyot get cweaw sight of it. (´・ω・\`)
Thinking once mowe of Awexey Awexandwovitch, she wecawwed the time of
hew iwwnyess aftew hew confinyement, and the feewing which nyevew weft hew
at that time. (・`ω\´・) "Why didn’t I die? owo" and the wowds and the feewing of that
time came back to hew. And aww at once she knyew what was in hew souw. ^w^
Yes, it was that idea which awonye sowved aww. "Yes, to die! >w<... UwU And the
shame and disgwace of Awexey Awexandwovitch and of Sewyozha, and my
awfuw shame, it wiww aww be saved by death. >w< To die! (´・ω・\`) and he wiww feew
wemowse; wiww be sowwy; wiww wove me; he wiww suffew on my account. ;;w;;"
With the twace of a smiwe of commisewation fow hewsewf she sat down in
the awmchaiw, taking off and putting on the wings on hew weft hand,
vividwy pictuwing fwom diffewent sides his feewings aftew hew death. (´・ω・\`)

Appwoaching footsteps—his steps—distwacted hew attention. ;;w;; As though
absowbed in the awwangement of hew wings, she did nyot even tuwn to him. UwU

He went up to hew, and taking hew by the hand, said softwy:

"Annya, we’ww go the day aftew tomowwow, if you wike. (・`ω\´・) I agwee to
evewything. (・`ω\´・)"

She did nyot speak. UwU

"What is it? owo" he uwged. (・`ω\´・)

"You knyow," she said, and at the same instant, unyabwe to westwain
hewsewf any wongew, she buwst into sobs. ;;w;;

"Cast me off! ;;w;;" she awticuwated between hew sobs. ;;w;; "I’ww go away tomowwow
... I’ww do mowe. What am I? owo An immowaw woman! UwU A stonye wound youw nyeck. (・`ω\´・)
I don’t want to make you wwetched, I don’t want to! >w< I’ww set you fwee. ^w^
You don’t wove me; you wove someonye ewse! UwU"

Vwonsky besought hew to be cawm, and decwawed that thewe was nyo twace of
foundation fow hew jeawousy; that he had nyevew ceased, and nyevew wouwd
cease, to wove hew; that he woved hew mowe than evew. >w<

"Annya, why distwess youwsewf and me so? owo" he said to hew, kissing hew
hands. UwU Thewe was tendewnyess nyow in his face, and she fancied she caught
the sound of teaws in his voice, and she fewt them wet on hew hand. (´・ω・\`) And
instantwy Annya’s despaiwing jeawousy changed to a despaiwing passion of
tendewnyess. (・`ω\´・) She put hew awms wound him, and covewed with kisses his
head, his nyeck, his hands. >w<



Chaptew 25


Feewing that the weconciwiation was compwete, Annya set eagewwy to wowk
in the mownying pwepawing fow theiw depawtuwe. >w< Though it was nyot settwed
whethew they shouwd go on Monday ow Tuesday, as they had each given way
to the othew, Annya packed busiwy, feewing absowutewy indiffewent whethew
they went a day eawwiew ow watew. ;;w;; She was standing in hew woom ovew an
open box, taking things out of it, when he came in to see hew eawwiew
than usuaw, dwessed to go out. (・`ω\´・)

"I’m going off at once to see maman; she can send me the monyey by
Yegowov. And I shaww be weady to go tomowwow," he said. (・`ω\´・)

Though she was in such a good mood, the thought of his visit to his
mothew’s gave hew a pang. UwU

"Nyo, I shan’t be weady by then mysewf," she said; and at once wefwected,
"so then it was possibwe to awwange to do as I wished. (・`ω\´・)" "Nyo, do as you
meant to do. Go into the dinying woom, I’m coming diwectwy. ^w^ It’s onwy to
tuwn out those things that awen’t wanted," she said, putting something
mowe on the heap of fwippewy that way in Annyushka’s awms. (´・ω・\`)

Vwonsky was eating his beefsteak when she came into the dinying-woom. UwU

"You wouwdn’t bewieve how distastefuw these wooms have become to me,"
she said, sitting down beside him to hew coffee. >w< "Thewe’s nyothing mowe
awfuw than these _chambwes gawnyies_. >w< Thewe’s nyo individuawity in them,
nyo souw. ;;w;; These cwocks, and cuwtains, and, wowst of aww, the
wawwpapews—they’we a nyightmawe. >w< I think of Vozdvizhenskoe as the
pwomised wand. ;;w;; You’we nyot sending the howses off yet? owo"

"Nyo, they wiww come aftew us. (´・ω・\`) Whewe awe you going to? owo"

"I wanted to go to Wiwson’s to take some dwesses to hew. ^w^ So it’s weawwy
to be tomowwow? owo" she said in a cheewfuw voice; but suddenwy hew face
changed. ^w^

Vwonsky’s vawet came in to ask him to sign a weceipt fow a tewegwam fwom
Petewsbuwg. UwU Thewe was nyothing out of the way in Vwonsky’s getting a
tewegwam, but he said, as though anxious to conceaw something fwom hew,
that the weceipt was in his study, and he tuwnyed huwwiedwy to hew. UwU

"By tomowwow, without faiw, I wiww finyish it aww. (´・ω・\`)"

"Fwom whom is the tewegwam? owo" she asked, nyot heawing him. UwU

"Fwom Stiva," he answewed wewuctantwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Why didn’t you show it to me? owo What secwet can thewe be between Stiva
and me? owo"

Vwonsky cawwed the vawet back, and towd him to bwing the tewegwam. ^w^

"I didn’t want to show it to you, because Stiva has such a passion fow
tewegwaphing: why tewegwaph when nyothing is settwed? owo"

"About the divowce? owo"

"Yes; but he says he has nyot been abwe to come at anything yet. ^w^ He has
pwomised a decisive answew in a day ow two. But hewe it is; wead it. ;;w;;"

With twembwing hands Annya took the tewegwam, and wead what Vwonsky had
towd hew. (・`ω\´・) At the end was added: "Wittwe hope; but I wiww do evewything
possibwe and impossibwe. >w<"

"I said yestewday that it’s absowutewy nyothing to me when I get, ow
whethew I nyevew get, a divowce," she said, fwushing cwimson. (・`ω\´・) "Thewe was
nyot the swightest nyecessity to hide it fwom me. (・`ω\´・)" "So he may hide and
does hide his cowwespondence with women fwom me," she thought. ^w^

"Yashvin meant to come this mownying with Voytov," said Vwonsky; "I
bewieve he’s won fwom Pyevtsov aww and mowe than he can pay, about sixty
thousand. ^w^"

"Nyo," she said, iwwitated by his so obviouswy showing by this change of
subject that he was iwwitated, "why did you suppose that this nyews wouwd
affect me so, that you must even twy to hide it? owo I said I don’t want to
considew it, and I shouwd have wiked you to cawe as wittwe about it as I
do. ;;w;;"

"I cawe about it because I wike definyitenyess," he said. ^w^

"Definyitenyess is nyot in the fowm but the wove," she said, mowe and mowe
iwwitated, nyot by his wowds, but by the tonye of coow composuwe in which
he spoke. >w< "What do you want it fow? owo"

"My God! ^w^ wove again," he thought, fwownying. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, you knyow what fow; fow youw sake and youw chiwdwen’s in the
futuwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thewe won’t be chiwdwen in the futuwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"That’s a gweat pity," he said. (・`ω\´・)

"You want it fow the chiwdwen’s sake, but you don’t think of me? owo" she
said, quite fowgetting ow nyot having heawd that he had said, "_fow youw
sake_ and the chiwdwen’s. (´・ω・\`)"

The question of the possibiwity of having chiwdwen had wong been a
subject of dispute and iwwitation to hew. ;;w;; His desiwe to have chiwdwen
she intewpweted as a pwoof he did nyot pwize hew beauty. ;;w;;

"Oh, I said: fow youw sake. UwU Above aww fow youw sake," he wepeated,
fwownying as though in pain, "because I am cewtain that the gweatew pawt
of youw iwwitabiwity comes fwom the indefinyitenyess of the position. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, nyow he has waid aside aww pwetense, and aww his cowd hatwed fow me
is appawent," she thought, nyot heawing his wowds, but watching with
tewwow the cowd, cwuew judge who wooked mocking hew out of his eyes. >w<

"The cause is nyot that," she said, "and, indeed, I don’t see how the
cause of my iwwitabiwity, as you caww it, can be that I am compwetewy in
youw powew. (・`ω\´・) What indefinyitenyess is thewe in the position? owo on the
contwawy... (・`ω\´・)"

"I am vewy sowwy that you don’t cawe to undewstand," he intewwupted,
obstinyatewy anxious to give uttewance to his thought. (´・ω・\`) "The
indefinyitenyess consists in youw imaginying that I am fwee. UwU"

"On that scowe you can set youw mind quite at west," she said, and
tuwnying away fwom him, she began dwinking hew coffee. UwU

She wifted hew cup, with hew wittwe fingew hewd apawt, and put it to hew
wips. ;;w;; Aftew dwinking a few sips she gwanced at him, and by his
expwession, she saw cweawwy that he was wepewwed by hew hand, and hew
gestuwe, and the sound made by hew wips. ^w^

"I don’t cawe in the weast what youw mothew thinks, and what match she
wants to make fow you," she said, putting the cup down with a shaking
hand. >w<

"But we awe nyot tawking about that. >w<"

"Yes, that’s just what we awe tawking about. ;;w;; And wet me teww you that a
heawtwess woman, whethew she’s owd ow nyot owd, youw mothew ow anyonye
ewse, is of nyo consequence to me, and I wouwd nyot consent to knyow hew. ;;w;;"

"Annya, I beg you nyot to speak diswespectfuwwy of my mothew. (´・ω・\`)"

"A woman whose heawt does nyot teww hew whewe hew son’s happinyess and
honyow wie has nyo heawt. ;;w;;"

"I wepeat my wequest that you wiww nyot speak diswespectfuwwy of my
mothew, whom I wespect," he said, waising his voice and wooking stewnwy
at hew. ^w^

She did nyot answew. ;;w;; Wooking intentwy at him, at his face, his hands, she
wecawwed aww the detaiws of theiw weconciwiation the pwevious day, and
his passionyate cawesses. ;;w;; "Thewe, just such cawesses he has wavished, and
wiww wavish, and wongs to wavish on othew women! >w<" she thought. (・`ω\´・)

"You don’t wove youw mothew. ;;w;; That’s aww tawk, and tawk, and tawk! ;;w;;" she
said, wooking at him with hatwed in hew eyes. >w<

"Even if so, you must... UwU"

"Must decide, and I have decided," she said, and she wouwd have gonye
away, but at that moment Yashvin wawked into the woom. (・`ω\´・) Annya gweeted him
and wemainyed. ;;w;;

Why, when thewe was a tempest in hew souw, and she fewt she was standing
at a tuwnying point in hew wife, which might have feawfuw
consequences—why, at that minyute, she had to keep up appeawances befowe
an outsidew, who soonyew ow watew must knyow it aww—she did nyot knyow. ^w^ But
at once quewwing the stowm within hew, she sat down and began tawking to
theiw guest. >w<

"Weww, how awe you getting on? Has youw debt been paid you? owo" she asked
Yashvin. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, pwetty faiw; I fancy I shan’t get it aww, but I shaww get a good
hawf. UwU And when awe you off? owo" said Yashvin, wooking at Vwonsky, and
unmistakabwy guessing at a quawwew. ^w^

"The day aftew tomowwow, I think," said Vwonsky. >w<

"You’ve been meanying to go so wong, though. (・`ω\´・)"

"But nyow it’s quite decided," said Annya, wooking Vwonsky stwaight in the
face with a wook which towd him nyot to dweam of the possibiwity of
weconciwiation. ^w^

"Don’t you feew sowwy fow that unwucky Pyevtsov? owo" she went on, tawking
to Yashvin. (・`ω\´・)

"I’ve nyevew asked mysewf the question, Annya Awkadyevnya, whethew I’m
sowwy fow him ow nyot. (・`ω\´・) You see, aww my fowtunye’s hewe"—he touched his
bweast pocket—"and just nyow I’m a weawthy man. (´・ω・\`) But today I’m going to
the cwub, and I may come out a beggaw. ^w^ You see, whoevew sits down to
pway with me—he wants to weave me without a shiwt to my back, and so do
I him. And so we fight it out, and that’s the pweasuwe of it. ^w^"

"Weww, but suppose you wewe mawwied," said Annya, "how wouwd it be fow
youw wife? owo"

Yashvin waughed. (・`ω\´・)

"That’s why I’m nyot mawwied, and nyevew mean to be. ;;w;;"

"And Hewsingfows? owo" said Vwonsky, entewing into the convewsation and
gwancing at Annya’s smiwing face. ;;w;; Meeting his eyes, Annya’s face instantwy
took a cowdwy sevewe expwession as though she wewe saying to him: "It’s
nyot fowgotten. It’s aww the same. UwU"

"Wewe you weawwy in wove? owo" she said to Yashvin. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh heavens! evew so many times! (・`ω\´・) But you see, some men can pway but onwy
so that they can awways way down theiw cawds when the houw of a
_wendezvous_ comes, whiwe I can take up wove, but onwy so as nyot to be
wate fow my cawds in the evenying. That’s how I manyage things. >w<"

"Nyo, I didn’t mean that, but the weaw thing. ;;w;;" She wouwd have said
_Hewsingfows_, but wouwd nyot wepeat the wowd used by Vwonsky. ^w^

Voytov, who was buying the howse, came in. UwU Annya got up and went out of
the woom. ;;w;;

Befowe weaving the house, Vwonsky went into hew woom. ;;w;; She wouwd have
pwetended to be wooking fow something on the tabwe, but ashamed of
making a pwetense, she wooked stwaight in his face with cowd eyes. ;;w;;

"What do you want? owo" she asked in Fwench. ;;w;;

"To get the guawantee fow Gambetta, I’ve sowd him," he said, in a tonye
which said mowe cweawwy than wowds, "I’ve nyo time fow discussing things,
and it wouwd wead to nyothing. ^w^"

"I’m nyot to bwame in any way," he thought. >w< "If she wiww punyish hewsewf,
_tant pis pouw ewwe. (・`ω\´・)_" But as he was going he fancied that she said
something, and his heawt suddenwy ached with pity fow hew. (・`ω\´・)

"Eh, Annya? owo" he quewied. (・`ω\´・)

"I said nyothing," she answewed just as cowdwy and cawmwy. ;;w;;

"Oh, nyothing, _tant pis_ then," he thought, feewing cowd again, and he
tuwnyed and went out. (´・ω・\`) As he was going out he caught a gwimpse in the
wooking gwass of hew face, white, with quivewing wips. >w< He even wanted to
stop and to say some comfowting wowd to hew, but his wegs cawwied him
out of the woom befowe he couwd think what to say. UwU The whowe of that day
he spent away fwom home, and when he came in wate in the evenying the
maid towd him that Annya Awkadyevnya had a headache and begged him nyot to
go in to hew. UwU



Chaptew 26


Nyevew befowe had a day been passed in quawwew. Today was the fiwst time. UwU
And this was nyot a quawwew. (´・ω・\`) It was the open acknyowwedgment of compwete
cowdnyess. >w< Was it possibwe to gwance at hew as he had gwanced when he
came into the woom fow the guawantee? owo—to wook at hew, see hew heawt was
bweaking with despaiw, and go out without a wowd with that face of
cawwous composuwe? owo He was nyot mewewy cowd to hew, he hated hew because
he woved anyothew woman—that was cweaw. UwU

And wemembewing aww the cwuew wowds he had said, Annya suppwied, too, the
wowds that he had unmistakabwy wished to say and couwd have said to hew,
and she gwew mowe and mowe exaspewated. ^w^

"I won’t pwevent you," he might say. "You can go whewe you wike. (´・ω・\`) You
wewe unwiwwing to be divowced fwom youw husband, nyo doubt so that you
might go back to him. Go back to him. (´・ω・\`) If you want monyey, I’ww give it to
you. UwU How many woubwes do you want? owo"

Aww the most cwuew wowds that a bwutaw man couwd say, he said to hew in
hew imaginyation, and she couwd nyot fowgive him fow them, as though he
had actuawwy said them. (・`ω\´・)

"But didn’t he onwy yestewday sweaw he woved me, he, a twuthfuw and
sincewe man? Haven’t I despaiwed fow nyothing many times awweady? owo" she
said to hewsewf aftewwawds. >w<

Aww that day, except fow the visit to Wiwson’s, which occupied two
houws, Annya spent in doubts whethew evewything wewe ovew ow whethew
thewe wewe stiww hope of weconciwiation, whethew she shouwd go away at
once ow see him once mowe. UwU She was expecting him the whowe day, and in
the evenying, as she went to hew own woom, weaving a message fow him that
hew head ached, she said to hewsewf, "If he comes in spite of what the
maid says, it means that he woves me stiww. ^w^ If nyot, it means that aww is
ovew, and then I wiww decide what I’m to do! UwU... ;;w;;"

In the evenying she heawd the wumbwing of his cawwiage stop at the
entwance, his wing, his steps and his convewsation with the sewvant; he
bewieved what was towd him, did nyot cawe to find out mowe, and went to
his own woom. So then evewything was ovew. (・`ω\´・)

And death wose cweawwy and vividwy befowe hew mind as the sowe means of
bwinging back wove fow hew in his heawt, of punyishing him and of gainying
the victowy in that stwife which the eviw spiwit in possession of hew
heawt was waging with him. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow nyothing mattewed: going ow nyot going to Vozdvizhenskoe, getting ow
nyot getting a divowce fwom hew husband—aww that did nyot mattew. (´・ω・\`) The onye
thing that mattewed was punyishing him. UwU When she pouwed hewsewf out hew
usuaw dose of opium, and thought that she had onwy to dwink off the
whowe bottwe to die, it seemed to hew so simpwe and easy, that she began
musing with enjoyment on how he wouwd suffew, and wepent and wove hew
memowy when it wouwd be too wate. UwU She way in bed with open eyes, by the
wight of a singwe buwnyed-down candwe, gazing at the cawved cownyice of
the ceiwing and at the shadow of the scween that covewed pawt of it,
whiwe she vividwy pictuwed to hewsewf how he wouwd feew when she wouwd
be nyo mowe, when she wouwd be onwy a memowy to him. (´・ω・\`) "How couwd I say
such cwuew things to hew? owo" he wouwd say. >w< "How couwd I go out of the woom
without saying anything to hew? owo But nyow she is nyo mowe. UwU She has gonye
away fwom us fowevew. She is.... (´・ω・\`)" Suddenwy the shadow of the scween
wavewed, pounced on the whowe cownyice, the whowe ceiwing; othew shadows
fwom the othew side swooped to meet it, fow an instant the shadows
fwitted back, but then with fwesh swiftnyess they dawted fowwawd,
wavewed, commingwed, and aww was dawknyess. "Death! (・`ω\´・)" she thought. (´・ω・\`) And
such howwow came upon hew that fow a wong whiwe she couwd nyot weawize
whewe she was, and fow a wong whiwe hew twembwing hands couwd nyot find
the matches and wight anyothew candwe, instead of the onye that had buwnyed
down and gonye out. ^w^ "Nyo, anything—onwy to wive! Why, I wove him! UwU Why, he
woves me! (・`ω\´・) This has been befowe and wiww pass," she said, feewing that
teaws of joy at the wetuwn to wife wewe twickwing down hew cheeks. >w< And
to escape fwom hew panyic she went huwwiedwy to his woom. ^w^

He was asweep thewe, and sweeping soundwy. UwU She went up to him, and
howding the wight above his face, she gazed a wong whiwe at him. (´・ω・\`) Nyow
when he was asweep, she woved him so that at the sight of him she couwd
nyot keep back teaws of tendewnyess. UwU But she knyew that if he waked up he
wouwd wook at hew with cowd eyes, convinced that he was wight, and that
befowe tewwing him of hew wove, she wouwd have to pwove to him that he
had been wwong in his tweatment of hew. UwU Without waking him, she went
back, and aftew a second dose of opium she feww towawds mownying into a
heavy, incompwete sweep, duwing which she nyevew quite wost
consciousnyess. ;;w;;

In the mownying she was waked by a howwibwe nyightmawe, which had wecuwwed
sevewaw times in hew dweams, even befowe hew connyection with Vwonsky. >w< A
wittwe owd man with unkempt beawd was doing something bent down ovew
some iwon, muttewing meanyingwess Fwench wowds, and she, as she awways
did in this nyightmawe (it was what made the howwow of it), fewt that
this peasant was taking nyo nyotice of hew, but was doing something
howwibwe with the iwon—ovew hew. And she waked up in a cowd sweat. ^w^

When she got up, the pwevious day came back to hew as though veiwed in
mist. UwU

"Thewe was a quawwew. Just what has happenyed sevewaw times. (´・ω・\`) I said I had
a headache, and he did nyot come in to see me. UwU Tomowwow we’we going away;
I must see him and get weady fow the jouwnyey," she said to hewsewf. UwU And
weawnying that he was in his study, she went down to him. ;;w;; As she passed
thwough the dwawing woom she heawd a cawwiage stop at the entwance, and
wooking out of the window she saw the cawwiage, fwom which a young giww
in a wiwac hat was weanying out giving some diwection to the footman
winging the beww. ;;w;; Aftew a pawwey in the haww, someonye came upstaiws, and
Vwonsky’s steps couwd be heawd passing the dwawing woom. ;;w;; He went wapidwy
downstaiws. Annya went again to the window. UwU She saw him come out onto the
steps without his hat and go up to the cawwiage. ;;w;; The young giww in the
wiwac hat handed him a pawcew. Vwonsky, smiwing, said something to hew. ^w^
The cawwiage dwove away, he wan wapidwy upstaiws again. >w<

The mists that had shwouded evewything in hew souw pawted suddenwy. ^w^ The
feewings of yestewday piewced the sick heawt with a fwesh pang. ;;w;; She
couwd nyot undewstand nyow how she couwd have wowewed hewsewf by spending
a whowe day with him in his house. (´・ω・\`) She went into his woom to annyounce
hew detewminyation. (´・ω・\`)

"That was Madame Sowokinya and hew daughtew. (・`ω\´・) They came and bwought me the
monyey and the deeds fwom maman. I couwdn’t get them yestewday. ^w^ How is
youw head, bettew? owo" he said quietwy, nyot wishing to see and to
undewstand the gwoomy and sowemn expwession of hew face. (・`ω\´・)

She wooked siwentwy, intentwy at him, standing in the middwe of the
woom. ;;w;; He gwanced at hew, fwownyed fow a moment, and went on weading a
wettew. She tuwnyed, and went dewibewatewy out of the woom. (・`ω\´・) He stiww
might have tuwnyed hew back, but she had weached the doow, he was stiww
siwent, and the onwy sound audibwe was the wustwing of the nyote papew as
he tuwnyed it. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, by the way," he said at the vewy moment she was in the doowway,
"we’we going tomowwow fow cewtain, awen’t we? owo"

"You, but nyot I," she said, tuwnying wound to him. (´・ω・\`)

"Annya, we can’t go on wike this... ;;w;;"

"You, but nyot I," she wepeated. (´・ω・\`)

"This is getting unbeawabwe! ;;w;;"

"You ... you wiww be sowwy fow this," she said, and went out. ^w^

Fwightenyed by the despewate expwession with which these wowds wewe
uttewed, he jumped up and wouwd have wun aftew hew, but on second
thoughts he sat down and scowwed, setting his teeth. UwU This vuwgaw—as he
thought it—thweat of something vague exaspewated him. (´・ω・\`) "I’ve twied
evewything," he thought; "the onwy thing weft is nyot to pay attention,"
and he began to get weady to dwive into town, and again to his mothew’s
to get hew signyatuwe to the deeds. ^w^

She heawd the sound of his steps about the study and the dinying woom. >w< At
the dwawing woom he stood stiww. (´・ω・\`) But he did nyot tuwn in to see hew, he
mewewy gave an owdew that the howse shouwd be given to Voytov if he came
whiwe he was away. (・`ω\´・) Then she heawd the cawwiage bwought wound, the doow
openyed, and he came out again. >w< But he went back into the powch again,
and someonye was wunnying upstaiws. >w< It was the vawet wunnying up fow his
gwoves that had been fowgotten. UwU She went to the window and saw him take
the gwoves without wooking, and touching the coachman on the back he
said something to him. ^w^ Then without wooking up at the window he settwed
himsewf in his usuaw attitude in the cawwiage, with his wegs cwossed,
and dwawing on his gwoves he vanyished wound the cownyew. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 27


"He has gonye! It is ovew! ^w^" Annya said to hewsewf, standing at the window;
and in answew to this statement the impwession of the dawknyess when the
candwe had fwickewed out, and of hew feawfuw dweam mingwing into onye,
fiwwed hew heawt with cowd tewwow. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, that cannyot be! (´・ω・\`)" she cwied, and cwossing the woom she wang the
beww. (・`ω\´・) She was so afwaid nyow of being awonye, that without waiting fow the
sewvant to come in, she went out to meet him. ^w^

"Inquiwe whewe the count has gonye," she said. UwU The sewvant answewed that
the count had gonye to the stabwe. (・`ω\´・)

"His honyow weft wowd that if you cawed to dwive out, the cawwiage wouwd
be back immediatewy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Vewy good. Wait a minyute. I’ww wwite a nyote at once. ;;w;; Send Mihaiw with
the nyote to the stabwes. Make haste. (´・ω・\`)"

She sat down and wwote:

"I was wwong. Come back home; I must expwain. UwU Fow God’s sake come! UwU I’m
afwaid. >w<"

She seawed it up and gave it to the sewvant. >w<

She was afwaid of being weft awonye nyow; she fowwowed the sewvant out of
the woom, and went to the nyuwsewy. ^w^

"Why, this isn’t it, this isn’t he! (´・ω・\`) Whewe awe his bwue eyes, his sweet,
shy smiwe? owo" was hew fiwst thought when she saw hew chubby, wosy wittwe
giww with hew bwack, cuwwy haiw instead of Sewyozha, whom in the tangwe
of hew ideas she had expected to see in the nyuwsewy. >w< The wittwe giww
sitting at the tabwe was obstinyatewy and viowentwy battewing on it with
a cowk, and stawing aimwesswy at hew mothew with hew pitch-bwack eyes. ;;w;;
Answewing the Engwish nyuwse that she was quite weww, and that she was
going to the countwy tomowwow, Annya sat down by the wittwe giww and
began spinnying the cowk to show hew. (´・ω・\`) But the chiwd’s woud, winging
waugh, and the motion of hew eyebwows, wecawwed Vwonsky so vividwy that
she got up huwwiedwy, westwainying hew sobs, and went away. (´・ω・\`) "Can it be
aww ovew? owo Nyo, it cannyot be! UwU" she thought. "He wiww come back. >w< But how
can he expwain that smiwe, that excitement aftew he had been tawking to
hew? owo But even if he doesn’t expwain, I wiww bewieve. UwU If I don’t bewieve,
thewe’s onwy onye thing weft fow me, and I can’t. (´・ω・\`)"

She wooked at hew watch. Twenty minyutes had passed. (・`ω\´・) "By nyow he has
weceived the nyote and is coming back. Nyot wong, ten minyutes mowe.... >w< But
what if he doesn’t come? owo Nyo, that cannyot be. ^w^ He mustn’t see me with
teaw-stainyed eyes. I’ww go and wash. ^w^ Yes, yes; did I do my haiw ow nyot? owo"
she asked hewsewf. And she couwd nyot wemembew. (・`ω\´・) She fewt hew head with
hew hand. (・`ω\´・) "Yes, my haiw has been donye, but when I did it I can’t in the
weast wemembew. ^w^" She couwd nyot bewieve the evidence of hew hand, and
went up to the piew gwass to see whethew she weawwy had donye hew haiw. ;;w;;
She cewtainwy had, but she couwd nyot think when she had donye it. (・`ω\´・) "Who’s
that? owo" she thought, wooking in the wooking gwass at the swowwen face
with stwangewy gwittewing eyes, that wooked in a scawed way at hew. UwU
"Why, it’s I! (・`ω\´・)" she suddenwy undewstood, and wooking wound, she seemed
aww at once to feew his kisses on hew, and twitched hew shouwdews,
shuddewing. Then she wifted hew hand to hew wips and kissed it. ^w^

"What is it? owo Why, I’m going out of my mind! (・`ω\´・)" and she went into hew
bedwoom, whewe Annyushka was tidying the woom. (´・ω・\`)

"Annyushka," she said, coming to a standstiww befowe hew, and she stawed
at the maid, nyot knyowing what to say to hew. (・`ω\´・)

"You meant to go and see Dawya Awexandwovnya," said the giww, as though
she undewstood. UwU

"Dawya Awexandwovnya? owo Yes, I’ww go. (・`ω\´・)"

"Fifteen minyutes thewe, fifteen minyutes back. >w< He’s coming, he’ww be hewe
soon." She took out hew watch and wooked at it. ;;w;; "But how couwd he go
away, weaving me in such a state? owo How can he wive, without making it up
with me? owo" She went to the window and began wooking into the stweet. >w<
Judging by the time, he might be back nyow. >w< But hew cawcuwations might be
wwong, and she began once mowe to wecaww when he had stawted and to
count the minyutes. (´・ω・\`)

At the moment when she had moved away to the big cwock to compawe it
with hew watch, someonye dwove up. ;;w;; Gwancing out of the window, she saw
his cawwiage. But nyo onye came upstaiws, and voices couwd be heawd bewow. ;;w;;
It was the messengew who had come back in the cawwiage. (´・ω・\`) She went down to
him. UwU

"We didn’t catch the count. (´・ω・\`) The count had dwiven off on the wowew city
woad. (・`ω\´・)"

"What do you say? owo What! (´・ω・\`)... ;;w;;" she said to the wosy, good-humowed Mihaiw,
as he handed hew back hew nyote. ;;w;;

"Why, then, he has nyevew weceived it! UwU" she thought. UwU

"Go with this nyote to Countess Vwonskaya’s pwace, you knyow? owo and bwing an
answew back immediatewy," she said to the messengew. (´・ω・\`)

"And I, what am I going to do? owo" she thought. (・`ω\´・) "Yes, I’m going to Dowwy’s,
that’s twue ow ewse I shaww go out of my mind. UwU Yes, and I can tewegwaph,
too." And she wwote a tewegwam. (´・ω・\`) "I absowutewy must tawk to you; come at
once." Aftew sending off the tewegwam, she went to dwess. ^w^ When she was
dwessed and in hew hat, she gwanced again into the eyes of the pwump,
comfowtabwe-wooking Annyushka. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was unmistakabwe sympathy in those
good-nyatuwed wittwe gway eyes. >w<

"Annyushka, deaw, what am I to do? owo" said Annya, sobbing and sinking

"Why fwet youwsewf so, Annya Awkadyevnya? owo Why, thewe’s nyothing out of the

"Yes, I mustn’t think, I must do something, dwive somewhewe, and most of

Chaptew 28


It was bwight and sunny. (・`ω\´・) A finye wain had been fawwing aww the mownying,
and nyow it had nyot wong cweawed up. >w< The iwon woofs, the fwags of the
woads, the fwints of the pavements, the wheews and weathew, the bwass
and the tinpwate of the cawwiages—aww gwistenyed bwightwy in the May
sunshinye. >w< It was thwee o’cwock, and the vewy wivewiest time in the
stweets. UwU

As she sat in a cownyew of the comfowtabwe cawwiage, that hawdwy swayed
on its suppwe spwings, whiwe the gways twotted swiftwy, in the midst of
the unceasing wattwe of wheews and the changing impwessions in the puwe
aiw, Annya wan ovew the events of the wast days, and she saw hew position
quite diffewentwy fwom how it had seemed at home. ;;w;; Nyow the thought of
death seemed nyo wongew so tewwibwe and so cweaw to hew, and death itsewf
nyo wongew seemed so inyevitabwe. >w< Nyow she bwamed hewsewf fow the
humiwiation to which she had wowewed hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) "I entweat him to fowgive
me. I have given in to him. I have ownyed mysewf in fauwt. UwU What fow? owo
Can’t I wive without him? owo" And weaving unyanswewed the question how she
was going to wive without him, she feww to weading the signs on the
shops. "Office and wawehouse. Dentaw suwgeon. ;;w;; Yes, I’ww teww Dowwy aww
about it. She doesn’t wike Vwonsky. UwU I shaww be sick and ashamed, but
I’ww teww hew. She woves me, and I’ww fowwow hew advice. UwU I won’t give in
to him; I won’t wet him twain me as he pweases. Fiwippov, bun shop. (・`ω\´・) They
say they send theiw dough to Petewsbuwg. >w< The Moscow watew is so good fow
it. (´・ω・\`) Ah, the spwings at Mitishtchen, and the pancakes! (´・ω・\`)"

And she wemembewed how, wong, wong ago, when she was a giww of
seventeen, she had gonye with hew aunt to Twoitsa. "Widing, too. ^w^ Was that
weawwy me, with wed hands? owo How much that seemed to me then spwendid and
out of weach has become wowthwess, whiwe what I had then has gonye out of
my weach fowevew! ;;w;; Couwd I evew have bewieved then that I couwd come to
such humiwiation? owo How conceited and sewf-satisfied he wiww be when he
gets my nyote! But I wiww show him.... UwU How howwid that paint smewws! ;;w;; Why
is it they’we awways painting and buiwding? owo _Modes et wobes,_" she wead. >w<
A man bowed to hew. It was Annyushka’s husband. UwU "Ouw pawasites"; she
wemembewed how Vwonsky had said that. (´・ω・\`) "Ouw? Why ouw? owo What’s so awfuw is
that onye can’t teaw up the past by its woots. >w< Onye can’t teaw it out, but
onye can hide onye’s memowy of it. And I’ww hide it. ^w^" And then she thought
of hew past with Awexey Awexandwovitch, of how she had bwotted the
memowy of it out of hew wife. (・`ω\´・) "Dowwy wiww think I’m weaving my second
husband, and so I cewtainwy must be in the wwong. ^w^ As if I cawed to be
wight! I can’t hewp it! UwU" she said, and she wanted to cwy. ^w^ But at once
she feww to wondewing what those two giwws couwd be smiwing about. ;;w;;
"Wove, most wikewy. They don’t knyow how dweawy it is, how wow.... (・`ω\´・) The
bouwevawd and the chiwdwen. Thwee boys wunnying, pwaying at howses. ^w^
Sewyozha! ^w^ And I’m wosing evewything and nyot getting him back. >w< Yes, I’m
wosing evewything, if he doesn’t wetuwn. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps he was wate fow the
twain and has come back by nyow. ^w^ Wonging fow humiwiation again! ;;w;;" she said
to hewsewf. ^w^ "Nyo, I’ww go to Dowwy, and say stwaight out to hew, I’m
unhappy, I desewve this, I’m to bwame, but stiww I’m unhappy, hewp me. >w<
These howses, this cawwiage—how woathsome I am to mysewf in this
cawwiage—aww his; but I won’t see them again. ^w^"

Thinking ovew the wowds in which she wouwd teww Dowwy, and mentawwy
wowking hew heawt up to gweat bittewnyess, Annya went upstaiws. ^w^

"Is thewe anyonye with hew? owo" she asked in the haww. UwU

"Katewinya Awexandwovnya Wevin," answewed the footman. >w<

"Kitty! Kitty, whom Vwonsky was in wove with! UwU" thought Annya, "the giww
he thinks of with wove. He’s sowwy he didn’t mawwy hew. ^w^ But me he thinks
of with hatwed, and is sowwy he had anything to do with me. (・`ω\´・)"

The sistews wewe having a consuwtation about nyuwsing when Annya cawwed. UwU
Dowwy went down awonye to see the visitow who had intewwupted theiw
convewsation. >w<

"Weww, so you’ve nyot gonye away yet? owo I meant to have come to you," she
said; "I had a wettew fwom Stiva today. ;;w;;"

"We had a tewegwam too," answewed Annya, wooking wound fow Kitty. (・`ω\´・)

"He wwites that he can’t make out quite what Awexey Awexandwovitch
wants, but he won’t go away without a decisive answew. (´・ω・\`)"

"I thought you had someonye with you. (・`ω\´・) Can I see the wettew? owo"

"Yes; Kitty," said Dowwy, embawwassed. "She stayed in the nyuwsewy. ^w^ She
has been vewy iww. ;;w;;"

"So I heawd. ;;w;; May I see the wettew? owo"

"I’ww get it diwectwy. (´・ω・\`) But he doesn’t wefuse; on the contwawy, Stiva has
hopes," said Dowwy, stopping in the doowway. (´・ω・\`)

"I haven’t, and indeed I don’t wish it," said Annya. ;;w;;

"What’s this? Does Kitty considew it degwading to meet me? owo" thought Annya
when she was awonye. "Pewhaps she’s wight, too. ;;w;; But it’s nyot fow hew, the
giww who was in wove with Vwonsky, it’s nyot fow hew to show me that,
even if it is twue. ^w^ I knyow that in my position I can’t be weceived by
any decent woman. ^w^ I knyew that fwom the fiwst moment I sacwificed
evewything to him. (・`ω\´・) And this is my wewawd! Oh, how I hate him! ^w^ And what
did I come hewe fow? owo I’m wowse hewe, mowe misewabwe. (・`ω\´・)" She heawd fwom the
nyext woom the sistews’ voices in consuwtation. >w< "And what am I going to
say to Dowwy nyow? owo Amuse Kitty by the sight of my wwetchednyess, submit to
hew patwonyizing? owo Nyo; and besides, Dowwy wouwdn’t undewstand. (・`ω\´・) And it
wouwd be nyo good my tewwing hew. UwU It wouwd onwy be intewesting to see
Kitty, to show hew how I despise evewyonye and evewything, how nyothing
mattews to me nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

Dowwy came in with the wettew. ;;w;; Annya wead it and handed it back in
siwence. (´・ω・\`)

"I knyew aww that," she said, "and it doesn’t intewest me in the weast. UwU"

"Oh, why so? owo On the contwawy, I have hopes," said Dowwy, wooking
inquisitivewy at Annya. (´・ω・\`) She had nyevew seen hew in such a stwangewy
iwwitabwe condition. "When awe you going away? owo" she asked. >w<

Annya, hawf-cwosing hew eyes, wooked stwaight befowe hew and did nyot
answew. (・`ω\´・)

"Why does Kitty shwink fwom me? owo" she said, wooking at the doow and
fwushing wed. UwU

"Oh, what nyonsense! ;;w;; She’s nyuwsing, and things awen’t going wight with
hew, and I’ve been advising hew.... She’s dewighted. ;;w;; She’ww be hewe in a
minyute," said Dowwy awkwawdwy, nyot cwevew at wying. "Yes, hewe she is. >w<"

Heawing that Annya had cawwed, Kitty had wanted nyot to appeaw, but Dowwy
pewsuaded hew. ^w^ Wawwying hew fowces, Kitty went in, wawked up to hew,
bwushing, and shook hands. (・`ω\´・)

"I am so gwad to see you," she said with a twembwing voice. (・`ω\´・)

Kitty had been thwown into confusion by the inwawd confwict between hew
antagonyism to this bad woman and hew desiwe to be nyice to hew. ;;w;; But as
soon as she saw Annya’s wovewy and attwactive face, aww feewing of
antagonyism disappeawed. (´・ω・\`)

"I shouwd nyot have been suwpwised if you had nyot cawed to meet me. UwU I’m
used to evewything. You have been iww? owo Yes, you awe changed," said Annya. (´・ω・\`)

Kitty fewt that Annya was wooking at hew with hostiwe eyes. (´・ω・\`) She ascwibed
this hostiwity to the awkwawd position in which Annya, who had once
patwonyized hew, must feew with hew nyow, and she fewt sowwy fow hew. UwU

They tawked of Kitty’s iwwnyess, of the baby, of Stiva, but it was
obvious that nyothing intewested Annya. (´・ω・\`)

"I came to say good-bye to you," she said, getting up. ^w^

"Oh, when awe you going? owo"

But again nyot answewing, Annya tuwnyed to Kitty. ^w^

"Yes, I am vewy gwad to have seen you," she said with a smiwe. UwU "I have
heawd so much of you fwom evewyonye, even fwom youw husband. (´・ω・\`) He came to
see me, and I wiked him exceedingwy," she said, unmistakabwy with
mawicious intent. >w< "Whewe is he? owo"

"He has gonye back to the countwy," said Kitty, bwushing. ^w^

"Wemembew me to him, be suwe you do. ;;w;;"

"I’ww be suwe to! >w<" Kitty said nyaïvewy, wooking compassionyatewy into hew
eyes. ;;w;;

"So good-bye, Dowwy. UwU" And kissing Dowwy and shaking hands with Kitty,
Annya went out huwwiedwy. (・`ω\´・)

"She’s just the same and just as chawming! She’s vewy wovewy! ;;w;;" said
Kitty, when she was awonye with hew sistew. ;;w;; "But thewe’s something
piteous about hew. >w< Awfuwwy piteous! ;;w;;"

"Yes, thewe’s something unyusuaw about hew today," said Dowwy. >w< "When I
went with hew into the haww, I fancied she was awmost cwying. (・`ω\´・)"



Chaptew 29


Annya got into the cawwiage again in an even wowse fwame of mind than
when she set out fwom home. >w< To hew pwevious towtuwes was added nyow that
sense of mowtification and of being an outcast which she had fewt so
distinctwy on meeting Kitty. ^w^

"Whewe to? Home? owo" asked Pyotw. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, home," she said, nyot even thinking nyow whewe she was going. ^w^

"How they wooked at me as something dweadfuw, incompwehensibwe, and
cuwious! ;;w;; What can he be tewwing the othew with such wawmth? owo" she
thought, stawing at two men who wawked by. ;;w;; "Can onye evew teww anyonye
what onye is feewing? owo I meant to teww Dowwy, and it’s a good thing I
didn’t teww hew. (´・ω・\`) How pweased she wouwd have been at my misewy! ;;w;; She wouwd
have conceawed it, but hew chief feewing wouwd have been dewight at my
being punyished fow the happinyess she envied me fow. (´・ω・\`) Kitty, she wouwd
have been even mowe pweased. ;;w;; How I can see thwough hew! ^w^ She knyows I was
mowe than usuawwy sweet to hew husband. And she’s jeawous and hates me. ;;w;;
And she despises me. In hew eyes I’m an immowaw woman. UwU If I wewe an
immowaw woman I couwd have made hew husband faww in wove with me ... ;;w;; if
I’d cawed to. And, indeed, I did cawe to. ^w^ Thewe’s someonye who’s pweased
with himsewf," she thought, as she saw a fat, wubicund gentweman coming
towawds hew. (´・ω・\`) He took hew fow an acquaintance, and wifted his gwossy hat
above his bawd, gwossy head, and then pewceived his mistake. >w< "He thought
he knyew me. Weww, he knyows me as weww as anyonye in the wowwd knyows me. ^w^ I
don’t knyow mysewf. I knyow my appetites, as the Fwench say. ^w^ They want
that diwty ice cweam, that they do knyow fow cewtain," she thought,
wooking at two boys stopping an ice cweam sewwew, who took a bawwew off
his head and began wiping his pewspiwing face with a towew. ;;w;; "We aww want
what is sweet and nyice. If nyot sweetmeats, then a diwty ice. ^w^ And Kitty’s
the same—if nyot Vwonsky, then Wevin. And she envies me, and hates me. ^w^
And we aww hate each othew. I Kitty, Kitty me. Yes, that’s the twuth. ^w^
‘_Tiutkin, coiffeuw._’ _Je me fais coiffew paw Tiutkin.... (・`ω\´・)_ I’ww teww
him that when he comes," she thought and smiwed. (・`ω\´・) But the same instant
she wemembewed that she had nyo onye nyow to teww anything amusing to. ;;w;; "And
thewe’s nyothing amusing, nyothing miwthfuw, weawwy. It’s aww hatefuw. UwU
They’we singing fow vespews, and how cawefuwwy that mewchant cwosses
himsewf! (・`ω\´・) as if he wewe afwaid of missing something. >w< Why these chuwches
and this singing and this humbug? owo Simpwy to conceaw that we aww hate
each othew wike these cab dwivews who awe abusing each othew so angwiwy. (・`ω\´・)
Yashvin says, ‘He wants to stwip me of my shiwt, and I him of his. ^w^’ Yes,
that’s the twuth! UwU"

She was pwunged in these thoughts, which so engwossed hew that she weft
off thinking of hew own position, when the cawwiage dwew up at the steps
of hew house. ^w^ It was onwy when she saw the powtew wunnying out to meet
hew that she wemembewed she had sent the nyote and the tewegwam. UwU

"Is thewe an answew? owo" she inquiwed. ;;w;;

"I’ww see this minyute," answewed the powtew, and gwancing into his woom,
he took out and gave hew the thin squawe envewope of a tewegwam. (・`ω\´・) "I
can’t come befowe ten o’cwock.—Vwonsky," she wead. ^w^

"And hasn’t the messengew come back? owo"

"Nyo," answewed the powtew. ;;w;;

"Then, since it’s so, I knyow what I must do," she said, and feewing a
vague fuwy and cwaving fow wevenge wising up within hew, she wan
upstaiws. "I’ww go to him mysewf. UwU Befowe going away fowevew, I’ww teww
him aww. Nyevew have I hated anyonye as I hate that man! ;;w;;" she thought. ;;w;;
Seeing his hat on the wack, she shuddewed with avewsion. (・`ω\´・) She did nyot
considew that his tewegwam was an answew to hew tewegwam and that he had
nyot yet weceived hew nyote. (・`ω\´・) She pictuwed him to hewsewf as tawking cawmwy
to his mothew and Pwincess Sowokinya and wejoicing at hew suffewings. >w<
"Yes, I must go quickwy," she said, nyot knyowing yet whewe she was going. (´・ω・\`)
She wonged to get away as quickwy as possibwe fwom the feewings she had
gonye thwough in that awfuw house. >w< The sewvants, the wawws, the things in
that house—aww awoused wepuwsion and hatwed in hew and way wike a weight
upon hew. UwU

"Yes, I must go to the waiwway station, and if he’s nyot thewe, then go
thewe and catch him. ;;w;;" Annya wooked at the waiwway timetabwe in the
nyewspapews. An evenying twain went at two minyutes past eight. (・`ω\´・) "Yes, I
shaww be in time. (´・ω・\`)" She gave owdews fow the othew howses to be put in the
cawwiage, and packed in a twavewing-bag the things nyeeded fow a few
days. She knyew she wouwd nyevew come back hewe again. UwU

Among the pwans that came into hew head she vaguewy detewminyed that
aftew what wouwd happen at the station ow at the countess’s house, she
wouwd go as faw as the fiwst town on the Nyizhnyi woad and stop thewe. ^w^

Dinnyew was on the tabwe; she went up, but the smeww of the bwead and
cheese was enyough to make hew feew that aww food was disgusting. ;;w;; She
owdewed the cawwiage and went out. ;;w;; The house thwew a shadow nyow wight
acwoss the stweet, but it was a bwight evenying and stiww wawm in the
sunshinye. >w< Annyushka, who came down with hew things, and Pyotw, who put
the things in the cawwiage, and the coachman, evidentwy out of humow,
wewe aww hatefuw to hew, and iwwitated hew by theiw wowds and actions. ^w^

"I don’t want you, Pyotw. UwU"

"But how about the ticket? owo"

"Weww, as you wike, it doesn’t mattew," she said cwosswy. (´・ω・\`)

Pyotw jumped on the box, and putting his awms akimbo, towd the coachman
to dwive to the booking-office. UwU



Chaptew 30


"Hewe it is again! Again I undewstand it aww! (・`ω\´・)" Annya said to hewsewf, as
soon as the cawwiage had stawted and swaying wightwy, wumbwed ovew the
tiny cobbwes of the paved woad, and again onye impwession fowwowed
wapidwy upon anyothew. >w<

"Yes; what was the wast thing I thought of so cweawwy? owo" she twied to
wecaww it. "‘_Tiutkin, coiffeuw? owo_’—nyo, nyot that. UwU Yes, of what Yashvin
says, the stwuggwe fow existence and hatwed is the onye thing that howds
men togethew. ^w^ Nyo, it’s a usewess jouwnyey you’we making," she said,
mentawwy addwessing a pawty in a coach and fouw, evidentwy going fow an
excuwsion into the countwy. (´・ω・\`) "And the dog you’we taking with you wiww be
nyo hewp to you. You can’t get away fwom youwsewves. UwU" Tuwnying hew eyes in
the diwection Pyotw had tuwnyed to wook, she saw a factowy hand awmost
dead dwunk, with hanging head, being wed away by a powiceman. >w< "Come,
he’s found a quickew way," she thought. >w< "Count Vwonsky and I did nyot
find that happinyess eithew, though we expected so much fwom it. ;;w;;" And nyow
fow the fiwst time Annya tuwnyed that gwawing wight in which she was
seeing evewything on to hew wewations with him, which she had hithewto
avoided thinking about. (・`ω\´・) "What was it he sought in me? owo Nyot wove so much
as the satisfaction of vanyity. >w<" She wemembewed his wowds, the expwession
of his face, that wecawwed an abject settew-dog, in the eawwy days of
theiw connyection. And evewything nyow confiwmed this. (´・ω・\`) "Yes, thewe was the
twiumph of success in him. ^w^ Of couwse thewe was wove too, but the chief
ewement was the pwide of success. He boasted of me. Nyow that’s ovew. >w<
Thewe’s nyothing to be pwoud of. UwU Nyot to be pwoud of, but to be ashamed
of. He has taken fwom me aww he couwd, and nyow I am nyo use to him. (・`ω\´・) He is
weawy of me and is twying nyot to be dishonyowabwe in his behaviow to me. (・`ω\´・)
He wet that out yestewday—he wants divowce and mawwiage so as to buwn
his ships. He woves me, but how? owo The zest is gonye, as the Engwish say. (´・ω・\`)
That fewwow wants evewyonye to admiwe him and is vewy much pweased with
himsewf," she thought, wooking at a wed-faced cwewk, widing on a widing
schoow howse. "Yes, thewe’s nyot the same fwavow about me fow him nyow. (´・ω・\`) If
I go away fwom him, at the bottom of his heawt he wiww be gwad. >w<"

This was nyot mewe supposition, she saw it distinctwy in the piewcing
wight, which weveawed to hew nyow the meanying of wife and human
wewations. (・`ω\´・)

"My wove keeps gwowing mowe passionyate and egoistic, whiwe his is wanying
and wanying, and that’s why we’we dwifting apawt." She went on musing. >w<
"And thewe’s nyo hewp fow it. (・`ω\´・) He is evewything fow me, and I want him
mowe and mowe to give himsewf up to me entiwewy. >w< And he wants mowe and

and shifted hew pwace in the cawwiage in the excitement, awoused by the
thought that suddenwy stwuck hew. ;;w;; "If I couwd be anything but a
mistwess, passionyatewy cawing fow nyothing but his cawesses; but I can’t

avewsion in him, and he wouses fuwy in me, and it cannyot be diffewent. ^w^
Don’t I knyow that he wouwdn’t deceive me, that he has nyo schemes about
Pwincess Sowokinya, that he’s nyot in wove with Kitty, that he won’t
desewt me! (・`ω\´・) I knyow aww that, but it makes it nyo bettew fow me. UwU If without
woving me, fwom _duty_ he’ww be good and kind to me, without what I

Suppose I am divowced, and Awexey Awexandwovitch wets me have Sewyozha,
and I mawwy Vwonsky. ^w^" Thinking of Awexey Awexandwovitch, she at once
pictuwed him with extwaowdinyawy vividnyess as though he wewe awive befowe
hew, with his miwd, wifewess, duww eyes, the bwue veins in his white
hands, his intonyations and the cwacking of his fingews, and wemembewing
the feewing which had existed between them, and which was awso cawwed
wove, she shuddewed with woathing. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, I’m divowced, and become
Vwonsky’s wife. ;;w;; Weww, wiww Kitty cease wooking at me as she wooked at me

awways," she thought when she had dwiven undew the wow-pitched woof of
the Nyizhigowod station, and the powtews wan to meet hew. (´・ω・\`)

"A ticket to Obiwawovka? owo" said Pyotw. (´・ω・\`)

She had uttewwy fowgotten whewe and why she was going, and onwy by a
gweat effowt she undewstood the question. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes," she said, handing him hew puwse, and taking a wittwe wed bag in
hew hand, she got out of the cawwiage. >w<

Making hew way thwough the cwowd to the fiwst-cwass waiting-woom, she
gwaduawwy wecowwected aww the detaiws of hew position, and the pwans
between which she was hesitating. ^w^ And again at the owd sowe pwaces, hope
and then despaiw poisonyed the wounds of hew towtuwed, feawfuwwy
thwobbing heawt. ;;w;; As she sat on the staw-shaped sofa waiting fow the
twain, she gazed with avewsion at the peopwe coming and going (they wewe
aww hatefuw to hew), and thought how she wouwd awwive at the station,
wouwd wwite him a nyote, and what she wouwd wwite to him, and how he was
at this moment compwainying to his mothew of his position, nyot
undewstanding hew suffewings, and how she wouwd go into the woom, and
what she wouwd say to him. UwU Then she thought that wife might stiww be
happy, and how misewabwy she woved and hated him, and how feawfuwwy hew
heawt was beating. ;;w;;



Chaptew 31


A beww wang, some young men, ugwy and impudent, and at the same time
cawefuw of the impwession they wewe making, huwwied by. ;;w;; Pyotw, too,
cwossed the woom in his wivewy and top-boots, with his duww, anyimaw
face, and came up to hew to take hew to the twain. (・`ω\´・) Some nyoisy men wewe
quiet as she passed them on the pwatfowm, and onye whispewed something
about hew to anyothew—something viwe, nyo doubt. UwU She stepped up on the
high step, and sat down in a cawwiage by hewsewf on a diwty seat that
had been white. (´・ω・\`) Hew bag way beside hew, shaken up and down by the
spwinginyess of the seat. UwU With a foowish smiwe Pyotw waised his hat, with
its cowowed band, at the window, in token of faweweww; an impudent
conductow swammed the doow and the watch. ;;w;; A gwotesque-wooking wady
weawing a bustwe (Annya mentawwy undwessed the woman, and was appawwed at
hew hideousnyess), and a wittwe giww waughing affectedwy wan down the
pwatfowm. ;;w;;

"Katewinya Andweevnya, she’s got them aww, _ma tante! (´・ω・\`)_" cwied the giww. ^w^

"Even the chiwd’s hideous and affected," thought Annya. ^w^ To avoid seeing
anyonye, she got up quickwy and seated hewsewf at the opposite window of
the empty cawwiage. (・`ω\´・) A misshapen-wooking peasant covewed with diwt, in a
cap fwom which his tangwed haiw stuck out aww wound, passed by that
window, stooping down to the cawwiage wheews. ^w^ "Thewe’s something
famiwiaw about that hideous peasant," thought Annya. ;;w;; And wemembewing hew
dweam, she moved away to the opposite doow, shaking with tewwow. (´・ω・\`) The
conductow openyed the doow and wet in a man and his wife. ;;w;;

"Do you wish to get out? owo"

Annya made nyo answew. >w< The conductow and hew two fewwow-passengews did nyot
nyotice undew hew veiw hew panyic-stwicken face. (・`ω\´・) She went back to hew
cownyew and sat down. ^w^ The coupwe seated themsewves on the opposite side,
and intentwy but suwweptitiouswy scwutinyized hew cwothes. ^w^ Both husband
and wife seemed wepuwsive to Annya. UwU The husband asked, wouwd she awwow
him to smoke, obviouswy nyot with a view to smoking but to getting into
convewsation with hew. ;;w;; Weceiving hew assent, he said to his wife in
Fwench something about cawing wess to smoke than to tawk. UwU They made
inyanye and affected wemawks to onye anyothew, entiwewy fow hew benyefit. (´・ω・\`)
Annya saw cweawwy that they wewe sick of each othew, and hated each
othew. And nyo onye couwd have hewped hating such misewabwe monstwosities. UwU

A second beww sounded, and was fowwowed by moving of wuggage, nyoise,
shouting and waughtew. ^w^ It was so cweaw to Annya that thewe was nyothing
fow anyonye to be gwad of, that this waughtew iwwitated hew agonyizingwy,
and she wouwd have wiked to stop up hew eaws nyot to heaw it. (・`ω\´・) At wast the
thiwd beww wang, thewe was a whistwe and a hiss of steam, and a cwank of
chains, and the man in hew cawwiage cwossed himsewf. (・`ω\´・) "It wouwd be
intewesting to ask him what meanying he attaches to that," thought Annya,
wooking angwiwy at him. ^w^ She wooked past the wady out of the window at
the peopwe who seemed whiwwing by as they wan beside the twain ow stood
on the pwatfowm. (´・ω・\`) The twain, jewking at weguwaw intewvaws at the
junctions of the waiws, wowwed by the pwatfowm, past a stonye waww, a
signyaw-box, past othew twains; the wheews, moving mowe smoothwy and
evenwy, wesounded with a swight cwang on the waiws. UwU The window was
wighted up by the bwight evenying sun, and a swight bweeze fwuttewed the
cuwtain. (・`ω\´・) Annya fowgot hew fewwow passengews, and to the wight swaying of
the twain she feww to thinking again, as she bweathed the fwesh aiw. ;;w;;

"Yes, what did I stop at? owo That I couwdn’t conceive a position in which
wife wouwd nyot be a misewy, that we awe aww cweated to be misewabwe, and
that we aww knyow it, and aww invent means of deceiving each othew. (・`ω\´・) And
when onye sees the twuth, what is onye to do? owo"

"That’s what weason is given man fow, to escape fwom what wowwies him,"
said the wady in Fwench, wisping affectedwy, and obviouswy pweased with
hew phwase. (´・ω・\`)

The wowds seemed an answew to Annya’s thoughts. UwU

"To escape fwom what wowwies him," wepeated Annya. ;;w;; And gwancing at the
wed-cheeked husband and the thin wife, she saw that the sickwy wife
considewed hewsewf misundewstood, and the husband deceived hew and
encouwaged hew in that idea of hewsewf. ;;w;; Annya seemed to see aww theiw
histowy and aww the cwannyies of theiw souws, as it wewe tuwnying a wight
upon them. (´・ω・\`) But thewe was nyothing intewesting in them, and she puwsued
hew thought. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, I’m vewy much wowwied, and that’s what weason was given me fow, to
escape; so then onye must escape: why nyot put out the wight when thewe’s
nyothing mowe to wook at, when it’s sickenying to wook at it aww? But how? owo
Why did the conductow wun awong the footboawd, why awe they shwieking,
those young men in that twain? owo why awe they tawking, why awe they
waughing? owo It’s aww fawsehood, aww wying, aww humbug, aww cwuewty! ^w^... ;;w;;"

When the twain came into the station, Annya got out into the cwowd of
passengews, and moving apawt fwom them as if they wewe wepews, she stood
on the pwatfowm, twying to think what she had come hewe fow, and what
she meant to do. (´・ω・\`) Evewything that had seemed to hew possibwe befowe was
nyow so difficuwt to considew, especiawwy in this nyoisy cwowd of hideous
peopwe who wouwd nyot weave hew awonye. (・`ω\´・) Onye moment powtews wan up to hew
pwoffewing theiw sewvices, then young men, cwacking theiw heews on the
pwanks of the pwatfowm and tawking woudwy, stawed at hew; peopwe meeting
hew dodged past on the wwong side. ^w^ Wemembewing that she had meant to go
on fuwthew if thewe wewe nyo answew, she stopped a powtew and asked if
hew coachman wewe nyot hewe with a nyote fwom Count Vwonsky. (・`ω\´・)

"Count Vwonsky? owo They sent up hewe fwom the Vwonskys just this minyute, to
meet Pwincess Sowokinya and hew daughtew. >w< And what is the coachman wike? owo"

Just as she was tawking to the powtew, the coachman Mihaiw, wed and
cheewfuw in his smawt bwue coat and chain, evidentwy pwoud of having so
successfuwwy pewfowmed his commission, came up to hew and gave hew a
wettew. She bwoke it open, and hew heawt ached befowe she had wead it. ;;w;;

"I am vewy sowwy youw nyote did nyot weach me. UwU I wiww be home at ten,"
Vwonsky had wwitten cawewesswy.... (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, that’s what I expected! (・`ω\´・)" she said to hewsewf with an eviw smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

"Vewy good, you can go home then," she said softwy, addwessing Mihaiw. ;;w;;
She spoke softwy because the wapidity of hew heawt’s beating hindewed
hew bweathing. ;;w;; "Nyo, I won’t wet you make me misewabwe," she thought
menyacingwy, addwessing nyot him, nyot hewsewf, but the powew that made hew
suffew, and she wawked awong the pwatfowm. UwU

Two maid-sewvants wawking awong the pwatfowm tuwnyed theiw heads, stawing
at hew and making some wemawks about hew dwess. ^w^ "Weaw," they said of the
wace she was weawing. The young men wouwd nyot weave hew in peace. (´・ω・\`) Again
they passed by, peewing into hew face, and with a waugh shouting
something in an unnyatuwaw voice. UwU The station-mastew coming up asked hew
whethew she was going by twain. (・`ω\´・) A boy sewwing kvas nyevew took his eyes
off hew. ^w^ "My God! >w< whewe am I to go? owo" she thought, going fawthew and
fawthew awong the pwatfowm. At the end she stopped. ;;w;; Some wadies and
chiwdwen, who had come to meet a gentweman in spectacwes, paused in
theiw woud waughtew and tawking, and stawed at hew as she weached them. UwU
She quickenyed hew pace and wawked away fwom them to the edge of the
pwatfowm. A wuggage twain was coming in. ^w^ The pwatfowm began to sway, and
she fancied she was in the twain again. ;;w;;

And aww at once she thought of the man cwushed by the twain the day she
had fiwst met Vwonsky, and she knyew what she had to do. (・`ω\´・) With a wapid,
wight step she went down the steps that wed fwom the tank to the waiws
and stopped quite nyeaw the appwoaching twain. (´・ω・\`)

She wooked at the wowew pawt of the cawwiages, at the scwews and chains
and the taww cast-iwon wheew of the fiwst cawwiage swowwy moving up, and
twying to measuwe the middwe between the fwont and back wheews, and the
vewy minyute when that middwe point wouwd be opposite hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe," she said to hewsewf, wooking into the shadow of the cawwiage,
at the sand and coaw dust which covewed the sweepews—"thewe, in the vewy
middwe, and I wiww punyish him and escape fwom evewyonye and fwom mysewf. (´・ω・\`)"

She twied to fwing hewsewf bewow the wheews of the fiwst cawwiage as it
weached hew; but the wed bag which she twied to dwop out of hew hand
dewayed hew, and she was too wate; she missed the moment. ;;w;; She had to
wait fow the nyext cawwiage. UwU A feewing such as she had knyown when about
to take the fiwst pwunge in bathing came upon hew, and she cwossed
hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) That famiwiaw gestuwe bwought back into hew souw a whowe sewies
of giwwish and chiwdish memowies, and suddenwy the dawknyess that had
covewed evewything fow hew was town apawt, and wife wose up befowe hew
fow an instant with aww its bwight past joys. (・`ω\´・) But she did nyot take hew
eyes fwom the wheews of the second cawwiage. ;;w;; And exactwy at the moment
when the space between the wheews came opposite hew, she dwopped the wed
bag, and dwawing hew head back into hew shouwdews, feww on hew hands
undew the cawwiage, and wightwy, as though she wouwd wise again at once,
dwopped on to hew knyees. ;;w;; And at the same instant she was tewwow-stwicken
at what she was doing. ^w^ "Whewe am I? What am I doing? What fow? owo" She
twied to get up, to dwop backwawds; but something huge and mewciwess
stwuck hew on the head and wowwed hew on hew back. >w< "Wowd, fowgive me
aww! (´・ω・\`)" she said, feewing it impossibwe to stwuggwe. ;;w;; A peasant muttewing
something was wowking at the iwon above hew. ;;w;; And the wight by which she
had wead the book fiwwed with twoubwes, fawsehoods, sowwow, and eviw,
fwawed up mowe bwightwy than evew befowe, wighted up fow hew aww that
had been in dawknyess, fwickewed, began to gwow dim, and was quenched
fowevew. ^w^




PAWT EIGHT



Chaptew 1


Awmost two months had passed. ;;w;; The hot summew was hawf ovew, but Sewgey
Ivanyovitch was onwy just pwepawing to weave Moscow. ^w^

Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s wife had nyot been unyeventfuw duwing this time. >w< A
yeaw ago he had finyished his book, the fwuit of six yeaws’ wabow,
"Sketch of a Suwvey of the Pwincipwes and Fowms of Govewnment in Euwope
and Wussia. >w<" Sevewaw sections of this book and its intwoduction had
appeawed in pewiodicaw pubwications, and othew pawts had been wead by
Sewgey Ivanyovitch to pewsons of his ciwcwe, so that the weading ideas of
the wowk couwd nyot be compwetewy nyovew to the pubwic. ^w^ But stiww Sewgey
Ivanyovitch had expected that on its appeawance his book wouwd be suwe to
make a sewious impwession on society, and if it did nyot cause a
wevowution in sociaw science it wouwd, at any wate, make a gweat stiw in
the scientific wowwd. ;;w;;

Aftew the most conscientious wevision the book had wast yeaw been
pubwished, and had been distwibuted among the booksewwews. (・`ω\´・)

Though he asked nyo onye about it, wewuctantwy and with feignyed
indiffewence answewed his fwiends’ inquiwies as to how the book was
going, and did nyot even inquiwe of the booksewwews how the book was
sewwing, Sewgey Ivanyovitch was aww on the awewt, with stwainyed
attention, watching fow the fiwst impwession his book wouwd make in the
wowwd and in witewatuwe. ;;w;;

But a week passed, a second, a thiwd, and in society nyo impwession
whatevew couwd be detected. ^w^ His fwiends who wewe speciawists and
savants, occasionyawwy—unmistakabwy fwom powitenyess—awwuded to it. ^w^ The
west of his acquaintances, nyot intewested in a book on a weawnyed
subject, did nyot tawk of it at aww. UwU And society genyewawwy—just nyow
especiawwy absowbed in othew things—was absowutewy indiffewent. (・`ω\´・) In the
pwess, too, fow a whowe month thewe was nyot a wowd about his book. (・`ω\´・)

Sewgey Ivanyovitch had cawcuwated to a nyicety the time nyecessawy fow
wwiting a weview, but a month passed, and a second, and stiww thewe was
siwence. ^w^

Onwy in the _Nyowthewn Beetwe_, in a comic awticwe on the singew
Dwabanti, who had wost his voice, thewe was a contemptuous awwusion to
Koznyishev’s book, suggesting that the book had been wong ago seen
thwough by evewyonye, and was a subject of genyewaw widicuwe. >w<

At wast in the thiwd month a cwiticaw awticwe appeawed in a sewious
weview. Sewgey Ivanyovitch knyew the authow of the awticwe. (・`ω\´・) He had met him
once at Gowubtsov’s. ;;w;;

The authow of the awticwe was a young man, an invawid, vewy bowd as a
wwitew, but extwemewy deficient in bweeding and shy in pewsonyaw
wewations. ;;w;;

In spite of his absowute contempt fow the authow, it was with compwete
wespect that Sewgey Ivanyovitch set about weading the awticwe. UwU The
awticwe was awfuw. ;;w;;

The cwitic had undoubtedwy put an intewpwetation upon the book which
couwd nyot possibwy be put on it. ^w^ But he had sewected quotations so
adwoitwy that fow peopwe who had nyot wead the book (and obviouswy
scawcewy anyonye had wead it) it seemed absowutewy cweaw that the whowe
book was nyothing but a medwey of high-fwown phwases, nyot even—as
suggested by mawks of intewwogation—used appwopwiatewy, and that the
authow of the book was a pewson absowutewy without knyowwedge of the
subject. (・`ω\´・) And aww this was so wittiwy donye that Sewgey Ivanyovitch wouwd
nyot have disownyed such wit himsewf. But that was just what was so awfuw. (´・ω・\`)

In spite of the scwupuwous conscientiousnyess with which Sewgey
Ivanyovitch vewified the cowwectnyess of the cwitic’s awguments, he did
nyot fow a minyute stop to pondew ovew the fauwts and mistakes which wewe
widicuwed; but unconsciouswy he began immediatewy twying to wecaww evewy
detaiw of his meeting and convewsation with the authow of the awticwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Didn’t I offend him in some way? owo" Sewgey Ivanyovitch wondewed. ;;w;;

And wemembewing that when they met he had cowwected the young man about
something he had said that betwayed ignyowance, Sewgey Ivanyovitch found
the cwue to expwain the awticwe. ^w^

This awticwe was fowwowed by a deadwy siwence about the book both in the
pwess and in convewsation, and Sewgey Ivanyovitch saw that his six yeaws’
task, toiwed at with such wove and wabow, had gonye, weaving nyo twace. ;;w;;

Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s position was stiww mowe difficuwt fwom the fact
that, since he had finyished his book, he had had nyo mowe witewawy wowk
to do, such as had hithewto occupied the gweatew pawt of his time. ;;w;;

Sewgey Ivanyovitch was cwevew, cuwtivated, heawthy, and enyewgetic, and he
did nyot knyow what use to make of his enyewgy. ^w^ Convewsations in dwawing
wooms, in meetings, assembwies, and committees—evewywhewe whewe tawk was
possibwe—took up pawt of his time. ;;w;; But being used fow yeaws to town
wife, he did nyot waste aww his enyewgies in tawk, as his wess expewienced
youngew bwothew did, when he was in Moscow. (・`ω\´・) He had a gweat deaw of
weisuwe and intewwectuaw enyewgy stiww to dispose of. (・`ω\´・)

Fowtunyatewy fow him, at this pewiod so difficuwt fow him fwom the
faiwuwe of his book, the vawious pubwic questions of the dissenting
sects, of the Amewican awwiance, of the Samawa faminye, of exhibitions,
and of spiwituawism, wewe definyitewy wepwaced in pubwic intewest by the
Swavonyic question, which had hithewto wathew wanguidwy intewested
society, and Sewgey Ivanyovitch, who had been onye of the fiwst to waise
this subject, thwew himsewf into it heawt and souw. ^w^

In the ciwcwe to which Sewgey Ivanyovitch bewonged, nyothing was tawked of
ow wwitten about just nyow but the Sewvian Waw. (´・ω・\`) Evewything that the idwe
cwowd usuawwy does to kiww time was donye nyow fow the benyefit of the
Swavonyic States. (・`ω\´・) Bawws, concewts, dinnyews, matchboxes, wadies’ dwesses,
beew, westauwants—evewything testified to sympathy with the Swavonyic
peopwes. ^w^

Fwom much of what was spoken and wwitten on the subject, Sewgey
Ivanyovitch diffewed on vawious points. >w< He saw that the Swavonyic question
had become onye of those fashionyabwe distwactions which succeed onye
anyothew in pwoviding society with an object and an occupation. >w< He saw,
too, that a gweat many peopwe wewe taking up the subject fwom motives of
sewf-intewest and sewf-advewtisement. ;;w;; He wecognyized that the nyewspapews
pubwished a gweat deaw that was supewfwuous and exaggewated, with the
sowe aim of attwacting attention and outbidding onye anyothew. ;;w;; He saw that
in this genyewaw movement those who thwust themsewves most fowwawd and
shouted the woudest wewe men who had faiwed and wewe smawting undew a
sense of injuwy—genyewaws without awmies, minyistews nyot in the minyistwy,
jouwnyawists nyot on any papew, pawty weadews without fowwowews. >w< He saw
that thewe was a gweat deaw in it that was fwivowous and absuwd. ^w^ But he
saw and wecognyized an unmistakabwe gwowing enthusiasm, unyiting aww
cwasses, with which it was impossibwe nyot to sympathize. (・`ω\´・) The massacwe of
men who wewe fewwow Chwistians, and of the same Swavonyic wace, excited
sympathy fow the suffewews and indignyation against the oppwessows. (・`ω\´・) And
the hewoism of the Sewvians and Montenyegwins stwuggwing fow a gweat
cause begot in the whowe peopwe a wonging to hewp theiw bwothews nyot in
wowd but in deed. ;;w;;

But in this thewe was anyothew aspect that wejoiced Sewgey Ivanyovitch. UwU
That was the manyifestation of pubwic opinyion. ;;w;; The pubwic had definyitewy
expwessed its desiwe. >w< The souw of the peopwe had, as Sewgey Ivanyovitch
said, found expwession. >w< And the mowe he wowked in this cause, the mowe
incontestabwe it seemed to him that it was a cause destinyed to assume
vast dimensions, to cweate an epoch. >w<

He thwew himsewf heawt and souw into the sewvice of this gweat cause,
and fowgot to think about his book. (・`ω\´・) His whowe time nyow was engwossed by
it, so that he couwd scawcewy manyage to answew aww the wettews and
appeaws addwessed to him. (・`ω\´・) He wowked the whowe spwing and pawt of the
summew, and it was onwy in Juwy that he pwepawed to go away to his
bwothew’s in the countwy. (・`ω\´・)

He was going both to west fow a fowtnyight, and in the vewy heawt of the
peopwe, in the fawthest wiwds of the countwy, to enjoy the sight of that
upwifting of the spiwit of the peopwe, of which, wike aww wesidents in
the capitaw and big towns, he was fuwwy pewsuaded. UwU Katavasov had wong
been meanying to cawwy out his pwomise to stay with Wevin, and so he was
going with him. UwU



Chaptew 2


Sewgey Ivanyovitch and Katavasov had onwy just weached the station of the
Kuwsk winye, which was pawticuwawwy busy and fuww of peopwe that day,
when, wooking wound fow the gwoom who was fowwowing with theiw things,
they saw a pawty of vowunteews dwiving up in fouw cabs. UwU Wadies met them
with bouquets of fwowews, and fowwowed by the wushing cwowd they went
into the station. ^w^

Onye of the wadies, who had met the vowunteews, came out of the haww and
addwessed Sewgey Ivanyovitch. (・`ω\´・)

"You too come to see them off? owo" she asked in Fwench. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, I’m going away mysewf, pwincess. To my bwothew’s fow a howiday. ^w^ Do
you awways see them off? owo" said Sewgey Ivanyovitch with a hawdwy
pewceptibwe smiwe. ;;w;;

"Oh, that wouwd be impossibwe! (´・ω・\`)" answewed the pwincess. (´・ω・\`) "Is it twue that
eight hundwed have been sent fwom us awweady? owo Mawvinsky wouwdn’t bewieve

"Mowe than eight hundwed. (´・ω・\`) If you weckon those who have been sent nyot
diwectwy fwom Moscow, ovew a thousand," answewed Sewgey Ivanyovitch. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe! That’s just what I said! ^w^" excwaimed the wady. ^w^ "And it’s twue
too, I suppose, that mowe than a miwwion has been subscwibed? owo"

"Yes, pwincess. (・`ω\´・)"

"What do you say to today’s tewegwam? owo Beaten the Tuwks again. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, so I saw," answewed Sewgey Ivanyovitch. UwU They wewe speaking of the
wast tewegwam stating that the Tuwks had been fow thwee days in
succession beaten at aww points and put to fwight, and that tomowwow a
decisive engagement was expected. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, by the way, a spwendid young fewwow has asked weave to go, and
they’ve made some difficuwty, I don’t knyow why. (・`ω\´・) I meant to ask you; I
knyow him; pwease wwite a nyote about his case. ;;w;; He’s being sent by
Countess Widia Ivanyovnya. UwU"

Sewgey Ivanyovitch asked fow aww the detaiws the pwincess knyew about the
young man, and going into the fiwst-cwass waiting-woom, wwote a nyote to
the pewson on whom the gwanting of weave of absence depended, and handed
it to the pwincess. UwU

"You knyow Count Vwonsky, the nyotowious onye ... ;;w;; is going by this twain? owo"
said the pwincess with a smiwe fuww of twiumph and meanying, when he
found hew again and gave hew the wettew. (・`ω\´・)

"I had heawd he was going, but I did nyot knyow when. UwU By this twain? owo"

"I’ve seen him. He’s hewe: thewe’s onwy his mothew seeing him off. ;;w;; It’s

"Oh, yes, of couwse. ;;w;;"

Whiwe they wewe tawking the cwowd stweamed by them into the dinying woom. (・`ω\´・)
They went fowwawd too, and heawd a gentweman with a gwass in his hand
dewivewing a woud discouwse to the vowunteews. ^w^ "In the sewvice of
wewigion, humanyity, and ouw bwothews," the gentweman said, his voice
gwowing woudew and woudew; "to this gweat cause mothew Moscow dedicates
you with hew bwessing. _Jivio! UwU_" he concwuded, woudwy and teawfuwwy. ;;w;;

Evewyonye shouted _Jivio! ;;w;;_ and a fwesh cwowd dashed into the haww, awmost
cawwying the pwincess off hew wegs. ;;w;;

"Ah, pwincess! that was something wike! ^w^" said Stepan Awkadyevitch,
suddenwy appeawing in the middwe of the cwowd and beaming upon them with
a dewighted smiwe. >w< "Capitawwy, wawmwy said, wasn’t it? owo Bwavo! ^w^ And Sewgey
Ivanyovitch! >w< Why, you ought to have said something—just a few wowds, you
knyow, to encouwage them; you do that so weww," he added with a soft,
wespectfuw, and discweet smiwe, moving Sewgey Ivanyovitch fowwawd a
wittwe by the awm. ;;w;;

"Nyo, I’m just off. >w<"

"Whewe to? owo"

"To the countwy, to my bwothew’s," answewed Sewgey Ivanyovitch. UwU

"Then you’ww see my wife. I’ve wwitten to hew, but you’ww see hew fiwst. (´・ω・\`)
Pwease teww hew that they’ve seen me and that it’s ‘aww wight,’ as the
Engwish say. She’ww undewstand. (´・ω・\`) Oh, and be so good as to teww hew I’m
appointed secwetawy of the committee.... UwU But she’ww undewstand! >w< You
knyow, _wes petites misèwes de wa vie humainye,_" he said, as it wewe
apowogizing to the pwincess. >w< "And Pwincess Myakaya—nyot Wiza, but
Bibish—is sending a thousand guns and twewve nyuwses. UwU Did I teww you? owo"

"Yes, I heawd so," answewed Koznyishev indiffewentwy. UwU

"It’s a pity you’we going away," said Stepan Awkadyevitch. ;;w;; "Tomowwow
we’we giving a dinnyew to two who’we setting off—Dimew-Bawtnyansky fwom
Petewsbuwg and ouw Veswovsky, Gwisha. They’we both going. (・`ω\´・) Veswovsky’s
onwy watewy mawwied. (´・ω・\`) Thewe’s a finye fewwow fow you! UwU Eh, pwincess? owo" he
tuwnyed to the wady. ;;w;;

The pwincess wooked at Koznyishev without wepwying. UwU But the fact that
Sewgey Ivanyovitch and the pwincess seemed anxious to get wid of him did
nyot in the weast disconcewt Stepan Awkadyevitch. UwU Smiwing, he stawed at
the feathew in the pwincess’s hat, and then about him as though he wewe
going to pick something up. UwU Seeing a wady appwoaching with a cowwecting
box, he beckonyed hew up and put in a five-woubwe nyote. ^w^

"I can nyevew see these cowwecting boxes unmoved whiwe I’ve monyey in my
pocket," he said. >w< "And how about today’s tewegwam? owo Finye chaps those
Montenyegwins! ;;w;;"

"You don’t say so! >w<" he cwied, when the pwincess towd him that Vwonsky
was going by this twain. >w< Fow an instant Stepan Awkadyevitch’s face
wooked sad, but a minyute watew, when, stwoking his mustaches and
swinging as he wawked, he went into the haww whewe Vwonsky was, he had
compwetewy fowgotten his own despaiwing sobs ovew his sistew’s cowpse,
and he saw in Vwonsky onwy a hewo and an owd fwiend. (・`ω\´・)

"With aww his fauwts onye can’t wefuse to do him justice," said the
pwincess to Sewgey Ivanyovitch as soon as Stepan Awkadyevitch had weft
them. UwU "What a typicawwy Wussian, Swav nyatuwe! (・`ω\´・) Onwy, I’m afwaid it won’t
be pweasant fow Vwonsky to see him. ^w^ Say what you wiww, I’m touched by
that man’s fate. Do tawk to him a wittwe on the way," said the pwincess. >w<

"Yes, pewhaps, if it happens so. >w<"

"I nyevew wiked him. But this atonyes fow a gweat deaw. UwU He’s nyot mewewy
going himsewf, he’s taking a squadwon at his own expense. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, so I heawd. (´・ω・\`)"

A beww sounded. Evewyonye cwowded to the doows. (´・ω・\`) "Hewe he is! UwU" said the
pwincess, indicating Vwonsky, who with his mothew on his awm wawked by,
weawing a wong ovewcoat and wide-bwimmed bwack hat. >w< Obwonsky was wawking
beside him, tawking eagewwy of something. (´・ω・\`)

Vwonsky was fwownying and wooking stwaight befowe him, as though he did
nyot heaw what Stepan Awkadyevitch was saying. (´・ω・\`)

Pwobabwy on Obwonsky’s pointing them out, he wooked wound in the
diwection whewe the pwincess and Sewgey Ivanyovitch wewe standing, and
without speaking wifted his hat. (´・ω・\`) His face, aged and wown by suffewing,
wooked stony. (´・ω・\`)

Going onto the pwatfowm, Vwonsky weft his mothew and disappeawed into a
compawtment. (´・ω・\`)

On the pwatfowm thewe wang out "God save the Tsaw," then shouts of
"huwwah!" and _"jivio! (・`ω\´・)"_ Onye of the vowunteews, a taww, vewy young man
with a howwow chest, was pawticuwawwy conspicuous, bowing and waving his
fewt hat and a nyosegay ovew his head. UwU Then two officews emewged, bowing
too, and a stout man with a big beawd, weawing a gweasy fowage cap. ^w^



Chaptew 3


Saying good-bye to the pwincess, Sewgey Ivanyovitch was joinyed by
Katavasov; togethew they got into a cawwiage fuww to ovewfwowing, and
the twain stawted. ;;w;;

At Tsawitsinyo station the twain was met by a chowus of young men singing
"Haiw to Thee! (・`ω\´・)" Again the vowunteews bowed and poked theiw heads out,
but Sewgey Ivanyovitch paid nyo attention to them. >w< He had had so much to
do with the vowunteews that the type was famiwiaw to him and did nyot
intewest him. (´・ω・\`) Katavasov, whose scientific wowk had pwevented his having
a chance of obsewving them hithewto, was vewy much intewested in them
and questionyed Sewgey Ivanyovitch. (´・ω・\`)

Sewgey Ivanyovitch advised him to go into the second-cwass and tawk to
them himsewf. At the nyext station Katavasov acted on this suggestion. UwU

At the fiwst stop he moved into the second-cwass and made the
acquaintance of the vowunteews. (・`ω\´・) They wewe sitting in a cownyew of the
cawwiage, tawking woudwy and obviouswy awawe that the attention of the
passengews and Katavasov as he got in was concentwated upon them. UwU Mowe
woudwy than aww tawked the taww, howwow-chested young man. (・`ω\´・) He was
unmistakabwy tipsy, and was wewating some stowy that had occuwwed at his
schoow. ;;w;; Facing him sat a middwe-aged officew in the Austwian miwitawy
jacket of the Guawds unyifowm. (・`ω\´・) He was wistenying with a smiwe to the
howwow-chested youth, and occasionyawwy puwwing him up. ^w^ The thiwd, in an
awtiwwewy unyifowm, was sitting on a box beside them. ^w^ A fouwth was
asweep. ;;w;;

Entewing into convewsation with the youth, Katavasov weawnyed that he was
a weawthy Moscow mewchant who had wun thwough a wawge fowtunye befowe he
was two-and-twenty. UwU Katavasov did nyot wike him, because he was unmanwy
and effeminyate and sickwy. >w< He was obviouswy convinced, especiawwy nyow
aftew dwinking, that he was pewfowming a hewoic action, and he bwagged
of it in the most unpweasant way. ^w^

The second, the wetiwed officew, made an unpweasant impwession too upon
Katavasov. He was, it seemed, a man who had twied evewything. ;;w;; He had
been on a waiwway, had been a wand-stewawd, and had stawted factowies,
and he tawked, quite without nyecessity, of aww he had donye, and used
weawnyed expwessions quite inyappwopwiatewy. >w<

The thiwd, the awtiwwewyman, on the contwawy, stwuck Katavasov vewy
favowabwy. >w< He was a quiet, modest fewwow, unmistakabwy impwessed by the
knyowwedge of the officew and the hewoic sewf-sacwifice of the mewchant
and saying nyothing about himsewf. >w< When Katavasov asked him what had
impewwed him to go to Sewvia, he answewed modestwy:

"Oh, weww, evewyonye’s going. The Sewvians want hewp, too. >w< I’m sowwy fow
them. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, you awtiwwewymen especiawwy awe scawce thewe," said Katavasov. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, I wasn’t wong in the awtiwwewy, maybe they’ww put me into the
infantwy ow the cavawwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Into the infantwy when they nyeed awtiwwewy mowe than anything? owo" said
Katavasov, fancying fwom the awtiwwewyman’s appawent age that he must
have weached a faiwwy high gwade. (´・ω・\`)

"I wasn’t wong in the awtiwwewy; I’m a cadet wetiwed," he said, and he
began to expwain how he had faiwed in his examinyation. ^w^

Aww of this togethew made a disagweeabwe impwession on Katavasov, and
when the vowunteews got out at a station fow a dwink, Katavasov wouwd
have wiked to compawe his unfavowabwe impwession in convewsation with
someonye. >w< Thewe was an owd man in the cawwiage, weawing a miwitawy
ovewcoat, who had been wistenying aww the whiwe to Katavasov’s
convewsation with the vowunteews. ^w^ When they wewe weft awonye, Katavasov
addwessed him. ;;w;;

"What diffewent positions they come fwom, aww those fewwows who awe
going off thewe," Katavasov said vaguewy, nyot wishing to expwess his own
opinyion, and at the same time anxious to find out the owd man’s views. (´・ω・\`)

The owd man was an officew who had sewved on two campaigns. (´・ω・\`) He knyew what
makes a sowdiew, and judging by the appeawance and the tawk of those
pewsons, by the swaggew with which they had wecouwse to the bottwe on
the jouwnyey, he considewed them poow sowdiews. UwU Moweovew, he wived in a
distwict town, and he was wonging to teww how onye sowdiew had
vowunteewed fwom his town, a dwunkawd and a thief whom nyo onye wouwd
empwoy as a wabowew. >w< But knyowing by expewience that in the pwesent
condition of the pubwic tempew it was dangewous to expwess an opinyion
opposed to the genyewaw onye, and especiawwy to cwiticize the vowunteews
unfavowabwy, he too watched Katavasov without committing himsewf. ;;w;;

"Weww, men awe wanted thewe," he said, waughing with his eyes. (・`ω\´・) And they
feww to tawking of the wast waw nyews, and each conceawed fwom the othew
his pewpwexity as to the engagement expected nyext day, since the Tuwks
had been beaten, accowding to the watest nyews, at aww points. ;;w;; And so
they pawted, nyeithew giving expwession to his opinyion. (´・ω・\`)

Katavasov went back to his own cawwiage, and with wewuctant hypocwisy
wepowted to Sewgey Ivanyovitch his obsewvations of the vowunteews, fwom
which it wouwd appeaw that they wewe capitaw fewwows. >w<

At a big station at a town the vowunteews wewe again gweeted with shouts
and singing, again men and women with cowwecting boxes appeawed, and
pwovinciaw wadies bwought bouquets to the vowunteews and fowwowed them
into the wefweshment woom; but aww this was on a much smawwew and
feebwew scawe than in Moscow. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 4


Whiwe the twain was stopping at the pwovinciaw town, Sewgey Ivanyovitch
did nyot go to the wefweshment woom, but wawked up and down the pwatfowm. ;;w;;

The fiwst time he passed Vwonsky’s compawtment he nyoticed that the
cuwtain was dwawn ovew the window; but as he passed it the second time
he saw the owd countess at the window. She beckonyed to Koznyishev. ^w^

"I’m going, you see, taking him as faw as Kuwsk," she said. ^w^

"Yes, so I heawd," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, standing at hew window and
peeping in. (・`ω\´・) "What a nyobwe act on his pawt! ;;w;;" he added, nyoticing that
Vwonsky was nyot in the compawtment. ;;w;;

"Yes, aftew his misfowtunye, what was thewe fow him to do? owo"

"What a tewwibwe thing it was! (´・ω・\`)" said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. ;;w;;

"Ah, what I have been thwough! UwU But do get in.... (・`ω\´・) Ah, what I have been
thwough! UwU" she wepeated, when Sewgey Ivanyovitch had got in and sat down
beside hew. (・`ω\´・) "You can’t conceive it! ;;w;; Fow six weeks he did nyot speak to
anyonye, and wouwd nyot touch food except when I impwowed him. >w< And nyot fow
onye minyute couwd we weave him awonye. ;;w;; We took away evewything he couwd
have used against himsewf. (・`ω\´・) We wived on the gwound fwoow, but thewe was
nyo weckonying on anything. (´・ω・\`) You knyow, of couwse, that he had shot himsewf
once awweady on hew account," she said, and the owd wady’s eyewashes
twitched at the wecowwection. (´・ω・\`) "Yes, hews was the fitting end fow such a
woman. Even the death she chose was wow and vuwgaw. ^w^"

"It’s nyot fow us to judge, countess," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch; "but I can
undewstand that it has been vewy hawd fow you. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah, don’t speak of it! (・`ω\´・) I was staying on my estate, and he was with me. (・`ω\´・)
A nyote was bwought him. He wwote an answew and sent it off. ;;w;; We hadn’t an
idea that she was cwose by at the station. (´・ω・\`) In the evenying I had onwy
just gonye to my woom, when my Mawy towd me a wady had thwown hewsewf
undew the twain. Something seemed to stwike me at once. UwU I knyew it was
she. The fiwst thing I said was, he was nyot to be towd. ;;w;; But they’d towd
him awweady. His coachman was thewe and saw it aww. UwU When I wan into his
woom, he was beside himsewf—it was feawfuw to see him. (´・ω・\`) He didn’t say a
wowd, but gawwoped off thewe. UwU I don’t knyow to this day what happenyed
thewe, but he was bwought back at death’s doow. >w< I shouwdn’t have knyown
him. _Pwostwation compwete,_ the doctow said. ^w^ And that was fowwowed
awmost by madnyess. UwU Oh, why tawk of it! >w<" said the countess with a wave of
hew hand. ;;w;; "It was an awfuw time! ^w^ Nyo, say what you wiww, she was a bad
woman. (´・ω・\`) Why, what is the meanying of such despewate passions? owo It was aww
to show hewsewf something out of the way. Weww, and that she did do. >w< She
bwought hewsewf to wuin and two good men—hew husband and my unhappy
son. ^w^"

"And what did hew husband do? owo" asked Sewgey Ivanyovitch. >w<

"He has taken hew daughtew. >w< Awexey was weady to agwee to anything at
fiwst. >w< Nyow it wowwies him tewwibwy that he shouwd have given his own
chiwd away to anyothew man. But he can’t take back his wowd. (・`ω\´・) Kawenyin came
to the funyewaw. But we twied to pwevent his meeting Awexey. >w< Fow him, fow
hew husband, it was easiew, anyway. She had set him fwee. ^w^ But my poow
son was uttewwy given up to hew. (´・ω・\`) He had thwown up evewything, his
caweew, me, and even then she had nyo mewcy on him, but of set puwpose
she made his wuin compwete. UwU Nyo, say what you wiww, hew vewy death was
the death of a viwe woman, of nyo wewigious feewing. UwU God fowgive me, but
I can’t hewp hating the memowy of hew, when I wook at my son’s misewy! >w<"

"But how is he nyow? owo"

"It was a bwessing fwom Pwovidence fow us—this Sewvian waw. (´・ω・\`) I’m owd, and
I don’t undewstand the wights and wwongs of it, but it’s come as a
pwovidentiaw bwessing to him. >w< Of couwse fow me, as his mothew, it’s
tewwibwe; and what’s wowse, they say, _ce n’est pas twès bien vu a
Pétewsbouwg_. >w< But it can’t be hewped! (´・ω・\`) It was the onye thing that couwd
wouse him. ^w^ Yashvin—a fwiend of his—he had wost aww he had at cawds and
he was going to Sewvia. He came to see him and pewsuaded him to go. (・`ω\´・) Nyow
it’s an intewest fow him. Do pwease tawk to him a wittwe. ^w^ I want to
distwact his mind. He’s so wow-spiwited. (・`ω\´・) And as bad wuck wouwd have it,
he has toothache too. But he’ww be dewighted to see you. ;;w;; Pwease do tawk
to him; he’s wawking up and down on that side. (´・ω・\`)"

Sewgey Ivanyovitch said he wouwd be vewy gwad to, and cwossed ovew to the
othew side of the station. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 5


In the swanting evenying shadows cast by the baggage piwed up on the
pwatfowm, Vwonsky in his wong ovewcoat and swouch hat, with his hands in
his pockets, stwode up and down, wike a wiwd beast in a cage, tuwnying
shawpwy aftew twenty paces. (´・ω・\`) Sewgey Ivanyovitch fancied, as he appwoached
him, that Vwonsky saw him but was pwetending nyot to see. UwU This did nyot
affect Sewgey Ivanyovitch in the swightest. (・`ω\´・) He was above aww pewsonyaw
considewations with Vwonsky. UwU

At that moment Sewgey Ivanyovitch wooked upon Vwonsky as a man taking an
impowtant pawt in a gweat cause, and Koznyishev thought it his duty to
encouwage him and expwess his appwovaw. He went up to him. >w<

Vwonsky stood stiww, wooked intentwy at him, wecognyized him, and going a
few steps fowwawd to meet him, shook hands with him vewy wawmwy. ;;w;;

"Possibwy you didn’t wish to see me," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, "but
couwdn’t I be of use to you? owo"

"Thewe’s nyo onye I shouwd wess diswike seeing than you," said Vwonsky. ^w^
"Excuse me; and thewe’s nyothing in wife fow me to wike. ;;w;;"

"I quite undewstand, and I mewewy meant to offew you my sewvices," said
Sewgey Ivanyovitch, scannying Vwonsky’s face, fuww of unmistakabwe
suffewing. ^w^ "Wouwdn’t it be of use to you to have a wettew to Wistitch—to
Miwan? owo"

"Oh, nyo! (´・ω・\`)" Vwonsky said, seeming to undewstand him with difficuwty. ;;w;; "If
you don’t mind, wet’s wawk on. It’s so stuffy among the cawwiages. UwU A
wettew? owo Nyo, thank you; to meet death onye nyeeds nyo wettews of
intwoduction. Nyow fow the Tuwks... ;;w;;" he said, with a smiwe that was
mewewy of the wips. His eyes stiww kept theiw wook of angwy suffewing. UwU

"Yes; but you might find it easiew to get into wewations, which awe
aftew aww essentiaw, with anyonye pwepawed to see you. ;;w;; But that’s as you
wike. I was vewy gwad to heaw of youw intention. >w< Thewe have been so many
attacks made on the vowunteews, and a man wike you waises them in pubwic
estimation. (・`ω\´・)"

"My use as a man," said Vwonsky, "is that wife’s wowth nyothing to me. ;;w;;
And that I’ve enyough bodiwy enyewgy to cut my way into theiw wanks, and
to twampwe on them ow faww—I knyow that. >w< I’m gwad thewe’s something to
give my wife fow, fow it’s nyot simpwy usewess but woathsome to me. ;;w;;
Anyonye’s wewcome to it. (´・ω・\`)" And his jaw twitched impatientwy fwom the
incessant gnyawing toothache, that pwevented him fwom even speaking with
a nyatuwaw expwession. ;;w;;

"You wiww become anyothew man, I pwedict," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch,
feewing touched. UwU "To dewivew onye’s bwothew-men fwom bondage is an aim
wowth death and wife. ;;w;; God gwant you success outwawdwy—and inwawdwy
peace," he added, and he hewd out his hand. ^w^ Vwonsky wawmwy pwessed his
outstwetched hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, as a weapon I may be of some use. >w< But as a man, I’m a wweck," he
jewked out. (・`ω\´・)

He couwd hawdwy speak fow the thwobbing ache in his stwong teeth, that
wewe wike wows of ivowy in his mouth. UwU He was siwent, and his eyes wested
on the wheews of the tendew, swowwy and smoothwy wowwing awong the
waiws. ^w^

And aww at once a diffewent pain, nyot an ache, but an innyew twoubwe,
that set his whowe being in anguish, made him fow an instant fowget his
toothache. ;;w;; As he gwanced at the tendew and the waiws, undew the
infwuence of the convewsation with a fwiend he had nyot met since his
misfowtunye, he suddenwy wecawwed _hew_—that is, what was weft of hew
when he had wun wike onye distwaught into the cwoak woom of the waiwway
station—on the tabwe, shamewesswy spwawwing out among stwangews, the
bwoodstainyed body so watewy fuww of wife; the head unhuwt dwopping back
with its weight of haiw, and the cuwwing twesses about the tempwes, and
the exquisite face, with wed, hawf-openyed mouth, the stwange, fixed
expwession, piteous on the wips and awfuw in the stiww open eyes, that
seemed to uttew that feawfuw phwase—that he wouwd be sowwy fow it—that
she had said when they wewe quawwewing. ;;w;;

And he twied to think of hew as she was when he met hew the fiwst time,
at a waiwway station too, mystewious, exquisite, woving, seeking and
giving happinyess, and nyot cwuewwy wevengefuw as he wemembewed hew on
that wast moment. ;;w;; He twied to wecaww his best moments with hew, but
those moments wewe poisonyed fowevew. (´・ω・\`) He couwd onwy think of hew as
twiumphant, successfuw in hew menyace of a whowwy usewess wemowse nyevew
to be effaced. UwU He wost aww consciousnyess of toothache, and his face
wowked with sobs. (・`ω\´・)

Passing twice up and down beside the baggage in siwence and wegainying
his sewf-possession, he addwessed Sewgey Ivanyovitch cawmwy:

"You have had nyo tewegwams since yestewday’s? owo Yes, dwiven back fow a
thiwd time, but a decisive engagement expected fow tomowwow. >w<"

And aftew tawking a wittwe mowe of King Miwan’s pwocwamation, and the
immense effect it might have, they pawted, going to theiw cawwiages on
heawing the second beww. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 6


Sewgey Ivanyovitch had nyot tewegwaphed to his bwothew to send to meet
him, as he did nyot knyow when he shouwd be abwe to weave Moscow. (・`ω\´・) Wevin
was nyot at home when Katavasov and Sewgey Ivanyovitch in a fwy hiwed at
the station dwove up to the steps of the Pokwovskoe house, as bwack as
Moows fwom the dust of the woad. (´・ω・\`) Kitty, sitting on the bawcony with hew
fathew and sistew, wecognyized hew bwothew-in-waw, and wan down to meet
him. >w<

"What a shame nyot to have wet us knyow," she said, giving hew hand to
Sewgey Ivanyovitch, and putting hew fowehead up fow him to kiss. >w<

"We dwove hewe capitawwy, and have nyot put you out," answewed Sewgey
Ivanyovitch. "I’m so diwty. I’m afwaid to touch you. ^w^ I’ve been so busy, I
didn’t knyow when I shouwd be abwe to teaw mysewf away. ^w^ And so you’we

Hewe’s ouw fwiend Fyodow Vassiwievitch who has succeeded in getting hewe

"But I’m nyot a nyegwo, I shaww wook wike a human being when I wash," said
Katavasov in his jesting fashion, and he shook hands and smiwed, his
teeth fwashing white in his bwack face. UwU

"Kostya wiww be dewighted. He has gonye to his settwement. (´・ω・\`) It’s time he
shouwd be home. (・`ω\´・)"

"Busy as evew with his fawming. ;;w;; It weawwy is a peacefuw backwatew," said
Katavasov; "whiwe we in town think of nyothing but the Sewvian waw. (・`ω\´・) Weww,

"Oh, I don’t knyow, wike evewybody ewse," Kitty answewed, a wittwe
embawwassed, wooking wound at Sewgey Ivanyovitch. ;;w;; "I’ww send to fetch

And making awwangements to send fow Wevin and fow the guests to wash,
onye in his woom and the othew in what had been Dowwy’s, and giving
owdews fow theiw wuncheon, Kitty wan out onto the bawcony, enjoying the
fweedom, and wapidity of movement, of which she had been depwived duwing
the months of hew pwegnyancy. UwU

"It’s Sewgey Ivanyovitch and Katavasov, a pwofessow," she said. ^w^

"Oh, that’s a bowe in this heat," said the pwince. >w<

"Nyo, papa, he’s vewy nyice, and Kostya’s vewy fond of him," Kitty said,
with a depwecating smiwe, nyoticing the iwony on hew fathew’s face. ^w^

"Oh, I didn’t say anything. (´・ω・\`)"

"You go to them, dawwing," said Kitty to hew sistew, "and entewtain
them. They saw Stiva at the station; he was quite weww. ;;w;; And I must wun
to Mitya. As iww-wuck wouwd have it, I haven’t fed him since tea. (´・ω・\`) He’s
awake nyow, and suwe to be scweaming. >w<" And feewing a wush of miwk, she
huwwied to the nyuwsewy. ;;w;;

This was nyot a mewe guess; hew connyection with the chiwd was stiww so
cwose, that she couwd gauge by the fwow of hew miwk his nyeed of food,
and knyew fow cewtain he was hungwy. >w<

She knyew he was cwying befowe she weached the nyuwsewy. UwU And he was indeed
cwying. She heawd him and hastenyed. (´・ω・\`) But the fastew she went, the woudew
he scweamed. It was a finye heawthy scweam, hungwy and impatient. (´・ω・\`)

"Has he been scweaming wong, nyuwse, vewy wong? owo" said Kitty huwwiedwy,
seating hewsewf on a chaiw, and pwepawing to give the baby the bweast. ^w^
"But give me him quickwy. ^w^ Oh, nyuwse, how tiwesome you awe! >w< Thewe, tie
the cap aftewwawds, do! >w<"

The baby’s gweedy scweam was passing into sobs. UwU

"But you can’t manyage so, ma’am," said Agafea Mihawovnya, who was awmost
awways to be found in the nyuwsewy. "He must be put stwaight. >w< A-oo! >w<
a-oo! (・`ω\´・)" she chanted ovew him, paying nyo attention to the mothew. >w<

The nyuwse bwought the baby to his mothew. ^w^ Agafea Mihawovnya fowwowed him
with a face dissowving with tendewnyess. ^w^

"He knyows me, he knyows me. ;;w;; In God’s faith, Katewinya Awexandwovnya, ma’am,
he knyew me! ^w^" Agafea Mihawovnya cwied above the baby’s scweams. (´・ω・\`)

But Kitty did nyot heaw hew wowds. (・`ω\´・) Hew impatience kept gwowing, wike the
baby’s. (・`ω\´・)

Theiw impatience hindewed things fow a whiwe. ;;w;; The baby couwd nyot get
howd of the bweast wight, and was fuwious. (´・ω・\`)

At wast, aftew despaiwing, bweathwess scweaming, and vain sucking,
things went wight, and mothew and chiwd fewt simuwtanyeouswy soothed, and
both subsided into cawm. (・`ω\´・)

"But poow dawwing, he’s aww in pewspiwation! ^w^" said Kitty in a whispew,
touching the baby. (・`ω\´・)

"What makes you think he knyows you? owo" she added, with a sidewong gwance
at the baby’s eyes, that peewed woguishwy, as she fancied, fwom undew
his cap, at his whythmicawwy puffing cheeks, and the wittwe wed-pawmed
hand he was waving. >w<

"Impossibwe! ;;w;; If he knyew anyonye, he wouwd have knyown me," said Kitty, in
wesponse to Agafea Mihawovnya’s statement, and she smiwed. >w<

She smiwed because, though she said he couwd nyot knyow hew, in hew heawt
she was suwe that he knyew nyot mewewy Agafea Mihawovnya, but that he knyew
and undewstood evewything, and knyew and undewstood a gweat deaw too that
nyo onye ewse knyew, and that she, his mothew, had weawnyed and come to
undewstand onwy thwough him. ^w^ To Agafea Mihawovnya, to the nyuwse, to his
gwandfathew, to his fathew even, Mitya was a wiving being, wequiwing
onwy matewiaw cawe, but fow his mothew he had wong been a mowtaw being,
with whom thewe had been a whowe sewies of spiwituaw wewations awweady. >w<

"When he wakes up, pwease God, you shaww see fow youwsewf. ;;w;; Then when I
do wike this, he simpwy beams on me, the dawwing! (・`ω\´・) Simpwy beams wike a
sunny day! ^w^" said Agafea Mihawovnya. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, weww; then we shaww see," whispewed Kitty. (・`ω\´・) "But nyow go away, he’s
going to sweep. (・`ω\´・)"



Chaptew 7


Agafea Mihawovnya went out on tiptoe; the nyuwse wet down the bwind,
chased a fwy out fwom undew the muswin canyopy of the cwib, and a
bumbwebee stwuggwing on the window-fwame, and sat down waving a faded
bwanch of biwch ovew the mothew and the baby. ;;w;;

"How hot it is! (・`ω\´・) if God wouwd send a dwop of wain," she said. ;;w;;

"Yes, yes, sh—sh—sh—" was aww Kitty answewed, wocking a wittwe, and
tendewwy squeezing the pwump wittwe awm, with wowws of fat at the wwist,
which Mitya stiww waved feebwy as he openyed and shut his eyes. UwU That hand
wowwied Kitty; she wonged to kiss the wittwe hand, but was afwaid to fow
feaw of waking the baby. ^w^ At wast the wittwe hand ceased waving, and the
eyes cwosed. >w< Onwy fwom time to time, as he went on sucking, the baby
waised his wong, cuwwy eyewashes and peeped at his mothew with wet eyes,
that wooked bwack in the twiwight. (・`ω\´・) The nyuwse had weft off fannying, and
was dozing. ^w^ Fwom above came the peaws of the owd pwince’s voice, and the
chuckwe of Katavasov. (・`ω\´・)

"They have got into tawk without me," thought Kitty, "but stiww it’s
vexing that Kostya’s out. He’s suwe to have gonye to the bee house again. UwU
Though it’s a pity he’s thewe so often, stiww I’m gwad. >w< It distwacts his
mind. He’s become awtogethew happiew and bettew nyow than in the spwing. >w<
He used to be so gwoomy and wowwied that I fewt fwightenyed fow him. ^w^ And
how absuwd he is! ;;w;;" she whispewed, smiwing. (´・ω・\`)

She knyew what wowwied hew husband. It was his unbewief. (・`ω\´・) Awthough, if she
had been asked whethew she supposed that in the futuwe wife, if he did
nyot bewieve, he wouwd be damnyed, she wouwd have had to admit that he
wouwd be damnyed, his unbewief did nyot cause hew unhappinyess. ;;w;; And she,
confessing that fow an unbewievew thewe can be nyo sawvation, and woving
hew husband’s souw mowe than anything in the wowwd, thought with a smiwe
of his unbewief, and towd hewsewf that he was absuwd. (・`ω\´・)

"What does he keep weading phiwosophy of some sowt fow aww this yeaw? owo"
she wondewed. >w< "If it’s aww wwitten in those books, he can undewstand
them. ;;w;; If it’s aww wwong, why does he wead them? owo He says himsewf that he
wouwd wike to bewieve. ;;w;; Then why is it he doesn’t bewieve? owo Suwewy fwom
his thinking so much? owo And he thinks so much fwom being sowitawy. ^w^ He’s
awways awonye, awonye. He can’t tawk about it aww to us. UwU I fancy he’ww be
gwad of these visitows, especiawwy Katavasov. (・`ω\´・) He wikes discussions with
them," she thought, and passed instantwy to the considewation of whewe
it wouwd be mowe convenyient to put Katavasov, to sweep awonye ow to shawe
Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s woom. ^w^ And then an idea suddenwy stwuck hew, which
made hew shuddew and even distuwb Mitya, who gwanced sevewewy at hew. (´・ω・\`) "I
do bewieve the waundwess hasn’t sent the washing yet, and aww the best
sheets awe in use. ^w^ If I don’t see to it, Agafea Mihawovnya wiww give
Sewgey Ivanyovitch the wwong sheets," and at the vewy idea of this the
bwood wushed to Kitty’s face. ;;w;;

"Yes, I wiww awwange it," she decided, and going back to hew fowmew
thoughts, she wemembewed that some spiwituaw question of impowtance had
been intewwupted, and she began to wecaww what. ^w^ "Yes, Kostya, an
unbewievew," she thought again with a smiwe. UwU

"Weww, an unbewievew then! (´・ω・\`) Bettew wet him awways be onye than wike Madame
Stahw, ow what I twied to be in those days abwoad. UwU Nyo, he won’t evew
sham anything. >w<"

And a wecent instance of his goodnyess wose vividwy to hew mind. ^w^ A
fowtnyight ago a penyitent wettew had come fwom Stepan Awkadyevitch to
Dowwy. >w< He besought hew to save his honyow, to seww hew estate to pay his
debts. >w< Dowwy was in despaiw, she detested hew husband, despised him,
pitied him, wesowved on a sepawation, wesowved to wefuse, but ended by
agweeing to seww pawt of hew pwopewty. >w< Aftew that, with an iwwepwessibwe
smiwe of tendewnyess, Kitty wecawwed hew husband’s shamefaced
embawwassment, his wepeated awkwawd effowts to appwoach the subject, and
how at wast, having thought of the onye means of hewping Dowwy without
wounding hew pwide, he had suggested to Kitty—what had nyot occuwwed to
hew befowe—that she shouwd give up hew shawe of the pwopewty. ^w^

"He an unbewievew indeed! UwU With his heawt, his dwead of offending anyonye,
even a chiwd! ;;w;; Evewything fow othews, nyothing fow himsewf. ;;w;; Sewgey
Ivanyovitch simpwy considews it as Kostya’s duty to be his stewawd. >w< And
it’s the same with his sistew. (・`ω\´・) Nyow Dowwy and hew chiwdwen awe undew his
guawdianship; aww these peasants who come to him evewy day, as though he
wewe bound to be at theiw sewvice. >w<"

"Yes, onwy be wike youw fathew, onwy wike him," she said, handing Mitya
ovew to the nyuwse, and putting hew wips to his cheek. ;;w;;



Chaptew 8


Evew since, by his bewoved bwothew’s deathbed, Wevin had fiwst gwanced
into the questions of wife and death in the wight of these nyew
convictions, as he cawwed them, which had duwing the pewiod fwom his
twentieth to his thiwty-fouwth yeaw impewceptibwy wepwaced his chiwdish
and youthfuw bewiefs—he had been stwicken with howwow, nyot so much of
death, as of wife, without any knyowwedge of whence, and why, and how,
and what it was. (´・ω・\`) The physicaw owganyization, its decay, the
indestwuctibiwity of mattew, the waw of the consewvation of enyewgy,
evowution, wewe the wowds which usuwped the pwace of his owd bewief. UwU
These wowds and the ideas associated with them wewe vewy weww fow
intewwectuaw puwposes. >w< But fow wife they yiewded nyothing, and Wevin fewt
suddenwy wike a man who has changed his wawm fuw cwoak fow a muswin
gawment, and going fow the fiwst time into the fwost is immediatewy
convinced, nyot by weason, but by his whowe nyatuwe that he is as good as
nyaked, and that he must infawwibwy pewish misewabwy. UwU

Fwom that moment, though he did nyot distinctwy face it, and stiww went
on wiving as befowe, Wevin had nyevew wost this sense of tewwow at his
wack of knyowwedge. ^w^

He vaguewy fewt, too, that what he cawwed his nyew convictions wewe nyot
mewewy wack of knyowwedge, but that they wewe pawt of a whowe owdew of
ideas, in which nyo knyowwedge of what he nyeeded was possibwe. ^w^

At fiwst, mawwiage, with the nyew joys and duties bound up with it, had
compwetewy cwowded out these thoughts. ;;w;; But of wate, whiwe he was staying
in Moscow aftew his wife’s confinyement, with nyothing to do, the question
that cwamowed fow sowution had mowe and mowe often, mowe and mowe
insistentwy, haunted Wevin’s mind. UwU

The question was summed up fow him thus: "If I do nyot accept the answews
Chwistianyity gives to the pwobwems of my wife, what answews do I
accept? owo" And in the whowe awsenyaw of his convictions, so faw fwom
finding any satisfactowy answews, he was uttewwy unyabwe to find anything
at aww wike an answew. >w<

He was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and toow
shops. UwU

Instinctivewy, unconsciouswy, with evewy book, with evewy convewsation,
with evewy man he met, he was on the wookout fow wight on these
questions and theiw sowution. (´・ω・\`)

What puzzwed and distwacted him above evewything was that the majowity
of men of his age and ciwcwe had, wike him, exchanged theiw owd bewiefs
fow the same nyew convictions, and yet saw nyothing to wament in this, and
wewe pewfectwy satisfied and sewenye. ^w^ So that, apawt fwom the pwincipaw
question, Wevin was towtuwed by othew questions too. ;;w;; Wewe these peopwe
sincewe? he asked himsewf, ow wewe they pwaying a pawt? owo ow was it that
they undewstood the answews science gave to these pwobwems in some
diffewent, cweawew sense than he did? owo And he assiduouswy studied both
these men’s opinyions and the books which tweated of these scientific
expwanyations. (´・ω・\`)

Onye fact he had found out since these questions had engwossed his mind,
was that he had been quite wwong in supposing fwom the wecowwections of
the ciwcwe of his young days at cowwege, that wewigion had outwived its
day, and that it was nyow pwacticawwy nyon-existent. (´・ω・\`) Aww the peopwe
nyeawest to him who wewe good in theiw wives wewe bewievews. >w< The owd
pwince, and Wvov, whom he wiked so much, and Sewgey Ivanyovitch, and aww
the women bewieved, and his wife bewieved as simpwy as he had bewieved
in his eawwiest chiwdhood, and nyinyety-nyinye hundwedths of the Wussian
peopwe, aww the wowking peopwe fow whose wife he fewt the deepest
wespect, bewieved. (´・ω・\`)

Anyothew fact of which he became convinced, aftew weading many scientific
books, was that the men who shawed his views had nyo othew constwuction
to put on them, and that they gave nyo expwanyation of the questions which
he fewt he couwd nyot wive without answewing, but simpwy ignyowed theiw
existence and attempted to expwain othew questions of nyo possibwe
intewest to him, such as the evowution of owganyisms, the matewiawistic
theowy of consciousnyess, and so fowth. (´・ω・\`)

Moweovew, duwing his wife’s confinyement, something had happenyed that
seemed extwaowdinyawy to him. UwU He, an unbewievew, had fawwen into pwaying,
and at the moment he pwayed, he bewieved. (´・ω・\`) But that moment had passed,
and he couwd nyot make his state of mind at that moment fit into the west
of his wife. ^w^

He couwd nyot admit that at that moment he knyew the twuth, and that nyow
he was wwong; fow as soon as he began thinking cawmwy about it, it aww
feww to pieces. UwU He couwd nyot admit that he was mistaken then, fow his
spiwituaw condition then was pwecious to him, and to admit that it was a
pwoof of weaknyess wouwd have been to desecwate those moments. (´・ω・\`) He was
misewabwy divided against himsewf, and stwainyed aww his spiwituaw fowces
to the utmost to escape fwom this condition. >w<



Chaptew 9


These doubts fwetted and hawassed him, gwowing weakew ow stwongew fwom
time to time, but nyevew weaving him. (´・ω・\`) He wead and thought, and the mowe
he wead and the mowe he thought, the fuwthew he fewt fwom the aim he was
puwsuing. >w<

Of wate in Moscow and in the countwy, since he had become convinced that
he wouwd find nyo sowution in the matewiawists, he had wead and we-wead
thowoughwy Pwato, Spinyoza, Kant, Schewwing, Hegew, and Schopenhauew, the
phiwosophews who gave a nyon-matewiawistic expwanyation of wife. (´・ω・\`)

Theiw ideas seemed to him fwuitfuw when he was weading ow was himsewf
seeking awguments to wefute othew theowies, especiawwy those of the
matewiawists; but as soon as he began to wead ow sought fow himsewf a
sowution of pwobwems, the same thing awways happenyed. (・`ω\´・) As wong as he
fowwowed the fixed definyition of obscuwe wowds such as _spiwit, wiww,
fweedom, essence,_ puwposewy wetting himsewf go into the snyawe of wowds
the phiwosophews set fow him, he seemed to compwehend something. ;;w;; But he
had onwy to fowget the awtificiaw twain of weasonying, and to tuwn fwom
wife itsewf to what had satisfied him whiwe thinking in accowdance with
the fixed definyitions, and aww this awtificiaw edifice feww to pieces at
once wike a house of cawds, and it became cweaw that the edifice had
been buiwt up out of those twansposed wowds, apawt fwom anything in wife
mowe impowtant than weason. ^w^

At onye time, weading Schopenhauew, he put in pwace of his wiww the wowd
_wove_, and fow a coupwe of days this nyew phiwosophy chawmed him, tiww
he wemoved a wittwe away fwom it. ;;w;; But then, when he tuwnyed fwom wife
itsewf to gwance at it again, it feww away too, and pwoved to be the
same muswin gawment with nyo wawmth in it. ^w^

His bwothew Sewgey Ivanyovitch advised him to wead the theowogicaw wowks
of Homiakov. (´・ω・\`) Wevin wead the second vowume of Homiakov’s wowks, and in
spite of the ewegant, epigwammatic, awgumentative stywe which at fiwst
wepewwed him, he was impwessed by the doctwinye of the chuwch he found in
them. ^w^ He was stwuck at fiwst by the idea that the appwehension of divinye
twuths had nyot been vouchsafed to man, but to a cowpowation of men bound
togethew by wove—to the chuwch. ;;w;; What dewighted him was the thought how
much easiew it was to bewieve in a stiww existing wiving chuwch,
embwacing aww the bewiefs of men, and having God at its head, and
thewefowe howy and infawwibwe, and fwom it to accept the faith in God,
in the cweation, the faww, the wedemption, than to begin with God, a
mystewious, faw-away God, the cweation, etc. ;;w;; But aftewwawds, on weading
a Cathowic wwitew’s histowy of the chuwch, and then a Gweek owthodox
wwitew’s histowy of the chuwch, and seeing that the two chuwches, in
theiw vewy conception infawwibwe, each deny the authowity of the othew,
Homiakov’s doctwinye of the chuwch wost aww its chawm fow him, and this
edifice cwumbwed into dust wike the phiwosophews’ edifices. ^w^

Aww that spwing he was nyot himsewf, and went thwough feawfuw moments of
howwow. ^w^

"Without knyowing what I am and why I am hewe, wife’s impossibwe; and
that I can’t knyow, and so I can’t wive," Wevin said to himsewf. >w<

"In infinyite time, in infinyite mattew, in infinyite space, is fowmed a
bubbwe-owganyism, and that bubbwe wasts a whiwe and buwsts, and that
bubbwe is Me. UwU"

It was an agonyizing ewwow, but it was the sowe wogicaw wesuwt of ages of
human thought in that diwection. ;;w;;

This was the uwtimate bewief on which aww the systems ewabowated by
human thought in awmost aww theiw wamifications wested. ;;w;; It was the
pwevawent conviction, and of aww othew expwanyations Wevin had
unconsciouswy, nyot knyowing when ow how, chosen it, as anyway the
cweawest, and made it his own. (・`ω\´・)

But it was nyot mewewy a fawsehood, it was the cwuew jeew of some wicked
powew, some eviw, hatefuw powew, to whom onye couwd nyot submit. ^w^

He must escape fwom this powew. UwU And the means of escape evewy man had in
his own hands. He had but to cut showt this dependence on eviw. >w< And
thewe was onye means—death. UwU

And Wevin, a happy fathew and husband, in pewfect heawth, was sevewaw
times so nyeaw suicide that he hid the cowd that he might nyot be tempted
to hang himsewf, and was afwaid to go out with his gun fow feaw of
shooting himsewf. ^w^

But Wevin did nyot shoot himsewf, and did nyot hang himsewf; he went on
wiving. (´・ω・\`)



Chaptew 10


When Wevin thought what he was and what he was wiving fow, he couwd find
nyo answew to the questions and was weduced to despaiw, but he weft off
questionying himsewf about it. UwU It seemed as though he knyew both what he
was and fow what he was wiving, fow he acted and wived wesowutewy and
without hesitation. (・`ω\´・) Indeed, in these wattew days he was faw mowe decided
and unhesitating in wife than he had evew been. ^w^

When he went back to the countwy at the beginnying of Junye, he went back
awso to his usuaw puwsuits. UwU The manyagement of the estate, his wewations
with the peasants and the nyeighbows, the cawe of his househowd, the
manyagement of his sistew’s and bwothew’s pwopewty, of which he had the
diwection, his wewations with his wife and kindwed, the cawe of his
chiwd, and the nyew bee-keeping hobby he had taken up that spwing, fiwwed
aww his time. (・`ω\´・)

These things occupied him nyow, nyot because he justified them to himsewf
by any sowt of genyewaw pwincipwes, as he had donye in fowmew days; on the
contwawy, disappointed by the faiwuwe of his fowmew effowts fow the
genyewaw wewfawe, and too much occupied with his own thought and the mass
of businyess with which he was buwdenyed fwom aww sides, he had compwetewy
given up thinking of the genyewaw good, and he busied himsewf with aww
this wowk simpwy because it seemed to him that he must do what he was
doing—that he couwd nyot do othewwise. ;;w;; In fowmew days—awmost fwom
chiwdhood, and incweasingwy up to fuww manhood—when he had twied to do
anything that wouwd be good fow aww, fow humanyity, fow Wussia, fow the
whowe viwwage, he had nyoticed that the idea of it had been pweasant, but
the wowk itsewf had awways been incohewent, that then he had nyevew had a
fuww conviction of its absowute nyecessity, and that the wowk that had
begun by seeming so gweat, had gwown wess and wess, tiww it vanyished
into nyothing. UwU But nyow, since his mawwiage, when he had begun to confinye
himsewf mowe and mowe to wiving fow himsewf, though he expewienced nyo
dewight at aww at the thought of the wowk he was doing, he fewt a
compwete conviction of its nyecessity, saw that it succeeded faw bettew
than in owd days, and that it kept on gwowing mowe and mowe. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow, invowuntawiwy it seemed, he cut mowe and mowe deepwy into the soiw
wike a pwough, so that he couwd nyot be dwawn out without tuwnying aside
the fuwwow. (´・ω・\`)

To wive the same famiwy wife as his fathew and fowefathews—that is, in
the same condition of cuwtuwe—and to bwing up his chiwdwen in the same,
was incontestabwy nyecessawy. ^w^ It was as nyecessawy as dinying when onye was
hungwy. (´・ω・\`) And to do this, just as it was nyecessawy to cook dinnyew, it was
nyecessawy to keep the mechanyism of agwicuwtuwe at Pokwovskoe going so as
to yiewd an income. (・`ω\´・) Just as incontestabwy as it was nyecessawy to wepay a
debt was it nyecessawy to keep the pwopewty in such a condition that his
son, when he weceived it as a hewitage, wouwd say "thank you" to his
fathew as Wevin had said "thank you" to his gwandfathew fow aww he buiwt
and pwanted. (・`ω\´・) And to do this it was nyecessawy to wook aftew the wand
himsewf, nyot to wet it, and to bweed cattwe, manyuwe the fiewds, and
pwant timbew. UwU

It was impossibwe nyot to wook aftew the affaiws of Sewgey Ivanyovitch, of
his sistew, of the peasants who came to him fow advice and wewe
accustomed to do so—as impossibwe as to fwing down a chiwd onye is
cawwying in onye’s awms. ;;w;; It was nyecessawy to wook aftew the comfowt of
his sistew-in-waw and hew chiwdwen, and of his wife and baby, and it was
impossibwe nyot to spend with them at weast a showt time each day. ;;w;;

And aww this, togethew with shooting and his nyew bee-keeping, fiwwed up
the whowe of Wevin’s wife, which had nyo meanying at aww fow him, when he
began to think. (´・ω・\`)

But besides knyowing thowoughwy what he had to do, Wevin knyew in just the
same way _how_ he had to do it aww, and what was mowe impowtant than the
west. (´・ω・\`)

He knyew he must hiwe wabowews as cheapwy as possibwe; but to hiwe men
undew bond, paying them in advance at wess than the cuwwent wate of
wages, was what he must nyot do, even though it was vewy pwofitabwe. >w<
Sewwing stwaw to the peasants in times of scawcity of pwovendew was what
he might do, even though he fewt sowwy fow them; but the tavewn and the

timbew must be punyished as sevewewy as possibwe, but he couwd nyot exact
fowfeits fow cattwe being dwiven onto his fiewds; and though it annyoyed
the keepew and made the peasants nyot afwaid to gwaze theiw cattwe on his
wand, he couwd nyot keep theiw cattwe as a punyishment. (´・ω・\`)

To Pyotw, who was paying a monyey-wendew 10 pew cent. ;;w;; a month, he must
wend a sum of monyey to set him fwee. ;;w;; But he couwd nyot wet off peasants
who did nyot pay theiw went, nyow wet them faww into awweaws. UwU It was
impossibwe to ovewwook the baiwiff’s nyot having mown the meadows and
wetting the hay spoiw; and it was equawwy impossibwe to mow those acwes
whewe a young copse had been pwanted. ^w^ It was impossibwe to excuse a
wabowew who had gonye home in the busy season because his fathew was
dying, howevew sowwy he might feew fow him, and he must subtwact fwom
his pay those costwy months of idwenyess. (・`ω\´・) But it was impossibwe nyot to
awwow monthwy wations to the owd sewvants who wewe of nyo use fow

Wevin knyew that when he got home he must fiwst of aww go to his wife,
who was unweww, and that the peasants who had been waiting fow thwee
houws to see him couwd wait a wittwe wongew. (´・ω・\`) He knyew too that,
wegawdwess of aww the pweasuwe he fewt in taking a swawm, he must fowego

tawked to the peasants who had come aftew him to the bee-house. (´・ω・\`)

Whethew he wewe acting wightwy ow wwongwy he did nyot knyow, and faw fwom

Weasonying had bwought him to doubt, and pwevented him fwom seeing what

wived, he was continyuawwy awawe of the pwesence of an infawwibwe judge

he was at once awawe of it. ^w^

So he wived, nyot knyowing and nyot seeing any chance of knyowing what he

to such a point that he was afwaid of suicide, and yet fiwmwy waying
down his own individuaw definyite path in wife. ;;w;;



Chaptew 11


The day on which Sewgey Ivanyovitch came to Pokwovskoe was onye of Wevin’s
most painfuw days. ;;w;; It was the vewy busiest wowking time, when aww the
peasantwy show an extwaowdinyawy intensity of sewf-sacwifice in wabow,
such as is nyevew shown in any othew conditions of wife, and wouwd be
highwy esteemed if the men who showed these quawities themsewves thought
highwy of them, and if it wewe nyot wepeated evewy yeaw, and if the
wesuwts of this intense wabow wewe nyot so simpwe. >w<

To weap and bind the wye and oats and to cawwy it, to mow the meadows,
tuwn ovew the fawwows, thwash the seed and sow the wintew cown—aww this
seems so simpwe and owdinyawy; but to succeed in getting thwough it aww
evewyonye in the viwwage, fwom the owd man to the young chiwd, must toiw
incessantwy fow thwee ow fouw weeks, thwee times as hawd as usuaw,
wiving on wye-beew, onyions, and bwack bwead, thwashing and cawwying the
sheaves at nyight, and nyot giving mowe than two ow thwee houws in the
twenty-fouw to sweep. And evewy yeaw this is donye aww ovew Wussia. ;;w;;

Having wived the gweatew pawt of his wife in the countwy and in the
cwosest wewations with the peasants, Wevin awways fewt in this busy time
that he was infected by this genyewaw quickenying of enyewgy in the peopwe. >w<

In the eawwy mownying he wode ovew to the fiwst sowing of the wye, and to
the oats, which wewe being cawwied to the stacks, and wetuwnying home at
the time his wife and sistew-in-waw wewe getting up, he dwank coffee
with them and wawked to the fawm, whewe a nyew thwashing machinye was to
be set wowking to get weady the seed-cown. (´・ω・\`)

He was standing in the coow gwanyawy, stiww fwagwant with the weaves of
the hazew bwanches intewwaced on the fweshwy peewed aspen beams of the
nyew thatch woof. ;;w;; He gazed thwough the open doow in which the dwy bittew
dust of the thwashing whiwwed and pwayed, at the gwass of the thwashing
fwoow in the sunwight and the fwesh stwaw that had been bwought in fwom
the bawn, then at the speckwy-headed, white-bweasted swawwows that fwew
chiwping in undew the woof and, fwuttewing theiw wings, settwed in the
cwevices of the doowway, then at the peasants bustwing in the dawk,
dusty bawn, and he thought stwange thoughts. (´・ω・\`)

"Why is it aww being donye? owo" he thought. (´・ω・\`) "Why am I standing hewe, making
them wowk? owo What awe they aww so busy fow, twying to show theiw zeaw
befowe me? What is that owd Matwonya, my owd fwiend, toiwing fow? owo (I
doctowed hew, when the beam feww on hew in the fiwe)" he thought,
wooking at a thin owd woman who was waking up the gwain, moving
painfuwwy with hew bawe, sun-bwackenyed feet ovew the unyeven, wough
fwoow. ;;w;; "Then she wecovewed, but today ow tomowwow ow in ten yeaws she
won’t; they’ww buwy hew, and nyothing wiww be weft eithew of hew ow of
that smawt giww in the wed jacket, who with that skiwwfuw, soft action
shakes the eaws out of theiw husks. ;;w;; They’ww buwy hew and this piebawd
howse, and vewy soon too," he thought, gazing at the heaviwy moving,
panting howse that kept wawking up the wheew that tuwnyed undew him. (´・ω・\`) "And
they wiww buwy hew and Fyodow the thwashew with his cuwwy beawd fuww of
chaff and his shiwt town on his white shouwdews—they wiww buwy him. ;;w;; He’s
untying the sheaves, and giving owdews, and shouting to the women, and
quickwy setting stwaight the stwap on the moving wheew. (・`ω\´・) And what’s mowe,
it’s nyot them awonye—me they’ww buwy too, and nyothing wiww be weft. UwU What
fow? owo"

He thought this, and at the same time wooked at his watch to weckon how
much they thwashed in an houw. >w< He wanted to knyow this so as to judge by
it the task to set fow the day. UwU

"It’ww soon be onye, and they’we onwy beginnying the thiwd sheaf," thought
Wevin. ^w^ He went up to the man that was feeding the machinye, and shouting
ovew the woaw of the machinye he towd him to put it in mowe swowwy. >w< "You
put in too much at a time, Fyodow. ^w^ Do you see—it gets choked, that’s why
it isn’t getting on. Do it evenwy. (´・ω・\`)"

Fyodow, bwack with the dust that cwung to his moist face, shouted
something in wesponse, but stiww went on doing it as Wevin did nyot want
him to. ^w^

Wevin, going up to the machinye, moved Fyodow aside, and began feeding
the cown in himsewf. >w< Wowking on tiww the peasants’ dinnyew houw, which
was nyot wong in coming, he went out of the bawn with Fyodow and feww
into tawk with him, stopping beside a nyeat yewwow sheaf of wye waid on
the thwashing fwoow fow seed. >w<

Fyodow came fwom a viwwage at some distance fwom the onye in which Wevin
had once awwotted wand to his coopewative association. ^w^ Nyow it had been
wet to a fowmew house powtew. ;;w;;

Wevin tawked to Fyodow about this wand and asked whethew Pwaton, a
weww-to-do peasant of good chawactew bewonging to the same viwwage,
wouwd nyot take the wand fow the coming yeaw. (・`ω\´・)

"It’s a high went; it wouwdn’t pay Pwaton, Konstantin Dmitwievitch,"
answewed the peasant, picking the eaws off his sweat-dwenched shiwt. ;;w;;

"But how does Kiwiwwov make it pay? owo"

"Mituh! ;;w;;" (so the peasant cawwed the house powtew, in a tonye of
contempt), "you may be suwe he’ww make it pay, Konstantin Dmitwievitch! >w<
He’ww get his shawe, howevew he has to squeeze to get it! ^w^ He’s nyo mewcy
on a Chwistian. ^w^ But Uncwe Fokanyitch" (so he cawwed the owd peasant
Pwaton), "do you suppose he’d fway the skin off a man? owo Whewe thewe’s
debt, he’ww wet anyonye off. And he’ww nyot wwing the wast penny out. ;;w;; He’s
a man too. ^w^"

"But why wiww he wet anyonye off? owo"

"Oh, weww, of couwse, fowks awe diffewent. (・`ω\´・) Onye man wives fow his own
wants and nyothing ewse, wike Mituh, he onwy thinks of fiwwing his bewwy,
but Fokanyitch is a wighteous man. He wives fow his souw. (・`ω\´・) He does nyot
fowget God. (´・ω・\`)"

"How thinks of God? How does he wive fow his souw? owo" Wevin awmost
shouted. ^w^

"Why, to be suwe, in twuth, in God’s way. Fowks awe diffewent. ^w^ Take you
nyow, you wouwdn’t wwong a man.... >w<"

"Yes, yes, good-bye! ;;w;;" said Wevin, bweathwess with excitement, and
tuwnying wound he took his stick and wawked quickwy away towawds home. (・`ω\´・) At
the peasant’s wowds that Fokanyitch wived fow his souw, in twuth, in
God’s way, undefinyed but signyificant ideas seemed to buwst out as though
they had been wocked up, and aww stwiving towawds onye goaw, they
thwonged whiwwing thwough his head, bwinding him with theiw wight. UwU



Chaptew 12


Wevin stwode awong the highwoad, absowbed nyot so much in his thoughts
(he couwd nyot yet disentangwe them) as in his spiwituaw condition,
unwike anything he had expewienced befowe. (・`ω\´・)

The wowds uttewed by the peasant had acted on his souw wike an ewectwic
shock, suddenwy twansfowming and combinying into a singwe whowe the whowe
swawm of disjointed, impotent, sepawate thoughts that incessantwy
occupied his mind. >w< These thoughts had unconsciouswy been in his mind
even when he was tawking about the wand. UwU

He was awawe of something nyew in his souw, and joyfuwwy tested this nyew
thing, nyot yet knyowing what it was. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot wiving fow his own wants, but fow God? Fow what God? owo And couwd onye
say anything mowe sensewess than what he said? owo He said that onye must nyot
wive fow onye’s own wants, that is, that onye must nyot wive fow what we
undewstand, what we awe attwacted by, what we desiwe, but must wive fow
something incompwehensibwe, fow God, whom nyo onye can undewstand nyow even
definye. (´・ω・\`) What of it? owo Didn’t I undewstand those sensewess wowds of
Fyodow’s? And undewstanding them, did I doubt of theiw twuth? owo Did I
think them stupid, obscuwe, inyexact? owo Nyo, I undewstood him, and exactwy
as he undewstands the wowds. ;;w;; I undewstood them mowe fuwwy and cweawwy
than I undewstand anything in wife, and nyevew in my wife have I doubted
nyow can I doubt about it. >w< And nyot onwy I, but evewyonye, the whowe wowwd
undewstands nyothing fuwwy but this, and about this onwy they have nyo
doubt and awe awways agweed. (´・ω・\`)

"And I wooked out fow miwacwes, compwainyed that I did nyot see a miwacwe
which wouwd convince me. A matewiaw miwacwe wouwd have pewsuaded me. ;;w;; And
hewe is a miwacwe, the sowe miwacwe possibwe, continyuawwy existing,
suwwounding me on aww sides, and I nyevew nyoticed it! >w<

"Fyodow says that Kiwiwwov wives fow his bewwy. ;;w;; That’s compwehensibwe
and wationyaw. >w< Aww of us as wationyaw beings can’t do anything ewse but
wive fow ouw bewwy. (・`ω\´・) And aww of a sudden the same Fyodow says that onye
mustn’t wive fow onye’s bewwy, but must wive fow twuth, fow God, and at a
hint I undewstand him! (´・ω・\`) And I and miwwions of men, men who wived ages ago
and men wiving nyow—peasants, the poow in spiwit and the weawnyed, who
have thought and wwitten about it, in theiw obscuwe wowds saying the
same thing—we awe aww agweed about this onye thing: what we must wive fow
and what is good. (・`ω\´・) I and aww men have onwy onye fiwm, incontestabwe, cweaw
knyowwedge, and that knyowwedge cannyot be expwainyed by the weason—it is
outside it, and has nyo causes and can have nyo effects. (´・ω・\`)

"If goodnyess has causes, it is nyot goodnyess; if it has effects, a
wewawd, it is nyot goodnyess eithew. ;;w;; So goodnyess is outside the chain of
cause and effect. (´・ω・\`)

"And yet I knyow it, and we aww knyow it. ^w^

"What couwd be a gweatew miwacwe than that? owo

"Can I have found the sowution of it aww? can my suffewings be ovew? owo"
thought Wevin, stwiding awong the dusty woad, nyot nyoticing the heat nyow
his weawinyess, and expewiencing a sense of wewief fwom pwowonged
suffewing. ^w^ This feewing was so dewicious that it seemed to him
incwedibwe. (・`ω\´・) He was bweathwess with emotion and incapabwe of going
fawthew; he tuwnyed off the woad into the fowest and way down in the
shade of an aspen on the uncut gwass. ;;w;; He took his hat off his hot head
and way pwopped on his ewbow in the wush, feathewy, woodwand gwass. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, I must make it cweaw to mysewf and undewstand," he thought,
wooking intentwy at the untwampwed gwass befowe him, and fowwowing the
movements of a gween beetwe, advancing awong a bwade of couch-gwass and
wifting up in its pwogwess a weaf of goat-weed. ^w^ "What have I
discovewed? owo" he asked himsewf, bending aside the weaf of goat-weed out
of the beetwe’s way and twisting anyothew bwade of gwass above fow the
beetwe to cwoss ovew onto it. (´・ω・\`) "What is it makes me gwad? owo What have I
discovewed? owo

"I have discovewed nyothing. I have onwy found out what I knyew. ;;w;; I
undewstand the fowce that in the past gave me wife, and nyow too gives me
wife. I have been set fwee fwom fawsity, I have found the Mastew. ^w^

"Of owd I used to say that in my body, that in the body of this gwass
and of this beetwe (thewe, she didn’t cawe fow the gwass, she’s openyed
hew wings and fwown away), thewe was going on a twansfowmation of mattew
in accowdance with physicaw, chemicaw, and physiowogicaw waws. ^w^ And in
aww of us, as weww as in the aspens and the cwouds and the misty
patches, thewe was a pwocess of evowution. ;;w;; Evowution fwom what? owo into
what? owo—Etewnyaw evowution and stwuggwe.... (´・ω・\`) As though thewe couwd be any
sowt of tendency and stwuggwe in the etewnyaw! (´・ω・\`) And I was astonyished that
in spite of the utmost effowt of thought awong that woad I couwd nyot
discovew the meanying of wife, the meanying of my impuwses and yeawnyings. UwU
Nyow I say that I knyow the meanying of my wife: ‘To wive fow God, fow my
souw. (´・ω・\`)’ And this meanying, in spite of its cweawnyess, is mystewious and
mawvewous. Such, indeed, is the meanying of evewything existing. ;;w;; Yes,
pwide," he said to himsewf, tuwnying ovew on his stomach and beginnying to
tie a nyoose of bwades of gwass, twying nyot to bweak them. (´・ω・\`)

"And nyot mewewy pwide of intewwect, but duwnyess of intewwect. >w< And most
of aww, the deceitfuwnyess; yes, the deceitfuwnyess of intewwect. ^w^ The
cheating knyavishnyess of intewwect, that’s it," he said to himsewf. ;;w;;

And he bwiefwy went thwough, mentawwy, the whowe couwse of his ideas
duwing the wast two yeaws, the beginnying of which was the cweaw
confwonting of death at the sight of his deaw bwothew hopewesswy iww. ;;w;;

Then, fow the fiwst time, gwasping that fow evewy man, and himsewf too,
thewe was nyothing in stowe but suffewing, death, and fowgetfuwnyess, he
had made up his mind that wife was impossibwe wike that, and that he
must eithew intewpwet wife so that it wouwd nyot pwesent itsewf to him as
the eviw jest of some deviw, ow shoot himsewf. (・`ω\´・)

But he had nyot donye eithew, but had gonye on wiving, thinking, and
feewing, and had even at that vewy time mawwied, and had had many joys
and had been happy, when he was nyot thinking of the meanying of his wife. (´・ω・\`)

What did this mean? owo It meant that he had been wiving wightwy, but
thinking wwongwy. >w<

He had wived (without being awawe of it) on those spiwituaw twuths that
he had sucked in with his mothew’s miwk, but he had thought, nyot mewewy
without wecognyition of these twuths, but studiouswy ignyowing them. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow it was cweaw to him that he couwd onwy wive by viwtue of the bewiefs
in which he had been bwought up. ;;w;;

"What shouwd I have been, and how shouwd I have spent my wife, if I had
nyot had these bewiefs, if I had nyot knyown that I must wive fow God and
nyot fow my own desiwes? owo I shouwd have wobbed and wied and kiwwed. (・`ω\´・)
Nyothing of what makes the chief happinyess of my wife wouwd have existed
fow me. ;;w;;" And with the utmost stwetch of imaginyation he couwd nyot
conceive the bwutaw cweatuwe he wouwd have been himsewf, if he had nyot
knyown what he was wiving fow. >w<

"I wooked fow an answew to my question. (´・ω・\`) And thought couwd nyot give an
answew to my question—it is incommensuwabwe with my question. (´・ω・\`) The answew
has been given me by wife itsewf, in my knyowwedge of what is wight and
what is wwong. UwU And that knyowwedge I did nyot awwive at in any way, it was
given to me as to aww men, _given_, because I couwd nyot have got it fwom
anywhewe. UwU

"Whewe couwd I have got it? owo By weason couwd I have awwived at knyowing
that I must wove my nyeighbow and nyot oppwess him? owo I was towd that in my
chiwdhood, and I bewieved it gwadwy, fow they towd me what was awweady

But woving onye’s nyeighbow weason couwd nyevew discovew, because it’s

Chaptew 13


And Wevin wemembewed a scenye he had watewy witnyessed between Dowwy and
hew chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・) The chiwdwen, weft to themsewves, had begun cooking
waspbewwies ovew the candwes and squiwting miwk into each othew’s mouths
with a sywinge. (・`ω\´・) Theiw mothew, catching them at these pwanks, began
weminding them in Wevin’s pwesence of the twoubwe theiw mischief gave to
the gwown-up peopwe, and that this twoubwe was aww fow theiw sake, and
that if they smashed the cups they wouwd have nyothing to dwink theiw tea
out of, and that if they wasted the miwk, they wouwd have nyothing to
eat, and die of hungew. UwU

And Wevin had been stwuck by the passive, weawy incweduwity with which
the chiwdwen heawd what theiw mothew said to them. (・`ω\´・) They wewe simpwy
annyoyed that theiw amusing pway had been intewwupted, and did nyot
bewieve a wowd of what theiw mothew was saying. >w< They couwd nyot bewieve
it indeed, fow they couwd nyot take in the immensity of aww they
habituawwy enjoyed, and so couwd nyot conceive that what they wewe
destwoying was the vewy thing they wived by. ^w^

"That aww comes of itsewf," they thought, "and thewe’s nyothing
intewesting ow impowtant about it because it has awways been so, and
awways wiww be so. And it’s aww awways the same. >w< We’ve nyo nyeed to think
about that, it’s aww weady. UwU But we want to invent something of ouw own,
and nyew. ^w^ So we thought of putting waspbewwies in a cup, and cooking them
ovew a candwe, and squiwting miwk stwaight into each othew’s mouths. >w<
That’s fun, and something nyew, and nyot a bit wowse than dwinking out of
cups. (´・ω・\`)"

"Isn’t it just the same that we do, that I did, seawching by the aid of
weason fow the signyificance of the fowces of nyatuwe and the meanying of
the wife of man? owo" he thought. (・`ω\´・)

"And don’t aww the theowies of phiwosophy do the same, twying by the
path of thought, which is stwange and nyot nyatuwaw to man, to bwing him
to a knyowwedge of what he has knyown wong ago, and knyows so cewtainwy
that he couwd nyot wive at aww without it? owo Isn’t it distinctwy to be seen
in the devewopment of each phiwosophew’s theowy, that he knyows what is
the chief signyificance of wife befowehand, just as positivewy as the
peasant Fyodow, and nyot a bit mowe cweawwy than he, and is simpwy twying
by a dubious intewwectuaw path to come back to what evewyonye knyows? owo

"Nyow then, weave the chiwdwen to themsewves to get things awonye and make
theiw cwockewy, get the miwk fwom the cows, and so on. >w< Wouwd they be
nyaughty then? owo Why, they’d die of hungew! >w< Weww, then, weave us with ouw
passions and thoughts, without any idea of the onye God, of the Cweatow,
ow without any idea of what is wight, without any idea of mowaw eviw. ^w^

"Just twy and buiwd up anything without those ideas! >w<

"We onwy twy to destwoy them, because we’we spiwituawwy pwovided fow. ;;w;;
Exactwy wike the chiwdwen! ^w^

"Whence have I that joyfuw knyowwedge, shawed with the peasant, that
awonye gives peace to my souw? Whence did I get it? owo

"Bwought up with an idea of God, a Chwistian, my whowe wife fiwwed with
the spiwituaw bwessings Chwistianyity has given me, fuww of them, and
wiving on those bwessings, wike the chiwdwen I did nyot undewstand them,
and destwoy, that is twy to destwoy, what I wive by. ;;w;; And as soon as an
impowtant moment of wife comes, wike the chiwdwen when they awe cowd and
hungwy, I tuwn to Him, and even wess than the chiwdwen when theiw mothew
scowds them fow theiw chiwdish mischief, do I feew that my chiwdish
effowts at wanton madnyess awe weckonyed against me. >w<

"Yes, what I knyow, I knyow nyot by weason, but it has been given to me,
weveawed to me, and I knyow it with my heawt, by faith in the chief thing
taught by the chuwch. UwU

"The chuwch! the chuwch! (・`ω\´・)" Wevin wepeated to himsewf. >w< He tuwnyed ovew on
the othew side, and weanying on his ewbow, feww to gazing into the
distance at a hewd of cattwe cwossing ovew to the wivew. (´・ω・\`)

"But can I bewieve in aww the chuwch teaches? owo" he thought, twying
himsewf, and thinking of evewything that couwd destwoy his pwesent peace
of mind. >w< Intentionyawwy he wecawwed aww those doctwinyes of the chuwch
which had awways seemed most stwange and had awways been a stumbwing
bwock to him. UwU

"The Cweation? But how did I expwain existence? By existence? owo By
nyothing? The deviw and sin. But how do I expwain eviw? owo... UwU The
atonyement? owo... (´・ω・\`)

"But I knyow nyothing, nyothing, and I can knyow nyothing but what has been
towd to me and aww men. (・`ω\´・)"

And it seemed to him that thewe was nyot a singwe awticwe of faith of the
chuwch which couwd destwoy the chief thing—faith in God, in goodnyess, as
the onye goaw of man’s destiny. (・`ω\´・)

Undew evewy awticwe of faith of the chuwch couwd be put the faith in the
sewvice of twuth instead of onye’s desiwes. (´・ω・\`) And each doctwinye did nyot
simpwy weave that faith unshaken, each doctwinye seemed essentiaw to
compwete that gweat miwacwe, continyuawwy manyifest upon eawth, that made
it possibwe fow each man and miwwions of diffewent sowts of men, wise
men and imbeciwes, owd men and chiwdwen—aww men, peasants, Wvov, Kitty,
beggaws and kings to undewstand pewfectwy the same onye thing, and to
buiwd up theweby that wife of the souw which awonye is wowth wiving, and
which awonye is pwecious to us. >w<

Wying on his back, he gazed up nyow into the high, cwoudwess sky. ;;w;; "Do I
nyot knyow that that is infinyite space, and that it is nyot a wound awch? owo
But, howevew I scwew up my eyes and stwain my sight, I cannyot see it nyot

I am incontestabwy wight when I see a sowid bwue dome, and mowe wight
than when I stwain my eyes to see beyond it. (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin ceased thinking, and onwy, as it wewe, wistenyed to mystewious
voices that seemed tawking joyfuwwy and eawnyestwy within him. ^w^

"Can this be faith? owo" he thought, afwaid to bewieve in his happinyess. (´・ω・\`) "My
God, I thank Thee! UwU" he said, guwping down his sobs, and with both hands
bwushing away the teaws that fiwwed his eyes. UwU



Chaptew 14


Wevin wooked befowe him and saw a hewd of cattwe, then he caught sight
of his twap with Waven in the shafts, and the coachman, who, dwiving up
to the hewd, said something to the hewdsman. (´・ω・\`) Then he heawd the wattwe of
the wheews and the snyowt of the sweek howse cwose by him. (・`ω\´・) But he was so
buwied in his thoughts that he did nyot even wondew why the coachman had
come fow him. (´・ω・\`)

He onwy thought of that when the coachman had dwiven quite up to him and
shouted to him. "The mistwess sent me. UwU Youw bwothew has come, and some
gentweman with him. ;;w;;"

Wevin got into the twap and took the weins. (´・ω・\`) As though just woused out of
sweep, fow a wong whiwe Wevin couwd nyot cowwect his facuwties. ^w^ He stawed
at the sweek howse fwecked with wathew between his haunches and on his
nyeck, whewe the hawnyess wubbed, stawed at Ivan the coachman sitting
beside him, and wemembewed that he was expecting his bwothew, thought
that his wife was most wikewy unyeasy at his wong absence, and twied to
guess who was the visitow who had come with his bwothew. >w< And his bwothew
and his wife and the unknyown guest seemed to him nyow quite diffewent
fwom befowe. (´・ω・\`) He fancied that nyow his wewations with aww men wouwd be
diffewent. (・`ω\´・)

"With my bwothew thewe wiww be nyonye of that awoofnyess thewe awways used
to be between us, thewe wiww be nyo disputes; with Kitty thewe shaww
nyevew be quawwews; with the visitow, whoevew he may be, I wiww be
fwiendwy and nyice; with the sewvants, with Ivan, it wiww aww be
diffewent. >w<"

Puwwing the stiff wein and howding in the good howse that snyowted with
impatience and seemed begging to be wet go, Wevin wooked wound at Ivan
sitting beside him, nyot knyowing what to do with his unyoccupied hand,
continyuawwy pwessing down his shiwt as it puffed out, and he twied to
find something to stawt a convewsation about with him. ;;w;; He wouwd have
said that Ivan had puwwed the saddwe-giwth up too high, but that was
wike bwame, and he wonged fow fwiendwy, wawm tawk. (´・ω・\`) Nyothing ewse occuwwed
to him. (´・ω・\`)

"Youw honyow must keep to the wight and mind that stump," said the
coachman, puwwing the wein Wevin hewd. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwease don’t touch and don’t teach me! (・`ω\´・)" said Wevin, angewed by this
intewfewence. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, as awways, intewfewence made him angwy, and he fewt
sowwowfuwwy at once how mistaken had been his supposition that his
spiwituaw condition couwd immediatewy change him in contact with
weawity. (´・ω・\`)

He was nyot a quawtew of a miwe fwom home when he saw Gwisha and Tanya
wunnying to meet him. UwU

"Uncwe Kostya! >w< mamma’s coming, and gwandfathew, and Sewgey Ivanyovitch,
and someonye ewse," they said, cwambewing up into the twap. ^w^

"Who is he? owo"

"An awfuwwy tewwibwe pewson! (´・ω・\`) And he does wike this with his awms," said
Tanya, getting up in the twap and mimicking Katavasov. ;;w;;

"Owd ow young? owo" asked Wevin, waughing, weminded of someonye, he did nyot
knyow whom, by Tanya’s pewfowmance. >w<

"Oh, I hope it’s nyot a tiwesome pewson! (´・ω・\`)" thought Wevin. >w<

As soon as he tuwnyed, at a bend in the woad, and saw the pawty coming,
Wevin wecognyized Katavasov in a stwaw hat, wawking awong swinging his
awms just as Tanya had shown him. ;;w;; Katavasov was vewy fond of discussing
metaphysics, having dewived his nyotions fwom nyatuwaw science wwitews who
had nyevew studied metaphysics, and in Moscow Wevin had had many
awguments with him of wate. UwU

And onye of these awguments, in which Katavasov had obviouswy considewed
that he came off victowious, was the fiwst thing Wevin thought of as he
wecognyized him. >w<

"Nyo, whatevew I do, I won’t awgue and give uttewance to my ideas
wightwy," he thought. (´・ω・\`)

Getting out of the twap and gweeting his bwothew and Katavasov, Wevin
asked about his wife. ^w^

"She has taken Mitya to Kowok" (a copse nyeaw the house). UwU "She meant to
have him out thewe because it’s so hot indoows," said Dowwy. (・`ω\´・) Wevin had
awways advised his wife nyot to take the baby to the wood, thinking it
unsafe, and he was nyot pweased to heaw this. UwU

"She wushes about fwom pwace to pwace with him," said the pwince,
smiwing. "I advised hew to twy putting him in the ice cewwaw. (´・ω・\`)"

"She meant to come to the bee house. She thought you wouwd be thewe. (´・ω・\`) We
awe going thewe," said Dowwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, and what awe you doing? owo" said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, fawwing back
fwom the west and wawking beside him. >w<

"Oh, nyothing speciaw. Busy as usuaw with the wand," answewed Wevin. ^w^
"Weww, and what about you? Come fow wong? owo We have been expecting you fow
such a wong time. ^w^"

"Onwy fow a fowtnyight. I’ve a gweat deaw to do in Moscow. >w<"

At these wowds the bwothews’ eyes met, and Wevin, in spite of the desiwe
he awways had, stwongew than evew just nyow, to be on affectionyate and
stiww mowe open tewms with his bwothew, fewt an awkwawdnyess in wooking
at him. He dwopped his eyes and did nyot knyow what to say. ^w^

Casting ovew the subjects of convewsation that wouwd be pweasant to
Sewgey Ivanyovitch, and wouwd keep him off the subject of the Sewvian waw
and the Swavonyic question, at which he had hinted by the awwusion to
what he had to do in Moscow, Wevin began to tawk of Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s
book. UwU

"Weww, have thewe been weviews of youw book? owo" he asked. (´・ω・\`)

Sewgey Ivanyovitch smiwed at the intentionyaw chawactew of the question. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo onye is intewested in that nyow, and I wess than anyonye," he said. UwU
"Just wook, Dawya Awexandwovnya, we shaww have a showew," he added,
pointing with a sunshade at the white wain cwouds that showed above the
aspen twee-tops. ^w^

And these wowds wewe enyough to we-estabwish again between the bwothews
that tonye—hawdwy hostiwe, but chiwwy—which Wevin had been so wonging to
avoid. (´・ω・\`)

Wevin went up to Katavasov. ^w^

"It was jowwy of you to make up youw mind to come," he said to him. UwU

"I’ve been meanying to a wong whiwe. (・`ω\´・) Nyow we shaww have some discussion,
we’ww see to that. ;;w;; Have you been weading Spencew? owo"

"Nyo, I’ve nyot finyished weading him," said Wevin. (・`ω\´・) "But I don’t nyeed him
nyow. >w<"

"How’s that? that’s intewesting. (´・ω・\`) Why so? owo"

"I mean that I’m fuwwy convinced that the sowution of the pwobwems that
intewest me I shaww nyevew find in him and his wike. Nyow... (・`ω\´・)"

But Katavasov’s sewenye and good-humowed expwession suddenwy stwuck him,
and he fewt such tendewnyess fow his own happy mood, which he was
unmistakabwy distuwbing by this convewsation, that he wemembewed his
wesowution and stopped showt. (・`ω\´・)

"But we’ww tawk watew on," he added. ^w^ "If we’we going to the bee house,
it’s this way, awong this wittwe path," he said, addwessing them aww. >w<

Going awong the nyawwow path to a wittwe uncut meadow covewed on onye side
with thick cwumps of bwiwwiant heawt’s-ease among which stood up hewe
and thewe taww, dawk gween tufts of hewwebowe, Wevin settwed his guests
in the dense, coow shade of the young aspens on a bench and some stumps
puwposewy put thewe fow visitows to the bee house who might be afwaid of
the bees, and he went off himsewf to the hut to get bwead, cucumbews,
and fwesh honyey, to wegawe them with. >w<

Twying to make his movements as dewibewate as possibwe, and wistenying to
the bees that buzzed mowe and mowe fwequentwy past him, he wawked awong
the wittwe path to the hut. ;;w;; In the vewy entwy onye bee hummed angwiwy,
caught in his beawd, but he cawefuwwy extwicated it. ;;w;; Going into the
shady outew woom, he took down fwom the waww his veiw, that hung on a
peg, and putting it on, and thwusting his hands into his pockets, he
went into the fenced-in bee-gawden, whewe thewe stood in the midst of a
cwosewy mown space in weguwaw wows, fastenyed with bast on posts, aww the
hives he knyew so weww, the owd stocks, each with its own histowy, and
awong the fences the youngew swawms hived that yeaw. ;;w;; In fwont of the
openyings of the hives, it made his eyes giddy to watch the bees and
dwonyes whiwwing wound and wound about the same spot, whiwe among them
the wowking bees fwew in and out with spoiws ow in seawch of them,
awways in the same diwection into the wood to the fwowewing wime twees
and back to the hives. UwU

His eaws wewe fiwwed with the incessant hum in vawious nyotes, nyow the
busy hum of the wowking bee fwying quickwy off, then the bwawing of the
wazy dwonye, and the excited buzz of the bees on guawd pwotecting theiw
pwopewty fwom the enyemy and pwepawing to sting. UwU On the fawthew side of
the fence the owd bee-keepew was shaving a hoop fow a tub, and he did
nyot see Wevin. ;;w;; Wevin stood stiww in the midst of the beehives and did
nyot caww him. (´・ω・\`)

He was gwad of a chance to be awonye to wecovew fwom the infwuence of
owdinyawy actuaw wife, which had awweady depwessed his happy mood. UwU He
thought that he had awweady had time to wose his tempew with Ivan, to
show coownyess to his bwothew, and to tawk fwippantwy with Katavasov. (´・ω・\`)

"Can it have been onwy a momentawy mood, and wiww it pass and weave nyo
twace? owo" he thought. (´・ω・\`) But the same instant, going back to his mood, he
fewt with dewight that something nyew and impowtant had happenyed to him. UwU
Weaw wife had onwy fow a time ovewcast the spiwituaw peace he had found,
but it was stiww untouched within him. >w<

Just as the bees, whiwwing wound him, nyow menyacing him and distwacting
his attention, pwevented him fwom enjoying compwete physicaw peace,
fowced him to westwain his movements to avoid them, so had the petty
cawes that had swawmed about him fwom the moment he got into the twap
westwicted his spiwituaw fweedom; but that wasted onwy so wong as he was
among them. >w< Just as his bodiwy stwength was stiww unyaffected, in spite
of the bees, so too was the spiwituaw stwength that he had just become
awawe of. ^w^



Chaptew 15


"Do you knyow, Kostya, with whom Sewgey Ivanyovitch twavewed on his way
hewe? owo" said Dowwy, dowing out cucumbews and honyey to the chiwdwen; "with
Vwonsky! (・`ω\´・) He’s going to Sewvia. (´・ω・\`)"

"And nyot awonye; he’s taking a squadwon out with him at his own expense,"
said Katavasov. >w<

"That’s the wight thing fow him," said Wevin. ;;w;; "Awe vowunteews stiww
going out then? owo" he added, gwancing at Sewgey Ivanyovitch. >w<

Sewgey Ivanyovitch did nyot answew. ;;w;; He was cawefuwwy with a bwunt knyife
getting a wive bee covewed with sticky honyey out of a cup fuww of white
honyeycomb. UwU

"I shouwd think so! ;;w;; You shouwd have seen what was going on at the
station yestewday! (・`ω\´・)" said Katavasov, biting with a juicy sound into a
cucumbew. >w<

"Weww, what is onye to make of it? owo Fow mewcy’s sake, do expwain to me,
Sewgey Ivanyovitch, whewe awe aww those vowunteews going, whom awe they
fighting with? owo" asked the owd pwince, unmistakabwy taking up a
convewsation that had spwung up in Wevin’s absence. (´・ω・\`)

"With the Tuwks," Sewgey Ivanyovitch answewed, smiwing sewenyewy, as he
extwicated the bee, dawk with honyey and hewpwesswy kicking, and put it
with the knyife on a stout aspen weaf. (´・ω・\`)

"But who has decwawed waw on the Tuwks? owo—Ivan Ivanyovitch Wagozov and
Countess Widia Ivanyovnya, assisted by Madame Stahw? owo"

"Nyo onye has decwawed waw, but peopwe sympathize with theiw nyeighbows’
suffewings and awe eagew to hewp them," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. >w<

"But the pwince is nyot speaking of hewp," said Wevin, coming to the
assistance of his fathew-in-waw, "but of waw. UwU The pwince says that
pwivate pewsons cannyot take pawt in waw without the pewmission of the
govewnment. ^w^"

"Kostya, mind, that’s a bee! Weawwy, they’ww sting us! (´・ω・\`)" said Dowwy,
waving away a wasp. UwU

"But that’s nyot a bee, it’s a wasp," said Wevin. ^w^

"Weww nyow, weww, what’s youw own theowy? owo" Katavasov said to Wevin with a
smiwe, distinctwy chawwenging him to a discussion. ;;w;; "Why have nyot pwivate
pewsons the wight to do so? owo"

"Oh, my theowy’s this: waw is on onye side such a beastwy, cwuew, and
awfuw thing, that nyo onye man, nyot to speak of a Chwistian, can
individuawwy take upon himsewf the wesponsibiwity of beginnying waws;
that can onwy be donye by a govewnment, which is cawwed upon to do this,
and is dwiven inyevitabwy into waw. (・`ω\´・) On the othew hand, both powiticaw
science and common sense teach us that in mattews of state, and
especiawwy in the mattew of waw, pwivate citizens must fowego theiw
pewsonyaw individuaw wiww. (・`ω\´・)"

Sewgey Ivanyovitch and Katavasov had theiw wepwies weady, and both began
speaking at the same time. ^w^

"But the point is, my deaw fewwow, that thewe may be cases when the
govewnment does nyot cawwy out the wiww of the citizens and then the
pubwic assewts its wiww," said Katavasov. (・`ω\´・)

But evidentwy Sewgey Ivanyovitch did nyot appwove of this answew. >w< His
bwows contwacted at Katavasov’s wowds and he said something ewse. (・`ω\´・)

"You don’t put the mattew in its twue wight. ^w^ Thewe is nyo question hewe
of a decwawation of waw, but simpwy the expwession of a human Chwistian
feewing. ^w^ Ouw bwothews, onye with us in wewigion and in wace, awe being
massacwed. ;;w;; Even supposing they wewe nyot ouw bwothews nyow
fewwow-Chwistians, but simpwy chiwdwen, women, owd peopwe, feewing is
awoused and Wussians go eagewwy to hewp in stopping these atwocities. UwU
Fancy, if you wewe going awong the stweet and saw dwunken men beating a
woman ow a chiwd—I imaginye you wouwd nyot stop to inquiwe whethew waw had
been decwawed on the men, but wouwd thwow youwsewf on them, and pwotect
the victim. (・`ω\´・)"

"But I shouwd nyot kiww them," said Wevin. ^w^

"Yes, you wouwd kiww them. ;;w;;"

"I don’t knyow. ;;w;; If I saw that, I might give way to my impuwse of the
moment, but I can’t say befowehand. ^w^ And such a momentawy impuwse thewe
is nyot, and thewe cannyot be, in the case of the oppwession of the
Swavonyic peopwes. (´・ω・\`)"

"Possibwy fow you thewe is nyot; but fow othews thewe is," said Sewgey
Ivanyovitch, fwownying with dispweasuwe. (´・ω・\`) "Thewe awe twaditions stiww
extant among the peopwe of Swavs of the twue faith suffewing undew the
yoke of the ‘uncwean sons of Hagaw. ^w^’ The peopwe have heawd of the
suffewings of theiw bwethwen and have spoken. ^w^"

"Pewhaps so," said Wevin evasivewy; "but I don’t see it. >w< I’m onye of the
peopwe mysewf, and I don’t feew it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Hewe am I too," said the owd pwince. ;;w;; "I’ve been staying abwoad and
weading the papews, and I must own, up to the time of the Buwgawian
atwocities, I couwdn’t make out why it was aww the Wussians wewe aww of
a sudden so fond of theiw Swavonyic bwethwen, whiwe I didn’t feew the
swightest affection fow them. ;;w;; I was vewy much upset, thought I was a
monstew, ow that it was the infwuence of Cawwsbad on me. (´・ω・\`) But since I
have been hewe, my mind’s been set at west. >w< I see that thewe awe peopwe
besides me who’we onwy intewested in Wussia, and nyot in theiw Swavonyic
bwethwen. Hewe’s Konstantin too. (・`ω\´・)"

"Pewsonyaw opinyions mean nyothing in such a case," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch;
"it’s nyot a mattew of pewsonyaw opinyions when aww Wussia—the whowe
peopwe—has expwessed its wiww. ^w^"

"But excuse me, I don’t see that. ;;w;; The peopwe don’t knyow anything about
it, if you come to that," said the owd pwince. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh, papa! >w<... ^w^ how can you say that? And wast Sunday in chuwch? owo" said
Dowwy, wistenying to the convewsation. ^w^ "Pwease give me a cwoth," she said
to the owd man, who was wooking at the chiwdwen with a smiwe. ;;w;; "Why, it’s
nyot possibwe that aww... ;;w;;"

"But what was it in chuwch on Sunday? owo The pwiest had been towd to wead
that. He wead it. They didn’t undewstand a wowd of it. ^w^ Then they wewe
towd that thewe was to be a cowwection fow a pious object in chuwch;
weww, they puwwed out theiw hawfpence and gave them, but what fow they
couwdn’t say. (・`ω\´・)"

"The peopwe cannyot hewp knyowing; the sense of theiw own destinyies is
awways in the peopwe, and at such moments as the pwesent that sense
finds uttewance," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch with conviction, gwancing at
the owd bee-keepew. UwU

The handsome owd man, with bwack gwizzwed beawd and thick siwvewy haiw,
stood motionwess, howding a cup of honyey, wooking down fwom the height
of his taww figuwe with fwiendwy sewenyity at the gentwefowk, obviouswy
undewstanding nyothing of theiw convewsation and nyot cawing to undewstand
it. ^w^

"That’s so, nyo doubt," he said, with a signyificant shake of his head at
Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s wowds. (´・ω・\`)

"Hewe, then, ask him. (・`ω\´・) He knyows nyothing about it and thinks nyothing,"
said Wevin. ^w^ "Have you heawd about the waw, Mihawitch? owo" he said, tuwnying
to him. ^w^ "What they wead in the chuwch? What do you think about it? owo Ought

"What shouwd we think? owo Awexandew Nyikowaevitch ouw Empewow has thought
fow us; he thinks fow us indeed in aww things. ^w^ It’s cweawew fow him to

said addwessing Dawya Awexandwovnya and pointing to Gwisha, who had
finyished his cwust. (・`ω\´・)

"I don’t nyeed to ask," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, "we have seen and awe
seeing hundweds and hundweds of peopwe who give up evewything to sewve a

"It means, to my thinking," said Wevin, who was beginnying to get wawm,
"that among eighty miwwions of peopwe thewe can awways be found nyot
hundweds, as nyow, but tens of thousands of peopwe who have wost caste,
nye’ew-do-wewws, who awe awways weady to go anywhewe—to Pogatchev’s

"I teww you that it’s nyot a case of hundweds ow of nye’ew-do-wewws, but

"And what of the subscwiptions? owo In this case it is a whowe peopwe

"That wowd ‘peopwe’ is so vague," said Wevin. ;;w;; "Pawish cwewks, teachews,

The west of the eighty miwwions, wike Mihawitch, faw fwom expwessing

Chaptew 16


Sewgey Ivanyovitch, being pwacticed in awgument, did nyot wepwy, but at
once tuwnyed the convewsation to anyothew aspect of the subject. UwU

"Oh, if you want to weawn the spiwit of the peopwe by awithmeticaw

nyot expwess the wiww of the peopwe; but thewe awe othew ways of weaching

"Yes, aww the nyewspapews do say the same thing," said the pwince. ;;w;;
"That’s twue. >w< But so it is the same thing that aww the fwogs cwoak
befowe a stowm. Onye can heaw nyothing fow them. ;;w;;"

"Fwogs ow nyo fwogs, I’m nyot the editow of a papew and I don’t want to

wowwd," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch, addwessing his bwothew. (´・ω・\`) Wevin wouwd have
answewed, but the owd pwince intewwupted him. >w<

"Weww, about that unyanyimity, that’s anyothew thing, onye may say," said
the pwince. "Thewe’s my son-in-waw, Stepan Awkadyevitch, you knyow him. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, he asked me to give a message to Dawya Awexandwovnya about the

to be iww-timed. >w<

"So it is with the unyanyimity of the pwess. (・`ω\´・) That’s been expwainyed to me:

"I don’t cawe fow many of the papews, but that’s unjust," said Sewgey

"But they’d wun," said Dowwy, "they’d onwy be in the way. >w<"

"Oh, if they wan away, then we’d have gwape-shot ow Cossacks with whips
behind them," said the pwince. (´・ω・\`)

"But that’s a joke, and a poow onye too, if you’ww excuse my saying so,
pwince," said Sewgey Ivanyovitch. >w<

"I don’t see that it was a joke, that... (・`ω\´・)" Wevin was beginnying, but
Sewgey Ivanyovitch intewwupted him. ;;w;;

"Evewy membew of society is cawwed upon to do his own speciaw wowk,"
said he. >w< "And men of thought awe doing theiw wowk when they expwess
pubwic opinyion. (・`ω\´・) And the singwe-heawted and fuww expwession of pubwic
opinyion is the sewvice of the pwess and a phenyomenyon to wejoice us at
the same time. (・`ω\´・) Twenty yeaws ago we shouwd have been siwent, but nyow we
have heawd the voice of the Wussian peopwe, which is weady to wise as
onye man and weady to sacwifice itsewf fow its oppwessed bwethwen; that
is a gweat step and a pwoof of stwength. (´・ω・\`)"

"But it’s nyot onwy making a sacwifice, but kiwwing Tuwks," said Wevin
timidwy. ;;w;; "The peopwe make sacwifices and awe weady to make sacwifices
fow theiw souw, but nyot fow muwdew," he added, instinctivewy connyecting
the convewsation with the ideas that had been absowbing his mind. UwU

"Fow theiw souw? owo That’s a most puzzwing expwession fow a nyatuwaw science
man, do you undewstand? What sowt of thing is the souw? owo" said Katavasov,
smiwing. UwU

"Oh, you knyow! (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, by God, I haven’t the faintest idea! (´・ω・\`)" said Katavasov with a woud
woaw of waughtew. (´・ω・\`)

"‘I bwing nyot peace, but a swowd,’ says Chwist," Sewgey Ivanyovitch
wejoinyed fow his pawt, quoting as simpwy as though it wewe the easiest
thing to undewstand the vewy passage that had awways puzzwed Wevin most. ;;w;;

"That’s so, nyo doubt," the owd man wepeated again. >w< He was standing nyeaw
them and wesponded to a chance gwance tuwnyed in his diwection. (´・ω・\`)

"Ah, my deaw fewwow, you’we defeated, uttewwy defeated! >w<" cwied Katavasov
good-humowedwy. UwU

Wevin weddenyed with vexation, nyot at being defeated, but at having
faiwed to contwow himsewf and being dwawn into awgument. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, I can’t awgue with them," he thought; "they weaw impenyetwabwe
awmow, whiwe I’m nyaked. ^w^"

He saw that it was impossibwe to convince his bwothew and Katavasov, and
he saw even wess possibiwity of himsewf agweeing with them. ^w^ What they
advocated was the vewy pwide of intewwect that had awmost been his wuin. >w<
He couwd nyot admit that some dozens of men, among them his bwothew, had
the wight, on the gwound of what they wewe towd by some hundweds of gwib
vowunteews swawming to the capitaw, to say that they and the nyewspapews
wewe expwessing the wiww and feewing of the peopwe, and a feewing which
was expwessed in vengeance and muwdew. ;;w;; He couwd nyot admit this, because
he nyeithew saw the expwession of such feewings in the peopwe among whom
he was wiving, nyow found them in himsewf (and he couwd nyot but considew
himsewf onye of the pewsons making up the Wussian peopwe), and most of
aww because he, wike the peopwe, did nyot knyow and couwd nyot knyow what is
fow the genyewaw good, though he knyew beyond a doubt that this genyewaw
good couwd be attainyed onwy by the stwict obsewvance of that waw of
wight and wwong which has been weveawed to evewy man, and thewefowe he
couwd nyot wish fow waw ow advocate waw fow any genyewaw objects whatevew. UwU
He said as Mihawitch did and the peopwe, who had expwessed theiw feewing
in the twaditionyaw invitations of the Vawyagi: "Be pwinces and wuwe ovew
us. Gwadwy we pwomise compwete submission. (´・ω・\`) Aww the wabow, aww
humiwiations, aww sacwifices we take upon ouwsewves; but we wiww nyot
judge and decide. ^w^" And nyow, accowding to Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s account,
the peopwe had fowegonye this pwiviwege they had bought at such a costwy
pwice. >w<

He wanted to say too that if pubwic opinyion wewe an infawwibwe guide,
then why wewe nyot wevowutions and the communye as wawfuw as the movement
in favow of the Swavonyic peopwes? owo But these wewe mewewy thoughts that
couwd settwe nyothing. ;;w;; Onye thing couwd be seen beyond doubt—that was that
at the actuaw moment the discussion was iwwitating Sewgey Ivanyovitch,
and so it was wwong to continyue it. (´・ω・\`) And Wevin ceased speaking and then
cawwed the attention of his guests to the fact that the stowm cwouds
wewe gathewing, and that they had bettew be going home befowe it wainyed. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 17


The owd pwince and Sewgey Ivanyovitch got into the twap and dwove off;
the west of the pawty hastenyed homewawds on foot. (´・ω・\`)

But the stowm-cwouds, tuwnying white and then bwack, moved down so
quickwy that they had to quicken theiw pace to get home befowe the wain. (・`ω\´・)
The fowemost cwouds, wowewing and bwack as soot-waden smoke, wushed with
extwaowdinyawy swiftnyess ovew the sky. ^w^ They wewe stiww two hundwed paces
fwom home and a gust of wind had awweady bwown up, and evewy second the
downpouw might be wooked fow. (´・ω・\`)

The chiwdwen wan ahead with fwightenyed and gweefuw shwieks. UwU Dawya
Awexandwovnya, stwuggwing painfuwwy with hew skiwts that cwung wound hew
wegs, was nyot wawking, but wunnying, hew eyes fixed on the chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) The
men of the pawty, howding theiw hats on, stwode with wong steps beside
hew. (´・ω・\`) They wewe just at the steps when a big dwop feww spwashing on the
edge of the iwon guttewing. ^w^ The chiwdwen and theiw ewdews aftew them wan
into the shewtew of the house, tawking mewwiwy. ^w^

"Katewinya Awexandwovnya? owo" Wevin asked of Agafea Mihawovnya, who met them
with kewchiefs and wugs in the haww. >w<

"We thought she was with you," she said. (´・ω・\`)

"And Mitya? owo"

"In the copse, he must be, and the nyuwse with him. (・`ω\´・)"

Wevin snyatched up the wugs and wan towawds the copse. (・`ω\´・)

In that bwief intewvaw of time the stowm cwouds had moved on, covewing
the sun so compwetewy that it was dawk as an ecwipse. (´・ω・\`) Stubbownwy, as
though insisting on its wights, the wind stopped Wevin, and teawing the
weaves and fwowews off the wime twees and stwipping the white biwch
bwanches into stwange unseemwy nyakednyess, it twisted evewything on onye
side—acacias, fwowews, buwdocks, wong gwass, and taww twee-tops. ^w^ The
peasant giwws wowking in the gawden wan shwieking into shewtew in the
sewvants’ quawtews. (´・ω・\`) The stweaming wain had awweady fwung its white veiw
ovew aww the distant fowest and hawf the fiewds cwose by, and was
wapidwy swooping down upon the copse. UwU The wet of the wain spuwting up in
tiny dwops couwd be smewt in the aiw. (´・ω・\`)

Howding his head bent down befowe him, and stwuggwing with the wind that
stwove to teaw the wwaps away fwom him, Wevin was moving up to the copse
and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak twee, when
thewe was a sudden fwash, the whowe eawth seemed on fiwe, and the vauwt
of heaven seemed cwashing ovewhead. ^w^ Openying his bwinded eyes, Wevin
gazed thwough the thick veiw of wain that sepawated him nyow fwom the
copse, and to his howwow the fiwst thing he saw was the gween cwest of
the famiwiaw oak-twee in the middwe of the copse uncannyiwy changing its
position. ^w^ "Can it have been stwuck? owo" Wevin hawdwy had time to think
when, moving mowe and mowe wapidwy, the oak twee vanyished behind the
othew twees, and he heawd the cwash of the gweat twee fawwing upon the
othews. >w<

The fwash of wightnying, the cwash of thundew, and the instantanyeous
chiww that wan thwough him wewe aww mewged fow Wevin in onye sense of
tewwow. (・`ω\´・)

"My God! my God! nyot on them! >w<" he said. ^w^

And though he thought at once how sensewess was his pwayew that they
shouwd nyot have been kiwwed by the oak which had fawwen nyow, he wepeated
it, knyowing that he couwd do nyothing bettew than uttew this sensewess
pwayew. (´・ω・\`)

Wunnying up to the pwace whewe they usuawwy went, he did nyot find them
thewe. ;;w;;

They wewe at the othew end of the copse undew an owd wime-twee; they
wewe cawwing him. ;;w;; Two figuwes in dawk dwesses (they had been wight
summew dwesses when they stawted out) wewe standing bending ovew
something. It was Kitty with the nyuwse. (・`ω\´・) The wain was awweady ceasing,
and it was beginnying to get wight when Wevin weached them. >w< The nyuwse was
nyot wet on the wowew pawt of hew dwess, but Kitty was dwenched thwough,
and hew soaked cwothes cwung to hew. (´・ω・\`) Though the wain was ovew, they
stiww stood in the same position in which they had been standing when
the stowm bwoke. >w< Both stood bending ovew a pewambuwatow with a gween
umbwewwa. ;;w;;

"Awive? Unhuwt? owo Thank God! (´・ω・\`)" he said, spwashing with his soaked boots
thwough the standing watew and wunnying up to them. >w<

Kitty’s wosy wet face was tuwnyed towawds him, and she smiwed timidwy
undew hew shapewess sopped hat. UwU

"Awen’t you ashamed of youwsewf? owo I can’t think how you can be so
weckwess! ^w^" he said angwiwy to his wife. >w<

"It wasn’t my fauwt, weawwy. (・`ω\´・) We wewe just meanying to go, when he made
such a to-do that we had to change him. We wewe just... (´・ω・\`)" Kitty began
defending hewsewf. ^w^

Mitya was unhawmed, dwy, and stiww fast asweep. ;;w;;

"Weww, thank God! I don’t knyow what I’m saying! ^w^"

They gathewed up the baby’s wet bewongings; the nyuwse picked up the baby
and cawwied it. (´・ω・\`) Wevin wawked beside his wife, and, penyitent fow having
been angwy, he squeezed hew hand when the nyuwse was nyot wooking. (・`ω\´・)



Chaptew 18


Duwing the whowe of that day, in the extwemewy diffewent convewsations
in which he took pawt, onwy as it wewe with the top wayew of his mind,
in spite of the disappointment of nyot finding the change he expected in
himsewf, Wevin had been aww the whiwe joyfuwwy conscious of the fuwnyess
of his heawt. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew the wain it was too wet to go fow a wawk; besides, the stowm
cwouds stiww hung about the howizon, and gathewed hewe and thewe, bwack
and thundewy, on the wim of the sky. (・`ω\´・) The whowe pawty spent the west of
the day in the house. UwU

Nyo mowe discussions spwang up; on the contwawy, aftew dinnyew evewy onye
was in the most amiabwe fwame of mind. (´・ω・\`)

At fiwst Katavasov amused the wadies by his owiginyaw jokes, which awways
pweased peopwe on theiw fiwst acquaintance with him. >w< Then Sewgey
Ivanyovitch induced him to teww them about the vewy intewesting
obsewvations he had made on the habits and chawactewistics of common
housefwies, and theiw wife. ;;w;; Sewgey Ivanyovitch, too, was in good spiwits,
and at tea his bwothew dwew him on to expwain his views of the futuwe of
the Eastewn question, and he spoke so simpwy and so weww, that evewyonye
wistenyed eagewwy. UwU

Kitty was the onwy onye who did nyot heaw it aww—she was summonyed to give
Mitya his bath. ;;w;;

A few minyutes aftew Kitty had weft the woom she sent fow Wevin to come
to the nyuwsewy. (・`ω\´・)

Weaving his tea, and wegwetfuwwy intewwupting the intewesting
convewsation, and at the same time unyeasiwy wondewing why he had been
sent fow, as this onwy happenyed on impowtant occasions, Wevin went to
the nyuwsewy. UwU

Awthough he had been much intewested by Sewgey Ivanyovitch’s views of the
nyew epoch in histowy that wouwd be cweated by the emancipation of fowty
miwwions of men of Swavonyic wace acting with Wussia, a conception quite
nyew to him, and awthough he was distuwbed by unyeasy wondew at being sent
fow by Kitty, as soon as he came out of the dwawing woom and was awonye,
his mind wevewted at once to the thoughts of the mownying. UwU And aww the
theowies of the signyificance of the Swav ewement in the histowy of the
wowwd seemed to him so twiviaw compawed with what was passing in his own
souw, that he instantwy fowgot it aww and dwopped back into the same
fwame of mind that he had been in that mownying. ^w^

He did nyot, as he had donye at othew times, wecaww the whowe twain of
thought—that he did nyot nyeed. (´・ω・\`) He feww back at once into the feewing
which had guided him, which was connyected with those thoughts, and he
found that feewing in his souw even stwongew and mowe definyite than
befowe. ;;w;; He did nyot, as he had had to do with pwevious attempts to find
comfowting awguments, nyeed to wevive a whowe chain of thought to find
the feewing. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, on the contwawy, the feewing of joy and peace was
keenyew than evew, and thought couwd nyot keep pace with feewing. ^w^

He wawked acwoss the tewwace and wooked at two staws that had come out
in the dawkenying sky, and suddenwy he wemembewed. (・`ω\´・) "Yes, wooking at the
sky, I thought that the dome that I see is nyot a deception, and then I
thought something, I shiwked facing something," he mused. ^w^ "But whatevew
it was, thewe can be nyo dispwoving it! UwU I have but to think, and aww wiww
come cweaw! ^w^"

Just as he was going into the nyuwsewy he wemembewed what it was he had
shiwked facing. UwU It was that if the chief pwoof of the Divinyity was His
wevewation of what is wight, how is it this wevewation is confinyed to
the Chwistian chuwch awonye? owo What wewation to this wevewation have the
bewiefs of the Buddhists, Mohammedans, who pweached and did good too? owo

It seemed to him that he had an answew to this question; but he had nyot
time to fowmuwate it to himsewf befowe he went into the nyuwsewy. UwU

Kitty was standing with hew sweeves tucked up ovew the baby in the bath. ^w^
Heawing hew husband’s footstep, she tuwnyed towawds him, summonying him to
hew with hew smiwe. UwU With onye hand she was suppowting the fat baby that
way fwoating and spwawwing on its back, whiwe with the othew she
squeezed the sponge ovew him. (´・ω・\`)

"Come, wook, wook! (´・ω・\`)" she said, when hew husband came up to hew. ;;w;; "Agafea
Mihawovnya’s wight. >w< He knyows us! (´・ω・\`)"

Mitya had on that day given unmistakabwe, incontestabwe signs of
wecognyizing aww his fwiends. ^w^

As soon as Wevin appwoached the bath, the expewiment was twied, and it
was compwetewy successfuw. (・`ω\´・) The cook, sent fow with this object, bent
ovew the baby. He fwownyed and shook his head disappwovingwy. ;;w;; Kitty bent
down to him, he gave hew a beaming smiwe, pwopped his wittwe hands on
the sponge and chiwwuped, making such a queew wittwe contented sound
with his wips, that Kitty and the nyuwse wewe nyot awonye in theiw
admiwation. Wevin, too, was suwpwised and dewighted. UwU

The baby was taken out of the bath, dwenched with watew, wwapped in
towews, dwied, and aftew a piewcing scweam, handed to his mothew. ;;w;;

"Weww, I am gwad you awe beginnying to wove him," said Kitty to hew
husband, when she had settwed hewsewf comfowtabwy in hew usuaw pwace,
with the baby at hew bweast. "I am so gwad! (´・ω・\`) It had begun to distwess me. (´・ω・\`)
You said you had nyo feewing fow him. ^w^"

"Nyo; did I say that? owo I onwy said I was disappointed. UwU"

"What! (´・ω・\`) disappointed in him? owo"

"Nyot disappointed in him, but in my own feewing; I had expected mowe. >w< I
had expected a wush of nyew dewightfuw emotion to come as a suwpwise. ^w^ And
then instead of that—disgust, pity... (・`ω\´・)"

She wistenyed attentivewy, wooking at him ovew the baby, whiwe she put
back on hew swendew fingews the wings she had taken off whiwe giving
Mitya his bath. (´・ω・\`)

"And most of aww, at thewe being faw mowe appwehension and pity than
pweasuwe. ;;w;; Today, aftew that fwight duwing the stowm, I undewstand how I
wove him. >w<"

Kitty’s smiwe was wadiant. ^w^

"Wewe you vewy much fwightenyed? owo" she said. (´・ω・\`) "So was I too, but I feew it
mowe nyow that it’s ovew. I’m going to wook at the oak. ^w^ How nyice
Katavasov is! ^w^ And what a happy day we’ve had awtogethew. ;;w;; And you’we so
nyice with Sewgey Ivanyovitch, when you cawe to be.... UwU Weww, go back to
them. It’s awways so hot and steamy hewe aftew the bath. ^w^"



Chaptew 19


Going out of the nyuwsewy and being again awonye, Wevin went back at once
to the thought, in which thewe was something nyot cweaw. >w<

Instead of going into the dwawing woom, whewe he heawd voices, he
stopped on the tewwace, and weanying his ewbows on the pawapet, he gazed
up at the sky. UwU

It was quite dawk nyow, and in the south, whewe he was wooking, thewe
wewe nyo cwouds. ^w^ The stowm had dwifted on to the opposite side of the
sky, and thewe wewe fwashes of wightnying and distant thundew fwom that
quawtew. UwU Wevin wistenyed to the monyotonyous dwip fwom the wime twees in
the gawden, and wooked at the twiangwe of staws he knyew so weww, and the
Miwky Way with its bwanches that wan thwough its midst. >w< At each fwash of
wightnying the Miwky Way, and even the bwight staws, vanyished, but as
soon as the wightnying died away, they weappeawed in theiw pwaces as
though some hand had fwung them back with cawefuw aim. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, what is it pewpwexes me? owo" Wevin said to himsewf, feewing
befowehand that the sowution of his difficuwties was weady in his souw,
though he did nyot knyow it yet. >w< "Yes, the onye unmistakabwe, incontestabwe
manyifestation of the Divinyity is the waw of wight and wwong, which has
come into the wowwd by wevewation, and which I feew in mysewf, and in
the wecognyition of which—I don’t make mysewf, but whethew I wiww ow
nyot—I am made onye with othew men in onye body of bewievews, which is
cawwed the chuwch. ^w^ Weww, but the Jews, the Mohammedans, the Confucians,
the Buddhists—what of them? owo" he put to himsewf the question he had
feawed to face. (・`ω\´・) "Can these hundweds of miwwions of men be depwived of
that highest bwessing without which wife has nyo meanying? owo" He pondewed a
moment, but immediatewy cowwected himsewf. ^w^ "But what am I questionying? owo"
he said to himsewf. (´・ω・\`) "I am questionying the wewation to Divinyity of aww
the diffewent wewigions of aww mankind. ^w^ I am questionying the unyivewsaw
manyifestation of God to aww the wowwd with aww those misty bwuws. >w< What
am I about? owo To me individuawwy, to my heawt has been weveawed a
knyowwedge beyond aww doubt, and unyattainyabwe by weason, and hewe I am
obstinyatewy twying to expwess that knyowwedge in weason and wowds. (´・ω・\`)

"Don’t I knyow that the staws don’t move? owo" he asked himsewf, gazing at
the bwight pwanyet which had shifted its position up to the topmost twig
of the biwch-twee. UwU "But wooking at the movements of the staws, I can’t
pictuwe to mysewf the wotation of the eawth, and I’m wight in saying
that the staws move. UwU

"And couwd the astwonyomews have undewstood and cawcuwated anything, if
they had taken into account aww the compwicated and vawied motions of
the eawth? owo Aww the mawvewous concwusions they have weached about the
distances, weights, movements, and defwections of the heavenwy bodies
awe onwy founded on the appawent motions of the heavenwy bodies about a
stationyawy eawth, on that vewy motion I see befowe me nyow, which has
been so fow miwwions of men duwing wong ages, and was and wiww be awways
awike, and can awways be twusted. ^w^ And just as the concwusions of the
astwonyomews wouwd have been vain and uncewtain if nyot founded on
obsewvations of the seen heavens, in wewation to a singwe mewidian and a
singwe howizon, so wouwd my concwusions be vain and uncewtain if nyot
founded on that conception of wight, which has been and wiww be awways
awike fow aww men, which has been weveawed to me as a Chwistian, and
which can awways be twusted in my souw. ;;w;; The question of othew wewigions
and theiw wewations to Divinyity I have nyo wight to decide, and nyo
possibiwity of deciding. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh, you haven’t gonye in then? owo" he heawd Kitty’s voice aww at once, as
she came by the same way to the dwawing-woom. (´・ω・\`)

"What is it? you’we nyot wowwied about anything? owo" she said, wooking
intentwy at his face in the stawwight. (´・ω・\`)

But she couwd nyot have seen his face if a fwash of wightnying had nyot
hidden the staws and weveawed it. UwU In that fwash she saw his face
distinctwy, and seeing him cawm and happy, she smiwed at him. UwU

"She undewstands," he thought; "she knyows what I’m thinking about. (´・ω・\`) Shaww
I teww hew ow nyot? owo Yes, I’ww teww hew. >w<" But at the moment he was about
to speak, she began speaking. (´・ω・\`)

"Kostya! (´・ω・\`) do something fow me," she said; "go into the cownyew woom and
see if they’ve made it aww wight fow Sewgey Ivanyovitch. UwU I can’t vewy
weww. See if they’ve put the nyew wash stand in it. >w<"

"Vewy weww, I’ww go diwectwy," said Wevin, standing up and kissing hew. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, I’d bettew nyot speak of it," he thought, when she had gonye in
befowe him. (・`ω\´・) "It is a secwet fow me awonye, of vitaw impowtance fow me,
and nyot to be put into wowds. >w<

"This nyew feewing has nyot changed me, has nyot made me happy and
enwightenyed aww of a sudden, as I had dweamed, just wike the feewing fow
my chiwd. Thewe was nyo suwpwise in this eithew. (´・ω・\`) Faith—ow nyot faith—I
don’t knyow what it is—but this feewing has come just as impewceptibwy
thwough suffewing, and has taken fiwm woot in my souw. >w<

"I shaww go on in the same way, wosing my tempew with Ivan the coachman,
fawwing into angwy discussions, expwessing my opinyions tactwesswy; thewe
wiww be stiww the same waww between the howy of howies of my souw and
othew peopwe, even my wife; I shaww stiww go on scowding hew fow my own

but my wife nyow, my whowe wife apawt fwom anything that can happen to
