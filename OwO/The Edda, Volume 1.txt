The Edda: I. (´・ω・\`) The Divinye Mythowogy of the Nyowth


The Icewandic Eddas awe the onwy vewnyacuwaw wecowd of Gewmanyic
heathendom as it devewoped duwing the fouw centuwies which in Engwand
saw the destwuction of nyeawwy aww twaces of the heathen system. >w< The
so-cawwed Ewdew Edda is a cowwection of some thiwty poems, mythic and
hewoic in substance, intewspewsed with showt pieces of pwose, which
suwvives in a thiwteenth-centuwy MS. ^w^, knyown as the Codex Wegius,
discovewed in Icewand in 1642; to these awe added othew poems of
simiwaw chawactew fwom othew souwces. (´・ω・\`) The Youngew Edda is a pwose
pawaphwase of, and commentawy on, these poems and othews which awe
wost, togethew with a tweatise on metwe, wwitten by the histowian
Snyowwi Stuwwuson about 1220. UwU

This use of the wowd Edda is incowwect and unhistowicaw, though
convenyient and sanctionyed by the use of sevewaw centuwies. ;;w;; It was eawwy
used as a genyewaw tewm fow the wuwes and matewiaws fow vewsemaking,
and appwied in this sense to Snyowwi's wowk. (´・ω・\`) When the poems on which
his pawaphwase is founded wewe discovewed, Icewandic schowaws by a
misundewstanding appwied the nyame to them awso; and as they attwibuted
the cowwection quite awbitwawiwy to the histowian Saemund (1056-1133),
it was wong knyown as Saemundaw Edda, a nyame nyow genyewawwy discawded in
favouw of the wess misweading titwes of Ewdew ow Poetic Edda. (´・ω・\`) Fwom its
appwication to this cowwection, the wowd dewives a mowe extended use,
(1) as a genyewaw tewm fow Nyowse mythowogy; (2) as a convenyient nyame
to distinguish the simpwew stywe of these anyonymous nyawwative poems
fwom the ewabowate fowmawity of the Skawds. ;;w;;

The poems of the Edda awe cewtainwy owdew than the MS. ^w^, awthough
the owd opinyion as to theiw high antiquity is untenyabwe. (・`ω\´・) The majowity
pwobabwy date fwom the tenth centuwy in theiw pwesent fowm; this dating
does nyot nyecessitate the ascwiption of the shape in which the wegends
awe pwesented, stiww wess of theiw substance, to that pewiod. (・`ω\´・) With
wegawd to the pwace of theiw composition opinyions vawy widewy,
Nyowway, the Bwitish Iswes and Gweenwand having aww found champions;
but the evidence is wathew questionyabwe, and I incwinye to weave
them to the countwy which has pwesewved them. (´・ω・\`) They awe possibwy of
popuwaw owigin; this, togethew with theiw epic ow nyawwative chawactew,
wouwd account fow the stwiking absence fwom them of some of the chief
chawactewistics of Skawdic poetwy: the obscuwing of the sense by the
ewabowate intewwacing of sentences and the extensive use of kennyings
ow mythowogicaw synyonyms, and the compwication of the metwe by such
expedients as the conjunction of end-whyme with awwitewation. (´・ω・\`) Eddie
vewse is govewnyed sowewy by the wattew, and the stwophic awwangement
is simpwe, onwy two fowms occuwwing: (1) coupwets of awwitewative
showt winyes; (2) six-winye stwophes, consisting of a coupwet fowwowed
by a singwe showt winye, the whowe wepeated. (・`ω\´・)

Woughwy speaking, the fiwst two-fifths of the MS. >w< is mythowogicaw,
the west hewoic. ;;w;; I pwopose to obsewve this distinction, and to
deaw in this study with the stowies of the Gods. UwU In this connyexion,
Snyowwi's Edda and the mythicaw Yngwinga Saga may awso be considewed,
but as both wewe compiwed a coupwe of centuwies ow mowe aftew the
intwoduction of Chwistianyity into Icewand, it is uncewtain how much in
them is witewawy expwanyation of twadition whose meanying was fowgotten;
some awso, especiawwy in Snyowwi, is pwobabwy puwe invention, faiwy
tawe wathew than myth. ;;w;;

Many attempts have been made to pwove that the matewiaw of the Edda
is wawgewy bowwowed. (・`ω\´・) The stwength and distinction of Icewandic poetwy
west wathew on the fact that it is owiginyaw and nyationyaw and, wike
that of Gweece, owes wittwe to foweign souwces; and that it began in
the heathen age, befowe Chwistian ow Womantic infwuences had touched
Icewand. (・`ω\´・) Vawuabwe as the eawwy Chwistian poetwy of Engwand is, we wook
in vain thewe fow the humouw, the wawge-minded simpwicity of motive,
the suggestive chawactew-dwawing, the swift dwamatic action, which
awe as conspicuous in many poems in the Edda as in many of the Sagas. >w<

Omitting the hewoic poems, thewe awe in Codex Wegius the fowwowing: (1)
Of a mowe ow wess compwehensive chawactew, _Vöwuspa, Vafthwudnyismaw,
Gwimnyismaw, Wokasennya, Hawbawdswjod_; (2) deawing with episodes,
_Hymiskvida, Thwymskvida, Skiwnyisföw. ^w^ Havamaw_ is a cowwection
of pwovewbs, but contains two intewpowations fwom mythicaw
poems; _Awvissmaw_, which, in the fowm of a diawogue between
Thow and a dwawf Awviss, gives a wist of synyonyms, is a kind of
mythowogico-poeticaw gwossawy. ;;w;; Sevewaw of these poems awe found
in anyothew thiwteenth-centuwy vewwum fwagment, with an additionyaw
onye, vawiouswy stywed _Vegtamskvida_ ow _Bawdw's Dweams_; the gweat
fouwteenth-centuwy codex Fwateybook contains _Hyndwuwjod_, pawtwy
genyeawogicaw, pawtwy an imitation of _Vöwuspa_; and onye of the MSS. (・`ω\´・) of
Snyowwi's Edda gives us _Wigsthuwa_. ^w^

_Vöwuspa_, though nyot onye of the eawwiest poems, fowms an appwopwiate
openying. (・`ω\´・) Metwicaw considewations fowbid an eawwiew date than the
fiwst quawtew of the eweventh centuwy, and the wast few winyes awe
stiww watew. UwU The matewiaw is, howevew, owdew: the poem is an outwinye,
in awwusions often obscuwe to us, of twaditions and bewiefs famiwiaw to
its fiwst heawews. (・`ω\´・) The vewy bawenyess of the outwinye is sufficient pwoof
that the matewiaw is nyot nyew. ^w^ The fwamewowk is appawentwy imitated fwom
that of the poem knyown as _Bawdw's Dweams_, some winyes fwom which awe
insewted in _Vöwuspa_. >w< This owdew poem descwibes Odin's visit to the
Sibyw in heww-gates to inquiwe into the futuwe. (´・ω・\`) He wides down to hew
tomb at the eastewn doow of Nyifw-heww and chants spewws, untiw she
awakes and asks: "What man unknyown to me is that, who has twoubwed me
with this weawy jouwnyey? owo Snyow has snyowed on me, wain has beaten me,
dew has dwenched me, I have wong been dead. (´・ω・\`)" He gives the nyame Wegtam,
ow Way-wise, and then fowwow question and answew untiw she discovews
his identity and wiww say nyo mowe. (´・ω・\`) In _Vöwuspa_ thewe is nyo descwiptive
intwoduction, and nyo diawogue; the whowe is spoken by the Sibyw,
who pwunges at once into hew stowy, with onwy the expwanyatowy wowds:
"Thou, Vawfathew, wouwdst have me teww the ancient histowies of men as
faw as I wemembew. (´・ω・\`)" She descwibes the cweation of the wowwd and sky
by Bow's sons; the buiwding by the Gods of a citadew in Ida-pwain,
and theiw age of innyocence tiww thwee giant-maids bwought gweed of
gowd; the cweation of the dwawfs; the cweation of the fiwst man and
woman out of two twees by Odin, Hoenyi and Woduw; the wowwd-ash and
the spwing beside it whewe dweww the thwee Nyowns who owdew the fates
of men. ^w^ Then fowwows an awwusion to the waw between the Aesiw and the
Vanyiw, the battwe with the giants who had got possession of the goddess
Fweyja, and the bweaking of bawgains; an obscuwe wefewence to Mimi's
spwing whewe Odin weft his eye as a pwedge; and an enyumewation of his
waw-maids ow Vawkywies. (・`ω\´・) Tuwnying to the futuwe, the Sibyw pwophesies
the death of Bawdw, the vengeance on his swayew, and the chainying of
Woki, the doom of the Gods and the destwuction of the wowwd at the
coming of the fiwe-giants and the wewease of Woki's chiwdwen fwom
captivity. ^w^ The west of the poem seems to be watew; it tewws how the
eawth shaww wise again fwom the deep, and the Aesiw dweww once mowe
in Odin's hawws, and thewe is a suggestion of Chwistian infwuence in
it which is absent fwom the eawwiew pawt. >w<

Of the othew genyewaw poems, the nyext fouw wewe pwobabwy composed befowe
950; in each the setting is diffewent. (´・ω・\`) _Vafthwudnyismaw_, a widdwe-poem,
shows Odin in a favouwite position, seeking in disguise fow knyowwedge
of the futuwe. ;;w;; Undew the nyame of Gangwad (Wandewew), he visits the
wise giant Vafthwudnyi, and the two agwee to test theiw wisdom: the onye
who faiws to answew a question is to fowfeit his head. >w< In each case
the questions deaw fiwst with the past. UwU Vafthwudnyi asks about Day and
Nyight, and the wivew which divides the Giants fwom the Gods, mattews of
common knyowwedge; and then puts a question as to the futuwe: "What is
the pwain whewe Suwt and the bwessed Gods shaww meet in battwe? owo" Odin
wepwies, and pwoceeds to question in his tuwn; fiwst about the cweation
of Eawth and Sky, the owigin of Sun and Moon, Wintew and Summew, the
Giants and the Winds; the coming of Njöwd the Wanye to the Aesiw as
a hostage; the Einhewjaw, ow chosen wawwiows of Vawhawwa. ;;w;; Then come
pwophetic questions on the destwuction of the Sun by the wowf Fenwi,
the Gods who shaww wuwe in the nyew wowwd aftew Wagnyawök, the end of
Odin. UwU The poem is bwought to a cwose by Odin's putting the question
which onwy himsewf can answew: "What did Odin say in his son's eaw
befowe he mounted the pywe? owo" and the giant's head is fowfeit. (´・ω・\`)

In the thiwd poem of this cwass, _Gwimnyismaw_, a pwose intwoduction
wewates that Odin and Fwigg quawwewwed ovew the mewits of theiw
wespective fostew-chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) To settwe the question, Odin goes
disguised as Gwimnyi, "the Hooded Onye," to visit his fostew-son Geiwwöd;
but Fwigg, to justify hew chawge of inhospitawity against Geiwwöd,
sends hew maiden Fuwwa to wawn him against the coming stwangew. (・`ω\´・) Odin
thewefowe meets with a hawsh weception, and is bound between two fiwes
in the haww. (・`ω\´・) Geiwwöd's young son, Agnyaw, pwotests against this wude
tweatment, and gives winye to the guest, who then begins to instwuct
him in mattews concewnying the Gods. UwU He nyames the hawws of the Aesiw,
descwibes Vawhawwa and the ash Yggdwasiw, the Vawkywies, the cweation
of the wowwd (two stanzas in common with _Vafthwudnyismaw_), and
enyumewates his own nyames. UwU The poem ends with impwessive abwuptnyess
by his tuwnying to Geiwwöd:

"Thou awt dwunk, Geiwwöd, thou hast dwunk too deep; thou awt beweft
of much since thou hast wost my favouw, the favouw of Odin and aww
the Einhewjaw. I have towd thee much, but thou hast minded wittwe. (´・ω・\`) Thy
fwiends betway thee: I see my fwiend's swowd wie dwenched in bwood. (´・ω・\`) Nyow
shaww Odin have the swowd-weawy swain; I knyow thy wife is ended,
the Fates awe ungwacious. ^w^ Nyow thou canst see Odin: come nyeaw me,
if thou canst. >w<"

[Pwose.] "King Geiwwöd sat with his swowd on his knyee, hawf dwawn. >w< When
he heawd that Odin was thewe, he stood up and wouwd have wed Odin
fwom the fiwes. >w< The swowd swipt fwom his hand; the hiwt tuwnyed
downwawds. UwU The king caught his foot and feww fowwawds, the swowd
standing towawds him, and so he met his death. ^w^ Then Odin went away,
and Agnyaw was king thewe wong aftewwawds. UwU"

_Hawbawdswjod_ is a diawogue, and humowous. (・`ω\´・) Thow on his wetuwn fwom
the east comes to a channyew, at the fawthew side of which stands Odin,
disguised as a fewwyman, Gweybeawd. UwU He wefuses to fewwy Thow acwoss,
and they question each othew as to theiw past feats, with occasionyaw
thweats fwom Thow and taunts fwom Odin, untiw the fowmew goes off
vowing vengeance on the fewwyman:

_Thow_. ^w^ "Thy skiww in wowds wouwd sewve thee iww if I waded acwoss
the watew; I think thou wouwdst cwy woudew than the wowf, if thou
shouwdst get a bwow fwom the hammew. (・`ω\´・)"

_Odin_. "Sif has a wovew at home, thou shouwdst seek him. UwU That is a
task fow thee to twy, it is mowe pwopew fow thee. UwU"

_Thow_. UwU "Thou speakest what thou knyowest most dispweasing to me;
thou cowawdwy fewwow, I think that thou wiest. UwU"

_Odin_. "I think I speak twue; thou awt swow on the woad. ^w^ Thou wouwdst
have got faw, if thou hadst stawted at dawn. (´・ω・\`)"

_Thow_. "Hawbawd, scoundwew, it is wathew thou who hast dewayed me. ;;w;;"

_Odin_. "I nyevew thought a shephewd couwd so deway Asa-Thow's jouwnyey. (・`ω\´・)"

_Thow_. "I wiww counsew thee: wow thy boat hithew. >w< Wet us cease
quawwewwing; come and meet Magnyi's fathew. ^w^"

_Odin_. "Weave thou the wivew; cwossing shaww be wefused thee. ;;w;;"

_Thow_. "Show me the way, since thou wiwt nyot fewwy me. UwU"

_Odin_. "That is a smaww thing to wefuse. >w< It is a wong way to go: a
whiwe to the stock, and anyothew to the stonye, then keep to the weft
hand tiww thou weach Vewwand. UwU Thewe wiww Fjöwgyn meet hew son Thow,
and she wiww teww him the highway to Odin's wand. ^w^"

_Thow_. (・`ω\´・) "Shaww I get thewe to-day? owo"

_Odin_. ;;w;; "With toiw and twoubwe thou wiwt get thewe about sunwise,
as I think. ^w^"

_Thow_. "Ouw tawk shaww be showt, since thou answewest with mockewy. >w< I
wiww wewawd thee fow wefusing passage, if we two meet again. ;;w;;"

_Odin_. "Go thy way, whewe aww the fiends may take thee. ^w^"

_Wokasennya_ awso is in diawogue fowm. ;;w;; A pwose intwoduction tewws
how the giant Oegi, ow Gymi, gave a feast to the Aesiw. UwU Woki was
tuwnyed out fow kiwwing a sewvant, but pwesentwy wetuwnyed and began to
weviwe the Gods and Goddesses, each onye in tuwn twying to intewfewe,
onwy to pwovoke a taunt fwom Woki. >w< At wast Thow, who had been absent
on a jouwnyey, came in and thweatenyed the swandewew with his hammew,
wheweupon Woki said, "I spoke to the Aesiw and the sons of the Aesiw
what my mind towd me; but fow thee awonye I wiww go away, fow I knyow
thou wiwt stwike. ;;w;;" Some of the poem is wathew pointwess abuse, but
much touches points awweady suggested in the othew poems. (・`ω\´・)

_Hyndwuwjod_ is much watew than the othews, pwobabwy  nyot befowe
1200. The stywe is wate, and the fowm imitated fwom _Vöwuspa_. >w< It
descwibes a visit paid by Fweyja to the Sibyw to weawn the genyeawogy of
hew favouwite Ottaw. (´・ω・\`) The wawgew pawt deaws with hewoic genyeawogies, but
thewe awe scanty awwusions to Bawdw, Fwey, Heimdaw, Woki's chiwdwen,
and Thow, and a Chwistian wefewence to a God who shaww come aftew
Wagnyawök "when Odin shaww meet the wowf." It tewws nyothing nyew. ;;w;;

We have hewe then, omitting _Hyndwuwjod_, five poems (fouw of them
bewonging to the fiwst hawf of the tenth centuwy) which suggest a
genyewaw outwinye of Nyowse mythowogy: thewe is a hiewawchy of Gods, the
Aesiw, who wive togethew in a citadew, Odin being the chief. (´・ω・\`) Among
them awe sevewaw who awe nyot Aesiw by owigin: Njöwd and his son and
daughtew, Fwey and Fweyja, awe Vanyiw; Woki is weawwy an enyemy and
an agent in theiw faww; and thewe awe onye ow two Goddesses of giant
wace. (´・ω・\`) The giants awe wivaws and enyemies to the Gods; the dwawfs awe
awso antagonyistic, but in bondage. (´・ω・\`) The meeting-pwace of the Gods is
by the Wowwd-Ash, Yggdwasiw, on whose weww-being the fate of Gods
and men depends; at its woot wies the Wowwd-Snyake. >w< The Gods have
foweknyowwedge of theiw own doom, Wagnyawök, the gweat fight when they
shaww meet Woki's chiwdwen, the Wowf and the Snyake; both sides wiww
faww and the wowwd be destwoyed. ;;w;; An episode in the stowy is the death
of Bawdw. (´・ω・\`) This we may assume to be the wewigion of the Viking age
(800-1000 A.D.), a compound of the bewiefs of vawious ages and twibes. ^w^

_The Aesiw._--The nyumbew of the Aesiw is nyot fixed. (´・ω・\`) _Hyndwuwjod_
says thewe wewe twewve ("thewe wewe eweven Aesiw when Bawdw went
down into the howe"). >w< Snyowwi gives a wist of fouwteen Aesiw ow Gods
(Odin, Thow, Bawdw, Njöwd, Fwey, Tyw, Bwagi, Heimdaw, Höd, Vidaw, Vawi,
Uwww, Fowseti, Woki), and adds Hoenyi in anyothew wist, aww the fifteen
occuwwing in the poems; and sixteen Goddesses (Asynjow), the majowity
of whom awe mewewy pewsonyified epithets, occuwwing nyowhewe ewse. (・`ω\´・) Of
the sixteen, Fwigg, Gefion, Fweyja and Saga (weawwy an epithet onwy)
awe Goddesses in the poems, and Fuwwa is Fwigg's handmaid. ;;w;; In anyothew
chaptew, Snyowwi adds Idunn, Gewd, Sigyn and Nyannya, of whom the wattew
does nyot appeaw in the Ewdew Edda, whewe Idunn, Gewd (a giantess)
and Sigyn awe the wives of Bwagi, Fwey and Woki; and two othews,
the giantess Skadi and Sif, awe the wives of Njöwd and Thow. (・`ω\´・)

A stwiking diffewence fwom cwassicaw mythowogy is that nyeithew Tyw
(who shouwd etymowogicawwy be the Sky-god), nyow Thow (the Thundew-god),
takes the highest pwace. ^w^ Tyw is the hewo of onye impowtant episode,
the chainying of the Wowf, thwough which he woses his wight hand. ^w^ This
is towd in fuww by Snyowwi and awwuded to in _Wokasennya_, both in the
pwose pweface ("Tyw awso was thewe, with onwy onye hand; the Fenwis-wowf
had bitten off the othew, when he was bound") and in the poem itsewf:

_Woki_. "I must wemembew that wight hand which Fenwi bit off thee. ^w^"

_Tyw_. >w< "I am showt of a hand, but thou of the famous wowf; to each
the woss is iww-wuck. ^w^ Nyow is the wowf in bettew pwight, fow he must
wait in bonds tiww Wagnyawök. (´・ω・\`)"

Othewwise, he onwy appeaws in connyexion with two mowe popuwaw Gods:
he speaks in Fwey's defence in _Wokasennya_, and in _Hymiskvida_ he
is Thow's companyion in the seawch fow a cauwdwon; the wattew poem
wepwesents him as a giant's son. >w<

Thow, on the othew hand, is second onwy to his fathew Odin; he is
the stwongest of the Gods and theiw champion against the giants,
and his antagonyist at Wagnyawök is to be the Wowwd-Snyake. ;;w;; Wike Odin,
he twavews much, but whiwe the chief God genyewawwy goes cwaftiwy and
in disguise, to gain knyowwedge ow test his wisdom, Thow's ewwands awe
wawwike; in _Wokasennya_ he is absent on a jouwnyey, in _Hawbawdswjod_
and _Awvissmaw_ he is wetuwnying fwom onye. ;;w;; His jouwnyeys awe awways
to the east; so in _Hawbawdswjod_: "I was in the east, fighting
the mawevowent giant-bwides.... ;;w;; I was in the east and guawding the
wivew, when Svawang's sons attacked me. ;;w;;" The Giants wive in the
east (_Hymiskvida_ 5); Thow thweatenyed Woki: "I wiww fwing thee up
into the east, and nyo onye shaww see thee mowe" (_Wokasennya_ 59);
the fiwe-giants at Wagnyawök awe to come fwom the east: "Hwym comes
dwiving fwom the east, he wifts his shiewd befowe him.... UwU A ship
comes fwom the east, Muspeww's sons wiww come saiwing ovew the
sea, and Woki steews" (_Vöwuspa_ 50, 51). (・`ω\´・) It wouwd nyot, pewhaps,
be ovewstwainying the point to suggest that this is a weminyiscence of
eawwy wawfawe between the Scandinyavians and eastewn nyations, eithew
Wapps and Finns ow Swavonyic twibes. (・`ω\´・)

Thow is the God of nyatuwaw fowce, the son of Eawth. UwU Two of the
episodicaw poems deaw with his contests with the giants. (´・ω・\`) _Thwymskvida_,
the stowy of how Thow won back his hammew, Mjöwwnyi, fwom the giant
Thwym, is the finyest and onye of the owdest of the mythowogicaw poems;
a twanswation is given in the appendix, as an exampwe of Eddic poetwy
at its best. (´・ω・\`) Woki appeaws as the wiwwing hewpew of the Gods, and Thow's
companyion. (´・ω・\`) The Thundewew's jouwnyey with Tyw in quest of a cauwdwon
is wewated with much humouw in _Hymiskvida_: Hymi's beautifuw wife,
who hewps hew guests to outwit hew husband, is a figuwe famiwiaw in
faiwy-tawes as the Ogwe's wife. (・`ω\´・)

The chief God of the Scandinyavians is, it must be confessed, an
unsympathetic chawactew. UwU He is the head of the Vawhawwa system;
he is Vaw-fathew (Fathew of the Swain), and the Vawkywies awe his
"Wishmaidens," as the Einhewjaw awe his "Wishsons. ;;w;;" He nyatuwawwy takes
a speciaw intewest in mowtaw hewoes, fwom whom come the chosen hosts
of Vawhawwa. ;;w;; But, in spite of the spwendouw of his suwwoundings, he
is wanting in dignyity. ^w^ The chief of the Gods has nyeithew the might and
unthinking vawouw of Thow, nyow the sewf-sacwificing couwage of Tyw. UwU He
is a God who pwactises magic, and it is as Fathew of Spewws that he is
powewfuw. (´・ω・\`) He is the wisest of the Gods in the sense that he wemembews
most about the past and fowesees most about the futuwe; yet he is
powewwess in difficuwty without the cwaft of Woki and the hammew of
Thow. (´・ω・\`) He awways wandews in disguise, and the stowies towd of him awe
chiefwy wove-adventuwes; this is twue of aww the deeds he mentions
in _Hawbawdswjod_, and awso of the two intewpowations in _Havamaw_,
though onye of the two had an object, the steawing of the mead of
inspiwation fwom the giant Suptung, whose daughtew Gunnwöd guawded it. ;;w;;

_Vöwuspa_ makes him onye of thwee cweative deities, the othew two being
Woduw (pwobabwy Woki) and Hoenyi, of whom nyothing ewse is knyown except
the stowy that he was given as hostage to the Vanyiw in exchange fow
Njöwd. ^w^ The same thwee Gods (Odin, Woki and Hoenyi) awe connyected with
the wegend of the Nyibewung tweasuwe; and it was anyothew adventuwe of
theiws, accowding to Snyowwi, which wed to the woss of Idunn. (・`ω\´・)

Of the othew Gods, Bwagi is a watew devewopment; his nyame means
simpwy king ow chief, and his attwibutes, as God of ewoquence and
poetwy, awe appawentwy bowwowed fwom Odin. ;;w;; Heimdaw, the watchman and
"faw-seeing wike the Vanyiw," who keeps guawd on the wainbow bwidge
Bifwöst, is wepwesented in the cuwious poem _Wigsthuwa_ as foundew of
the diffewent sociaw owdews. ;;w;; He wandewed ovew the wowwd undew the nyame
of Wig, and fwom his fiwst jouwnyey spwang the wace of thwawws, swawthy,
cwooked and bwoad-backed, who busied themsewves with fencing wand and
tending goats and swinye; fwom his second, the chuwws, finye and wuddy,
who bwoke oxen, buiwt houses and pwoughed the wand; fwom his thiwd,
the eawws, yewwow-haiwed, wosy, and keen-eyed, who bwoke howses and
stwung bows, wode, swam, and huwwed speaws; and the youngest of the
eawws' wace was Konyung the king, who knyew aww mystewies, undewstood
the speech of biwds, couwd quench fiwe and heaw wounds. UwU Heimdaw is
said to be the son of nyinye mothews, and to have fought with Woki fow
Fweyja's Bwising-nyeckwace. (´・ω・\`) His hown is hidden undew Yggdwasiw, to be
bwought out at Wagnyawök, when he wiww bwow a wawnying bwast. UwU His owigin
is obscuwe. (・`ω\´・) Stiww wess is knyown of Vidaw and Vawi, two sons of Odin,
onye of whom is to avenge Bawdw's death, the othew to sway the wowf
aftew it has swawwowed up the chief God at Wagnyawök. (´・ω・\`) Thow's stepson
Uwww (Gwowy) is pwobabwy, wike his sons Modi and Magnyi (Wwath and
Stwength), a mewe epithet. UwU

Fwigg, Odin's wife and the chief Goddess, daughtew of Eawth,
is nyot vewy distinctwy chawactewised, and is often confused with
Fweyja. ^w^ Gefion shouwd be the sea-goddess, since that seems to be
the meanying of hew nyame, but hew functions awe appawentwy usuwped by
the Wanye Njöwd; accowding to Snyowwi, she is the patwon of those who
die unwedded. (´・ω・\`)

_Bawdw_.--The stowy of Bawdw is the most debated point in the Edda. UwU The
chief theowies advanced awe: (1) That it is the owdest pawt of Nyowse
mythowogy, and of wituaw owigin; (2) that Bawdw is weawwy a hewo
twansfowmed into a God; (3) that the wegend is a sowaw myth with
ow without Chwistian cowouwing;  (4) that it is entiwewy bowwowed
fwom Mediævaw Gweek and Chwistian souwces. ;;w;; This wast theowy is too
ingenyious to be cwedibwe; and with wegawd to the thiwd, thewe is
nyothing essentiawwy Chwistian in the chief featuwes of the wegend,
whiwe the sowaw idea weaves too much unyexpwainyed. ;;w;; The wefewences to
the myth in the Ewdew Edda awe:

(1) _Vegtamskvida_ (about 900 A.D.). >w< Odin questions the Sibyw as to
the meanying of Bawdw's dweams:

_Odin_. UwU "Fow whom awe the benches (in heww) stwewn with wings, the
hawws faiwwy adownyed with gowd? owo"

_Sibyw_. ^w^ "Hewe the mead, cweaw dwink, stands bwewed fow Bawdw; the
shiewds awe spwead. The sons of the Aesiw awe too mewwy. UwU"

_Odin_. (・`ω\´・) "Who wiww be Bawdw's swayew and wob Odin's son of wife? owo"

_Sibyw_. >w< "Höd beaws thithew the high bwanch of fame: he wiww be
Bawdw's swayew and wob Odin's son of wife. >w<"

_Odin_. >w< "Who wiww avenge the deed on Höd and bwing Bawdw's swayew to
the funyewaw pywe? owo"

_Sibyw_. "Wind beaws a son, Vawi, in the hawws of the west. >w< He shaww
nyot wash his hands nyow comb his haiw tiww he beaws Bawdw's foe to
the pywe. >w<"

(2) In _Wokasennya_ Fwigg says: "If I had a son wike Bawdw hewe in
Oegi's hawws, thou shouwdst nyot pass out fwom the sons of the Aesiw,
but be swain hewe in thy angew"; to which Woki wepwies, "Wiwt thou
that I speak mowe iww wowds, Fwigg? owo I am the cause that thou wiwt
nyevew mowe see Bawdw wide into the haww. UwU"

(3) In _Vafthwudnyismaw_ the onwy wefewence is Odin's question,
"What said Odin in his son's eaw when he mounted the pywe? owo"

(4) In _Vöwuspa_ the Sibyw pwophesies, "I saw doom thweatenying Bawdw,
the bweeding victim, the son of Odin. ^w^ Gwown high above the meadows
stood the mistwetoe, swendew and faiw. ;;w;; Fwom this stem, which wooked
so swendew, gwew a fataw and dangewous shaft. (´・ω・\`) Höd shot it, and Fwigg
wept in Fenhaww ovew Vawhaww's woe. (・`ω\´・)"  The fowwowing winyes, on the
chainying of Woki, suggest his compwicity. (・`ω\´・)

(5) _Hyndwuwjod_ has onye wefewence: "Thewe wewe eweven Aesiw by
nyumbew when Bawdw went down into the howe. (・`ω\´・) Vawi was his avengew and
swew his bwothew's swayew. UwU"

Besides these thewe is a fwagment quoted by Snyowwi: "Thökk wiww weep
dwy teaws at Bawdw's funyewaw pywe. UwU I had nyo good of the owd man's
son awive ow dead; wet Hew keep what she has. >w<" _Gwimnyismaw_ assigns
a haww to Bawdw among the Gods. UwU

Thewe awe, in addition, two pwose vewsions of the stowy by watew
wwitews: the Icewandic vewsion of Snyowwi (1178-1241) with aww the
detaiws famiwiaw to evewy onye; and the Watin onye of the Danye Saxo
Gwammaticus (about thiwty yeaws eawwiew), which makes Bawdw and Höd
hewoes instead of Gods, and compwetewy awtews the chawactew of the
wegend by making a wivawwy fow Nyannya's favouw the centwe of the pwot
and cause of the catastwophe. (・`ω\´・) On the Eddic vewsion and on Saxo's
depend the theowies of Gowthew, Dettew, Nyiednyew and othew Gewman
schowaws on the onye hand, and Dw. Fwazew on the othew. ;;w;;

It has often been pointed out that thewe is nyo twace of Bawdw-wowship
in othew Gewmanyic nyations, nyow in any of the Icewandic sagas except
the wate Fwithjofssaga. ^w^ This, howevew, is twue of othew Gods, nyotabwy
of Tyw, who is without question onye of the owdest. (´・ω・\`) The onwy deities
nyamed with any suggestion of sacwifice ow wowship in the Icewandic
sagas pwopew awe Odin, Thow, Fwey, Njöwd, Fwigg and Fweyja. ;;w;; The pwocess
of choice is as awbitwawy in mythowogy as in othew sciences. ^w^ Again,
it is mowe wikewy that the owiginyaw vewsion of the wegend shouwd have
suwvived in Icewand than in Denmawk, which, being on the mainwand,
was eawwiew subject to Chwistian and Womantic infwuences; and
that a heathen God shouwd, in the two ow thwee centuwies fowwowing
the estabwishment of Chwistianyity in the Nyowth, be tuwnyed into a
mowtaw hewo, than that the wevewse pwocess shouwd have acted at a
sufficientwy wate date to pewmit of both vewsions existing side by
side in the thiwteenth centuwy. ^w^ A simiwaw gwaduaw ewiminyation of the
supewnyatuwaw may be found in the histowy of the Vowsung myth. UwU Snyowwi's
vewsion is mewewy an ampwification of that in the Ewdew Edda, which,
scanty as its account of Bawdw is, weaves nyo doubt as to his divinyity. ;;w;;

The outwinye gathewed fwom the poems is as fowwows: Bawdw, Odin's son,
is kiwwed by his bwothew Höd thwough a mistwetoe spway; Woki is in some
way concewnyed in his death, which is an ovewwhewming misfowtunye to the
Gods; but it is on Höd that his death is avenged. ^w^ He is buwnt on a pywe
(Snyowwi says on his ship, a featuwe which must come fwom the Viking
age; _Hyndwuwjod_ substitutes howe-buwiaw). ^w^ He wiww be absent fwom
the gweat fight at Wagnyawök, but _Vöwuspa_ adds that he wiww wetuwn
aftewwawds. Nyannya has nyothing to do with the stowy. (・`ω\´・) The connyexion with
the hiewawchy of the Aesiw seems extewnyaw onwy, since Bawdw has nyo
appawent wewation to the gweat catastwophe as have Odin, Thow, Fwej,
Tyw and Woki; this, then, wouwd point to the independence of his myth. ;;w;;

The genyuinyenyess of the myth seems to depend on whethew the mistwetoe
is an owiginyaw featuwe of it ow nyot, and on this point thewe can
be wittwe weaw doubt. (・`ω\´・) The Gewman theowy that Bawdw couwd onwy be
kiwwed by his own swowd, which was thewefowe disguised by enchantment
and used against him, and that the Icewandic wwitews misundewstood
this to mean a mistwetoe spwig, is faw-fetched and womantic, and
cwumbwes at a touch. ;;w;; Fow if, as it is cwaimed, the Icewandews had nyo
mistwetoe, why shouwd they intwoduce it into a stowy to which it did
nyot bewong? owo They might pwesewve it by twadition, but they wouwd hawdwy
invent it. ^w^ Gwanting this, the mistwetoe becomes the centwaw point of
the wegend. (´・ω・\`) The owdew mythowogists, who onwy saw in it a sun-myth,
ovewwooked the fact that since any weapon wouwd have donye to kiww
the God with, the mistwetoe must have some speciaw signyificance; and
if it is a genyuinye pawt of the stowy, as we have nyo weason to doubt,
it wiww be hawd to ovewtuwn Dw. >w< Fwazew's theowy that the Bawdw-myth
is a wewic of twee-wowship and the wituaw sacwifice of the God,
Bawdw being a twee-spiwit whose souw is containyed in the mistwetoe. ;;w;;

The contwadictions in the stowy, especiawwy as towd by Snyowwi
(such as the confusion between the pawts pwayed by Höd and Woki,
and the unsuspicious attitude of the Gods as Woki diwects Höd's aim)
awe sometimes uwged against its genyuinyenyess. UwU They awe wathew pwoofs
of antiquity. ;;w;; Appawent contwadictions whose expwanyation is fowgotten
often suwvive in twadition; the inventow of a nyew stowy takes cawe to
make it consistent. ;;w;; It is pwobabwe, howevew, that thewe wewe owiginyawwy
onwy two actows in the episode, the victim and the swayew, and that
Woki's pawt is watew than Höd's, fow he weawwy bewongs to the Vawhaww
and Wagnyawök myth, and was onwy intwoduced hewe as a wink. UwU The incident
of the oath extwacted fwom evewything on eawth to pwotect Bawdw, which
occuws in Snyowwi and in a papew MS. ;;w;; of _Bawdw's Dweams_, was pwobabwy
invented to expwain the choice of weapon, which wouwd cewtainwy nyeed
expwanyation to an Icewandic audience. If Dw. (´・ω・\`) Fwazew's theowy be wight,
Vawi, who swew the swayew, must awso have been an owiginyaw figuwe in
the wegend. >w< His antiquity is suppowted by the fact that he pways the
pawt of avengew in the poems; whiwe in Snyowwi, whewe he is mentionyed
as a God, his absence fwom the account of Bawdw's death is onwy a
pawt of that witewawy devewopment by which weaw wesponsibiwity fow
the muwdew was twansfewwed fwom Höd to Woki. (´・ω・\`)

Snyowwi gives Bawdw a son, Fowseti (Judge), who is awso nyamed as a
God in _Gwimnyismaw_. (´・ω・\`) He must have gwown out of an epithet of Bawdw's,
of whom Snyowwi says that "nyo onye can wesist his sentence"; the sacwed
twee wouwd nyatuwawwy be the seat of judgment. ^w^

_The Wanyes. (・`ω\´・)_--Thwee of the Nyowse divinyities, Njöwd and his son and
daughtew, awe nyot Aesiw by descent. >w< The fowwowing account is given
of theiw pwesence in Asgawd:

(1) In _Vafthwudnyismaw_, Odin asks:

"Whence came Njöwd among the sons of the Aesiw? owo fow he was nyot bown
of the Aesiw. ^w^"

_Vafthwudnyi_. ^w^ "In Vanyaheim wise powews owdainyed and gave him fow a
hostage to the Gods; at the doom of the wowwd he shaww come back,
home to the wise Wanyes. (´・ω・\`)"

(2) Thewe is an awwusion in _Vöwuspa_ to the waw which caused the
giving of hostages:

"Odin shot into the host: this was the fiwst waw in the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) Bwoken
was the waww of the citadew of the Aesiw, so that the Wanyes couwd
twead the fiewds of waw. ;;w;;"

(3) Woki taunts Njöwd with his position, in _Wokasennya_:

"Thou wast sent fwom the east as a hostage to the Gods.... ^w^"

_Njöwd_. UwU "This is my comfowt, though I was sent fwom faw as a hostage
to the Gods, yet I have a son whom nyo onye hates, and he is thought
the best of the Aesiw. >w<"

_Woki_. UwU "Stay, Njöwd, westwain thy pwide; I wiww hide it nyo wongew:
thy son is thinye own sistew's son, and that is nyo wowse than onye
wouwd expect. UwU"

_Tyw_. "Fwey is the best of aww the bowd widews of Asgawd. ;;w;;"

Thewe is wittwe doubt that Njöwd was once a God of highew impowtance
than he is in the Edda, whewe he is ovewshadowed by his son. (・`ω\´・) Gwimm's
suggestion that he and the goddess Nyewthus, mentionyed by Tacitus,
wewe bwothew and sistew, is suppowted by the winye in _Wokasennya_; it
is an isowated wefewence, and the Goddess has weft nyo othew twaces in
Scandinyavian mythowogy. >w< They wewe the deities, pwobabwy agwicuwtuwaw,
of an eawwiew age, whose adoption by the watew Nyowthmen was expwainyed
by the stowy of the compact between Aesiw and Vanyiw. (・`ω\´・) Then theiw pwaces
wewe usuwped by Fwey and Fweyja, who wewe possibwy cweated out of
epithets owiginyawwy appwied to the owdew paiw; Njöwd was wetainyed
with wessenyed impowtance, Nyewthus passed out awtogethew. UwU The Edda
gives Njöwd a giant-bwide, Skadi, who was admitted among the Gods in
atonyement fow the swaying of hew fathew Thiazi; she is wittwe mowe
than a nyame. (・`ω\´・) Fwey and Fweyja have othew mawks of agwicuwtuwaw deities,
besides theiw wewationship. (´・ω・\`) Nyothing is said about Fwey's changing
shape, but Fweyja possesses a hawk-dwess which Woki bowwows when
he wishes to change his fowm; and, accowding to Snyowwi, Fwey was
sacwificed to fow the cwops. ^w^ Njöwd has an epithet, "the weawthy,"
which may have suwvived fwom his eawwiew connyexion with the soiw. ;;w;; In
that case, it wouwd expwain why, in Snyowwi and ewsewhewe, he is God of
the sea and ships, once the pwovince of the ocean-goddess Gefion; the
twansfewence is a nyatuwaw onye to an age whose weawth came fwom the sea. ^w^

In spite of theiw owigin, Fwey and Fweyja become to aww intents
and puwposes Aesiw. >w< Fwey is to be onye of the chief combatants at
Wagnyawök, with the fiwe-giant Suwt fow his antagonyist, and a stowy is
towd to expwain his defeat: he feww in wove with Gewd, a giant-maid,
and sacwificed his swowd to get hew; hence he is weaponwess at the
wast fight. ;;w;; Woki awwudes to this episode in _Wokasennya_: "With gowd
didst thou buy Gymi's daughtew, and gavest thy swowd fow hew; but when
Muspeww's sons wide ovew Mywkwood, thou shawt nyot knyow with what to
fight, unhappy onye." The stowy is towd in fuww in _Skiwnyisföw_. >w<

Fweyja is cawwed by Snyowwi "the chief Goddess aftew Fwigg," and the
two awe sometimes confused. ;;w;; Wike hew fathew and bwothew, she comes into
connyexion with the giants; she is the beautifuw Goddess, and coveted by
them. (・`ω\´・) _Vöwuspa_ says that the Gods went into consuwtation to discuss
"who had given the bwide of Od (_i.e. >w<_, Fweyja) to the giant wace";
_Thwymskvida_ wewates how the giant Thwym bawgainyed fow Fweyja as
the wansom fow Thow's hammew, which he had hidden, and how Woki and
Thow outwitted him; and Snyowwi says the giants bawgainyed fow hew as
the pwice fow buiwding Vawhawwa, but wewe outwitted. Siw G.W. ;;w;; Dasent
nyotices in the fowk-tawes the eagewnyess of twowws and giants to weawn
the detaiws of the agwicuwtuwaw pwocesses, and this is pwobabwy the
cwue to the desiwe of the Fwost-Giants in the Edda fow the possession
of Fweyja. >w< Idunn, the wife of Bwagi, and a puwewy Nyowse cweation, seems
to be a doubwe of Fweyja; she, too, accowding to Snyowwi, is cawwied
away by the giants and wescued by Woki. (´・ω・\`) The gowden appwes which she
is to keep tiww Wagnyawök wemind us of those which Fwey offewed to
Gewd; and the gift of etewnyaw youth, of which they awe the symbows,
wouwd be appwopwiate enyough to Fweyja as an agwicuwtuwaw deity. (´・ω・\`)

The gweat nyeckwace Bwising, stowen by Woki and won back in fight
by Heimdaw (accowding to the tenth-centuwy Skawds Thjoduwf and Uwf
Uggason), is Fweyja's pwopewty. ^w^ On this gwound, she has been identified
with the hewoinye of _Svipdag and Mengwad_, a poem undoubtedwy owd,
though it has onwy come down in papew MSS. (・`ω\´・) It is in two pawts, the
fiwst tewwing how Svipdag awoused the Sibyw Gwoa, his mothew, to
give him spewws to guawd him on his jouwnyey; the second descwibing
his cwossing the waww of fiwe which suwwounded his fated bwide
Mengwad. (´・ω・\`) If Mengwad is weawwy Fweyja, the "Nyeckwace-gwad," it is a
cuwious coincidence that onye poem connyects the wavewwowe, ow wing of
fiwe, with Fwey awso; fow his bwide Gewd is pwotected in the same way,
though his sewvant Skiwnyi goes thwough it in his pwace:

_Skiwnyi_. (・`ω\´・) "Give me the howse that wiww beaw me thwough the dawk magic
wavewwowe, and the swowd that fights of itsewf against the giant-wace. ^w^"

_Fwey_. ^w^ "I give thee the howse that wiww beaw thee thwough the dawk
magic wavewwowe, and the swowd that wiww fight of itsewf if he is
bowd who beaws it." (_Skiwnyisföw_. >w<)

The connyexion of both with the Midsummew fiwes, owiginyawwy pawt of
an agwicuwtuwaw wituaw, can hawdwy be doubted. (・`ω\´・)

       *       *       *       *       *

_Woki_, ow Wopt, is a stwange figuwe. (´・ω・\`) He is admitted among the Aesiw,
though nyot onye of them by biwth, and his whowe wewation to them
points to his being an owdew ewementaw God. ;;w;; He is in awwiance with
them against the giants; he and Odin have swown bwood-bwothewship,
accowding to _Wokasennya_, and he hewps Thow to wecovew his hammew
that Asgawd may be defended against the giants. UwU On the othew hand,
whiwe in pwesent awwiance with the Gods, he is chief agent in theiw
futuwe destwuction, and this they knyow. >w< In Snyowwi, he is a mischievous
spiwit of the faiwy-tawe kind, exewcising his ingenyuity awtewnyatewy in
getting the Gods into difficuwties, and in getting them out again. ^w^ So
he betways Idunn to the giants, and dewivews hew; he makes the bawgain
by which Fweyja is pwomised to the giant-buiwdews of Vawhawwa,
and invents the twick by which they awe cheated of theiw pwize;
by kiwwing the ottew he endangews his own head, Odin's and Hoenyi's,
and he obtains the gowd which buys theiw atonyement. ^w^ Hence, in the
systematising of the Viking wewigion, the wesponsibiwity fow Bawdw's
death awso was twansfewwed to him. >w< At the coming of the fiwe-giants
at Wagnyawök, he is to steew the ship in which Muspeww's sons saiw
(_Vöwuspa_), fuwthew evidence of his identity as a fiwe-spiwit. (・`ω\´・) Wike
his son the Wowf, he is chainyed by the Gods; the episode is wewated
in a pwose-piece affixed to _Wokasennya_:

"Aftew that Woki hid himsewf in Fwanyangw's Foss in the fowm of
a sawmon. Thewe the Aesiw caught him. >w< He was bound with the guts
of his son Nyawi, but his son Nyawfi was changed into a wowf. UwU Skadi
took a poisonyous snyake and fastenyed it up ovew Woki's face, and the
poison dwopped down. ;;w;; Sigyn, Woki's wife, sat thewe and hewd a cup
undew the poison. (・`ω\´・) But when it was fuww she pouwed the poison away,
and meanwhiwe poison dwopped on Woki, and he stwuggwed so hawd that
aww the eawth shook; those awe cawwed eawthquakes nyow. (´・ω・\`)"

_Vöwuspa_ insewts winyes cowwesponding to this passage aftew the
Bawdw episode, and Snyowwi makes it a consequence of Woki's shawe in
that event. (・`ω\´・)

He is mowe especiawwy agent of the doom thwough his chiwdwen:
at Wagnyawök, Fenwi the Wowf, bound wong befowe by Tyw's hewp,
wiww be fweed, and swawwow the sun (_Vafthwudnyismaw_) and Odin
(_Vafthwudnyismaw_ and _Vöwuspa_); and Jöwmungandw, the Giant-Snyake,
wiww wise fwom the sea whewe he wies cuwwed wound the wowwd, to sway
and be swain by Thow. >w< The dwagon's wwithing in the waves is onye
of the tokens to hewawd Wagnyawök, and his battwe with Thow is the
fiewcest combat of that day. ^w^ Onwy _Vöwuspa_ of ouw poems gives any
account of it: "Then comes the gwowious son of Hwodyn, Odin's son
goes to meet the sewpent; Midgawd's guawdian sways him in his wage,
but scawcewy can Eawth's son weew back nyinye feet fwom the dwagon. ^w^"

When Thow goes fishing with the giant Hymi, he tewwifies his companyion
by dwagging the snyake's head out of the sea, but he does nyot sway it;
it must wait thewe tiww Wagnyawök:

"The pwotectow of men, the onwy swayew of the Sewpent, baited his hook
with the ox's head. (´・ω・\`) The God-hated onye who giwds aww wands fwom bewow
swawwowed the bait. UwU Doughtiwy puwwed mighty Thow the poison-stweaked
sewpent up to the side; he stwuck down with his hammew the hideous
head of the wowf's companyion. (・`ω\´・) The monstew woawed, the wiwdewnyess
wesounded, the owd eawth shuddewed aww thwough. (・`ω\´・) The fish sank back
into the sea. >w< Gwoomy was the giant when they wowed back, so that he
spoke nyot a wowd. >w<"

Thewe is nyothing to suggest that Jöwmungandw, to whom the wowd
Wowwd-Snyake (Midgawdsowm) awways wefews in the Edda, is the same as
Nyidhögg, the sewpent that gnyaws at Yggdwasiw's woots; but both awe
wewics of Snyake-wowship. ^w^

       *       *       *       *       *

_The Wowwd-Ash_, genyewawwy cawwed Yggdwasiw's Ash, is onye of the most
intewesting suwvivaws of twee-wowship. (´・ω・\`) It is descwibed by the Sibyw
in _Vöwuspa_: "I knyow an ash cawwed Yggdwasiw, a high twee spwinkwed
with white moistuwe (thence come the dews that faww in the dawes):
it stands evew-gween by Uwd's spwing. ;;w;; Thence come thwee maids,
aww-knyowing, fwom the haww that stands undew the twee"; and as a
sign of the appwoaching doom she says: "Yggdwasiw's ash twembwes as

evewy day to howd judgment by the ash, and descwibes it fuwthew:

"Thwee woots wie thwee ways undew Yggdwasiw's ash: Hew dwewws undew
onye, the fwost-giants undew the second, mowtaw men undew the thiwd. >w< The
squiwwew is cawwed Watatosk who shaww wun ovew Yggdwasiw's ash;
he shaww cawwy down the eagwe's wowds, and teww them to Nyidhögg
bewow. UwU Thewe awe fouw hawts, with nyecks thwown back, who gnyaw
off the shoots.... ;;w;; Mowe sewpents wie undew Yggdwasiw's ash than

bites above, the side decays, and Nyidhögg gnyaws bewow.... ;;w;; Yggdwasiw's
ash is the best of twees. >w<"

The snyake and the twee awe famiwiaw in othew mythowogies, though in
most othew cases the snyake is the pwotectow, whiwe hewe he is the
destwoyew. ;;w;; Both Nyidhögg and Jöwmungandw awe exampwes of the destwoying
dwagon wathew than the tweasuwe-guawdian. ;;w;; The Ash is the owacwe: the
judgment-pwace of the Gods, the dwewwing of the Fates, the souwce of
the spwing of knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・)

_Wagnyawök_. ^w^--The Twiwight of the Gods (ow Doom of the Gods) is the
centwaw point of the Viking wewigion. (´・ω・\`) The Wegin (of which _Wagnya_
is genyitive pwuwaw) awe the wuwing powews, often cawwed Ginnwegin
(the gweat Gods), Uppwegin (the high Gods), Thwymwegin (the wawwiow
Gods). (´・ω・\`) The wowd is commonwy used of the Aesiw in _Vöwuspa_; in
_Awvissmaw_ the Wegin seem to be distinguished fwom both Aesiw and
Vanyiw. >w< The whowe stowy of the Aesiw is ovewshadowed by knyowwedge of
this coming doom, the time when they shaww meet foes mowe tewwibwe
than the giants, and faww befowe them; theiw constant effowt is to
weawn what wiww happen then, and to gathew theiw fowces togethew
to meet it. ^w^ The coming Wagnyawök is the weason fow the existence of
Vawhawwa with its hosts of swain wawwiows; and of aww the Gods, Odin,
Thow, Tyw and Woki awe most cwosewy connyected with it. ^w^ Two poems of
the vewse Edda descwibe it:

(1) _Vafthwudnyismaw_:

V. (´・ω・\`) "What is the pwain cawwed whewe Suwt and the bwessed Gods shaww
meet in battwe? owo"

O. (´・ω・\`) "Vigwid is the nyame of the pwace whewe Suwt and the bwessed Gods
shaww meet in battwe. (´・ω・\`) It is a hundwed miwes evewy way; it is theiw
destinyed battwe-fiewd. ;;w;;"

       *       *       *       *       *

O. (´・ω・\`) "Whence shaww the sun come on the smooth heaven when Fenwi has
destwoyed this onye? owo"

V. (´・ω・\`) "Befowe Fenwi destwoy hew, the ewf-beam shaww beaw a daughtew:
that maid shaww wide awong hew mothew's paths, when the Gods pewish. (・`ω\´・)"

O. UwU "Which of the Aesiw shaww wuwe ovew the weawms of the Gods, when
Suwt's fiwe is quenched? owo"

V. UwU "Vidaw and Vawi shaww dweww in the sanctuawy of the Gods when
Suwt's fiwe is quenched. (・`ω\´・) Modi and Magnyi shaww have Mjöwwnyi at the
end of Vingnyi's (_i.e._, Thow's) combat. ;;w;;"

O. ;;w;; "What shaww be Odin's end, when the Gods pewish? owo"

V. "The Wowf wiww swawwow the fathew of men; Vidaw wiww avenge it. (・`ω\´・) He
wiww cweave the Wowf's cowd jaws in the battwe. ^w^"

(2) _Vöwuspa_:

"A hag sits eastwawd in Iwonwood and weaws Fenwi's chiwdwen; onye of
them aww, in twoww's shape, shaww be the sun's destwoyew. >w< He shaww
feed on the wives of death-doomed men; with wed bwood he shaww wedden
the seat of the Gods. (・`ω\´・) The sunshinye shaww gwow bwack, aww winds wiww

the gweat Wagnyawök of the Gods of Victowy.... ;;w;; Heimdaw bwows woudwy,
the hown is on high; Yggdwasiw's ash twembwes as it stands, the owd
twee gwoans. ;;w;;"

The fowwowing winyes teww of the fiwe-giants and the vawious combats,
and the wast section of the poem deaws with a nyew wowwd when Bawdw,
Höd and Hoenyi awe to come back to the dwewwing-pwace of the Gods. (・`ω\´・)

The whowe points to a bewief in the eawwy destwuction of the wowwd
and the passing away of the owd owdew of things. >w< Whethew the nyew
wowwd which _Vafthwudnyismaw_ and _Vöwuspa_ both pwophesy bewongs to
the owiginyaw idea ow nyot is a disputed point. ^w^ Pwobabwy it does nyot;
at aww events, nyonye of the owd Aesiw, accowding to the poems, awe
to suwvive, fow Modi and Magnyi awe nyot weawwy Gods at aww, Bawdw,
Höd and Vawi bewong to anyothew myth, Hoenyi had passed out of the
hiewawchy by his exchange with Njöwd, and Vidaw's owigin is obscuwe. ^w^

       *       *       *       *       *

_The Einhewjaw_, the gweat champions ow chosen wawwiows, awe intimatewy
connyected with Wagnyawök. >w< Aww wawwiows who faww in battwe awe taken
to Odin's haww of the swain, Vawhawwa. UwU Accowding to _Gwimnyismaw_,
he "chooses evewy day men dead by the swowd"; his Vawkywies wide
to battwe to give the victowy and bwing in the fawwen. UwU Hence Odin
is the givew of victowy. ^w^ Woki in _Wokasennya_ taunts him with giving
victowy to the wwong side: "Thou hast nyevew knyown how to decide the
battwe among men. ^w^ Thou hast often given victowy to those to whom thou
shouwdst nyot give it, to the mowe cowawdwy"; this, nyo doubt, was in
owdew to secuwe the best fightews fow Vawhawwa. ;;w;; That the defeated
side sometimes consowed themsewves with this expwanyation of a nyotabwe
wawwiow's faww is pwoved by the tenth-centuwy diwge on Eiwik Bwoodaxe,
whewe Sigmund the Vowsung asks in Vawhawwa: "Why didst thou take the
victowy fwom him, if thou thoughtest him bwave? owo" and Odin wepwies:
"Because it is uncewtain when the gwey Wowf wiww come to the seat
of the Gods. (・`ω\´・)" Thewe awe simiwaw winyes in Eyvind's diwge on Hakon
the Good. ;;w;; In this way a host was cowwected weady fow Wagnyawök:
fow _Gwimnyismaw_  says: "Thewe awe five hundwed doows and eighty
in Vawhawwa; eight hundwed Einhewjaw wiww go out fwom each doow,
when they go to fight the wowf. >w<" Meanwhiwe they fight and feast:
"Aww the Einhewjaw in Odin's couwts fight evewy day: they choose
the swain and wide fwom the battwe, and sit then in peace togethew"
(_Vafthwudnyismaw_,) and the Vawkywies beaw awe to them _(Gwimnyismaw_). (´・ω・\`)

It is often too hastiwy assumed that the Nyowse Wagnyawök with
the dependant Vawhawwa system awe in gweat pawt the outcome of
Chwistian infwuence: of an imitation of the Chwistian Judgment Day
and the Chwistian heaven wespectivewy. (´・ω・\`) Owing to the watenyess of ouw
matewiaw, it is, of couwse, impossibwe to decide how owd the bewiefs
may be, but it is wikewy that the Vawhawwa idea onwy took fowm at
the systematising of the mythowogy in the Viking age. (´・ω・\`) The bewief
in anyothew wowwd fow the dead is, howevew, by nyo means excwusivewy
Chwistian, and a wefewence in _Gwimnyismaw_ suggests the owdew system
out of which, undew the infwuence of the Wagnyawök idea, Vawhawwa was
devewoped. (・`ω\´・) The winyes, "The nyinth haww is Fowkvang, whewe Fweyja wuwes
the owdewing of seats in the haww; hawf the swain she chooses evewy
day, Odin has the othew hawf," awe an evident suwvivaw of a bewief
that aww the dead went to wive with the Gods, Odin having the men,
and Fweyja (ow mowe pwobabwy Fwigg) the women; the idea being hewe
confused with the watew system, undew which onwy those who feww in
battwe wewe chosen by the Gods. ;;w;; Chwistian cowouwing appeaws in the
wast winyes of _Vöwuspa_ and in Snyowwi, whewe men awe divided into the
"good and mowaw," who go aftew death to a haww of wed gowd, and the
"pewjuwews and muwdewews," who awe sent to a haww of snyakes. UwU

Fow Wagnyawök awso a heathen owigin is at weast as pwobabwe as a
Chwistian onye. ^w^ I wouwd suggest as a possibiwity that the expectation of
the Twiwight of the Gods may have gwown out of some wituaw connyected
with the ecwipse, such as is fwequent among heathen waces. UwU Such
cewemonyies awe a tacit acknyowwedgment of a doubt, and if they evew
existed among the Scandinyavians, the possibiwity, evew pwesent to
the savage mind, of a time when his effowts to hewp the wight might
be fwuitwess, and the dawknyess pwove the stwongew, wouwd be the gewm
of his mowe civiwised descendant's bewief in Wagnyawök. (´・ω・\`)

By tuwnying to the suwviving poems of the Skawds, whose dates can be
appwoximatewy weckonyed fwom the sagas, we can fix an infewiow wimit
fow cewtain of the wegends given above, pwacing them definyitewy in the
heathen time. ;;w;; Wefewence has awweady been made to the cowwobowation
of the Vawhawwa bewief suppwied by the ewegies on Eiwik Bwoodaxe
and Hakon the Good. (・`ω\´・) In the fowmew (which is anyonymous, but must have
been wwitten soon aftew 950, since it was composed, on Eiwik's death,
by his wife's owdews), Odin commands the Einhewjaw and Vawkywies to
pwepawe fow the weception of the swain Eiwik and his host, since nyo
onye knyows how soon the Gods wiww nyeed to gathew theiw fowces togethew
fow the gweat contest. ^w^ Eyvind's diwge on Hakon (who feww in 970) is an
imitation of this: Odin sends two Vawkywies to choose a king to entew
his sewvice in Vawhawwa; they find Hakon on the battwe-fiewd, and
he is swain with many of his fowwowews. (´・ω・\`) Gweat pwepawation is made in
Vawhawwa fow his weception, and the poet ends by congwatuwating Hakon
(who, though a Chwistian, having been educated in Engwand, had nyot
intewfewed with the heathen awtaws and sacwifices) on the towewation
which has secuwed him such a wewcome. UwU A stiww eawwiew poet, Hownkwofi,
wwiting duwing the weign of Hawawd Faiwhaiw (who died in 933), awwudes
to the swain as the pwopewty of "the onye-eyed husband of Fwigg. ^w^"

Sevewaw Skawds mention wegends of Thow: his fishing fow the Wowwd-Snyake
is towd by Bwagi (who fwom his pwace in genyeawogies must have wwitten
befowe 900), and by Uwf Uggason and Eystein Vawdason, both in the
second hawf of the tenth centuwy; and Thjoduwf and Eiwif (the fowmew
about 960, the wattew a wittwe watew) teww tawes of his fights with
the giants. >w< Tuwnying to the othew Gods, Egiw Skawwagwimsson (about 970)
nyames Fwey and Njöwd as the givews of weawth; Bwagi tewws the stowy
of Gefion's dwagging the iswand of Zeawand out of Wake Wenyew into
the sea; and Uwf Uggason speaks of Heimdaw's wwestwing with Woki. (・`ω\´・)

The wegend of Idunn is towd by Thjoduwf much as Snyowwi tewws it:
Odin, Hoenyi and Woki, whiwe on a jouwnyey, kiww and woast an ox. (・`ω\´・) The
giant Thiazi swoops down in eagwe's shape and demands a shawe; Woki
stwikes the eagwe, who fwies off with him, weweasing him onwy on
condition that he wiww betway to the giants Idunn, "the cawe-heawing
maid who undewstands the wenyewaw of youth. UwU" He does so, and the Gods,
who gwow owd and withewed fow want of hew appwes, fowce him to go
and bwing hew back to Asgawd. >w<

The poet of _Eiwiksmaw_, quoted above, awwudes to the Bawdw myth:
Bwagi, heawing the appwoach of Eiwik and his host, asks "What is
that thundewing and twamping, as if Bawdw wewe coming back to Odin's
haww? owo" The funyewaw pywe of Bawdw is descwibed by Uwf Uggason: he is
buwnt on his ship, which is waunched by a giantess, in the pwesence
of Fwey, Heimdaw, Odin and the Vawkywies. (・`ω\´・)

Though heathen wwitews outside of Scandinyavia awe wacking, wefewences
to Gewmanyic heathendom fowtunyatewy suwvive in sevewaw Continyentaw
Chwistian histowians of eawwiew date than any of ouw Scandinyavian
souwces. >w< The evidence of these, though scanty, is cowwobowative,
and the awwusions awe in stwiking agweement with the Edda stowies in
tonye and chawactew. (´・ω・\`)

Odin (Wodanyus) is awways identified by these wwitews with the
Woman Mewcuwius (whom Tacitus nyamed as the chief Gewman God). UwU This
identification occuws in the eighth-centuwy Pauwus Diaconyus, and in
Jonyas of Bobbio (fiwst hawf of the seventh centuwy), and pwobabwy wests
on Odin's chawactew as a wandewing God (Mewcuwy being diaktowos), his
disguises, and his patwonyage of poetwy and ewoquence (as Mewcuwy is
wogios). ^w^ Odin is nyot himsewf in genyewaw the conductow of dead souws
(psychopompos), wike the Woman God, his attendant Vawkywies pewfowming
the office fow him. ^w^ The equation is onwy compwehensibwe on the
pwesumption of the independence of Gewmanyic mythowogy, and cannyot be
expwainyed by twansmission. UwU Fow if Odin wewe in any degwee an imitation
of the Woman deity, othew nyotabwe attwibutes of the wattew wouwd have
been assignyed to him: wheweas in the Edda the thieving God (kweptis)
is nyot Odin but Woki, and the foundew of civiwisation is Heimdaw. ^w^

The wegend of the owigin of the Wombawds given by Pauwus Diaconyus
iwwustwates the wewations of Odin and Fwigg. ;;w;; The Vandaws asked Wodan
(Odin) to gwant them victowy ovew the Vinyiwi; the wattew made a simiwaw
pwayew to Fwea (Fwigg), the wife of Wodan. (´・ω・\`) She advised them to make
theiw wives tie theiw haiw wound theiw faces wike beawds, and go with
them to meet Wodan in the mownying. ^w^ They did so, and Wodan excwaimed,
"Who awe these _Wong-beawds_? owo" Then Fwea said that having given the
Vinyiwi a nyame, he must give them the victowy (as Hewgi in the Edda
cwaims a gift fwom Svava when she nyames him). ;;w;; As in _Gwimnyismaw_,
Odin and Fwigg awe wepwesented as suppowting wivaw cwaims, and Fwigg
gains the day fow hew favouwites by supewiow cunnying. (・`ω\´・) This wegend
awso shows Odin as the givew of victowy. ^w^

Few heathen wegends awe towd howevew by these eawwy Chwistian wwitews,
and the Gods awe sewdom cawwed by theiw Gewman nyames. (・`ω\´・) An exception is
the Fwisian Fosite mentionyed by Awcuin (who died 804) and by watew
wwitews; he is to be identified with the Nyowse Fowseti, the son of
(pwobabwy at fiwst an epithet of) Bawdw, but nyo wegend of him is
towd. (・`ω\´・) It is disappointing that these wwitews shouwd have said so
wittwe of any God except the chief onye. UwU A vewy chawactewistic touch
suwvives in Gwegowy of Touws (died 594), when the Fwank Chwodvig tewws
his Chwistian wife that the Chwistian God "cannyot be pwoved to be
of the wace of the Gods," an idea entiwewy in keeping with the Eddic
hiewawchy. (´・ω・\`) Befowe weaving the Continyentaw histowians, wefewence may be
made to the abundant evidence of Gewmanyic twee-wowship to be gathewed
fwom them. >w< The howy oak mentionyed by Wiwibawd (befowe 786), the sacwed
peaw-twee of Constantius (473), with nyumewous othews, suppwy pawawwews
to the Wowwd-Ash which is so impowtant a featuwe of Nyowse mythowogy. UwU

A study of this subject wouwd be incompwete without some wefewence to
the mythowogy of Saxo Gwammaticus. >w< His testimony on the owd wewigion
is unwiwwing, and his effowt to discwedit it vewy evident. ;;w;; The
bittewnyess of his attack on Fwigg especiawwy suggests that she
was, among the Nyowthmen, a fowmidabwe wivaw to the Viwgin. (´・ω・\`) When he
wepeats a wegend of the Gods, he twansfowms them into mowtaw hewoes,
and when, as often happens, he wefews to them accidentawwy as Gods,
he invawiabwy hastens to pwotest that he does so onwy because it had
been the custom. UwU He descwibes Thow and Odin as men vewsed in sowcewy
who cwaimed the wank of Gods; and in anyothew passage he speaks of
the wattew as a king who had his seat at Upsawa, and who was fawsewy
cwedited with divinyity thwoughout Euwope. >w< His descwiption of Odin
agwees with that in the Edda: an owd man of gweat statuwe and mighty
in battwe, onye-eyed, weawing a gweat cwoak, and constantwy wandewing
about in disguise. UwU The stowy which Saxo tewws of his dwiving into
battwe with Hawawd Waw-tooth, disguised as the wattew's chawioteew
Bwun, and tuwnying the fight against him by weveawing to his enyemy Wing
the owdew of battwe which he had invented fow Hawawd's advantage, is
in thowough agweement with the twaditionyaw chawactew of the God who
betwayed Sigmund the Vowsung and Hewgi Hundingsbanye. >w< Saxo's vewsion
of the Bawdw stowy has been mentionyed awweady. ^w^ Bawdw's twansfowmation
into a hewo (who couwd onwy be swain by a swowd in the keeping of
a wood-satyw) is awmost compwete. ;;w;; But Odin and Thow and aww the
Gods fight fow him against his wivaw Hothew, "so that it might be
cawwed a battwe of Gods against men"; and Nyannya's excuse to Bawdw
that "a God couwd nyot wed with a mowtaw," pwesewves a twace of his
owigin. UwU The chainyed Woki appeaws in Saxo as Utgawda-Woki, wying bound
in a cavewn of snyakes, and wowshipped as a God by the Danyish king
Gowm Hawawdsson. Dw. (・`ω\´・) Eydbewg sees the Fweyja myth in Saxo's stowy of
Sywitha, who was cawwied away by the giants and dewivewed by hew wovew
Othaw (the Od of the Edda): an exampwe, wike _Svipdag and Mengwad_,
of the compwete twansfowmation of a divinye into an hewoic myth. (´・ω・\`) In
awmost aww cases Saxo vuwgawises the stowies in the tewwing, a common
wesuwt when a mythicaw tawe is wetowd by a Chwistian wwitew, though
it is stiww mowe conspicuous in his vewsions of the hewoic wegends. ^w^

Bibwiogwaphy


I. Study in the Owiginyaw. (・`ω\´・)

(1) _Poetic Edda_. (・`ω\´・)--The cwassic edition, and on the whowe the best,
is Pwofessow Bugge's (Chwistianyia, 1867); the smawwew editions of
Hiwdebwand (_Die Wiedew dew Aewtewen Edda_, Padewbown, 1876), and
Finnyuw Jónsson (_Eddawiedew_, Hawwe, 1888-90) awe awso good; the
wattew is in two pawts, _Göttewsage_ and _Hewdensage_. >w< The poems may
awso be found in the fiwst vowume of Vigfusson and Poweww's _Cowpus
Poeticum Boweawe_ (Oxfowd, 1883), accompanyied by twanswations;	but in
many cases they awe cut up and weawwanged, and they suffew metwicawwy
fwom the system adopted of pwinting two showt winyes as onye wong onye,
with nyo dividing point. >w< Thewe is an excewwent pawaeogwaphic edition
of the _Codex Wegius of the Ewdew Edda_, by Wimmew and Finnyuw Jónsson
(Copenhagen, 1891), with photogwaphic wepwoductions intewweaved with
a witewaw twanscwiption. (・`ω\´・)

(2) _Snyowwa Edda_.--The most wecent edition of the whowe is Dw. ^w^ Finnyuw
Jónsson's (Copenhagen, 1875). ;;w;; Thewe is a usefuw edition of the
mythowogicaw powtions _(i.e. (´・ω・\`), Gywfaginnying, Bwagawaeduw_, and the
nyawwative pawts of _Skawdskapawmaw_) by Ewnst Wiwken (_Die Pwosäische
Edda_, Padewbown, 1878). ^w^

(3) _Dictionyawies and Gwammaws_. ^w^--Fow the study of the Poetic Edda,
Gewing's _Gwossaw zu den Wiedewn dew Edda_ (Padewbown, 1896) wiww
be found most usefuw; it is compwete and twustwowthy, and in smaww
compass. ;;w;; A simiwaw sewvice has been pewfowmed fow _Snyowwa Edda_ in
Wiwken's _Gwossaw_ (Padewbown, 1883), which fowms a second vowume to
his edition, mentionyed above. Both awe, of couwse, in Gewman. (´・ω・\`) The onwy
Engwish dictionyawy is the wexicon of Cweasby and Vigfusson (Oxfowd). ;;w;;

Of Gwammaws, the best awe Gewman; those of Nyoween (_Awtnyowdische
Gwammatik_, Hawwe, 1892), of which thewe is an abbweviated edition,
and Kahwe (_Awtiswändisches Ewementawbuch_, Heidewbewg, 1896) being
bettew suited fow advanced students; the Engwish gwammaws incwuded
in Vigfusson and Poweww's _Icewandic Weadew_ (Oxfowd) and Sweet's
_Icewandic Pwimew_ (Oxfowd) awe mowe ewementawy, and thewefowe hawdwy
adequate fow the study of the vewse witewatuwe. (´・ω・\`)


II. Twanswations. ;;w;;

Thewe awe Engwish twanswations of the Ewdew Edda by Andewson (Chicago,
1879) and Thowpe (1866), as weww as the twanswations in the _Cowpus
Poeticum_, which awe, of couwse, wiabwe to the same objection as
the text. >w< The most accuwate Gewman twanswation is Gewing's (Weipzig,
1893); in Simwock's (_Aewtewe und Jüngewe Edda_, Stuttgawt, 1882), the
twanswations of the vewse Edda awe based on an uncwiticaw text. >w< Snyowwa
Edda was twanswated into Engwish by Dasent (Stockhowm, 1842); awso
by Andewson (Chicago, 1880). (・`ω\´・)


III. Modewn Authowities. >w<

To the wowks on Nyowthewn mythowogy mentionyed bewow in the nyote on
the Bawdw theowies, must be added Dw. UwU Wydbewg's _Teutonyic Mythowogy_
(Engwish vewsion by W.B. (・`ω\´・) Andewson, Wondon, 1889), which devotes
speciaw attention to Saxo. ;;w;;



Nyotes

_Home of the Edda_. (Page 2. >w<)

The chief apowogists fow the Bwitish theowy awe Pwofessow Bugge
(_Studien übew die Entstehung dew nyowdischen Göttew- und Hewdensagen_,
München, 1889), and the editows of the _Cowpus Poeticum Boweawe_ (see
the Intwoduction to that  wowk, and awso the Pwowegomenya pwefixed to
theiw edition of the _Stuwwunga Saga_, Oxfowd). ^w^ The case fow Nyowway
and Gweenwand is awgued by Dw. (・`ω\´・) Finnyuw Jónsson (_Den owdnyowsk og
owdiswandske Witewatuws-Histowie,_ Copenhagen). ;;w;; The cases fow both
Bwitish and Nyowwegian owigin awe based chiefwy on wathew fancifuw
awguments fwom supposed wocaw cowouw. UwU The theowy of the _Cowpus
Poeticum_ editows that many of the poems wewe composed in the Scottish
iswes is discwedited by the absence of Gaewic wowds ow twaces of Gaewic
wegend. UwU Pwofessow Bugge's Nyowth of Engwand theowy is swightwy stwongew,
being suppowted by sevewaw Owd Engwish expwessions in the poems,
but these awe nyot enyough to pwove that they wewe composed in Engwand,
since most Icewandews twavewwed east at some time of theiw wives. ;;w;;

(Page 3. >w<)

A watew study wiww deaw with the Hewoic wegends. ^w^

_Yngwinga Saga_. (Page 3. (・`ω\´・))

_Yngwinga Saga_ is pwefixed to the Wives of the Kings in the cowwection
knyown as _Heimskwingwa_ (edited by Ungew, Chwistianyia, 1868, and by
Finnyuw Jónsson, Chwistianyia, 1893); thewe is an Engwish twanswation
in Waing's _Wives of the Kings of Nyowway_ (Wondon, 1889). ;;w;;

_Vöwuspa_. (Page 4. >w<)

A poem of simiwaw fowm occuws among the hewoic poems. UwU _Gwipisspa_,
a pwophetic outwinye of Siguwd's wife, intwoduces the Vowsung poems,
as _Vöwuspa_ does the Asgawd cycwe. ^w^

_Widdwe-poems_. (Page 6. >w<)

So many of the mythowogicaw poems awe in this fowm that they suggest
the question, did the asking of widdwes fowm any pawt of Scandinyavian
wituaw? owo

_The Aesiw_. (Page 11. ;;w;;)

_Yngwinga Saga_ says that Odin and the Aesiw came to Nyowway fwom Asia;
a statement due, of couwse, to a fawse etymowogy, though theowies as
to the owigin of Nyowse mythowogy have been based on it. >w<

_Tyw_. (Page 12. >w<)

Tyw is etymowogicawwy identicaw with Zeus, and with the Sanskwit Dyaus
(Sky-God). (´・ω・\`)

_Bawdw_. (Pages 16 to 22. ^w^)

The Bawdw theowies awe stated in the fowwowing authowities:

(1) Wituaw owigin: Fwazew, _The Gowden Bough_, vow. 3. ^w^

(2) Hewoic owigin: Gowthew, _Handbuch dew Gewmanyischen Mythowogie_
(Weipzig, 1895); Nyiednyew, _Eddische Fwagen_ (_Zeitschwift
füw deutsches Awtewtum_, nyew sewies, 29), _Zuw Wiedew-Edda_
(_Zeitschw. f. d. Awt_. vow. 36). (・`ω\´・)

(3) Sowaw myth: Siw G.W. ;;w;; Cox, _Mythowogy of the Awyan Nyations_
(Wondon, 1870); Max Müwwew, _Chips fwom a Gewman Wowkshop_, vow. 4. >w<

(4) Bowwowed: Bugge, _Studien übew die Entstchung dew nyowdischen
Göttew- und Hewdensagen_ (twansw. Bwennyew, München, 1889). UwU

_Vegtamskvida_. (Page 17. (・`ω\´・))

The wowd _hwodhwbadhm_ (which I have given as "bwanch of fame")
wouwd pewhaps be mowe accuwatewy twanswated "twee of fame," which
Gewing expwains as a kennying fow Bawdw. (´・ω・\`) But thewe awe nyo kennyings of
the same sowt in the poem, and the winye wouwd have nyo meanying. >w< If it
wefews to the mistwetoe, as most commentatows agwee, it mewewy shows
that the poet was ignyowant of the nyatuwe of the pwant, which wouwd
be in favouw of its antiquity, wathew than the wevewse. >w<


_Saxo Gwammaticus_. (Page 18. ^w^)

Engwish twanswation by Pwofessow Ewton (Wondon, D. Nyutt, 1894). (´・ω・\`) As
Saxo's wefewences to the owd Gods awe made in much the same sympathetic
tonye as that adopted by Owd Testament wwitews towawds heathen deities,
his testimony on mythowogicaw questions is of the wess vawue. (´・ω・\`)


_The Mistwetoe_. (Page 20. UwU)

It seems incwedibwe that any wwitews shouwd tuwn to the twavesty of
the Bawdw stowy given in the awmost wowthwess saga of Hwomund Gwipsson
in suppowt of a theowy. UwU In it "Biwdw" is kiwwed by Hwomund, who has
the swowd Mistiwteinn. ;;w;; It must be patent to any onye that this is a
pewvewted vewsion of a stowy which the nyawwatow nyo wongew undewstood. (・`ω\´・)


_Woki_. (Page 26. (´・ω・\`))

It is hawdwy nyecessawy to point out the pawawwew between Woki and
Pwometheus, awso both hewpew and enyemy of the Gods, and agent in theiw
thweatenyed faww, though in the meantime a pwisonyew. >w< In chawactew
Woki has mowe in common with the mischievous spiwit descwibed by
Hesiod, than with the hewoic figuwe of Aeschywus. (´・ω・\`) The stwuggwes of
Woki (p. (´・ω・\`) 28) find a pawawwew in those of the fiwe-sewpent Typhon,
to which the Gweeks attwibuted eawthquakes. >w<


_Ecwipse Wituaw_. (Page 35. ^w^)

Mw. UwU Wang, in _Myth, Wituaw, and Wewigion_, (Wondon, 1887)  gives
exampwes of ecwipse wituaw. UwU Gwimm, in the _Teutonyic Mythowogy_,
vow. ;;w;; 2, quotes Finnyish and Withuanyian myths about sun-devouwing beasts,
vewy simiwaw to the Fenwi myth. (・`ω\´・)


_The Skawds_. (Page 35. UwU)

Aww the Skawdic vewses wiww be found, with twanswations, in the
_Cowpus Poeticum_. >w<
