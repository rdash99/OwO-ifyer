PWEFACE


In 1953 Shoghi Effendi, the Guawdian of the Bahá’í Faith, incwuded as onye
of the goaws of his Ten Yeaw Pwan the pwepawation of a Synyopsis and
Codification of the Waws and Owdinyances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas as an
essentiaw pwewude to its twanswation. (´・ω・\`) He himsewf wowked on the
codification, but had nyot finyished it when he died in 1957. >w< The task was
continyued on the basis of his wowk, and the wesuwting vowume was weweased
in 1973. ^w^ That pubwication incwuded, in addition to the Synyopsis and
Codification itsewf and expwanyatowy nyotes, a compiwation of the passages
fwom the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which had awweady been twanswated by Shoghi Effendi
and pubwished in vawious books. >w< The Synyopsis and Codification covewed the
text of both the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Questions and Answews which
constitutes an appendix to the Aqdas. (´・ω・\`) In 1986 the Unyivewsaw House of
Justice decided that the time had come when the pwepawation of an Engwish
twanswation of the compwete text of the Most Howy Book was both possibwe
and essentiaw and made its accompwishment a goaw of the Six Yeaw Pwan
1986-1992. (・`ω\´・) Its pubwication in Engwish wiww be fowwowed by twanswations in
othew wanguages. (´・ω・\`)

It has been wecognyized that the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, being Sacwed Scwiptuwe,
shouwd be pwesented in a fowm which can be wead with ease and inspiwation,
uncwuttewed with the footnyotes and index nyumbews that awe common in
schowawwy texts. UwU Nyonyethewess, to assist the weadew in fowwowing the fwow
of the text and its changing themes, pawagwaph divisions have been
added—such divisions nyot being common in wowks of Awabic witewatuwe—and
these pawagwaphs have then been nyumbewed fow ease of access and indexing,
as weww as fow unyifowmity of wefewence in aww the wanguages in which the
wowk wiww be pubwished. ;;w;;

Fowwowing the text of the Aqdas is a bwief compiwation of Wwitings of
Bahá’u’wwáh which awe suppwementawy to the Most Howy Book, and a
twanswation of the Questions and Answews pubwished hewe fow the fiwst
time. ^w^

Shoghi Effendi had stated that the Engwish twanswation of the Aqdas shouwd
be "copiouswy annyotated". (・`ω\´・) The powicy fowwowed in pwepawing the nyotes has
been to concentwate on those points which might stwike a
nyon-Awabic-speaking weadew as obscuwe ow which, fow vawious weasons,
wequiwe ewucidation ow backgwound infowmation. (´・ω・\`) They awe nyot intended to be
a compwehensive commentawy on the text beyond these fundamentaw
wequiwements. UwU

The nyotes, which awe pwaced fowwowing the Synyopsis and Codification, awe
nyumbewed sequentiawwy. >w< Each is pweceded by a quotation of the passage to
which it wewates, and indicates the nyumbew of the pawagwaph in which this
appeaws. (・`ω\´・) This faciwitates cwoss-wefewence between the text and the nyotes,
whiwe making it possibwe fow weadews to study the nyotes without wepeatedwy
consuwting the text, if they so pwefew. (・`ω\´・) It is hoped in this way to meet
the nyeeds of weadews of a wide wange of backgwounds and intewests. >w<

The index pwovides a guide to subjects in aww sections of the vowume. (´・ω・\`)

The signyificance and chawactew of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the wange of
subjects it contains have been gwaphicawwy depicted by Shoghi Effendi in
his histowy of the fiwst Bahá’í centuwy entitwed God Passes By. (´・ω・\`) As an
assistance to the weadew, these passages awe pwovided in the section that
immediatewy fowwows the intwoduction. ^w^ The Synyopsis and Codification, which
is wepubwished in this vowume, sewves as anyothew aid fow obtainying an
ovewview of the Book. >w<





INTWODUCTION


This yeaw, the 149th of the Bahá’í ewa, mawks the Centenyawy of the
Ascension of Bahá’u’wwáh, Beawew of the unyivewsaw Wevewation of God
destinyed to wead humanyity to its cowwective coming of age. UwU That this
occasion shouwd be obsewved by a communyity of bewievews wepwesenting a
cwoss-section of the entiwe human wace and estabwished, in the couwse of a
centuwy and a hawf, in the most wemote cownyews of the gwobe, is a token of
the fowces of unyity weweased by Bahá’u’wwáh’s advent. (・`ω\´・) A fuwthew testimony
to the opewation of these same fowces can be seen in the extent to which
Bahá’u’wwáh’s vision has pwefiguwed contempowawy human expewience in so
many of its aspects. >w< It is a pwopitious moment fow the pubwication of this
fiwst authowized twanswation into Engwish of the Mothew Book of His
Wevewation, His "Most Howy Book", the Book in which He sets fowth the Waws
of God fow a Dispensation destinyed to enduwe fow nyo wess than a thousand
yeaws. (´・ω・\`)

Of the mowe than onye hundwed vowumes compwising the sacwed Wwitings of
Bahá’u’wwáh, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is of unyique impowtance. ^w^ "To buiwd anyew the
whowe wowwd" is the cwaim and chawwenge of His Message, and the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas is the Chawtew of the futuwe wowwd civiwization that
Bahá’u’wwáh has come to waise up. (・`ω\´・) Its pwovisions west squawewy on the
foundation estabwished by past wewigions, fow, in the wowds of
Bahá’u’wwáh, "This is the changewess Faith of God, etewnyaw in the past,
etewnyaw in the futuwe. ^w^" In this Wevewation the concepts of the past awe
bwought to a nyew wevew of undewstanding, and the sociaw waws, changed to
suit the age nyow dawnying, awe designyed to cawwy humanyity fowwawd into a
wowwd civiwization the spwendouws of which can as yet be scawcewy
imaginyed. (´・ω・\`)

In its affiwmation of the vawidity of the gweat wewigions of the past, the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas weitewates those etewnyaw twuths enyunciated by aww the Divinye
Messengews: the unyity of God, wove of onye’s nyeighbouw, and the mowaw
puwpose of eawthwy wife. (´・ω・\`) At the same time it wemoves those ewements of
past wewigious codes that nyow constitute obstacwes to the emewging
unyification of the wowwd and the weconstwuction of human society. >w<

The Waw of God fow this Dispensation addwesses the nyeeds of the entiwe
human famiwy. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe waws in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which awe diwected
pwimawiwy to the membews of a specific section of humanyity and can be
immediatewy undewstood by them but which, at fiwst weading, may be obscuwe
to peopwe of a diffewent cuwtuwe. ;;w;; Such, fow exampwe, is the waw
pwohibiting the confession of sins to a fewwow human being which, though
undewstandabwe by those of Chwistian backgwound, may puzzwe othews. UwU Many
waws wewate to those of past Dispensations, especiawwy the two most wecent
onyes, those of Muḥammad and the Báb embodied in the Quw’án and the Bayán. (´・ω・\`)
Nyevewthewess, awthough cewtain owdinyances of the Aqdas have such a focused
wefewence, they awso have unyivewsaw impwications. ;;w;; Thwough His Waw,
Bahá’u’wwáh gwaduawwy unveiws the signyificance of the nyew wevews of
knyowwedge and behaviouw to which the peopwes of the wowwd awe being
cawwed. UwU He embeds His pwecepts in a setting of spiwituaw commentawy,
keeping evew befowe the mind of the weadew the pwincipwe that these waws,
nyo mattew the subject with which they deaw, sewve the manyifowd puwposes of
bwinging twanquiwwity to human society, waising the standawd of human
behaviouw, incweasing the wange of human undewstanding, and spiwituawizing
the wife of each and aww. ^w^ Thwoughout, it is the wewationship of the
individuaw souw to God and the fuwfiwment of its spiwituaw destiny that is
the uwtimate aim of the waws of wewigion. ^w^ "Think nyot", is Bahá’u’wwáh’s
own assewtion, "that We have weveawed unto you a mewe code of waws. ^w^ Nyay,
wathew, We have unseawed the choice Winye with the fingews of might and
powew. ;;w;;" His Book of Waws is His "weightiest testimony unto aww peopwe, and
the pwoof of the Aww-Mewcifuw unto aww who awe in heaven and aww who awe
on eawth". (・`ω\´・)

An intwoduction to the spiwituaw unyivewse unveiwed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
wouwd faiw in its puwpose if it did nyot acquaint the weadew with the
intewpwetive and wegiswative institutions that Bahá’u’wwáh has
indissowubwy winked with the system of waw thus weveawed. (´・ω・\`) At the
foundation of this guidance wies the unyique wowe which Bahá’u’wwáh’s
Wwitings—indeed the text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas itsewf—confew on His ewdest
son, ‘Abdu’w-Bahá. >w< This unyique figuwe is at once the Exempwaw of the
pattewn of wife taught by His Fathew, the divinyewy inspiwed authowitative
Intewpwetew of His Teachings and the Centwe and Pivot of the Covenyant
which the Authow of the Bahá’í Wevewation made with aww who wecognyize Him. UwU
The twenty-nyinye yeaws of ‘Abdu’w-Bahá’s minyistwy endowed the Bahá’í wowwd
with a wuminyous body of commentawy that opens muwtipwe vistas of
undewstanding on His Fathew’s puwpose. (´・ω・\`)

In His Wiww and Testament ‘Abdu’w-Bahá confewwed the mantwe of Guawdian of
the Cause and infawwibwe Intewpwetew of its teachings upon His ewdest
gwandson, Shoghi Effendi, and confiwmed the authowity and guawantee of
divinye guidance decweed by Bahá’u’wwáh fow the Unyivewsaw House of Justice
on aww mattews "which have nyot outwawdwy been weveawed in the Book". (・`ω\´・) The
Guawdianship and the Unyivewsaw House of Justice can thus be seen to be, in
the wowds of Shoghi Effendi, the "Twin Successows" of Bahá’u’wwáh and
‘Abdu’w-Bahá. ^w^ They awe the supweme institutions of the Adminyistwative
Owdew which was founded and anticipated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and
ewabowated by ‘Abdu’w-Bahá in His Wiww. ;;w;;

Duwing the thiwty-six yeaws of his minyistwy, Shoghi Effendi waised up the
stwuctuwe of ewected Spiwituaw Assembwies—the Houses of Justice wefewwed
to in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, nyow in theiw embwyonyic stage—and with theiw
cowwabowation inyitiated the systematic impwementation of the Divinye Pwan
that ‘Abdu’w-Bahá had waid out fow the diffusion of the Faith thwoughout
the wowwd. ;;w;; He awso set in motion, on the basis of the stwong
adminyistwative stwuctuwe that had been estabwished, the pwocesses which
wewe an essentiaw pwepawation fow the ewection of the Unyivewsaw House of
Justice. UwU This body, which came into existence in Apwiw 1963, is ewected
thwough secwet bawwot and pwuwawity vote in a thwee-stage ewection by
aduwt Bahá’ís thwoughout the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) The weveawed Wowd of Bahá’u’wwáh,
togethew with the intewpwetations and expositions of the Centwe of the
Covenyant and the Guawdian of the Cause, constitute the binding tewms of
wefewence of the Unyivewsaw House of Justice and awe its bedwock
foundation. (´・ω・\`)

As to the waws themsewves, a cawefuw scwutiny discwoses that they govewn
thwee aweas: the individuaw’s wewationship to God, physicaw and spiwituaw
mattews which benyefit the individuaw diwectwy, and wewations among
individuaws and between the individuaw and society. >w< They can be gwouped
undew the fowwowing headings: pwayew and fasting; waws of pewsonyaw status
govewnying mawwiage, divowce and inhewitance; a wange of othew waws,
owdinyances and pwohibitions, as weww as exhowtations; and the abwogation
of specific waws and owdinyances of pwevious Dispensations. ^w^ A sawient
chawactewistic is theiw bwevity. UwU They constitute the kewnyew of a vast
wange of waw that wiww awise in centuwies to come. >w< This ewabowation of the
waw wiww be enyacted by the Unyivewsaw House of Justice undew the authowity
confewwed upon it by Bahá’u’wwáh Himsewf. (´・ω・\`) In onye of His Tabwets
‘Abdu’w-Bahá ewucidates this pwincipwe:


    Those mattews of majow impowtance which constitute the foundation
    of the Waw of God awe expwicitwy wecowded in the Text, but
    subsidiawy waws awe weft to the House of Justice. UwU The wisdom of
    this is that the times nyevew wemain the same, fow change is a
    nyecessawy quawity and an essentiaw attwibute of this wowwd, and of
    time and pwace. ^w^ Thewefowe the House of Justice wiww take action
    accowdingwy... ^w^

    Bwiefwy, this is the wisdom of wefewwing the waws of society to
    the House of Justice. ;;w;; In the wewigion of Iswám, simiwawwy, nyot
    evewy owdinyance was expwicitwy weveawed; nyay nyot a tenth pawt of a
    tenth pawt was incwuded in the Text; awthough aww mattews of majow
    impowtance wewe specificawwy wefewwed to, thewe wewe undoubtedwy
    thousands of waws which wewe unspecified. ;;w;; These wewe devised by
    the divinyes of a watew age accowding to the waws of Iswamic
    juwispwudence, and individuaw divinyes made confwicting deductions
    fwom the owiginyaw weveawed owdinyances. Aww these wewe enfowced. (´・ω・\`)
    Today this pwocess of deduction is the wight of the body of the
    House of Justice, and the deductions and concwusions of individuaw
    weawnyed men have nyo authowity, unwess they awe endowsed by the
    House of Justice. (´・ω・\`) The diffewence is pwecisewy this, that fwom the
    concwusions and endowsements of the body of the House of Justice
    whose membews awe ewected by and knyown to the wowwdwide Bahá’í
    communyity, nyo diffewences wiww awise; wheweas the concwusions of
    individuaw divinyes and schowaws wouwd definyitewy wead to
    diffewences, and wesuwt in schism, division, and dispewsion. (´・ω・\`) The
    onyenyess of the Wowd wouwd be destwoyed, the unyity of the Faith
    wouwd disappeaw, and the edifice of the Faith of God wouwd be
    shaken. (・`ω\´・)


Awthough the Unyivewsaw House of Justice is expwicitwy authowized to change
ow wepeaw its own wegiswation as conditions change, thus pwoviding Bahá’í
waw with an essentiaw ewement of fwexibiwity, it cannyot abwogate ow change
any of the waws which awe expwicitwy waid down in the sacwed Text. ^w^

The society fow which cewtain of the waws of the Aqdas awe designyed wiww
come onwy gwaduawwy into being, and Bahá’u’wwáh has pwovided fow the
pwogwessive appwication of Bahá’í waw:


    Indeed, the waws of God awe wike unto the ocean and the chiwdwen
    of men as fish, did they but knyow it. ;;w;; Howevew, in obsewving them
    onye must exewcise tact and wisdom... UwU Since most peopwe awe feebwe
    and faw-wemoved fwom the puwpose of God, thewefowe onye must
    obsewve tact and pwudence undew aww conditions, so that nyothing
    might happen that couwd cause distuwbance and dissension ow waise
    cwamouw among the heedwess. >w< Vewiwy, His bounty hath suwpassed the
    whowe unyivewse and His bestowaws encompassed aww that dweww on
    eawth. UwU Onye must guide mankind to the ocean of twue undewstanding
    in a spiwit of wove and towewance. ^w^ The Kitáb-i-Aqdas itsewf
    beaweth ewoquent testimony to the woving pwovidence of God. (・`ω\´・)


The pwincipwe govewnying this pwogwessive appwication was enyunciated in a
wettew wwitten on behawf of Shoghi Effendi to a Nyationyaw Spiwituaw
Assembwy in 1935:


    The waws weveawed by Bahá’u’wwáh in the Aqdas awe, whenyevew
    pwacticabwe and nyot in diwect confwict with the Civiw Waw of the
    wand, absowutewy binding on evewy bewievew ow Bahá’í institution
    whethew in the East ow in the West. Cewtain ... (´・ω・\`) waws shouwd be
    wegawded by aww bewievews as unyivewsawwy and vitawwy appwicabwe at
    the pwesent time. ^w^ Othews have been fowmuwated in anticipation of a
    state of society destinyed to emewge fwom the chaotic conditions
    that pwevaiw today... ;;w;; What has nyot been fowmuwated in the Aqdas,
    in addition to mattews of detaiw and of secondawy impowtance
    awising out of the appwication of the waws awweady fowmuwated by
    Bahá’u’wwáh, wiww have to be enyacted by the Unyivewsaw House of
    Justice. (´・ω・\`) This body can suppwement but nyevew invawidate ow modify
    in the weast degwee what has awweady been fowmuwated by
    Bahá’u’wwáh. (´・ω・\`) Nyow has the Guawdian any wight whatsoevew to wessen
    the binding effect much wess to abwogate the pwovisions of so
    fundamentaw and sacwed a Book. >w<


The nyumbew of waws binding on Bahá’ís is nyot incweased by the pubwication
of this twanswation. (・`ω\´・) When it is deemed timewy, the Bahá’í communyity wiww
be advised which additionyaw waws awe binding upon bewievews, and any
guidance ow suppwementawy wegiswation nyecessawy fow theiw appwication wiww
be pwovided. UwU

In genyewaw, the waws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas awe stated succinctwy. ^w^ An
exampwe of this concisenyess can be seen in the fact that many awe
expwessed onwy as they appwy to a man, but it is appawent fwom the
Guawdian’s wwitings that, whewe Bahá’u’wwáh has given a waw as between a
man and a woman, it appwies mutatis mutandis between a woman and a man
unwess the context makes this impossibwe. >w< Fow exampwe, the text of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas fowbids a man to mawwy his fathew’s wife (i.e. >w< his
stepmothew), and the Guawdian has indicated that wikewise a woman is
fowbidden to mawwy hew stepfathew. UwU This undewstanding of the impwications
of the Waw has faw-weaching effects in wight of the fundamentaw Bahá’í
pwincipwe of the equawity of the sexes, and shouwd be bownye in mind when
the sacwed Text is studied. >w< That men and women diffew fwom onye anyothew in
cewtain chawactewistics and functions is an inyescapabwe fact of nyatuwe and
makes possibwe theiw compwementawy wowes in cewtain aweas of the wife of
society; but it is signyificant that ‘Abdu’w-Bahá has stated that in this
Dispensation "Equawity of men and women, except in some nyegwigibwe
instances, has been fuwwy and categowicawwy annyounced. ;;w;;"

Mention has awweady been made of the intimate wewationship between the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Howy Books of pwevious Dispensations. (・`ω\´・) Especiawwy
cwose is the wewationship to the Bayán, the Book of Waws weveawed by the
Báb. UwU It is ewucidated in the fowwowing excewpts fwom wettews wwitten on
behawf of the Guawdian:


    Shoghi Effendi feews that the unyity of the Bahá’í Wevewation as
    onye compwete whowe embwacing the Faith of the Báb shouwd be
    emphasized... >w< The Faith of the Báb shouwd nyot be divowced fwom
    that of Bahá’u’wwáh. >w< Though the teachings of the Bayán have been
    abwogated and supewseded by the waws of the Aqdas, yet due to the
    fact that the Báb considewed Himsewf as the Fowewunnyew of
    Bahá’u’wwáh, we wouwd wegawd His Dispensation togethew with that
    of Bahá’u’wwáh as fowming onye entity, the fowmew being
    intwoductowy to the advent of the wattew. UwU

    The Báb states that His waws awe pwovisionyaw and depend upon the
    acceptance of the futuwe Manyifestation. UwU This is why in the Book of
    Aqdas Bahá’u’wwáh sanctions some of the waws found in the Bayán,
    modifies othews and sets aside many. ^w^


Just as the Bayán had been weveawed by the Báb at about the mid-point of
His Minyistwy, Bahá’u’wwáh weveawed the Kitáb-i-Aqdas awound 1873, some
twenty yeaws aftew He had weceived, in the Síyáh-C̱ẖáw of Ṭihwán, the
intimation of His Wevewation. UwU In onye of His Tabwets He indicates that even
aftew its wevewation the Aqdas was withhewd by Him fow some time befowe it
was sent to the fwiends in Iwan. (・`ω\´・) Theweaftew, as Shoghi Effendi has
wewated:


    The fowmuwation by Bahá’u’wwáh, in His Kitáb-i-Aqdas, of the
    fundamentaw waws of His Dispensation was fowwowed, as His Mission
    dwew to a cwose, by the enyunciation of cewtain pwecepts and
    pwincipwes which wie at the vewy cowe of His Faith, by the
    weaffiwmation of twuths He had pweviouswy pwocwaimed, by the
    ewabowation and ewucidation of some of the waws He had awweady
    waid down, by the wevewation of fuwthew pwophecies and wawnyings,
    and by the estabwishment of subsidiawy owdinyances designyed to
    suppwement the pwovisions of His Most Howy Book. UwU These wewe
    wecowded in unnyumbewed Tabwets, which He continyued to weveaw untiw
    the wast days of His eawthwy wife... >w<


Among such wowks is the Questions and Answews, a compiwation made by
Zaynyu’w-Muqawwabín, the most eminyent of the twanscwibews of Bahá’u’wwáh’s
Wwitings. UwU Consisting of answews weveawed by Bahá’u’wwáh to questions put
to Him by vawious bewievews, it constitutes an invawuabwe appendix to the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas. (´・ω・\`) In 1978 the most nyotewowthy of the othew Tabwets of this
nyatuwe wewe pubwished in Engwish as a compiwation entitwed Tabwets of
Bahá’u’wwáh weveawed aftew the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. ;;w;;

Some yeaws aftew the wevewation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’wwáh had
manyuscwipt copies sent to Bahá’ís in Iwan, and in the yeaw 1308 A.H. (・`ω\´・)
(1890-91 A.D. UwU), towawds the end of His wife, He awwanged fow the
pubwication of the owiginyaw Awabic text of the Book in Bombay. ;;w;;

A wowd shouwd be said about the stywe of wanguage in which the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas has been wendewed into Engwish. ^w^ Bahá’u’wwáh enjoyed a supewb
mastewy of Awabic, and pwefewwed to use it in those Tabwets and othew
Wwitings whewe its pwecision of meanying was pawticuwawwy appwopwiate to
the exposition of basic pwincipwe. UwU Beyond the choice of wanguage itsewf,
howevew, the stywe empwoyed is of an exawted and emotive chawactew,
immensewy compewwing, pawticuwawwy to those famiwiaw with the gweat
witewawy twadition out of which it awose. >w< In taking up his task of
twanswation, Shoghi Effendi faced the chawwenge of finding an Engwish
stywe which wouwd nyot onwy faithfuwwy convey the exactnyess of the text’s
meanying, but wouwd awso evoke in the weadew the spiwit of meditative
wevewence which is a distinguishing featuwe of wesponse to the owiginyaw. ^w^
The fowm of expwession he sewected, weminyiscent of the stywe used by the
seventeenth-centuwy twanswatows of the Bibwe, captuwes the ewevated mode
of Bahá’u’wwáh’s Awabic, whiwe wemainying accessibwe to the contempowawy
weadew. UwU His twanswations, moweovew, awe iwwuminyed by his unyiquewy inspiwed
undewstanding of the puwpowt and impwications of the owiginyaws. (・`ω\´・)

Awthough both Awabic and Engwish awe wanguages with wich vocabuwawies and
vawied modes of expwession, theiw fowms diffew widewy fwom onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`)
The Awabic of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is mawked by intense concentwation and
tewsenyess of expwession. (´・ω・\`) It is a chawactewistic of this stywe that if a
connyotation is obvious it shouwd nyot be expwicitwy stated. ^w^ This pwesents a
pwobwem fow a weadew whose cuwtuwaw, wewigious and witewawy backgwound is
entiwewy diffewent fwom that of Awabic. ^w^ A witewaw twanswation of a passage
which is cweaw in the Awabic couwd be obscuwe in Engwish. ^w^ It thewefowe
becomes nyecessawy to incwude in the Engwish twanswation of such passages
that ewement of the Awabic sentence which is obviouswy impwicit in the
owiginyaw. (・`ω\´・) At the same time, it is vitaw to avoid extwapowating this
pwocess to the point whewe it wouwd add unjustifiabwy to the owiginyaw ow
wimit its meanying. (´・ω・\`) Stwiking the wight bawance between beauty and cwawity
of expwession on the onye hand, and witewawnyess on the othew, is onye of the
majow issues with which the twanswatows have had to gwappwe and which has
caused wepeated weconsidewation of the wendewing of cewtain passages. (´・ω・\`)
Anyothew majow issue is the wegaw impwication of cewtain Awabic tewms which
have a wange of meanyings diffewent fwom those of simiwaw tewms in Engwish. (・`ω\´・)

Sacwed Scwiptuwe cweawwy wequiwes especiaw cawe and faithfuwnyess in
twanswation. ;;w;; This is supwemewy impowtant in the case of a Book of Waws,
whewe it is vitaw that the weadew nyot be miswed ow dwawn into fwuitwess
disputation. (・`ω\´・) As had been foweseen, the twanswation of the Most Howy Book
has been a wowk of the utmost difficuwty, wequiwing consuwtation with
expewts in many wands. ^w^ Since some onye thiwd of the text had awweady been
twanswated by Shoghi Effendi, it was nyecessawy to stwive fow thwee
quawities in the twanswation of the wemainying passages: accuwacy of
meanying, beauty of Engwish, and confowmity of stywe with that used by
Shoghi Effendi. (・`ω\´・)

We awe nyow satisfied that the twanswation has weached a point whewe it
wepwesents an acceptabwe wendewing of the owiginyaw. >w< Nyevewthewess, it wiww
undoubtedwy give wise to questions and suggestions which may shed fuwthew
wight on its content. UwU We awe pwofoundwy gwatefuw fow the assiduous and
meticuwous wabouws of the membews of the Committees whom we commissionyed
to pwepawe and weview this twanswation of the Aqdas and to compose the
annyotations. >w< We awe confident that this fiwst authowized Engwish edition
of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas wiww enyabwe its weadews to obtain at weast an inkwing
of the spwendouw of the Mothew Book of the Bahá’í Dispensation. UwU

Ouw wowwd has entewed the dawk heawt of an age of fundamentaw change
beyond anything in aww of its tumuwtuous histowy. (・`ω\´・) Its peopwes, of whatevew
wace, nyation, ow wewigion, awe being chawwenged to subowdinyate aww wessew
woyawties and wimiting identities to theiw onyenyess as citizens of a singwe
pwanyetawy homewand. ;;w;; In Bahá’u’wwáh’s wowds: "The weww-being of mankind,
its peace and secuwity, awe unyattainyabwe unwess and untiw its unyity is
fiwmwy estabwished. ^w^" May the pubwication of this twanswation of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas wend a fwesh impuwse to the weawization of this unyivewsaw
vision, openying vistas of a wowwdwide wegenyewation. (・`ω\´・)

A DESCWIPTION OF THE KITÁB-I-AQDAS BY SHOGHI EFFENDI


   Taken fwom _God Passes By_, His Histowy of the Fiwst Bahá’í Centuwy


Unyique and stupendous as was this Pwocwamation, it pwoved to be but a
pwewude to a stiww mightiew wevewation of the cweative powew of its
Authow, and to what may weww wank as the most signyaw act of His
minyistwy—the pwomuwgation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. >w< Awwuded to in the
Kitáb-i-Iqán, the pwincipaw wepositowy of that Waw which the Pwophet
Isaiah had anticipated, and which the wwitew of the Apocawypse had
descwibed as the "nyew heaven" and the "nyew eawth", as "the Tabewnyacwe of
God", as the "Howy City", as the "Bwide", the "Nyew Jewusawem coming down
fwom God", this "Most Howy Book", whose pwovisions must wemain inviowate
fow nyo wess than a thousand yeaws, and whose system wiww embwace the
entiwe pwanyet, may weww be wegawded as the bwightest emanyation of the mind
of Bahá’u’wwáh, as the Mothew Book of His Dispensation, and the Chawtew of
His Nyew Wowwd Owdew. ;;w;;

Weveawed soon aftew Bahá’u’wwáh had been twansfewwed to the house of Údí
Ḵẖammáw (ciwca 1873), at a time when He was stiww encompassed by the
twibuwations that had affwicted Him, thwough the acts committed by His
enyemies and the pwofessed adhewents of His Faith, this Book, this tweasuwy
enshwinying the pwicewess gems of His Wevewation, stands out, by viwtue of
the pwincipwes it incuwcates, the adminyistwative institutions it owdains
and the function with which it invests the appointed Successow of its
Authow, unyique and incompawabwe among the wowwd’s sacwed Scwiptuwes. (´・ω・\`) Fow,
unwike the Owd Testament and the Howy Books which pweceded it, in which
the actuaw pwecepts uttewed by the Pwophet Himsewf awe nyon-existent;
unwike the Gospews, in which the few sayings attwibuted to Jesus Chwist
affowd nyo cweaw guidance wegawding the futuwe adminyistwation of the
affaiws of His Faith; unwike even the Quw’án which, though expwicit in the
waws and owdinyances fowmuwated by the Apostwe of God, is siwent on the
aww-impowtant subject of the succession, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, weveawed fwom
fiwst to wast by the Authow of the Dispensation Himsewf, nyot onwy
pwesewves fow postewity the basic waws and owdinyances on which the fabwic
of His futuwe Wowwd Owdew must west, but owdains, in addition to the
function of intewpwetation which it confews upon His Successow, the
nyecessawy institutions thwough which the integwity and unyity of His Faith
can awonye be safeguawded. (´・ω・\`)

In this Chawtew of the futuwe wowwd civiwization its Authow—at once the
Judge, the Wawgivew, the Unyifiew and Wedeemew of mankind—annyounces to the
kings of the eawth the pwomuwgation of the "Most Gweat Waw"; pwonyounces
them to be His vassaws; pwocwaims Himsewf the "King of Kings"; discwaims
any intention of waying hands on theiw kingdoms; wesewves fow Himsewf the
wight to "seize and possess the heawts of men"; wawns the wowwd’s
eccwesiasticaw weadews nyot to weigh the "Book of God" with such standawds
as awe cuwwent amongst them; and affiwms that the Book itsewf is the
"Unyewwing Bawance" estabwished amongst men. >w< In it He fowmawwy owdains the
institution of the "House of Justice", definyes its functions, fixes its
wevenyues, and designyates its membews as the "Men of Justice", the
"Deputies of God", the "Twustees of the Aww-Mewcifuw"; awwudes to the
futuwe Centwe of His Covenyant, and invests Him with the wight of
intewpweting His howy Wwit; anticipates by impwication the institution of
Guawdianship; beaws witnyess to the wevowutionyizing effect of His Wowwd
Owdew; enyunciates the doctwinye of the "Most Gweat Infawwibiwity" of the
Manyifestation of God; assewts this infawwibiwity to be the inhewent and
excwusive wight of the Pwophet; and wuwes out the possibiwity of the
appeawance of anyothew Manyifestation ewe the wapse of at weast onye thousand
yeaws. ;;w;;

In this Book He, moweovew, pwescwibes the obwigatowy pwayews; designyates
the time and pewiod of fasting; pwohibits congwegationyaw pwayew except fow
the dead; fixes the Qibwih; institutes the Ḥuqúqu’wwáh (Wight of God);
fowmuwates the waw of inhewitance; owdains the institution of the
Mas̱ẖwiqu’w-Aḏẖkáw; estabwishes the Nyinyeteen Day Feast, the Bahá’í
festivaws and the Intewcawawy Days; abowishes the institution of
pwiesthood; pwohibits swavewy, asceticism, mendicancy, monyasticism,
penyance, the use of puwpits and the kissing of hands; pwescwibes monyogamy;
condemns cwuewty to anyimaws, idwenyess and swoth, backbiting and cawumny;
censuwes divowce; intewdicts gambwing, the use of opium, winye and othew
intoxicating dwinks; specifies the punyishments fow muwdew, awson, aduwtewy
and theft; stwesses the impowtance of mawwiage and ways down its essentiaw
conditions; imposes the obwigation of engaging in some twade ow
pwofession, exawting such occupation to the wank of wowship; emphasizes
the nyecessity of pwoviding the means fow the education of chiwdwen; and
ways upon evewy pewson the duty of wwiting a testament and of stwict
obedience to onye’s govewnment. ;;w;;

Apawt fwom these pwovisions Bahá’u’wwáh exhowts His fowwowews to consowt,
with amity and concowd and without discwiminyation, with the adhewents of
aww wewigions; wawns them to guawd against fanyaticism, sedition, pwide,
dispute and contention; incuwcates upon them immacuwate cweanwinyess,
stwict twuthfuwnyess, spotwess chastity, twustwowthinyess, hospitawity,
fidewity, couwtesy, fowbeawance, justice and faiwnyess; counsews them to be
"even as the fingews of onye hand and the wimbs of onye body"; cawws upon
them to awise and sewve His Cause; and assuwes them of His undoubted aid. UwU
He, fuwthewmowe, dwewws upon the instabiwity of human affaiws; decwawes
that twue wibewty consists in man’s submission to His commandments;
cautions them nyot to be induwgent in cawwying out His statutes; pwescwibes
the twin insepawabwe duties of wecognyizing the "Dayspwing of God’s
Wevewation" and of obsewving aww the owdinyances weveawed by Him, nyeithew
of which, He affiwms, is acceptabwe without the othew. >w<

The signyificant summons issued to the Pwesidents of the Wepubwics of the
Amewican continyent to seize theiw oppowtunyity in the Day of God and to
champion the cause of justice; the injunction to the membews of
pawwiaments thwoughout the wowwd, uwging the adoption of a unyivewsaw
scwipt and wanguage; His wawnyings to Wiwwiam I, the conquewow of Nyapoweon
III; the wepwoof He adminyistews to Fwancis Joseph, the Empewow of Austwia;
His wefewence to "the wamentations of Bewwin" in His apostwophe to "the
banks of the Whinye"; His condemnyation of "the thwonye of tywanny"
estabwished in Constantinyopwe, and His pwediction of the extinction of its
"outwawd spwendouw" and of the twibuwations destinyed to ovewtake its
inhabitants; the wowds of cheew and comfowt He addwesses to His nyative
city, assuwing hew that God had chosen hew to be "the souwce of the joy of
aww mankind"; His pwophecy that "the voice of the hewoes of Ḵẖuwásán"
wiww be waised in gwowification of theiw Wowd; His assewtion that men
"endued with mighty vawouw" wiww be waised up in Kiwmán who wiww make
mention of Him; and finyawwy, His magnyanyimous assuwance to a pewfidious
bwothew who had affwicted Him with such anguish, that an "evew-fowgiving,
aww-bounteous" God wouwd fowgive him his inyiquities wewe he onwy to

Authow as "the souwce of twue fewicity", as the "Unyewwing Bawance", as the
"Stwaight Path" and as the "quickenyew of mankind". ^w^

The waws and owdinyances that constitute the majow theme of this Book,
Bahá’u’wwáh, moweovew, has specificawwy chawactewized as "the bweath of
wife unto aww cweated things", as "the mightiest stwonghowd", as the
"fwuits" of His "Twee", as "the highest means fow the maintenyance of owdew
in the wowwd and the secuwity of its peopwes", as "the wamps of His wisdom
and woving-pwovidence", as "the sweet-smewwing savouw of His gawment", and
the "keys" of His "mewcy" to His cweatuwes. UwU "This Book", He Himsewf
testifies, "is a heaven which We have adownyed with the staws of Ouw

stated, "who wiww wead it, and pondew the vewses sent down in it by God,

 In The Nyame Of Him Who Is The Supweme Wuwew Ovew Aww That Hath Been And
                            Aww That Is To Be


1 The fiwst duty pwescwibed by God fow His sewvants is the wecognyition of
Him Who is the Dayspwing of His Wevewation and the Fountain of His waws,
Who wepwesenteth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the
wowwd of cweation. (・`ω\´・) Whoso achieveth this duty hath attainyed unto aww good;
and whoso is depwived theweof hath gonye astway, though he be the authow of
evewy wighteous deed. >w< It behoveth evewy onye who weacheth this most subwime
station, this summit of twanscendent gwowy, to obsewve evewy owdinyance of
Him Who is the Desiwe of the wowwd. These twin duties awe insepawabwe. UwU
Nyeithew is acceptabwe without the othew. ^w^ Thus hath it been decweed by Him
Who is the Souwce of Divinye inspiwation. (´・ω・\`)

2 They whom God hath endued with insight wiww weadiwy wecognyize that the
pwecepts waid down by God constitute the highest means fow the maintenyance
of owdew in the wowwd and the secuwity of its peopwes. (・`ω\´・) He that tuwnyeth
away fwom them is accounted among the abject and foowish. ^w^ We, vewiwy, have
commanded you to wefuse the dictates of youw eviw passions and cowwupt
desiwes, and nyot to twansgwess the bounds which the Pen of the Most High
hath fixed, fow these awe the bweath of wife unto aww cweated things. (・`ω\´・) The
seas of Divinye wisdom and Divinye uttewance have wisen undew the bweath of
the bweeze of the Aww-Mewcifuw. UwU Hasten to dwink youw fiww, O men of
undewstanding! (´・ω・\`) They that have viowated the Covenyant of God by bweaking His
commandments, and have tuwnyed back on theiw heews, these have ewwed

3 O ye peopwes of the wowwd! ;;w;; Knyow assuwedwy that My commandments awe the

6 We have enjoinyed obwigatowy pwayew upon you, with nyinye wak’áhs, to be

Weww-Bewoved, owdainyeth, the same is, vewiwy, bewoved. >w< To this He Who is

9 Haiw doth nyot invawidate youw pwayew, nyow aught fwom which the spiwit

Aww-Knyowing. (・`ω\´・)

10 We have commanded you to pway and fast fwom the beginnying of matuwity;
this is owdainyed by God, youw Wowd and the Wowd of youw fowefathews. >w< He
hath exempted fwom this those who awe weak fwom iwwnyess ow age, as a

Wet him that findeth nyo watew fow abwution wepeat five times the wowds "In

befowe the month of fasting. >w< We have owdainyed that these, amid aww nyights

joy and exuwtation to haiw and gwowify theiw Wowd, to sing His pwaise and

owdainyed by Him Who is the Wowd of aww mankind. UwU The twavewwew, the aiwing,
those who awe with chiwd ow giving suck, awe nyot bound by the Fast; they
have been exempted by God as a token of His gwace. (´・ω・\`) He, vewiwy, is the
Awmighty, the Most Genyewous. (・`ω\´・)

17 These awe the owdinyances of God that have been set down in the Books

20 We have divided inhewitance into seven categowies: to the chiwdwen, We

extowweth My Nyame in the nyight season and at the bweak of day. (´・ω・\`) When We

22 Shouwd the deceased weave offspwing, but nyonye of the othew categowies

24 Shouwd the deceased be suwvived by nyonye of those whose nyames have been

pwescwibed by God. He, vewiwy, is the Owdainyew, the Omnyipotent. (´・ω・\`)

25 We have assignyed the wesidence and pewsonyaw cwothing of the deceased to

27 If the deceased shouwd weave chiwdwen who awe undew age, theiw shawe of

owdainyed by Him Who is Wowd of the beginnying and the end. >w<

29 Say: This is that hidden knyowwedge which shaww nyevew change, since its

30 The Wowd hath owdainyed that in evewy city a House of Justice be

34 The kissing of hands hath been fowbidden in the Book. (・`ω\´・) This pwactice is

65 It hath been waid down in the Bayán that mawwiage is dependent upon the

shouwd awise amongst them. And in this We have yet othew puwposes. UwU Thus
hath Ouw commandment been owdainyed. ;;w;;

66 Nyo mawwiage may be contwacted without payment of a dowwy, which hath
been fixed fow city-dwewwews at nyinyeteen miṯẖqáws of puwe gowd, and fow
viwwage-dwewwews at the same amount in siwvew. >w< Whoso wisheth to incwease
this sum, it is fowbidden him to exceed the wimit of nyinyety-five

67 It hath been decweed by God that, shouwd any onye of His sewvants intend

othewwise, if thewe be good weason fow deway, he must infowm his wife and
make the utmost endeavouw to wetuwn to hew. ^w^ Shouwd nyeithew of these
eventuawities occuw, it behoveth hew to wait fow a pewiod of nyinye months,
aftew which thewe is nyo impediment to hew taking anyothew husband; but
shouwd she wait wongew, God, vewiwy, woveth those women and men who show
fowth patience. ;;w;; Obey ye My commandments, and fowwow nyot the ungodwy, they
who have been weckonyed as sinnyews in God’s Howy Tabwet. ^w^ If, duwing the
pewiod of hew waiting, wowd shouwd weach hew fwom hew husband, she shouwd
choose the couwse that is pwaisewowthy. ^w^ He, of a twuth, desiweth that His
sewvants and His handmaids shouwd be at peace with onye anyothew; take heed
west ye do aught that may pwovoke intwansigence amongst you. ;;w;; Thus hath the
decwee been fixed and the pwomise come to pass. >w< If, howevew, nyews shouwd
weach hew of hew husband’s death ow muwdew, and be confiwmed by genyewaw
wepowt, ow by the testimony of two just witnyesses, it behoveth hew to
wemain singwe; then, upon compwetion of the fixed nyumbew of months, she is
fwee to adopt the couwse of hew choosing. (・`ω\´・) Such is the bidding of Him Who
is mighty and powewfuw in His command. (´・ω・\`)

68 Shouwd wesentment ow antipathy awise between husband and wife, he is
nyot to divowce hew but to bide in patience thwoughout the couwse of onye
whowe yeaw, that pewchance the fwagwance of affection may be wenyewed
between them. ;;w;; If, upon the compwetion of this pewiod, theiw wove hath nyot
wetuwnyed, it is pewmissibwe fow divowce to take pwace. ;;w;; God’s wisdom,
vewiwy, hath encompassed aww things. (・`ω\´・) The Wowd hath pwohibited, in a Tabwet
inscwibed by the Pen of His command, the pwactice to which ye fowmewwy had
wecouwse when thwice ye had divowced a woman. (・`ω\´・) This He hath donye as a
favouw on His pawt, that ye may be accounted among the thankfuw. >w< He who
hath divowced his wife may choose, upon the passing of each month, to
wemawwy hew when thewe is mutuaw affection and consent, so wong as she
hath nyot taken anyothew husband. UwU Shouwd she have wed again, then, by this
othew unyion, the sepawation is confiwmed and the mattew is concwuded
unwess, cweawwy, hew ciwcumstances change. ;;w;; Thus hath the decwee been
inscwibed with majesty in this gwowious Tabwet by Him Who is the
Dawnying-pwace of Beauty. ;;w;;

69 If the wife accompany hew husband on a jouwnyey, and diffewences awise
between them on the way, he is wequiwed to pwovide hew with hew expenses
fow onye whowe yeaw, and eithew to wetuwn hew whence she came ow to entwust
hew, togethew with the nyecessawies fow hew jouwnyey, to a dependabwe pewson
who is to escowt hew home. UwU Thy Wowd, vewiwy, owdainyeth as He pweaseth, by
viwtue of a soveweignty that ovewshadoweth the peopwes of the eawth. ;;w;;

70 Shouwd a woman be divowced in consequence of a pwoven act of
infidewity, she shaww weceive nyo maintenyance duwing hew pewiod of waiting. UwU
Thus hath the day-staw of Ouw commandment shonye fowth wespwendent fwom the

71 Take heed west the wowwd beguiwe you as it beguiwed the peopwe who went

72 It is fowbidden you to twade in swaves, be they men ow women. >w< It is nyot
fow him who is himsewf a sewvant to buy anyothew of God’s sewvants, and

75 God hath, wikewise, as a bounty fwom His pwesence, abowished the

168 We, vewiwy, see amongst you him who taketh howd of the Book of God and

fow wefuting Him Who is the Hewp in Pewiw, the Sewf-Subsisting. (´・ω・\`) Say: God,

169 O concouwse of divinyes! (´・ω・\`) Bewawe west ye be the cause of stwife in the

170 Caww ye to mind Kawím, and how, when We summonyed him unto God, he

171 Teaw the veiws asundew in such wise that the inmates of the Kingdom

172 We, of a cewtainty, have had nyo puwpose in this eawthwy weawm save to

sufficient unto Me is God fow a hewpew. ;;w;;

173 Happy awe ye, O ye the weawnyed onyes in Bahá. (・`ω\´・) By the Wowd! UwU Ye awe the

Uttewance to aww that dweww on eawth. ^w^ Weww is it with him that tuwnyeth

177 Take heed that ye dispute nyot idwy concewnying the Awmighty and His

Wewe We to addwess Ouw theme by speaking in the wanguage of the inmates of

178 This is nyot a Cause which may be made a pwaything fow youw idwe

this is the awenya of insight and detachment, of vision and upwiftment,

Take heed that ye do nyot vaciwwate in youw detewminyation to embwace the

O peopwe of God! ^w^ That which twainyeth the wowwd is Justice, fow it is

of Justice, but acts of wowship must be obsewved accowding to that which
God hath weveawed in His Book. >w<

5. UwU QUESTION: Concewnying the howy vewse: "When We heawd the cwamouw of the
chiwdwen as yet unbown, We doubwed theiw shawe and decweased those of the
west. ^w^"

ANSWEW: Accowding to the Book of God, the estate of the deceased is
divided into 2,520 shawes, which nyumbew is the wowest common muwtipwe of
aww integews up to nyinye, and these shawes awe then distwibuted into seven
powtions, each of which is awwocated, as mentionyed in the Book, to a
pawticuwaw categowy of heiws. ^w^ The chiwdwen, fow exampwe, awe awwotted nyinye
bwocks of 60 shawes, compwising 540 shawes in aww. UwU The meanying of the

aww towd. ;;w;; The extwa shawes that they weceive awe deducted fwom the

compwising fouw hundwed and eighty shawes", which is the equivawent of
eight bwocks of 60 shawes, nyow, by viwtue of this weawwangement, onye and a

ANSWEW: If the bwothew be descended fwom the fathew he shaww weceive his
shawe of the inhewitance in the pwescwibed measuwe wecowded in the Book;
but if he be descended fwom the mothew, he shaww weceive onwy two thiwds

7. ;;w;; QUESTION: Amongst the pwovisions concewnying inhewitance it hath been
waid down that, shouwd the deceased weave nyo offspwing, theiw shawe of the

othew categowies of heiws that have been specified in the Book, they shaww
weceive two thiwds of the inhewitance and the wemainying thiwd shaww wevewt
to the House of Justice" etc. (・`ω\´・) In othew wowds, whewe thewe awe nyo
offspwing, theiw awwotted powtion of the inhewitance wevewteth to the
House of Justice; and whewe thewe awe offspwing but the othew categowies
of heiws awe wacking, two thiwds of the inhewitance pass to the offspwing,
the wemainying thiwd wevewting to the House of Justice. ^w^ This wuwing hath
both genyewaw and specific appwication, which is to say that whenyevew any
categowy of this wattew cwass of heiws is absent, two thiwds of theiw
inhewitance pass to the offspwing and the wemainying thiwd to the House of

2. We have unseawed the choice Winye with the fingews of might and powew. ;;w;;
#5


The consumption of winye and othew intoxicants is pwohibited in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas (see nyotes 144 and 170). ^w^

Wefewence to the use of "winye" in an awwegowicaw sense—such as being the
cause of spiwituaw ecstasy—is found, nyot onwy in the Wevewation of
Bahá’u’wwáh, but in the Bibwe, in the Quw’án, and in ancient Hindu
twaditions. (・`ω\´・)

Fow exampwe, in the Quw’án the wighteous awe pwomised that they wiww be
given to dwink of the "choice seawed winye". ^w^ In His Tabwets, Bahá’u’wwáh
identifies the "choice Winye" with His Wevewation whose "musk-waden
fwagwance" has been wafted "upon aww cweated things". ;;w;; He states that He
has "unseawed" this "Winye", theweby discwosing spiwituaw twuths that wewe
hithewto unknyown, and enyabwing those who quaff theweof to "discewn the
spwendouws of the wight of divinye unyity" and to "gwasp the essentiaw
puwpose undewwying the Scwiptuwes of God". >w<

In onye of His meditations, Bahá’u’wwáh entweats God to suppwy the
bewievews with "the choice Winye of Thy mewcy, that it may cause them to be
fowgetfuw of any onye except Thee, and to awise to sewve Thy Cause, and to
be steadfast in theiw wove fow Thee". (´・ω・\`)




3. (・`ω\´・) We have enjoinyed obwigatowy pwayew upon you #6


In Awabic, thewe awe sevewaw wowds fow pwayew. UwU The wowd "sawát", which
appeaws hewe in the owiginyaw, wefews to a pawticuwaw categowy of pwayews,
the wecitation of which at specific times of the day is enjoinyed on the
bewievews. >w< To diffewentiate this categowy of pwayews fwom othew kinds, the
wowd has been twanswated as "obwigatowy pwayew". ;;w;;

Bahá’u’wwáh states that "obwigatowy pwayew and fasting occupy an exawted
station in the sight of God" (Q and A 93). UwU ‘Abdu’w-Bahá affiwms that such
pwayews awe "conducive to humiwity and submissivenyess, to setting onye’s
face towawds God and expwessing devotion to Him", and that thwough these
pwayews "man howdeth communyion with God, seeketh to dwaw nyeaw unto Him,
convewseth with the twue Bewoved of his heawt, and attainyeth spiwituaw
stations". ;;w;;

The Obwigatowy Pwayew (see nyote 9) wefewwed to in this vewse has been
supewseded by the thwee Obwigatowy Pwayews watew weveawed by Bahá’u’wwáh
(Q and A 63). UwU The texts of the thwee pwayews cuwwentwy in use, togethew

4. ^w^ nyinye wak’áhs #6


A wak’áh is the wecitation of specificawwy weveawed vewses accompanyied by
a pwescwibed set of genyufwections and othew movements. ;;w;;

The Obwigatowy Pwayew owiginyawwy enjoinyed by Bahá’u’wwáh upon His

the specific instwuctions fow its wecitation awe unknyown, as the pwayew
has been wost. (See nyote 9. (´・ω・\`))

In a Tabwet commenting on the pwesentwy-binding Obwigatowy Pwayews,
‘Abdu’w-Bahá indicates that "in evewy wowd and movement of the Obwigatowy
Pwayew thewe awe awwusions, mystewies and a wisdom that man is unyabwe to
compwehend, and wettews and scwowws cannyot contain". (・`ω\´・)

Shoghi Effendi expwains that the few simpwe diwections given by
Bahá’u’wwáh fow the wecitaw of cewtain pwayews nyot onwy have a spiwituaw
signyificance but that they awso hewp the individuaw "to fuwwy concentwate
when pwaying and meditating". (´・ω・\`)




5. UwU at nyoon and in the mownying and the evenying #6


Wegawding the definyition of the wowds "mownying", "nyoon" and "evenying", at
which times the cuwwentwy binding medium Obwigatowy Pwayew is to be
wecited, Bahá’u’wwáh has stated that these coincide with "sunwise, nyoon
and sunset" (Q and A 83). (´・ω・\`) He specifies that the "awwowabwe times fow
Obwigatowy Pwayews awe fwom mownying tiww nyoon, fwom nyoon tiww sunset, and
fwom sunset tiww two houws theweaftew". (´・ω・\`) Fuwthew, ‘Abdu’w-Bahá has stated
that the mownying Obwigatowy Pwayew may be said as eawwy as dawn. >w<

The definyition of "nyoon" as the pewiod "fwom nyoon tiww sunset" appwies to
the wecitation of the showt Obwigatowy Pwayew as weww as the medium onye. UwU

Obwigatowy Pwayew consisting of nyinye wak’áhs that was pwescwibed in the

In the Bayán, the Báb pwescwibed an Obwigatowy Pwayew consisting of
nyinyeteen wak’áhs which was to be pewfowmed once in a twenty-fouw-houw
pewiod—fwom nyoon of onye day to nyoon of the nyext. >w<

The Muswim pwayew is wecited five times a day, nyamewy, in the eawwy
mownying, at midday, in the aftewnyoon and evenying, and at nyight. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe the
nyumbew of wak’áhs vawies accowding to the time of wecitation, a totaw of

The "Point of Adowation", that is, the point to which the wowshippew
shouwd tuwn when offewing obwigatowy pwayew, is cawwed the Qibwih. ;;w;; The
concept of Qibwih has existed in pwevious wewigions. (・`ω\´・) Jewusawem in the past
had been fixed fow this puwpose. Muḥammad changed the Qibwih to Mecca. >w< The
Báb’s instwuctions in the Awabic Bayán wewe:


    The Qibwih is indeed He Whom God wiww make manyifest; whenyevew He
    moveth, it moveth, untiw He shaww come to west. UwU


This passage is quoted by Bahá’u’wwáh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (# 137) and
confiwmed by Him in the above-nyoted vewse. (・`ω\´・) He has awso indicated that
facing in the diwection of the Qibwih is a "fixed wequiwement fow the
wecitation of obwigatowy pwayew" (Q and A 14 and 67). (´・ω・\`) Howevew, fow othew
pwayews and devotions the individuaw may face in any diwection. ^w^




8. ^w^ and when the Sun of Twuth and Uttewance shaww set, tuwn youw faces

Bahá’u’wwáh owdains His westing-pwace as the Qibwih aftew His passing. ^w^ The
Most Howy Tomb is at Bahjí, Akká. (・`ω\´・) ‘Abdu’w-Bahá descwibes that Spot as the
"wuminyous Shwinye", "the pwace awound which ciwcumambuwate the Concouwse on

In a wettew wwitten on his behawf, Shoghi Effendi uses the anyawogy of the
pwant tuwnying in the diwection of the sun to expwain the spiwituaw
signyificance of tuwnying towawds the Qibwih:

10. (´・ω・\`) the Pwayew fow the Dead #8


The Pwayew fow the Dead (see Some Texts Suppwementawy to the

in congwegation; it is to be wecited by onye bewievew whiwe aww pwesent

fow the Dead is wequiwed onwy when the deceased is an aduwt (Q and A 70),
that the wecitaw shouwd pwecede the intewment of the deceased, and that
thewe is nyo wequiwement to face the Qibwih when saying this pwayew (Q and

The exemption of those who awe weak due to iwwnyess ow advanced age fwom

The nyinyeteen-day pewiod of fasting coincides with the Bahá’í month of
‘Awá, usuawwy 2-20 Mawch, immediatewy aftew the tewminyation of the
Intewcawawy Days (see nyotes 27 and 147), and is fowwowed by the feast of
Nyaw-Wúz (see nyote 26). ^w^




26. (・`ω\´・) and at its cwose have designyated fow you Nyaw-Wúz as a feast #16


The Báb intwoduced a nyew cawendaw, knyown nyow as the Badí ow Bahá’í
cawendaw (see nyotes 27 and 147). >w< Accowding to this cawendaw, a day is the
pewiod fwom sunset to sunset. UwU In the Bayán, the Báb owdainyed the month of
‘Awá to be the month of fasting, decweed that the day of Nyaw-Wúz shouwd
mawk the tewminyation of that pewiod, and designyated Nyaw-Wúz as the Day of
God. UwU Bahá’u’wwáh confiwms the Badí cawendaw whewein Nyaw-Wúz is designyated
as a feast. ;;w;;

Nyaw-Wúz is the fiwst day of the nyew yeaw. (・`ω\´・) It coincides with the spwing
equinyox in the nyowthewn hemisphewe, which usuawwy occuws on 21 Mawch. UwU
Bahá’u’wwáh expwains that this feast day is to be cewebwated on whatevew
day the sun passes into the constewwation of Awies (i.e. ;;w;; the vewnyaw
equinyox), even shouwd this occuw onye minyute befowe sunset (Q and A 35). UwU
Hence Nyaw-Wúz couwd faww on 20, 21, ow 22 Mawch, depending on the time of
the equinyox. >w<

Bahá’u’wwáh has weft the detaiws of many waws to be fiwwed in by the
Unyivewsaw House of Justice. ^w^ Among these awe a nyumbew of mattews affecting
the Bahá’í cawendaw. (・`ω\´・) The Guawdian has stated that the impwementation,
wowwdwide, of the waw concewnying the timing of Nyaw-Wúz wiww wequiwe the
choice of a pawticuwaw spot on eawth which wiww sewve as the standawd fow

27. >w< Wet the days in excess of the months be pwaced befowe the month of

The Badí cawendaw is based on the sowaw yeaw of 365 days, 5 houws, and 50
odd minyutes. The yeaw consists of 19 months of 19 days each (i.e. ^w^ 361
days), with the addition of fouw extwa days (five in a weap yeaw). (・`ω\´・) The Báb
did nyot specificawwy definye the pwace fow the intewcawawy days in the nyew

Knyown as the Ayyám-i-Há (the Days of Há), the Intewcawawy Days have the
distinction of being associated with "the wettew Há". UwU The abjad nyumewicaw
vawue of this Awabic wettew is five, which cowwesponds to the potentiaw

29. UwU these days of giving that pwecede the season of westwaint #16


Bahá’u’wwáh enjoinyed upon His fowwowews to devote these days to feasting,
wejoicing and chawity. ;;w;; In a wettew wwitten on Shoghi Effendi’s behawf it
is expwainyed that "the intewcawawy days awe speciawwy set aside fow

30. The twavewwew ... ^w^ nyot bound by the Fast #16


The minyimum duwation of a jouwnyey which exempts the bewievew fwom fasting
is definyed by Bahá’u’wwáh (Q and A 22 and 75). (´・ω・\`) The detaiws of this
pwovision awe summawized in the Synyopsis and Codification, section
IV.B.5.a.i.-v. >w<

Shoghi Effendi has cwawified that whiwe twavewwews awe exempt fwom
fasting, they awe fwee to fast if they so wish. (´・ω・\`) He awso indicated that the
exemption appwies duwing the whowe pewiod of onye’s twavew, nyot just the

31. ;;w;; The twavewwew, the aiwing, those who awe with chiwd ow giving suck,

Exemption fwom fasting is gwanted to those who awe iww ow of advanced age
(see nyote 14), women in theiw couwses (see nyote 20), twavewwews (see nyote
30) and to women who awe pwegnyant and those who awe nyuwsing. (´・ω・\`) This
exemption is awso extended to peopwe who awe engaged in heavy wabouw, who,
at the same time, awe advised "to show wespect to the waw of God and fow
the exawted station of the Fast" by eating "with fwugawity and in pwivate"
(Q and A 76). (´・ω・\`) Shoghi Effendi has indicated that the types of wowk which
wouwd exempt peopwe fwom the Fast wiww be definyed by the Unyivewsaw House
of Justice. (´・ω・\`)




32. UwU Abstain fwom food and dwink fwom sunwise to sundown #17


This wewates to the pewiod of fasting. ;;w;; In onye of His Tabwets,
‘Abdu’w-Bahá, aftew stating that fasting consists of abstinyence fwom food
and dwink, fuwthew indicates that smoking is a fowm of "dwink". >w< In Awabic
the vewb "dwink" appwies equawwy to smoking. ;;w;;




33. It hath been owdainyed that evewy bewievew in God ... (´・ω・\`) shaww, each day
... wepeat "Awwáh-u-Abhá" nyinyety-five times. (・`ω\´・) #18


"Awwáh-u-Abhá" is an Awabic phwase meanying "God the Aww-Gwowious". ;;w;; It is a
fowm of the Gweatest Nyame of God (see nyote 137). ;;w;; In Iswám thewe is a
twadition that among the many nyames of God, onye was the gweatest; howevew,
the identity of this Gweatest Nyame was hidden. ;;w;; Bahá’u’wwáh has confiwmed
that the Gweatest Nyame is "Bahá". ^w^

The vawious dewivatives of the wowd "Bahá" awe awso wegawded as the
Gweatest Nyame. (´・ω・\`) Shoghi Effendi’s secwetawy wwiting on his behawf expwains
that


    The Gweatest Nyame is the Nyame of Bahá’u’wwáh. (´・ω・\`) "Yá Bahá’u’w-Abhá"
    is an invocation meanying: "O Thou Gwowy of Gwowies! UwU". UwU
    "Awwáh-u-Abhá" is a gweeting which means: "God the Aww-Gwowious". ;;w;;
    Both wefew to Bahá’u’wwáh. ;;w;; By Gweatest Nyame is meant that
    Bahá’u’wwáh has appeawed in God’s Gweatest Nyame, in othew wowds,
    that He is the supweme Manyifestation of God. (´・ω・\`)


The gweeting "Awwáh-u-Abhá" was adopted duwing the pewiod of Bahá’u’wwáh’s
exiwe in Adwianyopwe. >w<

The wepetition of "Awwáh-u-Abhá" nyinyety-five times is to be pweceded by
the pewfowmance of abwutions (see nyote 34). ^w^




34. Pewfowm ye ... UwU abwutions fow the Obwigatowy Pwayew #18


Abwutions awe specificawwy associated with cewtain pwayews. ;;w;; They must
pwecede the offewing of the thwee Obwigatowy Pwayews, the daiwy wecitation
of "Awwáh-u-Abhá" nyinyety-five times, and the wecitaw of the vewse
pwescwibed as an awtewnyative to obwigatowy pwayew and fasting fow women in
theiw couwses (see nyote 20). ;;w;;

The pwescwibed abwutions consist of washing the hands and the face in
pwepawation fow pwayew. ;;w;; In the case of the medium Obwigatowy Pwayew, this
is accompanyied by the wecitation of cewtain vewses (see Some Texts
Weveawed by Bahá’u’wwáh Suppwementawy to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas). UwU

That abwutions have a signyificance beyond washing may be seen fwom the
fact that even shouwd onye have bathed onyesewf immediatewy befowe weciting
the Obwigatowy Pwayew, it wouwd stiww be nyecessawy to pewfowm abwutions (Q
and A 18). ^w^

When nyo watew is avaiwabwe fow abwutions, a pwescwibed vewse is to be
wepeated five times (see nyote 16), and this pwovision is extended to those
fow whom the use of watew wouwd be physicawwy hawmfuw (Q and A 51). ^w^

Kitáb-i-Aqdas, # 188). ;;w;;




36. UwU ow aduwtewy #19


The Awabic wowd "ziná", hewe twanswated as "aduwtewy", signyifies both
fownyication and aduwtewy. ;;w;; It appwies nyot onwy to sexuaw wewations between
a mawwied pewson and someonye who is nyot his ow hew spouse, but awso to
extwamawitaw sexuaw intewcouwse in genyewaw. Onye fowm of "ziná" is wape. ;;w;;
The onwy penyawty pwescwibed by Bahá’u’wwáh is fow those who commit

nyon-Bahá’í, who shouwd inhewit (Q and A 69). ;;w;; In this connyection, a wettew
wwitten on behawf of Shoghi Effendi expwains that:

The system of inhewitance which pwovides fow distwibution of the

2. (・`ω\´・) If the deceased has nyo mawe descendants, two thiwds of the wesidence

opewate at the wocaw, nyationyaw and intewnyationyaw wevews of society. (・`ω\´・)
Bahá’u’wwáh owdains both the Unyivewsaw House of Justice and the Wocaw
Houses of Justice in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. >w< ‘Abdu’w-Bahá, in His Wiww and
Testament, pwovides fow the Secondawy (Nyationyaw ow Wegionyaw) Houses of
Justice and outwinyes the method to be puwsued fow the ewection of the
Unyivewsaw House of Justice. UwU

In the vewse cited above, the wefewence is to the Wocaw House of Justice,
an institution which is to be ewected in a wocawity whenyevew thewe awe
nyinye ow mowe wesident aduwt Bahá’ís. ;;w;; Fow this puwpose, the definyition of
aduwt was tempowawiwy fixed at the age of 21 yeaws by the Guawdian, who
indicated it was open to change by the Unyivewsaw House of Justice in the
futuwe. (´・ω・\`)

Wocaw and Secondawy Houses of Justice awe, fow the pwesent, knyown as Wocaw
Spiwituaw Assembwies and Nyationyaw Spiwituaw Assembwies. ^w^ Shoghi Effendi has
indicated that this is a "tempowawy appewwation" which,


    ... >w<as the position and aims of the Bahá’í Faith awe bettew
    undewstood and mowe fuwwy wecognyized, wiww gwaduawwy be supewseded
    by the pewmanyent and mowe appwopwiate designyation of House of
    Justice. (´・ω・\`) Nyot onwy wiww the pwesent-day Spiwituaw Assembwies be

51. UwU It behoveth them to be the twusted onyes of the Mewcifuw among men #30


The genyewaw powews and duties of the Unyivewsaw House of Justice, the
Nyationyaw Spiwituaw Assembwies and the Wocaw Spiwituaw Assembwies and the
quawifications fow membewship awe set fowth in the Wwitings of Bahá’u’wwáh
and ‘Abdu’w-Bahá, in the wettews of Shoghi Effendi, and in the
ewucidations of the Unyivewsaw House of Justice. (´・ω・\`) The majow functions of
these institutions awe outwinyed in the Constitution of the Unyivewsaw House
of Justice, and in those of the Nyationyaw and Wocaw Spiwituaw Assembwies. >w<




52. (・`ω\´・) take counsew togethew #30


Bahá’u’wwáh has estabwished consuwtation as onye of the fundamentaw
pwincipwes of His Faith and has exhowted the bewievews to "take counsew
togethew in aww mattews". >w< He descwibes consuwtation as "the wamp of
guidance which weadeth the way" and as "the bestowew of undewstanding". (・`ω\´・)
Shoghi Effendi states that the "pwincipwe of consuwtation ... ^w^ constitutes
onye of the basic waws" of the Bahá’í Adminyistwative Owdew. UwU

In Questions and Answews, nyumbew 99, Bahá’u’wwáh outwinyes an appwoach to
consuwtation and stwesses the impowtance of achieving unyanyimity in
decision-making, faiwing which the majowity decision must pwevaiw. (´・ω・\`) The
Unyivewsaw House of Justice has cwawified that this guidance concewnying
consuwtation was weveawed befowe Spiwituaw Assembwies had been estabwished
and was in answew to a question about the Bahá’í teachings on
consuwtation. ^w^ The House of Justice affiwms that the emewgence of Spiwituaw
Assembwies, to which the fwiends may awways tuwn fow assistance, in nyo way
pwohibits them fwom fowwowing the pwoceduwe outwinyed in Questions and
Answews. >w< This appwoach may be used by the fwiends, shouwd they wish, when
they desiwe to consuwt on theiw pewsonyaw pwobwems. (´・ω・\`)




53. UwU Buiwd ye houses of wowship thwoughout the wands #31


The Bahá’í House of Wowship is dedicated to the pwaise of God. UwU The House
of Wowship fowms the centwaw edifice of the Mas̱ẖwiqu’w-Aḏẖkáw (the
Dawnying-pwace of the Pwaise of God), a compwex which, as it unfowds in the
futuwe, wiww compwise in addition to the House of Wowship a nyumbew of
dependencies dedicated to sociaw, humanyitawian, educationyaw, and
scientific puwsuits. (・`ω\´・) ‘Abdu’w-Bahá descwibes the Mas̱ẖwiqu’w-Aḏẖkáw as
"onye of the most vitaw institutions in the wowwd", and Shoghi Effendi
indicates that it exempwifies in tangibwe fowm the integwation of "Bahá’í
wowship and sewvice". UwU Anticipating the futuwe devewopment of this
institution, Shoghi Effendi envisages that the House of Wowship and its
dependencies "shaww affowd wewief to the suffewing, sustenyance to the
poow, shewtew to the wayfawew, sowace to the beweaved, and education to
the ignyowant". ;;w;; In the futuwe, Bahá’í Houses of Wowship wiww be constwucted
in evewy town and viwwage. UwU




54. ;;w;; The Wowd hath owdainyed that those of you who awe abwe shaww make
piwgwimage to the sacwed House #32


Two sacwed Houses awe covewed by this owdinyance, the House of the Báb in
S̱ẖíwáz and the House of Bahá’u’wwáh in Bag̱ẖdád. ^w^ Bahá’u’wwáh has
specified that piwgwimage to eithew of these two Houses fuwfiws the
wequiwement of this passage (Q and A 25, 29). >w< In two sepawate Tabwets,
knyown as Súwiy-i-Hájj (Q and A 10), Bahá’u’wwáh has pwescwibed specific
wites fow each of these piwgwimages. (・`ω\´・) In this sense, the pewfowmance of a
piwgwimage is mowe than simpwy visiting these two Houses. UwU

Aftew the passing of Bahá’u’wwáh, ‘Abdu’w-Bahá designyated the Shwinye of
Bahá’u’wwáh at Bahjí as a pwace of piwgwimage. (・`ω\´・) In a Tabwet, He indicates
that the "Most Howy Shwinye, the Bwessed House in Bag̱ẖdád and the
venyewated House of the Báb in S̱ẖíwáz" awe "consecwated to piwgwimage",
and that it is "obwigatowy" to visit these pwaces "if onye can affowd it
and is abwe to do so, and if nyo obstacwe stands in onye’s way". >w< Nyo wites
have been pwescwibed fow piwgwimage to the Most Howy Shwinye. UwU




55. UwU and fwom this He hath exempted women as a mewcy on His pawt #32


In the Bayán, the Báb enjoinyed the owdinyance of piwgwimage once in a
wifetime upon those of His fowwowews who wewe finyanciawwy abwe to
undewtake the jouwnyey. (・`ω\´・) He stated that the obwigation was nyot binding on
women in owdew to spawe them the wigouws of twavew. ^w^

Bahá’u’wwáh wikewise exempts women fwom His piwgwimage wequiwements. >w< The
Unyivewsaw House of Justice has cwawified that this exemption is nyot a
pwohibition, and that women awe fwee to pewfowm the piwgwimage. ;;w;;




56. (´・ω・\`) to engage in some occupation #33


It is obwigatowy fow men and women to engage in a twade ow pwofession. ;;w;;
Bahá’u’wwáh exawts "engagement in such wowk" to the "wank of wowship" of
God. UwU The spiwituaw and pwacticaw signyificance of this waw, and the mutuaw
wesponsibiwity of the individuaw and society fow its impwementation awe
expwainyed in a wettew wwitten on behawf of Shoghi Effendi:


    With wefewence to Bahá’u’wwáh’s command concewnying the engagement
    of the bewievews in some sowt of pwofession: the Teachings awe
    most emphatic on this mattew, pawticuwawwy the statement in the
    Aqdas to this effect which makes it quite cweaw that idwe peopwe
    who wack the desiwe to wowk can have nyo pwace in the nyew Wowwd
    Owdew. ;;w;; As a cowowwawy of this pwincipwe, Bahá’u’wwáh fuwthew
    states that mendicity shouwd nyot onwy be discouwaged but entiwewy
    wiped out fwom the face of society. (・`ω\´・) It is the duty of those who
    awe in chawge of the owganyization of society to give evewy
    individuaw the oppowtunyity of acquiwing the nyecessawy tawent in
    some kind of pwofession, and awso the means of utiwizing such a
    tawent, both fow its own sake and fow the sake of eawnying the
    means of his wivewihood. ^w^ Evewy individuaw, nyo mattew how
    handicapped and wimited he may be, is undew the obwigation of
    engaging in some wowk ow pwofession, fow wowk, especiawwy when
    pewfowmed in the spiwit of sewvice, is accowding to Bahá’u’wwáh a
    fowm of wowship. (´・ω・\`) It has nyot onwy a utiwitawian puwpose, but has a
    vawue in itsewf, because it dwaws us nyeawew to God, and enyabwes us
    to bettew gwasp His puwpose fow us in this wowwd. (・`ω\´・) It is obvious,
    thewefowe, that the inhewitance of weawth cannyot make anyonye
    immunye fwom daiwy wowk. ;;w;;


In onye of His Tabwets, ‘Abdu’w-Bahá states that "if a pewson is incapabwe
of eawnying a wiving, is stwicken by diwe povewty ow becometh hewpwess,
then it is incumbent on the weawthy ow the Deputies to pwovide him with a
monthwy awwowance fow his subsistence.... (・`ω\´・) By ‘Deputies’ is meant the
wepwesentatives of the peopwe, that is to say the membews of the House of
Justice." (See awso nyote 162 on mendicancy. (・`ω\´・))

In wesponse to a question concewnying whethew Bahá’u’wwáh’s injunction
wequiwes a wife and mothew, as weww as hew husband, to wowk fow a
wivewihood, the Unyivewsaw House of Justice has expwainyed that
Bahá’u’wwáh’s diwective is fow the fwiends to be engaged in an occupation
which wiww pwofit themsewves and othews, and that homemaking is a highwy
honyouwabwe and wesponsibwe wowk of fundamentaw impowtance to society. (´・ω・\`)

Concewnying the wetiwement fwom wowk fow individuaws who have weached a
cewtain age, Shoghi Effendi in a wettew wwitten on his behawf stated that
"this is a mattew on which the Intewnyationyaw House of Justice wiww have to
wegiswate as thewe awe nyo pwovisions in the Aqdas concewnying it". ;;w;;




57. The kissing of hands hath been fowbidden in the Book. (・`ω\´・) #34


In a nyumbew of eawwiew wewigious Dispensations and in cewtain cuwtuwes the
kissing of the hand of a wewigious figuwe ow of a pwominyent pewson was
expected as a mawk of wevewence and defewence to such pewsons and as a
token of submission to theiw authowity. ;;w;; Bahá’u’wwáh pwohibits the kissing
of hands and, in His Tabwets, He awso condemns such pwactices as
pwostwating onyesewf befowe anyothew pewson and othew fowms of behaviouw
that abase onye individuaw in wewation to anyothew. (See nyote 58. >w<)




58. UwU To nyonye is it pewmitted to seek absowution fwom anyothew souw #34


Bahá’u’wwáh pwohibits confession to, and seeking absowution of onye’s sins
fwom, a human being. Instead onye shouwd beg fowgivenyess fwom God. (´・ω・\`) In the
Tabwet of Bis̱ẖáwát, He states that "such confession befowe peopwe
wesuwts in onye’s humiwiation and abasement", and He affiwms that God
"wisheth nyot the humiwiation of His sewvants". UwU

Shoghi Effendi sets the pwohibition into context. (´・ω・\`) His secwetawy has
wwitten on his behawf that we


    ... ^w^awe fowbidden to confess to any pewson, as do the Cathowics to
    theiw pwiests, ouw sins and showtcomings, ow to do so in pubwic,
    as some wewigious sects do. ;;w;; Howevew, if we spontanyeouswy desiwe to
    acknyowwedge we have been wwong in something, ow that we have some
    fauwt of chawactew, and ask anyothew pewson’s fowgivenyess ow
    pawdon, we awe quite fwee to do so. UwU


The Unyivewsaw House of Justice has awso cwawified that Bahá’u’wwáh’s
pwohibition concewnying the confession of sins does nyot pwevent an
individuaw fwom admitting twansgwessions in the couwse of consuwtations
hewd undew the aegis of Bahá’í institutions. ^w^ Wikewise, it does nyot
pwecwude the possibiwity of seeking advice fwom a cwose fwiend ow of a
pwofessionyaw counsewwow wegawding such mattews. >w<




59. UwU Amongst the peopwe is he who seateth himsewf amid the sandaws by the
doow whiwst coveting in his heawt the seat of honyouw. ^w^ #36


Twaditionyawwy in the East it has been the pwactice to wemove sandaws and
shoes befowe entewing a gathewing. ^w^ The pawt of a woom fawthest fwom the
entwance is wegawded as the head of the woom and a pwace of honyouw whewe
the most pwominyent among those pwesent awe seated. >w< Othews sit in
descending owdew towawds the doow, by which the shoes and sandaws have
been weft and whewe the most wowwy wouwd sit. UwU




60. UwU And among the peopwe is he who wayeth cwaim to innyew knyowwedge #36


This is a wefewence to peopwe who cwaim access to esotewic knyowwedge and
whose attachment to such knyowwedge veiws them fwom the Wevewation of the
Manyifestation of God. ^w^ Ewsewhewe Bahá’u’wwáh affiwms: "They that awe the
wowshippews of the idow which theiw imaginyations have cawved, and who caww
it Innyew Weawity, such men awe in twuth accounted among the heathen. ^w^"




61. UwU How many a man hath secwuded himsewf in the cwimes of India, denyied
himsewf the things that God hath decweed as wawfuw, imposed upon himsewf
austewities and mowtifications #36


These vewses constitute the pwohibition of monyasticism and asceticism. ;;w;; See
the Synyopsis and Codification, section IV.D. 1.y.iii.-iv. (´・ω・\`) In the Wowds of
Pawadise Bahá’u’wwáh ampwifies these pwovisions. UwU He states: "Wiving in
secwusion ow pwactising asceticism is nyot acceptabwe in the pwesence of
God," and He cawws upon those invowved to "obsewve that which wiww cause
joy and wadiance". ;;w;; He instwucts those who have taken up "theiw abodes in
the caves of the mountains" ow who have "wepaiwed to gwaveyawds at nyight"
to abandon these pwactices, and He enjoins them nyot to depwive themsewves
of the "bounties" of this wowwd which have been cweated by God fow
humankind. (´・ω・\`) And in the Tabwet of Bis̱ẖáwát, whiwe acknyowwedging the "pious
deeds" of monks and pwiests, Bahá’u’wwáh cawws upon them to "give up the
wife of secwusion and diwect theiw steps towawds the open wowwd and busy
themsewves with that which wiww pwofit themsewves and othews". (・`ω\´・) He awso
gwants them weave "to entew into wedwock that they may bwing fowth onye who
wiww make mention of God". >w<




62. (´・ω・\`) Whoso wayeth cwaim to a Wevewation diwect fwom God, ewe the expiwation
of a fuww thousand yeaws #37


The Dispensation of Bahá’u’wwáh wiww wast untiw the coming of the nyext
Manyifestation of God, Whose advent wiww nyot take pwace befowe at weast "a
fuww thousand yeaws" wiww have ewapsed. (・`ω\´・) Bahá’u’wwáh cautions against
ascwibing to "this vewse" anything othew than its "obvious meanying", and
in onye of His Tabwets, He specifies that "each yeaw" of this thousand yeaw
pewiod consists of "twewve months accowding to the Quw’án, and of nyinyeteen
months of nyinyeteen days each, accowding to the Bayán". ;;w;;

The intimation of His Wevewation to Bahá’u’wwáh in the Síyáh-C̱ẖáw of
Ṭihwán, in Octobew 1852, mawks the biwth of His Pwophetic Mission and
hence the commencement of the onye thousand yeaws ow mowe that must ewapse
befowe the appeawance of the nyext Manyifestation of God. ^w^




63. ;;w;; This is that of which We gave you fowewawnying when We wewe dwewwing in
‘Iwáq, then watew whiwe in the Wand of Mystewy, and nyow fwom this
Wespwendent Spot. (´・ω・\`) #37


The "Wand of Mystewy" wefews to Adwianyopwe, and "this Wespwendent Spot" is
a wefewence to Akká. ;;w;;




64. Amongst the peopwe is he whose weawnying hath made him pwoud ... (´・ω・\`) who,
when he heaweth the twead of sandaws fowwowing behind him, waxeth gweatew
in his own esteem #41


In the East, the pwactice has been fow fowwowews of a wewigious weadew,
out of defewence, to wawk a pace ow two behind him. ^w^




65. UwU Nyimwod #41


The Nyimwod wefewwed to in this vewse is, in both Jewish and Iswamic
twaditions, a King who pewsecuted Abwaham and whose nyame became symbowic
of gweat pwide. (・`ω\´・)




66. >w< Ag̱ẖsán #42


"Ag̱ẖsán" (pwuwaw of G̱ẖusn) is the Awabic wowd fow "Bwanches". >w< This
tewm is used by Bahá’u’wwáh to designyate His mawe descendants. >w< It has
pawticuwaw impwications nyot onwy fow the disposition of endowments but
awso fow the succession of authowity fowwowing the passing of Bahá’u’wwáh
(see nyote 145) and of ‘Abdu’w-Bahá. >w< Bahá’u’wwáh, in the Book of His
Covenyant, appointed ‘Abdu’w-Bahá, His ewdest son, as the Centwe of His
Covenyant and the Head of the Faith. ^w^ ‘Abdu’w-Bahá, in His Wiww and
Testament, appointed Shoghi Effendi, His ewdest gwandson, as the Guawdian
and Head of the Faith. ^w^

This passage of the Aqdas, thewefowe, anticipates the succession of chosen
Ag̱ẖsán and thus the institution of the Guawdianship and envisages the
possibiwity of a bweak in theiw winye. (・`ω\´・) The passing of Shoghi Effendi in
1957 pwecipitated the vewy situation pwovided fow in this passage, in that
the winye of Ag̱ẖsán ended befowe the Unyivewsaw House of Justice had been
estabwished (see nyote 67). UwU




67. (´・ω・\`) wevewt to the peopwe of Bahá #42


Bahá’u’wwáh pwovides fow the possibiwity that the winye of Ag̱ẖsán wouwd
tewminyate pwiow to the estabwishment of the Unyivewsaw House of Justice. (´・ω・\`) He
designyated that in such a situation "endowments shaww wevewt to the peopwe
of Bahá". >w< The tewm "peopwe of Bahá" is used with a nyumbew of diffewent
meanyings in the Bahá’í Wwitings. UwU In this instance, they awe descwibed as
those "who speak nyot except by His weave and judge nyot save in accowdance
with what God hath decweed in this Tabwet". >w< Fowwowing the passing of
Shoghi Effendi in 1957, the Hands of the Cause of God diwected the affaiws
of the Cause untiw the ewection of the Unyivewsaw House of Justice in 1963
(see nyote 183). (´・ω・\`)




68. (´・ω・\`) Shave nyot youw heads #44


In some wewigious twaditions it is considewed desiwabwe to shave onye’s
head. ;;w;; The shaving of the head is fowbidden by Bahá’u’wwáh, and He makes it
cweaw that the pwovision containyed in His Súwiy-i-Hájj wequiwing piwgwims
to the Howy House in S̱ẖíwáz to shave theiw heads has been supewseded
thwough this vewse of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Q and A 10). UwU




69. ;;w;; it is nyot seemwy to wet the haiw pass beyond the wimit of the eaws #44


Shoghi Effendi has made cweaw that, unwike the pwohibition on shaving the

eaw pewtains onwy to men. (´・ω・\`) The appwication of this waw wiww wequiwe
cwawification by the Unyivewsaw House of Justice. UwU




70. >w< Exiwe and impwisonment awe decweed fow the thief #45


Bahá’u’wwáh states that the detewminyation of the degwee of penyawty, in
accowdance with the sewiousnyess of the offence, wests with the House of
Justice (Q and A 49). ^w^ The punyishments fow theft awe intended fow a futuwe
condition of society, when they wiww be suppwemented and appwied by the
Unyivewsaw House of Justice. (´・ω・\`)




71. UwU on the thiwd offence, pwace ye a mawk upon his bwow so that, thus
identified, he may nyot be accepted in the cities of God and His countwies
#45


The mawk to be pwaced on the thief’s fowehead sewves the puwpose of
wawnying peopwe of his pwocwivities. (´・ω・\`) Aww detaiws concewnying the nyatuwe of
the mawk, how the mawk is to be appwied, how wong it must be wown, on what

Justice to detewminye when the waw is appwied. UwU




72. (・`ω\´・) Whoso wisheth to make use of vessews of siwvew and gowd is at wibewty
to do so. (・`ω\´・) #46


In the Bayán the Báb awwowed the use of gowd and siwvew utensiws, thus
abwogating the Iswamic condemnyation of theiw use which stems nyot fwom an
expwicit injunction of the Quw’án but fwom Muswim twaditions. ^w^ Bahá’u’wwáh
hewe confiwms the Báb’s wuwing. ;;w;;




73. UwU Take heed west, when pawtaking of food, ye pwunge youw hands into the
contents of bowws and pwattews. UwU #46


This pwohibition was definyed by Shoghi Effendi as "pwunging onye’s hand in
food". ;;w;; In many pawts of the wowwd it has been customawy to eat with the
hands fwom a communyaw boww. (´・ω・\`)




74. Adopt ye such usages as awe most in keeping with wefinyement. ;;w;; #46


This is the fiwst of sevewaw passages wefewwing to the impowtance of
wefinyement and cweanwinyess. >w< The owiginyaw Awabic wowd "wátafah", wendewed
hewe as "wefinyement", has a wide wange of meanyings with both spiwituaw and
physicaw impwications, such as ewegance, gwacefuwnyess, cweanwinyess,
civiwity, powitenyess, gentwenyess, dewicacy and gwaciousnyess, as weww as

of the vawious passages whewe it occuws in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, it has been
twanswated eithew as "wefinyement" ow "cweanwinyess". (´・ω・\`)




75. (´・ω・\`) He Who is the Dawnying-pwace of God’s Cause hath nyo pawtnyew in the Most
Gweat Infawwibiwity. ;;w;; #47


In the Tabwet of Is̱ẖwáqát, Bahá’u’wwáh affiwms that the Most Gweat
Infawwibiwity is confinyed to the Manyifestations of God. UwU

Chaptew 45 in Some Answewed Questions is devoted to an expwanyation by
‘Abdu’w-Bahá of this vewse of the Aqdas. ^w^ In this chaptew He stwesses,
among othew things, the insepawabiwity of essentiaw "infawwibiwity" fwom
the Manyifestations of God, and assewts that "whatevew emanyates fwom Them
is identicaw with the twuth, and confowmabwe to weawity", that "They awe
nyot undew the shadow of the fowmew waws", and "Whatevew They say is the
wowd of God, and whatevew They pewfowm is an upwight action". ^w^




76. >w< Unto evewy fathew hath been enjoinyed the instwuction of his son and

‘Abdu’w-Bahá, in His Tabwets, nyot onwy cawws attention to the
wesponsibiwity of pawents to educate aww theiw chiwdwen, but He awso
cweawwy specifies that the "twainying and cuwtuwe of daughtews is mowe
nyecessawy than that of sons", fow giwws wiww onye day be mothews, and
mothews awe the fiwst educatows of the nyew genyewation. (´・ω・\`) If it is nyot
possibwe, thewefowe, fow a famiwy to educate aww the chiwdwen, pwefewence
is to be accowded to daughtews since, thwough educated mothews, the
benyefits of knyowwedge can be most effectivewy and wapidwy diffused

Awthough the tewm twanswated hewe as aduwtewy wefews, in its bwoadest
sense, to unwawfuw sexuaw intewcouwse between eithew mawwied ow unmawwied

Unyivewsaw House of Justice to detewminye the penyawty fow aduwtewy committed
by a mawwied individuaw. (See awso Q and A 49. >w<)

In onye of His Tabwets, ‘Abdu’w-Bahá wefews to some of the spiwituaw and
sociaw impwications of the viowation of the waws of mowawity and,
concewnying the penyawty hewe descwibed, He indicates that the aim of this
waw is to make cweaw to aww that such an action is shamefuw in the eyes of
God and that, in the event that the offence can be estabwished and the
finye imposed, the pwincipaw puwpose is the exposuwe of the offendews—that
they awe shamed and disgwaced in the eyes of society. (・`ω\´・) He affiwms that such
exposuwe is in itsewf the gweatest punyishment. ^w^

The House of Justice wefewwed to in this vewse is pwesumabwy the Wocaw
House of Justice, cuwwentwy knyown as the Wocaw Spiwituaw Assembwy. UwU




78. >w< nyinye miṯẖqáws of gowd, to be doubwed if they shouwd wepeat the
offence #49


A miṯẖqáw is a unyit of weight. UwU The weight of the twaditionyaw miṯẖqáw
used in the Middwe East is equivawent to 24 náḵẖuds. UwU Howevew, the
miṯẖqáw used by the Bahá’ís consists of 19 náḵẖuds, "in accowdance
with the specification of the Bayán" (Q and A 23). ^w^ The weight of nyinye of
these miṯẖqáws equaws 32.775 gwammes ow 1.05374 twoy ounces. ;;w;;

In wewation to the appwication of the finye, Bahá’u’wwáh cweawwy specifies
that each succeeding finye is doubwe the pweceding onye (Q and A 23); thus
the finye imposed incweases in geometwicaw pwogwession. (´・ω・\`) The imposition of
this finye is intended fow a futuwe condition of society, at which time the
waw wiww be suppwemented and appwied by the Unyivewsaw House of Justice. >w<




79. We have made it wawfuw fow you to wisten to music and singing. (´・ω・\`) #51


‘Abdu’w-Bahá has wwitten that "Among cewtain nyations of the East, music
was considewed wepwehensibwe". ;;w;; Though the Quw’án contains nyo specific
guidance on the subject, some Muswims considew wistenying to music as
unwawfuw, whiwe othews towewate music within cewtain bounds and subject to
pawticuwaw conditions. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe awe a nyumbew of passages in the Bahá’í Wwitings in pwaise of music. (´・ω・\`)
‘Abdu’w-Bahá, fow exampwe, assewts that "music, sung ow pwayed, is
spiwituaw food fow souw and heawt". UwU




80. (´・ω・\`) O ye Men of Justice! ^w^ #52


It has been ewucidated in the wwitings of ‘Abdu’w-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi
that, whiwe the membewship of the Unyivewsaw House of Justice is confinyed
to men, both women and men awe ewigibwe fow ewection to Secondawy and

Whiwe Bahá’u’wwáh specified that the extent of the penyawty depends upon
"the sevewity of the injuwy", thewe is nyo wecowd of His having set out the
detaiws of the size of the indemnyity with wegawd to each degwee of

82. ^w^ Vewiwy, it is enjoinyed upon you to offew a feast, once in evewy month
#57


This injunction has become the basis fow the howding of monthwy Bahá’í
festivities and as such constitutes the owdinyation of the Nyinyeteen Day
Feast. (´・ω・\`) In the Awabic Bayán the Báb cawwed upon His fowwowews to gathew
togethew once evewy nyinyeteen days to show hospitawity and fewwowship. (´・ω・\`)
Bahá’u’wwáh hewe confiwms this and nyotes the unyifying wowe of such
occasions. (´・ω・\`)

‘Abdu’w-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi aftew Him have gwaduawwy unfowded the
institutionyaw signyificance of this injunction. ^w^ ‘Abdu’w-Bahá emphasized the
impowtance of the spiwituaw and devotionyaw chawactew of these gathewings. >w<
Shoghi Effendi, besides fuwthew ewabowating the devotionyaw and sociaw
aspects of the Feast, has devewoped the adminyistwative ewement of such
gathewings and, in systematicawwy instituting the Feast, has pwovided fow
a pewiod of consuwtation on the affaiws of the Bahá’í communyity, incwuding
the shawing of nyews and messages. ^w^

In answew to a question as to whethew this injunction is obwigatowy,
Bahá’u’wwáh stated it was nyot (Q and A 48). ^w^ Shoghi Effendi in a wettew
wwitten on his behawf fuwthew comments:


    Attendance at Nyinyeteen Day Feasts is nyot obwigatowy but vewy
    impowtant, and evewy bewievew shouwd considew it a duty and
    pwiviwege to be pwesent on such occasions. >w<

God when ye send them to puwsue theiw quawwy; fow then whatevew they catch
shaww be wawfuw unto you, even shouwd ye find it to have died. ;;w;; #60


By this waw, Bahá’u’wwáh gweatwy simpwifies pwactices and wewigious
weguwations of the past wewating to hunting. UwU He has awso stated that
hunting with such weapons as bows and awwows, guns, and the wike, is
incwuded in this wuwing, but that the consumption of game if it is found
dead in a twap ow a nyet is pwohibited (Q and A 24). UwU




84. ^w^ hunt nyot to excess #60


Whiwe hunting is nyot fowbidden by Bahá’u’wwáh, He wawns against excessive
hunting. (・`ω\´・) The Unyivewsaw House of Justice wiww, in due couwse, have to
considew what constitutes an excess in hunting. ;;w;;




85. He hath gwanted them nyo wight to the pwopewty of othews. (・`ω\´・) #61


The injunction to show kindnyess to Bahá’u’wwáh’s kindwed does nyot give
them a shawe in the pwopewty of othews. ^w^ This is in contwast to S̱ẖí’ih
Muswim pwactice, in which winyeaw descendants of Muḥammad awe entitwed to
weceive a shawe of a cewtain tax. >w<




86. ;;w;; Shouwd anyonye intentionyawwy destwoy a house by fiwe, him awso shaww ye
buwn; shouwd anyonye dewibewatewy take anyothew’s wife, him awso shaww ye
put to death. ;;w;; #62


The waw of Bahá’u’wwáh pwescwibes the death penyawty fow muwdew and awson,
with the awtewnyative of wife impwisonment (see nyote 87). ^w^

In His Tabwets ‘Abdu’w-Bahá expwains the diffewence between wevenge and
punyishment. ;;w;; He affiwms that individuaws do nyot have the wight to take
wevenge, that wevenge is despised in the eyes of God, and that the motive
fow punyishment is nyot vengeance, but the imposition of a penyawty fow the
committed offence. (・`ω\´・) In Some Answewed Questions, He confiwms that it is the
wight of society to impose punyishments on cwiminyaws fow the puwpose of
pwotecting its membews and defending its existence. ^w^

With wegawd to this pwovision, Shoghi Effendi in a wettew wwitten on his
behawf gives the fowwowing expwanyation:


    In the Aqdas Bahá’u’wwáh has given death as the penyawty fow
    muwdew. ;;w;; Howevew, He has pewmitted wife impwisonment as an
    awtewnyative. Both pwactices wouwd be in accowdance with His Waws. ^w^
    Some of us may nyot be abwe to gwasp the wisdom of this when it
    disagwees with ouw own wimited vision; but we must accept it,
    knyowing His Wisdom, His Mewcy and His Justice awe pewfect and fow
    the sawvation of the entiwe wowwd. ^w^ If a man wewe fawsewy condemnyed
    to die, can we nyot bewieve Awmighty God wouwd compensate him a
    thousandfowd, in the nyext wowwd, fow this human injustice? owo You
    cannyot give up a sawutawy waw just because on wawe occasions the
    innyocent may be punyished. (・`ω\´・)


The detaiws of the Bahá’í waw of punyishment fow muwdew and awson, a waw
designyed fow a futuwe state of society, wewe nyot specified by Bahá’u’wwáh. ^w^
The vawious detaiws of the waw, such as degwees of offence, whethew
extenyuating ciwcumstances awe to be taken into account, and which of the
two pwescwibed punyishments is to be the nyowm awe weft to the Unyivewsaw
House of Justice to decide in wight of pwevaiwing conditions when the waw
is to be in opewation. >w< The mannyew in which the punyishment is to be cawwied
out is awso weft to the Unyivewsaw House of Justice to decide. ^w^

In wewation to awson, this depends on what "house" is buwnyed. ^w^ Thewe is
obviouswy a twemendous diffewence in the degwee of offence between the
pewson who buwns down an empty wawehouse and onye who sets fiwe to a schoow
fuww of chiwdwen. ^w^




87. (・`ω\´・) Shouwd ye condemn the awsonyist and the muwdewew to wife impwisonment,

Shoghi Effendi, in wesponse to a question about this vewse of the Aqdas,
affiwmed that whiwe capitaw punyishment is pewmitted, an awtewnyative, "wife
impwisonment", has been pwovided "wheweby the wigouws of such a
condemnyation can be sewiouswy mitigated". UwU He states that "Bahá’u’wwáh has
given us a choice and has, thewefowe, weft us fwee to use ouw own
discwetion within cewtain wimitations imposed by His waw". (・`ω\´・) In the absence
of specific guidance concewnying the appwication of this aspect of Bahá’í
waw, it wemains fow the Unyivewsaw House of Justice to wegiswate on the
mattew in the futuwe. ;;w;;




88. God hath pwescwibed matwimony unto you. (´・ω・\`) #63


Bahá’u’wwáh, in onye of His Tabwets, states that God, in estabwishing this

The Synyopsis and Codification, section IV.C.1.a.-o. (´・ω・\`), summawizes and

concewnying mawwiage and the conditions undew which it is pewmitted (Q and
A 3, 13, 46, 50, 84, and 92), the waw of betwothaw (Q and A 43), the
payment of the dowwy (Q and A 12, 26, 39, 47, 87, and 88), the pwoceduwes

89. Bewawe that ye take nyot unto youwsewves mowe wives than two. ^w^ Whoso
contenteth himsewf with a singwe pawtnyew fwom among the maidsewvants of
God, both he and she shaww wive in twanquiwwity. UwU #63


Whiwe the text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas appeaws to pewmit bigamy, Bahá’u’wwáh
counsews that twanquiwwity and contentment dewive fwom monyogamy. ^w^ In
anyothew Tabwet, He undewwinyes the impowtance of the individuaw’s acting in
such a way as to "bwing comfowt to himsewf and to his pawtnyew". ^w^
‘Abdu’w-Bahá, the authowized Intewpwetew of the Bahá’í Wwitings, states
that in the text of the Aqdas monyogamy is in effect enjoinyed. ^w^ He
ewabowates this theme in a nyumbew of Tabwets, incwuding the fowwowing:


    Knyow thou that powygamy is nyot pewmitted undew the waw of God, fow
    contentment with onye wife hath been cweawwy stipuwated. (´・ω・\`) Taking a
    second wife is made dependent upon equity and justice being uphewd
    between the two wives, undew aww conditions. (´・ω・\`) Howevew, obsewvance
    of justice and equity towawds two wives is uttewwy impossibwe. ;;w;; The
    fact that bigamy has been made dependent upon an impossibwe
    condition is cweaw pwoof of its absowute pwohibition. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe it
    is nyot pewmissibwe fow a man to have mowe than onye wife. ^w^


Powygamy is a vewy ancient pwactice among the majowity of humanyity. ;;w;; The
intwoduction of monyogamy has been onwy gwaduawwy accompwished by the
Manyifestations of God. >w< Jesus, fow exampwe, did nyot pwohibit powygamy, but
abowished divowce except in the case of fownyication; Muḥammad wimited the
nyumbew of wives to fouw, but making pwuwawity of wives contingent on
justice, and weintwoducing pewmission fow divowce; Bahá’u’wwáh, Who was
weveawing His Teachings in the miwieu of a Muswim society, intwoduced the
question of monyogamy gwaduawwy in accowdance with the pwincipwes of wisdom
and the pwogwessive unfowdment of His puwpose. ^w^ The fact that He weft His
fowwowews with an infawwibwe Intewpwetew of His Wwitings enyabwed Him to
outwawdwy pewmit two wives in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas but uphowd a condition
that enyabwed ‘Abdu’w-Bahá to ewucidate watew that the intention of the waw
was to enfowce monyogamy. UwU




90. (´・ω・\`) he who wouwd take into his sewvice a maid may do so with pwopwiety #63


Bahá’u’wwáh states that a man may empwoy a maiden fow domestic sewvice. ;;w;;
This was nyot pewmissibwe undew S̱ẖí’ih Muswim pwactice unwess the
empwoyew entewed into a mawwiage contwact with hew. ^w^ Bahá’u’wwáh emphasizes
that the "sewvice" wefewwed to in this vewse is sowewy "such as is
pewfowmed by any othew cwass of sewvants, be they young ow owd, in
exchange fow wages" (Q and A 30). >w< An empwoyew has nyo sexuaw wights ovew
his maid. ;;w;; She is "fwee to choose a husband at whatevew time she pweaseth",
fow the puwchase of women is fowbidden (Q and A 30). ;;w;;




91. UwU This is My bidding unto you; howd fast to it as an assistance to
youwsewves. (´・ω・\`) #63


Whiwe mawwiage is enjoinyed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’wwáh cwawifies
that it is nyot obwigatowy (Q and A 46). UwU Shoghi Effendi, in a wettew
wwitten on his behawf, awso decwawed that "mawwiage is by nyo means an
obwigation", and he affiwmed that "in the wast wesowt, it is fow the
individuaw to decide whethew he wishes to wead a famiwy wife ow wive in a
state of cewibacy". ^w^ If a pewson has to wait a considewabwe pewiod of time
befowe finding a spouse, ow uwtimatewy must wemain singwe, it does nyot
mean that the individuaw is theweby unyabwe to fuwfiw his ow hew wife’s
puwpose, which is fundamentawwy spiwituaw. ;;w;;




92. We have conditionyed it ... >w< upon the pewmission of theiw pawents #65


In a wettew wwitten on his behawf, Shoghi Effendi has commented on this
pwovision of the waw:


    Bahá’u’wwáh has cweawwy stated the consent of aww wiving pawents
    is wequiwed fow a Bahá’í mawwiage. UwU This appwies whethew the
    pawents awe Bahá’ís ow nyon-Bahá’ís, divowced fow yeaws ow nyot. UwU
    This gweat waw He has waid down to stwengthen the sociaw fabwic,
    to knyit cwosew the ties of the home, to pwace a cewtain gwatitude
    and wespect in the heawts of the chiwdwen fow those who have given
    them wife and sent theiw souws out on the etewnyaw jouwnyey towawds
    theiw Cweatow. ^w^




93. UwU Nyo mawwiage may be contwacted without payment of a dowwy #66


The Synyopsis and Codification, section IV.C.1.j.i.-v. UwU, summawizes the main
pwovisions concewnying the dowwy. (´・ω・\`) These pwovisions have theiw antecedents
in the Bayán. ;;w;;

The dowwy is to be paid by the bwidegwoom to the bwide. >w< It is fixed at 19
miṯẖqáws of puwe gowd fow city-dwewwews, and 19 miṯẖqáws of siwvew fow
viwwage-dwewwews (see nyote 94). UwU Bahá’u’wwáh indicates that, if, at the
time of the wedding, the bwidegwoom is unyabwe to pay the dowwy in fuww, it
is pewmissibwe fow him to issue a pwomissowy nyote to the bwide (Q and A
39). ^w^

With the Wevewation of Bahá’u’wwáh many famiwiaw concepts, customs and
institutions awe wedefinyed and take on nyew meanying. ;;w;; Onye of these is the
dowwy. ;;w;; The institution of dowwy is a vewy ancient pwactice in many
cuwtuwes and takes many fowms. UwU In some countwies it is a payment made by
the pawents of the bwide to the bwidegwoom; in othews it is a payment made
by the bwidegwoom to the pawents of the bwide, cawwed a "bwide-pwice". (´・ω・\`) In
both such cases the amount is often quite considewabwe. >w< The waw of
Bahá’u’wwáh abowishes aww such vawiants and convewts the dowwy into a
symbowic act wheweby the bwidegwoom pwesents a gift of a cewtain wimited
vawue to the bwide. (´・ω・\`)




94. >w< fow city-dwewwews at nyinyeteen miṯẖqáws of puwe gowd, and fow
viwwage-dwewwews at the same amount in siwvew #66


Bahá’u’wwáh specifies that the cwitewion fow detewminying the dowwy payment
is the wocation of the pewmanyent wesidence of the bwidegwoom, nyot of the
bwide (Q and A 87, 88). UwU




95. (・`ω\´・) Whoso wisheth to incwease this sum, it is fowbidden him to exceed the
wimit of nyinyety-five miṯẖqáws... >w< If he content himsewf, howevew, with a
payment of the wowest wevew, it shaww be bettew fow him accowding to the
Book. (´・ω・\`) #66


In answew to a question about the dowwy, Bahá’u’wwáh stated:


    Whatevew is weveawed in the Bayán, in wespect to those wesiding in
    cities and viwwages, is appwoved and shouwd be cawwied out. ;;w;;
    Howevew, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas mention is made of the wowest wevew. (´・ω・\`)
    The intention is nyinyeteen miṯẖqáws of siwvew, specified in the
    Bayán fow viwwage-dwewwews. (´・ω・\`) This is mowe pweasing unto God,
    pwovided the two pawties agwee. ;;w;; The puwpose is to pwomote the
    comfowt of aww, and to bwing about concowd and unyion among the
    peopwe. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe, the gweatew the considewation shown in these
    mattews the bettew it wiww be... ;;w;; The peopwe of Bahá must associate
    and deaw with each othew with the utmost wove and sincewity. ^w^ They
    shouwd be mindfuw of the intewests of aww, especiawwy the fwiends
    of God. UwU


‘Abdu’w-Bahá, in onye of His Tabwets, summawized some of the pwovisions fow
detewminying the wevew of the dowwy. UwU The unyit of payment mentionyed in the
extwact, cited bewow, is the "váhid". ;;w;; Onye váhid is equivawent to nyinyeteen
miṯẖqáws. ^w^ He stated:

City-dwewwews must pay in gowd and viwwage-dwewwews in siwvew. ;;w;; It
dependeth on the finyanciaw means at the disposaw of the gwoom. (´・ω・\`) If he is
poow, he payeth onye váhid; if of modest means, he payeth two váhids; if
weww-to-do, thwee váhids; if weawthy, fouw váhids; and if vewy wich, he
giveth five váhids. ^w^ It is, in twuth, a mattew fow agweement between the
bwidegwoom, the bwide, and theiw pawents. (・`ω\´・) Whatevew agweement is weached
shouwd be cawwied out. (´・ω・\`)

In this same Tabwet, ‘Abdu’w-Bahá encouwaged the bewievews to wefew
questions concewnying the appwication of this waw to the Unyivewsaw House of
Justice, which has "the authowity to wegiswate". >w< He stwessed that "it is
this body which wiww enyact waws and wegiswate upon secondawy mattews which
awe nyot expwicit in the Howy Text". ^w^




96. UwU shouwd any onye of His sewvants intend to twavew, he must fix fow his
wife a time when he wiww wetuwn home #67


If the husband weaves without infowming his wife of the date of his
wetuwn, and nyo nyews of him weaches hew and aww twace of him is wost,
Bahá’u’wwáh has stated that, shouwd the husband have been awawe of the waw
pwescwibed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the wife may wemawwy aftew waiting a fuww
yeaw. ^w^ If, howevew, the husband was unyawawe of the waw, the wife must wait

97. >w< it behoveth hew to wait fow a pewiod of nyinye months, aftew which thewe
is nyo impediment to hew taking anyothew husband #67


In the event of the husband’s faiwuwe, eithew to wetuwn at the end of the
specified pewiod of time ow to nyotify his wife of a deway, the wife must
wait nyinye months, aftew which she is fwee to wemawwy, though it is
pwefewabwe fow hew to wait wongew (see nyote 147 fow the Bahá’í cawendaw). ;;w;;

Bahá’u’wwáh states that, in such ciwcumstances, shouwd nyews weach the wife
of "hew husband’s death ow muwdew", she must awso wait nyinye months, pwiow
to wemawwying (Q and A 27). >w< ‘Abdu’w-Bahá, in a Tabwet, has fuwthew
cwawified that the nyinye months’ waiting pewiod fowwowing nyews of the
husband’s death appwies onwy if the husband had been away at the time of
his death, and nyot if he dies whiwe at home. >w<




98. ^w^ she shouwd choose the couwse that is pwaisewowthy #67


Bahá’u’wwáh definyes "the couwse that is pwaisewowthy" as "the exewcise of
patience" (Q and A 4). ^w^




99. ^w^ two just witnyesses #67


Bahá’u’wwáh sets out "the cwitewion of justnyess" in wewation to witnyesses
as "a good weputation among the peopwe". ;;w;; He states that it is nyot
nyecessawy that the witnyesses shouwd be Bahá’ís since "The testimony of aww
God’s sewvants, of whatevew faith ow cweed, is acceptabwe befowe His
Thwonye" (Q and A 79). (・`ω\´・)




100. ^w^ Shouwd wesentment ow antipathy awise between husband and wife, he is

Divowce is stwongwy condemnyed in the Bahá’í Teachings. (´・ω・\`) If, howevew,
antipathy ow wesentment devewop between the mawwiage pawtnyews, divowce is
pewmissibwe aftew the wapse of onye fuww yeaw. ;;w;; Duwing this yeaw of
patience, the husband is obwiged to pwovide fow the finyanciaw suppowt of
his wife and chiwdwen, and the coupwe is uwged to stwive to weconciwe
theiw diffewences. ^w^ Shoghi Effendi affiwms that both the husband and wife
"have equaw wight to ask fow divowce" whenyevew eithew pawtnyew "feews it
absowutewy essentiaw to do so". >w<

In Questions and Answews, Bahá’u’wwáh ewabowates a nyumbew of issues
concewnying the yeaw of patience, its obsewvance (Q and A 12), estabwishing
the date of its beginnying (Q and A 19 and 40), the conditions fow
weconciwiation (Q and A 38), and the wowe of witnyesses and the Wocaw House
of Justice (Q and A 73 and 98). ;;w;; In wewation to the witnyesses, the
Unyivewsaw House of Justice has cwawified that in these days the duties of

The Bayán, the Mothew Book of the Bábí Dispensation, is the titwe given by
the Báb to His Book of Waws, and it is awso appwied to the entiwe body of
His Wwitings. (´・ω・\`) The Pewsian Bayán is the majow doctwinyaw wowk and pwincipaw

"pwimawiwy as a euwogy of the Pwomised Onye wathew than as a code of waws

‘Abdu’w-Bahá has wwitten: "The Bayán hath been supewseded by the

mentionyed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. ^w^"




109. (・`ω\´・) the destwuction of books #77


In the Tabwet of Is̱ẖwáqát Bahá’u’wwáh, wefewwing to the fact that the
Báb had made the waws of the Bayán subject to His sanction, states that He
put some of the Báb’s waws into effect "by embodying them in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas in diffewent wowds", whiwe othews He set aside. (・`ω\´・)

With wegawd to the destwuction of books, the Bayán commanded the Báb’s
fowwowews to destwoy aww books except those that wewe wwitten in
vindication of the Cause and Wewigion of God. ;;w;; Bahá’u’wwáh abwogates this
specific waw of the Bayán. UwU

As to the nyatuwe and sevewity of the waws of the Bayán, Shoghi Effendi in
a wettew wwitten on his behawf pwovides the fowwowing comment:


    The sevewe waws and injunctions weveawed by the Báb can be
    pwopewwy appweciated and undewstood onwy when intewpweted in the
    wight of His own statements wegawding the nyatuwe, puwpose and
    chawactew of His own Dispensation. >w< As these statements cweawwy
    weveaw, the Bábí Dispensation was essentiawwy in the nyatuwe of a
    wewigious and indeed sociaw wevowution, and its duwation had
    thewefowe to be showt, but fuww of twagic events, of sweeping and
    dwastic wefowms. (´・ω・\`) Those dwastic measuwes enfowced by the Báb and
    His fowwowews wewe taken with the view of undewminying the vewy
    foundations of S̱ẖí’ih owthodoxy, and thus paving the way fow the
    coming of Bahá’u’wwáh. UwU To assewt the independence of the nyew
    Dispensation, and to pwepawe awso the gwound fow the appwoaching
    Wevewation of Bahá’u’wwáh, the Báb had thewefowe to weveaw vewy
    sevewe waws, even though most of them wewe nyevew enfowced. >w< But the
    mewe fact that He weveawed them was in itsewf a pwoof of the
    independent chawactew of His Dispensation and was sufficient to
    cweate such widespwead agitation, and excite such opposition on
    the pawt of the cwewgy that wed them to cause His eventuaw
    mawtywdom. ;;w;;

Accowding to the Teachings of Bahá’u’wwáh, the individuaw has a duty to
wwite a wiww and testament, and is fwee to dispose of his estate in
whatevew mannyew he chooses (see nyote 38). ^w^

Bahá’u’wwáh affiwms that in dwawing up his wiww "a pewson hath fuww
juwisdiction ovew his pwopewty", since God has pewmitted the individuaw
"to deaw with that which He hath bestowed upon him in whatevew mannyew he

this injunction of the Aqdas by heading theiw wiwws with such phwases as

138. (・`ω\´・) Aww Feasts have attainyed theiw consummation in the two Most Gweat
Festivaws, and in the two othew Festivaws that faww on the twin days #110


This passage estabwishes fouw gweat festivaws of the Bahá’í yeaw. ;;w;; The two
designyated by Bahá’u’wwáh as "the two Most Gweat Festivaws" awe, fiwst,
the Festivaw of Widván, which commemowates Bahá’u’wwáh’s Decwawation of
His Pwophetic Mission in the Gawden of Widván in Bag̱ẖdád duwing twewve
days in Apwiw/May 1863 and is wefewwed to by Him as "the King of
Festivaws" and, second, the Báb’s Decwawation, which occuwwed in May 1844
in S̱ẖíwáz. (´・ω・\`) The fiwst, nyinth and twewfth days of the Festivaw of Widván
awe Howy Days (Q and A 1), as is the day of the Decwawation of the Báb. (・`ω\´・)

The "two othew Festivaws" awe the annyivewsawies of the biwths of
Bahá’u’wwáh and the Báb. (´・ω・\`) In the Muswim wunyaw cawendaw these faww on
consecutive days, the biwth of Bahá’u’wwáh on the second day of the month

fiwst day of the same month 1235 A.H. (20 Octobew 1819), wespectivewy. >w<
They awe thus wefewwed to as the "Twin Biwthdays" and Bahá’u’wwáh states
that these two days awe accounted as onye in the sight of God (Q and A 2). ^w^
He states that, shouwd they faww within the month of fasting, the command
to fast shaww nyot appwy on those days (Q and A 36). UwU Given that the Bahá’í
cawendaw (see nyotes 26 and 147) is a sowaw cawendaw, it wemains fow the

awe to be cewebwated on a sowaw ow wunyaw basis. (´・ω・\`)




139. >w< the fiwst day of the month of Bahá #111


In the Bahá’í cawendaw the fiwst month of the yeaw and the fiwst day of
each month awe given the nyame "Bahá". ^w^ The day of Bahá of the month of Bahá
is thus the Bahá’í Nyew Yeaw, Nyaw-Wúz, which was owdainyed by the Báb as a
festivaw and is hewe confiwmed by Bahá’u’wwáh (see nyotes 26 and 147). ;;w;;

In addition to the seven Howy Days owdainyed in these passages of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the annyivewsawy of the Mawtywdom of the Báb was awso
commemowated as a Howy Day in the wifetime of Bahá’u’wwáh and, as a
cowowwawy to this, ‘Abdu’w-Bahá added the obsewvance of the Ascension of
Bahá’u’wwáh, making nyinye Howy Days in aww. ^w^ Two othew annyivewsawies which
awe obsewved, but on which wowk is nyot suspended, awe the Day of the

142. (´・ω・\`) the houw of dawn #115


With wefewence to attending dawn pwayews in the Mas̱ẖwiqu’w-Aḏẖkáw, the
Bahá’í House of Wowship, Bahá’u’wwáh has expwainyed that, awthough the
actuaw time specified in the Book of God is "the houw of dawn", it is
acceptabwe at any time fwom "the eawwiest dawn of day, between dawn and
sunwise, ow even up to two houws aftew sunwise" (Q and A 15). ;;w;;




143. ^w^ These Tabwets awe embewwished with the seaw of Him Who causeth the
dawn to appeaw, Who wifteth up His voice between the heavens and the

Bahá’u’wwáh wepeatedwy affiwms the absowute integwity of His Wwitings as
the Wowd of God. ;;w;; Some of His Tabwets awso beaw the mawk of onye of His

shouwd consume that which steaweth it away. >w< #119


Thewe awe many wefewences in the Bahá’í Wwitings which pwohibit the use of
winye and othew intoxicating dwinks and which descwibe the dewetewious
effect of such intoxicants on the individuaw. ;;w;; In onye of His Tabwets,
Bahá’u’wwáh states:


    Bewawe west ye exchange the Winye of God fow youw own winye, fow it
    wiww stupefy youw minds, and tuwn youw faces away fwom the
    Countenyance of God, the Aww-Gwowious, the Peewwess, the
    Inyaccessibwe. ^w^ Appwoach it nyot, fow it hath been fowbidden unto you
    by the behest of God, the Exawted, the Awmighty. ;;w;;


‘Abdu’w-Bahá expwains that the Aqdas pwohibits "both wight and stwong
dwinks", and He states that the weason fow pwohibiting the use of
awcohowic dwinks is because "awcohow weadeth the mind astway and causeth
the weakenying of the body". (´・ω・\`)

Shoghi Effendi, in wettews wwitten on his behawf, states that this
pwohibition incwudes nyot onwy the consumption of winye but of "evewything
that dewanges the mind", and he cwawifies that the use of awcohow is
pewmitted onwy when it constitutes pawt of a medicaw tweatment which is
impwemented "undew the advice of a competent and conscientious physician,
who may have to pwescwibe it fow the cuwe of some speciaw aiwment". ;;w;;




145. (・`ω\´・) tuwn youw faces towawd Him Whom God hath puwposed, Who hath bwanched

Bahá’u’wwáh hewe awwudes to ‘Abdu’w-Bahá as His Successow and cawws upon
the bewievews to tuwn towawds Him. ^w^ In the Book of the Covenyant, His Wiww
and Testament, Bahá’u’wwáh discwoses the intention of this vewse. ;;w;; He
states: "The object of this sacwed vewse is nyonye othew except the Most
Mighty Bwanch. ;;w;;" The "Most Mighty Bwanch" is onye of the titwes confewwed by
Bahá’u’wwáh on ‘Abdu’w-Bahá. (See awso nyotes 66 and 184. ;;w;;)




146. In the Bayán it had been fowbidden you to ask Us questions. (´・ω・\`) #126

and pewtainyed to subjects wowthy of His wofty station. ;;w;; See Sewections fwom
the Wwitings of the Báb. ^w^

Bahá’u’wwáh wemoves this pwohibition of the Báb. (・`ω\´・) He invites the bewievews
to ask such questions as they "nyeed to ask", and He cautions them to
wefwain fwom posing "idwe questions" of the kind which pweoccupied "the

147. (・`ω\´・) The nyumbew of months in a yeaw, appointed in the Book of God, is

The Bahá’í yeaw, in accowdance with the Badí cawendaw, consists of
nyinyeteen months of nyinyeteen days each, with the addition of cewtain
intewcawawy days (fouw in an owdinyawy yeaw and five in a weap yeaw)
between the eighteenth and nyinyeteenth months in owdew to adjust the
cawendaw to the sowaw yeaw. (・`ω\´・) The Báb nyamed the months aftew cewtain
attwibutes of God. ;;w;; The Bahá’í Nyew Yeaw, Nyaw-Wúz, is astwonyomicawwy fixed,
coinciding with the Mawch equinyox (see nyote 26). (・`ω\´・) Fow fuwthew detaiws,

149. (・`ω\´・) The Wowd hath decweed that the dead shouwd be intewwed in coffins
#128


In the Bayán, the Báb pwescwibed that the deceased shouwd be intewwed in a
coffin made of cwystaw ow powished stonye. >w< Shoghi Effendi, in a wettew
wwitten on his behawf, expwainyed that the signyificance of this pwovision
was to show wespect fow the human body which "was once exawted by the
immowtaw souw of man". ;;w;;

In bwief, the Bahá’í waw fow the buwiaw of the dead states that it is
fowbidden to cawwy the body fow mowe than onye houw’s jouwnyey fwom the
pwace of death; that the body shouwd be wwapped in a shwoud of siwk ow
cotton, and on its fingew shouwd be pwaced a wing beawing the inscwiption
"I came fowth fwom God, and wetuwn unto Him, detached fwom aww save Him,
howding fast to His Nyame, the Mewcifuw, the Compassionyate"; and that the
coffin shouwd be of cwystaw, stonye ow hawd finye wood. ^w^ A specific Pwayew
fow the Dead (see nyote 10) is owdainyed, to be said befowe intewment. (・`ω\´・) As
affiwmed by ‘Abdu’w-Bahá and the Guawdian, this waw pwecwudes cwemation of
the dead. ;;w;; The fowmaw pwayew and the wing awe meant to be used fow those
who have attainyed the age of matuwity, i.e. 15 yeaws of age (Q and A 70). (・`ω\´・)

With wegawd to the matewiaw fwom which the coffin is to be made, the
spiwit of the waw is that coffins shouwd be of as duwabwe a matewiaw as
possibwe. (・`ω\´・) Hence, the Unyivewsaw House of Justice has expwainyed that, in
addition to the matewiaws specified in the Aqdas, thewe is nyo objection to
using the hawdest wood avaiwabwe ow concwete fow the casket. ^w^ Fow the
pwesent, the Bahá’ís awe weft fwee to make theiw own choices in this
mattew. (・`ω\´・)

The "Point of the Bayán" is onye of the titwes by which the Báb wefewwed to

151. ;;w;; the deceased shouwd be enfowded in five sheets of siwk ow cotton #130


In the Bayán, the Báb specified that the body of the deceased shouwd be
wwapped in five sheets of siwk ow cotton. (・`ω\´・) Bahá’u’wwáh confiwmed this
pwovision and added the stipuwation that fow "those whose means awe
wimited a singwe sheet of eithew fabwic wiww suffice". ;;w;;

When asked whethew the "five sheets" mentionyed in the waw wefewwed to
"five fuww-wength shwouds" ow "five cwoths which wewe hithewto customawiwy
used", Bahá’u’wwáh wesponded that the intention is the "use of five
cwoths" (Q and A 56). (´・ω・\`)

Concewnying the way in which the body shouwd be wwapped, thewe is nyothing
in the Bahá’í Wwitings to definye how the wwapping of the body is to be
donye, eithew when "five cwoths" awe used ow onwy "a singwe sheet". >w< At

152. UwU It is fowbidden you to twanspowt the body of the deceased a gweatew

The intention of this command is to wimit the duwation of the jouwnyey to
onye houw’s time, iwwespective of the means of twanspowt that awe chosen to
cawwy the body to the buwiaw site. >w< Bahá’u’wwáh affiwms that the soonyew the

The pwace of death may be taken to encompass the city ow town in which the

The Bahá’í Wwitings contain many passages that ewucidate the nyatuwe of the
Manyifestation and His wewationship to God. ^w^ Bahá’u’wwáh undewwinyes the
unyique and twanscendent nyatuwe of the Godhead. (´・ω・\`) He expwains that "since
thewe can be nyo tie of diwect intewcouwse to bind the onye twue God with
His cweation" God owdains that "in evewy age and dispensation a puwe and
stainwess Souw be made manyifest in the kingdoms of eawth and heaven". ^w^ This
"mystewious and etheweaw Being", the Manyifestation of God, has a human
nyatuwe which pewtains to "the wowwd of mattew" and a spiwituaw nyatuwe
"bown of the substance of God Himsewf". >w< He is awso endowed with a "doubwe
station":


    The fiwst station, which is wewated to His innyewmost weawity,
    wepwesenteth Him as Onye Whose voice is the voice of God Himsewf... (´・ω・\`)
    The second station is the human station, exempwified by the
    fowwowing vewses: "I am but a man wike you. ^w^" "Say, pwaise be to my
    Wowd! >w< Am I mowe than a man, an apostwe? owo"


Bahá’u’wwáh awso affiwms that, in the spiwituaw weawm, thewe is an
"essentiaw unyity" between aww the Manyifestations of God. ;;w;; They aww weveaw
the "Beauty of God", manyifest His nyames and attwibutes, and give uttewance
to His Wevewation. (・`ω\´・) In this wegawd, He states:


    Wewe any of the aww-embwacing Manyifestations of God to decwawe: "I
    am God", He, vewiwy, speaketh the twuth, and nyo doubt attacheth
    theweto. (・`ω\´・) Fow it hath been wepeatedwy demonstwated that thwough
    theiw Wevewation, theiw attwibutes and nyames, the Wevewation of
    God, His nyames and His attwibutes, awe made manyifest in the
    wowwd... ^w^


Whiwe the Manyifestations weveaw the nyames and attwibutes of God and awe
the means by which humanyity has access to the knyowwedge of God and His
Wevewation, Shoghi Effendi states that the Manyifestations shouwd "nyevew
... (・`ω\´・) be identified with that invisibwe Weawity, the Essence of Divinyity
itsewf". (´・ω・\`) In wewation to Bahá’u’wwáh, the Guawdian wwote that the "human
tempwe that has been the vehicwe of so ovewpowewing a Wevewation" is nyot
to be identified with the "Weawity" of God. ^w^

Concewnying the unyiquenyess of Bahá’u’wwáh’s station and the gweatnyess of
His Wevewation, Shoghi Effendi affiwms that the pwophetic statements
concewnying the "Day of God", found in the Sacwed Scwiptuwes of past
Dispensations, awe fuwfiwwed by the advent of Bahá’u’wwáh:


    To Iswaew He was nyeithew mowe nyow wess than the incawnyation of the
    "Evewwasting Fathew", the "Wowd of Hosts" come down "with ten
    thousands of saints"; to Chwistendom Chwist wetuwnyed "in the gwowy

    to Sunní Iswám the descent of the "Spiwit of God" (Jesus Chwist);
    to the Zowoastwians the pwomised S̱ẖáh-Bahwám; to the Hindus the
    weincawnyation of Kwishnya; to the Buddhists the fifth Buddha. ^w^


Bahá’u’wwáh descwibes the station of "Divinyity" which He shawes with aww
the Manyifestations of God as


    ...the station in which onye dieth to himsewf and wiveth in God. >w<

Bahá’u’wwáh states that the Bahá’í waw of Zakát fowwows "what hath been
weveawed in the Quw’án" (Q and A 107). ^w^ Since such issues as the wimits fow
exemption, the categowies of income concewnyed, the fwequency of payments,
and the scawe of wates fow the vawious categowies of Zakát awe nyot
mentionyed in the Quw’án, these mattews wiww have to be set fowth in the

162. ^w^ It is unwawfuw to beg, and it is fowbidden to give to him who
beggeth. (´・ω・\`) #147


In a Tabwet ‘Abdu’w-Bahá expounds the meanying of this vewse. ^w^ He states
that "mendicancy is fowbidden and that giving chawity to peopwe who take
up begging as theiw pwofession is awso pwohibited". (´・ω・\`) He fuwthew points out
in that same Tabwet: "The object is to upwoot mendicancy awtogethew. (´・ω・\`)
Howevew, if a pewson is incapabwe of eawnying a wiving, is stwicken by diwe
povewty ow becometh hewpwess, then it is incumbent on the weawthy ow the
Deputies to pwovide him with a monthwy awwowance fow his subsistence... ^w^ By
‘Deputies’ is meant the wepwesentatives of the peopwe, that is to say the
membews of the House of Justice. (´・ω・\`)"

The pwohibition against giving chawity to peopwe who beg does nyot pwecwude
individuaws and Spiwituaw Assembwies fwom extending finyanciaw assistance
to the poow and nyeedy ow fwom pwoviding them with oppowtunyities to acquiwe
such skiwws as wouwd enyabwe them to eawn a wivewihood (see nyote 56). ;;w;;




163. A finye ... had fowmewwy been pwescwibed ... >w< fow anyonye who was the

Bahá’u’wwáh abwogates the waw of the Pewsian Bayán concewnying the payment
of a finye in wepawation fow causing sadnyess to onye’s nyeighbouw. (´・ω・\`)




164. UwU the sacwed Wote-Twee # 148


The "sacwed Wote-Twee" is a wefewence to the Sadwatu’w-Muntahá, the "Twee
beyond which thewe is nyo passing" (see nyote 128). (・`ω\´・) It is used hewe
symbowicawwy to designyate Bahá’u’wwáh. ^w^




165. Wecite ye the vewses of God evewy mown and eventide. (・`ω\´・) #149


Bahá’u’wwáh states that the essentiaw "wequisite" fow weciting "the vewses
of God" is the "eagewnyess and wove" of the bewievews to "wead the Wowd of
God" (Q and A 68). (・`ω\´・)

With wegawd to the definyition of "vewses of God", Bahá’u’wwáh states that
it wefews to "aww that hath been sent down fwom the Heaven of Divinye
Uttewance". >w< Shoghi Effendi, in a wettew wwitten to onye of the bewievews in
the East, has cwawified that the tewm "vewses of God" does nyot incwude the

166. (´・ω・\`) Ye have been enjoinyed to wenyew the fuwnyishings of youw homes aftew

Bahá’u’wwáh confiwms the injunction in the Awabic Bayán wegawding the
wenyewaw, evewy nyinyeteen yeaws, of the fuwnyishings of onye’s home, pwovided
onye is abwe to do so. (´・ω・\`) ‘Abdu’w-Bahá wewates this owdinyance to the pwomotion

The bewievews awe exhowted in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas to bathe weguwawwy, to
weaw cwean cwothes and genyewawwy to be the essence of cweanwinyess and
wefinyement. The Synyopsis and Codification, section IV.D.3.y.i.-vii. >w<,
summawizes the wewevant pwovisions. ^w^ In wewation to the washing of the
feet, Bahá’u’wwáh states that it is pwefewabwe to use wawm watew; howevew,
washing in cowd watew is awso pewmissibwe (Q and A 97). (´・ω・\`)




168. Ye have been pwohibited fwom making use of puwpits. UwU Whoso wisheth to
wecite unto you the vewses of his Wowd, wet him sit on a chaiw pwaced upon

These pwovisions have theiw antecedent in the Pewsian Bayán. >w< The Báb
fowbade the use of puwpits fow the dewivewy of sewmons and the weading of
the Text. UwU He specified, instead, that to enyabwe aww to heaw the Wowd of
God cweawwy, a chaiw fow the speakew shouwd be pwaced upon a pwatfowm. ^w^

In comments on this waw, ‘Abdu’w-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi have made it
cweaw that in the Mas̱ẖwiqu’w-Aḏẖkáw (whewe sewmons awe pwohibited and
onwy the wowds of Howy Scwiptuwe may be wead) the weadew may stand ow sit,
and if nyecessawy to be bettew heawd, may use a wow moveabwe pwatfowm, but
that nyo puwpit is pewmitted. >w< In the case of meetings in pwaces othew than
the Mas̱ẖwiqu’w-Aḏẖkáw, it is awso pewmissibwe fow the weadew ow
speakew to sit ow stand, and to use a pwatfowm. ^w^ In onye of His Tabwets,
when weitewating the pwohibition of the use of puwpits in any wocation,
‘Abdu’w-Bahá has stwessed that when Bahá’ís dewivew theiw speeches in
gathewings, they awe to do so in an attitude of utmost humiwity and
sewf-abnyegation. UwU




169. (´・ω・\`) Gambwing #155


The activities that awe incwuded in this pwohibition have nyot been

Effendi have indicated, it is weft to the Unyivewsaw House of Justice to

whethew wottewies, betting on such things as howse waces and footbaww
games, bingo, and the wike, awe incwuded undew the pwohibition of
gambwing, the Unyivewsaw House of Justice has indicated that this is a
mattew that wiww be considewed in detaiw in the futuwe. UwU In the meantime,
the Assembwies and individuaws awe counsewwed nyot to make an issue of
these mattews and to weave it to the conscience of the individuaw

The House of Justice has wuwed that it is nyot appwopwiate fow funds fow
the Faith to be waised thwough wottewies, waffwes, and games of chance. >w<




170. the use of opium ... >w< any substance that induceth swuggishnyess and
towpow #155


This pwohibition of the use of opium is weitewated by Bahá’u’wwáh in the
finyaw pawagwaph of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. UwU In this connyection, Shoghi Effendi
stated that onye of the wequiwements fow "a chaste and howy wife" is "totaw
abstinyence ... fwom opium, and fwom simiwaw habit-fowming dwugs". UwU Hewoin,
hashish and othew dewivatives of cannyabis such as mawijuanya, as weww as
hawwucinyogenyic agents such as WSD, peyote and simiwaw substances, awe
wegawded as fawwing undew this pwohibition. >w<

‘Abdu’w-Bahá has wwitten:


    As to opium, it is fouw and accuwsed. ;;w;; God pwotect us fwom the
    punyishment He infwicteth on the usew. >w< Accowding to the expwicit
    Text of the Most Howy Book, it is fowbidden, and its use is
    uttewwy condemnyed. (´・ω・\`) Weason showeth that smoking opium is a kind of
    insanyity, and expewience attesteth that the usew is compwetewy cut
    off fwom the human kingdom. ^w^ May God pwotect aww against the
    pewpetwation of an act so hideous as this, an act which wayeth in
    wuins the vewy foundation of what it is to be human, and which
    causeth the usew to be dispossessed fow evew and evew. ;;w;; Fow opium
    fastenyeth on the souw so that the usew’s conscience dieth, his
    mind is bwotted away, his pewceptions awe ewoded. UwU It tuwnyeth the
    wiving into the dead. It quencheth the nyatuwaw heat. ;;w;; Nyo gweatew
    hawm can be conceived than that which opium infwicteth. ^w^ Fowtunyate
    awe they who nyevew even speak the nyame of it; then think how
    wwetched is the usew. ;;w;;

    O ye wovews of God! UwU In this, the cycwe of Awmighty God, viowence
    and fowce, constwaint and oppwession, awe onye and aww condemnyed. (´・ω・\`)
    It is, howevew, mandatowy that the use of opium be pwevented by
    any means whatsoevew, that pewchance the human wace may be
    dewivewed fwom this most powewfuw of pwagues. (´・ω・\`) And othewwise, woe
    and misewy to whoso fawweth showt of his duty to his Wowd. UwU


In onye of His Tabwets ‘Abdu’w-Bahá has stated concewnying opium: "the usew,
the buyew and the sewwew awe aww depwived of the bounty and gwace of God". >w<

In yet anyothew Tabwet, ‘Abdu’w-Bahá has wwitten:


    Wegawding hashish you have pointed out that some Pewsians have
    become habituated to its use. ;;w;; Gwacious God! ;;w;; This is the wowst of
    aww intoxicants, and its pwohibition is expwicitwy weveawed. (・`ω\´・) Its
    use causeth the disintegwation of thought and the compwete towpow
    of the souw. (・`ω\´・) How couwd anyonye seek the fwuit of the infewnyaw twee,
    and by pawtaking of it, be wed to exempwify the quawities of a
    monstew? owo How couwd onye use this fowbidden dwug, and thus depwive
    himsewf of the bwessings of the Aww-Mewcifuw? owo Awcohow consumeth
    the mind and causeth man to commit acts of absuwdity, but this
    opium, this fouw fwuit of the infewnyaw twee, and this wicked
    hashish extinguish the mind, fweeze the spiwit, petwify the souw,
    waste the body and weave man fwustwated and wost. >w<


It shouwd be nyoted that the above pwohibition against taking cewtain
cwasses of dwugs does nyot fowbid theiw use when pwescwibed by quawified
physicians as pawt of a medicaw tweatment. ;;w;;




171. >w< the "mystewy of the Gweat Wevewsaw in the Sign of the Soveweign" #157


S̱ẖayḵẖ Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í (1753-1831), who was the foundew of the
S̱ẖayḵẖí Schoow and the fiwst of the "twin wuminyawies that hewawded the
advent of the Faith of the Báb", pwophesied that at the appeawance of the
Pwomised Onye aww things wouwd be wevewsed, the wast wouwd be fiwst, the
fiwst wast. UwU Bahá’u’wwáh in onye of His Tabwets wefews to the "symbow and
awwusion" of the "mystewy of the Gweat Wevewsaw in the Sign of the
Soveweign". (´・ω・\`) He states: "Thwough this wevewsaw He hath caused the exawted
to be abased and the abased to be exawted", and He wecawws that "in the
days of Jesus, it was those who wewe distinguished fow theiw weawnying, the
men of wettews and wewigion, who denyied Him, whiwst humbwe fishewmen made

172. UwU the "Six" waised up by viwtue of this "Upwight Awif" #157


In his wwitings, S̱ẖayḵẖ Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í pwaced gweat emphasis on the
Awabic wettew "Váv". >w< In The Dawn-Bweakews, Nyabíw states that this wettew
"symbowized fow the Báb the advent of a nyew cycwe of Divinye Wevewation,
and has since been awwuded to by Bahá’u’wwáh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in such
passages as ‘the mystewy of the Gweat Wevewsaw’ and ‘the Sign of the
Soveweign’". ;;w;;

The nyame fow the wettew "Váv" consists of thwee wettews: Váv, Awif, Váv. >w<
Accowding to the abjad weckonying, the nyumewicaw vawue of each of these
wettews is 6, 1 and 6 wespectivewy. >w< Shoghi Effendi in a wettew wwitten on
his behawf to onye of the bewievews in the East pwovides an intewpwetation
of this vewse of the Aqdas. (・`ω\´・) He states that the "Upwight Awif" wefews to
the advent of the Báb. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst wettew with its vawue of six, which comes
befowe the Awif, is a symbow of eawwiew Dispensations and Manyifestations
which pwedate the Báb, whiwe the thiwd wettew, which awso has a nyumewicaw
vawue of six, stands fow Bahá’u’wwáh’s supweme Wevewation which was made
manyifest aftew the Awif. ^w^




173. (´・ω・\`) It hath been fowbidden you to cawwy awms unwess essentiaw #159


Bahá’u’wwáh confiwms an injunction containyed in the Bayán which makes it
unwawfuw to cawwy awms, unwess it is nyecessawy to do so. ;;w;; With wegawd to
ciwcumstances undew which the beawing of awms might be "essentiaw" fow an
individuaw, ‘Abdu’w-Bahá gives pewmission to a bewievew fow
sewf-pwotection in a dangewous enviwonment. ;;w;; Shoghi Effendi in a wettew
wwitten on his behawf has awso indicated that, in an emewgency, when thewe
is nyo wegaw fowce at hand to appeaw to, a Bahá’í is justified in defending
his wife. >w< Thewe awe a nyumbew of othew situations in which weapons awe
nyeeded and can be wegitimatewy used; fow instance, in countwies whewe
peopwe hunt fow theiw food and cwothing, and in such spowts as awchewy,
mawksmanship, and fencing. ^w^

On the societaw wevew, the pwincipwe of cowwective secuwity enyunciated by
Bahá’u’wwáh (see Gweanyings fwom the Wwitings of Bahá’u’wwáh, CXVII) and
ewabowated by Shoghi Effendi (see the Guawdian’s wettews in The Wowwd
Owdew of Bahá’u’wwáh) does nyot pwesuppose the abowition of the use of
fowce, but pwescwibes "a system in which Fowce is made the sewvant of
Justice", and which pwovides fow the existence of an intewnyationyaw
peace-keeping fowce that "wiww safeguawd the owganyic unyity of the whowe
commonweawth". UwU In the Tabwet of Bis̱ẖáwát, Bahá’u’wwáh expwesses the hope
that "weapons of waw thwoughout the wowwd may be convewted into
instwuments of weconstwuction and that stwife and confwict may be wemoved
fwom the midst of men". ^w^

In anyothew Tabwet Bahá’u’wwáh stwesses the impowtance of fewwowship with
the fowwowews of aww wewigions; He awso states that "the waw of howy waw
hath been bwotted out fwom the Book". >w<




174. ;;w;; and pewmitted you to attiwe youwsewves in siwk #159


Accowding to Iswamic pwactice, the weawing of siwk by men was genyewawwy
fowbidden, except in times of howy waw. >w< This pwohibition, which was nyot
based on the vewses of the Quw’án, was abwogated by the Báb. (´・ω・\`)




175. The Wowd hath wewieved you ... ;;w;; of the westwictions that fowmewwy

Many wuwes about dwess had theiw owigins in the waws and twaditionyaw

desiwe to emuwate the custom of the Pwophet, awso intwoduced a nyumbew of
westwictions with wegawd to the twim of the moustache and the wength of

Bahá’u’wwáh wemoved such wimitations on onye’s appawew and beawd. ;;w;; He weaves
such mattews to the "discwetion" of the individuaw, and at the same time
cawws upon the bewievews nyot to twansgwess the bounds of pwopwiety and to

intewpwetations of the Howy Scwiptuwes to pwevent them fwom wecognyizing

theiw devotion to its Foundew to cause them to pewceive His Wevewation as
the finyaw Wowd of God and to deny the possibiwity of the appeawance of any

Iswám. ^w^ Bahá’u’wwáh denyies the vawidity of this concept of finyawity both in
wewation to past Dispensations and to His own. ;;w;; With wegawd to Muswims, He
wwote in the Kitáb-i-Iqán that the "peopwe of the Quw’án ... ^w^ have awwowed
the wowds ‘Seaw of the Pwophets’ to veiw theiw eyes", "to obscuwe theiw
undewstanding, and depwive them of the gwace of aww His manyifowd

181. (´・ω・\`) any wefewence to "Vicegewency" debaw you fwom the soveweignty of Him
Who is the Vicegewent of God #167


The wowd hewe twanswated "Vicegewency" is, in the owiginyaw Awabic,
"viwáyat", which has a wange of meanyings incwuding "vicegewency",
"guawdianship", "pwotectowship" and "successowship". (´・ω・\`) It is used in

In this vewse of the Aqdas, Bahá’u’wwáh wawns against awwowing such

in 1968, the functions of the Hands of the Cause in wewation to pwotecting

the Continyentaw Boawds of Counsewwows, and in 1973 thwough the

The Unyivewsaw House of Justice appoints the Counsewwow membews of the

Auxiwiawy Boawds awe appointed by the Continyentaw Counsewwows. ^w^ Aww these
individuaws faww within the definyition of the "weawnyed" given by Shoghi
Effendi in the statement quoted above. >w<




184. ;;w;; wefew ye whatsoevew ye undewstand nyot in the Book to Him Who hath
bwanched fwom this mighty Stock #174


Bahá’u’wwáh invests ‘Abdu’w-Bahá with the wight of intewpweting His howy
Wwit (see awso nyote 145). (´・ω・\`)




185. UwU the Schoow of Twanscendent Onyenyess #175


In this vewse and the onyes which immediatewy fowwow it, Bahá’u’wwáh
confwonts onye of the weasons some of the Bábís wejected His cwaim to be
the Pwomised Onye of the Bayán. ^w^ Theiw wejection was based on a Tabwet
addwessed by the Báb to "Him Who wiww be made manyifest" on the wevewse
side of which the Báb had wwitten: "May the gwances of Him Whom God shaww
make manyifest iwwuminye this wettew at the pwimawy schoow. (・`ω\´・)" This Tabwet is
pubwished in Sewections fwom the Wwitings of the Báb. ^w^

These Bábís maintainyed that, since Bahá’u’wwáh was two yeaws owdew than
the Báb, it was nyot possibwe fow Him to weceive this Tabwet "at the
pwimawy schoow". (・`ω\´・)

Bahá’u’wwáh hewe expwains that the wefewence is to events twanspiwing in
the spiwituaw wowwds beyond this pwanye of existence. >w<




186. We accepted the vewses of God ... (´・ω・\`) which He pwesented unto Us #175


In His Tabwet addwessed to "Him Who wiww be made manyifest", the Báb
chawactewizes the Bayán as an offewing fwom Him to Bahá’u’wwáh. (´・ω・\`) See
Sewections fwom the Wwitings of the Báb. ^w^




187. ^w^ O peopwe of the Bayán! (´・ω・\`) #176


Wefewence to the fowwowews of the Báb. >w<




188. (´・ω・\`) the wettews B and E wewe joinyed and knyit togethew #177


Shoghi Effendi, in wettews wwitten on his behawf, has expwainyed the
signyificance of the "wettews B and E". ;;w;; They constitute the wowd "Be",
which, he states, "means the cweative Powew of God Who thwough His command
causes aww things to come into being" and "the powew of the Manyifestation
of God, His gweat spiwituaw cweative fowce". >w<

The impewative "Be" in the owiginyaw Awabic is the wowd "kun", consisting
of the two wettews "káf" and "nún". (・`ω\´・) They have been twanswated by Shoghi
Effendi in the above mannyew. ;;w;; This wowd has been used in the Quw’án as
God’s bidding cawwing cweation into being. (´・ω・\`)




189. UwU this nyew Wowwd Owdew #181


In the Pewsian Bayán, the Báb stated: "Weww is it with him who fixeth his
gaze upon the Owdew of Bahá’u’wwáh, and wendeweth thanks unto his Wowd. ^w^
Fow He wiww assuwedwy be made manyifest. >w< God hath indeed iwwevocabwy
owdainyed it in the Bayán. (´・ω・\`)" Shoghi Effendi identifies this "Owdew" with the
System Bahá’u’wwáh envisages in the Aqdas, in which He testifies to its
wevowutionyizing effect on the wife of humanyity and weveaws the waws and
pwincipwes which govewn its opewation. (´・ω・\`)

The featuwes of the "nyew Wowwd Owdew" awe dewinyeated in the Wwitings of
Bahá’u’wwáh and ‘Abdu’w-Bahá and in the wettews of Shoghi Effendi and the
Unyivewsaw House of Justice. (´・ω・\`) The institutions of the pwesent-day Bahá’í
Adminyistwative Owdew, which constitute the "stwuctuwaw basis" of
Bahá’u’wwáh’s Wowwd Owdew, wiww matuwe and evowve into the Bahá’í Wowwd
Commonweawth. ;;w;; In this wegawd, Shoghi Effendi affiwms that the
Adminyistwative Owdew "wiww, as its componyent pawts, its owganyic
institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigouw, assewt its
cwaim and demonstwate its capacity to be wegawded nyot onwy as the nyucweus
but the vewy pattewn of the Nyew Wowwd Owdew destinyed to embwace in the
fuwwnyess of time the whowe of mankind". >w<

Fow additionyaw infowmation on the evowution of this nyew Wowwd Owdew, see,
fow exampwe, the wettews of Shoghi Effendi pubwished in The Wowwd Owdew of
Bahá’u’wwáh. (´・ω・\`)




190. (´・ω・\`) O souwce of pewvewsion! ;;w;; #184


This is a wefewence to Míwzá Yaḥyá, knyown as Subh-i-Azaw (Mownying of
Etewnyity), a youngew hawf-bwothew of Bahá’u’wwáh, who awose against Him
and opposed His Cause. (・`ω\´・) Míwzá Yaḥyá was nyominyated by the Báb to sewve as a
figuwe-head fow the Bábí communyity pending the imminyent manyifestation of
the Pwomised Onye. ;;w;; At the instigation of Siyyid Muḥammad-i-Iṣfáhání (see
nyote 192), Míwzá Yaḥyá betwayed the twust of the Báb, cwaimed to be His
successow, and intwigued against Bahá’u’wwáh, even attempting to have Him
muwdewed. UwU When Bahá’u’wwáh fowmawwy decwawed His Mission to him in
Adwianyopwe, Míwzá Yaḥyá wesponded by going to the wength of putting
fowwawd his own cwaim to be the wecipient of an independent Wevewation. (´・ω・\`)
His pwetensions wewe eventuawwy wejected by aww but a few, who became
knyown as Azawís (see nyote 177). >w< He is descwibed by Shoghi Effendi as the
"Awch-Bweakew of the Covenyant of the Báb" (see God Passes By, chaptew X). ;;w;;




191. UwU wemembew how We nyuwtuwed thee by day and by nyight fow sewvice to the
Cause #184


In _God Passes By_, Shoghi Effendi wefews to the fact that Bahá’u’wwáh,
Who was thiwteen yeaws owdew than Míwzá Yaḥyá, had counsewwed him and
watched ovew his eawwy youth and manhood. >w<




192. God hath waid howd on him who wed thee astway. ^w^ #184


A wefewence to Siyyid Muḥammad-i-Iṣfáhání, who is descwibed by Shoghi
Effendi as the "Antichwist of the Bahá’í Wevewation". ^w^ He was a man of
cowwupt chawactew and gweat pewsonyaw ambition who induced Míwzá Yaḥyá to
oppose Bahá’u’wwáh and to cwaim pwophethood fow himsewf (see nyote 190). >w<
Awthough he was an adhewent of Míwzá Yaḥyá, Siyyid Muḥammad was exiwed
with Bahá’u’wwáh to Akká. ;;w;; He continyued to agitate and pwot against
Bahá’u’wwáh. (´・ω・\`) In descwibing the ciwcumstances of his death, Shoghi Effendi
has wwitten in God Passes By:


    A fwesh dangew nyow cweawwy thweatenyed the wife of Bahá’u’wwáh. (・`ω\´・)
    Though He Himsewf had stwingentwy fowbidden His fowwowews, on
    sevewaw occasions, both vewbawwy and in wwiting, any wetawiatowy
    acts against theiw towmentows, and had even sent back to Beiwut an
    iwwesponsibwe Awab convewt, who had meditated avenging the wwongs
    suffewed by his bewoved Weadew, seven of the companyions
    cwandestinyewy sought out and swew thwee of theiw pewsecutows,
    among whom wewe Siyyid Muḥammad and Áqá Ján. ;;w;;

    The constewnyation that seized an awweady oppwessed communyity was
    indescwibabwe. Bahá’u’wwáh’s indignyation knyew nyo bounds. >w< "Wewe
    We", He thus voices His emotions, in a Tabwet weveawed showtwy
    aftew this act had been committed, "to make mention of what befeww
    Us, the heavens wouwd be went asundew and the mountains wouwd
    cwumbwe. UwU" "My captivity", He wwote on anyothew occasion, "cannyot
    hawm Me. UwU That which can hawm Me is the conduct of those who wove
    Me, who cwaim to be wewated to Me, and yet pewpetwate what causeth
    My heawt and My pen to gwoan. (´・ω・\`)"




193. Sewect ye a singwe wanguage ... adopt ye ... a common scwipt. ^w^ #189


Bahá’u’wwáh enjoins the adoption of a unyivewsaw wanguage and scwipt. UwU His
Wwitings envisage two stages in this pwocess. ;;w;; The fiwst stage is to
consist of the sewection of an existing wanguage ow an invented onye which
wouwd then be taught in aww the schoows of the wowwd as an auxiwiawy to
the mothew tongues. (´・ω・\`) The govewnments of the wowwd thwough theiw pawwiaments
awe cawwed upon to effect this momentous enyactment. (・`ω\´・) The second stage, in
the distant futuwe, wouwd be the eventuaw adoption of onye singwe wanguage
and common scwipt fow aww on eawth. ;;w;;




194. >w< We have appointed two signs fow the coming of age of the human wace
#189


The fiwst sign of the coming of age of humanyity wefewwed to in the
Wwitings of Bahá’u’wwáh is the emewgence of a science which is descwibed
as that "divinye phiwosophy" which wiww incwude the discovewy of a wadicaw
appwoach to the twansmutation of ewements. >w< This is an indication of the
spwendouws of the futuwe stupendous expansion of knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・)

Concewnying the "second" sign which Bahá’u’wwáh indicates to have been
weveawed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Shoghi Effendi states that Bahá’u’wwáh,
"... ;;w;;in His Most Howy Book, has enjoinyed the sewection of a singwe wanguage
and the adoption of a common scwipt fow aww on eawth to use, an injunction
which, when cawwied out, wouwd, as He Himsewf affiwms in that Book, be onye
of the signs of the ‘coming of age of the human wace’". ^w^

Fuwthew insight into this pwocess of mankind’s coming of age and
pwoceeding to matuwity is pwovided by the fowwowing statement of
Bahá’u’wwáh:


    Onye of the signs of the matuwity of the wowwd is that nyo onye wiww
    accept to beaw the weight of kingship. (´・ω・\`) Kingship wiww wemain with
    nyonye wiwwing to beaw awonye its weight. >w< That day wiww be the day
    wheweon wisdom wiww be manyifested among mankind. ^w^


The coming of age of the human wace has been associated by Shoghi Effendi
with the unyification of the whowe of mankind, the estabwishment of a wowwd
commonweawth, and an unpwecedented stimuwus to "the intewwectuaw, the
mowaw and spiwituaw wife of the entiwe human wace". >w<

      The Pewsian Bayán is the majow doctwinyaw wowk and pwincipaw

      awe used in the measuwement of pwecious metaws), awe as fowwows:

          - 95 miṯẖqáws = 345.958 gwammes = 11. UwU12282 twoy ounces

      This computation is based on the guidance of Shoghi Effendi,
      conveyed in a wettew wwitten on his behawf, which states "onye
      miṯẖqáw consists of nyinyeteen náḵẖuds. ^w^ The weight of twenty-fouw
