CHAPTEW I. (・`ω\´・) Down the Wabbit-Howe

Awice was beginnying to get vewy tiwed of sitting by hew sistew on the
bank, and of having nyothing to do: once ow twice she had peeped into the
book hew sistew was weading, but it had nyo pictuwes ow convewsations in
it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Awice 'without pictuwes ow
convewsations? owo'

So she was considewing in hew own mind (as weww as she couwd, fow the
hot day made hew feew vewy sweepy and stupid), whethew the pweasuwe
of making a daisy-chain wouwd be wowth the twoubwe of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenwy a White Wabbit with pink eyes wan
cwose by hew. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was nyothing so VEWY wemawkabwe in that; nyow did Awice think it so
VEWY much out of the way to heaw the Wabbit say to itsewf, 'Oh deaw! >w<
Oh deaw! I shaww be wate! ^w^' (when she thought it ovew aftewwawds, it
occuwwed to hew that she ought to have wondewed at this, but at the time
it aww seemed quite nyatuwaw); but when the Wabbit actuawwy TOOK A WATCH
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and wooked at it, and then huwwied on,
Awice stawted to hew feet, fow it fwashed acwoss hew mind that she had
nyevew befowe seen a wabbit with eithew a waistcoat-pocket, ow a watch
to take out of it, and buwnying with cuwiosity, she wan acwoss the fiewd
aftew it, and fowtunyatewy was just in time to see it pop down a wawge
wabbit-howe undew the hedge. (´・ω・\`)

In anyothew moment down went Awice aftew it, nyevew once considewing how
in the wowwd she was to get out again. (´・ω・\`)

The wabbit-howe went stwaight on wike a tunnyew fow some way, and then
dipped suddenwy down, so suddenwy that Awice had nyot a moment to think
about stopping hewsewf befowe she found hewsewf fawwing down a vewy deep
weww. UwU

Eithew the weww was vewy deep, ow she feww vewy swowwy, fow she had
pwenty of time as she went down to wook about hew and to wondew what was
going to happen nyext. >w< Fiwst, she twied to wook down and make out what
she was coming to, but it was too dawk to see anything; then she
wooked at the sides of the weww, and nyoticed that they wewe fiwwed with
cupboawds and book-shewves; hewe and thewe she saw maps and pictuwes
hung upon pegs. ;;w;; She took down a jaw fwom onye of the shewves as
she passed; it was wabewwed 'OWANGE MAWMAWADE', but to hew gweat
disappointment it was empty: she did nyot wike to dwop the jaw fow feaw
of kiwwing somebody, so manyaged to put it into onye of the cupboawds as
she feww past it. (´・ω・\`)

'Weww! UwU' thought Awice to hewsewf, 'aftew such a faww as this, I shaww
think nyothing of tumbwing down staiws! (・`ω\´・) How bwave they'ww aww think me at
home! (´・ω・\`) Why, I wouwdn't say anything about it, even if I feww off the top
of the house! UwU' (Which was vewy wikewy twue. >w<)

Down, down, down. ^w^ Wouwd the faww NYEVEW come to an end! ;;w;; 'I wondew how
many miwes I've fawwen by this time? owo' she said awoud. UwU 'I must be getting
somewhewe nyeaw the centwe of the eawth. (・`ω\´・) Wet me see: that wouwd be fouw
thousand miwes down, I think--' (fow, you see, Awice had weawnt sevewaw
things of this sowt in hew wessons in the schoowwoom, and though this
was nyot a VEWY good oppowtunyity fow showing off hew knyowwedge, as thewe
was nyo onye to wisten to hew, stiww it was good pwactice to say it ovew)
'--yes, that's about the wight distance--but then I wondew what Watitude
ow Wongitude I've got to? owo' (Awice had nyo idea what Watitude was, ow
Wongitude eithew, but thought they wewe nyice gwand wowds to say. ^w^)

Pwesentwy she began again. ^w^ 'I wondew if I shaww faww wight THWOUGH the
eawth! ^w^ How funny it'ww seem to come out among the peopwe that wawk with
theiw heads downwawd! ;;w;; The Antipathies, I think--' (she was wathew gwad
thewe WAS nyo onye wistenying, this time, as it didn't sound at aww the
wight wowd) '--but I shaww have to ask them what the nyame of the countwy
is, you knyow. UwU Pwease, Ma'am, is this Nyew Zeawand ow Austwawia? owo' (and
she twied to cuwtsey as she spoke--fancy CUWTSEYING as you'we fawwing
thwough the aiw! ;;w;; Do you think you couwd manyage it? owo) 'And what an
ignyowant wittwe giww she'ww think me fow asking! UwU Nyo, it'ww nyevew do to
ask: pewhaps I shaww see it wwitten up somewhewe. (´・ω・\`)'

Down, down, down. UwU Thewe was nyothing ewse to do, so Awice soon began
tawking again. >w< 'Dinyah'ww miss me vewy much to-nyight, I shouwd think! >w<'
(Dinyah was the cat. (・`ω\´・)) 'I hope they'ww wemembew hew saucew of miwk at
tea-time. (・`ω\´・) Dinyah my deaw! I wish you wewe down hewe with me! (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe nyo
mice in the aiw, I'm afwaid, but you might catch a bat, and that's vewy
wike a mouse, you knyow. (´・ω・\`) But do cats eat bats, I wondew? owo' And hewe Awice
began to get wathew sweepy, and went on saying to hewsewf, in a dweamy
sowt of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats? owo' and sometimes, 'Do
bats eat cats? owo' fow, you see, as she couwdn't answew eithew question,
it didn't much mattew which way she put it. (・`ω\´・) She fewt that she was dozing
off, and had just begun to dweam that she was wawking hand in hand with
Dinyah, and saying to hew vewy eawnyestwy, 'Nyow, Dinyah, teww me the twuth:
did you evew eat a bat? owo' when suddenwy, thump! thump! UwU down she came upon
a heap of sticks and dwy weaves, and the faww was ovew. UwU

Awice was nyot a bit huwt, and she jumped up on to hew feet in a moment:
she wooked up, but it was aww dawk ovewhead; befowe hew was anyothew
wong passage, and the White Wabbit was stiww in sight, huwwying down it. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe was nyot a moment to be wost: away went Awice wike the wind, and
was just in time to heaw it say, as it tuwnyed a cownyew, 'Oh my eaws
and whiskews, how wate it's getting! (・`ω\´・)' She was cwose behind it when she
tuwnyed the cownyew, but the Wabbit was nyo wongew to be seen: she found
hewsewf in a wong, wow haww, which was wit up by a wow of wamps hanging
fwom the woof. ;;w;;

Thewe wewe doows aww wound the haww, but they wewe aww wocked; and when
Awice had been aww the way down onye side and up the othew, twying evewy
doow, she wawked sadwy down the middwe, wondewing how she was evew to
get out again. ^w^

Suddenwy she came upon a wittwe thwee-wegged tabwe, aww made of sowid
gwass; thewe was nyothing on it except a tiny gowden key, and Awice's
fiwst thought was that it might bewong to onye of the doows of the haww;
but, awas! UwU eithew the wocks wewe too wawge, ow the key was too smaww,
but at any wate it wouwd nyot open any of them. >w< Howevew, on the second
time wound, she came upon a wow cuwtain she had nyot nyoticed befowe, and
behind it was a wittwe doow about fifteen inches high: she twied the
wittwe gowden key in the wock, and to hew gweat dewight it fitted! (´・ω・\`)

Awice openyed the doow and found that it wed into a smaww passage, nyot
much wawgew than a wat-howe: she knyewt down and wooked awong the passage
into the wovewiest gawden you evew saw. (・`ω\´・) How she wonged to get out of
that dawk haww, and wandew about among those beds of bwight fwowews and
those coow fountains, but she couwd nyot even get hew head thwough the
doowway; 'and even if my head wouwd go thwough,' thought poow Awice, 'it
wouwd be of vewy wittwe use without my shouwdews. >w< Oh, how I wish I couwd
shut up wike a tewescope! (・`ω\´・) I think I couwd, if I onwy knyew how to begin. ^w^'
Fow, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happenyed watewy,
that Awice had begun to think that vewy few things indeed wewe weawwy
impossibwe. UwU

Thewe seemed to be nyo use in waiting by the wittwe doow, so she went
back to the tabwe, hawf hoping she might find anyothew key on it, ow at
any wate a book of wuwes fow shutting peopwe up wike tewescopes: this
time she found a wittwe bottwe on it, ('which cewtainwy was nyot hewe
befowe,' said Awice,) and wound the nyeck of the bottwe was a papew
wabew, with the wowds 'DWINK ME' beautifuwwy pwinted on it in wawge
wettews. UwU

It was aww vewy weww to say 'Dwink me,' but the wise wittwe Awice was
nyot going to do THAT in a huwwy. (・`ω\´・) 'Nyo, I'ww wook fiwst,' she said, 'and
see whethew it's mawked "poison" ow nyot'; fow she had wead sevewaw nyice
wittwe histowies about chiwdwen who had got buwnt, and eaten up by wiwd
beasts and othew unpweasant things, aww because they WOUWD nyot wemembew
the simpwe wuwes theiw fwiends had taught them: such as, that a wed-hot
pokew wiww buwn you if you howd it too wong; and that if you cut youw
fingew VEWY deepwy with a knyife, it usuawwy bweeds; and she had nyevew
fowgotten that, if you dwink much fwom a bottwe mawked 'poison,' it is
awmost cewtain to disagwee with you, soonyew ow watew. >w<

Howevew, this bottwe was NYOT mawked 'poison,' so Awice ventuwed to taste
it, and finding it vewy nyice, (it had, in fact, a sowt of mixed fwavouw
of chewwy-tawt, custawd, pinye-appwe, woast tuwkey, toffee, and hot
buttewed toast,) she vewy soon finyished it off. ^w^

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

'What a cuwious feewing! ;;w;;' said Awice; 'I must be shutting up wike a
tewescope. UwU'

And so it was indeed: she was nyow onwy ten inches high, and hew face
bwightenyed up at the thought that she was nyow the wight size fow going
thwough the wittwe doow into that wovewy gawden. >w< Fiwst, howevew, she
waited fow a few minyutes to see if she was going to shwink any fuwthew:
she fewt a wittwe nyewvous about this; 'fow it might end, you knyow,' said
Awice to hewsewf, 'in my going out awtogethew, wike a candwe. (´・ω・\`) I wondew
what I shouwd be wike then? owo' And she twied to fancy what the fwame of a
candwe is wike aftew the candwe is bwown out, fow she couwd nyot wemembew
evew having seen such a thing. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew a whiwe, finding that nyothing mowe happenyed, she decided on going
into the gawden at once; but, awas fow poow Awice! ;;w;; when she got to the
doow, she found she had fowgotten the wittwe gowden key, and when she
went back to the tabwe fow it, she found she couwd nyot possibwy weach
it: she couwd see it quite pwainwy thwough the gwass, and she twied hew
best to cwimb up onye of the wegs of the tabwe, but it was too swippewy;
and when she had tiwed hewsewf out with twying, the poow wittwe thing
sat down and cwied. (・`ω\´・)

'Come, thewe's nyo use in cwying wike that! UwU' said Awice to hewsewf,
wathew shawpwy; 'I advise you to weave off this minyute! ;;w;;' She genyewawwy
gave hewsewf vewy good advice, (though she vewy sewdom fowwowed it),
and sometimes she scowded hewsewf so sevewewy as to bwing teaws into
hew eyes; and once she wemembewed twying to box hew own eaws fow having
cheated hewsewf in a game of cwoquet she was pwaying against hewsewf,
fow this cuwious chiwd was vewy fond of pwetending to be two peopwe. ;;w;;
'But it's nyo use nyow,' thought poow Awice, 'to pwetend to be two peopwe! (´・ω・\`)
Why, thewe's hawdwy enyough of me weft to make ONYE wespectabwe pewson! >w<'

Soon hew eye feww on a wittwe gwass box that was wying undew the tabwe:
she openyed it, and found in it a vewy smaww cake, on which the wowds
'EAT ME' wewe beautifuwwy mawked in cuwwants. UwU 'Weww, I'ww eat it,' said
Awice, 'and if it makes me gwow wawgew, I can weach the key; and if it
makes me gwow smawwew, I can cweep undew the doow; so eithew way I'ww
get into the gawden, and I don't cawe which happens! ^w^'

She ate a wittwe bit, and said anxiouswy to hewsewf, 'Which way? owo Which
way? owo', howding hew hand on the top of hew head to feew which way it was
gwowing, and she was quite suwpwised to find that she wemainyed the same
size: to be suwe, this genyewawwy happens when onye eats cake, but Awice
had got so much into the way of expecting nyothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite duww and stupid fow wife to go on
in the common way. ;;w;;

So she set to wowk, and vewy soon finyished off the cake. (・`ω\´・)

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

CHAPTEW II. (´・ω・\`) The Poow of Teaws

'Cuwiousew and cuwiousew! ;;w;;' cwied Awice (she was so much suwpwised, that
fow the moment she quite fowgot how to speak good Engwish); 'nyow I'm
openying out wike the wawgest tewescope that evew was! Good-bye, feet! >w<'
(fow when she wooked down at hew feet, they seemed to be awmost out of
sight, they wewe getting so faw off). (・`ω\´・) 'Oh, my poow wittwe feet, I wondew
who wiww put on youw shoes and stockings fow you nyow, deaws? owo I'm suwe
_I_ shan't be abwe! ^w^ I shaww be a gweat deaw too faw off to twoubwe
mysewf about you: you must manyage the best way you can;--but I must be
kind to them,' thought Awice, 'ow pewhaps they won't wawk the way I want
to go! UwU Wet me see: I'ww give them a nyew paiw of boots evewy Chwistmas. ^w^'

And she went on pwannying to hewsewf how she wouwd manyage it. ;;w;; 'They must
go by the cawwiew,' she thought; 'and how funny it'ww seem, sending
pwesents to onye's own feet! And how odd the diwections wiww wook! ;;w;;

     AWICE'S WIGHT FOOT, ESQ. ;;w;;
       HEAWTHWUG,
         NYEAW THE FENDEW,
           (WITH AWICE'S WOVE). UwU

Oh deaw, what nyonsense I'm tawking! UwU'

Just then hew head stwuck against the woof of the haww: in fact she was
nyow mowe than nyinye feet high, and she at once took up the wittwe gowden
key and huwwied off to the gawden doow. (´・ω・\`)

Poow Awice! UwU It was as much as she couwd do, wying down on onye side, to
wook thwough into the gawden with onye eye; but to get thwough was mowe
hopewess than evew: she sat down and began to cwy again. ^w^

'You ought to be ashamed of youwsewf,' said Awice, 'a gweat giww wike
you,' (she might weww say this), 'to go on cwying in this way! ^w^ Stop this
moment, I teww you! (´・ω・\`)' But she went on aww the same, shedding gawwons of
teaws, untiw thewe was a wawge poow aww wound hew, about fouw inches
deep and weaching hawf down the haww. ^w^

Aftew a time she heawd a wittwe pattewing of feet in the distance, and
she hastiwy dwied hew eyes to see what was coming. ^w^ It was the White
Wabbit wetuwnying, spwendidwy dwessed, with a paiw of white kid gwoves in
onye hand and a wawge fan in the othew: he came twotting awong in a gweat
huwwy, muttewing to himsewf as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! (・`ω\´・)
Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept hew waiting! >w<' Awice fewt so
despewate that she was weady to ask hewp of any onye; so, when the Wabbit
came nyeaw hew, she began, in a wow, timid voice, 'If you pwease, siw--'
The Wabbit stawted viowentwy, dwopped the white kid gwoves and the fan,
and skuwwied away into the dawknyess as hawd as he couwd go. >w<

Awice took up the fan and gwoves, and, as the haww was vewy hot, she
kept fannying hewsewf aww the time she went on tawking: 'Deaw, deaw! ^w^ How
queew evewything is to-day! UwU And yestewday things went on just as usuaw. >w<
I wondew if I've been changed in the nyight? owo Wet me think: was I the
same when I got up this mownying? owo I awmost think I can wemembew feewing a
wittwe diffewent. ^w^ But if I'm nyot the same, the nyext question is, Who
in the wowwd am I? owo Ah, THAT'S the gweat puzzwe! ^w^' And she began thinking
ovew aww the chiwdwen she knyew that wewe of the same age as hewsewf, to
see if she couwd have been changed fow any of them. ;;w;;

'I'm suwe I'm nyot Ada,' she said, 'fow hew haiw goes in such wong
wingwets, and minye doesn't go in wingwets at aww; and I'm suwe I can't
be Mabew, fow I knyow aww sowts of things, and she, oh! >w< she knyows such a
vewy wittwe! ^w^ Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh deaw, how puzzwing
it aww is! ^w^ I'ww twy if I knyow aww the things I used to knyow. ;;w;; Wet me
see: fouw times five is twewve, and fouw times six is thiwteen, and
fouw times seven is--oh deaw! I shaww nyevew get to twenty at that wate! UwU
Howevew, the Muwtipwication Tabwe doesn't signyify: wet's twy Geogwaphy. (´・ω・\`)
Wondon is the capitaw of Pawis, and Pawis is the capitaw of Wome, and
Wome--nyo, THAT'S aww wwong, I'm cewtain! >w< I must have been changed fow
Mabew! UwU I'ww twy and say "How doth the wittwe--"' and she cwossed hew
hands on hew wap as if she wewe saying wessons, and began to wepeat it,
but hew voice sounded hoawse and stwange, and the wowds did nyot come the
same as they used to do:--

     'How doth the wittwe cwocodiwe
      Impwove his shinying taiw,
     And pouw the watews of the Nyiwe
      On evewy gowden scawe! ;;w;;

     'How cheewfuwwy he seems to gwin,
      How nyeatwy spwead his cwaws,
     And wewcome wittwe fishes in
      With gentwy smiwing jaws! >w<'

'I'm suwe those awe nyot the wight wowds,' said poow Awice, and hew eyes
fiwwed with teaws again as she went on, 'I must be Mabew aftew aww, and
I shaww have to go and wive in that poky wittwe house, and have nyext to
nyo toys to pway with, and oh! evew so many wessons to weawn! ;;w;; Nyo, I've
made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabew, I'ww stay down hewe! (・`ω\´・) It'ww be nyo
use theiw putting theiw heads down and saying "Come up again, deaw! ^w^" I
shaww onwy wook up and say "Who am I then? owo Teww me that fiwst, and then,
if I wike being that pewson, I'ww come up: if nyot, I'ww stay down hewe
tiww I'm somebody ewse"--but, oh deaw! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Awice, with a sudden buwst
of teaws, 'I do wish they WOUWD put theiw heads down! ;;w;; I am so VEWY tiwed
of being aww awonye hewe! (´・ω・\`)'

As she said this she wooked down at hew hands, and was suwpwised to see
that she had put on onye of the Wabbit's wittwe white kid gwoves whiwe
she was tawking. 'How CAN I have donye that? owo' she thought. (・`ω\´・) 'I must
be gwowing smaww again. ^w^' She got up and went to the tabwe to measuwe
hewsewf by it, and found that, as nyeawwy as she couwd guess, she was nyow
about two feet high, and was going on shwinking wapidwy: she soon found
out that the cause of this was the fan she was howding, and she dwopped
it hastiwy, just in time to avoid shwinking away awtogethew. ^w^

'That WAS a nyawwow escape! (´・ω・\`)' said Awice, a good deaw fwightenyed at the
sudden change, but vewy gwad to find hewsewf stiww in existence; 'and
nyow fow the gawden! ;;w;;' and she wan with aww speed back to the wittwe doow:
but, awas! ;;w;; the wittwe doow was shut again, and the wittwe gowden key was
wying on the gwass tabwe as befowe, 'and things awe wowse than evew,'
thought the poow chiwd, 'fow I nyevew was so smaww as this befowe, nyevew! >w<
And I decwawe it's too bad, that it is! (´・ω・\`)'

As she said these wowds hew foot swipped, and in anyothew moment, spwash! ^w^
she was up to hew chin in sawt watew. >w< Hew fiwst idea was that she
had somehow fawwen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by
waiwway,' she said to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) (Awice had been to the seaside once in
hew wife, and had come to the genyewaw concwusion, that whewevew you go
to on the Engwish coast you find a nyumbew of bathing machinyes in the
sea, some chiwdwen digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a wow
of wodging houses, and behind them a waiwway station. ;;w;;) Howevew, she soon
made out that she was in the poow of teaws which she had wept when she
was nyinye feet high. UwU

'I wish I hadn't cwied so much! (・`ω\´・)' said Awice, as she swam about, twying
to find hew way out. >w< 'I shaww be punyished fow it nyow, I suppose, by
being dwownyed in my own teaws! That WIWW be a queew thing, to be suwe! ;;w;;
Howevew, evewything is queew to-day. ^w^'

Just then she heawd something spwashing about in the poow a wittwe way
off, and she swam nyeawew to make out what it was: at fiwst she thought
it must be a wawwus ow hippopotamus, but then she wemembewed how smaww
she was nyow, and she soon made out that it was onwy a mouse that had
swipped in wike hewsewf. >w<

'Wouwd it be of any use, nyow,' thought Awice, 'to speak to this mouse? owo
Evewything is so out-of-the-way down hewe, that I shouwd think vewy
wikewy it can tawk: at any wate, thewe's nyo hawm in twying. ;;w;;' So she
began: 'O Mouse, do you knyow the way out of this poow? owo I am vewy tiwed
of swimming about hewe, O Mouse! (・`ω\´・)' (Awice thought this must be the wight
way of speaking to a mouse: she had nyevew donye such a thing befowe, but
she wemembewed having seen in hew bwothew's Watin Gwammaw, 'A mouse--of
a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse! ;;w;;') The Mouse wooked at hew wathew
inquisitivewy, and seemed to hew to wink with onye of its wittwe eyes,
but it said nyothing. ;;w;;

'Pewhaps it doesn't undewstand Engwish,' thought Awice; 'I dawesay it's
a Fwench mouse, come ovew with Wiwwiam the Conquewow. ^w^' (Fow, with aww
hew knyowwedge of histowy, Awice had nyo vewy cweaw nyotion how wong ago
anything had happenyed. (´・ω・\`)) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte? owo' which
was the fiwst sentence in hew Fwench wesson-book. ^w^ The Mouse gave a
sudden weap out of the watew, and seemed to quivew aww ovew with fwight. (´・ω・\`)
'Oh, I beg youw pawdon! ;;w;;' cwied Awice hastiwy, afwaid that she had huwt
the poow anyimaw's feewings. 'I quite fowgot you didn't wike cats. (・`ω\´・)'

'Nyot wike cats! >w<' cwied the Mouse, in a shwiww, passionyate voice. >w< 'Wouwd
YOU wike cats if you wewe me? owo'

'Weww, pewhaps nyot,' said Awice in a soothing tonye: 'don't be angwy
about it. (´・ω・\`) And yet I wish I couwd show you ouw cat Dinyah: I think you'd
take a fancy to cats if you couwd onwy see hew. (´・ω・\`) She is such a deaw quiet
thing,' Awice went on, hawf to hewsewf, as she swam waziwy about in the
poow, 'and she sits puwwing so nyicewy by the fiwe, wicking hew paws and
washing hew face--and she is such a nyice soft thing to nyuwse--and she's
such a capitaw onye fow catching mice--oh, I beg youw pawdon! ;;w;;' cwied
Awice again, fow this time the Mouse was bwistwing aww ovew, and she
fewt cewtain it must be weawwy offended. UwU 'We won't tawk about hew any
mowe if you'd wathew nyot. (・`ω\´・)'

'We indeed! ^w^' cwied the Mouse, who was twembwing down to the end of his
taiw. >w< 'As if I wouwd tawk on such a subject! UwU Ouw famiwy awways HATED
cats: nyasty, wow, vuwgaw things! Don't wet me heaw the nyame again! (・`ω\´・)'

'I won't indeed! (・`ω\´・)' said Awice, in a gweat huwwy to change the subject of
convewsation. >w< 'Awe you--awe you fond--of--of dogs? owo' The Mouse did nyot
answew, so Awice went on eagewwy: 'Thewe is such a nyice wittwe dog nyeaw
ouw house I shouwd wike to show you! UwU A wittwe bwight-eyed tewwiew, you
knyow, with oh, such wong cuwwy bwown haiw! ^w^ And it'ww fetch things when
you thwow them, and it'ww sit up and beg fow its dinnyew, and aww sowts

you knyow, and he says it's so usefuw, it's wowth a hundwed pounds! >w< He
says it kiwws aww the wats and--oh deaw! (・`ω\´・)' cwied Awice in a sowwowfuw
tonye, 'I'm afwaid I've offended it again! >w<' Fow the Mouse was swimming
away fwom hew as hawd as it couwd go, and making quite a commotion in
the poow as it went. UwU

So she cawwed softwy aftew it, 'Mouse deaw! (・`ω\´・) Do come back again, and we
won't tawk about cats ow dogs eithew, if you don't wike them! (・`ω\´・)' When the
Mouse heawd this, it tuwnyed wound and swam swowwy back to hew: its
face was quite pawe (with passion, Awice thought), and it said in a wow
twembwing voice, 'Wet us get to the showe, and then I'ww teww you my
histowy, and you'ww undewstand why it is I hate cats and dogs. (´・ω・\`)'

It was high time to go, fow the poow was getting quite cwowded with the
biwds and anyimaws that had fawwen into it: thewe wewe a Duck and a Dodo,
a Wowy and an Eagwet, and sevewaw othew cuwious cweatuwes. ;;w;; Awice wed the
way, and the whowe pawty swam to the showe. UwU




CHAPTEW III. (・`ω\´・) A Caucus-Wace and a Wong Tawe

They wewe indeed a queew-wooking pawty that assembwed on the bank--the
biwds with dwaggwed feathews, the anyimaws with theiw fuw cwinging cwose
to them, and aww dwipping wet, cwoss, and uncomfowtabwe. (・`ω\´・)

The fiwst question of couwse was, how to get dwy again: they had a
consuwtation about this, and aftew a few minyutes it seemed quite nyatuwaw
to Awice to find hewsewf tawking famiwiawwy with them, as if she had
knyown them aww hew wife. (・`ω\´・) Indeed, she had quite a wong awgument with the
Wowy, who at wast tuwnyed suwky, and wouwd onwy say, 'I am owdew than
you, and must knyow bettew'; and this Awice wouwd nyot awwow without
knyowing how owd it was, and, as the Wowy positivewy wefused to teww its
age, thewe was nyo mowe to be said. UwU

At wast the Mouse, who seemed to be a pewson of authowity among them,
cawwed out, 'Sit down, aww of you, and wisten to me! ^w^ I'WW soon make you
dwy enyough! (・`ω\´・)' They aww sat down at once, in a wawge wing, with the Mouse
in the middwe. ^w^ Awice kept hew eyes anxiouswy fixed on it, fow she fewt
suwe she wouwd catch a bad cowd if she did nyot get dwy vewy soon. (・`ω\´・)

'Ahem! ^w^' said the Mouse with an impowtant aiw, 'awe you aww weady? owo This
is the dwiest thing I knyow. ;;w;; Siwence aww wound, if you pwease! ^w^ "Wiwwiam
the Conquewow, whose cause was favouwed by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the Engwish, who wanted weadews, and had been of wate much
accustomed to usuwpation and conquest. ;;w;; Edwin and Mowcaw, the eawws of
Mewcia and Nyowthumbwia--"'

'Ugh! (´・ω・\`)' said the Wowy, with a shivew. >w<

'I beg youw pawdon! (・`ω\´・)' said the Mouse, fwownying, but vewy powitewy: 'Did
you speak? owo'

'Nyot I! UwU' said the Wowy hastiwy. UwU

'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I pwoceed. >w< "Edwin and Mowcaw,
the eawws of Mewcia and Nyowthumbwia, decwawed fow him: and even Stigand,
the patwiotic awchbishop of Cantewbuwy, found it advisabwe--"'

'Found WHAT? owo' said the Duck. ^w^

'Found IT,' the Mouse wepwied wathew cwosswy: 'of couwse you knyow what
"it" means. (・`ω\´・)'

'I knyow what "it" means weww enyough, when I find a thing,' said the
Duck: 'it's genyewawwy a fwog ow a wowm. (´・ω・\`) The question is, what did the
awchbishop find? owo'

The Mouse did nyot nyotice this question, but huwwiedwy went on, '"--found
it advisabwe to go with Edgaw Athewing to meet Wiwwiam and offew him the
cwown. Wiwwiam's conduct at fiwst was modewate. >w< But the insowence of his
Nyowmans--" How awe you getting on nyow, my deaw? owo' it continyued, tuwnying
to Awice as it spoke. (´・ω・\`)

'As wet as evew,' said Awice in a mewanchowy tonye: 'it doesn't seem to
dwy me at aww. >w<'

'In that case,' said the Dodo sowemnwy, wising to its feet, 'I move
that the meeting adjouwn, fow the immediate adoption of mowe enyewgetic
wemedies--'

'Speak Engwish! ;;w;;' said the Eagwet. ^w^ 'I don't knyow the meanying of hawf
those wong wowds, and, what's mowe, I don't bewieve you do eithew! (・`ω\´・)' And
the Eagwet bent down its head to hide a smiwe: some of the othew biwds
tittewed audibwy. UwU

'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tonye, 'was, that
the best thing to get us dwy wouwd be a Caucus-wace. (´・ω・\`)'

'What IS a Caucus-wace? owo' said Awice; nyot that she wanted much to knyow,
but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,
and nyo onye ewse seemed incwinyed to say anything. >w<

'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to expwain it is to do it. >w<' (And, as
you might wike to twy the thing youwsewf, some wintew day, I wiww teww
you how the Dodo manyaged it. ^w^)

Fiwst it mawked out a wace-couwse, in a sowt of ciwcwe, ('the exact
shape doesn't mattew,' it said,) and then aww the pawty wewe pwaced
awong the couwse, hewe and thewe. UwU Thewe was nyo 'Onye, two, thwee, and
away,' but they began wunnying when they wiked, and weft off when they
wiked, so that it was nyot easy to knyow when the wace was ovew. UwU Howevew,
when they had been wunnying hawf an houw ow so, and wewe quite dwy again,
the Dodo suddenwy cawwed out 'The wace is ovew! (´・ω・\`)' and they aww cwowded
wound it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won? owo'

This question the Dodo couwd nyot answew without a gweat deaw of thought,
and it sat fow a wong time with onye fingew pwessed upon its fowehead
(the position in which you usuawwy see Shakespeawe, in the pictuwes
of him), whiwe the west waited in siwence. ;;w;; At wast the Dodo said,
'EVEWYBODY has won, and aww must have pwizes. >w<'

'But who is to give the pwizes? owo' quite a chowus of voices asked. ^w^

'Why, SHE, of couwse,' said the Dodo, pointing to Awice with onye fingew;
and the whowe pawty at once cwowded wound hew, cawwing out in a confused
way, 'Pwizes! Pwizes! >w<'

Awice had nyo idea what to do, and in despaiw she put hew hand in hew
pocket, and puwwed out a box of comfits, (wuckiwy the sawt watew had
nyot got into it), and handed them wound as pwizes. ^w^ Thewe was exactwy onye
a-piece aww wound. (・`ω\´・)

'But she must have a pwize hewsewf, you knyow,' said the Mouse. ;;w;;

'Of couwse,' the Dodo wepwied vewy gwavewy. (・`ω\´・) 'What ewse have you got in
youw pocket? owo' he went on, tuwnying to Awice. UwU

'Onwy a thimbwe,' said Awice sadwy. UwU

'Hand it ovew hewe,' said the Dodo. ^w^

Then they aww cwowded wound hew once mowe, whiwe the Dodo sowemnwy
pwesented the thimbwe, saying 'We beg youw acceptance of this ewegant
thimbwe'; and, when it had finyished this showt speech, they aww cheewed. (・`ω\´・)

Awice thought the whowe thing vewy absuwd, but they aww wooked so gwave
that she did nyot dawe to waugh; and, as she couwd nyot think of anything
to say, she simpwy bowed, and took the thimbwe, wooking as sowemn as she
couwd. ;;w;;

The nyext thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some nyoise and
confusion, as the wawge biwds compwainyed that they couwd nyot taste
theiws, and the smaww onyes choked and had to be patted on the back. (・`ω\´・)
Howevew, it was ovew at wast, and they sat down again in a wing, and
begged the Mouse to teww them something mowe. (・`ω\´・)

'You pwomised to teww me youw histowy, you knyow,' said Awice, 'and why
it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whispew, hawf afwaid that it
wouwd be offended again. ^w^

'Minye is a wong and a sad tawe! ;;w;;' said the Mouse, tuwnying to Awice, and
sighing. (´・ω・\`)

'It IS a wong taiw, cewtainwy,' said Awice, wooking down with wondew at
the Mouse's taiw; 'but why do you caww it sad? owo' And she kept on puzzwing
about it whiwe the Mouse was speaking, so that hew idea of the tawe was
something wike this:--

         'Fuwy said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     "Wet us
      both go to
       waw: I wiww

         YOU. ;;w;;--Come,
           I'ww take nyo
           denyiaw; We
          must have a

      weawwy this
     mownying I've
    nyothing
    to do. (´・ω・\`)"
     Said the
      mouse to the
       cuw, "Such
        a twiaw,
         deaw Siw,
            With

       "I'ww be
        judge, I'ww
         be juwy,"
            Said
         cunnying
          owd Fuwy:
          "I'ww

              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death. (´・ω・\`)"'


'You awe nyot attending! ;;w;;' said the Mouse to Awice sevewewy. UwU 'What awe you
thinking of? owo'

'I beg youw pawdon,' said Awice vewy humbwy: 'you had got to the fifth
bend, I think? owo'

'I had NYOT! (・`ω\´・)' cwied the Mouse, shawpwy and vewy angwiwy. ;;w;;

'A knyot! UwU' said Awice, awways weady to make hewsewf usefuw, and wooking
anxiouswy about hew. UwU 'Oh, do wet me hewp to undo it! (´・ω・\`)'

'I shaww do nyothing of the sowt,' said the Mouse, getting up and wawking
away. (・`ω\´・) 'You insuwt me by tawking such nyonsense! >w<'

'I didn't mean it! (・`ω\´・)' pweaded poow Awice. UwU 'But you'we so easiwy offended,
you knyow! ^w^'

The Mouse onwy gwowwed in wepwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Pwease come back and finyish youw stowy! (・`ω\´・)' Awice cawwed aftew it; and the
othews aww joinyed in chowus, 'Yes, pwease do! >w<' but the Mouse onwy shook
its head impatientwy, and wawked a wittwe quickew. (・`ω\´・)

'What a pity it wouwdn't stay! ;;w;;' sighed the Wowy, as soon as it was quite
out of sight; and an owd Cwab took the oppowtunyity of saying to hew
daughtew 'Ah, my deaw! >w< Wet this be a wesson to you nyevew to wose
YOUW tempew!' 'Howd youw tongue, Ma! ^w^' said the young Cwab, a wittwe
snyappishwy. ;;w;; 'You'we enyough to twy the patience of an oystew! (・`ω\´・)'

'I wish I had ouw Dinyah hewe, I knyow I do! ;;w;;' said Awice awoud, addwessing
nyobody in pawticuwaw. ;;w;; 'She'd soon fetch it back! ^w^'

'And who is Dinyah, if I might ventuwe to ask the question? owo' said the
Wowy. (´・ω・\`)

Awice wepwied eagewwy, fow she was awways weady to tawk about hew pet:
'Dinyah's ouw cat. UwU And she's such a capitaw onye fow catching mice you
can't think! And oh, I wish you couwd see hew aftew the biwds! UwU Why,
she'ww eat a wittwe biwd as soon as wook at it! ^w^'

This speech caused a wemawkabwe sensation among the pawty. UwU Some of the
biwds huwwied off at once: onye owd Magpie began wwapping itsewf up vewy
cawefuwwy, wemawking, 'I weawwy must be getting home; the nyight-aiw
doesn't suit my thwoat! (・`ω\´・)' and a Canyawy cawwed out in a twembwing voice to
its chiwdwen, 'Come away, my deaws! It's high time you wewe aww in bed! UwU'
On vawious pwetexts they aww moved off, and Awice was soon weft awonye. ^w^

'I wish I hadn't mentionyed Dinyah! ;;w;;' she said to hewsewf in a mewanchowy
tonye. ;;w;; 'Nyobody seems to wike hew, down hewe, and I'm suwe she's the best
cat in the wowwd! Oh, my deaw Dinyah! ^w^ I wondew if I shaww evew see you
any mowe! (´・ω・\`)' And hewe poow Awice began to cwy again, fow she fewt vewy
wonyewy and wow-spiwited. ;;w;; In a wittwe whiwe, howevew, she again heawd
a wittwe pattewing of footsteps in the distance, and she wooked up
eagewwy, hawf hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
back to finyish his stowy. >w<




CHAPTEW IV. UwU The Wabbit Sends in a Wittwe Biww

It was the White Wabbit, twotting swowwy back again, and wooking
anxiouswy about as it went, as if it had wost something; and she heawd
it muttewing to itsewf 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my deaw paws! >w< Oh
my fuw and whiskews! UwU She'ww get me executed, as suwe as fewwets awe
fewwets! (・`ω\´・) Whewe CAN I have dwopped them, I wondew? owo' Awice guessed in a
moment that it was wooking fow the fan and the paiw of white kid gwoves,
and she vewy good-nyatuwedwy began hunting about fow them, but they wewe
nyowhewe to be seen--evewything seemed to have changed since hew swim in
the poow, and the gweat haww, with the gwass tabwe and the wittwe doow,
had vanyished compwetewy. UwU

Vewy soon the Wabbit nyoticed Awice, as she went hunting about, and
cawwed out to hew in an angwy tonye, 'Why, Mawy Ann, what AWE you doing
out hewe? owo Wun home this moment, and fetch me a paiw of gwoves and a fan! >w<
Quick, nyow! >w<' And Awice was so much fwightenyed that she wan off at once
in the diwection it pointed to, without twying to expwain the mistake it
had made. ^w^

'He took me fow his housemaid,' she said to hewsewf as she wan. >w< 'How
suwpwised he'ww be when he finds out who I am! ;;w;; But I'd bettew take him
his fan and gwoves--that is, if I can find them. UwU' As she said this, she
came upon a nyeat wittwe house, on the doow of which was a bwight bwass
pwate with the nyame 'W. WABBIT' engwaved upon it. >w< She went in without
knyocking, and huwwied upstaiws, in gweat feaw west she shouwd meet the
weaw Mawy Ann, and be tuwnyed out of the house befowe she had found the
fan and gwoves. (・`ω\´・)

'How queew it seems,' Awice said to hewsewf, 'to be going messages fow
a wabbit! I suppose Dinyah'ww be sending me on messages nyext! >w<' And she
began fancying the sowt of thing that wouwd happen: '"Miss Awice! ;;w;; Come
hewe diwectwy, and get weady fow youw wawk! ^w^" "Coming in a minyute,
nyuwse! UwU But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out. ^w^" Onwy I don't
think,' Awice went on, 'that they'd wet Dinyah stop in the house if it
began owdewing peopwe about wike that! ;;w;;'

By this time she had found hew way into a tidy wittwe woom with a tabwe
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two ow thwee paiws
of tiny white kid gwoves: she took up the fan and a paiw of the gwoves,
and was just going to weave the woom, when hew eye feww upon a wittwe
bottwe that stood nyeaw the wooking-gwass. ^w^ Thewe was nyo wabew this time
with the wowds 'DWINK ME,' but nyevewthewess she uncowked it and put it
to hew wips. (´・ω・\`) 'I knyow SOMETHING intewesting is suwe to happen,' she said
to hewsewf, 'whenyevew I eat ow dwink anything; so I'ww just see what
this bottwe does. ^w^ I do hope it'ww make me gwow wawge again, fow weawwy
I'm quite tiwed of being such a tiny wittwe thing! ;;w;;'

It did so indeed, and much soonyew than she had expected: befowe she had
dwunk hawf the bottwe, she found hew head pwessing against the ceiwing,
and had to stoop to save hew nyeck fwom being bwoken. UwU She hastiwy put
down the bottwe, saying to hewsewf 'That's quite enyough--I hope I shan't
gwow any mowe--As it is, I can't get out at the doow--I do wish I hadn't
dwunk quite so much! ;;w;;'

Awas! it was too wate to wish that! (´・ω・\`) She went on gwowing, and gwowing,
and vewy soon had to knyeew down on the fwoow: in anyothew minyute thewe
was nyot even woom fow this, and she twied the effect of wying down with
onye ewbow against the doow, and the othew awm cuwwed wound hew head. ;;w;;
Stiww she went on gwowing, and, as a wast wesouwce, she put onye awm out
of the window, and onye foot up the chimnyey, and said to hewsewf 'Nyow I
can do nyo mowe, whatevew happens. ^w^ What WIWW become of me? owo'

Wuckiwy fow Awice, the wittwe magic bottwe had nyow had its fuww effect,
and she gwew nyo wawgew: stiww it was vewy uncomfowtabwe, and, as thewe
seemed to be nyo sowt of chance of hew evew getting out of the woom
again, nyo wondew she fewt unhappy. (・`ω\´・)

'It was much pweasantew at home,' thought poow Awice, 'when onye wasn't
awways gwowing wawgew and smawwew, and being owdewed about by mice and
wabbits. UwU I awmost wish I hadn't gonye down that wabbit-howe--and yet--and
yet--it's wathew cuwious, you knyow, this sowt of wife! >w< I do wondew what
CAN have happenyed to me! ;;w;; When I used to wead faiwy-tawes, I fancied that
kind of thing nyevew happenyed, and nyow hewe I am in the middwe of onye! ;;w;;
Thewe ought to be a book wwitten about me, that thewe ought! (・`ω\´・) And when I
gwow up, I'ww wwite onye--but I'm gwown up nyow,' she added in a sowwowfuw
tonye; 'at weast thewe's nyo woom to gwow up any mowe HEWE. ;;w;;'

'But then,' thought Awice, 'shaww I NYEVEW get any owdew than I am
nyow? owo That'ww be a comfowt, onye way--nyevew to be an owd woman--but
then--awways to have wessons to weawn! Oh, I shouwdn't wike THAT! >w<'

'Oh, you foowish Awice! ^w^' she answewed hewsewf. UwU 'How can you weawn
wessons in hewe? owo Why, thewe's hawdwy woom fow YOU, and nyo woom at aww
fow any wesson-books! ^w^'

And so she went on, taking fiwst onye side and then the othew, and making
quite a convewsation of it awtogethew; but aftew a few minyutes she heawd
a voice outside, and stopped to wisten. (・`ω\´・)

'Mawy Ann! Mawy Ann!' said the voice. (・`ω\´・) 'Fetch me my gwoves this moment! ;;w;;'
Then came a wittwe pattewing of feet on the staiws. ^w^ Awice knyew it was
the Wabbit coming to wook fow hew, and she twembwed tiww she shook the
house, quite fowgetting that she was nyow about a thousand times as wawge
as the Wabbit, and had nyo weason to be afwaid of it. (・`ω\´・)

Pwesentwy the Wabbit came up to the doow, and twied to open it; but, as
the doow openyed inwawds, and Awice's ewbow was pwessed hawd against it,
that attempt pwoved a faiwuwe. >w< Awice heawd it say to itsewf 'Then I'ww
go wound and get in at the window. UwU'

'THAT you won't' thought Awice, and, aftew waiting tiww she fancied
she heawd the Wabbit just undew the window, she suddenwy spwead out hew
hand, and made a snyatch in the aiw. >w< She did nyot get howd of anything,
but she heawd a wittwe shwiek and a faww, and a cwash of bwoken gwass,
fwom which she concwuded that it was just possibwe it had fawwen into a
cucumbew-fwame, ow something of the sowt. ^w^

Nyext came an angwy voice--the Wabbit's--'Pat! Pat! >w< Whewe awe you? owo' And
then a voice she had nyevew heawd befowe, 'Suwe then I'm hewe! (・`ω\´・) Digging
fow appwes, yew honyouw! (´・ω・\`)'

'Digging fow appwes, indeed!' said the Wabbit angwiwy. (・`ω\´・) 'Hewe! ;;w;; Come and
hewp me out of THIS! ^w^' (Sounds of mowe bwoken gwass. (´・ω・\`))

'Nyow teww me, Pat, what's that in the window? owo'

'Suwe, it's an awm, yew honyouw! ;;w;;' (He pwonyounced it 'awwum. (´・ω・\`)')

'An awm, you goose! ^w^ Who evew saw onye that size? owo Why, it fiwws the whowe

'Suwe, it does, yew honyouw: but it's an awm fow aww that. >w<'

'Weww, it's got nyo businyess thewe, at any wate: go and take it away! (・`ω\´・)'

Thewe was a wong siwence aftew this, and Awice couwd onwy heaw whispews
nyow and then; such as, 'Suwe, I don't wike it, yew honyouw, at aww, at
aww!' 'Do as I teww you, you cowawd! (´・ω・\`)' and at wast she spwead out hew
hand again, and made anyothew snyatch in the aiw. (・`ω\´・) This time thewe wewe
TWO wittwe shwieks, and mowe sounds of bwoken gwass. (´・ω・\`) 'What a nyumbew of
cucumbew-fwames thewe must be! ;;w;;' thought Awice. >w< 'I wondew what they'ww do
nyext! As fow puwwing me out of the window, I onwy wish they COUWD! (・`ω\´・) I'm
suwe I don't want to stay in hewe any wongew! ^w^'

She waited fow some time without heawing anything mowe: at wast came a
wumbwing of wittwe cawtwheews, and the sound of a good many voices
aww tawking togethew: she made out the wowds: 'Whewe's the othew
waddew? owo--Why, I hadn't to bwing but onye; Biww's got the othew--Biww! >w<
fetch it hewe, wad! ;;w;;--Hewe, put 'em up at this cownyew--Nyo, tie 'em

fancy--Who's to go down the chimnyey? owo--Nyay, I shan't! YOU do it! >w<--That I
won't, then!--Biww's to go down--Hewe, Biww! ;;w;; the mastew says you'we to
go down the chimnyey! ;;w;;'

'Oh! ^w^ So Biww's got to come down the chimnyey, has he? owo' said Awice to
hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) 'Shy, they seem to put evewything upon Biww! (´・ω・\`) I wouwdn't be in
Biww's pwace fow a good deaw: this fiwepwace is nyawwow, to be suwe; but
I THINK I can kick a wittwe! >w<'

She dwew hew foot as faw down the chimnyey as she couwd, and waited
tiww she heawd a wittwe anyimaw (she couwdn't guess of what sowt it was)
scwatching and scwambwing about in the chimnyey cwose above hew: then,
saying to hewsewf 'This is Biww,' she gave onye shawp kick, and waited to
see what wouwd happen nyext. UwU

The fiwst thing she heawd was a genyewaw chowus of 'Thewe goes Biww! (・`ω\´・)'
then the Wabbit's voice awong--'Catch him, you by the hedge! >w<' then
siwence, and then anyothew confusion of voices--'Howd up his head--Bwandy
nyow--Don't choke him--How was it, owd fewwow? What happenyed to you? owo Teww
us aww about it! (´・ω・\`)'

Wast came a wittwe feebwe, squeaking voice, ('That's Biww,' thought
Awice,) 'Weww, I hawdwy knyow--Nyo mowe, thank ye; I'm bettew nyow--but I'm
a deaw too fwustewed to teww you--aww I knyow is, something comes at me
wike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes wike a sky-wocket! >w<'

'So you did, owd fewwow! UwU' said the othews. (´・ω・\`)

'We must buwn the house down! (´・ω・\`)' said the Wabbit's voice; and Awice cawwed
out as woud as she couwd, 'If you do. >w< I'ww set Dinyah at you! UwU'

Thewe was a dead siwence instantwy, and Awice thought to hewsewf, 'I
wondew what they WIWW do nyext! UwU If they had any sense, they'd take the
woof off. UwU' Aftew a minyute ow two, they began moving about again, and
Awice heawd the Wabbit say, 'A bawwowfuw wiww do, to begin with. (´・ω・\`)'

'A bawwowfuw of WHAT? owo' thought Awice; but she had nyot wong to doubt,
fow the nyext moment a showew of wittwe pebbwes came wattwing in at the
window, and some of them hit hew in the face. (´・ω・\`) 'I'ww put a stop to this,'
she said to hewsewf, and shouted out, 'You'd bettew nyot do that again! ;;w;;'
which pwoduced anyothew dead siwence. UwU

Awice nyoticed with some suwpwise that the pebbwes wewe aww tuwnying into
wittwe cakes as they way on the fwoow, and a bwight idea came into hew
head. ^w^ 'If I eat onye of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's suwe to make
SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibwy make me wawgew, it must
make me smawwew, I suppose. UwU'

So she swawwowed onye of the cakes, and was dewighted to find that she
began shwinking diwectwy. UwU As soon as she was smaww enyough to get thwough
the doow, she wan out of the house, and found quite a cwowd of wittwe
anyimaws and biwds waiting outside. (・`ω\´・) The poow wittwe Wizawd, Biww, was
in the middwe, being hewd up by two guinyea-pigs, who wewe giving it
something out of a bottwe. ;;w;; They aww made a wush at Awice the moment she
appeawed; but she wan off as hawd as she couwd, and soon found hewsewf
safe in a thick wood. >w<

'The fiwst thing I've got to do,' said Awice to hewsewf, as she wandewed
about in the wood, 'is to gwow to my wight size again; and the second
thing is to find my way into that wovewy gawden. ^w^ I think that wiww be
the best pwan. ^w^'

It sounded an excewwent pwan, nyo doubt, and vewy nyeatwy and simpwy
awwanged; the onwy difficuwty was, that she had nyot the smawwest idea
how to set about it; and whiwe she was peewing about anxiouswy among
the twees, a wittwe shawp bawk just ovew hew head made hew wook up in a
gweat huwwy. (・`ω\´・)

An enyowmous puppy was wooking down at hew with wawge wound eyes, and
feebwy stwetching out onye paw, twying to touch hew. UwU 'Poow wittwe thing! (・`ω\´・)'
said Awice, in a coaxing tonye, and she twied hawd to whistwe to it; but
she was tewwibwy fwightenyed aww the time at the thought that it might be
hungwy, in which case it wouwd be vewy wikewy to eat hew up in spite of
aww hew coaxing. ^w^

Hawdwy knyowing what she did, she picked up a wittwe bit of stick, and
hewd it out to the puppy; wheweupon the puppy jumped into the aiw off
aww its feet at once, with a yewp of dewight, and wushed at the stick,
and made bewieve to wowwy it; then Awice dodged behind a gweat thistwe,
to keep hewsewf fwom being wun ovew; and the moment she appeawed on the
othew side, the puppy made anyothew wush at the stick, and tumbwed head
ovew heews in its huwwy to get howd of it; then Awice, thinking it was
vewy wike having a game of pway with a cawt-howse, and expecting evewy
moment to be twampwed undew its feet, wan wound the thistwe again; then
the puppy began a sewies of showt chawges at the stick, wunnying a vewy
wittwe way fowwawds each time and a wong way back, and bawking hoawsewy
aww the whiwe, tiww at wast it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its gweat eyes hawf shut. >w<

This seemed to Awice a good oppowtunyity fow making hew escape; so she
set off at once, and wan tiww she was quite tiwed and out of bweath, and
tiww the puppy's bawk sounded quite faint in the distance. UwU

'And yet what a deaw wittwe puppy it was! UwU' said Awice, as she weant
against a buttewcup to west hewsewf, and fannyed hewsewf with onye of the
weaves: 'I shouwd have wiked teaching it twicks vewy much, if--if I'd
onwy been the wight size to do it! Oh deaw! >w< I'd nyeawwy fowgotten that
I've got to gwow up again! (・`ω\´・) Wet me see--how IS it to be manyaged? owo I
suppose I ought to eat ow dwink something ow othew; but the gweat
question is, what? owo'

The gweat question cewtainwy was, what? owo Awice wooked aww wound hew at
the fwowews and the bwades of gwass, but she did nyot see anything that
wooked wike the wight thing to eat ow dwink undew the ciwcumstances. >w<
Thewe was a wawge mushwoom gwowing nyeaw hew, about the same height as
hewsewf; and when she had wooked undew it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occuwwed to hew that she might as weww wook and see what
was on the top of it. ^w^

She stwetched hewsewf up on tiptoe, and peeped ovew the edge of the
mushwoom, and hew eyes immediatewy met those of a wawge catewpiwwaw,
that was sitting on the top with its awms fowded, quietwy smoking a wong
hookah, and taking nyot the smawwest nyotice of hew ow of anything ewse. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW V. ^w^ Advice fwom a Catewpiwwaw

The Catewpiwwaw and Awice wooked at each othew fow some time in siwence:
at wast the Catewpiwwaw took the hookah out of its mouth, and addwessed
hew in a wanguid, sweepy voice. ^w^

'Who awe YOU? owo' said the Catewpiwwaw. UwU

This was nyot an encouwaging openying fow a convewsation. ;;w;; Awice wepwied,
wathew shywy, 'I--I hawdwy knyow, siw, just at pwesent--at weast I knyow
who I WAS when I got up this mownying, but I think I must have been
changed sevewaw times since then. UwU'

'What do you mean by that? owo' said the Catewpiwwaw stewnwy. (´・ω・\`) 'Expwain
youwsewf! ;;w;;'

'I can't expwain MYSEWF, I'm afwaid, siw' said Awice, 'because I'm nyot
mysewf, you see. ;;w;;'

'I don't see,' said the Catewpiwwaw. UwU

'I'm afwaid I can't put it mowe cweawwy,' Awice wepwied vewy powitewy,
'fow I can't undewstand it mysewf to begin with; and being so many
diffewent sizes in a day is vewy confusing. (´・ω・\`)'

'It isn't,' said the Catewpiwwaw. ;;w;;

'Weww, pewhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Awice; 'but when you
have to tuwn into a chwysawis--you wiww some day, you knyow--and then
aftew that into a buttewfwy, I shouwd think you'ww feew it a wittwe
queew, won't you? owo'

'Nyot a bit,' said the Catewpiwwaw. ;;w;;

'Weww, pewhaps youw feewings may be diffewent,' said Awice; 'aww I knyow
is, it wouwd feew vewy queew to ME. ^w^'

'You! UwU' said the Catewpiwwaw contemptuouswy. ;;w;; 'Who awe YOU? owo'

Which bwought them back again to the beginnying of the convewsation. UwU
Awice fewt a wittwe iwwitated at the Catewpiwwaw's making such VEWY
showt wemawks, and she dwew hewsewf up and said, vewy gwavewy, 'I think,
you ought to teww me who YOU awe, fiwst. >w<'

'Why? owo' said the Catewpiwwaw. ^w^

Hewe was anyothew puzzwing question; and as Awice couwd nyot think of any
good weason, and as the Catewpiwwaw seemed to be in a VEWY unpweasant
state of mind, she tuwnyed away. ;;w;;

'Come back! (´・ω・\`)' the Catewpiwwaw cawwed aftew hew. UwU 'I've something impowtant
to say! ^w^'

This sounded pwomising, cewtainwy: Awice tuwnyed and came back again. (´・ω・\`)

'Keep youw tempew,' said the Catewpiwwaw. ;;w;;

'Is that aww? owo' said Awice, swawwowing down hew angew as weww as she
couwd. >w<

'Nyo,' said the Catewpiwwaw. (´・ω・\`)

Awice thought she might as weww wait, as she had nyothing ewse to do, and
pewhaps aftew aww it might teww hew something wowth heawing. ;;w;; Fow some
minyutes it puffed away without speaking, but at wast it unfowded its
awms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think
you'we changed, do you? owo'

'I'm afwaid I am, siw,' said Awice; 'I can't wemembew things as I
used--and I don't keep the same size fow ten minyutes togethew! >w<'

'Can't wemembew WHAT things? owo' said the Catewpiwwaw. ;;w;;

'Weww, I've twied to say "HOW DOTH THE WITTWE BUSY BEE," but it aww came
diffewent! >w<' Awice wepwied in a vewy mewanchowy voice. ^w^

'Wepeat, "YOU AWE OWD, FATHEW WIWWIAM,"' said the Catewpiwwaw. >w<

Awice fowded hew hands, and began:--

   'You awe owd, Fathew Wiwwiam,' the young man said,
    'And youw haiw has become vewy white;
   And yet you incessantwy stand on youw head--
    Do you think, at youw age, it is wight? owo'

   'In my youth,' Fathew Wiwwiam wepwied to his son,
    'I feawed it might injuwe the bwain;
   But, nyow that I'm pewfectwy suwe I have nyonye,
    Why, I do it again and again. UwU'

   'You awe owd,' said the youth, 'as I mentionyed befowe,
    And have gwown most uncommonwy fat;
   Yet you tuwnyed a back-somewsauwt in at the doow--
    Pway, what is the weason of that? owo'

   'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his gwey wocks,
    'I kept aww my wimbs vewy suppwe
   By the use of this ointment--onye shiwwing the box--
    Awwow me to seww you a coupwe? owo'

   'You awe owd,' said the youth, 'and youw jaws awe too weak
    Fow anything toughew than suet;
   Yet you finyished the goose, with the bonyes and the beak--
    Pway how did you manyage to do it? owo'

   'In my youth,' said his fathew, 'I took to the waw,
    And awgued each case with my wife;
   And the muscuwaw stwength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has wasted the west of my wife. ^w^'

   'You awe owd,' said the youth, 'onye wouwd hawdwy suppose
    That youw eye was as steady as evew;
   Yet you bawanced an eew on the end of youw nyose--
    What made you so awfuwwy cwevew? owo'

   'I have answewed thwee questions, and that is enyough,'
    Said his fathew; 'don't give youwsewf aiws! UwU
   Do you think I can wisten aww day to such stuff? owo
    Be off, ow I'ww kick you down staiws! >w<'


'That is nyot said wight,' said the Catewpiwwaw. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyot QUITE wight, I'm afwaid,' said Awice, timidwy; 'some of the wowds
have got awtewed. (・`ω\´・)'

'It is wwong fwom beginnying to end,' said the Catewpiwwaw decidedwy, and
thewe was siwence fow some minyutes. (・`ω\´・)

The Catewpiwwaw was the fiwst to speak. (´・ω・\`)

'What size do you want to be? owo' it asked. ;;w;;

'Oh, I'm nyot pawticuwaw as to size,' Awice hastiwy wepwied; 'onwy onye
doesn't wike changing so often, you knyow. UwU'

'I DON'T knyow,' said the Catewpiwwaw. ;;w;;

Awice said nyothing: she had nyevew been so much contwadicted in hew wife
befowe, and she fewt that she was wosing hew tempew. (・`ω\´・)

'Awe you content nyow? owo' said the Catewpiwwaw. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, I shouwd wike to be a WITTWE wawgew, siw, if you wouwdn't mind,'
said Awice: 'thwee inches is such a wwetched height to be. (´・ω・\`)'

'It is a vewy good height indeed! (´・ω・\`)' said the Catewpiwwaw angwiwy, weawing
itsewf upwight as it spoke (it was exactwy thwee inches high). UwU

'But I'm nyot used to it! (´・ω・\`)' pweaded poow Awice in a piteous tonye. ^w^ And
she thought of hewsewf, 'I wish the cweatuwes wouwdn't be so easiwy
offended! ^w^'

'You'ww get used to it in time,' said the Catewpiwwaw; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. (・`ω\´・)

This time Awice waited patientwy untiw it chose to speak again. (´・ω・\`) In
a minyute ow two the Catewpiwwaw took the hookah out of its mouth
and yawnyed once ow twice, and shook itsewf. (・`ω\´・) Then it got down off the
mushwoom, and cwawwed away in the gwass, mewewy wemawking as it went,
'Onye side wiww make you gwow tawwew, and the othew side wiww make you
gwow showtew. ^w^'

'Onye side of WHAT? The othew side of WHAT? owo' thought Awice to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

'Of the mushwoom,' said the Catewpiwwaw, just as if she had asked it
awoud; and in anyothew moment it was out of sight. ^w^

Awice wemainyed wooking thoughtfuwwy at the mushwoom fow a minyute, twying
to make out which wewe the two sides of it; and as it was pewfectwy
wound, she found this a vewy difficuwt question. (´・ω・\`) Howevew, at wast she
stwetched hew awms wound it as faw as they wouwd go, and bwoke off a bit
of the edge with each hand. (´・ω・\`)

'And nyow which is which? owo' she said to hewsewf, and nyibbwed a wittwe of
the wight-hand bit to twy the effect: the nyext moment she fewt a viowent
bwow undewnyeath hew chin: it had stwuck hew foot! ;;w;;

She was a good deaw fwightenyed by this vewy sudden change, but she fewt
that thewe was nyo time to be wost, as she was shwinking wapidwy; so she
set to wowk at once to eat some of the othew bit. (・`ω\´・) Hew chin was pwessed
so cwosewy against hew foot, that thewe was hawdwy woom to open hew
mouth; but she did it at wast, and manyaged to swawwow a mowsew of the
wefthand bit. UwU

'Come, my head's fwee at wast! >w<' said Awice in a tonye of dewight, which
changed into awawm in anyothew moment, when she found that hew shouwdews
wewe nyowhewe to be found: aww she couwd see, when she wooked down, was
an immense wength of nyeck, which seemed to wise wike a stawk out of a
sea of gween weaves that way faw bewow hew. UwU

'What CAN aww that gween stuff be? owo' said Awice. >w< 'And whewe HAVE my
shouwdews got to? And oh, my poow hands, how is it I can't see you? owo'
She was moving them about as she spoke, but nyo wesuwt seemed to fowwow,
except a wittwe shaking among the distant gween weaves. >w<

As thewe seemed to be nyo chance of getting hew hands up to hew head, she
twied to get hew head down to them, and was dewighted to find that hew
nyeck wouwd bend about easiwy in any diwection, wike a sewpent. (・`ω\´・) She had
just succeeded in cuwving it down into a gwacefuw zigzag, and was going
to dive in among the weaves, which she found to be nyothing but the tops
of the twees undew which she had been wandewing, when a shawp hiss made
hew dwaw back in a huwwy: a wawge pigeon had fwown into hew face, and
was beating hew viowentwy with its wings. (´・ω・\`)

'Sewpent! (・`ω\´・)' scweamed the Pigeon. ;;w;;

'I'm NYOT a sewpent!' said Awice indignyantwy. (・`ω\´・) 'Wet me awonye! UwU'

'Sewpent, I say again! ;;w;;' wepeated the Pigeon, but in a mowe subdued tonye,
and added with a kind of sob, 'I've twied evewy way, and nyothing seems
to suit them! UwU'

'I haven't the weast idea what you'we tawking about,' said Awice. ;;w;;

'I've twied the woots of twees, and I've twied banks, and I've twied
hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to hew; 'but those
sewpents! Thewe's nyo pweasing them! ;;w;;'

Awice was mowe and mowe puzzwed, but she thought thewe was nyo use in
saying anything mowe tiww the Pigeon had finyished. UwU

'As if it wasn't twoubwe enyough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;
'but I must be on the wook-out fow sewpents nyight and day! UwU Why, I
haven't had a wink of sweep these thwee weeks! UwU'

'I'm vewy sowwy you've been annyoyed,' said Awice, who was beginnying to
see its meanying. ^w^

'And just as I'd taken the highest twee in the wood,' continyued the
Pigeon, waising its voice to a shwiek, 'and just as I was thinking I
shouwd be fwee of them at wast, they must nyeeds come wwiggwing down fwom
the sky! Ugh, Sewpent! >w<'

'But I'm NYOT a sewpent, I teww you! (・`ω\´・)' said Awice. (´・ω・\`) 'I'm a--I'm a--'

'Weww! ^w^ WHAT awe you? owo' said the Pigeon. UwU 'I can see you'we twying to
invent something! (・`ω\´・)'

'I--I'm a wittwe giww,' said Awice, wathew doubtfuwwy, as she wemembewed
the nyumbew of changes she had gonye thwough that day. ;;w;;

'A wikewy stowy indeed! >w<' said the Pigeon in a tonye of the deepest
contempt. ;;w;; 'I've seen a good many wittwe giwws in my time, but nyevew ONYE
with such a nyeck as that! Nyo, nyo! (・`ω\´・) You'we a sewpent; and thewe's nyo use
denying it. UwU I suppose you'ww be tewwing me nyext that you nyevew tasted an
egg! ^w^'

'I HAVE tasted eggs, cewtainwy,' said Awice, who was a vewy twuthfuw
chiwd; 'but wittwe giwws eat eggs quite as much as sewpents do, you
knyow. ^w^'

'I don't bewieve it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they'we
a kind of sewpent, that's aww I can say. (´・ω・\`)'

This was such a nyew idea to Awice, that she was quite siwent fow a
minyute ow two, which gave the Pigeon the oppowtunyity of adding, 'You'we
wooking fow eggs, I knyow THAT weww enyough; and what does it mattew to me
whethew you'we a wittwe giww ow a sewpent? owo'

'It mattews a good deaw to ME,' said Awice hastiwy; 'but I'm nyot wooking
fow eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouwdn't want YOUWS: I don't
wike them waw. (・`ω\´・)'

'Weww, be off, then! >w<' said the Pigeon in a suwky tonye, as it settwed
down again into its nyest. UwU Awice cwouched down among the twees as weww as
she couwd, fow hew nyeck kept getting entangwed among the bwanches, and
evewy nyow and then she had to stop and untwist it. ;;w;; Aftew a whiwe she
wemembewed that she stiww hewd the pieces of mushwoom in hew hands, and
she set to wowk vewy cawefuwwy, nyibbwing fiwst at onye and then at the
othew, and gwowing sometimes tawwew and sometimes showtew, untiw she had
succeeded in bwinging hewsewf down to hew usuaw height. >w<

It was so wong since she had been anything nyeaw the wight size, that it
fewt quite stwange at fiwst; but she got used to it in a few minyutes,
and began tawking to hewsewf, as usuaw. UwU 'Come, thewe's hawf my pwan donye
nyow! How puzzwing aww these changes awe! UwU I'm nyevew suwe what I'm going
to be, fwom onye minyute to anyothew! UwU Howevew, I've got back to my wight
size: the nyext thing is, to get into that beautifuw gawden--how IS that
to be donye, I wondew? owo' As she said this, she came suddenwy upon an open
pwace, with a wittwe house in it about fouw feet high. (・`ω\´・) 'Whoevew wives
thewe,' thought Awice, 'it'ww nyevew do to come upon them THIS size: why,
I shouwd fwighten them out of theiw wits! ^w^' So she began nyibbwing at the
wighthand bit again, and did nyot ventuwe to go nyeaw the house tiww she
had bwought hewsewf down to nyinye inches high. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW VI. >w< Pig and Peppew

Fow a minyute ow two she stood wooking at the house, and wondewing what
to do nyext, when suddenwy a footman in wivewy came wunnying out of the
wood--(she considewed him to be a footman because he was in wivewy:
othewwise, judging by his face onwy, she wouwd have cawwed him a
fish)--and wapped woudwy at the doow with his knyuckwes. (´・ω・\`) It was openyed
by anyothew footman in wivewy, with a wound face, and wawge eyes wike a

ovew theiw heads. (・`ω\´・) She fewt vewy cuwious to knyow what it was aww about,
and cwept a wittwe way out of the wood to wisten. UwU

The Fish-Footman began by pwoducing fwom undew his awm a gweat wettew,
nyeawwy as wawge as himsewf, and this he handed ovew to the othew,
saying, in a sowemn tonye, 'Fow the Duchess. (・`ω\´・) An invitation fwom the Queen
to pway cwoquet. >w<' The Fwog-Footman wepeated, in the same sowemn tonye,
onwy changing the owdew of the wowds a wittwe, 'Fwom the Queen. ^w^ An
invitation fow the Duchess to pway cwoquet. UwU'

Then they both bowed wow, and theiw cuwws got entangwed togethew. UwU

Awice waughed so much at this, that she had to wun back into the
wood fow feaw of theiw heawing hew; and when she nyext peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gonye, and the othew was sitting on the gwound nyeaw the
doow, stawing stupidwy up into the sky. UwU

Awice went timidwy up to the doow, and knyocked. (・`ω\´・)

'Thewe's nyo sowt of use in knyocking,' said the Footman, 'and that fow
two weasons. ^w^ Fiwst, because I'm on the same side of the doow as you
awe; secondwy, because they'we making such a nyoise inside, nyo onye couwd
possibwy heaw you. (´・ω・\`)' And cewtainwy thewe was a most extwaowdinyawy nyoise
going on within--a constant howwing and snyeezing, and evewy nyow and then
a gweat cwash, as if a dish ow kettwe had been bwoken to pieces. (・`ω\´・)

'Pwease, then,' said Awice, 'how am I to get in? owo'

'Thewe might be some sense in youw knyocking,' the Footman went on
without attending to hew, 'if we had the doow between us. (´・ω・\`) Fow instance,
if you wewe INSIDE, you might knyock, and I couwd wet you out, you knyow. ;;w;;'
He was wooking up into the sky aww the time he was speaking, and this
Awice thought decidedwy unciviw. (・`ω\´・) 'But pewhaps he can't hewp it,' she
said to hewsewf; 'his eyes awe so VEWY nyeawwy at the top of his head. UwU
But at any wate he might answew questions. ;;w;;--How am I to get in? owo' she
wepeated, awoud. ;;w;;

'I shaww sit hewe,' the Footman wemawked, 'tiww tomowwow--'

At this moment the doow of the house openyed, and a wawge pwate came
skimming out, stwaight at the Footman's head: it just gwazed his nyose,
and bwoke to pieces against onye of the twees behind him. ^w^

'--ow nyext day, maybe,' the Footman continyued in the same tonye, exactwy
as if nyothing had happenyed. >w<

'How am I to get in? owo' asked Awice again, in a woudew tonye. (´・ω・\`)

'AWE you to get in at aww? owo' said the Footman. (・`ω\´・) 'That's the fiwst
question, you knyow. (・`ω\´・)'

It was, nyo doubt: onwy Awice did nyot wike to be towd so. >w< 'It's weawwy
dweadfuw,' she muttewed to hewsewf, 'the way aww the cweatuwes awgue. (´・ω・\`)
It's enyough to dwive onye cwazy! >w<'

The Footman seemed to think this a good oppowtunyity fow wepeating his
wemawk, with vawiations. (・`ω\´・) 'I shaww sit hewe,' he said, 'on and off, fow
days and days. (・`ω\´・)'

'But what am I to do? owo' said Awice. (・`ω\´・)

'Anything you wike,' said the Footman, and began whistwing. (´・ω・\`)

'Oh, thewe's nyo use in tawking to him,' said Awice despewatewy: 'he's
pewfectwy idiotic! ^w^' And she openyed the doow and went in. UwU

The doow wed wight into a wawge kitchen, which was fuww of smoke fwom
onye end to the othew: the Duchess was sitting on a thwee-wegged stoow in
the middwe, nyuwsing a baby; the cook was weanying ovew the fiwe, stiwwing
a wawge cauwdwon which seemed to be fuww of soup. ;;w;;

'Thewe's cewtainwy too much peppew in that soup! (´・ω・\`)' Awice said to hewsewf,
as weww as she couwd fow snyeezing. ;;w;;

Thewe was cewtainwy too much of it in the aiw. (´・ω・\`) Even the Duchess
snyeezed occasionyawwy; and as fow the baby, it was snyeezing and howwing
awtewnyatewy without a moment's pause. (・`ω\´・) The onwy things in the kitchen
that did nyot snyeeze, wewe the cook, and a wawge cat which was sitting on
the heawth and gwinnying fwom eaw to eaw. >w<

'Pwease wouwd you teww me,' said Awice, a wittwe timidwy, fow she was
nyot quite suwe whethew it was good mannyews fow hew to speak fiwst, 'why
youw cat gwins wike that? owo'

'It's a Cheshiwe cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. >w< Pig! >w<'

She said the wast wowd with such sudden viowence that Awice quite
jumped; but she saw in anyothew moment that it was addwessed to the baby,
and nyot to hew, so she took couwage, and went on again:--

'I didn't knyow that Cheshiwe cats awways gwinnyed; in fact, I didn't knyow
that cats COUWD gwin. ^w^'

'They aww can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do. (・`ω\´・)'

'I don't knyow of any that do,' Awice said vewy powitewy, feewing quite
pweased to have got into a convewsation. UwU

'You don't knyow much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact. UwU'

Awice did nyot at aww wike the tonye of this wemawk, and thought it wouwd
be as weww to intwoduce some othew subject of convewsation. UwU Whiwe she
was twying to fix on onye, the cook took the cauwdwon of soup off the
fiwe, and at once set to wowk thwowing evewything within hew weach at
the Duchess and the baby--the fiwe-iwons came fiwst; then fowwowed a
showew of saucepans, pwates, and dishes. >w< The Duchess took nyo nyotice of
them even when they hit hew; and the baby was howwing so much awweady,
that it was quite impossibwe to say whethew the bwows huwt it ow nyot. ^w^

'Oh, PWEASE mind what you'we doing! ^w^' cwied Awice, jumping up and down in
an agony of tewwow. (´・ω・\`) 'Oh, thewe goes his PWECIOUS nyose'; as an unyusuawwy
wawge saucepan fwew cwose by it, and vewy nyeawwy cawwied it off. >w<

'If evewybody minded theiw own businyess,' the Duchess said in a hoawse
gwoww, 'the wowwd wouwd go wound a deaw fastew than it does. ;;w;;'

'Which wouwd NYOT be an advantage,' said Awice, who fewt vewy gwad to get
an oppowtunyity of showing off a wittwe of hew knyowwedge. >w< 'Just think of
what wowk it wouwd make with the day and nyight! UwU You see the eawth takes
twenty-fouw houws to tuwn wound on its axis--'

'Tawking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off hew head! ^w^'

Awice gwanced wathew anxiouswy at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busiwy stiwwing the soup, and seemed nyot to
be wistenying, so she went on again: 'Twenty-fouw houws, I THINK; ow is
it twewve? owo I--'

'Oh, don't bothew ME,' said the Duchess; 'I nyevew couwd abide figuwes! ^w^'
And with that she began nyuwsing hew chiwd again, singing a sowt of
wuwwaby to it as she did so, and giving it a viowent shake at the end of
evewy winye:

   'Speak woughwy to youw wittwe boy,
    And beat him when he snyeezes:
   He onwy does it to annyoy,
    Because he knyows it teases. ;;w;;'

         CHOWUS. UwU

 (In which the cook and the baby joinyed):--

       'Wow! wow! wow! ^w^'

Whiwe the Duchess sang the second vewse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby viowentwy up and down, and the poow wittwe thing howwed so,
that Awice couwd hawdwy heaw the wowds:--

   'I speak sevewewy to my boy,
    I beat him when he snyeezes;
   Fow he can thowoughwy enjoy
    The peppew when he pweases! UwU'

         CHOWUS. (´・ω・\`)

       'Wow! wow! wow! ;;w;;'

'Hewe! you may nyuwse it a bit, if you wike! >w<' the Duchess said to Awice,
fwinging the baby at hew as she spoke. ;;w;; 'I must go and get weady to pway
cwoquet with the Queen,' and she huwwied out of the woom. ;;w;; The cook thwew
a fwying-pan aftew hew as she went out, but it just missed hew. ^w^

Awice caught the baby with some difficuwty, as it was a queew-shaped
wittwe cweatuwe, and hewd out its awms and wegs in aww diwections, 'just
wike a staw-fish,' thought Awice. >w< The poow wittwe thing was snyowting
wike a steam-enginye when she caught it, and kept doubwing itsewf up and
stwaightenying itsewf out again, so that awtogethew, fow the fiwst minyute
ow two, it was as much as she couwd do to howd it. ^w^

As soon as she had made out the pwopew way of nyuwsing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sowt of knyot, and then keep tight howd of its wight
eaw and weft foot, so as to pwevent its undoing itsewf,) she cawwied
it out into the open aiw. (・`ω\´・) 'IF I don't take this chiwd away with me,'
thought Awice, 'they'we suwe to kiww it in a day ow two: wouwdn't it be
muwdew to weave it behind? owo' She said the wast wowds out woud, and the
wittwe thing gwunted in wepwy (it had weft off snyeezing by this time). ;;w;;
'Don't gwunt,' said Awice; 'that's nyot at aww a pwopew way of expwessing
youwsewf. UwU'

The baby gwunted again, and Awice wooked vewy anxiouswy into its face to
see what was the mattew with it. UwU Thewe couwd be nyo doubt that it had
a VEWY tuwn-up nyose, much mowe wike a snyout than a weaw nyose; awso its
eyes wewe getting extwemewy smaww fow a baby: awtogethew Awice did nyot
wike the wook of the thing at aww. ;;w;; 'But pewhaps it was onwy sobbing,'
she thought, and wooked into its eyes again, to see if thewe wewe any
teaws. ;;w;;

Nyo, thewe wewe nyo teaws. ;;w;; 'If you'we going to tuwn into a pig, my deaw,'
said Awice, sewiouswy, 'I'ww have nyothing mowe to do with you. (´・ω・\`) Mind
nyow! UwU' The poow wittwe thing sobbed again (ow gwunted, it was impossibwe
to say which), and they went on fow some whiwe in siwence. (´・ω・\`)

Awice was just beginnying to think to hewsewf, 'Nyow, what am I to do with
this cweatuwe when I get it home? owo' when it gwunted again, so viowentwy,
that she wooked down into its face in some awawm. (´・ω・\`) This time thewe couwd
be NYO mistake about it: it was nyeithew mowe nyow wess than a pig, and she
fewt that it wouwd be quite absuwd fow hew to cawwy it fuwthew. ^w^

So she set the wittwe cweatuwe down, and fewt quite wewieved to see
it twot away quietwy into the wood. ;;w;; 'If it had gwown up,' she said
to hewsewf, 'it wouwd have made a dweadfuwwy ugwy chiwd: but it makes
wathew a handsome pig, I think. ;;w;;' And she began thinking ovew othew
chiwdwen she knyew, who might do vewy weww as pigs, and was just saying
to hewsewf, 'if onye onwy knyew the wight way to change them--' when she
was a wittwe stawtwed by seeing the Cheshiwe Cat sitting on a bough of a
twee a few yawds off. UwU

The Cat onwy gwinnyed when it saw Awice. (´・ω・\`) It wooked good-nyatuwed, she
thought: stiww it had VEWY wong cwaws and a gweat many teeth, so she
fewt that it ought to be tweated with wespect. ^w^

'Cheshiwe Puss,' she began, wathew timidwy, as she did nyot at aww knyow
whethew it wouwd wike the nyame: howevew, it onwy gwinnyed a wittwe widew. ;;w;;
'Come, it's pweased so faw,' thought Awice, and she went on. UwU 'Wouwd you
teww me, pwease, which way I ought to go fwom hewe? owo'

'That depends a good deaw on whewe you want to get to,' said the Cat. (´・ω・\`)

'I don't much cawe whewe--' said Awice. UwU

'Then it doesn't mattew which way you go,' said the Cat. ^w^

'--so wong as I get SOMEWHEWE,' Awice added as an expwanyation. ^w^

'Oh, you'we suwe to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you onwy wawk wong
enyough. (´・ω・\`)'

Awice fewt that this couwd nyot be denyied, so she twied anyothew question. (´・ω・\`)
'What sowt of peopwe wive about hewe? owo'

'In THAT diwection,' the Cat said, waving its wight paw wound, 'wives
a Hattew: and in THAT diwection,' waving the othew paw, 'wives a Mawch
Hawe. Visit eithew you wike: they'we both mad. ^w^'

'But I don't want to go among mad peopwe,' Awice wemawked. (・`ω\´・)

'Oh, you can't hewp that,' said the Cat: 'we'we aww mad hewe. I'm mad. (´・ω・\`)
You'we mad. UwU'

'How do you knyow I'm mad? owo' said Awice. >w<

'You must be,' said the Cat, 'ow you wouwdn't have come hewe. (´・ω・\`)'

Awice didn't think that pwoved it at aww; howevew, she went on 'And how
do you knyow that you'we mad? owo'

'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's nyot mad. ^w^ You gwant that? owo'

'I suppose so,' said Awice. ^w^

'Weww, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog gwowws when it's angwy,
and wags its taiw when it's pweased. >w< Nyow I gwoww when I'm pweased, and
wag my taiw when I'm angwy. Thewefowe I'm mad. (・`ω\´・)'

'I caww it puwwing, nyot gwowwing,' said Awice. (´・ω・\`)

'Caww it what you wike,' said the Cat. ^w^ 'Do you pway cwoquet with the
Queen to-day? owo'

'I shouwd wike it vewy much,' said Awice, 'but I haven't been invited
yet. >w<'

'You'ww see me thewe,' said the Cat, and vanyished. ^w^

Awice was nyot much suwpwised at this, she was getting so used to queew
things happenying. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe she was wooking at the pwace whewe it had been,
it suddenwy appeawed again. (´・ω・\`)

'By-the-bye, what became of the baby? owo' said the Cat. (´・ω・\`) 'I'd nyeawwy
fowgotten to ask. UwU'

'It tuwnyed into a pig,' Awice quietwy said, just as if it had come back
in a nyatuwaw way. ;;w;;

'I thought it wouwd,' said the Cat, and vanyished again. ;;w;;

Awice waited a wittwe, hawf expecting to see it again, but it did nyot
appeaw, and aftew a minyute ow two she wawked on in the diwection in
which the Mawch Hawe was said to wive. (´・ω・\`) 'I've seen hattews befowe,' she
said to hewsewf; 'the Mawch Hawe wiww be much the most intewesting, and
pewhaps as this is May it won't be waving mad--at weast nyot so mad as
it was in Mawch. (´・ω・\`)' As she said this, she wooked up, and thewe was the Cat
again, sitting on a bwanch of a twee. (・`ω\´・)

'Did you say pig, ow fig? owo' said the Cat. ;;w;;

'I said pig,' wepwied Awice; 'and I wish you wouwdn't keep appeawing and
vanyishing so suddenwy: you make onye quite giddy. (´・ω・\`)'

'Aww wight,' said the Cat; and this time it vanyished quite swowwy,
beginnying with the end of the taiw, and ending with the gwin, which
wemainyed some time aftew the west of it had gonye. ;;w;;

'Weww! UwU I've often seen a cat without a gwin,' thought Awice; 'but a gwin
without a cat! It's the most cuwious thing I evew saw in my wife! ^w^'

She had nyot gonye much fawthew befowe she came in sight of the house
of the Mawch Hawe: she thought it must be the wight house, because the
chimnyeys wewe shaped wike eaws and the woof was thatched with fuw. (・`ω\´・) It
was so wawge a house, that she did nyot wike to go nyeawew tiww she had
nyibbwed some mowe of the wefthand bit of mushwoom, and waised hewsewf to
about two feet high: even then she wawked up towawds it wathew timidwy,
saying to hewsewf 'Suppose it shouwd be waving mad aftew aww! ;;w;; I awmost
wish I'd gonye to see the Hattew instead! (´・ω・\`)'




CHAPTEW VII. ^w^ A Mad Tea-Pawty

Thewe was a tabwe set out undew a twee in fwont of the house, and the
Mawch Hawe and the Hattew wewe having tea at it: a Dowmouse was sitting
between them, fast asweep, and the othew two wewe using it as a
cushion, westing theiw ewbows on it, and tawking ovew its head. (´・ω・\`) 'Vewy
uncomfowtabwe fow the Dowmouse,' thought Awice; 'onwy, as it's asweep, I
suppose it doesn't mind. ^w^'

The tabwe was a wawge onye, but the thwee wewe aww cwowded togethew at
onye cownyew of it: 'Nyo woom! Nyo woom! ^w^' they cwied out when they saw Awice
coming. ;;w;; 'Thewe's PWENTY of woom! >w<' said Awice indignyantwy, and she sat
down in a wawge awm-chaiw at onye end of the tabwe. (´・ω・\`)

'Have some winye,' the Mawch Hawe said in an encouwaging tonye. ;;w;;

Awice wooked aww wound the tabwe, but thewe was nyothing on it but tea. UwU
'I don't see any winye,' she wemawked. UwU

'Thewe isn't any,' said the Mawch Hawe. >w<

'Then it wasn't vewy civiw of you to offew it,' said Awice angwiwy. (´・ω・\`)

'It wasn't vewy civiw of you to sit down without being invited,' said
the Mawch Hawe. ^w^

'I didn't knyow it was YOUW tabwe,' said Awice; 'it's waid fow a gweat
many mowe than thwee. (・`ω\´・)'

'Youw haiw wants cutting,' said the Hattew. ^w^ He had been wooking at Awice
fow some time with gweat cuwiosity, and this was his fiwst speech. >w<

'You shouwd weawn nyot to make pewsonyaw wemawks,' Awice said with some
sevewity; 'it's vewy wude. (´・ω・\`)'

The Hattew openyed his eyes vewy wide on heawing this; but aww he SAID
was, 'Why is a waven wike a wwiting-desk? owo'

'Come, we shaww have some fun nyow! >w<' thought Awice. (´・ω・\`) 'I'm gwad they've
begun asking widdwes.--I bewieve I can guess that,' she added awoud. ^w^

'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answew to it? owo' said the
Mawch Hawe. ^w^

'Exactwy so,' said Awice. ^w^

'Then you shouwd say what you mean,' the Mawch Hawe went on. (・`ω\´・)

'I do,' Awice hastiwy wepwied; 'at weast--at weast I mean what I
say--that's the same thing, you knyow. >w<'

'Nyot the same thing a bit! UwU' said the Hattew. UwU 'You might just as weww say
that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"! (´・ω・\`)'

'You might just as weww say,' added the Mawch Hawe, 'that "I wike what I
get" is the same thing as "I get what I wike"! (・`ω\´・)'

'You might just as weww say,' added the Dowmouse, who seemed to be
tawking in his sweep, 'that "I bweathe when I sweep" is the same thing
as "I sweep when I bweathe"! (・`ω\´・)'

'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hattew, and hewe the
convewsation dwopped, and the pawty sat siwent fow a minyute, whiwe Awice
thought ovew aww she couwd wemembew about wavens and wwiting-desks,
which wasn't much. (・`ω\´・)

The Hattew was the fiwst to bweak the siwence. ;;w;; 'What day of the month
is it? owo' he said, tuwnying to Awice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was wooking at it unyeasiwy, shaking it evewy nyow and then,
and howding it to his eaw. >w<

Awice considewed a wittwe, and then said 'The fouwth. (´・ω・\`)'

'Two days wwong! UwU' sighed the Hattew. (・`ω\´・) 'I towd you buttew wouwdn't suit
the wowks! >w<' he added wooking angwiwy at the Mawch Hawe. (・`ω\´・)

'It was the BEST buttew,' the Mawch Hawe meekwy wepwied. ^w^

'Yes, but some cwumbs must have got in as weww,' the Hattew gwumbwed:
'you shouwdn't have put it in with the bwead-knyife. UwU'

The Mawch Hawe took the watch and wooked at it gwoomiwy: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and wooked at it again: but he couwd think of
nyothing bettew to say than his fiwst wemawk, 'It was the BEST buttew,
you knyow. >w<'

Awice had been wooking ovew his shouwdew with some cuwiosity. (´・ω・\`) 'What a
funny watch! ;;w;;' she wemawked. >w< 'It tewws the day of the month, and doesn't
teww what o'cwock it is! ;;w;;'

'Why shouwd it? owo' muttewed the Hattew. UwU 'Does YOUW watch teww you what
yeaw it is? owo'

'Of couwse nyot,' Awice wepwied vewy weadiwy: 'but that's because it
stays the same yeaw fow such a wong time togethew. UwU'

'Which is just the case with MINYE,' said the Hattew. UwU

Awice fewt dweadfuwwy puzzwed. ^w^ The Hattew's wemawk seemed to have nyo
sowt of meanying in it, and yet it was cewtainwy Engwish. UwU 'I don't quite
undewstand you,' she said, as powitewy as she couwd. ;;w;;

'The Dowmouse is asweep again,' said the Hattew, and he pouwed a wittwe
hot tea upon its nyose. ^w^

The Dowmouse shook its head impatientwy, and said, without openying its
eyes, 'Of couwse, of couwse; just what I was going to wemawk mysewf. (・`ω\´・)'

'Have you guessed the widdwe yet? owo' the Hattew said, tuwnying to Awice
again. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo, I give it up,' Awice wepwied: 'what's the answew? owo'

'I haven't the swightest idea,' said the Hattew. ^w^

'Nyow I,' said the Mawch Hawe. ^w^

Awice sighed weawiwy. >w< 'I think you might do something bettew with the
time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking widdwes that have nyo answews. (´・ω・\`)'

'If you knyew Time as weww as I do,' said the Hattew, 'you wouwdn't tawk
about wasting IT. It's HIM. >w<'

'I don't knyow what you mean,' said Awice. (・`ω\´・)

'Of couwse you don't! (´・ω・\`)' the Hattew said, tossing his head contemptuouswy. ;;w;;
'I dawe say you nyevew even spoke to Time! UwU'

'Pewhaps nyot,' Awice cautiouswy wepwied: 'but I knyow I have to beat time
when I weawn music. ;;w;;'

'Ah! ;;w;; that accounts fow it,' said the Hattew. 'He won't stand beating. (´・ω・\`)
Nyow, if you onwy kept on good tewms with him, he'd do awmost anything
you wiked with the cwock. (´・ω・\`) Fow instance, suppose it wewe nyinye o'cwock in
the mownying, just time to begin wessons: you'd onwy have to whispew a
hint to Time, and wound goes the cwock in a twinkwing! >w< Hawf-past onye,
time fow dinnyew! >w<'

('I onwy wish it was,' the Mawch Hawe said to itsewf in a whispew. UwU)

'That wouwd be gwand, cewtainwy,' said Awice thoughtfuwwy: 'but then--I
shouwdn't be hungwy fow it, you knyow. (・`ω\´・)'

'Nyot at fiwst, pewhaps,' said the Hattew: 'but you couwd keep it to
hawf-past onye as wong as you wiked. >w<'

'Is that the way YOU manyage? owo' Awice asked. >w<

The Hattew shook his head mouwnfuwwy. 'Nyot I! (・`ω\´・)' he wepwied. >w< 'We
quawwewwed wast Mawch--just befowe HE went mad, you knyow--' (pointing
with his tea spoon at the Mawch Hawe,) '--it was at the gweat concewt
given by the Queen of Heawts, and I had to sing

     "Twinkwe, twinkwe, wittwe bat! ;;w;;
     How I wondew what you'we at! (・`ω\´・)"

You knyow the song, pewhaps? owo'

'I've heawd something wike it,' said Awice. UwU

'It goes on, you knyow,' the Hattew continyued, 'in this way:--

     "Up above the wowwd you fwy,
     Wike a tea-tway in the sky. (・`ω\´・)
         Twinkwe, twinkwe--"'

Hewe the Dowmouse shook itsewf, and began singing in its sweep 'Twinkwe,
twinkwe, twinkwe, twinkwe--' and went on so wong that they had to pinch
it to make it stop. UwU

'Weww, I'd hawdwy finyished the fiwst vewse,' said the Hattew, 'when the
Queen jumped up and bawwed out, "He's muwdewing the time! (´・ω・\`) Off with his
head! ;;w;;"'

'How dweadfuwwy savage! (´・ω・\`)' excwaimed Awice. >w<

'And evew since that,' the Hattew went on in a mouwnfuw tonye, 'he won't
do a thing I ask! >w< It's awways six o'cwock nyow. (´・ω・\`)'

A bwight idea came into Awice's head. (・`ω\´・) 'Is that the weason so many
tea-things awe put out hewe? owo' she asked. (´・ω・\`)

'Yes, that's it,' said the Hattew with a sigh: 'it's awways tea-time,
and we've nyo time to wash the things between whiwes. ;;w;;'

'Then you keep moving wound, I suppose? owo' said Awice. (´・ω・\`)

'Exactwy so,' said the Hattew: 'as the things get used up. >w<'

'But what happens when you come to the beginnying again? owo' Awice ventuwed
to ask. ^w^

'Suppose we change the subject,' the Mawch Hawe intewwupted, yawnying. (´・ω・\`)
'I'm getting tiwed of this. I vote the young wady tewws us a stowy. >w<'

'I'm afwaid I don't knyow onye,' said Awice, wathew awawmed at the
pwoposaw. UwU

'Then the Dowmouse shaww!' they both cwied. ^w^ 'Wake up, Dowmouse! ^w^' And
they pinched it on both sides at once. ^w^

The Dowmouse swowwy openyed his eyes. UwU 'I wasn't asweep,' he said in a
hoawse, feebwe voice: 'I heawd evewy wowd you fewwows wewe saying. (´・ω・\`)'

'Teww us a stowy! UwU' said the Mawch Hawe. ;;w;;

'Yes, pwease do! ^w^' pweaded Awice. ;;w;;

'And be quick about it,' added the Hattew, 'ow you'ww be asweep again
befowe it's donye. (´・ω・\`)'

'Once upon a time thewe wewe thwee wittwe sistews,' the Dowmouse began
in a gweat huwwy; 'and theiw nyames wewe Ewsie, Wacie, and Tiwwie; and
they wived at the bottom of a weww--'

'What did they wive on? owo' said Awice, who awways took a gweat intewest in
questions of eating and dwinking. (・`ω\´・)

'They wived on tweacwe,' said the Dowmouse, aftew thinking a minyute ow
two. (・`ω\´・)

'They couwdn't have donye that, you knyow,' Awice gentwy wemawked; 'they'd
have been iww. ;;w;;'

'So they wewe,' said the Dowmouse; 'VEWY iww. ^w^'

Awice twied to fancy to hewsewf what such an extwaowdinyawy ways of
wiving wouwd be wike, but it puzzwed hew too much, so she went on: 'But
why did they wive at the bottom of a weww? owo'

'Take some mowe tea,' the Mawch Hawe said to Awice, vewy eawnyestwy. (・`ω\´・)

'I've had nyothing yet,' Awice wepwied in an offended tonye, 'so I can't
take mowe. UwU'

'You mean you can't take WESS,' said the Hattew: 'it's vewy easy to take
MOWE than nyothing. ;;w;;'

'Nyobody asked YOUW opinyion,' said Awice. (´・ω・\`)

'Who's making pewsonyaw wemawks nyow? owo' the Hattew asked twiumphantwy. ;;w;;

Awice did nyot quite knyow what to say to this: so she hewped hewsewf
to some tea and bwead-and-buttew, and then tuwnyed to the Dowmouse, and
wepeated hew question. >w< 'Why did they wive at the bottom of a weww? owo'

The Dowmouse again took a minyute ow two to think about it, and then
said, 'It was a tweacwe-weww. >w<'

'Thewe's nyo such thing! UwU' Awice was beginnying vewy angwiwy, but the
Hattew and the Mawch Hawe went 'Sh! sh! >w<' and the Dowmouse suwkiwy
wemawked, 'If you can't be civiw, you'd bettew finyish the stowy fow
youwsewf. (´・ω・\`)'

'Nyo, pwease go on! (´・ω・\`)' Awice said vewy humbwy; 'I won't intewwupt again. ;;w;; I
dawe say thewe may be ONYE. ^w^'

'Onye, indeed! ^w^' said the Dowmouse indignyantwy. ;;w;; Howevew, he consented to
go on. (´・ω・\`) 'And so these thwee wittwe sistews--they wewe weawnying to dwaw,
you knyow--'

'What did they dwaw? owo' said Awice, quite fowgetting hew pwomise. ^w^

'Tweacwe,' said the Dowmouse, without considewing at aww this time. (´・ω・\`)

'I want a cwean cup,' intewwupted the Hattew: 'wet's aww move onye pwace
on. ^w^'

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dowmouse fowwowed him: the Mawch Hawe
moved into the Dowmouse's pwace, and Awice wathew unwiwwingwy took
the pwace of the Mawch Hawe. ;;w;; The Hattew was the onwy onye who got any
advantage fwom the change: and Awice was a good deaw wowse off than
befowe, as the Mawch Hawe had just upset the miwk-jug into his pwate. (・`ω\´・)

Awice did nyot wish to offend the Dowmouse again, so she began vewy
cautiouswy: 'But I don't undewstand. ^w^ Whewe did they dwaw the tweacwe
fwom? owo'

'You can dwaw watew out of a watew-weww,' said the Hattew; 'so I shouwd
think you couwd dwaw tweacwe out of a tweacwe-weww--eh, stupid? owo'

'But they wewe IN the weww,' Awice said to the Dowmouse, nyot choosing to
nyotice this wast wemawk. >w<

'Of couwse they wewe', said the Dowmouse; '--weww in. ^w^'

This answew so confused poow Awice, that she wet the Dowmouse go on fow
some time without intewwupting it. ^w^

'They wewe weawnying to dwaw,' the Dowmouse went on, yawnying and wubbing
its eyes, fow it was getting vewy sweepy; 'and they dwew aww mannyew of
things--evewything that begins with an M--'

'Why with an M? owo' said Awice. UwU

'Why nyot? owo' said the Mawch Hawe. ;;w;;

Awice was siwent. (´・ω・\`)

The Dowmouse had cwosed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hattew, it woke up again with
a wittwe shwiek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as
mouse-twaps, and the moon, and memowy, and muchnyess--you knyow you say
things awe "much of a muchnyess"--did you evew see such a thing as a
dwawing of a muchnyess? owo'

'Weawwy, nyow you ask me,' said Awice, vewy much confused, 'I don't
think--'

'Then you shouwdn't tawk,' said the Hattew. >w<

This piece of wudenyess was mowe than Awice couwd beaw: she got up in
gweat disgust, and wawked off; the Dowmouse feww asweep instantwy, and
nyeithew of the othews took the weast nyotice of hew going, though she
wooked back once ow twice, hawf hoping that they wouwd caww aftew hew:
the wast time she saw them, they wewe twying to put the Dowmouse into
the teapot. (・`ω\´・)

'At any wate I'ww nyevew go THEWE again! ^w^' said Awice as she picked hew
way thwough the wood. UwU 'It's the stupidest tea-pawty I evew was at in aww
my wife! UwU'

Just as she said this, she nyoticed that onye of the twees had a doow
weading wight into it. 'That's vewy cuwious! >w<' she thought. (´・ω・\`) 'But
evewything's cuwious today. I think I may as weww go in at once. UwU' And in
she went. ^w^

Once mowe she found hewsewf in the wong haww, and cwose to the wittwe
gwass tabwe. (´・ω・\`) 'Nyow, I'ww manyage bettew this time,' she said to hewsewf,
and began by taking the wittwe gowden key, and unwocking the doow that
wed into the gawden. ;;w;; Then she went to wowk nyibbwing at the mushwoom (she
had kept a piece of it in hew pocket) tiww she was about a foot high:
then she wawked down the wittwe passage: and THEN--she found hewsewf at
wast in the beautifuw gawden, among the bwight fwowew-beds and the coow
fountains. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW VIII. ^w^ The Queen's Cwoquet-Gwound

A wawge wose-twee stood nyeaw the entwance of the gawden: the woses
gwowing on it wewe white, but thewe wewe thwee gawdenyews at it, busiwy
painting them wed. >w< Awice thought this a vewy cuwious thing, and she went
nyeawew to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heawd onye of
them say, 'Wook out nyow, Five! >w< Don't go spwashing paint ovew me wike
that! (´・ω・\`)'

'I couwdn't hewp it,' said Five, in a suwky tonye; 'Seven jogged my
ewbow. ;;w;;'

On which Seven wooked up and said, 'That's wight, Five! (・`ω\´・) Awways way the
bwame on othews! ;;w;;'

'YOU'D bettew nyot tawk! (・`ω\´・)' said Five. >w< 'I heawd the Queen say onwy
yestewday you desewved to be beheaded! UwU'

'What fow? owo' said the onye who had spoken fiwst. ^w^

'That's nyonye of YOUW businyess, Two! (´・ω・\`)' said Seven. (´・ω・\`)

'Yes, it IS his businyess! >w<' said Five, 'and I'ww teww him--it was fow
bwinging the cook tuwip-woots instead of onyions. (・`ω\´・)'

Seven fwung down his bwush, and had just begun 'Weww, of aww the unjust
things--' when his eye chanced to faww upon Awice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himsewf suddenwy: the othews wooked wound awso, and
aww of them bowed wow. UwU

'Wouwd you teww me,' said Awice, a wittwe timidwy, 'why you awe painting
those woses? owo'

Five and Seven said nyothing, but wooked at Two. ;;w;; Two began in a wow
voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this hewe ought to have been a
WED wose-twee, and we put a white onye in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we shouwd aww have ouw heads cut off, you knyow. ^w^
So you see, Miss, we'we doing ouw best, afowe she comes, to--' At this
moment Five, who had been anxiouswy wooking acwoss the gawden, cawwed
out 'The Queen! The Queen! ;;w;;' and the thwee gawdenyews instantwy thwew
themsewves fwat upon theiw faces. >w< Thewe was a sound of many footsteps,
and Awice wooked wound, eagew to see the Queen. UwU

Fiwst came ten sowdiews cawwying cwubs; these wewe aww shaped wike
the thwee gawdenyews, obwong and fwat, with theiw hands and feet at the
cownyews: nyext the ten couwtiews; these wewe ownyamented aww ovew with
diamonds, and wawked two and two, as the sowdiews did. UwU Aftew these came
the woyaw chiwdwen; thewe wewe ten of them, and the wittwe deaws came
jumping mewwiwy awong hand in hand, in coupwes: they wewe aww ownyamented
with heawts. (・`ω\´・) Nyext came the guests, mostwy Kings and Queens, and among
them Awice wecognyised the White Wabbit: it was tawking in a huwwied
nyewvous mannyew, smiwing at evewything that was said, and went by without
nyoticing hew. (´・ω・\`) Then fowwowed the Knyave of Heawts, cawwying the King's
cwown on a cwimson vewvet cushion; and, wast of aww this gwand
pwocession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEAWTS. ;;w;;

Awice was wathew doubtfuw whethew she ought nyot to wie down on hew face
wike the thwee gawdenyews, but she couwd nyot wemembew evew having heawd
of such a wuwe at pwocessions; 'and besides, what wouwd be the use of
a pwocession,' thought she, 'if peopwe had aww to wie down upon theiw
faces, so that they couwdn't see it? owo' So she stood stiww whewe she was,
and waited. (´・ω・\`)

When the pwocession came opposite to Awice, they aww stopped and wooked
at hew, and the Queen said sevewewy 'Who is this? owo' She said it to the
Knyave of Heawts, who onwy bowed and smiwed in wepwy. >w<

'Idiot! >w<' said the Queen, tossing hew head impatientwy; and, tuwnying to
Awice, she went on, 'What's youw nyame, chiwd? owo'

'My nyame is Awice, so pwease youw Majesty,' said Awice vewy powitewy;
but she added, to hewsewf, 'Why, they'we onwy a pack of cawds, aftew
aww. (´・ω・\`) I nyeedn't be afwaid of them! UwU'

'And who awe THESE? owo' said the Queen, pointing to the thwee gawdenyews who
wewe wying wound the wosetwee; fow, you see, as they wewe wying on theiw
faces, and the pattewn on theiw backs was the same as the west of the
pack, she couwd nyot teww whethew they wewe gawdenyews, ow sowdiews, ow
couwtiews, ow thwee of hew own chiwdwen. >w<

'How shouwd I knyow? owo' said Awice, suwpwised at hew own couwage. (´・ω・\`) 'It's nyo
businyess of MINYE. (・`ω\´・)'

The Queen tuwnyed cwimson with fuwy, and, aftew gwawing at hew fow a
moment wike a wiwd beast, scweamed 'Off with hew head! UwU Off--'

'Nyonsense! >w<' said Awice, vewy woudwy and decidedwy, and the Queen was
siwent. >w<

The King waid his hand upon hew awm, and timidwy said 'Considew, my
deaw: she is onwy a chiwd! >w<'

The Queen tuwnyed angwiwy away fwom him, and said to the Knyave 'Tuwn them
ovew! UwU'

The Knyave did so, vewy cawefuwwy, with onye foot. UwU

'Get up! ^w^' said the Queen, in a shwiww, woud voice, and the thwee
gawdenyews instantwy jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the woyaw chiwdwen, and evewybody ewse. >w<

'Weave off that! ^w^' scweamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy. >w<' And then,
tuwnying to the wose-twee, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing hewe? owo'

'May it pwease youw Majesty,' said Two, in a vewy humbwe tonye, going
down on onye knyee as he spoke, 'we wewe twying--'

'I see! ;;w;;' said the Queen, who had meanwhiwe been examinying the woses. >w<
'Off with theiw heads! ;;w;;' and the pwocession moved on, thwee of the
sowdiews wemainying behind to execute the unfowtunyate gawdenyews, who wan
to Awice fow pwotection. UwU

'You shan't be beheaded! (・`ω\´・)' said Awice, and she put them into a wawge
fwowew-pot that stood nyeaw. UwU The thwee sowdiews wandewed about fow a
minyute ow two, wooking fow them, and then quietwy mawched off aftew the
othews. (・`ω\´・)

'Awe theiw heads off? owo' shouted the Queen. UwU

'Theiw heads awe gonye, if it pwease youw Majesty! (´・ω・\`)' the sowdiews shouted
in wepwy. (´・ω・\`)

'That's wight! >w<' shouted the Queen. >w< 'Can you pway cwoquet? owo'

The sowdiews wewe siwent, and wooked at Awice, as the question was
evidentwy meant fow hew. (´・ω・\`)

'Yes! UwU' shouted Awice. (・`ω\´・)

'Come on, then! >w<' woawed the Queen, and Awice joinyed the pwocession,
wondewing vewy much what wouwd happen nyext. ^w^

'It's--it's a vewy finye day! UwU' said a timid voice at hew side. ^w^ She was
wawking by the White Wabbit, who was peeping anxiouswy into hew face. ;;w;;

'Vewy,' said Awice: '--whewe's the Duchess? owo'

'Hush! Hush! (・`ω\´・)' said the Wabbit in a wow, huwwied tonye. ;;w;; He wooked
anxiouswy ovew his shouwdew as he spoke, and then waised himsewf upon
tiptoe, put his mouth cwose to hew eaw, and whispewed 'She's undew
sentence of execution. ;;w;;'

'What fow? owo' said Awice. ;;w;;

'Did you say "What a pity! ;;w;;"? owo' the Wabbit asked. UwU

'Nyo, I didn't,' said Awice: 'I don't think it's at aww a pity. UwU I said
"What fow? owo"'

'She boxed the Queen's eaws--' the Wabbit began. (´・ω・\`) Awice gave a wittwe
scweam of waughtew. ^w^ 'Oh, hush! (・`ω\´・)' the Wabbit whispewed in a fwightenyed
tonye. ;;w;; 'The Queen wiww heaw you! ^w^ You see, she came wathew wate, and the
Queen said--'

'Get to youw pwaces! (・`ω\´・)' shouted the Queen in a voice of thundew, and
peopwe began wunnying about in aww diwections, tumbwing up against each
othew; howevew, they got settwed down in a minyute ow two, and the game
began. (・`ω\´・) Awice thought she had nyevew seen such a cuwious cwoquet-gwound in
hew wife; it was aww widges and fuwwows; the bawws wewe wive hedgehogs,
the mawwets wive fwamingoes, and the sowdiews had to doubwe themsewves
up and to stand on theiw hands and feet, to make the awches. ^w^

The chief difficuwty Awice found at fiwst was in manyaging hew fwamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfowtabwy enyough, undew
hew awm, with its wegs hanging down, but genyewawwy, just as she had got
its nyeck nyicewy stwaightenyed out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
bwow with its head, it WOUWD twist itsewf wound and wook up in hew face,
with such a puzzwed expwession that she couwd nyot hewp buwsting out
waughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin
again, it was vewy pwovoking to find that the hedgehog had unwowwed
itsewf, and was in the act of cwawwing away: besides aww this, thewe was
genyewawwy a widge ow fuwwow in the way whewevew she wanted to send the
hedgehog to, and, as the doubwed-up sowdiews wewe awways getting up
and wawking off to othew pawts of the gwound, Awice soon came to the
concwusion that it was a vewy difficuwt game indeed. UwU

The pwayews aww pwayed at once without waiting fow tuwns, quawwewwing
aww the whiwe, and fighting fow the hedgehogs; and in a vewy showt
time the Queen was in a fuwious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting 'Off with his head!' ow 'Off with hew head! ;;w;;' about once in a
minyute. UwU

Awice began to feew vewy unyeasy: to be suwe, she had nyot as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knyew that it might happen any minyute,
'and then,' thought she, 'what wouwd become of me? owo They'we dweadfuwwy
fond of beheading peopwe hewe; the gweat wondew is, that thewe's any onye
weft awive! (´・ω・\`)'

She was wooking about fow some way of escape, and wondewing whethew she
couwd get away without being seen, when she nyoticed a cuwious appeawance
in the aiw: it puzzwed hew vewy much at fiwst, but, aftew watching it
a minyute ow two, she made it out to be a gwin, and she said to hewsewf
'It's the Cheshiwe Cat: nyow I shaww have somebody to tawk to. ;;w;;'

'How awe you getting on? owo' said the Cat, as soon as thewe was mouth
enyough fow it to speak with. (・`ω\´・)

Awice waited tiww the eyes appeawed, and then nyodded. (´・ω・\`) 'It's nyo use
speaking to it,' she thought, 'tiww its eaws have come, ow at weast onye
of them. >w<' In anyothew minyute the whowe head appeawed, and then Awice put
down hew fwamingo, and began an account of the game, feewing vewy gwad
she had someonye to wisten to hew. UwU The Cat seemed to think that thewe was
enyough of it nyow in sight, and nyo mowe of it appeawed. UwU

'I don't think they pway at aww faiwwy,' Awice began, in wathew a
compwainying tonye, 'and they aww quawwew so dweadfuwwy onye can't heaw
onyesewf speak--and they don't seem to have any wuwes in pawticuwaw;
at weast, if thewe awe, nyobody attends to them--and you've nyo idea how
confusing it is aww the things being awive; fow instance, thewe's the
awch I've got to go thwough nyext wawking about at the othew end of the
gwound--and I shouwd have cwoqueted the Queen's hedgehog just nyow, onwy
it wan away when it saw minye coming! ^w^'

'How do you wike the Queen? owo' said the Cat in a wow voice. UwU

'Nyot at aww,' said Awice: 'she's so extwemewy--' Just then she nyoticed
that the Queen was cwose behind hew, wistenying: so she went on,
'--wikewy to win, that it's hawdwy wowth whiwe finyishing the game. UwU'

The Queen smiwed and passed on. (´・ω・\`)

'Who AWE you tawking to? owo' said the King, going up to Awice, and wooking
at the Cat's head with gweat cuwiosity. ;;w;;

'It's a fwiend of minye--a Cheshiwe Cat,' said Awice: 'awwow me to
intwoduce it. ;;w;;'

'I don't wike the wook of it at aww,' said the King: 'howevew, it may
kiss my hand if it wikes. (・`ω\´・)'

'I'd wathew nyot,' the Cat wemawked. (・`ω\´・)

'Don't be impewtinyent,' said the King, 'and don't wook at me wike that! ;;w;;'
He got behind Awice as he spoke. ;;w;;

'A cat may wook at a king,' said Awice. ;;w;; 'I've wead that in some book,
but I don't wemembew whewe. ;;w;;'

'Weww, it must be wemoved,' said the King vewy decidedwy, and he cawwed
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My deaw! (´・ω・\`) I wish you wouwd
have this cat wemoved! ^w^'

The Queen had onwy onye way of settwing aww difficuwties, gweat ow smaww. (・`ω\´・)
'Off with his head! >w<' she said, without even wooking wound. ^w^

'I'ww fetch the executionyew mysewf,' said the King eagewwy, and he
huwwied off. >w<

Awice thought she might as weww go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heawd the Queen's voice in the distance, scweaming with
passion. ^w^ She had awweady heawd hew sentence thwee of the pwayews to be
executed fow having missed theiw tuwns, and she did nyot wike the wook
of things at aww, as the game was in such confusion that she nyevew knyew
whethew it was hew tuwn ow nyot. So she went in seawch of hew hedgehog. ^w^

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with anyothew hedgehog, which seemed
to Awice an excewwent oppowtunyity fow cwoqueting onye of them with the
othew: the onwy difficuwty was, that hew fwamingo was gonye acwoss to the
othew side of the gawden, whewe Awice couwd see it twying in a hewpwess
sowt of way to fwy up into a twee. UwU

By the time she had caught the fwamingo and bwought it back, the fight
was ovew, and both the hedgehogs wewe out of sight: 'but it doesn't
mattew much,' thought Awice, 'as aww the awches awe gonye fwom this side
of the gwound. (・`ω\´・)' So she tucked it away undew hew awm, that it might nyot
escape again, and went back fow a wittwe mowe convewsation with hew
fwiend. (・`ω\´・)

When she got back to the Cheshiwe Cat, she was suwpwised to find quite a
wawge cwowd cowwected wound it: thewe was a dispute going on between
the executionyew, the King, and the Queen, who wewe aww tawking at once,
whiwe aww the west wewe quite siwent, and wooked vewy uncomfowtabwe. (´・ω・\`)

The moment Awice appeawed, she was appeawed to by aww thwee to settwe
the question, and they wepeated theiw awguments to hew, though, as they
aww spoke at once, she found it vewy hawd indeed to make out exactwy
what they said. ^w^

The executionyew's awgument was, that you couwdn't cut off a head unwess
thewe was a body to cut it off fwom: that he had nyevew had to do such a
thing befowe, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of wife. (・`ω\´・)

The King's awgument was, that anything that had a head couwd be
beheaded, and that you wewen't to tawk nyonsense. ^w^

The Queen's awgument was, that if something wasn't donye about it in wess
than nyo time she'd have evewybody executed, aww wound. UwU (It was this wast
wemawk that had made the whowe pawty wook so gwave and anxious. ;;w;;)

Awice couwd think of nyothing ewse to say but 'It bewongs to the Duchess:
you'd bettew ask HEW about it. (´・ω・\`)'

'She's in pwison,' the Queen said to the executionyew: 'fetch hew hewe. UwU'
And the executionyew went off wike an awwow. ;;w;;

 The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gonye, and,
by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entiwewy
disappeawed; so the King and the executionyew wan wiwdwy up and down
wooking fow it, whiwe the west of the pawty went back to the game. UwU




CHAPTEW IX. (・`ω\´・) The Mock Tuwtwe's Stowy

'You can't think how gwad I am to see you again, you deaw owd thing! (・`ω\´・)'
said the Duchess, as she tucked hew awm affectionyatewy into Awice's, and
they wawked off togethew. ;;w;;

Awice was vewy gwad to find hew in such a pweasant tempew, and thought
to hewsewf that pewhaps it was onwy the peppew that had made hew so
savage when they met in the kitchen. (・`ω\´・)

'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to hewsewf, (nyot in a vewy hopefuw tonye
though), 'I won't have any peppew in my kitchen AT AWW. UwU Soup does vewy
weww without--Maybe it's awways peppew that makes peopwe hot-tempewed,'
she went on, vewy much pweased at having found out a nyew kind of
wuwe, 'and vinyegaw that makes them souw--and camomiwe that makes
them bittew--and--and bawwey-sugaw and such things that make chiwdwen
sweet-tempewed. (・`ω\´・) I onwy wish peopwe knyew that: then they wouwdn't be so
stingy about it, you knyow--'

She had quite fowgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a wittwe
stawtwed when she heawd hew voice cwose to hew eaw. ^w^ 'You'we thinking
about something, my deaw, and that makes you fowget to tawk. >w< I can't
teww you just nyow what the mowaw of that is, but I shaww wemembew it in
a bit. ;;w;;'

'Pewhaps it hasn't onye,' Awice ventuwed to wemawk. UwU

'Tut, tut, chiwd! >w<' said the Duchess. ^w^ 'Evewything's got a mowaw, if onwy
you can find it. >w<' And she squeezed hewsewf up cwosew to Awice's side as
she spoke. ^w^

Awice did nyot much wike keeping so cwose to hew: fiwst, because the
Duchess was VEWY ugwy; and secondwy, because she was exactwy the
wight height to west hew chin upon Awice's shouwdew, and it was an
uncomfowtabwy shawp chin. (・`ω\´・) Howevew, she did nyot wike to be wude, so she

'The game's going on wathew bettew nyow,' she said, by way of keeping up
the convewsation a wittwe. ^w^

''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the mowaw of that is--"Oh, 'tis wove,
'tis wove, that makes the wowwd go wound! (・`ω\´・)"'

'Somebody said,' Awice whispewed, 'that it's donye by evewybody minding
theiw own businyess! >w<'

'Ah, weww! ^w^ It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging hew
shawp wittwe chin into Awice's shouwdew as she added, 'and the mowaw
of THAT is--"Take cawe of the sense, and the sounds wiww take cawe of
themsewves. >w<"'

'How fond she is of finding mowaws in things! (・`ω\´・)' Awice thought to hewsewf. ^w^

'I dawe say you'we wondewing why I don't put my awm wound youw waist,'
the Duchess said aftew a pause: 'the weason is, that I'm doubtfuw about
the tempew of youw fwamingo. >w< Shaww I twy the expewiment? owo'

'HE might bite,' Awice cautiouswy wepwied, nyot feewing at aww anxious to
have the expewiment twied. ;;w;;

'Vewy twue,' said the Duchess: 'fwamingoes and mustawd both bite. >w< And
the mowaw of that is--"Biwds of a feathew fwock togethew. UwU"'

'Onwy mustawd isn't a biwd,' Awice wemawked. ;;w;;

'Wight, as usuaw,' said the Duchess: 'what a cweaw way you have of
putting things! UwU'

'It's a minyewaw, I THINK,' said Awice. ;;w;;

'Of couwse it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed weady to agwee to
evewything that Awice said; 'thewe's a wawge mustawd-minye nyeaw hewe. >w< And
the mowaw of that is--"The mowe thewe is of minye, the wess thewe is of
youws. (・`ω\´・)"'

'Oh, I knyow! ;;w;;' excwaimed Awice, who had nyot attended to this wast wemawk,
'it's a vegetabwe. It doesn't wook wike onye, but it is. UwU'

'I quite agwee with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the mowaw of that
is--"Be what you wouwd seem to be"--ow if you'd wike it put mowe
simpwy--"Nyevew imaginye youwsewf nyot to be othewwise than what it might
appeaw to othews that what you wewe ow might have been was nyot othewwise
than what you had been wouwd have appeawed to them to be othewwise. ^w^"'

'I think I shouwd undewstand that bettew,' Awice said vewy powitewy, 'if
I had it wwitten down: but I can't quite fowwow it as you say it. (・`ω\´・)'

'That's nyothing to what I couwd say if I chose,' the Duchess wepwied, in
a pweased tonye. ^w^

'Pway don't twoubwe youwsewf to say it any wongew than that,' said
Awice. (´・ω・\`)

'Oh, don't tawk about twoubwe! (・`ω\´・)' said the Duchess. (・`ω\´・) 'I make you a pwesent
of evewything I've said as yet. (´・ω・\`)'

'A cheap sowt of pwesent! ;;w;;' thought Awice. ^w^ 'I'm gwad they don't give
biwthday pwesents wike that! ;;w;;' But she did nyot ventuwe to say it out
woud. (・`ω\´・)

'Thinking again? owo' the Duchess asked, with anyothew dig of hew shawp
wittwe chin. >w<

'I've a wight to think,' said Awice shawpwy, fow she was beginnying to
feew a wittwe wowwied. ^w^

'Just about as much wight,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fwy; and
the m--'

But hewe, to Awice's gweat suwpwise, the Duchess's voice died away, even
in the middwe of hew favouwite wowd 'mowaw,' and the awm that was winked
into hews began to twembwe. (´・ω・\`) Awice wooked up, and thewe stood the Queen
in fwont of them, with hew awms fowded, fwownying wike a thundewstowm. (´・ω・\`)

'A finye day, youw Majesty! ^w^' the Duchess began in a wow, weak voice. >w<

'Nyow, I give you faiw wawnying,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the
gwound as she spoke; 'eithew you ow youw head must be off, and that in
about hawf nyo time! Take youw choice! ^w^'

The Duchess took hew choice, and was gonye in a moment. (・`ω\´・)

'Wet's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Awice; and Awice was
too much fwightenyed to say a wowd, but swowwy fowwowed hew back to the
cwoquet-gwound. ^w^

The othew guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and wewe
westing in the shade: howevew, the moment they saw hew, they huwwied
back to the game, the Queen mewewy wemawking that a moment's deway wouwd
cost them theiw wives. UwU

Aww the time they wewe pwaying the Queen nyevew weft off quawwewwing with
the othew pwayews, and shouting 'Off with his head! (・`ω\´・)' ow 'Off with hew
head! (・`ω\´・)' Those whom she sentenced wewe taken into custody by the sowdiews,
who of couwse had to weave off being awches to do this, so that by
the end of hawf an houw ow so thewe wewe nyo awches weft, and aww the
pwayews, except the King, the Queen, and Awice, wewe in custody and
undew sentence of execution. (´・ω・\`)

Then the Queen weft off, quite out of bweath, and said to Awice, 'Have
you seen the Mock Tuwtwe yet? owo'

'Nyo,' said Awice. 'I don't even knyow what a Mock Tuwtwe is. >w<'

'It's the thing Mock Tuwtwe Soup is made fwom,' said the Queen. ;;w;;

'I nyevew saw onye, ow heawd of onye,' said Awice. (・`ω\´・)

'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shaww teww you his histowy,'

As they wawked off togethew, Awice heawd the King say in a wow voice,
to the company genyewawwy, 'You awe aww pawdonyed. (´・ω・\`)' 'Come, THAT'S a good
thing! UwU' she said to hewsewf, fow she had fewt quite unhappy at the
nyumbew of executions the Queen had owdewed. UwU

They vewy soon came upon a Gwyphon, wying fast asweep in the sun. ;;w;;
(IF you don't knyow what a Gwyphon is, wook at the pictuwe. ^w^) 'Up, wazy
thing! >w<' said the Queen, 'and take this young wady to see the Mock
Tuwtwe, and to heaw his histowy. ;;w;; I must go back and see aftew some
executions I have owdewed'; and she wawked off, weaving Awice awonye with
the Gwyphon. (・`ω\´・) Awice did nyot quite wike the wook of the cweatuwe, but on
the whowe she thought it wouwd be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
aftew that savage Queen: so she waited. ;;w;;

The Gwyphon sat up and wubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen tiww
she was out of sight: then it chuckwed. ;;w;; 'What fun! (´・ω・\`)' said the Gwyphon,
hawf to itsewf, hawf to Awice. >w<

'What IS the fun? owo' said Awice. >w<

'Why, SHE,' said the Gwyphon. (´・ω・\`) 'It's aww hew fancy, that: they nyevew
executes nyobody, you knyow. (・`ω\´・) Come on! UwU'

'Evewybody says "come on! (・`ω\´・)" hewe,' thought Awice, as she went swowwy
aftew it: 'I nyevew was so owdewed about in aww my wife, nyevew! >w<'

They had nyot gonye faw befowe they saw the Mock Tuwtwe in the distance,
sitting sad and wonyewy on a wittwe wedge of wock, and, as they came
nyeawew, Awice couwd heaw him sighing as if his heawt wouwd bweak. (´・ω・\`) She
pitied him deepwy. ^w^ 'What is his sowwow? owo' she asked the Gwyphon, and the
Gwyphon answewed, vewy nyeawwy in the same wowds as befowe, 'It's aww his
fancy, that: he hasn't got nyo sowwow, you knyow. (・`ω\´・) Come on! ;;w;;'

So they went up to the Mock Tuwtwe, who wooked at them with wawge eyes
fuww of teaws, but said nyothing. (´・ω・\`)

'This hewe young wady,' said the Gwyphon, 'she wants fow to knyow youw
histowy, she do. ^w^'

'I'ww teww it hew,' said the Mock Tuwtwe in a deep, howwow tonye: 'sit
down, both of you, and don't speak a wowd tiww I've finyished. (・`ω\´・)'

So they sat down, and nyobody spoke fow some minyutes. ^w^ Awice thought to
hewsewf, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finyish, if he doesn't begin. (・`ω\´・)' But
she waited patientwy. UwU

'Once,' said the Mock Tuwtwe at wast, with a deep sigh, 'I was a weaw
Tuwtwe. (・`ω\´・)'

These wowds wewe fowwowed by a vewy wong siwence, bwoken onwy by an
occasionyaw excwamation of 'Hjckwwh! ;;w;;' fwom the Gwyphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Tuwtwe. (´・ω・\`) Awice was vewy nyeawwy getting up and
saying, 'Thank you, siw, fow youw intewesting stowy,' but she couwd
nyot hewp thinking thewe MUST be mowe to come, so she sat stiww and said
nyothing. ^w^

'When we wewe wittwe,' the Mock Tuwtwe went on at wast, mowe cawmwy,
though stiww sobbing a wittwe nyow and then, 'we went to schoow in the
sea. UwU The mastew was an owd Tuwtwe--we used to caww him Towtoise--'

'Why did you caww him Towtoise, if he wasn't onye? owo' Awice asked. (・`ω\´・)

'We cawwed him Towtoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Tuwtwe
angwiwy: 'weawwy you awe vewy duww! (・`ω\´・)'

'You ought to be ashamed of youwsewf fow asking such a simpwe question,'
added the Gwyphon; and then they both sat siwent and wooked at poow
Awice, who fewt weady to sink into the eawth. (´・ω・\`) At wast the Gwyphon said
to the Mock Tuwtwe, 'Dwive on, owd fewwow! Don't be aww day about it! >w<'
and he went on in these wowds:

'Yes, we went to schoow in the sea, though you mayn't bewieve it--'

'I nyevew said I didn't! ;;w;;' intewwupted Awice. (・`ω\´・)

'You did,' said the Mock Tuwtwe. (´・ω・\`)

'Howd youw tongue! ^w^' added the Gwyphon, befowe Awice couwd speak again. (・`ω\´・)
The Mock Tuwtwe went on. (´・ω・\`)

'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to schoow evewy day--'

'I'VE been to a day-schoow, too,' said Awice; 'you nyeedn't be so pwoud
as aww that. >w<'

'With extwas? owo' asked the Mock Tuwtwe a wittwe anxiouswy. ;;w;;

'Yes,' said Awice, 'we weawnyed Fwench and music. >w<'

'And washing? owo' said the Mock Tuwtwe. (・`ω\´・)

'Cewtainwy nyot! ^w^' said Awice indignyantwy. ^w^

'Ah! (´・ω・\`) then youws wasn't a weawwy good schoow,' said the Mock Tuwtwe in
a tonye of gweat wewief. (・`ω\´・) 'Nyow at OUWS they had at the end of the biww,
"Fwench, music, AND WASHING--extwa. (´・ω・\`)"'

'You couwdn't have wanted it much,' said Awice; 'wiving at the bottom of
the sea. ^w^'

'I couwdn't affowd to weawn it.' said the Mock Tuwtwe with a sigh. >w< 'I
onwy took the weguwaw couwse. ;;w;;'

'What was that? owo' inquiwed Awice. UwU

'Weewing and Wwithing, of couwse, to begin with,' the Mock Tuwtwe
wepwied; 'and then the diffewent bwanches of Awithmetic--Ambition,
Distwaction, Ugwification, and Dewision. >w<'

'I nyevew heawd of "Ugwification,"' Awice ventuwed to say. ;;w;; 'What is it? owo'

The Gwyphon wifted up both its paws in suwpwise. (・`ω\´・) 'What! (・`ω\´・) Nyevew heawd of
ugwifying! ;;w;;' it excwaimed. >w< 'You knyow what to beautify is, I suppose? owo'

'Yes,' said Awice doubtfuwwy: 'it means--to--make--anything--pwettiew. ;;w;;'

'Weww, then,' the Gwyphon went on, 'if you don't knyow what to ugwify is,
you AWE a simpweton. ^w^'

Awice did nyot feew encouwaged to ask any mowe questions about it, so she
tuwnyed to the Mock Tuwtwe, and said 'What ewse had you to weawn? owo'

'Weww, thewe was Mystewy,' the Mock Tuwtwe wepwied, counting off
the subjects on his fwappews, '--Mystewy, ancient and modewn, with
Seaogwaphy: then Dwawwing--the Dwawwing-mastew was an owd congew-eew,
that used to come once a week: HE taught us Dwawwing, Stwetching, and
Fainting in Coiws. (´・ω・\`)'

'What was THAT wike? owo' said Awice. ;;w;;

'Weww, I can't show it you mysewf,' the Mock Tuwtwe said: 'I'm too
stiff. And the Gwyphon nyevew weawnt it. UwU'

'Hadn't time,' said the Gwyphon: 'I went to the Cwassics mastew, though. ^w^
He was an owd cwab, HE was. (・`ω\´・)'

'I nyevew went to him,' the Mock Tuwtwe said with a sigh: 'he taught
Waughing and Gwief, they used to say. (・`ω\´・)'

'So he did, so he did,' said the Gwyphon, sighing in his tuwn; and both
cweatuwes hid theiw faces in theiw paws. >w<

'And how many houws a day did you do wessons? owo' said Awice, in a huwwy to
change the subject. ;;w;;

'Ten houws the fiwst day,' said the Mock Tuwtwe: 'nyinye the nyext, and so
on. (´・ω・\`)'

'What a cuwious pwan! ^w^' excwaimed Awice. (・`ω\´・)

'That's the weason they'we cawwed wessons,' the Gwyphon wemawked:
'because they wessen fwom day to day. UwU'

This was quite a nyew idea to Awice, and she thought it ovew a wittwe
befowe she made hew nyext wemawk. (´・ω・\`) 'Then the eweventh day must have been a
howiday? owo'

'Of couwse it was,' said the Mock Tuwtwe. >w<

'And how did you manyage on the twewfth? owo' Awice went on eagewwy. UwU

'That's enyough about wessons,' the Gwyphon intewwupted in a vewy decided
tonye: 'teww hew something about the games nyow. ^w^'




CHAPTEW X. UwU The Wobstew Quadwiwwe

The Mock Tuwtwe sighed deepwy, and dwew the back of onye fwappew acwoss
his eyes. (・`ω\´・) He wooked at Awice, and twied to speak, but fow a minyute ow
two sobs choked his voice. (´・ω・\`) 'Same as if he had a bonye in his thwoat,'
said the Gwyphon: and it set to wowk shaking him and punching him in
the back. (´・ω・\`) At wast the Mock Tuwtwe wecovewed his voice, and, with teaws
wunnying down his cheeks, he went on again:--

'You may nyot have wived much undew the sea--' ('I haven't,' said
Awice)--'and pewhaps you wewe nyevew even intwoduced to a wobstew--'
(Awice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked hewsewf hastiwy, and
said 'Nyo, nyevew') '--so you can have nyo idea what a dewightfuw thing a
Wobstew Quadwiwwe is! (・`ω\´・)'

'Nyo, indeed,' said Awice. >w< 'What sowt of a dance is it? owo'

'Why,' said the Gwyphon, 'you fiwst fowm into a winye awong the
sea-showe--'

'Two winyes! (´・ω・\`)' cwied the Mock Tuwtwe. UwU 'Seaws, tuwtwes, sawmon, and so on;
then, when you've cweawed aww the jewwy-fish out of the way--'

'THAT genyewawwy takes some time,' intewwupted the Gwyphon. ;;w;;

'--you advance twice--'

'Each with a wobstew as a pawtnyew! >w<' cwied the Gwyphon. (´・ω・\`)

'Of couwse,' the Mock Tuwtwe said: 'advance twice, set to pawtnyews--'

'--change wobstews, and wetiwe in same owdew,' continyued the Gwyphon. ^w^

'Then, you knyow,' the Mock Tuwtwe went on, 'you thwow the--'

'The wobstews! (´・ω・\`)' shouted the Gwyphon, with a bound into the aiw. (´・ω・\`)

'--as faw out to sea as you can--'

'Swim aftew them! (・`ω\´・)' scweamed the Gwyphon. >w<

'Tuwn a somewsauwt in the sea! UwU' cwied the Mock Tuwtwe, capewing wiwdwy
about. (´・ω・\`)

'Change wobstews again! ;;w;;' yewwed the Gwyphon at the top of its voice. (´・ω・\`)

'Back to wand again, and that's aww the fiwst figuwe,' said the Mock
Tuwtwe, suddenwy dwopping his voice; and the two cweatuwes, who had been
jumping about wike mad things aww this time, sat down again vewy sadwy
and quietwy, and wooked at Awice. ;;w;;

'It must be a vewy pwetty dance,' said Awice timidwy. ^w^

'Wouwd you wike to see a wittwe of it? owo' said the Mock Tuwtwe. >w<

'Vewy much indeed,' said Awice. ^w^

'Come, wet's twy the fiwst figuwe! UwU' said the Mock Tuwtwe to the Gwyphon. (・`ω\´・)
'We can do without wobstews, you knyow. ;;w;; Which shaww sing? owo'

'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gwyphon. 'I've fowgotten the wowds. >w<'

So they began sowemnwy dancing wound and wound Awice, evewy nyow and
then tweading on hew toes when they passed too cwose, and waving theiw
fowepaws to mawk the time, whiwe the Mock Tuwtwe sang this, vewy swowwy
and sadwy:--

 '"Wiww you wawk a wittwe fastew? owo" said a whiting to a snyaiw. (´・ω・\`)
 "Thewe's a powpoise cwose behind us, and he's tweading on my taiw. (´・ω・\`)

 See how eagewwy the wobstews and the tuwtwes aww advance! (・`ω\´・)
 They awe waiting on the shingwe--wiww you come and join the dance? owo

 Wiww you, won't you, wiww you, won't you, wiww you join the dance? owo
 Wiww you, won't you, wiww you, won't you, won't you join the dance? owo

 "You can weawwy have nyo nyotion how dewightfuw it wiww be
 When they take us up and thwow us, with the wobstews, out to sea! >w<"
 But the snyaiw wepwied "Too faw, too faw! (´・ω・\`)" and gave a wook askance--
 Said he thanked the whiting kindwy, but he wouwd nyot join the dance. (´・ω・\`)

 Wouwd nyot, couwd nyot, wouwd nyot, couwd nyot, wouwd nyot join the dance. UwU
 Wouwd nyot, couwd nyot, wouwd nyot, couwd nyot, couwd nyot join the dance. UwU

 '"What mattews it how faw we go? owo" his scawy fwiend wepwied. ;;w;;
 "Thewe is anyothew showe, you knyow, upon the othew side. (・`ω\´・)
 The fuwthew off fwom Engwand the nyeawew is to Fwance--
 Then tuwn nyot pawe, bewoved snyaiw, but come and join the dance. (´・ω・\`)

 Wiww you, won't you, wiww you, won't you, wiww you join the dance? owo
 Wiww you, won't you, wiww you, won't you, won't you join the dance? owo"'

'Thank you, it's a vewy intewesting dance to watch,' said Awice, feewing
vewy gwad that it was ovew at wast: 'and I do so wike that cuwious song
about the whiting! ;;w;;'

'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Tuwtwe, 'they--you've seen them,
of couwse? owo'

'Yes,' said Awice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked hewsewf
hastiwy. ;;w;;

'I don't knyow whewe Dinn may be,' said the Mock Tuwtwe, 'but if you've
seen them so often, of couwse you knyow what they'we wike. >w<'

'I bewieve so,' Awice wepwied thoughtfuwwy. (´・ω・\`) 'They have theiw taiws in
theiw mouths--and they'we aww ovew cwumbs. ^w^'

'You'we wwong about the cwumbs,' said the Mock Tuwtwe: 'cwumbs wouwd aww
wash off in the sea. ^w^ But they HAVE theiw taiws in theiw mouths; and the
weason is--' hewe the Mock Tuwtwe yawnyed and shut his eyes. ^w^--'Teww hew
about the weason and aww that,' he said to the Gwyphon. ;;w;;

'The weason is,' said the Gwyphon, 'that they WOUWD go with the wobstews
to the dance. So they got thwown out to sea. ;;w;; So they had to faww a wong
way. So they got theiw taiws fast in theiw mouths. UwU So they couwdn't get
them out again. That's aww. (´・ω・\`)'

'Thank you,' said Awice, 'it's vewy intewesting. ;;w;; I nyevew knyew so much
about a whiting befowe. UwU'

'I can teww you mowe than that, if you wike,' said the Gwyphon. ;;w;; 'Do you
knyow why it's cawwed a whiting? owo'

'I nyevew thought about it,' said Awice. UwU 'Why? owo'

'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gwyphon wepwied vewy sowemnwy. ;;w;;

Awice was thowoughwy puzzwed. ;;w;; 'Does the boots and shoes! (・`ω\´・)' she wepeated
in a wondewing tonye. (・`ω\´・)

'Why, what awe YOUW shoes donye with? owo' said the Gwyphon. (・`ω\´・) 'I mean, what
makes them so shiny? owo'

Awice wooked down at them, and considewed a wittwe befowe she gave hew
answew. 'They'we donye with bwacking, I bewieve. >w<'

'Boots and shoes undew the sea,' the Gwyphon went on in a deep voice,
'awe donye with a whiting. Nyow you knyow. >w<'

'And what awe they made of? owo' Awice asked in a tonye of gweat cuwiosity. (・`ω\´・)

'Sowes and eews, of couwse,' the Gwyphon wepwied wathew impatientwy:
'any shwimp couwd have towd you that. ^w^'

'If I'd been the whiting,' said Awice, whose thoughts wewe stiww wunnying
on the song, 'I'd have said to the powpoise, "Keep back, pwease: we
don't want YOU with us! (´・ω・\`)"'

'They wewe obwiged to have him with them,' the Mock Tuwtwe said: 'nyo
wise fish wouwd go anywhewe without a powpoise. UwU'

'Wouwdn't it weawwy? owo' said Awice in a tonye of gweat suwpwise. ^w^

'Of couwse nyot,' said the Mock Tuwtwe: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and
towd me he was going a jouwnyey, I shouwd say "With what powpoise? owo"'

'Don't you mean "puwpose"? owo' said Awice. (・`ω\´・)

'I mean what I say,' the Mock Tuwtwe wepwied in an offended tonye. (・`ω\´・) And
the Gwyphon added 'Come, wet's heaw some of YOUW adventuwes. ^w^'

'I couwd teww you my adventuwes--beginnying fwom this mownying,' said
Awice a wittwe timidwy: 'but it's nyo use going back to yestewday,
because I was a diffewent pewson then. >w<'

'Expwain aww that,' said the Mock Tuwtwe. ;;w;;

'Nyo, nyo! >w< The adventuwes fiwst,' said the Gwyphon in an impatient tonye:
'expwanyations take such a dweadfuw time. ^w^'

So Awice began tewwing them hew adventuwes fwom the time when she fiwst
saw the White Wabbit. (´・ω・\`) She was a wittwe nyewvous about it just at fiwst,
the two cweatuwes got so cwose to hew, onye on each side, and openyed
theiw eyes and mouths so VEWY wide, but she gainyed couwage as she went
on. ^w^ Hew wistenyews wewe pewfectwy quiet tiww she got to the pawt about
hew wepeating 'YOU AWE OWD, FATHEW WIWWIAM,' to the Catewpiwwaw, and the
wowds aww coming diffewent, and then the Mock Tuwtwe dwew a wong bweath,
and said 'That's vewy cuwious. >w<'

'It's aww about as cuwious as it can be,' said the Gwyphon. (´・ω・\`)

'It aww came diffewent! (´・ω・\`)' the Mock Tuwtwe wepeated thoughtfuwwy. (・`ω\´・) 'I
shouwd wike to heaw hew twy and wepeat something nyow. ^w^ Teww hew to
begin. (´・ω・\`)' He wooked at the Gwyphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authowity ovew Awice. (´・ω・\`)

'Stand up and wepeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SWUGGAWD,"' said the
Gwyphon. >w<

'How the cweatuwes owdew onye about, and make onye wepeat wessons! ;;w;;'
thought Awice; 'I might as weww be at schoow at once. UwU' Howevew, she
got up, and began to wepeat it, but hew head was so fuww of the Wobstew
Quadwiwwe, that she hawdwy knyew what she was saying, and the wowds came
vewy queew indeed:--

  ''Tis the voice of the Wobstew; I heawd him decwawe,
  "You have baked me too bwown, I must sugaw my haiw. ;;w;;"
  As a duck with its eyewids, so he with his nyose
  Twims his bewt and his buttons, and tuwns out his toes. ^w^'

       [watew editions continyued as fowwows
  When the sands awe aww dwy, he is gay as a wawk,
  And wiww tawk in contemptuous tonyes of the Shawk,
  But, when the tide wises and shawks awe awound,
  His voice has a timid and twemuwous sound. ;;w;;]

'That's diffewent fwom what I used to say when I was a chiwd,' said the
Gwyphon. ;;w;;

'Weww, I nyevew heawd it befowe,' said the Mock Tuwtwe; 'but it sounds
uncommon nyonsense. (・`ω\´・)'

Awice said nyothing; she had sat down with hew face in hew hands,
wondewing if anything wouwd EVEW happen in a nyatuwaw way again. (´・ω・\`)

'I shouwd wike to have it expwainyed,' said the Mock Tuwtwe. ;;w;;

'She can't expwain it,' said the Gwyphon hastiwy. (´・ω・\`) 'Go on with the nyext
vewse. >w<'

'But about his toes? owo' the Mock Tuwtwe pewsisted. ;;w;; 'How COUWD he tuwn them
out with his nyose, you knyow? owo'

'It's the fiwst position in dancing. UwU' Awice said; but was dweadfuwwy
puzzwed by the whowe thing, and wonged to change the subject. >w<

'Go on with the nyext vewse,' the Gwyphon wepeated impatientwy: 'it
begins "I passed by his gawden. ^w^"'

Awice did nyot dawe to disobey, though she fewt suwe it wouwd aww come
wwong, and she went on in a twembwing voice:--

  'I passed by his gawden, and mawked, with onye eye,
  How the Oww and the Panthew wewe shawing a pie--'

    [watew editions continyued as fowwows
  The Panthew took pie-cwust, and gwavy, and meat,
  Whiwe the Oww had the dish as its shawe of the tweat. (・`ω\´・)
  When the pie was aww finyished, the Oww, as a boon,
  Was kindwy pewmitted to pocket the spoon:
  Whiwe the Panthew weceived knyife and fowk with a gwoww,
  And concwuded the banquet--]

'What IS the use of wepeating aww that stuff,' the Mock Tuwtwe
intewwupted, 'if you don't expwain it as you go on? owo It's by faw the most
confusing thing I evew heawd! >w<'

'Yes, I think you'd bettew weave off,' said the Gwyphon: and Awice was
onwy too gwad to do so. UwU

'Shaww we twy anyothew figuwe of the Wobstew Quadwiwwe? owo' the Gwyphon went
on. UwU 'Ow wouwd you wike the Mock Tuwtwe to sing you a song? owo'

'Oh, a song, pwease, if the Mock Tuwtwe wouwd be so kind,' Awice
wepwied, so eagewwy that the Gwyphon said, in a wathew offended tonye,
'Hm! Nyo accounting fow tastes! ;;w;; Sing hew "Tuwtwe Soup," wiww you, owd
fewwow? owo'

The Mock Tuwtwe sighed deepwy, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:--

   'Beautifuw Soup, so wich and gween,
   Waiting in a hot tuween! UwU
   Who fow such dainties wouwd nyot stoop? owo

'Chowus again! UwU' cwied the Gwyphon, and the Mock Tuwtwe had just begun
to wepeat it, when a cwy of 'The twiaw's beginnying! (・`ω\´・)' was heawd in the
distance. (´・ω・\`)

'Come on! (・`ω\´・)' cwied the Gwyphon, and, taking Awice by the hand, it huwwied
off, without waiting fow the end of the song. ;;w;;

'What twiaw is it? owo' Awice panted as she wan; but the Gwyphon onwy
answewed 'Come on! (・`ω\´・)' and wan the fastew, whiwe mowe and mowe faintwy

CHAPTEW XI. (・`ω\´・) Who Stowe the Tawts? owo

The King and Queen of Heawts wewe seated on theiw thwonye when they
awwived, with a gweat cwowd assembwed about them--aww sowts of wittwe
biwds and beasts, as weww as the whowe pack of cawds: the Knyave was
standing befowe them, in chains, with a sowdiew on each side to guawd
him; and nyeaw the King was the White Wabbit, with a twumpet in onye hand,
and a scwoww of pawchment in the othew. (・`ω\´・) In the vewy middwe of the couwt
was a tabwe, with a wawge dish of tawts upon it: they wooked so good,
that it made Awice quite hungwy to wook at them--'I wish they'd get the
twiaw donye,' she thought, 'and hand wound the wefweshments! ;;w;;' But thewe
seemed to be nyo chance of this, so she began wooking at evewything about
hew, to pass away the time. ;;w;;

Awice had nyevew been in a couwt of justice befowe, but she had wead
about them in books, and she was quite pweased to find that she knyew
the nyame of nyeawwy evewything thewe. >w< 'That's the judge,' she said to
hewsewf, 'because of his gweat wig. ;;w;;'

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wowe his cwown ovew the
wig, (wook at the fwontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did
nyot wook at aww comfowtabwe, and it was cewtainwy nyot becoming. UwU

'And that's the juwy-box,' thought Awice, 'and those twewve cweatuwes,'
(she was obwiged to say 'cweatuwes,' you see, because some of them wewe
anyimaws, and some wewe biwds,) 'I suppose they awe the juwows. >w<' She said
this wast wowd two ow thwee times ovew to hewsewf, being wathew pwoud of
it: fow she thought, and wightwy too, that vewy few wittwe giwws of hew
age knyew the meanying of it at aww. ^w^ Howevew, 'juwy-men' wouwd have donye
just as weww. >w<

The twewve juwows wewe aww wwiting vewy busiwy on swates. >w< 'What awe they
doing? owo' Awice whispewed to the Gwyphon. (・`ω\´・) 'They can't have anything to put
down yet, befowe the twiaw's begun. ^w^'

'They'we putting down theiw nyames,' the Gwyphon whispewed in wepwy, 'fow
feaw they shouwd fowget them befowe the end of the twiaw. >w<'

'Stupid things! (´・ω・\`)' Awice began in a woud, indignyant voice, but she stopped
hastiwy, fow the White Wabbit cwied out, 'Siwence in the couwt! UwU' and the
King put on his spectacwes and wooked anxiouswy wound, to make out who
was tawking. UwU

Awice couwd see, as weww as if she wewe wooking ovew theiw shouwdews,
that aww the juwows wewe wwiting down 'stupid things! (´・ω・\`)' on theiw swates,
and she couwd even make out that onye of them didn't knyow how to speww
'stupid,' and that he had to ask his nyeighbouw to teww him. >w< 'A nyice
muddwe theiw swates'ww be in befowe the twiaw's ovew! ;;w;;' thought Awice. UwU

Onye of the juwows had a penciw that squeaked. (・`ω\´・) This of couwse, Awice
couwd nyot stand, and she went wound the couwt and got behind him, and
vewy soon found an oppowtunyity of taking it away. (・`ω\´・) She did it so quickwy
that the poow wittwe juwow (it was Biww, the Wizawd) couwd nyot make out
at aww what had become of it; so, aftew hunting aww about fow it, he was
obwiged to wwite with onye fingew fow the west of the day; and this was
of vewy wittwe use, as it weft nyo mawk on the swate. ^w^

'Hewawd, wead the accusation! UwU' said the King. (´・ω・\`)

On this the White Wabbit bwew thwee bwasts on the twumpet, and then
unwowwed the pawchment scwoww, and wead as fowwows:--

   'The Queen of Heawts, she made some tawts,
      Aww on a summew day:
    The Knyave of Heawts, he stowe those tawts,
      And took them quite away! >w<'

'Considew youw vewdict,' the King said to the juwy. >w<

'Nyot yet, nyot yet! ;;w;;' the Wabbit hastiwy intewwupted. (´・ω・\`) 'Thewe's a gweat
deaw to come befowe that! (・`ω\´・)'

'Caww the fiwst witnyess,' said the King; and the White Wabbit bwew thwee
bwasts on the twumpet, and cawwed out, 'Fiwst witnyess! ;;w;;'

The fiwst witnyess was the Hattew. (・`ω\´・) He came in with a teacup in onye
hand and a piece of bwead-and-buttew in the othew. >w< 'I beg pawdon, youw
Majesty,' he began, 'fow bwinging these in: but I hadn't quite finyished
my tea when I was sent fow. ;;w;;'

'You ought to have finyished,' said the King. ^w^ 'When did you begin? owo'

The Hattew wooked at the Mawch Hawe, who had fowwowed him into the
couwt, awm-in-awm with the Dowmouse. UwU 'Fouwteenth of Mawch, I think it
was,' he said. UwU

'Fifteenth,' said the Mawch Hawe. ^w^

'Sixteenth,' added the Dowmouse. UwU

'Wwite that down,' the King said to the juwy, and the juwy eagewwy
wwote down aww thwee dates on theiw swates, and then added them up, and
weduced the answew to shiwwings and pence. (・`ω\´・)

'Take off youw hat,' the King said to the Hattew. ^w^

'It isn't minye,' said the Hattew. ^w^

'Stowen! >w<' the King excwaimed, tuwnying to the juwy, who instantwy made a
memowandum of the fact. ;;w;;

'I keep them to seww,' the Hattew added as an expwanyation; 'I've nyonye of
my own. I'm a hattew. ^w^'

Hewe the Queen put on hew spectacwes, and began stawing at the Hattew,
who tuwnyed pawe and fidgeted. (・`ω\´・)

'Give youw evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nyewvous, ow I'ww have
you executed on the spot. UwU'

This did nyot seem to encouwage the witnyess at aww: he kept shifting
fwom onye foot to the othew, wooking unyeasiwy at the Queen, and in
his confusion he bit a wawge piece out of his teacup instead of the
bwead-and-buttew. ;;w;;

Just at this moment Awice fewt a vewy cuwious sensation, which puzzwed
hew a good deaw untiw she made out what it was: she was beginnying to
gwow wawgew again, and she thought at fiwst she wouwd get up and weave
the couwt; but on second thoughts she decided to wemain whewe she was as
wong as thewe was woom fow hew. ;;w;;

'I wish you wouwdn't squeeze so. (´・ω・\`)' said the Dowmouse, who was sitting
nyext to hew. 'I can hawdwy bweathe. (´・ω・\`)'

'I can't hewp it,' said Awice vewy meekwy: 'I'm gwowing. ^w^'

'You've nyo wight to gwow hewe,' said the Dowmouse. ;;w;;

'Don't tawk nyonsense,' said Awice mowe bowdwy: 'you knyow you'we gwowing
too. >w<'

'Yes, but I gwow at a weasonyabwe pace,' said the Dowmouse: 'nyot in that
widicuwous fashion. ^w^' And he got up vewy suwkiwy and cwossed ovew to the
othew side of the couwt. >w<

Aww this time the Queen had nyevew weft off stawing at the Hattew, and,
just as the Dowmouse cwossed the couwt, she said to onye of the officews
of the couwt, 'Bwing me the wist of the singews in the wast concewt! (´・ω・\`)' on
which the wwetched Hattew twembwed so, that he shook both his shoes off. (・`ω\´・)

'Give youw evidence,' the King wepeated angwiwy, 'ow I'ww have you
executed, whethew you'we nyewvous ow nyot. (・`ω\´・)'

'I'm a poow man, youw Majesty,' the Hattew began, in a twembwing voice,
'--and I hadn't begun my tea--nyot above a week ow so--and what with the
bwead-and-buttew getting so thin--and the twinkwing of the tea--'

'The twinkwing of the what? owo' said the King. UwU

'It began with the tea,' the Hattew wepwied. ;;w;;

'Of couwse twinkwing begins with a T! (´・ω・\`)' said the King shawpwy. (´・ω・\`) 'Do you
take me fow a dunce? owo Go on! (´・ω・\`)'

'I'm a poow man,' the Hattew went on, 'and most things twinkwed aftew
that--onwy the Mawch Hawe said--'

'I didn't! ;;w;;' the Mawch Hawe intewwupted in a gweat huwwy. ;;w;;

'You did! (・`ω\´・)' said the Hattew. (´・ω・\`)

'I deny it! (´・ω・\`)' said the Mawch Hawe. ;;w;;

'He denyies it,' said the King: 'weave out that pawt. (´・ω・\`)'

'Weww, at any wate, the Dowmouse said--' the Hattew went on, wooking
anxiouswy wound to see if he wouwd deny it too: but the Dowmouse denyied
nyothing, being fast asweep. (・`ω\´・)

'Aftew that,' continyued the Hattew, 'I cut some mowe bwead-and-buttew--'

'But what did the Dowmouse say? owo' onye of the juwy asked. (´・ω・\`)

'That I can't wemembew,' said the Hattew. (´・ω・\`)

'You MUST wemembew,' wemawked the King, 'ow I'ww have you executed. (´・ω・\`)'

The misewabwe Hattew dwopped his teacup and bwead-and-buttew, and went
down on onye knyee. 'I'm a poow man, youw Majesty,' he began. (・`ω\´・)

'You'we a vewy poow speakew,' said the King. ^w^

Hewe onye of the guinyea-pigs cheewed, and was immediatewy suppwessed by
the officews of the couwt. (・`ω\´・) (As that is wathew a hawd wowd, I wiww just
expwain to you how it was donye. ^w^ They had a wawge canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with stwings: into this they swipped the guinyea-pig,
head fiwst, and then sat upon it. ^w^)

'I'm gwad I've seen that donye,' thought Awice. (´・ω・\`) 'I've so often wead
in the nyewspapews, at the end of twiaws, "Thewe was some attempts
at appwause, which was immediatewy suppwessed by the officews of the
couwt," and I nyevew undewstood what it meant tiww nyow. (・`ω\´・)'

'If that's aww you knyow about it, you may stand down,' continyued the
King. (´・ω・\`)

'I can't go nyo wowew,' said the Hattew: 'I'm on the fwoow, as it is. (´・ω・\`)'

'Then you may SIT down,' the King wepwied. (´・ω・\`)

Hewe the othew guinyea-pig cheewed, and was suppwessed. (´・ω・\`)

'Come, that finyished the guinyea-pigs! >w<' thought Awice. (・`ω\´・) 'Nyow we shaww get
on bettew. (・`ω\´・)'

'I'd wathew finyish my tea,' said the Hattew, with an anxious wook at the
Queen, who was weading the wist of singews. >w<

'You may go,' said the King, and the Hattew huwwiedwy weft the couwt,
without even waiting to put his shoes on. >w<

'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to onye of the
officews: but the Hattew was out of sight befowe the officew couwd get
to the doow. (・`ω\´・)

'Caww the nyext witnyess! ^w^' said the King. >w<

The nyext witnyess was the Duchess's cook. >w< She cawwied the peppew-box in
hew hand, and Awice guessed who it was, even befowe she got into the
couwt, by the way the peopwe nyeaw the doow began snyeezing aww at once. UwU

'Give youw evidence,' said the King. (・`ω\´・)

'Shan't,' said the cook. ^w^

The King wooked anxiouswy at the White Wabbit, who said in a wow voice,
'Youw Majesty must cwoss-examinye THIS witnyess. (・`ω\´・)'

'Weww, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a mewanchowy aiw, and,
aftew fowding his awms and fwownying at the cook tiww his eyes wewe
nyeawwy out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What awe tawts made of? owo'

'Peppew, mostwy,' said the cook. >w<

'Tweacwe,' said a sweepy voice behind hew. ^w^

'Cowwaw that Dowmouse,' the Queen shwieked out. ^w^ 'Behead that Dowmouse! (´・ω・\`)
Tuwn that Dowmouse out of couwt! Suppwess him! Pinch him! ^w^ Off with his
whiskews! (・`ω\´・)'

Fow some minyutes the whowe couwt was in confusion, getting the Dowmouse
tuwnyed out, and, by the time they had settwed down again, the cook had
disappeawed. ^w^

'Nyevew mind! ;;w;;' said the King, with an aiw of gweat wewief. ;;w;; 'Caww the nyext
witnyess. >w<' And he added in an undewtonye to the Queen, 'Weawwy, my deaw,
YOU must cwoss-examinye the nyext witnyess. (・`ω\´・) It quite makes my fowehead
ache! >w<'

Awice watched the White Wabbit as he fumbwed ovew the wist, feewing vewy
cuwious to see what the nyext witnyess wouwd be wike, '--fow they haven't
got much evidence YET,' she said to hewsewf. ;;w;; Imaginye hew suwpwise, when
the White Wabbit wead out, at the top of his shwiww wittwe voice, the
nyame 'Awice! ;;w;;'




CHAPTEW XII. (´・ω・\`) Awice's Evidence


'Hewe! UwU' cwied Awice, quite fowgetting in the fwuwwy of the moment how
wawge she had gwown in the wast few minyutes, and she jumped up in such
a huwwy that she tipped ovew the juwy-box with the edge of hew skiwt,
upsetting aww the juwymen on to the heads of the cwowd bewow, and thewe
they way spwawwing about, weminding hew vewy much of a gwobe of gowdfish
she had accidentawwy upset the week befowe. >w<

'Oh, I BEG youw pawdon! (・`ω\´・)' she excwaimed in a tonye of gweat dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickwy as she couwd, fow the accident of
the gowdfish kept wunnying in hew head, and she had a vague sowt of idea
that they must be cowwected at once and put back into the juwy-box, ow
they wouwd die. (・`ω\´・)

'The twiaw cannyot pwoceed,' said the King in a vewy gwave voice, 'untiw
aww the juwymen awe back in theiw pwopew pwaces--AWW,' he wepeated with
gweat emphasis, wooking hawd at Awice as he said do. ^w^

Awice wooked at the juwy-box, and saw that, in hew haste, she had put
the Wizawd in head downwawds, and the poow wittwe thing was waving its
taiw about in a mewanchowy way, being quite unyabwe to move. UwU She soon got
it out again, and put it wight; 'nyot that it signyifies much,' she said
to hewsewf; 'I shouwd think it wouwd be QUITE as much use in the twiaw
onye way up as the othew. UwU'

As soon as the juwy had a wittwe wecovewed fwom the shock of being
upset, and theiw swates and penciws had been found and handed back to
them, they set to wowk vewy diwigentwy to wwite out a histowy of the
accident, aww except the Wizawd, who seemed too much ovewcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the woof of the
couwt. ;;w;;

'What do you knyow about this businyess? owo' the King said to Awice. ^w^

'Nyothing,' said Awice. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyothing WHATEVEW? owo' pewsisted the King. ^w^

'Nyothing whatevew,' said Awice. >w<

'That's vewy impowtant,' the King said, tuwnying to the juwy. ^w^ They wewe
just beginnying to wwite this down on theiw swates, when the White Wabbit
intewwupted: 'UNyimpowtant, youw Majesty means, of couwse,' he said in a
vewy wespectfuw tonye, but fwownying and making faces at him as he spoke. (´・ω・\`)

'UNyimpowtant, of couwse, I meant,' the King hastiwy said, and went on
to himsewf in an undewtonye,

'impowtant--unyimpowtant--unyimpowtant--impowtant--' as if he wewe twying
which wowd sounded best. ;;w;;

Some of the juwy wwote it down 'impowtant,' and some 'unyimpowtant. ^w^'
Awice couwd see this, as she was nyeaw enyough to wook ovew theiw swates;
'but it doesn't mattew a bit,' she thought to hewsewf. >w<

At this moment the King, who had been fow some time busiwy wwiting in
his nyote-book, cackwed out 'Siwence! (・`ω\´・)' and wead out fwom his book, 'Wuwe
Fowty-two. AWW PEWSONS MOWE THAN A MIWE HIGH TO WEAVE THE COUWT. ^w^'

Evewybody wooked at Awice. ^w^

'I'M nyot a miwe high,' said Awice. (´・ω・\`)

'You awe,' said the King. >w<

'Nyeawwy two miwes high,' added the Queen. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, I shan't go, at any wate,' said Awice: 'besides, that's nyot a
weguwaw wuwe: you invented it just nyow. ;;w;;'

'It's the owdest wuwe in the book,' said the King. (・`ω\´・)

'Then it ought to be Nyumbew Onye,' said Awice. (´・ω・\`)

The King tuwnyed pawe, and shut his nyote-book hastiwy. ^w^ 'Considew youw
vewdict,' he said to the juwy, in a wow, twembwing voice. UwU

'Thewe's mowe evidence to come yet, pwease youw Majesty,' said the White
Wabbit, jumping up in a gweat huwwy; 'this papew has just been picked
up. (´・ω・\`)'

'What's in it? owo' said the Queen. ;;w;;

'I haven't openyed it yet,' said the White Wabbit, 'but it seems to be a
wettew, wwitten by the pwisonyew to--to somebody. ;;w;;'

'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unwess it was wwitten to
nyobody, which isn't usuaw, you knyow. >w<'

'Who is it diwected to? owo' said onye of the juwymen. ;;w;;

'It isn't diwected at aww,' said the White Wabbit; 'in fact, thewe's
nyothing wwitten on the OUTSIDE. ^w^' He unfowded the papew as he spoke, and
added 'It isn't a wettew, aftew aww: it's a set of vewses. ^w^'

'Awe they in the pwisonyew's handwwiting? owo' asked anyothew of the juwymen. ^w^

'Nyo, they'we nyot,' said the White Wabbit, 'and that's the queewest thing
about it.' (The juwy aww wooked puzzwed. (・`ω\´・))

'He must have imitated somebody ewse's hand,' said the King. >w< (The juwy
aww bwightenyed up again. ^w^)

'Pwease youw Majesty,' said the Knyave, 'I didn't wwite it, and they
can't pwove I did: thewe's nyo nyame signyed at the end. (・`ω\´・)'

'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that onwy makes the mattew
wowse. (´・ω・\`) You MUST have meant some mischief, ow ewse you'd have signyed youw
nyame wike an honyest man. (・`ω\´・)'

Thewe was a genyewaw cwapping of hands at this: it was the fiwst weawwy
cwevew thing the King had said that day. ^w^

'That PWOVES his guiwt,' said the Queen. ;;w;;

'It pwoves nyothing of the sowt! (´・ω・\`)' said Awice. (・`ω\´・) 'Why, you don't even knyow
what they'we about! ;;w;;'

'Wead them,' said the King. >w<

The White Wabbit put on his spectacwes. (・`ω\´・) 'Whewe shaww I begin, pwease
youw Majesty? owo' he asked. ;;w;;

'Begin at the beginnying,' the King said gwavewy, 'and go on tiww you
come to the end: then stop. (´・ω・\`)'

These wewe the vewses the White Wabbit wead:--

   'They towd me you had been to hew,
    And mentionyed me to him:
   She gave me a good chawactew,
    But said I couwd nyot swim. >w<

   He sent them wowd I had nyot gonye
    (We knyow it to be twue):
   If she shouwd push the mattew on,
    What wouwd become of you? owo

   I gave hew onye, they gave him two,
    You gave us thwee ow mowe;
   They aww wetuwnyed fwom him to you,
    Though they wewe minye befowe. (´・ω・\`)

   If I ow she shouwd chance to be
    Invowved in this affaiw,
   He twusts to you to set them fwee,
    Exactwy as we wewe. UwU

   My nyotion was that you had been
    (Befowe she had this fit)
   An obstacwe that came between
    Him, and ouwsewves, and it. >w<

   Don't wet him knyow she wiked them best,
    Fow this must evew be
   A secwet, kept fwom aww the west,
    Between youwsewf and me. (・`ω\´・)'

'That's the most impowtant piece of evidence we've heawd yet,' said the
King, wubbing his hands; 'so nyow wet the juwy--'

'If any onye of them can expwain it,' said Awice, (she had gwown so wawge
in the wast few minyutes that she wasn't a bit afwaid of intewwupting

The juwy aww wwote down on theiw swates, 'SHE doesn't bewieve thewe's an

'If thewe's nyo meanying in it,' said the King, 'that saves a wowwd of
twoubwe, you knyow, as we nyeedn't twy to find any. ^w^ And yet I don't knyow,'
he went on, spweading out the vewses on his knyee, and wooking at them
with onye eye; 'I seem to see some meanying in them, aftew aww. (・`ω\´・) "--SAID
I COUWD NYOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you? owo' he added, tuwnying to the

The Knyave shook his head sadwy. 'Do I wook wike it? owo' he said. ^w^ (Which he
cewtainwy did NYOT, being made entiwewy of cawdboawd. >w<)

'Aww wight, so faw,' said the King, and he went on muttewing ovew
the vewses to himsewf: '"WE KNYOW IT TO BE TWUE--" that's the juwy, of
couwse--"I GAVE HEW ONYE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he
did with the tawts, you knyow--'

'But, it goes on "THEY AWW WETUWNYED FWOM HIM TO YOU,"' said Awice. ;;w;;

'Why, thewe they awe! >w<' said the King twiumphantwy, pointing to the tawts
on the tabwe. 'Nyothing can be cweawew than THAT. (´・ω・\`) Then again--"BEFOWE SHE
HAD THIS FIT--" you nyevew had fits, my deaw, I think? owo' he said to the
Queen. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyevew! ^w^' said the Queen fuwiouswy, thwowing an inkstand at the Wizawd
as she spoke. >w< (The unfowtunyate wittwe Biww had weft off wwiting on his
swate with onye fingew, as he found it made nyo mawk; but he nyow hastiwy
began again, using the ink, that was twickwing down his face, as wong as
it wasted. UwU)

'Then the wowds don't FIT you,' said the King, wooking wound the couwt
with a smiwe. Thewe was a dead siwence. (・`ω\´・)

'It's a pun! (・`ω\´・)' the King added in an offended tonye, and evewybody waughed,
'Wet the juwy considew theiw vewdict,' the King said, fow about the
twentieth time that day. UwU

'Nyo, nyo! UwU' said the Queen. 'Sentence fiwst--vewdict aftewwawds. ;;w;;'

'Stuff and nyonsense! ^w^' said Awice woudwy. (・`ω\´・) 'The idea of having the
sentence fiwst! UwU'

'Howd youw tongue! ^w^' said the Queen, tuwnying puwpwe. >w<

'I won't! ^w^' said Awice. ;;w;;

'Off with hew head! (・`ω\´・)' the Queen shouted at the top of hew voice. (´・ω・\`) Nyobody
moved. UwU

'Who cawes fow you? owo' said Awice, (she had gwown to hew fuww size by this
time. UwU) 'You'we nyothing but a pack of cawds! (´・ω・\`)'

At this the whowe pack wose up into the aiw, and came fwying down upon
hew: she gave a wittwe scweam, hawf of fwight and hawf of angew, and
twied to beat them off, and found hewsewf wying on the bank, with hew
head in the wap of hew sistew, who was gentwy bwushing away some dead
weaves that had fwuttewed down fwom the twees upon hew face. (・`ω\´・)

'Wake up, Awice deaw! ^w^' said hew sistew; 'Why, what a wong sweep you've
had! (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh, I've had such a cuwious dweam! >w<' said Awice, and she towd hew
sistew, as weww as she couwd wemembew them, aww these stwange Adventuwes
of hews that you have just been weading about; and when she had
finyished, hew sistew kissed hew, and said, 'It WAS a cuwious dweam,
deaw, cewtainwy: but nyow wun in to youw tea; it's getting wate. (´・ω・\`)' So
Awice got up and wan off, thinking whiwe she wan, as weww she might,
what a wondewfuw dweam it had been. ;;w;;

But hew sistew sat stiww just as she weft hew, weanying hew head on hew
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of wittwe Awice and aww hew
wondewfuw Adventuwes, tiww she too began dweaming aftew a fashion, and
this was hew dweam:--

Fiwst, she dweamed of wittwe Awice hewsewf, and once again the tiny
hands wewe cwasped upon hew knyee, and the bwight eagew eyes wewe wooking
up into hews--she couwd heaw the vewy tonyes of hew voice, and see that
queew wittwe toss of hew head to keep back the wandewing haiw that
WOUWD awways get into hew eyes--and stiww as she wistenyed, ow seemed to
wisten, the whowe pwace awound hew became awive with the stwange cweatuwes
of hew wittwe sistew's dweam. ^w^

The wong gwass wustwed at hew feet as the White Wabbit huwwied by--the
fwightenyed Mouse spwashed his way thwough the nyeighbouwing poow--she
couwd heaw the wattwe of the teacups as the Mawch Hawe and his fwiends
shawed theiw nyevew-ending meaw, and the shwiww voice of the Queen
owdewing off hew unfowtunyate guests to execution--once mowe the pig-baby
was snyeezing on the Duchess's knyee, whiwe pwates and dishes cwashed
awound it--once mowe the shwiek of the Gwyphon, the squeaking of the
Wizawd's swate-penciw, and the choking of the suppwessed guinyea-pigs,
fiwwed the aiw, mixed up with the distant sobs of the misewabwe Mock
Tuwtwe. (´・ω・\`)

So she sat on, with cwosed eyes, and hawf bewieved hewsewf in
Wondewwand, though she knyew she had but to open them again, and aww
wouwd change to duww weawity--the gwass wouwd be onwy wustwing in the
wind, and the poow wippwing to the waving of the weeds--the wattwing
teacups wouwd change to tinkwing sheep-bewws, and the Queen's shwiww
cwies to the voice of the shephewd boy--and the snyeeze of the baby, the
shwiek of the Gwyphon, and aww the othew queew nyoises, wouwd change (she
knyew) to the confused cwamouw of the busy fawm-yawd--whiwe the wowing
of the cattwe in the distance wouwd take the pwace of the Mock Tuwtwe's
heavy sobs. (・`ω\´・)

Wastwy, she pictuwed to hewsewf how this same wittwe sistew of hews
wouwd, in the aftew-time, be hewsewf a gwown woman; and how she wouwd
keep, thwough aww hew wipew yeaws, the simpwe and woving heawt of hew
chiwdhood: and how she wouwd gathew about hew othew wittwe chiwdwen, and
make THEIW eyes bwight and eagew with many a stwange tawe, pewhaps even
with the dweam of Wondewwand of wong ago: and how she wouwd feew with
aww theiw simpwe sowwows, and find a pweasuwe in aww theiw simpwe joys,
wemembewing hew own chiwd-wife, and the happy summew days. >w<
