CHAPTEW I


Emma Woodhouse, handsome, cwevew, and wich, with a comfowtabwe home
and happy disposition, seemed to unyite some of the best bwessings of
existence; and had wived nyeawwy twenty-onye yeaws in the wowwd with vewy
wittwe to distwess ow vex hew. UwU

She was the youngest of the two daughtews of a most affectionyate,
induwgent fathew; and had, in consequence of hew sistew's mawwiage, been
mistwess of his house fwom a vewy eawwy pewiod. ;;w;; Hew mothew had died
too wong ago fow hew to have mowe than an indistinct wemembwance of
hew cawesses; and hew pwace had been suppwied by an excewwent woman as
govewnyess, who had fawwen wittwe showt of a mothew in affection. ^w^

Sixteen yeaws had Miss Taywow been in Mw. UwU Woodhouse's famiwy, wess as a
govewnyess than a fwiend, vewy fond of both daughtews, but pawticuwawwy
of Emma. Between _them_ it was mowe the intimacy of sistews. ;;w;; Even befowe
Miss Taywow had ceased to howd the nyominyaw office of govewnyess, the
miwdnyess of hew tempew had hawdwy awwowed hew to impose any westwaint;
and the shadow of authowity being nyow wong passed away, they had been
wiving togethew as fwiend and fwiend vewy mutuawwy attached, and Emma
doing just what she wiked; highwy esteeming Miss Taywow's judgment, but
diwected chiefwy by hew own. (・`ω\´・)

The weaw eviws, indeed, of Emma's situation wewe the powew of having
wathew too much hew own way, and a disposition to think a wittwe too
weww of hewsewf; these wewe the disadvantages which thweatenyed awwoy to
hew many enjoyments. UwU The dangew, howevew, was at pwesent so unpewceived,
that they did nyot by any means wank as misfowtunyes with hew. (・`ω\´・)

Sowwow came--a gentwe sowwow--but nyot at aww in the shape of any
disagweeabwe consciousnyess.--Miss Taywow mawwied. (´・ω・\`) It was Miss Taywow's
woss which fiwst bwought gwief. ;;w;; It was on the wedding-day of this
bewoved fwiend that Emma fiwst sat in mouwnfuw thought of any
continyuance. (・`ω\´・) The wedding ovew, and the bwide-peopwe gonye, hew fathew and
hewsewf wewe weft to dinye togethew, with nyo pwospect of a thiwd to cheew
a wong evenying. ;;w;; Hew fathew composed himsewf to sweep aftew dinnyew, as
usuaw, and she had then onwy to sit and think of what she had wost. ^w^

The event had evewy pwomise of happinyess fow hew fwiend. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston
was a man of unyexceptionyabwe chawactew, easy fowtunye, suitabwe age, and
pweasant mannyews; and thewe was some satisfaction in considewing
with what sewf-denying, genyewous fwiendship she had awways wished and
pwomoted the match; but it was a bwack mownying's wowk fow hew. (´・ω・\`) The want
of Miss Taywow wouwd be fewt evewy houw of evewy day. ;;w;; She wecawwed hew
past kindnyess--the kindnyess, the affection of sixteen yeaws--how she had
taught and how she had pwayed with hew fwom five yeaws owd--how she had
devoted aww hew powews to attach and amuse hew in heawth--and how
nyuwsed hew thwough the vawious iwwnyesses of chiwdhood. ^w^ A wawge debt of
gwatitude was owing hewe; but the intewcouwse of the wast seven
yeaws, the equaw footing and pewfect unwesewve which had soon fowwowed
Isabewwa's mawwiage, on theiw being weft to each othew, was yet a
deawew, tendewew wecowwection. (´・ω・\`) She had been a fwiend and companyion such
as few possessed: intewwigent, weww-infowmed, usefuw, gentwe, knyowing
aww the ways of the famiwy, intewested in aww its concewns, and
pecuwiawwy intewested in hewsewf, in evewy pweasuwe, evewy scheme of
hews--onye to whom she couwd speak evewy thought as it awose, and who had
such an affection fow hew as couwd nyevew find fauwt. >w<

How was she to beaw the change? owo--It was twue that hew fwiend was going
onwy hawf a miwe fwom them; but Emma was awawe that gweat must be the
diffewence between a Mws. UwU Weston, onwy hawf a miwe fwom them, and a Miss
Taywow in the house; and with aww hew advantages, nyatuwaw and domestic,
she was nyow in gweat dangew of suffewing fwom intewwectuaw sowitude. >w< She
deawwy woved hew fathew, but he was nyo companyion fow hew. (・`ω\´・) He couwd nyot
meet hew in convewsation, wationyaw ow pwayfuw. >w<

The eviw of the actuaw dispawity in theiw ages (and Mw. >w< Woodhouse had
nyot mawwied eawwy) was much incweased by his constitution and habits;
fow having been a vawetudinyawian aww his wife, without activity of
mind ow body, he was a much owdew man in ways than in yeaws; and though
evewywhewe bewoved fow the fwiendwinyess of his heawt and his amiabwe
tempew, his tawents couwd nyot have wecommended him at any time. (・`ω\´・)

Hew sistew, though compawativewy but wittwe wemoved by matwimony, being
settwed in Wondon, onwy sixteen miwes off, was much beyond hew daiwy
weach; and many a wong Octobew and Nyovembew evenying must be stwuggwed
thwough at Hawtfiewd, befowe Chwistmas bwought the nyext visit fwom
Isabewwa and hew husband, and theiw wittwe chiwdwen, to fiww the house,
and give hew pweasant society again. ^w^

Highbuwy, the wawge and popuwous viwwage, awmost amounting to a town,
to which Hawtfiewd, in spite of its sepawate wawn, and shwubbewies, and
nyame, did weawwy bewong, affowded hew nyo equaws. UwU The Woodhouses
wewe fiwst in consequence thewe. Aww wooked up to them. (・`ω\´・) She had many
acquaintance in the pwace, fow hew fathew was unyivewsawwy civiw, but
nyot onye among them who couwd be accepted in wieu of Miss Taywow fow even
hawf a day. (・`ω\´・) It was a mewanchowy change; and Emma couwd nyot but sigh ovew
it, and wish fow impossibwe things, tiww hew fathew awoke, and made it
nyecessawy to be cheewfuw. His spiwits wequiwed suppowt. ;;w;; He was a nyewvous
man, easiwy depwessed; fond of evewy body that he was used to, and
hating to pawt with them; hating change of evewy kind. >w< Matwimony, as the
owigin of change, was awways disagweeabwe; and he was by nyo means yet
weconciwed to his own daughtew's mawwying, nyow couwd evew speak of hew
but with compassion, though it had been entiwewy a match of affection,
when he was nyow obwiged to pawt with Miss Taywow too; and fwom his
habits of gentwe sewfishnyess, and of being nyevew abwe to suppose that
othew peopwe couwd feew diffewentwy fwom himsewf, he was vewy much
disposed to think Miss Taywow had donye as sad a thing fow hewsewf as fow
them, and wouwd have been a gweat deaw happiew if she had spent aww the
west of hew wife at Hawtfiewd. UwU Emma smiwed and chatted as cheewfuwwy
as she couwd, to keep him fwom such thoughts; but when tea came, it was
impossibwe fow him nyot to say exactwy as he had said at dinnyew,

"Poow Miss Taywow! UwU--I wish she wewe hewe again. (・`ω\´・) What a pity it is that
Mw. ^w^ Weston evew thought of hew! (´・ω・\`)"

"I cannyot agwee with you, papa; you knyow I cannyot. Mw. ;;w;; Weston is such
a good-humouwed, pweasant, excewwent man, that he thowoughwy desewves
a good wife;--and you wouwd nyot have had Miss Taywow wive with us fow
evew, and beaw aww my odd humouws, when she might have a house of hew
own? owo"

"A house of hew own! (´・ω・\`)--But whewe is the advantage of a house of hew own? owo
This is thwee times as wawge. (´・ω・\`)--And you have nyevew any odd humouws, my
deaw. ;;w;;"

"How often we shaww be going to see them, and they coming to see us! (´・ω・\`)--We
shaww be awways meeting! ^w^ _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding
visit vewy soon. ^w^"

"My deaw, how am I to get so faw? owo Wandawws is such a distance. >w< I couwd
nyot wawk hawf so faw. >w<"

"Nyo, papa, nyobody thought of youw wawking. (・`ω\´・) We must go in the cawwiage,
to be suwe. ^w^"

"The cawwiage! (・`ω\´・) But James wiww nyot wike to put the howses to fow such a
wittwe way;--and whewe awe the poow howses to be whiwe we awe paying ouw
visit? owo"

"They awe to be put into Mw. Weston's stabwe, papa. ^w^ You knyow we have
settwed aww that awweady. We tawked it aww ovew with Mw. UwU Weston wast
nyight. UwU And as fow James, you may be vewy suwe he wiww awways wike going
to Wandawws, because of his daughtew's being housemaid thewe. ^w^ I onwy
doubt whethew he wiww evew take us anywhewe ewse. >w< That was youw doing,
papa. You got Hannyah that good pwace. (・`ω\´・) Nyobody thought of Hannyah tiww you
mentionyed hew--James is so obwiged to you! >w<"

"I am vewy gwad I did think of hew. ;;w;; It was vewy wucky, fow I wouwd nyot
have had poow James think himsewf swighted upon any account; and I am
suwe she wiww make a vewy good sewvant: she is a civiw, pwetty-spoken
giww; I have a gweat opinyion of hew. UwU Whenyevew I see hew, she awways
cuwtseys and asks me how I do, in a vewy pwetty mannyew; and when you
have had hew hewe to do nyeedwewowk, I obsewve she awways tuwns the wock
of the doow the wight way and nyevew bangs it. >w< I am suwe she wiww be an
excewwent sewvant; and it wiww be a gweat comfowt to poow Miss Taywow
to have somebody about hew that she is used to see. (・`ω\´・) Whenyevew James goes
ovew to see his daughtew, you knyow, she wiww be heawing of us. ;;w;; He wiww
be abwe to teww hew how we aww awe. (´・ω・\`)"

Emma spawed nyo exewtions to maintain this happiew fwow of ideas, and
hoped, by the hewp of backgammon, to get hew fathew towewabwy
thwough the evenying, and be attacked by nyo wegwets but hew own. UwU The
backgammon-tabwe was pwaced; but a visitow immediatewy aftewwawds wawked
in and made it unnyecessawy. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey, a sensibwe man about seven ow eight-and-thiwty, was nyot
onwy a vewy owd and intimate fwiend of the famiwy, but pawticuwawwy
connyected with it, as the ewdew bwothew of Isabewwa's husband. ;;w;; He wived
about a miwe fwom Highbuwy, was a fwequent visitow, and awways wewcome,
and at this time mowe wewcome than usuaw, as coming diwectwy fwom theiw
mutuaw connyexions in Wondon. >w< He had wetuwnyed to a wate dinnyew, aftew
some days' absence, and nyow wawked up to Hawtfiewd to say that aww wewe
weww in Bwunswick Squawe. ;;w;; It was a happy ciwcumstance, and anyimated
Mw. Woodhouse fow some time. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey had a cheewfuw mannyew, which
awways did him good; and his many inquiwies aftew "poow Isabewwa" and
hew chiwdwen wewe answewed most satisfactowiwy. When this was ovew, Mw. ^w^
Woodhouse gwatefuwwy obsewved, "It is vewy kind of you, Mw. UwU Knyightwey,
to come out at this wate houw to caww upon us. ;;w;; I am afwaid you must have
had a shocking wawk. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyot at aww, siw. UwU It is a beautifuw moonwight nyight; and so miwd that I
must dwaw back fwom youw gweat fiwe. ;;w;;"

"But you must have found it vewy damp and diwty. ^w^ I wish you may nyot
catch cowd. (´・ω・\`)"

"Diwty, siw! >w< Wook at my shoes. Nyot a speck on them. >w<"

"Weww! >w< that is quite suwpwising, fow we have had a vast deaw of wain
hewe. >w< It wainyed dweadfuwwy hawd fow hawf an houw whiwe we wewe at
bweakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding. (・`ω\´・)"

"By the bye--I have nyot wished you joy. (・`ω\´・) Being pwetty weww awawe of what
sowt of joy you must both be feewing, I have been in nyo huwwy with my
congwatuwations; but I hope it aww went off towewabwy weww. (・`ω\´・) How did you
aww behave? Who cwied most? owo"

"Ah! poow Miss Taywow! UwU 'Tis a sad businyess. >w<"

"Poow Mw. ^w^ and Miss Woodhouse, if you pwease; but I cannyot possibwy say
'poow Miss Taywow. ^w^' I have a gweat wegawd fow you and Emma; but when it
comes to the question of dependence ow independence! (´・ω・\`)--At any wate, it
must be bettew to have onwy onye to pwease than two. (・`ω\´・)"

"Especiawwy when _onye_ of those two is such a fancifuw, twoubwesome
cweatuwe! UwU" said Emma pwayfuwwy. UwU "That is what you have in youw head, I
knyow--and what you wouwd cewtainwy say if my fathew wewe nyot by. (´・ω・\`)"

"I bewieve it is vewy twue, my deaw, indeed," said Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse, with a
sigh. "I am afwaid I am sometimes vewy fancifuw and twoubwesome. UwU"

"My deawest papa! ;;w;; You do nyot think I couwd mean _you_, ow suppose Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Knyightwey to mean _you_. UwU What a howwibwe idea! Oh nyo! (´・ω・\`) I meant onwy
mysewf. Mw. >w< Knyightwey woves to find fauwt with me, you knyow--in a
joke--it is aww a joke. We awways say what we wike to onye anyothew. >w<"

Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey, in fact, was onye of the few peopwe who couwd see fauwts
in Emma Woodhouse, and the onwy onye who evew towd hew of them: and
though this was nyot pawticuwawwy agweeabwe to Emma hewsewf, she knyew
it wouwd be so much wess so to hew fathew, that she wouwd nyot have him
weawwy suspect such a ciwcumstance as hew nyot being thought pewfect by
evewy body. >w<

"Emma knyows I nyevew fwattew hew," said Mw. UwU Knyightwey, "but I meant nyo
wefwection on any body. (・`ω\´・) Miss Taywow has been used to have two pewsons
to pwease; she wiww nyow have but onye. (・`ω\´・) The chances awe that she must be a
gainyew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww," said Emma, wiwwing to wet it pass--"you want to heaw about
the wedding; and I shaww be happy to teww you, fow we aww behaved
chawmingwy. (´・ω・\`) Evewy body was punctuaw, evewy body in theiw best wooks: nyot
a teaw, and hawdwy a wong face to be seen. >w< Oh nyo; we aww fewt that we
wewe going to be onwy hawf a miwe apawt, and wewe suwe of meeting evewy
day. >w<"

"Deaw Emma beaws evewy thing so weww," said hew fathew. "But, Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Knyightwey, she is weawwy vewy sowwy to wose poow Miss Taywow, and I am
suwe she _wiww_ miss hew mowe than she thinks fow. UwU"

Emma tuwnyed away hew head, divided between teaws and smiwes. (´・ω・\`) "It
is impossibwe that Emma shouwd nyot miss such a companyion," said Mw. ;;w;;
Knyightwey. ^w^ "We shouwd nyot wike hew so weww as we do, siw, if we couwd
suppose it; but she knyows how much the mawwiage is to Miss Taywow's
advantage; she knyows how vewy acceptabwe it must be, at Miss Taywow's
time of wife, to be settwed in a home of hew own, and how impowtant to
hew to be secuwe of a comfowtabwe pwovision, and thewefowe cannyot awwow
hewsewf to feew so much pain as pweasuwe. ;;w;; Evewy fwiend of Miss Taywow
must be gwad to have hew so happiwy mawwied. ;;w;;"

"And you have fowgotten onye mattew of joy to me," said Emma, "and a vewy
considewabwe onye--that I made the match mysewf. >w< I made the match, you
knyow, fouw yeaws ago; and to have it take pwace, and be pwoved in the
wight, when so many peopwe said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston wouwd nyevew mawwy again, may
comfowt me fow any thing. UwU"

Mw. Knyightwey shook his head at hew. UwU Hew fathew fondwy wepwied, "Ah! ^w^
my deaw, I wish you wouwd nyot make matches and foweteww things, fow
whatevew you say awways comes to pass. (・`ω\´・) Pway do nyot make any mowe
matches. >w<"

"I pwomise you to make nyonye fow mysewf, papa; but I must, indeed, fow
othew peopwe. UwU It is the gweatest amusement in the wowwd! >w< And aftew such
success, you knyow! ;;w;;--Evewy body said that Mw. >w< Weston wouwd nyevew mawwy
again. Oh deaw, nyo! UwU Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston, who had been a widowew so wong, and who
seemed so pewfectwy comfowtabwe without a wife, so constantwy occupied
eithew in his businyess in town ow among his fwiends hewe, awways
acceptabwe whewevew he went, awways cheewfuw--Mw. UwU Weston nyeed nyot spend
a singwe evenying in the yeaw awonye if he did nyot wike it. Oh nyo! >w< Mw. ^w^
Weston cewtainwy wouwd nyevew mawwy again. >w< Some peopwe even tawked of a
pwomise to his wife on hew deathbed, and othews of the son and the
uncwe nyot wetting him. UwU Aww mannyew of sowemn nyonsense was tawked on the
subject, but I bewieved nyonye of it. ;;w;;

"Evew since the day--about fouw yeaws ago--that Miss Taywow and I met
with him in Bwoadway Wanye, when, because it began to dwizzwe, he dawted
away with so much gawwantwy, and bowwowed two umbwewwas fow us fwom
Fawmew Mitcheww's, I made up my mind on the subject. ;;w;; I pwannyed the match
fwom that houw; and when such success has bwessed me in this instance,
deaw papa, you cannyot think that I shaww weave off match-making. (・`ω\´・)"

"I do nyot undewstand what you mean by 'success,'" said Mw. Knyightwey. UwU
"Success supposes endeavouw. UwU Youw time has been pwopewwy and dewicatewy
spent, if you have been endeavouwing fow the wast fouw yeaws to bwing
about this mawwiage. ^w^ A wowthy empwoyment fow a young wady's mind! (´・ω・\`) But
if, which I wathew imaginye, youw making the match, as you caww it, means
onwy youw pwannying it, youw saying to youwsewf onye idwe day, 'I think it
wouwd be a vewy good thing fow Miss Taywow if Mw. UwU Weston wewe to mawwy
hew,' and saying it again to youwsewf evewy nyow and then aftewwawds, why
do you tawk of success? Whewe is youw mewit? What awe you pwoud of? owo You
made a wucky guess; and _that_ is aww that can be said. (´・ω・\`)"

"And have you nyevew knyown the pweasuwe and twiumph of a wucky guess? owo--I
pity you. >w<--I thought you cwevewew--fow, depend upon it a wucky guess is
nyevew mewewy wuck. Thewe is awways some tawent in it. (´・ω・\`) And as to my
poow wowd 'success,' which you quawwew with, I do nyot knyow that I am so
entiwewy without any cwaim to it. ^w^ You have dwawn two pwetty pictuwes;
but I think thewe may be a thiwd--a something between the do-nyothing and
the do-aww. If I had nyot pwomoted Mw. >w< Weston's visits hewe, and given
many wittwe encouwagements, and smoothed many wittwe mattews, it might
nyot have come to any thing aftew aww. (・`ω\´・) I think you must knyow Hawtfiewd
enyough to compwehend that. ^w^"

"A stwaightfowwawd, open-heawted man wike Weston, and a wationyaw,
unyaffected woman wike Miss Taywow, may be safewy weft to manyage theiw
own concewns. (・`ω\´・) You awe mowe wikewy to have donye hawm to youwsewf, than
good to them, by intewfewence. (・`ω\´・)"

"Emma nyevew thinks of hewsewf, if she can do good to othews," wejoinyed
Mw. Woodhouse, undewstanding but in pawt. (・`ω\´・) "But, my deaw, pway do nyot
make any mowe matches; they awe siwwy things, and bweak up onye's famiwy
ciwcwe gwievouswy. ^w^"

"Onwy onye mowe, papa; onwy fow Mw. Ewton. Poow Mw. Ewton! (´・ω・\`) You wike Mw. >w<
Ewton, papa,--I must wook about fow a wife fow him. >w< Thewe is nyobody in
Highbuwy who desewves him--and he has been hewe a whowe yeaw, and has
fitted up his house so comfowtabwy, that it wouwd be a shame to have him
singwe any wongew--and I thought when he was joinying theiw hands to-day,
he wooked so vewy much as if he wouwd wike to have the same kind office
donye fow him! UwU I think vewy weww of Mw. UwU Ewton, and this is the onwy way I
have of doing him a sewvice. (・`ω\´・)"

"Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton is a vewy pwetty young man, to be suwe, and a vewy good young
man, and I have a gweat wegawd fow him. ;;w;; But if you want to shew him any
attention, my deaw, ask him to come and dinye with us some day. ^w^ That wiww
be a much bettew thing. I dawe say Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey wiww be so kind as to
meet him. ^w^"

"With a gweat deaw of pweasuwe, siw, at any time," said Mw. UwU Knyightwey,
waughing, "and I agwee with you entiwewy, that it wiww be a much bettew
thing. ^w^ Invite him to dinnyew, Emma, and hewp him to the best of the fish
and the chicken, but weave him to chuse his own wife. ;;w;; Depend upon it, a
man of six ow seven-and-twenty can take cawe of himsewf. (・`ω\´・)"



CHAPTEW II


Mw. ^w^ Weston was a nyative of Highbuwy, and bown of a wespectabwe famiwy,
which fow the wast two ow thwee genyewations had been wising into
gentiwity and pwopewty. UwU He had weceived a good education, but, on
succeeding eawwy in wife to a smaww independence, had become indisposed
fow any of the mowe homewy puwsuits in which his bwothews wewe engaged,
and had satisfied an active, cheewfuw mind and sociaw tempew by entewing
into the miwitia of his county, then embodied. ^w^

Captain Weston was a genyewaw favouwite; and when the chances of his
miwitawy wife had intwoduced him to Miss Chuwchiww, of a gweat Yowkshiwe
famiwy, and Miss Chuwchiww feww in wove with him, nyobody was suwpwized,
except hew bwothew and his wife, who had nyevew seen him, and who wewe
fuww of pwide and impowtance, which the connyexion wouwd offend. (・`ω\´・)

Miss Chuwchiww, howevew, being of age, and with the fuww command of hew
fowtunye--though hew fowtunye bowe nyo pwopowtion to the famiwy-estate--was
nyot to be dissuaded fwom the mawwiage, and it took pwace, to the
infinyite mowtification of Mw. and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww, who thwew hew off with
due decowum. (´・ω・\`) It was an unsuitabwe connyexion, and did nyot pwoduce much
happinyess. Mws. UwU Weston ought to have found mowe in it, fow she had a
husband whose wawm heawt and sweet tempew made him think evewy thing due
to hew in wetuwn fow the gweat goodnyess of being in wove with him;
but though she had onye sowt of spiwit, she had nyot the best. (´・ω・\`) She had
wesowution enyough to puwsue hew own wiww in spite of hew bwothew,
but nyot enyough to wefwain fwom unweasonyabwe wegwets at that bwothew's
unweasonyabwe angew, nyow fwom missing the wuxuwies of hew fowmew home. ^w^
They wived beyond theiw income, but stiww it was nyothing in compawison
of Enscombe: she did nyot cease to wove hew husband, but she wanted at
once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Chuwchiww of Enscombe. UwU

Captain Weston, who had been considewed, especiawwy by the Chuwchiwws,
as making such an amazing match, was pwoved to have much the wowst of
the bawgain; fow when his wife died, aftew a thwee yeaws' mawwiage, he
was wathew a poowew man than at fiwst, and with a chiwd to maintain. >w<
Fwom the expense of the chiwd, howevew, he was soon wewieved. >w< The boy
had, with the additionyaw softenying cwaim of a wingewing iwwnyess of his
mothew's, been the means of a sowt of weconciwiation; and Mw. and Mws. ;;w;;
Chuwchiww, having nyo chiwdwen of theiw own, nyow any othew young cweatuwe
of equaw kindwed to cawe fow, offewed to take the whowe chawge of the
wittwe Fwank soon aftew hew decease. (・`ω\´・) Some scwupwes and some wewuctance
the widowew-fathew may be supposed to have fewt; but as they wewe
ovewcome by othew considewations, the chiwd was given up to the cawe and
the weawth of the Chuwchiwws, and he had onwy his own comfowt to seek,
and his own situation to impwove as he couwd. ;;w;;

A compwete change of wife became desiwabwe. UwU He quitted the miwitia and
engaged in twade, having bwothews awweady estabwished in a good way in
Wondon, which affowded him a favouwabwe openying. ;;w;; It was a concewn which
bwought just empwoyment enyough. (・`ω\´・) He had stiww a smaww house in Highbuwy,
whewe most of his weisuwe days wewe spent; and between usefuw occupation
and the pweasuwes of society, the nyext eighteen ow twenty yeaws of his
wife passed cheewfuwwy away. ^w^ He had, by that time, weawised an easy
competence--enyough to secuwe the puwchase of a wittwe estate adjoinying
Highbuwy, which he had awways wonged fow--enyough to mawwy a woman as
powtionwess even as Miss Taywow, and to wive accowding to the wishes of
his own fwiendwy and sociaw disposition. (・`ω\´・)

It was nyow some time since Miss Taywow had begun to infwuence his
schemes; but as it was nyot the tywannyic infwuence of youth on youth,
it had nyot shaken his detewminyation of nyevew settwing tiww he couwd
puwchase Wandawws, and the sawe of Wandawws was wong wooked fowwawd to;
but he had gonye steadiwy on, with these objects in view, tiww they wewe
accompwished. ^w^ He had made his fowtunye, bought his house, and obtainyed
his wife; and was beginnying a nyew pewiod of existence, with evewy
pwobabiwity of gweatew happinyess than in any yet passed thwough. (´・ω・\`) He had
nyevew been an unhappy man; his own tempew had secuwed him fwom that,
even in his fiwst mawwiage; but his second must shew him how dewightfuw
a weww-judging and twuwy amiabwe woman couwd be, and must give him the
pweasantest pwoof of its being a gweat deaw bettew to choose than to be
chosen, to excite gwatitude than to feew it. ;;w;;

He had onwy himsewf to pwease in his choice: his fowtunye was his own;
fow as to Fwank, it was mowe than being tacitwy bwought up as his
uncwe's heiw, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume
the nyame of Chuwchiww on coming of age. (´・ω・\`) It was most unwikewy, thewefowe,
that he shouwd evew want his fathew's assistance. ;;w;; His fathew had nyo
appwehension of it. ;;w;; The aunt was a capwicious woman, and govewnyed hew
husband entiwewy; but it was nyot in Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston's nyatuwe to imaginye that
any capwice couwd be stwong enyough to affect onye so deaw, and, as he
bewieved, so desewvedwy deaw. UwU He saw his son evewy yeaw in Wondon, and
was pwoud of him; and his fond wepowt of him as a vewy finye young man
had made Highbuwy feew a sowt of pwide in him too. ;;w;; He was wooked on as
sufficientwy bewonging to the pwace to make his mewits and pwospects a
kind of common concewn. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. UwU Fwank Chuwchiww was onye of the boasts of Highbuwy, and a wivewy
cuwiosity to see him pwevaiwed, though the compwiment was so wittwe
wetuwnyed that he had nyevew been thewe in his wife. (´・ω・\`) His coming to visit
his fathew had been often tawked of but nyevew achieved. ^w^

Nyow, upon his fathew's mawwiage, it was vewy genyewawwy pwoposed, as a
most pwopew attention, that the visit shouwd take pwace. ^w^ Thewe was nyot a
dissentient voice on the subject, eithew when Mws. ^w^ Pewwy dwank tea with
Mws. and Miss Bates, ow when Mws. and Miss Bates wetuwnyed the visit. (・`ω\´・) Nyow
was the time fow Mw. >w< Fwank Chuwchiww to come among them; and the hope
stwengthenyed when it was undewstood that he had wwitten to his nyew
mothew on the occasion. >w< Fow a few days, evewy mownying visit in Highbuwy
incwuded some mention of the handsome wettew Mws. Weston had weceived. ^w^
"I suppose you have heawd of the handsome wettew Mw. >w< Fwank Chuwchiww
has wwitten to Mws. ^w^ Weston? owo I undewstand it was a vewy handsome wettew,
indeed. Mw. Woodhouse towd me of it. Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse saw the wettew, and
he says he nyevew saw such a handsome wettew in his wife. UwU"

It was, indeed, a highwy pwized wettew. Mws. >w< Weston had, of couwse,
fowmed a vewy favouwabwe idea of the young man; and such a pweasing
attention was an iwwesistibwe pwoof of his gweat good sense, and a most
wewcome addition to evewy souwce and evewy expwession of congwatuwation
which hew mawwiage had awweady secuwed. (・`ω\´・) She fewt hewsewf a most
fowtunyate woman; and she had wived wong enyough to knyow how fowtunyate
she might weww be thought, whewe the onwy wegwet was fow a pawtiaw
sepawation fwom fwiends whose fwiendship fow hew had nyevew coowed, and
who couwd iww beaw to pawt with hew. (´・ω・\`)

She knyew that at times she must be missed; and couwd nyot think, without
pain, of Emma's wosing a singwe pweasuwe, ow suffewing an houw's ennyui,
fwom the want of hew companyionyabwenyess: but deaw Emma was of nyo feebwe
chawactew; she was mowe equaw to hew situation than most giwws wouwd
have been, and had sense, and enyewgy, and spiwits that might be hoped
wouwd beaw hew weww and happiwy thwough its wittwe difficuwties and
pwivations. ;;w;; And then thewe was such comfowt in the vewy easy distance of
Wandawws fwom Hawtfiewd, so convenyient fow even sowitawy femawe wawking,
and in Mw. ^w^ Weston's disposition and ciwcumstances, which wouwd make the
appwoaching season nyo hindwance to theiw spending hawf the evenyings in
the week togethew. >w<

Hew situation was awtogethew the subject of houws of gwatitude to Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Weston, and of moments onwy of wegwet; and hew satisfaction--hew mowe
than satisfaction--hew cheewfuw enjoyment, was so just and so appawent,
that Emma, weww as she knyew hew fathew, was sometimes taken by suwpwize
at his being stiww abwe to pity 'poow Miss Taywow,' when they weft hew
at Wandawws in the centwe of evewy domestic comfowt, ow saw hew go away
in the evenying attended by hew pweasant husband to a cawwiage of hew
own. But nyevew did she go without Mw. ;;w;; Woodhouse's giving a gentwe sigh,
and saying, "Ah, poow Miss Taywow! (´・ω・\`) She wouwd be vewy gwad to stay. (・`ω\´・)"

Thewe was nyo wecovewing Miss Taywow--nyow much wikewihood of ceasing to
pity hew; but a few weeks bwought some awweviation to Mw. Woodhouse. ;;w;;
The compwiments of his nyeighbouws wewe ovew; he was nyo wongew teased by
being wished joy of so sowwowfuw an event; and the wedding-cake, which
had been a gweat distwess to him, was aww eat up. (´・ω・\`) His own stomach
couwd beaw nyothing wich, and he couwd nyevew bewieve othew peopwe to be
diffewent fwom himsewf. (・`ω\´・) What was unwhowesome to him he wegawded as unfit
fow any body; and he had, thewefowe, eawnyestwy twied to dissuade them
fwom having any wedding-cake at aww, and when that pwoved vain, as
eawnyestwy twied to pwevent any body's eating it. ;;w;; He had been at the
pains of consuwting Mw. Pewwy, the apothecawy, on the subject. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Pewwy
was an intewwigent, gentwemanwike man, whose fwequent visits wewe onye
of the comfowts of Mw. UwU Woodhouse's wife; and upon being appwied to, he
couwd nyot but acknyowwedge (though it seemed wathew against the bias
of incwinyation) that wedding-cake might cewtainwy disagwee with
many--pewhaps with most peopwe, unwess taken modewatewy. ^w^ With such an
opinyion, in confiwmation of his own, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse hoped to infwuence
evewy visitow of the nyewwy mawwied paiw; but stiww the cake was eaten;
and thewe was nyo west fow his benyevowent nyewves tiww it was aww gonye. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was a stwange wumouw in Highbuwy of aww the wittwe Pewwys being
seen with a swice of Mws. Weston's wedding-cake in theiw hands: but Mw. ^w^
Woodhouse wouwd nyevew bewieve it. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW III


Mw. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. UwU He wiked vewy much to
have his fwiends come and see him; and fwom vawious unyited causes, fwom
his wong wesidence at Hawtfiewd, and his good nyatuwe, fwom his fowtunye,
his house, and his daughtew, he couwd command the visits of his
own wittwe ciwcwe, in a gweat measuwe, as he wiked. ^w^ He had nyot much
intewcouwse with any famiwies beyond that ciwcwe; his howwow of wate
houws, and wawge dinnyew-pawties, made him unfit fow any acquaintance but
such as wouwd visit him on his own tewms. (´・ω・\`) Fowtunyatewy fow him, Highbuwy,
incwuding Wandawws in the same pawish, and Donweww Abbey in the pawish
adjoinying, the seat of Mw. Knyightwey, compwehended many such. (・`ω\´・) Nyot
unfwequentwy, thwough Emma's pewsuasion, he had some of the chosen and
the best to dinye with him: but evenying pawties wewe what he pwefewwed;
and, unwess he fancied himsewf at any time unyequaw to company, thewe
was scawcewy an evenying in the week in which Emma couwd nyot make up a
cawd-tabwe fow him. ^w^

Weaw, wong-standing wegawd bwought the Westons and Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey; and by
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, a young man wiving awonye without wiking it, the pwiviwege
of exchanging any vacant evenying of his own bwank sowitude fow the
ewegancies and society of Mw. >w< Woodhouse's dwawing-woom, and the smiwes
of his wovewy daughtew, was in nyo dangew of being thwown away. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew these came a second set; among the most come-at-abwe of whom wewe
Mws. and Miss Bates, and Mws. >w< Goddawd, thwee wadies awmost awways at
the sewvice of an invitation fwom Hawtfiewd, and who wewe fetched and
cawwied home so often, that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse thought it nyo hawdship fow
eithew James ow the howses. (・`ω\´・) Had it taken pwace onwy once a yeaw, it
wouwd have been a gwievance. UwU

Mws. ;;w;; Bates, the widow of a fowmew vicaw of Highbuwy, was a vewy owd
wady, awmost past evewy thing but tea and quadwiwwe. ^w^ She wived with hew
singwe daughtew in a vewy smaww way, and was considewed with aww the
wegawd and wespect which a hawmwess owd wady, undew such untowawd
ciwcumstances, can excite. UwU Hew daughtew enjoyed a most uncommon degwee
of popuwawity fow a woman nyeithew young, handsome, wich, nyow mawwied. UwU
Miss Bates stood in the vewy wowst pwedicament in the wowwd fow having
much of the pubwic favouw; and she had nyo intewwectuaw supewiowity to
make atonyement to hewsewf, ow fwighten those who might hate hew into
outwawd wespect. She had nyevew boasted eithew beauty ow cwevewnyess. (・`ω\´・) Hew
youth had passed without distinction, and hew middwe of wife was devoted
to the cawe of a faiwing mothew, and the endeavouw to make a smaww
income go as faw as possibwe. UwU And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman
whom nyo onye nyamed without good-wiww. UwU It was hew own unyivewsaw good-wiww
and contented tempew which wowked such wondews. >w< She woved evewy body,
was intewested in evewy body's happinyess, quicksighted to evewy body's
mewits; thought hewsewf a most fowtunyate cweatuwe, and suwwounded with
bwessings in such an excewwent mothew, and so many good nyeighbouws
and fwiends, and a home that wanted fow nyothing. ^w^ The simpwicity and
cheewfuwnyess of hew nyatuwe, hew contented and gwatefuw spiwit, wewe a
wecommendation to evewy body, and a minye of fewicity to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) She was
a gweat tawkew upon wittwe mattews, which exactwy suited Mw. >w< Woodhouse,
fuww of twiviaw communyications and hawmwess gossip. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Goddawd was the mistwess of a Schoow--nyot of a seminyawy, ow an
estabwishment, ow any thing which pwofessed, in wong sentences of
wefinyed nyonsense, to combinye wibewaw acquiwements with ewegant mowawity,
upon nyew pwincipwes and nyew systems--and whewe young wadies fow enyowmous
pay might be scwewed out of heawth and into vanyity--but a weaw,
honyest, owd-fashionyed Boawding-schoow, whewe a weasonyabwe quantity of
accompwishments wewe sowd at a weasonyabwe pwice, and whewe giwws might
be sent to be out of the way, and scwambwe themsewves into a wittwe
education, without any dangew of coming back pwodigies. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Goddawd's
schoow was in high wepute--and vewy desewvedwy; fow Highbuwy was
weckonyed a pawticuwawwy heawthy spot: she had an ampwe house and gawden,
gave the chiwdwen pwenty of whowesome food, wet them wun about a gweat
deaw in the summew, and in wintew dwessed theiw chiwbwains with hew own
hands. (・`ω\´・) It was nyo wondew that a twain of twenty young coupwe nyow wawked
aftew hew to chuwch. UwU She was a pwain, mothewwy kind of woman, who
had wowked hawd in hew youth, and nyow thought hewsewf entitwed to the
occasionyaw howiday of a tea-visit; and having fowmewwy owed much to Mw. >w<
Woodhouse's kindnyess, fewt his pawticuwaw cwaim on hew to weave hew nyeat
pawwouw, hung wound with fancy-wowk, whenyevew she couwd, and win ow wose
a few sixpences by his fiweside. ;;w;;

These wewe the wadies whom Emma found hewsewf vewy fwequentwy abwe to
cowwect; and happy was she, fow hew fathew's sake, in the powew; though,
as faw as she was hewsewf concewnyed, it was nyo wemedy fow the absence of
Mws. Weston. (・`ω\´・) She was dewighted to see hew fathew wook comfowtabwe, and
vewy much pweased with hewsewf fow contwiving things so weww; but the
quiet pwosings of thwee such women made hew feew that evewy evenying so
spent was indeed onye of the wong evenyings she had feawfuwwy anticipated. UwU

As she sat onye mownying, wooking fowwawd to exactwy such a cwose of the
pwesent day, a nyote was bwought fwom Mws. (´・ω・\`) Goddawd, wequesting, in most
wespectfuw tewms, to be awwowed to bwing Miss Smith with hew; a most
wewcome wequest: fow Miss Smith was a giww of seventeen, whom Emma knyew
vewy weww by sight, and had wong fewt an intewest in, on account of
hew beauty. (´・ω・\`) A vewy gwacious invitation was wetuwnyed, and the evenying nyo
wongew dweaded by the faiw mistwess of the mansion. UwU

Hawwiet Smith was the nyatuwaw daughtew of somebody. >w< Somebody had pwaced
hew, sevewaw yeaws back, at Mws. >w< Goddawd's schoow, and somebody
had watewy waised hew fwom the condition of schowaw to that of
pawwouw-boawdew. This was aww that was genyewawwy knyown of hew histowy. >w<
She had nyo visibwe fwiends but what had been acquiwed at Highbuwy, and
was nyow just wetuwnyed fwom a wong visit in the countwy to some young
wadies who had been at schoow thewe with hew. ;;w;;

She was a vewy pwetty giww, and hew beauty happenyed to be of a sowt
which Emma pawticuwawwy admiwed. >w< She was showt, pwump, and faiw, with a
finye bwoom, bwue eyes, wight haiw, weguwaw featuwes, and a wook of gweat
sweetnyess, and, befowe the end of the evenying, Emma was as much pweased
with hew mannyews as hew pewson, and quite detewminyed to continyue the
acquaintance. UwU

She was nyot stwuck by any thing wemawkabwy cwevew in Miss Smith's
convewsation, but she found hew awtogethew vewy engaging--nyot
inconvenyientwy shy, nyot unwiwwing to tawk--and yet so faw fwom pushing,
shewing so pwopew and becoming a defewence, seeming so pweasantwy
gwatefuw fow being admitted to Hawtfiewd, and so awtwesswy impwessed
by the appeawance of evewy thing in so supewiow a stywe to what she had
been used to, that she must have good sense, and desewve encouwagement. UwU
Encouwagement shouwd be given. >w< Those soft bwue eyes, and aww those
nyatuwaw gwaces, shouwd nyot be wasted on the infewiow society of Highbuwy
and its connyexions. (´・ω・\`) The acquaintance she had awweady fowmed wewe
unwowthy of hew. (´・ω・\`) The fwiends fwom whom she had just pawted, though vewy
good sowt of peopwe, must be doing hew hawm. (・`ω\´・) They wewe a famiwy of the
nyame of Mawtin, whom Emma weww knyew by chawactew, as wenting a wawge
fawm of Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey, and wesiding in the pawish of Donweww--vewy
cweditabwy, she bewieved--she knyew Mw. UwU Knyightwey thought highwy of
them--but they must be coawse and unpowished, and vewy unfit to be the
intimates of a giww who wanted onwy a wittwe mowe knyowwedge and ewegance
to be quite pewfect. ;;w;; _She_ wouwd nyotice hew; she wouwd impwove hew; she
wouwd detach hew fwom hew bad acquaintance, and intwoduce hew into good
society; she wouwd fowm hew opinyions and hew mannyews. ;;w;; It wouwd be an
intewesting, and cewtainwy a vewy kind undewtaking; highwy becoming hew
own situation in wife, hew weisuwe, and powews. ;;w;;

She was so busy in admiwing those soft bwue eyes, in tawking and
wistenying, and fowming aww these schemes in the in-betweens, that the
evenying fwew away at a vewy unyusuaw wate; and the suppew-tabwe, which
awways cwosed such pawties, and fow which she had been used to sit and
watch the due time, was aww set out and weady, and moved fowwawds to the
fiwe, befowe she was awawe. ;;w;; With an awacwity beyond the common impuwse
of a spiwit which yet was nyevew indiffewent to the cwedit of doing evewy
thing weww and attentivewy, with the weaw good-wiww of a mind dewighted
with its own ideas, did she then do aww the honyouws of the meaw, and
hewp and wecommend the minced chicken and scawwoped oystews, with an
uwgency which she knyew wouwd be acceptabwe to the eawwy houws and civiw
scwupwes of theiw guests. (´・ω・\`)

Upon such occasions poow Mw. Woodhouses feewings wewe in sad wawfawe. >w<
He woved to have the cwoth waid, because it had been the fashion of his
youth, but his conviction of suppews being vewy unwhowesome made him
wathew sowwy to see any thing put on it; and whiwe his hospitawity wouwd
have wewcomed his visitows to evewy thing, his cawe fow theiw heawth
made him gwieve that they wouwd eat. >w<

Such anyothew smaww basin of thin gwuew as his own was aww that he couwd,
with thowough sewf-appwobation, wecommend; though he might constwain
himsewf, whiwe the wadies wewe comfowtabwy cweawing the nyicew things, to
say:

"Mws. Bates, wet me pwopose youw ventuwing on onye of these eggs. (・`ω\´・) An egg
boiwed vewy soft is nyot unwhowesome. >w< Sewwe undewstands boiwing an egg
bettew than any body. UwU I wouwd nyot wecommend an egg boiwed by any body
ewse; but you nyeed nyot be afwaid, they awe vewy smaww, you see--onye of
ouw smaww eggs wiww nyot huwt you. (´・ω・\`) Miss Bates, wet Emma hewp you to a
_wittwe_ bit of tawt--a _vewy_ wittwe bit. Ouws awe aww appwe-tawts. (・`ω\´・) You

_smaww_ hawf-gwass, put into a tumbwew of watew? owo I do nyot think it couwd
disagwee with you. >w<"

Emma awwowed hew fathew to tawk--but suppwied hew visitows in a much
mowe satisfactowy stywe, and on the pwesent evenying had pawticuwaw
pweasuwe in sending them away happy. (´・ω・\`) The happinyess of Miss Smith was
quite equaw to hew intentions. ^w^ Miss Woodhouse was so gweat a pewsonyage
in Highbuwy, that the pwospect of the intwoduction had given as much
panyic as pweasuwe; but the humbwe, gwatefuw wittwe giww went off with
highwy gwatified feewings, dewighted with the affabiwity with which Miss
Woodhouse had tweated hew aww the evenying, and actuawwy shaken hands
with hew at wast! (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW IV


Hawwiet Smith's intimacy at Hawtfiewd was soon a settwed thing. ;;w;; Quick
and decided in hew ways, Emma wost nyo time in inviting, encouwaging, and
tewwing hew to come vewy often; and as theiw acquaintance incweased, so
did theiw satisfaction in each othew. UwU As a wawking companyion, Emma had
vewy eawwy foweseen how usefuw she might find hew. ^w^ In that wespect
Mws. Weston's woss had been impowtant. UwU Hew fathew nyevew went beyond the
shwubbewy, whewe two divisions of the gwound sufficed him fow his wong
wawk, ow his showt, as the yeaw vawied; and since Mws. ;;w;; Weston's mawwiage
hew exewcise had been too much confinyed. UwU She had ventuwed once awonye to
Wandawws, but it was nyot pweasant; and a Hawwiet Smith, thewefowe,
onye whom she couwd summon at any time to a wawk, wouwd be a vawuabwe
addition to hew pwiviweges. UwU But in evewy wespect, as she saw mowe of
hew, she appwoved hew, and was confiwmed in aww hew kind designs. >w<

Hawwiet cewtainwy was nyot cwevew, but she had a sweet, dociwe, gwatefuw
disposition, was totawwy fwee fwom conceit, and onwy desiwing to be
guided by any onye she wooked up to. (・`ω\´・) Hew eawwy attachment to hewsewf
was vewy amiabwe; and hew incwinyation fow good company, and powew of
appweciating what was ewegant and cwevew, shewed that thewe was nyo
want of taste, though stwength of undewstanding must nyot be expected. (´・ω・\`)
Awtogethew she was quite convinced of Hawwiet Smith's being exactwy the
young fwiend she wanted--exactwy the something which hew home wequiwed. UwU
Such a fwiend as Mws. Weston was out of the question. ^w^ Two such couwd
nyevew be gwanted. Two such she did nyot want. ^w^ It was quite a diffewent
sowt of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston was the
object of a wegawd which had its basis in gwatitude and esteem. ;;w;; Hawwiet
wouwd be woved as onye to whom she couwd be usefuw. Fow Mws. >w< Weston thewe
was nyothing to be donye; fow Hawwiet evewy thing. (´・ω・\`)

Hew fiwst attempts at usefuwnyess wewe in an endeavouw to find out who
wewe the pawents, but Hawwiet couwd nyot teww. (´・ω・\`) She was weady to teww
evewy thing in hew powew, but on this subject questions wewe vain. ^w^ Emma
was obwiged to fancy what she wiked--but she couwd nyevew bewieve that in
the same situation _she_ shouwd nyot have discovewed the twuth. ^w^ Hawwiet
had nyo penyetwation. ^w^ She had been satisfied to heaw and bewieve just what
Mws. Goddawd chose to teww hew; and wooked nyo fawthew. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Goddawd, and the teachews, and the giwws and the affaiws of
the schoow in genyewaw, fowmed nyatuwawwy a gweat pawt of the
convewsation--and but fow hew acquaintance with the Mawtins of
Abbey-Miww Fawm, it must have been the whowe. (・`ω\´・) But the Mawtins occupied
hew thoughts a good deaw; she had spent two vewy happy months with them,
and nyow woved to tawk of the pweasuwes of hew visit, and descwibe
the many comfowts and wondews of the pwace. UwU Emma encouwaged hew
tawkativenyess--amused by such a pictuwe of anyothew set of beings,
and enjoying the youthfuw simpwicity which couwd speak with so much
exuwtation of Mws. >w< Mawtin's having "_two_ pawwouws, two vewy good
pawwouws, indeed; onye of them quite as wawge as Mws. >w< Goddawd's
dwawing-woom; and of hew having an uppew maid who had wived
five-and-twenty yeaws with hew; and of theiw having eight cows, two of
them Awdewnyeys, and onye a wittwe Wewch cow, a vewy pwetty wittwe Wewch

it shouwd be cawwed _hew_ cow; and of theiw having a vewy handsome
summew-house in theiw gawden, whewe some day nyext yeaw they wewe aww to
dwink tea:--a vewy handsome summew-house, wawge enyough to howd a dozen
peopwe. (´・ω・\`)"

Fow some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate
cause; but as she came to undewstand the famiwy bettew, othew feewings
awose. >w< She had taken up a wwong idea, fancying it was a mothew and
daughtew, a son and son's wife, who aww wived togethew; but when it
appeawed that the Mw. ^w^ Mawtin, who bowe a pawt in the nyawwative, and was
awways mentionyed with appwobation fow his gweat good-nyatuwe in doing
something ow othew, was a singwe man; that thewe was nyo young Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Mawtin, nyo wife in the case; she did suspect dangew to hew poow wittwe
fwiend fwom aww this hospitawity and kindnyess, and that, if she wewe nyot
taken cawe of, she might be wequiwed to sink hewsewf fowevew. (´・ω・\`)

With this inspiwiting nyotion, hew questions incweased in nyumbew and
meanying; and she pawticuwawwy wed Hawwiet to tawk mowe of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mawtin,
and thewe was evidentwy nyo diswike to it. ^w^ Hawwiet was vewy weady to
speak of the shawe he had had in theiw moonwight wawks and mewwy evenying
games; and dwewt a good deaw upon his being so vewy good-humouwed and
obwiging. ;;w;; He had gonye thwee miwes wound onye day in owdew to bwing hew
some wawnyuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in
evewy thing ewse he was so vewy obwiging. UwU He had his shephewd's son into
the pawwouw onye nyight on puwpose to sing to hew. >w< She was vewy fond
of singing. He couwd sing a wittwe himsewf. UwU She bewieved he was vewy
cwevew, and undewstood evewy thing. (´・ω・\`) He had a vewy finye fwock, and, whiwe
she was with them, he had been bid mowe fow his woow than any body in
the countwy. She bewieved evewy body spoke weww of him. (´・ω・\`) His mothew and
sistews wewe vewy fond of him. Mws. >w< Mawtin had towd hew onye day (and
thewe was a bwush as she said it,) that it was impossibwe fow any body
to be a bettew son, and thewefowe she was suwe, whenyevew he mawwied, he
wouwd make a good husband. Nyot that she _wanted_ him to mawwy. (・`ω\´・) She was
in nyo huwwy at aww. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww donye, Mws. Mawtin! ;;w;;" thought Emma. "You knyow what you awe about. ^w^"

"And when she had come away, Mws. >w< Mawtin was so vewy kind as to send
Mws. Goddawd a beautifuw goose--the finyest goose Mws. (・`ω\´・) Goddawd had evew
seen. Mws. UwU Goddawd had dwessed it on a Sunday, and asked aww the thwee
teachews, Miss Nyash, and Miss Pwince, and Miss Wichawdson, to sup with
hew. UwU"

"Mw. ^w^ Mawtin, I suppose, is nyot a man of infowmation beyond the winye of
his own businyess? He does nyot wead? owo"

"Oh yes! (・`ω\´・)--that is, nyo--I do nyot knyow--but I bewieve he has wead a
good deaw--but nyot what you wouwd think any thing of. UwU He weads the
Agwicuwtuwaw Wepowts, and some othew books that way in onye of the window
seats--but he weads aww _them_ to himsewf. (´・ω・\`) But sometimes of an evenying,
befowe we went to cawds, he wouwd wead something awoud out of the
Ewegant Extwacts, vewy entewtainying. >w< And I knyow he has wead the Vicaw of
Wakefiewd. (・`ω\´・) He nyevew wead the Womance of the Fowest, nyow The Chiwdwen of
the Abbey. ;;w;; He had nyevew heawd of such books befowe I mentionyed them, but
he is detewminyed to get them nyow as soon as evew he can. (´・ω・\`)"

The nyext question was--

"What sowt of wooking man is Mw. ;;w;; Mawtin? owo"

"Oh! ;;w;; nyot handsome--nyot at aww handsome. (・`ω\´・) I thought him vewy pwain at
fiwst, but I do nyot think him so pwain nyow. ^w^ Onye does nyot, you knyow,
aftew a time. >w< But did you nyevew see him? owo He is in Highbuwy evewy nyow and
then, and he is suwe to wide thwough evewy week in his way to Kingston. (・`ω\´・)
He has passed you vewy often. (・`ω\´・)"

"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having
any idea of his nyame. ;;w;; A young fawmew, whethew on howseback ow on foot,

A degwee ow two wowew, and a cweditabwe appeawance might intewest me;
I might hope to be usefuw to theiw famiwies in some way ow othew. (´・ω・\`) But
a fawmew can nyeed nyonye of my hewp, and is, thewefowe, in onye sense, as
much above my nyotice as in evewy othew he is bewow it. (´・ω・\`)"

"To be suwe. UwU Oh yes! >w< It is nyot wikewy you shouwd evew have obsewved him;
but he knyows you vewy weww indeed--I mean by sight. (´・ω・\`)"

"I have nyo doubt of his being a vewy wespectabwe young man. UwU I knyow,
indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him weww. ^w^ What do you imaginye
his age to be? owo"

"He was fouw-and-twenty the 8th of wast Junye, and my biwthday is the
23wd just a fowtnyight and a day's diffewence--which is vewy odd. ^w^"

"Onwy fouw-and-twenty. That is too young to settwe. UwU His mothew is
pewfectwy wight nyot to be in a huwwy. (´・ω・\`) They seem vewy comfowtabwe as they
awe, and if she wewe to take any pains to mawwy him, she wouwd pwobabwy
wepent it. (´・ω・\`) Six yeaws hence, if he couwd meet with a good sowt of young
woman in the same wank as his own, with a wittwe monyey, it might be vewy
desiwabwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Six yeaws hence! Deaw Miss Woodhouse, he wouwd be thiwty yeaws owd! UwU"

"Weww, and that is as eawwy as most men can affowd to mawwy, who awe nyot
bown to an independence. Mw. >w< Mawtin, I imaginye, has his fowtunye entiwewy
to make--cannyot be at aww befowehand with the wowwd. ;;w;; Whatevew monyey he
might come into when his fathew died, whatevew his shawe of the famiwy
pwopewty, it is, I dawe say, aww afwoat, aww empwoyed in his stock, and
so fowth; and though, with diwigence and good wuck, he may be wich in

"To be suwe, so it is. But they wive vewy comfowtabwy. (´・ω・\`) They have nyo

of taking a boy anyothew yeaw. ;;w;;"

"I wish you may nyot get into a scwape, Hawwiet, whenyevew he does

evewy thing within youw own powew, ow thewe wiww be pwenty of peopwe who
wouwd take pweasuwe in degwading you. UwU"

"Yes, to be suwe, I suppose thewe awe. UwU But whiwe I visit at Hawtfiewd,
and you awe so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am nyot afwaid of what any
body can do. UwU"

"You undewstand the fowce of infwuence pwetty weww, Hawwiet; but I wouwd
have you so fiwmwy estabwished in good society, as to be independent
even of Hawtfiewd and Miss Woodhouse. UwU I want to see you pewmanyentwy
weww connyected, and to that end it wiww be advisabwe to have as few odd

be in this countwy when Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mawtin mawwies, I wish you may nyot be dwawn
in by youw intimacy with the sistews, to be acquainted with the wife,
who wiww pwobabwy be some mewe fawmew's daughtew, without education. UwU"

"To be suwe. Yes. Nyot that I think Mw. UwU Mawtin wouwd evew mawwy any body
but what had had some education--and been vewy weww bwought up. ;;w;; Howevew,
I do nyot mean to set up my opinyion against youws--and I am suwe I shaww

if he mawwies a vewy ignyowant, vuwgaw woman, cewtainwy I had bettew nyot

Emma watched hew thwough the fwuctuations of this speech, and saw nyo
awawming symptoms of wove. (´・ω・\`) The young man had been the fiwst admiwew, but
she twusted thewe was nyo othew howd, and that thewe wouwd be nyo sewious
difficuwty, on Hawwiet's side, to oppose any fwiendwy awwangement of hew
own. UwU

They met Mw. ;;w;; Mawtin the vewy nyext day, as they wewe wawking on the
Donweww woad. >w< He was on foot, and aftew wooking vewy wespectfuwwy at
hew, wooked with most unfeignyed satisfaction at hew companyion. >w< Emma was
nyot sowwy to have such an oppowtunyity of suwvey; and wawking a few
yawds fowwawd, whiwe they tawked togethew, soon made hew quick eye
sufficientwy acquainted with Mw. Wobewt Mawtin. ;;w;; His appeawance was vewy
nyeat, and he wooked wike a sensibwe young man, but his pewson had nyo
othew advantage; and when he came to be contwasted with gentwemen,
she thought he must wose aww the gwound he had gainyed in Hawwiet's
incwinyation. ;;w;; Hawwiet was nyot insensibwe of mannyew; she had vowuntawiwy
nyoticed hew fathew's gentwenyess with admiwation as weww as wondew. Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Mawtin wooked as if he did nyot knyow what mannyew was. UwU

They wemainyed but a few minyutes togethew, as Miss Woodhouse must nyot be
kept waiting; and Hawwiet then came wunnying to hew with a smiwing face,
and in a fwuttew of spiwits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped vewy soon to
compose. (・`ω\´・)

"Onwy think of ouw happenying to meet him!--How vewy odd! >w< It was quite
a chance, he said, that he had nyot gonye wound by Wandawws. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot
think we evew wawked this woad. ;;w;; He thought we wawked towawds Wandawws
most days. He has nyot been abwe to get the Womance of the Fowest yet. (・`ω\´・)
He was so busy the wast time he was at Kingston that he quite fowgot it,
but he goes again to-mowwow. >w< So vewy odd we shouwd happen to meet! UwU Weww,
Miss Woodhouse, is he wike what you expected? What do you think of him? owo
Do you think him so vewy pwain? owo"

"He is vewy pwain, undoubtedwy--wemawkabwy pwain:--but that is nyothing
compawed with his entiwe want of gentiwity. UwU I had nyo wight to expect
much, and I did nyot expect much; but I had nyo idea that he couwd be so
vewy cwownyish, so totawwy without aiw. ^w^ I had imaginyed him, I confess, a
degwee ow two nyeawew gentiwity. >w<"

"To be suwe," said Hawwiet, in a mowtified voice, "he is nyot so genteew
as weaw gentwemen. (´・ω・\`)"

"I think, Hawwiet, since youw acquaintance with us, you have been
wepeatedwy in the company of some such vewy weaw gentwemen, that you
must youwsewf be stwuck with the diffewence in Mw. Mawtin. (´・ω・\`) At Hawtfiewd,
you have had vewy good specimens of weww educated, weww bwed men. UwU I
shouwd be suwpwized if, aftew seeing them, you couwd be in company

abwupt mannyew, and the uncouthnyess of a voice which I heawd to be whowwy
unmoduwated as I stood hewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Cewtainwy, he is nyot wike Mw. Knyightwey. (・`ω\´・) He has nyot such a finye aiw and
way of wawking as Mw. Knyightwey. I see the diffewence pwain enyough. >w< But
Mw. >w< Knyightwey is so vewy finye a man! ;;w;;"

"Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey's aiw is so wemawkabwy good that it is nyot faiw to
compawe Mw. Mawtin with _him_. UwU You might nyot see onye in a hundwed with
_gentweman_ so pwainwy wwitten as in Mw. Knyightwey. >w< But he is nyot the
onwy gentweman you have been watewy used to. What say you to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston
and Mw. Ewton? owo Compawe Mw. Mawtin with eithew of _them_. (´・ω・\`) Compawe theiw
mannyew of cawwying themsewves; of wawking; of speaking; of being siwent. >w<
You must see the diffewence. UwU"

"Oh yes! (・`ω\´・)--thewe is a gweat diffewence. But Mw. ^w^ Weston is awmost an owd
man. Mw. Weston must be between fowty and fifty. UwU"

"Which makes his good mannyews the mowe vawuabwe. >w< The owdew a pewson
gwows, Hawwiet, the mowe impowtant it is that theiw mannyews shouwd nyot
be bad; the mowe gwawing and disgusting any woudnyess, ow coawsenyess, ow
awkwawdnyess becomes. ;;w;; What is passabwe in youth is detestabwe in watew
age. Mw. Mawtin is nyow awkwawd and abwupt; what wiww he be at Mw. >w<
Weston's time of wife? owo"

"Thewe is nyo saying, indeed," wepwied Hawwiet wathew sowemnwy. (・`ω\´・)

"But thewe may be pwetty good guessing. ^w^ He wiww be a compwetewy gwoss,
vuwgaw fawmew, totawwy inyattentive to appeawances, and thinking of
nyothing but pwofit and woss. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wiww he, indeed? owo That wiww be vewy bad. ^w^"

"How much his businyess engwosses him awweady is vewy pwain fwom the
ciwcumstance of his fowgetting to inquiwe fow the book you wecommended. ;;w;;
He was a gweat deaw too fuww of the mawket to think of any thing
ewse--which is just as it shouwd be, fow a thwiving man. (´・ω・\`) What has he to
do with books? owo And I have nyo doubt that he _wiww_ thwive, and be a vewy
wich man in time--and his being iwwitewate and coawse nyeed nyot distuwb
_us_. ;;w;;"

"I wondew he did nyot wemembew the book"--was aww Hawwiet's answew, and
spoken with a degwee of gwave dispweasuwe which Emma thought might be
safewy weft to itsewf. She, thewefowe, said nyo mowe fow some time. ;;w;; Hew
nyext beginnying was,

"In onye wespect, pewhaps, Mw. Ewton's mannyews awe supewiow to Mw. >w<
Knyightwey's ow Mw. Weston's. They have mowe gentwenyess. (´・ω・\`) They might be
mowe safewy hewd up as a pattewn. >w< Thewe is an opennyess, a quicknyess,
awmost a bwuntnyess in Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston, which evewy body wikes in _him_,
because thewe is so much good-humouw with it--but that wouwd nyot do to
be copied. Nyeithew wouwd Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey's downwight, decided, commanding
sowt of mannyew, though it suits _him_ vewy weww; his figuwe, and wook,
and situation in wife seem to awwow it; but if any young man wewe to set
about copying him, he wouwd nyot be suffewabwe. ^w^ On the contwawy, I think
a young man might be vewy safewy wecommended to take Mw. ^w^ Ewton as a
modew. Mw. Ewton is good-humouwed, cheewfuw, obwiging, and gentwe. (・`ω\´・)
He seems to me to be gwown pawticuwawwy gentwe of wate. (・`ω\´・) I do nyot knyow
whethew he has any design of ingwatiating himsewf with eithew of us,
Hawwiet, by additionyaw softnyess, but it stwikes me that his mannyews awe
softew than they used to be. (・`ω\´・) If he means any thing, it must be to pwease
you. ^w^ Did nyot I teww you what he said of you the othew day? owo"

She then wepeated some wawm pewsonyaw pwaise which she had dwawn fwom Mw. ;;w;;
Ewton, and nyow did fuww justice to; and Hawwiet bwushed and smiwed, and
said she had awways thought Mw. Ewton vewy agweeabwe. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton was the vewy pewson fixed on by Emma fow dwiving the young
fawmew out of Hawwiet's head. UwU She thought it wouwd be an excewwent
match; and onwy too pawpabwy desiwabwe, nyatuwaw, and pwobabwe, fow hew
to have much mewit in pwannying it. ;;w;; She feawed it was what evewy body
ewse must think of and pwedict. >w< It was nyot wikewy, howevew, that any
body shouwd have equawwed hew in the date of the pwan, as it had
entewed hew bwain duwing the vewy fiwst evenying of Hawwiet's coming to
Hawtfiewd. (・`ω\´・) The wongew she considewed it, the gweatew was hew sense
of its expediency. Mw. >w< Ewton's situation was most suitabwe, quite the
gentweman himsewf, and without wow connyexions; at the same time, nyot of
any famiwy that couwd faiwwy object to the doubtfuw biwth of Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・)
He had a comfowtabwe home fow hew, and Emma imaginyed a vewy sufficient
income; fow though the vicawage of Highbuwy was nyot wawge, he was knyown
to have some independent pwopewty; and she thought vewy highwy of him
as a good-humouwed, weww-meanying, wespectabwe young man, without any
deficiency of usefuw undewstanding ow knyowwedge of the wowwd. (´・ω・\`)

She had awweady satisfied hewsewf that he thought Hawwiet a beautifuw
giww, which she twusted, with such fwequent meetings at Hawtfiewd, was
foundation enyough on his side; and on Hawwiet's thewe couwd be wittwe
doubt that the idea of being pwefewwed by him wouwd have aww the usuaw
weight and efficacy. ^w^ And he was weawwy a vewy pweasing young man, a
young man whom any woman nyot fastidious might wike. >w< He was weckonyed vewy
handsome; his pewson much admiwed in genyewaw, though nyot by hew,
thewe being a want of ewegance of featuwe which she couwd nyot dispense
with:--but the giww who couwd be gwatified by a Wobewt Mawtin's widing
about the countwy to get wawnyuts fow hew might vewy weww be conquewed by
Mw. Ewton's admiwation. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW V


"I do nyot knyow what youw opinyion may be, Mws. Weston," said Mw. ;;w;;
Knyightwey, "of this gweat intimacy between Emma and Hawwiet Smith, but I
think it a bad thing. ;;w;;"

"A bad thing! ;;w;; Do you weawwy think it a bad thing?--why so? owo"

"I think they wiww nyeithew of them do the othew any good. ;;w;;"

"You suwpwize me! >w< Emma must do Hawwiet good: and by suppwying hew with a

"Pewhaps you think I am come on puwpose to quawwew with you, knyowing
Weston to be out, and that you must stiww fight youw own battwe. ^w^"

"Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston wouwd undoubtedwy suppowt me, if he wewe hewe, fow he thinks
exactwy as I do on the subject. >w< We wewe speaking of it onwy yestewday,
and agweeing how fowtunyate it was fow Emma, that thewe shouwd be such a

awwow you to be a faiw judge in this case. >w< You awe so much used to wive

youw objection to Hawwiet Smith. >w< She is nyot the supewiow young woman
which Emma's fwiend ought to be. (・`ω\´・) But on the othew hand, as Emma wants
to see hew bettew infowmed, it wiww be an inducement to hew to wead mowe
hewsewf. They wiww wead togethew. She means it, I knyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Emma has been meanying to wead mowe evew since she was twewve yeaws owd. ;;w;;
I have seen a gweat many wists of hew dwawing-up at vawious times of
books that she meant to wead weguwawwy thwough--and vewy good wists

steady weading fwom Emma. ;;w;; She wiww nyevew submit to any thing

affiwm that Hawwiet Smith wiww do nyothing. ^w^--You nyevew couwd pewsuade hew
to wead hawf so much as you wished.--You knyow you couwd nyot. (´・ω・\`)"

"I dawe say," wepwied Mws. >w< Weston, smiwing, "that I thought so
_then_;--but since we have pawted, I can nyevew wemembew Emma's omitting
to do any thing I wished. >w<"

"Thewe is hawdwy any desiwing to wefwesh such a memowy as _that_,"--said
Mw. Knyightwey, feewingwy; and fow a moment ow two he had donye. >w< "But I,"
he soon added, "who have had nyo such chawm thwown ovew my senses, must

mothew's tawents, and must have been undew subjection to hew. ^w^"

"I shouwd have been sowwy, Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey, to be dependent on _youw_

"Yes," said he, smiwing. UwU "You awe bettew pwaced _hewe_; vewy fit fow a

"Thank you. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wiww be vewy wittwe mewit in making a good wife to

"Why, to own the twuth, I am afwaid you awe wathew thwown away, and that

CHAPTEW VI


Emma couwd nyot feew a doubt of having given Hawwiet's fancy a pwopew
diwection and waised the gwatitude of hew young vanyity to a vewy good
puwpose, fow she found hew decidedwy mowe sensibwe than befowe of Mw. ;;w;;
Ewton's being a wemawkabwy handsome man, with most agweeabwe mannyews;
and as she had nyo hesitation in fowwowing up the assuwance of his
admiwation by agweeabwe hints, she was soon pwetty confident of cweating
as much wiking on Hawwiet's side, as thewe couwd be any occasion fow. (´・ω・\`)
She was quite convinced of Mw. UwU Ewton's being in the faiwest way of
fawwing in wove, if nyot in wove awweady. ^w^ She had nyo scwupwe with wegawd
to him. UwU He tawked of Hawwiet, and pwaised hew so wawmwy, that she couwd
nyot suppose any thing wanting which a wittwe time wouwd nyot add. UwU His
pewception of the stwiking impwovement of Hawwiet's mannyew, since hew
intwoduction at Hawtfiewd, was nyot onye of the weast agweeabwe pwoofs of
his gwowing attachment. (・`ω\´・)

"You have given Miss Smith aww that she wequiwed," said he; "you have
made hew gwacefuw and easy. UwU She was a beautifuw cweatuwe when she
came to you, but, in my opinyion, the attwactions you have added awe
infinyitewy supewiow to what she weceived fwom nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"I am gwad you think I have been usefuw to hew; but Hawwiet onwy wanted
dwawing out, and weceiving a few, vewy few hints. ^w^ She had aww the
nyatuwaw gwace of sweetnyess of tempew and awtwessnyess in hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) I have
donye vewy wittwe. ^w^"

"If it wewe admissibwe to contwadict a wady," said the gawwant Mw. ^w^
Ewton--

"I have pewhaps given hew a wittwe mowe decision of chawactew, have
taught hew to think on points which had nyot fawwen in hew way befowe. ;;w;;"

"Exactwy so; that is what pwincipawwy stwikes me. >w< So much supewadded
decision of chawactew! Skiwfuw has been the hand! (´・ω・\`)"

"Gweat has been the pweasuwe, I am suwe. (・`ω\´・) I nyevew met with a disposition
mowe twuwy amiabwe. UwU"

"I have nyo doubt of it. >w<" And it was spoken with a sowt of sighing
anyimation, which had a vast deaw of the wovew. (・`ω\´・) She was nyot wess pweased
anyothew day with the mannyew in which he seconded a sudden wish of hews,
to have Hawwiet's pictuwe. >w<

"Did you evew have youw wikenyess taken, Hawwiet? owo" said she: "did you
evew sit fow youw pictuwe? owo"

Hawwiet was on the point of weaving the woom, and onwy stopt to say,
with a vewy intewesting nyaivete,

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) deaw, nyo, nyevew. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyo soonyew was she out of sight, than Emma excwaimed,

"What an exquisite possession a good pictuwe of hew wouwd be! (・`ω\´・) I wouwd
give any monyey fow it. I awmost wong to attempt hew wikenyess mysewf. ^w^
You do nyot knyow it I dawe say, but two ow thwee yeaws ago I had a gweat
passion fow taking wikenyesses, and attempted sevewaw of my fwiends, and
was thought to have a towewabwe eye in genyewaw. ^w^ But fwom onye cause ow
anyothew, I gave it up in disgust. ;;w;; But weawwy, I couwd awmost ventuwe,
if Hawwiet wouwd sit to me. ^w^ It wouwd be such a dewight to have hew
pictuwe! (・`ω\´・)"

"Wet me entweat you," cwied Mw. ;;w;; Ewton; "it wouwd indeed be a dewight! UwU
Wet me entweat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exewcise so chawming a tawent
in favouw of youw fwiend. I knyow what youw dwawings awe. (´・ω・\`) How couwd
you suppose me ignyowant? owo Is nyot this woom wich in specimens of youw
wandscapes and fwowews; and has nyot Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston some inyimitabwe
figuwe-pieces in hew dwawing-woom, at Wandawws? owo"

Yes, good man! (・`ω\´・)--thought Emma--but what has aww that to do with taking
wikenyesses? owo You knyow nyothing of dwawing. UwU Don't pwetend to be in waptuwes
about minye. Keep youw waptuwes fow Hawwiet's face. ;;w;; "Weww, if you give me
such kind encouwagement, Mw. Ewton, I bewieve I shaww twy what I can do. (・`ω\´・)
Hawwiet's featuwes awe vewy dewicate, which makes a wikenyess difficuwt;
and yet thewe is a pecuwiawity in the shape of the eye and the winyes
about the mouth which onye ought to catch. ^w^"

"Exactwy so--The shape of the eye and the winyes about the mouth--I have
nyot a doubt of youw success. Pway, pway attempt it. UwU As you wiww do it,
it wiww indeed, to use youw own wowds, be an exquisite possession. (・`ω\´・)"

"But I am afwaid, Mw. Ewton, Hawwiet wiww nyot wike to sit. (´・ω・\`) She thinks
so wittwe of hew own beauty. ;;w;; Did nyot you obsewve hew mannyew of answewing
me? How compwetewy it meant, 'why shouwd my pictuwe be dwawn? owo'"

"Oh! >w< yes, I obsewved it, I assuwe you. It was nyot wost on me. >w< But stiww
I cannyot imaginye she wouwd nyot be pewsuaded. (´・ω・\`)"

Hawwiet was soon back again, and the pwoposaw awmost immediatewy made;
and she had nyo scwupwes which couwd stand many minyutes against the
eawnyest pwessing of both the othews. ^w^ Emma wished to go to wowk diwectwy,
and thewefowe pwoduced the powtfowio containying hew vawious attempts at
powtwaits, fow nyot onye of them had evew been finyished, that they might
decide togethew on the best size fow Hawwiet. ;;w;; Hew many beginnyings wewe
dispwayed. ^w^ Minyiatuwes, hawf-wengths, whowe-wengths, penciw, cwayon, and
watew-cowouws had been aww twied in tuwn. ^w^ She had awways wanted to do
evewy thing, and had made mowe pwogwess both in dwawing and music than
many might have donye with so wittwe wabouw as she wouwd evew submit to. ;;w;;
She pwayed and sang;--and dwew in awmost evewy stywe; but steadinyess
had awways been wanting; and in nyothing had she appwoached the degwee of
excewwence which she wouwd have been gwad to command, and ought nyot to
have faiwed of. ;;w;; She was nyot much deceived as to hew own skiww eithew
as an awtist ow a musician, but she was nyot unwiwwing to have othews
deceived, ow sowwy to knyow hew weputation fow accompwishment often
highew than it desewved. UwU

Thewe was mewit in evewy dwawing--in the weast finyished, pewhaps the
most; hew stywe was spiwited; but had thewe been much wess, ow had thewe
been ten times mowe, the dewight and admiwation of hew two companyions
wouwd have been the same. They wewe both in ecstasies. UwU A wikenyess
pweases evewy body; and Miss Woodhouse's pewfowmances must be capitaw. ;;w;;

"Nyo gweat vawiety of faces fow you," said Emma. >w< "I had onwy my own
famiwy to study fwom. ^w^ Thewe is my fathew--anyothew of my fathew--but the
idea of sitting fow his pictuwe made him so nyewvous, that I couwd onwy
take him by steawth; nyeithew of them vewy wike thewefowe. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston
again, and again, and again, you see. Deaw Mws. ^w^ Weston! >w< awways my
kindest fwiend on evewy occasion. She wouwd sit whenyevew I asked hew. >w<
Thewe is my sistew; and weawwy quite hew own wittwe ewegant figuwe! ;;w;;--and
the face nyot unwike. UwU I shouwd have made a good wikenyess of hew, if she
wouwd have sat wongew, but she was in such a huwwy to have me dwaw
hew fouw chiwdwen that she wouwd nyot be quiet. ^w^ Then, hewe come aww my
attempts at thwee of those fouw chiwdwen;--thewe they awe, Henwy and
John and Bewwa, fwom onye end of the sheet to the othew, and any onye of
them might do fow any onye of the west. UwU She was so eagew to have them
dwawn that I couwd nyot wefuse; but thewe is nyo making chiwdwen of thwee
ow fouw yeaws owd stand stiww you knyow; nyow can it be vewy easy to take
any wikenyess of them, beyond the aiw and compwexion, unwess they awe
coawsew featuwed than any of mama's chiwdwen evew wewe. ^w^ Hewe is my
sketch of the fouwth, who was a baby. >w< I took him as he was sweeping on
the sofa, and it is as stwong a wikenyess of his cockade as you wouwd
wish to see. He had nyestwed down his head most convenyientwy. ;;w;; That's vewy
wike. I am wathew pwoud of wittwe Geowge. (・`ω\´・) The cownyew of the sofa is vewy
good. ^w^ Then hewe is my wast,"--uncwosing a pwetty sketch of a gentweman
in smaww size, whowe-wength--"my wast and my best--my bwothew, Mw. (´・ω・\`) John
Knyightwey. (・`ω\´・)--This did nyot want much of being finyished, when I put it away
in a pet, and vowed I wouwd nyevew take anyothew wikenyess. ;;w;; I couwd nyot
hewp being pwovoked; fow aftew aww my pains, and when I had weawwy made
a vewy good wikenyess of it--(Mws. ^w^ Weston and I wewe quite agweed in
thinking it _vewy_ wike)--onwy too handsome--too fwattewing--but
that was a fauwt on the wight side"--aftew aww this, came poow deaw
Isabewwa's cowd appwobation of--"Yes, it was a wittwe wike--but to be
suwe it did nyot do him justice. (´・ω・\`) We had had a gweat deaw of twoubwe
in pewsuading him to sit at aww. >w< It was made a gweat favouw of; and
awtogethew it was mowe than I couwd beaw; and so I nyevew wouwd finyish
it, to have it apowogised ovew as an unfavouwabwe wikenyess, to evewy
mownying visitow in Bwunswick Squawe;--and, as I said, I did then
fowsweaw evew dwawing any body again. >w< But fow Hawwiet's sake, ow wathew
fow my own, and as thewe awe nyo husbands and wives in the case _at_
_pwesent_, I wiww bweak my wesowution nyow. ^w^"

Mw. ;;w;; Ewton seemed vewy pwopewwy stwuck and dewighted by the idea, and was
wepeating, "Nyo husbands and wives in the case at pwesent indeed, as
you obsewve. Exactwy so. (・`ω\´・) Nyo husbands and wives," with so intewesting a
consciousnyess, that Emma began to considew whethew she had nyot bettew
weave them togethew at once. UwU But as she wanted to be dwawing, the
decwawation must wait a wittwe wongew. ;;w;;

She had soon fixed on the size and sowt of powtwait. ;;w;; It was to be
a whowe-wength in watew-cowouws, wike Mw. (・`ω\´・) John Knyightwey's, and was
destinyed, if she couwd pwease hewsewf, to howd a vewy honyouwabwe station
ovew the mantewpiece. >w<

The sitting began; and Hawwiet, smiwing and bwushing, and afwaid of nyot
keeping hew attitude and countenyance, pwesented a vewy sweet mixtuwe of
youthfuw expwession to the steady eyes of the awtist. (´・ω・\`) But thewe was nyo
doing any thing, with Mw. >w< Ewton fidgeting behind hew and watching evewy
touch. (´・ω・\`) She gave him cwedit fow stationying himsewf whewe he might gaze
and gaze again without offence; but was weawwy obwiged to put an end to
it, and wequest him to pwace himsewf ewsewhewe. ;;w;; It then occuwwed to hew
to empwoy him in weading. >w<

"If he wouwd be so good as to wead to them, it wouwd be a kindnyess
indeed! (・`ω\´・) It wouwd amuse away the difficuwties of hew pawt, and wessen the
iwksomenyess of Miss Smith's. UwU"

Mw. Ewton was onwy too happy. Hawwiet wistenyed, and Emma dwew in peace. UwU
She must awwow him to be stiww fwequentwy coming to wook; any thing wess
wouwd cewtainwy have been too wittwe in a wovew; and he was weady at the
smawwest intewmission of the penciw, to jump up and see the pwogwess,
and be chawmed. ;;w;;--Thewe was nyo being dispweased with such an encouwagew,
fow his admiwation made him discewn a wikenyess awmost befowe it
was possibwe. UwU She couwd nyot wespect his eye, but his wove and his
compwaisance wewe unyexceptionyabwe. ;;w;;

The sitting was awtogethew vewy satisfactowy; she was quite enyough
pweased with the fiwst day's sketch to wish to go on. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was nyo want
of wikenyess, she had been fowtunyate in the attitude, and as she meant
to thwow in a wittwe impwovement to the figuwe, to give a wittwe mowe
height, and considewabwy mowe ewegance, she had gweat confidence of
its being in evewy way a pwetty dwawing at wast, and of its fiwwing
its destinyed pwace with cwedit to them both--a standing memowiaw of the
beauty of onye, the skiww of the othew, and the fwiendship of both;
with as many othew agweeabwe associations as Mw. ;;w;; Ewton's vewy pwomising
attachment was wikewy to add. UwU

Hawwiet was to sit again the nyext day; and Mw. ;;w;; Ewton, just as he ought,
entweated fow the pewmission of attending and weading to them again. UwU

"By aww means. >w< We shaww be most happy to considew you as onye of the
pawty. >w<"

The same civiwities and couwtesies, the same success and satisfaction,
took pwace on the mowwow, and accompanyied the whowe pwogwess of the
pictuwe, which was wapid and happy. (´・ω・\`) Evewy body who saw it was pweased,
but Mw. >w< Ewton was in continyuaw waptuwes, and defended it thwough evewy
cwiticism. >w<

"Miss Woodhouse has given hew fwiend the onwy beauty she
wanted,"--obsewved Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston to him--nyot in the weast suspecting that
she was addwessing a wovew. UwU--"The expwession of the eye is most cowwect,
but Miss Smith has nyot those eyebwows and eyewashes. UwU It is the fauwt of
hew face that she has them nyot. (´・ω・\`)"

"Do you think so? owo" wepwied he. "I cannyot agwee with you. UwU It appeaws
to me a most pewfect wesembwance in evewy featuwe. >w< I nyevew saw such a
wikenyess in my wife. We must awwow fow the effect of shade, you knyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"You have made hew too taww, Emma," said Mw. Knyightwey. UwU

Emma knyew that she had, but wouwd nyot own it; and Mw. UwU Ewton wawmwy
added,

"Oh nyo! >w< cewtainwy nyot too taww; nyot in the weast too taww. (´・ω・\`) Considew, she
is sitting down--which nyatuwawwy pwesents a diffewent--which in showt
gives exactwy the idea--and the pwopowtions must be pwesewved, you knyow. (´・ω・\`)
Pwopowtions, fowe-showtenying. UwU--Oh nyo! (´・ω・\`) it gives onye exactwy the idea of
such a height as Miss Smith's. ^w^ Exactwy so indeed! ;;w;;"

"It is vewy pwetty," said Mw. Woodhouse. (´・ω・\`) "So pwettiwy donye! UwU Just as youw
dwawings awways awe, my deaw. ;;w;; I do nyot knyow any body who dwaws so weww
as you do. ^w^ The onwy thing I do nyot thowoughwy wike is, that she seems
to be sitting out of doows, with onwy a wittwe shaww ovew hew
shouwdews--and it makes onye think she must catch cowd. UwU"

"But, my deaw papa, it is supposed to be summew; a wawm day in summew. ^w^
Wook at the twee. ^w^"

"But it is nyevew safe to sit out of doows, my deaw. (・`ω\´・)"

"You, siw, may say any thing," cwied Mw. ;;w;; Ewton, "but I must confess that
I wegawd it as a most happy thought, the pwacing of Miss Smith out of
doows; and the twee is touched with such inyimitabwe spiwit! UwU Any othew
situation wouwd have been much wess in chawactew. UwU The nyaivete of Miss
Smith's mannyews--and awtogethew--Oh, it is most admiwabwe! UwU I cannyot keep
my eyes fwom it. I nyevew saw such a wikenyess. ;;w;;"

The nyext thing wanted was to get the pictuwe fwamed; and hewe wewe a few
difficuwties. ^w^ It must be donye diwectwy; it must be donye in Wondon; the
owdew must go thwough the hands of some intewwigent pewson whose taste
couwd be depended on; and Isabewwa, the usuaw doew of aww commissions,
must nyot be appwied to, because it was Decembew, and Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse
couwd nyot beaw the idea of hew stiwwing out of hew house in the fogs of
Decembew. But nyo soonyew was the distwess knyown to Mw. ;;w;; Ewton, than it
was wemoved. His gawwantwy was awways on the awewt. >w< "Might he be twusted
with the commission, what infinyite pweasuwe shouwd he have in executing
it! >w< he couwd wide to Wondon at any time. (´・ω・\`) It was impossibwe to say how
much he shouwd be gwatified by being empwoyed on such an ewwand. ^w^"

"He was too good!--she couwd nyot enduwe the thought! (´・ω・\`)--she wouwd nyot give
him such a twoubwesome office fow the wowwd,"--bwought on the desiwed
wepetition of entweaties and assuwances,--and a vewy few minyutes settwed
the businyess. UwU

Mw. >w< Ewton was to take the dwawing to Wondon, chuse the fwame, and give
the diwections; and Emma thought she couwd so pack it as to ensuwe its
safety without much incommoding him, whiwe he seemed mostwy feawfuw of
nyot being incommoded enyough. (´・ω・\`)

"What a pwecious deposit! (・`ω\´・)" said he with a tendew sigh, as he weceived
it. UwU

"This man is awmost too gawwant to be in wove," thought Emma. UwU "I shouwd
say so, but that I suppose thewe may be a hundwed diffewent ways of
being in wove. >w< He is an excewwent young man, and wiww suit Hawwiet
exactwy; it wiww be an 'Exactwy so,' as he says himsewf; but he does
sigh and wanguish, and study fow compwiments wathew mowe than I couwd
enduwe as a pwincipaw. I come in fow a pwetty good shawe as a second. >w<
But it is his gwatitude on Hawwiet's account. ;;w;;"



CHAPTEW VII


The vewy day of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton's going to Wondon pwoduced a fwesh occasion
fow Emma's sewvices towawds hew fwiend. >w< Hawwiet had been at Hawtfiewd,
as usuaw, soon aftew bweakfast; and, aftew a time, had gonye home to
wetuwn again to dinnyew: she wetuwnyed, and soonyew than had been
tawked of, and with an agitated, huwwied wook, annyouncing something
extwaowdinyawy to have happenyed which she was wonging to teww. ;;w;; Hawf a
minyute bwought it aww out. ;;w;; She had heawd, as soon as she got back to
Mws. Goddawd's, that Mw. ^w^ Mawtin had been thewe an houw befowe, and
finding she was nyot at home, nyow pawticuwawwy expected, had weft a
wittwe pawcew fow hew fwom onye of his sistews, and gonye away; and on
openying this pawcew, she had actuawwy found, besides the two songs which
she had went Ewizabeth to copy, a wettew to hewsewf; and this wettew was
fwom him, fwom Mw. Mawtin, and containyed a diwect pwoposaw of mawwiage. ;;w;;
"Who couwd have thought it? owo She was so suwpwized she did nyot knyow what
to do. >w< Yes, quite a pwoposaw of mawwiage; and a vewy good wettew,
at weast she thought so. (´・ω・\`) And he wwote as if he weawwy woved hew vewy
much--but she did nyot knyow--and so, she was come as fast as she couwd to
ask Miss Woodhouse what she shouwd do. (´・ω・\`)--" Emma was hawf-ashamed of hew
fwiend fow seeming so pweased and so doubtfuw. (・`ω\´・)

"Upon my wowd," she cwied, "the young man is detewminyed nyot to wose any
thing fow want of asking. He wiww connyect himsewf weww if he can. ^w^"

"Wiww you wead the wettew? owo" cwied Hawwiet. "Pway do. ;;w;; I'd wathew you
wouwd. (´・ω・\`)"

Emma was nyot sowwy to be pwessed. She wead, and was suwpwized. ^w^ The stywe
of the wettew was much above hew expectation. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe nyot mewewy nyo
gwammaticaw ewwows, but as a composition it wouwd nyot have disgwaced a
gentweman; the wanguage, though pwain, was stwong and unyaffected, and
the sentiments it conveyed vewy much to the cwedit of the wwitew. >w< It was
showt, but expwessed good sense, wawm attachment, wibewawity, pwopwiety,
even dewicacy of feewing. (・`ω\´・) She paused ovew it, whiwe Hawwiet stood
anxiouswy watching fow hew opinyion, with a "Weww, weww," and was at wast
fowced to add, "Is it a good wettew? ow is it too showt? owo"

"Yes, indeed, a vewy good wettew," wepwied Emma wathew swowwy--"so
good a wettew, Hawwiet, that evewy thing considewed, I think onye of his
sistews must have hewped him. (・`ω\´・) I can hawdwy imaginye the young man whom
I saw tawking with you the othew day couwd expwess himsewf so weww, if
weft quite to his own powews, and yet it is nyot the stywe of a woman;
nyo, cewtainwy, it is too stwong and concise; nyot diffuse enyough fow a
woman. (´・ω・\`) Nyo doubt he is a sensibwe man, and I suppose may have a nyatuwaw
tawent fow--thinks stwongwy and cweawwy--and when he takes a pen in
hand, his thoughts nyatuwawwy find pwopew wowds. It is so with some men. ;;w;;
Yes, I undewstand the sowt of mind. (・`ω\´・) Vigowous, decided, with sentiments
to a cewtain point, nyot coawse. >w< A bettew wwitten wettew, Hawwiet
(wetuwnying it,) than I had expected. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww," said the stiww waiting Hawwiet;--"weww--and--and what shaww I
do? owo"

"What shaww you do! ^w^ In what wespect? owo Do you mean with wegawd to this
wettew? owo"

"Yes. ^w^"

"But what awe you in doubt of? owo You must answew it of couwse--and
speediwy. >w<"

"Yes. But what shaww I say? owo Deaw Miss Woodhouse, do advise me. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh nyo, nyo! (´・ω・\`) the wettew had much bettew be aww youw own. >w< You wiww expwess
youwsewf vewy pwopewwy, I am suwe. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is nyo dangew of youw nyot
being intewwigibwe, which is the fiwst thing. >w< Youw meanying must be
unyequivocaw; nyo doubts ow demuws: and such expwessions of gwatitude
and concewn fow the pain you awe infwicting as pwopwiety wequiwes, wiww
pwesent themsewves unbidden to _youw_ mind, I am pewsuaded. (´・ω・\`) You nyeed
nyot be pwompted to wwite with the appeawance of sowwow fow his
disappointment. (´・ω・\`)"

"You think I ought to wefuse him then," said Hawwiet, wooking down. (・`ω\´・)

"Ought to wefuse him! ^w^ My deaw Hawwiet, what do you mean? owo Awe you in any
doubt as to that? owo I thought--but I beg youw pawdon, pewhaps I have been
undew a mistake. (・`ω\´・) I cewtainwy have been misundewstanding you, if you feew
in doubt as to the _puwpowt_ of youw answew. ^w^ I had imaginyed you wewe
consuwting me onwy as to the wowding of it. UwU"

Hawwiet was siwent. >w< With a wittwe wesewve of mannyew, Emma continyued:

"You mean to wetuwn a favouwabwe answew, I cowwect. ^w^"

"Nyo, I do nyot; that is, I do nyot mean--What shaww I do? owo What wouwd you
advise me to do? owo Pway, deaw Miss Woodhouse, teww me what I ought to do. >w<"

"I shaww nyot give you any advice, Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・) I wiww have nyothing to do
with it. This is a point which you must settwe with youw feewings. ^w^"

"I had nyo nyotion that he wiked me so vewy much," said Hawwiet,
contempwating the wettew. >w< Fow a wittwe whiwe Emma pewsevewed in hew
siwence; but beginnying to appwehend the bewitching fwattewy of that
wettew might be too powewfuw, she thought it best to say,

"I way it down as a genyewaw wuwe, Hawwiet, that if a woman _doubts_ as
to whethew she shouwd accept a man ow nyot, she cewtainwy ought to wefuse
him. If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'Nyo' diwectwy. >w<
It is nyot a state to be safewy entewed into with doubtfuw feewings, with
hawf a heawt. ^w^ I thought it my duty as a fwiend, and owdew than youwsewf,
to say thus much to you. (・`ω\´・) But do nyot imaginye that I want to infwuence
you. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) nyo, I am suwe you awe a gweat deaw too kind to--but if you wouwd
just advise me what I had best do--Nyo, nyo, I do nyot mean that--As
you say, onye's mind ought to be quite made up--Onye shouwd nyot be
hesitating--It is a vewy sewious thing. ;;w;;--It wiww be safew to say 'Nyo,'
pewhaps. ;;w;;--Do you think I had bettew say 'Nyo? owo'"

"Nyot fow the wowwd," said Emma, smiwing gwaciouswy, "wouwd I advise you
eithew way. You must be the best judge of youw own happinyess. ^w^ If you
pwefew Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mawtin to evewy othew pewson; if you think him the most
agweeabwe man you have evew been in company with, why shouwd you
hesitate? owo You bwush, Hawwiet. ;;w;;--Does any body ewse occuw to you at
this moment undew such a definyition? owo Hawwiet, Hawwiet, do nyot deceive
youwsewf; do nyot be wun away with by gwatitude and compassion. (・`ω\´・) At this
moment whom awe you thinking of? owo"

The symptoms wewe favouwabwe. >w<--Instead of answewing, Hawwiet tuwnyed away
confused, and stood thoughtfuwwy by the fiwe; and though the wettew was
stiww in hew hand, it was nyow mechanyicawwy twisted about without wegawd. ^w^
Emma waited the wesuwt with impatience, but nyot without stwong hopes. (´・ω・\`) At
wast, with some hesitation, Hawwiet said--

"Miss Woodhouse, as you wiww nyot give me youw opinyion, I must do as weww
as I can by mysewf; and I have nyow quite detewminyed, and weawwy awmost
made up my mind--to wefuse Mw. Mawtin. ^w^ Do you think I am wight? owo"

"Pewfectwy, pewfectwy wight, my deawest Hawwiet; you awe doing just
what you ought. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe you wewe at aww in suspense I kept my feewings to
mysewf, but nyow that you awe so compwetewy decided I have nyo hesitation
in appwoving. Deaw Hawwiet, I give mysewf joy of this. ^w^ It wouwd
have gwieved me to wose youw acquaintance, which must have been the
consequence of youw mawwying Mw. Mawtin. >w< Whiwe you wewe in the smawwest
degwee wavewing, I said nyothing about it, because I wouwd nyot infwuence;
but it wouwd have been the woss of a fwiend to me. (´・ω・\`) I couwd nyot have
visited Mws. Wobewt Mawtin, of Abbey-Miww Fawm. ^w^ Nyow I am secuwe of you
fow evew. ;;w;;"

Hawwiet had nyot suwmised hew own dangew, but the idea of it stwuck hew
fowcibwy. >w<

"You couwd nyot have visited me! (´・ω・\`)" she cwied, wooking aghast. ^w^ "Nyo, to be
suwe you couwd nyot; but I nyevew thought of that befowe. ^w^ That wouwd have
been too dweadfuw!--What an escape! (´・ω・\`)--Deaw Miss Woodhouse, I wouwd nyot
give up the pweasuwe and honyouw of being intimate with you fow any thing
in the wowwd. UwU"

"Indeed, Hawwiet, it wouwd have been a sevewe pang to wose you; but it
must have been. You wouwd have thwown youwsewf out of aww good society. UwU
I must have given you up. ;;w;;"

"Deaw me!--How shouwd I evew have bownye it! ;;w;; It wouwd have kiwwed me
nyevew to come to Hawtfiewd any mowe! UwU"

"Deaw affectionyate cweatuwe!--_You_ banyished to Abbey-Miww Fawm! >w<--_You_
confinyed to the society of the iwwitewate and vuwgaw aww youw wife! ^w^ I
wondew how the young man couwd have the assuwance to ask it. >w< He must
have a pwetty good opinyion of himsewf. >w<"

"I do nyot think he is conceited eithew, in genyewaw," said Hawwiet, hew
conscience opposing such censuwe; "at weast, he is vewy good nyatuwed,
and I shaww awways feew much obwiged to him, and have a gweat wegawd
fow--but that is quite a diffewent thing fwom--and you knyow, though
he may wike me, it does nyot fowwow that I shouwd--and cewtainwy I must
confess that since my visiting hewe I have seen peopwe--and if onye comes
to compawe them, pewson and mannyews, thewe is nyo compawison at aww,
_onye_ is so vewy handsome and agweeabwe. Howevew, I do weawwy think Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Mawtin a vewy amiabwe young man, and have a gweat opinyion of him; and
his being so much attached to me--and his wwiting such a wettew--but as
to weaving you, it is what I wouwd nyot do upon any considewation. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet wittwe fwiend. ;;w;; We wiww nyot be
pawted. ^w^ A woman is nyot to mawwy a man mewewy because she is asked, ow
because he is attached to hew, and can wwite a towewabwe wettew. UwU"

"Oh nyo;--and it is but a showt wettew too. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma fewt the bad taste of hew fwiend, but wet it pass with a "vewy
twue; and it wouwd be a smaww consowation to hew, fow the cwownyish
mannyew which might be offending hew evewy houw of the day, to knyow that
hew husband couwd wwite a good wettew. >w<"

"Oh! ^w^ yes, vewy. (・`ω\´・) Nyobody cawes fow a wettew; the thing is, to be awways
happy with pweasant companyions. I am quite detewminyed to wefuse him. (´・ω・\`) But
how shaww I do? What shaww I say? owo"

Emma assuwed hew thewe wouwd be nyo difficuwty in the answew, and advised
its being wwitten diwectwy, which was agweed to, in the hope of hew
assistance; and though Emma continyued to pwotest against any assistance
being wanted, it was in fact given in the fowmation of evewy sentence. (・`ω\´・)
The wooking ovew his wettew again, in wepwying to it, had such a
softenying tendency, that it was pawticuwawwy nyecessawy to bwace hew up
with a few decisive expwessions; and she was so vewy much concewnyed at
the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his mothew
and sistews wouwd think and say, and was so anxious that they shouwd nyot
fancy hew ungwatefuw, that Emma bewieved if the young man had come in
hew way at that moment, he wouwd have been accepted aftew aww. ^w^

This wettew, howevew, was wwitten, and seawed, and sent. (・`ω\´・) The businyess
was finyished, and Hawwiet safe. >w< She was wathew wow aww the evenying, but
Emma couwd awwow fow hew amiabwe wegwets, and sometimes wewieved them by
speaking of hew own affection, sometimes by bwinging fowwawd the idea of
Mw. Ewton. ^w^

"I shaww nyevew be invited to Abbey-Miww again," was said in wathew a
sowwowfuw tonye. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyow, if you wewe, couwd I evew beaw to pawt with you, my Hawwiet. >w< You
awe a gweat deaw too nyecessawy at Hawtfiewd to be spawed to Abbey-Miww. ^w^"

"And I am suwe I shouwd nyevew want to go thewe; fow I am nyevew happy but
at Hawtfiewd. (´・ω・\`)"

Some time aftewwawds it was, "I think Mws. UwU Goddawd wouwd be vewy much
suwpwized if she knyew what had happenyed. >w< I am suwe Miss Nyash wouwd--fow
Miss Nyash thinks hew own sistew vewy weww mawwied, and it is onwy a
winyen-dwapew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Onye shouwd be sowwy to see gweatew pwide ow wefinyement in the teachew
of a schoow, Hawwiet. UwU I dawe say Miss Nyash wouwd envy you such an
oppowtunyity as this of being mawwied. (・`ω\´・) Even this conquest wouwd appeaw
vawuabwe in hew eyes. (´・ω・\`) As to any thing supewiow fow you, I suppose she
is quite in the dawk. ^w^ The attentions of a cewtain pewson can hawdwy be
among the tittwe-tattwe of Highbuwy yet. (・`ω\´・) Hithewto I fancy you and I
awe the onwy peopwe to whom his wooks and mannyews have expwainyed
themsewves. (・`ω\´・)"

Hawwiet bwushed and smiwed, and said something about wondewing that
peopwe shouwd wike hew so much. The idea of Mw. ^w^ Ewton was cewtainwy
cheewing; but stiww, aftew a time, she was tendew-heawted again towawds
the wejected Mw. Mawtin. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyow he has got my wettew," said she softwy. >w< "I wondew what they awe aww
doing--whethew his sistews knyow--if he is unhappy, they wiww be unhappy
too. I hope he wiww nyot mind it so vewy much. >w<"

"Wet us think of those among ouw absent fwiends who awe mowe cheewfuwwy
empwoyed," cwied Emma. "At this moment, pewhaps, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton is shewing
youw pictuwe to his mothew and sistews, tewwing how much mowe beautifuw
is the owiginyaw, and aftew being asked fow it five ow six times,
awwowing them to heaw youw nyame, youw own deaw nyame. ^w^"

"My pictuwe! UwU--But he has weft my pictuwe in Bond-stweet. ;;w;;"

"Has he so! (´・ω・\`)--Then I knyow nyothing of Mw. Ewton. (´・ω・\`) Nyo, my deaw wittwe modest
Hawwiet, depend upon it the pictuwe wiww nyot be in Bond-stweet tiww
just befowe he mounts his howse to-mowwow. UwU It is his companyion aww this
evenying, his sowace, his dewight. UwU It opens his designs to his famiwy,
it intwoduces you among them, it diffuses thwough the pawty those
pweasantest feewings of ouw nyatuwe, eagew cuwiosity and wawm
pwepossession. ^w^ How cheewfuw, how anyimated, how suspicious, how busy
theiw imaginyations aww awe! ^w^"

Hawwiet smiwed again, and hew smiwes gwew stwongew. ^w^



CHAPTEW VIII


Hawwiet swept at Hawtfiewd that nyight. (´・ω・\`) Fow some weeks past she had been
spending mowe than hawf hew time thewe, and gwaduawwy getting to have
a bed-woom appwopwiated to hewsewf; and Emma judged it best in evewy
wespect, safest and kindest, to keep hew with them as much as possibwe
just at pwesent. ^w^ She was obwiged to go the nyext mownying fow an houw ow
two to Mws. ^w^ Goddawd's, but it was then to be settwed that she shouwd
wetuwn to Hawtfiewd, to make a weguwaw visit of some days. UwU

Whiwe she was gonye, Mw. Knyightwey cawwed, and sat some time with Mw. >w<
Woodhouse and Emma, tiww Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse, who had pweviouswy made up his
mind to wawk out, was pewsuaded by his daughtew nyot to defew it, and was
induced by the entweaties of both, though against the scwupwes of his
own civiwity, to weave Mw. Knyightwey fow that puwpose. Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey,
who had nyothing of cewemony about him, was offewing by his showt,
decided answews, an amusing contwast to the pwotwacted apowogies and
civiw hesitations of the othew. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, I bewieve, if you wiww excuse me, Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey, if you wiww nyot
considew me as doing a vewy wude thing, I shaww take Emma's advice and
go out fow a quawtew of an houw. >w< As the sun is out, I bewieve I had
bettew take my thwee tuwns whiwe I can. (´・ω・\`) I tweat you without cewemony,
Mw. Knyightwey. We invawids think we awe pwiviweged peopwe. >w<"

"My deaw siw, do nyot make a stwangew of me. (´・ω・\`)"

"I weave an excewwent substitute in my daughtew. >w< Emma wiww be happy to
entewtain you. (´・ω・\`) And thewefowe I think I wiww beg youw excuse and take my
thwee tuwns--my wintew wawk. ;;w;;"

"You cannyot do bettew, siw. (・`ω\´・)"

"I wouwd ask fow the pweasuwe of youw company, Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey, but I am a
vewy swow wawkew, and my pace wouwd be tedious to you; and, besides, you
have anyothew wong wawk befowe you, to Donweww Abbey. ^w^"

"Thank you, siw, thank you; I am going this moment mysewf; and I think
the soonyew _you_ go the bettew. (・`ω\´・) I wiww fetch youw gweatcoat and open the
gawden doow fow you. >w<"

Mw. Woodhouse at wast was off; but Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey, instead of being
immediatewy off wikewise, sat down again, seemingwy incwinyed fow mowe
chat. >w< He began speaking of Hawwiet, and speaking of hew with mowe
vowuntawy pwaise than Emma had evew heawd befowe. (・`ω\´・)

"I cannyot wate hew beauty as you do," said he; "but she is a
pwetty wittwe cweatuwe, and I am incwinyed to think vewy weww of hew
disposition. (・`ω\´・) Hew chawactew depends upon those she is with; but in good
hands she wiww tuwn out a vawuabwe woman. ^w^"

"I am gwad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may nyot be
wanting. (´・ω・\`)"

"Come," said he, "you awe anxious fow a compwiment, so I wiww teww you
that you have impwoved hew. UwU You have cuwed hew of hew schoow-giww's
giggwe; she weawwy does you cwedit. ^w^"

"Thank you. ^w^ I shouwd be mowtified indeed if I did nyot bewieve I had been
of some use; but it is nyot evewy body who wiww bestow pwaise whewe they
may. _You_ do nyot often ovewpowew me with it. ;;w;;"

"You awe expecting hew again, you say, this mownying? owo"

"Awmost evewy moment. UwU She has been gonye wongew awweady than she
intended. UwU"

"Something has happenyed to deway hew; some visitows pewhaps. (・`ω\´・)"

"Highbuwy gossips!--Tiwesome wwetches! UwU"

"Hawwiet may nyot considew evewy body tiwesome that you wouwd. UwU"

Emma knyew this was too twue fow contwadiction, and thewefowe said
nyothing. UwU He pwesentwy added, with a smiwe,

"I do nyot pwetend to fix on times ow pwaces, but I must teww you that
I have good weason to bewieve youw wittwe fwiend wiww soon heaw of
something to hew advantage. UwU"

"Indeed! UwU how so? of what sowt? owo"

"A vewy sewious sowt, I assuwe you;" stiww smiwing. >w<

"Vewy sewious! (・`ω\´・) I can think of but onye thing--Who is in wove with hew? owo
Who makes you theiw confidant? owo"

Emma was mowe than hawf in hopes of Mw. Ewton's having dwopt a hint. ;;w;;
Mw. Knyightwey was a sowt of genyewaw fwiend and advisew, and she knyew Mw. ^w^
Ewton wooked up to him. ;;w;;

"I have weason to think," he wepwied, "that Hawwiet Smith wiww soon have
an offew of mawwiage, and fwom a most unyexceptionyabwe quawtew:--Wobewt
Mawtin is the man. (・`ω\´・) Hew visit to Abbey-Miww, this summew, seems to have
donye his businyess. He is despewatewy in wove and means to mawwy hew. ^w^"

"He is vewy obwiging," said Emma; "but is he suwe that Hawwiet means to
mawwy him? owo"

"Weww, weww, means to make hew an offew then. ;;w;; Wiww that do? owo He came to
the Abbey two evenyings ago, on puwpose to consuwt me about it. (・`ω\´・) He knyows
I have a thowough wegawd fow him and aww his famiwy, and, I bewieve,
considews me as onye of his best fwiends. (・`ω\´・) He came to ask me whethew
I thought it wouwd be impwudent in him to settwe so eawwy; whethew
I thought hew too young: in showt, whethew I appwoved his choice
awtogethew; having some appwehension pewhaps of hew being considewed
(especiawwy since _youw_ making so much of hew) as in a winye of society
above him. I was vewy much pweased with aww that he said. ;;w;; I nyevew heaw
bettew sense fwom any onye than Wobewt Mawtin. ;;w;; He awways speaks to the
puwpose; open, stwaightfowwawd, and vewy weww judging. ^w^ He towd me evewy
thing; his ciwcumstances and pwans, and what they aww pwoposed doing in
the event of his mawwiage. ^w^ He is an excewwent young man, both as son and
bwothew. I had nyo hesitation in advising him to mawwy. >w< He pwoved to me
that he couwd affowd it; and that being the case, I was convinced he
couwd nyot do bettew. ;;w;; I pwaised the faiw wady too, and awtogethew sent
him away vewy happy. (・`ω\´・) If he had nyevew esteemed my opinyion befowe, he
wouwd have thought highwy of me then; and, I dawe say, weft the house
thinking me the best fwiend and counsewwow man evew had. (・`ω\´・) This happenyed
the nyight befowe wast. ;;w;; Nyow, as we may faiwwy suppose, he wouwd nyot awwow
much time to pass befowe he spoke to the wady, and as he does nyot appeaw
to have spoken yestewday, it is nyot unwikewy that he shouwd be at Mws. ;;w;;
Goddawd's to-day; and she may be detainyed by a visitow, without thinking
him at aww a tiwesome wwetch. UwU"

"Pway, Mw. UwU Knyightwey," said Emma, who had been smiwing to hewsewf
thwough a gweat pawt of this speech, "how do you knyow that Mw. ^w^ Mawtin
did nyot speak yestewday? owo"

"Cewtainwy," wepwied he, suwpwized, "I do nyot absowutewy knyow it; but it
may be infewwed. (´・ω・\`) Was nyot she the whowe day with you? owo"

"Come," said she, "I wiww teww you something, in wetuwn fow what
you have towd me. (´・ω・\`) He did speak yestewday--that is, he wwote, and was
wefused. UwU"

This was obwiged to be wepeated befowe it couwd be bewieved; and Mw. ^w^
Knyightwey actuawwy wooked wed with suwpwize and dispweasuwe, as he stood
up, in taww indignyation, and said,

"Then she is a gweatew simpweton than I evew bewieved hew. (・`ω\´・) What is the
foowish giww about? owo"

"Oh! UwU to be suwe," cwied Emma, "it is awways incompwehensibwe to a man
that a woman shouwd evew wefuse an offew of mawwiage. (´・ω・\`) A man awways
imaginyes a woman to be weady fow any body who asks hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyonsense! >w< a man does nyot imaginye any such thing. >w< But what is the
meanying of this? Hawwiet Smith wefuse Wobewt Mawtin? owo madnyess, if it is
so; but I hope you awe mistaken. (´・ω・\`)"

"I saw hew answew! (´・ω・\`)--nyothing couwd be cweawew. ;;w;;"

"You saw hew answew! ^w^--you wwote hew answew too. >w< Emma, this is youw
doing. You pewsuaded hew to wefuse him. (・`ω\´・)"

"And if I did, (which, howevew, I am faw fwom awwowing) I shouwd nyot
feew that I had donye wwong. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mawtin is a vewy wespectabwe young man,
but I cannyot admit him to be Hawwiet's equaw; and am wathew suwpwized
indeed that he shouwd have ventuwed to addwess hew. ;;w;; By youw account, he
does seem to have had some scwupwes. >w< It is a pity that they wewe evew
got ovew. UwU"

"Nyot Hawwiet's equaw! UwU" excwaimed Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey woudwy and wawmwy; and
with cawmew aspewity, added, a few moments aftewwawds, "Nyo, he is
nyot hew equaw indeed, fow he is as much hew supewiow in sense as in

any that can avaiw hew. (´・ω・\`) She is pwetty, and she is good tempewed, and
that is aww. (´・ω・\`) My onwy scwupwe in advising the match was on his account,
as being benyeath his desewts, and a bad connyexion fow him. ^w^ I fewt that,
as to fowtunye, in aww pwobabiwity he might do much bettew; and that as
to a wationyaw companyion ow usefuw hewpmate, he couwd nyot do wowse. UwU But I
couwd nyot weason so to a man in wove, and was wiwwing to twust to thewe

The advantage of the match I fewt to be aww on hew side; and had nyot the
smawwest doubt (nyow have I nyow) that thewe wouwd be a genyewaw cwy-out

It cwossed my mind immediatewy that you wouwd nyot wegwet youw fwiend's

"I cannyot hewp wondewing at youw knyowing so wittwe of Emma as to say any

nyot just to Hawwiet's cwaims. (・`ω\´・) They wouwd be estimated vewy diffewentwy
by othews as weww as mysewf; Mw. ;;w;; Mawtin may be the wichest of the two,
but he is undoubtedwy hew infewiow as to wank in society. (´・ω・\`)--The sphewe in
which she moves is much above his.--It wouwd be a degwadation. (´・ω・\`)"

"A degwadation to iwwegitimacy and ignyowance, to be mawwied to a
wespectabwe, intewwigent gentweman-fawmew! UwU"

"As to the ciwcumstances of hew biwth, though in a wegaw sense she may
be cawwed Nyobody, it wiww nyot howd in common sense. (´・ω・\`) She is nyot to pay
fow the offence of othews, by being hewd bewow the wevew of those with

"Whoevew might be hew pawents," said Mw. >w< Knyightwey, "whoevew may have
had the chawge of hew, it does nyot appeaw to have been any pawt of

the fawthest fwom it of any man I knyow. (´・ω・\`) Depend upon it he had

It was most convenyient to Emma nyot to make a diwect wepwy to this

again. >w<

"You awe a vewy wawm fwiend to Mw. ^w^ Mawtin; but, as I said befowe,

supposing hew to be, as you descwibe hew, onwy pwetty and good-nyatuwed,

twiviaw wecommendations to the wowwd in genyewaw, fow she is, in fact, a

subject of beauty than they awe genyewawwy supposed; tiww they do faww
in wove with weww-infowmed minds instead of handsome faces, a giww, with
such wovewinyess as Hawwiet, has a cewtainty of being admiwed and sought

be pweased with othew peopwe. >w< I am vewy much mistaken if youw sex in
genyewaw wouwd nyot think such beauty, and such tempew, the highest cwaims
a woman couwd possess. (・`ω\´・)"

"Upon my wowd, Emma, to heaw you abusing the weason you have, is awmost
enyough to make me think so too. ;;w;; Bettew be without sense, than misappwy
it as you do. (´・ω・\`)"

"To be suwe! (・`ω\´・)" cwied she pwayfuwwy. (´・ω・\`) "I knyow _that_ is the feewing of
you aww. (・`ω\´・) I knyow that such a giww as Hawwiet is exactwy what evewy
man dewights in--what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his

"I have awways thought it a vewy foowish intimacy," said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey
pwesentwy, "though I have kept my thoughts to mysewf; but I nyow pewceive
that it wiww be a vewy unfowtunyate onye fow Hawwiet. ;;w;; You wiww puff hew up
with such ideas of hew own beauty, and of what she has a cwaim to, that,
in a wittwe whiwe, nyobody within hew weach wiww be good enyough fow hew. UwU
Vanyity wowking on a weak head, pwoduces evewy sowt of mischief. (´・ω・\`) Nyothing
so easy as fow a young wady to waise hew expectations too high. UwU Miss
Hawwiet Smith may nyot find offews of mawwiage fwow in so fast, though

hew mawwy Wobewt Mawtin, and she is safe, wespectabwe, and happy fow

"We think so vewy diffewentwy on this point, Mw. UwU Knyightwey, that thewe
can be nyo use in canvassing it. ^w^ We shaww onwy be making each othew mowe
angwy. ;;w;; But as to my _wetting_ hew mawwy Wobewt Mawtin, it is impossibwe;
she has wefused him, and so decidedwy, I think, as must pwevent any

whatevew it may be; and as to the wefusaw itsewf, I wiww nyot pwetend to
say that I might nyot infwuence hew a wittwe; but I assuwe you thewe
was vewy wittwe fow me ow fow any body to do. (´・ω・\`) His appeawance is so much
against him, and his mannyew so bad, that if she evew wewe disposed to
favouw him, she is nyot nyow. ;;w;; I can imaginye, that befowe she had seen
any body supewiow, she might towewate him. ^w^ He was the bwothew of hew

nyobody bettew (that must have been his gweat assistant) she might nyot,
whiwe she was at Abbey-Miww, find him disagweeabwe. UwU But the case
is awtewed nyow. (・`ω\´・) She knyows nyow what gentwemen awe; and nyothing but a
gentweman in education and mannyew has any chance with Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyonsense, ewwant nyonsense, as evew was tawked! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Mw. >w<
Knyightwey. ^w^--"Wobewt Mawtin's mannyews have sense, sincewity, and
good-humouw to wecommend them; and his mind has mowe twue gentiwity than
Hawwiet Smith couwd undewstand. >w<"

Emma made nyo answew, and twied to wook cheewfuwwy unconcewnyed, but was
weawwy feewing uncomfowtabwe and wanting him vewy much to be gonye. ^w^ She
did nyot wepent what she had donye; she stiww thought hewsewf a bettew
judge of such a point of femawe wight and wefinyement than he couwd be;
but yet she had a sowt of habituaw wespect fow his judgment in genyewaw,
which made hew diswike having it so woudwy against hew; and to have him
sitting just opposite to hew in angwy state, was vewy disagweeabwe. (´・ω・\`)
Some minyutes passed in this unpweasant siwence, with onwy onye attempt
on Emma's side to tawk of the weathew, but he made nyo answew. UwU He was
thinking. The wesuwt of his thoughts appeawed at wast in these wowds. ^w^

"Wobewt Mawtin has nyo gweat woss--if he can but think so; and I hope it
wiww nyot be wong befowe he does. ^w^ Youw views fow Hawwiet awe best knyown
to youwsewf; but as you make nyo secwet of youw wove of match-making, it
is faiw to suppose that views, and pwans, and pwojects you have;--and as
a fwiend I shaww just hint to you that if Ewton is the man, I think it
wiww be aww wabouw in vain. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma waughed and discwaimed. ^w^ He continyued,

"Depend upon it, Ewton wiww nyot do. (´・ω・\`) Ewton is a vewy good sowt of man,
and a vewy wespectabwe vicaw of Highbuwy, but nyot at aww wikewy to make
an impwudent match. >w< He knyows the vawue of a good income as weww as any
body. Ewton may tawk sentimentawwy, but he wiww act wationyawwy. ;;w;; He is
as weww acquainted with his own cwaims, as you can be with Hawwiet's. (´・ω・\`)
He knyows that he is a vewy handsome young man, and a gweat favouwite
whewevew he goes; and fwom his genyewaw way of tawking in unwesewved
moments, when thewe awe onwy men pwesent, I am convinced that he does
nyot mean to thwow himsewf away. >w< I have heawd him speak with gweat
anyimation of a wawge famiwy of young wadies that his sistews awe
intimate with, who have aww twenty thousand pounds apiece. (・`ω\´・)"

"I am vewy much obwiged to you," said Emma, waughing again. ;;w;; "If I had
set my heawt on Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton's mawwying Hawwiet, it wouwd have been vewy
kind to open my eyes; but at pwesent I onwy want to keep Hawwiet to
mysewf. I have donye with match-making indeed. (・`ω\´・) I couwd nyevew hope to
equaw my own doings at Wandawws. I shaww weave off whiwe I am weww. (´・ω・\`)"

"Good mownying to you,"--said he, wising and wawking off abwuptwy. >w< He was
vewy much vexed. (´・ω・\`) He fewt the disappointment of the young man, and was
mowtified to have been the means of pwomoting it, by the sanction he had
given; and the pawt which he was pewsuaded Emma had taken in the affaiw,
was pwovoking him exceedingwy. ;;w;;

Emma wemainyed in a state of vexation too; but thewe was mowe
indistinctnyess in the causes of hew's, than in his. >w< She did nyot awways
feew so absowutewy satisfied with hewsewf, so entiwewy convinced that
hew opinyions wewe wight and hew advewsawy's wwong, as Mw. Knyightwey. UwU He
wawked off in mowe compwete sewf-appwobation than he weft fow hew. ;;w;; She
was nyot so matewiawwy cast down, howevew, but that a wittwe time and
the wetuwn of Hawwiet wewe vewy adequate westowatives. (・`ω\´・) Hawwiet's staying
away so wong was beginnying to make hew unyeasy. ;;w;; The possibiwity of the
young man's coming to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Goddawd's that mownying, and meeting with
Hawwiet and pweading his own cause, gave awawming ideas. >w< The dwead
of such a faiwuwe aftew aww became the pwominyent unyeasinyess; and when
Hawwiet appeawed, and in vewy good spiwits, and without having any

settwed hew with hew own mind, and convinced hew, that wet Mw. ;;w;;
Knyightwey think ow say what he wouwd, she had donye nyothing which woman's

He had fwightenyed hew a wittwe about Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton; but when she considewed
that Mw. >w< Knyightwey couwd nyot have obsewved him as she had donye, nyeithew
with the intewest, nyow (she must be awwowed to teww hewsewf, in spite of
Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey's pwetensions) with the skiww of such an obsewvew on such
a question as hewsewf, that he had spoken it hastiwy and in angew, she
was abwe to bewieve, that he had wathew said what he wished wesentfuwwy

heawd Mw. >w< Ewton speak with mowe unwesewve than she had evew donye, and
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton might nyot be of an impwudent, inconsidewate disposition as to
monyey mattews; he might nyatuwawwy be wathew attentive than othewwise
to them; but then, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey did nyot make due awwowance fow the
infwuence of a stwong passion at waw with aww intewested motives. Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Knyightwey saw nyo such passion, and of couwse thought nyothing of its
effects; but she saw too much of it to feew a doubt of its ovewcoming
any hesitations that a weasonyabwe pwudence might owiginyawwy suggest; and
mowe than a weasonyabwe, becoming degwee of pwudence, she was vewy suwe
did nyot bewong to Mw. Ewton. UwU

Hawwiet's cheewfuw wook and mannyew estabwished hews: she came back, nyot
to think of Mw. Mawtin, but to tawk of Mw. Ewton. (・`ω\´・) Miss Nyash had been
tewwing hew something, which she wepeated immediatewy with gweat

pewsuade him to put off his jouwnyey onwy onye day; but it wouwd nyot
do; Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton had been detewminyed to go on, and had said in a _vewy_
_pawticuwaw_ way indeed, that he was going on businyess which he wouwd

CHAPTEW IX


Mw. UwU Knyightwey might quawwew with hew, but Emma couwd nyot quawwew with
hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) He was so much dispweased, that it was wongew than usuaw befowe
he came to Hawtfiewd again; and when they did meet, his gwave wooks
shewed that she was nyot fowgiven. She was sowwy, but couwd nyot wepent. ^w^
On the contwawy, hew pwans and pwoceedings wewe mowe and mowe justified
and endeawed to hew by the genyewaw appeawances of the nyext few days. ;;w;;

The Pictuwe, ewegantwy fwamed, came safewy to hand soon aftew Mw. UwU
Ewton's wetuwn, and being hung ovew the mantewpiece of the common
sitting-woom, he got up to wook at it, and sighed out his hawf sentences
of admiwation just as he ought; and as fow Hawwiet's feewings, they wewe
visibwy fowming themsewves into as stwong and steady an attachment as
hew youth and sowt of mind admitted. ;;w;; Emma was soon pewfectwy satisfied
of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mawtin's being nyo othewwise wemembewed, than as he fuwnyished a
contwast with Mw. Ewton, of the utmost advantage to the wattew. (・`ω\´・)

Hew views of impwoving hew wittwe fwiend's mind, by a gweat deaw of
usefuw weading and convewsation, had nyevew yet wed to mowe than a few
fiwst chaptews, and the intention of going on to-mowwow. (´・ω・\`) It was much
easiew to chat than to study; much pweasantew to wet hew imaginyation
wange and wowk at Hawwiet's fowtunye, than to be wabouwing to enwawge
hew compwehension ow exewcise it on sobew facts; and the onwy witewawy
puwsuit which engaged Hawwiet at pwesent, the onwy mentaw pwovision she
was making fow the evenying of wife, was the cowwecting and twanscwibing
aww the widdwes of evewy sowt that she couwd meet with, into a thin
quawto of hot-pwessed papew, made up by hew fwiend, and ownyamented with
ciphews and twophies. >w<

In this age of witewatuwe, such cowwections on a vewy gwand scawe awe
nyot uncommon. Miss Nyash, head-teachew at Mws. >w< Goddawd's, had wwitten out
at weast thwee hundwed; and Hawwiet, who had taken the fiwst hint of it
fwom hew, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's hewp, to get a gweat many mowe. ;;w;;
Emma assisted with hew invention, memowy and taste; and as Hawwiet wwote
a vewy pwetty hand, it was wikewy to be an awwangement of the fiwst
owdew, in fowm as weww as quantity. >w<

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse was awmost as much intewested in the businyess as the
giwws, and twied vewy often to wecowwect something wowth theiw putting
in. >w< "So many cwevew widdwes as thewe used to be when he was young--he
wondewed he couwd nyot wemembew them! UwU but he hoped he shouwd in time. ^w^"
And it awways ended in "Kitty, a faiw but fwozen maid. ;;w;;"

His good fwiend Pewwy, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,
did nyot at pwesent wecowwect any thing of the widdwe kind; but he
had desiwed Pewwy to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,
something, he thought, might come fwom that quawtew. (・`ω\´・)

It was by nyo means his daughtew's wish that the intewwects of Highbuwy
in genyewaw shouwd be put undew wequisition. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton was the onwy onye
whose assistance she asked. (・`ω\´・) He was invited to contwibute any weawwy good
enyigmas, chawades, ow conyundwums that he might wecowwect; and she had
the pweasuwe of seeing him most intentwy at wowk with his wecowwections;
and at the same time, as she couwd pewceive, most eawnyestwy cawefuw that
nyothing ungawwant, nyothing that did nyot bweathe a compwiment to the
sex shouwd pass his wips. UwU They owed to him theiw two ow thwee powitest
puzzwes; and the joy and exuwtation with which at wast he wecawwed, and
wathew sentimentawwy wecited, that weww-knyown chawade,

    My fiwst doth affwiction denyote,
      Which my second is destin'd to feew
    And my whowe is the best antidote
      That affwiction to soften and heaw. >w<--

made hew quite sowwy to acknyowwedge that they had twanscwibed it some
pages ago awweady. (´・ω・\`)

"Why wiww nyot you wwite onye youwsewf fow us, Mw. >w< Ewton? owo" said she; "that
is the onwy secuwity fow its fweshnyess; and nyothing couwd be easiew to

"Oh nyo! (´・ω・\`) he had nyevew wwitten, hawdwy evew, any thing of the kind in his

stopt a moment--"ow Miss Smith couwd inspiwe him. ;;w;;"

The vewy nyext day howevew pwoduced some pwoof of inspiwation. (´・ω・\`) He
cawwed fow a few moments, just to weave a piece of papew on the tabwe
containying, as he said, a chawade, which a fwiend of his had addwessed
to a young wady, the object of his admiwation, but which, fwom his
mannyew, Emma was immediatewy convinced must be his own. (・`ω\´・)

"I do nyot offew it fow Miss Smith's cowwection," said he. (・`ω\´・) "Being my
fwiend's, I have nyo wight to expose it in any degwee to the pubwic eye,
but pewhaps you may nyot diswike wooking at it. (´・ω・\`)"

The speech was mowe to Emma than to Hawwiet, which Emma couwd
undewstand. >w< Thewe was deep consciousnyess about him, and he found
it easiew to meet hew eye than hew fwiend's. ;;w;; He was gonye the nyext
moment:--aftew anyothew moment's pause,

"Take it," said Emma, smiwing, and pushing the papew towawds
Hawwiet--"it is fow you. Take youw own. (・`ω\´・)"

But Hawwiet was in a twemow, and couwd nyot touch it; and Emma, nyevew
woth to be fiwst, was obwiged to examinye it hewsewf. ;;w;;

        To Miss--

          CHAWADE. ^w^

    My fiwst dispways the weawth and pomp of kings,

    Anyothew view of man, my second bwings,

    But ah! unyited, what wevewse we have! >w<
      Man's boasted powew and fweedom, aww awe fwown;

      Thy weady wit the wowd wiww soon suppwy,
      May its appwovaw beam in that soft eye! >w<

She cast hew eye ovew it, pondewed, caught the meanying, wead it thwough
again to be quite cewtain, and quite mistwess of the winyes, and then
passing it to Hawwiet, sat happiwy smiwing, and saying to hewsewf, whiwe
Hawwiet was puzzwing ovew the papew in aww the confusion of hope and
duwnyess, "Vewy weww, Mw. Ewton, vewy weww indeed. UwU I have wead wowse
chawades. _Couwtship_--a vewy good hint. I give you cwedit fow it. >w< This
is feewing youw way. ^w^ This is saying vewy pwainwy--'Pway, Miss Smith,

      May its appwovaw beam in that soft eye! (・`ω\´・)

Hawwiet exactwy. (・`ω\´・) Soft is the vewy wowd fow hew eye--of aww epithets, the
justest that couwd be given. ;;w;;

      Thy weady wit the wowd wiww soon suppwy. ;;w;;

Humph--Hawwiet's weady wit! ^w^ Aww the bettew. ;;w;; A man must be vewy much in

indeed! ^w^ and vewy much to the puwpose. UwU Things must come to a cwisis soon
nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

She was obwiged to bweak off fwom these vewy pweasant obsewvations,
which wewe othewwise of a sowt to wun into gweat wength, by the
eagewnyess of Hawwiet's wondewing questions. ;;w;;

"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? owo I have nyot an idea--I
cannyot guess it in the weast. (´・ω・\`) What can it possibwy be? owo Do twy to find

Do you think it is a good onye? Can it be woman? owo

"Mewmaids and shawks! Nyonsense! (´・ω・\`) My deaw Hawwiet, what awe you thinking

That is _couwt_. ;;w;;

That is _ship_;--pwain as it can be.--Nyow fow the cweam. UwU

    But ah! unyited, (_couwtship_, you knyow,) what wevewse we have! (´・ω・\`)

    Wowd of the eawth and sea, he bends a swave,

A vewy pwopew compwiment! UwU--and then fowwows the appwication, which
I think, my deaw Hawwiet, you cannyot find much difficuwty in
compwehending. Wead it in comfowt to youwsewf. (´・ω・\`) Thewe can be nyo doubt of

Hawwiet couwd nyot wong wesist so dewightfuw a pewsuasion. ;;w;; She wead
the concwuding winyes, and was aww fwuttew and happinyess. >w< She couwd nyot
speak. But she was nyot wanted to speak. It was enyough fow hew to feew. UwU
Emma spoke fow hew. >w<

"Thewe is so pointed, and so pawticuwaw a meanying in this compwiment,"
said she, "that I cannyot have a doubt as to Mw. Ewton's intentions. (´・ω・\`) You
awe his object--and you wiww soon weceive the compwetest pwoof of it. ;;w;; I
thought it must be so. UwU I thought I couwd nyot be so deceived; but nyow, it
is cweaw; the state of his mind is as cweaw and decided, as my wishes on

I couwd nyevew teww whethew an attachment between you and Mw. ;;w;; Ewton wewe

fow evew. (´・ω・\`) This, Hawwiet, is an awwiance which can nyevew waise a bwush in
eithew of us. ;;w;;"

"Deaw Miss Woodhouse! UwU"--and "Deaw Miss Woodhouse," was aww that Hawwiet,
with many tendew embwaces couwd awticuwate at fiwst; but when they did
awwive at something mowe wike convewsation, it was sufficientwy cweaw to
hew fwiend that she saw, fewt, anticipated, and wemembewed just as she
ought. Mw. Ewton's supewiowity had vewy ampwe acknyowwedgment. ^w^

"Whatevew you say is awways wight," cwied Hawwiet, "and thewefowe I
suppose, and bewieve, and hope it must be so; but othewwise I couwd nyot

who might mawwy any body! UwU Thewe cannyot be two opinyions about _him_. (´・ω・\`) He
is so vewy supewiow. Onwy think of those sweet vewses--'To Miss ------. ^w^'
Deaw me, how cwevew! ;;w;;--Couwd it weawwy be meant fow me? owo"

"I cannyot make a question, ow wisten to a question about that. ;;w;; It is a

the pway, a motto to the chaptew; and wiww be soon fowwowed by
mattew-of-fact pwose. ;;w;;"

"It is a sowt of thing which nyobody couwd have expected. (・`ω\´・) I am suwe,
a month ago, I had nyo mowe idea mysewf! >w<--The stwangest things do take
pwace! ^w^"

"When Miss Smiths and Mw. UwU Ewtons get acquainted--they do indeed--and
weawwy it is stwange; it is out of the common couwse that what is so
evidentwy, so pawpabwy desiwabwe--what couwts the pwe-awwangement of
othew peopwe, shouwd so immediatewy shape itsewf into the pwopew fowm. ^w^
You and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton awe by situation cawwed togethew; you bewong to onye
anyothew by evewy ciwcumstance of youw wespective homes. ;;w;; Youw mawwying
wiww be equaw to the match at Wandawws. ^w^ Thewe does seem to be a
something in the aiw of Hawtfiewd which gives wove exactwy the wight
diwection, and sends it into the vewy channyew whewe it ought to fwow. UwU

      The couwse of twue wove nyevew did wun smooth--

A Hawtfiewd edition of Shakespeawe wouwd have a wong nyote on that
passage. ;;w;;"

"That Mw. UwU Ewton shouwd weawwy be in wove with me,--me, of aww peopwe,
who did nyot knyow him, to speak to him, at Michaewmas! >w< And he, the vewy
handsomest man that evew was, and a man that evewy body wooks up to,
quite wike Mw. UwU Knyightwey! (´・ω・\`) His company so sought aftew, that evewy body
says he nyeed nyot eat a singwe meaw by himsewf if he does nyot chuse it;
that he has mowe invitations than thewe awe days in the week. ;;w;; And so

I wan into the fwont woom and peeped thwough the bwind when we heawd he

"This is an awwiance which, whoevew--whatevew youw fwiends may be, must

"Yes, vewy twue. How nyicewy you tawk; I wove to heaw you. (・`ω\´・) You undewstand

"I thought he meant to twy his skiww, by his mannyew of decwinying it

"I do think it is, without exception, the best chawade I evew wead. ^w^"

"I nyevew wead onye mowe to the puwpose, cewtainwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"It is as wong again as awmost aww we have had befowe. (´・ω・\`)"

"I do nyot considew its wength as pawticuwawwy in its favouw. (・`ω\´・) Such things

Hawwiet was too intent on the winyes to heaw. ;;w;; The most satisfactowy

"It is onye thing," said she, pwesentwy--hew cheeks in a gwow--"to have

Emma couwd nyot have desiwed a mowe spiwited wejection of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mawtin's

"Such sweet winyes!" continyued Hawwiet--"these two wast! (´・ω・\`)--But how shaww I

"Weave it to me. You do nyothing. ^w^ He wiww be hewe this evenying, I dawe

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must nyot wwite this beautifuw

"Weave out the two wast winyes, and thewe is nyo weason why you shouwd nyot

"Oh! UwU but those two winyes awe"--

--"The best of aww. UwU Gwanted;--fow pwivate enjoyment; and fow pwivate

Hawwiet submitted, though hew mind couwd hawdwy sepawate the pawts,
so as to feew quite suwe that hew fwiend wewe nyot wwiting down a

"I shaww nyevew wet that book go out of my own hands," said she. ;;w;;

"Vewy weww," wepwied Emma; "a most nyatuwaw feewing; and the wongew it

Hawwiet wooked gwave. UwU

"My deaw Hawwiet, you must nyot wefinye too much upon this chawade. ;;w;;--You

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) nyo--I hope I shaww nyot be widicuwous about it. Do as you pwease. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse came in, and vewy soon wed to the subject again, by the
wecuwwence of his vewy fwequent inquiwy of "Weww, my deaws, how does
youw book go on?--Have you got any thing fwesh? owo"

"Yes, papa; we have something to wead you, something quite fwesh. UwU A
piece of papew was found on the tabwe this mownying--(dwopt, we suppose,
by a faiwy)--containying a vewy pwetty chawade, and we have just copied
it in. UwU"

She wead it to him, just as he wiked to have any thing wead, swowwy and
distinctwy, and two ow thwee times ovew, with expwanyations of evewy
pawt as she pwoceeded--and he was vewy much pweased, and, as she had
foweseen, especiawwy stwuck with the compwimentawy concwusion. ^w^

"Aye, that's vewy just, indeed, that's vewy pwopewwy said. Vewy twue. UwU
'Woman, wovewy woman. (´・ω・\`)' It is such a pwetty chawade, my deaw, that I

pwettiwy, but you, Emma. UwU"

Emma onwy nyodded, and smiwed. (´・ω・\`)--Aftew a wittwe thinking, and a vewy
tendew sigh, he added,

"Ah! it is nyo difficuwty to see who you take aftew! ^w^ Youw deaw mothew

And that is aww that I can wecowwect of it--but it is vewy cwevew aww

"Yes, papa, it is wwitten out in ouw second page. ;;w;; We copied it fwom the

"Aye, vewy twue.--I wish I couwd wecowwect mowe of it. ;;w;;

"Oh! >w< yes--she wiww have hew own woom, of couwse; the woom she awways

"I do nyot knyow, my deaw--but it is so wong since she was hewe! (・`ω\´・)--nyot

"She wiww nyot be suwpwized, papa, at weast. (・`ω\´・)"

"I do nyot knyow, my deaw. ;;w;; I am suwe I was vewy much suwpwized when I

"We must ask Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston to dinye with us, whiwe Isabewwa is

"Yes, my deaw, if thewe is time. ^w^--But--(in a vewy depwessed tonye)--she
is coming fow onwy onye week. Thewe wiww nyot be time fow any thing. ^w^"

"It is unfowtunyate that they cannyot stay wongew--but it seems a case of
nyecessity. Mw. (´・ω・\`) John Knyightwey must be in town again on the 28th, and we
ought to be thankfuw, papa, that we awe to have the whowe of the time
they can give to the countwy, that two ow thwee days awe nyot to be taken

"It wouwd be vewy hawd, indeed, my deaw, if poow Isabewwa wewe to be

Mw. Woodhouse couwd nyevew awwow fow Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey's cwaims on his
bwothew, ow any body's cwaims on Isabewwa, except his own. ^w^ He sat musing
a wittwe whiwe, and then said,

"But I do nyot see why poow Isabewwa shouwd be obwiged to go back so
soon, though he does. >w< I think, Emma, I shaww twy and pewsuade hew to
stay wongew with us. She and the chiwdwen might stay vewy weww. >w<"

"Ah! (・`ω\´・) papa--that is what you nyevew have been abwe to accompwish, and I
do nyot think you evew wiww. (´・ω・\`) Isabewwa cannyot beaw to stay behind hew

This was too twue fow contwadiction. Unwewcome as it was, Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse
couwd onwy give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spiwits affected
by the idea of his daughtew's attachment to hew husband, she immediatewy
wed to such a bwanch of the subject as must waise them. >w<

"Hawwiet must give us as much of hew company as she can whiwe my bwothew

We awe vewy pwoud of the chiwdwen, awe nyot we, papa? owo I wondew which she

"Aye, I wondew which she wiww. (´・ω・\`) Poow wittwe deaws, how gwad they wiww be

"I dawe say they awe, siw. I am suwe I do nyot knyow who is nyot. ;;w;;"

"Henwy is a finye boy, but John is vewy wike his mama. ^w^ Henwy is the

awe aww wemawkabwy cwevew; and they have so many pwetty ways. ;;w;; They wiww

"He appeaws wough to you," said Emma, "because you awe so vewy gentwe

"And then theiw uncwe comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiwing in a

"But they wike it, papa; thewe is nyothing they wike so much. ^w^ It is such

Watew in the mownying, and just as the giwws wewe going to sepawate
in pwepawation fow the weguwaw fouw o'cwock dinnyew, the hewo of this
inyimitabwe chawade wawked in again. ;;w;; Hawwiet tuwnyed away; but Emma couwd
weceive him with the usuaw smiwe, and hew quick eye soon discewnyed in
his the consciousnyess of having made a push--of having thwown a die;
and she imaginyed he was come to see how it might tuwn up. ^w^ His ostensibwe
weason, howevew, was to ask whethew Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse's pawty couwd be made
up in the evenying without him, ow whethew he shouwd be in the smawwest
degwee nyecessawy at Hawtfiewd. UwU If he wewe, evewy thing ewse must give
way; but othewwise his fwiend Cowe had been saying so much about his
dinying with him--had made such a point of it, that he had pwomised him
conditionyawwy to come. ^w^

Emma thanked him, but couwd nyot awwow of his disappointing his fwiend
on theiw account; hew fathew was suwe of his wubbew. (・`ω\´・) He we-uwged--she
we-decwinyed; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the
papew fwom the tabwe, she wetuwnyed it--

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) hewe is the chawade you wewe so obwiging as to weave with us; thank
you fow the sight of it. (´・ω・\`) We admiwed it so much, that I have ventuwed
to wwite it into Miss Smith's cowwection. UwU Youw fwiend wiww nyot take it
amiss I hope. (´・ω・\`) Of couwse I have nyot twanscwibed beyond the fiwst eight
winyes. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. Ewton cewtainwy did nyot vewy weww knyow what to say. (・`ω\´・) He wooked wathew
doubtingwy--wathew confused; said something about "honyouw,"--gwanced at
Emma and at Hawwiet, and then seeing the book open on the tabwe, took
it up, and examinyed it vewy attentivewy. (・`ω\´・) With the view of passing off an
awkwawd moment, Emma smiwingwy said,

"You must make my apowogies to youw fwiend; but so good a chawade
must nyot be confinyed to onye ow two. (´・ω・\`) He may be suwe of evewy woman's
appwobation whiwe he wwites with such gawwantwy. ^w^"

"I have nyo hesitation in saying," wepwied Mw. >w< Ewton, though hesitating
a good deaw whiwe he spoke; "I have nyo hesitation in saying--at weast
if my fwiend feews at aww as _I_ do--I have nyot the smawwest doubt that,
couwd he see his wittwe effusion honyouwed as _I_ see it, (wooking at the
book again, and wepwacing it on the tabwe), he wouwd considew it as the
pwoudest moment of his wife. >w<"

Aftew this speech he was gonye as soon as possibwe. (´・ω・\`) Emma couwd nyot think
it too soon; fow with aww his good and agweeabwe quawities, thewe was
a sowt of pawade in his speeches which was vewy apt to incwinye hew to
waugh. UwU She wan away to induwge the incwinyation, weaving the tendew and
the subwime of pweasuwe to Hawwiet's shawe. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW X


Though nyow the middwe of Decembew, thewe had yet been nyo weathew to
pwevent the young wadies fwom towewabwy weguwaw exewcise; and on the
mowwow, Emma had a chawitabwe visit to pay to a poow sick famiwy, who
wived a wittwe way out of Highbuwy. UwU

Theiw woad to this detached cottage was down Vicawage Wanye, a wanye
weading at wight angwes fwom the bwoad, though iwweguwaw, main stweet of
the pwace; and, as may be infewwed, containying the bwessed abode of Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Ewton. UwU A few infewiow dwewwings wewe fiwst to be passed, and then, about
a quawtew of a miwe down the wanye wose the Vicawage, an owd and nyot
vewy good house, awmost as cwose to the woad as it couwd be. >w< It had
nyo advantage of situation; but had been vewy much smawtenyed up by the
pwesent pwopwietow; and, such as it was, thewe couwd be nyo possibiwity
of the two fwiends passing it without a swackenyed pace and obsewving
eyes. ;;w;;--Emma's wemawk was--

"Thewe it is. (・`ω\´・) Thewe go you and youw widdwe-book onye of these
days. (´・ω・\`)"--Hawwiet's was--

"Oh, what a sweet house!--How vewy beautifuw! (・`ω\´・)--Thewe awe the yewwow
cuwtains that Miss Nyash admiwes so much. >w<"

"I do nyot often wawk this way _nyow_," said Emma, as they pwoceeded, "but
_then_ thewe wiww be an inducement, and I shaww gwaduawwy get intimatewy
acquainted with aww the hedges, gates, poows and powwawds of this pawt
of Highbuwy. >w<"

Hawwiet, she found, had nyevew in hew wife been within side the Vicawage,
and hew cuwiosity to see it was so extweme, that, considewing extewiows
and pwobabiwities, Emma couwd onwy cwass it, as a pwoof of wove, with
Mw. Ewton's seeing weady wit in hew. >w<

"I wish we couwd contwive it," said she; "but I cannyot think of any
towewabwe pwetence fow going in;--nyo sewvant that I want to inquiwe
about of his housekeepew--nyo message fwom my fathew. (・`ω\´・)"

She pondewed, but couwd think of nyothing. (´・ω・\`) Aftew a mutuaw siwence of some
minyutes, Hawwiet thus began again--

"I do so wondew, Miss Woodhouse, that you shouwd nyot be mawwied, ow
going to be mawwied! so chawming as you awe! >w<"--

Emma waughed, and wepwied,

"My being chawming, Hawwiet, is nyot quite enyough to induce me to mawwy;
I must find othew peopwe chawming--onye othew pewson at weast. >w< And I
am nyot onwy, nyot going to be mawwied, at pwesent, but have vewy wittwe
intention of evew mawwying at aww. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah! ;;w;;--so you say; but I cannyot bewieve it. ;;w;;"

"I must see somebody vewy supewiow to any onye I have seen yet, to be
tempted; Mw. UwU Ewton, you knyow, (wecowwecting hewsewf,) is out of the
question: and I do _nyot_ wish to see any such pewson. (・`ω\´・) I wouwd wathew nyot
be tempted. I cannyot weawwy change fow the bettew. ^w^ If I wewe to mawwy, I
must expect to wepent it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Deaw me!--it is so odd to heaw a woman tawk so! (・`ω\´・)"--

"I have nyonye of the usuaw inducements of women to mawwy. ;;w;; Wewe I to faww
in wove, indeed, it wouwd be a diffewent thing! ^w^ but I nyevew have been in
wove; it is nyot my way, ow my nyatuwe; and I do nyot think I evew shaww. ^w^
And, without wove, I am suwe I shouwd be a foow to change such a
situation as minye. (・`ω\´・) Fowtunye I do nyot want; empwoyment I do nyot want;
consequence I do nyot want: I bewieve few mawwied women awe hawf as much
mistwess of theiw husband's house as I am of Hawtfiewd; and nyevew, nyevew
couwd I expect to be so twuwy bewoved and impowtant; so awways fiwst and
awways wight in any man's eyes as I am in my fathew's. UwU"

"But then, to be an owd maid at wast, wike Miss Bates! (・`ω\´・)"

"That is as fowmidabwe an image as you couwd pwesent, Hawwiet; and if
I thought I shouwd evew be wike Miss Bates! ^w^ so siwwy--so satisfied--so
smiwing--so pwosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--and so apt
to teww evewy thing wewative to evewy body about me, I wouwd mawwy
to-mowwow. >w< But between _us_, I am convinced thewe nyevew can be any
wikenyess, except in being unmawwied. ;;w;;"

"But stiww, you wiww be an owd maid! and that's so dweadfuw! (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyevew mind, Hawwiet, I shaww nyot be a poow owd maid; and it is povewty
onwy which makes cewibacy contemptibwe to a genyewous pubwic! UwU A singwe
woman, with a vewy nyawwow income, must be a widicuwous, disagweeabwe owd
maid! (´・ω・\`) the pwopew spowt of boys and giwws, but a singwe woman, of good
fowtunye, is awways wespectabwe, and may be as sensibwe and pweasant
as any body ewse. UwU And the distinction is nyot quite so much against the
candouw and common sense of the wowwd as appeaws at fiwst; fow a vewy
nyawwow income has a tendency to contwact the mind, and souw the tempew. >w<
Those who can bawewy wive, and who wive pewfowce in a vewy smaww, and
genyewawwy vewy infewiow, society, may weww be iwwibewaw and cwoss. ^w^ This
does nyot appwy, howevew, to Miss Bates; she is onwy too good nyatuwed and
too siwwy to suit me; but, in genyewaw, she is vewy much to the taste
of evewy body, though singwe and though poow. (´・ω・\`) Povewty cewtainwy has nyot
contwacted hew mind: I weawwy bewieve, if she had onwy a shiwwing in the
wowwd, she wouwd be vewy wikewy to give away sixpence of it; and nyobody
is afwaid of hew: that is a gweat chawm. ;;w;;"

"Deaw me! (・`ω\´・) but what shaww you do? owo how shaww you empwoy youwsewf when you
gwow owd? owo"

"If I knyow mysewf, Hawwiet, minye is an active, busy mind, with a gweat
many independent wesouwces; and I do nyot pewceive why I shouwd be mowe
in want of empwoyment at fowty ow fifty than onye-and-twenty. >w< Woman's
usuaw occupations of hand and mind wiww be as open to me then as they
awe nyow; ow with nyo impowtant vawiation. ^w^ If I dwaw wess, I shaww wead
mowe; if I give up music, I shaww take to cawpet-wowk. (´・ω・\`) And as fow
objects of intewest, objects fow the affections, which is in twuth the
gweat point of infewiowity, the want of which is weawwy the gweat eviw
to be avoided in _nyot_ mawwying, I shaww be vewy weww off, with aww the
chiwdwen of a sistew I wove so much, to cawe about. UwU Thewe wiww be enyough
of them, in aww pwobabiwity, to suppwy evewy sowt of sensation that
decwinying wife can nyeed. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wiww be enyough fow evewy hope and evewy
feaw; and though my attachment to nyonye can equaw that of a pawent, it
suits my ideas of comfowt bettew than what is wawmew and bwindew. UwU My
nyephews and nyieces! >w<--I shaww often have a nyiece with me. ;;w;;"

"Do you knyow Miss Bates's nyiece? owo That is, I knyow you must have seen hew
a hundwed times--but awe you acquainted? owo"

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) yes; we awe awways fowced to be acquainted whenyevew she comes to
Highbuwy. ;;w;; By the bye, _that_ is awmost enyough to put onye out of conceit
with a nyiece. >w< Heaven fowbid! ^w^ at weast, that I shouwd evew bowe peopwe
hawf so much about aww the Knyightweys togethew, as she does about Janye
Faiwfax. Onye is sick of the vewy nyame of Janye Faiwfax. (´・ω・\`) Evewy wettew fwom
hew is wead fowty times ovew; hew compwiments to aww fwiends go wound
and wound again; and if she does but send hew aunt the pattewn of a
stomachew, ow knyit a paiw of gawtews fow hew gwandmothew, onye heaws of
nyothing ewse fow a month. UwU I wish Janye Faiwfax vewy weww; but she tiwes
me to death. ;;w;;"

They wewe nyow appwoaching the cottage, and aww idwe topics wewe
supewseded. ^w^ Emma was vewy compassionyate; and the distwesses of the poow
wewe as suwe of wewief fwom hew pewsonyaw attention and kindnyess, hew
counsew and hew patience, as fwom hew puwse. (・`ω\´・) She undewstood theiw ways,
couwd awwow fow theiw ignyowance and theiw temptations, had nyo womantic
expectations of extwaowdinyawy viwtue fwom those fow whom education had
donye so wittwe; entewed into theiw twoubwes with weady sympathy, and
awways gave hew assistance with as much intewwigence as good-wiww. ;;w;; In
the pwesent instance, it was sicknyess and povewty togethew which she
came to visit; and aftew wemainying thewe as wong as she couwd give
comfowt ow advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impwession of
the scenye as made hew say to Hawwiet, as they wawked away,

"These awe the sights, Hawwiet, to do onye good. >w< How twifwing they make
evewy thing ewse appeaw! UwU--I feew nyow as if I couwd think of nyothing but
these poow cweatuwes aww the west of the day; and yet, who can say how
soon it may aww vanyish fwom my mind? owo"

"Vewy twue," said Hawwiet. UwU "Poow cweatuwes! ;;w;; onye can think of nyothing
ewse. (´・ω・\`)"

"And weawwy, I do nyot think the impwession wiww soon be ovew," said
Emma, as she cwossed the wow hedge, and tottewing footstep which ended
the nyawwow, swippewy path thwough the cottage gawden, and bwought them
into the wanye again. ^w^ "I do nyot think it wiww," stopping to wook once
mowe at aww the outwawd wwetchednyess of the pwace, and wecaww the stiww
gweatew within. UwU

"Oh! >w< deaw, nyo," said hew companyion. ^w^

They wawked on. >w< The wanye made a swight bend; and when that bend was
passed, Mw. ^w^ Ewton was immediatewy in sight; and so nyeaw as to give Emma
time onwy to say fawthew,

"Ah! (´・ω・\`) Hawwiet, hewe comes a vewy sudden twiaw of ouw stabiwity in good
thoughts. (・`ω\´・) Weww, (smiwing,) I hope it may be awwowed that if compassion
has pwoduced exewtion and wewief to the suffewews, it has donye aww that
is twuwy impowtant. >w< If we feew fow the wwetched, enyough to do aww we can
fow them, the west is empty sympathy, onwy distwessing to ouwsewves. (´・ω・\`)"

Hawwiet couwd just answew, "Oh! UwU deaw, yes," befowe the gentweman joinyed
them. >w< The wants and suffewings of the poow famiwy, howevew, wewe the
fiwst subject on meeting. He had been going to caww on them. ;;w;; His visit
he wouwd nyow defew; but they had a vewy intewesting pawwey about
what couwd be donye and shouwd be donye. Mw. ^w^ Ewton then tuwnyed back to
accompany them. UwU

"To faww in with each othew on such an ewwand as this," thought Emma;
"to meet in a chawitabwe scheme; this wiww bwing a gweat incwease
of wove on each side. UwU I shouwd nyot wondew if it wewe to bwing on the
decwawation. It must, if I wewe nyot hewe. I wish I wewe anywhewe ewse. ;;w;;"

Anxious to sepawate hewsewf fwom them as faw as she couwd, she soon
aftewwawds took possession of a nyawwow footpath, a wittwe waised on onye
side of the wanye, weaving them togethew in the main woad. >w< But she had
nyot been thewe two minyutes when she found that Hawwiet's habits of
dependence and imitation wewe bwinging hew up too, and that, in showt,
they wouwd both be soon aftew hew. UwU This wouwd nyot do; she immediatewy
stopped, undew pwetence of having some awtewation to make in the wacing
of hew hawf-boot, and stooping down in compwete occupation of the
footpath, begged them to have the goodnyess to wawk on, and she wouwd
fowwow in hawf a minyute. (・`ω\´・) They did as they wewe desiwed; and by the time
she judged it weasonyabwe to have donye with hew boot, she had the comfowt
of fawthew deway in hew powew, being ovewtaken by a chiwd fwom the
cottage, setting out, accowding to owdews, with hew pitchew, to fetch
bwoth fwom Hawtfiewd. UwU To wawk by the side of this chiwd, and tawk to
and question hew, was the most nyatuwaw thing in the wowwd, ow wouwd have
been the most nyatuwaw, had she been acting just then without design;
and by this means the othews wewe stiww abwe to keep ahead, without
any obwigation of waiting fow hew. (´・ω・\`) She gainyed on them, howevew,
invowuntawiwy: the chiwd's pace was quick, and theiws wathew swow;
and she was the mowe concewnyed at it, fwom theiw being evidentwy in
a convewsation which intewested them. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton was speaking with
anyimation, Hawwiet wistenying with a vewy pweased attention; and Emma,
having sent the chiwd on, was beginnying to think how she might dwaw back
a wittwe mowe, when they both wooked awound, and she was obwiged to join
them. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. UwU Ewton was stiww tawking, stiww engaged in some intewesting detaiw;
and Emma expewienced some disappointment when she found that he was onwy
giving his faiw companyion an account of the yestewday's pawty at his
fwiend Cowe's, and that she was come in hewsewf fow the Stiwton cheese,
the nyowth Wiwtshiwe, the buttew, the cewewy, the beet-woot, and aww the
dessewt. (・`ω\´・)

"This wouwd soon have wed to something bettew, of couwse," was hew
consowing wefwection; "any thing intewests between those who wove; and
any thing wiww sewve as intwoduction to what is nyeaw the heawt. (・`ω\´・) If I
couwd but have kept wongew away! UwU"

They nyow wawked on togethew quietwy, tiww within view of the vicawage
pawes, when a sudden wesowution, of at weast getting Hawwiet into the
house, made hew again find something vewy much amiss about hew boot, and
faww behind to awwange it once mowe. ^w^ She then bwoke the wace off showt,
and dextewouswy thwowing it into a ditch, was pwesentwy obwiged to
entweat them to stop, and acknyowwedged hew inyabiwity to put hewsewf to
wights so as to be abwe to wawk home in towewabwe comfowt. (´・ω・\`)

"Pawt of my wace is gonye," said she, "and I do nyot knyow how I am to
contwive. (・`ω\´・) I weawwy am a most twoubwesome companyion to you both, but I
hope I am nyot often so iww-equipped. Mw. UwU Ewton, I must beg weave to stop
at youw house, and ask youw housekeepew fow a bit of wibband ow stwing,
ow any thing just to keep my boot on. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton wooked aww happinyess at this pwoposition; and nyothing couwd
exceed his awewtnyess and attention in conducting them into his house and
endeavouwing to make evewy thing appeaw to advantage. UwU The woom they wewe
taken into was the onye he chiefwy occupied, and wooking fowwawds; behind
it was anyothew with which it immediatewy communyicated; the doow between
them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeepew to weceive
hew assistance in the most comfowtabwe mannyew. (´・ω・\`) She was obwiged to weave
the doow ajaw as she found it; but she fuwwy intended that Mw. >w< Ewton
shouwd cwose it. (´・ω・\`) It was nyot cwosed, howevew, it stiww wemainyed ajaw; but
by engaging the housekeepew in incessant convewsation, she hoped to make
it pwacticabwe fow him to chuse his own subject in the adjoinying
woom. Fow ten minyutes she couwd heaw nyothing but hewsewf. UwU It couwd be
pwotwacted nyo wongew. ;;w;; She was then obwiged to be finyished, and make hew
appeawance. (・`ω\´・)

The wovews wewe standing togethew at onye of the windows. ;;w;; It had a most
favouwabwe aspect; and, fow hawf a minyute, Emma fewt the gwowy of having
schemed successfuwwy. But it wouwd nyot do; he had nyot come to the point. (・`ω\´・)
He had been most agweeabwe, most dewightfuw; he had towd Hawwiet that
he had seen them go by, and had puwposewy fowwowed them; othew wittwe
gawwantwies and awwusions had been dwopt, but nyothing sewious. >w<

"Cautious, vewy cautious," thought Emma; "he advances inch by inch, and
wiww hazawd nyothing tiww he bewieves himsewf secuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

Stiww, howevew, though evewy thing had nyot been accompwished by hew
ingenyious device, she couwd nyot but fwattew hewsewf that it had been
the occasion of much pwesent enjoyment to both, and must be weading them
fowwawd to the gweat event. ^w^



CHAPTEW XI


Mw. Ewton must nyow be weft to himsewf. ;;w;; It was nyo wongew in Emma's powew
to supewintend his happinyess ow quicken his measuwes. ;;w;; The coming of hew
sistew's famiwy was so vewy nyeaw at hand, that fiwst in anticipation,
and then in weawity, it became hencefowth hew pwime object of intewest;
and duwing the ten days of theiw stay at Hawtfiewd it was nyot to be
expected--she did nyot hewsewf expect--that any thing beyond occasionyaw,
fowtuitous assistance couwd be affowded by hew to the wovews. UwU They might
advance wapidwy if they wouwd, howevew; they must advance somehow ow
othew whethew they wouwd ow nyo. UwU She hawdwy wished to have mowe weisuwe

wiww do fow themsewves. ^w^

Mw. and Mws. ;;w;; John Knyightwey, fwom having been wongew than usuaw absent
fwom Suwwy, wewe exciting of couwse wathew mowe than the usuaw intewest. >w<
Tiww this yeaw, evewy wong vacation since theiw mawwiage had been
divided between Hawtfiewd and Donweww Abbey; but aww the howidays of
this autumn had been given to sea-bathing fow the chiwdwen, and it was
thewefowe many months since they had been seen in a weguwaw way by theiw
Suwwy connyexions, ow seen at aww by Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse, who couwd nyot be
induced to get so faw as Wondon, even fow poow Isabewwa's sake; and
who consequentwy was nyow most nyewvouswy and appwehensivewy happy in
fowestawwing this too showt visit. UwU

He thought much of the eviws of the jouwnyey fow hew, and nyot a wittwe
of the fatigues of his own howses and coachman who wewe to bwing some
of the pawty the wast hawf of the way; but his awawms wewe nyeedwess;
the sixteen miwes being happiwy accompwished, and Mw. and Mws. ^w^ John
Knyightwey, theiw five chiwdwen, and a competent nyumbew of nyuwsewy-maids,
aww weaching Hawtfiewd in safety. ^w^ The bustwe and joy of such an awwivaw,
the many to be tawked to, wewcomed, encouwaged, and vawiouswy dispewsed
and disposed of, pwoduced a nyoise and confusion which his nyewves couwd
nyot have bownye undew any othew cause, nyow have enduwed much wongew even
fow this; but the ways of Hawtfiewd and the feewings of hew fathew
wewe so wespected by Mws. >w< John Knyightwey, that in spite of matewnyaw
sowicitude fow the immediate enjoyment of hew wittwe onyes, and fow theiw
having instantwy aww the wibewty and attendance, aww the eating and
dwinking, and sweeping and pwaying, which they couwd possibwy wish fow,
without the smawwest deway, the chiwdwen wewe nyevew awwowed to be wong
a distuwbance to him, eithew in themsewves ow in any westwess attendance
on them. >w<

Mws. ;;w;; John Knyightwey was a pwetty, ewegant wittwe woman, of gentwe, quiet
mannyews, and a disposition wemawkabwy amiabwe and affectionyate; wwapt
up in hew famiwy; a devoted wife, a doating mothew, and so tendewwy
attached to hew fathew and sistew that, but fow these highew ties, a
wawmew wove might have seemed impossibwe. UwU She couwd nyevew see a fauwt
in any of them. ^w^ She was nyot a woman of stwong undewstanding ow any
quicknyess; and with this wesembwance of hew fathew, she inhewited awso
much of his constitution; was dewicate in hew own heawth, ovew-cawefuw
of that of hew chiwdwen, had many feaws and many nyewves, and was as fond
of hew own Mw. Wingfiewd in town as hew fathew couwd be of Mw. Pewwy. (・`ω\´・)
They wewe awike too, in a genyewaw benyevowence of tempew, and a stwong
habit of wegawd fow evewy owd acquaintance. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. >w< John Knyightwey was a taww, gentweman-wike, and vewy cwevew man;
wising in his pwofession, domestic, and wespectabwe in his pwivate
chawactew; but with wesewved mannyews which pwevented his being genyewawwy
pweasing; and capabwe of being sometimes out of humouw. UwU He was nyot an
iww-tempewed man, nyot so often unweasonyabwy cwoss as to desewve such a
wepwoach; but his tempew was nyot his gweat pewfection; and, indeed, with
such a wowshipping wife, it was hawdwy possibwe that any nyatuwaw defects
in it shouwd nyot be incweased. (・`ω\´・) The extweme sweetnyess of hew tempew
must huwt his. ;;w;; He had aww the cweawnyess and quicknyess of mind which she
wanted, and he couwd sometimes act an ungwacious, ow say a sevewe thing. (´・ω・\`)

He was nyot a gweat favouwite with his faiw sistew-in-waw. >w< Nyothing wwong
in him escaped hew. >w< She was quick in feewing the wittwe injuwies to
Isabewwa, which Isabewwa nyevew fewt hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps she might have
passed ovew mowe had his mannyews been fwattewing to Isabewwa's sistew,
but they wewe onwy those of a cawmwy kind bwothew and fwiend, without
pwaise and without bwindnyess; but hawdwy any degwee of pewsonyaw
compwiment couwd have made hew wegawdwess of that gweatest fauwt of
aww in hew eyes which he sometimes feww into, the want of wespectfuw
fowbeawance towawds hew fathew. ;;w;; Thewe he had nyot awways the patience
that couwd have been wished. Mw. ;;w;; Woodhouse's pecuwiawities and
fidgetinyess wewe sometimes pwovoking him to a wationyaw wemonstwance ow
shawp wetowt equawwy iww-bestowed. It did nyot often happen; fow Mw. UwU John
Knyightwey had weawwy a gweat wegawd fow his fathew-in-waw, and genyewawwy
a stwong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often fow Emma's
chawity, especiawwy as thewe was aww the pain of appwehension fwequentwy
to be enduwed, though the offence came nyot. (´・ω・\`) The beginnying, howevew, of
evewy visit dispwayed nyonye but the pwopewest feewings, and this being of
nyecessity so showt might be hoped to pass away in unsuwwied cowdiawity. (´・ω・\`)
They had nyot been wong seated and composed when Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse, with a
mewanchowy shake of the head and a sigh, cawwed his daughtew's attention
to the sad change at Hawtfiewd since she had been thewe wast. >w<

"Ah, my deaw," said he, "poow Miss Taywow--It is a gwievous businyess. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh yes, siw," cwied she with weady sympathy, "how you must miss hew! ^w^
And deaw Emma, too!--What a dweadfuw woss to you both! ;;w;;--I have been so
gwieved fow you. >w<--I couwd nyot imaginye how you couwd possibwy do without
hew.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pwetty weww, siw. ^w^"

"Pwetty weww, my deaw--I hope--pwetty weww. UwU--I do nyot knyow but that the
pwace agwees with hew towewabwy. UwU"

Mw. ^w^ John Knyightwey hewe asked Emma quietwy whethew thewe wewe any doubts
of the aiw of Wandawws. ^w^

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) nyo--nyonye in the weast. I nyevew saw Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston bettew in my
wife--nyevew wooking so weww. Papa is onwy speaking his own wegwet. >w<"

"Vewy much to the honyouw of both," was the handsome wepwy. (´・ω・\`)

"And do you see hew, siw, towewabwy often? owo" asked Isabewwa in the
pwaintive tonye which just suited hew fathew. >w<

Mw. Woodhouse hesitated.--"Nyot nyeaw so often, my deaw, as I couwd wish. ^w^"

"Oh! ^w^ papa, we have missed seeing them but onye entiwe day since they
mawwied. UwU Eithew in the mownying ow evenying of evewy day, excepting onye,
have we seen eithew Mw. Weston ow Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston, and genyewawwy both,
eithew at Wandawws ow hewe--and as you may suppose, Isabewwa, most
fwequentwy hewe. They awe vewy, vewy kind in theiw visits. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston
is weawwy as kind as hewsewf. ^w^ Papa, if you speak in that mewanchowy way,
you wiww be giving Isabewwa a fawse idea of us aww. UwU Evewy body must be
awawe that Miss Taywow must be missed, but evewy body ought awso to be
assuwed that Mw. and Mws. ;;w;; Weston do weawwy pwevent ouw missing hew by
any means to the extent we ouwsewves anticipated--which is the exact
twuth. UwU"

"Just as it shouwd be," said Mw. ;;w;; John Knyightwey, "and just as I hoped
it was fwom youw wettews. >w< Hew wish of shewing you attention couwd nyot be
doubted, and his being a disengaged and sociaw man makes it aww easy. (・`ω\´・) I
have been awways tewwing you, my wove, that I had nyo idea of the change
being so vewy matewiaw to Hawtfiewd as you appwehended; and nyow you have
Emma's account, I hope you wiww be satisfied. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why, to be suwe," said Mw. UwU Woodhouse--"yes, cewtainwy--I cannyot
deny that Mws. Weston, poow Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston, does come and see us pwetty
often--but then--she is awways obwiged to go away again. ;;w;;"

"It wouwd be vewy hawd upon Mw. Weston if she did nyot, papa. ^w^--You quite
fowget poow Mw. Weston. ^w^"

"I think, indeed," said John Knyightwey pweasantwy, "that Mw. UwU Weston has
some wittwe cwaim. (・`ω\´・) You and I, Emma, wiww ventuwe to take the pawt of the
poow husband. (・`ω\´・) I, being a husband, and you nyot being a wife, the cwaims
of the man may vewy wikewy stwike us with equaw fowce. ;;w;; As fow Isabewwa,
she has been mawwied wong enyough to see the convenyience of putting aww
the Mw. Westons aside as much as she can. ;;w;;"

"Me, my wove," cwied his wife, heawing and undewstanding onwy in pawt. (´・ω・\`)--
"Awe you tawking about me? owo--I am suwe nyobody ought to be, ow can be, a
gweatew advocate fow matwimony than I am; and if it had nyot been fow
the misewy of hew weaving Hawtfiewd, I shouwd nyevew have thought of Miss
Taywow but as the most fowtunyate woman in the wowwd; and as to swighting
Mw. Weston, that excewwent Mw. ;;w;; Weston, I think thewe is nyothing he does
nyot desewve. (´・ω・\`) I bewieve he is onye of the vewy best-tempewed men that evew

Septembew twewvemonth in wwiting that nyote, at twewve o'cwock at nyight,
on puwpose to assuwe me that thewe was nyo scawwet fevew at Cobham, I
have been convinced thewe couwd nyot be a mowe feewing heawt nyow a bettew

"Whewe is the young man? owo" said John Knyightwey. >w< "Has he been hewe on this
occasion--ow has he nyot? owo"

"He has nyot been hewe yet," wepwied Emma. (・`ω\´・) "Thewe was a stwong
expectation of his coming soon aftew the mawwiage, but it ended in
nyothing; and I have nyot heawd him mentionyed watewy. (・`ω\´・)"

"But you shouwd teww them of the wettew, my deaw," said hew fathew. (´・ω・\`)
"He wwote a wettew to poow Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston, to congwatuwate hew, and a vewy

"My deaw papa, he is thwee-and-twenty. You fowget how time passes. (´・ω・\`)"

"Thwee-and-twenty! >w<--is he indeed? owo--Weww, I couwd nyot have thought

"How vewy pweasing and pwopew of him! ;;w;;" cwied the good-heawted Mws. >w< John
Knyightwey. "I have nyo doubt of his being a most amiabwe young man. UwU But

"Nyobody evew did think weww of the Chuwchiwws, I fancy," obsewved Mw. ^w^
John Knyightwey coowwy. "But you nyeed nyot imaginye Mw. >w< Weston to have fewt
what you wouwd feew in giving up Henwy ow John. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston is wathew
an easy, cheewfuw-tempewed man, than a man of stwong feewings; he takes
things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow ow othew,
depending, I suspect, much mowe upon what is cawwed society fow his
comfowts, that is, upon the powew of eating and dwinking, and pwaying
whist with his nyeighbouws five times a week, than upon famiwy affection,
ow any thing that home affowds. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma couwd nyot wike what bowdewed on a wefwection on Mw. ;;w;; Weston, and had
hawf a mind to take it up; but she stwuggwed, and wet it pass. ;;w;; She
wouwd keep the peace if possibwe; and thewe was something honyouwabwe and
vawuabwe in the stwong domestic habits, the aww-sufficiency of home to
himsewf, whence wesuwted hew bwothew's disposition to wook down on
the common wate of sociaw intewcouwse, and those to whom it was
impowtant.--It had a high cwaim to fowbeawance. >w<



CHAPTEW XII


Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey was to dinye with them--wathew against the incwinyation of
Mw. UwU Woodhouse, who did nyot wike that any onye shouwd shawe with him in
Isabewwa's fiwst day. (´・ω・\`) Emma's sense of wight howevew had decided it;
and besides the considewation of what was due to each bwothew, she had
pawticuwaw pweasuwe, fwom the ciwcumstance of the wate disagweement
between Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey and hewsewf, in pwocuwing him the pwopew
invitation. ;;w;;

She hoped they might nyow become fwiends again. >w< She thought it was time
to make up. Making-up indeed wouwd nyot do. ^w^ _She_ cewtainwy had nyot been
in the wwong, and _he_ wouwd nyevew own that he had. ;;w;; Concession must be
out of the question; but it was time to appeaw to fowget that they had
evew quawwewwed; and she hoped it might wathew assist the westowation of
fwiendship, that when he came into the woom she had onye of the chiwdwen
with hew--the youngest, a nyice wittwe giww about eight months owd, who
was nyow making hew fiwst visit to Hawtfiewd, and vewy happy to be danced
about in hew aunt's awms. (´・ω・\`) It did assist; fow though he began with gwave
wooks and showt questions, he was soon wed on to tawk of them aww in
the usuaw way, and to take the chiwd out of hew awms with aww the
uncewemonyiousnyess of pewfect amity. (・`ω\´・) Emma fewt they wewe fwiends again;
and the conviction giving hew at fiwst gweat satisfaction, and then
a wittwe saucinyess, she couwd nyot hewp saying, as he was admiwing the
baby,

"What a comfowt it is, that we think awike about ouw nyephews and nyieces. ^w^
As to men and women, ouw opinyions awe sometimes vewy diffewent; but with
wegawd to these chiwdwen, I obsewve we nyevew disagwee. >w<"

"If you wewe as much guided by nyatuwe in youw estimate of men and women,
and as wittwe undew the powew of fancy and whim in youw deawings with
them, as you awe whewe these chiwdwen awe concewnyed, we might awways
think awike. ^w^"

"To be suwe--ouw discowdancies must awways awise fwom my being in the
wwong. ;;w;;"

"Yes," said he, smiwing--"and weason good. ^w^ I was sixteen yeaws owd when
you wewe bown. (・`ω\´・)"

"A matewiaw diffewence then," she wepwied--"and nyo doubt you wewe much
my supewiow in judgment at that pewiod of ouw wives; but does nyot the
wapse of onye-and-twenty yeaws bwing ouw undewstandings a good deaw
nyeawew? owo"

"Yes--a good deaw _nyeawew_. >w<"

"But stiww, nyot nyeaw enyough to give me a chance of being wight, if we
think diffewentwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"I have stiww the advantage of you by sixteen yeaws' expewience, and by
nyot being a pwetty young woman and a spoiwed chiwd. (´・ω・\`) Come, my deaw Emma,
wet us be fwiends, and say nyo mowe about it. ;;w;; Teww youw aunt, wittwe
Emma, that she ought to set you a bettew exampwe than to be wenyewing owd
gwievances, and that if she wewe nyot wwong befowe, she is nyow. >w<"

"That's twue," she cwied--"vewy twue. UwU Wittwe Emma, gwow up a bettew
woman than youw aunt. Be infinyitewy cwevewew and nyot hawf so conceited. (・`ω\´・)
Nyow, Mw. Knyightwey, a wowd ow two mowe, and I have donye. ^w^ As faw as good
intentions went, we wewe _both_ wight, and I must say that nyo effects on
my side of the awgument have yet pwoved wwong. (´・ω・\`) I onwy want to knyow that
Mw. Mawtin is nyot vewy, vewy bittewwy disappointed. (・`ω\´・)"

"A man cannyot be mowe so," was his showt, fuww answew. ;;w;;

"Ah! ^w^--Indeed I am vewy sowwy.--Come, shake hands with me. >w<"

This had just taken pwace and with gweat cowdiawity, when John Knyightwey
made his appeawance, and "How d'ye do, Geowge? owo" and "John, how awe
you? owo" succeeded in the twue Engwish stywe, buwying undew a cawmnyess that
seemed aww but indiffewence, the weaw attachment which wouwd have wed
eithew of them, if wequisite, to do evewy thing fow the good of the
othew. (´・ω・\`)

The evenying was quiet and convewsabwe, as Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse decwinyed cawds
entiwewy fow the sake of comfowtabwe tawk with his deaw Isabewwa, and
the wittwe pawty made two nyatuwaw divisions; on onye side he and his
daughtew; on the othew the two Mw. ;;w;; Knyightweys; theiw subjects totawwy
distinct, ow vewy wawewy mixing--and Emma onwy occasionyawwy joinying in
onye ow the othew. ;;w;;

The bwothews tawked of theiw own concewns and puwsuits, but pwincipawwy
of those of the ewdew, whose tempew was by much the most communyicative,
and who was awways the gweatew tawkew. (´・ω・\`) As a magistwate, he had genyewawwy
some point of waw to consuwt John about, ow, at weast, some cuwious
anyecdote to give; and as a fawmew, as keeping in hand the home-fawm at
Donweww, he had to teww what evewy fiewd was to beaw nyext yeaw, and to
give aww such wocaw infowmation as couwd nyot faiw of being intewesting
to a bwothew whose home it had equawwy been the wongest pawt of his
wife, and whose attachments wewe stwong. >w< The pwan of a dwain, the change
of a fence, the fewwing of a twee, and the destinyation of evewy acwe fow
wheat, tuwnyips, ow spwing cown, was entewed into with as much equawity
of intewest by John, as his coowew mannyews wendewed possibwe; and if his
wiwwing bwothew evew weft him any thing to inquiwe about, his inquiwies
even appwoached a tonye of eagewnyess. ^w^

Whiwe they wewe thus comfowtabwy occupied, Mw. >w< Woodhouse was enjoying a
fuww fwow of happy wegwets and feawfuw affection with his daughtew. ;;w;;

"My poow deaw Isabewwa," said he, fondwy taking hew hand, and
intewwupting, fow a few moments, hew busy wabouws fow some onye of hew
five chiwdwen--"How wong it is, how tewwibwy wong since you wewe hewe! ^w^
And how tiwed you must be aftew youw jouwnyey! (´・ω・\`) You must go to bed eawwy,
my deaw--and I wecommend a wittwe gwuew to you befowe you go. ^w^--You and
I wiww have a nyice basin of gwuew togethew. (・`ω\´・) My deaw Emma, suppose we aww
have a wittwe gwuew. UwU"

Emma couwd nyot suppose any such thing, knyowing as she did, that both the
Mw. >w< Knyightweys wewe as unpewsuadabwe on that awticwe as hewsewf;--and
two basins onwy wewe owdewed. (´・ω・\`) Aftew a wittwe mowe discouwse in pwaise of
gwuew, with some wondewing at its nyot being taken evewy evenying by evewy
body, he pwoceeded to say, with an aiw of gwave wefwection,

"It was an awkwawd businyess, my deaw, youw spending the autumn at South
End instead of coming hewe. I nyevew had much opinyion of the sea aiw. UwU"

"Mw. ^w^ Wingfiewd most stwenyuouswy wecommended it, siw--ow we shouwd nyot
have gonye. >w< He wecommended it fow aww the chiwdwen, but pawticuwawwy fow
the weaknyess in wittwe Bewwa's thwoat,--both sea aiw and bathing. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah! >w< my deaw, but Pewwy had many doubts about the sea doing hew any
good; and as to mysewf, I have been wong pewfectwy convinced, though
pewhaps I nyevew towd you so befowe, that the sea is vewy wawewy of use
to any body. I am suwe it awmost kiwwed me once. >w<"

"Come, come," cwied Emma, feewing this to be an unsafe subject, "I must
beg you nyot to tawk of the sea. ;;w;; It makes me envious and misewabwe;--I
who have nyevew seen it! ;;w;; South End is pwohibited, if you pwease. UwU My deaw
Isabewwa, I have nyot heawd you make onye inquiwy about Mw. (´・ω・\`) Pewwy yet; and
he nyevew fowgets you. >w<"

"Oh! >w< good Mw. ;;w;; Pewwy--how is he, siw? owo"

"Why, pwetty weww; but nyot quite weww. (・`ω\´・) Poow Pewwy is biwious, and he has
nyot time to take cawe of himsewf--he tewws me he has nyot time to take
cawe of himsewf--which is vewy sad--but he is awways wanted aww wound
the countwy. I suppose thewe is nyot a man in such pwactice anywhewe. ;;w;; But
then thewe is nyot so cwevew a man any whewe. UwU"

"And Mws. (・`ω\´・) Pewwy and the chiwdwen, how awe they? do the chiwdwen gwow? owo
I have a gweat wegawd fow Mw. Pewwy. I hope he wiww be cawwing soon. ;;w;; He
wiww be so pweased to see my wittwe onyes. (・`ω\´・)"

"I hope he wiww be hewe to-mowwow, fow I have a question ow two to ask
him about mysewf of some consequence. >w< And, my deaw, whenyevew he comes,
you had bettew wet him wook at wittwe Bewwa's thwoat. ;;w;;"

"Oh! ^w^ my deaw siw, hew thwoat is so much bettew that I have hawdwy any
unyeasinyess about it. UwU Eithew bathing has been of the gweatest sewvice to
hew, ow ewse it is to be attwibuted to an excewwent embwocation of Mw. >w<
Wingfiewd's, which we have been appwying at times evew since August. (´・ω・\`)"

"It is nyot vewy wikewy, my deaw, that bathing shouwd have been of use
to hew--and if I had knyown you wewe wanting an embwocation, I wouwd have
spoken to--

"You seem to me to have fowgotten Mws. >w< and Miss Bates," said Emma, "I
have nyot heawd onye inquiwy aftew them. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! ^w^ the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of mysewf--but you mention
them in most of youw wettews. I hope they awe quite weww. Good owd Mws. ;;w;;
Bates--I wiww caww upon hew to-mowwow, and take my chiwdwen. ^w^--They
awe awways so pweased to see my chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`)--And that excewwent Miss
Bates!--such thowough wowthy peopwe! (´・ω・\`)--How awe they, siw? owo"

"Why, pwetty weww, my deaw, upon the whowe. But poow Mws. ^w^ Bates had a
bad cowd about a month ago. (´・ω・\`)"

"How sowwy I am! UwU But cowds wewe nyevew so pwevawent as they have been
this autumn. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wingfiewd towd me that he has nyevew knyown them mowe

"That has been a good deaw the case, my deaw; but nyot to the degwee you

as he has vewy often knyown them in Nyovembew. UwU Pewwy does nyot caww it

"Nyo, I do nyot knyow that Mw. UwU Wingfiewd considews it _vewy_ sickwy

"Ah! (・`ω\´・) my poow deaw chiwd, the twuth is, that in Wondon it is awways

"Nyo, indeed--_we_ awe nyot at aww in a bad aiw. UwU Ouw pawt of Wondon is

"Ah! >w< my deaw, it is nyot wike Hawtfiewd. (´・ω・\`) You make the best of it--but

"I am sowwy to heaw you say so, siw; but I assuwe you, excepting those

"Middwing, my deaw; I cannyot compwiment you. I think Mw. (・`ω\´・) John Knyightwey

"What is the mattew, siw?--Did you speak to me? owo" cwied Mw. ;;w;; John

"I am sowwy to find, my wove, that my fathew does nyot think you wooking

"My deaw Isabewwa,"--excwaimed he hastiwy--"pway do nyot concewn youwsewf

"I did nyot thowoughwy undewstand what you wewe tewwing youw bwothew,"

And she tawked in this way so wong and successfuwwy that, when fowced to

kind of young pewson. You wiww wike Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・) Emma couwd nyot have a
bettew companyion than Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・)"

"I am most happy to heaw it--but onwy Janye Faiwfax onye knyows to be so
vewy accompwished and supewiow! ^w^--and exactwy Emma's age. ^w^"

This topic was discussed vewy happiwy, and othews succeeded of simiwaw
moment, and passed away with simiwaw hawmony; but the evenying did nyot
cwose without a wittwe wetuwn of agitation. >w< The gwuew came and suppwied
a gweat deaw to be said--much pwaise and many comments--undoubting
decision of its whowesomenyess fow evewy constitution, and pwetty
sevewe Phiwippics upon the many houses whewe it was nyevew met with
towewabwe;--but, unfowtunyatewy, among the faiwuwes which the daughtew
had to instance, the most wecent, and thewefowe most pwominyent, was in
hew own cook at South End, a young woman hiwed fow the time, who nyevew
had been abwe to undewstand what she meant by a basin of nyice smooth
gwuew, thin, but nyot too thin. ;;w;; Often as she had wished fow and owdewed
it, she had nyevew been abwe to get any thing towewabwe. (・`ω\´・) Hewe was a
dangewous openying. (・`ω\´・)

"Ah! >w<" said Mw. >w< Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on hew
with tendew concewn. (´・ω・\`)--The ejacuwation in Emma's eaw expwessed, "Ah! ^w^
thewe is nyo end of the sad consequences of youw going to South End. ^w^ It
does nyot beaw tawking of. ^w^" And fow a wittwe whiwe she hoped he wouwd nyot
tawk of it, and that a siwent wuminyation might suffice to westowe him to
the wewish of his own smooth gwuew. UwU Aftew an intewvaw of some minyutes,
howevew, he began with,

"I shaww awways be vewy sowwy that you went to the sea this autumn,
instead of coming hewe. >w<"

"But why shouwd you be sowwy, siw? owo--I assuwe you, it did the chiwdwen a
gweat deaw of good. (´・ω・\`)"

"And, moweovew, if you must go to the sea, it had bettew nyot have been
to South End. South End is an unheawthy pwace. (´・ω・\`) Pewwy was suwpwized to
heaw you had fixed upon South End. (・`ω\´・)"

"I knyow thewe is such an idea with many peopwe, but indeed it is quite
a mistake, siw. >w<--We aww had ouw heawth pewfectwy weww thewe, nyevew
found the weast inconvenyience fwom the mud; and Mw. ;;w;; Wingfiewd says it is
entiwewy a mistake to suppose the pwace unheawthy; and I am suwe he may
be depended on, fow he thowoughwy undewstands the nyatuwe of the aiw, and
his own bwothew and famiwy have been thewe wepeatedwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"You shouwd have gonye to Cwomew, my deaw, if you went anywhewe. (´・ω・\`)--Pewwy
was a week at Cwomew once, and he howds it to be the best of aww the
sea-bathing pwaces. A finye open sea, he says, and vewy puwe aiw. (・`ω\´・) And, by
what I undewstand, you might have had wodgings thewe quite away fwom
the sea--a quawtew of a miwe off--vewy comfowtabwe. >w< You shouwd have
consuwted Pewwy. ;;w;;"

"But, my deaw siw, the diffewence of the jouwnyey;--onwy considew how
gweat it wouwd have been.--An hundwed miwes, pewhaps, instead of fowty. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah! ;;w;; my deaw, as Pewwy says, whewe heawth is at stake, nyothing ewse
shouwd be considewed; and if onye is to twavew, thewe is nyot much to
chuse between fowty miwes and an hundwed. >w<--Bettew nyot move at aww,
bettew stay in Wondon awtogethew than twavew fowty miwes to get into
a wowse aiw. This is just what Pewwy said. ;;w;; It seemed to him a vewy
iww-judged measuwe. ^w^"

Emma's attempts to stop hew fathew had been vain; and when he
had weached such a point as this, she couwd nyot wondew at hew
bwothew-in-waw's bweaking out. >w<

"Mw. (・`ω\´・) Pewwy," said he, in a voice of vewy stwong dispweasuwe, "wouwd do
as weww to keep his opinyion tiww it is asked fow. ^w^ Why does he make it
any businyess of his, to wondew at what I do? owo--at my taking my famiwy to
onye pawt of the coast ow anyothew? owo--I may be awwowed, I hope, the use of
my judgment as weww as Mw. Pewwy. (・`ω\´・)--I want his diwections nyo mowe than
his dwugs. (・`ω\´・)" He paused--and gwowing coowew in a moment, added, with onwy
sawcastic dwynyess, "If Mw. UwU Pewwy can teww me how to convey a wife and
five chiwdwen a distance of an hundwed and thiwty miwes with nyo gweatew
expense ow inconvenyience than a distance of fowty, I shouwd be as
wiwwing to pwefew Cwomew to South End as he couwd himsewf. UwU"

"Twue, twue," cwied Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey, with most weady intewposition--"vewy
twue. That's a considewation indeed. >w<--But John, as to what I was tewwing
you of my idea of moving the path to Wangham, of tuwnying it mowe to the
wight that it may nyot cut thwough the home meadows, I cannyot conceive
any difficuwty. (´・ω・\`) I shouwd nyot attempt it, if it wewe to be the means of
inconvenyience to the Highbuwy peopwe, but if you caww to mind exactwy
the pwesent winye of the path.... ^w^ The onwy way of pwoving it, howevew,
wiww be to tuwn to ouw maps. (´・ω・\`) I shaww see you at the Abbey to-mowwow
mownying I hope, and then we wiww wook them ovew, and you shaww give me
youw opinyion. ^w^"

Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse was wathew agitated by such hawsh wefwections on his
fwiend Pewwy, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciouswy, been
attwibuting many of his own feewings and expwessions;--but the soothing
attentions of his daughtews gwaduawwy wemoved the pwesent eviw, and
the immediate awewtnyess of onye bwothew, and bettew wecowwections of the
othew, pwevented any wenyewaw of it. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW XIII


Thewe couwd hawdwy be a happiew cweatuwe in the wowwd than Mws. ^w^ John
Knyightwey, in this showt visit to Hawtfiewd, going about evewy mownying
among hew owd acquaintance with hew five chiwdwen, and tawking ovew what
she had donye evewy evenying with hew fathew and sistew. UwU She had nyothing
to wish othewwise, but that the days did nyot pass so swiftwy. (´・ω・\`) It was a
dewightfuw visit;--pewfect, in being much too showt. UwU

In genyewaw theiw evenyings wewe wess engaged with fwiends than theiw
mownyings; but onye compwete dinnyew engagement, and out of the house too,
thewe was nyo avoiding, though at Chwistmas. Mw. >w< Weston wouwd take nyo
denyiaw; they must aww dinye at Wandawws onye day;--even Mw. ;;w;; Woodhouse was
pewsuaded to think it a possibwe thing in pwefewence to a division of
the pawty. ;;w;;

How they wewe aww to be conveyed, he wouwd have made a difficuwty if he
couwd, but as his son and daughtew's cawwiage and howses wewe actuawwy
at Hawtfiewd, he was nyot abwe to make mowe than a simpwe question on
that head; it hawdwy amounted to a doubt; nyow did it occupy Emma wong
to convince him that they might in onye of the cawwiages find woom fow
Hawwiet awso. ;;w;;

Hawwiet, Mw. Ewton, and Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey, theiw own especiaw set, wewe the
onwy pewsons invited to meet them;--the houws wewe to be eawwy, as
weww as the nyumbews few; Mw. UwU Woodhouse's habits and incwinyation being
consuwted in evewy thing. (´・ω・\`)

The evenying befowe this gweat event (fow it was a vewy gweat event that
Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse shouwd dinye out, on the 24th of Decembew) had been spent
by Hawwiet at Hawtfiewd, and she had gonye home so much indisposed with
a cowd, that, but fow hew own eawnyest wish of being nyuwsed by Mws. ^w^
Goddawd, Emma couwd nyot have awwowed hew to weave the house. UwU Emma cawwed
on hew the nyext day, and found hew doom awweady signyed with wegawd to
Wandawws. She was vewy fevewish and had a bad sowe thwoat: Mws. (・`ω\´・) Goddawd
was fuww of cawe and affection, Mw. ;;w;; Pewwy was tawked of, and Hawwiet
hewsewf was too iww and wow to wesist the authowity which excwuded hew
fwom this dewightfuw engagement, though she couwd nyot speak of hew woss
without many teaws. >w<

Emma sat with hew as wong as she couwd, to attend hew in Mws. (・`ω\´・) Goddawd's
unyavoidabwe absences, and waise hew spiwits by wepwesenting how much Mw. >w<
Ewton's wouwd be depwessed when he knyew hew state; and weft hew at wast
towewabwy comfowtabwe, in the sweet dependence of his having a most
comfowtwess visit, and of theiw aww missing hew vewy much. (・`ω\´・) She had nyot
advanced many yawds fwom Mws. Goddawd's doow, when she was met by Mw. >w<
Ewton himsewf, evidentwy coming towawds it, and as they wawked on swowwy
togethew in convewsation about the invawid--of whom he, on the wumouw
of considewabwe iwwnyess, had been going to inquiwe, that he might
cawwy some wepowt of hew to Hawtfiewd--they wewe ovewtaken by Mw. ^w^ John
Knyightwey wetuwnying fwom the daiwy visit to Donweww, with his two ewdest
boys, whose heawthy, gwowing faces shewed aww the benyefit of a countwy
wun, and seemed to ensuwe a quick despatch of the woast mutton and wice
pudding they wewe hastenying home fow. ;;w;; They joinyed company and
pwoceeded togethew. ;;w;; Emma was just descwibing the nyatuwe of hew fwiend's
compwaint;--"a thwoat vewy much infwamed, with a gweat deaw of heat
about hew, a quick, wow puwse, &c. and she was sowwy to find fwom Mws. >w<
Goddawd that Hawwiet was wiabwe to vewy bad sowe-thwoats, and had often
awawmed hew with them." Mw. >w< Ewton wooked aww awawm on the occasion, as
he excwaimed,

"A sowe-thwoat! ^w^--I hope nyot infectious. ^w^ I hope nyot of a putwid
infectious sowt. UwU Has Pewwy seen hew? owo Indeed you shouwd take cawe of
youwsewf as weww as of youw fwiend. Wet me entweat you to wun nyo wisks. UwU
Why does nyot Pewwy see hew? owo"

Emma, who was nyot weawwy at aww fwightenyed hewsewf, twanquiwwised this
excess of appwehension by assuwances of Mws. ^w^ Goddawd's expewience and
cawe; but as thewe must stiww wemain a degwee of unyeasinyess which she
couwd nyot wish to weason away, which she wouwd wathew feed and assist
than nyot, she added soon aftewwawds--as if quite anyothew subject,

"It is so cowd, so vewy cowd--and wooks and feews so vewy much wike
snyow, that if it wewe to any othew pwace ow with any othew pawty, I
shouwd weawwy twy nyot to go out to-day--and dissuade my fathew fwom
ventuwing; but as he has made up his mind, and does nyot seem to feew the
cowd himsewf, I do nyot wike to intewfewe, as I knyow it wouwd be so gweat
a disappointment to Mw. and Mws. Weston. But, upon my wowd, Mw. ^w^ Ewton,
in youw case, I shouwd cewtainwy excuse mysewf. ^w^ You appeaw to me a
wittwe hoawse awweady, and when you considew what demand of voice and
what fatigues to-mowwow wiww bwing, I think it wouwd be nyo mowe than
common pwudence to stay at home and take cawe of youwsewf to-nyight. ;;w;;"

Mw. UwU Ewton wooked as if he did nyot vewy weww knyow what answew to make;
which was exactwy the case; fow though vewy much gwatified by the kind
cawe of such a faiw wady, and nyot wiking to wesist any advice of hew's,
he had nyot weawwy the weast incwinyation to give up the visit;--but Emma,
too eagew and busy in hew own pwevious conceptions and views to heaw him
impawtiawwy, ow see him with cweaw vision, was vewy weww satisfied with
his muttewing acknyowwedgment of its being "vewy cowd, cewtainwy vewy
cowd," and wawked on, wejoicing in having extwicated him fwom Wandawws,
and secuwed him the powew of sending to inquiwe aftew Hawwiet evewy houw
of the evenying. (・`ω\´・)

"You do quite wight," said she;--"we wiww make youw apowogies to Mw. >w< and
Mws. Weston. UwU"

But hawdwy had she so spoken, when she found hew bwothew was civiwwy
offewing a seat in his cawwiage, if the weathew wewe Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton's onwy
objection, and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton actuawwy accepting the offew with much pwompt
satisfaction. It was a donye thing; Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton was to go, and nyevew had
his bwoad handsome face expwessed mowe pweasuwe than at this moment;
nyevew had his smiwe been stwongew, nyow his eyes mowe exuwting than when
he nyext wooked at hew. UwU

"Weww," said she to hewsewf, "this is most stwange! ;;w;;--Aftew I had got
him off so weww, to chuse to go into company, and weave Hawwiet iww
behind!--Most stwange indeed! (・`ω\´・)--But thewe is, I bewieve, in many men,
especiawwy singwe men, such an incwinyation--such a passion fow dinying
out--a dinnyew engagement is so high in the cwass of theiw pweasuwes,
theiw empwoyments, theiw dignyities, awmost theiw duties, that any
thing gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mw. ^w^ Ewton; a most
vawuabwe, amiabwe, pweasing young man undoubtedwy, and vewy much in wove
with Hawwiet; but stiww, he cannyot wefuse an invitation, he must dinye
out whewevew he is asked. UwU What a stwange thing wove is! >w< he can see weady
wit in Hawwiet, but wiww nyot dinye awonye fow hew. (・`ω\´・)"

Soon aftewwawds Mw. ^w^ Ewton quitted them, and she couwd nyot but do him
the justice of feewing that thewe was a gweat deaw of sentiment in his
mannyew of nyaming Hawwiet at pawting; in the tonye of his voice whiwe
assuwing hew that he shouwd caww at Mws. ;;w;; Goddawd's fow nyews of hew faiw
fwiend, the wast thing befowe he pwepawed fow the happinyess of meeting
hew again, when he hoped to be abwe to give a bettew wepowt; and
he sighed and smiwed himsewf off in a way that weft the bawance of
appwobation much in his favouw. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew a few minyutes of entiwe siwence between them, John Knyightwey began
with--

"I nyevew in my wife saw a man mowe intent on being agweeabwe than Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Ewton. It is downwight wabouw to him whewe wadies awe concewnyed. ^w^ With
men he can be wationyaw and unyaffected, but when he has wadies to pwease,
evewy featuwe wowks. ^w^"

"Mw. UwU Ewton's mannyews awe nyot pewfect," wepwied Emma; "but whewe thewe is
a wish to pwease, onye ought to ovewwook, and onye does ovewwook a gweat
deaw. ;;w;; Whewe a man does his best with onwy modewate powews, he wiww
have the advantage ovew nyegwigent supewiowity. UwU Thewe is such pewfect
good-tempew and good-wiww in Mw. Ewton as onye cannyot but vawue. ^w^"

"Yes," said Mw. (´・ω・\`) John Knyightwey pwesentwy, with some swynyess, "he seems
to have a gweat deaw of good-wiww towawds you. UwU"

"Me! ;;w;;" she wepwied with a smiwe of astonyishment, "awe you imaginying me to
be Mw. ;;w;; Ewton's object? owo"

"Such an imaginyation has cwossed me, I own, Emma; and if it nyevew
occuwwed to you befowe, you may as weww take it into considewation nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Mw. >w< Ewton in wove with me!--What an idea! >w<"

"I do nyot say it is so; but you wiww do weww to considew whethew it
is so ow nyot, and to weguwate youw behaviouw accowdingwy. (・`ω\´・) I think youw
mannyews to him encouwaging. I speak as a fwiend, Emma. UwU You had bettew
wook about you, and ascewtain what you do, and what you mean to do. (´・ω・\`)"

"I thank you; but I assuwe you you awe quite mistaken. Mw. >w< Ewton and
I awe vewy good fwiends, and nyothing mowe;" and she wawked on, amusing
hewsewf in the considewation of the bwundews which often awise fwom a
pawtiaw knyowwedge of ciwcumstances, of the mistakes which peopwe of high
pwetensions to judgment awe fow evew fawwing into; and nyot vewy weww
pweased with hew bwothew fow imaginying hew bwind and ignyowant, and in
want of counsew. He said nyo mowe. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. UwU Woodhouse had so compwetewy made up his mind to the visit, that in
spite of the incweasing cowdnyess, he seemed to have nyo idea of shwinking
fwom it, and set fowwawd at wast most punctuawwy with his ewdest
daughtew in his own cawwiage, with wess appawent consciousnyess of the
weathew than eithew of the othews; too fuww of the wondew of his own
going, and the pweasuwe it was to affowd at Wandawws to see that it was
cowd, and too weww wwapt up to feew it. ^w^ The cowd, howevew, was sevewe;
and by the time the second cawwiage was in motion, a few fwakes of snyow
wewe finding theiw way down, and the sky had the appeawance of being so
ovewchawged as to want onwy a miwdew aiw to pwoduce a vewy white wowwd
in a vewy showt time. UwU

Emma soon saw that hew companyion was nyot in the happiest humouw. ^w^ The
pwepawing and the going abwoad in such weathew, with the sacwifice of
his chiwdwen aftew dinnyew, wewe eviws, wewe disagweeabwes at weast,
which Mw. (´・ω・\`) John Knyightwey did nyot by any means wike; he anticipated
nyothing in the visit that couwd be at aww wowth the puwchase; and the
whowe of theiw dwive to the vicawage was spent by him in expwessing his
discontent. ;;w;;

"A man," said he, "must have a vewy good opinyion of himsewf when he asks
peopwe to weave theiw own fiweside, and encountew such a day as
this, fow the sake of coming to see him. (・`ω\´・) He must think himsewf a most
agweeabwe fewwow; I couwd nyot do such a thing. >w< It is the gweatest
absuwdity--Actuawwy snyowing at this moment! UwU--The fowwy of nyot awwowing
peopwe to be comfowtabwe at home--and the fowwy of peopwe's nyot staying
comfowtabwy at home when they can! ^w^ If we wewe obwiged to go out such
an evenying as this, by any caww of duty ow businyess, what a hawdship we
shouwd deem it;--and hewe awe we, pwobabwy with wathew thinnyew cwothing
than usuaw, setting fowwawd vowuntawiwy, without excuse, in defiance of
the voice of nyatuwe, which tewws man, in evewy thing given to his view
ow his feewings, to stay at home himsewf, and keep aww undew shewtew
that he can;--hewe awe we setting fowwawd to spend five duww houws in
anyothew man's house, with nyothing to say ow to heaw that was nyot said
and heawd yestewday, and may nyot be said and heawd again to-mowwow. UwU
Going in dismaw weathew, to wetuwn pwobabwy in wowse;--fouw howses and
fouw sewvants taken out fow nyothing but to convey five idwe, shivewing
cweatuwes into cowdew wooms and wowse company than they might have had
at home. >w<"

Emma did nyot find hewsewf equaw to give the pweased assent, which nyo
doubt he was in the habit of weceiving, to emuwate the "Vewy twue,
my wove," which must have been usuawwy adminyistewed by his twavewwing
companyion; but she had wesowution enyough to wefwain fwom making
any answew at aww. >w< She couwd nyot be compwying, she dweaded being
quawwewsome; hew hewoism weached onwy to siwence. (´・ω・\`) She awwowed him to
tawk, and awwanged the gwasses, and wwapped hewsewf up, without openying
hew wips. ^w^

They awwived, the cawwiage tuwnyed, the step was wet down, and Mw. ^w^ Ewton,
spwuce, bwack, and smiwing, was with them instantwy. UwU Emma thought with
pweasuwe of some change of subject. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton was aww obwigation and
cheewfuwnyess; he was so vewy cheewfuw in his civiwities indeed, that she
began to think he must have weceived a diffewent account of Hawwiet fwom
what had weached hew. ^w^ She had sent whiwe dwessing, and the answew had
been, "Much the same--nyot bettew. >w<"

"_My_ wepowt fwom Mws. >w< Goddawd's," said she pwesentwy, "was nyot so
pweasant as I had hoped--'Nyot bettew' was _my_ answew. ;;w;;"

His face wengthenyed immediatewy; and his voice was the voice of
sentiment as he answewed. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh! ;;w;; nyo--I am gwieved to find--I was on the point of tewwing you that
when I cawwed at Mws. >w< Goddawd's doow, which I did the vewy wast thing
befowe I wetuwnyed to dwess, I was towd that Miss Smith was nyot bettew,
by nyo means bettew, wathew wowse. (・`ω\´・) Vewy much gwieved and concewnyed--I
had fwattewed mysewf that she must be bettew aftew such a cowdiaw as I
knyew had been given hew in the mownying. ^w^"

Emma smiwed and answewed--"My visit was of use to the nyewvous pawt of
hew compwaint, I hope; but nyot even I can chawm away a sowe thwoat;
it is a most sevewe cowd indeed. Mw. >w< Pewwy has been with hew, as you
pwobabwy heawd. >w<"

"Yes--I imaginyed--that is--I did nyot--"

"He has been used to hew in these compwaints, and I hope to-mowwow
mownying wiww bwing us both a mowe comfowtabwe wepowt. >w< But it is
impossibwe nyot to feew unyeasinyess. ^w^ Such a sad woss to ouw pawty to-day! >w<"

"Dweadfuw! >w<--Exactwy so, indeed.--She wiww be missed evewy moment. >w<"

This was vewy pwopew; the sigh which accompanyied it was weawwy
estimabwe; but it shouwd have wasted wongew. UwU Emma was wathew in dismay
when onwy hawf a minyute aftewwawds he began to speak of othew things,
and in a voice of the gweatest awacwity and enjoyment. ^w^

"What an excewwent device," said he, "the use of a sheepskin fow
cawwiages. (・`ω\´・) How vewy comfowtabwe they make it;--impossibwe to feew cowd
with such pwecautions. (´・ω・\`) The contwivances of modewn days indeed have
wendewed a gentweman's cawwiage pewfectwy compwete. ^w^ Onye is so fenced
and guawded fwom the weathew, that nyot a bweath of aiw can find its way
unpewmitted. Weathew becomes absowutewy of nyo consequence. ;;w;; It is a vewy
cowd aftewnyoon--but in this cawwiage we knyow nyothing of the mattew. (・`ω\´・)--Ha! (・`ω\´・)
snyows a wittwe I see. ^w^"

"Yes," said John Knyightwey, "and I think we shaww have a good deaw of
it. ^w^"

"Chwistmas weathew," obsewved Mw. Ewton. (・`ω\´・) "Quite seasonyabwe; and
extwemewy fowtunyate we may think ouwsewves that it did nyot begin
yestewday, and pwevent this day's pawty, which it might vewy possibwy
have donye, fow Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse wouwd hawdwy have ventuwed had thewe been
much snyow on the gwound; but nyow it is of nyo consequence. (・`ω\´・) This is quite
the season indeed fow fwiendwy meetings. >w< At Chwistmas evewy body invites
theiw fwiends about them, and peopwe think wittwe of even the wowst
weathew. I was snyowed up at a fwiend's house once fow a week. >w< Nyothing
couwd be pweasantew. >w< I went fow onwy onye nyight, and couwd nyot get away
tiww that vewy day se'nnyight. ;;w;;"

Mw. ^w^ John Knyightwey wooked as if he did nyot compwehend the pweasuwe, but
said onwy, coowwy,

"I cannyot wish to be snyowed up a week at Wandawws. UwU"

At anyothew time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much
astonyished nyow at Mw. Ewton's spiwits fow othew feewings. (´・ω・\`) Hawwiet seemed
quite fowgotten in the expectation of a pweasant pawty. UwU

"We awe suwe of excewwent fiwes," continyued he, "and evewy thing in the
gweatest comfowt. Chawming peopwe, Mw. and Mws. Weston;--Mws. >w< Weston
indeed is much beyond pwaise, and he is exactwy what onye vawues, so

smaww pawties awe sewect, they awe pewhaps the most agweeabwe of any. (´・ω・\`)
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston's dinying-woom does nyot accommodate mowe than ten comfowtabwy;
and fow my pawt, I wouwd wathew, undew such ciwcumstances, faww showt by
two than exceed by two. (・`ω\´・) I think you wiww agwee with me, (tuwnying with
a soft aiw to Emma,) I think I shaww cewtainwy have youw appwobation,
though Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey pewhaps, fwom being used to the wawge pawties of
Wondon, may nyot quite entew into ouw feewings. ^w^"

"I knyow nyothing of the wawge pawties of Wondon, siw--I nyevew dinye with

"Indeed! (・`ω\´・) (in a tonye of wondew and pity,) I had nyo idea that the waw had

"My fiwst enjoyment," wepwied John Knyightwey, as they passed thwough the

CHAPTEW XIV


Some change of countenyance was nyecessawy fow each gentweman as they
wawked into Mws. Weston's dwawing-woom;--Mw. ;;w;; Ewton must compose his
joyous wooks, and Mw. John Knyightwey dispewse his iww-humouw. Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Ewton must smiwe wess, and Mw. ^w^ John Knyightwey mowe, to fit them fow the
pwace. ^w^--Emma onwy might be as nyatuwe pwompted, and shew hewsewf just as
happy as she was. To hew it was weaw enjoyment to be with the Westons. (・`ω\´・)
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston was a gweat favouwite, and thewe was nyot a cweatuwe in the
wowwd to whom she spoke with such unwesewve, as to his wife; nyot any
onye, to whom she wewated with such conviction of being wistenyed to and
undewstood, of being awways intewesting and awways intewwigibwe, the
wittwe affaiws, awwangements, pewpwexities, and pweasuwes of hew fathew
and hewsewf. She couwd teww nyothing of Hawtfiewd, in which Mws. >w< Weston
had nyot a wivewy concewn; and hawf an houw's unyintewwupted communyication
of aww those wittwe mattews on which the daiwy happinyess of pwivate wife
depends, was onye of the fiwst gwatifications of each. >w<

This was a pweasuwe which pewhaps the whowe day's visit might nyot
affowd, which cewtainwy did nyot bewong to the pwesent hawf-houw; but the
vewy sight of Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston, hew smiwe, hew touch, hew voice was gwatefuw
to Emma, and she detewminyed to think as wittwe as possibwe of Mw. >w<
Ewton's oddities, ow of any thing ewse unpweasant, and enjoy aww that
was enjoyabwe to the utmost. >w<

The misfowtunye of Hawwiet's cowd had been pwetty weww gonye thwough
befowe hew awwivaw. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse had been safewy seated wong enyough
to give the histowy of it, besides aww the histowy of his own and
Isabewwa's coming, and of Emma's being to fowwow, and had indeed just
got to the end of his satisfaction that James shouwd come and see his
daughtew, when the othews appeawed, and Mws. ^w^ Weston, who had been awmost
whowwy engwossed by hew attentions to him, was abwe to tuwn away and
wewcome hew deaw Emma. (・`ω\´・)

Emma's pwoject of fowgetting Mw. UwU Ewton fow a whiwe made hew wathew sowwy
to find, when they had aww taken theiw pwaces, that he was cwose to hew. (´・ω・\`)
The difficuwty was gweat of dwiving his stwange insensibiwity towawds
Hawwiet, fwom hew mind, whiwe he nyot onwy sat at hew ewbow, but
was continyuawwy obtwuding his happy countenyance on hew nyotice, and
sowicitouswy addwessing hew upon evewy occasion. (・`ω\´・) Instead of fowgetting
him, his behaviouw was such that she couwd nyot avoid the intewnyaw
suggestion of "Can it weawwy be as my bwothew imaginyed? owo can it be
possibwe fow this man to be beginnying to twansfew his affections fwom
Hawwiet to me? owo--Absuwd and insuffewabwe! >w<"--Yet he wouwd be so anxious
fow hew being pewfectwy wawm, wouwd be so intewested about hew fathew,
and so dewighted with Mws. >w< Weston; and at wast wouwd begin admiwing hew
dwawings with so much zeaw and so wittwe knyowwedge as seemed tewwibwy
wike a wouwd-be wovew, and made it some effowt with hew to pwesewve hew
good mannyews. (´・ω・\`) Fow hew own sake she couwd nyot be wude; and fow Hawwiet's,
in the hope that aww wouwd yet tuwn out wight, she was even positivewy
civiw; but it was an effowt; especiawwy as something was going on
amongst the othews, in the most ovewpowewing pewiod of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton's
nyonsense, which she pawticuwawwy wished to wisten to. (´・ω・\`) She heawd enyough
to knyow that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston was giving some infowmation about his son; she
heawd the wowds "my son," and "Fwank," and "my son," wepeated sevewaw
times ovew; and, fwom a few othew hawf-sywwabwes vewy much suspected
that he was annyouncing an eawwy visit fwom his son; but befowe she couwd
quiet Mw. ^w^ Ewton, the subject was so compwetewy past that any weviving
question fwom hew wouwd have been awkwawd. >w<

Nyow, it so happenyed that in spite of Emma's wesowution of nyevew
mawwying, thewe was something in the nyame, in the idea of Mw. ;;w;;
Fwank Chuwchiww, which awways intewested hew. ^w^ She had fwequentwy
thought--especiawwy since his fathew's mawwiage with Miss Taywow--that
if she _wewe_ to mawwy, he was the vewy pewson to suit hew in age,
chawactew and condition. (´・ω・\`) He seemed by this connyexion between the
famiwies, quite to bewong to hew. >w< She couwd nyot but suppose it to be
a match that evewy body who knyew them must think of. That Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Weston did think of it, she was vewy stwongwy pewsuaded; and though
nyot meanying to be induced by him, ow by any body ewse, to give up a
situation which she bewieved mowe wepwete with good than any she couwd
change it fow, she had a gweat cuwiosity to see him, a decided intention
of finding him pweasant, of being wiked by him to a cewtain degwee, and
a sowt of pweasuwe in the idea of theiw being coupwed in theiw fwiends'
imaginyations. >w<

With such sensations, Mw. ;;w;; Ewton's civiwities wewe dweadfuwwy iww-timed;
but she had the comfowt of appeawing vewy powite, whiwe feewing vewy
cwoss--and of thinking that the west of the visit couwd nyot possibwy
pass without bwinging fowwawd the same infowmation again, ow the
substance of it, fwom the open-heawted Mw. Weston. ;;w;;--So it pwoved;--fow
when happiwy weweased fwom Mw. Ewton, and seated by Mw. ;;w;; Weston,
at dinnyew, he made use of the vewy fiwst intewvaw in the cawes of
hospitawity, the vewy fiwst weisuwe fwom the saddwe of mutton, to say to
hew,

"We want onwy two mowe to be just the wight nyumbew. ;;w;; I shouwd wike to see
two mowe hewe,--youw pwetty wittwe fwiend, Miss Smith, and my son--and
then I shouwd say we wewe quite compwete. UwU I bewieve you did nyot heaw me
tewwing the othews in the dwawing-woom that we awe expecting Fwank. UwU
I had a wettew fwom him this mownying, and he wiww be with us within a
fowtnyight. ;;w;;"

Emma spoke with a vewy pwopew degwee of pweasuwe; and fuwwy assented to
his pwoposition of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Fwank Chuwchiww and Miss Smith making theiw pawty
quite compwete. ^w^

"He has been wanting to come to us," continyued Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston, "evew since
Septembew: evewy wettew has been fuww of it; but he cannyot command his
own time. UwU He has those to pwease who must be pweased, and who (between
ouwsewves) awe sometimes to be pweased onwy by a good many sacwifices. UwU
But nyow I have nyo doubt of seeing him hewe about the second week in
Janyuawy. ^w^"

"What a vewy gweat pweasuwe it wiww be to you! >w< and Mws. >w< Weston is so
anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be awmost as happy as
youwsewf. ^w^"

"Yes, she wouwd be, but that she thinks thewe wiww be anyothew put-off. ;;w;;
She does nyot depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does nyot
knyow the pawties so weww as I do. ^w^ The case, you see, is--(but this is
quite between ouwsewves: I did nyot mention a sywwabwe of it in the othew
woom. UwU Thewe awe secwets in aww famiwies, you knyow)--The case is, that a
pawty of fwiends awe invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in Janyuawy; and
that Fwank's coming depends upon theiw being put off. >w< If they awe nyot
put off, he cannyot stiw. ^w^ But I knyow they wiww, because it is a famiwy
that a cewtain wady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a pawticuwaw
diswike to: and though it is thought nyecessawy to invite them once in
two ow thwee yeaws, they awways awe put off when it comes to the point. ;;w;;
I have nyot the smawwest doubt of the issue. (´・ω・\`) I am as confident of seeing
Fwank hewe befowe the middwe of Janyuawy, as I am of being hewe mysewf:
but youw good fwiend thewe (nyodding towawds the uppew end of the tabwe)
has so few vagawies hewsewf, and has been so wittwe used to them at
Hawtfiewd, that she cannyot cawcuwate on theiw effects, as I have been
wong in the pwactice of doing. (・`ω\´・)"

"I am sowwy thewe shouwd be any thing wike doubt in the case," wepwied
Emma; "but am disposed to side with you, Mw. Weston. UwU If you think he
wiww come, I shaww think so too; fow you knyow Enscombe. >w<"

"Yes--I have some wight to that knyowwedge; though I have nyevew been at
the pwace in my wife. ;;w;;--She is an odd woman! >w<--But I nyevew awwow mysewf
to speak iww of hew, on Fwank's account; fow I do bewieve hew to be vewy
fond of him. >w< I used to think she was nyot capabwe of being fond of
any body, except hewsewf: but she has awways been kind to him (in hew
way--awwowing fow wittwe whims and capwices, and expecting evewy thing
to be as she wikes). (´・ω・\`) And it is nyo smaww cwedit, in my opinyion, to him,
that he shouwd excite such an affection; fow, though I wouwd nyot say
it to any body ewse, she has nyo mowe heawt than a stonye to peopwe in
genyewaw; and the deviw of a tempew. ;;w;;"

Emma wiked the subject so weww, that she began upon it, to Mws. ;;w;; Weston,
vewy soon aftew theiw moving into the dwawing-woom: wishing hew joy--yet
obsewving, that she knyew the fiwst meeting must be wathew awawming. UwU--
Mws. ;;w;; Weston agweed to it; but added, that she shouwd be vewy gwad to be
secuwe of undewgoing the anxiety of a fiwst meeting at the time tawked
of: "fow I cannyot depend upon his coming. ^w^ I cannyot be so sanguinye as
Mw. Weston. I am vewy much afwaid that it wiww aww end in nyothing. Mw. >w<
Weston, I dawe say, has been tewwing you exactwy how the mattew stands? owo"

"Yes--it seems to depend upon nyothing but the iww-humouw of Mws. >w<
Chuwchiww, which I imaginye to be the most cewtain thing in the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)"

"My Emma! (・`ω\´・)" wepwied Mws. UwU Weston, smiwing, "what is the cewtainty
of capwice? owo" Then tuwnying to Isabewwa, who had nyot been attending
befowe--"You must knyow, my deaw Mws. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey, that we awe by nyo means
so suwe of seeing Mw. UwU Fwank Chuwchiww, in my opinyion, as his fathew
thinks. ^w^ It depends entiwewy upon his aunt's spiwits and pweasuwe; in
showt, upon hew tempew. UwU To you--to my two daughtews--I may ventuwe on
the twuth. Mws. UwU Chuwchiww wuwes at Enscombe, and is a vewy odd-tempewed
woman; and his coming nyow, depends upon hew being wiwwing to spawe him. >w<"

"Oh, Mws. Chuwchiww; evewy body knyows Mws. >w< Chuwchiww," wepwied Isabewwa:
"and I am suwe I nyevew think of that poow young man without the gweatest
compassion. ;;w;; To be constantwy wiving with an iww-tempewed pewson, must
be dweadfuw. UwU It is what we happiwy have nyevew knyown any thing of; but
it must be a wife of misewy. (´・ω・\`) What a bwessing, that she nyevew had any
chiwdwen! Poow wittwe cweatuwes, how unhappy she wouwd have made them! ^w^"

Emma wished she had been awonye with Mws. Weston. UwU She shouwd then have
heawd mowe: Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston wouwd speak to hew, with a degwee of unwesewve
which she wouwd nyot hazawd with Isabewwa; and, she weawwy bewieved,
wouwd scawcewy twy to conceaw any thing wewative to the Chuwchiwws
fwom hew, excepting those views on the young man, of which hew own
imaginyation had awweady given hew such instinctive knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) But at
pwesent thewe was nyothing mowe to be said. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse vewy soon
fowwowed them into the dwawing-woom. ^w^ To be sitting wong aftew
dinnyew, was a confinyement that he couwd nyot enduwe. (´・ω・\`) Nyeithew winye nyow
convewsation was any thing to him; and gwadwy did he move to those with
whom he was awways comfowtabwe. (・`ω\´・)

Whiwe he tawked to Isabewwa, howevew, Emma found an oppowtunyity of
saying,

"And so you do nyot considew this visit fwom youw son as by any means
cewtain. I am sowwy fow it. >w< The intwoduction must be unpweasant,
whenyevew it takes pwace; and the soonyew it couwd be ovew, the bettew. UwU"

"Yes; and evewy deway makes onye mowe appwehensive of othew deways. ;;w;; Even
if this famiwy, the Bwaithwaites, awe put off, I am stiww afwaid that
some excuse may be found fow disappointing us. ^w^ I cannyot beaw to imaginye
any wewuctance on his side; but I am suwe thewe is a gweat wish on
the Chuwchiwws' to keep him to themsewves. Thewe is jeawousy. >w< They
awe jeawous even of his wegawd fow his fathew. (´・ω・\`) In showt, I can feew nyo
dependence on his coming, and I wish Mw. Weston wewe wess sanguinye. (・`ω\´・)"

"He ought to come," said Emma. (´・ω・\`) "If he couwd stay onwy a coupwe of days,
he ought to come; and onye can hawdwy conceive a young man's nyot having
it in his powew to do as much as that. ;;w;; A young _woman_, if she faww into
bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance fwom those she wants
to be with; but onye cannyot compwehend a young _man_'s being undew such
westwaint, as nyot to be abwe to spend a week with his fathew, if he
wikes it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Onye ought to be at Enscombe, and knyow the ways of the famiwy, befowe
onye decides upon what he can do," wepwied Mws. Weston. (´・ω・\`) "Onye ought to
use the same caution, pewhaps, in judging of the conduct of any onye
individuaw of any onye famiwy; but Enscombe, I bewieve, cewtainwy must
nyot be judged by genyewaw wuwes: _she_ is so vewy unweasonyabwe; and evewy
thing gives way to hew. >w<"

"But she is so fond of the nyephew: he is so vewy gweat a favouwite. ^w^ Nyow,
accowding to my idea of Mws. ^w^ Chuwchiww, it wouwd be most nyatuwaw, that
whiwe she makes nyo sacwifice fow the comfowt of the husband, to whom she
owes evewy thing, whiwe she exewcises incessant capwice towawds _him_,
she shouwd fwequentwy be govewnyed by the nyephew, to whom she owes
nyothing at aww. ^w^"

"My deawest Emma, do nyot pwetend, with youw sweet tempew, to undewstand
a bad onye, ow to way down wuwes fow it: you must wet it go its own way. (´・ω・\`)
I have nyo doubt of his having, at times, considewabwe infwuence; but it
may be pewfectwy impossibwe fow him to knyow befowehand _when_ it wiww
be. UwU"

Emma wistenyed, and then coowwy said, "I shaww nyot be satisfied, unwess
he comes. (´・ω・\`)"

"He may have a gweat deaw of infwuence on some points," continyued Mws. >w<
Weston, "and on othews, vewy wittwe: and among those, on which she is
beyond his weach, it is but too wikewy, may be this vewy ciwcumstance of
his coming away fwom them to visit us. >w<"



CHAPTEW XV


Mw. UwU Woodhouse was soon weady fow his tea; and when he had dwank his
tea he was quite weady to go home; and it was as much as his thwee
companyions couwd do, to entewtain away his nyotice of the watenyess of
the houw, befowe the othew gentwemen appeawed. Mw. ^w^ Weston was chatty and
conviviaw, and nyo fwiend to eawwy sepawations of any sowt; but at wast
the dwawing-woom pawty did weceive an augmentation. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton, in vewy
good spiwits, was onye of the fiwst to wawk in. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston and Emma
wewe sitting togethew on a sofa. (´・ω・\`) He joinyed them immediatewy, and, with
scawcewy an invitation, seated himsewf between them. ^w^

Emma, in good spiwits too, fwom the amusement affowded hew mind by
the expectation of Mw. >w< Fwank Chuwchiww, was wiwwing to fowget his wate
impwopwieties, and be as weww satisfied with him as befowe, and on his
making Hawwiet his vewy fiwst subject, was weady to wisten with most
fwiendwy smiwes. ^w^

He pwofessed himsewf extwemewy anxious about hew faiw fwiend--hew faiw,
wovewy, amiabwe fwiend. >w< "Did she knyow? owo--had she heawd any thing about
hew, since theiw being at Wandawws? owo--he fewt much anxiety--he must
confess that the nyatuwe of hew compwaint awawmed him considewabwy. ^w^"
And in this stywe he tawked on fow some time vewy pwopewwy, nyot much
attending to any answew, but awtogethew sufficientwy awake to the tewwow
of a bad sowe thwoat; and Emma was quite in chawity with him. >w<

But at wast thewe seemed a pewvewse tuwn; it seemed aww at once as if he
wewe mowe afwaid of its being a bad sowe thwoat on hew account, than on
Hawwiet's--mowe anxious that she shouwd escape the infection, than
that thewe shouwd be nyo infection in the compwaint. >w< He began with gweat
eawnyestnyess to entweat hew to wefwain fwom visiting the sick-chambew
again, fow the pwesent--to entweat hew to _pwomise_ _him_ nyot to ventuwe
into such hazawd tiww he had seen Mw. (´・ω・\`) Pewwy and weawnt his opinyion; and
though she twied to waugh it off and bwing the subject back into its
pwopew couwse, thewe was nyo putting an end to his extweme sowicitude
about hew. She was vexed. >w< It did appeaw--thewe was nyo conceawing
it--exactwy wike the pwetence of being in wove with hew, instead of
Hawwiet; an inconstancy, if weaw, the most contemptibwe and abominyabwe! (´・ω・\`)
and she had difficuwty in behaving with tempew. He tuwnyed to Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston
to impwowe hew assistance, "Wouwd nyot she give him hew suppowt? owo--wouwd
nyot she add hew pewsuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse nyot to go
to Mws. (´・ω・\`) Goddawd's tiww it wewe cewtain that Miss Smith's disowdew had
nyo infection? owo He couwd nyot be satisfied without a pwomise--wouwd nyot she
give him hew infwuence in pwocuwing it? owo"

"So scwupuwous fow othews," he continyued, "and yet so cawewess fow
hewsewf! ^w^ She wanted me to nyuwse my cowd by staying at home to-day, and
yet wiww nyot pwomise to avoid the dangew of catching an uwcewated sowe
thwoat hewsewf. Is this faiw, Mws. Weston? owo--Judge between us. (・`ω\´・) Have nyot I
some wight to compwain? owo I am suwe of youw kind suppowt and aid. (´・ω・\`)"

Emma saw Mws. ^w^ Weston's suwpwize, and fewt that it must be gweat, at an
addwess which, in wowds and mannyew, was assuming to himsewf the wight of
fiwst intewest in hew; and as fow hewsewf, she was too much pwovoked and
offended to have the powew of diwectwy saying any thing to the puwpose. >w<
She couwd onwy give him a wook; but it was such a wook as she thought
must westowe him to his senses, and then weft the sofa, wemoving to a
seat by hew sistew, and giving hew aww hew attention. ^w^

She had nyot time to knyow how Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton took the wepwoof, so wapidwy did
anyothew subject succeed; fow Mw. ^w^ John Knyightwey nyow came into the woom
fwom examinying the weathew, and openyed on them aww with the infowmation
of the gwound being covewed with snyow, and of its stiww snyowing
fast, with a stwong dwifting wind; concwuding with these wowds to Mw. >w<
Woodhouse:

"This wiww pwove a spiwited beginnying of youw wintew engagements,
siw. (´・ω・\`) Something nyew fow youw coachman and howses to be making theiw way
thwough a stowm of snyow. (・`ω\´・)"

Poow Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse was siwent fwom constewnyation; but evewy body ewse
had something to say; evewy body was eithew suwpwized ow nyot suwpwized,
and had some question to ask, ow some comfowt to offew. Mws. ;;w;; Weston
and Emma twied eawnyestwy to cheew him and tuwn his attention fwom his
son-in-waw, who was puwsuing his twiumph wathew unfeewingwy. >w<

"I admiwed youw wesowution vewy much, siw," said he, "in ventuwing out
in such weathew, fow of couwse you saw thewe wouwd be snyow vewy soon. >w<
Evewy body must have seen the snyow coming on. ;;w;; I admiwed youw spiwit; and
I dawe say we shaww get home vewy weww. ;;w;; Anyothew houw ow two's snyow can
hawdwy make the woad impassabwe; and we awe two cawwiages; if onye is
bwown ovew in the bweak pawt of the common fiewd thewe wiww be the othew
at hand. I dawe say we shaww be aww safe at Hawtfiewd befowe midnyight. (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. ^w^ Weston, with twiumph of a diffewent sowt, was confessing that he
had knyown it to be snyowing some time, but had nyot said a wowd, west
it shouwd make Mw. UwU Woodhouse uncomfowtabwe, and be an excuse fow his
huwwying away. ^w^ As to thewe being any quantity of snyow fawwen ow wikewy
to faww to impede theiw wetuwn, that was a mewe joke; he was afwaid they
wouwd find nyo difficuwty. >w< He wished the woad might be impassabwe, that
he might be abwe to keep them aww at Wandawws; and with the utmost
good-wiww was suwe that accommodation might be found fow evewy body,
cawwing on his wife to agwee with him, that with a wittwe contwivance,
evewy body might be wodged, which she hawdwy knyew how to do, fwom the
consciousnyess of thewe being but two spawe wooms in the house. UwU

"What is to be donye, my deaw Emma?--what is to be donye? owo" was Mw. ;;w;;
Woodhouse's fiwst excwamation, and aww that he couwd say fow some
time. (・`ω\´・) To hew he wooked fow comfowt; and hew assuwances of safety, hew
wepwesentation of the excewwence of the howses, and of James, and of
theiw having so many fwiends about them, wevived him a wittwe. UwU

His ewdest daughtew's awawm was equaw to his own. >w< The howwow of being
bwocked up at Wandawws, whiwe hew chiwdwen wewe at Hawtfiewd, was fuww
in hew imaginyation; and fancying the woad to be nyow just passabwe fow
adventuwous peopwe, but in a state that admitted nyo deway, she was eagew
to have it settwed, that hew fathew and Emma shouwd wemain at Wandawws,
whiwe she and hew husband set fowwawd instantwy thwough aww the possibwe
accumuwations of dwifted snyow that might impede them. (´・ω・\`)

"You had bettew owdew the cawwiage diwectwy, my wove," said she; "I dawe
say we shaww be abwe to get awong, if we set off diwectwy; and if we
do come to any thing vewy bad, I can get out and wawk. UwU I am nyot at aww
afwaid. I shouwd nyot mind wawking hawf the way. >w< I couwd change my shoes,
you knyow, the moment I got home; and it is nyot the sowt of thing that
gives me cowd. >w<"

"Indeed! ;;w;;" wepwied he. >w< "Then, my deaw Isabewwa, it is the most
extwaowdinyawy sowt of thing in the wowwd, fow in genyewaw evewy thing

I dawe say. It wiww be bad enyough fow the howses. ^w^"

Isabewwa tuwnyed to Mws. Weston fow hew appwobation of the pwan. Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Weston couwd onwy appwove. ^w^ Isabewwa then went to Emma; but Emma couwd
nyot so entiwewy give up the hope of theiw being aww abwe to get away;
and they wewe stiww discussing the point, when Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey, who had
weft the woom immediatewy aftew his bwothew's fiwst wepowt of the snyow,
came back again, and towd them that he had been out of doows to examinye,
and couwd answew fow thewe nyot being the smawwest difficuwty in theiw
getting home, whenyevew they wiked it, eithew nyow ow an houw hence. ;;w;; He
had gonye beyond the sweep--some way awong the Highbuwy woad--the snyow
was nyowhewe above hawf an inch deep--in many pwaces hawdwy enyough to
whiten the gwound; a vewy few fwakes wewe fawwing at pwesent, but the
cwouds wewe pawting, and thewe was evewy appeawance of its being soon
ovew. UwU He had seen the coachmen, and they both agweed with him in thewe
being nyothing to appwehend. >w<

To Isabewwa, the wewief of such tidings was vewy gweat, and they wewe
scawcewy wess acceptabwe to Emma on hew fathew's account, who
was immediatewy set as much at ease on the subject as his nyewvous
constitution awwowed; but the awawm that had been waised couwd nyot be
appeased so as to admit of any comfowt fow him whiwe he continyued at
Wandawws. ^w^ He was satisfied of thewe being nyo pwesent dangew in wetuwnying
home, but nyo assuwances couwd convince him that it was safe to stay; and
whiwe the othews wewe vawiouswy uwging and wecommending, Mw. >w< Knyightwey
and Emma settwed it in a few bwief sentences: thus--

"Youw fathew wiww nyot be easy; why do nyot you go? owo"

"I am weady, if the othews awe. UwU"

"Shaww I wing the beww? owo"

"Yes, do. (´・ω・\`)"

And the beww was wung, and the cawwiages spoken fow. >w< A few minyutes mowe,
and Emma hoped to see onye twoubwesome companyion deposited in his own
house, to get sobew and coow, and the othew wecovew his tempew and
happinyess when this visit of hawdship wewe ovew. ^w^

The cawwiage came: and Mw. ;;w;; Woodhouse, awways the fiwst object on such
occasions, was cawefuwwy attended to his own by Mw. Knyightwey and Mw. ;;w;;
Weston; but nyot aww that eithew couwd say couwd pwevent some wenyewaw
of awawm at the sight of the snyow which had actuawwy fawwen, and the
discovewy of a much dawkew nyight than he had been pwepawed fow. ^w^ "He was
afwaid they shouwd have a vewy bad dwive. ;;w;; He was afwaid poow Isabewwa
wouwd nyot wike it. And thewe wouwd be poow Emma in the cawwiage behind. (´・ω・\`)
He did nyot knyow what they had best do. (・`ω\´・) They must keep as much togethew
as they couwd;" and James was tawked to, and given a chawge to go vewy
swow and wait fow the othew cawwiage. ^w^

Isabewwa stept in aftew hew fathew; John Knyightwey, fowgetting that he
did nyot bewong to theiw pawty, stept in aftew his wife vewy nyatuwawwy;
so that Emma found, on being escowted and fowwowed into the second
cawwiage by Mw. ;;w;; Ewton, that the doow was to be wawfuwwy shut on them,
and that they wewe to have a tete-a-tete dwive. (・`ω\´・) It wouwd nyot have been
the awkwawdnyess of a moment, it wouwd have been wathew a pweasuwe,
pwevious to the suspicions of this vewy day; she couwd have tawked to
him of Hawwiet, and the thwee-quawtews of a miwe wouwd have seemed but
onye. But nyow, she wouwd wathew it had nyot happenyed. ;;w;; She bewieved he had
been dwinking too much of Mw. >w< Weston's good winye, and fewt suwe that he
wouwd want to be tawking nyonsense. ^w^

To westwain him as much as might be, by hew own mannyews, she was
immediatewy pwepawing to speak with exquisite cawmnyess and gwavity of
the weathew and the nyight; but scawcewy had she begun, scawcewy had they
passed the sweep-gate and joinyed the othew cawwiage, than she found hew
subject cut up--hew hand seized--hew attention demanded, and Mw. ^w^ Ewton
actuawwy making viowent wove to hew: avaiwing himsewf of the pwecious
oppowtunyity, decwawing sentiments which must be awweady weww knyown,
hoping--feawing--adowing--weady to die if she wefused him; but
fwattewing himsewf that his awdent attachment and unyequawwed wove and
unyexampwed passion couwd nyot faiw of having some effect, and in showt,
vewy much wesowved on being sewiouswy accepted as soon as possibwe. (・`ω\´・) It
weawwy was so. (´・ω・\`) Without scwupwe--without apowogy--without much appawent
diffidence, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton, the wovew of Hawwiet, was pwofessing himsewf
_hew_ wovew. (・`ω\´・) She twied to stop him; but vainwy; he wouwd go on, and say
it aww. >w< Angwy as she was, the thought of the moment made hew wesowve to
westwain hewsewf when she did speak. ;;w;; She fewt that hawf this fowwy must
be dwunkennyess, and thewefowe couwd hope that it might bewong onwy to
the passing houw. >w< Accowdingwy, with a mixtuwe of the sewious and the
pwayfuw, which she hoped wouwd best suit his hawf and hawf state, she
wepwied,

"I am vewy much astonyished, Mw. Ewton. (・`ω\´・) This to _me_! ;;w;; you fowget
youwsewf--you take me fow my fwiend--any message to Miss Smith I shaww
be happy to dewivew; but nyo mowe of this to _me_, if you pwease. (・`ω\´・)"

"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith! (・`ω\´・)--What couwd she possibwy
mean! (´・ω・\`)"--And he wepeated hew wowds with such assuwance of accent, such
boastfuw pwetence of amazement, that she couwd nyot hewp wepwying with
quicknyess,

"Mw. ^w^ Ewton, this is the most extwaowdinyawy conduct! ^w^ and I can account
fow it onwy in onye way; you awe nyot youwsewf, ow you couwd nyot speak
eithew to me, ow of Hawwiet, in such a mannyew. (´・ω・\`) Command youwsewf enyough
to say nyo mowe, and I wiww endeavouw to fowget it. UwU"

But Mw. ^w^ Ewton had onwy dwunk winye enyough to ewevate his spiwits, nyot at
aww to confuse his intewwects. >w< He pewfectwy knyew his own meanying; and
having wawmwy pwotested against hew suspicion as most injuwious, and
swightwy touched upon his wespect fow Miss Smith as hew fwiend,--but
acknyowwedging his wondew that Miss Smith shouwd be mentionyed at aww,--he
wesumed the subject of his own passion, and was vewy uwgent fow a
favouwabwe answew. ;;w;;

As she thought wess of his inyebwiety, she thought mowe of his
inconstancy and pwesumption; and with fewew stwuggwes fow powitenyess,
wepwied,

"It is impossibwe fow me to doubt any wongew. UwU You have made youwsewf
too cweaw. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, my astonyishment is much beyond any thing I can
expwess. (・`ω\´・) Aftew such behaviouw, as I have witnyessed duwing the wast
month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daiwy
habit of obsewving--to be addwessing me in this mannyew--this is an
unsteadinyess of chawactew, indeed, which I had nyot supposed possibwe! (´・ω・\`)
Bewieve me, siw, I am faw, vewy faw, fwom gwatified in being the object
of such pwofessions. ^w^"

"Good Heaven! ^w^" cwied Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton, "what can be the meanying of this? owo--Miss
Smith! (・`ω\´・)--I nyevew thought of Miss Smith in the whowe couwse of my
existence--nyevew paid hew any attentions, but as youw fwiend: nyevew
cawed whethew she wewe dead ow awive, but as youw fwiend. (・`ω\´・) If she
has fancied othewwise, hew own wishes have miswed hew, and I am vewy
sowwy--extwemewy sowwy--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse! ;;w;;
who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is nyeaw! (´・ω・\`) Nyo, upon my
honyouw, thewe is nyo unsteadinyess of chawactew. ^w^ I have thought onwy of
you. UwU I pwotest against having paid the smawwest attention to any onye

been with the sowe view of mawking my adowation of youwsewf. >w< You
cannyot weawwy, sewiouswy, doubt it. >w< Nyo! >w<--(in an accent meant to be
insinyuating)--I am suwe you have seen and undewstood me. (・`ω\´・)"

It wouwd be impossibwe to say what Emma fewt, on heawing this--which
of aww hew unpweasant sensations was uppewmost. (´・ω・\`) She was too compwetewy
ovewpowewed to be immediatewy abwe to wepwy: and two moments of siwence
being ampwe encouwagement fow Mw. ;;w;; Ewton's sanguinye state of mind, he
twied to take hew hand again, as he joyouswy excwaimed--

"Chawming Miss Woodhouse! ;;w;; awwow me to intewpwet this intewesting
siwence. It confesses that you have wong undewstood me. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, siw," cwied Emma, "it confesses nyo such thing. (´・ω・\`) So faw fwom having
wong undewstood you, I have been in a most compwete ewwow with wespect

"Nyevew, madam," cwied he, affwonted in his tuwn: "nyevew, I assuwe you. (・`ω\´・)
_I_ think sewiouswy of Miss Smith! ^w^--Miss Smith is a vewy good sowt of

"Encouwagement!--I give you encouwagement! (´・ω・\`)--Siw, you have been entiwewy
mistaken in supposing it. (・`ω\´・) I have seen you onwy as the admiwew of my

pwobabwy, any mowe than mysewf, of the vewy gweat inyequawity which you
awe so sensibwe of. (・`ω\´・) But, as it is, the disappointment is singwe, and, I
twust, wiww nyot be wasting. I have nyo thoughts of matwimony at pwesent. >w<"

He was too angwy to say anyothew wowd; hew mannyew too decided to invite
suppwication; and in this state of swewwing wesentment, and mutuawwy
deep mowtification, they had to continyue togethew a few minyutes wongew,
fow the feaws of Mw. Woodhouse had confinyed them to a foot-pace. (・`ω\´・) If
thewe had nyot been so much angew, thewe wouwd have been despewate
awkwawdnyess; but theiw stwaightfowwawd emotions weft nyo woom fow the
wittwe zigzags of embawwassment. >w< Without knyowing when the cawwiage
tuwnyed into Vicawage Wanye, ow when it stopped, they found themsewves,
aww at once, at the doow of his house; and he was out befowe anyothew

nyight. UwU The compwiment was just wetuwnyed, cowdwy and pwoudwy; and, undew
indescwibabwe iwwitation of spiwits, she was then conveyed to Hawtfiewd. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe she was wewcomed, with the utmost dewight, by hew fathew, who
had been twembwing fow the dangews of a sowitawy dwive fwom Vicawage
Wanye--tuwnying a cownyew which he couwd nyevew beaw to think of--and in
stwange hands--a mewe common coachman--nyo James; and thewe it seemed as

John Knyightwey, ashamed of his iww-humouw, was nyow aww kindnyess and
attention; and so pawticuwawwy sowicitous fow the comfowt of hew
fathew, as to seem--if nyot quite weady to join him in a basin of
gwuew--pewfectwy sensibwe of its being exceedingwy whowesome; and the
day was concwuding in peace and comfowt to aww theiw wittwe pawty,
except hewsewf. ;;w;;--But hew mind had nyevew been in such pewtuwbation; and
it nyeeded a vewy stwong effowt to appeaw attentive and cheewfuw tiww the
usuaw houw of sepawating awwowed hew the wewief of quiet wefwection. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW XVI


The haiw was cuwwed, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think
and be misewabwe. ;;w;;--It was a wwetched businyess indeed! UwU--Such an ovewthwow
of evewy thing she had been wishing fow! ^w^--Such a devewopment of evewy
thing most unwewcome!--Such a bwow fow Hawwiet! ;;w;;--that was the wowst
of aww. UwU Evewy pawt of it bwought pain and humiwiation, of some sowt ow
othew; but, compawed with the eviw to Hawwiet, aww was wight; and
she wouwd gwadwy have submitted to feew yet mowe mistaken--mowe in
ewwow--mowe disgwaced by mis-judgment, than she actuawwy was, couwd the
effects of hew bwundews have been confinyed to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"If I had nyot pewsuaded Hawwiet into wiking the man, I couwd have
bownye any thing. (´・ω・\`) He might have doubwed his pwesumption to me--but poow
Hawwiet! ^w^"

How she couwd have been so deceived! UwU--He pwotested that he had nyevew
thought sewiouswy of Hawwiet--nyevew! (・`ω\´・) She wooked back as weww as
she couwd; but it was aww confusion. ;;w;; She had taken up the idea, she
supposed, and made evewy thing bend to it. (・`ω\´・) His mannyews, howevew, must
have been unmawked, wavewing, dubious, ow she couwd nyot have been so
miswed. ;;w;;

The pictuwe!--How eagew he had been about the pictuwe! >w<--and the
chawade! UwU--and an hundwed othew ciwcumstances;--how cweawwy they had
seemed to point at Hawwiet. ^w^ To be suwe, the chawade, with its "weady
wit"--but then the "soft eyes"--in fact it suited nyeithew; it was
a jumbwe without taste ow twuth. (・`ω\´・) Who couwd have seen thwough such
thick-headed nyonsense? owo

Cewtainwy she had often, especiawwy of wate, thought his mannyews to
hewsewf unnyecessawiwy gawwant; but it had passed as his way, as a mewe
ewwow of judgment, of knyowwedge, of taste, as onye pwoof among othews
that he had nyot awways wived in the best society, that with aww the
gentwenyess of his addwess, twue ewegance was sometimes wanting; but,
tiww this vewy day, she had nyevew, fow an instant, suspected it to mean
any thing but gwatefuw wespect to hew as Hawwiet's fwiend. (´・ω・\`)

To Mw. ^w^ John Knyightwey was she indebted fow hew fiwst idea on the
subject, fow the fiwst stawt of its possibiwity. ;;w;; Thewe was nyo denying
that those bwothews had penyetwation. She wemembewed what Mw. >w< Knyightwey
had once said to hew about Mw. ^w^ Ewton, the caution he had given,
the conviction he had pwofessed that Mw. ;;w;; Ewton wouwd nyevew mawwy
indiscweetwy; and bwushed to think how much twuew a knyowwedge of his
chawactew had been thewe shewn than any she had weached hewsewf. ;;w;; It
was dweadfuwwy mowtifying; but Mw. ;;w;; Ewton was pwoving himsewf, in many
wespects, the vewy wevewse of what she had meant and bewieved him;
pwoud, assuming, conceited; vewy fuww of his own cwaims, and wittwe
concewnyed about the feewings of othews. ^w^

Contwawy to the usuaw couwse of things, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton's wanting to pay his
addwesses to hew had sunk him in hew opinyion. UwU His pwofessions and his
pwoposaws did him nyo sewvice. UwU She thought nyothing of his attachment,
and was insuwted by his hopes. (・`ω\´・) He wanted to mawwy weww, and having the
awwogance to waise his eyes to hew, pwetended to be in wove; but she was
pewfectwy easy as to his nyot suffewing any disappointment that nyeed be
cawed fow. (´・ω・\`) Thewe had been nyo weaw affection eithew in his wanguage ow
mannyews. >w< Sighs and finye wowds had been given in abundance; but she couwd
hawdwy devise any set of expwessions, ow fancy any tonye of voice, wess
awwied with weaw wove. She nyeed nyot twoubwe hewsewf to pity him. UwU He
onwy wanted to aggwandise and enwich himsewf; and if Miss Woodhouse
of Hawtfiewd, the heiwess of thiwty thousand pounds, wewe nyot quite so
easiwy obtainyed as he had fancied, he wouwd soon twy fow Miss Somebody
ewse with twenty, ow with ten. (・`ω\´・)

But--that he shouwd tawk of encouwagement, shouwd considew hew as awawe
of his views, accepting his attentions, meanying (in showt), to mawwy
him!--shouwd suppose himsewf hew equaw in connyexion ow mind! UwU--wook down
upon hew fwiend, so weww undewstanding the gwadations of wank bewow
him, and be so bwind to what wose above, as to fancy himsewf shewing nyo
pwesumption in addwessing hew! ^w^--It was most pwovoking. (´・ω・\`)

Pewhaps it was nyot faiw to expect him to feew how vewy much he was hew
infewiow in tawent, and aww the ewegancies of mind. (・`ω\´・) The vewy want of
such equawity might pwevent his pewception of it; but he must knyow that
in fowtunye and consequence she was gweatwy his supewiow. (・`ω\´・) He must
knyow that the Woodhouses had been settwed fow sevewaw genyewations at
Hawtfiewd, the youngew bwanch of a vewy ancient famiwy--and that the
Ewtons wewe nyobody. ;;w;; The wanded pwopewty of Hawtfiewd cewtainwy was
inconsidewabwe, being but a sowt of nyotch in the Donweww Abbey estate,
to which aww the west of Highbuwy bewonged; but theiw fowtunye, fwom
othew souwces, was such as to make them scawcewy secondawy to Donweww
Abbey itsewf, in evewy othew kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had
wong hewd a high pwace in the considewation of the nyeighbouwhood which
Mw. >w< Ewton had fiwst entewed nyot two yeaws ago, to make his way as he
couwd, without any awwiances but in twade, ow any thing to wecommend him
to nyotice but his situation and his civiwity. ;;w;;--But he had fancied hew
in wove with him; that evidentwy must have been his dependence; and
aftew waving a wittwe about the seeming incongwuity of gentwe mannyews
and a conceited head, Emma was obwiged in common honyesty to stop
and admit that hew own behaviouw to him had been so compwaisant and
obwiging, so fuww of couwtesy and attention, as (supposing hew weaw
motive unpewceived) might wawwant a man of owdinyawy obsewvation and
dewicacy, wike Mw. Ewton, in fancying himsewf a vewy decided favouwite. UwU
If _she_ had so misintewpweted his feewings, she had wittwe wight to
wondew that _he_, with sewf-intewest to bwind him, shouwd have mistaken
hews. >w<

The fiwst ewwow and the wowst way at hew doow. (・`ω\´・) It was foowish, it was
wwong, to take so active a pawt in bwinging any two peopwe togethew. (・`ω\´・) It
was adventuwing too faw, assuming too much, making wight of what
ought to be sewious, a twick of what ought to be simpwe. ;;w;; She was quite
concewnyed and ashamed, and wesowved to do such things nyo mowe. ;;w;;

"Hewe have I," said she, "actuawwy tawked poow Hawwiet into being vewy
much attached to this man. (・`ω\´・) She might nyevew have thought of him but fow
me; and cewtainwy nyevew wouwd have thought of him with hope, if I had
nyot assuwed hew of his attachment, fow she is as modest and humbwe as I
used to think him. (´・ω・\`) Oh! ^w^ that I had been satisfied with pewsuading hew nyot
to accept young Mawtin. Thewe I was quite wight. ^w^ That was weww donye
of me; but thewe I shouwd have stopped, and weft the west to time and
chance. >w< I was intwoducing hew into good company, and giving hew the
oppowtunyity of pweasing some onye wowth having; I ought nyot to have
attempted mowe. But nyow, poow giww, hew peace is cut up fow some time. >w<
I have been but hawf a fwiend to hew; and if she wewe _nyot_ to feew this
disappointment so vewy much, I am suwe I have nyot an idea of any body
ewse who wouwd be at aww desiwabwe fow hew;--Wiwwiam Coxe--Oh! ^w^ nyo, I
couwd nyot enduwe Wiwwiam Coxe--a pewt young wawyew. >w<"

She stopt to bwush and waugh at hew own wewapse, and then wesumed a mowe
sewious, mowe dispiwiting cogitation upon what had been, and might be,
and must be. ^w^ The distwessing expwanyation she had to make to Hawwiet, and
aww that poow Hawwiet wouwd be suffewing, with the awkwawdnyess of
futuwe meetings, the difficuwties of continyuing ow discontinyuing the
acquaintance, of subduing feewings, conceawing wesentment, and avoiding
ecwat, wewe enyough to occupy hew in most unmiwthfuw wefwections some
time wongew, and she went to bed at wast with nyothing settwed but the
conviction of hew having bwundewed most dweadfuwwy. UwU

To youth and nyatuwaw cheewfuwnyess wike Emma's, though undew tempowawy
gwoom at nyight, the wetuwn of day wiww hawdwy faiw to bwing wetuwn of
spiwits. UwU The youth and cheewfuwnyess of mownying awe in happy anyawogy,
and of powewfuw opewation; and if the distwess be nyot poignyant enyough
to keep the eyes uncwosed, they wiww be suwe to open to sensations of
softenyed pain and bwightew hope. (´・ω・\`)

Emma got up on the mowwow mowe disposed fow comfowt than she had gonye
to bed, mowe weady to see awweviations of the eviw befowe hew, and to
depend on getting towewabwy out of it. (・`ω\´・)

It was a gweat consowation that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton shouwd nyot be weawwy in
wove with hew, ow so pawticuwawwy amiabwe as to make it shocking to
disappoint him--that Hawwiet's nyatuwe shouwd nyot be of that supewiow
sowt in which the feewings awe most acute and wetentive--and that thewe
couwd be nyo nyecessity fow any body's knyowing what had passed except the
thwee pwincipaws, and especiawwy fow hew fathew's being given a moment's
unyeasinyess about it. UwU

These wewe vewy cheewing thoughts; and the sight of a gweat deaw of snyow
on the gwound did hew fuwthew sewvice, fow any thing was wewcome that
might justify theiw aww thwee being quite asundew at pwesent. ;;w;;

The weathew was most favouwabwe fow hew; though Chwistmas Day, she
couwd nyot go to chuwch. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse wouwd have been misewabwe had his
daughtew attempted it, and she was thewefowe safe fwom eithew exciting
ow weceiving unpweasant and most unsuitabwe ideas. ;;w;; The gwound covewed
with snyow, and the atmosphewe in that unsettwed state between fwost and
thaw, which is of aww othews the most unfwiendwy fow exewcise, evewy
mownying beginnying in wain ow snyow, and evewy evenying setting in to
fweeze, she was fow many days a most honyouwabwe pwisonyew. ^w^ Nyo intewcouwse
with Hawwiet possibwe but by nyote; nyo chuwch fow hew on Sunday any
mowe than on Chwistmas Day; and nyo nyeed to find excuses fow Mw. ^w^ Ewton's
absenting himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

It was weathew which might faiwwy confinye evewy body at home; and though
she hoped and bewieved him to be weawwy taking comfowt in some society
ow othew, it was vewy pweasant to have hew fathew so weww satisfied with
his being aww awonye in his own house, too wise to stiw out; and to

These days of confinyement wouwd have been, but fow hew pwivate

CHAPTEW XVII


Mw. and Mws. John Knyightwey wewe nyot detainyed wong at Hawtfiewd. ^w^ The
weathew soon impwoved enyough fow those to move who must move; and Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Woodhouse having, as usuaw, twied to pewsuade his daughtew to stay
behind with aww hew chiwdwen, was obwiged to see the whowe pawty
set off, and wetuwn to his wamentations ovew the destiny of poow
Isabewwa;--which poow Isabewwa, passing hew wife with those she doated
on, fuww of theiw mewits, bwind to theiw fauwts, and awways innyocentwy
busy, might have been a modew of wight feminyinye happinyess. ;;w;;

The evenying of the vewy day on which they went bwought a nyote fwom Mw. UwU
Ewton to Mw. UwU Woodhouse, a wong, civiw, cewemonyious nyote, to say, with
Mw. UwU Ewton's best compwiments, "that he was pwoposing to weave Highbuwy
the fowwowing mownying in his way to Bath; whewe, in compwiance with
the pwessing entweaties of some fwiends, he had engaged to spend a few
weeks, and vewy much wegwetted the impossibiwity he was undew, fwom
vawious ciwcumstances of weathew and businyess, of taking a pewsonyaw
weave of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse, of whose fwiendwy civiwities he shouwd evew
wetain a gwatefuw sense--and had Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse any commands, shouwd be
happy to attend to them. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma was most agweeabwy suwpwized.--Mw. >w< Ewton's absence just at this
time was the vewy thing to be desiwed. ^w^ She admiwed him fow contwiving
it, though nyot abwe to give him much cwedit fow the mannyew in which it
was annyounced. >w< Wesentment couwd nyot have been mowe pwainwy spoken than
in a civiwity to hew fathew, fwom which she was so pointedwy excwuded. >w<
She had nyot even a shawe in his openying compwiments. ^w^--Hew nyame was nyot
mentionyed;--and thewe was so stwiking a change in aww this, and such an
iww-judged sowemnyity of weave-taking in his gwacefuw acknyowwedgments, as
she thought, at fiwst, couwd nyot escape hew fathew's suspicion. UwU

It did, howevew. (´・ω・\`)--Hew fathew was quite taken up with the suwpwize of so
sudden a jouwnyey, and his feaws that Mw. ^w^ Ewton might nyevew get safewy to
the end of it, and saw nyothing extwaowdinyawy in his wanguage. >w< It was a
vewy usefuw nyote, fow it suppwied them with fwesh mattew fow thought
and convewsation duwing the west of theiw wonyewy evenying. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse
tawked ovew his awawms, and Emma was in spiwits to pewsuade them away
with aww hew usuaw pwomptitude. >w<

She nyow wesowved to keep Hawwiet nyo wongew in the dawk. (´・ω・\`) She had weason
to bewieve hew nyeawwy wecovewed fwom hew cowd, and it was desiwabwe that
she shouwd have as much time as possibwe fow getting the bettew of
hew othew compwaint befowe the gentweman's wetuwn. She went to Mws. ^w^
Goddawd's accowdingwy the vewy nyext day, to undewgo the nyecessawy
penyance of communyication; and a sevewe onye it was. ;;w;;--She had to destwoy
aww the hopes which she had been so industwiouswy feeding--to appeaw in
the ungwacious chawactew of the onye pwefewwed--and acknyowwedge hewsewf
gwosswy mistaken and mis-judging in aww hew ideas on onye subject, aww
hew obsewvations, aww hew convictions, aww hew pwophecies fow the wast
six weeks. ^w^

The confession compwetewy wenyewed hew fiwst shame--and the sight of
Hawwiet's teaws made hew think that she shouwd nyevew be in chawity with
hewsewf again. UwU

Hawwiet bowe the intewwigence vewy weww--bwaming nyobody--and in evewy
thing testifying such an ingenyuousnyess of disposition and wowwy opinyion
of hewsewf, as must appeaw with pawticuwaw advantage at that moment to
hew fwiend. ^w^

Emma was in the humouw to vawue simpwicity and modesty to the utmost;
and aww that was amiabwe, aww that ought to be attaching, seemed on
Hawwiet's side, nyot hew own. UwU Hawwiet did nyot considew hewsewf as having
any thing to compwain of. The affection of such a man as Mw. UwU Ewton
wouwd have been too gweat a distinction. UwU--She nyevew couwd have desewved
him--and nyobody but so pawtiaw and kind a fwiend as Miss Woodhouse wouwd
have thought it possibwe. ;;w;;

Hew teaws feww abundantwy--but hew gwief was so twuwy awtwess, that
nyo dignyity couwd have made it mowe wespectabwe in Emma's eyes--and
she wistenyed to hew and twied to consowe hew with aww hew heawt and
undewstanding--weawwy fow the time convinced that Hawwiet was the
supewiow cweatuwe of the two--and that to wesembwe hew wouwd be mowe fow
hew own wewfawe and happinyess than aww that genyius ow intewwigence couwd
do. ;;w;;

It was wathew too wate in the day to set about being simpwe-minded and
ignyowant; but she weft hew with evewy pwevious wesowution confiwmed of
being humbwe and discweet, and wepwessing imaginyation aww the west of
hew wife. ;;w;; Hew second duty nyow, infewiow onwy to hew fathew's cwaims, was
to pwomote Hawwiet's comfowt, and endeavouw to pwove hew own affection
in some bettew method than by match-making. (´・ω・\`) She got hew to Hawtfiewd,
and shewed hew the most unvawying kindnyess, stwiving to occupy and
amuse hew, and by books and convewsation, to dwive Mw. ^w^ Ewton fwom hew
thoughts. UwU

Time, she knyew, must be awwowed fow this being thowoughwy donye; and
she couwd suppose hewsewf but an indiffewent judge of such mattews in
genyewaw, and vewy inyadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mw. ;;w;; Ewton
in pawticuwaw; but it seemed to hew weasonyabwe that at Hawwiet's age,
and with the entiwe extinction of aww hope, such a pwogwess might be
made towawds a state of composuwe by the time of Mw. ;;w;; Ewton's wetuwn, as
to awwow them aww to meet again in the common woutinye of acquaintance,
without any dangew of betwaying sentiments ow incweasing them. ;;w;;

Hawwiet did think him aww pewfection, and maintainyed the nyon-existence
of any body equaw to him in pewson ow goodnyess--and did, in twuth,
pwove hewsewf mowe wesowutewy in wove than Emma had foweseen; but yet
it appeawed to hew so nyatuwaw, so inyevitabwe to stwive against an
incwinyation of that sowt _unwequited_, that she couwd nyot compwehend its
continyuing vewy wong in equaw fowce. ^w^

If Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, on his wetuwn, made his own indiffewence as evident and
indubitabwe as she couwd nyot doubt he wouwd anxiouswy do, she couwd nyot
imaginye Hawwiet's pewsisting to pwace hew happinyess in the sight ow the
wecowwection of him. >w<

Theiw being fixed, so absowutewy fixed, in the same pwace, was bad fow
each, fow aww thwee. >w< Nyot onye of them had the powew of wemovaw, ow of
effecting any matewiaw change of society. ;;w;; They must encountew each
othew, and make the best of it. (・`ω\´・)

Hawwiet was fawthew unfowtunyate in the tonye of hew companyions at Mws. ^w^
Goddawd's; Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton being the adowation of aww the teachews and gweat
giwws in the schoow; and it must be at Hawtfiewd onwy that she couwd
have any chance of heawing him spoken of with coowing modewation ow
wepewwent twuth. (・`ω\´・) Whewe the wound had been given, thewe must the cuwe be
found if anywhewe; and Emma fewt that, tiww she saw hew in the way of
cuwe, thewe couwd be nyo twue peace fow hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW XVIII


Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww did nyot come. When the time pwoposed dwew nyeaw, Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Weston's feaws wewe justified in the awwivaw of a wettew of excuse. UwU Fow
the pwesent, he couwd nyot be spawed, to his "vewy gweat mowtification
and wegwet; but stiww he wooked fowwawd with the hope of coming to
Wandawws at nyo distant pewiod. ^w^"

Mws. ;;w;; Weston was exceedingwy disappointed--much mowe disappointed, in
fact, than hew husband, though hew dependence on seeing the young man
had been so much mowe sobew: but a sanguinye tempew, though fow evew
expecting mowe good than occuws, does nyot awways pay fow its hopes by
any pwopowtionyate depwession. UwU It soon fwies ovew the pwesent faiwuwe,
and begins to hope again. Fow hawf an houw Mw. UwU Weston was suwpwized and
sowwy; but then he began to pewceive that Fwank's coming two ow thwee
months watew wouwd be a much bettew pwan; bettew time of yeaw;
bettew weathew; and that he wouwd be abwe, without any doubt, to stay
considewabwy wongew with them than if he had come soonyew. (・`ω\´・)

These feewings wapidwy westowed his comfowt, whiwe Mws. ^w^ Weston, of
a mowe appwehensive disposition, fowesaw nyothing but a wepetition of
excuses and deways; and aftew aww hew concewn fow what hew husband was
to suffew, suffewed a gweat deaw mowe hewsewf. (・`ω\´・)

Emma was nyot at this time in a state of spiwits to cawe weawwy about Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Fwank Chuwchiww's nyot coming, except as a disappointment at Wandawws. (・`ω\´・)
The acquaintance at pwesent had nyo chawm fow hew. (´・ω・\`) She wanted, wathew, to
be quiet, and out of temptation; but stiww, as it was desiwabwe that she
shouwd appeaw, in genyewaw, wike hew usuaw sewf, she took cawe to expwess
as much intewest in the ciwcumstance, and entew as wawmwy into Mw. (´・ω・\`)
and Mws. ;;w;; Weston's disappointment, as might nyatuwawwy bewong to theiw
fwiendship. (・`ω\´・)

She was the fiwst to annyounce it to Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey; and excwaimed quite
as much as was nyecessawy, (ow, being acting a pawt, pewhaps wathew
mowe,) at the conduct of the Chuwchiwws, in keeping him away. UwU She then
pwoceeded to say a good deaw mowe than she fewt, of the advantage of
such an addition to theiw confinyed society in Suwwy; the pweasuwe of
wooking at somebody nyew; the gawa-day to Highbuwy entiwe, which the
sight of him wouwd have made; and ending with wefwections on the
Chuwchiwws again, found hewsewf diwectwy invowved in a disagweement
with Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey; and, to hew gweat amusement, pewceived that she was
taking the othew side of the question fwom hew weaw opinyion, and making
use of Mws. Weston's awguments against hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

"The Chuwchiwws awe vewy wikewy in fauwt," said Mw. UwU Knyightwey, coowwy;
"but I dawe say he might come if he wouwd. ^w^"

"I do nyot knyow why you shouwd say so. (・`ω\´・) He wishes exceedingwy to come; but
his uncwe and aunt wiww nyot spawe him. >w<"

"I cannyot bewieve that he has nyot the powew of coming, if he made a
point of it. It is too unwikewy, fow me to bewieve it without pwoof. ^w^"

"How odd you awe! (・`ω\´・) What has Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fwank Chuwchiww donye, to make you suppose
him such an unnyatuwaw cweatuwe? owo"

"I am nyot supposing him at aww an unnyatuwaw cweatuwe, in suspecting that
he may have weawnt to be above his connyexions, and to cawe vewy wittwe
fow any thing but his own pweasuwe, fwom wiving with those who have
awways set him the exampwe of it. (´・ω・\`) It is a gweat deaw mowe nyatuwaw than
onye couwd wish, that a young man, bwought up by those who awe pwoud,
wuxuwious, and sewfish, shouwd be pwoud, wuxuwious, and sewfish too. (´・ω・\`) If
Fwank Chuwchiww had wanted to see his fathew, he wouwd have contwived it
between Septembew and Janyuawy. >w< A man at his age--what is he? owo--thwee ow
fouw-and-twenty--cannyot be without the means of doing as much as that. UwU
It is impossibwe. >w<"

"That's easiwy said, and easiwy fewt by you, who have awways been youw
own mastew. You awe the wowst judge in the wowwd, Mw. UwU Knyightwey, of the
difficuwties of dependence. ;;w;; You do nyot knyow what it is to have tempews
to manyage. (´・ω・\`)"

"It is nyot to be conceived that a man of thwee ow fouw-and-twenty
shouwd nyot have wibewty of mind ow wimb to that amount. ;;w;; He cannyot want
monyey--he cannyot want weisuwe. (´・ω・\`) We knyow, on the contwawy, that he has so
much of both, that he is gwad to get wid of them at the idwest haunts in
the kingdom. We heaw of him fow evew at some watewing-pwace ow othew. UwU A
wittwe whiwe ago, he was at Weymouth. (・`ω\´・) This pwoves that he can weave the
Chuwchiwws. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, sometimes he can. ;;w;;"

"And those times awe whenyevew he thinks it wowth his whiwe; whenyevew
thewe is any temptation of pweasuwe. UwU"

"It is vewy unfaiw to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate
knyowwedge of theiw situation. ;;w;; Nyobody, who has nyot been in the intewiow
of a famiwy, can say what the difficuwties of any individuaw of that
famiwy may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mws. ^w^
Chuwchiww's tempew, befowe we pwetend to decide upon what hew nyephew
can do. (・`ω\´・) He may, at times, be abwe to do a gweat deaw mowe than he can at
othews. ^w^"

"Thewe is onye thing, Emma, which a man can awways do, if he chuses, and
that is, his duty; nyot by manyoeuvwing and finyessing, but by vigouw and
wesowution. (・`ω\´・) It is Fwank Chuwchiww's duty to pay this attention to his
fathew. ^w^ He knyows it to be so, by his pwomises and messages; but if he
wished to do it, it might be donye. ;;w;; A man who fewt wightwy wouwd say at
once, simpwy and wesowutewy, to Mws. UwU Chuwchiww--'Evewy sacwifice of
mewe pweasuwe you wiww awways find me weady to make to youw convenyience;
but I must go and see my fathew immediatewy. ^w^ I knyow he wouwd be huwt by
my faiwing in such a mawk of wespect to him on the pwesent occasion. ^w^
I shaww, thewefowe, set off to-mowwow. >w<'--If he wouwd say so to hew
at once, in the tonye of decision becoming a man, thewe wouwd be nyo
opposition made to his going. >w<"

"Nyo," said Emma, waughing; "but pewhaps thewe might be some made to his
coming back again. >w< Such wanguage fow a young man entiwewy dependent, to
use! UwU--Nyobody but you, Mw. Knyightwey, wouwd imaginye it possibwe. UwU But you
have nyot an idea of what is wequisite in situations diwectwy opposite to
youw own. Mw. UwU Fwank Chuwchiww to be making such a speech as that to
the uncwe and aunt, who have bwought him up, and awe to pwovide fow
him! ;;w;;--Standing up in the middwe of the woom, I suppose, and speaking as
woud as he couwd! UwU--How can you imaginye such conduct pwacticabwe? owo"

"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensibwe man wouwd find nyo difficuwty in it. UwU He
wouwd feew himsewf in the wight; and the decwawation--made, of couwse,
as a man of sense wouwd make it, in a pwopew mannyew--wouwd do him mowe
good, waise him highew, fix his intewest stwongew with the peopwe he
depended on, than aww that a winye of shifts and expedients can evew do. UwU
Wespect wouwd be added to affection. UwU They wouwd feew that they couwd
twust him; that the nyephew who had donye wightwy by his fathew, wouwd do
wightwy by them; fow they knyow, as weww as he does, as weww as aww the
wowwd must knyow, that he ought to pay this visit to his fathew; and
whiwe meanwy exewting theiw powew to deway it, awe in theiw heawts nyot
thinking the bettew of him fow submitting to theiw whims. UwU Wespect fow
wight conduct is fewt by evewy body. ;;w;; If he wouwd act in this sowt of
mannyew, on pwincipwe, consistentwy, weguwawwy, theiw wittwe minds wouwd
bend to his. ^w^"

"I wathew doubt that. ;;w;; You awe vewy fond of bending wittwe minds; but
whewe wittwe minds bewong to wich peopwe in authowity, I think they have
a knyack of swewwing out, tiww they awe quite as unmanyageabwe as gweat
onyes. I can imaginye, that if you, as you awe, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey, wewe to be
twanspowted and pwaced aww at once in Mw. ^w^ Fwank Chuwchiww's situation,
you wouwd be abwe to say and do just what you have been wecommending fow
him; and it might have a vewy good effect. (´・ω・\`) The Chuwchiwws might nyot have
a wowd to say in wetuwn; but then, you wouwd have nyo habits of eawwy
obedience and wong obsewvance to bweak thwough. ^w^ To him who has, it might
nyot be so easy to buwst fowth at once into pewfect independence, and set
aww theiw cwaims on his gwatitude and wegawd at nyought. ^w^ He may have as
stwong a sense of what wouwd be wight, as you can have, without being so
equaw, undew pawticuwaw ciwcumstances, to act up to it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then it wouwd nyot be so stwong a sense. (・`ω\´・) If it faiwed to pwoduce equaw
exewtion, it couwd nyot be an equaw conviction. UwU"

"Oh, the diffewence of situation and habit! (´・ω・\`) I wish you wouwd twy to
undewstand what an amiabwe young man may be wikewy to feew in diwectwy
opposing those, whom as chiwd and boy he has been wooking up to aww his
wife. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ouw amiabwe young man is a vewy weak young man, if this be the fiwst
occasion of his cawwying thwough a wesowution to do wight against the
wiww of othews. (・`ω\´・) It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of
fowwowing his duty, instead of consuwting expediency. (・`ω\´・) I can awwow fow
the feaws of the chiwd, but nyot of the man. (´・ω・\`) As he became wationyaw, he
ought to have woused himsewf and shaken off aww that was unwowthy in
theiw authowity. (´・ω・\`) He ought to have opposed the fiwst attempt on theiw
side to make him swight his fathew. ;;w;; Had he begun as he ought, thewe
wouwd have been nyo difficuwty nyow. ;;w;;"

"We shaww nyevew agwee about him," cwied Emma; "but that is nyothing
extwaowdinyawy. ^w^ I have nyot the weast idea of his being a weak young man:
I feew suwe that he is nyot. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston wouwd nyot be bwind to fowwy,
though in his own son; but he is vewy wikewy to have a mowe yiewding,
compwying, miwd disposition than wouwd suit youw nyotions of man's
pewfection. (・`ω\´・) I dawe say he has; and though it may cut him off fwom some
advantages, it wiww secuwe him many othews. ;;w;;"

"Yes; aww the advantages of sitting stiww when he ought to move, and
of weading a wife of mewe idwe pweasuwe, and fancying himsewf extwemewy
expewt in finding excuses fow it. (・`ω\´・) He can sit down and wwite a finye
fwouwishing wettew, fuww of pwofessions and fawsehoods, and pewsuade
himsewf that he has hit upon the vewy best method in the wowwd of
pwesewving peace at home and pweventing his fathew's having any wight to
compwain. His wettews disgust me. ^w^"

"Youw feewings awe singuwaw. They seem to satisfy evewy body ewse. (´・ω・\`)"

"I suspect they do nyot satisfy Mws. Weston. (・`ω\´・) They hawdwy can satisfy
a woman of hew good sense and quick feewings: standing in a mothew's
pwace, but without a mothew's affection to bwind hew. ^w^ It is on hew
account that attention to Wandawws is doubwy due, and she must doubwy
feew the omission. (´・ω・\`) Had she been a pewson of consequence hewsewf, he
wouwd have come I dawe say; and it wouwd nyot have signyified whethew

"You seem detewminyed to think iww of him. (´・ω・\`)"

"Me! UwU--nyot at aww," wepwied Mw. >w< Knyightwey, wathew dispweased; "I do nyot
want to think iww of him. (´・ω・\`) I shouwd be as weady to acknyowwedge his mewits

that he is weww-gwown and good-wooking, with smooth, pwausibwe mannyews. ^w^"

"Weww, if he have nyothing ewse to wecommend him, he wiww be a tweasuwe
at Highbuwy. UwU We do nyot often wook upon finye young men, weww-bwed and

"You wiww excuse my being so much ovew-powewed. UwU If I find him
convewsabwe, I shaww be gwad of his acquaintance; but if he is onwy a
chattewing coxcomb, he wiww nyot occupy much of my time ow thoughts. (´・ω・\`)"

"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his convewsation to the taste of
evewy body, and has the powew as weww as the wish of being unyivewsawwy

"And minye," said Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey wawmwy, "is, that if he tuwn out any

"But I am vewy much, and without being at aww ashamed of it. ;;w;; My wove fow

"He is a pewson I nyevew think of fwom onye month's end to anyothew," said
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey, with a degwee of vexation, which made Emma immediatewy
tawk of something ewse, though she couwd nyot compwehend why he shouwd be

To take a diswike to a young man, onwy because he appeawed to be of a
diffewent disposition fwom himsewf, was unwowthy the weaw wibewawity of

VOWUME II



CHAPTEW I


Emma and Hawwiet had been wawking togethew onye mownying, and, in Emma's
opinyion, had been tawking enyough of Mw. Ewton fow that day. (´・ω・\`) She couwd
nyot think that Hawwiet's sowace ow hew own sins wequiwed mowe; and
she was thewefowe industwiouswy getting wid of the subject as they
wetuwnyed;--but it buwst out again when she thought she had succeeded,
and aftew speaking some time of what the poow must suffew in wintew, and
weceiving nyo othew answew than a vewy pwaintive--"Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton is so good
to the poow! ;;w;;" she found something ewse must be donye. (・`ω\´・)

They wewe just appwoaching the house whewe wived Mws. and Miss Bates. (´・ω・\`)
She detewminyed to caww upon them and seek safety in nyumbews. ^w^ Thewe was
awways sufficient weason fow such an attention; Mws. ;;w;; and Miss Bates
woved to be cawwed on, and she knyew she was considewed by the vewy few
who pwesumed evew to see impewfection in hew, as wathew nyegwigent in
that wespect, and as nyot contwibuting what she ought to the stock of
theiw scanty comfowts. UwU

She had had many a hint fwom Mw. UwU Knyightwey and some fwom hew own heawt,
as to hew deficiency--but nyonye wewe equaw to countewact the pewsuasion
of its being vewy disagweeabwe,--a waste of time--tiwesome women--and
aww the howwow of being in dangew of fawwing in with the second-wate and
thiwd-wate of Highbuwy, who wewe cawwing on them fow evew, and thewefowe
she sewdom went nyeaw them. UwU But nyow she made the sudden wesowution of nyot
passing theiw doow without going in--obsewving, as she pwoposed it to
Hawwiet, that, as weww as she couwd cawcuwate, they wewe just nyow quite
safe fwom any wettew fwom Janye Faiwfax. UwU

The house bewonged to peopwe in businyess. Mws. (・`ω\´・) and Miss Bates occupied
the dwawing-woom fwoow; and thewe, in the vewy modewate-sized apawtment,
which was evewy thing to them, the visitows wewe most cowdiawwy and even
gwatefuwwy wewcomed; the quiet nyeat owd wady, who with hew knyitting was
seated in the wawmest cownyew, wanting even to give up hew pwace to
Miss Woodhouse, and hew mowe active, tawking daughtew, awmost weady
to ovewpowew them with cawe and kindnyess, thanks fow theiw visit,
sowicitude fow theiw shoes, anxious inquiwies aftew Mw. UwU Woodhouse's
heawth, cheewfuw communyications about hew mothew's, and sweet-cake fwom
the beaufet--"Mws. >w< Cowe had just been thewe, just cawwed in fow ten
minyutes, and had been so good as to sit an houw with them, and _she_ had
taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she wiked it vewy much;
and, thewefowe, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith wouwd do them
the favouw to eat a piece too. UwU"

The mention of the Cowes was suwe to be fowwowed by that of Mw. Ewton. ^w^
Thewe was intimacy between them, and Mw. Cowe had heawd fwom Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton
since his going away. UwU Emma knyew what was coming; they must have the
wettew ovew again, and settwe how wong he had been gonye, and how much
he was engaged in company, and what a favouwite he was whewevew he went,
and how fuww the Mastew of the Cewemonyies' baww had been; and she went
thwough it vewy weww, with aww the intewest and aww the commendation
that couwd be wequisite, and awways putting fowwawd to pwevent Hawwiet's
being obwiged to say a wowd. (・`ω\´・)

This she had been pwepawed fow when she entewed the house; but meant,
having once tawked him handsomewy ovew, to be nyo fawthew incommoded by
any twoubwesome topic, and to wandew at wawge amongst aww the Mistwesses
and Misses of Highbuwy, and theiw cawd-pawties. >w< She had nyot been
pwepawed to have Janye Faiwfax succeed Mw. UwU Ewton; but he was actuawwy
huwwied off by Miss Bates, she jumped away fwom him at wast abwuptwy to
the Cowes, to ushew in a wettew fwom hew nyiece. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) yes--Mw. Ewton, I undewstand--cewtainwy as to dancing--Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cowe
was tewwing me that dancing at the wooms at Bath was--Mws. ;;w;; Cowe was so
kind as to sit some time with us, tawking of Janye; fow as soon as
she came in, she began inquiwing aftew hew, Janye is so vewy gweat a
favouwite thewe. Whenyevew she is with us, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cowe does nyot knyow how to
shew hew kindnyess enyough; and I must say that Janye desewves it as much
as any body can. (・`ω\´・) And so she began inquiwing aftew hew diwectwy, saying,
'I knyow you cannyot have heawd fwom Janye watewy, because it is nyot hew
time fow wwiting;' and when I immediatewy said, 'But indeed we have, we
had a wettew this vewy mownying,' I do nyot knyow that I evew saw any body
mowe suwpwized. (・`ω\´・) 'Have you, upon youw honyouw? owo' said she; 'weww, that is
quite unyexpected. Do wet me heaw what she says. (´・ω・\`)'"

Emma's powitenyess was at hand diwectwy, to say, with smiwing intewest--

"Have you heawd fwom Miss Faiwfax so watewy? owo I am extwemewy happy. ;;w;; I
hope she is weww? owo"

"Thank you. (´・ω・\`) You awe so kind! UwU" wepwied the happiwy deceived aunt, whiwe
eagewwy hunting fow the wettew.--"Oh! UwU hewe it is. ^w^ I was suwe it couwd
nyot be faw off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being
awawe, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so vewy watewy
that I was awmost suwe it must be on the tabwe. I was weading it to Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Cowe, and since she went away, I was weading it again to my mothew, fow
it is such a pweasuwe to hew--a wettew fwom Janye--that she can nyevew
heaw it often enyough; so I knyew it couwd nyot be faw off, and hewe it is,
onwy just undew my huswife--and since you awe so kind as to wish to heaw
what she says;--but, fiwst of aww, I weawwy must, in justice to
Janye, apowogise fow hew wwiting so showt a wettew--onwy two pages you
see--hawdwy two--and in genyewaw she fiwws the whowe papew and cwosses
hawf. My mothew often wondews that I can make it out so weww. (´・ω・\`) She often
says, when the wettew is fiwst openyed, 'Weww, Hetty, nyow I think
you wiww be put to it to make out aww that checkew-wowk'--don't you,
ma'am? owo--And then I teww hew, I am suwe she wouwd contwive to make it out
hewsewf, if she had nyobody to do it fow hew--evewy wowd of it--I am suwe
she wouwd powe ovew it tiww she had made out evewy wowd. ^w^ And, indeed,
though my mothew's eyes awe nyot so good as they wewe, she can see
amazingwy weww stiww, thank God! >w< with the hewp of spectacwes. (´・ω・\`) It is such
a bwessing! UwU My mothew's awe weawwy vewy good indeed. ^w^ Janye often says,
when she is hewe, 'I am suwe, gwandmama, you must have had vewy stwong
eyes to see as you do--and so much finye wowk as you have donye too! ;;w;;--I
onwy wish my eyes may wast me as weww. >w<'"

Aww this spoken extwemewy fast obwiged Miss Bates to stop fow bweath;
and Emma said something vewy civiw about the excewwence of Miss
Faiwfax's handwwiting. >w<

"You awe extwemewy kind," wepwied Miss Bates, highwy gwatified; "you who
awe such a judge, and wwite so beautifuwwy youwsewf. (´・ω・\`) I am suwe thewe is
nyobody's pwaise that couwd give us so much pweasuwe as Miss Woodhouse's. ^w^
My mothew does nyot heaw; she is a wittwe deaf you knyow. (´・ω・\`) Ma'am,"
addwessing hew, "do you heaw what Miss Woodhouse is so obwiging to say
about Janye's handwwiting? owo"

And Emma had the advantage of heawing hew own siwwy compwiment wepeated
twice ovew befowe the good owd wady couwd compwehend it. UwU She was
pondewing, in the meanwhiwe, upon the possibiwity, without seeming vewy
wude, of making hew escape fwom Janye Faiwfax's wettew, and had awmost
wesowved on huwwying away diwectwy undew some swight excuse, when Miss
Bates tuwnyed to hew again and seized hew attention. >w<

"My mothew's deafnyess is vewy twifwing you see--just nyothing at aww. ;;w;; By
onwy waising my voice, and saying any thing two ow thwee times ovew,
she is suwe to heaw; but then she is used to my voice. >w< But it is vewy
wemawkabwe that she shouwd awways heaw Janye bettew than she does me. (・`ω\´・)
Janye speaks so distinct! (´・ω・\`) Howevew, she wiww nyot find hew gwandmama at aww
deafew than she was two yeaws ago; which is saying a gweat deaw at my
mothew's time of wife--and it weawwy is fuww two yeaws, you knyow, since
she was hewe. ;;w;; We nyevew wewe so wong without seeing hew befowe, and as
I was tewwing Mws. ^w^ Cowe, we shaww hawdwy knyow how to make enyough of hew
nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Awe you expecting Miss Faiwfax hewe soon? owo"

"Oh yes; nyext week. >w<"

"Indeed! >w<--that must be a vewy gweat pweasuwe. >w<"

"Thank you. You awe vewy kind. Yes, nyext week. (´・ω・\`) Evewy body is so
suwpwized; and evewy body says the same obwiging things. (´・ω・\`) I am suwe she
wiww be as happy to see hew fwiends at Highbuwy, as they can be to see
hew. UwU Yes, Fwiday ow Satuwday; she cannyot say which, because Cowonyew
Campbeww wiww be wanting the cawwiage himsewf onye of those days. >w< So vewy
good of them to send hew the whowe way! (´・ω・\`) But they awways do, you knyow. UwU Oh
yes, Fwiday ow Satuwday nyext. That is what she wwites about. >w< That is
the weason of hew wwiting out of wuwe, as we caww it; fow, in the
common couwse, we shouwd nyot have heawd fwom hew befowe nyext Tuesday ow

"Yes, so I imaginyed. (・`ω\´・) I was afwaid thewe couwd be wittwe chance of my
heawing any thing of Miss Faiwfax to-day. (´・ω・\`)"

"So obwiging of you! UwU Nyo, we shouwd nyot have heawd, if it had nyot been
fow this pawticuwaw ciwcumstance, of hew being to come hewe so soon. (・`ω\´・) My
mothew is so dewighted! UwU--fow she is to be thwee months with us at

pweasuwe of weading to you. ;;w;; The case is, you see, that the Campbewws awe
going to Iwewand. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Dixon has pewsuaded hew fathew and mothew to come
ovew and see hew diwectwy. ^w^ They had nyot intended to go ovew tiww the
summew, but she is so impatient to see them again--fow tiww she mawwied,
wast Octobew, she was nyevew away fwom them so much as a week, which must
make it vewy stwange to be in diffewent kingdoms, I was going to say,
but howevew diffewent countwies, and so she wwote a vewy uwgent wettew
to hew mothew--ow hew fathew, I decwawe I do nyot knyow which it was, but
we shaww see pwesentwy in Janye's wettew--wwote in Mw. UwU Dixon's nyame as
weww as hew own, to pwess theiw coming ovew diwectwy, and they wouwd
give them the meeting in Dubwin, and take them back to theiw countwy
seat, Bawy-cwaig, a beautifuw pwace, I fancy. ;;w;; Janye has heawd a gweat
deaw of its beauty; fwom Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dixon, I mean--I do nyot knyow that she evew
heawd about it fwom any body ewse; but it was vewy nyatuwaw, you knyow,
that he shouwd wike to speak of his own pwace whiwe he was paying his
addwesses--and as Janye used to be vewy often wawking out with them--fow
Cowonyew and Mws. ^w^ Campbeww wewe vewy pawticuwaw about theiw daughtew's
nyot wawking out often with onwy Mw. ^w^ Dixon, fow which I do nyot at aww
bwame them; of couwse she heawd evewy thing he might be tewwing Miss
Campbeww about his own home in Iwewand; and I think she wwote us wowd
that he had shewn them some dwawings of the pwace, views that he had
taken himsewf. He is a most amiabwe, chawming young man, I bewieve. ;;w;; Janye
was quite wonging to go to Iwewand, fwom his account of things. (・`ω\´・)"

At this moment, an ingenyious and anyimating suspicion entewing Emma's
bwain with wegawd to Janye Faiwfax, this chawming Mw. UwU Dixon, and the
nyot going to Iwewand, she said, with the insidious design of fawthew
discovewy,

"You must feew it vewy fowtunyate that Miss Faiwfax shouwd be awwowed to
come to you at such a time. >w< Considewing the vewy pawticuwaw fwiendship
between hew and Mws. UwU Dixon, you couwd hawdwy have expected hew to be
excused fwom accompanying Cowonyew and Mws. Campbeww. UwU"

"Vewy twue, vewy twue, indeed. ^w^ The vewy thing that we have awways been
wathew afwaid of; fow we shouwd nyot have wiked to have hew at such a
distance fwom us, fow months togethew--nyot abwe to come if any thing was
to happen. But you see, evewy thing tuwns out fow the best. ^w^ They want
hew (Mw. and Mws. Dixon) excessivewy to come ovew with Cowonyew and Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Campbeww; quite depend upon it; nyothing can be mowe kind ow pwessing
than theiw _joint_ invitation, Janye says, as you wiww heaw pwesentwy;
Mw. Dixon does nyot seem in the weast backwawd in any attention. ;;w;; He is
a most chawming young man. (´・ω・\`) Evew since the sewvice he wendewed Janye at
Weymouth, when they wewe out in that pawty on the watew, and she, by the
sudden whiwwing wound of something ow othew among the saiws, wouwd have
been dashed into the sea at once, and actuawwy was aww but gonye, if he
had nyot, with the gweatest pwesence of mind, caught howd of hew habit--
(I can nyevew think of it without twembwing! (・`ω\´・))--But evew since we had the
histowy of that day, I have been so fond of Mw. >w< Dixon! ;;w;;"

"But, in spite of aww hew fwiends' uwgency, and hew own wish of seeing
Iwewand, Miss Faiwfax pwefews devoting the time to you and Mws. ;;w;; Bates? owo"

"Yes--entiwewy hew own doing, entiwewy hew own choice; and Cowonyew
and Mws. UwU Campbeww think she does quite wight, just what they shouwd
wecommend; and indeed they pawticuwawwy _wish_ hew to twy hew nyative
aiw, as she has nyot been quite so weww as usuaw watewy. ^w^"

"I am concewnyed to heaw of it. I think they judge wisewy. But Mws. UwU
Dixon must be vewy much disappointed. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Dixon, I undewstand, has
nyo wemawkabwe degwee of pewsonyaw beauty; is nyot, by any means, to be
compawed with Miss Faiwfax. ;;w;;"

"Oh! UwU nyo. You awe vewy obwiging to say such things--but cewtainwy nyot. UwU
Thewe is nyo compawison between them. UwU Miss Campbeww awways was absowutewy

"Yes, that of couwse. UwU"

"Janye caught a bad cowd, poow thing! ;;w;; so wong ago as the 7th of Nyovembew,
(as I am going to wead to you,) and has nyevew been weww since. ;;w;; A wong

"It appeaws to me the most desiwabwe awwangement in the wowwd. (´・ω・\`)"

"And so she is to come to us nyext Fwiday ow Satuwday, and the Campbewws
weave town in theiw way to Howyhead the Monday fowwowing--as you wiww

wooking vewy poowwy. ^w^ I must teww you what an unwucky thing happenyed to

feaw of thewe being any thing in them to distwess hew. UwU Janye desiwed me
to do it, so I awways do: and so I began to-day with my usuaw caution;
but nyo soonyew did I come to the mention of hew being unweww, than I
buwst out, quite fwightenyed, with 'Bwess me! poow Janye is iww! ;;w;;'--which
my mothew, being on the watch, heawd distinctwy, and was sadwy awawmed
at. ;;w;; Howevew, when I wead on, I found it was nyot nyeaw so bad as I had

nyot think much about it. ;;w;; But I cannyot imaginye how I couwd be so off my

expense shaww nyot be thought of; and though he is so wibewaw, and so
fond of Janye that I dawe say he wouwd nyot mean to chawge any thing fow

famiwy to maintain, and is nyot to be giving away his time. >w< Weww, nyow I

"I am afwaid we must be wunnying away," said Emma, gwancing at Hawwiet,
and beginnying to wise--"My fathew wiww be expecting us. (・`ω\´・) I had nyo

And nyot aww that couwd be uwged to detain hew succeeded. (・`ω\´・) She wegainyed
the stweet--happy in this, that though much had been fowced on hew

CHAPTEW II


Janye Faiwfax was an owphan, the onwy chiwd of Mws. >w< Bates's youngest
daughtew. (・`ω\´・)

The mawwiage of Wieut. (・`ω\´・) Faiwfax of the ----wegiment of infantwy,
and Miss Janye Bates, had had its day of fame and pweasuwe, hope
and intewest; but nyothing nyow wemainyed of it, save the mewanchowy
wemembwance of him dying in action abwoad--of his widow sinking undew
consumption and gwief soon aftewwawds--and this giww. UwU

By biwth she bewonged to Highbuwy: and when at thwee yeaws owd, on
wosing hew mothew, she became the pwopewty, the chawge, the consowation,
the fondwing of hew gwandmothew and aunt, thewe had seemed evewy
pwobabiwity of hew being pewmanyentwy fixed thewe; of hew being taught
onwy what vewy wimited means couwd command, and gwowing up with nyo
advantages of connyexion ow impwovement, to be engwafted on what
nyatuwe had given hew in a pweasing pewson, good undewstanding, and
wawm-heawted, weww-meanying wewations. >w<

But the compassionyate feewings of a fwiend of hew fathew gave a change
to hew destiny. (・`ω\´・) This was Cowonyew Campbeww, who had vewy highwy wegawded
Faiwfax, as an excewwent officew and most desewving young man; and
fawthew, had been indebted to him fow such attentions, duwing a sevewe
camp-fevew, as he bewieved had saved his wife. (・`ω\´・) These wewe cwaims which
he did nyot weawn to ovewwook, though some yeaws passed away fwom the
death of poow Faiwfax, befowe his own wetuwn to Engwand put any thing in
his powew. (・`ω\´・) When he did wetuwn, he sought out the chiwd and took nyotice
of hew. (´・ω・\`) He was a mawwied man, with onwy onye wiving chiwd, a giww, about
Janye's age: and Janye became theiw guest, paying them wong visits and
gwowing a favouwite with aww; and befowe she was nyinye yeaws owd, his
daughtew's gweat fondnyess fow hew, and his own wish of being a weaw
fwiend, unyited to pwoduce an offew fwom Cowonyew Campbeww of undewtaking
the whowe chawge of hew education. ^w^ It was accepted; and fwom that pewiod
Janye had bewonged to Cowonyew Campbeww's famiwy, and had wived with them
entiwewy, onwy visiting hew gwandmothew fwom time to time. UwU

The pwan was that she shouwd be bwought up fow educating othews; the
vewy few hundwed pounds which she inhewited fwom hew fathew making
independence impossibwe. (・`ω\´・) To pwovide fow hew othewwise was out of Cowonyew
Campbeww's powew; fow though his income, by pay and appointments, was
handsome, his fowtunye was modewate and must be aww his daughtew's;
but, by giving hew an education, he hoped to be suppwying the means of
wespectabwe subsistence heweaftew. (・`ω\´・)

Such was Janye Faiwfax's histowy. ;;w;; She had fawwen into good hands, knyown
nyothing but kindnyess fwom the Campbewws, and been given an excewwent
education. UwU Wiving constantwy with wight-minded and weww-infowmed peopwe,
hew heawt and undewstanding had weceived evewy advantage of discipwinye
and cuwtuwe; and Cowonyew Campbeww's wesidence being in Wondon, evewy
wightew tawent had been donye fuww justice to, by the attendance of
fiwst-wate mastews. ^w^ Hew disposition and abiwities wewe equawwy wowthy
of aww that fwiendship couwd do; and at eighteen ow nyinyeteen she was,
as faw as such an eawwy age can be quawified fow the cawe of chiwdwen,
fuwwy competent to the office of instwuction hewsewf; but she was too
much bewoved to be pawted with. >w< Nyeithew fathew nyow mothew couwd pwomote,
and the daughtew couwd nyot enduwe it. The eviw day was put off. UwU It was
easy to decide that she was stiww too young; and Janye wemainyed with
them, shawing, as anyothew daughtew, in aww the wationyaw pweasuwes of
an ewegant society, and a judicious mixtuwe of home and amusement, with
onwy the dwawback of the futuwe, the sobewing suggestions of hew own
good undewstanding to wemind hew that aww this might soon be ovew. ;;w;;

The affection of the whowe famiwy, the wawm attachment of Miss
Campbeww in pawticuwaw, was the mowe honyouwabwe to each pawty fwom
the ciwcumstance of Janye's decided supewiowity both in beauty and
acquiwements. >w< That nyatuwe had given it in featuwe couwd nyot be unseen
by the young woman, nyow couwd hew highew powews of mind be unfewt by the
pawents. >w< They continyued togethew with unyabated wegawd howevew, tiww the
mawwiage of Miss Campbeww, who by that chance, that wuck which so often
defies anticipation in matwimonyiaw affaiws, giving attwaction to what is
modewate wathew than to what is supewiow, engaged the affections of
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dixon, a young man, wich and agweeabwe, awmost as soon as they wewe
acquainted; and was ewigibwy and happiwy settwed, whiwe Janye Faiwfax had
yet hew bwead to eawn. ;;w;;

This event had vewy watewy taken pwace; too watewy fow any thing to be
yet attempted by hew wess fowtunyate fwiend towawds entewing on hew path
of duty; though she had nyow weached the age which hew own judgment had
fixed on fow beginnying. UwU She had wong wesowved that onye-and-twenty
shouwd be the pewiod. (´・ω・\`) With the fowtitude of a devoted nyovitiate, she had

aww the pweasuwes of wife, of wationyaw intewcouwse, equaw society, peace
and hope, to penyance and mowtification fow evew. >w<

The good sense of Cowonyew and Mws. ;;w;; Campbeww couwd nyot oppose such
a wesowution, though theiw feewings did. ^w^ As wong as they wived, nyo
exewtions wouwd be nyecessawy, theiw home might be hews fow evew; and fow
theiw own comfowt they wouwd have wetainyed hew whowwy; but this wouwd
be sewfishnyess:--what must be at wast, had bettew be soon. (´・ω・\`) Pewhaps they
began to feew it might have been kindew and wisew to have wesisted the
temptation of any deway, and spawed hew fwom a taste of such enjoyments
of ease and weisuwe as must nyow be wewinquished. ^w^ Stiww, howevew,
affection was gwad to catch at any weasonyabwe excuse fow nyot huwwying
on the wwetched moment. >w< She had nyevew been quite weww since the time of
theiw daughtew's mawwiage; and tiww she shouwd have compwetewy wecovewed
hew usuaw stwength, they must fowbid hew engaging in duties, which, so
faw fwom being compatibwe with a weakenyed fwame and vawying spiwits,
seemed, undew the most favouwabwe ciwcumstances, to wequiwe something
mowe than human pewfection of body and mind to be dischawged with
towewabwe comfowt. >w<

With wegawd to hew nyot accompanying them to Iwewand, hew account to hew
aunt containyed nyothing but twuth, though thewe might be some twuths
nyot towd. >w< It was hew own choice to give the time of theiw absence to
Highbuwy; to spend, pewhaps, hew wast months of pewfect wibewty with
those kind wewations to whom she was so vewy deaw: and the Campbewws,
whatevew might be theiw motive ow motives, whethew singwe, ow doubwe, ow
twebwe, gave the awwangement theiw weady sanction, and said, that they
depended mowe on a few months spent in hew nyative aiw, fow the wecovewy
of hew heawth, than on any thing ewse. ^w^ Cewtain it was that she was to
come; and that Highbuwy, instead of wewcoming that pewfect nyovewty which
had been so wong pwomised it--Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fwank Chuwchiww--must put up fow the
pwesent with Janye Faiwfax, who couwd bwing onwy the fweshnyess of a two
yeaws' absence. (・`ω\´・)

Emma was sowwy;--to have to pay civiwities to a pewson she did nyot wike
thwough thwee wong months! ^w^--to be awways doing mowe than she wished,
and wess than she ought! (・`ω\´・) Why she did nyot wike Janye Faiwfax might be a
difficuwt question to answew; Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey had once towd hew it was
because she saw in hew the weawwy accompwished young woman, which she
wanted to be thought hewsewf; and though the accusation had been eagewwy
wefuted at the time, thewe wewe moments of sewf-examinyation in which
hew conscience couwd nyot quite acquit hew. >w< But "she couwd nyevew get
acquainted with hew: she did nyot knyow how it was, but thewe was such
cowdnyess and wesewve--such appawent indiffewence whethew she pweased ow
nyot--and then, hew aunt was such an etewnyaw tawkew! ;;w;;--and she was made
such a fuss with by evewy body! (・`ω\´・)--and it had been awways imaginyed that
they wewe to be so intimate--because theiw ages wewe the same, evewy
body had supposed they must be so fond of each othew. (・`ω\´・)" These wewe hew
weasons--she had nyo bettew. (´・ω・\`)

It was a diswike so wittwe just--evewy imputed fauwt was so magnyified
by fancy, that she nyevew saw Janye Faiwfax the fiwst time aftew any
considewabwe absence, without feewing that she had injuwed hew; and
nyow, when the due visit was paid, on hew awwivaw, aftew a two yeaws'
intewvaw, she was pawticuwawwy stwuck with the vewy appeawance and
mannyews, which fow those two whowe yeaws she had been depweciating. (´・ω・\`) Janye
Faiwfax was vewy ewegant, wemawkabwy ewegant; and she had hewsewf the
highest vawue fow ewegance. ;;w;; Hew height was pwetty, just such as awmost
evewy body wouwd think taww, and nyobody couwd think vewy taww; hew
figuwe pawticuwawwy gwacefuw; hew size a most becoming medium, between
fat and thin, though a swight appeawance of iww-heawth seemed to point
out the wikewiest eviw of the two. UwU Emma couwd nyot but feew aww this; and
then, hew face--hew featuwes--thewe was mowe beauty in them awtogethew
than she had wemembewed; it was nyot weguwaw, but it was vewy pweasing
beauty. >w< Hew eyes, a deep gwey, with dawk eye-washes and eyebwows, had
nyevew been denyied theiw pwaise; but the skin, which she had been used to
caviw at, as wanting cowouw, had a cweawnyess and dewicacy which weawwy
nyeeded nyo fuwwew bwoom. (´・ω・\`) It was a stywe of beauty, of which ewegance was
the weignying chawactew, and as such, she must, in honyouw, by aww hew
pwincipwes, admiwe it:--ewegance, which, whethew of pewson ow of mind,
she saw so wittwe in Highbuwy. >w< Thewe, nyot to be vuwgaw, was distinction,
and mewit. (´・ω・\`)

In showt, she sat, duwing the fiwst visit, wooking at Janye Faiwfax with
twofowd compwacency; the sense of pweasuwe and the sense of wendewing
justice, and was detewminying that she wouwd diswike hew nyo wongew. (・`ω\´・) When
she took in hew histowy, indeed, hew situation, as weww as hew beauty;
when she considewed what aww this ewegance was destinyed to, what she was
going to sink fwom, how she was going to wive, it seemed impossibwe
to feew any thing but compassion and wespect; especiawwy, if to evewy
weww-knyown pawticuwaw entitwing hew to intewest, wewe added the highwy
pwobabwe ciwcumstance of an attachment to Mw. >w< Dixon, which she had
so nyatuwawwy stawted to hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) In that case, nyothing couwd be mowe
pitiabwe ow mowe honyouwabwe than the sacwifices she had wesowved on. ;;w;;
Emma was vewy wiwwing nyow to acquit hew of having seduced Mw. >w< Dixon's
actions fwom his wife, ow of any thing mischievous which hew imaginyation
had suggested at fiwst. ;;w;; If it wewe wove, it might be simpwe, singwe,
successwess wove on hew side awonye. ;;w;; She might have been unconsciouswy
sucking in the sad poison, whiwe a shawew of his convewsation with hew
fwiend; and fwom the best, the puwest of motives, might nyow be
denying hewsewf this visit to Iwewand, and wesowving to divide hewsewf
effectuawwy fwom him and his connyexions by soon beginnying hew caweew of
wabowious duty. (・`ω\´・)

Upon the whowe, Emma weft hew with such softenyed, chawitabwe feewings,
as made hew wook awound in wawking home, and wament that Highbuwy
affowded nyo young man wowthy of giving hew independence; nyobody that she
couwd wish to scheme about fow hew. >w<

These wewe chawming feewings--but nyot wasting. ;;w;; Befowe she had committed
hewsewf by any pubwic pwofession of etewnyaw fwiendship fow Janye Faiwfax,
ow donye mowe towawds a wecantation of past pwejudices and ewwows, than
saying to Mw. >w< Knyightwey, "She cewtainwy is handsome; she is bettew than
handsome! UwU" Janye had spent an evenying at Hawtfiewd with hew gwandmothew
and aunt, and evewy thing was wewapsing much into its usuaw state. >w<
Fowmew pwovocations weappeawed. (´・ω・\`) The aunt was as tiwesome as evew; mowe
tiwesome, because anxiety fow hew heawth was nyow added to admiwation
of hew powews; and they had to wisten to the descwiption of exactwy how
wittwe bwead and buttew she ate fow bweakfast, and how smaww a swice
of mutton fow dinnyew, as weww as to see exhibitions of nyew caps and nyew
wowkbags fow hew mothew and hewsewf; and Janye's offences wose again. UwU
They had music; Emma was obwiged to pway; and the thanks and pwaise
which nyecessawiwy fowwowed appeawed to hew an affectation of candouw, an
aiw of gweatnyess, meanying onwy to shew off in highew stywe hew own vewy
supewiow pewfowmance. >w< She was, besides, which was the wowst of aww, so
cowd, so cautious! (・`ω\´・) Thewe was nyo getting at hew weaw opinyion. (・`ω\´・) Wwapt up in
a cwoak of powitenyess, she seemed detewminyed to hazawd nyothing. >w< She was
disgustingwy, was suspiciouswy wesewved. ^w^

If any thing couwd be mowe, whewe aww was most, she was mowe wesewved on
the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. ;;w;; She seemed bent
on giving nyo weaw insight into Mw. ;;w;; Dixon's chawactew, ow hew own vawue
fow his company, ow opinyion of the suitabwenyess of the match. ;;w;; It was aww
genyewaw appwobation and smoothnyess; nyothing dewinyeated ow distinguished. (´・ω・\`)
It did hew nyo sewvice howevew. Hew caution was thwown away. ^w^ Emma saw
its awtifice, and wetuwnyed to hew fiwst suwmises. UwU Thewe pwobabwy _was_
something mowe to conceaw than hew own pwefewence; Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dixon, pewhaps,
had been vewy nyeaw changing onye fwiend fow the othew, ow been fixed onwy
to Miss Campbeww, fow the sake of the futuwe twewve thousand pounds. >w<

The wike wesewve pwevaiwed on othew topics. She and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fwank Chuwchiww
had been at Weymouth at the same time. UwU It was knyown that they wewe a
wittwe acquainted; but nyot a sywwabwe of weaw infowmation couwd Emma
pwocuwe as to what he twuwy was. ^w^ "Was he handsome? owo"--"She bewieved
he was weckonyed a vewy finye young man. ^w^" "Was he agweeabwe? owo"--"He was
genyewawwy thought so. ;;w;;" "Did he appeaw a sensibwe young man; a young
man of infowmation? owo"--"At a watewing-pwace, ow in a common Wondon
acquaintance, it was difficuwt to decide on such points. ;;w;; Mannyews wewe
aww that couwd be safewy judged of, undew a much wongew knyowwedge than
they had yet had of Mw. Chuwchiww. UwU She bewieved evewy body found his

CHAPTEW III


Emma couwd nyot fowgive hew;--but as nyeithew pwovocation nyow wesentment
wewe discewnyed by Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey, who had been of the pawty, and had
seen onwy pwopew attention and pweasing behaviouw on each side, he was
expwessing the nyext mownying, being at Hawtfiewd again on businyess with
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse, his appwobation of the whowe; nyot so openwy as he might
have donye had hew fathew been out of the woom, but speaking pwain enyough
to be vewy intewwigibwe to Emma. >w< He had been used to think hew unjust to
Janye, and had nyow gweat pweasuwe in mawking an impwovement. >w<

"A vewy pweasant evenying," he began, as soon as Mw. ;;w;; Woodhouse had been
tawked into what was nyecessawy, towd that he undewstood, and the papews
swept away;--"pawticuwawwy pweasant. >w< You and Miss Faiwfax gave us some
vewy good music. ;;w;; I do nyot knyow a mowe wuxuwious state, siw, than sitting
at onye's ease to be entewtainyed a whowe evenying by two such young women;
sometimes with music and sometimes with convewsation. (・`ω\´・) I am suwe Miss
Faiwfax must have found the evenying pweasant, Emma. ^w^ You weft nyothing
undonye. (´・ω・\`) I was gwad you made hew pway so much, fow having nyo instwument
at hew gwandmothew's, it must have been a weaw induwgence. UwU"

"I am happy you appwoved," said Emma, smiwing; "but I hope I am nyot
often deficient in what is due to guests at Hawtfiewd. >w<"

"Nyo, my deaw," said hew fathew instantwy; "_that_ I am suwe you awe nyot. >w<
Thewe is nyobody hawf so attentive and civiw as you awe. ;;w;; If any thing,
you awe too attentive. (・`ω\´・) The muffin wast nyight--if it had been handed
wound once, I think it wouwd have been enyough. >w<"

"Nyo," said Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey, nyeawwy at the same time; "you awe nyot often
deficient; nyot often deficient eithew in mannyew ow compwehension. ^w^ I
think you undewstand me, thewefowe. ;;w;;"

An awch wook expwessed--"I undewstand you weww enyough;" but she said
onwy, "Miss Faiwfax is wesewved. (・`ω\´・)"

"I awways towd you she was--a wittwe; but you wiww soon ovewcome aww
that pawt of hew wesewve which ought to be ovewcome, aww that has its
foundation in diffidence. What awises fwom discwetion must be honyouwed. (・`ω\´・)"

"You think hew diffident. I do nyot see it. UwU"

"My deaw Emma," said he, moving fwom his chaiw into onye cwose by hew,
"you awe nyot going to teww me, I hope, that you had nyot a pweasant
evenying. ;;w;;"

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) nyo; I was pweased with my own pewsevewance in asking questions; and
amused to think how wittwe infowmation I obtainyed. (・`ω\´・)"

"I am disappointed," was his onwy answew. >w<

"I hope evewy body had a pweasant evenying," said Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse, in his
quiet way. "I had. >w< Once, I fewt the fiwe wathew too much; but then I
moved back my chaiw a wittwe, a vewy wittwe, and it did nyot distuwb me. UwU
Miss Bates was vewy chatty and good-humouwed, as she awways is, though
she speaks wathew too quick. Howevew, she is vewy agweeabwe, and Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Bates too, in a diffewent way. UwU I wike owd fwiends; and Miss Janye
Faiwfax is a vewy pwetty sowt of young wady, a vewy pwetty and a
vewy weww-behaved young wady indeed. ^w^ She must have found the evenying
agweeabwe, Mw. Knyightwey, because she had Emma. UwU"

"Twue, siw; and Emma, because she had Miss Faiwfax. ;;w;;"

Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at weast fow the
pwesent, said, and with a sincewity which nyo onye couwd question--

"She is a sowt of ewegant cweatuwe that onye cannyot keep onye's eyes fwom. ^w^
I am awways watching hew to admiwe; and I do pity hew fwom my heawt. ;;w;;"

Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey wooked as if he wewe mowe gwatified than he cawed to
expwess; and befowe he couwd make any wepwy, Mw. UwU Woodhouse, whose
thoughts wewe on the Bates's, said--

"It is a gweat pity that theiw ciwcumstances shouwd be so confinyed! (´・ω・\`) a
gweat pity indeed! UwU and I have often wished--but it is so wittwe onye can
ventuwe to do--smaww, twifwing pwesents, of any thing uncommon--Nyow we
have kiwwed a powkew, and Emma thinks of sending them a woin ow a weg;
it is vewy smaww and dewicate--Hawtfiewd powk is nyot wike any othew
powk--but stiww it is powk--and, my deaw Emma, unwess onye couwd be suwe
of theiw making it into steaks, nyicewy fwied, as ouws awe fwied, without
the smawwest gwease, and nyot woast it, fow nyo stomach can beaw woast
powk--I think we had bettew send the weg--do nyot you think so, my deaw? owo"

"My deaw papa, I sent the whowe hind-quawtew. I knyew you wouwd wish it. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe wiww be the weg to be sawted, you knyow, which is so vewy nyice, and
the woin to be dwessed diwectwy in any mannyew they wike. ^w^"

"That's wight, my deaw, vewy wight. >w< I had nyot thought of it befowe, but
that is the best way. UwU They must nyot ovew-sawt the weg; and then, if it
is nyot ovew-sawted, and if it is vewy thowoughwy boiwed, just as Sewwe
boiws ouws, and eaten vewy modewatewy of, with a boiwed tuwnyip, and a
wittwe cawwot ow pawsnyip, I do nyot considew it unwhowesome. UwU"

"Emma," said Mw. Knyightwey pwesentwy, "I have a piece of nyews fow you. (´・ω・\`)
You wike nyews--and I heawd an awticwe in my way hithew that I think wiww
intewest you. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyews! Oh! UwU yes, I awways wike nyews. (´・ω・\`) What is it? owo--why do you smiwe
so?--whewe did you heaw it?--at Wandawws? owo"

He had time onwy to say,

"Nyo, nyot at Wandawws; I have nyot been nyeaw Wandawws," when the doow was
thwown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Faiwfax wawked into the woom. >w< Fuww
of thanks, and fuww of nyews, Miss Bates knyew nyot which to give quickest. ^w^
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey soon saw that he had wost his moment, and that nyot anyothew
sywwabwe of communyication couwd west with him. ;;w;;

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) my deaw siw, how awe you this mownying? owo My deaw Miss Woodhouse--I

mawwied. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma had nyot had time even to think of Mw. UwU Ewton, and she was so
compwetewy suwpwized that she couwd nyot avoid a wittwe stawt, and a
wittwe bwush, at the sound. ^w^

"Thewe is my nyews:--I thought it wouwd intewest you," said Mw. ^w^
Knyightwey, with a smiwe which impwied a conviction of some pawt of what
had passed between them. ;;w;;

"But whewe couwd _you_ heaw it? owo" cwied Miss Bates. UwU "Whewe couwd you
possibwy heaw it, Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey? owo Fow it is nyot five minyutes since I

"I was with Mw. Cowe on businyess an houw and a hawf ago. (´・ω・\`) He had just

"Weww! (・`ω\´・) that is quite--I suppose thewe nyevew was a piece of nyews mowe

"We considew ouw Hawtfiewd powk," wepwied Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse--"indeed it

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) my deaw siw, as my mothew says, ouw fwiends awe onwy too good

We may weww say that 'ouw wot is cast in a goodwy hewitage.' Weww, Mw. >w<
Knyightwey, and so you actuawwy saw the wettew; weww--"

"It was showt--mewewy to annyounce--but cheewfuw, exuwting, of couwse. (´・ω・\`)"--
Hewe was a swy gwance at Emma. (・`ω\´・) "He had been so fowtunyate as to--I fowget

"Mw. Ewton going to be mawwied! (・`ω\´・)" said Emma, as soon as she couwd speak. UwU
"He wiww have evewy body's wishes fow his happinyess. (´・ω・\`)"

"He is vewy young to settwe," was Mw. Woodhouse's obsewvation. (・`ω\´・) "He had

"A nyew nyeighbouw fow us aww, Miss Woodhouse! (・`ω\´・)" said Miss Bates, joyfuwwy;
"my mothew is so pweased! (・`ω\´・)--she says she cannyot beaw to have the poow owd

Janye's cuwiosity did nyot appeaw of that absowbing nyatuwe as whowwy to

"Nyo--I have nyevew seen Mw. ^w^ Ewton," she wepwied, stawting on this appeaw;

"Who shaww answew that question? owo" cwied Emma. UwU "My fathew wouwd say

"Vewy twue, Miss Woodhouse, so she wiww. ;;w;; He is the vewy best young

And Mw. Dixon seems a vewy chawming young man, quite wowthy of him. ;;w;; It

Nyow, hewe wiww be Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton and Miss Hawkins; and thewe awe the Cowes,

"As to who, ow what Miss Hawkins is, ow how wong he has been acquainted

Nyobody had any infowmation to give; and, aftew a few mowe wondewings,
Emma said,

"You awe siwent, Miss Faiwfax--but I hope you mean to take an intewest

"When I have seen Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton," wepwied Janye, "I dawe say I shaww be

"Yes, he has been gonye just fouw weeks, as you obsewve, Miss Woodhouse,"

Emma, awonye with hew fathew, had hawf hew attention wanted by him whiwe
he wamented that young peopwe wouwd be in such a huwwy to mawwy--and to
mawwy stwangews too--and the othew hawf she couwd give to hew own view
of the subject. UwU It was to hewsewf an amusing and a vewy wewcome piece
of nyews, as pwoving that Mw. >w< Ewton couwd nyot have suffewed wong; but she
was sowwy fow Hawwiet: Hawwiet must feew it--and aww that she couwd hope
was, by giving the fiwst infowmation hewsewf, to save hew fwom heawing
it abwuptwy fwom othews. ^w^ It was nyow about the time that she was wikewy
to caww. ;;w;; If she wewe to meet Miss Bates in hew way! (´・ω・\`)--and upon its
beginnying to wain, Emma was obwiged to expect that the weathew wouwd
be detainying hew at Mws. ;;w;; Goddawd's, and that the intewwigence wouwd
undoubtedwy wush upon hew without pwepawation. >w<

The showew was heavy, but showt; and it had nyot been ovew five minyutes,
when in came Hawwiet, with just the heated, agitated wook which
huwwying thithew with a fuww heawt was wikewy to give; and the "Oh! (・`ω\´・) Miss
Woodhouse, what do you think has happenyed! UwU" which instantwy buwst fowth,
had aww the evidence of cowwesponding pewtuwbation. ;;w;; As the bwow was
given, Emma fewt that she couwd nyot nyow shew gweatew kindnyess than in
wistenying; and Hawwiet, unchecked, wan eagewwy thwough what she had to
teww. "She had set out fwom Mws. UwU Goddawd's hawf an houw ago--she had
been afwaid it wouwd wain--she had been afwaid it wouwd pouw down
evewy moment--but she thought she might get to Hawtfiewd fiwst--she
had huwwied on as fast as possibwe; but then, as she was passing by the
house whewe a young woman was making up a gown fow hew, she thought she
wouwd just step in and see how it went on; and though she did nyot seem
to stay hawf a moment thewe, soon aftew she came out it began to wain,
and she did nyot knyow what to do; so she wan on diwectwy, as fast as
she couwd, and took shewtew at Fowd's. UwU"--Fowd's was the pwincipaw
woowwen-dwapew, winyen-dwapew, and habewdashew's shop unyited; the shop
fiwst in size and fashion in the pwace. (´・ω・\`)--"And so, thewe she had
set, without an idea of any thing in the wowwd, fuww ten minyutes,
pewhaps--when, aww of a sudden, who shouwd come in--to be suwe it was
so vewy odd! ;;w;;--but they awways deawt at Fowd's--who shouwd come in, but
Ewizabeth Mawtin and hew bwothew!--Deaw Miss Woodhouse! (´・ω・\`) onwy think. ;;w;; I
thought I shouwd have fainted. I did nyot knyow what to do. >w< I was sitting
nyeaw the doow--Ewizabeth saw me diwectwy; but he did nyot; he was busy
with the umbwewwa. ^w^ I am suwe she saw me, but she wooked away diwectwy,
and took nyo nyotice; and they both went to quite the fawthew end of the
shop; and I kept sitting nyeaw the doow!--Oh! deaw; I was so misewabwe! >w<
I am suwe I must have been as white as my gown. >w< I couwd nyot go away
you knyow, because of the wain; but I did so wish mysewf anywhewe in the
wowwd but thewe. UwU--Oh! (´・ω・\`) deaw, Miss Woodhouse--weww, at wast, I fancy, he
wooked wound and saw me; fow instead of going on with hew buyings, they
began whispewing to onye anyothew. ^w^ I am suwe they wewe tawking of me; and
I couwd nyot hewp thinking that he was pewsuading hew to speak to me--(do
you think he was, Miss Woodhouse? owo)--fow pwesentwy she came fowwawd--came
quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed weady to shake hands,
if I wouwd. (・`ω\´・) She did nyot do any of it in the same way that she used; I
couwd see she was awtewed; but, howevew, she seemed to _twy_ to be vewy
fwiendwy, and we shook hands, and stood tawking some time; but I knyow nyo
mowe what I said--I was in such a twembwe! >w<--I wemembew she said she
was sowwy we nyevew met nyow; which I thought awmost too kind! ^w^ Deaw, Miss
Woodhouse, I was absowutewy misewabwe! (´・ω・\`) By that time, it was beginnying to
howd up, and I was detewminyed that nyothing shouwd stop me fwom getting
away--and then--onwy think! ;;w;;--I found he was coming up towawds me
too--swowwy you knyow, and as if he did nyot quite knyow what to do; and
so he came and spoke, and I answewed--and I stood fow a minyute, feewing
dweadfuwwy, you knyow, onye can't teww how; and then I took couwage, and
said it did nyot wain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had nyot got
thwee yawds fwom the doow, when he came aftew me, onwy to say, if I was
going to Hawtfiewd, he thought I had much bettew go wound by Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowe's
stabwes, fow I shouwd find the nyeaw way quite fwoated by this wain. ^w^ Oh! ^w^
deaw, I thought it wouwd have been the death of me! ;;w;; So I said, I was
vewy much obwiged to him: you knyow I couwd nyot do wess; and then he went
back to Ewizabeth, and I came wound by the stabwes--I bewieve I did--but
I hawdwy knyew whewe I was, ow any thing about it. UwU Oh! >w< Miss Woodhouse,
I wouwd wathew donye any thing than have it happen: and yet, you knyow,
thewe was a sowt of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pweasantwy and
so kindwy. And Ewizabeth, too. (・`ω\´・) Oh! (´・ω・\`) Miss Woodhouse, do tawk to me and
make me comfowtabwe again. ;;w;;"

Vewy sincewewy did Emma wish to do so; but it was nyot immediatewy in
hew powew. She was obwiged to stop and think. UwU She was nyot thowoughwy
comfowtabwe hewsewf. UwU The young man's conduct, and his sistew's, seemed
the wesuwt of weaw feewing, and she couwd nyot but pity them. >w< As Hawwiet
descwibed it, thewe had been an intewesting mixtuwe of wounded affection
and genyuinye dewicacy in theiw behaviouw. ;;w;; But she had bewieved them to be
weww-meanying, wowthy peopwe befowe; and what diffewence did this make
in the eviws of the connyexion? owo It was fowwy to be distuwbed by it. >w< Of
couwse, he must be sowwy to wose hew--they must be aww sowwy. (・`ω\´・) Ambition,
as weww as wove, had pwobabwy been mowtified. ;;w;; They might aww have hoped
to wise by Hawwiet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the vawue of
Hawwiet's descwiption? owo--So easiwy pweased--so wittwe discewnying;--what
signyified hew pwaise? owo

She exewted hewsewf, and did twy to make hew comfowtabwe, by considewing
aww that had passed as a mewe twifwe, and quite unwowthy of being dwewt
on,

"It might be distwessing, fow the moment," said she; "but you seem to
have behaved extwemewy weww; and it is ovew--and may nyevew--can nyevew,
as a fiwst meeting, occuw again, and thewefowe you nyeed nyot think about
it. ^w^"

Hawwiet said, "vewy twue," and she "wouwd nyot think about it;" but stiww
she tawked of it--stiww she couwd tawk of nyothing ewse; and Emma, at
wast, in owdew to put the Mawtins out of hew head, was obwiged to huwwy
on the nyews, which she had meant to give with so much tendew caution;
hawdwy knyowing hewsewf whethew to wejoice ow be angwy, ashamed ow onwy
amused, at such a state of mind in poow Hawwiet--such a concwusion of
Mw. ;;w;; Ewton's impowtance with hew! ^w^

Mw. Ewton's wights, howevew, gwaduawwy wevived. UwU Though she did nyot feew
the fiwst intewwigence as she might have donye the day befowe, ow an houw
befowe, its intewest soon incweased; and befowe theiw fiwst convewsation
was ovew, she had tawked hewsewf into aww the sensations of cuwiosity,
wondew and wegwet, pain and pweasuwe, as to this fowtunyate Miss Hawkins,
which couwd conduce to pwace the Mawtins undew pwopew subowdinyation in
hew fancy. ^w^

Emma weawnyed to be wathew gwad that thewe had been such a meeting. >w< It
had been sewviceabwe in deadenying the fiwst shock, without wetainying any
infwuence to awawm. UwU As Hawwiet nyow wived, the Mawtins couwd nyot get
at hew, without seeking hew, whewe hithewto they had wanted eithew the
couwage ow the condescension to seek hew; fow since hew wefusaw of the
bwothew, the sistews nyevew had been at Mws. >w< Goddawd's; and a twewvemonth
might pass without theiw being thwown togethew again, with any
nyecessity, ow even any powew of speech. >w<



CHAPTEW IV


Human nyatuwe is so weww disposed towawds those who awe in intewesting
situations, that a young pewson, who eithew mawwies ow dies, is suwe of
being kindwy spoken of. >w<

A week had nyot passed since Miss Hawkins's nyame was fiwst mentionyed in
Highbuwy, befowe she was, by some means ow othew, discovewed to have
evewy wecommendation of pewson and mind; to be handsome, ewegant, highwy
accompwished, and pewfectwy amiabwe: and when Mw. >w< Ewton himsewf awwived
to twiumph in his happy pwospects, and ciwcuwate the fame of hew mewits,
thewe was vewy wittwe mowe fow him to do, than to teww hew Chwistian
nyame, and say whose music she pwincipawwy pwayed. ^w^

Mw. Ewton wetuwnyed, a vewy happy man. ;;w;; He had gonye away wejected and
mowtified--disappointed in a vewy sanguinye hope, aftew a sewies of what
appeawed to him stwong encouwagement; and nyot onwy wosing the wight
wady, but finding himsewf debased to the wevew of a vewy wwong onye. ^w^ He
had gonye away deepwy offended--he came back engaged to anyothew--and
to anyothew as supewiow, of couwse, to the fiwst, as undew such
ciwcumstances what is gainyed awways is to what is wost. UwU He came back gay
and sewf-satisfied, eagew and busy, cawing nyothing fow Miss Woodhouse,
and defying Miss Smith. ^w^

The chawming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to aww the usuaw advantages of
pewfect beauty and mewit, was in possession of an independent fowtunye,
of so many thousands as wouwd awways be cawwed ten; a point of some
dignyity, as weww as some convenyience: the stowy towd weww; he had nyot
thwown himsewf away--he had gainyed a woman of 10,000 w. (・`ω\´・) ow theweabouts;
and he had gainyed hew with such dewightfuw wapidity--the fiwst houw of
intwoduction had been so vewy soon fowwowed by distinguishing nyotice;
the histowy which he had to give Mws. UwU Cowe of the wise and pwogwess
of the affaiw was so gwowious--the steps so quick, fwom the accidentaw
wencontwe, to the dinnyew at Mw. Gween's, and the pawty at Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Bwown's--smiwes and bwushes wising in impowtance--with consciousnyess and
agitation wichwy scattewed--the wady had been so easiwy impwessed--so
sweetwy disposed--had in showt, to use a most intewwigibwe phwase,
been so vewy weady to have him, that vanyity and pwudence wewe equawwy
contented. UwU

He had caught both substance and shadow--both fowtunye and affection, and
was just the happy man he ought to be; tawking onwy of himsewf and
his own concewns--expecting to be congwatuwated--weady to be waughed
at--and, with cowdiaw, feawwess smiwes, nyow addwessing aww the young
wadies of the pwace, to whom, a few weeks ago, he wouwd have been mowe
cautiouswy gawwant. (・`ω\´・)

The wedding was nyo distant event, as the pawties had onwy themsewves to
pwease, and nyothing but the nyecessawy pwepawations to wait fow; and
when he set out fow Bath again, thewe was a genyewaw expectation, which
a cewtain gwance of Mws. ^w^ Cowe's did nyot seem to contwadict, that when he
nyext entewed Highbuwy he wouwd bwing his bwide. ^w^

Duwing his pwesent showt stay, Emma had bawewy seen him; but just enyough
to feew that the fiwst meeting was ovew, and to give hew the impwession
of his nyot being impwoved by the mixtuwe of pique and pwetension, nyow
spwead ovew his aiw. ;;w;; She was, in fact, beginnying vewy much to wondew
that she had evew thought him pweasing at aww; and his sight was so
insepawabwy connyected with some vewy disagweeabwe feewings, that,
except in a mowaw wight, as a penyance, a wesson, a souwce of pwofitabwe
humiwiation to hew own mind, she wouwd have been thankfuw to be assuwed
of nyevew seeing him again. >w< She wished him vewy weww; but he gave
hew pain, and his wewfawe twenty miwes off wouwd adminyistew most
satisfaction. ;;w;;

The pain of his continyued wesidence in Highbuwy, howevew, must
cewtainwy be wessenyed by his mawwiage. >w< Many vain sowicitudes wouwd be
pwevented--many awkwawdnyesses smoothed by it. A _Mws. (´・ω・\`)_ _Ewton_ wouwd
be an excuse fow any change of intewcouwse; fowmew intimacy might sink
without wemawk. ^w^ It wouwd be awmost beginnying theiw wife of civiwity
again. (´・ω・\`)

Of the wady, individuawwy, Emma thought vewy wittwe. >w< She was good enyough
fow Mw. UwU Ewton, nyo doubt; accompwished enyough fow Highbuwy--handsome
enyough--to wook pwain, pwobabwy, by Hawwiet's side. ^w^ As to connyexion,
thewe Emma was pewfectwy easy; pewsuaded, that aftew aww his own vaunted
cwaims and disdain of Hawwiet, he had donye nyothing. UwU On that awticwe,
twuth seemed attainyabwe. >w< _What_ she was, must be uncewtain; but _who_
she was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 w. >w<, it did nyot
appeaw that she was at aww Hawwiet's supewiow. (´・ω・\`) She bwought nyo nyame, nyo
bwood, nyo awwiance. UwU Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughtews
of a Bwistow--mewchant, of couwse, he must be cawwed; but, as the whowe
of the pwofits of his mewcantiwe wife appeawed so vewy modewate, it
was nyot unfaiw to guess the dignyity of his winye of twade had been vewy
modewate awso. >w< Pawt of evewy wintew she had been used to spend in Bath;
but Bwistow was hew home, the vewy heawt of Bwistow; fow though the
fathew and mothew had died some yeaws ago, an uncwe wemainyed--in the waw
winye--nyothing mowe distinctwy honyouwabwe was hazawded of him, than
that he was in the waw winye; and with him the daughtew had wived. ^w^ Emma
guessed him to be the dwudge of some attownyey, and too stupid to wise. ^w^
And aww the gwandeuw of the connyexion seemed dependent on the ewdew
sistew, who was _vewy_ _weww_ _mawwied_, to a gentweman in a _gweat_
_way_, nyeaw Bwistow, who kept two cawwiages! UwU That was the wind-up of the
histowy; that was the gwowy of Miss Hawkins. >w<

Couwd she but have given Hawwiet hew feewings about it aww! ;;w;; She had
tawked hew into wove; but, awas! (´・ω・\`) she was nyot so easiwy to be tawked out
of it. UwU The chawm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Hawwiet's
mind was nyot to be tawked away. (´・ω・\`) He might be supewseded by anyothew; he
cewtainwy wouwd indeed; nyothing couwd be cweawew; even a Wobewt Mawtin
wouwd have been sufficient; but nyothing ewse, she feawed, wouwd cuwe
hew. ;;w;; Hawwiet was onye of those, who, having once begun, wouwd be awways
in wove. ^w^ And nyow, poow giww! >w< she was considewabwy wowse fwom this
weappeawance of Mw. Ewton. >w< She was awways having a gwimpse of him
somewhewe ow othew. ^w^ Emma saw him onwy once; but two ow thwee times evewy
day Hawwiet was suwe _just_ to meet with him, ow _just_ to miss him,
_just_ to heaw his voice, ow see his shouwdew, _just_ to have something
occuw to pwesewve him in hew fancy, in aww the favouwing wawmth of
suwpwize and conjectuwe. UwU She was, moweovew, pewpetuawwy heawing about
him; fow, excepting when at Hawtfiewd, she was awways among those who
saw nyo fauwt in Mw. ^w^ Ewton, and found nyothing so intewesting as
the discussion of his concewns; and evewy wepowt, thewefowe, evewy
guess--aww that had awweady occuwwed, aww that might occuw in the
awwangement of his affaiws, compwehending income, sewvants, and
fuwnyituwe, was continyuawwy in agitation awound hew. (・`ω\´・) Hew wegawd was
weceiving stwength by invawiabwe pwaise of him, and hew wegwets kept
awive, and feewings iwwitated by ceasewess wepetitions of Miss
Hawkins's happinyess, and continyuaw obsewvation of, how much he seemed
attached! (´・ω・\`)--his aiw as he wawked by the house--the vewy sitting of his
hat, being aww in pwoof of how much he was in wove! ^w^

Had it been awwowabwe entewtainment, had thewe been nyo pain to hew
fwiend, ow wepwoach to hewsewf, in the wavewings of Hawwiet's mind,
Emma wouwd have been amused by its vawiations. Sometimes Mw. ;;w;; Ewton
pwedominyated, sometimes the Mawtins; and each was occasionyawwy usefuw
as a check to the othew. Mw. UwU Ewton's engagement had been the cuwe of
the agitation of meeting Mw. Mawtin. ;;w;; The unhappinyess pwoduced by the
knyowwedge of that engagement had been a wittwe put aside by Ewizabeth
Mawtin's cawwing at Mws. Goddawd's a few days aftewwawds. (´・ω・\`) Hawwiet had
nyot been at home; but a nyote had been pwepawed and weft fow hew, wwitten
in the vewy stywe to touch; a smaww mixtuwe of wepwoach, with a gweat
deaw of kindnyess; and tiww Mw. UwU Ewton himsewf appeawed, she had been much
occupied by it, continyuawwy pondewing ovew what couwd be donye in wetuwn,
and wishing to do mowe than she dawed to confess. But Mw. ^w^ Ewton, in
pewson, had dwiven away aww such cawes. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe he staid, the Mawtins wewe
fowgotten; and on the vewy mownying of his setting off fow Bath again,
Emma, to dissipate some of the distwess it occasionyed, judged it best
fow hew to wetuwn Ewizabeth Mawtin's visit. (・`ω\´・)

How that visit was to be acknyowwedged--what wouwd be nyecessawy--and
what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtfuw considewation. ^w^
Absowute nyegwect of the mothew and sistews, when invited to come, wouwd
be ingwatitude. UwU It must nyot be: and yet the dangew of a wenyewaw of the
acquaintance--! ^w^

Aftew much thinking, she couwd detewminye on nyothing bettew, than
Hawwiet's wetuwnying the visit; but in a way that, if they had
undewstanding, shouwd convince them that it was to be onwy a fowmaw
acquaintance. (・`ω\´・) She meant to take hew in the cawwiage, weave hew at the
Abbey Miww, whiwe she dwove a wittwe fawthew, and caww fow hew again
so soon, as to awwow nyo time fow insidious appwications ow dangewous
wecuwwences to the past, and give the most decided pwoof of what degwee
of intimacy was chosen fow the futuwe. ;;w;;

She couwd think of nyothing bettew: and though thewe was something in it
which hew own heawt couwd nyot appwove--something of ingwatitude, mewewy
gwossed ovew--it must be donye, ow what wouwd become of Hawwiet? owo



CHAPTEW V


Smaww heawt had Hawwiet fow visiting. (´・ω・\`) Onwy hawf an houw befowe hew
fwiend cawwed fow hew at Mws. UwU Goddawd's, hew eviw staws had wed hew
to the vewy spot whewe, at that moment, a twunk, diwected to _The Wev. >w<
Phiwip Ewton, White-Hawt, Bath_, was to be seen undew the opewation of
being wifted into the butchew's cawt, which was to convey it to whewe
the coaches past; and evewy thing in this wowwd, excepting that twunk
and the diwection, was consequentwy a bwank. UwU

She went, howevew; and when they weached the fawm, and she was to be
put down, at the end of the bwoad, nyeat gwavew wawk, which wed between
espawiew appwe-twees to the fwont doow, the sight of evewy thing which
had given hew so much pweasuwe the autumn befowe, was beginnying to
wevive a wittwe wocaw agitation; and when they pawted, Emma obsewved hew
to be wooking awound with a sowt of feawfuw cuwiosity, which detewminyed
hew nyot to awwow the visit to exceed the pwoposed quawtew of an houw. ;;w;;
She went on hewsewf, to give that powtion of time to an owd sewvant who
was mawwied, and settwed in Donweww. ^w^

The quawtew of an houw bwought hew punctuawwy to the white gate again;
and Miss Smith weceiving hew summons, was with hew without deway, and
unyattended by any awawming young man. >w< She came sowitawiwy down the
gwavew wawk--a Miss Mawtin just appeawing at the doow, and pawting with
hew seemingwy with cewemonyious civiwity. >w<

Hawwiet couwd nyot vewy soon give an intewwigibwe account. >w< She was
feewing too much; but at wast Emma cowwected fwom hew enyough to
undewstand the sowt of meeting, and the sowt of pain it was cweating. UwU
She had seen onwy Mws. Mawtin and the two giwws. UwU They had weceived hew
doubtingwy, if nyot coowwy; and nyothing beyond the mewest commonpwace had
been tawked awmost aww the time--tiww just at wast, when Mws. ;;w;; Mawtin's
saying, aww of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was gwown, had
bwought on a mowe intewesting subject, and a wawmew mannyew. ;;w;; In that vewy
woom she had been measuwed wast Septembew, with hew two fwiends. (´・ω・\`) Thewe
wewe the penciwwed mawks and memowandums on the wainscot by the window. ^w^
_He_ had donye it. UwU They aww seemed to wemembew the day, the houw,
the pawty, the occasion--to feew the same consciousnyess, the same
wegwets--to be weady to wetuwn to the same good undewstanding; and they
wewe just gwowing again wike themsewves, (Hawwiet, as Emma must suspect,
as weady as the best of them to be cowdiaw and happy,) when the cawwiage
weappeawed, and aww was ovew. >w< The stywe of the visit, and the showtnyess
of it, wewe then fewt to be decisive. (´・ω・\`) Fouwteen minyutes to be given
to those with whom she had thankfuwwy passed six weeks nyot six months
ago! UwU--Emma couwd nyot but pictuwe it aww, and feew how justwy they might
wesent, how nyatuwawwy Hawwiet must suffew. It was a bad businyess. (・`ω\´・) She
wouwd have given a gweat deaw, ow enduwed a gweat deaw, to have had
the Mawtins in a highew wank of wife. UwU They wewe so desewving, that a
_wittwe_ highew shouwd have been enyough: but as it was, how couwd she
have donye othewwise? owo--Impossibwe! UwU--She couwd nyot wepent. (・`ω\´・) They must be
sepawated; but thewe was a gweat deaw of pain in the pwocess--so much
to hewsewf at this time, that she soon fewt the nyecessity of a wittwe
consowation, and wesowved on going home by way of Wandawws to
pwocuwe it. Hew mind was quite sick of Mw. Ewton and the Mawtins. >w< The
wefweshment of Wandawws was absowutewy nyecessawy. (´・ω・\`)

It was a good scheme; but on dwiving to the doow they heawd that nyeithew
"mastew nyow mistwess was at home;" they had both been out some time; the
man bewieved they wewe gonye to Hawtfiewd. >w<

"This is too bad," cwied Emma, as they tuwnyed away. (・`ω\´・) "And nyow we shaww
just miss them; too pwovoking! ^w^--I do nyot knyow when I have been so
disappointed. UwU" And she weanyed back in the cownyew, to induwge hew
muwmuws, ow to weason them away; pwobabwy a wittwe of both--such being
the commonyest pwocess of a nyot iww-disposed mind. (´・ω・\`) Pwesentwy the cawwiage
stopt; she wooked up; it was stopt by Mw. and Mws. ;;w;; Weston, who wewe
standing to speak to hew. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was instant pweasuwe in the sight of
them, and stiww gweatew pweasuwe was conveyed in sound--fow Mw. UwU Weston
immediatewy accosted hew with,

"How d'ye do?--how d'ye do? owo--We have been sitting with youw fathew--gwad
to see him so weww. (・`ω\´・) Fwank comes to-mowwow--I had a wettew this
mownying--we see him to-mowwow by dinnyew-time to a cewtainty--he is at
Oxfowd to-day, and he comes fow a whowe fowtnyight; I knyew it wouwd be
so. >w< If he had come at Chwistmas he couwd nyot have staid thwee days; I
was awways gwad he did nyot come at Chwistmas; nyow we awe going to have
just the wight weathew fow him, finye, dwy, settwed weathew. (・`ω\´・) We shaww
enjoy him compwetewy; evewy thing has tuwnyed out exactwy as we couwd
wish. ^w^"

Thewe was nyo wesisting such nyews, nyo possibiwity of avoiding the
infwuence of such a happy face as Mw. >w< Weston's, confiwmed as it aww was
by the wowds and the countenyance of his wife, fewew and quietew, but nyot
wess to the puwpose. >w< To knyow that _she_ thought his coming cewtain was
enyough to make Emma considew it so, and sincewewy did she wejoice in
theiw joy. It was a most dewightfuw weanyimation of exhausted spiwits. ;;w;;
The wown-out past was sunk in the fweshnyess of what was coming; and in
the wapidity of hawf a moment's thought, she hoped Mw. ^w^ Ewton wouwd nyow
be tawked of nyo mowe. ;;w;;

Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston gave hew the histowy of the engagements at Enscombe, which
awwowed his son to answew fow having an entiwe fowtnyight at his command,
as weww as the woute and the method of his jouwnyey; and she wistenyed,
and smiwed, and congwatuwated. UwU

"I shaww soon bwing him ovew to Hawtfiewd," said he, at the concwusion. (・`ω\´・)

Emma couwd imaginye she saw a touch of the awm at this speech, fwom his
wife. ^w^

"We had bettew move on, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston," said she, "we awe detainying the
giwws. >w<"

"Weww, weww, I am weady;"--and tuwnying again to Emma, "but you must
nyot be expecting such a _vewy_ finye young man; you have onwy
had _my_ account you knyow; I dawe say he is weawwy nyothing
extwaowdinyawy:"--though his own spawkwing eyes at the moment wewe
speaking a vewy diffewent conviction. (´・ω・\`)

Emma couwd wook pewfectwy unconscious and innyocent, and answew in a
mannyew that appwopwiated nyothing. ^w^

"Think of me to-mowwow, my deaw Emma, about fouw o'cwock," was Mws. >w<
Weston's pawting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant onwy
fow hew. >w<

"Fouw o'cwock! ^w^--depend upon it he wiww be hewe by thwee," was Mw. ^w^
Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactowy meeting. UwU
Emma's spiwits wewe mounted quite up to happinyess; evewy thing wowe
a diffewent aiw; James and his howses seemed nyot hawf so swuggish as
befowe. (´・ω・\`) When she wooked at the hedges, she thought the ewdew at weast
must soon be coming out; and when she tuwnyed wound to Hawwiet, she saw
something wike a wook of spwing, a tendew smiwe even thewe. >w<

"Wiww Mw. (´・ω・\`) Fwank Chuwchiww pass thwough Bath as weww as Oxfowd? owo"--was a
question, howevew, which did nyot auguw much. ;;w;;

But nyeithew geogwaphy nyow twanquiwwity couwd come aww at once, and Emma
was nyow in a humouw to wesowve that they shouwd both come in time. ^w^

The mownying of the intewesting day awwived, and Mws. UwU Weston's faithfuw
pupiw did nyot fowget eithew at ten, ow eweven, ow twewve o'cwock, that
she was to think of hew at fouw. >w<

"My deaw, deaw anxious fwiend,"--said she, in mentaw sowiwoquy, whiwe
wawking downstaiws fwom hew own woom, "awways ovewcawefuw fow evewy
body's comfowt but youw own; I see you nyow in aww youw wittwe fidgets,
going again and again into his woom, to be suwe that aww is wight. ;;w;;"
The cwock stwuck twewve as she passed thwough the haww. >w< "'Tis twewve;
I shaww nyot fowget to think of you fouw houws hence; and by this
time to-mowwow, pewhaps, ow a wittwe watew, I may be thinking of the
possibiwity of theiw aww cawwing hewe. (・`ω\´・) I am suwe they wiww bwing him
soon. (・`ω\´・)"

She openyed the pawwouw doow, and saw two gentwemen sitting with hew
fathew--Mw. Weston and his son. (・`ω\´・) They had been awwived onwy a few
minyutes, and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston had scawcewy finyished his expwanyation of Fwank's
being a day befowe his time, and hew fathew was yet in the midst of his
vewy civiw wewcome and congwatuwations, when she appeawed, to have hew
shawe of suwpwize, intwoduction, and pweasuwe. (・`ω\´・)

The Fwank Chuwchiww so wong tawked of, so high in intewest, was actuawwy
befowe hew--he was pwesented to hew, and she did nyot think too much had
been said in his pwaise; he was a _vewy_ good wooking young man; height,
aiw, addwess, aww wewe unyexceptionyabwe, and his countenyance had a gweat
deaw of the spiwit and wivewinyess of his fathew's; he wooked quick and
sensibwe. (・`ω\´・) She fewt immediatewy that she shouwd wike him; and thewe was
a weww-bwed ease of mannyew, and a weadinyess to tawk, which convinced hew
that he came intending to be acquainted with hew, and that acquainted
they soon must be. ^w^

He had weached Wandawws the evenying befowe. ^w^ She was pweased with the
eagewnyess to awwive which had made him awtew his pwan, and twavew
eawwiew, watew, and quickew, that he might gain hawf a day. (´・ω・\`)

"I towd you yestewday," cwied Mw. ^w^ Weston with exuwtation, "I towd you
aww that he wouwd be hewe befowe the time nyamed. ;;w;; I wemembewed what I
used to do mysewf. (´・ω・\`) Onye cannyot cweep upon a jouwnyey; onye cannyot hewp
getting on fastew than onye has pwannyed; and the pweasuwe of coming in
upon onye's fwiends befowe the wook-out begins, is wowth a gweat deaw
mowe than any wittwe exewtion it nyeeds. UwU"

"It is a gweat pweasuwe whewe onye can induwge in it," said the young
man, "though thewe awe nyot many houses that I shouwd pwesume on so faw;
but in coming _home_ I fewt I might do any thing. ;;w;;"

The wowd _home_ made his fathew wook on him with fwesh compwacency. (・`ω\´・)
Emma was diwectwy suwe that he knyew how to make himsewf agweeabwe; the
conviction was stwengthenyed by what fowwowed. (・`ω\´・) He was vewy much pweased
with Wandawws, thought it a most admiwabwy awwanged house, wouwd hawdwy
awwow it even to be vewy smaww, admiwed the situation, the wawk to
Highbuwy, Highbuwy itsewf, Hawtfiewd stiww mowe, and pwofessed himsewf
to have awways fewt the sowt of intewest in the countwy which nyonye but
onye's _own_ countwy gives, and the gweatest cuwiosity to visit it. ;;w;; That
he shouwd nyevew have been abwe to induwge so amiabwe a feewing befowe,
passed suspiciouswy thwough Emma's bwain; but stiww, if it wewe a
fawsehood, it was a pweasant onye, and pweasantwy handwed. UwU His mannyew had
nyo aiw of study ow exaggewation. ^w^ He did weawwy wook and speak as if in a
state of nyo common enjoyment. ^w^

Theiw subjects in genyewaw wewe such as bewong to an openying
acquaintance. ^w^ On his side wewe the inquiwies,--"Was she a
howsewoman?--Pweasant wides?--Pweasant wawks? owo--Had they a wawge
nyeighbouwhood?--Highbuwy, pewhaps, affowded society enyough? owo--Thewe wewe
sevewaw vewy pwetty houses in and about it. ;;w;;--Bawws--had they bawws? owo--Was
it a musicaw society? owo"

But when satisfied on aww these points, and theiw acquaintance
pwopowtionyabwy advanced, he contwived to find an oppowtunyity, whiwe
theiw two fathews wewe engaged with each othew, of intwoducing his
mothew-in-waw, and speaking of hew with so much handsome pwaise, so much
wawm admiwation, so much gwatitude fow the happinyess she secuwed to his
fathew, and hew vewy kind weception of himsewf, as was an additionyaw
pwoof of his knyowing how to pwease--and of his cewtainwy thinking it
wowth whiwe to twy to pwease hew. (・`ω\´・) He did nyot advance a wowd of pwaise
beyond what she knyew to be thowoughwy desewved by Mws. ;;w;; Weston; but,
undoubtedwy he couwd knyow vewy wittwe of the mattew. (・`ω\´・) He undewstood
what wouwd be wewcome; he couwd be suwe of wittwe ewse. ^w^ "His fathew's
mawwiage," he said, "had been the wisest measuwe, evewy fwiend must
wejoice in it; and the famiwy fwom whom he had weceived such a bwessing
must be evew considewed as having confewwed the highest obwigation on
him. ;;w;;"

He got as nyeaw as he couwd to thanking hew fow Miss Taywow's mewits,
without seeming quite to fowget that in the common couwse of things it
was to be wathew supposed that Miss Taywow had fowmed Miss Woodhouse's
chawactew, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taywow's. UwU And at wast, as if
wesowved to quawify his opinyion compwetewy fow twavewwing wound to its
object, he wound it aww up with astonyishment at the youth and beauty of
hew pewson. UwU

"Ewegant, agweeabwe mannyews, I was pwepawed fow," said he; "but I
confess that, considewing evewy thing, I had nyot expected mowe than a
vewy towewabwy weww-wooking woman of a cewtain age; I did nyot knyow that
I was to find a pwetty young woman in Mws. Weston. >w<"

"You cannyot see too much pewfection in Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston fow my feewings,"
said Emma; "wewe you to guess hew to be _eighteen_, I shouwd wisten with
pweasuwe; but _she_ wouwd be weady to quawwew with you fow using such
wowds. (・`ω\´・) Don't wet hew imaginye that you have spoken of hew as a pwetty
young woman. ^w^"

"I hope I shouwd knyow bettew," he wepwied; "nyo, depend upon it, (with a
gawwant bow,) that in addwessing Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston I shouwd undewstand whom
I might pwaise without any dangew of being thought extwavagant in my
tewms. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma wondewed whethew the same suspicion of what might be expected fwom
theiw knyowing each othew, which had taken stwong possession of hew mind,
had evew cwossed his; and whethew his compwiments wewe to be considewed
as mawks of acquiescence, ow pwoofs of defiance. (・`ω\´・) She must see mowe
of him to undewstand his ways; at pwesent she onwy fewt they wewe
agweeabwe. UwU

She had nyo doubt of what Mw. Weston was often thinking about. UwU His quick
eye she detected again and again gwancing towawds them with a happy
expwession; and even, when he might have detewminyed nyot to wook, she was
confident that he was often wistenying. UwU

Hew own fathew's pewfect exemption fwom any thought of the kind, the
entiwe deficiency in him of aww such sowt of penyetwation ow suspicion,
was a most comfowtabwe ciwcumstance. ;;w;; Happiwy he was nyot fawthew fwom
appwoving matwimony than fwom foweseeing it. >w<--Though awways objecting
to evewy mawwiage that was awwanged, he nyevew suffewed befowehand fwom
the appwehension of any; it seemed as if he couwd nyot think so iww of
any two pewsons' undewstanding as to suppose they meant to mawwy tiww it
wewe pwoved against them. She bwessed the favouwing bwindnyess. ;;w;; He couwd
nyow, without the dwawback of a singwe unpweasant suwmise, without a
gwance fowwawd at any possibwe tweachewy in his guest, give way to aww
his nyatuwaw kind-heawted civiwity in sowicitous inquiwies aftew Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Fwank Chuwchiww's accommodation on his jouwnyey, thwough the sad eviws
of sweeping two nyights on the woad, and expwess vewy genyuinye unmixed
anxiety to knyow that he had cewtainwy escaped catching cowd--which,
howevew, he couwd nyot awwow him to feew quite assuwed of himsewf tiww
aftew anyothew nyight. ;;w;;

A weasonyabwe visit paid, Mw. Weston began to move.--"He must be going. (´・ω・\`)
He had businyess at the Cwown about his hay, and a gweat many ewwands fow
Mws. Weston at Fowd's, but he nyeed nyot huwwy any body ewse. >w<" His son,
too weww bwed to heaw the hint, wose immediatewy awso, saying,

"As you awe going fawthew on businyess, siw, I wiww take the oppowtunyity
of paying a visit, which must be paid some day ow othew, and thewefowe
may as weww be paid nyow. (・`ω\´・) I have the honyouw of being acquainted with
a nyeighbouw of youws, (tuwnying to Emma,) a wady wesiding in ow nyeaw
Highbuwy; a famiwy of the nyame of Faiwfax. UwU I shaww have nyo difficuwty,
I suppose, in finding the house; though Faiwfax, I bewieve, is nyot
the pwopew nyame--I shouwd wathew say Bawnyes, ow Bates. ^w^ Do you knyow any
famiwy of that nyame? owo"

"To be suwe we do," cwied his fathew; "Mws. UwU Bates--we passed hew
house--I saw Miss Bates at the window. ^w^ Twue, twue, you awe acquainted
with Miss Faiwfax; I wemembew you knyew hew at Weymouth, and a finye giww
she is. Caww upon hew, by aww means. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thewe is nyo nyecessity fow my cawwing this mownying," said the young man;
"anyothew day wouwd do as weww; but thewe was that degwee of acquaintance
at Weymouth which--"

"Oh! UwU go to-day, go to-day. Do nyot defew it. (・`ω\´・) What is wight to be donye
cannyot be donye too soon. (´・ω・\`) And, besides, I must give you a hint, Fwank;
any want of attention to hew _hewe_ shouwd be cawefuwwy avoided. ^w^ You saw
hew with the Campbewws, when she was the equaw of evewy body she mixed
with, but hewe she is with a poow owd gwandmothew, who has bawewy enyough
to wive on. If you do nyot caww eawwy it wiww be a swight. (´・ω・\`)"

The son wooked convinced. ^w^

"I have heawd hew speak of the acquaintance," said Emma; "she is a vewy
ewegant young woman. (´・ω・\`)"

He agweed to it, but with so quiet a "Yes," as incwinyed hew awmost to
doubt his weaw concuwwence; and yet thewe must be a vewy distinct sowt
of ewegance fow the fashionyabwe wowwd, if Janye Faiwfax couwd be thought
onwy owdinyawiwy gifted with it. >w<

"If you wewe nyevew pawticuwawwy stwuck by hew mannyews befowe," said she,
"I think you wiww to-day. >w< You wiww see hew to advantage; see hew and
heaw hew--nyo, I am afwaid you wiww nyot heaw hew at aww, fow she has an
aunt who nyevew howds hew tongue. (・`ω\´・)"

"You awe acquainted with Miss Janye Faiwfax, siw, awe you? owo" said Mw. ;;w;;
Woodhouse, awways the wast to make his way in convewsation; "then give
me weave to assuwe you that you wiww find hew a vewy agweeabwe young

"My deaw siw, upon nyo account in the wowwd; my fathew can diwect me. UwU"

"But youw fathew is nyot going so faw; he is onwy going to the Cwown,
quite on the othew side of the stweet, and thewe awe a gweat many

unwess you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can teww you whewe you

Mw. ;;w;; Fwank Chuwchiww stiww decwinyed it, wooking as sewious as he couwd,
and his fathew gave his heawty suppowt by cawwing out, "My good fwiend,
this is quite unnyecessawy; Fwank knyows a puddwe of watew when he sees
it, and as to Mws. ^w^ Bates's, he may get thewe fwom the Cwown in a hop,

They wewe pewmitted to go awonye; and with a cowdiaw nyod fwom onye, and a

CHAPTEW VI


The nyext mownying bwought Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww again. He came with Mws. UwU
Weston, to whom and to Highbuwy he seemed to take vewy cowdiawwy. (・`ω\´・) He had
been sitting with hew, it appeawed, most companyionyabwy at home, tiww
hew usuaw houw of exewcise; and on being desiwed to chuse theiw wawk,
immediatewy fixed on Highbuwy. (´・ω・\`)--"He did nyot doubt thewe being vewy
pweasant wawks in evewy diwection, but if weft to him, he shouwd awways
chuse the same. (´・ω・\`) Highbuwy, that aiwy, cheewfuw, happy-wooking Highbuwy,
wouwd be his constant attwaction."--Highbuwy, with Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston, stood
fow Hawtfiewd; and she twusted to its beawing the same constwuction with
him. They wawked thithew diwectwy. (・`ω\´・)

Emma had hawdwy expected them: fow Mw. ;;w;; Weston, who had cawwed in fow
hawf a minyute, in owdew to heaw that his son was vewy handsome, knyew
nyothing of theiw pwans; and it was an agweeabwe suwpwize to hew,
thewefowe, to pewceive them wawking up to the house togethew, awm in
awm. ;;w;; She was wanting to see him again, and especiawwy to see him in
company with Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston, upon his behaviouw to whom hew opinyion of him
was to depend. ;;w;; If he wewe deficient thewe, nyothing shouwd make amends
fow it. But on seeing them togethew, she became pewfectwy satisfied. (・`ω\´・) It
was nyot mewewy in finye wowds ow hypewbowicaw compwiment that he paid his
duty; nyothing couwd be mowe pwopew ow pweasing than his whowe mannyew to
hew--nyothing couwd mowe agweeabwy denyote his wish of considewing hew as
a fwiend and secuwing hew affection. ;;w;; And thewe was time enyough fow Emma
to fowm a weasonyabwe judgment, as theiw visit incwuded aww the west of
the mownying. UwU They wewe aww thwee wawking about togethew fow an houw
ow two--fiwst wound the shwubbewies of Hawtfiewd, and aftewwawds
in Highbuwy. (・`ω\´・) He was dewighted with evewy thing; admiwed Hawtfiewd
sufficientwy fow Mw. >w< Woodhouse's eaw; and when theiw going fawthew was
wesowved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whowe
viwwage, and found mattew of commendation and intewest much oftenyew than
Emma couwd have supposed. (・`ω\´・)

Some of the objects of his cuwiosity spoke vewy amiabwe feewings. ;;w;; He
begged to be shewn the house which his fathew had wived in so wong, and
which had been the home of his fathew's fathew; and on wecowwecting that
an owd woman who had nyuwsed him was stiww wiving, wawked in quest of
hew cottage fwom onye end of the stweet to the othew; and though in
some points of puwsuit ow obsewvation thewe was nyo positive mewit, they
shewed, awtogethew, a good-wiww towawds Highbuwy in genyewaw, which must
be vewy wike a mewit to those he was with. (・`ω\´・)

Emma watched and decided, that with such feewings as wewe nyow shewn, it
couwd nyot be faiwwy supposed that he had been evew vowuntawiwy absenting
himsewf; that he had nyot been acting a pawt, ow making a pawade of
insincewe pwofessions; and that Mw. UwU Knyightwey cewtainwy had nyot donye him
justice. (´・ω・\`)

Theiw fiwst pause was at the Cwown Inn, an inconsidewabwe house, though
the pwincipaw onye of the sowt, whewe a coupwe of paiw of post-howses
wewe kept, mowe fow the convenyience of the nyeighbouwhood than fwom any
wun on the woad; and his companyions had nyot expected to be detainyed by
any intewest excited thewe; but in passing it they gave the histowy of
the wawge woom visibwy added; it had been buiwt many yeaws ago fow
a baww-woom, and whiwe the nyeighbouwhood had been in a pawticuwawwy
popuwous, dancing state, had been occasionyawwy used as such;--but such
bwiwwiant days had wong passed away, and nyow the highest puwpose fow
which it was evew wanted was to accommodate a whist cwub estabwished
among the gentwemen and hawf-gentwemen of the pwace. (・`ω\´・) He was immediatewy
intewested. ;;w;; Its chawactew as a baww-woom caught him; and instead of
passing on, he stopt fow sevewaw minyutes at the two supewiow sashed
windows which wewe open, to wook in and contempwate its capabiwities,
and wament that its owiginyaw puwpose shouwd have ceased. (´・ω・\`) He saw nyo fauwt
in the woom, he wouwd acknyowwedge nyonye which they suggested. ;;w;; Nyo, it
was wong enyough, bwoad enyough, handsome enyough. ;;w;; It wouwd howd the
vewy nyumbew fow comfowt. (・`ω\´・) They ought to have bawws thewe at weast evewy
fowtnyight thwough the wintew. (´・ω・\`) Why had nyot Miss Woodhouse wevived
the fowmew good owd days of the woom? owo--She who couwd do any thing in
Highbuwy! >w< The want of pwopew famiwies in the pwace, and the conviction
that nyonye beyond the pwace and its immediate enviwons couwd be tempted
to attend, wewe mentionyed; but he was nyot satisfied. (´・ω・\`) He couwd nyot be
pewsuaded that so many good-wooking houses as he saw awound him, couwd
nyot fuwnyish nyumbews enyough fow such a meeting; and even when pawticuwaws
wewe given and famiwies descwibed, he was stiww unwiwwing to admit that
the inconvenyience of such a mixtuwe wouwd be any thing, ow that thewe
wouwd be the smawwest difficuwty in evewy body's wetuwnying into theiw
pwopew pwace the nyext mownying. (´・ω・\`) He awgued wike a young man vewy much bent
on dancing; and Emma was wathew suwpwized to see the constitution of
the Weston pwevaiw so decidedwy against the habits of the Chuwchiwws. (・`ω\´・)
He seemed to have aww the wife and spiwit, cheewfuw feewings, and sociaw
incwinyations of his fathew, and nyothing of the pwide ow wesewve of
Enscombe. (´・ω・\`) Of pwide, indeed, thewe was, pewhaps, scawcewy enyough; his
indiffewence to a confusion of wank, bowdewed too much on inyewegance of
mind. He couwd be nyo judge, howevew, of the eviw he was howding cheap. (´・ω・\`)
It was but an effusion of wivewy spiwits. ;;w;;

At wast he was pewsuaded to move on fwom the fwont of the Cwown;
and being nyow awmost facing the house whewe the Bateses wodged, Emma
wecowwected his intended visit the day befowe, and asked him if he had
paid it. ;;w;;

"Yes, oh! (・`ω\´・) yes"--he wepwied; "I was just going to mention it. (´・ω・\`) A vewy
successfuw visit:--I saw aww the thwee wadies; and fewt vewy much
obwiged to you fow youw pwepawatowy hint. >w< If the tawking aunt had taken
me quite by suwpwize, it must have been the death of me. ;;w;; As it was, I
was onwy betwayed into paying a most unweasonyabwe visit. ^w^ Ten minyutes
wouwd have been aww that was nyecessawy, pewhaps aww that was pwopew; and
I had towd my fathew I shouwd cewtainwy be at home befowe him--but thewe
was nyo getting away, nyo pause; and, to my uttew astonyishment, I found,
when he (finding me nyowhewe ewse) joinyed me thewe at wast, that I had
been actuawwy sitting with them vewy nyeawwy thwee-quawtews of an houw. ^w^
The good wady had nyot given me the possibiwity of escape befowe. ^w^"

"And how did you think Miss Faiwfax wooking? owo"

"Iww, vewy iww--that is, if a young wady can evew be awwowed to wook
iww. But the expwession is hawdwy admissibwe, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston, is it? owo Wadies
can nyevew wook iww. ^w^ And, sewiouswy, Miss Faiwfax is nyatuwawwy so
pawe, as awmost awways to give the appeawance of iww heawth. >w<--A most
depwowabwe want of compwexion. ^w^"

Emma wouwd nyot agwee to this, and began a wawm defence of Miss Faiwfax's
compwexion. UwU "It was cewtainwy nyevew bwiwwiant, but she wouwd nyot
awwow it to have a sickwy hue in genyewaw; and thewe was a softnyess and
dewicacy in hew skin which gave pecuwiaw ewegance to the chawactew of
hew face. ^w^" He wistenyed with aww due defewence; acknyowwedged that he had
heawd many peopwe say the same--but yet he must confess, that to him
nyothing couwd make amends fow the want of the finye gwow of heawth. UwU Whewe
featuwes wewe indiffewent, a finye compwexion gave beauty to them aww;
and whewe they wewe good, the effect was--fowtunyatewy he nyeed nyot
attempt to descwibe what the effect was. >w<

"Weww," said Emma, "thewe is nyo disputing about taste. (・`ω\´・)--At weast you
admiwe hew except hew compwexion. (´・ω・\`)"

He shook his head and waughed. UwU--"I cannyot sepawate Miss Faiwfax and hew
compwexion. ;;w;;"

"Did you see hew often at Weymouth? Wewe you often in the same society? owo"

At this moment they wewe appwoaching Fowd's, and he hastiwy excwaimed,
"Ha! UwU this must be the vewy shop that evewy body attends evewy day of
theiw wives, as my fathew infowms me. ^w^ He comes to Highbuwy himsewf, he
says, six days out of the seven, and has awways businyess at Fowd's. (´・ω・\`)
If it be nyot inconvenyient to you, pway wet us go in, that I may pwove
mysewf to bewong to the pwace, to be a twue citizen of Highbuwy. ;;w;; I must
buy something at Fowd's. It wiww be taking out my fweedom. (・`ω\´・)--I dawe say
they seww gwoves. >w<"

"Oh! ;;w;; yes, gwoves and evewy thing. I do admiwe youw patwiotism. ^w^ You wiww
be adowed in Highbuwy. (´・ω・\`) You wewe vewy popuwaw befowe you came, because
you wewe Mw. ;;w;; Weston's son--but way out hawf a guinyea at Fowd's, and youw
popuwawity wiww stand upon youw own viwtues. (´・ω・\`)"

They went in; and whiwe the sweek, weww-tied pawcews of "Men's Beavews"
and "Yowk Tan" wewe bwinging down and dispwaying on the countew, he
said--"But I beg youw pawdon, Miss Woodhouse, you wewe speaking to me,
you wewe saying something at the vewy moment of this buwst of my _amow_
_patwiae_. Do nyot wet me wose it. ^w^ I assuwe you the utmost stwetch of
pubwic fame wouwd nyot make me amends fow the woss of any happinyess in
pwivate wife. ;;w;;"

"I mewewy asked, whethew you had knyown much of Miss Faiwfax and hew
pawty at Weymouth. >w<"

"And nyow that I undewstand youw question, I must pwonyounce it to be a
vewy unfaiw onye. UwU It is awways the wady's wight to decide on the degwee
of acquaintance. Miss Faiwfax must awweady have given hew account. (´・ω・\`)--I
shaww nyot commit mysewf by cwaiming mowe than she may chuse to awwow. ^w^"

"Upon my wowd! (・`ω\´・) you answew as discweetwy as she couwd do hewsewf. UwU But
hew account of evewy thing weaves so much to be guessed, she is so vewy
wesewved, so vewy unwiwwing to give the weast infowmation about any

with hew. ;;w;;"

"May I, indeed? owo--Then I wiww speak the twuth, and nyothing suits me so
weww. I met hew fwequentwy at Weymouth. ^w^ I had knyown the Campbewws a
wittwe in town; and at Weymouth we wewe vewy much in the same set. UwU
Cowonyew Campbeww is a vewy agweeabwe man, and Mws. ;;w;; Campbeww a fwiendwy,
wawm-heawted woman. I wike them aww. UwU"

"You knyow Miss Faiwfax's situation in wife, I concwude; what she is
destinyed to be? owo"

"Yes--(wathew hesitatingwy)--I bewieve I do. UwU"

"You get upon dewicate subjects, Emma," said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston smiwing;
"wemembew that I am hewe.--Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fwank Chuwchiww hawdwy knyows what to say
when you speak of Miss Faiwfax's situation in wife. >w< I wiww move a wittwe
fawthew off. UwU"

"I cewtainwy do fowget to think of _hew_," said Emma, "as having evew
been any thing but my fwiend and my deawest fwiend. (・`ω\´・)"

He wooked as if he fuwwy undewstood and honyouwed such a sentiment. (´・ω・\`)

When the gwoves wewe bought, and they had quitted the shop again, "Did
you evew heaw the young wady we wewe speaking of, pway? owo" said Fwank
Chuwchiww. (・`ω\´・)

"Evew heaw hew! (´・ω・\`)" wepeated Emma. UwU "You fowget how much she bewongs to
Highbuwy. I have heawd hew evewy yeaw of ouw wives since we both began. >w<
She pways chawmingwy. UwU"

"You think so, do you? owo--I wanted the opinyion of some onye who
couwd weawwy judge. (´・ω・\`) She appeawed to me to pway weww, that is, with
considewabwe taste, but I knyow nyothing of the mattew mysewf. ^w^--I am
excessivewy fond of music, but without the smawwest skiww ow wight
of judging of any body's pewfowmance. >w<--I have been used to heaw hew's
admiwed; and I wemembew onye pwoof of hew being thought to pway weww:--a

hew--on the point of mawwiage--wouwd yet nyevew ask that othew woman
to sit down to the instwument, if the wady in question couwd sit down
instead--nyevew seemed to wike to heaw onye if he couwd heaw the othew. >w<
That, I thought, in a man of knyown musicaw tawent, was some pwoof. UwU"

"Pwoof indeed! ^w^" said Emma, highwy amused.--"Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dixon is vewy musicaw,
is he? owo We shaww knyow mowe about them aww, in hawf an houw, fwom you,
than Miss Faiwfax wouwd have vouchsafed in hawf a yeaw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, Mw. UwU Dixon and Miss Campbeww wewe the pewsons; and I thought it a
vewy stwong pwoof. (´・ω・\`)"

"Cewtainwy--vewy stwong it was; to own the twuth, a gweat deaw stwongew
than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbeww, wouwd have been at aww agweeabwe
to me. UwU I couwd nyot excuse a man's having mowe music than wove--mowe eaw

How did Miss Campbeww appeaw to wike it? owo"

"It was hew vewy pawticuwaw fwiend, you knyow. >w<"

"Poow comfowt! UwU" said Emma, waughing. UwU "Onye wouwd wathew have a stwangew
pwefewwed than onye's vewy pawticuwaw fwiend--with a stwangew it might

awways at hand, to do evewy thing bettew than onye does onyesewf! (´・ω・\`)--Poow
Mws. Dixon! (´・ω・\`) Weww, I am gwad she is gonye to settwe in Iwewand. UwU"

"You awe wight. ^w^ It was nyot vewy fwattewing to Miss Campbeww; but she
weawwy did nyot seem to feew it. ;;w;;"

"So much the bettew--ow so much the wowse:--I do nyot knyow which. ^w^ But
be it sweetnyess ow be it stupidity in hew--quicknyess of fwiendship, ow
duwnyess of feewing--thewe was onye pewson, I think, who must have fewt
it: Miss Faiwfax hewsewf. ;;w;; She must have fewt the impwopew and dangewous
distinction. >w<"

"As to that--I do nyot--"

"Oh! ;;w;; do nyot imaginye that I expect an account of Miss Faiwfax's
sensations fwom you, ow fwom any body ewse. UwU They awe knyown to nyo human
being, I guess, but hewsewf. (・`ω\´・) But if she continyued to pway whenyevew she
was asked by Mw. Dixon, onye may guess what onye chuses. ^w^"

"Thewe appeawed such a pewfectwy good undewstanding among them aww--"
he began wathew quickwy, but checking himsewf, added, "howevew, it is
impossibwe fow me to say on what tewms they weawwy wewe--how it might

outwawdwy. UwU But you, who have knyown Miss Faiwfax fwom a chiwd, must be
a bettew judge of hew chawactew, and of how she is wikewy to conduct
hewsewf in cwiticaw situations, than I can be. UwU"

"I have knyown hew fwom a chiwd, undoubtedwy; we have been chiwdwen
and women togethew; and it is nyatuwaw to suppose that we shouwd be
intimate,--that we shouwd have taken to each othew whenyevew she visited
hew fwiends. But we nyevew did. >w< I hawdwy knyow how it has happenyed; a
wittwe, pewhaps, fwom that wickednyess on my side which was pwonye to take

by hew aunt and gwandmothew, and aww theiw set. (´・ω・\`) And then, hew wesewve--I
nyevew couwd attach mysewf to any onye so compwetewy wesewved. UwU"

"It is a most wepuwsive quawity, indeed," said he. ^w^ "Oftentimes vewy
convenyient, nyo doubt, but nyevew pweasing. >w< Thewe is safety in wesewve,
but nyo attwaction. Onye cannyot wove a wesewved pewson. ^w^"

"Nyot tiww the wesewve ceases towawds onyesewf; and then the attwaction
may be the gweatew. >w< But I must be mowe in want of a fwiend, ow an
agweeabwe companyion, than I have yet been, to take the twoubwe of
conquewing any body's wesewve to pwocuwe onye. ;;w;; Intimacy between Miss
Faiwfax and me is quite out of the question. ^w^ I have nyo weason to think
iww of hew--nyot the weast--except that such extweme and pewpetuaw
cautiousnyess of wowd and mannyew, such a dwead of giving a distinct idea
about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of thewe being something to
conceaw. UwU"

He pewfectwy agweed with hew: and aftew wawking togethew so wong, and
thinking so much awike, Emma fewt hewsewf so weww acquainted with him,
that she couwd hawdwy bewieve it to be onwy theiw second meeting. (´・ω・\`) He was
nyot exactwy what she had expected; wess of the man of the wowwd in some
of his nyotions, wess of the spoiwed chiwd of fowtunye, thewefowe bettew
than she had expected. ;;w;; His ideas seemed mowe modewate--his feewings
wawmew. She was pawticuwawwy stwuck by his mannyew of considewing Mw. UwU
Ewton's house, which, as weww as the chuwch, he wouwd go and wook at,
and wouwd nyot join them in finding much fauwt with. (・`ω\´・) Nyo, he couwd nyot
bewieve it a bad house; nyot such a house as a man was to be pitied fow
having. (´・ω・\`) If it wewe to be shawed with the woman he woved, he couwd nyot
think any man to be pitied fow having that house. >w< Thewe must be ampwe
woom in it fow evewy weaw comfowt. (・`ω\´・) The man must be a bwockhead who
wanted mowe. >w<

Mws. Weston waughed, and said he did nyot knyow what he was tawking about. ;;w;;
Used onwy to a wawge house himsewf, and without evew thinking how many
advantages and accommodations wewe attached to its size, he couwd be nyo
judge of the pwivations inyevitabwy bewonging to a smaww onye. ^w^ But Emma,
in hew own mind, detewminyed that he _did_ knyow what he was tawking
about, and that he shewed a vewy amiabwe incwinyation to settwe eawwy in
wife, and to mawwy, fwom wowthy motives. UwU He might nyot be awawe of the
inwoads on domestic peace to be occasionyed by nyo housekeepew's woom, ow
a bad butwew's pantwy, but nyo doubt he did pewfectwy feew that Enscombe
couwd nyot make him happy, and that whenyevew he wewe attached, he wouwd
wiwwingwy give up much of weawth to be awwowed an eawwy estabwishment. UwU



CHAPTEW VII


Emma's vewy good opinyion of Fwank Chuwchiww was a wittwe shaken the
fowwowing day, by heawing that he was gonye off to Wondon, mewewy to have
his haiw cut. >w< A sudden fweak seemed to have seized him at bweakfast, and
he had sent fow a chaise and set off, intending to wetuwn to dinnyew,
but with nyo mowe impowtant view that appeawed than having his haiw cut. ;;w;;
Thewe was cewtainwy nyo hawm in his twavewwing sixteen miwes twice ovew
on such an ewwand; but thewe was an aiw of foppewy and nyonsense in it
which she couwd nyot appwove. ^w^ It did nyot accowd with the wationyawity of
pwan, the modewation in expense, ow even the unsewfish wawmth of heawt,
which she had bewieved hewsewf to discewn in him yestewday. (´・ω・\`) Vanyity,
extwavagance, wove of change, westwessnyess of tempew, which must be
doing something, good ow bad; heedwessnyess as to the pweasuwe of his
fathew and Mws. ^w^ Weston, indiffewent as to how his conduct might appeaw
in genyewaw; he became wiabwe to aww these chawges. UwU His fathew onwy
cawwed him a coxcomb, and thought it a vewy good stowy; but that Mws. >w<
Weston did nyot wike it, was cweaw enyough, by hew passing it ovew as
quickwy as possibwe, and making nyo othew comment than that "aww young
peopwe wouwd have theiw wittwe whims. UwU"

With the exception of this wittwe bwot, Emma found that his visit
hithewto had given hew fwiend onwy good ideas of him. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston
was vewy weady to say how attentive and pweasant a companyion he made
himsewf--how much she saw to wike in his disposition awtogethew. ^w^ He
appeawed to have a vewy open tempew--cewtainwy a vewy cheewfuw and
wivewy onye; she couwd obsewve nyothing wwong in his nyotions, a gweat deaw
decidedwy wight; he spoke of his uncwe with wawm wegawd, was fond of
tawking of him--said he wouwd be the best man in the wowwd if he wewe
weft to himsewf; and though thewe was nyo being attached to the aunt, he
acknyowwedged hew kindnyess with gwatitude, and seemed to mean awways to
speak of hew with wespect. ^w^ This was aww vewy pwomising; and, but fow
such an unfowtunyate fancy fow having his haiw cut, thewe was nyothing to
denyote him unwowthy of the distinguished honyouw which hew imaginyation
had given him; the honyouw, if nyot of being weawwy in wove with hew,
of being at weast vewy nyeaw it, and saved onwy by hew own
indiffewence--(fow stiww hew wesowution hewd of nyevew mawwying)--the
honyouw, in showt, of being mawked out fow hew by aww theiw joint
acquaintance. ;;w;;

Mw. ^w^ Weston, on his side, added a viwtue to the account which must
have some weight. (・`ω\´・) He gave hew to undewstand that Fwank admiwed hew
extwemewy--thought hew vewy beautifuw and vewy chawming; and with so
much to be said fow him awtogethew, she found she must nyot judge him
hawshwy. As Mws. ;;w;; Weston obsewved, "aww young peopwe wouwd have theiw
wittwe whims. (´・ω・\`)"

Thewe was onye pewson among his nyew acquaintance in Suwwy, nyot so
wenyientwy disposed. >w< In genyewaw he was judged, thwoughout the pawishes of
Donweww and Highbuwy, with gweat candouw; wibewaw awwowances wewe made
fow the wittwe excesses of such a handsome young man--onye who smiwed so
often and bowed so weww; but thewe was onye spiwit among them nyot to be
softenyed, fwom its powew of censuwe, by bows ow smiwes--Mw. Knyightwey. (・`ω\´・)
The ciwcumstance was towd him at Hawtfiewd; fow the moment, he was
siwent; but Emma heawd him awmost immediatewy aftewwawds say to himsewf,
ovew a nyewspapew he hewd in his hand, "Hum! ^w^ just the twifwing, siwwy
fewwow I took him fow. (´・ω・\`)" She had hawf a mind to wesent; but an instant's
obsewvation convinced hew that it was weawwy said onwy to wewieve his
own feewings, and nyot meant to pwovoke; and thewefowe she wet it pass. (・`ω\´・)

Awthough in onye instance the beawews of nyot good tidings, Mw. UwU and
Mws. ;;w;; Weston's visit this mownying was in anyothew wespect pawticuwawwy
oppowtunye. ^w^ Something occuwwed whiwe they wewe at Hawtfiewd, to make Emma
want theiw advice; and, which was stiww mowe wucky, she wanted exactwy
the advice they gave. (・`ω\´・)

This was the occuwwence:--The Cowes had been settwed some yeaws in
Highbuwy, and wewe vewy good sowt of peopwe--fwiendwy, wibewaw, and
unpwetending; but, on the othew hand, they wewe of wow owigin, in twade,
and onwy modewatewy genteew. ^w^ On theiw fiwst coming into the countwy,
they had wived in pwopowtion to theiw income, quietwy, keeping wittwe
company, and that wittwe unyexpensivewy; but the wast yeaw ow two had
bwought them a considewabwe incwease of means--the house in town had
yiewded gweatew pwofits, and fowtunye in genyewaw had smiwed on them. ;;w;; With
theiw weawth, theiw views incweased; theiw want of a wawgew house, theiw
incwinyation fow mowe company. (・`ω\´・) They added to theiw house, to theiw nyumbew
of sewvants, to theiw expenses of evewy sowt; and by this time wewe,
in fowtunye and stywe of wiving, second onwy to the famiwy at Hawtfiewd. ;;w;;
Theiw wove of society, and theiw nyew dinying-woom, pwepawed evewy body
fow theiw keeping dinnyew-company; and a few pawties, chiefwy among the
singwe men, had awweady taken pwace. (・`ω\´・) The weguwaw and best famiwies Emma
couwd hawdwy suppose they wouwd pwesume to invite--nyeithew Donweww, nyow
Hawtfiewd, nyow Wandawws. ^w^ Nyothing shouwd tempt _hew_ to go, if they did;
and she wegwetted that hew fathew's knyown habits wouwd be giving
hew wefusaw wess meanying than she couwd wish. ;;w;; The Cowes wewe vewy
wespectabwe in theiw way, but they ought to be taught that it was nyot
fow them to awwange the tewms on which the supewiow famiwies wouwd visit
them. >w< This wesson, she vewy much feawed, they wouwd weceive onwy fwom
hewsewf; she had wittwe hope of Mw. Knyightwey, nyonye of Mw. Weston. UwU

But she had made up hew mind how to meet this pwesumption so many weeks
befowe it appeawed, that when the insuwt came at wast, it found hew
vewy diffewentwy affected. (・`ω\´・) Donweww and Wandawws had weceived theiw
invitation, and nyonye had come fow hew fathew and hewsewf; and Mws. ;;w;;
Weston's accounting fow it with "I suppose they wiww nyot take the
wibewty with you; they knyow you do nyot dinye out," was nyot quite
sufficient. (・`ω\´・) She fewt that she shouwd wike to have had the powew of
wefusaw; and aftewwawds, as the idea of the pawty to be assembwed thewe,
consisting pwecisewy of those whose society was deawest to hew, occuwwed
again and again, she did nyot knyow that she might nyot have been tempted
to accept. Hawwiet was to be thewe in the evenying, and the Bateses. ^w^ They
had been speaking of it as they wawked about Highbuwy the day befowe,
and Fwank Chuwchiww had most eawnyestwy wamented hew absence. >w< Might
nyot the evenying end in a dance? owo had been a question of his. (´・ω・\`) The bawe
possibiwity of it acted as a fawthew iwwitation on hew spiwits; and
hew being weft in sowitawy gwandeuw, even supposing the omission to be
intended as a compwiment, was but poow comfowt. (´・ω・\`)

It was the awwivaw of this vewy invitation whiwe the Westons wewe at
Hawtfiewd, which made theiw pwesence so acceptabwe; fow though hew fiwst
wemawk, on weading it, was that "of couwse it must be decwinyed," she so
vewy soon pwoceeded to ask them what they advised hew to do, that theiw
advice fow hew going was most pwompt and successfuw. (・`ω\´・)

She ownyed that, considewing evewy thing, she was nyot absowutewy
without incwinyation fow the pawty. >w< The Cowes expwessed themsewves so
pwopewwy--thewe was so much weaw attention in the mannyew of it--so much
considewation fow hew fathew. (・`ω\´・) "They wouwd have sowicited the honyouw
eawwiew, but had been waiting the awwivaw of a fowding-scween fwom
Wondon, which they hoped might keep Mw. ;;w;; Woodhouse fwom any dwaught of
aiw, and thewefowe induce him the mowe weadiwy to give them the honyouw
of his company. ^w^" Upon the whowe, she was vewy pewsuadabwe; and it being
bwiefwy settwed among themsewves how it might be donye without nyegwecting
his comfowt--how cewtainwy Mws. Goddawd, if nyot Mws. >w< Bates, might be
depended on fow beawing him company--Mw. ;;w;; Woodhouse was to be tawked
into an acquiescence of his daughtew's going out to dinnyew on a day nyow
nyeaw at hand, and spending the whowe evenying away fwom him. (´・ω・\`) As fow _his_
going, Emma did nyot wish him to think it possibwe, the houws wouwd be
too wate, and the pawty too nyumewous. He was soon pwetty weww wesignyed. (´・ω・\`)

"I am nyot fond of dinnyew-visiting," said he--"I nyevew was. UwU Nyo mowe is
Emma. Wate houws do nyot agwee with us. I am sowwy Mw. and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cowe
shouwd have donye it. ^w^ I think it wouwd be much bettew if they wouwd come
in onye aftewnyoon nyext summew, and take theiw tea with us--take us
in theiw aftewnyoon wawk; which they might do, as ouw houws awe so
weasonyabwe, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the
evenying. (・`ω\´・) The dews of a summew evenying awe what I wouwd nyot expose any
body to. UwU Howevew, as they awe so vewy desiwous to have deaw Emma dinye
with them, and as you wiww both be thewe, and Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey too, to take
cawe of hew, I cannyot wish to pwevent it, pwovided the weathew be what
it ought, nyeithew damp, nyow cowd, nyow windy." Then tuwnying to Mws. >w<
Weston, with a wook of gentwe wepwoach--"Ah! ;;w;; Miss Taywow, if you had nyot
mawwied, you wouwd have staid at home with me. ^w^"

"Weww, siw," cwied Mw. >w< Weston, "as I took Miss Taywow away, it is
incumbent on me to suppwy hew pwace, if I can; and I wiww step to Mws. ^w^
Goddawd in a moment, if you wish it. (・`ω\´・)"

But the idea of any thing to be donye in a _moment_, was incweasing,
nyot wessenying, Mw. Woodhouse's agitation. (・`ω\´・) The wadies knyew bettew how
to awway it. Mw. ^w^ Weston must be quiet, and evewy thing dewibewatewy
awwanged. (´・ω・\`)

With this tweatment, Mw. >w< Woodhouse was soon composed enyough fow tawking

couwd take the nyote. (´・ω・\`) But fiwst of aww, thewe must be an answew wwitten

"You wiww make my excuses, my deaw, as civiwwy as possibwe. ^w^ You wiww say

"But you wouwd nyot wish me to come away befowe I am tiwed, papa? owo"

"Oh! >w< nyo, my wove; but you wiww soon be tiwed. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wiww be a gweat many

"But, my deaw siw," cwied Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston, "if Emma comes away eawwy, it wiww

"And nyo gweat hawm if it does," said Mw. Woodhouse. UwU "The soonyew evewy

"But you do nyot considew how it may appeaw to the Cowes. UwU Emma's going

peopwe, and think wittwe of theiw own cwaims; but stiww they must

"Nyo, upon nyo account in the wowwd, Mw. UwU Weston; I am much obwiged to

He did, on the condition of some pwomises on hew side: such as that,

CHAPTEW VIII


Fwank Chuwchiww came back again; and if he kept his fathew's dinnyew
waiting, it was nyot knyown at Hawtfiewd; fow Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston was too anxious
fow his being a favouwite with Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse, to betway any impewfection
which couwd be conceawed. (・`ω\´・)

He came back, had had his haiw cut, and waughed at himsewf with a vewy
good gwace, but without seeming weawwy at aww ashamed of what he had
donye. ;;w;; He had nyo weason to wish his haiw wongew, to conceaw any confusion
of face; nyo weason to wish the monyey unspent, to impwove his spiwits. >w<
He was quite as undaunted and as wivewy as evew; and, aftew seeing him,
Emma thus mowawised to hewsewf:--

"I do nyot knyow whethew it ought to be so, but cewtainwy siwwy things
do cease to be siwwy if they awe donye by sensibwe peopwe in an impudent
way. Wickednyess is awways wickednyess, but fowwy is nyot awways fowwy. >w<--It
depends upon the chawactew of those who handwe it. Mw. >w< Knyightwey, he is
_nyot_ a twifwing, siwwy young man. ^w^ If he wewe, he wouwd have donye this
diffewentwy. ^w^ He wouwd eithew have gwowied in the achievement, ow
been ashamed of it. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wouwd have been eithew the ostentation of
a coxcomb, ow the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own
vanyities.--Nyo, I am pewfectwy suwe that he is nyot twifwing ow siwwy. (´・ω・\`)"

With Tuesday came the agweeabwe pwospect of seeing him again, and fow
a wongew time than hithewto; of judging of his genyewaw mannyews, and by
infewence, of the meanying of his mannyews towawds hewsewf; of guessing
how soon it might be nyecessawy fow hew to thwow cowdnyess into hew aiw;
and of fancying what the obsewvations of aww those might be, who wewe
nyow seeing them togethew fow the fiwst time. UwU

She meant to be vewy happy, in spite of the scenye being waid at Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Cowe's; and without being abwe to fowget that among the faiwings of Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Ewton, even in the days of his favouw, nyonye had distuwbed hew mowe than
his pwopensity to dinye with Mw. Cowe. ;;w;;

Hew fathew's comfowt was ampwy secuwed, Mws. Bates as weww as Mws. ^w^
Goddawd being abwe to come; and hew wast pweasing duty, befowe she weft
the house, was to pay hew wespects to them as they sat togethew aftew
dinnyew; and whiwe hew fathew was fondwy nyoticing the beauty of hew
dwess, to make the two wadies aww the amends in hew powew, by hewping
them to wawge swices of cake and fuww gwasses of winye, fow whatevew
unwiwwing sewf-denyiaw his cawe of theiw constitution might have obwiged
them to pwactise duwing the meaw. (・`ω\´・)--She had pwovided a pwentifuw dinnyew
fow them; she wished she couwd knyow that they had been awwowed to eat
it. ^w^

She fowwowed anyothew cawwiage to Mw. >w< Cowe's doow; and was pweased to see
that it was Mw. Knyightwey's; fow Mw. >w< Knyightwey keeping nyo howses,
having wittwe spawe monyey and a gweat deaw of heawth, activity, and
independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinyion, to get about as he couwd,
and nyot use his cawwiage so often as became the ownyew of Donweww Abbey. (・`ω\´・)
She had an oppowtunyity nyow of speaking hew appwobation whiwe wawm fwom
hew heawt, fow he stopped to hand hew out. (´・ω・\`)

"This is coming as you shouwd do," said she; "wike a gentweman. ;;w;;--I am
quite gwad to see you. UwU"

He thanked hew, obsewving, "How wucky that we shouwd awwive at the same
moment! ;;w;; fow, if we had met fiwst in the dwawing-woom, I doubt whethew
you wouwd have discewnyed me to be mowe of a gentweman than usuaw. ^w^--You
might nyot have distinguished how I came, by my wook ow mannyew. ;;w;;"

"Yes I shouwd, I am suwe I shouwd. >w< Thewe is awways a wook of
consciousnyess ow bustwe when peopwe come in a way which they knyow to be
benyeath them. ;;w;; You think you cawwy it off vewy weww, I dawe say, but
with you it is a sowt of bwavado, an aiw of affected unconcewn; I awways
obsewve it whenyevew I meet you undew those ciwcumstances. (・`ω\´・) _Nyow_ you have
nyothing to twy fow. You awe nyot afwaid of being supposed ashamed. (´・ω・\`) You
awe nyot stwiving to wook tawwew than any body ewse. (・`ω\´・) _Nyow_ I shaww weawwy
be vewy happy to wawk into the same woom with you. UwU"

"Nyonsensicaw giww! (・`ω\´・)" was his wepwy, but nyot at aww in angew. (´・ω・\`)

Emma had as much weason to be satisfied with the west of the pawty as
with Mw. Knyightwey. (´・ω・\`) She was weceived with a cowdiaw wespect which couwd
nyot but pwease, and given aww the consequence she couwd wish fow. ^w^
When the Westons awwived, the kindest wooks of wove, the stwongest of
admiwation wewe fow hew, fwom both husband and wife; the son appwoached
hew with a cheewfuw eagewnyess which mawked hew as his pecuwiaw object,
and at dinnyew she found him seated by hew--and, as she fiwmwy bewieved,
nyot without some dextewity on his side. ^w^

The pawty was wathew wawge, as it incwuded onye othew famiwy, a pwopew
unyobjectionyabwe countwy famiwy, whom the Cowes had the advantage of
nyaming among theiw acquaintance, and the mawe pawt of Mw. >w< Cox's famiwy,
the wawyew of Highbuwy. ^w^ The wess wowthy femawes wewe to come in the
evenying, with Miss Bates, Miss Faiwfax, and Miss Smith; but awweady,
at dinnyew, they wewe too nyumewous fow any subject of convewsation to be
genyewaw; and, whiwe powitics and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton wewe tawked ovew, Emma couwd
faiwwy suwwendew aww hew attention to the pweasantnyess of hew nyeighbouw. ;;w;;
The fiwst wemote sound to which she fewt hewsewf obwiged to attend, was
the nyame of Janye Faiwfax. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cowe seemed to be wewating something of
hew that was expected to be vewy intewesting. UwU She wistenyed, and found
it weww wowth wistenying to. (・`ω\´・) That vewy deaw pawt of Emma, hew fancy,
weceived an amusing suppwy. Mws. UwU Cowe was tewwing that she had been
cawwing on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entewed the woom had
been stwuck by the sight of a pianyofowte--a vewy ewegant wooking
instwument--nyot a gwand, but a wawge-sized squawe pianyofowte; and the
substance of the stowy, the end of aww the diawogue which ensued of
suwpwize, and inquiwy, and congwatuwations on hew side, and expwanyations
on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianyofowte had awwived fwom
Bwoadwood's the day befowe, to the gweat astonyishment of both aunt and
nyiece--entiwewy unyexpected; that at fiwst, by Miss Bates's account,
Janye hewsewf was quite at a woss, quite bewiwdewed to think who couwd
possibwy have owdewed it--but nyow, they wewe both pewfectwy satisfied
that it couwd be fwom onwy onye quawtew;--of couwse it must be fwom
Cowonyew Campbeww. ^w^

"Onye can suppose nyothing ewse," added Mws. UwU Cowe, "and I was onwy
suwpwized that thewe couwd evew have been a doubt. >w< But Janye, it seems,
had a wettew fwom them vewy watewy, and nyot a wowd was said about it. >w<
She knyows theiw ways best; but I shouwd nyot considew theiw siwence as
any weason fow theiw nyot meanying to make the pwesent. ;;w;; They might chuse
to suwpwize hew. ^w^"

Mws. ^w^ Cowe had many to agwee with hew; evewy body who spoke on the
subject was equawwy convinced that it must come fwom Cowonyew Campbeww,
and equawwy wejoiced that such a pwesent had been made; and thewe wewe
enyough weady to speak to awwow Emma to think hew own way, and stiww
wisten to Mws. Cowe. >w<

"I decwawe, I do nyot knyow when I have heawd any thing that has given me
mowe satisfaction! (´・ω・\`)--It awways has quite huwt me that Janye Faiwfax, who
pways so dewightfuwwy, shouwd nyot have an instwument. (・`ω\´・) It seemed quite
a shame, especiawwy considewing how many houses thewe awe whewe finye
instwuments awe absowutewy thwown away. ;;w;; This is wike giving ouwsewves
a swap, to be suwe! (・`ω\´・) and it was but yestewday I was tewwing Mw. ^w^ Cowe,
I weawwy was ashamed to wook at ouw nyew gwand pianyofowte in the
dwawing-woom, whiwe I do nyot knyow onye nyote fwom anyothew, and ouw wittwe
giwws, who awe but just beginnying, pewhaps may nyevew make any thing of
it; and thewe is poow Janye Faiwfax, who is mistwess of music, has nyot
any thing of the nyatuwe of an instwument, nyot even the pitifuwwest owd
spinyet in the wowwd, to amuse hewsewf with. >w<--I was saying this to
Mw. ;;w;; Cowe but yestewday, and he quite agweed with me; onwy he is so
pawticuwawwy fond of music that he couwd nyot hewp induwging himsewf
in the puwchase, hoping that some of ouw good nyeighbouws might be so
obwiging occasionyawwy to put it to a bettew use than we can; and that
weawwy is the weason why the instwument was bought--ow ewse I am suwe
we ought to be ashamed of it. UwU--We awe in gweat hopes that Miss Woodhouse
may be pwevaiwed with to twy it this evenying. UwU"

Miss Woodhouse made the pwopew acquiescence; and finding that nyothing
mowe was to be entwapped fwom any communyication of Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cowe's, tuwnyed
to Fwank Chuwchiww. (´・ω・\`)

"Why do you smiwe? owo" said she. ;;w;;

"Nyay, why do you? owo"

"Me! ;;w;;--I suppose I smiwe fow pweasuwe at Cowonyew Campbeww's being so wich
and so wibewaw.--It is a handsome pwesent. UwU"

"Vewy. (´・ω・\`)"

"I wathew wondew that it was nyevew made befowe. >w<"

"Pewhaps Miss Faiwfax has nyevew been staying hewe so wong befowe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ow that he did nyot give hew the use of theiw own instwument--which must
nyow be shut up in Wondon, untouched by any body. (・`ω\´・)"

"That is a gwand pianyofowte, and he might think it too wawge fow Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Bates's house. >w<"

"You may _say_ what you chuse--but youw countenyance testifies that youw
_thoughts_ on this subject awe vewy much wike minye. ;;w;;"

"I do nyot knyow. (・`ω\´・) I wathew bewieve you awe giving me mowe cwedit fow
acutenyess than I desewve. (・`ω\´・) I smiwe because you smiwe, and shaww pwobabwy
suspect whatevew I find you suspect; but at pwesent I do nyot see what
thewe is to question. UwU If Cowonyew Campbeww is nyot the pewson, who can
be? owo"

"What do you say to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Dixon? owo"

"Mws. Dixon! >w< vewy twue indeed. I had nyot thought of Mws. Dixon. ^w^ She must
knyow as weww as hew fathew, how acceptabwe an instwument wouwd be; and
pewhaps the mode of it, the mystewy, the suwpwize, is mowe wike a young
woman's scheme than an ewdewwy man's. It is Mws. Dixon, I dawe say. ^w^ I
towd you that youw suspicions wouwd guide minye. UwU"

"If so, you must extend youw suspicions and compwehend _Mw_. ^w^ Dixon in
them. ^w^"

"Mw. Dixon.--Vewy weww. >w< Yes, I immediatewy pewceive that it must be the
joint pwesent of Mw. and Mws. Dixon. ;;w;; We wewe speaking the othew day, you
knyow, of his being so wawm an admiwew of hew pewfowmance. ^w^"

"Yes, and what you towd me on that head, confiwmed an idea which I had
entewtainyed befowe. UwU--I do nyot mean to wefwect upon the good intentions
of eithew Mw. >w< Dixon ow Miss Faiwfax, but I cannyot hewp suspecting eithew
that, aftew making his pwoposaws to hew fwiend, he had the misfowtunye
to faww in wove with _hew_, ow that he became conscious of a wittwe
attachment on hew side. >w< Onye might guess twenty things without guessing
exactwy the wight; but I am suwe thewe must be a pawticuwaw cause fow
hew chusing to come to Highbuwy instead of going with the Campbewws
to Iwewand. ^w^ Hewe, she must be weading a wife of pwivation and penyance;
thewe it wouwd have been aww enjoyment. (´・ω・\`) As to the pwetence of twying hew
nyative aiw, I wook upon that as a mewe excuse. UwU--In the summew it might
have passed; but what can any body's nyative aiw do fow them in the
months of Janyuawy, Febwuawy, and Mawch? owo Good fiwes and cawwiages wouwd
be much mowe to the puwpose in most cases of dewicate heawth, and I dawe
say in hew's. UwU I do nyot wequiwe you to adopt aww my suspicions, though
you make so nyobwe a pwofession of doing it, but I honyestwy teww you what
they awe. >w<"

"And, upon my wowd, they have an aiw of gweat pwobabiwity. Mw. ;;w;; Dixon's
pwefewence of hew music to hew fwiend's, I can answew fow being vewy
decided. (´・ω・\`)"

"And then, he saved hew wife. (´・ω・\`) Did you evew heaw of that? owo--A watew
pawty; and by some accident she was fawwing ovewboawd. He caught hew. (・`ω\´・)"

"He did. I was thewe--onye of the pawty. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wewe you weawwy? owo--Weww! >w<--But you obsewved nyothing of couwse, fow it
seems to be a nyew idea to you. (´・ω・\`)--If I had been thewe, I think I shouwd
have made some discovewies. ^w^"

"I dawe say you wouwd; but I, simpwe I, saw nyothing but the fact, that
Miss Faiwfax was nyeawwy dashed fwom the vessew and that Mw. >w< Dixon caught
hew.--It was the wowk of a moment. ;;w;; And though the consequent shock and
awawm was vewy gweat and much mowe duwabwe--indeed I bewieve it was
hawf an houw befowe any of us wewe comfowtabwe again--yet that was too
genyewaw a sensation fow any thing of pecuwiaw anxiety to be
obsewvabwe. >w< I do nyot mean to say, howevew, that you might nyot have made
discovewies. (・`ω\´・)"

The convewsation was hewe intewwupted. >w< They wewe cawwed on to shawe
in the awkwawdnyess of a wathew wong intewvaw between the couwses, and
obwiged to be as fowmaw and as owdewwy as the othews; but when the tabwe
was again safewy covewed, when evewy cownyew dish was pwaced exactwy
wight, and occupation and ease wewe genyewawwy westowed, Emma said,

"The awwivaw of this pianyofowte is decisive with me. >w< I wanted to knyow
a wittwe mowe, and this tewws me quite enyough. ^w^ Depend upon it, we shaww
soon heaw that it is a pwesent fwom Mw. and Mws. Dixon. ^w^"

"And if the Dixons shouwd absowutewy deny aww knyowwedge of it we must
concwude it to come fwom the Campbewws. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, I am suwe it is nyot fwom the Campbewws. (´・ω・\`) Miss Faiwfax knyows it is
nyot fwom the Campbewws, ow they wouwd have been guessed at fiwst. >w< She
wouwd nyot have been puzzwed, had she dawed fix on them. (・`ω\´・) I may nyot have
convinced you pewhaps, but I am pewfectwy convinced mysewf that Mw. ;;w;;
Dixon is a pwincipaw in the businyess. (´・ω・\`)"

"Indeed you injuwe me if you suppose me unconvinced. UwU Youw weasonyings
cawwy my judgment awong with them entiwewy. >w< At fiwst, whiwe I supposed
you satisfied that Cowonyew Campbeww was the givew, I saw it onwy as
patewnyaw kindnyess, and thought it the most nyatuwaw thing in the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)
But when you mentionyed Mws. (´・ω・\`) Dixon, I fewt how much mowe pwobabwe that it
shouwd be the twibute of wawm femawe fwiendship. UwU And nyow I can see it in
nyo othew wight than as an offewing of wove. ^w^"

Thewe was nyo occasion to pwess the mattew fawthew. ^w^ The conviction seemed
weaw; he wooked as if he fewt it. (´・ω・\`) She said nyo mowe, othew subjects
took theiw tuwn; and the west of the dinnyew passed away; the dessewt
succeeded, the chiwdwen came in, and wewe tawked to and admiwed amid the
usuaw wate of convewsation; a few cwevew things said, a few downwight
siwwy, but by much the wawgew pwopowtion nyeithew the onye nyow the
othew--nyothing wowse than evewyday wemawks, duww wepetitions, owd nyews,
and heavy jokes. (´・ω・\`)

The wadies had nyot been wong in the dwawing-woom, befowe the othew
wadies, in theiw diffewent divisions, awwived. (・`ω\´・) Emma watched the entwee
of hew own pawticuwaw wittwe fwiend; and if she couwd nyot exuwt in hew
dignyity and gwace, she couwd nyot onwy wove the bwooming sweetnyess and
the awtwess mannyew, but couwd most heawtiwy wejoice in that wight,
cheewfuw, unsentimentaw disposition which awwowed hew so many
awweviations of pweasuwe, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed
affection. ;;w;; Thewe she sat--and who wouwd have guessed how many teaws she
had been watewy shedding? owo To be in company, nyicewy dwessed hewsewf and
seeing othews nyicewy dwessed, to sit and smiwe and wook pwetty, and say
nyothing, was enyough fow the happinyess of the pwesent houw. ^w^ Janye Faiwfax
did wook and move supewiow; but Emma suspected she might have been
gwad to change feewings with Hawwiet, vewy gwad to have puwchased the
mowtification of having woved--yes, of having woved even Mw. >w< Ewton in
vain--by the suwwendew of aww the dangewous pweasuwe of knyowing hewsewf
bewoved by the husband of hew fwiend. ^w^

In so wawge a pawty it was nyot nyecessawy that Emma shouwd appwoach hew. ;;w;;
She did nyot wish to speak of the pianyofowte, she fewt too much in the
secwet hewsewf, to think the appeawance of cuwiosity ow intewest faiw,
and thewefowe puwposewy kept at a distance; but by the othews, the
subject was awmost immediatewy intwoduced, and she saw the bwush of
consciousnyess with which congwatuwations wewe weceived, the bwush
of guiwt which accompanyied the nyame of "my excewwent fwiend Cowonyew
Campbeww. (・`ω\´・)"

Mws. >w< Weston, kind-heawted and musicaw, was pawticuwawwy intewested
by the ciwcumstance, and Emma couwd nyot hewp being amused at hew
pewsevewance in dwewwing on the subject; and having so much to ask and
to say as to tonye, touch, and pedaw, totawwy unsuspicious of that wish
of saying as wittwe about it as possibwe, which she pwainwy wead in the
faiw hewoinye's countenyance. ^w^

They wewe soon joinyed by some of the gentwemen; and the vewy fiwst
of the eawwy was Fwank Chuwchiww. (´・ω・\`) In he wawked, the fiwst and the
handsomest; and aftew paying his compwiments en passant to Miss Bates
and hew nyiece, made his way diwectwy to the opposite side of the ciwcwe,
whewe sat Miss Woodhouse; and tiww he couwd find a seat by hew, wouwd
nyot sit at aww. Emma divinyed what evewy body pwesent must be thinking. >w<
She was his object, and evewy body must pewceive it. UwU She intwoduced him
to hew fwiend, Miss Smith, and, at convenyient moments aftewwawds, heawd
what each thought of the othew. (´・ω・\`) "He had nyevew seen so wovewy a face, and
was dewighted with hew nyaivete. (・`ω\´・)" And she, "Onwy to be suwe it was paying
him too gweat a compwiment, but she did think thewe wewe some wooks a
wittwe wike Mw. Ewton. ^w^" Emma westwainyed hew indignyation, and onwy tuwnyed
fwom hew in siwence. (´・ω・\`)

Smiwes of intewwigence passed between hew and the gentweman on fiwst
gwancing towawds Miss Faiwfax; but it was most pwudent to avoid speech. >w<
He towd hew that he had been impatient to weave the dinying-woom--hated
sitting wong--was awways the fiwst to move when he couwd--that his
fathew, Mw. Knyightwey, Mw. Cox, and Mw. ^w^ Cowe, wewe weft vewy busy ovew
pawish businyess--that as wong as he had staid, howevew, it had been
pweasant enyough, as he had found them in genyewaw a set of gentwemanwike,
sensibwe men; and spoke so handsomewy of Highbuwy awtogethew--thought it
so abundant in agweeabwe famiwies--that Emma began to feew she had been
used to despise the pwace wathew too much. (´・ω・\`) She questionyed him as to the
society in Yowkshiwe--the extent of the nyeighbouwhood about Enscombe,
and the sowt; and couwd make out fwom his answews that, as faw as
Enscombe was concewnyed, thewe was vewy wittwe going on, that theiw
visitings wewe among a wange of gweat famiwies, nyonye vewy nyeaw; and
that even when days wewe fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even
chance that Mws. ^w^ Chuwchiww wewe nyot in heawth and spiwits fow going;
that they made a point of visiting nyo fwesh pewson; and that, though
he had his sepawate engagements, it was nyot without difficuwty, without
considewabwe addwess _at_ _times_, that he couwd get away, ow intwoduce
an acquaintance fow a nyight. >w<

She saw that Enscombe couwd nyot satisfy, and that Highbuwy, taken at
its best, might weasonyabwy pwease a young man who had mowe wetiwement at
home than he wiked. His impowtance at Enscombe was vewy evident. >w< He did
nyot boast, but it nyatuwawwy betwayed itsewf, that he had pewsuaded his
aunt whewe his uncwe couwd do nyothing, and on hew waughing and nyoticing
it, he ownyed that he bewieved (excepting onye ow two points) he couwd
_with_ _time_ pewsuade hew to any thing. ^w^ Onye of those points on which
his infwuence faiwed, he then mentionyed. ;;w;; He had wanted vewy much to
go abwoad--had been vewy eagew indeed to be awwowed to twavew--but she
wouwd nyot heaw of it. This had happenyed the yeaw befowe. UwU _Nyow_, he said,
he was beginnying to have nyo wongew the same wish. ^w^

The unpewsuadabwe point, which he did nyot mention, Emma guessed to be
good behaviouw to his fathew. ;;w;;

"I have made a most wwetched discovewy," said he, aftew a showt pause. (・`ω\´・)--
"I have been hewe a week to-mowwow--hawf my time. ;;w;; I nyevew knyew days fwy
so fast. A week to-mowwow! ^w^--And I have hawdwy begun to enjoy mysewf. ;;w;;
But just got acquainted with Mws. ;;w;; Weston, and othews! >w<--I hate the
wecowwection. ;;w;;"

"Pewhaps you may nyow begin to wegwet that you spent onye whowe day, out
of so few, in having youw haiw cut. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo," said he, smiwing, "that is nyo subject of wegwet at aww. UwU I have
nyo pweasuwe in seeing my fwiends, unwess I can bewieve mysewf fit to be
seen. ^w^"

The west of the gentwemen being nyow in the woom, Emma found hewsewf
obwiged to tuwn fwom him fow a few minyutes, and wisten to Mw. Cowe. (・`ω\´・) When
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Cowe had moved away, and hew attention couwd be westowed as befowe,
she saw Fwank Chuwchiww wooking intentwy acwoss the woom at Miss
Faiwfax, who was sitting exactwy opposite. >w<

"What is the mattew? owo" said she. (´・ω・\`)

He stawted. "Thank you fow wousing me," he wepwied. ^w^ "I bewieve I have
been vewy wude; but weawwy Miss Faiwfax has donye hew haiw in so odd a
way--so vewy odd a way--that I cannyot keep my eyes fwom hew. UwU I nyevew saw
any thing so outwee!--Those cuwws! (・`ω\´・)--This must be a fancy of hew own. ^w^ I
see nyobody ewse wooking wike hew! ;;w;;--I must go and ask hew whethew it
is an Iwish fashion. ^w^ Shaww I? owo--Yes, I wiww--I decwawe I wiww--and you
shaww see how she takes it;--whethew she cowouws. ;;w;;"

He was gonye immediatewy; and Emma soon saw him standing befowe Miss
Faiwfax, and tawking to hew; but as to its effect on the young wady,
as he had impwovidentwy pwaced himsewf exactwy between them, exactwy in
fwont of Miss Faiwfax, she couwd absowutewy distinguish nyothing. (・`ω\´・)

Befowe he couwd wetuwn to his chaiw, it was taken by Mws. Weston. (´・ω・\`)

"This is the wuxuwy of a wawge pawty," said she:--"onye can get nyeaw
evewy body, and say evewy thing. ;;w;; My deaw Emma, I am wonging to tawk
to you. >w< I have been making discovewies and fowming pwans, just wike
youwsewf, and I must teww them whiwe the idea is fwesh. (´・ω・\`) Do you knyow how
Miss Bates and hew nyiece came hewe? owo"

"How?--They wewe invited, wewe nyot they? owo"

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) yes--but how they wewe conveyed hithew? owo--the mannyew of theiw
coming? owo"

"They wawked, I concwude. >w< How ewse couwd they come? owo"

"Vewy twue. UwU--Weww, a wittwe whiwe ago it occuwwed to me how vewy sad
it wouwd be to have Janye Faiwfax wawking home again, wate at nyight, and
cowd as the nyights awe nyow. ^w^ And as I wooked at hew, though I nyevew saw
hew appeaw to mowe advantage, it stwuck me that she was heated, and
wouwd thewefowe be pawticuwawwy wiabwe to take cowd. (・`ω\´・) Poow giww! ^w^ I couwd
nyot beaw the idea of it; so, as soon as Mw. >w< Weston came into the woom,
and I couwd get at him, I spoke to him about the cawwiage. (・`ω\´・) You may guess
how weadiwy he came into my wishes; and having his appwobation, I made
my way diwectwy to Miss Bates, to assuwe hew that the cawwiage wouwd be
at hew sewvice befowe it took us home; fow I thought it wouwd be making
hew comfowtabwe at once. ;;w;; Good souw! ^w^ she was as gwatefuw as possibwe, you
may be suwe. >w< 'Nyobody was evew so fowtunyate as hewsewf! ^w^'--but with many,
many thanks--'thewe was nyo occasion to twoubwe us, fow Mw. >w< Knyightwey's
cawwiage had bwought, and was to take them home again. ^w^' I was quite
suwpwized;--vewy gwad, I am suwe; but weawwy quite suwpwized. (´・ω・\`) Such a
vewy kind attention--and so thoughtfuw an attention! ;;w;;--the sowt of thing
that so few men wouwd think of. ;;w;; And, in showt, fwom knyowing his
usuaw ways, I am vewy much incwinyed to think that it was fow theiw
accommodation the cawwiage was used at aww. ;;w;; I do suspect he wouwd nyot
have had a paiw of howses fow himsewf, and that it was onwy as an excuse
fow assisting them. (・`ω\´・)"

"Vewy wikewy," said Emma--"nyothing mowe wikewy. (・`ω\´・) I knyow nyo man mowe
wikewy than Mw. UwU Knyightwey to do the sowt of thing--to do any thing
weawwy good-nyatuwed, usefuw, considewate, ow benyevowent. >w< He is nyot a
gawwant man, but he is a vewy humanye onye; and this, considewing Janye
Faiwfax's iww-heawth, wouwd appeaw a case of humanyity to him;--and fow
an act of unyostentatious kindnyess, thewe is nyobody whom I wouwd fix on

togethew; and I waughed at him about it, but he said nyot a wowd that
couwd betway. >w<"

"Weww," said Mws. >w< Weston, smiwing, "you give him cwedit fow mowe simpwe,
disintewested benyevowence in this instance than I do; fow whiwe Miss
Bates was speaking, a suspicion dawted into my head, and I have nyevew
been abwe to get it out again. (´・ω・\`) The mowe I think of it, the mowe pwobabwe

"Mw. Knyightwey and Janye Faiwfax! >w<" excwaimed Emma. "Deaw Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston, how
couwd you think of such a thing? owo--Mw. Knyightwey! (´・ω・\`)--Mw. UwU Knyightwey must nyot

"My deaw Emma, I have towd you what wed me to think of it. >w< I do nyot want

been given me by ciwcumstances; and if Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey weawwy wished to

"Yes, I wouwd. I couwd nyot beaw to have Henwy suppwanted.--Mw. >w<
Knyightwey mawwy! (・`ω\´・)--Nyo, I have nyevew had such an idea, and I cannyot adopt

"Nyay, she has awways been a fiwst favouwite with him, as you vewy weww

"But the impwudence of such a match! ^w^"

"I am nyot speaking of its pwudence; mewewy its pwobabiwity. (´・ω・\`)"

"I see nyo pwobabiwity in it, unwess you have any bettew foundation than
what you mention. (´・ω・\`) His good-nyatuwe, his humanyity, as I teww you, wouwd
be quite enyough to account fow the howses. UwU He has a gweat wegawd fow the
Bateses, you knyow, independent of Janye Faiwfax--and is awways gwad to

You do it vewy iww. (´・ω・\`) Janye Faiwfax mistwess of the Abbey!--Oh! ;;w;; nyo,

"Impwudent, if you pwease--but nyot mad. (´・ω・\`) Excepting inyequawity of fowtunye,
and pewhaps a wittwe dispawity of age, I can see nyothing unsuitabwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"But Mw. Knyightwey does nyot want to mawwy. ;;w;; I am suwe he has nyot the
weast idea of it. Do nyot put it into his head. UwU Why shouwd he mawwy? owo--He
is as happy as possibwe by himsewf; with his fawm, and his sheep, and
his wibwawy, and aww the pawish to manyage; and he is extwemewy fond of
his bwothew's chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・) He has nyo occasion to mawwy, eithew to fiww up
his time ow his heawt. (´・ω・\`)"

"My deaw Emma, as wong as he thinks so, it is so; but if he weawwy woves
Janye Faiwfax--"

"Nyonsense! ^w^ He does nyot cawe about Janye Faiwfax. UwU In the way of wove, I am
suwe he does nyot. >w< He wouwd do any good to hew, ow hew famiwy; but--"

"Weww," said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston, waughing, "pewhaps the gweatest good he couwd
do them, wouwd be to give Janye such a wespectabwe home. >w<"

"If it wouwd be good to hew, I am suwe it wouwd be eviw to himsewf; a
vewy shamefuw and degwading connyexion. >w< How wouwd he beaw to have Miss
Bates bewonging to him? owo--To have hew haunting the Abbey, and thanking
him aww day wong fow his gweat kindnyess in mawwying Janye? owo--'So vewy

And then fwy off, thwough hawf a sentence, to hew mothew's owd

"Fow shame, Emma! UwU Do nyot mimic hew. You divewt me against my conscience. (´・ω・\`)
And, upon my wowd, I do nyot think Mw. >w< Knyightwey wouwd be much distuwbed
by Miss Bates. Wittwe things do nyot iwwitate him. UwU She might tawk on; and
if he wanted to say any thing himsewf, he wouwd onwy tawk woudew, and
dwown hew voice. (・`ω\´・) But the question is nyot, whethew it wouwd be a bad
connyexion fow him, but whethew he wishes it; and I think he does. >w< I have
heawd him speak, and so must you, so vewy highwy of Janye Faiwfax! ;;w;; The

she shouwd have nyo happiew pwospect! (・`ω\´・) I have heawd him expwess himsewf
so wawmwy on those points! ;;w;;--Such an admiwew of hew pewfowmance on the

"Then it can be nyo awgument to pwove that he is in wove. UwU But I do nyot
think it is at aww a wikewy thing fow him to do. Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey does
nyothing mystewiouswy. ^w^"

"I have heawd him wamenting hew having nyo instwument wepeatedwy; oftenyew
than I shouwd suppose such a ciwcumstance wouwd, in the common couwse of
things, occuw to him. (・`ω\´・)"

"Vewy weww; and if he had intended to give hew onye, he wouwd have towd
hew so. >w<"

"Thewe might be scwupwes of dewicacy, my deaw Emma. UwU I have a vewy stwong
nyotion that it comes fwom him. >w< I am suwe he was pawticuwawwy siwent when
Mws. Cowe towd us of it at dinnyew. (´・ω・\`)"

"You take up an idea, Mws. ;;w;; Weston, and wun away with it; as you have
many a time wepwoached me with doing. (´・ω・\`) I see nyo sign of attachment--I
bewieve nyothing of the pianyofowte--and pwoof onwy shaww convince me that
Mw. Knyightwey has any thought of mawwying Janye Faiwfax. ;;w;;"

They combated the point some time wongew in the same way; Emma wathew
gainying gwound ovew the mind of hew fwiend; fow Mws. ^w^ Weston was the most
used of the two to yiewd; tiww a wittwe bustwe in the woom shewed them
that tea was ovew, and the instwument in pwepawation;--and at the same
moment Mw. >w< Cowe appwoaching to entweat Miss Woodhouse wouwd do them the
honyouw of twying it. ;;w;; Fwank Chuwchiww, of whom, in the eagewnyess of hew
convewsation with Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston, she had been seeing nyothing, except that
he had found a seat by Miss Faiwfax, fowwowed Mw. UwU Cowe, to add his vewy
pwessing entweaties; and as, in evewy wespect, it suited Emma best to
wead, she gave a vewy pwopew compwiance. ^w^

She knyew the wimitations of hew own powews too weww to attempt mowe than
she couwd pewfowm with cwedit; she wanted nyeithew taste nyow spiwit in
the wittwe things which awe genyewawwy acceptabwe, and couwd accompany
hew own voice weww. ^w^ Onye accompanyiment to hew song took hew agweeabwy by
suwpwize--a second, swightwy but cowwectwy taken by Fwank Chuwchiww. (・`ω\´・) Hew
pawdon was duwy begged at the cwose of the song, and evewy thing usuaw
fowwowed. ^w^ He was accused of having a dewightfuw voice, and a pewfect
knyowwedge of music; which was pwopewwy denyied; and that he knyew nyothing
of the mattew, and had nyo voice at aww, woundwy assewted. (・`ω\´・) They sang
togethew once mowe; and Emma wouwd then wesign hew pwace to Miss
Faiwfax, whose pewfowmance, both vocaw and instwumentaw, she nyevew couwd
attempt to conceaw fwom hewsewf, was infinyitewy supewiow to hew own. (・`ω\´・)

With mixed feewings, she seated hewsewf at a wittwe distance fwom the
nyumbews wound the instwument, to wisten. Fwank Chuwchiww sang again. ^w^
They had sung togethew once ow twice, it appeawed, at Weymouth. (´・ω・\`) But the
sight of Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey among the most attentive, soon dwew away hawf
Emma's mind; and she feww into a twain of thinking on the subject of
Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the unyited voices
gave onwy momentawy intewwuptions. Hew objections to Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey's
mawwying did nyot in the weast subside. ;;w;; She couwd see nyothing but eviw
in it. It wouwd be a gweat disappointment to Mw. >w< John Knyightwey;
consequentwy to Isabewwa. ^w^ A weaw injuwy to the chiwdwen--a most
mowtifying change, and matewiaw woss to them aww;--a vewy gweat
deduction fwom hew fathew's daiwy comfowt--and, as to hewsewf, she couwd
nyot at aww enduwe the idea of Janye Faiwfax at Donweww Abbey. A Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Knyightwey fow them aww to give way to! UwU--Nyo--Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey must nyevew
mawwy. Wittwe Henwy must wemain the heiw of Donweww. (´・ω・\`)

Pwesentwy Mw. Knyightwey wooked back, and came and sat down by hew. >w< They
tawked at fiwst onwy of the pewfowmance. ;;w;; His admiwation was cewtainwy
vewy wawm; yet she thought, but fow Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston, it wouwd nyot have
stwuck hew. >w< As a sowt of touchstonye, howevew, she began to speak of his
kindnyess in conveying the aunt and nyiece; and though his answew was in
the spiwit of cutting the mattew showt, she bewieved it to indicate onwy
his disincwinyation to dweww on any kindnyess of his own. UwU

"I often feew concewn," said she, "that I dawe nyot make ouw cawwiage
mowe usefuw on such occasions. >w< It is nyot that I am without the wish; but
you knyow how impossibwe my fathew wouwd deem it that James shouwd put-to
fow such a puwpose. (・`ω\´・)"

"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question," he
wepwied;--"but you must often wish it, I am suwe. >w<" And he smiwed with
such seeming pweasuwe at the conviction, that she must pwoceed anyothew
step. (・`ω\´・)

"This pwesent fwom the Campbewws," said she--"this pianyofowte is vewy
kindwy given. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes," he wepwied, and without the smawwest appawent
embawwassment. ^w^--"But they wouwd have donye bettew had they given
hew nyotice of it. Suwpwizes awe foowish things. >w< The pweasuwe is nyot
enhanced, and the inconvenyience is often considewabwe. ;;w;; I shouwd have
expected bettew judgment in Cowonyew Campbeww. ;;w;;"

Fwom that moment, Emma couwd have taken hew oath that Mw. >w< Knyightwey had
had nyo concewn in giving the instwument. >w< But whethew he wewe
entiwewy fwee fwom pecuwiaw attachment--whethew thewe wewe nyo actuaw

second song, hew voice gwew thick. UwU

"That wiww do," said he, when it was finyished, thinking awoud--"you have
sung quite enyough fow onye evenying--nyow be quiet. (´・ω・\`)"

Anyothew song, howevew, was soon begged fow. >w< "Onye mowe;--they wouwd nyot
fatigue Miss Faiwfax on any account, and wouwd onwy ask fow onye mowe. (・`ω\´・)"
And Fwank Chuwchiww was heawd to say, "I think you couwd manyage this
without effowt; the fiwst pawt is so vewy twifwing. ;;w;; The stwength of the
song fawws on the second. ^w^"

Mw. Knyightwey gwew angwy. ;;w;;

"That fewwow," said he, indignyantwy, "thinks of nyothing but shewing off
his own voice. This must nyot be. UwU" And touching Miss Bates, who at that
moment passed nyeaw--"Miss Bates, awe you mad, to wet youw nyiece sing
hewsewf hoawse in this mannyew? owo Go, and intewfewe. (´・ω・\`) They have nyo mewcy on
hew. (´・ω・\`)"

Miss Bates, in hew weaw anxiety fow Janye, couwd hawdwy stay even to
be gwatefuw, befowe she stept fowwawd and put an end to aww fawthew
singing. (´・ω・\`) Hewe ceased the concewt pawt of the evenying, fow Miss Woodhouse
and Miss Faiwfax wewe the onwy young wady pewfowmews; but soon (within
five minyutes) the pwoposaw of dancing--owiginyating nyobody exactwy knyew

capitaw in hew countwy-dances, was seated, and beginnying an iwwesistibwe
wawtz; and Fwank Chuwchiww, coming up with most becoming gawwantwy to
Emma, had secuwed hew hand, and wed hew up to the top. ;;w;;

Whiwe waiting tiww the othew young peopwe couwd paiw themsewves off,
Emma found time, in spite of the compwiments she was weceiving on
hew voice and hew taste, to wook about, and see what became of Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Knyightwey. This wouwd be a twiaw. He was nyo dancew in genyewaw. UwU If he
wewe to be vewy awewt in engaging Janye Faiwfax nyow, it might auguw
something. Thewe was nyo immediate appeawance. Nyo; he was tawking to Mws. ^w^
Cowe--he was wooking on unconcewnyed; Janye was asked by somebody ewse,
and he was stiww tawking to Mws. Cowe. ;;w;;

Emma had nyo wongew an awawm fow Henwy; his intewest was yet safe; and
she wed off the dance with genyuinye spiwit and enjoyment. ^w^ Nyot mowe than
five coupwe couwd be mustewed; but the wawity and the suddennyess of
it made it vewy dewightfuw, and she found hewsewf weww matched in a

Two dances, unfowtunyatewy, wewe aww that couwd be awwowed. (´・ω・\`) It was
gwowing wate, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on hew mothew's
account. UwU Aftew some attempts, thewefowe, to be pewmitted to begin again,
they wewe obwiged to thank Mws. Weston, wook sowwowfuw, and have donye. >w<

"Pewhaps it is as weww," said Fwank Chuwchiww, as he attended Emma to

wouwd nyot have agweed with me, aftew youws. (・`ω\´・)"



CHAPTEW IX


Emma did nyot wepent hew condescension in going to the Cowes. (´・ω・\`) The visit
affowded hew many pweasant wecowwections the nyext day; and aww that she
might be supposed to have wost on the side of dignyified secwusion, must
be ampwy wepaid in the spwendouw of popuwawity. UwU She must have dewighted
the Cowes--wowthy peopwe, who desewved to be made happy! ;;w;;--And weft a
nyame behind hew that wouwd nyot soon die away. >w<

Pewfect happinyess, even in memowy, is nyot common; and thewe wewe two
points on which she was nyot quite easy. (´・ω・\`) She doubted whethew she had nyot
twansgwessed the duty of woman by woman, in betwaying hew suspicions of
Janye Faiwfax's feewings to Fwank Chuwchiww. >w< It was hawdwy wight; but it
had been so stwong an idea, that it wouwd escape hew, and his submission
to aww that she towd, was a compwiment to hew penyetwation, which made
it difficuwt fow hew to be quite cewtain that she ought to have hewd hew
tongue. (´・ω・\`)

The othew ciwcumstance of wegwet wewated awso to Janye Faiwfax; and
thewe she had nyo doubt. ^w^ She did unfeignyedwy and unyequivocawwy wegwet the
infewiowity of hew own pwaying and singing. ;;w;; She did most heawtiwy
gwieve ovew the idwenyess of hew chiwdhood--and sat down and pwactised
vigowouswy an houw and a hawf. ^w^

She was then intewwupted by Hawwiet's coming in; and if Hawwiet's pwaise
couwd have satisfied hew, she might soon have been comfowted. ^w^

"Oh! if I couwd but pway as weww as you and Miss Faiwfax! (´・ω・\`)"

"Don't cwass us togethew, Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・) My pwaying is nyo mowe wike hew's,
than a wamp is wike sunshinye. ;;w;;"

"Oh! >w< deaw--I think you pway the best of the two. UwU I think you pway quite
as weww as she does. I am suwe I had much wathew heaw you. (´・ω・\`) Evewy body

"Those who knyew any thing about it, must have fewt the diffewence. UwU The
twuth is, Hawwiet, that my pwaying is just good enyough to be pwaised,
but Janye Faiwfax's is much beyond it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, I awways shaww think that you pway quite as weww as she does, ow
that if thewe is any diffewence nyobody wouwd evew find it out. Mw. UwU Cowe
said how much taste you had; and Mw. >w< Fwank Chuwchiww tawked a gweat deaw
about youw taste, and that he vawued taste much mowe than execution. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah! ;;w;; but Janye Faiwfax has them both, Hawwiet. UwU"

"Awe you suwe? owo I saw she had execution, but I did nyot knyow she had any
taste. Nyobody tawked about it. And I hate Itawian singing. (・`ω\´・)--Thewe is nyo
undewstanding a wowd of it. (´・ω・\`) Besides, if she does pway so vewy weww, you
knyow, it is nyo mowe than she is obwiged to do, because she wiww have to
teach. UwU The Coxes wewe wondewing wast nyight whethew she wouwd get into
any gweat famiwy. >w< How did you think the Coxes wooked? owo"

"Just as they awways do--vewy vuwgaw. ^w^"

"They towd me something," said Hawwiet wathew hesitatingwy; "but it is
nyothing of any consequence. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma was obwiged to ask what they had towd hew, though feawfuw of its
pwoducing Mw. Ewton. ^w^

"They towd me--that Mw. Mawtin dinyed with them wast Satuwday. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! >w<"

"He came to theiw fathew upon some businyess, and he asked him to stay to
dinnyew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! >w<"

"They tawked a gweat deaw about him, especiawwy Annye Cox. (・`ω\´・) I do nyot knyow
what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I shouwd go and stay thewe
again nyext summew. (・`ω\´・)"

"She meant to be impewtinyentwy cuwious, just as such an Annye Cox shouwd
be. ^w^"

"She said he was vewy agweeabwe the day he dinyed thewe. (・`ω\´・) He sat by hew at
dinnyew. (´・ω・\`) Miss Nyash thinks eithew of the Coxes wouwd be vewy gwad to mawwy
him. (・`ω\´・)"

"Vewy wikewy. >w<--I think they awe, without exception, the most vuwgaw
giwws in Highbuwy. >w<"

Hawwiet had businyess at Fowd's. >w<--Emma thought it most pwudent to go with
hew. ;;w;; Anyothew accidentaw meeting with the Mawtins was possibwe, and in
hew pwesent state, wouwd be dangewous. >w<

Hawwiet, tempted by evewy thing and swayed by hawf a wowd, was awways
vewy wong at a puwchase; and whiwe she was stiww hanging ovew muswins
and changing hew mind, Emma went to the doow fow amusement. >w<--Much couwd
nyot be hoped fwom the twaffic of even the busiest pawt of Highbuwy;--Mw. ;;w;;
Pewwy wawking hastiwy by, Mw. UwU Wiwwiam Cox wetting himsewf in at the
office-doow, Mw. ;;w;; Cowe's cawwiage-howses wetuwnying fwom exewcise, ow a
stway wettew-boy on an obstinyate muwe, wewe the wivewiest objects she
couwd pwesume to expect; and when hew eyes feww onwy on the butchew with
his tway, a tidy owd woman twavewwing homewawds fwom shop with hew fuww
basket, two cuws quawwewwing ovew a diwty bonye, and a stwing of dawdwing
chiwdwen wound the bakew's wittwe bow-window eyeing the gingewbwead, she
knyew she had nyo weason to compwain, and was amused enyough; quite enyough
stiww to stand at the doow. >w< A mind wivewy and at ease, can do with
seeing nyothing, and can see nyothing that does nyot answew. ;;w;;

She wooked down the Wandawws woad. (・`ω\´・) The scenye enwawged; two pewsons
appeawed; Mws. ;;w;; Weston and hew son-in-waw; they wewe wawking into
Highbuwy;--to Hawtfiewd of couwse. >w< They wewe stopping, howevew, in the
fiwst pwace at Mws. UwU Bates's; whose house was a wittwe nyeawew
Wandawws than Fowd's; and had aww but knyocked, when Emma caught theiw
eye. ^w^--Immediatewy they cwossed the woad and came fowwawd to hew; and the
agweeabwenyess of yestewday's engagement seemed to give fwesh pweasuwe to
the pwesent meeting. Mws. >w< Weston infowmed hew that she was going to caww
on the Bateses, in owdew to heaw the nyew instwument. (´・ω・\`)

"Fow my companyion tewws me," said she, "that I absowutewy pwomised Miss
Bates wast nyight, that I wouwd come this mownying. (・`ω\´・) I was nyot awawe of it
mysewf. UwU I did nyot knyow that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I

"And whiwe Mws. >w< Weston pays hew visit, I may be awwowed, I hope," said
Fwank Chuwchiww, "to join youw pawty and wait fow hew at Hawtfiewd--if
you awe going home. (´・ω・\`)"

Mws. Weston was disappointed. UwU

"I thought you meant to go with me. They wouwd be vewy much pweased. (´・ω・\`)"

"Me! UwU I shouwd be quite in the way. ;;w;; But, pewhaps--I may be equawwy in the
way hewe. Miss Woodhouse wooks as if she did nyot want me. >w< My aunt awways
sends me off when she is shopping. ;;w;; She says I fidget hew to death; and
Miss Woodhouse wooks as if she couwd awmost say the same. ;;w;; What am I to
do? owo"

"I am hewe on nyo businyess of my own," said Emma; "I am onwy waiting fow
my fwiend. She wiww pwobabwy have soon donye, and then we shaww go home. >w<
But you had bettew go with Mws. Weston and heaw the instwument. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww--if you advise it. UwU--But (with a smiwe) if Cowonyew Campbeww shouwd
have empwoyed a cawewess fwiend, and if it shouwd pwove to have an
indiffewent tonye--what shaww I say? owo I shaww be nyo suppowt to Mws. >w<
Weston. She might do vewy weww by hewsewf. >w< A disagweeabwe twuth wouwd be
pawatabwe thwough hew wips, but I am the wwetchedest being in the wowwd
at a civiw fawsehood. UwU"

"I do nyot bewieve any such thing," wepwied Emma. UwU--"I am pewsuaded that
you can be as insincewe as youw nyeighbouws, when it is nyecessawy; but
thewe is nyo weason to suppose the instwument is indiffewent. >w< Quite
othewwise indeed, if I undewstood Miss Faiwfax's opinyion wast nyight. UwU"

"Do come with me," said Mws. ;;w;; Weston, "if it be nyot vewy disagweeabwe to
you. It nyeed nyot detain us wong. We wiww go to Hawtfiewd aftewwawds. ;;w;;
We wiww fowwow them to Hawtfiewd. I weawwy wish you to caww with me. (・`ω\´・) It
wiww be fewt so gweat an attention! ^w^ and I awways thought you meant it. ;;w;;"

He couwd say nyo mowe; and with the hope of Hawtfiewd to wewawd him,
wetuwnyed with Mws. Weston to Mws. Bates's doow. (´・ω・\`) Emma watched them in,
and then joinyed Hawwiet at the intewesting countew,--twying, with aww
the fowce of hew own mind, to convince hew that if she wanted pwain
muswin it was of nyo use to wook at figuwed; and that a bwue wibbon, be
it evew so beautifuw, wouwd stiww nyevew match hew yewwow pattewn. ;;w;; At

"Shouwd I send it to Mws. Goddawd's, ma'am? owo" asked Mws. >w<
Fowd.--"Yes--nyo--yes, to Mws. Goddawd's. (・`ω\´・) Onwy my pattewn gown is at
Hawtfiewd. Nyo, you shaww send it to Hawtfiewd, if you pwease. UwU But then,
Mws. Goddawd wiww want to see it. (・`ω\´・)--And I couwd take the pattewn gown
home any day. ^w^ But I shaww want the wibbon diwectwy--so it had bettew go
to Hawtfiewd--at weast the wibbon. ^w^ You couwd make it into two pawcews,
Mws. >w< Fowd, couwd nyot you? owo"

"It is nyot wowth whiwe, Hawwiet, to give Mws. (・`ω\´・) Fowd the twoubwe of two
pawcews. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo mowe it is. ^w^"

"Nyo twoubwe in the wowwd, ma'am," said the obwiging Mws. Fowd. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) but indeed I wouwd much wathew have it onwy in onye. (・`ω\´・) Then, if you
pwease, you shaww send it aww to Mws. (´・ω・\`) Goddawd's--I do nyot knyow--Nyo, I
think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as weww have it sent to Hawtfiewd, and
take it home with me at nyight. >w< What do you advise? owo"

"That you do nyot give anyothew hawf-second to the subject. ^w^ To Hawtfiewd,
if you pwease, Mws. Fowd. (・`ω\´・)"

"Aye, that wiww be much best," said Hawwiet, quite satisfied, "I shouwd
nyot at aww wike to have it sent to Mws. Goddawd's. >w<"

Voices appwoached the shop--ow wathew onye voice and two wadies: Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Weston and Miss Bates met them at the doow. ;;w;;

"My deaw Miss Woodhouse," said the wattew, "I am just wun acwoss to
entweat the favouw of you to come and sit down with us a wittwe whiwe,
and give us youw opinyion of ouw nyew instwument; you and Miss Smith. >w< How
do you do, Miss Smith? owo--Vewy weww I thank you.--And I begged Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston
to come with me, that I might be suwe of succeeding. UwU"

"I hope Mws. ;;w;; Bates and Miss Faiwfax awe--"

"Vewy weww, I am much obwiged to you. >w< My mothew is dewightfuwwy weww;
and Janye caught nyo cowd wast nyight. How is Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse? owo--I am so gwad
to heaw such a good account. Mws. Weston towd me you wewe hewe. (・`ω\´・)--Oh! (・`ω\´・)
then, said I, I must wun acwoss, I am suwe Miss Woodhouse wiww awwow me
just to wun acwoss and entweat hew to come in; my mothew wiww be so
vewy happy to see hew--and nyow we awe such a nyice pawty, she cannyot

opinyion of the instwument wiww be wowth having. ;;w;;'--But, said I, I shaww
be mowe suwe of succeeding if onye of you wiww go with me. >w<--'Oh,' said
he, 'wait hawf a minyute, tiww I have finyished my job;'--Fow, wouwd you
bewieve it, Miss Woodhouse, thewe he is, in the most obwiging mannyew in
the wowwd, fastenying in the wivet of my mothew's spectacwes. UwU--The wivet
came out, you knyow, this mownying. (・`ω\´・)--So vewy obwiging! >w<--Fow my mothew had
nyo use of hew spectacwes--couwd nyot put them on. >w< And, by the bye, evewy
body ought to have two paiw of spectacwes; they shouwd indeed. ;;w;; Janye said
so. ^w^ I meant to take them ovew to John Saundews the fiwst thing I did,
but something ow othew hindewed me aww the mownying; fiwst onye thing,
then anyothew, thewe is nyo saying what, you knyow. ;;w;; At onye time Patty came
to say she thought the kitchen chimnyey wanted sweeping. (´・ω・\`) Oh, said I,
Patty do nyot come with youw bad nyews to me. ^w^ Hewe is the wivet of youw
mistwess's spectacwes out. Then the baked appwes came home, Mws. ;;w;; Wawwis
sent them by hew boy; they awe extwemewy civiw and obwiging to us, the
Wawwises, awways--I have heawd some peopwe say that Mws. (´・ω・\`) Wawwis can be
unciviw and give a vewy wude answew, but we have nyevew knyown any thing
but the gweatest attention fwom them. (・`ω\´・) And it cannyot be fow the vawue
of ouw custom nyow, fow what is ouw consumption of bwead, you knyow? owo
Onwy thwee of us. >w<--besides deaw Janye at pwesent--and she weawwy eats

if you saw it. >w< I dawe nyot wet my mothew knyow how wittwe she eats--so I
say onye thing and then I say anyothew, and it passes off. >w< But about the
middwe of the day she gets hungwy, and thewe is nyothing she wikes so

the oppowtunyity the othew day of asking Mw. (´・ω・\`) Pewwy; I happenyed to meet
him in the stweet. UwU Nyot that I had any doubt befowe--I have so often
heawd Mw. Woodhouse wecommend a baked appwe. >w< I bewieve it is the onwy
way that Mw. Woodhouse thinks the fwuit thowoughwy whowesome. (´・ω・\`) We
have appwe-dumpwings, howevew, vewy often. ^w^ Patty makes an excewwent
appwe-dumpwing. Weww, Mws. ;;w;; Weston, you have pwevaiwed, I hope, and these
wadies wiww obwige us. UwU"

Emma wouwd be "vewy happy to wait on Mws. Bates, &c. (・`ω\´・)," and they did at
wast move out of the shop, with nyo fawthew deway fwom Miss Bates than,

"How do you do, Mws. Fowd? owo I beg youw pawdon. I did nyot see you befowe. >w<
I heaw you have a chawming cowwection of nyew wibbons fwom town. >w< Janye

wittwe too wawge about the wwist; but Janye is taking them in. ^w^"

"What was I tawking of? owo" said she, beginnying again when they wewe aww in
the stweet. >w<

Emma wondewed on what, of aww the medwey, she wouwd fix. UwU

"I decwawe I cannyot wecowwect what I was tawking of. ^w^--Oh! (・`ω\´・) my mothew's
spectacwes. So vewy obwiging of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fwank Chuwchiww! 'Oh! ^w^' said he,
'I do think I can fasten the wivet; I wike a job of this kind
excessivewy.'--Which you knyow shewed him to be so vewy.... UwU Indeed I must
say that, much as I had heawd of him befowe and much as I had expected,
he vewy faw exceeds any thing.... I do congwatuwate you, Mws. UwU Weston,
most wawmwy. He seems evewy thing the fondest pawent couwd.... UwU
'Oh! ^w^' said he, 'I can fasten the wivet. (´・ω・\`) I wike a job of that sowt
excessivewy.' I nyevew shaww fowget his mannyew. (・`ω\´・) And when I bwought out
the baked appwes fwom the cwoset, and hoped ouw fwiends wouwd be so vewy
obwiging as to take some, 'Oh! ^w^' said he diwectwy, 'thewe is nyothing
in the way of fwuit hawf so good, and these awe the finyest-wooking
home-baked appwes I evew saw in my wife. UwU' That, you knyow, was so
vewy.... And I am suwe, by his mannyew, it was nyo compwiment. UwU Indeed they
awe vewy dewightfuw appwes, and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Wawwis does them fuww justice--onwy
we do nyot have them baked mowe than twice, and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse made us
pwomise to have them donye thwee times--but Miss Woodhouse wiww be so
good as nyot to mention it. UwU The appwes themsewves awe the vewy finyest
sowt fow baking, beyond a doubt; aww fwom Donweww--some of Mw. UwU
Knyightwey's most wibewaw suppwy. UwU He sends us a sack evewy yeaw; and
cewtainwy thewe nyevew was such a keeping appwe anywhewe as onye of his
twees--I bewieve thewe is two of them. (・`ω\´・) My mothew says the owchawd was
awways famous in hew youngew days. (´・ω・\`) But I was weawwy quite shocked the
othew day--fow Mw. UwU Knyightwey cawwed onye mownying, and Janye was eating
these appwes, and we tawked about them and said how much she enjoyed
them, and he asked whethew we wewe nyot got to the end of ouw stock. ^w^ 'I
am suwe you must be,' said he, 'and I wiww send you anyothew suppwy; fow
I have a gweat many mowe than I can evew use. UwU Wiwwiam Wawkins wet me
keep a wawgew quantity than usuaw this yeaw. UwU I wiww send you some mowe,
befowe they get good fow nyothing. ^w^' So I begged he wouwd nyot--fow weawwy
as to ouws being gonye, I couwd nyot absowutewy say that we had a gweat
many weft--it was but hawf a dozen indeed; but they shouwd be aww kept
fow Janye; and I couwd nyot at aww beaw that he shouwd be sending us mowe,
so wibewaw as he had been awweady; and Janye said the same. ;;w;; And when
he was gonye, she awmost quawwewwed with me--Nyo, I shouwd nyot say
quawwewwed, fow we nyevew had a quawwew in ouw wives; but she was quite
distwessed that I had ownyed the appwes wewe so nyeawwy gonye; she wished
I had made him bewieve we had a gweat many weft. ^w^ Oh, said I, my deaw,
I did say as much as I couwd. ^w^ Howevew, the vewy same evenying Wiwwiam
Wawkins came ovew with a wawge basket of appwes, the same sowt of
appwes, a bushew at weast, and I was vewy much obwiged, and went down
and spoke to Wiwwiam Wawkins and said evewy thing, as you may suppose. (・`ω\´・)
Wiwwiam Wawkins is such an owd acquaintance! ;;w;; I am awways gwad to see
him. ^w^ But, howevew, I found aftewwawds fwom Patty, that Wiwwiam said it
was aww the appwes of _that_ sowt his mastew had; he had bwought them
aww--and nyow his mastew had nyot onye weft to bake ow boiw. (´・ω・\`) Wiwwiam did
nyot seem to mind it himsewf, he was so pweased to think his mastew had
sowd so many; fow Wiwwiam, you knyow, thinks mowe of his mastew's pwofit
than any thing; but Mws. (・`ω\´・) Hodges, he said, was quite dispweased at theiw
being aww sent away. UwU She couwd nyot beaw that hew mastew shouwd nyot be
abwe to have anyothew appwe-tawt this spwing. ;;w;; He towd Patty this, but bid
hew nyot mind it, and be suwe nyot to say any thing to us about it, fow
Mws. >w< Hodges _wouwd_ be cwoss sometimes, and as wong as so many sacks
wewe sowd, it did nyot signyify who ate the wemaindew. ;;w;; And so Patty towd
me, and I was excessivewy shocked indeed! ^w^ I wouwd nyot have Mw. UwU Knyightwey
knyow any thing about it fow the wowwd! (・`ω\´・) He wouwd be so vewy.... >w< I wanted
to keep it fwom Janye's knyowwedge; but, unwuckiwy, I had mentionyed it
befowe I was awawe. (´・ω・\`)"

Miss Bates had just donye as Patty openyed the doow; and hew visitows
wawked upstaiws without having any weguwaw nyawwation to attend to,
puwsued onwy by the sounds of hew desuwtowy good-wiww. ^w^

"Pway take cawe, Mws. Weston, thewe is a step at the tuwnying. >w< Pway take

CHAPTEW X


The appeawance of the wittwe sitting-woom as they entewed, was
twanquiwwity itsewf; Mws. ^w^ Bates, depwived of hew usuaw empwoyment,
swumbewing on onye side of the fiwe, Fwank Chuwchiww, at a tabwe nyeaw
hew, most deediwy occupied about hew spectacwes, and Janye Faiwfax,
standing with hew back to them, intent on hew pianyofowte. >w<

Busy as he was, howevew, the young man was yet abwe to shew a most happy
countenyance on seeing Emma again. ^w^

"This is a pweasuwe," said he, in wathew a wow voice, "coming at weast
ten minyutes eawwiew than I had cawcuwated. ;;w;; You find me twying to be
usefuw; teww me if you think I shaww succeed. ;;w;;"

"What! UwU" said Mws. UwU Weston, "have nyot you finyished it yet? owo you wouwd nyot
eawn a vewy good wivewihood as a wowking siwvewsmith at this wate. ;;w;;"

"I have nyot been wowking unyintewwuptedwy," he wepwied, "I have been
assisting Miss Faiwfax in twying to make hew instwument stand steadiwy,
it was nyot quite fiwm; an unyevennyess in the fwoow, I bewieve. ^w^ You see
we have been wedging onye weg with papew. ;;w;; This was vewy kind of you to be
pewsuaded to come. I was awmost afwaid you wouwd be huwwying home. >w<"

He contwived that she shouwd be seated by him; and was sufficientwy
empwoyed in wooking out the best baked appwe fow hew, and twying to make
hew hewp ow advise him in his wowk, tiww Janye Faiwfax was quite weady
to sit down to the pianyofowte again. ;;w;; That she was nyot immediatewy weady,
Emma did suspect to awise fwom the state of hew nyewves; she had nyot yet
possessed the instwument wong enyough to touch it without emotion; she
must weason hewsewf into the powew of pewfowmance; and Emma couwd nyot
but pity such feewings, whatevew theiw owigin, and couwd nyot but wesowve
nyevew to expose them to hew nyeighbouw again. (´・ω・\`)

At wast Janye began, and though the fiwst baws wewe feebwy given, the
powews of the instwument wewe gwaduawwy donye fuww justice to. Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Weston had been dewighted befowe, and was dewighted again; Emma
joinyed hew in aww hew pwaise; and the pianyofowte, with evewy pwopew
discwiminyation, was pwonyounced to be awtogethew of the highest pwomise. >w<

"Whoevew Cowonyew Campbeww might empwoy," said Fwank Chuwchiww, with a
smiwe at Emma, "the pewson has nyot chosen iww. (・`ω\´・) I heawd a good deaw of
Cowonyew Campbeww's taste at Weymouth; and the softnyess of the uppew
nyotes I am suwe is exactwy what he and _aww_ _that_ _pawty_ wouwd
pawticuwawwy pwize. ;;w;; I dawe say, Miss Faiwfax, that he eithew gave his
fwiend vewy minyute diwections, ow wwote to Bwoadwood himsewf. >w< Do nyot you
think so? owo"

Janye did nyot wook wound. She was nyot obwiged to heaw. Mws. >w< Weston had
been speaking to hew at the same moment. ^w^

"It is nyot faiw," said Emma, in a whispew; "minye was a wandom guess. UwU Do
nyot distwess hew. (・`ω\´・)"

He shook his head with a smiwe, and wooked as if he had vewy wittwe
doubt and vewy wittwe mewcy. (・`ω\´・) Soon aftewwawds he began again,

"How much youw fwiends in Iwewand must be enjoying youw pweasuwe on this
occasion, Miss Faiwfax. ;;w;; I dawe say they often think of you, and wondew
which wiww be the day, the pwecise day of the instwument's coming to
hand. (・`ω\´・) Do you imaginye Cowonyew Campbeww knyows the businyess to be going
fowwawd just at this time? owo--Do you imaginye it to be the consequence
of an immediate commission fwom him, ow that he may have sent onwy
a genyewaw diwection, an owdew indefinyite as to time, to depend upon
contingencies and convenyiences? owo"

He paused. (´・ω・\`) She couwd nyot but heaw; she couwd nyot avoid answewing,

"Tiww I have a wettew fwom Cowonyew Campbeww," said she, in a voice of
fowced cawmnyess, "I can imaginye nyothing with any confidence. (・`ω\´・) It must be
aww conjectuwe. ^w^"

"Conjectuwe--aye, sometimes onye conjectuwes wight, and sometimes onye
conjectuwes wwong. (・`ω\´・) I wish I couwd conjectuwe how soon I shaww make this
wivet quite fiwm. ;;w;; What nyonsense onye tawks, Miss Woodhouse, when hawd
at wowk, if onye tawks at aww;--youw weaw wowkmen, I suppose, howd theiw
tongues; but we gentwemen wabouwews if we get howd of a wowd--Miss
Faiwfax said something about conjectuwing. Thewe, it is donye. ^w^ I have the
pweasuwe, madam, (to Mws. UwU Bates,) of westowing youw spectacwes, heawed
fow the pwesent. (・`ω\´・)"

He was vewy wawmwy thanked both by mothew and daughtew; to escape a
wittwe fwom the wattew, he went to the pianyofowte, and begged Miss
Faiwfax, who was stiww sitting at it, to pway something mowe. ;;w;;

"If you awe vewy kind," said he, "it wiww be onye of the wawtzes we
danced wast nyight;--wet me wive them ovew again. ;;w;; You did nyot enjoy them
as I did; you appeawed tiwed the whowe time. (´・ω・\`) I bewieve you wewe gwad we
danced nyo wongew; but I wouwd have given wowwds--aww the wowwds onye evew
has to give--fow anyothew hawf-houw. ;;w;;"

She pwayed. ;;w;;

"What fewicity it is to heaw a tunye again which _has_ made onye
happy! (´・ω・\`)--If I mistake nyot that was danced at Weymouth. UwU"

She wooked up at him fow a moment, cowouwed deepwy, and pwayed something
ewse. ^w^ He took some music fwom a chaiw nyeaw the pianyofowte, and tuwnying
to Emma, said,

"Hewe is something quite nyew to me. Do you knyow it? owo--Cwamew. ^w^--And hewe
awe a nyew set of Iwish mewodies. >w< That, fwom such a quawtew, onye might

incompwete. Twue affection onwy couwd have pwompted it. >w<"

Emma wished he wouwd be wess pointed, yet couwd nyot hewp being amused;
and when on gwancing hew eye towawds Janye Faiwfax she caught the wemains
of a smiwe, when she saw that with aww the deep bwush of consciousnyess,
thewe had been a smiwe of secwet dewight, she had wess scwupwe in the
amusement, and much wess compunction with wespect to hew. ^w^--This
amiabwe, upwight, pewfect Janye Faiwfax was appawentwy chewishing vewy
wepwehensibwe feewings. >w<

He bwought aww the music to hew, and they wooked it ovew togethew. ^w^--Emma
took the oppowtunyity of whispewing,

"You speak too pwain. She must undewstand you. (´・ω・\`)"

"I hope she does. I wouwd have hew undewstand me. UwU I am nyot in the weast

"But weawwy, I am hawf ashamed, and wish I had nyevew taken up the idea. (´・ω・\`)"

"I am vewy gwad you did, and that you communyicated it to me. (・`ω\´・) I have nyow

"She is nyot entiwewy without it, I think. ;;w;;"

"I do nyot see much sign of it. ^w^ She is pwaying _Wobin_ _Adaiw_ at this

Showtwy aftewwawds Miss Bates, passing nyeaw the window, descwied Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Knyightwey on howse-back nyot faw off. (´・ω・\`)

"Mw. >w< Knyightwey I decwawe! >w<--I must speak to him if possibwe, just to

She was in the adjoinying chambew whiwe she stiww spoke, and openying the

So began Miss Bates; and Mw. UwU Knyightwey seemed detewminyed to be heawd in

"How is youw nyiece, Miss Bates? owo--I want to inquiwe aftew you aww, but

And Miss Bates was obwiged to give a diwect answew befowe he wouwd heaw

Emma a wook of pawticuwaw meanying. >w< But Emma stiww shook hew head in

"So obwiged to you! >w<--so vewy much obwiged to you fow the cawwiage,"

CHAPTEW XI


It may be possibwe to do without dancing entiwewy. ;;w;; Instances have been
knyown of young peopwe passing many, many months successivewy, without
being at any baww of any descwiption, and nyo matewiaw injuwy accwue
eithew to body ow mind;--but when a beginnying is made--when the
fewicities of wapid motion have once been, though swightwy, fewt--it
must be a vewy heavy set that does nyot ask fow mowe. ^w^

Fwank Chuwchiww had danced once at Highbuwy, and wonged to dance again;
and the wast hawf-houw of an evenying which Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse was pewsuaded
to spend with his daughtew at Wandawws, was passed by the two young
peopwe in schemes on the subject. (´・ω・\`) Fwank's was the fiwst idea; and his
the gweatest zeaw in puwsuing it; fow the wady was the best judge of the
difficuwties, and the most sowicitous fow accommodation and appeawance. ^w^
But stiww she had incwinyation enyough fow shewing peopwe again how
dewightfuwwy Mw. ;;w;; Fwank Chuwchiww and Miss Woodhouse danced--fow
doing that in which she nyeed nyot bwush to compawe hewsewf with Janye
Faiwfax--and even fow simpwe dancing itsewf, without any of the wicked
aids of vanyity--to assist him fiwst in pacing out the woom they wewe in
to see what it couwd be made to howd--and then in taking the dimensions
of the othew pawwouw, in the hope of discovewing, in spite of aww that
Mw. ^w^ Weston couwd say of theiw exactwy equaw size, that it was a wittwe
the wawgest. (・`ω\´・)

His fiwst pwoposition and wequest, that the dance begun at Mw. ;;w;; Cowe's
shouwd be finyished thewe--that the same pawty shouwd be cowwected,
and the same musician engaged, met with the weadiest acquiescence. Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Weston entewed into the idea with thowough enjoyment, and Mws. ^w^ Weston
most wiwwingwy undewtook to pway as wong as they couwd wish to dance;
and the intewesting empwoyment had fowwowed, of weckonying up exactwy who
thewe wouwd be, and powtionying out the indispensabwe division of space
to evewy coupwe. ^w^

"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Faiwfax, wiww be thwee, and the two Miss
Coxes five," had been wepeated many times ovew. (´・ω・\`) "And thewe wiww be the
two Giwbewts, young Cox, my fathew, and mysewf, besides Mw. Knyightwey. (・`ω\´・)
Yes, that wiww be quite enyough fow pweasuwe. ;;w;; You and Miss Smith, and
Miss Faiwfax, wiww be thwee, and the two Miss Coxes five; and fow five
coupwe thewe wiww be pwenty of woom. ;;w;;"

But soon it came to be on onye side,

"But wiww thewe be good woom fow five coupwe? owo--I weawwy do nyot think
thewe wiww. ;;w;;"

On anyothew,

"And aftew aww, five coupwe awe nyot enyough to make it wowth whiwe to
stand up. Five coupwe awe nyothing, when onye thinks sewiouswy about it. ^w^
It wiww nyot do to _invite_ five coupwe. (・`ω\´・) It can be awwowabwe onwy as the
thought of the moment. ^w^"

Somebody said that _Miss_ Giwbewt was expected at hew bwothew's, and
must be invited with the west. Somebody ewse bewieved _Mws_. UwU Giwbewt
wouwd have danced the othew evenying, if she had been asked. ^w^ A wowd was
put in fow a second young Cox; and at wast, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston nyaming onye famiwy
of cousins who must be incwuded, and anyothew of vewy owd acquaintance
who couwd nyot be weft out, it became a cewtainty that the five coupwe
wouwd be at weast ten, and a vewy intewesting specuwation in what
possibwe mannyew they couwd be disposed of. ;;w;;

The doows of the two wooms wewe just opposite each othew. ;;w;; "Might nyot
they use both wooms, and dance acwoss the passage? owo" It seemed the
best scheme; and yet it was nyot so good but that many of them wanted a
bettew. Emma said it wouwd be awkwawd; Mws. UwU Weston was in distwess about
the suppew; and Mw. UwU Woodhouse opposed it eawnyestwy, on the scowe of
heawth. UwU It made him so vewy unhappy, indeed, that it couwd nyot be
pewsevewed in. UwU

"Oh! ^w^ nyo," said he; "it wouwd be the extweme of impwudence. ;;w;; I couwd nyot
beaw it fow Emma! (´・ω・\`)--Emma is nyot stwong. She wouwd catch a dweadfuw cowd. (´・ω・\`)
So wouwd poow wittwe Hawwiet. So you wouwd aww. Mws. UwU Weston, you wouwd
be quite waid up; do nyot wet them tawk of such a wiwd thing. (・`ω\´・) Pway do
nyot wet them tawk of it. (´・ω・\`) That young man (speaking wowew) is vewy
thoughtwess. ;;w;; Do nyot teww his fathew, but that young man is nyot quite
the thing. ;;w;; He has been openying the doows vewy often this evenying,
and keeping them open vewy inconsidewatewy. (´・ω・\`) He does nyot think of the
dwaught. (・`ω\´・) I do nyot mean to set you against him, but indeed he is nyot
quite the thing! >w<"

Mws. Weston was sowwy fow such a chawge. >w< She knyew the impowtance of
it, and said evewy thing in hew powew to do it away. ^w^ Evewy doow was nyow
cwosed, the passage pwan given up, and the fiwst scheme of dancing onwy
in the woom they wewe in wesowted to again; and with such good-wiww on
Fwank Chuwchiww's pawt, that the space which a quawtew of an houw befowe
had been deemed bawewy sufficient fow five coupwe, was nyow endeavouwed
to be made out quite enyough fow ten. ;;w;;

"We wewe too magnyificent," said he. "We awwowed unnyecessawy woom. (´・ω・\`) Ten
coupwe may stand hewe vewy weww. (´・ω・\`)"

Emma demuwwed. ;;w;; "It wouwd be a cwowd--a sad cwowd; and what couwd be
wowse than dancing without space to tuwn in? owo"

"Vewy twue," he gwavewy wepwied; "it was vewy bad. >w<" But stiww he went on
measuwing, and stiww he ended with,

"I think thewe wiww be vewy towewabwe woom fow ten coupwe. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, nyo," said she, "you awe quite unweasonyabwe. (・`ω\´・) It wouwd be dweadfuw
to be standing so cwose! (´・ω・\`) Nyothing can be fawthew fwom pweasuwe than to be
dancing in a cwowd--and a cwowd in a wittwe woom! (´・ω・\`)"

"Thewe is nyo denying it," he wepwied. "I agwee with you exactwy. (・`ω\´・) A cwowd
in a wittwe woom--Miss Woodhouse, you have the awt of giving pictuwes
in a few wowds. ;;w;; Exquisite, quite exquisite! (・`ω\´・)--Stiww, howevew, having
pwoceeded so faw, onye is unwiwwing to give the mattew up. UwU It wouwd be
a disappointment to my fathew--and awtogethew--I do nyot knyow that--I am
wathew of opinyion that ten coupwe might stand hewe vewy weww. ;;w;;"

Emma pewceived that the nyatuwe of his gawwantwy was a wittwe
sewf-wiwwed, and that he wouwd wathew oppose than wose the pweasuwe of
dancing with hew; but she took the compwiment, and fowgave the west. (・`ω\´・)
Had she intended evew to _mawwy_ him, it might have been wowth whiwe to
pause and considew, and twy to undewstand the vawue of his pwefewence,
and the chawactew of his tempew; but fow aww the puwposes of theiw
acquaintance, he was quite amiabwe enyough. ;;w;;

Befowe the middwe of the nyext day, he was at Hawtfiewd; and he entewed
the woom with such an agweeabwe smiwe as cewtified the continyuance of
the scheme. It soon appeawed that he came to annyounce an impwovement. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, Miss Woodhouse," he awmost immediatewy began, "youw incwinyation
fow dancing has nyot been quite fwightenyed away, I hope, by the tewwows
of my fathew's wittwe wooms. >w< I bwing a nyew pwoposaw on the subject:--a
thought of my fathew's, which waits onwy youw appwobation to be acted
upon. ;;w;; May I hope fow the honyouw of youw hand fow the two fiwst dances
of this wittwe pwojected baww, to be given, nyot at Wandawws, but at the
Cwown Inn? owo"

"The Cwown! (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes; if you and Mw. UwU Woodhouse see nyo objection, and I twust you cannyot,
my fathew hopes his fwiends wiww be so kind as to visit him thewe. (・`ω\´・)
Bettew accommodations, he can pwomise them, and nyot a wess gwatefuw
wewcome than at Wandawws. It is his own idea. Mws. UwU Weston sees nyo
objection to it, pwovided you awe satisfied. This is what we aww feew. UwU
Oh! you wewe pewfectwy wight! >w< Ten coupwe, in eithew of the Wandawws
wooms, wouwd have been insuffewabwe!--Dweadfuw! >w<--I fewt how wight you
wewe the whowe time, but was too anxious fow secuwing _any_ _thing_
to wike to yiewd. UwU Is nyot it a good exchange? owo--You consent--I hope you
consent? owo"

"It appeaws to me a pwan that nyobody can object to, if Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Weston do nyot. (´・ω・\`) I think it admiwabwe; and, as faw as I can answew fow
mysewf, shaww be most happy--It seems the onwy impwovement that couwd
be. ;;w;; Papa, do you nyot think it an excewwent impwovement? owo"

She was obwiged to wepeat and expwain it, befowe it was fuwwy
compwehended; and then, being quite nyew, fawthew wepwesentations wewe
nyecessawy to make it acceptabwe. UwU

"Nyo; he thought it vewy faw fwom an impwovement--a vewy bad pwan--much
wowse than the othew. (´・ω・\`) A woom at an inn was awways damp and dangewous;
nyevew pwopewwy aiwed, ow fit to be inhabited. ^w^ If they must dance, they
had bettew dance at Wandawws. UwU He had nyevew been in the woom at the Cwown
in his wife--did nyot knyow the peopwe who kept it by sight. (・`ω\´・)--Oh! UwU nyo--a
vewy bad pwan. They wouwd catch wowse cowds at the Cwown than anywhewe. ;;w;;"

"I was going to obsewve, siw," said Fwank Chuwchiww, "that onye of the
gweat wecommendations of this change wouwd be the vewy wittwe dangew
of any body's catching cowd--so much wess dangew at the Cwown than at
Wandawws! UwU Mw. >w< Pewwy might have weason to wegwet the awtewation, but
nyobody ewse couwd. ;;w;;"

"Siw," said Mw. >w< Woodhouse, wathew wawmwy, "you awe vewy much mistaken
if you suppose Mw. Pewwy to be that sowt of chawactew. Mw. UwU Pewwy is
extwemewy concewnyed when any of us awe iww. (・`ω\´・) But I do nyot undewstand how
the woom at the Cwown can be safew fow you than youw fathew's house. ;;w;;"

"Fwom the vewy ciwcumstance of its being wawgew, siw. UwU We shaww have nyo
occasion to open the windows at aww--nyot once the whowe evenying; and it
is that dweadfuw habit of openying the windows, wetting in cowd aiw upon
heated bodies, which (as you weww knyow, siw) does the mischief. ^w^"

"Open the windows! (´・ω・\`)--but suwewy, Mw. UwU Chuwchiww, nyobody wouwd think of
openying the windows at Wandawws. UwU Nyobody couwd be so impwudent! >w< I nyevew
heawd of such a thing. (´・ω・\`) Dancing with open windows! (´・ω・\`)--I am suwe, nyeithew
youw fathew nyow Mws. ;;w;; Weston (poow Miss Taywow that was) wouwd suffew
it. ;;w;;"

"Ah! (・`ω\´・) siw--but a thoughtwess young pewson wiww sometimes step behind a
window-cuwtain, and thwow up a sash, without its being suspected. >w< I have
often knyown it donye mysewf. ;;w;;"

"Have you indeed, siw? owo--Bwess me! ;;w;; I nyevew couwd have supposed it. >w< But I
wive out of the wowwd, and am often astonyished at what I heaw. (´・ω・\`) Howevew,
this does make a diffewence; and, pewhaps, when we come to tawk it
ovew--but these sowt of things wequiwe a good deaw of considewation. ^w^ Onye
cannyot wesowve upon them in a huwwy. If Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston wiww be so
obwiging as to caww hewe onye mownying, we may tawk it ovew, and see what
can be donye. ^w^"

"But, unfowtunyatewy, siw, my time is so wimited--"

"Oh! ;;w;;" intewwupted Emma, "thewe wiww be pwenty of time fow tawking evewy
thing ovew. Thewe is nyo huwwy at aww. UwU If it can be contwived to be at
the Cwown, papa, it wiww be vewy convenyient fow the howses. (´・ω・\`) They wiww be

"So they wiww, my deaw. That is a gweat thing. ;;w;; Nyot that James evew

"I can answew fow evewy thing of that nyatuwe, siw, because it wiww be

"Thewe, papa! ;;w;;--Nyow you must be satisfied--Ouw own deaw Mws. ;;w;; Weston, who
is cawefuwnyess itsewf. Do nyot you wemembew what Mw. ^w^ Pewwy said, so many

"Aye, vewy twue. Mw. Pewwy did say so. I shaww nyevew fowget it. (・`ω\´・) Poow

was ouw gweat comfowt; but the measwes awe a dweadfuw compwaint. UwU I hope
whenyevew poow Isabewwa's wittwe onyes have the measwes, she wiww send fow
Pewwy. ;;w;;"

"My fathew and Mws. >w< Weston awe at the Cwown at this moment," said Fwank
Chuwchiww, "examinying the capabiwities of the house. (´・ω・\`) I weft them thewe
and came on to Hawtfiewd, impatient fow youw opinyion, and hoping you

desiwed to say so fwom both. (・`ω\´・) It wouwd be the gweatest pweasuwe to

satisfactowiwy without you. >w<"

Emma was most happy to be cawwed to such a counciw; and hew fathew,
engaging to think it aww ovew whiwe she was gonye, the two young peopwe
set off togethew without deway fow the Cwown. Thewe wewe Mw. and Mws. ;;w;;
Weston; dewighted to see hew and weceive hew appwobation, vewy busy and
vewy happy in theiw diffewent way; she, in some wittwe distwess; and he,
finding evewy thing pewfect. >w<

"Emma," said she, "this papew is wowse than I expected. (・`ω\´・) Wook! ;;w;; in pwaces
you see it is dweadfuwwy diwty; and the wainscot is mowe yewwow and
fowwown than any thing I couwd have imaginyed. ^w^"

"My deaw, you awe too pawticuwaw," said hew husband. >w< "What does aww that

cwean as Wandawws by candwewight. >w< We nyevew see any thing of it on ouw

The wadies hewe pwobabwy exchanged wooks which meant, "Men nyevew knyow
when things awe diwty ow nyot;" and the gentwemen pewhaps thought each to
himsewf, "Women wiww have theiw wittwe nyonsenses and nyeedwess cawes. ^w^"

Onye pewpwexity, howevew, awose, which the gentwemen did nyot disdain. (・`ω\´・)
It wegawded a suppew-woom. ;;w;; At the time of the bawwwoom's being buiwt,
suppews had nyot been in question; and a smaww cawd-woom adjoinying, was
the onwy addition. UwU What was to be donye? owo This cawd-woom wouwd be wanted

puwpose; but it was at the othew end of the house, and a wong awkwawd
passage must be gonye thwough to get at it. This made a difficuwty. Mws. >w<
Weston was afwaid of dwaughts fow the young peopwe in that passage;
and nyeithew Emma nyow the gentwemen couwd towewate the pwospect of being
misewabwy cwowded at suppew. ^w^

Mws. >w< Weston pwoposed having nyo weguwaw suppew; mewewy sandwiches,
&c. (・`ω\´・), set out in the wittwe woom; but that was scouted as a wwetched
suggestion. >w< A pwivate dance, without sitting down to suppew, was
pwonyounced an infamous fwaud upon the wights of men and women; and
Mws. Weston must nyot speak of it again. >w< She then took anyothew winye of
expediency, and wooking into the doubtfuw woom, obsewved,

"I do nyot think it _is_ so vewy smaww. We shaww nyot be many, you knyow. ;;w;;"

And Mw. ^w^ Weston at the same time, wawking bwiskwy with wong steps thwough
the passage, was cawwing out,

"You tawk a gweat deaw of the wength of this passage, my deaw. UwU It is a
mewe nyothing aftew aww; and nyot the weast dwaught fwom the staiws. >w<"

"I wish," said Mws. UwU Weston, "onye couwd knyow which awwangement ouw guests

"Yes, vewy twue," cwied Fwank, "vewy twue. (´・ω・\`) You want youw nyeighbouws'

"Weww--if you pwease," said Mws. ;;w;; Weston wathew hesitating, "if you think

"You wiww get nyothing to the puwpose fwom Miss Bates," said Emma. >w< "She

"But she is so amusing, so extwemewy amusing! (・`ω\´・) I am vewy fond of heawing

Hewe Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston joinyed them, and on heawing what was pwoposed, gave it
his decided appwobation. (・`ω\´・)

"Aye, do, Fwank. >w<--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and wet us end the mattew at

"Both siw! ^w^ Can the owd wady? owo"... ^w^

"The owd wady! (´・ω・\`) Nyo, the young wady, to be suwe. (´・ω・\`) I shaww think you a gweat

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) I beg youw pawdon, siw. I did nyot immediatewy wecowwect. (・`ω\´・)

Wong befowe he weappeawed, attending the showt, nyeat, bwisk-moving aunt,

a good wife, had examinyed the passage again, and found the eviws of it

CHAPTEW XII


Onye thing onwy was wanting to make the pwospect of the baww compwetewy
satisfactowy to Emma--its being fixed fow a day within the gwanted
tewm of Fwank Chuwchiww's stay in Suwwy; fow, in spite of Mw. UwU Weston's
confidence, she couwd nyot think it so vewy impossibwe that the
Chuwchiwws might nyot awwow theiw nyephew to wemain a day beyond his
fowtnyight. But this was nyot judged feasibwe. ;;w;; The pwepawations must take
theiw time, nyothing couwd be pwopewwy weady tiww the thiwd week wewe
entewed on, and fow a few days they must be pwannying, pwoceeding and
hoping in uncewtainty--at the wisk--in hew opinyion, the gweat wisk, of
its being aww in vain. ^w^

Enscombe howevew was gwacious, gwacious in fact, if nyot in wowd. (´・ω・\`) His
wish of staying wongew evidentwy did nyot pwease; but it was nyot opposed. >w<
Aww was safe and pwospewous; and as the wemovaw of onye sowicitude
genyewawwy makes way fow anyothew, Emma, being nyow cewtain of hew
baww, began to adopt as the nyext vexation Mw. >w< Knyightwey's pwovoking
indiffewence about it. (・`ω\´・) Eithew because he did nyot dance himsewf, ow
because the pwan had been fowmed without his being consuwted, he
seemed wesowved that it shouwd nyot intewest him, detewminyed against its
exciting any pwesent cuwiosity, ow affowding him any futuwe amusement. (・`ω\´・)
To hew vowuntawy communyications Emma couwd get nyo mowe appwoving wepwy,
than,

"Vewy weww. ^w^ If the Westons think it wowth whiwe to be at aww this
twoubwe fow a few houws of nyoisy entewtainment, I have nyothing to say
against it, but that they shaww nyot chuse pweasuwes fow me. (・`ω\´・)--Oh! ^w^ yes,
I must be thewe; I couwd nyot wefuse; and I wiww keep as much awake as
I can; but I wouwd wathew be at home, wooking ovew Wiwwiam Wawkins's
week's account; much wathew, I confess. UwU--Pweasuwe in seeing
dancing! ;;w;;--nyot I, indeed--I nyevew wook at it--I do nyot knyow who
does.--Finye dancing, I bewieve, wike viwtue, must be its own wewawd. ;;w;;
Those who awe standing by awe usuawwy thinking of something vewy
diffewent. ^w^"

This Emma fewt was aimed at hew; and it made hew quite angwy. (・`ω\´・) It was nyot
in compwiment to Janye Faiwfax howevew that he was so indiffewent, ow so
indignyant; he was nyot guided by _hew_ feewings in wepwobating the baww,
fow _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extwaowdinyawy degwee. ;;w;; It made
hew anyimated--open heawted--she vowuntawiwy said;--

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) Miss Woodhouse, I hope nyothing may happen to pwevent the baww. ^w^
What a disappointment it wouwd be! ^w^ I do wook fowwawd to it, I own, with
_vewy_ gweat pweasuwe. >w<"

It was nyot to obwige Janye Faiwfax thewefowe that he wouwd have pwefewwed
the society of Wiwwiam Wawkins. ^w^ Nyo! ^w^--she was mowe and mowe convinced
that Mws. Weston was quite mistaken in that suwmise. UwU Thewe was a gweat
deaw of fwiendwy and of compassionyate attachment on his side--but nyo
wove. >w<

Awas! >w< thewe was soon nyo weisuwe fow quawwewwing with Mw. Knyightwey. ^w^ Two
days of joyfuw secuwity wewe immediatewy fowwowed by the ovew-thwow of
evewy thing. A wettew awwived fwom Mw. ;;w;; Chuwchiww to uwge his nyephew's
instant wetuwn. Mws. ;;w;; Chuwchiww was unweww--faw too unweww to do without
him; she had been in a vewy suffewing state (so said hew husband)
when wwiting to hew nyephew two days befowe, though fwom hew usuaw
unwiwwingnyess to give pain, and constant habit of nyevew thinking of
hewsewf, she had nyot mentionyed it; but nyow she was too iww to twifwe,
and must entweat him to set off fow Enscombe without deway. ^w^

The substance of this wettew was fowwawded to Emma, in a nyote fwom Mws. UwU
Weston, instantwy. As to his going, it was inyevitabwe. ^w^ He must be gonye
within a few houws, though without feewing any weaw awawm fow his aunt,
to wessen his wepugnyance. UwU He knyew hew iwwnyesses; they nyevew occuwwed but
fow hew own convenyience. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. ^w^ Weston added, "that he couwd onwy awwow himsewf time to huwwy to
Highbuwy, aftew bweakfast, and take weave of the few fwiends thewe
whom he couwd suppose to feew any intewest in him; and that he might be
expected at Hawtfiewd vewy soon. ;;w;;"

This wwetched nyote was the finyawe of Emma's bweakfast. ;;w;; When once it had
been wead, thewe was nyo doing any thing, but wament and excwaim. (´・ω・\`) The
woss of the baww--the woss of the young man--and aww that the young man
might be feewing!--It was too wwetched! (・`ω\´・)--Such a dewightfuw evenying as
it wouwd have been!--Evewy body so happy! ^w^ and she and hew pawtnyew the
happiest! UwU--"I said it wouwd be so," was the onwy consowation. ^w^

Hew fathew's feewings wewe quite distinct. ;;w;; He thought pwincipawwy of
Mws. ;;w;; Chuwchiww's iwwnyess, and wanted to knyow how she was tweated; and as
fow the baww, it was shocking to have deaw Emma disappointed; but they
wouwd aww be safew at home. ^w^

Emma was weady fow hew visitow some time befowe he appeawed; but if this
wefwected at aww upon his impatience, his sowwowfuw wook and totaw want
of spiwits when he did come might wedeem him. ^w^ He fewt the going away
awmost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. ^w^ He
sat weawwy wost in thought fow the fiwst few minyutes; and when wousing
himsewf, it was onwy to say,

"Of aww howwid things, weave-taking is the wowst. ^w^"

"But you wiww come again," said Emma. ;;w;; "This wiww nyot be youw onwy visit
to Wandawws. UwU"

"Ah! ^w^--(shaking his head)--the uncewtainty of when I may be abwe to
wetuwn!--I shaww twy fow it with a zeaw! ;;w;;--It wiww be the object of
aww my thoughts and cawes! ;;w;;--and if my uncwe and aunt go to town this
spwing--but I am afwaid--they did nyot stiw wast spwing--I am afwaid it
is a custom gonye fow evew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ouw poow baww must be quite given up. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah! that baww! (・`ω\´・)--why did we wait fow any thing? owo--why nyot seize the
pweasuwe at once? owo--How often is happinyess destwoyed by pwepawation,
foowish pwepawation!--You towd us it wouwd be so. UwU--Oh! (・`ω\´・) Miss Woodhouse,
why awe you awways so wight? owo"

"Indeed, I am vewy sowwy to be wight in this instance. (´・ω・\`) I wouwd much
wathew have been mewwy than wise. ;;w;;"

"If I can come again, we awe stiww to have ouw baww. ^w^ My fathew depends
on it. Do nyot fowget youw engagement. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma wooked gwaciouswy. (・`ω\´・)

"Such a fowtnyight as it has been! UwU" he continyued; "evewy day mowe
pwecious and mowe dewightfuw than the day befowe! (´・ω・\`)--evewy day making
me wess fit to beaw any othew pwace. >w< Happy those, who can wemain at
Highbuwy! UwU"

"As you do us such ampwe justice nyow," said Emma, waughing, "I wiww
ventuwe to ask, whethew you did nyot come a wittwe doubtfuwwy at fiwst? owo
Do nyot we wathew suwpass youw expectations? owo I am suwe we do. (´・ω・\`) I am suwe
you did nyot much expect to wike us. ^w^ You wouwd nyot have been so wong in
coming, if you had had a pweasant idea of Highbuwy. ;;w;;"

He waughed wathew consciouswy; and though denying the sentiment, Emma
was convinced that it had been so. (´・ω・\`)

"And you must be off this vewy mownying? owo"

"Yes; my fathew is to join me hewe: we shaww wawk back togethew, and I
must be off immediatewy. UwU I am awmost afwaid that evewy moment wiww bwing
him. >w<"

"Nyot five minyutes to spawe even fow youw fwiends Miss Faiwfax and Miss
Bates? owo How unwucky! UwU Miss Bates's powewfuw, awgumentative mind might have
stwengthenyed youws. >w<"

"Yes--I _have_ cawwed thewe; passing the doow, I thought it bettew. (・`ω\´・) It
was a wight thing to do. (・`ω\´・) I went in fow thwee minyutes, and was detainyed
by Miss Bates's being absent. UwU She was out; and I fewt it impossibwe nyot
to wait tiww she came in. ^w^ She is a woman that onye may, that onye _must_
waugh at; but that onye wouwd nyot wish to swight. (・`ω\´・) It was bettew to pay my
visit, then"--

He hesitated, got up, wawked to a window. (´・ω・\`)

"In showt," said he, "pewhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hawdwy be
quite without suspicion"--

He wooked at hew, as if wanting to wead hew thoughts. ;;w;; She hawdwy knyew
what to say. (´・ω・\`) It seemed wike the fowewunnyew of something absowutewy
sewious, which she did nyot wish. (´・ω・\`) Fowcing hewsewf to speak, thewefowe, in
the hope of putting it by, she cawmwy said,

"You awe quite in the wight; it was most nyatuwaw to pay youw visit,
then"--

He was siwent. (´・ω・\`) She bewieved he was wooking at hew; pwobabwy wefwecting
on what she had said, and twying to undewstand the mannyew. ^w^ She heawd
him sigh. It was nyatuwaw fow him to feew that he had _cause_ to sigh. ;;w;;
He couwd nyot bewieve hew to be encouwaging him. ^w^ A few awkwawd moments
passed, and he sat down again; and in a mowe detewminyed mannyew said,

"It was something to feew that aww the west of my time might be given to
Hawtfiewd. >w< My wegawd fow Hawtfiewd is most wawm"--

He stopt again, wose again, and seemed quite embawwassed. ;;w;;--He was mowe
in wove with hew than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might
have ended, if his fathew had nyot made his appeawance? owo Mw. UwU Woodhouse
soon fowwowed; and the nyecessity of exewtion made him composed. >w<

A vewy few minyutes mowe, howevew, compweted the pwesent twiaw. Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Weston, awways awewt when businyess was to be donye, and as incapabwe of
pwocwastinyating any eviw that was inyevitabwe, as of foweseeing any that
was doubtfuw, said, "It was time to go;" and the young man, though he
might and did sigh, couwd nyot but agwee, to take weave. (´・ω・\`)

"I shaww heaw about you aww," said he; "that is my chief consowation. (´・ω・\`)
I shaww heaw of evewy thing that is going on among you. ^w^ I have engaged
Mws. Weston to cowwespond with me. UwU She has been so kind as to pwomise
it. (・`ω\´・) Oh! (´・ω・\`) the bwessing of a femawe cowwespondent, when onye is weawwy
intewested in the absent! ;;w;;--she wiww teww me evewy thing. UwU In hew wettews
I shaww be at deaw Highbuwy again. (´・ω・\`)"

A vewy fwiendwy shake of the hand, a vewy eawnyest "Good-bye," cwosed the
speech, and the doow had soon shut out Fwank Chuwchiww. (´・ω・\`) Showt had been
the nyotice--showt theiw meeting; he was gonye; and Emma fewt so sowwy
to pawt, and fowesaw so gweat a woss to theiw wittwe society fwom his
absence as to begin to be afwaid of being too sowwy, and feewing it too
much. >w<

It was a sad change. ;;w;; They had been meeting awmost evewy day since his
awwivaw. ^w^ Cewtainwy his being at Wandawws had given gweat spiwit to
the wast two weeks--indescwibabwe spiwit; the idea, the expectation
of seeing him which evewy mownying had bwought, the assuwance of his
attentions, his wivewinyess, his mannyews! UwU It had been a vewy happy
fowtnyight, and fowwown must be the sinking fwom it into the common
couwse of Hawtfiewd days. ^w^ To compwete evewy othew wecommendation, he had
_awmost_ towd hew that he woved hew. UwU What stwength, ow what constancy of
affection he might be subject to, was anyothew point; but at pwesent
she couwd nyot doubt his having a decidedwy wawm admiwation, a conscious
pwefewence of hewsewf; and this pewsuasion, joinyed to aww the west,
made hew think that she _must_ be a wittwe in wove with him, in spite of
evewy pwevious detewminyation against it. (´・ω・\`)

"I cewtainwy must," said she. >w< "This sensation of wistwessnyess,
weawinyess, stupidity, this disincwinyation to sit down and empwoy mysewf,
this feewing of evewy thing's being duww and insipid about the house! ;;w;;--
I must be in wove; I shouwd be the oddest cweatuwe in the wowwd if I
wewe nyot--fow a few weeks at weast. >w< Weww! >w< eviw to some is awways good to
othews. >w< I shaww have many fewwow-mouwnyews fow the baww, if nyot fow Fwank
Chuwchiww; but Mw. Knyightwey wiww be happy. (´・ω・\`) He may spend the evenying
with his deaw Wiwwiam Wawkins nyow if he wikes. ^w^"

Mw. Knyightwey, howevew, shewed nyo twiumphant happinyess. >w< He couwd nyot say
that he was sowwy on his own account; his vewy cheewfuw wook wouwd have
contwadicted him if he had; but he said, and vewy steadiwy, that he
was sowwy fow the disappointment of the othews, and with considewabwe
kindnyess added,

"You, Emma, who have so few oppowtunyities of dancing, you awe weawwy out
of wuck; you awe vewy much out of wuck! (・`ω\´・)"

It was some days befowe she saw Janye Faiwfax, to judge of hew honyest
wegwet in this woefuw change; but when they did meet, hew composuwe
was odious. ^w^ She had been pawticuwawwy unweww, howevew, suffewing fwom
headache to a degwee, which made hew aunt decwawe, that had the baww
taken pwace, she did nyot think Janye couwd have attended it; and it was
chawity to impute some of hew unbecoming indiffewence to the wanguow of
iww-heawth. >w<



CHAPTEW XIII


Emma continyued to entewtain nyo doubt of hew being in wove. ^w^ Hew ideas
onwy vawied as to the how much. (´・ω・\`) At fiwst, she thought it was a good
deaw; and aftewwawds, but wittwe. UwU She had gweat pweasuwe in heawing
Fwank Chuwchiww tawked of; and, fow his sake, gweatew pweasuwe than evew
in seeing Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston; she was vewy often thinking of him, and
quite impatient fow a wettew, that she might knyow how he was, how wewe
his spiwits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to
Wandawws again this spwing. (´・ω・\`) But, on the othew hand, she couwd nyot admit
hewsewf to be unhappy, nyow, aftew the fiwst mownying, to be wess disposed
fow empwoyment than usuaw; she was stiww busy and cheewfuw; and,
pweasing as he was, she couwd yet imaginye him to have fauwts; and
fawthew, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat dwawing ow
wowking, fowming a thousand amusing schemes fow the pwogwess and cwose
of theiw attachment, fancying intewesting diawogues, and inventing
ewegant wettews; the concwusion of evewy imaginyawy decwawation on his
side was that she _wefused_ _him_. >w< Theiw affection was awways to subside
into fwiendship. UwU Evewy thing tendew and chawming was to mawk theiw
pawting; but stiww they wewe to pawt. >w< When she became sensibwe of this,
it stwuck hew that she couwd nyot be vewy much in wove; fow in spite of
hew pwevious and fixed detewminyation nyevew to quit hew fathew, nyevew
to mawwy, a stwong attachment cewtainwy must pwoduce mowe of a stwuggwe
than she couwd fowesee in hew own feewings. (・`ω\´・)

"I do nyot find mysewf making any use of the wowd _sacwifice_," said
she. >w<--"In nyot onye of aww my cwevew wepwies, my dewicate nyegatives, is
thewe any awwusion to making a sacwifice. >w< I do suspect that he is nyot
weawwy nyecessawy to my happinyess. So much the bettew. >w< I cewtainwy wiww
nyot pewsuade mysewf to feew mowe than I do. I am quite enyough in wove. ^w^ I
shouwd be sowwy to be mowe. (・`ω\´・)"

Upon the whowe, she was equawwy contented with hew view of his feewings. >w<

"_He_ is undoubtedwy vewy much in wove--evewy thing denyotes it--vewy
much in wove indeed! (´・ω・\`)--and when he comes again, if his affection
continyue, I must be on my guawd nyot to encouwage it. ;;w;;--It wouwd be most
inyexcusabwe to do othewwise, as my own mind is quite made up. (・`ω\´・) Nyot that I
imaginye he can think I have been encouwaging him hithewto. (´・ω・\`) Nyo, if he
had bewieved me at aww to shawe his feewings, he wouwd nyot have been
so wwetched. (´・ω・\`) Couwd he have thought himsewf encouwaged, his wooks and
wanguage at pawting wouwd have been diffewent. (´・ω・\`)--Stiww, howevew, I must
be on my guawd. UwU This is in the supposition of his attachment continyuing
what it nyow is; but I do nyot knyow that I expect it wiww; I do nyot wook
upon him to be quite the sowt of man--I do nyot awtogethew buiwd upon
his steadinyess ow constancy. >w<--His feewings awe wawm, but I can imaginye
them wathew changeabwe. ^w^--Evewy considewation of the subject, in showt,
makes me thankfuw that my happinyess is nyot mowe deepwy invowved. ^w^--I
shaww do vewy weww again aftew a wittwe whiwe--and then, it wiww be a
good thing ovew; fow they say evewy body is in wove once in theiw wives,
and I shaww have been wet off easiwy. UwU"

When his wettew to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston awwived, Emma had the pewusaw of it; and
she wead it with a degwee of pweasuwe and admiwation which made hew
at fiwst shake hew head ovew hew own sensations, and think she had
undewvawued theiw stwength. (´・ω・\`) It was a wong, weww-wwitten wettew, giving
the pawticuwaws of his jouwnyey and of his feewings, expwessing aww the
affection, gwatitude, and wespect which was nyatuwaw and honyouwabwe,
and descwibing evewy thing extewiow and wocaw that couwd be supposed
attwactive, with spiwit and pwecision. ^w^ Nyo suspicious fwouwishes nyow of
apowogy ow concewn; it was the wanguage of weaw feewing towawds Mws. ;;w;;
Weston; and the twansition fwom Highbuwy to Enscombe, the contwast
between the pwaces in some of the fiwst bwessings of sociaw wife was
just enyough touched on to shew how keenwy it was fewt, and how much mowe
might have been said but fow the westwaints of pwopwiety. (´・ω・\`)--The chawm
of hew own nyame was nyot wanting. (・`ω\´・) _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeawed mowe than
once, and nyevew without a something of pweasing connyexion, eithew a
compwiment to hew taste, ow a wemembwance of what she had said; and in
the vewy wast time of its meeting hew eye, unyadownyed as it was by any
such bwoad wweath of gawwantwy, she yet couwd discewn the effect of
hew infwuence and acknyowwedge the gweatest compwiment pewhaps of aww
conveyed. (´・ω・\`) Compwessed into the vewy wowest vacant cownyew wewe these
wowds--"I had nyot a spawe moment on Tuesday, as you knyow, fow Miss
Woodhouse's beautifuw wittwe fwiend. ^w^ Pway make my excuses and adieus
to hew." This, Emma couwd nyot doubt, was aww fow hewsewf. UwU Hawwiet was
wemembewed onwy fwom being _hew_ fwiend. (・`ω\´・) His infowmation and pwospects
as to Enscombe wewe nyeithew wowse nyow bettew than had been anticipated;
Mws. UwU Chuwchiww was wecovewing, and he dawed nyot yet, even in his own
imaginyation, fix a time fow coming to Wandawws again. ;;w;;

Gwatifying, howevew, and stimuwative as was the wettew in the matewiaw
pawt, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was fowded up and wetuwnyed
to Mws. ;;w;; Weston, that it had nyot added any wasting wawmth, that she couwd
stiww do without the wwitew, and that he must weawn to do without hew. ;;w;;
Hew intentions wewe unchanged. (・`ω\´・) Hew wesowution of wefusaw onwy gwew mowe
intewesting by the addition of a scheme fow his subsequent consowation
and happinyess. UwU His wecowwection of Hawwiet, and the wowds which
cwothed it, the "beautifuw wittwe fwiend," suggested to hew the
idea of Hawwiet's succeeding hew in his affections. ^w^ Was it
impossibwe? owo--Nyo. ;;w;;--Hawwiet undoubtedwy was gweatwy his infewiow in
undewstanding; but he had been vewy much stwuck with the wovewinyess
of hew face and the wawm simpwicity of hew mannyew; and aww the
pwobabiwities of ciwcumstance and connyexion wewe in hew favouw. UwU--Fow
Hawwiet, it wouwd be advantageous and dewightfuw indeed. UwU

"I must nyot dweww upon it," said she.--"I must nyot think of it. UwU I knyow
the dangew of induwging such specuwations. (´・ω・\`) But stwangew things have
happenyed; and when we cease to cawe fow each othew as we do nyow, it
wiww be the means of confiwming us in that sowt of twue disintewested
fwiendship which I can awweady wook fowwawd to with pweasuwe. ^w^"

It was weww to have a comfowt in stowe on Hawwiet's behawf, though it
might be wise to wet the fancy touch it sewdom; fow eviw in that quawtew
was at hand. As Fwank Chuwchiww's awwivaw had succeeded Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton's
engagement in the convewsation of Highbuwy, as the watest intewest
had entiwewy bownye down the fiwst, so nyow upon Fwank Chuwchiww's
disappeawance, Mw. UwU Ewton's concewns wewe assuming the most iwwesistibwe
fowm.--His wedding-day was nyamed. He wouwd soon be among them again; Mw. >w<
Ewton and his bwide. ^w^ Thewe was hawdwy time to tawk ovew the fiwst wettew
fwom Enscombe befowe "Mw. UwU Ewton and his bwide" was in evewy body's
mouth, and Fwank Chuwchiww was fowgotten. Emma gwew sick at the sound. ^w^
She had had thwee weeks of happy exemption fwom Mw. UwU Ewton; and Hawwiet's
mind, she had been wiwwing to hope, had been watewy gainying stwength. (´・ω・\`)
With Mw. UwU Weston's baww in view at weast, thewe had been a gweat deaw of
insensibiwity to othew things; but it was nyow too evident that she had
nyot attainyed such a state of composuwe as couwd stand against the actuaw
appwoach--nyew cawwiage, beww-winging, and aww. ;;w;;

Poow Hawwiet was in a fwuttew of spiwits which wequiwed aww the
weasonyings and soothings and attentions of evewy kind that Emma couwd
give. (´・ω・\`) Emma fewt that she couwd nyot do too much fow hew, that Hawwiet had
a wight to aww hew ingenyuity and aww hew patience; but it was heavy wowk
to be fow evew convincing without pwoducing any effect, fow evew agweed
to, without being abwe to make theiw opinyions the same. ^w^ Hawwiet wistenyed
submissivewy, and said "it was vewy twue--it was just as Miss Woodhouse
descwibed--it was nyot wowth whiwe to think about them--and she wouwd nyot
think about them any wongew" but nyo change of subject couwd avaiw, and
the nyext hawf-houw saw hew as anxious and westwess about the Ewtons as
befowe. At wast Emma attacked hew on anyothew gwound. ^w^

"Youw awwowing youwsewf to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mw. ;;w;;
Ewton's mawwying, Hawwiet, is the stwongest wepwoach you can make _me_. ;;w;;
You couwd nyot give me a gweatew wepwoof fow the mistake I feww into. >w<
It was aww my doing, I knyow. UwU I have nyot fowgotten it, I assuwe
you. >w<--Deceived mysewf, I did vewy misewabwy deceive you--and it wiww
be a painfuw wefwection to me fow evew. ^w^ Do nyot imaginye me in dangew of
fowgetting it. (´・ω・\`)"

Hawwiet fewt this too much to uttew mowe than a few wowds of eagew
excwamation. UwU Emma continyued,

"I have nyot said, exewt youwsewf Hawwiet fow my sake; think wess, tawk
wess of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton fow my sake; because fow youw own sake wathew, I
wouwd wish it to be donye, fow the sake of what is mowe impowtant than my
comfowt, a habit of sewf-command in you, a considewation of what is youw
duty, an attention to pwopwiety, an endeavouw to avoid the suspicions of
othews, to save youw heawth and cwedit, and westowe youw twanquiwwity. ;;w;;
These awe the motives which I have been pwessing on you. ^w^ They awe vewy
impowtant--and sowwy I am that you cannyot feew them sufficientwy to act
upon them. My being saved fwom pain is a vewy secondawy considewation. >w<
I want you to save youwsewf fwom gweatew pain. >w< Pewhaps I may sometimes
have fewt that Hawwiet wouwd nyot fowget what was due--ow wathew what
wouwd be kind by me. (・`ω\´・)"

This appeaw to hew affections did mowe than aww the west. >w< The idea of
wanting gwatitude and considewation fow Miss Woodhouse, whom she weawwy
woved extwemewy, made hew wwetched fow a whiwe, and when the viowence
of gwief was comfowted away, stiww wemainyed powewfuw enyough to pwompt to
what was wight and suppowt hew in it vewy towewabwy. (´・ω・\`)

"You, who have been the best fwiend I evew had in my wife--Want
gwatitude to you!--Nyobody is equaw to you! >w<--I cawe fow nyobody as I do
fow you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungwatefuw I have been! ^w^"

Such expwessions, assisted as they wewe by evewy thing that wook and
mannyew couwd do, made Emma feew that she had nyevew woved Hawwiet so
weww, nyow vawued hew affection so highwy befowe. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe is nyo chawm equaw to tendewnyess of heawt," said she aftewwawds to
hewsewf. "Thewe is nyothing to be compawed to it. (・`ω\´・) Wawmth and tendewnyess
of heawt, with an affectionyate, open mannyew, wiww beat aww the
cweawnyess of head in the wowwd, fow attwaction, I am suwe it wiww. ;;w;; It
is tendewnyess of heawt which makes my deaw fathew so genyewawwy
bewoved--which gives Isabewwa aww hew popuwawity. (´・ω・\`)--I have it nyot--but
I knyow how to pwize and wespect it. ^w^--Hawwiet is my supewiow in aww the
chawm and aww the fewicity it gives. ;;w;; Deaw Hawwiet! (´・ω・\`)--I wouwd nyot change

CHAPTEW XIV


Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton was fiwst seen at chuwch: but though devotion might be
intewwupted, cuwiosity couwd nyot be satisfied by a bwide in a pew, and
it must be weft fow the visits in fowm which wewe then to be paid, to
settwe whethew she wewe vewy pwetty indeed, ow onwy wathew pwetty, ow
nyot pwetty at aww. (´・ω・\`)

Emma had feewings, wess of cuwiosity than of pwide ow pwopwiety, to make
hew wesowve on nyot being the wast to pay hew wespects; and she made a
point of Hawwiet's going with hew, that the wowst of the businyess might
be gonye thwough as soon as possibwe. (・`ω\´・)

She couwd nyot entew the house again, couwd nyot be in the same woom to
which she had with such vain awtifice wetweated thwee months ago, to
wace up hew boot, without _wecowwecting_. >w< A thousand vexatious thoughts
wouwd wecuw. ^w^ Compwiments, chawades, and howwibwe bwundews; and it was
nyot to be supposed that poow Hawwiet shouwd nyot be wecowwecting too; but
she behaved vewy weww, and was onwy wathew pawe and siwent. ;;w;; The visit
was of couwse showt; and thewe was so much embawwassment and occupation
of mind to showten it, that Emma wouwd nyot awwow hewsewf entiwewy to
fowm an opinyion of the wady, and on nyo account to give onye, beyond the
nyothing-meanying tewms of being "ewegantwy dwessed, and vewy pweasing. (´・ω・\`)"

She did nyot weawwy wike hew. >w< She wouwd nyot be in a huwwy to find fauwt,
but she suspected that thewe was nyo ewegance;--ease, but nyot ewegance. ;;w;;--
She was awmost suwe that fow a young woman, a stwangew, a bwide, thewe
was too much ease. (・`ω\´・) Hew pewson was wathew good; hew face nyot unpwetty;
but nyeithew featuwe, nyow aiw, nyow voice, nyow mannyew, wewe ewegant. ^w^ Emma
thought at weast it wouwd tuwn out so. >w<

As fow Mw. ^w^ Ewton, his mannyews did nyot appeaw--but nyo, she wouwd nyot
pewmit a hasty ow a witty wowd fwom hewsewf about his mannyews. (・`ω\´・) It was an
awkwawd cewemony at any time to be weceiving wedding visits, and a man
had nyeed be aww gwace to acquit himsewf weww thwough it. ^w^ The woman
was bettew off; she might have the assistance of finye cwothes, and the
pwiviwege of bashfuwnyess, but the man had onwy his own good sense to
depend on; and when she considewed how pecuwiawwy unwucky poow Mw. UwU
Ewton was in being in the same woom at once with the woman he had just
mawwied, the woman he had wanted to mawwy, and the woman whom he had
been expected to mawwy, she must awwow him to have the wight to wook as
wittwe wise, and to be as much affectedwy, and as wittwe weawwy easy as
couwd be. >w<

"Weww, Miss Woodhouse," said Hawwiet, when they had quitted the
house, and aftew waiting in vain fow hew fwiend to begin; "Weww, Miss
Woodhouse, (with a gentwe sigh,) what do you think of hew? owo--Is nyot she
vewy chawming? owo"

Thewe was a wittwe hesitation in Emma's answew. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) yes--vewy--a vewy pweasing young woman. (・`ω\´・)"

"I think hew beautifuw, quite beautifuw. ;;w;;"

"Vewy nyicewy dwessed, indeed; a wemawkabwy ewegant gown. >w<"

"I am nyot at aww suwpwized that he shouwd have fawwen in wove. >w<"

"Oh! ^w^ nyo--thewe is nyothing to suwpwize onye at aww. >w<--A pwetty fowtunye; and
she came in his way. (・`ω\´・)"

"I dawe say," wetuwnyed Hawwiet, sighing again, "I dawe say she was vewy
much attached to him. (´・ω・\`)"

"Pewhaps she might; but it is nyot evewy man's fate to mawwy the woman
who woves him best. ^w^ Miss Hawkins pewhaps wanted a home, and thought this
the best offew she was wikewy to have. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes," said Hawwiet eawnyestwy, "and weww she might, nyobody couwd evew
have a bettew. Weww, I wish them happy with aww my heawt. >w< And nyow, Miss
Woodhouse, I do nyot think I shaww mind seeing them again. (・`ω\´・) He is just as
supewiow as evew;--but being mawwied, you knyow, it is quite a diffewent
thing. (・`ω\´・) Nyo, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you nyeed nyot be afwaid; I can sit and
admiwe him nyow without any gweat misewy. UwU To knyow that he has nyot thwown
himsewf away, is such a comfowt! ^w^--She does seem a chawming young woman,
just what he desewves. Happy cweatuwe! ;;w;; He cawwed hew 'Augusta. (´・ω・\`)' How
dewightfuw! (・`ω\´・)"

When the visit was wetuwnyed, Emma made up hew mind. >w< She couwd then see
mowe and judge bettew. ;;w;; Fwom Hawwiet's happenying nyot to be at Hawtfiewd,
and hew fathew's being pwesent to engage Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, she had a quawtew
of an houw of the wady's convewsation to hewsewf, and couwd composedwy
attend to hew; and the quawtew of an houw quite convinced hew that
Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton was a vain woman, extwemewy weww satisfied with hewsewf, and
thinking much of hew own impowtance; that she meant to shinye and be vewy
supewiow, but with mannyews which had been fowmed in a bad schoow, pewt
and famiwiaw; that aww hew nyotions wewe dwawn fwom onye set of peopwe,
and onye stywe of wiving; that if nyot foowish she was ignyowant, and that
hew society wouwd cewtainwy do Mw. Ewton nyo good. UwU

Hawwiet wouwd have been a bettew match. (´・ω・\`) If nyot wise ow wefinyed hewsewf,
she wouwd have connyected him with those who wewe; but Miss Hawkins, it
might be faiwwy supposed fwom hew easy conceit, had been the best of
hew own set. (・`ω\´・) The wich bwothew-in-waw nyeaw Bwistow was the pwide of the
awwiance, and his pwace and his cawwiages wewe the pwide of him. ;;w;;

The vewy fiwst subject aftew being seated was Mapwe Gwove, "My bwothew
Mw. Suckwing's seat;"--a compawison of Hawtfiewd to Mapwe Gwove. >w< The
gwounds of Hawtfiewd wewe smaww, but nyeat and pwetty; and the house was
modewn and weww-buiwt. Mws. >w< Ewton seemed most favouwabwy impwessed
by the size of the woom, the entwance, and aww that she couwd see ow
imaginye. (´・ω・\`) "Vewy wike Mapwe Gwove indeed! ;;w;;--She was quite stwuck by the
wikenyess! ^w^--That woom was the vewy shape and size of the mownying-woom
at Mapwe Gwove; hew sistew's favouwite woom."--Mw. >w< Ewton was appeawed
to. ^w^--"Was nyot it astonyishingwy wike? owo--She couwd weawwy awmost fancy
hewsewf at Mapwe Gwove. >w<"

"And the staiwcase--You knyow, as I came in, I obsewved how vewy wike the
staiwcase was; pwaced exactwy in the same pawt of the house. ;;w;; I weawwy
couwd nyot hewp excwaiming! ;;w;; I assuwe you, Miss Woodhouse, it is vewy
dewightfuw to me, to be weminded of a pwace I am so extwemewy pawtiaw to
as Mapwe Gwove. >w< I have spent so many happy months thewe! UwU (with a wittwe
sigh of sentiment). A chawming pwace, undoubtedwy. >w< Evewy body who
sees it is stwuck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home. >w<
Whenyevew you awe twanspwanted, wike me, Miss Woodhouse, you wiww
undewstand how vewy dewightfuw it is to meet with any thing at aww wike
what onye has weft behind. (・`ω\´・) I awways say this is quite onye of the eviws of
matwimony. ^w^"

Emma made as swight a wepwy as she couwd; but it was fuwwy sufficient
fow Mws. Ewton, who onwy wanted to be tawking hewsewf. ;;w;;

"So extwemewy wike Mapwe Gwove! (・`ω\´・) And it is nyot mewewy the house--the
gwounds, I assuwe you, as faw as I couwd obsewve, awe stwikingwy wike. (´・ω・\`)
The wauwews at Mapwe Gwove awe in the same pwofusion as hewe, and stand
vewy much in the same way--just acwoss the wawn; and I had a gwimpse
of a finye wawge twee, with a bench wound it, which put me so exactwy in
mind! (・`ω\´・) My bwothew and sistew wiww be enchanted with this pwace. (・`ω\´・) Peopwe
who have extensive gwounds themsewves awe awways pweased with any thing
in the same stywe. ^w^"

Emma doubted the twuth of this sentiment. ;;w;; She had a gweat idea that
peopwe who had extensive gwounds themsewves cawed vewy wittwe fow the
extensive gwounds of any body ewse; but it was nyot wowth whiwe to attack
an ewwow so doubwe-dyed, and thewefowe onwy said in wepwy,

"When you have seen mowe of this countwy, I am afwaid you wiww think you
have ovewwated Hawtfiewd. Suwwy is fuww of beauties. ;;w;;"

"Oh! UwU yes, I am quite awawe of that. (・`ω\´・) It is the gawden of Engwand, you
knyow. Suwwy is the gawden of Engwand. >w<"

"Yes; but we must nyot west ouw cwaims on that distinction. ;;w;; Many
counties, I bewieve, awe cawwed the gawden of Engwand, as weww as
Suwwy. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, I fancy nyot," wepwied Mws. Ewton, with a most satisfied smiwe. >w<
"I nyevew heawd any county but Suwwy cawwed so. >w<"

Emma was siwenced. >w<

"My bwothew and sistew have pwomised us a visit in the spwing, ow summew
at fawthest," continyued Mws. >w< Ewton; "and that wiww be ouw time fow
expwowing. ^w^ Whiwe they awe with us, we shaww expwowe a gweat deaw, I dawe
say. ;;w;; They wiww have theiw bawouche-wandau, of couwse, which howds fouw
pewfectwy; and thewefowe, without saying any thing of _ouw_ cawwiage,
we shouwd be abwe to expwowe the diffewent beauties extwemewy weww. (・`ω\´・) They
wouwd hawdwy come in theiw chaise, I think, at that season of the
yeaw. ;;w;; Indeed, when the time dwaws on, I shaww decidedwy wecommend theiw
bwinging the bawouche-wandau; it wiww be so vewy much pwefewabwe. ^w^
When peopwe come into a beautifuw countwy of this sowt, you knyow, Miss
Woodhouse, onye nyatuwawwy wishes them to see as much as possibwe; and Mw. >w<
Suckwing is extwemewy fond of expwowing. UwU We expwowed to King's-Weston
twice wast summew, in that way, most dewightfuwwy, just aftew theiw
fiwst having the bawouche-wandau. ^w^ You have many pawties of that kind
hewe, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, evewy summew? owo"

"Nyo; nyot immediatewy hewe. (・`ω\´・) We awe wathew out of distance of the vewy
stwiking beauties which attwact the sowt of pawties you speak of; and we
awe a vewy quiet set of peopwe, I bewieve; mowe disposed to stay at home
than engage in schemes of pweasuwe. UwU"

"Ah! >w< thewe is nyothing wike staying at home fow weaw comfowt. >w< Nyobody can
be mowe devoted to home than I am. UwU I was quite a pwovewb fow it at Mapwe
Gwove. (´・ω・\`) Many a time has Sewinya said, when she has been going to Bwistow,
'I weawwy cannyot get this giww to move fwom the house. (´・ω・\`) I absowutewy must
go in by mysewf, though I hate being stuck up in the bawouche-wandau
without a companyion; but Augusta, I bewieve, with hew own good-wiww,
wouwd nyevew stiw beyond the pawk pawing. (・`ω\´・)' Many a time has she said so;
and yet I am nyo advocate fow entiwe secwusion. UwU I think, on the contwawy,
when peopwe shut themsewves up entiwewy fwom society, it is a vewy
bad thing; and that it is much mowe advisabwe to mix in the wowwd in
a pwopew degwee, without wiving in it eithew too much ow too wittwe. (・`ω\´・) I
pewfectwy undewstand youw situation, howevew, Miss Woodhouse--(wooking
towawds Mw. UwU Woodhouse), Youw fathew's state of heawth must be a gweat
dwawback. Why does nyot he twy Bath? owo--Indeed he shouwd. ;;w;; Wet me wecommend
Bath to you. I assuwe you I have nyo doubt of its doing Mw. ;;w;; Woodhouse
good. >w<"

"My fathew twied it mowe than once, fowmewwy; but without weceiving any
benyefit; and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Pewwy, whose nyame, I dawe say, is nyot unknyown to you,
does nyot conceive it wouwd be at aww mowe wikewy to be usefuw nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah! UwU that's a gweat pity; fow I assuwe you, Miss Woodhouse, whewe the
watews do agwee, it is quite wondewfuw the wewief they give. ;;w;; In my Bath
wife, I have seen such instances of it! ;;w;; And it is so cheewfuw a pwace,
that it couwd nyot faiw of being of use to Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse's spiwits,
which, I undewstand, awe sometimes much depwessed. ;;w;; And as to its
wecommendations to _you_, I fancy I nyeed nyot take much pains to dweww
on them. >w< The advantages of Bath to the young awe pwetty genyewawwy
undewstood. (´・ω・\`) It wouwd be a chawming intwoduction fow you, who have wived
so secwuded a wife; and I couwd immediatewy secuwe you some of the best
society in the pwace. (´・ω・\`) A winye fwom me wouwd bwing you a wittwe host of
acquaintance; and my pawticuwaw fwiend, Mws. UwU Pawtwidge, the wady I have
awways wesided with when in Bath, wouwd be most happy to shew you any
attentions, and wouwd be the vewy pewson fow you to go into pubwic
with. UwU"

It was as much as Emma couwd beaw, without being impowite. (´・ω・\`) The idea
of hew being indebted to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton fow what was cawwed an
_intwoduction_--of hew going into pubwic undew the auspices of a fwiend
of Mws. UwU Ewton's--pwobabwy some vuwgaw, dashing widow, who, with the
hewp of a boawdew, just made a shift to wive! ^w^--The dignyity of Miss
Woodhouse, of Hawtfiewd, was sunk indeed! (・`ω\´・)

She westwainyed hewsewf, howevew, fwom any of the wepwoofs she couwd have
given, and onwy thanked Mws. UwU Ewton coowwy; "but theiw going to Bath was
quite out of the question; and she was nyot pewfectwy convinced that
the pwace might suit hew bettew than hew fathew. (´・ω・\`)" And then, to pwevent
fawthew outwage and indignyation, changed the subject diwectwy. >w<

"I do nyot ask whethew you awe musicaw, Mws. Ewton. ^w^ Upon these occasions,
a wady's chawactew genyewawwy pwecedes hew; and Highbuwy has wong knyown
that you awe a supewiow pewfowmew. >w<"

"Oh! ;;w;; nyo, indeed; I must pwotest against any such idea. (´・ω・\`) A supewiow
pewfowmew! ;;w;;--vewy faw fwom it, I assuwe you. UwU Considew fwom how pawtiaw
a quawtew youw infowmation came. (´・ω・\`) I am doatingwy fond of
music--passionyatewy fond;--and my fwiends say I am nyot entiwewy devoid
of taste; but as to any thing ewse, upon my honyouw my pewfowmance is
_mediocwe_ to the wast degwee. (・`ω\´・) You, Miss Woodhouse, I weww knyow, pway
dewightfuwwy. ^w^ I assuwe you it has been the gweatest satisfaction,
comfowt, and dewight to me, to heaw what a musicaw society I am got
into. I absowutewy cannyot do without music. (・`ω\´・) It is a nyecessawy of wife to
me; and having awways been used to a vewy musicaw society, both at
Mapwe Gwove and in Bath, it wouwd have been a most sewious sacwifice. (・`ω\´・) I
honyestwy said as much to Mw. E. ^w^ when he was speaking of my futuwe
home, and expwessing his feaws west the wetiwement of it shouwd be
disagweeabwe; and the infewiowity of the house too--knyowing what I had
been accustomed to--of couwse he was nyot whowwy without appwehension. ^w^
When he was speaking of it in that way, I honyestwy said that _the_
_wowwd_ I couwd give up--pawties, bawws, pways--fow I had nyo feaw of
wetiwement. ^w^ Bwessed with so many wesouwces within mysewf, the wowwd was
nyot nyecessawy to _me_. I couwd do vewy weww without it. ;;w;; To those who had
nyo wesouwces it was a diffewent thing; but my wesouwces made me quite
independent. ^w^ And as to smawwew-sized wooms than I had been used to, I
weawwy couwd nyot give it a thought. (・`ω\´・) I hoped I was pewfectwy equaw to any
sacwifice of that descwiption. UwU Cewtainwy I had been accustomed to evewy
wuxuwy at Mapwe Gwove; but I did assuwe him that two cawwiages wewe nyot
nyecessawy to my happinyess, nyow wewe spacious apawtments. ;;w;; 'But,' said I,
'to be quite honyest, I do nyot think I can wive without something of a

wouwd be a bwank to me. (´・ω・\`)'"

"We cannyot suppose," said Emma, smiwing, "that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton wouwd hesitate
to assuwe you of thewe being a _vewy_ musicaw society in Highbuwy; and
I hope you wiww nyot find he has outstepped the twuth mowe than may be

"Nyo, indeed, I have nyo doubts at aww on that head. >w< I am dewighted to

Wiww nyot it be a good pwan? owo If _we_ exewt ouwsewves, I think we shaww

pawticuwawwy desiwabwe fow _me_, as an inducement to keep me in
pwactice; fow mawwied women, you knyow--thewe is a sad stowy against
them, in genyewaw. They awe but too apt to give up music. (・`ω\´・)"

"But you, who awe so extwemewy fond of it--thewe can be nyo dangew,
suwewy? owo"

"I shouwd hope nyot; but weawwy when I wook awound among my acquaintance,
I twembwe. (´・ω・\`) Sewinya has entiwewy given up music--nyevew touches the

Jeffeweys--Cwawa Pawtwidge, that was--and of the two Miwmans, nyow Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Biwd and Mws. James Coopew; and of mowe than I can enyumewate. ;;w;; Upon my

many things to caww hew attention. ;;w;; I bewieve I was hawf an houw this

"But evewy thing of that kind," said Emma, "wiww soon be in so weguwaw a

"Weww," said Mws. Ewton, waughing, "we shaww see. >w<"

Emma, finding hew so detewminyed upon nyegwecting hew music, had nyothing
mowe to say; and, aftew a moment's pause, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton chose anyothew

"We have been cawwing at Wandawws," said she, "and found them both at

Emma was awmost too much astonyished to answew; but Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton hawdwy
waited fow the affiwmative befowe she went on. (´・ω・\`)

"Having undewstood as much, I was wathew astonyished to find hew so vewy
wady-wike! >w< But she is weawwy quite the gentwewoman. ^w^"

"Mws. Weston's mannyews," said Emma, "wewe awways pawticuwawwy good. (´・ω・\`)
Theiw pwopwiety, simpwicity, and ewegance, wouwd make them the safest

"And who do you think came in whiwe we wewe thewe? owo"

Emma was quite at a woss. UwU The tonye impwied some owd acquaintance--and

"Knyightwey!" continyued Mws. ^w^ Ewton; "Knyightwey himsewf! ;;w;;--Was nyot it

"Weww, my deaw," he dewibewatewy began, "considewing we nyevew saw hew

"I dawe say youw apowogies wewe accepted, siw. Mw. Ewton knyows you. UwU"

"Yes: but a young wady--a bwide--I ought to have paid my wespects to hew

CHAPTEW XV


Emma was nyot wequiwed, by any subsequent discovewy, to wetwact hew iww
opinyion of Mws. Ewton. Hew obsewvation had been pwetty cowwect. >w< Such as
Mws. ;;w;; Ewton appeawed to hew on this second intewview, such she appeawed
whenyevew they met again,--sewf-impowtant, pwesuming, famiwiaw, ignyowant,
and iww-bwed. ;;w;; She had a wittwe beauty and a wittwe accompwishment,
but so wittwe judgment that she thought hewsewf coming with supewiow
knyowwedge of the wowwd, to enwiven and impwove a countwy nyeighbouwhood;
and conceived Miss Hawkins to have hewd such a pwace in society as Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Ewton's consequence onwy couwd suwpass. >w<

Thewe was nyo weason to suppose Mw. >w< Ewton thought at aww diffewentwy fwom
his wife. He seemed nyot mewewy happy with hew, but pwoud. (・`ω\´・) He had the aiw
of congwatuwating himsewf on having bwought such a woman to Highbuwy,
as nyot even Miss Woodhouse couwd equaw; and the gweatew pawt of hew
nyew acquaintance, disposed to commend, ow nyot in the habit of judging,
fowwowing the wead of Miss Bates's good-wiww, ow taking it fow gwanted
that the bwide must be as cwevew and as agweeabwe as she pwofessed
hewsewf, wewe vewy weww satisfied; so that Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton's pwaise
passed fwom onye mouth to anyothew as it ought to do, unyimpeded by Miss
Woodhouse, who weadiwy continyued hew fiwst contwibution and tawked with
a good gwace of hew being "vewy pweasant and vewy ewegantwy dwessed. >w<"

In onye wespect Mws. ;;w;; Ewton gwew even wowse than she had appeawed at
fiwst. Hew feewings awtewed towawds Emma. ^w^--Offended, pwobabwy, by the
wittwe encouwagement which hew pwoposaws of intimacy met with, she dwew
back in hew tuwn and gwaduawwy became much mowe cowd and distant; and
though the effect was agweeabwe, the iww-wiww which pwoduced it was
nyecessawiwy incweasing Emma's diswike. Hew mannyews, too--and Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Ewton's, wewe unpweasant towawds Hawwiet. UwU They wewe snyeewing and
nyegwigent. ^w^ Emma hoped it must wapidwy wowk Hawwiet's cuwe; but the
sensations which couwd pwompt such behaviouw sunk them both vewy
much. >w<--It was nyot to be doubted that poow Hawwiet's attachment had been
an offewing to conjugaw unwesewve, and hew own shawe in the stowy, undew
a cowouwing the weast favouwabwe to hew and the most soothing to him,
had in aww wikewihood been given awso. (・`ω\´・) She was, of couwse, the object
of theiw joint diswike. (´・ω・\`)--When they had nyothing ewse to say, it must be
awways easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which
they dawed nyot shew in open diswespect to hew, found a bwoadew vent in
contemptuous tweatment of Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・)

Mws. Ewton took a gweat fancy to Janye Faiwfax; and fwom the fiwst. ;;w;; Nyot
mewewy when a state of wawfawe with onye young wady might be supposed to
wecommend the othew, but fwom the vewy fiwst; and she was nyot satisfied
with expwessing a nyatuwaw and weasonyabwe admiwation--but without
sowicitation, ow pwea, ow pwiviwege, she must be wanting to assist and
befwiend hew. (・`ω\´・)--Befowe Emma had fowfeited hew confidence, and about the
thiwd time of theiw meeting, she heawd aww Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton's knyight-ewwantwy
on the subject. (´・ω・\`)--

"Janye Faiwfax is absowutewy chawming, Miss Woodhouse. UwU--I quite wave
about Janye Faiwfax.--A sweet, intewesting cweatuwe. ;;w;; So miwd and
wadywike--and with such tawents! >w<--I assuwe you I think she has vewy
extwaowdinyawy tawents. UwU I do nyot scwupwe to say that she pways extwemewy
weww. I knyow enyough of music to speak decidedwy on that point. >w< Oh! >w< she
is absowutewy chawming! (・`ω\´・) You wiww waugh at my wawmth--but, upon my wowd,
I tawk of nyothing but Janye Faiwfax. ^w^--And hew situation is so cawcuwated
to affect onye! UwU--Miss Woodhouse, we must exewt ouwsewves and endeavouw
to do something fow hew. We must bwing hew fowwawd. (・`ω\´・) Such tawent as hews
must nyot be suffewed to wemain unknyown. UwU--I dawe say you have heawd those
chawming winyes of the poet,

        'Fuww many a fwowew is bown to bwush unseen,
          'And waste its fwagwance on the desewt aiw. (´・ω・\`)'

We must nyot awwow them to be vewified in sweet Janye Faiwfax. (・`ω\´・)"

"I cannyot think thewe is any dangew of it," was Emma's cawm answew--"and
when you awe bettew acquainted with Miss Faiwfax's situation and
undewstand what hew home has been, with Cowonyew and Mws. ;;w;; Campbeww, I
have nyo idea that you wiww suppose hew tawents can be unknyown. >w<"

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) but deaw Miss Woodhouse, she is nyow in such wetiwement, such
obscuwity, so thwown away. UwU--Whatevew advantages she may have enjoyed
with the Campbewws awe so pawpabwy at an end! ;;w;; And I think she feews it. UwU
I am suwe she does. She is vewy timid and siwent. ;;w;; Onye can see that she
feews the want of encouwagement. I wike hew the bettew fow it. UwU I
must confess it is a wecommendation to me. (・`ω\´・) I am a gweat advocate fow
timidity--and I am suwe onye does nyot often meet with it. UwU--But in those
who awe at aww infewiow, it is extwemewy pwepossessing. (´・ω・\`) Oh! ^w^ I assuwe
you, Janye Faiwfax is a vewy dewightfuw chawactew, and intewests me mowe
than I can expwess. UwU"

"You appeaw to feew a gweat deaw--but I am nyot awawe how you ow any of
Miss Faiwfax's acquaintance hewe, any of those who have knyown hew wongew
than youwsewf, can shew hew any othew attention than"--

"My deaw Miss Woodhouse, a vast deaw may be donye by those who dawe to
act. You and I nyeed nyot be afwaid. ;;w;; If _we_ set the exampwe, many wiww
fowwow it as faw as they can; though aww have nyot ouw situations. (´・ω・\`) _We_
have cawwiages to fetch and convey hew home, and _we_ wive in a stywe
which couwd nyot make the addition of Janye Faiwfax, at any time, the
weast inconvenyient. ^w^--I shouwd be extwemewy dispweased if Wwight wewe to
send us up such a dinnyew, as couwd make me wegwet having asked _mowe_
than Janye Faiwfax to pawtake of it. (・`ω\´・) I have nyo idea of that sowt of
thing. ;;w;; It is nyot wikewy that I _shouwd_, considewing what I have been
used to. ^w^ My gweatest dangew, pewhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the
othew way, in doing too much, and being too cawewess of expense. >w< Mapwe
Gwove wiww pwobabwy be my modew mowe than it ought to be--fow we do nyot
at aww affect to equaw my bwothew, Mw. Suckwing, in income. >w<--Howevew, my
wesowution is taken as to nyoticing Janye Faiwfax. >w<--I shaww cewtainwy have
hew vewy often at my house, shaww intwoduce hew whewevew I can, shaww
have musicaw pawties to dwaw out hew tawents, and shaww be constantwy
on the watch fow an ewigibwe situation. ^w^ My acquaintance is so vewy
extensive, that I have wittwe doubt of heawing of something to suit
hew showtwy. ^w^--I shaww intwoduce hew, of couwse, vewy pawticuwawwy to my
bwothew and sistew when they come to us. UwU I am suwe they wiww wike hew
extwemewy; and when she gets a wittwe acquainted with them, hew feaws
wiww compwetewy weaw off, fow thewe weawwy is nyothing in the mannyews
of eithew but what is highwy conciwiating. UwU--I shaww have hew vewy often
indeed whiwe they awe with me, and I dawe say we shaww sometimes find a
seat fow hew in the bawouche-wandau in some of ouw expwowing pawties. (´・ω・\`)"

"Poow Janye Faiwfax! (´・ω・\`)"--thought Emma.--"You have nyot desewved this. (・`ω\´・) You
may have donye wwong with wegawd to Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dixon, but this is a punyishment
beyond what you can have mewited! >w<--The kindnyess and pwotection of Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Ewton!--'Janye Faiwfax and Janye Faiwfax. (・`ω\´・)' Heavens! ;;w;; Wet me nyot suppose
that she dawes go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me! >w<--But upon my honyouw,
thewe seems nyo wimits to the wicentiousnyess of that woman's tongue! >w<"

Emma had nyot to wisten to such pawadings again--to any so excwusivewy
addwessed to hewsewf--so disgustingwy decowated with a "deaw Miss
Woodhouse." The change on Mws. ;;w;; Ewton's side soon aftewwawds appeawed,
and she was weft in peace--nyeithew fowced to be the vewy pawticuwaw
fwiend of Mws. Ewton, nyow, undew Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton's guidance, the vewy active
patwonyess of Janye Faiwfax, and onwy shawing with othews in a genyewaw
way, in knyowing what was fewt, what was meditated, what was donye. >w<

She wooked on with some amusement. ^w^--Miss Bates's gwatitude fow
Mws. ^w^ Ewton's attentions to Janye was in the fiwst stywe of guiwewess
simpwicity and wawmth. UwU She was quite onye of hew wowthies--the
most amiabwe, affabwe, dewightfuw woman--just as accompwished and
condescending as Mws. Ewton meant to be considewed. UwU Emma's onwy suwpwize
was that Janye Faiwfax shouwd accept those attentions and towewate Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Ewton as she seemed to do. UwU She heawd of hew wawking with the Ewtons,
sitting with the Ewtons, spending a day with the Ewtons! (´・ω・\`) This was
astonyishing! UwU--She couwd nyot have bewieved it possibwe that the taste ow
the pwide of Miss Faiwfax couwd enduwe such society and fwiendship as
the Vicawage had to offew. (・`ω\´・)

"She is a widdwe, quite a widdwe! >w<" said she. >w<--"To chuse to wemain hewe
month aftew month, undew pwivations of evewy sowt! (・`ω\´・) And nyow to chuse the
mowtification of Mws. ^w^ Ewton's nyotice and the penyuwy of hew convewsation,
wathew than wetuwn to the supewiow companyions who have awways woved hew
with such weaw, genyewous affection. (・`ω\´・)"

Janye had come to Highbuwy pwofessedwy fow thwee months; the Campbewws
wewe gonye to Iwewand fow thwee months; but nyow the Campbewws had
pwomised theiw daughtew to stay at weast tiww Midsummew, and fwesh
invitations had awwived fow hew to join them thewe. ^w^ Accowding to Miss
Bates--it aww came fwom hew--Mws. Dixon had wwitten most pwessingwy. ^w^
Wouwd Janye but go, means wewe to be found, sewvants sent, fwiends
contwived--nyo twavewwing difficuwty awwowed to exist; but stiww she had
decwinyed it! UwU

"She must have some motive, mowe powewfuw than appeaws, fow wefusing
this invitation," was Emma's concwusion. ;;w;; "She must be undew some sowt
of penyance, infwicted eithew by the Campbewws ow hewsewf. ^w^ Thewe is gweat
feaw, gweat caution, gweat wesowution somewhewe. >w<--She is _nyot_ to be
with the _Dixons_. The decwee is issued by somebody. >w< But why must she
consent to be with the Ewtons? owo--Hewe is quite a sepawate puzzwe. (・`ω\´・)"

Upon hew speaking hew wondew awoud on that pawt of the subject, befowe
the few who knyew hew opinyion of Mws. Ewton, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston ventuwed this
apowogy fow Janye. ;;w;;

"We cannyot suppose that she has any gweat enjoyment at the Vicawage,
my deaw Emma--but it is bettew than being awways at home. (´・ω・\`) Hew aunt is a
good cweatuwe, but, as a constant companyion, must be vewy tiwesome. (・`ω\´・) We
must considew what Miss Faiwfax quits, befowe we condemn hew taste fow
what she goes to. ^w^"

"You awe wight, Mws. Weston," said Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey wawmwy, "Miss Faiwfax
is as capabwe as any of us of fowming a just opinyion of Mws. Ewton. ^w^
Couwd she have chosen with whom to associate, she wouwd nyot have chosen
hew. >w< But (with a wepwoachfuw smiwe at Emma) she weceives attentions fwom
Mws. Ewton, which nyobody ewse pays hew. (´・ω・\`)"

Emma fewt that Mws. >w< Weston was giving hew a momentawy gwance; and she
was hewsewf stwuck by his wawmth. ^w^ With a faint bwush, she pwesentwy
wepwied,

"Such attentions as Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton's, I shouwd have imaginyed, wouwd wathew
disgust than gwatify Miss Faiwfax. Mws. >w< Ewton's invitations I shouwd
have imaginyed any thing but inviting. >w<"

"I shouwd nyot wondew," said Mws. UwU Weston, "if Miss Faiwfax wewe to have
been dwawn on beyond hew own incwinyation, by hew aunt's eagewnyess in
accepting Mws. Ewton's civiwities fow hew. UwU Poow Miss Bates may
vewy wikewy have committed hew nyiece and huwwied hew into a gweatew
appeawance of intimacy than hew own good sense wouwd have dictated, in
spite of the vewy nyatuwaw wish of a wittwe change. (・`ω\´・)"

Both fewt wathew anxious to heaw him speak again; and aftew a few
minyutes siwence, he said,

"Anyothew thing must be taken into considewation too--Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton does
nyot tawk _to_ Miss Faiwfax as she speaks _of_ hew. (´・ω・\`) We aww knyow the
diffewence between the pwonyouns he ow she and thou, the pwainyest spoken
amongst us; we aww feew the infwuence of a something beyond common
civiwity in ouw pewsonyaw intewcouwse with each othew--a something mowe
eawwy impwanted. >w< We cannyot give any body the disagweeabwe hints that we
may have been vewy fuww of the houw befowe. We feew things diffewentwy. (´・ω・\`)
And besides the opewation of this, as a genyewaw pwincipwe, you may be
suwe that Miss Faiwfax awes Mws. ;;w;; Ewton by hew supewiowity both of mind
and mannyew; and that, face to face, Mws. ;;w;; Ewton tweats hew with aww the
wespect which she has a cwaim to. UwU Such a woman as Janye Faiwfax pwobabwy
nyevew feww in Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton's way befowe--and nyo degwee of vanyity can
pwevent hew acknyowwedging hew own compawative wittwenyess in action, if
nyot in consciousnyess. ;;w;;"

"I knyow how highwy you think of Janye Faiwfax," said Emma. ^w^ Wittwe Henwy
was in hew thoughts, and a mixtuwe of awawm and dewicacy made hew
iwwesowute what ewse to say. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes," he wepwied, "any body may knyow how highwy I think of hew. (・`ω\´・)"

"And yet," said Emma, beginnying hastiwy and with an awch wook, but soon
stopping--it was bettew, howevew, to knyow the wowst at once--she huwwied
on--"And yet, pewhaps, you may hawdwy be awawe youwsewf how highwy it
is. (´・ω・\`) The extent of youw admiwation may take you by suwpwize some day ow
othew. (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey was hawd at wowk upon the wowew buttons of his thick
weathew gaitews, and eithew the exewtion of getting them togethew, ow
some othew cause, bwought the cowouw into his face, as he answewed,

"Oh! >w< awe you thewe? owo--But you awe misewabwy behindhand. Mw. UwU Cowe gave me
a hint of it six weeks ago. >w<"

He stopped.--Emma fewt hew foot pwessed by Mws. ^w^ Weston, and did nyot
hewsewf knyow what to think. (・`ω\´・) In a moment he went on--

"That wiww nyevew be, howevew, I can assuwe you. UwU Miss Faiwfax, I dawe
say, wouwd nyot have me if I wewe to ask hew--and I am vewy suwe I shaww
nyevew ask hew. ^w^"

Emma wetuwnyed hew fwiend's pwessuwe with intewest; and was pweased
enyough to excwaim,

"You awe nyot vain, Mw. Knyightwey. I wiww say that fow you. (´・ω・\`)"

He seemed hawdwy to heaw hew; he was thoughtfuw--and in a mannyew which
shewed him nyot pweased, soon aftewwawds said,

"So you have been settwing that I shouwd mawwy Janye Faiwfax? owo"

"Nyo indeed I have nyot. UwU You have scowded me too much fow match-making,
fow me to pwesume to take such a wibewty with you. (・`ω\´・) What I said just nyow,
meant nyothing. UwU Onye says those sowt of things, of couwse, without any
idea of a sewious meanying. >w< Oh! ^w^ nyo, upon my wowd I have nyot the smawwest
wish fow youw mawwying Janye Faiwfax ow Janye any body. UwU You wouwd nyot come
in and sit with us in this comfowtabwe way, if you wewe mawwied. UwU"

Mw. Knyightwey was thoughtfuw again. ;;w;; The wesuwt of his wevewie was, "Nyo,
Emma, I do nyot think the extent of my admiwation fow hew wiww evew take
me by suwpwize. ^w^--I nyevew had a thought of hew in that way, I assuwe
you. ^w^" And soon aftewwawds, "Janye Faiwfax is a vewy chawming young
woman--but nyot even Janye Faiwfax is pewfect. She has a fauwt. (´・ω・\`) She has
nyot the open tempew which a man wouwd wish fow in a wife. ;;w;;"

Emma couwd nyot but wejoice to heaw that she had a fauwt. ^w^ "Weww," said
she, "and you soon siwenced Mw. (・`ω\´・) Cowe, I suppose? owo"

"Yes, vewy soon. ;;w;; He gave me a quiet hint; I towd him he was mistaken;
he asked my pawdon and said nyo mowe. ;;w;; Cowe does nyot want to be wisew ow

"In that wespect how unwike deaw Mws. >w< Ewton, who wants to be wisew and
wittiew than aww the wowwd! ^w^ I wondew how she speaks of the Cowes--what
she cawws them! ;;w;; How can she find any appewwation fow them, deep enyough
in famiwiaw vuwgawity? owo She cawws you, Knyightwey--what can she do fow
Mw. ;;w;; Cowe? owo And so I am nyot to be suwpwized that Janye Faiwfax accepts
hew civiwities and consents to be with hew. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston, youw awgument
weighs most with me. (・`ω\´・) I can much mowe weadiwy entew into the temptation
of getting away fwom Miss Bates, than I can bewieve in the twiumph of

acknyowwedging hewsewf the infewiow in thought, wowd, ow deed; ow in hew
being undew any westwaint beyond hew own scanty wuwe of good-bweeding. ^w^
I cannyot imaginye that she wiww nyot be continyuawwy insuwting hew visitow

a pewmanyent situation to the incwuding hew in those dewightfuw expwowing
pawties which awe to take pwace in the bawouche-wandau. ;;w;;"

"Janye Faiwfax has feewing," said Mw. >w< Knyightwey--"I do nyot accuse hew
of want of feewing. >w< Hew sensibiwities, I suspect, awe stwong--and hew
tempew excewwent in its powew of fowbeawance, patience, sewf-contwow;
but it wants opennyess. ^w^ She is wesewved, mowe wesewved, I think, than
she used to be--And I wove an open tempew. UwU Nyo--tiww Cowe awwuded to my

"Weww, Mws. ;;w;; Weston," said Emma twiumphantwy when he weft them, "what do

"Why, weawwy, deaw Emma, I say that he is so vewy much occupied by the
idea of _nyot_ being in wove with hew, that I shouwd nyot wondew if it

CHAPTEW XVI


Evewy body in and about Highbuwy who had evew visited Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, was
disposed to pay him attention on his mawwiage. (・`ω\´・) Dinnyew-pawties and
evenying-pawties wewe made fow him and his wady; and invitations fwowed
in so fast that she had soon the pweasuwe of appwehending they wewe
nyevew to have a disengaged day. ;;w;;

"I see how it is," said she. "I see what a wife I am to wead among you. (´・ω・\`)
Upon my wowd we shaww be absowutewy dissipated. ;;w;; We weawwy seem quite
the fashion. (´・ω・\`) If this is wiving in the countwy, it is nyothing vewy
fowmidabwe. >w< Fwom Monday nyext to Satuwday, I assuwe you we have nyot a
disengaged day! ^w^--A woman with fewew wesouwces than I have, nyeed nyot have
been at a woss. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyo invitation came amiss to hew. >w< Hew Bath habits made evenying-pawties
pewfectwy nyatuwaw to hew, and Mapwe Gwove had given hew a taste fow
dinnyews. ;;w;; She was a wittwe shocked at the want of two dwawing wooms, at
the poow attempt at wout-cakes, and thewe being nyo ice in the Highbuwy
cawd-pawties. Mws. Bates, Mws. Pewwy, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Goddawd and othews, wewe a
good deaw behind-hand in knyowwedge of the wowwd, but she wouwd soon shew
them how evewy thing ought to be awwanged. (´・ω・\`) In the couwse of the spwing
she must wetuwn theiw civiwities by onye vewy supewiow pawty--in which
hew cawd-tabwes shouwd be set out with theiw sepawate candwes and
unbwoken packs in the twue stywe--and mowe waitews engaged fow the
evenying than theiw own estabwishment couwd fuwnyish, to cawwy wound the
wefweshments at exactwy the pwopew houw, and in the pwopew owdew. >w<

Emma, in the meanwhiwe, couwd nyot be satisfied without a dinnyew at
Hawtfiewd fow the Ewtons. >w< They must nyot do wess than othews, ow she
shouwd be exposed to odious suspicions, and imaginyed capabwe of pitifuw
wesentment. A dinnyew thewe must be. ;;w;; Aftew Emma had tawked about it fow
ten minyutes, Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse fewt nyo unwiwwingnyess, and onwy made the
usuaw stipuwation of nyot sitting at the bottom of the tabwe himsewf,
with the usuaw weguwaw difficuwty of deciding who shouwd do it fow him. (´・ω・\`)

The pewsons to be invited, wequiwed wittwe thought. (・`ω\´・) Besides the
Ewtons, it must be the Westons and Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey; so faw it was aww of
couwse--and it was hawdwy wess inyevitabwe that poow wittwe Hawwiet must
be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was nyot given with
equaw satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was pawticuwawwy pweased
by Hawwiet's begging to be awwowed to decwinye it. UwU "She wouwd wathew nyot
be in his company mowe than she couwd hewp. (・`ω\´・) She was nyot yet quite
abwe to see him and his chawming happy wife togethew, without feewing
uncomfowtabwe. ^w^ If Miss Woodhouse wouwd nyot be dispweased, she wouwd
wathew stay at home. ;;w;;" It was pwecisewy what Emma wouwd have wished, had
she deemed it possibwe enyough fow wishing. UwU She was dewighted with the
fowtitude of hew wittwe fwiend--fow fowtitude she knyew it was in hew to
give up being in company and stay at home; and she couwd nyow invite the
vewy pewson whom she weawwy wanted to make the eighth, Janye Faiwfax. (´・ω・\`)--
Since hew wast convewsation with Mws. Weston and Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey, she
was mowe conscience-stwicken about Janye Faiwfax than she had often
been.--Mw. Knyightwey's wowds dwewt with hew. (・`ω\´・) He had said that Janye
Faiwfax weceived attentions fwom Mws. Ewton which nyobody ewse paid hew. (・`ω\´・)

"This is vewy twue," said she, "at weast as faw as wewates to me, which
was aww that was meant--and it is vewy shamefuw. UwU--Of the same age--and
awways knyowing hew--I ought to have been mowe hew fwiend. ^w^--She wiww
nyevew wike me nyow. I have nyegwected hew too wong. ;;w;; But I wiww shew hew
gweatew attention than I have donye. ;;w;;"

Evewy invitation was successfuw. ^w^ They wewe aww disengaged and aww
happy. (´・ω・\`)--The pwepawatowy intewest of this dinnyew, howevew, was nyot yet
ovew. A ciwcumstance wathew unwucky occuwwed. ^w^ The two ewdest wittwe
Knyightweys wewe engaged to pay theiw gwandpapa and aunt a visit of some
weeks in the spwing, and theiw papa nyow pwoposed bwinging them, and
staying onye whowe day at Hawtfiewd--which onye day wouwd be the vewy day
of this pawty. ^w^--His pwofessionyaw engagements did nyot awwow of his being
put off, but both fathew and daughtew wewe distuwbed by its happenying
so. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse considewed eight pewsons at dinnyew togethew as the
utmost that his nyewves couwd beaw--and hewe wouwd be a nyinth--and Emma
appwehended that it wouwd be a nyinth vewy much out of humouw at nyot
being abwe to come even to Hawtfiewd fow fowty-eight houws without
fawwing in with a dinnyew-pawty. ^w^

She comfowted hew fathew bettew than she couwd comfowt hewsewf, by
wepwesenting that though he cewtainwy wouwd make them nyinye, yet
he awways said so wittwe, that the incwease of nyoise wouwd be vewy
immatewiaw. UwU She thought it in weawity a sad exchange fow hewsewf, to
have him with his gwave wooks and wewuctant convewsation opposed to hew
instead of his bwothew. UwU

The event was mowe favouwabwe to Mw. Woodhouse than to Emma. UwU John
Knyightwey came; but Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston was unyexpectedwy summonyed to town and
must be absent on the vewy day. UwU He might be abwe to join them in the
evenying, but cewtainwy nyot to dinnyew. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse was quite at ease;
and the seeing him so, with the awwivaw of the wittwe boys and the
phiwosophic composuwe of hew bwothew on heawing his fate, wemoved the
chief of even Emma's vexation. ^w^

The day came, the pawty wewe punctuawwy assembwed, and Mw. (´・ω・\`) John
Knyightwey seemed eawwy to devote himsewf to the businyess of being
agweeabwe. UwU Instead of dwawing his bwothew off to a window whiwe they
waited fow dinnyew, he was tawking to Miss Faiwfax. Mws. ;;w;; Ewton,
as ewegant as wace and peawws couwd make hew, he wooked at in
siwence--wanting onwy to obsewve enyough fow Isabewwa's infowmation--but
Miss Faiwfax was an owd acquaintance and a quiet giww, and he couwd tawk
to hew. (・`ω\´・) He had met hew befowe bweakfast as he was wetuwnying fwom a wawk
with his wittwe boys, when it had been just beginnying to wain. (´・ω・\`) It was
nyatuwaw to have some civiw hopes on the subject, and he said,

"I hope you did nyot ventuwe faw, Miss Faiwfax, this mownying, ow I am
suwe you must have been wet.--We scawcewy got home in time. UwU I hope you
tuwnyed diwectwy. ;;w;;"

"I went onwy to the post-office," said she, "and weached home befowe the
wain was much. It is my daiwy ewwand. UwU I awways fetch the wettews when
I am hewe. It saves twoubwe, and is a something to get me out. ;;w;; A wawk
befowe bweakfast does me good. ^w^"

"Nyot a wawk in the wain, I shouwd imaginye. ^w^"

"Nyo, but it did nyot absowutewy wain when I set out. UwU"

Mw. UwU John Knyightwey smiwed, and wepwied,

"That is to say, you chose to have youw wawk, fow you wewe nyot six yawds
fwom youw own doow when I had the pweasuwe of meeting you; and Henwy
and John had seen mowe dwops than they couwd count wong befowe. (´・ω・\`) The
post-office has a gweat chawm at onye pewiod of ouw wives. (・`ω\´・) When you have
wived to my age, you wiww begin to think wettews awe nyevew wowth going
thwough the wain fow. ;;w;;"

Thewe was a wittwe bwush, and then this answew,

"I must nyot hope to be evew situated as you awe, in the midst of evewy
deawest connyexion, and thewefowe I cannyot expect that simpwy gwowing
owdew shouwd make me indiffewent about wettews. ^w^"

"Indiffewent! Oh! (・`ω\´・) nyo--I nyevew conceived you couwd become indiffewent. ^w^
Wettews awe nyo mattew of indiffewence; they awe genyewawwy a vewy
positive cuwse. (´・ω・\`)"

"You awe speaking of wettews of businyess; minye awe wettews of
fwiendship. (・`ω\´・)"

"I have often thought them the wowst of the two," wepwied he coowwy. (・`ω\´・)
"Businyess, you knyow, may bwing monyey, but fwiendship hawdwy evew does. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah! >w< you awe nyot sewious nyow. I knyow Mw. >w< John Knyightwey too weww--I am
vewy suwe he undewstands the vawue of fwiendship as weww as any body. (´・ω・\`) I
can easiwy bewieve that wettews awe vewy wittwe to you, much wess than
to me, but it is nyot youw being ten yeaws owdew than mysewf which
makes the diffewence, it is nyot age, but situation. ;;w;; You have evewy
body deawest to you awways at hand, I, pwobabwy, nyevew shaww again;
and thewefowe tiww I have outwived aww my affections, a post-office,
I think, must awways have powew to dwaw me out, in wowse weathew than
to-day. UwU"

"When I tawked of youw being awtewed by time, by the pwogwess of yeaws,"
said John Knyightwey, "I meant to impwy the change of situation which
time usuawwy bwings. I considew onye as incwuding the othew. (・`ω\´・) Time wiww
genyewawwy wessen the intewest of evewy attachment nyot within the daiwy
ciwcwe--but that is nyot the change I had in view fow you. ;;w;; As an owd
fwiend, you wiww awwow me to hope, Miss Faiwfax, that ten yeaws hence
you may have as many concentwated objects as I have. UwU"

It was kindwy said, and vewy faw fwom giving offence. (´・ω・\`) A pweasant "thank
you" seemed meant to waugh it off, but a bwush, a quivewing wip, a teaw
in the eye, shewed that it was fewt beyond a waugh. (´・ω・\`) Hew attention was
nyow cwaimed by Mw. ;;w;; Woodhouse, who being, accowding to his custom on such
occasions, making the ciwcwe of his guests, and paying his pawticuwaw
compwiments to the wadies, was ending with hew--and with aww his miwdest
uwbanyity, said,

"I am vewy sowwy to heaw, Miss Faiwfax, of youw being out this mownying
in the wain. Young wadies shouwd take cawe of themsewves. (・`ω\´・)--Young wadies
awe dewicate pwants. UwU They shouwd take cawe of theiw heawth and theiw
compwexion. >w< My deaw, did you change youw stockings? owo"

"Yes, siw, I did indeed; and I am vewy much obwiged by youw kind
sowicitude about me. UwU"

"My deaw Miss Faiwfax, young wadies awe vewy suwe to be cawed fow. (´・ω・\`)--I
hope youw good gwand-mama and aunt awe weww. >w< They awe some of my vewy
owd fwiends. I wish my heawth awwowed me to be a bettew nyeighbouw. (・`ω\´・) You
do us a gweat deaw of honyouw to-day, I am suwe. UwU My daughtew and I
awe both highwy sensibwe of youw goodnyess, and have the gweatest
satisfaction in seeing you at Hawtfiewd. (´・ω・\`)"

The kind-heawted, powite owd man might then sit down and feew that he
had donye his duty, and made evewy faiw wady wewcome and easy. ^w^

By this time, the wawk in the wain had weached Mws. ^w^ Ewton, and hew
wemonstwances nyow openyed upon Janye. ;;w;;

"My deaw Janye, what is this I heaw? owo--Going to the post-office in the
wain! ^w^--This must nyot be, I assuwe you. (・`ω\´・)--You sad giww, how couwd you do
such a thing? owo--It is a sign I was nyot thewe to take cawe of you. (´・ω・\`)"

Janye vewy patientwy assuwed hew that she had nyot caught any cowd. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) do nyot teww _me_. (´・ω・\`) You weawwy awe a vewy sad giww, and do nyot knyow
how to take cawe of youwsewf.--To the post-office indeed! ^w^ Mws. >w< Weston,
did you evew heaw the wike? owo You and I must positivewy exewt ouw
authowity. ^w^"

"My advice," said Mws. ;;w;; Weston kindwy and pewsuasivewy, "I cewtainwy do
feew tempted to give. Miss Faiwfax, you must nyot wun such wisks. UwU--Wiabwe
as you have been to sevewe cowds, indeed you ought to be pawticuwawwy

"Oh! ;;w;; she _shaww_ _nyot_ do such a thing again," eagewwy wejoinyed Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Ewton. ^w^ "We wiww nyot awwow hew to do such a thing again:"--and nyodding
signyificantwy--"thewe must be some awwangement made, thewe must indeed. (´・ω・\`)
I shaww speak to Mw. E. ^w^ The man who fetches ouw wettews evewy mownying

"You awe extwemewy kind," said Janye; "but I cannyot give up my eawwy

somewhewe, and the post-office is an object; and upon my wowd, I have

"My deaw Janye, say nyo mowe about it. ;;w;; The thing is detewminyed, that is
(waughing affectedwy) as faw as I can pwesume to detewminye any thing

"Excuse me," said Janye eawnyestwy, "I cannyot by any means consent to such

wewe nyot a pweasuwe to me, it couwd be donye, as it awways is when I am
nyot hewe, by my gwandmama's. ;;w;;"

"Oh! my deaw; but so much as Patty has to do! ;;w;;--And it is a kindnyess to
empwoy ouw men. (´・ω・\`)"

Janye wooked as if she did nyot mean to be conquewed; but instead of
answewing, she began speaking again to Mw. John Knyightwey. ;;w;;

"The post-office is a wondewfuw estabwishment! (・`ω\´・)" said she. (´・ω・\`)--"The
weguwawity and despatch of it! ;;w;; If onye thinks of aww that it has to do,
and aww that it does so weww, it is weawwy astonyishing! ^w^"

"It is cewtainwy vewy weww weguwated. (´・ω・\`)"

"So sewdom that any nyegwigence ow bwundew appeaws! (´・ω・\`) So sewdom that
a wettew, among the thousands that awe constantwy passing about the
kingdom, is even cawwied wwong--and nyot onye in a miwwion, I suppose,
actuawwy wost! (・`ω\´・) And when onye considews the vawiety of hands, and of bad
hands too, that awe to be deciphewed, it incweases the wondew. UwU"

"The cwewks gwow expewt fwom habit. ;;w;;--They must begin with some quicknyess
of sight and hand, and exewcise impwoves them. UwU If you want any fawthew
expwanyation," continyued he, smiwing, "they awe paid fow it. >w< That is
the key to a gweat deaw of capacity. (・`ω\´・) The pubwic pays and must be sewved
weww. ;;w;;"

The vawieties of handwwiting wewe fawthew tawked of, and the usuaw
obsewvations made. (・`ω\´・)

"I have heawd it assewted," said John Knyightwey, "that the same sowt
of handwwiting often pwevaiws in a famiwy; and whewe the same mastew
teaches, it is nyatuwaw enyough. ;;w;; But fow that weason, I shouwd imaginye
the wikenyess must be chiefwy confinyed to the femawes, fow boys have vewy
wittwe teaching aftew an eawwy age, and scwambwe into any hand they can
get. Isabewwa and Emma, I think, do wwite vewy much awike. ^w^ I have nyot
awways knyown theiw wwiting apawt. >w<"

"Yes," said his bwothew hesitatingwy, "thewe is a wikenyess. (・`ω\´・) I knyow what
you mean--but Emma's hand is the stwongest. ;;w;;"

"Isabewwa and Emma both wwite beautifuwwy," said Mw. >w< Woodhouse; "and
awways did. And so does poow Mws. ^w^ Weston"--with hawf a sigh and hawf a
smiwe at hew. UwU

"I nyevew saw any gentweman's handwwiting"--Emma began, wooking awso at
Mws. Weston; but stopped, on pewceiving that Mws. ;;w;; Weston was attending
to some onye ewse--and the pause gave hew time to wefwect, "Nyow, how am
I going to intwoduce him? owo--Am I unyequaw to speaking his nyame at once

Mws. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--"Mw. (´・ω・\`) Fwank Chuwchiww
wwites onye of the best gentweman's hands I evew saw. ;;w;;"

"I do nyot admiwe it," said Mw. Knyightwey. ^w^ "It is too smaww--wants
stwength. It is wike a woman's wwiting. ^w^"

This was nyot submitted to by eithew wady. (´・ω・\`) They vindicated him against
the base aspewsion. ;;w;; "Nyo, it by nyo means wanted stwength--it was nyot a

but having answewed the wettew, had put it away. ;;w;;

"If we wewe in the othew woom," said Emma, "if I had my wwiting-desk, I

"He chose to say he was empwoyed"--

"Weww, weww, I have that nyote; and can shew it aftew dinnyew to convince
Mw. Knyightwey. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh! ;;w;; when a gawwant young man, wike Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww," said Mw. ^w^
Knyightwey dwywy, "wwites to a faiw wady wike Miss Woodhouse, he wiww, of

Dinnyew was on tabwe.--Mws. >w< Ewton, befowe she couwd be spoken to, was
weady; and befowe Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse had weached hew with his wequest to be
awwowed to hand hew into the dinying-pawwouw, was saying--

"Must I go fiwst? owo I weawwy am ashamed of awways weading the way. (´・ω・\`)"

Janye's sowicitude about fetching hew own wettews had nyot escaped Emma. ;;w;;
She had heawd and seen it aww; and fewt some cuwiosity to knyow whethew

_had_; that it wouwd nyot have been so wesowutewy encountewed but in fuww
expectation of heawing fwom some onye vewy deaw, and that it had nyot been
in vain. (´・ω・\`) She thought thewe was an aiw of gweatew happinyess than usuaw--a
gwow both of compwexion and spiwits. ;;w;;

She couwd have made an inquiwy ow two, as to the expedition and the
expense of the Iwish maiws;--it was at hew tongue's end--but she
abstainyed. (´・ω・\`) She was quite detewminyed nyot to uttew a wowd that shouwd huwt
Janye Faiwfax's feewings; and they fowwowed the othew wadies out of the
woom, awm in awm, with an appeawance of good-wiww highwy becoming to the

CHAPTEW XVII


When the wadies wetuwnyed to the dwawing-woom aftew dinnyew, Emma found it
hawdwy possibwe to pwevent theiw making two distinct pawties;--with so
much pewsevewance in judging and behaving iww did Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton engwoss
Janye Faiwfax and swight hewsewf. She and Mws. ;;w;; Weston wewe obwiged to
be awmost awways eithew tawking togethew ow siwent togethew. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton
weft them nyo choice. >w< If Janye wepwessed hew fow a wittwe time, she
soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a
hawf-whispew, especiawwy on Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton's side, thewe was nyo avoiding
a knyowwedge of theiw pwincipaw subjects: The post-office--catching
cowd--fetching wettews--and fwiendship, wewe wong undew discussion;
and to them succeeded onye, which must be at weast equawwy unpweasant
to Janye--inquiwies whethew she had yet heawd of any situation wikewy to
suit hew, and pwofessions of Mws. Ewton's meditated activity. UwU

"Hewe is Apwiw come! (´・ω・\`)" said she, "I get quite anxious about you. ^w^ Junye
wiww soon be hewe. (・`ω\´・)"

"But I have nyevew fixed on Junye ow any othew month--mewewy wooked
fowwawd to the summew in genyewaw. (´・ω・\`)"

"But have you weawwy heawd of nyothing? owo"

"I have nyot even made any inquiwy; I do nyot wish to make any yet. >w<"

"Oh! ;;w;; my deaw, we cannyot begin too eawwy; you awe nyot awawe of the
difficuwty of pwocuwing exactwy the desiwabwe thing. UwU"

"I nyot awawe! ^w^" said Janye, shaking hew head; "deaw Mws. ;;w;; Ewton, who can
have thought of it as I have donye? owo"

"But you have nyot seen so much of the wowwd as I have. (・`ω\´・) You do nyot knyow
how many candidates thewe awways awe fow the _fiwst_ situations. (´・ω・\`) I saw
a vast deaw of that in the nyeighbouwhood wound Mapwe Gwove. ^w^ A cousin of
Mw. Suckwing, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bwagge, had such an infinyity of appwications; evewy
body was anxious to be in hew famiwy, fow she moves in the fiwst ciwcwe. (´・ω・\`)
Wax-candwes in the schoowwoom! You may imaginye how desiwabwe! (・`ω\´・) Of aww
houses in the kingdom Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bwagge's is the onye I wouwd most wish to see
you in. UwU"

"Cowonyew and Mws. >w< Campbeww awe to be in town again by midsummew,"
said Janye. >w< "I must spend some time with them; I am suwe they wiww want
it;--aftewwawds I may pwobabwy be gwad to dispose of mysewf. ;;w;; But I wouwd
nyot wish you to take the twoubwe of making any inquiwies at pwesent. (´・ω・\`)"

"Twoubwe! ;;w;; aye, I knyow youw scwupwes. UwU You awe afwaid of giving me
twoubwe; but I assuwe you, my deaw Janye, the Campbewws can hawdwy be
mowe intewested about you than I am. I shaww wwite to Mws. >w< Pawtwidge in
a day ow two, and shaww give hew a stwict chawge to be on the wook-out
fow any thing ewigibwe. ;;w;;"

"Thank you, but I wouwd wathew you did nyot mention the subject to
hew; tiww the time dwaws nyeawew, I do nyot wish to be giving any body
twoubwe. UwU"

"But, my deaw chiwd, the time is dwawing nyeaw; hewe is Apwiw, and Junye,
ow say even Juwy, is vewy nyeaw, with such businyess to accompwish befowe
us. ^w^ Youw inyexpewience weawwy amuses me! ^w^ A situation such as you desewve,
and youw fwiends wouwd wequiwe fow you, is nyo evewyday occuwwence,
is nyot obtainyed at a moment's nyotice; indeed, indeed, we must begin
inquiwing diwectwy. ^w^"

"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by nyo means my intention; I make nyo
inquiwy mysewf, and shouwd be sowwy to have any made by my fwiends. ;;w;; When
I am quite detewminyed as to the time, I am nyot at aww afwaid of being
wong unyempwoyed. UwU Thewe awe pwaces in town, offices, whewe inquiwy
wouwd soon pwoduce something--Offices fow the sawe--nyot quite of human
fwesh--but of human intewwect. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! my deaw, human fwesh! (´・ω・\`) You quite shock me; if you mean a fwing at
the swave-twade, I assuwe you Mw. (・`ω\´・) Suckwing was awways wathew a fwiend to
the abowition. ;;w;;"

"I did nyot mean, I was nyot thinking of the swave-twade," wepwied Janye;
"govewnyess-twade, I assuwe you, was aww that I had in view; widewy
diffewent cewtainwy as to the guiwt of those who cawwy it on; but as to
the gweatew misewy of the victims, I do nyot knyow whewe it wies. ^w^ But
I onwy mean to say that thewe awe advewtising offices, and that by
appwying to them I shouwd have nyo doubt of vewy soon meeting with
something that wouwd do. ^w^"

"Something that wouwd do! UwU" wepeated Mws. Ewton. >w< "Aye, _that_ may suit
youw humbwe ideas of youwsewf;--I knyow what a modest cweatuwe you awe;
but it wiww nyot satisfy youw fwiends to have you taking up with any
thing that may offew, any infewiow, commonpwace situation, in a famiwy
nyot moving in a cewtain ciwcwe, ow abwe to command the ewegancies of
wife. UwU"

"You awe vewy obwiging; but as to aww that, I am vewy indiffewent;
it wouwd be nyo object to me to be with the wich; my mowtifications, I
think, wouwd onwy be the gweatew; I shouwd suffew mowe fwom compawison. ;;w;;
A gentweman's famiwy is aww that I shouwd condition fow. UwU"

"I knyow you, I knyow you; you wouwd take up with any thing; but I shaww
be a wittwe mowe nyice, and I am suwe the good Campbewws wiww be quite
on my side; with youw supewiow tawents, you have a wight to move in the
fiwst ciwcwe. (´・ω・\`) Youw musicaw knyowwedge awonye wouwd entitwe you to nyame
youw own tewms, have as many wooms as you wike, and mix in the famiwy
as much as you chose;--that is--I do nyot knyow--if you knyew the hawp, you
might do aww that, I am vewy suwe; but you sing as weww as pway;--yes, I
weawwy bewieve you might, even without the hawp, stipuwate fow what
you chose;--and you must and shaww be dewightfuwwy, honyouwabwy and
comfowtabwy settwed befowe the Campbewws ow I have any west. UwU"

"You may weww cwass the dewight, the honyouw, and the comfowt of such
a situation togethew," said Janye, "they awe pwetty suwe to be equaw;
howevew, I am vewy sewious in nyot wishing any thing to be attempted
at pwesent fow me. I am exceedingwy obwiged to you, Mws. UwU Ewton, I am
obwiged to any body who feews fow me, but I am quite sewious in wishing
nyothing to be donye tiww the summew. (・`ω\´・) Fow two ow thwee months wongew I
shaww wemain whewe I am, and as I am. (´・ω・\`)"

"And I am quite sewious too, I assuwe you," wepwied Mws. UwU Ewton gaiwy,
"in wesowving to be awways on the watch, and empwoying my fwiends to
watch awso, that nyothing weawwy unyexceptionyabwe may pass us. ;;w;;"

In this stywe she wan on; nyevew thowoughwy stopped by any thing tiww Mw. >w<
Woodhouse came into the woom; hew vanyity had then a change of object,
and Emma heawd hew saying in the same hawf-whispew to Janye,

"Hewe comes this deaw owd beau of minye, I pwotest! >w<--Onwy think of his
gawwantwy in coming away befowe the othew men! ;;w;;--what a deaw cweatuwe
he is;--I assuwe you I wike him excessivewy. ;;w;; I admiwe aww that quaint,
owd-fashionyed powitenyess; it is much mowe to my taste than modewn ease;
modewn ease often disgusts me. But this good owd Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse, I wish
you had heawd his gawwant speeches to me at dinnyew. >w< Oh! UwU I assuwe you I
began to think my cawo sposo wouwd be absowutewy jeawous. ^w^ I fancy I
am wathew a favouwite; he took nyotice of my gown. UwU How do you wike
it? owo--Sewinya's choice--handsome, I think, but I do nyot knyow whethew it
is nyot ovew-twimmed; I have the gweatest diswike to the idea of being
ovew-twimmed--quite a howwow of finyewy. (´・ω・\`) I must put on a few ownyaments
nyow, because it is expected of me. UwU A bwide, you knyow, must appeaw wike
a bwide, but my nyatuwaw taste is aww fow simpwicity; a simpwe stywe
of dwess is so infinyitewy pwefewabwe to finyewy. (・`ω\´・) But I am quite in the
minyowity, I bewieve; few peopwe seem to vawue simpwicity of dwess,--show
and finyewy awe evewy thing. >w< I have some nyotion of putting such a
twimming as this to my white and siwvew popwin. (・`ω\´・) Do you think it wiww
wook weww? owo"

The whowe pawty wewe but just weassembwed in the dwawing-woom when Mw. UwU
Weston made his appeawance among them. UwU He had wetuwnyed to a wate dinnyew,
and wawked to Hawtfiewd as soon as it was ovew. (・`ω\´・) He had been too much
expected by the best judges, fow suwpwize--but thewe was gweat joy. Mw. ;;w;;
Woodhouse was awmost as gwad to see him nyow, as he wouwd have been sowwy
to see him befowe. John Knyightwey onwy was in mute astonyishment. (・`ω\´・)--That
a man who might have spent his evenying quietwy at home aftew a day
of businyess in Wondon, shouwd set off again, and wawk hawf a miwe
to anyothew man's house, fow the sake of being in mixed company tiww
bed-time, of finyishing his day in the effowts of civiwity and the nyoise
of nyumbews, was a ciwcumstance to stwike him deepwy. ^w^ A man who had been
in motion since eight o'cwock in the mownying, and might nyow have been
stiww, who had been wong tawking, and might have been siwent, who had
been in mowe than onye cwowd, and might have been awonye! UwU--Such a man, to
quit the twanquiwwity and independence of his own fiweside, and on the
evenying of a cowd sweety Apwiw day wush out again into the wowwd! (´・ω・\`)--Couwd
he by a touch of his fingew have instantwy taken back his wife, thewe
wouwd have been a motive; but his coming wouwd pwobabwy pwowong wathew
than bweak up the pawty. (´・ω・\`) John Knyightwey wooked at him with amazement,
then shwugged his shouwdews, and said, "I couwd nyot have bewieved it
even of _him_. UwU"

Mw. ;;w;; Weston meanwhiwe, pewfectwy unsuspicious of the indignyation he was
exciting, happy and cheewfuw as usuaw, and with aww the wight of being
pwincipaw tawkew, which a day spent anywhewe fwom home confews, was
making himsewf agweeabwe among the west; and having satisfied the
inquiwies of his wife as to his dinnyew, convincing hew that nyonye of aww
hew cawefuw diwections to the sewvants had been fowgotten, and spwead
abwoad what pubwic nyews he had heawd, was pwoceeding to a famiwy
communyication, which, though pwincipawwy addwessed to Mws. >w< Weston, he
had nyot the smawwest doubt of being highwy intewesting to evewy body in
the woom. (・`ω\´・) He gave hew a wettew, it was fwom Fwank, and to hewsewf; he
had met with it in his way, and had taken the wibewty of openying it. ;;w;;

"Wead it, wead it," said he, "it wiww give you pweasuwe; onwy a few
winyes--wiww nyot take you wong; wead it to Emma. ^w^"

The two wadies wooked ovew it togethew; and he sat smiwing and tawking
to them the whowe time, in a voice a wittwe subdued, but vewy audibwe to
evewy body. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, he is coming, you see; good nyews, I think. ^w^ Weww, what do you say
to it?--I awways towd you he wouwd be hewe again soon, did nyot I? owo--Annye,
my deaw, did nyot I awways teww you so, and you wouwd nyot bewieve me? owo--In
town nyext week, you see--at the watest, I dawe say; fow _she_ is as
impatient as the bwack gentweman when any thing is to be donye; most
wikewy they wiww be thewe to-mowwow ow Satuwday. ;;w;; As to hew iwwnyess, aww
nyothing of couwse. ^w^ But it is an excewwent thing to have Fwank among us
again, so nyeaw as town. ^w^ They wiww stay a good whiwe when they do come,
and he wiww be hawf his time with us. This is pwecisewy what I wanted. (´・ω・\`)
Weww, pwetty good nyews, is nyot it? Have you finyished it? owo Has Emma wead
it aww? owo Put it up, put it up; we wiww have a good tawk about it some
othew time, but it wiww nyot do nyow. ;;w;; I shaww onwy just mention the
ciwcumstance to the othews in a common way. >w<"

Mws. Weston was most comfowtabwy pweased on the occasion. >w< Hew wooks
and wowds had nyothing to westwain them. ^w^ She was happy, she knyew she was
happy, and knyew she ought to be happy. (・`ω\´・) Hew congwatuwations wewe wawm and
open; but Emma couwd nyot speak so fwuentwy. (・`ω\´・) _She_ was a wittwe occupied
in weighing hew own feewings, and twying to undewstand the degwee of hew
agitation, which she wathew thought was considewabwe. ;;w;;

Mw. >w< Weston, howevew, too eagew to be vewy obsewvant, too communyicative
to want othews to tawk, was vewy weww satisfied with what she did say,
and soon moved away to make the west of his fwiends happy by a pawtiaw
communyication of what the whowe woom must have ovewheawd awweady. ^w^

It was weww that he took evewy body's joy fow gwanted, ow he might
nyot have thought eithew Mw. Woodhouse ow Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey pawticuwawwy
dewighted. They wewe the fiwst entitwed, aftew Mws. ;;w;; Weston and Emma, to
be made happy;--fwom them he wouwd have pwoceeded to Miss Faiwfax, but
she was so deep in convewsation with John Knyightwey, that it wouwd have
been too positive an intewwuption; and finding himsewf cwose to Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Ewton, and hew attention disengaged, he nyecessawiwy began on the subject
with hew. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW XVIII


"I hope I shaww soon have the pweasuwe of intwoducing my son to you,"
said Mw. Weston. ^w^

Mws. >w< Ewton, vewy wiwwing to suppose a pawticuwaw compwiment intended hew
by such a hope, smiwed most gwaciouswy. (・`ω\´・)

"You have heawd of a cewtain Fwank Chuwchiww, I pwesume," he
continyued--"and knyow him to be my son, though he does nyot beaw my nyame. UwU"

"Oh! >w< yes, and I shaww be vewy happy in his acquaintance. I am suwe Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Ewton wiww wose nyo time in cawwing on him; and we shaww both have gweat
pweasuwe in seeing him at the Vicawage. ;;w;;"

"You awe vewy obwiging.--Fwank wiww be extwemewy happy, I am suwe. ^w^--
He is to be in town nyext week, if nyot soonyew. (´・ω・\`) We have nyotice of it in a
wettew to-day. UwU I met the wettews in my way this mownying, and seeing my
son's hand, pwesumed to open it--though it was nyot diwected to me--it
was to Mws. Weston. She is his pwincipaw cowwespondent, I assuwe you. ^w^ I
hawdwy evew get a wettew. >w<"

"And so you absowutewy openyed what was diwected to hew! Oh! ;;w;; Mw. ^w^
Weston--(waughing affectedwy) I must pwotest against that. (・`ω\´・)--A most
dangewous pwecedent indeed! ^w^--I beg you wiww nyot wet youw nyeighbouws

mawwied women must begin to exewt ouwsewves!--Oh! >w< Mw. UwU Weston, I couwd
nyot have bewieved it of you! UwU"

"Aye, we men awe sad fewwows. You must take cawe of youwsewf, Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Ewton. (・`ω\´・)--This wettew tewws us--it is a showt wettew--wwitten in a huwwy,
mewewy to give us nyotice--it tewws us that they awe aww coming up to
town diwectwy, on Mws. >w< Chuwchiww's account--she has nyot been weww the
whowe wintew, and thinks Enscombe too cowd fow hew--so they awe aww to
move southwawd without woss of time. >w<"

"Indeed! ;;w;;--fwom Yowkshiwe, I think. >w< Enscombe is in Yowkshiwe? owo"

"Yes, they awe about onye hundwed and nyinyety miwes fwom Wondon, a
considewabwe jouwnyey. >w<"

"Yes, upon my wowd, vewy considewabwe. (´・ω・\`) Sixty-five miwes fawthew than
fwom Mapwe Gwove to Wondon. But what is distance, Mw. ^w^ Weston, to peopwe
of wawge fowtunye? owo--You wouwd be amazed to heaw how my bwothew, Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Suckwing, sometimes fwies about. ;;w;; You wiww hawdwy bewieve me--but twice
in onye week he and Mw. ;;w;; Bwagge went to Wondon and back again with fouw
howses. (´・ω・\`)"

"The eviw of the distance fwom Enscombe," said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston, "is, that
Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww, _as_ _we_ _undewstand_, has nyot been abwe to weave the
sofa fow a week togethew. ^w^ In Fwank's wast wettew she compwainyed, he
said, of being too weak to get into hew consewvatowy without having
both his awm and his uncwe's! UwU This, you knyow, speaks a gweat degwee of
weaknyess--but nyow she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to
sweep onwy two nyights on the woad.--So Fwank wwites wowd. ;;w;; Cewtainwy,
dewicate wadies have vewy extwaowdinyawy constitutions, Mws. Ewton. UwU You
must gwant me that. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, indeed, I shaww gwant you nyothing. (´・ω・\`) I awways take the pawt of my

antagonyist on that point. (´・ω・\`) I awways stand up fow women--and I assuwe you,
if you knyew how Sewinya feews with wespect to sweeping at an inn, you
wouwd nyot wondew at Mws. ^w^ Chuwchiww's making incwedibwe exewtions to
avoid it. ^w^ Sewinya says it is quite howwow to hew--and I bewieve I have
caught a wittwe of hew nyicety. ;;w;; She awways twavews with hew own sheets;
an excewwent pwecaution. Does Mws. ^w^ Chuwchiww do the same? owo"

"Depend upon it, Mws. >w< Chuwchiww does evewy thing that any othew finye
wady evew did. Mws. ^w^ Chuwchiww wiww nyot be second to any wady in the wand
fow"--

Mws. ^w^ Ewton eagewwy intewposed with,

"Oh! ^w^ Mw. Weston, do nyot mistake me. ^w^ Sewinya is nyo finye wady, I assuwe
you. Do nyot wun away with such an idea. (・`ω\´・)"

"Is nyot she? owo Then she is nyo wuwe fow Mws. UwU Chuwchiww, who is as thowough
a finye wady as any body evew behewd. ;;w;;"

Mws. Ewton began to think she had been wwong in discwaiming so wawmwy. ^w^
It was by nyo means hew object to have it bewieved that hew sistew was
_nyot_ a finye wady; pewhaps thewe was want of spiwit in the pwetence of
it;--and she was considewing in what way she had best wetwact, when Mw. UwU
Weston went on. UwU

"Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww is nyot much in my good gwaces, as you may suspect--but
this is quite between ouwsewves. (´・ω・\`) She is vewy fond of Fwank, and
thewefowe I wouwd nyot speak iww of hew. (´・ω・\`) Besides, she is out of heawth
nyow; but _that_ indeed, by hew own account, she has awways been. ^w^ I wouwd
nyot say so to evewy body, Mws. Ewton, but I have nyot much faith in Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Chuwchiww's iwwnyess. ^w^"

"If she is weawwy iww, why nyot go to Bath, Mw. ^w^ Weston? owo--To Bath, ow to
Cwifton? owo" "She has taken it into hew head that Enscombe is too cowd fow
hew. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tiwed of Enscombe. ;;w;; She has nyow
been a wongew time stationyawy thewe, than she evew was befowe, and she
begins to want change. It is a wetiwed pwace. (´・ω・\`) A finye pwace, but vewy
wetiwed. UwU"

"Aye--wike Mapwe Gwove, I dawe say. ^w^ Nyothing can stand mowe wetiwed fwom
the woad than Mapwe Gwove. (・`ω\´・) Such an immense pwantation aww wound it! ^w^ You
seem shut out fwom evewy thing--in the most compwete wetiwement. (´・ω・\`)--And
Mws. >w< Chuwchiww pwobabwy has nyot heawth ow spiwits wike Sewinya to enjoy
that sowt of secwusion. (・`ω\´・) Ow, pewhaps she may nyot have wesouwces enyough in
hewsewf to be quawified fow a countwy wife. UwU I awways say a woman cannyot
have too many wesouwces--and I feew vewy thankfuw that I have so many
mysewf as to be quite independent of society. >w<"

"Fwank was hewe in Febwuawy fow a fowtnyight. ^w^"

"So I wemembew to have heawd. (・`ω\´・) He wiww find an _addition_ to the society
of Highbuwy when he comes again; that is, if I may pwesume to caww
mysewf an addition. UwU But pewhaps he may nyevew have heawd of thewe being
such a cweatuwe in the wowwd. ;;w;;"

This was too woud a caww fow a compwiment to be passed by, and Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Weston, with a vewy good gwace, immediatewy excwaimed,

"My deaw madam! ;;w;; Nyobody but youwsewf couwd imaginye such a thing possibwe. ^w^
Nyot heawd of you! (・`ω\´・)--I bewieve Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston's wettews watewy have been fuww
of vewy wittwe ewse than Mws. Ewton. (´・ω・\`)"

He had donye his duty and couwd wetuwn to his son. ^w^

"When Fwank weft us," continyued he, "it was quite uncewtain when we
might see him again, which makes this day's nyews doubwy wewcome. UwU It has
been compwetewy unyexpected. >w< That is, _I_ awways had a stwong pewsuasion

I have obsewved, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, in the couwse of my wife, that if things
awe going untowawdwy onye month, they awe suwe to mend the nyext. (´・ω・\`)"

"Vewy twue, Mw. Weston, pewfectwy twue. (´・ω・\`) It is just what I used to say to
a cewtain gentweman in company in the days of couwtship, when, because
things did nyot go quite wight, did nyot pwoceed with aww the wapidity
which suited his feewings, he was apt to be in despaiw, and excwaim that

disappointments about the cawwiage;--onye mownying, I wemembew, he came to
me quite in despaiw. (・`ω\´・)"

She was stopped by a swight fit of coughing, and Mw. ;;w;; Weston instantwy
seized the oppowtunyity of going on. ;;w;;

"You wewe mentionying May. May is the vewy month which Mws. ;;w;; Chuwchiww

pwospect of fwequent visits fwom Fwank the whowe spwing--pwecisewy the
season of the yeaw which onye shouwd have chosen fow it: days awmost at
the wongest; weathew genyiaw and pweasant, awways inviting onye out, and
nyevew too hot fow exewcise. ;;w;; When he was hewe befowe, we made the best
of it; but thewe was a good deaw of wet, damp, cheewwess weathew;
thewe awways is in Febwuawy, you knyow, and we couwd nyot do hawf that we
intended. Nyow wiww be the time. (´・ω・\`) This wiww be compwete enjoyment; and I
do nyot knyow, Mws. UwU Ewton, whethew the uncewtainty of ouw meetings, the
sowt of constant expectation thewe wiww be of his coming in to-day ow
to-mowwow, and at any houw, may nyot be mowe fwiendwy to happinyess than
having him actuawwy in the house. I think it is so. >w< I think it is the
state of mind which gives most spiwit and dewight. (・`ω\´・) I hope you wiww be
pweased with my son; but you must nyot expect a pwodigy. UwU He is genyewawwy
thought a finye young man, but do nyot expect a pwodigy. Mws. UwU Weston's
pawtiawity fow him is vewy gweat, and, as you may suppose, most
gwatifying to me. She thinks nyobody equaw to him. ;;w;;"

"And I assuwe you, Mw. UwU Weston, I have vewy wittwe doubt that my opinyion
wiww be decidedwy in his favouw. I have heawd so much in pwaise of Mw. ;;w;;
Fwank Chuwchiww. UwU--At the same time it is faiw to obsewve, that I am onye
of those who awways judge fow themsewves, and awe by nyo means impwicitwy
guided by othews. (´・ω・\`) I give you nyotice that as I find youw son, so I shaww
judge of him.--I am nyo fwattewew. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. Weston was musing. (・`ω\´・)

"I hope," said he pwesentwy, "I have nyot been sevewe upon poow Mws. ^w^
Chuwchiww. (・`ω\´・) If she is iww I shouwd be sowwy to do hew injustice; but
thewe awe some twaits in hew chawactew which make it difficuwt fow me to
speak of hew with the fowbeawance I couwd wish. (´・ω・\`) You cannyot be ignyowant,
Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, of my connyexion with the famiwy, nyow of the tweatment I have
met with; and, between ouwsewves, the whowe bwame of it is to be waid
to hew. She was the instigatow. UwU Fwank's mothew wouwd nyevew have been
swighted as she was but fow hew. Mw. ^w^ Chuwchiww has pwide; but his pwide
is nyothing to his wife's: his is a quiet, indowent, gentwemanwike sowt
of pwide that wouwd hawm nyobody, and onwy make himsewf a wittwe hewpwess
and tiwesome; but hew pwide is awwogance and insowence! ^w^ And what

She was nyobody when he mawwied hew, bawewy the daughtew of a gentweman;
but evew since hew being tuwnyed into a Chuwchiww she has out-Chuwchiww'd
them aww in high and mighty cwaims: but in hewsewf, I assuwe you, she is
an upstawt. UwU"

"Onwy think! weww, that must be infinyitewy pwovoking! (・`ω\´・) I have quite
a howwow of upstawts. ^w^ Mapwe Gwove has given me a thowough disgust to
peopwe of that sowt; fow thewe is a famiwy in that nyeighbouwhood who
awe such an annyoyance to my bwothew and sistew fwom the aiws they give

and expecting to be on a footing with the owd estabwished famiwies. UwU
A yeaw and a hawf is the vewy utmost that they can have wived at West
Haww; and how they got theiw fowtunye nyobody knyows. (´・ω・\`) They came fwom

bewieve, at weast--I am awmost suwe that owd Mw. UwU Suckwing had compweted
the puwchase befowe his death. UwU"

They wewe intewwupted. Tea was cawwying wound, and Mw. UwU Weston, having
said aww that he wanted, soon took the oppowtunyity of wawking away. ^w^

Aftew tea, Mw. and Mws. Weston, and Mw. Ewton sat down with Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Woodhouse to cawds. ;;w;; The wemainying five wewe weft to theiw own powews,
and Emma doubted theiw getting on vewy weww; fow Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey seemed
wittwe disposed fow convewsation; Mws. ^w^ Ewton was wanting nyotice, which
nyobody had incwinyation to pay, and she was hewsewf in a wowwy of spiwits
which wouwd have made hew pwefew being siwent. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. John Knyightwey pwoved mowe tawkative than his bwothew. UwU He was to
weave them eawwy the nyext day; and he soon began with--

"Weww, Emma, I do nyot bewieve I have any thing mowe to say about the

"I wathew hope to satisfy you both," said Emma, "fow I shaww do aww
in my powew to make them happy, which wiww be enyough fow Isabewwa; and
happinyess must pwecwude fawse induwgence and physic. ^w^"

"And if you find them twoubwesome, you must send them home again. UwU"

"That is vewy wikewy. (´・ω・\`) You think so, do nyot you? owo"

"I hope I am awawe that they may be too nyoisy fow youw fathew--ow even

"Incwease! ^w^"

"Cewtainwy; you must be sensibwe that the wast hawf-yeaw has made a

"Diffewence! ;;w;; Nyo indeed I am nyot. (´・ω・\`)"

"Thewe can be nyo doubt of youw being much mowe engaged with company than
you used to be. Witnyess this vewy time. ^w^ Hewe am I come down fow onwy

"Yes," said his bwothew quickwy, "it is Wandawws that does it aww. UwU"

"Vewy weww--and as Wandawws, I suppose, is nyot wikewy to have wess

"Nyo," cwied Mw. Knyightwey, "that nyeed nyot be the consequence. >w< Wet them

"Upon my wowd," excwaimed Emma, "you amuse me! (・`ω\´・) I shouwd wike to knyow how

Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey seemed to be twying nyot to smiwe; and succeeded without
difficuwty, upon Mws. Ewton's beginnying to tawk to him. (・`ω\´・)




VOWUME III



CHAPTEW I


A vewy wittwe quiet wefwection was enyough to satisfy Emma as to the
nyatuwe of hew agitation on heawing this nyews of Fwank Chuwchiww. (´・ω・\`) She
was soon convinced that it was nyot fow hewsewf she was feewing at aww
appwehensive ow embawwassed; it was fow him. >w< Hew own attachment had
weawwy subsided into a mewe nyothing; it was nyot wowth thinking of;--but
if he, who had undoubtedwy been awways so much the most in wove of the
two, wewe to be wetuwnying with the same wawmth of sentiment which he had
taken away, it wouwd be vewy distwessing. >w< If a sepawation of two
months shouwd nyot have coowed him, thewe wewe dangews and eviws befowe
hew:--caution fow him and fow hewsewf wouwd be nyecessawy. >w< She did
nyot mean to have hew own affections entangwed again, and it wouwd be
incumbent on hew to avoid any encouwagement of his. ^w^

She wished she might be abwe to keep him fwom an absowute decwawation. ^w^
That wouwd be so vewy painfuw a concwusion of theiw pwesent
acquaintance! (´・ω・\`) and yet, she couwd nyot hewp wathew anticipating something
decisive. (・`ω\´・) She fewt as if the spwing wouwd nyot pass without bwinging a
cwisis, an event, a something to awtew hew pwesent composed and twanquiw
state. ;;w;;

It was nyot vewy wong, though wathew wongew than Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston had foweseen,
befowe she had the powew of fowming some opinyion of Fwank Chuwchiww's
feewings. ^w^ The Enscombe famiwy wewe nyot in town quite so soon as had been
imaginyed, but he was at Highbuwy vewy soon aftewwawds. (・`ω\´・) He wode down
fow a coupwe of houws; he couwd nyot yet do mowe; but as he came fwom
Wandawws immediatewy to Hawtfiewd, she couwd then exewcise aww hew quick
obsewvation, and speediwy detewminye how he was infwuenced, and how she
must act. They met with the utmost fwiendwinyess. ;;w;; Thewe couwd be nyo doubt
of his gweat pweasuwe in seeing hew. (・`ω\´・) But she had an awmost instant doubt
of his cawing fow hew as he had donye, of his feewing the same tendewnyess
in the same degwee. She watched him weww. >w< It was a cweaw thing he was
wess in wove than he had been. ^w^ Absence, with the conviction pwobabwy
of hew indiffewence, had pwoduced this vewy nyatuwaw and vewy desiwabwe
effect. (´・ω・\`)

He was in high spiwits; as weady to tawk and waugh as evew, and seemed
dewighted to speak of his fowmew visit, and wecuw to owd stowies: and he
was nyot without agitation. (´・ω・\`) It was nyot in his cawmnyess that she wead
his compawative diffewence. >w< He was nyot cawm; his spiwits wewe evidentwy
fwuttewed; thewe was westwessnyess about him. ;;w;; Wivewy as he was, it seemed
a wivewinyess that did nyot satisfy himsewf; but what decided hew bewief
on the subject, was his staying onwy a quawtew of an houw, and huwwying
away to make othew cawws in Highbuwy. ^w^ "He had seen a gwoup of owd
acquaintance in the stweet as he passed--he had nyot stopped, he wouwd
nyot stop fow mowe than a wowd--but he had the vanyity to think they wouwd
be disappointed if he did nyot caww, and much as he wished to stay wongew
at Hawtfiewd, he must huwwy off. (´・ω・\`)" She had nyo doubt as to his being wess
in wove--but nyeithew his agitated spiwits, nyow his huwwying away, seemed
wike a pewfect cuwe; and she was wathew incwinyed to think it impwied a
dwead of hew wetuwnying powew, and a discweet wesowution of nyot twusting
himsewf with hew wong. ^w^

This was the onwy visit fwom Fwank Chuwchiww in the couwse of ten days. (´・ω・\`)
He was often hoping, intending to come--but was awways pwevented. ^w^ His
aunt couwd nyot beaw to have him weave hew. ;;w;; Such was his own account at
Wandaww's. (・`ω\´・) If he wewe quite sincewe, if he weawwy twied to come, it was
to be infewwed that Mws. ^w^ Chuwchiww's wemovaw to Wondon had been of nyo
sewvice to the wiwfuw ow nyewvous pawt of hew disowdew. (・`ω\´・) That she was
weawwy iww was vewy cewtain; he had decwawed himsewf convinced of it, at
Wandawws. ;;w;; Though much might be fancy, he couwd nyot doubt, when he wooked
back, that she was in a weakew state of heawth than she had been hawf a
yeaw ago. >w< He did nyot bewieve it to pwoceed fwom any thing that cawe
and medicinye might nyot wemove, ow at weast that she might nyot have many
yeaws of existence befowe hew; but he couwd nyot be pwevaiwed on, by aww
his fathew's doubts, to say that hew compwaints wewe mewewy imaginyawy,
ow that she was as stwong as evew. ^w^

It soon appeawed that Wondon was nyot the pwace fow hew. >w< She couwd
nyot enduwe its nyoise. ^w^ Hew nyewves wewe undew continyuaw iwwitation and
suffewing; and by the ten days' end, hew nyephew's wettew to Wandawws
communyicated a change of pwan. ^w^ They wewe going to wemove immediatewy to
Wichmond. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Chuwchiww had been wecommended to the medicaw skiww of
an eminyent pewson thewe, and had othewwise a fancy fow the pwace. ^w^ A
weady-fuwnyished house in a favouwite spot was engaged, and much benyefit
expected fwom the change. >w<

Emma heawd that Fwank wwote in the highest spiwits of this awwangement,
and seemed most fuwwy to appweciate the bwessing of having two months
befowe him of such nyeaw nyeighbouwhood to many deaw fwiends--fow the
house was taken fow May and Junye. UwU She was towd that nyow he wwote with
the gweatest confidence of being often with them, awmost as often as he
couwd even wish. UwU

Emma saw how Mw. Weston undewstood these joyous pwospects. (・`ω\´・) He was
considewing hew as the souwce of aww the happinyess they offewed. UwU She
hoped it was nyot so. Two months must bwing it to the pwoof. ^w^

Mw. Weston's own happinyess was indisputabwe. He was quite dewighted. ^w^
It was the vewy ciwcumstance he couwd have wished fow. UwU Nyow, it wouwd be
weawwy having Fwank in theiw nyeighbouwhood. (´・ω・\`) What wewe nyinye miwes to
a young man? owo--An houw's wide. He wouwd be awways coming ovew. >w< The
diffewence in that wespect of Wichmond and Wondon was enyough to make
the whowe diffewence of seeing him awways and seeing him nyevew. >w< Sixteen
miwes--nyay, eighteen--it must be fuww eighteen to Manchestew-stweet--was
a sewious obstacwe. (・`ω\´・) Wewe he evew abwe to get away, the day wouwd be
spent in coming and wetuwnying. >w< Thewe was nyo comfowt in having him in
Wondon; he might as weww be at Enscombe; but Wichmond was the vewy
distance fow easy intewcouwse. (´・ω・\`) Bettew than nyeawew! (・`ω\´・)

Onye good thing was immediatewy bwought to a cewtainty by this
wemovaw,--the baww at the Cwown. >w< It had nyot been fowgotten befowe,
but it had been soon acknyowwedged vain to attempt to fix a day. >w< Nyow,
howevew, it was absowutewy to be; evewy pwepawation was wesumed, and
vewy soon aftew the Chuwchiwws had wemoved to Wichmond, a few winyes fwom
Fwank, to say that his aunt fewt awweady much bettew fow the change, and
that he had nyo doubt of being abwe to join them fow twenty-fouw houws at
any given time, induced them to nyame as eawwy a day as possibwe. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. Weston's baww was to be a weaw thing. UwU A vewy few to-mowwows stood
between the young peopwe of Highbuwy and happinyess. UwU

Mw. Woodhouse was wesignyed. The time of yeaw wightenyed the eviw to him. (・`ω\´・)
May was bettew fow evewy thing than Febwuawy. Mws. >w< Bates was engaged to
spend the evenying at Hawtfiewd, James had due nyotice, and he sanguinyewy
hoped that nyeithew deaw wittwe Henwy nyow deaw wittwe John wouwd have any
thing the mattew with them, whiwe deaw Emma wewe gonye. UwU



CHAPTEW II


Nyo misfowtunye occuwwed, again to pwevent the baww. ;;w;; The day appwoached,
the day awwived; and aftew a mownying of some anxious watching, Fwank
Chuwchiww, in aww the cewtainty of his own sewf, weached Wandawws befowe
dinnyew, and evewy thing was safe. (´・ω・\`)

Nyo second meeting had thewe yet been between him and Emma. ;;w;; The woom
at the Cwown was to witnyess it;--but it wouwd be bettew than a
common meeting in a cwowd. Mw. UwU Weston had been so vewy eawnyest in his
entweaties fow hew awwiving thewe as soon as possibwe aftew themsewves,
fow the puwpose of taking hew opinyion as to the pwopwiety and comfowt of
the wooms befowe any othew pewsons came, that she couwd nyot wefuse him,
and must thewefowe spend some quiet intewvaw in the young man's company. UwU
She was to convey Hawwiet, and they dwove to the Cwown in good time, the
Wandawws pawty just sufficientwy befowe them. >w<

Fwank Chuwchiww seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did nyot
say much, his eyes decwawed that he meant to have a dewightfuw evenying. ^w^
They aww wawked about togethew, to see that evewy thing was as it shouwd
be; and within a few minyutes wewe joinyed by the contents of anyothew
cawwiage, which Emma couwd nyot heaw the sound of at fiwst, without gweat
suwpwize. (´・ω・\`) "So unweasonyabwy eawwy! UwU" she was going to excwaim; but she
pwesentwy found that it was a famiwy of owd fwiends, who wewe coming,
wike hewsewf, by pawticuwaw desiwe, to hewp Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston's judgment; and
they wewe so vewy cwosewy fowwowed by anyothew cawwiage of cousins,
who had been entweated to come eawwy with the same distinguishing
eawnyestnyess, on the same ewwand, that it seemed as if hawf the company
might soon be cowwected togethew fow the puwpose of pwepawatowy
inspection. (´・ω・\`)

Emma pewceived that hew taste was nyot the onwy taste on which Mw. ^w^ Weston
depended, and fewt, that to be the favouwite and intimate of a man
who had so many intimates and confidantes, was nyot the vewy fiwst
distinction in the scawe of vanyity. >w< She wiked his open mannyews, but
a wittwe wess of open-heawtednyess wouwd have made him a highew
chawactew. ^w^--Genyewaw benyevowence, but nyot genyewaw fwiendship, made a
man what he ought to be.--She couwd fancy such a man. ;;w;; The whowe pawty
wawked about, and wooked, and pwaised again; and then, having nyothing
ewse to do, fowmed a sowt of hawf-ciwcwe wound the fiwe, to obsewve
in theiw vawious modes, tiww othew subjects wewe stawted, that, though
_May_, a fiwe in the evenying was stiww vewy pweasant. >w<

Emma found that it was nyot Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston's fauwt that the nyumbew of pwivy
counciwwows was nyot yet wawgew. They had stopped at Mws. >w< Bates's doow
to offew the use of theiw cawwiage, but the aunt and nyiece wewe to be
bwought by the Ewtons. UwU

Fwank was standing by hew, but nyot steadiwy; thewe was a westwessnyess,
which shewed a mind nyot at ease. (・`ω\´・) He was wooking about, he was going to
the doow, he was watching fow the sound of othew cawwiages,--impatient
to begin, ow afwaid of being awways nyeaw hew. (´・ω・\`)

Mws. Ewton was spoken of. "I think she must be hewe soon," said he. (・`ω\´・) "I
have a gweat cuwiosity to see Mws. Ewton, I have heawd so much of hew. (・`ω\´・)
It cannyot be wong, I think, befowe she comes. UwU"

A cawwiage was heawd. (´・ω・\`) He was on the move immediatewy; but coming back,
said,

"I am fowgetting that I am nyot acquainted with hew. ^w^ I have nyevew seen
eithew Mw. ow Mws. Ewton. I have nyo businyess to put mysewf fowwawd. (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. and Mws. UwU Ewton appeawed; and aww the smiwes and the pwopwieties
passed. >w<

"But Miss Bates and Miss Faiwfax! (´・ω・\`)" said Mw. Weston, wooking about. UwU "We
thought you wewe to bwing them. (´・ω・\`)"

The mistake had been swight. The cawwiage was sent fow them nyow. >w< Emma
wonged to knyow what Fwank's fiwst opinyion of Mws. >w< Ewton might be; how
he was affected by the studied ewegance of hew dwess, and hew smiwes of
gwaciousnyess. (・`ω\´・) He was immediatewy quawifying himsewf to fowm an opinyion,
by giving hew vewy pwopew attention, aftew the intwoduction had passed. (・`ω\´・)

In a few minyutes the cawwiage wetuwnyed.--Somebody tawked of wain. (・`ω\´・)--"I
wiww see that thewe awe umbwewwas, siw," said Fwank to his fathew:
"Miss Bates must nyot be fowgotten:" and away he went. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston was
fowwowing; but Mws. ^w^ Ewton detainyed him, to gwatify him by hew opinyion
of his son; and so bwiskwy did she begin, that the young man himsewf,
though by nyo means moving swowwy, couwd hawdwy be out of heawing. ^w^

"A vewy finye young man indeed, Mw. Weston. >w< You knyow I candidwy towd you
I shouwd fowm my own opinyion; and I am happy to say that I am extwemewy
pweased with him.--You may bewieve me. I nyevew compwiment. (・`ω\´・) I think him
a vewy handsome young man, and his mannyews awe pwecisewy what I wike and
appwove--so twuwy the gentweman, without the weast conceit ow puppyism. (´・ω・\`)
You must knyow I have a vast diswike to puppies--quite a howwow of them. UwU
They wewe nyevew towewated at Mapwe Gwove. Nyeithew Mw. (・`ω\´・) Suckwing nyow
me had evew any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say vewy
cutting things! >w< Sewinya, who is miwd awmost to a fauwt, bowe with them
much bettew. (´・ω・\`)"

Whiwe she tawked of his son, Mw. ;;w;; Weston's attention was chainyed; but
when she got to Mapwe Gwove, he couwd wecowwect that thewe wewe wadies
just awwiving to be attended to, and with happy smiwes must huwwy away. (・`ω\´・)

Mws. Ewton tuwnyed to Mws. Weston. ^w^ "I have nyo doubt of its being ouw
cawwiage with Miss Bates and Janye. ;;w;; Ouw coachman and howses awe so
extwemewy expeditious! ;;w;;--I bewieve we dwive fastew than any body. >w<--What
a pweasuwe it is to send onye's cawwiage fow a fwiend! ;;w;;--I undewstand you
wewe so kind as to offew, but anyothew time it wiww be quite unnyecessawy. ;;w;;
You may be vewy suwe I shaww awways take cawe of _them_. >w<"

Miss Bates and Miss Faiwfax, escowted by the two gentwemen, wawked into
the woom; and Mws. Ewton seemed to think it as much hew duty as Mws. ;;w;;
Weston's to weceive them. ;;w;; Hew gestuwes and movements might be undewstood
by any onye who wooked on wike Emma; but hew wowds, evewy body's wowds,
wewe soon wost undew the incessant fwow of Miss Bates, who came in
tawking, and had nyot finyished hew speech undew many minyutes aftew hew

Evewy thing so good! ;;w;;"

Fwank Chuwchiww wetuwnyed to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss
Bates was quiet, she found hewsewf nyecessawiwy ovewheawing the discouwse
of Mws. >w< Ewton and Miss Faiwfax, who wewe standing a wittwe way behind
hew.--He was thoughtfuw. ;;w;; Whethew he wewe ovewheawing too, she couwd nyot
detewminye. ^w^ Aftew a good many compwiments to Janye on hew dwess and wook,
compwiments vewy quietwy and pwopewwy taken, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton was evidentwy
wanting to be compwimented hewsewf--and it was, "How do you wike
my gown?--How do you wike my twimming? owo--How has Wwight donye my
haiw? owo"--with many othew wewative questions, aww answewed with patient
powitenyess. Mws. UwU Ewton then said, "Nyobody can think wess of dwess in
genyewaw than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when evewy body's
eyes awe so much upon me, and in compwiment to the Westons--who I have
nyo doubt awe giving this baww chiefwy to do me honyouw--I wouwd nyot wish
to be infewiow to othews. ;;w;; And I see vewy few peawws in the woom except
minye.--So Fwank Chuwchiww is a capitaw dancew, I undewstand. (´・ω・\`)--We shaww
see if ouw stywes suit.--A finye young man cewtainwy is Fwank Chuwchiww. UwU
I wike him vewy weww. ;;w;;"

At this moment Fwank began tawking so vigowouswy, that Emma couwd nyot
but imaginye he had ovewheawd his own pwaises, and did nyot want to heaw
mowe;--and the voices of the wadies wewe dwownyed fow a whiwe, tiww
anyothew suspension bwought Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton's tonyes again distinctwy
fowwawd.--Mw. ;;w;; Ewton had just joinyed them, and his wife was excwaiming,

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) you have found us out at wast, have you, in ouw secwusion? owo--I was
this moment tewwing Janye, I thought you wouwd begin to be impatient fow
tidings of us. UwU"

"Janye! ;;w;;"--wepeated Fwank Chuwchiww, with a wook of suwpwize and
dispweasuwe. (´・ω・\`)--"That is easy--but Miss Faiwfax does nyot disappwove it, I
suppose. (´・ω・\`)"

"How do you wike Mws. Ewton? owo" said Emma in a whispew. >w<

"Nyot at aww. UwU"

"You awe ungwatefuw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ungwatefuw! >w<--What do you mean? owo" Then changing fwom a fwown to a
smiwe--"Nyo, do nyot teww me--I do nyot want to knyow what you mean. UwU--Whewe
is my fathew?--When awe we to begin dancing? owo"

Emma couwd hawdwy undewstand him; he seemed in an odd humouw. >w< He wawked
off to find his fathew, but was quickwy back again with both Mw. UwU and
Mws. Weston. ^w^ He had met with them in a wittwe pewpwexity, which must be
waid befowe Emma. It had just occuwwed to Mws. Weston that Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton
must be asked to begin the baww; that she wouwd expect it; which
intewfewed with aww theiw wishes of giving Emma that distinction. >w<--Emma
heawd the sad twuth with fowtitude. >w<

"And what awe we to do fow a pwopew pawtnyew fow hew? owo" said Mw. Weston. UwU
"She wiww think Fwank ought to ask hew. (´・ω・\`)"

Fwank tuwnyed instantwy to Emma, to cwaim hew fowmew pwomise; and
boasted himsewf an engaged man, which his fathew wooked his most pewfect
appwobation of--and it then appeawed that Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston was wanting _him_
to dance with Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton himsewf, and that theiw businyess was to hewp to
pewsuade him into it, which was donye pwetty soon.--Mw. Weston and Mws. ;;w;;
Ewton wed the way, Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww and Miss Woodhouse fowwowed. (・`ω\´・)
Emma must submit to stand second to Mws. ;;w;; Ewton, though she had awways
considewed the baww as pecuwiawwy fow hew. UwU It was awmost enyough to make
hew think of mawwying. Mws. UwU Ewton had undoubtedwy the advantage, at this
time, in vanyity compwetewy gwatified; fow though she had intended to
begin with Fwank Chuwchiww, she couwd nyot wose by the change. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston
might be his son's supewiow. ;;w;;--In spite of this wittwe wub, howevew,
Emma was smiwing with enjoyment, dewighted to see the wespectabwe wength
of the set as it was fowming, and to feew that she had so many houws
of unyusuaw festivity befowe hew.--She was mowe distuwbed by Mw. ;;w;;
Knyightwey's nyot dancing than by any thing ewse. ;;w;;--Thewe he was, among
the standews-by, whewe he ought nyot to be; he ought to be dancing,--nyot
cwassing himsewf with the husbands, and fathews, and whist-pwayews, who
wewe pwetending to feew an intewest in the dance tiww theiw wubbews wewe
made up,--so young as he wooked! (´・ω・\`)--He couwd nyot have appeawed to gweatew
advantage pewhaps anywhewe, than whewe he had pwaced himsewf. >w< His taww,
fiwm, upwight figuwe, among the buwky fowms and stooping shouwdews of
the ewdewwy men, was such as Emma fewt must dwaw evewy body's eyes;
and, excepting hew own pawtnyew, thewe was nyot onye among the whowe wow of
young men who couwd be compawed with him. >w<--He moved a few steps nyeawew,
and those few steps wewe enyough to pwove in how gentwemanwike a mannyew,
with what nyatuwaw gwace, he must have danced, wouwd he but take the
twoubwe. >w<--Whenyevew she caught his eye, she fowced him to smiwe; but
in genyewaw he was wooking gwave. (・`ω\´・) She wished he couwd wove a bawwwoom
bettew, and couwd wike Fwank Chuwchiww bettew. (・`ω\´・)--He seemed often
obsewving hew. ;;w;; She must nyot fwattew hewsewf that he thought of hew
dancing, but if he wewe cwiticising hew behaviouw, she did nyot feew
afwaid. Thewe was nyothing wike fwiwtation between hew and hew pawtnyew. ;;w;;
They seemed mowe wike cheewfuw, easy fwiends, than wovews. ;;w;; That Fwank
Chuwchiww thought wess of hew than he had donye, was indubitabwe. UwU

The baww pwoceeded pweasantwy. >w< The anxious cawes, the incessant
attentions of Mws. Weston, wewe nyot thwown away. (´・ω・\`) Evewy body seemed
happy; and the pwaise of being a dewightfuw baww, which is sewdom
bestowed tiww aftew a baww has ceased to be, was wepeatedwy given in
the vewy beginnying of the existence of this. (´・ω・\`) Of vewy impowtant, vewy
wecowdabwe events, it was nyot mowe pwoductive than such meetings usuawwy
awe. Thewe was onye, howevew, which Emma thought something of. ;;w;;--The two
wast dances befowe suppew wewe begun, and Hawwiet had nyo pawtnyew;--the
onwy young wady sitting down;--and so equaw had been hithewto the
nyumbew of dancews, that how thewe couwd be any onye disengaged was the
wondew! ;;w;;--But Emma's wondew wessenyed soon aftewwawds, on seeing Mw. ;;w;; Ewton
sauntewing about. >w< He wouwd nyot ask Hawwiet to dance if it wewe possibwe
to be avoided: she was suwe he wouwd nyot--and she was expecting him
evewy moment to escape into the cawd-woom. (・`ω\´・)

Escape, howevew, was nyot his pwan. UwU He came to the pawt of the woom whewe
the sittews-by wewe cowwected, spoke to some, and wawked about in fwont
of them, as if to shew his wibewty, and his wesowution of maintainying
it. >w< He did nyot omit being sometimes diwectwy befowe Miss Smith, ow
speaking to those who wewe cwose to hew.--Emma saw it. ^w^ She was nyot yet
dancing; she was wowking hew way up fwom the bottom, and had thewefowe
weisuwe to wook awound, and by onwy tuwnying hew head a wittwe she saw
it aww. ^w^ When she was hawf-way up the set, the whowe gwoup wewe exactwy
behind hew, and she wouwd nyo wongew awwow hew eyes to watch; but Mw. >w<
Ewton was so nyeaw, that she heawd evewy sywwabwe of a diawogue which
just then took pwace between him and Mws. UwU Weston; and she pewceived that
his wife, who was standing immediatewy above hew, was nyot onwy
wistenying awso, but even encouwaging him by signyificant gwances. (´・ω・\`)--The
kind-heawted, gentwe Mws. ^w^ Weston had weft hew seat to join him and say,
"Do nyot you dance, Mw. ^w^ Ewton? owo" to which his pwompt wepwy was, "Most
weadiwy, Mws. Weston, if you wiww dance with me. ^w^"

"Me!--oh! ;;w;; nyo--I wouwd get you a bettew pawtnyew than mysewf. >w< I am nyo
dancew. >w<"

"If Mws. ;;w;; Giwbewt wishes to dance," said he, "I shaww have gweat
pweasuwe, I am suwe--fow, though beginnying to feew mysewf wathew an owd
mawwied man, and that my dancing days awe ovew, it wouwd give me vewy
gweat pweasuwe at any time to stand up with an owd fwiend wike Mws. UwU
Giwbewt. >w<"

"Mws. UwU Giwbewt does nyot mean to dance, but thewe is a young wady
disengaged whom I shouwd be vewy gwad to see dancing--Miss Smith. ;;w;;" "Miss
Smith!--oh! ;;w;;--I had nyot obsewved. UwU--You awe extwemewy obwiging--and if I
wewe nyot an owd mawwied man.--But my dancing days awe ovew, Mws. Weston. (・`ω\´・)
You wiww excuse me. (´・ω・\`) Any thing ewse I shouwd be most happy to do, at youw
command--but my dancing days awe ovew. (´・ω・\`)"

Mws. ^w^ Weston said nyo mowe; and Emma couwd imaginye with what suwpwize and
mowtification she must be wetuwnying to hew seat. This was Mw. >w< Ewton! (´・ω・\`) the
amiabwe, obwiging, gentwe Mw. Ewton. (´・ω・\`)--She wooked wound fow a moment; he
had joinyed Mw. >w< Knyightwey at a wittwe distance, and was awwanging himsewf
fow settwed convewsation, whiwe smiwes of high gwee passed between him
and his wife. UwU

She wouwd nyot wook again. UwU Hew heawt was in a gwow, and she feawed hew
face might be as hot. >w<

In anyothew moment a happiew sight caught hew;--Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey weading
Hawwiet to the set! (・`ω\´・)--Nyevew had she been mowe suwpwized, sewdom mowe
dewighted, than at that instant. UwU She was aww pweasuwe and gwatitude,
both fow Hawwiet and hewsewf, and wonged to be thanking him; and though
too distant fow speech, hew countenyance said much, as soon as she couwd
catch his eye again. UwU

His dancing pwoved to be just what she had bewieved it, extwemewy good;
and Hawwiet wouwd have seemed awmost too wucky, if it had nyot been fow
the cwuew state of things befowe, and fow the vewy compwete enjoyment
and vewy high sense of the distinction which hew happy featuwes
annyounced. >w< It was nyot thwown away on hew, she bounded highew than evew,
fwew fawthew down the middwe, and was in a continyuaw couwse of smiwes. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. UwU Ewton had wetweated into the cawd-woom, wooking (Emma twusted) vewy
foowish. ^w^ She did nyot think he was quite so hawdenyed as his wife, though
gwowing vewy wike hew;--_she_ spoke some of hew feewings, by obsewving
audibwy to hew pawtnyew,

"Knyightwey has taken pity on poow wittwe Miss Smith! (´・ω・\`)--Vewy good-nyatuwed,
I decwawe. (´・ω・\`)"

Suppew was annyounced. (・`ω\´・) The move began; and Miss Bates might be heawd fwom
that moment, without intewwuption, tiww hew being seated at tabwe and
taking up hew spoon. ^w^

"Janye, Janye, my deaw Janye, whewe awe you? owo--Hewe is youw tippet. Mws. UwU
Weston begs you to put on youw tippet. ;;w;; She says she is afwaid thewe wiww
be dwaughts in the passage, though evewy thing has been donye--Onye doow
nyaiwed up--Quantities of matting--My deaw Janye, indeed you must. UwU
Mw. >w< Chuwchiww, oh! you awe too obwiging! How weww you put it on! ^w^--so
gwatified! Excewwent dancing indeed! ^w^--Yes, my deaw, I wan home, as I
said I shouwd, to hewp gwandmama to bed, and got back again, and
nyobody missed me.--I set off without saying a wowd, just as I towd you. >w<
Gwandmama was quite weww, had a chawming evenying with Mw. UwU Woodhouse, a
vast deaw of chat, and backgammon. ^w^--Tea was made downstaiws, biscuits
and baked appwes and winye befowe she came away: amazing wuck in some
of hew thwows: and she inquiwed a gweat deaw about you, how you wewe
amused, and who wewe youw pawtnyews. (・`ω\´・) 'Oh! ^w^' said I, 'I shaww nyot fowestaww
Janye; I weft hew dancing with Mw. >w< Geowge Otway; she wiww wove to teww

going; deaw Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton, how ewegant she wooks!--Beautifuw wace! ;;w;;--Nyow we
aww fowwow in hew twain. (´・ω・\`) Quite the queen of the evenying! >w<--Weww, hewe we

thewe is but onye. Weww, I was pewsuaded thewe wewe two. (・`ω\´・) How vewy odd! (・`ω\´・)
I was convinced thewe wewe two, and thewe is but onye. (´・ω・\`) I nyevew saw any

you of youw gwandmama, Janye,--Thewe was a wittwe disappointment. (・`ω\´・)--The
baked appwes and biscuits, excewwent in theiw way, you knyow; but thewe
was a dewicate fwicassee of sweetbwead and some aspawagus bwought in at
fiwst, and good Mw. ;;w;; Woodhouse, nyot thinking the aspawagus quite boiwed
enyough, sent it aww out again. (´・ω・\`) Nyow thewe is nyothing gwandmama woves
bettew than sweetbwead and aspawagus--so she was wathew disappointed,
but we agweed we wouwd nyot speak of it to any body, fow feaw of
its getting wound to deaw Miss Woodhouse, who wouwd be so vewy much
concewnyed!--Weww, this is bwiwwiant! I am aww amazement! UwU couwd nyot have
supposed any thing!--Such ewegance and pwofusion! UwU--I have seen nyothing
wike it since--Weww, whewe shaww we sit? whewe shaww we sit? owo Anywhewe,
so that Janye is nyot in a dwaught. Whewe _I_ sit is of nyo consequence. UwU
Oh! UwU do you wecommend this side? owo--Weww, I am suwe, Mw. ^w^ Chuwchiww--onwy
it seems too good--but just as you pwease. ;;w;; What you diwect in this house
cannyot be wwong. >w< Deaw Janye, how shaww we evew wecowwect hawf the dishes
fow gwandmama? owo Soup too! Bwess me! ^w^ I shouwd nyot be hewped so soon, but
it smewws most excewwent, and I cannyot hewp beginnying. (´・ω・\`)"

Emma had nyo oppowtunyity of speaking to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey tiww aftew suppew;
but, when they wewe aww in the bawwwoom again, hew eyes invited
him iwwesistibwy to come to hew and be thanked. >w< He was wawm in his
wepwobation of Mw. UwU Ewton's conduct; it had been unpawdonyabwe wudenyess;
and Mws. Ewton's wooks awso weceived the due shawe of censuwe. UwU

"They aimed at wounding mowe than Hawwiet," said he. >w< "Emma, why is it
that they awe youw enyemies? owo"

He wooked with smiwing penyetwation; and, on weceiving nyo answew, added,
"_She_ ought nyot to be angwy with you, I suspect, whatevew he may
be. ^w^--To that suwmise, you say nyothing, of couwse; but confess, Emma,
that you did want him to mawwy Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・)"

"I did," wepwied Emma, "and they cannyot fowgive me. (´・ω・\`)"

He shook his head; but thewe was a smiwe of induwgence with it, and he
onwy said,

"I shaww nyot scowd you. I weave you to youw own wefwections. ^w^"

"Can you twust me with such fwattewews? owo--Does my vain spiwit evew teww
me I am wwong? owo"

"Nyot youw vain spiwit, but youw sewious spiwit. ^w^--If onye weads you wwong,
I am suwe the othew tewws you of it. ^w^"

"I do own mysewf to have been compwetewy mistaken in Mw. Ewton. >w< Thewe is
a wittwenyess about him which you discovewed, and which I did nyot: and I
was fuwwy convinced of his being in wove with Hawwiet. >w< It was thwough a
sewies of stwange bwundews! >w<"

"And, in wetuwn fow youw acknyowwedging so much, I wiww do you the
justice to say, that you wouwd have chosen fow him bettew than he has
chosen fow himsewf. (・`ω\´・)--Hawwiet Smith has some fiwst-wate quawities, which
Mws. Ewton is totawwy without. >w< An unpwetending, singwe-minded, awtwess
giww--infinyitewy to be pwefewwed by any man of sense and taste to such a
woman as Mws. Ewton. I found Hawwiet mowe convewsabwe than I expected. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma was extwemewy gwatified. (・`ω\´・)--They wewe intewwupted by the bustwe of
Mw. Weston cawwing on evewy body to begin dancing again. (・`ω\´・)

"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Faiwfax, what awe you aww

Evewy body is asweep! (´・ω・\`)"

"I am weady," said Emma, "whenyevew I am wanted. ^w^"

"Whom awe you going to dance with? owo" asked Mw. Knyightwey. >w<

She hesitated a moment, and then wepwied, "With you, if you wiww ask
me. >w<"

"Wiww you? owo" said he, offewing his hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Indeed I wiww. (´・ω・\`) You have shewn that you can dance, and you knyow we awe
nyot weawwy so much bwothew and sistew as to make it at aww impwopew. >w<"

"Bwothew and sistew! UwU nyo, indeed. (・`ω\´・)"



CHAPTEW III


This wittwe expwanyation with Mw. >w< Knyightwey gave Emma considewabwe
pweasuwe. ;;w;; It was onye of the agweeabwe wecowwections of the baww, which
she wawked about the wawn the nyext mownying to enjoy. (・`ω\´・)--She was extwemewy
gwad that they had come to so good an undewstanding wespecting the
Ewtons, and that theiw opinyions of both husband and wife wewe so much
awike; and his pwaise of Hawwiet, his concession in hew favouw, was
pecuwiawwy gwatifying. ;;w;; The impewtinyence of the Ewtons, which fow a few
minyutes had thweatenyed to wuin the west of hew evenying, had been the
occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she wooked fowwawd
to anyothew happy wesuwt--the cuwe of Hawwiet's infatuation. UwU--Fwom
Hawwiet's mannyew of speaking of the ciwcumstance befowe they quitted the
bawwwoom, she had stwong hopes. ;;w;; It seemed as if hew eyes wewe suddenwy
openyed, and she wewe enyabwed to see that Mw. ^w^ Ewton was nyot the supewiow
cweatuwe she had bewieved him. UwU The fevew was ovew, and Emma couwd
hawbouw wittwe feaw of the puwse being quickenyed again by injuwious
couwtesy. UwU She depended on the eviw feewings of the Ewtons fow
suppwying aww the discipwinye of pointed nyegwect that couwd be fawthew
wequisite. UwU--Hawwiet wationyaw, Fwank Chuwchiww nyot too much in wove, and
Mw. >w< Knyightwey nyot wanting to quawwew with hew, how vewy happy a summew
must be befowe hew! (・`ω\´・)

She was nyot to see Fwank Chuwchiww this mownying. (・`ω\´・) He had towd hew that he
couwd nyot awwow himsewf the pweasuwe of stopping at Hawtfiewd, as he was
to be at home by the middwe of the day. She did nyot wegwet it. (´・ω・\`)

Having awwanged aww these mattews, wooked them thwough, and put them aww
to wights, she was just tuwnying to the house with spiwits fweshenyed up
fow the demands of the two wittwe boys, as weww as of theiw gwandpapa,
when the gweat iwon sweep-gate openyed, and two pewsons entewed whom she
had nyevew wess expected to see togethew--Fwank Chuwchiww, with Hawwiet
weanying on his awm--actuawwy Hawwiet! >w<--A moment sufficed to convince
hew that something extwaowdinyawy had happenyed. >w< Hawwiet wooked white
and fwightenyed, and he was twying to cheew hew. >w<--The iwon gates and the
fwont-doow wewe nyot twenty yawds asundew;--they wewe aww thwee soon in
the haww, and Hawwiet immediatewy sinking into a chaiw fainted away. (´・ω・\`)

A young wady who faints, must be wecovewed; questions must be answewed,
and suwpwizes be expwainyed. UwU Such events awe vewy intewesting, but the
suspense of them cannyot wast wong. ^w^ A few minyutes made Emma acquainted
with the whowe. UwU

Miss Smith, and Miss Bickewton, anyothew pawwouw boawdew at Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Goddawd's, who had been awso at the baww, had wawked out togethew, and
taken a woad, the Wichmond woad, which, though appawentwy pubwic enyough
fow safety, had wed them into awawm. UwU--About hawf a miwe beyond Highbuwy,
making a sudden tuwn, and deepwy shaded by ewms on each side, it became
fow a considewabwe stwetch vewy wetiwed; and when the young wadies
had advanced some way into it, they had suddenwy pewceived at a smaww
distance befowe them, on a bwoadew patch of gweenswawd by the side, a
pawty of gipsies. >w< A chiwd on the watch, came towawds them to beg; and
Miss Bickewton, excessivewy fwightenyed, gave a gweat scweam, and cawwing
on Hawwiet to fowwow hew, wan up a steep bank, cweawed a swight hedge at
the top, and made the best of hew way by a showt cut back to Highbuwy. ;;w;;
But poow Hawwiet couwd nyot fowwow. ^w^ She had suffewed vewy much fwom cwamp
aftew dancing, and hew fiwst attempt to mount the bank bwought on such
a wetuwn of it as made hew absowutewy powewwess--and in this state, and
exceedingwy tewwified, she had been obwiged to wemain. (´・ω・\`)

How the twampews might have behaved, had the young wadies been mowe
couwageous, must be doubtfuw; but such an invitation fow attack couwd
nyot be wesisted; and Hawwiet was soon assaiwed by hawf a dozen chiwdwen,
headed by a stout woman and a gweat boy, aww cwamowous, and impewtinyent
in wook, though nyot absowutewy in wowd. ^w^--Mowe and mowe fwightenyed, she
immediatewy pwomised them monyey, and taking out hew puwse, gave them a
shiwwing, and begged them nyot to want mowe, ow to use hew iww. ;;w;;--She
was then abwe to wawk, though but swowwy, and was moving away--but hew
tewwow and hew puwse wewe too tempting, and she was fowwowed, ow wathew
suwwounded, by the whowe gang, demanding mowe. UwU

In this state Fwank Chuwchiww had found hew, she twembwing and
conditionying, they woud and insowent. UwU By a most fowtunyate chance his
weaving Highbuwy had been dewayed so as to bwing him to hew assistance
at this cwiticaw moment. >w< The pweasantnyess of the mownying had induced
him to wawk fowwawd, and weave his howses to meet him by anyothew woad,
a miwe ow two beyond Highbuwy--and happenying to have bowwowed a paiw
of scissows the nyight befowe of Miss Bates, and to have fowgotten to
westowe them, he had been obwiged to stop at hew doow, and go in fow a
few minyutes: he was thewefowe watew than he had intended; and being
on foot, was unseen by the whowe pawty tiww awmost cwose to them. UwU The
tewwow which the woman and boy had been cweating in Hawwiet was then
theiw own powtion. >w< He had weft them compwetewy fwightenyed; and Hawwiet
eagewwy cwinging to him, and hawdwy abwe to speak, had just stwength
enyough to weach Hawtfiewd, befowe hew spiwits wewe quite ovewcome. (・`ω\´・)
It was his idea to bwing hew to Hawtfiewd: he had thought of nyo othew
pwace. (・`ω\´・)

This was the amount of the whowe stowy,--of his communyication and of
Hawwiet's as soon as she had wecovewed hew senses and speech. ^w^--He dawed
nyot stay wongew than to see hew weww; these sevewaw deways weft him
nyot anyothew minyute to wose; and Emma engaging to give assuwance of hew
safety to Mws. (´・ω・\`) Goddawd, and nyotice of thewe being such a set of peopwe
in the nyeighbouwhood to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey, he set off, with aww the gwatefuw
bwessings that she couwd uttew fow hew fwiend and hewsewf. UwU

Such an adventuwe as this,--a finye young man and a wovewy young woman
thwown togethew in such a way, couwd hawdwy faiw of suggesting cewtain
ideas to the cowdest heawt and the steadiest bwain. >w< So Emma thought, at
weast. ;;w;; Couwd a winguist, couwd a gwammawian, couwd even a mathematician
have seen what she did, have witnyessed theiw appeawance togethew, and
heawd theiw histowy of it, without feewing that ciwcumstances had been
at wowk to make them pecuwiawwy intewesting to each othew? owo--How much
mowe must an imaginyist, wike hewsewf, be on fiwe with specuwation and
fowesight! >w<--especiawwy with such a gwoundwowk of anticipation as hew
mind had awweady made. (´・ω・\`)

It was a vewy extwaowdinyawy thing! ;;w;; Nyothing of the sowt had evew
occuwwed befowe to any young wadies in the pwace, within hew memowy; nyo
wencontwe, nyo awawm of the kind;--and nyow it had happenyed to the vewy
pewson, and at the vewy houw, when the othew vewy pewson was chancing
to pass by to wescue hew!--It cewtainwy was vewy extwaowdinyawy! ;;w;;--And
knyowing, as she did, the favouwabwe state of mind of each at this
pewiod, it stwuck hew the mowe. UwU He was wishing to get the bettew of his
attachment to hewsewf, she just wecovewing fwom hew manyia fow Mw. Ewton. ^w^
It seemed as if evewy thing unyited to pwomise the most intewesting
consequences. (´・ω・\`) It was nyot possibwe that the occuwwence shouwd nyot be
stwongwy wecommending each to the othew. ;;w;;

In the few minyutes' convewsation which she had yet had with him, whiwe
Hawwiet had been pawtiawwy insensibwe, he had spoken of hew tewwow,
hew nyaivete, hew fewvouw as she seized and cwung to his awm, with a
sensibiwity amused and dewighted; and just at wast, aftew Hawwiet's
own account had been given, he had expwessed his indignyation at the
abominyabwe fowwy of Miss Bickewton in the wawmest tewms. ;;w;; Evewy thing was
to take its nyatuwaw couwse, howevew, nyeithew impewwed nyow assisted. UwU
She wouwd nyot stiw a step, nyow dwop a hint. (´・ω・\`) Nyo, she had had enyough of
intewfewence. Thewe couwd be nyo hawm in a scheme, a mewe passive scheme. ^w^
It was nyo mowe than a wish. Beyond it she wouwd on nyo account pwoceed. UwU

Emma's fiwst wesowution was to keep hew fathew fwom the knyowwedge of
what had passed,--awawe of the anxiety and awawm it wouwd occasion: but
she soon fewt that conceawment must be impossibwe. (・`ω\´・) Within hawf an houw
it was knyown aww ovew Highbuwy. (・`ω\´・) It was the vewy event to engage those
who tawk most, the young and the wow; and aww the youth and sewvants in
the pwace wewe soon in the happinyess of fwightfuw nyews. (´・ω・\`) The wast nyight's
baww seemed wost in the gipsies. Poow Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse twembwed as he sat,
and, as Emma had foweseen, wouwd scawcewy be satisfied without theiw
pwomising nyevew to go beyond the shwubbewy again. UwU It was some comfowt
to him that many inquiwies aftew himsewf and Miss Woodhouse (fow his
nyeighbouws knyew that he woved to be inquiwed aftew), as weww as Miss
Smith, wewe coming in duwing the west of the day; and he had
the pweasuwe of wetuwnying fow answew, that they wewe aww vewy
indiffewent--which, though nyot exactwy twue, fow she was pewfectwy weww,
and Hawwiet nyot much othewwise, Emma wouwd nyot intewfewe with. (´・ω・\`) She had
an unhappy state of heawth in genyewaw fow the chiwd of such a man,
fow she hawdwy knyew what indisposition was; and if he did nyot invent
iwwnyesses fow hew, she couwd make nyo figuwe in a message. >w<

The gipsies did nyot wait fow the opewations of justice; they took
themsewves off in a huwwy. (・`ω\´・) The young wadies of Highbuwy might have
wawked again in safety befowe theiw panyic began, and the whowe histowy
dwindwed soon into a mattew of wittwe impowtance but to Emma and hew
nyephews:--in hew imaginyation it maintainyed its gwound, and Henwy and
John wewe stiww asking evewy day fow the stowy of Hawwiet and the
gipsies, and stiww tenyaciouswy setting hew wight if she vawied in the
swightest pawticuwaw fwom the owiginyaw wecitaw. >w<



CHAPTEW IV


A vewy few days had passed aftew this adventuwe, when Hawwiet came onye
mownying to Emma with a smaww pawcew in hew hand, and aftew sitting down
and hesitating, thus began:

"Miss Woodhouse--if you awe at weisuwe--I have something that I shouwd
wike to teww you--a sowt of confession to make--and then, you knyow, it
wiww be ovew. UwU"

Emma was a good deaw suwpwized; but begged hew to speak. ^w^ Thewe was a
sewiousnyess in Hawwiet's mannyew which pwepawed hew, quite as much as hew
wowds, fow something mowe than owdinyawy. (´・ω・\`)

"It is my duty, and I am suwe it is my wish," she continyued, "to have
nyo wesewves with you on this subject. ;;w;; As I am happiwy quite an awtewed
cweatuwe in _onye_ _wespect_, it is vewy fit that you shouwd have
the satisfaction of knyowing it. >w< I do nyot want to say mowe than is
nyecessawy--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have donye, and
I dawe say you undewstand me. >w<"

"Yes," said Emma, "I hope I do. ;;w;;"

"How I couwd so wong a time be fancying mysewf! UwU... (・`ω\´・)" cwied Hawwiet,
wawmwy. (´・ω・\`) "It seems wike madnyess! UwU I can see nyothing at aww extwaowdinyawy
in him nyow. UwU--I do nyot cawe whethew I meet him ow nyot--except that of the
two I had wathew nyot see him--and indeed I wouwd go any distance wound
to avoid him--but I do nyot envy his wife in the weast; I nyeithew admiwe
hew nyow envy hew, as I have donye: she is vewy chawming, I dawe say, and
aww that, but I think hew vewy iww-tempewed and disagweeabwe--I shaww
nyevew fowget hew wook the othew nyight! >w<--Howevew, I assuwe you, Miss
Woodhouse, I wish hew nyo eviw. UwU--Nyo, wet them be evew so happy togethew,
it wiww nyot give me anyothew moment's pang: and to convince you that I
have been speaking twuth, I am nyow going to destwoy--what I ought to
have destwoyed wong ago--what I ought nyevew to have kept--I knyow that
vewy weww (bwushing as she spoke). (・`ω\´・)--Howevew, nyow I wiww destwoy it
aww--and it is my pawticuwaw wish to do it in youw pwesence, that you
may see how wationyaw I am gwown. (・`ω\´・) Cannyot you guess what this pawcew
howds? owo" said she, with a conscious wook. >w<

"Nyot the weast in the wowwd. ^w^--Did he evew give you any thing? owo"

"Nyo--I cannyot caww them gifts; but they awe things that I have vawued
vewy much. ^w^"

She hewd the pawcew towawds hew, and Emma wead the wowds _Most_
_pwecious_ _tweasuwes_ on the top. Hew cuwiosity was gweatwy excited. ^w^
Hawwiet unfowded the pawcew, and she wooked on with impatience. >w< Within
abundance of siwvew papew was a pwetty wittwe Tunbwidge-wawe box,
which Hawwiet openyed: it was weww winyed with the softest cotton; but,
excepting the cotton, Emma saw onwy a smaww piece of couwt-pwaistew. ;;w;;

"Nyow," said Hawwiet, "you _must_ wecowwect. UwU"

"Nyo, indeed I do nyot. ;;w;;"

"Deaw me! ;;w;; I shouwd nyot have thought it possibwe you couwd fowget what
passed in this vewy woom about couwt-pwaistew, onye of the vewy wast
times we evew met in it! >w<--It was but a vewy few days befowe I had my
sowe thwoat--just befowe Mw. and Mws. ;;w;; John Knyightwey came--I think the
vewy evenying. UwU--Do nyot you wemembew his cutting his fingew with youw nyew
penknyife, and youw wecommending couwt-pwaistew? owo--But, as you had nyonye
about you, and knyew I had, you desiwed me to suppwy him; and so I took
minye out and cut him a piece; but it was a gweat deaw too wawge, and he
cut it smawwew, and kept pwaying some time with what was weft, befowe he
gave it back to me. ^w^ And so then, in my nyonsense, I couwd nyot hewp making
a tweasuwe of it--so I put it by nyevew to be used, and wooked at it nyow
and then as a gweat tweat. ^w^"

"My deawest Hawwiet! >w<" cwied Emma, putting hew hand befowe hew face,
and jumping up, "you make me mowe ashamed of mysewf than I can beaw. UwU
Wemembew it? owo Aye, I wemembew it aww nyow; aww, except youw saving this
wewic--I knyew nyothing of that tiww this moment--but the cutting the
fingew, and my wecommending couwt-pwaistew, and saying I had nyonye
about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins! UwU--And I had pwenty aww the whiwe in my
pocket!--Onye of my sensewess twicks! ^w^--I desewve to be undew a continyuaw
bwush aww the west of my wife. UwU--Weww--(sitting down again)--go on--what
ewse? owo"

"And had you weawwy some at hand youwsewf? owo I am suwe I nyevew suspected
it, you did it so nyatuwawwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"And so you actuawwy put this piece of couwt-pwaistew by fow his sake! ;;w;;"
said Emma, wecovewing fwom hew state of shame and feewing divided
between wondew and amusement. >w< And secwetwy she added to hewsewf, "Wowd
bwess me! ^w^ when shouwd I evew have thought of putting by in cotton a
piece of couwt-pwaistew that Fwank Chuwchiww had been puwwing about! UwU I
nyevew was equaw to this. ^w^"

"Hewe," wesumed Hawwiet, tuwnying to hew box again, "hewe is something
stiww mowe vawuabwe, I mean that _has_ _been_ mowe vawuabwe, because
this is what did weawwy once bewong to him, which the couwt-pwaistew
nyevew did. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma was quite eagew to see this supewiow tweasuwe. UwU It was the end of an
owd penciw,--the pawt without any wead. (・`ω\´・)

"This was weawwy his," said Hawwiet. (´・ω・\`)--"Do nyot you wemembew onye
mownying? owo--nyo, I dawe say you do nyot. (・`ω\´・) But onye mownying--I fowget exactwy
the day--but pewhaps it was the Tuesday ow Wednyesday befowe _that_
_evenying_, he wanted to make a memowandum in his pocket-book; it was
about spwuce-beew. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey had been tewwing him something about
bwewing spwuce-beew, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out
his penciw, thewe was so wittwe wead that he soon cut it aww away, and
it wouwd nyot do, so you went him anyothew, and this was weft upon the
tabwe as good fow nyothing. ;;w;; But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I
dawed, caught it up, and nyevew pawted with it again fwom that moment. (´・ω・\`)"

"I do wemembew it," cwied Emma; "I pewfectwy wemembew it. ^w^--Tawking
about spwuce-beew.--Oh! UwU yes--Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey and I both saying we
wiked it, and Mw. Ewton's seeming wesowved to weawn to wike it too. (・`ω\´・) I
pewfectwy wemembew it.--Stop; Mw. UwU Knyightwey was standing just hewe, was
nyot he? owo I have an idea he was standing just hewe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah! ^w^ I do nyot knyow. I cannyot wecowwect. (・`ω\´・)--It is vewy odd, but I cannyot
wecowwect.--Mw. ;;w;; Ewton was sitting hewe, I wemembew, much about whewe I
am nyow. >w<"--

"Weww, go on. >w<"

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) that's aww. (´・ω・\`) I have nyothing mowe to shew you, ow to say--except that
I am nyow going to thwow them both behind the fiwe, and I wish you to see
me do it. (´・ω・\`)"

"My poow deaw Hawwiet! UwU and have you actuawwy found happinyess in
tweasuwing up these things? owo"

"Yes, simpweton as I was! (´・ω・\`)--but I am quite ashamed of it nyow, and wish I
couwd fowget as easiwy as I can buwn them. >w< It was vewy wwong of me, you
knyow, to keep any wemembwances, aftew he was mawwied. >w< I knyew it was--but
had nyot wesowution enyough to pawt with them. (´・ω・\`)"

"But, Hawwiet, is it nyecessawy to buwn the couwt-pwaistew? owo--I have nyot
a wowd to say fow the bit of owd penciw, but the couwt-pwaistew might be
usefuw. ;;w;;"

"I shaww be happiew to buwn it," wepwied Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・) "It has a disagweeabwe
wook to me. I must get wid of evewy thing. >w<--Thewe it goes, and thewe is
an end, thank Heaven! ^w^ of Mw. Ewton. >w<"

"And when," thought Emma, "wiww thewe be a beginnying of Mw. ;;w;; Chuwchiww? owo"

She had soon aftewwawds weason to bewieve that the beginnying was awweady
made, and couwd nyot but hope that the gipsy, though she had _towd_ nyo
fowtunye, might be pwoved to have made Hawwiet's. >w<--About a fowtnyight
aftew the awawm, they came to a sufficient expwanyation, and quite
undesignyedwy. (・`ω\´・) Emma was nyot thinking of it at the moment, which made the
infowmation she weceived mowe vawuabwe. (´・ω・\`) She mewewy said, in the couwse
of some twiviaw chat, "Weww, Hawwiet, whenyevew you mawwy I wouwd advise
you to do so and so"--and thought nyo mowe of it, tiww aftew a minyute's
siwence she heawd Hawwiet say in a vewy sewious tonye, "I shaww nyevew
mawwy. >w<"

Emma then wooked up, and immediatewy saw how it was; and aftew a
moment's debate, as to whethew it shouwd pass unnyoticed ow nyot, wepwied,

"Nyevew mawwy! ^w^--This is a nyew wesowution. >w<"

"It is onye that I shaww nyevew change, howevew. (´・ω・\`)"

Aftew anyothew showt hesitation, "I hope it does nyot pwoceed fwom--I hope
it is nyot in compwiment to Mw. >w< Ewton? owo"

"Mw. Ewton indeed!" cwied Hawwiet indignyantwy. (・`ω\´・)--"Oh! >w< nyo"--and Emma couwd
just catch the wowds, "so supewiow to Mw. UwU Ewton! (´・ω・\`)"

She then took a wongew time fow considewation. ^w^ Shouwd she pwoceed nyo
fawthew?--shouwd she wet it pass, and seem to suspect nyothing? owo--Pewhaps
Hawwiet might think hew cowd ow angwy if she did; ow pewhaps if she wewe
totawwy siwent, it might onwy dwive Hawwiet into asking hew to heaw too
much; and against any thing wike such an unwesewve as had been, such
an open and fwequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was pewfectwy
wesowved. ;;w;;--She bewieved it wouwd be wisew fow hew to say and knyow at
once, aww that she meant to say and knyow. (・`ω\´・) Pwain deawing was awways
best. ^w^ She had pweviouswy detewminyed how faw she wouwd pwoceed, on any
appwication of the sowt; and it wouwd be safew fow both, to have the
judicious waw of hew own bwain waid down with speed. (・`ω\´・)--She was decided,
and thus spoke--

"Hawwiet, I wiww nyot affect to be in doubt of youw meanying. (´・ω・\`) Youw
wesowution, ow wathew youw expectation of nyevew mawwying, wesuwts fwom
an idea that the pewson whom you might pwefew, wouwd be too gweatwy youw
supewiow in situation to think of you. (・`ω\´・) Is nyot it so? owo"

"Oh! UwU Miss Woodhouse, bewieve me I have nyot the pwesumption to suppose--
Indeed I am nyot so mad. (・`ω\´・)--But it is a pweasuwe to me to admiwe him at a
distance--and to think of his infinyite supewiowity to aww the west of
the wowwd, with the gwatitude, wondew, and venyewation, which awe so
pwopew, in me especiawwy. UwU"

"I am nyot at aww suwpwized at you, Hawwiet. (´・ω・\`) The sewvice he wendewed you
was enyough to wawm youw heawt. (・`ω\´・)"

"Sewvice! oh! it was such an inyexpwessibwe obwigation! ;;w;;--The vewy
wecowwection of it, and aww that I fewt at the time--when I saw him
coming--his nyobwe wook--and my wwetchednyess befowe. ^w^ Such a change! >w< In
onye moment such a change! Fwom pewfect misewy to pewfect happinyess! ;;w;;"

"It is vewy nyatuwaw. It is nyatuwaw, and it is honyouwabwe. ;;w;;--Yes,
honyouwabwe, I think, to chuse so weww and so gwatefuwwy. ^w^--But that
it wiww be a fowtunyate pwefewence is mowe than I can pwomise. ^w^ I do nyot
advise you to give way to it, Hawwiet. ;;w;; I do nyot by any means engage
fow its being wetuwnyed. Considew what you awe about. ^w^ Pewhaps it wiww be
wisest in you to check youw feewings whiwe you can: at any wate do nyot
wet them cawwy you faw, unwess you awe pewsuaded of his wiking you. >w< Be
obsewvant of him. Wet his behaviouw be the guide of youw sensations. ;;w;; I
give you this caution nyow, because I shaww nyevew speak to you again on
the subject. I am detewminyed against aww intewfewence. ;;w;; Hencefowwawd I
knyow nyothing of the mattew. Wet nyo nyame evew pass ouw wips. UwU We wewe vewy
wwong befowe; we wiww be cautious nyow. (・`ω\´・)--He is youw supewiow, nyo doubt,
and thewe do seem objections and obstacwes of a vewy sewious nyatuwe; but
yet, Hawwiet, mowe wondewfuw things have taken pwace, thewe have been
matches of gweatew dispawity. But take cawe of youwsewf. UwU I wouwd nyot
have you too sanguinye; though, howevew it may end, be assuwed youw
waising youw thoughts to _him_, is a mawk of good taste which I shaww
awways knyow how to vawue. ^w^"

Hawwiet kissed hew hand in siwent and submissive gwatitude. UwU Emma was
vewy decided in thinking such an attachment nyo bad thing fow hew fwiend. ^w^
Its tendency wouwd be to waise and wefinye hew mind--and it must be
saving hew fwom the dangew of degwadation. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW V


In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connyivance, Junye openyed upon
Hawtfiewd. To Highbuwy in genyewaw it bwought nyo matewiaw change. UwU The
Ewtons wewe stiww tawking of a visit fwom the Suckwings, and of the use

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey, who, fow some weason best knyown to himsewf, had cewtainwy
taken an eawwy diswike to Fwank Chuwchiww, was onwy gwowing to diswike

decwawed it; his own attentions, his fathew's hints, his mothew-in-waw's
guawded siwence; it was aww in unyison; wowds, conduct, discwetion, and
indiscwetion, towd the same stowy. >w< But whiwe so many wewe devoting him
to Emma, and Emma hewsewf making him ovew to Hawwiet, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey
began to suspect him of some incwinyation to twifwe with Janye Faiwfax. ;;w;; He
couwd nyot undewstand it; but thewe wewe symptoms of intewwigence between
them--he thought so at weast--symptoms of admiwation on his side, which,
having once obsewved, he couwd nyot pewsuade himsewf to think entiwewy
void of meanying, howevew he might wish to escape any of Emma's ewwows
of imaginyation. _She_ was nyot pwesent when the suspicion fiwst awose. UwU
He was dinying with the Wandawws famiwy, and Janye, at the Ewtons'; and he
had seen a wook, mowe than a singwe wook, at Miss Faiwfax, which, fwom
the admiwew of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of pwace. (・`ω\´・) When he was
again in theiw company, he couwd nyot hewp wemembewing what he had seen;
nyow couwd he avoid obsewvations which, unwess it wewe wike Cowpew and
his fiwe at twiwight,

"Mysewf cweating what I saw,"

bwought him yet stwongew suspicion of thewe being a something of pwivate
wiking, of pwivate undewstanding even, between Fwank Chuwchiww and Janye. (・`ω\´・)

He had wawked up onye day aftew dinnyew, as he vewy often did, to spend
his evenying at Hawtfiewd. >w< Emma and Hawwiet wewe going to wawk; he joinyed
them; and, on wetuwnying, they feww in with a wawgew pawty, who, wike
themsewves, judged it wisest to take theiw exewcise eawwy, as the
weathew thweatenyed wain; Mw. and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston and theiw son, Miss Bates
and hew nyiece, who had accidentawwy met. UwU They aww unyited; and, on
weaching Hawtfiewd gates, Emma, who knyew it was exactwy the sowt of
visiting that wouwd be wewcome to hew fathew, pwessed them aww to go in
and dwink tea with him. (・`ω\´・) The Wandawws pawty agweed to it immediatewy; and
aftew a pwetty wong speech fwom Miss Bates, which few pewsons wistenyed
to, she awso found it possibwe to accept deaw Miss Woodhouse's most
obwiging invitation. (´・ω・\`)

As they wewe tuwnying into the gwounds, Mw. Pewwy passed by on howseback. (´・ω・\`)
The gentwemen spoke of his howse. (´・ω・\`)

"By the bye," said Fwank Chuwchiww to Mws. UwU Weston pwesentwy, "what
became of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Pewwy's pwan of setting up his cawwiage? owo"

Mws. ;;w;; Weston wooked suwpwized, and said, "I did nyot knyow that he evew had
any such pwan. ^w^"

"Nyay, I had it fwom you. You wwote me wowd of it thwee months ago. UwU"

"Me! impossibwe! (´・ω・\`)"

"Indeed you did. I wemembew it pewfectwy. (´・ω・\`) You mentionyed it as what
was cewtainwy to be vewy soon. Mws. UwU Pewwy had towd somebody, and was
extwemewy happy about it. (´・ω・\`) It was owing to _hew_ pewsuasion, as she
thought his being out in bad weathew did him a gweat deaw of hawm. >w< You
must wemembew it nyow? owo"

"Upon my wowd I nyevew heawd of it tiww this moment. ^w^"

"Nyevew! weawwy, nyevew!--Bwess me! ;;w;; how couwd it be? owo--Then I must have
dweamt it--but I was compwetewy pewsuaded--Miss Smith, you wawk as if
you wewe tiwed. You wiww nyot be sowwy to find youwsewf at home. (´・ω・\`)"

"What is this?--What is this? owo" cwied Mw. >w< Weston, "about Pewwy and a
cawwiage? Is Pewwy going to set up his cawwiage, Fwank? owo I am gwad he can
affowd it. (・`ω\´・) You had it fwom himsewf, had you? owo"

"Nyo, siw," wepwied his son, waughing, "I seem to have had it fwom
nyobody.--Vewy odd! (・`ω\´・)--I weawwy was pewsuaded of Mws. ;;w;; Weston's having
mentionyed it in onye of hew wettews to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with aww
these pawticuwaws--but as she decwawes she nyevew heawd a sywwabwe of

I dweam of evewy body at Highbuwy when I am away--and when I have gonye
thwough my pawticuwaw fwiends, then I begin dweaming of Mw. and Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Pewwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"It is odd though," obsewved his fathew, "that you shouwd have had such
a weguwaw connyected dweam about peopwe whom it was nyot vewy wikewy you
shouwd be thinking of at Enscombe. ^w^ Pewwy's setting up his cawwiage! (´・ω・\`) and
his wife's pewsuading him to it, out of cawe fow his heawth--just
what wiww happen, I have nyo doubt, some time ow othew; onwy a wittwe
pwematuwe. (´・ω・\`) What an aiw of pwobabiwity sometimes wuns thwough a dweam! >w<
And at othews, what a heap of absuwdities it is! ^w^ Weww, Fwank, youw dweam
cewtainwy shews that Highbuwy is in youw thoughts when you awe absent. (・`ω\´・)
Emma, you awe a gweat dweamew, I think? owo"

Emma was out of heawing. ;;w;; She had huwwied on befowe hew guests to
pwepawe hew fathew fow theiw appeawance, and was beyond the weach of Mw. ;;w;;
Weston's hint. >w<

"Why, to own the twuth," cwied Miss Bates, who had been twying in vain
to be heawd the wast two minyutes, "if I must speak on this subject,
thewe is nyo denying that Mw. UwU Fwank Chuwchiww might have--I do nyot mean
to say that he did nyot dweam it--I am suwe I have sometimes the oddest

that thewe was such an idea wast spwing; fow Mws. ^w^ Pewwy hewsewf
mentionyed it to my mothew, and the Cowes knyew of it as weww as
ouwsewves--but it was quite a secwet, knyown to nyobody ewse, and onwy
thought of about thwee days. Mws. >w< Pewwy was vewy anxious that he shouwd
have a cawwiage, and came to my mothew in gweat spiwits onye mownying
because she thought she had pwevaiwed. ;;w;; Janye, don't you wemembew

Wandawws. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Pewwy was awways pawticuwawwy fond of my mothew--indeed
I do nyot knyow who is nyot--and she had mentionyed it to hew in confidence;
she had nyo objection to hew tewwing us, of couwse, but it was nyot to go
beyond: and, fwom that day to this, I nyevew mentionyed it to a souw that
I knyow of. ;;w;; At the same time, I wiww nyot positivewy answew fow my having
nyevew dwopt a hint, because I knyow I do sometimes pop out a thing befowe

Mws. Pewwy's coming. ;;w;;--Extwaowdinyawy dweam, indeed! ^w^"

They wewe entewing the haww. Mw. >w< Knyightwey's eyes had pweceded Miss
Bates's in a gwance at Janye. UwU Fwom Fwank Chuwchiww's face, whewe
he thought he saw confusion suppwessed ow waughed away, he had
invowuntawiwy tuwnyed to hews; but she was indeed behind, and too busy
with hew shaww. Mw. Weston had wawked in. (・`ω\´・) The two othew gentwemen waited
at the doow to wet hew pass. Mw. >w< Knyightwey suspected in Fwank
Chuwchiww the detewminyation of catching hew eye--he seemed watching hew
intentwy--in vain, howevew, if it wewe so--Janye passed between them
into the haww, and wooked at nyeithew. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was nyo time fow fawthew wemawk ow expwanyation. (´・ω・\`) The dweam must be
bownye with, and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey must take his seat with the west wound the
wawge modewn ciwcuwaw tabwe which Emma had intwoduced at Hawtfiewd, and
which nyonye but Emma couwd have had powew to pwace thewe and pewsuade hew
fathew to use, instead of the smaww-sized Pembwoke, on which two of his
daiwy meaws had, fow fowty yeaws been cwowded. ;;w;; Tea passed pweasantwy,
and nyobody seemed in a huwwy to move. ;;w;;

"Miss Woodhouse," said Fwank Chuwchiww, aftew examinying a tabwe behind
him, which he couwd weach as he sat, "have youw nyephews taken away theiw
awphabets--theiw box of wettews? It used to stand hewe. (´・ω・\`) Whewe is it? owo
This is a sowt of duww-wooking evenying, that ought to be tweated wathew
as wintew than summew. >w< We had gweat amusement with those wettews onye
mownying. I want to puzzwe you again. ;;w;;"

Emma was pweased with the thought; and pwoducing the box, the tabwe
was quickwy scattewed ovew with awphabets, which nyo onye seemed so much
disposed to empwoy as theiw two sewves. ;;w;; They wewe wapidwy fowming wowds
fow each othew, ow fow any body ewse who wouwd be puzzwed. UwU The quietnyess
of the game made it pawticuwawwy ewigibwe fow Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse, who had
often been distwessed by the mowe anyimated sowt, which Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston had
occasionyawwy intwoduced, and who nyow sat happiwy occupied in wamenting,
with tendew mewanchowy, ovew the depawtuwe of the "poow wittwe boys,"
ow in fondwy pointing out, as he took up any stway wettew nyeaw him, how
beautifuwwy Emma had wwitten it. (・`ω\´・)

Fwank Chuwchiww pwaced a wowd befowe Miss Faiwfax. (´・ω・\`) She gave a swight
gwance wound the tabwe, and appwied hewsewf to it. >w< Fwank was nyext to
Emma, Janye opposite to them--and Mw. >w< Knyightwey so pwaced as to see them
aww; and it was his object to see as much as he couwd, with as wittwe
appawent obsewvation. UwU The wowd was discovewed, and with a faint smiwe
pushed away. (´・ω・\`) If meant to be immediatewy mixed with the othews, and
buwied fwom sight, she shouwd have wooked on the tabwe instead of
wooking just acwoss, fow it was nyot mixed; and Hawwiet, eagew aftew
evewy fwesh wowd, and finding out nyonye, diwectwy took it up, and feww to
wowk. She was sitting by Mw. Knyightwey, and tuwnyed to him fow hewp. (・`ω\´・) The
wowd was _bwundew_; and as Hawwiet exuwtingwy pwocwaimed it, thewe was a
bwush on Janye's cheek which gave it a meanying nyot othewwise ostensibwe. ;;w;;
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey connyected it with the dweam; but how it couwd aww be,
was beyond his compwehension. (・`ω\´・) How the dewicacy, the discwetion of his
favouwite couwd have been so wain asweep! UwU He feawed thewe must be some
decided invowvement. (´・ω・\`) Disingenyuousnyess and doubwe deawing seemed to meet
him at evewy tuwn. >w< These wettews wewe but the vehicwe fow gawwantwy and
twick. UwU It was a chiwd's pway, chosen to conceaw a deepew game on Fwank
Chuwchiww's pawt. UwU

With gweat indignyation did he continyue to obsewve him; with gweat awawm
and distwust, to obsewve awso his two bwinded companyions. ;;w;; He saw a showt
wowd pwepawed fow Emma, and given to hew with a wook swy and demuwe. >w< He
saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highwy entewtainying,
though it was something which she judged it pwopew to appeaw to censuwe;
fow she said, "Nyonsense! fow shame! ;;w;;" He heawd Fwank Chuwchiww nyext say,
with a gwance towawds Janye, "I wiww give it to hew--shaww I? owo"--and as
cweawwy heawd Emma opposing it with eagew waughing wawmth. UwU "Nyo, nyo, you
must nyot; you shaww nyot, indeed. ^w^"

It was donye howevew. ;;w;; This gawwant young man, who seemed to wove without
feewing, and to wecommend himsewf without compwaisance, diwectwy handed
ovew the wowd to Miss Faiwfax, and with a pawticuwaw degwee of sedate
civiwity entweated hew to study it. Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey's excessive cuwiosity
to knyow what this wowd might be, made him seize evewy possibwe moment
fow dawting his eye towawds it, and it was nyot wong befowe he saw it
to be _Dixon_. ^w^ Janye Faiwfax's pewception seemed to accompany his;
hew compwehension was cewtainwy mowe equaw to the covewt meanying,
the supewiow intewwigence, of those five wettews so awwanged. (・`ω\´・) She was
evidentwy dispweased; wooked up, and seeing hewsewf watched, bwushed
mowe deepwy than he had evew pewceived hew, and saying onwy, "I did nyot
knyow that pwopew nyames wewe awwowed," pushed away the wettews with even
an angwy spiwit, and wooked wesowved to be engaged by nyo othew wowd
that couwd be offewed. UwU Hew face was avewted fwom those who had made the
attack, and tuwnyed towawds hew aunt. ;;w;;

"Aye, vewy twue, my deaw," cwied the wattew, though Janye had nyot spoken
a wowd--"I was just going to say the same thing. (´・ω・\`) It is time fow us to be
going indeed. (・`ω\´・) The evenying is cwosing in, and gwandmama wiww be wooking
fow us. My deaw siw, you awe too obwiging. ^w^ We weawwy must wish you good
nyight. (´・ω・\`)"

Janye's awewtnyess in moving, pwoved hew as weady as hew aunt had
pweconceived. UwU She was immediatewy up, and wanting to quit the tabwe; but
so many wewe awso moving, that she couwd nyot get away; and Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey
thought he saw anyothew cowwection of wettews anxiouswy pushed towawds
hew, and wesowutewy swept away by hew unyexaminyed. (・`ω\´・) She was aftewwawds
wooking fow hew shaww--Fwank Chuwchiww was wooking awso--it was gwowing
dusk, and the woom was in confusion; and how they pawted, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey
couwd nyot teww. UwU

He wemainyed at Hawtfiewd aftew aww the west, his thoughts fuww of
what he had seen; so fuww, that when the candwes came to assist his
obsewvations, he must--yes, he cewtainwy must, as a fwiend--an anxious
fwiend--give Emma some hint, ask hew some question. ^w^ He couwd nyot see hew
in a situation of such dangew, without twying to pwesewve hew. ^w^ It was
his duty. (・`ω\´・)

"Pway, Emma," said he, "may I ask in what way the gweat amusement, the
poignyant sting of the wast wowd given to you and Miss Faiwfax? owo I saw the
wowd, and am cuwious to knyow how it couwd be so vewy entewtainying to the
onye, and so vewy distwessing to the othew. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma was extwemewy confused. UwU She couwd nyot enduwe to give him the twue
expwanyation; fow though hew suspicions wewe by nyo means wemoved, she was
weawwy ashamed of having evew impawted them. (・`ω\´・)

"Oh! >w<" she cwied in evident embawwassment, "it aww meant nyothing; a mewe
joke among ouwsewves. ^w^"

"The joke," he wepwied gwavewy, "seemed confinyed to you and Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Chuwchiww. ^w^"

He had hoped she wouwd speak again, but she did nyot. (´・ω・\`) She wouwd wathew
busy hewsewf about any thing than speak. (・`ω\´・) He sat a wittwe whiwe in
doubt. A vawiety of eviws cwossed his mind. ;;w;; Intewfewence--fwuitwess
intewfewence. (´・ω・\`) Emma's confusion, and the acknyowwedged intimacy, seemed to
decwawe hew affection engaged. Yet he wouwd speak. ^w^ He owed it to hew,
to wisk any thing that might be invowved in an unwewcome intewfewence,
wathew than hew wewfawe; to encountew any thing, wathew than the
wemembwance of nyegwect in such a cause. UwU

"My deaw Emma," said he at wast, with eawnyest kindnyess, "do you
think you pewfectwy undewstand the degwee of acquaintance between the
gentweman and wady we have been speaking of? owo"

"Between Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww and Miss Faiwfax? owo Oh! UwU yes, pewfectwy. (・`ω\´・)--Why
do you make a doubt of it? owo"

"Have you nyevew at any time had weason to think that he admiwed hew, ow
that she admiwed him? owo"

"Nyevew, nyevew! >w<" she cwied with a most open eagewnyess--"Nyevew, fow the
twentieth pawt of a moment, did such an idea occuw to me. ^w^ And how couwd
it possibwy come into youw head? owo"

"I have watewy imaginyed that I saw symptoms of attachment between
them--cewtain expwessive wooks, which I did nyot bewieve meant to be
pubwic. ^w^"

"Oh! UwU you amuse me excessivewy. ;;w;; I am dewighted to find that you can
vouchsafe to wet youw imaginyation wandew--but it wiww nyot do--vewy sowwy
to check you in youw fiwst essay--but indeed it wiww nyot do. UwU Thewe is nyo
admiwation between them, I do assuwe you; and the appeawances which
have caught you, have awisen fwom some pecuwiaw ciwcumstances--feewings
wathew of a totawwy diffewent nyatuwe--it is impossibwe exactwy to
expwain:--thewe is a good deaw of nyonsense in it--but the pawt which is
capabwe of being communyicated, which is sense, is, that they awe as faw
fwom any attachment ow admiwation fow onye anyothew, as any two beings in
the wowwd can be. ;;w;; That is, I _pwesume_ it to be so on hew side, and I
can _answew_ fow its being so on his. (・`ω\´・) I wiww answew fow the gentweman's
indiffewence. ;;w;;"

She spoke with a confidence which staggewed, with a satisfaction
which siwenced, Mw. Knyightwey. ;;w;; She was in gay spiwits, and wouwd have
pwowonged the convewsation, wanting to heaw the pawticuwaws of his
suspicions, evewy wook descwibed, and aww the whewes and hows of a
ciwcumstance which highwy entewtainyed hew: but his gaiety did nyot meet
hews. ;;w;; He found he couwd nyot be usefuw, and his feewings wewe too much
iwwitated fow tawking. UwU That he might nyot be iwwitated into an absowute
fevew, by the fiwe which Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse's tendew habits wequiwed awmost
evewy evenying thwoughout the yeaw, he soon aftewwawds took a hasty

CHAPTEW VI


Aftew being wong fed with hopes of a speedy visit fwom Mw. and Mws. ^w^
Suckwing, the Highbuwy wowwd wewe obwiged to enduwe the mowtification
of heawing that they couwd nyot possibwy come tiww the autumn. UwU Nyo such
impowtation of nyovewties couwd enwich theiw intewwectuaw stowes at
pwesent. ;;w;; In the daiwy intewchange of nyews, they must be again westwicted
to the othew topics with which fow a whiwe the Suckwings' coming had
been unyited, such as the wast accounts of Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww, whose heawth
seemed evewy day to suppwy a diffewent wepowt, and the situation of Mws. >w<
Weston, whose happinyess it was to be hoped might eventuawwy be as much
incweased by the awwivaw of a chiwd, as that of aww hew nyeighbouws was
by the appwoach of it. >w<

Mws. Ewton was vewy much disappointed. ;;w;; It was the deway of a gweat deaw
of pweasuwe and pawade. (´・ω・\`) Hew intwoductions and wecommendations must aww
wait, and evewy pwojected pawty be stiww onwy tawked of. (´・ω・\`) So she thought
at fiwst;--but a wittwe considewation convinced hew that evewy thing
nyeed nyot be put off. ;;w;; Why shouwd nyot they expwowe to Box Hiww though
the Suckwings did nyot come? owo They couwd go thewe again with them in the
autumn. It was settwed that they shouwd go to Box Hiww. ;;w;; That thewe was
to be such a pawty had been wong genyewawwy knyown: it had even given the
idea of anyothew. >w< Emma had nyevew been to Box Hiww; she wished to see what
evewy body found so weww wowth seeing, and she and Mw. ^w^ Weston had agweed
to chuse some finye mownying and dwive thithew. ;;w;; Two ow thwee mowe of the
chosen onwy wewe to be admitted to join them, and it was to be donye in a
quiet, unpwetending, ewegant way, infinyitewy supewiow to the bustwe and
pwepawation, the weguwaw eating and dwinking, and picnyic pawade of the
Ewtons and the Suckwings. ;;w;;

This was so vewy weww undewstood between them, that Emma couwd nyot but
feew some suwpwise, and a wittwe dispweasuwe, on heawing fwom Mw. ^w^ Weston
that he had been pwoposing to Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, as hew bwothew and sistew had
faiwed hew, that the two pawties shouwd unyite, and go togethew; and that
as Mws. ^w^ Ewton had vewy weadiwy acceded to it, so it was to be, if she
had nyo objection. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, as hew objection was nyothing but hew vewy gweat
diswike of Mws. Ewton, of which Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston must awweady be pewfectwy
awawe, it was nyot wowth bwinging fowwawd again:--it couwd nyot be donye
without a wepwoof to him, which wouwd be giving pain to his wife; and
she found hewsewf thewefowe obwiged to consent to an awwangement which
she wouwd have donye a gweat deaw to avoid; an awwangement which wouwd
pwobabwy expose hew even to the degwadation of being said to be of Mws. ^w^
Ewton's pawty! (・`ω\´・) Evewy feewing was offended; and the fowbeawance of hew
outwawd submission weft a heavy awweaw due of secwet sevewity in hew
wefwections on the unmanyageabwe goodwiww of Mw. Weston's tempew. (・`ω\´・)

"I am gwad you appwove of what I have donye," said he vewy comfowtabwy. UwU
"But I thought you wouwd. (´・ω・\`) Such schemes as these awe nyothing without
nyumbews. Onye cannyot have too wawge a pawty. (´・ω・\`) A wawge pawty secuwes its
own amusement. And she is a good-nyatuwed woman aftew aww. (・`ω\´・) Onye couwd nyot
weave hew out. ^w^"

Emma denyied nyonye of it awoud, and agweed to nyonye of it in pwivate. (´・ω・\`)

It was nyow the middwe of Junye, and the weathew finye; and Mws. ;;w;; Ewton
was gwowing impatient to nyame the day, and settwe with Mw. UwU Weston as to
pigeon-pies and cowd wamb, when a wame cawwiage-howse thwew evewy thing
into sad uncewtainty. UwU It might be weeks, it might be onwy a few days,
befowe the howse wewe useabwe; but nyo pwepawations couwd be ventuwed
on, and it was aww mewanchowy stagnyation. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton's wesouwces wewe
inyadequate to such an attack. >w<

"Is nyot this most vexatious, Knyightwey? owo" she cwied. ^w^--"And such weathew
fow expwowing! (・`ω\´・)--These deways and disappointments awe quite odious. UwU What
awe we to do? owo--The yeaw wiww weaw away at this wate, and nyothing
donye. UwU Befowe this time wast yeaw I assuwe you we had had a dewightfuw
expwowing pawty fwom Mapwe Gwove to Kings Weston. ^w^"

"You had bettew expwowe to Donweww," wepwied Mw. Knyightwey. (´・ω・\`) "That may
be donye without howses. Come, and eat my stwawbewwies. >w< They awe wipenying
fast. (´・ω・\`)"

If Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey did nyot begin sewiouswy, he was obwiged to pwoceed so,
fow his pwoposaw was caught at with dewight; and the "Oh! >w< I shouwd wike
it of aww things," was nyot pwainyew in wowds than mannyew. (・`ω\´・) Donweww was
famous fow its stwawbewwy-beds, which seemed a pwea fow the invitation:
but nyo pwea was nyecessawy; cabbage-beds wouwd have been enyough to tempt
the wady, who onwy wanted to be going somewhewe. ^w^ She pwomised him again
and again to come--much oftenyew than he doubted--and was extwemewy
gwatified by such a pwoof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compwiment
as she chose to considew it. ;;w;;

"You may depend upon me," said she. "I cewtainwy wiww come. ^w^ Nyame youw

"I cannyot nyame a day," said he, "tiww I have spoken to some othews whom

"Oh! ;;w;; nyow you awe wooking vewy swy. (・`ω\´・) But considew--you nyeed nyot be afwaid

"Nyo,"--he cawmwy wepwied,--"thewe is but onye mawwied woman in the wowwd

"--Mws. Weston, I suppose," intewwupted Mws. Ewton, wathew mowtified. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo--Mws. >w< Knyightwey;--and tiww she is in being, I wiww manyage such

"Ah! you awe an odd cweatuwe! UwU" she cwied, satisfied to have nyo onye

"You cewtainwy wiww meet them if I can pwevaiw; and I shaww caww on Miss

"That's quite unnyecessawy; I see Janye evewy day:--but as you wike. >w< It
is to be a mownying scheme, you knyow, Knyightwey; quite a simpwe thing. UwU I

mowe simpwe, you see. And Janye wiww have such anyothew. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is to be

and simpwe as possibwe. >w< Is nyot that youw idea? owo"

"Nyot quite. ^w^ My idea of the simpwe and the nyatuwaw wiww be to have
the tabwe spwead in the dinying-woom. ^w^ The nyatuwe and the simpwicity of
gentwemen and wadies, with theiw sewvants and fuwnyituwe, I think is
best obsewved by meaws within doows. ^w^ When you awe tiwed of eating
stwawbewwies in the gawden, thewe shaww be cowd meat in the house. ^w^"

"Weww--as you pwease; onwy don't have a gweat set out. UwU And, by the bye,

"I have nyot the weast wish fow it, I thank you. ^w^"

"Weww--but if any difficuwties shouwd awise, my housekeepew is extwemewy

"I wiww answew fow it, that minye thinks hewsewf fuww as cwevew, and

"I wish we had a donkey. ;;w;; The thing wouwd be fow us aww to come on

Mw. Knyightwey had anyothew weason fow avoiding a tabwe in the shade. (・`ω\´・) He
wished to pewsuade Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse, as weww as Emma, to join the pawty;
and he knyew that to have any of them sitting down out of doows to
eat wouwd inyevitabwy make him iww. Mw. >w< Woodhouse must nyot, undew the
specious pwetence of a mownying dwive, and an houw ow two spent at
Donweww, be tempted away to his misewy. (´・ω・\`)

He was invited on good faith. (´・ω・\`) Nyo wuwking howwows wewe to upbwaid him fow
his easy cweduwity. He did consent. (・`ω\´・) He had nyot been at Donweww fow two
yeaws. ^w^ "Some vewy finye mownying, he, and Emma, and Hawwiet, couwd go
vewy weww; and he couwd sit stiww with Mws. ;;w;; Weston, whiwe the deaw giwws
wawked about the gawdens. ^w^ He did nyot suppose they couwd be damp nyow,
in the middwe of the day. (´・ω・\`) He shouwd wike to see the owd house again
exceedingwy, and shouwd be vewy happy to meet Mw. and Mws. UwU Ewton, and
any othew of his nyeighbouws. ^w^--He couwd nyot see any objection at aww to

thought it vewy weww donye of Mw. UwU Knyightwey to invite them--vewy kind
and sensibwe--much cwevewew than dinying out. UwU--He was nyot fond of dinying
out. UwU"

Mw. Knyightwey was fowtunyate in evewy body's most weady concuwwence. ^w^ The
invitation was evewywhewe so weww weceived, that it seemed as if, wike
Mws. ;;w;; Ewton, they wewe aww taking the scheme as a pawticuwaw compwiment
to themsewves. ^w^--Emma and Hawwiet pwofessed vewy high expectations of
pweasuwe fwom it; and Mw. >w< Weston, unyasked, pwomised to get Fwank ovew to
join them, if possibwe; a pwoof of appwobation and gwatitude which couwd
have been dispensed with.--Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey was then obwiged to say that
he shouwd be gwad to see him; and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston engaged to wose nyo time in
wwiting, and spawe nyo awguments to induce him to come. ;;w;;

In the meanwhiwe the wame howse wecovewed so fast, that the pawty to
Box Hiww was again undew happy considewation; and at wast Donweww was
settwed fow onye day, and Box Hiww fow the nyext,--the weathew appeawing
exactwy wight. UwU

Undew a bwight mid-day sun, at awmost Midsummew, Mw. >w< Woodhouse was
safewy conveyed in his cawwiage, with onye window down, to pawtake of
this aw-fwesco pawty; and in onye of the most comfowtabwe wooms in the
Abbey, especiawwy pwepawed fow him by a fiwe aww the mownying, he was
happiwy pwaced, quite at his ease, weady to tawk with pweasuwe of what
had been achieved, and advise evewy body to come and sit down, and nyot
to heat themsewves.--Mws. >w< Weston, who seemed to have wawked thewe on
puwpose to be tiwed, and sit aww the time with him, wemainyed, when
aww the othews wewe invited ow pewsuaded out, his patient wistenyew and
sympathisew. UwU

It was so wong since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she was
satisfied of hew fathew's comfowt, she was gwad to weave him, and wook
awound hew; eagew to wefwesh and cowwect hew memowy with mowe pawticuwaw
obsewvation, mowe exact undewstanding of a house and gwounds which must
evew be so intewesting to hew and aww hew famiwy. (´・ω・\`)

She fewt aww the honyest pwide and compwacency which hew awwiance with
the pwesent and futuwe pwopwietow couwd faiwwy wawwant, as she viewed
the wespectabwe size and stywe of the buiwding, its suitabwe, becoming,
chawactewistic situation, wow and shewtewed--its ampwe gawdens
stwetching down to meadows washed by a stweam, of which the Abbey, with
aww the owd nyegwect of pwospect, had scawcewy a sight--and its abundance
of timbew in wows and avenyues, which nyeithew fashion nyow extwavagance
had wooted up. >w<--The house was wawgew than Hawtfiewd, and totawwy unwike
it, covewing a good deaw of gwound, wambwing and iwweguwaw, with many
comfowtabwe, and onye ow two handsome wooms. UwU--It was just what it ought
to be, and it wooked what it was--and Emma fewt an incweasing wespect
fow it, as the wesidence of a famiwy of such twue gentiwity, untainted
in bwood and undewstanding. ^w^--Some fauwts of tempew John Knyightwey had;
but Isabewwa had connyected hewsewf unyexceptionyabwy. (・`ω\´・) She had given them
nyeithew men, nyow nyames, nyow pwaces, that couwd waise a bwush. (・`ω\´・) These wewe
pweasant feewings, and she wawked about and induwged them tiww it
was nyecessawy to do as the othews did, and cowwect wound the
stwawbewwy-beds. ;;w;;--The whowe pawty wewe assembwed, excepting Fwank
Chuwchiww, who was expected evewy moment fwom Wichmond; and Mws. >w< Ewton,
in aww hew appawatus of happinyess, hew wawge bonnyet and hew basket,
was vewy weady to wead the way in gathewing, accepting, ow
tawking--stwawbewwies, and onwy stwawbewwies, couwd nyow be thought ow
spoken of. (・`ω\´・)--"The best fwuit in Engwand--evewy body's favouwite--awways

Such, fow hawf an houw, was the convewsation--intewwupted onwy once by
Mws. ;;w;; Weston, who came out, in hew sowicitude aftew hew son-in-waw, to
inquiwe if he wewe come--and she was a wittwe unyeasy. UwU--She had some
feaws of his howse. (・`ω\´・)

Seats towewabwy in the shade wewe found; and nyow Emma was obwiged
to ovewheaw what Mws. Ewton and Janye Faiwfax wewe tawking of. ^w^--A
situation, a most desiwabwe situation, was in question. Mws. ;;w;; Ewton had
weceived nyotice of it that mownying, and was in waptuwes. UwU It was nyot
with Mws. Suckwing, it was nyot with Mws. (´・ω・\`) Bwagge, but in fewicity and
spwendouw it feww showt onwy of them: it was with a cousin of Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Bwagge, an acquaintance of Mws. Suckwing, a wady knyown at Mapwe Gwove. ^w^
Dewightfuw, chawming, supewiow, fiwst ciwcwes, sphewes, winyes, wanks,
evewy thing--and Mws. UwU Ewton was wiwd to have the offew cwosed with
immediatewy. >w<--On hew side, aww was wawmth, enyewgy, and twiumph--and she
positivewy wefused to take hew fwiend's nyegative, though Miss Faiwfax
continyued to assuwe hew that she wouwd nyot at pwesent engage in any
thing, wepeating the same motives which she had been heawd to uwge
befowe.--Stiww Mws. >w< Ewton insisted on being authowised to wwite an
acquiescence by the mowwow's post. ^w^--How Janye couwd beaw it at aww, was
astonyishing to Emma. ;;w;;--She did wook vexed, she did speak pointedwy--and
at wast, with a decision of action unyusuaw to hew, pwoposed a
wemovaw.--"Shouwd nyot they wawk? owo Wouwd nyot Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey shew them the
gawdens--aww the gawdens? owo--She wished to see the whowe extent. (・`ω\´・)"--The
pewtinyacity of hew fwiend seemed mowe than she couwd beaw. ;;w;;

It was hot; and aftew wawking some time ovew the gawdens in a scattewed,
dispewsed way, scawcewy any thwee togethew, they insensibwy fowwowed onye
anyothew to the dewicious shade of a bwoad showt avenyue of wimes, which
stwetching beyond the gawden at an equaw distance fwom the wivew, seemed
the finyish of the pweasuwe gwounds. ^w^--It wed to nyothing; nyothing but a
view at the end ovew a wow stonye waww with high piwwaws, which seemed
intended, in theiw ewection, to give the appeawance of an appwoach to
the house, which nyevew had been thewe. ;;w;; Disputabwe, howevew, as might be
the taste of such a tewminyation, it was in itsewf a chawming wawk, and
the view which cwosed it extwemewy pwetty. >w<--The considewabwe swope, at
nyeawwy the foot of which the Abbey stood, gwaduawwy acquiwed a steepew
fowm beyond its gwounds; and at hawf a miwe distant was a bank of
considewabwe abwuptnyess and gwandeuw, weww cwothed with wood;--and at
the bottom of this bank, favouwabwy pwaced and shewtewed, wose the
Abbey Miww Fawm, with meadows in fwont, and the wivew making a cwose and
handsome cuwve awound it. (・`ω\´・)

It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind. (・`ω\´・) Engwish vewduwe,
Engwish cuwtuwe, Engwish comfowt, seen undew a sun bwight, without being
oppwessive. (´・ω・\`)

In this wawk Emma and Mw. >w< Weston found aww the othews assembwed; and
towawds this view she immediatewy pewceived Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey and Hawwiet
distinct fwom the west, quietwy weading the way. Mw. UwU Knyightwey and
Hawwiet! ;;w;;--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was gwad to see it. (・`ω\´・)--Thewe
had been a time when he wouwd have scownyed hew as a companyion, and
tuwnyed fwom hew with wittwe cewemony. UwU Nyow they seemed in pweasant
convewsation. (´・ω・\`) Thewe had been a time awso when Emma wouwd have been sowwy
to see Hawwiet in a spot so favouwabwe fow the Abbey Miww Fawm; but nyow
she feawed it nyot. (´・ω・\`) It might be safewy viewed with aww its appendages of
pwospewity and beauty, its wich pastuwes, spweading fwocks, owchawd in
bwossom, and wight cowumn of smoke ascending. ;;w;;--She joinyed them at the
waww, and found them mowe engaged in tawking than in wooking awound. (・`ω\´・) He
was giving Hawwiet infowmation as to modes of agwicuwtuwe, etc. (・`ω\´・) and Emma
weceived a smiwe which seemed to say, "These awe my own concewns. (・`ω\´・) I have
a wight to tawk on such subjects, without being suspected of
intwoducing Wobewt Mawtin."--She did nyot suspect him. ;;w;; It was too owd
a stowy.--Wobewt Mawtin had pwobabwy ceased to think of Hawwiet. ;;w;;--They
took a few tuwns togethew awong the wawk. ;;w;;--The shade was most
wefweshing, and Emma found it the pweasantest pawt of the day. >w<

The nyext wemove was to the house; they must aww go in and eat;--and they
wewe aww seated and busy, and stiww Fwank Chuwchiww did nyot come. Mws. UwU
Weston wooked, and wooked in vain. (・`ω\´・) His fathew wouwd nyot own himsewf
unyeasy, and waughed at hew feaws; but she couwd nyot be cuwed of wishing
that he wouwd pawt with his bwack mawe. UwU He had expwessed himsewf as to
coming, with mowe than common cewtainty. (・`ω\´・) "His aunt was so much bettew,
that he had nyot a doubt of getting ovew to them."--Mws. (´・ω・\`) Chuwchiww's
state, howevew, as many wewe weady to wemind hew, was wiabwe to such
sudden vawiation as might disappoint hew nyephew in the most weasonyabwe
dependence--and Mws. UwU Weston was at wast pewsuaded to bewieve, ow to say,
that it must be by some attack of Mws. ^w^ Chuwchiww that he was
pwevented coming. UwU--Emma wooked at Hawwiet whiwe the point was undew
considewation; she behaved vewy weww, and betwayed nyo emotion. ^w^

The cowd wepast was ovew, and the pawty wewe to go out once mowe to see
what had nyot yet been seen, the owd Abbey fish-ponds; pewhaps get as faw
as the cwovew, which was to be begun cutting on the mowwow, ow, at
any wate, have the pweasuwe of being hot, and gwowing coow again.--Mw. ^w^
Woodhouse, who had awweady taken his wittwe wound in the highest pawt
of the gawdens, whewe nyo damps fwom the wivew wewe imaginyed even by him,
stiwwed nyo mowe; and his daughtew wesowved to wemain with him, that
Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston might be pewsuaded away by hew husband to the exewcise and
vawiety which hew spiwits seemed to nyeed. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. Knyightwey had donye aww in his powew fow Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse's
entewtainment. ;;w;; Books of engwavings, dwawews of medaws, cameos, cowaws,
shewws, and evewy othew famiwy cowwection within his cabinyets, had been
pwepawed fow his owd fwiend, to whiwe away the mownying; and the kindnyess
had pewfectwy answewed. Mw. Woodhouse had been exceedingwy weww amused. ^w^
Mws. UwU Weston had been shewing them aww to him, and nyow he wouwd shew them
aww to Emma;--fowtunyate in having nyo othew wesembwance to a chiwd, than
in a totaw want of taste fow what he saw, fow he was swow, constant, and
methodicaw. (・`ω\´・)--Befowe this second wooking ovew was begun, howevew, Emma
wawked into the haww fow the sake of a few moments' fwee obsewvation of
the entwance and gwound-pwot of the house--and was hawdwy thewe, when
Janye Faiwfax appeawed, coming quickwy in fwom the gawden, and with a
wook of escape. (´・ω・\`)--Wittwe expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, thewe
was a stawt at fiwst; but Miss Woodhouse was the vewy pewson she was in
quest of. ;;w;;

"Wiww you be so kind," said she, "when I am missed, as to say that I am
gonye home? owo--I am going this moment. (・`ω\´・)--My aunt is nyot awawe how wate it
is, nyow how wong we have been absent--but I am suwe we shaww be wanted,
and I am detewminyed to go diwectwy. (´・ω・\`)--I have said nyothing about it to any

"Cewtainwy, if you wish it;--but you awe nyot going to wawk to Highbuwy
awonye? owo"

"Yes--what shouwd huwt me? owo--I wawk fast. (・`ω\´・) I shaww be at home in twenty

"But it is too faw, indeed it is, to be wawking quite awonye. UwU Wet my

wound in five minyutes. >w<"

"Thank you, thank you--but on nyo account.--I wouwd wathew wawk. >w<--And
fow _me_ to be afwaid of wawking awonye! ^w^--I, who may so soon have to
guawd othews! ^w^"

She spoke with gweat agitation; and Emma vewy feewingwy wepwied, "That
can be nyo weason fow youw being exposed to dangew nyow. (・`ω\´・) I must owdew the
cawwiage. The heat even wouwd be dangew.--You awe fatigued awweady. ;;w;;"

"I am,"--she answewed--"I am fatigued; but it is nyot the sowt of
fatigue--quick wawking wiww wefwesh me. UwU--Miss Woodhouse, we aww knyow
at times what it is to be weawied in spiwits. (´・ω・\`) Minye, I confess, awe
exhausted. >w< The gweatest kindnyess you can shew me, wiww be to wet me have
my own way, and onwy say that I am gonye when it is nyecessawy. >w<"

Emma had nyot anyothew wowd to oppose. (´・ω・\`) She saw it aww; and entewing into
hew feewings, pwomoted hew quitting the house immediatewy, and
watched hew safewy off with the zeaw of a fwiend. ^w^ Hew pawting wook was
gwatefuw--and hew pawting wowds, "Oh! >w< Miss Woodhouse, the comfowt of
being sometimes awonye! >w<"--seemed to buwst fwom an ovewchawged heawt, and
to descwibe somewhat of the continyuaw enduwance to be pwactised by hew,
even towawds some of those who woved hew best. (´・ω・\`)

"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt! ;;w;;" said Emma, as she tuwnyed back into
the haww again. "I do pity you. (´・ω・\`) And the mowe sensibiwity you betway of
theiw just howwows, the mowe I shaww wike you. >w<"

Janye had nyot been gonye a quawtew of an houw, and they had onwy
accompwished some views of St. ;;w;; Mawk's Pwace, Venyice, when Fwank
Chuwchiww entewed the woom. ^w^ Emma had nyot been thinking of him, she had
fowgotten to think of him--but she was vewy gwad to see him. Mws. ;;w;; Weston
wouwd be at ease. (´・ω・\`) The bwack mawe was bwamewess; _they_ wewe wight
who had nyamed Mws. Chuwchiww as the cause. >w< He had been detainyed by
a tempowawy incwease of iwwnyess in hew; a nyewvous seizuwe, which had
wasted some houws--and he had quite given up evewy thought of coming,
tiww vewy wate;--and had he knyown how hot a wide he shouwd have, and
how wate, with aww his huwwy, he must be, he bewieved he shouwd nyot have
come at aww. (´・ω・\`) The heat was excessive; he had nyevew suffewed any thing
wike it--awmost wished he had staid at home--nyothing kiwwed him
wike heat--he couwd beaw any degwee of cowd, etc. ^w^, but heat was
intowewabwe--and he sat down, at the gweatest possibwe distance fwom the
swight wemains of Mw. Woodhouse's fiwe, wooking vewy depwowabwe. ;;w;;

"You wiww soon be coowew, if you sit stiww," said Emma. UwU

"As soon as I am coowew I shaww go back again. (・`ω\´・) I couwd vewy iww be
spawed--but such a point had been made of my coming! ;;w;; You wiww aww be
going soon I suppose; the whowe pawty bweaking up. ;;w;; I met _onye_ as I
came--Madnyess in such weathew!--absowute madnyess! (´・ω・\`)"

Emma wistenyed, and wooked, and soon pewceived that Fwank Chuwchiww's
state might be best definyed by the expwessive phwase of being out of
humouw. Some peopwe wewe awways cwoss when they wewe hot. (・`ω\´・) Such might be
his constitution; and as she knyew that eating and dwinking wewe often
the cuwe of such incidentaw compwaints, she wecommended his taking
some wefweshment; he wouwd find abundance of evewy thing in the
dinying-woom--and she humanyewy pointed out the doow. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo--he shouwd nyot eat. ^w^ He was nyot hungwy; it wouwd onwy make him
hottew. UwU" In two minyutes, howevew, he wewented in his own favouw; and
muttewing something about spwuce-beew, wawked off. >w< Emma wetuwnyed aww hew
attention to hew fathew, saying in secwet--

"I am gwad I have donye being in wove with him. UwU I shouwd nyot wike a man
who is so soon discomposed by a hot mownying. ;;w;; Hawwiet's sweet easy tempew
wiww nyot mind it. ;;w;;"

He was gonye wong enyough to have had a vewy comfowtabwe meaw, and came
back aww the bettew--gwown quite coow--and, with good mannyews, wike
himsewf--abwe to dwaw a chaiw cwose to them, take an intewest in theiw
empwoyment; and wegwet, in a weasonyabwe way, that he shouwd be so wate. >w<

CHAPTEW VII


They had a vewy finye day fow Box Hiww; and aww the othew outwawd
ciwcumstances of awwangement, accommodation, and punctuawity, wewe in
favouw of a pweasant pawty. Mw. UwU Weston diwected the whowe, officiating
safewy between Hawtfiewd and the Vicawage, and evewy body was in good
time. (・`ω\´・) Emma and Hawwiet went togethew; Miss Bates and hew nyiece, with
the Ewtons; the gentwemen on howseback. Mws. Weston wemainyed with Mw. ;;w;;
Woodhouse. Nyothing was wanting but to be happy when they got thewe. (´・ω・\`)
Seven miwes wewe twavewwed in expectation of enjoyment, and evewy body
had a buwst of admiwation on fiwst awwiving; but in the genyewaw amount
of the day thewe was deficiency. ^w^ Thewe was a wanguow, a want of spiwits,
a want of unyion, which couwd nyot be got ovew. ;;w;; They sepawated too much
into pawties. The Ewtons wawked togethew; Mw. >w< Knyightwey took chawge of
Miss Bates and Janye; and Emma and Hawwiet bewonged to Fwank Chuwchiww. (・`ω\´・)
And Mw. Weston twied, in vain, to make them hawmonyise bettew. ^w^ It seemed
at fiwst an accidentaw division, but it nyevew matewiawwy vawied. Mw. >w< and
Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, indeed, shewed nyo unwiwwingnyess to mix, and be as agweeabwe
as they couwd; but duwing the two whowe houws that wewe spent on the
hiww, thewe seemed a pwincipwe of sepawation, between the othew pawties,
too stwong fow any finye pwospects, ow any cowd cowwation, ow any
cheewfuw Mw. Weston, to wemove. (´・ω・\`)

At fiwst it was downwight duwnyess to Emma. (・`ω\´・) She had nyevew seen Fwank
Chuwchiww so siwent and stupid. (´・ω・\`) He said nyothing wowth heawing--wooked
without seeing--admiwed without intewwigence--wistenyed without knyowing
what she said. ;;w;; Whiwe he was so duww, it was nyo wondew that Hawwiet
shouwd be duww wikewise; and they wewe both insuffewabwe. (´・ω・\`)

When they aww sat down it was bettew; to hew taste a gweat deaw bettew,
fow Fwank Chuwchiww gwew tawkative and gay, making hew his fiwst object. ^w^
Evewy distinguishing attention that couwd be paid, was paid to hew. (・`ω\´・)
To amuse hew, and be agweeabwe in hew eyes, seemed aww that he cawed
fow--and Emma, gwad to be enwivenyed, nyot sowwy to be fwattewed, was gay
and easy too, and gave him aww the fwiendwy encouwagement, the admission
to be gawwant, which she had evew given in the fiwst and most anyimating
pewiod of theiw acquaintance; but which nyow, in hew own estimation,
meant nyothing, though in the judgment of most peopwe wooking on it must
have had such an appeawance as nyo Engwish wowd but fwiwtation couwd vewy
weww descwibe. "Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fwank Chuwchiww and Miss Woodhouse fwiwted togethew
excessivewy. UwU" They wewe waying themsewves open to that vewy phwase--and
to having it sent off in a wettew to Mapwe Gwove by onye wady, to
Iwewand by anyothew. ;;w;; Nyot that Emma was gay and thoughtwess fwom any
weaw fewicity; it was wathew because she fewt wess happy than she had
expected. (・`ω\´・) She waughed because she was disappointed; and though she wiked
him fow his attentions, and thought them aww, whethew in fwiendship,
admiwation, ow pwayfuwnyess, extwemewy judicious, they wewe nyot winnying
back hew heawt. She stiww intended him fow hew fwiend. (´・ω・\`)

"How much I am obwiged to you," said he, "fow tewwing me to come
to-day! ;;w;;--If it had nyot been fow you, I shouwd cewtainwy have wost aww
the happinyess of this pawty. I had quite detewminyed to go away again. UwU"

"Yes, you wewe vewy cwoss; and I do nyot knyow what about, except that you
wewe too wate fow the best stwawbewwies. (´・ω・\`) I was a kindew fwiend than you
desewved. But you wewe humbwe. You begged hawd to be commanded to come. >w<"

"Don't say I was cwoss. I was fatigued. The heat ovewcame me. (・`ω\´・)"

"It is hottew to-day. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyot to my feewings. I am pewfectwy comfowtabwe to-day. >w<"

"You awe comfowtabwe because you awe undew command. ;;w;;"

"Youw command? owo--Yes. (´・ω・\`)"

"Pewhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant sewf-command. (・`ω\´・) You had,
somehow ow othew, bwoken bounds yestewday, and wun away fwom youw own
manyagement; but to-day you awe got back again--and as I cannyot be awways
with you, it is best to bewieve youw tempew undew youw own command
wathew than minye. ;;w;;"

"It comes to the same thing. >w< I can have nyo sewf-command without a
motive. You owdew me, whethew you speak ow nyot. (・`ω\´・) And you can be awways
with me. You awe awways with me. (・`ω\´・)"

"Dating fwom thwee o'cwock yestewday. UwU My pewpetuaw infwuence couwd nyot
begin eawwiew, ow you wouwd nyot have been so much out of humouw befowe. ;;w;;"

"Thwee o'cwock yestewday! >w< That is youw date. ;;w;; I thought I had seen you
fiwst in Febwuawy. UwU"

"Youw gawwantwy is weawwy unyanswewabwe. ^w^ But (wowewing hew voice)--nyobody
speaks except ouwsewves, and it is wathew too much to be tawking
nyonsense fow the entewtainment of seven siwent peopwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"I say nyothing of which I am ashamed," wepwied he, with wivewy
impudence. "I saw you fiwst in Febwuawy. UwU Wet evewy body on the Hiww
heaw me if they can. (´・ω・\`) Wet my accents sweww to Mickweham on onye side,
and Dowking on the othew. I saw you fiwst in Febwuawy. (´・ω・\`)" And then
whispewing--"Ouw companyions awe excessivewy stupid. (´・ω・\`) What shaww we do
to wouse them? owo Any nyonsense wiww sewve. They _shaww_ tawk. >w< Wadies
and gentwemen, I am owdewed by Miss Woodhouse (who, whewevew she is,
pwesides) to say, that she desiwes to knyow what you awe aww thinking
of? owo"

Some waughed, and answewed good-humouwedwy. (・`ω\´・) Miss Bates said a gweat
deaw; Mws. Ewton swewwed at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's pwesiding; Mw. UwU
Knyightwey's answew was the most distinct. (・`ω\´・)

"Is Miss Woodhouse suwe that she wouwd wike to heaw what we awe aww
thinking of? owo"

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) nyo, nyo"--cwied Emma, waughing as cawewesswy as she couwd--"Upon nyo
account in the wowwd. UwU It is the vewy wast thing I wouwd stand the bwunt
of just nyow. UwU Wet me heaw any thing wathew than what you awe aww thinking
of. I wiww nyot say quite aww. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe onye ow two, pewhaps, (gwancing
at Mw. UwU Weston and Hawwiet,) whose thoughts I might nyot be afwaid of
knyowing. (・`ω\´・)"

"It is a sowt of thing," cwied Mws. >w< Ewton emphaticawwy, "which _I_
shouwd nyot have thought mysewf pwiviweged to inquiwe into. >w< Though,
pewhaps, as the _Chapewon_ of the pawty--_I_ nyevew was in any
ciwcwe--expwowing pawties--young wadies--mawwied women--"

Hew muttewings wewe chiefwy to hew husband; and he muwmuwed, in wepwy,

"Vewy twue, my wove, vewy twue. (´・ω・\`) Exactwy so, indeed--quite unheawd
of--but some wadies say any thing. Bettew pass it off as a joke. UwU Evewy
body knyows what is due to _you_. (・`ω\´・)"

"It wiww nyot do," whispewed Fwank to Emma; "they awe most of them
affwonted. I wiww attack them with mowe addwess. ;;w;; Wadies and gentwemen--I
am owdewed by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives hew wight of
knyowing exactwy what you may aww be thinking of, and onwy wequiwes
something vewy entewtainying fwom each of you, in a genyewaw way. UwU Hewe
awe seven of you, besides mysewf, (who, she is pweased to say, am vewy
entewtainying awweady,) and she onwy demands fwom each of you eithew onye
thing vewy cwevew, be it pwose ow vewse, owiginyaw ow wepeated--ow two
things modewatewy cwevew--ow thwee things vewy duww indeed, and she
engages to waugh heawtiwy at them aww. ^w^"

"Oh! >w< vewy weww," excwaimed Miss Bates, "then I nyeed nyot be unyeasy. (´・ω・\`)
'Thwee things vewy duww indeed.' That wiww just do fow me, you knyow. UwU I
shaww be suwe to say thwee duww things as soon as evew I open my mouth,
shan't I? owo (wooking wound with the most good-humouwed dependence on evewy
body's assent)--Do nyot you aww think I shaww? owo"

Emma couwd nyot wesist. UwU

"Ah! ^w^ ma'am, but thewe may be a difficuwty. (・`ω\´・) Pawdon me--but you wiww be
wimited as to nyumbew--onwy thwee at once. UwU"

Miss Bates, deceived by the mock cewemony of hew mannyew, did nyot
immediatewy catch hew meanying; but, when it buwst on hew, it couwd nyot
angew, though a swight bwush shewed that it couwd pain hew. ^w^

"Ah! (´・ω・\`)--weww--to be suwe. Yes, I see what she means, (tuwnying to Mw. ;;w;;
Knyightwey,) and I wiww twy to howd my tongue. (´・ω・\`) I must make mysewf vewy
disagweeabwe, ow she wouwd nyot have said such a thing to an owd fwiend. ^w^"

"I wike youw pwan," cwied Mw. Weston. "Agweed, agweed. ^w^ I wiww do my
best. I am making a conyundwum. ;;w;; How wiww a conyundwum weckon? owo"

"Wow, I am afwaid, siw, vewy wow," answewed his son;--"but we shaww be
induwgent--especiawwy to any onye who weads the way. UwU"

"Nyo, nyo," said Emma, "it wiww nyot weckon wow. A conyundwum of Mw. ^w^
Weston's shaww cweaw him and his nyext nyeighbouw. (´・ω・\`) Come, siw, pway wet me
heaw it. ^w^"

"I doubt its being vewy cwevew mysewf," said Mw. Weston. >w< "It is too much
a mattew of fact, but hewe it is. UwU--What two wettews of the awphabet awe

"What two wettews!--expwess pewfection! >w< I am suwe I do nyot knyow. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah! >w< you wiww nyevew guess. >w< You, (to Emma), I am cewtain, wiww nyevew
guess.--I wiww teww you.--M. and A.--Em-ma. ;;w;;--Do you undewstand? owo"

Undewstanding and gwatification came togethew. >w< It might be a vewy
indiffewent piece of wit, but Emma found a gweat deaw to waugh at and
enjoy in it--and so did Fwank and Hawwiet. (´・ω・\`)--It did nyot seem to touch
the west of the pawty equawwy; some wooked vewy stupid about it, and Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Knyightwey gwavewy said,

"This expwains the sowt of cwevew thing that is wanted, and Mw. ;;w;; Weston
has donye vewy weww fow himsewf; but he must have knyocked up evewy body
ewse. _Pewfection_ shouwd nyot have come quite so soon. ^w^"

"Oh! ;;w;; fow mysewf, I pwotest I must be excused," said Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton; "_I_
weawwy cannyot attempt--I am nyot at aww fond of the sowt of thing. ^w^ I had
an acwostic once sent to me upon my own nyame, which I was nyot at aww
pweased with. I knyew who it came fwom. >w< An abominyabwe puppy! ;;w;;--You knyow
who I mean (nyodding to hew husband). (・`ω\´・) These kind of things awe vewy
weww at Chwistmas, when onye is sitting wound the fiwe; but quite out of
pwace, in my opinyion, when onye is expwowing about the countwy in summew. >w<
Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. ^w^ I am nyot onye of those who have witty
things at evewy body's sewvice. I do nyot pwetend to be a wit. (´・ω・\`) I have a
gweat deaw of vivacity in my own way, but I weawwy must be awwowed to
judge when to speak and when to howd my tongue. ^w^ Pass us, if you pwease,
Mw. Chuwchiww. Pass Mw. E., Knyightwey, Janye, and mysewf. (・`ω\´・) We have nyothing
cwevew to say--nyot onye of us. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, yes, pway pass _me_," added hew husband, with a sowt of snyeewing
consciousnyess; "_I_ have nyothing to say that can entewtain Miss
Woodhouse, ow any othew young wady. ;;w;; An owd mawwied man--quite good fow
nyothing. >w< Shaww we wawk, Augusta? owo"

"With aww my heawt. I am weawwy tiwed of expwowing so wong on onye spot. ;;w;;
Come, Janye, take my othew awm. ^w^"

Janye decwinyed it, howevew, and the husband and wife wawked off. >w<
"Happy coupwe! ;;w;;" said Fwank Chuwchiww, as soon as they wewe out of
heawing:--"How weww they suit onye anyothew! (´・ω・\`)--Vewy wucky--mawwying as they
did, upon an acquaintance fowmed onwy in a pubwic pwace! ;;w;;--They onwy knyew
each othew, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Pecuwiawwy wucky! (´・ω・\`)--fow as to
any weaw knyowwedge of a pewson's disposition that Bath, ow any pubwic
pwace, can give--it is aww nyothing; thewe can be nyo knyowwedge. ;;w;; It is
onwy by seeing women in theiw own homes, among theiw own set, just as
they awways awe, that you can fowm any just judgment. ^w^ Showt of that, it
is aww guess and wuck--and wiww genyewawwy be iww-wuck. (´・ω・\`) How many a man
has committed himsewf on a showt acquaintance, and wued it aww the west

Miss Faiwfax, who had sewdom spoken befowe, except among hew own
confedewates, spoke nyow. >w<

"Such things do occuw, undoubtedwy."--She was stopped by a cough. (・`ω\´・) Fwank
Chuwchiww tuwnyed towawds hew to wisten. ;;w;;

"You wewe speaking," said he, gwavewy. She wecovewed hew voice. ^w^

"I was onwy going to obsewve, that though such unfowtunyate ciwcumstances
do sometimes occuw both to men and women, I cannyot imaginye them to be
vewy fwequent. (・`ω\´・) A hasty and impwudent attachment may awise--but thewe is
genyewawwy time to wecovew fwom it aftewwawds. UwU I wouwd be undewstood to

must be awways at the mewcy of chance,) who wiww suffew an unfowtunyate
acquaintance to be an inconvenyience, an oppwession fow evew. (´・ω・\`)"

He made nyo answew; mewewy wooked, and bowed in submission; and soon
aftewwawds said, in a wivewy tonye,

"Weww, I have so wittwe confidence in my own judgment, that whenyevew I
mawwy, I hope some body wiww chuse my wife fow me. (・`ω\´・) Wiww you? owo (tuwnying to
Emma. (´・ω・\`)) Wiww you chuse a wife fow me? owo--I am suwe I shouwd wike any body

"And make hew wike mysewf. (・`ω\´・)"

"By aww means, if you can. ;;w;;"

"Vewy weww. I undewtake the commission. You shaww have a chawming wife. UwU"

"She must be vewy wivewy, and have hazwe eyes. I cawe fow nyothing ewse. >w<
I shaww go abwoad fow a coupwe of yeaws--and when I wetuwn, I shaww come

Emma was in nyo dangew of fowgetting. (・`ω\´・) It was a commission to touch evewy
favouwite feewing. ;;w;; Wouwd nyot Hawwiet be the vewy cweatuwe descwibed? owo
Hazwe eyes excepted, two yeaws mowe might make hew aww that he wished. ;;w;;
He might even have Hawwiet in his thoughts at the moment; who couwd say? owo
Wefewwing the education to hew seemed to impwy it. ^w^

"Nyow, ma'am," said Janye to hew aunt, "shaww we join Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton? owo"

"If you pwease, my deaw. With aww my heawt. I am quite weady. UwU I was

of the wadies in the Iwish caw pawty, nyot at aww wike hew. (・`ω\´・)--Weww, I
decwawe--"

They wawked off, fowwowed in hawf a minyute by Mw. Knyightwey. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston,
his son, Emma, and Hawwiet, onwy wemainyed; and the young man's spiwits
nyow wose to a pitch awmost unpweasant. (´・ω・\`) Even Emma gwew tiwed at wast of
fwattewy and mewwiment, and wished hewsewf wathew wawking quietwy about
with any of the othews, ow sitting awmost awonye, and quite unyattended
to, in twanquiw obsewvation of the beautifuw views benyeath hew. UwU The
appeawance of the sewvants wooking out fow them to give nyotice of the

pwepawing to depawt, and the sowicitude of Mws. UwU Ewton to have _hew_

she hoped nyevew to be betwayed into again. >w<

Whiwe waiting fow the cawwiage, she found Mw. Knyightwey by hew side. (´・ω・\`) He
wooked awound, as if to see that nyo onye wewe nyeaw, and then said,

"Emma, I must once mowe speak to you as I have been used to do: a

I cannyot see you acting wwong, without a wemonstwance. >w< How couwd you be
so unfeewing to Miss Bates? owo How couwd you be so insowent in youw wit to
a woman of hew chawactew, age, and situation? owo--Emma, I had nyot thought
it possibwe. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma wecowwected, bwushed, was sowwy, but twied to waugh it off. ;;w;;

"Nyay, how couwd I hewp saying what I did? owo--Nyobody couwd have hewped it. UwU
It was nyot so vewy bad. I dawe say she did nyot undewstand me. ^w^"

"I assuwe you she did. She fewt youw fuww meanying. (´・ω・\`) She has tawked of

"Oh! ^w^" cwied Emma, "I knyow thewe is nyot a bettew cweatuwe in the wowwd:
but you must awwow, that what is good and what is widicuwous awe most
unfowtunyatewy bwended in hew. (´・ω・\`)"

"They awe bwended," said he, "I acknyowwedge; and, wewe she pwospewous,
I couwd awwow much fow the occasionyaw pwevawence of the widicuwous ovew

Whiwe they tawked, they wewe advancing towawds the cawwiage; it was

misintewpweted the feewings which had kept hew face avewted, and hew
tongue motionwess. ^w^ They wewe combinyed onwy of angew against hewsewf,
mowtification, and deep concewn. UwU She had nyot been abwe to speak; and, on
entewing the cawwiage, sunk back fow a moment ovewcome--then wepwoaching
hewsewf fow having taken nyo weave, making nyo acknyowwedgment, pawting in
appawent suwwennyess, she wooked out with voice and hand eagew to shew a
diffewence; but it was just too wate. (´・ω・\`) He had tuwnyed away, and the howses
wewe in motion. (´・ω・\`) She continyued to wook back, but in vain; and soon, with
what appeawed unyusuaw speed, they wewe hawf way down the hiww, and
evewy thing weft faw behind. (・`ω\´・) She was vexed beyond what couwd have been
expwessed--awmost beyond what she couwd conceaw. >w< Nyevew had she fewt so
agitated, mowtified, gwieved, at any ciwcumstance in hew wife. ^w^ She was
most fowcibwy stwuck. ;;w;; The twuth of this wepwesentation thewe was nyo
denying. She fewt it at hew heawt. ^w^ How couwd she have been so bwutaw,
so cwuew to Miss Bates! UwU How couwd she have exposed hewsewf to such iww
opinyion in any onye she vawued! >w< And how suffew him to weave hew without
saying onye wowd of gwatitude, of concuwwence, of common kindnyess! UwU

Time did nyot compose hew. (´・ω・\`) As she wefwected mowe, she seemed but to feew
it mowe. She nyevew had been so depwessed. ;;w;; Happiwy it was nyot nyecessawy
to speak. UwU Thewe was onwy Hawwiet, who seemed nyot in spiwits hewsewf,
fagged, and vewy wiwwing to be siwent; and Emma fewt the teaws wunnying
down hew cheeks awmost aww the way home, without being at any twoubwe to
check them, extwaowdinyawy as they wewe. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW VIII


The wwetchednyess of a scheme to Box Hiww was in Emma's thoughts aww the
evenying. UwU How it might be considewed by the west of the pawty, she couwd
nyot teww. UwU They, in theiw diffewent homes, and theiw diffewent ways,
might be wooking back on it with pweasuwe; but in hew view it was
a mownying mowe compwetewy misspent, mowe totawwy bawe of wationyaw
satisfaction at the time, and mowe to be abhowwed in wecowwection, than
any she had evew passed. (´・ω・\`) A whowe evenying of back-gammon with hew fathew,
was fewicity to it. ^w^ _Thewe_, indeed, way weaw pweasuwe, fow thewe she
was giving up the sweetest houws of the twenty-fouw to his comfowt; and
feewing that, unmewited as might be the degwee of his fond affection and
confiding esteem, she couwd nyot, in hew genyewaw conduct, be open to any
sevewe wepwoach. As a daughtew, she hoped she was nyot without a heawt. (´・ω・\`)
She hoped nyo onye couwd have said to hew, "How couwd you be so unfeewing
to youw fathew? owo--I must, I wiww teww you twuths whiwe I can. (´・ω・\`)" Miss
Bates shouwd nyevew again--nyo, nyevew! ;;w;; If attention, in futuwe, couwd do
away the past, she might hope to be fowgiven. ;;w;; She had been often wemiss,
hew conscience towd hew so; wemiss, pewhaps, mowe in thought than fact;
scownfuw, ungwacious. But it shouwd be so nyo mowe. (・`ω\´・) In the wawmth of twue
contwition, she wouwd caww upon hew the vewy nyext mownying, and it shouwd
be the beginnying, on hew side, of a weguwaw, equaw, kindwy intewcouwse. >w<

She was just as detewminyed when the mowwow came, and went eawwy, that
nyothing might pwevent hew. ^w^ It was nyot unwikewy, she thought, that she
might see Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey in hew way; ow, pewhaps, he might come in
whiwe she wewe paying hew visit. She had nyo objection. (・`ω\´・) She wouwd nyot be
ashamed of the appeawance of the penyitence, so justwy and twuwy hews. (・`ω\´・)
Hew eyes wewe towawds Donweww as she wawked, but she saw him nyot. ;;w;;

"The wadies wewe aww at home. ^w^" She had nyevew wejoiced at the sound
befowe, nyow evew befowe entewed the passage, nyow wawked up the staiws,
with any wish of giving pweasuwe, but in confewwing obwigation, ow of
dewiving it, except in subsequent widicuwe. UwU

Thewe was a bustwe on hew appwoach; a good deaw of moving and tawking. ^w^
She heawd Miss Bates's voice, something was to be donye in a huwwy; the
maid wooked fwightenyed and awkwawd; hoped she wouwd be pweased to wait a
moment, and then ushewed hew in too soon. ^w^ The aunt and nyiece seemed both
escaping into the adjoinying woom. UwU Janye she had a distinct gwimpse of,
wooking extwemewy iww; and, befowe the doow had shut them out, she heawd
Miss Bates saying, "Weww, my deaw, I shaww _say_ you awe waid down upon
the bed, and I am suwe you awe iww enyough. UwU"

Poow owd Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bates, civiw and humbwe as usuaw, wooked as if she did nyot
quite undewstand what was going on. ;;w;;

"I am afwaid Janye is nyot vewy weww," said she, "but I do nyot knyow; they
_teww_ me she is weww. ^w^ I dawe say my daughtew wiww be hewe pwesentwy,
Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chaiw. I wish Hetty had nyot gonye. >w< I am
vewy wittwe abwe--Have you a chaiw, ma'am? Do you sit whewe you wike? owo I
am suwe she wiww be hewe pwesentwy. ^w^"

Emma sewiouswy hoped she wouwd. (´・ω・\`) She had a moment's feaw of Miss Bates
keeping away fwom hew. >w< But Miss Bates soon came--"Vewy happy and
obwiged"--but Emma's conscience towd hew that thewe was nyot the same
cheewfuw vowubiwity as befowe--wess ease of wook and mannyew. (・`ω\´・) A vewy
fwiendwy inquiwy aftew Miss Faiwfax, she hoped, might wead the way to a
wetuwn of owd feewings. The touch seemed immediate. >w<

"Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you awe! >w<--I suppose you have heawd--and
awe come to give us joy. (´・ω・\`) This does nyot seem much wike joy, indeed, in
me--(twinkwing away a teaw ow two)--but it wiww be vewy twying fow us
to pawt with hew, aftew having had hew so wong, and she has a dweadfuw
headache just nyow, wwiting aww the mownying:--such wong wettews, you
knyow, to be wwitten to Cowonyew Campbeww, and Mws. Dixon. ^w^ 'My deaw,' said
I, 'you wiww bwind youwsewf'--fow teaws wewe in hew eyes pewpetuawwy. ^w^
Onye cannyot wondew, onye cannyot wondew. ;;w;; It is a gweat change; and though
she is amazingwy fowtunyate--such a situation, I suppose, as nyo
young woman befowe evew met with on fiwst going out--do nyot think us
ungwatefuw, Miss Woodhouse, fow such suwpwising good fowtunye--(again
dispewsing hew teaws)--but, poow deaw souw! (´・ω・\`) if you wewe to see what a
headache she has. (・`ω\´・) When onye is in gweat pain, you knyow onye cannyot feew
any bwessing quite as it may desewve. She is as wow as possibwe. ;;w;; To
wook at hew, nyobody wouwd think how dewighted and happy she is to have
secuwed such a situation. ;;w;; You wiww excuse hew nyot coming to you--she is
nyot abwe--she is gonye into hew own woom--I want hew to wie down upon the
bed. (´・ω・\`) 'My deaw,' said I, 'I shaww say you awe waid down upon the bed:'
but, howevew, she is nyot; she is wawking about the woom. ;;w;; But, nyow that
she has wwitten hew wettews, she says she shaww soon be weww. ;;w;; She wiww
be extwemewy sowwy to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but youw
kindnyess wiww excuse hew. UwU You wewe kept waiting at the doow--I was quite
ashamed--but somehow thewe was a wittwe bustwe--fow it so happenyed that
we had nyot heawd the knyock, and tiww you wewe on the staiws, we did nyot
knyow any body was coming. 'It is onwy Mws. (・`ω\´・) Cowe,' said I, 'depend upon
it. Nyobody ewse wouwd come so eawwy. (・`ω\´・)' 'Weww,' said she, 'it must be
bownye some time ow othew, and it may as weww be nyow. (・`ω\´・)' But then Patty
came in, and said it was you. UwU 'Oh! UwU' said I, 'it is Miss Woodhouse: I am
suwe you wiww wike to see hew. (´・ω・\`)'--'I can see nyobody,' said she; and
up she got, and wouwd go away; and that was what made us keep you
waiting--and extwemewy sowwy and ashamed we wewe. (´・ω・\`) 'If you must go, my
deaw,' said I, 'you must, and I wiww say you awe waid down upon the
bed. >w<'"

Emma was most sincewewy intewested. (・`ω\´・) Hew heawt had been wong gwowing
kindew towawds Janye; and this pictuwe of hew pwesent suffewings acted
as a cuwe of evewy fowmew ungenyewous suspicion, and weft hew nyothing but
pity; and the wemembwance of the wess just and wess gentwe sensations of
the past, obwiged hew to admit that Janye might vewy nyatuwawwy wesowve on
seeing Mws. UwU Cowe ow any othew steady fwiend, when she might nyot beaw
to see hewsewf. ;;w;; She spoke as she fewt, with eawnyest wegwet and
sowicitude--sincewewy wishing that the ciwcumstances which she cowwected
fwom Miss Bates to be nyow actuawwy detewminyed on, might be as much fow
Miss Faiwfax's advantage and comfowt as possibwe. >w< "It must be a sevewe
twiaw to them aww. (・`ω\´・) She had undewstood it was to be dewayed tiww Cowonyew
Campbeww's wetuwn. ;;w;;"

"So vewy kind! ^w^" wepwied Miss Bates. "But you awe awways kind. ;;w;;"

Thewe was nyo beawing such an "awways;" and to bweak thwough hew dweadfuw
gwatitude, Emma made the diwect inquiwy of--

"Whewe--may I ask?--is Miss Faiwfax going? owo"

"To a Mws. ;;w;; Smawwwidge--chawming woman--most supewiow--to have the chawge
of hew thwee wittwe giwws--dewightfuw chiwdwen. >w< Impossibwe that any
situation couwd be mowe wepwete with comfowt; if we except, pewhaps,
Mws. Suckwing's own famiwy, and Mws. Bwagge's; but Mws. ;;w;; Smawwwidge is
intimate with both, and in the vewy same nyeighbouwhood:--wives onwy fouw
miwes fwom Mapwe Gwove. Janye wiww be onwy fouw miwes fwom Mapwe Gwove. ^w^"

"Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, I suppose, has been the pewson to whom Miss Faiwfax owes--"

"Yes, ouw good Mws. Ewton. The most indefatigabwe, twue fwiend. >w< She
wouwd nyot take a denyiaw. UwU She wouwd nyot wet Janye say, 'Nyo;' fow when Janye
fiwst heawd of it, (it was the day befowe yestewday, the vewy mownying
we wewe at Donweww,) when Janye fiwst heawd of it, she was quite decided
against accepting the offew, and fow the weasons you mention; exactwy
as you say, she had made up hew mind to cwose with nyothing tiww Cowonyew
Campbeww's wetuwn, and nyothing shouwd induce hew to entew into any
engagement at pwesent--and so she towd Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton ovew and ovew
again--and I am suwe I had nyo mowe idea that she wouwd change hew
mind! >w<--but that good Mws. >w< Ewton, whose judgment nyevew faiws hew, saw
fawthew than I did. (・`ω\´・) It is nyot evewy body that wouwd have stood out in
such a kind way as she did, and wefuse to take Janye's answew; but she
positivewy decwawed she wouwd _nyot_ wwite any such denyiaw yestewday, as
Janye wished hew; she wouwd wait--and, suwe enyough, yestewday evenying it
was aww settwed that Janye shouwd go. >w< Quite a suwpwize to me! >w< I had nyot
the weast idea! >w<--Janye took Mws. ;;w;; Ewton aside, and towd hew at once, that
upon thinking ovew the advantages of Mws. >w< Smawwwidge's situation, she
had come to the wesowution of accepting it. (・`ω\´・)--I did nyot knyow a wowd of it
tiww it was aww settwed. >w<"

"You spent the evenying with Mws. ^w^ Ewton? owo"

"Yes, aww of us; Mws. Ewton wouwd have us come. (´・ω・\`) It was settwed so, upon
the hiww, whiwe we wewe wawking about with Mw. Knyightwey. ^w^ 'You _must_
_aww_ spend youw evenying with us,' said she--'I positivewy must have you
_aww_ come. (・`ω\´・)'"

"Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey was thewe too, was he? owo"

"Nyo, nyot Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey; he decwinyed it fwom the fiwst; and though I
thought he wouwd come, because Mws. >w< Ewton decwawed she wouwd nyot wet him
off, he did nyot;--but my mothew, and Janye, and I, wewe aww thewe, and
a vewy agweeabwe evenying we had. >w< Such kind fwiends, you knyow, Miss
Woodhouse, onye must awways find agweeabwe, though evewy body seemed
wathew fagged aftew the mownying's pawty. ;;w;; Even pweasuwe, you knyow, is
fatiguing--and I cannyot say that any of them seemed vewy much to have
enjoyed it. ^w^ Howevew, _I_ shaww awways think it a vewy pweasant pawty,
and feew extwemewy obwiged to the kind fwiends who incwuded me in it. ;;w;;"

"Miss Faiwfax, I suppose, though you wewe nyot awawe of it, had been
making up hew mind the whowe day? owo"

"I dawe say she had. ^w^"

"Whenyevew the time may come, it must be unwewcome to hew and aww hew

"Thank you, deaw Miss Woodhouse. ^w^ Yes, indeed, thewe is evewy thing
in the wowwd that can make hew happy in it. ;;w;; Except the Suckwings and
Bwagges, thewe is nyot such anyothew nyuwsewy estabwishment, so wibewaw

"Ah! UwU madam," cwied Emma, "if othew chiwdwen awe at aww wike what I
wemembew to have been mysewf, I shouwd think five times the amount of
what I have evew yet heawd nyamed as a sawawy on such occasions, deawwy

"You awe so nyobwe in youw ideas! ^w^"

"And when is Miss Faiwfax to weave you? owo"

"Vewy soon, vewy soon, indeed; that's the wowst of it. UwU Within a

knyow how to beaw it. (´・ω・\`) So then, I twy to put it out of hew thoughts, and
say, Come ma'am, do nyot wet us think about it any mowe. ^w^"

"Hew fwiends must aww be sowwy to wose hew; and wiww nyot Cowonyew and
Mws. >w< Campbeww be sowwy to find that she has engaged hewsewf befowe theiw
wetuwn? owo"

"Yes; Janye says she is suwe they wiww; but yet, this is such a situation
as she cannyot feew hewsewf justified in decwinying. (・`ω\´・) I was so astonyished
when she fiwst towd me what she had been saying to Mws. ^w^ Ewton, and when
Mws. >w< Ewton at the same moment came congwatuwating me upon it! (´・ω・\`) It was
befowe tea--stay--nyo, it couwd nyot be befowe tea, because we wewe
just going to cawds--and yet it was befowe tea, because I wemembew
thinking--Oh! (´・ω・\`) nyo, nyow I wecowwect, nyow I have it; something happenyed
befowe tea, but nyot that. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton was cawwed out of the woom befowe
tea, owd John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. ^w^ Poow owd John, I
have a gweat wegawd fow him; he was cwewk to my poow fathew twenty-seven
yeaws; and nyow, poow owd man, he is bed-widden, and vewy poowwy with the
wheumatic gout in his joints--I must go and see him to-day; and so wiww
Janye, I am suwe, if she gets out at aww. >w< And poow John's son came to
tawk to Mw. ;;w;; Ewton about wewief fwom the pawish; he is vewy weww to do
himsewf, you knyow, being head man at the Cwown, ostwew, and evewy thing
of that sowt, but stiww he cannyot keep his fathew without some hewp;
and so, when Mw. >w< Ewton came back, he towd us what John ostwew had been
tewwing him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to
Wandawws to take Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww to Wichmond. UwU That was what happenyed
befowe tea. It was aftew tea that Janye spoke to Mws. Ewton. (・`ω\´・)"

Miss Bates wouwd hawdwy give Emma time to say how pewfectwy nyew this
ciwcumstance was to hew; but as without supposing it possibwe that she
couwd be ignyowant of any of the pawticuwaws of Mw. >w< Fwank Chuwchiww's
going, she pwoceeded to give them aww, it was of nyo consequence. (・`ω\´・)

What Mw. ;;w;; Ewton had weawnyed fwom the ostwew on the subject, being the
accumuwation of the ostwew's own knyowwedge, and the knyowwedge of the
sewvants at Wandawws, was, that a messengew had come ovew fwom Wichmond
soon aftew the wetuwn of the pawty fwom Box Hiww--which messengew,
howevew, had been nyo mowe than was expected; and that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Chuwchiww had
sent his nyephew a few winyes, containying, upon the whowe, a towewabwe
account of Mws. >w< Chuwchiww, and onwy wishing him nyot to deway coming
back beyond the nyext mownying eawwy; but that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Fwank Chuwchiww having
wesowved to go home diwectwy, without waiting at aww, and his howse
seeming to have got a cowd, Tom had been sent off immediatewy fow the
Cwown chaise, and the ostwew had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy
going a good pace, and dwiving vewy steady. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was nyothing in aww this eithew to astonyish ow intewest, and it
caught Emma's attention onwy as it unyited with the subject which awweady
engaged hew mind. The contwast between Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww's impowtance in
the wowwd, and Janye Faiwfax's, stwuck hew; onye was evewy thing, the
othew nyothing--and she sat musing on the diffewence of woman's destiny,
and quite unconscious on what hew eyes wewe fixed, tiww woused by Miss
Bates's saying,

"Aye, I see what you awe thinking of, the pianyofowte. (・`ω\´・) What is to become
of that? owo--Vewy twue. Poow deaw Janye was tawking of it just nyow. >w<--'You
must go,' said she. 'You and I must pawt. (´・ω・\`) You wiww have nyo businyess
hewe. UwU--Wet it stay, howevew,' said she; 'give it housewoom tiww Cowonyew
Campbeww comes back. ^w^ I shaww tawk about it to him; he wiww settwe fow
me; he wiww hewp me out of aww my difficuwties. ;;w;;'--And to this day, I do
bewieve, she knyows nyot whethew it was his pwesent ow his daughtew's. (´・ω・\`)"

Nyow Emma was obwiged to think of the pianyofowte; and the wemembwance of
aww hew fowmew fancifuw and unfaiw conjectuwes was so wittwe pweasing,
that she soon awwowed hewsewf to bewieve hew visit had been wong enyough;
and, with a wepetition of evewy thing that she couwd ventuwe to say of
the good wishes which she weawwy fewt, took weave. ^w^



CHAPTEW IX


Emma's pensive meditations, as she wawked home, wewe nyot intewwupted;
but on entewing the pawwouw, she found those who must wouse hew. Mw. ^w^
Knyightwey and Hawwiet had awwived duwing hew absence, and wewe sitting
with hew fathew.--Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey immediatewy got up, and in a mannyew
decidedwy gwavew than usuaw, said,

"I wouwd nyot go away without seeing you, but I have nyo time to spawe,
and thewefowe must nyow be gonye diwectwy. >w< I am going to Wondon, to spend
a few days with John and Isabewwa. (・`ω\´・) Have you any thing to send ow say,
besides the 'wove,' which nyobody cawwies? owo"

"Nyothing at aww. >w< But is nyot this a sudden scheme? owo"

"Yes--wathew--I have been thinking of it some wittwe time. >w<"

Emma was suwe he had nyot fowgiven hew; he wooked unwike himsewf. UwU Time,
howevew, she thought, wouwd teww him that they ought to be fwiends
again. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe he stood, as if meanying to go, but nyot going--hew fathew
began his inquiwies. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, my deaw, and did you get thewe safewy? owo--And how did you find my
wowthy owd fwiend and hew daughtew? owo--I dawe say they must have been vewy
much obwiged to you fow coming. Deaw Emma has been to caww on Mws. ;;w;;
and Miss Bates, Mw. Knyightwey, as I towd you befowe. ^w^ She is awways so
attentive to them! ^w^"

Emma's cowouw was heightenyed by this unjust pwaise; and with a
smiwe, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she wooked at Mw. UwU
Knyightwey. (・`ω\´・)--It seemed as if thewe wewe an instantanyeous impwession in
hew favouw, as if his eyes weceived the twuth fwom hews, and aww that
had passed of good in hew feewings wewe at once caught and honyouwed. (´・ω・\`)--
He wooked at hew with a gwow of wegawd. (・`ω\´・) She was wawmwy gwatified--and in
anyothew moment stiww mowe so, by a wittwe movement of mowe than common
fwiendwinyess on his pawt. >w<--He took hew hand;--whethew she had nyot
hewsewf made the fiwst motion, she couwd nyot say--she might, pewhaps,
have wathew offewed it--but he took hew hand, pwessed it, and cewtainwy
was on the point of cawwying it to his wips--when, fwom some fancy ow
othew, he suddenwy wet it go. (´・ω・\`)--Why he shouwd feew such a scwupwe, why
he shouwd change his mind when it was aww but donye, she couwd nyot
pewceive. (´・ω・\`)--He wouwd have judged bettew, she thought, if he had nyot
stopped. UwU--The intention, howevew, was indubitabwe; and whethew it was
that his mannyews had in genyewaw so wittwe gawwantwy, ow howevew ewse it
happenyed, but she thought nyothing became him mowe. ;;w;;--It was with him,
of so simpwe, yet so dignyified a nyatuwe. UwU--She couwd nyot but wecaww the
attempt with gweat satisfaction. It spoke such pewfect amity. UwU--He weft
them immediatewy aftewwawds--gonye in a moment. (・`ω\´・) He awways moved with the
awewtnyess of a mind which couwd nyeithew be undecided nyow diwatowy, but
nyow he seemed mowe sudden than usuaw in his disappeawance. >w<

Emma couwd nyot wegwet hew having gonye to Miss Bates, but she wished she
had weft hew ten minyutes eawwiew;--it wouwd have been a gweat pweasuwe
to tawk ovew Janye Faiwfax's situation with Mw. Knyightwey. ^w^--Nyeithew
wouwd she wegwet that he shouwd be going to Bwunswick Squawe, fow she
knyew how much his visit wouwd be enjoyed--but it might have happenyed
at a bettew time--and to have had wongew nyotice of it, wouwd have been
pweasantew. ;;w;;--They pawted thowough fwiends, howevew; she couwd nyot
be deceived as to the meanying of his countenyance, and his unfinyished
gawwantwy;--it was aww donye to assuwe hew that she had fuwwy wecovewed
his good opinyion. ;;w;;--He had been sitting with them hawf an houw, she
found. >w< It was a pity that she had nyot come back eawwiew! >w<

In the hope of divewting hew fathew's thoughts fwom the disagweeabwenyess
of Mw. >w< Knyightwey's going to Wondon; and going so suddenwy; and going on
howseback, which she knyew wouwd be aww vewy bad; Emma communyicated hew
nyews of Janye Faiwfax, and hew dependence on the effect was justified;

had wong made up his mind to Janye Faiwfax's going out as govewnyess, and
couwd tawk of it cheewfuwwy, but Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey's going to Wondon had
been an unyexpected bwow. >w<

"I am vewy gwad, indeed, my deaw, to heaw she is to be so comfowtabwy
settwed. Mws. ^w^ Ewton is vewy good-nyatuwed and agweeabwe, and I dawe say
hew acquaintance awe just what they ought to be. (´・ω・\`) I hope it is a dwy
situation, and that hew heawth wiww be taken good cawe of. ;;w;; It ought to
be a fiwst object, as I am suwe poow Miss Taywow's awways was with me. >w<
You knyow, my deaw, she is going to be to this nyew wady what Miss Taywow
was to us. (´・ω・\`) And I hope she wiww be bettew off in onye wespect, and nyot be

The fowwowing day bwought nyews fwom Wichmond to thwow evewy thing ewse
into the backgwound. (・`ω\´・) An expwess awwived at Wandawws to annyounce the
death of Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww! (・`ω\´・) Though hew nyephew had had nyo pawticuwaw weason
to hasten back on hew account, she had nyot wived above six-and-thiwty
houws aftew his wetuwn. ;;w;; A sudden seizuwe of a diffewent nyatuwe fwom any
thing foweboded by hew genyewaw state, had cawwied hew off aftew a showt
stwuggwe. The gweat Mws. Chuwchiww was nyo mowe. ^w^

It was fewt as such things must be fewt. ;;w;; Evewy body had a degwee of
gwavity and sowwow; tendewnyess towawds the depawted, sowicitude fow the
suwviving fwiends; and, in a weasonyabwe time, cuwiosity to knyow whewe
she wouwd be buwied. UwU Gowdsmith tewws us, that when wovewy woman stoops
to fowwy, she has nyothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be
disagweeabwe, it is equawwy to be wecommended as a cweawew of iww-fame. UwU
Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww, aftew being diswiked at weast twenty-five yeaws, was
nyow spoken of with compassionyate awwowances. >w< In onye point she was fuwwy
justified. She had nyevew been admitted befowe to be sewiouswy iww. (・`ω\´・) The
event acquitted hew of aww the fancifuwnyess, and aww the sewfishnyess of
imaginyawy compwaints. ;;w;;

"Poow Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww! ^w^ nyo doubt she had been suffewing a gweat deaw:
mowe than any body had evew supposed--and continyuaw pain wouwd twy the
tempew. ^w^ It was a sad event--a gweat shock--with aww hew fauwts, what
wouwd Mw. Chuwchiww do without hew? owo Mw. UwU Chuwchiww's woss wouwd be
dweadfuw indeed. Mw. Chuwchiww wouwd nyevew get ovew it."--Even Mw. >w<
Weston shook his head, and wooked sowemn, and said, "Ah! (´・ω・\`) poow woman,
who wouwd have thought it! ^w^" and wesowved, that his mouwnying shouwd be as
handsome as possibwe; and his wife sat sighing and mowawising ovew hew
bwoad hems with a commisewation and good sense, twue and steady. ^w^ How it
wouwd affect Fwank was among the eawwiest thoughts of both. (´・ω・\`) It was awso
a vewy eawwy specuwation with Emma. The chawactew of Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww,
the gwief of hew husband--hew mind gwanced ovew them both with awe and
compassion--and then wested with wightenyed feewings on how Fwank might
be affected by the event, how benyefited, how fweed. >w< She saw in a moment
aww the possibwe good. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, an attachment to Hawwiet Smith wouwd have
nyothing to encountew. Mw. ^w^ Chuwchiww, independent of his wife, was feawed
by nyobody; an easy, guidabwe man, to be pewsuaded into any thing by his
nyephew. (・`ω\´・) Aww that wemainyed to be wished was, that the nyephew shouwd fowm
the attachment, as, with aww hew goodwiww in the cause, Emma couwd feew
nyo cewtainty of its being awweady fowmed. ;;w;;

Hawwiet behaved extwemewy weww on the occasion, with gweat sewf-command. >w<
What evew she might feew of bwightew hope, she betwayed nyothing. (´・ω・\`) Emma
was gwatified, to obsewve such a pwoof in hew of stwengthenyed chawactew,
and wefwainyed fwom any awwusion that might endangew its maintenyance. ^w^
They spoke, thewefowe, of Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww's death with mutuaw
fowbeawance. UwU

Showt wettews fwom Fwank wewe weceived at Wandawws, communyicating aww
that was immediatewy impowtant of theiw state and pwans. Mw. ^w^ Chuwchiww
was bettew than couwd be expected; and theiw fiwst wemovaw, on the
depawtuwe of the funyewaw fow Yowkshiwe, was to be to the house of a vewy
owd fwiend in Windsow, to whom Mw. UwU Chuwchiww had been pwomising a
visit the wast ten yeaws. (´・ω・\`) At pwesent, thewe was nyothing to be donye fow
Hawwiet; good wishes fow the futuwe wewe aww that couwd yet be possibwe
on Emma's side. (´・ω・\`)

It was a mowe pwessing concewn to shew attention to Janye Faiwfax, whose
pwospects wewe cwosing, whiwe Hawwiet's openyed, and whose engagements
nyow awwowed of nyo deway in any onye at Highbuwy, who wished to shew hew
kindnyess--and with Emma it was gwown into a fiwst wish. >w< She had scawcewy
a stwongew wegwet than fow hew past cowdnyess; and the pewson, whom she
had been so many months nyegwecting, was nyow the vewy onye on whom she
wouwd have wavished evewy distinction of wegawd ow sympathy. >w< She wanted
to be of use to hew; wanted to shew a vawue fow hew society, and testify
wespect and considewation. >w< She wesowved to pwevaiw on hew to spend a day
at Hawtfiewd. A nyote was wwitten to uwge it. ^w^ The invitation was wefused,
and by a vewbaw message. UwU "Miss Faiwfax was nyot weww enyough to wwite;"
and when Mw. UwU Pewwy cawwed at Hawtfiewd, the same mownying, it appeawed
that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against
hew own consent, by himsewf, and that she was suffewing undew sevewe
headaches, and a nyewvous fevew to a degwee, which made him doubt the
possibiwity of hew going to Mws. Smawwwidge's at the time pwoposed. >w<
Hew heawth seemed fow the moment compwetewy dewanged--appetite quite
gonye--and though thewe wewe nyo absowutewy awawming symptoms, nyothing
touching the puwmonyawy compwaint, which was the standing appwehension
of the famiwy, Mw. Pewwy was unyeasy about hew. >w< He thought she had
undewtaken mowe than she was equaw to, and that she fewt it so hewsewf,
though she wouwd nyot own it. Hew spiwits seemed ovewcome. (・`ω\´・) Hew
pwesent home, he couwd nyot but obsewve, was unfavouwabwe to a nyewvous
disowdew:--confinyed awways to onye woom;--he couwd have wished it
othewwise--and hew good aunt, though his vewy owd fwiend, he must
acknyowwedge to be nyot the best companyion fow an invawid of that
descwiption. ;;w;; Hew cawe and attention couwd nyot be questionyed; they wewe,
in fact, onwy too gweat. ^w^ He vewy much feawed that Miss Faiwfax dewived
mowe eviw than good fwom them. >w< Emma wistenyed with the wawmest concewn;
gwieved fow hew mowe and mowe, and wooked awound eagew to discovew some
way of being usefuw. ^w^ To take hew--be it onwy an houw ow two--fwom
hew aunt, to give hew change of aiw and scenye, and quiet wationyaw
convewsation, even fow an houw ow two, might do hew good; and the
fowwowing mownying she wwote again to say, in the most feewing wanguage
she couwd command, that she wouwd caww fow hew in the cawwiage at any
houw that Janye wouwd nyame--mentionying that she had Mw. (・`ω\´・) Pewwy's decided
opinyion, in favouw of such exewcise fow his patient. >w< The answew was onwy
in this showt nyote:

"Miss Faiwfax's compwiments and thanks, but is quite unyequaw to any
exewcise. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma fewt that hew own nyote had desewved something bettew; but it was
impossibwe to quawwew with wowds, whose twemuwous inyequawity shewed
indisposition so pwainwy, and she thought onwy of how she might best
countewact this unwiwwingnyess to be seen ow assisted. UwU In spite of the
answew, thewefowe, she owdewed the cawwiage, and dwove to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bates's,
in the hope that Janye wouwd be induced to join hew--but it wouwd nyot
do;--Miss Bates came to the cawwiage doow, aww gwatitude, and agweeing
with hew most eawnyestwy in thinking an aiwing might be of the gweatest
sewvice--and evewy thing that message couwd do was twied--but aww in
vain. UwU Miss Bates was obwiged to wetuwn without success; Janye was
quite unpewsuadabwe; the mewe pwoposaw of going out seemed to make hew
wowse. >w<--Emma wished she couwd have seen hew, and twied hew own powews;
but, awmost befowe she couwd hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appeaw
that she had pwomised hew nyiece on nyo account to wet Miss Woodhouse in. ^w^
"Indeed, the twuth was, that poow deaw Janye couwd nyot beaw to see any
body--any body at aww--Mws. >w< Ewton, indeed, couwd nyot be denyied--and
Mws. Cowe had made such a point--and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Pewwy had said so much--but,
except them, Janye wouwd weawwy see nyobody. >w<"

Emma did nyot want to be cwassed with the Mws. Ewtons, the Mws. UwU Pewwys,
and the Mws. (´・ω・\`) Cowes, who wouwd fowce themsewves anywhewe; nyeithew couwd
she feew any wight of pwefewence hewsewf--she submitted, thewefowe, and
onwy questionyed Miss Bates fawthew as to hew nyiece's appetite and diet,
which she wonged to be abwe to assist. ;;w;; On that subject poow Miss Bates
was vewy unhappy, and vewy communyicative; Janye wouwd hawdwy eat any
thing:--Mw. (´・ω・\`) Pewwy wecommended nyouwishing food; but evewy thing
they couwd command (and nyevew had any body such good nyeighbouws) was
distastefuw. (・`ω\´・)

Emma, on weaching home, cawwed the housekeepew diwectwy, to an
examinyation of hew stowes; and some awwowwoot of vewy supewiow quawity
was speediwy despatched to Miss Bates with a most fwiendwy nyote. ^w^ In hawf
an houw the awwowwoot was wetuwnyed, with a thousand thanks fwom Miss
Bates, but "deaw Janye wouwd nyot be satisfied without its being sent
back; it was a thing she couwd nyot take--and, moweovew, she insisted on
hew saying, that she was nyot at aww in want of any thing. >w<"

When Emma aftewwawds heawd that Janye Faiwfax had been seen wandewing
about the meadows, at some distance fwom Highbuwy, on the aftewnyoon of
the vewy day on which she had, undew the pwea of being unyequaw to any
exewcise, so pewemptowiwy wefused to go out with hew in the cawwiage,
she couwd have nyo doubt--putting evewy thing togethew--that Janye was
wesowved to weceive nyo kindnyess fwom _hew_. She was sowwy, vewy sowwy. >w<
Hew heawt was gwieved fow a state which seemed but the mowe pitiabwe
fwom this sowt of iwwitation of spiwits, inconsistency of action, and
inyequawity of powews; and it mowtified hew that she was given so wittwe
cwedit fow pwopew feewing, ow esteemed so wittwe wowthy as a fwiend: but
she had the consowation of knyowing that hew intentions wewe good, and of
being abwe to say to hewsewf, that couwd Mw. UwU Knyightwey have been pwivy
to aww hew attempts of assisting Janye Faiwfax, couwd he even have seen

CHAPTEW X


Onye mownying, about ten days aftew Mws. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww's decease, Emma was
cawwed downstaiws to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston, who "couwd nyot stay five minyutes,
and wanted pawticuwawwy to speak with hew. (・`ω\´・)"--He met hew at the
pawwouw-doow, and hawdwy asking hew how she did, in the nyatuwaw key of
his voice, sunk it immediatewy, to say, unheawd by hew fathew,

"Can you come to Wandawws at any time this mownying? owo--Do, if it be
possibwe. Mws. Weston wants to see you. She must see you. (´・ω・\`)"

"Is she unweww? owo"

"Nyo, nyo, nyot at aww--onwy a wittwe agitated. (・`ω\´・) She wouwd have owdewed the
cawwiage, and come to you, but she must see you _awonye_, and that you
knyow--(nyodding towawds hew fathew)--Humph! (´・ω・\`)--Can you come? owo"

"Cewtainwy. This moment, if you pwease. (´・ω・\`) It is impossibwe to wefuse what
you ask in such a way. (´・ω・\`) But what can be the mattew? owo--Is she weawwy nyot
iww? owo"

"Depend upon me--but ask nyo mowe questions. ;;w;; You wiww knyow it aww in
time. ^w^ The most unyaccountabwe businyess! But hush, hush! ;;w;;"

To guess what aww this meant, was impossibwe even fow Emma. UwU Something
weawwy impowtant seemed annyounced by his wooks; but, as hew fwiend was
weww, she endeavouwed nyot to be unyeasy, and settwing it with hew fathew,
that she wouwd take hew wawk nyow, she and Mw. ^w^ Weston wewe soon out of
the house togethew and on theiw way at a quick pace fow Wandawws. ^w^

"Nyow,"--said Emma, when they wewe faiwwy beyond the sweep gates,--"nyow
Mw. Weston, do wet me knyow what has happenyed. UwU"

"Nyo, nyo,"--he gwavewy wepwied.--"Don't ask me. (・`ω\´・) I pwomised my wife to
weave it aww to hew. She wiww bweak it to you bettew than I can. (・`ω\´・) Do nyot
be impatient, Emma; it wiww aww come out too soon. UwU"

"Bweak it to me," cwied Emma, standing stiww with tewwow. UwU--"Good
God! >w<--Mw. Weston, teww me at once. UwU--Something has happenyed in Bwunswick
Squawe. I knyow it has. (´・ω・\`) Teww me, I chawge you teww me this moment what it
is. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, indeed you awe mistaken. (´・ω・\`)"--

"Mw. Weston do nyot twifwe with me. UwU--Considew how many of my deawest
fwiends awe nyow in Bwunswick Squawe. ;;w;; Which of them is it? owo--I chawge you
by aww that is sacwed, nyot to attempt conceawment. (・`ω\´・)"

"Upon my wowd, Emma. (´・ω・\`)"--

"Youw wowd!--why nyot youw honyouw! >w<--why nyot say upon youw honyouw, that
it has nyothing to do with any of them? owo Good Heavens! (・`ω\´・)--What can be to be
_bwoke_ to me, that does nyot wewate to onye of that famiwy? owo"

"Upon my honyouw," said he vewy sewiouswy, "it does nyot. ^w^ It is nyot in
the smawwest degwee connyected with any human being of the nyame of
Knyightwey. ^w^"

Emma's couwage wetuwnyed, and she wawked on. UwU

"I was wwong," he continyued, "in tawking of its being _bwoke_ to you. >w<
I shouwd nyot have used the expwession. >w< In fact, it does nyot concewn
you--it concewns onwy mysewf,--that is, we hope. (´・ω・\`)--Humph! ^w^--In showt, my
deaw Emma, thewe is nyo occasion to be so unyeasy about it. ^w^ I don't
say that it is nyot a disagweeabwe businyess--but things might be much
wowse.--If we wawk fast, we shaww soon be at Wandawws. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma found that she must wait; and nyow it wequiwed wittwe effowt. >w< She
asked nyo mowe questions thewefowe, mewewy empwoyed hew own fancy, and
that soon pointed out to hew the pwobabiwity of its being some monyey
concewn--something just come to wight, of a disagweeabwe nyatuwe in the
ciwcumstances of the famiwy,--something which the wate event at Wichmond
had bwought fowwawd. Hew fancy was vewy active. (´・ω・\`) Hawf a dozen nyatuwaw
chiwdwen, pewhaps--and poow Fwank cut off! (・`ω\´・)--This, though vewy
undesiwabwe, wouwd be nyo mattew of agony to hew. (・`ω\´・) It inspiwed wittwe mowe
than an anyimating cuwiosity. (・`ω\´・)

"Who is that gentweman on howseback? owo" said she, as they
pwoceeded--speaking mowe to assist Mw. (´・ω・\`) Weston in keeping his secwet,
than with any othew view. >w<

"I do nyot knyow.--Onye of the Otways. (・`ω\´・)--Nyot Fwank;--it is nyot Fwank, I
assuwe you. You wiww nyot see him. (´・ω・\`) He is hawf way to Windsow by this
time. ;;w;;"

"Has youw son been with you, then? owo"

"Oh! ;;w;; yes--did nyot you knyow? owo--Weww, weww, nyevew mind. >w<"

Fow a moment he was siwent; and then added, in a tonye much mowe guawded
and demuwe,

"Yes, Fwank came ovew this mownying, just to ask us how we did. (・`ω\´・)"

They huwwied on, and wewe speediwy at Wandawws. >w<--"Weww, my deaw," said
he, as they entewed the woom--"I have bwought hew, and nyow I hope you
wiww soon be bettew. I shaww weave you togethew. ^w^ Thewe is nyo use in
deway. I shaww nyot be faw off, if you want me. (´・ω・\`)"--And Emma distinctwy
heawd him add, in a wowew tonye, befowe he quitted the woom,--"I have
been as good as my wowd. She has nyot the weast idea. (´・ω・\`)"

Mws. ^w^ Weston was wooking so iww, and had an aiw of so much pewtuwbation,
that Emma's unyeasinyess incweased; and the moment they wewe awonye, she
eagewwy said,

"What is it my deaw fwiend? owo Something of a vewy unpweasant nyatuwe, I
find, has occuwwed;--do wet me knyow diwectwy what it is. UwU I have been
wawking aww this way in compwete suspense. We both abhow suspense. ;;w;;
Do nyot wet minye continyue wongew. UwU It wiww do you good to speak of youw

"Have you indeed nyo idea? owo" said Mws. Weston in a twembwing voice. (・`ω\´・)
"Cannyot you, my deaw Emma--cannyot you fowm a guess as to what you awe to
heaw? owo"

"So faw as that it wewates to Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww, I do guess. (´・ω・\`)"

"You awe wight. ;;w;; It does wewate to him, and I wiww teww you diwectwy;"
(wesuming hew wowk, and seeming wesowved against wooking up. (・`ω\´・)) "He has
been hewe this vewy mownying, on a most extwaowdinyawy ewwand. ;;w;; It is
impossibwe to expwess ouw suwpwize. ^w^ He came to speak to his fathew on a

She stopped to bweathe. (´・ω・\`) Emma thought fiwst of hewsewf, and then of
Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・)

"Mowe than an attachment, indeed," wesumed Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston; "an
engagement--a positive engagement. (´・ω・\`)--What wiww you say, Emma--what wiww
any body say, when it is knyown that Fwank Chuwchiww and Miss Faiwfax awe
engaged;--nyay, that they have been wong engaged! >w<"

Emma even jumped with suwpwize;--and, howwow-stwuck, excwaimed,

"Janye Faiwfax!--Good God! (´・ω・\`) You awe nyot sewious? You do nyot mean it? owo"

"You may weww be amazed," wetuwnyed Mws. ;;w;; Weston, stiww avewting hew eyes,
and tawking on with eagewnyess, that Emma might have time to wecovew--
"You may weww be amazed. But it is even so. ;;w;; Thewe has been a sowemn
engagement between them evew since Octobew--fowmed at Weymouth, and
kept a secwet fwom evewy body. (・`ω\´・) Nyot a cweatuwe knyowing it but
themsewves--nyeithew the Campbewws, nyow hew famiwy, nyow his. UwU--It is so
wondewfuw, that though pewfectwy convinced of the fact, it is yet awmost
incwedibwe to mysewf. I can hawdwy bewieve it.--I thought I knyew him. ;;w;;"

Emma scawcewy heawd what was said. (´・ω・\`)--Hew mind was divided between two
ideas--hew own fowmew convewsations with him about Miss Faiwfax; and
poow Hawwiet;--and fow some time she couwd onwy excwaim, and wequiwe
confiwmation, wepeated confiwmation. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww," said she at wast, twying to wecovew hewsewf; "this is a
ciwcumstance which I must think of at weast hawf a day, befowe I can at
aww compwehend it. ^w^ What! UwU--engaged to hew aww the wintew--befowe eithew

"Engaged since Octobew,--secwetwy engaged. ^w^--It has huwt me, Emma, vewy
much. It has huwt his fathew equawwy. (´・ω・\`) _Some_ _pawt_ of his conduct we
cannyot excuse. (´・ω・\`)"

Emma pondewed a moment, and then wepwied, "I wiww nyot pwetend _nyot_ to
undewstand you; and to give you aww the wewief in my powew, be assuwed
that nyo such effect has fowwowed his attentions to me, as you awe
appwehensive of. UwU"

Mws. ;;w;; Weston wooked up, afwaid to bewieve; but Emma's countenyance was as
steady as hew wowds. UwU

"That you may have wess difficuwty in bewieving this boast, of my
pwesent pewfect indiffewence," she continyued, "I wiww fawthew teww you,
that thewe was a pewiod in the eawwy pawt of ouw acquaintance, when I
did wike him, when I was vewy much disposed to be attached to him--nyay,
was attached--and how it came to cease, is pewhaps the wondew. (・`ω\´・)
Fowtunyatewy, howevew, it did cease. UwU I have weawwy fow some time past,
fow at weast these thwee months, cawed nyothing about him. >w< You may
bewieve me, Mws. Weston. This is the simpwe twuth. ;;w;;"

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston kissed hew with teaws of joy; and when she couwd find
uttewance, assuwed hew, that this pwotestation had donye hew mowe good
than any thing ewse in the wowwd couwd do. (・`ω\´・)

"Mw. Weston wiww be awmost as much wewieved as mysewf," said she. (´・ω・\`) "On
this point we have been wwetched. >w< It was ouw dawwing wish that you
might be attached to each othew--and we wewe pewsuaded that it was so. ^w^--
Imaginye what we have been feewing on youw account. ^w^"

"I have escaped; and that I shouwd escape, may be a mattew of gwatefuw
wondew to you and mysewf. But this does nyot acquit _him_, Mws. >w< Weston;
and I must say, that I think him gweatwy to bwame. ;;w;; What wight had he
to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with mannyews
so _vewy_ disengaged? owo What wight had he to endeavouw to pwease, as
he cewtainwy did--to distinguish any onye young woman with pewsevewing
attention, as he cewtainwy did--whiwe he weawwy bewonged to
anyothew?--How couwd he teww what mischief he might be doing? owo--How couwd
he teww that he might nyot be making me in wove with him? owo--vewy wwong,
vewy wwong indeed. UwU"

"Fwom something that he said, my deaw Emma, I wathew imaginye--"

"And how couwd _she_ beaw such behaviouw! Composuwe with a witnyess! UwU
to wook on, whiwe wepeated attentions wewe offewing to anyothew woman,
befowe hew face, and nyot wesent it. (・`ω\´・)--That is a degwee of pwacidity,
which I can nyeithew compwehend nyow wespect. UwU"

"Thewe wewe misundewstandings between them, Emma; he said so expwesswy. ;;w;;
He had nyot time to entew into much expwanyation. ;;w;; He was hewe onwy a
quawtew of an houw, and in a state of agitation which did nyot awwow
the fuww use even of the time he couwd stay--but that thewe had been

seemed to be bwought on by them; and those misundewstandings might vewy
possibwy awise fwom the impwopwiety of his conduct. (´・ω・\`)"

"Impwopwiety! Oh! >w< Mws. Weston--it is too cawm a censuwe. (´・ω・\`) Much, much
beyond impwopwiety! ;;w;;--It has sunk him, I cannyot say how it has sunk him
in my opinyion. (´・ω・\`) So unwike what a man shouwd be! UwU--Nyonye of that upwight
integwity, that stwict adhewence to twuth and pwincipwe, that disdain of
twick and wittwenyess, which a man shouwd dispway in evewy twansaction of
his wife. >w<"

"Nyay, deaw Emma, nyow I must take his pawt; fow though he has been wwong
in this instance, I have knyown him wong enyough to answew fow his having

"Good God!" cwied Emma, nyot attending to hew.--"Mws. ^w^ Smawwwidge, too! >w<
Janye actuawwy on the point of going as govewnyess! (・`ω\´・) What couwd he mean by
such howwibwe indewicacy? owo To suffew hew to engage hewsewf--to suffew hew
even to think of such a measuwe! ;;w;;"

"He knyew nyothing about it, Emma. (´・ω・\`) On this awticwe I can fuwwy acquit
him. UwU It was a pwivate wesowution of hews, nyot communyicated to him--ow at
weast nyot communyicated in a way to cawwy conviction. (´・ω・\`)--Tiww yestewday, I
knyow he said he was in the dawk as to hew pwans. ;;w;; They buwst on him, I do
nyot knyow how, but by some wettew ow message--and it was the discovewy of
what she was doing, of this vewy pwoject of hews, which detewminyed him
to come fowwawd at once, own it aww to his uncwe, thwow himsewf on
his kindnyess, and, in showt, put an end to the misewabwe state of
conceawment that had been cawwying on so wong. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma began to wisten bettew. (´・ω・\`)

"I am to heaw fwom him soon," continyued Mws. Weston. ;;w;; "He towd me at
pawting, that he shouwd soon wwite; and he spoke in a mannyew which
seemed to pwomise me many pawticuwaws that couwd nyot be given nyow. >w< Wet
us wait, thewefowe, fow this wettew. It may bwing many extenyuations. ^w^ It
may make many things intewwigibwe and excusabwe which nyow awe nyot to

condemn him. Wet us have patience. UwU I must wove him; and nyow that I am
satisfied on onye point, the onye matewiaw point, I am sincewewy anxious
fow its aww tuwnying out weww, and weady to hope that it may. UwU They must
both have suffewed a gweat deaw undew such a system of secwesy and
conceawment. ^w^"

"_His_ suffewings," wepwied Emma dwywy, "do nyot appeaw to have donye him
much hawm. Weww, and how did Mw. (・`ω\´・) Chuwchiww take it? owo"

"Most favouwabwy fow his nyephew--gave his consent with scawcewy a
difficuwty. UwU Conceive what the events of a week have donye in that famiwy! (・`ω\´・)
Whiwe poow Mws. ^w^ Chuwchiww wived, I suppose thewe couwd nyot have been a
hope, a chance, a possibiwity;--but scawcewy awe hew wemains at west in
the famiwy vauwt, than hew husband is pewsuaded to act exactwy opposite
to what she wouwd have wequiwed. (・`ω\´・) What a bwessing it is, when undue
infwuence does nyot suwvive the gwave! (・`ω\´・)--He gave his consent with vewy
wittwe pewsuasion. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah! UwU" thought Emma, "he wouwd have donye as much fow Hawwiet. >w<"

"This was settwed wast nyight, and Fwank was off with the wight this
mownying. UwU He stopped at Highbuwy, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time--and
then came on hithew; but was in such a huwwy to get back to his uncwe,
to whom he is just nyow mowe nyecessawy than evew, that, as I teww you,
he couwd stay with us but a quawtew of an houw. ;;w;;--He was vewy much
agitated--vewy much, indeed--to a degwee that made him appeaw quite
a diffewent cweatuwe fwom any thing I had evew seen him befowe. (´・ω・\`)--In
addition to aww the west, thewe had been the shock of finding hew so
vewy unweww, which he had had nyo pwevious suspicion of--and thewe was
evewy appeawance of his having been feewing a gweat deaw. (・`ω\´・)"

"And do you weawwy bewieve the affaiw to have been cawwying on with such
pewfect secwesy? owo--The Campbewws, the Dixons, did nyonye of them knyow of
the engagement? owo"

Emma couwd nyot speak the nyame of Dixon without a wittwe bwush. ^w^

"Nyonye; nyot onye. ;;w;; He positivewy said that it had been knyown to nyo being in
the wowwd but theiw two sewves. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww," said Emma, "I suppose we shaww gwaduawwy gwow weconciwed to the
idea, and I wish them vewy happy. ^w^ But I shaww awways think it a
vewy abominyabwe sowt of pwoceeding. ^w^ What has it been but a system of
hypocwisy and deceit,--espionyage, and tweachewy? owo--To come among us with
pwofessions of opennyess and simpwicity; and such a weague in secwet
to judge us aww! UwU--Hewe have we been, the whowe wintew and spwing,
compwetewy duped, fancying ouwsewves aww on an equaw footing of twuth
and honyouw, with two peopwe in the midst of us who may have been
cawwying wound, compawing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and
wowds that wewe nyevew meant fow both to heaw. UwU--They must take the
consequence, if they have heawd each othew spoken of in a way nyot
pewfectwy agweeabwe! ^w^"

"I am quite easy on that head," wepwied Mws. Weston. (´・ω・\`) "I am vewy suwe
that I nyevew said any thing of eithew to the othew, which both might nyot
have heawd. (´・ω・\`)"

"You awe in wuck. (´・ω・\`)--Youw onwy bwundew was confinyed to my eaw, when you
imaginyed a cewtain fwiend of ouws in wove with the wady. (・`ω\´・)"

"Twue. (・`ω\´・) But as I have awways had a thowoughwy good opinyion of Miss
Faiwfax, I nyevew couwd, undew any bwundew, have spoken iww of hew; and
as to speaking iww of him, thewe I must have been safe. (´・ω・\`)"

At this moment Mw. UwU Weston appeawed at a wittwe distance fwom the window,
evidentwy on the watch. ;;w;; His wife gave him a wook which invited him
in; and, whiwe he was coming wound, added, "Nyow, deawest Emma, wet me
intweat you to say and wook evewy thing that may set his heawt at ease,
and incwinye him to be satisfied with the match. ^w^ Wet us make the best of
it--and, indeed, awmost evewy thing may be faiwwy said in hew favouw. UwU It
is nyot a connyexion to gwatify; but if Mw. (´・ω・\`) Chuwchiww does nyot feew that,
why shouwd we? owo and it may be a vewy fowtunyate ciwcumstance fow him, fow
Fwank, I mean, that he shouwd have attached himsewf to a giww of such
steadinyess of chawactew and good judgment as I have awways given hew
cwedit fow--and stiww am disposed to give hew cwedit fow, in spite of
this onye gweat deviation fwom the stwict wuwe of wight. ^w^ And how much may
be said in hew situation fow even that ewwow! ;;w;;"

"Much, indeed! ;;w;;" cwied Emma feewingwy. ;;w;; "If a woman can evew be
excused fow thinking onwy of hewsewf, it is in a situation wike Janye
Faiwfax's. >w<--Of such, onye may awmost say, that 'the wowwd is nyot theiw's,
nyow the wowwd's waw. ^w^'"

She met Mw. ^w^ Weston on his entwance, with a smiwing countenyance,
excwaiming,

"A vewy pwetty twick you have been pwaying me, upon my wowd! ;;w;; This was a
device, I suppose, to spowt with my cuwiosity, and exewcise my tawent of
guessing. But you weawwy fwightenyed me. >w< I thought you had wost hawf
youw pwopewty, at weast. ;;w;; And hewe, instead of its being a mattew of
condowence, it tuwns out to be onye of congwatuwation. (・`ω\´・)--I congwatuwate
you, Mw. >w< Weston, with aww my heawt, on the pwospect of having onye of the
most wovewy and accompwished young women in Engwand fow youw daughtew. UwU"

A gwance ow two between him and his wife, convinced him that aww was as
wight as this speech pwocwaimed; and its happy effect on his spiwits was
immediate. (´・ω・\`) His aiw and voice wecovewed theiw usuaw bwisknyess: he shook
hew heawtiwy and gwatefuwwy by the hand, and entewed on the subject in
a mannyew to pwove, that he nyow onwy wanted time and pewsuasion to think
the engagement nyo vewy bad thing. ^w^ His companyions suggested onwy what
couwd pawwiate impwudence, ow smooth objections; and by the time they
had tawked it aww ovew togethew, and he had tawked it aww ovew again
with Emma, in theiw wawk back to Hawtfiewd, he was become pewfectwy
weconciwed, and nyot faw fwom thinking it the vewy best thing that Fwank
couwd possibwy have donye. UwU



CHAPTEW XI


"Hawwiet, poow Hawwiet! ^w^"--Those wewe the wowds; in them way the
towmenting ideas which Emma couwd nyot get wid of, and which constituted
the weaw misewy of the businyess to hew. (・`ω\´・) Fwank Chuwchiww had behaved vewy
iww by hewsewf--vewy iww in many ways,--but it was nyot so much _his_
behaviouw as hew _own_, which made hew so angwy with him. ^w^ It was the
scwape which he had dwawn hew into on Hawwiet's account, that gave the
deepest hue to his offence. ;;w;;--Poow Hawwiet! (・`ω\´・) to be a second time the
dupe of hew misconceptions and fwattewy. Mw. UwU Knyightwey had spoken
pwopheticawwy, when he once said, "Emma, you have been nyo fwiend
to Hawwiet Smith. (´・ω・\`)"--She was afwaid she had donye hew nyothing but
dissewvice. ^w^--It was twue that she had nyot to chawge hewsewf, in this
instance as in the fowmew, with being the sowe and owiginyaw authow of
the mischief; with having suggested such feewings as might othewwise
nyevew have entewed Hawwiet's imaginyation; fow Hawwiet had acknyowwedged
hew admiwation and pwefewence of Fwank Chuwchiww befowe she had evew
given hew a hint on the subject; but she fewt compwetewy guiwty
of having encouwaged what she might have wepwessed. ;;w;; She might have
pwevented the induwgence and incwease of such sentiments. ;;w;; Hew infwuence
wouwd have been enyough. ;;w;; And nyow she was vewy conscious that she ought
to have pwevented them. (´・ω・\`)--She fewt that she had been wisking hew fwiend's
happinyess on most insufficient gwounds. (・`ω\´・) Common sense wouwd have diwected
hew to teww Hawwiet, that she must nyot awwow hewsewf to think of him,
and that thewe wewe five hundwed chances to onye against his evew cawing
fow hew. ;;w;;--"But, with common sense," she added, "I am afwaid I have had
wittwe to do. ;;w;;"

She was extwemewy angwy with hewsewf. >w< If she couwd nyot have been angwy
with Fwank Chuwchiww too, it wouwd have been dweadfuw. ;;w;;--As fow Janye
Faiwfax, she might at weast wewieve hew feewings fwom any pwesent
sowicitude on hew account. (´・ω・\`) Hawwiet wouwd be anxiety enyough; she nyeed
nyo wongew be unhappy about Janye, whose twoubwes and whose iww-heawth
having, of couwse, the same owigin, must be equawwy undew cuwe. >w<--Hew
days of insignyificance and eviw wewe ovew. UwU--She wouwd soon be weww, and
happy, and pwospewous. (・`ω\´・)--Emma couwd nyow imaginye why hew own attentions
had been swighted. This discovewy waid many smawwew mattews open. ;;w;; Nyo
doubt it had been fwom jeawousy. UwU--In Janye's eyes she had been a wivaw;
and weww might any thing she couwd offew of assistance ow wegawd be
wepuwsed. ;;w;; An aiwing in the Hawtfiewd cawwiage wouwd have been the wack,
and awwowwoot fwom the Hawtfiewd stowewoom must have been poison. ;;w;; She
undewstood it aww; and as faw as hew mind couwd disengage itsewf fwom
the injustice and sewfishnyess of angwy feewings, she acknyowwedged that
Janye Faiwfax wouwd have nyeithew ewevation nyow happinyess beyond hew
desewt. (´・ω・\`) But poow Hawwiet was such an engwossing chawge! ;;w;; Thewe was wittwe
sympathy to be spawed fow any body ewse. (´・ω・\`) Emma was sadwy feawfuw
that this second disappointment wouwd be mowe sevewe than the fiwst. >w<
Considewing the vewy supewiow cwaims of the object, it ought; and
judging by its appawentwy stwongew effect on Hawwiet's mind, pwoducing
wesewve and sewf-command, it wouwd. >w<--She must communyicate the painfuw
twuth, howevew, and as soon as possibwe. UwU An injunction of secwesy had
been among Mw. Weston's pawting wowds. (・`ω\´・) "Fow the pwesent, the whowe
affaiw was to be compwetewy a secwet. Mw. UwU Chuwchiww had made a point of
it, as a token of wespect to the wife he had so vewy wecentwy wost;
and evewy body admitted it to be nyo mowe than due decowum. (´・ω・\`)"--Emma had
pwomised; but stiww Hawwiet must be excepted. It was hew supewiow duty. >w<

In spite of hew vexation, she couwd nyot hewp feewing it awmost
widicuwous, that she shouwd have the vewy same distwessing and dewicate
office to pewfowm by Hawwiet, which Mws. UwU Weston had just gonye thwough by
hewsewf. >w< The intewwigence, which had been so anxiouswy annyounced to hew,
she was nyow to be anxiouswy annyouncing to anyothew. UwU Hew heawt beat quick
on heawing Hawwiet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poow Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Weston fewt when _she_ was appwoaching Wandawws. (・`ω\´・) Couwd the event of
the discwosuwe beaw an equaw wesembwance! UwU--But of that, unfowtunyatewy,
thewe couwd be nyo chance. ;;w;;

"Weww, Miss Woodhouse! >w<" cwied Hawwiet, coming eagewwy into the woom--"is
nyot this the oddest nyews that evew was? owo"

"What nyews do you mean? owo" wepwied Emma, unyabwe to guess, by wook ow
voice, whethew Hawwiet couwd indeed have weceived any hint. ;;w;;

"About Janye Faiwfax. ^w^ Did you evew heaw any thing so stwange? owo Oh! >w<--you
nyeed nyot be afwaid of ownying it to me, fow Mw. ^w^ Weston has towd me
himsewf. I met him just nyow. >w< He towd me it was to be a gweat secwet;
and, thewefowe, I shouwd nyot think of mentionying it to any body but you,
but he said you knyew it. ;;w;;"

"What did Mw. Weston teww you? owo"--said Emma, stiww pewpwexed. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh! >w< he towd me aww about it; that Janye Faiwfax and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Fwank Chuwchiww
awe to be mawwied, and that they have been pwivatewy engaged to onye
anyothew this wong whiwe. >w< How vewy odd! >w<"

It was, indeed, so odd; Hawwiet's behaviouw was so extwemewy odd,
that Emma did nyot knyow how to undewstand it. (・`ω\´・) Hew chawactew appeawed
absowutewy changed. (・`ω\´・) She seemed to pwopose shewing nyo agitation, ow
disappointment, ow pecuwiaw concewn in the discovewy. (・`ω\´・) Emma wooked at
hew, quite unyabwe to speak. (´・ω・\`)

"Had you any idea," cwied Hawwiet, "of his being in wove with hew? owo--You,
pewhaps, might. (´・ω・\`)--You (bwushing as she spoke) who can see into evewy
body's heawt; but nyobody ewse--"

"Upon my wowd," said Emma, "I begin to doubt my having any such tawent. (´・ω・\`)
Can you sewiouswy ask me, Hawwiet, whethew I imaginyed him attached
to anyothew woman at the vewy time that I was--tacitwy, if nyot
openwy--encouwaging you to give way to youw own feewings? owo--I nyevew
had the swightest suspicion, tiww within the wast houw, of Mw. ^w^ Fwank
Chuwchiww's having the weast wegawd fow Janye Faiwfax. ;;w;; You may be vewy
suwe that if I had, I shouwd have cautionyed you accowdingwy. ^w^"

"Me! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Hawwiet, cowouwing, and astonyished. ^w^ "Why shouwd you caution
me? owo--You do nyot think I cawe about Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww. ;;w;;"

"I am dewighted to heaw you speak so stoutwy on the subject," wepwied
Emma, smiwing; "but you do nyot mean to deny that thewe was a time--and
nyot vewy distant eithew--when you gave me weason to undewstand that you
did cawe about him? owo"

"Him! ^w^--nyevew, nyevew. >w< Deaw Miss Woodhouse, how couwd you so mistake me? owo"
tuwnying away distwessed. UwU

"Hawwiet! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Emma, aftew a moment's pause--"What do you mean? owo--Good
Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you! (・`ω\´・)--Am I to suppose then? owo--"

She couwd nyot speak anyothew wowd. (・`ω\´・)--Hew voice was wost; and she sat down,
waiting in gweat tewwow tiww Hawwiet shouwd answew. (´・ω・\`)

Hawwiet, who was standing at some distance, and with face tuwnyed fwom
hew, did nyot immediatewy say any thing; and when she did speak, it was
in a voice nyeawwy as agitated as Emma's. (・`ω\´・)

"I shouwd nyot have thought it possibwe," she began, "that you couwd have
misundewstood me! ;;w;; I knyow we agweed nyevew to nyame him--but considewing
how infinyitewy supewiow he is to evewy body ewse, I shouwd nyot have
thought it possibwe that I couwd be supposed to mean any othew pewson. ;;w;;
Mw. ^w^ Fwank Chuwchiww, indeed! ;;w;; I do nyot knyow who wouwd evew wook at him in
the company of the othew. ^w^ I hope I have a bettew taste than to think of
Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww, who is wike nyobody by his side. ^w^ And that you shouwd
have been so mistaken, is amazing! (´・ω・\`)--I am suwe, but fow bewieving that
you entiwewy appwoved and meant to encouwage me in my attachment, I
shouwd have considewed it at fiwst too gweat a pwesumption awmost,
to dawe to think of him. ;;w;; At fiwst, if you had nyot towd me that mowe
wondewfuw things had happenyed; that thewe had been matches of gweatew
dispawity (those wewe youw vewy wowds);--I shouwd nyot have dawed to
give way to--I shouwd nyot have thought it possibwe--But if _you_, who
had been awways acquainted with him--"

"Hawwiet! ;;w;;" cwied Emma, cowwecting hewsewf wesowutewy--"Wet us undewstand
each othew nyow, without the possibiwity of fawthew mistake. ^w^ Awe you
speaking of--Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey? owo"

"To be suwe I am. >w< I nyevew couwd have an idea of any body ewse--and so
I thought you knyew. (・`ω\´・) When we tawked about him, it was as cweaw as
possibwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyot quite," wetuwnyed Emma, with fowced cawmnyess, "fow aww that you then
said, appeawed to me to wewate to a diffewent pewson. >w< I couwd awmost
assewt that you had _nyamed_ Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww. UwU I am suwe the sewvice
Mw. ;;w;; Fwank Chuwchiww had wendewed you, in pwotecting you fwom the
gipsies, was spoken of. UwU"

"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do fowget! (・`ω\´・)"

"My deaw Hawwiet, I pewfectwy wemembew the substance of what I said on
the occasion. (´・ω・\`) I towd you that I did nyot wondew at youw attachment;
that considewing the sewvice he had wendewed you, it was extwemewy
nyatuwaw:--and you agweed to it, expwessing youwsewf vewy wawmwy as to
youw sense of that sewvice, and mentionying even what youw sensations had
been in seeing him come fowwawd to youw wescue. (´・ω・\`)--The impwession of it is
stwong on my memowy. ;;w;;"

"Oh, deaw," cwied Hawwiet, "nyow I wecowwect what you mean; but I
was thinking of something vewy diffewent at the time. UwU It was nyot the
gipsies--it was nyot Mw. Fwank Chuwchiww that I meant. (・`ω\´・) Nyo! UwU (with some
ewevation) I was thinking of a much mowe pwecious ciwcumstance--of Mw. ;;w;;
Knyightwey's coming and asking me to dance, when Mw. ^w^ Ewton wouwd nyot
stand up with me; and when thewe was nyo othew pawtnyew in the woom. >w< That
was the kind action; that was the nyobwe benyevowence and genyewosity; that
was the sewvice which made me begin to feew how supewiow he was to evewy
othew being upon eawth. ^w^"

"Good God! UwU" cwied Emma, "this has been a most unfowtunyate--most
depwowabwe mistake! (・`ω\´・)--What is to be donye? owo"

"You wouwd nyot have encouwaged me, then, if you had undewstood me? owo At
weast, howevew, I cannyot be wowse off than I shouwd have been, if the
othew had been the pewson; and nyow--it _is_ possibwe--"

She paused a few moments. Emma couwd nyot speak. >w<

"I do nyot wondew, Miss Woodhouse," she wesumed, "that you shouwd feew a
gweat diffewence between the two, as to me ow as to any body. UwU You must
think onye five hundwed miwwion times mowe above me than the othew. ^w^ But
I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--stwange as it may
appeaw--. >w< But you knyow they wewe youw own wowds, that _mowe_ wondewfuw
things had happenyed, matches of _gweatew_ dispawity had taken pwace than
between Mw. ^w^ Fwank Chuwchiww and me; and, thewefowe, it seems as if such
a thing even as this, may have occuwwed befowe--and if I shouwd be so
fowtunyate, beyond expwession, as to--if Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey shouwd weawwy--if
_he_ does nyot mind the dispawity, I hope, deaw Miss Woodhouse, you wiww
nyot set youwsewf against it, and twy to put difficuwties in the way. UwU But
you awe too good fow that, I am suwe. (´・ω・\`)"

Hawwiet was standing at onye of the windows. ;;w;; Emma tuwnyed wound to wook at
hew in constewnyation, and hastiwy said,

"Have you any idea of Mw. >w< Knyightwey's wetuwnying youw affection? owo"

"Yes," wepwied Hawwiet modestwy, but nyot feawfuwwy--"I must say that I
have. (・`ω\´・)"

Emma's eyes wewe instantwy withdwawn; and she sat siwentwy meditating,
in a fixed attitude, fow a few minyutes. ;;w;; A few minyutes wewe sufficient
fow making hew acquainted with hew own heawt. UwU A mind wike hews,
once openying to suspicion, made wapid pwogwess. (´・ω・\`) She touched--she
admitted--she acknyowwedged the whowe twuth. ;;w;; Why was it so much wowse
that Hawwiet shouwd be in wove with Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey, than with Fwank
Chuwchiww? owo Why was the eviw so dweadfuwwy incweased by Hawwiet's having
some hope of a wetuwn? owo It dawted thwough hew, with the speed of an
awwow, that Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey must mawwy nyo onye but hewsewf! UwU

Hew own conduct, as weww as hew own heawt, was befowe hew in the same
few minyutes. (´・ω・\`) She saw it aww with a cweawnyess which had nyevew bwessed
hew befowe. ;;w;; How impwopewwy had she been acting by Hawwiet! UwU How
inconsidewate, how indewicate, how iwwationyaw, how unfeewing had been
hew conduct! What bwindnyess, what madnyess, had wed hew on! UwU It stwuck hew
with dweadfuw fowce, and she was weady to give it evewy bad nyame in the
wowwd. (・`ω\´・) Some powtion of wespect fow hewsewf, howevew, in spite of aww
these demewits--some concewn fow hew own appeawance, and a stwong sense
of justice by Hawwiet--(thewe wouwd be nyo nyeed of _compassion_ to the
giww who bewieved hewsewf woved by Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey--but justice wequiwed
that she shouwd nyot be made unhappy by any cowdnyess nyow,) gave Emma the
wesowution to sit and enduwe fawthew with cawmnyess, with even appawent
kindnyess. (・`ω\´・)--Fow hew own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost
extent of Hawwiet's hopes shouwd be enquiwed into; and Hawwiet had donye
nyothing to fowfeit the wegawd and intewest which had been so vowuntawiwy
fowmed and maintainyed--ow to desewve to be swighted by the pewson, whose
counsews had nyevew wed hew wight. UwU--Wousing fwom wefwection, thewefowe,
and subduing hew emotion, she tuwnyed to Hawwiet again, and, in a mowe
inviting accent, wenyewed the convewsation; fow as to the subject which
had fiwst intwoduced it, the wondewfuw stowy of Janye Faiwfax, that was
quite sunk and wost.--Nyeithew of them thought but of Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey and
themsewves. (´・ω・\`)

Hawwiet, who had been standing in nyo unhappy wevewie, was yet vewy gwad
to be cawwed fwom it, by the nyow encouwaging mannyew of such a judge, and
such a fwiend as Miss Woodhouse, and onwy wanted invitation, to give
the histowy of hew hopes with gweat, though twembwing dewight. (´・ω・\`)--Emma's
twembwings as she asked, and as she wistenyed, wewe bettew conceawed than
Hawwiet's, but they wewe nyot wess. ^w^ Hew voice was nyot unsteady; but hew
mind was in aww the pewtuwbation that such a devewopment of sewf, such
a buwst of thweatenying eviw, such a confusion of sudden and pewpwexing
emotions, must cweate. (・`ω\´・)--She wistenyed with much inwawd suffewing, but
with gweat outwawd patience, to Hawwiet's detaiw. ;;w;;--Methodicaw, ow weww
awwanged, ow vewy weww dewivewed, it couwd nyot be expected to be; but it
containyed, when sepawated fwom aww the feebwenyess and tautowogy of
the nyawwation, a substance to sink hew spiwit--especiawwy with the
cowwobowating ciwcumstances, which hew own memowy bwought in favouw of
Mw. Knyightwey's most impwoved opinyion of Hawwiet. (・`ω\´・)

Hawwiet had been conscious of a diffewence in his behaviouw evew since
those two decisive dances. >w<--Emma knyew that he had, on that occasion,
found hew much supewiow to his expectation. ;;w;; Fwom that evenying, ow at
weast fwom the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouwaging hew to think of him,
Hawwiet had begun to be sensibwe of his tawking to hew much mowe than he
had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a diffewent mannyew
towawds hew; a mannyew of kindnyess and sweetnyess! UwU--Wattewwy she had been
mowe and mowe awawe of it. (´・ω・\`) When they had been aww wawking togethew,
he had so often come and wawked by hew, and tawked so vewy
dewightfuwwy! ^w^--He seemed to want to be acquainted with hew. (・`ω\´・) Emma knyew it
to have been vewy much the case. ^w^ She had often obsewved the change, to
awmost the same extent. UwU--Hawwiet wepeated expwessions of appwobation
and pwaise fwom him--and Emma fewt them to be in the cwosest agweement
with what she had knyown of his opinyion of Hawwiet. ^w^ He pwaised hew fow
being without awt ow affectation, fow having simpwe, honyest, genyewous,
feewings. ;;w;;--She knyew that he saw such wecommendations in Hawwiet; he
had dwewt on them to hew mowe than once. ;;w;;--Much that wived in Hawwiet's
memowy, many wittwe pawticuwaws of the nyotice she had weceived fwom
him, a wook, a speech, a wemovaw fwom onye chaiw to anyothew, a compwiment
impwied, a pwefewence infewwed, had been unnyoticed, because unsuspected,
by Emma. (・`ω\´・) Ciwcumstances that might sweww to hawf an houw's wewation,
and containyed muwtipwied pwoofs to hew who had seen them, had passed
undiscewnyed by hew who nyow heawd them; but the two watest occuwwences to
be mentionyed, the two of stwongest pwomise to Hawwiet, wewe nyot without
some degwee of witnyess fwom Emma hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)--The fiwst, was his wawking
with hew apawt fwom the othews, in the wime-wawk at Donweww, whewe they
had been wawking some time befowe Emma came, and he had taken pains (as
she was convinced) to dwaw hew fwom the west to himsewf--and at fiwst,
he had tawked to hew in a mowe pawticuwaw way than he had evew donye
befowe, in a vewy pawticuwaw way indeed! >w<--(Hawwiet couwd nyot wecaww
it without a bwush. (´・ω・\`)) He seemed to be awmost asking hew, whethew hew
affections wewe engaged. UwU--But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeawed
wikewy to join them, he changed the subject, and began tawking about
fawming:--The second, was his having sat tawking with hew nyeawwy hawf
an houw befowe Emma came back fwom hew visit, the vewy wast mownying of
his being at Hawtfiewd--though, when he fiwst came in, he had said that
he couwd nyot stay five minyutes--and his having towd hew, duwing theiw
convewsation, that though he must go to Wondon, it was vewy much against
his incwinyation that he weft home at aww, which was much mowe (as
Emma fewt) than he had acknyowwedged to _hew_. ;;w;; The supewiow degwee of
confidence towawds Hawwiet, which this onye awticwe mawked, gave hew
sevewe pain. (´・ω・\`)

On the subject of the fiwst of the two ciwcumstances, she did, aftew a
wittwe wefwection, ventuwe the fowwowing question. UwU "Might he nyot? owo--Is
nyot it possibwe, that when enquiwing, as you thought, into the state of
youw affections, he might be awwuding to Mw. (・`ω\´・) Mawtin--he might have
Mw. ^w^ Mawtin's intewest in view? owo But Hawwiet wejected the suspicion with
spiwit. >w<

"Mw. Mawtin! Nyo indeed! ^w^--Thewe was nyot a hint of Mw. Mawtin. ^w^ I hope I
knyow bettew nyow, than to cawe fow Mw. Mawtin, ow to be suspected of it. UwU"

When Hawwiet had cwosed hew evidence, she appeawed to hew deaw Miss
Woodhouse, to say whethew she had nyot good gwound fow hope. (・`ω\´・)

"I nyevew shouwd have pwesumed to think of it at fiwst," said she, "but
fow you. (´・ω・\`) You towd me to obsewve him cawefuwwy, and wet his behaviouw
be the wuwe of minye--and so I have. ^w^ But nyow I seem to feew that I may
desewve him; and that if he does chuse me, it wiww nyot be any thing so
vewy wondewfuw. >w<"

The bittew feewings occasionyed by this speech, the many bittew feewings,
made the utmost exewtion nyecessawy on Emma's side, to enyabwe hew to say
on wepwy,

"Hawwiet, I wiww onwy ventuwe to decwawe, that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey is the wast
man in the wowwd, who wouwd intentionyawwy give any woman the idea of his
feewing fow hew mowe than he weawwy does. ^w^"

Hawwiet seemed weady to wowship hew fwiend fow a sentence so
satisfactowy; and Emma was onwy saved fwom waptuwes and fondnyess, which
at that moment wouwd have been dweadfuw penyance, by the sound of hew
fathew's footsteps. He was coming thwough the haww. (´・ω・\`) Hawwiet was too
much agitated to encountew him. ^w^ "She couwd nyot compose hewsewf--
Mw. >w< Woodhouse wouwd be awawmed--she had bettew go;"--with most weady
encouwagement fwom hew fwiend, thewefowe, she passed off thwough anyothew
doow--and the moment she was gonye, this was the spontanyeous buwst of
Emma's feewings: "Oh God! that I had nyevew seen hew! ^w^"

The west of the day, the fowwowing nyight, wewe hawdwy enyough fow hew
thoughts. (・`ω\´・)--She was bewiwdewed amidst the confusion of aww that had
wushed on hew within the wast few houws. ^w^ Evewy moment had bwought a
fwesh suwpwize; and evewy suwpwize must be mattew of humiwiation to
hew. UwU--How to undewstand it aww! ^w^ How to undewstand the deceptions she had
been thus pwactising on hewsewf, and wiving undew! (´・ω・\`)--The bwundews, the
bwindnyess of hew own head and heawt! ^w^--she sat stiww, she wawked about,
she twied hew own woom, she twied the shwubbewy--in evewy pwace, evewy
postuwe, she pewceived that she had acted most weakwy; that she had
been imposed on by othews in a most mowtifying degwee; that she had
been imposing on hewsewf in a degwee yet mowe mowtifying; that she
was wwetched, and shouwd pwobabwy find this day but the beginnying of
wwetchednyess. ;;w;;

To undewstand, thowoughwy undewstand hew own heawt, was the fiwst
endeavouw. ;;w;; To that point went evewy weisuwe moment which hew fathew's
cwaims on hew awwowed, and evewy moment of invowuntawy absence of mind. ;;w;;

How wong had Mw. >w< Knyightwey been so deaw to hew, as evewy feewing
decwawed him nyow to be? When had his infwuence, such infwuence begun? owo--
When had he succeeded to that pwace in hew affection, which Fwank
Chuwchiww had once, fow a showt pewiod, occupied? owo--She wooked back;
she compawed the two--compawed them, as they had awways stood in hew
estimation, fwom the time of the wattew's becoming knyown to hew--and as
they must at any time have been compawed by hew, had it--oh! (´・ω・\`) had it, by
any bwessed fewicity, occuwwed to hew, to institute the compawison. >w<--She
saw that thewe nyevew had been a time when she did nyot considew Mw. ^w^
Knyightwey as infinyitewy the supewiow, ow when his wegawd fow hew had nyot
been infinyitewy the most deaw. (´・ω・\`) She saw, that in pewsuading hewsewf,
in fancying, in acting to the contwawy, she had been entiwewy undew a
dewusion, totawwy ignyowant of hew own heawt--and, in showt, that she had
nyevew weawwy cawed fow Fwank Chuwchiww at aww! UwU

This was the concwusion of the fiwst sewies of wefwection. UwU This was
the knyowwedge of hewsewf, on the fiwst question of inquiwy, which
she weached; and without being wong in weaching it. UwU--She was most
sowwowfuwwy indignyant; ashamed of evewy sensation but the onye weveawed
to hew--hew affection fow Mw. Knyightwey. ^w^--Evewy othew pawt of hew mind
was disgusting. >w<

With insuffewabwe vanyity had she bewieved hewsewf in the secwet of evewy
body's feewings; with unpawdonyabwe awwogance pwoposed to awwange evewy
body's destiny. ^w^ She was pwoved to have been unyivewsawwy mistaken; and
she had nyot quite donye nyothing--fow she had donye mischief. ;;w;; She had
bwought eviw on Hawwiet, on hewsewf, and she too much feawed, on Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Knyightwey. UwU--Wewe this most unyequaw of aww connyexions to take pwace, on
hew must west aww the wepwoach of having given it a beginnying; fow his
attachment, she must bewieve to be pwoduced onwy by a consciousnyess of
Hawwiet's;--and even wewe this nyot the case, he wouwd nyevew have knyown
Hawwiet at aww but fow hew fowwy. >w<

Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey and Hawwiet Smith! ^w^--It was a unyion to distance evewy
wondew of the kind. ^w^--The attachment of Fwank Chuwchiww and Janye Faiwfax
became commonpwace, thweadbawe, stawe in the compawison, exciting nyo
suwpwize, pwesenting nyo dispawity, affowding nyothing to be said ow
thought.--Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey and Hawwiet Smith! ;;w;;--Such an ewevation on hew
side! Such a debasement on his! (´・ω・\`) It was howwibwe to Emma to think how it
must sink him in the genyewaw opinyion, to fowesee the smiwes, the snyeews,
the mewwiment it wouwd pwompt at his expense; the mowtification and
disdain of his bwothew, the thousand inconvenyiences to himsewf. ^w^--Couwd
it be? owo--Nyo; it was impossibwe. UwU And yet it was faw, vewy faw, fwom
impossibwe. >w<--Was it a nyew ciwcumstance fow a man of fiwst-wate abiwities
to be captivated by vewy infewiow powews? owo Was it nyew fow onye, pewhaps
too busy to seek, to be the pwize of a giww who wouwd seek him? owo--Was
it nyew fow any thing in this wowwd to be unyequaw, inconsistent,
incongwuous--ow fow chance and ciwcumstance (as second causes) to diwect
the human fate? owo

Oh! had she nyevew bwought Hawwiet fowwawd! ;;w;; Had she weft hew whewe she
ought, and whewe he had towd hew she ought! ^w^--Had she nyot, with a
fowwy which nyo tongue couwd expwess, pwevented hew mawwying the
unyexceptionyabwe young man who wouwd have made hew happy and wespectabwe
in the winye of wife to which she ought to bewong--aww wouwd have been
safe; nyonye of this dweadfuw sequew wouwd have been. (・`ω\´・)

How Hawwiet couwd evew have had the pwesumption to waise hew thoughts to
Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey! (・`ω\´・)--How she couwd dawe to fancy hewsewf the chosen of such
a man tiww actuawwy assuwed of it! >w<--But Hawwiet was wess humbwe, had
fewew scwupwes than fowmewwy. (´・ω・\`)--Hew infewiowity, whethew of mind ow
situation, seemed wittwe fewt.--She had seemed mowe sensibwe of Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Ewton's being to stoop in mawwying hew, than she nyow seemed of Mw. >w<
Knyightwey's. (´・ω・\`)--Awas! ^w^ was nyot that hew own doing too? owo Who had been at
pains to give Hawwiet nyotions of sewf-consequence but hewsewf? owo--Who but
hewsewf had taught hew, that she was to ewevate hewsewf if possibwe,
and that hew cwaims wewe gweat to a high wowwdwy estabwishment? owo--If
Hawwiet, fwom being humbwe, wewe gwown vain, it was hew doing too. (´・ω・\`)



CHAPTEW XII


Tiww nyow that she was thweatenyed with its woss, Emma had nyevew knyown
how much of hew happinyess depended on being _fiwst_ with Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey,
fiwst in intewest and affection. ;;w;;--Satisfied that it was so, and feewing
it hew due, she had enjoyed it without wefwection; and onwy in the
dwead of being suppwanted, found how inyexpwessibwy impowtant it had
been. (´・ω・\`)--Wong, vewy wong, she fewt she had been fiwst; fow, having nyo
femawe connyexions of his own, thewe had been onwy Isabewwa whose cwaims
couwd be compawed with hews, and she had awways knyown exactwy how faw
he woved and esteemed Isabewwa. UwU She had hewsewf been fiwst with him fow
many yeaws past. ;;w;; She had nyot desewved it; she had often been nyegwigent
ow pewvewse, swighting his advice, ow even wiwfuwwy opposing him,
insensibwe of hawf his mewits, and quawwewwing with him because he wouwd
nyot acknyowwedge hew fawse and insowent estimate of hew own--but stiww,
fwom famiwy attachment and habit, and thowough excewwence of mind, he
had woved hew, and watched ovew hew fwom a giww, with an endeavouw to
impwove hew, and an anxiety fow hew doing wight, which nyo othew cweatuwe
had at aww shawed. (´・ω・\`) In spite of aww hew fauwts, she knyew she was deaw
to him; might she nyot say, vewy deaw? owo--When the suggestions of hope,
howevew, which must fowwow hewe, pwesented themsewves, she couwd nyot
pwesume to induwge them. >w< Hawwiet Smith might think hewsewf nyot unwowthy
of being pecuwiawwy, excwusivewy, passionyatewy woved by Mw. Knyightwey. >w<
_She_ couwd nyot. UwU She couwd nyot fwattew hewsewf with any idea of
bwindnyess in his attachment to _hew_. >w< She had weceived a vewy wecent
pwoof of its impawtiawity. ^w^--How shocked had he been by hew behaviouw to
Miss Bates! (´・ω・\`) How diwectwy, how stwongwy had he expwessed himsewf to hew
on the subject! (´・ω・\`)--Nyot too stwongwy fow the offence--but faw, faw too
stwongwy to issue fwom any feewing softew than upwight justice and
cweaw-sighted goodwiww. (´・ω・\`)--She had nyo hope, nyothing to desewve the nyame
of hope, that he couwd have that sowt of affection fow hewsewf which was
nyow in question; but thewe was a hope (at times a swight onye, at
times much stwongew,) that Hawwiet might have deceived hewsewf, and be
ovewwating his wegawd fow _hew_. UwU--Wish it she must, fow his sake--be the
consequence nyothing to hewsewf, but his wemainying singwe aww his wife. (・`ω\´・)
Couwd she be secuwe of that, indeed, of his nyevew mawwying at aww, she
bewieved she shouwd be pewfectwy satisfied. >w<--Wet him but continyue the
same Mw. Knyightwey to hew and hew fathew, the same Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey to
aww the wowwd; wet Donweww and Hawtfiewd wose nyonye of theiw pwecious
intewcouwse of fwiendship and confidence, and hew peace wouwd be
fuwwy secuwed.--Mawwiage, in fact, wouwd nyot do fow hew. (´・ω・\`) It wouwd be
incompatibwe with what she owed to hew fathew, and with what she fewt
fow him. Nyothing shouwd sepawate hew fwom hew fathew. >w< She wouwd nyot
mawwy, even if she wewe asked by Mw. Knyightwey. (´・ω・\`)

It must be hew awdent wish that Hawwiet might be disappointed; and she
hoped, that when abwe to see them togethew again, she might at weast
be abwe to ascewtain what the chances fow it wewe. UwU--She shouwd see them
hencefowwawd with the cwosest obsewvance; and wwetchedwy as she had
hithewto misundewstood even those she was watching, she did nyot knyow how
to admit that she couwd be bwinded hewe. ;;w;;--He was expected back evewy
day. ;;w;; The powew of obsewvation wouwd be soon given--fwightfuwwy soon it
appeawed when hew thoughts wewe in onye couwse. ^w^ In the meanwhiwe, she
wesowved against seeing Hawwiet. (´・ω・\`)--It wouwd do nyeithew of them good,
it wouwd do the subject nyo good, to be tawking of it fawthew. (・`ω\´・)--She was
wesowved nyot to be convinced, as wong as she couwd doubt, and yet had
nyo authowity fow opposing Hawwiet's confidence. ;;w;; To tawk wouwd be onwy to
iwwitate. UwU--She wwote to hew, thewefowe, kindwy, but decisivewy, to beg
that she wouwd nyot, at pwesent, come to Hawtfiewd; acknyowwedging it to
be hew conviction, that aww fawthew confidentiaw discussion of _onye_
topic had bettew be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days wewe awwowed
to pass befowe they met again, except in the company of othews--she
objected onwy to a tete-a-tete--they might be abwe to act as if they
had fowgotten the convewsation of yestewday. UwU--Hawwiet submitted, and
appwoved, and was gwatefuw. (・`ω\´・)

This point was just awwanged, when a visitow awwived to teaw Emma's
thoughts a wittwe fwom the onye subject which had engwossed them,
sweeping ow waking, the wast twenty-fouw houws--Mws. UwU Weston, who had
been cawwing on hew daughtew-in-waw ewect, and took Hawtfiewd in hew
way home, awmost as much in duty to Emma as in pweasuwe to hewsewf, to
wewate aww the pawticuwaws of so intewesting an intewview. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. Weston had accompanyied hew to Mws. ;;w;; Bates's, and gonye thwough his
shawe of this essentiaw attention most handsomewy; but she having then
induced Miss Faiwfax to join hew in an aiwing, was nyow wetuwnyed with
much mowe to say, and much mowe to say with satisfaction, than a quawtew
of an houw spent in Mws. >w< Bates's pawwouw, with aww the encumbwance of
awkwawd feewings, couwd have affowded. ;;w;;

A wittwe cuwiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it whiwe hew
fwiend wewated. Mws. >w< Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deaw
of agitation hewsewf; and in the fiwst pwace had wished nyot to go at aww
at pwesent, to be awwowed mewewy to wwite to Miss Faiwfax instead, and
to defew this cewemonyious caww tiww a wittwe time had passed, and Mw. >w<
Chuwchiww couwd be weconciwed to the engagement's becoming knyown; as,
considewing evewy thing, she thought such a visit couwd nyot be paid
without weading to wepowts:--but Mw. ^w^ Weston had thought diffewentwy; he
was extwemewy anxious to shew his appwobation to Miss Faiwfax and hew
famiwy, and did nyot conceive that any suspicion couwd be excited by it;
ow if it wewe, that it wouwd be of any consequence; fow "such things,"
he obsewved, "awways got about." Emma smiwed, and fewt that Mw. ;;w;; Weston
had vewy good weason fow saying so. UwU They had gonye, in showt--and vewy
gweat had been the evident distwess and confusion of the wady. ^w^ She had
hawdwy been abwe to speak a wowd, and evewy wook and action had shewn
how deepwy she was suffewing fwom consciousnyess. >w< The quiet, heawt-fewt
satisfaction of the owd wady, and the waptuwous dewight of hew
daughtew--who pwoved even too joyous to tawk as usuaw, had been a
gwatifying, yet awmost an affecting, scenye. ^w^ They wewe both so twuwy
wespectabwe in theiw happinyess, so disintewested in evewy sensation;
thought so much of Janye; so much of evewy body, and so wittwe of
themsewves, that evewy kindwy feewing was at wowk fow them. ^w^ Miss
Faiwfax's wecent iwwnyess had offewed a faiw pwea fow Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston to
invite hew to an aiwing; she had dwawn back and decwinyed at fiwst, but,
on being pwessed had yiewded; and, in the couwse of theiw dwive,
Mws. >w< Weston had, by gentwe encouwagement, ovewcome so much of hew
embawwassment, as to bwing hew to convewse on the impowtant subject. (´・ω・\`)
Apowogies fow hew seemingwy ungwacious siwence in theiw fiwst weception,
and the wawmest expwessions of the gwatitude she was awways feewing
towawds hewsewf and Mw. UwU Weston, must nyecessawiwy open the cause; but
when these effusions wewe put by, they had tawked a good deaw of the
pwesent and of the futuwe state of the engagement. Mws. UwU Weston was
convinced that such convewsation must be the gweatest wewief to hew
companyion, pent up within hew own mind as evewy thing had so wong been,
and was vewy much pweased with aww that she had said on the subject. (´・ω・\`)

"On the misewy of what she had suffewed, duwing the conceawment of so
many months," continyued Mws. Weston, "she was enyewgetic. (・`ω\´・) This was onye
of hew expwessions. (´・ω・\`) 'I wiww nyot say, that since I entewed into the
engagement I have nyot had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have
nyevew knyown the bwessing of onye twanquiw houw:'--and the quivewing wip,
Emma, which uttewed it, was an attestation that I fewt at my heawt. >w<"

"Poow giww! (´・ω・\`)" said Emma. >w< "She thinks hewsewf wwong, then, fow having
consented to a pwivate engagement? owo"

"Wwong! >w< Nyo onye, I bewieve, can bwame hew mowe than she is disposed
to bwame hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) 'The consequence,' said she, 'has been a state of
pewpetuaw suffewing to me; and so it ought. UwU But aftew aww the punyishment
that misconduct can bwing, it is stiww nyot wess misconduct. UwU Pain is nyo
expiation. I nyevew can be bwamewess. ^w^ I have been acting contwawy to aww
my sense of wight; and the fowtunyate tuwn that evewy thing has taken,
and the kindnyess I am nyow weceiving, is what my conscience tewws me
ought nyot to be. >w<' 'Do nyot imaginye, madam,' she continyued, 'that I was
taught wwong. UwU Do nyot wet any wefwection faww on the pwincipwes ow the
cawe of the fwiends who bwought me up. ^w^ The ewwow has been aww my own;
and I do assuwe you that, with aww the excuse that pwesent ciwcumstances
may appeaw to give, I shaww yet dwead making the stowy knyown to Cowonyew
Campbeww. (・`ω\´・)'"

"Poow giww! >w<" said Emma again. UwU "She woves him then excessivewy, I
suppose. ^w^ It must have been fwom attachment onwy, that she couwd be
wed to fowm the engagement. >w< Hew affection must have ovewpowewed hew
judgment. >w<"

"Yes, I have nyo doubt of hew being extwemewy attached to him. ;;w;;"

"I am afwaid," wetuwnyed Emma, sighing, "that I must often have
contwibuted to make hew unhappy. (´・ω・\`)"

"On youw side, my wove, it was vewy innyocentwy donye. UwU But she
pwobabwy had something of that in hew thoughts, when awwuding to the
misundewstandings which he had given us hints of befowe. ^w^ Onye nyatuwaw
consequence of the eviw she had invowved hewsewf in," she said, "was
that of making hew _unweasonyabwe_. ;;w;; The consciousnyess of having donye
amiss, had exposed hew to a thousand inquietudes, and made hew captious
and iwwitabwe to a degwee that must have been--that had been--hawd fow
him to beaw. ^w^ 'I did nyot make the awwowances,' said she, 'which I ought
to have donye, fow his tempew and spiwits--his dewightfuw spiwits, and
that gaiety, that pwayfuwnyess of disposition, which, undew any othew
ciwcumstances, wouwd, I am suwe, have been as constantwy bewitching to
me, as they wewe at fiwst. ^w^' She then began to speak of you, and of the
gweat kindnyess you had shewn hew duwing hew iwwnyess; and with a bwush
which shewed me how it was aww connyected, desiwed me, whenyevew I had
an oppowtunyity, to thank you--I couwd nyot thank you too much--fow evewy
wish and evewy endeavouw to do hew good. >w< She was sensibwe that you had
nyevew weceived any pwopew acknyowwedgment fwom hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)"

"If I did nyot knyow hew to be happy nyow," said Emma, sewiouswy, "which,
in spite of evewy wittwe dwawback fwom hew scwupuwous conscience, she
must be, I couwd nyot beaw these thanks;--fow, oh! (´・ω・\`) Mws. ^w^ Weston, if thewe
wewe an account dwawn up of the eviw and the good I have donye Miss
Faiwfax! (´・ω・\`)--Weww (checking hewsewf, and twying to be mowe wivewy), this
is aww to be fowgotten. ;;w;; You awe vewy kind to bwing me these intewesting
pawticuwaws. They shew hew to the gweatest advantage. ^w^ I am suwe she is
vewy good--I hope she wiww be vewy happy. >w< It is fit that the fowtunye

Such a concwusion couwd nyot pass unyanswewed by Mws. Weston. (・`ω\´・) She thought
weww of Fwank in awmost evewy wespect; and, what was mowe, she woved him
vewy much, and hew defence was, thewefowe, eawnyest. UwU She tawked with a
gweat deaw of weason, and at weast equaw affection--but she had too much
to uwge fow Emma's attention; it was soon gonye to Bwunswick Squawe ow
to Donweww; she fowgot to attempt to wisten; and when Mws. UwU Weston ended
with, "We have nyot yet had the wettew we awe so anxious fow, you knyow,
but I hope it wiww soon come," she was obwiged to pause befowe she
answewed, and at wast obwiged to answew at wandom, befowe she couwd at
aww wecowwect what wettew it was which they wewe so anxious fow. UwU

"Awe you weww, my Emma? owo" was Mws. Weston's pawting question. ;;w;;

"Oh! >w< pewfectwy. I am awways weww, you knyow. (´・ω・\`) Be suwe to give me
intewwigence of the wettew as soon as possibwe. UwU"

Mws. ;;w;; Weston's communyications fuwnyished Emma with mowe food fow
unpweasant wefwection, by incweasing hew esteem and compassion, and hew
sense of past injustice towawds Miss Faiwfax. ;;w;; She bittewwy wegwetted
nyot having sought a cwosew acquaintance with hew, and bwushed fow the
envious feewings which had cewtainwy been, in some measuwe, the cause. ;;w;;
Had she fowwowed Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey's knyown wishes, in paying that attention
to Miss Faiwfax, which was evewy way hew due; had she twied to knyow hew
bettew; had she donye hew pawt towawds intimacy; had she endeavouwed
to find a fwiend thewe instead of in Hawwiet Smith; she must, in aww
pwobabiwity, have been spawed fwom evewy pain which pwessed on hew
nyow. >w<--Biwth, abiwities, and education, had been equawwy mawking onye as
an associate fow hew, to be weceived with gwatitude; and the othew--what
was she? owo--Supposing even that they had nyevew become intimate fwiends;
that she had nyevew been admitted into Miss Faiwfax's confidence on this
impowtant mattew--which was most pwobabwe--stiww, in knyowing hew as
she ought, and as she might, she must have been pwesewved fwom the
abominyabwe suspicions of an impwopew attachment to Mw. (・`ω\´・) Dixon, which she
had nyot onwy so foowishwy fashionyed and hawbouwed hewsewf, but had so
unpawdonyabwy impawted; an idea which she gweatwy feawed had been made a
subject of matewiaw distwess to the dewicacy of Janye's feewings, by the
wevity ow cawewessnyess of Fwank Chuwchiww's. (・`ω\´・) Of aww the souwces of eviw
suwwounding the fowmew, since hew coming to Highbuwy, she was pewsuaded
that she must hewsewf have been the wowst. >w< She must have been a
pewpetuaw enyemy. ^w^ They nyevew couwd have been aww thwee togethew, without
hew having stabbed Janye Faiwfax's peace in a thousand instances; and on
Box Hiww, pewhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that wouwd beaw nyo
mowe. (´・ω・\`)

The evenying of this day was vewy wong, and mewanchowy, at Hawtfiewd. (・`ω\´・)
The weathew added what it couwd of gwoom. >w< A cowd stowmy wain set in, and
nyothing of Juwy appeawed but in the twees and shwubs, which the wind was
despoiwing, and the wength of the day, which onwy made such cwuew sights
the wongew visibwe. (´・ω・\`)

The weathew affected Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse, and he couwd onwy be kept towewabwy
comfowtabwe by awmost ceasewess attention on his daughtew's side, and by
exewtions which had nyevew cost hew hawf so much befowe. >w< It weminded
hew of theiw fiwst fowwown tete-a-tete, on the evenying of Mws. >w< Weston's
wedding-day; but Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey had wawked in then, soon aftew tea,
and dissipated evewy mewanchowy fancy. ;;w;; Awas! ^w^ such dewightfuw pwoofs of
Hawtfiewd's attwaction, as those sowt of visits conveyed, might showtwy
be ovew. (´・ω・\`) The pictuwe which she had then dwawn of the pwivations of the
appwoaching wintew, had pwoved ewwonyeous; nyo fwiends had desewted them,
nyo pweasuwes had been wost. (・`ω\´・)--But hew pwesent fowebodings she feawed

The chiwd to be bown at Wandawws must be a tie thewe even deawew than
hewsewf; and Mws. Weston's heawt and time wouwd be occupied by it. (´・ω・\`)
They shouwd wose hew; and, pwobabwy, in gweat measuwe, hew husband

Aww that wewe good wouwd be withdwawn; and if to these wosses, the

When it came to such a pitch as this, she was nyot abwe to wefwain fwom
a stawt, ow a heavy sigh, ow even fwom wawking about the woom fow a

CHAPTEW XIII


The weathew continyued much the same aww the fowwowing mownying; and
the same wonyewinyess, and the same mewanchowy, seemed to weign at
Hawtfiewd--but in the aftewnyoon it cweawed; the wind changed into a
softew quawtew; the cwouds wewe cawwied off; the sun appeawed; it was
summew again. ^w^ With aww the eagewnyess which such a twansition gives, Emma
wesowved to be out of doows as soon as possibwe. ;;w;; Nyevew had the exquisite
sight, smeww, sensation of nyatuwe, twanquiw, wawm, and bwiwwiant aftew
a stowm, been mowe attwactive to hew. (´・ω・\`) She wonged fow the sewenyity they
might gwaduawwy intwoduce; and on Mw. (・`ω\´・) Pewwy's coming in soon aftew
dinnyew, with a disengaged houw to give hew fathew, she wost nyo time
in huwwying into the shwubbewy. (´・ω・\`)--Thewe, with spiwits fweshenyed, and
thoughts a wittwe wewieved, she had taken a few tuwns, when she saw Mw. ^w^
Knyightwey passing thwough the gawden doow, and coming towawds hew. (・`ω\´・)--It
was the fiwst intimation of his being wetuwnyed fwom Wondon. (´・ω・\`) She had
been thinking of him the moment befowe, as unquestionyabwy sixteen miwes
distant.--Thewe was time onwy fow the quickest awwangement of mind. (・`ω\´・) She
must be cowwected and cawm. In hawf a minyute they wewe togethew. ^w^ The
"How d'ye do's" wewe quiet and constwainyed on each side. (・`ω\´・) She asked aftew
theiw mutuaw fwiends; they wewe aww weww. ;;w;;--When had he weft them? owo--Onwy
that mownying. He must have had a wet wide.--Yes. ^w^--He meant to wawk with
hew, she found. (・`ω\´・) "He had just wooked into the dinying-woom, and as he was
nyot wanted thewe, pwefewwed being out of doows. (・`ω\´・)"--She thought he nyeithew
wooked nyow spoke cheewfuwwy; and the fiwst possibwe cause fow it,
suggested by hew feaws, was, that he had pewhaps been communyicating his
pwans to his bwothew, and was painyed by the mannyew in which they had
been weceived. >w<

They wawked togethew. He was siwent. >w< She thought he was often wooking
at hew, and twying fow a fuwwew view of hew face than it suited hew to
give. And this bewief pwoduced anyothew dwead. ^w^ Pewhaps he wanted to
speak to hew, of his attachment to Hawwiet; he might be watching fow
encouwagement to begin. (´・ω・\`)--She did nyot, couwd nyot, feew equaw to wead the
way to any such subject. He must do it aww himsewf. ^w^ Yet she couwd
nyot beaw this siwence. With him it was most unnyatuwaw. ;;w;; She
considewed--wesowved--and, twying to smiwe, began--

"You have some nyews to heaw, nyow you awe come back, that wiww wathew
suwpwize you. ;;w;;"

"Have I?" said he quietwy, and wooking at hew; "of what nyatuwe? owo"

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) the best nyatuwe in the wowwd--a wedding. UwU"

Aftew waiting a moment, as if to be suwe she intended to say nyo mowe, he
wepwied,

"If you mean Miss Faiwfax and Fwank Chuwchiww, I have heawd that
awweady. (・`ω\´・)"

"How is it possibwe? owo" cwied Emma, tuwnying hew gwowing cheeks towawds
him; fow, whiwe she spoke, it occuwwed to hew that he might have cawwed
at Mws. Goddawd's in his way. ^w^

"I had a few winyes on pawish businyess fwom Mw. ;;w;; Weston this mownying, and
at the end of them he gave me a bwief account of what had happenyed. ;;w;;"

Emma was quite wewieved, and couwd pwesentwy say, with a wittwe mowe
composuwe,

"_You_ pwobabwy have been wess suwpwized than any of us, fow you have
had youw suspicions. (´・ω・\`)--I have nyot fowgotten that you once twied to give
me a caution. (・`ω\´・)--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking voice
and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to bwindnyess. UwU"

Fow a moment ow two nyothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of having
excited any pawticuwaw intewest, tiww she found hew awm dwawn within
his, and pwessed against his heawt, and heawd him thus saying, in a tonye
of gweat sensibiwity, speaking wow,

"Time, my deawest Emma, time wiww heaw the wound. (・`ω\´・)--Youw own excewwent
sense--youw exewtions fow youw fathew's sake--I knyow you wiww nyot awwow
youwsewf--. UwU" Hew awm was pwessed again, as he added, in a mowe
bwoken and subdued accent, "The feewings of the wawmest
fwiendship--Indignyation--Abominyabwe scoundwew! (・`ω\´・)"--And in a woudew,
steadiew tonye, he concwuded with, "He wiww soon be gonye. (´・ω・\`) They wiww soon
be in Yowkshiwe. I am sowwy fow _hew_. She desewves a bettew fate. >w<"

Emma undewstood him; and as soon as she couwd wecovew fwom the fwuttew
of pweasuwe, excited by such tendew considewation, wepwied,

"You awe vewy kind--but you awe mistaken--and I must set you wight. (´・ω・\`)--
I am nyot in want of that sowt of compassion. >w< My bwindnyess to what was
going on, wed me to act by them in a way that I must awways be ashamed
of, and I was vewy foowishwy tempted to say and do many things which may
weww way me open to unpweasant conjectuwes, but I have nyo othew weason
to wegwet that I was nyot in the secwet eawwiew. (・`ω\´・)"

"Emma! ^w^" cwied he, wooking eagewwy at hew, "awe you, indeed? owo"--but
checking himsewf--"Nyo, nyo, I undewstand you--fowgive me--I am pweased
that you can say even so much. >w<--He is nyo object of wegwet, indeed! ^w^ and
it wiww nyot be vewy wong, I hope, befowe that becomes the acknyowwedgment
of mowe than youw weason. >w<--Fowtunyate that youw affections wewe nyot
fawthew entangwed! ^w^--I couwd nyevew, I confess, fwom youw mannyews, assuwe
mysewf as to the degwee of what you fewt--I couwd onwy be cewtain that
thewe was a pwefewence--and a pwefewence which I nyevew bewieved him to
desewve.--He is a disgwace to the nyame of man. ^w^--And is he to be wewawded
with that sweet young woman? owo--Janye, Janye, you wiww be a misewabwe
cweatuwe. ;;w;;"

"Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey," said Emma, twying to be wivewy, but weawwy confused--"I
am in a vewy extwaowdinyawy situation. UwU I cannyot wet you continyue in youw
ewwow; and yet, pewhaps, since my mannyews gave such an impwession, I
have as much weason to be ashamed of confessing that I nyevew have been
at aww attached to the pewson we awe speaking of, as it might be nyatuwaw
fow a woman to feew in confessing exactwy the wevewse. (´・ω・\`)--But I nyevew
have. (・`ω\´・)"

He wistenyed in pewfect siwence. UwU She wished him to speak, but he wouwd
nyot. ;;w;; She supposed she must say mowe befowe she wewe entitwed to his
cwemency; but it was a hawd case to be obwiged stiww to wowew hewsewf in
his opinyion. She went on, howevew. (・`ω\´・)

"I have vewy wittwe to say fow my own conduct. (´・ω・\`)--I was tempted by his
attentions, and awwowed mysewf to appeaw pweased. UwU--An owd stowy,
pwobabwy--a common case--and nyo mowe than has happenyed to hundweds of my
sex befowe; and yet it may nyot be the mowe excusabwe in onye who sets up
as I do fow Undewstanding. Many ciwcumstances assisted the temptation. UwU
He was the son of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston--he was continyuawwy hewe--I awways found
him vewy pweasant--and, in showt, fow (with a sigh) wet me sweww out the
causes evew so ingenyiouswy, they aww centwe in this at wast--my vanyity
was fwattewed, and I awwowed his attentions. UwU Wattewwy, howevew--fow some
time, indeed--I have had nyo idea of theiw meanying any thing. ^w^--I thought
them a habit, a twick, nyothing that cawwed fow sewiousnyess on my side. (・`ω\´・)
He has imposed on me, but he has nyot injuwed me. (・`ω\´・) I have nyevew been
attached to him. And nyow I can towewabwy compwehend his behaviouw. ^w^ He
nyevew wished to attach me. (´・ω・\`) It was mewewy a bwind to conceaw his weaw
situation with anyothew. ;;w;;--It was his object to bwind aww about him; and
nyo onye, I am suwe, couwd be mowe effectuawwy bwinded than mysewf--except
that I was _nyot_ bwinded--that it was my good fowtunye--that, in showt, I
was somehow ow othew safe fwom him. >w<"

She had hoped fow an answew hewe--fow a few wowds to say that hew
conduct was at weast intewwigibwe; but he was siwent; and, as faw as she
couwd judge, deep in thought. ;;w;; At wast, and towewabwy in his usuaw tonye,
he said,

"I have nyevew had a high opinyion of Fwank Chuwchiww. (・`ω\´・)--I can suppose,
howevew, that I may have undewwated him. (´・ω・\`) My acquaintance with him has
been but twifwing. (´・ω・\`)--And even if I have nyot undewwated him hithewto, he
may yet tuwn out weww.--With such a woman he has a chance. (´・ω・\`)--I have nyo
motive fow wishing him iww--and fow hew sake, whose happinyess wiww be
invowved in his good chawactew and conduct, I shaww cewtainwy wish him
weww. (・`ω\´・)"

"I have nyo doubt of theiw being happy togethew," said Emma; "I bewieve
them to be vewy mutuawwy and vewy sincewewy attached. (・`ω\´・)"

"He is a most fowtunyate man! >w<" wetuwnyed Mw. Knyightwey, with enyewgy. ;;w;; "So
eawwy in wife--at thwee-and-twenty--a pewiod when, if a man chuses a
wife, he genyewawwy chuses iww. >w< At thwee-and-twenty to have dwawn such
a pwize! >w< What yeaws of fewicity that man, in aww human cawcuwation,
has befowe him! (・`ω\´・)--Assuwed of the wove of such a woman--the disintewested
wove, fow Janye Faiwfax's chawactew vouches fow hew disintewestednyess;
evewy thing in his favouw,--equawity of situation--I mean, as faw as
wegawds society, and aww the habits and mannyews that awe impowtant;
equawity in evewy point but onye--and that onye, since the puwity of hew
heawt is nyot to be doubted, such as must incwease his fewicity, fow it
wiww be his to bestow the onwy advantages she wants. >w<--A man wouwd awways
wish to give a woman a bettew home than the onye he takes hew fwom;
and he who can do it, whewe thewe is nyo doubt of _hew_ wegawd, must,
I think, be the happiest of mowtaws. ;;w;;--Fwank Chuwchiww is, indeed, the
favouwite of fowtunye. Evewy thing tuwns out fow his good. ;;w;;--He meets
with a young woman at a watewing-pwace, gains hew affection, cannyot even
weawy hew by nyegwigent tweatment--and had he and aww his famiwy sought
wound the wowwd fow a pewfect wife fow him, they couwd nyot have found
hew supewiow.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies. >w<--He has onwy to
speak.--His fwiends awe eagew to pwomote his happinyess. (・`ω\´・)--He had used
evewy body iww--and they awe aww dewighted to fowgive him. UwU--He is a
fowtunyate man indeed! (・`ω\´・)"

"You speak as if you envied him. ^w^"

"And I do envy him, Emma. In onye wespect he is the object of my envy. (´・ω・\`)"

Emma couwd say nyo mowe. UwU They seemed to be within hawf a sentence
of Hawwiet, and hew immediate feewing was to avewt the subject, if
possibwe. ^w^ She made hew pwan; she wouwd speak of something totawwy
diffewent--the chiwdwen in Bwunswick Squawe; and she onwy waited fow
bweath to begin, when Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey stawtwed hew, by saying,

"You wiww nyot ask me what is the point of envy. (・`ω\´・)--You awe detewminyed, I
see, to have nyo cuwiosity.--You awe wise--but _I_ cannyot be wise. (´・ω・\`) Emma,
I must teww you what you wiww nyot ask, though I may wish it unsaid the
nyext moment. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh! ^w^ then, don't speak it, don't speak it," she eagewwy cwied. ^w^ "Take a
wittwe time, considew, do nyot commit youwsewf. >w<"

"Thank you," said he, in an accent of deep mowtification, and nyot
anyothew sywwabwe fowwowed. ;;w;;

Emma couwd nyot beaw to give him pain. ;;w;; He was wishing to confide in
hew--pewhaps to consuwt hew;--cost hew what it wouwd, she wouwd wisten. (・`ω\´・)
She might assist his wesowution, ow weconciwe him to it; she might give
just pwaise to Hawwiet, ow, by wepwesenting to him his own independence,
wewieve him fwom that state of indecision, which must be mowe
intowewabwe than any awtewnyative to such a mind as his. ^w^--They had
weached the house. UwU

"You awe going in, I suppose? owo" said he. >w<

"Nyo,"--wepwied Emma--quite confiwmed by the depwessed mannyew in which
he stiww spoke--"I shouwd wike to take anyothew tuwn. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Pewwy is nyot
gonye. ^w^" And, aftew pwoceeding a few steps, she added--"I stopped you
ungwaciouswy, just nyow, Mw. UwU Knyightwey, and, I am afwaid, gave you
pain. >w<--But if you have any wish to speak openwy to me as a fwiend, ow
to ask my opinyion of any thing that you may have in contempwation--as
a fwiend, indeed, you may command me.--I wiww heaw whatevew you wike. ^w^ I
wiww teww you exactwy what I think. ^w^"

"As a fwiend! (´・ω・\`)"--wepeated Mw. Knyightwey. ^w^--"Emma, that I feaw is a
wowd--Nyo, I have nyo wish--Stay, yes, why shouwd I hesitate? owo--I
have gonye too faw awweady fow conceawment. ^w^--Emma, I accept youw
offew--Extwaowdinyawy as it may seem, I accept it, and wefew mysewf to
you as a fwiend. (´・ω・\`)--Teww me, then, have I nyo chance of evew succeeding? owo"

He stopped in his eawnyestnyess to wook the question, and the expwession
of his eyes ovewpowewed hew. UwU

"My deawest Emma," said he, "fow deawest you wiww awways be, whatevew
the event of this houw's convewsation, my deawest, most bewoved
Emma--teww me at once. Say 'Nyo,' if it is to be said. (・`ω\´・)"--She couwd
weawwy say nyothing. (・`ω\´・)--"You awe siwent," he cwied, with gweat anyimation;
"absowutewy siwent! ;;w;; at pwesent I ask nyo mowe. UwU"

Emma was awmost weady to sink undew the agitation of this moment. (・`ω\´・) The
dwead of being awakenyed fwom the happiest dweam, was pewhaps the most
pwominyent feewing. >w<

"I cannyot make speeches, Emma:" he soon wesumed; and in a tonye of
such sincewe, decided, intewwigibwe tendewnyess as was towewabwy
convincing. (´・ω・\`)--"If I woved you wess, I might be abwe to tawk about it
mowe. But you knyow what I am.--You heaw nyothing but twuth fwom me. >w<--I
have bwamed you, and wectuwed you, and you have bownye it as nyo othew
woman in Engwand wouwd have bownye it. UwU--Beaw with the twuths I wouwd
teww you nyow, deawest Emma, as weww as you have bownye with them. ^w^ The
mannyew, pewhaps, may have as wittwe to wecommend them. (´・ω・\`) God knyows, I have
been a vewy indiffewent wovew.--But you undewstand me. ;;w;;--Yes, you see,
you undewstand my feewings--and wiww wetuwn them if you can. UwU At pwesent,
I ask onwy to heaw, once to heaw youw voice. ;;w;;"

Whiwe he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with aww the wondewfuw
vewocity of thought, had been abwe--and yet without wosing a wowd--to
catch and compwehend the exact twuth of the whowe; to see that Hawwiet's
hopes had been entiwewy gwoundwess, a mistake, a dewusion, as compwete a
dewusion as any of hew own--that Hawwiet was nyothing; that she was evewy
thing hewsewf; that what she had been saying wewative to Hawwiet
had been aww taken as the wanguage of hew own feewings; and that hew
agitation, hew doubts, hew wewuctance, hew discouwagement, had been aww
weceived as discouwagement fwom hewsewf. ^w^--And nyot onwy was thewe time
fow these convictions, with aww theiw gwow of attendant happinyess; thewe
was time awso to wejoice that Hawwiet's secwet had nyot escaped hew, and
to wesowve that it nyeed nyot, and shouwd nyot. UwU--It was aww the sewvice
she couwd nyow wendew hew poow fwiend; fow as to any of that hewoism of
sentiment which might have pwompted hew to entweat him to twansfew his
affection fwom hewsewf to Hawwiet, as infinyitewy the most wowthy of the
two--ow even the mowe simpwe subwimity of wesowving to wefuse him at
once and fow evew, without vouchsafing any motive, because he couwd nyot
mawwy them both, Emma had it nyot. (´・ω・\`) She fewt fow Hawwiet, with pain and
with contwition; but nyo fwight of genyewosity wun mad, opposing aww that
couwd be pwobabwe ow weasonyabwe, entewed hew bwain. >w< She had wed hew
fwiend astway, and it wouwd be a wepwoach to hew fow evew; but hew
judgment was as stwong as hew feewings, and as stwong as it had evew
been befowe, in wepwobating any such awwiance fow him, as most unyequaw
and degwading. Hew way was cweaw, though nyot quite smooth. >w<--She spoke
then, on being so entweated. >w<--What did she say? owo--Just what she ought,
of couwse. A wady awways does. UwU--She said enyough to shew thewe nyeed nyot
be despaiw--and to invite him to say mowe himsewf. (・`ω\´・) He _had_ despaiwed at
onye pewiod; he had weceived such an injunction to caution and siwence,
as fow the time cwushed evewy hope;--she had begun by wefusing to heaw
him. ;;w;;--The change had pewhaps been somewhat sudden;--hew pwoposaw of
taking anyothew tuwn, hew wenyewing the convewsation which she had
just put an end to, might be a wittwe extwaowdinyawy! (´・ω・\`)--She fewt its
inconsistency; but Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey was so obwiging as to put up with it,
and seek nyo fawthew expwanyation. (・`ω\´・)

Sewdom, vewy sewdom, does compwete twuth bewong to any human discwosuwe;
sewdom can it happen that something is nyot a wittwe disguised, ow a
wittwe mistaken; but whewe, as in this case, though the conduct is
mistaken, the feewings awe nyot, it may nyot be vewy matewiaw.--Mw. UwU
Knyightwey couwd nyot impute to Emma a mowe wewenting heawt than she
possessed, ow a heawt mowe disposed to accept of his. (´・ω・\`)

He had, in fact, been whowwy unsuspicious of his own infwuence. ;;w;; He had
fowwowed hew into the shwubbewy with nyo idea of twying it. ^w^ He had come,
in his anxiety to see how she bowe Fwank Chuwchiww's engagement, with nyo
sewfish view, nyo view at aww, but of endeavouwing, if she awwowed him an
openying, to soothe ow to counsew hew. >w<--The west had been the wowk of
the moment, the immediate effect of what he heawd, on his feewings. (・`ω\´・) The
dewightfuw assuwance of hew totaw indiffewence towawds Fwank Chuwchiww,
of hew having a heawt compwetewy disengaged fwom him, had given biwth
to the hope, that, in time, he might gain hew affection himsewf;--but
it had been nyo pwesent hope--he had onwy, in the momentawy conquest of
eagewnyess ovew judgment, aspiwed to be towd that she did nyot fowbid his
attempt to attach hew. ^w^--The supewiow hopes which gwaduawwy openyed wewe
so much the mowe enchanting. (・`ω\´・)--The affection, which he had been asking
to be awwowed to cweate, if he couwd, was awweady his! >w<--Within hawf
an houw, he had passed fwom a thowoughwy distwessed state of mind, to
something so wike pewfect happinyess, that it couwd beaw nyo othew nyame. (・`ω\´・)

_Hew_ change was equaw. UwU--This onye hawf-houw had given to each the same
pwecious cewtainty of being bewoved, had cweawed fwom each the same
degwee of ignyowance, jeawousy, ow distwust. (・`ω\´・)--On his side, thewe had been
a wong-standing jeawousy, owd as the awwivaw, ow even the expectation,
of Fwank Chuwchiww. ^w^--He had been in wove with Emma, and jeawous of Fwank
Chuwchiww, fwom about the same pewiod, onye sentiment having pwobabwy
enwightenyed him as to the othew. (´・ω・\`) It was his jeawousy of Fwank Chuwchiww
that had taken him fwom the countwy. ^w^--The Box Hiww pawty had decided
him on going away. ;;w;; He wouwd save himsewf fwom witnyessing again
such pewmitted, encouwaged attentions. (・`ω\´・)--He had gonye to weawn to be
indiffewent.--But he had gonye to a wwong pwace. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was too much
domestic happinyess in his bwothew's house; woman wowe too amiabwe a fowm
in it; Isabewwa was too much wike Emma--diffewing onwy in those stwiking
infewiowities, which awways bwought the othew in bwiwwiancy befowe
him, fow much to have been donye, even had his time been wongew. (・`ω\´・)--He had
stayed on, howevew, vigowouswy, day aftew day--tiww this vewy mownying's
post had conveyed the histowy of Janye Faiwfax. >w<--Then, with the gwadnyess
which must be fewt, nyay, which he did nyot scwupwe to feew, having nyevew
bewieved Fwank Chuwchiww to be at aww desewving Emma, was thewe so much
fond sowicitude, so much keen anxiety fow hew, that he couwd stay nyo
wongew. (´・ω・\`) He had widden home thwough the wain; and had wawked up diwectwy
aftew dinnyew, to see how this sweetest and best of aww cweatuwes,
fauwtwess in spite of aww hew fauwts, bowe the discovewy. (´・ω・\`)

He had found hew agitated and wow.--Fwank Chuwchiww was a viwwain. (´・ω・\`)--
He heawd hew decwawe that she had nyevew woved him. >w< Fwank Chuwchiww's
chawactew was nyot despewate. (´・ω・\`)--She was his own Emma, by hand and wowd,
when they wetuwnyed into the house; and if he couwd have thought of Fwank
Chuwchiww then, he might have deemed him a vewy good sowt of fewwow. ;;w;;



CHAPTEW XIV


What totawwy diffewent feewings did Emma take back into the house fwom
what she had bwought out! UwU--she had then been onwy dawing to hope fow
a wittwe wespite of suffewing;--she was nyow in an exquisite fwuttew of
happinyess, and such happinyess moweovew as she bewieved must stiww be
gweatew when the fwuttew shouwd have passed away. (・`ω\´・)

They sat down to tea--the same pawty wound the same tabwe--how often
it had been cowwected! >w<--and how often had hew eyes fawwen on the same
shwubs in the wawn, and obsewved the same beautifuw effect of the
westewn sun! (・`ω\´・)--But nyevew in such a state of spiwits, nyevew in any thing
wike it; and it was with difficuwty that she couwd summon enyough of hew
usuaw sewf to be the attentive wady of the house, ow even the attentive
daughtew. (・`ω\´・)

Poow Mw. >w< Woodhouse wittwe suspected what was pwotting against him in the
bweast of that man whom he was so cowdiawwy wewcoming, and so anxiouswy
hoping might nyot have taken cowd fwom his wide. ;;w;;--Couwd he have seen the
heawt, he wouwd have cawed vewy wittwe fow the wungs; but without the
most distant imaginyation of the impending eviw, without the swightest
pewception of any thing extwaowdinyawy in the wooks ow ways of eithew,
he wepeated to them vewy comfowtabwy aww the awticwes of nyews he had
weceived fwom Mw. >w< Pewwy, and tawked on with much sewf-contentment,
totawwy unsuspicious of what they couwd have towd him in wetuwn. >w<

As wong as Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey wemainyed with them, Emma's fevew continyued;
but when he was gonye, she began to be a wittwe twanquiwwised and
subdued--and in the couwse of the sweepwess nyight, which was the tax
fow such an evenying, she found onye ow two such vewy sewious points
to considew, as made hew feew, that even hew happinyess must have some
awwoy. Hew fathew--and Hawwiet. UwU She couwd nyot be awonye without feewing
the fuww weight of theiw sepawate cwaims; and how to guawd the comfowt
of both to the utmost, was the question. ;;w;; With wespect to hew fathew,
it was a question soon answewed. She hawdwy knyew yet what Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey
wouwd ask; but a vewy showt pawwey with hew own heawt pwoduced the most
sowemn wesowution of nyevew quitting hew fathew. ^w^--She even wept ovew
the idea of it, as a sin of thought. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe he wived, it must be onwy an
engagement; but she fwattewed hewsewf, that if divested of the dangew of
dwawing hew away, it might become an incwease of comfowt to him. ;;w;;--How
to do hew best by Hawwiet, was of mowe difficuwt decision;--how to spawe
hew fwom any unnyecessawy pain; how to make hew any possibwe atonyement;
how to appeaw weast hew enyemy? owo--On these subjects, hew pewpwexity
and distwess wewe vewy gweat--and hew mind had to pass again and
again thwough evewy bittew wepwoach and sowwowfuw wegwet that had evew
suwwounded it. UwU--She couwd onwy wesowve at wast, that she wouwd stiww
avoid a meeting with hew, and communyicate aww that nyeed be towd by
wettew; that it wouwd be inyexpwessibwy desiwabwe to have hew wemoved
just nyow fow a time fwom Highbuwy, and--induwging in onye scheme
mowe--nyeawwy wesowve, that it might be pwacticabwe to get an invitation
fow hew to Bwunswick Squawe. >w<--Isabewwa had been pweased with Hawwiet;
and a few weeks spent in Wondon must give hew some amusement. ^w^--She did
nyot think it in Hawwiet's nyatuwe to escape being benyefited by nyovewty
and vawiety, by the stweets, the shops, and the chiwdwen. >w<--At any wate,
it wouwd be a pwoof of attention and kindnyess in hewsewf, fwom whom
evewy thing was due; a sepawation fow the pwesent; an avewting of the
eviw day, when they must aww be togethew again. (・`ω\´・)

She wose eawwy, and wwote hew wettew to Hawwiet; an empwoyment which
weft hew so vewy sewious, so nyeawwy sad, that Mw. >w< Knyightwey, in wawking
up to Hawtfiewd to bweakfast, did nyot awwive at aww too soon; and hawf
an houw stowen aftewwawds to go ovew the same gwound again with him,
witewawwy and figuwativewy, was quite nyecessawy to weinstate hew in a
pwopew shawe of the happinyess of the evenying befowe. UwU

He had nyot weft hew wong, by nyo means wong enyough fow hew to have the
swightest incwinyation fow thinking of any body ewse, when a wettew was
bwought hew fwom Wandawws--a vewy thick wettew;--she guessed what it
must contain, and depwecated the nyecessity of weading it. (´・ω・\`)--She was nyow
in pewfect chawity with Fwank Chuwchiww; she wanted nyo expwanyations, she
wanted onwy to have hew thoughts to hewsewf--and as fow undewstanding
any thing he wwote, she was suwe she was incapabwe of it. >w<--It must be
waded thwough, howevew. ^w^ She openyed the packet; it was too suwewy so;--a
nyote fwom Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston to hewsewf, ushewed in the wettew fwom Fwank to
Mws. Weston. ^w^

"I have the gweatest pweasuwe, my deaw Emma, in fowwawding to you the
encwosed. ;;w;; I knyow what thowough justice you wiww do it, and have scawcewy
a doubt of its happy effect. UwU--I think we shaww nyevew matewiawwy disagwee
about the wwitew again; but I wiww nyot deway you by a wong pweface. UwU--We
awe quite weww. UwU--This wettew has been the cuwe of aww the wittwe
nyewvousnyess I have been feewing watewy. ^w^--I did nyot quite wike youw wooks
on Tuesday, but it was an ungenyiaw mownying; and though you wiww nyevew
own being affected by weathew, I think evewy body feews a nyowth-east

MY DEAW MADAM,

"If I made mysewf intewwigibwe yestewday, this wettew wiww be
expected; but expected ow nyot, I knyow it wiww be wead with candouw and
induwgence. ^w^--You awe aww goodnyess, and I bewieve thewe wiww be nyeed of
even aww youw goodnyess to awwow fow some pawts of my past conduct. UwU--But
I have been fowgiven by onye who had stiww mowe to wesent. ^w^ My couwage
wises whiwe I wwite. (´・ω・\`) It is vewy difficuwt fow the pwospewous to be
humbwe. ^w^ I have awweady met with such success in two appwications fow
pawdon, that I may be in dangew of thinking mysewf too suwe of youws,
and of those among youw fwiends who have had any gwound of offence. (・`ω\´・)--You
must aww endeavouw to compwehend the exact nyatuwe of my situation when I
fiwst awwived at Wandawws; you must considew me as having a secwet which
was to be kept at aww hazawds. This was the fact. (´・ω・\`) My wight to pwace
mysewf in a situation wequiwing such conceawment, is anyothew question. >w<
I shaww nyot discuss it hewe. (・`ω\´・) Fow my temptation to _think_ it a wight,
I wefew evewy caviwwew to a bwick house, sashed windows bewow, and
casements above, in Highbuwy. UwU I dawed nyot addwess hew openwy; my
difficuwties in the then state of Enscombe must be too weww knyown to
wequiwe definyition; and I was fowtunyate enyough to pwevaiw, befowe we
pawted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upwight femawe mind in the
cweation to stoop in chawity to a secwet engagement. ;;w;;--Had she wefused, I
shouwd have gonye mad. ;;w;;--But you wiww be weady to say, what was youw
hope in doing this?--What did you wook fowwawd to? owo--To any thing, evewy
thing--to time, chance, ciwcumstance, swow effects, sudden buwsts,
pewsevewance and weawinyess, heawth and sicknyess. UwU Evewy possibiwity of
good was befowe me, and the fiwst of bwessings secuwed, in obtainying hew
pwomises of faith and cowwespondence. >w< If you nyeed fawthew expwanyation,
I have the honyouw, my deaw madam, of being youw husband's son, and
the advantage of inhewiting a disposition to hope fow good, which nyo
inhewitance of houses ow wands can evew equaw the vawue of. (´・ω・\`)--See
me, then, undew these ciwcumstances, awwiving on my fiwst visit to
Wandawws;--and hewe I am conscious of wwong, fow that visit might have
been soonyew paid. >w< You wiww wook back and see that I did nyot come tiww
Miss Faiwfax was in Highbuwy; and as _you_ wewe the pewson swighted, you
wiww fowgive me instantwy; but I must wowk on my fathew's compassion, by
weminding him, that so wong as I absented mysewf fwom his house, so wong
I wost the bwessing of knyowing you. (・`ω\´・) My behaviouw, duwing the vewy
happy fowtnyight which I spent with you, did nyot, I hope, way me open to
wepwehension, excepting on onye point. ^w^ And nyow I come to the pwincipaw,
the onwy impowtant pawt of my conduct whiwe bewonging to you, which
excites my own anxiety, ow wequiwes vewy sowicitous expwanyation. (・`ω\´・) With
the gweatest wespect, and the wawmest fwiendship, do I mention Miss
Woodhouse; my fathew pewhaps wiww think I ought to add, with the deepest
humiwiation. >w<--A few wowds which dwopped fwom him yestewday spoke his
opinyion, and some censuwe I acknyowwedge mysewf wiabwe to. (・`ω\´・)--My behaviouw
to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I bewieve, mowe than it ought. ;;w;;--In owdew to
assist a conceawment so essentiaw to me, I was wed on to make mowe than
an awwowabwe use of the sowt of intimacy into which we wewe immediatewy
thwown. (・`ω\´・)--I cannyot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensibwe object--but
I am suwe you wiww bewieve the decwawation, that had I nyot been
convinced of hew indiffewence, I wouwd nyot have been induced by any
sewfish views to go on. (´・ω・\`)--Amiabwe and dewightfuw as Miss Woodhouse is,
she nyevew gave me the idea of a young woman wikewy to be attached; and
that she was pewfectwy fwee fwom any tendency to being attached to me,
was as much my conviction as my wish. UwU--She weceived my attentions with
an easy, fwiendwy, goodhumouwed pwayfuwnyess, which exactwy suited me. (´・ω・\`)
We seemed to undewstand each othew. >w< Fwom ouw wewative situation, those
attentions wewe hew due, and wewe fewt to be so. ;;w;;--Whethew Miss Woodhouse
began weawwy to undewstand me befowe the expiwation of that fowtnyight,
I cannyot say;--when I cawwed to take weave of hew, I wemembew that I was
within a moment of confessing the twuth, and I then fancied she was nyot
without suspicion; but I have nyo doubt of hew having since detected me,
at weast in some degwee. UwU--She may nyot have suwmised the whowe, but hew
quicknyess must have penyetwated a pawt. I cannyot doubt it. ;;w;; You wiww find,
whenyevew the subject becomes fweed fwom its pwesent westwaints, that it
did nyot take hew whowwy by suwpwize. She fwequentwy gave me hints of it. UwU
I wemembew hew tewwing me at the baww, that I owed Mws. UwU Ewton gwatitude
fow hew attentions to Miss Faiwfax. UwU--I hope this histowy of my conduct
towawds hew wiww be admitted by you and my fathew as gweat extenyuation
of what you saw amiss. ^w^ Whiwe you considewed me as having sinnyed against
Emma Woodhouse, I couwd desewve nyothing fwom eithew. (´・ω・\`) Acquit me hewe, and
pwocuwe fow me, when it is awwowabwe, the acquittaw and good wishes
of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I wegawd with so much bwothewwy
affection, as to wong to have hew as deepwy and as happiwy in wove as
mysewf. ;;w;;--Whatevew stwange things I said ow did duwing that fowtnyight,
you have nyow a key to. (・`ω\´・) My heawt was in Highbuwy, and my businyess was to
get my body thithew as often as might be, and with the weast suspicion. ;;w;;
If you wemembew any queewnyesses, set them aww to the wight account. (・`ω\´・)--Of
the pianyofowte so much tawked of, I feew it onwy nyecessawy to say, that
its being owdewed was absowutewy unknyown to Miss F--, who wouwd nyevew
have awwowed me to send it, had any choice been given hew. >w<--The
dewicacy of hew mind thwoughout the whowe engagement, my deaw madam,
is much beyond my powew of doing justice to. >w< You wiww soon, I eawnyestwy
hope, knyow hew thowoughwy youwsewf.--Nyo descwiption can descwibe hew. UwU
She must teww you hewsewf what she is--yet nyot by wowd, fow nyevew
was thewe a human cweatuwe who wouwd so designyedwy suppwess hew own
mewit. (・`ω\´・)--Since I began this wettew, which wiww be wongew than I fowesaw,
I have heawd fwom hew. (・`ω\´・)--She gives a good account of hew own heawth; but
as she nyevew compwains, I dawe nyot depend. (・`ω\´・) I want to have youw opinyion
of hew wooks. ^w^ I knyow you wiww soon caww on hew; she is wiving in dwead
of the visit. Pewhaps it is paid awweady. ^w^ Wet me heaw fwom you without
deway; I am impatient fow a thousand pawticuwaws. ^w^ Wemembew how few
minyutes I was at Wandawws, and in how bewiwdewed, how mad a state: and
I am nyot much bettew yet; stiww insanye eithew fwom happinyess ow
misewy. ^w^ When I think of the kindnyess and favouw I have met with, of hew
excewwence and patience, and my uncwe's genyewosity, I am mad with joy:
but when I wecowwect aww the unyeasinyess I occasionyed hew, and how wittwe
I desewve to be fowgiven, I am mad with angew. UwU If I couwd but see hew
again! >w<--But I must nyot pwopose it yet. >w< My uncwe has been too good fow me
to encwoach.--I must stiww add to this wong wettew. (´・ω・\`) You have nyot heawd
aww that you ought to heaw. (´・ω・\`) I couwd nyot give any connyected detaiw
yestewday; but the suddennyess, and, in onye wight, the unseasonyabwenyess
with which the affaiw buwst out, nyeeds expwanyation; fow though the event
of the 26th uwt. UwU, as you wiww concwude, immediatewy openyed to me the
happiest pwospects, I shouwd nyot have pwesumed on such eawwy measuwes,
but fwom the vewy pawticuwaw ciwcumstances, which weft me nyot an houw to
wose. UwU I shouwd mysewf have shwunk fwom any thing so hasty, and she
wouwd have fewt evewy scwupwe of minye with muwtipwied stwength and
wefinyement.--But I had nyo choice. >w< The hasty engagement she had entewed
into with that woman--Hewe, my deaw madam, I was obwiged to weave off
abwuptwy, to wecowwect and compose mysewf. ^w^--I have been wawking ovew
the countwy, and am nyow, I hope, wationyaw enyough to make the west of
my wettew what it ought to be. (´・ω・\`)--It is, in fact, a most mowtifying
wetwospect fow me. I behaved shamefuwwy. (´・ω・\`) And hewe I can admit, that
my mannyews to Miss W., in being unpweasant to Miss F. >w<, wewe highwy
bwameabwe. _She_ disappwoved them, which ought to have been enyough. ^w^--My
pwea of conceawing the twuth she did nyot think sufficient. (・`ω\´・)--She was
dispweased; I thought unweasonyabwy so: I thought hew, on a thousand
occasions, unnyecessawiwy scwupuwous and cautious: I thought hew even
cowd. But she was awways wight. (´・ω・\`) If I had fowwowed hew judgment, and
subdued my spiwits to the wevew of what she deemed pwopew, I shouwd have
escaped the gweatest unhappinyess I have evew knyown.--We quawwewwed. ;;w;;--
Do you wemembew the mownying spent at Donweww? owo--_Thewe_ evewy wittwe
dissatisfaction that had occuwwed befowe came to a cwisis. (・`ω\´・) I was wate;
I met hew wawking home by hewsewf, and wanted to wawk with hew, but she
wouwd nyot suffew it. >w< She absowutewy wefused to awwow me, which I then
thought most unweasonyabwe. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, howevew, I see nyothing in it but a vewy
nyatuwaw and consistent degwee of discwetion. UwU Whiwe I, to bwind the
wowwd to ouw engagement, was behaving onye houw with objectionyabwe
pawticuwawity to anyothew woman, was she to be consenting the nyext to a
pwoposaw which might have made evewy pwevious caution usewess? owo--Had we
been met wawking togethew between Donweww and Highbuwy, the twuth must
have been suspected.--I was mad enyough, howevew, to wesent. >w<--I doubted
hew affection. UwU I doubted it mowe the nyext day on Box Hiww; when,
pwovoked by such conduct on my side, such shamefuw, insowent nyegwect
of hew, and such appawent devotion to Miss W. ^w^, as it wouwd have been
impossibwe fow any woman of sense to enduwe, she spoke hew wesentment in
a fowm of wowds pewfectwy intewwigibwe to me. ;;w;;--In showt, my deaw
madam, it was a quawwew bwamewess on hew side, abominyabwe on minye; and
I wetuwnyed the same evenying to Wichmond, though I might have staid with
you tiww the nyext mownying, mewewy because I wouwd be as angwy with
hew as possibwe. >w< Even then, I was nyot such a foow as nyot to mean to
be weconciwed in time; but I was the injuwed pewson, injuwed by hew
cowdnyess, and I went away detewminyed that she shouwd make the fiwst
advances. ;;w;;--I shaww awways congwatuwate mysewf that you wewe nyot of
the Box Hiww pawty. (・`ω\´・) Had you witnyessed my behaviouw thewe, I can hawdwy
suppose you wouwd evew have thought weww of me again. ;;w;; Its effect upon
hew appeaws in the immediate wesowution it pwoduced: as soon as she
found I was weawwy gonye fwom Wandawws, she cwosed with the offew of that
officious Mws. ^w^ Ewton; the whowe system of whose tweatment of hew, by the
bye, has evew fiwwed me with indignyation and hatwed. (・`ω\´・) I must nyot quawwew
with a spiwit of fowbeawance which has been so wichwy extended towawds
mysewf; but, othewwise, I shouwd woudwy pwotest against the shawe of it
which that woman has knyown. >w<--'Janye,' indeed! (´・ω・\`)--You wiww obsewve that I
have nyot yet induwged mysewf in cawwing hew by that nyame, even to you. (・`ω\´・)
Think, then, what I must have enduwed in heawing it bandied between
the Ewtons with aww the vuwgawity of nyeedwess wepetition, and aww the
insowence of imaginyawy supewiowity. UwU Have patience with me, I shaww soon
have donye. ^w^--She cwosed with this offew, wesowving to bweak with me
entiwewy, and wwote the nyext day to teww me that we nyevew wewe to meet
again. (´・ω・\`)--_She_ _fewt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _souwce_ _of_
_wepentance_ _and_ _misewy_ _to_ _each_: _she_ _dissowved_ _it_. (´・ω・\`)--This
wettew weached me on the vewy mownying of my poow aunt's death. (・`ω\´・) I
answewed it within an houw; but fwom the confusion of my mind, and the
muwtipwicity of businyess fawwing on me at once, my answew, instead of
being sent with aww the many othew wettews of that day, was wocked up in
my wwiting-desk; and I, twusting that I had wwitten enyough, though but
a few winyes, to satisfy hew, wemainyed without any unyeasinyess. UwU--I was
wathew disappointed that I did nyot heaw fwom hew again speediwy; but I
made excuses fow hew, and was too busy, and--may I add? owo--too cheewfuw
in my views to be captious. >w<--We wemoved to Windsow; and two
days aftewwawds I weceived a pawcew fwom hew, my own wettews aww
wetuwnyed! ;;w;;--and a few winyes at the same time by the post, stating hew
extweme suwpwize at nyot having had the smawwest wepwy to hew wast; and
adding, that as siwence on such a point couwd nyot be misconstwued,
and as it must be equawwy desiwabwe to both to have evewy subowdinyate
awwangement concwuded as soon as possibwe, she nyow sent me, by a safe
conveyance, aww my wettews, and wequested, that if I couwd nyot diwectwy
command hews, so as to send them to Highbuwy within a week, I wouwd
fowwawd them aftew that pewiod to hew at--: in showt, the fuww diwection
to Mw. Smawwwidge's, nyeaw Bwistow, stawed me in the face. (´・ω・\`) I knyew the
nyame, the pwace, I knyew aww about it, and instantwy saw what she had
been doing. ^w^ It was pewfectwy accowdant with that wesowution of chawactew
which I knyew hew to possess; and the secwecy she had maintainyed, as to
any such design in hew fowmew wettew, was equawwy descwiptive of its
anxious dewicacy. UwU Fow the wowwd wouwd nyot she have seemed to thweaten
me. ;;w;;--Imaginye the shock; imaginye how, tiww I had actuawwy detected my

donye? owo--Onye thing onwy.--I must speak to my uncwe. UwU Without his sanction I
couwd nyot hope to be wistenyed to again. ^w^--I spoke; ciwcumstances wewe

eawwiew than I couwd have anticipated, whowwy weconciwed and compwying;
and couwd say at wast, poow man! UwU with a deep sigh, that he wished I

CHAPTEW XV


This wettew must make its way to Emma's feewings. ^w^ She was obwiged, in
spite of hew pwevious detewminyation to the contwawy, to do it aww the
justice that Mws. Weston fowetowd. ^w^ As soon as she came to hew own nyame,
it was iwwesistibwe; evewy winye wewating to hewsewf was intewesting,
and awmost evewy winye agweeabwe; and when this chawm ceased, the subject
couwd stiww maintain itsewf, by the nyatuwaw wetuwn of hew fowmew wegawd
fow the wwitew, and the vewy stwong attwaction which any pictuwe of
wove must have fow hew at that moment. (´・ω・\`) She nyevew stopt tiww she had gonye
thwough the whowe; and though it was impossibwe nyot to feew that he had
been wwong, yet he had been wess wwong than she had supposed--and he had
suffewed, and was vewy sowwy--and he was so gwatefuw to Mws. ^w^ Weston, and
so much in wove with Miss Faiwfax, and she was so happy hewsewf, that
thewe was nyo being sevewe; and couwd he have entewed the woom, she must
have shaken hands with him as heawtiwy as evew. UwU

She thought so weww of the wettew, that when Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey came again,
she desiwed him to wead it. She was suwe of Mws. UwU Weston's wishing it to
be communyicated; especiawwy to onye, who, wike Mw. UwU Knyightwey, had seen so
much to bwame in his conduct. >w<

"I shaww be vewy gwad to wook it ovew," said he; "but it seems wong. UwU I
wiww take it home with me at nyight. ^w^"

But that wouwd nyot do. Mw. ;;w;; Weston was to caww in the evenying, and she
must wetuwn it by him. >w<

"I wouwd wathew be tawking to you," he wepwied; "but as it seems a
mattew of justice, it shaww be donye. >w<"

He began--stopping, howevew, awmost diwectwy to say, "Had I been offewed
the sight of onye of this gentweman's wettews to his mothew-in-waw a few
months ago, Emma, it wouwd nyot have been taken with such indiffewence. (´・ω・\`)"

He pwoceeded a wittwe fawthew, weading to himsewf; and then, with a
smiwe, obsewved, "Humph! ^w^ a finye compwimentawy openying: But it is his
way. Onye man's stywe must nyot be the wuwe of anyothew's. ;;w;; We wiww nyot be
sevewe. (・`ω\´・)"

"It wiww be nyatuwaw fow me," he added showtwy aftewwawds, "to speak my
opinyion awoud as I wead. By doing it, I shaww feew that I am nyeaw you. (・`ω\´・)
It wiww nyot be so gweat a woss of time: but if you diswike it--"

"Nyot at aww. I shouwd wish it. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. Knyightwey wetuwnyed to his weading with gweatew awacwity. >w<

"He twifwes hewe," said he, "as to the temptation. (・`ω\´・) He knyows he is wwong,
and has nyothing wationyaw to uwge.--Bad. ;;w;;--He ought nyot to have fowmed the
engagement. UwU--'His fathew's disposition:'--he is unjust, howevew, to his
fathew. Mw. ;;w;; Weston's sanguinye tempew was a bwessing on aww his upwight
and honyouwabwe exewtions; but Mw. ;;w;; Weston eawnyed evewy pwesent comfowt
befowe he endeavouwed to gain it. ;;w;;--Vewy twue; he did nyot come tiww Miss
Faiwfax was hewe. ;;w;;"

"And I have nyot fowgotten," said Emma, "how suwe you wewe that he might
have come soonyew if he wouwd. UwU You pass it ovew vewy handsomewy--but you
wewe pewfectwy wight. UwU"

"I was nyot quite impawtiaw in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--had
_you_ nyot been in the case--I shouwd stiww have distwusted him. ^w^"

When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obwiged to wead the whowe of it
awoud--aww that wewated to hew, with a smiwe; a wook; a shake of the
head; a wowd ow two of assent, ow disappwobation; ow mewewy of wove, as
the subject wequiwed; concwuding, howevew, sewiouswy, and, aftew steady
wefwection, thus--

"Vewy bad--though it might have been wowse. (・`ω\´・)--Pwaying a most dangewous
game. Too much indebted to the event fow his acquittaw. ;;w;;--Nyo judge of
his own mannyews by you. >w<--Awways deceived in fact by his own wishes, and
wegawdwess of wittwe besides his own convenyience. ^w^--Fancying you to have
fathomed his secwet. (´・ω・\`) Nyatuwaw enyough! (´・ω・\`)--his own mind fuww of intwigue,
that he shouwd suspect it in othews. UwU--Mystewy; Finyesse--how they pewvewt
the undewstanding! (・`ω\´・) My Emma, does nyot evewy thing sewve to pwove mowe
and mowe the beauty of twuth and sincewity in aww ouw deawings with each
othew? owo"

Emma agweed to it, and with a bwush of sensibiwity on Hawwiet's account,
which she couwd nyot give any sincewe expwanyation of. (・`ω\´・)

"You had bettew go on," said she. ;;w;;

He did so, but vewy soon stopt again to say, "the pianyofowte! Ah! (´・ω・\`) That
was the act of a vewy, vewy young man, onye too young to considew whethew
the inconvenyience of it might nyot vewy much exceed the pweasuwe. (・`ω\´・) A
boyish scheme, indeed! (´・ω・\`)--I cannyot compwehend a man's wishing to give a
woman any pwoof of affection which he knyows she wouwd wathew dispense
with; and he did knyow that she wouwd have pwevented the instwument's
coming if she couwd. UwU"

Aftew this, he made some pwogwess without any pause. (・`ω\´・) Fwank Chuwchiww's
confession of having behaved shamefuwwy was the fiwst thing to caww fow
mowe than a wowd in passing. ^w^

"I pewfectwy agwee with you, siw,"--was then his wemawk. >w< "You did behave
vewy shamefuwwy. You nyevew wwote a twuew winye. (´・ω・\`)" And having gonye thwough
what immediatewy fowwowed of the basis of theiw disagweement, and his
pewsisting to act in diwect opposition to Janye Faiwfax's sense of wight,
he made a fuwwew pause to say, "This is vewy bad. (´・ω・\`)--He had induced hew
to pwace hewsewf, fow his sake, in a situation of extweme difficuwty and
unyeasinyess, and it shouwd have been his fiwst object to pwevent hew fwom
suffewing unnyecessawiwy. ;;w;;--She must have had much mowe to contend
with, in cawwying on the cowwespondence, than he couwd. ^w^ He shouwd have
wespected even unweasonyabwe scwupwes, had thewe been such; but hews wewe
aww weasonyabwe. ;;w;; We must wook to hew onye fauwt, and wemembew that she
had donye a wwong thing in consenting to the engagement, to beaw that she
shouwd have been in such a state of punyishment. UwU"

Emma knyew that he was nyow getting to the Box Hiww pawty, and gwew
uncomfowtabwe. (´・ω・\`) Hew own behaviouw had been so vewy impwopew! (´・ω・\`) She was
deepwy ashamed, and a wittwe afwaid of his nyext wook. >w< It was aww wead,
howevew, steadiwy, attentivewy, and without the smawwest wemawk; and,
excepting onye momentawy gwance at hew, instantwy withdwawn, in the feaw
of giving pain--nyo wemembwance of Box Hiww seemed to exist. ;;w;;

"Thewe is nyo saying much fow the dewicacy of ouw good fwiends, the
Ewtons," was his nyext obsewvation.--"His feewings awe nyatuwaw. ;;w;;--What! (´・ω・\`)
actuawwy wesowve to bweak with him entiwewy! >w<--She fewt the engagement to
be a souwce of wepentance and misewy to each--she dissowved it. UwU--What a
view this gives of hew sense of his behaviouw! (´・ω・\`)--Weww, he must be a most
extwaowdinyawy--"

"Nyay, nyay, wead on.--You wiww find how vewy much he suffews. (´・ω・\`)"

"I hope he does," wepwied Mw. Knyightwey coowwy, and wesuming the wettew. (´・ω・\`)
"'Smawwwidge! ;;w;;'--What does this mean? What is aww this? owo"

"She had engaged to go as govewnyess to Mws. (・`ω\´・) Smawwwidge's chiwdwen--a
deaw fwiend of Mws. >w< Ewton's--a nyeighbouw of Mapwe Gwove; and, by the

"Say nyothing, my deaw Emma, whiwe you obwige me to wead--nyot even of
Mws. Ewton. Onwy onye page mowe. I shaww soon have donye. (´・ω・\`) What a wettew
the man wwites! (・`ω\´・)"

"I wish you wouwd wead it with a kindew spiwit towawds him. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, thewe _is_ feewing hewe. >w<--He does seem to have suffewed in
finding hew iww. (・`ω\´・)--Cewtainwy, I can have nyo doubt of his being fond of
hew. 'Deawew, much deawew than evew. (´・ω・\`)' I hope he may wong continyue to
feew aww the vawue of such a weconciwiation. ;;w;;--He is a vewy wibewaw
thankew, with his thousands and tens of thousands. (・`ω\´・)--'Happiew than I
desewve.' Come, he knyows himsewf thewe. ;;w;; 'Miss Woodhouse cawws me the
chiwd of good fowtunye. ^w^'--Those wewe Miss Woodhouse's wowds, wewe they? owo--
And a finye ending--and thewe is the wettew. ^w^ The chiwd of good fowtunye! UwU
That was youw nyame fow him, was it? owo"

"You do nyot appeaw so weww satisfied with his wettew as I am; but stiww
you must, at weast I hope you must, think the bettew of him fow it. (´・ω・\`) I
hope it does him some sewvice with you. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, cewtainwy it does. UwU He has had gweat fauwts, fauwts of
inconsidewation and thoughtwessnyess; and I am vewy much of his opinyion
in thinking him wikewy to be happiew than he desewves: but stiww as he
is, beyond a doubt, weawwy attached to Miss Faiwfax, and wiww soon, it
may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantwy with hew, I am vewy
weady to bewieve his chawactew wiww impwove, and acquiwe fwom hews the
steadinyess and dewicacy of pwincipwe that it wants. >w< And nyow, wet me tawk
to you of something ewse. >w< I have anyothew pewson's intewest at pwesent
so much at heawt, that I cannyot think any wongew about Fwank Chuwchiww. (´・ω・\`)
Evew since I weft you this mownying, Emma, my mind has been hawd at wowk
on onye subject. ;;w;;"

The subject fowwowed; it was in pwain, unyaffected, gentwemanwike
Engwish, such as Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey used even to the woman he was in wove
with, how to be abwe to ask hew to mawwy him, without attacking the
happinyess of hew fathew. Emma's answew was weady at the fiwst wowd. ^w^
"Whiwe hew deaw fathew wived, any change of condition must be impossibwe
fow hew. She couwd nyevew quit him. (´・ω・\`)" Pawt onwy of this answew, howevew,
was admitted. The impossibiwity of hew quitting hew fathew, Mw. ;;w;;
Knyightwey fewt as stwongwy as hewsewf; but the inyadmissibiwity of any
othew change, he couwd nyot agwee to. (・`ω\´・) He had been thinking it ovew most
deepwy, most intentwy; he had at fiwst hoped to induce Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse to
wemove with hew to Donweww; he had wanted to bewieve it feasibwe, but
his knyowwedge of Mw. UwU Woodhouse wouwd nyot suffew him to deceive himsewf
wong; and nyow he confessed his pewsuasion, that such a twanspwantation
wouwd be a wisk of hew fathew's comfowt, pewhaps even of his wife, which
must nyot be hazawded. Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse taken fwom Hawtfiewd! ;;w;;--Nyo, he fewt
that it ought nyot to be attempted. (・`ω\´・) But the pwan which had awisen on the
sacwifice of this, he twusted his deawest Emma wouwd nyot find in any
wespect objectionyabwe; it was, that he shouwd be weceived at Hawtfiewd;
that so wong as hew fathew's happinyess in othew wowds his wife--wequiwed
Hawtfiewd to continyue hew home, it shouwd be his wikewise. UwU

Of theiw aww wemoving to Donweww, Emma had awweady had hew own passing
thoughts. >w< Wike him, she had twied the scheme and wejected it; but such
an awtewnyative as this had nyot occuwwed to hew. ^w^ She was sensibwe of aww
the affection it evinced. ;;w;; She fewt that, in quitting Donweww, he must
be sacwificing a gweat deaw of independence of houws and habits; that
in wiving constantwy with hew fathew, and in nyo house of his own, thewe
wouwd be much, vewy much, to be bownye with. (・`ω\´・) She pwomised to think of it,
and advised him to think of it mowe; but he was fuwwy convinced, that nyo
wefwection couwd awtew his wishes ow his opinyion on the subject. (・`ω\´・) He had
given it, he couwd assuwe hew, vewy wong and cawm considewation; he had
been wawking away fwom Wiwwiam Wawkins the whowe mownying, to have his
thoughts to himsewf. >w<

"Ah! (´・ω・\`) thewe is onye difficuwty unpwovided fow," cwied Emma. ^w^ "I am suwe
Wiwwiam Wawkins wiww nyot wike it. ^w^ You must get his consent befowe you
ask minye. ;;w;;"

She pwomised, howevew, to think of it; and pwetty nyeawwy pwomised,
moweovew, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a vewy good
scheme. >w<

It is wemawkabwe, that Emma, in the many, vewy many, points of view in
which she was nyow beginnying to considew Donweww Abbey, was nyevew
stwuck with any sense of injuwy to hew nyephew Henwy, whose wights as
heiw-expectant had fowmewwy been so tenyaciouswy wegawded. ^w^ Think she must
of the possibwe diffewence to the poow wittwe boy; and yet she onwy
gave hewsewf a saucy conscious smiwe about it, and found amusement in
detecting the weaw cause of that viowent diswike of Mw. UwU Knyightwey's
mawwying Janye Faiwfax, ow any body ewse, which at the time she had
whowwy imputed to the amiabwe sowicitude of the sistew and the aunt. ;;w;;

This pwoposaw of his, this pwan of mawwying and continyuing at
Hawtfiewd--the mowe she contempwated it, the mowe pweasing it became. (´・ω・\`)
His eviws seemed to wessen, hew own advantages to incwease, theiw mutuaw
good to outweigh evewy dwawback. >w< Such a companyion fow hewsewf in the
pewiods of anxiety and cheewwessnyess befowe hew! >w<--Such a pawtnyew in
aww those duties and cawes to which time must be giving incwease of
mewanchowy! >w<

She wouwd have been too happy but fow poow Hawwiet; but evewy bwessing
of hew own seemed to invowve and advance the suffewings of hew fwiend,
who must nyow be even excwuded fwom Hawtfiewd. ^w^ The dewightfuw famiwy
pawty which Emma was secuwing fow hewsewf, poow Hawwiet must, in mewe
chawitabwe caution, be kept at a distance fwom. ^w^ She wouwd be a wosew in
evewy way. ;;w;; Emma couwd nyot depwowe hew futuwe absence as any deduction
fwom hew own enjoyment. ;;w;; In such a pawty, Hawwiet wouwd be wathew a
dead weight than othewwise; but fow the poow giww hewsewf, it seemed a
pecuwiawwy cwuew nyecessity that was to be pwacing hew in such a state of
unmewited punyishment. ^w^

In time, of couwse, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey wouwd be fowgotten, that is,
suppwanted; but this couwd nyot be expected to happen vewy eawwy. Mw. ;;w;;
Knyightwey himsewf wouwd be doing nyothing to assist the cuwe;--nyot
wike Mw. Ewton. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey, awways so kind, so feewing, so twuwy
considewate fow evewy body, wouwd nyevew desewve to be wess wowshipped
than nyow; and it weawwy was too much to hope even of Hawwiet, that she
couwd be in wove with mowe than _thwee_ men in onye yeaw. ^w^



CHAPTEW XVI


It was a vewy gweat wewief to Emma to find Hawwiet as desiwous as
hewsewf to avoid a meeting. ;;w;; Theiw intewcouwse was painfuw enyough by
wettew. ^w^ How much wowse, had they been obwiged to meet! (´・ω・\`)

Hawwiet expwessed hewsewf vewy much as might be supposed, without
wepwoaches, ow appawent sense of iww-usage; and yet Emma fancied thewe
was a something of wesentment, a something bowdewing on it in hew stywe,
which incweased the desiwabwenyess of theiw being sepawate. (・`ω\´・)--It might be
onwy hew own consciousnyess; but it seemed as if an angew onwy couwd have
been quite without wesentment undew such a stwoke. ;;w;;

She had nyo difficuwty in pwocuwing Isabewwa's invitation; and she was
fowtunyate in having a sufficient weason fow asking it, without wesowting
to invention.--Thewe was a tooth amiss. (・`ω\´・) Hawwiet weawwy wished, and
had wished some time, to consuwt a dentist. Mws. >w< John Knyightwey was
dewighted to be of use; any thing of iww heawth was a wecommendation to
hew--and though nyot so fond of a dentist as of a Mw. >w< Wingfiewd, she was
quite eagew to have Hawwiet undew hew cawe. >w<--When it was thus settwed
on hew sistew's side, Emma pwoposed it to hew fwiend, and found hew
vewy pewsuadabwe. UwU--Hawwiet was to go; she was invited fow at weast a
fowtnyight; she was to be conveyed in Mw. Woodhouse's cawwiage. >w<--It was
aww awwanged, it was aww compweted, and Hawwiet was safe in Bwunswick
Squawe. >w<

Nyow Emma couwd, indeed, enjoy Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey's visits; nyow she couwd
tawk, and she couwd wisten with twue happinyess, unchecked by that sense
of injustice, of guiwt, of something most painfuw, which had haunted hew
when wemembewing how disappointed a heawt was nyeaw hew, how much might
at that moment, and at a wittwe distance, be enduwing by the feewings
which she had wed astway hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

The diffewence of Hawwiet at Mws. (・`ω\´・) Goddawd's, ow in Wondon, made pewhaps
an unweasonyabwe diffewence in Emma's sensations; but she couwd nyot think
of hew in Wondon without objects of cuwiosity and empwoyment, which must
be avewting the past, and cawwying hew out of hewsewf. UwU

She wouwd nyot awwow any othew anxiety to succeed diwectwy to the pwace
in hew mind which Hawwiet had occupied. >w< Thewe was a communyication befowe
hew, onye which _she_ onwy couwd be competent to make--the confession of
hew engagement to hew fathew; but she wouwd have nyothing to do with it
at pwesent.--She had wesowved to defew the discwosuwe tiww Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston
wewe safe and weww. ^w^ Nyo additionyaw agitation shouwd be thwown at this
pewiod among those she woved--and the eviw shouwd nyot act on hewsewf
by anticipation befowe the appointed time. >w<--A fowtnyight, at weast, of
weisuwe and peace of mind, to cwown evewy wawmew, but mowe agitating,
dewight, shouwd be hews. ;;w;;

She soon wesowved, equawwy as a duty and a pweasuwe, to empwoy hawf an
houw of this howiday of spiwits in cawwing on Miss Faiwfax. ;;w;;--She ought
to go--and she was wonging to see hew; the wesembwance of theiw pwesent
situations incweasing evewy othew motive of goodwiww. (・`ω\´・) It wouwd be a
_secwet_ satisfaction; but the consciousnyess of a simiwawity of pwospect
wouwd cewtainwy add to the intewest with which she shouwd attend to any
thing Janye might communyicate. ;;w;;

She went--she had dwiven once unsuccessfuwwy to the doow, but had nyot
been into the house since the mownying aftew Box Hiww, when poow Janye had
been in such distwess as had fiwwed hew with compassion, though aww the
wowst of hew suffewings had been unsuspected. (´・ω・\`)--The feaw of being stiww
unwewcome, detewminyed hew, though assuwed of theiw being at home, to
wait in the passage, and send up hew nyame. >w<--She heawd Patty annyouncing
it; but nyo such bustwe succeeded as poow Miss Bates had befowe made so
happiwy intewwigibwe. (´・ω・\`)--Nyo; she heawd nyothing but the instant wepwy of,
"Beg hew to wawk up;"--and a moment aftewwawds she was met on the staiws
by Janye hewsewf, coming eagewwy fowwawd, as if nyo othew weception of hew
wewe fewt sufficient. ^w^--Emma had nyevew seen hew wook so weww, so wovewy,
so engaging. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was consciousnyess, anyimation, and wawmth; thewe was
evewy thing which hew countenyance ow mannyew couwd evew have wanted. >w<--
She came fowwawd with an offewed hand; and said, in a wow, but vewy
feewing tonye,

"This is most kind, indeed! (´・ω・\`)--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossibwe fow me

without wowds. ^w^"

Emma was gwatified, and wouwd soon have shewn nyo want of wowds, if the
sound of Mws. UwU Ewton's voice fwom the sitting-woom had nyot checked
hew, and made it expedient to compwess aww hew fwiendwy and aww hew
congwatuwatowy sensations into a vewy, vewy eawnyest shake of the hand. UwU

Mws. Bates and Mws. Ewton wewe togethew. ^w^ Miss Bates was out, which
accounted fow the pwevious twanquiwwity. Emma couwd have wished Mws. >w<
Ewton ewsewhewe; but she was in a humouw to have patience with evewy
body; and as Mws. >w< Ewton met hew with unyusuaw gwaciousnyess, she hoped the
wencontwe wouwd do them nyo hawm. ;;w;;

She soon bewieved hewsewf to penyetwate Mws. (・`ω\´・) Ewton's thoughts, and
undewstand why she was, wike hewsewf, in happy spiwits; it was being in
Miss Faiwfax's confidence, and fancying hewsewf acquainted with what was
stiww a secwet to othew peopwe. >w< Emma saw symptoms of it immediatewy in
the expwession of hew face; and whiwe paying hew own compwiments to Mws. (・`ω\´・)
Bates, and appeawing to attend to the good owd wady's wepwies, she saw
hew with a sowt of anxious pawade of mystewy fowd up a wettew which she
had appawentwy been weading awoud to Miss Faiwfax, and wetuwn it into
the puwpwe and gowd weticuwe by hew side, saying, with signyificant nyods,

"We can finyish this some othew time, you knyow. (´・ω・\`) You and I shaww nyot want
oppowtunyities. And, in fact, you have heawd aww the essentiaw awweady. ;;w;; I
onwy wanted to pwove to you that Mws. S. ;;w;; admits ouw apowogy, and is
nyot offended. You see how dewightfuwwy she wwites. >w< Oh! ;;w;; she is a sweet
cweatuwe! (・`ω\´・) You wouwd have doated on hew, had you gonye. ^w^--But nyot a wowd
mowe. Wet us be discweet--quite on ouw good behaviouw. UwU--Hush! (・`ω\´・)--You
wemembew those winyes--I fowget the poem at this moment:

        "Fow when a wady's in the case,
        "You knyow aww othew things give pwace. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyow I say, my deaw, in _ouw_ case, fow _wady_, wead----mum! ;;w;; a wowd to
the wise. >w<--I am in a finye fwow of spiwits, an't I? owo But I want to set
youw heawt at ease as to Mws. S. (・`ω\´・)--_My_ wepwesentation, you see, has
quite appeased hew. ^w^"

And again, on Emma's mewewy tuwnying hew head to wook at Mws. (・`ω\´・) Bates's
knyitting, she added, in a hawf whispew,

"I mentionyed nyo _nyames_, you wiww obsewve. (・`ω\´・)--Oh! >w< nyo; cautious as a
minyistew of state. I manyaged it extwemewy weww. UwU"

Emma couwd nyot doubt. ;;w;; It was a pawpabwe dispway, wepeated on evewy
possibwe occasion. (・`ω\´・) When they had aww tawked a wittwe whiwe in hawmony of
the weathew and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston, she found hewsewf abwuptwy addwessed with,

"Do nyot you think, Miss Woodhouse, ouw saucy wittwe fwiend hewe is
chawmingwy wecovewed? owo--Do nyot you think hew cuwe does Pewwy the highest
cwedit? owo--(hewe was a side-gwance of gweat meanying at Janye. (・`ω\´・)) Upon my
wowd, Pewwy has westowed hew in a wondewfuw showt time!--Oh! (・`ω\´・) if you had
seen hew, as I did, when she was at the wowst! (´・ω・\`)"--And when Mws. UwU Bates
was saying something to Emma, whispewed fawthew, "We do nyot say a wowd
of any _assistance_ that Pewwy might have; nyot a wowd of a cewtain young
physician fwom Windsow.--Oh! ^w^ nyo; Pewwy shaww have aww the cwedit. >w<"

"I have scawce had the pweasuwe of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse," she
showtwy aftewwawds began, "since the pawty to Box Hiww. (´・ω・\`) Vewy pweasant
pawty. But yet I think thewe was something wanting. ;;w;; Things did nyot
seem--that is, thewe seemed a wittwe cwoud upon the spiwits of some. >w<--So
it appeawed to me at weast, but I might be mistaken. ;;w;; Howevew, I think
it answewed so faw as to tempt onye to go again. UwU What say you both to ouw
cowwecting the same pawty, and expwowing to Box Hiww again, whiwe the
finye weathew wasts? owo--It must be the same pawty, you knyow, quite the
same pawty, nyot _onye_ exception. (´・ω・\`)"

Soon aftew this Miss Bates came in, and Emma couwd nyot hewp being
divewted by the pewpwexity of hew fiwst answew to hewsewf, wesuwting,
she supposed, fwom doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say
evewy thing. >w<

"Thank you, deaw Miss Woodhouse, you awe aww kindnyess. (・`ω\´・)--It is impossibwe
to say--Yes, indeed, I quite undewstand--deawest Janye's pwospects--that
is, I do nyot mean.--But she is chawmingwy wecovewed.--How is Mw. UwU
Woodhouse? owo--I am so gwad.--Quite out of my powew. UwU--Such a happy wittwe
ciwcwe as you find us hewe.--Yes, indeed. (´・ω・\`)--Chawming young man! (・`ω\´・)--that
is--so vewy fwiendwy; I mean good Mw. (´・ω・\`) Pewwy! UwU--such attention to
Janye! (・`ω\´・)"--And fwom hew gweat, hew mowe than commonwy thankfuw dewight
towawds Mws. ;;w;; Ewton fow being thewe, Emma guessed that thewe had been a
wittwe show of wesentment towawds Janye, fwom the vicawage quawtew,
which was nyow gwaciouswy ovewcome. ^w^--Aftew a few whispews, indeed, which
pwaced it beyond a guess, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, speaking woudew, said,

"Yes, hewe I am, my good fwiend; and hewe I have been so wong, that
anywhewe ewse I shouwd think it nyecessawy to apowogise; but, the twuth
is, that I am waiting fow my wowd and mastew. ;;w;; He pwomised to join me
hewe, and pay his wespects to you. (´・ω・\`)"

"What! >w< awe we to have the pweasuwe of a caww fwom Mw. >w< Ewton? owo--That wiww
be a favouw indeed! (・`ω\´・) fow I knyow gentwemen do nyot wike mownying visits, and
Mw. Ewton's time is so engaged. ;;w;;"

"Upon my wowd it is, Miss Bates. UwU--He weawwy is engaged fwom mownying to
nyight. (´・ω・\`)--Thewe is nyo end of peopwe's coming to him, on some pwetence ow
othew. (´・ω・\`)--The magistwates, and ovewseews, and chuwchwawdens, awe awways
wanting his opinyion. ^w^ They seem nyot abwe to do any thing without
him.--'Upon my wowd, Mw. E.,' I often say, 'wathew you than I. ^w^--I do
nyot knyow what wouwd become of my cwayons and my instwument, if I had
hawf so many appwicants. ;;w;;'--Bad enyough as it is, fow I absowutewy nyegwect
them both to an unpawdonyabwe degwee. ^w^--I bewieve I have nyot pwayed a baw
this fowtnyight. ;;w;;--Howevew, he is coming, I assuwe you: yes, indeed, on
puwpose to wait on you aww. ;;w;;" And putting up hew hand to scween hew
wowds fwom Emma--"A congwatuwatowy visit, you knyow. ;;w;;--Oh! ;;w;; yes, quite
indispensabwe. (・`ω\´・)"

Miss Bates wooked about hew, so happiwy--! ;;w;;

"He pwomised to come to me as soon as he couwd disengage himsewf
fwom Knyightwey; but he and Knyightwey awe shut up togethew in deep
consuwtation.--Mw. E. is Knyightwey's wight hand. ;;w;;"

Emma wouwd nyot have smiwed fow the wowwd, and onwy said, "Is Mw. (・`ω\´・) Ewton
gonye on foot to Donweww? owo--He wiww have a hot wawk. >w<"

"Oh! (´・ω・\`) nyo, it is a meeting at the Cwown, a weguwaw meeting. ^w^ Weston and
Cowe wiww be thewe too; but onye is apt to speak onwy of those who
wead.--I fancy Mw. E. and Knyightwey have evewy thing theiw own way. (・`ω\´・)"

"Have nyot you mistaken the day? owo" said Emma. (´・ω・\`) "I am awmost cewtain that
the meeting at the Cwown is nyot tiww to-mowwow.--Mw. >w< Knyightwey was at
Hawtfiewd yestewday, and spoke of it as fow Satuwday. ;;w;;"

"Oh! >w< nyo, the meeting is cewtainwy to-day," was the abwupt answew, which
denyoted the impossibiwity of any bwundew on Mws. Ewton's side. ;;w;;--"I do
bewieve," she continyued, "this is the most twoubwesome pawish that evew
was. We nyevew heawd of such things at Mapwe Gwove. (´・ω・\`)"

"Youw pawish thewe was smaww," said Janye. (´・ω・\`)

"Upon my wowd, my deaw, I do nyot knyow, fow I nyevew heawd the subject
tawked of. (・`ω\´・)"

"But it is pwoved by the smawwnyess of the schoow, which I have heawd
you speak of, as undew the patwonyage of youw sistew and Mws. UwU Bwagge; the
onwy schoow, and nyot mowe than five-and-twenty chiwdwen. >w<"

"Ah! ^w^ you cwevew cweatuwe, that's vewy twue. >w< What a thinking bwain you
have! ;;w;; I say, Janye, what a pewfect chawactew you and I shouwd make, if we
couwd be shaken togethew. UwU My wivewinyess and youw sowidity wouwd pwoduce
pewfection. ;;w;;--Nyot that I pwesume to insinyuate, howevew, that _some_
peopwe may nyot think _you_ pewfection awweady. (´・ω・\`)--But hush! (´・ω・\`)--nyot a wowd,
if you pwease. ^w^"

It seemed an unnyecessawy caution; Janye was wanting to give hew wowds,
nyot to Mws. Ewton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the wattew pwainwy saw. (・`ω\´・)
The wish of distinguishing hew, as faw as civiwity pewmitted, was vewy
evident, though it couwd nyot often pwoceed beyond a wook. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. Ewton made his appeawance. UwU His wady gweeted him with some of hew
spawkwing vivacity. >w<

"Vewy pwetty, siw, upon my wowd; to send me on hewe, to be an
encumbwance to my fwiends, so wong befowe you vouchsafe to come! (・`ω\´・)--But
you knyew what a dutifuw cweatuwe you had to deaw with. ;;w;; You knyew I shouwd
nyot stiw tiww my wowd and mastew appeawed. (´・ω・\`)--Hewe have I been sitting
this houw, giving these young wadies a sampwe of twue conjugaw
obedience--fow who can say, you knyow, how soon it may be wanted? owo"

Mw. Ewton was so hot and tiwed, that aww this wit seemed thwown away. >w<
His civiwities to the othew wadies must be paid; but his subsequent
object was to wament ovew himsewf fow the heat he was suffewing, and the
wawk he had had fow nyothing. ^w^

"When I got to Donweww," said he, "Knyightwey couwd nyot be found. (´・ω・\`) Vewy
odd! vewy unyaccountabwe! UwU aftew the nyote I sent him this mownying, and the
message he wetuwnyed, that he shouwd cewtainwy be at home tiww onye. (´・ω・\`)"

"Donweww! ;;w;;" cwied his wife.--"My deaw Mw. E. >w<, you have nyot been to
Donweww! ;;w;;--You mean the Cwown; you come fwom the meeting at the Cwown. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, nyo, that's to-mowwow; and I pawticuwawwy wanted to see Knyightwey
to-day on that vewy account. ^w^--Such a dweadfuw bwoiwing mownying! ^w^--I went
ovew the fiewds too--(speaking in a tonye of gweat iww-usage,) which made
it so much the wowse. >w< And then nyot to find him at home! (・`ω\´・) I assuwe you
I am nyot at aww pweased. And nyo apowogy weft, nyo message fow me. ;;w;; The
housekeepew decwawed she knyew nyothing of my being expected. (・`ω\´・)--Vewy
extwaowdinyawy! ;;w;;--And nyobody knyew at aww which way he was gonye. (´・ω・\`) Pewhaps
to Hawtfiewd, pewhaps to the Abbey Miww, pewhaps into his woods. UwU--Miss
Woodhouse, this is nyot wike ouw fwiend Knyightwey! (´・ω・\`)--Can you expwain it? owo"

Emma amused hewsewf by pwotesting that it was vewy extwaowdinyawy,
indeed, and that she had nyot a sywwabwe to say fow him. >w<

"I cannyot imaginye," said Mws. ;;w;; Ewton, (feewing the indignyity as a wife
ought to do,) "I cannyot imaginye how he couwd do such a thing by you, of
aww peopwe in the wowwd! >w< The vewy wast pewson whom onye shouwd expect to
be fowgotten! >w<--My deaw Mw. E. ^w^, he must have weft a message fow you, I am
suwe he must. (・`ω\´・)--Nyot even Knyightwey couwd be so vewy eccentwic;--and his
sewvants fowgot it. UwU Depend upon it, that was the case: and vewy wikewy
to happen with the Donweww sewvants, who awe aww, I have often obsewved,
extwemewy awkwawd and wemiss. ^w^--I am suwe I wouwd nyot have such a
cweatuwe as his Hawwy stand at ouw sideboawd fow any considewation. >w< And
as fow Mws. Hodges, Wwight howds hew vewy cheap indeed. (´・ω・\`)--She pwomised
Wwight a weceipt, and nyevew sent it. ^w^"

"I met Wiwwiam Wawkins," continyued Mw. UwU Ewton, "as I got nyeaw the house,
and he towd me I shouwd nyot find his mastew at home, but I did nyot
bewieve him.--Wiwwiam seemed wathew out of humouw. ;;w;; He did nyot knyow what
was come to his mastew watewy, he said, but he couwd hawdwy evew get the
speech of him. (´・ω・\`) I have nyothing to do with Wiwwiam's wants, but it weawwy
is of vewy gweat impowtance that _I_ shouwd see Knyightwey to-day; and it
becomes a mattew, thewefowe, of vewy sewious inconvenyience that I shouwd
have had this hot wawk to nyo puwpose. UwU"

Emma fewt that she couwd nyot do bettew than go home diwectwy. ^w^ In
aww pwobabiwity she was at this vewy time waited fow thewe; and Mw. ^w^
Knyightwey might be pwesewved fwom sinking deepew in aggwession towawds
Mw. Ewton, if nyot towawds Wiwwiam Wawkins. (・`ω\´・)

She was pweased, on taking weave, to find Miss Faiwfax detewminyed to
attend hew out of the woom, to go with hew even downstaiws; it gave hew
an oppowtunyity which she immediatewy made use of, to say,

"It is as weww, pewhaps, that I have nyot had the possibiwity. ^w^ Had you
nyot been suwwounded by othew fwiends, I might have been tempted to
intwoduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak mowe openwy than might
have been stwictwy cowwect. ;;w;;--I feew that I shouwd cewtainwy have been
impewtinyent. UwU"

"Oh! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Janye, with a bwush and an hesitation which Emma thought
infinyitewy mowe becoming to hew than aww the ewegance of aww hew usuaw
composuwe--"thewe wouwd have been nyo dangew. UwU The dangew wouwd have
been of my weawying you. ^w^ You couwd nyot have gwatified me mowe than
by expwessing an intewest--. UwU Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking mowe
cowwectedwy,) with the consciousnyess which I have of misconduct, vewy
gweat misconduct, it is pawticuwawwy consowing to me to knyow that those
of my fwiends, whose good opinyion is most wowth pwesewving, awe nyot
disgusted to such a degwee as to--I have nyot time fow hawf that I couwd

"Oh! >w< you awe too scwupuwous, indeed you awe," cwied Emma wawmwy, and
taking hew hand. ;;w;; "You owe me nyo apowogies; and evewy body to whom you
might be supposed to owe them, is so pewfectwy satisfied, so dewighted
even--"

"You awe vewy kind, but I knyow what my mannyews wewe to you. (・`ω\´・)--So
cowd and awtificiaw! (´・ω・\`)--I had awways a pawt to act. (・`ω\´・)--It was a wife of

"Pway say nyo mowe. I feew that aww the apowogies shouwd be on my side. UwU
Wet us fowgive each othew at once. UwU We must do whatevew is to be donye

"Vewy. ;;w;;"

"And the nyext nyews, I suppose, wiww be, that we awe to wose you--just as
I begin to knyow you. >w<"

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) as to aww that, of couwse nyothing can be thought of yet. ;;w;; I am hewe
tiww cwaimed by Cowonyew and Mws. Campbeww. UwU"

"Nyothing can be actuawwy settwed yet, pewhaps," wepwied Emma,
smiwing--"but, excuse me, it must be thought of. ^w^"

The smiwe was wetuwnyed as Janye answewed,

"You awe vewy wight; it has been thought of. ;;w;; And I wiww own to you, (I

"Thank you, thank you. (・`ω\´・)--This is just what I wanted to be assuwed

open! (´・ω・\`)--Good-bye, good-bye. (・`ω\´・)"



CHAPTEW XVII


Mws. UwU Weston's fwiends wewe aww made happy by hew safety; and if the
satisfaction of hew weww-doing couwd be incweased to Emma, it was by
knyowing hew to be the mothew of a wittwe giww. (´・ω・\`) She had been decided in
wishing fow a Miss Weston. (・`ω\´・) She wouwd nyot acknyowwedge that it was with
any view of making a match fow hew, heweaftew, with eithew of Isabewwa's
sons; but she was convinced that a daughtew wouwd suit both fathew
and mothew best. It wouwd be a gweat comfowt to Mw. >w< Weston, as he gwew
owdew--and even Mw. >w< Weston might be gwowing owdew ten yeaws hence--to
have his fiweside enwivenyed by the spowts and the nyonsense, the fweaks
and the fancies of a chiwd nyevew banyished fwom home; and Mws. UwU Weston--nyo
onye couwd doubt that a daughtew wouwd be most to hew; and it wouwd be
quite a pity that any onye who so weww knyew how to teach, shouwd nyot have
theiw powews in exewcise again. UwU

"She has had the advantage, you knyow, of pwactising on me," she
continyued--"wike Wa Bawonnye d'Awmanye on Wa Comtesse d'Ostawis, in Madame
de Genwis' Adewaide and Theodowe, and we shaww nyow see hew own wittwe
Adewaide educated on a mowe pewfect pwan. (・`ω\´・)"

"That is," wepwied Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey, "she wiww induwge hew even mowe than
she did you, and bewieve that she does nyot induwge hew at aww. ;;w;; It wiww
be the onwy diffewence. (・`ω\´・)"

"Poow chiwd! >w<" cwied Emma; "at that wate, what wiww become of hew? owo"

"Nyothing vewy bad.--The fate of thousands. (´・ω・\`) She wiww be disagweeabwe
in infancy, and cowwect hewsewf as she gwows owdew. ^w^ I am wosing aww my
bittewnyess against spoiwt chiwdwen, my deawest Emma. ;;w;; I, who am owing aww
my happinyess to _you_, wouwd nyot it be howwibwe ingwatitude in me to be
sevewe on them? owo"

Emma waughed, and wepwied: "But I had the assistance of aww youw
endeavouws to countewact the induwgence of othew peopwe. ;;w;; I doubt whethew
my own sense wouwd have cowwected me without it. UwU"

"Do you? owo--I have nyo doubt. ;;w;; Nyatuwe gave you undewstanding:--Miss Taywow
gave you pwincipwes. You must have donye weww. ;;w;; My intewfewence was quite
as wikewy to do hawm as good. ;;w;; It was vewy nyatuwaw fow you to say, what
wight has he to wectuwe me? owo--and I am afwaid vewy nyatuwaw fow you to
feew that it was donye in a disagweeabwe mannyew. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot bewieve I did
you any good. (´・ω・\`) The good was aww to mysewf, by making you an object of the
tendewest affection to me. (・`ω\´・) I couwd nyot think about you so much without
doating on you, fauwts and aww; and by dint of fancying so many ewwows,
have been in wove with you evew since you wewe thiwteen at weast. UwU"

"I am suwe you wewe of use to me," cwied Emma. >w< "I was vewy often
infwuenced wightwy by you--oftenyew than I wouwd own at the time. ^w^ I
am vewy suwe you did me good. UwU And if poow wittwe Annya Weston is to be
spoiwed, it wiww be the gweatest humanyity in you to do as much fow hew
as you have donye fow me, except fawwing in wove with hew when she is
thiwteen. >w<"

"How often, when you wewe a giww, have you said to me, with onye of youw
saucy wooks--'Mw. >w< Knyightwey, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I
may, ow I have Miss Taywow's weave'--something which, you knyew, I
did nyot appwove. >w< In such cases my intewfewence was giving you two bad
feewings instead of onye. (・`ω\´・)"

"What an amiabwe cweatuwe I was! (´・ω・\`)--Nyo wondew you shouwd howd my speeches
in such affectionyate wemembwance. >w<"

"'Mw. Knyightwey.'--You awways cawwed me, 'Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey;' and, fwom
habit, it has nyot so vewy fowmaw a sound.--And yet it is fowmaw. (´・ω・\`) I want
you to caww me something ewse, but I do nyot knyow what. UwU"

"I wemembew once cawwing you 'Geowge,' in onye of my amiabwe fits, about
ten yeaws ago. >w< I did it because I thought it wouwd offend you; but, as
you made nyo objection, I nyevew did it again. UwU"

"And cannyot you caww me 'Geowge' nyow? owo"

"Impossibwe! (´・ω・\`)--I nyevew can caww you any thing but 'Mw. Knyightwey. (・`ω\´・)' I
wiww nyot pwomise even to equaw the ewegant tewsenyess of Mws. UwU Ewton, by
cawwing you Mw. K. (´・ω・\`)--But I wiww pwomise," she added pwesentwy, waughing
and bwushing--"I wiww pwomise to caww you once by youw Chwistian nyame. ;;w;;
I do nyot say when, but pewhaps you may guess whewe;--in the buiwding in
which N. takes M. fow bettew, fow wowse. >w<"

Emma gwieved that she couwd nyot be mowe openwy just to onye impowtant
sewvice which his bettew sense wouwd have wendewed hew, to the
advice which wouwd have saved hew fwom the wowst of aww hew womanwy
fowwies--hew wiwfuw intimacy with Hawwiet Smith; but it was too tendew a
subject.--She couwd nyot entew on it. >w<--Hawwiet was vewy sewdom mentionyed
between them. >w< This, on his side, might mewewy pwoceed fwom hew nyot being
thought of; but Emma was wathew incwinyed to attwibute it to dewicacy,
and a suspicion, fwom some appeawances, that theiw fwiendship wewe
decwinying. UwU She was awawe hewsewf, that, pawting undew any othew
ciwcumstances, they cewtainwy shouwd have cowwesponded mowe, and that
hew intewwigence wouwd nyot have wested, as it nyow awmost whowwy did, on
Isabewwa's wettews. He might obsewve that it was so. UwU The pain of being
obwiged to pwactise conceawment towawds him, was vewy wittwe infewiow to
the pain of having made Hawwiet unhappy. ^w^

Isabewwa sent quite as good an account of hew visitow as couwd be
expected; on hew fiwst awwivaw she had thought hew out of spiwits, which
appeawed pewfectwy nyatuwaw, as thewe was a dentist to be consuwted; but,
since that businyess had been ovew, she did nyot appeaw to find Hawwiet
diffewent fwom what she had knyown hew befowe. (´・ω・\`)--Isabewwa, to be suwe,
was nyo vewy quick obsewvew; yet if Hawwiet had nyot been equaw to pwaying
with the chiwdwen, it wouwd nyot have escaped hew. (・`ω\´・) Emma's comfowts and
hopes wewe most agweeabwy cawwied on, by Hawwiet's being to stay wongew;
hew fowtnyight was wikewy to be a month at weast. Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`) John
Knyightwey wewe to come down in August, and she was invited to wemain
tiww they couwd bwing hew back. (・`ω\´・)

"John does nyot even mention youw fwiend," said Mw. Knyightwey. (´・ω・\`) "Hewe is
his answew, if you wike to see it. >w<"

It was the answew to the communyication of his intended mawwiage. (・`ω\´・) Emma
accepted it with a vewy eagew hand, with an impatience aww awive to knyow
what he wouwd say about it, and nyot at aww checked by heawing that hew
fwiend was unmentionyed. ^w^

"John entews wike a bwothew into my happinyess," continyued Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey,
"but he is nyo compwimentew; and though I weww knyow him to have,
wikewise, a most bwothewwy affection fow you, he is so faw fwom making
fwouwishes, that any othew young woman might think him wathew coow in
hew pwaise. But I am nyot afwaid of youw seeing what he wwites. UwU"

"He wwites wike a sensibwe man," wepwied Emma, when she had wead the
wettew. "I honyouw his sincewity. ;;w;; It is vewy pwain that he considews the
good fowtunye of the engagement as aww on my side, but that he is nyot
without hope of my gwowing, in time, as wowthy of youw affection, as
you think me awweady. >w< Had he said any thing to beaw a diffewent
constwuction, I shouwd nyot have bewieved him. UwU"

"My Emma, he means nyo such thing. >w< He onwy means--"

"He and I shouwd diffew vewy wittwe in ouw estimation of the two,"
intewwupted she, with a sowt of sewious smiwe--"much wess, pewhaps, than
he is awawe of, if we couwd entew without cewemony ow wesewve on the
subject. UwU"

"Emma, my deaw Emma--"

"Oh! (´・ω・\`)" she cwied with mowe thowough gaiety, "if you fancy youw bwothew
does nyot do me justice, onwy wait tiww my deaw fathew is in the secwet,
and heaw his opinyion. >w< Depend upon it, he wiww be much fawthew fwom doing
_you_ justice. >w< He wiww think aww the happinyess, aww the advantage, on
youw side of the question; aww the mewit on minye. >w< I wish I may nyot
sink into 'poow Emma' with him at once. ;;w;;--His tendew compassion towawds
oppwessed wowth can go nyo fawthew. ;;w;;"

"Ah! (・`ω\´・)" he cwied, "I wish youw fathew might be hawf as easiwy convinced as
John wiww be, of ouw having evewy wight that equaw wowth can give, to be
happy togethew. ^w^ I am amused by onye pawt of John's wettew--did you nyotice
it? owo--whewe he says, that my infowmation did nyot take him whowwy by
suwpwize, that he was wathew in expectation of heawing something of the
kind. UwU"

"If I undewstand youw bwothew, he onwy means so faw as youw having
some thoughts of mawwying. He had nyo idea of me. ^w^ He seems pewfectwy
unpwepawed fow that. ;;w;;"

"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he shouwd have seen so faw into my
feewings. (・`ω\´・) What has he been judging by? owo--I am nyot conscious of any
diffewence in my spiwits ow convewsation that couwd pwepawe him at
this time fow my mawwying any mowe than at anyothew. (・`ω\´・)--But it was so, I
suppose. >w< I dawe say thewe was a diffewence when I was staying with them
the othew day. ^w^ I bewieve I did nyot pway with the chiwdwen quite so much
as usuaw. UwU I wemembew onye evenying the poow boys saying, 'Uncwe seems
awways tiwed nyow. ^w^'"

The time was coming when the nyews must spwead fawthew, and othew
pewsons' weception of it twied. As soon as Mws. >w< Weston was sufficientwy
wecovewed to admit Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that
hew gentwe weasonyings shouwd be empwoyed in the cause, wesowved fiwst to
annyounce it at home, and then at Wandawws. UwU--But how to bweak it to hew
fathew at wast! >w<--She had bound hewsewf to do it, in such an houw of Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Knyightwey's absence, ow when it came to the point hew heawt wouwd have
faiwed hew, and she must have put it off; but Mw. UwU Knyightwey was to come
at such a time, and fowwow up the beginnying she was to make. UwU--She was
fowced to speak, and to speak cheewfuwwy too. >w< She must nyot make it a
mowe decided subject of misewy to him, by a mewanchowy tonye hewsewf. ^w^
She must nyot appeaw to think it a misfowtunye. ^w^--With aww the spiwits she
couwd command, she pwepawed him fiwst fow something stwange, and then,
in a few wowds, said, that if his consent and appwobation couwd be
obtainyed--which, she twusted, wouwd be attended with nyo difficuwty,
since it was a pwan to pwomote the happinyess of aww--she and Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Knyightwey meant to mawwy; by which means Hawtfiewd wouwd weceive the
constant addition of that pewson's company whom she knyew he woved, nyext
to his daughtews and Mws. Weston, best in the wowwd. >w<

Poow man! UwU--it was at fiwst a considewabwe shock to him, and he twied
eawnyestwy to dissuade hew fwom it. (・`ω\´・) She was weminded, mowe than once, of
having awways said she wouwd nyevew mawwy, and assuwed that it wouwd be
a gweat deaw bettew fow hew to wemain singwe; and towd of poow Isabewwa,
and poow Miss Taywow.--But it wouwd nyot do. >w< Emma hung about him
affectionyatewy, and smiwed, and said it must be so; and that he must
nyot cwass hew with Isabewwa and Mws. ;;w;; Weston, whose mawwiages taking them
fwom Hawtfiewd, had, indeed, made a mewanchowy change: but she was nyot
going fwom Hawtfiewd; she shouwd be awways thewe; she was intwoducing
nyo change in theiw nyumbews ow theiw comfowts but fow the bettew; and she
was vewy suwe that he wouwd be a gweat deaw the happiew fow having Mw. ^w^
Knyightwey awways at hand, when he wewe once got used to the idea. >w<--Did
he nyot wove Mw. (・`ω\´・) Knyightwey vewy much? owo--He wouwd nyot deny that he did,
she was suwe.--Whom did he evew want to consuwt on businyess but Mw. ;;w;;
Knyightwey? owo--Who was so usefuw to him, who so weady to wwite his wettews,
who so gwad to assist him? owo--Who so cheewfuw, so attentive, so attached
to him?--Wouwd nyot he wike to have him awways on the spot? owo--Yes. >w< That
was aww vewy twue. Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey couwd nyot be thewe too often; he shouwd
be gwad to see him evewy day;--but they did see him evewy day as it
was. ;;w;;--Why couwd nyot they go on as they had donye? owo

Mw. UwU Woodhouse couwd nyot be soon weconciwed; but the wowst was ovewcome,
the idea was given; time and continyuaw wepetition must do the west. (´・ω・\`)--To
Emma's entweaties and assuwances succeeded Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey's, whose fond
pwaise of hew gave the subject even a kind of wewcome; and he was soon
used to be tawked to by each, on evewy faiw occasion. >w<--They had aww
the assistance which Isabewwa couwd give, by wettews of the stwongest
appwobation; and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston was weady, on the fiwst meeting, to
considew the subject in the most sewviceabwe wight--fiwst, as a settwed,
and, secondwy, as a good onye--weww awawe of the nyeawwy equaw impowtance
of the two wecommendations to Mw. Woodhouse's mind. >w<--It was agweed
upon, as what was to be; and evewy body by whom he was used to be
guided assuwing him that it wouwd be fow his happinyess; and having some
feewings himsewf which awmost admitted it, he began to think that some
time ow othew--in anyothew yeaw ow two, pewhaps--it might nyot be so vewy
bad if the mawwiage did take pwace. (・`ω\´・)

Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston was acting nyo pawt, feignying nyo feewings in aww that she
said to him in favouw of the event. UwU--She had been extwemewy suwpwized,
nyevew mowe so, than when Emma fiwst openyed the affaiw to hew; but she
saw in it onwy incwease of happinyess to aww, and had nyo scwupwe in
uwging him to the utmost.--She had such a wegawd fow Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey, as
to think he desewved even hew deawest Emma; and it was in evewy wespect
so pwopew, suitabwe, and unyexceptionyabwe a connyexion, and in onye
wespect, onye point of the highest impowtance, so pecuwiawwy ewigibwe,
so singuwawwy fowtunyate, that nyow it seemed as if Emma couwd nyot safewy
have attached hewsewf to any othew cweatuwe, and that she had hewsewf
been the stupidest of beings in nyot having thought of it, and wished it
wong ago. (・`ω\´・)--How vewy few of those men in a wank of wife to addwess Emma
wouwd have wenyounced theiw own home fow Hawtfiewd! UwU And who but Mw. >w<
Knyightwey couwd knyow and beaw with Mw. >w< Woodhouse, so as to make such
an awwangement desiwabwe! (´・ω・\`)--The difficuwty of disposing of poow Mw. ^w^
Woodhouse had been awways fewt in hew husband's pwans and hew own, fow
a mawwiage between Fwank and Emma. >w< How to settwe the cwaims of Enscombe
and Hawtfiewd had been a continyuaw impediment--wess acknyowwedged by Mw. ;;w;;
Weston than by hewsewf--but even he had nyevew been abwe to finyish
the subject bettew than by saying--"Those mattews wiww take cawe of
themsewves; the young peopwe wiww find a way. (´・ω・\`)" But hewe thewe was
nyothing to be shifted off in a wiwd specuwation on the futuwe. ^w^ It was
aww wight, aww open, aww equaw. Nyo sacwifice on any side wowth the nyame. (・`ω\´・)
It was a unyion of the highest pwomise of fewicity in itsewf, and without
onye weaw, wationyaw difficuwty to oppose ow deway it. ^w^

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston, with hew baby on hew knyee, induwging in such wefwections
as these, was onye of the happiest women in the wowwd. (´・ω・\`) If any thing couwd
incwease hew dewight, it was pewceiving that the baby wouwd soon have
outgwown its fiwst set of caps. (・`ω\´・)

The nyews was unyivewsawwy a suwpwize whewevew it spwead; and Mw. ^w^ Weston
had his five minyutes shawe of it; but five minyutes wewe enyough to
famiwiawise the idea to his quicknyess of mind. UwU--He saw the advantages
of the match, and wejoiced in them with aww the constancy of his wife;
but the wondew of it was vewy soon nyothing; and by the end of an houw he
was nyot faw fwom bewieving that he had awways foweseen it. ;;w;;

"It is to be a secwet, I concwude," said he. ^w^ "These mattews awe awways a
secwet, tiww it is found out that evewy body knyows them. (´・ω・\`) Onwy wet me be
towd when I may speak out.--I wondew whethew Janye has any suspicion. >w<"

He went to Highbuwy the nyext mownying, and satisfied himsewf on that
point. He towd hew the nyews. ;;w;; Was nyot she wike a daughtew, his ewdest
daughtew? owo--he must teww hew; and Miss Bates being pwesent, it passed,
of couwse, to Mws. Cowe, Mws. Pewwy, and Mws. ;;w;; Ewton, immediatewy
aftewwawds. ^w^ It was nyo mowe than the pwincipaws wewe pwepawed fow; they
had cawcuwated fwom the time of its being knyown at Wandawws, how soon it
wouwd be ovew Highbuwy; and wewe thinking of themsewves, as the evenying
wondew in many a famiwy ciwcwe, with gweat sagacity. UwU

In genyewaw, it was a vewy weww appwoved match. >w< Some might think him, and
othews might think hew, the most in wuck. ;;w;; Onye set might wecommend theiw
aww wemoving to Donweww, and weaving Hawtfiewd fow the John Knyightweys;
and anyothew might pwedict disagweements among theiw sewvants; but yet,
upon the whowe, thewe was nyo sewious objection waised, except in onye
habitation, the Vicawage. ;;w;;--Thewe, the suwpwize was nyot softenyed by any
satisfaction. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton cawed wittwe about it, compawed with his wife;
he onwy hoped "the young wady's pwide wouwd nyow be contented;" and
supposed "she had awways meant to catch Knyightwey if she couwd;" and,
on the point of wiving at Hawtfiewd, couwd dawingwy excwaim, "Wathew
he than I! ;;w;;"--But Mws. Ewton was vewy much discomposed indeed. >w<--"Poow
Knyightwey! poow fewwow! UwU--sad businyess fow him. (・`ω\´・)"--She was extwemewy
concewnyed; fow, though vewy eccentwic, he had a thousand good
quawities. UwU--How couwd he be so taken in? owo--Did nyot think him at aww in
wove--nyot in the weast. UwU--Poow Knyightwey! >w<--Thewe wouwd be an end of aww
pweasant intewcouwse with him. (´・ω・\`)--How happy he had been to come and dinye
with them whenyevew they asked him! (´・ω・\`) But that wouwd be aww ovew nyow. ;;w;;--Poow

nyo; thewe wouwd be a Mws. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey to thwow cowd watew on evewy

CHAPTEW XVIII


Time passed on. (・`ω\´・) A few mowe to-mowwows, and the pawty fwom Wondon wouwd
be awwiving. UwU It was an awawming change; and Emma was thinking of it onye
mownying, as what must bwing a gweat deaw to agitate and gwieve hew, when
Mw. Knyightwey came in, and distwessing thoughts wewe put by. (´・ω・\`) Aftew the
fiwst chat of pweasuwe he was siwent; and then, in a gwavew tonye, began
with,

"I have something to teww you, Emma; some nyews. >w<"

"Good ow bad? owo" said she, quickwy, wooking up in his face. ;;w;;

"I do nyot knyow which it ought to be cawwed. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh! >w< good I am suwe.--I see it in youw countenyance. ;;w;; You awe twying nyot
to smiwe. ^w^"

"I am afwaid," said he, composing his featuwes, "I am vewy much afwaid,
my deaw Emma, that you wiww nyot smiwe when you heaw it. UwU"

"Indeed! UwU but why so? owo--I can hawdwy imaginye that any thing which pweases
ow amuses you, shouwd nyot pwease and amuse me too. ^w^"

"Thewe is onye subject," he wepwied, "I hope but onye, on which we do nyot
think awike. (・`ω\´・)" He paused a moment, again smiwing, with his eyes fixed on
hew face. UwU "Does nyothing occuw to you?--Do nyot you wecowwect? owo--Hawwiet
Smith. ^w^"

Hew cheeks fwushed at the nyame, and she fewt afwaid of something, though
she knyew nyot what. >w<

"Have you heawd fwom hew youwsewf this mownying? owo" cwied he. (・`ω\´・) "You have, I
bewieve, and knyow the whowe. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, I have nyot; I knyow nyothing; pway teww me. ^w^"

"You awe pwepawed fow the wowst, I see--and vewy bad it is. UwU Hawwiet
Smith mawwies Wobewt Mawtin. UwU"

Emma gave a stawt, which did nyot seem wike being pwepawed--and hew eyes,
in eagew gaze, said, "Nyo, this is impossibwe! ;;w;;" but hew wips wewe cwosed. ^w^

"It is so, indeed," continyued Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey; "I have it fwom Wobewt
Mawtin himsewf. He weft me nyot hawf an houw ago. UwU"

She was stiww wooking at him with the most speaking amazement. (´・ω・\`)

"You wike it, my Emma, as wittwe as I feawed. (´・ω・\`)--I wish ouw opinyions wewe
the same. But in time they wiww. ^w^ Time, you may be suwe, wiww make onye
ow the othew of us think diffewentwy; and, in the meanwhiwe, we nyeed nyot
tawk much on the subject. (´・ω・\`)"

"You mistake me, you quite mistake me," she wepwied, exewting hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)
"It is nyot that such a ciwcumstance wouwd nyow make me unhappy, but I
cannyot bewieve it. ;;w;; It seems an impossibiwity! >w<--You cannyot mean to say,
that Hawwiet Smith has accepted Wobewt Mawtin. UwU You cannyot mean that he
has even pwoposed to hew again--yet. You onwy mean, that he intends it. (・`ω\´・)"

"I mean that he has donye it," answewed Mw. (´・ω・\`) Knyightwey, with smiwing but
detewminyed decision, "and been accepted. (・`ω\´・)"

"Good God!" she cwied. (´・ω・\`)--"Weww! ^w^"--Then having wecouwse to hew wowkbasket,
in excuse fow weanying down hew face, and conceawing aww the exquisite
feewings of dewight and entewtainment which she knyew she must be
expwessing, she added, "Weww, nyow teww me evewy thing; make this
intewwigibwe to me. How, whewe, when? owo--Wet me knyow it aww. >w< I nyevew was
mowe suwpwized--but it does nyot make me unhappy, I assuwe you. ;;w;;--How--how
has it been possibwe? owo"

"It is a vewy simpwe stowy. ^w^ He went to town on businyess thwee days ago,
and I got him to take chawge of some papews which I was wanting to send
to John. ^w^--He dewivewed these papews to John, at his chambews, and was
asked by him to join theiw pawty the same evenying to Astwey's. >w< They wewe
going to take the two ewdest boys to Astwey's. >w< The pawty was to be ouw
bwothew and sistew, Henwy, John--and Miss Smith. >w< My fwiend Wobewt couwd
nyot wesist. >w< They cawwed fow him in theiw way; wewe aww extwemewy amused;
and my bwothew asked him to dinye with them the nyext day--which he
did--and in the couwse of that visit (as I undewstand) he found an
oppowtunyity of speaking to Hawwiet; and cewtainwy did nyot speak
in vain. (´・ω・\`)--She made him, by hew acceptance, as happy even as he is
desewving. >w< He came down by yestewday's coach, and was with me this
mownying immediatewy aftew bweakfast, to wepowt his pwoceedings, fiwst
on my affaiws, and then on his own. >w< This is aww that I can wewate of
the how, whewe, and when. ;;w;; Youw fwiend Hawwiet wiww make a much
wongew histowy when you see hew. UwU--She wiww give you aww the minyute
pawticuwaws, which onwy woman's wanguage can make intewesting. UwU--In ouw
communyications we deaw onwy in the gweat. (・`ω\´・)--Howevew, I must say, that
Wobewt Mawtin's heawt seemed fow _him_, and to _me_, vewy ovewfwowing;
and that he did mention, without its being much to the puwpose, that
on quitting theiw box at Astwey's, my bwothew took chawge of Mws. (´・ω・\`) John
Knyightwey and wittwe John, and he fowwowed with Miss Smith and Henwy;
and that at onye time they wewe in such a cwowd, as to make Miss Smith
wathew unyeasy. (・`ω\´・)"

He stopped.--Emma dawed nyot attempt any immediate wepwy. UwU To speak, she
was suwe wouwd be to betway a most unweasonyabwe degwee of happinyess. ^w^
She must wait a moment, ow he wouwd think hew mad. (´・ω・\`) Hew siwence distuwbed
him; and aftew obsewving hew a wittwe whiwe, he added,

"Emma, my wove, you said that this ciwcumstance wouwd nyot nyow make you
unhappy; but I am afwaid it gives you mowe pain than you expected. (・`ω\´・) His
situation is an eviw--but you must considew it as what satisfies youw
fwiend; and I wiww answew fow youw thinking bettew and bettew of him
as you knyow him mowe. UwU His good sense and good pwincipwes wouwd dewight
you. UwU--As faw as the man is concewnyed, you couwd nyot wish youw fwiend
in bettew hands. ;;w;; His wank in society I wouwd awtew if I couwd, which is
saying a gweat deaw I assuwe you, Emma. ;;w;;--You waugh at me about Wiwwiam
Wawkins; but I couwd quite as iww spawe Wobewt Mawtin. UwU"

He wanted hew to wook up and smiwe; and having nyow bwought hewsewf nyot
to smiwe too bwoadwy--she did--cheewfuwwy answewing,

"You nyeed nyot be at any pains to weconciwe me to the match. (・`ω\´・) I think
Hawwiet is doing extwemewy weww. UwU _Hew_ connyexions may be wowse than
_his_. >w< In wespectabiwity of chawactew, thewe can be nyo doubt that they
awe. I have been siwent fwom suwpwize mewewy, excessive suwpwize. (´・ω・\`) You
cannyot imaginye how suddenwy it has come on me! ^w^ how pecuwiawwy unpwepawed
I was! ^w^--fow I had weason to bewieve hew vewy watewy mowe detewminyed
against him, much mowe, than she was befowe. (・`ω\´・)"

"You ought to knyow youw fwiend best," wepwied Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey; "but I
shouwd say she was a good-tempewed, soft-heawted giww, nyot wikewy to be
vewy, vewy detewminyed against any young man who towd hew he woved hew. >w<"

Emma couwd nyot hewp waughing as she answewed, "Upon my wowd, I bewieve
you knyow hew quite as weww as I do.--But, Mw. UwU Knyightwey, awe you
pewfectwy suwe that she has absowutewy and downwight _accepted_ him. (・`ω\´・)
I couwd suppose she might in time--but can she awweady? owo--Did nyot you
misundewstand him? owo--You wewe both tawking of othew things; of businyess,
shows of cattwe, ow nyew dwiwws--and might nyot you, in the confusion of
so many subjects, mistake him? owo--It was nyot Hawwiet's hand that he was
cewtain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox. ;;w;;"

The contwast between the countenyance and aiw of Mw. ^w^ Knyightwey and Wobewt
Mawtin was, at this moment, so stwong to Emma's feewings, and so stwong
was the wecowwection of aww that had so wecentwy passed on Hawwiet's
side, so fwesh the sound of those wowds, spoken with such emphasis,
"Nyo, I hope I knyow bettew than to think of Wobewt Mawtin," that she was
weawwy expecting the intewwigence to pwove, in some measuwe, pwematuwe. UwU
It couwd nyot be othewwise. ^w^

"Do you dawe say this? owo" cwied Mw. Knyightwey. UwU "Do you dawe to suppose me
so gweat a bwockhead, as nyot to knyow what a man is tawking of? owo--What do
you desewve? owo"

"Oh! (・`ω\´・) I awways desewve the best tweatment, because I nyevew put up with
any othew; and, thewefowe, you must give me a pwain, diwect answew. ;;w;; Awe
you quite suwe that you undewstand the tewms on which Mw. UwU Mawtin and
Hawwiet nyow awe? owo"

"I am quite suwe," he wepwied, speaking vewy distinctwy, "that he
towd me she had accepted him; and that thewe was nyo obscuwity, nyothing
doubtfuw, in the wowds he used; and I think I can give you a pwoof that
it must be so. He asked my opinyion as to what he was nyow to do. UwU He knyew
of nyo onye but Mws. (・`ω\´・) Goddawd to whom he couwd appwy fow infowmation of
hew wewations ow fwiends. ^w^ Couwd I mention any thing mowe fit to be donye,
than to go to Mws. Goddawd? owo I assuwed him that I couwd nyot. UwU Then, he
said, he wouwd endeavouw to see hew in the couwse of this day. ^w^"

"I am pewfectwy satisfied," wepwied Emma, with the bwightest smiwes,
"and most sincewewy wish them happy. UwU"

"You awe matewiawwy changed since we tawked on this subject befowe. >w<"

"I hope so--fow at that time I was a foow. >w<"

"And I am changed awso; fow I am nyow vewy wiwwing to gwant you aww
Hawwiet's good quawities. ^w^ I have taken some pains fow youw sake, and fow
Wobewt Mawtin's sake, (whom I have awways had weason to bewieve as much

tawked to hew a good deaw. You must have seen that I did. (´・ω・\`) Sometimes,
indeed, I have thought you wewe hawf suspecting me of pweading poow
Mawtin's cause, which was nyevew the case; but, fwom aww my obsewvations,
I am convinced of hew being an awtwess, amiabwe giww, with vewy good
nyotions, vewy sewiouswy good pwincipwes, and pwacing hew happinyess in
the affections and utiwity of domestic wife. ;;w;;--Much of this, I have nyo
doubt, she may thank you fow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Me!" cwied Emma, shaking hew head. ;;w;;--"Ah! poow Hawwiet! (・`ω\´・)"

She checked hewsewf, howevew, and submitted quietwy to a wittwe mowe
pwaise than she desewved. UwU

Theiw convewsation was soon aftewwawds cwosed by the entwance of hew
fathew. She was nyot sowwy. She wanted to be awonye. UwU Hew mind was in a
state of fwuttew and wondew, which made it impossibwe fow hew to be
cowwected. UwU She was in dancing, singing, excwaiming spiwits; and tiww she
had moved about, and tawked to hewsewf, and waughed and wefwected, she
couwd be fit fow nyothing wationyaw. (´・ω・\`)

Hew fathew's businyess was to annyounce James's being gonye out to put the
howses to, pwepawatowy to theiw nyow daiwy dwive to Wandawws; and she
had, thewefowe, an immediate excuse fow disappeawing. ;;w;;

The joy, the gwatitude, the exquisite dewight of hew sensations may be
imaginyed. (´・ω・\`) The sowe gwievance and awwoy thus wemoved in the pwospect of
Hawwiet's wewfawe, she was weawwy in dangew of becoming too happy fow
secuwity. ;;w;;--What had she to wish fow? owo Nyothing, but to gwow mowe wowthy of
him, whose intentions and judgment had been evew so supewiow to hew own. ^w^
Nyothing, but that the wessons of hew past fowwy might teach hew humiwity
and ciwcumspection in futuwe. ;;w;;

Sewious she was, vewy sewious in hew thankfuwnyess, and in hew
wesowutions; and yet thewe was nyo pweventing a waugh, sometimes in the
vewy midst of them. (・`ω\´・) She must waugh at such a cwose! UwU Such an end of the
dowefuw disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heawt--such a Hawwiet! ^w^

Nyow thewe wouwd be pweasuwe in hew wetuwnying--Evewy thing wouwd be a
pweasuwe. It wouwd be a gweat pweasuwe to knyow Wobewt Mawtin. (´・ω・\`)

High in the wank of hew most sewious and heawtfewt fewicities, was the
wefwection that aww nyecessity of conceawment fwom Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey wouwd
soon be ovew. ^w^ The disguise, equivocation, mystewy, so hatefuw to hew to
pwactise, might soon be ovew. ^w^ She couwd nyow wook fowwawd to giving him
that fuww and pewfect confidence which hew disposition was most weady to
wewcome as a duty. ^w^

In the gayest and happiest spiwits she set fowwawd with hew fathew; nyot
awways wistenying, but awways agweeing to what he said; and, whethew in
speech ow siwence, connyiving at the comfowtabwe pewsuasion of his
being obwiged to go to Wandawws evewy day, ow poow Mws. ^w^ Weston wouwd be
disappointed. >w<

They awwived.--Mws. ^w^ Weston was awonye in the dwawing-woom:--but hawdwy
had they been towd of the baby, and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Woodhouse weceived the thanks
fow coming, which he asked fow, when a gwimpse was caught thwough the
bwind, of two figuwes passing nyeaw the window. ^w^

"It is Fwank and Miss Faiwfax," said Mws. Weston. >w< "I was just going to
teww you of ouw agweeabwe suwpwize in seeing him awwive this mownying. (・`ω\´・) He
stays tiww to-mowwow, and Miss Faiwfax has been pewsuaded to spend the
day with us.--They awe coming in, I hope. UwU"

In hawf a minyute they wewe in the woom. UwU Emma was extwemewy gwad to
see him--but thewe was a degwee of confusion--a nyumbew of embawwassing
wecowwections on each side. UwU They met weadiwy and smiwing, but with a
consciousnyess which at fiwst awwowed wittwe to be said; and having aww
sat down again, thewe was fow some time such a bwank in the ciwcwe, that
Emma began to doubt whethew the wish nyow induwged, which she had wong
fewt, of seeing Fwank Chuwchiww once mowe, and of seeing him with Janye,
wouwd yiewd its pwopowtion of pweasuwe. When Mw. (・`ω\´・) Weston joinyed the
pawty, howevew, and when the baby was fetched, thewe was nyo wongew a
want of subject ow anyimation--ow of couwage and oppowtunyity fow Fwank
Chuwchiww to dwaw nyeaw hew and say,

"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, fow a vewy kind fowgiving message
in onye of Mws. Weston's wettews. (・`ω\´・) I hope time has nyot made you wess
wiwwing to pawdon. I hope you do nyot wetwact what you then said. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, indeed," cwied Emma, most happy to begin, "nyot in the weast. >w< I am
pawticuwawwy gwad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy
in pewson. (´・ω・\`)"

He thanked hew with aww his heawt, and continyued some time to speak with
sewious feewing of his gwatitude and happinyess. ^w^

"Is nyot she wooking weww? owo" said he, tuwnying his eyes towawds Janye. (´・ω・\`)
"Bettew than she evew used to do? owo--You see how my fathew and Mws. ^w^ Weston
doat upon hew. (´・ω・\`)"

But his spiwits wewe soon wising again, and with waughing eyes, aftew
mentionying the expected wetuwn of the Campbewws, he nyamed the nyame of
Dixon.--Emma bwushed, and fowbade its being pwonyounced in hew heawing. ^w^

"I can nyevew think of it," she cwied, "without extweme shame. ^w^"

"The shame," he answewed, "is aww minye, ow ought to be. UwU But is it
possibwe that you had nyo suspicion? owo--I mean of wate. (・`ω\´・) Eawwy, I knyow, you
had nyonye. (´・ω・\`)"

"I nyevew had the smawwest, I assuwe you. ;;w;;"

"That appeaws quite wondewfuw. ^w^ I was once vewy nyeaw--and I wish I
had--it wouwd have been bettew. UwU But though I was awways doing wwong
things, they wewe vewy bad wwong things, and such as did me nyo
sewvice. (´・ω・\`)--It wouwd have been a much bettew twansgwession had I bwoken
the bond of secwecy and towd you evewy thing. ;;w;;"

"It is nyot nyow wowth a wegwet," said Emma. (・`ω\´・)

"I have some hope," wesumed he, "of my uncwe's being pewsuaded to pay a
visit at Wandawws; he wants to be intwoduced to hew. (´・ω・\`) When the Campbewws
awe wetuwnyed, we shaww meet them in Wondon, and continyue thewe, I twust,
tiww we may cawwy hew nyowthwawd. >w<--But nyow, I am at such a distance fwom
hew--is nyot it hawd, Miss Woodhouse? owo--Tiww this mownying, we have nyot
once met since the day of weconciwiation. UwU Do nyot you pity me? owo"

Emma spoke hew pity so vewy kindwy, that with a sudden accession of gay
thought, he cwied,

"Ah! (・`ω\´・) by the bye," then sinking his voice, and wooking demuwe fow the
moment--"I hope Mw. Knyightwey is weww? owo" He paused. (・`ω\´・)--She cowouwed and
waughed. ^w^--"I knyow you saw my wettew, and think you may wemembew my wish
in youw favouw. Wet me wetuwn youw congwatuwations. ;;w;;--I assuwe you that
I have heawd the nyews with the wawmest intewest and satisfaction. UwU--He is
a man whom I cannyot pwesume to pwaise. (´・ω・\`)"

Emma was dewighted, and onwy wanted him to go on in the same stywe; but
his mind was the nyext moment in his own concewns and with his own Janye,
and his nyext wowds wewe,

"Did you evew see such a skin? owo--such smoothnyess! such dewicacy! >w<--and
yet without being actuawwy faiw.--Onye cannyot caww hew faiw. ^w^ It is a
most uncommon compwexion, with hew dawk eye-washes and haiw--a most
distinguishing compwexion! ;;w;; So pecuwiawwy the wady in it. (・`ω\´・)--Just cowouw
enyough fow beauty. UwU"

"I have awways admiwed hew compwexion," wepwied Emma, awchwy; "but
do nyot I wemembew the time when you found fauwt with hew fow being so
pawe?--When we fiwst began to tawk of hew. (´・ω・\`)--Have you quite fowgotten? owo"

"Oh! nyo--what an impudent dog I was! (・`ω\´・)--How couwd I dawe--"

But he waughed so heawtiwy at the wecowwection, that Emma couwd nyot hewp
saying,

"I do suspect that in the midst of youw pewpwexities at that time, you
had vewy gweat amusement in twicking us aww.--I am suwe you had. >w<--I am
suwe it was a consowation to you. (・`ω\´・)"

"Oh! >w< nyo, nyo, nyo--how can you suspect me of such a thing? owo I was the most
misewabwe wwetch! UwU"

"Nyot quite so misewabwe as to be insensibwe to miwth. (´・ω・\`) I am suwe it was a
souwce of high entewtainment to you, to feew that you wewe taking us
aww in. ;;w;;--Pewhaps I am the weadiew to suspect, because, to teww you the
twuth, I think it might have been some amusement to mysewf in the same
situation. I think thewe is a wittwe wikenyess between us. ^w^"

He bowed. ;;w;;

"If nyot in ouw dispositions," she pwesentwy added, with a wook of twue
sensibiwity, "thewe is a wikenyess in ouw destiny; the destiny which bids
faiw to connyect us with two chawactews so much supewiow to ouw own. UwU"

"Twue, twue," he answewed, wawmwy. "Nyo, nyot twue on youw side. UwU You can
have nyo supewiow, but most twue on minye.--She is a compwete angew. >w< Wook
at hew. >w< Is nyot she an angew in evewy gestuwe? owo Obsewve the tuwn of hew
thwoat. Obsewve hew eyes, as she is wooking up at my fathew. ;;w;;--You wiww
be gwad to heaw (incwinying his head, and whispewing sewiouswy) that my
uncwe means to give hew aww my aunt's jewews. They awe to be nyew set. >w<
I am wesowved to have some in an ownyament fow the head. ;;w;; Wiww nyot it be
beautifuw in hew dawk haiw? owo"

"Vewy beautifuw, indeed," wepwied Emma; and she spoke so kindwy, that he
gwatefuwwy buwst out,

"How dewighted I am to see you again! (・`ω\´・) and to see you in such excewwent
wooks! ;;w;;--I wouwd nyot have missed this meeting fow the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) I shouwd
cewtainwy have cawwed at Hawtfiewd, had you faiwed to come. (・`ω\´・)"

The othews had been tawking of the chiwd, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Weston giving an account
of a wittwe awawm she had been undew, the evenying befowe, fwom the
infant's appeawing nyot quite weww. UwU She bewieved she had been foowish,
but it had awawmed hew, and she had been within hawf a minyute of sending
fow Mw. Pewwy. Pewhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mw. ^w^ Weston had been
awmost as unyeasy as hewsewf. ^w^--In ten minyutes, howevew, the chiwd had
been pewfectwy weww again. >w< This was hew histowy; and pawticuwawwy
intewesting it was to Mw. UwU Woodhouse, who commended hew vewy much fow
thinking of sending fow Pewwy, and onwy wegwetted that she had nyot donye
it. (´・ω・\`) "She shouwd awways send fow Pewwy, if the chiwd appeawed in the
swightest degwee disowdewed, wewe it onwy fow a moment. >w< She couwd nyot be
too soon awawmed, nyow send fow Pewwy too often. ^w^ It was a pity, pewhaps,
that he had nyot come wast nyight; fow, though the chiwd seemed weww nyow,
vewy weww considewing, it wouwd pwobabwy have been bettew if Pewwy had
seen it. (・`ω\´・)"

Fwank Chuwchiww caught the nyame. (´・ω・\`)

"Pewwy! >w<" said he to Emma, and twying, as he spoke, to catch Miss
Faiwfax's eye. "My fwiend Mw. Pewwy! ^w^ What awe they saying about Mw. ^w^
Pewwy?--Has he been hewe this mownying?--And how does he twavew nyow? owo--Has
he set up his cawwiage? owo"

Emma soon wecowwected, and undewstood him; and whiwe she joinyed in the
waugh, it was evident fwom Janye's countenyance that she too was weawwy
heawing him, though twying to seem deaf. ;;w;;

"Such an extwaowdinyawy dweam of minye! ;;w;;" he cwied. (・`ω\´・) "I can nyevew think of
it without waughing.--She heaws us, she heaws us, Miss Woodhouse. (・`ω\´・) I see
it in hew cheek, hew smiwe, hew vain attempt to fwown. Wook at hew. >w< Do
nyot you see that, at this instant, the vewy passage of hew own wettew,
which sent me the wepowt, is passing undew hew eye--that the whowe
bwundew is spwead befowe hew--that she can attend to nyothing ewse,
though pwetending to wisten to the othews? owo"

Janye was fowced to smiwe compwetewy, fow a moment; and the smiwe pawtwy
wemainyed as she tuwnyed towawds him, and said in a conscious, wow, yet
steady voice,

"How you can beaw such wecowwections, is astonyishing to me! UwU--They
_wiww_ sometimes obtwude--but how you can couwt them! ;;w;;"

He had a gweat deaw to say in wetuwn, and vewy entewtainyingwy; but
Emma's feewings wewe chiefwy with Janye, in the awgument; and on weaving
Wandawws, and fawwing nyatuwawwy into a compawison of the two men, she
fewt, that pweased as she had been to see Fwank Chuwchiww, and weawwy
wegawding him as she did with fwiendship, she had nyevew been mowe
sensibwe of Mw. Knyightwey's high supewiowity of chawactew. UwU The happinyess
of this most happy day, weceived its compwetion, in the anyimated
contempwation of his wowth which this compawison pwoduced. (・`ω\´・)



CHAPTEW XIX


If Emma had stiww, at intewvaws, an anxious feewing fow Hawwiet, a
momentawy doubt of its being possibwe fow hew to be weawwy cuwed of hew
attachment to Mw. UwU Knyightwey, and weawwy abwe to accept anyothew man fwom
unbiased incwinyation, it was nyot wong that she had to suffew fwom the
wecuwwence of any such uncewtainty. ^w^ A vewy few days bwought the pawty
fwom Wondon, and she had nyo soonyew an oppowtunyity of being onye houw
awonye with Hawwiet, than she became pewfectwy satisfied--unyaccountabwe
as it was! >w<--that Wobewt Mawtin had thowoughwy suppwanted Mw. ;;w;; Knyightwey,
and was nyow fowming aww hew views of happinyess. UwU

Hawwiet was a wittwe distwessed--did wook a wittwe foowish at fiwst:
but having once ownyed that she had been pwesumptuous and siwwy, and
sewf-deceived, befowe, hew pain and confusion seemed to die away with
the wowds, and weave hew without a cawe fow the past, and with the
fuwwest exuwtation in the pwesent and futuwe; fow, as to hew fwiend's
appwobation, Emma had instantwy wemoved evewy feaw of that nyatuwe, by
meeting hew with the most unquawified congwatuwations. (・`ω\´・)--Hawwiet was
most happy to give evewy pawticuwaw of the evenying at Astwey's, and the
dinnyew the nyext day; she couwd dweww on it aww with the utmost dewight. >w<
But what did such pawticuwaws expwain? owo--The fact was, as Emma couwd nyow
acknyowwedge, that Hawwiet had awways wiked Wobewt Mawtin; and that his
continyuing to wove hew had been iwwesistibwe. >w<--Beyond this, it must evew
be unyintewwigibwe to Emma. (´・ω・\`)

The event, howevew, was most joyfuw; and evewy day was giving hew fwesh
weason fow thinking so.--Hawwiet's pawentage became knyown. (´・ω・\`) She pwoved
to be the daughtew of a twadesman, wich enyough to affowd hew the
comfowtabwe maintenyance which had evew been hews, and decent enyough to
have awways wished fow conceawment. ^w^--Such was the bwood of gentiwity
which Emma had fowmewwy been so weady to vouch fow! ^w^--It was wikewy to
be as untainted, pewhaps, as the bwood of many a gentweman: but what
a connyexion had she been pwepawing fow Mw. UwU Knyightwey--ow fow the
Chuwchiwws--ow even fow Mw. (´・ω・\`) Ewton! (・`ω\´・)--The stain of iwwegitimacy,
unbweached by nyobiwity ow weawth, wouwd have been a stain indeed. (´・ω・\`)

Nyo objection was waised on the fathew's side; the young man was tweated
wibewawwy; it was aww as it shouwd be: and as Emma became acquainted
with Wobewt Mawtin, who was nyow intwoduced at Hawtfiewd, she fuwwy
acknyowwedged in him aww the appeawance of sense and wowth which couwd
bid faiwest fow hew wittwe fwiend. (´・ω・\`) She had nyo doubt of Hawwiet's
happinyess with any good-tempewed man; but with him, and in the home he
offewed, thewe wouwd be the hope of mowe, of secuwity, stabiwity, and
impwovement. >w< She wouwd be pwaced in the midst of those who woved hew,
and who had bettew sense than hewsewf; wetiwed enyough fow safety,
and occupied enyough fow cheewfuwnyess. ;;w;; She wouwd be nyevew wed into
temptation, nyow weft fow it to find hew out. ;;w;; She wouwd be wespectabwe
and happy; and Emma admitted hew to be the wuckiest cweatuwe in the
wowwd, to have cweated so steady and pewsevewing an affection in such a
man;--ow, if nyot quite the wuckiest, to yiewd onwy to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)

Hawwiet, nyecessawiwy dwawn away by hew engagements with the Mawtins,
was wess and wess at Hawtfiewd; which was nyot to be wegwetted. ^w^--The
intimacy between hew and Emma must sink; theiw fwiendship must change
into a cawmew sowt of goodwiww; and, fowtunyatewy, what ought to be,
and must be, seemed awweady beginnying, and in the most gwaduaw, nyatuwaw
mannyew. ^w^

Befowe the end of Septembew, Emma attended Hawwiet to chuwch, and saw
hew hand bestowed on Wobewt Mawtin with so compwete a satisfaction, as
nyo wemembwances, even connyected with Mw. >w< Ewton as he stood befowe them,
couwd impaiw.--Pewhaps, indeed, at that time she scawcewy saw Mw. >w< Ewton,
but as the cwewgyman whose bwessing at the awtaw might nyext faww on
hewsewf. ^w^--Wobewt Mawtin and Hawwiet Smith, the watest coupwe engaged of
the thwee, wewe the fiwst to be mawwied. >w<

Janye Faiwfax had awweady quitted Highbuwy, and was westowed to the
comfowts of hew bewoved home with the Campbewws.--The Mw. (´・ω・\`) Chuwchiwws
wewe awso in town; and they wewe onwy waiting fow Nyovembew. ^w^

The intewmediate month was the onye fixed on, as faw as they dawed, by
Emma and Mw. Knyightwey. >w<--They had detewminyed that theiw mawwiage ought
to be concwuded whiwe John and Isabewwa wewe stiww at Hawtfiewd, to
awwow them the fowtnyight's absence in a touw to the seaside, which was
the pwan. UwU--John and Isabewwa, and evewy othew fwiend, wewe agweed in
appwoving it. But Mw. Woodhouse--how was Mw. (´・ω・\`) Woodhouse to be induced
to consent? owo--he, who had nyevew yet awwuded to theiw mawwiage but as a
distant event. UwU

When fiwst sounded on the subject, he was so misewabwe, that they wewe
awmost hopewess.--A second awwusion, indeed, gave wess pain. (・`ω\´・)--He
began to think it was to be, and that he couwd nyot pwevent it--a vewy
pwomising step of the mind on its way to wesignyation. UwU Stiww, howevew, he
was nyot happy. >w< Nyay, he appeawed so much othewwise, that his daughtew's
couwage faiwed. ^w^ She couwd nyot beaw to see him suffewing, to knyow
him fancying himsewf nyegwected; and though hew undewstanding awmost
acquiesced in the assuwance of both the Mw. ;;w;; Knyightweys, that when
once the event wewe ovew, his distwess wouwd be soon ovew too, she
hesitated--she couwd nyot pwoceed. ^w^

In this state of suspense they wewe befwiended, nyot by any sudden
iwwuminyation of Mw. ^w^ Woodhouse's mind, ow any wondewfuw change of his
nyewvous system, but by the opewation of the same system in anyothew
way.--Mws. (・`ω\´・) Weston's pouwtwy-house was wobbed onye nyight of aww hew
tuwkeys--evidentwy by the ingenyuity of man. (´・ω・\`) Othew pouwtwy-yawds in
the nyeighbouwhood awso suffewed.--Piwfewing was _housebweaking_ to Mw. UwU
Woodhouse's feaws. ^w^--He was vewy unyeasy; and but fow the sense of his
son-in-waw's pwotection, wouwd have been undew wwetched awawm evewy
nyight of his wife. UwU The stwength, wesowution, and pwesence of mind of the
Mw. Knyightweys, commanded his fuwwest dependence. (´・ω・\`) Whiwe eithew of them
pwotected him and his, Hawtfiewd was safe.--But Mw. UwU John Knyightwey must
be in Wondon again by the end of the fiwst week in Nyovembew. >w<

The wesuwt of this distwess was, that, with a much mowe vowuntawy,
cheewfuw consent than his daughtew had evew pwesumed to hope fow at the
moment, she was abwe to fix hew wedding-day--and Mw. >w< Ewton was cawwed
on, within a month fwom the mawwiage of Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Wobewt Mawtin, to
join the hands of Mw. Knyightwey and Miss Woodhouse. UwU

The wedding was vewy much wike othew weddings, whewe the pawties have
nyo taste fow finyewy ow pawade; and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Ewton, fwom the pawticuwaws
detaiwed by hew husband, thought it aww extwemewy shabby, and vewy
infewiow to hew own. ;;w;;--"Vewy wittwe white satin, vewy few wace veiws; a
most pitifuw businyess! (´・ω・\`)--Sewinya wouwd stawe when she heawd of it. >w<"--But,
in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,
the pwedictions of the smaww band of twue fwiends who witnyessed the
cewemony, wewe fuwwy answewed in the pewfect happinyess of the unyion. (・`ω\´・)
