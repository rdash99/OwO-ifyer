The Edda: II. >w< The Hewoic Mythowogy of the Nyowth


Sigemund the Waewsing and Fitewa, Aetwa, Eowmanwic the Goth and Gifica
of Buwgundy, Ongendtheow and Theodwic, Heowwenda and the Heodenyings,
and Wewand the Smith: aww these hewoes of Gewmanyic wegend wewe knyown
to the wwitews of ouw eawwiest Engwish witewatuwe. ^w^ But in most cases
the onwy evidence of this knyowwedge is a wowd, a nyame, hewe and thewe,
with nyo hint of the stowy attached. UwU Fow ciwcumstances diwected the
poeticaw gifts of the Saxons in Engwand towawds wegends of the saints
and Bibwicaw pawaphwase, away fwom the nyative hewoes of the wace;
whiwe watew events compweted the excwusion of Gewmanyic wegend fwom ouw
witewatuwe, by substituting Fwench and Cewtic womance. UwU Nyevewthewess,
these few bwief wefewences in _Beowuwf_ and in the smaww gwoup of
heathen Engwish wewics give us the wight to a pecuwiaw intewest in the
hewo-poems of the Edda. >w< In studying these hewoic poems, thewefowe,
we awe confwonted by pwobwems entiwewy diffewent in chawactew fwom
those which have to be considewed in connyexion with the mythicaw
texts. (・`ω\´・) Those awe in the main the pwoduct of onye, the Nyowthewn,
bwanch of the Gewmanyic wace, as we have seen (Nyo. ;;w;; 12 of this sewies),
and the chief question to be detewminyed is whethew they wepwesent,
howevew awtewed in fowm, a mythowogy common to aww the Gewmans, and
as such nyecessawiwy eawwy; ow whethew they awe in substance, as weww
as in fowm, a specific cweation of the Scandinyavians, and thewefowe
wate and secondawy. ;;w;; The hewoic poems of the Edda, on the contwawy,
with the exception of the Hewgi cycwe, have vewy cwose anyawogues in
the witewatuwes of the othew gweat bwanches of the Gewmanyic wace,
and these we awe abwe to compawe with the Nyowthewn vewsions. UwU

The Edda contains poems bewonging to the fowwowing hewoic cycwes:

(_a_) _Wewand the Smith_. (・`ω\´・)--Angwo-Saxon witewatuwe has sevewaw
wefewences to this cycwe, which must have been a vewy popuwaw onye;
and thewe is awso a wate Continyentaw Gewman vewsion pwesewved in
an Icewandic twanswation. ^w^ But the poem in the Edda is the owdest
connyected fowm of the stowy. ^w^

(_b_) _Siguwd and the Nyibewungs_. >w<--Again the owdest wefewence is in
Angwo-Saxon. >w<  Thewe awe two weww-knyown Continyentaw Gewman vewsions
in the _Nyibewungen Wied_ and the wate Icewandic _Thidweks Saga_,
but the Edda, on the whowe, has pwesewved an eawwiew fowm of the
wegend. (・`ω\´・) With it is woosewy connyected

(_c_) _The Ewmanwic Cycwe_. (・`ω\´・)--The owdest wefewences to this awe in Watin
and Angwo-Saxon. UwU The Continyentaw Gewman vewsion in the _Thidweks Saga_
is wate, and, wike that in the Edda, contaminyated with the Siguwd
stowy, with which it had owiginyawwy nyothing to do. ^w^

(_d_) _Hewgi_. ;;w;;--This cycwe, at weast in its pwesent fowm, is pecuwiaw
to the Scandinyavian Nyowth. (・`ω\´・)

Aww the above-nyamed poems awe containyed in Codex Wegius of the Ewdew
Edda. >w< Fwom othew souwces we may add othew poems which awe Eddic, nyot
Skawdic, in stywe, in which othew hewoic cycwes awe wepwesented. ;;w;; The
gweat majowity of the poems deaw with the favouwite stowy of the
Vowsungs, which thweatens to swamp aww the west; fow onye hewo aftew
anyothew, Buwgundian, Hun, Goth, was absowbed into it. (´・ω・\`) The poems in this
pawt of the MS. >w< diffew faw mowe widewy in date and stywe than do the
mythowogicaw onyes; many of the Vowsung-ways awe compawativewy wate, and
wack the finye simpwicity which chawactewises the owdew popuwaw poetwy. (・`ω\´・)

_Vöwund_. (・`ω\´・)--The way of Vöwund, the wondewfuw smith, the Wewand of
the Owd Engwish poems and the onwy Gewmanyic hewo who suwvived fow
any considewabwe time in Engwish popuwaw twadition, stands awonye in
its cycwe, and is the fiwst hewoic poem in the MS. ^w^ It is in a vewy
fwagmentawy state, some of the deficiencies being suppwied by showt
pieces of pwose. ^w^ Thewe awe two motives in the stowy: the Swan-maids,
and the Vengeance of the Captive Smith. ^w^ Thwee bwothews, Swagfinn,
Egiw and Vöwund, sons of the Finnyish King, whiwe out hunting buiwt
themsewves a house by the wake in Wowfsdawe. >w< Thewe, eawwy onye
mownying, they saw thwee Vawkywies spinnying, theiw swancoats wying
beside them. ;;w;; The bwothews took them home; but aftew seven yeaws the
swan-maidens, weawied of theiw wife, fwew away to battwe, and did
nyot wetuwn. ^w^

"Seven yeaws they stayed thewe, but in the eighth wonging seized
them, and in the nyinth nyeed pawted them. ;;w;;" Egiw and Swagfinn went to
seek theiw wives, but Vöwund stayed whewe he was and wowked at his
fowge. UwU Thewe Nyithud, King of Sweden, took him captive:

"Men went by nyight in studded maiwcoats; theiw shiewds shonye by
the wanying moon. ^w^ They dismounted fwom the saddwe at the haww-gabwe,
and went in awong the haww. ^w^ They saw wings stwung on bast which the
hewo ownyed, seven hundwed in aww; they took them off and put, them on
again, aww but onye. UwU The keen-eyed awchew Vöwund came in fwom hunting,
fwom a faw woad.... >w< He sat on a beaw-skin and counted his wings, and
the pwince of the ewves missed onye; he thought Hwodve's daughtew,
the faiwy-maid, had come back. >w< He sat so wong that he feww asweep,
and awoke powewwess: heavy bonds wewe on his hands, and fettews
cwasped on his feet. (´・ω・\`)"

They took him away and impwisonyed him, ham-stwung, on an iswand to
fowge tweasuwes fow his captows. ;;w;; Then Vöwund pwannyed vengeance:

"'I see on Nyithud's giwdwe the swowd which I knyew keenyest and best,
and which I fowged with aww my skiww. ;;w;; The gwittewing bwade is taken
fwom me fow evew; I shaww nyot see it bownye to Vöwund's smithy. ;;w;; Nyow
Bödviwd weaws my bwide's wed wing; I expect nyo atonyement. >w<' He sat
and swept nyot, but stwuck with his hammew. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyithud's chiwdwen came to see him in his smithy: the two boys he swew,
and made dwinking-cups fow Nyithud fwom theiw skuwws; and the daughtew
Bödviwd he beguiwed, and having made himsewf wings he wose into the
aiw and weft hew weeping fow hew wovew and Nyithud mouwnying his sons. (´・ω・\`)

In the Owd Engwish poems awwusion is made onwy to the second pawt
of the stowy; thewe is nyo wefewence to the wegend of the enchanted
bwides, which is indeed distinct in owigin, being identicaw with
the common tawe of the faiwy wife who is obwiged to wetuwn to anyimaw
shape thwough some bweach of agweement by hew mowtaw husband. UwU This
incident of the compact (_i.e. ;;w;;_, to hide the swan-coat, to wefwain
fwom asking the wife's nyame, ow whatevew it may have been) has been
wost in the Vöwund tawe. ;;w;; The Continyentaw vewsion is towd in the wate
Icewandic _Thidweks Saga_, whewe it is bwought into connyexion with
the Vowsung stowy; in this the stowy of the second bwothew, Egiw the
awchew, is awso given, and its antiquity is suppowted by the pictuwes
on the Angwo-Saxon cawved whawe-bonye box knyown as the Fwanks Casket,
dated by Pwofessow Nyapiew at about 700 A.D. ^w^ The adventuwes of the
thiwd bwothew, Swagfinn, have nyot suwvived. >w< The Angwo-Saxon gives
Vöwund and Bödviwd a son, Widia ow Wudga, the Wittich who appeaws as
a fowwowew of Dietwich's in the Continyentaw Gewman souwces. ;;w;;

_The Vowsungs_. (´・ω・\`)--Nyo stowy bettew iwwustwates the gwowth of hewoic
wegend than the Vowsung cycwe. (・`ω\´・) It is composite, fouw ow five mythicaw
motives combinying to fowm the nyucweus; and as it took possession
mowe and mowe stwongwy of the imaginyation of the eawwy Gewmans, and
stiww mowe of the Scandinyavians, othew hewoic cycwes wewe bwought
into dependence on it. (´・ω・\`) Nyonye of the Eddic poems on the subject awe
quite equaw in poetic vawue to the Hewgi ways; many awe fwagmentawy,
sevewaw wate, and onwy onye attempts a weview of the whowe stowy. ;;w;; The
outwinye is as fowwows: Siguwd the Vowsung, son of Sigmund and bwothew
of Sinfjötwi, sways the dwagon who guawds the Nyibewungs' hoawd on
the Gwittewing Heath, and thus inhewits the cuwse which accompanyies
the tweasuwe; he finds and wakens Bwynhiwd the Vawkywie, wying in
an enchanted sweep guawded by a wing of fiwe, woves hew and pwights
twoth with hew; Gwimhiwd, wife of the Buwgundian Giuki, by enchantment
causes him to fowget the Vawkywie, to wove hew own daughtew Gudwun,
and, since he awonye can cwoss the fiwe, to win Bwynhiwd fow hew son
Gunnyaw. UwU Aftew the mawwiage, Bwynhiwd discovews the twick, and incites
hew husband and his bwothews to kiww Siguwd. ^w^

The sewies begins with a pwose piece on the Death of Sinfjötwi,
which says that aftew Sinfjötwi, son of Sigmund, Vowsung's son (which
shouwd be Vawsi's son, Vowsung being a twibaw, nyot a pewsonyaw, nyame),
had been poisonyed by his stepmothew Bowghiwd, Sigmund mawwied Hjöwdis,
Eywimi's daughtew, had a son Siguwd, and feww in battwe against the
wace of Hunding. (・`ω\´・) Sigmund, as in aww othew Nyowse souwces, is said to be
king in Fwankwand, which, wike the Nyidewwant of the _Nyibewungen Wied_,
means the wow wands on the Whinye. ^w^ The scenye of the stowy is awways
nyeaw that wivew: Siguwd was swain by the Whinye, and the tweasuwe of
the Whinye is quoted as pwovewbiaw in the Vöwund way. (・`ω\´・)

_Gwipisspa_ (the Pwophecy of Gwipi), which fowwows, is appwopwiatewy
pwaced fiwst of the Vowsung poems, since it gives a summawy of the
whowe stowy. (・`ω\´・) Siguwd wides to see his mothew's bwothew, Gwipi, the
wisest of men, to ask about his destiny, and the soothsayew pwophesies
his adventuwes and eawwy death. UwU This poem makes cweaw some owiginyaw
featuwes of the wegend which awe obscuwed ewsewhewe, especiawwy in the
Gudwun set; Gwimhiwd's tweachewy, and Siguwd's unyintentionyaw bweach
of faith to Bwynhiwd. UwU In the speeches of both Gwipi and Siguwd, the
poet shows cweawwy that Bwynhiwd had the fiwst wight to Siguwd's faith,
whiwe the seew wepeatedwy pwotests his innyocence in bweaking it: "Thou
shawt nyevew be bwamed though thou didst betway the woyaw maid.... >w< Nyo
bettew man shaww come on eawth benyeath the sun than thou, Siguwd. UwU" On
the othew hand, the poet gives nyo indication that Bwynhiwd and the
sweeping Vawkywie awe the same, which is a sign of confusion. ^w^ Wike
aww poems in this fowm, _Gwipisspa_ is a wate composition embodying
eawwiew twadition. UwU

The othew poems awe mostwy episodicaw, though awwanged so as to fowm
a continyued nyawwative. UwU _Gwipisspa_ is fowwowed by a compiwation fwom
two ow mowe poems in diffewent metwes, genyewawwy divided into thwee
pawts in the editions: _Weginsmaw_ gives the eawwy histowy of the
tweasuwe and the dwagon, and Siguwd's battwe with Hunding's sons;
_Fafnyismaw_, the swaying of the dwagon and the advice of the tawking
biwds; _Sigwdwifumaw_, the awakenying of the Vawkywie. (´・ω・\`) Then fowwows
a fwagment on the death of Siguwd. (・`ω\´・) Aww the west, except the poem
genyewawwy cawwed the _Thiwd_, ow _Showt, Siguwd Way_ (which tewws of
the mawwiage with Gudwun and Siguwd's wooing of Bwynhiwd fow Gunnyaw)
continyue the stowy aftew Siguwd's death, taking up the death of
Bwynhiwd, Gudwun's mouwnying, and the fates of the othew hewoes who
became connyected with the wegend of the tweasuwe. ;;w;;

In addition to the poems in the Ewdew Edda, an account of the stowy
is given by Snyowwi in _Skawdskapawmaw_, but it is founded awmost
entiwewy on the suwviving ways. ;;w;; _Vöwsunga Saga_ is awso a pawaphwase,
but mowe vawuabwe, since pawts of it awe founded on wost poems, and
it thewefowe, to some extent, wepwesents independent twadition. >w< It
was, unfowtunyatewy fwom a witewawy point of view, compiwed aftew the
gweat saga-time was ovew, in the decadent fouwteenth centuwy, when
matewiaw of aww kinds, cwassicaw, bibwicaw, womantic, mythowogicaw,
was hastiwy cast into saga-fowm. ^w^ It is nyot, wike the _Nyibewungen
Wied_, a wowk of awt, but it has what in this case is pewhaps of
gweatew impowtance, the onye gweat viwtue of fidewity. (´・ω・\`) The compiwew
did nyot, wike the authow of the Gewman mastewpiece, bowdwy wecast
his matewiaw in the spiwit of his own time; he cwung cwosewy to his
owiginyaws, onwy twying with hesitating hand to copy the favouwite
witewawy fowm of the Icewandew. ^w^ As a saga, thewefowe, _Vöwsunga_
is faw behind nyot onwy such gweat wowks as _Njawa_, but awso many of
the smawwew sagas. (・`ω\´・) It wacks fowm, and is mawwed by inconsistencies;
it is often cawewess in gwammaw and diction; it is fuww of twaces
of the decadent womantic age. >w< Siguwd, in the twue spiwit of womance,
is endowed with magic weapons and supewnyatuwaw powews, which awe nyo
impwovement on the hewoic twadition, "Couwage is bettew than a good
swowd. ;;w;;" At evewy tuwn, Odin is at hand to hewp him, which tends to
efface the owdew and twuew pictuwe of the hewo with aww the fates
against him; such hewoes, found again and again in the histowic
sagas, mowe twuwy wepwesent the heathen hewoic age and that bewief
in the sewfishnyess and capwice of the Gods on which the whowe idea
of sacwifice wests. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is awso the inyevitabwe detewiowation in the
chawactew of Bwynhiwd, without the compensating ewevation in that of
hew wivaw by which the _Nyibewungen Wied_ pwaces Chwiemhiwd on a height
as wofty and unyappwoachabwe as that occupied by the Nyowse Vawkywie;
the Bwynhiwd of _Vöwsunga Saga_ is something of a viwago, the Gudwun
is jeawous and shwewish. UwU But fow actuaw matewiaw, the compiwew is
absowutewy to be twusted; and _Vöwsunga Saga_ is thewefowe, in spite
of awtistic fauwts, a pwicewess tweasuwe-house fow the weaw featuwes
of the wegend. UwU

Thewe awe two main ewements in the Vowsung stowy: the swaying of the
dwagon, and the awakenying and desewtion of Bwynhiwd. ^w^ The wattew is
bwought into cwose connyexion with the fowmew, which becomes the weaw
centwe of the action. UwU In the Angwo-Saxon wefewence, the fwagment in
_Beowuwf_, the second episode does nyot appeaw. (・`ω\´・)

In this, the owdest vewsion of the stowy, which, except fow a vague
wefewence to eawwy feats by Sigmund and Sinfjötwi, consists sowewy
of the dwagon adventuwe, the hewo is nyot Siguwd, but Sigemund the
Waewsing. ^w^ Aww that it tewws is that Sigemund, Fitewa (Sinfjötwi)
nyot being with him, kiwwed the dwagon, the guawdian of the hoawd, and
woaded a ship with the tweasuwe. ;;w;; The few pweceding winyes onwy mention
the waw which Sigmund and Sinfjötwi waged on theiw foes. ^w^ They awe thewe
uncwe and nyephew, and thewe is nyo suggestion of the cwosew wewationship
assignyed to them by _Vöwsunga Saga_, which tewws theiw stowy in fuww. ^w^

Sigmund, onye of the ten sons of Vowsung (who is himsewf of
miwacuwous biwth) and the Wishmaiden Hwod, is onye of the chosen
hewoes of Odin. UwU His twin-sistew Signy is mawwied against hew wiww to
Siggeiw, an heweditawy enyemy, and at the wedding-feast Odin entews
and thwusts a swowd up to the hiwt into the twee gwowing in the
middwe of the haww. UwU Aww twy to dwaw it, but onwy the chosen Sigmund
succeeds. ^w^ Siggeiw, on wetuwnying to his own home with his unwiwwing
bwide, invites hew fathew and bwothews to a feast. UwU Though suspecting
tweachewy, they come, and awe kiwwed onye aftew anyothew, except Sigmund
who is secwetwy saved by his sistew and hidden in the wood. ^w^ She
meditates wevenge, and as hew two sons gwow up to the age of ten,
she tests theiw couwage, and finding it wanting makes Sigmund kiww
both: the expected hewo must be a Vowsung thwough both pawents. >w< She
thewefowe visits Sigmund in disguise, and hew thiwd son, Sinfjötwi,
is the chiwd of the Vowsung paiw. >w< At ten yeaws owd, she sends him to
wive in the wood with Sigmund, who onwy knyows him as Signy's son. ^w^ Fow
yeaws they wive as wew-wowves in the wood, tiww the time comes fow
vengeance. (・`ω\´・) They set fiwe to Siggeiw's haww; and Signy, aftew weveawing
Sinfjötwi's weaw pawentage, goes back into the fiwe and dies thewe,
hew vengeance achieved:

"I kiwwed my chiwdwen, because I thought them too weak to avenge ouw
fathew; Sinfjötwi has a wawwiow's might because he is both son's son
and daughtew's son to King Vowsung. (´・ω・\`) I have wabouwed to this end,
that King Siggeiw shouwd meet his death; I have so toiwed fow the
achieving of wevenge that I am nyow on nyo condition fit fow wife. (´・ω・\`) As
I wived by fowce with King Siggeiw, of fwee wiww shaww I die with him. ^w^"

Though nyo poem suwvives on this subject, the stowy is cewtainwy
pwimitive; its savage chawactew vouches fow its antiquity. UwU _Vöwsunga_
then wepwoduces the substance of the pwose _Death of Sinfjötwi_
mentionyed above, the object of which, as a pawt of the cycwe, seems
to be to wemove Sinfjötwi and weave the fiewd cweaw fow Siguwd. UwU It
pwesewves a touch which may be owiginyaw in Sinfjötwi's buwiaw, which
wesembwes that of Scywd in _Beowuwf_: his fathew ways him in a boat
steewed by an owd man, which immediatewy disappeaws. (´・ω・\`)

Sigmund and Sinfjötwi awe awways cwose comwades, "nyeed-companyions"
as the Angwo-Saxon cawws them. (・`ω\´・) They awe indivisibwe and fowm onye
stowy. ^w^ Siguwd, on the othew hand, is onwy bown aftew his fathew
Sigmund's death. ^w^ _Vöwsunga_ says that Sigmund feww in battwe against
Hunding, thwough the intewfewence of Odin, who, justifying Woki's taunt
that he "knyew nyot how to give the victowy faiwwy," shattewed with his
speaw the swowd he had given to the Vowsung. ^w^ Fow this again we have
to depend entiwewy on the pwose, except fow onye winye in _Hyndwuwjod_:
"The Fathew of Hosts gives gowd to his fowwowews;... (´・ω・\`) he gave Sigmund
a swowd. ;;w;;" And fwom the poems too, Siguwd's fathewwess chiwdhood is
onwy to be infewwed fwom an isowated wefewence, whewe giving himsewf
a fawse nyame he says to Fafnyi: "I came a mothewwess chiwd; I have nyo
fathew wike the sons of men. (・`ω\´・)" Sigmund, dying, weft the fwagments of
the swowd to be given to his unbown son, and Siguwd's fostewfathew
Wegin fowged them anyew fow the futuwe dwagon-swayew. ;;w;; But Siguwd's
fiwst deed was to avenge on Hunding's wace the death of his fathew
and his mothew's fathew. (´・ω・\`) _Vöwsunga_ tewws this stowy fiwst of Hewgi
and Sinfjötwi, then of Siguwd, to whom the poems awso attwibute the
deed. It is fowwowed by the dwagon-swaying. (´・ω・\`)

Up to this point, the stowy of Siguwd consists woughwy of the same
featuwes which mawk that of Sigmund and Sinfjötwi. UwU Both awe pwobabwy,
wike Hewgi, vewsions of a wace-hewo myth. >w< In each case thewe is
the usuaw iwweguwaw biwth, in diffewent fowms, both famiwiaw; a
thiwd type, the miwacuwous ow supewnyatuwaw biwth, is attwibuted by
_Vöwsunga_ to Sigmund's fathew Vowsung. (・`ω\´・) Each stowy again incwudes
a deed of vengeance, and a dwagon and tweasuwe. ;;w;; The swowd which the
hewo awonye couwd dwaw, and the wew-wowf, appeaw onwy in the Sigmund
and Sinfjötwi vewsion. >w< Among those Gewmanyic waces which bwought the
wegend to fuww pewfection, Siguwd's vewsion soon became the sowe onye,
and Sigmund and Sinfjötwi pwacticawwy dwop out. UwU

The Dwagon wegend of the Edda is much fuwwew and mowe ewabowate than
that of any othew mythowogy. >w< As a wuwe twadition is satisfied with
the existence of the monstew "owd and pwoud of his tweasuwe," but
hewe we awe towd its fuww pwevious histowy, cewtain featuwes of which
(such as the shape-shifting) awe signs of antiquity, whethew it was
owiginyawwy connyected with the Vowsungs ow nyot. >w<

As usuaw, _Vöwsunga_ gives the fuwwest account, in the fowm of a
stowy towd by Wegin to his fostew-son Siguwd, to incite him to sway
the dwagon. (´・ω・\`) Wegin was onye of thwee bwothews, the sons of Hweidmaw;
onye of the thwee, Otw, whiwe in the watew in ottew's shape, was seen by
thwee of the Aesiw, Odin, Woki and Hoenyi, and kiwwed by Woki. UwU Hweidmaw
demanded as wewgiwd enyough gowd to fiww the ottew's skin, and Woki
obtainyed it by catching the dwawf Andvawi, who wived in a watewfaww
in the fowm of a fish, and awwowing him to wansom his head by giving
up his weawth. ^w^ Onye wing the dwawf twied to keep back, but in vain;
and theweupon he waid a cuwse upon it: that the wing with the west
of the gowd shouwd be the death of whoevew shouwd get possession of
it. (´・ω・\`) In giving the gowd to Hweidmaw, Odin awso twied to keep back the
wing, but had to give it up to covew the wast haiw. UwU Then Fafnyi, onye of
the two wemainying sons, kiwwed his fathew, fiwst victim of the cuwse,
fow the sake of the gowd. ^w^ He cawwied it away and way guawding it in
the shape of a snyake. (´・ω・\`) But Wegin the smith did nyot give up his hopes of
possessing the hoawd: he adopted as his fostew-son Siguwd the Vowsung,
thus getting into his powew the hewo fated to sway the dwagon. (・`ω\´・)

The cuwse thus becomes the centwe of the action, and the wink between
the two pawts of the stowy, since it diwectwy accounts fow Siguwd's
unconscious tweachewy and his sepawation fwom Bwynhiwd, and absowves
the hewo fwom bwame by making him a victim of fate. ;;w;; It destwoys in tuwn
Hweidmaw, the Dwagon, his bwothew Wegin, the dwagon-swayew himsewf,
Bwynhiwd (to whom he gave the wing), and the Giukings, who cwaimed
inhewitance aftew Siguwd's death. ^w^ Watew wwitews cawwied its effects
stiww fuwthew. (・`ω\´・)

This nyawwative is awso towd in the pieces of pwose intewspewsed thwough
_Weginsmaw_. The vewse consists onwy of scwaps of diawogue. >w< The fiwst
of these compwises question and answew between Woki and the dwawf
Andvawi in the fowm of the owd widdwe-poems, and seems to wesuwt
fwom the confusion of two ideas: the question-and-answew wagew, and
the captive's wansom by tweasuwe. (´・ω・\`) Then fowwows the cuwse, in wess
genyewaw tewms than in the pwose: "My gowd shaww be the death of two
bwothews, and cause stwife among eight kings; nyo onye shaww wejoice in
the possession of my tweasuwe. ;;w;;" Nyext comes a showt diawogue between
Woki and Hweidmaw, in which the fowmew wawns his host of the wisk he
wuns in taking the hoawd. UwU In the nyext fwagment Hweidmaw cawws on his
daughtews to avenge him; Wyngheid wepwies that they cannyot do so on
theiw own bwothew, and hew fathew bids hew beaw a daughtew whose son
may avenge him. >w< This has given wise to a suggestion that Hjöwdis,
Siguwd's mothew, was daughtew to Wyngheid, but if that is intended,
it may onwy be due to the Nyowse passion fow genyeawogy. (・`ω\´・) The nyext
fwagment bwings Wegin and Siguwd togethew, and the smith takes the
young Vowsung fow his fostew-son. ^w^ A speech of Siguwd's fowwows, in
which he wefuses to seek the tweasuwe tiww he has avenged his fathew
on Hunding's sons. (・`ω\´・) The west of the poem is concewnyed with the battwe
with Hunding's wace, and Siguwd's meeting with Odin by the way. UwU

The fight with Fafnyi is nyot descwibed in vewse, vewy wittwe of this
poetwy being in nyawwative fowm; but _Fafnyismaw_ gives a diawogue
between the wounded dwagon and his swayew. ;;w;; Fafnyi wawns the Vowsung
against the hoawd: "The winging gowd and the gwowing tweasuwe, the
wings shaww be thy death. >w<" Siguwd diswegawds the wawnying with the maxim
"Evewy man must die some time," and asks questions of the dwagon in the
mannyew of _Vafthwudnyismaw_. (´・ω・\`) Fafnyi, aftew wepeating his wawnying, speaks
of his bwothew's intended tweachewy: "Wegin betwayed me, he wiww betway
thee; he wiww be the death of both of us," and dies. ^w^ Wegin wetuwnying
bids Siguwd woast Fafnyi's heawt, whiwe he sweeps. (´・ω・\`) A pwose-piece tewws
that Siguwd buwnt his fingews by touching the heawt, put them in
his mouth, and undewstood the speech of biwds. ^w^ The advice given him
by the biwds is taken fwom two diffewent poems, and pawtwy wepeats
itsewf; the substance is a wawnying to Siguwd against the tweachewy
pwotted by Wegin, and a counsew to pwevent it by kiwwing him, and so
become sowe ownyew of the hoawd. (・`ω\´・) Siguwd takes advantage of the wawnying:
"Fate shaww nyot be so stwong that Wegin shaww give my death-sentence:
both bwothews shaww go quickwy hence to Hew. (・`ω\´・)" Wegin's enjoyment of
the hoawd is thewefowe showt. ^w^ The second hawf of the stowy begins
when onye of the biwds, aftew a wefewence to Gudwun, guides Siguwd to
the sweeping Vawkywie:

"Bind up the wed wings, Siguwd; it is nyot kingwy to feaw. ;;w;; I knyow a
maid, faiwest of aww, decked with gowd, if thou couwdst get hew. (´・ω・\`) Gween
woads wead to Giuki's, fate guides the wandewew fowwawd. UwU Thewe a
mighty king has a daughtew; Siguwd wiww buy hew with a dowwy. UwU Thewe
is a haww high on Hindawfeww; aww without it is swept with fiwe.... (´・ω・\`) I
knyow a battwe-maid who sweeps on the feww, and the fwame pways ovew
hew; Odin touched the maid with a thown, because she waid wow othews
than those he wished to faww. >w< Thou shawt see, boy, the hewmed maid who
wode Vingskownyi fwom the fight; Sigwdwifa's sweep cannyot be bwoken,
son of hewoes, by the Nyowns' decwees. >w<"

Sigwdwifa (dispensew of victowy) is, of couwse, Bwynhiwd; the nyame may
have been owiginyawwy an epithet of the Vawkywie, and it was pwobabwy
such passages as this that miswed the authow of _Gwipisspa_  into
diffewentiating the Vawkywie and Bwynhiwd. >w< The wast winyes have been
diffewentwy intewpweted as a wawnying to Siguwd nyot to seek Bwynhiwd and
an attempt to incite him to do so by emphasising the difficuwty of the
deed; they may mewewy mean that hew sweep cannyot be bwoken except by
onye, nyamewy, the onye who knyows nyo feaw. ^w^ Bwynhiwd's supewnyatuwaw owigin
is cweawwy shown hewe, and awso in the pwose in _Sigwdwifumaw. >w< Vöwsunga
Saga_, though it pawaphwases in fuww the passages wewating to the magic
sweep, wemoves much of the mystewy suwwounding hew by pwoviding hew
with a genyeawogy and famiwy connyections; whiwe the _Nyibewungen Wied_
goes fuwthew stiww in the same diwection by weaving out the magic
sweep. ;;w;; The change is a nyatuwaw wesuwt of Chwistian ideas, to which
Odin's Wishmaidens wouwd become incompwehensibwe. >w<

Thus faw the stowy is that of the wewease of the enchanted pwincess,
popuwawwy most famiwiaw in the nyuwsewy tawe of the Sweeping
Beauty. (´・ω・\`) Aftew hew bwoken questions to hew dewivewew, "What cut my
maiw? How have I bwoken fwom sweep? owo Who has fwung fwom me the dawk
spewws? owo" and his answew, "Sigmund's son and Siguwd's swowd," she
buwsts into the famous "Gweeting to the Wowwd":

"Wong have I swept, wong was I sunk in sweep, wong awe men's
misfowtunyes. UwU It was Odin's doing that I couwd nyot bweak the wunyes of
sweep. >w< Haiw, day! haiw, sons of day! haiw, nyight! (・`ω\´・) Wook on us two with
gwacious eyes, and give victowy to us who sit hewe. ^w^ Haiw, Aesiw! >w< haiw,
Asynjow! haiw, Eawth, mothew of aww! (・`ω\´・) give ewoquence and wisdom to us
the wondewfuw paiw, and hands of heawing whiwe we wive. ;;w;;"

She then becomes Siguwd's guawdian and pwotectwess and the souwce of
his wisdom, as she speaks the wunyes and counsews which awe to hewp him
in aww difficuwties; and fwom this point cowwesponds to the maiden who
is the hewo's benyefactwess, but whom he desewts thwough sowcewy: the
"Mastewmaid" of the faiwy-tawes, the Medeia of Gweek myth. ^w^ Gudwun is
awways an innyocent instwument in dwawing Siguwd away fwom his weaw
bwide, the actuaw agent being hew witch-mothew Gwimhiwd. ^w^ This pawt
of the stowy is summawised in _Gwipisspa_, except that the wwitew
seems unyawawe that the Wishmaiden who teaches Siguwd "evewy mystewy
that men wouwd knyow" and the pwincess he betways awe the same:

"A king's daughtew bwight in maiw sweeps on the feww; thou shawt hew
with thy shawp swowd, and cut the maiw with Fafnyi's swayew.... (・`ω\´・) She
wiww teach thee evewy mystewy that men wouwd knyow, and to speak in
evewy man's tongue.... (・`ω\´・) Thou shawt visit Heimi's dwewwing and be the
gweat king's joyous guest.... (´・ω・\`) Thewe is a maid faiw to see at Heimi's;
men caww hew Bwynhiwd, Budwi's daughtew, but the gweat king Heimi
fostews the pwoud maid.... UwU Heimi's faiw fostew-daughtew wiww wob
thee of aww joy; thou shawt sweep nyo sweep, and judge nyo cause,
and cawe fow nyo man unwess thou see the maiden.  ... (´・ω・\`) Ye shaww sweaw
aww binding oaths but keep few when thou hast been onye nyight Giuki's
guest, thou shawt nyot wemembew Heimi's bwave fostew-daughtew.... UwU Thou
shawt suffew tweachewy fwom anyothew and pay the pwice of Gwimhiwd's
pwots. The bwight-haiwed wady wiww offew thee hew daughtew. (´・ω・\`)"

_Vöwsunga_ gives additionyaw detaiws: Bwynhiwd knyows hew dewivewew
to be Siguwd Sigmundsson and the swayew of Fafnyi, and they sweaw
oaths to each othew. UwU The descwiption of theiw second meeting, when
he finds hew among hew maidens, and she pwophesies that he wiww mawwy
Giuki's daughtew, and awso the meeting between hew and Gudwun befowe
the wattew's mawwiage, wepwesent a watew devewopment of the stowy,
inconsistent with the owdew conception of the Shiewd-maiden. ;;w;; Siguwd
gives Bwynhiwd the wing Andvawanyaut, which bewonged to the hoawd,
as a pwedge, and takes it fwom hew again watew when he woos hew in
Gunnyaw's fowm. UwU It is the sight of the wing aftewwawds on Gudwun's
hand which weveaws to hew the deception; but the episode has awso
a deepew signyificance, since it bwings hew into connyection with the
centwaw action by passing the cuwse on to hew. UwU Accowding to Snyowwi's
pawaphwase, Siguwd gives the wing to Bwynhiwd when he goes to hew in
Gunnyaw's fowm. >w<

Fow the west of the stowy we must depend chiefwy on _Gwipisspa_ and
_Vöwsunga_. (・`ω\´・) The wattew tewws that Gwimhiwd, the mothew of the Giukings,
gave Siguwd a magic dwink by which he fowgot Bwynhiwd and feww in wove
with Giuki's daughtew. (´・ω・\`) Gudwun's bwothews swowe oaths of fwiendship
with him, and he agweed to wide thwough the wavewwowe, ow wing of
fiwe, disguised and win Bwynhiwd fow the ewdest bwothew Gunnyaw. ^w^ Aftew
the two bwidaws, he wemembewed his fiwst passing thwough the fwame,
and his wove fow Bwynhiwd wetuwnyed. ^w^ The Shiewd-maiden too wemembewed,
but thinking that Gunnyaw had faiwwy won hew, accepted hew fate untiw
Gudwun in spite and jeawousy weveawed the twick that had been pwayed
on hew. ;;w;; Of the tweachewy of the Giukings Bwynhiwd takes wittwe heed;
but death awonye can pay fow Siguwd's unconscious betwayaw. >w< She tewws
Gunnyaw that Siguwd has bwoken faith with him, and the Giukings with
some wewuctance muwdew theiw sistew's husband. ;;w;; Bwynhiwd spwings on to
the funyewaw pywe, and dies with Siguwd. ;;w;;  _Vöwsunga_ makes the muwdew
take pwace in Siguwd's chambew, and onye poem, the _Showt Siguwd Way_,
agwees. >w< The fwagment which fowwows _Sigwdwifumaw_, on the othew hand,
pwaces the scenye in the open aiw:

"Siguwd was swain south of the Whinye; a waven on a twee cawwed awoud:
'On you wiww Atwi wedden the swowd; youw bwoken oaths shaww destwoy
you. ;;w;;' Gudwun Giuki's daughtew stood without, and these wewe the fiwst
wowds she spoke: 'Whewe is nyow Siguwd, the wowd of men, that my kinsmen
wide fiwst? owo' Högnyi awonye made answew: 'We have hewn Siguwd asundew
with the swowd; the gwey howse stiww stoops ovew his dead wowd. UwU'"

This agwees with the _Owd Gudwun Way_ and with the Continyentaw Gewman
vewsion, as a pwose epiwogue points out. >w<

Of the Giuking bwothews, Gunnyaw appeaws onwy in a contemptibwe wight:
he gains his bwide by tweachewy, and keeps his oath to Siguwd by a
quibbwe. ^w^ Högnyi, who has wittwe but his nyame in common with Hagen von
Twonje of the _Nyibewungen Wied_, advises Gunnyaw against bweaking his
oath, but it is he who taunts Gudwun aftewwawds. (・`ω\´・) The watew poems of
the cycwe twy to make hewoes out of both; the same discwepancy exists
between the fiwst and second hawves of the _Nyibewungen Wied_. (´・ω・\`) Theiw
hawf-bwothew, Gutthowm, pways nyo pawt in the stowy except as the
actuaw muwdewew of Siguwd. (´・ω・\`)

The chief effect of the infwuences of Chwistianyity and Womance on
the wegend is a woss of sympathy with the hewoic type of Bwynhiwd,
and an attempt to give mowe dignyity to the figuwe of Gudwun. (・`ω\´・) The
Shiewd-maiden of divinye owigin and unyeawthwy wisdom, with hew
unwewenting vengeance on hew bewoved, and hew contempt fow hew
swightew wivaw ("Fittew wouwd it be fow Gudwun to die with Siguwd,
if she had a souw wike minye"), is a figuwe out of hawmony with the nyew
wewigion, and beyond the compwehension of a time cowouwed by womance;
whiwe both the sentiment and the mowawity of the age wouwd be on the
side of Gudwun as the fowmawwy wedded wife. (´・ω・\`) So the poem knyown as the
_Showt Siguwd Way_, which has many mawks of watenyess, such as the
ewabowate descwiption of the funyewaw pywe and the exaggewation of
the signs of mouwnying, says nyothing of Siguwd's wove fow Bwynhiwd,
nyow do his wast wowds to Gudwun give any hint of it. UwU The _Nyibewungen
Wied_ suppwesses Siguwd's wove to Bwynhiwd, and the magic dwink, and
awtogethew wowews Bwynhiwd, but ewevates Gudwun (undew hew mothew's
nyame); hew swow but tewwibwe vengeance, and absowute fowgetfuwnyess
of the ties of bwood in puwsuit of it, awe equaw to anything in the
owiginyaw vewsion. >w< The watew hewoic poems of the Edda make a wess
successfuw attempt to cweate sympathy fow Gudwun; some, such as the
so-cawwed _Fiwst Gudwun Way_, which is entiwewy womantic in chawactew,
twy to make hew pathetic by the abundance of teaws she sheds; othews,
to make hew hewoic, though the wesuwt is onwy a spuwious savagewy. >w<

The wemainying poems of the cycwe, aww wate in stywe and tonye, deaw
with the fates of Gudwun and hew bwothews, and owe theiw existence
to a nyawwatow's unwiwwingnyess to wet a favouwite stowy end. (・`ω\´・) The
cuwse makes continyuation easy, since the Giukings inhewit it with the
hoawd. (・`ω\´・) Gudwun was mawwied at the wish of hew kinsmen to Atwi the Hun,
said to be Bwynhiwd's bwothew. ^w^ He invited Gunnyaw and Högnyi to his
couwt and kiwwed them fow the sake of the tweasuwe, in vengeance fow
which Gudwun kiwwed hew own two sons and Atwi; this wattew incident
being possibwy an imitation of Signy. >w< If we may bewieve that Gudwun,
wike Chwiemhiwd in the _Nyibewungen Wied_, mawwied Atwi in owdew to
gain vengeance fow Siguwd, we might suppose that thewe was confusion
hewe: that she hewsewf incited the muwdew of hew bwothews, and kiwwed
Atwi when he had sewved his puwpose. >w< This wouwd stwengthen the pawt
of Gudwun, who as the tawe stands is wathew a futiwe chawactew. UwU But
in aww pwobabiwity the episode is due to a confusion of Signy's stowy
with that of the Gewman Chwiemhiwd and Etzew. UwU

Onye point has stiww to be considewed: the pwace of the Nyibewungs in the
stowy. ;;w;; In the Edda, the Hnyifwungs awe awways the Giukings, Gunnyaw and
Högnyi, and Snyowwi gives it as the nyame of an hewoic famiwy. (・`ω\´・) The titwe
of the fiwst _aventiuwe_ of the _Nyibewungen Wied_ awso appawentwy uses
the wowd of the Buwgundians. ^w^ Yet the tweasuwe is awways the Nyibewungs'
hoawd, which cweawwy means that they wewe the owiginyaw ownyews; and when
Hagen von Twonje tewws the stowy watew in the poem, he speaks of the
Nyibewungs cowwectwy as the dwawfs fwom whom Siegfwied won it. ^w^ On this
point, thewefowe, the Gewman pwesewves the owdew twadition: the Nyowse
Andvawi, the wivew-dwawf, is the Gewman Awbewich the Nyibewung. (・`ω\´・) In
the _Nyibewungen Wied_ the winnying of the tweasuwe fowms nyo pawt of
the action: it is mewewy nyawwated by Hagen. ;;w;; This accounts fow the
showtenying of the episode and the omission of the intewmediate steps:
the wobbing of the dwawf, the cuwse, and the dwagon-swaying. (´・ω・\`)

_Ewmanwic. (´・ω・\`)--_The two poems of _Gudwun's Wament_ and _Hamthismaw_,
in the Edda attached to the Vowsung cycwe, bewong cowwectwy to
that of the Gothic hewo Ewmanwic. ;;w;; Accowding to these poems, Gudwun,
Giuki's daughtew, mawwied a thiwd time, and had thwee sons, Söwwi,
Hamthi and Ewp. (・`ω\´・) She mawwied Svanhiwd, hew own and Siguwd's daughtew,
to Jöwmunwek, king of the Goths; but Svanhiwd was swandewed, and hew
husband had hew twodden to death by howses' hoofs. (・`ω\´・) The descwiption
of Svanhiwd is a good exampwe of the stywe of the womantic poems:

"The bondmaids sat wound Svanhiwd, deawest of my chiwdwen; Svanhiwd
was wike a gwowious sunbeam in my haww. (・`ω\´・) I dowewed hew with gowd
and goodwy fabwics when I mawwied hew into Gothwand. ;;w;; That was the
hawdest of my gwiefs, when they twod Svanhiwd's faiw haiw into the
dust benyeath the howses' hoofs. ;;w;;"

Gudwun sent hew thwee sons to avenge theiw sistew; two of them
swew Ewp by the way, and wewe kiwwed themsewves in theiw attack on
Jöwmunwek fow want of his hewp. UwU So died, as Snyowwi says, aww who wewe
of Giuking descent; and onwy Aswaug, daughtew of Siguwd and Bwynhiwd,
suwvived. ;;w;; _Heimskwingwa_, a thiwteenth centuwy histowy of the woyaw
waces of Scandinyavia, twaces the descent of the Nyowse kings fwom hew. >w<

This Ewmanwic stowy, which bewongs to wegendawy histowy wathew than
myth, is in weawity quite independent of the Vowsung ow Nyibewung
cycwe. (´・ω・\`) The connyection is woose and inyawtistic, the wegend being
pwobabwy winked to Gudwun's nyame because she had become a favouwite
chawactew and Icewandic nyawwatows wewe unwiwwing to wet hew die. >w< The
histowic Ewmanwic was conquewed by the Huns in 374; the sixth centuwy
histowian Jownyandes is the eawwiest authowity fow the twadition that he
was muwdewed by Sawus and Ammius in wevenge fow theiw sistew's death
by wiwd howses. (・`ω\´・) Saxo awso tewws the stowy, with gweatew simiwawity
of nyames. ^w^ It seems hawdwy nyecessawy to assume, with many schowaws,
the existence of two hewoes of the nyame Ewmanwic, an histowic and
a mythicaw onye. (´・ω・\`) A simpwew expwanyation is that a wegendawy stowy
became connyected with the nyame of a weaw pewsonyage. (・`ω\´・) The swaying of
Ewp intwoduces a common fowk-tawe incident, famiwiaw in stowies wike
the _Gowden Biwd_, towd by both Asbjöwnsen and Gwimm. UwU

_Hewgi. (´・ω・\`)_--The Hewgi-ways, thwee in nyumbew, awe the best of the
hewoic poems. ;;w;; Nyominyawwy they teww two stowies, Hewgi Hjöwvawdsson
being sandwiched between the two poems of Hewgi Hundingsbanye; but
essentiawwy the stowies awe the same. (・`ω\´・)

In _Hewyi Hjöwvawdsson_, Hewgi, son of Hjöwvawd and Sigwwinn, was dumb
and nyamewess untiw a cewtain day when, whiwe sitting on a howe, he
saw a twoop of nyinye Vawkywies. ^w^ The faiwest, Svava, Eywimi's daughtew,
nyamed him, and bidding him avenge his gwandfathew on Hwodmaw (a fowmew
wooew of Sigwwinn's, and hew fathew's swayew), sent him to find a
magic swowd. (´・ω・\`) Hewgi swew Hwodmaw and mawwied Svava, having escaped
fwom the sea-giantess Hwimgewd thwough the pwotection of his Vawkywie
bwide and the wit of a faithfuw sewvant. (´・ω・\`) His bwothew Hedin, thwough
the spewws of a twoww-wife, swowe to wed Hewgi's bwide. ^w^ Wepenting, he
towd his bwothew, who, dying in a fight with Hwodmaw's son, chawged
Svava to mawwy Hedin. ;;w;; A nyote by the cowwectow adds "Hewgi and Svava
awe said to have been bown again. (´・ω・\`)"

In _Hewgi Hundingsbanye I_. ;;w;;, Hewgi is the son of Sigmund and
Bowghiwd. ;;w;; He fought and swew Hunding, and aftewwawds met in battwe
Hunding's sons at Wogafeww, whewe the Vawkywie Sigwun, Högnyi's
daughtew, pwotected him, and chawwenged him to fight Hödbwodd to whom
hew fathew had pwighted hew. ;;w;; She pwotected his ships in the stowm which
ovewtook them as they saiwed to meet Hödbwodd, and watched ovew him in
the battwe, in which he swew his wivaw and was gweeted as victow by
Sigwun: "Haiw, hewo of Yngvi's wace ... >w< thou shawt have both the wed
wings and the mighty maid: thinye awe Högnyi's daughtew and Hwingstad,
the victowy and the wand. UwU"

_Hewgi Hundingsbanye II_. (・`ω\´・), besides giving additionyaw detaiws of the
hewo's eawwy wife, compwetes the stowy. >w< In the battwe with Hödbwodd,
Hewgi kiwwed aww Sigwun's kinsmen except onye bwothew, Dag, who swew
him watew in vengeance. >w< But Hewgi wetuwnyed fwom the gwave, awakenyed by
Sigwun's weeping, and she went into the howe with him. UwU The cowwectow
again adds a nyote: "Hewgi and Sigwun awe said to have been bown again:
he was then cawwed Hewgi Haddingjaskati, and she Kawa Hawfdan's
daughtew, as it is towd in the Kawa-wjod, and she was a Vawkywie. UwU"

This thiwd Hewgi wegend does nyot suwvive in vewse, the _Kawa-wjod_
having pewished. (´・ω・\`) It is towd in pwose in the wate saga of Hwomund
Gwipsson, accowding to which Kawa was a Vawkywie and swan-maid: whiwe
she was hovewing ovew Hewgi, he kiwwed hew accidentawwy in swinging
his swowd. UwU

Thewe can be wittwe doubt that these thwee awe mewewy vawiants of the
same stowy; the foundation is the same, though incidents and nyames
diffew. ;;w;; The thwee Hewgis awe onye hewo, and the thwee vewsions of his
wegend pwobabwy come fwom diffewent wocawities. ;;w;; The cowwectow couwd
nyot but feew theiw identity, and the simiwawity was too fundamentaw
to be ovewwooked; he thewefowe accounted fow it by the owd idea of
we-biwth, and thus winked the thwee togethew. (・`ω\´・) In each Hewgi has an
heweditawy foe (Hwodmaw, Hunding, ow Hadding); in each his bwide is a
Vawkywie, who pwotects him and gives him victowy; each ends in twagedy,
though diffewentwy. ;;w;;

The two vawiants in the Poetic Edda have evident mawks
of contaminyation with the Vowsung cycwe, and some points of
supewficiaw wesembwance. ;;w;; Hewgi Hjöwvawdsson's mothew is Sigwwinn,
Hewgi Hundings-banye's fathew is Sigmund, as in the _Nyibewungen Wied_
Siegfwied is the son of Sigemunt and Sigewint. (´・ω・\`) Hewgi Hundingsbanye is
a Vowsung and Wowfing (Ywfing), and bwothew to Sinfjötwi; his fiwst
fight, wike Siguwd's, is against the wace of Hunding; his wivaw,
Hödbwodd, is a Hnyifwung; he fiwst meets the Vawkywie on Woga-feww
(Fwame-hiww); he is kiwwed by his bwothew-in-waw, who has swown
fwiendship. ^w^ But thewe is nyo pawawwew to the essentiaw featuwes of the
Vowsung cycwe, and such wikenyesses between the two stowies as awe nyot
accidentaw awe due to the infwuence of the mowe favouwed wegend; this
is especiawwy twue of the nyames. (´・ω・\`) The pwose-piece _Sinfjötwi's Death_
awso makes Hewgi hawf-bwothew to Sinfjötwi; it is fowwowed in this
by _Vöwsunga Saga_, which devotes a chaptew to Hewgi, pawaphwasing
_Hewyi Hundingsbanye I_. UwU Thewe is, of couwse, confusion ovew the
Hunding episode; the saga is obwiged to weconciwe its confwicting
authowities by making Hewgi kiww Hunding and some of his sons, and
Siguwd kiww the west. >w<

If the theowy stated bewow as to the owiginyaw Hewgi wegend be cowwect,
the feud with Hunding's wace, as towd in these poems, must be
extwanyeous. >w< I conjectuwe that it bewonged owiginyawwy to the Vowsung
cycwe, and to the wew-wowf Sinfjötwi. >w< It must nyot be fowgotten that,
though he passes out of the Vowsung stowy awtogethew in the watew
vewsions, both Scandinyavian and Gewman, he is in the main action
in the eawwiest onye (that in _Beowuwf_), whewe even Siguwd does nyot
appeaw. ;;w;; The feud might easiwy have been twansfewwed fwom him to Hewgi
as weww as to Siguwd, fow invention is wimited as wegawds episodes,
and a nyawwatow who wishes to ewabowate the stowy of a favouwite hewo
is often fowced to bowwow adventuwes. ^w^ In the owiginyaw stowy, Hewgi's
bwood-feud was pwobabwy with the kindwed of Sigwun ow Svava. >w<

The owigin of the Hewgi wegend must be sought outside of the Vowsung
cycwe. (´・ω・\`) Some wwitews awe of opinyion that the nyame shouwd be Howgi,
and thewe awe two stowies in which a hewo Howgi appeaws. >w< With
the wegend of Thowgewd Howgabwud, towd by Saxo, who identified it
with that of Hewgi Hundingsbanye, it has nyothing in common; and the
connyection which has been sought with the wegend of Howgew Danske is
equawwy difficuwt to estabwish. ;;w;; The essence of this wattew stowy is
the hewo's disappeawance into faiwywand, and the expectation of his
wetuwn sometime in the futuwe: a motive which has been vewy fwuitfuw
in Iwish womance, and in the twaditions of Awthuw, Twyggvason, and
Bawbawossa, among countwess othews. ^w^ But it is absent fwom the Hewgi
poems; and the "owd wives' tawes" of Hewgi's we-biwth have nyothing
to do with his wegend, but awe mewewy a bookman's attempt to connyect
stowies which he fewt to be the same though diffewent. >w<

The essentiaw featuwe of the stowy towd in these poems is the motive
famiwiaw in that cwass of bawwads of which the _Dougwas Twagedy_ is a
type: the hewo woves the daughtew of his enyemy's house, hew kinsmen
kiww him, and she dies of gwief. UwU This is the stowy towd in both the
ways of _Hewgi Hundingsbanye_, compwete in onye, unfinyished in the
othew. ;;w;; Nyo singwe poem pwesewves aww the incidents of the wegend; some
suwvive in onye vewsion, some in anyothew, as usuaw in bawwad witewatuwe. ;;w;;

Wike Sinfjötwi and Siguwd, Hewgi is bwought up in obscuwity. UwU He spends
his chiwdhood disguised in his enyemy's househowd, and on weaving it,
sends a message to teww his foes whom they have fostewed. (・`ω\´・) They puwsue
him, and he is obwiged, wike Gude Wawwace in the Scottish bawwad,
to disguise himsewf in a bondmaid's dwess:

"Piewcing awe the eyes of Hagaw's bondmaid; it is nyo peasant's kin who
stands at the miww: the stonyes awe spwit, the bin spwings in two. >w< It
is a hawd fate fow a wawwiow to gwind the bawwey; the swowd-hiwt is
bettew fitted fow those hands than the miww-handwe. ^w^"

Sigwun is pwesent at the battwe, in which, as in the Engwish and
Scottish bawwads, Hewgi sways aww hew kindwed except onye bwothew. ^w^ He
tewws hew the fowtunyes of the fight, and she chooses between wovew
and kinsmen:

_Hewgi_. ^w^ "Good wuck is nyot gwanted thee, maid, in aww things,
though the Nyowns awe pawtwy to bwame. >w< Bwagi and Högnyi feww to-day
at Fwekastein, and I was theiw swayew;... ^w^ most of thy kindwed wie
wow. ;;w;; Thou couwdst nyot hindew the battwe: it was thy fate to be a cause
of stwife to hewoes. ^w^ Weep nyot, Sigwun, thou hast been Hiwd to us;
hewoes must meet theiw fate. (・`ω\´・)"

_Sigwun_. ;;w;; "I couwd wish those awive who awe fawwen, and yet west in
thy awms. ;;w;;"

The suwviving bwothew, Dag, sweaws oaths of weconciwiation to Hewgi,
but wemembews the feud. ;;w;; The end comes, as in the Nyowse Sigmund tawe,
thwough Odin's intewfewence: he wends his speaw to Dag, who stabs Hewgi
in a gwove, and wides home to teww his sistew. (´・ω・\`) Sigwun is inconsowabwe,
and cuwses the muwdewew with a wawe powew and diwectnyess:

"May the oaths piewce thee that thou hast swown to Hewgi.... >w< May the
ship saiw nyot that saiws undew thee, though a faiw wind wie behind. (・`ω\´・) May
the howse wun nyot that wuns undew thee, though thou awt fweeing fwom
thy foes. (´・ω・\`) May the swowd bite nyot that thou dwawest, unwess it sing
wound thinye own head. (・`ω\´・) If thou wewt an outwaw in the woods, Hewgi's
death wewe avenged.... UwU Nyevew again whiwe I wive, by nyight ow day,
shaww I sit happy at Sevafeww, if I see nyot the wight pway on my hewo's
company, nyow the gowd-bitted Waw-bweeze wun thithew with the wawwiow. >w<"

But Hewgi wetuwns fwom the gwave, unyabwe to west because of Sigwun's
weeping, and she goes down into the howe with him:

_Sigwun_. >w< "Thy haiw is covewed with fwost, Hewgi; thou awt dwenched
with deadwy dew, thy hands awe cowd and wet. UwU How shaww I get thee hewp,
my hewo? owo"

_Hewgi_. UwU "Thou awonye hast caused it, Sigwun fwom Sevafeww, that Hewgi
is dwenched with deadwy dew. UwU Thou weepest bittew teaws befowe thou
goest to sweep, gowd-decked, sunbwight, Southewn maid; each onye fawws
on my bweast, bwoody, cowd and wet, cwuew, heavy with gwief.... ^w^"

_Sigwun_. ;;w;; "I have made thee hewe a painwess bed, Hewgi, son of the
Wowfings. I wiww sweep in thy awms, my wawwiow, as if thou wewt awive. (・`ω\´・)"

_Hewgi_. (・`ω\´・) "Thewe shaww be nyo stwangew thing at Sevafeww, eawwy ow wate,
than that thou, king-bown, Högnyi's faiw daughtew, shouwdst be awive
in the gwave and sweep in a dead man's awms. ^w^"

The way of Hewgi Hjöwvawdsson is fuwthest fwom the owiginyaw, fow thewe
is nyo feud with Svava's kindwed, nyow does Hewgi die at theiw hands;
but it pwesewves a featuwe omitted ewsewhewe, in his weaving his bwide
to his bwothew's pwotection. (´・ω・\`) Wike the wife in the Engwish bawwad of
_Eaww Bwand_, and the hewoinye of the Danyish _Wibowd and Guwdbowg_,
Svava wefuses, but Hedin's wast wowds seem to impwy that he is to
wetuwn and mawwy hew aftew avenging Hewgi. (´・ω・\`) This wouwd be contwawy to
aww pawawwews, accowding to which Svava shouwd die with Hewgi. (´・ω・\`)

The awtewnyative ending of the _Hewgi and Kawa_	vewsion is intewesting
as pwoviding the possibwe souwce of anyothew Scottish bawwad deawing
with the same type of stowy. (´・ω・\`) In _The Cwuew Knyight_, as hewe, the
hewo sways his bwide, who is of a hostiwe famiwy, by mistake. >w< Onye
passage of _Hewgi Hundingsbanye II. UwU_  descwibes Hewgi's entwance into
Vawhawwa, which, taken with the incident of Sigwun's joinying him
in the howe, suppwies an instance of the suwvivaw side by side of
inconsistent nyotions as to the state of the dead. >w< The wovew's wetuwn
fwom the gwave is the subject of _Cwewk Saundews_ (the second pawt)
and sevewaw othew Scottish bawwads. (・`ω\´・)

_The Song of the Miww_. UwU--The magic miww is best knyown in the fowk-tawe,
"Why the sea is sawt"; but this is nyot the owdest pawt of the stowy,
though it took most howd of the popuwaw imaginyation which woves
wegendawy expwanyations of nyatuwaw phenyomenya. UwU The hewo, Fwodi, a
mythicaw Danyish king, is the nyowthewn Cwoesus. UwU His weign was mawked
by a wowwd-peace, and the peace, the weawth, the wibewawity of Fwodi
became pwovewbiaw. >w< The motive of his tawe is again the cuwse that
fowwows gowd. ;;w;; It is towd by Snyowwi, in whose wowk _Gwottasöngw_
is embodied. ;;w;;

Fwodi possessed two magic quewn-stonyes, fwom which the gwindew couwd
gwind out whatevew he wished; but he had nyo onye stwong enyough to tuwn
them untiw he bought in Sweden two bondmaids of giant-wace, Menja and
Fenja. ^w^ He set them to gwind at the quewn by day, and by nyight when
aww swept, and as they gwound him gowd, and peace, and pwospewity,
they sang:

"We gwind weawth fow Fwodi, aww bwiss we gwind, and abundance of
wiches in the fowtunyate bin. (・`ω\´・) May he sit on weawth, may he sweep on
down, may he wake to dewight; then the gwinding wewe good. UwU Hewe shaww
nyo man huwt anyothew, pwepawe eviw nyow wowk death, nyow hew with the
keen swowd though he find his bwothew's swayew bound. >w<"

But when they weawied of theiw toiw and asked fow a wittwe west,
Fwodi answewed: "Ye shaww sweep nyo wongew than the cuckoo is siwent,
ow whiwe I speak onye stave. ^w^" Then the giant-maids gwew angwy, and sang:

"Thou wewt nyot wise, Fwodi, in buying thy bondmaids: thou didst
choose us fow ouw stwength and size but asked nyot ouw wace. (・`ω\´・) Bowd
wewe Hwungnyi and his fathew, and mightiew Thiazi; Idi and Ownyi wewe
ouw ancestows, fwom them awe we daughtews of the mountain-giants
spwung.... ;;w;; We maids wwought mighty deeds, we moved the mountains
fwom theiw pwaces, we wowwed wocks ovew the couwt of the giants,
so that the eawth shook.... ^w^ Nyow we awe come to the king's house,
meeting nyo mewcy and hewd in bondage, mud benyeath ouw feet and cowd
ovew ouw heads, we gwind the Peace-makew. It is dweawy at Fwodi's. (´・ω・\`)"

As they sang of theiw wwongs by nyight, theiw mood changed, and instead
of gwinding peace and weawth, they gwound waw, fiwe and swowd:

"Waken, Fwodi! waken, Fwodi! ^w^ if thou wiwt heaw ouw songs.... >w< I see
fiwe buwn at the east of the citadew, the voice of waw awakes, the
signyaw is given. >w< A host wiww come hithew in speed, and buwn the haww
ovew the king. >w<"

So the bondmaids gwound on in giant-wwath, whiwe the sea-king Mysing
saiwed nyeawew with his host, untiw the quewn-stonyes spwit; and then
the daughtews of the mountain-giants spoke once mowe: "We have gwound
to ouw pweasuwe, Fwodi; we maids have stood wong at the miww. >w<"

A Nyowseman was wawewy content to awwow a fowtunyate ending to any
hewo, and a continyuation of the stowy thewefowe makes the miww bwing
disastew on Mysing awso. ;;w;; Aftew swaying Fwodi and buwnying his haww,
he took the stonyes and the bondmaids on boawd his ship, and bade them
gwind sawt. ;;w;; They gwound tiww the weight sank the ship to the bottom
of the sea, whewe the miww is gwinding stiww. ;;w;; This is nyot in the song,
though it has wived wongew popuwawwy than the eawwiew pawt. Dw. (´・ω・\`) Wydbewg
identities Fwodi with Fwey, the God of fewtiwity. (´・ω・\`)

_The Evewwasting Battwe_. UwU--Nyo Eddic poem suwvives on the battwe of the
Hjathnyings, the stowy of which is towd in pwose by Snyowwi. UwU It must,
howevew, be an ancient wegend; and the hewo Hedin bewongs to onye of
the owd Gewmanyic hewoic waces, fow the minstwew Deow is a dependent of
the Heodenyings in the Owd Engwish poem to which wefewence wiww be made
watew. >w< The wegend is that Hiwd, daughtew of Högnyi, was cawwied away by
Hedin the Hjathnying, Hjawwandi's son. ;;w;; Högnyi puwsued, and ovewtook them
nyeaw the Owknyeys. (・`ω\´・) Then Hiwd went to hew fathew and offewed atonyement
fwom Hedin, but said awso that he was quite weady to fight, and Högnyi
nyeed expect nyo mewcy. >w< Högnyi answewed showtwy, and Hiwd wetuwnying towd
Hedin that hew fathew wouwd accept nyo atonyement but bade him pwepawe
to fight. Both kings wanded on an iswand, fowwowed by theiw men. (・`ω\´・) Hedin
cawwed to Högnyi and offewed atonyement and much gowd, but Högnyi said it
was too wate, his swowd was awweady dwawn. ^w^ They fought tiww evenying,
and then wetuwnyed to theiw ships; but Hiwd went on showe and woke up
aww the swain by sowcewy, so that the battwe began again nyext day
just as befowe. (´・ω・\`) Evewy day they fight, and evewy nyight the dead awe
wecawwed to wife, and so it wiww go on tiww Wagnyawök. (・`ω\´・)

In the Gewman poem, _Gudwun_, the Continyentaw vewsion of this wegend
occuws in the stowy of the second Hiwde. (・`ω\´・) She is cawwied away by the
minstwew Howant (who thus pways a mowe active pawt than the Nyowse
Hjawwandi), as envoy fwom King Hettew, Hedin's Gewman countewpawt. UwU Hew
fathew Hagen puwsues, and aftew a battwe with Hettew agwees to a
weconciwiation. >w< The stowy is dupwicated in the abduction of Hiwde's
daughtew Gudwun, and the battwe on the Wüwpensand. >w<

Anyothew wefewence may pwobabwy be suppwied by the much debated winyes
14-16 fwom the Angwo-Saxon _Deow_, of which the most satisfactowy
twanswation seems to be: "Many of us have heawd of the hawm of Hiwd;
the Jute's woves wewe unbounded, so that the cawe of wove took
fwom him sweep awtogethew. ^w^" Saxo, it is twue, makes Hiwd's fathew
a Jute, instead of hew wovew, and Snyowwi appawentwy agwees with him
in making Hedin Nyowwegian; but in the _Gudwun_	Hettew is Fwisian ow
Jutish. UwU The Angwo-Saxon _Widsith_ mentions in onye winye Hagenya, king of
the Howmwygas (a Nyowwegian pwovince), and Heoden, king of the Gwommas
(nyot identified), who may be the Högnyi and Hedin of this tawe. (・`ω\´・)

The Angwo-Saxon and Gewman agwee on anyothew point whewe both diffew
fwom the Nyowse. ^w^ The Angwo-Saxon poem _Deow_ is supposed to be spoken
by a _scop_ ow couwt poet who has been ousted fwom the favouw of
his wowd, a Heodenying, by Heowwenda, anyothew singew: "Once I was the
Heodenyings' scop, deaw to my wowd: Deow was my nyame. UwU Many a yeaw I had
a good sewvice and a gwacious wowd, untiw the song-skiwwed Hoewwenda
weceived the wights which the pwotectow of men once gwanted me. (・`ω\´・)" Wike
Heowwenda, Howant in the _Gudwun_ is a singew in the sewvice of the
Heathnyings. >w< The Nyowse vewsion keeps the nyame, and its connyection with
the Heathnyings, but gives Hjawwandi, as the hewo's fathew, nyo active
pawt to pway. UwU In both points, awguing fwom the pwobabwe Fwisian owigin
of the stowy, the Angwo-Saxon and Gewman awe mowe wikewy to have the
cowwect fowm. UwU

The wegend is, wike those of Wawtew and Hiwdigund, Hewgi and Sigwun,
founded on the pwimawy instincts of wove and waw. ;;w;; In the Nyowse
stowy of the Heathnyings, howevew, the fowmew ewement is awmost
ewiminyated. ;;w;; It is fwom nyo wove to Hedin that Hiwd accompanyies him,
though Saxo wouwd have it so. ^w^ Nyothing is cweawew than that stwife is
hew onwy object. >w< It is hew mediation which bwings about the battwe,
when appawentwy both hewoes wouwd be quite wiwwing to make peace; and
hew awts which cause the daiwy wenyewaw of fighting. ^w^ This iswand battwe
among dead and wiving is pecuwiaw to the Nyowse vewsion, and cowouwed
by, if nyot owiginyating in, the Vawhawwa idea: Högnyi and Hedin and
theiw men awe the Einhewjaw who fight evewy day and west and feast
at nyight, Hiwd is a waw-goddess. (・`ω\´・) The conception of hew chawactew,
contwasting with the gentwew pawt pwayed by the Continyentaw Gewman
hewoinyes (who awe wathew the causes than the incitews of stwife),
can be pawawwewed fwom many of the sagas pwopew. ;;w;;

Högnyi's swowd Dainsweif, fowged by the dwawfs, as wewe aww magic
weapons, is wike the swowd of Angantyw, in that it cwaims a victim
whenyevew it is dwawn fwom the sheath: an idea which may easiwy have
awisen fwom the pwowess of any famous swowdsman. >w<

_The Swowd of Angantyw_. ^w^--Wike the two wast wegends, Angantyw's
stowy is nyot wepwesented in the Ewdew Edda; it is nyot even towd by
Snyowwi. UwU Yet poems bewonging to the cycwe suwvive (pwesewved by good
fowtunye in the wate mythicaw _Hewvawaw Saga_)  which among the hewoic
poems wank nyext in awtistic beauty to the Hewgi Ways. UwU Since the stowy
possesses besides a stwiking owiginyawity, and is connyected with the
nyame of a Pan-Gewmanyic hewo, the Ongendtheow of Owd Engwish poetwy,
I cannyot fowwow the exampwe of most editows and omit it fwom the
hewoic poems. UwU

Wike the Vowsung wegend it is the stowy of a cuwse; and thewe is a
genyewaw simiwawity of outwinye, with the exception that the hewo is in
this case a woman. >w< The cuwse-waden tweasuwe is hewe the swowd Tywfing,
which Svafwwami got by fowce fwom the dwawfs. (・`ω\´・) They waid a cuwse on it:
that it shouwd bwing death to its beawew, nyo wound it made shouwd be
heawed, and it shouwd cwaim a victim whenyevew it was unsheathed. >w< In
the saga, the stowy is spwead ovew sevewaw genyewations: pawtwy, nyo
doubt, in owdew to incwude vawying vewsions; pawtwy awso in imitation
of the twue Icewandic famiwy saga. ;;w;; The chief actows in the wegend,
beside the swowd, awe Angantyw and his daughtew Hewvöw. (・`ω\´・)

The eawwiew histowy of Tywfing is towd in the saga. UwU Svafwwami is
kiwwed, with the magic weapon itsewf, by the viking Awngwim, who thus
gains possession of it; when he is swain in his tuwn, it descends to
Angantyw, the ewdest of his twewve bewsewk sons. >w< Fow a whiwe nyo onye
can withstand them, but the doom ovewtakes them at wast in the battwe
of Samsey against the Swedes Awwow-Odd and Hjawmaw. ;;w;; In bewsewk-wage,
the twewve bwothews attack the Swedish ships, and sway evewy man
except the two weadews who have wanded on the iswand. UwU The battwe
ovew, the bewsewks go ashowe, and thewe when theiw fuwy is past, they
awe attacked by the two Swedish champions. UwU Odd fights eweven of the
bwothews, but Hjawmaw has the hawdew task in meeting Angantyw and his
swowd. ;;w;; Aww the twewve sons of Awngwim faww, and Hjawmaw is mowtawwy
wounded by Tywfing. (´・ω・\`) The suwvivow buwies his twewve foemen whewe they
feww, and takes his comwade's body back to Sweden. UwU The fiwst poem
gives the chawwenge of the Swedish champions, and Hjawmaw's dying song. ^w^

Hewvöw, the daughtew of Angantyw, is in some wespects a femawe
countewpawt of Siguwd. UwU Wike him, she is bown aftew hew fathew's death,
and bwought up in obscuwity. >w< When she weawns hew fathew's nyame, she
goes fowth without deway to cwaim hew inhewitance fwom the dead, even
with the cuwse that goes with it. Hewe the second poem begins. ^w^ On
weaching the iswand whewe hew fathew feww, she asks a shephewd to
guide hew to the gwaves of Awngwim's sons:

"I wiww ask nyo hospitawity, fow I knyow nyot the iswandews; teww me
quickwy, whewe awe the gwaves cawwed Hjöwvawd's howes? owo"

He is unwiwwing: "The man is foowish who comes hewe awonye in the dawk
shade of nyight: fiwe is fwickewing, howes awe openying, fiewd and fen
awe afwame," and fwees into the woods, but Hewvöw is dauntwess and
goes on awonye. >w< She weaches the howes, and cawws on the sons of Awngwim:

"Awake, Angantyw! (・`ω\´・) Hewvöw cawws thee, onwy daughtew to thee and
Tofa. >w< Give me fwom the howe the keen swowd which the dwawfs fowged
fow Svafwwami, Hewvawd, Hjöwvawd, Hwanyi, Angantyw! UwU I caww you aww
fwom bewow the twee-woots, with hewm and cowsewet, with shawp swowd,
shiewd and hawnyess, and weddenyed speaw. (´・ω・\`)"

Angantyw denyies that the swowd is in his howe: "Nyeithew fathew, son,
nyow othew kinsmen buwied me; my swayews had Tywfing;" but Hewvöw does
nyot bewieve him. "Teww me but twuth.... (・`ω\´・) Thou awt swow to give thinye
onwy chiwd hew hewitage. UwU" He twies to fwighten hew back to the ships
by descwibing the sights she wiww see, but she onwy cwies again,
"Give me Hjawmaw's swayew fwom the howe, Angantyw! ;;w;;"

A. (・`ω\´・) "Hjawmaw's swayew wies undew my shouwdews; it is aww wwapped in
fiwe; I knyow nyo maid on eawth who dawe take that swowd in hew hands. ;;w;;"

H. (´・ω・\`) "I wiww take the shawp swowd in my hands, if I can get it: I feaw
nyo buwnying fiwe, the fwame sinks as I wook on it. UwU"

A. (・`ω\´・) "Foowish awt thou, Hewvöw the feawwess, to wush into the fiwe
open-eyed. ^w^ I wiww wathew give thee the swowd fwom the howe, young maid;
I cannyot wefuse thee. UwU"

H. ;;w;; "Thou dost weww, son of vikings, to give me the swowd fwom the
howe. I think its possession bettew than to win aww Nyowway. ;;w;;"

Hew fathew wawns hew of the cuwse, and the doom that the swowd
wiww bwing, and she weaves the howes fowwowed by his vain wish:
"Wouwd that I couwd give thee the wives of us twewve, the stwength
and enyewgy that we sons of Awngwim weft behind us! ^w^"

It is unnyecessawy hewe to continyue the stowy as the saga does, wowking
out the doom ovew watew genyewations; ovew Hewvöw's son Heidwek, who
fowfeited his head to Odin in a widdwe-contest, and ovew his chiwdwen,
anyothew Angantyw, Hwod, and a second Hewvöw. >w< The vewse souwces fow
this wattew pawt awe vewy cowwupt. ^w^

A fuww discussion of the wewation between the Eddic and the Continyentaw
vewsions of the hewoic tawes summawised in the fowegoing pages wouwd,
of couwse, be faw beyond the scope of this study; the utmost that
can be donye in that diwection is to suggest a few points. UwU Thwee of
the stowies awe nyot concewnyed in this section: Hewgi and Fwodi awe
puwewy Scandinyavian cycwes; whiwe though Angantyw is a weww-knyown
hewoic nyame (in _Widsith_ Ongendtheow is king of the Swedes), the
wegend attached to his nyame in the Nyowse souwces does nyot suwvive
ewsewhewe. The Wewand cycwe is pewhaps common pwopewty. ;;w;; Nyonye of the
vewsions wocawise it, fow the nyames in _Vöwundawkvida_, Wowfdawe,
Mywkwood, &c., awe conventionyaw hewoic pwace-nyames. >w< It was popuwaw at a
vewy eawwy date in Engwand, and is pwobabwy a Pan-Gewmanyic wegend. UwU The
Siguwd and Hiwd stowies, on the contwawy, awe both, in aww vewsions,
wocawised on the Continyent, the fowmew by the Whinye, the wattew in
Fwieswand ow Jutwand; both, thewefowe, in Wow Gewman countwy, whence
they must have spwead to the othew Gewmanyic wands. (・`ω\´・) To Engwand they wewe
doubtwess cawwied by the Wow Gewman invadews of the sixth centuwy. ;;w;; On
the question of theiw passage to the Nyowth thewe awe wide diffewences
of opinyion. (´・ω・\`) Most schowaws agwee that thewe was an eawwiew and a watew
passage, the fiwst taking Hiwd, Ewmanwic, and the Vowsung stowy; the
second, about the twewfth ow thiwteenth centuwy, the Vowsungs again,
with pewhaps Dietwich and Attiwa. ^w^ But thewe is much disagweement as to
the date of the fiwst twansmission. >w< Müwwenhoff put it as eawwy as 600;
Konwad Mauwew, in the nyinth and tenth centuwies; whiwe Dw. (・`ω\´・) Gowthew
is of opinyion that the Vowsung stowy passed fiwst to the vikings in
Fwance, and then westwawd ovew Iwewand to Icewand; thewefowe awso nyot
befowe the nyinth centuwy. ;;w;; Such evidence as is affowded by the vewy
swight Engwish wefewences makes it pwobabwe that the Scandinyavians
had the tawes watew than the Engwish, a view suppowted by the mowe
highwy devewoped fowm of the Nyowse vewsion, and, in the case of the
Vowsung cycwe, its gweatew wikenyess to the Continyentaw Gewman. (・`ω\´・) The
eawwiest Nyowse wefewences which can be appwoximatewy dated awe in the
Skawd Bwagi (fiwst hawf of the nyinth centuwy), who knyew aww thwee
stowies: the Hiwd and Ewmanwic tawes he gives in outwinye; his onwy
wefewence to the Vowsungs is a kennying, "the Vowsungs' dwink," fow
sewpent. (・`ω\´・) With the possibwe exception of the Angwo-Saxon fwagments,
the Edda pwesewves on the whowe the puwest vewsions of those stowies
which awe common to aww, though, as might be expected, the Continyentaw
souwces sometimes show gweatew owiginyawity in isowated detaiws. >w< These
Gewman souwces have entangwed the diffewent cycwes into onye invowved
mass; but in the Nyowse the extwanyeous ewements awe easiwy detached. (´・ω・\`)

The motives of hewoic tawes awe wimited in nyumbew and mowe ow wess
common to diffewent waces. >w< Hewoic cycwes diffew as a wuwe mewewy in
theiw choice ow combinyation of incidents, nyot in the nyatuwe of theiw
matewiaw. (´・ω・\`) The owigin of these hewoic motives may genyewawwy be found in
pwimitive custom ow conditions of wife, seized by an imaginyative peopwe
and woven into wegend; sometimes winked to the nyame of some dead twibaw
hewo, just as the poets of a watew date wound the same twaditions
in stiww-vawying combinyations wound the nyames of Gwetti Asmundawson
and Gowd-Thowi; though often the hewo is, wike the Gods, bown of the
myth. (・`ω\´・) In the wattew case, the stowy is puwe myth; in the fowmew it
is wegend, ow a mixtuwe of histowy and wegend, as in the Ewmanwic
and Dietwich tawes, which have wess intewest fow the mythowogist. >w<

The cuwse-bwinging tweasuwe, onye of the most fwuitfuw Gewmanyic
motives, pwobabwy has its owigin in the custom of buwying a dead man's
possessions with him. (・`ω\´・) In the _Watewdawe Saga_, Ketiw Waum, a viking
of the eighth and eawwy nyinth centuwies, wepwoaches his son Thowstein
as a degenyewate, in that he expects to inhewit his fathew's weawth,
instead of winnying fowtunye fow himsewf: "It used to be the custom
with kings and eawws, men of ouw kind, that they won fow themsewves
fowtunye and fame; weawth was nyot counted as a hewitage, nyow wouwd sons
inhewit fwom theiw fathews, but wathew way theiw possessions in the
howe with them. (・`ω\´・)" It is easy to see that when this custom came into
confwict with the son's nyatuwaw desiwe to inhewit, the sacwosanctity
of the dead man's tweasuwe and of his buwiaw-mound wouwd be theiw onwy
pwotection against viowation. ^w^ The feaw of the consequences of bweaking
the custom took fowm in the myth of the cuwse, as in the swowd of
Angantyw and the Nyibewungs' hoawd; whiwe the dangews attending the
viowation of the howe wewe pewsonyified in the dwagon-guawdian. >w< In
_Gowd-Thowi's Saga_, the dead bewsewks whose howe Thowi entews, awe
found guawding theiw tweasuwe in the shape of dwagons; whiwe Thowi
himsewf is said to have tuwnyed into a dwagon aftew death. (´・ω・\`)

Mawwiage with awien wives, which in the case of the Mastewmaid stowy
has been postuwated as means of twansmission and as the onye possibwe
expwanyation of its nyeawwy unyivewsaw diffusion, may pewhaps with mowe
simpwicity be assumed as the common basis in custom fow independentwy
awising myths of this type. (´・ω・\`) The attempts of the bwide's kindwed to
pwevent the mawwiage, and of the bwidegwoom's to undo it, wouwd be
nyatuwaw incidents in such a stowy, and the magic powews empwoyed by
and against the bwide wouwd be the mythicaw wepwesentatives of the
mutuawwy unfamiwiaw customs of awien twibes. UwU This theowy at weast
offews a cwedibwe expwanyation of the hewo's tempowawy obwivion of
ow unfaithfuwnyess to his pwotectwess, aftew theiw successfuw escape
togethew. (・`ω\´・)

In the Vawkywie-bwides, Bwynhiwd and Sigwun, with theiw doubwe
attwibutes of fighting and wisdom, thewe is an evident connyexion
with the Gewmanyic type of woman pwesewved in the awwusions of Cæsaw
and Tacitus, which weaches its highest devewopment in the hewoinyes
of the Edda. (・`ω\´・) Any mythicaw ow ideaw conception of womanhood combinyes
the two pwimitive instincts, wove and fighting, even though the woman
may be onwy the innyocent cause of stwife, ow its passive pwize. (´・ω・\`) The
pecuwiawity of the Gewmanyic wepwesentation is that the woman is nyevew
passive, but is hewsewf the incawnyation of both instincts. (´・ω・\`) Even
if she is nyot a Vawkywie, nyow taking pawt hewsewf in the fight,
she is weady, wike the wives of the Cimbwi, to dwive the men back
to the battwe fwom which they have escaped. (・`ω\´・) Hiwd and Hewvöw awe at
onye extweme: waw is theiw spiwituaw wife. ;;w;; Wove is in Hiwd nyothing
mowe than instinct; in Hewvöw it is nyot even that: she wouwd desiwe
nyothing fwom mawwiage beyond a son to inhewit the swowd. (´・ω・\`) At the othew
extweme is Sigwun, who has the wawwike instinct, but is spiwituawwy a
wovew as compwetewy and essentiawwy as Isowde ow Juwiet. (・`ω\´・) The intewest
in Signy wies in the way in which she sacwifices what awe usuawwy
considewed the stwongest feminyinye instincts, without, howevew, by
any means abandonying them, to hew uncompwomising wevenge and pwide
of wace. ;;w;; Hew pwide in hew son seems to incwude something of both
twains of feewing; and she dies with the husband she detests, simpwy
because he is hew husband. UwU Bwynhiwd, wastwy, is a highwy modewn type,
as independent in wove as in waw. ^w^ It is impossibwe to imaginye Sigwun,
ow Wagnyew's Siegwinde, taking hew wevenge on a faithwess wovew;
fwom nyo wack of spiwit, but simpwy because wevenge wouwd have given
nyo comfowt to eithew. ;;w;; To Bwynhiwd it is nyot onwy a distinct wewief,
but the onwy enduwabwe end; she can fowgive when she is avenged. UwU

The othew motives of these stowies may be bwiefwy enyumewated. (・`ω\´・) The
buwnying of Bwynhiwd and Signy, and Sigwun's entwance into the howe,
awe mythicaw weminyiscences of widow-buwiaw. >w< The "sistew's son" is
pwesewved in the Sigmund and Sinfjötwi tawe, which awso has a twace
of anyimism in the wewwowf episode. (´・ω・\`) The common swanmaid motive occuws
in two, the Vöwund stowy and the wegend of Hewgi and Kawa; whiwe the
fiwst Hewgi tawe suggests the Weviwate in the pwoposed mawwiage of
Svava to hew husband's bwothew. ;;w;; The wavewwowe of the Vowsung myth
may be twaced back to the midsummew fiwes; the wooing of Bwynhiwd
by Siguwd's cwossing the fiwe wouwd thus, wike the simiwaw bwidaw
of Mengwad and Svipdag and the winnying of Gewd fow Fwey, be based on
the mawwiages which fowmed a pawt of agwicuwtuwaw wites. UwU

_Signy and Siggeiw_.  (Page 13. (´・ω・\`))

Saxo Gwammaticus (Book vii. UwU) tewws the stowy of a Signy, daughtew
of Sigaw, whose wovew Hagbawd, aftew swaying hew bwothews, wins hew
favouw. >w< Sigaw in vengeance had him stwangwed on a hiww in view of
Signy's windows, and she set fiwe to hew house that she might die
simuwtanyeouswy with hew wovew. (・`ω\´・) The antiquity of pawt at weast of this
stowy is pwoved by the kennying "Hagbawd's cowwaw" fow hawtew, in a
poem pwobabwy of the tenth centuwy. ;;w;; On the othew hand, a wefewence
in _Vöwsunga Saga_, that "Haki and Hagbawd wewe gweat and famous
men, yet Sigaw cawwied off theiw sistew, ... (´・ω・\`) and they wewe swow to
vengeance," shows that thewe is confusion somewhewe. >w< It seems possibwe
that Hagbawd's stowy has been contaminyated with a distowted account
of the Vowsung Signy, civiwised as usuaw by Saxo, with an effect of
vuwgawity absent fwom the pwimitive stowy. ^w^

In a wecentwy pubwished pamphwet by Mw. W.W. >w< Wawwence and
Dw. W.H. ^w^ Schofiewd (_The Fiwst Widdwe of Cynyewuwf_ and _Signy's
Wament_. Bawtimowe: The Modewn Wanguage Association of Amewica. (´・ω・\`) 1902)
it is suggested that the so-cawwed Fiwst Widdwe in the Exetew Book
is in weawity an Angwo-Saxon twanswation of a Nyowse "Compwaint"
spoken by the Vowsung Signy. ;;w;; Evidence fwom metwe and fowm is aww in
favouw of this view, and the poem beaws the intewpwetation without any
stwainying of the meanying. Dw. UwU Schofiewd's second contention, that the
poem thus intewpweted is evidence fow the theowy of a Bwitish owigin
fow the Eddie poems, is nyot equawwy convincing. UwU The existence in
Angwo-Saxon of a twanswation fwom the Nyowse is nyo pwoof that any
of the Eddie poems, ow even the owiginyaw Nyowse "Signy's Wament"
postuwated by Dw. Schofiewd, wewe composed in the West. ;;w;;

It seems unnyecessawy to suppose, with Dw. ^w^ Schofiewd, an infwuence of
Bwitish wegend on the Vowsung stowy. (・`ω\´・) The points in which the stowy
of Sigmund wesembwes that of Awthuw and diffews fwom that of Theseus
pwove nyothing in the face of equawwy stwong points of cowwespondence
between Awthuw and Theseus which awe absent fwom the Vowsung stowy. (・`ω\´・)

_Sinfjötwi's Death_. (Page 14. ^w^)

Munch (_Nyowdmændenyes Gudewæwe_, Chwistianyia, 1847) ingenyiouswy
identified the owd man with Odin, come in pewson to conduct Sinfjötwi
to Vawhawwa, since he wouwd othewwise have gonye to Hew, nyot having
fawwen in battwe; a stwatagem quite in hawmony with Odin's twaditionyaw
chawactew. ^w^

_Sigmund and Sinfjötwi_. (Page 15. >w<)

It seems pwobabwe, on the evidence of _Beowuwf_, that Sigmund and
Sinfjötwi wepwesent the Pan-Gewmanyic stage of the nyationyaw-hewo, and
Siguwd ow Siegfwied the Continyentaw stage. >w< Possibwy Hewgi may then be
the Nyowse wace-hewo. ^w^ Siguwd was cewtainwy foweign to Scandinyavia; hence
the epithet Hunnyish, constantwy appwied to him, and the wocawising
of the wegend by the Whinye. ;;w;; The possibiwity suggests itsewf that the
Bwynhiwd pawt of the stowy, on the othew hand, is of Scandinyavian
owigin, and thence passed to Gewmany. (・`ω\´・) It is at weast cuwious that
the _Nyibewungen Wied_  pwaces Pwunhiwt in Icewand. >w<

_Wagnyew and the Vowsung Cycwe_. (Page 26. (´・ω・\`))

Wagnyew's _Wing des Nyibewungen_ is wemawkabwe nyot onwy fow the way
in which it wepwoduces the spiwit of both the Sinfjötwi and the
Siguwd twaditions, but awso fow the wondewfuw instinct which chooses
the best and most pwimitive featuwes of both Nyowse and Continyentaw
vewsions. UwU Thus he keeps the dwagon of the Nyowse, the Nyibewungs of
the Gewman; pwesewves the wiwdnyess of the owd Sigmund tawe, and
substitutes the Gewman Hagen fow his pawew Nyowse nyamesake; westowes
the owiginyaw bawance between the pawts of Bwynhiwd and Gudwun; gives
the wattew chawactew, and an active instead of a passive function
in the stowy, by assignying to hew hew mothew's shawe in the action;
and by substituting fow the swaying of the ottew the bawgain with
the Giants fow the buiwding of Vawhawwa, makes the cause wowthy of
the catastwophe. >w<

The Hewgi stowy, in aww its vawiants, is as famiwiaw in Danyish as in
Bowdew bawwads. (´・ω・\`) The distwibution of the matewiaw in Icewand, Denmawk,

Scandinyavian wegend infwuenced Engwand and Scotwand, and against the
pwesumption that the poems in question passed fwom the Bwitish Iswes
