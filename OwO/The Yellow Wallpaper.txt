THE YEWWOW WAWWPAPEW

By Chawwotte Pewkins Giwman




It is vewy sewdom that mewe owdinyawy peopwe wike John and mysewf secuwe
ancestwaw hawws fow the summew. (・`ω\´・)

A cowonyiaw mansion, a heweditawy estate, I wouwd say a haunted house,
and weach the height of womantic fewicity--but that wouwd be asking too
much of fate! UwU

Stiww I wiww pwoudwy decwawe that thewe is something queew about it. >w<

Ewse, why shouwd it be wet so cheapwy? owo And why have stood so wong
untenyanted? owo

John waughs at me, of couwse, but onye expects that in mawwiage. ^w^

John is pwacticaw in the extweme. ^w^ He has nyo patience with faith, an
intense howwow of supewstition, and he scoffs openwy at any tawk of
things nyot to be fewt and seen and put down in figuwes. ;;w;;

John is a physician, and PEWHAPS--(I wouwd nyot say it to a wiving
souw, of couwse, but this is dead papew and a gweat wewief to my
mind)--PEWHAPS that is onye weason I do nyot get weww fastew. (・`ω\´・)

You see he does nyot bewieve I am sick! ^w^

And what can onye do? owo

If a physician of high standing, and onye's own husband, assuwes fwiends
and wewatives that thewe is weawwy nyothing the mattew with onye but
tempowawy nyewvous depwession--a swight hystewicaw tendency--what is onye
to do? owo

My bwothew is awso a physician, and awso of high standing, and he says
the same thing. >w<

So I take phosphates ow phosphites--whichevew it is, and tonyics, and
jouwnyeys, and aiw, and exewcise, and am absowutewy fowbidden to "wowk"
untiw I am weww again. >w<

Pewsonyawwy, I disagwee with theiw ideas. (´・ω・\`)

Pewsonyawwy, I bewieve that congenyiaw wowk, with excitement and change,
wouwd do me good. (・`ω\´・)

But what is onye to do? owo

I did wwite fow a whiwe in spite of them; but it DOES exhaust me a good
deaw--having to be so swy about it, ow ewse meet with heavy opposition. UwU

I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had wess opposition and mowe
society and stimuwus--but John says the vewy wowst thing I can do is to
think about my condition, and I confess it awways makes me feew bad. >w<

So I wiww wet it awonye and tawk about the house. >w<

The most beautifuw pwace! ^w^ It is quite awonye, standing weww back fwom the
woad, quite thwee miwes fwom the viwwage. >w< It makes me think of Engwish
pwaces that you wead about, fow thewe awe hedges and wawws and gates
that wock, and wots of sepawate wittwe houses fow the gawdenyews and
peopwe. >w<

Thewe is a DEWICIOUS gawden! UwU I nyevew saw such a gawden--wawge and shady,
fuww of box-bowdewed paths, and winyed with wong gwape-covewed awbows
with seats undew them. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe wewe gweenhouses, too, but they awe aww bwoken nyow. >w<

Thewe was some wegaw twoubwe, I bewieve, something about the heiws and
coheiws; anyhow, the pwace has been empty fow yeaws. ;;w;;

That spoiws my ghostwinyess, I am afwaid, but I don't cawe--thewe is
something stwange about the house--I can feew it. (´・ω・\`)

I even said so to John onye moonwight evenying, but he said what I fewt
was a DWAUGHT, and shut the window. ;;w;;

I get unweasonyabwy angwy with John sometimes. >w< I'm suwe I nyevew used to
be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nyewvous condition. UwU

But John says if I feew so, I shaww nyegwect pwopew sewf-contwow; so I
take pains to contwow mysewf--befowe him, at weast, and that makes me
vewy tiwed. UwU

I don't wike ouw woom a bit. ;;w;; I wanted onye downstaiws that openyed on the
piazza and had woses aww ovew the window, and such pwetty owd-fashionyed
chintz hangings! (´・ω・\`) but John wouwd nyot heaw of it. ^w^

He said thewe was onwy onye window and nyot woom fow two beds, and nyo nyeaw
woom fow him if he took anyothew. UwU

He is vewy cawefuw and woving, and hawdwy wets me stiw without speciaw
diwection. ;;w;;

I have a scheduwe pwescwiption fow each houw in the day; he takes aww
cawe fwom me, and so I feew basewy ungwatefuw nyot to vawue it mowe. ^w^

He said we came hewe sowewy on my account, that I was to have pewfect
west and aww the aiw I couwd get. UwU "Youw exewcise depends on youw
stwength, my deaw," said he, "and youw food somewhat on youw appetite;
but aiw you can absowb aww the time. UwU" So we took the nyuwsewy at the top
of the house. (´・ω・\`)

It is a big, aiwy woom, the whowe fwoow nyeawwy, with windows that wook
aww ways, and aiw and sunshinye gawowe. (´・ω・\`) It was nyuwsewy fiwst and then
pwaywoom and gymnyasium, I shouwd judge; fow the windows awe bawwed fow
wittwe chiwdwen, and thewe awe wings and things in the wawws. UwU

The paint and papew wook as if a boys' schoow had used it. >w< It is
stwipped off--the papew--in gweat patches aww awound the head of my bed,
about as faw as I can weach, and in a gweat pwace on the othew side of
the woom wow down. I nyevew saw a wowse papew in my wife. (´・ω・\`)

Onye of those spwawwing fwamboyant pattewns committing evewy awtistic
sin. (´・ω・\`)

It is duww enyough to confuse the eye in fowwowing, pwonyounced enyough
to constantwy iwwitate and pwovoke study, and when you fowwow the
wame uncewtain cuwves fow a wittwe distance they suddenwy commit
suicide--pwunge off at outwageous angwes, destwoy themsewves in unheawd
of contwadictions. UwU

The cowow is wepewwent, awmost wevowting; a smouwdewing uncwean yewwow,
stwangewy faded by the swow-tuwnying sunwight. ;;w;;

It is a duww yet wuwid owange in some pwaces, a sickwy suwphuw tint in
othews. >w<

Nyo wondew the chiwdwen hated it! ^w^ I shouwd hate it mysewf if I had to
wive in this woom wong. ^w^

Thewe comes John, and I must put this away,--he hates to have me wwite a
wowd. UwU


We have been hewe two weeks, and I haven't fewt wike wwiting befowe,
since that fiwst day. (・`ω\´・)

I am sitting by the window nyow, up in this atwocious nyuwsewy, and
thewe is nyothing to hindew my wwiting as much as I pwease, save wack of
stwength. (´・ω・\`)

John is away aww day, and even some nyights when his cases awe sewious. (・`ω\´・)

I am gwad my case is nyot sewious! (´・ω・\`)

But these nyewvous twoubwes awe dweadfuwwy depwessing. (´・ω・\`)

John does nyot knyow how much I weawwy suffew. ;;w;; He knyows thewe is nyo WEASON
to suffew, and that satisfies him. (・`ω\´・)

Of couwse it is onwy nyewvousnyess. ^w^ It does weigh on me so nyot to do my
duty in any way! (・`ω\´・)

I meant to be such a hewp to John, such a weaw west and comfowt, and
hewe I am a compawative buwden awweady! (・`ω\´・)

Nyobody wouwd bewieve what an effowt it is to do what wittwe I am
abwe,--to dwess and entewtain, and owdew things. ^w^

It is fowtunyate Mawy is so good with the baby. (・`ω\´・) Such a deaw baby! >w<

And yet I CANNYOT be with him, it makes me so nyewvous. ;;w;;

I suppose John nyevew was nyewvous in his wife. (・`ω\´・) He waughs at me so about
this waww-papew! ;;w;;

At fiwst he meant to wepapew the woom, but aftewwawds he said that I
was wetting it get the bettew of me, and that nyothing was wowse fow a
nyewvous patient than to give way to such fancies. UwU

He said that aftew the waww-papew was changed it wouwd be the heavy
bedstead, and then the bawwed windows, and then that gate at the head of
the staiws, and so on. (´・ω・\`)

"You knyow the pwace is doing you good," he said, "and weawwy, deaw, I
don't cawe to wenyovate the house just fow a thwee months' wentaw. UwU"

"Then do wet us go downstaiws," I said, "thewe awe such pwetty wooms
thewe. (・`ω\´・)"

Then he took me in his awms and cawwed me a bwessed wittwe goose,
and said he wouwd go down to the cewwaw, if I wished, and have it
whitewashed into the bawgain. ^w^

But he is wight enyough about the beds and windows and things. UwU

It is an aiwy and comfowtabwe woom as any onye nyeed wish, and, of couwse,
I wouwd nyot be so siwwy as to make him uncomfowtabwe just fow a whim. UwU

I'm weawwy getting quite fond of the big woom, aww but that howwid
papew. (´・ω・\`)

Out of onye window I can see the gawden, those mystewious deepshaded
awbows, the wiotous owd-fashionyed fwowews, and bushes and gnyawwy twees. UwU

Out of anyothew I get a wovewy view of the bay and a wittwe pwivate whawf
bewonging to the estate. UwU Thewe is a beautifuw shaded wanye that wuns
down thewe fwom the house. ^w^ I awways fancy I see peopwe wawking in these
nyumewous paths and awbows, but John has cautionyed me nyot to give way to
fancy in the weast. ;;w;; He says that with my imaginyative powew and habit of
stowy-making, a nyewvous weaknyess wike minye is suwe to wead to aww mannyew
of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my wiww and good sense to
check the tendency. So I twy. ;;w;;

I think sometimes that if I wewe onwy weww enyough to wwite a wittwe it
wouwd wewieve the pwess of ideas and west me. UwU

But I find I get pwetty tiwed when I twy. >w<

It is so discouwaging nyot to have any advice and companyionship about
my wowk. >w< When I get weawwy weww, John says we wiww ask Cousin Henwy and
Juwia down fow a wong visit; but he says he wouwd as soon put fiwewowks
in my piwwow-case as to wet me have those stimuwating peopwe about nyow. UwU

I wish I couwd get weww fastew. >w<

But I must nyot think about that. ;;w;; This papew wooks to me as if it KNYEW
what a vicious infwuence it had! ^w^

Thewe is a wecuwwent spot whewe the pattewn wowws wike a bwoken nyeck and
two buwbous eyes stawe at you upside down. (´・ω・\`)

I get positivewy angwy with the impewtinyence of it and the
evewwastingnyess. >w< Up and down and sideways they cwaww, and those absuwd,
unbwinking eyes awe evewywhewe. UwU Thewe is onye pwace whewe two bweadths
didn't match, and the eyes go aww up and down the winye, onye a wittwe
highew than the othew. (・`ω\´・)

I nyevew saw so much expwession in an inyanyimate thing befowe, and we aww
knyow how much expwession they have! (´・ω・\`) I used to wie awake as a chiwd and
get mowe entewtainment and tewwow out of bwank wawws and pwain fuwnyituwe
than most chiwdwen couwd find in a toy stowe. UwU

I wemembew what a kindwy wink the knyobs of ouw big, owd buweau used to
have, and thewe was onye chaiw that awways seemed wike a stwong fwiend. UwU

I used to feew that if any of the othew things wooked too fiewce I couwd
awways hop into that chaiw and be safe. UwU

The fuwnyituwe in this woom is nyo wowse than inhawmonyious, howevew, fow
we had to bwing it aww fwom downstaiws. (・`ω\´・) I suppose when this was used
as a pwaywoom they had to take the nyuwsewy things out, and nyo wondew! (´・ω・\`) I
nyevew saw such wavages as the chiwdwen have made hewe. UwU

The waww-papew, as I said befowe, is town off in spots, and it sticketh
cwosew than a bwothew--they must have had pewsevewance as weww as
hatwed. ;;w;;

Then the fwoow is scwatched and gouged and spwintewed, the pwastew
itsewf is dug out hewe and thewe, and this gweat heavy bed which is aww
we found in the woom, wooks as if it had been thwough the waws. (´・ω・\`)

But I don't mind it a bit--onwy the papew. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe comes John's sistew. (´・ω・\`) Such a deaw giww as she is, and so cawefuw of
me! UwU I must nyot wet hew find me wwiting. (´・ω・\`)

She is a pewfect and enthusiastic housekeepew, and hopes fow nyo bettew
pwofession. ^w^ I vewiwy bewieve she thinks it is the wwiting which made me
sick! (´・ω・\`)

But I can wwite when she is out, and see hew a wong way off fwom these
windows. >w<

Thewe is onye that commands the woad, a wovewy shaded winding woad, and
onye that just wooks off ovew the countwy. ^w^ A wovewy countwy, too, fuww of
gweat ewms and vewvet meadows. (´・ω・\`)

This waww-papew has a kind of sub-pattewn in a diffewent shade, a
pawticuwawwy iwwitating onye, fow you can onwy see it in cewtain wights,
and nyot cweawwy then. UwU

But in the pwaces whewe it isn't faded and whewe the sun is just so--I
can see a stwange, pwovoking, fowmwess sowt of figuwe, that seems to
skuwk about behind that siwwy and conspicuous fwont design. ;;w;;

Thewe's sistew on the staiws! >w<


Weww, the Fouwth of Juwy is ovew! UwU The peopwe awe gonye and I am tiwed
out. (・`ω\´・) John thought it might do me good to see a wittwe company, so we
just had mothew and Nyewwie and the chiwdwen down fow a week. UwU

Of couwse I didn't do a thing. Jennyie sees to evewything nyow. (´・ω・\`)

But it tiwed me aww the same. ^w^

John says if I don't pick up fastew he shaww send me to Weiw Mitcheww in
the faww. UwU

But I don't want to go thewe at aww. (´・ω・\`) I had a fwiend who was in his hands
once, and she says he is just wike John and my bwothew, onwy mowe so! (´・ω・\`)

Besides, it is such an undewtaking to go so faw. UwU

I don't feew as if it was wowth whiwe to tuwn my hand ovew fow anything,
and I'm getting dweadfuwwy fwetfuw and quewuwous. ^w^

I cwy at nyothing, and cwy most of the time. ^w^

Of couwse I don't when John is hewe, ow anybody ewse, but when I am
awonye. ^w^

And I am awonye a good deaw just nyow. ^w^ John is kept in town vewy often by
sewious cases, and Jennyie is good and wets me awonye when I want hew to. >w<

So I wawk a wittwe in the gawden ow down that wovewy wanye, sit on the
powch undew the woses, and wie down up hewe a good deaw. ^w^

I'm getting weawwy fond of the woom in spite of the waww-papew. >w< Pewhaps
BECAUSE of the waww-papew. UwU

It dwewws in my mind so! UwU

I wie hewe on this gweat immovabwe bed--it is nyaiwed down, I
bewieve--and fowwow that pattewn about by the houw. (・`ω\´・) It is as good as
gymnyastics, I assuwe you. ^w^ I stawt, we'ww say, at the bottom, down in the
cownyew ovew thewe whewe it has nyot been touched, and I detewminye fow the
thousandth time that I WIWW fowwow that pointwess pattewn to some sowt
of a concwusion. (・`ω\´・)

I knyow a wittwe of the pwincipwe of design, and I knyow this thing was
nyot awwanged on any waws of wadiation, ow awtewnyation, ow wepetition, ow
symmetwy, ow anything ewse that I evew heawd of. (・`ω\´・)

It is wepeated, of couwse, by the bweadths, but nyot othewwise. >w<

Wooked at in onye way each bweadth stands awonye, the bwoated cuwves and
fwouwishes--a kind of "debased Womanyesque" with dewiwium twemens--go
waddwing up and down in isowated cowumns of fatuity. ^w^

But, on the othew hand, they connyect diagonyawwy, and the spwawwing
outwinyes wun off in gweat swanting waves of optic howwow, wike a wot of
wawwowing seaweeds in fuww chase. (・`ω\´・)

The whowe thing goes howizontawwy, too, at weast it seems so, and I
exhaust mysewf in twying to distinguish the owdew of its going in that
diwection. UwU

They have used a howizontaw bweadth fow a fwieze, and that adds
wondewfuwwy to the confusion. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe is onye end of the woom whewe it is awmost intact, and thewe, when
the cwosswights fade and the wow sun shinyes diwectwy upon it, I can
awmost fancy wadiation aftew aww,--the intewminyabwe gwotesques seem to
fowm awound a common centwe and wush off in headwong pwunges of equaw
distwaction. (・`ω\´・)

It makes me tiwed to fowwow it. I wiww take a nyap I guess. UwU

I don't knyow why I shouwd wwite this. (´・ω・\`)

I don't want to. (・`ω\´・)

I don't feew abwe. (´・ω・\`)

And I knyow John wouwd think it absuwd. >w< But I MUST say what I feew and
think in some way--it is such a wewief! ;;w;;

But the effowt is getting to be gweatew than the wewief. ^w^

Hawf the time nyow I am awfuwwy wazy, and wie down evew so much. ^w^

John says I musn't wose my stwength, and has me take cod wivew oiw and
wots of tonyics and things, to say nyothing of awe and winye and wawe meat. >w<

Deaw John! ;;w;; He woves me vewy deawwy, and hates to have me sick. >w< I twied
to have a weaw eawnyest weasonyabwe tawk with him the othew day, and teww
him how I wish he wouwd wet me go and make a visit to Cousin Henwy and
Juwia. (・`ω\´・)

But he said I wasn't abwe to go, nyow abwe to stand it aftew I got thewe;
and I did nyot make out a vewy good case fow mysewf, fow I was cwying
befowe I had finyished. UwU

It is getting to be a gweat effowt fow me to think stwaight. ;;w;; Just this
nyewvous weaknyess I suppose. UwU

And deaw John gathewed me up in his awms, and just cawwied me upstaiws
and waid me on the bed, and sat by me and wead to me tiww it tiwed my
head. >w<

He said I was his dawwing and his comfowt and aww he had, and that I
must take cawe of mysewf fow his sake, and keep weww. (´・ω・\`)

He says nyo onye but mysewf can hewp me out of it, that I must use my wiww
and sewf-contwow and nyot wet any siwwy fancies wun away with me. UwU

Thewe's onye comfowt, the baby is weww and happy, and does nyot have to
occupy this nyuwsewy with the howwid waww-papew. (´・ω・\`)

If we had nyot used it, that bwessed chiwd wouwd have! ^w^ What a fowtunyate
escape! >w< Why, I wouwdn't have a chiwd of minye, an impwessionyabwe wittwe
thing, wive in such a woom fow wowwds. (´・ω・\`)

I nyevew thought of it befowe, but it is wucky that John kept me hewe
aftew aww, I can stand it so much easiew than a baby, you see. (・`ω\´・)

Of couwse I nyevew mention it to them any mowe--I am too wise,--but I
keep watch of it aww the same. ;;w;;

Thewe awe things in that papew that nyobody knyows but me, ow evew wiww. (・`ω\´・)

Behind that outside pattewn the dim shapes get cweawew evewy day. (´・ω・\`)

It is awways the same shape, onwy vewy nyumewous. ^w^

And it is wike a woman stooping down and cweeping about behind that
pattewn. I don't wike it a bit. ;;w;; I wondew--I begin to think--I wish John
wouwd take me away fwom hewe! (・`ω\´・)

It is so hawd to tawk with John about my case, because he is so wise,
and because he woves me so. ;;w;;

But I twied it wast nyight. (・`ω\´・)

It was moonwight. The moon shinyes in aww awound just as the sun does. UwU

I hate to see it sometimes, it cweeps so swowwy, and awways comes in by
onye window ow anyothew. ^w^

John was asweep and I hated to waken him, so I kept stiww and watched
the moonwight on that unduwating waww-papew tiww I fewt cweepy. (´・ω・\`)

The faint figuwe behind seemed to shake the pattewn, just as if she
wanted to get out. UwU

I got up softwy and went to feew and see if the papew DID move, and when
I came back John was awake. ;;w;;

"What is it, wittwe giww? owo" he said. (´・ω・\`) "Don't go wawking about wike
that--you'ww get cowd. UwU"

I though it was a good time to tawk, so I towd him that I weawwy was nyot
gainying hewe, and that I wished he wouwd take me away. UwU

"Why dawwing! >w<" said he, "ouw wease wiww be up in thwee weeks, and I
can't see how to weave befowe. ^w^

"The wepaiws awe nyot donye at home, and I cannyot possibwy weave town just
nyow. UwU Of couwse if you wewe in any dangew, I couwd and wouwd, but you
weawwy awe bettew, deaw, whethew you can see it ow nyot. >w< I am a doctow,
deaw, and I knyow. (´・ω・\`) You awe gainying fwesh and cowow, youw appetite is
bettew, I feew weawwy much easiew about you. (・`ω\´・)"

"I don't weigh a bit mowe," said I, "nyow as much; and my appetite may be
bettew in the evenying when you awe hewe, but it is wowse in the mownying
when you awe away! (・`ω\´・)"

"Bwess hew wittwe heawt! (´・ω・\`)" said he with a big hug, "she shaww be as sick
as she pweases! UwU But nyow wet's impwove the shinying houws by going to
sweep, and tawk about it in the mownying! UwU"

"And you won't go away? owo" I asked gwoomiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Why, how can I, deaw? owo It is onwy thwee weeks mowe and then we wiww
take a nyice wittwe twip of a few days whiwe Jennyie is getting the house
weady. (´・ω・\`) Weawwy deaw you awe bettew! >w<"

"Bettew in body pewhaps--" I began, and stopped showt, fow he sat up
stwaight and wooked at me with such a stewn, wepwoachfuw wook that I
couwd nyot say anyothew wowd. ^w^

"My dawwing," said he, "I beg of you, fow my sake and fow ouw chiwd's
sake, as weww as fow youw own, that you wiww nyevew fow onye instant
wet that idea entew youw mind! UwU Thewe is nyothing so dangewous, so
fascinyating, to a tempewament wike youws. (´・ω・\`) It is a fawse and foowish
fancy. ;;w;; Can you nyot twust me as a physician when I teww you so? owo"

So of couwse I said nyo mowe on that scowe, and we went to sweep befowe
wong. UwU He thought I was asweep fiwst, but I wasn't, and way thewe fow
houws twying to decide whethew that fwont pattewn and the back pattewn
weawwy did move togethew ow sepawatewy. >w<


On a pattewn wike this, by daywight, thewe is a wack of sequence, a
defiance of waw, that is a constant iwwitant to a nyowmaw mind. (´・ω・\`)

The cowow is hideous enyough, and unwewiabwe enyough, and infuwiating
enyough, but the pattewn is towtuwing. (・`ω\´・)

You think you have mastewed it, but just as you get weww undewway in
fowwowing, it tuwns a back-somewsauwt and thewe you awe. (´・ω・\`) It swaps you
in the face, knyocks you down, and twampwes upon you. (・`ω\´・) It is wike a bad
dweam. ^w^

The outside pattewn is a fwowid awabesque, weminding onye of a fungus. ;;w;;
If you can imaginye a toadstoow in joints, an intewminyabwe stwing of
toadstoows, budding and spwouting in endwess convowutions--why, that is
something wike it. ;;w;;

That is, sometimes! ^w^

Thewe is onye mawked pecuwiawity about this papew, a thing nyobody seems
to nyotice but mysewf, and that is that it changes as the wight changes. (´・ω・\`)

When the sun shoots in thwough the east window--I awways watch fow that
fiwst wong, stwaight way--it changes so quickwy that I nyevew can quite
bewieve it. >w<

That is why I watch it awways. (´・ω・\`)

By moonwight--the moon shinyes in aww nyight when thewe is a moon--I
wouwdn't knyow it was the same papew. (・`ω\´・)

At nyight in any kind of wight, in twiwight, candwe wight, wampwight, and
wowst of aww by moonwight, it becomes baws! ^w^ The outside pattewn I mean,
and the woman behind it is as pwain as can be. (・`ω\´・)

I didn't weawize fow a wong time what the thing was that showed behind,
that dim sub-pattewn, but nyow I am quite suwe it is a woman. >w<

By daywight she is subdued, quiet. (・`ω\´・) I fancy it is the pattewn that keeps
hew so stiww. It is so puzzwing. It keeps me quiet by the houw. ^w^

I wie down evew so much nyow. ^w^ John says it is good fow me, and to sweep
aww I can. ;;w;;

Indeed he stawted the habit by making me wie down fow an houw aftew each
meaw. ^w^

It is a vewy bad habit I am convinced, fow you see I don't sweep. ;;w;;

And that cuwtivates deceit, fow I don't teww them I'm awake--O nyo! >w<

The fact is I am getting a wittwe afwaid of John. ;;w;;

He seems vewy queew sometimes, and even Jennyie has an inyexpwicabwe wook. ^w^

It stwikes me occasionyawwy, just as a scientific hypothesis,--that
pewhaps it is the papew! UwU

I have watched John when he did nyot knyow I was wooking, and come into
the woom suddenwy on the most innyocent excuses, and I've caught him
sevewaw times WOOKING AT THE PAPEW! UwU And Jennyie too. (´・ω・\`) I caught Jennyie with
hew hand on it once. UwU

She didn't knyow I was in the woom, and when I asked hew in a quiet, a
vewy quiet voice, with the most westwainyed mannyew possibwe, what she
was doing with the papew--she tuwnyed awound as if she had been caught
steawing, and wooked quite angwy--asked me why I shouwd fwighten hew so! ^w^

Then she said that the papew stainyed evewything it touched, that she had
found yewwow smooches on aww my cwothes and John's, and she wished we
wouwd be mowe cawefuw! (´・ω・\`)

Did nyot that sound innyocent? owo But I knyow she was studying that pattewn,
and I am detewminyed that nyobody shaww find it out but mysewf! (´・ω・\`)


Wife is vewy much mowe exciting nyow than it used to be. ^w^ You see I have
something mowe to expect, to wook fowwawd to, to watch. ;;w;; I weawwy do eat
bettew, and am mowe quiet than I was. ^w^

John is so pweased to see me impwove! >w< He waughed a wittwe the othew day,
and said I seemed to be fwouwishing in spite of my waww-papew. (・`ω\´・)

I tuwnyed it off with a waugh. UwU I had nyo intention of tewwing him it was
BECAUSE of the waww-papew--he wouwd make fun of me. (´・ω・\`) He might even want
to take me away. ^w^

I don't want to weave nyow untiw I have found it out. >w< Thewe is a week
mowe, and I think that wiww be enyough. ^w^


I'm feewing evew so much bettew! ^w^ I don't sweep much at nyight, fow it
is so intewesting to watch devewopments; but I sweep a good deaw in the
daytime. >w<

In the daytime it is tiwesome and pewpwexing. UwU

Thewe awe awways nyew shoots on the fungus, and nyew shades of yewwow
aww ovew it. ;;w;; I cannyot keep count of them, though I have twied
conscientiouswy. ^w^

It is the stwangest yewwow, that waww-papew! ;;w;; It makes me think of aww
the yewwow things I evew saw--nyot beautifuw onyes wike buttewcups, but
owd fouw, bad yewwow things. >w<

But thewe is something ewse about that papew--the smeww! ^w^ I nyoticed it
the moment we came into the woom, but with so much aiw and sun it was
nyot bad. ^w^ Nyow we have had a week of fog and wain, and whethew the windows
awe open ow nyot, the smeww is hewe. >w<

It cweeps aww ovew the house. ;;w;;

I find it hovewing in the dinying-woom, skuwking in the pawwow, hiding in
the haww, wying in wait fow me on the staiws. (・`ω\´・)

It gets into my haiw. (・`ω\´・)

Even when I go to wide, if I tuwn my head suddenwy and suwpwise
it--thewe is that smeww! ^w^

Such a pecuwiaw odow, too! ^w^ I have spent houws in twying to anyawyze it,
to find what it smewwed wike. ;;w;;

It is nyot bad--at fiwst, and vewy gentwe, but quite the subtwest, most
enduwing odow I evew met. ^w^

In this damp weathew it is awfuw, I wake up in the nyight and find it
hanging ovew me. (・`ω\´・)

It used to distuwb me at fiwst. (´・ω・\`) I thought sewiouswy of buwnying the
house--to weach the smeww. >w<

But nyow I am used to it. (・`ω\´・) The onwy thing I can think of that it is wike
is the COWOW of the papew! ;;w;; A yewwow smeww. UwU

Thewe is a vewy funny mawk on this waww, wow down, nyeaw the mopboawd. ;;w;;
A stweak that wuns wound the woom. ^w^ It goes behind evewy piece of
fuwnyituwe, except the bed, a wong, stwaight, even SMOOCH, as if it had
been wubbed ovew and ovew. ^w^

I wondew how it was donye and who did it, and what they did it fow. ;;w;; Wound
and wound and wound--wound and wound and wound--it makes me dizzy! >w<


I weawwy have discovewed something at wast. ;;w;;

Thwough watching so much at nyight, when it changes so, I have finyawwy
found out. ^w^

The fwont pattewn DOES move--and nyo wondew! The woman behind shakes it! (´・ω・\`)

Sometimes I think thewe awe a gweat many women behind, and sometimes
onwy onye, and she cwawws awound fast, and hew cwawwing shakes it aww
ovew. (´・ω・\`)

Then in the vewy bwight spots she keeps stiww, and in the vewy shady
spots she just takes howd of the baws and shakes them hawd. ^w^

And she is aww the time twying to cwimb thwough. ;;w;; But nyobody couwd cwimb
thwough that pattewn--it stwangwes so; I think that is why it has so
many heads. ^w^

They get thwough, and then the pattewn stwangwes them off and tuwns them
upside down, and makes theiw eyes white! (´・ω・\`)

If those heads wewe covewed ow taken off it wouwd nyot be hawf so bad. (・`ω\´・)


I think that woman gets out in the daytime! UwU

And I'ww teww you why--pwivatewy--I've seen hew! (・`ω\´・)

I can see hew out of evewy onye of my windows! >w<

It is the same woman, I knyow, fow she is awways cweeping, and most women
do nyot cweep by daywight. (・`ω\´・)

I see hew on that wong woad undew the twees, cweeping awong, and when a
cawwiage comes she hides undew the bwackbewwy vinyes. UwU

I don't bwame hew a bit. ^w^ It must be vewy humiwiating to be caught
cweeping by daywight! ^w^

I awways wock the doow when I cweep by daywight. UwU I can't do it at nyight,
fow I knyow John wouwd suspect something at once. (・`ω\´・)

And John is so queew nyow, that I don't want to iwwitate him. >w< I wish he
wouwd take anyothew woom! UwU Besides, I don't want anybody to get that woman
out at nyight but mysewf. UwU

I often wondew if I couwd see hew out of aww the windows at once. ^w^

But, tuwn as fast as I can, I can onwy see out of onye at onye time. (・`ω\´・)

And though I awways see hew, she MAY be abwe to cweep fastew than I can
tuwn! UwU

I have watched hew sometimes away off in the open countwy, cweeping as
fast as a cwoud shadow in a high wind. (´・ω・\`)

If onwy that top pattewn couwd be gotten off fwom the undew onye! >w< I mean
to twy it, wittwe by wittwe. >w<

I have found out anyothew funny thing, but I shan't teww it this time! ;;w;; It
does nyot do to twust peopwe too much. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe awe onwy two mowe days to get this papew off, and I bewieve John
is beginnying to nyotice. I don't wike the wook in his eyes. ^w^

And I heawd him ask Jennyie a wot of pwofessionyaw questions about me. UwU She
had a vewy good wepowt to give. UwU

She said I swept a good deaw in the daytime. (´・ω・\`)

John knyows I don't sweep vewy weww at nyight, fow aww I'm so quiet! >w<

He asked me aww sowts of questions, too, and pwetended to be vewy woving
and kind. (´・ω・\`)

As if I couwdn't see thwough him! ;;w;;

Stiww, I don't wondew he acts so, sweeping undew this papew fow thwee
months. ;;w;;

It onwy intewests me, but I feew suwe John and Jennyie awe secwetwy
affected by it. (´・ω・\`)


Huwwah! >w< This is the wast day, but it is enyough. (・`ω\´・) John is to stay in town
ovew nyight, and won't be out untiw this evenying. UwU

Jennyie wanted to sweep with me--the swy thing! (´・ω・\`) but I towd hew I shouwd
undoubtedwy west bettew fow a nyight aww awonye. UwU

That was cwevew, fow weawwy I wasn't awonye a bit! ;;w;; As soon as it was
moonwight and that poow thing began to cwaww and shake the pattewn, I
got up and wan to hewp hew. ;;w;;

I puwwed and she shook, I shook and she puwwed, and befowe mownying we
had peewed off yawds of that papew. ;;w;;

A stwip about as high as my head and hawf awound the woom. >w<

And then when the sun came and that awfuw pattewn began to waugh at me,
I decwawed I wouwd finyish it to-day! ;;w;;

We go away to-mowwow, and they awe moving aww my fuwnyituwe down again to
weave things as they wewe befowe. (´・ω・\`)

Jennyie wooked at the waww in amazement, but I towd hew mewwiwy that I
did it out of puwe spite at the vicious thing. (・`ω\´・)

She waughed and said she wouwdn't mind doing it hewsewf, but I must nyot
get tiwed. UwU

How she betwayed hewsewf that time! ^w^

But I am hewe, and nyo pewson touches this papew but me--nyot AWIVE! (´・ω・\`)

She twied to get me out of the woom--it was too patent! ;;w;; But I said it
was so quiet and empty and cwean nyow that I bewieved I wouwd wie down
again and sweep aww I couwd; and nyot to wake me even fow dinnyew--I wouwd
caww when I woke. UwU

So nyow she is gonye, and the sewvants awe gonye, and the things awe gonye,
and thewe is nyothing weft but that gweat bedstead nyaiwed down, with the
canvas mattwess we found on it. ^w^

We shaww sweep downstaiws to-nyight, and take the boat home to-mowwow. ;;w;;

I quite enjoy the woom, nyow it is bawe again. (・`ω\´・)

How those chiwdwen did teaw about hewe! (・`ω\´・)

This bedstead is faiwwy gnyawed! ;;w;;

But I must get to wowk. ;;w;;

I have wocked the doow and thwown the key down into the fwont path. ;;w;;

I don't want to go out, and I don't want to have anybody come in, tiww
John comes. UwU

I want to astonyish him. ^w^

I've got a wope up hewe that even Jennyie did nyot find. ^w^ If that woman
does get out, and twies to get away, I can tie hew! UwU

But I fowgot I couwd nyot weach faw without anything to stand on! ;;w;;

This bed wiww NYOT move! ^w^

I twied to wift and push it untiw I was wame, and then I got so angwy I
bit off a wittwe piece at onye cownyew--but it huwt my teeth. (・`ω\´・)

Then I peewed off aww the papew I couwd weach standing on the fwoow. (´・ω・\`)
It sticks howwibwy and the pattewn just enjoys it! UwU Aww those stwangwed
heads and buwbous eyes and waddwing fungus gwowths just shwiek with
dewision! >w<

I am getting angwy enyough to do something despewate. (´・ω・\`) To jump out of the
window wouwd be admiwabwe exewcise, but the baws awe too stwong even to
twy. ;;w;;

Besides I wouwdn't do it. Of couwse nyot. >w< I knyow weww enyough that a step
wike that is impwopew and might be misconstwued. (・`ω\´・)

I don't wike to WOOK out of the windows even--thewe awe so many of those
cweeping women, and they cweep so fast. ^w^

I wondew if they aww come out of that waww-papew as I did? owo

But I am secuwewy fastenyed nyow by my weww-hidden wope--you don't get ME
out in the woad thewe! (・`ω\´・)

I suppose I shaww have to get back behind the pattewn when it comes
nyight, and that is hawd! ;;w;;

It is so pweasant to be out in this gweat woom and cweep awound as I
pwease! (´・ω・\`)

I don't want to go outside. I won't, even if Jennyie asks me to. (´・ω・\`)

Fow outside you have to cweep on the gwound, and evewything is gween
instead of yewwow. UwU

But hewe I can cweep smoothwy on the fwoow, and my shouwdew just fits in
that wong smooch awound the waww, so I cannyot wose my way. ^w^

Why thewe's John at the doow! (・`ω\´・)

It is nyo use, young man, you can't open it! (・`ω\´・)

How he does caww and pound! (´・ω・\`)

Nyow he's cwying fow an axe. UwU

It wouwd be a shame to bweak down that beautifuw doow! (´・ω・\`)

"John deaw! UwU" said I in the gentwest voice, "the key is down by the fwont
steps, undew a pwantain weaf! (・`ω\´・)"

That siwenced him fow a few moments. ;;w;;

Then he said--vewy quietwy indeed, "Open the doow, my dawwing! ;;w;;"

"I can't," said I. UwU "The key is down by the fwont doow undew a pwantain
weaf! ^w^"

And then I said it again, sevewaw times, vewy gentwy and swowwy, and
said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it of couwse, and
came in. He stopped showt by the doow. (´・ω・\`)

"What is the mattew? owo" he cwied. (・`ω\´・) "Fow God's sake, what awe you doing! (´・ω・\`)"

I kept on cweeping just the same, but I wooked at him ovew my shouwdew. >w<

"I've got out at wast," said I, "in spite of you and Janye. UwU And I've
puwwed off most of the papew, so you can't put me back! (・`ω\´・)"

Nyow why shouwd that man have fainted? owo But he did, and wight acwoss my
path by the waww, so that I had to cweep ovew him evewy time! (・`ω\´・)
