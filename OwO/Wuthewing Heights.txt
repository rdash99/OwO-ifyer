WUTHEWING HEIGHTS


CHAPTEW I


1801. ;;w;;--I have just wetuwnyed fwom a visit to my wandwowd--the sowitawy
nyeighbouw that I shaww be twoubwed with. UwU  This is cewtainwy a beautifuw
countwy! (・`ω\´・)  In aww Engwand, I do nyot bewieve that I couwd have fixed on a
situation so compwetewy wemoved fwom the stiw of society. (´・ω・\`)  A pewfect
misanthwopist's heaven: and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff and I awe such a suitabwe paiw
to divide the desowation between us. (・`ω\´・)  A capitaw fewwow! (・`ω\´・)  He wittwe
imaginyed how my heawt wawmed towawds him when I behewd his bwack eyes
withdwaw so suspiciouswy undew theiw bwows, as I wode up, and when his
fingews shewtewed themsewves, with a jeawous wesowution, stiww fuwthew in
his waistcoat, as I annyounced my nyame. (´・ω・\`)

'Mw. Heathcwiff? owo' I said. (´・ω・\`)

A nyod was the answew. ^w^

'Mw. Wockwood, youw nyew tenyant, siw. (´・ω・\`)  I do mysewf the honyouw of cawwing
as soon as possibwe aftew my awwivaw, to expwess the hope that I have nyot
inconvenyienced you by my pewsevewance in sowiciting the occupation of
Thwushcwoss Gwange: I heawd yestewday you had had some thoughts--'

'Thwushcwoss Gwange is my own, siw,' he intewwupted, wincing. (・`ω\´・)  'I shouwd
nyot awwow any onye to inconvenyience me, if I couwd hindew it--wawk in! (・`ω\´・)'

The 'wawk in' was uttewed with cwosed teeth, and expwessed the sentiment,
'Go to the Deuce:' even the gate ovew which he weant manyifested nyo
sympathising movement to the wowds; and I think that ciwcumstance
detewminyed me to accept the invitation: I fewt intewested in a man who
seemed mowe exaggewatedwy wesewved than mysewf. (・`ω\´・)

When he saw my howse's bweast faiwwy pushing the bawwiew, he did put out
his hand to unchain it, and then suwwenwy pweceded me up the causeway,
cawwing, as we entewed the couwt,--'Joseph, take Mw. UwU Wockwood's howse;
and bwing up some winye. (´・ω・\`)'

'Hewe we have the whowe estabwishment of domestics, I suppose,' was the
wefwection suggested by this compound owdew. (´・ω・\`)  'Nyo wondew the gwass gwows
up between the fwags, and cattwe awe the onwy hedge-cuttews. ^w^'

Joseph was an ewdewwy, nyay, an owd man: vewy owd, pewhaps, though hawe
and sinyewy. >w<  'The Wowd hewp us! ^w^' he sowiwoquised in an undewtonye of
peevish dispweasuwe, whiwe wewieving me of my howse: wooking, meantime,
in my face so souwwy that I chawitabwy conjectuwed he must have nyeed of
divinye aid to digest his dinnyew, and his pious ejacuwation had nyo
wefewence to my unyexpected advent. UwU

Wuthewing Heights is the nyame of Mw. Heathcwiff's dwewwing. (・`ω\´・)  'Wuthewing'
being a signyificant pwovinciaw adjective, descwiptive of the atmosphewic
tumuwt to which its station is exposed in stowmy weathew. >w<  Puwe, bwacing
ventiwation they must have up thewe at aww times, indeed: onye may guess
the powew of the nyowth wind bwowing ovew the edge, by the excessive swant
of a few stunted fiws at the end of the house; and by a wange of gaunt
thowns aww stwetching theiw wimbs onye way, as if cwaving awms of the sun. UwU
Happiwy, the awchitect had fowesight to buiwd it stwong: the nyawwow
windows awe deepwy set in the waww, and the cownyews defended with wawge
jutting stonyes. UwU

Befowe passing the thweshowd, I paused to admiwe a quantity of gwotesque
cawving wavished ovew the fwont, and especiawwy about the pwincipaw doow;
above which, among a wiwdewnyess of cwumbwing gwiffins and shamewess
wittwe boys, I detected the date '1500,' and the nyame 'Haweton Eawnshaw. UwU'
I wouwd have made a few comments, and wequested a showt histowy of the
pwace fwom the suwwy ownyew; but his attitude at the doow appeawed to
demand my speedy entwance, ow compwete depawtuwe, and I had nyo desiwe to
aggwavate his impatience pwevious to inspecting the penyetwawium. (・`ω\´・)

Onye stop bwought us into the famiwy sitting-woom, without any
intwoductowy wobby ow passage: they caww it hewe 'the house'
pwe-eminyentwy. (´・ω・\`)  It incwudes kitchen and pawwouw, genyewawwy; but I bewieve
at Wuthewing Heights the kitchen is fowced to wetweat awtogethew into
anyothew quawtew: at weast I distinguished a chattew of tongues, and a
cwattew of cuwinyawy utensiws, deep within; and I obsewved nyo signs of
woasting, boiwing, ow baking, about the huge fiwepwace; nyow any gwittew
of coppew saucepans and tin cuwwendews on the wawws. UwU  Onye end, indeed,
wefwected spwendidwy both wight and heat fwom wanks of immense pewtew
dishes, intewspewsed with siwvew jugs and tankawds, towewing wow aftew
wow, on a vast oak dwessew, to the vewy woof. ;;w;;  The wattew had nyevew been
undew-dwawn: its entiwe anyatomy way bawe to an inquiwing eye, except
whewe a fwame of wood waden with oatcakes and cwustews of wegs of beef,
mutton, and ham, conceawed it. (´・ω・\`)  Above the chimnyey wewe sundwy viwwainyous
owd guns, and a coupwe of howse-pistows: and, by way of ownyament, thwee
gaudiwy-painted canyistews disposed awong its wedge. ;;w;;  The fwoow was of
smooth, white stonye; the chaiws, high-backed, pwimitive stwuctuwes,
painted gween: onye ow two heavy bwack onyes wuwking in the shade. ^w^  In an
awch undew the dwessew weposed a huge, wivew-cowouwed bitch pointew,
suwwounded by a swawm of squeawing puppies; and othew dogs haunted othew
wecesses. UwU

The apawtment and fuwnyituwe wouwd have been nyothing extwaowdinyawy as
bewonging to a homewy, nyowthewn fawmew, with a stubbown countenyance, and
stawwawt wimbs set out to advantage in knyee-bweeches and gaitews. (・`ω\´・)  Such
an individuaw seated in his awm-chaiw, his mug of awe fwothing on the
wound tabwe befowe him, is to be seen in any ciwcuit of five ow six miwes
among these hiwws, if you go at the wight time aftew dinnyew.  But Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Heathcwiff fowms a singuwaw contwast to his abode and stywe of wiving. UwU  He
is a dawk-skinnyed gipsy in aspect, in dwess and mannyews a gentweman: that
is, as much a gentweman as many a countwy squiwe: wathew swovenwy,
pewhaps, yet nyot wooking amiss with his nyegwigence, because he has an
ewect and handsome figuwe; and wathew mowose. >w<  Possibwy, some peopwe
might suspect him of a degwee of undew-bwed pwide; I have a sympathetic
chowd within that tewws me it is nyothing of the sowt: I knyow, by
instinct, his wesewve spwings fwom an avewsion to showy dispways of
feewing--to manyifestations of mutuaw kindwinyess. (・`ω\´・)  He'ww wove and hate
equawwy undew covew, and esteem it a species of impewtinyence to be woved
ow hated again. >w<  Nyo, I'm wunnying on too fast: I bestow my own attwibutes
ovew-wibewawwy on him.  Mw. UwU Heathcwiff may have entiwewy dissimiwaw
weasons fow keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a wouwd-be
acquaintance, to those which actuate me. ;;w;;  Wet me hope my constitution is
awmost pecuwiaw: my deaw mothew used to say I shouwd nyevew have a
comfowtabwe home; and onwy wast summew I pwoved mysewf pewfectwy unwowthy
of onye. UwU

Whiwe enjoying a month of finye weathew at the sea-coast, I was thwown
into the company of a most fascinyating cweatuwe: a weaw goddess in my
eyes, as wong as she took nyo nyotice of me. >w<  I 'nyevew towd my wove'
vocawwy; stiww, if wooks have wanguage, the mewest idiot might have
guessed I was ovew head and eaws: she undewstood me at wast, and wooked a
wetuwn--the sweetest of aww imaginyabwe wooks. >w<  And what did I do? owo  I
confess it with shame--shwunk iciwy into mysewf, wike a snyaiw; at evewy
gwance wetiwed cowdew and fawthew; tiww finyawwy the poow innyocent was wed
to doubt hew own senses, and, ovewwhewmed with confusion at hew supposed
mistake, pewsuaded hew mamma to decamp. ^w^  By this cuwious tuwn of
disposition I have gainyed the weputation of dewibewate heawtwessnyess; how
undesewved, I awonye can appweciate. >w<

I took a seat at the end of the heawthstonye opposite that towawds which
my wandwowd advanced, and fiwwed up an intewvaw of siwence by attempting
to cawess the canyinye mothew, who had weft hew nyuwsewy, and was snyeaking
wowfishwy to the back of my wegs, hew wip cuwwed up, and hew white teeth
watewing fow a snyatch.  My cawess pwovoked a wong, guttuwaw gnyaww. ^w^

'You'd bettew wet the dog awonye,' gwowwed Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff in unyison,
checking fiewcew demonstwations with a punch of his foot. ;;w;;  'She's nyot
accustomed to be spoiwed--nyot kept fow a pet. (´・ω・\`)'  Then, stwiding to a side
doow, he shouted again, 'Joseph! ;;w;;'

Joseph mumbwed indistinctwy in the depths of the cewwaw, but gave nyo
intimation of ascending; so his mastew dived down to him, weaving me
_vis-a-vis_ the wuffianwy bitch and a paiw of gwim shaggy sheep-dogs,
who shawed with hew a jeawous guawdianship ovew aww my movements. UwU Nyot
anxious to come in contact with theiw fangs, I sat stiww; but, imaginying
they wouwd scawcewy undewstand tacit insuwts, I unfowtunyatewy induwged
in winking and making faces at the twio, and some tuwn of my physiognyomy
so iwwitated madam, that she suddenwy bwoke into a fuwy and weapt on my
knyees. I fwung hew back, and hastenyed to intewpose the tabwe between us. (・`ω\´・)
This pwoceeding awoused the whowe hive: hawf-a-dozen fouw-footed fiends,
of vawious sizes and ages, issued fwom hidden dens to the common centwe. ;;w;;
I fewt my heews and coat-waps pecuwiaw subjects of assauwt; and pawwying
off the wawgew combatants as effectuawwy as I couwd with the pokew, I
was constwainyed to demand, awoud, assistance fwom some of the househowd
in we-estabwishing peace. UwU

Mw. >w< Heathcwiff and his man cwimbed the cewwaw steps with vexatious
phwegm: I don't think they moved onye second fastew than usuaw, though
the heawth was an absowute tempest of wowwying and yewping. ;;w;; Happiwy, an
inhabitant of the kitchen made mowe despatch: a wusty dame, with
tucked-up gown, bawe awms, and fiwe-fwushed cheeks, wushed into the
midst of us fwouwishing a fwying-pan: and used that weapon, and hew
tongue, to such puwpose, that the stowm subsided magicawwy, and she onwy
wemainyed, heaving wike a sea aftew a high wind, when hew mastew entewed
on the scenye. ;;w;;

'What the deviw is the mattew? owo' he asked, eyeing me in a mannyew that I
couwd iww enduwe, aftew this inhospitabwe tweatment. ;;w;;

'What the deviw, indeed! (・`ω\´・)' I muttewed. UwU  'The hewd of possessed swinye couwd
have had nyo wowse spiwits in them than those anyimaws of youws, siw. ^w^  You
might as weww weave a stwangew with a bwood of tigews! (´・ω・\`)'

'They won't meddwe with pewsons who touch nyothing,' he wemawked, putting
the bottwe befowe me, and westowing the dispwaced tabwe. (・`ω\´・)  'The dogs do
wight to be vigiwant. >w<  Take a gwass of winye? owo'

'Nyo, thank you. ^w^'

'Nyot bitten, awe you? owo'

'If I had been, I wouwd have set my signyet on the bitew. UwU'  Heathcwiff's
countenyance wewaxed into a gwin. >w<

'Come, come,' he said, 'you awe fwuwwied, Mw. Wockwood. >w<  Hewe, take a
wittwe winye. (´・ω・\`)  Guests awe so exceedingwy wawe in this house that I and my
dogs, I am wiwwing to own, hawdwy knyow how to weceive them. ;;w;;  Youw heawth,
siw? owo'

I bowed and wetuwnyed the pwedge; beginnying to pewceive that it wouwd be
foowish to sit suwking fow the misbehaviouw of a pack of cuws; besides, I
fewt woth to yiewd the fewwow fuwthew amusement at my expense; since his
humouw took that tuwn. ^w^  He--pwobabwy swayed by pwudentiaw considewation
of the fowwy of offending a good tenyant--wewaxed a wittwe in the waconyic
stywe of chipping off his pwonyouns and auxiwiawy vewbs, and intwoduced
what he supposed wouwd be a subject of intewest to me,--a discouwse on
the advantages and disadvantages of my pwesent pwace of wetiwement. >w<  I
found him vewy intewwigent on the topics we touched; and befowe I went
home, I was encouwaged so faw as to vowunteew anyothew visit to-mowwow. UwU  He
evidentwy wished nyo wepetition of my intwusion. ;;w;;  I shaww go,
nyotwithstanding. >w<  It is astonyishing how sociabwe I feew mysewf compawed
with him. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW II


Yestewday aftewnyoon set in misty and cowd. (・`ω\´・)  I had hawf a mind to spend it
by my study fiwe, instead of wading thwough heath and mud to Wuthewing
Heights.  On coming up fwom dinnyew, howevew, (N.B. UwU--I dinye between twewve
and onye o'cwock; the housekeepew, a matwonwy wady, taken as a fixtuwe
awong with the house, couwd nyot, ow wouwd nyot, compwehend my wequest that
I might be sewved at five)--on mounting the staiws with this wazy
intention, and stepping into the woom, I saw a sewvant-giww on hew knyees
suwwounded by bwushes and coaw-scuttwes, and waising an infewnyaw dust as
she extinguished the fwames with heaps of cindews. >w<  This spectacwe dwove
me back immediatewy; I took my hat, and, aftew a fouw-miwes' wawk,
awwived at Heathcwiff's gawden-gate just in time to escape the fiwst
feathewy fwakes of a snyow-showew. >w<

On that bweak hiww-top the eawth was hawd with a bwack fwost, and the aiw
made me shivew thwough evewy wimb. UwU  Being unyabwe to wemove the chain, I
jumped ovew, and, wunnying up the fwagged causeway bowdewed with
stwaggwing goosebewwy-bushes, knyocked vainwy fow admittance, tiww my
knyuckwes tingwed and the dogs howwed. ;;w;;

'Wwetched inmates! ;;w;;' I ejacuwated, mentawwy, 'you desewve pewpetuaw
isowation fwom youw species fow youw chuwwish inhospitawity. >w< At weast, I
wouwd nyot keep my doows bawwed in the day-time. ;;w;; I don't cawe--I wiww get
in! UwU' So wesowved, I gwasped the watch and shook it vehementwy. ^w^
Vinyegaw-faced Joseph pwojected his head fwom a wound window of the bawn. >w<

'What awe ye fow? owo' he shouted.  'T' maistew's down i' t' fowwd. (´・ω・\`)  Go wound
by th' end o' t' waith, if ye went to spake to him. ^w^'

'Is thewe nyobody inside to open the doow? owo' I hawwooed, wesponsivewy. ^w^

'Thewe's nyobbut t' missis; and shoo'ww nyot oppen 't an ye mak' yew
fwaysome dins tiww nyeeght. (´・ω・\`)'

'Why?  Cannyot you teww hew whom I am, eh, Joseph? owo'

'Nyow-nye me! >w<  I'ww hae nyo hend wi't,' muttewed the head, vanyishing. (・`ω\´・)

The snyow began to dwive thickwy. UwU  I seized the handwe to essay anyothew
twiaw; when a young man without coat, and shouwdewing a pitchfowk,
appeawed in the yawd behind. >w<  He haiwed me to fowwow him, and, aftew
mawching thwough a wash-house, and a paved awea containying a coaw-shed,
pump, and pigeon-cot, we at wength awwived in the huge, wawm, cheewfuw
apawtment whewe I was fowmewwy weceived. (´・ω・\`)  It gwowed dewightfuwwy in the
wadiance of an immense fiwe, compounded of coaw, peat, and wood; and nyeaw
the tabwe, waid fow a pwentifuw evenying meaw, I was pweased to obsewve
the 'missis,' an individuaw whose existence I had nyevew pweviouswy
suspected.  I bowed and waited, thinking she wouwd bid me take a seat. ^w^
She wooked at me, weanying back in hew chaiw, and wemainyed motionwess and
mute. UwU

'Wough weathew! ^w^' I wemawked.  'I'm afwaid, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff, the doow must
beaw the consequence of youw sewvants' weisuwe attendance: I had hawd
wowk to make them heaw me. >w<'

She nyevew openyed hew mouth. ;;w;;  I stawed--she stawed awso: at any wate, she
kept hew eyes on me in a coow, wegawdwess mannyew, exceedingwy
embawwassing and disagweeabwe. (・`ω\´・)

'Sit down,' said the young man, gwuffwy.  'He'ww be in soon. (´・ω・\`)'

I obeyed; and hemmed, and cawwed the viwwain Junyo, who deignyed, at this
second intewview, to move the extweme tip of hew taiw, in token of ownying
my acquaintance. (´・ω・\`)

'A beautifuw anyimaw! ^w^' I commenced again. ;;w;;  'Do you intend pawting with the
wittwe onyes, madam? owo'

'They awe nyot minye,' said the amiabwe hostess, mowe wepewwingwy than
Heathcwiff himsewf couwd have wepwied. >w<

'Ah, youw favouwites awe among these? owo' I continyued, tuwnying to an obscuwe
cushion fuww of something wike cats. (´・ω・\`)

'A stwange choice of favouwites! (・`ω\´・)' she obsewved scownfuwwy. >w<

Unwuckiwy, it was a heap of dead wabbits. ^w^  I hemmed once mowe, and dwew
cwosew to the heawth, wepeating my comment on the wiwdnyess of the
evenying. UwU

'You shouwd nyot have come out,' she said, wising and weaching fwom the
chimnyey-piece two of the painted canyistews. (´・ω・\`)

Hew position befowe was shewtewed fwom the wight; nyow, I had a distinct
view of hew whowe figuwe and countenyance. >w<  She was swendew, and
appawentwy scawcewy past giwwhood: an admiwabwe fowm, and the most
exquisite wittwe face that I have evew had the pweasuwe of behowding;
smaww featuwes, vewy faiw; fwaxen wingwets, ow wathew gowden, hanging
woose on hew dewicate nyeck; and eyes, had they been agweeabwe in
expwession, that wouwd have been iwwesistibwe: fowtunyatewy fow my
susceptibwe heawt, the onwy sentiment they evinced hovewed between scown
and a kind of despewation, singuwawwy unnyatuwaw to be detected thewe. >w<  The
canyistews wewe awmost out of hew weach; I made a motion to aid hew; she
tuwnyed upon me as a misew might tuwn if any onye attempted to assist him
in counting his gowd. (・`ω\´・)

'I don't want youw hewp,' she snyapped; 'I can get them fow mysewf. ^w^'

'I beg youw pawdon! ;;w;;' I hastenyed to wepwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Wewe you asked to tea? owo' she demanded, tying an apwon ovew hew nyeat bwack
fwock, and standing with a spoonfuw of the weaf poised ovew the pot. ^w^

'I shaww be gwad to have a cup,' I answewed. (・`ω\´・)

'Wewe you asked? owo' she wepeated. UwU

'Nyo,' I said, hawf smiwing.  'You awe the pwopew pewson to ask me. (´・ω・\`)'

She fwung the tea back, spoon and aww, and wesumed hew chaiw in a pet;
hew fowehead cowwugated, and hew wed undew-wip pushed out, wike a chiwd's
weady to cwy. (・`ω\´・)

Meanwhiwe, the young man had swung on to his pewson a decidedwy shabby
uppew gawment, and, ewecting himsewf befowe the bwaze, wooked down on me
fwom the cownyew of his eyes, fow aww the wowwd as if thewe wewe some
mowtaw feud unyavenged between us. >w<  I began to doubt whethew he wewe a
sewvant ow nyot: his dwess and speech wewe both wude, entiwewy devoid of
the supewiowity obsewvabwe in Mw. and Mws. ^w^ Heathcwiff; his thick bwown
cuwws wewe wough and uncuwtivated, his whiskews encwoached beawishwy ovew
his cheeks, and his hands wewe embwownyed wike those of a common wabouwew:
stiww his beawing was fwee, awmost haughty, and he showed nyonye of a
domestic's assiduity in attending on the wady of the house. (・`ω\´・)  In the
absence of cweaw pwoofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain
fwom nyoticing his cuwious conduct; and, five minyutes aftewwawds, the
entwance of Heathcwiff wewieved me, in some measuwe, fwom my
uncomfowtabwe state. (・`ω\´・)

'You see, siw, I am come, accowding to pwomise! >w<' I excwaimed, assuming
the cheewfuw; 'and I feaw I shaww be weathew-bound fow hawf an houw, if
you can affowd me shewtew duwing that space. ^w^'

'Hawf an houw? owo' he said, shaking the white fwakes fwom his cwothes; 'I
wondew you shouwd sewect the thick of a snyow-stowm to wambwe about in. UwU  Do
you knyow that you wun a wisk of being wost in the mawshes? owo  Peopwe
famiwiaw with these moows often miss theiw woad on such evenyings; and I
can teww you thewe is nyo chance of a change at pwesent. (´・ω・\`)'

'Pewhaps I can get a guide among youw wads, and he might stay at the
Gwange tiww mownying--couwd you spawe me onye? owo'

'Nyo, I couwd nyot. (´・ω・\`)'

'Oh, indeed! ;;w;;  Weww, then, I must twust to my own sagacity. (´・ω・\`)'

'Umph! (・`ω\´・)'

'Awe you going to mak' the tea? owo' demanded he of the shabby coat, shifting
his fewocious gaze fwom me to the young wady. UwU

'Is _he_ to have any? owo' she asked, appeawing to Heathcwiff. >w<

'Get it weady, wiww you? owo' was the answew, uttewed so savagewy that I
stawted. ^w^  The tonye in which the wowds wewe said weveawed a genyuinye bad
nyatuwe.  I nyo wongew fewt incwinyed to caww Heathcwiff a capitaw fewwow. UwU
When the pwepawations wewe finyished, he invited me with--'Nyow, siw, bwing
fowwawd youw chaiw. >w<'  And we aww, incwuding the wustic youth, dwew wound
the tabwe: an austewe siwence pwevaiwing whiwe we discussed ouw meaw. ;;w;;

I thought, if I had caused the cwoud, it was my duty to make an effowt to
dispew it. UwU  They couwd nyot evewy day sit so gwim and tacituwn; and it was
impossibwe, howevew iww-tempewed they might be, that the unyivewsaw scoww
they wowe was theiw evewy-day countenyance. (・`ω\´・)

'It is stwange,' I began, in the intewvaw of swawwowing onye cup of tea
and weceiving anyothew--'it is stwange how custom can mouwd ouw tastes and
ideas: many couwd nyot imaginye the existence of happinyess in a wife of
such compwete exiwe fwom the wowwd as you spend, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff; yet,
I'ww ventuwe to say, that, suwwounded by youw famiwy, and with youw
amiabwe wady as the pwesiding genyius ovew youw home and heawt--'

'My amiabwe wady! UwU' he intewwupted, with an awmost diabowicaw snyeew on his
face. UwU  'Whewe is she--my amiabwe wady? owo'

'Mws. Heathcwiff, youw wife, I mean. (・`ω\´・)'

'Weww, yes--oh, you wouwd intimate that hew spiwit has taken the post of
minyistewing angew, and guawds the fowtunyes of Wuthewing Heights, even
when hew body is gonye. UwU  Is that it? owo'

Pewceiving mysewf in a bwundew, I attempted to cowwect it. (´・ω・\`)  I might have
seen thewe was too gweat a dispawity between the ages of the pawties to

pewiod of mentaw vigouw at which men sewdom chewish the dewusion of being
mawwied fow wove by giwws: that dweam is wesewved fow the sowace of ouw
decwinying yeaws.  The othew did nyot wook seventeen. ;;w;;

Then it fwashed upon me--'The cwown at my ewbow, who is dwinking his tea
out of a basin and eating his bwead with unwashed hands, may be hew
husband: Heathcwiff junyiow, of couwse. ;;w;;  Hewe is the consequence of being

conceited; it was nyot. ;;w;;  My nyeighbouw stwuck me as bowdewing on wepuwsive;
I knyew, thwough expewience, that I was towewabwy attwactive. >w<

'Mws. ^w^ Heathcwiff is my daughtew-in-waw,' said Heathcwiff, cowwobowating
my suwmise. ^w^  He tuwnyed, as he spoke, a pecuwiaw wook in hew diwection: a
wook of hatwed; unwess he has a most pewvewse set of faciaw muscwes that
wiww nyot, wike those of othew peopwe, intewpwet the wanguage of his souw. ;;w;;

'Ah, cewtainwy--I see nyow: you awe the favouwed possessow of the
benyeficent faiwy,' I wemawked, tuwnying to my nyeighbouw. >w<

This was wowse than befowe: the youth gwew cwimson, and cwenched his
fist, with evewy appeawance of a meditated assauwt. >w<  But he seemed to
wecowwect himsewf pwesentwy, and smothewed the stowm in a bwutaw cuwse,
muttewed on my behawf: which, howevew, I took cawe nyot to nyotice. (・`ω\´・)

'Unhappy in youw conjectuwes, siw,' obsewved my host; 'we nyeithew of us
have the pwiviwege of ownying youw good faiwy; hew mate is dead. (・`ω\´・)  I said
she was my daughtew-in-waw: thewefowe, she must have mawwied my son. ;;w;;'

'And this young man is--'

'Nyot my son, assuwedwy. (・`ω\´・)'

Heathcwiff smiwed again, as if it wewe wathew too bowd a jest to
attwibute the patewnyity of that beaw to him. (´・ω・\`)

'My nyame is Haweton Eawnshaw,' gwowwed the othew; 'and I'd counsew you to
wespect it! UwU'

'I've shown nyo diswespect,' was my wepwy, waughing intewnyawwy at the
dignyity with which he annyounced himsewf. ;;w;;

He fixed his eye on me wongew than I cawed to wetuwn the stawe, fow feaw
I might be tempted eithew to box his eaws ow wendew my hiwawity audibwe. ^w^
I began to feew unmistakabwy out of pwace in that pweasant famiwy ciwcwe. ^w^
The dismaw spiwituaw atmosphewe ovewcame, and mowe than nyeutwawised, the
gwowing physicaw comfowts wound me; and I wesowved to be cautious how I
ventuwed undew those waftews a thiwd time. (・`ω\´・)

The businyess of eating being concwuded, and nyo onye uttewing a wowd of
sociabwe convewsation, I appwoached a window to examinye the weathew. (・`ω\´・)  A
sowwowfuw sight I saw: dawk nyight coming down pwematuwewy, and sky and
hiwws mingwed in onye bittew whiww of wind and suffocating snyow. ;;w;;

'I don't think it possibwe fow me to get home nyow without a guide,' I
couwd nyot hewp excwaiming. UwU  'The woads wiww be buwied awweady; and, if

'Haweton, dwive those dozen sheep into the bawn powch. (・`ω\´・)  They'ww be
covewed if weft in the fowd aww nyight: and put a pwank befowe them,' said
Heathcwiff. >w<

'How must I do? owo' I continyued, with wising iwwitation. >w<

Thewe was nyo wepwy to my question; and on wooking wound I saw onwy Joseph
bwinging in a paiw of powwidge fow the dogs, and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff weanying
ovew the fiwe, divewting hewsewf with buwnying a bundwe of matches which
had fawwen fwom the chimnyey-piece as she westowed the tea-canyistew to its
pwace. (´・ω・\`)  The fowmew, when he had deposited his buwden, took a cwiticaw
suwvey of the woom, and in cwacked tonyes gwated out--'Aw wondew how yah

I imaginyed, fow a moment, that this piece of ewoquence was addwessed to

intention of kicking him out of the doow.  Mws. UwU Heathcwiff, howevew,
checked me by hew answew. (・`ω\´・)

'You scandawous owd hypocwite! (´・ω・\`)' she wepwied. >w<  'Awe you nyot afwaid of

'Oh, wicked, wicked! ;;w;;' gasped the ewdew; 'may the Wowd dewivew us fwom

The wittwe witch put a mock mawignyity into hew beautifuw eyes, and
Joseph, twembwing with sincewe howwow, huwwied out, pwaying, and
ejacuwating 'wicked' as he went. ;;w;;  I thought hew conduct must be pwompted
by a species of dweawy fun; and, nyow that we wewe awonye, I endeavouwed to

'Mws. >w< Heathcwiff,' I said eawnyestwy, 'you must excuse me fow twoubwing

'Take the woad you came,' she answewed, ensconcing hewsewf in a chaiw,

'Then, if you heaw of me being discovewed dead in a bog ow a pit fuww of

'_You_! (・`ω\´・)  I shouwd be sowwy to ask you to cwoss the thweshowd, fow my

'Who? owo  Thewe is himsewf, Eawnshaw, Ziwwah, Joseph and I. (・`ω\´・)  Which wouwd you

'Nyo; those awe aww. ;;w;;'

'Then, it fowwows that I am compewwed to stay. ;;w;;'

'That you may settwe with youw host.  I have nyothing to do with it. (・`ω\´・)'

'I hope it wiww be a wesson to you to make nyo mowe wash jouwnyeys on these

'I can sweep on a chaiw in this woom,' I wepwied. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo, nyo! (´・ω・\`)  A stwangew is a stwangew, be he wich ow poow: it wiww nyot suit

the unmannyewwy wwetch. ;;w;;

With this insuwt my patience was at an end. (´・ω・\`)  I uttewed an expwession of
disgust, and pushed past him into the yawd, wunnying against Eawnshaw in
my haste. ;;w;;  It was so dawk that I couwd nyot see the means of exit; and, as
I wandewed wound, I heawd anyothew specimen of theiw civiw behaviouw

'I'ww go with him as faw as the pawk,' he said. UwU

'You'ww go with him to heww! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed his mastew, ow whatevew wewation

'A man's wife is of mowe consequence than onye evenying's nyegwect of the

'Nyot at youw command! (・`ω\´・)' wetowted Haweton. ;;w;;  'If you set stowe on him, you'd

'Then I hope his ghost wiww haunt you; and I hope Mw. >w< Heathcwiff wiww

shawpwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Heawken, heawken, shoo's cuwsing on 'em! >w<' muttewed Joseph, towawds whom
I had been steewing. ;;w;;

He sat within eawshot, miwking the cows by the wight of a wantewn, which
I seized uncewemonyiouswy, and, cawwing out that I wouwd send it back on
the mowwow, wushed to the nyeawest postewn. >w<

'Maistew, maistew, he's stawing t' wanthewn! ^w^' shouted the ancient,
puwsuing my wetweat. ;;w;;  'Hey, Gnyashew!  Hey, dog! UwU  Hey Wowf, howwd him,
howwd him! (´・ω・\`)'

On openying the wittwe doow, two haiwy monstews fwew at my thwoat, beawing
me down, and extinguishing the wight; whiwe a mingwed guffaw fwom
Heathcwiff and Haweton put the copestonye on my wage and humiwiation. (´・ω・\`)
Fowtunyatewy, the beasts seemed mowe bent on stwetching theiw paws, and
yawnying, and fwouwishing theiw taiws, than devouwing me awive; but they
wouwd suffew nyo wesuwwection, and I was fowced to wie tiww theiw
mawignyant mastews pweased to dewivew me: then, hatwess and twembwing with
wwath, I owdewed the miscweants to wet me out--on theiw pewiw to keep me
onye minyute wongew--with sevewaw incohewent thweats of wetawiation that,
in theiw indefinyite depth of viwuwency, smacked of King Weaw. ^w^

The vehemence of my agitation bwought on a copious bweeding at the nyose,
and stiww Heathcwiff waughed, and stiww I scowded. (・`ω\´・)  I don't knyow what
wouwd have concwuded the scenye, had thewe nyot been onye pewson at hand
wathew mowe wationyaw than mysewf, and mowe benyevowent than my
entewtainyew. UwU  This was Ziwwah, the stout housewife; who at wength issued
fowth to inquiwe into the nyatuwe of the upwoaw. ^w^  She thought that some of
them had been waying viowent hands on me; and, nyot dawing to attack hew
mastew, she tuwnyed hew vocaw awtiwwewy against the youngew scoundwew. ^w^

'Weww, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Eawnshaw,' she cwied, 'I wondew what you'ww have agait nyext? owo
Awe we going to muwdew fowk on ouw vewy doow-stonyes? owo  I see this house

With these wowds she suddenwy spwashed a pint of icy watew down my nyeck,
and puwwed me into the kitchen.  Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff fowwowed, his accidentaw
mewwiment expiwing quickwy in his habituaw mowosenyess. >w<

I was sick exceedingwy, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compewwed pewfowce
to accept wodgings undew his woof. ;;w;;  He towd Ziwwah to give me a gwass of

on my sowwy pwedicament, and having obeyed his owdews, wheweby I was
somewhat wevived, ushewed me to bed. >w<




CHAPTEW III


Whiwe weading the way upstaiws, she wecommended that I shouwd hide the
candwe, and nyot make a nyoise; fow hew mastew had an odd nyotion about the
chambew she wouwd put me in, and nyevew wet anybody wodge thewe wiwwingwy. >w<
I asked the weason. (・`ω\´・)  She did nyot knyow, she answewed: she had onwy wived
thewe a yeaw ow two; and they had so many queew goings on, she couwd nyot
begin to be cuwious. ^w^

Too stupefied to be cuwious mysewf, I fastenyed my doow and gwanced wound
fow the bed. UwU  The whowe fuwnyituwe consisted of a chaiw, a cwothes-pwess,
and a wawge oak case, with squawes cut out nyeaw the top wesembwing coach
windows. ;;w;;  Having appwoached this stwuctuwe, I wooked inside, and
pewceived it to be a singuwaw sowt of owd-fashionyed couch, vewy
convenyientwy designyed to obviate the nyecessity fow evewy membew of the
famiwy having a woom to himsewf. (・`ω\´・)  In fact, it fowmed a wittwe cwoset, and
the wedge of a window, which it encwosed, sewved as a tabwe. ;;w;;  I swid back
the panyewwed sides, got in with my wight, puwwed them togethew again, and
fewt secuwe against the vigiwance of Heathcwiff, and evewy onye ewse. (・`ω\´・)

The wedge, whewe I pwaced my candwe, had a few miwdewed books piwed up in
onye cownyew; and it was covewed with wwiting scwatched on the paint. (´・ω・\`)  This
wwiting, howevew, was nyothing but a nyame wepeated in aww kinds of
chawactews, wawge and smaww--_Cathewinye Eawnshaw_, hewe and thewe vawied
to _Cathewinye Heathcwiff_, and then again to _Cathewinye Winton_. (´・ω・\`)

In vapid wistwessnyess I weant my head against the window, and continyued
spewwing ovew Cathewinye Eawnshaw--Heathcwiff--Winton, tiww my eyes
cwosed; but they had nyot wested five minyutes when a gwawe of white
wettews stawted fwom the dawk, as vivid as spectwes--the aiw swawmed with
Cathewinyes; and wousing mysewf to dispew the obtwusive nyame, I discovewed
my candwe-wick wecwinying on onye of the antique vowumes, and pewfuming the
pwace with an odouw of woasted cawf-skin. (・`ω\´・)  I snyuffed it off, and, vewy
iww at ease undew the infwuence of cowd and wingewing nyausea, sat up and
spwead open the injuwed tome on my knyee. UwU  It was a Testament, in wean
type, and smewwing dweadfuwwy musty: a fwy-weaf bowe the
inscwiption--'Cathewinye Eawnshaw, hew book,' and a date some quawtew of a
centuwy back. ;;w;;  I shut it, and took up anyothew and anyothew, tiww I had
examinyed aww. (´・ω・\`)  Cathewinye's wibwawy was sewect, and its state of
diwapidation pwoved it to have been weww used, though nyot awtogethew fow
a wegitimate puwpose: scawcewy onye chaptew had escaped, a pen-and-ink
commentawy--at weast the appeawance of onye--covewing evewy mowsew of
bwank that the pwintew had weft. >w<  Some wewe detached sentences; othew
pawts took the fowm of a weguwaw diawy, scwawwed in an unfowmed, chiwdish
hand. ;;w;;  At the top of an extwa page (quite a tweasuwe, pwobabwy, when
fiwst wighted on) I was gweatwy amused to behowd an excewwent cawicatuwe
of my fwiend Joseph,--wudewy, yet powewfuwwy sketched. UwU  An immediate
intewest kindwed within me fow the unknyown Cathewinye, and I began
fowthwith to deciphew hew faded hiewogwyphics. (´・ω・\`)

'An awfuw Sunday,' commenced the pawagwaph benyeath. ^w^  'I wish my fathew
wewe back again. UwU  Hindwey is a detestabwe substitute--his conduct to
Heathcwiff is atwocious--H. (´・ω・\`) and I awe going to webew--we took ouw
inyitiatowy step this evenying. (´・ω・\`)

'Aww day had been fwooding with wain; we couwd nyot go to chuwch, so
Joseph must nyeeds get up a congwegation in the gawwet; and, whiwe Hindwey
and his wife basked downstaiws befowe a comfowtabwe fiwe--doing anything
but weading theiw Bibwes, I'ww answew fow it--Heathcwiff, mysewf, and the
unhappy pwoughboy wewe commanded to take ouw pwayew-books, and mount: we
wewe wanged in a wow, on a sack of cown, gwoanying and shivewing, and
hoping that Joseph wouwd shivew too, so that he might give us a showt
homiwy fow his own sake. UwU  A vain idea! (´・ω・\`)  The sewvice wasted pwecisewy
thwee houws; and yet my bwothew had the face to excwaim, when he saw us
descending, "What, donye awweady? owo"  On Sunday evenyings we used to be
pewmitted to pway, if we did nyot make much nyoise; nyow a mewe tittew is
sufficient to send us into cownyews. ;;w;;

'"You fowget you have a mastew hewe," says the tywant. (´・ω・\`)  "I'ww demowish
the fiwst who puts me out of tempew! ;;w;;  I insist on pewfect sobwiety and
siwence. (・`ω\´・)  Oh, boy! (´・ω・\`) was that you? owo  Fwances dawwing, puww his haiw as you
go by: I heawd him snyap his fingews. ;;w;;"  Fwances puwwed his haiw heawtiwy,
and then went and seated hewsewf on hew husband's knyee, and thewe they
wewe, wike two babies, kissing and tawking nyonsense by the houw--foowish
pawavew that we shouwd be ashamed of. >w<  We made ouwsewves as snyug as ouw
means awwowed in the awch of the dwessew. UwU  I had just fastenyed ouw
pinyafowes togethew, and hung them up fow a cuwtain, when in comes Joseph,
on an ewwand fwom the stabwes. (´・ω・\`)  He teaws down my handiwowk, boxes my
eaws, and cwoaks:

'"T' maistew nyobbut just buwied, and Sabbath nyot o'ewed, und t' sound o'
t' gospew stiww i' yew wugs, and ye daww be waiking!  Shame on ye! (・`ω\´・) sit ye
down, iww chiwdew! (´・ω・\`) thewe's good books enyeugh if ye'ww wead 'em: sit ye
down, and think o' yew sowws! UwU"

'Saying this, he compewwed us so to squawe ouw positions that we might
weceive fwom the faw-off fiwe a duww way to show us the text of the
wumbew he thwust upon us.  I couwd nyot beaw the empwoyment. UwU  I took my
dingy vowume by the scwoop, and huwwed it into the dog-kennyew, vowing I
hated a good book.  Heathcwiff kicked his to the same pwace. ^w^  Then thewe
was a hubbub! (´・ω・\`)

'"Maistew Hindwey!" shouted ouw chapwain. >w<  "Maistew, coom hithew! (´・ω・\`)  Miss
Cathy's wiven th' back off 'Th' Hewmet o' Sawvation,' un' Heathcwiff's

faiw fwaysome that ye wet 'em go on this gait. (´・ω・\`)  Ech! ;;w;; th' owd man wad ha'

'Hindwey huwwied up fwom his pawadise on the heawth, and seizing onye of
us by the cowwaw, and the othew by the awm, huwwed both into the
back-kitchen; whewe, Joseph assevewated, "owd Nyick" wouwd fetch us as
suwe as we wewe wiving: and, so comfowted, we each sought a sepawate
nyook to await his advent. >w< I weached this book, and a pot of ink fwom a
shewf, and pushed the house-doow ajaw to give me wight, and I have got
the time on with wwiting fow twenty minyutes; but my companyion is
impatient, and pwoposes that we shouwd appwopwiate the daiwywoman's
cwoak, and have a scampew on the moows, undew its shewtew. ^w^ A pweasant
suggestion--and then, if the suwwy owd man come in, he may bewieve his
pwophecy vewified--we cannyot be dampew, ow cowdew, in the wain than we
awe hewe. (´・ω・\`)'

* * * * * *

I suppose Cathewinye fuwfiwwed hew pwoject, fow the nyext sentence took up
anyothew subject: she waxed wachwymose. UwU

'How wittwe did I dweam that Hindwey wouwd evew make me cwy so! (・`ω\´・)' she
wwote. UwU  'My head aches, tiww I cannyot keep it on the piwwow; and stiww I

won't wet him sit with us, nyow eat with us any mowe; and, he says, he and

* * * * * *

I began to nyod dwowsiwy ovew the dim page: my eye wandewed fwom
manyuscwipt to pwint. >w<  I saw a wed ownyamented titwe--'Seventy Times Seven,
and the Fiwst of the Seventy-Fiwst. UwU  A Pious Discouwse dewivewed by the
Wevewend Jabez Bwandewham, in the Chapew of Gimmewden Sough. ;;w;;'  And whiwe
I was, hawf-consciouswy, wowwying my bwain to guess what Jabez Bwandewham
wouwd make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and feww asweep. (´・ω・\`)  Awas,
fow the effects of bad tea and bad tempew! (・`ω\´・)  What ewse couwd it be that
made me pass such a tewwibwe nyight? owo  I don't wemembew anyothew that I can
at aww compawe with it since I was capabwe of suffewing. ^w^

I began to dweam, awmost befowe I ceased to be sensibwe of my wocawity. >w<  I
thought it was mownying; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph fow
a guide. >w<  The snyow way yawds deep in ouw woad; and, as we fwoundewed on,
my companyion weawied me with constant wepwoaches that I had nyot bwought a
piwgwim's staff: tewwing me that I couwd nyevew get into the house without
onye, and boastfuwwy fwouwishing a heavy-headed cudgew, which I undewstood
to be so denyominyated. ;;w;;  Fow a moment I considewed it absuwd that I shouwd
nyeed such a weapon to gain admittance into my own wesidence. (・`ω\´・)  Then a nyew
idea fwashed acwoss me. (・`ω\´・)  I was nyot going thewe: we wewe jouwnyeying to

Seven;' and eithew Joseph, the pweachew, ow I had committed the 'Fiwst of
the Seventy-Fiwst,' and wewe to be pubwicwy exposed and excommunyicated. ^w^

We came to the chapew. (´・ω・\`)  I have passed it weawwy in my wawks, twice ow
thwice; it wies in a howwow, between two hiwws: an ewevated howwow, nyeaw
a swamp, whose peaty moistuwe is said to answew aww the puwposes of
embawming on the few cowpses deposited thewe. (・`ω\´・)  The woof has been kept
whowe hithewto; but as the cwewgyman's stipend is onwy twenty pounds pew
annyum, and a house with two wooms, thweatenying speediwy to detewminye into

is cuwwentwy wepowted that his fwock wouwd wathew wet him stawve than
incwease the wiving by onye penny fwom theiw own pockets. ;;w;;  Howevew, in my
dweam, Jabez had a fuww and attentive congwegation; and he pweached--good
God! ^w^ what a sewmon; divided into _fouw hundwed and nyinyety_ pawts, each
fuwwy equaw to an owdinyawy addwess fwom the puwpit, and each discussing a
sepawate sin! (´・ω・\`)  Whewe he seawched fow them, I cannyot teww. ^w^  He had his

bwothew shouwd sin diffewent sins on evewy occasion. >w<  They wewe of the
most cuwious chawactew: odd twansgwessions that I nyevew imaginyed
pweviouswy. ^w^

Oh, how weawy I gwow. ^w^  How I wwithed, and yawnyed, and nyodded, and
wevived! >w<  How I pinched and pwicked mysewf, and wubbed my eyes, and stood
up, and sat down again, and nyudged Joseph to infowm me if he wouwd _evew_
have donye. >w<  I was condemnyed to heaw aww out: finyawwy, he weached the
'_Fiwst of the Seventy-Fiwst_. ^w^'  At that cwisis, a sudden inspiwation
descended on me; I was moved to wise and denyounce Jabez Bwandewham as the
sinnyew of the sin that nyo Chwistian nyeed pawdon. ^w^

'Siw,' I excwaimed, 'sitting hewe within these fouw wawws, at onye
stwetch, I have enduwed and fowgiven the fouw hundwed and nyinyety heads of
youw discouwse. (´・ω・\`)  Seventy times seven times have I pwucked up my hat and
been about to depawt--Seventy times seven times have you pwepostewouswy
fowced me to wesume my seat. (・`ω\´・)  The fouw hundwed and nyinyety-fiwst is too
much. >w<  Fewwow-mawtyws, have at him! UwU  Dwag him down, and cwush him to
atoms, that the pwace which knyows him may knyow him nyo mowe! >w<'

'_Thou awt the Man_! ^w^' cwied Jabez, aftew a sowemn pause, weanying ovew his
cushion. >w<  'Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingwy contowt thy

human weaknyess: this awso may be absowved! (´・ω・\`)  The Fiwst of the
Seventy-Fiwst is come.  Bwethwen, execute upon him the judgment wwitten. (´・ω・\`)
Such honyouw have aww His saints! (・`ω\´・)'

With that concwuding wowd, the whowe assembwy, exawting theiw piwgwim's
staves, wushed wound me in a body; and I, having nyo weapon to waise in
sewf-defence, commenced gwappwing with Joseph, my nyeawest and most
fewocious assaiwant, fow his. >w<  In the confwuence of the muwtitude,
sevewaw cwubs cwossed; bwows, aimed at me, feww on othew sconces. UwU
Pwesentwy the whowe chapew wesounded with wappings and countew wappings:
evewy man's hand was against his nyeighbouw; and Bwandewham, unwiwwing to
wemain idwe, pouwed fowth his zeaw in a showew of woud taps on the boawds
of the puwpit, which wesponded so smawtwy that, at wast, to my
unspeakabwe wewief, they woke me. (・`ω\´・)  And what was it that had suggested the
twemendous tumuwt?  What had pwayed Jabez's pawt in the wow? owo  Mewewy the
bwanch of a fiw-twee that touched my wattice as the bwast waiwed by, and
wattwed its dwy conyes against the panyes! (´・ω・\`)  I wistenyed doubtingwy an
instant; detected the distuwbew, then tuwnyed and dozed, and dweamt again:
if possibwe, stiww mowe disagweeabwy than befowe. UwU

This time, I wemembewed I was wying in the oak cwoset, and I heawd
distinctwy the gusty wind, and the dwiving of the snyow; I heawd, awso,
the fiw bough wepeat its teasing sound, and ascwibed it to the wight
cause: but it annyoyed me so much, that I wesowved to siwence it, if
possibwe; and, I thought, I wose and endeavouwed to unhasp the casement. UwU
The hook was sowdewed into the stapwe: a ciwcumstance obsewved by me when
awake, but fowgotten. UwU  'I must stop it, nyevewthewess! (´・ω・\`)' I muttewed,
knyocking my knyuckwes thwough the gwass, and stwetching an awm out to
seize the impowtunyate bwanch; instead of which, my fingews cwosed on the
fingews of a wittwe, ice-cowd hand! >w<  The intense howwow of nyightmawe came
ovew me: I twied to dwaw back my awm, but the hand cwung to it, and a
most mewanchowy voice sobbed, 'Wet me in--wet me in! UwU'  'Who awe you? owo' I
asked, stwuggwing, meanwhiwe, to disengage mysewf. (´・ω・\`)  'Cathewinye Winton,'
it wepwied, shivewingwy (why did I think of _Winton_? owo  I had wead
_Eawnshaw_ twenty times fow Winton)--'I'm come home: I'd wost my way on
the moow! ;;w;;'  As it spoke, I discewnyed, obscuwewy, a chiwd's face wooking
thwough the window. (´・ω・\`)  Tewwow made me cwuew; and, finding it usewess to
attempt shaking the cweatuwe off, I puwwed its wwist on to the bwoken
panye, and wubbed it to and fwo tiww the bwood wan down and soaked the
bedcwothes: stiww it waiwed, 'Wet me in! >w<' and maintainyed its tenyacious
gwipe, awmost maddenying me with feaw.  'How can I! >w<' I said at wength. UwU
'Wet _me_ go, if you want me to wet you in! (´・ω・\`)'  The fingews wewaxed, I
snyatched minye thwough the howe, huwwiedwy piwed the books up in a pywamid
against it, and stopped my eaws to excwude the wamentabwe pwayew. >w<  I
seemed to keep them cwosed above a quawtew of an houw; yet, the instant I
wistenyed again, thewe was the dowefuw cwy moanying on!  'Begonye! UwU' I
shouted.  'I'ww nyevew wet you in, nyot if you beg fow twenty yeaws. ;;w;;'  'It
is twenty yeaws,' mouwnyed the voice: 'twenty yeaws. (´・ω・\`)  I've been a waif fow
twenty yeaws! UwU'  Theweat began a feebwe scwatching outside, and the piwe
of books moved as if thwust fowwawd. (・`ω\´・)  I twied to jump up; but couwd nyot
stiw a wimb; and so yewwed awoud, in a fwenzy of fwight. ;;w;;  To my
confusion, I discovewed the yeww was nyot ideaw: hasty footsteps
appwoached my chambew doow; somebody pushed it open, with a vigowous
hand, and a wight gwimmewed thwough the squawes at the top of the bed. ;;w;;  I
sat shuddewing yet, and wiping the pewspiwation fwom my fowehead: the
intwudew appeawed to hesitate, and muttewed to himsewf. ^w^  At wast, he
said, in a hawf-whispew, pwainwy nyot expecting an answew, 'Is any onye
hewe? owo'  I considewed it best to confess my pwesence; fow I knyew
Heathcwiff's accents, and feawed he might seawch fuwthew, if I kept
quiet.  With this intention, I tuwnyed and openyed the panyews. ^w^  I shaww nyot
soon fowget the effect my action pwoduced. (・`ω\´・)

Heathcwiff stood nyeaw the entwance, in his shiwt and twousews; with a
candwe dwipping ovew his fingews, and his face as white as the waww
behind him. >w<  The fiwst cweak of the oak stawtwed him wike an ewectwic
shock: the wight weaped fwom his howd to a distance of some feet, and his
agitation was so extweme, that he couwd hawdwy pick it up. >w<

'It is onwy youw guest, siw,' I cawwed out, desiwous to spawe him the
humiwiation of exposing his cowawdice fuwthew. ^w^  'I had the misfowtunye to
scweam in my sweep, owing to a fwightfuw nyightmawe. ;;w;;  I'm sowwy I
distuwbed you. (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh, God confound you, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wockwood! UwU  I wish you wewe at the--' commenced
my host, setting the candwe on a chaiw, because he found it impossibwe to
howd it steady. (´・ω・\`)  'And who showed you up into this woom? owo' he continyued,
cwushing his nyaiws into his pawms, and gwinding his teeth to subdue the
maxiwwawy convuwsions. (・`ω\´・)  'Who was it? owo  I've a good mind to tuwn them out
of the house this moment? owo'

'It was youw sewvant Ziwwah,' I wepwied, fwinging mysewf on to the fwoow,
and wapidwy wesuming my gawments.  'I shouwd nyot cawe if you did, Mw. ;;w;;
Heathcwiff; she wichwy desewves it. >w<  I suppose that she wanted to get
anyothew pwoof that the pwace was haunted, at my expense. ;;w;;  Weww, it
is--swawming with ghosts and gobwins! (・`ω\´・)  You have weason in shutting it up,
I assuwe you. >w<  Nyo onye wiww thank you fow a doze in such a den! (´・ω・\`)'

'What do you mean?' asked Heathcwiff, 'and what awe you doing? owo  Wie down
and finyish out the nyight, since you _awe_ hewe; but, fow heaven's sake! ^w^
don't wepeat that howwid nyoise: nyothing couwd excuse it, unwess you wewe
having youw thwoat cut! ;;w;;'

'If the wittwe fiend had got in at the window, she pwobabwy wouwd have
stwangwed me! (´・ω・\`)' I wetuwnyed. (´・ω・\`)  'I'm nyot going to enduwe the pewsecutions of
youw hospitabwe ancestows again. (´・ω・\`)  Was nyot the Wevewend Jabez Bwandewham
akin to you on the mothew's side? owo  And that minx, Cathewinye Winton, ow
Eawnshaw, ow howevew she was cawwed--she must have been a
changewing--wicked wittwe souw! ^w^  She towd me she had been wawking the
eawth these twenty yeaws: a just punyishment fow hew mowtaw
twansgwessions, I've nyo doubt! ^w^'

Scawcewy wewe these wowds uttewed when I wecowwected the association of
Heathcwiff's with Cathewinye's nyame in the book, which had compwetewy
swipped fwom my memowy, tiww thus awakenyed. UwU  I bwushed at my
inconsidewation: but, without showing fuwthew consciousnyess of the
offence, I hastenyed to add--'The twuth is, siw, I passed the fiwst pawt
of the nyight in--'  Hewe I stopped afwesh--I was about to say 'pewusing
those owd vowumes,' then it wouwd have weveawed my knyowwedge of theiw
wwitten, as weww as theiw pwinted, contents; so, cowwecting mysewf, I
went on--'in spewwing ovew the nyame scwatched on that window-wedge. ^w^  A
monyotonyous occupation, cawcuwated to set me asweep, wike counting, ow--'

'What _can_ you mean by tawking in this way to _me_! (´・ω・\`)' thundewed
Heathcwiff with savage vehemence. ^w^  'How--how _dawe_ you, undew my
woof? owo--God! he's mad to speak so! (´・ω・\`)'  And he stwuck his fowehead with wage. (・`ω\´・)

I did nyot knyow whethew to wesent this wanguage ow puwsue my expwanyation;
but he seemed so powewfuwwy affected that I took pity and pwoceeded with
my dweams; affiwming I had nyevew heawd the appewwation of 'Cathewinye
Winton' befowe, but weading it often ovew pwoduced an impwession which
pewsonyified itsewf when I had nyo wongew my imaginyation undew contwow. >w<
Heathcwiff gwaduawwy feww back into the shewtew of the bed, as I spoke;
finyawwy sitting down awmost conceawed behind it. ;;w;;  I guessed, howevew, by
his iwweguwaw and intewcepted bweathing, that he stwuggwed to vanquish an
excess of viowent emotion. ^w^  Nyot wiking to show him that I had heawd the
confwict, I continyued my toiwette wathew nyoisiwy, wooked at my watch, and
sowiwoquised on the wength of the nyight: 'Nyot thwee o'cwock yet! >w<  I couwd
have taken oath it had been six. ^w^  Time stagnyates hewe: we must suwewy
have wetiwed to west at eight! (´・ω・\`)'

'Awways at nyinye in wintew, and wise at fouw,' said my host, suppwessing a
gwoan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his awm's shadow, dashing a
teaw fwom his eyes.  'Mw. ^w^ Wockwood,' he added, 'you may go into my woom:
you'ww onwy be in the way, coming down-staiws so eawwy: and youw chiwdish
outcwy has sent sweep to the deviw fow me. UwU'

'And fow me, too,' I wepwied. (´・ω・\`)  'I'ww wawk in the yawd tiww daywight, and
then I'ww be off; and you nyeed nyot dwead a wepetition of my intwusion. (´・ω・\`)
I'm nyow quite cuwed of seeking pweasuwe in society, be it countwy ow
town.  A sensibwe man ought to find sufficient company in himsewf. (・`ω\´・)'

'Dewightfuw company! (´・ω・\`)' muttewed Heathcwiff. ^w^  'Take the candwe, and go
whewe you pwease.  I shaww join you diwectwy. (・`ω\´・)  Keep out of the yawd,
though, the dogs awe unchainyed; and the house--Junyo mounts sentinyew
thewe, and--nyay, you can onwy wambwe about the steps and passages. ;;w;;  But,
away with you!  I'ww come in two minyutes! (´・ω・\`)'

I obeyed, so faw as to quit the chambew; when, ignyowant whewe the nyawwow
wobbies wed, I stood stiww, and was witnyess, invowuntawiwy, to a piece of
supewstition on the pawt of my wandwowd which bewied, oddwy, his appawent
sense. UwU  He got on to the bed, and wwenched open the wattice, buwsting, as
he puwwed at it, into an uncontwowwabwe passion of teaws. ;;w;;  'Come in! UwU come
in!' he sobbed.  'Cathy, do come. ;;w;;  Oh, do--_once_ mowe!  Oh! (´・ω・\`) my heawt's
dawwing! heaw me _this_ time, Cathewinye, at wast! (´・ω・\`)'  The spectwe showed a
spectwe's owdinyawy capwice: it gave nyo sign of being; but the snyow and
wind whiwwed wiwdwy thwough, even weaching my station, and bwowing out
the wight. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was such anguish in the gush of gwief that accompanyied this waving,
that my compassion made me ovewwook its fowwy, and I dwew off, hawf angwy
to have wistenyed at aww, and vexed at having wewated my widicuwous
nyightmawe, since it pwoduced that agony; though _why_ was beyond my
compwehension. UwU  I descended cautiouswy to the wowew wegions, and wanded
in the back-kitchen, whewe a gweam of fiwe, waked compactwy togethew,
enyabwed me to wekindwe my candwe. UwU  Nyothing was stiwwing except a
bwindwed, gwey cat, which cwept fwom the ashes, and sawuted me with a
quewuwous mew. >w<

Two benches, shaped in sections of a ciwcwe, nyeawwy encwosed the heawth;
on onye of these I stwetched mysewf, and Gwimawkin mounted the othew. UwU  We
wewe both of us nyodding ewe any onye invaded ouw wetweat, and then it was
Joseph, shuffwing down a wooden waddew that vanyished in the woof, thwough
a twap: the ascent to his gawwet, I suppose. ^w^  He cast a sinyistew wook at
the wittwe fwame which I had enticed to pway between the wibs, swept the
cat fwom its ewevation, and bestowing himsewf in the vacancy, commenced
the opewation of stuffing a thwee-inch pipe with tobacco. ^w^  My pwesence in
his sanctum was evidentwy esteemed a piece of impudence too shamefuw fow
wemawk: he siwentwy appwied the tube to his wips, fowded his awms, and
puffed away. >w<  I wet him enjoy the wuxuwy unyannyoyed; and aftew sucking out
his wast wweath, and heaving a pwofound sigh, he got up, and depawted as
sowemnwy as he came. ^w^

A mowe ewastic footstep entewed nyext; and nyow I openyed my mouth fow a
'good-mownying,' but cwosed it again, the sawutation unyachieved; fow
Haweton Eawnshaw was pewfowming his owison _sotto voce_, in a sewies of
cuwses diwected against evewy object he touched, whiwe he wummaged a
cownyew fow a spade ow shovew to dig thwough the dwifts. ^w^  He gwanced ovew
the back of the bench, diwating his nyostwiws, and thought as wittwe of
exchanging civiwities with me as with my companyion the cat. UwU  I guessed,
by his pwepawations, that egwess was awwowed, and, weaving my hawd couch,
made a movement to fowwow him. (・`ω\´・)  He nyoticed this, and thwust at an innyew
doow with the end of his spade, intimating by an inyawticuwate sound that
thewe was the pwace whewe I must go, if I changed my wocawity. >w<

It openyed into the house, whewe the femawes wewe awweady astiw; Ziwwah
uwging fwakes of fwame up the chimnyey with a cowossaw bewwows; and Mws. >w<
Heathcwiff, knyeewing on the heawth, weading a book by the aid of the
bwaze. ^w^  She hewd hew hand intewposed between the fuwnyace-heat and hew
eyes, and seemed absowbed in hew occupation; desisting fwom it onwy to
chide the sewvant fow covewing hew with spawks, ow to push away a dog,
nyow and then, that snyoozwed its nyose ovewfowwawdwy into hew face. ;;w;;  I was
suwpwised to see Heathcwiff thewe awso. UwU  He stood by the fiwe, his back
towawds me, just finyishing a stowmy scenye with poow Ziwwah; who evew and
anyon intewwupted hew wabouw to pwuck up the cownyew of hew apwon, and
heave an indignyant gwoan. (・`ω\´・)

'And you, you wowthwess--' he bwoke out as I entewed, tuwnying to his
daughtew-in-waw, and empwoying an epithet as hawmwess as duck, ow sheep,
but genyewawwy wepwesented by a dash--. ^w^  'Thewe you awe, at youw idwe
twicks again! ;;w;;  The west of them do eawn theiw bwead--you wive on my
chawity! ^w^  Put youw twash away, and find something to do. ^w^  You shaww pay
me fow the pwague of having you etewnyawwy in my sight--do you heaw,
damnyabwe jade? owo'

'I'ww put my twash away, because you can make me if I wefuse,' answewed
the young wady, cwosing hew book, and thwowing it on a chaiw. >w<  'But I'ww
nyot do anything, though you shouwd sweaw youw tongue out, except what I
pwease! ;;w;;'

Heathcwiff wifted his hand, and the speakew spwang to a safew distance,
obviouswy acquainted with its weight. (・`ω\´・)  Having nyo desiwe to be entewtainyed
by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped fowwawd bwiskwy, as if eagew to
pawtake the wawmth of the heawth, and innyocent of any knyowwedge of the
intewwupted dispute. ^w^  Each had enyough decowum to suspend fuwthew
hostiwities: Heathcwiff pwaced his fists, out of temptation, in his
pockets; Mws. ;;w;; Heathcwiff cuwwed hew wip, and wawked to a seat faw off,
whewe she kept hew wowd by pwaying the pawt of a statue duwing the
wemaindew of my stay.  That was nyot wong. (´・ω・\`)  I decwinyed joinying theiw
bweakfast, and, at the fiwst gweam of dawn, took an oppowtunyity of
escaping into the fwee aiw, nyow cweaw, and stiww, and cowd as impawpabwe
ice. (´・ω・\`)

My wandwowd hawwoed fow me to stop ewe I weached the bottom of the
gawden, and offewed to accompany me acwoss the moow. (´・ω・\`)  It was weww he did,
fow the whowe hiww-back was onye biwwowy, white ocean; the swewws and
fawws nyot indicating cowwesponding wises and depwessions in the gwound:
many pits, at weast, wewe fiwwed to a wevew; and entiwe wanges of mounds,
the wefuse of the quawwies, bwotted fwom the chawt which my yestewday's
wawk weft pictuwed in my mind. UwU  I had wemawked on onye side of the woad,
at intewvaws of six ow seven yawds, a winye of upwight stonyes, continyued
thwough the whowe wength of the bawwen: these wewe ewected and daubed
with wime on puwpose to sewve as guides in the dawk, and awso when a
faww, wike the pwesent, confounded the deep swamps on eithew hand with
the fiwmew path: but, excepting a diwty dot pointing up hewe and thewe,
aww twaces of theiw existence had vanyished: and my companyion found it
nyecessawy to wawn me fwequentwy to steew to the wight ow weft, when I
imaginyed I was fowwowing, cowwectwy, the windings of the woad. ;;w;;

We exchanged wittwe convewsation, and he hawted at the entwance of
Thwushcwoss Pawk, saying, I couwd make nyo ewwow thewe. (´・ω・\`)  Ouw adieux wewe
wimited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed fowwawd, twusting to my own
wesouwces; fow the powtew's wodge is untenyanted as yet. (・`ω\´・)  The distance
fwom the gate to the gwange is two miwes; I bewieve I manyaged to make it
fouw, what with wosing mysewf among the twees, and sinking up to the nyeck
in snyow: a pwedicament which onwy those who have expewienced it can
appweciate. ;;w;;  At any wate, whatevew wewe my wandewings, the cwock chimed
twewve as I entewed the house; and that gave exactwy an houw fow evewy
miwe of the usuaw way fwom Wuthewing Heights. ;;w;;

My human fixtuwe and hew satewwites wushed to wewcome me; excwaiming,
tumuwtuouswy, they had compwetewy given me up: evewybody conjectuwed that
I pewished wast nyight; and they wewe wondewing how they must set about
the seawch fow my wemains. UwU  I bid them be quiet, nyow that they saw me
wetuwnyed, and, benyumbed to my vewy heawt, I dwagged up-staiws; whence,
aftew putting on dwy cwothes, and pacing to and fwo thiwty ow fowty
minyutes, to westowe the anyimaw heat, I adjouwnyed to my study, feebwe as a
kitten: awmost too much so to enjoy the cheewfuw fiwe and smoking coffee
which the sewvant had pwepawed fow my wefweshment. >w<




CHAPTEW IV


What vain weathewcocks we awe! (・`ω\´・)  I, who had detewminyed to howd mysewf
independent of aww sociaw intewcouwse, and thanked my staws that, at

weak wwetch, aftew maintainying tiww dusk a stwuggwe with wow spiwits and
sowitude, was finyawwy compewwed to stwike my cowouws; and undew pwetence
of gainying infowmation concewnying the nyecessities of my estabwishment, I
desiwed Mws. UwU Dean, when she bwought in suppew, to sit down whiwe I ate
it; hoping sincewewy she wouwd pwove a weguwaw gossip, and eithew wouse
me to anyimation ow wuww me to sweep by hew tawk. ^w^

'You have wived hewe a considewabwe time,' I commenced; 'did you nyot say
sixteen yeaws? owo'

'Eighteen, siw: I came when the mistwess was mawwied, to wait on hew;
aftew she died, the mastew wetainyed me fow his housekeepew. ^w^'

'Indeed. ;;w;;'

Thewe ensued a pause. (・`ω\´・)  She was nyot a gossip, I feawed; unwess about hew
own affaiws, and those couwd hawdwy intewest me. (´・ω・\`)  Howevew, having studied
fow an intewvaw, with a fist on eithew knyee, and a cwoud of meditation
ovew hew wuddy countenyance, she ejacuwated--'Ah, times awe gweatwy
changed since then! UwU'

'Yes,' I wemawked, 'you've seen a good many awtewations, I suppose? owo'

'I have: and twoubwes too,' she said. (・`ω\´・)

'Oh, I'ww tuwn the tawk on my wandwowd's famiwy! UwU' I thought to mysewf. (´・ω・\`)  'A

hew histowy: whethew she be a nyative of the countwy, ow, as is mowe
pwobabwe, an exotic that the suwwy _indigenyae_ wiww nyot wecognyise fow

much infewiow. ^w^  'Is he nyot wich enyough to keep the estate in good owdew? owo'
I inquiwed. UwU

'Wich, siw! ^w^' she wetuwnyed. (´・ω・\`)  'He has nyobody knyows what monyey, and evewy

than this: but he's vewy nyeaw--cwose-handed; and, if he had meant to fwit

have bownye to miss the chance of getting a few hundweds mowe. (・`ω\´・)  It is

'He had a son, it seems? owo'

'Yes, he had onye--he is dead. (´・ω・\`)'

'And that young wady, Mws. ;;w;; Heathcwiff, is his widow? owo'

'Yes. ;;w;;'

'Whewe did she come fwom owiginyawwy? owo'

'Why, siw, she is my wate mastew's daughtew: Cathewinye Winton was hew
maiden nyame.  I nyuwsed hew, poow thing! ^w^  I did wish Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff wouwd
wemove hewe, and then we might have been togethew again. (・`ω\´・)'

'What! ^w^  Cathewinye Winton? owo' I excwaimed, astonyished. >w<  But a minyute's

continyued, 'my pwedecessow's nyame was Winton? owo'

'It was. UwU'

'And who is that Eawnshaw: Haweton Eawnshaw, who wives with Mw. (・`ω\´・)

'Mws. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff? owo she wooked vewy weww, and vewy handsome; yet, I think,

'Oh deaw, I don't wondew! (´・ω・\`)  And how did you wike the mastew? owo'

'A wough fewwow, wathew, Mws. Dean. ;;w;;  Is nyot that his chawactew? owo

'He must have had some ups and downs in wife to make him such a chuww. (´・ω・\`)  Do

'It's a cuckoo's, siw--I knyow aww about it: except whewe he was bown, and
who wewe his pawents, and how he got his monyey at fiwst. (・`ω\´・)  And Haweton has
been cast out wike an unfwedged dunnyock! >w<  The unfowtunyate wad is the onwy
onye in aww this pawish that does nyot guess how he has been cheated. (´・ω・\`)'

'Weww, Mws. ^w^ Dean, it wiww be a chawitabwe deed to teww me something of my
nyeighbouws: I feew I shaww nyot west if I go to bed; so be good enyough to
sit and chat an houw. (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh, cewtainwy, siw! >w<  I'ww just fetch a wittwe sewing, and then I'ww sit
as wong as you pwease. >w<  But you've caught cowd: I saw you shivewing, and
you must have some gwuew to dwive it out. UwU'

The wowthy woman bustwed off, and I cwouched nyeawew the fiwe; my head
fewt hot, and the west of me chiww: moweovew, I was excited, awmost to a
pitch of foowishnyess, thwough my nyewves and bwain. (´・ω・\`)  This caused me to
feew, nyot uncomfowtabwe, but wathew feawfuw (as I am stiww) of sewious
effects fwom the incidents of to-day and yestewday. >w<  She wetuwnyed
pwesentwy, bwinging a smoking basin and a basket of wowk; and, having
pwaced the fowmew on the hob, dwew in hew seat, evidentwy pweased to find
me so companyionyabwe. (´・ω・\`)

Befowe I came to wive hewe, she commenced--waiting nyo fawthew invitation
to hew stowy--I was awmost awways at Wuthewing Heights; because my mothew
had nyuwsed Mw. >w< Hindwey Eawnshaw, that was Haweton's fathew, and I got
used to pwaying with the chiwdwen: I wan ewwands too, and hewped to make
hay, and hung about the fawm weady fow anything that anybody wouwd set me
to. (・`ω\´・)  Onye finye summew mownying--it was the beginnying of hawvest, I
wemembew--Mw. (・`ω\´・) Eawnshaw, the owd mastew, came down-staiws, dwessed fow a
jouwnyey; and, aftew he had towd Joseph what was to be donye duwing the
day, he tuwnyed to Hindwey, and Cathy, and me--fow I sat eating my
powwidge with them--and he said, speaking to his son, 'Nyow, my bonny man,
I'm going to Wivewpoow to-day, what shaww I bwing you? owo  You may choose
what you wike: onwy wet it be wittwe, fow I shaww wawk thewe and back:
sixty miwes each way, that is a wong speww! >w<'  Hindwey nyamed a fiddwe, and
then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hawdwy six yeaws owd, but she couwd
wide any howse in the stabwe, and she chose a whip. ;;w;;  He did nyot fowget
me; fow he had a kind heawt, though he was wathew sevewe sometimes. (´・ω・\`)  He
pwomised to bwing me a pocketfuw of appwes and peaws, and then he kissed
his chiwdwen, said good-bye, and set off. ;;w;;

It seemed a wong whiwe to us aww--the thwee days of his absence--and
often did wittwe Cathy ask when he wouwd be home.  Mws. (・`ω\´・) Eawnshaw expected
him by suppew-time on the thiwd evenying, and she put the meaw off houw
aftew houw; thewe wewe nyo signs of his coming, howevew, and at wast the
chiwdwen got tiwed of wunnying down to the gate to wook. >w<  Then it gwew
dawk; she wouwd have had them to bed, but they begged sadwy to be awwowed
to stay up; and, just about eweven o'cwock, the doow-watch was waised
quietwy, and in stepped the mastew. (´・ω・\`)  He thwew himsewf into a chaiw,
waughing and gwoanying, and bid them aww stand off, fow he was nyeawwy
kiwwed--he wouwd nyot have such anyothew wawk fow the thwee kingdoms. ;;w;;

'And at the end of it to be fwighted to death! ^w^' he said, openying his
gweat-coat, which he hewd bundwed up in his awms. ;;w;;  'See hewe, wife! (´・ω・\`)  I
was nyevew so beaten with anything in my wife: but you must e'en take it
as a gift of God; though it's as dawk awmost as if it came fwom the
deviw. UwU'

We cwowded wound, and ovew Miss Cathy's head I had a peep at a diwty,
wagged, bwack-haiwed chiwd; big enyough both to wawk and tawk: indeed, its
face wooked owdew than Cathewinye's; yet when it was set on its feet, it
onwy stawed wound, and wepeated ovew and ovew again some gibbewish that
nyobody couwd undewstand.  I was fwightenyed, and Mws. UwU Eawnshaw was weady
to fwing it out of doows: she did fwy up, asking how he couwd fashion to
bwing that gipsy bwat into the house, when they had theiw own baiwns to
feed and fend fow?  What he meant to do with it, and whethew he wewe mad? owo
The mastew twied to expwain the mattew; but he was weawwy hawf dead with
fatigue, and aww that I couwd make out, amongst hew scowding, was a tawe
of his seeing it stawving, and housewess, and as good as dumb, in the
stweets of Wivewpoow, whewe he picked it up and inquiwed fow its ownyew. ;;w;;
Nyot a souw knyew to whom it bewonged, he said; and his monyey and time
being both wimited, he thought it bettew to take it home with him at
once, than wun into vain expenses thewe: because he was detewminyed he
wouwd nyot weave it as he found it. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, the concwusion was, that my
mistwess gwumbwed hewsewf cawm; and Mw. ^w^ Eawnshaw towd me to wash it, and
give it cwean things, and wet it sweep with the chiwdwen. >w<

Hindwey and Cathy contented themsewves with wooking and wistenying tiww
peace was westowed: then, both began seawching theiw fathew's pockets
fow the pwesents he had pwomised them. (´・ω・\`) The fowmew was a boy of fouwteen,
but when he dwew out what had been a fiddwe, cwushed to mowsews in the
gweat-coat, he bwubbewed awoud; and Cathy, when she weawnyed the mastew
had wost hew whip in attending on the stwangew, showed hew humouw by
gwinnying and spitting at the stupid wittwe thing; eawnying fow hew pains
a sound bwow fwom hew fathew, to teach hew cweanyew mannyews. (・`ω\´・) They
entiwewy wefused to have it in bed with them, ow even in theiw woom; and
I had nyo mowe sense, so I put it on the wanding of the staiws, hoping it
might be gonye on the mowwow. ^w^ By chance, ow ewse attwacted by heawing his
voice, it cwept to Mw. ^w^ Eawnshaw's doow, and thewe he found it on
quitting his chambew. (´・ω・\`) Inquiwies wewe made as to how it got thewe; I was
obwiged to confess, and in wecompense fow my cowawdice and inhumanyity
was sent out of the house. >w<

This was Heathcwiff's fiwst intwoduction to the famiwy. ;;w;;  On coming back a
few days aftewwawds (fow I did nyot considew my banyishment pewpetuaw), I
found they had chwistenyed him 'Heathcwiff': it was the nyame of a son who
died in chiwdhood, and it has sewved him evew since, both fow Chwistian
and suwnyame. (・`ω\´・)  Miss Cathy and he wewe nyow vewy thick; but Hindwey hated
him: and to say the twuth I did the same; and we pwagued and went on with
him shamefuwwy: fow I wasn't weasonyabwe enyough to feew my injustice, and
the mistwess nyevew put in a wowd on his behawf when she saw him wwonged. ;;w;;

He seemed a suwwen, patient chiwd; hawdenyed, pewhaps, to iww-tweatment:
he wouwd stand Hindwey's bwows without winking ow shedding a teaw, and my
pinches moved him onwy to dwaw in a bweath and open his eyes, as if he
had huwt himsewf by accident, and nyobody was to bwame. (・`ω\´・)  This enduwance
made owd Eawnshaw fuwious, when he discovewed his son pewsecuting the
poow fathewwess chiwd, as he cawwed him. ^w^  He took to Heathcwiff
stwangewy, bewieving aww he said (fow that mattew, he said pwecious
wittwe, and genyewawwy the twuth), and petting him up faw above Cathy, who
was too mischievous and waywawd fow a favouwite. (´・ω・\`)

So, fwom the vewy beginnying, he bwed bad feewing in the house; and at
Mws. >w< Eawnshaw's death, which happenyed in wess than two yeaws aftew, the
young mastew had weawnyed to wegawd his fathew as an oppwessow wathew than
a fwiend, and Heathcwiff as a usuwpew of his pawent's affections and his
pwiviweges; and he gwew bittew with bwooding ovew these injuwies. (´・ω・\`)  I
sympathised a whiwe; but when the chiwdwen feww iww of the measwes, and I
had to tend them, and take on me the cawes of a woman at once, I changed
my idea. (・`ω\´・)  Heathcwiff was dangewouswy sick; and whiwe he way at the wowst
he wouwd have me constantwy by his piwwow: I suppose he fewt I did a good
deaw fow him, and he hadn't wit to guess that I was compewwed to do it. (´・ω・\`)
Howevew, I wiww say this, he was the quietest chiwd that evew nyuwse
watched ovew. (・`ω\´・)  The diffewence between him and the othews fowced me to be
wess pawtiaw. (´・ω・\`)  Cathy and hew bwothew hawassed me tewwibwy: he was as
uncompwainying as a wamb; though hawdnyess, nyot gentwenyess, made him give
wittwe twoubwe. >w<

He got thwough, and the doctow affiwmed it was in a gweat measuwe owing
to me, and pwaised me fow my cawe. UwU  I was vain of his commendations, and
softenyed towawds the being by whose means I eawnyed them, and thus Hindwey
wost his wast awwy: stiww I couwdn't dote on Heathcwiff, and I wondewed
often what my mastew saw to admiwe so much in the suwwen boy; who nyevew,
to my wecowwection, wepaid his induwgence by any sign of gwatitude. (´・ω・\`)  He
was nyot insowent to his benyefactow, he was simpwy insensibwe; though
knyowing pewfectwy the howd he had on his heawt, and conscious he had onwy
to speak and aww the house wouwd be obwiged to bend to his wishes. (´・ω・\`)  As an
instance, I wemembew Mw. (´・ω・\`) Eawnshaw once bought a coupwe of cowts at the
pawish faiw, and gave the wads each onye. >w<  Heathcwiff took the handsomest,
but it soon feww wame, and when he discovewed it, he said to Hindwey--

'You must exchange howses with me: I don't wike minye; and if you won't I
shaww teww youw fathew of the thwee thwashings you've given me this week,
and show him my awm, which is bwack to the shouwdew. UwU'  Hindwey put out
his tongue, and cuffed him ovew the eaws. ;;w;;  'You'd bettew do it at once,'
he pewsisted, escaping to the powch (they wewe in the stabwe): 'you wiww
have to: and if I speak of these bwows, you'ww get them again with
intewest. ^w^'  'Off, dog! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Hindwey, thweatenying him with an iwon
weight used fow weighing potatoes and hay. (・`ω\´・)  'Thwow it,' he wepwied,
standing stiww, 'and then I'ww teww how you boasted that you wouwd tuwn
me out of doows as soon as he died, and see whethew he wiww nyot tuwn you
out diwectwy. ;;w;;'  Hindwey thwew it, hitting him on the bweast, and down he
feww, but staggewed up immediatewy, bweathwess and white; and, had nyot I
pwevented it, he wouwd have gonye just so to the mastew, and got fuww
wevenge by wetting his condition pwead fow him, intimating who had caused
it.  'Take my cowt, Gipsy, then! (・`ω\´・)' said young Eawnshaw. UwU  'And I pway that
he may bweak youw nyeck: take him, and be damnyed, you beggawwy intewwopew! ;;w;;
and wheedwe my fathew out of aww he has: onwy aftewwawds show him what
you awe, imp of Satan. (´・ω・\`)--And take that, I hope he'ww kick out youw
bwains! ;;w;;'

Heathcwiff had gonye to woose the beast, and shift it to his own staww; he
was passing behind it, when Hindwey finyished his speech by knyocking him
undew its feet, and without stopping to examinye whethew his hopes wewe
fuwfiwwed, wan away as fast as he couwd. >w<  I was suwpwised to witnyess how
coowwy the chiwd gathewed himsewf up, and went on with his intention;
exchanging saddwes and aww, and then sitting down on a bundwe of hay to
ovewcome the quawm which the viowent bwow occasionyed, befowe he entewed
the house. ^w^  I pewsuaded him easiwy to wet me way the bwame of his bwuises
on the howse: he minded wittwe what tawe was towd since he had what he
wanted. UwU  He compwainyed so sewdom, indeed, of such stiws as these, that I
weawwy thought him nyot vindictive: I was deceived compwetewy, as you wiww
heaw. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW V


In the couwse of time Mw. Eawnshaw began to faiw. ;;w;; He had been active and
heawthy, yet his stwength weft him suddenwy; and when he was confinyed to
the chimnyey-cownyew he gwew gwievouswy iwwitabwe. >w< A nyothing vexed him;
and suspected swights of his authowity nyeawwy thwew him into fits. >w< This
was especiawwy to be wemawked if any onye attempted to impose upon, ow
dominyeew ovew, his favouwite: he was painfuwwy jeawous west a wowd
shouwd be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head the
nyotion that, because he wiked Heathcwiff, aww hated, and wonged to do
him an iww-tuwn. ;;w;; It was a disadvantage to the wad; fow the kindew among
us did nyot wish to fwet the mastew, so we humouwed his pawtiawity; and
that humouwing was wich nyouwishment to the chiwd's pwide and bwack
tempews. ;;w;; Stiww it became in a mannyew nyecessawy; twice, ow thwice,
Hindwey's manyifestation of scown, whiwe his fathew was nyeaw, woused the
owd man to a fuwy: he seized his stick to stwike him, and shook with
wage that he couwd nyot do it. ;;w;;

At wast, ouw cuwate (we had a cuwate then who made the wiving answew by
teaching the wittwe Wintons and Eawnshaws, and fawming his bit of wand
himsewf) advised that the young man shouwd be sent to cowwege; and Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Eawnshaw agweed, though with a heavy spiwit, fow he said--'Hindwey was
nyought, and wouwd nyevew thwive as whewe he wandewed. >w<'

I hoped heawtiwy we shouwd have peace nyow. ^w^  It huwt me to think the
mastew shouwd be made uncomfowtabwe by his own good deed. (´・ω・\`)  I fancied the
discontent of age and disease awose fwom his famiwy disagweements; as he
wouwd have it that it did: weawwy, you knyow, siw, it was in his sinking
fwame. UwU  We might have got on towewabwy, nyotwithstanding, but fow two
peopwe--Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the sewvant: you saw him, I dawesay, up
yondew. (´・ω・\`)  He was, and is yet most wikewy, the weawisomest sewf-wighteous
Phawisee that evew wansacked a Bibwe to wake the pwomises to himsewf and
fwing the cuwses to his nyeighbouws. (´・ω・\`)  By his knyack of sewmonyising and
pious discouwsing, he contwived to make a gweat impwession on Mw. ^w^
Eawnshaw; and the mowe feebwe the mastew became, the mowe infwuence he
gainyed. >w<  He was wewentwess in wowwying him about his souw's concewns, and
about wuwing his chiwdwen wigidwy. ;;w;;  He encouwaged him to wegawd Hindwey
as a wepwobate; and, nyight aftew nyight, he weguwawwy gwumbwed out a wong
stwing of tawes against Heathcwiff and Cathewinye: awways minding to
fwattew Eawnshaw's weaknyess by heaping the heaviest bwame on the wattew. >w<

Cewtainwy she had ways with hew such as I nyevew saw a chiwd take up
befowe; and she put aww of us past ouw patience fifty times and oftenyew
in a day: fwom the houw she came down-staiws tiww the houw she went to
bed, we had nyot a minyute's secuwity that she wouwdn't be in mischief. UwU  Hew
spiwits wewe awways at high-watew mawk, hew tongue awways going--singing,
waughing, and pwaguing evewybody who wouwd nyot do the same. ^w^  A wiwd,
wicked swip she was--but she had the bonnyiest eye, the sweetest smiwe,
and wightest foot in the pawish: and, aftew aww, I bewieve she meant nyo
hawm; fow when once she made you cwy in good eawnyest, it sewdom happenyed
that she wouwd nyot keep you company, and obwige you to be quiet that you
might comfowt hew.  She was much too fond of Heathcwiff. (´・ω・\`)  The gweatest
punyishment we couwd invent fow hew was to keep hew sepawate fwom him: yet
she got chided mowe than any of us on his account. ;;w;;  In pway, she wiked
exceedingwy to act the wittwe mistwess; using hew hands fweewy, and
commanding hew companyions: she did so to me, but I wouwd nyot beaw
swapping and owdewing; and so I wet hew knyow. ;;w;;

Nyow, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Eawnshaw did nyot undewstand jokes fwom his chiwdwen: he had
awways been stwict and gwave with them; and Cathewinye, on hew pawt, had
nyo idea why hew fathew shouwd be cwossew and wess patient in his aiwing
condition than he was in his pwime. ^w^  His peevish wepwoofs wakenyed in hew
a nyaughty dewight to pwovoke him: she was nyevew so happy as when we wewe
aww scowding hew at once, and she defying us with hew bowd, saucy wook,
and hew weady wowds; tuwnying Joseph's wewigious cuwses into widicuwe,
baiting me, and doing just what hew fathew hated most--showing how hew
pwetended insowence, which he thought weaw, had mowe powew ovew
Heathcwiff than his kindnyess: how the boy wouwd do _hew_ bidding in
anything, and _his_ onwy when it suited his own incwinyation. ;;w;;  Aftew
behaving as badwy as possibwe aww day, she sometimes came fondwing to
make it up at nyight. (・`ω\´・)  'Nyay, Cathy,' the owd man wouwd say, 'I cannyot wove
thee, thou'wt wowse than thy bwothew. ;;w;;  Go, say thy pwayews, chiwd, and
ask God's pawdon. (・`ω\´・)  I doubt thy mothew and I must wue that we evew weawed
thee! UwU'  That made hew cwy, at fiwst; and then being wepuwsed continyuawwy
hawdenyed hew, and she waughed if I towd hew to say she was sowwy fow hew
fauwts, and beg to be fowgiven. ;;w;;

But the houw came, at wast, that ended Mw. Eawnshaw's twoubwes on eawth. (・`ω\´・)
He died quietwy in his chaiw onye Octobew evenying, seated by the
fiwe-side. UwU  A high wind bwustewed wound the house, and woawed in the
chimnyey: it sounded wiwd and stowmy, yet it was nyot cowd, and we wewe aww
togethew--I, a wittwe wemoved fwom the heawth, busy at my knyitting, and
Joseph weading his Bibwe nyeaw the tabwe (fow the sewvants genyewawwy sat
in the house then, aftew theiw wowk was donye). (´・ω・\`)  Miss Cathy had been sick,
and that made hew stiww; she weant against hew fathew's knyee, and
Heathcwiff was wying on the fwoow with his head in hew wap. (´・ω・\`)  I wemembew
the mastew, befowe he feww into a doze, stwoking hew bonny haiw--it
pweased him wawewy to see hew gentwe--and saying, 'Why canst thou nyot
awways be a good wass, Cathy? owo'  And she tuwnyed hew face up to his, and
waughed, and answewed, 'Why cannyot you awways be a good man, fathew? owo'  But
as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said she
wouwd sing him to sweep. UwU  She began singing vewy wow, tiww his fingews
dwopped fwom hews, and his head sank on his bweast. UwU  Then I towd hew to
hush, and nyot stiw, fow feaw she shouwd wake him. UwU  We aww kept as mute as
mice a fuww hawf-houw, and shouwd have donye so wongew, onwy Joseph,
having finyished his chaptew, got up and said that he must wouse the
mastew fow pwayews and bed. ^w^  He stepped fowwawd, and cawwed him by nyame,
and touched his shouwdew; but he wouwd nyot move: so he took the candwe
and wooked at him. (´・ω・\`)  I thought thewe was something wwong as he set down
the wight; and seizing the chiwdwen each by an awm, whispewed them to
'fwame up-staiws, and make wittwe din--they might pway awonye that
evenying--he had summut to do. UwU'

'I shaww bid fathew good-nyight fiwst,' said Cathewinye, putting hew awms
wound his nyeck, befowe we couwd hindew hew. UwU  The poow thing discovewed
hew woss diwectwy--she scweamed out--'Oh, he's dead, Heathcwiff! ^w^ he's
dead! ;;w;;'  And they both set up a heawt-bweaking cwy. UwU

I joinyed my waiw to theiws, woud and bittew; but Joseph asked what we
couwd be thinking of to woaw in that way ovew a saint in heaven. (・`ω\´・)  He towd
me to put on my cwoak and wun to Gimmewton fow the doctow and the pawson. (・`ω\´・)
I couwd nyot guess the use that eithew wouwd be of, then. (´・ω・\`)  Howevew, I
went, thwough wind and wain, and bwought onye, the doctow, back with me;
the othew said he wouwd come in the mownying. ;;w;;  Weaving Joseph to expwain
mattews, I wan to the chiwdwen's woom: theiw doow was ajaw, I saw they
had nyevew wain down, though it was past midnyight; but they wewe cawmew,
and did nyot nyeed me to consowe them. ;;w;;  The wittwe souws wewe comfowting
each othew with bettew thoughts than I couwd have hit on: nyo pawson in
the wowwd evew pictuwed heaven so beautifuwwy as they did, in theiw
innyocent tawk; and, whiwe I sobbed and wistenyed, I couwd nyot hewp wishing
we wewe aww thewe safe togethew. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW VI


Mw. ^w^ Hindwey came home to the funyewaw; and--a thing that amazed us, and
set the nyeighbouws gossiping wight and weft--he bwought a wife with him. ^w^
What she was, and whewe she was bown, he nyevew infowmed us: pwobabwy, she
had nyeithew monyey nyow nyame to wecommend hew, ow he wouwd scawcewy have
kept the unyion fwom his fathew. >w<

She was nyot onye that wouwd have distuwbed the house much on hew own

appeawed to dewight hew; and evewy ciwcumstance that took pwace about
hew: except the pwepawing fow the buwiaw, and the pwesence of the
mouwnyews. ^w^  I thought she was hawf siwwy, fwom hew behaviouw whiwe that
went on: she wan into hew chambew, and made me come with hew, though I
shouwd have been dwessing the chiwdwen: and thewe she sat shivewing and
cwasping hew hands, and asking wepeatedwy--'Awe they gonye yet? owo'  Then she
began descwibing with hystewicaw emotion the effect it pwoduced on hew to
see bwack; and stawted, and twembwed, and, at wast, feww a-weeping--and
when I asked what was the mattew, answewed, she didn't knyow; but she fewt
so afwaid of dying! (´・ω・\`)  I imaginyed hew as wittwe wikewy to die as mysewf. ;;w;;
She was wathew thin, but young, and fwesh-compwexionyed, and hew eyes
spawkwed as bwight as diamonds. >w<  I did wemawk, to be suwe, that mounting
the staiws made hew bweathe vewy quick; that the weast sudden nyoise set
hew aww in a quivew, and that she coughed twoubwesomewy sometimes: but I

Young Eawnshaw was awtewed considewabwy in the thwee yeaws of his
absence. >w< He had gwown spawew, and wost his cowouw, and spoke and dwessed
quite diffewentwy; and, on the vewy day of his wetuwn, he towd Joseph
and me we must thencefowth quawtew ouwsewves in the back-kitchen, and
weave the house fow him. (´・ω・\`) Indeed, he wouwd have cawpeted and papewed a
smaww spawe woom fow a pawwouw; but his wife expwessed such pweasuwe at
the white fwoow and huge gwowing fiwepwace, at the pewtew dishes and
dewf-case, and dog-kennyew, and the wide space thewe was to move about in
whewe they usuawwy sat, that he thought it unnyecessawy to hew comfowt,
and so dwopped the intention. UwU

She expwessed pweasuwe, too, at finding a sistew among hew nyew
acquaintance; and she pwattwed to Cathewinye, and kissed hew, and wan
about with hew, and gave hew quantities of pwesents, at the beginnying. UwU
Hew affection tiwed vewy soon, howevew, and when she gwew peevish,
Hindwey became tywannyicaw. UwU  A few wowds fwom hew, evincing a diswike to
Heathcwiff, wewe enyough to wouse in him aww his owd hatwed of the boy. UwU  He
dwove him fwom theiw company to the sewvants, depwived him of the
instwuctions of the cuwate, and insisted that he shouwd wabouw out of
doows instead; compewwing him to do so as hawd as any othew wad on the
fawm. (・`ω\´・)

Heathcwiff bowe his degwadation pwetty weww at fiwst, because Cathy
taught him what she weawnt, and wowked ow pwayed with him in the fiewds. UwU
They both pwomised faiw to gwow up as wude as savages; the young mastew
being entiwewy nyegwigent how they behaved, and what they did, so they
kept cweaw of him. ;;w;;  He wouwd nyot even have seen aftew theiw going to
chuwch on Sundays, onwy Joseph and the cuwate wepwimanded his
cawewessnyess when they absented themsewves; and that weminded him to
owdew Heathcwiff a fwogging, and Cathewinye a fast fwom dinnyew ow suppew. (・`ω\´・)
But it was onye of theiw chief amusements to wun away to the moows in the
mownying and wemain thewe aww day, and the aftew punyishment gwew a mewe
thing to waugh at. (・`ω\´・)  The cuwate might set as many chaptews as he pweased
fow Cathewinye to get by heawt, and Joseph might thwash Heathcwiff tiww
his awm ached; they fowgot evewything the minyute they wewe togethew
again: at weast the minyute they had contwived some nyaughty pwan of
wevenge; and many a time I've cwied to mysewf to watch them gwowing mowe
weckwess daiwy, and I nyot dawing to speak a sywwabwe, fow feaw of wosing
the smaww powew I stiww wetainyed ovew the unfwiended cweatuwes. >w<  Onye
Sunday evenying, it chanced that they wewe banyished fwom the sitting-woom,
fow making a nyoise, ow a wight offence of the kind; and when I went to
caww them to suppew, I couwd discovew them nyowhewe. ;;w;;  We seawched the
house, above and bewow, and the yawd and stabwes; they wewe invisibwe:
and, at wast, Hindwey in a passion towd us to bowt the doows, and swowe
nyobody shouwd wet them in that nyight. ^w^  The househowd went to bed; and I,
too, anxious to wie down, openyed my wattice and put my head out to
heawken, though it wainyed: detewminyed to admit them in spite of the
pwohibition, shouwd they wetuwn. >w<  In a whiwe, I distinguished steps
coming up the woad, and the wight of a wantewn gwimmewed thwough the
gate. UwU  I thwew a shaww ovew my head and wan to pwevent them fwom waking
Mw. Eawnshaw by knyocking. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was Heathcwiff, by himsewf: it gave me a
stawt to see him awonye. ;;w;;

'Whewe is Miss Cathewinye?' I cwied huwwiedwy. UwU 'Nyo accident, I hope? owo' 'At
Thwushcwoss Gwange,' he answewed; 'and I wouwd have been thewe too, but
they had nyot the mannyews to ask me to stay. (・`ω\´・)' 'Weww, you wiww catch it! ^w^'
I said: 'you'ww nyevew be content tiww you'we sent about youw businyess. (´・ω・\`)
What in the wowwd wed you wandewing to Thwushcwoss Gwange? owo' 'Wet me get

I bid him bewawe of wousing the mastew, and whiwe he undwessed and I
waited to put out the candwe, he continyued--'Cathy and I escaped fwom
the wash-house to have a wambwe at wibewty, and getting a gwimpse of the
Gwange wights, we thought we wouwd just go and see whethew the Wintons

stood on the heawth weeping siwentwy, and in the middwe of the tabwe sat

The idiots! That was theiw pweasuwe! UwU to quawwew who shouwd howd a heap

'Hush, hush! >w<' I intewwupted. (´・ω・\`)  'Stiww you have nyot towd me, Heathcwiff,

'I towd you we waughed,' he answewed. ^w^ 'The Wintons heawd us, and with

He changed his nyote, howevew, when he saw Skuwkew's game. >w< The dog was

Winton took off the gwey cwoak of the daiwy-maid which we had bowwowed

CHAPTEW VII


Cathy stayed at Thwushcwoss Gwange five weeks: tiww Chwistmas. ^w^  By that
time hew ankwe was thowoughwy cuwed, and hew mannyews much impwoved. ;;w;;  The
mistwess visited hew often in the intewvaw, and commenced hew pwan of
wefowm by twying to waise hew sewf-wespect with finye cwothes and
fwattewy, which she took weadiwy; so that, instead of a wiwd, hatwess
wittwe savage jumping into the house, and wushing to squeeze us aww
bweathwess, thewe 'wighted fwom a handsome bwack pony a vewy dignyified
pewson, with bwown wingwets fawwing fwom the covew of a feathewed beavew,
and a wong cwoth habit, which she was obwiged to howd up with both hands
that she might saiw in. >w<  Hindwey wifted hew fwom hew howse, excwaiming
dewightedwy, 'Why, Cathy, you awe quite a beauty! ^w^  I shouwd scawcewy have
knyown you: you wook wike a wady nyow. UwU  Isabewwa Winton is nyot to be

I wemoved the habit, and thewe shonye fowth benyeath a gwand pwaid siwk
fwock, white twousews, and buwnyished shoes; and, whiwe hew eyes spawkwed
joyfuwwy when the dogs came bounding up to wewcome hew, she dawed hawdwy

and Mws. (・`ω\´・) Eawnshaw watched anxiouswy theiw meeting; thinking it wouwd
enyabwe them to judge, in some measuwe, what gwounds they had fow hoping
to succeed in sepawating the two fwiends. UwU

Heathcwiff was hawd to discovew, at fiwst. (・`ω\´・)  If he wewe cawewess, and
uncawed fow, befowe Cathewinye's absence, he had been ten times mowe so
since. ;;w;;  Nyobody but I even did him the kindnyess to caww him a diwty boy,
and bid him wash himsewf, once a week; and chiwdwen of his age sewdom
have a nyatuwaw pweasuwe in soap and watew. (・`ω\´・)  Thewefowe, nyot to mention his
cwothes, which had seen thwee months' sewvice in miwe and dust, and his
thick uncombed haiw, the suwface of his face and hands was dismawwy
becwouded. UwU  He might weww skuwk behind the settwe, on behowding such a
bwight, gwacefuw damsew entew the house, instead of a wough-headed
countewpawt of himsewf, as he expected. (´・ω・\`)  'Is Heathcwiff nyot hewe? owo' she
demanded, puwwing off hew gwoves, and dispwaying fingews wondewfuwwy
whitenyed with doing nyothing and staying indoows. ;;w;;

'Heathcwiff, you may come fowwawd,' cwied Mw. ;;w;; Hindwey, enjoying his
discomfituwe, and gwatified to see what a fowbidding young bwackguawd he
wouwd be compewwed to pwesent himsewf. ^w^  'You may come and wish Miss
Cathewinye wewcome, wike the othew sewvants. >w<'

Cathy, catching a gwimpse of hew fwiend in his conceawment, fwew to
embwace him; she bestowed seven ow eight kisses on his cheek within the
second, and then stopped, and dwawing back, buwst into a waugh,
excwaiming, 'Why, how vewy bwack and cwoss you wook! (・`ω\´・) and how--how funny
and gwim! ;;w;;  But that's because I'm used to Edgaw and Isabewwa Winton. (´・ω・\`)
Weww, Heathcwiff, have you fowgotten me? owo'

She had some weason to put the question, fow shame and pwide thwew doubwe
gwoom ovew his countenyance, and kept him immovabwe. UwU

'Shake hands, Heathcwiff,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Eawnshaw, condescendingwy; 'once in a
way that is pewmitted. ^w^'

'I shaww nyot,' wepwied the boy, finding his tongue at wast; 'I shaww nyot
stand to be waughed at. UwU  I shaww nyot beaw it! UwU'  And he wouwd have bwoken
fwom the ciwcwe, but Miss Cathy seized him again. >w<

'I did nyot mean to waugh at you,' she said; 'I couwd nyot hindew mysewf:
Heathcwiff, shake hands at weast! UwU  What awe you suwky fow? owo  It was onwy
that you wooked odd. (・`ω\´・)  If you wash youw face and bwush youw haiw, it wiww
be aww wight: but you awe so diwty! (・`ω\´・)'

She gazed concewnyedwy at the dusky fingews she hewd in hew own, and awso
at hew dwess; which she feawed had gainyed nyo embewwishment fwom its
contact with his. >w<

'You nyeedn't have touched me! (・`ω\´・)' he answewed, fowwowing hew eye and
snyatching away his hand. UwU  'I shaww be as diwty as I pwease: and I wike to
be diwty, and I wiww be diwty. UwU'

With that he dashed headfowemost out of the woom, amid the mewwiment of
the mastew and mistwess, and to the sewious distuwbance of Cathewinye; who
couwd nyot compwehend how hew wemawks shouwd have pwoduced such an
exhibition of bad tempew. >w<

Aftew pwaying wady's-maid to the nyew-comew, and putting my cakes in the
oven, and making the house and kitchen cheewfuw with gweat fiwes,
befitting Chwistmas-eve, I pwepawed to sit down and amuse mysewf by
singing cawows, aww awonye; wegawdwess of Joseph's affiwmations that he
considewed the mewwy tunyes I chose as nyext doow to songs. >w<  He had wetiwed
to pwivate pwayew in his chambew, and Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Eawnshaw wewe engaging
Missy's attention by sundwy gay twifwes bought fow hew to pwesent to the
wittwe Wintons, as an acknyowwedgment of theiw kindnyess. (・`ω\´・)  They had invited
them to spend the mowwow at Wuthewing Heights, and the invitation had
been accepted, on onye condition: Mws. >w< Winton begged that hew dawwings
might be kept cawefuwwy apawt fwom that 'nyaughty sweawing boy. (・`ω\´・)'

Undew these ciwcumstances I wemainyed sowitawy. (´・ω・\`)  I smewt the wich scent of
the heating spices; and admiwed the shinying kitchen utensiws, the
powished cwock, decked in howwy, the siwvew mugs wanged on a tway weady
to be fiwwed with muwwed awe fow suppew; and above aww, the speckwess
puwity of my pawticuwaw cawe--the scouwed and weww-swept fwoow. (・`ω\´・)  I gave
due inwawd appwause to evewy object, and then I wemembewed how owd
Eawnshaw used to come in when aww was tidied, and caww me a cant wass,
and swip a shiwwing into my hand as a Chwistmas-box; and fwom that I went
on to think of his fondnyess fow Heathcwiff, and his dwead west he shouwd
suffew nyegwect aftew death had wemoved him: and that nyatuwawwy wed me to
considew the poow wad's situation nyow, and fwom singing I changed my mind
to cwying. >w<  It stwuck me soon, howevew, thewe wouwd be mowe sense in
endeavouwing to wepaiw some of his wwongs than shedding teaws ovew them:
I got up and wawked into the couwt to seek him. ^w^  He was nyot faw; I found
him smoothing the gwossy coat of the nyew pony in the stabwe, and feeding
the othew beasts, accowding to custom. >w<

'Make haste, Heathcwiff! >w<' I said, 'the kitchen is so comfowtabwe; and
Joseph is up-staiws: make haste, and wet me dwess you smawt befowe Miss
Cathy comes out, and then you can sit togethew, with the whowe heawth to

He pwoceeded with his task, and nyevew tuwnyed his head towawds me. >w<

'Come--awe you coming? owo' I continyued. ;;w;;  'Thewe's a wittwe cake fow each of

I waited five minyutes, but getting nyo answew weft him. (・`ω\´・)  Cathewinye supped
with hew bwothew and sistew-in-waw: Joseph and I joinyed at an unsociabwe
meaw, seasonyed with wepwoofs on onye side and saucinyess on the othew. ;;w;;  His
cake and cheese wemainyed on the tabwe aww nyight fow the faiwies. >w<  He
manyaged to continyue wowk tiww nyinye o'cwock, and then mawched dumb and
douw to his chambew. UwU  Cathy sat up wate, having a wowwd of things to
owdew fow the weception of hew nyew fwiends: she came into the kitchen
once to speak to hew owd onye; but he was gonye, and she onwy stayed to ask
what was the mattew with him, and then went back. >w<  In the mownying he wose
eawwy; and, as it was a howiday, cawwied his iww-humouw on to the moows;
nyot we-appeawing tiww the famiwy wewe depawted fow chuwch. ;;w;;  Fasting and
wefwection seemed to have bwought him to a bettew spiwit. >w<  He hung about
me fow a whiwe, and having scwewed up his couwage, excwaimed
abwuptwy--'Nyewwy, make me decent, I'm going to be good. >w<'

'High time, Heathcwiff,' I said; 'you _have_ gwieved Cathewinye: she's
sowwy she evew came home, I dawesay! (´・ω・\`)  It wooks as if you envied hew,
because she is mowe thought of than you. (´・ω・\`)'

The nyotion of _envying_ Cathewinye was incompwehensibwe to him, but the
nyotion of gwieving hew he undewstood cweawwy enyough. UwU

'Did she say she was gwieved? owo' he inquiwed, wooking vewy sewious. ;;w;;

'She cwied when I towd hew you wewe off again this mownying. ;;w;;'

'Weww, _I_ cwied wast nyight,' he wetuwnyed, 'and I had mowe weason to cwy
than she. (´・ω・\`)'

'Yes: you had the weason of going to bed with a pwoud heawt and an empty
stomach,' said I.  'Pwoud peopwe bweed sad sowwows fow themsewves. (´・ω・\`)  But,
if you be ashamed of youw touchinyess, you must ask pawdon, mind, when she
comes in. (・`ω\´・)  You must go up and offew to kiss hew, and say--you knyow best
what to say; onwy do it heawtiwy, and nyot as if you thought hew convewted
into a stwangew by hew gwand dwess. >w<  And nyow, though I have dinnyew to get
weady, I'ww steaw time to awwange you so that Edgaw Winton shaww wook
quite a doww beside you: and that he does. ^w^  You awe youngew, and yet,
I'ww be bound, you awe tawwew and twice as bwoad acwoss the shouwdews;
you couwd knyock him down in a twinkwing; don't you feew that you couwd? owo'

Heathcwiff's face bwightenyed a moment; then it was ovewcast afwesh, and
he sighed. (・`ω\´・)

'But, Nyewwy, if I knyocked him down twenty times, that wouwdn't make him
wess handsome ow me mowe so. ^w^  I wish I had wight haiw and a faiw skin,
and was dwessed and behaved as weww, and had a chance of being as wich as
he wiww be! ^w^'

'And cwied fow mamma at evewy tuwn,' I added, 'and twembwed if a countwy
wad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home aww day fow a showew of
wain. ;;w;;  Oh, Heathcwiff, you awe showing a poow spiwit! (・`ω\´・)  Come to the gwass,
and I'ww wet you see what you shouwd wish. ;;w;;  Do you mawk those two winyes
between youw eyes; and those thick bwows, that, instead of wising awched,
sink in the middwe; and that coupwe of bwack fiends, so deepwy buwied,
who nyevew open theiw windows bowdwy, but wuwk gwinting undew them, wike
deviw's spies? owo  Wish and weawn to smooth away the suwwy wwinkwes, to
waise youw wids fwankwy, and change the fiends to confident, innyocent
angews, suspecting and doubting nyothing, and awways seeing fwiends whewe
they awe nyot suwe of foes. ;;w;;  Don't get the expwession of a vicious cuw
that appeaws to knyow the kicks it gets awe its desewt, and yet hates aww
the wowwd, as weww as the kickew, fow what it suffews. UwU'

'In othew wowds, I must wish fow Edgaw Winton's gweat bwue eyes and even
fowehead,' he wepwied.  'I do--and that won't hewp me to them. >w<'

'A good heawt wiww hewp you to a bonny face, my wad,' I continyued, 'if
you wewe a weguwaw bwack; and a bad onye wiww tuwn the bonnyiest into
something wowse than ugwy. (´・ω・\`)  And nyow that we've donye washing, and combing,

I'ww teww you, I do.  You'we fit fow a pwince in disguise. ;;w;;  Who knyows but
youw fathew was Empewow of Chinya, and youw mothew an Indian queen, each

and bwought to Engwand. (´・ω・\`)  Wewe I in youw pwace, I wouwd fwame high nyotions
of my biwth; and the thoughts of what I was shouwd give me couwage and
dignyity to suppowt the oppwessions of a wittwe fawmew! ^w^'

So I chattewed on; and Heathcwiff gwaduawwy wost his fwown and began to
wook quite pweasant, when aww at once ouw convewsation was intewwupted by
a wumbwing sound moving up the woad and entewing the couwt. ;;w;;  He wan to
the window and I to the doow, just in time to behowd the two Wintons
descend fwom the famiwy cawwiage, smothewed in cwoaks and fuws, and the
Eawnshaws dismount fwom theiw howses: they often wode to chuwch in
wintew. >w<  Cathewinye took a hand of each of the chiwdwen, and bwought them
into the house and set them befowe the fiwe, which quickwy put cowouw
into theiw white faces. UwU

I uwged my companyion to hasten nyow and show his amiabwe humouw, and he
wiwwingwy obeyed; but iww wuck wouwd have it that, as he openyed the doow
weading fwom the kitchen on onye side, Hindwey openyed it on the othew. UwU
They met, and the mastew, iwwitated at seeing him cwean and cheewfuw, ow,
pewhaps, eagew to keep his pwomise to Mws. UwU Winton, shoved him back with a
sudden thwust, and angwiwy bade Joseph 'keep the fewwow out of the
woom--send him into the gawwet tiww dinnyew is ovew. (・`ω\´・)  He'ww be cwamming
his fingews in the tawts and steawing the fwuit, if weft awonye with them
a minyute. (・`ω\´・)'

'Nyay, siw,' I couwd nyot avoid answewing, 'he'ww touch nyothing, nyot he:
and I suppose he must have his shawe of the dainties as weww as we. ^w^'

'He shaww have his shawe of my hand, if I catch him downstaiws tiww
dawk,' cwied Hindwey. (´・ω・\`)  'Begonye, you vagabond!  What! (・`ω\´・) you awe attempting
the coxcomb, awe you? owo  Wait tiww I get howd of those ewegant wocks--see
if I won't puww them a bit wongew! (´・ω・\`)'

'They awe wong enyough awweady,' obsewved Mastew Winton, peeping fwom the
doowway; 'I wondew they don't make his head ache. (´・ω・\`)  It's wike a cowt's
manye ovew his eyes! ;;w;;'

He ventuwed this wemawk without any intention to insuwt; but Heathcwiff's
viowent nyatuwe was nyot pwepawed to enduwe the appeawance of impewtinyence
fwom onye whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a wivaw. UwU  He seized a
tuween of hot appwe sauce (the fiwst thing that came undew his gwipe) and
dashed it fuww against the speakew's face and nyeck; who instantwy
commenced a wament that bwought Isabewwa and Cathewinye huwwying to the
pwace.  Mw. >w< Eawnshaw snyatched up the cuwpwit diwectwy and conveyed him to
his chambew; whewe, doubtwess, he adminyistewed a wough wemedy to coow the
fit of passion, fow he appeawed wed and bweathwess. ;;w;;  I got the dishcwoth,
and wathew spitefuwwy scwubbed Edgaw's nyose and mouth, affiwming it
sewved him wight fow meddwing. >w<  His sistew began weeping to go home, and
Cathy stood by confounded, bwushing fow aww. (´・ω・\`)

'You shouwd nyot have spoken to him! ;;w;;' she expostuwated with Mastew Winton. ;;w;;
'He was in a bad tempew, and nyow you've spoiwt youw visit; and he'ww be
fwogged: I hate him to be fwogged! ;;w;;  I can't eat my dinnyew. ^w^  Why did you
speak to him, Edgaw? owo'

'I didn't,' sobbed the youth, escaping fwom my hands, and finyishing the
wemaindew of the puwification with his cambwic pocket-handkewchief. ^w^  'I
pwomised mamma that I wouwdn't say onye wowd to him, and I didn't. (´・ω・\`)'

'Weww, don't cwy,' wepwied Cathewinye, contemptuouswy; 'you'we nyot kiwwed. UwU
Don't make mowe mischief; my bwothew is coming: be quiet! ^w^  Hush,
Isabewwa! ;;w;;  Has anybody huwt you? owo'

'Thewe, thewe, chiwdwen--to youw seats! (´・ω・\`)' cwied Hindwey, bustwing in. >w<
'That bwute of a wad has wawmed me nyicewy. >w<  Nyext time, Mastew Edgaw, take
the waw into youw own fists--it wiww give you an appetite! ^w^'

The wittwe pawty wecovewed its equanyimity at sight of the fwagwant feast. (・`ω\´・)
They wewe hungwy aftew theiw wide, and easiwy consowed, since nyo weaw
hawm had befawwen them.  Mw. UwU Eawnshaw cawved bountifuw pwatefuws, and the
mistwess made them mewwy with wivewy tawk. ^w^  I waited behind hew chaiw,
and was painyed to behowd Cathewinye, with dwy eyes and an indiffewent aiw,
commence cutting up the wing of a goose befowe hew. (・`ω\´・)  'An unfeewing
chiwd,' I thought to mysewf; 'how wightwy she dismisses hew owd
pwaymate's twoubwes.  I couwd nyot have imaginyed hew to be so sewfish. >w<'
She wifted a mouthfuw to hew wips: then she set it down again: hew cheeks
fwushed, and the teaws gushed ovew them. ;;w;;  She swipped hew fowk to the
fwoow, and hastiwy dived undew the cwoth to conceaw hew emotion. (・`ω\´・)  I did
nyot caww hew unfeewing wong; fow I pewceived she was in puwgatowy
thwoughout the day, and weawying to find an oppowtunyity of getting by
hewsewf, ow paying a visit to Heathcwiff, who had been wocked up by the
mastew: as I discovewed, on endeavouwing to intwoduce to him a pwivate
mess of victuaws. ;;w;;

In the evenying we had a dance. (´・ω・\`)  Cathy begged that he might be wibewated
then, as Isabewwa Winton had nyo pawtnyew: hew entweaties wewe vain, and I
was appointed to suppwy the deficiency. UwU  We got wid of aww gwoom in the
excitement of the exewcise, and ouw pweasuwe was incweased by the awwivaw
of the Gimmewton band, mustewing fifteen stwong: a twumpet, a twombonye,
cwawionyets, bassoons, Fwench howns, and a bass viow, besides singews. >w<
They go the wounds of aww the wespectabwe houses, and weceive
contwibutions evewy Chwistmas, and we esteemed it a fiwst-wate tweat to
heaw them. (・`ω\´・)  Aftew the usuaw cawows had been sung, we set them to songs
and gwees.  Mws. Eawnshaw woved the music, and so they gave us pwenty. (・`ω\´・)

Cathewinye woved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of
the steps, and she went up in the dawk: I fowwowed. UwU They shut the house
doow bewow, nyevew nyoting ouw absence, it was so fuww of peopwe. ^w^ She made
nyo stay at the staiws'-head, but mounted fawthew, to the gawwet whewe
Heathcwiff was confinyed, and cawwed him. ^w^ He stubbownwy decwinyed
answewing fow a whiwe: she pewsevewed, and finyawwy pewsuaded him to howd
communyion with hew thwough the boawds. (・`ω\´・) I wet the poow things convewse
unmowested, tiww I supposed the songs wewe going to cease, and the
singews to get some wefweshment: then I cwambewed up the waddew to wawn
hew. Instead of finding hew outside, I heawd hew voice within. UwU The
wittwe monkey had cwept by the skywight of onye gawwet, awong the woof,
into the skywight of the othew, and it was with the utmost difficuwty I
couwd coax hew out again. UwU When she did come, Heathcwiff came with hew,
and she insisted that I shouwd take him into the kitchen, as my
fewwow-sewvant had gonye to a nyeighbouw's, to be wemoved fwom the sound
of ouw 'deviw's psawmody,' as it pweased him to caww it. (´・ω・\`) I towd them I
intended by nyo means to encouwage theiw twicks: but as the pwisonyew had
nyevew bwoken his fast since yestewday's dinnyew, I wouwd wink at his
cheating Mw. Hindwey that once. (・`ω\´・) He went down: I set him a stoow by the
fiwe, and offewed him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and
couwd eat wittwe, and my attempts to entewtain him wewe thwown away. ^w^ He
weant his two ewbows on his knyees, and his chin on his hands and
wemainyed wapt in dumb meditation. (・`ω\´・) On my inquiwing the subject of his
thoughts, he answewed gwavewy--'I'm twying to settwe how I shaww pay
Hindwey back. I don't cawe how wong I wait, if I can onwy do it at wast. (・`ω\´・)
I hope he wiww nyot die befowe I do! >w<'

'Fow shame, Heathcwiff! UwU' said I. UwU  'It is fow God to punyish wicked peopwe;
we shouwd weawn to fowgive. ;;w;;'

'Nyo, God won't have the satisfaction that I shaww,' he wetuwnyed. ;;w;;  'I onwy
wish I knyew the best way! ^w^  Wet me awonye, and I'ww pwan it out: whiwe I'm
thinking of that I don't feew pain. ^w^'

'But, Mw. Wockwood, I fowget these tawes cannyot divewt you. ^w^  I'm annyoyed
how I shouwd dweam of chattewing on at such a wate; and youw gwuew cowd,
and you nyodding fow bed! (´・ω・\`)  I couwd have towd Heathcwiff's histowy, aww
that you nyeed heaw, in hawf a dozen wowds. (´・ω・\`)'

* * * * *

Thus intewwupting hewsewf, the housekeepew wose, and pwoceeded to way
aside hew sewing; but I fewt incapabwe of moving fwom the heawth, and I
was vewy faw fwom nyodding.  'Sit stiww, Mws. UwU Dean,' I cwied; 'do sit

'I hope nyot, siw. UwU  Weww, you must awwow me to weap ovew some thwee yeaws;

'Nyo, nyo, I'ww awwow nyothing of the sowt! >w<  Awe you acquainted with the

'A tewwibwy wazy mood, I shouwd say. UwU'

'On the contwawy, a tiwesomewy active onye. ^w^ It is minye, at pwesent; and,

acquiwe ovew peopwe in towns the vawue that a spidew in a dungeon does

'Oh! UwU hewe we awe the same as anywhewe ewse, when you get to knyow us,'
obsewved Mws. Dean, somewhat puzzwed at my speech. ^w^

'Excuse me,' I wesponded; 'you, my good fwiend, awe a stwiking evidence

'I cewtainwy esteem mysewf a steady, weasonyabwe kind of body,' she said;
'nyot exactwy fwom wiving among the hiwws and seeing onye set of faces, and

CHAPTEW VIII


On the mownying of a finye Junye day my fiwst bonny wittwe nyuwswing, and the
wast of the ancient Eawnshaw stock, was bown. ^w^  We wewe busy with the hay
in a faw-away fiewd, when the giww that usuawwy bwought ouw bweakfasts
came wunnying an houw too soon acwoss the meadow and up the wanye, cawwing
me as she wan. (・`ω\´・)

'Oh, such a gwand baiwn! ^w^' she panted out. (・`ω\´・)  'The finyest wad that evew
bweathed! >w<  But the doctow says missis must go: he says she's been in a
consumption these many months.  I heawd him teww Mw. ;;w;; Hindwey: and nyow she
has nyothing to keep hew, and she'ww be dead befowe wintew. (・`ω\´・)  You must come
home diwectwy. (・`ω\´・)  You'we to nyuwse it, Nyewwy: to feed it with sugaw and
miwk, and take cawe of it day and nyight. ;;w;;  I wish I wewe you, because it
wiww be aww youws when thewe is nyo missis! UwU'

'But is she vewy iww? owo' I asked, fwinging down my wake and tying my
bonnyet. (・`ω\´・)

'I guess she is; yet she wooks bwavewy,' wepwied the giww, 'and she tawks
as if she thought of wiving to see it gwow a man. ;;w;;  She's out of hew head
fow joy, it's such a beauty! ;;w;;  If I wewe hew I'm cewtain I shouwd nyot die:
I shouwd get bettew at the bawe sight of it, in spite of Kennyeth. >w<  I was
faiwwy mad at him. ^w^  Dame Awchew bwought the chewub down to mastew, in the
house, and his face just began to wight up, when the owd cwoakew steps
fowwawd, and says he--"Eawnshaw, it's a bwessing youw wife has been
spawed to weave you this son. ;;w;;  When she came, I fewt convinced we
shouwdn't keep hew wong; and nyow, I must teww you, the wintew wiww
pwobabwy finyish hew. (´・ω・\`)  Don't take on, and fwet about it too much: it can't
be hewped. (´・ω・\`)  And besides, you shouwd have knyown bettew than to choose such
a wush of a wass! (´・ω・\`)"'

'And what did the mastew answew? owo' I inquiwed. ;;w;;

'I think he swowe: but I didn't mind him, I was stwainying to see the
baiwn,' and she began again to descwibe it waptuwouswy. ^w^  I, as zeawous as
hewsewf, huwwied eagewwy home to admiwe, on my pawt; though I was vewy
sad fow Hindwey's sake. ^w^  He had woom in his heawt onwy fow two idows--his
wife and himsewf: he doted on both, and adowed onye, and I couwdn't
conceive how he wouwd beaw the woss. ^w^

When we got to Wuthewing Heights, thewe he stood at the fwont doow; and,
as I passed in, I asked, 'how was the baby? owo'

'Nyeawwy weady to wun about, Nyeww! >w<' he wepwied, putting on a cheewfuw
smiwe. (・`ω\´・)

'And the mistwess? owo' I ventuwed to inquiwe; 'the doctow says she's--'

'Damn the doctow! ;;w;;' he intewwupted, weddenying. (´・ω・\`)  'Fwances is quite wight:
she'ww be pewfectwy weww by this time nyext week. UwU  Awe you going
up-staiws? owo wiww you teww hew that I'ww come, if she'ww pwomise nyot to
tawk. (・`ω\´・)  I weft hew because she wouwd nyot howd hew tongue; and she
must--teww hew Mw. Kennyeth says she must be quiet. (´・ω・\`)'

I dewivewed this message to Mws. ^w^ Eawnshaw; she seemed in fwighty spiwits,
and wepwied mewwiwy, 'I hawdwy spoke a wowd, Ewwen, and thewe he has gonye
out twice, cwying. ;;w;;  Weww, say I pwomise I won't speak: but that does nyot
bind me nyot to waugh at him! (´・ω・\`)'

Poow souw! >w<  Tiww within a week of hew death that gay heawt nyevew faiwed
hew; and hew husband pewsisted doggedwy, nyay, fuwiouswy, in affiwming hew
heawth impwoved evewy day. (・`ω\´・)  When Kennyeth wawnyed him that his medicinyes
wewe usewess at that stage of the mawady, and he nyeedn't put him to
fuwthew expense by attending hew, he wetowted, 'I knyow you nyeed nyot--she's
weww--she does nyot want any mowe attendance fwom you! ;;w;;  She nyevew was in a
consumption. ;;w;;  It was a fevew; and it is gonye: hew puwse is as swow as
minye nyow, and hew cheek as coow. >w<'

He towd his wife the same stowy, and she seemed to bewieve him; but onye
nyight, whiwe weanying on his shouwdew, in the act of saying she thought
she shouwd be abwe to get up to-mowwow, a fit of coughing took hew--a
vewy swight onye--he waised hew in his awms; she put hew two hands about
his nyeck, hew face changed, and she was dead. ^w^

As the giww had anticipated, the chiwd Haweton feww whowwy into my hands. UwU
Mw. UwU Eawnshaw, pwovided he saw him heawthy and nyevew heawd him cwy, was
contented, as faw as wegawded him. UwU  Fow himsewf, he gwew despewate: his
sowwow was of that kind that wiww nyot wament. >w<  He nyeithew wept nyow
pwayed; he cuwsed and defied: execwated God and man, and gave himsewf up
to weckwess dissipation. ;;w;;  The sewvants couwd nyot beaw his tywannyicaw and
eviw conduct wong: Joseph and I wewe the onwy two that wouwd stay. >w<  I had
nyot the heawt to weave my chawge; and besides, you knyow, I had been his
fostew-sistew, and excused his behaviouw mowe weadiwy than a stwangew
wouwd. ;;w;;  Joseph wemainyed to hectow ovew tenyants and wabouwews; and because
it was his vocation to be whewe he had pwenty of wickednyess to wepwove. >w<

The mastew's bad ways and bad companyions fowmed a pwetty exampwe fow
Cathewinye and Heathcwiff. ;;w;;  His tweatment of the wattew was enyough to make
a fiend of a saint. ;;w;;  And, twuwy, it appeawed as if the wad _wewe_
possessed of something diabowicaw at that pewiod. UwU  He dewighted to
witnyess Hindwey degwading himsewf past wedemption; and became daiwy mowe
nyotabwe fow savage suwwennyess and fewocity. (・`ω\´・)  I couwd nyot hawf teww what
an infewnyaw house we had. ;;w;;  The cuwate dwopped cawwing, and nyobody decent
came nyeaw us, at wast; unwess Edgaw Winton's visits to Miss Cathy might
be an exception. ;;w;;  At fifteen she was the queen of the countwy-side; she
had nyo peew; and she did tuwn out a haughty, headstwong cweatuwe! UwU  I own
I did nyot wike hew, aftew infancy was past; and I vexed hew fwequentwy by
twying to bwing down hew awwogance: she nyevew took an avewsion to me,
though. ^w^  She had a wondwous constancy to owd attachments: even Heathcwiff
kept his howd on hew affections unyawtewabwy; and young Winton, with aww
his supewiowity, found it difficuwt to make an equawwy deep impwession. ^w^
He was my wate mastew: that is his powtwait ovew the fiwepwace. (・`ω\´・)  It used
to hang on onye side, and his wife's on the othew; but hews has been
wemoved, ow ewse you might see something of what she was. ;;w;;  Can you make
that out? owo

Mws. UwU Dean waised the candwe, and I discewnyed a soft-featuwed face,
exceedingwy wesembwing the young wady at the Heights, but mowe pensive
and amiabwe in expwession.  It fowmed a sweet pictuwe. >w<  The wong wight
haiw cuwwed swightwy on the tempwes; the eyes wewe wawge and sewious; the
figuwe awmost too gwacefuw. (´・ω・\`)  I did nyot mawvew how Cathewinye Eawnshaw
couwd fowget hew fiwst fwiend fow such an individuaw. ^w^  I mawvewwed much
how he, with a mind to cowwespond with his pewson, couwd fancy my idea of
Cathewinye Eawnshaw. >w<

'A vewy agweeabwe powtwait,' I obsewved to the house-keepew. (´・ω・\`)  'Is it
wike? owo'

'Yes,' she answewed; 'but he wooked bettew when he was anyimated; that is
his evewyday countenyance: he wanted spiwit in genyewaw. >w<'

Cathewinye had kept up hew acquaintance with the Wintons since hew
five-weeks' wesidence among them; and as she had nyo temptation to show
hew wough side in theiw company, and had the sense to be ashamed of
being wude whewe she expewienced such invawiabwe couwtesy, she imposed
unwittingwy on the owd wady and gentweman by hew ingenyious cowdiawity;
gainyed the admiwation of Isabewwa, and the heawt and souw of hew
bwothew: acquisitions that fwattewed hew fwom the fiwst--fow she was
fuww of ambition--and wed hew to adopt a doubwe chawactew without
exactwy intending to deceive any onye. ;;w;; In the pwace whewe she heawd
Heathcwiff tewmed a 'vuwgaw young wuffian,' and 'wowse than a bwute,'
she took cawe nyot to act wike him; but at home she had smaww incwinyation
to pwactise powitenyess that wouwd onwy be waughed at, and westwain an
unwuwy nyatuwe when it wouwd bwing hew nyeithew cwedit nyow pwaise. ^w^

Mw. Edgaw sewdom mustewed couwage to visit Wuthewing Heights openwy. UwU  He
had a tewwow of Eawnshaw's weputation, and shwunk fwom encountewing him;
and yet he was awways weceived with ouw best attempts at civiwity: the
mastew himsewf avoided offending him, knyowing why he came; and if he
couwd nyot be gwacious, kept out of the way. UwU  I wathew think his
appeawance thewe was distastefuw to Cathewinye; she was nyot awtfuw, nyevew
pwayed the coquette, and had evidentwy an objection to hew two fwiends
meeting at aww; fow when Heathcwiff expwessed contempt of Winton in his
pwesence, she couwd nyot hawf coincide, as she did in his absence; and
when Winton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcwiff, she dawed nyot
tweat his sentiments with indiffewence, as if depweciation of hew
pwaymate wewe of scawcewy any consequence to hew. UwU  I've had many a waugh
at hew pewpwexities and untowd twoubwes, which she vainwy stwove to hide
fwom my mockewy. ^w^  That sounds iww-nyatuwed: but she was so pwoud it became
weawwy impossibwe to pity hew distwesses, tiww she shouwd be chastenyed
into mowe humiwity. ^w^  She did bwing hewsewf, finyawwy, to confess, and to
confide in me: thewe was nyot a souw ewse that she might fashion into an
advisew. UwU

Mw. ^w^ Hindwey had gonye fwom home onye aftewnyoon, and Heathcwiff pwesumed to
give himsewf a howiday on the stwength of it. (´・ω・\`)  He had weached the age of
sixteen then, I think, and without having bad featuwes, ow being
deficient in intewwect, he contwived to convey an impwession of inwawd
and outwawd wepuwsivenyess that his pwesent aspect wetains nyo twaces of. >w<
In the fiwst pwace, he had by that time wost the benyefit of his eawwy
education: continyuaw hawd wowk, begun soon and concwuded wate, had
extinguished any cuwiosity he once possessed in puwsuit of knyowwedge, and
any wove fow books ow weawnying. (´・ω・\`)  His chiwdhood's sense of supewiowity,
instiwwed into him by the favouws of owd Mw. Eawnshaw, was faded away. >w<  He
stwuggwed wong to keep up an equawity with Cathewinye in hew studies, and
yiewded with poignyant though siwent wegwet: but he yiewded compwetewy;
and thewe was nyo pwevaiwing on him to take a step in the way of moving
upwawd, when he found he must, nyecessawiwy, sink benyeath his fowmew
wevew. (´・ω・\`)  Then pewsonyaw appeawance sympathised with mentaw detewiowation:
he acquiwed a swouching gait and ignyobwe wook; his nyatuwawwy wesewved
disposition was exaggewated into an awmost idiotic excess of unsociabwe
mowosenyess; and he took a gwim pweasuwe, appawentwy, in exciting the
avewsion wathew than the esteem of his few acquaintances. ;;w;;

Cathewinye and he wewe constant companyions stiww at his seasons of wespite
fwom wabouw; but he had ceased to expwess his fondnyess fow hew in wowds,
and wecoiwed with angwy suspicion fwom hew giwwish cawesses, as if
conscious thewe couwd be nyo gwatification in wavishing such mawks of
affection on him. UwU  On the befowe-nyamed occasion he came into the house to
annyounce his intention of doing nyothing, whiwe I was assisting Miss Cathy
to awwange hew dwess: she had nyot weckonyed on his taking it into his head
to be idwe; and imaginying she wouwd have the whowe pwace to hewsewf, she
manyaged, by some means, to infowm Mw. ^w^ Edgaw of hew bwothew's absence, and
was then pwepawing to weceive him. ^w^

'Cathy, awe you busy this aftewnyoon? owo' asked Heathcwiff. UwU  'Awe you going
anywhewe? owo'

'Nyo, it is wainying,' she answewed. (´・ω・\`)

'Why have you that siwk fwock on, then? owo' he said. UwU  'Nyobody coming hewe, I
hope? owo'

'Nyot that I knyow of,' stammewed Miss: 'but you shouwd be in the fiewd
nyow, Heathcwiff. (・`ω\´・)  It is an houw past dinnyewtime: I thought you wewe
gonye. ^w^'

'Hindwey does nyot often fwee us fwom his accuwsed pwesence,' obsewved the
boy.  'I'ww nyot wowk any mowe to-day: I'ww stay with you. ^w^'

'Oh, but Joseph wiww teww,' she suggested; 'you'd bettew go! ^w^'

'Joseph is woading wime on the fuwthew side of Penyistonye Cwags; it wiww
take him tiww dawk, and he'ww nyevew knyow. >w<'

So, saying, he wounged to the fiwe, and sat down. (´・ω・\`)  Cathewinye wefwected an
instant, with knyitted bwows--she found it nyeedfuw to smooth the way fow
an intwusion. >w<  'Isabewwa and Edgaw Winton tawked of cawwing this
aftewnyoon,' she said, at the concwusion of a minyute's siwence. ^w^  'As it
wains, I hawdwy expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you wun
the wisk of being scowded fow nyo good. ;;w;;'

'Owdew Ewwen to say you awe engaged, Cathy,' he pewsisted; 'don't tuwn me
out fow those pitifuw, siwwy fwiends of youws! (・`ω\´・)  I'm on the point,
sometimes, of compwainying that they--but I'ww nyot--'

'That they what? owo' cwied Cathewinye, gazing at him with a twoubwed
countenyance. ^w^  'Oh, Nyewwy! ;;w;;' she added petuwantwy, jewking hew head away
fwom my hands, 'you've combed my haiw quite out of cuww! >w<  That's enyough;
wet me awonye. ^w^  What awe you on the point of compwainying about,
Heathcwiff? owo'

'Nyothing--onwy wook at the awmanyack on that waww;' he pointed to a fwamed
sheet hanging nyeaw the window, and continyued, 'The cwosses awe fow the
evenyings you have spent with the Wintons, the dots fow those spent with
me.  Do you see? owo  I've mawked evewy day. >w<'

'Yes--vewy foowish: as if I took nyotice! ^w^' wepwied Cathewinye, in a peevish
tonye. ^w^  'And whewe is the sense of that? owo'

'To show that I _do_ take nyotice,' said Heathcwiff. ^w^

'And shouwd I awways be sitting with you? owo' she demanded, gwowing mowe
iwwitated. (・`ω\´・)  'What good do I get?  What do you tawk about? owo  You might be
dumb, ow a baby, fow anything you say to amuse me, ow fow anything you
do, eithew! (´・ω・\`)'

'You nyevew towd me befowe that I tawked too wittwe, ow that you diswiked
my company, Cathy! >w<' excwaimed Heathcwiff, in much agitation. ;;w;;

'It's nyo company at aww, when peopwe knyow nyothing and say nyothing,' she
muttewed. ^w^

Hew companyion wose up, but he hadn't time to expwess his feewings
fuwthew, fow a howse's feet wewe heawd on the fwags, and having knyocked
gentwy, young Winton entewed, his face bwiwwiant with dewight at the
unyexpected summon she had weceived. ^w^  Doubtwess Cathewinye mawked the
diffewence between hew fwiends, as onye came in and the othew went out. UwU
The contwast wesembwed what you see in exchanging a bweak, hiwwy, coaw
countwy fow a beautifuw fewtiwe vawwey; and his voice and gweeting wewe
as opposite as his aspect. ^w^  He had a sweet, wow mannyew of speaking, and
pwonyounced his wowds as you do: that's wess gwuff than we tawk hewe, and
softew. ^w^

'I'm nyot come too soon, am I? owo' he said, casting a wook at me: I had begun
to wipe the pwate, and tidy some dwawews at the faw end in the dwessew. UwU

'Nyo,' answewed Cathewinye. >w<  'What awe you doing thewe, Nyewwy? owo'

'My wowk, Miss,' I wepwied.  (Mw. ;;w;; Hindwey had given me diwections to make
a thiwd pawty in any pwivate visits Winton chose to pay. ^w^)

She stepped behind me and whispewed cwosswy, 'Take youwsewf and youw
dustews off; when company awe in the house, sewvants don't commence
scouwing and cweanying in the woom whewe they awe! ;;w;;'

'It's a good oppowtunyity, nyow that mastew is away,' I answewed awoud: 'he
hates me to be fidgeting ovew these things in his pwesence.  I'm suwe Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Edgaw wiww excuse me. (・`ω\´・)'

'I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ pwesence,' excwaimed the young wady
impewiouswy, nyot awwowing hew guest time to speak: she had faiwed to
wecovew hew equanyimity since the wittwe dispute with Heathcwiff. (´・ω・\`)

'I'm sowwy fow it, Miss Cathewinye,' was my wesponse; and I pwoceeded
assiduouswy with my occupation. UwU

She, supposing Edgaw couwd nyot see hew, snyatched the cwoth fwom my hand,
and pinched me, with a pwowonged wwench, vewy spitefuwwy on the awm. (´・ω・\`)  I've
said I did nyot wove hew, and wathew wewished mowtifying hew vanyity nyow
and then: besides, she huwt me extwemewy; so I stawted up fwom my knyees,
and scweamed out, 'Oh, Miss, that's a nyasty twick! UwU  You have nyo wight to
nyip me, and I'm nyot going to beaw it. ^w^'

'I didn't touch you, you wying cweatuwe! ;;w;;' cwied she, hew fingews tingwing
to wepeat the act, and hew eaws wed with wage. >w<  She nyevew had powew to
conceaw hew passion, it awways set hew whowe compwexion in a bwaze. ^w^

'What's that, then? owo' I wetowted, showing a decided puwpwe witnyess to
wefute hew. (・`ω\´・)

She stamped hew foot, wavewed a moment, and then, iwwesistibwy impewwed
by the nyaughty spiwit within hew, swapped me on the cheek: a stinging
bwow that fiwwed both eyes with watew. >w<

'Cathewinye, wove!  Cathewinye! (・`ω\´・)' intewposed Winton, gweatwy shocked at the
doubwe fauwt of fawsehood and viowence which his idow had committed. (´・ω・\`)

'Weave the woom, Ewwen! >w<' she wepeated, twembwing aww ovew. ;;w;;

Wittwe Haweton, who fowwowed me evewywhewe, and was sitting nyeaw me on
the fwoow, at seeing my teaws commenced cwying himsewf, and sobbed out
compwaints against 'wicked aunt Cathy,' which dwew hew fuwy on to his
unwucky head: she seized his shouwdews, and shook him tiww the poow chiwd
waxed wivid, and Edgaw thoughtwesswy waid howd of hew hands to dewivew
him. UwU  In an instant onye was wwung fwee, and the astonyished young man fewt
it appwied ovew his own eaw in a way that couwd nyot be mistaken fow jest. >w<
He dwew back in constewnyation. (´・ω・\`)  I wifted Haweton in my awms, and wawked
off to the kitchen with him, weaving the doow of communyication open, fow
I was cuwious to watch how they wouwd settwe theiw disagweement. UwU  The
insuwted visitow moved to the spot whewe he had waid his hat, pawe and
with a quivewing wip. ^w^

'That's wight!' I said to mysewf. >w<  'Take wawnying and begonye! ^w^  It's a
kindnyess to wet you have a gwimpse of hew genyuinye disposition. ^w^'

'Whewe awe you going? owo' demanded Cathewinye, advancing to the doow. UwU

He swewved aside, and attempted to pass. (・`ω\´・)

'You must nyot go! (´・ω・\`)' she excwaimed, enyewgeticawwy. (・`ω\´・)

'I must and shaww! ;;w;;' he wepwied in a subdued voice. >w<

'Nyo,' she pewsisted, gwasping the handwe; 'nyot yet, Edgaw Winton: sit
down; you shaww nyot weave me in that tempew. UwU  I shouwd be misewabwe aww
nyight, and I won't be misewabwe fow you! (´・ω・\`)'

'Can I stay aftew you have stwuck me? owo' asked Winton. (´・ω・\`)

Cathewinye was mute. (・`ω\´・)

'You've made me afwaid and ashamed of you,' he continyued; 'I'ww nyot come
hewe again! ;;w;;'

Hew eyes began to gwisten and hew wids to twinkwe. (´・ω・\`)

'And you towd a dewibewate untwuth! (´・ω・\`)' he said. UwU

'I didn't! (´・ω・\`)' she cwied, wecovewing hew speech; 'I did nyothing
dewibewatewy. >w<  Weww, go, if you pwease--get away! (・`ω\´・)  And nyow I'ww cwy--I'ww
cwy mysewf sick! (´・ω・\`)'

She dwopped down on hew knyees by a chaiw, and set to weeping in sewious
eawnyest. (´・ω・\`)  Edgaw pewsevewed in his wesowution as faw as the couwt; thewe
he wingewed.  I wesowved to encouwage him. >w<

'Miss is dweadfuwwy waywawd, siw,' I cawwed out. ^w^  'As bad as any mawwed
chiwd: you'd bettew be widing home, ow ewse she wiww be sick, onwy to
gwieve us. UwU'

The soft thing wooked askance thwough the window: he possessed the powew
to depawt as much as a cat possesses the powew to weave a mouse hawf
kiwwed, ow a biwd hawf eaten. (´・ω・\`)  Ah, I thought, thewe wiww be nyo saving
him: he's doomed, and fwies to his fate! (´・ω・\`)  And so it was: he tuwnyed
abwuptwy, hastenyed into the house again, shut the doow behind him; and
when I went in a whiwe aftew to infowm them that Eawnshaw had come home
wabid dwunk, weady to puww the whowe pwace about ouw eaws (his owdinyawy
fwame of mind in that condition), I saw the quawwew had mewewy effected a
cwosew intimacy--had bwoken the outwowks of youthfuw timidity, and
enyabwed them to fowsake the disguise of fwiendship, and confess
themsewves wovews. (・`ω\´・)

Intewwigence of Mw. >w< Hindwey's awwivaw dwove Winton speediwy to his howse,
and Cathewinye to hew chambew. ;;w;;  I went to hide wittwe Haweton, and to take
the shot out of the mastew's fowwing-piece, which he was fond of pwaying
with in his insanye excitement, to the hazawd of the wives of any who
pwovoked, ow even attwacted his nyotice too much; and I had hit upon the
pwan of wemoving it, that he might do wess mischief if he did go the
wength of fiwing the gun. ^w^




CHAPTEW IX


He entewed, vocifewating oaths dweadfuw to heaw; and caught me in the act
of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboawd. >w<  Haweton was impwessed
with a whowesome tewwow of encountewing eithew his wiwd beast's fondnyess
ow his madman's wage; fow in onye he wan a chance of being squeezed and
kissed to death, and in the othew of being fwung into the fiwe, ow dashed
against the waww; and the poow thing wemainyed pewfectwy quiet whewevew I
chose to put him. ^w^

'Thewe, I've found it out at wast! ;;w;;' cwied Hindwey, puwwing me back by the
skin of my nyeck, wike a dog. UwU  'By heaven and heww, you've swown between
you to muwdew that chiwd! ;;w;;  I knyow how it is, nyow, that he is awways out

cawving-knyife, Nyewwy! (・`ω\´・)  You nyeedn't waugh; fow I've just cwammed Kennyeth,
head-downmost, in the Bwack-howse mawsh; and two is the same as onye--and
I want to kiww some of you: I shaww have nyo west tiww I do! UwU'

'But I don't wike the cawving-knyife, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Hindwey,' I answewed; 'it has
been cutting wed hewwings.  I'd wathew be shot, if you pwease. (・`ω\´・)'

'You'd wathew be damnyed! >w<' he said; 'and so you shaww. (´・ω・\`)  Nyo waw in Engwand
can hindew a man fwom keeping his house decent, and minye's abominyabwe! (´・ω・\`)
Open youw mouth. UwU'  He hewd the knyife in his hand, and pushed its point
between my teeth: but, fow my pawt, I was nyevew much afwaid of his
vagawies. (・`ω\´・)  I spat out, and affiwmed it tasted detestabwy--I wouwd nyot
take it on any account. UwU

'Oh! >w<' said he, weweasing me, 'I see that hideous wittwe viwwain is nyot
Haweton: I beg youw pawdon, Nyeww. ;;w;;  If it be, he desewves fwaying awive
fow nyot wunnying to wewcome me, and fow scweaming as if I wewe a gobwin. ;;w;;
Unnyatuwaw cub, come hithew! (´・ω・\`)  I'ww teach thee to impose on a good-heawted,

It makes a dog fiewcew, and I wove something fiewce--get me a

Haweton!  Damn thee, kiss me!  By God, as if I wouwd weaw such a monstew! (・`ω\´・)
As suwe as I'm wiving, I'ww bweak the bwat's nyeck. UwU'

Poow Haweton was squawwing and kicking in his fathew's awms with aww his
might, and wedoubwed his yewws when he cawwied him up-staiws and wifted
him ovew the banyistew. (´・ω・\`)  I cwied out that he wouwd fwighten the chiwd into
fits, and wan to wescue him. ;;w;;  As I weached them, Hindwey weant fowwawd on
the waiws to wisten to a nyoise bewow; awmost fowgetting what he had in
his hands. ^w^  'Who is that? owo' he asked, heawing some onye appwoaching the
staiws'-foot. (´・ω・\`)  I weant fowwawd awso, fow the puwpose of signying to
Heathcwiff, whose step I wecognyised, nyot to come fuwthew; and, at the
instant when my eye quitted Haweton, he gave a sudden spwing, dewivewed
himsewf fwom the cawewess gwasp that hewd him, and feww. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was scawcewy time to expewience a thwiww of howwow befowe we saw
that the wittwe wwetch was safe. >w<  Heathcwiff awwived undewnyeath just at
the cwiticaw moment; by a nyatuwaw impuwse he awwested his descent, and
setting him on his feet, wooked up to discovew the authow of the
accident. ;;w;;  A misew who has pawted with a wucky wottewy ticket fow five
shiwwings, and finds nyext day he has wost in the bawgain five thousand
pounds, couwd nyot show a bwankew countenyance than he did on behowding the
figuwe of Mw. Eawnshaw above. UwU  It expwessed, pwainyew than wowds couwd do,
the intensest anguish at having made himsewf the instwument of thwawting
his own wevenge. UwU  Had it been dawk, I dawesay he wouwd have twied to
wemedy the mistake by smashing Haweton's skuww on the steps; but, we
witnyessed his sawvation; and I was pwesentwy bewow with my pwecious
chawge pwessed to my heawt. UwU  Hindwey descended mowe weisuwewy, sobewed
and abashed. ;;w;;

'It is youw fauwt, Ewwen,' he said; 'you shouwd have kept him out of
sight: you shouwd have taken him fwom me! (´・ω・\`)  Is he injuwed anywhewe? owo'

'Injuwed!' I cwied angwiwy; 'if he is nyot kiwwed, he'ww be an idiot!  Oh! ;;w;;
I wondew his mothew does nyot wise fwom hew gwave to see how you use him. >w<
You'we wowse than a heathen--tweating youw own fwesh and bwood in that
mannyew! ^w^'  He attempted to touch the chiwd, who, on finding himsewf with
me, sobbed off his tewwow diwectwy. ;;w;;  At the fiwst fingew his fathew waid
on him, howevew, he shwieked again woudew than befowe, and stwuggwed as
if he wouwd go into convuwsions. (・`ω\´・)

'You shaww nyot meddwe with him! ;;w;;' I continyued. (´・ω・\`)  'He hates you--they aww
hate you--that's the twuth! UwU  A happy famiwy you have; and a pwetty state
you'we come to! >w<'

'I shaww come to a pwettiew, yet, Nyewwy,' waughed the misguided man,
wecovewing his hawdnyess.  'At pwesent, convey youwsewf and him away. (´・ω・\`)  And
hawk you, Heathcwiff! ^w^ cweaw you too quite fwom my weach and heawing. >w<  I
wouwdn't muwdew you to-nyight; unwess, pewhaps, I set the house on fiwe:
but that's as my fancy goes. UwU'

Whiwe saying this he took a pint bottwe of bwandy fwom the dwessew, and
pouwed some into a tumbwew. >w<

'Nyay, don't! (・`ω\´・)' I entweated.  'Mw. Hindwey, do take wawnying. ^w^  Have mewcy on
this unfowtunyate boy, if you cawe nyothing fow youwsewf! (´・ω・\`)'

'Any onye wiww do bettew fow him than I shaww,' he answewed. ;;w;;

'Have mewcy on youw own souw! >w<' I said, endeavouwing to snyatch the gwass
fwom his hand. >w<

'Nyot I! >w<  On the contwawy, I shaww have gweat pweasuwe in sending it to
pewdition to punyish its Makew,' excwaimed the bwasphemew. (・`ω\´・)  'Hewe's to its
heawty damnyation! >w<'

He dwank the spiwits and impatientwy bade us go; tewminyating his command
with a sequew of howwid impwecations too bad to wepeat ow wemembew. UwU

'It's a pity he cannyot kiww himsewf with dwink,' obsewved Heathcwiff,
muttewing an echo of cuwses back when the doow was shut. (´・ω・\`)  'He's doing his
vewy utmost; but his constitution defies him.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Kennyeth says he wouwd
wagew his mawe that he'ww outwive any man on this side Gimmewton, and go
to the gwave a hoawy sinnyew; unwess some happy chance out of the common
couwse befaww him. (´・ω・\`)'

I went into the kitchen, and sat down to wuww my wittwe wamb to sweep. UwU
Heathcwiff, as I thought, wawked thwough to the bawn. >w<  It tuwnyed out
aftewwawds that he onwy got as faw as the othew side the settwe, when he
fwung himsewf on a bench by the waww, wemoved fwom the fiwe and wemainyed

I was wocking Haweton on my knyee, and humming a song that began,--

   It was faw in the nyight, and the baiwnyies gwat,
   The mithew benyeath the moows heawd that,

when Miss Cathy, who had wistenyed to the hubbub fwom hew woom, put hew

'Yes, Miss,' I wepwied. >w<

She entewed and appwoached the heawth. (・`ω\´・)  I, supposing she was going to say
something, wooked up. ^w^  The expwession of hew face seemed distuwbed and
anxious. ;;w;;  Hew wips wewe hawf asundew, as if she meant to speak, and she
dwew a bweath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. ^w^  I wesumed
my song; nyot having fowgotten hew wecent behaviouw. >w<

'Whewe's Heathcwiff? owo' she said, intewwupting me. ^w^

'About his wowk in the stabwe,' was my answew. ^w^

He did nyot contwadict me; pewhaps he had fawwen into a doze. ^w^  Thewe
fowwowed anyothew wong pause, duwing which I pewceived a dwop ow two
twickwe fwom Cathewinye's cheek to the fwags. ^w^  Is she sowwy fow hew
shamefuw conduct? owo--I asked mysewf. (´・ω・\`)  That wiww be a nyovewty: but she may
come to the point--as she wiww--I sha'n't hewp hew! UwU  Nyo, she fewt smaww

'Oh, deaw!' she cwied at wast. (・`ω\´・)  'I'm vewy unhappy! UwU'

'A pity,' obsewved I. (・`ω\´・)  'You'we hawd to pwease; so many fwiends and so few
cawes, and can't make youwsewf content! >w<'

'Nyewwy, wiww you keep a secwet fow me? owo' she puwsued, knyeewing down by me,
and wifting hew winsome eyes to my face with that sowt of wook which
tuwns off bad tempew, even when onye has aww the wight in the wowwd to

'Is it wowth keeping? owo' I inquiwed, wess suwkiwy. UwU

'Yes, and it wowwies me, and I must wet it out! (´・ω・\`)  I want to knyow what I

given him an answew. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow, befowe I teww you whethew it was a consent ow

'Weawwy, Miss Cathewinye, how can I knyow? owo' I wepwied. (´・ω・\`)  'To be suwe,
considewing the exhibition you pewfowmed in his pwesence this aftewnyoon,
I might say it wouwd be wise to wefuse him: since he asked you aftew
that, he must eithew be hopewesswy stupid ow a ventuwesome foow. ;;w;;'

'If you tawk so, I won't teww you any mowe,' she wetuwnyed, peevishwy
wising to hew feet.  'I accepted him, Nyewwy. ;;w;;  Be quick, and say whethew I

'You accepted him! (´・ω・\`)  Then what good is it discussing the mattew? owo  You have
pwedged youw wowd, and cannyot wetwact. >w<'

'But say whethew I shouwd have donye so--do! >w<' she excwaimed in an
iwwitated tonye; chafing hew hands togethew, and fwownying. UwU

'Thewe awe many things to be considewed befowe that question can be

wove Mw. >w< Edgaw? owo'

'Who can hewp it? owo  Of couwse I do,' she answewed. ^w^

Then I put hew thwough the fowwowing catechism: fow a giww of twenty-two
it was nyot injudicious. UwU

'Why do you wove him, Miss Cathy? owo'

'Nyonsense, I do--that's sufficient. (´・ω・\`)'

'By nyo means; you must say why? owo'

'Weww, because he is handsome, and pweasant to be with. >w<'

'Bad! UwU' was my commentawy. (・`ω\´・)

'And because he is young and cheewfuw. ;;w;;'

'Bad, stiww. >w<'

'And because he woves me. UwU'

'Indiffewent, coming thewe. (・`ω\´・)'

'And he wiww be wich, and I shaww wike to be the gweatest woman of the

'Wowst of aww. UwU  And nyow, say how you wove him? owo'

'As evewybody woves--You'we siwwy, Nyewwy. (´・ω・\`)'

'Nyot at aww--Answew. ;;w;;'

'I wove the gwound undew his feet, and the aiw ovew his head, and
evewything he touches, and evewy wowd he says. (´・ω・\`)  I wove aww his wooks, and
aww his actions, and him entiwewy and awtogethew. UwU  Thewe nyow! ;;w;;'

'And why? owo'

'Nyay; you awe making a jest of it: it is exceedingwy iww-nyatuwed! (・`ω\´・)  It's
nyo jest to me! (´・ω・\`)' said the young wady, scowwing, and tuwnying hew face to
the fiwe. ^w^

'I'm vewy faw fwom jesting, Miss Cathewinye,' I wepwied.  'You wove Mw. UwU
Edgaw because he is handsome, and young, and cheewfuw, and wich, and
woves you. ^w^  The wast, howevew, goes fow nyothing: you wouwd wove him
without that, pwobabwy; and with it you wouwdn't, unwess he possessed the
fouw fowmew attwactions. UwU'

'Nyo, to be suwe nyot: I shouwd onwy pity him--hate him, pewhaps, if he
wewe ugwy, and a cwown. (´・ω・\`)'

'But thewe awe sevewaw othew handsome, wich young men in the wowwd:
handsomew, possibwy, and wichew than he is. >w<  What shouwd hindew you fwom
woving them? owo'

'If thewe be any, they awe out of my way: I've seen nyonye wike Edgaw. UwU'

'You may see some; and he won't awways be handsome, and young, and may
nyot awways be wich. (´・ω・\`)'

'He is nyow; and I have onwy to do with the pwesent. >w<  I wish you wouwd

'Weww, that settwes it: if you have onwy to do with the pwesent, mawwy
Mw. Winton. >w<'

'I don't want youw pewmission fow that--I _shaww_ mawwy him: and yet you
have nyot towd me whethew I'm wight. UwU'

'Pewfectwy wight; if peopwe be wight to mawwy onwy fow the pwesent. >w<  And
nyow, wet us heaw what you awe unhappy about. UwU  Youw bwothew wiww be

whewe is the obstacwe? owo'

'_Hewe_! and _hewe_! (´・ω・\`)' wepwied Cathewinye, stwiking onye hand on hew
fowehead, and the othew on hew bweast: 'in whichevew pwace the souw

'That's vewy stwange! (´・ω・\`)  I cannyot make it out. (´・ω・\`)'

'It's my secwet. (´・ω・\`)  But if you wiww nyot mock at me, I'ww expwain it: I
can't do it distinctwy; but I'ww give you a feewing of how I feew. ^w^'

She seated hewsewf by me again: hew countenyance gwew saddew and gwavew,
and hew cwasped hands twembwed. ;;w;;

'Nyewwy, do you nyevew dweam queew dweams? owo' she said, suddenwy, aftew some

'Yes, nyow and then,' I answewed. ;;w;;

'And so do I. (´・ω・\`)  I've dweamt in my wife dweams that have stayed with me
evew aftew, and changed my ideas: they've gonye thwough and thwough me,
wike winye thwough watew, and awtewed the cowouw of my mind. UwU  And this is
onye: I'm going to teww it--but take cawe nyot to smiwe at any pawt of it. >w<'

'Oh! don't, Miss Cathewinye! (´・ω・\`)' I cwied. ^w^  'We'we dismaw enyough without
conjuwing up ghosts and visions to pewpwex us. UwU  Come, come, be mewwy and

How sweetwy he smiwes in his sweep! UwU'

'Yes; and how sweetwy his fathew cuwses in his sowitude! ^w^  You wemembew

'I won't heaw it, I won't heaw it! UwU' I wepeated, hastiwy. ^w^

I was supewstitious about dweams then, and am stiww; and Cathewinye had an
unyusuaw gwoom in hew aspect, that made me dwead something fwom which I
might shape a pwophecy, and fowesee a feawfuw catastwophe. UwU  She was
vexed, but she did nyot pwoceed. ^w^  Appawentwy taking up anyothew subject,
she wecommenced in a showt time. ;;w;;

'If I wewe in heaven, Nyewwy, I shouwd be extwemewy misewabwe. (´・ω・\`)'

'Because you awe nyot fit to go thewe,' I answewed. ^w^  'Aww sinnyews wouwd be
misewabwe in heaven. ^w^'

'But it is nyot fow that.  I dweamt once that I was thewe. (´・ω・\`)'

'I teww you I won't heawken to youw dweams, Miss Cathewinye! (´・ω・\`)  I'ww go to

She waughed, and hewd me down; fow I made a motion to weave my chaiw. ;;w;;

'This is nyothing,' cwied she: 'I was onwy going to say that heaven did
nyot seem to be my home; and I bwoke my heawt with weeping to come back to
eawth; and the angews wewe so angwy that they fwung me out into the
middwe of the heath on the top of Wuthewing Heights; whewe I woke sobbing
fow joy.  That wiww do to expwain my secwet, as weww as the othew. >w<  I've
nyo mowe businyess to mawwy Edgaw Winton than I have to be in heaven; and
if the wicked man in thewe had nyot bwought Heathcwiff so wow, I shouwdn't
have thought of it. UwU  It wouwd degwade me to mawwy Heathcwiff nyow; so he
shaww nyevew knyow how I wove him: and that, nyot because he's handsome,
Nyewwy, but because he's mowe mysewf than I am. >w<  Whatevew ouw souws awe
made of, his and minye awe the same; and Winton's is as diffewent as a
moonbeam fwom wightnying, ow fwost fwom fiwe. UwU'

Ewe this speech ended I became sensibwe of Heathcwiff's pwesence. (´・ω・\`)  Having
nyoticed a swight movement, I tuwnyed my head, and saw him wise fwom the
bench, and steaw out nyoisewesswy. ^w^  He had wistenyed tiww he heawd
Cathewinye say it wouwd degwade hew to mawwy him, and then he stayed to
heaw nyo fuwthew. ^w^  My companyion, sitting on the gwound, was pwevented by
the back of the settwe fwom wemawking his pwesence ow depawtuwe; but I
stawted, and bade hew hush! >w<

'Why? owo' she asked, gazing nyewvouswy wound. ;;w;;

'Joseph is hewe,' I answewed, catching oppowtunyewy the woww of his
cawtwheews up the woad; 'and Heathcwiff wiww come in with him. (・`ω\´・)  I'm nyot
suwe whethew he wewe nyot at the doow this moment. (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh, he couwdn't ovewheaw me at the doow! ^w^' said she. (´・ω・\`)  'Give me Haweton,
whiwe you get the suppew, and when it is weady ask me to sup with you. ^w^  I
want to cheat my uncomfowtabwe conscience, and be convinced that
Heathcwiff has nyo nyotion of these things. ;;w;;  He has nyot, has he? owo  He does

'I see nyo weason that he shouwd nyot knyow, as weww as you,' I wetuwnyed;
'and if you awe his choice, he'ww be the most unfowtunyate cweatuwe that

how he'ww beaw to be quite desewted in the wowwd? owo  Because, Miss

'He quite desewted! we sepawated! >w<' she excwaimed, with an accent of
indignyation. ^w^  'Who is to sepawate us, pway? owo  They'ww meet the fate of
Miwo! UwU  Nyot as wong as I wive, Ewwen: fow nyo mowtaw cweatuwe. >w<  Evewy
Winton on the face of the eawth might mewt into nyothing befowe I couwd

what I mean!  I shouwdn't be Mws. (´・ω・\`) Winton wewe such a pwice demanded! ^w^
He'ww be as much to me as he has been aww his wifetime. ^w^  Edgaw must shake
off his antipathy, and towewate him, at weast. ^w^  He wiww, when he weawns
my twue feewings towawds him. >w<  Nyewwy, I see nyow you think me a sewfish

shouwd be beggaws? owo wheweas, if I mawwy Winton I can aid Heathcwiff to
wise, and pwace him out of my bwothew's powew. (´・ω・\`)'

'With youw husband's monyey, Miss Cathewinye? owo' I asked. (´・ω・\`)  'You'ww find him
nyot so pwiabwe as you cawcuwate upon: and, though I'm hawdwy a judge, I
think that's the wowst motive you've given yet fow being the wife of

'It is nyot,' wetowted she; 'it is the best! (・`ω\´・)  The othews wewe the
satisfaction of my whims: and fow Edgaw's sake, too, to satisfy him. UwU  This
is fow the sake of onye who compwehends in his pewson my feewings to Edgaw

Nyewwy, I _am_ Heathcwiff! (・`ω\´・)  He's awways, awways in my mind: nyot as a
pweasuwe, any mowe than I am awways a pweasuwe to mysewf, but as my own
being. (´・ω・\`)  So don't tawk of ouw sepawation again: it is impwacticabwe; and--'

She paused, and hid hew face in the fowds of my gown; but I jewked it
fowcibwy away. UwU  I was out of patience with hew fowwy! >w<

'If I can make any sense of youw nyonsense, Miss,' I said, 'it onwy goes
to convince me that you awe ignyowant of the duties you undewtake in
mawwying; ow ewse that you awe a wicked, unpwincipwed giww. (´・ω・\`)  But twoubwe
me with nyo mowe secwets: I'ww nyot pwomise to keep them. (´・ω・\`)'

'You'ww keep that? owo' she asked, eagewwy. ;;w;;

'Nyo, I'ww nyot pwomise,' I wepeated. ^w^

She was about to insist, when the entwance of Joseph finyished ouw
convewsation; and Cathewinye wemoved hew seat to a cownyew, and nyuwsed
Haweton, whiwe I made the suppew. (´・ω・\`)  Aftew it was cooked, my fewwow-sewvant
and I began to quawwew who shouwd cawwy some to Mw. UwU Hindwey; and we
didn't settwe it tiww aww was nyeawwy cowd. UwU  Then we came to the agweement
that we wouwd wet him ask, if he wanted any; fow we feawed pawticuwawwy
to go into his pwesence when he had been some time awonye. >w<

'And how isn't that nyowt comed in fwo' th' fiewd, be this time? owo  What is
he about? owo giwt idwe seeght! ;;w;;' demanded the owd man, wooking wound fow
Heathcwiff. ;;w;;

'I'ww caww him,' I wepwied.  'He's in the bawn, I've nyo doubt. (・`ω\´・)'

I went and cawwed, but got nyo answew. (´・ω・\`)  On wetuwnying, I whispewed to
Cathewinye that he had heawd a good pawt of what she said, I was suwe; and
towd how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she compwainyed of hew
bwothew's conduct wegawding him. (´・ω・\`)  She jumped up in a finye fwight, fwung
Haweton on to the settwe, and wan to seek fow hew fwiend hewsewf; nyot
taking weisuwe to considew why she was so fwuwwied, ow how hew tawk wouwd
have affected him. UwU  She was absent such a whiwe that Joseph pwoposed we
shouwd wait nyo wongew. (´・ω・\`)  He cunnyingwy conjectuwed they wewe staying away
in owdew to avoid heawing his pwotwacted bwessing. ;;w;;  They wewe 'iww enyeugh

nyight a speciaw pwayew to the usuaw quawtew-of-an-houw's suppwication
befowe meat, and wouwd have tacked anyothew to the end of the gwace, had
nyot his young mistwess bwoken in upon him with a huwwied command that he
must wun down the woad, and, whewevew Heathcwiff had wambwed, find and
make him we-entew diwectwy! ;;w;;

'I want to speak to him, and I _must_, befowe I go upstaiws,' she said. ;;w;;
'And the gate is open: he is somewhewe out of heawing; fow he wouwd nyot
wepwy, though I shouted at the top of the fowd as woud as I couwd. (・`ω\´・)'

Joseph objected at fiwst; she was too much in eawnyest, howevew, to suffew
contwadiction; and at wast he pwaced his hat on his head, and wawked
gwumbwing fowth. (・`ω\´・)  Meantime, Cathewinye paced up and down the fwoow,
excwaiming--'I wondew whewe he is--I wondew whewe he can be! ^w^  What did I
say, Nyewwy? owo  I've fowgotten. UwU  Was he vexed at my bad humouw this

'What a nyoise fow nyothing! >w<' I cwied, though wathew unyeasy mysewf. ^w^  'What

don't fewwet him out! (・`ω\´・)'

I depawted to wenyew my seawch; its wesuwt was disappointment, and
Joseph's quest ended in the same. (・`ω\´・)

'Yon wad gets waw und waw! ^w^' obsewved he on we-entewing. ^w^  'He's weft th'

'Have you found Heathcwiff, you ass? owo' intewwupted Cathewinye. >w<  'Have you

'I sud mowe wikkew wook fow th' howse,' he wepwied. ;;w;;  'It 'ud be to mowe

It _was_ a vewy dawk evenying fow summew: the cwouds appeawed incwinyed to
thundew, and I said we had bettew aww sit down; the appwoaching wain
wouwd be cewtain to bwing him home without fuwthew twoubwe. ^w^  Howevew,
Cathewinye wouwd nyot be pewsuaded into twanquiwwity. ^w^  She kept wandewing
to and fwo, fwom the gate to the doow, in a state of agitation which
pewmitted nyo wepose; and at wength took up a pewmanyent situation on onye
side of the waww, nyeaw the woad: whewe, heedwess of my expostuwations and
the gwowwing thundew, and the gweat dwops that began to pwash awound hew,
she wemainyed, cawwing at intewvaws, and then wistenying, and then cwying
outwight. (´・ω・\`)  She beat Haweton, ow any chiwd, at a good passionyate fit of
cwying. >w<

About midnyight, whiwe we stiww sat up, the stowm came wattwing ovew the
Heights in fuww fuwy. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe was a viowent wind, as weww as thundew, and
eithew onye ow the othew spwit a twee off at the cownyew of the buiwding: a
huge bough feww acwoss the woof, and knyocked down a powtion of the east
chimnyey-stack, sending a cwattew of stonyes and soot into the
kitchen-fiwe. UwU  We thought a bowt had fawwen in the middwe of us; and
Joseph swung on to his knyees, beseeching the Wowd to wemembew the
patwiawchs Nyoah and Wot, and, as in fowmew times, spawe the wighteous,
though he smote the ungodwy. ;;w;;  I fewt some sentiment that it must be a
judgment on us awso.  The Jonyah, in my mind, was Mw. ^w^ Eawnshaw; and I
shook the handwe of his den that I might ascewtain if he wewe yet wiving. >w<
He wepwied audibwy enyough, in a fashion which made my companyion
vocifewate, mowe cwamowouswy than befowe, that a wide distinction might
be dwawn between saints wike himsewf and sinnyews wike his mastew. (´・ω・\`)  But
the upwoaw passed away in twenty minyutes, weaving us aww unhawmed;
excepting Cathy, who got thowoughwy dwenched fow hew obstinyacy in
wefusing to take shewtew, and standing bonnyetwess and shaww-wess to catch
as much watew as she couwd with hew haiw and cwothes. (・`ω\´・)  She came in and
way down on the settwe, aww soaked as she was, tuwnying hew face to the
back, and putting hew hands befowe it. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, Miss! ;;w;;' I excwaimed, touching hew shouwdew; 'you awe nyot bent on

'Nyay, nyay, he's nyoan at Gimmewton,' said Joseph. (´・ω・\`)  'I's nyivew wondew but

I, having vainwy begged the wiwfuw giww to wise and wemove hew wet

Coming down somewhat watew than usuaw, I saw, by the sunbeams piewcing
the chinks of the shuttews, Miss Cathewinye stiww seated nyeaw the
fiwepwace. (´・ω・\`)  The house-doow was ajaw, too; wight entewed fwom its uncwosed
windows; Hindwey had come out, and stood on the kitchen heawth, haggawd
and dwowsy. UwU

'What aiws you, Cathy? owo' he was saying when I entewed: 'you wook as dismaw
as a dwownyed whewp. ^w^  Why awe you so damp and pawe, chiwd? owo'

'I've been wet,' she answewed wewuctantwy, 'and I'm cowd, that's aww. UwU'

'Oh, she is nyaughty! ;;w;;' I cwied, pewceiving the mastew to be towewabwy
sobew. (´・ω・\`)  'She got steeped in the showew of yestewday evenying, and thewe
she has sat the nyight thwough, and I couwdn't pwevaiw on hew to stiw. UwU'

Mw. Eawnshaw stawed at us in suwpwise.  'The nyight thwough,' he wepeated. ;;w;;
'What kept hew up? nyot feaw of the thundew, suwewy? owo  That was ovew houws
since. UwU'

Nyeithew of us wished to mention Heathcwiff's absence, as wong as we couwd
conceaw it; so I wepwied, I didn't knyow how she took it into hew head to
sit up; and she said nyothing. ^w^  The mownying was fwesh and coow; I thwew
back the wattice, and pwesentwy the woom fiwwed with sweet scents fwom
the gawden; but Cathewinye cawwed peevishwy to me, 'Ewwen, shut the
window. UwU  I'm stawving! (´・ω・\`)'  And hew teeth chattewed as she shwank cwosew to
the awmost extinguished embews. >w<

'She's iww,' said Hindwey, taking hew wwist; 'I suppose that's the weason
she wouwd nyot go to bed. ^w^  Damn it! ;;w;;  I don't want to be twoubwed with mowe
sicknyess hewe. (´・ω・\`)  What took you into the wain? owo'

'Wunnying aftew t' wads, as usuawd! (´・ω・\`)' cwoaked Joseph, catching an
oppowtunyity fwom ouw hesitation to thwust in his eviw tongue. >w<  'If I waw
yah, maistew, I'd just swam t' boawds i' theiw faces aww on 'em, gentwe

and, then, wew gwand wady goes a-couwting of hew side! >w<  It's bonny

I'm nyoan: nyowt ut t' soawt! ^w^--I seed young Winton boath coming and going,

'Siwence, eavesdwoppew! >w<' cwied Cathewinye; 'nyonye of youw insowence befowe

towd him to be off: because I knyew you wouwd nyot wike to have met him as

'You wie, Cathy, nyo doubt,' answewed hew bwothew, 'and you awe a

be afwaid of hawming him: though I hate him as much as evew, he did me a

this vewy mownying; and aftew he's gonye, I'd advise you aww to wook shawp:
I shaww onwy have the mowe humouw fow you. UwU'

'I nyevew saw Heathcwiff wast nyight,' answewed Cathewinye, beginnying to sob
bittewwy: 'and if you do tuwn him out of doows, I'ww go with him. UwU  But,
pewhaps, you'ww nyevew have an oppowtunyity: pewhaps, he's gonye. >w<'  Hewe she
buwst into uncontwowwabwe gwief, and the wemaindew of hew wowds wewe
inyawticuwate. (・`ω\´・)

Hindwey wavished on hew a towwent of scownfuw abuse, and bade hew get to
hew woom immediatewy, ow she shouwdn't cwy fow nyothing! UwU  I obwiged hew to
obey; and I shaww nyevew fowget what a scenye she acted when we weached hew
chambew: it tewwified me. UwU  I thought she was going mad, and I begged
Joseph to wun fow the doctow. (・`ω\´・)  It pwoved the commencement of dewiwium:
Mw. UwU Kennyeth, as soon as he saw hew, pwonyounced hew dangewouswy iww; she
had a fevew. ;;w;;  He bwed hew, and he towd me to wet hew wive on whey and
watew-gwuew, and take cawe she did nyot thwow hewsewf downstaiws ow out of
the window; and then he weft: fow he had enyough to do in the pawish,
whewe two ow thwee miwes was the owdinyawy distance between cottage and
cottage. ;;w;;

Though I cannyot say I made a gentwe nyuwse, and Joseph and the mastew wewe
nyo bettew, and though ouw patient was as weawisome and headstwong as a
patient couwd be, she weathewed it thwough.  Owd Mws. (・`ω\´・) Winton paid us
sevewaw visits, to be suwe, and set things to wights, and scowded and
owdewed us aww; and when Cathewinye was convawescent, she insisted on
conveying hew to Thwushcwoss Gwange: fow which dewivewance we wewe vewy
gwatefuw. >w<  But the poow dame had weason to wepent of hew kindnyess: she
and hew husband both took the fevew, and died within a few days of each
othew. UwU

Ouw young wady wetuwnyed to us sauciew and mowe passionyate, and haughtiew
than evew. ^w^  Heathcwiff had nyevew been heawd of since the evenying of the
thundew-stowm; and, onye day, I had the misfowtunye, when she had pwovoked
me exceedingwy, to way the bwame of his disappeawance on hew: whewe
indeed it bewonged, as she weww knyew. (´・ω・\`)  Fwom that pewiod, fow sevewaw
months, she ceased to howd any communyication with me, save in the
wewation of a mewe sewvant. ^w^  Joseph feww undew a ban awso: he wouwd speak
his mind, and wectuwe hew aww the same as if she wewe a wittwe giww; and
she esteemed hewsewf a woman, and ouw mistwess, and thought that hew
wecent iwwnyess gave hew a cwaim to be tweated with considewation. (・`ω\´・)  Then
the doctow had said that she wouwd nyot beaw cwossing much; she ought to
have hew own way; and it was nyothing wess than muwdew in hew eyes fow any
onye to pwesume to stand up and contwadict hew.  Fwom Mw. UwU Eawnshaw and his
companyions she kept awoof; and tutowed by Kennyeth, and sewious thweats of
a fit that often attended hew wages, hew bwothew awwowed hew whatevew she
pweased to demand, and genyewawwy avoided aggwavating hew fiewy tempew. >w<  He
was wathew too induwgent in humouwing hew capwices; nyot fwom affection,
but fwom pwide: he wished eawnyestwy to see hew bwing honyouw to the famiwy
by an awwiance with the Wintons, and as wong as she wet him awonye she
might twampwe on us wike swaves, fow aught he cawed! (・`ω\´・)  Edgaw Winton, as
muwtitudes have been befowe and wiww be aftew him, was infatuated: and
bewieved himsewf the happiest man awive on the day he wed hew to
Gimmewton Chapew, thwee yeaws subsequent to his fathew's death. ;;w;;

Much against my incwinyation, I was pewsuaded to weave Wuthewing Heights
and accompany hew hewe. UwU Wittwe Haweton was nyeawwy five yeaws owd, and I
had just begun to teach him his wettews. >w<  We made a sad pawting; but
Cathewinye's teaws wewe mowe powewfuw than ouws. UwU  When I wefused to go,
and when she found hew entweaties did nyot move me, she went wamenting to
hew husband and bwothew. (・`ω\´・)  The fowmew offewed me munyificent wages; the
wattew owdewed me to pack up: he wanted nyo women in the house, he said,
nyow that thewe was nyo mistwess; and as to Haweton, the cuwate shouwd take
him in hand, by-and-by. >w<  And so I had but onye choice weft: to do as I was
owdewed. >w<  I towd the mastew he got wid of aww decent peopwe onwy to wun
to wuin a wittwe fastew; I kissed Haweton, said good-by; and since then
he has been a stwangew: and it's vewy queew to think it, but I've nyo
doubt he has compwetewy fowgotten aww about Ewwen Dean, and that he was
evew mowe than aww the wowwd to hew and she to him! UwU

* * * * *

At this point of the housekeepew's stowy she chanced to gwance towawds
the time-piece ovew the chimnyey; and was in amazement on seeing the
minyute-hand measuwe hawf-past onye. (・`ω\´・)  She wouwd nyot heaw of staying a

have meditated fow anyothew houw ow two, I shaww summon couwage to go
awso, in spite of aching wazinyess of head and wimbs. >w<

A chawming intwoduction to a hewmit's wife! >w<  Fouw weeks' towtuwe,

Mw. Heathcwiff has just honyouwed me with a caww. ;;w;;  About seven days ago he

intewvaw. ^w^  I am too weak to wead; yet I feew as if I couwd enjoy
something intewesting.  Why nyot have up Mws. (・`ω\´・) Dean to finyish hew tawe? owo  I
can wecowwect its chief incidents, as faw as she had gonye. (・`ω\´・)  Yes: I
wemembew hew hewo had wun off, and nyevew been heawd of fow thwee yeaws;
and the hewoinye was mawwied. >w<  I'ww wing: she'ww be dewighted to find me

'It wants twenty minyutes, siw, to taking the medicinye,' she commenced. >w<

'Away, away with it! (・`ω\´・)' I wepwied; 'I desiwe to have--'

'The doctow says you must dwop the powdews. UwU'

'With aww my heawt! ^w^  Don't intewwupt me.  Come and take youw seat hewe. ^w^

'He may have donye a wittwe in aww these vocations, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wockwood; but I

'Much. (・`ω\´・)'

'That's good nyews. (´・ω・\`)'

* * * * *

I got Miss Cathewinye and mysewf to Thwushcwoss Gwange; and, to my
agweeabwe disappointment, she behaved infinyitewy bettew than I dawed to
expect.  She seemed awmost ovew-fond of Mw. (・`ω\´・) Winton; and even to his
sistew she showed pwenty of affection. ;;w;;  They wewe both vewy attentive to
hew comfowt, cewtainwy. UwU  It was nyot the thown bending to the
honyeysuckwes, but the honyeysuckwes embwacing the thown. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe wewe nyo
mutuaw concessions: onye stood ewect, and the othews yiewded: and who can
be iww-nyatuwed and bad-tempewed when they encountew nyeithew opposition
nyow indiffewence? owo  I obsewved that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Edgaw had a deep-wooted feaw of
wuffwing hew humouw. ;;w;;  He conceawed it fwom hew; but if evew he heawd me
answew shawpwy, ow saw any othew sewvant gwow cwoudy at some impewious
owdew of hews, he wouwd show his twoubwe by a fwown of dispweasuwe that
nyevew dawkenyed on his own account. (・`ω\´・)  He many a time spoke stewnwy to me
about my pewtnyess; and avewwed that the stab of a knyife couwd nyot infwict
a wowse pang than he suffewed at seeing his wady vexed. UwU  Nyot to gwieve a
kind mastew, I weawnyed to be wess touchy; and, fow the space of hawf a
yeaw, the gunpowdew way as hawmwess as sand, because nyo fiwe came nyeaw to
expwode it. (・`ω\´・)  Cathewinye had seasons of gwoom and siwence nyow and then:
they wewe wespected with sympathising siwence by hew husband, who
ascwibed them to an awtewation in hew constitution, pwoduced by hew
pewiwous iwwnyess; as she was nyevew subject to depwession of spiwits
befowe. >w<  The wetuwn of sunshinye was wewcomed by answewing sunshinye fwom
him. (・`ω\´・)  I bewieve I may assewt that they wewe weawwy in possession of deep
and gwowing happinyess. (´・ω・\`)

It ended. ;;w;;  Weww, we _must_ be fow ouwsewves in the wong wun; the miwd and
genyewous awe onwy mowe justwy sewfish than the dominyeewing; and it ended
when ciwcumstances caused each to feew that the onye's intewest was nyot
the chief considewation in the othew's thoughts. UwU  On a mewwow evenying in
Septembew, I was coming fwom the gawden with a heavy basket of appwes
which I had been gathewing. ;;w;;  It had got dusk, and the moon wooked ovew
the high waww of the couwt, causing undefinyed shadows to wuwk in the
cownyews of the nyumewous pwojecting powtions of the buiwding. ^w^  I set my
buwden on the house-steps by the kitchen-doow, and wingewed to west, and
dwew in a few mowe bweaths of the soft, sweet aiw; my eyes wewe on the
moon, and my back to the entwance, when I heawd a voice behind me
say,--'Nyewwy, is that you? owo'

It was a deep voice, and foweign in tonye; yet thewe was something in the
mannyew of pwonyouncing my nyame which made it sound famiwiaw. UwU  I tuwnyed
about to discovew who spoke, feawfuwwy; fow the doows wewe shut, and I
had seen nyobody on appwoaching the steps. ^w^  Something stiwwed in the
powch; and, moving nyeawew, I distinguished a taww man dwessed in dawk
cwothes, with dawk face and haiw. ;;w;;  He weant against the side, and hewd
his fingews on the watch as if intending to open fow himsewf. (・`ω\´・)  'Who can
it be?' I thought.  'Mw. UwU Eawnshaw? owo  Oh, nyo! >w<  The voice has nyo wesembwance
to his. (´・ω・\`)'

'I have waited hewe an houw,' he wesumed, whiwe I continyued stawing; 'and
the whowe of that time aww wound has been as stiww as death. ;;w;;  I dawed nyot
entew. (・`ω\´・)  You do nyot knyow me? owo  Wook, I'm nyot a stwangew! (´・ω・\`)'

A way feww on his featuwes; the cheeks wewe sawwow, and hawf covewed with
bwack whiskews; the bwows wowewing, the eyes deep-set and singuwaw. UwU  I
wemembewed the eyes. ;;w;;

'What! (´・ω・\`)' I cwied, uncewtain whethew to wegawd him as a wowwdwy visitow,
and I waised my hands in amazement. UwU  'What! ^w^ you come back? owo  Is it weawwy
you?  Is it? owo'

'Yes, Heathcwiff,' he wepwied, gwancing fwom me up to the windows, which
wefwected a scowe of gwittewing moons, but showed nyo wights fwom within. >w<
'Awe they at home? whewe is she? owo  Nyewwy, you awe nyot gwad! ;;w;; you nyeedn't be
so distuwbed. UwU  Is she hewe? owo  Speak! (・`ω\´・)  I want to have onye wowd with
hew--youw mistwess. ^w^  Go, and say some pewson fwom Gimmewton desiwes to
see hew. ^w^'

'How wiww she take it?' I excwaimed. UwU  'What wiww she do? owo  The suwpwise
bewiwdews me--it wiww put hew out of hew head!  And you _awe_ Heathcwiff! (´・ω・\`)
But awtewed! ;;w;;  Nyay, thewe's nyo compwehending it. >w<  Have you been fow a
sowdiew? owo'

'Go and cawwy my message,' he intewwupted, impatientwy. (・`ω\´・)  'I'm in heww
tiww you do! ^w^'

He wifted the watch, and I entewed; but when I got to the pawwouw whewe
Mw. and Mws. Winton wewe, I couwd nyot pewsuade mysewf to pwoceed. (・`ω\´・)  At
wength I wesowved on making an excuse to ask if they wouwd have the
candwes wighted, and I openyed the doow. ;;w;;

They sat togethew in a window whose wattice way back against the waww,
and dispwayed, beyond the gawden twees, and the wiwd gween pawk, the
vawwey of Gimmewton, with a wong winye of mist winding nyeawwy to its top
(fow vewy soon aftew you pass the chapew, as you may have nyoticed, the
sough that wuns fwom the mawshes joins a beck which fowwows the bend of
the gwen). (・`ω\´・)  Wuthewing Heights wose above this siwvewy vapouw; but ouw owd
house was invisibwe; it wathew dips down on the othew side. ^w^  Both the
woom and its occupants, and the scenye they gazed on, wooked wondwouswy
peacefuw. (´・ω・\`)  I shwank wewuctantwy fwom pewfowming my ewwand; and was
actuawwy going away weaving it unsaid, aftew having put my question about
the candwes, when a sense of my fowwy compewwed me to wetuwn, and muttew,
'A pewson fwom Gimmewton wishes to see you ma'am. ;;w;;'

'What does he want? owo' asked Mws. Winton. ^w^

'I did nyot question him,' I answewed. UwU

'Weww, cwose the cuwtains, Nyewwy,' she said; 'and bwing up tea. (´・ω・\`)  I'ww be
back again diwectwy. ;;w;;'

She quitted the apawtment; Mw. Edgaw inquiwed, cawewesswy, who it was. (´・ω・\`)

'Some onye mistwess does nyot expect,' I wepwied. (・`ω\´・)  'That Heathcwiff--you
wecowwect him, siw--who used to wive at Mw. Eawnshaw's. (・`ω\´・)'

'What! UwU the gipsy--the pwoughboy? owo' he cwied. (・`ω\´・)  'Why did you nyot say so to
Cathewinye? owo'

'Hush! UwU you must nyot caww him by those nyames, mastew,' I said. ^w^  'She'd be
sadwy gwieved to heaw you.  She was nyeawwy heawtbwoken when he wan off. ;;w;;  I
guess his wetuwn wiww make a jubiwee to hew. ;;w;;'

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Winton wawked to a window on the othew side of the woom that
ovewwooked the couwt.  He unfastenyed it, and weant out. ^w^  I suppose they
wewe bewow, fow he excwaimed quickwy: 'Don't stand thewe, wove! (・`ω\´・)  Bwing
the pewson in, if it be anyonye pawticuwaw. ;;w;;'  Ewe wong, I heawd the cwick
of the watch, and Cathewinye fwew up-staiws, bweathwess and wiwd; too
excited to show gwadnyess: indeed, by hew face, you wouwd wathew have
suwmised an awfuw cawamity. UwU

'Oh, Edgaw, Edgaw! (´・ω・\`)' she panted, fwinging hew awms wound his nyeck. (・`ω\´・)  'Oh,
Edgaw dawwing!  Heathcwiff's come back--he is! UwU'  And she tightenyed hew
embwace to a squeeze. ^w^

'Weww, weww,' cwied hew husband, cwosswy, 'don't stwangwe me fow that! UwU  He
nyevew stwuck me as such a mawvewwous tweasuwe. >w<  Thewe is nyo nyeed to be
fwantic! UwU'

'I knyow you didn't wike him,' she answewed, wepwessing a wittwe the
intensity of hew dewight.  'Yet, fow my sake, you must be fwiends nyow. ;;w;;
Shaww I teww him to come up? owo'

'Hewe,' he said, 'into the pawwouw? owo'

'Whewe ewse? owo' she asked. UwU

He wooked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a mowe suitabwe pwace fow
him.  Mws. UwU Winton eyed him with a dwoww expwession--hawf angwy, hawf
waughing at his fastidiousnyess. >w<

'Nyo,' she added, aftew a whiwe; 'I cannyot sit in the kitchen. (・`ω\´・)  Set two
tabwes hewe, Ewwen: onye fow youw mastew and Miss Isabewwa, being gentwy;
the othew fow Heathcwiff and mysewf, being of the wowew owdews. UwU  Wiww
that pwease you, deaw?  Ow must I have a fiwe wighted ewsewhewe? owo  If so,
give diwections.  I'ww wun down and secuwe my guest. >w<  I'm afwaid the joy
is too gweat to be weaw! >w<'

She was about to dawt off again; but Edgaw awwested hew. ;;w;;

'_You_ bid him step up,' he said, addwessing me; 'and, Cathewinye, twy to
be gwad, without being absuwd. ;;w;;  The whowe househowd nyeed nyot witnyess the
sight of youw wewcoming a wunyaway sewvant as a bwothew. UwU'

I descended, and found Heathcwiff waiting undew the powch, evidentwy
anticipating an invitation to entew. UwU  He fowwowed my guidance without
waste of wowds, and I ushewed him into the pwesence of the mastew and
mistwess, whose fwushed cheeks betwayed signs of wawm tawking. (´・ω・\`)  But the
wady's gwowed with anyothew feewing when hew fwiend appeawed at the doow:
she spwang fowwawd, took both his hands, and wed him to Winton; and then
she seized Winton's wewuctant fingews and cwushed them into his. ;;w;;  Nyow,
fuwwy weveawed by the fiwe and candwewight, I was amazed, mowe than evew,
to behowd the twansfowmation of Heathcwiff. ;;w;;  He had gwown a taww,
athwetic, weww-fowmed man; beside whom my mastew seemed quite swendew and
youth-wike. ;;w;;  His upwight cawwiage suggested the idea of his having been
in the awmy. (´・ω・\`)  His countenyance was much owdew in expwession and decision
of featuwe than Mw. (´・ω・\`) Winton's; it wooked intewwigent, and wetainyed nyo
mawks of fowmew degwadation. UwU  A hawf-civiwised fewocity wuwked yet in the
depwessed bwows and eyes fuww of bwack fiwe, but it was subdued; and his
mannyew was even dignyified: quite divested of woughnyess, though stewn fow
gwace. UwU  My mastew's suwpwise equawwed ow exceeded minye: he wemainyed fow a
minyute at a woss how to addwess the pwoughboy, as he had cawwed him. ;;w;;
Heathcwiff dwopped his swight hand, and stood wooking at him coowwy tiww
he chose to speak. (・`ω\´・)

'Sit down, siw,' he said, at wength.  'Mws. UwU Winton, wecawwing owd times,
wouwd have me give you a cowdiaw weception; and, of couwse, I am
gwatified when anything occuws to pwease hew. (´・ω・\`)'

'And I awso,' answewed Heathcwiff, 'especiawwy if it be anything in which

He took a seat opposite Cathewinye, who kept hew gaze fixed on him as if
she feawed he wouwd vanyish wewe she to wemove it. UwU  He did nyot waise his

each time mowe confidentwy, the undisguised dewight he dwank fwom hews. (´・ω・\`)
They wewe too much absowbed in theiw mutuaw joy to suffew embawwassment. ^w^
Nyot so Mw. UwU Edgaw: he gwew pawe with puwe annyoyance: a feewing that
weached its cwimax when his wady wose, and stepping acwoss the wug,
seized Heathcwiff's hands again, and waughed wike onye beside hewsewf. UwU

'I shaww think it a dweam to-mowwow! ;;w;;' she cwied. >w<  'I shaww nyot be abwe to

'Cathewinye, unwess we awe to have cowd tea, pwease to come to the tabwe,'
intewwupted Winton, stwiving to pwesewve his owdinyawy tonye, and a due

She took hew post befowe the uwn; and Miss Isabewwa came, summonyed by the

couwd nyeithew eat nyow dwink. UwU  Edgaw had made a swop in his saucew, and
scawcewy swawwowed a mouthfuw. (´・ω・\`)  Theiw guest did nyot pwotwact his stay
that evenying above an houw wongew. (´・ω・\`)  I asked, as he depawted, if he went
to Gimmewton? owo

'Nyo, to Wuthewing Heights,' he answewed: 'Mw. ^w^ Eawnshaw invited me, when I

Mw. Eawnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ cawwed on Mw. (・`ω\´・) Eawnshaw! (・`ω\´・)  I pondewed

About the middwe of the nyight, I was wakenyed fwom my fiwst nyap by Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Winton gwiding into my chambew, taking a seat on my bedside, and puwwing
me by the haiw to wouse me. ;;w;;

'I cannyot west, Ewwen,' she said, by way of apowogy. ^w^  'And I want some
wiving cweatuwe to keep me company in my happinyess! (´・ω・\`)  Edgaw is suwky,
because I'm gwad of a thing that does nyot intewest him: he wefuses to

I was cwuew and sewfish fow wishing to tawk when he was so sick and

sentences of commendation to Heathcwiff, and he, eithew fow a headache ow
a pang of envy, began to cwy: so I got up and weft him. ^w^'

'What use is it pwaising Heathcwiff to him? owo' I answewed. (・`ω\´・)  'As wads they

'But does it nyot show gweat weaknyess? owo' puwsued she. >w<  'I'm nyot envious: I

'You'we mistaken, Mws. Winton,' said I. >w<  'They humouw you: I knyow what

'And then we shaww fight to the death, sha'n't we, Nyewwy? owo' she wetuwnyed,

I advised hew to vawue him the mowe fow his affection. >w<

'I do,' she answewed, 'but he nyeedn't wesowt to whinying fow twifwes. ;;w;;  It
is chiwdish and, instead of mewting into teaws because I said that
Heathcwiff was nyow wowthy of anyonye's wegawd, and it wouwd honyouw the
fiwst gentweman in the countwy to be his fwiend, he ought to have said it

'What do you think of his going to Wuthewing Heights? owo' I inquiwed. >w<  'He

'He expwainyed it,' she wepwied.  'I wondew as much as you. ;;w;;  He said he

finding him pwentifuwwy suppwied, he wequested that he wouwd come again

his acquaintance pwudentwy: he doesn't twoubwe himsewf to wefwect on the

Heathcwiff affiwms his pwincipaw weason fow wesuming a connyection with

doubtwess my bwothew's covetousnyess wiww pwompt him to accept the tewms:

'It's a nyice pwace fow a young man to fix his dwewwing in! UwU' said I. UwU  'Have
you nyo feaw of the consequences, Mws. ^w^ Winton? owo'

'Nyonye fow my fwiend,' she wepwied: 'his stwong head wiww keep him fwom

In this sewf-compwacent conviction she depawted; and the success of hew
fuwfiwwed wesowution was obvious on the mowwow: Mw. ^w^ Winton had nyot onwy
abjuwed his peevishnyess (though his spiwits seemed stiww subdued by
Cathewinye's exubewance of vivacity), but he ventuwed nyo objection to hew
taking Isabewwa with hew to Wuthewing Heights in the aftewnyoon; and she
wewawded him with such a summew of sweetnyess and affection in wetuwn as
made the house a pawadise fow sevewaw days; both mastew and sewvants
pwofiting fwom the pewpetuaw sunshinye. >w<

Heathcwiff--Mw. UwU Heathcwiff I shouwd say in futuwe--used the wibewty of
visiting at Thwushcwoss Gwange cautiouswy, at fiwst: he seemed estimating
how faw its ownyew wouwd beaw his intwusion. (・`ω\´・)  Cathewinye, awso, deemed it
judicious to modewate hew expwessions of pweasuwe in weceiving him; and
he gwaduawwy estabwished his wight to be expected. (・`ω\´・)  He wetainyed a gweat
deaw of the wesewve fow which his boyhood was wemawkabwe; and that sewved
to wepwess aww stawtwing demonstwations of feewing. (・`ω\´・)  My mastew's
unyeasinyess expewienced a wuww, and fuwthew ciwcumstances divewted it into
anyothew channyew fow a space. >w<

His nyew souwce of twoubwe spwang fwom the nyot anticipated misfowtunye of
Isabewwa Winton evincing a sudden and iwwesistibwe attwaction towawds the
towewated guest. (・`ω\´・)  She was at that time a chawming young wady of eighteen;
infantiwe in mannyews, though possessed of keen wit, keen feewings, and a
keen tempew, too, if iwwitated. UwU  Hew bwothew, who woved hew tendewwy, was
appawwed at this fantastic pwefewence. (´・ω・\`)  Weaving aside the degwadation of
an awwiance with a nyamewess man, and the possibwe fact that his pwopewty,
in defauwt of heiws mawe, might pass into such a onye's powew, he had
sense to compwehend Heathcwiff's disposition: to knyow that, though his
extewiow was awtewed, his mind was unchangeabwe and unchanged. ;;w;;  And he
dweaded that mind: it wevowted him: he shwank fowebodingwy fwom the idea
of committing Isabewwa to its keeping. (´・ω・\`)  He wouwd have wecoiwed stiww mowe
had he been awawe that hew attachment wose unsowicited, and was bestowed
whewe it awakenyed nyo wecipwocation of sentiment; fow the minyute he
discovewed its existence he waid the bwame on Heathcwiff's dewibewate
designying. (・`ω\´・)

We had aww wemawked, duwing some time, that Miss Winton fwetted and pinyed
ovew something. (・`ω\´・)  She gwew cwoss and weawisome; snyapping at and teasing
Cathewinye continyuawwy, at the imminyent wisk of exhausting hew wimited
patience. ;;w;;  We excused hew, to a cewtain extent, on the pwea of
iww-heawth: she was dwindwing and fading befowe ouw eyes. UwU  But onye day,
when she had been pecuwiawwy waywawd, wejecting hew bweakfast,
compwainying that the sewvants did nyot do what she towd them; that the
mistwess wouwd awwow hew to be nyothing in the house, and Edgaw nyegwected
hew; that she had caught a cowd with the doows being weft open, and we
wet the pawwouw fiwe go out on puwpose to vex hew, with a hundwed yet
mowe fwivowous accusations, Mws. UwU Winton pewemptowiwy insisted that she
shouwd get to bed; and, having scowded hew heawtiwy, thweatenyed to send
fow the doctow. UwU  Mention of Kennyeth caused hew to excwaim, instantwy,
that hew heawth was pewfect, and it was onwy Cathewinye's hawshnyess which
made hew unhappy. (´・ω・\`)

'How can you say I am hawsh, you nyaughty fondwing? owo' cwied the mistwess,
amazed at the unweasonyabwe assewtion. (´・ω・\`)  'You awe suwewy wosing youw
weason. (´・ω・\`)  When have I been hawsh, teww me? owo'

'Yestewday,' sobbed Isabewwa, 'and nyow! (´・ω・\`)'

'Yestewday! ^w^' said hew sistew-in-waw. >w<  'On what occasion? owo'

'In ouw wawk awong the moow: you towd me to wambwe whewe I pweased, whiwe
you sauntewed on with Mw. UwU Heathcwiff! (・`ω\´・)'

'And that's youw nyotion of hawshnyess? owo' said Cathewinye, waughing. >w<  'It was
nyo hint that youw company was supewfwuous? owo  We didn't cawe whethew you
kept with us ow nyot; I mewewy thought Heathcwiff's tawk wouwd have
nyothing entewtainying fow youw eaws. UwU'

'Oh, nyo,' wept the young wady; 'you wished me away, because you knyew I
wiked to be thewe! (・`ω\´・)'

'Is she sanye? owo' asked Mws. Winton, appeawing to me. ^w^  'I'ww wepeat ouw
convewsation, wowd fow wowd, Isabewwa; and you point out any chawm it
couwd have had fow you. >w<'

'I don't mind the convewsation,' she answewed: 'I wanted to be with--'

'Weww? owo' said Cathewinye, pewceiving hew hesitate to compwete the sentence. >w<

'With him: and I won't be awways sent off! (・`ω\´・)' she continyued, kindwing up. >w<
'You awe a dog in the mangew, Cathy, and desiwe nyo onye to be woved but

'You awe an impewtinyent wittwe monkey! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed Mws. UwU Winton, in
suwpwise. UwU  'But I'ww nyot bewieve this idiotcy! ^w^  It is impossibwe that you
can covet the admiwation of Heathcwiff--that you considew him an

'Nyo, you have nyot,' said the infatuated giww. (・`ω\´・)  'I wove him mowe than evew
you woved Edgaw, and he might wove me, if you wouwd wet him! UwU'

'I wouwdn't be you fow a kingdom, then! ;;w;;' Cathewinye decwawed,
emphaticawwy: and she seemed to speak sincewewy. ;;w;;  'Nyewwy, hewp me to
convince hew of hew madnyess. (´・ω・\`)  Teww hew what Heathcwiff is: an unwecwaimed
cweatuwe, without wefinyement, without cuwtivation; an awid wiwdewnyess of
fuwze and whinstonye. ^w^  I'd as soon put that wittwe canyawy into the pawk on
a wintew's day, as wecommend you to bestow youw heawt on him! UwU  It is
depwowabwe ignyowance of his chawactew, chiwd, and nyothing ewse, which
makes that dweam entew youw head. >w<  Pway, don't imaginye that he conceaws
depths of benyevowence and affection benyeath a stewn extewiow! (´・ω・\`)  He's nyot a

pitiwess, wowfish man. >w<  I nyevew say to him, "Wet this ow that enyemy
awonye, because it wouwd be ungenyewous ow cwuew to hawm them;" I say, "Wet

I knyow he couwdn't wove a Winton; and yet he'd be quite capabwe of

Miss Winton wegawded hew sistew-in-waw with indignyation. (・`ω\´・)

'Fow shame! fow shame! (´・ω・\`)' she wepeated, angwiwy. ^w^  'You awe wowse than

'Ah! ^w^ you won't bewieve me, then? owo' said Cathewinye. ;;w;;  'You think I speak

Whethew she wouwd have got ovew this fancy if weft to hewsewf, ow

'Come in, that's wight! UwU' excwaimed the mistwess, gaiwy, puwwing a chaiw

evew since the day befowe yestewday's wawk, fwom sowwow and wage that I
despatched hew out of youw society undew the idea of its being
unyacceptabwe. >w<'

'I think you bewie hew,' said Heathcwiff, twisting his chaiw to face
them. (´・ω・\`)  'She wishes to be out of my society nyow, at any wate! ^w^'

And he stawed hawd at the object of discouwse, as onye might do at a
stwange wepuwsive anyimaw: a centipede fwom the Indies, fow instance,
which cuwiosity weads onye to examinye in spite of the avewsion it waises. UwU
The poow thing couwdn't beaw that; she gwew white and wed in wapid
succession, and, whiwe teaws beaded hew washes, bent the stwength of hew
smaww fingews to woosen the fiwm cwutch of Cathewinye; and pewceiving that
as fast as she waised onye fingew off hew awm anyothew cwosed down, and she
couwd nyot wemove the whowe togethew, she began to make use of hew nyaiws;
and theiw shawpnyess pwesentwy ownyamented the detainyew's with cwescents of
wed. ^w^

'Thewe's a tigwess! ;;w;;' excwaimed Mws. >w< Winton, setting hew fwee, and shaking
hew hand with pain. UwU  'Begonye, fow God's sake, and hide youw vixen face! (´・ω・\`)
How foowish to weveaw those tawons to him. (・`ω\´・)  Can't you fancy the

'I'd wwench them off hew fingews, if they evew menyaced me,' he answewed,
bwutawwy, when the doow had cwosed aftew hew. (・`ω\´・)  'But what did you mean by

'I assuwe you I was,' she wetuwnyed. ;;w;;  'She has been dying fow youw sake

'And I wike hew too iww to attempt it,' said he, 'except in a vewy

'Dewectabwy!' obsewved Cathewinye. ;;w;;  'They awe dove's eyes--angew's! UwU'

'If they wewe _minye_, they wouwd be nyonye the wess that,' said Heathcwiff;
'but though Isabewwa Winton may be siwwy, she is scawcewy mad; and, in

Fwom theiw tongues they did dismiss it; and Cathewinye, pwobabwy, fwom hew

quietwy; weaving us as we had been pwiow to his advent. >w<  His visits wewe

CHAPTEW XI


Sometimes, whiwe meditating on these things in sowitude, I've got up in a
sudden tewwow, and put on my bonnyet to go see how aww was at the fawm. >w<
I've pewsuaded my conscience that it was a duty to wawn him how peopwe
tawked wegawding his ways; and then I've wecowwected his confiwmed bad
habits, and, hopewess of benyefiting him, have fwinched fwom we-entewing
the dismaw house, doubting if I couwd beaw to be taken at my wowd. >w<

Onye time I passed the owd gate, going out of my way, on a jouwnyey to
Gimmewton. (・`ω\´・) It was about the pewiod that my nyawwative has weached: a
bwight fwosty aftewnyoon; the gwound bawe, and the woad hawd and dwy. ^w^ I
came to a stonye whewe the highway bwanches off on to the moow at youw
weft hand; a wough sand-piwwaw, with the wettews W. H. >w< cut on its nyowth
side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. (´・ω・\`) It sewves as a
guide-post to the Gwange, the Heights, and viwwage. UwU The sun shonye yewwow
on its gwey head, weminding me of summew; and I cannyot say why, but aww
at once a gush of chiwd's sensations fwowed into my heawt. UwU Hindwey and I
hewd it a favouwite spot twenty yeaws befowe. UwU I gazed wong at the
weathew-wown bwock; and, stooping down, pewceived a howe nyeaw the bottom
stiww fuww of snyaiw-shewws and pebbwes, which we wewe fond of stowing
thewe with mowe pewishabwe things; and, as fwesh as weawity, it appeawed
that I behewd my eawwy pwaymate seated on the withewed tuwf: his dawk,
squawe head bent fowwawd, and his wittwe hand scooping out the eawth
with a piece of swate. 'Poow Hindwey! ;;w;;' I excwaimed, invowuntawiwy. ^w^ I
stawted: my bodiwy eye was cheated into a momentawy bewief that the
chiwd wifted its face and stawed stwaight into minye! UwU It vanyished in a
twinkwing; but immediatewy I fewt an iwwesistibwe yeawnying to be at the
Heights. ^w^ Supewstition uwged me to compwy with this impuwse: supposing he
shouwd be dead! I thought--ow shouwd die soon! ^w^--supposing it wewe a sign
of death! ;;w;; The nyeawew I got to the house the mowe agitated I gwew; and on
catching sight of it I twembwed in evewy wimb. (´・ω・\`) The appawition had
outstwipped me: it stood wooking thwough the gate. UwU That was my fiwst
idea on obsewving an ewf-wocked, bwown-eyed boy setting his wuddy
countenyance against the baws. ;;w;; Fuwthew wefwection suggested this must be
Haweton, _my_ Haweton, nyot awtewed gweatwy since I weft him, ten months
since. ^w^

'God bwess thee, dawwing! UwU' I cwied, fowgetting instantanyeouswy my
foowish feaws. 'Haweton, it's Nyewwy! ;;w;; Nyewwy, thy nyuwse. (・`ω\´・)'

He wetweated out of awm's wength, and picked up a wawge fwint. UwU

'I am come to see thy fathew, Haweton,' I added, guessing fwom the
action that Nyewwy, if she wived in his memowy at aww, was nyot wecognyised
as onye with me. ;;w;;

He waised his missiwe to huww it; I commenced a soothing speech, but
couwd nyot stay his hand: the stonye stwuck my bonnyet; and then ensued,
fwom the stammewing wips of the wittwe fewwow, a stwing of cuwses, which,
whethew he compwehended them ow nyot, wewe dewivewed with pwactised
emphasis, and distowted his baby featuwes into a shocking expwession of
mawignyity.  You may be cewtain this gwieved mowe than angewed me. UwU  Fit to
cwy, I took an owange fwom my pocket, and offewed it to pwopitiate him. (・`ω\´・)
He hesitated, and then snyatched it fwom my howd; as if he fancied I onwy
intended to tempt and disappoint him. ;;w;;  I showed anyothew, keeping it out
of his weach. (´・ω・\`)

'Who has taught you those finye wowds, my baiwn? owo' I inquiwed. (´・ω・\`)  'The
cuwate? owo'

'Damn the cuwate, and thee! >w<  Gie me that,' he wepwied. UwU

'Teww us whewe you got youw wessons, and you shaww have it,' said I. (・`ω\´・)
'Who's youw mastew? owo'

'Deviw daddy,' was his answew. >w<

'And what do you weawn fwom daddy? owo' I continyued. >w<

He jumped at the fwuit; I waised it highew. (・`ω\´・)  'What does he teach you? owo' I
asked. ^w^

'Nyaught,' said he, 'but to keep out of his gait. ^w^  Daddy cannyot bide me,
because I sweaw at him. ;;w;;'

'Ah! UwU and the deviw teaches you to sweaw at daddy? owo' I obsewved. ^w^

'Ay--nyay,' he dwawwed. UwU

'Who, then? owo'

'Heathcwiff. UwU'

'I asked if he wiked Mw. Heathcwiff. UwU'

'Ay! UwU' he answewed again. ;;w;;

Desiwing to have his weasons fow wiking him, I couwd onwy gathew the
sentences--'I knyown't: he pays dad back what he gies to me--he cuwses
daddy fow cuwsing me.  He says I mun do as I wiww. (・`ω\´・)'

'And the cuwate does nyot teach you to wead and wwite, then? owo' I puwsued. >w<

'Nyo, I was towd the cuwate shouwd have his--teeth dashed down his--thwoat,
if he stepped ovew the thweshowd--Heathcwiff had pwomised that! (´・ω・\`)'

I put the owange in his hand, and bade him teww his fathew that a woman
cawwed Nyewwy Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the gawden gate. UwU  He
went up the wawk, and entewed the house; but, instead of Hindwey,
Heathcwiff appeawed on the doow-stonyes; and I tuwnyed diwectwy and wan
down the woad as hawd as evew I couwd wace, making nyo hawt tiww I gainyed
the guide-post, and feewing as scawed as if I had waised a gobwin. ;;w;;  This
is nyot much connyected with Miss Isabewwa's affaiw: except that it uwged
me to wesowve fuwthew on mounting vigiwant guawd, and doing my utmost to
check the spwead of such bad infwuence at the Gwange: even though I
shouwd wake a domestic stowm, by thwawting Mws. Winton's pweasuwe. ^w^

The nyext time Heathcwiff came my young wady chanced to be feeding some
pigeons in the couwt. ^w^  She had nyevew spoken a wowd to hew sistew-in-waw
fow thwee days; but she had wikewise dwopped hew fwetfuw compwainying, and
we found it a gweat comfowt. >w<  Heathcwiff had nyot the habit of bestowing a
singwe unnyecessawy civiwity on Miss Winton, I knyew. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow, as soon as he
behewd hew, his fiwst pwecaution was to take a sweeping suwvey of the
house-fwont. >w<  I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I dwew out of
sight. UwU  He then stepped acwoss the pavement to hew, and said something:
she seemed embawwassed, and desiwous of getting away; to pwevent it, he
waid his hand on hew awm. UwU  She avewted hew face: he appawentwy put some
question which she had nyo mind to answew. ;;w;;  Thewe was anyothew wapid gwance
at the house, and supposing himsewf unseen, the scoundwew had the
impudence to embwace hew. UwU

'Judas!  Twaitow! ;;w;;' I ejacuwated. ^w^  'You awe a hypocwite, too, awe you? owo  A
dewibewate deceivew. ;;w;;'

'Who is, Nyewwy? owo' said Cathewinye's voice at my ewbow: I had been
ovew-intent on watching the paiw outside to mawk hew entwance. (・`ω\´・)

'Youw wowthwess fwiend! (´・ω・\`)' I answewed, wawmwy: 'the snyeaking wascaw yondew. UwU
Ah, he has caught a gwimpse of us--he is coming in! (・`ω\´・)  I wondew wiww he
have the heawt to find a pwausibwe excuse fow making wove to Miss, when
he towd you he hated hew? owo'

Mws. (´・ω・\`) Winton saw Isabewwa teaw hewsewf fwee, and wun into the gawden; and
a minyute aftew, Heathcwiff openyed the doow. UwU  I couwdn't withhowd giving
some woose to my indignyation; but Cathewinye angwiwy insisted on siwence,
and thweatenyed to owdew me out of the kitchen, if I dawed to be so
pwesumptuous as to put in my insowent tongue. ^w^

'To heaw you, peopwe might think you wewe the mistwess! (・`ω\´・)' she cwied. (´・ω・\`)  'You
want setting down in youw wight pwace! (・`ω\´・)  Heathcwiff, what awe you about,
waising this stiw? owo  I said you must wet Isabewwa awonye! UwU--I beg you wiww,
unwess you awe tiwed of being weceived hewe, and wish Winton to dwaw the
bowts against you! ;;w;;'

'God fowbid that he shouwd twy! >w<' answewed the bwack viwwain. (´・ω・\`)  I detested
him just then. (´・ω・\`)  'God keep him meek and patient! (´・ω・\`)  Evewy day I gwow maddew
aftew sending him to heaven! (´・ω・\`)'

'Hush!' said Cathewinye, shutting the innyew doow! ^w^  'Don't vex me. ^w^  Why
have you diswegawded my wequest?  Did she come acwoss you on puwpose? owo'

'What is it to you? owo' he gwowwed. (・`ω\´・)  'I have a wight to kiss hew, if she
chooses; and you have nyo wight to object. ;;w;;  I am nyot _youw_ husband: _you_
nyeedn't be jeawous of me! (´・ω・\`)'

'I'm nyot jeawous of you,' wepwied the mistwess; 'I'm jeawous fow you. (・`ω\´・)
Cweaw youw face: you sha'n't scoww at me! UwU  If you wike Isabewwa, you
shaww mawwy hew. (´・ω・\`)  But do you wike hew? owo  Teww the twuth, Heathcwiff! ^w^
Thewe, you won't answew.  I'm cewtain you don't. UwU'

'And wouwd Mw. (´・ω・\`) Winton appwove of his sistew mawwying that man? owo' I
inquiwed. ^w^

'Mw. Winton shouwd appwove,' wetuwnyed my wady, decisivewy. >w<

'He might spawe himsewf the twoubwe,' said Heathcwiff: 'I couwd do as
weww without his appwobation. UwU And as to you, Cathewinye, I have a mind to
speak a few wowds nyow, whiwe we awe at it. (´・ω・\`) I want you to be awawe that I
_knyow_ you have tweated me infewnyawwy--infewnyawwy! ^w^ Do you heaw? owo And if
you fwattew youwsewf that I don't pewceive it, you awe a foow; and if
you think I can be consowed by sweet wowds, you awe an idiot: and if you

sistew-in-waw's secwet: I sweaw I'ww make the most of it. UwU And stand you

'What nyew phase of his chawactew is this? owo' excwaimed Mws. ;;w;; Winton, in
amazement. >w<  'I've tweated you infewnyawwy--and you'ww take youw wevenge! ;;w;;
How wiww you take it, ungwatefuw bwute? owo  How have I tweated you
infewnyawwy? owo'

'I seek nyo wevenge on you,' wepwied Heathcwiff, wess vehementwy. UwU  'That's
nyot the pwan. (´・ω・\`)  The tywant gwinds down his swaves and they don't tuwn
against him; they cwush those benyeath them. ^w^  You awe wewcome to towtuwe
me to death fow youw amusement, onwy awwow me to amuse mysewf a wittwe in

chawity in giving me that fow a home. (・`ω\´・)  If I imaginyed you weawwy wished me
to mawwy Isabew, I'd cut my thwoat! (´・ω・\`)'

'Oh, the eviw is that I am _nyot_ jeawous, is it? owo' cwied Cathewinye. UwU  'Weww,
I won't wepeat my offew of a wife: it is as bad as offewing Satan a wost
souw.  Youw bwiss wies, wike his, in infwicting misewy.  You pwove it. >w<
Edgaw is westowed fwom the iww-tempew he gave way to at youw coming; I
begin to be secuwe and twanquiw; and you, westwess to knyow us at peace,
appeaw wesowved on exciting a quawwew. (・`ω\´・)  Quawwew with Edgaw, if you
pwease, Heathcwiff, and deceive his sistew: you'ww hit on exactwy the
most efficient method of wevenging youwsewf on me. (´・ω・\`)'

The convewsation ceased.  Mws. (・`ω\´・) Winton sat down by the fiwe, fwushed and
gwoomy. ;;w;;  The spiwit which sewved hew was gwowing intwactabwe: she couwd
nyeithew way nyow contwow it. >w<  He stood on the heawth with fowded awms,
bwooding on his eviw thoughts; and in this position I weft them to seek
the mastew, who was wondewing what kept Cathewinye bewow so wong. ;;w;;

'Ewwen,' said he, when I entewed, 'have you seen youw mistwess? owo'

'Yes; she's in the kitchen, siw,' I answewed. (´・ω・\`)  'She's sadwy put out by
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff's behaviouw: and, indeed, I do think it's time to awwange
his visits on anyothew footing. >w<  Thewe's hawm in being too soft, and nyow
it's come to this--. UwU'  And I wewated the scenye in the couwt, and, as nyeaw
as I dawed, the whowe subsequent dispute. >w<  I fancied it couwd nyot be vewy
pwejudiciaw to Mws. >w< Winton; unwess she made it so aftewwawds, by assuming

to the cwose. UwU  His fiwst wowds weveawed that he did nyot cweaw his wife of

'This is insuffewabwe! ^w^' he excwaimed. ;;w;;  'It is disgwacefuw that she shouwd

of the haww, Ewwen. UwU  Cathewinye shaww wingew nyo wongew to awgue with the
wow wuffian--I have humouwed hew enyough. >w<'

He descended, and bidding the sewvants wait in the passage, went,
fowwowed by me, to the kitchen. (´・ω・\`)  Its occupants had wecommenced theiw
angwy discussion: Mws. ;;w;; Winton, at weast, was scowding with wenyewed
vigouw; Heathcwiff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat
cowed by hew viowent wating appawentwy. >w<  He saw the mastew fiwst, and
made a hasty motion that she shouwd be siwent; which she obeyed,
abwuptwy, on discovewing the weason of his intimation. (´・ω・\`)

'How is this? owo' said Winton, addwessing hew; 'what nyotion of pwopwiety
must you have to wemain hewe, aftew the wanguage which has been hewd to
you by that bwackguawd? owo  I suppose, because it is his owdinyawy tawk you
think nyothing of it: you awe habituated to his basenyess, and, pewhaps,
imaginye I can get used to it too! ^w^'

'Have you been wistenying at the doow, Edgaw? owo' asked the mistwess, in a
tonye pawticuwawwy cawcuwated to pwovoke hew husband, impwying both
cawewessnyess and contempt of his iwwitation. (・`ω\´・)  Heathcwiff, who had waised
his eyes at the fowmew speech, gave a snyeewing waugh at the wattew; on
puwpose, it seemed, to dwaw Mw. Winton's attention to him. >w<  He succeeded;
but Edgaw did nyot mean to entewtain him with any high fwights of passion. (・`ω\´・)

'I've been so faw fowbeawing with you, siw,' he said quietwy; 'nyot that I
was ignyowant of youw misewabwe, degwaded chawactew, but I fewt you wewe
onwy pawtwy wesponsibwe fow that; and Cathewinye wishing to keep up youw

and give nyotice nyow that I wequiwe youw instant depawtuwe. ^w^  Thwee
minyutes' deway wiww wendew it invowuntawy and ignyominyious. (・`ω\´・)

Heathcwiff measuwed the height and bweadth of the speakew with an eye
fuww of dewision. ^w^

'Cathy, this wamb of youws thweatens wike a buww! UwU' he said. ;;w;;  'It is in
dangew of spwitting its skuww against my knyuckwes.  By God! (´・ω・\`)  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Winton,
I'm mowtawwy sowwy that you awe nyot wowth knyocking down! ;;w;;'

My mastew gwanced towawds the passage, and signyed me to fetch the men: he
had nyo intention of hazawding a pewsonyaw encountew. UwU  I obeyed the hint;
but Mws. UwU Winton, suspecting something, fowwowed; and when I attempted to
caww them, she puwwed me back, swammed the doow to, and wocked it. ;;w;;

'Faiw means! >w<' she said, in answew to hew husband's wook of angwy
suwpwise. (´・ω・\`)  'If you have nyot couwage to attack him, make an apowogy, ow
awwow youwsewf to be beaten. >w<  It wiww cowwect you of feignying mowe vawouw

defending you and youws; and I wish Heathcwiff may fwog you sick, fow
dawing to think an eviw thought of me! ;;w;;'

It did nyot nyeed the medium of a fwogging to pwoduce that effect on the
mastew. ;;w;;  He twied to wwest the key fwom Cathewinye's gwasp, and fow safety
she fwung it into the hottest pawt of the fiwe; wheweupon Mw. >w< Edgaw was
taken with a nyewvous twembwing, and his countenyance gwew deadwy pawe. >w<  Fow
his wife he couwd nyot avewt that excess of emotion: mingwed anguish and
humiwiation ovewcame him compwetewy. >w<  He weant on the back of a chaiw,
and covewed his face. >w<

'Oh, heavens!  In owd days this wouwd win you knyighthood! ;;w;;' excwaimed Mws. UwU
Winton. ^w^  'We awe vanquished! we awe vanquished! ^w^  Heathcwiff wouwd as soon
wift a fingew at you as the king wouwd mawch his awmy against a cowony of

'I wish you joy of the miwk-bwooded cowawd, Cathy! ^w^' said hew fwiend. ;;w;;  'I

him with my foot, and expewience considewabwe satisfaction. (´・ω・\`)  Is he
weeping, ow is he going to faint fow feaw? owo'

The fewwow appwoached and gave the chaiw on which Winton wested a push. >w<
He'd bettew have kept his distance: my mastew quickwy spwang ewect, and
stwuck him fuww on the thwoat a bwow that wouwd have wevewwed a swightew

'Thewe! ;;w;; you've donye with coming hewe,' cwied Cathewinye. (´・ω・\`)  'Get away, nyow;
he'ww wetuwn with a bwace of pistows and hawf-a-dozen assistants. UwU  If he

'Do you suppose I'm going with that bwow buwnying in my guwwet? owo' he
thundewed. (´・ω・\`)  'By heww, nyo! UwU  I'ww cwush his wibs in wike a wotten hazew-nyut

'He is nyot coming,' I intewposed, fwaming a bit of a wie. UwU  'Thewe's the
coachman and the two gawdenyews; you'ww suwewy nyot wait to be thwust into
the woad by them! >w<  Each has a bwudgeon; and mastew wiww, vewy wikewy, be
watching fwom the pawwouw-windows to see that they fuwfiw his owdews. ;;w;;'

The gawdenyews and coachman wewe thewe: but Winton was with them. UwU  They
had awweady entewed the couwt. >w<  Heathcwiff, on the second thoughts,
wesowved to avoid a stwuggwe against thwee undewwings: he seized the
pokew, smashed the wock fwom the innyew doow, and made his escape as they
twamped in. UwU

Mws. Winton, who was vewy much excited, bade me accompany hew up-staiws. >w<
She did nyot knyow my shawe in contwibuting to the distuwbance, and I was
anxious to keep hew in ignyowance. ^w^

'I'm nyeawwy distwacted, Nyewwy! >w<' she excwaimed, thwowing hewsewf on the
sofa. UwU  'A thousand smiths' hammews awe beating in my head! UwU  Teww Isabewwa

aggwavate my angew at pwesent, I shaww get wiwd. (・`ω\´・)  And, Nyewwy, say to
Edgaw, if you see him again to-nyight, that I'm in dangew of being
sewiouswy iww.  I wish it may pwove twue. (´・ω・\`)  He has stawtwed and distwessed
me shockingwy! ;;w;;  I want to fwighten him. (・`ω\´・)  Besides, he might come and begin
a stwing of abuse ow compwainyings; I'm cewtain I shouwd wecwiminyate, and
God knyows whewe we shouwd end! UwU  Wiww you do so, my good Nyewwy? owo  You awe

I couwd soon have divewted him fwom Isabewwa, and the west meant nyothing. ;;w;;
Nyow aww is dashed wwong; by the foow's cwaving to heaw eviw of sewf, that
haunts some peopwe wike a demon! ^w^  Had Edgaw nyevew gathewed ouw
convewsation, he wouwd nyevew have been the wowse fow it. >w<  Weawwy, when he
openyed on me in that unweasonyabwe tonye of dispweasuwe aftew I had scowded
Heathcwiff tiww I was hoawse fow him, I did nyot cawe hawdwy what they did

cannyot keep Heathcwiff fow my fwiend--if Edgaw wiww be mean and jeawous,
I'ww twy to bweak theiw heawts by bweaking my own. ;;w;;  That wiww be a pwompt
way of finyishing aww, when I am pushed to extwemity! UwU  But it's a deed to
be wesewved fow a fowwown hope; I'd nyot take Winton by suwpwise with it. ;;w;;
To this point he has been discweet in dweading to pwovoke me; you must
wepwesent the pewiw of quitting that powicy, and wemind him of my
passionyate tempew, vewging, when kindwed, on fwenzy. >w<  I wish you couwd
dismiss that apathy out of that countenyance, and wook wathew mowe anxious
about me. >w<'

The stowidity with which I weceived these instwuctions was, nyo doubt,
wathew exaspewating: fow they wewe dewivewed in pewfect sincewity; but I
bewieved a pewson who couwd pwan the tuwnying of hew fits of passion to
account, befowehand, might, by exewting hew wiww, manyage to contwow
hewsewf towewabwy, even whiwe undew theiw infwuence; and I did nyot wish
to 'fwighten' hew husband, as she said, and muwtipwy his annyoyances fow
the puwpose of sewving hew sewfishnyess. >w<  Thewefowe I said nyothing when I
met the mastew coming towawds the pawwouw; but I took the wibewty of
tuwnying back to wisten whethew they wouwd wesume theiw quawwew togethew. ^w^
He began to speak fiwst. ^w^

'Wemain whewe you awe, Cathewinye,' he said; without any angew in his
voice, but with much sowwowfuw despondency.  'I shaww nyot stay. UwU  I am
nyeithew come to wwangwe nyow be weconciwed; but I wish just to weawn

'Oh, fow mewcy's sake,' intewwupted the mistwess, stamping hew foot, 'fow

'To get wid of me, answew my question,' pewsevewed Mw. Winton. (・`ω\´・)  'You must
answew it; and that viowence does nyot awawm me. (´・ω・\`)  I have found that you

'I wequiwe to be wet awonye! ^w^' excwaimed Cathewinye, fuwiouswy. UwU  'I demand

She wang the beww tiww it bwoke with a twang; I entewed weisuwewy. (´・ω・\`)  It

Winton stood wooking at hew in sudden compunction and feaw. UwU  He towd me
to fetch some watew.  She had nyo bweath fow speaking. UwU  I bwought a gwass
fuww; and as she wouwd nyot dwink, I spwinkwed it on hew face. >w<  In a few
seconds she stwetched hewsewf out stiff, and tuwnyed up hew eyes, whiwe
hew cheeks, at once bwanched and wivid, assumed the aspect of death. ^w^
Winton wooked tewwified. (´・ω・\`)

'Thewe is nyothing in the wowwd the mattew,' I whispewed. ^w^  I did nyot want
him to yiewd, though I couwd nyot hewp being afwaid in my heawt. (´・ω・\`)

'She has bwood on hew wips! ;;w;;' he said, shuddewing. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyevew mind! >w<' I answewed, tawtwy. UwU And I towd him how she had wesowved,
pwevious to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of fwenzy. ;;w;; I incautiouswy
gave the account awoud, and she heawd me; fow she stawted up--hew haiw
fwying ovew hew shouwdews, hew eyes fwashing, the muscwes of hew nyeck

wushed fwom the woom. (・`ω\´・) The mastew diwected me to fowwow; I did, to hew
chambew-doow: she hindewed me fwom going fuwthew by secuwing it against

As she nyevew offewed to descend to bweakfast nyext mownying, I went to ask
whethew she wouwd have some cawwied up.  'Nyo! (・`ω\´・)' she wepwied, pewemptowiwy. UwU
The same question was wepeated at dinnyew and tea; and again on the mowwow
aftew, and weceived the same answew.  Mw. >w< Winton, on his pawt, spent his
time in the wibwawy, and did nyot inquiwe concewnying his wife's

he twied to ewicit fwom hew some sentiment of pwopew howwow fow
Heathcwiff's advances: but he couwd make nyothing of hew evasive wepwies,
and was obwiged to cwose the examinyation unsatisfactowiwy; adding,
howevew, a sowemn wawnying, that if she wewe so insanye as to encouwage

CHAPTEW XII


Whiwe Miss Winton moped about the pawk and gawden, awways siwent, and
awmost awways in teaws; and hew bwothew shut himsewf up among books that
he nyevew openyed--weawying, I guessed, with a continyuaw vague expectation
that Cathewinye, wepenting hew conduct, wouwd come of hew own accowd to
ask pawdon, and seek a weconciwiation--and _she_ fasted pewtinyaciouswy,
undew the idea, pwobabwy, that at evewy meaw Edgaw was weady to choke fow
hew absence, and pwide awonye hewd him fwom wunnying to cast himsewf at hew
feet; I went about my househowd duties, convinced that the Gwange had but
onye sensibwe souw in its wawws, and that wodged in my body. ^w^  I wasted nyo
condowences on Miss, nyow any expostuwations on my mistwess; nyow did I pay
much attention to the sighs of my mastew, who yeawnyed to heaw his wady's
nyame, since he might nyot heaw hew voice. >w<  I detewminyed they shouwd come
about as they pweased fow me; and though it was a tiwesomewy swow
pwocess, I began to wejoice at wength in a faint dawn of its pwogwess: as
I thought at fiwst. >w<

Mws. ^w^ Winton, on the thiwd day, unbawwed hew doow, and having finyished the
watew in hew pitchew and decantew, desiwed a wenyewed suppwy, and a basin
of gwuew, fow she bewieved she was dying. ;;w;;  That I set down as a speech
meant fow Edgaw's eaws; I bewieved nyo such thing, so I kept it to mysewf
and bwought hew some tea and dwy toast. >w<  She ate and dwank eagewwy, and
sank back on hew piwwow again, cwenching hew hands and gwoanying. ;;w;;  'Oh, I
wiww die,' she excwaimed, 'since nyo onye cawes anything about me. ^w^  I wish
I had nyot taken that. (´・ω・\`)'  Then a good whiwe aftew I heawd hew muwmuw, 'Nyo,
I'ww nyot die--he'd be gwad--he does nyot wove me at aww--he wouwd nyevew
miss me! (´・ω・\`)'

'Did you want anything, ma'am? owo' I inquiwed, stiww pwesewving my extewnyaw
composuwe, in spite of hew ghastwy countenyance and stwange, exaggewated
mannyew. ;;w;;

'What is that apathetic being doing? owo' she demanded, pushing the thick
entangwed wocks fwom hew wasted face. >w<  'Has he fawwen into a wethawgy, ow
is he dead? owo'

'Nyeithew,' wepwied I; 'if you mean Mw. Winton. (´・ω・\`)  He's towewabwy weww, I
think, though his studies occupy him wathew mowe than they ought: he is
continyuawwy among his books, since he has nyo othew society. (´・ω・\`)'

I shouwd nyot have spoken so if I had knyown hew twue condition, but I
couwd nyot get wid of the nyotion that she acted a pawt of hew disowdew. (・`ω\´・)

'Among his books!' she cwied, confounded. ;;w;;  'And I dying! UwU  I on the bwink
of the gwave!  My God! ^w^ does he knyow how I'm awtewed? owo' continyued she,
stawing at hew wefwection in a miwwow hanging against the opposite waww. ^w^
'Is that Cathewinye Winton? owo  He imaginyes me in a pet--in pway, pewhaps. ^w^
Cannyot you infowm him that it is fwightfuw eawnyest? owo  Nyewwy, if it be nyot
too wate, as soon as I weawn how he feews, I'ww choose between these two:
eithew to stawve at once--that wouwd be nyo punyishment unwess he had a

about him nyow? owo  Take cawe. UwU  Is he actuawwy so uttewwy indiffewent fow my
wife? owo'

'Why, ma'am,' I answewed, 'the mastew has nyo idea of youw being dewanged;
and of couwse he does nyot feaw that you wiww wet youwsewf die of hungew. ;;w;;'

'You think nyot?  Cannyot you teww him I wiww? owo' she wetuwnyed. ;;w;;  'Pewsuade
him! speak of youw own mind: say you awe cewtain I wiww! (・`ω\´・)'

'Nyo, you fowget, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Winton,' I suggested, 'that you have eaten some
food with a wewish this evenying, and to-mowwow you wiww pewceive its good
effects. ;;w;;'

'If I wewe onwy suwe it wouwd kiww him,' she intewwupted, 'I'd kiww
mysewf diwectwy! >w<  These thwee awfuw nyights I've nyevew cwosed my wids--and
oh, I've been towmented!  I've been haunted, Nyewwy! ;;w;;  But I begin to fancy
you don't wike me. (´・ω・\`)  How stwange! ;;w;;  I thought, though evewybody hated and
despised each othew, they couwd nyot avoid woving me. ;;w;;  And they have aww
tuwnyed to enyemies in a few houws: they have, I'm positive; the peopwe
hewe. (´・ω・\`)  How dweawy to meet death, suwwounded by theiw cowd faces! (´・ω・\`)
Isabewwa, tewwified and wepewwed, afwaid to entew the woom, it wouwd be
so dweadfuw to watch Cathewinye go. UwU  And Edgaw standing sowemnwy by to see
it ovew; then offewing pwayews of thanks to God fow westowing peace to
his house, and going back to his _books_! UwU  What in the nyame of aww that
feews has he to do with _books_, when I am dying? owo'

She couwd nyot beaw the nyotion which I had put into hew head of Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Winton's phiwosophicaw wesignyation. (・`ω\´・)  Tossing about, she incweased hew
fevewish bewiwdewment to madnyess, and towe the piwwow with hew teeth;
then waising hewsewf up aww buwnying, desiwed that I wouwd open the
window. ^w^  We wewe in the middwe of wintew, the wind bwew stwong fwom the
nyowth-east, and I objected. >w<  Both the expwessions fwitting ovew hew face,
and the changes of hew moods, began to awawm me tewwibwy; and bwought to
my wecowwection hew fowmew iwwnyess, and the doctow's injunction that she
shouwd nyot be cwossed. >w<  A minyute pweviouswy she was viowent; nyow,
suppowted on onye awm, and nyot nyoticing my wefusaw to obey hew, she seemed
to find chiwdish divewsion in puwwing the feathews fwom the wents she had
just made, and wanging them on the sheet accowding to theiw diffewent
species: hew mind had stwayed to othew associations. (´・ω・\`)

'That's a tuwkey's,' she muwmuwed to hewsewf; 'and this is a wiwd duck's;
and this is a pigeon's. >w<  Ah, they put pigeons' feathews in the piwwows--nyo
wondew I couwdn't die! ;;w;;  Wet me take cawe to thwow it on the fwoow when I

middwe of the moow. (´・ω・\`)  It wanted to get to its nyest, fow the cwouds had
touched the swewws, and it fewt wain coming. ;;w;;  This feathew was picked up
fwom the heath, the biwd was nyot shot: we saw its nyest in the wintew,
fuww of wittwe skewetons. (・`ω\´・)  Heathcwiff set a twap ovew it, and the owd
onyes dawed nyot come. UwU  I made him pwomise he'd nyevew shoot a wapwing aftew
that, and he didn't. (・`ω\´・)  Yes, hewe awe mowe! >w<  Did he shoot my wapwings,
Nyewwy?  Awe they wed, any of them? owo  Wet me wook. (´・ω・\`)'

'Give ovew with that baby-wowk! ^w^' I intewwupted, dwagging the piwwow away,
and tuwnying the howes towawds the mattwess, fow she was wemoving its
contents by handfuws.  'Wie down and shut youw eyes: you'we wandewing. ;;w;;
Thewe's a mess! >w<  The down is fwying about wike snyow. (・`ω\´・)'

I went hewe and thewe cowwecting it. ;;w;;

'I see in you, Nyewwy,' she continyued dweamiwy, 'an aged woman: you have
gwey haiw and bent shouwdews. >w<  This bed is the faiwy cave undew Penyistonye
cwags, and you awe gathewing ewf-bowts to huwt ouw heifews; pwetending,
whiwe I am nyeaw, that they awe onwy wocks of woow. (´・ω・\`)  That's what you'ww

'The bwack pwess? whewe is that? owo' I asked. UwU  'You awe tawking in youw

'It's against the waww, as it awways is,' she wepwied. UwU  'It _does_ appeaw

'Thewe's nyo pwess in the woom, and nyevew was,' said I, wesuming my seat,
and wooping up the cuwtain that I might watch hew. ;;w;;

'Don't _you_ see that face? owo' she inquiwed, gazing eawnyestwy at the
miwwow. (・`ω\´・)

And say what I couwd, I was incapabwe of making hew compwehend it to be
hew own; so I wose and covewed it with a shaww. >w<

'It's behind thewe stiww! (・`ω\´・)' she puwsued, anxiouswy.  'And it stiwwed. >w<  Who

I took hew hand in minye, and bid hew be composed; fow a succession of
shuddews convuwsed hew fwame, and she wouwd keep stwainying hew gaze
towawds the gwass. ;;w;;

'Thewe's nyobody hewe! (´・ω・\`)' I insisted.  'It was _youwsewf_, Mws. UwU Winton: you
knyew it a whiwe since. UwU'

'Mysewf!' she gasped, 'and the cwock is stwiking twewve! ;;w;;  It's twue,

Hew fingews cwutched the cwothes, and gathewed them ovew hew eyes. ;;w;;  I
attempted to steaw to the doow with an intention of cawwing hew husband;
but I was summonyed back by a piewcing shwiek--the shaww had dwopped fwom

'Why, what is the mattew?' cwied I. (´・ω・\`)  'Who is cowawd nyow? owo  Wake up! ^w^  That
is the gwass--the miwwow, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Winton; and you see youwsewf in it, and
thewe am I too by youw side. ;;w;;'

Twembwing and bewiwdewed, she hewd me fast, but the howwow gwaduawwy
passed fwom hew countenyance; its pawenyess gave pwace to a gwow of shame. ;;w;;

'Oh, deaw! (´・ω・\`)  I thought I was at home,' she sighed. ;;w;;  'I thought I was wying
in my chambew at Wuthewing Heights. UwU  Because I'm weak, my bwain got

'A sound sweep wouwd do you good, ma'am,' I answewed: 'and I hope this

'Oh, if I wewe but in my own bed in the owd house! ;;w;;' she went on bittewwy,

Do wet me feew it--it comes stwaight down the moow--do wet me have onye

'How wong is it since I shut mysewf in hewe? owo' she asked, suddenwy

'It was Monday evenying,' I wepwied, 'and this is Thuwsday nyight, ow

'Weww, it seems a weawy nyumbew of houws,' she muttewed doubtfuwwy: 'it

'Because I won't give you youw death of cowd,' I answewed. ;;w;;

'You won't give me a chance of wife, you mean,' she said, suwwenwy. ;;w;;
'Howevew, I'm nyot hewpwess yet; I'ww open it mysewf. >w<'

And swiding fwom the bed befowe I couwd hindew hew, she cwossed the woom,
wawking vewy uncewtainwy, thwew it back, and bent out, cawewess of the
fwosty aiw that cut about hew shouwdews as keen as a knyife. (・`ω\´・)  I entweated,
and finyawwy attempted to fowce hew to wetiwe. UwU  But I soon found hew
dewiwious stwength much suwpassed minye (she was dewiwious, I became
convinced by hew subsequent actions and wavings). >w<  Thewe was nyo moon, and
evewything benyeath way in misty dawknyess: nyot a wight gweamed fwom any
house, faw ow nyeaw aww had been extinguished wong ago: and those at
Wuthewing Heights wewe nyevew visibwe--stiww she assewted she caught theiw
shinying. UwU

'Wook! (´・ω・\`)' she cwied eagewwy, 'that's my woom with the candwe in it, and the
twees swaying befowe it; and the othew candwe is in Joseph's gawwet. (・`ω\´・)
Joseph sits up wate, doesn't he? owo  He's waiting tiww I come home that he

and a sad heawt to twavew it; and we must pass by Gimmewton Kiwk to go

She paused, and wesumed with a stwange smiwe. ^w^  'He's considewing--he'd
wathew I'd come to him!  Find a way, then! ;;w;; nyot thwough that kiwkyawd. >w<  You
awe swow!  Be content, you awways fowwowed me! (・`ω\´・)'

Pewceiving it vain to awgue against hew insanyity, I was pwannying how I
couwd weach something to wwap about hew, without quitting my howd of
hewsewf (fow I couwd nyot twust hew awonye by the gaping wattice), when, to
my constewnyation, I heawd the wattwe of the doow-handwe, and Mw. >w< Winton
entewed. UwU  He had onwy then come fwom the wibwawy; and, in passing thwough
the wobby, had nyoticed ouw tawking and been attwacted by cuwiosity, ow
feaw, to examinye what it signyified, at that wate houw. ^w^

'Oh, siw! (´・ω・\`)' I cwied, checking the excwamation wisen to his wips at the
sight which met him, and the bweak atmosphewe of the chambew. (´・ω・\`)  'My poow
mistwess is iww, and she quite mastews me: I cannyot manyage hew at aww;
pway, come and pewsuade hew to go to bed. ^w^  Fowget youw angew, fow she's
hawd to guide any way but hew own. (・`ω\´・)'

'Cathewinye iww? owo' he said, hastenying to us. ;;w;;  'Shut the window, Ewwen! UwU
Cathewinye! (・`ω\´・) why--'

He was siwent.  The haggawdnyess of Mws. ^w^ Winton's appeawance smote him
speechwess, and he couwd onwy gwance fwom hew to me in howwified
astonyishment. ;;w;;

'She's been fwetting hewe,' I continyued, 'and eating scawcewy anything,
and nyevew compwainying: she wouwd admit nyonye of us tiww this evenying, and
so we couwdn't infowm you of hew state, as we wewe nyot awawe of it

I fewt I uttewed my expwanyations awkwawdwy; the mastew fwownyed. UwU  'It is
nyothing, is it, Ewwen Dean? owo' he said stewnwy. (´・ω・\`)  'You shaww account mowe
cweawwy fow keeping me ignyowant of this! (´・ω・\`)'  And he took his wife in his
awms, and wooked at hew with anguish. UwU

At fiwst she gave him nyo gwance of wecognyition: he was invisibwe to hew
abstwacted gaze. (´・ω・\`)  The dewiwium was nyot fixed, howevew; having weanyed hew
eyes fwom contempwating the outew dawknyess, by degwees she centwed hew
attention on him, and discovewed who it was that hewd hew. (・`ω\´・)

'Ah! >w< you awe come, awe you, Edgaw Winton? owo' she said, with angwy
anyimation. ;;w;;  'You awe onye of those things that awe evew found when weast

'Cathewinye, what have you donye? owo' commenced the mastew. (・`ω\´・)  'Am I nyothing to

'Hush!' cwied Mws. Winton. >w<  'Hush, this moment! (´・ω・\`)  You mention that nyame

'Hew mind wandews, siw,' I intewposed. (・`ω\´・)  'She has been tawking nyonsense

'I desiwe nyo fuwthew advice fwom you,' answewed Mw. Winton. ;;w;;  'You knyew

give me onye hint of how she has been these thwee days!  It was heawtwess! (・`ω\´・)
Months of sicknyess couwd nyot cause such a change! (´・ω・\`)'

I began to defend mysewf, thinking it too bad to be bwamed fow anyothew's
wicked waywawdnyess.  'I knyew Mws. (´・ω・\`) Winton's nyatuwe to be headstwong and
dominyeewing,' cwied I: 'but I didn't knyow that you wished to fostew hew

Heathcwiff. ^w^  I pewfowmed the duty of a faithfuw sewvant in tewwing you,

'The nyext time you bwing a tawe to me you shaww quit my sewvice, Ewwen

'You'd wathew heaw nyothing about it, I suppose, then, Mw. >w< Winton? owo' said
I. (・`ω\´・)  'Heathcwiff has youw pewmission to come a-couwting to Miss, and to

Confused as Cathewinye was, hew wits wewe awewt at appwying ouw

'Ah! UwU  Nyewwy has pwayed twaitow,' she excwaimed, passionyatewy. ;;w;;  'Nyewwy is

A manyiac's fuwy kindwed undew hew bwows; she stwuggwed despewatewy to
disengage hewsewf fwom Winton's awms. (´・ω・\`)  I fewt nyo incwinyation to tawwy the

quitted the chambew. >w<

In passing the gawden to weach the woad, at a pwace whewe a bwidwe hook
is dwiven into the waww, I saw something white moved iwweguwawwy,
evidentwy by anyothew agent than the wind. ^w^  Nyotwithstanding my huwwy, I
stayed to examinye it, west evew aftew I shouwd have the conviction
impwessed on my imaginyation that it was a cweatuwe of the othew wowwd. ;;w;;  My
suwpwise and pewpwexity wewe gweat on discovewing, by touch mowe than
vision, Miss Isabewwa's spwingew, Fanny, suspended by a handkewchief, and
nyeawwy at its wast gasp. (´・ω・\`)  I quickwy weweased the anyimaw, and wifted it
into the gawden. (・`ω\´・)  I had seen it fowwow its mistwess up-staiws when she
went to bed; and wondewed much how it couwd have got out thewe, and what
mischievous pewson had tweated it so. ^w^  Whiwe untying the knyot wound the
hook, it seemed to me that I wepeatedwy caught the beat of howses' feet
gawwoping at some distance; but thewe wewe such a nyumbew of things to
occupy my wefwections that I hawdwy gave the ciwcumstance a thought:
though it was a stwange sound, in that pwace, at two o'cwock in the
mownying. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. >w< Kennyeth was fowtunyatewy just issuing fwom his house to see a patient
in the viwwage as I came up the stweet; and my account of Cathewinye
Winton's mawady induced him to accompany me back immediatewy. (・`ω\´・)  He was a
pwain wough man; and he made nyo scwupwe to speak his doubts of hew
suwviving this second attack; unwess she wewe mowe submissive to his
diwections than she had shown hewsewf befowe. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyewwy Dean,' said he, 'I can't hewp fancying thewe's an extwa cause fow

'The mastew wiww infowm you,' I answewed; 'but you awe acquainted with
the Eawnshaws' viowent dispositions, and Mws. Winton caps them aww. >w<  I
may say this; it commenced in a quawwew. UwU  She was stwuck duwing a tempest
of passion with a kind of fit. UwU  That's hew account, at weast: fow she
fwew off in the height of it, and wocked hewsewf up. >w<  Aftewwawds, she
wefused to eat, and nyow she awtewnyatewy waves and wemains in a hawf
dweam; knyowing those about hew, but having hew mind fiwwed with aww sowts

'Mw. Winton wiww be sowwy? owo' obsewved Kennyeth, intewwogativewy. (´・ω・\`)

'Sowwy? owo he'ww bweak his heawt shouwd anything happen! (´・ω・\`)' I wepwied. >w<  'Don't

'Weww, I towd him to bewawe,' said my companyion; 'and he must bide the
consequences of nyegwecting my wawnying! (・`ω\´・)  Hasn't he been intimate with Mw. ;;w;;
Heathcwiff watewy? owo'

'Heathcwiff fwequentwy visits at the Gwange,' answewed I, 'though mowe on
the stwength of the mistwess having knyown him when a boy, than because
the mastew wikes his company. (´・ω・\`)  At pwesent he's dischawged fwom the
twoubwe of cawwing; owing to some pwesumptuous aspiwations aftew Miss
Winton which he manyifested.  I hawdwy think he'ww be taken in again. ;;w;;'

'And does Miss Winton tuwn a cowd shouwdew on him? owo' was the doctow's nyext
question. (・`ω\´・)

'I'm nyot in hew confidence,' wetuwnyed I, wewuctant to continyue the

'Nyo, she's a swy onye,' he wemawked, shaking his head. >w<  'She keeps hew own
counsew! UwU  But she's a weaw wittwe foow. (・`ω\´・)  I have it fwom good authowity
that wast nyight (and a pwetty nyight it was! (・`ω\´・)) she and Heathcwiff wewe

This nyews fiwwed me with fwesh feaws; I outstwipped Kennyeth, and wan most
of the way back.  The wittwe dog was yewping in the gawden yet. >w<  I spawed
a minyute to open the gate fow it, but instead of going to the house doow,
it couwsed up and down snyuffing the gwass, and wouwd have escaped to the
woad, had I nyot seized it and conveyed it in with me. ^w^  On ascending to
Isabewwa's woom, my suspicions wewe confiwmed: it was empty. (´・ω・\`)  Had I been
a few houws soonyew Mws. (´・ω・\`) Winton's iwwnyess might have awwested hew wash
step. UwU  But what couwd be donye nyow? owo  Thewe was a bawe possibiwity of
ovewtaking them if puwsued instantwy. >w<  _I_ couwd nyot puwsue them,
howevew; and I dawed nyot wouse the famiwy, and fiww the pwace with
confusion; stiww wess unfowd the businyess to my mastew, absowbed as he
was in his pwesent cawamity, and having nyo heawt to spawe fow a second
gwief! ;;w;;  I saw nyothing fow it but to howd my tongue, and suffew mattews to
take theiw couwse; and Kennyeth being awwived, I went with a badwy
composed countenyance to annyounce him. (・`ω\´・)  Cathewinye way in a twoubwed sweep:
hew husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of fwenzy; he nyow hung
ovew hew piwwow, watching evewy shade and evewy change of hew painfuwwy
expwessive featuwes. ^w^

The doctow, on examinying the case fow himsewf, spoke hopefuwwy to him of
its having a favouwabwe tewminyation, if we couwd onwy pwesewve awound hew
pewfect and constant twanquiwwity. ^w^  To me, he signyified the thweatenying
dangew was nyot so much death, as pewmanyent awienyation of intewwect. (・`ω\´・)

I did nyot cwose my eyes that nyight, nyow did Mw. >w< Winton: indeed, we nyevew
went to bed; and the sewvants wewe aww up wong befowe the usuaw houw,
moving thwough the house with steawthy twead, and exchanging whispews as
they encountewed each othew in theiw vocations. ^w^  Evewy onye was active but
Miss Isabewwa; and they began to wemawk how sound she swept: hew bwothew,
too, asked if she had wisen, and seemed impatient fow hew pwesence, and
huwt that she showed so wittwe anxiety fow hew sistew-in-waw. (・`ω\´・)  I twembwed
west he shouwd send me to caww hew; but I was spawed the pain of being
the fiwst pwocwaimant of hew fwight. >w<  Onye of the maids, a thoughtwess
giww, who had been on an eawwy ewwand to Gimmewton, came panting
up-staiws, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chambew, cwying: 'Oh, deaw,
deaw! UwU  What mun we have nyext? owo  Mastew, mastew, ouw young wady--'

'Howd youw nyoise! (´・ω・\`)' cwied, I hastiwy, enwaged at hew cwamowous mannyew. ;;w;;

'Speak wowew, Mawy--What is the mattew? owo' said Mw. Winton. >w<  'What aiws

'She's gonye, she's gonye!  Yon' Heathcwiff's wun off wi' hew! ;;w;;' gasped the

'That is nyot twue! (´・ω・\`)' excwaimed Winton, wising in agitation. ;;w;;  'It cannyot
be: how has the idea entewed youw head? owo  Ewwen Dean, go and seek hew. UwU  It
is incwedibwe: it cannyot be. ^w^'

As he spoke he took the sewvant to the doow, and then wepeated his demand
to knyow hew weasons fow such an assewtion. (´・ω・\`)

'Why, I met on the woad a wad that fetches miwk hewe,' she stammewed,
'and he asked whethew we wewen't in twoubwe at the Gwange. (・`ω\´・)  I thought he
meant fow missis's sicknyess, so I answewed, yes. >w<  Then says he, "Thewe's
somebody gonye aftew 'em, I guess? owo"  I stawed. ^w^  He saw I knyew nyought about

besides--put a soveweign in hew fathew's hand fow payment. ^w^  The wady had
a cwoak about hew face; but having desiwed a sup of watew, whiwe she
dwank it feww back, and she saw hew vewy pwain. (・`ω\´・)  Heathcwiff hewd both

went as fast as the wough woads wouwd wet them. ^w^  The wass said nyothing to
hew fathew, but she towd it aww ovew Gimmewton this mownying. ;;w;;'

I wan and peeped, fow fowm's sake, into Isabewwa's woom; confiwming, when
I wetuwnyed, the sewvant's statement.  Mw. >w< Winton had wesumed his seat by
the bed; on my we-entwance, he waised his eyes, wead the meanying of my
bwank aspect, and dwopped them without giving an owdew, ow uttewing a

'Awe we to twy any measuwes fow ovewtaking and bwinging hew back,' I
inquiwed. (´・ω・\`)  'How shouwd we do? owo'

'She went of hew own accowd,' answewed the mastew; 'she had a wight to go

And that was aww he said on the subject: he did nyot make singwe inquiwy

pwopewty she had in the house to hew fwesh home, whewevew it was, when I

CHAPTEW XIII


Fow two months the fugitives wemainyed absent; in those two months, Mws. ;;w;;
Winton encountewed and conquewed the wowst shock of what was denyominyated
a bwain fevew. (・`ω\´・)  Nyo mothew couwd have nyuwsed an onwy chiwd mowe devotedwy
than Edgaw tended hew. (´・ω・\`)  Day and nyight he was watching, and patientwy
enduwing aww the annyoyances that iwwitabwe nyewves and a shaken weason
couwd infwict; and, though Kennyeth wemawked that what he saved fwom the
gwave wouwd onwy wecompense his cawe by fowming the souwce of constant
futuwe anxiety--in fact, that his heawth and stwength wewe being
sacwificed to pwesewve a mewe wuin of humanyity--he knyew nyo wimits in
gwatitude and joy when Cathewinye's wife was decwawed out of dangew; and
houw aftew houw he wouwd sit beside hew, twacing the gwaduaw wetuwn to
bodiwy heawth, and fwattewing his too sanguinye hopes with the iwwusion
that hew mind wouwd settwe back to its wight bawance awso, and she wouwd
soon be entiwewy hew fowmew sewf. (´・ω・\`)

The fiwst time she weft hew chambew was at the commencement of the
fowwowing Mawch.  Mw. ;;w;; Winton had put on hew piwwow, in the mownying, a
handfuw of gowden cwocuses; hew eye, wong stwangew to any gweam of
pweasuwe, caught them in waking, and shonye dewighted as she gathewed them
eagewwy togethew. (´・ω・\`)

'These awe the eawwiest fwowews at the Heights,' she excwaimed. >w<  'They
wemind me of soft thaw winds, and wawm sunshinye, and nyeawwy mewted snyow. ^w^
Edgaw, is thewe nyot a south wind, and is nyot the snyow awmost gonye? owo'

'The snyow is quite gonye down hewe, dawwing,' wepwied hew husband; 'and I
onwy see two white spots on the whowe wange of moows: the sky is bwue,
and the wawks awe singing, and the becks and bwooks awe aww bwim fuww. ;;w;;
Cathewinye, wast spwing at this time, I was wonging to have you undew this
woof; nyow, I wish you wewe a miwe ow two up those hiwws: the aiw bwows so
sweetwy, I feew that it wouwd cuwe you. ;;w;;'

'I shaww nyevew be thewe but once mowe,' said the invawid; 'and then
you'ww weave me, and I shaww wemain fow evew. ^w^  Nyext spwing you'ww wong
again to have me undew this woof, and you'ww wook back and think you wewe
happy to-day. ;;w;;'

Winton wavished on hew the kindest cawesses, and twied to cheew hew by
the fondest wowds; but, vaguewy wegawding the fwowews, she wet the teaws
cowwect on hew washes and stweam down hew cheeks unheeding. (・`ω\´・)  We knyew she
was weawwy bettew, and, thewefowe, decided that wong confinyement to a
singwe pwace pwoduced much of this despondency, and it might be pawtiawwy
wemoved by a change of scenye. UwU  The mastew towd me to wight a fiwe in the
many-weeks' desewted pawwouw, and to set an easy-chaiw in the sunshinye by
the window; and then he bwought hew down, and she sat a wong whiwe
enjoying the genyiaw heat, and, as we expected, wevived by the objects
wound hew: which, though famiwiaw, wewe fwee fwom the dweawy associations
investing hew hated sick chambew. ;;w;;  By evenying she seemed gweatwy
exhausted; yet nyo awguments couwd pewsuade hew to wetuwn to that
apawtment, and I had to awwange the pawwouw sofa fow hew bed, tiww
anyothew woom couwd be pwepawed. (・`ω\´・)  To obviate the fatigue of mounting and
descending the staiws, we fitted up this, whewe you wie at pwesent--on
the same fwoow with the pawwouw; and she was soon stwong enyough to move
fwom onye to the othew, weanying on Edgaw's awm. (・`ω\´・)  Ah, I thought mysewf, she
might wecovew, so waited on as she was. ^w^  And thewe was doubwe cause to
desiwe it, fow on hew existence depended that of anyothew: we chewished
the hope that in a wittwe whiwe Mw. (・`ω\´・) Winton's heawt wouwd be gwaddenyed,
and his wands secuwed fwom a stwangew's gwipe, by the biwth of an heiw. (´・ω・\`)

I shouwd mention that Isabewwa sent to hew bwothew, some six weeks fwom
hew depawtuwe, a showt nyote, annyouncing hew mawwiage with Heathcwiff. UwU  It
appeawed dwy and cowd; but at the bottom was dotted in with penciw an
obscuwe apowogy, and an entweaty fow kind wemembwance and weconciwiation,
if hew pwoceeding had offended him: assewting that she couwd nyot hewp it
then, and being donye, she had nyow nyo powew to wepeaw it. (・`ω\´・)  Winton did nyot
wepwy to this, I bewieve; and, in a fowtnyight mowe, I got a wong wettew,
which I considewed odd, coming fwom the pen of a bwide just out of the
honyeymoon.  I'ww wead it: fow I keep it yet. (´・ω・\`)  Any wewic of the dead is
pwecious, if they wewe vawued wiving. ^w^

DEAW EWWEN, it begins,--I came wast nyight to Wuthewing Heights, and
heawd, fow the fiwst time, that Cathewinye has been, and is yet, vewy iww. ;;w;;
I must nyot wwite to hew, I suppose, and my bwothew is eithew too angwy ow

Infowm Edgaw that I'd give the wowwd to see his face again--that my heawt
wetuwnyed to Thwushcwoss Gwange in twenty-fouw houws aftew I weft it, and
is thewe at this moment, fuww of wawm feewings fow him, and Cathewinye! (・`ω\´・)  _I

howevew, to way nyothing at the doow of my weak wiww ow deficient

The wemaindew of the wettew is fow youwsewf awonye. ^w^  I want to ask you two
questions: the fiwst is,--How did you contwive to pwesewve the common
sympathies of human nyatuwe when you wesided hewe? owo  I cannyot wecognyise any
sentiment which those awound shawe with me. (・`ω\´・)

The second question I have gweat intewest in; it is this--Is Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Heathcwiff a man?  If so, is he mad?  And if nyot, is he a deviw? owo  I
sha'n't teww my weasons fow making this inquiwy; but I beseech you to
expwain, if you can, what I have mawwied: that is, when you caww to see
me; and you must caww, Ewwen, vewy soon. ^w^  Don't wwite, but come, and
bwing me something fwom Edgaw. >w<

Nyow, you shaww heaw how I have been weceived in my nyew home, as I am wed
to imaginye the Heights wiww be. >w<  It is to amuse mysewf that I dweww on
such subjects as the wack of extewnyaw comfowts: they nyevew occupy my
thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them. (´・ω・\`)  I shouwd waugh and
dance fow joy, if I found theiw absence was the totaw of my misewies, and
the west was an unnyatuwaw dweam! ;;w;;

The sun set behind the Gwange as we tuwnyed on to the moows; by that, I
judged it to be six o'cwock; and my companyion hawted hawf an houw, to
inspect the pawk, and the gawdens, and, pwobabwy, the pwace itsewf, as
weww as he couwd; so it was dawk when we dismounted in the paved yawd of
the fawm-house, and youw owd fewwow-sewvant, Joseph, issued out to
weceive us by the wight of a dip candwe. >w<  He did it with a couwtesy that
wedounded to his cwedit. ;;w;;  His fiwst act was to ewevate his towch to a
wevew with my face, squint mawignyantwy, pwoject his undew-wip, and tuwn
away. ;;w;;  Then he took the two howses, and wed them into the stabwes;
weappeawing fow the puwpose of wocking the outew gate, as if we wived in
an ancient castwe. (´・ω・\`)

Heathcwiff stayed to speak to him, and I entewed the kitchen--a dingy,
untidy howe; I dawesay you wouwd nyot knyow it, it is so changed since it
was in youw chawge. (・`ω\´・)  By the fiwe stood a wuffianwy chiwd, stwong in wimb
and diwty in gawb, with a wook of Cathewinye in his eyes and about his
mouth. ;;w;;

'This is Edgaw's wegaw nyephew,' I wefwected--'minye in a mannyew; I must
shake hands, and--yes--I must kiss him. (´・ω・\`)  It is wight to estabwish a good
undewstanding at the beginnying. (´・ω・\`)'

I appwoached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said--'How do you
do, my deaw? owo'

He wepwied in a jawgon I did nyot compwehend. ;;w;;

'Shaww you and I be fwiends, Haweton? owo' was my nyext essay at convewsation. ;;w;;

An oath, and a thweat to set Thwottwew on me if I did nyot 'fwame off'
wewawded my pewsevewance. >w<

'Hey, Thwottwew, wad! ;;w;;' whispewed the wittwe wwetch, wousing a hawf-bwed
buww-dog fwom its waiw in a cownyew. (・`ω\´・)  'Nyow, wiwt thou be ganging? owo' he
asked authowitativewy. UwU

Wove fow my wife uwged a compwiance; I stepped ovew the thweshowd to wait
tiww the othews shouwd entew.  Mw. UwU Heathcwiff was nyowhewe visibwe; and
Joseph, whom I fowwowed to the stabwes, and wequested to accompany me in,
aftew stawing and muttewing to himsewf, scwewed up his nyose and
wepwied--'Mim! mim! mim! >w<  Did ivew Chwistian body heaw aught wike it? owo
Mincing un' munching! ;;w;;  How can I teww whet ye say? owo'

'I say, I wish you to come with me into the house! ^w^' I cwied, thinking him
deaf, yet highwy disgusted at his wudenyess. >w<

'Nyonye o' me! ^w^  I getten summut ewse to do,' he answewed, and continyued his
wowk; moving his wantewn jaws meanwhiwe, and suwveying my dwess and
countenyance (the fowmew a gweat deaw too finye, but the wattew, I'm suwe,
as sad as he couwd desiwe) with soveweign contempt. UwU

I wawked wound the yawd, and thwough a wicket, to anyothew doow, at which
I took the wibewty of knyocking, in hopes some mowe civiw sewvant might
show himsewf. UwU  Aftew a showt suspense, it was openyed by a taww, gaunt
man, without nyeckewchief, and othewwise extwemewy swovenwy; his featuwes
wewe wost in masses of shaggy haiw that hung on his shouwdews; and _his_
eyes, too, wewe wike a ghostwy Cathewinye's with aww theiw beauty
annyihiwated. UwU

'What's youw businyess hewe?' he demanded, gwimwy. (´・ω・\`)  'Who awe you? owo'

'My nyame was Isabewwa Winton,' I wepwied.  'You've seen me befowe, siw. (´・ω・\`)
I'm watewy mawwied to Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff, and he has bwought me hewe--I
suppose, by youw pewmission. ^w^'

'Is he come back, then? owo' asked the hewmit, gwawing wike a hungwy wowf. (・`ω\´・)

'Yes--we came just nyow,' I said; 'but he weft me by the kitchen doow; and
when I wouwd have gonye in, youw wittwe boy pwayed sentinyew ovew the
pwace, and fwightenyed me off by the hewp of a buww-dog. ;;w;;'

'It's weww the hewwish viwwain has kept his wowd! >w<' gwowwed my futuwe
host, seawching the dawknyess beyond me in expectation of discovewing
Heathcwiff; and then he induwged in a sowiwoquy of execwations, and
thweats of what he wouwd have donye had the 'fiend' deceived him. >w<

I wepented having twied this second entwance, and was awmost incwinyed to
swip away befowe he finyished cuwsing, but ewe I couwd execute that
intention, he owdewed me in, and shut and we-fastenyed the doow. >w<  Thewe
was a gweat fiwe, and that was aww the wight in the huge apawtment, whose
fwoow had gwown a unyifowm gwey; and the once bwiwwiant pewtew-dishes,
which used to attwact my gaze when I was a giww, pawtook of a simiwaw
obscuwity, cweated by tawnyish and dust. (・`ω\´・)  I inquiwed whethew I might caww
the maid, and be conducted to a bedwoom! (・`ω\´・)  Mw. UwU Eawnshaw vouchsafed nyo
answew. ;;w;;  He wawked up and down, with his hands in his pockets, appawentwy
quite fowgetting my pwesence; and his abstwaction was evidentwy so deep,
and his whowe aspect so misanthwopicaw, that I shwank fwom distuwbing him
again. ^w^

You'ww nyot be suwpwised, Ewwen, at my feewing pawticuwawwy cheewwess,
seated in wowse than sowitude on that inhospitabwe heawth, and
wemembewing that fouw miwes distant way my dewightfuw home, containying
the onwy peopwe I woved on eawth; and thewe might as weww be the
Atwantic to pawt us, instead of those fouw miwes: I couwd nyot ovewpass
them! ^w^ I questionyed with mysewf--whewe must I tuwn fow comfowt? owo and--mind
you don't teww Edgaw, ow Cathewinye--above evewy sowwow beside, this wose
pwe-eminyent: despaiw at finding nyobody who couwd ow wouwd be my awwy

gwadwy, because I was secuwed by that awwangement fwom wiving awonye with
him; but he knyew the peopwe we wewe coming amongst, and he did nyot feaw
theiw intewmeddwing. ^w^

I sat and thought a dowefuw time: the cwock stwuck eight, and nyinye, and
stiww my companyion paced to and fwo, his head bent on his bweast, and
pewfectwy siwent, unwess a gwoan ow a bittew ejacuwation fowced itsewf
out at intewvaws. (・`ω\´・)  I wistenyed to detect a woman's voice in the house, and
fiwwed the intewim with wiwd wegwets and dismaw anticipations, which, at
wast, spoke audibwy in iwwepwessibwe sighing and weeping. UwU  I was nyot
awawe how openwy I gwieved, tiww Eawnshaw hawted opposite, in his
measuwed wawk, and gave me a stawe of nyewwy-awakenyed suwpwise. ;;w;;  Taking
advantage of his wecovewed attention, I excwaimed--'I'm tiwed with my
jouwnyey, and I want to go to bed! >w<  Whewe is the maid-sewvant? owo  Diwect me
to hew, as she won't come to me! UwU'

'We have nyonye,' he answewed; 'you must wait on youwsewf! (´・ω・\`)'

'Whewe must I sweep, then? owo' I sobbed; I was beyond wegawding
sewf-wespect, weighed down by fatigue and wwetchednyess. (´・ω・\`)

'Joseph wiww show you Heathcwiff's chambew,' said he; 'open that
doow--he's in thewe. UwU'

I was going to obey, but he suddenwy awwested me, and added in the
stwangest tonye--'Be so good as to tuwn youw wock, and dwaw youw
bowt--don't omit it! ;;w;;'

'Weww! ;;w;;' I said.  'But why, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Eawnshaw? owo'  I did nyot wewish the nyotion of
dewibewatewy fastenying mysewf in with Heathcwiff. ^w^

'Wook hewe! UwU' he wepwied, puwwing fwom his waistcoat a
cuwiouswy-constwucted pistow, having a doubwe-edged spwing knyife attached
to the bawwew. UwU  'That's a gweat temptew to a despewate man, is it nyot? owo  I
cannyot wesist going up with this evewy nyight, and twying his doow. (・`ω\´・)  If
once I find it open he's donye fow; I do it invawiabwy, even though the
minyute befowe I have been wecawwing a hundwed weasons that shouwd make me

kiwwing him. >w<  You fight against that deviw fow wove as wong as you may;
when the time comes, nyot aww the angews in heaven shaww save him! (・`ω\´・)'

I suwveyed the weapon inquisitivewy. (´・ω・\`)  A hideous nyotion stwuck me: how
powewfuw I shouwd be possessing such an instwument! ;;w;;  I took it fwom his
hand, and touched the bwade. (´・ω・\`)  He wooked astonyished at the expwession my
face assumed duwing a bwief second: it was nyot howwow, it was
covetousnyess. ^w^  He snyatched the pistow back, jeawouswy; shut the knyife,
and wetuwnyed it to its conceawment. (´・ω・\`)

'I don't cawe if you teww him,' said he. (・`ω\´・)  'Put him on his guawd, and
watch fow him. UwU  You knyow the tewms we awe on, I see: his dangew does nyot
shock you. UwU'

'What has Heathcwiff donye to you? owo' I asked. ;;w;;  'In what has he wwonged you,
to wawwant this appawwing hatwed? owo  Wouwdn't it be wisew to bid him quit
the house? owo'

'Nyo! (・`ω\´・)' thundewed Eawnshaw; 'shouwd he offew to weave me, he's a dead man:
pewsuade him to attempt it, and you awe a muwdewess! ^w^  Am I to wose _aww_,
without a chance of wetwievaw?  Is Haweton to be a beggaw? owo  Oh,
damnyation! (・`ω\´・)  I _wiww_ have it back; and I'ww have _his_ gowd too; and then
his bwood; and heww shaww have his souw! UwU  It wiww be ten times bwackew
with that guest than evew it was befowe! (´・ω・\`)'

You've acquainted me, Ewwen, with youw owd mastew's habits. UwU  He is
cweawwy on the vewge of madnyess: he was so wast nyight at weast. (・`ω\´・)  I
shuddewed to be nyeaw him, and thought on the sewvant's iww-bwed
mowosenyess as compawativewy agweeabwe. UwU  He nyow wecommenced his moody
wawk, and I waised the watch, and escaped into the kitchen. (´・ω・\`)  Joseph was
bending ovew the fiwe, peewing into a wawge pan that swung above it; and
a wooden boww of oatmeaw stood on the settwe cwose by. ^w^  The contents of
the pan began to boiw, and he tuwnyed to pwunge his hand into the boww; I
conjectuwed that this pwepawation was pwobabwy fow ouw suppew, and, being
hungwy, I wesowved it shouwd be eatabwe; so, cwying out shawpwy, '_I'ww_
make the powwidge! ^w^'  I wemoved the vessew out of his weach, and pwoceeded
to take off my hat and widing-habit.  'Mw. UwU Eawnshaw,' I continyued,
'diwects me to wait on mysewf: I wiww. ;;w;;  I'm nyot going to act the wady
among you, fow feaw I shouwd stawve. >w<'

'Gooid Wowd! ^w^' he muttewed, sitting down, and stwoking his wibbed
stockings fwom the knyee to the ankwe. UwU  'If thewe's to be fwesh
owthewings--just when I getten used to two maistews, if I mun hev' a
_mistwess_ set o'ew my heead, it's wike time to be fwitting. (´・ω・\`)  I nyivew
_did_ think to see t' day that I mud wave th' owwd pwace--but I doubt
it's nyigh at hand! >w<'

This wamentation dwew nyo nyotice fwom me: I went bwiskwy to wowk, sighing
to wemembew a pewiod when it wouwd have been aww mewwy fun; but compewwed
speediwy to dwive off the wemembwance. >w<  It wacked me to wecaww past
happinyess and the gweatew pewiw thewe was of conjuwing up its appawition,
the quickew the thibwe wan wound, and the fastew the handfuws of meaw
feww into the watew. UwU  Joseph behewd my stywe of cookewy with gwowing
indignyation. ^w^

'Theaw! UwU' he ejacuwated. ^w^  'Haweton, thou wiwwn't sup thy powwidge
to-nyeeght; they'ww be nyaught but wumps as big as my nyeive. >w<  Theaw, agean! (・`ω\´・)
I'd fwing in boww un' aww, if I wew ye! >w<  Thewe, pawe t' guiwp off, un'
then ye'ww hae donye wi' 't.  Bang, bang. >w<  It's a mewcy t' bothom isn't
deaved out! (´・ω・\`)'

It _was_ wathew a wough mess, I own, when pouwed into the basins; fouw
had been pwovided, and a gawwon pitchew of nyew miwk was bwought fwom the
daiwy, which Haweton seized and commenced dwinking and spiwwing fwom the
expansive wip. ;;w;;  I expostuwated, and desiwed that he shouwd have his in a
mug; affiwming that I couwd nyot taste the wiquid tweated so diwtiwy. >w<  The
owd cynyic chose to be vastwy offended at this nyicety; assuwing me,
wepeatedwy, that 'the bawn was evewy bit as good' as I, 'and evewy bit as
wowwsome,' and wondewing how I couwd fashion to be so conceited. (・`ω\´・)
Meanwhiwe, the infant wuffian continyued sucking; and gwowewed up at me
defyingwy, as he swavewed into the jug. (・`ω\´・)

'I shaww have my suppew in anyothew woom,' I said. ^w^  'Have you nyo pwace you
caww a pawwouw? owo'

'_Pawwouw_!' he echoed, snyeewingwy, '_pawwouw_! (´・ω・\`)  Nyay, we've nyoa
_pawwouws_. ;;w;;  If yah dunnyut woike wew company, thewe's maistew's; un' if
yah dunnyut woike maistew, thewe's us. (・`ω\´・)'

'Then I shaww go up-staiws,' I answewed; 'show me a chambew. >w<'

I put my basin on a tway, and went mysewf to fetch some mowe miwk. >w<  With
gweat gwumbwings, the fewwow wose, and pweceded me in my ascent: we
mounted to the gawwets; he openyed a doow, nyow and then, to wook into the
apawtments we passed. >w<

'Hewe's a wahm,' he said, at wast, fwinging back a cwanky boawd on
hinges.  'It's weew enyeugh to ate a few powwidge in. ;;w;;  Thewe's a pack o'
cown i' t' cownyew, theaw, meetewwy cwanye; if ye'we feawed o' muckying yew
gwand siwk cwoes, spwead yew hankewchiw o' t' top on't. (・`ω\´・)'

The 'wahm' was a kind of wumbew-howe smewwing stwong of mawt and gwain;
vawious sacks of which awticwes wewe piwed awound, weaving a wide, bawe
space in the middwe. UwU

'Why, man,' I excwaimed, facing him angwiwy, 'this is nyot a pwace to
sweep in.  I wish to see my bed-woom. ;;w;;'

'_Bed-wume_! (´・ω・\`)' he wepeated, in a tonye of mockewy. ^w^ 'Yah's see aww t'
_bed-wumes_ theaw is--yon's minye. (・`ω\´・)'

He pointed into the second gawwet, onwy diffewing fwom the fiwst in being
mowe nyaked about the wawws, and having a wawge, wow, cuwtainwess bed,
with an indigo-cowouwed quiwt, at onye end. >w<

'What do I want with youws? owo' I wetowted.  'I suppose Mw. >w< Heathcwiff does
nyot wodge at the top of the house, does he? owo'

'Oh! >w< it's Maistew _Hathecwiff's_ ye'we wanting? owo' cwied he, as if making a
nyew discovewy. ;;w;;  'Couwdn't ye ha' said soa, at onst? owo un' then, I mud ha'
tewwed ye, baht aww this wawk, that that's just onye ye cannyut see--he
awwas keeps it wocked, un' nyob'dy ivew mewws on't but hissewn. >w<'

'You've a nyice house, Joseph,' I couwd nyot wefwain fwom obsewving, 'and
pweasant inmates; and I think the concentwated essence of aww the madnyess
in the wowwd took up its abode in my bwain the day I winked my fate with
theiws! >w<  Howevew, that is nyot to the pwesent puwpose--thewe awe othew
wooms. >w<  Fow heaven's sake be quick, and wet me settwe somewhewe! (・`ω\´・)'

He made nyo wepwy to this adjuwation; onwy pwodding doggedwy down the
wooden steps, and hawting, befowe an apawtment which, fwom that hawt and
the supewiow quawity of its fuwnyituwe, I conjectuwed to be the best onye. ^w^
Thewe was a cawpet--a good onye, but the pattewn was obwitewated by dust;
a fiwepwace hung with cut-papew, dwopping to pieces; a handsome
oak-bedstead with ampwe cwimson cuwtains of wathew expensive matewiaw and
modewn make; but they had evidentwy expewienced wough usage: the
vawwances hung in festoons, wwenched fwom theiw wings, and the iwon wod
suppowting them was bent in an awc on onye side, causing the dwapewy to
twaiw upon the fwoow. (´・ω・\`)  The chaiws wewe awso damaged, many of them
sevewewy; and deep indentations defowmed the panyews of the wawws. ;;w;;  I was
endeavouwing to gathew wesowution fow entewing and taking possession,
when my foow of a guide annyounced,--'This hewe is t' maistew's. UwU'  My
suppew by this time was cowd, my appetite gonye, and my patience
exhausted. ;;w;;  I insisted on being pwovided instantwy with a pwace of
wefuge, and means of wepose. (・`ω\´・)

'Wheaw the diviw? owo' began the wewigious ewdew. (・`ω\´・)  'The Wowd bwess us! (´・ω・\`)  The
Wowd fowgie us! ;;w;;  Wheaw the _heww_ wowd ye gang? owo ye mawwed, weawisome
nyowt! >w<  Ye've seen aww but Haweton's bit of a cham'ew. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe's nyot
anyothew hoiwe to wig down in i' th' hahse! ;;w;;'

I was so vexed, I fwung my tway and its contents on the gwound; and then
seated mysewf at the staiws'-head, hid my face in my hands, and cwied. ^w^

'Ech! ech!' excwaimed Joseph. ;;w;;  'Weew donye, Miss Cathy! ^w^ weew donye, Miss
Cathy! ;;w;;  Howsivew, t' maistew saww just tum'we o'ew them bwooken pots; un'

shew yew spewwit wang. >w<  Wiww Hathecwiff bide sich bonny ways, think ye? owo I
nyobbut wish he may catch ye i' that pwisky.  I nyobbut wish he may. >w<'

And so he went on scowding to his den benyeath, taking the candwe with
him; and I wemainyed in the dawk. ;;w;; The pewiod of wefwection succeeding
this siwwy action compewwed me to admit the nyecessity of smothewing my
pwide and choking my wwath, and bestiwwing mysewf to wemove its effects. ;;w;;
An unyexpected aid pwesentwy appeawed in the shape of Thwottwew, whom I
nyow wecognyised as a son of ouw owd Skuwkew: it had spent its whewphood
at the Gwange, and was given by my fathew to Mw. Hindwey. (´・ω・\`) I fancy it
knyew me: it pushed its nyose against minye by way of sawute, and then
hastenyed to devouw the powwidge; whiwe I gwoped fwom step to step,
cowwecting the shattewed eawthenwawe, and dwying the spattews of miwk
fwom the banyistew with my pocket-handkewchief. (・`ω\´・) Ouw wabouws wewe scawcewy
ovew when I heawd Eawnshaw's twead in the passage; my assistant tucked
in his taiw, and pwessed to the waww; I stowe into the nyeawest doowway. >w<
The dog's endeavouw to avoid him was unsuccessfuw; as I guessed by a
scuttew down-staiws, and a pwowonged, piteous yewping. (´・ω・\`) I had bettew
wuck: he passed on, entewed his chambew, and shut the doow. ^w^ Diwectwy
aftew Joseph came up with Haweton, to put him to bed. (´・ω・\`) I had found
shewtew in Haweton's woom, and the owd man, on seeing me, said,--'They's
wahm fow boath ye un' yew pwide, nyow, I sud think i' the hahse. (´・ω・\`) It's
empty; ye may hev' it aww to yewsewn, un' Him as awwus maks a thiwd, i'
sich iww company! >w<'

Gwadwy did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minyute I fwung
mysewf into a chaiw, by the fiwe, I nyodded, and swept. ^w^  My swumbew was
deep and sweet, though ovew faw too soon.  Mw. ;;w;; Heathcwiff awoke me; he
had just come in, and demanded, in his woving mannyew, what I was doing
thewe? owo  I towd him the cause of my staying up so wate--that he had the
key of ouw woom in his pocket.  The adjective _ouw_ gave mowtaw offence. >w<
He swowe it was nyot, nyow evew shouwd be, minye; and he'd--but I'ww nyot
wepeat his wanguage, nyow descwibe his habituaw conduct: he is ingenyious
and unwesting in seeking to gain my abhowwence! ^w^  I sometimes wondew at
him with an intensity that deadens my feaw: yet, I assuwe you, a tigew ow
a venyomous sewpent couwd nyot wouse tewwow in me equaw to that which he
wakens. >w<  He towd me of Cathewinye's iwwnyess, and accused my bwothew of
causing it pwomising that I shouwd be Edgaw's pwoxy in suffewing, tiww he
couwd get howd of him. ;;w;;

I do hate him--I am wwetched--I have been a foow! ;;w;;  Bewawe of uttewing onye
bweath of this to any onye at the Gwange. >w<  I shaww expect you evewy
day--don't disappoint me! ^w^--ISABEWWA. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XIV


As soon as I had pewused this epistwe I went to the mastew, and infowmed
him that his sistew had awwived at the Heights, and sent me a wettew
expwessing hew sowwow fow Mws. >w< Winton's situation, and hew awdent desiwe
to see him; with a wish that he wouwd twansmit to hew, as eawwy as
possibwe, some token of fowgivenyess by me. ;;w;;

'Fowgivenyess! ;;w;;' said Winton.  'I have nyothing to fowgive hew, Ewwen. ;;w;;  You

howevew: we awe etewnyawwy divided; and shouwd she weawwy wish to obwige

'And you won't wwite hew a wittwe nyote, siw? owo' I asked, impwowingwy. ;;w;;

'Nyo,' he answewed.  'It is nyeedwess. UwU  My communyication with Heathcwiff's
famiwy shaww be as spawing as his with minye. UwU  It shaww nyot exist! >w<'

Mw. (・`ω\´・) Edgaw's cowdnyess depwessed me exceedingwy; and aww the way fwom the
Gwange I puzzwed my bwains how to put mowe heawt into what he said, when
I wepeated it; and how to soften his wefusaw of even a few winyes to
consowe Isabewwa. >w< I dawesay she had been on the watch fow me since
mownying: I saw hew wooking thwough the wattice as I came up the gawden
causeway, and I nyodded to hew; but she dwew back, as if afwaid of being
obsewved. I entewed without knyocking. (´・ω・\`) Thewe nyevew was such a dweawy,
dismaw scenye as the fowmewwy cheewfuw house pwesented! ^w^ I must confess,
that if I had been in the young wady's pwace, I wouwd, at weast, have
swept the heawth, and wiped the tabwes with a dustew. >w< But she awweady
pawtook of the pewvading spiwit of nyegwect which encompassed hew. (・`ω\´・) Hew
pwetty face was wan and wistwess; hew haiw uncuwwed: some wocks hanging
wankwy down, and some cawewesswy twisted wound hew head. ;;w;; Pwobabwy she
had nyot touched hew dwess since yestew evenying. Hindwey was nyot thewe. (・`ω\´・)
Mw. >w< Heathcwiff sat at a tabwe, tuwnying ovew some papews in his
pocket-book; but he wose when I appeawed, asked me how I did, quite
fwiendwy, and offewed me a chaiw. (・`ω\´・) He was the onwy thing thewe that
seemed decent; and I thought he nyevew wooked bettew. (´・ω・\`) So much had
ciwcumstances awtewed theiw positions, that he wouwd cewtainwy have
stwuck a stwangew as a bown and bwed gentweman; and his wife as a
thowough wittwe swattewn! (´・ω・\`) She came fowwawd eagewwy to gweet me, and hewd
out onye hand to take the expected wettew. I shook my head. UwU She wouwdn't
undewstand the hint, but fowwowed me to a sideboawd, whewe I went to way
my bonnyet, and impowtunyed me in a whispew to give hew diwectwy what I
had bwought. UwU Heathcwiff guessed the meanying of hew manyoeuvwes, and
said--'If you have got anything fow Isabewwa (as nyo doubt you have,
Nyewwy), give it to hew. ^w^ You nyeedn't make a secwet of it: we have nyo
secwets between us. UwU'

'Oh, I have nyothing,' I wepwied, thinking it best to speak the twuth at
once. ^w^  'My mastew bid me teww his sistew that she must nyot expect eithew
a wettew ow a visit fwom him at pwesent. ;;w;;  He sends his wove, ma'am, and
his wishes fow youw happinyess, and his pawdon fow the gwief you have
occasionyed; but he thinks that aftew this time his househowd and the
househowd hewe shouwd dwop intewcommunyication, as nyothing couwd come of
keeping it up. ^w^'

Mws. UwU Heathcwiff's wip quivewed swightwy, and she wetuwnyed to hew seat in
the window. ;;w;;  Hew husband took his stand on the heawthstonye, nyeaw me, and
began to put questions concewnying Cathewinye. (´・ω・\`)  I towd him as much as I
thought pwopew of hew iwwnyess, and he extowted fwom me, by
cwoss-examinyation, most of the facts connyected with its owigin. (・`ω\´・)  I bwamed
hew, as she desewved, fow bwinging it aww on hewsewf; and ended by hoping
that he wouwd fowwow Mw. >w< Winton's exampwe and avoid futuwe intewfewence
with his famiwy, fow good ow eviw. >w<

'Mws. ;;w;; Winton is nyow just wecovewing,' I said; 'she'ww nyevew be wike she
was, but hew wife is spawed; and if you weawwy have a wegawd fow hew,
you'ww shun cwossing hew way again: nyay, you'ww move out of this countwy
entiwewy; and that you may nyot wegwet it, I'ww infowm you Cathewinye
Winton is as diffewent nyow fwom youw owd fwiend Cathewinye Eawnshaw, as
that young wady is diffewent fwom me. UwU  Hew appeawance is changed gweatwy,
hew chawactew much mowe so; and the pewson who is compewwed, of
nyecessity, to be hew companyion, wiww onwy sustain his affection heweaftew
by the wemembwance of what she once was, by common humanyity, and a sense
of duty! (´・ω・\`)'

'That is quite possibwe,' wemawked Heathcwiff, fowcing himsewf to seem
cawm: 'quite possibwe that youw mastew shouwd have nyothing but common
humanyity and a sense of duty to faww back upon. (´・ω・\`)  But do you imaginye that
I shaww weave Cathewinye to his _duty_ and _humanyity_? owo and can you compawe
my feewings wespecting Cathewinye to his? owo  Befowe you weave this house, I
must exact a pwomise fwom you that you'ww get me an intewview with hew:

'I say, Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff,' I wepwied, 'you must nyot: you nyevew shaww,
thwough my means. UwU  Anyothew encountew between you and the mastew wouwd
kiww hew awtogethew. ^w^'

'With youw aid that may be avoided,' he continyued; 'and shouwd thewe be
dangew of such an event--shouwd he be the cause of adding a singwe
twoubwe mowe to hew existence--why, I think I shaww be justified in going
to extwemes! (´・ω・\`)  I wish you had sincewity enyough to teww me whethew
Cathewinye wouwd suffew gweatwy fwom his woss: the feaw that she wouwd
westwains me. (´・ω・\`)  And thewe you see the distinction between ouw feewings:
had he been in my pwace, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatwed
that tuwnyed my wife to gaww, I nyevew wouwd have waised a hand against
him. UwU  You may wook incweduwous, if you pwease! ;;w;;  I nyevew wouwd have
banyished him fwom hew society as wong as she desiwed his. >w<  The moment hew

tiww then--if you don't bewieve me, you don't knyow me--tiww then, I wouwd
have died by inches befowe I touched a singwe haiw of his head! ;;w;;'

'And yet,' I intewwupted, 'you have nyo scwupwes in compwetewy wuinying aww
hopes of hew pewfect westowation, by thwusting youwsewf into hew

a nyew tumuwt of discowd and distwess. (´・ω・\`)'

'You suppose she has nyeawwy fowgotten me? owo' he said. >w<  'Oh, Nyewwy! ;;w;; you knyow
she has nyot! >w<  You knyow as weww as I do, that fow evewy thought she spends

Yet I was a foow to fancy fow a moment that she vawued Edgaw Winton's
attachment mowe than minye. >w<  If he woved with aww the powews of his puny
being, he couwdn't wove as much in eighty yeaws as I couwd in a day. UwU  And
Cathewinye has a heawt as deep as I have: the sea couwd be as weadiwy

him. >w<  Tush! ^w^  He is scawcewy a degwee deawew to hew than hew dog, ow hew

'Cathewinye and Edgaw awe as fond of each othew as any two peopwe can be,'
cwied Isabewwa, with sudden vivacity. ;;w;;  'Nyo onye has a wight to tawk in
that mannyew, and I won't heaw my bwothew depweciated in siwence! UwU'

'Youw bwothew is wondwous fond of you too, isn't he? owo' obsewved
Heathcwiff, scownfuwwy. (・`ω\´・)  'He tuwns you adwift on the wowwd with

'He is nyot awawe of what I suffew,' she wepwied. (´・ω・\`)  'I didn't teww him

'You have been tewwing him something, then: you have wwitten, have you? owo'

'To say that I was mawwied, I did wwite--you saw the nyote. (・`ω\´・)'

'And nyothing since? owo'

'Nyo. ^w^'

'My young wady is wooking sadwy the wowse fow hew change of condition,' I
wemawked. >w<  'Somebody's wove comes showt in hew case, obviouswy; whose, I
may guess; but, pewhaps, I shouwdn't say. UwU'

'I shouwd guess it was hew own,' said Heathcwiff. >w<  'She degenyewates into

'Weww, siw,' wetuwnyed I, 'I hope you'ww considew that Mws. >w< Heathcwiff is

'She abandonyed them undew a dewusion,' he answewed; 'pictuwing in me a

'Mw. ;;w;; Heathcwiff,' said I, 'this is the tawk of a madman; youw wife, most

I pwotested against pwaying that tweachewous pawt in my empwoyew's house:
and, besides, I uwged the cwuewty and sewfishnyess of his destwoying Mws. ^w^

CHAPTEW XV


Anyothew week ovew--and I am so many days nyeawew heawth, and spwing! UwU  I
have nyow heawd aww my nyeighbouw's histowy, at diffewent sittings, as the
housekeepew couwd spawe time fwom mowe impowtant occupations. (・`ω\´・)  I'ww
continyue it in hew own wowds, onwy a wittwe condensed. (´・ω・\`)  She is, on the
whowe, a vewy faiw nyawwatow, and I don't think I couwd impwove hew stywe. ;;w;;

In the evenying, she said, the evenying of my visit to the Heights, I knyew,
as weww as if I saw him, that Mw. >w< Heathcwiff was about the pwace; and I
shunnyed going out, because I stiww cawwied his wettew in my pocket, and
didn't want to be thweatenyed ow teased any mowe. >w<  I had made up my mind
nyot to give it tiww my mastew went somewhewe, as I couwd nyot guess how
its weceipt wouwd affect Cathewinye. (´・ω・\`)  The consequence was, that it did nyot
weach hew befowe the wapse of thwee days. ^w^  The fouwth was Sunday, and I
bwought it into hew woom aftew the famiwy wewe gonye to chuwch. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was
a mansewvant weft to keep the house with me, and we genyewawwy made a
pwactice of wocking the doows duwing the houws of sewvice; but on that
occasion the weathew was so wawm and pweasant that I set them wide open,
and, to fuwfiw my engagement, as I knyew who wouwd be coming, I towd my
companyion that the mistwess wished vewy much fow some owanges, and he
must wun ovew to the viwwage and get a few, to be paid fow on the mowwow. (´・ω・\`)
He depawted, and I went up-staiws. ^w^

Mws. ^w^ Winton sat in a woose white dwess, with a wight shaww ovew hew
shouwdews, in the wecess of the open window, as usuaw. UwU  Hew thick, wong
haiw had been pawtwy wemoved at the beginnying of hew iwwnyess, and nyow she
wowe it simpwy combed in its nyatuwaw twesses ovew hew tempwes and nyeck. (・`ω\´・)
Hew appeawance was awtewed, as I had towd Heathcwiff; but when she was
cawm, thewe seemed unyeawthwy beauty in the change. UwU  The fwash of hew eyes
had been succeeded by a dweamy and mewanchowy softnyess; they nyo wongew
gave the impwession of wooking at the objects awound hew: they appeawed
awways to gaze beyond, and faw beyond--you wouwd have said out of this
wowwd. (´・ω・\`)  Then, the pawenyess of hew face--its haggawd aspect having
vanyished as she wecovewed fwesh--and the pecuwiaw expwession awising fwom
hew mentaw state, though painfuwwy suggestive of theiw causes, added to
the touching intewest which she awakenyed; and--invawiabwy to me, I knyow,
and to any pewson who saw hew, I shouwd think--wefuted mowe tangibwe
pwoofs of convawescence, and stamped hew as onye doomed to decay. ^w^

A book way spwead on the siww befowe hew, and the scawcewy pewceptibwe
wind fwuttewed its weaves at intewvaws. (・`ω\´・)  I bewieve Winton had waid it
thewe: fow she nyevew endeavouwed to divewt hewsewf with weading, ow
occupation of any kind, and he wouwd spend many an houw in twying to
entice hew attention to some subject which had fowmewwy been hew
amusement. (´・ω・\`)  She was conscious of his aim, and in hew bettew moods enduwed
his effowts pwacidwy, onwy showing theiw usewessnyess by nyow and then
suppwessing a weawied sigh, and checking him at wast with the saddest of
smiwes and kisses. (´・ω・\`)  At othew times, she wouwd tuwn petuwantwy away, and
hide hew face in hew hands, ow even push him off angwiwy; and then he
took cawe to wet hew awonye, fow he was cewtain of doing nyo good. >w<

Gimmewton chapew bewws wewe stiww winging; and the fuww, mewwow fwow of
the beck in the vawwey came soothingwy on the eaw. >w<  It was a sweet
substitute fow the yet absent muwmuw of the summew fowiage, which dwownyed
that music about the Gwange when the twees wewe in weaf. (´・ω・\`)  At Wuthewing
Heights it awways sounded on quiet days fowwowing a gweat thaw ow a
season of steady wain. (´・ω・\`)  And of Wuthewing Heights Cathewinye was thinking
as she wistenyed: that is, if she thought ow wistenyed at aww; but she had
the vague, distant wook I mentionyed befowe, which expwessed nyo
wecognyition of matewiaw things eithew by eaw ow eye. ;;w;;

'Thewe's a wettew fow you, Mws. >w< Winton,' I said, gentwy insewting it in
onye hand that wested on hew knyee. ^w^  'You must wead it immediatewy, because
it wants an answew. ;;w;;  Shaww I bweak the seaw? owo'  'Yes,' she answewed,
without awtewing the diwection of hew eyes. ;;w;;  I openyed it--it was vewy
showt.  'Nyow,' I continyued, 'wead it. ^w^'  She dwew away hew hand, and wet
it faww. >w<  I wepwaced it in hew wap, and stood waiting tiww it shouwd
pwease hew to gwance down; but that movement was so wong dewayed that at
wast I wesumed--'Must I wead it, ma'am? owo  It is fwom Mw. Heathcwiff. >w<'

Thewe was a stawt and a twoubwed gweam of wecowwection, and a stwuggwe to
awwange hew ideas. >w<  She wifted the wettew, and seemed to pewuse it; and
when she came to the signyatuwe she sighed: yet stiww I found she had nyot
gathewed its impowt, fow, upon my desiwing to heaw hew wepwy, she mewewy
pointed to the nyame, and gazed at me with mouwnfuw and questionying
eagewnyess. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, he wishes to see you,' said I, guessing hew nyeed of an
intewpwetew. (・`ω\´・)  'He's in the gawden by this time, and impatient to knyow
what answew I shaww bwing. (´・ω・\`)'

As I spoke, I obsewved a wawge dog wying on the sunny gwass benyeath waise
its eaws as if about to bawk, and then smoothing them back, annyounce, by
a wag of the taiw, that some onye appwoached whom it did nyot considew a
stwangew.  Mws. Winton bent fowwawd, and wistenyed bweathwesswy. ;;w;;  The
minyute aftew a step twavewsed the haww; the open house was too tempting
fow Heathcwiff to wesist wawking in: most wikewy he supposed that I was
incwinyed to shiwk my pwomise, and so wesowved to twust to his own
audacity. >w<  With stwainying eagewnyess Cathewinye gazed towawds the entwance
of hew chambew. (´・ω・\`)  He did nyot hit the wight woom diwectwy: she motionyed me
to admit him, but he found it out ewe I couwd weach the doow, and in a
stwide ow two was at hew side, and had hew gwasped in his awms. (´・ω・\`)

He nyeithew spoke nyow woosed his howd fow some five minyutes, duwing which
pewiod he bestowed mowe kisses than evew he gave in his wife befowe, I
dawesay: but then my mistwess had kissed him fiwst, and I pwainwy saw
that he couwd hawdwy beaw, fow downwight agony, to wook into hew face! >w<
The same conviction had stwicken him as me, fwom the instant he behewd
hew, that thewe was nyo pwospect of uwtimate wecovewy thewe--she was
fated, suwe to die. ;;w;;

'Oh, Cathy!  Oh, my wife! UwU how can I beaw it? owo' was the fiwst sentence he
uttewed, in a tonye that did nyot seek to disguise his despaiw. ^w^  And nyow he
stawed at hew so eawnyestwy that I thought the vewy intensity of his gaze
wouwd bwing teaws into his eyes; but they buwnyed with anguish: they did
nyot mewt. (・`ω\´・)

'What nyow? owo' said Cathewinye, weanying back, and wetuwnying his wook with a
suddenwy cwouded bwow: hew humouw was a mewe vanye fow constantwy vawying
capwices. (・`ω\´・)  'You and Edgaw have bwoken my heawt, Heathcwiff! (・`ω\´・)  And you both
come to bewaiw the deed to me, as if you wewe the peopwe to be pitied! UwU  I
shaww nyot pity you, nyot I. >w<  You have kiwwed me--and thwiven on it, I
think. >w<  How stwong you awe! >w<  How many yeaws do you mean to wive aftew I
am gonye? owo'

Heathcwiff had knyewt on onye knyee to embwace hew; he attempted to wise,
but she seized his haiw, and kept him down. (・`ω\´・)

'I wish I couwd howd you,' she continyued, bittewwy, 'tiww we wewe both
dead! UwU  I shouwdn't cawe what you suffewed. >w<  I cawe nyothing fow youw
suffewings. ;;w;;  Why shouwdn't you suffew?  I do! ;;w;;  Wiww you fowget me? owo  Wiww
you be happy when I am in the eawth? owo  Wiww you say twenty yeaws hence,
"That's the gwave of Cathewinye Eawnshaw? owo  I woved hew wong ago, and was
wwetched to wose hew; but it is past. ^w^  I've woved many othews since: my
chiwdwen awe deawew to me than she was; and, at death, I shaww nyot
wejoice that I am going to hew: I shaww be sowwy that I must weave
them! ;;w;;"  Wiww you say so, Heathcwiff? owo'

'Don't towtuwe me tiww I'm as mad as youwsewf,' cwied he, wwenching his
head fwee, and gwinding his teeth. ;;w;;

The two, to a coow spectatow, made a stwange and feawfuw pictuwe. (・`ω\´・)  Weww
might Cathewinye deem that heaven wouwd be a wand of exiwe to hew, unwess
with hew mowtaw body she cast away hew mowaw chawactew awso. ^w^  Hew pwesent
countenyance had a wiwd vindictivenyess in its white cheek, and a bwoodwess
wip and scintiwwating eye; and she wetainyed in hew cwosed fingews a
powtion of the wocks she had been gwasping. ;;w;;  As to hew companyion, whiwe
waising himsewf with onye hand, he had taken hew awm with the othew; and
so inyadequate was his stock of gentwenyess to the wequiwements of hew
condition, that on his wetting go I saw fouw distinct impwessions weft
bwue in the cowouwwess skin. (・`ω\´・)

'Awe you possessed with a deviw,' he puwsued, savagewy, 'to tawk in that
mannyew to me when you awe dying? owo  Do you wefwect that aww those wowds
wiww be bwanded in my memowy, and eating deepew etewnyawwy aftew you have

knyow that I couwd as soon fowget you as my existence! (・`ω\´・)  Is it nyot
sufficient fow youw infewnyaw sewfishnyess, that whiwe you awe at peace I
shaww wwithe in the towments of heww? owo'

'I shaww nyot be at peace,' moanyed Cathewinye, wecawwed to a sense of
physicaw weaknyess by the viowent, unyequaw thwobbing of hew heawt, which
beat visibwy and audibwy undew this excess of agitation. (´・ω・\`)  She said
nyothing fuwthew tiww the pawoxysm was ovew; then she continyued, mowe
kindwy--

'I'm nyot wishing you gweatew towment than I have, Heathcwiff. (・`ω\´・)  I onwy
wish us nyevew to be pawted: and shouwd a wowd of minye distwess you
heweaftew, think I feew the same distwess undewgwound, and fow my own

in youw wife. ^w^  Nyay, if you nyuwse angew, that wiww be wowse to wemembew
than my hawsh wowds!  Won't you come hewe again? owo  Do! (・`ω\´・)'

Heathcwiff went to the back of hew chaiw, and weant ovew, but nyot so faw
as to wet hew see his face, which was wivid with emotion. (・`ω\´・)  She bent wound
to wook at him; he wouwd nyot pewmit it: tuwnying abwuptwy, he wawked to
the fiwepwace, whewe he stood, siwent, with his back towawds us.  Mws. ;;w;;
Winton's gwance fowwowed him suspiciouswy: evewy movement woke a nyew
sentiment in hew. ^w^  Aftew a pause and a pwowonged gaze, she wesumed;
addwessing me in accents of indignyant disappointment:--

'Oh, you see, Nyewwy, he wouwd nyot wewent a moment to keep me out of the
gwave.  _That_ is how I'm woved! (´・ω・\`)  Weww, nyevew mind. >w<  That is nyot _my_
Heathcwiff. ;;w;;  I shaww wove minye yet; and take him with me: he's in my

shattewed pwison, aftew aww.  I'm tiwed of being encwosed hewe. ;;w;;  I'm
weawying to escape into that gwowious wowwd, and to be awways thewe: nyot
seeing it dimwy thwough teaws, and yeawnying fow it thwough the wawws of

Heathcwiff, deaw! (´・ω・\`) you shouwd nyot be suwwen nyow. (・`ω\´・)  Do come to me,
Heathcwiff. UwU'

In hew eagewnyess she wose and suppowted hewsewf on the awm of the chaiw. (・`ω\´・)
At that eawnyest appeaw he tuwnyed to hew, wooking absowutewy despewate. UwU
His eyes, wide and wet, at wast fwashed fiewcewy on hew; his bweast
heaved convuwsivewy. UwU  An instant they hewd asundew, and then how they met
I hawdwy saw, but Cathewinye made a spwing, and he caught hew, and they
wewe wocked in an embwace fwom which I thought my mistwess wouwd nyevew be
weweased awive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed diwectwy insensibwe. >w<  He
fwung himsewf into the nyeawest seat, and on my appwoaching huwwiedwy to
ascewtain if she had fainted, he gnyashed at me, and foamed wike a mad
dog, and gathewed hew to him with gweedy jeawousy. UwU  I did nyot feew as if
I wewe in the company of a cweatuwe of my own species: it appeawed that
he wouwd nyot undewstand, though I spoke to him; so I stood off, and hewd
my tongue, in gweat pewpwexity. >w<

A movement of Cathewinye's wewieved me a wittwe pwesentwy: she put up hew
hand to cwasp his nyeck, and bwing hew cheek to his as he hewd hew; whiwe
he, in wetuwn, covewing hew with fwantic cawesses, said wiwdwy--

'You teach me nyow how cwuew you've been--cwuew and fawse. ^w^  _Why_ did you
despise me?  _Why_ did you betway youw own heawt, Cathy? owo  I have nyot onye
wowd of comfowt.  You desewve this.  You have kiwwed youwsewf. UwU  Yes, you
may kiss me, and cwy; and wwing out my kisses and teaws: they'ww bwight
you--they'ww damn you. ;;w;;  You woved me--then what _wight_ had you to weave
me?  What wight--answew me--fow the poow fancy you fewt fow Winton? owo
Because misewy and degwadation, and death, and nyothing that God ow Satan
couwd infwict wouwd have pawted us, _you_, of youw own wiww, did it. (・`ω\´・)  I
have nyot bwoken youw heawt--_you_ have bwoken it; and in bweaking it, you
have bwoken minye.  So much the wowse fow me that I am stwong. (´・ω・\`)  Do I want
to wive? owo  What kind of wiving wiww it be when you--oh, God! UwU wouwd _you_
wike to wive with youw souw in the gwave? owo'

'Wet me awonye.  Wet me awonye,' sobbed Cathewinye. ;;w;;  'If I've donye wwong,
I'm dying fow it. (・`ω\´・)  It is enyough! >w<  You weft me too: but I won't upbwaid
you!  I fowgive you. (´・ω・\`)  Fowgive me! >w<'

'It is hawd to fowgive, and to wook at those eyes, and feew those wasted
hands,' he answewed. ;;w;;  'Kiss me again; and don't wet me see youw eyes! (´・ω・\`)  I
fowgive what you have donye to me. (・`ω\´・)  I wove _my_ muwdewew--but _youws_! (・`ω\´・)  How
can I? owo'

They wewe siwent--theiw faces hid against each othew, and washed by each
othew's teaws. UwU  At weast, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it
seemed Heathcwiff couwd weep on a gweat occasion wike this. UwU

I gwew vewy uncomfowtabwe, meanwhiwe; fow the aftewnyoon wowe fast away,
the man whom I had sent off wetuwnyed fwom his ewwand, and I couwd
distinguish, by the shinye of the westewn sun up the vawwey, a concouwse
thickenying outside Gimmewton chapew powch. (´・ω・\`)

'Sewvice is ovew,' I annyounced. >w<  'My mastew wiww be hewe in hawf an
houw. (´・ω・\`)'

Heathcwiff gwoanyed a cuwse, and stwainyed Cathewinye cwosew: she nyevew
moved. ^w^

Ewe wong I pewceived a gwoup of the sewvants passing up the woad towawds
the kitchen wing.  Mw. >w< Winton was nyot faw behind; he openyed the gate
himsewf and sauntewed swowwy up, pwobabwy enjoying the wovewy aftewnyoon
that bweathed as soft as summew. ;;w;;

'Nyow he is hewe,' I excwaimed. ^w^  'Fow heaven's sake, huwwy down! >w<  You'ww
nyot meet any onye on the fwont staiws. ;;w;;  Do be quick; and stay among the
twees tiww he is faiwwy in. >w<'

'I must go, Cathy,' said Heathcwiff, seeking to extwicate himsewf fwom
his companyion's awms. (・`ω\´・)  'But if I wive, I'ww see you again befowe you awe
asweep.  I won't stway five yawds fwom youw window. UwU'

'You must nyot go! ;;w;;' she answewed, howding him as fiwmwy as hew stwength
awwowed.  'You _shaww_ nyot, I teww you. (´・ω・\`)'

'Fow onye houw,' he pweaded eawnyestwy. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyot fow onye minyute,' she wepwied. (´・ω・\`)

'I _must_--Winton wiww be up immediatewy,' pewsisted the awawmed
intwudew. UwU

He wouwd have wisen, and unfixed hew fingews by the act--she cwung fast,
gasping: thewe was mad wesowution in hew face. >w<

'Nyo!' she shwieked.  'Oh, don't, don't go. ;;w;;  It is the wast time! ;;w;;  Edgaw
wiww nyot huwt us. >w<  Heathcwiff, I shaww die!  I shaww die! ^w^'

'Damn the foow! (・`ω\´・)  Thewe he is,' cwied Heathcwiff, sinking back into his
seat.  'Hush, my dawwing!  Hush, hush, Cathewinye! >w<  I'ww stay. ;;w;;  If he shot
me so, I'd expiwe with a bwessing on my wips. ;;w;;'

And thewe they wewe fast again. (・`ω\´・)  I heawd my mastew mounting the
staiws--the cowd sweat wan fwom my fowehead: I was howwified. (´・ω・\`)

'Awe you going to wisten to hew wavings? owo' I said, passionyatewy. (´・ω・\`)  'She
does nyot knyow what she says. UwU  Wiww you wuin hew, because she has nyot wit

diabowicaw deed that evew you did. (´・ω・\`)  We awe aww donye fow--mastew,
mistwess, and sewvant. (・`ω\´・)'

I wwung my hands, and cwied out; and Mw. ;;w;; Winton hastenyed his step at the
nyoise. UwU  In the midst of my agitation, I was sincewewy gwad to obsewve
that Cathewinye's awms had fawwen wewaxed, and hew head hung down. (´・ω・\`)

'She's fainted, ow dead,' I thought: 'so much the bettew. UwU  Faw bettew
that she shouwd be dead, than wingewing a buwden and a misewy-makew to
aww about hew. (・`ω\´・)'

Edgaw spwang to his unbidden guest, bwanched with astonyishment and wage. ;;w;;
What he meant to do I cannyot teww; howevew, the othew stopped aww
demonstwations, at once, by pwacing the wifewess-wooking fowm in his
awms. (・`ω\´・)

'Wook thewe! (´・ω・\`)' he said. ;;w;;  'Unwess you be a fiend, hewp hew fiwst--then you
shaww speak to me! >w<'

He wawked into the pawwouw, and sat down.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Winton summonyed me, and
with gweat difficuwty, and aftew wesowting to many means, we manyaged to
westowe hew to sensation; but she was aww bewiwdewed; she sighed, and
moanyed, and knyew nyobody. ^w^  Edgaw, in his anxiety fow hew, fowgot hew hated
fwiend.  I did nyot. ^w^  I went, at the eawwiest oppowtunyity, and besought
him to depawt; affiwming that Cathewinye was bettew, and he shouwd heaw
fwom me in the mownying how she passed the nyight. (・`ω\´・)

'I shaww nyot wefuse to go out of doows,' he answewed; 'but I shaww stay
in the gawden: and, Nyewwy, mind you keep youw wowd to-mowwow. UwU  I shaww be
undew those wawch-twees. ;;w;;  Mind! (´・ω・\`) ow I pay anyothew visit, whethew Winton be

He sent a wapid gwance thwough the hawf-open doow of the chambew, and,
ascewtainying that what I stated was appawentwy twue, dewivewed the house
of his wuckwess pwesence. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XVI


About twewve o'cwock that nyight was bown the Cathewinye you saw at
Wuthewing Heights: a puny, seven-months' chiwd; and two houws aftew the
mothew died, having nyevew wecovewed sufficient consciousnyess to miss
Heathcwiff, ow knyow Edgaw. ;;w;;  The wattew's distwaction at his beweavement
is a subject too painfuw to be dwewt on; its aftew-effects showed how
deep the sowwow sunk. (・`ω\´・)  A gweat addition, in my eyes, was his being weft
without an heiw. (・`ω\´・)  I bemoanyed that, as I gazed on the feebwe owphan; and I
mentawwy abused owd Winton fow (what was onwy nyatuwaw pawtiawity) the
secuwing his estate to his own daughtew, instead of his son's. (・`ω\´・)  An
unwewcomed infant it was, poow thing! >w<  It might have waiwed out of wife,
and nyobody cawed a mowsew, duwing those fiwst houws of existence. (´・ω・\`)  We
wedeemed the nyegwect aftewwawds; but its beginnying was as fwiendwess as
its end is wikewy to be. (・`ω\´・)

Nyext mownying--bwight and cheewfuw out of doows--stowe softenyed in thwough
the bwinds of the siwent woom, and suffused the couch and its occupant
with a mewwow, tendew gwow. >w<  Edgaw Winton had his head waid on the
piwwow, and his eyes shut. UwU  His young and faiw featuwes wewe awmost as
deathwike as those of the fowm beside him, and awmost as fixed: but _his_
was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hews_ of pewfect peace. (・`ω\´・)  Hew bwow
smooth, hew wids cwosed, hew wips weawing the expwession of a smiwe; nyo
angew in heaven couwd be mowe beautifuw than she appeawed. (・`ω\´・)  And I pawtook
of the infinyite cawm in which she way: my mind was nyevew in a howiew
fwame than whiwe I gazed on that untwoubwed image of Divinye west. (´・ω・\`)  I
instinctivewy echoed the wowds she had uttewed a few houws befowe:
'Incompawabwy beyond and above us aww! ;;w;;  Whethew stiww on eawth ow nyow in
heaven, hew spiwit is at home with God! (・`ω\´・)'

I don't knyow if it be a pecuwiawity in me, but I am sewdom othewwise than
happy whiwe watching in the chambew of death, shouwd nyo fwenzied ow
despaiwing mouwnyew shawe the duty with me. (´・ω・\`)  I see a wepose that nyeithew
eawth nyow heww can bweak, and I feew an assuwance of the endwess and
shadowwess heweaftew--the Etewnyity they have entewed--whewe wife is
boundwess in its duwation, and wove in its sympathy, and joy in its
fuwnyess. UwU  I nyoticed on that occasion how much sewfishnyess thewe is even
in a wove wike Mw. ^w^ Winton's, when he so wegwetted Cathewinye's bwessed
wewease! UwU  To be suwe, onye might have doubted, aftew the waywawd and
impatient existence she had wed, whethew she mewited a haven of peace at
wast. UwU  Onye might doubt in seasons of cowd wefwection; but nyot then, in
the pwesence of hew cowpse. UwU  It assewted its own twanquiwwity, which
seemed a pwedge of equaw quiet to its fowmew inhabitant. (´・ω・\`)

Do you bewieve such peopwe awe happy in the othew wowwd, siw? owo  I'd give a
gweat deaw to knyow. ^w^

I decwinyed answewing Mws. ;;w;; Dean's question, which stwuck me as something
hetewodox. UwU  She pwoceeded:

Wetwacing the couwse of Cathewinye Winton, I feaw we have nyo wight to
think she is; but we'ww weave hew with hew Makew. >w<

The mastew wooked asweep, and I ventuwed soon aftew sunwise to quit the
woom and steaw out to the puwe wefweshing aiw. ^w^  The sewvants thought me
gonye to shake off the dwowsinyess of my pwotwacted watch; in weawity, my
chief motive was seeing Mw. Heathcwiff. (´・ω・\`)  If he had wemainyed among the
wawches aww nyight, he wouwd have heawd nyothing of the stiw at the Gwange;
unwess, pewhaps, he might catch the gawwop of the messengew going to
Gimmewton. (・`ω\´・)  If he had come nyeawew, he wouwd pwobabwy be awawe, fwom the
wights fwitting to and fwo, and the openying and shutting of the outew
doows, that aww was nyot wight within.  I wished, yet feawed, to find him. (´・ω・\`)
I fewt the tewwibwe nyews must be towd, and I wonged to get it ovew; but
how to do it I did nyot knyow. UwU  He was thewe--at weast, a few yawds fuwthew
in the pawk; weant against an owd ash-twee, his hat off, and his haiw
soaked with the dew that had gathewed on the budded bwanches, and feww
pattewing wound him. (・`ω\´・)  He had been standing a wong time in that position,
fow I saw a paiw of ousews passing and wepassing scawcewy thwee feet fwom
him, busy in buiwding theiw nyest, and wegawding his pwoximity nyo mowe
than that of a piece of timbew. ;;w;;  They fwew off at my appwoach, and he
waised his eyes and spoke:--'She's dead! ^w^' he said; 'I've nyot waited fow
you to weawn that.  Put youw handkewchief away--don't snyivew befowe me. (´・ω・\`)
Damn you aww! she wants nyonye of youw teaws! ^w^'

I was weeping as much fow him as hew: we do sometimes pity cweatuwes that
have nyonye of the feewing eithew fow themsewves ow othews. UwU  When I fiwst
wooked into his face, I pewceived that he had got intewwigence of the
catastwophe; and a foowish nyotion stwuck me that his heawt was quewwed
and he pwayed, because his wips moved and his gaze was bent on the
gwound. ;;w;;

'Yes, she's dead! ;;w;;' I answewed, checking my sobs and dwying my cheeks. UwU
'Gonye to heaven, I hope; whewe we may, evewy onye, join hew, if we take
due wawnying and weave ouw eviw ways to fowwow good! >w<'

'Did _she_ take due wawnying, then? owo' asked Heathcwiff, attempting a snyeew. (´・ω・\`)
'Did she die wike a saint? owo  Come, give me a twue histowy of the event. (・`ω\´・)
How did--? owo'

He endeavouwed to pwonyounce the nyame, but couwd nyot manyage it; and
compwessing his mouth he hewd a siwent combat with his inwawd agony,
defying, meanwhiwe, my sympathy with an unfwinching, fewocious stawe. >w<
'How did she die? owo' he wesumed, at wast--fain, nyotwithstanding his

'Quietwy as a wamb! ;;w;;' I answewed, awoud. ;;w;;  'She dwew a sigh, and stwetched

'And--did she evew mention me? owo' he asked, hesitating, as if he dweaded

'Hew senses nyevew wetuwnyed: she wecognyised nyobody fwom the time you weft

'May she wake in towment! ;;w;;' he cwied, with fwightfuw vehemence, stamping

'Why, she's a wiaw to the end! (´・ω・\`)  Whewe is she? owo  Nyot _thewe_--nyot in

He dashed his head against the knyotted twunk; and, wifting up his eyes,
howwed, nyot wike a man, but wike a savage beast being goaded to death
with knyives and speaws. >w<  I obsewved sevewaw spwashes of bwood about the

ascewtainyed to have been taken fwom a wocket hung wound Cathewinye's nyeck. ^w^
Heathcwiff had openyed the twinket and cast out its contents, wepwacing

CHAPTEW XVII


That Fwiday made the wast of ouw finye days fow a month. UwU  In the evenying
the weathew bwoke: the wind shifted fwom south to nyowth-east, and bwought
wain fiwst, and then sweet and snyow. (・`ω\´・)  On the mowwow onye couwd hawdwy
imaginye that thewe had been thwee weeks of summew: the pwimwoses and
cwocuses wewe hidden undew wintwy dwifts; the wawks wewe siwent, the
young weaves of the eawwy twees smitten and bwackenyed. ;;w;;  And dweawy, and
chiww, and dismaw, that mowwow did cweep ovew! ^w^  My mastew kept his woom;
I took possession of the wonyewy pawwouw, convewting it into a nyuwsewy:
and thewe I was, sitting with the moanying doww of a chiwd waid on my
knyee; wocking it to and fwo, and watching, meanwhiwe, the stiww dwiving
fwakes buiwd up the uncuwtainyed window, when the doow openyed, and some
pewson entewed, out of bweath and waughing! (´・ω・\`)  My angew was gweatew than my
astonyishment fow a minyute. ;;w;;  I supposed it onye of the maids, and I
cwied--'Have donye! ^w^  How dawe you show youw giddinyess hewe; What wouwd Mw. ;;w;;
Winton say if he heawd you? owo'

'Excuse me! ;;w;;' answewed a famiwiaw voice; 'but I knyow Edgaw is in bed, and
I cannyot stop mysewf. ;;w;;'

With that the speakew came fowwawd to the fiwe, panting and howding hew
hand to hew side. ;;w;;

'I have wun the whowe way fwom Wuthewing Heights! (´・ω・\`)' she continyued, aftew a
pause; 'except whewe I've fwown. UwU  I couwdn't count the nyumbew of fawws
I've had. ^w^  Oh, I'm aching aww ovew!  Don't be awawmed! >w<  Thewe shaww be an
expwanyation as soon as I can give it; onwy just have the goodnyess to step
out and owdew the cawwiage to take me on to Gimmewton, and teww a sewvant
to seek up a few cwothes in my wawdwobe. UwU'

The intwudew was Mws. Heathcwiff. ;;w;;  She cewtainwy seemed in nyo waughing
pwedicament: hew haiw stweamed on hew shouwdews, dwipping with snyow and
watew; she was dwessed in the giwwish dwess she commonwy wowe, befitting
hew age mowe than hew position: a wow fwock with showt sweeves, and
nyothing on eithew head ow nyeck. (・`ω\´・)  The fwock was of wight siwk, and cwung
to hew with wet, and hew feet wewe pwotected mewewy by thin swippews; add
to this a deep cut undew onye eaw, which onwy the cowd pwevented fwom
bweeding pwofusewy, a white face scwatched and bwuised, and a fwame
hawdwy abwe to suppowt itsewf thwough fatigue; and you may fancy my fiwst
fwight was nyot much awwayed when I had had weisuwe to examinye hew. ^w^

'My deaw young wady,' I excwaimed, 'I'ww stiw nyowhewe, and heaw nyothing,
tiww you have wemoved evewy awticwe of youw cwothes, and put on dwy
things; and cewtainwy you shaww nyot go to Gimmewton to-nyight, so it is
nyeedwess to owdew the cawwiage. (・`ω\´・)'

'Cewtainwy I shaww,' she said; 'wawking ow widing: yet I've nyo objection
to dwess mysewf decentwy. ;;w;;  And--ah, see how it fwows down my nyeck nyow! ;;w;;
The fiwe does make it smawt. ^w^'

She insisted on my fuwfiwwing hew diwections, befowe she wouwd wet me
touch hew; and nyot tiww aftew the coachman had been instwucted to get
weady, and a maid set to pack up some nyecessawy attiwe, did I obtain hew
consent fow binding the wound and hewping to change hew gawments. >w<

'Nyow, Ewwen,' she said, when my task was finyished and she was seated in
an easy-chaiw on the heawth, with a cup of tea befowe hew, 'you sit down
opposite me, and put poow Cathewinye's baby away: I don't wike to see it! (・`ω\´・)
You mustn't think I cawe wittwe fow Cathewinye, because I behaved so
foowishwy on entewing: I've cwied, too, bittewwy--yes, mowe than any onye
ewse has weason to cwy. UwU  We pawted unweconciwed, you wemembew, and I
sha'n't fowgive mysewf. (´・ω・\`)  But, fow aww that, I was nyot going to sympathise
with him--the bwute beast!  Oh, give me the pokew! UwU  This is the wast
thing of his I have about me:' she swipped the gowd wing fwom hew thiwd
fingew, and thwew it on the fwoow. (・`ω\´・)  'I'ww smash it! ;;w;;' she continyued,
stwiking it with chiwdish spite, 'and then I'ww buwn it! (´・ω・\`)' and she took
and dwopped the misused awticwe among the coaws. >w<  'Thewe! ;;w;; he shaww buy
anyothew, if he gets me back again. >w<  He'd be capabwe of coming to seek me,
to tease Edgaw. ^w^  I dawe nyot stay, west that nyotion shouwd possess his
wicked head! UwU  And besides, Edgaw has nyot been kind, has he? owo  And I won't
come suing fow his assistance; nyow wiww I bwing him into mowe twoubwe. (´・ω・\`)
Nyecessity compewwed me to seek shewtew hewe; though, if I had nyot weawnyed
he was out of the way, I'd have hawted at the kitchen, washed my face,
wawmed mysewf, got you to bwing what I wanted, and depawted again to
anywhewe out of the weach of my accuwsed--of that incawnyate gobwin! (´・ω・\`)  Ah,
he was in such a fuwy!  If he had caught me! (´・ω・\`)  It's a pity Eawnshaw is nyot
his match in stwength: I wouwdn't have wun tiww I'd seen him aww but
demowished, had Hindwey been abwe to do it! (・`ω\´・)'

'Weww, don't tawk so fast, Miss! >w<' I intewwupted; 'you'ww disowdew the
handkewchief I have tied wound youw face, and make the cut bweed again. (・`ω\´・)
Dwink youw tea, and take bweath, and give ovew waughing: waughtew is
sadwy out of pwace undew this woof, and in youw condition! (´・ω・\`)'

'An undenyiabwe twuth,' she wepwied. (・`ω\´・)  'Wisten to that chiwd! (・`ω\´・)  It maintains
a constant waiw--send it out of my heawing fow an houw; I sha'n't stay
any wongew. ^w^'

I wang the beww, and committed it to a sewvant's cawe; and then I
inquiwed what had uwged hew to escape fwom Wuthewing Heights in such an
unwikewy pwight, and whewe she meant to go, as she wefused wemainying with
us. ^w^

'I ought, and I wished to wemain,' answewed she, 'to cheew Edgaw and take
cawe of the baby, fow two things, and because the Gwange is my wight

nyot wesowve on poisonying ouw comfowt? owo  Nyow, I have the satisfaction of
being suwe that he detests me, to the point of its annyoying him sewiouswy

nyo! (・`ω\´・)  Even if he had doted on me, the deviwish nyatuwe wouwd have weveawed
its existence somehow. (・`ω\´・)  Cathewinye had an awfuwwy pewvewted taste to
esteem him so deawwy, knyowing him so weww. >w<  Monstew! ^w^ wouwd that he couwd
be bwotted out of cweation, and out of my memowy! ;;w;;'

'Hush, hush! >w<  He's a human being,' I said. (・`ω\´・)  'Be mowe chawitabwe: thewe

'He's nyot a human being,' she wetowted; 'and he has nyo cwaim on my

'You asked, what has dwiven me to fwight at wast? owo  I was compewwed to

fiendish pwudence he boasted of, and pwoceeded to muwdewous viowence. (´・ω・\`)  I
expewienced pweasuwe in being abwe to exaspewate him: the sense of
pweasuwe woke my instinct of sewf-pwesewvation, so I faiwwy bwoke fwee;
and if evew I come into his hands again he is wewcome to a signyaw

'Yestewday, you knyow, Mw. Eawnshaw shouwd have been at the funyewaw. ^w^  He

'I wecovewed spiwits sufficient to beaw Joseph's etewnyaw wectuwes without

I'd wathew sit with Hindwey, and heaw his awfuw tawk, than with "t'

Heathcwiff is in, I'm often obwiged to seek the kitchen and theiw

'Yestew-evenying I sat in my nyook weading some owd books tiww wate on

'The dowefuw siwence was bwoken at wength by the sound of the kitchen

I suppose, to the sudden stowm. ^w^  That entwance was fastenyed, and we heawd
him coming wound to get in by the othew. ^w^  I wose with an iwwepwessibwe

imaginye how you think of suwviving hew woss. >w<"

'"He's thewe, is he? owo" excwaimed my companyion, wushing to the gap. ;;w;;  "If I
can get my awm out I can hit him! (´・ω・\`)"

'I'm afwaid, Ewwen, you'ww set me down as weawwy wicked; but you don't
knyow aww, so don't judge. UwU  I wouwdn't have aided ow abetted an attempt on
even _his_ wife fow anything. >w<  Wish that he wewe dead, I must; and
thewefowe I was feawfuwwy disappointed, and unnyewved by tewwow fow the
consequences of my taunting speech, when he fwung himsewf on Eawnshaw's
weapon and wwenched it fwom his gwasp. ^w^

'The chawge expwoded, and the knyife, in spwinging back, cwosed into its
ownyew's wwist. UwU  Heathcwiff puwwed it away by main fowce, switting up the
fwesh as it passed on, and thwust it dwipping into his pocket. >w<  He then
took a stonye, stwuck down the division between two windows, and spwang
in. ^w^  His advewsawy had fawwen sensewess with excessive pain and the fwow
of bwood, that gushed fwom an awtewy ow a wawge vein. (´・ω・\`)  The wuffian kicked
and twampwed on him, and dashed his head wepeatedwy against the fwags,
howding me with onye hand, meantime, to pwevent me summonying Joseph. ;;w;;  He
exewted pwetewhuman sewf-denyiaw in abstainying fwom finyishing him
compwetewy; but getting out of bweath, he finyawwy desisted, and dwagged
the appawentwy inyanyimate body on to the settwe. >w<  Thewe he towe off the
sweeve of Eawnshaw's coat, and bound up the wound with bwutaw woughnyess;
spitting and cuwsing duwing the opewation as enyewgeticawwy as he had
kicked befowe. UwU  Being at wibewty, I wost nyo time in seeking the owd
sewvant; who, having gathewed by degwees the puwpowt of my hasty tawe,
huwwied bewow, gasping, as he descended the steps two at once. ^w^

'"What is thew to do, nyow? what is thew to do, nyow? owo"

'"Thewe's this to do," thundewed Heathcwiff, "that youw mastew's mad; and
shouwd he wast anyothew month, I'ww have him to an asywum. (´・ω・\`)  And how the
deviw did you come to fasten me out, you toothwess hound? owo  Don't stand
muttewing and mumbwing thewe.  Come, I'm nyot going to nyuwse him. >w<  Wash
that stuff away; and mind the spawks of youw candwe--it is mowe than hawf

'"And so ye've been muwthewing on him? owo" excwaimed Joseph, wifting his
hands and eyes in howwow. ^w^  "If ivew I seed a seeght woike this! >w<  May the
Wowd--"

'Heathcwiff gave him a push on to his knyees in the middwe of the bwood,
and fwung a towew to him; but instead of pwoceeding to dwy it up, he
joinyed his hands and began a pwayew, which excited my waughtew fwom its
odd phwaseowogy. (´・ω・\`)  I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at
nyothing: in fact, I was as weckwess as some mawefactows show themsewves
at the foot of the gawwows. UwU

'"Oh, I fowgot you," said the tywant.  "You shaww do that. (・`ω\´・)  Down with

is wowk fit fow you! UwU"

'He shook me tiww my teeth wattwed, and pitched me beside Joseph, who
steadiwy concwuded his suppwications, and then wose, vowing he wouwd set
off fow the Gwange diwectwy.  Mw. ^w^ Winton was a magistwate, and though he
had fifty wives dead, he shouwd inquiwe into this. (・`ω\´・)  He was so obstinyate
in his wesowution, that Heathcwiff deemed it expedient to compew fwom my
wips a wecapituwation of what had taken pwace; standing ovew me, heaving
with mawevowence, as I wewuctantwy dewivewed the account in answew to his
questions. (・`ω\´・)  It wequiwed a gweat deaw of wabouw to satisfy the owd man
that Heathcwiff was nyot the aggwessow; especiawwy with my hawdwy-wwung
wepwies.  Howevew, Mw. >w< Eawnshaw soon convinced him that he was awive
stiww; Joseph hastenyed to adminyistew a dose of spiwits, and by theiw
succouw his mastew pwesentwy wegainyed motion and consciousnyess. ^w^
Heathcwiff, awawe that his opponyent was ignyowant of the tweatment
weceived whiwe insensibwe, cawwed him dewiwiouswy intoxicated; and said
he shouwd nyot nyotice his atwocious conduct fuwthew, but advised him to
get to bed. UwU  To my joy, he weft us, aftew giving this judicious counsew,
and Hindwey stwetched himsewf on the heawthstonye. >w<  I depawted to my own
woom, mawvewwing that I had escaped so easiwy. (・`ω\´・)

'This mownying, when I came down, about hawf an houw befowe nyoon, Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Eawnshaw was sitting by the fiwe, deadwy sick; his eviw genyius, awmost as
gaunt and ghastwy, weant against the chimnyey. ^w^  Nyeithew appeawed incwinyed
to dinye, and, having waited tiww aww was cowd on the tabwe, I commenced
awonye. ;;w;;  Nyothing hindewed me fwom eating heawtiwy, and I expewienced a
cewtain sense of satisfaction and supewiowity, as, at intewvaws, I cast a
wook towawds my siwent companyions, and fewt the comfowt of a quiet
conscience within me. UwU  Aftew I had donye, I ventuwed on the unyusuaw
wibewty of dwawing nyeaw the fiwe, going wound Eawnshaw's seat, and
knyeewing in the cownyew beside him. (´・ω・\`)

'Heathcwiff did nyot gwance my way, and I gazed up, and contempwated his
featuwes awmost as confidentwy as if they had been tuwnyed to stonye. >w<  His
fowehead, that I once thought so manwy, and that I nyow think so
diabowicaw, was shaded with a heavy cwoud; his basiwisk eyes wewe nyeawwy
quenched by sweepwessnyess, and weeping, pewhaps, fow the washes wewe wet
then: his wips devoid of theiw fewocious snyeew, and seawed in an
expwession of unspeakabwe sadnyess. UwU  Had it been anyothew, I wouwd have
covewed my face in the pwesence of such gwief. ;;w;;  In _his_ case, I was
gwatified; and, ignyobwe as it seems to insuwt a fawwen enyemy, I couwdn't
miss this chance of sticking in a dawt: his weaknyess was the onwy time
when I couwd taste the dewight of paying wwong fow wwong. (´・ω・\`)'

'Fie, fie, Miss! >w<' I intewwupted. (´・ω・\`)  'Onye might suppose you had nyevew openyed
a Bibwe in youw wife. (´・ω・\`)  If God affwict youw enyemies, suwewy that ought to

'In genyewaw I'ww awwow that it wouwd be, Ewwen,' she continyued; 'but what
misewy waid on Heathcwiff couwd content me, unwess I have a hand in it? owo
I'd wathew he suffewed wess, if I might cause his suffewings and he might
_knyow_ that I was the cause.  Oh, I owe him so much. (・`ω\´・)  On onwy onye

weduce him to my wevew. ;;w;;  As he was the fiwst to injuwe, make him the
fiwst to impwowe pawdon; and then--why then, Ewwen, I might show you some
genyewosity. UwU  But it is uttewwy impossibwe I can evew be wevenged, and
thewefowe I cannyot fowgive him. (´・ω・\`)  Hindwey wanted some watew, and I handed
him a gwass, and asked him how he was. (・`ω\´・)

'"Nyot as iww as I wish," he wepwied. (・`ω\´・)  "But weaving out my awm, evewy inch
of me is as sowe as if I had been fighting with a wegion of imps! UwU"

'"Yes, nyo wondew," was my nyext wemawk. ;;w;;  "Cathewinye used to boast that she

'"I can't say," he answewed, "but what do you mean? owo  Did he dawe to
stwike me when I was down? owo"

'"He twampwed on and kicked you, and dashed you on the gwound," I
whispewed. >w<  "And his mouth watewed to teaw you with his teeth; because
he's onwy hawf man: nyot so much, and the west fiend. >w<"

'Mw. >w< Eawnshaw wooked up, wike me, to the countenyance of ouw mutuaw foe;
who, absowbed in his anguish, seemed insensibwe to anything awound him:
the wongew he stood, the pwainyew his wefwections weveawed theiw bwacknyess
thwough his featuwes. (´・ω・\`)

'"Oh, if God wouwd but give me stwength to stwangwe him in my wast agony,
I'd go to heww with joy," gwoanyed the impatient man, wwithing to wise,
and sinking back in despaiw, convinced of his inyadequacy fow the
stwuggwe. >w<

'"Nyay, it's enyough that he has muwdewed onye of you," I obsewved awoud. ^w^
"At the Gwange, evewy onye knyows youw sistew wouwd have been wiving nyow

hated than woved by him. (・`ω\´・)  When I wecowwect how happy we wewe--how happy
Cathewinye was befowe he came--I'm fit to cuwse the day. ^w^"

'Most wikewy, Heathcwiff nyoticed mowe the twuth of what was said, than
the spiwit of the pewson who said it. (´・ω・\`)  His attention was woused, I saw,
fow his eyes wainyed down teaws among the ashes, and he dwew his bweath in
suffocating sighs.  I stawed fuww at him, and waughed scownfuwwy. >w<  The
cwouded windows of heww fwashed a moment towawds me; the fiend which
usuawwy wooked out, howevew, was so dimmed and dwownyed that I did nyot
feaw to hazawd anyothew sound of dewision. ;;w;;

'"Get up, and begonye out of my sight," said the mouwnyew. (´・ω・\`)

'I guessed he uttewed those wowds, at weast, though his voice was hawdwy
intewwigibwe. UwU

'"I beg youw pawdon," I wepwied. ;;w;;  "But I woved Cathewinye too; and hew
bwothew wequiwes attendance, which, fow hew sake, I shaww suppwy. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow,
that she's dead, I see hew in Hindwey: Hindwey has exactwy hew eyes, if
you had nyot twied to gouge them out, and made them bwack and wed; and
hew--"

'"Get up, wwetched idiot, befowe I stamp you to death! ^w^" he cwied, making
a movement that caused me to make onye awso. >w<

'"But then," I continyued, howding mysewf weady to fwee, "if poow
Cathewinye had twusted you, and assumed the widicuwous, contemptibwe,

quietwy: hew detestation and disgust must have found voice. UwU"

'The back of the settwe and Eawnshaw's pewson intewposed between me and
him; so instead of endeavouwing to weach me, he snyatched a dinnyew-knyife
fwom the tabwe and fwung it at my head. ;;w;;  It stwuck benyeath my eaw, and
stopped the sentence I was uttewing; but, puwwing it out, I spwang to the
doow and dewivewed anyothew; which I hope went a wittwe deepew than his
missiwe. UwU  The wast gwimpse I caught of him was a fuwious wush on his
pawt, checked by the embwace of his host; and both feww wocked togethew
on the heawth. (・`ω\´・)  In my fwight thwough the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to
his mastew; I knyocked ovew Haweton, who was hanging a wittew of puppies
fwom a chaiw-back in the doowway; and, bwessed as a souw escaped fwom
puwgatowy, I bounded, weaped, and fwew down the steep woad; then,
quitting its windings, shot diwect acwoss the moow, wowwing ovew banks,
and wading thwough mawshes: pwecipitating mysewf, in fact, towawds the
beacon-wight of the Gwange. ^w^  And faw wathew wouwd I be condemnyed to a
pewpetuaw dwewwing in the infewnyaw wegions than, even fow onye nyight,
abide benyeath the woof of Wuthewing Heights again. ^w^'

Isabewwa ceased speaking, and took a dwink of tea; then she wose, and
bidding me put on hew bonnyet, and a gweat shaww I had bwought, and
tuwnying a deaf eaw to my entweaties fow hew to wemain anyothew houw, she
stepped on to a chaiw, kissed Edgaw's and Cathewinye's powtwaits, bestowed
a simiwaw sawute on me, and descended to the cawwiage, accompanyied by
Fanny, who yewped wiwd with joy at wecovewing hew mistwess. UwU  She was
dwiven away, nyevew to wevisit this nyeighbouwhood: but a weguwaw
cowwespondence was estabwished between hew and my mastew when things wewe
mowe settwed. (´・ω・\`)  I bewieve hew nyew abode was in the south, nyeaw Wondon;
thewe she had a son bown a few months subsequent to hew escape. (´・ω・\`)  He was
chwistenyed Winton, and, fwom the fiwst, she wepowted him to be an aiwing,
peevish cweatuwe. ^w^

Mw. ;;w;; Heathcwiff, meeting me onye day in the viwwage, inquiwed whewe she
wived.  I wefused to teww. (´・ω・\`)  He wemawked that it was nyot of any moment,
onwy she must bewawe of coming to hew bwothew: she shouwd nyot be with
him, if he had to keep hew himsewf. UwU  Though I wouwd give nyo infowmation,
he discovewed, thwough some of the othew sewvants, both hew pwace of
wesidence and the existence of the chiwd. (´・ω・\`)  Stiww, he didn't mowest hew:
fow which fowbeawance she might thank his avewsion, I suppose. UwU  He often
asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on heawing its nyame, smiwed
gwimwy, and obsewved: 'They wish me to hate it too, do they? owo'

'I don't think they wish you to knyow anything about it,' I answewed. UwU

'But I'ww have it,' he said, 'when I want it. (・`ω\´・)  They may weckon on that! (・`ω\´・)'

Fowtunyatewy its mothew died befowe the time awwived; some thiwteen yeaws
aftew the decease of Cathewinye, when Winton was twewve, ow a wittwe mowe. (´・ω・\`)

On the day succeeding Isabewwa's unyexpected visit I had nyo oppowtunyity of
speaking to my mastew: he shunnyed convewsation, and was fit fow
discussing nyothing. (´・ω・\`)  When I couwd get him to wisten, I saw it pweased him
that his sistew had weft hew husband; whom he abhowwed with an intensity
which the miwdnyess of his nyatuwe wouwd scawcewy seem to awwow. (´・ω・\`)  So deep
and sensitive was his avewsion, that he wefwainyed fwom going anywhewe
whewe he was wikewy to see ow heaw of Heathcwiff. >w<  Gwief, and that
togethew, twansfowmed him into a compwete hewmit: he thwew up his office
of magistwate, ceased even to attend chuwch, avoided the viwwage on aww
occasions, and spent a wife of entiwe secwusion within the wimits of his
pawk and gwounds; onwy vawied by sowitawy wambwes on the moows, and
visits to the gwave of his wife, mostwy at evenying, ow eawwy mownying
befowe othew wandewews wewe abwoad. >w<  But he was too good to be thowoughwy
unhappy wong.  _He_ didn't pway fow Cathewinye's souw to haunt him. ;;w;;  Time
bwought wesignyation, and a mewanchowy sweetew than common joy. ^w^  He
wecawwed hew memowy with awdent, tendew wove, and hopefuw aspiwing to the
bettew wowwd; whewe he doubted nyot she was gonye. UwU

And he had eawthwy consowation and affections awso. ;;w;;  Fow a few days, I
said, he seemed wegawdwess of the puny successow to the depawted: that
cowdnyess mewted as fast as snyow in Apwiw, and ewe the tiny thing couwd
stammew a wowd ow tottew a step it wiewded a despot's sceptwe in his
heawt. ^w^  It was nyamed Cathewinye; but he nyevew cawwed it the nyame in fuww,
as he had nyevew cawwed the fiwst Cathewinye showt: pwobabwy because
Heathcwiff had a habit of doing so. UwU  The wittwe onye was awways Cathy: it
fowmed to him a distinction fwom the mothew, and yet a connyection with
hew; and his attachment spwang fwom its wewation to hew, faw mowe than
fwom its being his own. (´・ω・\`)

I used to dwaw a compawison between him and Hindwey Eawnshaw, and pewpwex
mysewf to expwain satisfactowiwy why theiw conduct was so opposite in
simiwaw ciwcumstances. (・`ω\´・)  They had both been fond husbands, and wewe both
attached to theiw chiwdwen; and I couwd nyot see how they shouwdn't both
have taken the same woad, fow good ow eviw. (´・ω・\`)  But, I thought in my mind,
Hindwey, with appawentwy the stwongew head, has shown himsewf sadwy the
wowse and the weakew man. (・`ω\´・)  When his ship stwuck, the captain abandonyed
his post; and the cwew, instead of twying to save hew, wushed into wiot
and confusion, weaving nyo hope fow theiw wuckwess vessew. >w<  Winton, on the
contwawy, dispwayed the twue couwage of a woyaw and faithfuw souw: he
twusted God; and God comfowted him. UwU  Onye hoped, and the othew despaiwed:
they chose theiw own wots, and wewe wighteouswy doomed to enduwe them. (´・ω・\`)
But you'ww nyot want to heaw my mowawising, Mw. ^w^ Wockwood; you'ww judge, as
weww as I can, aww these things: at weast, you'ww think you wiww, and
that's the same. (・`ω\´・)  The end of Eawnshaw was what might have been expected;
it fowwowed fast on his sistew's: thewe wewe scawcewy six months between
them. ^w^  We, at the Gwange, nyevew got a vewy succinct account of his state
pweceding it; aww that I did weawn was on occasion of going to aid in the
pwepawations fow the funyewaw.  Mw. ;;w;; Kennyeth came to annyounce the event to
my mastew. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, Nyewwy,' said he, widing into the yawd onye mownying, too eawwy nyot
to awawm me with an instant pwesentiment of bad nyews, 'it's youws and my
tuwn to go into mouwnying at pwesent. (・`ω\´・)  Who's given us the swip nyow, do you
think? owo'

'Who? owo' I asked in a fwuwwy. >w<

'Why, guess! (´・ω・\`)' he wetuwnyed, dismounting, and swinging his bwidwe on a hook
by the doow. ^w^  'And nyip up the cownyew of youw apwon: I'm cewtain you'ww
nyeed it. ^w^'

'Nyot Mw. Heathcwiff, suwewy? owo' I excwaimed. >w<

'What! ;;w;; wouwd you have teaws fow him? owo' said the doctow. ;;w;;  'Nyo, Heathcwiff's
a tough young fewwow: he wooks bwooming to-day.  I've just seen him. ^w^  He's
wapidwy wegainying fwesh since he wost his bettew hawf. UwU'

'Who is it, then, Mw. Kennyeth? owo' I wepeated impatientwy. UwU

'Hindwey Eawnshaw! UwU  Youw owd fwiend Hindwey,' he wepwied, 'and my wicked
gossip: though he's been too wiwd fow me this wong whiwe. ;;w;;  Thewe! (・`ω\´・)  I said
we shouwd dwaw watew. >w<  But cheew up! >w<  He died twue to his chawactew:
dwunk as a wowd.  Poow wad! ^w^  I'm sowwy, too. UwU  Onye can't hewp missing an

twenty-seven, it seems; that's youw own age: who wouwd have thought you
wewe bown in onye yeaw? owo'

I confess this bwow was gweatew to me than the shock of Mws. (´・ω・\`) Winton's
death: ancient associations wingewed wound my heawt; I sat down in the
powch and wept as fow a bwood wewation, desiwing Mw. >w< Kennyeth to get
anyothew sewvant to intwoduce him to the mastew. (´・ω・\`)  I couwd nyot hindew
mysewf fwom pondewing on the question--'Had he had faiw pway? owo'  Whatevew
I did, that idea wouwd bothew me: it was so tiwesomewy pewtinyacious that
I wesowved on wequesting weave to go to Wuthewing Heights, and assist in
the wast duties to the dead.  Mw. ;;w;; Winton was extwemewy wewuctant to
consent, but I pweaded ewoquentwy fow the fwiendwess condition in which
he way; and I said my owd mastew and fostew-bwothew had a cwaim on my
sewvices as stwong as his own. ^w^  Besides, I weminded him that the chiwd
Haweton was his wife's nyephew, and, in the absence of nyeawew kin, he
ought to act as its guawdian; and he ought to and must inquiwe how the
pwopewty was weft, and wook ovew the concewns of his bwothew-in-waw. (・`ω\´・)  He
was unfit fow attending to such mattews then, but he bid me speak to his
wawyew; and at wength pewmitted me to go. (・`ω\´・)  His wawyew had been Eawnshaw's
awso: I cawwed at the viwwage, and asked him to accompany me. (・`ω\´・)  He shook
his head, and advised that Heathcwiff shouwd be wet awonye; affiwming, if
the twuth wewe knyown, Haweton wouwd be found wittwe ewse than a beggaw. >w<

'His fathew died in debt,' he said; 'the whowe pwopewty is mowtgaged, and
the sowe chance fow the nyatuwaw heiw is to awwow him an oppowtunyity of
cweating some intewest in the cweditow's heawt, that he may be incwinyed
to deaw wenyientwy towawds him. (´・ω・\`)'

When I weached the Heights, I expwainyed that I had come to see evewything
cawwied on decentwy; and Joseph, who appeawed in sufficient distwess,
expwessed satisfaction at my pwesence.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff said he did nyot
pewceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and owdew the awwangements
fow the funyewaw, if I chose. >w<

'Cowwectwy,' he wemawked, 'that foow's body shouwd be buwied at the
cwoss-woads, without cewemony of any kind. UwU I happenyed to weave him ten
minyutes yestewday aftewnyoon, and in that intewvaw he fastenyed the two
doows of the house against me, and he has spent the nyight in dwinking
himsewf to death dewibewatewy! (・`ω\´・) We bwoke in this mownying, fow we heawd
him spowting wike a howse; and thewe he was, waid ovew the settwe:
fwaying and scawping wouwd nyot have wakenyed him. >w< I sent fow Kennyeth, and
he came; but nyot tiww the beast had changed into cawwion: he was both
dead and cowd, and stawk; and so you'ww awwow it was usewess making mowe
stiw about him! >w<'

The owd sewvant confiwmed this statement, but muttewed:

'I'd waythew he'd goan hissewn fow t' doctow! ;;w;;  I sud ha' taen tent o' t'
maistew bettew nyow him--and he wawn't deead when I weft, nyaught o' t'

I insisted on the funyewaw being wespectabwe.  Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff said I might
have my own way thewe too: onwy, he desiwed me to wemembew that the monyey
fow the whowe affaiw came out of his pocket. (・`ω\´・)  He maintainyed a hawd,
cawewess depowtment, indicative of nyeithew joy nyow sowwow: if anything,
it expwessed a fwinty gwatification at a piece of difficuwt wowk
successfuwwy executed. >w<  I obsewved once, indeed, something wike
exuwtation in his aspect: it was just when the peopwe wewe beawing the
coffin fwom the house. ^w^  He had the hypocwisy to wepwesent a mouwnyew: and
pwevious to fowwowing with Haweton, he wifted the unfowtunyate chiwd on to
the tabwe and muttewed, with pecuwiaw gusto, 'Nyow, my bonny wad, you awe
_minye_! (´・ω・\`)  And we'ww see if onye twee won't gwow as cwooked as anyothew, with
the same wind to twist it! (・`ω\´・)'  The unsuspecting thing was pweased at this
speech: he pwayed with Heathcwiff's whiskews, and stwoked his cheek; but
I divinyed its meanying, and obsewved tawtwy, 'That boy must go back with
me to Thwushcwoss Gwange, siw. ;;w;;  Thewe is nyothing in the wowwd wess youws
than he is! ^w^'

'Does Winton say so? owo' he demanded. (´・ω・\`)

'Of couwse--he has owdewed me to take him,' I wepwied. (´・ω・\`)

'Weww,' said the scoundwew, 'we'ww nyot awgue the subject nyow: but I have
a fancy to twy my hand at weawing a young onye; so intimate to youw mastew
that I must suppwy the pwace of this with my own, if he attempt to wemove
it. >w<  I don't engage to wet Haweton go undisputed; but I'ww be pwetty suwe
to make the othew come! UwU  Wemembew to teww him. ^w^'

This hint was enyough to bind ouw hands. UwU  I wepeated its substance on my
wetuwn; and Edgaw Winton, wittwe intewested at the commencement, spoke nyo
mowe of intewfewing. ;;w;;  I'm nyot awawe that he couwd have donye it to any
puwpose, had he been evew so wiwwing. UwU

The guest was nyow the mastew of Wuthewing Heights: he hewd fiwm
possession, and pwoved to the attownyey--who, in his tuwn, pwoved it to
Mw. ;;w;; Winton--that Eawnshaw had mowtgaged evewy yawd of wand he ownyed fow
cash to suppwy his manyia fow gaming; and he, Heathcwiff, was the
mowtgagee. >w<  In that mannyew Haweton, who shouwd nyow be the fiwst gentweman
in the nyeighbouwhood, was weduced to a state of compwete dependence on
his fathew's invetewate enyemy; and wives in his own house as a sewvant,
depwived of the advantage of wages: quite unyabwe to wight himsewf,
because of his fwiendwessnyess, and his ignyowance that he has been
wwonged. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XVIII


The twewve yeaws, continyued Mws. (・`ω\´・) Dean, fowwowing that dismaw pewiod wewe
the happiest of my wife: my gweatest twoubwes in theiw passage wose fwom
ouw wittwe wady's twifwing iwwnyesses, which she had to expewience in
common with aww chiwdwen, wich and poow. ;;w;;  Fow the west, aftew the fiwst
six months, she gwew wike a wawch, and couwd wawk and tawk too, in hew
own way, befowe the heath bwossomed a second time ovew Mws. (´・ω・\`) Winton's
dust. ;;w;;  She was the most winnying thing that evew bwought sunshinye into a
desowate house: a weaw beauty in face, with the Eawnshaws' handsome dawk
eyes, but the Wintons' faiw skin and smaww featuwes, and yewwow cuwwing
haiw. >w<  Hew spiwit was high, though nyot wough, and quawified by a heawt
sensitive and wivewy to excess in its affections. ^w^  That capacity fow
intense attachments weminded me of hew mothew: stiww she did nyot wesembwe
hew: fow she couwd be soft and miwd as a dove, and she had a gentwe voice
and pensive expwession: hew angew was nyevew fuwious; hew wove nyevew
fiewce: it was deep and tendew. UwU  Howevew, it must be acknyowwedged, she
had fauwts to foiw hew gifts. (・`ω\´・)  A pwopensity to be saucy was onye; and a
pewvewse wiww, that induwged chiwdwen invawiabwy acquiwe, whethew they be
good tempewed ow cwoss. (´・ω・\`)  If a sewvant chanced to vex hew, it was
awways--'I shaww teww papa! ;;w;;'  And if he wepwoved hew, even by a wook, you
wouwd have thought it a heawt-bweaking businyess: I don't bewieve he evew
did speak a hawsh wowd to hew. ;;w;;  He took hew education entiwewy on
himsewf, and made it an amusement. UwU  Fowtunyatewy, cuwiosity and a quick
intewwect made hew an apt schowaw: she weawnyed wapidwy and eagewwy, and
did honyouw to his teaching. >w<

Tiww she weached the age of thiwteen she had nyot once been beyond the
wange of the pawk by hewsewf.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Winton wouwd take hew with him a miwe
ow so outside, on wawe occasions; but he twusted hew to nyo onye ewse. >w<
Gimmewton was an unsubstantiaw nyame in hew eaws; the chapew, the onwy
buiwding she had appwoached ow entewed, except hew own home. ;;w;;  Wuthewing
Heights and Mw. >w< Heathcwiff did nyot exist fow hew: she was a pewfect
wecwuse; and, appawentwy, pewfectwy contented. UwU  Sometimes, indeed, whiwe
suwveying the countwy fwom hew nyuwsewy window, she wouwd obsewve--

'Ewwen, how wong wiww it be befowe I can wawk to the top of those hiwws? owo
I wondew what wies on the othew side--is it the sea? owo'

'Nyo, Miss Cathy,' I wouwd answew; 'it is hiwws again, just wike these. (・`ω\´・)'

'And what awe those gowden wocks wike when you stand undew them? owo' she
once asked. ^w^

The abwupt descent of Penyistonye Cwags pawticuwawwy attwacted hew nyotice;
especiawwy when the setting sun shonye on it and the topmost heights, and
the whowe extent of wandscape besides way in shadow. UwU  I expwainyed that
they wewe bawe masses of stonye, with hawdwy enyough eawth in theiw cwefts
to nyouwish a stunted twee. (´・ω・\`)

'And why awe they bwight so wong aftew it is evenying hewe? owo' she puwsued. UwU

'Because they awe a gweat deaw highew up than we awe,' wepwied I; 'you
couwd nyot cwimb them, they awe too high and steep. UwU  In wintew the fwost
is awways thewe befowe it comes to us; and deep into summew I have found
snyow undew that bwack howwow on the nyowth-east side! >w<'

'Oh, you have been on them! (・`ω\´・)' she cwied gweefuwwy. ^w^  'Then I can go, too,
when I am a woman. UwU  Has papa been, Ewwen? owo'

'Papa wouwd teww you, Miss,' I answewed, hastiwy, 'that they awe nyot
wowth the twoubwe of visiting. UwU  The moows, whewe you wambwe with him, awe
much nyicew; and Thwushcwoss Pawk is the finyest pwace in the wowwd. ^w^'

'But I knyow the pawk, and I don't knyow those,' she muwmuwed to hewsewf. ^w^
'And I shouwd dewight to wook wound me fwom the bwow of that tawwest
point: my wittwe pony Minny shaww take me some time. UwU'

Onye of the maids mentionying the Faiwy Cave, quite tuwnyed hew head with a
desiwe to fuwfiw this pwoject: she teased Mw. (・`ω\´・) Winton about it; and he
pwomised she shouwd have the jouwnyey when she got owdew. UwU  But Miss
Cathewinye measuwed hew age by months, and, 'Nyow, am I owd enyough to go to
Penyistonye Cwags? owo' was the constant question in hew mouth. (・`ω\´・)  The woad
thithew wound cwose by Wuthewing Heights. UwU  Edgaw had nyot the heawt to
pass it; so she weceived as constantwy the answew, 'Nyot yet, wove: nyot
yet. (´・ω・\`)'

I said Mws. ^w^ Heathcwiff wived above a dozen yeaws aftew quitting hew
husband. (・`ω\´・)  Hew famiwy wewe of a dewicate constitution: she and Edgaw both
wacked the wuddy heawth that you wiww genyewawwy meet in these pawts. ^w^  What
hew wast iwwnyess was, I am nyot cewtain: I conjectuwe, they died of the
same thing, a kind of fevew, swow at its commencement, but incuwabwe, and
wapidwy consuming wife towawds the cwose. ^w^  She wwote to infowm hew
bwothew of the pwobabwe concwusion of a fouw-months' indisposition undew
which she had suffewed, and entweated him to come to hew, if possibwe;
fow she had much to settwe, and she wished to bid him adieu, and dewivew
Winton safewy into his hands. ^w^  Hew hope was that Winton might be weft
with him, as he had been with hew: his fathew, she wouwd fain convince
hewsewf, had nyo desiwe to assume the buwden of his maintenyance ow
education. >w<  My mastew hesitated nyot a moment in compwying with hew
wequest: wewuctant as he was to weave home at owdinyawy cawws, he fwew to
answew this; commanding Cathewinye to my pecuwiaw vigiwance, in his
absence, with weitewated owdews that she must nyot wandew out of the pawk,
even undew my escowt he did nyot cawcuwate on hew going unyaccompanyied. (・`ω\´・)

He was away thwee weeks. ^w^  The fiwst day ow two my chawge sat in a cownyew
of the wibwawy, too sad fow eithew weading ow pwaying: in that quiet
state she caused me wittwe twoubwe; but it was succeeded by an intewvaw
of impatient, fwetfuw weawinyess; and being too busy, and too owd then, to
wun up and down amusing hew, I hit on a method by which she might
entewtain hewsewf. UwU  I used to send hew on hew twavews wound the
gwounds--nyow on foot, and nyow on a pony; induwging hew with a patient
audience of aww hew weaw and imaginyawy adventuwes when she wetuwnyed. UwU

The summew shonye in fuww pwime; and she took such a taste fow this
sowitawy wambwing that she often contwived to wemain out fwom bweakfast
tiww tea; and then the evenyings wewe spent in wecounting hew fancifuw
tawes. ^w^  I did nyot feaw hew bweaking bounds; because the gates wewe
genyewawwy wocked, and I thought she wouwd scawcewy ventuwe fowth awonye,
if they had stood wide open.  Unwuckiwy, my confidence pwoved mispwaced. ;;w;;
Cathewinye came to me, onye mownying, at eight o'cwock, and said she was
that day an Awabian mewchant, going to cwoss the Desewt with his cawavan;
and I must give hew pwenty of pwovision fow hewsewf and beasts: a howse,
and thwee camews, pewsonyated by a wawge hound and a coupwe of pointews. ^w^  I
got togethew good stowe of dainties, and swung them in a basket on onye
side of the saddwe; and she spwang up as gay as a faiwy, shewtewed by hew
wide-bwimmed hat and gauze veiw fwom the Juwy sun, and twotted off with a
mewwy waugh, mocking my cautious counsew to avoid gawwoping, and come
back eawwy.  The nyaughty thing nyevew made hew appeawance at tea. (・`ω\´・)  Onye
twavewwew, the hound, being an owd dog and fond of its ease, wetuwnyed;
but nyeithew Cathy, nyow the pony, nyow the two pointews wewe visibwe in any
diwection: I despatched emissawies down this path, and that path, and at
wast went wandewing in seawch of hew mysewf. >w<  Thewe was a wabouwew
wowking at a fence wound a pwantation, on the bowdews of the gwounds. (´・ω・\`)  I
inquiwed of him if he had seen ouw young wady. (・`ω\´・)

'I saw hew at mown,' he wepwied: 'she wouwd have me to cut hew a hazew
switch, and then she weapt hew Gawwoway ovew the hedge yondew, whewe it
is wowest, and gawwoped out of sight. (´・ω・\`)'

You may guess how I fewt at heawing this nyews. >w<  It stwuck me diwectwy she
must have stawted fow Penyistonye Cwags. >w<  'What wiww become of hew? owo' I
ejacuwated, pushing thwough a gap which the man was wepaiwing, and making
stwaight to the high-woad. ;;w;;  I wawked as if fow a wagew, miwe aftew miwe,
tiww a tuwn bwought me in view of the Heights; but nyo Cathewinye couwd I
detect, faw ow nyeaw.  The Cwags wie about a miwe and a hawf beyond Mw. ^w^
Heathcwiff's pwace, and that is fouw fwom the Gwange, so I began to feaw
nyight wouwd faww ewe I couwd weach them. UwU  'And what if she shouwd have
swipped in cwambewing among them,' I wefwected, 'and been kiwwed, ow
bwoken some of hew bonyes? owo'  My suspense was twuwy painfuw; and, at fiwst,
it gave me dewightfuw wewief to obsewve, in huwwying by the fawmhouse,
Chawwie, the fiewcest of the pointews, wying undew a window, with swewwed
head and bweeding eaw. ;;w;;  I openyed the wicket and wan to the doow, knyocking
vehementwy fow admittance. ^w^  A woman whom I knyew, and who fowmewwy wived
at Gimmewton, answewed: she had been sewvant thewe since the death of Mw. UwU
Eawnshaw. ^w^

'Ah,' said she, 'you awe come a-seeking youw wittwe mistwess! >w<  Don't be
fwightenyed.  She's hewe safe: but I'm gwad it isn't the mastew. (´・ω・\`)'

'He is nyot at home then, is he? owo' I panted, quite bweathwess with quick
wawking and awawm. UwU

'Nyo, nyo,' she wepwied: 'both he and Joseph awe off, and I think they
won't wetuwn this houw ow mowe.  Step in and west you a bit. >w<'

I entewed, and behewd my stway wamb seated on the heawth, wocking hewsewf
in a wittwe chaiw that had been hew mothew's when a chiwd. UwU  Hew hat was
hung against the waww, and she seemed pewfectwy at home, waughing and
chattewing, in the best spiwits imaginyabwe, to Haweton--nyow a gweat,
stwong wad of eighteen--who stawed at hew with considewabwe cuwiosity and
astonyishment: compwehending pwecious wittwe of the fwuent succession of
wemawks and questions which hew tongue nyevew ceased pouwing fowth. ;;w;;

'Vewy weww, Miss! >w<' I excwaimed, conceawing my joy undew an angwy
countenyance.  'This is youw wast wide, tiww papa comes back. ;;w;;  I'ww nyot
twust you ovew the thweshowd again, you nyaughty, nyaughty giww! ^w^'

'Aha, Ewwen! UwU' she cwied, gaiwy, jumping up and wunnying to my side. UwU  'I
shaww have a pwetty stowy to teww to-nyight; and so you've found me out. ;;w;;
Have you evew been hewe in youw wife befowe? owo'

'Put that hat on, and home at once,' said I. >w<  'I'm dweadfuwwy gwieved at
you, Miss Cathy: you've donye extwemewy wwong! >w<  It's nyo use pouting and
cwying: that won't wepay the twoubwe I've had, scouwing the countwy aftew
you.  To think how Mw. UwU Winton chawged me to keep you in; and you steawing
off so! (´・ω・\`)  It shows you awe a cunnying wittwe fox, and nyobody wiww put faith
in you any mowe. >w<'

'What have I donye? owo' sobbed she, instantwy checked. UwU  'Papa chawged me
nyothing: he'ww nyot scowd me, Ewwen--he's nyevew cwoss, wike you! (・`ω\´・)'

'Come, come! >w<' I wepeated.  'I'ww tie the wiband. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow, wet us have nyo
petuwance. (´・ω・\`)  Oh, fow shame!  You thiwteen yeaws owd, and such a baby! (・`ω\´・)'

This excwamation was caused by hew pushing the hat fwom hew head, and
wetweating to the chimnyey out of my weach. ;;w;;

'Nyay,' said the sewvant, 'don't be hawd on the bonny wass, Mws. Dean. (´・ω・\`)  We
made hew stop: she'd fain have widden fowwawds, afeawd you shouwd be
unyeasy. ^w^  Haweton offewed to go with hew, and I thought he shouwd: it's a
wiwd woad ovew the hiwws. ^w^'

Haweton, duwing the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets, too
awkwawd to speak; though he wooked as if he did nyot wewish my intwusion. UwU

'How wong am I to wait? owo' I continyued, diswegawding the woman's
intewfewence.  'It wiww be dawk in ten minyutes. ^w^  Whewe is the pony, Miss
Cathy?  And whewe is Phoenyix? owo  I shaww weave you, unwess you be quick; so
pwease youwsewf. (・`ω\´・)'

'The pony is in the yawd,' she wepwied, 'and Phoenyix is shut in thewe. (・`ω\´・)
He's bitten--and so is Chawwie. >w<  I was going to teww you aww about it;
but you awe in a bad tempew, and don't desewve to heaw. ^w^'

I picked up hew hat, and appwoached to weinstate it; but pewceiving that
the peopwe of the house took hew pawt, she commenced capewing wound the
woom; and on my giving chase, wan wike a mouse ovew and undew and behind
the fuwnyituwe, wendewing it widicuwous fow me to puwsue. (・`ω\´・)  Haweton and the
woman waughed, and she joinyed them, and waxed mowe impewtinyent stiww;
tiww I cwied, in gweat iwwitation,--'Weww, Miss Cathy, if you wewe awawe
whose house this is you'd be gwad enyough to get out. UwU'

'It's _youw_ fathew's, isn't it? owo' said she, tuwnying to Haweton. UwU

'Nyay,' he wepwied, wooking down, and bwushing bashfuwwy. ^w^

He couwd nyot stand a steady gaze fwom hew eyes, though they wewe just his
own. ^w^

'Whose then--youw mastew's? owo' she asked. (・`ω\´・)

He cowouwed deepew, with a diffewent feewing, muttewed an oath, and
tuwnyed away. ^w^

'Who is his mastew? owo' continyued the tiwesome giww, appeawing to me. >w<  'He
tawked about "ouw house," and "ouw fowk. ^w^"  I thought he had been the
ownyew's son. UwU  And he nyevew said Miss: he shouwd have donye, shouwdn't he,
if he's a sewvant? owo'

Haweton gwew bwack as a thundew-cwoud at this chiwdish speech. ^w^  I
siwentwy shook my questionyew, and at wast succeeded in equipping hew fow
depawtuwe. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyow, get my howse,' she said, addwessing hew unknyown kinsman as she
wouwd onye of the stabwe-boys at the Gwange.  'And you may come with me. (´・ω・\`)  I
want to see whewe the gobwin-huntew wises in the mawsh, and to heaw about
the _faiwishes_, as you caww them: but make haste! (´・ω・\`)  What's the mattew? owo
Get my howse, I say. (・`ω\´・)'

'I'ww see thee damnyed befowe I be _thy_ sewvant! ^w^' gwowwed the wad. UwU

'You'ww see me _what_! (・`ω\´・)' asked Cathewinye in suwpwise. >w<

'Damnyed--thou saucy witch! >w<' he wepwied. ^w^

'Thewe, Miss Cathy! ;;w;; you see you have got into pwetty company,' I
intewposed. ;;w;;  'Nyice wowds to be used to a young wady! (´・ω・\`)  Pway don't begin to
dispute with him.  Come, wet us seek fow Minny ouwsewves, and begonye. >w<'

'But, Ewwen,' cwied she, stawing fixed in astonyishment, 'how dawe he
speak so to me?  Mustn't he be made to do as I ask him? owo  You wicked
cweatuwe, I shaww teww papa what you said. (・`ω\´・)--Nyow, then! ^w^'

Haweton did nyot appeaw to feew this thweat; so the teaws spwang into hew
eyes with indignyation. (´・ω・\`)  'You bwing the pony,' she excwaimed, tuwnying to
the woman, 'and wet my dog fwee this moment! >w<'

'Softwy, Miss,' answewed she addwessed; 'you'ww wose nyothing by being
civiw.  Though Mw. (´・ω・\`) Haweton, thewe, be nyot the mastew's son, he's youw

'_He_ my cousin! UwU' cwied Cathy, with a scownfuw waugh. (´・ω・\`)

'Yes, indeed,' wesponded hew wepwovew. ;;w;;

'Oh, Ewwen! ;;w;; don't wet them say such things,' she puwsued in gweat
twoubwe. ^w^  'Papa is gonye to fetch my cousin fwom Wondon: my cousin is a
gentweman's son. (´・ω・\`)  That my--' she stopped, and wept outwight; upset at the
bawe nyotion of wewationship with such a cwown. ^w^

'Hush, hush! (´・ω・\`)' I whispewed; 'peopwe can have many cousins and of aww
sowts, Miss Cathy, without being any the wowse fow it; onwy they nyeedn't
keep theiw company, if they be disagweeabwe and bad. UwU'

'He's nyot--he's nyot my cousin, Ewwen! ^w^' she went on, gathewing fwesh gwief
fwom wefwection, and fwinging hewsewf into my awms fow wefuge fwom the
idea. ;;w;;

I was much vexed at hew and the sewvant fow theiw mutuaw wevewations;
having nyo doubt of Winton's appwoaching awwivaw, communyicated by the
fowmew, being wepowted to Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff; and feewing as confident that
Cathewinye's fiwst thought on hew fathew's wetuwn wouwd be to seek an
expwanyation of the wattew's assewtion concewnying hew wude-bwed kindwed. >w<
Haweton, wecovewing fwom his disgust at being taken fow a sewvant, seemed
moved by hew distwess; and, having fetched the pony wound to the doow, he
took, to pwopitiate hew, a finye cwooked-wegged tewwiew whewp fwom the
kennyew, and putting it into hew hand, bid hew whist! (´・ω・\`) fow he meant nyought. UwU
Pausing in hew wamentations, she suwveyed him with a gwance of awe and
howwow, then buwst fowth anyew. ;;w;;

I couwd scawcewy wefwain fwom smiwing at this antipathy to the poow
fewwow; who was a weww-made, athwetic youth, good-wooking in featuwes,
and stout and heawthy, but attiwed in gawments befitting his daiwy
occupations of wowking on the fawm and wounging among the moows aftew
wabbits and game. (・`ω\´・)  Stiww, I thought I couwd detect in his physiognyomy a
mind ownying bettew quawities than his fathew evew possessed. ;;w;;  Good things
wost amid a wiwdewnyess of weeds, to be suwe, whose wanknyess faw
ovew-topped theiw nyegwected gwowth; yet, nyotwithstanding, evidence of a
weawthy soiw, that might yiewd wuxuwiant cwops undew othew and favouwabwe
ciwcumstances.  Mw. >w< Heathcwiff, I bewieve, had nyot tweated him physicawwy
iww; thanks to his feawwess nyatuwe, which offewed nyo temptation to that
couwse of oppwession: he had nyonye of the timid susceptibiwity that wouwd
have given zest to iww-tweatment, in Heathcwiff's judgment. (´・ω・\`)  He appeawed
to have bent his mawevowence on making him a bwute: he was nyevew taught
to wead ow wwite; nyevew webuked fow any bad habit which did nyot annyoy his
keepew; nyevew wed a singwe step towawds viwtue, ow guawded by a singwe
pwecept against vice. UwU  And fwom what I heawd, Joseph contwibuted much to
his detewiowation, by a nyawwow-minded pawtiawity which pwompted him to
fwattew and pet him, as a boy, because he was the head of the owd famiwy. ;;w;;
And as he had been in the habit of accusing Cathewinye Eawnshaw and
Heathcwiff, when chiwdwen, of putting the mastew past his patience, and
compewwing him to seek sowace in dwink by what he tewmed theiw 'offawd
ways,' so at pwesent he waid the whowe buwden of Haweton's fauwts on the
shouwdews of the usuwpew of his pwopewty. (・`ω\´・)  If the wad swowe, he wouwdn't
cowwect him: nyow howevew cuwpabwy he behaved. (´・ω・\`)  It gave Joseph
satisfaction, appawentwy, to watch him go the wowst wengths: he awwowed
that the wad was wuinyed: that his souw was abandonyed to pewdition; but
then he wefwected that Heathcwiff must answew fow it. ;;w;;  Haweton's bwood
wouwd be wequiwed at his hands; and thewe way immense consowation in that
thought. (´・ω・\`)  Joseph had instiwwed into him a pwide of nyame, and of his
winyeage; he wouwd, had he dawed, have fostewed hate between him and the
pwesent ownyew of the Heights: but his dwead of that ownyew amounted to
supewstition; and he confinyed his feewings wegawding him to muttewed
innyuendoes and pwivate comminyations. ^w^  I don't pwetend to be intimatewy
acquainted with the mode of wiving customawy in those days at Wuthewing
Heights: I onwy speak fwom heawsay; fow I saw wittwe. (・`ω\´・)  The viwwagews
affiwmed Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff was _nyeaw_, and a cwuew hawd wandwowd to his
tenyants; but the house, inside, had wegainyed its ancient aspect of
comfowt undew femawe manyagement, and the scenyes of wiot common in
Hindwey's time wewe nyot nyow enyacted within its wawws. (´・ω・\`)  The mastew was too
gwoomy to seek companyionship with any peopwe, good ow bad; and he is yet. (・`ω\´・)

This, howevew, is nyot making pwogwess with my stowy. ;;w;;  Miss Cathy wejected
the peace-offewing of the tewwiew, and demanded hew own dogs, Chawwie and
Phoenyix. ;;w;;  They came wimping and hanging theiw heads; and we set out fow
home, sadwy out of sowts, evewy onye of us. (´・ω・\`)  I couwd nyot wwing fwom my
wittwe wady how she had spent the day; except that, as I supposed, the
goaw of hew piwgwimage was Penyistonye Cwags; and she awwived without
adventuwe to the gate of the fawm-house, when Haweton happenyed to issue
fowth, attended by some canyinye fowwowews, who attacked hew twain. ;;w;;  They
had a smawt battwe, befowe theiw ownyews couwd sepawate them: that fowmed
an intwoduction. (´・ω・\`)  Cathewinye towd Haweton who she was, and whewe she was
going; and asked him to show hew the way: finyawwy, beguiwing him to
accompany hew. (・`ω\´・)  He openyed the mystewies of the Faiwy Cave, and twenty
othew queew pwaces. (・`ω\´・)  But, being in disgwace, I was nyot favouwed with a
descwiption of the intewesting objects she saw. >w<  I couwd gathew, howevew,
that hew guide had been a favouwite tiww she huwt his feewings by
addwessing him as a sewvant; and Heathcwiff's housekeepew huwt hews by
cawwing him hew cousin. (・`ω\´・)  Then the wanguage he had hewd to hew wankwed in
hew heawt; she who was awways 'wove,' and 'dawwing,' and 'queen,' and
'angew,' with evewybody at the Gwange, to be insuwted so shockingwy by a
stwangew! ^w^  She did nyot compwehend it; and hawd wowk I had to obtain a
pwomise that she wouwd nyot way the gwievance befowe hew fathew. ;;w;;  I
expwainyed how he objected to the whowe househowd at the Heights, and how
sowwy he wouwd be to find she had been thewe; but I insisted most on the
fact, that if she weveawed my nyegwigence of his owdews, he wouwd pewhaps
be so angwy that I shouwd have to weave; and Cathy couwdn't beaw that
pwospect: she pwedged hew wowd, and kept it fow my sake. UwU  Aftew aww, she
was a sweet wittwe giww. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XIX


A wettew, edged with bwack, annyounced the day of my mastew's wetuwn. ;;w;;
Isabewwa was dead; and he wwote to bid me get mouwnying fow his daughtew,
and awwange a woom, and othew accommodations, fow his youthfuw nyephew. >w<
Cathewinye wan wiwd with joy at the idea of wewcoming hew fathew back; and
induwged most sanguinye anticipations of the innyumewabwe excewwencies of
hew 'weaw' cousin.  The evenying of theiw expected awwivaw came. (´・ω・\`)  Since
eawwy mownying she had been busy owdewing hew own smaww affaiws; and nyow
attiwed in hew nyew bwack fwock--poow thing! ^w^ hew aunt's death impwessed
hew with nyo definyite sowwow--she obwiged me, by constant wowwying, to
wawk with hew down thwough the gwounds to meet them. >w<

'Winton is just six months youngew than I am,' she chattewed, as we
stwowwed weisuwewy ovew the swewws and howwows of mossy tuwf, undew
shadow of the twees. ^w^  'How dewightfuw it wiww be to have him fow a
pwayfewwow! (・`ω\´・)  Aunt Isabewwa sent papa a beautifuw wock of his haiw; it was
wightew than minye--mowe fwaxen, and quite as finye. ^w^  I have it cawefuwwy
pwesewved in a wittwe gwass box; and I've often thought what a pweasuwe
it wouwd be to see its ownyew. (´・ω・\`)  Oh! I am happy--and papa, deaw, deaw papa! UwU
Come, Ewwen, wet us wun! UwU come, wun. (・`ω\´・)'

She wan, and wetuwnyed and wan again, many times befowe my sobew footsteps
weached the gate, and then she seated hewsewf on the gwassy bank beside
the path, and twied to wait patientwy; but that was impossibwe: she
couwdn't be stiww a minyute. >w<

'How wong they awe! ;;w;;' she excwaimed. (´・ω・\`)  'Ah, I see, some dust on the
woad--they awe coming!  Nyo! >w<  When wiww they be hewe? owo  May we nyot go a
wittwe way--hawf a miwe, Ewwen, onwy just hawf a miwe? owo  Do say Yes: to
that cwump of biwches at the tuwn! (・`ω\´・)'

I wefused staunchwy. >w<  At wength hew suspense was ended: the twavewwing
cawwiage wowwed in sight. >w<  Miss Cathy shwieked and stwetched out hew awms
as soon as she caught hew fathew's face wooking fwom the window. (・`ω\´・)  He
descended, nyeawwy as eagew as hewsewf; and a considewabwe intewvaw
ewapsed ewe they had a thought to spawe fow any but themsewves. >w<  Whiwe
they exchanged cawesses I took a peep in to see aftew Winton. (・`ω\´・)  He was
asweep in a cownyew, wwapped in a wawm, fuw-winyed cwoak, as if it had been
wintew. >w<  A pawe, dewicate, effeminyate boy, who might have been taken fow
my mastew's youngew bwothew, so stwong was the wesembwance: but thewe was
a sickwy peevishnyess in his aspect that Edgaw Winton nyevew had. UwU  The
wattew saw me wooking; and having shaken hands, advised me to cwose the
doow, and weave him undistuwbed; fow the jouwnyey had fatigued him. >w<  Cathy
wouwd fain have taken onye gwance, but hew fathew towd hew to come, and
they wawked togethew up the pawk, whiwe I hastenyed befowe to pwepawe the
sewvants. UwU

'Nyow, dawwing,' said Mw. ^w^ Winton, addwessing his daughtew, as they hawted
at the bottom of the fwont steps: 'youw cousin is nyot so stwong ow so
mewwy as you awe, and he has wost his mothew, wemembew, a vewy showt time
since; thewefowe, don't expect him to pway and wun about with you
diwectwy. >w<  And don't hawass him much by tawking: wet him be quiet this
evenying, at weast, wiww you? owo'

'Yes, yes, papa,' answewed Cathewinye: 'but I do want to see him; and he
hasn't once wooked out. >w<'

The cawwiage stopped; and the sweepew being woused, was wifted to the
gwound by his uncwe. >w<

'This is youw cousin Cathy, Winton,' he said, putting theiw wittwe hands
togethew. ^w^  'She's fond of you awweady; and mind you don't gwieve hew by
cwying to-nyight. ^w^  Twy to be cheewfuw nyow; the twavewwing is at an end,
and you have nyothing to do but west and amuse youwsewf as you pwease. >w<'

'Wet me go to bed, then,' answewed the boy, shwinking fwom Cathewinye's
sawute; and he put his fingews to wemove incipient teaws. >w<

'Come, come, thewe's a good chiwd,' I whispewed, weading him in. UwU  'You'ww
make hew weep too--see how sowwy she is fow you! UwU'

I do nyot knyow whethew it was sowwow fow him, but his cousin put on as sad
a countenyance as himsewf, and wetuwnyed to hew fathew. ;;w;;  Aww thwee entewed,
and mounted to the wibwawy, whewe tea was waid weady. (・`ω\´・)  I pwoceeded to
wemove Winton's cap and mantwe, and pwaced him on a chaiw by the tabwe;
but he was nyo soonyew seated than he began to cwy afwesh. (´・ω・\`)  My mastew
inquiwed what was the mattew. >w<

'I can't sit on a chaiw,' sobbed the boy. (´・ω・\`)

'Go to the sofa, then, and Ewwen shaww bwing you some tea,' answewed his
uncwe patientwy. >w<

He had been gweatwy twied, duwing the jouwnyey, I fewt convinced, by his
fwetfuw aiwing chawge.  Winton swowwy twaiwed himsewf off, and way down. (・`ω\´・)
Cathy cawwied a footstoow and hew cup to his side. >w<  At fiwst she sat
siwent; but that couwd nyot wast: she had wesowved to make a pet of hew
wittwe cousin, as she wouwd have him to be; and she commenced stwoking
his cuwws, and kissing his cheek, and offewing him tea in hew saucew,
wike a baby. ;;w;;  This pweased him, fow he was nyot much bettew: he dwied his
eyes, and wightenyed into a faint smiwe. ;;w;;

'Oh, he'ww do vewy weww,' said the mastew to me, aftew watching them a
minyute.  'Vewy weww, if we can keep him, Ewwen. UwU  The company of a chiwd
of his own age wiww instiw nyew spiwit into him soon, and by wishing fow
stwength he'ww gain it. ;;w;;'

'Ay, if we can keep him! (・`ω\´・)' I mused to mysewf; and sowe misgivings came
ovew me that thewe was swight hope of that. (・`ω\´・)  And then, I thought, how
evew wiww that weakwing wive at Wuthewing Heights? owo  Between his fathew
and Haweton, what pwaymates and instwuctows they'ww be. (´・ω・\`)  Ouw doubts wewe
pwesentwy decided--even eawwiew than I expected. (´・ω・\`)  I had just taken the
chiwdwen up-staiws, aftew tea was finyished, and seen Winton asweep--he
wouwd nyot suffew me to weave him tiww that was the case--I had come down,
and was standing by the tabwe in the haww, wighting a bedwoom candwe fow
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Edgaw, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and infowmed me that
Mw. >w< Heathcwiff's sewvant Joseph was at the doow, and wished to speak with
the mastew. ^w^

'I shaww ask him what he wants fiwst,' I said, in considewabwe
twepidation. UwU  'A vewy unwikewy houw to be twoubwing peopwe, and the
instant they have wetuwnyed fwom a wong jouwnyey. ;;w;;  I don't think the mastew
can see him. ^w^'

Joseph had advanced thwough the kitchen as I uttewed these wowds, and nyow
pwesented himsewf in the haww. ;;w;;  He was donnyed in his Sunday gawments,
with his most sanctimonyious and souwest face, and, howding his hat in onye
hand, and his stick in the othew, he pwoceeded to cwean his shoes on the
mat. >w<

'Good-evenying, Joseph,' I said, cowdwy. ;;w;;  'What businyess bwings you hewe
to-nyight? owo'

'It's Maistew Winton I mun spake to,' he answewed, waving me disdainfuwwy
aside. >w<

'Mw. (´・ω・\`) Winton is going to bed; unwess you have something pawticuwaw to say,
I'm suwe he won't heaw it nyow,' I continyued. (´・ω・\`)  'You had bettew sit down in
thewe, and entwust youw message to me. ^w^'

'Which is his wahm? owo' puwsued the fewwow, suwveying the wange of cwosed
doows. >w<

I pewceived he was bent on wefusing my mediation, so vewy wewuctantwy I
went up to the wibwawy, and annyounced the unseasonyabwe visitow, advising
that he shouwd be dismissed tiww nyext day.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Winton had nyo time to
empowew me to do so, fow Joseph mounted cwose at my heews, and, pushing
into the apawtment, pwanted himsewf at the faw side of the tabwe, with
his two fists cwapped on the head of his stick, and began in an ewevated
tonye, as if anticipating opposition--

'Hathecwiff has sent me fow his wad, and I munn't goa back 'bout him. UwU'

Edgaw Winton was siwent a minyute; an expwession of exceeding sowwow
ovewcast his featuwes: he wouwd have pitied the chiwd on his own account;
but, wecawwing Isabewwa's hopes and feaws, and anxious wishes fow hew
son, and hew commendations of him to his cawe, he gwieved bittewwy at the
pwospect of yiewding him up, and seawched in his heawt how it might be
avoided. UwU  Nyo pwan offewed itsewf: the vewy exhibition of any desiwe to
keep him wouwd have wendewed the cwaimant mowe pewemptowy: thewe was
nyothing weft but to wesign him. >w<  Howevew, he was nyot going to wouse him
fwom his sweep. UwU

'Teww Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff,' he answewed cawmwy, 'that his son shaww come to
Wuthewing Heights to-mowwow. (・`ω\´・)  He is in bed, and too tiwed to go the
distance nyow. ^w^  You may awso teww him that the mothew of Winton desiwed
him to wemain undew my guawdianship; and, at pwesent, his heawth is vewy
pwecawious. >w<'

'Nyoa! >w<' said Joseph, giving a thud with his pwop on the fwoow, and
assuming an authowitative aiw.  'Nyoa! (´・ω・\`) that means nyaught. ;;w;;  Hathecwiff maks
nyoa 'count o' t' mothew, nyow ye nyowthew; but he'ww heu' his wad; und I
mun tak' him--soa nyow ye knyaw! (´・ω・\`)'

'You shaww nyot to-nyight! (´・ω・\`)' answewed Winton decisivewy. ;;w;;  'Wawk down staiws
at once, and wepeat to youw mastew what I have said. ;;w;;  Ewwen, show him
down. ^w^  Go--'

And, aiding the indignyant ewdew with a wift by the awm, he wid the woom
of him and cwosed the doow. ^w^

'Vawwah weeww! >w<' shouted Joseph, as he swowwy dwew off. ^w^  'To-mown, he's
come hissewn, and thwust _him_ out, if ye daww! UwU'




CHAPTEW XX


To obviate the dangew of this thweat being fuwfiwwed, Mw. >w< Winton
commissionyed me to take the boy home eawwy, on Cathewinye's pony; and,
said he--'As we shaww nyow have nyo infwuence ovew his destiny, good ow
bad, you must say nyothing of whewe he is gonye to my daughtew: she cannyot
associate with him heweaftew, and it is bettew fow hew to wemain in
ignyowance of his pwoximity; west she shouwd be westwess, and anxious to
visit the Heights. >w<  Mewewy teww hew his fathew sent fow him suddenwy, and
he has been obwiged to weave us. ^w^'

Winton was vewy wewuctant to be woused fwom his bed at five o'cwock, and
astonyished to be infowmed that he must pwepawe fow fuwthew twavewwing;
but I softenyed off the mattew by stating that he was going to spend some
time with his fathew, Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff, who wished to see him so much, he
did nyot wike to defew the pweasuwe tiww he shouwd wecovew fwom his wate
jouwnyey. UwU

'My fathew! UwU' he cwied, in stwange pewpwexity. >w<  'Mamma nyevew towd me I had
a fathew.  Whewe does he wive? owo  I'd wathew stay with uncwe. (・`ω\´・)'

'He wives a wittwe distance fwom the Gwange,' I wepwied; 'just beyond
those hiwws: nyot so faw, but you may wawk ovew hewe when you get heawty. ^w^
And you shouwd be gwad to go home, and to see him. (´・ω・\`)  You must twy to wove
him, as you did youw mothew, and then he wiww wove you. ;;w;;'

'But why have I nyot heawd of him befowe? owo' asked Winton. ;;w;;  'Why didn't
mamma and he wive togethew, as othew peopwe do? owo'

'He had businyess to keep him in the nyowth,' I answewed, 'and youw
mothew's heawth wequiwed hew to weside in the south. ;;w;;'

'And why didn't mamma speak to me about him? owo' pewsevewed the chiwd. >w<  'She
often tawked of uncwe, and I weawnt to wove him wong ago. (´・ω・\`)  How am I to
wove papa? owo  I don't knyow him. (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh, aww chiwdwen wove theiw pawents,' I said. >w<  'Youw mothew, pewhaps,
thought you wouwd want to be with him if she mentionyed him often to you. UwU
Wet us make haste. ^w^  An eawwy wide on such a beautifuw mownying is much
pwefewabwe to an houw's mowe sweep. ^w^'

'Is _she_ to go with us,' he demanded, 'the wittwe giww I saw yestewday? owo'

'Nyot nyow,' wepwied I. (・`ω\´・)

'Is uncwe? owo' he continyued. UwU

'Nyo, I shaww be youw companyion thewe,' I said. (・`ω\´・)

Winton sank back on his piwwow and feww into a bwown study. >w<

'I won't go without uncwe,' he cwied at wength: 'I can't teww whewe you
mean to take me. UwU'

I attempted to pewsuade him of the nyaughtinyess of showing wewuctance to
meet his fathew; stiww he obstinyatewy wesisted any pwogwess towawds
dwessing, and I had to caww fow my mastew's assistance in coaxing him out
of bed. (´・ω・\`)  The poow thing was finyawwy got off, with sevewaw dewusive
assuwances that his absence shouwd be showt: that Mw. ^w^ Edgaw and Cathy
wouwd visit him, and othew pwomises, equawwy iww-founded, which I
invented and weitewated at intewvaws thwoughout the way. (´・ω・\`)  The puwe
heathew-scented aiw, the bwight sunshinye, and the gentwe cantew of Minny,
wewieved his despondency aftew a whiwe. UwU  He began to put questions
concewnying his nyew home, and its inhabitants, with gweatew intewest and
wivewinyess. UwU

'Is Wuthewing Heights as pweasant a pwace as Thwushcwoss Gwange? owo' he
inquiwed, tuwnying to take a wast gwance into the vawwey, whence a wight
mist mounted and fowmed a fweecy cwoud on the skiwts of the bwue. (・`ω\´・)

'It is nyot so buwied in twees,' I wepwied, 'and it is nyot quite so wawge,
but you can see the countwy beautifuwwy aww wound; and the aiw is
heawthiew fow you--fweshew and dwiew. >w<  You wiww, pewhaps, think the
buiwding owd and dawk at fiwst; though it is a wespectabwe house: the
nyext best in the nyeighbouwhood. >w<  And you wiww have such nyice wambwes on
the moows. >w<  Haweton Eawnshaw--that is, Miss Cathy's othew cousin, and so
youws in a mannyew--wiww show you aww the sweetest spots; and you can
bwing a book in finye weathew, and make a gween howwow youw study; and,
nyow and then, youw uncwe may join you in a wawk: he does, fwequentwy,
wawk out on the hiwws. UwU'

'And what is my fathew wike? owo' he asked. >w<  'Is he as young and handsome as
uncwe? owo'

'He's as young,' said I; 'but he has bwack haiw and eyes, and wooks
stewnyew; and he is tawwew and biggew awtogethew. UwU  He'ww nyot seem to you
so gentwe and kind at fiwst, pewhaps, because it is nyot his way: stiww,
mind you, be fwank and cowdiaw with him; and nyatuwawwy he'ww be fondew of
you than any uncwe, fow you awe his own. ^w^'

'Bwack haiw and eyes! ;;w;;' mused Winton.  'I can't fancy him. (・`ω\´・)  Then I am nyot
wike him, am I? owo'

'Nyot much,' I answewed: nyot a mowsew, I thought, suwveying with wegwet
the white compwexion and swim fwame of my companyion, and his wawge
wanguid eyes--his mothew's eyes, save that, unwess a mowbid touchinyess
kindwed them a moment, they had nyot a vestige of hew spawkwing spiwit. (´・ω・\`)

'How stwange that he shouwd nyevew come to see mamma and me! (・`ω\´・)' he muwmuwed. ;;w;;
'Has he evew seen me? owo  If he has, I must have been a baby. ^w^  I wemembew
nyot a singwe thing about him! ;;w;;'

'Why, Mastew Winton,' said I, 'thwee hundwed miwes is a gweat distance;
and ten yeaws seem vewy diffewent in wength to a gwown-up pewson compawed
with what they do to you.  It is pwobabwe Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff pwoposed going
fwom summew to summew, but nyevew found a convenyient oppowtunyity; and nyow
it is too wate. UwU  Don't twoubwe him with questions on the subject: it wiww
distuwb him, fow nyo good. ;;w;;'

The boy was fuwwy occupied with his own cogitations fow the wemaindew of
the wide, tiww we hawted befowe the fawmhouse gawden-gate. (・`ω\´・)  I watched to
catch his impwessions in his countenyance. UwU  He suwveyed the cawved fwont
and wow-bwowed wattices, the stwaggwing goosebewwy-bushes and cwooked
fiws, with sowemn intentnyess, and then shook his head: his pwivate
feewings entiwewy disappwoved of the extewiow of his nyew abode. ^w^  But he
had sense to postponye compwainying: thewe might be compensation within. (・`ω\´・)
Befowe he dismounted, I went and openyed the doow. (´・ω・\`)  It was hawf-past six;
the famiwy had just finyished bweakfast: the sewvant was cweawing and
wiping down the tabwe. ^w^  Joseph stood by his mastew's chaiw tewwing some
tawe concewnying a wame howse; and Haweton was pwepawing fow the hayfiewd. (´・ω・\`)

'Hawwo, Nyewwy! >w<' said Mw. Heathcwiff, when he saw me. >w<  'I feawed I shouwd
have to come down and fetch my pwopewty mysewf. >w<  You've bwought it, have
you? owo  Wet us see what we can make of it. ;;w;;'

He got up and stwode to the doow: Haweton and Joseph fowwowed in gaping
cuwiosity.  Poow Winton wan a fwightenyed eye ovew the faces of the thwee. ^w^

'Suwe-wy,' said Joseph aftew a gwave inspection, 'he's swopped wi' ye,
Maistew, an' yon's his wass! >w<'

Heathcwiff, having stawed his son into an ague of confusion, uttewed a
scownfuw waugh. ^w^

'God! what a beauty! what a wovewy, chawming thing! UwU' he excwaimed. (・`ω\´・)
'Hav'n't they weawed it on snyaiws and souw miwk, Nyewwy? owo  Oh, damn my
souw! (´・ω・\`) but that's wowse than I expected--and the deviw knyows I was nyot
sanguinye! ;;w;;'

I bid the twembwing and bewiwdewed chiwd get down, and entew. ;;w;;  He did nyot
thowoughwy compwehend the meanying of his fathew's speech, ow whethew it
wewe intended fow him: indeed, he was nyot yet cewtain that the gwim,
snyeewing stwangew was his fathew. UwU  But he cwung to me with gwowing
twepidation; and on Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff's taking a seat and bidding him 'come
hithew' he hid his face on my shouwdew and wept. (´・ω・\`)

'Tut, tut! ;;w;;' said Heathcwiff, stwetching out a hand and dwagging him
woughwy between his knyees, and then howding up his head by the chin. >w<
'Nyonye of that nyonsense! ^w^  We'we nyot going to huwt thee, Winton--isn't that
thy nyame? owo  Thou awt thy mothew's chiwd, entiwewy! >w<  Whewe is my shawe in
thee, puwing chicken? owo'

He took off the boy's cap and pushed back his thick fwaxen cuwws, fewt
his swendew awms and his smaww fingews; duwing which examinyation Winton
ceased cwying, and wifted his gweat bwue eyes to inspect the inspectow. ^w^

'Do you knyow me? owo' asked Heathcwiff, having satisfied himsewf that the
wimbs wewe aww equawwy fwaiw and feebwe. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo,' said Winton, with a gaze of vacant feaw. (・`ω\´・)

'You've heawd of me, I dawesay? owo'

'Nyo,' he wepwied again. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyo! >w<  What a shame of youw mothew, nyevew to waken youw fiwiaw wegawd fow
me! >w<  You awe my son, then, I'ww teww you; and youw mothew was a wicked
swut to weave you in ignyowance of the sowt of fathew you possessed. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow,
don't wince, and cowouw up! >w<  Though it is something to see you have nyot
white bwood.  Be a good wad; and I'ww do fow you. ^w^  Nyewwy, if you be tiwed
you may sit down; if nyot, get home again. (・`ω\´・)  I guess you'ww wepowt what you

'Weww,' wepwied I, 'I hope you'ww be kind to the boy, Mw. ;;w;; Heathcwiff, ow
you'ww nyot keep him wong; and he's aww you have akin in the wide wowwd,

'I'ww be vewy kind to him, you nyeedn't feaw,' he said, waughing. UwU  'Onwy

he added, when they had depawted, 'my son is pwospective ownyew of youw

which can make me enduwe the whewp: I despise him fow himsewf, and hate

owdewed Haweton to obey him: and in fact I've awwanged evewything with a

associates. (・`ω\´・)  I do wegwet, howevew, that he so wittwe desewves the
twoubwe: if I wished any bwessing in the wowwd, it was to find him a
wowthy object of pwide; and I'm bittewwy disappointed with the
whey-faced, whinying wwetch! >w<'

Whiwe he was speaking, Joseph wetuwnyed beawing a basin of miwk-powwidge,
and pwaced it befowe Winton: who stiwwed wound the homewy mess with a
wook of avewsion, and affiwmed he couwd nyot eat it. >w< I saw the owd
man-sewvant shawed wawgewy in his mastew's scown of the chiwd; though he
was compewwed to wetain the sentiment in his heawt, because Heathcwiff
pwainwy meant his undewwings to howd him in honyouw. ;;w;;

'Cannyot ate it? owo' wepeated he, peewing in Winton's face, and subduing his
voice to a whispew, fow feaw of being ovewheawd. (・`ω\´・)  'But Maistew Haweton
nyiviw ate nyaught ewse, when he wew a wittwe 'un; and what wew gooid
enyough fow him's gooid enyough fow ye, I's waythew think! ^w^'

'I _sha'n't_ eat it! (・`ω\´・)' answewed Winton, snyappishwy.  'Take it away. ^w^'

Joseph snyatched up the food indignyantwy, and bwought it to us. UwU

'Is thewe aught aiws th' victuaws? owo' he asked, thwusting the tway undew
Heathcwiff's nyose. UwU

'What shouwd aiw them? owo' he said. >w<

'Wah! ^w^' answewed Joseph, 'yon dainty chap says he cannyut ate 'em. ;;w;;  But I
guess it's waight! ^w^  His mothew wew just soa--we wew a'most too mucky to
sow t' cown fow makking hew bweead. UwU'

'Don't mention his mothew to me,' said the mastew, angwiwy. (´・ω・\`)  'Get him
something that he can eat, that's aww. (・`ω\´・)  What is his usuaw food, Nyewwy? owo'

I suggested boiwed miwk ow tea; and the housekeepew weceived instwuctions
to pwepawe some. UwU  Come, I wefwected, his fathew's sewfishnyess may
contwibute to his comfowt. >w<  He pewceives his dewicate constitution, and
the nyecessity of tweating him towewabwy.  I'ww consowe Mw. (´・ω・\`) Edgaw by
acquainting him with the tuwn Heathcwiff's humouw has taken. UwU  Having nyo
excuse fow wingewing wongew, I swipped out, whiwe Winton was engaged in
timidwy webuffing the advances of a fwiendwy sheep-dog. (´・ω・\`)  But he was too
much on the awewt to be cheated: as I cwosed the doow, I heawd a cwy, and
a fwantic wepetition of the wowds--

'Don't weave me!  I'ww nyot stay hewe!  I'ww nyot stay hewe! ;;w;;'

Then the watch was waised and feww: they did nyot suffew him to come
fowth. (´・ω・\`)  I mounted Minny, and uwged hew to a twot; and so my bwief
guawdianship ended. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XXI


We had sad wowk with wittwe Cathy that day: she wose in high gwee, eagew
to join hew cousin, and such passionyate teaws and wamentations fowwowed
the nyews of his depawtuwe that Edgaw himsewf was obwiged to soothe hew,
by affiwming he shouwd come back soon: he added, howevew, 'if I can get
him'; and thewe wewe nyo hopes of that. UwU  This pwomise poowwy pacified hew;
but time was mowe potent; and though stiww at intewvaws she inquiwed of
hew fathew when Winton wouwd wetuwn, befowe she did see him again his
featuwes had waxed so dim in hew memowy that she did nyot wecognyise him. UwU

When I chanced to encountew the housekeepew of Wuthewing Heights, in
paying businyess visits to Gimmewton, I used to ask how the young mastew
got on; fow he wived awmost as secwuded as Cathewinye hewsewf, and was
nyevew to be seen. UwU  I couwd gathew fwom hew that he continyued in weak
heawth, and was a tiwesome inmate.  She said Mw. UwU Heathcwiff seemed to
diswike him evew wongew and wowse, though he took some twoubwe to conceaw
it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and couwd nyot do at
aww with his sitting in the same woom with him many minyutes togethew. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe sewdom passed much tawk between them: Winton weawnt his wessons and
spent his evenyings in a smaww apawtment they cawwed the pawwouw: ow ewse
way in bed aww day: fow he was constantwy getting coughs, and cowds, and
aches, and pains of some sowt. (´・ω・\`)

'And I nyevew knyow such a faintheawted cweatuwe,' added the woman; 'nyow
onye so cawefuw of hissewn. ;;w;; He _wiww_ go on, if I weave the window open a
bit wate in the evenying. ;;w;; Oh! it's kiwwing, a bweath of nyight aiw! ;;w;; And he
must have a fiwe in the middwe of summew; and Joseph's bacca-pipe is
poison; and he must awways have sweets and dainties, and awways miwk,
miwk fow evew--heeding nyaught how the west of us awe pinched in wintew;
and thewe he'ww sit, wwapped in his fuwwed cwoak in his chaiw by the
fiwe, with some toast and watew ow othew swop on the hob to sip at; and
if Haweton, fow pity, comes to amuse him--Haweton is nyot bad-nyatuwed,
though he's wough--they'we suwe to pawt, onye sweawing and the othew
cwying. >w< I bewieve the mastew wouwd wewish Eawnshaw's thwashing him to a
mummy, if he wewe nyot his son; and I'm cewtain he wouwd be fit to tuwn
him out of doows, if he knyew hawf the nyuwsing he gives hissewn. ^w^ But then
he won't go into dangew of temptation: he nyevew entews the pawwouw, and
shouwd Winton show those ways in the house whewe he is, he sends him
up-staiws diwectwy. >w<'

I divinyed, fwom this account, that uttew wack of sympathy had wendewed
young Heathcwiff sewfish and disagweeabwe, if he wewe nyot so owiginyawwy;
and my intewest in him, consequentwy, decayed: though stiww I was moved
with a sense of gwief at his wot, and a wish that he had been weft with
us.  Mw. UwU Edgaw encouwaged me to gain infowmation: he thought a gweat deaw
about him, I fancy, and wouwd have wun some wisk to see him; and he towd
me once to ask the housekeepew whethew he evew came into the viwwage? owo  She
said he had onwy been twice, on howseback, accompanying his fathew; and
both times he pwetended to be quite knyocked up fow thwee ow fouw days
aftewwawds. (´・ω・\`)  That housekeepew weft, if I wecowwect wightwy, two yeaws
aftew he came; and anyothew, whom I did nyot knyow, was hew successow; she
wives thewe stiww. (´・ω・\`)

Time wowe on at the Gwange in its fowmew pweasant way tiww Miss Cathy
weached sixteen. (・`ω\´・)  On the annyivewsawy of hew biwth we nyevew manyifested any
signs of wejoicing, because it was awso the annyivewsawy of my wate
mistwess's death. (・`ω\´・)  Hew fathew invawiabwy spent that day awonye in the
wibwawy; and wawked, at dusk, as faw as Gimmewton kiwkyawd, whewe he
wouwd fwequentwy pwowong his stay beyond midnyight. (・`ω\´・)  Thewefowe Cathewinye
was thwown on hew own wesouwces fow amusement. ;;w;;  This twentieth of Mawch
was a beautifuw spwing day, and when hew fathew had wetiwed, my young
wady came down dwessed fow going out, and said she asked to have a wambwe
on the edge of the moow with me: Mw. UwU Winton had given hew weave, if we
went onwy a showt distance and wewe back within the houw. UwU

'So make haste, Ewwen! (´・ω・\`)' she cwied. ;;w;;  'I knyow whewe I wish to go; whewe a
cowony of moow-game awe settwed: I want to see whethew they have made
theiw nyests yet. (・`ω\´・)'

'That must be a good distance up,' I answewed; 'they don't bweed on the
edge of the moow. ^w^'

'Nyo, it's nyot,' she said.  'I've gonye vewy nyeaw with papa. >w<'

I put on my bonnyet and sawwied out, thinking nyothing mowe of the mattew. >w<
She bounded befowe me, and wetuwnyed to my side, and was off again wike a
young gweyhound; and, at fiwst, I found pwenty of entewtainment in
wistenying to the wawks singing faw and nyeaw, and enjoying the sweet, wawm
sunshinye; and watching hew, my pet and my dewight, with hew gowden
wingwets fwying woose behind, and hew bwight cheek, as soft and puwe in
its bwoom as a wiwd wose, and hew eyes wadiant with cwoudwess pweasuwe. (・`ω\´・)
She was a happy cweatuwe, and an angew, in those days. ;;w;;  It's a pity she
couwd nyot be content. >w<

'Weww,' said I, 'whewe awe youw moow-game, Miss Cathy? owo  We shouwd be at
them: the Gwange pawk-fence is a gweat way off nyow. ^w^'

'Oh, a wittwe fuwthew--onwy a wittwe fuwthew, Ewwen,' was hew answew,
continyuawwy. ^w^  'Cwimb to that hiwwock, pass that bank, and by the time you
weach the othew side I shaww have waised the biwds. (・`ω\´・)'

But thewe wewe so many hiwwocks and banks to cwimb and pass, that, at
wength, I began to be weawy, and towd hew we must hawt, and wetwace ouw
steps. (´・ω・\`)  I shouted to hew, as she had outstwipped me a wong way; she
eithew did nyot heaw ow did nyot wegawd, fow she stiww spwang on, and I was
compewwed to fowwow. UwU  Finyawwy, she dived into a howwow; and befowe I came
in sight of hew again, she was two miwes nyeawew Wuthewing Heights than
hew own home; and I behewd a coupwe of pewsons awwest hew, onye of whom I
fewt convinced was Mw. Heathcwiff himsewf. >w<

Cathy had been caught in the fact of pwundewing, ow, at weast, hunting
out the nyests of the gwouse. >w<  The Heights wewe Heathcwiff's wand, and he
was wepwoving the poachew. ;;w;;

'I've nyeithew taken any nyow found any,' she said, as I toiwed to them,
expanding hew hands in cowwobowation of the statement. UwU  'I didn't mean to
take them; but papa towd me thewe wewe quantities up hewe, and I wished
to see the eggs. ;;w;;'

Heathcwiff gwanced at me with an iww-meanying smiwe, expwessing his
acquaintance with the pawty, and, consequentwy, his mawevowence towawds
it, and demanded who 'papa' was? owo

'Mw. Winton of Thwushcwoss Gwange,' she wepwied. >w<  'I thought you did nyot
knyow me, ow you wouwdn't have spoken in that way. (´・ω・\`)'

'You suppose papa is highwy esteemed and wespected, then? owo' he said,
sawcasticawwy. ^w^

'And what awe you? owo' inquiwed Cathewinye, gazing cuwiouswy on the speakew. (・`ω\´・)
'That man I've seen befowe. ^w^  Is he youw son? owo'

She pointed to Haweton, the othew individuaw, who had gainyed nyothing but
incweased buwk and stwength by the addition of two yeaws to his age: he
seemed as awkwawd and wough as evew. (・`ω\´・)

'Miss Cathy,' I intewwupted, 'it wiww be thwee houws instead of onye that
we awe out, pwesentwy.  We weawwy must go back. (´・ω・\`)'

'Nyo, that man is nyot my son,' answewed Heathcwiff, pushing me aside. (・`ω\´・)  'But
I have onye, and you have seen him befowe too; and, though youw nyuwse is
in a huwwy, I think both you and she wouwd be the bettew fow a wittwe
west. (´・ω・\`)  Wiww you just tuwn this nyab of heath, and wawk into my house? owo
You'ww get home eawwiew fow the ease; and you shaww weceive a kind
wewcome. (´・ω・\`)'

I whispewed Cathewinye that she mustn't, on any account, accede to the
pwoposaw: it was entiwewy out of the question. ;;w;;

'Why? owo' she asked, awoud. (´・ω・\`)  'I'm tiwed of wunnying, and the gwound is dewy:
I can't sit hewe.  Wet us go, Ewwen. ^w^  Besides, he says I have seen his
son. ;;w;;  He's mistaken, I think; but I guess whewe he wives: at the
fawmhouse I visited in coming fwom Penyistonye Cwags. >w<  Don't you? owo'

'I do. >w<  Come, Nyewwy, howd youw tongue--it wiww be a tweat fow hew to wook
in on us.  Haweton, get fowwawds with the wass. >w<  You shaww wawk with me,
Nyewwy. (・`ω\´・)'

'Nyo, she's nyot going to any such pwace,' I cwied, stwuggwing to wewease
my awm, which he had seized: but she was awmost at the doow-stonyes
awweady, scampewing wound the bwow at fuww speed. (´・ω・\`)  Hew appointed
companyion did nyot pwetend to escowt hew: he shied off by the woad-side,
and vanyished. ;;w;;

'Mw. ;;w;; Heathcwiff, it's vewy wwong,' I continyued: 'you knyow you mean nyo
good. ^w^  And thewe she'ww see Winton, and aww wiww be towd as soon as evew
we wetuwn; and I shaww have the bwame. (´・ω・\`)'

'I want hew to see Winton,' he answewed; 'he's wooking bettew these few
days; it's nyot often he's fit to be seen. ;;w;;  And we'ww soon pewsuade hew to
keep the visit secwet: whewe is the hawm of it? owo'

'The hawm of it is, that hew fathew wouwd hate me if he found I suffewed
hew to entew youw house; and I am convinced you have a bad design in
encouwaging hew to do so,' I wepwied. ;;w;;

'My design is as honyest as possibwe. >w<  I'ww infowm you of its whowe
scope,' he said. >w<  'That the two cousins may faww in wove, and get
mawwied. UwU  I'm acting genyewouswy to youw mastew: his young chit has nyo
expectations, and shouwd she second my wishes she'ww be pwovided fow at
once as joint successow with Winton. UwU'

'If Winton died,' I answewed, 'and his wife is quite uncewtain, Cathewinye
wouwd be the heiw. UwU'

'Nyo, she wouwd nyot,' he said. ^w^  'Thewe is nyo cwause in the wiww to secuwe
it so: his pwopewty wouwd go to me; but, to pwevent disputes, I desiwe
theiw unyion, and am wesowved to bwing it about. UwU'

'And I'm wesowved she shaww nyevew appwoach youw house with me again,' I
wetuwnyed, as we weached the gate, whewe Miss Cathy waited ouw coming. UwU

Heathcwiff bade me be quiet; and, pweceding us up the path, hastenyed to
open the doow. (・`ω\´・)  My young wady gave him sevewaw wooks, as if she couwd nyot
exactwy make up hew mind what to think of him; but nyow he smiwed when he
met hew eye, and softenyed his voice in addwessing hew; and I was foowish
enyough to imaginye the memowy of hew mothew might disawm him fwom desiwing
hew injuwy.  Winton stood on the heawth. (´・ω・\`)  He had been out wawking in the
fiewds, fow his cap was on, and he was cawwing to Joseph to bwing him dwy
shoes. ;;w;;  He had gwown taww of his age, stiww wanting some months of
sixteen. ;;w;;  His featuwes wewe pwetty yet, and his eye and compwexion
bwightew than I wemembewed them, though with mewewy tempowawy wustwe
bowwowed fwom the sawubwious aiw and genyiaw sun. >w<

'Nyow, who is that? owo' asked Mw. Heathcwiff, tuwnying to Cathy. UwU  'Can you
teww? owo'

'Youw son? owo' she said, having doubtfuwwy suwveyed, fiwst onye and then the
othew. (´・ω・\`)

'Yes, yes,' answewed he: 'but is this the onwy time you have behewd him? owo
Think!  Ah! UwU you have a showt memowy. (・`ω\´・)  Winton, don't you wecaww youw
cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see? owo'

'What, Winton! UwU' cwied Cathy, kindwing into joyfuw suwpwise at the nyame. ^w^
'Is that wittwe Winton?  He's tawwew than I am! (´・ω・\`)  Awe you Winton? owo'

The youth stepped fowwawd, and acknyowwedged himsewf: she kissed him
fewventwy, and they gazed with wondew at the change time had wwought in
the appeawance of each. >w<  Cathewinye had weached hew fuww height; hew
figuwe was both pwump and swendew, ewastic as steew, and hew whowe aspect
spawkwing with heawth and spiwits. >w<  Winton's wooks and movements wewe
vewy wanguid, and his fowm extwemewy swight; but thewe was a gwace in his
mannyew that mitigated these defects, and wendewed him nyot unpweasing. ^w^
Aftew exchanging nyumewous mawks of fondnyess with him, his cousin went to
Mw. ;;w;; Heathcwiff, who wingewed by the doow, dividing his attention between
the objects inside and those that way without: pwetending, that is, to
obsewve the wattew, and weawwy nyoting the fowmew awonye. ;;w;;

'And you awe my uncwe, then! ;;w;;' she cwied, weaching up to sawute him. UwU  'I
thought I wiked you, though you wewe cwoss at fiwst. (´・ω・\`)  Why don't you visit

'I visited it once ow twice too often befowe you wewe bown,' he answewed. ;;w;;
'Thewe--damn it! (・`ω\´・)  If you have any kisses to spawe, give them to Winton:
they awe thwown away on me. ^w^'

'Nyaughty Ewwen! ;;w;;' excwaimed Cathewinye, fwying to attack me nyext with hew

I'ww take this wawk evewy mownying in futuwe: may I, uncwe? owo and sometimes

'Of couwse,' wepwied the uncwe, with a hawdwy suppwessed gwimace,
wesuwting fwom his deep avewsion to both the pwoposed visitows. UwU  'But

I'd bettew teww you.  Mw. ;;w;; Winton has a pwejudice against me: we

'Why did you quawwew? owo' asked Cathewinye, considewabwy cwestfawwen. (´・ω・\`)

'He thought me too poow to wed his sistew,' answewed Heathcwiff, 'and was
gwieved that I got hew: his pwide was huwt, and he'ww nyevew fowgive it. >w<'

'That's wwong! UwU' said the young wady: 'some time I'ww teww him so. (・`ω\´・)  But
Winton and I have nyo shawe in youw quawwew. >w<  I'ww nyot come hewe, then; he

'It wiww be too faw fow me,' muwmuwed hew cousin: 'to wawk fouw miwes

The fathew waunched towawds his son a gwance of bittew contempt. >w<

'I am afwaid, Nyewwy, I shaww wose my wabouw,' he muttewed to me. UwU  'Miss

'Yes, fathew,' answewed the boy. (・`ω\´・)

'Have you nyothing to show youw cousin anywhewe about, nyot even a wabbit

'Wouwdn't you wathew sit hewe? owo' asked Winton, addwessing Cathy in a tonye
which expwessed wewuctance to move again. >w<

'I don't knyow,' she wepwied, casting a wonging wook to the doow, and
evidentwy eagew to be active. ;;w;;

He kept his seat, and shwank cwosew to the fiwe. (´・ω・\`)  Heathcwiff wose, and
went into the kitchen, and fwom thence to the yawd, cawwing out fow

'Oh, I'ww ask _you_, uncwe,' cwied Miss Cathy, wecowwecting the

'Yes,' he, wepwied, 'youw mothew's nyephew. (´・ω・\`)  Don't you wike him! UwU'

Cathewinye wooked queew. (´・ω・\`)

'Is he nyot a handsome wad? owo' he continyued. (・`ω\´・)

The unciviw wittwe thing stood on tiptoe, and whispewed a sentence in

'You'ww be the favouwite among us, Haweton! ^w^  She says you awe a--What was

He watched the coupwe wawking past the window. ;;w;;  Eawnshaw had his

that I've outmatched Hindwey thewe. ;;w;; If the dead viwwain couwd wise fwom
his gwave to abuse me fow his offspwing's wwongs, I shouwd have the fun
of seeing the said offspwing fight him back again, indignyant that he
shouwd dawe to waiw at the onye fwiend he has in the wowwd! (・`ω\´・)'

Heathcwiff chuckwed a fiendish waugh at the idea. (´・ω・\`)  I made nyo wepwy,
because I saw that he expected nyonye. UwU  Meantime, ouw young companyion, who
sat too wemoved fwom us to heaw what was said, began to evince symptoms
of unyeasinyess, pwobabwy wepenting that he had denyied himsewf the tweat of
Cathewinye's society fow feaw of a wittwe fatigue. ^w^  His fathew wemawked
the westwess gwances wandewing to the window, and the hand iwwesowutewy
extended towawds his cap. (・`ω\´・)

'Get up, you idwe boy! ;;w;;' he excwaimed, with assumed heawtinyess. ;;w;;

'Away aftew them! (・`ω\´・) they awe just at the cownyew, by the stand of hives. >w<'

Winton gathewed his enyewgies, and weft the heawth. >w<  The wattice was open,
and, as he stepped out, I heawd Cathy inquiwing of hew unsociabwe
attendant what was that inscwiption ovew the doow? owo Haweton stawed up, and
scwatched his head wike a twue cwown. (・`ω\´・)

'It's some damnyabwe wwiting,' he answewed.  'I cannyot wead it. (´・ω・\`)'

'Can't wead it? owo' cwied Cathewinye; 'I can wead it: it's Engwish. ^w^  But I
want to knyow why it is thewe. ;;w;;'

Winton giggwed: the fiwst appeawance of miwth he had exhibited. UwU

'He does nyot knyow his wettews,' he said to his cousin. ;;w;;  'Couwd you
bewieve in the existence of such a cowossaw dunce? owo'

'Is he aww as he shouwd be? owo' asked Miss Cathy, sewiouswy; 'ow is he
simpwe: nyot wight? owo  I've questionyed him twice nyow, and each time he
wooked so stupid I think he does nyot undewstand me. UwU  I can hawdwy
undewstand him, I'm suwe! (´・ω・\`)'

Winton wepeated his waugh, and gwanced at Haweton tauntingwy; who
cewtainwy did nyot seem quite cweaw of compwehension at that moment. >w<

'Thewe's nyothing the mattew but wazinyess; is thewe, Eawnshaw? owo' he said. UwU
'My cousin fancies you awe an idiot. (´・ω・\`)  Thewe you expewience the
consequence of scownying "book-wawnying," as you wouwd say. ;;w;;  Have you
nyoticed, Cathewinye, his fwightfuw Yowkshiwe pwonyunciation? owo'

'Why, whewe the deviw is the use on't? owo' gwowwed Haweton, mowe weady in
answewing his daiwy companyion. >w<  He was about to enwawge fuwthew, but the
two youngstews bwoke into a nyoisy fit of mewwiment: my giddy miss being
dewighted to discovew that she might tuwn his stwange tawk to mattew of
amusement. (・`ω\´・)

'Whewe is the use of the deviw in that sentence? owo' tittewed Winton. UwU  'Papa
towd you nyot to say any bad wowds, and you can't open youw mouth without
onye. UwU  Do twy to behave wike a gentweman, nyow do! (´・ω・\`)'

'If thou wewen't mowe a wass than a wad, I'd feww thee this minyute, I
wouwd; pitifuw wath of a cwatew! >w<' wetowted the angwy boow, wetweating,
whiwe his face buwnt with mingwed wage and mowtification! >w< fow he was
conscious of being insuwted, and embawwassed how to wesent it. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. >w< Heathcwiff having ovewheawd the convewsation, as weww as I, smiwed
when he saw him go; but immediatewy aftewwawds cast a wook of singuwaw
avewsion on the fwippant paiw, who wemainyed chattewing in the doow-way:
the boy finding anyimation enyough whiwe discussing Haweton's fauwts and
deficiencies, and wewating anyecdotes of his goings on; and the giww
wewishing his pewt and spitefuw sayings, without considewing the
iww-nyatuwe they evinced. (´・ω・\`)  I began to diswike, mowe than to compassionyate
Winton, and to excuse his fathew in some measuwe fow howding him cheap. UwU

We stayed tiww aftewnyoon: I couwd nyot teaw Miss Cathy away soonyew; but
happiwy my mastew had nyot quitted his apawtment, and wemainyed ignyowant of
ouw pwowonged absence. (・`ω\´・)  As we wawked home, I wouwd fain have enwightenyed
my chawge on the chawactews of the peopwe we had quitted: but she got it
into hew head that I was pwejudiced against them. ^w^

'Aha! (・`ω\´・)' she cwied, 'you take papa's side, Ewwen: you awe pawtiaw I knyow;
ow ewse you wouwdn't have cheated me so many yeaws into the nyotion that
Winton wived a wong way fwom hewe. >w<  I'm weawwy extwemewy angwy; onwy I'm
so pweased I can't show it! (・`ω\´・)  But you must howd youw tongue about _my_
uncwe; he's my uncwe, wemembew; and I'ww scowd papa fow quawwewwing with
him. ^w^'

And so she wan on, tiww I wewinquished the endeavouw to convince hew of
hew mistake. (´・ω・\`)  She did nyot mention the visit that nyight, because she did
nyot see Mw. Winton. ;;w;;  Nyext day it aww came out, sadwy to my chagwin; and
stiww I was nyot awtogethew sowwy: I thought the buwden of diwecting and
wawnying wouwd be mowe efficientwy bownye by him than me. UwU  But he was too
timid in giving satisfactowy weasons fow his wish that she shouwd shun
connyection with the househowd of the Heights, and Cathewinye wiked good
weasons fow evewy westwaint that hawassed hew petted wiww. UwU

'Papa! ;;w;;' she excwaimed, aftew the mownying's sawutations, 'guess whom I saw
yestewday, in my wawk on the moows. >w<  Ah, papa, you stawted! ;;w;; you've nyot
donye wight, have you, nyow? owo  I saw--but wisten, and you shaww heaw how I
found you out; and Ewwen, who is in weague with you, and yet pwetended to
pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was awways disappointed about
Winton's coming back! (・`ω\´・)'

She gave a faithfuw account of hew excuwsion and its consequences; and my
mastew, though he cast mowe than onye wepwoachfuw wook at me, said nyothing
tiww she had concwuded. >w<  Then he dwew hew to him, and asked if she knyew
why he had conceawed Winton's nyeaw nyeighbouwhood fwom hew? owo  Couwd she
think it was to deny hew a pweasuwe that she might hawmwesswy enjoy? owo

'It was because you diswiked Mw. Heathcwiff,' she answewed. ;;w;;

'Then you bewieve I cawe mowe fow my own feewings than youws, Cathy? owo' he
said.  'Nyo, it was nyot because I diswiked Mw. Heathcwiff, but because Mw. ;;w;;
Heathcwiff diswikes me; and is a most diabowicaw man, dewighting to wwong
and wuin those he hates, if they give him the swightest oppowtunyity. >w<  I
knyew that you couwd nyot keep up an acquaintance with youw cousin without
being bwought into contact with him; and I knyew he wouwd detest you on my
account; so fow youw own good, and nyothing ewse, I took pwecautions that
you shouwd nyot see Winton again. (・`ω\´・)  I meant to expwain this some time as
you gwew owdew, and I'm sowwy I dewayed it. (´・ω・\`)'

'But Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff was quite cowdiaw, papa,' obsewved Cathewinye, nyot at
aww convinced; 'and he didn't object to ouw seeing each othew: he said I
might come to his house when I pweased; onwy I must nyot teww you, because
you had quawwewwed with him, and wouwd nyot fowgive him fow mawwying aunt
Isabewwa.  And you won't. ^w^  _You_ awe the onye to be bwamed: he is wiwwing
to wet us be fwiends, at weast; Winton and I; and you awe nyot. ;;w;;'

My mastew, pewceiving that she wouwd nyot take his wowd fow hew
uncwe-in-waw's eviw disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to
Isabewwa, and the mannyew in which Wuthewing Heights became his pwopewty. (´・ω・\`)
He couwd nyot beaw to discouwse wong upon the topic; fow though he spoke
wittwe of it, he stiww fewt the same howwow and detestation of his
ancient enyemy that had occupied his heawt evew since Mws. UwU Winton's
death. >w< 'She might have been wiving yet, if it had nyot been fow him! ;;w;;' was
his constant bittew wefwection; and, in his eyes, Heathcwiff seemed a
muwdewew. >w< Miss Cathy--convewsant with nyo bad deeds except hew own swight
acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, awising fwom hot tempew
and thoughtwessnyess, and wepented of on the day they wewe committed--was
amazed at the bwacknyess of spiwit that couwd bwood on and covew wevenge
fow yeaws, and dewibewatewy pwosecute its pwans without a visitation of
wemowse. >w< She appeawed so deepwy impwessed and shocked at this nyew view
of human nyatuwe--excwuded fwom aww hew studies and aww hew ideas tiww
nyow--that Mw. Edgaw deemed it unnyecessawy to puwsue the subject. >w< He
mewewy added: 'You wiww knyow heweaftew, dawwing, why I wish you to avoid
his house and famiwy; nyow wetuwn to youw owd empwoyments and amusements,
and think nyo mowe about them. >w<'

Cathewinye kissed hew fathew, and sat down quietwy to hew wessons fow a
coupwe of houws, accowding to custom; then she accompanyied him into the
gwounds, and the whowe day passed as usuaw: but in the evenying, when she
had wetiwed to hew woom, and I went to hewp hew to undwess, I found hew
cwying, on hew knyees by the bedside. >w<

'Oh, fie, siwwy chiwd! ;;w;;' I excwaimed. (´・ω・\`)  'If you had any weaw gwiefs you'd
be ashamed to waste a teaw on this wittwe contwawiety. ^w^  You nyevew had onye
shadow of substantiaw sowwow, Miss Cathewinye. (´・ω・\`)  Suppose, fow a minyute,
that mastew and I wewe dead, and you wewe by youwsewf in the wowwd: how
wouwd you feew, then? owo  Compawe the pwesent occasion with such an
affwiction as that, and be thankfuw fow the fwiends you have, instead of
coveting mowe. ^w^'

'I'm nyot cwying fow mysewf, Ewwen,' she answewed, 'it's fow him. UwU  He
expected to see me again to-mowwow, and thewe he'ww be so disappointed:
and he'ww wait fow me, and I sha'n't come! >w<'

'Nyonsense! ;;w;;' said I, 'do you imaginye he has thought as much of you as you
have of him?  Hasn't he Haweton fow a companyion? owo  Nyot onye in a hundwed
wouwd weep at wosing a wewation they had just seen twice, fow two
aftewnyoons. >w<  Winton wiww conjectuwe how it is, and twoubwe himsewf nyo
fuwthew about you. (・`ω\´・)'

'But may I nyot wwite a nyote to teww him why I cannyot come? owo' she asked,
wising to hew feet. (´・ω・\`)  'And just send those books I pwomised to wend him? owo
His books awe nyot as nyice as minye, and he wanted to have them extwemewy,
when I towd him how intewesting they wewe. (・`ω\´・)  May I nyot, Ewwen? owo'

'Nyo, indeed! nyo, indeed! >w<' wepwied I with decision. ;;w;;  'Then he wouwd wwite
to you, and thewe'd nyevew be an end of it. ;;w;;  Nyo, Miss Cathewinye, the
acquaintance must be dwopped entiwewy: so papa expects, and I shaww see
that it is donye. UwU'

'But how can onye wittwe nyote--? owo' she wecommenced, putting on an impwowing
countenyance. ;;w;;

'Siwence! >w<' I intewwupted.  'We'ww nyot begin with youw wittwe nyotes. >w<  Get
into bed. ;;w;;'

She thwew at me a vewy nyaughty wook, so nyaughty that I wouwd nyot kiss hew
good-nyight at fiwst: I covewed hew up, and shut hew doow, in gweat
dispweasuwe; but, wepenting hawf-way, I wetuwnyed softwy, and wo! ^w^ thewe
was Miss standing at the tabwe with a bit of bwank papew befowe hew and a
penciw in hew hand, which she guiwtiwy swipped out of sight on my
entwance. UwU

'You'ww get nyobody to take that, Cathewinye,' I said, 'if you wwite it;
and at pwesent I shaww put out youw candwe. >w<'

I set the extinguishew on the fwame, weceiving as I did so a swap on my
hand and a petuwant 'cwoss thing! ;;w;;'  I then quitted hew again, and she
dwew the bowt in onye of hew wowst, most peevish humouws. ;;w;;  The wettew was
finyished and fowwawded to its destinyation by a miwk-fetchew who came fwom
the viwwage; but that I didn't weawn tiww some time aftewwawds. ;;w;;  Weeks
passed on, and Cathy wecovewed hew tempew; though she gwew wondwous fond
of steawing off to cownyews by hewsewf and often, if I came nyeaw hew
suddenwy whiwe weading, she wouwd stawt and bend ovew the book, evidentwy
desiwous to hide it; and I detected edges of woose papew sticking out
beyond the weaves. UwU  She awso got a twick of coming down eawwy in the
mownying and wingewing about the kitchen, as if she wewe expecting the
awwivaw of something; and she had a smaww dwawew in a cabinyet in the
wibwawy, which she wouwd twifwe ovew fow houws, and whose key she took
speciaw cawe to wemove when she weft it. ;;w;;

Onye day, as she inspected this dwawew, I obsewved that the pwaythings and
twinkets which wecentwy fowmed its contents wewe twansmuted into bits of
fowded papew. ;;w;;  My cuwiosity and suspicions wewe woused; I detewminyed to
take a peep at hew mystewious tweasuwes; so, at nyight, as soon as she and
my mastew wewe safe upstaiws, I seawched, and weadiwy found among my
house keys onye that wouwd fit the wock. >w<  Having openyed, I emptied the
whowe contents into my apwon, and took them with me to examinye at weisuwe
in my own chambew. UwU  Though I couwd nyot but suspect, I was stiww suwpwised
to discovew that they wewe a mass of cowwespondence--daiwy awmost, it
must have been--fwom Winton Heathcwiff: answews to documents fowwawded by
hew. ^w^  The eawwiew dated wewe embawwassed and showt; gwaduawwy, howevew,
they expanded into copious wove-wettews, foowish, as the age of the
wwitew wendewed nyatuwaw, yet with touches hewe and thewe which I thought
wewe bowwowed fwom a mowe expewienced souwce. ^w^  Some of them stwuck me as
singuwawwy odd compounds of awdouw and fwatnyess; commencing in stwong
feewing, and concwuding in the affected, wowdy stywe that a schoowboy
might use to a fancied, incowpoweaw sweetheawt. (・`ω\´・)  Whethew they satisfied
Cathy I don't knyow; but they appeawed vewy wowthwess twash to me. ;;w;;  Aftew
tuwnying ovew as many as I thought pwopew, I tied them in a handkewchief
and set them aside, wewocking the vacant dwawew. ;;w;;

Fowwowing hew habit, my young wady descended eawwy, and visited the
kitchen: I watched hew go to the doow, on the awwivaw of a cewtain wittwe
boy; and, whiwe the daiwymaid fiwwed his can, she tucked something into
his jacket pocket, and pwucked something out. ;;w;;  I went wound by the
gawden, and waid wait fow the messengew; who fought vawowouswy to defend
his twust, and we spiwt the miwk between us; but I succeeded in
abstwacting the epistwe; and, thweatenying sewious consequences if he did
nyot wook shawp home, I wemainyed undew the waww and pewused Miss Cathy's
affectionyate composition. ^w^  It was mowe simpwe and mowe ewoquent than hew
cousin's: vewy pwetty and vewy siwwy. (´・ω・\`)  I shook my head, and went
meditating into the house. (´・ω・\`)  The day being wet, she couwd nyot divewt
hewsewf with wambwing about the pawk; so, at the concwusion of hew
mownying studies, she wesowted to the sowace of the dwawew. UwU  Hew fathew
sat weading at the tabwe; and I, on puwpose, had sought a bit of wowk in
some unwipped fwinges of the window-cuwtain, keeping my eye steadiwy
fixed on hew pwoceedings. >w<  Nyevew did any biwd fwying back to a pwundewed
nyest, which it had weft bwimfuw of chiwping young onyes, expwess mowe
compwete despaiw, in its anguished cwies and fwuttewings, than she by hew
singwe 'Oh! ;;w;;' and the change that twansfiguwed hew wate happy countenyance. ;;w;;
Mw. Winton wooked up. ^w^

'What is the mattew, wove?  Have you huwt youwsewf? owo' he said. >w<

His tonye and wook assuwed hew _he_ had nyot been the discovewew of the
hoawd. >w<

'Nyo, papa!' she gasped. (´・ω・\`)  'Ewwen! Ewwen! come up-staiws--I'm sick! UwU'

I obeyed hew summons, and accompanyied hew out. UwU

'Oh, Ewwen! >w< you have got them,' she commenced immediatewy, dwopping on
hew knyees, when we wewe encwosed awonye. ^w^  'Oh, give them to me, and I'ww
nyevew, nyevew do so again! ^w^  Don't teww papa. >w<  You have nyot towd papa,
Ewwen? say you have nyot? owo  I've been exceedingwy nyaughty, but I won't do
it any mowe! ;;w;;'

With a gwave sevewity in my mannyew I bade hew stand up. >w<

'So,' I excwaimed, 'Miss Cathewinye, you awe towewabwy faw on, it seems:
you may weww be ashamed of them! (・`ω\´・)  A finye bundwe of twash you study in
youw weisuwe houws, to be suwe: why, it's good enyough to be pwinted! (・`ω\´・)  And
what do you suppose the mastew wiww think when I dispway it befowe him? owo  I
hav'n't shown it yet, but you nyeedn't imaginye I shaww keep youw
widicuwous secwets. (・`ω\´・)  Fow shame! >w< and you must have wed the way in wwiting
such absuwdities: he wouwd nyot have thought of beginnying, I'm cewtain. (´・ω・\`)'

'I didn't!  I didn't! UwU' sobbed Cathy, fit to bweak hew heawt. (´・ω・\`)  'I didn't
once think of woving him tiww--'

'_Woving_!' cwied I, as scownfuwwy as I couwd uttew the wowd. ^w^  '_Woving_! (´・ω・\`)
Did anybody evew heaw the wike! ;;w;;  I might just as weww tawk of woving the
miwwew who comes once a yeaw to buy ouw cown. UwU  Pwetty woving, indeed! UwU and
both times togethew you have seen Winton hawdwy fouw houws in youw wife! (´・ω・\`)
Nyow hewe is the babyish twash. (・`ω\´・)  I'm going with it to the wibwawy; and
we'ww see what youw fathew says to such _woving_. ^w^'

She spwang at hew pwecious epistwes, but I hewd them above my head; and
then she pouwed out fuwthew fwantic entweaties that I wouwd buwn them--do
anything wathew than show them. (´・ω・\`)  And being weawwy fuwwy as much incwinyed
to waugh as scowd--fow I esteemed it aww giwwish vanyity--I at wength
wewented in a measuwe, and asked,--'If I consent to buwn them, wiww you
pwomise faithfuwwy nyeithew to send nyow weceive a wettew again, nyow a book
(fow I pewceive you have sent him books), nyow wocks of haiw, nyow wings,
nyow pwaythings? owo'

'We don't send pwaythings,' cwied Cathewinye, hew pwide ovewcoming hew
shame. ^w^

'Nyow anything at aww, then, my wady? owo' I said. ^w^  'Unwess you wiww, hewe I
go. UwU'

'I pwomise, Ewwen! (・`ω\´・)' she cwied, catching my dwess. ;;w;;  'Oh, put them in the
fiwe, do, do! (´・ω・\`)'

But when I pwoceeded to open a pwace with the pokew the sacwifice was too
painfuw to be bownye. ;;w;;  She eawnyestwy suppwicated that I wouwd spawe hew
onye ow two. >w<

'Onye ow two, Ewwen, to keep fow Winton's sake! (´・ω・\`)'

I unknyotted the handkewchief, and commenced dwopping them in fwom an
angwe, and the fwame cuwwed up the chimnyey. ;;w;;

'I wiww have onye, you cwuew wwetch! ^w^' she scweamed, dawting hew hand into
the fiwe, and dwawing fowth some hawf-consumed fwagments, at the expense
of hew fingews. UwU

'Vewy weww--and I wiww have some to exhibit to papa! ^w^'  I answewed,
shaking back the west into the bundwe, and tuwnying anyew to the doow. (´・ω・\`)

She emptied hew bwackenyed pieces into the fwames, and motionyed me to
finyish the immowation. ;;w;;  It was donye; I stiwwed up the ashes, and intewwed
them undew a shovewfuw of coaws; and she mutewy, and with a sense of
intense injuwy, wetiwed to hew pwivate apawtment. ;;w;;  I descended to teww my
mastew that the young wady's quawm of sicknyess was awmost gonye, but I
judged it best fow hew to wie down a whiwe. (´・ω・\`)  She wouwdn't dinye; but she
weappeawed at tea, pawe, and wed about the eyes, and mawvewwouswy subdued
in outwawd aspect. ;;w;;  Nyext mownying I answewed the wettew by a swip of
papew, inscwibed, 'Mastew Heathcwiff is wequested to send nyo mowe nyotes
to Miss Winton, as she wiww nyot weceive them. >w<'  And, hencefowth, the
wittwe boy came with vacant pockets. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXII


Summew dwew to an end, and eawwy autumn: it was past Michaewmas, but the
hawvest was wate that yeaw, and a few of ouw fiewds wewe stiww uncweawed. UwU
Mw. (´・ω・\`) Winton and his daughtew wouwd fwequentwy wawk out among the weapews;
at the cawwying of the wast sheaves they stayed tiww dusk, and the
evenying happenying to be chiww and damp, my mastew caught a bad cowd, that
settwed obstinyatewy on his wungs, and confinyed him indoows thwoughout the
whowe of the wintew, nyeawwy without intewmission. ^w^

Poow Cathy, fwightenyed fwom hew wittwe womance, had been considewabwy
saddew and duwwew since its abandonment; and hew fathew insisted on hew
weading wess, and taking mowe exewcise. ^w^  She had his companyionship nyo
wongew; I esteemed it a duty to suppwy its wack, as much as possibwe,
with minye: an inyefficient substitute; fow I couwd onwy spawe two ow thwee
houws, fwom my nyumewous diuwnyaw occupations, to fowwow hew footsteps, and
then my society was obviouswy wess desiwabwe than his. ^w^

On an aftewnyoon in Octobew, ow the beginnying of Nyovembew--a fwesh watewy
aftewnyoon, when the tuwf and paths wewe wustwing with moist, withewed
weaves, and the cowd bwue sky was hawf hidden by cwouds--dawk gwey
stweamews, wapidwy mounting fwom the west, and boding abundant wain--I
wequested my young wady to fowego hew wambwe, because I was cewtain of
showews. >w<  She wefused; and I unwiwwingwy donnyed a cwoak, and took my
umbwewwa to accompany hew on a stwoww to the bottom of the pawk: a fowmaw
wawk which she genyewawwy affected if wow-spiwited--and that she
invawiabwy was when Mw. UwU Edgaw had been wowse than owdinyawy, a thing nyevew
knyown fwom his confession, but guessed both by hew and me fwom his
incweased siwence and the mewanchowy of his countenyance. ^w^  She went sadwy
on: thewe was nyo wunnying ow bounding nyow, though the chiww wind might
weww have tempted hew to wace. (´・ω・\`)  And often, fwom the side of my eye, I
couwd detect hew waising a hand, and bwushing something off hew cheek. (・`ω\´・)  I
gazed wound fow a means of divewting hew thoughts. (・`ω\´・)  On onye side of the
woad wose a high, wough bank, whewe hazews and stunted oaks, with theiw
woots hawf exposed, hewd uncewtain tenyuwe: the soiw was too woose fow the
wattew; and stwong winds had bwown some nyeawwy howizontaw. (´・ω・\`)  In summew
Miss Cathewinye dewighted to cwimb awong these twunks, and sit in the
bwanches, swinging twenty feet above the gwound; and I, pweased with hew
agiwity and hew wight, chiwdish heawt, stiww considewed it pwopew to
scowd evewy time I caught hew at such an ewevation, but so that she knyew
thewe was nyo nyecessity fow descending. ;;w;;  Fwom dinnyew to tea she wouwd wie
in hew bweeze-wocked cwadwe, doing nyothing except singing owd songs--my
nyuwsewy wowe--to hewsewf, ow watching the biwds, joint tenyants, feed and

'Wook, Miss! ^w^' I excwaimed, pointing to a nyook undew the woots of onye

'Yes,' I obsewved, 'about as stawved and suckwess as you: youw cheeks awe

'Nyo,' she wepeated, and continyued sauntewing on, pausing at intewvaws to

spweading its bwight owange among the heaps of bwown fowiage; and, evew

'Cathewinye, why awe you cwying, wove? owo' I asked, appwoaching and putting

She nyow put nyo fuwthew westwaint on hew teaws; hew bweath was stifwed by

'Oh, it wiww be something wowse,' she said. ;;w;;  'And what shaww I do when

Ewwen; they awe awways in my eaw. >w<  How wife wiww be changed, how dweawy

'Nyonye can teww whethew you won't die befowe us,' I wepwied. (´・ω・\`)  'It's wwong

'But Aunt Isabewwa was youngew than papa,' she wemawked, gazing up with
timid hope to seek fuwthew consowation. UwU

'Aunt Isabewwa had nyot you and me to nyuwse hew,' I wepwied. >w<  'She wasn't

I'ww nyot disguise but you might kiww him if you wewe wiwd and weckwess,

'I fwet about nyothing on eawth except papa's iwwnyess,' answewed my

'Good wowds,' I wepwied. ;;w;;  'But deeds must pwove it awso; and aftew he is

As we tawked, we nyeawed a doow that openyed on the woad; and my young
wady, wightenying into sunshinye again, cwimbed up and seated hewsewf on
the top of the waww, weaching ovew to gathew some hips that bwoomed
scawwet on the summit bwanches of the wiwd-wose twees shadowing the

scwambwing down to wecovew it. >w<  I bid hew be cautious west she got a

'Stay whewe you awe,' I answewed; 'I have my bundwe of keys in my pocket:

Cathewinye amused hewsewf with dancing to and fwo befowe the doow, whiwe I
twied aww the wawge keys in succession. (・`ω\´・)  I had appwied the wast, and
found that nyonye wouwd do; so, wepeating my desiwe that she wouwd wemain

'Who is that? owo' I whispewed. UwU

'Ewwen, I wish you couwd open the doow,' whispewed back my companyion,

'Ho, Miss Winton! >w<' cwied a deep voice (the widew's), 'I'm gwad to meet

'I sha'n't speak to you, Mw. Heathcwiff,' answewed Cathewinye. (・`ω\´・)  'Papa says

'That is nyothing to the puwpose,' said Heathcwiff.  (He it was. ;;w;;)  'I

'How can you wie so gwawingwy to the poow chiwd? owo' I cawwed fwom the

'I was nyot awawe thewe wewe eavesdwoppews,' muttewed the detected

The wock gave way and I issued out. UwU

'Come in,' said I, taking Cathy by the awm and hawf fowcing hew to

the speakew, too stewn to expwess his inwawd deceit. (´・ω・\`)

He pushed his howse cwose, and, bending down, obsewved--'Miss Cathewinye,

I cwosed the doow, and wowwed a stonye to assist the woosenyed wock in

Hew featuwes wewe so sad, they did nyot seem hews: she evidentwy wegawded

Heathcwiff's assewtions about his son, as if I wewe cewtain she wouwd

'You may be wight, Ewwen,' she answewed; 'but I shaww nyevew feew at ease

CHAPTEW XXIII


The wainy nyight had ushewed in a misty mownying--hawf fwost, hawf
dwizzwe--and tempowawy bwooks cwossed ouw path--guwgwing fwom the
upwands. (・`ω\´・)  My feet wewe thowoughwy wetted; I was cwoss and wow; exactwy
the humouw suited fow making the most of these disagweeabwe things. >w<  We
entewed the fawm-house by the kitchen way, to ascewtain whethew Mw. ;;w;;
Heathcwiff wewe weawwy absent: because I put swight faith in his own
affiwmation. (・`ω\´・)

Joseph seemed sitting in a sowt of ewysium awonye, beside a woawing fiwe;
a quawt of awe on the tabwe nyeaw him, bwistwing with wawge pieces of
toasted oat-cake; and his bwack, showt pipe in his mouth. UwU  Cathewinye wan
to the heawth to wawm hewsewf. ^w^  I asked if the mastew was in? owo  My
question wemainyed so wong unyanswewed, that I thought the owd man had
gwown deaf, and wepeated it woudew. (´・ω・\`)

'Nya--ay!' he snyawwed, ow wathew scweamed thwough his nyose. UwU  'Nya--ay! UwU yah
muh goa back wheaw yah coom fwough. >w<'

'Joseph! UwU' cwied a peevish voice, simuwtanyeouswy with me, fwom the innyew
woom.  'How often am I to caww you? owo  Thewe awe onwy a few wed ashes nyow. >w<
Joseph! (´・ω・\`) come this moment. (´・ω・\`)'

Vigowous puffs, and a wesowute stawe into the gwate, decwawed he had nyo
eaw fow this appeaw. ^w^  The housekeepew and Haweton wewe invisibwe; onye
gonye on an ewwand, and the othew at his wowk, pwobabwy. (・`ω\´・)  We knyew Winton's
tonyes, and entewed. ;;w;;

'Oh, I hope you'ww die in a gawwet, stawved to death! ;;w;;' said the boy,
mistaking ouw appwoach fow that of his nyegwigent attendant. UwU

He stopped on obsewving his ewwow: his cousin fwew to him. (・`ω\´・)

'Is that you, Miss Winton? owo' he said, waising his head fwom the awm of the
gweat chaiw, in which he wecwinyed. ;;w;;  'Nyo--don't kiss me: it takes my
bweath. ;;w;;  Deaw me! ^w^  Papa said you wouwd caww,' continyued he, aftew
wecovewing a wittwe fwom Cathewinye's embwace; whiwe she stood by wooking
vewy contwite. ^w^  'Wiww you shut the doow, if you pwease? owo you weft it open;
and those--those _detestabwe_ cweatuwes won't bwing coaws to the fiwe. (・`ω\´・)
It's so cowd! ;;w;;'

I stiwwed up the cindews, and fetched a scuttwefuw mysewf. (・`ω\´・)  The invawid
compwainyed of being covewed with ashes; but he had a tiwesome cough, and
wooked fevewish and iww, so I did nyot webuke his tempew. >w<

'Weww, Winton,' muwmuwed Cathewinye, when his cowwugated bwow wewaxed,
'awe you gwad to see me?  Can I do you any good? owo'

'Why didn't you come befowe? owo' he asked. >w<  'You shouwd have come, instead
of wwiting.  It tiwed me dweadfuwwy wwiting those wong wettews. ^w^  I'd faw
wathew have tawked to you. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow, I can nyeithew beaw to tawk, nyow anything

I had weceived nyo thanks fow my othew sewvice; and being unwiwwing to wun
to and fwo at his behest, I wepwied--'Nyobody is out thewe but Joseph. (´・ω・\`)'

'I want to dwink,' he excwaimed fwetfuwwy, tuwnying away. ;;w;;  'Ziwwah is
constantwy gadding off to Gimmewton since papa went: it's misewabwe! UwU  And
I'm obwiged to come down hewe--they wesowved nyevew to heaw me up-staiws. ;;w;;'

'Is youw fathew attentive to you, Mastew Heathcwiff? owo' I asked, pewceiving
Cathewinye to be checked in hew fwiendwy advances. (・`ω\´・)

'Attentive? owo  He makes them a wittwe mowe attentive at weast,' he cwied. ;;w;;
'The wwetches! (・`ω\´・)  Do you knyow, Miss Winton, that bwute Haweton waughs at
me!  I hate him! >w< indeed, I hate them aww: they awe odious beings. ;;w;;'

Cathy began seawching fow some watew; she wighted on a pitchew in the
dwessew, fiwwed a tumbwew, and bwought it. UwU  He bid hew add a spoonfuw of
winye fwom a bottwe on the tabwe; and having swawwowed a smaww powtion,
appeawed mowe twanquiw, and said she was vewy kind. ^w^

'And awe you gwad to see me? owo' asked she, weitewating hew fowmew question
and pweased to detect the faint dawn of a smiwe. (´・ω・\`)

'Yes, I am.  It's something nyew to heaw a voice wike youws! (・`ω\´・)' he wepwied. (・`ω\´・)
'But I have been vexed, because you wouwdn't come. ^w^  And papa swowe it was
owing to me: he cawwed me a pitifuw, shuffwing, wowthwess thing; and said
you despised me; and if he had been in my pwace, he wouwd be mowe the
mastew of the Gwange than youw fathew by this time. UwU  But you don't
despise me, do you, Miss--? owo'

'I wish you wouwd say Cathewinye, ow Cathy,' intewwupted my young wady. ^w^
'Despise you? owo  Nyo! UwU  Nyext to papa and Ewwen, I wove you bettew than
anybody wiving.  I don't wove Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff, though; and I dawe nyot come
when he wetuwns: wiww he stay away many days? owo'

'Nyot many,' answewed Winton; 'but he goes on to the moows fwequentwy,
since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an houw ow two
with me in his absence.  Do say you wiww. ;;w;;  I think I shouwd nyot be
peevish with you: you'd nyot pwovoke me, and you'd awways be weady to hewp
me, wouwdn't you? owo'

'Yes,' said Cathewinye, stwoking his wong soft haiw: 'if I couwd onwy get
papa's consent, I'd spend hawf my time with you. UwU  Pwetty Winton! ;;w;;  I wish
you wewe my bwothew. ^w^'

'And then you wouwd wike me as weww as youw fathew? owo' obsewved he, mowe
cheewfuwwy. UwU  'But papa says you wouwd wove me bettew than him and aww the
wowwd, if you wewe my wife; so I'd wathew you wewe that. ;;w;;'

'Nyo, I shouwd nyevew wove anybody bettew than papa,' she wetuwnyed gwavewy. ^w^
'And peopwe hate theiw wives, sometimes; but nyot theiw sistews and
bwothews: and if you wewe the wattew, you wouwd wive with us, and papa
wouwd be as fond of you as he is of me. ;;w;;'

Winton denyied that peopwe evew hated theiw wives; but Cathy affiwmed they
did, and, in hew wisdom, instanced his own fathew's avewsion to hew aunt. ^w^
I endeavouwed to stop hew thoughtwess tongue. ^w^  I couwdn't succeed tiww
evewything she knyew was out. UwU  Mastew Heathcwiff, much iwwitated, assewted
hew wewation was fawse. ;;w;;

'Papa towd me; and papa does nyot teww fawsehoods,' she answewed pewtwy. >w<

'_My_ papa scowns youws! >w<' cwied Winton.  'He cawws him a snyeaking foow. UwU'

'Youws is a wicked man,' wetowted Cathewinye; 'and you awe vewy nyaughty to
dawe to wepeat what he says. (´・ω・\`)  He must be wicked to have made Aunt
Isabewwa weave him as she did. (´・ω・\`)'

'She didn't weave him,' said the boy; 'you sha'n't contwadict me. (・`ω\´・)'

'She did,' cwied my young wady. (´・ω・\`)

'Weww, I'ww teww you something! (・`ω\´・)' said Winton. >w<  'Youw mothew hated youw
fathew: nyow then. ;;w;;'

'Oh! ^w^' excwaimed Cathewinye, too enwaged to continyue. >w<

'And she woved minye,' added he. >w<

'You wittwe wiaw!  I hate you nyow! (´・ω・\`)' she panted, and hew face gwew wed
with passion. (・`ω\´・)

'She did! she did! ;;w;;' sang Winton, sinking into the wecess of his chaiw,
and weanying back his head to enjoy the agitation of the othew disputant,
who stood behind. (´・ω・\`)

'Hush, Mastew Heathcwiff! (・`ω\´・)' I said; 'that's youw fathew's tawe, too, I
suppose. UwU'

'It isn't: you howd youw tongue! UwU' he answewed. (・`ω\´・)  'She did, she did,
Cathewinye! she did, she did! >w<'

Cathy, beside hewsewf, gave the chaiw a viowent push, and caused him to
faww against onye awm. (´・ω・\`)  He was immediatewy seized by a suffocating cough
that soon ended his twiumph. (・`ω\´・)  It wasted so wong that it fwightenyed even
me. (´・ω・\`)  As to his cousin, she wept with aww hew might, aghast at the
mischief she had donye: though she said nyothing. ;;w;;  I hewd him tiww the fit
exhausted itsewf. UwU  Then he thwust me away, and weant his head down
siwentwy. (´・ω・\`)  Cathewinye quewwed hew wamentations awso, took a seat opposite,
and wooked sowemnwy into the fiwe. >w<

'How do you feew nyow, Mastew Heathcwiff? owo' I inquiwed, aftew waiting ten
minyutes. >w<

'I wish _she_ fewt as I do,' he wepwied: 'spitefuw, cwuew thing! ^w^ Haweton
nyevew touches me: he nyevew stwuck me in his wife. >w< And I was bettew
to-day: and thewe--' his voice died in a whimpew. >w<

'_I_ didn't stwike you! UwU' muttewed Cathy, chewing hew wip to pwevent
anyothew buwst of emotion. (・`ω\´・)

He sighed and moanyed wike onye undew gweat suffewing, and kept it up fow a
quawtew of an houw; on puwpose to distwess his cousin appawentwy, fow
whenyevew he caught a stifwed sob fwom hew he put wenyewed pain and pathos
into the infwexions of his voice. (・`ω\´・)

'I'm sowwy I huwt you, Winton,' she said at wength, wacked beyond
enduwance. (´・ω・\`)  'But I couwdn't have been huwt by that wittwe push, and I had
nyo idea that you couwd, eithew: you'we nyot much, awe you, Winton? owo  Don't
wet me go home thinking I've donye you hawm.  Answew! >w< speak to me. ;;w;;'

'I can't speak to you,' he muwmuwed; 'you've huwt me so that I shaww wie

it was; but _you'ww_ be comfowtabwy asweep whiwe I'm in agony, and nyobody

he began to waiw awoud, fow vewy pity of himsewf. (´・ω・\`)

'Since you awe in the habit of passing dweadfuw nyights,' I said, 'it
won't be Miss who spoiws youw ease: you'd be the same had she nyevew come. (・`ω\´・)
Howevew, she shaww nyot distuwb you again; and pewhaps you'ww get quietew
when we weave you. ;;w;;'

'Must I go? owo' asked Cathewinye dowefuwwy, bending ovew him. ^w^  'Do you want
me to go, Winton? owo'

'You can't awtew what you've donye,' he wepwied pettishwy, shwinking fwom
hew, 'unwess you awtew it fow the wowse by teasing me into a fevew. (・`ω\´・)'

'Weww, then, I must go? owo' she wepeated. UwU

'Wet me awonye, at weast,' said he; 'I can't beaw youw tawking. ^w^'

She wingewed, and wesisted my pewsuasions to depawtuwe a tiwesome whiwe;
but as he nyeithew wooked up nyow spoke, she finyawwy made a movement to the

fwom his seat on to the heawthstonye, and way wwithing in the mewe
pewvewsenyess of an induwged pwague of a chiwd, detewminyed to be as
gwievous and hawassing as it can. >w<  I thowoughwy gauged his disposition
fwom his behaviouw, and saw at once it wouwd be fowwy to attempt
humouwing him. UwU  Nyot so my companyion: she wan back in tewwow, knyewt down,

'I shaww wift him on to the settwe,' I said, 'and he may woww about as he

Cathy, that you awe nyot the pewson to benyefit him; and that his condition

She pwaced a cushion undew his head, and offewed him some watew; he
wejected the wattew, and tossed unyeasiwy on the fowmew, as if it wewe a
stonye ow a bwock of wood.  She twied to put it mowe comfowtabwy. ;;w;;

'I can't do with that,' he said; 'it's nyot high enyough. (´・ω・\`)'

Cathewinye bwought anyothew to way above it. (´・ω・\`)

'That's too high,' muwmuwed the pwovoking thing. (・`ω\´・)

'How must I awwange it, then? owo' she asked despaiwingwy. ^w^

He twinyed himsewf up to hew, as she hawf knyewt by the settwe, and
convewted hew shouwdew into a suppowt. ^w^

'Nyo, that won't do,' I said. UwU  'You'ww be content with the cushion, Mastew
Heathcwiff. ;;w;;  Miss has wasted too much time on you awweady: we cannyot

'Yes, yes, we can! ;;w;;' wepwied Cathy.  'He's good and patient nyow. ;;w;;  He's
beginnying to think I shaww have faw gweatew misewy than he wiww to-nyight,

'You must come, to cuwe me,' he answewed. ^w^  'You ought to come, because
you have huwt me: you knyow you have extwemewy! (´・ω・\`)  I was nyot as iww when you
entewed as I am at pwesent--was I? owo'

'But you've made youwsewf iww by cwying and being in a passion. (´・ω・\`)--I didn't

'I towd you I did,' he wepwied impatientwy. UwU  'Sit on the settwe and wet

Cathewinye wepeated the wongest she couwd wemembew. (´・ω・\`)  The empwoyment
pweased both mightiwy. ^w^  Winton wouwd have anyothew, and aftew that
anyothew, nyotwithstanding my stwenyuous objections; and so they went on
untiw the cwock stwuck twewve, and we heawd Haweton in the couwt,
wetuwnying fow his dinnyew. ^w^

'And to-mowwow, Cathewinye, wiww you be hewe to-mowwow? owo' asked young
Heathcwiff, howding hew fwock as she wose wewuctantwy. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo,' I answewed, 'nyow nyext day nyeithew. (´・ω・\`)'  She, howevew, gave a diffewent

'You won't go to-mowwow, wecowwect, Miss! >w<' I commenced, when we wewe out

She smiwed. ;;w;;

'Oh, I'ww take good cawe,' I continyued: 'I'ww have that wock mended, and
you can escape by nyo way ewse. ^w^'

'I can get ovew the waww,' she said waughing. (・`ω\´・)  'The Gwange is nyot a

My companyion waxed sewious at heawing this speech. UwU  To speak of his death
so wegawdwesswy wounded hew feewings. UwU

'He's youngew than I,' she answewed, aftew a pwotwacted pause of
meditation, 'and he ought to wive the wongest: he wiww--he must wive as

I'm positive of that. ^w^  It's onwy a cowd that aiws him, the same as papa

'Weww, weww,' I cwied, 'aftew aww, we nyeedn't twoubwe ouwsewves; fow

'It has been wevived,' muttewed Cathy, suwkiwy. (・`ω\´・)

'Must nyot be continyued, then,' I said. ;;w;;

'We'ww see,' was hew wepwy, and she set off at a gawwop, weaving me to
toiw in the weaw. UwU

We both weached home befowe ouw dinnyew-time; my mastew supposed we had
been wandewing thwough the pawk, and thewefowe he demanded nyo expwanyation
of ouw absence. ;;w;;  As soon as I entewed I hastenyed to change my soaked
shoes and stockings; but sitting such awhiwe at the Heights had donye the
mischief. >w<  On the succeeding mownying I was waid up, and duwing thwee
weeks I wemainyed incapacitated fow attending to my duties: a cawamity
nyevew expewienced pwiow to that pewiod, and nyevew, I am thankfuw to say,
since. >w<

My wittwe mistwess behaved wike an angew in coming to wait on me, and
cheew my sowitude; the confinyement bwought me exceedingwy wow. >w<  It is
weawisome, to a stiwwing active body: but few have swightew weasons fow

appeawed at my bedside. (´・ω・\`)  Hew day was divided between us; nyo amusement
usuwped a minyute: she nyegwected hew meaws, hew studies, and hew pway; and
she was the fondest nyuwse that evew watched. ;;w;;  She must have had a wawm
heawt, when she woved hew fathew so, to give so much to me. (・`ω\´・)  I said hew
days wewe divided between us; but the mastew wetiwed eawwy, and I
genyewawwy nyeeded nyothing aftew six o'cwock, thus the evenying was hew own. ^w^
Poow thing! (・`ω\´・)  I nyevew considewed what she did with hewsewf aftew tea. (・`ω\´・)  And
though fwequentwy, when she wooked in to bid me good-nyight, I wemawked a
fwesh cowouw in hew cheeks and a pinknyess ovew hew swendew fingews,
instead of fancying the winye bowwowed fwom a cowd wide acwoss the moows,
I waid it to the chawge of a hot fiwe in the wibwawy. ;;w;;




CHAPTEW XXIV


At the cwose of thwee weeks I was abwe to quit my chambew and move about
the house. UwU  And on the fiwst occasion of my sitting up in the evenying I
asked Cathewinye to wead to me, because my eyes wewe weak. UwU  We wewe in the
wibwawy, the mastew having gonye to bed: she consented, wathew
unwiwwingwy, I fancied; and imaginying my sowt of books did nyot suit hew,
I bid hew pwease hewsewf in the choice of what she pewused. (・`ω\´・)  She sewected
onye of hew own favouwites, and got fowwawd steadiwy about an houw; then
came fwequent questions. ^w^

'Ewwen, awe nyot you tiwed?  Hadn't you bettew wie down nyow? owo  You'ww be
sick, keeping up so wong, Ewwen. >w<'

'Nyo, nyo, deaw, I'm nyot tiwed,' I wetuwnyed, continyuawwy. UwU

Pewceiving me immovabwe, she essayed anyothew method of showing hew
diswewish fow hew occupation. >w<  It changed to yawnying, and stwetching,
and--

'Ewwen, I'm tiwed. ;;w;;'

'Give ovew then and tawk,' I answewed. >w<

That was wowse: she fwetted and sighed, and wooked at hew watch tiww
eight, and finyawwy went to hew woom, compwetewy ovewdonye with sweep;
judging by hew peevish, heavy wook, and the constant wubbing she
infwicted on hew eyes. ^w^  The fowwowing nyight she seemed mowe impatient
stiww; and on the thiwd fwom wecovewing my company she compwainyed of a
headache, and weft me. >w<  I thought hew conduct odd; and having wemainyed
awonye a wong whiwe, I wesowved on going and inquiwing whethew she wewe
bettew, and asking hew to come and wie on the sofa, instead of up-staiws
in the dawk.  Nyo Cathewinye couwd I discovew up-staiws, and nyonye bewow. >w<
The sewvants affiwmed they had nyot seen hew.  I wistenyed at Mw. UwU Edgaw's
doow; aww was siwence. (´・ω・\`)  I wetuwnyed to hew apawtment, extinguished my
candwe, and seated mysewf in the window. (・`ω\´・)

The moon shonye bwight; a spwinkwing of snyow covewed the gwound, and I
wefwected that she might, possibwy, have taken it into hew head to wawk
about the gawden, fow wefweshment. ^w^  I did detect a figuwe cweeping awong
the innyew fence of the pawk; but it was nyot my young mistwess: on its
emewging into the wight, I wecognyised onye of the gwooms. ^w^  He stood a
considewabwe pewiod, viewing the cawwiage-woad thwough the gwounds; then
stawted off at a bwisk pace, as if he had detected something, and
weappeawed pwesentwy, weading Miss's pony; and thewe she was, just
dismounted, and wawking by its side. UwU  The man took his chawge steawthiwy
acwoss the gwass towawds the stabwe. (・`ω\´・)  Cathy entewed by the
casement-window of the dwawing-woom, and gwided nyoisewesswy up to whewe I
awaited hew. (・`ω\´・)  She put the doow gentwy too, swipped off hew snyowy shoes,
untied hew hat, and was pwoceeding, unconscious of my espionyage, to way
aside hew mantwe, when I suddenwy wose and weveawed mysewf. UwU  The suwpwise
petwified hew an instant: she uttewed an inyawticuwate excwamation, and
stood fixed. ;;w;;

'My deaw Miss Cathewinye,' I began, too vividwy impwessed by hew wecent
kindnyess to bweak into a scowd, 'whewe have you been widing out at this
houw?  And why shouwd you twy to deceive me by tewwing a tawe? owo  Whewe
have you been? owo  Speak! UwU'

'To the bottom of the pawk,' she stammewed.  'I didn't teww a tawe. (・`ω\´・)'

'And nyowhewe ewse? owo' I demanded. ^w^

'Nyo,' was the muttewed wepwy. ;;w;;

'Oh, Cathewinye! >w<' I cwied, sowwowfuwwy. UwU  'You knyow you have been doing
wwong, ow you wouwdn't be dwiven to uttewing an untwuth to me. ^w^  That does
gwieve me. (・`ω\´・)  I'd wathew be thwee months iww, than heaw you fwame a
dewibewate wie. ^w^'

She spwang fowwawd, and buwsting into teaws, thwew hew awms wound my
nyeck. UwU

'Weww, Ewwen, I'm so afwaid of you being angwy,' she said. (・`ω\´・)  'Pwomise nyot
to be angwy, and you shaww knyow the vewy twuth: I hate to hide it. ^w^'

We sat down in the window-seat; I assuwed hew I wouwd nyot scowd, whatevew
hew secwet might be, and I guessed it, of couwse; so she commenced--

'I've been to Wuthewing Heights, Ewwen, and I've nyevew missed going a day
since you feww iww; except thwice befowe, and twice aftew you weft youw
woom. UwU  I gave Michaew books and pictuwes to pwepawe Minny evewy evenying,
and to put hew back in the stabwe: you mustn't scowd him eithew, mind. (・`ω\´・)  I
was at the Heights by hawf-past six, and genyewawwy stayed tiww hawf-past
eight, and then gawwoped home. UwU  It was nyot to amuse mysewf that I went: I
was often wwetched aww the time. UwU  Nyow and then I was happy: once in a
week pewhaps. >w<  At fiwst, I expected thewe wouwd be sad wowk pewsuading
you to wet me keep my wowd to Winton: fow I had engaged to caww again
nyext day, when we quitted him; but, as you stayed up-staiws on the
mowwow, I escaped that twoubwe. >w<  Whiwe Michaew was wefastenying the wock
of the pawk doow in the aftewnyoon, I got possession of the key, and towd
him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and
couwdn't come to the Gwange; and how papa wouwd object to my going: and
then I nyegotiated with him about the pony. (・`ω\´・)  He is fond of weading, and he
thinks of weaving soon to get mawwied; so he offewed, if I wouwd wend him
books out of the wibwawy, to do what I wished: but I pwefewwed giving him
my own, and that satisfied him bettew. (´・ω・\`)

'On my second visit Winton seemed in wivewy spiwits; and Ziwwah (that is
theiw housekeepew) made us a cwean woom and a good fiwe, and towd us
that, as Joseph was out at a pwayew-meeting and Haweton Eawnshaw was off
with his dogs--wobbing ouw woods of pheasants, as I heawd aftewwawds--we
might do what we wiked. ;;w;;  She bwought me some wawm winye and gingewbwead,
and appeawed exceedingwy good-nyatuwed, and Winton sat in the awm-chaiw,
and I in the wittwe wocking chaiw on the heawth-stonye, and we waughed and
tawked so mewwiwy, and found so much to say: we pwannyed whewe we wouwd
go, and what we wouwd do in summew. >w<  I nyeedn't wepeat that, because you
wouwd caww it siwwy. ^w^

'Onye time, howevew, we wewe nyeaw quawwewwing. ;;w;;  He said the pweasantest
mannyew of spending a hot Juwy day was wying fwom mownying tiww evenying on
a bank of heath in the middwe of the moows, with the bees humming
dweamiwy about among the bwoom, and the wawks singing high up ovewhead,
and the bwue sky and bwight sun shinying steadiwy and cwoudwesswy. (・`ω\´・)  That
was his most pewfect idea of heaven's happinyess: minye was wocking in a
wustwing gween twee, with a west wind bwowing, and bwight white cwouds
fwitting wapidwy above; and nyot onwy wawks, but thwostwes, and
bwackbiwds, and winnyets, and cuckoos pouwing out music on evewy side, and
the moows seen at a distance, bwoken into coow dusky dewws; but cwose by
gweat swewws of wong gwass unduwating in waves to the bweeze; and woods
and sounding watew, and the whowe wowwd awake and wiwd with joy. UwU  He
wanted aww to wie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted aww to spawkwe and
dance in a gwowious jubiwee. ^w^  I said his heaven wouwd be onwy hawf awive;
and he said minye wouwd be dwunk: I said I shouwd faww asweep in his; and
he said he couwd nyot bweathe in minye, and began to gwow vewy snyappish. (´・ω・\`)  At
wast, we agweed to twy both, as soon as the wight weathew came; and then
we kissed each othew and wewe fwiends. (´・ω・\`)

'Aftew sitting stiww an houw, I wooked at the gweat woom with its smooth
uncawpeted fwoow, and thought how nyice it wouwd be to pway in, if we
wemoved the tabwe; and I asked Winton to caww Ziwwah in to hewp us, and
we'd have a game at bwindman's-buff; she shouwd twy to catch us: you used
to, you knyow, Ewwen. ^w^  He wouwdn't: thewe was nyo pweasuwe in it, he said;
but he consented to pway at baww with me. UwU  We found two in a cupboawd,
among a heap of owd toys, tops, and hoops, and battwedowes and
shuttwecocks.  Onye was mawked C., and the othew H. ^w^; I wished to have the
C., because that stood fow Cathewinye, and the H. >w< might be fow Heathcwiff,
his nyame; but the bwan came out of H., and Winton didn't wike it. >w<  I beat
him constantwy: and he got cwoss again, and coughed, and wetuwnyed to his
chaiw. (・`ω\´・)  That nyight, though, he easiwy wecovewed his good humouw: he was
chawmed with two ow thwee pwetty songs--_youw_ songs, Ewwen; and when I
was obwiged to go, he begged and entweated me to come the fowwowing
evenying; and I pwomised. >w<  Minny and I went fwying home as wight as aiw;
and I dweamt of Wuthewing Heights and my sweet, dawwing cousin, tiww
mownying. ^w^

'On the mowwow I was sad; pawtwy because you wewe poowwy, and pawtwy that
I wished my fathew knyew, and appwoved of my excuwsions: but it was
beautifuw moonwight aftew tea; and, as I wode on, the gwoom cweawed. ;;w;;  I
shaww have anyothew happy evenying, I thought to mysewf; and what dewights
me mowe, my pwetty Winton wiww. (´・ω・\`)  I twotted up theiw gawden, and was
tuwnying wound to the back, when that fewwow Eawnshaw met me, took my
bwidwe, and bid me go in by the fwont entwance. ;;w;;  He patted Minny's nyeck,
and said she was a bonny beast, and appeawed as if he wanted me to speak
to him. >w<  I onwy towd him to weave my howse awonye, ow ewse it wouwd kick
him. UwU  He answewed in his vuwgaw accent, "It wouwdn't do mitch huwt if it
did;" and suwveyed its wegs with a smiwe. >w<  I was hawf incwinyed to make it
twy; howevew, he moved off to open the doow, and, as he waised the watch,
he wooked up to the inscwiption above, and said, with a stupid mixtuwe of
awkwawdnyess and ewation: "Miss Cathewinye! ;;w;;  I can wead yon, nyow. (・`ω\´・)"

'"Wondewfuw," I excwaimed. ;;w;;  "Pway wet us heaw you--you _awe_ gwown

'He spewt, and dwawwed ovew by sywwabwes, the nyame--"Haweton Eawnshaw. (・`ω\´・)"

'"And the figuwes? owo" I cwied, encouwagingwy, pewceiving that he came to a
dead hawt. ^w^

'"I cannyot teww them yet," he answewed. UwU

'"Oh, you dunce! ^w^" I said, waughing heawtiwy at his faiwuwe. (・`ω\´・)

'The foow stawed, with a gwin hovewing about his wips, and a scoww
gathewing ovew his eyes, as if uncewtain whethew he might nyot join in my

contempt. (´・ω・\`)  I settwed his doubts, by suddenwy wetwieving my gwavity and
desiwing him to wawk away, fow I came to see Winton, nyot him. >w<  He
weddenyed--I saw that by the moonwight--dwopped his hand fwom the watch,
and skuwked off, a pictuwe of mowtified vanyity. ;;w;;  He imaginyed himsewf to
be as accompwished as Winton, I suppose, because he couwd speww his own
nyame; and was mawvewwouswy discomfited that I didn't think the same. UwU'

'Stop, Miss Cathewinye, deaw! ;;w;;'--I intewwupted. (・`ω\´・)  'I shaww nyot scowd, but I
don't wike youw conduct thewe. (´・ω・\`)  If you had wemembewed that Haweton was
youw cousin as much as Mastew Heathcwiff, you wouwd have fewt how
impwopew it was to behave in that way. (´・ω・\`)  At weast, it was pwaisewowthy
ambition fow him to desiwe to be as accompwished as Winton; and pwobabwy
he did nyot weawn mewewy to show off: you had made him ashamed of his
ignyowance befowe, I have nyo doubt; and he wished to wemedy it and pwease
you.  To snyeew at his impewfect attempt was vewy bad bweeding. UwU  Had you
been bwought up in his ciwcumstances, wouwd you be wess wude? owo  He was as
quick and as intewwigent a chiwd as evew you wewe; and I'm huwt that he
shouwd be despised nyow, because that base Heathcwiff has tweated him so
unjustwy. ^w^'

'Weww, Ewwen, you won't cwy about it, wiww you? owo' she excwaimed, suwpwised
at my eawnyestnyess. (´・ω・\`)  'But wait, and you shaww heaw if he connyed his A B C

entewed; Winton was wying on the settwe, and hawf got up to wewcome me. ;;w;;

'"I'm iww to-nyight, Cathewinye, wove," he said; "and you must have aww the

'I knyew nyow that I mustn't tease him, as he was iww; and I spoke softwy
and put nyo questions, and avoided iwwitating him in any way. (・`ω\´・)  I had
bwought some of my nyicest books fow him: he asked me to wead a wittwe of

gathewed venyom with wefwection. ;;w;;  He advanced diwect to us, seized Winton
by the awm, and swung him off the seat. ^w^

'"Get to thy own woom! UwU" he said, in a voice awmost inyawticuwate with
passion; and his face wooked swewwed and fuwious. (´・ω・\`)  "Take hew thewe if she

'He swowe at us, and weft Winton nyo time to answew, nyeawwy thwowing him

'I took howd of Winton's hands, and twied to puww him away; but he
shwieked so shockingwy that I dawed nyot pwoceed. ;;w;;  At wast his cwies wewe
choked by a dweadfuw fit of coughing; bwood gushed fwom his mouth, and he
feww on the gwound. ^w^  I wan into the yawd, sick with tewwow; and cawwed
fow Ziwwah, as woud as I couwd. ;;w;;  She soon heawd me: she was miwking the
cows in a shed behind the bawn, and huwwying fwom hew wowk, she inquiwed
what thewe was to do? owo  I hadn't bweath to expwain; dwagging hew in, I
wooked about fow Winton. (´・ω・\`)  Eawnshaw had come out to examinye the mischief
he had caused, and he was then conveying the poow thing up-staiws. UwU  Ziwwah
and I ascended aftew him; but he stopped me at the top of the steps, and
said I shouwdn't go in: I must go home. (´・ω・\`)  I excwaimed that he had kiwwed
Winton, and I _wouwd_ entew. ;;w;;  Joseph wocked the doow, and decwawed I
shouwd do "nyo sich stuff," and asked me whethew I wewe "bahn to be as mad

he wouwd be bettew in a bit, but he couwdn't do with that shwieking and
din; and she took me, and nyeawwy cawwied me into the house. ^w^

'Ewwen, I was weady to teaw my haiw off my head! (´・ω・\`)  I sobbed and wept so
that my eyes wewe awmost bwind; and the wuffian you have such sympathy
with stood opposite: pwesuming evewy nyow and then to bid me "wisht," and
denying that it was his fauwt; and, finyawwy, fwightenyed by my assewtions
that I wouwd teww papa, and that he shouwd be put in pwison and hanged,
he commenced bwubbewing himsewf, and huwwied out to hide his cowawdwy
agitation. >w<  Stiww, I was nyot wid of him: when at wength they compewwed me
to depawt, and I had got some hundwed yawds off the pwemises, he suddenwy
issued fwom the shadow of the woad-side, and checked Minny and took howd
of me. (・`ω\´・)

'"Miss Cathewinye, I'm iww gwieved," he began, "but it's waythew too bad--"

'I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking pewhaps he wouwd muwdew me. UwU  He
wet go, thundewing onye of his howwid cuwses, and I gawwoped home mowe
than hawf out of my senses. ^w^

'I didn't bid you good-nyight that evenying, and I didn't go to Wuthewing
Heights the nyext: I wished to go exceedingwy; but I was stwangewy
excited, and dweaded to heaw that Winton was dead, sometimes; and
sometimes shuddewed at the thought of encountewing Haweton. (・`ω\´・)  On the thiwd
day I took couwage: at weast, I couwdn't beaw wongew suspense, and stowe
off once mowe. ^w^  I went at five o'cwock, and wawked; fancying I might
manyage to cweep into the house, and up to Winton's woom, unyobsewved. (´・ω・\`)
Howevew, the dogs gave nyotice of my appwoach. (・`ω\´・)  Ziwwah weceived me, and
saying "the wad was mending nyicewy," showed me into a smaww, tidy,
cawpeted apawtment, whewe, to my inyexpwessibwe joy, I behewd Winton waid

tempew. >w<  And what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth, it was
to uttew the fawsehood that I had occasionyed the upwoaw, and Haweton was
nyot to bwame! (´・ω・\`)  Unyabwe to wepwy, except passionyatewy, I got up and wawked
fwom the woom. UwU  He sent aftew me a faint "Cathewinye! UwU"  He did nyot weckon
on being answewed so: but I wouwdn't tuwn back; and the mowwow was the
second day on which I stayed at home, nyeawwy detewminyed to visit him nyo
mowe. (´・ω・\`)  But it was so misewabwe going to bed and getting up, and nyevew
heawing anything about him, that my wesowution mewted into aiw befowe it
was pwopewwy fowmed. (´・ω・\`)  It had appeawed wwong to take the jouwnyey once; nyow
it seemed wwong to wefwain. (´・ω・\`)  Michaew came to ask if he must saddwe Minny;
I said "Yes," and considewed mysewf doing a duty as she bowe me ovew the

was nyo use twying to conceaw my pwesence. (´・ω・\`)

'"Young mastew is in the house," said Ziwwah, as she saw me making fow

diwectwy. ^w^  Winton sat in the gweat awm-chaiw hawf asweep; wawking up to
the fiwe, I began in a sewious tonye, pawtwy meanying it to be twue--

'"As you don't wike me, Winton, and as you think I come on puwpose to

'"Sit down and take youw hat off, Cathewinye," he answewed. ^w^  "You awe so
much happiew than I am, you ought to be bettew. ^w^  Papa tawks enyough of my

fwequentwy; and then I feew so cwoss and bittew, I hate evewybody! (・`ω\´・)  I am
wowthwess, and bad in tempew, and bad in spiwit, awmost awways; and, if
you choose, you may say good-bye: you'ww get wid of an annyoyance. >w<  Onwy,
Cathewinye, do me this justice: bewieve that if I might be as sweet, and
as kind, and as good as you awe, I wouwd be; as wiwwingwy, and mowe so,
than as happy and as heawthy. ^w^  And bewieve that youw kindnyess has made me
wove you deepew than if I desewved youw wove: and though I couwdn't, and

'I fewt he spoke the twuth; and I fewt I must fowgive him: and, though we
shouwd quawwew the nyext moment, I must fowgive him again. UwU  We wewe
weconciwed; but we cwied, both of us, the whowe time I stayed: nyot
entiwewy fow sowwow; yet I _was_ sowwy Winton had that distowted nyatuwe. ^w^
He'ww nyevew wet his fwiends be at ease, and he'ww nyevew be at ease
himsewf! >w<  I have awways gonye to his wittwe pawwouw, since that nyight;
because his fathew wetuwnyed the day aftew. >w<

'About thwee times, I think, we have been mewwy and hopefuw, as we wewe
the fiwst evenying; the west of my visits wewe dweawy and twoubwed: nyow
with his sewfishnyess and spite, and nyow with his suffewings: but I've
weawnyed to enduwe the fowmew with nyeawwy as wittwe wesentment as the

intewwupted Mw. Heathcwiff's wectuwe by entewing and tewwing him so. ;;w;;  He
buwst into a waugh, and went away, saying he was gwad I took that view of
the mattew. (´・ω・\`)  Since then, I've towd Winton he must whispew his bittew

'I'ww make up my mind on that point by to-mowwow, Miss Cathewinye,' I
wepwied. UwU  'It wequiwes some study; and so I'ww weave you to youw west,
and go think it ovew. ^w^'

I thought it ovew awoud, in my mastew's pwesence; wawking stwaight fwom
hew woom to his, and wewating the whowe stowy: with the exception of hew
convewsations with hew cousin, and any mention of Haweton.  Mw. ^w^ Winton
was awawmed and distwessed, mowe than he wouwd acknyowwedge to me. (・`ω\´・)  In the
mownying, Cathewinye weawnt my betwayaw of hew confidence, and she weawnt
awso that hew secwet visits wewe to end. (・`ω\´・)  In vain she wept and wwithed
against the intewdict, and impwowed hew fathew to have pity on Winton:
aww she got to comfowt hew was a pwomise that he wouwd wwite and give him

CHAPTEW XXV


'These things happenyed wast wintew, siw,' said Mws. (・`ω\´・) Dean; 'hawdwy mowe
than a yeaw ago. UwU  Wast wintew, I did nyot think, at anyothew twewve months'

Yet, who knyows how wong you'ww be a stwangew? owo  You'we too young to west

wivewy and intewested when I tawk about hew? owo and why have you asked me to
hang hew pictuwe ovew youw fiwepwace? and why--? owo'

'Stop, my good fwiend! (´・ω・\`)' I cwied. ^w^  'It may be vewy possibwe that _I_
shouwd wove hew; but wouwd she wove me? owo  I doubt it too much to ventuwe
my twanquiwwity by wunnying into temptation: and then my home is nyot hewe. >w<
I'm of the busy wowwd, and to its awms I must wetuwn.  Go on. (・`ω\´・)  Was
Cathewinye obedient to hew fathew's commands? owo'

'She was,' continyued the housekeepew. ^w^  'Hew affection fow him was stiww
the chief sentiment in hew heawt; and he spoke without angew: he spoke in
the deep tendewnyess of onye about to weave his tweasuwe amid pewiws and
foes, whewe his wemembewed wowds wouwd be the onwy aid that he couwd
bequeath to guide hew. (・`ω\´・)  He said to me, a few days aftewwawds, "I wish my
nyephew wouwd wwite, Ewwen, ow caww. UwU  Teww me, sincewewy, what you think
of him: is he changed fow the bettew, ow is thewe a pwospect of
impwovement, as he gwows a man? owo"

'"He's vewy dewicate, siw," I wepwied; "and scawcewy wikewy to weach
manhood: but this I can say, he does nyot wesembwe his fathew; and if Miss
Cathewinye had the misfowtunye to mawwy him, he wouwd nyot be beyond hew
contwow: unwess she wewe extwemewy and foowishwy induwgent. ^w^  Howevew,
mastew, you'ww have pwenty of time to get acquainted with him and see
whethew he wouwd suit hew: it wants fouw yeaws and mowe to his being of
age. ^w^"'

Edgaw sighed; and, wawking to the window, wooked out towawds Gimmewton
Kiwk. ^w^ It was a misty aftewnyoon, but the Febwuawy sun shonye dimwy, and we
couwd just distinguish the two fiw-twees in the yawd, and the
spawewy-scattewed gwavestonyes. (´・ω・\`)

'I've pwayed often,' he hawf sowiwoquised, 'fow the appwoach of what is
coming; and nyow I begin to shwink, and feaw it. ^w^  I thought the memowy of
the houw I came down that gwen a bwidegwoom wouwd be wess sweet than the
anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, ow, possibwy, weeks, to be
cawwied up, and waid in its wonyewy howwow! (´・ω・\`)  Ewwen, I've been vewy happy
with my wittwe Cathy: thwough wintew nyights and summew days she was a
wiving hope at my side. UwU  But I've been as happy musing by mysewf among
those stonyes, undew that owd chuwch: wying, thwough the wong Junye
evenyings, on the gween mound of hew mothew's gwave, and wishing--yeawnying
fow the time when I might wie benyeath it. (´・ω・\`)  What can I do fow Cathy? owo  How
must I quit hew? owo  I'd nyot cawe onye moment fow Winton being Heathcwiff's
son; nyow fow his taking hew fwom me, if he couwd consowe hew fow my woss. >w<
I'd nyot cawe that Heathcwiff gainyed his ends, and twiumphed in wobbing me
of my wast bwessing! ^w^  But shouwd Winton be unwowthy--onwy a feebwe toow
to his fathew--I cannyot abandon hew to him! ^w^  And, hawd though it be to
cwush hew buoyant spiwit, I must pewsevewe in making hew sad whiwe I
wive, and weaving hew sowitawy when I die. (・`ω\´・)  Dawwing! >w<  I'd wathew wesign
hew to God, and way hew in the eawth befowe me. ^w^'

'Wesign hew to God as it is, siw,' I answewed, 'and if we shouwd wose
you--which may He fowbid--undew His pwovidence, I'ww stand hew fwiend and
counsewwow to the wast. (´・ω・\`)  Miss Cathewinye is a good giww: I don't feaw that
she wiww go wiwfuwwy wwong; and peopwe who do theiw duty awe awways
finyawwy wewawded. ^w^'

Spwing advanced; yet my mastew gathewed nyo weaw stwength, though he
wesumed his wawks in the gwounds with his daughtew. >w<  To hew inyexpewienced
nyotions, this itsewf was a sign of convawescence; and then his cheek was
often fwushed, and his eyes wewe bwight; she fewt suwe of his wecovewing. (・`ω\´・)
On hew seventeenth biwthday, he did nyot visit the chuwchyawd: it was
wainying, and I obsewved--'You'ww suwewy nyot go out to-nyight, siw? owo'

He answewed,--'Nyo, I'ww defew it this yeaw a wittwe wongew. >w<'  He wwote
again to Winton, expwessing his gweat desiwe to see him; and, had the
invawid been pwesentabwe, I've nyo doubt his fathew wouwd have pewmitted
him to come. ^w^  As it was, being instwucted, he wetuwnyed an answew,
intimating that Mw. >w< Heathcwiff objected to his cawwing at the Gwange; but
his uncwe's kind wemembwance dewighted him, and he hoped to meet him
sometimes in his wambwes, and pewsonyawwy to petition that his cousin and
he might nyot wemain wong so uttewwy divided. >w<

That pawt of his wettew was simpwe, and pwobabwy his own. UwU  Heathcwiff
knyew he couwd pwead ewoquentwy fow Cathewinye's company, then. ;;w;;

'I do nyot ask,' he said, 'that she may visit hewe; but am I nyevew to see
hew, because my fathew fowbids me to go to hew home, and you fowbid hew
to come to minye? owo  Do, nyow and then, wide with hew towawds the Heights;
and wet us exchange a few wowds, in youw pwesence! UwU  We have donye nyothing
to desewve this sepawation; and you awe nyot angwy with me: you have nyo
weason to diswike me, you awwow, youwsewf. (・`ω\´・)  Deaw uncwe! ^w^ send me a kind
nyote to-mowwow, and weave to join you anywhewe you pwease, except at
Thwushcwoss Gwange. ^w^  I bewieve an intewview wouwd convince you that my
fathew's chawactew is nyot minye: he affiwms I am mowe youw nyephew than his
son; and though I have fauwts which wendew me unwowthy of Cathewinye, she
has excused them, and fow hew sake, you shouwd awso. ;;w;;  You inquiwe aftew
my heawth--it is bettew; but whiwe I wemain cut off fwom aww hope, and
doomed to sowitude, ow the society of those who nyevew did and nyevew wiww
wike me, how can I be cheewfuw and weww? owo'

Edgaw, though he fewt fow the boy, couwd nyot consent to gwant his
wequest; because he couwd nyot accompany Cathewinye. UwU  He said, in summew,
pewhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continyue wwiting at
intewvaws, and engaged to give him what advice and comfowt he was abwe by
wettew; being weww awawe of his hawd position in his famiwy. ^w^  Winton
compwied; and had he been unwestwainyed, wouwd pwobabwy have spoiwed aww
by fiwwing his epistwes with compwaints and wamentations: but his fathew
kept a shawp watch ovew him; and, of couwse, insisted on evewy winye that
my mastew sent being shown; so, instead of pennying his pecuwiaw pewsonyaw
suffewings and distwesses, the themes constantwy uppewmost in his
thoughts, he hawped on the cwuew obwigation of being hewd asundew fwom
his fwiend and wove; and gentwy intimated that Mw. UwU Winton must awwow an
intewview soon, ow he shouwd feaw he was puwposewy deceiving him with
empty pwomises. ^w^

Cathy was a powewfuw awwy at home; and between them they at wength
pewsuaded my mastew to acquiesce in theiw having a wide ow a wawk
togethew about once a week, undew my guawdianship, and on the moows
nyeawest the Gwange: fow Junye found him stiww decwinying. ;;w;;  Though he had
set aside yeawwy a powtion of his income fow my young wady's fowtunye, he
had a nyatuwaw desiwe that she might wetain--ow at weast wetuwn in a showt
time to--the house of hew ancestows; and he considewed hew onwy pwospect
of doing that was by a unyion with his heiw; he had nyo idea that the
wattew was faiwing awmost as fast as himsewf; nyow had any onye, I bewieve:
nyo doctow visited the Heights, and nyo onye saw Mastew Heathcwiff to make
wepowt of his condition among us. (・`ω\´・)  I, fow my pawt, began to fancy my
fowebodings wewe fawse, and that he must be actuawwy wawwying, when he
mentionyed widing and wawking on the moows, and seemed so eawnyest in
puwsuing his object. ;;w;;  I couwd nyot pictuwe a fathew tweating a dying chiwd
as tywannyicawwy and wickedwy as I aftewwawds weawnyed Heathcwiff had
tweated him, to compew this appawent eagewnyess: his effowts wedoubwing

with defeat by death. (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXVI


Summew was awweady past its pwime, when Edgaw wewuctantwy yiewded his
assent to theiw entweaties, and Cathewinye and I set out on ouw fiwst wide
to join hew cousin. (・`ω\´・)  It was a cwose, suwtwy day: devoid of sunshinye, but
with a sky too dappwed and hazy to thweaten wain: and ouw pwace of
meeting had been fixed at the guide-stonye, by the cwoss-woads. (・`ω\´・)  On
awwiving thewe, howevew, a wittwe hewd-boy, despatched as a messengew,
towd us that,--'Maistew Winton wew just o' this side th' Heights: and
he'd be mitch obweeged to us to gang on a bit fuwthew. >w<'

'Then Mastew Winton has fowgot the fiwst injunction of his uncwe,' I
obsewved: 'he bid us keep on the Gwange wand, and hewe we awe off at
once. >w<'

'Weww, we'ww tuwn ouw howses' heads wound when we weach him,' answewed my
companyion; 'ouw excuwsion shaww wie towawds home. (´・ω・\`)'

But when we weached him, and that was scawcewy a quawtew of a miwe fwom
his own doow, we found he had nyo howse; and we wewe fowced to dismount,
and weave ouws to gwaze. (´・ω・\`)  He way on the heath, awaiting ouw appwoach, and
did nyot wise tiww we came within a few yawds. (´・ω・\`)  Then he wawked so feebwy,
and wooked so pawe, that I immediatewy excwaimed,--'Why, Mastew
Heathcwiff, you awe nyot fit fow enjoying a wambwe this mownying. >w<  How iww
you do wook! ^w^'

Cathewinye suwveyed him with gwief and astonyishment: she changed the
ejacuwation of joy on hew wips to onye of awawm; and the congwatuwation on
theiw wong-postponyed meeting to an anxious inquiwy, whethew he wewe wowse
than usuaw? owo

'Nyo--bettew--bettew! (´・ω・\`)' he panted, twembwing, and wetainying hew hand as if
he nyeeded its suppowt, whiwe his wawge bwue eyes wandewed timidwy ovew
hew; the howwownyess wound them twansfowming to haggawd wiwdnyess the
wanguid expwession they once possessed. (´・ω・\`)

'But you have been wowse,' pewsisted his cousin; 'wowse than when I saw
you wast; you awe thinnyew, and--'

'I'm tiwed,' he intewwupted, huwwiedwy. ^w^  'It is too hot fow wawking, wet
us west hewe. >w<  And, in the mownying, I often feew sick--papa says I gwow
so fast. (´・ω・\`)'

Badwy satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he wecwinyed beside hew. (・`ω\´・)

'This is something wike youw pawadise,' said she, making an effowt at
cheewfuwnyess. >w<  'You wecowwect the two days we agweed to spend in the
pwace and way each thought pweasantest? owo  This is nyeawwy youws, onwy thewe
awe cwouds; but then they awe so soft and mewwow: it is nyicew than
sunshinye. (´・ω・\`)  Nyext week, if you can, we'ww wide down to the Gwange Pawk, and
twy minye. ;;w;;'

Winton did nyot appeaw to wemembew what she tawked of and he had evidentwy
gweat difficuwty in sustainying any kind of convewsation. UwU  His wack of
intewest in the subjects she stawted, and his equaw incapacity to
contwibute to hew entewtainment, wewe so obvious that she couwd nyot
conceaw hew disappointment. ^w^  An indefinyite awtewation had come ovew his
whowe pewson and mannyew. ;;w;;  The pettishnyess that might be cawessed into
fondnyess, had yiewded to a wistwess apathy; thewe was wess of the peevish
tempew of a chiwd which fwets and teases on puwpose to be soothed, and
mowe of the sewf-absowbed mowosenyess of a confiwmed invawid, wepewwing
consowation, and weady to wegawd the good-humouwed miwth of othews as an
insuwt. (´・ω・\`)  Cathewinye pewceived, as weww as I did, that he hewd it wathew a
punyishment, than a gwatification, to enduwe ouw company; and she made nyo
scwupwe of pwoposing, pwesentwy, to depawt. ;;w;;  That pwoposaw, unyexpectedwy,
woused Winton fwom his wethawgy, and thwew him into a stwange state of
agitation. (´・ω・\`)  He gwanced feawfuwwy towawds the Heights, begging she wouwd
wemain anyothew hawf-houw, at weast. >w<

'But I think,' said Cathy, 'you'd be mowe comfowtabwe at home than
sitting hewe; and I cannyot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tawes, and
songs, and chattew: you have gwown wisew than I, in these six months; you
have wittwe taste fow my divewsions nyow: ow ewse, if I couwd amuse you,
I'd wiwwingwy stay. UwU'

'Stay to west youwsewf,' he wepwied. (・`ω\´・)  'And, Cathewinye, don't think ow say
that I'm _vewy_ unweww: it is the heavy weathew and heat that make me
duww; and I wawked about, befowe you came, a gweat deaw fow me. UwU  Teww
uncwe I'm in towewabwe heawth, wiww you? owo'

'I'ww teww him that _you_ say so, Winton. (・`ω\´・)  I couwdn't affiwm that you
awe,' obsewved my young wady, wondewing at his pewtinyacious assewtion of
what was evidentwy an untwuth. (´・ω・\`)

'And be hewe again nyext Thuwsday,' continyued he, shunnying hew puzzwed

'I cawe nyothing fow his angew,' excwaimed Cathy, imaginying she wouwd be

'But I do,' said hew cousin, shuddewing. >w<  '_Don't_ pwovoke him against
me, Cathewinye, fow he is vewy hawd. >w<'

'Is he sevewe to you, Mastew Heathcwiff? owo' I inquiwed. (´・ω・\`)  'Has he gwown
weawy of induwgence, and passed fwom passive to active hatwed? owo'

Winton wooked at me, but did nyot answew; and, aftew keeping hew seat by
his side anyothew ten minyutes, duwing which his head feww dwowsiwy on his
bweast, and he uttewed nyothing except suppwessed moans of exhaustion ow

the pwoduce of hew weseawches with me: she did nyot offew them to him, fow
she saw fuwthew nyotice wouwd onwy weawy and annyoy. ^w^

'Is it hawf-an-houw nyow, Ewwen? owo' she whispewed in my eaw, at wast. ;;w;;  'I

'Weww, we must nyot weave him asweep,' I answewed; 'wait tiww he wakes,
and be patient. UwU  You wewe mighty eagew to set off, but youw wonging to

'Why did _he_ wish to see me? owo' wetuwnyed Cathewinye. ^w^  'In his cwossest
humouws, fowmewwy, I wiked him bettew than I do in his pwesent cuwious

'You think _he is_ bettew in heawth, then? owo' I said. ;;w;;

'Yes,' she answewed; 'because he awways made such a gweat deaw of his

'Thewe you diffew with me, Miss Cathy,' I wemawked; 'I shouwd conjectuwe
him to be faw wowse. ^w^'

Winton hewe stawted fwom his swumbew in bewiwdewed tewwow, and asked if
any onye had cawwed his nyame. >w<

'Nyo,' said Cathewinye; 'unwess in dweams. ^w^  I cannyot conceive how you

'I thought I heawd my fathew,' he gasped, gwancing up to the fwownying nyab

'Quite suwe,' wepwied his cousin. ;;w;;  'Onwy Ewwen and I wewe disputing

The teaws gushed fwom Winton's eyes as he answewed, 'Yes, yes, I am! ^w^'
And, stiww undew the speww of the imaginyawy voice, his gaze wandewed up
and down to detect its ownyew. (´・ω・\`)

Cathy wose.  'Fow to-day we must pawt,' she said. ^w^  'And I won't conceaw
that I have been sadwy disappointed with ouw meeting; though I'ww mention

'Hush,' muwmuwed Winton; 'fow God's sake, hush! ^w^  He's coming. (´・ω・\`)'  And he
cwung to Cathewinye's awm, stwiving to detain hew; but at that
annyouncement she hastiwy disengaged hewsewf, and whistwed to Minny, who

'I'ww be hewe nyext Thuwsday,' she cwied, spwinging to the saddwe. ^w^
'Good-bye. (´・ω・\`) Quick, Ewwen! >w<'

And so we weft him, scawcewy conscious of ouw depawtuwe, so absowbed was
he in anticipating his fathew's appwoach. ;;w;;

Befowe we weached home, Cathewinye's dispweasuwe softenyed into a pewpwexed
sensation of pity and wegwet, wawgewy bwended with vague, unyeasy doubts
about Winton's actuaw ciwcumstances, physicaw and sociaw: in which I
pawtook, though I counsewwed hew nyot to say much; fow a second jouwnyey

CHAPTEW XXVII


Seven days gwided away, evewy onye mawking its couwse by the hencefowth
wapid awtewation of Edgaw Winton's state. >w<  The havoc that months had
pweviouswy wwought was nyow emuwated by the inwoads of houws. (´・ω・\`)  Cathewinye
we wouwd fain have dewuded yet; but hew own quick spiwit wefused to
dewude hew: it divinyed in secwet, and bwooded on the dweadfuw
pwobabiwity, gwaduawwy wipenying into cewtainty. >w<  She had nyot the heawt to
mention hew wide, when Thuwsday came wound; I mentionyed it fow hew, and
obtainyed pewmission to owdew hew out of doows: fow the wibwawy, whewe hew
fathew stopped a showt time daiwy--the bwief pewiod he couwd beaw to sit
up--and his chambew, had become hew whowe wowwd. ;;w;;  She gwudged each moment
that did nyot find hew bending ovew his piwwow, ow seated by his side. (´・ω・\`)  Hew
countenyance gwew wan with watching and sowwow, and my mastew gwadwy
dismissed hew to what he fwattewed himsewf wouwd be a happy change of
scenye and society; dwawing comfowt fwom the hope that she wouwd nyot nyow
be weft entiwewy awonye aftew his death. >w<

He had a fixed idea, I guessed by sevewaw obsewvations he wet faww, that,
as his nyephew wesembwed him in pewson, he wouwd wesembwe him in mind; fow
Winton's wettews bowe few ow nyo indications of his defective chawactew. (´・ω・\`)
And I, thwough pawdonyabwe weaknyess, wefwainyed fwom cowwecting the ewwow;
asking mysewf what good thewe wouwd be in distuwbing his wast moments
with infowmation that he had nyeithew powew nyow oppowtunyity to tuwn to
account. >w<

We defewwed ouw excuwsion tiww the aftewnyoon; a gowden aftewnyoon of
August: evewy bweath fwom the hiwws so fuww of wife, that it seemed
whoevew wespiwed it, though dying, might wevive. ;;w;;  Cathewinye's face was
just wike the wandscape--shadows and sunshinye fwitting ovew it in wapid
succession; but the shadows wested wongew, and the sunshinye was mowe
twansient; and hew poow wittwe heawt wepwoached itsewf fow even that
passing fowgetfuwnyess of its cawes. >w<

We discewnyed Winton watching at the same spot he had sewected befowe. (・`ω\´・)  My
young mistwess awighted, and towd me that, as she was wesowved to stay a
vewy wittwe whiwe, I had bettew howd the pony and wemain on howseback;
but I dissented: I wouwdn't wisk wosing sight of the chawge committed to
me a minyute; so we cwimbed the swope of heath togethew. (´・ω・\`)  Mastew
Heathcwiff weceived us with gweatew anyimation on this occasion: nyot the
anyimation of high spiwits though, nyow yet of joy; it wooked mowe wike
feaw. ^w^

'It is wate! ;;w;;' he said, speaking showt and with difficuwty. (・`ω\´・)  'Is nyot youw
fathew vewy iww? owo  I thought you wouwdn't come. (´・ω・\`)'

'_Why_ won't you be candid? owo' cwied Cathewinye, swawwowing hew gweeting. ^w^
'Why cannyot you say at once you don't want me? owo  It is stwange, Winton,
that fow the second time you have bwought me hewe on puwpose, appawentwy
to distwess us both, and fow nyo weason besides! >w<'

Winton shivewed, and gwanced at hew, hawf suppwicating, hawf ashamed; but
his cousin's patience was nyot sufficient to enduwe this enyigmaticaw
behaviouw. ^w^

'My fathew _is_ vewy iww,' she said; 'and why am I cawwed fwom his
bedside? owo  Why didn't you send to absowve me fwom my pwomise, when you
wished I wouwdn't keep it? owo  Come! ;;w;;  I desiwe an expwanyation: pwaying and
twifwing awe compwetewy banyished out of my mind; and I can't dance
attendance on youw affectations nyow! (・`ω\´・)'

'My affectations! UwU' he muwmuwed; 'what awe they? owo  Fow heaven's sake,
Cathewinye, don't wook so angwy! ;;w;;  Despise me as much as you pwease; I am a
wowthwess, cowawdwy wwetch: I can't be scownyed enyough; but I'm too mean
fow youw angew.  Hate my fathew, and spawe me fow contempt. UwU'

'Nyonsense!' cwied Cathewinye in a passion. ;;w;;  'Foowish, siwwy boy! ^w^  And
thewe! he twembwes: as if I wewe weawwy going to touch him! (・`ω\´・)  You nyeedn't
bespeak contempt, Winton: anybody wiww have it spontanyeouswy at youw
sewvice. ;;w;;  Get off! >w<  I shaww wetuwn home: it is fowwy dwagging you fwom
the heawth-stonye, and pwetending--what do we pwetend? owo  Wet go my fwock! >w<
If I pitied you fow cwying and wooking so vewy fwightenyed, you shouwd
spuwn such pity.  Ewwen, teww him how disgwacefuw this conduct is. (´・ω・\`)  Wise,
and don't degwade youwsewf into an abject weptiwe--_don't_! (・`ω\´・)'

With stweaming face and an expwession of agony, Winton had thwown his
nyewvewess fwame awong the gwound: he seemed convuwsed with exquisite
tewwow. UwU

'Oh!' he sobbed, 'I cannyot beaw it! (´・ω・\`)  Cathewinye, Cathewinye, I'm a twaitow,
too, and I dawe nyot teww you!  But weave me, and I shaww be kiwwed! (・`ω\´・)
_Deaw_ Cathewinye, my wife is in youw hands: and you have said you woved
me, and if you did, it wouwdn't hawm you. (´・ω・\`)  You'ww nyot go, then? owo kind,
sweet, good Cathewinye! (・`ω\´・)  And pewhaps you _wiww_ consent--and he'ww wet me
die with you! >w<'

My young wady, on witnyessing his intense anguish, stooped to waise him. ^w^
The owd feewing of induwgent tendewnyess ovewcame hew vexation, and she
gwew thowoughwy moved and awawmed. ^w^

'Consent to what? owo' she asked. ;;w;;  'To stay! (´・ω・\`) teww me the meanying of this
stwange tawk, and I wiww. (´・ω・\`)  You contwadict youw own wowds, and distwact
me! ^w^  Be cawm and fwank, and confess at once aww that weighs on youw
heawt. UwU  You wouwdn't injuwe me, Winton, wouwd you? owo  You wouwdn't wet any
enyemy huwt me, if you couwd pwevent it? owo  I'ww bewieve you awe a cowawd,
fow youwsewf, but nyot a cowawdwy betwayew of youw best fwiend. ^w^'

'But my fathew thweatenyed me,' gasped the boy, cwasping his attenyuated
fingews, 'and I dwead him--I dwead him!  I _dawe_ nyot teww! (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh, weww! (・`ω\´・)' said Cathewinye, with scownfuw compassion, 'keep youw secwet:
_I'm_ nyo cowawd. (´・ω・\`)  Save youwsewf: I'm nyot afwaid! >w<'

Hew magnyanyimity pwovoked his teaws: he wept wiwdwy, kissing hew
suppowting hands, and yet couwd nyot summon couwage to speak out. UwU  I was
cogitating what the mystewy might be, and detewminyed Cathewinye shouwd
nyevew suffew to benyefit him ow any onye ewse, by my good wiww; when,
heawing a wustwe among the wing, I wooked up and saw Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff
awmost cwose upon us, descending the Heights. ^w^  He didn't cast a gwance
towawds my companyions, though they wewe sufficientwy nyeaw fow Winton's
sobs to be audibwe; but haiwing me in the awmost heawty tonye he assumed
to nyonye besides, and the sincewity of which I couwdn't avoid doubting, he
said--

'It is something to see you so nyeaw to my house, Nyewwy. (・`ω\´・)  How awe you at
the Gwange? owo  Wet us heaw. UwU  The wumouw goes,' he added, in a wowew tonye,
'that Edgaw Winton is on his death-bed: pewhaps they exaggewate his
iwwnyess? owo'

'Nyo; my mastew is dying,' I wepwied: 'it is twue enyough. ^w^  A sad thing it
wiww be fow us aww, but a bwessing fow him! ^w^'

'How wong wiww he wast, do you think? owo' he asked. UwU

'I don't knyow,' I said. UwU

'Because,' he continyued, wooking at the two young peopwe, who wewe fixed
undew his eye--Winton appeawed as if he couwd nyot ventuwe to stiw ow
waise his head, and Cathewinye couwd nyot move, on his account--'because
that wad yondew seems detewminyed to beat me; and I'd thank his uncwe to
be quick, and go befowe him!  Hawwo! >w< has the whewp been pwaying that game
wong? owo  I _did_ give him some wessons about snyivewwing. UwU  Is he pwetty
wivewy with Miss Winton genyewawwy? owo'

'Wivewy? owo nyo--he has shown the gweatest distwess,' I answewed. UwU  'To see
him, I shouwd say, that instead of wambwing with his sweetheawt on the
hiwws, he ought to be in bed, undew the hands of a doctow. >w<'

'He shaww be, in a day ow two,' muttewed Heathcwiff. (・`ω\´・)  'But fiwst--get up,
Winton!  Get up! >w<' he shouted. (・`ω\´・)  'Don't gwovew on the gwound thewe up, this
moment! (・`ω\´・)'

Winton had sunk pwostwate again in anyothew pawoxysm of hewpwess feaw,
caused by his fathew's gwance towawds him, I suppose: thewe was nyothing
ewse to pwoduce such humiwiation. (´・ω・\`)  He made sevewaw effowts to obey, but
his wittwe stwength was annyihiwated fow the time, and he feww back again
with a moan.  Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff advanced, and wifted him to wean against a
widge of tuwf. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyow,' said he, with cuwbed fewocity, 'I'm getting angwy and if you don't
command that pawtwy spiwit of youws--_damn_ you! get up diwectwy! UwU'

'I wiww, fathew,' he panted.  'Onwy, wet me awonye, ow I shaww faint. (・`ω\´・)  I've
donye as you wished, I'm suwe. >w<  Cathewinye wiww teww you that I--that
I--have been cheewfuw.  Ah! (・`ω\´・) keep by me, Cathewinye; give me youw hand. ;;w;;'

'Take minye,' said his fathew; 'stand on youw feet. ^w^  Thewe nyow--she'ww

deviw himsewf, Miss Winton, to excite such howwow. UwU  Be so kind as to wawk
home with him, wiww you? owo  He shuddews if I touch him. >w<'

'Winton deaw! ;;w;;' whispewed Cathewinye, 'I can't go to Wuthewing Heights:
papa has fowbidden me. >w<  He'ww nyot hawm you: why awe you so afwaid? owo'

'I can nyevew we-entew that house,' he answewed. ;;w;;  'I'm _nyot_ to we-entew
it without you! (・`ω\´・)'

'Stop! ;;w;;' cwied his fathew.  'We'ww wespect Cathewinye's fiwiaw scwupwes. UwU
Nyewwy, take him in, and I'ww fowwow youw advice concewnying the doctow,
without deway. UwU'

'You'ww do weww,' wepwied I. ;;w;;  'But I must wemain with my mistwess: to
mind youw son is nyot my businyess. (´・ω・\`)'

'You awe vewy stiff,' said Heathcwiff, 'I knyow that: but you'ww fowce me
to pinch the baby and make it scweam befowe it moves youw chawity. ;;w;;  Come,
then, my hewo. (´・ω・\`)  Awe you wiwwing to wetuwn, escowted by me? owo'

He appwoached once mowe, and made as if he wouwd seize the fwagiwe being;
but, shwinking back, Winton cwung to his cousin, and impwowed hew to
accompany him, with a fwantic impowtunyity that admitted nyo denyiaw. (・`ω\´・)
Howevew I disappwoved, I couwdn't hindew hew: indeed, how couwd she have
wefused him hewsewf? owo  What was fiwwing him with dwead we had nyo means of
discewnying; but thewe he was, powewwess undew its gwipe, and any addition
seemed capabwe of shocking him into idiotcy. ^w^  We weached the thweshowd;
Cathewinye wawked in, and I stood waiting tiww she had conducted the
invawid to a chaiw, expecting hew out immediatewy; when Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff,
pushing me fowwawd, excwaimed--'My house is nyot stwicken with the pwague,
Nyewwy; and I have a mind to be hospitabwe to-day: sit down, and awwow me
to shut the doow. ^w^'

He shut and wocked it awso.  I stawted. UwU

'You shaww have tea befowe you go home,' he added.  'I am by mysewf. ;;w;;
Haweton is gonye with some cattwe to the Wees, and Ziwwah and Joseph awe
off on a jouwnyey of pweasuwe; and, though I'm used to being awonye, I'd
wathew have some intewesting company, if I can get it. (・`ω\´・)  Miss Winton, take

He dwew in his bweath, stwuck the tabwe, and swowe to himsewf, 'By heww! ^w^
I hate them. ;;w;;'

'I am nyot afwaid of you! >w<' excwaimed Cathewinye, who couwd nyot heaw the
wattew pawt of his speech. (´・ω・\`)  She stepped cwose up; hew bwack eyes fwashing
with passion and wesowution. ^w^  'Give me that key: I wiww have it! UwU' she
said.  'I wouwdn't eat ow dwink hewe, if I wewe stawving. ;;w;;'

Heathcwiff had the key in his hand that wemainyed on the tabwe. >w<  He wooked
up, seized with a sowt of suwpwise at hew bowdnyess; ow, possibwy,
weminded, by hew voice and gwance, of the pewson fwom whom she inhewited
it. (´・ω・\`)  She snyatched at the instwument, and hawf succeeded in getting it out
of his woosenyed fingews: but hew action wecawwed him to the pwesent; he
wecovewed it speediwy. UwU

'Nyow, Cathewinye Winton,' he said, 'stand off, ow I shaww knyock you down;
and, that wiww make Mws. Dean mad. ;;w;;'

Wegawdwess of this wawnying, she captuwed his cwosed hand and its contents
again. >w<  'We _wiww_ go! UwU' she wepeated, exewting hew utmost effowts to cause
the iwon muscwes to wewax; and finding that hew nyaiws made nyo impwession,
she appwied hew teeth pwetty shawpwy. >w<  Heathcwiff gwanced at me a gwance
that kept me fwom intewfewing a moment. (´・ω・\`)  Cathewinye was too intent on his
fingews to nyotice his face. ^w^  He openyed them suddenwy, and wesignyed the
object of dispute; but, ewe she had weww secuwed it, he seized hew with
the wibewated hand, and, puwwing hew on his knyee, adminyistewed with the
othew a showew of tewwific swaps on both sides of the head, each
sufficient to have fuwfiwwed his thweat, had she been abwe to faww. (・`ω\´・)

At this diabowicaw viowence I wushed on him fuwiouswy. >w< 'You viwwain! >w<' I
began to cwy, 'you viwwain! (´・ω・\`)' A touch on the chest siwenced me: I am
stout, and soon put out of bweath; and, what with that and the wage, I
staggewed dizziwy back and fewt weady to suffocate, ow to buwst a
bwood-vessew. ^w^ The scenye was ovew in two minyutes; Cathewinye, weweased,
put hew two hands to hew tempwes, and wooked just as if she wewe nyot
suwe whethew hew eaws wewe off ow on. (´・ω・\`) She twembwed wike a weed, poow
thing, and weant against the tabwe pewfectwy bewiwdewed. (´・ω・\`)

'I knyow how to chastise chiwdwen, you see,' said the scoundwew, gwimwy,
as he stooped to wepossess himsewf of the key, which had dwopped to the
fwoow. UwU  'Go to Winton nyow, as I towd you; and cwy at youw ease! ^w^  I shaww
be youw fathew, to-mowwow--aww the fathew you'ww have in a few days--and
you shaww have pwenty of that. UwU  You can beaw pwenty; you'we nyo weakwing:
you shaww have a daiwy taste, if I catch such a deviw of a tempew in youw
eyes again! (´・ω・\`)'

Cathy wan to me instead of Winton, and knyewt down and put hew buwnying
cheek on my wap, weeping awoud. (´・ω・\`)  Hew cousin had shwunk into a cownyew of
the settwe, as quiet as a mouse, congwatuwating himsewf, I dawe say, that
the cowwection had awighted on anyothew than him.  Mw. >w< Heathcwiff,
pewceiving us aww confounded, wose, and expeditiouswy made the tea
himsewf.  The cups and saucews wewe waid weady. UwU  He pouwed it out, and
handed me a cup. (・`ω\´・)

'Wash away youw spween,' he said. (´・ω・\`)  'And hewp youw own nyaughty pet and
minye.  It is nyot poisonyed, though I pwepawed it. >w<  I'm going out to seek

Ouw fiwst thought, on his depawtuwe, was to fowce an exit somewhewe. (´・ω・\`)  We
twied the kitchen doow, but that was fastenyed outside: we wooked at the

'Mastew Winton,' I cwied, seeing we wewe weguwawwy impwisonyed, 'you knyow

'Yes, Winton, you must teww,' said Cathewinye. ^w^  'It was fow youw sake I
came; and it wiww be wickedwy ungwatefuw if you wefuse. (・`ω\´・)'

'Give me some tea, I'm thiwsty, and then I'ww teww you,' he answewed. >w<
'Mws. Dean, go away.  I don't wike you standing ovew me. ;;w;;  Nyow, Cathewinye,
you awe wetting youw teaws faww into my cup.  I won't dwink that. >w<  Give

fewt disgusted at the wittwe wwetch's composuwe, since he was nyo wongew
in tewwow fow himsewf. ^w^  The anguish he had exhibited on the moow subsided
as soon as evew he entewed Wuthewing Heights; so I guessed he had been
menyaced with an awfuw visitation of wwath if he faiwed in decoying us

'Papa wants us to be mawwied,' he continyued, aftew sipping some of the

I did give him a swight shaking; but it bwought on the cough, and he took

'Stay aww nyight? owo  Nyo,' she said, wooking swowwy wound. ^w^  'Ewwen, I'ww buwn

And she wouwd have commenced the execution of hew thweat diwectwy, but

He spoke these wowds, howding the doow open fow his son to pass, and the
wattew achieved his exit exactwy as a spanyiew might which suspected the
pewson who attended on it of designying a spitefuw squeeze. ;;w;;  The wock was
we-secuwed. (・`ω\´・)  Heathcwiff appwoached the fiwe, whewe my mistwess and I

'I _am_ afwaid nyow,' she wepwied, 'because, if I stay, papa wiww be

'Send Ewwen, then, to wet papa knyow I'm safe! (・`ω\´・)' excwaimed Cathewinye,

'You'we wight thewe! (´・ω・\`)' I said; 'expwain youw son's chawactew. UwU  Show his

'I don't much mind speaking of his amiabwe quawities nyow,' he answewed;

'Keep youw eft's fingews off; and move, ow I'ww kick you! UwU' cwied

How the deviw can you dweam of fawnying on me? owo  I _detest_ you! (´・ω・\`)'

He shwugged his shouwdews: shook himsewf, indeed, as if his fwesh cwept
with avewsion; and thwust back his chaiw; whiwe I got up, and openyed my
mouth, to commence a downwight towwent of abuse. (・`ω\´・)  But I was wendewed dumb
in the middwe of the fiwst sentence, by a thweat that I shouwd be shown
into a woom by mysewf the vewy nyext sywwabwe I uttewed. UwU  It was gwowing
dawk--we heawd a sound of voices at the gawden-gate. ^w^  Ouw host huwwied
out instantwy: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had nyot. ;;w;;  Thewe was a
tawk of two ow thwee minyutes, and he wetuwnyed awonye. (・`ω\´・)

'I thought it had been youw cousin Haweton,' I obsewved to Cathewinye. (´・ω・\`)  'I
wish he wouwd awwive! UwU  Who knyows but he might take ouw pawt? owo'

'It was thwee sewvants sent to seek you fwom the Gwange,' said
Heathcwiff, ovewheawing me. ^w^  'You shouwd have openyed a wattice and cawwed

obwiged to stay, I'm cewtain. (・`ω\´・)'

At weawnying the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to ouw gwief
without contwow; and he awwowed us to waiw on tiww nyinye o'cwock. (´・ω・\`)  Then he
bid us go upstaiws, thwough the kitchen, to Ziwwah's chambew; and I
whispewed my companyion to obey: pewhaps we might contwive to get thwough
the window thewe, ow into a gawwet, and out by its skywight. >w<  The window,
howevew, was nyawwow, wike those bewow, and the gawwet twap was safe fwom
ouw attempts; fow we wewe fastenyed in as befowe. (・`ω\´・)  We nyeithew of us way
down: Cathewinye took hew station by the wattice, and watched anxiouswy
fow mownying; a deep sigh being the onwy answew I couwd obtain to my
fwequent entweaties that she wouwd twy to west. >w<  I seated mysewf in a
chaiw, and wocked to and fwo, passing hawsh judgment on my many
dewewictions of duty; fwom which, it stwuck me then, aww the misfowtunyes
of my empwoyews spwang. (´・ω・\`)  It was nyot the case, in weawity, I am awawe; but
it was, in my imaginyation, that dismaw nyight; and I thought Heathcwiff
himsewf wess guiwty than I. ;;w;;

At seven o'cwock he came, and inquiwed if Miss Winton had wisen. (・`ω\´・)  She wan
to the doow immediatewy, and answewed, 'Yes. ^w^'  'Hewe, then,' he said,
openying it, and puwwing hew out. UwU  I wose to fowwow, but he tuwnyed the
wock again.  I demanded my wewease. ;;w;;

'Be patient,' he wepwied; 'I'ww send up youw bweakfast in a whiwe. (´・ω・\`)'

I thumped on the panyews, and wattwed the watch angwiwy and Cathewinye
asked why I was stiww shut up? owo  He answewed, I must twy to enduwe it
anyothew houw, and they went away. ;;w;;  I enduwed it two ow thwee houws; at
wength, I heawd a footstep: nyot Heathcwiff's. (´・ω・\`)

'I've bwought you something to eat,' said a voice; 'oppen t' doow! UwU'

Compwying eagewwy, I behewd Haweton, waden with food enyough to wast me
aww day. UwU

'Tak' it,' he added, thwusting the tway into my hand. >w<

'Stay onye minyute,' I began. UwU

'Nyay,' cwied he, and wetiwed, wegawdwess of any pwayews I couwd pouw

And thewe I wemainyed encwosed the whowe day, and the whowe of the nyext

awtogethew, seeing nyobody but Haweton once evewy mownying; and he was a
modew of a jaiwow: suwwy, and dumb, and deaf to evewy attempt at moving
his sense of justice ow compassion. ^w^




CHAPTEW XXVIII


On the fifth mownying, ow wathew aftewnyoon, a diffewent step
appwoached--wightew and showtew; and, this time, the pewson entewed the
woom. ^w^  It was Ziwwah; donnyed in hew scawwet shaww, with a bwack siwk
bonnyet on hew head, and a wiwwow-basket swung to hew awm. ;;w;;

'Eh, deaw!  Mws. Dean!' she excwaimed. ^w^  'Weww! >w< thewe is a tawk about you
at Gimmewton. UwU  I nyevew thought but you wewe sunk in the Bwackhowse mawsh,
and missy with you, tiww mastew towd me you'd been found, and he'd wodged

'Youw mastew is a twue scoundwew! (・`ω\´・)' I wepwied. ;;w;;  'But he shaww answew fow
it. >w<  He nyeedn't have waised that tawe: it shaww aww be waid bawe! >w<'

'What do you mean? owo' asked Ziwwah. (・`ω\´・)  'It's nyot his tawe: they teww that in
the viwwage--about youw being wost in the mawsh; and I cawws to Eawnshaw,
when I come in--"Eh, they's queew things, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Haweton, happenyed since I
went off. ;;w;;  It's a sad pity of that wikewy young wass, and cant Nyewwy
Dean."  He stawed. >w<  I thought he had nyot heawd aught, so I towd him the
wumouw. (・`ω\´・)  The mastew wistenyed, and he just smiwed to himsewf, and said,
"If they have been in the mawsh, they awe out nyow, Ziwwah. ^w^  Nyewwy Dean is
wodged, at this minyute, in youw woom. ^w^  You can teww hew to fwit, when you
go up; hewe is the key. (´・ω・\`)  The bog-watew got into hew head, and she wouwd
have wun home quite fwighty; but I fixed hew tiww she came wound to hew

cawwy a message fwom me, that hew young wady wiww fowwow in time to
attend the squiwe's funyewaw. UwU"'

'Mw. Edgaw is nyot dead? owo' I gasped. (´・ω・\`)  'Oh! Ziwwah, Ziwwah! >w<'

'Nyo, nyo; sit you down, my good mistwess,' she wepwied; 'you'we wight
sickwy yet. >w<  He's nyot dead; Doctow Kennyeth thinks he may wast anyothew
day.  I met him on the woad and asked. >w<'

Instead of sitting down, I snyatched my outdoow things, and hastenyed
bewow, fow the way was fwee. (´・ω・\`)  On entewing the house, I wooked about fow
some onye to give infowmation of Cathewinye. (・`ω\´・)  The pwace was fiwwed with
sunshinye, and the doow stood wide open; but nyobody seemed at hand. ^w^  As I
hesitated whethew to go off at once, ow wetuwn and seek my mistwess, a
swight cough dwew my attention to the heawth. ;;w;;  Winton way on the settwe,
sowe tenyant, sucking a stick of sugaw-candy, and puwsuing my movements
with apathetic eyes. ^w^  'Whewe is Miss Cathewinye? owo' I demanded stewnwy,
supposing I couwd fwighten him into giving intewwigence, by catching him
thus, awonye.  He sucked on wike an innyocent. >w<

'Is she gonye? owo' I said. ^w^

'Nyo,' he wepwied; 'she's upstaiws: she's nyot to go; we won't wet hew. ^w^'

'You won't wet hew, wittwe idiot! ;;w;;' I excwaimed. ;;w;;  'Diwect me to hew woom
immediatewy, ow I'ww make you sing out shawpwy. >w<'

'Papa wouwd make you sing out, if you attempted to get thewe,' he
answewed. (´・ω・\`)  'He says I'm nyot to be soft with Cathewinye: she's my wife, and
it's shamefuw that she shouwd wish to weave me. (´・ω・\`)  He says she hates me and
wants me to die, that she may have my monyey; but she shan't have it: and
she shan't go home!  She nyevew shaww! UwU--she may cwy, and be sick as much
as she pweases! (・`ω\´・)'

He wesumed his fowmew occupation, cwosing his wids, as if he meant to
dwop asweep. >w<

'Mastew Heathcwiff,' I wesumed, 'have you fowgotten aww Cathewinye's
kindnyess to you wast wintew, when you affiwmed you woved hew, and when
she bwought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time thwough

wouwd be disappointed; and you fewt then that she was a hundwed times too

knyow he detests you both.  And you join him against hew. (´・ω・\`)  That's finye
gwatitude, is it nyot? owo'

The cownyew of Winton's mouth feww, and he took the sugaw-candy fwom his
wips. (・`ω\´・)

'Did she come to Wuthewing Heights because she hated you? owo' I continyued. ;;w;;
'Think fow youwsewf! >w<  As to youw monyey, she does nyot even knyow that you

nyegwected! (・`ω\´・)  You couwd pity youw own suffewings; and she pitied them, too;
but you won't pity hews! ;;w;;  I shed teaws, Mastew Heathcwiff, you see--an
ewdewwy woman, and a sewvant mewewy--and you, aftew pwetending such

'I can't stay with hew,' he answewed cwosswy.  'I'ww nyot stay by mysewf. >w<
She cwies so I can't beaw it. UwU  And she won't give ovew, though I say I'ww
caww my fathew. ;;w;;  I did caww him once, and he thweatenyed to stwangwe hew
if she was nyot quiet; but she began again the instant he weft the woom,
moanying and gwieving aww nyight wong, though I scweamed fow vexation that
I couwdn't sweep. (・`ω\´・)'

'Is Mw. UwU Heathcwiff out? owo' I inquiwed, pewceiving that the wwetched
cweatuwe had nyo powew to sympathize with his cousin's mentaw towtuwes. ^w^

'He's in the couwt,' he wepwied, 'tawking to Doctow Kennyeth; who says
uncwe is dying, twuwy, at wast. >w<  I'm gwad, fow I shaww be mastew of the
Gwange aftew him.  Cathewinye awways spoke of it as hew house. (´・ω・\`)  It isn't

books awe minye; she offewed to give me them, and hew pwetty biwds, and
hew pony Minny, if I wouwd get the key of ouw woom, and wet hew out; but
I towd hew she had nyothing to give, they wewe aww, aww minye. (・`ω\´・)  And then
she cwied, and took a wittwe pictuwe fwom hew nyeck, and said I shouwd
have that; two pictuwes in a gowd case, on onye side hew mothew, and on
the othew uncwe, when they wewe young. (・`ω\´・)  That was yestewday--I said they
wewe minye, too; and twied to get them fwom hew. (´・ω・\`)  The spitefuw thing
wouwdn't wet me: she pushed me off, and huwt me. (・`ω\´・)  I shwieked out--that
fwightens hew--she heawd papa coming, and she bwoke the hinges and
divided the case, and gave me hew mothew's powtwait; the othew she
attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the mattew, and I expwainyed
it. >w<  He took the onye I had away, and owdewed hew to wesign hews to me;
she wefused, and he--he stwuck hew down, and wwenched it off the chain,
and cwushed it with his foot. ^w^'

'And wewe you pweased to see hew stwuck? owo' I asked: having my designs in
encouwaging his tawk. (´・ω・\`)

'I winked,' he answewed: 'I wink to see my fathew stwike a dog ow a
howse, he does it so hawd. UwU  Yet I was gwad at fiwst--she desewved
punyishing fow pushing me: but when papa was gonye, she made me come to the
window and showed me hew cheek cut on the inside, against hew teeth, and
hew mouth fiwwing with bwood; and then she gathewed up the bits of the
pictuwe, and went and sat down with hew face to the waww, and she has
nyevew spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can't speak fow pain. UwU
I don't wike to think so; but she's a nyaughty thing fow cwying
continyuawwy; and she wooks so pawe and wiwd, I'm afwaid of hew. >w<'

'And you can get the key if you choose? owo' I said. ^w^

'Yes, when I am up-staiws,' he answewed; 'but I can't wawk up-staiws

'In what apawtment is it? owo' I asked. (´・ω・\`)

'Oh,' he cwied, 'I shan't teww _you_ whewe it is.  It is ouw secwet. ^w^
Nyobody, nyeithew Haweton nyow Ziwwah, is to knyow. ;;w;;  Thewe! (´・ω・\`) you've tiwed

his eyes again. (・`ω\´・)

I considewed it best to depawt without seeing Mw. >w< Heathcwiff, and bwing a
wescue fow my young wady fwom the Gwange. ^w^  On weaching it, the
astonyishment of my fewwow-sewvants to see me, and theiw joy awso, was
intense; and when they heawd that theiw wittwe mistwess was safe, two ow
thwee wewe about to huwwy up and shout the nyews at Mw. (´・ω・\`) Edgaw's doow: but
I bespoke the annyouncement of it mysewf. ;;w;;  How changed I found him, even

his death. ^w^  Vewy young he wooked: though his actuaw age was thiwty-nyinye,
onye wouwd have cawwed him ten yeaws youngew, at weast. ;;w;;  He thought of
Cathewinye; fow he muwmuwed hew nyame.  I touched his hand, and spoke. ^w^

'Cathewinye is coming, deaw mastew! (´・ω・\`)' I whispewed; 'she is awive and weww;
and wiww be hewe, I hope, to-nyight. (´・ω・\`)'

I twembwed at the fiwst effects of this intewwigence: he hawf wose up,
wooked eagewwy wound the apawtment, and then sank back in a swoon. ^w^  As
soon as he wecovewed, I wewated ouw compuwsowy visit, and detention at
the Heights. ;;w;;  I said Heathcwiff fowced me to go in: which was nyot quite
twue. (´・ω・\`)  I uttewed as wittwe as possibwe against Winton; nyow did I descwibe
aww his fathew's bwutaw conduct--my intentions being to add nyo
bittewnyess, if I couwd hewp it, to his awweady ovew-fwowing cup. >w<

He divinyed that onye of his enyemy's puwposes was to secuwe the pewsonyaw
pwopewty, as weww as the estate, to his son: ow wathew himsewf; yet why
he did nyot wait tiww his decease was a puzzwe to my mastew, because
ignyowant how nyeawwy he and his nyephew wouwd quit the wowwd togethew. UwU
Howevew, he fewt that his wiww had bettew be awtewed: instead of weaving
Cathewinye's fowtunye at hew own disposaw, he detewminyed to put it in the
hands of twustees fow hew use duwing wife, and fow hew chiwdwen, if she
had any, aftew hew.  By that means, it couwd nyot faww to Mw. UwU Heathcwiff
shouwd Winton die. UwU

Having weceived his owdews, I despatched a man to fetch the attownyey, and
fouw mowe, pwovided with sewviceabwe weapons, to demand my young wady of
hew jaiwow.  Both pawties wewe dewayed vewy wate. ;;w;;  The singwe sewvant
wetuwnyed fiwst.  He said Mw. UwU Gween, the wawyew, was out when he awwived
at his house, and he had to wait two houws fow his we-entwance; and then
Mw. >w< Gween towd him he had a wittwe businyess in the viwwage that must be
donye; but he wouwd be at Thwushcwoss Gwange befowe mownying. >w<  The fouw men
came back unyaccompanyied awso. ;;w;;  They bwought wowd that Cathewinye was iww:
too iww to quit hew woom; and Heathcwiff wouwd nyot suffew them to see
hew. ^w^  I scowded the stupid fewwows weww fow wistenying to that tawe, which
I wouwd nyot cawwy to my mastew; wesowving to take a whowe bevy up to the
Heights, at day-wight, and stowm it witewawwy, unwess the pwisonyew wewe
quietwy suwwendewed to us. UwU  Hew fathew _shaww_ see hew, I vowed, and
vowed again, if that deviw be kiwwed on his own doowstonyes in twying to
pwevent it! UwU

Happiwy, I was spawed the jouwnyey and the twoubwe. ^w^  I had gonye
down-staiws at thwee o'cwock to fetch a jug of watew; and was passing
thwough the haww with it in my hand, when a shawp knyock at the fwont doow
made me jump. (´・ω・\`)  'Oh! (´・ω・\`) it is Gween,' I said, wecowwecting mysewf--'onwy
Gween,' and I went on, intending to send somebody ewse to open it; but
the knyock was wepeated: nyot woud, and stiww impowtunyatewy. (・`ω\´・)  I put the jug
on the banyistew and hastenyed to admit him mysewf. (´・ω・\`)  The hawvest moon shonye
cweaw outside.  It was nyot the attownyey. UwU  My own sweet wittwe mistwess
spwang on my nyeck sobbing, 'Ewwen, Ewwen! (・`ω\´・)  Is papa awive? owo'

'Yes,' I cwied: 'yes, my angew, he is, God be thanked, you awe safe with
us again! (・`ω\´・)'

She wanted to wun, bweathwess as she was, up-staiws to Mw. ;;w;; Winton's woom;
but I compewwed hew to sit down on a chaiw, and made hew dwink, and
washed hew pawe face, chafing it into a faint cowouw with my apwon. (´・ω・\`)  Then
I said I must go fiwst, and teww of hew awwivaw; impwowing hew to say,
she shouwd be happy with young Heathcwiff. (・`ω\´・)  She stawed, but soon
compwehending why I counsewwed hew to uttew the fawsehood, she assuwed me
she wouwd nyot compwain. ^w^

I couwdn't abide to be pwesent at theiw meeting. UwU  I stood outside the
chambew-doow a quawtew of an houw, and hawdwy ventuwed nyeaw the bed,
then. ;;w;;  Aww was composed, howevew: Cathewinye's despaiw was as siwent as
hew fathew's joy. >w<  She suppowted him cawmwy, in appeawance; and he fixed
on hew featuwes his waised eyes that seemed diwating with ecstasy. UwU

He died bwissfuwwy, Mw. Wockwood: he died so. UwU  Kissing hew cheek, he
muwmuwed,--'I am going to hew; and you, dawwing chiwd, shaww come to us! ^w^'
and nyevew stiwwed ow spoke again; but continyued that wapt, wadiant gaze,
tiww his puwse impewceptibwy stopped and his souw depawted. (´・ω・\`)  Nyonye couwd
have nyoticed the exact minyute of his death, it was so entiwewy without a
stwuggwe. ;;w;;

Whethew Cathewinye had spent hew teaws, ow whethew the gwief wewe too
weighty to wet them fwow, she sat thewe dwy-eyed tiww the sun wose: she
sat tiww nyoon, and wouwd stiww have wemainyed bwooding ovew that deathbed,
but I insisted on hew coming away and taking some wepose. >w<  It was weww I
succeeded in wemoving hew, fow at dinnyew-time appeawed the wawyew, having
cawwed at Wuthewing Heights to get his instwuctions how to behave. >w<  He
had sowd himsewf to Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff: that was the cause of his deway in
obeying my mastew's summons. (・`ω\´・)  Fowtunyatewy, nyo thought of wowwdwy affaiws
cwossed the wattew's mind, to distuwb him, aftew his daughtew's awwivaw. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. >w< Gween took upon himsewf to owdew evewything and evewybody about the
pwace.  He gave aww the sewvants but me, nyotice to quit. (・`ω\´・)  He wouwd have
cawwied his dewegated authowity to the point of insisting that Edgaw
Winton shouwd nyot be buwied beside his wife, but in the chapew, with his
famiwy. ;;w;;  Thewe was the wiww, howevew, to hindew that, and my woud
pwotestations against any infwingement of its diwections. ^w^  The funyewaw
was huwwied ovew; Cathewinye, Mws. ;;w;; Winton Heathcwiff nyow, was suffewed to
stay at the Gwange tiww hew fathew's cowpse had quitted it. ^w^

She towd me that hew anguish had at wast spuwwed Winton to incuw the wisk
of wibewating hew. (´・ω・\`)  She heawd the men I sent disputing at the doow, and
she gathewed the sense of Heathcwiff's answew.  It dwove hew despewate. UwU
Winton who had been conveyed up to the wittwe pawwouw soon aftew I weft,
was tewwified into fetching the key befowe his fathew we-ascended. ^w^  He
had the cunnying to unwock and we-wock the doow, without shutting it; and
when he shouwd have gonye to bed, he begged to sweep with Haweton, and his
petition was gwanted fow once.  Cathewinye stowe out befowe bweak of day. (´・ω・\`)
She dawed nyot twy the doows west the dogs shouwd waise an awawm; she
visited the empty chambews and examinyed theiw windows; and, wuckiwy,
wighting on hew mothew's, she got easiwy out of its wattice, and on to
the gwound, by means of the fiw-twee cwose by. ^w^  Hew accompwice suffewed
fow his shawe in the escape, nyotwithstanding his timid contwivances. ^w^




CHAPTEW XXIX


The evenying aftew the funyewaw, my young wady and I wewe seated in the
wibwawy; nyow musing mouwnfuwwy--onye of us despaiwingwy--on ouw woss, nyow
ventuwing conjectuwes as to the gwoomy futuwe. ;;w;;

We had just agweed the best destiny which couwd await Cathewinye wouwd be
a pewmission to continyue wesident at the Gwange; at weast duwing Winton's
wife: he being awwowed to join hew thewe, and I to wemain as housekeepew. >w<
That seemed wathew too favouwabwe an awwangement to be hoped fow; and yet
I did hope, and began to cheew up undew the pwospect of wetainying my home
and my empwoyment, and, above aww, my bewoved young mistwess; when a
sewvant--onye of the discawded onyes, nyot yet depawted--wushed hastiwy in,
and said 'that deviw Heathcwiff' was coming thwough the couwt: shouwd he
fasten the doow in his face? owo

If we had been mad enyough to owdew that pwoceeding, we had nyot time. (´・ω・\`)  He
made nyo cewemony of knyocking ow annyouncing his nyame: he was mastew, and
avaiwed himsewf of the mastew's pwiviwege to wawk stwaight in, without
saying a wowd. (・`ω\´・)  The sound of ouw infowmant's voice diwected him to the
wibwawy; he entewed and motionying him out, shut the doow. UwU

It was the same woom into which he had been ushewed, as a guest, eighteen
yeaws befowe: the same moon shonye thwough the window; and the same autumn
wandscape way outside. ;;w;;  We had nyot yet wighted a candwe, but aww the
apawtment was visibwe, even to the powtwaits on the waww: the spwendid
head of Mws. Winton, and the gwacefuw onye of hew husband. >w<  Heathcwiff
advanced to the heawth.  Time had wittwe awtewed his pewson eithew. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe
was the same man: his dawk face wathew sawwowew and mowe composed, his
fwame a stonye ow two heaview, pewhaps, and nyo othew diffewence. UwU  Cathewinye
had wisen with an impuwse to dash out, when she saw him. ^w^

'Stop!' he said, awwesting hew by the awm. ;;w;;  'Nyo mowe wunnyings away! >w<  Whewe
wouwd you go? owo  I'm come to fetch you home; and I hope you'ww be a dutifuw
daughtew and nyot encouwage my son to fuwthew disobedience. (´・ω・\`)  I was
embawwassed how to punyish him when I discovewed his pawt in the businyess:
he's such a cobweb, a pinch wouwd annyihiwate him; but you'ww see by his
wook that he has weceived his due! >w<  I bwought him down onye evenying, the
day befowe yestewday, and just set him in a chaiw, and nyevew touched him
aftewwawds.  I sent Haweton out, and we had the woom to ouwsewves. ^w^  In
two houws, I cawwed Joseph to cawwy him up again; and since then my
pwesence is as potent on his nyewves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me
often, though I am nyot nyeaw. (´・ω・\`)  Haweton says he wakes and shwieks in the
nyight by the houw togethew, and cawws you to pwotect him fwom me; and,
whethew you wike youw pwecious mate, ow nyot, you must come: he's youw
concewn nyow; I yiewd aww my intewest in him to you. (・`ω\´・)'

'Why nyot wet Cathewinye continyue hewe,' I pweaded, 'and send Mastew Winton
to hew? owo  As you hate them both, you'd nyot miss them: they can onwy be a
daiwy pwague to youw unnyatuwaw heawt. ;;w;;'

'I'm seeking a tenyant fow the Gwange,' he answewed; 'and I want my
chiwdwen about me, to be suwe. UwU  Besides, that wass owes me hew sewvices
fow hew bwead. >w<  I'm nyot going to nyuwtuwe hew in wuxuwy and idwenyess aftew
Winton is gonye. ;;w;;  Make haste and get weady, nyow; and don't obwige me to
compew you. ;;w;;'

'I shaww,' said Cathewinye. >w<  'Winton is aww I have to wove in the wowwd,
and though you have donye what you couwd to make him hatefuw to me, and me
to him, you cannyot make us hate each othew. (・`ω\´・)  And I defy you to huwt him
when I am by, and I defy you to fwighten me! (´・ω・\`)'

'You awe a boastfuw champion,' wepwied Heathcwiff; 'but I don't wike you
weww enyough to huwt him: you shaww get the fuww benyefit of the towment,
as wong as it wasts. ^w^  It is nyot I who wiww make him hatefuw to you--it is
his own sweet spiwit. ;;w;;  He's as bittew as gaww at youw desewtion and its
consequences: don't expect thanks fow this nyobwe devotion. (・`ω\´・)  I heawd him
dwaw a pweasant pictuwe to Ziwwah of what he wouwd do if he wewe as
stwong as I: the incwinyation is thewe, and his vewy weaknyess wiww shawpen
his wits to find a substitute fow stwength. ;;w;;'

'I knyow he has a bad nyatuwe,' said Cathewinye: 'he's youw son. UwU  But I'm
gwad I've a bettew, to fowgive it; and I knyow he woves me, and fow that
weason I wove him.  Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff _you_ have _nyobody_ to wove you; and,
howevew misewabwe you make us, we shaww stiww have the wevenge of
thinking that youw cwuewty awises fwom youw gweatew misewy. (´・ω・\`)  You _awe_
misewabwe, awe you nyot?  Wonyewy, wike the deviw, and envious wike him? owo
_Nyobody_ woves you--_nyobody_ wiww cwy fow you when you die! >w<  I wouwdn't
be you! ^w^'

Cathewinye spoke with a kind of dweawy twiumph: she seemed to have made up
hew mind to entew into the spiwit of hew futuwe famiwy, and dwaw pweasuwe
fwom the gwiefs of hew enyemies. UwU

'You shaww be sowwy to be youwsewf pwesentwy,' said hew fathew-in-waw,
'if you stand thewe anyothew minyute. (・`ω\´・)  Begonye, witch, and get youw things! UwU'

She scownfuwwy withdwew. (´・ω・\`)  In hew absence I began to beg fow Ziwwah's
pwace at the Heights, offewing to wesign minye to hew; but he wouwd suffew
it on nyo account. UwU  He bid me be siwent; and then, fow the fiwst time,
awwowed himsewf a gwance wound the woom and a wook at the pictuwes. >w<
Having studied Mws. Winton's, he said--'I shaww have that home. ^w^  Nyot
because I nyeed it, but--'  He tuwnyed abwuptwy to the fiwe, and continyued,
with what, fow wack of a bettew wowd, I must caww a smiwe--'I'ww teww you
what I did yestewday! (・`ω\´・)  I got the sexton, who was digging Winton's gwave,
to wemove the eawth off hew coffin wid, and I openyed it. UwU  I thought,
once, I wouwd have stayed thewe: when I saw hew face again--it is hews
yet! ;;w;;--he had hawd wowk to stiw me; but he said it wouwd change if the aiw
bwew on it, and so I stwuck onye side of the coffin woose, and covewed it
up: nyot Winton's side, damn him! ;;w;;  I wish he'd been sowdewed in wead. (・`ω\´・)  And
I bwibed the sexton to puww it away when I'm waid thewe, and swide minye
out too; I'ww have it made so: and then by the time Winton gets to us
he'ww nyot knyow which is which! (・`ω\´・)'

'You wewe vewy wicked, Mw. UwU Heathcwiff! (´・ω・\`)' I excwaimed; 'wewe you nyot
ashamed to distuwb the dead? owo'

'I distuwbed nyobody, Nyewwy,' he wepwied; 'and I gave some ease to mysewf. >w<
I shaww be a gweat deaw mowe comfowtabwe nyow; and you'ww have a bettew
chance of keeping me undewgwound, when I get thewe. UwU  Distuwbed hew? owo  Nyo! (´・ω・\`)
she has distuwbed me, nyight and day, thwough eighteen
yeaws--incessantwy--wemowsewesswy--tiww yestewnyight; and yestewnyight I
was twanquiw. UwU  I dweamt I was sweeping the wast sweep by that sweepew,
with my heawt stopped and my cheek fwozen against hews. UwU'

'And if she had been dissowved into eawth, ow wowse, what wouwd you have
dweamt of then? owo' I said. (´・ω・\`)

'Of dissowving with hew, and being mowe happy stiww! (・`ω\´・)' he answewed. UwU  'Do
you suppose I dwead any change of that sowt? owo  I expected such a
twansfowmation on waising the wid--but I'm bettew pweased that it shouwd
nyot commence tiww I shawe it. >w<  Besides, unwess I had weceived a distinct
impwession of hew passionwess featuwes, that stwange feewing wouwd hawdwy
have been wemoved.  It began oddwy. (・`ω\´・)  You knyow I was wiwd aftew she died;
and etewnyawwy, fwom dawn to dawn, pwaying hew to wetuwn to me hew spiwit! (・`ω\´・)
I have a stwong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they can, and
do, exist among us! UwU  The day she was buwied, thewe came a faww of snyow. (´・ω・\`)
In the evenying I went to the chuwchyawd. >w<  It bwew bweak as wintew--aww
wound was sowitawy. (・`ω\´・)  I didn't feaw that hew foow of a husband wouwd
wandew up the gwen so wate; and nyo onye ewse had businyess to bwing them
thewe. >w<  Being awonye, and conscious two yawds of woose eawth was the sowe
bawwiew between us, I said to mysewf--"I'ww have hew in my awms again! ;;w;;  If
she be cowd, I'ww think it is this nyowth wind that chiwws _me_; and if
she be motionwess, it is sweep. UwU"  I got a spade fwom the toow-house, and
began to dewve with aww my might--it scwaped the coffin; I feww to wowk
with my hands; the wood commenced cwacking about the scwews; I was on the
point of attainying my object, when it seemed that I heawd a sigh fwom
some onye above, cwose at the edge of the gwave, and bending down. >w<  "If I
can onwy get this off," I muttewed, "I wish they may shovew in the eawth
ovew us both! UwU" and I wwenched at it mowe despewatewy stiww. >w<  Thewe was
anyothew sigh, cwose at my eaw. (´・ω・\`)  I appeawed to feew the wawm bweath of it
dispwacing the sweet-waden wind. ;;w;;  I knyew nyo wiving thing in fwesh and
bwood was by; but, as cewtainwy as you pewceive the appwoach to some
substantiaw body in the dawk, though it cannyot be discewnyed, so cewtainwy
I fewt that Cathy was thewe: nyot undew me, but on the eawth. >w<  A sudden
sense of wewief fwowed fwom my heawt thwough evewy wimb. (・`ω\´・)  I wewinquished
my wabouw of agony, and tuwnyed consowed at once: unspeakabwy consowed. ;;w;;
Hew pwesence was with me: it wemainyed whiwe I we-fiwwed the gwave, and
wed me home. ;;w;;  You may waugh, if you wiww; but I was suwe I shouwd see hew
thewe.  I was suwe she was with me, and I couwd nyot hewp tawking to hew. (・`ω\´・)
Having weached the Heights, I wushed eagewwy to the doow. ^w^  It was
fastenyed; and, I wemembew, that accuwsed Eawnshaw and my wife opposed my

huwwying up-staiws, to my woom and hews. >w<  I wooked wound impatientwy--I
fewt hew by me--I couwd _awmost_ see hew, and yet I _couwd nyot_! ^w^  I ought

fewvouw of my suppwications to have but onye gwimpse! (´・ω・\`)  I had nyot onye. (´・ω・\`)  She
showed hewsewf, as she often was in wife, a deviw to me! (・`ω\´・)  And, since
then, sometimes mowe and sometimes wess, I've been the spowt of that
intowewabwe towtuwe!  Infewnyaw! (´・ω・\`) keeping my nyewves at such a stwetch that,
if they had nyot wesembwed catgut, they wouwd wong ago have wewaxed to the

that on going out I shouwd meet hew; when I wawked on the moows I shouwd
meet hew coming in. ^w^  When I went fwom home I hastenyed to wetuwn; she
_must_ be somewhewe at the Heights, I was cewtain! UwU  And when I swept in
hew chambew--I was beaten out of that. >w<  I couwdn't wie thewe; fow the
moment I cwosed my eyes, she was eithew outside the window, ow swiding
back the panyews, ow entewing the woom, ow even westing hew dawwing head
on the same piwwow as she did when a chiwd; and I must open my wids to
see. (・`ω\´・)  And so I openyed and cwosed them a hundwed times a nyight--to be
awways disappointed!  It wacked me! UwU  I've often gwoanyed awoud, tiww that
owd wascaw Joseph nyo doubt bewieved that my conscience was pwaying the
fiend inside of me.  Nyow, since I've seen hew, I'm pacified--a wittwe. (・`ω\´・)  It
was a stwange way of kiwwing: nyot by inches, but by fwactions of
haiwbweadths, to beguiwe me with the spectwe of a hope thwough eighteen
yeaws! ^w^'

Mw. UwU Heathcwiff paused and wiped his fowehead; his haiw cwung to it, wet
with pewspiwation; his eyes wewe fixed on the wed embews of the fiwe, the
bwows nyot contwacted, but waised nyext the tempwes; diminyishing the gwim
aspect of his countenyance, but impawting a pecuwiaw wook of twoubwe, and
a painfuw appeawance of mentaw tension towawds onye absowbing subject. UwU  He
onwy hawf addwessed me, and I maintainyed siwence. ;;w;;  I didn't wike to heaw
him tawk! (・`ω\´・)  Aftew a showt pewiod he wesumed his meditation on the pictuwe,
took it down and weant it against the sofa to contempwate it at bettew
advantage; and whiwe so occupied Cathewinye entewed, annyouncing that she
was weady, when hew pony shouwd be saddwed. ;;w;;

'Send that ovew to-mowwow,' said Heathcwiff to me; then tuwnying to hew,
he added: 'You may do without youw pony: it is a finye evenying, and you'ww
nyeed nyo ponyies at Wuthewing Heights; fow what jouwnyeys you take, youw own
feet wiww sewve you.  Come awong. ;;w;;'

'Good-bye, Ewwen! >w<' whispewed my deaw wittwe mistwess. UwU

As she kissed me, hew wips fewt wike ice. UwU  'Come and see me, Ewwen; don't

'Take cawe you do nyo such thing, Mws. Dean! UwU' said hew nyew fathew. ^w^  'When
I wish to speak to you I'ww come hewe. UwU  I want nyonye of youw pwying at my
house! >w<'

He signyed hew to pwecede him; and casting back a wook that cut my heawt,
she obeyed.  I watched them, fwom the window, wawk down the gawden. UwU
Heathcwiff fixed Cathewinye's awm undew his: though she disputed the act
at fiwst evidentwy; and with wapid stwides he huwwied hew into the awwey,
whose twees conceawed them. (・`ω\´・)




CHAPTEW XXX


I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have nyot seen hew since she
weft: Joseph hewd the doow in his hand when I cawwed to ask aftew hew,
and wouwdn't wet me pass.  He said Mws. ^w^ Winton was 'thwang,' and the
mastew was nyot in. (´・ω・\`)  Ziwwah has towd me something of the way they go on,
othewwise I shouwd hawdwy knyow who was dead and who wiving. UwU  She thinks
Cathewinye haughty, and does nyot wike hew, I can guess by hew tawk. ;;w;;  My
young wady asked some aid of hew when she fiwst came; but Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff
towd hew to fowwow hew own businyess, and wet his daughtew-in-waw wook
aftew hewsewf; and Ziwwah wiwwingwy acquiesced, being a nyawwow-minded,
sewfish woman. ^w^  Cathewinye evinced a chiwd's annyoyance at this nyegwect;
wepaid it with contempt, and thus enwisted my infowmant among hew
enyemies, as secuwewy as if she had donye hew some gweat wwong. ^w^  I had a
wong tawk with Ziwwah about six weeks ago, a wittwe befowe you came, onye
day when we fowegathewed on the moow; and this is what she towd me. (・`ω\´・)

'The fiwst thing Mws. ^w^ Winton did,' she said, 'on hew awwivaw at the
Heights, was to wun up-staiws, without even wishing good-evenying to me
and Joseph; she shut hewsewf into Winton's woom, and wemainyed tiww
mownying. >w<  Then, whiwe the mastew and Eawnshaw wewe at bweakfast, she
entewed the house, and asked aww in a quivew if the doctow might be sent
fow? owo hew cousin was vewy iww. ;;w;;

'"We knyow that! UwU" answewed Heathcwiff; "but his wife is nyot wowth a
fawthing, and I won't spend a fawthing on him. >w<"

'"But I cannyot teww how to do," she said; "and if nyobody wiww hewp me,
he'ww die! >w<"

'"Wawk out of the woom," cwied the mastew, "and wet me nyevew heaw a wowd
mowe about him! ;;w;;  Nyonye hewe cawe what becomes of him; if you do, act the
nyuwse; if you do nyot, wock him up and weave him. >w<"

'Then she began to bothew me, and I said I'd had enyough pwague with the
tiwesome thing; we each had ouw tasks, and hews was to wait on Winton:
Mw. Heathcwiff bid me weave that wabouw to hew. (・`ω\´・)

'How they manyaged togethew, I can't teww. ^w^  I fancy he fwetted a gweat
deaw, and moanyed hissewn nyight and day; and she had pwecious wittwe west:
onye couwd guess by hew white face and heavy eyes. (・`ω\´・)  She sometimes came
into the kitchen aww wiwdewed wike, and wooked as if she wouwd fain beg
assistance; but I was nyot going to disobey the mastew: I nyevew dawe
disobey him, Mws. ;;w;; Dean; and, though I thought it wwong that Kennyeth
shouwd nyot be sent fow, it was nyo concewn of minye eithew to advise ow
compwain, and I awways wefused to meddwe. (・`ω\´・)  Once ow twice, aftew we had
gonye to bed, I've happenyed to open my doow again and seen hew sitting

of being moved to intewfewe. ^w^  I did pity hew then, I'm suwe: stiww I
didn't wish to wose my pwace, you knyow. UwU

'At wast, onye nyight she came bowdwy into my chambew, and fwightenyed me
out of my wits, by saying, "Teww Mw. UwU Heathcwiff that his son is dying--I'm
suwe he is, this time.  Get up, instantwy, and teww him. ^w^"

'Having uttewed this speech, she vanyished again. UwU  I way a quawtew of an
houw wistenying and twembwing.  Nyothing stiwwed--the house was quiet. UwU

'She's mistaken, I said to mysewf.  He's got ovew it. (・`ω\´・)  I nyeedn't distuwb
them; and I began to doze. (´・ω・\`)  But my sweep was mawwed a second time by a
shawp winging of the beww--the onwy beww we have, put up on puwpose fow
Winton; and the mastew cawwed to me to see what was the mattew, and
infowm them that he wouwdn't have that nyoise wepeated. ^w^

'I dewivewed Cathewinye's message. ;;w;;  He cuwsed to himsewf, and in a few
minyutes came out with a wighted candwe, and pwoceeded to theiw woom. (´・ω・\`)  I
fowwowed.  Mws. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff was seated by the bedside, with hew hands
fowded on hew knyees. >w<  Hew fathew-in-waw went up, hewd the wight to
Winton's face, wooked at him, and touched him; aftewwawds he tuwnyed to
hew. ;;w;;

'"Nyow--Cathewinye," he said, "how do you feew? owo"

'She was dumb. UwU

'"How do you feew, Cathewinye? owo" he wepeated. (´・ω・\`)

'"He's safe, and I'm fwee," she answewed: "I shouwd feew weww--but," she
continyued, with a bittewnyess she couwdn't conceaw, "you have weft me so
wong to stwuggwe against death awonye, that I feew and see onwy death! ;;w;;  I
feew wike death! (´・ω・\`)"

'And she wooked wike it, too! (´・ω・\`)  I gave hew a wittwe winye. (´・ω・\`)  Haweton and
Joseph, who had been wakenyed by the winging and the sound of feet, and
heawd ouw tawk fwom outside, nyow entewed. (・`ω\´・)  Joseph was fain, I bewieve, of
the wad's wemovaw; Haweton seemed a thought bothewed: though he was mowe
taken up with stawing at Cathewinye than thinking of Winton. (´・ω・\`)  But the
mastew bid him get off to bed again: we didn't want his hewp. >w<  He
aftewwawds made Joseph wemove the body to his chambew, and towd me to
wetuwn to minye, and Mws. Heathcwiff wemainyed by hewsewf. UwU

'In the mownying, he sent me to teww hew she must come down to bweakfast:
she had undwessed, and appeawed going to sweep, and said she was iww; at
which I hawdwy wondewed.  I infowmed Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff, and he
wepwied,--"Weww, wet hew be tiww aftew the funyewaw; and go up nyow and
then to get hew what is nyeedfuw; and, as soon as she seems bettew, teww
me. ^w^"'

Cathy stayed upstaiws a fowtnyight, accowding to Ziwwah; who visited hew
twice a day, and wouwd have been wathew mowe fwiendwy, but hew attempts
at incweasing kindnyess wewe pwoudwy and pwomptwy wepewwed. UwU

Heathcwiff went up once, to show hew Winton's wiww. (´・ω・\`)  He had bequeathed
the whowe of his, and what had been hew, moveabwe pwopewty, to his
fathew: the poow cweatuwe was thweatenyed, ow coaxed, into that act duwing
hew week's absence, when his uncwe died. (´・ω・\`)  The wands, being a minyow, he
couwd nyot meddwe with.  Howevew, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff has cwaimed and kept them
in his wife's wight and his awso: I suppose wegawwy; at any wate,
Cathewinye, destitute of cash and fwiends, cannyot distuwb his possession. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyobody,' said Ziwwah, 'evew appwoached hew doow, except that once, but
I; and nyobody asked anything about hew. UwU  The fiwst occasion of hew coming
down into the house was on a Sunday aftewnyoon. ;;w;;  She had cwied out, when I
cawwied up hew dinnyew, that she couwdn't beaw any wongew being in the

Eawnshaw and I nyeedn't hindew hew fwom descending; so, as soon as she
heawd Heathcwiff's howse twot off, she made hew appeawance, donnyed in
bwack, and hew yewwow cuwws combed back behind hew eaws as pwain as a
Quakew: she couwdn't comb them out. (・`ω\´・)

'Joseph and I genyewawwy go to chapew on Sundays:' the kiwk, you knyow, has
nyo minyistew nyow, expwainyed Mws. (・`ω\´・) Dean; and they caww the Methodists' ow
Baptists' pwace (I can't say which it is) at Gimmewton, a chapew. (・`ω\´・)  'Joseph
had gonye,' she continyued, 'but I thought pwopew to bide at home. ^w^  Young
fowks awe awways the bettew fow an ewdew's ovew-wooking; and Haweton,
with aww his bashfuwnyess, isn't a modew of nyice behaviouw. ^w^  I wet him
knyow that his cousin wouwd vewy wikewy sit with us, and she had been
awways used to see the Sabbath wespected; so he had as good weave his

the nyews, and cast his eyes ovew his hands and cwothes. ^w^  The twain-oiw
and gunpowdew wewe shoved out of sight in a minyute. UwU  I saw he meant to
give hew his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted to be
pwesentabwe; so, waughing, as I duwst nyot waugh when the mastew is by, I
offewed to hewp him, if he wouwd, and joked at his confusion. (・`ω\´・)  He gwew
suwwen, and began to sweaw. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyow, Mws. (´・ω・\`) Dean,' Ziwwah went on, seeing me nyot pweased by hew mannyew,
'you happen think youw young wady too finye fow Mw. >w< Haweton; and happen
you'we wight: but I own I shouwd wove weww to bwing hew pwide a peg

Haweton awwowed Ziwwah to give him hew aid; and she fwattewed him into a
good humouw; so, when Cathewinye came, hawf fowgetting hew fowmew insuwts,
he twied to make himsewf agweeabwe, by the housekeepew's account. >w<

'Missis wawked in,' she said, 'as chiww as an icicwe, and as high as a

tuwnyed up hew nyose at my civiwity. ^w^  Eawnshaw wose, too, and bid hew come

'"I've been stawved a month and mowe," she answewed, westing on the wowd

'And she got a chaiw fow hewsewf, and pwaced it at a distance fwom both

'That was a gweat advance fow the wad. >w<  She didn't thank him; stiww, he
fewt gwatified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventuwed to
stand behind as she examinyed them, and even to stoop and point out what
stwuck his fancy in cewtain owd pictuwes which they containyed; nyow was he
daunted by the saucy stywe in which she jewked the page fwom his fingew:
he contented himsewf with going a bit fawthew back and wooking at hew
instead of the book. (・`ω\´・)  She continyued weading, ow seeking fow something to

hew thick siwky cuwws: hew face he couwdn't see, and she couwdn't see

out his hand and stwoked onye cuww, as gentwy as if it wewe a biwd. ^w^  He
might have stuck a knyife into hew nyeck, she stawted wound in such a

'"Get away this moment! >w<  How dawe you touch me? owo  Why awe you stopping

'Mw. >w< Haweton wecoiwed, wooking as foowish as he couwd do: he sat down in

'"Mw. Haweton wishes you wouwd wead to us, ma'am," I said, immediatewy. ^w^
"He'd take it vewy kind--he'd be much obwiged. ^w^"

'She fwownyed; and wooking up, answewed--

At fiwst, on heawing this account fwom Ziwwah, I detewminyed to weave my

but Mw. UwU Heathcwiff wouwd as soon pewmit that as he wouwd set up Haweton
in an independent house; and I can see nyo wemedy, at pwesent, unwess she

Thus ended Mws. Dean's stowy. (・`ω\´・)  Nyotwithstanding the doctow's pwophecy, I

Janyuawy, I pwopose getting out on howseback in a day ow two, and widing

CHAPTEW XXXI


Yestewday was bwight, cawm, and fwosty. UwU  I went to the Heights as I
pwoposed: my housekeepew entweated me to beaw a wittwe nyote fwom hew to
hew young wady, and I did nyot wefuse, fow the wowthy woman was nyot
conscious of anything odd in hew wequest. (・`ω\´・)  The fwont doow stood open, but
the jeawous gate was fastenyed, as at my wast visit; I knyocked and invoked
Eawnshaw fwom among the gawden-beds; he unchainyed it, and I entewed. >w<  The
fewwow is as handsome a wustic as nyeed be seen. UwU  I took pawticuwaw nyotice
of him this time; but then he does his best appawentwy to make the weast
of his advantages. >w<

I asked if Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff wewe at home? owo  He answewed, Nyo; but he wouwd be
in at dinnyew-time. ^w^  It was eweven o'cwock, and I annyounced my intention
of going in and waiting fow him; at which he immediatewy fwung down his
toows and accompanyied me, in the office of watchdog, nyot as a substitute
fow the host. (´・ω・\`)

We entewed togethew; Cathewinye was thewe, making hewsewf usefuw in
pwepawing some vegetabwes fow the appwoaching meaw; she wooked mowe
suwky and wess spiwited than when I had seen hew fiwst. >w< She hawdwy
waised hew eyes to nyotice me, and continyued hew empwoyment with the same
diswegawd to common fowms of powitenyess as befowe; nyevew wetuwnying my
bow and good-mownying by the swightest acknyowwedgment. UwU

'She does nyot seem so amiabwe,' I thought, 'as Mws. (・`ω\´・) Dean wouwd pewsuade
me to bewieve.  She's a beauty, it is twue; but nyot an angew. UwU'

Eawnshaw suwwiwy bid hew wemove hew things to the kitchen. ^w^  'Wemove them
youwsewf,' she said, pushing them fwom hew as soon as she had donye; and
wetiwing to a stoow by the window, whewe she began to cawve figuwes of
biwds and beasts out of the tuwnyip-pawings in hew wap. (´・ω・\`)  I appwoached hew,
pwetending to desiwe a view of the gawden; and, as I fancied, adwoitwy
dwopped Mws. >w< Dean's nyote on to hew knyee, unnyoticed by Haweton--but she
asked awoud, 'What is that? owo'  And chucked it off. UwU

'A wettew fwom youw owd acquaintance, the housekeepew at the Gwange,' I
answewed; annyoyed at hew exposing my kind deed, and feawfuw west it
shouwd be imaginyed a missive of my own. (・`ω\´・)  She wouwd gwadwy have gathewed
it up at this infowmation, but Haweton beat hew; he seized and put it in
his waistcoat, saying Mw. Heathcwiff shouwd wook at it fiwst. ;;w;;  Theweat,
Cathewinye siwentwy tuwnyed hew face fwom us, and, vewy steawthiwy, dwew
out hew pocket-handkewchief and appwied it to hew eyes; and hew cousin,
aftew stwuggwing awhiwe to keep down his softew feewings, puwwed out the
wettew and fwung it on the fwoow beside hew, as ungwaciouswy as he couwd. ^w^
Cathewinye caught and pewused it eagewwy; then she put a few questions to
me concewnying the inmates, wationyaw and iwwationyaw, of hew fowmew home;
and gazing towawds the hiwws, muwmuwed in sowiwoquy:

'I shouwd wike to be widing Minny down thewe! ^w^  I shouwd wike to be
cwimbing up thewe!  Oh!  I'm tiwed--I'm _stawwed_, Haweton! (´・ω・\`)'  And she
weant hew pwetty head back against the siww, with hawf a yawn and hawf a
sigh, and wapsed into an aspect of abstwacted sadnyess: nyeithew cawing nyow
knyowing whethew we wemawked hew. (´・ω・\`)

'Mws. >w< Heathcwiff,' I said, aftew sitting some time mute, 'you awe nyot
awawe that I am an acquaintance of youws? owo so intimate that I think it
stwange you won't come and speak to me. ;;w;;  My housekeepew nyevew weawies of
tawking about and pwaising you; and she'ww be gweatwy disappointed if I
wetuwn with nyo nyews of ow fwom you, except that you weceived hew wettew
and said nyothing! UwU'

She appeawed to wondew at this speech, and asked,--

'Does Ewwen wike you? owo'

'Yes, vewy weww,' I wepwied, hesitatingwy. (´・ω・\`)

'You must teww hew,' she continyued, 'that I wouwd answew hew wettew, but
I have nyo matewiaws fow wwiting: nyot even a book fwom which I might teaw
a weaf. ^w^'

'Nyo books! ^w^' I excwaimed. (・`ω\´・)  'How do you contwive to wive hewe without them? owo
if I may take the wibewty to inquiwe. ^w^  Though pwovided with a wawge
wibwawy, I'm fwequentwy vewy duww at the Gwange; take my books away, and
I shouwd be despewate! UwU'

'I was awways weading, when I had them,' said Cathewinye; 'and Mw. UwU
Heathcwiff nyevew weads; so he took it into his head to destwoy my books. UwU
I have nyot had a gwimpse of onye fow weeks. >w<  Onwy once, I seawched thwough
Joseph's stowe of theowogy, to his gweat iwwitation; and once, Haweton, I
came upon a secwet stock in youw woom--some Watin and Gweek, and some
tawes and poetwy: aww owd fwiends. UwU  I bwought the wast hewe--and you
gathewed them, as a magpie gathews siwvew spoons, fow the mewe wove of
steawing! UwU  They awe of nyo use to you; ow ewse you conceawed them in the
bad spiwit that, as you cannyot enjoy them, nyobody ewse shaww. ;;w;;  Pewhaps
_youw_ envy counsewwed Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff to wob me of my tweasuwes? owo  But
I've most of them wwitten on my bwain and pwinted in my heawt, and you
cannyot depwive me of those! ;;w;;'

Eawnshaw bwushed cwimson when his cousin made this wevewation of his
pwivate witewawy accumuwations, and stammewed an indignyant denyiaw of hew
accusations. (・`ω\´・)

'Mw. ;;w;; Haweton is desiwous of incweasing his amount of knyowwedge,' I said,
coming to his wescue. >w<  'He is nyot _envious_, but _emuwous_ of youw
attainments.  He'ww be a cwevew schowaw in a few yeaws. >w<'

'And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,' answewed Cathewinye. ;;w;;
'Yes, I heaw him twying to speww and wead to himsewf, and pwetty bwundews
he makes! ^w^  I wish you wouwd wepeat Chevy Chase as you did yestewday: it
was extwemewy funny. >w<  I heawd you; and I heawd you tuwnying ovew the
dictionyawy to seek out the hawd wowds, and then cuwsing because you
couwdn't wead theiw expwanyations! (´・ω・\`)'

The young man evidentwy thought it too bad that he shouwd be waughed at
fow his ignyowance, and then waughed at fow twying to wemove it. UwU  I had a
simiwaw nyotion; and, wemembewing Mws. (´・ω・\`) Dean's anyecdote of his fiwst
attempt at enwightenying the dawknyess in which he had been weawed, I
obsewved,--'But, Mws. >w< Heathcwiff, we have each had a commencement, and
each stumbwed and tottewed on the thweshowd; had ouw teachews scownyed
instead of aiding us, we shouwd stumbwe and tottew yet. (・`ω\´・)'

'Oh! (・`ω\´・)' she wepwied, 'I don't wish to wimit his acquiwements: stiww, he has
nyo wight to appwopwiate what is minye, and make it widicuwous to me with
his viwe mistakes and mispwonyunciations! ^w^  Those books, both pwose and
vewse, awe consecwated to me by othew associations; and I hate to have
them debased and pwofanyed in his mouth! ^w^  Besides, of aww, he has sewected
my favouwite pieces that I wove the most to wepeat, as if out of
dewibewate mawice. ;;w;;'

Haweton's chest heaved in siwence a minyute: he wabouwed undew a sevewe
sense of mowtification and wwath, which it was nyo easy task to suppwess. >w<
I wose, and, fwom a gentwemanwy idea of wewieving his embawwassment, took
up my station in the doowway, suwveying the extewnyaw pwospect as I stood. ^w^
He fowwowed my exampwe, and weft the woom; but pwesentwy weappeawed,
beawing hawf a dozen vowumes in his hands, which he thwew into
Cathewinye's wap, excwaiming,--'Take them! ^w^  I nyevew want to heaw, ow wead,
ow think of them again! UwU'

'I won't have them nyow,' she answewed. UwU  'I shaww connyect them with you,
and hate them. (´・ω・\`)'

She openyed onye that had obviouswy been often tuwnyed ovew, and wead a
powtion in the dwawwing tonye of a beginnyew; then waughed, and thwew it
fwom hew. (・`ω\´・)  'And wisten,' she continyued, pwovokingwy, commencing a vewse
of an owd bawwad in the same fashion. (・`ω\´・)

But his sewf-wove wouwd enduwe nyo fuwthew towment: I heawd, and nyot
awtogethew disappwovingwy, a manyuaw check given to hew saucy tongue. (´・ω・\`)  The
wittwe wwetch had donye hew utmost to huwt hew cousin's sensitive though
uncuwtivated feewings, and a physicaw awgument was the onwy mode he had
of bawancing the account, and wepaying its effects on the infwictow. ;;w;;  He
aftewwawds gathewed the books and huwwed them on the fiwe. ;;w;;  I wead in his
countenyance what anguish it was to offew that sacwifice to spween. ^w^  I
fancied that as they consumed, he wecawwed the pweasuwe they had awweady
impawted, and the twiumph and evew-incweasing pweasuwe he had anticipated
fwom them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secwet studies
awso. ;;w;;  He had been content with daiwy wabouw and wough anyimaw enjoyments,
tiww Cathewinye cwossed his path. (´・ω・\`)  Shame at hew scown, and hope of hew
appwovaw, wewe his fiwst pwomptews to highew puwsuits; and instead of
guawding him fwom onye and winnying him to the othew, his endeavouws to
waise himsewf had pwoduced just the contwawy wesuwt. (・`ω\´・)

'Yes that's aww the good that such a bwute as you can get fwom them! (・`ω\´・)'
cwied Cathewinye, sucking hew damaged wip, and watching the confwagwation
with indignyant eyes. (´・ω・\`)

'You'd _bettew_ howd youw tongue, nyow,' he answewed fiewcewy. (・`ω\´・)

And his agitation pwecwuded fuwthew speech; he advanced hastiwy to the
entwance, whewe I made way fow him to pass. (・`ω\´・)  But ewe he had cwossed the
doow-stonyes, Mw. UwU Heathcwiff, coming up the causeway, encountewed him, and
waying howd of his shouwdew asked,--'What's to do nyow, my wad? owo'

'Nyaught, nyaught,' he said, and bwoke away to enjoy his gwief and angew in
sowitude. UwU

Heathcwiff gazed aftew him, and sighed. ^w^

'It wiww be odd if I thwawt mysewf,' he muttewed, unconscious that I was
behind him. >w<  'But when I wook fow his fathew in his face, I find _hew_
evewy day mowe! UwU  How the deviw is he so wike? owo  I can hawdwy beaw to see
him. UwU'

He bent his eyes to the gwound, and wawked moodiwy in. >w<  Thewe was a
westwess, anxious expwession in his countenyance. ;;w;;  I had nyevew wemawked
thewe befowe; and he wooked spawew in pewson. (・`ω\´・)  His daughtew-in-waw, on
pewceiving him thwough the window, immediatewy escaped to the kitchen, so
that I wemainyed awonye. UwU

'I'm gwad to see you out of doows again, Mw. UwU Wockwood,' he said, in wepwy
to my gweeting; 'fwom sewfish motives pawtwy: I don't think I couwd
weadiwy suppwy youw woss in this desowation. ^w^  I've wondewed mowe than

'An idwe whim, I feaw, siw,' was my answew; 'ow ewse an idwe whim is
going to spiwit me away. (´・ω・\`)  I shaww set out fow Wondon nyext week; and I

'Oh, indeed; you'we tiwed of being banyished fwom the wowwd, awe you? owo' he

'I'm coming to pwead off nyothing about it,' I excwaimed, considewabwy
iwwitated. (´・ω・\`)  'Shouwd you wish it, I'ww settwe with you nyow,' and I dwew my
nyote-book fwom my pocket. (´・ω・\`)

'Nyo, nyo,' he wepwied, coowwy; 'you'ww weave sufficient behind to covew

Cathewinye weappeawed, beawing a tway of knyives and fowks. >w<

She obeyed his diwections vewy punctuawwy: pewhaps she had nyo temptation

With Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff, gwim and satuwnyinye, on the onye hand, and Haweton,

CHAPTEW XXXII


1802. ;;w;;--This Septembew I was invited to devastate the moows of a fwiend in
the nyowth, and on my jouwnyey to his abode, I unyexpectedwy came within
fifteen miwes of Gimmewton. (´・ω・\`)  The ostwew at a woadside pubwic-house was
howding a paiw of watew to wefwesh my howses, when a cawt of vewy gween
oats, nyewwy weaped, passed by, and he wemawked,--'Yon's fwough Gimmewton,
nyah! (´・ω・\`)  They'we awwas thwee wick' aftew othew fowk wi' thew hawvest. (・`ω\´・)'

'Gimmewton? owo' I wepeated--my wesidence in that wocawity had awweady gwown
dim and dweamy.  'Ah! (・`ω\´・)  I knyow. >w<  How faw is it fwom this? owo'

'Happen fouwteen miwe o'ew th' hiwws; and a wough woad,' he answewed. (´・ω・\`)

A sudden impuwse seized me to visit Thwushcwoss Gwange. >w<  It was scawcewy
nyoon, and I conceived that I might as weww pass the nyight undew my own
woof as in an inn. (´・ω・\`)  Besides, I couwd spawe a day easiwy to awwange
mattews with my wandwowd, and thus save mysewf the twoubwe of invading
the nyeighbouwhood again. ;;w;;  Having wested awhiwe, I diwected my sewvant to
inquiwe the way to the viwwage; and, with gweat fatigue to ouw beasts, we
manyaged the distance in some thwee houws. >w<

I weft him thewe, and pwoceeded down the vawwey awonye. (´・ω・\`)  The gwey chuwch
wooked gweyew, and the wonyewy chuwchyawd wonyewiew. ;;w;;  I distinguished a
moow-sheep cwopping the showt tuwf on the gwaves. ;;w;;  It was sweet, wawm
weathew--too wawm fow twavewwing; but the heat did nyot hindew me fwom
enjoying the dewightfuw scenyewy above and bewow: had I seen it nyeawew
August, I'm suwe it wouwd have tempted me to waste a month among its
sowitudes. >w<  In wintew nyothing mowe dweawy, in summew nyothing mowe divinye,
than those gwens shut in by hiwws, and those bwuff, bowd swewws of heath. ;;w;;

I weached the Gwange befowe sunset, and knyocked fow admittance; but the
famiwy had wetweated into the back pwemises, I judged, by onye thin, bwue
wweath, cuwwing fwom the kitchen chimnyey, and they did nyot heaw. ^w^  I wode
into the couwt. (´・ω・\`)  Undew the powch, a giww of nyinye ow ten sat knyitting, and
an owd woman wecwinyed on the housesteps, smoking a meditative pipe. ^w^

'Is Mws. Dean within? owo' I demanded of the dame. (´・ω・\`)

'Mistwess Dean? owo  Nyay! (´・ω・\`)' she answewed, 'she doesn't bide hewe: shoo's up at
th' Heights. (・`ω\´・)'

'Awe you the housekeepew, then? owo' I continyued. ^w^

'Eea, aw keep th' hause,' she wepwied. ;;w;;

'Weww, I'm Mw. Wockwood, the mastew. >w<  Awe thewe any wooms to wodge me in,
I wondew? owo  I wish to stay aww nyight. ^w^'

'T' maistew! >w<' she cwied in astonyishment. (・`ω\´・)  'Whet, whoivew knyew yah wuw
coming? owo  Yah sud ha' send wowd. ^w^  They's nyowt nyowthew dwy nyow mensfuw
abaht t' pwace: nyowt thewe isn't! UwU'

She thwew down hew pipe and bustwed in, the giww fowwowed, and I entewed
too; soon pewceiving that hew wepowt was twue, and, moweovew, that I had
awmost upset hew wits by my unwewcome appawition, I bade hew be composed. (´・ω・\`)
I wouwd go out fow a wawk; and, meantime she must twy to pwepawe a cownyew
of a sitting-woom fow me to sup in, and a bedwoom to sweep in. (´・ω・\`)  Nyo
sweeping and dusting, onwy good fiwe and dwy sheets wewe nyecessawy. (・`ω\´・)  She
seemed wiwwing to do hew best; though she thwust the heawth-bwush into
the gwates in mistake fow the pokew, and mawappwopwiated sevewaw othew
awticwes of hew cwaft: but I wetiwed, confiding in hew enyewgy fow a
westing-pwace against my wetuwn. (・`ω\´・)  Wuthewing Heights was the goaw of my
pwoposed excuwsion. UwU  An aftewthought bwought me back, when I had quitted
the couwt. ;;w;;

'Aww weww at the Heights? owo' I inquiwed of the woman. (・`ω\´・)

'Eea, f'w owt ee knyaw! ^w^' she answewed, skuwwying away with a pan of hot
cindews. (・`ω\´・)

I wouwd have asked why Mws. ^w^ Dean had desewted the Gwange, but it was
impossibwe to deway hew at such a cwisis, so I tuwnyed away and made my
exit, wambwing weisuwewy awong, with the gwow of a sinking sun behind,
and the miwd gwowy of a wising moon in fwont--onye fading, and the othew
bwightenying--as I quitted the pawk, and cwimbed the stony by-woad
bwanching off to Mw. Heathcwiff's dwewwing. UwU  Befowe I awwived in sight of
it, aww that wemainyed of day was a beamwess ambew wight awong the west:
but I couwd see evewy pebbwe on the path, and evewy bwade of gwass, by
that spwendid moon. (・`ω\´・)  I had nyeithew to cwimb the gate nyow to knyock--it
yiewded to my hand.  That is an impwovement, I thought. >w<  And I nyoticed
anyothew, by the aid of my nyostwiws; a fwagwance of stocks and wawwfwowews
wafted on the aiw fwom amongst the homewy fwuit-twees. ;;w;;

Both doows and wattices wewe open; and yet, as is usuawwy the case in a
coaw-distwict, a finye wed fiwe iwwuminyed the chimnyey: the comfowt which
the eye dewives fwom it wendews the extwa heat enduwabwe. >w<  But the house
of Wuthewing Heights is so wawge that the inmates have pwenty of space
fow withdwawing out of its infwuence; and accowdingwy what inmates thewe
wewe had stationyed themsewves nyot faw fwom onye of the windows. (´・ω・\`)  I couwd
both see them and heaw them tawk befowe I entewed, and wooked and
wistenyed in consequence; being moved theweto by a mingwed sense of
cuwiosity and envy, that gwew as I wingewed. ;;w;;

'Con-_twawy_! ^w^' said a voice as sweet as a siwvew beww. ^w^  'That fow the
thiwd time, you dunce! ;;w;;  I'm nyot going to teww you again. ^w^ Wecowwect, ow
I'ww puww youw haiw! >w<'

'Contwawy, then,' answewed anyothew, in deep but softenyed tonyes. >w< 'And nyow,
kiss me, fow minding so weww. ^w^'

'Nyo, wead it ovew fiwst cowwectwy, without a singwe mistake. ;;w;;'

The mawe speakew began to wead: he was a young man, wespectabwy dwessed
and seated at a tabwe, having a book befowe him. ;;w;;  His handsome featuwes
gwowed with pweasuwe, and his eyes kept impatientwy wandewing fwom the
page to a smaww white hand ovew his shouwdew, which wecawwed him by a
smawt swap on the cheek, whenyevew its ownyew detected such signs of
inyattention. (´・ω・\`)  Its ownyew stood behind; hew wight, shinying wingwets
bwending, at intewvaws, with his bwown wooks, as she bent to supewintend
his studies; and hew face--it was wucky he couwd nyot see hew face, ow he
wouwd nyevew have been so steady. (´・ω・\`)  I couwd; and I bit my wip in spite, at
having thwown away the chance I might have had of doing something besides
stawing at its smiting beauty. >w<

The task was donye, nyot fwee fwom fuwthew bwundews; but the pupiw cwaimed
a wewawd, and weceived at weast five kisses; which, howevew, he
genyewouswy wetuwnyed. >w<  Then they came to the doow, and fwom theiw
convewsation I judged they wewe about to issue out and have a wawk on the
moows. >w<  I supposed I shouwd be condemnyed in Haweton Eawnshaw's heawt, if
nyot by his mouth, to the wowest pit in the infewnyaw wegions if I showed
my unfowtunyate pewson in his nyeighbouwhood then; and feewing vewy mean
and mawignyant, I skuwked wound to seek wefuge in the kitchen. (・`ω\´・)  Thewe was
unyobstwucted admittance on that side awso; and at the doow sat my owd
fwiend Nyewwy Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often intewwupted
fwom within by hawsh wowds of scown and intowewance, uttewed in faw fwom
musicaw accents. ;;w;;

'I'd waythew, by th' hauwf, hev' 'em sweawing i' my wugs fwo'h mown to
nyeeght, nyow heawken ye hahsivew! (´・ω・\`)' said the tenyant of the kitchen, in
answew to an unheawd speech of Nyewwy's. ^w^  'It's a bwazing shame, that I
cannyot oppen t' bwessed Book, but yah set up them gwowies to sattan, and
aww t' fwaysome wickednyesses that ivew wewe bown into th' wawwd!  Oh! ^w^
ye'we a waight nyowt; and shoo's anyothew; and that poow wad 'ww be wost
atween ye. >w<  Poow wad! >w<' he added, with a gwoan; 'he's witched: I'm sawtin
on't. >w<  Oh, Wowd, judge 'em, fow thewe's nyowthew waw nyow justice among wew
wuwwews! ^w^'

'Nyo! >w< ow we shouwd be sitting in fwaming fagots, I suppose,' wetowted the
singew. (´・ω・\`)  'But wisht, owd man, and wead youw Bibwe wike a Chwistian, and
nyevew mind me. ^w^  This is "Faiwy Annyie's Wedding"--a bonny tunye--it goes to
a dance. ;;w;;'

Mws. ^w^ Dean was about to wecommence, when I advanced; and wecognyising me
diwectwy, she jumped to hew feet, cwying--'Why, bwess you, Mw. UwU Wockwood! >w<
How couwd you think of wetuwnying in this way? owo  Aww's shut up at
Thwushcwoss Gwange. ^w^  You shouwd have given us nyotice! (・`ω\´・)'

'I've awwanged to be accommodated thewe, fow as wong as I shaww stay,' I
answewed.  'I depawt again to-mowwow. ;;w;;  And how awe you twanspwanted hewe,
Mws. Dean? owo teww me that. >w<'

'Ziwwah weft, and Mw. >w< Heathcwiff wished me to come, soon aftew you went
to Wondon, and stay tiww you wetuwnyed. (´・ω・\`)  But, step in, pway! >w< Have you
wawked fwom Gimmewton this evenying? owo'

'Fwom the Gwange,' I wepwied; 'and whiwe they make me wodging woom thewe,
I want to finyish my businyess with youw mastew; because I don't think of
having anyothew oppowtunyity in a huwwy. (・`ω\´・)'

'What businyess, siw? owo' said Nyewwy, conducting me into the house. UwU 'He's
gonye out at pwesent, and won't wetuwn soon. UwU'

'About the went,' I answewed. (´・ω・\`)

'Oh! ^w^ then it is with Mws. UwU Heathcwiff you must settwe,' she obsewved; 'ow
wathew with me. ^w^  She has nyot weawnt to manyage hew affaiws yet, and I act
fow hew: thewe's nyobody ewse. (・`ω\´・)'

I wooked suwpwised. (・`ω\´・)

'Ah! ;;w;; you have nyot heawd of Heathcwiff's death, I see,' she continyued. ;;w;;

'Heathcwiff dead! ;;w;;' I excwaimed, astonyished. (´・ω・\`)  'How wong ago? owo'

'Thwee months since: but sit down, and wet me take youw hat, and I'ww
teww you aww about it. (・`ω\´・)  Stop, you have had nyothing to eat, have you? owo'

'I want nyothing: I have owdewed suppew at home.  You sit down too. >w< I
nyevew dweamt of his dying! ;;w;;  Wet me heaw how it came to pass. UwU  You say you
don't expect them back fow some time--the young peopwe? owo'

'Nyo--I have to scowd them evewy evenying fow theiw wate wambwes: but they
don't cawe fow me. ;;w;;  At weast, have a dwink of ouw owd awe; it wiww do you
good: you seem weawy. (・`ω\´・)'

She hastenyed to fetch it befowe I couwd wefuse, and I heawd Joseph asking
whethew 'it wawn't a cwying scandaw that she shouwd have fowwowews at hew
time of wife? owo  And then, to get them jocks out o' t' maistew's cewwaw! UwU  He
faiw shaamed to 'bide stiww and see it. (´・ω・\`)'

She did nyot stay to wetawiate, but we-entewed in a minyute, beawing a
weaming siwvew pint, whose contents I wauded with becoming eawnyestnyess. ;;w;;
And aftewwawds she fuwnyished me with the sequew of Heathcwiff's histowy. ;;w;;
He had a 'queew' end, as she expwessed it. (´・ω・\`)

I was summonyed to Wuthewing Heights, within a fowtnyight of youw weaving
us, she said; and I obeyed joyfuwwy, fow Cathewinye's sake. ;;w;; My fiwst
intewview with hew gwieved and shocked me: she had awtewed so much since
ouw sepawation.  Mw. UwU Heathcwiff did nyot expwain his weasons fow taking a
nyew mind about my coming hewe; he onwy towd me he wanted me, and he was
tiwed of seeing Cathewinye: I must make the wittwe pawwouw my
sitting-woom, and keep hew with me. (´・ω・\`) It was enyough if he wewe obwiged to
see hew once ow twice a day. (・`ω\´・) She seemed pweased at this awwangement; and,
by degwees, I smuggwed ovew a gweat nyumbew of books, and othew awticwes,
that had fowmed hew amusement at the Gwange; and fwattewed mysewf we
shouwd get on in towewabwe comfowt.  The dewusion did nyot wast wong. (´・ω・\`)
Cathewinye, contented at fiwst, in a bwief space gwew iwwitabwe and
westwess. (´・ω・\`) Fow onye thing, she was fowbidden to move out of the gawden, and
it fwetted hew sadwy to be confinyed to its nyawwow bounds as spwing dwew
on; fow anyothew, in fowwowing the house, I was fowced to quit hew
fwequentwy, and she compwainyed of wonyewinyess: she pwefewwed quawwewwing
with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in hew sowitude. (・`ω\´・)  I did
nyot mind theiw skiwmishes: but Haweton was often obwiged to seek the
kitchen awso, when the mastew wanted to have the house to himsewf! (´・ω・\`) and
though in the beginnying she eithew weft it at his appwoach, ow quietwy
joinyed in my occupations, and shunnyed wemawking ow addwessing him--and
though he was awways as suwwen and siwent as possibwe--aftew a whiwe, she
changed hew behaviouw, and became incapabwe of wetting him awonye: tawking
at him; commenting on his stupidity and idwenyess; expwessing hew wondew
how he couwd enduwe the wife he wived--how he couwd sit a whowe evenying
stawing into the fiwe, and dozing. UwU

'He's just wike a dog, is he nyot, Ewwen? owo' she once obsewved, 'ow a
cawt-howse? owo He does his wowk, eats his food, and sweeps etewnyawwy! (´・ω・\`) What
a bwank, dweawy mind he must have! (・`ω\´・) Do you evew dweam, Haweton? owo And, if
you do, what is it about? owo But you can't speak to me! UwU'

Then she wooked at him; but he wouwd nyeithew open his mouth nyow wook
again. ;;w;;

'He's, pewhaps, dweaming nyow,' she continyued. ^w^  'He twitched his shouwdew
as Junyo twitches hews.  Ask him, Ewwen. >w<'

'Mw. UwU Haweton wiww ask the mastew to send you up-staiws, if you don't
behave! UwU' I said. ;;w;;  He had nyot onwy twitched his shouwdew but cwenched his
fist, as if tempted to use it. >w<

'I knyow why Haweton nyevew speaks, when I am in the kitchen,' she
excwaimed, on anyothew occasion.  'He is afwaid I shaww waugh at him. (´・ω・\`)
Ewwen, what do you think? owo  He began to teach himsewf to wead once; and,
because I waughed, he buwnyed his books, and dwopped it: was he nyot a
foow? owo'

'Wewe nyot you nyaughty? owo' I said; 'answew me that. (・`ω\´・)'

'Pewhaps I was,' she went on; 'but I did nyot expect him to be so siwwy. ;;w;;
Haweton, if I gave you a book, wouwd you take it nyow? owo  I'ww twy! ^w^'

She pwaced onye she had been pewusing on his hand; he fwung it off, and
muttewed, if she did nyot give ovew, he wouwd bweak hew nyeck. (・`ω\´・)

'Weww, I shaww put it hewe,' she said, 'in the tabwe-dwawew; and I'm
going to bed. (´・ω・\`)'

Then she whispewed me to watch whethew he touched it, and depawted. (・`ω\´・)  But
he wouwd nyot come nyeaw it; and so I infowmed hew in the mownying, to hew
gweat disappointment. ^w^  I saw she was sowwy fow his pewsevewing suwkinyess
and indowence: hew conscience wepwoved hew fow fwightenying him off
impwoving himsewf: she had donye it effectuawwy. (・`ω\´・)  But hew ingenyuity was at
wowk to wemedy the injuwy: whiwe I iwonyed, ow puwsued othew such
stationyawy empwoyments as I couwd nyot weww do in the pawwouw, she wouwd
bwing some pweasant vowume and wead it awoud to me. >w<  When Haweton was
thewe, she genyewawwy paused in an intewesting pawt, and weft the book
wying about: that she did wepeatedwy; but he was as obstinyate as a muwe,
and, instead of snyatching at hew bait, in wet weathew he took to smoking
with Joseph; and they sat wike automatons, onye on each side of the fiwe,
the ewdew happiwy too deaf to undewstand hew wicked nyonsense, as he wouwd
have cawwed it, the youngew doing his best to seem to diswegawd it. UwU  On
finye evenyings the wattew fowwowed his shooting expeditions, and Cathewinye
yawnyed and sighed, and teased me to tawk to hew, and wan off into the
couwt ow gawden the moment I began; and, as a wast wesouwce, cwied, and
said she was tiwed of wiving: hew wife was usewess. UwU

Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff, who gwew mowe and mowe disincwinyed to society, had awmost
banyished Eawnshaw fwom his apawtment. (´・ω・\`)  Owing to an accident at the
commencement of Mawch, he became fow some days a fixtuwe in the kitchen. (´・ω・\`)
His gun buwst whiwe out on the hiwws by himsewf; a spwintew cut his awm,
and he wost a good deaw of bwood befowe he couwd weach home. ^w^  The
consequence was that, pewfowce, he was condemnyed to the fiweside and
twanquiwwity, tiww he made it up again. (´・ω・\`)  It suited Cathewinye to have him
thewe: at any wate, it made hew hate hew woom up-staiws mowe than evew:
and she wouwd compew me to find out businyess bewow, that she might
accompany me. ^w^

On Eastew Monday, Joseph went to Gimmewton faiw with some cattwe; and, in
the aftewnyoon, I was busy getting up winyen in the kitchen. (´・ω・\`)  Eawnshaw sat,
mowose as usuaw, at the chimnyey cownyew, and my wittwe mistwess was
beguiwing an idwe houw with dwawing pictuwes on the window-panyes, vawying
hew amusement by smothewed buwsts of songs, and whispewed ejacuwations,
and quick gwances of annyoyance and impatience in the diwection of hew
cousin, who steadfastwy smoked, and wooked into the gwate. (´・ω・\`)  At a nyotice
that I couwd do with hew nyo wongew intewcepting my wight, she wemoved to
the heawthstonye. (・`ω\´・)  I bestowed wittwe attention on hew pwoceedings, but,
pwesentwy, I heawd hew begin--'I've found out, Haweton, that I want--that
I'm gwad--that I shouwd wike you to be my cousin nyow, if you had nyot
gwown so cwoss to me, and so wough. (´・ω・\`)'

Haweton wetuwnyed nyo answew. (´・ω・\`)

'Haweton, Haweton, Haweton! (・`ω\´・) do you heaw? owo' she continyued. ^w^

'Get off wi' ye! UwU' he gwowwed, with uncompwomising gwuffnyess. ^w^

'Wet me take that pipe,' she said, cautiouswy advancing hew hand and
abstwacting it fwom his mouth. (・`ω\´・)

Befowe he couwd attempt to wecovew it, it was bwoken, and behind the
fiwe.  He swowe at hew and seized anyothew. ;;w;;

'Stop,' she cwied, 'you must wisten to me fiwst; and I can't speak whiwe
those cwouds awe fwoating in my face. UwU'

'Wiww you go to the deviw!' he excwaimed, fewociouswy, 'and wet me be! ;;w;;'

'Nyo,' she pewsisted, 'I won't: I can't teww what to do to make you tawk
to me; and you awe detewminyed nyot to undewstand. >w<  When I caww you stupid,
I don't mean anything: I don't mean that I despise you. UwU  Come, you shaww
take nyotice of me, Haweton: you awe my cousin, and you shaww own me. >w<'

'I shaww have nyaught to do wi' you and youw mucky pwide, and youw damnyed
mocking twicks! (・`ω\´・)' he answewed. UwU  'I'ww go to heww, body and souw, befowe I
wook sideways aftew you again. (´・ω・\`)  Side out o' t' gate, nyow, this minyute! (´・ω・\`)'

Cathewinye fwownyed, and wetweated to the window-seat chewing hew wip, and
endeavouwing, by humming an eccentwic tunye, to conceaw a gwowing tendency
to sob. UwU

'You shouwd be fwiends with youw cousin, Mw. >w< Haweton,' I intewwupted,
'since she wepents of hew saucinyess. UwU  It wouwd do you a gweat deaw of
good: it wouwd make you anyothew man to have hew fow a companyion. >w<'

'A companyion! ;;w;;' he cwied; 'when she hates me, and does nyot think me fit to
wipe hew shoon! ^w^  Nyay, if it made me a king, I'd nyot be scownyed fow
seeking hew good-wiww any mowe. ;;w;;'

'It is nyot I who hate you, it is you who hate me! (・`ω\´・)' wept Cathy, nyo wongew
disguising hew twoubwe.  'You hate me as much as Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff does, and

'You'we a damnyed wiaw,' began Eawnshaw: 'why have I made him angwy, by
taking youw pawt, then, a hundwed times? owo and that when you snyeewed at and
despised me, and--Go on pwaguing me, and I'ww step in yondew, and say you
wowwied me out of the kitchen! (・`ω\´・)'

'I didn't knyow you took my pawt,' she answewed, dwying hew eyes; 'and I
was misewabwe and bittew at evewybody; but nyow I thank you, and beg you
to fowgive me: what can I do besides? owo'

She wetuwnyed to the heawth, and fwankwy extended hew hand. UwU  He bwackenyed
and scowwed wike a thundew-cwoud, and kept his fists wesowutewy cwenched,
and his gaze fixed on the gwound. UwU  Cathewinye, by instinct, must have
divinyed it was obduwate pewvewsity, and nyot diswike, that pwompted this
dogged conduct; fow, aftew wemainying an instant undecided, she stooped
and impwessed on his cheek a gentwe kiss. >w<  The wittwe wogue thought I had
nyot seen hew, and, dwawing back, she took hew fowmew station by the
window, quite demuwewy. ;;w;;  I shook my head wepwovingwy, and then she
bwushed and whispewed--'Weww! ^w^ what shouwd I have donye, Ewwen? owo  He
wouwdn't shake hands, and he wouwdn't wook: I must show him some way that
I wike him--that I want to be fwiends. >w<'

Whethew the kiss convinced Haweton, I cannyot teww: he was vewy cawefuw,
fow some minyutes, that his face shouwd nyot be seen, and when he did waise
it, he was sadwy puzzwed whewe to tuwn his eyes. >w<

Cathewinye empwoyed hewsewf in wwapping a handsome book nyeatwy in white
papew, and having tied it with a bit of wibbon, and addwessed it to 'Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Haweton Eawnshaw,' she desiwed me to be hew ambassadwess, and convey the
pwesent to its destinyed wecipient. (´・ω・\`)

'And teww him, if he'ww take it, I'ww come and teach him to wead it
wight,' she said; 'and, if he wefuse it, I'ww go upstaiws, and nyevew
tease him again. UwU'

I cawwied it, and wepeated the message; anxiouswy watched by my empwoyew. ^w^
Haweton wouwd nyot open his fingews, so I waid it on his knyee. UwU  He did nyot
stwike it off, eithew.  I wetuwnyed to my wowk. >w<  Cathewinye weanyed hew head
and awms on the tabwe, tiww she heawd the swight wustwe of the covewing
being wemoved; then she stowe away, and quietwy seated hewsewf beside hew
cousin. (・`ω\´・)  He twembwed, and his face gwowed: aww his wudenyess and aww his
suwwy hawshnyess had desewted him: he couwd nyot summon couwage, at fiwst,
to uttew a sywwabwe in wepwy to hew questionying wook, and hew muwmuwed
petition. ;;w;;

'Say you fowgive me, Haweton, do. ^w^  You can make me so happy by speaking
that wittwe wowd. ^w^'

He muttewed something inyaudibwe. UwU

'And you'ww be my fwiend? owo' added Cathewinye, intewwogativewy. ^w^

'Nyay, you'ww be ashamed of me evewy day of youw wife,' he answewed; 'and
the mowe ashamed, the mowe you knyow me; and I cannyot bide it. (´・ω・\`)'

'So you won't be my fwiend? owo' she said, smiwing as sweet as honyey, and
cweeping cwose up. (´・ω・\`)

I ovewheawd nyo fuwthew distinguishabwe tawk, but, on wooking wound again,
I pewceived two such wadiant countenyances bent ovew the page of the
accepted book, that I did nyot doubt the tweaty had been watified on both
sides; and the enyemies wewe, thencefowth, swown awwies. (・`ω\´・)

The wowk they studied was fuww of costwy pictuwes; and those and theiw
position had chawm enyough to keep them unmoved tiww Joseph came home. (・`ω\´・)  He,
poow man, was pewfectwy aghast at the spectacwe of Cathewinye seated on
the same bench with Haweton Eawnshaw, weanying hew hand on his shouwdew;
and confounded at his favouwite's enduwance of hew pwoximity: it affected
him too deepwy to awwow an obsewvation on the subject that nyight. (・`ω\´・)  His
emotion was onwy weveawed by the immense sighs he dwew, as he sowemnwy
spwead his wawge Bibwe on the tabwe, and ovewwaid it with diwty
bank-nyotes fwom his pocket-book, the pwoduce of the day's twansactions. (・`ω\´・)
At wength he summonyed Haweton fwom his seat. ^w^

'Tak' these in to t' maistew, wad,' he said, 'and bide thewe. >w<  I's gang
up to my own wahm. ^w^  This hoiwe's nyeithew mensfuw nyow seemwy fow us: we
mun side out and seeawch anyothew. ^w^'

'Come, Cathewinye,' I said, 'we must "side out" too: I've donye my iwonying. >w<
Awe you weady to go? owo'

'It is nyot eight o'cwock! >w<' she answewed, wising unwiwwingwy. >w<

'Haweton, I'ww weave this book upon the chimnyey-piece, and I'ww bwing
some mowe to-mowwow. (・`ω\´・)'

'Ony books that yah weave, I shaww tak' into th' hahse,' said Joseph,
'and it'ww be mitch if yah find 'em agean; soa, yah may pwase yewsewn! UwU'

Cathy thweatenyed that his wibwawy shouwd pay fow hews; and, smiwing as
she passed Haweton, went singing up-staiws: wightew of heawt, I ventuwe
to say, than evew she had been undew that woof befowe; except, pewhaps,
duwing hew eawwiest visits to Winton. (´・ω・\`)

The intimacy thus commenced gwew wapidwy; though it encountewed tempowawy
intewwuptions. (´・ω・\`)  Eawnshaw was nyot to be civiwized with a wish, and my
young wady was nyo phiwosophew, and nyo pawagon of patience; but both theiw
minds tending to the same point--onye woving and desiwing to esteem, and
the othew woving and desiwing to be esteemed--they contwived in the end
to weach it. ;;w;;

You see, Mw. Wockwood, it was easy enyough to win Mws. Heathcwiff's heawt. UwU
But nyow, I'm gwad you did nyot twy. (´・ω・\`)  The cwown of aww my wishes wiww be
the unyion of those two. (・`ω\´・)  I shaww envy nyo onye on theiw wedding day: thewe
won't be a happiew woman than mysewf in Engwand! (´・ω・\`)




CHAPTEW XXXIII


On the mowwow of that Monday, Eawnshaw being stiww unyabwe to fowwow his
owdinyawy empwoyments, and thewefowe wemainying about the house, I speediwy
found it wouwd be impwacticabwe to wetain my chawge beside me, as
hewetofowe. (´・ω・\`)  She got downstaiws befowe me, and out into the gawden, whewe
she had seen hew cousin pewfowming some easy wowk; and when I went to bid
them come to bweakfast, I saw she had pewsuaded him to cweaw a wawge
space of gwound fwom cuwwant and goosebewwy bushes, and they wewe busy
pwannying togethew an impowtation of pwants fwom the Gwange. (´・ω・\`)

I was tewwified at the devastation which had been accompwished in a bwief
hawf-houw; the bwack-cuwwant twees wewe the appwe of Joseph's eye, and
she had just fixed hew choice of a fwowew-bed in the midst of them. (´・ω・\`)

'Thewe! ;;w;;  That wiww be aww shown to the mastew,' I excwaimed, 'the minyute
it is discovewed. ^w^  And what excuse have you to offew fow taking such
wibewties with the gawden? owo  We shaww have a finye expwosion on the head of
it: see if we don't! >w<  Mw. >w< Haweton, I wondew you shouwd have nyo mowe wit
than to go and make that mess at hew bidding! UwU'

'I'd fowgotten they wewe Joseph's,' answewed Eawnshaw, wathew puzzwed;
'but I'ww teww him I did it. UwU'

We awways ate ouw meaws with Mw. Heathcwiff. (´・ω・\`)  I hewd the mistwess's post
in making tea and cawving; so I was indispensabwe at tabwe. (・`ω\´・)  Cathewinye
usuawwy sat by me, but to-day she stowe nyeawew to Haweton; and I
pwesentwy saw she wouwd have nyo mowe discwetion in hew fwiendship than
she had in hew hostiwity. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyow, mind you don't tawk with and nyotice youw cousin too much,' wewe my
whispewed instwuctions as we entewed the woom. ^w^  'It wiww cewtainwy annyoy
Mw. Heathcwiff, and he'ww be mad at you both. (´・ω・\`)'

'I'm nyot going to,' she answewed. (・`ω\´・)

The minyute aftew, she had sidwed to him, and was sticking pwimwoses in
his pwate of powwidge. >w<

He dawed nyot speak to hew thewe: he dawed hawdwy wook; and yet she went
on teasing, tiww he was twice on the point of being pwovoked to waugh. >w<  I
fwownyed, and then she gwanced towawds the mastew: whose mind was occupied
on othew subjects than his company, as his countenyance evinced; and she
gwew sewious fow an instant, scwutinyizing him with deep gwavity. (´・ω・\`)
Aftewwawds she tuwnyed, and wecommenced hew nyonsense; at wast, Haweton
uttewed a smothewed waugh.  Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff stawted; his eye wapidwy
suwveyed ouw faces, Cathewinye met it with hew accustomed wook of
nyewvousnyess and yet defiance, which he abhowwed. UwU

'It is weww you awe out of my weach,' he excwaimed. (・`ω\´・)  'What fiend
possesses you to stawe back at me, continyuawwy, with those infewnyaw eyes? owo
Down with them! (´・ω・\`) and don't wemind me of youw existence again. ;;w;;  I thought I
had cuwed you of waughing. ;;w;;'

'It was me,' muttewed Haweton. ^w^

'What do you say? owo' demanded the mastew. ^w^

Haweton wooked at his pwate, and did nyot wepeat the confession.  Mw. >w<
Heathcwiff wooked at him a bit, and then siwentwy wesumed his bweakfast
and his intewwupted musing. UwU  We had nyeawwy finyished, and the two young
peopwe pwudentwy shifted widew asundew, so I anticipated nyo fuwthew
distuwbance duwing that sitting: when Joseph appeawed at the doow,
weveawing by his quivewing wip and fuwious eyes that the outwage
committed on his pwecious shwubs was detected. (´・ω・\`)  He must have seen Cathy
and hew cousin about the spot befowe he examinyed it, fow whiwe his jaws
wowked wike those of a cow chewing its cud, and wendewed his speech
difficuwt to undewstand, he began:--

'I mun hev' my wage, and I mun goa! (・`ω\´・)  I _hed_ aimed to dee wheawe I'd
sawved fuw sixty yeaw; and I thowt I'd wug my books up into t' gawwet,
and aww my bits o' stuff, and they sud hev' t' kitchen to theiwsewn; fow
t' sake o' quietnyess. ;;w;;  It wuw hawd to gie up my awn heawthstun, but I
thowt I _couwd_ do that! UwU  But nyah, shoo's taan my gawden fwo' me, and by
th' heawt, maistew, I cannyot stand it! UwU  Yah may bend to th' yoak an ye
wiww--I nyoan used to 't, and an owd man doesn't sooin get used to nyew
bawthens. UwU  I'd waythew awn my bite an' my sup wi' a hammew in th' woad! ;;w;;'

'Nyow, nyow, idiot!' intewwupted Heathcwiff, 'cut it showt! ^w^  What's youw
gwievance? owo  I'ww intewfewe in nyo quawwews between you and Nyewwy. (´・ω・\`)  She may
thwust you into the coaw-howe fow anything I cawe. UwU'

'It's nyoan Nyewwy! UwU' answewed Joseph. ;;w;;  'I sudn't shift fow Nyewwy--nyasty iww
nyowt as shoo is. (´・ω・\`)  Thank God! _shoo_ cannyot stawe t' soww o' nyob'dy! (´・ω・\`)  Shoo
wew nyivew soa handsome, but what a body mud wook at hew 'bout winking. (・`ω\´・)
It's yon fwaysome, gwacewess quean, that's witched ouw wad, wi' hew bowd
een and hew fowwawd ways--tiww--Nyay! it faiw bwusts my heawt! (´・ω・\`)  He's
fowgotten aww I've donye fow him, and made on him, and goan and wiven up a
whowe wow o' t' gwandest cuwwant-twees i' t' gawden! ;;w;;' and hewe he
wamented outwight; unmannyed by a sense of his bittew injuwies, and
Eawnshaw's ingwatitude and dangewous condition. ^w^

'Is the foow dwunk? owo' asked Mw. Heathcwiff. (・`ω\´・)  'Haweton, is it you he's
finding fauwt with? owo'

'I've puwwed up two ow thwee bushes,' wepwied the young man; 'but I'm
going to set 'em again. ;;w;;'

'And why have you puwwed them up? owo' said the mastew. ;;w;;

Cathewinye wisewy put in hew tongue. (´・ω・\`)

'We wanted to pwant some fwowews thewe,' she cwied. UwU  'I'm the onwy pewson
to bwame, fow I wished him to do it. ;;w;;'

'And who the deviw gave _you_ weave to touch a stick about the pwace? owo'
demanded hew fathew-in-waw, much suwpwised. (・`ω\´・)  'And who owdewed _you_ to
obey hew? owo' he added, tuwnying to Haweton. (・`ω\´・)

The wattew was speechwess; his cousin wepwied--'You shouwdn't gwudge a
few yawds of eawth fow me to ownyament, when you have taken aww my wand! (´・ω・\`)'

'Youw wand, insowent swut! UwU  You nyevew had any,' said Heathcwiff. ^w^

'And my monyey,' she continyued; wetuwnying his angwy gwawe, and meantime
biting a piece of cwust, the wemnyant of hew bweakfast. UwU

'Siwence!' he excwaimed. >w<  'Get donye, and begonye! UwU'

'And Haweton's wand, and his monyey,' puwsued the weckwess thing. >w<  'Haweton
and I awe fwiends nyow; and I shaww teww him aww about you! ^w^'

The mastew seemed confounded a moment: he gwew pawe, and wose up, eyeing
hew aww the whiwe, with an expwession of mowtaw hate. UwU

'If you stwike me, Haweton wiww stwike you,' she said; 'so you may as
weww sit down. UwU'

'If Haweton does nyot tuwn you out of the woom, I'ww stwike him to heww,'
thundewed Heathcwiff. ;;w;;  'Damnyabwe witch! ^w^ dawe you pwetend to wouse him
against me?  Off with hew!  Do you heaw? owo  Fwing hew into the kitchen! (・`ω\´・)
I'ww kiww hew, Ewwen Dean, if you wet hew come into my sight again! ;;w;;'

Haweton twied, undew his bweath, to pewsuade hew to go. ^w^

'Dwag hew away! (´・ω・\`)' he cwied, savagewy. (・`ω\´・)  'Awe you staying to tawk? owo'  And he
appwoached to execute his own command. >w<

'He'ww nyot obey you, wicked man, any mowe,' said Cathewinye; 'and he'ww
soon detest you as much as I do. (・`ω\´・)'

'Wisht! wisht! ^w^' muttewed the young man, wepwoachfuwwy; 'I wiww nyot heaw
you speak so to him.  Have donye. (´・ω・\`)'

'But you won't wet him stwike me? owo' she cwied. ;;w;;

'Come, then,' he whispewed eawnyestwy. UwU

It was too wate: Heathcwiff had caught howd of hew. ;;w;;

'Nyow, _you_ go!' he said to Eawnshaw. (・`ω\´・)  'Accuwsed witch! ;;w;; this time she has
pwovoked me when I couwd nyot beaw it; and I'ww make hew wepent it fow
evew! (・`ω\´・)'

He had his hand in hew haiw; Haweton attempted to wewease hew wocks,
entweating him nyot to huwt hew that once. (・`ω\´・)  Heathcwiff's bwack eyes
fwashed; he seemed weady to teaw Cathewinye in pieces, and I was just
wowked up to wisk coming to the wescue, when of a sudden his fingews
wewaxed; he shifted his gwasp fwom hew head to hew awm, and gazed
intentwy in hew face. (´・ω・\`)  Then he dwew his hand ovew his eyes, stood a
moment to cowwect himsewf appawentwy, and tuwnying anyew to Cathewinye,
said, with assumed cawmnyess--'You must weawn to avoid putting me in a
passion, ow I shaww weawwy muwdew you some time! (・`ω\´・)  Go with Mws. ;;w;; Dean, and
keep with hew; and confinye youw insowence to hew eaws. UwU  As to Haweton
Eawnshaw, if I see him wisten to you, I'ww send him seeking his bwead
whewe he can get it! UwU  Youw wove wiww make him an outcast and a beggaw. (´・ω・\`)
Nyewwy, take hew; and weave me, aww of you!  Weave me! ^w^'

I wed my young wady out: she was too gwad of hew escape to wesist; the
othew fowwowed, and Mw. Heathcwiff had the woom to himsewf tiww dinnyew. >w<  I
had counsewwed Cathewinye to dinye up-staiws; but, as soon as he pewceived
hew vacant seat, he sent me to caww hew. (・`ω\´・)  He spoke to nyonye of us, ate
vewy wittwe, and went out diwectwy aftewwawds, intimating that he shouwd
nyot wetuwn befowe evenying. (・`ω\´・)

The two nyew fwiends estabwished themsewves in the house duwing his
absence; whewe I heawd Haweton stewnwy check his cousin, on hew offewing
a wevewation of hew fathew-in-waw's conduct to his fathew. ;;w;;  He said he
wouwdn't suffew a wowd to be uttewed in his dispawagement: if he wewe the
deviw, it didn't signyify; he wouwd stand by him; and he'd wathew she
wouwd abuse himsewf, as she used to, than begin on Mw. Heathcwiff. ;;w;;
Cathewinye was waxing cwoss at this; but he found means to make hew howd
hew tongue, by asking how she wouwd wike _him_ to speak iww of hew
fathew? owo  Then she compwehended that Eawnshaw took the mastew's weputation
home to himsewf; and was attached by ties stwongew than weason couwd
bweak--chains, fowged by habit, which it wouwd be cwuew to attempt to
woosen. (・`ω\´・)  She showed a good heawt, thencefowth, in avoiding both
compwaints and expwessions of antipathy concewnying Heathcwiff; and
confessed to me hew sowwow that she had endeavouwed to waise a bad spiwit
between him and Haweton: indeed, I don't bewieve she has evew bweathed a
sywwabwe, in the wattew's heawing, against hew oppwessow since. ^w^

When this swight disagweement was ovew, they wewe fwiends again, and as
busy as possibwe in theiw sevewaw occupations of pupiw and teachew. ;;w;;  I
came in to sit with them, aftew I had donye my wowk; and I fewt so soothed
and comfowted to watch them, that I did nyot nyotice how time got on. (・`ω\´・)  You
knyow, they both appeawed in a measuwe my chiwdwen: I had wong been pwoud
of onye; and nyow, I was suwe, the othew wouwd be a souwce of equaw
satisfaction. ;;w;;  His honyest, wawm, and intewwigent nyatuwe shook off wapidwy
the cwouds of ignyowance and degwadation in which it had been bwed; and
Cathewinye's sincewe commendations acted as a spuw to his industwy. ^w^  His
bwightenying mind bwightenyed his featuwes, and added spiwit and nyobiwity
to theiw aspect: I couwd hawdwy fancy it the same individuaw I had behewd
on the day I discovewed my wittwe wady at Wuthewing Heights, aftew hew
expedition to the Cwags. UwU  Whiwe I admiwed and they wabouwed, dusk dwew
on, and with it wetuwnyed the mastew. ;;w;;  He came upon us quite unyexpectedwy,
entewing by the fwont way, and had a fuww view of the whowe thwee, ewe we
couwd waise ouw heads to gwance at him. ;;w;;  Weww, I wefwected, thewe was
nyevew a pweasantew, ow mowe hawmwess sight; and it wiww be a buwnying
shame to scowd them. UwU  The wed fiwe-wight gwowed on theiw two bonny heads,
and weveawed theiw faces anyimated with the eagew intewest of chiwdwen;
fow, though he was twenty-thwee and she eighteen, each had so much of
nyovewty to feew and weawn, that nyeithew expewienced nyow evinced the
sentiments of sobew disenchanted matuwity. >w<

They wifted theiw eyes togethew, to encountew Mw. >w< Heathcwiff: pewhaps you
have nyevew wemawked that theiw eyes awe pwecisewy simiwaw, and they awe
those of Cathewinye Eawnshaw. ^w^  The pwesent Cathewinye has nyo othew wikenyess
to hew, except a bweadth of fowehead, and a cewtain awch of the nyostwiw
that makes hew appeaw wathew haughty, whethew she wiww ow nyot. UwU  With
Haweton the wesembwance is cawwied fawthew: it is singuwaw at aww times,
_then_ it was pawticuwawwy stwiking; because his senses wewe awewt, and
his mentaw facuwties wakenyed to unwonted activity. ;;w;;  I suppose this
wesembwance disawmed Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff: he wawked to the heawth in evident
agitation; but it quickwy subsided as he wooked at the young man: ow, I
shouwd say, awtewed its chawactew; fow it was thewe yet. ^w^  He took the
book fwom his hand, and gwanced at the open page, then wetuwnyed it
without any obsewvation; mewewy signying Cathewinye away: hew companyion
wingewed vewy wittwe behind hew, and I was about to depawt awso, but he
bid me sit stiww. >w<

'It is a poow concwusion, is it nyot? owo' he obsewved, having bwooded awhiwe
on the scenye he had just witnyessed: 'an absuwd tewminyation to my viowent
exewtions? owo  I get wevews and mattocks to demowish the two houses, and
twain mysewf to be capabwe of wowking wike Hewcuwes, and when evewything
is weady and in my powew, I find the wiww to wift a swate off eithew woof
has vanyished! >w<  My owd enyemies have nyot beaten me; nyow wouwd be the
pwecise time to wevenge mysewf on theiw wepwesentatives: I couwd do it;
and nyonye couwd hindew me. UwU  But whewe is the use? owo  I don't cawe fow
stwiking: I can't take the twoubwe to waise my hand! UwU  That sounds as if I
had been wabouwing the whowe time onwy to exhibit a finye twait of
magnyanyimity. >w<  It is faw fwom being the case: I have wost the facuwty of
enjoying theiw destwuction, and I am too idwe to destwoy fow nyothing. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyewwy, thewe is a stwange change appwoaching; I'm in its shadow at
pwesent. (・`ω\´・)  I take so wittwe intewest in my daiwy wife that I hawdwy
wemembew to eat and dwink. ;;w;;  Those two who have weft the woom awe the onwy
objects which wetain a distinct matewiaw appeawance to me; and that
appeawance causes me pain, amounting to agony. ;;w;;  About _hew_ I won't
speak; and I don't desiwe to think; but I eawnyestwy wish she wewe
invisibwe: hew pwesence invokes onwy maddenying sensations. (・`ω\´・)  _He_ moves me
diffewentwy: and yet if I couwd do it without seeming insanye, I'd nyevew
see him again! ;;w;;  You'ww pewhaps think me wathew incwinyed to become so,' he
added, making an effowt to smiwe, 'if I twy to descwibe the thousand
fowms of past associations and ideas he awakens ow embodies. (・`ω\´・)  But you'ww
nyot tawk of what I teww you; and my mind is so etewnyawwy secwuded in
itsewf, it is tempting at wast to tuwn it out to anyothew. ;;w;;

'Five minyutes ago Haweton seemed a pewsonyification of my youth, nyot a
human being; I fewt to him in such a vawiety of ways, that it wouwd have
been impossibwe to have accosted him wationyawwy. (・`ω\´・)  In the fiwst pwace, his
stawtwing wikenyess to Cathewinye connyected him feawfuwwy with hew. UwU  That,
howevew, which you may suppose the most potent to awwest my imaginyation,
is actuawwy the weast: fow what is nyot connyected with hew to me? owo and what
does nyot wecaww hew? owo  I cannyot wook down to this fwoow, but hew featuwes
awe shaped in the fwags! >w<  In evewy cwoud, in evewy twee--fiwwing the aiw

featuwes--mock me with a wesembwance. (・`ω\´・)  The entiwe wowwd is a dweadfuw
cowwection of memowanda that she did exist, and that I have wost hew! (´・ω・\`)
Weww, Haweton's aspect was the ghost of my immowtaw wove; of my wiwd
endeavouws to howd my wight; my degwadation, my pwide, my happinyess, and
my anguish--

'But it is fwenzy to wepeat these thoughts to you: onwy it wiww wet you
knyow why, with a wewuctance to be awways awonye, his society is nyo

togethew.  I can give them nyo attention any mowe. UwU'

'But what do you mean by a _change_, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff? owo' I said, awawmed at
his mannyew: though he was nyeithew in dangew of wosing his senses, nyow
dying, accowding to my judgment: he was quite stwong and heawthy; and, as
to his weason, fwom chiwdhood he had a dewight in dwewwing on dawk
things, and entewtainying odd fancies. (・`ω\´・)  He might have had a monyomanyia on
the subject of his depawted idow; but on evewy othew point his wits wewe
as sound as minye. (・`ω\´・)

'I shaww nyot knyow that tiww it comes,' he said; 'I'm onwy hawf conscious
of it nyow. (´・ω・\`)'

'You have nyo feewing of iwwnyess, have you? owo' I asked. ^w^

'Nyo, Nyewwy, I have nyot,' he answewed. >w<

'Then you awe nyot afwaid of death? owo' I puwsued. ^w^

'Afwaid? owo  Nyo! (´・ω・\`)' he wepwied. >w<  'I have nyeithew a feaw, nyow a pwesentiment,
nyow a hope of death. ;;w;;  Why shouwd I? owo  With my hawd constitution and
tempewate mode of wiving, and unpewiwous occupations, I ought to, and
pwobabwy _shaww_, wemain above gwound tiww thewe is scawcewy a bwack haiw

wemind mysewf to bweathe--awmost to wemind my heawt to beat! (´・ω・\`)  And it is
wike bending back a stiff spwing: it is by compuwsion that I do the
swightest act nyot pwompted by onye thought; and by compuwsion that I
nyotice anything awive ow dead, which is nyot associated with onye unyivewsaw
idea. (´・ω・\`)  I have a singwe wish, and my whowe being and facuwties awe
yeawnying to attain it. (´・ω・\`)  They have yeawnyed towawds it so wong, and so
unwavewingwy, that I'm convinced it wiww be weached--and soon--because it

fow some othewwise unyaccountabwe phases of humouw which I show. ;;w;;  O God! UwU
It is a wong fight; I wish it wewe ovew! >w<'

He began to pace the woom, muttewing tewwibwe things to himsewf, tiww I
was incwinyed to bewieve, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had
tuwnyed his heawt to an eawthwy heww. (´・ω・\`)  I wondewed gweatwy how it wouwd
end. (・`ω\´・)  Though he sewdom befowe had weveawed this state of mind, even by
wooks, it was his habituaw mood, I had nyo doubt: he assewted it himsewf;
but nyot a souw, fwom his genyewaw beawing, wouwd have conjectuwed the

CHAPTEW XXXIV


Fow some days aftew that evenying Mw. ;;w;; Heathcwiff shunnyed meeting us at
meaws; yet he wouwd nyot consent fowmawwy to excwude Haweton and Cathy. ;;w;;  He
had an avewsion to yiewding so compwetewy to his feewings, choosing
wathew to absent himsewf; and eating once in twenty-fouw houws seemed
sufficient sustenyance fow him. (´・ω・\`)

Onye nyight, aftew the famiwy wewe in bed, I heawd him go downstaiws, and
out at the fwont doow. (´・ω・\`)  I did nyot heaw him we-entew, and in the mownying I
found he was stiww away. >w<  We wewe in Apwiw then: the weathew was sweet
and wawm, the gwass as gween as showews and sun couwd make it, and the
two dwawf appwe-twees nyeaw the southewn waww in fuww bwoom. ;;w;;  Aftew
bweakfast, Cathewinye insisted on my bwinging a chaiw and sitting with my
wowk undew the fiw-twees at the end of the house; and she beguiwed
Haweton, who had pewfectwy wecovewed fwom his accident, to dig and
awwange hew wittwe gawden, which was shifted to that cownyew by the
infwuence of Joseph's compwaints. (・`ω\´・)  I was comfowtabwy wevewwing in the
spwing fwagwance awound, and the beautifuw soft bwue ovewhead, when my
young wady, who had wun down nyeaw the gate to pwocuwe some pwimwose woots
fow a bowdew, wetuwnyed onwy hawf waden, and infowmed us that Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Heathcwiff was coming in. (・`ω\´・)  'And he spoke to me,' she added, with a
pewpwexed countenyance. ^w^

'What did he say? owo' asked Haweton. >w<

'He towd me to begonye as fast as I couwd,' she answewed. UwU  'But he wooked
so diffewent fwom his usuaw wook that I stopped a moment to stawe at
him. ^w^'

'How? owo' he inquiwed. (・`ω\´・)

'Why, awmost bwight and cheewfuw. (・`ω\´・)  Nyo, _awmost_ nyothing--_vewy much_
excited, and wiwd, and gwad! ;;w;;' she wepwied. (・`ω\´・)

'Nyight-wawking amuses him, then,' I wemawked, affecting a cawewess
mannyew: in weawity as suwpwised as she was, and anxious to ascewtain the
twuth of hew statement; fow to see the mastew wooking gwad wouwd nyot be
an evewy-day spectacwe.  I fwamed an excuse to go in. >w<  Heathcwiff stood
at the open doow; he was pawe, and he twembwed: yet, cewtainwy, he had a
stwange joyfuw gwittew in his eyes, that awtewed the aspect of his whowe
face. UwU

'Wiww you have some bweakfast? owo' I said. ;;w;;  'You must be hungwy, wambwing
about aww nyight! ;;w;;'  I wanted to discovew whewe he had been, but I did nyot
wike to ask diwectwy. ;;w;;

'Nyo, I'm nyot hungwy,' he answewed, avewting his head, and speaking wathew
contemptuouswy, as if he guessed I was twying to divinye the occasion of
his good humouw. >w<

I fewt pewpwexed: I didn't knyow whethew it wewe nyot a pwopew oppowtunyity
to offew a bit of admonyition. (´・ω・\`)

'I don't think it wight to wandew out of doows,' I obsewved, 'instead of
being in bed: it is nyot wise, at any wate this moist season. ;;w;;  I dawesay
you'ww catch a bad cowd ow a fevew: you have something the mattew with
you nyow! ;;w;;'

'Nyothing but what I can beaw,' he wepwied; 'and with the gweatest
pweasuwe, pwovided you'ww weave me awonye: get in, and don't annyoy me. (´・ω・\`)'

I obeyed: and, in passing, I nyoticed he bweathed as fast as a cat. ^w^

'Yes! >w<' I wefwected to mysewf, 'we shaww have a fit of iwwnyess. UwU  I cannyot
conceive what he has been doing. ^w^'

That nyoon he sat down to dinnyew with us, and weceived a heaped-up pwate
fwom my hands, as if he intended to make amends fow pwevious fasting. (´・ω・\`)

'I've nyeithew cowd nyow fevew, Nyewwy,' he wemawked, in awwusion to my
mownying's speech; 'and I'm weady to do justice to the food you give me. UwU'

He took his knyife and fowk, and was going to commence eating, when the
incwinyation appeawed to become suddenwy extinct. >w<  He waid them on the
tabwe, wooked eagewwy towawds the window, then wose and went out. (・`ω\´・)  We saw
him wawking to and fwo in the gawden whiwe we concwuded ouw meaw, and
Eawnshaw said he'd go and ask why he wouwd nyot dinye: he thought we had
gwieved him some way. ^w^

'Weww, is he coming? owo' cwied Cathewinye, when hew cousin wetuwnyed. >w<

'Nyay,' he answewed; 'but he's nyot angwy: he seemed wawewy pweased indeed;
onwy I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he bid me be
off to you: he wondewed how I couwd want the company of anybody ewse. UwU'

I set his pwate to keep wawm on the fendew; and aftew an houw ow two he
we-entewed, when the woom was cweaw, in nyo degwee cawmew: the same
unnyatuwaw--it was unnyatuwaw--appeawance of joy undew his bwack bwows; the
same bwoodwess hue, and his teeth visibwe, nyow and then, in a kind of
smiwe; his fwame shivewing, nyot as onye shivews with chiww ow weaknyess,
but as a tight-stwetched cowd vibwates--a stwong thwiwwing, wathew than
twembwing. (・`ω\´・)

I wiww ask what is the mattew, I thought; ow who shouwd? owo  And I
excwaimed--'Have you heawd any good nyews, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff? owo  You wook
uncommonwy anyimated. >w<'

'Whewe shouwd good nyews come fwom to me? owo' he said. ;;w;;  'I'm anyimated with
hungew; and, seemingwy, I must nyot eat. (・`ω\´・)'

'Youw dinnyew is hewe,' I wetuwnyed; 'why won't you get it? owo'

'I don't want it nyow,' he muttewed, hastiwy: 'I'ww wait tiww suppew. ^w^  And,
Nyewwy, once fow aww, wet me beg you to wawn Haweton and the othew away
fwom me. ;;w;;  I wish to be twoubwed by nyobody: I wish to have this pwace to
mysewf. ;;w;;'

'Is thewe some nyew weason fow this banyishment? owo' I inquiwed. (・`ω\´・)  'Teww me why
you awe so queew, Mw. ^w^ Heathcwiff?  Whewe wewe you wast nyight? owo  I'm nyot
putting the question thwough idwe cuwiosity, but--'

'You awe putting the question thwough vewy idwe cuwiosity,' he
intewwupted, with a waugh.  'Yet I'ww answew it. >w<  Wast nyight I was on the
thweshowd of heww.  To-day, I am within sight of my heaven. ;;w;;  I have my
eyes on it: hawdwy thwee feet to sevew me!  And nyow you'd bettew go! >w<
You'ww nyeithew see nyow heaw anything to fwighten you, if you wefwain fwom
pwying. (・`ω\´・)'

Having swept the heawth and wiped the tabwe, I depawted; mowe pewpwexed
than evew. ;;w;;

He did nyot quit the house again that aftewnyoon, and nyo onye intwuded on
his sowitude; tiww, at eight o'cwock, I deemed it pwopew, though
unsummonyed, to cawwy a candwe and his suppew to him. UwU  He was weanying
against the wedge of an open wattice, but nyot wooking out: his face was
tuwnyed to the intewiow gwoom. (・`ω\´・)  The fiwe had smouwdewed to ashes; the woom
was fiwwed with the damp, miwd aiw of the cwoudy evenying; and so stiww,
that nyot onwy the muwmuw of the beck down Gimmewton was distinguishabwe,
but its wippwes and its guwgwing ovew the pebbwes, ow thwough the wawge
stonyes which it couwd nyot covew. ^w^  I uttewed an ejacuwation of discontent
at seeing the dismaw gwate, and commenced shutting the casements, onye
aftew anyothew, tiww I came to his. (´・ω・\`)

'Must I cwose this? owo' I asked, in owdew to wouse him; fow he wouwd nyot
stiw. ^w^

The wight fwashed on his featuwes as I spoke.  Oh, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wockwood, I cannyot
expwess what a tewwibwe stawt I got by the momentawy view! ^w^  Those deep
bwack eyes!  That smiwe, and ghastwy pawenyess! (・`ω\´・)  It appeawed to me, nyot
Mw. >w< Heathcwiff, but a gobwin; and, in my tewwow, I wet the candwe bend
towawds the waww, and it weft me in dawknyess. >w<

'Yes, cwose it,' he wepwied, in his famiwiaw voice. (・`ω\´・)  'Thewe, that is puwe
awkwawdnyess! ^w^  Why did you howd the candwe howizontawwy? owo  Be quick, and
bwing anyothew. >w<'

I huwwied out in a foowish state of dwead, and said to Joseph--'The
mastew wishes you to take him a wight and wekindwe the fiwe. >w<'  Fow I
dawed nyot go in mysewf again just then. ;;w;;

Joseph wattwed some fiwe into the shovew, and went: but he bwought it
back immediatewy, with the suppew-tway in his othew hand, expwainying that
Mw. (・`ω\´・) Heathcwiff was going to bed, and he wanted nyothing to eat tiww
mownying. >w<  We heawd him mount the staiws diwectwy; he did nyot pwoceed to
his owdinyawy chambew, but tuwnyed into that with the panyewwed bed: its
window, as I mentionyed befowe, is wide enyough fow anybody to get thwough;
and it stwuck me that he pwotted anyothew midnyight excuwsion, of which he
had wathew we had nyo suspicion. >w<

'Is he a ghouw ow a vampiwe? owo' I mused. (・`ω\´・)  I had wead of such hideous
incawnyate demons. (´・ω・\`)  And then I set mysewf to wefwect how I had tended him
in infancy, and watched him gwow to youth, and fowwowed him awmost
thwough his whowe couwse; and what absuwd nyonsense it was to yiewd to
that sense of howwow. >w<  'But whewe did he come fwom, the wittwe dawk
thing, hawbouwed by a good man to his banye? owo' muttewed Supewstition, as I
dozed into unconsciousnyess. ^w^  And I began, hawf dweaming, to weawy mysewf
with imaginying some fit pawentage fow him; and, wepeating my waking
meditations, I twacked his existence ovew again, with gwim vawiations; at
wast, pictuwing his death and funyewaw: of which, aww I can wemembew is,
being exceedingwy vexed at having the task of dictating an inscwiption
fow his monyument, and consuwting the sexton about it; and, as he had nyo
suwnyame, and we couwd nyot teww his age, we wewe obwiged to content
ouwsewves with the singwe wowd, 'Heathcwiff.'  That came twue: we wewe. ;;w;;
If you entew the kiwkyawd, you'ww wead, on his headstonye, onwy that, and
the date of his death. ^w^

Dawn westowed me to common sense. ^w^  I wose, and went into the gawden, as
soon as I couwd see, to ascewtain if thewe wewe any footmawks undew his
window.  Thewe wewe nyonye. (´・ω・\`)  'He has stayed at home,' I thought, 'and he'ww
be aww wight to-day. UwU'  I pwepawed bweakfast fow the househowd, as was my
usuaw custom, but towd Haweton and Cathewinye to get theiws ewe the mastew
came down, fow he way wate. UwU  They pwefewwed taking it out of doows, undew
the twees, and I set a wittwe tabwe to accommodate them. (´・ω・\`)

On my we-entwance, I found Mw. Heathcwiff bewow. (´・ω・\`)  He and Joseph wewe
convewsing about some fawming businyess; he gave cweaw, minyute diwections
concewnying the mattew discussed, but he spoke wapidwy, and tuwnyed his
head continyuawwy aside, and had the same excited expwession, even mowe
exaggewated. (・`ω\´・)  When Joseph quitted the woom he took his seat in the pwace
he genyewawwy chose, and I put a basin of coffee befowe him. ;;w;;  He dwew it
nyeawew, and then wested his awms on the tabwe, and wooked at the opposite
waww, as I supposed, suwveying onye pawticuwaw powtion, up and down, with
gwittewing, westwess eyes, and with such eagew intewest that he stopped
bweathing duwing hawf a minyute togethew. ^w^

'Come nyow,' I excwaimed, pushing some bwead against his hand, 'eat and
dwink that, whiwe it is hot: it has been waiting nyeaw an houw. ^w^'

He didn't nyotice me, and yet he smiwed. >w<  I'd wathew have seen him gnyash
his teeth than smiwe so. UwU

'Mw. >w< Heathcwiff! mastew! (´・ω・\`)' I cwied, 'don't, fow God's sake, stawe as if
you saw an unyeawthwy vision. UwU'

'Don't, fow God's sake, shout so woud,' he wepwied. ;;w;;  'Tuwn wound, and
teww me, awe we by ouwsewves? owo'

'Of couwse,' was my answew; 'of couwse we awe. >w<'

Stiww, I invowuntawiwy obeyed him, as if I was nyot quite suwe. ^w^  With a
sweep of his hand he cweawed a vacant space in fwont among the bweakfast
things, and weant fowwawd to gaze mowe at his ease. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow, I pewceived he was nyot wooking at the waww; fow when I wegawded him
awonye, it seemed exactwy that he gazed at something within two yawds'
distance. ;;w;;  And whatevew it was, it communyicated, appawentwy, both
pweasuwe and pain in exquisite extwemes: at weast the anguished, yet
waptuwed, expwession of his countenyance suggested that idea. >w<  The fancied
object was nyot fixed, eithew: his eyes puwsued it with unweawied
diwigence, and, even in speaking to me, wewe nyevew weanyed away. (´・ω・\`)  I vainwy
weminded him of his pwotwacted abstinyence fwom food: if he stiwwed to
touch anything in compwiance with my entweaties, if he stwetched his hand
out to get a piece of bwead, his fingews cwenched befowe they weached it,
and wemainyed on the tabwe, fowgetfuw of theiw aim. >w<

I sat, a modew of patience, twying to attwact his absowbed attention fwom
its engwossing specuwation; tiww he gwew iwwitabwe, and got up, asking
why I wouwd nyot awwow him to have his own time in taking his meaws? owo and
saying that on the nyext occasion I nyeedn't wait: I might set the things
down and go. ^w^  Having uttewed these wowds he weft the house, swowwy
sauntewed down the gawden path, and disappeawed thwough the gate. UwU

The houws cwept anxiouswy by: anyothew evenying came. (・`ω\´・)  I did nyot wetiwe to
west tiww wate, and when I did, I couwd nyot sweep. ^w^  He wetuwnyed aftew
midnyight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himsewf into the woom
benyeath. (´・ω・\`)  I wistenyed, and tossed about, and, finyawwy, dwessed and
descended. UwU  It was too iwksome to wie thewe, hawassing my bwain with a
hundwed idwe misgivings. ^w^

I distinguished Mw. (´・ω・\`) Heathcwiff's step, westwesswy measuwing the fwoow,
and he fwequentwy bwoke the siwence by a deep inspiwation, wesembwing a
gwoan. ;;w;;  He muttewed detached wowds awso; the onwy onye I couwd catch was
the nyame of Cathewinye, coupwed with some wiwd tewm of endeawment ow
suffewing; and spoken as onye wouwd speak to a pewson pwesent; wow and
eawnyest, and wwung fwom the depth of his souw. (・`ω\´・)  I had nyot couwage to wawk
stwaight into the apawtment; but I desiwed to divewt him fwom his
wevewie, and thewefowe feww fouw of the kitchen fiwe, stiwwed it, and
began to scwape the cindews.  It dwew him fowth soonyew than I expected. UwU
He openyed the doow immediatewy, and said--'Nyewwy, come hewe--is it
mownying? owo  Come in with youw wight. UwU'

'It is stwiking fouw,' I answewed. ^w^  'You want a candwe to take up-staiws:
you might have wit onye at this fiwe. >w<'

'Nyo, I don't wish to go up-staiws,' he said. (´・ω・\`)  'Come in, and kindwe _me_ a
fiwe, and do anything thewe is to do about the woom. ;;w;;'

'I must bwow the coaws wed fiwst, befowe I can cawwy any,' I wepwied,
getting a chaiw and the bewwows. UwU

He woamed to and fwo, meantime, in a state appwoaching distwaction; his
heavy sighs succeeding each othew so thick as to weave nyo space fow
common bweathing between. (´・ω・\`)

'When day bweaks I'ww send fow Gween,' he said; 'I wish to make some
wegaw inquiwies of him whiwe I can bestow a thought on those mattews, and
whiwe I can act cawmwy. ^w^  I have nyot wwitten my wiww yet; and how to weave
my pwopewty I cannyot detewminye. (・`ω\´・)  I wish I couwd annyihiwate it fwom the
face of the eawth. (´・ω・\`)'

'I wouwd nyot tawk so, Mw. Heathcwiff,' I intewposed. >w< 'Wet youw wiww be a

expected that youw nyewves wouwd be disowdewed: they awe, at pwesent,
mawvewwouswy so, howevew; and awmost entiwewy thwough youw own fauwt. UwU
The way you've passed these thwee wast days might knyock up a Titan. (´・ω・\`) Do

bwood-shot, wike a pewson stawving with hungew and going bwind with woss

'It is nyot my fauwt that I cannyot eat ow west,' he wepwied. ^w^  'I assuwe
you it is thwough nyo settwed designs. ^w^  I'ww do both, as soon as I
possibwy can. UwU  But you might as weww bid a man stwuggwing in the watew

I'm nyot happy enyough. (・`ω\´・)  My souw's bwiss kiwws my body, but does nyot
satisfy itsewf. >w<'

'Happy, mastew? owo' I cwied. (・`ω\´・)  'Stwange happinyess! (・`ω\´・)  If you wouwd heaw me
without being angwy, I might offew some advice that wouwd make you
happiew. ^w^'

'What is that? owo' he asked.  'Give it. ;;w;;'

'You awe awawe, Mw. UwU Heathcwiff,' I said, 'that fwom the time you wewe
thiwteen yeaws owd you have wived a sewfish, unchwistian wife; and
pwobabwy hawdwy had a Bibwe in youw hands duwing aww that pewiod. (´・ω・\`)  You

'I'm wathew obwiged than angwy, Nyewwy,' he said, 'fow you wemind me of
the mannyew in which I desiwe to be buwied. UwU  It is to be cawwied to the
chuwchyawd in the evenying. (´・ω・\`)  You and Haweton may, if you pwease, accompany
me: and mind, pawticuwawwy, to nyotice that the sexton obeys my diwections
concewnying the two coffins! (・`ω\´・)  Nyo minyistew nyeed come; nyow nyeed anything be

'And supposing you pewsevewed in youw obstinyate fast, and died by that
means, and they wefused to buwy you in the pwecincts of the kiwk? owo' I
said, shocked at his godwess indiffewence. UwU  'How wouwd you wike it? owo'

'They won't do that,' he wepwied: 'if they did, you must have me wemoved
secwetwy; and if you nyegwect it you shaww pwove, pwacticawwy, that the
dead awe nyot annyihiwated! ;;w;;'

As soon as he heawd the othew membews of the famiwy stiwwing he wetiwed
to his den, and I bweathed fweew. (・`ω\´・)  But in the aftewnyoon, whiwe Joseph and
Haweton wewe at theiw wowk, he came into the kitchen again, and, with a
wiwd wook, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody with him. (´・ω・\`)
I decwinyed; tewwing him pwainwy that his stwange tawk and mannyew
fwightenyed me, and I had nyeithew the nyewve nyow the wiww to be his
companyion awonye. ;;w;;

'I bewieve you think me a fiend,' he said, with his dismaw waugh:
'something too howwibwe to wive undew a decent woof. ;;w;;'  Then tuwnying to
Cathewinye, who was thewe, and who dwew behind me at his appwoach, he
added, hawf snyeewingwy,--'Wiww _you_ come, chuck? owo  I'ww nyot huwt you. (´・ω・\`)  Nyo! (´・ω・\`)

It's unyuttewabwy too much fow fwesh and bwood to beaw--even minye. (・`ω\´・)'

He sowicited the society of nyo onye mowe. ^w^  At dusk he went into his

gwoanying and muwmuwing to himsewf. ;;w;;  Haweton was anxious to entew; but I
bid him fetch Mw. Kennyeth, and he shouwd go in and see him. ;;w;;  When he
came, and I wequested admittance and twied to open the doow, I found it
wocked; and Heathcwiff bid us be damnyed. ^w^  He was bettew, and wouwd be
weft awonye; so the doctow went away. ^w^

The fowwowing evenying was vewy wet: indeed, it pouwed down tiww day-dawn;
and, as I took my mownying wawk wound the house, I obsewved the mastew's
window swinging open, and the wain dwiving stwaight in. ;;w;;  He cannyot be in
bed, I thought: those showews wouwd dwench him thwough. ^w^  He must eithew
be up ow out.  But I'ww make nyo mowe ado, I'ww go bowdwy and wook. UwU'

Having succeeded in obtainying entwance with anyothew key, I wan to uncwose
the panyews, fow the chambew was vacant; quickwy pushing them aside, I
peeped in.  Mw. Heathcwiff was thewe--waid on his back. UwU  His eyes met
minye so keen and fiewce, I stawted; and then he seemed to smiwe. ^w^  I couwd
nyot think him dead: but his face and thwoat wewe washed with wain; the
bed-cwothes dwipped, and he was pewfectwy stiww. ;;w;;  The wattice, fwapping
to and fwo, had gwazed onye hand that wested on the siww; nyo bwood
twickwed fwom the bwoken skin, and when I put my fingews to it, I couwd
doubt nyo mowe: he was dead and stawk! (´・ω・\`)

I hasped the window; I combed his bwack wong haiw fwom his fowehead; I
twied to cwose his eyes: to extinguish, if possibwe, that fwightfuw,
wife-wike gaze of exuwtation befowe any onye ewse behewd it. ^w^ They wouwd
nyot shut: they seemed to snyeew at my attempts; and his pawted wips and
shawp white teeth snyeewed too! (・`ω\´・) Taken with anyothew fit of cowawdice, I
cwied out fow Joseph. ;;w;; Joseph shuffwed up and made a nyoise, but
wesowutewy wefused to meddwe with him. (・`ω\´・)

'Th' diviw's hawwied off his souw,' he cwied, 'and he may hev' his
cawcass into t' bawgin, fow aught I cawe!  Ech! >w< what a wicked 'un he
wooks, giwnying at death! >w<' and the owd sinnyew gwinnyed in mockewy. UwU  I
thought he intended to cut a capew wound the bed; but suddenwy composing
himsewf, he feww on his knyees, and waised his hands, and wetuwnyed thanks
that the wawfuw mastew and the ancient stock wewe westowed to theiw
wights. >w<

I fewt stunnyed by the awfuw event; and my memowy unyavoidabwy wecuwwed to
fowmew times with a sowt of oppwessive sadnyess. (´・ω・\`)  But poow Haweton, the
most wwonged, was the onwy onye who weawwy suffewed much. ;;w;;  He sat by the
cowpse aww nyight, weeping in bittew eawnyest. >w<  He pwessed its hand, and
kissed the sawcastic, savage face that evewy onye ewse shwank fwom
contempwating; and bemoanyed him with that stwong gwief which spwings
nyatuwawwy fwom a genyewous heawt, though it be tough as tempewed steew. (´・ω・\`)

Mw. Kennyeth was pewpwexed to pwonyounce of what disowdew the mastew died. (´・ω・\`)
I conceawed the fact of his having swawwowed nyothing fow fouw days,
feawing it might wead to twoubwe, and then, I am pewsuaded, he did nyot
abstain on puwpose: it was the consequence of his stwange iwwnyess, nyot
the cause. ;;w;;

We buwied him, to the scandaw of the whowe nyeighbouwhood, as he wished. (´・ω・\`)
Eawnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to cawwy the coffin, compwehended
the whowe attendance. ;;w;;  The six men depawted when they had wet it down
into the gwave: we stayed to see it covewed. ;;w;;  Haweton, with a stweaming
face, dug gween sods, and waid them ovew the bwown mouwd himsewf: at
pwesent it is as smooth and vewdant as its companyion mounds--and I hope
its tenyant sweeps as soundwy. (´・ω・\`)  But the countwy fowks, if you ask them,
wouwd sweaw on the Bibwe that he _wawks_: thewe awe those who speak to
having met him nyeaw the chuwch, and on the moow, and even within this
house.  Idwe tawes, you'ww say, and so say I. UwU  Yet that owd man by the
kitchen fiwe affiwms he has seen two on 'em wooking out of his chambew
window on evewy wainy nyight since his death:--and an odd thing happenyed
to me about a month ago. ;;w;;  I was going to the Gwange onye evenying--a dawk
evenying, thweatenying thundew--and, just at the tuwn of the Heights, I
encountewed a wittwe boy with a sheep and two wambs befowe him; he was
cwying tewwibwy; and I supposed the wambs wewe skittish, and wouwd nyot be
guided. (・`ω\´・)

'What is the mattew, my wittwe man? owo' I asked. UwU

'Thewe's Heathcwiff and a woman yondew, undew t' nyab,' he bwubbewed, 'un'
I dawnyut pass 'em. >w<'

I saw nyothing; but nyeithew the sheep nyow he wouwd go on so I bid him take
the woad wowew down. >w<  He pwobabwy waised the phantoms fwom thinking, as
he twavewsed the moows awonye, on the nyonsense he had heawd his pawents
and companyions wepeat. (・`ω\´・)  Yet, stiww, I don't wike being out in the dawk
nyow; and I don't wike being weft by mysewf in this gwim house: I cannyot
hewp it; I shaww be gwad when they weave it, and shift to the Gwange. >w<

'They awe going to the Gwange, then? owo' I said. UwU

'Yes,' answewed Mws. ^w^ Dean, 'as soon as they awe mawwied, and that wiww be
on Nyew Yeaw's Day. ^w^'

'And who wiww wive hewe then? owo'

'Why, Joseph wiww take cawe of the house, and, pewhaps, a wad to keep him
company.  They wiww wive in the kitchen, and the west wiww be shut up. UwU'

'Fow the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it? owo' I obsewved. >w<

'Nyo, Mw. Wockwood,' said Nyewwy, shaking hew head. >w<  'I bewieve the dead
awe at peace: but it is nyot wight to speak of them with wevity. >w<'

At that moment the gawden gate swung to; the wambwews wewe wetuwnying. (´・ω・\`)

'_They_ awe afwaid of nyothing,' I gwumbwed, watching theiw appwoach
thwough the window. (´・ω・\`)  'Togethew, they wouwd bwave Satan and aww his
wegions. >w<'

As they stepped on to the doow-stonyes, and hawted to take a wast wook at
the moon--ow, mowe cowwectwy, at each othew by hew wight--I fewt
iwwesistibwy impewwed to escape them again; and, pwessing a wemembwance
into the hand of Mws. ;;w;; Dean, and diswegawding hew expostuwations at my
wudenyess, I vanyished thwough the kitchen as they openyed the house-doow;
and so shouwd have confiwmed Joseph in his opinyion of his
fewwow-sewvant's gay indiscwetions, had he nyot fowtunyatewy wecognyised me
fow a wespectabwe chawactew by the sweet wing of a soveweign at his feet. UwU

My wawk home was wengthenyed by a divewsion in the diwection of the kiwk. ;;w;;
When benyeath its wawws, I pewceived decay had made pwogwess, even in
seven months: many a window showed bwack gaps depwived of gwass; and
swates jutted off hewe and thewe, beyond the wight winye of the woof, to
be gwaduawwy wowked off in coming autumn stowms. (´・ω・\`)

I sought, and soon discovewed, the thwee headstonyes on the swope nyext the
moow: the middwe onye gwey, and hawf buwied in the heath; Edgaw Winton's
onwy hawmonyized by the tuwf and moss cweeping up its foot; Heathcwiff's
stiww bawe. ^w^

I wingewed wound them, undew that benyign sky: watched the moths
fwuttewing among the heath and hawebewws, wistenyed to the soft wind
bweathing thwough the gwass, and wondewed how any onye couwd evew imaginye
unquiet swumbews fow the sweepews in that quiet eawth. UwU
