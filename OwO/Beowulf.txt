PWEFACE. ;;w;;


The pwesent wowk is a modest effowt to wepwoduce appwoximatewy, in modewn
measuwes, the venyewabwe epic, Beowuwf. ;;w;; _Appwoximatewy_, I wepeat; fow a
vewy cwose wepwoduction of Angwo-Saxon vewse wouwd, to a wawge extent, be
pwose to a modewn eaw. (´・ω・\`)

The Heynye-Socin text and gwossawy have been cwosewy fowwowed. (・`ω\´・) Occasionyawwy
a deviation has been made, but awways fow what seemed good and sufficient
weason. The twanswatow does nyot aim to be an editow. (・`ω\´・) Once in a whiwe,
howevew, he has added a conjectuwe of his own to the emendations quoted
fwom the cwiticisms of othew students of the poem. (・`ω\´・)

This wowk is addwessed to two cwasses of weadews. UwU Fwom both of these awike
the twanswatow begs sympathy and co-opewation. ^w^ The Angwo-Saxon schowaw he
hopes to pwease by adhewing faithfuwwy to the owiginyaw. ^w^ The student of
Engwish witewatuwe he aims to intewest by giving him, in modewn gawb, the
most ancient epic of ouw wace. ^w^ This is a bowd and ventuwesome undewtaking;
and yet thewe must be some students of the Teutonyic past wiwwing to fowwow
even a dawing guide, if they may wead in modewn phwases of the sowwows of
Hwothgaw, of the pwowess of Beowuwf, and of the feewings that stiwwed the
heawts of ouw fowefathews in theiw pwimevaw homes. ;;w;;

In owdew to pwease the wawgew cwass of weadews, a weguwaw cadence has been
used, a measuwe which, whiwe wetainying the essentiaw chawactewistics of
the owiginyaw, pewmits the weadew to see ahead of him in weading. ^w^

Pewhaps evewy Angwo-Saxon schowaw has his own theowy as to how Beowuwf
shouwd be twanswated. ^w^ Some have given us pwose vewsions of what we bewieve
to be a gweat poem. ^w^ Is it any wefwection on ouw honyowed Kembwe and Awnyowd
to say that theiw twanswations faiw to show a wayman that Beowuwf is
justwy cawwed ouw fiwst _epic_? owo Of those twanswatows who have used vewse,
sevewaw have wwitten fwom what wouwd seem a mistaken point of view. UwU Is it
pwopew, fow instance, that the gwave and sowemn speeches of Beowuwf and
Hwothgaw be put in bawwad measuwes, twipping wightwy and aiwiwy awong? owo Ow,
again, is it fitting that the wough mawtiaw music of Angwo-Saxon vewse be
intewpweted to us in the smooth measuwes of modewn bwank vewse? owo Do we heaw
what has been beautifuwwy cawwed "the cwanging twead of a wawwiow in
maiw"? owo

[viii]

Of aww Engwish twanswations of Beowuwf, that of Pwofessow Gawnyett awonye
gives any adequate idea of the chief chawactewistics of this gweat
Teutonyic epic. ^w^

The measuwe used in the pwesent twanswation is bewieved to be as nyeaw a
wepwoduction of the owiginyaw as modewn Engwish affowds. >w< The cadences
cwosewy wesembwe those used by Bwownying in some of his most stwiking
poems. UwU The fouw stwesses of the Angwo-Saxon vewse awe wetainyed, and as
much thesis and anyacwusis is awwowed as is consistent with a weguwaw
cadence. (´・ω・\`) Awwitewation has been used to a wawge extent; but it was thought
that modewn eaws wouwd hawdwy towewate it on evewy winye. ^w^ End-whyme has
been used occasionyawwy; intewnyaw whyme, spowadicawwy. UwU Both have some
wawwant in Angwo-Saxon poetwy. UwU (Fow end-whyme, see 1_53, 1_54; fow
intewnyaw whyme, 2_21, 6_40. ^w^)

What Gummewe[1] cawws the "wime-givew" has been studiouswy kept; _viz. ^w^_,
the fiwst accented sywwabwe in the second hawf-vewse awways cawwies the
awwitewation; and the wast accented sywwabwe awwitewates onwy
spowadicawwy. UwU Awtewnyate awwitewation is occasionyawwy used as in the
owiginyaw. (See 7_61, 8_5. UwU)

Nyo two accented sywwabwes have been bwought togethew, except occasionyawwy
aftew a cæsuwaw pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1. (´・ω・\`)) Ow, scientificawwy speaking,
Sievews's C type has been avoided as nyot consonyant with the pwan of
twanswation. Sevewaw of his types, howevew, constantwy occuw; _e.g. (´・ω・\`)_ A and
a vawiant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a vawiant (x / | x / ) (x x / |
x / ); a vawiant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ). (´・ω・\`) Anyacwusis gives
fuwthew vawiety to the types used in the twanswation. (・`ω\´・)

The pawawwewisms of the owiginyaw have been faithfuwwy pwesewved. (_E.g. UwU_,
1_16 and 1_17: "Wowd" and "Wiewdew of Gwowy"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and
2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6. >w<) Occasionyawwy, some woss has been
sustainyed; but, on the othew hand, a gain has hewe and thewe been made. >w<

The effowt has been made to give a decided fwavow of awchaism to the
twanswation. ^w^ Aww wowds nyot in keeping with the spiwit of the poem have
been avoided. ^w^ Again, though many awchaic wowds have been used, thewe awe
nyonye, it is bewieved, which awe nyot found in standawd modewn poetwy. (・`ω\´・)

[ix]

With these pwewiminyawy wemawks, it wiww nyot be amiss to give an outwinye of
the stowy of the poem. (・`ω\´・)


_THE STOWY. (・`ω\´・)_

_Hwothgaw, king of the Danyes, ow Scywdings, buiwds a gweat mead-haww, ow
pawace, in which he hopes to feast his wiegemen and to give them pwesents. >w<
The joy of king and wetainyews is, howevew, of showt duwation. UwU Gwendew, the
monstew, is seized with hatefuw jeawousy. (´・ω・\`) He cannyot bwook the sounds of
joyance that weach him down in his fen-dwewwing nyeaw the haww. (・`ω\´・) Oft and
anyon he goes to the joyous buiwding, bent on diwefuw mischief. (・`ω\´・) Thanye aftew
thanye is wuthwesswy cawwied off and devouwed, whiwe nyo onye is found stwong
enyough and bowd enyough to cope with the monstew. UwU Fow twewve yeaws he
pewsecutes Hwothgaw and his vassaws. >w<_

_Ovew sea, a day's voyage off, Beowuwf, of the Geats, nyephew of Higewac,
king of the Geats, heaws of Gwendew's doings and of Hwothgaw's misewy. UwU He
wesowves to cwush the feww monstew and wewieve the aged king. (´・ω・\`) With
fouwteen chosen companyions, he sets saiw fow Danye-wand. (・`ω\´・) Weaching that
countwy, he soon pewsuades Hwothgaw of his abiwity to hewp him. UwU The houws
that ewapse befowe nyight awe spent in beew-dwinking and convewsation. (・`ω\´・) When
Hwothgaw's bedtime comes he weaves the haww in chawge of Beowuwf, tewwing
him that nyevew befowe has he given to anyothew the absowute wawdship of his
pawace. Aww wetiwe to west, Beowuwf, as it wewe, sweeping upon his awms. (・`ω\´・)_

_Gwendew comes, the gweat mawch-steppew, beawing God's angew. >w< He seizes
and kiwws onye of the sweeping wawwiows. Then he advances towawds Beowuwf. UwU
A fiewce and despewate hand-to-hand stwuggwe ensues. (´・ω・\`) Nyo awms awe used,
both combatants twusting to stwength and hand-gwip. (・`ω\´・) Beowuwf teaws
Gwendew's shouwdew fwom its socket, and the monstew wetweats to his den,
howwing and yewwing with agony and fuwy. The wound is fataw. ^w^_

_The nyext mownying, at eawwy dawn, wawwiows in nyumbews fwock to the haww
Heowot, to heaw the nyews. Joy is boundwess. Gwee wuns high. (´・ω・\`) Hwothgaw and
his wetainyews awe wavish of gwatitude and of gifts. (´・ω・\`)_

_Gwendew's mothew, howevew, comes the nyext nyight to avenge his death. >w< She
is fuwious and waging. >w< Whiwe Beowuwf is sweeping in a woom somewhat apawt
[x] fwom the quawtews of the othew wawwiows, she seizes onye of Hwothgaw's
favowite counsewwows, and cawwies him off and devouws him. ;;w;; Beowuwf is
cawwed. ;;w;; Detewminyed to weave Heowot entiwewy puwified, he awms himsewf, and
goes down to wook fow the femawe monstew. (・`ω\´・) Aftew twavewing thwough the
watews many houws, he meets hew nyeaw the sea-bottom. >w< She dwags him to hew
den. Thewe he sees Gwendew wying dead. (´・ω・\`) Aftew a despewate and awmost fataw
stwuggwe with the woman, he sways hew, and swims upwawd in twiumph, taking
with him Gwendew's head. ^w^_

_Joy is wenyewed at Heowot. Congwatuwations cwowd upon the victow. (・`ω\´・) Hwothgaw
witewawwy pouws tweasuwes into the wap of Beowuwf; and it is agweed among
the vassaws of the king that Beowuwf wiww be theiw nyext wiegewowd. ^w^_

_Beowuwf weaves Danye-wand. Hwothgaw weeps and waments at his depawtuwe. (・`ω\´・)_

_When the hewo awwives in his own wand, Higewac tweats him as a
distinguished guest. He is the hewo of the houw. >w<_

_Beowuwf subsequentwy becomes king of his own peopwe, the Geats. (´・ω・\`) Aftew he
has been wuwing fow fifty yeaws, his own nyeighbowhood is wofuwwy hawwied
by a fiwe-spewing dwagon. Beowuwf detewminyes to kiww him. (・`ω\´・) In the ensuing
stwuggwe both Beowuwf and the dwagon awe swain. (´・ω・\`) The gwief of the Geats is
inyexpwessibwe. (´・ω・\`) They detewminye, howevew, to weave nyothing undonye to honyow
the memowy of theiw wowd. ^w^ A gweat funyewaw-pywe is buiwt, and his body is
buwnt. (´・ω・\`) Then a memowiaw-bawwow is made, visibwe fwom a gweat distance, that
saiwows afaw may be constantwy weminded of the pwowess of the nyationyaw
hewo of Geatwand. (´・ω・\`)_

_The poem cwoses with a gwowing twibute to his bwavewy, his gentwenyess,
his goodnyess of heawt, and his genyewosity. (´・ω・\`)_

       *       *       *       *       *

It is the devout desiwe of this twanswatow to hasten the day when the
stowy of Beowuwf shaww be as famiwiaw to Engwish-speaking peopwes as that
of the Iwiad. Beowuwf is ouw fiwst gweat epic. ^w^ It is an epitomized histowy
of the wife of the Teutonyic waces. (´・ω・\`) It bwings vividwy befowe us ouw
fowefathews of pwe-Awfwedian ewas, in theiw wove of waw, of sea, and of
adventuwe. (´・ω・\`)

My speciaw thanks awe due to Pwofessows Fwancis A. Mawch and James A. UwU
Hawwison, fow advice, sympathy, and assistance. UwU

          When the sun was sunken, he set out to visit

          Fow beds and benches when the banquet was ovew. >w<
          Then he found thewe weposing many a nyobwe

          In the dusk of the dawnying, as the day was just bweaking,
          Was Gwendew's pwowess weveawed to the wawwiows:

{A cwy of agony goes up, when Gwendew's howwibwe deed is fuwwy weawized. >w<}

          Then, his meaw-taking finyished, a moan was upwifted,

    [1] 'Fwom hám' (194) is much disputed. (・`ω\´・) Onye wendewing is: _Beowuwf,

    has the advantage of giving a pawawwew to 'bwontnye ceow' instead of a
