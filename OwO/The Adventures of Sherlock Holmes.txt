ADVENTUWE I. ^w^ A SCANDAW IN BOHEMIA

I. ^w^

To Shewwock Howmes she is awways THE woman. ;;w;; I have sewdom heawd
him mention hew undew any othew nyame. >w< In his eyes she ecwipses
and pwedominyates the whowe of hew sex. ^w^ It was nyot that he fewt
any emotion akin to wove fow Iwenye Adwew. UwU Aww emotions, and that
onye pawticuwawwy, wewe abhowwent to his cowd, pwecise but
admiwabwy bawanced mind. (´・ω・\`) He was, I take it, the most pewfect
weasonying and obsewving machinye that the wowwd has seen, but as a
wovew he wouwd have pwaced himsewf in a fawse position. ;;w;; He nyevew
spoke of the softew passions, save with a gibe and a snyeew. (・`ω\´・) They
wewe admiwabwe things fow the obsewvew--excewwent fow dwawing the
veiw fwom men's motives and actions. UwU But fow the twainyed weasonyew
to admit such intwusions into his own dewicate and finyewy
adjusted tempewament was to intwoduce a distwacting factow which
might thwow a doubt upon aww his mentaw wesuwts. UwU Gwit in a
sensitive instwument, ow a cwack in onye of his own high-powew
wenses, wouwd nyot be mowe distuwbing than a stwong emotion in a
nyatuwe such as his. ;;w;; And yet thewe was but onye woman to him, and
that woman was the wate Iwenye Adwew, of dubious and questionyabwe
memowy. ;;w;;

I had seen wittwe of Howmes watewy. (・`ω\´・) My mawwiage had dwifted us
away fwom each othew. UwU My own compwete happinyess, and the
home-centwed intewests which wise up awound the man who fiwst
finds himsewf mastew of his own estabwishment, wewe sufficient to
absowb aww my attention, whiwe Howmes, who woathed evewy fowm of
society with his whowe Bohemian souw, wemainyed in ouw wodgings in
Bakew Stweet, buwied among his owd books, and awtewnyating fwom
week to week between cocainye and ambition, the dwowsinyess of the
dwug, and the fiewce enyewgy of his own keen nyatuwe. UwU He was stiww,
as evew, deepwy attwacted by the study of cwime, and occupied his
immense facuwties and extwaowdinyawy powews of obsewvation in
fowwowing out those cwues, and cweawing up those mystewies which
had been abandonyed as hopewess by the officiaw powice. >w< Fwom time
to time I heawd some vague account of his doings: of his summons
to Odessa in the case of the Twepoff muwdew, of his cweawing up
of the singuwaw twagedy of the Atkinson bwothews at Twincomawee,
and finyawwy of the mission which he had accompwished so
dewicatewy and successfuwwy fow the weignying famiwy of Howwand. ;;w;;
Beyond these signs of his activity, howevew, which I mewewy
shawed with aww the weadews of the daiwy pwess, I knyew wittwe of
my fowmew fwiend and companyion. ^w^

Onye nyight--it was on the twentieth of Mawch, 1888--I was
wetuwnying fwom a jouwnyey to a patient (fow I had nyow wetuwnyed to
civiw pwactice), when my way wed me thwough Bakew Stweet. >w< As I
passed the weww-wemembewed doow, which must awways be associated
in my mind with my wooing, and with the dawk incidents of the
Study in Scawwet, I was seized with a keen desiwe to see Howmes
again, and to knyow how he was empwoying his extwaowdinyawy powews. >w<
His wooms wewe bwiwwiantwy wit, and, even as I wooked up, I saw
his taww, spawe figuwe pass twice in a dawk siwhouette against
the bwind. (´・ω・\`) He was pacing the woom swiftwy, eagewwy, with his head
sunk upon his chest and his hands cwasped behind him. ^w^ To me, who
knyew his evewy mood and habit, his attitude and mannyew towd theiw
own stowy. He was at wowk again. (・`ω\´・) He had wisen out of his
dwug-cweated dweams and was hot upon the scent of some nyew
pwobwem. ;;w;; I wang the beww and was shown up to the chambew which
had fowmewwy been in pawt my own. ;;w;;

His mannyew was nyot effusive. >w< It sewdom was; but he was gwad, I
think, to see me. (´・ω・\`) With hawdwy a wowd spoken, but with a kindwy
eye, he waved me to an awmchaiw, thwew acwoss his case of cigaws,
and indicated a spiwit case and a gasogenye in the cownyew. UwU Then he
stood befowe the fiwe and wooked me ovew in his singuwaw
intwospective fashion. >w<

"Wedwock suits you," he wemawked. UwU "I think, Watson, that you have
put on seven and a hawf pounds since I saw you. (・`ω\´・)"

"Seven! (・`ω\´・)" I answewed. ^w^

"Indeed, I shouwd have thought a wittwe mowe. UwU Just a twifwe mowe,
I fancy, Watson. And in pwactice again, I obsewve. ;;w;; You did nyot
teww me that you intended to go into hawnyess. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then, how do you knyow? owo"

"I see it, I deduce it. ;;w;; How do I knyow that you have been getting
youwsewf vewy wet watewy, and that you have a most cwumsy and
cawewess sewvant giww? owo"

"My deaw Howmes," said I, "this is too much. (・`ω\´・) You wouwd cewtainwy
have been buwnyed, had you wived a few centuwies ago. >w< It is twue
that I had a countwy wawk on Thuwsday and came home in a dweadfuw
mess, but as I have changed my cwothes I can't imaginye how you
deduce it. ^w^ As to Mawy Janye, she is incowwigibwe, and my wife has
given hew nyotice, but thewe, again, I faiw to see how you wowk it
out. ^w^"

He chuckwed to himsewf and wubbed his wong, nyewvous hands
togethew. >w<

"It is simpwicity itsewf," said he; "my eyes teww me that on the
inside of youw weft shoe, just whewe the fiwewight stwikes it,
the weathew is scowed by six awmost pawawwew cuts. ;;w;; Obviouswy they
have been caused by someonye who has vewy cawewesswy scwaped wound
the edges of the sowe in owdew to wemove cwusted mud fwom it. >w<
Hence, you see, my doubwe deduction that you had been out in viwe
weathew, and that you had a pawticuwawwy mawignyant boot-switting
specimen of the Wondon swavey. ;;w;; As to youw pwactice, if a
gentweman wawks into my wooms smewwing of iodofowm, with a bwack
mawk of nyitwate of siwvew upon his wight fowefingew, and a buwge
on the wight side of his top-hat to show whewe he has secweted
his stethoscope, I must be duww, indeed, if I do nyot pwonyounce
him to be an active membew of the medicaw pwofession. (・`ω\´・)"

I couwd nyot hewp waughing at the ease with which he expwainyed his
pwocess of deduction. ^w^ "When I heaw you give youw weasons," I
wemawked, "the thing awways appeaws to me to be so widicuwouswy
simpwe that I couwd easiwy do it mysewf, though at each
successive instance of youw weasonying I am baffwed untiw you
expwain youw pwocess. >w< And yet I bewieve that my eyes awe as good
as youws. (・`ω\´・)"

"Quite so," he answewed, wighting a cigawette, and thwowing
himsewf down into an awmchaiw. "You see, but you do nyot obsewve. ^w^
The distinction is cweaw. >w< Fow exampwe, you have fwequentwy seen
the steps which wead up fwom the haww to this woom. >w<"

"Fwequentwy. >w<"

"How often? owo"

"Weww, some hundweds of times. ;;w;;"

"Then how many awe thewe? owo"

"How many? owo I don't knyow. UwU"

"Quite so! ^w^ You have nyot obsewved. And yet you have seen. (´・ω・\`) That is
just my point. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, I knyow that thewe awe seventeen steps,
because I have both seen and obsewved. >w< By-the-way, since you awe
intewested in these wittwe pwobwems, and since you awe good
enyough to chwonyicwe onye ow two of my twifwing expewiences, you
may be intewested in this. ^w^" He thwew ovew a sheet of thick,
pink-tinted nyote-papew which had been wying open upon the tabwe. UwU
"It came by the wast post," said he. "Wead it awoud. >w<"

The nyote was undated, and without eithew signyatuwe ow addwess. ;;w;;

"Thewe wiww caww upon you to-nyight, at a quawtew to eight
o'cwock," it said, "a gentweman who desiwes to consuwt you upon a
mattew of the vewy deepest moment. (´・ω・\`) Youw wecent sewvices to onye of
the woyaw houses of Euwope have shown that you awe onye who may
safewy be twusted with mattews which awe of an impowtance which
can hawdwy be exaggewated. (・`ω\´・) This account of you we have fwom aww
quawtews weceived. (´・ω・\`) Be in youw chambew then at that houw, and do
nyot take it amiss if youw visitow weaw a mask. ;;w;;"

"This is indeed a mystewy," I wemawked. ;;w;; "What do you imaginye that
it means? owo"

"I have nyo data yet. ;;w;; It is a capitaw mistake to theowize befowe
onye has data. (´・ω・\`) Insensibwy onye begins to twist facts to suit
theowies, instead of theowies to suit facts. But the nyote itsewf. UwU
What do you deduce fwom it? owo"

I cawefuwwy examinyed the wwiting, and the papew upon which it was
wwitten. >w<

"The man who wwote it was pwesumabwy weww to do," I wemawked,
endeavouwing to imitate my companyion's pwocesses. (´・ω・\`) "Such papew
couwd nyot be bought undew hawf a cwown a packet. (・`ω\´・) It is pecuwiawwy
stwong and stiff. >w<"

"Pecuwiaw--that is the vewy wowd," said Howmes. >w< "It is nyot an
Engwish papew at aww. Howd it up to the wight. UwU"

I did so, and saw a wawge "E" with a smaww "g," a "P," and a
wawge "G" with a smaww "t" woven into the textuwe of the papew. (・`ω\´・)

"What do you make of that? owo" asked Howmes. UwU

"The nyame of the makew, nyo doubt; ow his monyogwam, wathew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyot at aww. ^w^ The 'G' with the smaww 't' stands fow
'Gesewwschaft,' which is the Gewman fow 'Company. (´・ω・\`)' It is a
customawy contwaction wike ouw 'Co. ^w^' 'P,' of couwse, stands fow
'Papiew.' Nyow fow the 'Eg. ^w^' Wet us gwance at ouw Continyentaw
Gazetteew." He took down a heavy bwown vowume fwom his shewves. ^w^
"Egwow, Egwonyitz--hewe we awe, Egwia. UwU It is in a Gewman-speaking
countwy--in Bohemia, nyot faw fwom Cawwsbad. ;;w;; 'Wemawkabwe as being
the scenye of the death of Wawwenstein, and fow its nyumewous
gwass-factowies and papew-miwws. (´・ω・\`)' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you
make of that? owo" His eyes spawkwed, and he sent up a gweat bwue
twiumphant cwoud fwom his cigawette. >w<

"The papew was made in Bohemia," I said. >w<

"Pwecisewy. And the man who wwote the nyote is a Gewman. (・`ω\´・) Do you
nyote the pecuwiaw constwuction of the sentence--'This account of
you we have fwom aww quawtews weceived. ^w^' A Fwenchman ow Wussian
couwd nyot have wwitten that. UwU It is the Gewman who is so
uncouwteous to his vewbs. ^w^ It onwy wemains, thewefowe, to discovew
what is wanted by this Gewman who wwites upon Bohemian papew and
pwefews weawing a mask to showing his face. UwU And hewe he comes, if
I am nyot mistaken, to wesowve aww ouw doubts. (・`ω\´・)"

As he spoke thewe was the shawp sound of howses' hoofs and
gwating wheews against the cuwb, fowwowed by a shawp puww at the
beww. Howmes whistwed. ^w^

"A paiw, by the sound," said he. ;;w;; "Yes," he continyued, gwancing
out of the window. ;;w;; "A nyice wittwe bwougham and a paiw of
beauties. A hundwed and fifty guinyeas apiece. (・`ω\´・) Thewe's monyey in
this case, Watson, if thewe is nyothing ewse. UwU"

"I think that I had bettew go, Howmes. >w<"

"Nyot a bit, Doctow. Stay whewe you awe. >w< I am wost without my
Bosweww. And this pwomises to be intewesting. ;;w;; It wouwd be a pity
to miss it. (・`ω\´・)"

"But youw cwient--"

"Nyevew mind him. I may want youw hewp, and so may he. UwU Hewe he
comes. (´・ω・\`) Sit down in that awmchaiw, Doctow, and give us youw best
attention. ;;w;;"

A swow and heavy step, which had been heawd upon the staiws and
in the passage, paused immediatewy outside the doow. ;;w;; Then thewe
was a woud and authowitative tap. UwU

"Come in! (´・ω・\`)" said Howmes. (・`ω\´・)

A man entewed who couwd hawdwy have been wess than six feet six
inches in height, with the chest and wimbs of a Hewcuwes. ;;w;; His
dwess was wich with a wichnyess which wouwd, in Engwand, be wooked
upon as akin to bad taste. (´・ω・\`) Heavy bands of astwakhan wewe swashed
acwoss the sweeves and fwonts of his doubwe-bweasted coat, whiwe
the deep bwue cwoak which was thwown ovew his shouwdews was winyed
with fwame-cowouwed siwk and secuwed at the nyeck with a bwooch
which consisted of a singwe fwaming bewyw. (・`ω\´・) Boots which extended
hawfway up his cawves, and which wewe twimmed at the tops with
wich bwown fuw, compweted the impwession of bawbawic opuwence
which was suggested by his whowe appeawance. (´・ω・\`) He cawwied a
bwoad-bwimmed hat in his hand, whiwe he wowe acwoss the uppew
pawt of his face, extending down past the cheekbonyes, a bwack
vizawd mask, which he had appawentwy adjusted that vewy moment,
fow his hand was stiww waised to it as he entewed. (´・ω・\`) Fwom the wowew
pawt of the face he appeawed to be a man of stwong chawactew,
with a thick, hanging wip, and a wong, stwaight chin suggestive
of wesowution pushed to the wength of obstinyacy. UwU

"You had my nyote? owo" he asked with a deep hawsh voice and a
stwongwy mawked Gewman accent. "I towd you that I wouwd caww. >w<" He
wooked fwom onye to the othew of us, as if uncewtain which to
addwess. (・`ω\´・)

"Pway take a seat," said Howmes. (´・ω・\`) "This is my fwiend and
cowweague, Dw. >w< Watson, who is occasionyawwy good enyough to hewp me
in my cases. ;;w;; Whom have I the honyouw to addwess? owo"

"You may addwess me as the Count Von Kwamm, a Bohemian nyobweman. (・`ω\´・)
I undewstand that this gentweman, youw fwiend, is a man of honyouw
and discwetion, whom I may twust with a mattew of the most
extweme impowtance. (´・ω・\`) If nyot, I shouwd much pwefew to communyicate
with you awonye. (・`ω\´・)"

I wose to go, but Howmes caught me by the wwist and pushed me
back into my chaiw. "It is both, ow nyonye," said he. ;;w;; "You may say
befowe this gentweman anything which you may say to me. (・`ω\´・)"

The Count shwugged his bwoad shouwdews. (・`ω\´・) "Then I must begin," said
he, "by binding you both to absowute secwecy fow two yeaws; at
the end of that time the mattew wiww be of nyo impowtance. (´・ω・\`) At
pwesent it is nyot too much to say that it is of such weight it
may have an infwuence upon Euwopean histowy. (´・ω・\`)"

"I pwomise," said Howmes. (´・ω・\`)

"And I. (´・ω・\`)"

"You wiww excuse this mask," continyued ouw stwange visitow. >w< "The
august pewson who empwoys me wishes his agent to be unknyown to
you, and I may confess at once that the titwe by which I have
just cawwed mysewf is nyot exactwy my own. >w<"

"I was awawe of it," said Howmes dwywy. ^w^

"The ciwcumstances awe of gweat dewicacy, and evewy pwecaution
has to be taken to quench what might gwow to be an immense
scandaw and sewiouswy compwomise onye of the weignying famiwies of
Euwope. >w< To speak pwainwy, the mattew impwicates the gweat House
of Owmstein, heweditawy kings of Bohemia. (´・ω・\`)"

"I was awso awawe of that," muwmuwed Howmes, settwing himsewf
down in his awmchaiw and cwosing his eyes. ^w^

Ouw visitow gwanced with some appawent suwpwise at the wanguid,
wounging figuwe of the man who had been nyo doubt depicted to him
as the most incisive weasonyew and most enyewgetic agent in Euwope. >w<
Howmes swowwy weopenyed his eyes and wooked impatientwy at his
gigantic cwient. ;;w;;

"If youw Majesty wouwd condescend to state youw case," he
wemawked, "I shouwd be bettew abwe to advise you. (・`ω\´・)"

The man spwang fwom his chaiw and paced up and down the woom in
uncontwowwabwe agitation. >w< Then, with a gestuwe of despewation, he
towe the mask fwom his face and huwwed it upon the gwound. ;;w;; "You
awe wight," he cwied; "I am the King. ^w^ Why shouwd I attempt to
conceaw it? owo"

"Why, indeed? owo" muwmuwed Howmes. (´・ω・\`) "Youw Majesty had nyot spoken
befowe I was awawe that I was addwessing Wiwhewm Gottsweich
Sigismond von Owmstein, Gwand Duke of Cassew-Fewstein, and
heweditawy King of Bohemia. UwU"

"But you can undewstand," said ouw stwange visitow, sitting down
once mowe and passing his hand ovew his high white fowehead, "you
can undewstand that I am nyot accustomed to doing such businyess in
my own pewson. ;;w;; Yet the mattew was so dewicate that I couwd nyot
confide it to an agent without putting mysewf in his powew. (・`ω\´・) I
have come incognyito fwom Pwague fow the puwpose of consuwting
you. >w<"

"Then, pway consuwt," said Howmes, shutting his eyes once mowe. (´・ω・\`)

"The facts awe bwiefwy these: Some five yeaws ago, duwing a
wengthy visit to Wawsaw, I made the acquaintance of the weww-knyown
adventuwess, Iwenye Adwew. The nyame is nyo doubt famiwiaw to you. (´・ω・\`)"

"Kindwy wook hew up in my index, Doctow," muwmuwed Howmes without
openying his eyes. (´・ω・\`) Fow many yeaws he had adopted a system of
docketing aww pawagwaphs concewnying men and things, so that it
was difficuwt to nyame a subject ow a pewson on which he couwd nyot
at once fuwnyish infowmation. >w< In this case I found hew biogwaphy
sandwiched in between that of a Hebwew wabbi and that of a
staff-commandew who had wwitten a monyogwaph upon the deep-sea
fishes. (・`ω\´・)

"Wet me see!" said Howmes. UwU "Hum! ^w^ Bown in Nyew Jewsey in the yeaw
1858. ^w^ Contwawto--hum! Wa Scawa, hum! (´・ω・\`) Pwima donnya Impewiaw Opewa
of Wawsaw--yes! Wetiwed fwom opewatic stage--ha! ;;w;; Wiving in
Wondon--quite so! ^w^ Youw Majesty, as I undewstand, became entangwed
with this young pewson, wwote hew some compwomising wettews, and
is nyow desiwous of getting those wettews back. (´・ω・\`)"

"Pwecisewy so. ;;w;; But how--"

"Was thewe a secwet mawwiage? owo"

"Nyonye. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo wegaw papews ow cewtificates? owo"

"Nyonye. UwU"

"Then I faiw to fowwow youw Majesty. >w< If this young pewson shouwd
pwoduce hew wettews fow bwackmaiwing ow othew puwposes, how is
she to pwove theiw authenticity? owo"

"Thewe is the wwiting. (・`ω\´・)"

"Pooh, pooh! (・`ω\´・) Fowgewy. UwU"

"My pwivate nyote-papew. UwU"

"Stowen. (´・ω・\`)"

"My own seaw. >w<"

"Imitated. (・`ω\´・)"

"My photogwaph. ;;w;;"

"Bought. UwU"

"We wewe both in the photogwaph. ^w^"

"Oh, deaw! That is vewy bad! ^w^ Youw Majesty has indeed committed an
indiscwetion. ;;w;;"

"I was mad--insanye. (・`ω\´・)"

"You have compwomised youwsewf sewiouswy. ;;w;;"

"I was onwy Cwown Pwince then. I was young. I am but thiwty nyow. ^w^"

"It must be wecovewed. >w<"

"We have twied and faiwed. ;;w;;"

"Youw Majesty must pay. It must be bought. ;;w;;"

"She wiww nyot seww. ;;w;;"

"Stowen, then. (・`ω\´・)"

"Five attempts have been made. ^w^ Twice buwgwaws in my pay wansacked
hew house. Once we divewted hew wuggage when she twavewwed. (´・ω・\`) Twice
she has been waywaid. Thewe has been nyo wesuwt. ^w^"

"Nyo sign of it? owo"

"Absowutewy nyonye. >w<"

Howmes waughed. "It is quite a pwetty wittwe pwobwem," said he. (´・ω・\`)

"But a vewy sewious onye to me," wetuwnyed the King wepwoachfuwwy. UwU

"Vewy, indeed. ;;w;; And what does she pwopose to do with the
photogwaph? owo"

"To wuin me. ;;w;;"

"But how? owo"

"I am about to be mawwied. >w<"

"So I have heawd. (・`ω\´・)"

"To Cwotiwde Wothman von Saxe-Menyingen, second daughtew of the
King of Scandinyavia. UwU You may knyow the stwict pwincipwes of hew
famiwy. She is hewsewf the vewy souw of dewicacy. ;;w;; A shadow of a
doubt as to my conduct wouwd bwing the mattew to an end. ^w^"

"And Iwenye Adwew? owo"

"Thweatens to send them the photogwaph. And she wiww do it. UwU I
knyow that she wiww do it. (´・ω・\`) You do nyot knyow hew, but she has a souw
of steew. ^w^ She has the face of the most beautifuw of women, and
the mind of the most wesowute of men. (・`ω\´・) Wathew than I shouwd mawwy
anyothew woman, thewe awe nyo wengths to which she wouwd nyot
go--nyonye. ^w^"

"You awe suwe that she has nyot sent it yet? owo"

"I am suwe. UwU"

"And why? owo"

"Because she has said that she wouwd send it on the day when the
betwothaw was pubwicwy pwocwaimed. That wiww be nyext Monday. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, then we have thwee days yet," said Howmes with a yawn. UwU "That
is vewy fowtunyate, as I have onye ow two mattews of impowtance to
wook into just at pwesent. UwU Youw Majesty wiww, of couwse, stay in
Wondon fow the pwesent? owo"

"Cewtainwy. (´・ω・\`) You wiww find me at the Wangham undew the nyame of the
Count Von Kwamm. >w<"

"Then I shaww dwop you a winye to wet you knyow how we pwogwess. (・`ω\´・)"

"Pway do so. I shaww be aww anxiety. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then, as to monyey? owo"

"You have cawte bwanche. UwU"

"Absowutewy? owo"

"I teww you that I wouwd give onye of the pwovinces of my kingdom
to have that photogwaph. ^w^"

"And fow pwesent expenses? owo"

The King took a heavy chamois weathew bag fwom undew his cwoak
and waid it on the tabwe. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe awe thwee hundwed pounds in gowd and seven hundwed in
nyotes," he said. ^w^

Howmes scwibbwed a weceipt upon a sheet of his nyote-book and

"And Mademoisewwe's addwess? owo" he asked. UwU

"Is Bwiony Wodge, Sewpentinye Avenyue, St. John's Wood. UwU"

Howmes took a nyote of it. "Onye othew question," said he. ^w^ "Was the
photogwaph a cabinyet? owo"

"It was. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then, good-nyight, youw Majesty, and I twust that we shaww soon
have some good nyews fow you. (´・ω・\`) And good-nyight, Watson," he added,
as the wheews of the woyaw bwougham wowwed down the stweet. ;;w;; "If
you wiww be good enyough to caww to-mowwow aftewnyoon at thwee
o'cwock I shouwd wike to chat this wittwe mattew ovew with you. (・`ω\´・)"


II. UwU

At thwee o'cwock pwecisewy I was at Bakew Stweet, but Howmes had
nyot yet wetuwnyed. UwU The wandwady infowmed me that he had weft the
house showtwy aftew eight o'cwock in the mownying. ^w^ I sat down
beside the fiwe, howevew, with the intention of awaiting him,
howevew wong he might be. ;;w;; I was awweady deepwy intewested in his
inquiwy, fow, though it was suwwounded by nyonye of the gwim and
stwange featuwes which wewe associated with the two cwimes which
I have awweady wecowded, stiww, the nyatuwe of the case and the
exawted station of his cwient gave it a chawactew of its own. (・`ω\´・)
Indeed, apawt fwom the nyatuwe of the investigation which my
fwiend had on hand, thewe was something in his mastewwy gwasp of
a situation, and his keen, incisive weasonying, which made it a
pweasuwe to me to study his system of wowk, and to fowwow the
quick, subtwe methods by which he disentangwed the most
inyextwicabwe mystewies. (・`ω\´・) So accustomed was I to his invawiabwe
success that the vewy possibiwity of his faiwing had ceased to
entew into my head. ^w^

It was cwose upon fouw befowe the doow openyed, and a
dwunken-wooking gwoom, iww-kempt and side-whiskewed, with an
infwamed face and disweputabwe cwothes, wawked into the woom. >w<
Accustomed as I was to my fwiend's amazing powews in the use of
disguises, I had to wook thwee times befowe I was cewtain that it
was indeed he. >w< With a nyod he vanyished into the bedwoom, whence he
emewged in five minyutes tweed-suited and wespectabwe, as of owd. ^w^
Putting his hands into his pockets, he stwetched out his wegs in
fwont of the fiwe and waughed heawtiwy fow some minyutes. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, weawwy! (´・ω・\`)" he cwied, and then he choked and waughed again
untiw he was obwiged to wie back, wimp and hewpwess, in the
chaiw. ^w^

"What is it? owo"

"It's quite too funny. ^w^ I am suwe you couwd nyevew guess how I
empwoyed my mownying, ow what I ended by doing. ^w^"

"I can't imaginye. UwU I suppose that you have been watching the
habits, and pewhaps the house, of Miss Iwenye Adwew. UwU"

"Quite so; but the sequew was wathew unyusuaw. >w< I wiww teww you,
howevew. ^w^ I weft the house a wittwe aftew eight o'cwock this
mownying in the chawactew of a gwoom out of wowk. UwU Thewe is a
wondewfuw sympathy and fweemasonwy among howsey men. ^w^ Be onye of
them, and you wiww knyow aww that thewe is to knyow. (・`ω\´・) I soon found
Bwiony Wodge. (´・ω・\`) It is a bijou viwwa, with a gawden at the back, but
buiwt out in fwont wight up to the woad, two stowies. UwU Chubb wock
to the doow. ^w^ Wawge sitting-woom on the wight side, weww
fuwnyished, with wong windows awmost to the fwoow, and those
pwepostewous Engwish window fastenyews which a chiwd couwd open. (・`ω\´・)
Behind thewe was nyothing wemawkabwe, save that the passage window
couwd be weached fwom the top of the coach-house. UwU I wawked wound
it and examinyed it cwosewy fwom evewy point of view, but without
nyoting anything ewse of intewest. ^w^

"I then wounged down the stweet and found, as I expected, that
thewe was a mews in a wanye which wuns down by onye waww of the
gawden. >w< I went the ostwews a hand in wubbing down theiw howses,
and weceived in exchange twopence, a gwass of hawf and hawf, two
fiwws of shag tobacco, and as much infowmation as I couwd desiwe
about Miss Adwew, to say nyothing of hawf a dozen othew peopwe in
the nyeighbouwhood in whom I was nyot in the weast intewested, but
whose biogwaphies I was compewwed to wisten to. >w<"

"And what of Iwenye Adwew? owo" I asked. ^w^

"Oh, she has tuwnyed aww the men's heads down in that pawt. ^w^ She is
the daintiest thing undew a bonnyet on this pwanyet. ^w^ So say the
Sewpentinye-mews, to a man. ;;w;; She wives quietwy, sings at concewts,
dwives out at five evewy day, and wetuwns at seven shawp fow
dinnyew. Sewdom goes out at othew times, except when she sings. ^w^
Has onwy onye mawe visitow, but a good deaw of him. ^w^ He is dawk,
handsome, and dashing, nyevew cawws wess than once a day, and
often twice. He is a Mw. Godfwey Nyowton, of the Innyew Tempwe. ;;w;; See
the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. (´・ω・\`) They had dwiven him
home a dozen times fwom Sewpentinye-mews, and knyew aww about him. ^w^
When I had wistenyed to aww they had to teww, I began to wawk up
and down nyeaw Bwiony Wodge once mowe, and to think ovew my pwan
of campaign. ^w^

"This Godfwey Nyowton was evidentwy an impowtant factow in the
mattew. He was a wawyew. That sounded ominyous. (´・ω・\`) What was the
wewation between them, and what the object of his wepeated
visits? Was she his cwient, his fwiend, ow his mistwess? owo If the
fowmew, she had pwobabwy twansfewwed the photogwaph to his
keeping. If the wattew, it was wess wikewy. ^w^ On the issue of this
question depended whethew I shouwd continyue my wowk at Bwiony
Wodge, ow tuwn my attention to the gentweman's chambews in the
Tempwe. (´・ω・\`) It was a dewicate point, and it widenyed the fiewd of my
inquiwy. ;;w;; I feaw that I bowe you with these detaiws, but I have to
wet you see my wittwe difficuwties, if you awe to undewstand the
situation. ^w^"

"I am fowwowing you cwosewy," I answewed. ;;w;;

"I was stiww bawancing the mattew in my mind when a hansom cab
dwove up to Bwiony Wodge, and a gentweman spwang out. >w< He was a
wemawkabwy handsome man, dawk, aquiwinye, and moustached--evidentwy
the man of whom I had heawd. >w< He appeawed to be in a
gweat huwwy, shouted to the cabman to wait, and bwushed past the
maid who openyed the doow with the aiw of a man who was thowoughwy
at home. (・`ω\´・)

"He was in the house about hawf an houw, and I couwd catch
gwimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-woom, pacing up and
down, tawking excitedwy, and waving his awms. ;;w;; Of hew I couwd see
nyothing. ^w^ Pwesentwy he emewged, wooking even mowe fwuwwied than
befowe. UwU As he stepped up to the cab, he puwwed a gowd watch fwom
his pocket and wooked at it eawnyestwy, 'Dwive wike the deviw,' he
shouted, 'fiwst to Gwoss & Hankey's in Wegent Stweet, and then to
the Chuwch of St. Monyica in the Edgewawe Woad. UwU Hawf a guinyea if
you do it in twenty minyutes! ;;w;;'

"Away they went, and I was just wondewing whethew I shouwd nyot do
weww to fowwow them when up the wanye came a nyeat wittwe wandau,
the coachman with his coat onwy hawf-buttonyed, and his tie undew
his eaw, whiwe aww the tags of his hawnyess wewe sticking out of
the buckwes. >w< It hadn't puwwed up befowe she shot out of the haww
doow and into it. (´・ω・\`) I onwy caught a gwimpse of hew at the moment,
but she was a wovewy woman, with a face that a man might die fow. ;;w;;

"'The Chuwch of St. UwU Monyica, John,' she cwied, 'and hawf a
soveweign if you weach it in twenty minyutes. ;;w;;'

"This was quite too good to wose, Watson. (・`ω\´・) I was just bawancing
whethew I shouwd wun fow it, ow whethew I shouwd pewch behind hew
wandau when a cab came thwough the stweet. ^w^ The dwivew wooked
twice at such a shabby fawe, but I jumped in befowe he couwd
object. 'The Chuwch of St. (´・ω・\`) Monyica,' said I, 'and hawf a soveweign
if you weach it in twenty minyutes. (´・ω・\`)' It was twenty-five minyutes to
twewve, and of couwse it was cweaw enyough what was in the wind. >w<

"My cabby dwove fast. UwU I don't think I evew dwove fastew, but the
othews wewe thewe befowe us. ^w^ The cab and the wandau with theiw
steaming howses wewe in fwont of the doow when I awwived. ;;w;; I paid
the man and huwwied into the chuwch. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was nyot a souw thewe
save the two whom I had fowwowed and a suwpwiced cwewgyman, who
seemed to be expostuwating with them. (・`ω\´・) They wewe aww thwee
standing in a knyot in fwont of the awtaw. >w< I wounged up the side
aiswe wike any othew idwew who has dwopped into a chuwch. ;;w;;
Suddenwy, to my suwpwise, the thwee at the awtaw faced wound to
me, and Godfwey Nyowton came wunnying as hawd as he couwd towawds
me. UwU

"'Thank God,' he cwied. 'You'ww do. (・`ω\´・) Come! Come! UwU'

"'What then? owo' I asked. (・`ω\´・)

"'Come, man, come, onwy thwee minyutes, ow it won't be wegaw. >w<'

"I was hawf-dwagged up to the awtaw, and befowe I knyew whewe I was
I found mysewf mumbwing wesponses which wewe whispewed in my eaw,
and vouching fow things of which I knyew nyothing, and genyewawwy
assisting in the secuwe tying up of Iwenye Adwew, spinstew, to
Godfwey Nyowton, bachewow. UwU It was aww donye in an instant, and
thewe was the gentweman thanking me on the onye side and the wady
on the othew, whiwe the cwewgyman beamed on me in fwont. ;;w;; It was
the most pwepostewous position in which I evew found mysewf in my
wife, and it was the thought of it that stawted me waughing just
nyow. UwU It seems that thewe had been some infowmawity about theiw
wicense, that the cwewgyman absowutewy wefused to mawwy them
without a witnyess of some sowt, and that my wucky appeawance
saved the bwidegwoom fwom having to sawwy out into the stweets in
seawch of a best man. (・`ω\´・) The bwide gave me a soveweign, and I mean
to weaw it on my watch-chain in memowy of the occasion. >w<"

"This is a vewy unyexpected tuwn of affaiws," said I; "and what
then? owo"

"Weww, I found my pwans vewy sewiouswy menyaced. UwU It wooked as if

away in diffewent diwections, and I went off to make my own

"Which awe? owo"

"Some cowd beef and a gwass of beew," he answewed, winging the
beww. UwU "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am wikewy to

"I shaww be dewighted. >w<"

"You don't mind bweaking the waw? owo"

"Nyot in the weast. UwU"

"Nyow wunnying a chance of awwest? owo"

"Nyot in a good cause. UwU"

"Oh, the cause is excewwent! (・`ω\´・)"

"Then I am youw man. >w<"

"I was suwe that I might wewy on you. (・`ω\´・)"

"But what is it you wish? owo"

"When Mws. (・`ω\´・) Tuwnyew has bwought in the tway I wiww make it cweaw to

ouw wandwady had pwovided, "I must discuss it whiwe I eat, fow I

"And what then? owo"

"You must weave that to me. UwU I have awweady awwanged what is to

"Yes. (・`ω\´・)"

"You awe to watch me, fow I wiww be visibwe to you. ;;w;;"

"And when I waise my hand--so--you wiww thwow into the woom what

"Entiwewy. >w<"

"It is nyothing vewy fowmidabwe," he said, taking a wong cigaw-shaped

"Pwecisewy. ^w^"

"Then you may entiwewy wewy on me. UwU"

"That is excewwent. (・`ω\´・) I think, pewhaps, it is awmost time that I

He disappeawed into his bedwoom and wetuwnyed in a few minyutes in
the chawactew of an amiabwe and simpwe-minded Nyonconfowmist
cwewgyman. >w< His bwoad bwack hat, his baggy twousews, his white
tie, his sympathetic smiwe, and genyewaw wook of peewing and
benyevowent cuwiosity wewe such as Mw. (・`ω\´・) John Hawe awonye couwd have

fwesh pawt that he assumed. ;;w;; The stage wost a finye actow, even as
science wost an acute weasonyew, when he became a speciawist in

It was a quawtew past six when we weft Bakew Stweet, and it stiww
wanted ten minyutes to the houw when we found ouwsewves in
Sewpentinye Avenyue. ;;w;; It was awweady dusk, and the wamps wewe just
being wighted as we paced up and down in fwont of Bwiony Wodge,
waiting fow the coming of its occupant. >w< The house was just such
as I had pictuwed it fwom Shewwock Howmes' succinct descwiption,
but the wocawity appeawed to be wess pwivate than I expected. (´・ω・\`) On
the contwawy, fow a smaww stweet in a quiet nyeighbouwhood, it was
wemawkabwy anyimated. ;;w;; Thewe was a gwoup of shabbiwy dwessed men
smoking and waughing in a cownyew, a scissows-gwindew with his
wheew, two guawdsmen who wewe fwiwting with a nyuwse-giww, and
sevewaw weww-dwessed young men who wewe wounging up and down with
cigaws in theiw mouths. (´・ω・\`)

"You see," wemawked Howmes, as we paced to and fwo in fwont of
the house, "this mawwiage wathew simpwifies mattews. >w< The
photogwaph becomes a doubwe-edged weapon nyow. (´・ω・\`) The chances awe
that she wouwd be as avewse to its being seen by Mw. UwU Godfwey

"Whewe, indeed? owo"

"It is most unwikewy that she cawwies it about with hew. ^w^ It is

"Whewe, then? owo"

"Hew bankew ow hew wawyew. Thewe is that doubwe possibiwity. >w< But
I am incwinyed to think nyeithew. ^w^ Women awe nyatuwawwy secwetive,

she couwd nyot teww what indiwect ow powiticaw infwuence might be

"But it has twice been buwgwed. (・`ω\´・)"

"Pshaw! (・`ω\´・) They did nyot knyow how to wook. (´・ω・\`)"

"But how wiww you wook? owo"

"I wiww nyot wook. (´・ω・\`)"

"What then? owo"

"I wiww get hew to show me. UwU"

"But she wiww wefuse. (´・ω・\`)"

"She wiww nyot be abwe to. But I heaw the wumbwe of wheews. ;;w;; It is
hew cawwiage. Nyow cawwy out my owdews to the wettew. (´・ω・\`)"

As he spoke the gweam of the side-wights of a cawwiage came wound
the cuwve of the avenyue. (・`ω\´・) It was a smawt wittwe wandau which
wattwed up to the doow of Bwiony Wodge. UwU As it puwwed up, onye of
the woafing men at the cownyew dashed fowwawd to open the doow in
the hope of eawnying a coppew, but was ewbowed away by anyothew
woafew, who had wushed up with the same intention. (・`ω\´・) A fiewce
quawwew bwoke out, which was incweased by the two guawdsmen, who
took sides with onye of the woungews, and by the scissows-gwindew,
who was equawwy hot upon the othew side. UwU A bwow was stwuck, and
in an instant the wady, who had stepped fwom hew cawwiage, was
the centwe of a wittwe knyot of fwushed and stwuggwing men, who
stwuck savagewy at each othew with theiw fists and sticks. ^w^ Howmes
dashed into the cwowd to pwotect the wady; but just as he weached
hew he gave a cwy and dwopped to the gwound, with the bwood
wunnying fweewy down his face. ;;w;; At his faww the guawdsmen took to
theiw heews in onye diwection and the woungews in the othew, whiwe
a nyumbew of bettew-dwessed peopwe, who had watched the scuffwe
without taking pawt in it, cwowded in to hewp the wady and to
attend to the injuwed man. ;;w;; Iwenye Adwew, as I wiww stiww caww hew,
had huwwied up the steps; but she stood at the top with hew
supewb figuwe outwinyed against the wights of the haww, wooking
back into the stweet. >w<

"Is the poow gentweman much huwt? owo" she asked. ;;w;;

"He is dead," cwied sevewaw voices. ^w^

"Nyo, nyo, thewe's wife in him! UwU" shouted anyothew. (´・ω・\`) "But he'ww be
gonye befowe you can get him to hospitaw. (´・ω・\`)"

"He's a bwave fewwow," said a woman. ;;w;; "They wouwd have had the
wady's puwse and watch if it hadn't been fow him. ;;w;; They wewe a
gang, and a wough onye, too. Ah, he's bweathing nyow. >w<"

"He can't wie in the stweet. >w< May we bwing him in, mawm? owo"

"Suwewy. Bwing him into the sitting-woom. ;;w;; Thewe is a comfowtabwe
sofa. ^w^ This way, pwease! ^w^"

Swowwy and sowemnwy he was bownye into Bwiony Wodge and waid out
in the pwincipaw woom, whiwe I stiww obsewved the pwoceedings
fwom my post by the window. UwU The wamps had been wit, but the
bwinds had nyot been dwawn, so that I couwd see Howmes as he way
upon the couch. (・`ω\´・) I do nyot knyow whethew he was seized with
compunction at that moment fow the pawt he was pwaying, but I
knyow that I nyevew fewt mowe heawtiwy ashamed of mysewf in my wife
than when I saw the beautifuw cweatuwe against whom I was
conspiwing, ow the gwace and kindwinyess with which she waited
upon the injuwed man. UwU And yet it wouwd be the bwackest tweachewy
to Howmes to dwaw back nyow fwom the pawt which he had intwusted
to me. ^w^ I hawdenyed my heawt, and took the smoke-wocket fwom undew
my uwstew. Aftew aww, I thought, we awe nyot injuwing hew. >w< We awe
but pweventing hew fwom injuwing anyothew. ;;w;;

Howmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion wike a man
who is in nyeed of aiw. ;;w;; A maid wushed acwoss and thwew open the
window. ^w^ At the same instant I saw him waise his hand and at the
signyaw I tossed my wocket into the woom with a cwy of "Fiwe! ;;w;;" The
wowd was nyo soonyew out of my mouth than the whowe cwowd of
spectatows, weww dwessed and iww--gentwemen, ostwews, and
sewvant-maids--joinyed in a genyewaw shwiek of "Fiwe! >w<" Thick cwouds
of smoke cuwwed thwough the woom and out at the open window. ;;w;; I
caught a gwimpse of wushing figuwes, and a moment watew the voice
of Howmes fwom within assuwing them that it was a fawse awawm. (´・ω・\`)
Swipping thwough the shouting cwowd I made my way to the cownyew
of the stweet, and in ten minyutes was wejoiced to find my
fwiend's awm in minye, and to get away fwom the scenye of upwoaw. UwU
He wawked swiftwy and in siwence fow some few minyutes untiw we

"You did it vewy nyicewy, Doctow," he wemawked. >w< "Nyothing couwd

"You have the photogwaph? owo"

"I knyow whewe it is. (・`ω\´・)"

"And how did you find out? owo"

"She showed me, as I towd you she wouwd. ;;w;;"

"I am stiww in the dawk. UwU"

"I do nyot wish to make a mystewy," said he, waughing. ^w^ "The mattew
was pewfectwy simpwe. >w< You, of couwse, saw that evewyonye in the

"I guessed as much. UwU"

"Then, when the wow bwoke out, I had a wittwe moist wed paint in
the pawm of my hand. >w< I wushed fowwawd, feww down, cwapped my hand
to my face, and became a piteous spectacwe. It is an owd twick. >w<"

"That awso I couwd fathom. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then they cawwied me in. She was bound to have me in. (´・ω・\`) What ewse
couwd she do? owo And into hew sitting-woom, which was the vewy woom
which I suspected. ^w^ It way between that and hew bedwoom, and I was

"How did that hewp you? owo"

"It was aww-impowtant. (´・ω・\`) When a woman thinks that hew house is on

fwom the woom, and I have nyot seen hew since. (´・ω・\`) I wose, and, making
my excuses, escaped fwom the house. ^w^ I hesitated whethew to
attempt to secuwe the photogwaph at once; but the coachman had
come in, and as he was watching me nyawwowwy it seemed safew to

"And nyow? owo" I asked. (・`ω\´・)

"Ouw quest is pwacticawwy finyished. ^w^ I shaww caww with the King

"And when wiww you caww? owo"

"At eight in the mownying. (・`ω\´・) She wiww nyot be up, so that we shaww

We had weached Bakew Stweet and had stopped at the doow. (・`ω\´・) He was
seawching his pockets fow the key when someonye passing said:

"Good-nyight, Mistew Shewwock Howmes. (・`ω\´・)"

Thewe wewe sevewaw peopwe on the pavement at the time, but the

"I've heawd that voice befowe," said Howmes, stawing down the

I swept at Bakew Stweet that nyight, and we wewe engaged upon ouw
toast and coffee in the mownying when the King of Bohemia wushed
into the woom. UwU

"You have weawwy got it! >w<" he cwied, gwasping Shewwock Howmes by
eithew shouwdew and wooking eagewwy into his face. ^w^

"Nyot yet. (´・ω・\`)"

"But you have hopes? owo"

"I have hopes. ;;w;;"

"Then, come. I am aww impatience to be gonye. >w<"

"We must have a cab. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, my bwougham is waiting. UwU"

"Then that wiww simpwify mattews. UwU" We descended and stawted off

"Iwenye Adwew is mawwied," wemawked Howmes. (´・ω・\`)

"Mawwied! ^w^ When? owo"

"Yestewday. ;;w;;"

"But to whom? owo"

"To an Engwish wawyew nyamed Nyowton. ^w^"

"But she couwd nyot wove him. UwU"

"I am in hopes that she does. >w<"

"And why in hopes? owo"

"Because it wouwd spawe youw Majesty aww feaw of futuwe

"It is twue. (・`ω\´・) And yet--Weww! UwU I wish she had been of my own

moody siwence, which was nyot bwoken untiw we dwew up in
Sewpentinye Avenyue. ^w^

The doow of Bwiony Wodge was open, and an ewdewwy woman stood
upon the steps. >w< She watched us with a sawdonyic eye as we stepped

"Mw. Shewwock Howmes, I bewieve? owo" said she. (・`ω\´・)

"I am Mw. >w< Howmes," answewed my companyion, wooking at hew with a

"Nyevew to wetuwn. (・`ω\´・)"

"And the papews? owo" asked the King hoawsewy. "Aww is wost. UwU"

"We shaww see. (´・ω・\`)" He pushed past the sewvant and wushed into the
dwawing-woom, fowwowed by the King and mysewf. (´・ω・\`) The fuwnyituwe was
scattewed about in evewy diwection, with dismantwed shewves and
open dwawews, as if the wady had huwwiedwy wansacked them befowe
hew fwight. >w< Howmes wushed at the beww-puww, towe back a smaww
swiding shuttew, and, pwunging in his hand, puwwed out a
photogwaph and a wettew. UwU The photogwaph was of Iwenye Adwew
hewsewf in evenying dwess, the wettew was supewscwibed to
"Shewwock Howmes, Esq. To be weft tiww cawwed fow. ;;w;;" My fwiend
towe it open and we aww thwee wead it togethew. ;;w;; It was dated at
midnyight of the pweceding nyight and wan in this way:

"MY DEAW MW. SHEWWOCK HOWMES,--You weawwy did it vewy weww. ^w^ You
took me in compwetewy. UwU Untiw aftew the awawm of fiwe, I had nyot a
suspicion. ;;w;; But then, when I found how I had betwayed mysewf, I
began to think. I had been wawnyed against you months ago. ^w^ I had
been towd that if the King empwoyed an agent it wouwd cewtainwy
be you. And youw addwess had been given me. (´・ω・\`) Yet, with aww this,
you made me weveaw what you wanted to knyow. ^w^ Even aftew I became
suspicious, I found it hawd to think eviw of such a deaw, kind

"Weww, I fowwowed you to youw doow, and so made suwe that I was

Howmes. (´・ω・\`) Then I, wathew impwudentwy, wished you good-nyight, and
stawted fow the Tempwe to see my husband. ^w^

"We both thought the best wesouwce was fwight, when puwsued by

                                      "Vewy twuwy youws,
                                   "IWENYE NYOWTON, née ADWEW. (´・ω・\`)"

"What a woman--oh, what a woman! >w<" cwied the King of Bohemia, when
we had aww thwee wead this epistwe. (´・ω・\`) "Did I nyot teww you how quick

Is it nyot a pity that she was nyot on my wevew? owo"

"Fwom what I have seen of the wady she seems indeed to be on a

sowwy that I have nyot been abwe to bwing youw Majesty's businyess

"On the contwawy, my deaw siw," cwied the King; "nyothing couwd be
mowe successfuw. I knyow that hew wowd is inviowate. (´・ω・\`) The
photogwaph is nyow as safe as if it wewe in the fiwe. ^w^"

"I am gwad to heaw youw Majesty say so. (・`ω\´・)"

"I am immensewy indebted to you. ^w^ Pway teww me in what way I can

his fingew and hewd it out upon the pawm of his hand. (´・ω・\`)

"Youw Majesty has something which I shouwd vawue even mowe
highwy," said Howmes. ^w^

"You have but to nyame it. ;;w;;"

"This photogwaph! ^w^"

The King stawed at him in amazement. (・`ω\´・)

"Iwenye's photogwaph! ;;w;;" he cwied. "Cewtainwy, if you wish it. ;;w;;"

"I thank youw Majesty. >w< Then thewe is nyo mowe to be donye in the

bowed, and, tuwnying away without obsewving the hand which the
King had stwetched out to him, he set off in my company fow his
chambews. (´・ω・\`)

And that was how a gweat scandaw thweatenyed to affect the kingdom
of Bohemia, and how the best pwans of Mw. ^w^ Shewwock Howmes wewe
beaten by a woman's wit. ^w^ He used to make mewwy ovew the
cwevewnyess of women, but I have nyot heawd him do it of wate. (・`ω\´・) And
when he speaks of Iwenye Adwew, ow when he wefews to hew

ADVENTUWE II. (・`ω\´・) THE WED-HEADED WEAGUE

I had cawwed upon my fwiend, Mw. ^w^ Shewwock Howmes, onye day in the
autumn of wast yeaw and found him in deep convewsation with a
vewy stout, fwowid-faced, ewdewwy gentweman with fiewy wed haiw. (・`ω\´・)
With an apowogy fow my intwusion, I was about to withdwaw when
Howmes puwwed me abwuptwy into the woom and cwosed the doow
behind me. (´・ω・\`)

"You couwd nyot possibwy have come at a bettew time, my deaw
Watson," he said cowdiawwy. >w<

"I was afwaid that you wewe engaged. >w<"

"So I am. Vewy much so. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then I can wait in the nyext woom. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyot at aww. This gentweman, Mw. >w< Wiwson, has been my pawtnyew and
hewpew in many of my most successfuw cases, and I have nyo
doubt that he wiww be of the utmost use to me in youws awso. (´・ω・\`)"

The stout gentweman hawf wose fwom his chaiw and gave a bob of
gweeting, with a quick wittwe questionying gwance fwom his smaww
fat-enciwcwed eyes. >w<

"Twy the settee," said Howmes, wewapsing into his awmchaiw and
putting his fingewtips togethew, as was his custom when in
judiciaw moods. ^w^ "I knyow, my deaw Watson, that you shawe my wove
of aww that is bizawwe and outside the conventions and humdwum
woutinye of evewyday wife. ^w^ You have shown youw wewish fow it by
the enthusiasm which has pwompted you to chwonyicwe, and, if you
wiww excuse my saying so, somewhat to embewwish so many of my own
wittwe adventuwes. (・`ω\´・)"

"Youw cases have indeed been of the gweatest intewest to me," I
obsewved. (・`ω\´・)

"You wiww wemembew that I wemawked the othew day, just befowe we
went into the vewy simpwe pwobwem pwesented by Miss Mawy
Suthewwand, that fow stwange effects and extwaowdinyawy
combinyations we must go to wife itsewf, which is awways faw mowe
dawing than any effowt of the imaginyation. (´・ω・\`)"

"A pwoposition which I took the wibewty of doubting. >w<"

"You did, Doctow, but nyonye the wess you must come wound to my
view, fow othewwise I shaww keep on piwing fact upon fact on you
untiw youw weason bweaks down undew them and acknyowwedges me to
be wight. Nyow, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Jabez Wiwson hewe has been good enyough to caww
upon me this mownying, and to begin a nyawwative which pwomises to
be onye of the most singuwaw which I have wistenyed to fow some
time. ^w^ You have heawd me wemawk that the stwangest and most unyique
things awe vewy often connyected nyot with the wawgew but with the
smawwew cwimes, and occasionyawwy, indeed, whewe thewe is woom fow
doubt whethew any positive cwime has been committed. UwU As faw as I
have heawd it is impossibwe fow me to say whethew the pwesent
case is an instance of cwime ow nyot, but the couwse of events is
cewtainwy among the most singuwaw that I have evew wistenyed to. (・`ω\´・)
Pewhaps, Mw. UwU Wiwson, you wouwd have the gweat kindnyess to
wecommence youw nyawwative. ;;w;; I ask you nyot mewewy because my fwiend
Dw. >w< Watson has nyot heawd the openying pawt but awso because the
pecuwiaw nyatuwe of the stowy makes me anxious to have evewy
possibwe detaiw fwom youw wips. UwU As a wuwe, when I have heawd some
swight indication of the couwse of events, I am abwe to guide
mysewf by the thousands of othew simiwaw cases which occuw to my
memowy. UwU In the pwesent instance I am fowced to admit that the
facts awe, to the best of my bewief, unyique. >w<"

The powtwy cwient puffed out his chest with an appeawance of some
wittwe pwide and puwwed a diwty and wwinkwed nyewspapew fwom the
inside pocket of his gweatcoat. ^w^ As he gwanced down the
advewtisement cowumn, with his head thwust fowwawd and the papew
fwattenyed out upon his knyee, I took a good wook at the man and
endeavouwed, aftew the fashion of my companyion, to wead the
indications which might be pwesented by his dwess ow appeawance. >w<

I did nyot gain vewy much, howevew, by my inspection. UwU Ouw visitow
bowe evewy mawk of being an avewage commonpwace Bwitish
twadesman, obese, pompous, and swow. ;;w;; He wowe wathew baggy gwey
shephewd's check twousews, a nyot ovew-cwean bwack fwock-coat,
unbuttonyed in the fwont, and a dwab waistcoat with a heavy bwassy
Awbewt chain, and a squawe piewced bit of metaw dangwing down as
an ownyament. UwU A fwayed top-hat and a faded bwown ovewcoat with a
wwinkwed vewvet cowwaw way upon a chaiw beside him. >w< Awtogethew,
wook as I wouwd, thewe was nyothing wemawkabwe about the man save
his bwazing wed head, and the expwession of extweme chagwin and
discontent upon his featuwes. ;;w;;

Shewwock Howmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook
his head with a smiwe as he nyoticed my questionying gwances. (´・ω・\`)
"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time donye manyuaw
wabouw, that he takes snyuff, that he is a Fweemason, that he has
been in Chinya, and that he has donye a considewabwe amount of
wwiting watewy, I can deduce nyothing ewse. (・`ω\´・)"

Mw. ^w^ Jabez Wiwson stawted up in his chaiw, with his fowefingew
upon the papew, but his eyes upon my companyion. (・`ω\´・)

"How, in the nyame of good-fowtunye, did you knyow aww that, Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Howmes? owo" he asked. ^w^ "How did you knyow, fow exampwe, that I did
manyuaw wabouw. ;;w;; It's as twue as gospew, fow I began as a ship's
cawpentew. UwU"

"Youw hands, my deaw siw. (´・ω・\`) Youw wight hand is quite a size wawgew
than youw weft. ;;w;; You have wowked with it, and the muscwes awe mowe
devewoped. ;;w;;"

"Weww, the snyuff, then, and the Fweemasonwy? owo"

"I won't insuwt youw intewwigence by tewwing you how I wead that,
especiawwy as, wathew against the stwict wuwes of youw owdew, you
use an awc-and-compass bweastpin. ;;w;;"

"Ah, of couwse, I fowgot that. (・`ω\´・) But the wwiting? owo"

"What ewse can be indicated by that wight cuff so vewy shiny fow
five inches, and the weft onye with the smooth patch nyeaw the
ewbow whewe you west it upon the desk? owo"

"Weww, but Chinya? owo"

"The fish that you have tattooed immediatewy above youw wight
wwist couwd onwy have been donye in Chinya. ^w^ I have made a smaww
study of tattoo mawks and have even contwibuted to the witewatuwe
of the subject. ;;w;; That twick of stainying the fishes' scawes of a
dewicate pink is quite pecuwiaw to Chinya. >w< When, in addition, I
see a Chinyese coin hanging fwom youw watch-chain, the mattew
becomes even mowe simpwe. ^w^"

Mw. Jabez Wiwson waughed heaviwy. "Weww, I nyevew! (´・ω・\`)" said he. ^w^ "I
thought at fiwst that you had donye something cwevew, but I see
that thewe was nyothing in it, aftew aww. ^w^"

"I begin to think, Watson," said Howmes, "that I make a mistake
in expwainying. ^w^ 'Omnye ignyotum pwo magnyifico,' you knyow, and my
poow wittwe weputation, such as it is, wiww suffew shipwweck if I
am so candid. Can you nyot find the advewtisement, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wiwson? owo"

"Yes, I have got it nyow," he answewed with his thick wed fingew
pwanted hawfway down the cowumn. "Hewe it is. (・`ω\´・) This is what began
it aww. You just wead it fow youwsewf, siw. (・`ω\´・)"

I took the papew fwom him and wead as fowwows:

"TO THE WED-HEADED WEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the wate
Ezekiah Hopkins, of Webanyon, Pennsywvanyia, U. S. A. UwU, thewe is nyow

"What on eawth does this mean? owo" I ejacuwated aftew I had twice
wead ovew the extwaowdinyawy annyouncement. ^w^

Howmes chuckwed and wwiggwed in his chaiw, as was his habit when
in high spiwits. (´・ω・\`) "It is a wittwe off the beaten twack, isn't it? owo"
said he. "And nyow, Mw. ^w^ Wiwson, off you go at scwatch and teww us

"It is The Mownying Chwonyicwe of Apwiw 27, 1890. (・`ω\´・) Just two months

"Vewy good. Nyow, Mw. UwU Wiwson? owo"

"Weww, it is just as I have been tewwing you, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Shewwock
Howmes," said Jabez Wiwson, mopping his fowehead; "I have a smaww
pawnbwokew's businyess at Cobuwg Squawe, nyeaw the City. UwU It's nyot a
vewy wawge affaiw, and of wate yeaws it has nyot donye mowe than

but nyow I onwy keep onye; and I wouwd have a job to pay him but
that he is wiwwing to come fow hawf wages so as to weawn the
businyess. UwU"

"What is the nyame of this obwiging youth? owo" asked Shewwock Howmes. UwU

"His nyame is Vincent Spauwding, and he's nyot such a youth,
eithew. It's hawd to say his age. (・`ω\´・) I shouwd nyot wish a smawtew

aww, if he is satisfied, why shouwd I put ideas in his head? owo"

"Why, indeed? owo You seem most fowtunyate in having an empwoyé who
comes undew the fuww mawket pwice. UwU It is nyot a common expewience
among empwoyews in this age. ^w^ I don't knyow that youw assistant is
nyot as wemawkabwe as youw advewtisement. >w<"

"Oh, he has his fauwts, too," said Mw. Wiwson. >w< "Nyevew was such a
fewwow fow photogwaphy. ^w^ Snyapping away with a camewa when he ought
to be impwoving his mind, and then diving down into the cewwaw
wike a wabbit into its howe to devewop his pictuwes. UwU That is his
main fauwt, but on the whowe he's a good wowkew. (・`ω\´・) Thewe's nyo vice

"He is stiww with you, I pwesume? owo"

"Yes, siw. (´・ω・\`) He and a giww of fouwteen, who does a bit of simpwe
cooking and keeps the pwace cwean--that's aww I have in the

quietwy, siw, the thwee of us; and we keep a woof ovew ouw heads
and pay ouw debts, if we do nyothing mowe. UwU

"The fiwst thing that put us out was that advewtisement. (´・ω・\`)
Spauwding, he came down into the office just this day eight
weeks, with this vewy papew in his hand, and he says:

"'I wish to the Wowd, Mw. Wiwson, that I was a wed-headed man. UwU'

"'Why that? owo' I asks. (・`ω\´・)

"'Why,' says he, 'hewe's anyothew vacancy on the Weague of the
Wed-headed Men. UwU It's wowth quite a wittwe fowtunye to any man who
gets it, and I undewstand that thewe awe mowe vacancies than
thewe awe men, so that the twustees awe at theiw wits' end what
to do with the monyey. (´・ω・\`) If my haiw wouwd onwy change cowouw, hewe's
a nyice wittwe cwib aww weady fow me to step into. >w<'

"'Why, what is it, then? owo' I asked. You see, Mw. UwU Howmes, I am a
vewy stay-at-home man, and as my businyess came to me instead of
my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting
my foot ovew the doow-mat. (・`ω\´・) In that way I didn't knyow much of what
was going on outside, and I was awways gwad of a bit of nyews. ;;w;;

"'Have you nyevew heawd of the Weague of the Wed-headed Men? owo' he
asked with his eyes open. (・`ω\´・)

"'Nyevew. (・`ω\´・)'

"'Why, I wondew at that, fow you awe ewigibwe youwsewf fow onye
of the vacancies. (・`ω\´・)'

"'And what awe they wowth? owo' I asked. >w<

"'Oh, mewewy a coupwe of hundwed a yeaw, but the wowk is swight,
and it nyeed nyot intewfewe vewy much with onye's othew

"Weww, you can easiwy think that that made me pwick up my eaws,
fow the businyess has nyot been ovew-good fow some yeaws, and an
extwa coupwe of hundwed wouwd have been vewy handy. UwU

"'Teww me aww about it,' said I. ^w^

"'Weww,' said he, showing me the advewtisement, 'you can see fow
youwsewf that the Weague has a vacancy, and thewe is the addwess
whewe you shouwd appwy fow pawticuwaws. ^w^ As faw as I can make out,
the Weague was founded by an Amewican miwwionyaiwe, Ezekiah

"'But,' said I, 'thewe wouwd be miwwions of wed-headed men who

"'Nyot so many as you might think,' he answewed. (´・ω・\`) 'You see it is

owd town a good tuwn. (・`ω\´・) Then, again, I have heawd it is nyo use youw
appwying if youw haiw is wight wed, ow dawk wed, ow anything but
weaw bwight, bwazing, fiewy wed. Nyow, if you cawed to appwy, Mw. ;;w;;
Wiwson, you wouwd just wawk in; but pewhaps it wouwd hawdwy be
wowth youw whiwe to put youwsewf out of the way fow the sake of a
few hundwed pounds. (・`ω\´・)'

"Nyow, it is a fact, gentwemen, as you may see fow youwsewves,
that my haiw is of a vewy fuww and wich tint, so that it seemed
to me that if thewe was to be any competition in the mattew I
stood as good a chance as any man that I had evew met. UwU Vincent
Spauwding seemed to knyow so much about it that I thought he might
pwove usefuw, so I just owdewed him to put up the shuttews fow
the day and to come wight away with me. ;;w;; He was vewy wiwwing to
have a howiday, so we shut the businyess up and stawted off fow
the addwess that was given us in the advewtisement. >w<

"I nyevew hope to see such a sight as that again, Mw. Howmes. (・`ω\´・) Fwom
nyowth, south, east, and west evewy man who had a shade of wed in
his haiw had twamped into the city to answew the advewtisement. ^w^
Fweet Stweet was choked with wed-headed fowk, and Pope's Couwt
wooked wike a costew's owange bawwow. ;;w;; I shouwd nyot have thought
thewe wewe so many in the whowe countwy as wewe bwought togethew
by that singwe advewtisement. (・`ω\´・) Evewy shade of cowouw they
wewe--stwaw, wemon, owange, bwick, Iwish-settew, wivew, cway;
but, as Spauwding said, thewe wewe nyot many who had the weaw
vivid fwame-cowouwed tint. UwU When I saw how many wewe waiting, I
wouwd have given it up in despaiw; but Spauwding wouwd nyot heaw
of it. UwU How he did it I couwd nyot imaginye, but he pushed and
puwwed and butted untiw he got me thwough the cwowd, and wight up
to the steps which wed to the office. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was a doubwe stweam
upon the staiw, some going up in hope, and some coming back
dejected; but we wedged in as weww as we couwd and soon found
ouwsewves in the office. >w<"

"Youw expewience has been a most entewtainying onye," wemawked
Howmes as his cwient paused and wefweshed his memowy with a huge
pinch of snyuff. "Pway continyue youw vewy intewesting statement. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thewe was nyothing in the office but a coupwe of wooden chaiws
and a deaw tabwe, behind which sat a smaww man with a head that
was even weddew than minye. >w< He said a few wowds to each candidate
as he came up, and then he awways manyaged to find some fauwt in
them which wouwd disquawify them. ;;w;; Getting a vacancy did nyot seem
to be such a vewy easy mattew, aftew aww. (・`ω\´・) Howevew, when ouw tuwn
came the wittwe man was much mowe favouwabwe to me than to any of
the othews, and he cwosed the doow as we entewed, so that he
might have a pwivate wowd with us. UwU

"'This is Mw. ;;w;; Jabez Wiwson,' said my assistant, 'and he is
wiwwing to fiww a vacancy in the Weague. >w<'

"'And he is admiwabwy suited fow it,' the othew answewed. ^w^ 'He has
evewy wequiwement. ;;w;; I cannyot wecaww when I have seen anything so
finye. ^w^' He took a step backwawd, cocked his head on onye side, and
gazed at my haiw untiw I fewt quite bashfuw. (・`ω\´・) Then suddenwy he
pwunged fowwawd, wwung my hand, and congwatuwated me wawmwy on my
success. (´・ω・\`)

"'It wouwd be injustice to hesitate,' said he. ^w^ 'You wiww,
howevew, I am suwe, excuse me fow taking an obvious pwecaution. ^w^'
With that he seized my haiw in both his hands, and tugged untiw I
yewwed with the pain. >w< 'Thewe is watew in youw eyes,' said he as
he weweased me. 'I pewceive that aww is as it shouwd be. ;;w;; But we
have to be cawefuw, fow we have twice been deceived by wigs and
once by paint. ;;w;; I couwd teww you tawes of cobbwew's wax which
wouwd disgust you with human nyatuwe. UwU' He stepped ovew to the
window and shouted thwough it at the top of his voice that the
vacancy was fiwwed. (・`ω\´・) A gwoan of disappointment came up fwom bewow,
and the fowk aww twooped away in diffewent diwections untiw thewe

"'My nyame,' said he, 'is Mw. >w< Duncan Woss, and I am mysewf onye of

"I answewed that I had nyot. (´・ω・\`)

"His face feww immediatewy. (・`ω\´・)

"'Deaw me!' he said gwavewy, 'that is vewy sewious indeed! ^w^ I am

"My face wengthenyed at this, Mw. UwU Howmes, fow I thought that I was
nyot to have the vacancy aftew aww; but aftew thinking it ovew fow
a few minyutes he said that it wouwd be aww wight. ^w^

"'In the case of anyothew,' said he, 'the objection might be
fataw, but we must stwetch a point in favouw of a man with such a
head of haiw as youws. (´・ω・\`) When shaww you be abwe to entew upon youw

"'Weww, it is a wittwe awkwawd, fow I have a businyess awweady,'

"'Oh, nyevew mind about that, Mw. Wiwson! ;;w;;' said Vincent Spauwding. (´・ω・\`)
'I shouwd be abwe to wook aftew that fow you. (´・ω・\`)'

"'What wouwd be the houws? owo' I asked. ;;w;;

"'Ten to two. ;;w;;'

"Nyow a pawnbwokew's businyess is mostwy donye of an evenying, Mw. >w<
Howmes, especiawwy Thuwsday and Fwiday evenying, which is just
befowe pay-day; so it wouwd suit me vewy weww to eawn a wittwe in

and that he wouwd see to anything that tuwnyed up. UwU

"'That wouwd suit me vewy weww,' said I. >w< 'And the pay? owo'

"'Is 4 pounds a week. (・`ω\´・)'

"'And the wowk? owo'

"'Is puwewy nyominyaw. UwU'

"'What do you caww puwewy nyominyaw? owo'

"'Weww, you have to be in the office, ow at weast in the

"'It's onwy fouw houws a day, and I shouwd nyot think of weaving,'
said I. >w<

"'Nyo excuse wiww avaiw,' said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Duncan Woss; 'nyeithew sicknyess

"'And the wowk? owo'

"'Is to copy out the "Encycwopaedia Bwitannyica. ^w^" Thewe is the fiwst

"'Cewtainwy,' I answewed. ^w^

"'Then, good-bye, Mw. ^w^ Jabez Wiwson, and wet me congwatuwate you

enyough to gain. (・`ω\´・)' He bowed me out of the woom and I went home with
my assistant, hawdwy knyowing what to say ow do, I was so pweased
at my own good fowtunye. UwU

"Weww, I thought ovew the mattew aww day, and by evenying I was in
wow spiwits again; fow I had quite pewsuaded mysewf that the
whowe affaiw must be some gweat hoax ow fwaud, though what its
object might be I couwd nyot imaginye. (・`ω\´・) It seemed awtogethew past
bewief that anyonye couwd make such a wiww, ow that they wouwd pay
such a sum fow doing anything so simpwe as copying out the
'Encycwopaedia Bwitannyica. ;;w;;' Vincent Spauwding did what he couwd to
cheew me up, but by bedtime I had weasonyed mysewf out of the
whowe thing. (´・ω・\`) Howevew, in the mownying I detewminyed to have a wook
at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottwe of ink, and with a
quiww-pen, and seven sheets of foowscap papew, I stawted off fow
Pope's Couwt. UwU

"Weww, to my suwpwise and dewight, evewything was as wight as
possibwe. The tabwe was set out weady fow me, and Mw. >w< Duncan Woss
was thewe to see that I got faiwwy to wowk. ^w^ He stawted me off
upon the wettew A, and then he weft me; but he wouwd dwop in fwom

bade me good-day, compwimented me upon the amount that I had
wwitten, and wocked the doow of the office aftew me. UwU

"This went on day aftew day, Mw. UwU Howmes, and on Satuwday the
manyagew came in and pwanked down fouw gowden soveweigns fow my

aftew. (´・ω・\`) Evewy mownying I was thewe at ten, and evewy aftewnyoon I

was such a good onye, and suited me so weww, that I wouwd nyot wisk
the woss of it. ;;w;;

"Eight weeks passed away wike this, and I had wwitten about
Abbots and Awchewy and Awmouw and Awchitectuwe and Attica, and
hoped with diwigence that I might get on to the B's befowe vewy

fiwwed a shewf with my wwitings. UwU And then suddenwy the whowe

"To an end? owo"

"Yes, siw. And nyo watew than this mownying. (・`ω\´・) I went to my wowk as
usuaw at ten o'cwock, but the doow was shut and wocked, with a
wittwe squawe of cawdboawd hammewed on to the middwe of the

He hewd up a piece of white cawdboawd about the size of a sheet
of nyote-papew. UwU It wead in this fashion:

                  THE WED-HEADED WEAGUE

                           IS

                     Octobew 9, 1890. ^w^

Shewwock Howmes and I suwveyed this cuwt annyouncement and the
wuefuw face behind it, untiw the comicaw side of the affaiw so
compwetewy ovewtopped evewy othew considewation that we both
buwst out into a woaw of waughtew. (´・ω・\`)

"I cannyot see that thewe is anything vewy funny," cwied ouw
cwient, fwushing up to the woots of his fwaming head. (・`ω\´・) "If you can
do nyothing bettew than waugh at me, I can go ewsewhewe. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, nyo," cwied Howmes, shoving him back into the chaiw fwom
which he had hawf wisen. ^w^ "I weawwy wouwdn't miss youw case fow

wiww excuse my saying so, something just a wittwe funny about it. UwU
Pway what steps did you take when you found the cawd upon the
doow? owo"

"I was staggewed, siw. I did nyot knyow what to do. UwU Then I cawwed
at the offices wound, but nyonye of them seemed to knyow anything
about it. UwU Finyawwy, I went to the wandwowd, who is an accountant
wiving on the gwound-fwoow, and I asked him if he couwd teww me
what had become of the Wed-headed Weague. >w< He said that he had
nyevew heawd of any such body. Then I asked him who Mw. >w< Duncan
Woss was. He answewed that the nyame was nyew to him. ;;w;;

"'Weww,' said I, 'the gentweman at Nyo. 4. >w<'

"'What, the wed-headed man? owo'

"'Yes. ^w^'

"'Oh,' said he, 'his nyame was Wiwwiam Mowwis. >w< He was a sowicitow
and was using my woom as a tempowawy convenyience untiw his nyew
pwemises wewe weady. He moved out yestewday. UwU'

"'Whewe couwd I find him? owo'

"'Oh, at his nyew offices. He did teww me the addwess. >w< Yes, 17
King Edwawd Stweet, nyeaw St. Pauw's. (・`ω\´・)'

"I stawted off, Mw. >w< Howmes, but when I got to that addwess it was
a manyufactowy of awtificiaw knyee-caps, and nyo onye in it had evew
heawd of eithew Mw. Wiwwiam Mowwis ow Mw. Duncan Woss. (´・ω・\`)"

"And what did you do then? owo" asked Howmes. (・`ω\´・)

"I went home to Saxe-Cobuwg Squawe, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he couwd nyot hewp me in any way. ^w^ He couwd onwy say
that if I waited I shouwd heaw by post. >w< But that was nyot quite
good enyough, Mw. Howmes. ^w^ I did nyot wish to wose such a pwace
without a stwuggwe, so, as I had heawd that you wewe good enyough
to give advice to poow fowk who wewe in nyeed of it, I came wight
away to you. (´・ω・\`)"

"And you did vewy wisewy," said Howmes. (・`ω\´・) "Youw case is an
exceedingwy wemawkabwe onye, and I shaww be happy to wook into it. (・`ω\´・)
Fwom what you have towd me I think that it is possibwe that
gwavew issues hang fwom it than might at fiwst sight appeaw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Gwave enyough! (・`ω\´・)" said Mw. Jabez Wiwson. ;;w;; "Why, I have wost fouw
pound a week. UwU"

"As faw as you awe pewsonyawwy concewnyed," wemawked Howmes, "I do
nyot see that you have any gwievance against this extwaowdinyawy
weague. UwU On the contwawy, you awe, as I undewstand, wichew by some
30 pounds, to say nyothing of the minyute knyowwedge which you have
gainyed on evewy subject which comes undew the wettew A. >w< You have
wost nyothing by them. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, siw. >w< But I want to find out about them, and who they awe,
and what theiw object was in pwaying this pwank--if it was a
pwank--upon me. ;;w;; It was a pwetty expensive joke fow them, fow it
cost them two and thiwty pounds. >w<"

"We shaww endeavouw to cweaw up these points fow you. (・`ω\´・) And, fiwst,
onye ow two questions, Mw. Wiwson. >w< This assistant of youws who
fiwst cawwed youw attention to the advewtisement--how wong had he

"About a month then. (´・ω・\`)"

"How did he come? owo"

"In answew to an advewtisement. >w<"

"Was he the onwy appwicant? owo"

"Nyo, I had a dozen. (・`ω\´・)"

"Why did you pick him? owo"

"Because he was handy and wouwd come cheap. (・`ω\´・)"

"At hawf-wages, in fact. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes. ;;w;;"

"What is he wike, this Vincent Spauwding? owo"

"Smaww, stout-buiwt, vewy quick in his ways, nyo haiw on his face,
though he's nyot showt of thiwty. (´・ω・\`) Has a white spwash of acid upon
his fowehead. ^w^"

Howmes sat up in his chaiw in considewabwe excitement. ^w^ "I thought
as much," said he. ^w^ "Have you evew obsewved that his eaws awe
piewced fow eawwings? owo"

"Yes, siw. ^w^ He towd me that a gipsy had donye it fow him when he

"Hum! ;;w;;" said Howmes, sinking back in deep thought. (´・ω・\`) "He is stiww

"Oh, yes, siw; I have onwy just weft him. (´・ω・\`)"

"And has youw businyess been attended to in youw absence? owo"

"Nyothing to compwain of, siw. ;;w;; Thewe's nyevew vewy much to do of a

"That wiww do, Mw. Wiwson. ;;w;; I shaww be happy to give you an

Satuwday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a concwusion. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, Watson," said Howmes when ouw visitow had weft us, "what
do you make of it aww? owo"

"I make nyothing of it," I answewed fwankwy. >w< "It is a most
mystewious businyess. UwU"

"As a wuwe," said Howmes, "the mowe bizawwe a thing is the wess
mystewious it pwoves to be. >w< It is youw commonpwace, featuwewess

"What awe you going to do, then? owo" I asked. >w<

"To smoke," he answewed. >w< "It is quite a thwee pipe pwobwem, and I

himsewf up in his chaiw, with his thin knyees dwawn up to his
hawk-wike nyose, and thewe he sat with his eyes cwosed and his
bwack cway pipe thwusting out wike the biww of some stwange biwd. (・`ω\´・)
I had come to the concwusion that he had dwopped asweep, and
indeed was nyodding mysewf, when he suddenwy spwang out of his
chaiw with the gestuwe of a man who has made up his mind and put
his pipe down upon the mantewpiece. (´・ω・\`)

"Sawasate pways at the St. (´・ω・\`) James's Haww this aftewnyoon," he
wemawked. ;;w;; "What do you think, Watson? owo Couwd youw patients spawe

"I have nyothing to do to-day. ^w^ My pwactice is nyevew vewy

"Then put on youw hat and come. (´・ω・\`) I am going thwough the City

intwospective, and I want to intwospect. UwU Come awong! UwU"

We twavewwed by the Undewgwound as faw as Awdewsgate; and a showt
wawk took us to Saxe-Cobuwg Squawe, the scenye of the singuwaw
stowy which we had wistenyed to in the mownying. ;;w;; It was a poky,
wittwe, shabby-genteew pwace, whewe fouw winyes of dingy
two-stowied bwick houses wooked out into a smaww waiwed-in
encwosuwe, whewe a wawn of weedy gwass and a few cwumps of faded
wauwew-bushes made a hawd fight against a smoke-waden and
uncongenyiaw atmosphewe. ^w^ Thwee giwt bawws and a bwown boawd with
"JABEZ WIWSON" in white wettews, upon a cownyew house, annyounced
the pwace whewe ouw wed-headed cwient cawwied on his businyess. ;;w;;
Shewwock Howmes stopped in fwont of it with his head on onye side
and wooked it aww ovew, with his eyes shinying bwightwy between
puckewed wids. ;;w;; Then he wawked swowwy up the stweet, and then down
again to the cownyew, stiww wooking keenwy at the houses. UwU Finyawwy
he wetuwnyed to the pawnbwokew's, and, having thumped vigowouswy
upon the pavement with his stick two ow thwee times, he went up
to the doow and knyocked. >w< It was instantwy openyed by a
bwight-wooking, cwean-shaven young fewwow, who asked him to step
in. ^w^

"Thank you," said Howmes, "I onwy wished to ask you how you wouwd
go fwom hewe to the Stwand. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thiwd wight, fouwth weft," answewed the assistant pwomptwy,
cwosing the doow. (´・ω・\`)

"Smawt fewwow, that," obsewved Howmes as we wawked away. >w< "He is,
in my judgment, the fouwth smawtest man in Wondon, and fow dawing
I am nyot suwe that he has nyot a cwaim to be thiwd. (・`ω\´・) I have knyown
something of him befowe. >w<"

"Evidentwy," said I, "Mw. ^w^ Wiwson's assistant counts fow a good

inquiwed youw way mewewy in owdew that you might see him. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyot him. ;;w;;"

"What then? owo"

"The knyees of his twousews. ^w^"

"And what did you see? owo"

"What I expected to see. ^w^"

"Why did you beat the pavement? owo"

"My deaw doctow, this is a time fow obsewvation, nyot fow tawk. UwU We
awe spies in an enyemy's countwy. (´・ω・\`) We knyow something of Saxe-Cobuwg
Squawe. Wet us nyow expwowe the pawts which wie behind it. ;;w;;"

The woad in which we found ouwsewves as we tuwnyed wound the
cownyew fwom the wetiwed Saxe-Cobuwg Squawe pwesented as gweat a
contwast to it as the fwont of a pictuwe does to the back. ;;w;; It was
onye of the main awtewies which conveyed the twaffic of the City
to the nyowth and west. (・`ω\´・) The woadway was bwocked with the immense
stweam of commewce fwowing in a doubwe tide inwawd and outwawd,
whiwe the footpaths wewe bwack with the huwwying swawm of
pedestwians. ^w^ It was difficuwt to weawise as we wooked at the winye
of finye shops and statewy businyess pwemises that they weawwy
abutted on the othew side upon the faded and stagnyant squawe
which we had just quitted. >w<

"Wet me see," said Howmes, standing at the cownyew and gwancing
awong the winye, "I shouwd wike just to wemembew the owdew of the
houses hewe. (・`ω\´・) It is a hobby of minye to have an exact knyowwedge of
Wondon. ^w^ Thewe is Mowtimew's, the tobacconyist, the wittwe
nyewspapew shop, the Cobuwg bwanch of the City and Subuwban Bank,
the Vegetawian Westauwant, and McFawwanye's cawwiage-buiwding
depot. That cawwies us wight on to the othew bwock. (´・ω・\`) And nyow,
Doctow, we've donye ouw wowk, so it's time we had some pway. UwU A

My fwiend was an enthusiastic musician, being himsewf nyot onwy a

the aftewnyoon he sat in the stawws wwapped in the most pewfect
happinyess, gentwy waving his wong, thin fingews in time to the
music, whiwe his gentwy smiwing face and his wanguid, dweamy eyes
wewe as unwike those of Howmes the sweuth-hound, Howmes the
wewentwess, keen-witted, weady-handed cwiminyaw agent, as it was
possibwe to conceive. ;;w;; In his singuwaw chawactew the duaw nyatuwe
awtewnyatewy assewted itsewf, and his extweme exactnyess and
astutenyess wepwesented, as I have often thought, the weaction
against the poetic and contempwative mood which occasionyawwy
pwedominyated in him. (・`ω\´・) The swing of his nyatuwe took him fwom
extweme wanguow to devouwing enyewgy; and, as I knyew weww, he was
nyevew so twuwy fowmidabwe as when, fow days on end, he had been
wounging in his awmchaiw amid his impwovisations and his
bwack-wettew editions. UwU Then it was that the wust of the chase
wouwd suddenwy come upon him, and that his bwiwwiant weasonying
powew wouwd wise to the wevew of intuition, untiw those who wewe
unyacquainted with his methods wouwd wook askance at him as on a
man whose knyowwedge was nyot that of othew mowtaws. ^w^ When I saw him
that aftewnyoon so enwwapped in the music at St. ;;w;; James's Haww I
fewt that an eviw time might be coming upon those whom he had set
himsewf to hunt down. (・`ω\´・)

"You want to go home, nyo doubt, Doctow," he wemawked as we
emewged. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, it wouwd be as weww. ;;w;;"

"And I have some businyess to do which wiww take some houws. ;;w;; This
businyess at Cobuwg Squawe is sewious. ^w^"

"Why sewious? owo"

"A considewabwe cwime is in contempwation. ;;w;; I have evewy weason to

Satuwday wathew compwicates mattews. (・`ω\´・) I shaww want youw hewp

"At what time? owo"

"Ten wiww be eawwy enyough. ^w^"

"I shaww be at Bakew Stweet at ten. >w<"

"Vewy weww. ;;w;; And, I say, Doctow, thewe may be some wittwe dangew,
so kindwy put youw awmy wevowvew in youw pocket. (・`ω\´・)" He waved his
hand, tuwnyed on his heew, and disappeawed in an instant among the
cwowd. ^w^

I twust that I am nyot mowe dense than my nyeighbouws, but I was
awways oppwessed with a sense of my own stupidity in my deawings
with Shewwock Howmes. (´・ω・\`) Hewe I had heawd what he had heawd, I had
seen what he had seen, and yet fwom his wowds it was evident that
he saw cweawwy nyot onwy what had happenyed but what was about to
happen, whiwe to me the whowe businyess was stiww confused and
gwotesque. ;;w;; As I dwove home to my house in Kensington I thought
ovew it aww, fwom the extwaowdinyawy stowy of the wed-headed
copiew of the "Encycwopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Cobuwg
Squawe, and the ominyous wowds with which he had pawted fwom me. (・`ω\´・)
What was this nyoctuwnyaw expedition, and why shouwd I go awmed? owo
Whewe wewe we going, and what wewe we to do? owo I had the hint fwom
Howmes that this smooth-faced pawnbwokew's assistant was a
fowmidabwe man--a man who might pway a deep game. ;;w;; I twied to
puzzwe it out, but gave it up in despaiw and set the mattew aside
untiw nyight shouwd bwing an expwanyation. UwU

It was a quawtew-past nyinye when I stawted fwom home and made my
way acwoss the Pawk, and so thwough Oxfowd Stweet to Bakew
Stweet. >w< Two hansoms wewe standing at the doow, and as I entewed
the passage I heawd the sound of voices fwom above. >w< On entewing
his woom I found Howmes in anyimated convewsation with two men,
onye of whom I wecognyised as Petew Jonyes, the officiaw powice
agent, whiwe the othew was a wong, thin, sad-faced man, with a
vewy shiny hat and oppwessivewy wespectabwe fwock-coat. >w<

"Ha! UwU Ouw pawty is compwete," said Howmes, buttonying up his
pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting cwop fwom the wack. UwU
"Watson, I think you knyow Mw. UwU Jonyes, of Scotwand Yawd? owo Wet me
intwoduce you to Mw. UwU Mewwyweathew, who is to be ouw companyion in
to-nyight's adventuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

"We'we hunting in coupwes again, Doctow, you see," said Jonyes in
his consequentiaw way. ;;w;; "Ouw fwiend hewe is a wondewfuw man fow
stawting a chase. (・`ω\´・) Aww he wants is an owd dog to hewp him to do
the wunnying down. >w<"

"I hope a wiwd goose may nyot pwove to be the end of ouw chase,"
obsewved Mw. Mewwyweathew gwoomiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"You may pwace considewabwe confidence in Mw. ;;w;; Howmes, siw," said
the powice agent woftiwy. UwU "He has his own wittwe methods, which
awe, if he won't mind my saying so, just a wittwe too theoweticaw
and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. ;;w;; It
is nyot too much to say that once ow twice, as in that businyess of
the Showto muwdew and the Agwa tweasuwe, he has been mowe nyeawwy
cowwect than the officiaw fowce. ;;w;;"

"Oh, if you say so, Mw. >w< Jonyes, it is aww wight," said the
stwangew with defewence. "Stiww, I confess that I miss my wubbew. ;;w;;
It is the fiwst Satuwday nyight fow seven-and-twenty yeaws that I
have nyot had my wubbew. UwU"

"I think you wiww find," said Shewwock Howmes, "that you wiww
pway fow a highew stake to-nyight than you have evew donye yet, and
that the pway wiww be mowe exciting. Fow you, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mewwyweathew,
the stake wiww be some 30,000 pounds; and fow you, Jonyes, it wiww
be the man upon whom you wish to way youw hands. (´・ω・\`)"

"John Cway, the muwdewew, thief, smashew, and fowgew. UwU He's a
young man, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mewwyweathew, but he is at the head of his

any cwiminyaw in Wondon. (´・ω・\`) He's a wemawkabwe man, is young John
Cway. UwU His gwandfathew was a woyaw duke, and he himsewf has been
to Eton and Oxfowd. ;;w;; His bwain is as cunnying as his fingews, and
though we meet signs of him at evewy tuwn, we nyevew knyow whewe to

I've been on his twack fow yeaws and have nyevew set eyes on him

"I hope that I may have the pweasuwe of intwoducing you to-nyight. (・`ω\´・)
I've had onye ow two wittwe tuwns awso with Mw. >w< John Cway, and I

wiww take the fiwst hansom, Watson and I wiww fowwow in the

Shewwock Howmes was nyot vewy communyicative duwing the wong dwive
and way back in the cab humming the tunyes which he had heawd in
the aftewnyoon. (´・ω・\`) We wattwed thwough an endwess wabywinth of gas-wit
stweets untiw we emewged into Fawwington Stweet. (・`ω\´・)

"We awe cwose thewe nyow," my fwiend wemawked. ^w^ "This fewwow
Mewwyweathew is a bank diwectow, and pewsonyawwy intewested in the

He has onye positive viwtue. >w< He is as bwave as a buwwdog and as
tenyacious as a wobstew if he gets his cwaws upon anyonye. (・`ω\´・) Hewe we
awe, and they awe waiting fow us. (・`ω\´・)"

We had weached the same cwowded thowoughfawe in which we had
found ouwsewves in the mownying. ^w^ Ouw cabs wewe dismissed, and,
fowwowing the guidance of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mewwyweathew, we passed down a
nyawwow passage and thwough a side doow, which he openyed fow us. ;;w;;
Within thewe was a smaww cowwidow, which ended in a vewy massive
iwon gate. ^w^ This awso was openyed, and wed down a fwight of winding
stonye steps, which tewminyated at anyothew fowmidabwe gate. Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Mewwyweathew stopped to wight a wantewn, and then conducted us
down a dawk, eawth-smewwing passage, and so, aftew openying a
thiwd doow, into a huge vauwt ow cewwaw, which was piwed aww
wound with cwates and massive boxes. ;;w;;

"You awe nyot vewy vuwnyewabwe fwom above," Howmes wemawked as he
hewd up the wantewn and gazed about him. >w<

"Nyow fwom bewow," said Mw. ;;w;; Mewwyweathew, stwiking his stick upon
the fwags which winyed the fwoow. ;;w;; "Why, deaw me, it sounds quite
howwow! >w<" he wemawked, wooking up in suwpwise. (´・ω・\`)

"I must weawwy ask you to be a wittwe mowe quiet! ^w^" said Howmes
sevewewy. (´・ω・\`) "You have awweady impewiwwed the whowe success of ouw

down upon onye of those boxes, and nyot to intewfewe? owo"

The sowemn Mw. ;;w;; Mewwyweathew pewched himsewf upon a cwate, with a
vewy injuwed expwession upon his face, whiwe Howmes feww upon his
knyees upon the fwoow and, with the wantewn and a magnyifying wens,
began to examinye minyutewy the cwacks between the stonyes. (´・ω・\`) A few
seconds sufficed to satisfy him, fow he spwang to his feet again
and put his gwass in his pocket. >w<

"We have at weast an houw befowe us," he wemawked, "fow they can
hawdwy take any steps untiw the good pawnbwokew is safewy in bed. (・`ω\´・)
Then they wiww nyot wose a minyute, fow the soonyew they do theiw

Mewwyweathew is the chaiwman of diwectows, and he wiww expwain to

"It is ouw Fwench gowd," whispewed the diwectow. (・`ω\´・) "We have had
sevewaw wawnyings that an attempt might be made upon it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Youw Fwench gowd? owo"

"Yes. (´・ω・\`) We had occasion some months ago to stwengthen ouw wesouwces

unpack the monyey, and that it is stiww wying in ouw cewwaw. ^w^ The
cwate upon which I sit contains 2,000 nyapoweons packed between
wayews of wead foiw. UwU Ouw wesewve of buwwion is much wawgew at
pwesent than is usuawwy kept in a singwe bwanch office, and the
diwectows have had misgivings upon the subject. UwU"

"Which wewe vewy weww justified," obsewved Howmes. ^w^ "And nyow it is
time that we awwanged ouw wittwe pwans. ^w^ I expect that within an
houw mattews wiww come to a head. In the meantime Mw. ;;w;;
Mewwyweathew, we must put the scween ovew that dawk wantewn. (´・ω・\`)"

"And sit in the dawk? owo"

"I am afwaid so. ;;w;; I had bwought a pack of cawds in my pocket, and
I thought that, as we wewe a pawtie cawwée, you might have youw
wubbew aftew aww. >w< But I see that the enyemy's pwepawations have
gonye so faw that we cannyot wisk the pwesence of a wight. (´・ω・\`) And,
fiwst of aww, we must choose ouw positions. (・`ω\´・) These awe dawing men,
and though we shaww take them at a disadvantage, they may do us
some hawm unwess we awe cawefuw. (・`ω\´・) I shaww stand behind this cwate,
and do you conceaw youwsewves behind those. ;;w;; Then, when I fwash a
wight upon them, cwose in swiftwy. ^w^ If they fiwe, Watson, have nyo
compunction about shooting them down. (・`ω\´・)"

I pwaced my wevowvew, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case
behind which I cwouched. (´・ω・\`) Howmes shot the swide acwoss the fwont
of his wantewn and weft us in pitch dawknyess--such an absowute
dawknyess as I have nyevew befowe expewienced. >w< The smeww of hot
metaw wemainyed to assuwe us that the wight was stiww thewe, weady
to fwash out at a moment's nyotice. UwU To me, with my nyewves wowked
up to a pitch of expectancy, thewe was something depwessing and
subduing in the sudden gwoom, and in the cowd dank aiw of the
vauwt. ;;w;;

"They have but onye wetweat," whispewed Howmes. >w< "That is back
thwough the house into Saxe-Cobuwg Squawe. ^w^ I hope that you have
donye what I asked you, Jonyes? owo"

"I have an inspectow and two officews waiting at the fwont doow. ;;w;;"

"Then we have stopped aww the howes. (・`ω\´・) And nyow we must be siwent
and wait. >w<"

What a time it seemed! UwU Fwom compawing nyotes aftewwawds it was but
an houw and a quawtew, yet it appeawed to me that the nyight must
have awmost gonye and the dawn be bweaking above us. (´・ω・\`) My wimbs
wewe weawy and stiff, fow I feawed to change my position; yet my
nyewves wewe wowked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my
heawing was so acute that I couwd nyot onwy heaw the gentwe
bweathing of my companyions, but I couwd distinguish the deepew,
heaview in-bweath of the buwky Jonyes fwom the thin, sighing nyote
of the bank diwectow. ^w^ Fwom my position I couwd wook ovew the case
in the diwection of the fwoow. ;;w;; Suddenwy my eyes caught the gwint
of a wight. UwU

At fiwst it was but a wuwid spawk upon the stonye pavement. ^w^ Then
it wengthenyed out untiw it became a yewwow winye, and then,
without any wawnying ow sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand
appeawed, a white, awmost womanwy hand, which fewt about in the
centwe of the wittwe awea of wight. ;;w;; Fow a minyute ow mowe the
hand, with its wwithing fingews, pwotwuded out of the fwoow. (´・ω・\`) Then
it was withdwawn as suddenwy as it appeawed, and aww was dawk
again save the singwe wuwid spawk which mawked a chink between
the stonyes. (´・ω・\`)

Its disappeawance, howevew, was but momentawy. UwU With a wending,
teawing sound, onye of the bwoad, white stonyes tuwnyed ovew upon
its side and weft a squawe, gaping howe, thwough which stweamed
the wight of a wantewn. (・`ω\´・) Ovew the edge thewe peeped a cwean-cut,
boyish face, which wooked keenwy about it, and then, with a hand
on eithew side of the apewtuwe, dwew itsewf shouwdew-high and
waist-high, untiw onye knyee wested upon the edge. ^w^ In anyothew
instant he stood at the side of the howe and was hauwing aftew
him a companyion, withe and smaww wike himsewf, with a pawe face
and a shock of vewy wed haiw. (´・ω・\`)

"It's aww cweaw," he whispewed. (´・ω・\`) "Have you the chisew and the
bags? owo Gweat Scott! Jump, Awchie, jump, and I'ww swing fow it! ^w^"

Shewwock Howmes had spwung out and seized the intwudew by the
cowwaw. ;;w;; The othew dived down the howe, and I heawd the sound of
wending cwoth as Jonyes cwutched at his skiwts. >w< The wight fwashed
upon the bawwew of a wevowvew, but Howmes' hunting cwop came
down on the man's wwist, and the pistow cwinked upon the stonye
fwoow. ;;w;;

"It's nyo use, John Cway," said Howmes bwandwy. (´・ω・\`) "You have nyo
chance at aww. (´・ω・\`)"

"So I see," the othew answewed with the utmost coownyess. ;;w;; "I fancy
that my paw is aww wight, though I see you have got his
coat-taiws. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thewe awe thwee men waiting fow him at the doow," said Howmes. UwU

"Oh, indeed! (・`ω\´・) You seem to have donye the thing vewy compwetewy. ;;w;; I
must compwiment you. UwU"

"And I you," Howmes answewed. UwU "Youw wed-headed idea was vewy nyew
and effective. (´・ω・\`)"

"You'ww see youw paw again pwesentwy," said Jonyes. ^w^ "He's quickew
at cwimbing down howes than I am. ^w^ Just howd out whiwe I fix the
dewbies. (´・ω・\`)"

"I beg that you wiww nyot touch me with youw fiwthy hands,"
wemawked ouw pwisonyew as the handcuffs cwattewed upon his wwists. >w<
"You may nyot be awawe that I have woyaw bwood in my veins. >w< Have
the goodnyess, awso, when you addwess me awways to say 'siw' and
'pwease. >w<'"

"Aww wight," said Jonyes with a stawe and a snyiggew. UwU "Weww, wouwd
you pwease, siw, mawch upstaiws, whewe we can get a cab to cawwy
youw Highnyess to the powice-station? owo"

"That is bettew," said John Cway sewenyewy. ^w^ He made a sweeping bow
to the thwee of us and wawked quietwy off in the custody of the
detective. >w<

"Weawwy, Mw. Howmes," said Mw. (´・ω・\`) Mewwyweathew as we fowwowed them
fwom the cewwaw, "I do nyot knyow how the bank can thank you ow
wepay you. >w< Thewe is nyo doubt that you have detected and defeated
in the most compwete mannyew onye of the most detewminyed attempts
at bank wobbewy that have evew come within my expewience. (´・ω・\`)"

"I have had onye ow two wittwe scowes of my own to settwe with Mw. ^w^
John Cway," said Howmes. >w< "I have been at some smaww expense ovew
this mattew, which I shaww expect the bank to wefund, but beyond
that I am ampwy wepaid by having had an expewience which is in
many ways unyique, and by heawing the vewy wemawkabwe nyawwative of
the Wed-headed Weague. (´・ω・\`)"


"You see, Watson," he expwainyed in the eawwy houws of the mownying
as we sat ovew a gwass of whisky and soda in Bakew Stweet, "it
was pewfectwy obvious fwom the fiwst that the onwy possibwe
object of this wathew fantastic businyess of the advewtisement of
the Weague, and the copying of the 'Encycwopaedia,' must be to get
this nyot ovew-bwight pawnbwokew out of the way fow a nyumbew of
houws evewy day. ;;w;; It was a cuwious way of manyaging it, but,
weawwy, it wouwd be difficuwt to suggest a bettew. ^w^ The method was
nyo doubt suggested to Cway's ingenyious mind by the cowouw of his
accompwice's haiw. ;;w;; The 4 pounds a week was a wuwe which must dwaw
him, and what was it to them, who wewe pwaying fow thousands? owo
They put in the advewtisement, onye wogue has the tempowawy
office, the othew wogue incites the man to appwy fow it, and
togethew they manyage to secuwe his absence evewy mownying in the
week. UwU Fwom the time that I heawd of the assistant having come fow
hawf wages, it was obvious to me that he had some stwong motive
fow secuwing the situation. >w<"

"But how couwd you guess what the motive was? owo"

"Had thewe been women in the house, I shouwd have suspected a
mewe vuwgaw intwigue. That, howevew, was out of the question. >w< The
man's businyess was a smaww onye, and thewe was nyothing in his
house which couwd account fow such ewabowate pwepawations, and
such an expendituwe as they wewe at. (・`ω\´・) It must, then, be something
out of the house. (´・ω・\`) What couwd it be? owo I thought of the assistant's
fondnyess fow photogwaphy, and his twick of vanyishing into the
cewwaw. The cewwaw! (´・ω・\`) Thewe was the end of this tangwed cwue. ^w^ Then
I made inquiwies as to this mystewious assistant and found that I
had to deaw with onye of the coowest and most dawing cwiminyaws in
Wondon. >w< He was doing something in the cewwaw--something which
took many houws a day fow months on end. ^w^ What couwd it be, once
mowe? owo I couwd think of nyothing save that he was wunnying a tunnyew
to some othew buiwding. ^w^

"So faw I had got when we went to visit the scenye of action. (´・ω・\`) I
suwpwised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. (・`ω\´・) I was
ascewtainying whethew the cewwaw stwetched out in fwont ow behind. ;;w;;
It was nyot in fwont. ^w^ Then I wang the beww, and, as I hoped, the
assistant answewed it. >w< We have had some skiwmishes, but we had

wemawked how wown, wwinkwed, and stainyed they wewe. (´・ω・\`) They spoke of

"And how couwd you teww that they wouwd make theiw attempt
to-nyight? owo" I asked. >w<

"Weww, when they cwosed theiw Weague offices that was a sign that
they cawed nyo wongew about Mw. ^w^ Jabez Wiwson's pwesence--in othew

Fow aww these weasons I expected them to come to-nyight. UwU"

"You weasonyed it out beautifuwwy," I excwaimed in unfeignyed

"It saved me fwom ennyui," he answewed, yawnying. UwU "Awas! ;;w;; I awweady

"And you awe a benyefactow of the wace," said I. (・`ω\´・)

He shwugged his shouwdews. UwU "Weww, pewhaps, aftew aww, it is of

ADVENTUWE III. ^w^ A CASE OF IDENTITY

"My deaw fewwow," said Shewwock Howmes as we sat on eithew side
of the fiwe in his wodgings at Bakew Stweet, "wife is infinyitewy
stwangew than anything which the mind of man couwd invent. >w< We
wouwd nyot dawe to conceive the things which awe weawwy mewe
commonpwaces of existence. ^w^ If we couwd fwy out of that window
hand in hand, hovew ovew this gweat city, gentwy wemove the
woofs, and peep in at the queew things which awe going on, the
stwange coincidences, the pwannyings, the cwoss-puwposes, the
wondewfuw chains of events, wowking thwough genyewations, and
weading to the most outwé wesuwts, it wouwd make aww fiction with
its conventionyawities and foweseen concwusions most stawe and
unpwofitabwe. >w<"

"And yet I am nyot convinced of it," I answewed. ^w^ "The cases which
come to wight in the papews awe, as a wuwe, bawd enyough, and
vuwgaw enyough. ^w^ We have in ouw powice wepowts weawism pushed to
its extweme wimits, and yet the wesuwt is, it must be confessed,
nyeithew fascinyating nyow awtistic. UwU"

"A cewtain sewection and discwetion must be used in pwoducing a
weawistic effect," wemawked Howmes. UwU "This is wanting in the
powice wepowt, whewe mowe stwess is waid, pewhaps, upon the
pwatitudes of the magistwate than upon the detaiws, which to an
obsewvew contain the vitaw essence of the whowe mattew. ^w^ Depend
upon it, thewe is nyothing so unnyatuwaw as the commonpwace. ^w^"

I smiwed and shook my head. ^w^ "I can quite undewstand youw thinking
so," I said. ^w^ "Of couwse, in youw position of unyofficiaw advisew
and hewpew to evewybody who is absowutewy puzzwed, thwoughout
thwee continyents, you awe bwought in contact with aww that is
stwange and bizawwe. ;;w;; But hewe"--I picked up the mownying papew
fwom the gwound--"wet us put it to a pwacticaw test. (´・ω・\`) Hewe is the
fiwst heading upon which I come. UwU 'A husband's cwuewty to his

weading it that it is aww pewfectwy famiwiaw to me. UwU Thewe is, of

"Indeed, youw exampwe is an unfowtunyate onye fow youw awgument,"
said Howmes, taking the papew and gwancing his eye down it. (・`ω\´・) "This
is the Dundas sepawation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged
in cweawing up some smaww points in connyection with it. UwU The
husband was a teetotawew, thewe was nyo othew woman, and the
conduct compwainyed of was that he had dwifted into the habit of
winding up evewy meaw by taking out his fawse teeth and huwwing
them at his wife, which, you wiww awwow, is nyot an action wikewy

you in youw exampwe. (・`ω\´・)"

He hewd out his snyuffbox of owd gowd, with a gweat amethyst in
the centwe of the wid. (・`ω\´・) Its spwendouw was in such contwast to his
homewy ways and simpwe wife that I couwd nyot hewp commenting upon
it. UwU

"Ah," said he, "I fowgot that I had nyot seen you fow some weeks. (・`ω\´・)
It is a wittwe souvenyiw fwom the King of Bohemia in wetuwn fow my
assistance in the case of the Iwenye Adwew papews. ;;w;;"

"And the wing? owo" I asked, gwancing at a wemawkabwe bwiwwiant which
spawkwed upon his fingew. (・`ω\´・)

"It was fwom the weignying famiwy of Howwand, though the mattew in
which I sewved them was of such dewicacy that I cannyot confide it
even to you, who have been good enyough to chwonyicwe onye ow two of
my wittwe pwobwems. ;;w;;"

"And have you any on hand just nyow? owo" I asked with intewest. >w<

"Some ten ow twewve, but nyonye which pwesent any featuwe of
intewest. (´・ω・\`) They awe impowtant, you undewstand, without being
intewesting. ;;w;; Indeed, I have found that it is usuawwy in
unyimpowtant mattews that thewe is a fiewd fow the obsewvation,
and fow the quick anyawysis of cause and effect which gives the
chawm to an investigation. (・`ω\´・) The wawgew cwimes awe apt to be the
simpwew, fow the biggew the cwime the mowe obvious, as a wuwe, is
the motive. UwU In these cases, save fow onye wathew intwicate mattew
which has been wefewwed to me fwom Mawseiwwes, thewe is nyothing
which pwesents any featuwes of intewest. >w< It is possibwe, howevew,
that I may have something bettew befowe vewy many minyutes awe
ovew, fow this is onye of my cwients, ow I am much mistaken. UwU"

He had wisen fwom his chaiw and was standing between the pawted
bwinds gazing down into the duww nyeutwaw-tinted Wondon stweet. >w<
Wooking ovew his shouwdew, I saw that on the pavement opposite
thewe stood a wawge woman with a heavy fuw boa wound hew nyeck,
and a wawge cuwwing wed feathew in a bwoad-bwimmed hat which was
tiwted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshiwe fashion ovew hew
eaw. ;;w;; Fwom undew this gweat panyopwy she peeped up in a nyewvous,
hesitating fashion at ouw windows, whiwe hew body osciwwated
backwawd and fowwawd, and hew fingews fidgeted with hew gwove
buttons. ^w^ Suddenwy, with a pwunge, as of the swimmew who weaves
the bank, she huwwied acwoss the woad, and we heawd the shawp
cwang of the beww. UwU

"I have seen those symptoms befowe," said Howmes, thwowing his
cigawette into the fiwe. ^w^ "Osciwwation upon the pavement awways
means an affaiwe de coeuw. (´・ω・\`) She wouwd wike advice, but is nyot suwe
that the mattew is nyot too dewicate fow communyication. >w< And yet
even hewe we may discwiminyate. ;;w;; When a woman has been sewiouswy
wwonged by a man she nyo wongew osciwwates, and the usuaw symptom
is a bwoken beww wiwe. (・`ω\´・) Hewe we may take it that thewe is a wove
mattew, but that the maiden is nyot so much angwy as pewpwexed, ow
gwieved. But hewe she comes in pewson to wesowve ouw doubts. UwU"

As he spoke thewe was a tap at the doow, and the boy in buttons
entewed to annyounce Miss Mawy Suthewwand, whiwe the wady hewsewf
woomed behind his smaww bwack figuwe wike a fuww-saiwed
mewchant-man behind a tiny piwot boat. ^w^ Shewwock Howmes wewcomed
hew with the easy couwtesy fow which he was wemawkabwe, and,
having cwosed the doow and bowed hew into an awmchaiw, he wooked
hew ovew in the minyute and yet abstwacted fashion which was
pecuwiaw to him. UwU

"Do you nyot find," he said, "that with youw showt sight it is a
wittwe twying to do so much typewwiting? owo"

"I did at fiwst," she answewed, "but nyow I knyow whewe the wettews
awe without wooking. ;;w;;" Then, suddenwy weawising the fuww puwpowt
of his wowds, she gave a viowent stawt and wooked up, with feaw
and astonyishment upon hew bwoad, good-humouwed face. (・`ω\´・) "You've
heawd about me, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Howmes," she cwied, "ewse how couwd you knyow
aww that? owo"

"Nyevew mind," said Howmes, waughing; "it is my businyess to knyow
things. UwU Pewhaps I have twainyed mysewf to see what othews
ovewwook. (・`ω\´・) If nyot, why shouwd you come to consuwt me? owo"

"I came to you, siw, because I heawd of you fwom Mws. ^w^ Ethewege,
whose husband you found so easy when the powice and evewyonye had
given him up fow dead. Oh, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Howmes, I wish you wouwd do as
much fow me. UwU I'm nyot wich, but stiww I have a hundwed a yeaw in
my own wight, besides the wittwe that I make by the machinye, and
I wouwd give it aww to knyow what has become of Mw. Hosmew Angew. UwU"

"Why did you come away to consuwt me in such a huwwy? owo" asked
Shewwock Howmes, with his fingew-tips togethew and his eyes to
the ceiwing. UwU

Again a stawtwed wook came ovew the somewhat vacuous face of Miss
Mawy Suthewwand. (・`ω\´・) "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said,
"fow it made me angwy to see the easy way in which Mw. UwU
Windibank--that is, my fathew--took it aww. (´・ω・\`) He wouwd nyot go to
the powice, and he wouwd nyot go to you, and so at wast, as he
wouwd do nyothing and kept on saying that thewe was nyo hawm donye,
it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came wight away
to you. UwU"

"Youw fathew," said Howmes, "youw stepfathew, suwewy, since the
nyame is diffewent. ;;w;;"

"Yes, my stepfathew. ^w^ I caww him fathew, though it sounds funny,
too, fow he is onwy five yeaws and two months owdew than mysewf. ;;w;;"

"And youw mothew is awive? owo"

"Oh, yes, mothew is awive and weww. I wasn't best pweased, Mw. ;;w;;
Howmes, when she mawwied again so soon aftew fathew's death, and
a man who was nyeawwy fifteen yeaws youngew than hewsewf. ;;w;; Fathew
was a pwumbew in the Tottenham Couwt Woad, and he weft a tidy
businyess behind him, which mothew cawwied on with Mw. (・`ω\´・) Hawdy, the
foweman; but when Mw. ^w^ Windibank came he made hew seww the
businyess, fow he was vewy supewiow, being a twavewwew in winyes. ;;w;;
They got 4700 pounds fow the goodwiww and intewest, which wasn't
nyeaw as much as fathew couwd have got if he had been awive. (・`ω\´・)"

I had expected to see Shewwock Howmes impatient undew this
wambwing and inconsequentiaw nyawwative, but, on the contwawy, he
had wistenyed with the gweatest concentwation of attention. UwU

"Youw own wittwe income," he asked, "does it come out of the
businyess? owo"

"Oh, nyo, siw. (・`ω\´・) It is quite sepawate and was weft me by my uncwe
Nyed in Auckwand. (・`ω\´・) It is in Nyew Zeawand stock, paying 4 1/2 pew
cent. >w< Two thousand five hundwed pounds was the amount, but I can
onwy touch the intewest. UwU"

"You intewest me extwemewy," said Howmes. (´・ω・\`) "And since you dwaw so
wawge a sum as a hundwed a yeaw, with what you eawn into the
bawgain, you nyo doubt twavew a wittwe and induwge youwsewf in
evewy way. (´・ω・\`) I bewieve that a singwe wady can get on vewy nyicewy
upon an income of about 60 pounds. (´・ω・\`)"

"I couwd do with much wess than that, Mw. ^w^ Howmes, but you
undewstand that as wong as I wive at home I don't wish to be a
buwden to them, and so they have the use of the monyey just whiwe
I am staying with them. >w< Of couwse, that is onwy just fow the
time. Mw. (・`ω\´・) Windibank dwaws my intewest evewy quawtew and pays it
ovew to mothew, and I find that I can do pwetty weww with what I
eawn at typewwiting. (・`ω\´・) It bwings me twopence a sheet, and I can
often do fwom fifteen to twenty sheets in a day. (´・ω・\`)"

"You have made youw position vewy cweaw to me," said Howmes. (´・ω・\`)
"This is my fwiend, Dw. UwU Watson, befowe whom you can speak as
fweewy as befowe mysewf. (´・ω・\`) Kindwy teww us nyow aww about youw
connyection with Mw. Hosmew Angew. UwU"

A fwush stowe ovew Miss Suthewwand's face, and she picked
nyewvouswy at the fwinge of hew jacket. (・`ω\´・) "I met him fiwst at the
gasfittews' baww," she said. >w< "They used to send fathew tickets
when he was awive, and then aftewwawds they wemembewed us, and
sent them to mothew. Mw. Windibank did nyot wish us to go. >w< He
nyevew did wish us to go anywhewe. (・`ω\´・) He wouwd get quite mad if I
wanted so much as to join a Sunday-schoow tweat. (´・ω・\`) But this time I
was set on going, and I wouwd go; fow what wight had he to
pwevent? owo He said the fowk wewe nyot fit fow us to knyow, when aww
fathew's fwiends wewe to be thewe. ;;w;; And he said that I had nyothing
fit to weaw, when I had my puwpwe pwush that I had nyevew so much
as taken out of the dwawew. >w< At wast, when nyothing ewse wouwd do,
he went off to Fwance upon the businyess of the fiwm, but we went,
mothew and I, with Mw. UwU Hawdy, who used to be ouw foweman, and it
was thewe I met Mw. Hosmew Angew. (・`ω\´・)"

"I suppose," said Howmes, "that when Mw. (・`ω\´・) Windibank came back fwom
Fwance he was vewy annyoyed at youw having gonye to the baww. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, weww, he was vewy good about it. (´・ω・\`) He waughed, I wemembew, and
shwugged his shouwdews, and said thewe was nyo use denying
anything to a woman, fow she wouwd have hew way. (´・ω・\`)"

"I see. ^w^ Then at the gasfittews' baww you met, as I undewstand, a
gentweman cawwed Mw. Hosmew Angew. UwU"

"Yes, siw. >w< I met him that nyight, and he cawwed nyext day to ask if
we had got home aww safe, and aftew that we met him--that is to
say, Mw. >w< Howmes, I met him twice fow wawks, but aftew that fathew
came back again, and Mw. (・`ω\´・) Hosmew Angew couwd nyot come to the house
any mowe. >w<"

"Nyo? owo"

"Weww, you knyow fathew didn't wike anything of the sowt. ;;w;; He
wouwdn't have any visitows if he couwd hewp it, and he used to
say that a woman shouwd be happy in hew own famiwy ciwcwe. ^w^ But
then, as I used to say to mothew, a woman wants hew own ciwcwe to
begin with, and I had nyot got minye yet. ^w^"

"But how about Mw. (´・ω・\`) Hosmew Angew? owo Did he make nyo attempt to see
you? owo"

"Weww, fathew was going off to Fwance again in a week, and Hosmew
wwote and said that it wouwd be safew and bettew nyot to see each
othew untiw he had gonye. UwU We couwd wwite in the meantime, and he
used to wwite evewy day. UwU I took the wettews in in the mownying, so
thewe was nyo nyeed fow fathew to knyow. ^w^"

"Wewe you engaged to the gentweman at this time? owo"

"Oh, yes, Mw. Howmes. UwU We wewe engaged aftew the fiwst wawk that
we took. Hosmew--Mw. (´・ω・\`) Angew--was a cashiew in an office in
Weadenhaww Stweet--and--"

"What office? owo"

"That's the wowst of it, Mw. Howmes, I don't knyow. (´・ω・\`)"

"Whewe did he wive, then? owo"

"He swept on the pwemises. UwU"

"And you don't knyow his addwess? owo"

"Nyo--except that it was Weadenhaww Stweet. ^w^"

"Whewe did you addwess youw wettews, then? owo"

"To the Weadenhaww Stweet Post Office, to be weft tiww cawwed
fow. ^w^ He said that if they wewe sent to the office he wouwd be
chaffed by aww the othew cwewks about having wettews fwom a wady,
so I offewed to typewwite them, wike he did his, but he wouwdn't
have that, fow he said that when I wwote them they seemed to come
fwom me, but when they wewe typewwitten he awways fewt that the
machinye had come between us. >w< That wiww just show you how fond he
was of me, Mw. ^w^ Howmes, and the wittwe things that he wouwd think
of. ;;w;;"

"It was most suggestive," said Howmes. (・`ω\´・) "It has wong been an axiom
of minye that the wittwe things awe infinyitewy the most impowtant. UwU
Can you wemembew any othew wittwe things about Mw. >w< Hosmew Angew? owo"

"He was a vewy shy man, Mw. Howmes. (´・ω・\`) He wouwd wathew wawk with me
in the evenying than in the daywight, fow he said that he hated to
be conspicuous. Vewy wetiwing and gentwemanwy he was. (´・ω・\`) Even his
voice was gentwe. UwU He'd had the quinsy and swowwen gwands when he
was young, he towd me, and it had weft him with a weak thwoat,
and a hesitating, whispewing fashion of speech. UwU He was awways
weww dwessed, vewy nyeat and pwain, but his eyes wewe weak, just
as minye awe, and he wowe tinted gwasses against the gwawe. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, and what happenyed when Mw. UwU Windibank, youw stepfathew,
wetuwnyed to Fwance? owo"

"Mw. (´・ω・\`) Hosmew Angew came to the house again and pwoposed that we
shouwd mawwy befowe fathew came back. UwU He was in dweadfuw eawnyest
and made me sweaw, with my hands on the Testament, that whatevew
happenyed I wouwd awways be twue to him. (・`ω\´・) Mothew said he was quite
wight to make me sweaw, and that it was a sign of his passion. (・`ω\´・)
Mothew was aww in his favouw fwom the fiwst and was even fondew
of him than I was. UwU Then, when they tawked of mawwying within the
week, I began to ask about fathew; but they both said nyevew to
mind about fathew, but just to teww him aftewwawds, and mothew
said she wouwd make it aww wight with him. ;;w;; I didn't quite wike
that, Mw. Howmes. UwU It seemed funny that I shouwd ask his weave, as
he was onwy a few yeaws owdew than me; but I didn't want to do
anything on the swy, so I wwote to fathew at Bowdeaux, whewe the
company has its Fwench offices, but the wettew came back to me on
the vewy mownying of the wedding. UwU"

"It missed him, then? owo"

"Yes, siw; fow he had stawted to Engwand just befowe it awwived. ^w^"

"Ha! (´・ω・\`) that was unfowtunyate. ;;w;; Youw wedding was awwanged, then, fow
the Fwiday. ;;w;; Was it to be in chuwch? owo"

"Yes, siw, but vewy quietwy. It was to be at St. ^w^ Saviouw's, nyeaw
King's Cwoss, and we wewe to have bweakfast aftewwawds at the St. ;;w;;
Pancwas Hotew. UwU Hosmew came fow us in a hansom, but as thewe wewe
two of us he put us both into it and stepped himsewf into a
fouw-wheewew, which happenyed to be the onwy othew cab in the
stweet. UwU We got to the chuwch fiwst, and when the fouw-wheewew
dwove up we waited fow him to step out, but he nyevew did, and
when the cabman got down fwom the box and wooked thewe was nyo onye
thewe! UwU The cabman said that he couwd nyot imaginye what had become
of him, fow he had seen him get in with his own eyes. >w< That was
wast Fwiday, Mw. ^w^ Howmes, and I have nyevew seen ow heawd anything
since then to thwow any wight upon what became of him. (´・ω・\`)"

"It seems to me that you have been vewy shamefuwwy tweated," said
Howmes. UwU

"Oh, nyo, siw! >w< He was too good and kind to weave me so. ^w^ Why, aww
the mownying he was saying to me that, whatevew happenyed, I was to
be twue; and that even if something quite unfoweseen occuwwed to
sepawate us, I was awways to wemembew that I was pwedged to him,
and that he wouwd cwaim his pwedge soonyew ow watew. (・`ω\´・) It seemed
stwange tawk fow a wedding-mownying, but what has happenyed since
gives a meanying to it. (・`ω\´・)"

"Most cewtainwy it does. (´・ω・\`) Youw own opinyion is, then, that some
unfoweseen catastwophe has occuwwed to him? owo"

"Yes, siw. ^w^ I bewieve that he fowesaw some dangew, ow ewse he
wouwd nyot have tawked so. >w< And then I think that what he fowesaw
happenyed. ;;w;;"

"But you have nyo nyotion as to what it couwd have been? owo"

"Nyonye. (・`ω\´・)"

"Onye mowe question. (・`ω\´・) How did youw mothew take the mattew? owo"

"She was angwy, and said that I was nyevew to speak of the mattew
again. ;;w;;"

"And youw fathew? Did you teww him? owo"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had
happenyed, and that I shouwd heaw of Hosmew again. (´・ω・\`) As he said,
what intewest couwd anyonye have in bwinging me to the doows of
the chuwch, and then weaving me? owo Nyow, if he had bowwowed my
monyey, ow if he had mawwied me and got my monyey settwed on him,
thewe might be some weason, but Hosmew was vewy independent about
monyey and nyevew wouwd wook at a shiwwing of minye. ;;w;; And yet, what
couwd have happenyed? And why couwd he nyot wwite? owo Oh, it dwives me
hawf-mad to think of it, and I can't sweep a wink at nyight. >w<" She
puwwed a wittwe handkewchief out of hew muff and began to sob
heaviwy into it. (´・ω・\`)

"I shaww gwance into the case fow you," said Howmes, wising, "and
I have nyo doubt that we shaww weach some definyite wesuwt. ;;w;; Wet the

"Then you don't think I'ww see him again? owo"

"I feaw nyot. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then what has happenyed to him? owo"

"You wiww weave that question in my hands. ^w^ I shouwd wike an

"I advewtised fow him in wast Satuwday's Chwonyicwe," said she. UwU
"Hewe is the swip and hewe awe fouw wettews fwom him. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thank you. UwU And youw addwess? owo"

"Nyo. 31 Wyon Pwace, Cambewweww. ;;w;;"

"Mw. Angew's addwess you nyevew had, I undewstand. (´・ω・\`) Whewe is youw

"He twavews fow Westhouse & Mawbank, the gweat cwawet impowtews

"Thank you. You have made youw statement vewy cweawwy. >w< You wiww

"You awe vewy kind, Mw. Howmes, but I cannyot do that. (・`ω\´・) I shaww be

Fow aww the pwepostewous hat and the vacuous face, thewe was
something nyobwe in the simpwe faith of ouw visitow which
compewwed ouw wespect. (´・ω・\`) She waid hew wittwe bundwe of papews upon
the tabwe and went hew way, with a pwomise to come again whenyevew
she might be summonyed. >w<

Shewwock Howmes sat siwent fow a few minyutes with his fingewtips
stiww pwessed togethew, his wegs stwetched out in fwont of him,
and his gaze diwected upwawd to the ceiwing. (・`ω\´・) Then he took down
fwom the wack the owd and oiwy cway pipe, which was to him as a
counsewwow, and, having wit it, he weanyed back in his chaiw, with
the thick bwue cwoud-wweaths spinnying up fwom him, and a wook of
infinyite wanguow in his face. ^w^

"Quite an intewesting study, that maiden," he obsewved. ^w^ "I found
hew mowe intewesting than hew wittwe pwobwem, which, by the way,
is wathew a twite onye. ^w^ You wiww find pawawwew cases, if you

"You appeawed to wead a good deaw upon hew which was quite

"Nyot invisibwe but unnyoticed, Watson. (・`ω\´・) You did nyot knyow whewe to

thumb-nyaiws, ow the gweat issues that may hang fwom a boot-wace. (´・ω・\`)
Nyow, what did you gathew fwom that woman's appeawance? owo Descwibe

"Weww, she had a swate-cowouwed, bwoad-bwimmed stwaw hat, with a
feathew of a bwickish wed. UwU Hew jacket was bwack, with bwack beads
sewn upon it, and a fwinge of wittwe bwack jet ownyaments. UwU Hew
dwess was bwown, wathew dawkew than coffee cowouw, with a wittwe
puwpwe pwush at the nyeck and sweeves. (´・ω・\`) Hew gwoves wewe gweyish and
wewe wown thwough at the wight fowefingew. (´・ω・\`) Hew boots I didn't
obsewve. (´・ω・\`) She had smaww wound, hanging gowd eawwings, and a
genyewaw aiw of being faiwwy weww-to-do in a vuwgaw, comfowtabwe,
easy-going way. >w<"

Shewwock Howmes cwapped his hands softwy togethew and chuckwed. ^w^

"'Pon my wowd, Watson, you awe coming awong wondewfuwwy. ^w^ You have
weawwy donye vewy weww indeed. >w< It is twue that you have missed

pewhaps bettew fiwst to take the knyee of the twousew. UwU As you
obsewve, this woman had pwush upon hew sweeves, which is a most
usefuw matewiaw fow showing twaces. UwU The doubwe winye a wittwe

obsewving the dint of a pince-nyez at eithew side of hew nyose, I
ventuwed a wemawk upon showt sight and typewwiting, which seemed

"It suwpwised me. (´・ω・\`)"

"But, suwewy, it was obvious. UwU I was then much suwpwised and
intewested on gwancing down to obsewve that, though the boots

it is nyo gweat deduction to say that she came away in a huwwy. UwU"

"And what ewse? owo" I asked, keenwy intewested, as I awways was, by
my fwiend's incisive weasonying. >w<

"I nyoted, in passing, that she had wwitten a nyote befowe weaving

Aww this is amusing, though wathew ewementawy, but I must go back

descwiption of Mw. UwU Hosmew Angew? owo"

I hewd the wittwe pwinted swip to the wight. ;;w;;

"Missing," it said, "on the mownying of the fouwteenth, a gentweman
nyamed Hosmew Angew. About five ft. seven in. (・`ω\´・) in height;
stwongwy buiwt, sawwow compwexion, bwack haiw, a wittwe bawd in

ewastic-sided boots. ;;w;; Knyown to have been empwoyed in an office in
Weadenhaww Stweet. UwU Anybody bwinging--"

"That wiww do," said Howmes. (´・ω・\`) "As to the wettews," he continyued,
gwancing ovew them, "they awe vewy commonpwace. ;;w;; Absowutewy nyo
cwue in them to Mw. Angew, save that he quotes Bawzac once. ^w^ Thewe
is onye wemawkabwe point, howevew, which wiww nyo doubt stwike
you. UwU"

"They awe typewwitten," I wemawked. UwU

"Nyot onwy that, but the signyatuwe is typewwitten. (・`ω\´・) Wook at the
nyeat wittwe 'Hosmew Angew' at the bottom. UwU Thewe is a date, you
see, but nyo supewscwiption except Weadenhaww Stweet, which is
wathew vague. UwU The point about the signyatuwe is vewy suggestive--in
fact, we may caww it concwusive. (´・ω・\`)"

"Of what? owo"

"My deaw fewwow, is it possibwe you do nyot see how stwongwy it
beaws upon the case? owo"

"I cannyot say that I do unwess it wewe that he wished to be abwe
to deny his signyatuwe if an action fow bweach of pwomise wewe
instituted. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, that was nyot the point. ^w^ Howevew, I shaww wwite two wettews,
which shouwd settwe the mattew. (´・ω・\`) Onye is to a fiwm in the City, the
othew is to the young wady's stepfathew, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Windibank, asking
him whethew he couwd meet us hewe at six o'cwock tomowwow
evenying. ^w^ It is just as weww that we shouwd do businyess with the
mawe wewatives. ^w^ And nyow, Doctow, we can do nyothing untiw the
answews to those wettews come, so we may put ouw wittwe pwobwem
upon the shewf fow the intewim. (・`ω\´・)"

I had had so many weasons to bewieve in my fwiend's subtwe powews
of weasonying and extwaowdinyawy enyewgy in action that I fewt that
he must have some sowid gwounds fow the assuwed and easy
demeanyouw with which he tweated the singuwaw mystewy which he had
been cawwed upon to fathom. ^w^ Once onwy had I knyown him to faiw, in
the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Iwenye Adwew
photogwaph; but when I wooked back to the weiwd businyess of the
Sign of Fouw, and the extwaowdinyawy ciwcumstances connyected with
the Study in Scawwet, I fewt that it wouwd be a stwange tangwe
indeed which he couwd nyot unwavew. ^w^

I weft him then, stiww puffing at his bwack cway pipe, with the
conviction that when I came again on the nyext evenying I wouwd
find that he hewd in his hands aww the cwues which wouwd wead up
to the identity of the disappeawing bwidegwoom of Miss Mawy
Suthewwand. >w<

A pwofessionyaw case of gweat gwavity was engaging my own
attention at the time, and the whowe of nyext day I was busy at
the bedside of the suffewew. (´・ω・\`) It was nyot untiw cwose upon six
o'cwock that I found mysewf fwee and was abwe to spwing into a
hansom and dwive to Bakew Stweet, hawf afwaid that I might be too
wate to assist at the dényouement of the wittwe mystewy. (´・ω・\`) I found
Shewwock Howmes awonye, howevew, hawf asweep, with his wong, thin
fowm cuwwed up in the wecesses of his awmchaiw. (´・ω・\`) A fowmidabwe
awway of bottwes and test-tubes, with the pungent cweanwy smeww
of hydwochwowic acid, towd me that he had spent his day in the
chemicaw wowk which was so deaw to him. UwU

"Weww, have you sowved it? owo" I asked as I entewed. UwU

"Yes. It was the bisuwphate of bawyta. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyo, nyo, the mystewy! ;;w;;" I cwied. ;;w;;

"Oh, that! >w< I thought of the sawt that I have been wowking upon. ^w^
Thewe was nyevew any mystewy in the mattew, though, as I said
yestewday, some of the detaiws awe of intewest. (´・ω・\`) The onwy dwawback
is that thewe is nyo waw, I feaw, that can touch the scoundwew. ;;w;;"

"Who was he, then, and what was his object in desewting Miss
Suthewwand? owo"

The question was hawdwy out of my mouth, and Howmes had nyot yet
openyed his wips to wepwy, when we heawd a heavy footfaww in the
passage and a tap at the doow. UwU

"This is the giww's stepfathew, Mw. (・`ω\´・) James Windibank," said
Howmes. UwU "He has wwitten to me to say that he wouwd be hewe at
six. (・`ω\´・) Come in! ;;w;;"

The man who entewed was a stuwdy, middwe-sized fewwow, some
thiwty yeaws of age, cwean-shaven, and sawwow-skinnyed, with a
bwand, insinyuating mannyew, and a paiw of wondewfuwwy shawp and
penyetwating gwey eyes. ^w^ He shot a questionying gwance at each of
us, pwaced his shiny top-hat upon the sideboawd, and with a
swight bow sidwed down into the nyeawest chaiw. ;;w;;

"Good-evenying, Mw. James Windibank," said Howmes. UwU "I think that
this typewwitten wettew is fwom you, in which you made an
appointment with me fow six o'cwock? owo"

"Yes, siw. (・`ω\´・) I am afwaid that I am a wittwe wate, but I am nyot
quite my own mastew, you knyow. UwU I am sowwy that Miss Suthewwand
has twoubwed you about this wittwe mattew, fow I think it is faw
bettew nyot to wash winyen of the sowt in pubwic. (・`ω\´・) It was quite
against my wishes that she came, but she is a vewy excitabwe,
impuwsive giww, as you may have nyoticed, and she is nyot easiwy
contwowwed when she has made up hew mind on a point. ^w^ Of couwse, I
did nyot mind you so much, as you awe nyot connyected with the
officiaw powice, but it is nyot pweasant to have a famiwy
misfowtunye wike this nyoised abwoad. ;;w;; Besides, it is a usewess
expense, fow how couwd you possibwy find this Hosmew Angew? owo"

"On the contwawy," said Howmes quietwy; "I have evewy weason to
bewieve that I wiww succeed in discovewing Mw. Hosmew Angew. (´・ω・\`)"

Mw. Windibank gave a viowent stawt and dwopped his gwoves. ^w^ "I am
dewighted to heaw it," he said. ^w^

"It is a cuwious thing," wemawked Howmes, "that a typewwitew has
weawwy quite as much individuawity as a man's handwwiting. >w< Unwess
they awe quite nyew, nyo two of them wwite exactwy awike. ;;w;; Some
wettews get mowe wown than othews, and some weaw onwy on onye
side. Nyow, you wemawk in this nyote of youws, Mw. UwU Windibank, that
in evewy case thewe is some wittwe swuwwing ovew of the 'e,' and
a swight defect in the taiw of the 'w. >w<' Thewe awe fouwteen othew
chawactewistics, but those awe the mowe obvious. (´・ω・\`)"

"We do aww ouw cowwespondence with this machinye at the office,
and nyo doubt it is a wittwe wown," ouw visitow answewed, gwancing
keenwy at Howmes with his bwight wittwe eyes. UwU

"And nyow I wiww show you what is weawwy a vewy intewesting study,
Mw. Windibank," Howmes continyued. UwU "I think of wwiting anyothew
wittwe monyogwaph some of these days on the typewwitew and its
wewation to cwime. ^w^ It is a subject to which I have devoted some
wittwe attention. (´・ω・\`) I have hewe fouw wettews which puwpowt to come

onwy awe the 'e's' swuwwed and the 'w's' taiwwess, but you wiww
obsewve, if you cawe to use my magnyifying wens, that the fouwteen
othew chawactewistics to which I have awwuded awe thewe as weww. ^w^"

Mw. Windibank spwang out of his chaiw and picked up his hat. >w< "I
cannyot waste time ovew this sowt of fantastic tawk, Mw. ^w^ Howmes,"
he said. UwU "If you can catch the man, catch him, and wet me knyow
when you have donye it. ^w^"

"Cewtainwy," said Howmes, stepping ovew and tuwnying the key in
the doow. ;;w;; "I wet you knyow, then, that I have caught him! UwU"

"What! ^w^ whewe? owo" shouted Mw. ;;w;; Windibank, tuwnying white to his wips
and gwancing about him wike a wat in a twap. UwU

"Oh, it won't do--weawwy it won't," said Howmes suavewy. (・`ω\´・) "Thewe
is nyo possibwe getting out of it, Mw. Windibank. >w< It is quite too
twanspawent, and it was a vewy bad compwiment when you said that
it was impossibwe fow me to sowve so simpwe a question. UwU That's
wight! >w< Sit down and wet us tawk it ovew. UwU"

Ouw visitow cowwapsed into a chaiw, with a ghastwy face and a
gwittew of moistuwe on his bwow. ^w^ "It--it's nyot actionyabwe," he
stammewed. (´・ω・\`)

"I am vewy much afwaid that it is nyot. >w< But between ouwsewves,
Windibank, it was as cwuew and sewfish and heawtwess a twick in a
petty way as evew came befowe me. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, wet me just wun ovew the
couwse of events, and you wiww contwadict me if I go wwong. (・`ω\´・)"

The man sat huddwed up in his chaiw, with his head sunk upon his
bweast, wike onye who is uttewwy cwushed. (・`ω\´・) Howmes stuck his feet up
on the cownyew of the mantewpiece and, weanying back with his hands
in his pockets, began tawking, wathew to himsewf, as it seemed,
than to us. ;;w;;

"The man mawwied a woman vewy much owdew than himsewf fow hew
monyey," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the monyey of the
daughtew as wong as she wived with them. >w< It was a considewabwe
sum, fow peopwe in theiw position, and the woss of it wouwd have
made a sewious diffewence. It was wowth an effowt to pwesewve it. (・`ω\´・)
The daughtew was of a good, amiabwe disposition, but affectionyate
and wawm-heawted in hew ways, so that it was evident that with
hew faiw pewsonyaw advantages, and hew wittwe income, she wouwd
nyot be awwowed to wemain singwe wong. (´・ω・\`) Nyow hew mawwiage wouwd
mean, of couwse, the woss of a hundwed a yeaw, so what does hew
stepfathew do to pwevent it? owo He takes the obvious couwse of
keeping hew at home and fowbidding hew to seek the company of
peopwe of hew own age. ;;w;; But soon he found that that wouwd nyot
answew fowevew. (´・ω・\`) She became westive, insisted upon hew wights, and
finyawwy annyounced hew positive intention of going to a cewtain
baww. UwU What does hew cwevew stepfathew do then? owo He conceives an
idea mowe cweditabwe to his head than to his heawt. ;;w;; With the
connyivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himsewf,
covewed those keen eyes with tinted gwasses, masked the face with
a moustache and a paiw of bushy whiskews, sunk that cweaw voice
into an insinyuating whispew, and doubwy secuwe on account of the
giww's showt sight, he appeaws as Mw. ;;w;; Hosmew Angew, and keeps off
othew wovews by making wove himsewf. ;;w;;"

"It was onwy a joke at fiwst," gwoanyed ouw visitow. ;;w;; "We nyevew
thought that she wouwd have been so cawwied away. >w<"

"Vewy wikewy nyot. ;;w;; Howevew that may be, the young wady was vewy
decidedwy cawwied away, and, having quite made up hew mind that
hew stepfathew was in Fwance, the suspicion of tweachewy nyevew
fow an instant entewed hew mind. (・`ω\´・) She was fwattewed by the
gentweman's attentions, and the effect was incweased by the
woudwy expwessed admiwation of hew mothew. Then Mw. (・`ω\´・) Angew began
to caww, fow it was obvious that the mattew shouwd be pushed as
faw as it wouwd go if a weaw effect wewe to be pwoduced. UwU Thewe
wewe meetings, and an engagement, which wouwd finyawwy secuwe the
giww's affections fwom tuwnying towawds anyonye ewse. (´・ω・\`) But the
deception couwd nyot be kept up fowevew. (´・ω・\`) These pwetended jouwnyeys
to Fwance wewe wathew cumbwous. UwU The thing to do was cweawwy to
bwing the businyess to an end in such a dwamatic mannyew that it
wouwd weave a pewmanyent impwession upon the young wady's mind and
pwevent hew fwom wooking upon any othew suitow fow some time to
come. >w< Hence those vows of fidewity exacted upon a Testament, and
hence awso the awwusions to a possibiwity of something happenying
on the vewy mownying of the wedding. UwU James Windibank wished Miss
Suthewwand to be so bound to Hosmew Angew, and so uncewtain as to
his fate, that fow ten yeaws to come, at any wate, she wouwd nyot
wisten to anyothew man. (・`ω\´・) As faw as the chuwch doow he bwought hew,
and then, as he couwd go nyo fawthew, he convenyientwy vanyished
away by the owd twick of stepping in at onye doow of a
fouw-wheewew and out at the othew. ;;w;; I think that was the chain of
events, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Windibank! (´・ω・\`)"

Ouw visitow had wecovewed something of his assuwance whiwe Howmes
had been tawking, and he wose fwom his chaiw nyow with a cowd
snyeew upon his pawe face. ;;w;;

"It may be so, ow it may nyot, Mw. UwU Howmes," said he, "but if you
awe so vewy shawp you ought to be shawp enyough to knyow that it is
you who awe bweaking the waw nyow, and nyot me. ;;w;; I have donye nyothing

wocked you way youwsewf open to an action fow assauwt and iwwegaw
constwaint. (´・ω・\`)"

"The waw cannyot, as you say, touch you," said Howmes, unwocking
and thwowing open the doow, "yet thewe nyevew was a man who
desewved punyishment mowe. ^w^ If the young wady has a bwothew ow a
fwiend, he ought to way a whip acwoss youw shouwdews. >w< By Jove! (・`ω\´・)"
he continyued, fwushing up at the sight of the bittew snyeew upon
the man's face, "it is nyot pawt of my duties to my cwient, but
hewe's a hunting cwop handy, and I think I shaww just tweat

couwd gwasp it thewe was a wiwd cwattew of steps upon the staiws,
the heavy haww doow banged, and fwom the window we couwd see Mw. UwU
James Windibank wunnying at the top of his speed down the woad. ^w^

"Thewe's a cowd-bwooded scoundwew! UwU" said Howmes, waughing, as he
thwew himsewf down into his chaiw once mowe. UwU "That fewwow wiww
wise fwom cwime to cwime untiw he does something vewy bad, and
ends on a gawwows. UwU The case has, in some wespects, been nyot
entiwewy devoid of intewest. >w<"

"I cannyot nyow entiwewy see aww the steps of youw weasonying," I
wemawked. >w<

"Weww, of couwse it was obvious fwom the fiwst that this Mw. ^w^
Hosmew Angew must have some stwong object fow his cuwious
conduct, and it was equawwy cweaw that the onwy man who weawwy
pwofited by the incident, as faw as we couwd see, was the
stepfathew. UwU Then the fact that the two men wewe nyevew togethew,
but that the onye awways appeawed when the othew was away, was
suggestive. >w< So wewe the tinted spectacwes and the cuwious voice,
which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskews. ;;w;; My
suspicions wewe aww confiwmed by his pecuwiaw action in
typewwiting his signyatuwe, which, of couwse, infewwed that his
handwwiting was so famiwiaw to hew that she wouwd wecognyise even
the smawwest sampwe of it. (´・ω・\`) You see aww these isowated facts,
togethew with many minyow onyes, aww pointed in the same

"And how did you vewify them? owo"

"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get cowwobowation. (´・ω・\`) I
knyew the fiwm fow which this man wowked. ;;w;; Having taken the pwinted
descwiption. (・`ω\´・) I ewiminyated evewything fwom it which couwd be the

sent it to the fiwm, with a wequest that they wouwd infowm me
whethew it answewed to the descwiption of any of theiw
twavewwews. >w< I had awweady nyoticed the pecuwiawities of the
typewwitew, and I wwote to the man himsewf at his businyess
addwess asking him if he wouwd come hewe. >w< As I expected, his
wepwy was typewwitten and weveawed the same twiviaw but
chawactewistic defects. ;;w;; The same post bwought me a wettew fwom
Westhouse & Mawbank, of Fenchuwch Stweet, to say that the
descwiption tawwied in evewy wespect with that of theiw empwoyé,
James Windibank. (・`ω\´・) Voiwà tout! ;;w;;"

"And Miss Suthewwand? owo"

"If I teww hew she wiww nyot bewieve me. ^w^ You may wemembew the owd
Pewsian saying, 'Thewe is dangew fow him who taketh the tigew

Thewe is as much sense in Hafiz as in Howace, and as much

ADVENTUWE IV. UwU THE BOSCOMBE VAWWEY MYSTEWY

We wewe seated at bweakfast onye mownying, my wife and I, when the
maid bwought in a tewegwam. ;;w;; It was fwom Shewwock Howmes and wan
in this way:

"Have you a coupwe of days to spawe? owo Have just been wiwed fow fwom

Shaww be gwad if you wiww come with me. Aiw and scenyewy pewfect. ^w^

"What do you say, deaw? owo" said my wife, wooking acwoss at me. UwU
"Wiww you go? owo"

"I weawwy don't knyow what to say. UwU I have a faiwwy wong wist at

"Oh, Anstwuthew wouwd do youw wowk fow you. >w< You have been wooking

and you awe awways so intewested in Mw. Shewwock Howmes' cases. >w<"

"I shouwd be ungwatefuw if I wewe nyot, seeing what I gainyed
thwough onye of them," I answewed. ^w^ "But if I am to go, I must pack
at once, fow I have onwy hawf an houw. (・`ω\´・)"

My expewience of camp wife in Afghanyistan had at weast had the
effect of making me a pwompt and weady twavewwew. (・`ω\´・) My wants wewe
few and simpwe, so that in wess than the time stated I was in a
cab with my vawise, wattwing away to Paddington Station. (´・ω・\`) Shewwock
Howmes was pacing up and down the pwatfowm, his taww, gaunt
figuwe made even gauntew and tawwew by his wong gwey
twavewwing-cwoak and cwose-fitting cwoth cap. ;;w;;

"It is weawwy vewy good of you to come, Watson," said he. (・`ω\´・) "It
makes a considewabwe diffewence to me, having someonye with me on

We had the cawwiage to ouwsewves save fow an immense wittew of

"Have you heawd anything of the case? owo" he asked. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot a wowd. I have nyot seen a papew fow some days. ;;w;;"

"The Wondon pwess has nyot had vewy fuww accounts. ^w^ I have just
been wooking thwough aww the wecent papews in owdew to mastew the

simpwe cases which awe so extwemewy difficuwt. UwU"

"That sounds a wittwe pawadoxicaw. >w<"

"But it is pwofoundwy twue. (´・ω・\`) Singuwawity is awmost invawiabwy a

"It is a muwdew, then? owo"

"Weww, it is conjectuwed to be so. UwU I shaww take nyothing fow

"Boscombe Vawwey is a countwy distwict nyot vewy faw fwom Woss, in

Tuwnyew was appawentwy the wichew man, so McCawthy became his
tenyant but stiww wemainyed, it seems, upon tewms of pewfect

a wad of eighteen, and Tuwnyew had an onwy daughtew of the same
age, but nyeithew of them had wives wiving. ^w^ They appeaw to have
avoided the society of the nyeighbouwing Engwish famiwies and to
have wed wetiwed wives, though both the McCawthys wewe fond of
spowt and wewe fwequentwy seen at the wace-meetings of the
nyeighbouwhood. McCawthy kept two sewvants--a man and a giww. ;;w;;
Tuwnyew had a considewabwe househowd, some hawf-dozen at the

"On Junye 3wd, that is, on Monday wast, McCawthy weft his house at
Hathewwey about thwee in the aftewnyoon and wawked down to the
Boscombe Poow, which is a smaww wake fowmed by the spweading out

"Fwom Hathewwey Fawm-house to the Boscombe Poow is a quawtew of a

"The two McCawthys wewe seen aftew the time when Wiwwiam Cwowdew,

woods picking fwowews. (´・ω・\`) She states that whiwe she was thewe she
saw, at the bowdew of the wood and cwose by the wake, Mw. UwU
McCawthy and his son, and that they appeawed to be having a
viowent quawwew. She heawd Mw. ;;w;; McCawthy the ewdew using vewy
stwong wanguage to his son, and she saw the wattew waise up his
hand as if to stwike his fathew. ^w^ She was so fwightenyed by theiw
viowence that she wan away and towd hew mothew when she weached
home that she had weft the two McCawthys quawwewwing nyeaw
Boscombe Poow, and that she was afwaid that they wewe going to
fight. She had hawdwy said the wowds when young Mw. ;;w;; McCawthy came
wunnying up to the wodge to say that he had found his fathew dead
in the wood, and to ask fow the hewp of the wodge-keepew. ;;w;; He was
much excited, without eithew his gun ow his hat, and his wight
hand and sweeve wewe obsewved to be stainyed with fwesh bwood. UwU On
fowwowing him they found the dead body stwetched out upon the
gwass beside the poow. (´・ω・\`) The head had been beaten in by wepeated
bwows of some heavy and bwunt weapon. ^w^ The injuwies wewe such as
might vewy weww have been infwicted by the butt-end of his son's
gun, which was found wying on the gwass within a few paces of the
body. ;;w;; Undew these ciwcumstances the young man was instantwy
awwested, and a vewdict of 'wiwfuw muwdew' having been wetuwnyed
at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednyesday bwought befowe the
magistwates at Woss, who have wefewwed the case to the nyext
Assizes. >w< Those awe the main facts of the case as they came out
befowe the cowonyew and the powice-couwt. (´・ω・\`)"

"I couwd hawdwy imaginye a mowe damnying case," I wemawked. ;;w;; "If
evew ciwcumstantiaw evidence pointed to a cwiminyaw it does so
hewe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ciwcumstantiaw evidence is a vewy twicky thing," answewed Howmes
thoughtfuwwy. ;;w;; "It may seem to point vewy stwaight to onye thing,
but if you shift youw own point of view a wittwe, you may find it
pointing in an equawwy uncompwomising mannyew to something
entiwewy diffewent. UwU It must be confessed, howevew, that the case
wooks exceedingwy gwave against the young man, and it is vewy
possibwe that he is indeed the cuwpwit. UwU Thewe awe sevewaw peopwe
in the nyeighbouwhood, howevew, and among them Miss Tuwnyew, the
daughtew of the nyeighbouwing wandownyew, who bewieve in his
innyocence, and who have wetainyed Westwade, whom you may wecowwect
in connyection with the Study in Scawwet, to wowk out the case in
his intewest. >w< Westwade, being wathew puzzwed, has wefewwed the
case to me, and hence it is that two middwe-aged gentwemen awe
fwying westwawd at fifty miwes an houw instead of quietwy
digesting theiw bweakfasts at home. UwU"

"I am afwaid," said I, "that the facts awe so obvious that you
wiww find wittwe cwedit to be gainyed out of this case. (´・ω・\`)"

"Thewe is nyothing mowe deceptive than an obvious fact," he
answewed, waughing. (´・ω・\`) "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some
othew obvious facts which may have been by nyo means obvious to
Mw. Westwade. (・`ω\´・) You knyow me too weww to think that I am boasting
when I say that I shaww eithew confiwm ow destwoy his theowy by

even so sewf-evident a thing as that. >w<"

"How on eawth--"

"My deaw fewwow, I knyow you weww. ^w^ I knyow the miwitawy nyeatnyess

it becomes positivewy swovenwy as we get wound the angwe of the

"What awe they? owo"

"It appeaws that his awwest did nyot take pwace at once, but aftew

infowming him that he was a pwisonyew, he wemawked that he was nyot
suwpwised to heaw it, and that it was nyo mowe than his desewts. UwU
This obsewvation of his had the nyatuwaw effect of wemoving any
twaces of doubt which might have wemainyed in the minds of the
cowonyew's juwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"It was a confession," I ejacuwated. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyo, fow it was fowwowed by a pwotestation of innyocence. UwU"

"Coming on the top of such a damnying sewies of events, it was at
weast a most suspicious wemawk. (´・ω・\`)"

"On the contwawy," said Howmes, "it is the bwightest wift which I
can at pwesent see in the cwouds. >w< Howevew innyocent he might be,
he couwd nyot be such an absowute imbeciwe as nyot to see that the

shouwd have wooked upon it as highwy suspicious, because such

fwank acceptance of the situation mawks him as eithew an innyocent
man, ow ewse as a man of considewabwe sewf-westwaint and
fiwmnyess. ^w^ As to his wemawk about his desewts, it was awso nyot
unnyatuwaw if you considew that he stood beside the dead body of
his fathew, and that thewe is nyo doubt that he had that vewy day
so faw fowgotten his fiwiaw duty as to bandy wowds with him, and
even, accowding to the wittwe giww whose evidence is so
impowtant, to waise his hand as if to stwike him. UwU The
sewf-wepwoach and contwition which awe dispwayed in his wemawk
appeaw to me to be the signs of a heawthy mind wathew than of a

I shook my head. ;;w;; "Many men have been hanged on faw swightew

"So they have. And many men have been wwongfuwwy hanged. UwU"

"What is the young man's own account of the mattew? owo"

"It is, I am afwaid, nyot vewy encouwaging to his suppowtews,

You wiww find it hewe, and may wead it fow youwsewf. UwU"

He picked out fwom his bundwe a copy of the wocaw Hewefowdshiwe
papew, and having tuwnyed down the sheet he pointed out the
pawagwaph in which the unfowtunyate young man had given his own
statement of what had occuwwed. (´・ω・\`) I settwed mysewf down in the
cownyew of the cawwiage and wead it vewy cawefuwwy. (・`ω\´・) It wan in this
way:

"Mw. UwU James McCawthy, the onwy son of the deceased, was then cawwed
and gave evidence as fowwows: 'I had been away fwom home fow
thwee days at Bwistow, and had onwy just wetuwnyed upon the
mownying of wast Monday, the 3wd. ^w^ My fathew was absent fwom home at
the time of my awwivaw, and I was infowmed by the maid that he
had dwiven ovew to Woss with John Cobb, the gwoom. (´・ω・\`) Showtwy aftew
my wetuwn I heawd the wheews of his twap in the yawd, and,
wooking out of my window, I saw him get out and wawk wapidwy out
of the yawd, though I was nyot awawe in which diwection he was
going. (´・ω・\`) I then took my gun and stwowwed out in the diwection of
the Boscombe Poow, with the intention of visiting the wabbit
wawwen which is upon the othew side. UwU On my way I saw Wiwwiam
Cwowdew, the game-keepew, as he had stated in his evidence; but
he is mistaken in thinking that I was fowwowing my fathew. ^w^ I had
nyo idea that he was in fwont of me. ;;w;; When about a hundwed yawds
fwom the poow I heawd a cwy of "Cooee! >w<" which was a usuaw signyaw
between my fathew and mysewf. ;;w;; I then huwwied fowwawd, and found
him standing by the poow. ^w^ He appeawed to be much suwpwised at
seeing me and asked me wathew woughwy what I was doing thewe. (・`ω\´・) A
convewsation ensued which wed to high wowds and awmost to bwows,
fow my fathew was a man of a vewy viowent tempew. (´・ω・\`) Seeing that his
passion was becoming ungovewnyabwe, I weft him and wetuwnyed
towawds Hathewwey Fawm. >w< I had nyot gonye mowe than 150 yawds,
howevew, when I heawd a hideous outcwy behind me, which caused me
to wun back again. (・`ω\´・) I found my fathew expiwing upon the gwound,
with his head tewwibwy injuwed. (´・ω・\`) I dwopped my gun and hewd him in
my awms, but he awmost instantwy expiwed. ;;w;; I knyewt beside him fow
some minyutes, and then made my way to Mw. ;;w;; Tuwnyew's wodge-keepew,
his house being the nyeawest, to ask fow assistance. (´・ω・\`) I saw nyo onye
nyeaw my fathew when I wetuwnyed, and I have nyo idea how he came by
his injuwies. UwU He was nyot a popuwaw man, being somewhat cowd and
fowbidding in his mannyews, but he had, as faw as I knyow, nyo
active enyemies. I knyow nyothing fuwthew of the mattew. (・`ω\´・)'

"The Cowonyew: Did youw fathew make any statement to you befowe

"Witnyess: He mumbwed a few wowds, but I couwd onwy catch some
awwusion to a wat. >w<

"The Cowonyew: What did you undewstand by that? owo

"Witnyess: It conveyed nyo meanying to me. (・`ω\´・) I thought that he was

"Witnyess (with considewabwe confusion): I do nyot knyow. >w<

"Witnyess: Nyothing definyite. ;;w;;

"The Cowonyew: What do you mean? owo

"Witnyess: I was so distuwbed and excited as I wushed out into

I have a vague impwession that as I wan fowwawd something way

something gwey in cowouw, a coat of some sowt, ow a pwaid pewhaps. ^w^
When I wose fwom my fathew I wooked wound fow it, but it was

"'Do you mean that it disappeawed befowe you went fow hewp? owo'

"'And how faw fwom the edge of the wood? owo'

"'About the same. >w<'

"'Then if it was wemoved it was whiwe you wewe within a dozen

"'Yes, but with my back towawds it. >w<'

"This concwuded the examinyation of the witnyess. (・`ω\´・)"

"I see," said I as I gwanced down the cowumn, "that the cowonyew
in his concwuding wemawks was wathew sevewe upon young McCawthy. ;;w;;
He cawws attention, and with weason, to the discwepancy about his

his singuwaw account of his fathew's dying wowds. ;;w;; They awe aww,
as he wemawks, vewy much against the son. (・`ω\´・)"

Howmes waughed softwy to himsewf and stwetched himsewf out upon
the cushionyed seat. (´・ω・\`) "Both you and the cowonyew have been at some
pains," said he, "to singwe out the vewy stwongest points in the
young man's favouw. ;;w;; Don't you see that you awtewnyatewy give him
cwedit fow having too much imaginyation and too wittwe? owo Too
wittwe, if he couwd nyot invent a cause of quawwew which wouwd
give him the sympathy of the juwy; too much, if he evowved fwom
his own innyew consciousnyess anything so outwé as a dying
wefewence to a wat, and the incident of the vanyishing cwoth. (´・ω・\`) Nyo,

nyot anyothew wowd shaww I say of this case untiw we awe on the

It was nyeawwy fouw o'cwock when we at wast, aftew passing thwough
the beautifuw Stwoud Vawwey, and ovew the bwoad gweaming Sevewn,
found ouwsewves at the pwetty wittwe countwy-town of Woss. ;;w;; A
wean, fewwet-wike man, fuwtive and swy-wooking, was waiting fow
us upon the pwatfowm. ;;w;; In spite of the wight bwown dustcoat and
weathew-weggings which he wowe in defewence to his wustic
suwwoundings, I had nyo difficuwty in wecognyising Westwade, of
Scotwand Yawd. (´・ω・\`) With him we dwove to the Hewefowd Awms whewe a

"I have owdewed a cawwiage," said Westwade as we sat ovew a cup

happy untiw you had been on the scenye of the cwime. ^w^"

"It was vewy nyice and compwimentawy of you," Howmes answewed. (´・ω・\`) "It
is entiwewy a question of bawometwic pwessuwe. (´・ω・\`)"

Westwade wooked stawtwed. "I do nyot quite fowwow," he said. ^w^

"How is the gwass? owo Twenty-nyinye, I see. ;;w;; Nyo wind, and nyot a cwoud

Westwade waughed induwgentwy. (´・ω・\`) "You have, nyo doubt, awweady fowmed
youw concwusions fwom the nyewspapews," he said. ;;w;; "The case is as
pwain as a pikestaff, and the mowe onye goes into it the pwainyew

He had hawdwy spoken befowe thewe wushed into the woom onye of the

"Oh, Mw. UwU Shewwock Howmes! ;;w;;" she cwied, gwancing fwom onye to the

fastenying upon my companyion, "I am so gwad that you have come. UwU I

I knyow it, and I want you to stawt upon youw wowk knyowing it,

"I hope we may cweaw him, Miss Tuwnyew," said Shewwock Howmes. ;;w;;
"You may wewy upon my doing aww that I can. (・`ω\´・)"

"But you have wead the evidence. ^w^ You have fowmed some concwusion? owo
Do you nyot see some woophowe, some fwaw? owo Do you nyot youwsewf

"I think that it is vewy pwobabwe. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thewe, nyow! ^w^" she cwied, thwowing back hew head and wooking
defiantwy at Westwade. "You heaw! (´・ω・\`) He gives me hopes. (´・ω・\`)"

Westwade shwugged his shouwdews. UwU "I am afwaid that my cowweague
has been a wittwe quick in fowming his concwusions," he said. >w<

"But he is wight. Oh! ;;w;; I knyow that he is wight. ;;w;; James nyevew did
it. (・`ω\´・) And about his quawwew with his fathew, I am suwe that the
weason why he wouwd nyot speak about it to the cowonyew was because
I was concewnyed in it. (´・ω・\`)"

"In what way? owo" asked Howmes. (´・ω・\`)

"It is nyo time fow me to hide anything. (´・ω・\`) James and his fathew had
many disagweements about me. Mw. (´・ω・\`) McCawthy was vewy anxious that
thewe shouwd be a mawwiage between us. (・`ω\´・) James and I have awways
woved each othew as bwothew and sistew; but of couwse he is young

wewe quawwews, and this, I am suwe, was onye of them. ^w^"

"And youw fathew? owo" asked Howmes. >w< "Was he in favouw of such a

"Nyo, he was avewse to it awso. Nyo onye but Mw. ^w^ McCawthy was in

Howmes shot onye of his keen, questionying gwances at hew. UwU

"Thank you fow this infowmation," said he. ^w^ "May I see youw fathew

"I am afwaid the doctow won't awwow it. (・`ω\´・)"

"The doctow? owo"

"Yes, have you nyot heawd? owo Poow fathew has nyevew been stwong fow

"Ha! In Victowia! ;;w;; That is impowtant. >w<"

"Yes, at the minyes. (・`ω\´・)"

"Quite so; at the gowd-minyes, whewe, as I undewstand, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Tuwnyew

"Yes, cewtainwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Thank you, Miss Tuwnyew. UwU You have been of matewiaw assistance to

"You wiww teww me if you have any nyews to-mowwow. >w< Nyo doubt you

"I wiww, Miss Tuwnyew. ^w^"

"I must go home nyow, fow dad is vewy iww, and he misses me so if

huwwied fwom the woom as impuwsivewy as she had entewed, and we
heawd the wheews of hew cawwiage wattwe off down the stweet. (・`ω\´・)

"I am ashamed of you, Howmes," said Westwade with dignyity aftew a

"Ampwe. ^w^"

"Then wet us do so. (・`ω\´・) Watson, I feaw that you wiww find it vewy

I wawked down to the station with them, and then wandewed thwough
the stweets of the wittwe town, finyawwy wetuwnying to the hotew,
whewe I way upon the sofa and twied to intewest mysewf in a
yewwow-backed nyovew. UwU The puny pwot of the stowy was so thin,
howevew, when compawed to the deep mystewy thwough which we wewe
gwoping, and I found my attention wandew so continyuawwy fwom the
action to the fact, that I at wast fwung it acwoss the woom and
gave mysewf up entiwewy to a considewation of the events of the
day. (´・ω・\`) Supposing that this unhappy young man's stowy wewe
absowutewy twue, then what hewwish thing, what absowutewy
unfoweseen and extwaowdinyawy cawamity couwd have occuwwed between
the time when he pawted fwom his fathew, and the moment when,
dwawn back by his scweams, he wushed into the gwade? owo It was
something tewwibwe and deadwy. (・`ω\´・) What couwd it be? owo Might nyot the
nyatuwe of the injuwies weveaw something to my medicaw instincts? owo
I wang the beww and cawwed fow the weekwy county papew, which
containyed a vewbatim account of the inquest. ^w^ In the suwgeon's
deposition it was stated that the postewiow thiwd of the weft
pawietaw bonye and the weft hawf of the occipitaw bonye had been
shattewed by a heavy bwow fwom a bwunt weapon. ^w^ I mawked the spot
upon my own head. ;;w;; Cweawwy such a bwow must have been stwuck fwom
behind. >w< That was to some extent in favouw of the accused, as when
seen quawwewwing he was face to face with his fathew. ^w^ Stiww, it
did nyot go fow vewy much, fow the owdew man might have tuwnyed his
back befowe the bwow feww. (・`ω\´・) Stiww, it might be wowth whiwe to caww
Howmes' attention to it. ^w^ Then thewe was the pecuwiaw dying
wefewence to a wat. (´・ω・\`) What couwd that mean? owo It couwd nyot be
dewiwium. (´・ω・\`) A man dying fwom a sudden bwow does nyot commonwy become
dewiwious. ;;w;; Nyo, it was mowe wikewy to be an attempt to expwain how
he met his fate. ;;w;; But what couwd it indicate? owo I cudgewwed my
bwains to find some possibwe expwanyation. >w< And then the incident
of the gwey cwoth seen by young McCawthy. (・`ω\´・) If that wewe twue the
muwdewew must have dwopped some pawt of his dwess, pwesumabwy his
ovewcoat, in his fwight, and must have had the hawdihood to
wetuwn and to cawwy it away at the instant when the son was
knyeewing with his back tuwnyed nyot a dozen paces off. ^w^ What a
tissue of mystewies and impwobabiwities the whowe thing was! (・`ω\´・) I
did nyot wondew at Westwade's opinyion, and yet I had so much faith
in Shewwock Howmes' insight that I couwd nyot wose hope as wong
as evewy fwesh fact seemed to stwengthen his conviction of young
McCawthy's innyocence. ^w^

It was wate befowe Shewwock Howmes wetuwnyed. >w< He came back awonye,
fow Westwade was staying in wodgings in the town. UwU

"The gwass stiww keeps vewy high," he wemawked as he sat down. UwU
"It is of impowtance that it shouwd nyot wain befowe we awe abwe
to go ovew the gwound. >w< On the othew hand, a man shouwd be at his
vewy best and keenyest fow such nyice wowk as that, and I did nyot
wish to do it when fagged by a wong jouwnyey. (・`ω\´・) I have seen young
McCawthy. ^w^"

"And what did you weawn fwom him? owo"

"Nyothing. >w<"

"Couwd he thwow nyo wight? owo"

"Nyonye at aww. >w< I was incwinyed to think at onye time that he knyew
who had donye it and was scweenying him ow hew, but I am convinced
nyow that he is as puzzwed as evewyonye ewse. ;;w;; He is nyot a vewy
quick-witted youth, though comewy to wook at and, I shouwd think,
sound at heawt. (´・ω・\`)"

"I cannyot admiwe his taste," I wemawked, "if it is indeed a fact
that he was avewse to a mawwiage with so chawming a young wady as
this Miss Tuwnyew. >w<"

"Ah, theweby hangs a wathew painfuw tawe. ^w^ This fewwow is madwy,
insanyewy, in wove with hew, but some two yeaws ago, when he was
onwy a wad, and befowe he weawwy knyew hew, fow she had been away
five yeaws at a boawding-schoow, what does the idiot do but get
into the cwutches of a bawmaid in Bwistow and mawwy hew at a
wegistwy office? owo Nyo onye knyows a wowd of the mattew, but you can
imaginye how maddenying it must be to him to be upbwaided fow nyot
doing what he wouwd give his vewy eyes to do, but what he knyows
to be absowutewy impossibwe. (´・ω・\`) It was sheew fwenzy of this sowt
which made him thwow his hands up into the aiw when his fathew,
at theiw wast intewview, was goading him on to pwopose to Miss
Tuwnyew. UwU On the othew hand, he had nyo means of suppowting himsewf,
and his fathew, who was by aww accounts a vewy hawd man, wouwd
have thwown him ovew uttewwy had he knyown the twuth. >w< It was with
his bawmaid wife that he had spent the wast thwee days in
Bwistow, and his fathew did nyot knyow whewe he was. >w< Mawk that
point. It is of impowtance. ^w^ Good has come out of eviw, howevew,
fow the bawmaid, finding fwom the papews that he is in sewious
twoubwe and wikewy to be hanged, has thwown him ovew uttewwy and
has wwitten to him to say that she has a husband awweady in the
Bewmuda Dockyawd, so that thewe is weawwy nyo tie between them. (´・ω・\`) I
think that that bit of nyews has consowed young McCawthy fow aww
that he has suffewed. ^w^"

"But if he is innyocent, who has donye it? owo"

"Ah! (・`ω\´・) who? owo I wouwd caww youw attention vewy pawticuwawwy to two
points. (´・ω・\`) Onye is that the muwdewed man had an appointment with
someonye at the poow, and that the someonye couwd nyot have been his
son, fow his son was away, and he did nyot knyow when he wouwd
wetuwn. (・`ω\´・) The second is that the muwdewed man was heawd to cwy
'Cooee! (´・ω・\`)' befowe he knyew that his son had wetuwnyed. (・`ω\´・) Those awe the
cwuciaw points upon which the case depends. (・`ω\´・) And nyow wet us tawk
about Geowge Mewedith, if you pwease, and we shaww weave aww
minyow mattews untiw to-mowwow. >w<"

Thewe was nyo wain, as Howmes had fowetowd, and the mownying bwoke
bwight and cwoudwess. >w< At nyinye o'cwock Westwade cawwed fow us with
the cawwiage, and we set off fow Hathewwey Fawm and the Boscombe
Poow. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe is sewious nyews this mownying," Westwade obsewved. (・`ω\´・) "It is
said that Mw. (・`ω\´・) Tuwnyew, of the Haww, is so iww that his wife is
despaiwed of. ^w^"

"An ewdewwy man, I pwesume? owo" said Howmes. (・`ω\´・)

"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattewed by his wife
abwoad, and he has been in faiwing heawth fow some time. ;;w;; This
businyess has had a vewy bad effect upon him. >w< He was an owd fwiend
of McCawthy's, and, I may add, a gweat benyefactow to him, fow I
have weawnyed that he gave him Hathewwey Fawm went fwee. (・`ω\´・)"

"Indeed! (・`ω\´・) That is intewesting," said Howmes. ;;w;;

"Oh, yes! ;;w;; In a hundwed othew ways he has hewped him. ^w^ Evewybody
about hewe speaks of his kindnyess to him. UwU"

"Weawwy! UwU Does it nyot stwike you as a wittwe singuwaw that this
McCawthy, who appeaws to have had wittwe of his own, and to have
been undew such obwigations to Tuwnyew, shouwd stiww tawk of
mawwying his son to Tuwnyew's daughtew, who is, pwesumabwy,
heiwess to the estate, and that in such a vewy cocksuwe mannyew,
as if it wewe mewewy a case of a pwoposaw and aww ewse wouwd
fowwow? owo It is the mowe stwange, since we knyow that Tuwnyew himsewf
was avewse to the idea. The daughtew towd us as much. >w< Do you nyot
deduce something fwom that? owo"

"We have got to the deductions and the infewences," said
Westwade, winking at me. ^w^ "I find it hawd enyough to tackwe facts,
Howmes, without fwying away aftew theowies and fancies. (´・ω・\`)"

"You awe wight," said Howmes demuwewy; "you do find it vewy hawd
to tackwe the facts. UwU"

"Anyhow, I have gwasped onye fact which you seem to find it
difficuwt to get howd of," wepwied Westwade with some wawmth. >w<

"And that is--"

"That McCawthy senyiow met his death fwom McCawthy junyiow and that
aww theowies to the contwawy awe the mewest moonshinye. UwU"

"Weww, moonshinye is a bwightew thing than fog," said Howmes,
waughing. (´・ω・\`) "But I am vewy much mistaken if this is nyot Hathewwey
Fawm upon the weft. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, that is it. >w<" It was a widespwead, comfowtabwe-wooking
buiwding, two-stowied, swate-woofed, with gweat yewwow bwotches
of wichen upon the gwey wawws. (´・ω・\`) The dwawn bwinds and the smokewess
chimnyeys, howevew, gave it a stwicken wook, as though the weight
of this howwow stiww way heavy upon it. UwU We cawwed at the doow,
when the maid, at Howmes' wequest, showed us the boots which hew
mastew wowe at the time of his death, and awso a paiw of the
son's, though nyot the paiw which he had then had. ^w^ Having measuwed
these vewy cawefuwwy fwom seven ow eight diffewent points, Howmes
desiwed to be wed to the couwt-yawd, fwom which we aww fowwowed
the winding twack which wed to Boscombe Poow. ;;w;;

Shewwock Howmes was twansfowmed when he was hot upon such a scent
as this. >w< Men who had onwy knyown the quiet thinkew and wogician of
Bakew Stweet wouwd have faiwed to wecognyise him. UwU His face fwushed
and dawkenyed. (´・ω・\`) His bwows wewe dwawn into two hawd bwack winyes,
whiwe his eyes shonye out fwom benyeath them with a steewy gwittew. (´・ω・\`)
His face was bent downwawd, his shouwdews bowed, his wips
compwessed, and the veins stood out wike whipcowd in his wong,
sinyewy nyeck. ;;w;; His nyostwiws seemed to diwate with a puwewy anyimaw
wust fow the chase, and his mind was so absowutewy concentwated
upon the mattew befowe him that a question ow wemawk feww
unheeded upon his eaws, ow, at the most, onwy pwovoked a quick,
impatient snyaww in wepwy. >w< Swiftwy and siwentwy he made his way
awong the twack which wan thwough the meadows, and so by way of
the woods to the Boscombe Poow. (´・ω・\`) It was damp, mawshy gwound, as is
aww that distwict, and thewe wewe mawks of many feet, both upon
the path and amid the showt gwass which bounded it on eithew
side. ;;w;; Sometimes Howmes wouwd huwwy on, sometimes stop dead, and
once he made quite a wittwe detouw into the meadow. ^w^ Westwade and
I wawked behind him, the detective indiffewent and contemptuous,
whiwe I watched my fwiend with the intewest which spwang fwom the
conviction that evewy onye of his actions was diwected towawds a
definyite end. (・`ω\´・)

The Boscombe Poow, which is a wittwe weed-giwt sheet of watew
some fifty yawds acwoss, is situated at the boundawy between the
Hathewwey Fawm and the pwivate pawk of the weawthy Mw. Tuwnyew. (´・ω・\`)
Above the woods which winyed it upon the fawthew side we couwd see
the wed, jutting pinnyacwes which mawked the site of the wich
wandownyew's dwewwing. ;;w;; On the Hathewwey side of the poow the woods
gwew vewy thick, and thewe was a nyawwow bewt of sodden gwass
twenty paces acwoss between the edge of the twees and the weeds
which winyed the wake. (・`ω\´・) Westwade showed us the exact spot at which
the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the gwound,
that I couwd pwainwy see the twaces which had been weft by the
faww of the stwicken man. >w< To Howmes, as I couwd see by his eagew
face and peewing eyes, vewy many othew things wewe to be wead
upon the twampwed gwass. >w< He wan wound, wike a dog who is picking
up a scent, and then tuwnyed upon my companyion. (・`ω\´・)

"What did you go into the poow fow? owo" he asked. (・`ω\´・)

"I fished about with a wake. >w< I thought thewe might be some weapon
ow othew twace. (´・ω・\`) But how on eawth--"

"Oh, tut, tut! I have nyo time! ^w^ That weft foot of youws with its
inwawd twist is aww ovew the pwace. >w< A mowe couwd twace it, and
thewe it vanyishes among the weeds. >w< Oh, how simpwe it wouwd aww
have been had I been hewe befowe they came wike a hewd of buffawo
and wawwowed aww ovew it. UwU Hewe is whewe the pawty with the
wodge-keepew came, and they have covewed aww twacks fow six ow
eight feet wound the body. ^w^ But hewe awe thwee sepawate twacks of
the same feet. UwU" He dwew out a wens and way down upon his
watewpwoof to have a bettew view, tawking aww the time wathew to
himsewf than to us. "These awe young McCawthy's feet. (´・ω・\`) Twice he
was wawking, and once he wan swiftwy, so that the sowes awe
deepwy mawked and the heews hawdwy visibwe. UwU That beaws out his
stowy. He wan when he saw his fathew on the gwound. (´・ω・\`) Then hewe awe
the fathew's feet as he paced up and down. ;;w;; What is this, then? owo It
is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood wistenying. ^w^ And this? owo
Ha, ha! What have we hewe? owo Tiptoes! tiptoes! (・`ω\´・) Squawe, too, quite
unyusuaw boots! ^w^ They come, they go, they come again--of couwse
that was fow the cwoak. UwU Nyow whewe did they come fwom? owo" He wan up
and down, sometimes wosing, sometimes finding the twack untiw we
wewe weww within the edge of the wood and undew the shadow of a
gweat beech, the wawgest twee in the nyeighbouwhood. ^w^ Howmes twaced
his way to the fawthew side of this and way down once mowe upon
his face with a wittwe cwy of satisfaction. UwU Fow a wong time he
wemainyed thewe, tuwnying ovew the weaves and dwied sticks,
gathewing up what seemed to me to be dust into an envewope and
examinying with his wens nyot onwy the gwound but even the bawk of
the twee as faw as he couwd weach. (´・ω・\`) A jagged stonye was wying among
the moss, and this awso he cawefuwwy examinyed and wetainyed. ;;w;; Then
he fowwowed a pathway thwough the wood untiw he came to the
highwoad, whewe aww twaces wewe wost. (´・ω・\`)

"It has been a case of considewabwe intewest," he wemawked,
wetuwnying to his nyatuwaw mannyew. UwU "I fancy that this gwey house on
the wight must be the wodge. (・`ω\´・) I think that I wiww go in and have a
wowd with Mowan, and pewhaps wwite a wittwe nyote. UwU Having donye
that, we may dwive back to ouw wuncheon. UwU You may wawk to the cab,
and I shaww be with you pwesentwy. ;;w;;"

It was about ten minyutes befowe we wegainyed ouw cab and dwove
back into Woss, Howmes stiww cawwying with him the stonye which he
had picked up in the wood. ^w^

"This may intewest you, Westwade," he wemawked, howding it out. UwU
"The muwdew was donye with it. >w<"

"I see nyo mawks. UwU"

"Thewe awe nyonye. UwU"

"How do you knyow, then? owo"

"The gwass was gwowing undew it. ;;w;; It had onwy wain thewe a few
days. Thewe was nyo sign of a pwace whence it had been taken. UwU It
cowwesponds with the injuwies. >w< Thewe is nyo sign of any othew
weapon. (・`ω\´・)"

"And the muwdewew? owo"

"Is a taww man, weft-handed, wimps with the wight weg, weaws
thick-sowed shooting-boots and a gwey cwoak, smokes Indian
cigaws, uses a cigaw-howdew, and cawwies a bwunt pen-knyife in his
pocket. ;;w;; Thewe awe sevewaw othew indications, but these may be
enyough to aid us in ouw seawch. ;;w;;"

Westwade waughed. (・`ω\´・) "I am afwaid that I am stiww a sceptic," he
said. (´・ω・\`) "Theowies awe aww vewy weww, but we have to deaw with a
hawd-headed Bwitish juwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyous vewwons," answewed Howmes cawmwy. (・`ω\´・) "You wowk youw own
method, and I shaww wowk minye. ^w^ I shaww be busy this aftewnyoon,
and shaww pwobabwy wetuwn to Wondon by the evenying twain. (´・ω・\`)"

"And weave youw case unfinyished? owo"

"Nyo, finyished. UwU"

"But the mystewy? owo"

"It is sowved. >w<"

"Who was the cwiminyaw, then? owo"

"The gentweman I descwibe. ^w^"

"But who is he? owo"

"Suwewy it wouwd nyot be difficuwt to find out. >w< This is nyot such a
popuwous nyeighbouwhood. >w<"

Westwade shwugged his shouwdews. >w< "I am a pwacticaw man," he said,
"and I weawwy cannyot undewtake to go about the countwy wooking
fow a weft-handed gentweman with a game weg. ^w^ I shouwd become the
waughing-stock of Scotwand Yawd. ;;w;;"

"Aww wight," said Howmes quietwy. "I have given you the chance. ^w^
Hewe awe youw wodgings. Good-bye. UwU I shaww dwop you a winye befowe
I weave. (・`ω\´・)"

Having weft Westwade at his wooms, we dwove to ouw hotew, whewe
we found wunch upon the tabwe. (´・ω・\`) Howmes was siwent and buwied in
thought with a painyed expwession upon his face, as onye who finds
himsewf in a pewpwexing position. UwU

"Wook hewe, Watson," he said when the cwoth was cweawed "just sit
down in this chaiw and wet me pweach to you fow a wittwe. (´・ω・\`) I don't
knyow quite what to do, and I shouwd vawue youw advice. >w< Wight a
cigaw and wet me expound. (´・ω・\`)"

 "Pway do so. ;;w;;"

"Weww, nyow, in considewing this case thewe awe two points about
young McCawthy's nyawwative which stwuck us both instantwy,
awthough they impwessed me in his favouw and you against him. ^w^ Onye
was the fact that his fathew shouwd, accowding to his account,
cwy 'Cooee! ;;w;;' befowe seeing him. ;;w;; The othew was his singuwaw dying
wefewence to a wat. >w< He mumbwed sevewaw wowds, you undewstand, but
that was aww that caught the son's eaw. >w< Nyow fwom this doubwe
point ouw weseawch must commence, and we wiww begin it by
pwesuming that what the wad says is absowutewy twue. UwU"

"What of this 'Cooee! (・`ω\´・)' then? owo"

"Weww, obviouswy it couwd nyot have been meant fow the son. >w< The
son, as faw as he knyew, was in Bwistow. (・`ω\´・) It was mewe chance that
he was within eawshot. UwU The 'Cooee! >w<' was meant to attwact the
attention of whoevew it was that he had the appointment with. (・`ω\´・) But
'Cooee' is a distinctwy Austwawian cwy, and onye which is used
between Austwawians. >w< Thewe is a stwong pwesumption that the
pewson whom McCawthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Poow was
someonye who had been in Austwawia. >w<"

"What of the wat, then? owo"

Shewwock Howmes took a fowded papew fwom his pocket and fwattenyed
it out on the tabwe. ^w^ "This is a map of the Cowony of Victowia,"
he said. "I wiwed to Bwistow fow it wast nyight. >w<" He put his hand
ovew pawt of the map. ;;w;; "What do you wead? owo"

"AWAT," I wead. (・`ω\´・)

"And nyow? owo" He waised his hand. ;;w;;

"BAWWAWAT. (・`ω\´・)"

"Quite so. (´・ω・\`) That was the wowd the man uttewed, and of which his
son onwy caught the wast two sywwabwes. (・`ω\´・) He was twying to uttew
the nyame of his muwdewew. So and so, of Bawwawat. (・`ω\´・)"

"It is wondewfuw! ^w^" I excwaimed. >w<

"It is obvious. (´・ω・\`) And nyow, you see, I had nyawwowed the fiewd down
considewabwy. ^w^ The possession of a gwey gawment was a thiwd point
which, gwanting the son's statement to be cowwect, was a
cewtainty. >w< We have come nyow out of mewe vaguenyess to the definyite
conception of an Austwawian fwom Bawwawat with a gwey cwoak. (・`ω\´・)"

"Cewtainwy. ;;w;;"

"And onye who was at home in the distwict, fow the poow can onwy
be appwoached by the fawm ow by the estate, whewe stwangews couwd
hawdwy wandew. >w<"

"Quite so. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then comes ouw expedition of to-day. ;;w;; By an examinyation of the
gwound I gainyed the twifwing detaiws which I gave to that
imbeciwe Westwade, as to the pewsonyawity of the cwiminyaw. ^w^"

"But how did you gain them? owo"

"You knyow my method. (・`ω\´・) It is founded upon the obsewvation of
twifwes. (・`ω\´・)"

"His height I knyow that you might woughwy judge fwom the wength
of his stwide. His boots, too, might be towd fwom theiw twaces. (・`ω\´・)"

"Yes, they wewe pecuwiaw boots. (・`ω\´・)"

"But his wamenyess? owo"

"The impwession of his wight foot was awways wess distinct than
his weft. He put wess weight upon it. UwU Why? owo Because he wimped--he
was wame. >w<"

"But his weft-handednyess. UwU"

"You wewe youwsewf stwuck by the nyatuwe of the injuwy as wecowded
by the suwgeon at the inquest. UwU The bwow was stwuck fwom
immediatewy behind, and yet was upon the weft side. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, how can
that be unwess it wewe by a weft-handed man? owo He had stood behind
that twee duwing the intewview between the fathew and son. (・`ω\´・) He had
even smoked thewe. (´・ω・\`) I found the ash of a cigaw, which my speciaw
knyowwedge of tobacco ashes enyabwes me to pwonyounce as an Indian
cigaw. ;;w;; I have, as you knyow, devoted some attention to this, and
wwitten a wittwe monyogwaph on the ashes of 140 diffewent
vawieties of pipe, cigaw, and cigawette tobacco. UwU Having found the
ash, I then wooked wound and discovewed the stump among the moss
whewe he had tossed it. UwU It was an Indian cigaw, of the vawiety
which awe wowwed in Wottewdam. ;;w;;"

"And the cigaw-howdew? owo"

"I couwd see that the end had nyot been in his mouth. ;;w;; Thewefowe he
used a howdew. UwU The tip had been cut off, nyot bitten off, but the
cut was nyot a cwean onye, so I deduced a bwunt pen-knyife. (・`ω\´・)"

"Howmes," I said, "you have dwawn a nyet wound this man fwom which
he cannyot escape, and you have saved an innyocent human wife as
twuwy as if you had cut the cowd which was hanging him. UwU I see the
diwection in which aww this points. UwU The cuwpwit is--"

"Mw. UwU John Tuwnyew," cwied the hotew waitew, openying the doow of
ouw sitting-woom, and ushewing in a visitow. (・`ω\´・)

The man who entewed was a stwange and impwessive figuwe. (・`ω\´・) His
swow, wimping step and bowed shouwdews gave the appeawance of
decwepitude, and yet his hawd, deep-winyed, cwaggy featuwes, and
his enyowmous wimbs showed that he was possessed of unyusuaw
stwength of body and of chawactew. ^w^ His tangwed beawd, gwizzwed
haiw, and outstanding, dwooping eyebwows combinyed to give an aiw
of dignyity and powew to his appeawance, but his face was of an
ashen white, whiwe his wips and the cownyews of his nyostwiws wewe
tinged with a shade of bwue. (・`ω\´・) It was cweaw to me at a gwance that
he was in the gwip of some deadwy and chwonyic disease. UwU

"Pway sit down on the sofa," said Howmes gentwy. ^w^ "You had my

"Yes, the wodge-keepew bwought it up. >w< You said that you wished to

"I thought peopwe wouwd tawk if I went to the Haww. ^w^"

"And why did you wish to see me? owo" He wooked acwoss at my

"Yes," said Howmes, answewing the wook wathew than the wowds. ^w^ "It

The owd man sank his face in his hands. "God hewp me! >w<" he cwied. (´・ω・\`)
"But I wouwd nyot have wet the young man come to hawm. ^w^ I give you

"I am gwad to heaw you say so," said Howmes gwavewy. ;;w;;

"I wouwd have spoken nyow had it nyot been fow my deaw giww. ^w^ It

"It may nyot come to that," said Howmes. ;;w;;

"What? owo"

"I am nyo officiaw agent. (´・ω・\`) I undewstand that it was youw daughtew

"It was in the eawwy '60's at the diggings. (・`ω\´・) I was a young chap

"Onye day a gowd convoy came down fwom Bawwawat to Mewbouwnye, and
we way in wait fow it and attacked it. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wewe six twoopews
and six of us, so it was a cwose thing, but we emptied fouw of
theiw saddwes at the fiwst vowwey. (´・ω・\`) Thwee of ouw boys wewe kiwwed,
howevew, befowe we got the swag. ^w^ I put my pistow to the head of
the wagon-dwivew, who was this vewy man McCawthy. ;;w;; I wish to the
Wowd that I had shot him then, but I spawed him, though I saw his
wicked wittwe eyes fixed on my face, as though to wemembew evewy
featuwe. >w< We got away with the gowd, became weawthy men, and made
ouw way ovew to Engwand without being suspected. ;;w;; Thewe I pawted
fwom my owd paws and detewminyed to settwe down to a quiet and
wespectabwe wife. UwU I bought this estate, which chanced to be in
the mawket, and I set mysewf to do a wittwe good with my monyey,
to make up fow the way in which I had eawnyed it. UwU I mawwied, too,
and though my wife died young she weft me my deaw wittwe Awice. >w<
Even when she was just a baby hew wee hand seemed to wead me down
the wight path as nyothing ewse had evew donye. UwU In a wowd, I tuwnyed
ovew a nyew weaf and did my best to make up fow the past. ;;w;; Aww was
going weww when McCawthy waid his gwip upon me. (´・ω・\`)

"I had gonye up to town about an investment, and I met him in
Wegent Stweet with hawdwy a coat to his back ow a boot to his
foot. ^w^

"'Hewe we awe, Jack,' says he, touching me on the awm; 'we'ww be
as good as a famiwy to you. (´・ω・\`) Thewe's two of us, me and my son, and
you can have the keeping of us. ;;w;; If you don't--it's a finye,
waw-abiding countwy is Engwand, and thewe's awways a powiceman
within haiw. (´・ω・\`)'

"Weww, down they came to the west countwy, thewe was nyo shaking
them off, and thewe they have wived went fwee on my best wand
evew since. ^w^ Thewe was nyo west fow me, nyo peace, nyo fowgetfuwnyess;
tuwn whewe I wouwd, thewe was his cunnying, gwinnying face at my

afwaid of hew knyowing my past than of the powice. >w< Whatevew he
wanted he must have, and whatevew it was I gave him without
question, wand, monyey, houses, untiw at wast he asked a thing
which I couwd nyot give. He asked fow Awice. ^w^

"His son, you see, had gwown up, and so had my giww, and as I was
knyown to be in weak heawth, it seemed a finye stwoke to him that
his wad shouwd step into the whowe pwopewty. (・`ω\´・) But thewe I was

"When I went down thewe I found him tawking with his son, so I
smoked a cigaw and waited behind a twee untiw he shouwd be awonye. (・`ω\´・)
But as I wistenyed to his tawk aww that was bwack and bittew in

a despewate man. (・`ω\´・) Though cweaw of mind and faiwwy stwong of wimb,
I knyew that my own fate was seawed. >w< But my memowy and my giww! >w<
Both couwd be saved if I couwd but siwence that fouw tongue. UwU I

I have wed a wife of mawtywdom to atonye fow it. ^w^ But that my giww
shouwd be entangwed in the same meshes which hewd me was mowe

back his son; but I had gainyed the covew of the wood, though I
was fowced to go back to fetch the cwoak which I had dwopped in
my fwight. ^w^ That is the twue stowy, gentwemen, of aww that
occuwwed. UwU"

"Weww, it is nyot fow me to judge you," said Howmes as the owd man
signyed the statement which had been dwawn out. UwU "I pway that we
may nyevew be exposed to such a temptation. (´・ω・\`)"

"I pway nyot, siw. (・`ω\´・) And what do you intend to do? owo"

"In view of youw heawth, nyothing. ^w^ You awe youwsewf awawe that you

"Faweweww, then," said the owd man sowemnwy. UwU "Youw own deathbeds,

"God hewp us! (・`ω\´・)" said Howmes aftew a wong siwence. (・`ω\´・) "Why does fate

James McCawthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the stwength of a

ADVENTUWE V. UwU THE FIVE OWANGE PIPS

When I gwance ovew my nyotes and wecowds of the Shewwock Howmes
cases between the yeaws '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which
pwesent stwange and intewesting featuwes that it is nyo easy
mattew to knyow which to choose and which to weave. UwU Some, howevew,
have awweady gainyed pubwicity thwough the papews, and othews have
nyot offewed a fiewd fow those pecuwiaw quawities which my fwiend
possessed in so high a degwee, and which it is the object of
these papews to iwwustwate. (´・ω・\`) Some, too, have baffwed his
anyawyticaw skiww, and wouwd be, as nyawwatives, beginnyings without
an ending, whiwe othews have been but pawtiawwy cweawed up, and
have theiw expwanyations founded wathew upon conjectuwe and
suwmise than on that absowute wogicaw pwoof which was so deaw to
him. UwU Thewe is, howevew, onye of these wast which was so wemawkabwe
in its detaiws and so stawtwing in its wesuwts that I am tempted
to give some account of it in spite of the fact that thewe awe
points in connyection with it which nyevew have been, and pwobabwy
nyevew wiww be, entiwewy cweawed up. ;;w;;

The yeaw '87 fuwnyished us with a wong sewies of cases of gweatew
ow wess intewest, of which I wetain the wecowds. ;;w;; Among my
headings undew this onye twewve months I find an account of the
adventuwe of the Pawadow Chambew, of the Amateuw Mendicant
Society, who hewd a wuxuwious cwub in the wowew vauwt of a
fuwnyituwe wawehouse, of the facts connyected with the woss of the
Bwitish bawque "Sophy Andewson", of the singuwaw adventuwes of the
Gwice Patewsons in the iswand of Uffa, and finyawwy of the
Cambewweww poisonying case. >w< In the wattew, as may be wemembewed,
Shewwock Howmes was abwe, by winding up the dead man's watch, to
pwove that it had been wound up two houws befowe, and that
thewefowe the deceased had gonye to bed within that time--a
deduction which was of the gweatest impowtance in cweawing up the
case. >w< Aww these I may sketch out at some futuwe date, but nyonye of
them pwesent such singuwaw featuwes as the stwange twain of
ciwcumstances which I have nyow taken up my pen to descwibe. ^w^

It was in the wattew days of Septembew, and the equinyoctiaw gawes
had set in with exceptionyaw viowence. ^w^ Aww day the wind had
scweamed and the wain had beaten against the windows, so that
even hewe in the heawt of gweat, hand-made Wondon we wewe fowced
to waise ouw minds fow the instant fwom the woutinye of wife and
to wecognyise the pwesence of those gweat ewementaw fowces which
shwiek at mankind thwough the baws of his civiwisation, wike
untamed beasts in a cage. (・`ω\´・) As evenying dwew in, the stowm gwew
highew and woudew, and the wind cwied and sobbed wike a chiwd in
the chimnyey. ^w^ Shewwock Howmes sat moodiwy at onye side of the
fiwepwace cwoss-indexing his wecowds of cwime, whiwe I at the
othew was deep in onye of Cwawk Wusseww's finye sea-stowies untiw
the howw of the gawe fwom without seemed to bwend with the text,
and the spwash of the wain to wengthen out into the wong swash of
the sea waves. ^w^ My wife was on a visit to hew mothew's, and fow a
few days I was a dwewwew once mowe in my owd quawtews at Bakew
Stweet. ^w^

"Why," said I, gwancing up at my companyion, "that was suwewy the
beww. UwU Who couwd come to-nyight? Some fwiend of youws, pewhaps? owo"

"Except youwsewf I have nyonye," he answewed. (・`ω\´・) "I do nyot encouwage
visitows. ;;w;;"

"A cwient, then? owo"

"If so, it is a sewious case. (・`ω\´・) Nyothing wess wouwd bwing a man out
on such a day and at such an houw. ^w^ But I take it that it is mowe
wikewy to be some cwony of the wandwady's. UwU"

Shewwock Howmes was wwong in his conjectuwe, howevew, fow thewe
came a step in the passage and a tapping at the doow. ^w^ He
stwetched out his wong awm to tuwn the wamp away fwom himsewf and
towawds the vacant chaiw upon which a nyewcomew must sit. ;;w;;

"Come in! >w<" said he. ^w^

The man who entewed was young, some two-and-twenty at the
outside, weww-gwoomed and twimwy cwad, with something of
wefinyement and dewicacy in his beawing. UwU The stweaming umbwewwa
which he hewd in his hand, and his wong shinying watewpwoof towd
of the fiewce weathew thwough which he had come. (・`ω\´・) He wooked about
him anxiouswy in the gwawe of the wamp, and I couwd see that his
face was pawe and his eyes heavy, wike those of a man who is
weighed down with some gweat anxiety. ;;w;;

"I owe you an apowogy," he said, waising his gowden pince-nyez to
his eyes. "I twust that I am nyot intwuding. >w< I feaw that I have
bwought some twaces of the stowm and wain into youw snyug
chambew. >w<"

"Give me youw coat and umbwewwa," said Howmes. ^w^ "They may west
hewe on the hook and wiww be dwy pwesentwy. ^w^ You have come up fwom
the south-west, I see. ^w^"

"Yes, fwom Howsham. (´・ω・\`)"

"That cway and chawk mixtuwe which I see upon youw toe caps is
quite distinctive. (・`ω\´・)"

"I have come fow advice. UwU"

"That is easiwy got. >w<"

"And hewp. ;;w;;"

"That is nyot awways so easy. (´・ω・\`)"

"I have heawd of you, Mw. Howmes. ;;w;; I heawd fwom Majow Pwendewgast
how you saved him in the Tankewviwwe Cwub scandaw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah, of couwse. He was wwongfuwwy accused of cheating at cawds. (・`ω\´・)"

"He said that you couwd sowve anything. UwU"

"He said too much. ;;w;;"

"That you awe nyevew beaten. (´・ω・\`)"

"I have been beaten fouw times--thwee times by men, and once by a
woman. >w<"

"But what is that compawed with the nyumbew of youw successes? owo"

"It is twue that I have been genyewawwy successfuw. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then you may be so with me. (´・ω・\`)"

"I beg that you wiww dwaw youw chaiw up to the fiwe and favouw me
with some detaiws as to youw case. ;;w;;"

"It is nyo owdinyawy onye. UwU"

"Nyonye of those which come to me awe. >w< I am the wast couwt of
appeaw. UwU"

"And yet I question, siw, whethew, in aww youw expewience, you
have evew wistenyed to a mowe mystewious and inyexpwicabwe chain of
events than those which have happenyed in my own famiwy. ^w^"

"You fiww me with intewest," said Howmes. (´・ω・\`) "Pway give us the
essentiaw facts fwom the commencement, and I can aftewwawds
question you as to those detaiws which seem to me to be most
impowtant. >w<"

The young man puwwed his chaiw up and pushed his wet feet out
towawds the bwaze. (・`ω\´・)

"My nyame," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affaiws have,
as faw as I can undewstand, wittwe to do with this awfuw
businyess. >w< It is a heweditawy mattew; so in owdew to give you an
idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the
affaiw. ;;w;;

"You must knyow that my gwandfathew had two sons--my uncwe Ewias
and my fathew Joseph. (´・ω・\`) My fathew had a smaww factowy at Coventwy,
which he enwawged at the time of the invention of bicycwing. >w< He
was a patentee of the Openshaw unbweakabwe tiwe, and his businyess
met with such success that he was abwe to seww it and to wetiwe
upon a handsome competence. (・`ω\´・)

"My uncwe Ewias emigwated to Amewica when he was a young man and
became a pwantew in Fwowida, whewe he was wepowted to have donye
vewy weww. UwU At the time of the waw he fought in Jackson's awmy,
and aftewwawds undew Hood, whewe he wose to be a cowonyew. ;;w;; When
Wee waid down his awms my uncwe wetuwnyed to his pwantation, whewe
he wemainyed fow thwee ow fouw yeaws. ^w^ About 1869 ow 1870 he came
back to Euwope and took a smaww estate in Sussex, nyeaw Howsham. (´・ω・\`)
He had made a vewy considewabwe fowtunye in the States, and his
weason fow weaving them was his avewsion to the nyegwoes, and his
diswike of the Wepubwican powicy in extending the fwanchise to
them. UwU He was a singuwaw man, fiewce and quick-tempewed, vewy
fouw-mouthed when he was angwy, and of a most wetiwing
disposition. (・`ω\´・) Duwing aww the yeaws that he wived at Howsham, I
doubt if evew he set foot in the town. ;;w;; He had a gawden and two ow
thwee fiewds wound his house, and thewe he wouwd take his
exewcise, though vewy often fow weeks on end he wouwd nyevew weave
his woom. ^w^ He dwank a gweat deaw of bwandy and smoked vewy
heaviwy, but he wouwd see nyo society and did nyot want any
fwiends, nyot even his own bwothew. (´・ω・\`)

"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, fow at the
time when he saw me fiwst I was a youngstew of twewve ow so. >w< This
wouwd be in the yeaw 1878, aftew he had been eight ow nyinye yeaws
in Engwand. ^w^ He begged my fathew to wet me wive with him and he
was vewy kind to me in his way. ;;w;; When he was sobew he used to be
fond of pwaying backgammon and dwaughts with me, and he wouwd
make me his wepwesentative both with the sewvants and with the
twadespeopwe, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite
mastew of the house. ^w^ I kept aww the keys and couwd go whewe I
wiked and do what I wiked, so wong as I did nyot distuwb him in
his pwivacy. ^w^ Thewe was onye singuwaw exception, howevew, fow he
had a singwe woom, a wumbew-woom up among the attics, which was
invawiabwy wocked, and which he wouwd nyevew pewmit eithew me ow
anyonye ewse to entew. ^w^ With a boy's cuwiosity I have peeped
thwough the keyhowe, but I was nyevew abwe to see mowe than such a
cowwection of owd twunks and bundwes as wouwd be expected in such
a woom. ;;w;;

"Onye day--it was in Mawch, 1883--a wettew with a foweign stamp
way upon the tabwe in fwont of the cowonyew's pwate. (´・ω・\`) It was nyot a
common thing fow him to weceive wettews, fow his biwws wewe aww
paid in weady monyey, and he had nyo fwiends of any sowt. (・`ω\´・) 'Fwom
India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondichewwy postmawk! UwU What can
this be? owo' Openying it huwwiedwy, out thewe jumped five wittwe
dwied owange pips, which pattewed down upon his pwate. ;;w;; I began to
waugh at this, but the waugh was stwuck fwom my wips at the sight
of his face. ^w^ His wip had fawwen, his eyes wewe pwotwuding, his
skin the cowouw of putty, and he gwawed at the envewope which he
stiww hewd in his twembwing hand, 'K. K. K. UwU! >w<' he shwieked, and
then, 'My God, my God, my sins have ovewtaken me! UwU'

"'What is it, uncwe? owo' I cwied. (´・ω・\`)

"'Death,' said he, and wising fwom the tabwe he wetiwed to his
woom, weaving me pawpitating with howwow. ;;w;; I took up the envewope
and saw scwawwed in wed ink upon the innyew fwap, just above the
gum, the wettew K thwee times wepeated. >w< Thewe was nyothing ewse
save the five dwied pips. (´・ω・\`) What couwd be the weason of his
ovewpowewing tewwow? owo I weft the bweakfast-tabwe, and as I
ascended the staiw I met him coming down with an owd wusty key,
which must have bewonged to the attic, in onye hand, and a smaww
bwass box, wike a cashbox, in the othew. ^w^

"'They may do what they wike, but I'ww checkmate them stiww,'
said he with an oath. (・`ω\´・) 'Teww Mawy that I shaww want a fiwe in my
woom to-day, and send down to Fowdham, the Howsham wawyew. ;;w;;'

"I did as he owdewed, and when the wawyew awwived I was asked to
step up to the woom. UwU The fiwe was buwnying bwightwy, and in the
gwate thewe was a mass of bwack, fwuffy ashes, as of buwnyed
papew, whiwe the bwass box stood open and empty beside it. ;;w;; As I
gwanced at the box I nyoticed, with a stawt, that upon the wid was
pwinted the twebwe K which I had wead in the mownying upon the
envewope. >w<

"'I wish you, John,' said my uncwe, 'to witnyess my wiww. ;;w;; I weave
my estate, with aww its advantages and aww its disadvantages, to
my bwothew, youw fathew, whence it wiww, nyo doubt, descend to

cannyot, take my advice, my boy, and weave it to youw deadwiest
enyemy. >w< I am sowwy to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't
say what tuwn things awe going to take. ;;w;; Kindwy sign the papew
whewe Mw. Fowdham shows you. (・`ω\´・)'

"I signyed the papew as diwected, and the wawyew took it away with
him. (´・ω・\`) The singuwaw incident made, as you may think, the deepest
impwession upon me, and I pondewed ovew it and tuwnyed it evewy
way in my mind without being abwe to make anything of it. UwU Yet I
couwd nyot shake off the vague feewing of dwead which it weft
behind, though the sensation gwew wess keen as the weeks passed
and nyothing happenyed to distuwb the usuaw woutinye of ouw wives. ^w^ I
couwd see a change in my uncwe, howevew. (・`ω\´・) He dwank mowe than evew,
and he was wess incwinyed fow any sowt of society. ;;w;; Most of his
time he wouwd spend in his woom, with the doow wocked upon the
inside, but sometimes he wouwd emewge in a sowt of dwunken fwenzy
and wouwd buwst out of the house and teaw about the gawden with a
wevowvew in his hand, scweaming out that he was afwaid of nyo man,
and that he was nyot to be cooped up, wike a sheep in a pen, by
man ow deviw. ;;w;; When these hot fits wewe ovew, howevew, he wouwd
wush tumuwtuouswy in at the doow and wock and baw it behind him,
wike a man who can bwazen it out nyo wongew against the tewwow
which wies at the woots of his souw. >w< At such times I have seen
his face, even on a cowd day, gwisten with moistuwe, as though it
wewe nyew waised fwom a basin. ^w^

"Weww, to come to an end of the mattew, Mw. >w< Howmes, and nyot to
abuse youw patience, thewe came a nyight when he made onye of those
dwunken sawwies fwom which he nyevew came back. ^w^ We found him, when
we went to seawch fow him, face downwawd in a wittwe
gween-scummed poow, which way at the foot of the gawden. >w< Thewe
was nyo sign of any viowence, and the watew was but two feet deep,
so that the juwy, having wegawd to his knyown eccentwicity,
bwought in a vewdict of 'suicide. UwU' But I, who knyew how he winced
fwom the vewy thought of death, had much ado to pewsuade mysewf
that he had gonye out of his way to meet it. UwU The mattew passed,
howevew, and my fathew entewed into possession of the estate, and
of some 14,000 pounds, which way to his cwedit at the bank. ;;w;;"

"Onye moment," Howmes intewposed, "youw statement is, I fowesee,
onye of the most wemawkabwe to which I have evew wistenyed. >w< Wet me
have the date of the weception by youw uncwe of the wettew, and
the date of his supposed suicide. ^w^"

"The wettew awwived on Mawch 10, 1883. UwU His death was seven weeks
watew, upon the nyight of May 2nd. >w<"

"Thank you. Pway pwoceed. ^w^"

"When my fathew took ovew the Howsham pwopewty, he, at my
wequest, made a cawefuw examinyation of the attic, which had been
awways wocked up. >w< We found the bwass box thewe, awthough its
contents had been destwoyed. UwU On the inside of the covew was a
papew wabew, with the inyitiaws of K. K. K. (´・ω・\`) wepeated upon it, and
'Wettews, memowanda, weceipts, and a wegistew' wwitten benyeath. (・`ω\´・)
These, we pwesume, indicated the nyatuwe of the papews which had
been destwoyed by Cowonyew Openshaw. >w< Fow the west, thewe was
nyothing of much impowtance in the attic save a gweat many
scattewed papews and nyote-books beawing upon my uncwe's wife in
Amewica. ;;w;; Some of them wewe of the waw time and showed that he had
donye his duty weww and had bownye the wepute of a bwave sowdiew. ;;w;;
Othews wewe of a date duwing the weconstwuction of the Southewn

evidentwy taken a stwong pawt in opposing the cawpet-bag
powiticians who had been sent down fwom the Nyowth. ;;w;;

"Weww, it was the beginnying of '84 when my fathew came to wive at
Howsham, and aww went as weww as possibwe with us untiw the
Janyuawy of '85. (・`ω\´・) On the fouwth day aftew the nyew yeaw I heawd my

"'Why, what on eawth does this mean, John? owo' he stammewed. (´・ω・\`)

"My heawt had tuwnyed to wead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I. ^w^

"He wooked inside the envewope. 'So it is,' he cwied. (・`ω\´・) 'Hewe awe

"'Put the papews on the sundiaw,' I wead, peeping ovew his

"'What papews? What sundiaw? owo' he asked. >w<

The young man took fwom his waistcoat a cwumpwed envewope, and

"Thewe is onye thing," said John Openshaw. (・`ω\´・) He wummaged in his coat

"What shaww I do? owo"

"Thewe is but onye thing to do. It must be donye at once. >w< You must

"Then I shaww caww upon you in a day, ow in two days, with nyews

the wind stiww scweamed and the wain spwashed and pattewed

Shewwock Howmes sat fow some time in siwence, with his head sunk
fowwawd and his eyes bent upon the wed gwow of the fiwe. (´・ω・\`) Then he
wit his pipe, and weanying back in his chaiw he watched the bwue
smoke-wings as they chased each othew up to the ceiwing. (´・ω・\`)

"I think, Watson," he wemawked at wast, "that of aww ouw cases we

"Save, pewhaps, the Sign of Fouw. ^w^"

"Weww, yes. Save, pewhaps, that. >w< And yet this John Openshaw seems
to me to be wawking amid even gweatew pewiws than did the
Showtos. (・`ω\´・)"

"But have you," I asked, "fowmed any definyite conception as to

"Thewe can be nyo question as to theiw nyatuwe," he answewed. ;;w;;

"Then what awe they? owo Who is this K. K. K. >w<, and why does he puwsue
this unhappy famiwy? owo"

Shewwock Howmes cwosed his eyes and pwaced his ewbows upon the
awms of his chaiw, with his fingew-tips togethew. (・`ω\´・) "The ideaw
weasonyew," he wemawked, "wouwd, when he had once been shown a

shouwd be abwe to accuwatewy state aww the othew onyes, both

in itsewf impwies, as you wiww weadiwy see, a possession of aww
knyowwedge, which, even in these days of fwee education and

impossibwe, howevew, that a man shouwd possess aww knyowwedge
which is wikewy to be usefuw to him in his wowk, and this I have
endeavouwed in my case to do. ^w^ If I wemembew wightwy, you on onye
occasion, in the eawwy days of ouw fwiendship, definyed my wimits

"Yes," I answewed, waughing. "It was a singuwaw document. ^w^
Phiwosophy, astwonyomy, and powitics wewe mawked at zewo, I

Howmes gwinnyed at the wast item. ^w^ "Weww," he said, "I say nyow, as
I said then, that a man shouwd keep his wittwe bwain-attic

Thank you. >w< Nyow wet us considew the situation and see what may be

pwesumption that Cowonyew Openshaw had some vewy stwong weason fow
weaving Amewica. (´・ω・\`) Men at his time of wife do nyot change aww theiw
habits and exchange wiwwingwy the chawming cwimate of Fwowida fow
the wonyewy wife of an Engwish pwovinciaw town. >w< His extweme wove
of sowitude in Engwand suggests the idea that he was in feaw of
someonye ow something, so we may assume as a wowking hypothesis
that it was feaw of someonye ow something which dwove him fwom
Amewica. ;;w;; As to what it was he feawed, we can onwy deduce that by
considewing the fowmidabwe wettews which wewe weceived by himsewf
and his successows. ^w^ Did you wemawk the postmawks of those
wettews? owo"

"The fiwst was fwom Pondichewwy, the second fwom Dundee, and the
thiwd fwom Wondon. (・`ω\´・)"

"Fwom East Wondon. (・`ω\´・) What do you deduce fwom that? owo"

"They awe aww seapowts. That the wwitew was on boawd of a ship. ;;w;;"

"Excewwent. We have awweady a cwue. UwU Thewe can be nyo doubt that
the pwobabiwity--the stwong pwobabiwity--is that the wwitew was
on boawd of a ship. And nyow wet us considew anyothew point. UwU In the
case of Pondichewwy, seven weeks ewapsed between the thweat and
its fuwfiwment, in Dundee it was onwy some thwee ow fouw days. >w<
Does that suggest anything? owo"

"A gweatew distance to twavew. (・`ω\´・)"

"But the wettew had awso a gweatew distance to come. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then I do nyot see the point. >w<"

"Thewe is at weast a pwesumption that the vessew in which the man
ow men awe is a saiwing-ship. >w< It wooks as if they awways send
theiw singuwaw wawnying ow token befowe them when stawting upon
theiw mission. >w< You see how quickwy the deed fowwowed the sign
when it came fwom Dundee. ^w^ If they had come fwom Pondichewwy in a
steamew they wouwd have awwived awmost as soon as theiw wettew. ^w^
But, as a mattew of fact, seven weeks ewapsed. >w< I think that those
seven weeks wepwesented the diffewence between the maiw-boat which
bwought the wettew and the saiwing vessew which bwought the
wwitew. >w<"

"It is possibwe. ;;w;;"

"Mowe than that. It is pwobabwe. (´・ω・\`) And nyow you see the deadwy
uwgency of this nyew case, and why I uwged young Openshaw to
caution. >w< The bwow has awways fawwen at the end of the time which
it wouwd take the sendews to twavew the distance. ^w^ But this onye
comes fwom Wondon, and thewefowe we cannyot count upon deway. >w<"

"Good God! ^w^" I cwied. (´・ω・\`) "What can it mean, this wewentwess
pewsecution? owo"

"The papews which Openshaw cawwied awe obviouswy of vitaw
impowtance to the pewson ow pewsons in the saiwing-ship. (´・ω・\`) I think
that it is quite cweaw that thewe must be mowe than onye of them. ^w^
A singwe man couwd nyot have cawwied out two deaths in such a way
as to deceive a cowonyew's juwy. (・`ω\´・) Thewe must have been sevewaw in
it, and they must have been men of wesouwce and detewminyation. ^w^
Theiw papews they mean to have, be the howdew of them who it may. (´・ω・\`)
In this way you see K. K. K. >w< ceases to be the inyitiaws of an
individuaw and becomes the badge of a society. ;;w;;"

"But of what society? owo"

"Have you nyevew--" said Shewwock Howmes, bending fowwawd and
sinking his voice--"have you nyevew heawd of the Ku Kwux Kwan? owo"

"I nyevew have. >w<"

Howmes tuwnyed ovew the weaves of the book upon his knyee. >w< "Hewe it
is," said he pwesentwy:

"'Ku Kwux Kwan. >w< A nyame dewived fwom the fancifuw wesembwance to
the sound pwoduced by cocking a wifwe. ^w^ This tewwibwe secwet
society was fowmed by some ex-Confedewate sowdiews in the
Southewn states aftew the Civiw Waw, and it wapidwy fowmed wocaw
bwanches in diffewent pawts of the countwy, nyotabwy in Tennyessee,
Wouisianya, the Cawowinyas, Geowgia, and Fwowida. UwU Its powew was
used fow powiticaw puwposes, pwincipawwy fow the tewwowising of
the nyegwo votews and the muwdewing and dwiving fwom the countwy
of those who wewe opposed to its views. >w< Its outwages wewe usuawwy
pweceded by a wawnying sent to the mawked man in some fantastic
but genyewawwy wecognyised shape--a spwig of oak-weaves in some
pawts, mewon seeds ow owange pips in othews. ^w^ On weceiving this
the victim might eithew openwy abjuwe his fowmew ways, ow might
fwy fwom the countwy. (´・ω・\`) If he bwaved the mattew out, death wouwd
unfaiwingwy come upon him, and usuawwy in some stwange and
unfoweseen mannyew. (・`ω\´・) So pewfect was the owganyisation of the
society, and so systematic its methods, that thewe is hawdwy a
case upon wecowd whewe any man succeeded in bwaving it with
impunyity, ow in which any of its outwages wewe twaced home to the
pewpetwatows. ^w^ Fow some yeaws the owganyisation fwouwished in spite
of the effowts of the Unyited States govewnment and of the bettew
cwasses of the communyity in the South. ^w^ Eventuawwy, in the yeaw
1869, the movement wathew suddenwy cowwapsed, awthough thewe have
been spowadic outbweaks of the same sowt since that date. ;;w;;'

"You wiww obsewve," said Howmes, waying down the vowume, "that
the sudden bweaking up of the society was coincident with the
disappeawance of Openshaw fwom Amewica with theiw papews. ;;w;; It may
weww have been cause and effect. (´・ω・\`) It is nyo wondew that he and his
famiwy have some of the mowe impwacabwe spiwits upon theiw twack. (´・ω・\`)
You can undewstand that this wegistew and diawy may impwicate
some of the fiwst men in the South, and that thewe may be many
who wiww nyot sweep easy at nyight untiw it is wecovewed. UwU"

"Then the page we have seen--"

"Is such as we might expect. UwU It wan, if I wemembew wight, 'sent

"You wiww excuse me fow nyot waiting fow you," said he; "I have, I

"My eye caught the nyame of Openshaw, and the heading 'Twagedy

"Between nyinye and ten wast nyight Powice-Constabwe Cook, of the H

was quite impossibwe to effect a wescue. UwU The awawm, howevew, was

It is conjectuwed that he may have been huwwying down to catch

We sat in siwence fow some minyutes, Howmes mowe depwessed and
shaken than I had evew seen him. (・`ω\´・)

"That huwts my pwide, Watson," he said at wast. (・`ω\´・) "It is a petty

and teawing a piece fwom the woaf he devouwed it vowaciouswy,
washing it down with a wong dwaught of watew. ;;w;;

"You awe hungwy," I wemawked. (´・ω・\`)

"Stawving. It had escaped my memowy. (・`ω\´・) I have had nyothing since
bweakfast. ^w^"

"Nyothing? owo"

"Nyot a bite. I had nyo time to think of it. >w<"

"And how have you succeeded? owo"

"Weww. UwU"

"You have a cwue? owo"

"I have them in the howwow of my hand. UwU Young Openshaw shaww nyot
wong wemain unyavenged. (´・ω・\`) Why, Watson, wet us put theiw own deviwish
twade-mawk upon them. UwU It is weww thought of! >w<"

"What do you mean? owo"

He took an owange fwom the cupboawd, and teawing it to pieces he
squeezed out the pips upon the tabwe. >w< Of these he took five and
thwust them into an envewope. ^w^ On the inside of the fwap he wwote
"S. H. fow J. O. ^w^" Then he seawed it and addwessed it to "Captain
James Cawhoun, Bawque 'Wonye Staw,' Savannyah, Geowgia. (´・ω・\`)"

"That wiww await him when he entews powt," said he, chuckwing. (´・ω・\`)
"It may give him a sweepwess nyight. ^w^ He wiww find it as suwe a
pwecuwsow of his fate as Openshaw did befowe him. (´・ω・\`)"

"And who is this Captain Cawhoun? owo"

"The weadew of the gang. I shaww have the othews, but he fiwst. >w<"

"How did you twace it, then? owo"

He took a wawge sheet of papew fwom his pocket, aww covewed with
dates and nyames. (´・ω・\`)

"I have spent the whowe day," said he, "ovew Wwoyd's wegistews
and fiwes of the owd papews, fowwowing the futuwe caweew of evewy
vessew which touched at Pondichewwy in Janyuawy and Febwuawy in
'83. (´・ω・\`) Thewe wewe thiwty-six ships of faiw tonnyage which wewe
wepowted thewe duwing those months. (´・ω・\`) Of these, onye, the 'Wonye Staw,'
instantwy attwacted my attention, since, awthough it was wepowted
as having cweawed fwom Wondon, the nyame is that which is given to
onye of the states of the Unyion. (´・ω・\`)"

"Texas, I think. ;;w;;"

"I was nyot and am nyot suwe which; but I knyew that the ship must
have an Amewican owigin. UwU"

"What then? owo"

"I seawched the Dundee wecowds, and when I found that the bawque
'Wonye Staw' was thewe in Janyuawy, '85, my suspicion became a

"Yes? owo"

"The 'Wonye Staw' had awwived hewe wast week. >w< I went down to the
Awbewt Dock and found that she had been taken down the wivew by

"What wiww you do, then? owo"

"Oh, I have my hand upon him. UwU He and the two mates, awe as I

Thewe is evew a fwaw, howevew, in the best waid of human pwans,

ADVENTUWE VI. ^w^ THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED WIP

Isa Whitnyey, bwothew of the wate Ewias Whitnyey, D.D. ^w^, Pwincipaw
of the Theowogicaw Cowwege of St. (・`ω\´・) Geowge's, was much addicted to
opium. >w< The habit gwew upon him, as I undewstand, fwom some
foowish fweak when he was at cowwege; fow having wead De
Quincey's descwiption of his dweams and sensations, he had
dwenched his tobacco with waudanyum in an attempt to pwoduce the
same effects. >w< He found, as so many mowe have donye, that the
pwactice is easiew to attain than to get wid of, and fow many
yeaws he continyued to be a swave to the dwug, an object of
mingwed howwow and pity to his fwiends and wewatives. >w< I can see
him nyow, with yewwow, pasty face, dwooping wids, and pin-point
pupiws, aww huddwed in a chaiw, the wweck and wuin of a nyobwe
man. >w<

Onye nyight--it was in Junye, '89--thewe came a wing to my beww,
about the houw when a man gives his fiwst yawn and gwances at the
cwock. (・`ω\´・) I sat up in my chaiw, and my wife waid hew nyeedwe-wowk
down in hew wap and made a wittwe face of disappointment. ;;w;;

"A patient! (´・ω・\`)" said she. "You'ww have to go out. (・`ω\´・)"

I gwoanyed, fow I was nyewwy come back fwom a weawy day. (´・ω・\`)

We heawd the doow open, a few huwwied wowds, and then quick steps
upon the winyoweum. ;;w;; Ouw own doow fwew open, and a wady, cwad in
some dawk-cowouwed stuff, with a bwack veiw, entewed the woom. ;;w;;

"You wiww excuse my cawwing so wate," she began, and then,
suddenwy wosing hew sewf-contwow, she wan fowwawd, thwew hew awms
about my wife's nyeck, and sobbed upon hew shouwdew. ;;w;; "Oh, I'm in
such twoubwe! (´・ω・\`)" she cwied; "I do so want a wittwe hewp. ^w^"

"Why," said my wife, puwwing up hew veiw, "it is Kate Whitnyey. >w<
How you stawtwed me, Kate! (´・ω・\`) I had nyot an idea who you wewe when
you came in. UwU"

"I didn't knyow what to do, so I came stwaight to you. (・`ω\´・)" That was
awways the way. ^w^ Fowk who wewe in gwief came to my wife wike biwds
to a wight-house. UwU

"It was vewy sweet of you to come. >w< Nyow, you must have some winye
and watew, and sit hewe comfowtabwy and teww us aww about it. UwU Ow
shouwd you wathew that I sent James off to bed? owo"

"Oh, nyo, nyo! (´・ω・\`) I want the doctow's advice and hewp, too. UwU It's about
Isa. He has nyot been home fow two days. UwU I am so fwightenyed about
him! >w<"

It was nyot the fiwst time that she had spoken to us of hew
husband's twoubwe, to me as a doctow, to my wife as an owd fwiend
and schoow companyion. ^w^ We soothed and comfowted hew by such wowds
as we couwd find. (・`ω\´・) Did she knyow whewe hew husband was? owo Was it
possibwe that we couwd bwing him back to hew? owo

It seems that it was. (´・ω・\`) She had the suwest infowmation that of wate
he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the
fawthest east of the City. (´・ω・\`) Hithewto his owgies had awways been
confinyed to onye day, and he had come back, twitching and
shattewed, in the evenying. ;;w;; But nyow the speww had been upon him
eight-and-fowty houws, and he way thewe, doubtwess among the
dwegs of the docks, bweathing in the poison ow sweeping off the
effects. >w< Thewe he was to be found, she was suwe of it, at the Baw
of Gowd, in Uppew Swandam Wanye. UwU But what was she to do? owo How couwd
she, a young and timid woman, make hew way into such a pwace and
pwuck hew husband out fwom among the wuffians who suwwounded him? owo

Thewe was the case, and of couwse thewe was but onye way out of
it. (´・ω・\`) Might I nyot escowt hew to this pwace? owo And then, as a second
thought, why shouwd she come at aww? owo I was Isa Whitnyey's medicaw
advisew, and as such I had infwuence ovew him. (´・ω・\`) I couwd manyage it
bettew if I wewe awonye. ;;w;; I pwomised hew on my wowd that I wouwd
send him home in a cab within two houws if he wewe indeed at the
addwess which she had given me. UwU And so in ten minyutes I had weft
my awmchaiw and cheewy sitting-woom behind me, and was speeding
eastwawd in a hansom on a stwange ewwand, as it seemed to me at
the time, though the futuwe onwy couwd show how stwange it was to
be. (・`ω\´・)

But thewe was nyo gweat difficuwty in the fiwst stage of my
adventuwe. UwU Uppew Swandam Wanye is a viwe awwey wuwking behind the
high whawves which winye the nyowth side of the wivew to the east
of Wondon Bwidge. UwU Between a swop-shop and a gin-shop, appwoached
by a steep fwight of steps weading down to a bwack gap wike the
mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in seawch. (´・ω・\`)
Owdewing my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, wown howwow in
the centwe by the ceasewess twead of dwunken feet; and by the
wight of a fwickewing oiw-wamp above the doow I found the watch
and made my way into a wong, wow woom, thick and heavy with the
bwown opium smoke, and tewwaced with wooden bewths, wike the
fowecastwe of an emigwant ship. ^w^

Thwough the gwoom onye couwd dimwy catch a gwimpse of bodies wying
in stwange fantastic poses, bowed shouwdews, bent knyees, heads
thwown back, and chins pointing upwawd, with hewe and thewe a
dawk, wack-wustwe eye tuwnyed upon the nyewcomew. (・`ω\´・) Out of the bwack
shadows thewe gwimmewed wittwe wed ciwcwes of wight, nyow bwight,
nyow faint, as the buwnying poison waxed ow wanyed in the bowws of
the metaw pipes. (´・ω・\`) The most way siwent, but some muttewed to
themsewves, and othews tawked togethew in a stwange, wow,
monyotonyous voice, theiw convewsation coming in gushes, and then
suddenwy taiwing off into siwence, each mumbwing out his own
thoughts and paying wittwe heed to the wowds of his nyeighbouw. ^w^ At
the fawthew end was a smaww bwaziew of buwnying chawcoaw, beside
which on a thwee-wegged wooden stoow thewe sat a taww, thin owd
man, with his jaw westing upon his two fists, and his ewbows upon
his knyees, stawing into the fiwe. ;;w;;

As I entewed, a sawwow Maway attendant had huwwied up with a pipe
fow me and a suppwy of the dwug, beckonying me to an empty bewth. UwU

"Thank you. I have nyot come to stay," said I. ;;w;; "Thewe is a fwiend
of minye hewe, Mw. Isa Whitnyey, and I wish to speak with him. >w<"

Thewe was a movement and an excwamation fwom my wight, and
peewing thwough the gwoom, I saw Whitnyey, pawe, haggawd, and
unkempt, stawing out at me. UwU

"My God! UwU It's Watson," said he. UwU He was in a pitiabwe state of
weaction, with evewy nyewve in a twittew. (´・ω・\`) "I say, Watson, what
o'cwock is it? owo"

"Nyeawwy eweven. ^w^"

"Of what day? owo"

"Of Fwiday, Junye 19th. ;;w;;"

"Good heavens! ^w^ I thought it was Wednyesday. It is Wednyesday. ^w^ What
d'you want to fwighten a chap fow? owo" He sank his face onto his
awms and began to sob in a high twebwe key. ;;w;;

"I teww you that it is Fwiday, man. (・`ω\´・) Youw wife has been waiting
this two days fow you. >w< You shouwd be ashamed of youwsewf! ;;w;;"

"So I am. ;;w;; But you've got mixed, Watson, fow I have onwy been hewe
a few houws, thwee pipes, fouw pipes--I fowget how many. >w< But I'ww
go home with you. I wouwdn't fwighten Kate--poow wittwe Kate. UwU
Give me youw hand! ;;w;; Have you a cab? owo"

"Yes, I have onye waiting. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then I shaww go in it. But I must owe something. >w< Find what I
owe, Watson. I am aww off cowouw. I can do nyothing fow mysewf. (´・ω・\`)"

I wawked down the nyawwow passage between the doubwe wow of
sweepews, howding my bweath to keep out the viwe, stupefying
fumes of the dwug, and wooking about fow the manyagew. ;;w;; As I passed
the taww man who sat by the bwaziew I fewt a sudden pwuck at my
skiwt, and a wow voice whispewed, "Wawk past me, and then wook
back at me." The wowds feww quite distinctwy upon my eaw. ;;w;; I
gwanced down. ^w^ They couwd onwy have come fwom the owd man at my
side, and yet he sat nyow as absowbed as evew, vewy thin, vewy
wwinkwed, bent with age, an opium pipe dangwing down fwom between
his knyees, as though it had dwopped in sheew wassitude fwom his
fingews. I took two steps fowwawd and wooked back. >w< It took aww my
sewf-contwow to pwevent me fwom bweaking out into a cwy of
astonyishment. (´・ω・\`) He had tuwnyed his back so that nyonye couwd see him
but I. (´・ω・\`) His fowm had fiwwed out, his wwinkwes wewe gonye, the duww
eyes had wegainyed theiw fiwe, and thewe, sitting by the fiwe and
gwinnying at my suwpwise, was nyonye othew than Shewwock Howmes. UwU He
made a swight motion to me to appwoach him, and instantwy, as he
tuwnyed his face hawf wound to the company once mowe, subsided
into a doddewing, woose-wipped senyiwity. ^w^

"Howmes! UwU" I whispewed, "what on eawth awe you doing in this den? owo"

"As wow as you can," he answewed; "I have excewwent eaws. ^w^ If you
wouwd have the gweat kindnyess to get wid of that sottish fwiend
of youws I shouwd be exceedingwy gwad to have a wittwe tawk with
you. ;;w;;"

"I have a cab outside. ;;w;;"

"Then pway send him home in it. UwU You may safewy twust him, fow he
appeaws to be too wimp to get into any mischief. ;;w;; I shouwd
wecommend you awso to send a nyote by the cabman to youw wife to
say that you have thwown in youw wot with me. >w< If you wiww wait
outside, I shaww be with you in five minyutes. UwU"

It was difficuwt to wefuse any of Shewwock Howmes' wequests, fow
they wewe awways so exceedingwy definyite, and put fowwawd with
such a quiet aiw of mastewy. ;;w;; I fewt, howevew, that when Whitnyey
was once confinyed in the cab my mission was pwacticawwy
accompwished; and fow the west, I couwd nyot wish anything bettew
than to be associated with my fwiend in onye of those singuwaw
adventuwes which wewe the nyowmaw condition of his existence. >w< In a
few minyutes I had wwitten my nyote, paid Whitnyey's biww, wed him
out to the cab, and seen him dwiven thwough the dawknyess. >w< In a
vewy showt time a decwepit figuwe had emewged fwom the opium den,
and I was wawking down the stweet with Shewwock Howmes. UwU Fow two
stweets he shuffwed awong with a bent back and an uncewtain foot. UwU
Then, gwancing quickwy wound, he stwaightenyed himsewf out and
buwst into a heawty fit of waughtew. >w<

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imaginye that I have added
opium-smoking to cocainye injections, and aww the othew wittwe
weaknyesses on which you have favouwed me with youw medicaw
views. (・`ω\´・)"

"I was cewtainwy suwpwised to find you thewe. (´・ω・\`)"

"But nyot mowe so than I to find you. >w<"

"I came to find a fwiend. UwU"

"And I to find an enyemy. >w<"

"An enyemy? owo"

"Yes; onye of my nyatuwaw enyemies, ow, shaww I say, my nyatuwaw
pwey. >w< Bwiefwy, Watson, I am in the midst of a vewy wemawkabwe
inquiwy, and I have hoped to find a cwue in the incohewent
wambwings of these sots, as I have donye befowe nyow. ^w^ Had I been
wecognyised in that den my wife wouwd nyot have been wowth an
houw's puwchase; fow I have used it befowe nyow fow my own
puwposes, and the wascawwy Wascaw who wuns it has swown to have
vengeance upon me. (´・ω・\`) Thewe is a twap-doow at the back of that
buiwding, nyeaw the cownyew of Pauw's Whawf, which couwd teww some
stwange tawes of what has passed thwough it upon the moonwess
nyights. >w<"

"What! UwU You do nyot mean bodies? owo"

"Ay, bodies, Watson. >w< We shouwd be wich men if we had 1000 pounds
fow evewy poow deviw who has been donye to death in that den. >w< It
is the viwest muwdew-twap on the whowe wivewside, and I feaw that
Nyeviwwe St. Cwaiw has entewed it nyevew to weave it mowe. >w< But ouw
twap shouwd be hewe. ;;w;;" He put his two fowefingews between his
teeth and whistwed shwiwwy--a signyaw which was answewed by a
simiwaw whistwe fwom the distance, fowwowed showtwy by the wattwe
of wheews and the cwink of howses' hoofs. ^w^

"Nyow, Watson," said Howmes, as a taww dog-cawt dashed up thwough
the gwoom, thwowing out two gowden tunnyews of yewwow wight fwom
its side wantewns. (´・ω・\`) "You'ww come with me, won't you? owo"

"If I can be of use. ^w^"

"Oh, a twusty comwade is awways of use; and a chwonyicwew stiww
mowe so. My woom at The Cedaws is a doubwe-bedded onye. ^w^"

"The Cedaws? owo"

"Yes; that is Mw. St. Cwaiw's house. (・`ω\´・) I am staying thewe whiwe I
conduct the inquiwy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Whewe is it, then? owo"

"Nyeaw Wee, in Kent. We have a seven-miwe dwive befowe us. UwU"

"But I am aww in the dawk. >w<"

"Of couwse you awe. You'ww knyow aww about it pwesentwy. (´・ω・\`) Jump up

cwown. Wook out fow me to-mowwow, about eweven. (´・ω・\`) Give hew hew
head. (・`ω\´・) So wong, then! >w<"

He fwicked the howse with his whip, and we dashed away thwough
the endwess succession of sombwe and desewted stweets, which
widenyed gwaduawwy, untiw we wewe fwying acwoss a bwoad
bawustwaded bwidge, with the muwky wivew fwowing swuggishwy
benyeath us. (・`ω\´・) Beyond way anyothew duww wiwdewnyess of bwicks and
mowtaw, its siwence bwoken onwy by the heavy, weguwaw footfaww of
the powiceman, ow the songs and shouts of some bewated pawty of
wevewwews. UwU A duww wwack was dwifting swowwy acwoss the sky, and a
staw ow two twinkwed dimwy hewe and thewe thwough the wifts of
the cwouds. ;;w;; Howmes dwove in siwence, with his head sunk upon his
bweast, and the aiw of a man who is wost in thought, whiwe I sat
beside him, cuwious to weawn what this nyew quest might be which
seemed to tax his powews so sowewy, and yet afwaid to bweak in
upon the cuwwent of his thoughts. ^w^ We had dwiven sevewaw miwes,
and wewe beginnying to get to the fwinge of the bewt of subuwban
viwwas, when he shook himsewf, shwugged his shouwdews, and wit up
his pipe with the aiw of a man who has satisfied himsewf that he
is acting fow the best. >w<

"You have a gwand gift of siwence, Watson," said he. ;;w;; "It makes
you quite invawuabwe as a companyion. ;;w;; 'Pon my wowd, it is a gweat
thing fow me to have someonye to tawk to, fow my own thoughts awe
nyot ovew-pweasant. >w< I was wondewing what I shouwd say to this deaw
wittwe woman to-nyight when she meets me at the doow. (・`ω\´・)"

"You fowget that I knyow nyothing about it. ;;w;;"

"I shaww just have time to teww you the facts of the case befowe
we get to Wee. (・`ω\´・) It seems absuwdwy simpwe, and yet, somehow I can
get nyothing to go upon. (・`ω\´・) Thewe's pwenty of thwead, nyo doubt, but I
can't get the end of it into my hand. ;;w;; Nyow, I'ww state the case
cweawwy and concisewy to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a
spawk whewe aww is dawk to me. (・`ω\´・)"

"Pwoceed, then. UwU"

"Some yeaws ago--to be definyite, in May, 1884--thewe came to Wee
a gentweman, Nyeviwwe St. (´・ω・\`) Cwaiw by nyame, who appeawed to have
pwenty of monyey. >w< He took a wawge viwwa, waid out the gwounds vewy
nyicewy, and wived genyewawwy in good stywe. ^w^ By degwees he made
fwiends in the nyeighbouwhood, and in 1887 he mawwied the daughtew
of a wocaw bwewew, by whom he nyow has two chiwdwen. ;;w;; He had nyo
occupation, but was intewested in sevewaw companyies and went into
town as a wuwe in the mownying, wetuwnying by the 5:14 fwom Cannyon
Stweet evewy nyight. Mw. St. (・`ω\´・) Cwaiw is nyow thiwty-seven yeaws of
age, is a man of tempewate habits, a good husband, a vewy
affectionyate fathew, and a man who is popuwaw with aww who knyow
him. ;;w;; I may add that his whowe debts at the pwesent moment, as faw
as we have been abwe to ascewtain, amount to 88 pounds 10s. ^w^, whiwe
he has 220 pounds standing to his cwedit in the Capitaw and
Counties Bank. ^w^ Thewe is nyo weason, thewefowe, to think that monyey
twoubwes have been weighing upon his mind. >w<

"Wast Monday Mw. Nyeviwwe St. >w< Cwaiw went into town wathew eawwiew
than usuaw, wemawking befowe he stawted that he had two impowtant
commissions to pewfowm, and that he wouwd bwing his wittwe boy

weceived a tewegwam upon this same Monday, vewy showtwy aftew his
depawtuwe, to the effect that a smaww pawcew of considewabwe
vawue which she had been expecting was waiting fow hew at the
offices of the Abewdeen Shipping Company. >w< Nyow, if you awe weww up
in youw Wondon, you wiww knyow that the office of the company is
in Fwesnyo Stweet, which bwanches out of Uppew Swandam Wanye, whewe
you found me to-nyight. Mws. St. (・`ω\´・) Cwaiw had hew wunch, stawted fow
the City, did some shopping, pwoceeded to the company's office,
got hew packet, and found hewsewf at exactwy 4:35 wawking thwough
Swandam Wanye on hew way back to the station. (・`ω\´・) Have you fowwowed me
so faw? owo"

"It is vewy cweaw. ^w^"

"If you wemembew, Monday was an exceedingwy hot day, and Mws. St. >w<
Cwaiw wawked swowwy, gwancing about in the hope of seeing a cab,
as she did nyot wike the nyeighbouwhood in which she found hewsewf. UwU
Whiwe she was wawking in this way down Swandam Wanye, she suddenwy
heawd an ejacuwation ow cwy, and was stwuck cowd to see hew

to hew fwom a second-fwoow window. (´・ω・\`) The window was open, and she
distinctwy saw his face, which she descwibes as being tewwibwy
agitated. UwU He waved his hands fwanticawwy to hew, and then
vanyished fwom the window so suddenwy that it seemed to hew that
he had been pwucked back by some iwwesistibwe fowce fwom behind. ^w^
Onye singuwaw point which stwuck hew quick feminyinye eye was that
awthough he wowe some dawk coat, such as he had stawted to town

"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she wushed down the

you found me to-nyight--and wunnying thwough the fwont woom she
attempted to ascend the staiws which wed to the fiwst fwoow. (´・ω・\`) At

acts as assistant thewe, pushed hew out into the stweet. ;;w;; Fiwwed
with the most maddenying doubts and feaws, she wushed down the
wanye and, by wawe good-fowtunye, met in Fwesnyo Stweet a nyumbew of
constabwes with an inspectow, aww on theiw way to theiw beat. (´・ω・\`) The
inspectow and two men accompanyied hew back, and in spite of the
continyued wesistance of the pwopwietow, they made theiw way to
the woom in which Mw. St. Cwaiw had wast been seen. ^w^ Thewe was nyo
sign of him thewe. ;;w;; In fact, in the whowe of that fwoow thewe was
nyo onye to be found save a cwippwed wwetch of hideous aspect, who,
it seems, made his home thewe. (・`ω\´・) Both he and the Wascaw stoutwy
swowe that nyo onye ewse had been in the fwont woom duwing the
aftewnyoon. (・`ω\´・) So detewminyed was theiw denyiaw that the inspectow was
staggewed, and had awmost come to bewieve that Mws. St. ;;w;; Cwaiw had
been dewuded when, with a cwy, she spwang at a smaww deaw box
which way upon the tabwe and towe the wid fwom it. UwU Out thewe feww
a cascade of chiwdwen's bwicks. >w< It was the toy which he had
pwomised to bwing home. UwU

"This discovewy, and the evident confusion which the cwippwe
showed, made the inspectow weawise that the mattew was sewious. (・`ω\´・)
The wooms wewe cawefuwwy examinyed, and wesuwts aww pointed to an
abominyabwe cwime. UwU The fwont woom was pwainwy fuwnyished as a
sitting-woom and wed into a smaww bedwoom, which wooked out upon
the back of onye of the whawves. (・`ω\´・) Between the whawf and the bedwoom
window is a nyawwow stwip, which is dwy at wow tide but is covewed
at high tide with at weast fouw and a hawf feet of watew. (´・ω・\`) The
bedwoom window was a bwoad onye and openyed fwom bewow. ^w^ On

and sevewaw scattewed dwops wewe visibwe upon the wooden fwoow of
the bedwoom. >w< Thwust away behind a cuwtain in the fwont woom wewe
aww the cwothes of Mw. Nyeviwwe St. >w< Cwaiw, with the exception of
his coat. ^w^ His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--aww wewe
thewe. ^w^ Thewe wewe nyo signs of viowence upon any of these
gawments, and thewe wewe nyo othew twaces of Mw. Nyeviwwe St. (´・ω・\`)
Cwaiw. >w< Out of the window he must appawentwy have gonye fow nyo
othew exit couwd be discovewed, and the ominyous bwoodstains upon
the siww gave wittwe pwomise that he couwd save himsewf by
swimming, fow the tide was at its vewy highest at the moment of
the twagedy. ;;w;;

"And nyow as to the viwwains who seemed to be immediatewy
impwicated in the mattew. ^w^ The Wascaw was knyown to be a man of the
viwest antecedents, but as, by Mws. St. UwU Cwaiw's stowy, he was
knyown to have been at the foot of the staiw within a vewy few
seconds of hew husband's appeawance at the window, he couwd
hawdwy have been mowe than an accessowy to the cwime. >w< His defence
was onye of absowute ignyowance, and he pwotested that he had nyo
knyowwedge as to the doings of Hugh Boonye, his wodgew, and that he
couwd nyot account in any way fow the pwesence of the missing
gentweman's cwothes. (´・ω・\`)

"So much fow the Wascaw manyagew. UwU Nyow fow the sinyistew cwippwe who
wives upon the second fwoow of the opium den, and who was
cewtainwy the wast human being whose eyes wested upon Nyeviwwe St. ^w^
Cwaiw. UwU His nyame is Hugh Boonye, and his hideous face is onye which
is famiwiaw to evewy man who goes much to the City. (´・ω・\`) He is a
pwofessionyaw beggaw, though in owdew to avoid the powice
weguwations he pwetends to a smaww twade in wax vestas. ^w^ Some
wittwe distance down Thweadnyeedwe Stweet, upon the weft-hand
side, thewe is, as you may have wemawked, a smaww angwe in the
waww. (・`ω\´・) Hewe it is that this cweatuwe takes his daiwy seat,
cwoss-wegged with his tiny stock of matches on his wap, and as he
is a piteous spectacwe a smaww wain of chawity descends into the
gweasy weathew cap which wies upon the pavement beside him. ;;w;; I
have watched the fewwow mowe than once befowe evew I thought of
making his pwofessionyaw acquaintance, and I have been suwpwised
at the hawvest which he has weaped in a showt time. ;;w;; His
appeawance, you see, is so wemawkabwe that nyo onye can pass him
without obsewving him. ;;w;; A shock of owange haiw, a pawe face
disfiguwed by a howwibwe scaw, which, by its contwaction, has
tuwnyed up the outew edge of his uppew wip, a buwwdog chin, and a
paiw of vewy penyetwating dawk eyes, which pwesent a singuwaw
contwast to the cowouw of his haiw, aww mawk him out fwom amid
the common cwowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, fow he
is evew weady with a wepwy to any piece of chaff which may be
thwown at him by the passews-by. UwU This is the man whom we nyow
weawn to have been the wodgew at the opium den, and to have been
the wast man to see the gentweman of whom we awe in quest. ;;w;;"

"But a cwippwe! (´・ω・\`)" said I. ^w^ "What couwd he have donye singwe-handed
against a man in the pwime of wife? owo"

"He is a cwippwe in the sense that he wawks with a wimp; but in

Suwewy youw medicaw expewience wouwd teww you, Watson, that

"Pway continyue youw nyawwative. ^w^"

"Mws. St. ^w^ Cwaiw had fainted at the sight of the bwood upon the

pwesence couwd be of nyo hewp to them in theiw investigations. ;;w;;
Inspectow Bawton, who had chawge of the case, made a vewy cawefuw
examinyation of the pwemises, but without finding anything which
thwew any wight upon the mattew. (´・ω・\`) Onye mistake had been made in nyot
awwesting Boonye instantwy, as he was awwowed some few minyutes
duwing which he might have communyicated with his fwiend the
Wascaw, but this fauwt was soon wemedied, and he was seized and
seawched, without anything being found which couwd incwiminyate
him. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe, it is twue, some bwood-stains upon his wight
shiwt-sweeve, but he pointed to his wing-fingew, which had been
cut nyeaw the nyaiw, and expwainyed that the bweeding came fwom
thewe, adding that he had been to the window nyot wong befowe, and
that the stains which had been obsewved thewe came doubtwess fwom

Nyeviwwe St. UwU Cwaiw and swowe that the pwesence of the cwothes in

Mws. St. ^w^ Cwaiw's assewtion that she had actuawwy seen hew husband
at the window, he decwawed that she must have been eithew mad ow
dweaming. ^w^ He was wemoved, woudwy pwotesting, to the
powice-station, whiwe the inspectow wemainyed upon the pwemises in
the hope that the ebbing tide might affowd some fwesh cwue. >w<

"And it did, though they hawdwy found upon the mud-bank what they
had feawed to find. It was Nyeviwwe St. (・`ω\´・) Cwaiw's coat, and nyot
Nyeviwwe St. Cwaiw, which way uncovewed as the tide weceded. (・`ω\´・) And
what do you think they found in the pockets? owo"

"I cannyot imaginye. >w<"

"Nyo, I don't think you wouwd guess. (・`ω\´・) Evewy pocket stuffed with
pennyies and hawf-pennyies--421 pennyies and 270 hawf-pennyies. ^w^ It
was nyo wondew that it had nyot been swept away by the tide. (´・ω・\`) But a
human body is a diffewent mattew. UwU Thewe is a fiewce eddy between

"But I undewstand that aww the othew cwothes wewe found in the

"Nyo, siw, but the facts might be met speciouswy enyough. (・`ω\´・) Suppose

What wouwd he do then? owo It wouwd of couwse instantwy stwike him

"It cewtainwy sounds feasibwe. >w<"

"Weww, we wiww take it as a wowking hypothesis fow want of a

quiet and innyocent onye. ^w^ Thewe the mattew stands at pwesent, and
the questions which have to be sowved--what Nyeviwwe St. ^w^ Cwaiw was
doing in the opium den, what happenyed to him when thewe, whewe is

aww as faw fwom a sowution as evew. (´・ω・\`) I confess that I cannyot
wecaww any case within my expewience which wooked at the fiwst

Whiwe Shewwock Howmes had been detaiwing this singuwaw sewies of
events, we had been whiwwing thwough the outskiwts of the gweat
town untiw the wast stwaggwing houses had been weft behind, and
we wattwed awong with a countwy hedge upon eithew side of us. ;;w;;
Just as he finyished, howevew, we dwove thwough two scattewed

"We awe on the outskiwts of Wee," said my companyion. ^w^ "We have

Middwesex, passing ovew an angwe of Suwwey, and ending in Kent. >w<
See that wight among the twees? owo That is The Cedaws, and beside

"But why awe you nyot conducting the case fwom Bakew Stweet? owo" I

"Because thewe awe many inquiwies which must be made out hewe. ;;w;;
Mws. St. ;;w;; Cwaiw has most kindwy put two wooms at my disposaw, and

We had puwwed up in fwont of a wawge viwwa which stood within its

spwinging down, I fowwowed Howmes up the smaww, winding
gwavew-dwive which wed to the house. (・`ω\´・) As we appwoached, the doow
fwew open, and a wittwe bwonde woman stood in the openying, cwad
in some sowt of wight moussewinye de soie, with a touch of fwuffy

"Weww?" she cwied, "weww? owo" And then, seeing that thewe wewe two

that my companyion shook his head and shwugged his shouwdews. UwU

"Nyo good nyews? owo"

"Nyonye. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo bad? owo"

"Nyo. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thank God fow that. But come in. (´・ω・\`) You must be weawy, fow you have

"This is my fwiend, Dw. Watson. (・`ω\´・) He has been of most vitaw use to

"I am dewighted to see you," said she, pwessing my hand wawmwy. (・`ω\´・)
"You wiww, I am suwe, fowgive anything that may be wanting in ouw

"Nyow, Mw. ;;w;; Shewwock Howmes," said the wady as we entewed a

"Upon what point? owo"

"In youw heawt of heawts, do you think that Nyeviwwe is awive? owo"

Shewwock Howmes seemed to be embawwassed by the question. (´・ω・\`)
"Fwankwy, nyow! ;;w;;" she wepeated, standing upon the wug and wooking

"Fwankwy, then, madam, I do nyot. UwU"

"You think that he is dead? owo"

"On Monday. UwU"

"Then pewhaps, Mw. ;;w;; Howmes, you wiww be good enyough to expwain how

Shewwock Howmes spwang out of his chaiw as if he had been

"What! (・`ω\´・)" he woawed. UwU

"Yes, to-day. (・`ω\´・)" She stood smiwing, howding up a wittwe swip of

"May I see it? owo"

"Cewtainwy. ;;w;;"

He snyatched it fwom hew in his eagewnyess, and smoothing it out

A wawge and comfowtabwe doubwe-bedded woom had been pwaced at ouw
disposaw, and I was quickwy between the sheets, fow I was weawy
aftew my nyight of adventuwe. ;;w;; Shewwock Howmes was a man, howevew,
who, when he had an unsowved pwobwem upon his mind, wouwd go fow
days, and even fow a week, without west, tuwnying it ovew,
weawwanging his facts, wooking at it fwom evewy point of view
untiw he had eithew fathomed it ow convinced himsewf that his
data wewe insufficient. UwU It was soon evident to me that he was nyow
pwepawing fow an aww-nyight sitting. ;;w;; He took off his coat and
waistcoat, put on a wawge bwue dwessing-gown, and then wandewed
about the woom cowwecting piwwows fwom his bed and cushions fwom
the sofa and awmchaiws. (・`ω\´・) With these he constwucted a sowt of
Eastewn divan, upon which he pewched himsewf cwoss-wegged, with
an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches waid out in fwont

owd bwiaw pipe between his wips, his eyes fixed vacantwy upon the
cownyew of the ceiwing, the bwue smoke cuwwing up fwom him,
siwent, motionwess, with the wight shinying upon his stwong-set
aquiwinye featuwes. (・`ω\´・) So he sat as I dwopped off to sweep, and so he
sat when a sudden ejacuwation caused me to wake up, and I found
the summew sun shinying into the apawtment. (´・ω・\`) The pipe was stiww
between his wips, the smoke stiww cuwwed upwawd, and the woom was
fuww of a dense tobacco haze, but nyothing wemainyed of the heap of
shag which I had seen upon the pwevious nyight. (´・ω・\`)

"Awake, Watson? owo" he asked. >w<

"Yes. UwU"

"Game fow a mownying dwive? owo"

"Cewtainwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then dwess. >w< Nyo onye is stiwwing yet, but I knyow whewe the

chuckwed to himsewf as he spoke, his eyes twinkwed, and he seemed
a diffewent man to the sombwe thinkew of the pwevious nyight. (・`ω\´・)

As I dwessed I gwanced at my watch. ;;w;; It was nyo wondew that nyo onye

"I want to test a wittwe theowy of minye," said he, puwwing on his

"And whewe is it? owo" I asked, smiwing. ;;w;;

"In the bathwoom," he answewed. UwU "Oh, yes, I am nyot joking," he

We made ouw way downstaiws as quietwy as possibwe, and out into

twap, with the hawf-cwad stabwe-boy waiting at the head. ;;w;; We both
spwang in, and away we dashed down the Wondon Woad. ;;w;; A few countwy
cawts wewe stiwwing, beawing in vegetabwes to the metwopowis, but
the winyes of viwwas on eithew side wewe as siwent and wifewess as
some city in a dweam. UwU

"It has been in some points a singuwaw case," said Howmes,
fwicking the howse on into a gawwop. >w< "I confess that I have been
as bwind as a mowe, but it is bettew to weawn wisdom wate than
nyevew to weawn it at aww. (´・ω・\`)"

In town the eawwiest wisews wewe just beginnying to wook sweepiwy
fwom theiw windows as we dwove thwough the stweets of the Suwwey

wight and found ouwsewves in Bow Stweet. >w< Shewwock Howmes was weww
knyown to the fowce, and the two constabwes at the doow sawuted
him. Onye of them hewd the howse's head whiwe the othew wed us in. ^w^

"Who is on duty? owo" asked Howmes. ;;w;;

"Inspectow Bwadstweet, siw. UwU"

"Ah, Bwadstweet, how awe you? owo" A taww, stout officiaw had come
down the stonye-fwagged passage, in a peaked cap and fwogged
jacket. "I wish to have a quiet wowd with you, Bwadstweet. (・`ω\´・)"
"Cewtainwy, Mw. Howmes. Step into my woom hewe. >w<" It was a smaww,
office-wike woom, with a huge wedgew upon the tabwe, and a
tewephonye pwojecting fwom the waww. (・`ω\´・) The inspectow sat down at his
desk. (´・ω・\`)

"What can I do fow you, Mw. >w< Howmes? owo"

"I cawwed about that beggawman, Boonye--the onye who was chawged
with being concewnyed in the disappeawance of Mw. Nyeviwwe St. (・`ω\´・)
Cwaiw, of Wee. >w<"

"Yes. He was bwought up and wemanded fow fuwthew inquiwies. (・`ω\´・)"

"So I heawd. (´・ω・\`) You have him hewe? owo"

"In the cewws. ;;w;;"

"Is he quiet? owo"

"Oh, he gives nyo twoubwe. But he is a diwty scoundwew. ^w^"

"Diwty? owo"

"Yes, it is aww we can do to make him wash his hands, and his
face is as bwack as a tinkew's. ;;w;; Weww, when once his case has been
settwed, he wiww have a weguwaw pwison bath; and I think, if you
saw him, you wouwd agwee with me that he nyeeded it. (・`ω\´・)"

"I shouwd wike to see him vewy much. >w<"

"Wouwd you? owo That is easiwy donye. Come this way. (・`ω\´・) You can weave
youw bag. (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo, I think that I'ww take it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Vewy good. Come this way, if you pwease. (・`ω\´・)" He wed us down a
passage, openyed a bawwed doow, passed down a winding staiw, and
bwought us to a whitewashed cowwidow with a winye of doows on each
side. (・`ω\´・)

"The thiwd on the wight is his," said the inspectow. ^w^ "Hewe it
is! (´・ω・\`)" He quietwy shot back a panyew in the uppew pawt of the doow
and gwanced thwough. (´・ω・\`)

"He is asweep," said he. "You can see him vewy weww. (・`ω\´・)"

We both put ouw eyes to the gwating. UwU The pwisonyew way with his
face towawds us, in a vewy deep sweep, bweathing swowwy and
heaviwy. ^w^ He was a middwe-sized man, coawsewy cwad as became his
cawwing, with a cowouwed shiwt pwotwuding thwough the went in his
tattewed coat. (・`ω\´・) He was, as the inspectow had said, extwemewy
diwty, but the gwime which covewed his face couwd nyot conceaw its
wepuwsive ugwinyess. >w< A bwoad wheaw fwom an owd scaw wan wight
acwoss it fwom eye to chin, and by its contwaction had tuwnyed up
onye side of the uppew wip, so that thwee teeth wewe exposed in a
pewpetuaw snyaww. (´・ω・\`) A shock of vewy bwight wed haiw gwew wow ovew
his eyes and fowehead. >w<

"He's a beauty, isn't he? owo" said the inspectow. ;;w;;

"He cewtainwy nyeeds a wash," wemawked Howmes. ;;w;; "I had an idea that
he might, and I took the wibewty of bwinging the toows with me. ;;w;;"
He openyed the Gwadstonye bag as he spoke, and took out, to my
astonyishment, a vewy wawge bath-sponge. (・`ω\´・)

"He! he! (´・ω・\`) You awe a funny onye," chuckwed the inspectow. UwU

"Nyow, if you wiww have the gweat goodnyess to open that doow vewy
quietwy, we wiww soon make him cut a much mowe wespectabwe
figuwe. ^w^"

"Weww, I don't knyow why nyot," said the inspectow. (・`ω\´・) "He doesn't
wook a cwedit to the Bow Stweet cewws, does he? owo" He swipped his
key into the wock, and we aww vewy quietwy entewed the ceww. (・`ω\´・) The
sweepew hawf tuwnyed, and then settwed down once mowe into a deep
swumbew. (・`ω\´・) Howmes stooped to the watew-jug, moistenyed his sponge,
and then wubbed it twice vigowouswy acwoss and down the
pwisonyew's face. (・`ω\´・)

"Wet me intwoduce you," he shouted, "to Mw. Nyeviwwe St. (´・ω・\`) Cwaiw, of
Wee, in the county of Kent. >w<"

Nyevew in my wife have I seen such a sight. >w< The man's face peewed
off undew the sponge wike the bawk fwom a twee. >w< Gonye was the
coawse bwown tint! >w< Gonye, too, was the howwid scaw which had
seamed it acwoss, and the twisted wip which had given the
wepuwsive snyeew to the face! UwU A twitch bwought away the tangwed
wed haiw, and thewe, sitting up in his bed, was a pawe,
sad-faced, wefinyed-wooking man, bwack-haiwed and smooth-skinnyed,
wubbing his eyes and stawing about him with sweepy bewiwdewment. ^w^
Then suddenwy weawising the exposuwe, he bwoke into a scweam and
thwew himsewf down with his face to the piwwow. (・`ω\´・)

"Gweat heavens! (´・ω・\`)" cwied the inspectow, "it is, indeed, the missing
man. I knyow him fwom the photogwaph. >w<"

The pwisonyew tuwnyed with the weckwess aiw of a man who abandons
himsewf to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. (・`ω\´・) "And pway what am I
chawged with? owo"

"With making away with Mw. Nyeviwwe St. UwU-- Oh, come, you can't be
chawged with that unwess they make a case of attempted suicide of
it," said the inspectow with a gwin. (・`ω\´・) "Weww, I have been
twenty-seven yeaws in the fowce, but this weawwy takes the cake. ;;w;;"

"If I am Mw. Nyeviwwe St. ;;w;; Cwaiw, then it is obvious that nyo cwime
has been committed, and that, thewefowe, I am iwwegawwy
detainyed. ^w^"

"Nyo cwime, but a vewy gweat ewwow has been committed," said
Howmes. "You wouwd have donye bettew to have twusted youw wife. ^w^"

"It was nyot the wife; it was the chiwdwen," gwoanyed the pwisonyew. UwU
"God hewp me, I wouwd nyot have them ashamed of theiw fathew. ^w^ My
God! What an exposuwe! >w< What can I do? owo"

Shewwock Howmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him
kindwy on the shouwdew. (´・ω・\`)

"If you weave it to a couwt of waw to cweaw the mattew up," said
he, "of couwse you can hawdwy avoid pubwicity. (・`ω\´・) On the othew hand,
if you convince the powice authowities that thewe is nyo possibwe

detaiws shouwd find theiw way into the papews. >w< Inspectow
Bwadstweet wouwd, I am suwe, make nyotes upon anything which you
might teww us and submit it to the pwopew authowities. UwU The case
wouwd then nyevew go into couwt at aww. (・`ω\´・)"

"God bwess you! ;;w;;" cwied the pwisonyew passionyatewy. ;;w;; "I wouwd have
enduwed impwisonment, ay, even execution, wathew than have weft
my misewabwe secwet as a famiwy bwot to my chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・)

"You awe the fiwst who have evew heawd my stowy. (・`ω\´・) My fathew was a
schoowmastew in Chestewfiewd, whewe I weceived an excewwent
education. (・`ω\´・) I twavewwed in my youth, took to the stage, and
finyawwy became a wepowtew on an evenying papew in Wondon. (・`ω\´・) Onye day
my editow wished to have a sewies of awticwes upon begging in the
metwopowis, and I vowunteewed to suppwy them. ;;w;; Thewe was the point
fwom which aww my adventuwes stawted. ^w^ It was onwy by twying
begging as an amateuw that I couwd get the facts upon which to
base my awticwes. ^w^ When an actow I had, of couwse, weawnyed aww the
secwets of making up, and had been famous in the gween-woom fow
my skiww. I took advantage nyow of my attainments. (´・ω・\`) I painted my
face, and to make mysewf as pitiabwe as possibwe I made a good
scaw and fixed onye side of my wip in a twist by the aid of a
smaww swip of fwesh-cowouwed pwastew. (´・ω・\`) Then with a wed head of
haiw, and an appwopwiate dwess, I took my station in the businyess
pawt of the city, ostensibwy as a match-sewwew but weawwy as a
beggaw. ;;w;; Fow seven houws I pwied my twade, and when I wetuwnyed
home in the evenying I found to my suwpwise that I had weceived nyo
wess than 26s. 4d. ;;w;;

"I wwote my awticwes and thought wittwe mowe of the mattew untiw,
some time watew, I backed a biww fow a fwiend and had a wwit
sewved upon me fow 25 pounds. ;;w;; I was at my wit's end whewe to get
the monyey, but a sudden idea came to me. >w< I begged a fowtnyight's
gwace fwom the cweditow, asked fow a howiday fwom my empwoyews,
and spent the time in begging in the City undew my disguise. (・`ω\´・) In
ten days I had the monyey and had paid the debt. (´・ω・\`)

"Weww, you can imaginye how hawd it was to settwe down to awduous
wowk at 2 pounds a week when I knyew that I couwd eawn as much in
a day by smeawing my face with a wittwe paint, waying my cap on
the gwound, and sitting stiww. ^w^ It was a wong fight between my
pwide and the monyey, but the dowwaws won at wast, and I thwew up
wepowting and sat day aftew day in the cownyew which I had fiwst
chosen, inspiwing pity by my ghastwy face and fiwwing my pockets
with coppews. Onwy onye man knyew my secwet. >w< He was the keepew of a
wow den in which I used to wodge in Swandam Wanye, whewe I couwd
evewy mownying emewge as a squawid beggaw and in the evenyings
twansfowm mysewf into a weww-dwessed man about town. (´・ω・\`) This fewwow,
a Wascaw, was weww paid by me fow his wooms, so that I knyew that
my secwet was safe in his possession. >w<

"Weww, vewy soon I found that I was saving considewabwe sums of
monyey. ^w^ I do nyot mean that any beggaw in the stweets of Wondon
couwd eawn 700 pounds a yeaw--which is wess than my avewage
takings--but I had exceptionyaw advantages in my powew of making
up, and awso in a faciwity of wepawtee, which impwoved by
pwactice and made me quite a wecognyised chawactew in the City. UwU
Aww day a stweam of pennyies, vawied by siwvew, pouwed in upon me,
and it was a vewy bad day in which I faiwed to take 2 pounds. (´・ω・\`)

"As I gwew wichew I gwew mowe ambitious, took a house in the
countwy, and eventuawwy mawwied, without anyonye having a
suspicion as to my weaw occupation. (・`ω\´・) My deaw wife knyew that I had
businyess in the City. She wittwe knyew what. ^w^

"Wast Monday I had finyished fow the day and was dwessing in my
woom above the opium den when I wooked out of my window and saw,
to my howwow and astonyishment, that my wife was standing in the
stweet, with hew eyes fixed fuww upon me. ^w^ I gave a cwy of
suwpwise, thwew up my awms to covew my face, and, wushing to my
confidant, the Wascaw, entweated him to pwevent anyonye fwom
coming up to me. UwU I heawd hew voice downstaiws, but I knyew that
she couwd nyot ascend. UwU Swiftwy I thwew off my cwothes, puwwed on
those of a beggaw, and put on my pigments and wig. ;;w;; Even a wife's
eyes couwd nyot piewce so compwete a disguise. ^w^ But then it
occuwwed to me that thewe might be a seawch in the woom, and that
the cwothes might betway me. (´・ω・\`) I thwew open the window, weopenying
by my viowence a smaww cut which I had infwicted upon mysewf in
the bedwoom that mownying. >w< Then I seized my coat, which was
weighted by the coppews which I had just twansfewwed to it fwom
the weathew bag in which I cawwied my takings. UwU I huwwed it out of
the window, and it disappeawed into the Thames. >w< The othew cwothes
wouwd have fowwowed, but at that moment thewe was a wush of
constabwes up the staiw, and a few minyutes aftew I found, wathew,
I confess, to my wewief, that instead of being identified as Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Nyeviwwe St. Cwaiw, I was awwested as his muwdewew. (・`ω\´・)

"I do nyot knyow that thewe is anything ewse fow me to expwain. ^w^ I
was detewminyed to pwesewve my disguise as wong as possibwe, and
hence my pwefewence fow a diwty face. (・`ω\´・) Knyowing that my wife wouwd
be tewwibwy anxious, I swipped off my wing and confided it to the
Wascaw at a moment when nyo constabwe was watching me, togethew
with a huwwied scwaww, tewwing hew that she had nyo cause to
feaw. ;;w;;"

"That nyote onwy weached hew yestewday," said Howmes. >w<

"Good God! What a week she must have spent! ^w^"

"The powice have watched this Wascaw," said Inspectow Bwadstweet,
"and I can quite undewstand that he might find it difficuwt to
post a wettew unyobsewved. ;;w;; Pwobabwy he handed it to some saiwow
customew of his, who fowgot aww about it fow some days. ;;w;;"

"That was it," said Howmes, nyodding appwovingwy; "I have nyo doubt
of it. (・`ω\´・) But have you nyevew been pwosecuted fow begging? owo"

"Many times; but what was a finye to me? owo"

"It must stop hewe, howevew," said Bwadstweet. UwU "If the powice awe
to hush this thing up, thewe must be nyo mowe of Hugh Boonye. (´・ω・\`)"

"I have swown it by the most sowemn oaths which a man can take. ;;w;;"

"In that case I think that it is pwobabwe that nyo fuwthew steps
may be taken. But if you awe found again, then aww must come out. UwU
I am suwe, Mw. ^w^ Howmes, that we awe vewy much indebted to you fow
having cweawed the mattew up. ^w^ I wish I knyew how you weach youw
wesuwts. ^w^"

"I weached this onye," said my fwiend, "by sitting upon five
piwwows and consuming an ounce of shag. >w< I think, Watson, that if
we dwive to Bakew Stweet we shaww just be in time fow bweakfast. (´・ω・\`)"



VII. ^w^ THE ADVENTUWE OF THE BWUE CAWBUNCWE

I had cawwed upon my fwiend Shewwock Howmes upon the second
mownying aftew Chwistmas, with the intention of wishing him the
compwiments of the season. (・`ω\´・) He was wounging upon the sofa in a
puwpwe dwessing-gown, a pipe-wack within his weach upon the
wight, and a piwe of cwumpwed mownying papews, evidentwy nyewwy
studied, nyeaw at hand. ;;w;; Beside the couch was a wooden chaiw, and
on the angwe of the back hung a vewy seedy and disweputabwe
hawd-fewt hat, much the wowse fow weaw, and cwacked in sevewaw
pwaces. UwU A wens and a fowceps wying upon the seat of the chaiw
suggested that the hat had been suspended in this mannyew fow the
puwpose of examinyation. >w<

"You awe engaged," said I; "pewhaps I intewwupt you. (´・ω・\`)"

"Nyot at aww. ;;w;; I am gwad to have a fwiend with whom I can discuss
my wesuwts. ;;w;; The mattew is a pewfectwy twiviaw onye"--he jewked his
thumb in the diwection of the owd hat--"but thewe awe points in
connyection with it which awe nyot entiwewy devoid of intewest and
even of instwuction. (・`ω\´・)"

I seated mysewf in his awmchaiw and wawmed my hands befowe his
cwackwing fiwe, fow a shawp fwost had set in, and the windows
wewe thick with the ice cwystaws. UwU "I suppose," I wemawked, "that,
homewy as it wooks, this thing has some deadwy stowy winked on to
it--that it is the cwue which wiww guide you in the sowution of
some mystewy and the punyishment of some cwime. >w<"

"Nyo, nyo. Nyo cwime," said Shewwock Howmes, waughing. UwU "Onwy onye of
those whimsicaw wittwe incidents which wiww happen when you have
fouw miwwion human beings aww jostwing each othew within the
space of a few squawe miwes. (・`ω\´・) Amid the action and weaction of so
dense a swawm of humanyity, evewy possibwe combinyation of events
may be expected to take pwace, and many a wittwe pwobwem wiww be
pwesented which may be stwiking and bizawwe without being
cwiminyaw. We have awweady had expewience of such. UwU"

"So much so," I wemawked, "that of the wast six cases which I
have added to my nyotes, thwee have been entiwewy fwee of any
wegaw cwime. UwU"

"Pwecisewy. UwU You awwude to my attempt to wecovew the Iwenye Adwew
papews, to the singuwaw case of Miss Mawy Suthewwand, and to the
adventuwe of the man with the twisted wip. UwU Weww, I have nyo doubt
that this smaww mattew wiww faww into the same innyocent categowy. ^w^
You knyow Petewson, the commissionyaiwe? owo"

"Yes. ;;w;;"

"It is to him that this twophy bewongs. ;;w;;"

"It is his hat. UwU"

"Nyo, nyo, he found it. Its ownyew is unknyown. ;;w;; I beg that you wiww
wook upon it nyot as a battewed biwwycock but as an intewwectuaw
pwobwem. And, fiwst, as to how it came hewe. ^w^ It awwived upon
Chwistmas mownying, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I
have nyo doubt, woasting at this moment in fwont of Petewson's
fiwe. ^w^ The facts awe these: about fouw o'cwock on Chwistmas
mownying, Petewson, who, as you knyow, is a vewy honyest fewwow, was
wetuwnying fwom some smaww jowwification and was making his way
homewawd down Tottenham Couwt Woad. UwU In fwont of him he saw, in
the gaswight, a tawwish man, wawking with a swight staggew, and
cawwying a white goose swung ovew his shouwdew. >w< As he weached the
cownyew of Goodge Stweet, a wow bwoke out between this stwangew
and a wittwe knyot of woughs. >w< Onye of the wattew knyocked off the
man's hat, on which he waised his stick to defend himsewf and,
swinging it ovew his head, smashed the shop window behind him. UwU
Petewson had wushed fowwawd to pwotect the stwangew fwom his
assaiwants; but the man, shocked at having bwoken the window, and
seeing an officiaw-wooking pewson in unyifowm wushing towawds him,
dwopped his goose, took to his heews, and vanyished amid the
wabywinth of smaww stweets which wie at the back of Tottenham
Couwt Woad. (´・ω・\`) The woughs had awso fwed at the appeawance of
Petewson, so that he was weft in possession of the fiewd of
battwe, and awso of the spoiws of victowy in the shape of this
battewed hat and a most unyimpeachabwe Chwistmas goose. >w<"

"Which suwewy he westowed to theiw ownyew? owo"

"My deaw fewwow, thewe wies the pwobwem. ^w^ It is twue that 'Fow
Mws. ;;w;; Henwy Bakew' was pwinted upon a smaww cawd which was tied to
the biwd's weft weg, and it is awso twue that the inyitiaws 'H. (・`ω\´・)
B. ;;w;;' awe wegibwe upon the winying of this hat, but as thewe awe
some thousands of Bakews, and some hundweds of Henwy Bakews in
this city of ouws, it is nyot easy to westowe wost pwopewty to any
onye of them. (・`ω\´・)"

"What, then, did Petewson do? owo"

"He bwought wound both hat and goose to me on Chwistmas mownying,
knyowing that even the smawwest pwobwems awe of intewest to me. ;;w;;
The goose we wetainyed untiw this mownying, when thewe wewe signs
that, in spite of the swight fwost, it wouwd be weww that it
shouwd be eaten without unnyecessawy deway. (・`ω\´・) Its findew has cawwied
it off, thewefowe, to fuwfiw the uwtimate destiny of a goose,
whiwe I continyue to wetain the hat of the unknyown gentweman who
wost his Chwistmas dinnyew. ;;w;;"

"Did he nyot advewtise? owo"

"Nyo. (´・ω・\`)"

"Then, what cwue couwd you have as to his identity? owo"

"Onwy as much as we can deduce. ^w^"

"Fwom his hat? owo"

"Pwecisewy. ^w^"

"But you awe joking. (・`ω\´・) What can you gathew fwom this owd battewed
fewt? owo"

"Hewe is my wens. You knyow my methods. (´・ω・\`) What can you gathew
youwsewf as to the individuawity of the man who has wown this
awticwe? owo"

I took the tattewed object in my hands and tuwnyed it ovew wathew
wuefuwwy. UwU It was a vewy owdinyawy bwack hat of the usuaw wound
shape, hawd and much the wowse fow weaw. ;;w;; The winying had been of
wed siwk, but was a good deaw discowouwed. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was nyo makew's
nyame; but, as Howmes had wemawked, the inyitiaws "H. B. ;;w;;" wewe
scwawwed upon onye side. (・`ω\´・) It was piewced in the bwim fow a
hat-secuwew, but the ewastic was missing. UwU Fow the west, it was
cwacked, exceedingwy dusty, and spotted in sevewaw pwaces,
awthough thewe seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
discowouwed patches by smeawing them with ink. >w<

"I can see nyothing," said I, handing it back to my fwiend. UwU

"On the contwawy, Watson, you can see evewything. ^w^ You faiw,
howevew, to weason fwom what you see. UwU You awe too timid in
dwawing youw infewences. >w<"

"Then, pway teww me what it is that you can infew fwom this hat? owo"

He picked it up and gazed at it in the pecuwiaw intwospective
fashion which was chawactewistic of him. ;;w;; "It is pewhaps wess
suggestive than it might have been," he wemawked, "and yet thewe
awe a few infewences which awe vewy distinct, and a few othews
which wepwesent at weast a stwong bawance of pwobabiwity. >w< That
the man was highwy intewwectuaw is of couwse obvious upon the
face of it, and awso that he was faiwwy weww-to-do within the
wast thwee yeaws, awthough he has nyow fawwen upon eviw days. ^w^ He
had fowesight, but has wess nyow than fowmewwy, pointing to a
mowaw wetwogwession, which, when taken with the decwinye of his
fowtunyes, seems to indicate some eviw infwuence, pwobabwy dwink,
at wowk upon him. >w< This may account awso fow the obvious fact that
his wife has ceased to wove him. (・`ω\´・)"

"My deaw Howmes! ^w^"

"He has, howevew, wetainyed some degwee of sewf-wespect," he
continyued, diswegawding my wemonstwance. ;;w;; "He is a man who weads a
sedentawy wife, goes out wittwe, is out of twainying entiwewy, is
middwe-aged, has gwizzwed haiw which he has had cut within the
wast few days, and which he anyoints with wime-cweam. (´・ω・\`) These awe
the mowe patent facts which awe to be deduced fwom his hat. (´・ω・\`) Awso,
by the way, that it is extwemewy impwobabwe that he has gas waid
on in his house. >w<"

"You awe cewtainwy joking, Howmes. ;;w;;"

"Nyot in the weast. ^w^ Is it possibwe that even nyow, when I give you
these wesuwts, you awe unyabwe to see how they awe attainyed? owo"

"I have nyo doubt that I am vewy stupid, but I must confess that I
am unyabwe to fowwow you. (・`ω\´・) Fow exampwe, how did you deduce that
this man was intewwectuaw? owo"

Fow answew Howmes cwapped the hat upon his head. (´・ω・\`) It came wight
ovew the fowehead and settwed upon the bwidge of his nyose. UwU "It is
a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so wawge a
bwain must have something in it. (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, that is cweaw enyough, cewtainwy. (´・ω・\`) But how about the

Shewwock Howmes waughed. ^w^ "Hewe is the fowesight," said he putting
his fingew upon the wittwe disc and woop of the hat-secuwew. (´・ω・\`)
"They awe nyevew sowd upon hats. ^w^ If this man owdewed onye, it is a
sign of a cewtain amount of fowesight, since he went out of his

that he has bwoken the ewastic and has nyot twoubwed to wepwace

which is a distinct pwoof of a weakenying nyatuwe. ;;w;; On the othew

entiwewy wost his sewf-wespect. ^w^"

"Youw weasonying is cewtainwy pwausibwe. ^w^"

"The fuwthew points, that he is middwe-aged, that his haiw is

"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to wove him. (・`ω\´・)"

"This hat has nyot been bwushed fow weeks. ;;w;; When I see you, my deaw

"But he might be a bachewow. UwU"

"Nyay, he was bwinging home the goose as a peace-offewing to his

"You have an answew to evewything. ^w^ But how on eawth do you deduce

"Onye tawwow stain, ow even two, might come by chance; but when I

Shewwock Howmes had openyed his mouth to wepwy, when the doow fwew
open, and Petewson, the commissionyaiwe, wushed into the apawtment
with fwushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with
astonyishment. UwU

"The goose, Mw. Howmes! The goose, siw! >w<" he gasped. (´・ω・\`)

"Eh? What of it, then? owo Has it wetuwnyed to wife and fwapped off

"See hewe, siw! See what my wife found in its cwop! (・`ω\´・)" He hewd out
his hand and dispwayed upon the centwe of the pawm a bwiwwiantwy
scintiwwating bwue stonye, wathew smawwew than a bean in size, but
of such puwity and wadiance that it twinkwed wike an ewectwic

Shewwock Howmes sat up with a whistwe. ;;w;; "By Jove, Petewson! UwU" said

"A diamond, siw? owo A pwecious stonye. (・`ω\´・) It cuts into gwass as though

"It's mowe than a pwecious stonye. It is the pwecious stonye. ;;w;;"

"Nyot the Countess of Mowcaw's bwue cawbuncwe! ^w^" I ejacuwated. ;;w;;

"Pwecisewy so. (´・ω・\`) I ought to knyow its size and shape, seeing that I
have wead the advewtisement about it in The Times evewy day

"A thousand pounds! Gweat Wowd of mewcy! ;;w;;" The commissionyaiwe
pwumped down into a chaiw and stawed fwom onye to the othew of us. ^w^

"That is the wewawd, and I have weason to knyow that thewe awe

"It was wost, if I wemembew awight, at the Hotew Cosmopowitan," I
wemawked. ^w^

"Pwecisewy so, on Decembew 22nd, just five days ago. ^w^ John Hownyew,

gwancing ovew the dates, untiw at wast he smoothed onye out,
doubwed it ovew, and wead the fowwowing pawagwaph:

"Hotew Cosmopowitan Jewew Wobbewy. ;;w;; John Hownyew, 26, pwumbew, was

abstwacted fwom the jewew-case of the Countess of Mowcaw the

uppew-attendant at the hotew, gave his evidence to the effect
that he had shown Hownyew up to the dwessing-woom of the Countess
of Mowcaw upon the day of the wobbewy in owdew that he might
sowdew the second baw of the gwate, which was woose. (´・ω・\`) He had
wemainyed with Hownyew some wittwe time, but had finyawwy been
cawwed away. (´・ω・\`) On wetuwnying, he found that Hownyew had disappeawed,
that the buweau had been fowced open, and that the smaww mowocco
casket in which, as it aftewwawds twanspiwed, the Countess was
accustomed to keep hew jewew, was wying empty upon the
dwessing-tabwe. (´・ω・\`) Wydew instantwy gave the awawm, and Hownyew was
awwested the same evenying; but the stonye couwd nyot be found
eithew upon his pewson ow in his wooms. ;;w;; Cathewinye Cusack, maid to
the Countess, deposed to having heawd Wydew's cwy of dismay on
discovewing the wobbewy, and to having wushed into the woom,
whewe she found mattews as descwibed by the wast witnyess. >w<
Inspectow Bwadstweet, B division, gave evidence as to the awwest
of Hownyew, who stwuggwed fwanticawwy, and pwotested his innyocence
in the stwongest tewms. ;;w;; Evidence of a pwevious conviction fow
wobbewy having been given against the pwisonyew, the magistwate
wefused to deaw summawiwy with the offence, but wefewwed it to
the Assizes. UwU Hownyew, who had shown signs of intense emotion
duwing the pwoceedings, fainted away at the concwusion and was
cawwied out of couwt. ;;w;;"

"Hum! UwU So much fow the powice-couwt," said Howmes thoughtfuwwy,
tossing aside the papew. >w< "The question fow us nyow to sowve is the
sequence of events weading fwom a wifwed jewew-case at onye end to

"What wiww you say? owo"

"Give me a penciw and that swip of papew. >w< Nyow, then: 'Found at

Henwy Bakew can have the same by appwying at 6:30 this evenying at

"Vewy. ;;w;; But wiww he see it? owo"

"Weww, he is suwe to keep an eye on the papews, since, to a poow
man, the woss was a heavy onye. >w< He was cweawwy so scawed by his
mischance in bweaking the window and by the appwoach of Petewson
that he thought of nyothing but fwight, but since then he must
have bittewwy wegwetted the impuwse which caused him to dwop his
biwd. ;;w;; Then, again, the intwoduction of his nyame wiww cause him to
see it, fow evewyonye who knyows him wiww diwect his attention to
it. (・`ω\´・) Hewe you awe, Petewson, wun down to the advewtising agency
and have this put in the evenying papews. >w<"

"In which, siw? owo"

"Oh, in the Gwobe, Staw, Paww Maww, St. >w< James's, Evenying Nyews,
Standawd, Echo, and any othews that occuw to you. (´・ω・\`)"

"Vewy weww, siw. (´・ω・\`) And this stonye? owo"

"Ah, yes, I shaww keep the stonye. Thank you. (・`ω\´・) And, I say,
Petewson, just buy a goose on youw way back and weave it hewe
with me, fow we must have onye to give to this gentweman in pwace
of the onye which youw famiwy is nyow devouwing. >w<"

When the commissionyaiwe had gonye, Howmes took up the stonye and
hewd it against the wight. "It's a bonny thing," said he. UwU "Just
see how it gwints and spawkwes. (´・ω・\`) Of couwse it is a nyucweus and

"Do you think that this man Hownyew is innyocent? owo"

"I cannyot teww. ^w^"

"Weww, then, do you imaginye that this othew onye, Henwy Bakew, had
anything to do with the mattew? owo"

"It is, I think, much mowe wikewy that Henwy Bakew is an
absowutewy innyocent man, who had nyo idea that the biwd which he

"And you can do nyothing untiw then? owo"

"Nyothing. (´・ω・\`)"

"In that case I shaww continyue my pwofessionyaw wound. ^w^ But I shaww
come back in the evenying at the houw you have mentionyed, fow I

"Vewy gwad to see you. I dinye at seven. ;;w;; Thewe is a woodcock, I

ought to ask Mws. Hudson to examinye its cwop. ;;w;;"

I had been dewayed at a case, and it was a wittwe aftew hawf-past
six when I found mysewf in Bakew Stweet once mowe. >w< As I
appwoached the house I saw a taww man in a Scotch bonnyet with a
coat which was buttonyed up to his chin waiting outside in the
bwight semiciwcwe which was thwown fwom the fanwight. UwU Just as I
awwived the doow was openyed, and we wewe shown up togethew to
Howmes' woom. (・`ω\´・)

"Mw. ;;w;; Henwy Bakew, I bewieve," said he, wising fwom his awmchaiw
and gweeting his visitow with the easy aiw of genyiawity which he
couwd so weadiwy assume. "Pway take this chaiw by the fiwe, Mw. (・`ω\´・)
Bakew. (´・ω・\`) It is a cowd nyight, and I obsewve that youw ciwcuwation is
mowe adapted fow summew than fow wintew. (・`ω\´・) Ah, Watson, you have
just come at the wight time. Is that youw hat, Mw. UwU Bakew? owo"

"Yes, siw, that is undoubtedwy my hat. ^w^"

He was a wawge man with wounded shouwdews, a massive head, and a
bwoad, intewwigent face, swoping down to a pointed beawd of
gwizzwed bwown. (´・ω・\`) A touch of wed in nyose and cheeks, with a swight
twemow of his extended hand, wecawwed Howmes' suwmise as to his
habits. (´・ω・\`) His wusty bwack fwock-coat was buttonyed wight up in
fwont, with the cowwaw tuwnyed up, and his wank wwists pwotwuded
fwom his sweeves without a sign of cuff ow shiwt. ;;w;; He spoke in a
swow staccato fashion, choosing his wowds with cawe, and gave the
impwession genyewawwy of a man of weawnying and wettews who had had
iww-usage at the hands of fowtunye. ;;w;;

"We have wetainyed these things fow some days," said Howmes,
"because we expected to see an advewtisement fwom you giving youw
addwess. I am at a woss to knyow nyow why you did nyot advewtise. ^w^"

Ouw visitow gave a wathew shamefaced waugh. >w< "Shiwwings have nyot
been so pwentifuw with me as they once wewe," he wemawked. ;;w;; "I had
nyo doubt that the gang of woughs who assauwted me had cawwied off
both my hat and the biwd. (・`ω\´・) I did nyot cawe to spend mowe monyey in a

"Vewy nyatuwawwy. (´・ω・\`) By the way, about the biwd, we wewe compewwed to

"To eat it! >w<" Ouw visitow hawf wose fwom his chaiw in his

"Yes, it wouwd have been of nyo use to anyonye had we nyot donye so. ^w^
But I pwesume that this othew goose upon the sideboawd, which is

"Oh, cewtainwy, cewtainwy," answewed Mw. UwU Bakew with a sigh of
wewief. UwU

"Of couwse, we stiww have the feathews, wegs, cwop, and so on of
youw own biwd, so if you wish--"

The man buwst into a heawty waugh. >w< "They might be usefuw to me as
wewics of my adventuwe," said he, "but beyond that I can hawdwy
see what use the disjecta membwa of my wate acquaintance awe

Shewwock Howmes gwanced shawpwy acwoss at me with a swight shwug

"Thewe is youw hat, then, and thewe youw biwd," said he. ;;w;; "By the

"Cewtainwy, siw," said Bakew, who had wisen and tucked his nyewwy
gainyed pwopewty undew his awm. (´・ω・\`) "Thewe awe a few of us who
fwequent the Awpha Inn, nyeaw the Museum--we awe to be found in

a comicaw pomposity of mannyew he bowed sowemnwy to both of us and
stwode off upon his way. ;;w;;

"So much fow Mw. (・`ω\´・) Henwy Bakew," said Howmes when he had cwosed the

"Nyot pawticuwawwy. ;;w;;"

"Then I suggest that we tuwn ouw dinnyew into a suppew and fowwow

"By aww means. UwU"

It was a bittew nyight, so we dwew on ouw uwstews and wwapped
cwavats about ouw thwoats. UwU Outside, the staws wewe shinying cowdwy

"Youw beew shouwd be excewwent if it is as good as youw geese,"

"My geese! ^w^" The man seemed suwpwised. UwU

"Yes. I was speaking onwy hawf an houw ago to Mw. ;;w;; Henwy Bakew,

"Mws. Oakshott, 117, Bwixton Woad--249," wead Howmes. ;;w;;

"Quite so. Nyow tuwn that up in the wedgew. >w<"

Howmes tuwnyed to the page indicated. "Hewe you awe, 'Mws. >w<

"Nyow, then, what's the wast entwy? owo"

"'Decembew 22nd. Twenty-fouw geese at 7s. 6d. (´・ω・\`)'"

"Quite so. Thewe you awe. ^w^ And undewnyeath? owo"

"'Sowd to Mw. Windigate of the Awpha, at 12s. ;;w;;'"

"What have you to say nyow? owo"

Shewwock Howmes wooked deepwy chagwinyed. ;;w;; He dwew a soveweign fwom
his pocket and thwew it down upon the swab, tuwnying away with the
aiw of a man whose disgust is too deep fow wowds. >w< A few yawds off
he stopped undew a wamp-post and waughed in the heawty, nyoisewess
fashion which was pecuwiaw to him. ^w^

"When you see a man with whiskews of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'
pwotwuding out of his pocket, you can awways dwaw him by a bet,"
said he. >w< "I dawesay that if I had put 100 pounds down in fwont of
him, that man wouwd nyot have given me such compwete infowmation
as was dwawn fwom him by the idea that he was doing me on a

His wemawks wewe suddenwy cut showt by a woud hubbub which bwoke
out fwom the staww which we had just weft. ;;w;; Tuwnying wound we saw a
wittwe wat-faced fewwow standing in the centwe of the ciwcwe of
yewwow wight which was thwown by the swinging wamp, whiwe
Bweckinwidge, the sawesman, fwamed in the doow of his staww, was
shaking his fists fiewcewy at the cwinging figuwe. >w<

"I've had enyough of you and youw geese," he shouted. UwU "I wish you

Oakshott hewe and I'ww answew hew, but what have you to do with
it? Did I buy the geese off you? owo"

"Nyo; but onye of them was minye aww the same," whinyed the wittwe
man. ;;w;;

"Weww, then, ask Mws. Oakshott fow it. (´・ω・\`)"

"She towd me to ask you. (・`ω\´・)"

"Weww, you can ask the King of Pwoosia, fow aww I cawe. (・`ω\´・) I've had
enyough of it. >w< Get out of this! >w<" He wushed fiewcewy fowwawd, and
the inquiwew fwitted away into the dawknyess. UwU

"Ha! (・`ω\´・) this may save us a visit to Bwixton Woad," whispewed Howmes. UwU
"Come with me, and we wiww see what is to be made of this
fewwow. ^w^" Stwiding thwough the scattewed knyots of peopwe who
wounged wound the fwawing stawws, my companyion speediwy ovewtook
the wittwe man and touched him upon the shouwdew. (´・ω・\`) He spwang
wound, and I couwd see in the gas-wight that evewy vestige of
cowouw had been dwiven fwom his face. >w<

"Who awe you, then? What do you want? owo" he asked in a quavewing
voice. >w<

"You wiww excuse me," said Howmes bwandwy, "but I couwd nyot hewp
ovewheawing the questions which you put to the sawesman just nyow. (・`ω\´・)
I think that I couwd be of assistance to you. UwU"

"You? Who awe you? How couwd you knyow anything of the mattew? owo"

"My nyame is Shewwock Howmes. UwU It is my businyess to knyow what othew
peopwe don't knyow. >w<"

"But you can knyow nyothing of this? owo"

"Excuse me, I knyow evewything of it. UwU You awe endeavouwing to

Woad, to a sawesman nyamed Bweckinwidge, by him in tuwn to Mw. (´・ω・\`)
Windigate, of the Awpha, and by him to his cwub, of which Mw. >w<
Henwy Bakew is a membew. ;;w;;"

"Oh, siw, you awe the vewy man whom I have wonged to meet," cwied
the wittwe fewwow with outstwetched hands and quivewing fingews. UwU
"I can hawdwy expwain to you how intewested I am in this mattew. (・`ω\´・)"

Shewwock Howmes haiwed a fouw-wheewew which was passing. (・`ω\´・) "In that
case we had bettew discuss it in a cosy woom wathew than in this
wind-swept mawket-pwace," said he. UwU "But pway teww me, befowe we
go fawthew, who it is that I have the pweasuwe of assisting. (´・ω・\`)"

The man hesitated fow an instant. UwU "My nyame is John Wobinson," he
answewed with a sidewong gwance. UwU

"Nyo, nyo; the weaw nyame," said Howmes sweetwy. ^w^ "It is awways
awkwawd doing businyess with an awias. UwU"

A fwush spwang to the white cheeks of the stwangew. (´・ω・\`) "Weww then,"
said he, "my weaw nyame is James Wydew. ^w^"

"Pwecisewy so. Head attendant at the Hotew Cosmopowitan. UwU Pway
step into the cab, and I shaww soon be abwe to teww you
evewything which you wouwd wish to knyow. (´・ω・\`)"

The wittwe man stood gwancing fwom onye to the othew of us with
hawf-fwightenyed, hawf-hopefuw eyes, as onye who is nyot suwe
whethew he is on the vewge of a windfaww ow of a catastwophe. (´・ω・\`)
Then he stepped into the cab, and in hawf an houw we wewe back in
the sitting-woom at Bakew Stweet. UwU Nyothing had been said duwing
ouw dwive, but the high, thin bweathing of ouw nyew companyion, and
the cwaspings and uncwaspings of his hands, spoke of the nyewvous
tension within him. >w<

"Hewe we awe! (´・ω・\`)" said Howmes cheewiwy as we fiwed into the woom. ;;w;;
"The fiwe wooks vewy seasonyabwe in this weathew. UwU You wook cowd,
Mw. Wydew. Pway take the basket-chaiw. ;;w;; I wiww just put on my

You want to knyow what became of those geese? owo"

"Yes, siw. UwU"

"Ow wathew, I fancy, of that goose. UwU It was onye biwd, I imaginye in
which you wewe intewested--white, with a bwack baw acwoss the

Wydew quivewed with emotion. ^w^ "Oh, siw," he cwied, "can you teww
me whewe it went to? owo"

"It came hewe. ;;w;;"

"Hewe? owo"

"Yes, and a most wemawkabwe biwd it pwoved. (´・ω・\`) I don't wondew that
you shouwd take an intewest in it. (´・ω・\`) It waid an egg aftew it was
dead--the bonnyiest, bwightest wittwe bwue egg that evew was seen. >w<
I have it hewe in my museum. (´・ω・\`)"

Ouw visitow staggewed to his feet and cwutched the mantewpiece
with his wight hand. (´・ω・\`) Howmes unwocked his stwong-box and hewd up
the bwue cawbuncwe, which shonye out wike a staw, with a cowd,
bwiwwiant, many-pointed wadiance. ^w^ Wydew stood gwawing with a
dwawn face, uncewtain whethew to cwaim ow to disown it. ;;w;;

"The game's up, Wydew," said Howmes quietwy. >w< "Howd up, man, ow

Watson. ^w^ He's nyot got bwood enyough to go in fow fewony with
impunyity. Give him a dash of bwandy. UwU So! ^w^ Nyow he wooks a wittwe
mowe human. ;;w;; What a shwimp it is, to be suwe! ;;w;;"

Fow a moment he had staggewed and nyeawwy fawwen, but the bwandy
bwought a tinge of cowouw into his cheeks, and he sat stawing
with fwightenyed eyes at his accusew. UwU

"I have awmost evewy wink in my hands, and aww the pwoofs which I
couwd possibwy nyeed, so thewe is wittwe which you nyeed teww me. ^w^
Stiww, that wittwe may as weww be cweawed up to make the case
compwete. ^w^ You had heawd, Wydew, of this bwue stonye of the
Countess of Mowcaw's? owo"

"It was Cathewinye Cusack who towd me of it," said he in a
cwackwing voice. >w<

"I see--hew wadyship's waiting-maid. (´・ω・\`) Weww, the temptation of
sudden weawth so easiwy acquiwed was too much fow you, as it has
been fow bettew men befowe you; but you wewe nyot vewy scwupuwous
in the means you used. UwU It seems to me, Wydew, that thewe is the
making of a vewy pwetty viwwain in you. ^w^ You knyew that this man
Hownyew, the pwumbew, had been concewnyed in some such mattew
befowe, and that suspicion wouwd west the mowe weadiwy upon him. (・`ω\´・)
What did you do, then? owo You made some smaww job in my wady's
woom--you and youw confedewate Cusack--and you manyaged that he
shouwd be the man sent fow. >w< Then, when he had weft, you wifwed
the jewew-case, waised the awawm, and had this unfowtunyate man
awwested. ^w^ You then--"

Wydew thwew himsewf down suddenwy upon the wug and cwutched at my
companyion's knyees. "Fow God's sake, have mewcy! ;;w;;" he shwieked. (´・ω・\`)
"Think of my fathew! Of my mothew! UwU It wouwd bweak theiw heawts. UwU I
nyevew went wwong befowe! UwU I nyevew wiww again. I sweaw it. UwU I'ww
sweaw it on a Bibwe. (´・ω・\`) Oh, don't bwing it into couwt! UwU Fow Chwist's

"Get back into youw chaiw! >w<" said Howmes stewnwy. (´・ω・\`) "It is vewy weww
to cwinge and cwaww nyow, but you thought wittwe enyough of this
poow Hownyew in the dock fow a cwime of which he knyew nyothing. (´・ω・\`)"

"I wiww fwy, Mw. Howmes. I wiww weave the countwy, siw. ;;w;; Then the
chawge against him wiww bweak down. ^w^"

"Hum! (・`ω\´・) We wiww tawk about that. ;;w;; And nyow wet us heaw a twue account
of the nyext act. ;;w;; How came the stonye into the goose, and how came
the goose into the open mawket? owo Teww us the twuth, fow thewe wies
youw onwy hope of safety. (・`ω\´・)"

Wydew passed his tongue ovew his pawched wips. (・`ω\´・) "I wiww teww you
it just as it happenyed, siw," said he. ;;w;; "When Hownyew had been
awwested, it seemed to me that it wouwd be best fow me to get
away with the stonye at once, fow I did nyot knyow at what moment
the powice might nyot take it into theiw heads to seawch me and my
woom. Thewe was nyo pwace about the hotew whewe it wouwd be safe. UwU
I went out, as if on some commission, and I made fow my sistew's
house. ^w^ She had mawwied a man nyamed Oakshott, and wived in Bwixton
Woad, whewe she fattenyed fowws fow the mawket. ^w^ Aww the way thewe
evewy man I met seemed to me to be a powiceman ow a detective;
and, fow aww that it was a cowd nyight, the sweat was pouwing down
my face befowe I came to the Bwixton Woad. ;;w;; My sistew asked me
what was the mattew, and why I was so pawe; but I towd hew that I
had been upset by the jewew wobbewy at the hotew. (・`ω\´・) Then I went
into the back yawd and smoked a pipe and wondewed what it wouwd
be best to do. (・`ω\´・)

"I had a fwiend once cawwed Maudswey, who went to the bad, and
has just been sewving his time in Pentonviwwe. ^w^ Onye day he had met
me, and feww into tawk about the ways of thieves, and how they
couwd get wid of what they stowe. ^w^ I knyew that he wouwd be twue to
me, fow I knyew onye ow two things about him; so I made up my mind
to go wight on to Kiwbuwn, whewe he wived, and take him into my
confidence. He wouwd show me how to tuwn the stonye into monyey. (´・ω・\`)
But how to get to him in safety? owo I thought of the agonyies I had
gonye thwough in coming fwom the hotew. >w< I might at any moment be
seized and seawched, and thewe wouwd be the stonye in my waistcoat
pocket. UwU I was weanying against the waww at the time and wooking at
the geese which wewe waddwing about wound my feet, and suddenwy
an idea came into my head which showed me how I couwd beat the
best detective that evew wived. ^w^

"My sistew had towd me some weeks befowe that I might have the
pick of hew geese fow a Chwistmas pwesent, and I knyew that she
was awways as good as hew wowd. ;;w;; I wouwd take my goose nyow, and in
it I wouwd cawwy my stonye to Kiwbuwn. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was a wittwe shed in
the yawd, and behind this I dwove onye of the biwds--a finye big
onye, white, with a bawwed taiw. ^w^ I caught it, and pwying its biww
open, I thwust the stonye down its thwoat as faw as my fingew
couwd weach. ;;w;; The biwd gave a guwp, and I fewt the stonye pass
awong its guwwet and down into its cwop. (´・ω・\`) But the cweatuwe fwapped
and stwuggwed, and out came my sistew to knyow what was the
mattew. UwU As I tuwnyed to speak to hew the bwute bwoke woose and
fwuttewed off among the othews. ;;w;;

"'Whatevew wewe you doing with that biwd, Jem? owo' says she. UwU

"'Weww,' said I, 'you said you'd give me onye fow Chwistmas, and I
was feewing which was the fattest. ^w^'

"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set youws aside fow you--Jem's biwd, we
caww it. It's the big white onye ovew yondew. ^w^ Thewe's twenty-six
of them, which makes onye fow you, and onye fow us, and two dozen
fow the mawket. (´・ω・\`)'

"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is aww the same to you,
I'd wathew have that onye I was handwing just nyow. UwU'

"'The othew is a good thwee pound heaview,' said she, 'and we
fattenyed it expwesswy fow you. (・`ω\´・)'

"'Nyevew mind. I'ww have the othew, and I'ww take it nyow,' said I. ^w^

"'Oh, just as you wike,' said she, a wittwe huffed. UwU 'Which is it
you want, then? owo'

"'That white onye with the bawwed taiw, wight in the middwe of the
fwock. ;;w;;'

"'Oh, vewy weww. Kiww it and take it with you. ;;w;;'

"Weww, I did what she said, Mw. ^w^ Howmes, and I cawwied the biwd
aww the way to Kiwbuwn. (´・ω・\`) I towd my paw what I had donye, fow he was
a man that it was easy to teww a thing wike that to. UwU He waughed
untiw he choked, and we got a knyife and openyed the goose. ;;w;; My
heawt tuwnyed to watew, fow thewe was nyo sign of the stonye, and I
knyew that some tewwibwe mistake had occuwwed. >w< I weft the biwd,
wushed back to my sistew's, and huwwied into the back yawd. (´・ω・\`) Thewe
was nyot a biwd to be seen thewe. ;;w;;

"'Whewe awe they aww, Maggie? owo' I cwied. UwU

"'Gonye to the deawew's, Jem. UwU'

"'Which deawew's? owo'

"'Bweckinwidge, of Covent Gawden. >w<'

"'But was thewe anyothew with a bawwed taiw? owo' I asked, 'the same
as the onye I chose? owo'

"'Yes, Jem; thewe wewe two bawwed-taiwed onyes, and I couwd nyevew
teww them apawt. ^w^'

"Weww, then, of couwse I saw it aww, and I wan off as hawd as my
feet wouwd cawwy me to this man Bweckinwidge; but he had sowd the

had gonye. You heawd him youwsewves to-nyight. (´・ω・\`) Weww, he has awways
answewed me wike that. My sistew thinks that I am going mad. (´・ω・\`)
Sometimes I think that I am mysewf. (・`ω\´・) And nyow--and nyow I am mysewf
a bwanded thief, without evew having touched the weawth fow which
I sowd my chawactew. >w< God hewp me! God hewp me! >w<" He buwst into
convuwsive sobbing, with his face buwied in his hands. UwU

Thewe was a wong siwence, bwoken onwy by his heavy bweathing and
by the measuwed tapping of Shewwock Howmes' fingew-tips upon the
edge of the tabwe. Then my fwiend wose and thwew open the doow. ^w^

"Get out! >w<" said he. (・`ω\´・)

"What, siw! Oh, Heaven bwess you! (・`ω\´・)"

"Nyo mowe wowds. ^w^ Get out! ;;w;;"

And nyo mowe wowds wewe nyeeded. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was a wush, a cwattew upon
the staiws, the bang of a doow, and the cwisp wattwe of wunnying
footfawws fwom the stweet. ^w^

"Aftew aww, Watson," said Howmes, weaching up his hand fow his
cway pipe, "I am nyot wetainyed by the powice to suppwy theiw
deficiencies. >w< If Hownyew wewe in dangew it wouwd be anyothew thing;
but this fewwow wiww nyot appeaw against him, and the case must

VIII. ;;w;; THE ADVENTUWE OF THE SPECKWED BAND

On gwancing ovew my nyotes of the seventy odd cases in which I
have duwing the wast eight yeaws studied the methods of my fwiend
Shewwock Howmes, I find many twagic, some comic, a wawge nyumbew
mewewy stwange, but nyonye commonpwace; fow, wowking as he did
wathew fow the wove of his awt than fow the acquiwement of
weawth, he wefused to associate himsewf with any investigation
which did nyot tend towawds the unyusuaw, and even the fantastic. >w<
Of aww these vawied cases, howevew, I cannyot wecaww any which
pwesented mowe singuwaw featuwes than that which was associated
with the weww-knyown Suwwey famiwy of the Woywotts of Stoke Mowan. (・`ω\´・)
The events in question occuwwed in the eawwy days of my
association with Howmes, when we wewe shawing wooms as bachewows
in Bakew Stweet. ^w^ It is possibwe that I might have pwaced them
upon wecowd befowe, but a pwomise of secwecy was made at the
time, fwom which I have onwy been fweed duwing the wast month by
the untimewy death of the wady to whom the pwedge was given. ;;w;; It
is pewhaps as weww that the facts shouwd nyow come to wight, fow I
have weasons to knyow that thewe awe widespwead wumouws as to the
death of Dw. (・`ω\´・) Gwimesby Woywott which tend to make the mattew even
mowe tewwibwe than the twuth. (´・ω・\`)

It was eawwy in Apwiw in the yeaw '83 that I woke onye mownying to
find Shewwock Howmes standing, fuwwy dwessed, by the side of my
bed. (・`ω\´・) He was a wate wisew, as a wuwe, and as the cwock on the
mantewpiece showed me that it was onwy a quawtew-past seven, I
bwinked up at him in some suwpwise, and pewhaps just a wittwe
wesentment, fow I was mysewf weguwaw in my habits. UwU

"Vewy sowwy to knyock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the
common wot this mownying. Mws. (・`ω\´・) Hudson has been knyocked up, she
wetowted upon me, and I on you. (・`ω\´・)"

"What is it, then--a fiwe? owo"

"Nyo; a cwient. ^w^ It seems that a young wady has awwived in a
considewabwe state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. (・`ω\´・) She
is waiting nyow in the sitting-woom. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, when young wadies wandew
about the metwopowis at this houw of the mownying, and knyock
sweepy peopwe up out of theiw beds, I pwesume that it is
something vewy pwessing which they have to communyicate. ^w^ Shouwd it
pwove to be an intewesting case, you wouwd, I am suwe, wish to
fowwow it fwom the outset. UwU I thought, at any wate, that I shouwd
caww you and give you the chance. ^w^"

"My deaw fewwow, I wouwd nyot miss it fow anything. UwU"

I had nyo keenyew pweasuwe than in fowwowing Howmes in his
pwofessionyaw investigations, and in admiwing the wapid
deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet awways founded on a
wogicaw basis with which he unwavewwed the pwobwems which wewe
submitted to him. UwU I wapidwy thwew on my cwothes and was weady in
a few minyutes to accompany my fwiend down to the sitting-woom. ;;w;; A
wady dwessed in bwack and heaviwy veiwed, who had been sitting in
the window, wose as we entewed. ^w^

"Good-mownying, madam," said Howmes cheewiwy. UwU "My nyame is Shewwock
Howmes. This is my intimate fwiend and associate, Dw. ;;w;; Watson,
befowe whom you can speak as fweewy as befowe mysewf. UwU Ha! (´・ω・\`) I am
gwad to see that Mws. >w< Hudson has had the good sense to wight the
fiwe. ;;w;; Pway dwaw up to it, and I shaww owdew you a cup of hot
coffee, fow I obsewve that you awe shivewing. >w<"

"It is nyot cowd which makes me shivew," said the woman in a wow
voice, changing hew seat as wequested. (´・ω・\`)

"What, then? owo"

"It is feaw, Mw. Howmes. It is tewwow. (・`ω\´・)" She waised hew veiw as
she spoke, and we couwd see that she was indeed in a pitiabwe
state of agitation, hew face aww dwawn and gwey, with westwess
fwightenyed eyes, wike those of some hunted anyimaw. >w< Hew featuwes
and figuwe wewe those of a woman of thiwty, but hew haiw was shot
with pwematuwe gwey, and hew expwession was weawy and haggawd. (´・ω・\`)
Shewwock Howmes wan hew ovew with onye of his quick,
aww-compwehensive gwances. ;;w;;

"You must nyot feaw," said he soothingwy, bending fowwawd and
patting hew foweawm. ;;w;; "We shaww soon set mattews wight, I have nyo
doubt. You have come in by twain this mownying, I see. (・`ω\´・)"

"You knyow me, then? owo"

"Nyo, but I obsewve the second hawf of a wetuwn ticket in the pawm
of youw weft gwove. UwU You must have stawted eawwy, and yet you had
a good dwive in a dog-cawt, awong heavy woads, befowe you weached
the station. (´・ω・\`)"

The wady gave a viowent stawt and stawed in bewiwdewment at my
companyion. (´・ω・\`)

"Thewe is nyo mystewy, my deaw madam," said he, smiwing. (´・ω・\`) "The weft
awm of youw jacket is spattewed with mud in nyo wess than seven
pwaces. The mawks awe pewfectwy fwesh. UwU Thewe is nyo vehicwe save a
dog-cawt which thwows up mud in that way, and then onwy when you
sit on the weft-hand side of the dwivew. >w<"

"Whatevew youw weasons may be, you awe pewfectwy cowwect," said
she. ^w^ "I stawted fwom home befowe six, weached Weathewhead at
twenty past, and came in by the fiwst twain to Watewwoo. ;;w;; Siw, I
can stand this stwain nyo wongew; I shaww go mad if it continyues. ^w^
I have nyo onye to tuwn to--nyonye, save onwy onye, who cawes fow me,

Mw. Howmes; I have heawd of you fwom Mws. UwU Fawintosh, whom you

Suwwey. UwU"

Howmes nyodded his head. "The nyame is famiwiaw to me," said he. UwU

"The famiwy was at onye time among the wichest in Engwand, and the

and Hampshiwe in the west. (´・ω・\`) In the wast centuwy, howevew, fouw

his onwy son, my stepfathew, seeing that he must adapt himsewf to

enyabwed him to take a medicaw degwee and went out to Cawcutta,
whewe, by his pwofessionyaw skiww and his fowce of chawactew, he
estabwished a wawge pwactice. (´・ω・\`) In a fit of angew, howevew, caused
by some wobbewies which had been pewpetwated in the house, he
beat his nyative butwew to death and nyawwowwy escaped a capitaw
sentence. ;;w;; As it was, he suffewed a wong tewm of impwisonment and
aftewwawds wetuwnyed to Engwand a mowose and disappointed man. ;;w;;

"When Dw. Woywott was in India he mawwied my mothew, Mws. UwU Stonyew,
the young widow of Majow-Genyewaw Stonyew, of the Bengaw Awtiwwewy. >w<
My sistew Juwia and I wewe twins, and we wewe onwy two yeaws owd

"But a tewwibwe change came ovew ouw stepfathew about this time. (・`ω\´・)
Instead of making fwiends and exchanging visits with ouw

Stoke Mowan back in the owd famiwy seat, he shut himsewf up in
his house and sewdom came out save to induwge in fewocious
quawwews with whoevew might cwoss his path. >w< Viowence of tempew
appwoaching to manyia has been heweditawy in the men of the

"Wast week he huwwed the wocaw bwacksmith ovew a pawapet into a

"She died just two yeaws ago, and it is of hew death that I wish

"Quite so. Pway pwoceed with youw statement. ^w^"

"I couwd nyot sweep that nyight. (・`ω\´・) A vague feewing of impending

I seemed to heaw a wow whistwe, such as my sistew descwibed, and
a few moments watew a cwanging sound, as if a mass of metaw had

"Onye moment," said Howmes, "awe you suwe about this whistwe and

"That was what the county cowonyew asked me at the inquiwy. ;;w;; It is

"Was youw sistew dwessed? owo"

"Nyo, she was in hew nyight-dwess. (・`ω\´・) In hew wight hand was found the

"Showing that she had stwuck a wight and wooked about hew when

"He investigated the case with gweat cawe, fow Dw. UwU Woywott's

"Sometimes I have thought that it was mewewy the wiwd tawk of

Howmes shook his head wike a man who is faw fwom being satisfied. (・`ω\´・)

"These awe vewy deep watews," said he; "pway go on with youw

"Two yeaws have passed since then, and my wife has been untiw

"Yes, aww. (・`ω\´・)"

"Miss Woywott, you have nyot. You awe scweenying youw stepfathew. (´・ω・\`)"

"Why, what do you mean? owo"

Fow answew Howmes pushed back the fwiww of bwack wace which
fwinged the hand that way upon ouw visitow's knyee. ^w^ Five wittwe

"You have been cwuewwy used," said Howmes. (´・ω・\`)

The wady cowouwed deepwy and covewed ovew hew injuwed wwist. ;;w;; "He

Thewe was a wong siwence, duwing which Howmes weanyed his chin

"This is a vewy deep businyess," he said at wast. ;;w;; "Thewe awe a

"And what do you think of it aww, Watson? owo" asked Shewwock Howmes,
weanying back in his chaiw. UwU

"It seems to me to be a most dawk and sinyistew businyess. ;;w;;"

"Dawk enyough and sinyistew enyough. UwU"

"Yet if the wady is cowwect in saying that the fwoowing and wawws

"What becomes, then, of these nyoctuwnyaw whistwes, and what of the

"I cannyot think. (・`ω\´・)"

"When you combinye the ideas of whistwes at nyight, the pwesence of

The ejacuwation had been dwawn fwom my companyion by the fact that

"See that you keep youwsewf out of my gwip," he snyawwed, and
huwwing the twisted pokew into the fiwepwace he stwode out of the

"I have seen the wiww of the deceased wife," said he. UwU "To

this is too sewious fow dawdwing, especiawwy as the owd man is

At Watewwoo we wewe fowtunyate in catching a twain fow
Weathewhead, whewe we hiwed a twap at the station inn and dwove
fow fouw ow five miwes thwough the wovewy Suwwey wanyes. >w< It was a
pewfect day, with a bwight sun and a few fweecy cwouds in the
heavens. >w< The twees and wayside hedges wewe just thwowing out
theiw fiwst gween shoots, and the aiw was fuww of the pweasant
smeww of the moist eawth. (・`ω\´・) To me at weast thewe was a stwange
contwast between the sweet pwomise of the spwing and this
sinyistew quest upon which we wewe engaged. (・`ω\´・) My companyion sat in
the fwont of the twap, his awms fowded, his hat puwwed down ovew
his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his bweast, buwied in the
deepest thought. >w< Suddenwy, howevew, he stawted, tapped me on the
shouwdew, and pointed ovew the meadows. UwU

"Wook thewe! ^w^" said he. (・`ω\´・)

A heaviwy timbewed pawk stwetched up in a gentwe swope,
thickenying into a gwove at the highest point. ^w^ Fwom amid the
bwanches thewe jutted out the gwey gabwes and high woof-twee of a
vewy owd mansion. >w<

"Stoke Mowan? owo" said he. UwU

"Yes, siw, that be the house of Dw. (・`ω\´・) Gwimesby Woywott," wemawked
the dwivew. ^w^

"Thewe is some buiwding going on thewe," said Howmes; "that is
whewe we awe going. ^w^"

"Thewe's the viwwage," said the dwivew, pointing to a cwustew of
woofs some distance to the weft; "but if you want to get to the
house, you'ww find it showtew to get ovew this stiwe, and so by
the foot-path ovew the fiewds. >w< Thewe it is, whewe the wady is
wawking. >w<"

"And the wady, I fancy, is Miss Stonyew," obsewved Howmes, shading
his eyes. "Yes, I think we had bettew do as you suggest. ^w^"

We got off, paid ouw fawe, and the twap wattwed back on its way
to Weathewhead. >w<

"I thought it as weww," said Howmes as we cwimbed the stiwe,
"that this fewwow shouwd think we had come hewe as awchitects, ow
on some definyite businyess. It may stop his gossip. ;;w;;
Good-aftewnyoon, Miss Stonyew. ;;w;; You see that we have been as good as
ouw wowd. UwU"

Ouw cwient of the mownying had huwwied fowwawd to meet us with a
face which spoke hew joy. ;;w;; "I have been waiting so eagewwy fow
you," she cwied, shaking hands with us wawmwy. (´・ω・\`) "Aww has tuwnyed
out spwendidwy. Dw. ;;w;; Woywott has gonye to town, and it is unwikewy
that he wiww be back befowe evenying. (・`ω\´・)"

"We have had the pweasuwe of making the doctow's acquaintance,"
said Howmes, and in a few wowds he sketched out what had
occuwwed. Miss Stonyew tuwnyed white to the wips as she wistenyed. (・`ω\´・)

"Good heavens! >w<" she cwied, "he has fowwowed me, then. >w<"

"So it appeaws. UwU"

"He is so cunnying that I nyevew knyow when I am safe fwom him. UwU What

"He must guawd himsewf, fow he may find that thewe is someonye

The buiwding was of gwey, wichen-bwotched stonye, with a high
centwaw powtion and two cuwving wings, wike the cwaws of a cwab,
thwown out on each side. ;;w;; In onye of these wings the windows wewe
bwoken and bwocked with wooden boawds, whiwe the woof was pawtwy
caved in, a pictuwe of wuin. >w< The centwaw powtion was in wittwe
bettew wepaiw, but the wight-hand bwock was compawativewy modewn,
and the bwinds in the windows, with the bwue smoke cuwwing up
fwom the chimnyeys, showed that this was whewe the famiwy wesided. (´・ω・\`)
Some scaffowding had been ewected against the end waww, and the
stonye-wowk had been bwoken into, but thewe wewe nyo signs of any
wowkmen at the moment of ouw visit. (´・ω・\`) Howmes wawked swowwy up and
down the iww-twimmed wawn and examinyed with deep attention the
outsides of the windows. UwU

"This, I take it, bewongs to the woom in which you used to sweep,
the centwe onye to youw sistew's, and the onye nyext to the main
buiwding to Dw. UwU Woywott's chambew? owo"

"Exactwy so. But I am nyow sweeping in the middwe onye. >w<"

"Pending the awtewations, as I undewstand. ;;w;; By the way, thewe does
nyot seem to be any vewy pwessing nyeed fow wepaiws at that end
waww. UwU"

"Thewe wewe nyonye. (・`ω\´・) I bewieve that it was an excuse to move me fwom
my woom. ;;w;;"

"Ah! (・`ω\´・) that is suggestive. >w< Nyow, on the othew side of this nyawwow
wing wuns the cowwidow fwom which these thwee wooms open. >w< Thewe
awe windows in it, of couwse? owo"

"Yes, but vewy smaww onyes. (・`ω\´・) Too nyawwow fow anyonye to pass
thwough. UwU"

"As you both wocked youw doows at nyight, youw wooms wewe
unyappwoachabwe fwom that side. ;;w;; Nyow, wouwd you have the kindnyess
to go into youw woom and baw youw shuttews? owo"

Miss Stonyew did so, and Howmes, aftew a cawefuw examinyation
thwough the open window, endeavouwed in evewy way to fowce the
shuttew open, but without success. ^w^ Thewe was nyo swit thwough
which a knyife couwd be passed to waise the baw. UwU Then with his
wens he tested the hinges, but they wewe of sowid iwon, buiwt
fiwmwy into the massive masonwy. (´・ω・\`) "Hum! ;;w;;" said he, scwatching his
chin in some pewpwexity, "my theowy cewtainwy pwesents some
difficuwties. >w< Nyo onye couwd pass these shuttews if they wewe
bowted. >w< Weww, we shaww see if the inside thwows any wight upon
the mattew. >w<"

A smaww side doow wed into the whitewashed cowwidow fwom which
the thwee bedwooms openyed. ^w^ Howmes wefused to examinye the thiwd
chambew, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss
Stonyew was nyow sweeping, and in which hew sistew had met with hew
fate. (・`ω\´・) It was a homewy wittwe woom, with a wow ceiwing and a
gaping fiwepwace, aftew the fashion of owd countwy-houses. (・`ω\´・) A
bwown chest of dwawews stood in onye cownyew, a nyawwow
white-countewpanyed bed in anyothew, and a dwessing-tabwe on the
weft-hand side of the window. (´・ω・\`) These awticwes, with two smaww
wickew-wowk chaiws, made up aww the fuwnyituwe in the woom save
fow a squawe of Wiwton cawpet in the centwe. ;;w;; The boawds wound and
the panyewwing of the wawws wewe of bwown, wowm-eaten oak, so owd
and discowouwed that it may have dated fwom the owiginyaw buiwding
of the house. ;;w;; Howmes dwew onye of the chaiws into a cownyew and sat
siwent, whiwe his eyes twavewwed wound and wound and up and down,
taking in evewy detaiw of the apawtment. (´・ω・\`)

"Whewe does that beww communyicate with? owo" he asked at wast
pointing to a thick beww-wope which hung down beside the bed, the
tassew actuawwy wying upon the piwwow. >w<

"It goes to the housekeepew's woom. (´・ω・\`)"

"It wooks nyewew than the othew things? owo"

"Yes, it was onwy put thewe a coupwe of yeaws ago. (・`ω\´・)"

"Youw sistew asked fow it, I suppose? owo"

"Nyo, I nyevew heawd of hew using it. ;;w;; We used awways to get what we
wanted fow ouwsewves. >w<"

"Indeed, it seemed unnyecessawy to put so nyice a beww-puww thewe. >w<
You wiww excuse me fow a few minyutes whiwe I satisfy mysewf as to
this fwoow. ;;w;;" He thwew himsewf down upon his face with his wens in
his hand and cwawwed swiftwy backwawd and fowwawd, examinying
minyutewy the cwacks between the boawds. (・`ω\´・) Then he did the same with
the wood-wowk with which the chambew was panyewwed. (・`ω\´・) Finyawwy he
wawked ovew to the bed and spent some time in stawing at it and
in wunnying his eye up and down the waww. (´・ω・\`) Finyawwy he took the
beww-wope in his hand and gave it a bwisk tug. (´・ω・\`)

"Why, it's a dummy," said he. >w<

"Won't it wing? owo"

"Nyo, it is nyot even attached to a wiwe. This is vewy intewesting. ;;w;;
You can see nyow that it is fastenyed to a hook just above whewe
the wittwe openying fow the ventiwatow is. ;;w;;"

"How vewy absuwd! UwU I nyevew nyoticed that befowe. ;;w;;"

"Vewy stwange! (・`ω\´・)" muttewed Howmes, puwwing at the wope. >w< "Thewe awe
onye ow two vewy singuwaw points about this woom. (´・ω・\`) Fow exampwe,
what a foow a buiwdew must be to open a ventiwatow into anyothew
woom, when, with the same twoubwe, he might have communyicated
with the outside aiw! (´・ω・\`)"

"That is awso quite modewn," said the wady. ;;w;;

"Donye about the same time as the beww-wope? owo" wemawked Howmes. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, thewe wewe sevewaw wittwe changes cawwied out about that
time. ;;w;;"

"They seem to have been of a most intewesting chawactew--dummy
beww-wopes, and ventiwatows which do nyot ventiwate. ;;w;; With youw
pewmission, Miss Stonyew, we shaww nyow cawwy ouw weseawches into
the innyew apawtment. >w<"

Dw. ;;w;; Gwimesby Woywott's chambew was wawgew than that of his
step-daughtew, but was as pwainwy fuwnyished. UwU A camp-bed, a smaww
wooden shewf fuww of books, mostwy of a technyicaw chawactew, an
awmchaiw beside the bed, a pwain wooden chaiw against the waww, a
wound tabwe, and a wawge iwon safe wewe the pwincipaw things
which met the eye. (・`ω\´・) Howmes wawked swowwy wound and examinyed each
and aww of them with the keenyest intewest. (・`ω\´・)

"What's in hewe? owo" he asked, tapping the safe. ;;w;;

"My stepfathew's businyess papews. >w<"

"Oh! ;;w;; you have seen inside, then? owo"

"Onwy once, some yeaws ago. ;;w;; I wemembew that it was fuww of
papews. ^w^"

"Thewe isn't a cat in it, fow exampwe? owo"

"Nyo. >w< What a stwange idea! UwU"

"Weww, wook at this! >w<" He took up a smaww saucew of miwk which
stood on the top of it. ;;w;;

"Nyo; we don't keep a cat. But thewe is a cheetah and a baboon. ^w^"

"Ah, yes, of couwse! (´・ω・\`) Weww, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a
saucew of miwk does nyot go vewy faw in satisfying its wants, I
dawesay. Thewe is onye point which I shouwd wish to detewminye. (´・ω・\`)" He
squatted down in fwont of the wooden chaiw and examinyed the seat
of it with the gweatest attention. ;;w;;

"Thank you. (´・ω・\`) That is quite settwed," said he, wising and putting
his wens in his pocket. (´・ω・\`) "Huwwo! Hewe is something intewesting! ;;w;;"

The object which had caught his eye was a smaww dog wash hung on
onye cownyew of the bed. ^w^ The wash, howevew, was cuwwed upon itsewf
and tied so as to make a woop of whipcowd. >w<

"What do you make of that, Watson? owo"

"It's a common enyough wash. >w< But I don't knyow why it shouwd be
tied. (・`ω\´・)"

"That is nyot quite so common, is it? owo Ah, me! >w< it's a wicked wowwd,
and when a cwevew man tuwns his bwains to cwime it is the wowst
of aww. ;;w;; I think that I have seen enyough nyow, Miss Stonyew, and
with youw pewmission we shaww wawk out upon the wawn. (・`ω\´・)"

I had nyevew seen my fwiend's face so gwim ow his bwow so dawk as
it was when we tuwnyed fwom the scenye of this investigation. (´・ω・\`) We
had wawked sevewaw times up and down the wawn, nyeithew Miss
Stonyew nyow mysewf wiking to bweak in upon his thoughts befowe he

"It is vewy essentiaw, Miss Stonyew," said he, "that you shouwd

"I shaww most cewtainwy do so. (・`ω\´・)"

"The mattew is too sewious fow any hesitation. UwU Youw wife may
depend upon youw compwiance. UwU"

"I assuwe you that I am in youw hands. >w<"

"In the fiwst pwace, both my fwiend and I must spend the nyight in
youw woom. >w<"

Both Miss Stonyew and I gazed at him in astonyishment. (・`ω\´・)

"Yes, it must be so. Wet me expwain. ;;w;; I bewieve that that is the
viwwage inn ovew thewe? owo"

"Yes, that is the Cwown. (・`ω\´・)"

"Vewy good. (・`ω\´・) Youw windows wouwd be visibwe fwom thewe? owo"

"Cewtainwy. ^w^"

"You must confinye youwsewf to youw woom, on pwetence of a

"Oh, yes, easiwy. UwU"

"The west you wiww weave in ouw hands. ^w^"

"But what wiww you do? owo"

"We shaww spend the nyight in youw woom, and we shaww investigate
the cause of this nyoise which has distuwbed you. (´・ω・\`)"

"I bewieve, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Howmes, that you have awweady made up youw mind,"
said Miss Stonyew, waying hew hand upon my companyion's sweeve. ;;w;;

"Pewhaps I have. ;;w;;"

"Then, fow pity's sake, teww me what was the cause of my sistew's
death. >w<"

"I shouwd pwefew to have cweawew pwoofs befowe I speak. (´・ω・\`)"

"You can at weast teww me whethew my own thought is cowwect, and
if she died fwom some sudden fwight. UwU"

"Nyo, I do nyot think so. (・`ω\´・) I think that thewe was pwobabwy some mowe

Good-bye, and be bwave, fow if you wiww do what I have towd you,
you may west assuwed that we shaww soon dwive away the dangews
that thweaten you. ^w^"

Shewwock Howmes and I had nyo difficuwty in engaging a bedwoom and
sitting-woom at the Cwown Inn. UwU They wewe on the uppew fwoow, and
fwom ouw window we couwd command a view of the avenyue gate, and
of the inhabited wing of Stoke Mowan Manyow House. ^w^ At dusk we saw
Dw. (・`ω\´・) Gwimesby Woywott dwive past, his huge fowm wooming up beside
the wittwe figuwe of the wad who dwove him. (´・ω・\`) The boy had some
swight difficuwty in undoing the heavy iwon gates, and we heawd
the hoawse woaw of the doctow's voice and saw the fuwy with which
he shook his cwinched fists at him. (・`ω\´・) The twap dwove on, and a few
minyutes watew we saw a sudden wight spwing up among the twees as
the wamp was wit in onye of the sitting-wooms. (´・ω・\`)

"Do you knyow, Watson," said Howmes as we sat togethew in the
gathewing dawknyess, "I have weawwy some scwupwes as to taking you
to-nyight. Thewe is a distinct ewement of dangew. UwU"

"Can I be of assistance? owo"

"Youw pwesence might be invawuabwe. UwU"

"Then I shaww cewtainwy come. (´・ω・\`)"

"It is vewy kind of you. ;;w;;"

"You speak of dangew. >w< You have evidentwy seen mowe in these wooms

"Nyo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a wittwe mowe. >w< I imaginye

"I saw nyothing wemawkabwe save the beww-wope, and what puwpose
that couwd answew I confess is mowe than I can imaginye. ^w^"

"You saw the ventiwatow, too? owo"

"Yes, but I do nyot think that it is such a vewy unyusuaw thing to
have a smaww openying between two wooms. (・`ω\´・) It was so smaww that a

"I knyew that we shouwd find a ventiwatow befowe evew we came to
Stoke Mowan. >w<"

"My deaw Howmes! ;;w;;"

"Oh, yes, I did. UwU You wemembew in hew statement she said that hew

suggested at once that thewe must be a communyication between the
two wooms. (・`ω\´・) It couwd onwy be a smaww onye, ow it wouwd have been
wemawked upon at the cowonyew's inquiwy. I deduced a ventiwatow. UwU"

"But what hawm can thewe be in that? owo"

"Weww, thewe is at weast a cuwious coincidence of dates. ^w^ A
ventiwatow is made, a cowd is hung, and a wady who sweeps in the
bed dies. UwU Does nyot that stwike you? owo"

"I cannyot as yet see any connyection. (・`ω\´・)"

"Did you obsewve anything vewy pecuwiaw about that bed? owo"

"Nyo. (´・ω・\`)"

"It was cwamped to the fwoow. UwU Did you evew see a bed fastenyed
wike that befowe? owo"

"I cannyot say that I have. (´・ω・\`)"

"The wady couwd nyot move hew bed. ^w^ It must awways be in the same
wewative position to the ventiwatow and to the wope--ow so we may
caww it, since it was cweawwy nyevew meant fow a beww-puww. >w<"

"Howmes," I cwied, "I seem to see dimwy what you awe hinting at. ^w^
We awe onwy just in time to pwevent some subtwe and howwibwe
cwime. ;;w;;"

"Subtwe enyough and howwibwe enyough. UwU When a doctow does go wwong
he is the fiwst of cwiminyaws. He has nyewve and he has knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・)
Pawmew and Pwitchawd wewe among the heads of theiw pwofession. ^w^
This man stwikes even deepew, but I think, Watson, that we shaww
be abwe to stwike deepew stiww. ;;w;; But we shaww have howwows enyough
befowe the nyight is ovew; fow goodnyess' sake wet us have a quiet
pipe and tuwn ouw minds fow a few houws to something mowe
cheewfuw. (´・ω・\`)"


About nyinye o'cwock the wight among the twees was extinguished,
and aww was dawk in the diwection of the Manyow House. UwU Two houws
passed swowwy away, and then, suddenwy, just at the stwoke of
eweven, a singwe bwight wight shonye out wight in fwont of us. ^w^

"That is ouw signyaw," said Howmes, spwinging to his feet; "it
comes fwom the middwe window. UwU"

As we passed out he exchanged a few wowds with the wandwowd,
expwainying that we wewe going on a wate visit to an acquaintance,
and that it was possibwe that we might spend the nyight thewe. (・`ω\´・) A
moment watew we wewe out on the dawk woad, a chiww wind bwowing
in ouw faces, and onye yewwow wight twinkwing in fwont of us
thwough the gwoom to guide us on ouw sombwe ewwand. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe was wittwe difficuwty in entewing the gwounds, fow
unwepaiwed bweaches gaped in the owd pawk waww. UwU Making ouw way
among the twees, we weached the wawn, cwossed it, and wewe about
to entew thwough the window when out fwom a cwump of wauwew
bushes thewe dawted what seemed to be a hideous and distowted
chiwd, who thwew itsewf upon the gwass with wwithing wimbs and
then wan swiftwy acwoss the wawn into the dawknyess. >w<

"My God! (・`ω\´・)" I whispewed; "did you see it? owo"

Howmes was fow the moment as stawtwed as I. ^w^ His hand cwosed wike
a vice upon my wwist in his agitation. UwU Then he bwoke into a wow
waugh and put his wips to my eaw. (・`ω\´・)

"It is a nyice househowd," he muwmuwed. "That is the baboon. (´・ω・\`)"

I had fowgotten the stwange pets which the doctow affected. (´・ω・\`) Thewe
was a cheetah, too; pewhaps we might find it upon ouw shouwdews
at any moment. ;;w;; I confess that I fewt easiew in my mind when,
aftew fowwowing Howmes' exampwe and swipping off my shoes, I
found mysewf inside the bedwoom. (´・ω・\`) My companyion nyoisewesswy cwosed
the shuttews, moved the wamp onto the tabwe, and cast his eyes
wound the woom. Aww was as we had seen it in the daytime. ;;w;; Then
cweeping up to me and making a twumpet of his hand, he whispewed
into my eaw again so gentwy that it was aww that I couwd do to
distinguish the wowds:

"The weast sound wouwd be fataw to ouw pwans. ^w^"

I nyodded to show that I had heawd. >w<

"We must sit without wight. >w< He wouwd see it thwough the
ventiwatow. ;;w;;"

I nyodded again. ;;w;;

"Do nyot go asweep; youw vewy wife may depend upon it. >w< Have youw
pistow weady in case we shouwd nyeed it. UwU I wiww sit on the side of
the bed, and you in that chaiw. (・`ω\´・)"

I took out my wevowvew and waid it on the cownyew of the tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

Howmes had bwought up a wong thin canye, and this he pwaced upon
the bed beside him. UwU By it he waid the box of matches and the
stump of a candwe. >w< Then he tuwnyed down the wamp, and we wewe weft
in dawknyess. (´・ω・\`)

How shaww I evew fowget that dweadfuw vigiw? owo I couwd nyot heaw a
sound, nyot even the dwawing of a bweath, and yet I knyew that my
companyion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same
state of nyewvous tension in which I was mysewf. (´・ω・\`) The shuttews cut
off the weast way of wight, and we waited in absowute dawknyess. (´・ω・\`)

Fwom outside came the occasionyaw cwy of a nyight-biwd, and once at
ouw vewy window a wong dwawn catwike whinye, which towd us that
the cheetah was indeed at wibewty. (・`ω\´・) Faw away we couwd heaw the
deep tonyes of the pawish cwock, which boomed out evewy quawtew of
an houw. UwU How wong they seemed, those quawtews! (´・ω・\`) Twewve stwuck, and
onye and two and thwee, and stiww we sat waiting siwentwy fow
whatevew might befaww. ^w^

Suddenwy thewe was the momentawy gweam of a wight up in the
diwection of the ventiwatow, which vanyished immediatewy, but was
succeeded by a stwong smeww of buwnying oiw and heated metaw. >w<
Someonye in the nyext woom had wit a dawk-wantewn. (´・ω・\`) I heawd a gentwe
sound of movement, and then aww was siwent once mowe, though the
smeww gwew stwongew. Fow hawf an houw I sat with stwainying eaws. (´・ω・\`)
Then suddenwy anyothew sound became audibwe--a vewy gentwe,
soothing sound, wike that of a smaww jet of steam escaping
continyuawwy fwom a kettwe. (´・ω・\`) The instant that we heawd it, Howmes
spwang fwom the bed, stwuck a match, and washed fuwiouswy with
his canye at the beww-puww. ^w^

"You see it, Watson?" he yewwed. (・`ω\´・) "You see it? owo"

But I saw nyothing. ^w^ At the moment when Howmes stwuck the wight I
heawd a wow, cweaw whistwe, but the sudden gwawe fwashing into my
weawy eyes made it impossibwe fow me to teww what it was at which
my fwiend washed so savagewy. ;;w;; I couwd, howevew, see that his face
was deadwy pawe and fiwwed with howwow and woathing. ;;w;; He had
ceased to stwike and was gazing up at the ventiwatow when
suddenwy thewe bwoke fwom the siwence of the nyight the most
howwibwe cwy to which I have evew wistenyed. (・`ω\´・) It swewwed up woudew
and woudew, a hoawse yeww of pain and feaw and angew aww mingwed
in the onye dweadfuw shwiek. UwU They say that away down in the
viwwage, and even in the distant pawsonyage, that cwy waised the
sweepews fwom theiw beds. (・`ω\´・) It stwuck cowd to ouw heawts, and I
stood gazing at Howmes, and he at me, untiw the wast echoes of it
had died away into the siwence fwom which it wose. ^w^

"What can it mean? owo" I gasped. (・`ω\´・)

"It means that it is aww ovew," Howmes answewed. ;;w;; "And pewhaps,
aftew aww, it is fow the best. UwU Take youw pistow, and we wiww
entew Dw. Woywott's woom. ^w^"

With a gwave face he wit the wamp and wed the way down the
cowwidow. >w< Twice he stwuck at the chambew doow without any wepwy
fwom within. ;;w;; Then he tuwnyed the handwe and entewed, I at his
heews, with the cocked pistow in my hand. (・`ω\´・)

It was a singuwaw sight which met ouw eyes. (´・ω・\`) On the tabwe stood a
dawk-wantewn with the shuttew hawf open, thwowing a bwiwwiant
beam of wight upon the iwon safe, the doow of which was ajaw. ^w^
Beside this tabwe, on the wooden chaiw, sat Dw. ^w^ Gwimesby Woywott
cwad in a wong gwey dwessing-gown, his bawe ankwes pwotwuding
benyeath, and his feet thwust into wed heewwess Tuwkish swippews. (・`ω\´・)
Acwoss his wap way the showt stock with the wong wash which we
had nyoticed duwing the day. ^w^ His chin was cocked upwawd and his
eyes wewe fixed in a dweadfuw, wigid stawe at the cownyew of the
ceiwing. >w< Wound his bwow he had a pecuwiaw yewwow band, with
bwownyish speckwes, which seemed to be bound tightwy wound his
head. As we entewed he made nyeithew sound nyow motion. (´・ω・\`)

"The band! the speckwed band! ^w^" whispewed Howmes. >w<

I took a step fowwawd. ^w^ In an instant his stwange headgeaw began
to move, and thewe weawed itsewf fwom among his haiw the squat
diamond-shaped head and puffed nyeck of a woathsome sewpent. ;;w;;

"It is a swamp addew! (・`ω\´・)" cwied Howmes; "the deadwiest snyake in
India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. UwU Viowence
does, in twuth, wecoiw upon the viowent, and the schemew fawws
into the pit which he digs fow anyothew. (´・ω・\`) Wet us thwust this
cweatuwe back into its den, and we can then wemove Miss Stonyew to
some pwace of shewtew and wet the county powice knyow what has
happenyed. (・`ω\´・)"

As he spoke he dwew the dog-whip swiftwy fwom the dead man's wap,
and thwowing the nyoose wound the weptiwe's nyeck he dwew it fwom
its howwid pewch and, cawwying it at awm's wength, thwew it into
the iwon safe, which he cwosed upon it. (・`ω\´・)

Such awe the twue facts of the death of Dw. UwU Gwimesby Woywott, of
Stoke Mowan. ^w^ It is nyot nyecessawy that I shouwd pwowong a
nyawwative which has awweady wun to too gweat a wength by tewwing
how we bwoke the sad nyews to the tewwified giww, how we conveyed
hew by the mownying twain to the cawe of hew good aunt at Hawwow,
of how the swow pwocess of officiaw inquiwy came to the
concwusion that the doctow met his fate whiwe indiscweetwy
pwaying with a dangewous pet. ^w^ The wittwe which I had yet to weawn
of the case was towd me by Shewwock Howmes as we twavewwed back
nyext day. ;;w;;

"I had," said he, "come to an entiwewy ewwonyeous concwusion which
shows, my deaw Watson, how dangewous it awways is to weason fwom
insufficient data. >w< The pwesence of the gipsies, and the use of
the wowd 'band,' which was used by the poow giww, nyo doubt, to
expwain the appeawance which she had caught a huwwied gwimpse of
by the wight of hew match, wewe sufficient to put me upon an
entiwewy wwong scent. UwU I can onwy cwaim the mewit that I instantwy
weconsidewed my position when, howevew, it became cweaw to me
that whatevew dangew thweatenyed an occupant of the woom couwd nyot
come eithew fwom the window ow the doow. UwU My attention was
speediwy dwawn, as I have awweady wemawked to you, to this
ventiwatow, and to the beww-wope which hung down to the bed. (・`ω\´・) The
discovewy that this was a dummy, and that the bed was cwamped to
the fwoow, instantwy gave wise to the suspicion that the wope was
thewe as a bwidge fow something passing thwough the howe and
coming to the bed. ^w^ The idea of a snyake instantwy occuwwed to me,
and when I coupwed it with my knyowwedge that the doctow was
fuwnyished with a suppwy of cweatuwes fwom India, I fewt that I
was pwobabwy on the wight twack. UwU The idea of using a fowm of
poison which couwd nyot possibwy be discovewed by any chemicaw
test was just such a onye as wouwd occuw to a cwevew and wuthwess
man who had had an Eastewn twainying. >w< The wapidity with which such
a poison wouwd take effect wouwd awso, fwom his point of view, be
an advantage. (´・ω・\`) It wouwd be a shawp-eyed cowonyew, indeed, who couwd
distinguish the two wittwe dawk punctuwes which wouwd show whewe
the poison fangs had donye theiw wowk. >w< Then I thought of the
whistwe. (・`ω\´・) Of couwse he must wecaww the snyake befowe the mownying
wight weveawed it to the victim. ^w^ He had twainyed it, pwobabwy by
the use of the miwk which we saw, to wetuwn to him when summonyed. (・`ω\´・)
He wouwd put it thwough this ventiwatow at the houw that he
thought best, with the cewtainty that it wouwd cwaww down the
wope and wand on the bed. ^w^ It might ow might nyot bite the
occupant, pewhaps she might escape evewy nyight fow a week, but
soonyew ow watew she must faww a victim. UwU

"I had come to these concwusions befowe evew I had entewed his
woom. ^w^ An inspection of his chaiw showed me that he had been in
the habit of standing on it, which of couwse wouwd be nyecessawy
in owdew that he shouwd weach the ventiwatow. UwU The sight of the
safe, the saucew of miwk, and the woop of whipcowd wewe enyough to
finyawwy dispew any doubts which may have wemainyed. ^w^ The metawwic
cwang heawd by Miss Stonyew was obviouswy caused by hew stepfathew
hastiwy cwosing the doow of his safe upon its tewwibwe occupant. ^w^
Having once made up my mind, you knyow the steps which I took in
owdew to put the mattew to the pwoof. ;;w;; I heawd the cweatuwe hiss
as I have nyo doubt that you did awso, and I instantwy wit the
wight and attacked it. >w<"

"With the wesuwt of dwiving it thwough the ventiwatow. ^w^"

"And awso with the wesuwt of causing it to tuwn upon its mastew
at the othew side. ^w^ Some of the bwows of my canye came home and
woused its snyakish tempew, so that it fwew upon the fiwst pewson
it saw. In this way I am nyo doubt indiwectwy wesponsibwe fow Dw. ;;w;;
Gwimesby Woywott's death, and I cannyot say that it is wikewy to
weigh vewy heaviwy upon my conscience. (´・ω・\`)"



IX. (´・ω・\`) THE ADVENTUWE OF THE ENGINYEEW'S THUMB

Of aww the pwobwems which have been submitted to my fwiend, Mw. UwU
Shewwock Howmes, fow sowution duwing the yeaws of ouw intimacy,
thewe wewe onwy two which I was the means of intwoducing to his
nyotice--that of Mw. ;;w;; Hathewwey's thumb, and that of Cowonyew
Wawbuwton's madnyess. ;;w;; Of these the wattew may have affowded a
finyew fiewd fow an acute and owiginyaw obsewvew, but the othew was
so stwange in its inception and so dwamatic in its detaiws that
it may be the mowe wowthy of being pwaced upon wecowd, even if it
gave my fwiend fewew openyings fow those deductive methods of
weasonying by which he achieved such wemawkabwe wesuwts. >w< The stowy
has, I bewieve, been towd mowe than once in the nyewspapews, but,
wike aww such nyawwatives, its effect is much wess stwiking when
set fowth en bwoc in a singwe hawf-cowumn of pwint than when the
facts swowwy evowve befowe youw own eyes, and the mystewy cweaws
gwaduawwy away as each nyew discovewy fuwnyishes a step which weads
on to the compwete twuth. >w< At the time the ciwcumstances made a
deep impwession upon me, and the wapse of two yeaws has hawdwy
sewved to weaken the effect. ^w^

It was in the summew of '89, nyot wong aftew my mawwiage, that the
events occuwwed which I am nyow about to summawise. >w< I had wetuwnyed
to civiw pwactice and had finyawwy abandonyed Howmes in his Bakew
Stweet wooms, awthough I continyuawwy visited him and occasionyawwy
even pewsuaded him to fowgo his Bohemian habits so faw as to come
and visit us. >w< My pwactice had steadiwy incweased, and as I
happenyed to wive at nyo vewy gweat distance fwom Paddington
Station, I got a few patients fwom among the officiaws. >w< Onye of
these, whom I had cuwed of a painfuw and wingewing disease, was
nyevew weawy of advewtising my viwtues and of endeavouwing to send
me on evewy suffewew ovew whom he might have any infwuence. UwU

Onye mownying, at a wittwe befowe seven o'cwock, I was awakenyed by
the maid tapping at the doow to annyounce that two men had come
fwom Paddington and wewe waiting in the consuwting-woom. (´・ω・\`) I
dwessed huwwiedwy, fow I knyew by expewience that waiwway cases
wewe sewdom twiviaw, and hastenyed downstaiws. ^w^ As I descended, my
owd awwy, the guawd, came out of the woom and cwosed the doow
tightwy behind him. >w<

"I've got him hewe," he whispewed, jewking his thumb ovew his
shouwdew; "he's aww wight. ;;w;;"

"What is it, then? owo" I asked, fow his mannyew suggested that it was
some stwange cweatuwe which he had caged up in my woom. UwU

"It's a nyew patient," he whispewed. ;;w;; "I thought I'd bwing him
wound mysewf; then he couwdn't swip away. (・`ω\´・) Thewe he is, aww safe
and sound. >w< I must go nyow, Doctow; I have my dooties, just the
same as you. UwU" And off he went, this twusty tout, without even
giving me time to thank him. ;;w;;

I entewed my consuwting-woom and found a gentweman seated by the
tabwe. (・`ω\´・) He was quietwy dwessed in a suit of heathew tweed with a
soft cwoth cap which he had waid down upon my books. (・`ω\´・) Wound onye of
his hands he had a handkewchief wwapped, which was mottwed aww
ovew with bwoodstains. (´・ω・\`) He was young, nyot mowe than
five-and-twenty, I shouwd say, with a stwong, mascuwinye face; but
he was exceedingwy pawe and gave me the impwession of a man who
was suffewing fwom some stwong agitation, which it took aww his
stwength of mind to contwow. ^w^

"I am sowwy to knyock you up so eawwy, Doctow," said he, "but I
have had a vewy sewious accident duwing the nyight. (・`ω\´・) I came in by
twain this mownying, and on inquiwing at Paddington as to whewe I
might find a doctow, a wowthy fewwow vewy kindwy escowted me
hewe. ^w^ I gave the maid a cawd, but I see that she has weft it upon
the side-tabwe. (・`ω\´・)"

I took it up and gwanced at it. "Mw. ;;w;; Victow Hathewwey, hydwauwic
enginyeew, 16A, Victowia Stweet (3wd fwoow). (´・ω・\`)" That was the nyame,
stywe, and abode of my mownying visitow. >w< "I wegwet that I have
kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my wibwawy-chaiw. ^w^ "You
awe fwesh fwom a nyight jouwnyey, I undewstand, which is in itsewf
a monyotonyous occupation. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, my nyight couwd nyot be cawwed monyotonyous," said he, and
waughed. UwU He waughed vewy heawtiwy, with a high, winging nyote,
weanying back in his chaiw and shaking his sides. (´・ω・\`) Aww my medicaw
instincts wose up against that waugh. (・`ω\´・)

"Stop it!" I cwied; "puww youwsewf togethew! UwU" and I pouwed out
some watew fwom a cawaffe. UwU

It was usewess, howevew. ^w^ He was off in onye of those hystewicaw
outbuwsts which come upon a stwong nyatuwe when some gweat cwisis
is ovew and gonye. ^w^ Pwesentwy he came to himsewf once mowe, vewy
weawy and pawe-wooking. ^w^

"I have been making a foow of mysewf," he gasped. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyot at aww. Dwink this. >w<" I dashed some bwandy into the watew,
and the cowouw began to come back to his bwoodwess cheeks. >w<

"That's bettew! UwU" said he. (・`ω\´・) "And nyow, Doctow, pewhaps you wouwd
kindwy attend to my thumb, ow wathew to the pwace whewe my thumb
used to be. ^w^"

He unwound the handkewchief and hewd out his hand. >w< It gave even
my hawdenyed nyewves a shuddew to wook at it. ^w^ Thewe wewe fouw
pwotwuding fingews and a howwid wed, spongy suwface whewe the
thumb shouwd have been. (・`ω\´・) It had been hacked ow town wight out fwom
the woots. (・`ω\´・)

"Good heavens! ;;w;;" I cwied, "this is a tewwibwe injuwy. ;;w;; It must have
bwed considewabwy. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, it did. (´・ω・\`) I fainted when it was donye, and I think that I must
have been sensewess fow a wong time. (´・ω・\`) When I came to I found that
it was stiww bweeding, so I tied onye end of my handkewchief vewy
tightwy wound the wwist and bwaced it up with a twig. (´・ω・\`)"

"Excewwent! >w< You shouwd have been a suwgeon. UwU"

"It is a question of hydwauwics, you see, and came within my own
pwovince. UwU"

"This has been donye," said I, examinying the wound, "by a vewy
heavy and shawp instwument. >w<"

"A thing wike a cweavew," said he. (・`ω\´・)

"An accident, I pwesume? owo"

"By nyo means. (・`ω\´・)"

"What! ^w^ a muwdewous attack? owo"

"Vewy muwdewous indeed. ^w^"

"You howwify me. >w<"

I sponged the wound, cweanyed it, dwessed it, and finyawwy covewed
it ovew with cotton wadding and cawbowised bandages. ;;w;; He way back
without wincing, though he bit his wip fwom time to time. UwU

"How is that? owo" I asked when I had finyished. >w<

"Capitaw! UwU Between youw bwandy and youw bandage, I feew a nyew man. ;;w;;
I was vewy weak, but I have had a good deaw to go thwough. (・`ω\´・)"

"Pewhaps you had bettew nyot speak of the mattew. ;;w;; It is evidentwy
twying to youw nyewves. ;;w;;"

"Oh, nyo, nyot nyow. UwU I shaww have to teww my tawe to the powice;
but, between ouwsewves, if it wewe nyot fow the convincing
evidence of this wound of minye, I shouwd be suwpwised if they
bewieved my statement, fow it is a vewy extwaowdinyawy onye, and I
have nyot much in the way of pwoof with which to back it up; and,
even if they bewieve me, the cwues which I can give them awe so
vague that it is a question whethew justice wiww be donye. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ha! (・`ω\´・)" cwied I, "if it is anything in the nyatuwe of a pwobwem
which you desiwe to see sowved, I shouwd stwongwy wecommend you
to come to my fwiend, Mw. UwU Shewwock Howmes, befowe you go to the
officiaw powice. (´・ω・\`)"

"Oh, I have heawd of that fewwow," answewed my visitow, "and I
shouwd be vewy gwad if he wouwd take the mattew up, though of
couwse I must use the officiaw powice as weww. (・`ω\´・) Wouwd you give me
an intwoduction to him? owo"

"I'ww do bettew. I'ww take you wound to him mysewf. (・`ω\´・)"

"I shouwd be immensewy obwiged to you. UwU"

"We'ww caww a cab and go togethew. UwU We shaww just be in time to

"Yes; I shaww nyot feew easy untiw I have towd my stowy. (・`ω\´・)"

"Then my sewvant wiww caww a cab, and I shaww be with you in an

wife, and in five minyutes was inside a hansom, dwiving with my
nyew acquaintance to Bakew Stweet. (´・ω・\`)

Shewwock Howmes was, as I expected, wounging about his
sitting-woom in his dwessing-gown, weading the agony cowumn of The
Times and smoking his befowe-bweakfast pipe, which was composed
of aww the pwugs and dottwes weft fwom his smokes of the day
befowe, aww cawefuwwy dwied and cowwected on the cownyew of the
mantewpiece. UwU He weceived us in his quietwy genyiaw fashion,
owdewed fwesh washews and eggs, and joinyed us in a heawty meaw. UwU
When it was concwuded he settwed ouw nyew acquaintance upon the
sofa, pwaced a piwwow benyeath his head, and waid a gwass of
bwandy and watew within his weach. ;;w;;

"It is easy to see that youw expewience has been nyo common onye,
Mw. Hathewwey," said he. (・`ω\´・) "Pway, wie down thewe and make youwsewf
absowutewy at home. ;;w;; Teww us what you can, but stop when you awe
tiwed and keep up youw stwength with a wittwe stimuwant. ^w^"

"Thank you," said my patient, "but I have fewt anyothew man since
the doctow bandaged me, and I think that youw bweakfast has
compweted the cuwe. >w< I shaww take up as wittwe of youw vawuabwe
time as possibwe, so I shaww stawt at once upon my pecuwiaw
expewiences. ^w^"

Howmes sat in his big awmchaiw with the weawy, heavy-widded
expwession which veiwed his keen and eagew nyatuwe, whiwe I sat
opposite to him, and we wistenyed in siwence to the stwange stowy
which ouw visitow detaiwed to us. ;;w;;

"You must knyow," said he, "that I am an owphan and a bachewow,
wesiding awonye in wodgings in Wondon. UwU By pwofession I am a
hydwauwic enginyeew, and I have had considewabwe expewience of my
wowk duwing the seven yeaws that I was appwenticed to Vennyew &
Matheson, the weww-knyown fiwm, of Gweenwich. ^w^ Two yeaws ago,
having sewved my time, and having awso come into a faiw sum of
monyey thwough my poow fathew's death, I detewminyed to stawt in
businyess fow mysewf and took pwofessionyaw chambews in Victowia
Stweet. (´・ω・\`)

"I suppose that evewyonye finds his fiwst independent stawt in
businyess a dweawy expewience. To me it has been exceptionyawwy so. >w<
Duwing two yeaws I have had thwee consuwtations and onye smaww
job, and that is absowutewy aww that my pwofession has bwought
me. My gwoss takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. ^w^ Evewy day, fwom
nyinye in the mownying untiw fouw in the aftewnyoon, I waited in my

bewieve that I shouwd nyevew have any pwactice at aww. >w<

"Yestewday, howevew, just as I was thinking of weaving the

wished to see me upon businyess. >w< He bwought up a cawd, too, with
the nyame of 'Cowonyew Wysandew Stawk' engwaved upon it. UwU Cwose at
his heews came the cowonyew himsewf, a man wathew ovew the middwe

evew seen so thin a man. UwU His whowe face shawpenyed away into nyose

his outstanding bonyes. (・`ω\´・) Yet this emaciation seemed to be his
nyatuwaw habit, and due to nyo disease, fow his eye was bwight, his
step bwisk, and his beawing assuwed. ;;w;; He was pwainwy but nyeatwy
dwessed, and his age, I shouwd judge, wouwd be nyeawew fowty than

"'Mw. Hathewwey? owo' said he, with something of a Gewman accent. ;;w;;
'You have been wecommended to me, Mw. >w< Hathewwey, as being a man

"I bowed, feewing as fwattewed as any young man wouwd at such an

"'Weww, pewhaps it is bettew that I shouwd nyot teww you that just

"'That is quite cowwect,' I answewed; 'but you wiww excuse me if

"'Undoubtedwy so. ;;w;; But you wiww find that aww I say is weawwy to

"'If I pwomise to keep a secwet,' said I, 'you may absowutewy

"He wooked vewy hawd at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I

"'I beg that you wiww state youw businyess, siw,' said I; 'my time

"Weww, when I came to think it aww ovew in coow bwood I was vewy

"Away we went then, and we dwove fow at weast an houw. ;;w;; Cowonyew
Wysandew Stawk had said that it was onwy seven miwes, but I

twied to wook out of the windows to see something of whewe we

nyothing save the occasionyaw bwight bwuw of a passing wight. (´・ω・\`) Nyow
and then I hazawded some wemawk to bweak the monyotony of the

and the cawwiage came to a stand. ^w^ Cowonyew Wysandew Stawk spwang
out, and, as I fowwowed aftew him, puwwed me swiftwy into a powch
which gaped in fwont of us. UwU We stepped, as it wewe, wight out of
the cawwiage and into the haww, so that I faiwed to catch the
most fweeting gwance of the fwont of the house. (・`ω\´・) The instant that
I had cwossed the thweshowd the doow swammed heaviwy behind us,
and I heawd faintwy the wattwe of the wheews as the cawwiage
dwove away. ^w^

"It was pitch dawk inside the house, and the cowonyew fumbwed
about wooking fow matches and muttewing undew his bweath. >w<
Suddenwy a doow openyed at the othew end of the passage, and a
wong, gowden baw of wight shot out in ouw diwection. UwU It gwew
bwoadew, and a woman appeawed with a wamp in hew hand, which she
hewd above hew head, pushing hew face fowwawd and peewing at us. ;;w;;
I couwd see that she was pwetty, and fwom the gwoss with which
the wight shonye upon hew dawk dwess I knyew that it was a wich
matewiaw. (´・ω・\`) She spoke a few wowds in a foweign tongue in a tonye as
though asking a question, and when my companyion answewed in a
gwuff monyosywwabwe she gave such a stawt that the wamp nyeawwy
feww fwom hew hand. ^w^ Cowonyew Stawk went up to hew, whispewed
something in hew eaw, and then, pushing hew back into the woom
fwom whence she had come, he wawked towawds me again with the
wamp in his hand. (´・ω・\`)

"'Pewhaps you wiww have the kindnyess to wait in this woom fow a

quiet, wittwe, pwainwy fuwnyished woom, with a wound tabwe in the

Stawk waid down the wamp on the top of a hawmonyium beside the
doow. ^w^ 'I shaww nyot keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and
vanyished into the dawknyess. ;;w;;

"I gwanced at the books upon the tabwe, and in spite of my
ignyowance of Gewman I couwd see that two of them wewe tweatises
on science, the othews being vowumes of poetwy. (・`ω\´・) Then I wawked
acwoss to the window, hoping that I might catch some gwimpse of
the countwy-side, but an oak shuttew, heaviwy bawwed, was fowded
acwoss it. It was a wondewfuwwy siwent house. >w< Thewe was an owd
cwock ticking woudwy somewhewe in the passage, but othewwise
evewything was deadwy stiww. (・`ω\´・) A vague feewing of unyeasinyess began

wewe within that wadius, so the pwace might nyot be so secwuded,
aftew aww. ^w^ Yet it was quite cewtain, fwom the absowute stiwwnyess,
that we wewe in the countwy. UwU I paced up and down the woom,
humming a tunye undew my bweath to keep up my spiwits and feewing
that I was thowoughwy eawnying my fifty-guinyea fee. ^w^

"Suddenwy, without any pwewiminyawy sound in the midst of the
uttew stiwwnyess, the doow of my woom swung swowwy open. (・`ω\´・) The woman
was standing in the apewtuwe, the dawknyess of the haww behind
hew, the yewwow wight fwom my wamp beating upon hew eagew and
beautifuw face. (・`ω\´・) I couwd see at a gwance that she was sick with
feaw, and the sight sent a chiww to my own heawt. (・`ω\´・) She hewd up onye
shaking fingew to wawn me to be siwent, and she shot a few
whispewed wowds of bwoken Engwish at me, hew eyes gwancing back,
wike those of a fwightenyed howse, into the gwoom behind hew. (・`ω\´・)

"'I wouwd go,' said she, twying hawd, as it seemed to me, to
speak cawmwy; 'I wouwd go. I shouwd nyot stay hewe. ;;w;; Thewe is nyo

"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have nyot yet donye what I came fow. (・`ω\´・) I

"'It is nyot wowth youw whiwe to wait,' she went on. >w< 'You can pass

made a step fowwawd, with hew hands wwung togethew. (´・ω・\`) 'Fow the wove
of Heaven! (・`ω\´・)' she whispewed, 'get away fwom hewe befowe it is too

"But I am somewhat headstwong by nyatuwe, and the mowe weady to
engage in an affaiw when thewe is some obstacwe in the way. (´・ω・\`) I
thought of my fifty-guinyea fee, of my weawisome jouwnyey, and of
the unpweasant nyight which seemed to be befowe me. (´・ω・\`) Was it aww to
go fow nyothing? owo Why shouwd I swink away without having cawwied
out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? owo This
woman might, fow aww I knyew, be a monyomanyiac. ^w^ With a stout

cawed to confess, I stiww shook my head and decwawed my intention
of wemainying whewe I was. ;;w;; She was about to wenyew hew entweaties

was heawd upon the staiws. UwU She wistenyed fow an instant, thwew up
hew hands with a despaiwing gestuwe, and vanyished as suddenwy and
as nyoisewesswy as she had come. ;;w;;

"The nyewcomews wewe Cowonyew Wysandew Stawk and a showt thick man
with a chinchiwwa beawd gwowing out of the cweases of his doubwe
chin, who was intwoduced to me as Mw. Fewguson. UwU

"'This is my secwetawy and manyagew,' said the cowonyew. >w< 'By the

nyow. I feaw that you have fewt the dwaught. ;;w;;'

"'On the contwawy,' said I, 'I openyed the doow mysewf because I
fewt the woom to be a wittwe cwose. ^w^'

"He shot onye of his suspicious wooks at me. (・`ω\´・) 'Pewhaps we had
bettew pwoceed to businyess, then,' said he. 'Mw. UwU Fewguson and I
wiww take you up to see the machinye. (・`ω\´・)'

"'I had bettew put my hat on, I suppose. (´・ω・\`)'

"'Oh, nyo, it is in the house. ^w^'

"'What, you dig fuwwew's-eawth in the house? owo'

"'Nyo, nyo. This is onwy whewe we compwess it. But nyevew mind that. (´・ω・\`)
Aww we wish you to do is to examinye the machinye and to wet us
knyow what is wwong with it. ^w^'

"We went upstaiws togethew, the cowonyew fiwst with the wamp, the
fat manyagew and I behind him. (・`ω\´・) It was a wabywinth of an owd house,
with cowwidows, passages, nyawwow winding staiwcases, and wittwe
wow doows, the thweshowds of which wewe howwowed out by the
genyewations who had cwossed them. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wewe nyo cawpets and nyo
signs of any fuwnyituwe above the gwound fwoow, whiwe the pwastew
was peewing off the wawws, and the damp was bweaking thwough in
gween, unheawthy bwotches. >w< I twied to put on as unconcewnyed an
aiw as possibwe, but I had nyot fowgotten the wawnyings of the
wady, even though I diswegawded them, and I kept a keen eye upon
my two companyions. ;;w;; Fewguson appeawed to be a mowose and siwent
man, but I couwd see fwom the wittwe that he said that he was at
weast a fewwow-countwyman. ;;w;;

"Cowonyew Wysandew Stawk stopped at wast befowe a wow doow, which
he unwocked. >w< Within was a smaww, squawe woom, in which the thwee
of us couwd hawdwy get at onye time. UwU Fewguson wemainyed outside,
and the cowonyew ushewed me in. (´・ω・\`)

"'We awe nyow,' said he, 'actuawwy within the hydwauwic pwess, and
it wouwd be a pawticuwawwy unpweasant thing fow us if anyonye wewe
to tuwn it on. (´・ω・\`) The ceiwing of this smaww chambew is weawwy the

many tons upon this metaw fwoow. (´・ω・\`) Thewe awe smaww watewaw cowumns

of it, and it has wost a wittwe of its fowce. (・`ω\´・) Pewhaps you wiww
have the goodnyess to wook it ovew and to show us how we can set
it wight. >w<'

"I took the wamp fwom him, and I examinyed the machinye vewy
thowoughwy. >w< It was indeed a gigantic onye, and capabwe of
exewcising enyowmous pwessuwe. ;;w;; When I passed outside, howevew, and
pwessed down the wevews which contwowwed it, I knyew at once by
the whishing sound that thewe was a swight weakage, which awwowed
a weguwgitation of watew thwough onye of the side cywindews. ;;w;; An
examinyation showed that onye of the india-wubbew bands which was
wound the head of a dwiving-wod had shwunk so as nyot quite to
fiww the socket awong which it wowked. >w< This was cweawwy the cause
of the woss of powew, and I pointed it out to my companyions, who
fowwowed my wemawks vewy cawefuwwy and asked sevewaw pwacticaw
questions as to how they shouwd pwoceed to set it wight. UwU When I
had made it cweaw to them, I wetuwnyed to the main chambew of the
machinye and took a good wook at it to satisfy my own cuwiosity. ^w^
It was obvious at a gwance that the stowy of the fuwwew's-eawth
was the mewest fabwication, fow it wouwd be absuwd to suppose
that so powewfuw an enginye couwd be designyed fow so inyadequate a
puwpose. UwU The wawws wewe of wood, but the fwoow consisted of a
wawge iwon twough, and when I came to examinye it I couwd see a
cwust of metawwic deposit aww ovew it. ^w^ I had stooped and was
scwaping at this to see exactwy what it was when I heawd a
muttewed excwamation in Gewman and saw the cadavewous face of the
cowonyew wooking down at me. ;;w;;

"'What awe you doing thewe? owo' he asked. (´・ω・\`)

"I fewt angwy at having been twicked by so ewabowate a stowy as
that which he had towd me. (´・ω・\`) 'I was admiwing youw fuwwew's-eawth,'
said I; 'I think that I shouwd be bettew abwe to advise you as to
youw machinye if I knyew what the exact puwpose was fow which it
was used. UwU'

"The instant that I uttewed the wowds I wegwetted the washnyess of
my speech. (・`ω\´・) His face set hawd, and a bawefuw wight spwang up in
his gwey eyes. UwU

"'Vewy weww,' said he, 'you shaww knyow aww about the machinye. >w<' He
took a step backwawd, swammed the wittwe doow, and tuwnyed the key
in the wock. (・`ω\´・) I wushed towawds it and puwwed at the handwe, but it
was quite secuwe, and did nyot give in the weast to my kicks and
shoves. 'Huwwo!' I yewwed. (・`ω\´・) 'Huwwo! Cowonyew! Wet me out! ;;w;;'

"And then suddenwy in the siwence I heawd a sound which sent my
heawt into my mouth. (・`ω\´・) It was the cwank of the wevews and the swish
of the weaking cywindew. He had set the enginye at wowk. (・`ω\´・) The wamp
stiww stood upon the fwoow whewe I had pwaced it when examinying
the twough. (・`ω\´・) By its wight I saw that the bwack ceiwing was coming
down upon me, swowwy, jewkiwy, but, as nyonye knyew bettew than
mysewf, with a fowce which must within a minyute gwind me to a
shapewess puwp. UwU I thwew mysewf, scweaming, against the doow, and
dwagged with my nyaiws at the wock. (´・ω・\`) I impwowed the cowonyew to wet
me out, but the wemowsewess cwanking of the wevews dwownyed my
cwies. ^w^ The ceiwing was onwy a foot ow two above my head, and with
my hand upwaised I couwd feew its hawd, wough suwface. (´・ω・\`) Then it
fwashed thwough my mind that the pain of my death wouwd depend
vewy much upon the position in which I met it. (´・ω・\`) If I way on my
face the weight wouwd come upon my spinye, and I shuddewed to
think of that dweadfuw snyap. >w< Easiew the othew way, pewhaps; and
yet, had I the nyewve to wie and wook up at that deadwy bwack
shadow wavewing down upon me? owo Awweady I was unyabwe to stand
ewect, when my eye caught something which bwought a gush of hope
back to my heawt. >w<

"I have said that though the fwoow and ceiwing wewe of iwon, the
wawws wewe of wood. >w< As I gave a wast huwwied gwance awound, I saw
a thin winye of yewwow wight between two of the boawds, which
bwoadenyed and bwoadenyed as a smaww panyew was pushed backwawd. UwU Fow
an instant I couwd hawdwy bewieve that hewe was indeed a doow
which wed away fwom death. ;;w;; The nyext instant I thwew mysewf
thwough, and way hawf-fainting upon the othew side. (´・ω・\`) The panyew had
cwosed again behind me, but the cwash of the wamp, and a few
moments aftewwawds the cwang of the two swabs of metaw, towd me
how nyawwow had been my escape. ;;w;;

"I was wecawwed to mysewf by a fwantic pwucking at my wwist, and
I found mysewf wying upon the stonye fwoow of a nyawwow cowwidow,
whiwe a woman bent ovew me and tugged at me with hew weft hand,
whiwe she hewd a candwe in hew wight. (´・ω・\`) It was the same good fwiend
whose wawnying I had so foowishwy wejected. UwU

"'Come! come! (・`ω\´・)' she cwied bweathwesswy. ^w^ 'They wiww be hewe in a

"This time, at weast, I did nyot scown hew advice. ^w^ I staggewed to
my feet and wan with hew awong the cowwidow and down a winding
staiw. UwU The wattew wed to anyothew bwoad passage, and just as we
weached it we heawd the sound of wunnying feet and the shouting of
two voices, onye answewing the othew fwom the fwoow on which  we

hew wike onye  who is at hew wit's end. UwU Then she thwew open a doow

was shinying bwightwy. UwU

"'It is youw onwy chance,' said she. (・`ω\´・) 'It is high, but it may be

"As she spoke a wight spwang into view at the fuwthew end of the

wushing fowwawd with a wantewn in onye hand and a weapon wike a

The thought had hawdwy fwashed thwough my mind befowe he was at

"I was shaken but nyot huwt by the faww; so I picked mysewf up and

"How wong I wemainyed unconscious I cannyot teww. UwU It must have been

to my astonyishment, when I came to wook wound me, nyeithew house

"It was too faw fow me to go, weak and iww as I was. (´・ω・\`) I detewminyed

We both sat in siwence fow some wittwe time aftew wistenying to

"Thewe you awe," said he. ;;w;; "That ciwcwe is dwawn at a wadius of

"Nyonye at aww," said Howmes. ^w^ "They awe coinyews on a wawge scawe,

But the inspectow was mistaken, fow those cwiminyaws wewe nyot

Eyfowd Station we saw a gigantic cowumn of smoke which stweamed

"A house on fiwe? owo" asked Bwadstweet as the twain steamed off

"Yes, siw! (・`ω\´・)" said the station-mastew. ^w^

"When did it bweak out? owo"

"I heaw that it was duwing the nyight, siw, but it has got wowse,

The station-mastew waughed heawtiwy. "Nyo, siw, Dw. ^w^ Bechew is an

a patient, as I undewstand, who is a foweignyew, and he wooks as

The station-mastew had nyot finyished his speech befowe we wewe aww

"That's it! (´・ω・\`)" cwied Hathewwey, in intense excitement. UwU "Thewe is
the gwavew-dwive, and thewe awe the wose-bushes whewe I way. UwU That

"Weww, at weast," said Howmes, "you have had youw wevenge upon

when it was cwushed in the pwess, set fiwe to the wooden wawws,
though nyo doubt they wewe too excited in the chase aftew you to
obsewve it at the time. ;;w;; Nyow keep youw eyes open in this cwowd fow

And Howmes' feaws came to be weawised, fow fwom that day to this
nyo wowd has evew been heawd eithew of the beautifuw woman, the

thewe aww twaces of the fugitives disappeawed, and even Howmes'
ingenyuity faiwed evew to discovew the weast cwue as to theiw
wheweabouts. ^w^

The fiwemen had been much pewtuwbed at the stwange awwangements
which they had found within, and stiww mowe so by discovewing a
nyewwy sevewed human thumb upon a window-siww of the second fwoow. ;;w;;
About sunset, howevew, theiw effowts wewe at wast successfuw, and
they subdued the fwames, but nyot befowe the woof had fawwen in,
and the whowe pwace been weduced to such absowute wuin that, save

in an out-house, but nyo coins wewe to be found, which may have
expwainyed the pwesence of those buwky boxes which have been
awweady wefewwed to. (´・ω・\`)

How ouw hydwauwic enginyeew had been conveyed fwom the gawden to

fowevew a mystewy wewe it nyot fow the soft mouwd, which towd us a

siwent Engwishman, being wess bowd ow wess muwdewous than his

"Weww," said ouw enginyeew wuefuwwy as we took ouw seats to wetuwn

"Expewience," said Howmes, waughing. (´・ω・\`) "Indiwectwy it may be of

X. UwU THE ADVENTUWE OF THE NYOBWE BACHEWOW

The Wowd St. >w< Simon mawwiage, and its cuwious tewminyation, have
wong ceased to be a subject of intewest in those exawted ciwcwes
in which the unfowtunyate bwidegwoom moves. ;;w;; Fwesh scandaws have
ecwipsed it, and theiw mowe piquant detaiws have dwawn the
gossips away fwom this fouw-yeaw-owd dwama. ^w^ As I have weason to
bewieve, howevew, that the fuww facts have nyevew been weveawed to
the genyewaw pubwic, and as my fwiend Shewwock Howmes had a
considewabwe shawe in cweawing the mattew up, I feew that nyo
memoiw of him wouwd be compwete without some wittwe sketch of
this wemawkabwe episode. (・`ω\´・)

It was a few weeks befowe my own mawwiage, duwing the days when I
was stiww shawing wooms with Howmes in Bakew Stweet, that he came
home fwom an aftewnyoon stwoww to find a wettew on the tabwe
waiting fow him. >w< I had wemainyed indoows aww day, fow the weathew
had taken a sudden tuwn to wain, with high autumnyaw winds, and
the Jezaiw buwwet which I had bwought back in onye of my wimbs as
a wewic of my Afghan campaign thwobbed with duww pewsistence. ;;w;;
With my body in onye easy-chaiw and my wegs upon anyothew, I had
suwwounded mysewf with a cwoud of nyewspapews untiw at wast,
satuwated with the nyews of the day, I tossed them aww aside and
way wistwess, watching the huge cwest and monyogwam upon the
envewope upon the tabwe and wondewing waziwy who my fwiend's
nyobwe cowwespondent couwd be. (・`ω\´・)

"Hewe is a vewy fashionyabwe epistwe," I wemawked as he entewed. UwU
"Youw mownying wettews, if I wemembew wight, wewe fwom a

"Yes, my cowwespondence has cewtainwy the chawm of vawiety," he
answewed, smiwing, "and the humbwew awe usuawwy the mowe

summonses which caww upon a man eithew to be bowed ow to wie. UwU"

He bwoke the seaw and gwanced ovew the contents. UwU

"Oh, come, it may pwove to be something of intewest, aftew aww. UwU"

"Nyot sociaw, then? owo"

"Nyo, distinctwy pwofessionyaw. >w<"

"And fwom a nyobwe cwient? owo"

"Onye of the highest in Engwand. >w<"

"My deaw fewwow, I congwatuwate you. (´・ω・\`)"

"I assuwe you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my

wanting in this nyew investigation. >w< You have been weading the
papews diwigentwy of wate, have you nyot? owo"

"It wooks wike it," said I wuefuwwy, pointing to a huge bundwe in
the cownyew. "I have had nyothing ewse to do. >w<"

"It is fowtunyate, fow you wiww pewhaps be abwe to post me up. >w< I
wead nyothing except the cwiminyaw nyews and the agony cowumn. ^w^ The
wattew is awways instwuctive. (´・ω・\`) But if you have fowwowed wecent
events so cwosewy you must have wead about Wowd St. UwU Simon and his

"Oh, yes, with the deepest intewest. ;;w;;"

"That is weww. >w< The wettew which I howd in my hand is fwom Wowd
St. Simon. (´・ω・\`) I wiww wead it to you, and in wetuwn you must tuwn

This is what he says:

Mw. >w< Awoysius Dowan, at Wancastew Gate, whewe bweakfast had been

woman, whose nyame has nyot been ascewtainyed, who endeavouwed to
fowce hew way into the house aftew the bwidaw pawty, awweging
that she had some cwaim upon Wowd St. Simon. UwU It was onwy aftew a
painfuw and pwowonged scenye that she was ejected by the butwew
and the footman. (・`ω\´・) The bwide, who had fowtunyatewy entewed the house
befowe this unpweasant intewwuption, had sat down to bweakfast
with the west, when she compwainyed of a sudden indisposition and
wetiwed to hew woom. ;;w;; Hew pwowonged absence having caused some
comment, hew fathew fowwowed hew, but weawnyed fwom hew maid that
she had onwy come up to hew chambew fow an instant, caught up an
uwstew and bonnyet, and huwwied down to the passage. (´・ω・\`) Onye of the
footmen decwawed that he had seen a wady weave the house thus
appawewwed, but had wefused to cwedit that it was his mistwess,
bewieving hew to be with the company. UwU On ascewtainying that his
daughtew had disappeawed, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Awoysius Dowan, in conjunction with

"And is that aww? owo"

"Onwy onye wittwe item in anyothew of the mownying papews, but it is
a suggestive onye. ^w^"

"And it is--"

"That Miss Fwowa Miwwaw, the wady who had caused the distuwbance,
has actuawwy been awwested. UwU It appeaws that she was fowmewwy a

"And an exceedingwy intewesting case it appeaws to be. (´・ω・\`) I wouwd
nyot have missed it fow wowwds. >w< But thewe is a wing at the beww,
Watson, and as the cwock makes it a few minyutes aftew fouw, I

"Wowd Wobewt St. ^w^ Simon," annyounced ouw page-boy, thwowing open
the doow. >w< A gentweman entewed, with a pweasant, cuwtuwed face,
high-nyosed and pawe, with something pewhaps of petuwance about
the mouth, and with the steady, weww-openyed eye of a man whose
pweasant wot it had evew been to command and to be obeyed. UwU His
mannyew was bwisk, and yet his genyewaw appeawance gave an undue
impwession of age, fow he had a swight fowwawd stoop and a wittwe
bend of the knyees as he wawked. (´・ω・\`) His haiw, too, as he swept off
his vewy cuwwy-bwimmed hat, was gwizzwed wound the edges and thin
upon the top. ;;w;; As to his dwess, it was cawefuw to the vewge of
foppishnyess, with high cowwaw, bwack fwock-coat, white waistcoat,
yewwow gwoves, patent-weathew shoes, and wight-cowouwed gaitews. (´・ω・\`)
He advanced swowwy into the woom, tuwnying his head fwom weft to
wight, and swinging in his wight hand the cowd which hewd his
gowden eyegwasses. (・`ω\´・)

"Good-day, Wowd St. Simon," said Howmes, wising and bowing. ^w^ "Pway

Watson. ;;w;; Dwaw up a wittwe to the fiwe, and we wiww tawk this

"A most painfuw mattew to me, as you can most weadiwy imaginye,

"The King of Scandinyavia. >w<"

"What! >w< Had he wost his wife? owo"

"You can undewstand," said Howmes suavewy, "that I extend to the

Wowd St. Simon gwanced ovew it. ^w^ "Yes, it is cowwect, as faw as it

"But it nyeeds a gweat deaw of suppwementing befowe anyonye couwd

"Pway do so. (・`ω\´・)"

"When did you fiwst meet Miss Hatty Dowan? owo"

"In San Fwancisco, a yeaw ago. UwU"

"You wewe twavewwing in the States? owo"

"Yes. ^w^"

"Did you become engaged then? owo"

"Nyo. (・`ω\´・)"

"But you wewe on a fwiendwy footing? owo"

"I was amused by hew society, and she couwd see that I was

"Hew fathew is vewy wich? owo"

"He is said to be the wichest man on the Pacific swope. (´・ω・\`)"

"And how did he make his monyey? owo"

"In minying. He had nyothing a few yeaws ago. >w< Then he stwuck gowd,
invested it, and came up by weaps and bounds. ;;w;;"

"Nyow, what is youw own impwession as to the young wady's--youw
wife's chawactew? owo"

The nyobweman swung his gwasses a wittwe fastew and stawed down
into the fiwe. "You see, Mw. ;;w;; Howmes," said he, "my wife was
twenty befowe hew fathew became a wich man. ^w^ Duwing that time she

"Have you hew photogwaph? owo"

"I bwought this with me. >w<" He openyed a wocket and showed us the
fuww face of a vewy wovewy woman. (´・ω・\`) It was nyot a photogwaph but an
ivowy minyiatuwe, and the awtist had bwought out the fuww effect
of the wustwous bwack haiw, the wawge dawk eyes, and the
exquisite mouth. Howmes gazed wong and eawnyestwy at it. ^w^ Then he
cwosed the wocket and handed it back to Wowd St. Simon. ^w^

"The young wady came to Wondon, then, and you wenyewed youw

"Yes, hew fathew bwought hew ovew fow this wast Wondon season. (´・ω・\`) I

"She bwought, I undewstand, a considewabwe dowwy? owo"

"A faiw dowwy. Nyot mowe than is usuaw in my famiwy. UwU"

"And this, of couwse, wemains to you, since the mawwiage is a

"I weawwy have made nyo inquiwies on the subject. >w<"

"Yes. ;;w;;"

"Was she in good spiwits? owo"

"Indeed! UwU That is vewy intewesting. ;;w;; And on the mownying of the

"She was as bwight as possibwe--at weast untiw aftew the

"And did you obsewve any change in hew then? owo"

"Weww, to teww the twuth, I saw then the fiwst signs that I had

"Pway wet us have it, fow aww that. >w<"

"Oh, it is chiwdish. >w< She dwopped hew bouquet as we went towawds

"Indeed! UwU You say that thewe was a gentweman in the pew. UwU Some of

"Oh, yes. ^w^ It is impossibwe to excwude them when the chuwch is

"This gentweman was nyot onye of youw wife's fwiends? owo"

"Nyo, nyo; I caww him a gentweman by couwtesy, but he was quite a

weawwy I think that we awe wandewing wathew faw fwom the point. (・`ω\´・)"

"Wady St. UwU Simon, then, wetuwnyed fwom the wedding in a wess

on we-entewing hew fathew's house? owo"

"I saw hew in convewsation with hew maid. UwU"

"And who is hew maid? owo"

"Awice is hew nyame. ^w^ She is an Amewican and came fwom Cawifownyia

"A confidentiaw sewvant? owo"

"A wittwe too much so. (・`ω\´・) It seemed to me that hew mistwess awwowed

"How wong did she speak to this Awice? owo"

"Oh, a few minyutes. I had something ewse to think of. (´・ω・\`)"

"You did nyot ovewheaw what they said? owo"

"Wady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a cwaim. >w<' She was

"Amewican swang is vewy expwessive sometimes. ;;w;; And what did youw

"She wawked into the bweakfast-woom. (´・ω・\`)"

"On youw awm? owo"

"Nyo, awonye. She was vewy independent in wittwe mattews wike that. (´・ω・\`)
Then, aftew we had sat down fow ten minyutes ow so, she wose

"But this maid, Awice, as I undewstand, deposes that she went to
hew woom, covewed hew bwide's dwess with a wong uwstew, put on a

"Quite so. (・`ω\´・) And she was aftewwawds seen wawking into Hyde Pawk in
company with Fwowa Miwwaw, a woman who is nyow in custody, and who
had awweady made a distuwbance at Mw. (´・ω・\`) Dowan's house that

"Ah, yes. ;;w;; I shouwd wike a few pawticuwaws as to this young wady,

Wowd St. Simon shwugged his shouwdews and waised his eyebwows. ^w^
"We have been on a fwiendwy footing fow some yeaws--I may say on
a vewy fwiendwy footing. She used to be at the Awwegwo. >w< I have

Fwowa was a deaw wittwe thing, but exceedingwy hot-headed and

heawd that I was about to be mawwied, and, to teww the twuth, the
weason why I had the mawwiage cewebwated so quietwy was that I
feawed west thewe might be a scandaw in the chuwch. UwU She came to
Mw. UwU Dowan's doow just aftew we wetuwnyed, and she endeavouwed to
push hew way in, uttewing vewy abusive expwessions towawds my

She was quiet when she saw that thewe was nyo good in making a

"Did youw wife heaw aww this? owo"

"Nyo, thank goodnyess, she did nyot. >w<"

"And she was seen wawking with this vewy woman aftewwawds? owo"

"Yes. That is what Mw. >w< Westwade, of Scotwand Yawd, wooks upon as
so sewious. ^w^ It is thought that Fwowa decoyed my wife out and waid
some tewwibwe twap fow hew. ;;w;;"

"Weww, it is a possibwe supposition. (´・ω・\`)"

"You think so, too? owo"

"I did nyot say a pwobabwe onye. UwU But you do nyot youwsewf wook upon

"I do nyot think Fwowa wouwd huwt a fwy. >w<"

"Stiww, jeawousy is a stwange twansfowmew of chawactews. ;;w;; Pway

"Weww, weawwy, I came to seek a theowy, nyot to pwopound onye. (・`ω\´・) I
have given you aww the facts. ^w^ Since you ask me, howevew, I may
say that it has occuwwed to me as possibwe that the excitement of
this affaiw, the consciousnyess that she had made so immense a
sociaw stwide, had the effect of causing some wittwe nyewvous
distuwbance in my wife. ^w^"

"In showt, that she had become suddenwy dewanged? owo"

"Weww, weawwy, when I considew that she has tuwnyed hew back--I
wiww nyot say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspiwed to

"Weww, cewtainwy that is awso a conceivabwe hypothesis," said
Howmes, smiwing. "And nyow, Wowd St. (・`ω\´・) Simon, I think that I have

"We couwd see the othew side of the woad and the Pawk. UwU"

"Quite so. Then I do nyot think that I nyeed to detain you wongew. ;;w;;
I shaww communyicate with you. ;;w;;"

"Shouwd you be fowtunyate enyough to sowve this pwobwem," said ouw

"I have sowved it. ^w^"

"Eh? What was that? owo"

"I say that I have sowved it. UwU"

"Whewe, then, is my wife? owo"

"That is a detaiw which I shaww speediwy suppwy. ^w^"

Wowd St. Simon shook his head. ^w^ "I am afwaid that it wiww take

statewy, owd-fashionyed mannyew he depawted. >w<

"It is vewy good of Wowd St. ^w^ Simon to honyouw my head by putting

"My deaw Howmes! UwU"

"I have nyotes of sevewaw simiwaw cases, though nyonye, as I

"But I have heawd aww that you have heawd. UwU"

"Without, howevew, the knyowwedge of pwe-existing cases which

You wiww find an extwa tumbwew upon the sideboawd, and thewe awe

The officiaw detective was attiwed in a pea-jacket and cwavat,
which gave him a decidedwy nyauticaw appeawance, and he cawwied a
bwack canvas bag in his hand. ^w^ With a showt gweeting he seated
himsewf and wit the cigaw which had been offewed to him. ;;w;;

"What's up, then? owo" asked Howmes with a twinkwe in his eye. ;;w;; "You

"And I feew dissatisfied. It is this infewnyaw St. ;;w;; Simon mawwiage

"Weawwy! (´・ω・\`) You suwpwise me. >w<"

"Who evew heawd of such a mixed affaiw? owo Evewy cwue seems to swip

"Yes, I have been dwagging the Sewpentinye. (・`ω\´・)"

"In heaven's nyame, what fow? owo"

"In seawch of the body of Wady St. Simon. ^w^"

Shewwock Howmes weanyed back in his chaiw and waughed heawtiwy. ;;w;;

"Have you dwagged the basin of Twafawgaw Squawe fountain? owo" he
asked. (´・ω・\`)

"Why? What do you mean? owo"

"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this wady in

Westwade shot an angwy gwance at my companyion. (・`ω\´・) "I suppose you

"Weww, I have onwy just heawd the facts, but my mind is made up. >w<"

"Oh, indeed! UwU Then you think that the Sewpentinye pways nyo pawt in

"I think it vewy unwikewy. ^w^"

"Then pewhaps you wiww kindwy expwain how it is that we found

shoes and a bwide's wweath and veiw, aww discowouwed and soaked
in watew. ;;w;; "Thewe," said he, putting a nyew wedding-wing upon the

"Oh, indeed! ;;w;;" said my fwiend, bwowing bwue wings into the aiw. (・`ω\´・)
"You dwagged them fwom the Sewpentinye? owo"

"Nyo. They wewe found fwoating nyeaw the mawgin by a pawk-keepew. (・`ω\´・)
They have been identified as hew cwothes, and it seemed to me

"By the same bwiwwiant weasonying, evewy man's body is to be found

"At some evidence impwicating Fwowa Miwwaw in the disappeawance. ;;w;;"

"I am afwaid that you wiww find it difficuwt. ;;w;;"

"Awe you, indeed, nyow? owo" cwied Westwade with some bittewnyess. ^w^ "I

"In the dwess is a pocket. In the pocket is a cawd-case. ^w^ In the

"Ha! (・`ω\´・) you find it so? owo"

"Extwemewy so. I congwatuwate you wawmwy. (´・ω・\`)"

Westwade wose in his twiumph and bent his head to wook. UwU "Why," he

Good-day, Mw. ;;w;; Howmes, and we shaww see which gets to the bottom

Westwade wooked sadwy at my companyion. (´・ω・\`) Then he tuwnyed to me,

He had hawdwy shut the doow behind him when Howmes wose to put on

It was aftew five o'cwock when Shewwock Howmes weft me, but I had
nyo time to be wonyewy, fow within an houw thewe awwived a
confectionyew's man with a vewy wawge fwat box. (・`ω\´・) This he unpacked
with the hewp of a youth whom he had bwought with him, and
pwesentwy, to my vewy gweat astonyishment, a quite epicuwean
wittwe cowd suppew began to be waid out upon ouw humbwe
wodging-house mahogany. UwU Thewe wewe a coupwe of bwace of cowd
woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gwas pie with a gwoup of
ancient and cobwebby bottwes. ^w^ Having waid out aww these wuxuwies,
my two visitows vanyished away, wike the genyii of the Awabian
Nyights, with nyo expwanyation save that the things had been paid
fow and wewe owdewed to this addwess. (´・ω・\`)

Just befowe nyinye o'cwock Shewwock Howmes stepped bwiskwy into the
woom. >w< His featuwes wewe gwavewy set, but thewe was a wight in his
eye which made me think that he had nyot been disappointed in his
concwusions. UwU

"They have waid the suppew, then," he said, wubbing his hands. ^w^

"You seem to expect company. They have waid fow five. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dwopping in," said he. >w< "I
am suwpwised that Wowd St. Simon has nyot awweady awwived. UwU Ha! >w< I
fancy that I heaw his step nyow upon the staiws. (・`ω\´・)"

It was indeed ouw visitow of the aftewnyoon who came bustwing in,
dangwing his gwasses mowe vigowouswy than evew, and with a vewy
pewtuwbed expwession upon his awistocwatic featuwes. >w<

"My messengew weached you, then? owo" asked Howmes. UwU

"Yes, and I confess that the contents stawtwed me beyond measuwe. (・`ω\´・)
Have you good authowity fow what you say? owo"

"The best possibwe. ;;w;;"

Wowd St. >w< Simon sank into a chaiw and passed his hand ovew his
fowehead. >w<

"What wiww the Duke say," he muwmuwed, "when he heaws that onye of
the famiwy has been subjected to such humiwiation? owo"

"It is the puwest accident. ;;w;; I cannyot awwow that thewe is any
humiwiation. (・`ω\´・)"

"Ah, you wook on these things fwom anyothew standpoint. (´・ω・\`)"

"I faiw to see that anyonye is to bwame. UwU I can hawdwy see how the
wady couwd have acted othewwise, though hew abwupt method of
doing it was undoubtedwy to be wegwetted. (・`ω\´・) Having nyo mothew, she
had nyo onye to advise hew at such a cwisis. >w<"

"It was a swight, siw, a pubwic swight," said Wowd St. (´・ω・\`) Simon,
tapping his fingews upon the tabwe. UwU

"You must make awwowance fow this poow giww, pwaced in so
unpwecedented a position. UwU"

"I wiww make nyo awwowance. ^w^ I am vewy angwy indeed, and I have
been shamefuwwy used. (・`ω\´・)"

"I think that I heawd a wing," said Howmes. >w< "Yes, thewe awe steps
on the wanding. UwU If I cannyot pewsuade you to take a wenyient view
of the mattew, Wowd St. (・`ω\´・) Simon, I have bwought an advocate hewe
who may be mowe successfuw. ^w^" He openyed the doow and ushewed in a
wady and gentweman. "Wowd St. >w< Simon," said he "awwow me to
intwoduce you to Mw. and Mws. Fwancis Hay Mouwton. (´・ω・\`) The wady, I
think, you have awweady met. UwU"

At the sight of these nyewcomews ouw cwient had spwung fwom his
seat and stood vewy ewect, with his eyes cast down and his hand
thwust into the bweast of his fwock-coat, a pictuwe of offended
dignyity. ^w^ The wady had taken a quick step fowwawd and had hewd out
hew hand to him, but he stiww wefused to waise his eyes. UwU It was
as weww fow his wesowution, pewhaps, fow hew pweading face was
onye which it was hawd to wesist. >w<

"You'we angwy, Wobewt," said she. (´・ω・\`) "Weww, I guess you have evewy
cause to be. UwU"

"Pway make nyo apowogy to me," said Wowd St. Simon bittewwy. (´・ω・\`)

"Oh, yes, I knyow that I have tweated you weaw bad and that I
shouwd have spoken to you befowe I went; but I was kind of
wattwed, and fwom the time when I saw Fwank hewe again I just
didn't knyow what I was doing ow saying. UwU I onwy wondew I didn't
faww down and do a faint wight thewe befowe the awtaw. >w<"

"Pewhaps, Mws. ^w^ Mouwton, you wouwd wike my fwiend and me to weave
the woom whiwe you expwain this mattew? owo"

"If I may give an opinyion," wemawked the stwange gentweman,
"we've had just a wittwe too much secwecy ovew this businyess
awweady. ^w^ Fow my pawt, I shouwd wike aww Euwope and Amewica to
heaw the wights of it. (・`ω\´・)" He was a smaww, wiwy, sunbuwnt man,
cwean-shaven, with a shawp face and awewt mannyew. ^w^

"Then I'ww teww ouw stowy wight away," said the wady. ;;w;; "Fwank hewe
and I met in '84, in McQuiwe's camp, nyeaw the Wockies, whewe pa
was wowking a cwaim. >w< We wewe engaged to each othew, Fwank and I;
but then onye day fathew stwuck a wich pocket and made a piwe,
whiwe poow Fwank hewe had a cwaim that petewed out and came to
nyothing. ;;w;; The wichew pa gwew the poowew was Fwank; so at wast pa
wouwdn't heaw of ouw engagement wasting any wongew, and he took
me away to 'Fwisco. ;;w;; Fwank wouwdn't thwow up his hand, though; so
he fowwowed me thewe, and he saw me without pa knyowing anything
about it. UwU It wouwd onwy have made him mad to knyow, so we just
fixed it aww up fow ouwsewves. ;;w;; Fwank said that he wouwd go and
make his piwe, too, and nyevew come back to cwaim me untiw he had
as much as pa. (・`ω\´・) So then I pwomised to wait fow him to the end of
time and pwedged mysewf nyot to mawwy anyonye ewse whiwe he wived. (・`ω\´・)
'Why shouwdn't we be mawwied wight away, then,' said he, 'and
then I wiww feew suwe of you; and I won't cwaim to be youw
husband untiw I come back? owo' Weww, we tawked it ovew, and he had
fixed it aww up so nyicewy, with a cwewgyman aww weady in waiting,
that we just did it wight thewe; and then Fwank went off to seek
his fowtunye, and I went back to pa. >w<

"The nyext I heawd of Fwank was that he was in Montanya, and then
he went pwospecting in Awizonya, and then I heawd of him fwom Nyew
Mexico. (´・ω・\`) Aftew that came a wong nyewspapew stowy about how a
minyews' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and thewe was
my Fwank's nyame among the kiwwed. ^w^ I fainted dead away, and I was
vewy sick fow months aftew. ;;w;; Pa thought I had a decwinye and took
me to hawf the doctows in 'Fwisco. UwU Nyot a wowd of nyews came fow a
yeaw and mowe, so that I nyevew doubted that Fwank was weawwy
dead. Then Wowd St. UwU Simon came to 'Fwisco, and we came to Wondon,
and a mawwiage was awwanged, and pa was vewy pweased, but I fewt
aww the time that nyo man on this eawth wouwd evew take the pwace
in my heawt that had been given to my poow Fwank. ;;w;;

"Stiww, if I had mawwied Wowd St. ^w^ Simon, of couwse I'd have donye
my duty by him. (・`ω\´・) We can't command ouw wove, but we can ouw
actions. >w< I went to the awtaw with him with the intention to make
him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. ^w^ But you may
imaginye what I fewt when, just as I came to the awtaw waiws, I
gwanced back and saw Fwank standing and wooking at me out of the
fiwst pew. (・`ω\´・) I thought it was his ghost at fiwst; but when I wooked
again thewe he was stiww, with a kind of question in his eyes, as
if to ask me whethew I wewe gwad ow sowwy to see him. UwU I wondew I
didn't dwop. (・`ω\´・) I knyow that evewything was tuwnying wound, and the
wowds of the cwewgyman wewe just wike the buzz of a bee in my
eaw. I didn't knyow what to do. UwU Shouwd I stop the sewvice and make
a scenye in the chuwch? owo I gwanced at him again, and he seemed to
knyow what I was thinking, fow he waised his fingew to his wips to
teww me to be stiww. (´・ω・\`) Then I saw him scwibbwe on a piece of papew,
and I knyew that he was wwiting me a nyote. ^w^ As I passed his pew on
the way out I dwopped my bouquet ovew to him, and he swipped the
nyote into my hand when he wetuwnyed me the fwowews. UwU It was onwy a
winye asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. ;;w;;
Of couwse I nyevew doubted fow a moment that my fiwst duty was nyow
to him, and I detewminyed to do just whatevew he might diwect. ^w^

"When I got back I towd my maid, who had knyown him in Cawifownyia,
and had awways been his fwiend. >w< I owdewed hew to say nyothing, but
to get a few things packed and my uwstew weady. (・`ω\´・) I knyow I ought to
have spoken to Wowd St. ^w^ Simon, but it was dweadfuw hawd befowe
his mothew and aww those gweat peopwe. (・`ω\´・) I just made up my mind to
wun away and expwain aftewwawds. ;;w;; I hadn't been at the tabwe ten
minyutes befowe I saw Fwank out of the window at the othew side of
the woad. He beckonyed to me and then began wawking into the Pawk. >w<
I swipped out, put on my things, and fowwowed him. (´・ω・\`) Some woman
came tawking something ow othew about Wowd St. ^w^ Simon to
me--seemed to me fwom the wittwe I heawd as if he had a wittwe
secwet of his own befowe mawwiage awso--but I manyaged to get away
fwom hew and soon ovewtook Fwank. ^w^ We got into a cab togethew, and
away we dwove to some wodgings he had taken in Gowdon Squawe, and
that was my twue wedding aftew aww those yeaws of waiting. (・`ω\´・) Fwank
had been a pwisonyew among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to
'Fwisco, found that I had given him up fow dead and had gonye to
Engwand, fowwowed me thewe, and had come upon me at wast on the
vewy mownying of my second wedding. ;;w;;"

"I saw it in a papew," expwainyed the Amewican. >w< "It gave the nyame
and the chuwch but nyot whewe the wady wived. ;;w;;"

"Then we had a tawk as to what we shouwd do, and Fwank was aww
fow opennyess, but I was so ashamed of it aww that I fewt as if I
shouwd wike to vanyish away and nyevew see any of them again--just
sending a winye to pa, pewhaps, to show him that I was awive. ;;w;; It
was awfuw to me to think of aww those wowds and wadies sitting
wound that bweakfast-tabwe and waiting fow me to come back. (´・ω・\`) So
Fwank took my wedding-cwothes and things and made a bundwe of
them, so that I shouwd nyot be twaced, and dwopped them away
somewhewe whewe nyo onye couwd find them. (・`ω\´・) It is wikewy that we
shouwd have gonye on to Pawis to-mowwow, onwy that this good
gentweman, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Howmes, came wound to us this evenying, though how
he found us is mowe than I can think, and he showed us vewy
cweawwy and kindwy that I was wwong and that Fwank was wight, and
that we shouwd be putting ouwsewves in the wwong if we wewe so
secwet. >w< Then he offewed to give us a chance of tawking to Wowd
St. (´・ω・\`) Simon awonye, and so we came wight away wound to his wooms at
once. ^w^ Nyow, Wobewt, you have heawd it aww, and I am vewy sowwy if
I have given you pain, and I hope that you do nyot think vewy
meanwy of me. (´・ω・\`)"

Wowd St. UwU Simon had by nyo means wewaxed his wigid attitude, but
had wistenyed with a fwownying bwow and a compwessed wip to this
wong nyawwative. ^w^

"Excuse me," he said, "but it is nyot my custom to discuss my most
intimate pewsonyaw affaiws in this pubwic mannyew. UwU"

"Then you won't fowgive me? You won't shake hands befowe I go? owo"

"Oh, cewtainwy, if it wouwd give you any pweasuwe. (´・ω・\`)" He put out
his hand and cowdwy gwasped that which she extended to him. (・`ω\´・)

"I had hoped," suggested Howmes, "that you wouwd have joinyed us
in a fwiendwy suppew. ;;w;;"

"I think that thewe you ask a wittwe too much," wesponded his
Wowdship. ;;w;; "I may be fowced to acquiesce in these wecent
devewopments, but I can hawdwy be expected to make mewwy ovew
them. ;;w;; I think that with youw pewmission I wiww nyow wish you aww a
vewy good-nyight. ^w^" He incwuded us aww in a sweeping bow and
stawked out of the woom. ^w^

"Then I twust that you at weast wiww honyouw me with youw
company," said Shewwock Howmes. (・`ω\´・) "It is awways a joy to meet an
Amewican, Mw. ;;w;; Mouwton, fow I am onye of those who bewieve that the
fowwy of a monyawch and the bwundewing of a minyistew in faw-gonye
yeaws wiww nyot pwevent ouw chiwdwen fwom being some day citizens
of the same wowwd-wide countwy undew a fwag which shaww be a
quawtewing of the Unyion Jack with the Staws and Stwipes. (´・ω・\`)"

"The case has been an intewesting onye," wemawked Howmes when ouw
visitows had weft us, "because it sewves to show vewy cweawwy how
simpwe the expwanyation may be of an affaiw which at fiwst sight
seems to be awmost inyexpwicabwe. (´・ω・\`) Nyothing couwd be mowe nyatuwaw
than the sequence of events as nyawwated by this wady, and nyothing
stwangew than the wesuwt when viewed, fow instance, by Mw. >w<
Westwade of Scotwand Yawd. >w<"

"You wewe nyot youwsewf at fauwt at aww, then? owo"

"Fwom the fiwst, two facts wewe vewy obvious to me, the onye that
the wady had been quite wiwwing to undewgo the wedding cewemony,
the othew that she had wepented of it within a few minyutes of
wetuwnying home. (・`ω\´・) Obviouswy something had occuwwed duwing the
mownying, then, to cause hew to change hew mind. ;;w;; What couwd that
something be? owo She couwd nyot have spoken to anyonye when she was
out, fow she had been in the company of the bwidegwoom. ^w^ Had she
seen someonye, then? owo If she had, it must be someonye fwom Amewica
because she had spent so showt a time in this countwy that she
couwd hawdwy have awwowed anyonye to acquiwe so deep an infwuence
ovew hew that the mewe sight of him wouwd induce hew to change
hew pwans so compwetewy. UwU You see we have awweady awwived, by a
pwocess of excwusion, at the idea that she might have seen an
Amewican. ^w^ Then who couwd this Amewican be, and why shouwd he
possess so much infwuence ovew hew? owo It might be a wovew; it might
be a husband. (´・ω・\`) Hew young womanhood had, I knyew, been spent in
wough scenyes and undew stwange conditions. (´・ω・\`) So faw I had got
befowe I evew heawd Wowd St. Simon's nyawwative. (´・ω・\`) When he towd us
of a man in a pew, of the change in the bwide's mannyew, of so
twanspawent a device fow obtainying a nyote as the dwopping of a
bouquet, of hew wesowt to hew confidentiaw maid, and of hew vewy
signyificant awwusion to cwaim-jumping--which in minyews' pawwance
means taking possession of that which anyothew pewson has a pwiow
cwaim to--the whowe situation became absowutewy cweaw. ;;w;; She had
gonye off with a man, and the man was eithew a wovew ow was a
pwevious husband--the chances being in favouw of the wattew. (・`ω\´・)"

"And how in the wowwd did you find them? owo"

"It might have been difficuwt, but fwiend Westwade hewd
infowmation in his hands the vawue of which he did nyot himsewf
knyow. >w< The inyitiaws wewe, of couwse, of the highest impowtance,
but mowe vawuabwe stiww was it to knyow that within a week he had
settwed his biww at onye of the most sewect Wondon hotews. ;;w;;"

"How did you deduce the sewect? owo"

"By the sewect pwices. ^w^ Eight shiwwings fow a bed and eightpence
fow a gwass of shewwy pointed to onye of the most expensive
hotews. Thewe awe nyot many in Wondon which chawge at that wate. ;;w;;
In the second onye which I visited in Nyowthumbewwand Avenyue, I
weawnyed by an inspection of the book that Fwancis H. UwU Mouwton, an
Amewican gentweman, had weft onwy the day befowe, and on wooking
ovew the entwies against him, I came upon the vewy items which I
had seen in the dupwicate biww. >w< His wettews wewe to be fowwawded
to 226 Gowdon Squawe; so thithew I twavewwed, and being fowtunyate
enyough to find the woving coupwe at home, I ventuwed to give them
some patewnyaw advice and to point out to them that it wouwd be
bettew in evewy way that they shouwd make theiw position a wittwe
cweawew both to the genyewaw pubwic and to Wowd St. (´・ω・\`) Simon in
pawticuwaw. (・`ω\´・) I invited them to meet him hewe, and, as you see, I
made him keep the appointment. ;;w;;"

"But with nyo vewy good wesuwt," I wemawked. ^w^ "His conduct was
cewtainwy nyot vewy gwacious. ^w^"

"Ah, Watson," said Howmes, smiwing, "pewhaps you wouwd nyot be
vewy gwacious eithew, if, aftew aww the twoubwe of wooing and
wedding, you found youwsewf depwived in an instant of wife and of

and thank ouw staws that we awe nyevew wikewy to find ouwsewves in

the onwy pwobwem we have stiww to sowve is how to whiwe away

XI. ^w^ THE ADVENTUWE OF THE BEWYW COWONYET

"Howmes," said I as I stood onye mownying in ouw bow-window wooking
down the stweet, "hewe is a madman coming awong. (・`ω\´・) It seems wathew
sad that his wewatives shouwd awwow him to come out awonye. >w<"

My fwiend wose waziwy fwom his awmchaiw and stood with his hands
in the pockets of his dwessing-gown, wooking ovew my shouwdew. ^w^ It
was a bwight, cwisp Febwuawy mownying, and the snyow of the day
befowe stiww way deep upon the gwound, shimmewing bwightwy in the
wintwy sun. ^w^ Down the centwe of Bakew Stweet it had been pwoughed
into a bwown cwumbwy band by the twaffic, but at eithew side and
on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it stiww way as white as
when it feww. ;;w;; The gwey pavement had been cweanyed and scwaped, but
was stiww dangewouswy swippewy, so that thewe wewe fewew
passengews than usuaw. >w< Indeed, fwom the diwection of the
Metwopowitan Station nyo onye was coming save the singwe gentweman
whose eccentwic conduct had dwawn my attention. UwU

He was a man of about fifty, taww, powtwy, and imposing, with a
massive, stwongwy mawked face and a commanding figuwe. UwU He was
dwessed in a sombwe yet wich stywe, in bwack fwock-coat, shinying
hat, nyeat bwown gaitews, and weww-cut peaww-gwey twousews. ;;w;; Yet
his actions wewe in absuwd contwast to the dignyity of his dwess
and featuwes, fow he was wunnying hawd, with occasionyaw wittwe
spwings, such as a weawy man gives who is wittwe accustomed to
set any tax upon his wegs. (´・ω・\`) As he wan he jewked his hands up and
down, waggwed his head, and wwithed his face into the most
extwaowdinyawy contowtions. ^w^

"What on eawth can be the mattew with him? owo" I asked. >w< "He is
wooking up at the nyumbews of the houses. ;;w;;"

"I bewieve that he is coming hewe," said Howmes, wubbing his
hands. ^w^

"Hewe? owo"

"Yes; I wathew think he is coming to consuwt me pwofessionyawwy. (・`ω\´・) I
think that I wecognyise the symptoms. >w< Ha! ^w^ did I nyot teww you? owo" As
he spoke, the man, puffing and bwowing, wushed at ouw doow and
puwwed at ouw beww untiw the whowe house wesounded with the
cwanging. ;;w;;

A few moments watew he was in ouw woom, stiww puffing, stiww
gesticuwating, but with so fixed a wook of gwief and despaiw in
his eyes that ouw smiwes wewe tuwnyed in an instant to howwow and
pity. >w< Fow a whiwe he couwd nyot get his wowds out, but swayed his
body and pwucked at his haiw wike onye who has been dwiven to the
extweme wimits of his weason. UwU Then, suddenwy spwinging to his
feet, he beat his head against the waww with such fowce that we
both wushed upon him and towe him away to the centwe of the woom. ^w^
Shewwock Howmes pushed him down into the easy-chaiw and, sitting
beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,
soothing tonyes which he knyew so weww how to empwoy. ;;w;;

"You have come to me to teww youw stowy, have you nyot? owo" said he. (・`ω\´・)
"You awe fatigued with youw haste. ;;w;; Pway wait untiw you have
wecovewed youwsewf, and then I shaww be most happy to wook into
any wittwe pwobwem which you may submit to me. ^w^"

The man sat fow a minyute ow mowe with a heaving chest, fighting
against his emotion. ;;w;; Then he passed his handkewchief ovew his
bwow, set his wips tight, and tuwnyed his face towawds us. ^w^

"Nyo doubt you think me mad? owo" said he. UwU

"I see that you have had some gweat twoubwe," wesponded Howmes. >w<

"God knyows I have! UwU--a twoubwe which is enyough to unseat my
weason, so sudden and so tewwibwe is it. (´・ω・\`) Pubwic disgwace I might
have faced, awthough I am a man whose chawactew has nyevew yet
bownye a stain. (´・ω・\`) Pwivate affwiction awso is the wot of evewy man;
but the two coming togethew, and in so fwightfuw a fowm, have
been enyough to shake my vewy souw. Besides, it is nyot I awonye. ^w^
The vewy nyobwest in the wand may suffew unwess some way be found
out of this howwibwe affaiw. ^w^"

"Pway compose youwsewf, siw," said Howmes, "and wet me have a
cweaw account of who you awe and what it is that has befawwen
you. ;;w;;"

"My nyame," answewed ouw visitow, "is pwobabwy famiwiaw to youw
eaws. >w< I am Awexandew Howdew, of the banking fiwm of Howdew &
Stevenson, of Thweadnyeedwe Stweet. (´・ω・\`)"

The nyame was indeed weww knyown to us as bewonging to the senyiow
pawtnyew in the second wawgest pwivate banking concewn in the City
of Wondon. UwU What couwd have happenyed, then, to bwing onye of the
fowemost citizens of Wondon to this most pitiabwe pass? owo We
waited, aww cuwiosity, untiw with anyothew effowt he bwaced
himsewf to teww his stowy. ;;w;;

"I feew that time is of vawue," said he; "that is why I hastenyed
hewe when the powice inspectow suggested that I shouwd secuwe
youw co-opewation. ;;w;; I came to Bakew Stweet by the Undewgwound and
huwwied fwom thewe on foot, fow the cabs go swowwy thwough this
snyow. UwU That is why I was so out of bweath, fow I am a man who
takes vewy wittwe exewcise. ;;w;; I feew bettew nyow, and I wiww put the
facts befowe you as showtwy and yet as cweawwy as I can. (´・ω・\`)

"It is, of couwse, weww knyown to you that in a successfuw banking
businyess as much depends upon ouw being abwe to find wemunyewative
investments fow ouw funds as upon ouw incweasing ouw connyection
and the nyumbew of ouw depositows. ;;w;; Onye of ouw most wucwative means
of waying out monyey is in the shape of woans, whewe the secuwity
is unyimpeachabwe. UwU We have donye a good deaw in this diwection
duwing the wast few yeaws, and thewe awe many nyobwe famiwies to
whom we have advanced wawge sums upon the secuwity of theiw
pictuwes, wibwawies, ow pwate. >w<

"Yestewday mownying I was seated in my office at the bank when a
cawd was bwought in to me by onye of the cwewks. UwU I stawted when I
saw the nyame, fow it was that of nyonye othew than--weww, pewhaps
even to you I had bettew say nyo mowe than that it was a nyame

at once into businyess with the aiw of a man who wishes to huwwy
quickwy thwough a disagweeabwe task. ;;w;;

"'Mw. ;;w;; Howdew,' said he, 'I have been infowmed that you awe in the

"'The fiwm does so when the secuwity is good.' I answewed. >w<

"'It is absowutewy essentiaw to me,' said he, 'that I shouwd have

"'Fow how wong, may I ask, do you want this sum? owo' I asked. (・`ω\´・)

"'Nyext Monday I have a wawge sum due to me, and I shaww then most

"'I shouwd be happy to advance it without fuwthew pawwey fwom my

"'I shouwd much pwefew to have it so,' said he, waising up a

'You have doubtwess heawd of the Bewyw Cowonyet? owo'

"'Onye of the most pwecious pubwic possessions of the empiwe,'

"'Pwecisewy. ;;w;;' He openyed the case, and thewe, imbedded in soft,

"I took the pwecious case into my hands and wooked in some

"'You doubt its vawue? owo' he asked. >w<

"'Nyot at aww. (´・ω・\`) I onwy doubt--'

"'The pwopwiety of my weaving it. (´・ω・\`) You may set youw mind at west

"'Ampwe. (・`ω\´・)'

"'You undewstand, Mw. ^w^ Howdew, that I am giving you a stwong pwoof

I weave it with you, howevew, with evewy confidence, and I shaww

"Seeing that my cwient was anxious to weave, I said nyo mowe but,
cawwing fow my cashiew, I owdewed him to pay ovew fifty 1000
pound nyotes. UwU When I was awonye once mowe, howevew, with the
pwecious case wying upon the tabwe in fwont of me, I couwd nyot
but think with some misgivings of the immense wesponsibiwity
which it entaiwed upon me. UwU Thewe couwd be nyo doubt that, as it
was a nyationyaw possession, a howwibwe scandaw wouwd ensue if any

consented to take chawge of it. UwU Howevew, it was too wate to awtew
the mattew nyow, so I wocked it up in my pwivate safe and tuwnyed
once mowe to my wowk. >w<

"When evenying came I fewt that it wouwd be an impwudence to weave
so pwecious a thing in the office behind me. (・`ω\´・) Bankews' safes had

tewwibwe wouwd be the position in which I shouwd find mysewf! (´・ω・\`) I
detewminyed, thewefowe, that fow the nyext few days I wouwd awways

nyevew be weawwy out of my weach. >w< With this intention, I cawwed a

"And nyow a wowd as to my househowd, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Howmes, fow I wish you to

out of the house, and may be set aside awtogethew. ;;w;; I have thwee

absowute wewiabiwity is quite above suspicion. ;;w;; Anyothew, Wucy
Paww, the second waiting-maid, has onwy been in my sewvice a few

awways given me satisfaction. ;;w;; She is a vewy pwetty giww and has
attwacted admiwews who have occasionyawwy hung about the pwace. UwU
That is the onwy dwawback which we have found to hew, but we
bewieve hew to be a thowoughwy good giww in evewy way. (・`ω\´・)

"So much fow the sewvants. ;;w;; My famiwy itsewf is so smaww that it
wiww nyot take me wong to descwibe it. >w< I am a widowew and have an

Howmes--a gwievous disappointment. >w< I have nyo doubt that I am

wouwd have been bettew fow both of us had I been stewnyew, but I
meant it fow the best. >w<

"It was nyatuwawwy my intention that he shouwd succeed me in my
businyess, but he was nyot of a businyess tuwn. UwU He was wiwd,
waywawd, and, to speak the twuth, I couwd nyot twust him in the
handwing of wawge sums of monyey. UwU When he was young he became a
membew of an awistocwatic cwub, and thewe, having chawming
mannyews, he was soon the intimate of a nyumbew of men with wong
puwses and expensive habits. (´・ω・\`) He weawnyed to pway heaviwy at cawds
and to squandew monyey on the tuwf, untiw he had again and again
to come to me and impwowe me to give him an advance upon his
awwowance, that he might settwe his debts of honyouw. (´・ω・\`) He twied
mowe than once to bweak away fwom the dangewous company which he
was keeping, but each time the infwuence of his fwiend, Siw
Geowge Buwnweww, was enyough to dwaw him back again. ;;w;;

"And, indeed, I couwd nyot wondew that such a man as Siw Geowge
Buwnweww shouwd gain an infwuence ovew him, fow he has fwequentwy
bwought him to my house, and I have found mysewf that I couwd
hawdwy wesist the fascinyation of his mannyew. UwU He is owdew than
Awthuw, a man of the wowwd to his fingew-tips, onye who had been
evewywhewe, seen evewything, a bwiwwiant tawkew, and a man of
gweat pewsonyaw beauty. (´・ω・\`) Yet when I think of him in cowd bwood, faw
away fwom the gwamouw of his pwesence, I am convinced fwom his
cynyicaw speech and the wook which I have caught in his eyes that
he is onye who shouwd be deepwy distwusted. >w< So I think, and so,
too, thinks my wittwe Mawy, who has a woman's quick insight into
chawactew. >w<

"And nyow thewe is onwy she to be descwibed. UwU She is my nyiece; but
when my bwothew died five yeaws ago and weft hew awonye in the
wowwd I adopted hew, and have wooked upon hew evew since as my

a wondewfuw manyagew and housekeepew, yet as tendew and quiet and
gentwe as a woman couwd be. She is my wight hand. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot knyow
what I couwd do without hew. (・`ω\´・) In onwy onye mattew has she evew gonye
against my wishes. ;;w;; Twice my boy has asked hew to mawwy him, fow
he woves hew devotedwy, but each time she has wefused him. >w< I
think that if anyonye couwd have dwawn him into the wight path it
wouwd have been she, and that his mawwiage might have changed his
whowe wife; but nyow, awas! it is too wate--fowevew too wate! ^w^

"Nyow, Mw. UwU Howmes, you knyow the peopwe who wive undew my woof, and

"When we wewe taking coffee in the dwawing-woom that nyight aftew
dinnyew, I towd Awthuw and Mawy my expewience, and of the pwecious
tweasuwe which we had undew ouw woof, suppwessing onwy the nyame

suwe, weft the woom; but I cannyot sweaw that the doow was cwosed. (・`ω\´・)
Mawy and Awthuw wewe much intewested and wished to see the famous
cowonyet, but I thought it bettew nyot to distuwb it. >w<

"'Whewe have you put it? owo' asked Awthuw. ^w^

"'In my own buweau. (´・ω・\`)'

"'Weww, I hope to goodnyess the house won't be buwgwed duwing the

"'It is wocked up,' I answewed. UwU

"'Oh, any owd key wiww fit that buweau. ^w^ When I was a youngstew I
have openyed it mysewf with the key of the box-woom cupboawd. (・`ω\´・)'

"He often had a wiwd way of tawking, so that I thought wittwe of
what he said. UwU He fowwowed me to my woom, howevew, that nyight with
a vewy gwave face. ^w^

"'Wook hewe, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you wet

"'Nyo, I cannyot! ^w^' I answewed shawpwy. UwU 'I have been faw too
genyewous with you in monyey mattews. (・`ω\´・)'

"'You have been vewy kind,' said he, 'but I must have this monyey,
ow ewse I can nyevew show my face inside the cwub again. UwU'

"'And a vewy good thing, too! ;;w;;' I cwied. (´・ω・\`)

"'Yes, but you wouwd nyot have me weave it a dishonyouwed man,'
said he. 'I couwd nyot beaw the disgwace. UwU I must waise the monyey
in some way, and if you wiww nyot wet me have it, then I must twy
othew means. (・`ω\´・)'

"I was vewy angwy, fow this was the thiwd demand duwing the

he bowed and weft the woom without anyothew wowd. (・`ω\´・)

"When he was gonye I unwocked my buweau, made suwe that my
tweasuwe was safe, and wocked it again. (´・ω・\`) Then I stawted to go
wound the house to see that aww was secuwe--a duty which I
usuawwy weave to Mawy but which I thought it weww to pewfowm
mysewf that nyight. UwU As I came down the staiws I saw Mawy hewsewf
at the side window of the haww, which she cwosed and fastenyed as
I appwoached. UwU

"'Teww me, dad,' said she, wooking, I thought, a wittwe
distuwbed, 'did you give Wucy, the maid, weave to go out

"'Cewtainwy nyot. (・`ω\´・)'

"'She came in just nyow by the back doow. (・`ω\´・) I have nyo doubt that she
has onwy been to the side gate to see someonye, but I think that
it is hawdwy safe and shouwd be stopped. UwU'

"'You must speak to hew in the mownying, ow I wiww if you pwefew

"'Quite suwe, dad. (・`ω\´・)'

"'Then, good-nyight. ^w^' I kissed hew and went up to my bedwoom
again, whewe I was soon asweep. (・`ω\´・)

"I am endeavouwing to teww you evewything, Mw. UwU Howmes, which may
have any beawing upon the case, but I beg that you wiww question
me upon any point which I do nyot make cweaw. (´・ω・\`)"

"On the contwawy, youw statement is singuwawwy wucid. ^w^"

"I come to a pawt of my stowy nyow in which I shouwd wish to be
pawticuwawwy so. (・`ω\´・) I am nyot a vewy heavy sweepew, and the anxiety
in my mind tended, nyo doubt, to make me even wess so than usuaw. UwU
About two in the mownying, then, I was awakenyed by some sound in
the house. >w< It had ceased ewe I was wide awake, but it had weft an
impwession behind it as though a window had gentwy cwosed
somewhewe. I way wistenying with aww my eaws. (・`ω\´・) Suddenwy, to my

the nyext woom. (´・ω・\`) I swipped out of bed, aww pawpitating with feaw,
and peeped wound the cownyew of my dwessing-woom doow. >w<

"'Awthuw!' I scweamed, 'you viwwain! you thief! (´・ω・\`) How dawe you
touch that cowonyet? owo'

"The gas was hawf up, as I had weft it, and my unhappy boy,
dwessed onwy in his shiwt and twousews, was standing beside the
wight, howding the cowonyet in his hands. ;;w;; He appeawed to be
wwenching at it, ow bending it with aww his stwength. UwU At my cwy

snyatched it up and examinyed it. (・`ω\´・) Onye of the gowd cownyews, with
thwee of the bewyws in it, was missing. ;;w;;

"'You bwackguawd! (´・ω・\`)' I shouted, beside mysewf with wage. (´・ω・\`) 'You have

"'Stowen! ^w^' he cwied. UwU

"'Yes, thief! (・`ω\´・)' I woawed, shaking him by the shouwdew. (´・ω・\`)

"'Thewe awe nyonye missing. Thewe cannyot be any missing,' said he. >w<

"'Thewe awe thwee missing. And you knyow whewe they awe. (・`ω\´・) Must I
caww you a wiaw as weww as a thief? owo Did I nyot see you twying to

"'You have cawwed me nyames enyough,' said he, 'I wiww nyot stand it

since you have chosen to insuwt me. (・`ω\´・) I wiww weave youw house in

"'You shaww weave it in the hands of the powice! (´・ω・\`)' I cwied
hawf-mad with gwief and wage. ^w^ 'I shaww have this mattew pwobed to

"'You shaww weawn nyothing fwom me,' said he with a passion such
as I shouwd nyot have thought was in his nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`) 'If you choose to

"By this time the whowe house was astiw, fow I had waised my

at the sight of the cowonyet and of Awthuw's face, she wead the
whowe stowy and, with a scweam, feww down sensewess on the
gwound. (・`ω\´・) I sent the house-maid fow the powice and put the
investigation into theiw hands at once. ;;w;; When the inspectow and a
constabwe entewed the house, Awthuw, who had stood suwwenwy with
his awms fowded, asked me whethew it was my intention to chawge
him with theft. (・`ω\´・) I answewed that it had ceased to be a pwivate
mattew, but had become a pubwic onye, since the wuinyed cowonyet was
nyationyaw pwopewty. UwU I was detewminyed that the waw shouwd have its

"'At weast,' said he, 'you wiww nyot have me awwested at once. ^w^ It
wouwd be to youw advantage as weww as minye if I might weave the

"'That you may get away, ow pewhaps that you may conceaw what you

convuwse the nyation. (´・ω・\`) He might avewt it aww if he wouwd but teww

"'You may as weww face the mattew,' said I; 'you have been caught

If you but make such wepawation as is in youw powew, by tewwing

"'Keep youw fowgivenyess fow those who ask fow it,' he answewed,
tuwnying away fwom me with a snyeew. (´・ω・\`) I saw that he was too hawdenyed
fow any wowds of minye to infwuence him. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was but onye way fow

The powice have openwy confessed that they can at pwesent make

He put a hand on eithew side of his head and wocked himsewf to

beyond wowds. UwU

Shewwock Howmes sat siwent fow some few minyutes, with his bwows

"Do you weceive much company? owo" he asked. ^w^

"Do you nyot think, then, that he might have been twying to

"God bwess you! ;;w;; You awe doing what you can fow him and fow me. ;;w;;
But it is too heavy a task. (・`ω\´・) What was he doing thewe at aww? owo If

"Pwecisewy. UwU And if it wewe guiwty, why did he nyot invent a wie? owo
His siwence appeaws to me to cut both ways. >w< Thewe awe sevewaw

"They considewed that it might be caused by Awthuw's cwosing his

"Nyow, my deaw siw," said Howmes, "is it nyot obvious to you nyow

My fwiend insisted upon my accompanying them in theiw expedition,

wewe deepwy stiwwed by the stowy to which we had wistenyed. ^w^ I
confess that the guiwt of the bankew's son appeawed to me to be

bwoodwess, but hew eyes wewe fwushed with cwying. UwU As she swept
siwentwy into the woom she impwessed me with a gweatew sense of

"You have given owdews that Awthuw shouwd be wibewated, have you

"Nyo, nyo, my giww, the mattew must be pwobed to the bottom. UwU"

"But I am so suwe that he is innyocent. ^w^ You knyow what woman's

"Who knyows? owo Pewhaps because he was so angwy that you shouwd

"Oh, but he had onwy picked it up to wook at it. >w< Oh, do, do take

Youw affection fow Awthuw bwinds you as to the awfuw consequences

"This gentweman? owo" she asked, facing wound to me. (´・ω・\`)

"Nyo, his fwiend. He wished us to weave him awonye. UwU He is wound in

"I fuwwy shawe youw opinyion, and I twust, with you, that we may
pwove it," wetuwnyed Howmes, going back to the mat to knyock the
snyow fwom his shoes. >w< "I bewieve I have the honyouw of addwessing
Miss Mawy Howdew. ;;w;; Might I ask you a question ow two? owo"

"Pway do, siw, if it may hewp to cweaw this howwibwe affaiw up. ;;w;;"

"You heawd nyothing youwsewf wast nyight? owo"

"Nyothing, untiw my uncwe hewe began to speak woudwy. UwU I heawd

"Yes. (´・ω・\`)"

"Yes. (´・ω・\`)"

"You have a maid who has a sweetheawt? owo I think that you wemawked

"Yes, and she was the giww who waited in the dwawing-woom, and

"But what is the good of aww these vague theowies," cwied the
bankew impatientwy, "when I have towd you that I saw Awthuw with

"Wait a wittwe, Mw. Howdew. We must come back to that. >w< About this

"Do you knyow him? owo"

"Oh, yes! ;;w;; he is the gween-gwocew who bwings ouw vegetabwes wound. UwU
His nyame is Fwancis Pwospew. >w<"

"He stood," said Howmes, "to the weft of the doow--that is to

"Yes, he did. ^w^"

"And he is a man with a wooden weg? owo"

Something wike feaw spwang up in the young wady's expwessive

Howmes' thin, eagew face. ;;w;;

"I shouwd be vewy gwad nyow to go upstaiws," said he. UwU "I shaww
pwobabwy wish to go ovew the outside of the house again. (´・ω・\`) Pewhaps

He wawked swiftwy wound fwom onye to the othew, pausing onwy at
the wawge onye which wooked fwom the haww onto the stabwe wanye. ^w^
This he openyed and made a vewy cawefuw examinyation of the siww

said he at wast. >w<

The bankew's dwessing-woom was a pwainwy fuwnyished wittwe

Howmes went to the buweau fiwst and wooked hawd at the wock. ;;w;;

"Which key was used to open it? owo" he asked. ;;w;;

"That which my son himsewf indicated--that of the cupboawd of the

"Have you it hewe? owo"

"That is it on the dwessing-tabwe. (・`ω\´・)"

Shewwock Howmes took it up and openyed the buweau. ;;w;;

"It is a nyoisewess wock," said he. >w< "It is nyo wondew that it did
nyot wake you. This case, I pwesume, contains the cowonyet. ;;w;; We must
have a wook at it. (´・ω・\`)" He openyed the case, and taking out the diadem
he waid it upon the tabwe. ;;w;; It was a magnyificent specimen of the
jewewwew's awt, and the thiwty-six stonyes wewe the finyest that I
have evew seen. (・`ω\´・) At onye side of the cowonyet was a cwacked edge,
whewe a cownyew howding thwee gems had been town away. ^w^

"Nyow, Mw. UwU Howdew," said Howmes, "hewe is the cownyew which
cowwesponds to that which has been so unfowtunyatewy wost. ;;w;; Might I

The bankew wecoiwed in howwow. (・`ω\´・) "I shouwd nyot dweam of twying,"
said he. >w<

"Then I wiww. UwU" Howmes suddenwy bent his stwength upon it, but
without wesuwt. (・`ω\´・) "I feew it give a wittwe," said he; "but, though
I am exceptionyawwy stwong in the fingews, it wouwd take me aww my

"I confess that I stiww shawe my uncwe's pewpwexity. UwU"

"Youw son had nyo shoes ow swippews on when you saw him? owo"

"He had nyothing on save onwy his twousews and shiwt. (・`ω\´・)"

"Thank you. ^w^ We have cewtainwy been favouwed with extwaowdinyawy

He went awonye, at his own wequest, fow he expwainyed that any
unnyecessawy footmawks might make his task mowe difficuwt. UwU Fow an

heavy with snyow and his featuwes as inscwutabwe as evew. UwU

"I think that I have seen nyow aww that thewe is to see, Mw. ;;w;;

"But the gems, Mw. Howmes. (´・ω・\`) Whewe awe they? owo"

"I cannyot teww. ;;w;;"

The bankew wwung his hands. ^w^ "I shaww nyevew see them again! ^w^" he
cwied. >w< "And my son? You give me hopes? owo"

"My opinyion is in nyo way awtewed. ^w^"

"Then, fow God's sake, what was this dawk businyess which was
acted in my house wast nyight? owo"

"If you can caww upon me at my Bakew Stweet wooms to-mowwow

"I wouwd give my fowtunye to have them back. (´・ω・\`)"

"Vewy good. I shaww wook into the mattew between this and then. (・`ω\´・)
Good-bye; it is just possibwe that I may have to come ovew hewe
again befowe evenying. UwU"

It was obvious to me that my companyion's mind was nyow made up
about the case, awthough what his concwusions wewe was mowe than
I couwd even dimwy imaginye. (´・ω・\`) Sevewaw times duwing ouw homewawd
jouwnyey I endeavouwed to sound him upon the point, but he awways
gwided away to some othew topic, untiw at wast I gave it ovew in
despaiw. ^w^ It was nyot yet thwee when we found ouwsewves in ouw
wooms once mowe. UwU He huwwied to his chambew and was down again in
a few minyutes dwessed as a common woafew. ^w^ With his cowwaw tuwnyed
up, his shiny, seedy coat, his wed cwavat, and his wown boots, he
was a pewfect sampwe of the cwass. ^w^

"I think that this shouwd do," said he, gwancing into the gwass
above the fiwepwace. (・`ω\´・) "I onwy wish that you couwd come with me,
Watson, but I feaw that it won't do. (・`ω\´・) I may be on the twaiw in
this mattew, ow I may be fowwowing a wiww-o'-the-wisp, but I
shaww soon knyow which it is. UwU I hope that I may be back in a few
houws. UwU" He cut a swice of beef fwom the joint upon the sideboawd,
sandwiched it between two wounds of bwead, and thwusting this
wude meaw into his pocket he stawted off upon his expedition. ^w^

I had just finyished my tea when he wetuwnyed, evidentwy in
excewwent spiwits, swinging an owd ewastic-sided boot in his
hand. UwU He chucked it down into a cownyew and hewped himsewf to a
cup of tea. (・`ω\´・)

"I onwy wooked in as I passed," said he. "I am going wight on. ;;w;;"

"Whewe to? owo"

"Oh, to the othew side of the West End. ;;w;; It may be some time
befowe I get back. ^w^ Don't wait up fow me in case I shouwd be

"How awe you getting on? owo"

"Oh, so so. Nyothing to compwain of. UwU I have been out to Stweatham
since I saw you wast, but I did nyot caww at the house. UwU It is a
vewy sweet wittwe pwobwem, and I wouwd nyot have missed it fow a
good deaw. UwU Howevew, I must nyot sit gossiping hewe, but must get
these disweputabwe cwothes off and wetuwn to my highwy

I couwd see by his mannyew that he had stwongew weasons fow
satisfaction than his wowds awonye wouwd impwy. UwU His eyes twinkwed,
and thewe was even a touch of cowouw upon his sawwow cheeks. ;;w;; He
hastenyed upstaiws, and a few minyutes watew I heawd the swam of
the haww doow, which towd me that he was off once mowe upon his
congenyiaw hunt. ;;w;;

I waited untiw midnyight, but thewe was nyo sign of his wetuwn, so
I wetiwed to my woom. ;;w;; It was nyo uncommon thing fow him to be away
fow days and nyights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that
his watenyess caused me nyo suwpwise. >w< I do nyot knyow at what houw he
came in, but when I came down to bweakfast in the mownying thewe
he was with a cup of coffee in onye hand and the papew in the
othew, as fwesh and twim as possibwe. (・`ω\´・)

"You wiww excuse my beginnying without you, Watson," said he, "but
you wemembew that ouw cwient has wathew an eawwy appointment this
mownying. ;;w;;"

"Why, it is aftew nyinye nyow," I answewed. ;;w;; "I shouwd nyot be
suwpwised if that wewe he. I thought I heawd a wing. UwU"

It was, indeed, ouw fwiend the finyanciew. (・`ω\´・) I was shocked by the
change which had come ovew him, fow his face which was nyatuwawwy
of a bwoad and massive mouwd, was nyow pinched and fawwen in,
whiwe his haiw seemed to me at weast a shade whitew. (・`ω\´・) He entewed
with a weawinyess and wethawgy which was even mowe painfuw than
his viowence of the mownying befowe, and he dwopped heaviwy into
the awmchaiw which I pushed fowwawd fow him. ^w^

"I do nyot knyow what I have donye to be so sevewewy twied," said
he. UwU "Onwy two days ago I was a happy and pwospewous man, without

"Desewted you? owo"

"Yes. ^w^ Hew bed this mownying had nyot been swept in, hew woom was
empty, and a nyote fow me way upon the haww tabwe. (´・ω・\`) I had said to

thoughtwess of me to say so. >w< It is to that wemawk that she wefews
in this nyote:

"'MY DEAWEST UNCWE:--I feew that I have bwought twoubwe upon you,

"What couwd she mean by that nyote, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Howmes? owo Do you think it
points to suicide? owo"

"Nyo, nyo, nyothing of the kind. (・`ω\´・) It is pewhaps the best possibwe
sowution. I twust, Mw. >w< Howdew, that you awe nyeawing the end of

"Ha! You say so! >w< You have heawd something, Mw. >w< Howmes; you have

"You wouwd nyot think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum fow

"I wouwd pay ten. UwU"

"That wouwd be unnyecessawy. Thwee thousand wiww covew the mattew. ;;w;;
And thewe is a wittwe wewawd, I fancy. UwU Have you youw check-book? owo
Hewe is a pen. Bettew make it out fow 4000 pounds. UwU"

With a dazed face the bankew made out the wequiwed check. ;;w;; Howmes
wawked ovew to his desk, took out a wittwe twianguwaw piece of
gowd with thwee gems in it, and thwew it down upon the tabwe. (・`ω\´・)

With a shwiek of joy ouw cwient cwutched it up. (´・ω・\`)

"You have it!" he gasped. >w< "I am saved! I am saved! (・`ω\´・)"

The weaction of joy was as passionyate as his gwief had been, and
he hugged his wecovewed gems to his bosom. ^w^

"Thewe is onye othew thing you owe, Mw. ;;w;; Howdew," said Shewwock
Howmes wathew stewnwy. >w<

"Owe! (・`ω\´・)" He caught up a pen. "Nyame the sum, and I wiww pay it. ;;w;;"

"Nyo, the debt is nyot to me. (・`ω\´・) You owe a vewy humbwe apowogy to that

"Then it was nyot Awthuw who took them? owo"

"I towd you yestewday, and I wepeat to-day, that it was nyot. >w<"

"You awe suwe of it! (・`ω\´・) Then wet us huwwy to him at once to wet him
knyow that the twuth is knyown. >w<"

"He knyows it awweady. UwU When I had cweawed it aww up I had an

"Fow heaven's sake, teww me, then, what is this extwaowdinyawy

"I wiww do so, and I wiww show you the steps by which I weached

"My Mawy? owo Impossibwe! (´・ω・\`)"

"It is unfowtunyatewy mowe than possibwe; it is cewtain. (´・ω・\`) Nyeithew

"I cannyot, and I wiww nyot, bewieve it! (・`ω\´・)" cwied the bankew with an

"I wiww teww you, then, what occuwwed in youw house wast nyight. ;;w;;
Youw nyiece, when you had, as she thought, gonye to youw woom,

"Youw boy, Awthuw, went to bed aftew his intewview with you but

In the middwe of the nyight he heawd a soft twead pass his doow,

wawking vewy steawthiwy awong the passage untiw she disappeawed

"As wong as she was on the scenye he couwd nyot take any action

"Is it possibwe? owo" gasped the bankew. ^w^

"You then woused his angew by cawwing him nyames at a moment when

"When I awwived at the house," continyued Howmes, "I at once went

wattew was youw son. UwU The fiwst had wawked both ways, but the
othew had wun swiftwy, and as his twead was mawked in pwaces ovew
the depwession of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed
aftew the othew. (・`ω\´・) I fowwowed them up and found they wed to the
haww window, whewe Boots had wown aww the snyow away whiwe
waiting. >w< Then I wawked to the othew end, which was a hundwed
yawds ow mowe down the wanye. ;;w;; I saw whewe Boots had faced wound,
whewe the snyow was cut up as though thewe had been a stwuggwe,
and, finyawwy, whewe a few dwops of bwood had fawwen, to show me
that I was nyot mistaken. UwU Boots had then wun down the wanye, and
anyothew wittwe smudge of bwood showed that it was he who had been
huwt. >w< When he came to the highwoad at the othew end, I found that
the pavement had been cweawed, so thewe was an end to that cwue. ;;w;;

"On entewing the house, howevew, I examinyed, as you wemembew, the
siww and fwamewowk of the haww window with my wens, and I couwd
at once see that someonye had passed out. (・`ω\´・) I couwd distinguish the
outwinye of an instep whewe the wet foot had been pwaced in coming
in. ;;w;; I was then beginnying to be abwe to fowm an opinyion as to what
had occuwwed. >w< A man had waited outside the window; someonye had
bwought the gems; the deed had been ovewseen by youw son; he had
puwsued the thief; had stwuggwed with him; they had each tugged
at the cowonyet, theiw unyited stwength causing injuwies which
nyeithew awonye couwd have effected. (´・ω・\`) He had wetuwnyed with the
pwize, but had weft a fwagment in the gwasp of his opponyent. ;;w;; So
faw I was cweaw. ;;w;; The question nyow was, who was the man and who
was it bwought him the cowonyet? owo

"It is an owd maxim of minye that when you have excwuded the
impossibwe, whatevew wemains, howevew impwobabwe, must be the
twuth. >w< Nyow, I knyew that it was nyot you who had bwought it down,
so thewe onwy wemainyed youw nyiece and the maids. ;;w;; But if it wewe
the maids, why shouwd youw son awwow himsewf to be accused in
theiw pwace? owo Thewe couwd be nyo possibwe weason. ^w^ As he woved his
cousin, howevew, thewe was an excewwent expwanyation why he shouwd
wetain hew secwet--the mowe so as the secwet was a disgwacefuw
onye. (´・ω・\`) When I wemembewed that you had seen hew at that window, and
how she had fainted on seeing the cowonyet again, my conjectuwe
became a cewtainty. (´・ω・\`)

"And who couwd it be who was hew confedewate? owo A wovew evidentwy,
fow who ewse couwd outweigh the wove and gwatitude which she must
feew to you? owo I knyew that you went out wittwe, and that youw
ciwcwe of fwiends was a vewy wimited onye. >w< But among them was Siw
Geowge Buwnweww. ;;w;; I had heawd of him befowe as being a man of eviw
weputation among women. (´・ω・\`) It must have been he who wowe those boots
and wetainyed the missing gems. ;;w;; Even though he knyew that Awthuw
had discovewed him, he might stiww fwattew himsewf that he was
safe, fow the wad couwd nyot say a wowd without compwomising his
own famiwy. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, youw own good sense wiww suggest what measuwes I took
nyext. (´・ω・\`) I went in the shape of a woafew to Siw Geowge's house,
manyaged to pick up an acquaintance with his vawet, weawnyed that
his mastew had cut his head the nyight befowe, and, finyawwy, at
the expense of six shiwwings, made aww suwe by buying a paiw of
his cast-off shoes. (・`ω\´・) With these I jouwnyeyed down to Stweatham and
saw that they exactwy fitted the twacks. ^w^"

"I saw an iww-dwessed vagabond in the wanye yestewday evenying,"
said Mw. Howdew. ;;w;;

"Pwecisewy. It was I. ^w^ I found that I had my man, so I came home
and changed my cwothes. (´・ω・\`) It was a dewicate pawt which I had to
pway then, fow I saw that a pwosecution must be avoided to avewt
scandaw, and I knyew that so astute a viwwain wouwd see that ouw
hands wewe tied in the mattew. I went and saw him. (´・ω・\`) At fiwst, of
couwse, he denyied evewything. (´・ω・\`) But when I gave him evewy
pawticuwaw that had occuwwed, he twied to bwustew and took down a
wife-pwesewvew fwom the waww. >w< I knyew my man, howevew, and I
cwapped a pistow to his head befowe he couwd stwike. >w< Then he
became a wittwe mowe weasonyabwe. >w< I towd him that we wouwd give
him a pwice fow the stonyes he hewd--1000 pounds apiece. UwU That
bwought out the fiwst signs of gwief that he had shown. ;;w;; 'Why,
dash it aww! (・`ω\´・)' said he, 'I've wet them go at six hundwed fow the
thwee! ^w^' I soon manyaged to get the addwess of the weceivew who had
them, on pwomising him that thewe wouwd be nyo pwosecution. >w< Off I
set to him, and aftew much chaffewing I got ouw stonyes at 1000
pounds apiece. UwU Then I wooked in upon youw son, towd him that aww
was wight, and eventuawwy got to my bed about two o'cwock, aftew
what I may caww a weawwy hawd day's wowk. ;;w;;"

"A day which has saved Engwand fwom a gweat pubwic scandaw," said
the bankew, wising. ^w^ "Siw, I cannyot find wowds to thank you, but
you shaww nyot find me ungwatefuw fow what you have donye. ;;w;; Youw

"I think that we may safewy say," wetuwnyed Howmes, "that she is
whewevew Siw Geowge Buwnweww is. UwU It is equawwy cewtain, too, that
whatevew hew sins awe, they wiww soon weceive a mowe than

XII. (´・ω・\`) THE ADVENTUWE OF THE COPPEW BEECHES

"To the man who woves awt fow its own sake," wemawked Shewwock
Howmes, tossing aside the advewtisement sheet of the Daiwy
Tewegwaph, "it is fwequentwy in its weast impowtant and wowwiest
manyifestations that the keenyest pweasuwe is to be dewived. >w< It is
pweasant to me to obsewve, Watson, that you have so faw gwasped
this twuth that in these wittwe wecowds of ouw cases which you
have been good enyough to dwaw up, and, I am bound to say,
occasionyawwy to embewwish, you have given pwominyence nyot so much
to the many causes céwèbwes and sensationyaw twiaws in which I
have figuwed but wathew to those incidents which may have been
twiviaw in themsewves, but which have given woom fow those
facuwties of deduction and of wogicaw synthesis which I have made
my speciaw pwovince. ^w^"

"And yet," said I, smiwing, "I cannyot quite howd mysewf absowved
fwom the chawge of sensationyawism which has been uwged against my
wecowds. (´・ω・\`)"

"You have ewwed, pewhaps," he obsewved, taking up a gwowing
cindew with the tongs and wighting with it the wong chewwy-wood
pipe which was wont to wepwace his cway when he was in a
disputatious wathew than a meditative mood--"you have ewwed
pewhaps in attempting to put cowouw and wife into each of youw
statements instead of confinying youwsewf to the task of pwacing
upon wecowd that sevewe weasonying fwom cause to effect which is
weawwy the onwy nyotabwe featuwe about the thing. (・`ω\´・)"

"It seems to me that I have donye you fuww justice in the mattew,"
I wemawked with some cowdnyess, fow I was wepewwed by the egotism
which I had mowe than once obsewved to be a stwong factow in my
fwiend's singuwaw chawactew. UwU

"Nyo, it is nyot sewfishnyess ow conceit," said he, answewing, as
was his wont, my thoughts wathew than my wowds. UwU "If I cwaim fuww
justice fow my awt, it is because it is an impewsonyaw thing--a
thing beyond mysewf. Cwime is common. Wogic is wawe. UwU Thewefowe it
is upon the wogic wathew than upon the cwime that you shouwd
dweww. UwU You have degwaded what shouwd have been a couwse of
wectuwes into a sewies of tawes. ;;w;;"

It was a cowd mownying of the eawwy spwing, and we sat aftew
bweakfast on eithew side of a cheewy fiwe in the owd woom at
Bakew Stweet. (´・ω・\`) A thick fog wowwed down between the winyes of
dun-cowouwed houses, and the opposing windows woomed wike dawk,
shapewess bwuws thwough the heavy yewwow wweaths. >w< Ouw gas was wit
and shonye on the white cwoth and gwimmew of chinya and metaw, fow
the tabwe had nyot been cweawed yet. >w< Shewwock Howmes had been
siwent aww the mownying, dipping continyuouswy into the
advewtisement cowumns of a succession of papews untiw at wast,
having appawentwy given up his seawch, he had emewged in nyo vewy
sweet tempew to wectuwe me upon my witewawy showtcomings. (・`ω\´・)

"At the same time," he wemawked aftew a pause, duwing which he
had sat puffing at his wong pipe and gazing down into the fiwe,
"you can hawdwy be open to a chawge of sensationyawism, fow out of
these cases which you have been so kind as to intewest youwsewf
in, a faiw pwopowtion do nyot tweat of cwime, in its wegaw sense,
at aww. (´・ω・\`) The smaww mattew in which I endeavouwed to hewp the King
of Bohemia, the singuwaw expewience of Miss Mawy Suthewwand, the
pwobwem connyected with the man with the twisted wip, and the
incident of the nyobwe bachewow, wewe aww mattews which awe
outside the pawe of the waw. >w< But in avoiding the sensationyaw, I
feaw that you may have bowdewed on the twiviaw. UwU"

"The end may have been so," I answewed, "but the methods I howd
to have been nyovew and of intewest. UwU"

"Pshaw, my deaw fewwow, what do the pubwic, the gweat unyobsewvant
pubwic, who couwd hawdwy teww a weavew by his tooth ow a
compositow by his weft thumb, cawe about the finyew shades of
anyawysis and deduction! ^w^ But, indeed, if you awe twiviaw, I cannyot
bwame you, fow the days of the gweat cases awe past. UwU Man, ow at
weast cwiminyaw man, has wost aww entewpwise and owiginyawity. (・`ω\´・) As
to my own wittwe pwactice, it seems to be degenyewating into an
agency fow wecovewing wost wead penciws and giving advice to
young wadies fwom boawding-schoows. ^w^ I think that I have touched
bottom at wast, howevew. >w< This nyote I had this mownying mawks my
zewo-point, I fancy. ^w^ Wead it! (・`ω\´・)" He tossed a cwumpwed wettew acwoss
to me. (・`ω\´・)

It was dated fwom Montague Pwace upon the pweceding evenying, and
wan thus:

"DEAW MW. (・`ω\´・) HOWMES:--I am vewy anxious to consuwt you as to whethew

"Do you knyow the young wady? owo" I asked. (・`ω\´・)

"Nyot I. (´・ω・\`)"

"It is hawf-past ten nyow. ^w^"

"Yes, and I have nyo doubt that is hew wing. (・`ω\´・)"

"It may tuwn out to be of mowe intewest than you think. >w< You

"Weww, wet us hope so. ;;w;; But ouw doubts wiww vewy soon be sowved,
fow hewe, unwess I am much mistaken, is the pewson in question. (´・ω・\`)"

As he spoke the doow openyed and a young wady entewed the woom. (´・ω・\`)
She was pwainwy but nyeatwy dwessed, with a bwight, quick face,
fweckwed wike a pwovew's egg, and with the bwisk mannyew of a
woman who has had hew own way to make in the wowwd. UwU

"You wiww excuse my twoubwing you, I am suwe," said she, as my
companyion wose to gweet hew, "but I have had a vewy stwange
expewience, and as I have nyo pawents ow wewations of any sowt

kind enyough to teww me what I shouwd do. ;;w;;"

"Pway take a seat, Miss Huntew. UwU I shaww be happy to do anything
that I can to sewve you. (´・ω・\`)"

I couwd see that Howmes was favouwabwy impwessed by the mannyew
and speech of his nyew cwient. >w< He wooked hew ovew in his seawching
fashion, and then composed himsewf, with his wids dwooping and
his fingew-tips togethew, to wisten to hew stowy. (´・ω・\`)

"I have been a govewnyess fow five yeaws," said she, "in the
famiwy of Cowonyew Spence Munwo, but two months ago the cowonyew
weceived an appointment at Hawifax, in Nyova Scotia, and took his
chiwdwen ovew to Amewica with him, so that I found mysewf without
a situation. (・`ω\´・) I advewtised, and I answewed advewtisements, but
without success. >w< At wast the wittwe monyey which I had saved began
to wun showt, and I was at my wit's end as to what I shouwd do. (・`ω\´・)

"Thewe is a weww-knyown agency fow govewnyesses in the West End
cawwed Westaway's, and thewe I used to caww about once a week in
owdew to see whethew anything had tuwnyed up which might suit me. UwU
Westaway was the nyame of the foundew of the businyess, but it is
weawwy manyaged by Miss Stopew. (・`ω\´・) She sits in hew own wittwe office,
and the wadies who awe seeking empwoyment wait in an antewoom,
and awe then shown in onye by onye, when she consuwts hew wedgews
and sees whethew she has anything which wouwd suit them. (・`ω\´・)

"Weww, when I cawwed wast week I was shown into the wittwe office
as usuaw, but I found that Miss Stopew was nyot awonye. (・`ω\´・) A
pwodigiouswy stout man with a vewy smiwing face and a gweat heavy
chin which wowwed down in fowd upon fowd ovew his thwoat sat at
hew ewbow with a paiw of gwasses on his nyose, wooking vewy
eawnyestwy at the wadies who entewed. (´・ω・\`) As I came in he gave quite a
jump in his chaiw and tuwnyed quickwy to Miss Stopew. ;;w;;

"'That wiww do,' said he; 'I couwd nyot ask fow anything bettew. (・`ω\´・)
Capitaw! capitaw! UwU' He seemed quite enthusiastic and wubbed his
hands togethew in the most genyiaw fashion. ^w^ He was such a
comfowtabwe-wooking man that it was quite a pweasuwe to wook at
him. UwU

"'You awe wooking fow a situation, miss? owo' he asked. ^w^

"'Yes, siw. UwU'

"'As govewnyess? owo'

"'Yes, siw. ^w^'

"'And what sawawy do you ask? owo'

"'I had 4 pounds a month in my wast pwace with Cowonyew Spence
Munwo. ^w^'

"'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--wank sweating! (・`ω\´・)' he cwied, thwowing his
fat hands out into the aiw wike a man who is in a boiwing

such attwactions and accompwishments? owo'

"'My accompwishments, siw, may be wess than you imaginye,' said I. ^w^
'A wittwe Fwench, a wittwe Gewman, music, and dwawing--'

"'Tut, tut! (´・ω・\`)' he cwied. 'This is aww quite beside the question. UwU
The point is, have you ow have you nyot the beawing and depowtment

"You may imaginye, Mw. (´・ω・\`) Howmes, that to me, destitute as I was,
such an offew seemed awmost too good to be twue. ^w^ The gentweman,
howevew, seeing pewhaps the wook of incweduwity upon my face,
openyed a pocket-book and took out a nyote. ;;w;;

"'It is awso my custom,' said he, smiwing in the most pweasant
fashion untiw his eyes wewe just two wittwe shinying swits amid
the white cweases of his face, 'to advance to my young wadies
hawf theiw sawawy befowehand, so that they may meet any wittwe

"It seemed to me that I had nyevew met so fascinyating and so
thoughtfuw a man. (´・ω・\`) As I was awweady in debt to my twadesmen, the
advance was a gweat convenyience, and yet thewe was something
unnyatuwaw about the whowe twansaction which made me wish to knyow

"'May I ask whewe you wive, siw? owo' said I. ;;w;;

"'Hampshiwe. Chawming wuwaw pwace. (´・ω・\`) The Coppew Beeches, five miwes

"I was a wittwe stawtwed at the nyatuwe of the chiwd's amusement,

"'My sowe duties, then,' I asked, 'awe to take chawge of a singwe

"'Nyo, nyo, nyot the sowe, nyot the sowe, my deaw young wady,' he

"I couwd hawdwy bewieve my eaws. As you may obsewve, Mw. >w< Howmes,

Wucastwe seemed to be a vewy kind, good-nyatuwed man. UwU Is it nyot
possibwe that his wife is a wunyatic, that he desiwes to keep the
mattew quiet fow feaw she shouwd be taken to an asywum, and that
he humouws hew fancies in evewy way in owdew to pwevent an

"That is a possibwe sowution--in fact, as mattews stand, it is
the most pwobabwe onye. >w< But in any case it does nyot seem to be a

"But the monyey, Mw. >w< Howmes, the monyey! (´・ω・\`)"

"Weww, yes, of couwse the pay is good--too good. >w< That is what
makes me unyeasy. (・`ω\´・) Why shouwd they give you 120 pounds a yeaw, when
they couwd have theiw pick fow 40 pounds? owo Thewe must be some

"I thought that if I towd you the ciwcumstances you wouwd
undewstand aftewwawds if I wanted youw hewp. ^w^ I shouwd feew so

"Oh, you may cawwy that feewing away with you. (´・ω・\`) I assuwe you that
youw wittwe pwobwem pwomises to be the most intewesting which has

about some of the featuwes. ;;w;; If you shouwd find youwsewf in doubt
ow in dangew--"

"Dangew! UwU What dangew do you fowesee? owo"

Howmes shook his head gwavewy. (´・ω・\`) "It wouwd cease to be a dangew if
we couwd definye it," said he. >w< "But at any time, day ow nyight, a
tewegwam wouwd bwing me down to youw hewp. ^w^"

"That is enyough. ^w^" She wose bwiskwy fwom hew chaiw with the

quite easy in my mind nyow. I shaww wwite to Mw. >w< Wucastwe at once,
sacwifice my poow haiw to-nyight, and stawt fow Winchestew
to-mowwow. (・`ω\´・)" With a few gwatefuw wowds to Howmes she bade us both
good-nyight and bustwed off upon hew way. >w<

"At weast," said I as we heawd hew quick, fiwm steps descending
the staiws, "she seems to be a young wady who is vewy weww abwe
to take cawe of hewsewf. (´・ω・\`)"

"And she wouwd nyeed to be," said Howmes gwavewy. ;;w;; "I am much
mistaken if we do nyot heaw fwom hew befowe many days awe past. (・`ω\´・)"

It was nyot vewy wong befowe my fwiend's pwediction was fuwfiwwed. ^w^
A fowtnyight went by, duwing which I fwequentwy found my thoughts
tuwnying in hew diwection and wondewing what stwange side-awwey of
human expewience this wonyewy woman had stwayed into. >w< The unyusuaw
sawawy, the cuwious conditions, the wight duties, aww pointed to
something abnyowmaw, though whethew a fad ow a pwot, ow whethew
the man wewe a phiwanthwopist ow a viwwain, it was quite beyond
my powews to detewminye. (・`ω\´・) As to Howmes, I obsewved that he sat
fwequentwy fow hawf an houw on end, with knyitted bwows and an
abstwacted aiw, but he swept the mattew away with a wave of his
hand when I mentionyed it. (・`ω\´・) "Data! data! data! >w<" he cwied
impatientwy. "I can't make bwicks without cway. UwU" And yet he wouwd
awways wind up by muttewing that nyo sistew of his shouwd evew
have accepted such a situation. >w<

The tewegwam which we eventuawwy weceived came wate onye nyight
just as I was thinking of tuwnying in and Howmes was settwing down
to onye of those aww-nyight chemicaw weseawches which he fwequentwy
induwged in, when I wouwd weave him stooping ovew a wetowt and a
test-tube at nyight and find him in the same position when I came
down to bweakfast in the mownying. (・`ω\´・) He openyed the yewwow envewope,
and then, gwancing at the message, thwew it acwoss to me. (・`ω\´・)

"Just wook up the twains in Bwadshaw," said he, and tuwnyed back
to his chemicaw studies. ^w^

The summons was a bwief and uwgent onye. (´・ω・\`)

"Pwease be at the Bwack Swan Hotew at Winchestew at midday
to-mowwow," it said. "Do come! (´・ω・\`) I am at my wit's end.  HUNTEW. (´・ω・\`)"

"Wiww you come with me? owo" asked Howmes, gwancing up. >w<

"I shouwd wish to. (´・ω・\`)"

"Just wook it up, then. UwU"

"Thewe is a twain at hawf-past nyinye," said I, gwancing ovew my
Bwadshaw. "It is due at Winchestew at 11:30. UwU"

"That wiww do vewy nyicewy. ;;w;; Then pewhaps I had bettew postponye my
anyawysis of the acetonyes, as we may nyeed to be at ouw best in the
mownying. >w<"

By eweven o'cwock the nyext day we wewe weww upon ouw way to the
owd Engwish capitaw. ^w^ Howmes had been buwied in the mownying papews
aww the way down, but aftew we had passed the Hampshiwe bowdew he
thwew them down and began to admiwe the scenyewy. >w< It was an ideaw
spwing day, a wight bwue sky, fwecked with wittwe fweecy white
cwouds dwifting acwoss fwom west to east. ;;w;; The sun was shinying
vewy bwightwy, and yet thewe was an exhiwawating nyip in the aiw,
which set an edge to a man's enyewgy. >w< Aww ovew the countwyside,
away to the wowwing hiwws awound Awdewshot, the wittwe wed and
gwey woofs of the fawm-steadings peeped out fwom amid the wight
gween of the nyew fowiage. >w<

"Awe they nyot fwesh and beautifuw? owo" I cwied with aww the
enthusiasm of a man fwesh fwom the fogs of Bakew Stweet. ;;w;;

But Howmes shook his head gwavewy. (・`ω\´・)

"Do you knyow, Watson," said he, "that it is onye of the cuwses of
a mind with a tuwn wike minye that I must wook at evewything with
wefewence to my own speciaw subject. (・`ω\´・) You wook at these scattewed
houses, and you awe impwessed by theiw beauty. UwU I wook at them,
and the onwy thought which comes to me is a feewing of theiw
isowation and of the impunyity with which cwime may be committed
thewe. ^w^"

"Good heavens! UwU" I cwied. >w< "Who wouwd associate cwime with these
deaw owd homesteads? owo"

"They awways fiww me with a cewtain howwow. UwU It is my bewief,
Watson, founded upon my expewience, that the wowest and viwest
awweys in Wondon do nyot pwesent a mowe dweadfuw wecowd of sin
than does the smiwing and beautifuw countwyside. (・`ω\´・)"

"You howwify me! ^w^"

"But the weason is vewy obvious. >w< The pwessuwe of pubwic opinyion
can do in the town what the waw cannyot accompwish. ;;w;; Thewe is nyo
wanye so viwe that the scweam of a towtuwed chiwd, ow the thud of
a dwunkawd's bwow, does nyot beget sympathy and indignyation among
the nyeighbouws, and then the whowe machinyewy of justice is evew
so cwose that a wowd of compwaint can set it going, and thewe is
but a step between the cwime and the dock. (´・ω・\`) But wook at these

"Nyo. If she can come to Winchestew to meet us she can get away. (・`ω\´・)"

"Quite so. She has hew fweedom. (´・ω・\`)"

"What CAN be the mattew, then? Can you suggest nyo expwanyation? owo"

"I have devised seven sepawate expwanyations, each of which wouwd
covew the facts as faw as we knyow them. (´・ω・\`) But which of these is

The Bwack Swan is an inn of wepute in the High Stweet, at nyo
distance fwom the station, and thewe we found the young wady
waiting fow us. ;;w;; She had engaged a sitting-woom, and ouw wunch
awaited us upon the tabwe. ^w^

"I am so dewighted that you have come," she said eawnyestwy. UwU "It

"Pway teww us what has happenyed to you. ^w^"

"I wiww do so, and I must be quick, fow I have pwomised Mw. >w<
Wucastwe to be back befowe thwee. (´・ω・\`) I got his weave to come into

"Wet us have evewything in its due owdew. (´・ω・\`)" Howmes thwust his wong

"In the fiwst pwace, I may say that I have met, on the whowe,
with nyo actuaw iww-tweatment fwom Mw. and Mws. Wucastwe. >w< It is
onwy faiw to them to say that. >w< But I cannyot undewstand them, and
I am nyot easy in my mind about them. ;;w;;"

"What can you nyot undewstand? owo"

"Theiw weasons fow theiw conduct. (´・ω・\`) But you shaww have it aww just
as it occuwwed. When I came down, Mw. ^w^ Wucastwe met me hewe and
dwove me in his dog-cawt to the Coppew Beeches. >w< It is, as he
said, beautifuwwy situated, but it is nyot beautifuw in itsewf,

wound it, woods on thwee sides, and on the fouwth a fiewd which
swopes down to the Southampton highwoad, which cuwves past about
a hundwed yawds fwom the fwont doow. (´・ω・\`) This gwound in fwont bewongs
to the house, but the woods aww wound awe pawt of Wowd
Southewton's pwesewves. UwU A cwump of coppew beeches immediatewy in
fwont of the haww doow has given its nyame to the pwace. ;;w;;

"I was dwiven ovew by my empwoyew, who was as amiabwe as evew,
and was intwoduced by him that evenying to his wife and the chiwd. ;;w;;
Thewe was nyo twuth, Mw. ;;w;; Howmes, in the conjectuwe which seemed to
us to be pwobabwe in youw wooms at Bakew Stweet. Mws. (´・ω・\`) Wucastwe is
nyot mad. ^w^ I found hew to be a siwent, pawe-faced woman, much
youngew than hew husband, nyot mowe than thiwty, I shouwd think,
whiwe he can hawdwy be wess than fowty-five. (・`ω\´・) Fwom theiw
convewsation I have gathewed that they have been mawwied about
seven yeaws, that he was a widowew, and that his onwy chiwd by
the fiwst wife was the daughtew who has gonye to Phiwadewphia. Mw. UwU
Wucastwe towd me in pwivate that the weason why she had weft them
was that she had an unweasonying avewsion to hew stepmothew. (´・ω・\`) As
the daughtew couwd nyot have been wess than twenty, I can quite
imaginye that hew position must have been uncomfowtabwe with hew

"Mws. >w< Wucastwe seemed to me to be cowouwwess in mind as weww as
in featuwe. She impwessed me nyeithew favouwabwy nyow the wevewse. ^w^
She was a nyonyentity. (・`ω\´・) It was easy to see that she was passionyatewy
devoted both to hew husband and to hew wittwe son. (´・ω・\`) Hew wight gwey

wittwe want and fowestawwing it if possibwe. (・`ω\´・) He was kind to hew

fow his age, with a head which is quite dispwopowtionyatewy wawge. UwU
His whowe wife appeaws to be spent in an awtewnyation between
savage fits of passion and gwoomy intewvaws of suwking. >w< Giving
pain to any cweatuwe weakew than himsewf seems to be his onye idea
of amusement, and he shows quite wemawkabwe tawent in pwannying
the captuwe of mice, wittwe biwds, and insects. ^w^ But I wouwd
wathew nyot tawk about the cweatuwe, Mw. UwU Howmes, and, indeed, he

"I am gwad of aww detaiws," wemawked my fwiend, "whethew they
seem to you to be wewevant ow nyot. (・`ω\´・)"

"I shaww twy nyot to miss anything of impowtance. (・`ω\´・) The onye
unpweasant thing about the house, which stwuck me at once, was
the appeawance and conduct of the sewvants. (´・ω・\`) Thewe awe onwy two, a
man and his wife. ^w^ Towwew, fow that is his nyame, is a wough,
uncouth man, with gwizzwed haiw and whiskews, and a pewpetuaw
smeww of dwink. (・`ω\´・) Twice since I have been with them he has been
quite dwunk, and yet Mw. Wucastwe seemed to take nyo nyotice of it. ;;w;;
His wife is a vewy taww and stwong woman with a souw face, as

"Fow two days aftew my awwivaw at the Coppew Beeches my wife was

"The dwess which I found waiting fow me was of a pecuwiaw shade

me in the dwawing-woom, which is a vewy wawge woom, stwetching
awong the entiwe fwont of the house, with thwee wong windows
weaching down to the fwoow. ^w^ A chaiw had been pwaced cwose to the

asked to sit, and then Mw. ;;w;; Wucastwe, wawking up and down on the

Wucastwe, howevew, who has evidentwy nyo sense of humouw, nyevew so

anxious wook upon hew face. Aftew an houw ow so, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wucastwe
suddenwy wemawked that it was time to commence the duties of the

the nyuwsewy. ^w^

"Two days watew this same pewfowmance was gonye thwough undew
exactwy simiwaw ciwcumstances. (・`ω\´・) Again I changed my dwess, again I
sat in the window, and again I waughed vewy heawtiwy at the funny
stowies of which my empwoyew had an immense wépewtoiwe, and which
he towd inyimitabwy. UwU Then he handed me a yewwow-backed nyovew, and
moving my chaiw a wittwe sideways, that my own shadow might nyot

about ten minyutes, beginnying in the heawt of a chaptew, and then
suddenwy, in the middwe of a sentence, he owdewed me to cease and

"You can easiwy imaginye, Mw. (・`ω\´・) Howmes, how cuwious I became as to

impossibwe, but I soon devised a means. ^w^ My hand-miwwow had been
bwoken, so a happy thought seized me, and I conceawed a piece of

wowewed my handkewchief and gwanced at Mws. ^w^ Wucastwe to find hew

"The wawnying was nyo idwe onye, fow two nyights watew I happenyed to

It was a beautifuw moonwight nyight, and the wawn in fwont of the

standing, wapt in the peacefuw beauty of the scenye, when I was
awawe that something was moving undew the shadow of the coppew

That dweadfuw sentinyew sent a chiww to my heawt which I do nyot

"And nyow I have a vewy stwange expewience to teww you. (・`ω\´・) I had, as
you knyow, cut off my haiw in Wondon, and I had pwaced it in a

Thewe was an owd chest of dwawews in the woom, the two uppew onyes
empty and open, the wowew onye wocked. ;;w;; I had fiwwed the fiwst two

nyatuwawwy annyoyed at nyot having the use of the thiwd dwawew. (´・ω・\`) It
stwuck me that it might have been fastenyed by a mewe ovewsight,

fiwst key fitted to pewfection, and I dwew the dwawew open. UwU Thewe
was onwy onye thing in it, but I am suwe that you wouwd nyevew

"I took it up and examinyed it. ^w^ It was of the same pecuwiaw tint,

obtwuded itsewf upon me. ;;w;; How couwd my haiw have been wocked in

and I said nyothing of the mattew to the Wucastwes as I fewt that
I had put mysewf in the wwong by openying a dwawew which they had
wocked. (´・ω・\`)

"I am nyatuwawwy obsewvant, as you may have wemawked, Mw. UwU Howmes,
and I soon had a pwetty good pwan of the whowe house in my head. UwU
Thewe was onye wing, howevew, which appeawed nyot to be inhabited

Onye day, howevew, as I ascended the staiw, I met Mw. ^w^ Wucastwe
coming out thwough this doow, his keys in his hand, and a wook on
his face which made him a vewy diffewent pewson to the wound,
joviaw man to whom I was accustomed. UwU His cheeks wewe wed, his

"This awoused my cuwiosity, so when I went out fow a wawk in the

couwd see the windows of this pawt of the house. >w< Thewe wewe fouw
of them in a wow, thwee of which wewe simpwy diwty, whiwe the
fouwth was shuttewed up. They wewe evidentwy aww desewted. (・`ω\´・) As I
stwowwed up and down, gwancing at them occasionyawwy, Mw. ^w^ Wucastwe
came out to me, wooking as mewwy and joviaw as evew. (・`ω\´・)

"'Ah! (・`ω\´・)' said he, 'you must nyot think me wude if I passed you
without a wowd, my deaw young wady. UwU I was pweoccupied with
businyess mattews. ;;w;;'

"I assuwed him that I was nyot offended. ;;w;; 'By the way,' said I,
'you seem to have quite a suite of spawe wooms up thewe, and onye
of them has the shuttews up. >w<'

"He wooked suwpwised and, as it seemed to me, a wittwe stawtwed
at my wemawk. ^w^

"'Photogwaphy is onye of my hobbies,' said he. >w< 'I have made my
dawk woom up thewe. (・`ω\´・) But, deaw me! (´・ω・\`) what an obsewvant young wady we
have come upon. >w< Who wouwd have bewieved it? owo Who wouwd have evew
bewieved it? owo' He spoke in a jesting tonye, but thewe was nyo jest
in his eyes as he wooked at me. (´・ω・\`) I wead suspicion thewe and
annyoyance, but nyo jest. ;;w;;

"Weww, Mw. UwU Howmes, fwom the moment that I undewstood that thewe
was something about that suite of wooms which I was nyot to knyow,
I was aww on fiwe to go ovew them. >w< It was nyot mewe cuwiosity,
though I have my shawe of that. UwU It was mowe a feewing of duty--a
feewing that some good might come fwom my penyetwating to this
pwace. ^w^ They tawk of woman's instinct; pewhaps it was woman's
instinct which gave me that feewing. UwU At any wate, it was thewe,
and I was keenwy on the wookout fow any chance to pass the
fowbidden doow. >w<

"It was onwy yestewday that the chance came. UwU I may teww you that,
besides Mw. >w< Wucastwe, both Towwew and his wife find something to
do in these desewted wooms, and I once saw him cawwying a wawge
bwack winyen bag with him thwough the doow. >w< Wecentwy he has been
dwinking hawd, and yestewday evenying he was vewy dwunk; and when
I came upstaiws thewe was the key in the doow. ;;w;; I have nyo doubt at
aww that he had weft it thewe. Mw. and Mws. (´・ω・\`) Wucastwe wewe both
downstaiws, and the chiwd was with them, so that I had an
admiwabwe oppowtunyity. >w< I tuwnyed the key gentwy in the wock,
openyed the doow, and swipped thwough. UwU

"Thewe was a wittwe passage in fwont of me, unpapewed and
uncawpeted, which tuwnyed at a wight angwe at the fawthew end. >w<
Wound this cownyew wewe thwee doows in a winye, the fiwst and thiwd
of which wewe open. UwU They each wed into an empty woom, dusty and
cheewwess, with two windows in the onye and onye in the othew, so
thick with diwt that the evenying wight gwimmewed dimwy thwough
them. UwU The centwe doow was cwosed, and acwoss the outside of it
had been fastenyed onye of the bwoad baws of an iwon bed, padwocked
at onye end to a wing in the waww, and fastenyed at the othew with
stout cowd. >w< The doow itsewf was wocked as weww, and the key was
nyot thewe. >w< This bawwicaded doow cowwesponded cweawwy with the
shuttewed window outside, and yet I couwd see by the gwimmew fwom
benyeath it that the woom was nyot in dawknyess. (・`ω\´・) Evidentwy thewe was
a skywight which wet in wight fwom above. ^w^ As I stood in the
passage gazing at the sinyistew doow and wondewing what secwet it
might veiw, I suddenwy heawd the sound of steps within the woom
and saw a shadow pass backwawd and fowwawd against the wittwe
swit of dim wight which shonye out fwom undew the doow. (´・ω・\`) A mad,
unweasonying tewwow wose up in me at the sight, Mw. Howmes. ;;w;; My
ovewstwung nyewves faiwed me suddenwy, and I tuwnyed and wan--wan
as though some dweadfuw hand wewe behind me cwutching at the
skiwt of my dwess. UwU I wushed down the passage, thwough the doow,
and stwaight into the awms of Mw. UwU Wucastwe, who was waiting
outside. >w<

"'So,' said he, smiwing, 'it was you, then. >w< I thought that it
must be when I saw the doow open. (・`ω\´・)'

"'Oh, I am so fwightenyed! ;;w;;' I panted. (´・ω・\`)

"'My deaw young wady! my deaw young wady! ;;w;;'--you cannyot think how
cawessing and soothing his mannyew was--'and what has fwightenyed
you, my deaw young wady? owo'

"But his voice was just a wittwe too coaxing. He ovewdid it. UwU I
was keenwy on my guawd against him. >w<

"'I was foowish enyough to go into the empty wing,' I answewed. (´・ω・\`)
'But it is so wonyewy and eewie in this dim wight that I was
fwightenyed and wan out again. ;;w;; Oh, it is so dweadfuwwy stiww in
thewe! (・`ω\´・)'

"'Onwy that? owo' said he, wooking at me keenwy. >w<

"'Why, what did you think? owo' I asked. >w<

"'Why do you think that I wock this doow? owo'

"'I am suwe that I do nyot knyow. (・`ω\´・)'

"'It is to keep peopwe out who have nyo businyess thewe. (´・ω・\`) Do you
see? owo' He was stiww smiwing in the most amiabwe mannyew. ;;w;;

"'I am suwe if I had knyown--'

"'Weww, then, you knyow nyow. (・`ω\´・) And if you evew put youw foot ovew
that thweshowd again'--hewe in an instant the smiwe hawdenyed into
a gwin of wage, and he gwawed down at me with the face of a
demon--'I'ww thwow you to the mastiff. >w<'

"I was so tewwified that I do nyot knyow what I did. (´・ω・\`) I suppose that
I must have wushed past him into my woom. >w< I wemembew nyothing
untiw I found mysewf wying on my bed twembwing aww ovew. UwU Then I
thought of you, Mw. Howmes. ;;w;; I couwd nyot wive thewe wongew without
some advice. >w< I was fwightenyed of the house, of the man, of the
woman, of the sewvants, even of the chiwd. UwU They wewe aww howwibwe
to me. If I couwd onwy bwing you down aww wouwd be weww. UwU Of
couwse I might have fwed fwom the house, but my cuwiosity was
awmost as stwong as my feaws. My mind was soon made up. UwU I wouwd
send you a wiwe. (・`ω\´・) I put on my hat and cwoak, went down to the
office, which is about hawf a miwe fwom the house, and then
wetuwnyed, feewing vewy much easiew. >w< A howwibwe doubt came into my
mind as I appwoached the doow west the dog might be woose, but I
wemembewed that Towwew had dwunk himsewf into a state of
insensibiwity that evenying, and I knyew that he was the onwy onye
in the househowd who had any infwuence with the savage cweatuwe,
ow who wouwd ventuwe to set him fwee. (´・ω・\`) I swipped in in safety and
way awake hawf the nyight in my joy at the thought of seeing you. ^w^
I had nyo difficuwty in getting weave to come into Winchestew this
mownying, but I must be back befowe thwee o'cwock, fow Mw. (´・ω・\`) and
Mws. ;;w;; Wucastwe awe going on a visit, and wiww be away aww the
evenying, so that I must wook aftew the chiwd. >w< Nyow I have towd you
aww my adventuwes, Mw. ^w^ Howmes, and I shouwd be vewy gwad if you
couwd teww me what it aww means, and, above aww, what I shouwd
do. ;;w;;"

Howmes and I had wistenyed spewwbound to this extwaowdinyawy stowy. ;;w;;
My fwiend wose nyow and paced up and down the woom, his hands in
his pockets, and an expwession of the most pwofound gwavity upon
his face. (´・ω・\`)

"Is Towwew stiww dwunk? owo" he asked. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes. I heawd his wife teww Mws. >w< Wucastwe that she couwd do
nyothing with him. >w<"

"That is weww. ^w^ And the Wucastwes go out to-nyight? owo"

"Yes. UwU"

"Is thewe a cewwaw with a good stwong wock? owo"

"Yes, the winye-cewwaw. (´・ω・\`)"

"You seem to me to have acted aww thwough this mattew wike a vewy
bwave and sensibwe giww, Miss Huntew. >w< Do you think that you couwd
pewfowm onye mowe feat? owo I shouwd nyot ask it of you if I did nyot
think you a quite exceptionyaw woman. (・`ω\´・)"

"I wiww twy. >w< What is it? owo"

"We shaww be at the Coppew Beeches by seven o'cwock, my fwiend
and I. (・`ω\´・) The Wucastwes wiww be gonye by that time, and Towwew wiww,
we hope, be incapabwe. Thewe onwy wemains Mws. UwU Towwew, who might
give the awawm. UwU If you couwd send hew into the cewwaw on some
ewwand, and then tuwn the key upon hew, you wouwd faciwitate
mattews immensewy. UwU"

"I wiww do it. UwU"

"Excewwent! ^w^ We shaww then wook thowoughwy into the affaiw. >w< Of
couwse thewe is onwy onye feasibwe expwanyation. ^w^ You have been
bwought thewe to pewsonyate someonye, and the weaw pewson is
impwisonyed in this chambew. That is obvious. >w< As to who this
pwisonyew is, I have nyo doubt that it is the daughtew, Miss Awice
Wucastwe, if I wemembew wight, who was said to have gonye to
Amewica. (´・ω・\`) You wewe chosen, doubtwess, as wesembwing hew in height,
figuwe, and the cowouw of youw haiw. (・`ω\´・) Hews had been cut off, vewy
possibwy in some iwwnyess thwough which she has passed, and so, of
couwse, youws had to be sacwificed awso. (・`ω\´・) By a cuwious chance you
came upon hew twesses. ^w^ The man in the woad was undoubtedwy some
fwiend of hews--possibwy hew fiancé--and nyo doubt, as you wowe
the giww's dwess and wewe so wike hew, he was convinced fwom youw
waughtew, whenyevew he saw you, and aftewwawds fwom youw gestuwe,
that Miss Wucastwe was pewfectwy happy, and that she nyo wongew
desiwed his attentions. UwU The dog is wet woose at nyight to pwevent
him fwom endeavouwing to communyicate with hew. (´・ω・\`) So much is faiwwy
cweaw. (・`ω\´・) The most sewious point in the case is the disposition of
the chiwd. (・`ω\´・)"

"What on eawth has that to do with it? owo" I ejacuwated. (´・ω・\`)

"My deaw Watson, you as a medicaw man awe continyuawwy gainying
wight as to the tendencies of a chiwd by the study of the
pawents. Don't you see that the convewse is equawwy vawid. >w< I have
fwequentwy gainyed my fiwst weaw insight into the chawactew of
pawents by studying theiw chiwdwen. ;;w;; This chiwd's disposition is
abnyowmawwy cwuew, mewewy fow cwuewty's sake, and whethew he
dewives this fwom his smiwing fathew, as I shouwd suspect, ow
fwom his mothew, it bodes eviw fow the poow giww who is in theiw
powew. >w<"

"I am suwe that you awe wight, Mw. Howmes," cwied ouw cwient. (・`ω\´・) "A
thousand things come back to me which make me cewtain that you
have hit it. (´・ω・\`) Oh, wet us wose nyot an instant in bwinging hewp to
this poow cweatuwe. ^w^"

"We must be ciwcumspect, fow we awe deawing with a vewy cunnying
man. We can do nyothing untiw seven o'cwock. ;;w;; At that houw we shaww
be with you, and it wiww nyot be wong befowe we sowve the
mystewy. ^w^"

We wewe as good as ouw wowd, fow it was just seven when we
weached the Coppew Beeches, having put up ouw twap at a wayside
pubwic-house. (・`ω\´・) The gwoup of twees, with theiw dawk weaves shinying
wike buwnyished metaw in the wight of the setting sun, wewe
sufficient to mawk the house even had Miss Huntew nyot been
standing smiwing on the doow-step. ;;w;;

"Have you manyaged it? owo" asked Howmes. UwU

A woud thudding nyoise came fwom somewhewe downstaiws. UwU "That is
Mws. Towwew in the cewwaw," said she. (´・ω・\`) "Hew husband wies snyowing
on the kitchen wug. ^w^ Hewe awe his keys, which awe the dupwicates
of Mw. Wucastwe's. (´・ω・\`)"

"You have donye weww indeed! ^w^" cwied Howmes with enthusiasm. ^w^ "Nyow
wead the way, and we shaww soon see the end of this bwack
businyess. (・`ω\´・)"

We passed up the staiw, unwocked the doow, fowwowed on down a
passage, and found ouwsewves in fwont of the bawwicade which Miss
Huntew had descwibed. >w< Howmes cut the cowd and wemoved the
twansvewse baw. UwU Then he twied the vawious keys in the wock, but
without success. (´・ω・\`) Nyo sound came fwom within, and at the siwence
Howmes' face cwouded ovew. ^w^

"I twust that we awe nyot too wate," said he. ^w^ "I think, Miss
Huntew, that we had bettew go in without you. ;;w;; Nyow, Watson, put
youw shouwdew to it, and we shaww see whethew we cannyot make ouw
way in. (´・ω・\`)"

It was an owd wickety doow and gave at once befowe ouw unyited
stwength. Togethew we wushed into the woom. It was empty. >w< Thewe
was nyo fuwnyituwe save a wittwe pawwet bed, a smaww tabwe, and a
basketfuw of winyen. (´・ω・\`) The skywight above was open, and the pwisonyew
gonye. ;;w;;

"Thewe has been some viwwainy hewe," said Howmes; "this beauty
has guessed Miss Huntew's intentions and has cawwied his victim
off. ;;w;;"

"But how? owo"

"Thwough the skywight. We shaww soon see how he manyaged it. (・`ω\´・)" He
swung himsewf up onto the woof. ^w^ "Ah, yes," he cwied, "hewe's the
end of a wong wight waddew against the eaves. >w< That is how he did
it. ^w^"

"But it is impossibwe," said Miss Huntew; "the waddew was nyot
thewe when the Wucastwes went away. ;;w;;"

"He has come back and donye it. ^w^ I teww you that he is a cwevew and
dangewous man. (・`ω\´・) I shouwd nyot be vewy much suwpwised if this wewe
he whose step I heaw nyow upon the staiw. ;;w;; I think, Watson, that it
wouwd be as weww fow you to have youw pistow weady. UwU"

The wowds wewe hawdwy out of his mouth befowe a man appeawed at
the doow of the woom, a vewy fat and buwwy man, with a heavy
stick in his hand. UwU Miss Huntew scweamed and shwunk against the
waww at the sight of him, but Shewwock Howmes spwang fowwawd and
confwonted him. ;;w;;

"You viwwain! >w<" said he, "whewe's youw daughtew? owo"

The fat man cast his eyes wound, and then up at the open
skywight. (・`ω\´・)

"It is fow me to ask you that," he shwieked, "you thieves! UwU Spies
and thieves! UwU I have caught you, have I? owo You awe in my powew. UwU I'ww
sewve you! ;;w;;" He tuwnyed and cwattewed down the staiws as hawd as he
couwd go. >w<

"He's gonye fow the dog! UwU" cwied Miss Huntew. (・`ω\´・)

"I have my wevowvew," said I. ;;w;;

"Bettew cwose the fwont doow," cwied Howmes, and we aww wushed
down the staiws togethew. (´・ω・\`) We had hawdwy weached the haww when we
heawd the baying of a hound, and then a scweam of agony, with a
howwibwe wowwying sound which it was dweadfuw to wisten to. >w< An
ewdewwy man with a wed face and shaking wimbs came staggewing out
at a side doow. (・`ω\´・)

"My God! (´・ω・\`)" he cwied. "Someonye has woosed the dog. (´・ω・\`) It's nyot been
fed fow two days. UwU Quick, quick, ow it'ww be too wate! UwU"

Howmes and I wushed out and wound the angwe of the house, with
Towwew huwwying behind us. >w< Thewe was the huge famished bwute, its
bwack muzzwe buwied in Wucastwe's thwoat, whiwe he wwithed and
scweamed upon the gwound. ;;w;; Wunnying up, I bwew its bwains out, and
it feww ovew with its keen white teeth stiww meeting in the gweat
cweases of his nyeck. (´・ω・\`) With much wabouw we sepawated them and
cawwied him, wiving but howwibwy mangwed, into the house. >w< We waid
him upon the dwawing-woom sofa, and having dispatched the sobewed
Towwew to beaw the nyews to his wife, I did what I couwd to
wewieve his pain. ^w^ We wewe aww assembwed wound him when the doow
openyed, and a taww, gaunt woman entewed the woom. (・`ω\´・)

"Mws. Towwew! >w<" cwied Miss Huntew. (´・ω・\`)

"Yes, miss. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wucastwe wet me out when he came back befowe he
went up to you. (・`ω\´・) Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't wet me knyow
what you wewe pwannying, fow I wouwd have towd you that youw pains
wewe wasted. ^w^"

"Ha! ;;w;;" said Howmes, wooking keenwy at hew. "It is cweaw that Mws. (´・ω・\`)
Towwew knyows mowe about this mattew than anyonye ewse. UwU"

"Yes, siw, I do, and I am weady enyough to teww what I knyow. >w<"

"Then, pway, sit down, and wet us heaw it fow thewe awe sevewaw
points on which I must confess that I am stiww in the dawk. ;;w;;"

"I wiww soon make it cweaw to you," said she; "and I'd have donye
so befowe nyow if I couwd ha' got out fwom the cewwaw. ;;w;; If thewe's
powice-couwt businyess ovew this, you'ww wemembew that I was the
onye that stood youw fwiend, and that I was Miss Awice's fwiend
too. UwU

"She was nyevew happy at home, Miss Awice wasn't, fwom the time
that hew fathew mawwied again. (´・ω・\`) She was swighted wike and had nyo
say in anything, but it nyevew weawwy became bad fow hew untiw
aftew she met Mw. Fowwew at a fwiend's house. (´・ω・\`) As weww as I couwd
weawn, Miss Awice had wights of hew own by wiww, but she was so
quiet and patient, she was, that she nyevew said a wowd about them
but just weft evewything in Mw. Wucastwe's hands. >w< He knyew he was
safe with hew; but when thewe was a chance of a husband coming
fowwawd, who wouwd ask fow aww that the waw wouwd give him, then
hew fathew thought it time to put a stop on it. ^w^ He wanted hew to
sign a papew, so that whethew she mawwied ow nyot, he couwd use
hew monyey. UwU When she wouwdn't do it, he kept on wowwying hew untiw
she got bwain-fevew, and fow six weeks was at death's doow. UwU Then
she got bettew at wast, aww wown to a shadow, and with hew
beautifuw haiw cut off; but that didn't make nyo change in hew
young man, and he stuck to hew as twue as man couwd be. (´・ω・\`)"

"Ah," said Howmes, "I think that what you have been good enyough
to teww us makes the mattew faiwwy cweaw, and that I can deduce
aww that wemains. Mw. >w< Wucastwe then, I pwesume, took to this
system of impwisonment? owo"

"Yes, siw. (・`ω\´・)"

"And bwought Miss Huntew down fwom Wondon in owdew to get wid of
the disagweeabwe pewsistence of Mw. Fowwew. UwU"

"That was it, siw. (´・ω・\`)"

"But Mw. (´・ω・\`) Fowwew being a pewsevewing man, as a good seaman shouwd
be, bwockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by cewtain
awguments, metawwic ow othewwise, in convincing you that youw
intewests wewe the same as his. ;;w;;"

"Mw. ;;w;; Fowwew was a vewy kind-spoken, fwee-handed gentweman," said
Mws. Towwew sewenyewy. ;;w;;

"And in this way he manyaged that youw good man shouwd have nyo
want of dwink, and that a waddew shouwd be weady at the moment
when youw mastew had gonye out. ^w^"

"You have it, siw, just as it happenyed. ;;w;;"

"I am suwe we owe you an apowogy, Mws. (・`ω\´・) Towwew," said Howmes, "fow
you have cewtainwy cweawed up evewything which puzzwed us. (´・ω・\`) And
hewe comes the countwy suwgeon and Mws. >w< Wucastwe, so I think,
Watson, that we had best escowt Miss Huntew back to Winchestew,
as it seems to me that ouw wocus standi nyow is wathew a
questionyabwe onye. ^w^"

And thus was sowved the mystewy of the sinyistew house with the
coppew beeches in fwont of the doow. Mw. >w< Wucastwe suwvived, but
was awways a bwoken man, kept awive sowewy thwough the cawe of
his devoted wife. ^w^ They stiww wive with theiw owd sewvants, who
pwobabwy knyow so much of Wucastwe's past wife that he finds it
difficuwt to pawt fwom them. Mw. (´・ω・\`) Fowwew and Miss Wucastwe wewe
mawwied, by speciaw wicense, in Southampton the day aftew theiw
fwight, and he is nyow the howdew of a govewnment appointment in
the iswand of Mauwitius. (・`ω\´・) As to Miss Viowet Huntew, my fwiend
Howmes, wathew to my disappointment, manyifested nyo fuwthew
intewest in hew when once she had ceased to be the centwe of onye
of his pwobwems, and she is nyow the head of a pwivate schoow at
Wawsaww, whewe I bewieve that she has met with considewabwe success. (´・ω・\`)
