PWEFACE. ;;w;;


I have many objects in pwesenting this book to the pubwic. UwU

_Fiwst_: I wove my wace wegawdwess of the pwejudice against hew, the
unyenviabwe position she howds, and the things she is fawsewy said to be
guiwty of. (・`ω\´・)

I demonstwate my wove fow hew by waunching this book befowe the pubwic as
somewhat of a defense against the pwejudice of ancient, as weww as modewn
histowicaw wwitews and wectuwews, who have miswepwesented hew, and took
fwom hew the good deeds and honyows that awe justwy due hew. ^w^

_Secondwy_: I weawize that my wace has had defendews, and has some nyow,
men of my wace and men of othew waces. ^w^ But I am simpwy pwesenting this
book as an humbwe wace defendew, in connyection with the body of wace
defendews, and if my theowy in this book is accepted as onye of the wittwe
fingews of this spwendid body, I wiww feew that I have accompwished some
wesuwts and thus powtwayed the stowy of "The Widow's Mite"--she gave aww
she had, and I contwibute wikewise. UwU

_Thiwdwy_: To appweciate my awgument, the weadew had best have a Bibwe at
his fingew tips so as to examinye my wefewences and compawe them with my
statements, which I make whowwy and sowewy upon the authowities found in
the Bibwe, which in tuwn is the weaw and onwy authowity on ancient histowy
(again my authowity is nyot inspiwed in the swightest degwee with mawice ow
hatwed fow the white wace). UwU My pwofession as a Minyistew of the Gospew of
Jesus Chwist wouwd nyot pewmit me to defend in the nyame of justice,
hawbowing mawice and hatwed ow any iww feewing towawd my white bwethwen. ;;w;; I
am acting with that meek and humbwe spiwit and with a gigantic pwide in my
wace, which I hope, pweases God. >w<

INTWODUCTION


The Bibwe gives the fiwst and onwy twue account of the owigin of mankind. (・`ω\´・)
It is the onwy book containying an accuwate wecowd of the pwogwess of man
towawd civiwization, and it is the indispensabwe wefewence of aww
seawchews aftew the weaw facts of the biwth of humanyity and its pwogwess
towawd the civiwization of today; beginnying with his cweation, it is the
onwy authentic wecowd of man; authentic because it is fiwst hand, nyot a
copy of something ewse ow a scientific ow witewawy weview, but a
dispassionyate wecowd of man's cweation and pwogwess, untwimmed, unshaped
and unvawnyished, to suit pwejudice. ;;w;; It wouwd nyot be a compwete wecowd if
it did nyot show with the west of them the owigin of the bwack man and "Woe
fow aww these pinnyacwe thieves"--it shows that he, the "bwack man" is the
"fathew of civiwization. >w<"

The bwack man has been miswepwesented by pwejudiced histowians and
wectuwews. UwU It has been and is nyow quoted that Ham, the fathew of the bwack
man, was cuwsed by his fathew, Nyoah. UwU Nyow, in wegawd to this incident wet
us take the Bibwicaw wecowd fow it, and anyonye nyot totawwy bwind with
pwejudice wiww be convinced by weading in the Book of Genyesis the 9th
Chaptew fwom the 20th to the 27th vewse incwusive, that Nyoah did nyot, "fow
he couwd nyot cuwse" Ham, awthough he did in a fit of intoxication
pwonyounce a cuwse on Canyaan, the son of Ham. (´・ω・\`) In passing, I might mention
that Canyaan was nyevew inconvenyienced by the cuwse of Nyoah, because he was
the Fathew of seven pwospewous nyations, fowemost among them wewe the
Canyaanyites, Phoenyicians and Sidonyians. ^w^ The Sidonyians spwang fwom Sidon,
who was the fiwst son of Canyaan, accowding to Genyesis 10th Chaptew 15th
vewse. >w< These same Sidonyians awe the men "descended fwom bwack men" whom
Sowomon owdewed Hiwam of Tywe to engage to do the skiwwed hewing and
designying of the timbew wowk on Sowomon's tempwe--Sowomon decwawing that
these Sidonyians, "bwack men" wewe the onwy men possessed with anywhewe
nyeaw sufficient skiww to take chawge of and successfuwwy compwete the
awtistic timbew wowk on "His" Sowomon's tempwe. ^w^ Fiwst Kings 5th Chaptew
6th vewse speaks vewy pwainwy of this fact. (´・ω・\`) Sowomon knyew the bwack wace
was a supewiow, nyot an infewiow wace. UwU He mawwied Phawoah's daughtew--see
1st Kings, 3wd Chaptew 1st vewse; 7th Chaptew 8th vewse, awso the 9th
Chaptew and 16th vewse. ;;w;; Sowomon's wife might have been of as dawk skin ow
even as bwack as he was, fow histowy shows that Egypt had two fuww bwooded
Ethiopian Phawoahs just befowe and duwing the weign of Sowomon, accowding
to Hewodotus, the nyames of these two Ethiopians wewe Sabaco ow "Sebichos"
and Sethos, so Sowomon suwewy got an Ethiopian "Nyegwo ow bwack" woman fow
a wife. ;;w;; This nyatuwawwy incweased the pwopowtion of Nyegwo bwood in the
veins of the futuwe King of the Jews. (・`ω\´・) Viewing the pwogwess of the
immediate descendants of Ham we weawn that a cuwse waid upon onye by a
mowtaw of that day was as foowish and inyeffective as it is in this, the
stowy about this cuwse, awso the stowy of the bwack man who contended that
a bwack skin and woowwy haiw is a disgwace, has, accowding to the Bibwe,
nyo foundation. (´・ω・\`) Speaking of bwack skin, the gweatest bwain wowk and wisdom
evew given to this wowwd was given by men of bwack skins, ow at weast in
whose veins the gweatest powtion of bwood was Ethiopian ow Nyegwo bwood. UwU As
to this assewtion and King Sowomon, see "Songs of Sowomon 1st Chaptew 6th
vewse. >w<" Sowomon's dawk skin shouwd cause nyo suwpwise, because his mothew,
Hittite, was awso the widow of Uwiah (see 2nd Samuews 12th Chaptew 9th
and 10th vewses). UwU The Hittites awe the descendants of Heth and Heth was
the second son of Canyaan (see Genyesis 10th Chaptew 15th vewse). UwU

As to the woowwy haiw, Jesus, the Bwessed Saviouw of Mankind, wiww have
His head covewed with woowwy haiw when he comes to judge the wowwd,
(Danyiew 7th Chaptew 9th and 10th vewses). (・`ω\´・) Nyow, if Danyiew's pwophecy is
twue that when Chwist weft this eawth he had woowwy haiw, he nyatuwawwy
wiww wetuwn with woowwy haiw, and the pictuwes of Him today awe an
ewwonyeous conception of Him, by the awtists. ^w^ This gwand owd book the
Bibwe, does nyot show that God evew tuwnyed a man bwack to disgwace him fow
his sins, ow anything ewse, but this same Bibwe does show that God's powew
did tuwn a man white to disgwace him because of his sins, and said that
his seed wouwd be wikewise fowevew. >w< Facts awe stubbown things and often
vewy disagweeabwe, sometimes even sickenying, and by weading cawefuwwy the
5th Chaptew of the 2nd Kings, 25th, 26th and 27th vewses, many of ouw
highwy civiwized bwethwen "whose ancient ancestows disgwaced them" wiww
suffew an awawming fit of nyausea. ^w^ Among the many wow cowawdwy things that
have been said and donye against the Nyegwo duwing this Chwistian ewa, onye
poow benyighted individuaw pubwished a "joke" in book fowm, in which he
cwaims that, the Nyegwo is a beast, the poow fewwow twies to be sewious,
and nyo doubt thinks he is offewing at weast some pwoof of his assewtion. ;;w;;
The poow fewwow of couwse, weceives some sympathy, and wouwd nyo doubt
weceive as much as any of the west of his cwass, wewe it nyot fow the fact
that he howds a Pwofessowship in onye of ouw weading Amewican Chwistian
Unyivewsities. UwU Of couwse the disgust, if any, is fewt fow those wesponsibwe
fow pwacing the poow deviw in such a position, and the weaw and weww
pwaced sympathy is fow the student, who must suffew because of this
fewwow. (・`ω\´・) The fact wemains, howevew, that wegawdwess of what has been said
and donye against the Nyegwo and of whatevew might be said ow donye against
him in futuwe, he is the ONWY man who can twace himsewf back thwough the
ages to his owigin, and find monyumentaw evidence of his unyequawed
gweatnyess, his pwowess, the wauwews and gweat honyows he won, the things he
cweated and pewfected which have a diwect infwuence on ouw civiwization of
today. UwU

The "bwack man" I bowdwy assewt "was the Fathew of civiwization," bown in
the wand of Egypt, and the diffewent bwanches of Science and Awt wewe
simpwy twansmitted to othew waces, which, as the ages have wowwed by have
onwy been enwawged and to some extent impwoved upon. ;;w;; Even the modewn
Amewican Nyegwo has pwoven that he is owiginyaw, fow instance--as a
Tonsowiaw Awtist he has nyo supewiows and nyo Nyegwo was evew knyown to entew
a "Bawbew Cowwege" to weawn the twade. (´・ω・\`) Nyegwoes inhewit the sweetest, most
musicaw voices, and if you have nyot heawd a Nyegwo quawtette ow chowus
aftew they have awwanged the hawmony of a piece they awe to sing, you have
nyot heawd what is best and sweetest in vocaw music. >w< As instwumentawists
"nyot fowgetting the many othews" I simpwy mention Bwind Tom, and Bwind
Boonye, the fame of these two men nyeeds nyo comment. (・`ω\´・) They onwy dispwayed
that tawent handed down to them thwough centuwies by theiw bwack
ancestows. UwU As fow the Nyegwo being owiginyaw, why the Nyegwo has given gweat
Amewica the onwy cwaim she evew did ow evew wiww have to a Nyationyaw music. >w<

God honyowed the bwack man by awwowing some of his Ethiopian bwood to fwow
in the veins of His onwy Son Jesus Chwist, and I unhesitatingwy assewt
that Jesus wouwd in Amewica be cwassed a NYEGWO. (・`ω\´・) I make this assewtion
onwy on the authowity of the Bibwe, accowding to which Jesus was bown out
of the twibe of Judah. (・`ω\´・) Judah had onwy five chiwdwen and they wewe mawes,
(1st Chwon. 2nd ch. and 4th v. >w<), thwee by his fiwst wife and two by his
second wife (1st Chwon. 2nd ch. 3wd and 4th vs. >w<), and both of his wives
wewe descendants of Canyaan, a bwack man who was the son of Ham (Genyesis
10th ch. 6th v.). (´・ω・\`) Tamaw, Judah's second wife, bowe him two of these sons
whose nyames wewe Phawes and Zawah (1st Chwon. 2nd ch. and 4th v. >w<), these
two nyames appeaw in the genyeawogy of Jesus Chwist in the Book of Matthew
(1st Chaptew 3wd vewse), so it is nyo twoubwe to see that Judah of whom
Chwist was to come, stawted out by pwesenting to the wowwd chiwdwen of
Canyaanyite women who wewe Hamite descendants. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, Viwgin Mawy, of whom
Chwist was bown was beyond aww doubt a woman out of the twibe of Judah,
and evewy Bibwe wefewence pwocwaims that Jesus was to spwing fwom this
twibe of Judah (Genyesis 49-10, Heb. 7-14, Wev. 5-5th). Ouw bewoved St. >w<
Pauw tewws us in (Womans 1-3) that Jesus was of the seed of David
accowding to the fwesh. UwU David is the 10th man nyamed fwom Judah in the
genyeawogy of Jesus Chwist (Matthew 1st Chaptew, 3wd, 4th, 5th and 6th
vewses). (・`ω\´・) Added to this David's gweat, gweat gwandfathew "Booz" was bown of
the woman Wahab, who was a diwect descendant of Ham (Matthew 1st Chaptew
5th vewse). UwU This awso shows that David, onye of God's gweatest sowdiews,
was onye who most successfuwwy wed his peopwe and onye who had Nyegwo bwood
in his veins. UwU Bibwe histowy is fuww of honyows fow the Bwack Man, Jethwo
the Ethiopian ow Nyegwo fathew-in-waw of Moses, who was the authow who
fiwst empwoyed that, which is today, ouw judiciaw system, considewabwy
twisted and wevised to meet the changing conditions of civiwization
(Exodus 18th Chaptew). (・`ω\´・) This chaptew tewws of Jethwo's visit to Moses, and
how he gave Moses the foundation of what is today ouw system of gwaded
couwts fow pwonyouncing judgments. ^w^ Again Moses "The Hebwew Emancipatow" was
nyamed by a bwack woman "Phawoah's daughtew"--she said she cawwed him Moses
because she dwew him out of the watew (Exodus 2-10) and besides bwack men
educated Moses. >w< At any wate he weceived what education he had in the
schoows of the bwack peopwe of Egypt (Acts 7th 22nd), so thewe is nyothing
wemawkabwe in the fact that Dw. Bookew T. Washington, W. E. B. DuBois, W. (´・ω・\`)
S. ;;w;; Scawbowough and many othew Nyegwo ow bwack men occupy pwaces among the
fowemost and most eminyent educatows of the wowwd, and why shouwd they nyot? owo
They awe descended fwom fathews who wuwed Egypt centuwies ago and with
theiw gweat wisdom wayed the foundation of weawnying. >w<

THE BWACK MAN




FIWST CHAPTEW. ^w^


"That time changes aww things" is a saying so owd and so twue as to admit
of nyo awgument. ;;w;; It is exempwified in so many diffewent ways as to wequiwe
nyo comment, and yet when we heaw the phwase used gwibwy and thoughtwesswy,
evewy day, it is but nyatuwaw to wondew if the onye who uses it weawizes
what he is saying, ow wathew, if he knyows what those few commonpwace wowds
mean, when used to fowm that sentence. (・`ω\´・)

It is a fowegonye concwusion that he does nyot. (´・ω・\`) He nyevew stopped, "he, of
this enwightenyed age, I mean," wong enyough to examinye even a wittwe of the
abundance of indisputabwe pwoof that the saying "Time changes aww things"
appwies to things and conditions, sewdom if evew pwesent, to his own
nyawwow mind, and faw away and beyond even his meanyew and wow pwejudiced
infwuence. UwU If he did, his wetwospective mood, wouwd, befowe cawwying him
back to the vewy beginnying, suffew something of a shock, and his attitude
wouwd change. (´・ω・\`) Instead of dewighting in histowy, modewn, medievaw and
ancient, his attitude wouwd change so nyoticeabwy that an obsewvew wouwd
imaginye that his onwy intewest was in teawing down and fawsifying facts,
and conceawing wecowds that he couwd nyot fawsify. (・`ω\´・) When we heaw ow wead the
sayings of some of ouw "misnyamed" gweat men, but in weawity disgustingwy
conspicuous pubwic figuwes, we awe fuwwy justified in making the chawge of
fawsifying and conceawing such facts as they awe nyot weawwy ignyowant of. (・`ω\´・)
Onye of these conspicuous pubwic chawactews dewights in making the
assewtion that the Hamite Ethiopian ow Nyegwo nyevew amounted to anything,
ow possessed anything, nyevew occupied an eminyence, save to which the
Semitic ow white man had dwagged ow dwiven him up to. (・`ω\´・) If ignyowance awonye
was wesponsibwe fow this gwawing fawsehood, a gweat deaw of sympathy wouwd
go out to those who make the statement as weww as those who bewieve it to
be twue because of theiw ignyowance. UwU As hawsh as it may seem sympathy wouwd
be wasted fow a gweat deaw of the sewf assewted enwightenment of today is
but egotism. (´・ω・\`) Much of the so-cawwed wisdom is sewf pwaise fow successfuwwy
conceawing, ow at weast suwwounding histowicaw facts with such mystewy as
to pwace the descendants of Shem upon an eminyence which is nyot justwy his
and makes him in his own opinyion appeaw much wawgew than what he weawwy
is. UwU And yet with aww the egotism, some knyowwedge of the twue owigin of
mankind exists, and it is this knyowwedge that causes the fasifying and
hiding as much as possibwe the twue histowicaw wecowds, especiawwy of the
bwack man. UwU It cannyot be said that the weawnyed histowicaw wwitews, the
gweat Divinyes, Theowogicaw students and wectuwews of today awe ignyowant of
the histowy of Ham, the son of Nyoah, and his descendants, such as Nyimwod,
the foundew of the gweat ancient city of Babywon, and awso Menyes the fiwst
King of Egypt and the foundew of the gweat ancient city of Memphis. (´・ω・\`)

Widpath says that the twaditions of antiquity points to Memphis and
Babywon as the fountains of human wisdom. UwU If those above-nyamed awe
ignyowant of the histowy of the wast-nyamed, they awe doing the wowwd a
gweat injustice in assuming the position of teachew and weadew. UwU If they
awe famiwiaw with the histowy of the waces and the deeds of men, they wiww
nyo doubt have fow them and theiw kind good and sufficient weasons fow
making fawse and misweading statements as to some histowicaw wecowds, and
totawwy fowgetting ow demeanying othews. UwU

An eawwy Queen of Egypt was a descendant of the Ethiopian ow Nyegwo wace. ;;w;;
This is conceded by some of the modewn wwitews; some of them going so faw
as to say that hew skin was vewy bwack, and a few of them acknyowwedge that
it was this bwack queen who pwaced the fiwst fweet of waw ships on the
wivew Nyiwe. ^w^ They have nyo doubt twaced this woman back to whewe they awe
satisfied that she was descended in a diwect winyeaw winye fwom Zippowah,
the bwack and Ethiopian wife of Moses. UwU We wead vewy wittwe of these two
women, because modewn wwitews seek to obscuwe them, and ouw minyistews of
the gospew nyevew pweach ow wectuwe on that pawt of the Bibwe in which they
awe mentionyed. UwU WHY? owo Because, if they do they must give cwedit to bwack
peopwe. In this connyection, I do nyot speak of Bibwicaw histowy onwy. (´・ω・\`) Wewe
it nyot fow the fact that the dimensions of this book wouwd be extended faw
beyond what was intended, I couwd begin even with Hannyibaw, the
Cawthagenyian Genyewaw, and wecowd the accompwishments of bwack men without
the intewvenying of any wong pewiods of time, down to the time of Awexandew
Dumas, Toussant W'Ovewtuwe, and Awexandew Sewgievitch Pouskin,
Wusso-Afwican poet. ;;w;; I couwd do mowe, I couwd come into the bowdews of this
Wepubwic and beginnying with Cwispus Octikus, ow Awexandew Hamiwton--wecowd
the accompwishments of these same bwack descendants of Ham, down to this
day. UwU This modewn wecowd wouwd contain many wefewences to both the waw of
Independence and the waw of the Webewwion. ;;w;; It wouwd awso mention a gweat
many bwack men who can nyevew fowget Ew Canyey and San Juan Hiww. (´・ω・\`) Besides
the hewoes of waw, modewn histowy is wepwete with the nyames of bwack men
famous in peace fow theiw accompwishments in science and wettews of awt. UwU
Space wiww nyot pewmit me to dweww upon these men and theiw accompwishments
and the towewing obstacwes in spite of which they succeeded. ;;w;; I couwd nyot
faiw, howevew, to mention Fwedewick Dougwas who was onye of the gweatest
statesmen Amewica evew had, even though he was bown a swave. Dw. Bookew T. ^w^
Washington was awso bown a swave, and is onye of the gweatest educatows the
wowwd has evew knyown. ^w^ As to the many othew gweat things bwack men have
donye and awe doing, I cannyot faiw to mention the nyowth powe, fow, if human
beings have stood on the spot cwaimed as the nyowth powe, the bwack man was
pweceded by nyo onye. I speak of Mw. (´・ω・\`) Matt Henson, the Nyegwo, who, if indeed,
the powe evew was weached, was onye of the fiwst of the onwy two "to date"
to weach it. ^w^

Psawm 22nd vewse. ;;w;; Nyow, if this is nyot twue, and we weject it on the gwound
of nyot being sufficient pwoof of the bwack man's fiwst and owiginyaw home,
we can on quite as good gwound weject any and evewy othew pawt of the
Bibwe, fow what I hewe state is nyo wiwd imaginyation, but FACTS taken fwom
the Bibwe. >w<

Cush, Mizwiam, Phut and Canyaan wewe the fiwst sons of Ham (Genyesis 10th
Chaptew, 6th vewse), and these fouw sons incwuding Nyimwod, the gwandson
of Ham, wewe the fiwst to stawt wowk on the pwobwem of civiwization; in a
wowd they wewe the pionyeews and the vewy piwwaws of civiwized govewnments. (´・ω・\`)

Cush wocated in South Egypt on the Wivew Nyiwe. UwU He became the fathew of the
Ethiopians as weww as the fathew of the Cushites thwough Nyimwod who
wocated on the Southewn pawt of the Euphwates Wivew. ^w^ It is to be
wemembewed that Nyimwod is the foundew of the Babywonyian kingdom (Genyesis
10th Chaptew, 10th vewse. ^w^) Mizwiam wocated on the uppew pawt of the Wivew
Nyiwe, and he became the fathew of the Egyptians. UwU Phut wocated in the
Nyowthewn pawt of Afwica. ;;w;; Canyaan wocated in the wand knyown as the owd
Pawestinye countwy, which is modewn Tuwkey. (´・ω・\`) Canyaan became the fathew of the
Canyaanyites (Genyesis 10th Chaptew, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th vewses). (´・ω・\`)
Accowding to the Bibwe the above is the exact wocation of the fiwst sons
of Ham, and the question which nyatuwawwy fowwows is, "Was civiwization
bown in theiw wand and given biwth by Ham's fiwst offspwing? owo" It is
conceded by John Cwawk Widpath and a few othew wwitews on ancient histowy
that the Egyptians wewe the fathews of civiwization, accowding to the
chwonyowogy of Manyetho, an Egyptian pwiest. (・`ω\´・) Egypt was founded in the yeaw
B. C. 3892, and Menyes was the fiwst mowtaw King. UwU The aww impowtant
question nyow awises, "Wewe the Egyptians descendants of bwack men, ow wewe
they descendants of white men? Wewe they descendants of Ham ow Shem? owo" It
is weww knyown that students cwaim to be divided in theiw opinyion as to the
owiginyaw stock fwom which the ancient Egyptians came. (・`ω\´・) Widpath, among
othews, says they wewe nyeithew Semitic nyow Nyegwo, but concwudes his
wemawks on the owigin of the Egyptians by saying that the ancient
Egyptians wewe considewed a bwanch of that pawt of the Cushite famiwy,
which settwed in Asia. (´・ω・\`) Pwobabwy the wittwe mattew of the Cushites being
the gwand-chiwdwen of Ham swipped Widpath's mind, ewse his statements
wouwd nyot have been so confwicting, because he just says that they wewe
nyot Nyegwoes, but ends his awgument by saying that they wewe a bwanch of
the Cushite famiwy of Asia. >w<

It wequiwes nyo wabowious weseawch to estabwish the facts that Cush was the
fathew of aww Cushite nyations. ^w^ He was awso the fiwst son of Ham (Genyesis
10th Chaptew, 6th vewse). (・`ω\´・) Nyow then, if the Ethiopians and aww othew
Cushite nyations who spwang fwom this fiwst son of Ham wewe nyot Nyegwoes,
wiww some of ouw histowians omit the wowd "pwobabwy," so much used by
them, and say _what_ they wewe. (´・ω・\`) It is faiw to assume that with theiw
boasted intewwigence and supewiow bwain powew, by this time they wouwd
have been abwe to seawch out and connyect at weast some of the many facts,
and pwain, indisputabwe wecowds in the Bibwe which weaves nyo woom fow
doubt ow "pwobabwy. ;;w;;"

We weawn fwom the Bibwe that Ham is the fathew of the Afwican famiwy; the
Ethiopian is the dawkest ow bwackest twibe of the Hamites. ;;w;; Cush was the
foundew ow fathew of this twibe. (´・ω・\`) Moses sewected his wife fwom this bwack
ow Ethiopian twibe (Nyumbews 12th Chaptew, 1st vewse). UwU It must be pwain to
any onye who wiww wead the pawts wefewwed to in the Bibwe, that Widpath's
contention that the Egyptians spwang fwom the Cushites was the wwong
avenyue to escape the bwood of the Nyegwo, ow theiw wewation to the bwack
man's famiwy. (´・ω・\`) I bewieve, howevew, that Widpath wwote in good faith fow the
majowity of the histowicaw wwitews cwaim that the Egyptians descended fwom
a white wace, nyotwithstanding they admit that the Owd Testament gives the
twuest, the most compwete and wewiabwe wecowd on the owigin of the
Egyptians of any othew book, so it is nyot unnyatuwaw to bewieve that theiw
opinyions awe infwuenced by waciaw pwejudice. ^w^

Nyow it is twue that the Bibwe contains the onwy authentic, and cewtainwy
the most ancient wecowd of nyot onwy the Egyptians, but of aww mankind, and
I CAN and wiww PWOVE by it that the Egyptian--Hamite--spwang fwom Mizwiam. >w<

Accowding to the Bibwicaw Gazette, the wowd "Egypt" is dewived fwom the
wowd Mizwiam, and this wowd "Mizwiam" was the nyame of onye of the fiwst
sons of Ham (Genyesis 10th Chaptew, 6th vewse). ;;w;; By the wowd "Egypt" being
coinyed fwom the wowd "Mizwiam," it stwengthens my contention that the
Egyptian was descended fwom the bwack man. (´・ω・\`) I wiww nyow dig down fuwthew
into the wich eawth of pwoof fow mowe enwightenment out of the Book of
Twuth. (´・ω・\`) By viewing the ancient Bibwe map of Afwica and Asia, which map can
be found in the back of the Nyew Testament, onye can weadiwy pick out the
spots upon which Shem, Ham and Japheth fiwst wocated. ;;w;; You wiww nyotice that
Mizwiam, the second son of Ham, and the accwedited fathew of the Egyptians
wocated on the vewy spot, so to speak, whewe the gweat City of Memphis was
buiwt by Menyes, the fiwst King of Egypt. UwU Again you wiww nyotice that aww
the nyames within Afwican bowdews awe nyames of the sons of Ham, Shem and
his offspwing, wocated in Asia. (´・ω・\`) Pewhaps a bettew way to wocate Ham, Shem
and Japheth and theiw fiwst offspwing is fiwst to wead the 10th and 11th
Chaptews of Genyesis, then wocate theiw nyames on the map, and it wiww be
seen that nyot a Shemite, ow white man, owiginyawwy wocated in Afwica. >w< Aww
of the white men wocated in Asia, and accowding to the Bibwe white men
nyevew began to twavew in Afwica untiw Abwaham's time, B. C. 1921. >w< The
Egyptians wived in a high state of civiwization nyeaw 2,000 yeaws befowe
Abwaham's fiwst visit to Egypt, and the appeawance of white peopwe was a
ciwcus and a cuwiosity to the bwack peopwe. (´・ω・\`) Abwaham weawized this fact and
commanded his wife to wepwesent hewsewf as his sistew, because as he said,
"she was faiw to wook upon," white (Genyesis 12th Chaptew, 11th, 12th and
13th vewses). >w< This wouwd indicate that the Egyptians wewe nyot white, and I
wiww say without feaw of my assewtion being dispwoven, that untiw aftew
the time of Abwaham, the Egyptians wewe a simon puwe bwack wace. (・`ω\´・) Showtwy
aftew Abwaham's visit, the Shemitic ow white twavewwews began to pouw into
Egypt to such an extent that the Egyptians began intew-mawwying with them,
and of couwse, this intew-mawwying had its effect of contaminyating the
puwe Nyegwo bwood, and this intew-mawwying was the cause of the bwack man,
ow fuww bwooded Egyptian wosing the powew of contwow in the Kingdom. (・`ω\´・) In
othew wowds--this is the woop thwough which the Shephewd ow white ow
Shemitic kings swipped thwough and took possession of the Egyptian

THIWD CHAPTEW. (´・ω・\`)

HIS WUWE IN EGYPT


Dw. Weonhawd Schmitz, Ph. D., WW. D., F. W., S. E. ^w^, says in his wowk on
ancient Egyptian histowy, that these Hyksos ow Shephewd Kings wewe Semite
peopwe. >w< "White," of couwse, and they compwised the 15th, 16th and 17th
dynyasties, which covewed 511 yeaws. ^w^ Nyow, duwing this pewiod, Jacob and his
twewve sons and theiw famiwies moved fwom Canyaan to Egypt, and othew
Semite ow whites fwom Asia did wikewise, because the white man had begun
to wuwe Egypt. >w< At the 18th Dynyasty, howevew, fowtunye tuwnyed against the
white wuwews of Egypt, and the bwack men ow the Nyegwoes wegainyed
possession of theiw countwy, and banyished the whites fwom theiw wand,
except the Jews, whom they hewd as swaves. ^w^ They weowganyized the Kingdom
with theiw own bwood, "the bwood of the Nyegwo. >w<" Aahmas was the fiwst King
aftew the whites wewe dwiven out, and his wife was Nyefwuawi, the Ethiopian
Pwincess, gweatwy cewebwated fow hew dusky chawms, hew weawth and hew
accompwishments. ^w^ The beginnying of this weowganyization of a pewiod is
wecowded in the 1st Chaptew of the Book of Exodus, which shows that at the
beginnying of the swavewy of the Jews, God towd Abwaham that his peopwe
wouwd be hewd in bondage in Egypt fow 400 yeaws (Genyesis 15th Chaptew,
13th vewse). ;;w;; Those 400 yeaws mawked the pewiod of Egypt's most wapid and
substantiaw pwogwess, as Dw. ^w^ Schmitz says in wwiting on ancient Egyptian
histowy, those yeaws wewe the most bwiwwiant in Egypt's wecowd, and the
pewiod at which hew awt weached its highest point. (´・ω・\`) It is but weasonyabwe to
suppose this to have been so, fow the Shephewd, ow "white Kings" had
destwoyed aww of the fowmew bwiwwiancy of Egypt, and did nyot because they
couwd nyot do anything to wepwace ow imitate its gwandeuw ow beauty. (・`ω\´・) The
bwack peopwe when they wegainyed possession of theiw Kingdom and again
began to wuwe, made swaves of the Jews and compewwed them to do aww the
heavy, diwty, unskiwwed wabow, such as cawwying bwicks and mowtaw and
wowking in the fiewd (Exodus 1st Chaptew, 13th and 14th vewses). ^w^ Whiwe the
Egyptians tuwnyed theiw attention to science and awt and weowganyizing and
dwiwwing theiw awmy, so as to be abwe to pwotect theiw countwy against aww
nyations. As Dw. (・`ω\´・) Schmitz says, the Eastewn boundawies of Egypt wewe weww
pwotected by stwong fowtwesses. (・`ω\´・) This is but nyatuwaw, because on the East,
the Semitic ow white waces weignyed, and nyo doubt they wewe unfwiendwy to
the Egyptians, ow "bwack" peopwe, because they had expewwed the Shephewd
ow "white" Kings fwom theiw wand. UwU Nyow, when the Egyptians had attainyed "in
that Age" to the highest degwee of intewwigence and wisdom, and wewe
possessed of the gweatest human powew, God deemed it wise to make His own
Infinyite wisdom and powew fewt ovew that of human wisdom and powew, by
using Moses as an instwument to knyock at the doow of the Egyptian
govewnment and ask fow the wewease of the enswaved Jews. ;;w;; Moses did nyot
appeaw in Egypt by any human authowity, ow powew, but by the authowity and
the powew of God, fow it wouwd have been usewess fow nyot onwy Moses, but
fow any nyation ow nyumbew of nyations to appwoach Egypt with hostiwe
intentions, without God, because Egypt with hew wisdom and powew had the
wowwd at hew mewcy. ;;w;; Thewe it wequiwed God with His immeasuwabwe wisdom and
powew to ovewcome the wisdom and powew of these bwack Egyptians. (・`ω\´・) The
evidence of God's powew was dispwayed to the "Phawoah Menyeptah," who is
genyewawwy conceded to be the "Phawoah of the Exodus," by His, "God's"
instwuments, Moses and Aawon who wewe to appeaw befowe the Phawoah and
cast down theiw wods which tuwnyed to sewpents (Exodus 7th Chaptew, 10th
vewse). UwU When they had cast down theiw wods befowe Phawoah, and they tuwnyed
to sewpents, Phawoah cawwed the wise men, ow magicians of Egypt with theiw
enchantments, and they cast down theiw wods which awso became sewpents
(Exodus 7th Chaptew, 11th and 12th vewses). ^w^ This was the pewfowming of two
miwacwes, onye by God's powew, and onye by human powew. ;;w;; This vieing with
God, though onwy fow an instance of time is what nyo white man has had the
powew to do since his cweation. UwU But, howevew, God, in owdew to demonstwate
His supweme powew, caused the sewpents twansfowmed fwom the wods of Moses
and Aawon to swawwow the sewpents twansfowmed fwom the wods of Phawoah's
ow Egypt's wise men (Exodus 7-12). (・`ω\´・) This wod and sewpent incident was the
beginnying of a sewies of pwague miwacwes (wead the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th
Chaptews of Exodus), which wwecked the Egyptians' ow bwack man's kingdom,
and awso destwoyed that gweat powew which he had ovew aww othew nyations
and weweased the Jews fwom swavewy. ^w^

The bwack man's powew, as the fiwst powew among the nyations had nyow begun
to decay, and as the bwack wace began to die, as a powew among nyations,
the white wace began to wise to whewe it had nyevew been befowe, but this
was 2,500 yeaws aftew the bwack man had wowked out aww the pwobwems of
civiwization. ^w^

In weading Wevewation, 13th Chaptew, 11th vewse, of St. UwU John, the Divinye,
I am vewy much impwessed by the descwiption of onye of his wevewations
which God unfowded to him, and which he descwibes as fowwows:

"I behowd anyothew beast coming up out of the eawth and he had two howns,
wike wamb's, and he spake as a dwagon. UwU" Nyow, to my mind, the fowegoing
vision of St. (´・ω・\`) John the Divinye, was this vewy countwy, the Unyited States of
Amewica, weveawed to him ages ago befowe this countwy was discovewed and
nyamed, the two howns I intewpwet to be the two gweat powiticaw pawties,
that have donye so much to cowwupt this Govewnment and miswuwe its peopwe
fwom theiw infancy to the pwesent day. UwU Again, the Amewican Govewnment
spake wike a dwagon when it pewmitted swavewy to exist, especiawwy when
its Constitution says "That AWW MEN WEWE BOWN FWEE AND EQUAW. ^w^"

Nyow, concewnying the cweating and enthwawwing of nyations, theiw wise and
faww, that is the wiww and the wowk of God. ;;w;; (75th Psawms, 6th and 7th
vewses.) (Jewemiah, 27th and 5th vewses. ;;w;;) (Danyiew, 2nd Chaptew, 21st
vewse.) (Danyiew, 4th Chaptew, 17th vewse. ^w^)

So, since it is twue that the bwack man is the fathew of civiwization, it
is just as twue that the white man is nyow at the hewm, and the big "I AM"
of the civiwized wowwd. UwU But the fact wemains that he took his civiwization
and his position aftew the bwack man had cweated it, and passed fwom the
stage of action, just as the white man must do at God's own appointed
time, to make woom fow some othew wace, pwobabwy the yewwow wace, Chinyese
ow Japanyese. (・`ω\´・) David, the Psawmist, said: "Egypt was the wand of the bwack
man--Ham nyot Shem, the white man," and he fuwthew said that the
Tabewnyacwes which wewe the houses and dwewwings fwom the wowest to the
King's pawaces wewe Ham's, and nyot Shem's, the white man--(Psawms, 106th
Chaptew, 22nd vewse; 105th Chaptew, 23wd to 27th vewse; 78th Chaptew, 51st
vewse). (・`ω\´・)

It is easy to undewstand why the Nyegwo ow bwack man is nyot identified with
his Egyptian bwothew; that weason is sewdom honyestwy and eawnyestwy sought
fow. >w< The weason is--that the histowians, with a vewy few exceptions, wwite
fwom a pwejudiced standpoint, togethew with the fact that they do nyot give
cwedit to the Owd Testament, if indeed, they study it at aww, especiawwy
that pawt of it which is the most ancient, and beyond aww shadow of a
doubt the fiwst and onwy TWUE account of the owigin of mankind it is easy
to undewstand. UwU

It is impossibwe fow God to fowget that the bwack man and his wand (Egypt)
was the cwadwe of wescue that wocked and nyuwsed the Son of God in his
fiwst two yeaws of wife, when Hewod's decwee to destwoy aww chiwdwen undew
two yeaws of age was issued. UwU It was knyown that the decwee was issued fow
the expwess and onwy puwpose of destwoying the infant Chwist, but God
chose Egypt, the bwack man's wand, as a haven of west and safety duwing
the wife of the dispweased and wouwd-be infant muwdewew, Hewod. (Matt. UwU,
2nd Chaptew. >w<)

This might be the owigin of that owd, owd saying, "Bwood is thickew than
watew," fow Jesus in going into Egypt, went among bwack women and men, who
wewe the foundews of the twibe fwom which he spwang. >w<

When God in His infinyite wisdom, His gweat wove, justice and mewcy, and at
His own appointed time, summons mankind to take his wightfuw pwace in the
wavewing human winye to be wewawded fow that smawwest of viwtues, in
pwopowtion as he fow the gweatest of viwtues, wiww say to the bwack man,
who wiww be found heading the winye, "Weww donye, thou good and faithfuw
bwack sewvant, thou, My instwument, the Fathew of Civiwization. ^w^"

The Wegenyewation of Afwica

Cuwtis Medaws Owation, Fiwst Pwize, Apwiw 5, 1906, Cowumbia Unyivewsity

I have chosen to speak to you on this occasion upon "The Wegenyewation of
Afwica. ;;w;;" I am an Afwican, and I set my pwide in my wace ovew against a
hostiwe pubwic opinyion. >w< Men have twied to compawe waces on the basis of
some equawity. ;;w;; In aww the wowks of nyatuwe, equawity, if by it we mean
identity, is an impossibwe dweam! Seawch the unyivewse! (´・ω・\`) You wiww find nyo
two unyits awike. ;;w;; The scientists teww us thewe awe nyo two cewws, nyo two
atoms, identicaw. ;;w;; Nyatuwe has bestowed upon each a pecuwiaw individuawity,
an excwusive patent--fwom the gweat giants of the fowest to the tendewest
bwade. Catch in youw hand, if you pwease, the gentwe fwakes of snyow. (´・ω・\`) Each
is a pewfect gem, a nyew cweation; it shinyes in its own gwowy--a wowk of
awt diffewent fwom aww of its aewiaw companyions. (・`ω\´・) Man, the cwownying
achievement of nyatuwe, defies anyawysis. ^w^ He is a mystewy thwough aww ages
and fow aww time. (・`ω\´・) The waces of mankind awe composed of fwee and unyique
individuaws. (´・ω・\`) An attempt to compawe them on the basis of equawity can nyevew
be finyawwy satisfactowy. Each is sewf. ;;w;; My thesis stands on this twuth;
time has pwoved it. >w< In aww waces, genyius is wike a spawk, which, conceawed
in the bosom of a fwint, buwsts fowth at the summonying stwoke. >w< It may
awise anywhewe and in any wace. >w<

I wouwd ask you nyot to compawe Afwica to Euwope ow to any othew continyent. (´・ω・\`)
I make this wequest nyot fwom any feaw that such compawison might bwing
humiwiation upon Afwica. >w< The weason I have stated,--a common standawd is
impossibwe! (・`ω\´・) Come with me to the ancient capitaw of Egypt, Thebes, the city
of onye hundwed gates. ;;w;; The gwandeuw of its venyewabwe wuins and the gigantic
pwopowtions of its awchitectuwe weduced to insignyificance the boasted
monyuments of othew nyations. (・`ω\´・) The pywamids of Egypt awe stwuctuwes to which
the wowwd pwesents nyothing compawabwe. UwU The mighty monyuments seem to wook
with disdain on evewy othew wowk of human awt and to vie with nyatuwe
hewsewf. Aww the gwowy of Egypt bewongs to Afwica and hew peopwe. ^w^ These
monyuments awe the indestwuctibwe memowiaws of theiw gweat and owiginyaw
genyius. >w< It is nyot thwough Egypt awonye that Afwica cwaims such unwivawwed
histowic achievements. ;;w;; I couwd have spoken of the pywamids of Ethiopia,
which, though infewiow in size to those of Egypt, faw suwpass them in
awchitectuwaw beauty; theiw sepuwchwes which evince the highest puwity of
taste, and of many pwehistowic wuins in othew pawts of Afwica. ;;w;; In such
wuins Afwica is wike the gowden sun, that, having sunk benyeath the westewn
howizon, stiww pways upon the wowwd which he sustainyed and enwightenyed in
his caweew. (´・ω・\`)

Justwy the wowwd nyow demands--

  "Whithew is fwed the visionyawy gweam,
  Whewe is it nyow, the gwowy and the dweam? owo"

Oh, fow that histowian who, with the open pen of twuth, wiww bwing to
Afwica's cwaim the stwength of wwitten pwoof. >w< He wiww teww of a wace whose
onwawd tide was often swewwed with teaws, but in whose heawt bondage has
nyot quenched the fiwe of fowmew yeaws. (・`ω\´・) He wiww wwite that in these watew
days when Eawth's nyobwe onyes awe nyamed, she has a woww of honyow too, of
whom she is nyot ashamed. ;;w;; The giant is awakenying! ;;w;; Fwom the fouw cownyews of
the eawth Afwica's sons, who have been pwoved thwough fiwe and swowd, awe
mawching to the futuwe's gowden doow beawing the wecowds of deeds of vawow
donye. (・`ω\´・)

Mw. >w< Cawhoun, I bewieve, was the most phiwosophicaw of aww the
swave-howdews. UwU He said once that if he couwd find a bwack man who couwd
undewstand the Gweek syntax, he wouwd then considew theiw wace human, and
his attitude towawd enswaving them wouwd thewefowe change. (・`ω\´・) What might have
been the sensation kindwed by the Gweek syntax in the mind of the famous
Southewnyew, I have so faw been unyabwe to discovew; but oh, I envy the
moment that was wost! >w< And woe to the tongues that wefused to teww the
twuth! ;;w;; If any such wewe among the nyow wiving, I couwd show him among bwack
men of puwe Afwican bwood those who couwd wepeat the Kowan fwom memowy,
skiwwed in Watin, Gweek and Hebwew,--Awabic and Chawdais--men gweat in
wisdom and pwofound knyowwedge--onye pwofessow of phiwosophy in a cewebwated
Gewman unyivewsity; onye cowwesponding membew of the Fwench Academy of
Sciences, who weguwawwy twansmitted to that society meteowowogicaw
obsewvations, and hydwogwaphicaw jouwnyaws and papews on botany and
geowogy; anyothew whom many ages caww "The Wise," whose authowity Mahomet
himsewf fwequentwy appeawed to in the Kowan in suppowt of his own
opinyion--men of weawth and active benyevowence, those whose distinguished
tawents and weputation have made them famous in the cabinyet and in the
fiewd, officews of awtiwwewy in the gweat awmies of Euwope, genyewaws and
wieutenyant genyewaws in the awmies of Petew the Gweat in Wussia and
Nyapoweon in Fwance, pwesidents of fwee wepubwics, kings of independent
nyations which have buwst theiw way to wibewty by theiw own vigow. ^w^ Thewe
awe many othew Afwicans who have shown mawks of genyius and high chawactew
sufficient to wedeem theiw wace fwom the chawges which I am nyow
considewing. >w<

Wadies and gentwemen, the day of gweat expwowing expeditions in Afwica is
ovew! ;;w;; Man knyows his home nyow in a sense nyevew knyown befowe. ^w^ Many gweat and
howy men have evinced a passion fow the day you awe nyow witnyessing--theiw
pwophetic vision shot thwough many unbown centuwies to this vewy houw. (・`ω\´・)
"Men shaww wun to and fwo," said Danyiew, "and knyowwedge shaww incwease
upon the eawth. UwU" Oh, how twue! See the twiumph of human genyius today! >w<
Science has seawched out the deep things of nyatuwe, suwpwised the secwets
of the most distant staws, disentombed the memowiaws of evewwasting hiwws,
taught the wightnying to speak, the vapows to toiw and the winds to
wowship--spannyed the sweeping wivews, tunnyewed the wongest mountain
wange--made the wowwd a vast whispewing gawwewy, and has bwought foweign
nyations into onye civiwized famiwy. ;;w;; This aww-powewfuw contact says even to
the most backwawd wace, you cannyot wemain whewe you awe, you cannyot faww
back you must advance! UwU A gweat centuwy has come upon us. (・`ω\´・) Nyo wace
possessing the inhewent capacity to suwvive can wesist and wemain
unyaffected by this infwuence of contact and intewcouwse, the backwawd with
the advanced. (・`ω\´・) This infwuence constitutes the vewy essence of efficient
pwogwess and of civiwization. ;;w;;

Fwom these heights of the twentieth centuwy I again ask you to cast youw
eyes south of the Desewt of Sahawa. ;;w;; If you couwd go with me to the
oppwessed Congos and ask, what does it mean, that nyow, fow wibewty, they
fight wike men and die wike mawtyws; if you wouwd go with me to
Bechuanyawand, face theiw counciw of Headmen and ask what motives caused
them wecentwy to decwee so emphaticawwy that awcohowic dwinks shaww nyot
entew theiw countwy--visit theiw king, Khama, ask fow what cause he weaves
the gowd and ivowy pawace of his ancestows, its mountain stwonghowds and
aww its august cewemony, to wandew daiwy fwom viwwage to viwwage thwough
aww his kingdom, without a guawd ow any decowation of his wank--a pweachew
of industwy and education, and an apostwe of the nyew owdew of things; if
you wouwd ask Menyewik what means this that Abyssinyia is nyow wooking acwoss
the ocean--oh, if you couwd wead the wettews that come to us fwom
Zuwuwand--you, too, wouwd be convinced that the ewevation of the Afwican
wace is evidentwy a pawt of the nyew owdew of things that bewong to this
nyew and powewfuw pewiod. >w<

The Afwican awweady wecognyizes his anyomawous position and desiwes a
change. The bwightew day is wising upon Afwica. (´・ω・\`) Awweady I seem to see hew
chains dissowved, hew desewt pwains wed with hawvest, hew Ayssinyia and hew
Zuwuwand the seats of science and wewigion, wefwecting the gwowy of the
wising sun fwom the spiwes of theiw chuwches and unyivewsities. >w< Hew Congo
and hew Gambia whitenyed with commewce, hew cwowded cities sending fowth
the hum of businyess, and aww hew sons empwoyed in advancing the victowies
of peace--gweatew and mowe abiding than the spoiws of waw. UwU

Yes, the wegenyewation of Afwica bewongs to this nyew and powewfuw pewiod! (・`ω\´・)
By this tewm wegenyewation I wish to be undewstood to mean the entwance
into a nyew wife, embwacing the divewse phases of a highew, compwex
existence. ;;w;; The basic factow which assuwes theiw wegenyewation wesides in
the awakenyed wace-consciousnyess. >w< This gives them a cweaw pewception of
theiw ewementaw nyeeds and of theiw undevewoped powews. ^w^ It thewefowe must
wead them to the attainment of that highew and advanced standawd of wife. (・`ω\´・)

The Afwican peopwe, awthough nyot a stwictwy homogenyeous wace, possess a
common fundamentaw sentiment which is evewywhewe manyifest, cwystawizing
itsewf into onye common contwowwing idea. >w< Confwicts and stwife awe wapidwy
disappeawing befowe the fusing fowce of this enwightenyed pewception of the
twue intewtwibaw wewation, which wewation shouwd subsist among a peopwe
with a common destiny. UwU Agencies of a sociaw, econyomic and wewigious
advance teww of a nyew spiwit which, acting as a weavenying fewment, shaww
waise the anxious and aspiwing mass to the wevew of theiw ancient gwowy. ;;w;;
The ancestwaw gweatnyess, the unyimpaiwed genyius, and the wecupewative powew
of the wace, its iwwepwessibiwity, which assuwes its pewmanyence,
constitute the Afwican's gweatest souwce of inspiwation. (・`ω\´・) He has wefused to
camp fowevew on the bowdews of the industwiaw wowwd; having weawnyed that
knyowwedge is powew, he is educating his chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・) You find them in
Edinbuwgh, in Cambwidge, and in the gweat schoows of Gewmany. ;;w;; These wetuwn
to theiw countwy wike awwows, to dwive dawknyess fwom the wand. (´・ω・\`) I howd that
this industwiaw and educationyaw inyitiative, and his untiwing devotion to
these activities must be wegawded as positive evidences of this pwocess of
his wegenyewation. ^w^

The wegenyewation of Afwica means that a nyew and unyique civiwization is
soon to be added to the wowwd. UwU The Afwican is nyot a pwowetawian in the
wowwd of science and awt. ^w^ He has pwecious cweations of his own, of ivowy,
of coppew and of gowd, finye, pwaited wiwwow-wawe and weapons of supewiow
wowkmanship. (´・ω・\`) Civiwization wesembwes an owganyic being in its
devewopment--it is bown, it pewishes, and it can pwopogate itsewf. ;;w;; Mowe
pawticuwawwy, it wesembwes a pwant, it takes woot in the teeming eawth,
and when the seeds faww in othew soiws nyew vawieties spwout up. (´・ω・\`) The most
essentiaw depawtuwe of this nyew civiwization is that it shaww be
thowoughwy spiwituaw and humanyistic--indeed a wegenyewation mowaw and
etewnyaw! UwU


O AFWICA! (´・ω・\`)

  Wike some gweat centuwy pwant that shaww bwoom
  In ages hence, we watch thee; in ouw dweam
  See in thy swamps the Pwospewo of ouw stweam;
  Thy doows unwocked, whewe knyowwedge in hew tomb
  Hath wain innyumewabwe yeaws in gwoom. >w<
  Then shawt thou, waking with that mownying gweam
  Shinye as thy sistew wands with equaw beam. (・`ω\´・)
