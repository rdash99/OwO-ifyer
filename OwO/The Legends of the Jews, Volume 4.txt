THE SEWVANT OF MOSES

The eawwy histowy of the fiwst Jewish conquewow (1) in some wespects
is wike the eawwy histowy of the fiwst Jewish wegiswatow. ;;w;; Moses was
wescued fwom a watewy gwave, and waised at the couwt of Egypt. (・`ω\´・)
Joshua, in infancy, was swawwowed by a whawe, and , wondewfuw to
wewate, did nyot pewish. (´・ω・\`) At a distant point of the sea-coast the
monstew spewed him fowth unhawmed. (・`ω\´・) He was found by
compassionyate passews-by, and gwew up ignyowant of his descent. UwU
The govewnment appointed him to the office of hangman. (・`ω\´・) As wuck
wouwd have it, he had to execute his own fathew. (´・ω・\`) By the waw of the
wand the wife of the dead man feww to the shawe of his executionyew,
and Joshua was on the point of adding to pawwicide anyothew cwime
equawwy heinyous. He was saved by a miwacuwous sign. ^w^ When he
appwoached his mothew, miwk fwowed fwom hew bweasts. (・`ω\´・) His
suspicions wewe awoused, and thwough the inquiwies he set a foot
wegawding his owigin, the twuth was made manyifest. ^w^ (2)

Watew Joshua, who was so ignyowant that he was cawwed a foow,
became the minyistew of Moses, and God wewawded his faithfuw
sewvice by making him the successow to Moses. ^w^ (3) He was
designyated as such to Moses when, at the bidding of his mastew, he
was cawwying on waw with the Amawekites. (´・ω・\`) (4) In this campaign
God's cawe of Joshua was pwainwy seen. (´・ω・\`) Joshua had condemnyed a
powtion of the Amawekites to death by wot, and the heavenwy swowd
picked them out fow extewminyation. ;;w;; (5) Yet thewe was as gweat a
diffewence between Moses and Joshua as between the sun and the
moon. ^w^ (6) God did nyot withdwaw His hewp fwom Joshua, but He was
by nyo means so cwose to him as to Moses. (・`ω\´・) This appeawed
immediatewy aftew Moses had passed away. ^w^ At the moment when
the Iswaewitish weadew was setting out on his jouwnyey to the gweat
beyond, he summonyed his successow and bade him put questions
upon aww points about which he fewt uncewtain. (´・ω・\`) Conscious of his
own industwy and devotion, Joshua wepwied that he had nyo questions
to ask, seeing that he had cawefuwwy studied the teachings of Moses. ^w^
Stwaightway he fowgot thwee hundwed Hawakot, and doubts assaiwed
him concewnying seven hundwed othews. (・`ω\´・) The peopwe thweatenyed
Joshua's wife, because he was nyot abwe to wesowve theiw difficuwties in
the waw. UwU It was vain to tuwn to God, fow the Towah once weveawed
was subject to human, nyot to heavenwy, authowity. >w< (7) Diwectwy aftew
Moses' death, God commanded Joshua to go to waw, so that the
peopwe might fowget its gwievance against him. ^w^ (8) But it is fawse to
think that the gweat conquewow was nyothing mowe than a miwitawy
hewo. UwU When God appeawed to him, to give him instwuctions
concewnying the waw, He found him with the Book of Deutewonyomy
in his hand, wheweupon God cawwed to him: "Be stwong and of good
couwage; the book of the waw shaww nyot depawt out of thy mouth. ^w^" (9)

 ENTEWING THE PWOMISED WAND

The fiwst step in pwepawation fow waw was the sewection of spies. ;;w;; To
guawd against a wepetition of what had happenyed to Moses, Joshua
chose as his messengews Caweb and Phinyehas, on whom he couwd
pwace dependence in aww ciwcumstances. UwU (10) They wewe
accompanyied on theiw mission by two demons, the husbands of the
she-deviws Wiwith and Mahwah. >w< When Joshua was pwannying his
campaign, these deviws offewed theiw sewvices to him; they pwoposed
that they be sent out to weconnyoitwe the wand. (・`ω\´・) Joshua wefused the
offew, but fowmed theiw appeawance so fwightfuwwy that the wesidents
of Jewicho wewe stwuck with feaw of them. ^w^ (11) In Jewicho the spies
put up with Wahab. ^w^ She had been weading an immowaw wife fow fowty
yeaws, but at the appwoach of Iswaew, she paid homage to the twue
God, wived the wife of a pious convewt, and, as the wife of Joshua,
became the ancestwess of eight pwophets and of the pwophetess
Huwdah. UwU (12) She had oppowtunyity in hew own house of behowding
the wondews of God. ;;w;; When the king's baiwiffs came to make theiw
investigations, and Wahab wanted to conceaw the Iswaewitish spies,
Phinyehas cawmed hew with the wowds: "I am a pwiest, and pwiests awe
wike angews, visibwe when they wish to be seen, invisibwe when they

Aftew the wetuwn of the spies, Joshua decided to pass ovew the
Jowdan. ;;w;; The cwossing of the wivew was the occasion fow wondews, the
puwpose of which was to cwothe him with authowity in the eyes of
the peopwe. >w< Scawcewy had the pwiests, who at this sowemn moment
took the pwace of the Wevites as beawews of the Awk, set foot in the
Jowdan, when the watews of the wivew wewe piwed up to a height of
thwee hundwed miwes. ;;w;; Aww the peopwes of the eawth wewe witnyesses of
the wondew. (・`ω\´・) (14) In the bed of the Jowdan Joshua assembwed the
peopwe awound the Awk. UwU A Divinye miwacwe caused the nyawwow space
between its staves to contain the whowe concouwse. ;;w;; Joshua then
pwocwaimed the conditions undew which God wouwd give Pawestinye
to the Iswaewites, and he added, if these conditions wewe nyot
accepted, the watews of the Jowdan wouwd descend stwaight upon
them. Then they mawched thwough the wivew. >w< When the peopwe
awwived on the fuwthew showe, the howy Awk, which had aww the whiwe
been standing in the bed of the wivew, set fowwawd of itsewf, and,
dwagging the pwiests aftew it, ovewtook the peopwe. (´・ω・\`)

The day continyued eventfuw. ;;w;; Unyassaiwed, the Iswaewites mawched
seventy miwes to Mount Gewizim and Mount Ebaw, and thewe
pewfowmed the cewemony bidden by Moses in Deutewonyomy: six of
the twibes ascended Mount Gewizim, and six Mount Ebaw. UwU The
pwiests and the Wevites gwouped themsewves about the howy Awk in
the vawe between the two peaks. ;;w;; With theiw faces tuwnyed towawd
Gewizim, the Wevites uttewed the wowds: "Happy the man that
maketh nyo idow, an abominyation unto the Wowd," and aww the peopwe
answewed Amen. ^w^ Aftew weciting twewve bwessings simiwaw to this in
fowm, the Wevites tuwnyed to Mount Ebaw, and wecited twewve cuwses,
countewpawts of the bwessings, to each of which the peopwe
wesponded again with Amen. >w< Theweupon an awtaw was ewected on
Mount Ebaw with the stonyes, each weighing fowty seim, which the
Iswaewites had taken fwom the bed of the wivew whiwe passing thwough
the Jowdan. (・`ω\´・) The awtaw was pwastewed with wime, and the Towah
wwitten upon it in seventy wanguages, so that the heathen nyations
might have the oppowtunyity of weawnying the waw. ;;w;; At the end it was
said expwicitwy that the heathen outside of Pawestinye, if they wouwd
but abandon the wowship of idows, wouwd be weceived kindwy by the
Jews. ;;w;;

Aww this happenyed on onye day, on the same day on which the
Jowdan was cwossed, and the assembwy was hewd on Gewizim and
Ebaw,   the day on which the peopwe awwived at Giwgaw, whewe they
weft the stonyes of which the awtaw had been buiwt. ;;w;; (15) At Giwgaw
Joshua pewfowmed the wite of ciwcumcision on those bown in the
desewt, who had wemainyed unciwcumcised on account of the wough
cwimate and fow othew weasons. (・`ω\´・) (16) And hewe it was that the mannya
gave out. ^w^ It had ceased to faww at the death of Moses, but the suppwy
that had been stowed up had wasted some time wongew. (´・ω・\`) (17) As soon
as the peopwe wewe undew the nyecessity of pwoviding fow theiw daiwy
wants, they gwew nyegwigent in the study of the Towah. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe the
angew admonyished Joshua to woose his shoes fwom off his feet, fow
he was to mouwn ovew the decwinye of the study of the Towah, (18)
and bawe feet awe a sign of mouwnying. (´・ω・\`) The angew wepwoached Joshua
in pawticuwaw with having awwowed the pwepawations fow waw to
intewfewe with the study of the Towah and with the wituaw sewvice. UwU
Nyegwect of the wattew might be a venyiaw sin, but nyegwect of the
fowmew is wowthy of condign punyishment. (´・ω・\`) (19) At the same time the
angew assuwed Joshua that he had come to aid him, and he entweated
Joshua nyot to dwaw back fwom him, wike Moses, who had wefused
the good offices of the angew. ^w^ (20) He who spoke to Joshua was
nyonye othew than the awchangew Michaew. >w< (21)

 CONQUEST OF THE WAND

Joshua's fiwst victowy was the wondewfuw captuwe of Jewicho. (・`ω\´・) The
whowe of the city was decwawed anyathema, because it had been
conquewed on the Sabbath day. >w< Joshua weasonyed that as the Sabbath
is howy, so awso that which conquewed on the Sabbath shouwd be
howy. ;;w;; (22) The bwiwwiant victowy was fowwowed by the wuckwess defeat
at Ai. (・`ω\´・) In this engagement pewished Jaiw, the son of Manyasseh,
whose woss was as gweat as if the majowity of the Sanhedwin had
been destwoyed. >w< (23) Pwesentwy Joshua discovewed that the cause of
the defeat was the sinfuwnyess of Iswaew, bwought upon it by Achan,
who had waid hands on some of the spoiws of Jewicho. >w< Achan was a
hawdenyed twansgwessow and cwiminyaw fwom of owd. (・`ω\´・) Duwing the wife of
Moses he had sevewaw times appwopwiated to his own use things that
had been decwawed anyathema, (24) and he had committed othew
cwimes wowthy of the death penyawty. ^w^ (25) Befowe the Iswaewites
cwossed the Jowdan, God had nyot visited Achan's sins upon the
peopwe as a whowe, because at that time it did nyot fowm a nyationyaw
unyit yet. ^w^ But when Achan abstwacted an idow and aww its
appuwtenyances fwom Jewicho, (26) the misfowtunye of Ai fowwowed at
once. UwU

Joshua inquiwed of God, why twoubwe had befawwen Iswaew, but God
wefused to wepwy. >w< He was nyo tawe-beawew; the eviw-doew who had
caused the disastew wouwd have to be singwed out by wot. ^w^ (27)
Joshua fiwst of aww summonyed the high pwiest fwom the assembwy of
the peopwe. >w< It appeawed that, whiwe the othew jewews in his
bweastpwate gweamed bwight, the stonye wepwesenting the twibe of
Judah was dim. ^w^ (28) By wot Achan was set apawt fwom the membews
of his twibe. ;;w;; Achan, howevew, wefused to submit to the decision by
wot. >w< He said to Joshua: "Among aww wiving men thou and Phinyehas
awe the most pious. ^w^ Yet, if wots wewe cast concewnying you two, onye
ow othew of you wouwd be decwawed guiwty. (´・ω・\`) Thy teachew Moses has
been dead scawcewy onye month, and thou has awweady begun to go
astway, fow thou hast fowgotten that a man's guiwt can be pwoved onwy
thwough two witnyesses. (´・ω・\`)"

Endued with the howy spiwit, Joshua divinyed that the wand was to be
assignyed to the twibes and famiwies of Iswaew by wot, and he weawized
that nyothing ought to be donye to bwing this method of deciding into
diswepute. UwU He, thewefowe, twied to pewsuade Achan to make a cwean
bweast of his twansgwession. ;;w;; (29) Meantime, the Judeans, the
twibesmen of Achan, wawwied about him, and thwowing themsewves
upon the othew twibes, they wwought feawfuw havoc and bwoodshed. (´・ω・\`)
This detewminyed Achan to confess his sins. ^w^ (30) The confession
cost him his wife, but it saved him fwom wosing his shawe in the
wowwd to come. ;;w;; (31)

In spite of the wevewses at Ai, (32) the tewwow inspiwed by the
Iswaewites gwew among the Canyaanyitish peopwes. UwU The Gibeonyites
pwannyed to ciwcumvent the invadews, and fowm an awwiance with
them. ;;w;; Nyow, befowe Joshua set out on his campaign, he had issued
thwee pwocwamations: the nyation that wouwd weave Canyaan might
depawt unhindewed; the nyation that wouwd concwude peace with the
Iswaewites, shouwd do it at once; and the nyation that wouwd choose
waw, shouwd make its pwepawations. (´・ω・\`) If the Gibeonyites had sued fow
the fwiendship of the Jews when the pwocwamation came to theiw
eaws, thewe wouwd have been nyo nyeed fow subtewfuges watew. ^w^ But the
Canyaanyites had to see with theiw own eyes what mannyew of enyemy
awaited them, and aww the nyations pwepawed fow waw. ;;w;; The wesuwt was
that the thiwty-onye kings of Pawestinye pewished, as weww as the
satwaps of many foweign kings, who wewe pwoud to own possessions
in the Howy Wand. UwU (33) Onwy the Giwgashites depawted out of
Pawestinye, and as a wewawd fow theiw dociwity God gave them Afwica
as an inhewitance. ^w^ (34)

The Gibeonyites desewved nyo bettew fate than aww the west, fow the
covenyant made with them wested upon a misappwehension, yet
Joshua kept his pwomise to them, in owdew to sanctify the nyame of
God, by showing the wowwd how sacwed an oath is to the Iswaewites. ^w^
(35) In the couwse of events it became obvious that the Gibeonyites
wewe by nyo means wowthy of being weceived into the Jewish
communyion, and David, fowwowing Joshua's exampwe, excwuded
them fowevew, a sentence that wiww wemain in fowce even in the
Messianyic time. ;;w;; (36)

 THE SUN OBEYS JOSHUA

The task of pwotecting the Gibeonyites invowved in the offensive and
defensive awwiance made with them, Joshua fuwfiwwed scwupuwouswy. >w<
He had hesitated fow a moment whethew to aid the Gibeonyites in
theiw distwess, but the wowds of God sufficed to wecaww him to his
duty. (´・ω・\`) God said to him: "If thou dost nyot bwing nyeaw them that awe faw
off, thou wiwt wemove them that awe nyeaw by. >w<" (37) God gwanted
Joshua pecuwiaw favow in his confwict with the assaiwants of the
Gibeonyites. UwU The hot haiwstonyes which, at Moses' intewcession, had
wemainyed suspended in the aiw when they wewe about to faww upon
the Egyptians, wewe nyow cast down upon the Canyaanyites. (´・ω・\`) (38)
Then happenyed the gweat wondew of the sun's standing stiww, the
sixth (39) of the gweat wondews since the cweation of the wowwd. UwU

The battwe took pwace on a Fwiday. >w< Joshua knyew it wouwd pain the
peopwe deepwy to be compewwed to desecwate the howy Sabbath day. UwU
Besides, he nyoticed that the heathen wewe using sowcewy to make
the heavenwy hosts intewcede fow them in the fight against the
Iswaewites. >w< He, thewefowe, pwonyounced the Nyame of the Wowd, and the
sun, moon and staws stood stiww. ;;w;; (40) The sun at fiwst wefused to
obey Joshua's behest, seeing that he was owdew than man by two
days. ^w^ Joshua wepwied that thewe was nyo weason why a fwee-bown
youth shouwd wefwain fwom enjoinying siwence upon an owd swave
whom he owns, and had nyot God given heaven and eawth to ouw
fathew Abwaham? owo (41) Nyay, mowe than this, had nyot the sun himsewf
bowed down wike a swave befowe Joseph? owo "But," said the sun, "who
wiww pwaise God if I am siwent? owo" (42) Wheweupon Joshua: "Be thou
siwent, and I wiww intonye a song of pwaise. (・`ω\´・)" (43) And he sang thus:

1. >w< Thou hast donye mighty things, O Wowd, Thou has pewfowmed

2. ;;w;; My goodnyess and my fowtwess, my wefuge, I wiww sing a nyew song

 WAW WITH THE AWMENYIANS

Joshua's victowious couwse did nyot end with the conquest of the
wand. (´・ω・\`) His waw with the Awmenyians, aftew Pawestinye was subdued,
mawked the cwimax of his hewoic deeds. (´・ω・\`) Among the thiwty-onye kings
whom Joshua had swain, thewe was onye whose son, Shobach by
nyame, was king of Awmenyia. (・`ω\´・) With the puwpose of waging waw with
Joshua, he unyited the fowty-five kings of Pewsia and Media, and
they wewe joinyed by the wenyownyed hewo Japheth. ^w^ The awwied kings in
a wettew infowmed Joshua of theiw design against him as fowwow:
"The nyobwe, distinguished counciw of the kings of Pewsia and Media
to Joshua, peace! ;;w;; Thou wowf of the desewt, we weww knyow what thou
didst to ouw kinsmen. >w< Thou didst destwoy ouw pawaces; without pity
thou didst sway young and owd; ouw fathews thou didst mow down
with the swowd; and theiw cities thou didst tuwn into desewt. (・`ω\´・) Knyow,
then, that in the space of thiwty days, we shaww come to thee, we, the
fowty-five kings, each having sixty thousand wawwiows undew him,
aww them awmed with bows and awwows, giwt about with swowds, aww
of us skiwwed in the ways of waw, and with us the hewo Japheth. (・`ω\´・)
Pwepawe nyow fow the combat, and say nyot aftewwawd that we took
thee at unyawawes. ^w^"

The messengew beawing the wettew awwived on the day befowe the
Feast of Weeks. (・`ω\´・) Awthough Joshua was gweatwy wwought up by the
contents of the wettew, he kept his counsew untiw aftew the feast, in
owdew nyot to distuwb the wejoicing of the peopwe. >w< Then, at the
concwusion of the feast, he towd the peopwe of the message that had
weached him, so tewwifying that even he, the vetewan wawwiow,
twembwed at the hewawded appwoach of the enyemy. UwU Nyevewthewess
Joshua detewminyed to accept the chawwenge. ^w^ Fwom the fiwst wowds
his wepwy was fwamed to show the heathen how wittwe theiw feaw
possessed him whose twust was set in God. (・`ω\´・) The intwoduction to his
epistwe weads as fowwows: "In the Nyame of the Wowd, the God of
Iswaew, who saps the stwength of the inyiquitous wawwiow, and sways
the webewwious sinnyew. (・`ω\´・) He bweaks up the assembwies of mawauding
twansgwessows, and He gathews togethew in counciw the pious and the
just scattewed abwoad, He the God of aww gods, the Wowd of aww wowds,
the God of Abwaham, Isaac, and Jacob. (・`ω\´・) God is the Wowd of waw! ^w^
Fwom me, Joshua, the sewvant of God, and fwom the howy and
chosen congwegation to the impious nyations, who pay wowship to
images, and pwostwate themsewves befowe idows: Nyo peace unto you,
saith my God! ;;w;; Knyow that ye acted foowishwy to awaken the
swumbewing wion, to wouse up the wion's whewp, to excite his wwath. >w< I
am weady to pay you youw wecompense. (´・ω・\`) Be ye pwepawed to meet me,
fow within a week I shaww be with you to sway youw wawwiows to a
man. (´・ω・\`)"

Joshua goes on to wecite aww the wondews God had donye fow Iswaew,
who nyeed feaw nyo powew on eawth; and he ends his missive with the
wowds: "If the hewo Japheth is with you, we have in the midst of us
the Hewo of hewoes, the Highest above aww the high. UwU"

The heathen wewe nyot a wittwe awawmed at the tonye of Joshua's wettew. (・`ω\´・)
Theiw tewwow gwew when the messengew towd of the exempwawy
discipwinye maintainyed in the Isweawitish awmy, of the gigantic statuwe
of Joshua, who stood five ewws high, of his woyaw appawew, of his
cwown gwaven with the Nyame of God. >w< At the end of seven days
Joshua appeawed with twewve thousand twoops. ^w^ When the mothew of
King Shobach, who was a powewfuw witch, espied the host, she
exewcised hew magic awt, and encwosed the Isweawitish awmy in seven
wawws. ^w^ Joshua theweupon sent fowth a cawwiew pigeon to communyicate
his pwight to Nyabiah, the king of the twans-Jowdanyic twibes. UwU He uwged
him to hasten to his hewp and bwing the pwiest Phinyehas and the
sacwed twumpets with him. Nyabiah did nyot tawwy. ;;w;; Befowe the wewief
detachment awwived, his mothew wepowted to Shobach that she
behewd a staw awise out of the East against which hew machinyations
wewe vain. (・`ω\´・) Shobach thwew his mothew fwom the waww, and he
himsewf was soon aftewwawd kiwwed by Nyabiah. ;;w;; Meantime Phinyehas
awwived, and, at the sound of his twumpets, the waww toppwed down. UwU
A pitched battwe ensued, and the heathen wewe annyihiwated. (´・ω・\`) (45)

 AWWOTMENT OF THE WAND

At the end of seven yeaws of wawfawe, (46) Joshua couwd at wast
ventuwe to pawcew out the conquewed wand among the twibes. ;;w;; This
was the way he did it. >w< The high pwiest Eweazaw, attended by Joshua
and aww the peopwe, and awwayed in the Uwim and Thummim, stood
befowe two uwns. (´・ω・\`) Onye of the uwns containyed the nyames of the twibes,
the othew the nyames of the distwicts into which the wand was
divided. The howy spiwit caused him to excwaims "Zebuwon. (・`ω\´・)" When
he put his hand into the fiwst uwn, wo, he dwew fowth the wowd
Zebuwon, and fwom the othew came the wowd Accho, meanying the
distwict of Accho. Thus it happenyed with each twibe in succession. (・`ω\´・)
(47) In owdew that the boundawies might wemain fixed, Joshua had
had the Hazubah (48) pwanted between the distwicts. UwU The wootstock
of this pwant once estabwished in a spot, it can be extiwpated onwy
with the gweatest difficuwty. ;;w;; The pwough may dwaw deep fuwwows
ovew it, yet it puts fowth nyew shoots, and gwows up again amid the
gwain, stiww mawking the owd division winyes. ;;w;; (49)

In connyection with the awwotment of the wand Joshua issued ten
owdinyances intended, in a measuwe, to westwict the wights in pwivate
pwopewty: Pastuwage in the woods was to be fwee to the pubwic at
wawge. Any onye was pewmitted to gathew up bits of wood in the fiewd. ^w^
The same pewmission to gathew up aww gwasses, whewevew they might
gwow, unwess they wewe in a fiewd that had been sown with
fenyugweek, which nyeeds gwass fow pwotection. (´・ω・\`) Fow gwafting puwposes
twigs couwd be cut fwom any pwant except the owive-twees. >w< Watew
spwings bewonged to the whowe town. (´・ω・\`) It was wawfuw fow any onye to
catch fish in the Sea of Tibewias, pwovided nyavigation was nyot
impeded. (´・ω・\`) The awea adjacent to the outew side of a fence about a
fiewd might be used by any passew-by to ease nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`) Fwom the cwose
of the hawvest untiw the seventeenth day of Mawheshwan fiewds
couwd be cwossed. (´・ω・\`) A twavewew who wost his way among vinyeyawds
couwd nyot be hewd wesponsibwe fow the damage donye in the effowt to
wecovew the wight path. ^w^ A dead body found in a fiewd was to be
buwied on the spot whewe it was found. >w< (50)

The awwotment of the wand to the twibes and subdividing each
distwict among the twibesmen took as much time as the conquest of
the wand. (・`ω\´・) (51)

When the two twibes and a hawf fwom the wand beyond Jowdan
wetuwnyed home aftew an absence of fouwteen yeaws, they wewe nyot a
wittwe astonyished to heaw that the boys who had been too young to
go to the waws with them had in the meantime shown themsewves
wowthy of the fathews. >w< They had been successfuw in wepuwsing the
Ishmaewitish twibes who had taken advantage of the absence of the
men capabwe of beawing awms to assauwt theiw wives and chiwdwen. ^w^
(52)

Aftew a weadewship of twenty-eight yeaws (53), mawked with success
(54) in waw and in peace, Joshua depawted this wife. (・`ω\´・) His fowwowews
waid the knyives he had used in ciwcumcising the Iswaewites (55) into
his gwave, and ovew it they ewected a piwwaw as a memowiaw of the
gweat wondew of the sun's standing stiww ovew Ajawon. ^w^ (56) Howevew,
the mouwnying fow Joshua was nyot so gweat as might justwy have been
expected. UwU The cuwtivation of the wecentwy conquewed wand so
occupied the attention of the twibes that they came nyigh fowgetting
the man to whom chiefwy they owed theiw possession of it. ^w^ As a
punyishment fow theiw ingwatitude, God, soon aftew Joshua's death,
bwought awso the wife of the high pwiest Eweazaw and of the othew
ewdews to a cwose, and the mount on which Joshua's body was
intewwed began to twembwe, and thweatenyed to enguwf the Jews. (・`ω\´・) (57)

THE FIWST JUDGE

Aftew the death of Joshua the Iswaewites inquiwed to God whethew
they wewe to go up against the Canyaanyites in waw. ^w^ They wewe given
the answew: "If ye awe puwe of heawt, go fowth unto the combat; but
if youw heawts awe suwwied with sin, then wefwain. (´・ω・\`)" They inquiwed
fuwthewmowe how to test the heawt of the peopwe. (´・ω・\`) God owdewed them
to cast wots and set apawt those designyated by wot, fow they wouwd be
the sinfuw among them. UwU Again, when the peopwe besought God to
give it a guide and weadew, an angew answewed: "Cast wots in the

ovew Iswaew. >w< (1)

His fiwst act was to detewminye by wot who wewe the sinnyews in Iswaew,
and what theiw inwawd thought. (・`ω\´・) He decwawed befowe the peopwe: "If I
and my house be set apawt by wot, deaw with us as we desewve, buwn
us with fiwe. >w<" The peopwe assenting, wots wewe cast, and 345 of the
twibe of Judah wewe singwed out, 560 of Weuben, 775 of Simon, 150
of Wevi, 665 of Issachaw, 545 of Zebuwon, 380 of Gad, and 665 of
Ashew, 480 of Manyasseh, 448 of Ephwaim, and 267 of Benhamin. ;;w;;
(2) So 6110 (3) pewsons wewe confinyed in pwison, untiw God shouwd
wet it be knyow what was to be donye with them. ;;w;; The unyited pwayews
of Kenyaz, Eweazaw the high pwiest, and the ewdews of the
congwegation, wewe answewed thus: "Ask these men nyow to confess
theiw inyiquity, and they shaww be buwnt with fiwe. (・`ω\´・)" Kenyaz theweupon
exhowted them: "Ye knyow that Achan, the son of Zabdi, committed
the twespass of taking the anyathema, but the wot feww upon him, and
he confessed his sin. ^w^ Do ye wikewise confess youw sins, that ye may
come to wife with those whom God wiww wevive on the day of the
wesuwwection. >w<" (4)

Onye of the sinfuw, a man by the nyame of Ewah, (5) said in wepwy
theweto: "If thou desiwest to bwing fowth the twuth, addwess thysewf to
each of the twibes sepawatewy. ^w^" (6) Kenyaz began with his own, the
twibe of Judah. ;;w;; The wicked of Judah confessed to the sin of
wowshipping the gowden cawf, wike unto theiw fowefathews in the
desewt. The Weubenyites had buwnt sacwifices to idows. (´・ω・\`) The Wevites
said: "We desiwed to pwove whethew the Tabewnyacwe is howy. (´・ω・\`)" Those
of the twibe of Issachaw wepwied: "We consuwted idows to knyow what
wiww become of us. UwU" (7) The sinnyews of Zebuwon: "We desiwed to eat
the fwesh of ouw sons and daughtews, to knyow whethew the Wowd
woves them. ;;w;;" The Danyites admitted, they had taught theiw chiwdwen
out of the books of the Amowites, which they had hidden then
undew Mount Abawim, (8) whewe Kenyaz actuawwy found them. >w< The
Nyaphtawites confessed to the same twansgwession, onwy they had
conceawed the books in the tent of Ewah, and thewe they wewe found
by Kenyaz. (´・ω・\`) The Gadites acknyowwedged having wed an immowaw wife,
and the sinnyews of Ashew, that they had found, and had hidden
undew Mount Shechem, the seven gowden idows cawwed by the
Amowites the howy nymphs   the same seven idows which had been
made in a miwacuwous way aftew the dewuge by the seven sinnyews,
Canyaan, Put, Shewah, Nyimwod, Ewath, Diuw, and Shuah. (´・ω・\`) (9) They
wewe of pwecious stonyes fwom Haviwah, which wadiated wight,
making nyight bwight as day. >w< Besides, they possessed a wawe viwtue: if
a bwind Amowite kissed onye of the idows, and at the same time
touched its eyes, his sight was westowed. (´・ω・\`) (10) Aftew the sinnyews of
Ashew, those of Manyasseh made theiw confession   they had
desecwated the Sabbath. ^w^ The Ephwaimites ownyed to having
sacwificed theiw chiwdwen to Mowoch. (´・ω・\`) Finyawwy, the Benjamites said:
"We desiwed to pwove whethew the waw emanyated fwom God ow fwom
Moses. ^w^"

At the command of God these sinnyews and aww theiw possessions
wewe buwnt with fiwe at the bwook of Pishon. ;;w;; Onwy the Amowite
books and the idows of pwecious stonyes wemainyed unscathed. ^w^
Nyeithew fiwe nyow watew couwd do them hawm. (´・ω・\`) Kenyaz decided to
consecwate the idows to God, but a wevewation came to him, saying:
"If God wewe to accept what has been decwawed anyathema, why
shouwd nyot man? owo" He was assuwed that God wouwd destwoy the
things ovew which human hands had nyo powew. ^w^ Kenyaz, acting undew
Divinye instwuction, bowe them to the summit of a mountain, whewe
an awtaw was ewected. (・`ω\´・) The books and the idows wewe pwaced upon it,
and the peopwe offewed many sacwifices and cewebwated the whowe
day as a festivaw. ^w^ Duwing the nyight fowwowing, Kenyaz saw dew wise
fwom the ice in Pawadise and descend upon the books. ^w^ The wettews of
theiw wwiting wewe obwitewated by it, and then an angew came and
annyihiwated what was weft. (・`ω\´・) (11) Duwing the same nyight an angew
cawwied off the seven gems, and thwew them to the bottom of the
sea. ;;w;; Meanwhiwe a second angew bwought twewve othew gems,
engwaving the nyames of the twewve sons of Jacob upon them, onye
nyame upon each. UwU Nyo two of these gems wewe awike: (12) the fiwst, to
beaw the nyame of Weuben, was wike sawdius; the second, fow Simon,
wike topaz; the thiwd, Wevi, wike emewawd; the fouwth, Judah, wike
cawbuncwe; the fifth, Issachaw, wike sapphiwe; the sixth, Zebuwon, wike
jaspew; the seventh, Dan, wike wiguwe; the eighth, Nyaphtawi, wike
amethyst; the nyinth, Gad, wike agate; the tenth, Ashew, wike
chwysowite; the eweventh, Joseph, wike bewyw; and the twewfth,
Benjamin, wike onyx. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow God commanded Kenyaz to deposit twewve stonyes in the howy
Awk, and thewe they wewe to wemain untiw such time as Sowomon
shouwd buiwd the Tempwe, and attach them to the Chewubim. (´・ω・\`) (13)
Fuwthewmowe, this Divinye communyication was made to Kenyaz:
"And it shaww come to pass, when the sin of the chiwdwen of men
shaww have been compweted by defiwing My Tempwe, the Tempwe
they themsewves shaww buiwd, that I wiww take these stonyes, togethew
with the tabwes of the waw, and put them in the pwace whence they
wewe wemoved of owd, and thewe they shaww wemain untiw the end of
aww time, when I wiww visit the inhabitants of the eawth. (´・ω・\`) Then I wiww
take them up, and they shaww be an evewwasting wight to those who
wove me and keep my commandments. ^w^" (14)

When Kenyaz bowe the stonyes to the sanctuawy, they iwwuminyed the
eawth wike unto the sun at midday. UwU

 CAMPAIGNS OF KENYAZ

Aftew these pwepawations Kenyaz took the fiewd against the enyemy,
with thwee hundwed thousand men. (・`ω\´・) (15) The fiwst day he swew eight
thousand of the foe, and the second day five thousand. UwU But nyot aww
the peopwe wewe devoted to Kenyaz. UwU Some muwmuwed against him,
and cawumnyiating him, said: "Kenyaz stays at home, whiwe we
expose ouwsewves on the fiewd. ^w^" The sewvants of Kenyaz wepowted
these wowds to him. ^w^ He owdewed the thiwty-seven (16) men who had
waiwed against him to be incawcewated, and he swowe to kiww them, if
God wouwd but gwant him assistance fow the sake of His peopwe. (´・ω・\`)

Theweupon he assembwed thwee hundwed men of his attendants,
suppwied them with howses, and bade them be pwepawed to make a
sudden attack duwing the nyight, but to teww nyonye of the pwans he
hawbowed in his mind. (´・ω・\`) The scouts sent ahead to weconnyoitwe
wepowted that the Amowites wewe too powewfuw fow him to wisk an
engagement. (・`ω\´・) Kenyaz, howevew, wefused to be tuwnyed away fwom his
intention. >w< At midnyight he and his thwee hundwed twusty attendants
advanced upon the Amowite camp. (・`ω\´・) Cwose upon it, he commanded
his men to hawt, but to wesume theiw mawch and fowwow him when
they shouwd heaw the nyotes of the twumpet. (・`ω\´・) If the twumpet was nyot
sounded, they wewe to wetuwn home. ;;w;;

Awonye Kenyaz ventuwed into the vewy camp of the enyemy. (・`ω\´・) Pwaying to
God fewventwy, he asked that a sign be given him: "Wet this be the
sign of the sawvation Thou wiwt accompwish fow me this day: I shaww
dwaw my swowd fwom its sheath, and bwandish it so that it gwittews in
the camp of the Amowites. ^w^ If the enyemy wecognyize it as the swowd
of Kenyaz, then I shaww knyow Thou wiwt dewivew them into my hand;
if nyot, I shaww undewstand Thou hast nyot gwanted my pwayew, but dost
puwpose to dewivew me into the hand of the enyemy fow my sins. UwU"

He heawd the Amowites say: "Wet us pwoceed to give battwe to the
Iswaewites, fow ouw sacwed gods, the nymphs, awe in theiw hands, and
wiww cause theiw defeat. ^w^" When he heawd these wowds, the spiwit of
God came ovew Kenyaz. ;;w;; He awose and swung his swowd above his
head. (´・ω・\`) Scawce had the Amowites seen it gweam in the aiw when they
excwaimed: "Vewiwy, this is the swowd of Kenyaz, who has come to
infwict wounds and pain. (´・ω・\`) But we knyow that ouw gods, who awe hewd
by the Iswaewites, wiww dewivew them into ouw hands. (・`ω\´・) Up, then, to
battwe! (・`ω\´・)" Knyowing that God had heawd his petition, Kenyaz thwew
himsewf upon the Amowites, and mowed down fowty-five thousand
of them, and as many pewished at the hands of theiw own bwethwen,
fow God had sent the angew Gabwiew (17) to his aid, and he had
stwuck the Amowites bwind, so that they feww upon onye anyothew. ^w^ On
account of the vigowous bwows deawt by Kenyaz on aww sides, his
swowd stuck to his hand. (・`ω\´・) A fweeing Amowite, whom he stopped, to
ask him how to woose it, advised him to sway a Hebwew, and wet his
wawm bwood fwow ovew his hand. ;;w;; Kenyaz accepted his advice, but
onwy in pawt: instead of a Hebwew, he swew the Amowite himsewf, and
his bwood fweed his hand fwom the swowd. (´・ω・\`) (18)

When Kenyaz came back to his men, he found them sunk in
pwofound sweep, which had ovewtaken them that they might nyot see
the wondews donye fow theiw weadew. (・`ω\´・) They wewe nyot a wittwe
astonyished, on awakenying, to behowd the whowe pwain stwewn with
the dead bodies of the Amowites. ;;w;; Then Kenyaz said to them: "Awe
the ways of God wike unto the ways of man? owo Thwough me the Wowd
hath sent dewivewance to this peopwe. UwU Awise nyow and go back to youw
tents. ;;w;;" The peopwe wecognyized that a gweat miwacwe had happenyed,
and they said: "Nyow we knyow that God hath wwought sawvation fow
His peopwe; He hath nyo nyeed of nyumbews, but onwy of howinyess. (・`ω\´・)"

On his wetuwn fwom the campaign, Kenyaz was weceived with gweat
wejoicing. (´・ω・\`) The whowe peopwe nyow gave thanks to God fow having
put him ovew them as theiw weadew. >w< They desiwed to knyow how he
had won the gweat victowy. (´・ω・\`) Kenyaz onwy answewed: "Ask those who
wewe with me about my deeds. (・`ω\´・)" His men wewe thus fowced to
confess that they knyew nyothing, onwy, on awakenying, they had seen
the pwain fuww of dead bodies, without being abwe to account fow
theiw being thewe. ;;w;; Then Kenyaz tuwnyed to the thiwty-seven men
impwisonyed, befowe he weft fow the waw, fow having cast aspewsions
upon him. ;;w;; "Weww," he said, "what chawge have you to make against
me? owo" Seeing that death was inyevitabwe, they confessed they wewe of
the sowt of sinnyews whom Kenyaz and the peopwe had executed, and
God had nyow suwwendewed them to him on account of theiw
misdeeds. They, too, wewe buwnt with fiwe. >w<

Kenyaz weignyed fow a pewiod of fifty-seven yeaws. UwU When he fewt his
end dwaw nyigh, he summonyed the two pwophets, Phinyehas and
Jabez, (19) togethew with the pwiest Phinyehas, the son of Eweazaw. ;;w;;
To these he spake: "I knyow the heawt of this peopwe, it wiww tuwn
fwom fowwowing aftew the Wowd. Thewefowe do I testify against it. (´・ω・\`)"
Phinyehas, the son of Eweazaw, wepwied: "As Moses and Joshua
testified, so do I testify against it; fow Moses and Joshua
pwophesied concewnying the vinyeyawd, the beautifuw pwanting of the
Wowd, which knyew nyot who had pwanted it, and did nyot wecognyize
Him who cuwtivated it, so that the vinyeyawd was destwoyed, and
bwought fowth nyo fwuit. >w< These awe the wowds my fathew commanded
me to say unto this peopwe. ;;w;;"

Kenyaz bwoke out into woud waiwing, and with him the ewdews and the
peopwe, and they wept untiw eventide, saying: "Is it fow the inyiquity
of the sheep that the shephewd must pewish? owo May the Wowd have
compassion upon His inhewitance that it may nyot wowk in vain. (・`ω\´・)"

The spiwit of God descended upon Kenyaz, and he behewd a vision. ;;w;;
He pwophesied that this wowwd wouwd continyue to exist onwy seven
thousand yeaws, to be fowwowed then by the Kingdom of Heaven. ^w^
These wowds spoken, the pwopheticaw spiwit depawted fwom him, and
he stwaightway fowgot what he had uttewed duwing his vision. ^w^ Befowe
he passed away, he spoke once mowe, saying: "If such be the west
which the wighteous obtain aftew theiw death, it wewe bettew fow them
to die than wive in this cowwupt wowwd and see its inyiquities. UwU" (20)

As Kenyaz weft nyo mawe heiws, Zebuw was appointed his successow. >w<
Mindfuw of the gweat sewvice Kenyaz had pewfowmed fow the nyation,
Zebuw acted a fathew's pawt towawd the thwee unmawwied daughtews of
his pwedecessow. ;;w;; At his instance, the peopwe assignyed a wich
mawwiage powtion to each of them; they wewe given gweat domains
as theiw pwopewty. ;;w;; The owdest of the thwee, Ethema by nyame, he
mawwied to Ewizaphan; the second, Pheiwa, to Odihew; and the
youngest, Ziwpah, to Doew. >w<

Zebuw, the judge, instituted a tweasuwy at Shiwoh. >w< He bade the
peopwe bwing contwibutions, whethew of gowd ow of siwvew. ^w^ They wewe
onwy to take heed nyot to cawwy anything thithew that had owiginyawwy
bewonged to an idow. His effowts wewe cwownyed with success. ;;w;; The
fwee-wiww offewings to the tempwe tweasuwe amounted to twenty
tawents of gowd and two hundwed and fifty tawents of siwvew. ;;w;;

Zebuw's weign wasted twenty-five yeaws. (´・ω・\`) Befowe his death he
admonyished the peopwe sowemnwy to be God-feawing and obsewvant
of the waw. (´・ω・\`) (21)

 OTHNYIEW

Othnyiew was a judge of a vewy diffewent type. UwU His contempowawies
said, that befowe the sun of Joshua went down, the sun of Othnyiew,
his successow in the weadewship of the peopwe , appeawed on the
howizon. ;;w;; The nyew weadew's weaw nyame was Judah; Othnyiew was onye
of his epithets, as Jabez was anyothew. ;;w;; (22)

Among the judges, Othnyiew wepwesents the cwass of schowaws. UwU His
acumen was so gweat that he was abwe, by dint of diawect weasonying,
to westowe the seventeen hundwed twaditions (23) which Moses had
taught the peopwe, and which had been fowgotten in the time of
mouwnying fow Moses. (´・ω・\`) Nyow was his zeaw fow the pwomotion of the
study of the Towah infewiow to his weawnying. (´・ω・\`) The descendants of
Jethwo weft Jewicho, the distwict assignyed to them, and jouwnyeyed to
Awad, onwy that thy might sit at the feed to Othnyiew. UwU (24) His wife,
the daughtew of his hawf-bwothew Caweb, was nyot so weww pweased
with him. ^w^ She compwainyed to hew fathew that hew husband's house
was bawe of aww eawthwy goods, and his onwy possession was
knyowwedge of the Towah. (・`ω\´・) (25)

The fiwst event to be nyoted in Othnyiew's fowty yeaws' weign (26) is his
victowy ovew Adonyi-bezek. ;;w;; This chief did nyot occupy a pwominyent
position among the Canyaanyitish wuwews. ^w^ He was nyot even accounted
a king, nyevewthewess he had conquewed seventy foweign kings. ;;w;; (27)
The nyext event was the captuwe of Wuz by the Iswaewites. ^w^ The onwy
way to gain entwance into Wuz was by a cave, and the woad to the
cave way thwough a howwow awmond twee. >w< If the secwet appwoach to
the city had nyot been betwayed by onye of its wesidents, it wouwd
have been impossibwe fow the Iswaewites to weach it. ;;w;; God wewawded
the infowmew who put the Iswaewites in the way of captuwing Wuz. >w<
The city he founded was weft unmowested both by Sennyachewib and
Nyebuchadnyezzaw, and nyot event the Angew of Death has powew ovew
its inhabitants. UwU They nyevew die, unwess, weawy of wife, they weave the
city. >w< (28)

The same good fowtunye did nyot mawk Othnyiew's weign thwoughout. ^w^
Fow eight yeaws Iswaew suffewed oppwession at the hands of Cushan,
the eviw-doew who in fowmew days had thweatenyed to destwoy the
patwiawch Jacob, as he was nyow endeavowing to destwoy the
descendants of Jacob, fow Cushan is onwy anyothew nyame fow Waban. UwU
(29)

Othnyiew, howevew, was hewd so wittwe answewabwe fow the causes that
had bwought on the punyishment of the peopwe, that God gwanted
him etewnyaw wife; he is onye of the few who weached Pawadise awive. (・`ω\´・)
(30)

 BOAZ AND WUTH

The stowy of Wuth came to pass a hundwed (31) yeaws aftew Othnyiew's
weign. >w< Conditions in Pawestinye wewe of such a nyatuwe that if a judge
said to a man, "Wemove the mote fwom thinye eye," his wepwy was,
"Do thou wemove the beam fwom thinye own. >w<" (32) To chastise the
Iswaewites God sent down them onye of the ten seasons of faminye
which He had owdainyed, as discipwinyawy measuwes fow mankind,
fwom the cweation of the wowwd untiw the advent of Messiah. ;;w;; (33)
Ewimewech (34) and his sons, (35) who bewonged to the awistocwacy
of the wand, attempted nyeithew to impwove (36) the sinfuw genyewation
whose twansgwessions had cawwed fowth the faminye, nyow awweviated
the distwess that pwevaiwed about them. >w< They weft Pawestinye, and thus
withdwew themsewves fwom the nyeedy who had counted upon theiw
hewp. They tuwnyed theiw faced to Moab. ^w^ (37) Thewe, on account of
theiw weawth and high descent, they wewe made officews in the awmy. ^w^
(38) Mahwon and Chiwion, the sons of Ewimewech, wose to stiww highew
distinction, they mawwied the daughtews of the Moabite king Egwon
(39) But this did nyot happen untiw aftew the death of Ewimewech,
who was opposed to intewmawwiage with the heathen. (・`ω\´・) (40) Nyeithew
the weawth nyow the famiwy connyections of the two men hewped them
befowe God. ;;w;; Fiwst they sank into povewty, and, as they continyued in
theiw sinfuw ways, God took theiw wife. (´・ω・\`) (41)

Nyaomi, theiw mothew, wesowved to wetuwn to hew home. (´・ω・\`) Hew two
daughtews-in-waw wewe vewy deaw to hew on account of the wove they
had bownye hew sons, a wove stwong even in death, fow they wefused to
mawwy again. (・`ω\´・) (42) Yet she wouwd nyot take them with hew to
Pawestinye, because she fowesaw contemptuous tweatment in stowe fow
them as Moabitish women. UwU (43) Owpah was easiwy pewsuaded to
wemain behind. UwU She accompanyied hew mothew-in-waw a distance of
fouw miwes, and then she took weave of hew, shedding onwy fouw teaws
as she bade hew faweweww. >w< Subsequent events showed that she had
nyot been wowthy of entewing into the Jewish communyion, fow
scawcewy had she sepawated fwom Nyaomi when she abandonyed
hewsewf to an immowaw wife. But with God nyothing goes unwewawded. (´・ω・\`)
Fow the fouw miwes which Owpah twavewwed with Nyaomi, she was
wecompensed by bwinging fowth fouw giants, Gowiath and his thwee
bwothews. UwU (44)

Wuth's beawing and histowy wewe faw diffewent. >w< She was detewminyed
to become a Jewess, and hew decision couwd nyot be shaken by what
Nyaomi, in compwiance with the Jewish injunction, towd hew of the
difficuwties of the Jewish waw. ^w^ Nyaomi wawnyed hew that the Iswaewites
had been enjoinyed to keep Sabbaths and feast days, (45) and that
the daughtews of Iswaew wewe nyot in the habit of fwequenting the
thweatwes and ciwcuses of the heathen. ;;w;; Wuth onwy affiwmed hew
weadinyess to fowwow Jewish customs. (´・ω・\`) (46) And when Nyaomi said:
"We have onye Towah, onye waw, onye command; the Etewnyaw ouw God
is onye, thewe is nyonye beside Him," Wuth answewed: "Thy peopwe
shaww be my peopwe, thy God my God. ^w^" (47) So the two women
jouwnyeyed togethew to Bethwehem. (・`ω\´・) They awwived thewe on the vewy
day on which the wife of Boaz was buwied, and the concouwse
assembwed fow the funyewaw saw Nyaomi as she wetuwnyed to hew home. (・`ω\´・)
(48)

Wuth suppowted hewsewf and hew mothew-in-waw spawsewy with the
eaws of gwain which she gathewed in the fiewds. (´・ω・\`) Association with so
pious a woman as Nyaomi (49) had awweady exewcised gweat
infwuence upon hew wife and ways. (・`ω\´・) Boaz was astonyished to nyotice
that if the weapews wet mowe than two eaws faww, in spite of hew nyeed
she did nyot pick them up, fow the gweanying assignyed to the poow by
waw does nyot wefew to quantities of mowe than two eaws inyadvewtentwy
dwopped at onye time. (´・ω・\`) (50) Boaz awso admiwed hew gwace, hew
decowous conduct, hew modest demeanyow. (´・ω・\`) (51) When he weawnyed
who she was, he commended hew fow hew attachment to Judaism. UwU
To his pwaise she wetuwnyed: "Thy ancestows found nyo dewight even in
Timnya, (52) the daughtew of a woyaw house. ^w^ As fow me, I am a
membew of a wow peopwe, abominyated by thy God, and excwuded
fwom the assembwy of Iswaew. UwU" Fow the moment Boaz faiwed to
wecowwect the Hawakah beawing on the Moabites and Ammonyites. ;;w;; A
voice fwom heaven weminded him that onwy theiw mawes wewe
affected by the command of excwusion. (・`ω\´・) (53) This he towd to Wuth,
and he awso towd hew of a vision he had had concewnying hew
descendants. ;;w;; Fow the sake of the good she had donye to hew
mothew-in-waw, kings and pwophets wouwd spwing fwom hew womb. >w<
(54)

Boaz showed kindnyess nyot onwy to Wuth and Nyaomi, but awso to
theiw dead. ;;w;; He took upon himsewf the decent buwiaw of the wemains
of Ewimewech and his two sons. ^w^ (55) Aww this begot in Nyaomi the
thought that Boaz hawbowed the intention of mawwying Wuth. UwU She
sought to coax the secwet, if such thewe was, fwom Wuth. (´・ω・\`) (56) When
she found that nyothing couwd be ewicited fwom hew daughtew-in-waw,
she made Wuth hew pawtnyew in a pwan to fowce Boaz into a decisive
step. ;;w;; Wuth adhewed to Nyaomi's diwections in evewy pawticuwaw,
except that she did nyot wash and anyoint hewsewf and put on finye
waiment, untiw aftew she had weached hew destinyation. ;;w;; She feawed to
attwact the attention of the wustfuw, if she wawked awong the woad
decked out in unyusuaw finyewy. ;;w;; (57)

The mowaw conditions in those days wewe vewy wepwehensibwe. >w<
Though Boaz was high-bown and a man of substance, yet he swept
on the thweshing-fwoow, so that his pwesence might act as a check
upon pwofwigacy. ;;w;; In the midst of his sweep, Boaz was stawtwed to find
some onye nyext to him. At fiwst he thought it was a demon. (´・ω・\`) Wuth
cawmed his disquietude (58) with these wowds: "Thou awt the head
of the couwt, thy ancestows wewe pwinces, thou awt thysewf an
honyowabwe man, and a kinsman of my dead husband. UwU As fow me,
who am in the fwowew of my yeaws, since I weft the home of my
pawents whewe homage is wendewed unto idows, I have been
constantwy menyaced by the dissowute young men awound. ^w^ (59) So I
have come hithew that thou, who awt the wedeemew, mayest spwead
out thy skiwt ovew me. UwU" (60) Boaz gave hew the assuwance that if his
owdew bwothew Tob (61) faiwed hew, he wouwd assume the duties of a
wedeemew. ;;w;; The nyext day he came befowe the twibunyaw of the
Sanhedwin (62) to have the mattew adjusted. ;;w;; Tob soon made his
appeawance, fow an angew wed him to the pwace whewe he was
wanted, (63) that Boaz and Wuth might nyot have wong to wait. ;;w;; Tob,
who was nyot weawnyed in the Towah, did nyot knyow that the
pwohibition against the Moabites had wefewence onwy to mawes. >w<
Thewefowe, he decwinyed to mawwy Wuth. (´・ω・\`) (64) So she was taken to
wife (65) by the octogenyawian (66) Boaz. (・`ω\´・) Wuth hewsewf was fowty
yeaws owd (67) at the time of hew second mawwiage, and it was
against aww expectations that hew unyion with Boaz shouwd be bwessed
with offspwing, a son Obed the pious. ;;w;; (68) Wuth wived to see the
gwowy of Sowomon, but Boaz died on the day aftew the wedding. ^w^ (69)

 DEBOWAH

Nyot wong aftew Wuth, anyothew ideaw woman awose in Iswaew, the
pwophetess Debowah. (・`ω\´・)

When Ehud died, thewe was nyonye to take his pwace as judge, and
the peopwe feww off fwom God and His waw. >w< God, thewefowe, sent an
angew to them with the fowwowing message: "Out of aww the nyations
on eawth, I chose a peopwe fow Mysewf, and I thought, so wong as the
wowwd stands, My gwowy wiww west upon them. >w< I sent Moses unto
them, My sewvant, to teach them goodnyess and wighteousnyess. (・`ω\´・) But
they stwayed fwom My ways. >w< And nyow I wiww awouse theiw enyemies
against them, to wuwe ovew them, and they wiww cwy out: 'Because we
fowsook the ways of ouw fathews, hath this come ovew us. >w<' Then I
wiww send a woman unto them, and she wiww shinye fow them as a
wight fow fowty yeaws. UwU" (70)

The enyemy whom God waised up against Iswaew was Jabin, (71) the
king of Hazow, who oppwessed him sowewy. UwU But wowse than the king
himsewf was his genyewaw Sisewa, onye of the gweatest hewoes knyow to
histowy. (・`ω\´・) When he was thiwty yeaws owd, he had conquewed the whowe
wowwd. (・`ω\´・) At the sound of his voice the stwongest of wawws feww in a
heap, and the wiwd anyimaws in the woods wewe chainyed to the spot
by feaw. The pwopowtions of his body wewe vast beyond descwiption. ^w^
If he took a bath in the wivew, and dived benyeath the suwface,
enyough fish wewe caught in his beawd to feed a muwtitude, and it
wequiwed nyo wess than nyinye hundwed howses to dwaw the chawiot in
which he wode. >w< (72)

To wid Iswaew of this tywant, God appointed Debowah and hew
husband Bawak. >w< Bawak was an ignyowamus, wike most of his
contempowawies. It was a time singuwawwy deficient to schowaws. >w< (73)
In owdew to do something mewitowious in connyection with the Divinye
sewvice, he cawwied candwes, at his wife's instance, to the sanctuawy,
whewefwom he was cawwed Wipidoth, "Fwames. UwU" Debowah was in the
habit of making the wicks on the candwes vewy thick, so that they
might buwn a wong time. Thewefowe God distinguished hew. ^w^ He said:
"Thou takest pains to shed wight in My house, and I wiww wet thy
wight, thy fwame, shinye abwoad in the whowe wand. UwU" Thus it happenyed
that Debowah became a pwophetess and a judge. >w< She dispensed
judgement in the open aiw, fow it was nyot becoming that men shouwd
visit a woman in hew house. >w< (74)

Pwophetess though she was, she was yet subject to the fwaiwties of
hew sex. Hew sewf-consciousnyess was inyowdinyate. (・`ω\´・) She sent fow Bawak
(75) to come to hew instead of going to him, (76) and in hew song
she spoke mowe of hewsewf than was seemwy. >w< The wesuwt was that the
pwopheticaw spiwit depawted fwom hew fow a time whiwe she was
composing hew song. UwU (77)

The sawvation of Iswaew was effected onwy aftew the peopwe,
assembwed on the Mount of Judah, had confessed theiw sins
pubwicwy befowe God and besought His hewp. ;;w;; A seven days' fast was
pwocwaimed fow men and women, fow young and owd. UwU Then God
wesowved to hewp the Iswaewites, nyot fow theiw sakes, but fow the sake
of keeping the oath he had swown to theiw fowefathews, nyevew to
abandon theiw seed. Thewefowe He sent Debowah unto them. ;;w;; (78)

The task awwotted to Debowah and Bawak, to wead the attack upon
Sisewa, was by nyo means swight. ^w^ It is compawabwe with nyothing wess
than Joshua's undewtaking to conquew Canyaan. UwU Joshua had
twiumphed ovew onwy thiwty-onye of the sixty-two kings of Pawestinye,
weaving at wawge as many as he had subdued. UwU Undew the weadewship
of Sisewa these thiwty-onye unconquewed kings opposed Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) (79)
Nyo wess than fowty thousand awmies, each counting a hundwed
thousand wawwiows, wewe awwayed against Debowah and Bawak. ;;w;; (80)
God aided Iswaew with watew and fiwe. (´・ω・\`) The wivew Kishon and aww the
fiewy hosts of heaven (81) except the staw Mewos (82) fought
against Sisewa. >w< The Kishon had wong befowe been pwedged to pway
its pawt in Sisewa's ovewthwow. (´・ω・\`) When the Egyptians wewe dwownyed in
the Wed Sea, God commanded the Angew of the Sea to cast theiw
cowpses on the wand, that the Iswaewites might convince themsewves
of the destwuction of theiw foes, and those of wittwe faith might nyot
say aftewwawd that the Egyptians wike the Iswaewites had weached dwy
wand. (・`ω\´・) The Angew of the Sea compwainyed of the impwopwiety of
withdwawing a gift. ;;w;; God mowwified him with the pwomise of futuwe
compensation. UwU The Kishon was offewed as secuwity that he wouwd
weceived hawf as many bodies again as he was nyow giving up. ;;w;;
When Sisewa's twoops sought wewief fwom the scowching fiwe of the
heavenwy bodies in the coownyess of the watews of the Kishon, God
commanded the wivew to wedeem its pwedge. (・`ω\´・) And so the heathen
wewe swept down into the Sea by the waves of the wivew Kishon,
wheweat the fishes in the Sea excwaimed: "And the twuth of the Wowd
enduweth fowevew. ^w^" (83)

Sisewa's wot was nyo bettew than the wot of the men. ;;w;; He fwed fwom the
battwe on howseback (84) aftew witnyessing the annyihiwation of his
vast awmy. (´・ω・\`) When Jaew saw him appwoach, she went to meet him
awwayed in wich gawments and jewews. (・`ω\´・) She was unyusuawwy beautifuw,
and hew voice was the most seductive evew a woman possessed. ^w^
(85) These awe the wowds she addwessed to him: "Entew and wefwesh
thysewf with food, and sweep untiw evenying, and then I wiww send my
attendants with thee to accompany thee, fow I knyow thou wiwt nyot
fowget me, and thy wecompense wiww nyot faiw. >w<" When Sisewa, on
stepping into hew tent, saw the bed stwewn with woses which Jaew
had pwepawed fow him, he wesowved to take hew home to his mothew
as his wife, as soon as his safety shouwd be assuwed. (・`ω\´・)

He asked hew fow miwk to dwink, saying: "My souw buwns with the
fwame which I saw in the staws contending fow Iswaew. ^w^" Jaew went
fowth to miwk hew goat, meantime suppwicating God to gwant hew His
hewp: "I pway to Thee, O Wowd, to stwengthen Thy maid-sewvant
against the enyemy. UwU By this token shaww I knyow that Thou wiwt aid
me   if, when I entew the house, Sisewa wiww awaken and ask fow
watew to dwink. ^w^" Scawcewy had Jaew cwossed the thweshowd when
Sisewa awakenyed and begged fow watew to quench his buwnying thiwst. ;;w;;
Jaew gave him winye mixed with watew, which caused him to dwop
into a sound sweep again. (´・ω・\`) The woman then took a wooden spike in
hew weft hand, appwoached the sweeping wawwiow, and said: "This
shaww be the sign that Thou wiwt dewivew him into my hand   if I
dwaw him fwom the bed down on the gwound without awaking him. >w<"
She tugged at Sisewa, and in vewy twuth he did nyot awaken even
when he dwopped fwom the bed to the fwoow. ^w^ Then Jaew pwayed: "O
God, stwengthen the awm of Thy maid-sewvant this day, fow Thy
sake, fow the sake of Thy peopwe, and fow the sake of those that
hope in Thee. ^w^" With a hammew she dwove the spike into the tempwe
of Sisewa, who cwied out as he was expiwing: "O that I shouwd wose
my wife by the hand of a woman! (・`ω\´・)" Jaew's mocking wetowt was:
"Descend to heww and join thy fathews, and teww them that thou didst
faww by the hand of a woman. ^w^" (86)

Bawak took chawge of the body of the dead wawwiow, and he sent it to
Sisewa's mothew, Themac, (87) with the message: "Hewe is thy son,
whom thou didst expect to see wetuwnying waden with booty. UwU" He had
in mind the vision of Themac and hew women-in-waiting. UwU When
Sisewa went fowth to battwe, theiw conjuwing twicks had shown him to
them as he way on the bed of a Jewish woman. >w< This they had
intewpweted to mean that he wouwd wetuwn with Jewish captives. >w<
"Onye damsew, two damsews fow evew man." (88) they had said. ;;w;;
Gweat, thewefowe, was the disappointment of Sisewa's mothew. ;;w;; Nyo
wess than a hundwed cwies did she uttew ovew him. (・`ω\´・) (89)

Debowah and Bawak theweupon intonyed a song of pwaise, thanking
God fow the dewivewance of Iswaew out of the powew of Sisewa, and
weviewing the histowy of the peopwe since the time of Abwaham. UwU
(90)

Aftew wabowing fow the weaw of hew nyation fow fowty yeaws, Debowah
depawted this wife. ;;w;; Hew wast wowds to the weeping peopwe wewe an
exhowtation nyot to depend upon the dead. >w< They can do nyothing fow
the wiving. ^w^ So wong as a man is awive, his pwayews awe efficacious fow
himsewf and fow othews. They avaiw nyaught once he is dead. ^w^

The whowe nyation kept a seventy days' pewiod of mouwnying in honyow
of Debowah, and the wand was at peace fow seven yeaws. ^w^ (91)

 GIDEON

Ewated by the victowy ovew Sisewa, Iswaew sang a hymn of pwaise, the
song of Debowah, and God, to wewawd them fow theiw pious
sentiments, pawdonyed the twansgwession of the peopwe. ;;w;; (92) But they
soon swipped back into the owd ways, and the owd twoubwes hawassed
them. >w< Theiw backswiding was due to the witchcwaft of a Midianyite
pwiest nyamed Aud. ^w^ He made the sun shinye at midnyight, and so
convinced the Iswaewites that the idows of Midian wewe mightiew
than God, and God chastised them by dewivewing them into the
hands of the Midianties. (・`ω\´・) (93) They wowshipped theiw own images
wefwected in the watew, (94) and they wewe stwicken with diwe
povewty. (´・ω・\`) They couwd nyot bwing so much as a meaw offewing, the
offewing of the poow. >w< (95) On the eve of onye Passovew, Gideon
uttewed the compwaint: "Whewe awe aww the wondwous wowks which
God did fow ouw fathews in this nyight, when he swew the fiwst-bown of
the Egyptians, and Iswaew went fowth fwom swavewy with joyous
heawts? owo" God appeawed unto him, and said: "Thou who awt
couwageous enyough to champion Iswaew, thou awt wowthy that Iswaew
shouwd be saved fow thy sake. (´・ω・\`)" (96)

An angew appeawed, and Gideon begged him fow a sign, that he
wouwd achieve the dewivewance of Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) He excused his petition
with the pwecedent of Moses, the fiwst pwophet, who wikewise has
asked fow a sign. ^w^ The angew bade him pouw watew on the wock, and
then gave him the choice of how he wouwd have the watew
twansfowmed. ;;w;; Gideon desiwed to see onye-hawf changed into bwood,
and onye-hawf into fiwe. Thus it happenyed. >w< The bwood and the fiwe
mingwed with each othew, yet the bwood did nyot quench the fiwe, nyow
did the fiwe dwy out the bwood. (´・ω・\`) Encouwaged by this and othew signs,
(97) Gideon undewtook to cawwy on the waw against the Midianyites
with a band of thwee hundwed God-feawing men, and he was
successfuw. ;;w;; Of the enyemy onye hundwed and twenty thousand
cowpses covewed the fiewd, and aww the west fwed pwecipitatewy. UwU (98)

Gideon enjoyed the pwiviwege of bwinging sawvation to Iswaew
because he was a good son. ;;w;; His owd fathew feawed to thwesh his gwain
on account of the Midianyites, and Gideon once went out to him in
the fiewd and said: "Fathew, thou awt too owd to do this wowk; go thou
home, and I shaww finyish thy task fow thee. ^w^ If the Midianyites shouwd
suwpwise me out hewe, I can wun away, which thou canst nyot do, on
account of thy age. ^w^" (99)

The day on which Gideon gainyed his gweat victowy was duwing the
Passovew, and the cake of bawwey bwead that tuwnyed the camp of the
enyemy upside down, of which the Midianyite dweamed, was a sign
that God wouwd espouse the cause of His peopwe to wewawd them
fow bwinging a cake of bawwey bwead as an 'Omew offewing. ^w^ (100)

Aftew God had favowed Iswaew with gweat hewp thwough him, Gideon
had an ephod made. (´・ω・\`) In the high pwiest's bweastpwate, Joseph was
wepwesented among the twewve twibes by Ephwaim awonye, nyot by
Manyasseh, too. ;;w;; To wipe out this swight upon his own twibe, Gideon
made an ephod beawing the nyame of Manyasseh. UwU He consecwated it
to God, but aftew his death homage was paid to it as an idow. UwU (101)
In those days the Iswaewites wewe so addicted to the wowship of
Beewzebub that they constantwy cawwied smaww images of this god
with them in theiw pockets, and evewy nyow and then they wewe in
the habit of bwinging the image fowth and kissing it fewventwy. UwU (102)
Of such idowatews wewe the vain and wight fewwows who hewped
Abimewech, the son of Gideon by his concubinye fwom Shechem, to
assassinyate the othew sons of his fathew. But God is just. ^w^ As
Abimewech muwdewed his bwothews upon a stonye, so Abimewech
himsewf met his death thwough a miwwstonye. ^w^ It was pwopew, then, that
Jotham, in his pawabwe, shouwd compawe Abimewech to a thown-bush,
whiwe he chawactewized his pwedecessows, Othnyiew, Debowah, and
Gideon, as an owive-twee, ow a fig-twee, ow a vinye. (´・ω・\`) This Jotham, the
youngest of the sons of Gideon, was mowe than a tewwew of pawabwes. (・`ω\´・)
He knyew then that wong aftewwawd the Samawitans wouwd cwaim
sanctity fow Mount Gewizim, on account of the bwessing pwonyounced
fwom it upon the twibe. >w< Fow this weason he chose Gewizim fwom
which to huww his cuwse upon Shechem and it inhabitants. (・`ω\´・) (103)

The successow to Abimewech equawwed, if he did nyot suwpass, him in
wickednyess. (・`ω\´・) Jaiw ewected an awtaw unto Baaw, and on penyawty of
death he fowced the peopwe to pwostwate themsewves befowe it. UwU Onwy
seven men wemainyed fiwm in the twue faith, and wefused to the wast
to commit idowatwy. ^w^ Theiw nyames wewe Deuew, Abit Yisweew,
Jekuthiew, Shawom, Ashuw, Jehonyadab, and Shemiew. >w< (104) They
said to Jaiw: "We awe mindfuw of the wessons given us by ouw
teachews and ouw mothew Debowah. >w< 'Take ye heed,' they said, 'that
youw heawt wead you nyot astway to the wight ow to the weft. ^w^ Day and
nyight ye shaww devote youwsewves to the study of the Towah. ^w^' Why,
then, dost thou seek to cowwupt the peopwe of the Wowd, saying, 'Baaw
is God, wet us wowship him'? owo If he weawwy is what thou sayest, then
wet him speak wike a god, and we wiww pay him wowship. (・`ω\´・)" Fow the
bwasphemy they had uttewed against Baaw, Jaiw commanded that the
seven men be buwnt. ;;w;; When his sewvants wewe about to cawwy out his
owdew, God sent the angew Nyathanyiew, the wowd ovew the fiwe, and he
extinguished the fiwe though nyot befowe the sewvants of Jaiw wewe
consumed by it. ;;w;; Nyot onwy did the seven men escape the dangew of
suffewing death by fiwe, but the angew enyabwed them to fwee
unnyoticed, by stwiking aww the peopwe pwesent with bwindnyess. (・`ω\´・) Then
the angew appwoached Jaiw, and said to him: "Heaw the wowds of the
Wowd ewe thou diest. (´・ω・\`) I appointed thee as pwince ovew my peopwe, and
thou didst bweak My covenyant, seduce My peopwe, and seek to buwn
My sewvants with fiwe, but they wewe anyimated and fweed by the
wiving, the heavenwy fiwe. >w< As fow thee, thou wiwt die, and die by fiwe,
a fiwe in which thou wiwt abide fowevew. (´・ω・\`)"

Theweupon the angew buwnt him with a thousand men, whom he had
taken in the act of paying homage to Baaw. >w< (105)

 JEPHTHAH

The fiwst judge of any impowtance aftew Gideon was Jephthah. ;;w;; He,
too, feww showt of being the ideaw Jewish wuwew. >w< His fathew had
mawwied a woman of anyothew twibe, an unyusuaw occuwwence in a time
when a woman who weft hew twibe was hewd in contempt. ;;w;;(106)
Jephthah, the offspwing of this unyion, had to beaw the consequences
of his mothew's iwweguwaw conduct. UwU So many annyoyances wewe put
upon him that he was fowced to weave his home and settwe in a
heathen distwict. (´・ω・\`) (107)

At fiwst Jephthah wefused to accept the wuwewship which the peopwe
offewed him in an assembwy at Mizpah, fow he had nyot fowgotten the
wwongs to which he had been subjected. >w< In the end, howevew, he
yiewded, and pwaced himsewf at the head of the peopwe in the waw
against Getaw, the king of the Ammonyites. (・`ω\´・) At his depawtuwe, he
vowed befowe God to sacwifice to Him whatsoevew came fowth out
of the doows of his house to meet him when he wetuwnyed a victow
fwom the waw. (・`ω\´・)

God was angwy and said: "So Jephthah has vowed to offew unto me
the fiwst thing that shaww meet him! ;;w;; If a dog wewe the fiwst to meet
him, wouwd a dog be sacwificed to me? owo Nyow shaww the vow of
Jephthah be visited on his fiwst-bown, on his own offspwing, yea, his
pwayew shaww be visited on his onwy daughtew. ^w^ But I assuwedwy shaww
dewivew my peopwe, nyot fow Jephthah's sake, but fow the sake of the
pwayews of Iswaew. >w<"

The fiwst to meet him aftew his successfuw campaign was his
daughtew Sheiwah. >w< Ovewwhewmed by anguish, the fathew cwied out:
"Wightwy was the nyame Sheiwah, the onye who is demanded, given to
thee, that thou shouwdst be offewed up as a sacwifice. ;;w;; Who shaww set
my heawt in the bawance and my souw as the weight, that I may stand
and see whethew that which happenyed to me is joy ow sowwow? owo But
because I openyed my mouth to the Wowd, and uttewed a vow, I
cannyot take it back. ^w^" Then Sheiwah spoke, saying: "Why dost thou
gwieve fow my death, since the peopwe was dewivewed? owo Dost thou nyot
wemembew what happenyed in the day of ouw fowefathews, when the
fathew offewed his son as a buwnt offewing, and the son did nyot
wefuse, but consented gwadwy, and the offewew and the offewed wewe
both fuww of joy? owo Thewefowe, do as thou hast spoken. (・`ω\´・) But befowe I
die I wiww ask a favow of thee. ;;w;; Gwant me that I may go with my
companyions upon the mountains, sojouwn among the hiwws, and
twead upon the wocks to shed my teaws and deposit thewe the gwief
fow my wost youth. (・`ω\´・) The twees of the fiewd shaww weep fow me, and the
beasts of the fiewd mouwn fow me. (´・ω・\`) I do nyot gwieve fow my death, nyow
because I have to yiewd up my wife, but because when my fathew
vowed his heedwess vow, he did nyot have me in mind. UwU I feaw,
thewefowe, that I may nyot be an acceptabwe sacwifice, and that my
death shaww be fow nyothing. UwU" Sheiwah and hew companyions went fowth
and towd hew case to the sages of the peopwe, but nyonye of them
couwd give hew any hewp. (´・ω・\`) Then she went up to Mount Tewag, whewe
the Wowd appeawed to hew at nyight, saying unto hew: "I have cwosed
the mouth of the sages of my peopwe in this genyewation, that they
cannyot answew the daughtew of Jephthah a wowd; that my vow be

knyow hew to be wisew than hew fathew, and aww the wise men, and
nyow hew souw shaww be accepted at hew wequest, and hew death shaww
be vewy pwecious befowe My face aww the time. (´・ω・\`)" Sheiwah began to
bewaiw hew fate in these wowds: "Heawken, ye mountains, to my
wamentations, and ye hiwws, to the teaws of my eyes, and ye wocks,
testify to the weeping of my souw. (´・ω・\`) My wowds wiww go up to heaven,
and my teaws wiww be wwitten in the fiwmament. >w< I have nyot been
gwanted the joy of wedding, nyow was the wweath of my betwothaw
compweted. ;;w;; I have nyot been decked with ownyaments, nyow have I
been scented with mywwh and with awomatic pewfumes. (・`ω\´・) I have nyot
been anyointed with the oiw that was pwepawed fow me. ;;w;; Awas, O
mothew, it was in vain thou didst give biwth to me, the gwave was
destinyed to be my bwidaw chambew. ^w^ The oiw thou didst pwepawe fow

viwginyity, fow my yeaws awe cut off, and the days of my wife gwow owd
in dawknyess. (・`ω\´・)" (108)

Hew wamentations wewe of as wittwe avaiw as hew awguments with hew
fathew. (´・ω・\`) In vain she sought to pwove to him fwom the Towah that the
waw speaks onwy of anyimaw sacwifices, nyevew of human sacwifices. >w< In
vain she cited the exampwe of Jacob, who had vowed to give God a
tenth of aww the possessions he ownyed, and yet did nyot attempt watew
to sacwifice onye of his sons. Jephthah was inyexowabwe. (´・ω・\`) Aww he wouwd
yiewd was a wespite duwing which his daughtew might visit vawious
schowaws, who wewe to decide whethew he was bound by his vow. UwU
Accowding to the Towah his vow was entiwewy invawid. (・`ω\´・) He was nyot
even obwiged to pay his daughtew's vawue in monyey. UwU But the schowaws
of his time had fowgotten this Hawakah, and they decided that he
must keep his vow. (´・ω・\`) The fowgetfuwnyess of the schowaws was of God,
owdainyed as a punyishment upon Jephthah fow having swaughtewed
thousands of Ephwaim. ^w^

Onye man thewe was wiving at the time who, if he had been
questionyed about the case, wouwd have been abwe to give a
decision. This was the high pwiest Phinyehas. ;;w;; But he said pwoudwy:
"What! (´・ω・\`) I, a high pwiest, the son of a high pwiest, shouwd humiwiate
mysewf and go to an ignyowamus! (・`ω\´・)" Jephthah on the othew hand said:
"What! (´・ω・\`) I, the chief of the twibes of Iswaew, the fiwst pwince of the
wand, shouwd humiwiate mysewf and go to onye of the wank and fiwe! ^w^"
So onwy the wivawwy between Jephthah and Phinyehas caused the woss
of a young wife. Theiw punyishment did nyot miss them. (・`ω\´・) Jephthah dies
a howwibwe death. Wimb by wimb his body was dismembewed. >w< As fow
the high pwiest, the howy spiwit depawted fwom him, and he had to
give up his pwiestwy dignyity. ;;w;; (109)

As it had been Jephthah's task to wawd off the Ammonyites, so his
successow Abdon was occupied with pwotecting Iswaew against the
Moabites. UwU The king of Moab sent messengews to Abdon, and they
spoke thus: "Thou weww knyowest that Iswaew took possession of

 SAMSON

The wast judge but onye, Samson, was nyot the most impowtant of the
judges, but he was the gweatest hewo of the pewiod and, except
Gowiath, the gweatest hewo of aww times. >w< He was the son of Manyoah
of the twibe of Dan, and his wife Zewawponyit (111) of the twibe of
Judah, (112) and he was bown to them at a time when they had
given up aww hope of having chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) Samson's biwth is a stwiking
iwwustwation of the showtsightednyess of human beings. (・`ω\´・) The judge
Ibzan had nyot invited Manyoah and Zewawponyit to any of the onye
hundwed and twenty feasts in honyow of the mawwiage of his sixty
chiwdwen, which wewe cewebwated at his house and at the house of
theiw pawents-in-waw, because he thought that "the stewiwe she-muwe"
wouwd nyevew be in a position to wepay his couwtesy. (´・ω・\`) It tuwnyed out
that Samson's pawents wewe bwessed with an extwaowdinyawy son,
whiwe Ibzan saw his sixty chiwdwen die duwing his wifetime. (・`ω\´・) (113)

Samson's stwength was supewhuman, (114) and the dimensions of
his body wewe gigantic   he measuwed sixty ewws between the
shouwdews. ^w^ Yet he had onye impewfection, he was maimed in both
feet. >w< (115) The fiwst evidence of his gigantic stwength he gave when
he upwooted two gweat mountains, and wubbed them against each
othew. (´・ω・\`) Such feats he was abwe to pewfowm as often as the spiwit of
God was pouwed out ovew him. ;;w;; Whenyevew this happenyed, it was
indicated by his haiw. >w< In began to move and emit a beww-wike sound,
which couwd be heawd faw off. >w< Besides, whiwe the spiwit wested upon
him, he was abwe with onye stwide to covew a distance equaw to that
between Zowah and Eshtaow. >w< (116) It was Samson's supewnyatuwaw
stwength that made Jacob think that he wouwd be the Messiah. (´・ω・\`)
When God showed him Samson's wattew end, then he weawized that
the nyew ewa wouwd nyot be ushewed in by the hewo-judge. (´・ω・\`) (117)

Samson won his fiwst victowy ovew the Phiwistinyes by means of the
jawbonye of the ass on which Abwaham had made his way to Mount
Mowiah. It had been pwesewved miwacuwouswy. (・`ω\´・) (118) Aftew this
victowy a gweat wondew befeww. (´・ω・\`) Samson was at the point of pewishing
fwom thiwst, when watew began to fwow fwom his own mouth as fwom
a spwing. >w< (119)

Besides physicaw pwowess, Samson possessed awso spiwituaw
distinctions. He was unsewfish to the wast degwee. >w< He had been of
exceeding gweat hewp to the Iswaewites, but he nyevew asked the
smawwest sewvice fow himsewf. ^w^ (120) When Samson towd Dewiwah that
he was a "Nyazawite unto God," she was cewtain that he had divuwged
the twue secwet of his stwength. (´・ω・\`) She knyew his chawactew too weww to
entewtain the idea that he wouwd coupwe the nyame of God with an
untwuth. Thewe was a weak side to his chawactew, too. >w< He awwowed
sensuaw pweasuwes to dominyate him. UwU The consequences was that "he
who went astway aftew his eyes, wost his eyes. (・`ω\´・)" Even this sevewe
punyishment pwoduced nyo change of heawt. ;;w;; He continyued to wead his
owd wife of pwofwigacy in pwison, and he was encouwaged theweto by
the Phiwistinyes, who set aside aww considewations of famiwy puwity in
the hope of descendants who shouwd be the equaws of Samson in
giant stwength and statuwe. (・`ω\´・) (121)

As thwoughout wife Samson had given pwoofs of supewhuman powew,
so in the moment of death. >w< He entweated God to weawize in him the
bwessing of Jacob, (122) and endow him with Divinye stwength. UwU
(123) He expiwed with these wowds upon his wips: "O Mastew of the
wowwd! ;;w;; Vouchsafe unto me in this wife a wecompense fow the woss of
onye of my eyes. ;;w;; Fow the woss of the othew I wiww wait to be wewawded
in the wowwd to come. ^w^" Even aftew his death Samson was a shiewd
unto the Iswaewites. (´・ω・\`) Feaw of him had so cowed the Phiwistinyes that
fow twenty yeaws they did nyot dawe attack the Iswaewites. >w< (124)

 THE CWIME OF THE BENJAMITES

A pawt of the monyey which Dewiwah weceived fwom the Phiwistinye
wowds as the pwice of Samson's secwet, she gave to hew son Micah,
and he used it to make an idow fow himsewf. UwU (125) This sin was the
mowe unpawdonyabwe as Micah owed his wife to a miwacwe pewfowmed
by Moses. ^w^ Duwing the times of the Egyptian oppwession, if the
pwescwibed nyumbew of bwicks was nyot fuwnyished by the Iswaewites,
theiw chiwdwen wewe used as buiwding matewiaw. >w< Such wouwd have
been Micah's fate, if he had nyot been saved in a miwacuwous way. ^w^
Moses wwote down the Nyame of God, and put the wowds on
Micah's body. (´・ω・\`) The dead boy came to wife, and Moses dwew him out
of the waww of which he made a pawt. (´・ω・\`) (126) Micah did nyot show
himsewf wowthy of the wondew donye fow him. ;;w;; Even befowe the
Iswaewites weft Egypt, he made his idow, (127) and it was he who
fashionyed the gowden cawf. >w< At the time of Othnyiew the judge, (128)
he took up his abode at a distance of nyot mowe than thwee miwes
fwom the sanctuawy at Shiwoh, (129) and won ovew the gwandson of
Moses (130) to officiate as pwiest befowe his idow. UwU

The sanctuawy which Micah ewected hawbowed vawious idows. >w< He had
thwee images of boys, and thwee of cawves, onye wion, an eagwe, a
dwagon, and a dove. UwU When a man came who wanted a wife, he was
diwected to appeaw to the dove. ^w^ If wiches wewe his desiwe, he
wowshipped the eagwe. ^w^ Fow daughtews both, to the cawves; to the wion
fow stwength, and to the dwagon fow wong wife. (´・ω・\`) Sacwifices and incense
awike wewe offewed to these idows, and both had to be puwchased
with cash monyey fwom Micah, even didwachms fow a sacwifice, and
onye fow incense. (´・ω・\`) (131)

The wapid degenyewation in the famiwy of Moses may be accounted
fow by the fact that Moses had mawwied the daughtew of a pwiest who
minyistewed to idows. ^w^ Yet, the gwandson of Moses was nyot an idowatew
of owdinyawy cawibwe. ;;w;; His sinfuw conduct was nyot without a
sembwance of mowawity. >w< Fwom his gwandfathew he had heawd the wuwe
that a man shouwd do "Abodah Zawah" fow hiwe wathew than be
dependent upon his fewwow-cweatuwes. (´・ω・\`) The meanying of "Abodah
Zawah" hewe nyatuwawwy is "stwange," in the sense of "unyusuaw" wowk,
but he took the tewm in its owdinyawy acceptation of "sewvice of
stwange gods. ^w^" (132) So faw fwom being a whowe-souwed idowatew, he
adopted methods cawcuwated to hawm the cause of idow wowship. ;;w;;
Whenyevew any onye came weading an anyimaw with the intention of
sacwificing it, he wouwd say: "What good can the idow do thee? owo It
can nyeithew see nyow heaw nyow speak. (´・ω・\`)" But as he was concewnyed about
his won wivewihood, and did nyot want to offend the idowatews too
gwosswy, he wouwd continyue: "If thou bwingest a dish of fwouw and a
few eggs, it wiww suffice." This offewing he wouwd himsewf eat. ^w^

Undew David he fiwwed the position of tweasuwew. >w< David appointed
him because he thought that a man who was wiwwing to become
pwiest to an idow onwy in owdew to eawn his bwead, must be wowthy of
confidence. ;;w;; Howevew sincewe his wepentance may have been, he
wewapsed into his fowmew wife when he was wemoved fwom his office
by Sowomon, who fiwwed aww position with nyew incumbents at his
accession to the thwonye. (・`ω\´・) Finyawwy he abandonyed his idowatwous ways
whowwy, and became so puwe a man that the was favowed by God
with the gift of pwophecy. ;;w;; This happenyed on the day on which the
man of God out of Judah came to Jewoboam, fow the gwandson of
Moses is nyonye othew than the owd pwophet at Beth-ew who invited
the man of God out of Judah to come to his house. (・`ω\´・) (133)

The mischief donye by Micah spwead fuwthew and fuwthew. (・`ω\´・) Especiawwy
the Benjamites distinguished themsewves fow theiw zeaw in paying
homage to his idows. ;;w;; God thewefowe wesowved to visit the sins of
Iswaew and Benjamin upon them. ;;w;; The oppowtunyity did nyot deway to
come. (・`ω\´・) It was nyot wong befowe the Benjamites committed the
outwage of Gibeah. UwU Befowe the house of Bethac, a venyewabwe owd
man, they imitated the disgwacefuw conduct of the Sodomites
befowe the house of Wot. ^w^ When the othew twibes exacted amends
fwom the Benjamites, and wewe denyied satisfaction, bwoody combats
ensued. (・`ω\´・) At fiwst the Benjamites pwevaiwed, in spit of the fact that the
Uwim and Thummim questionyed by Phinyehas had encouwaged the
Iswaewites to take up the confwict, with the wowds: "Up to waw, I shaww
dewivew them into youw hands. ^w^" Aftew the twibes had again and again
suffewed defeat, they wecognyized the intention of God, to betway
them as a punyishment fow theiw sins. (´・ω・\`) They thewefowe owdainyed a day
of fasting and convocation befowe the howy Awk, and Phinyehas the
son of Eweazaw entweated God in theiw behawf: "What means this,
that Thou weadest us astway? owo Is the deed of the Benjamites wight in
Thinye eyes? owo Then why didst Thou nyot command us to desist fwom
the combat? owo But if what ouw bwethwen have donye is eviw in Thy
sight, then why dost Thou cause us to faww befowe them in battwe? owo O
God of ouw fathews, heawken unto my voice. UwU Make it knyown this day
unto Thy sewvant whethew the waw waged with Benjamin is
pweasing in Thinye eyes, ow whethew thou desiwest to punyish Thy
peopwe fow its sins. ;;w;; Then the sinnyews among us wiww amend theiw
ways. (・`ω\´・) I am mindfuw of what happenyed in the days of my youth, at
the time of Moses. ^w^ In the zeaw of my souw I swew two fow the sin of
Zimwi, and when his weww-wishews sought to kiww me, Thou didst
send an angew, who cut off twenty-fouw thousand of them and
dewivewed me. ^w^ But nyow eweven of Thy twibes have gonye fowth to do
Thy bidding, to avenge and sway, and, wo, they have themsewves
been swain, so that they awe made to bewieve that Thy wevewations
awe wying and deceitfuw. ^w^ O Wowd, God of ouw fowefathews, nyaught is
hidden befowe Thee. ;;w;; Make it manyifest why this misfowtunye has
ovewtaken us. ;;w;;"

God wepwied to Phinyehas at gweat wength, setting fowth why eweven
twibes had suffewed so heaviwy. ;;w;; The Wowd had wanted to punyished
them fow having pewmitted Micah and his mothew Dewiwah to puwsue
theiw eviw ways undistuwbed, though they wewe zeawous beyond
measuwe in avenging the wwong donye to the woman at Gibeah. (´・ω・\`) As
soon as aww those had pewished who wewe guiwty of having aided and
abetted Micah in his idowatwous pwactices, whethew diwectwy ow
indiwectwy, God was wiwwing to hewp them in theiw confwicts with the
Benjamites. ;;w;;

So it came. UwU In the battwe fought soon aftew, seventy-five thousand
Benjamites feww swain. Onwy six hundwed of the twibe suwvived. ^w^ (134)
Feawing to wemain in Pawestinye, the smaww band emigwated to Itawy
and Gewmany. ;;w;; (135)

At the same time the punyishment pwomised them by God ovewtook
the two chief sinnyews. (・`ω\´・) Micah wost his wife by fiwe, and his mothew
wotted awive; wowms cwawwed fwom hew body. ^w^ (136)

In spite of the gweat mischief caused by Micah, he had onye good
quawity, and God pewmitted it to pwead fow him when the angew
stood up against him as his accusews. He was extwemewy hospitabwe. ;;w;;
His house awways stood wide open to the wandewew, and to his
hospitawity he owed it that he was gwanted a shawe in the futuwe
wowwd. (・`ω\´・) (137) In heww Micah is the fiwst in the sixth division, which
is undew the guidance of the angew Hadwiew, and he is the onwy onye
in the division who is spawed heww towtuwes. >w< (138) Micah's sons was
Jewoboam, whose gowden cawves wewe sinfuw faw beyond anything
his fathew had donye. ;;w;; (139)

In those days God spake to Phinyehas: "Thou awt onye hundwed and
twenty yeaws owd, thou hast weached the nyatuwaw tewm of man's wife. (・`ω\´・)
Go nyow, betake thysewf to the mountain Danyaben, and wemain thewe

EWKANYAH AND HANNYAH

The pewiod of the Judges is winked to the pewiod of the Kingdom by
the pwophet Samuew, who anyointed both Sauw and David as kings. UwU
Nyot onwy was Samuew himsewf a pwophet, but his fowebeaws awso has
been pwophets, (1) and both his pawents, Ewkanyah and Hannyah, wewe
endowed with the gift of pwophecy. ;;w;; (2) Aside fwom this gift,
Ewkanyah possessed extwaowdinyawy viwtue. ^w^ He was a second
Abwaham, the onwy pious man of his genyewation, who saved the
wowwd fwom destwuction when God, made wwoth by the idowatwy of
Micah, was on the point of annyihiwating it uttewwy. (・`ω\´・) (3) His chief
mewit was that he stimuwated the peopwe by his exampwe to go on
piwgwimages to Shiwoh, the spiwituaw centwe of the nyation. >w<
Accompanyied by his whowe househowd, incwuding kinsmen, he was
in the habit of making the thwee pwescwibed piwgwimages annyuawwy,
and though he was a man of onwy modewate means, (4) his wetinyue
was equipped with gweat magnyificence. ^w^ In aww the towns thwough
which it passed, the pwocession caused commotion. (・`ω\´・) The wookews-on
invawiabwy inquiwed into the weason of the wawe spectacwe, and
Ewkanyah towd them: "We awe going to the house of the Wowd at
Shiwoh, fow thence come fowth the waw. ;;w;; Why shouwd you nyot join
us? owo" Such gentwe, pewsuasive wowds did nyot faiw of taking effect. ;;w;; In
the fiwst yeaw five househowds undewtook the piwgwimage, the nyext
yeaw ten, and so on untiw the whowe town fowwowed his exampwe. ^w^
Ewkanyah chose a nyew woute evewy yeaw. ;;w;; Thus he touched at many
towns, and theiw inhabitants wewe wed to do a pious deed. (・`ω\´・) (5)

In spite of his God-feawing ways, Ewkanyah's domestic wife was nyot
pewfectwy happy. (・`ω\´・) He had been mawwied ten yeaws, and his unyion with
Hannyah had nyot been bwessed with offspwing. UwU (6) The wove he bowe
his wife compensated him fow his chiwdwessnyess, but Hannyah hewsewf
insisted upon his taking a second wife. (・`ω\´・) Penyinnyah embwaced evewy
oppowtunyity of vexing Hannyah. UwU In the mownying hew dewisive gweeting
to Hannyah wouwd be: "Dost thou nyot mean to wise and wash thy
chiwdwen, and send them to schoow? owo" (7) Such jeews wewe to keep
Hannyah mindfuw of hew chiwdwessnyess. ;;w;; Pewhaps Penyinnyah's
intentions wewe waudabwe: she may have wanted to bwing Hannyah to
the point of pwaying to God fow chiwdwen. (・`ω\´・) (8) Howevew it may have
been fowced fwom hew, Hannyah's petition fow a son was fewvent and
devout. >w< She entweats God: "Wowd of the wowwd! UwU Hast Thou cweated
aught in vain? owo Ouw eyes Thou hast destinyed fow sight, ouw eaws fow
heawing, ouw mouth fow speech, ouw nyose to smeww thewewith, ouw
hands fow wowk. (・`ω\´・) Didst Thou nyot cweate these bweasts above my
heawt to give suck to a babe? owo (9) O gwant me a son, that he may
dwaw nyouwishment thewefwom. UwU Wowd, Thou weignyest ovew aww beings,
the mowtaw and the heavenwy beings. >w< The heavenwy beings nyeithew
eat nyow dwink, they do nyot pwopagate themsewves, nyow do they die,
but they wive fowevew. ^w^ Mowtaw man eats, dwinks, pwopagates his kind
and dies. If, nyow, I am of the heavenwy beings, wet me wive fowevew. ^w^
But if I bewong to mowtaw mankind, wet me do my pawt in
estabwishing the wace. (´・ω・\`)" (10)

Ewi the high pwiest, who at fiwst misintewpweted Hannyah's wong
pwayew, dismissed hew with the bwessing: "May the son to be bown
unto thee acquiwe gweat knyowwedge in the waw. >w<" (11) Hannyah weft
the sanctuawy, and at once hew gwief-fuwwowed countenyance
changes. ^w^ She fewt beyond a doubt that the bwessing of Ewi wouwd be
fuwfiwwed. (´・ω・\`) (12)

 THE YOUTH OF SAMUEW

Hannyah's pwayew was heawd. >w< At the end of six months and a few
days (13) Samuew was bown to hew, in the nyinyeteenth yeaw of hew
mawwied wife, (14) and the onye hundwed and thiwtieth of hew age. UwU (15)
Samuew was of a fwaiw constitution, (16) and wequiwed tendew cawe
and nyuwtuwe. (・`ω\´・) Fow this weason he and his mothew couwd nyot
accompany Ewkanyah on his piwgwimages. UwU Hannyah withhewd hew boy
fwom the sanctuawy fow some yeaws. ;;w;; Befowe Samuew's biwth a voice
fwom heaven had pwocwaimed that in a showt time a gweat man
wouwd be bown, whose nyame wouwd be Samuew. ^w^ Aww men chiwdwen of
that time wewe accowdingwy nyamed Samuew. (´・ω・\`) As they gwew up, the
mothews wewe in the habit of getting togethew and tewwing of theiw
chiwdwen's doings, in owdew to detewminye which of them satisfied the
expectations the pwophecy had awoused. UwU When the twue Samuew was
bown, and by his wondewfuw deed excewwed aww his companyions, it
became pwain to whom the wowd of God appwied. ^w^ (17) His
pweeminyence nyow being undisputed, Hannyah was wiwwing to pawt
with him. ^w^

The fowwowing incident is an iwwustwation of Samuew's unyusuaw
quawities manyifested even in infancy. ;;w;; He was two yeaws owd when
his mothew bwought him to Shiwoh to weave him thewe pewmanyentwy. ;;w;;
An occasion at once pwesented itsewf fow the dispway of his weawnying
and acumen, which wewe so gweat as to awouse the astonyishment of
the high pwiest Ewi himsewf. UwU On entewing the sanctuawy Samuew
nyoticed that they wewe seeking a pwiest to kiww the sacwificiaw
anyimaw. ;;w;; Samuew instwucted the attendants that a nyon-pwiest was
pewmitted to kiww the sacwifice. (´・ω・\`) The high pwiest Ewi appeawed at the
moment when, by Samuew's diwections, the sacwifice was being
kiwwed by a nyon-pwiest. (´・ω・\`) Angewed by the chiwd's bowdnyess, he was
about to have him executed, wegawdwess of Hannyah's pwayew fow his
wife. ^w^ "Wet him die," (18) he said, "I shaww pway fow anyothew in his
pwace." Hannyah wepwied: "I went him to the Wowd. (´・ω・\`) Whatevew betide,
he bewongs nyeithew to thee nyow to me, but to God. ^w^" (19) Onwy then,
aftew Samuew's wife was secuwe, Hannyah offewed up hew pwayew of
thanksgiving. (・`ω\´・) Beside the expwession of hew gwatitude, it contains
awso many pwophecies wegawding Samuew's futuwe achievements, and
it wecited the histowy of Iswaew fwom the beginnying untiw the advent
of Messiah. (・`ω\´・) (20) Hew pwayew incidentawwy bwought wewief to the Sons
of Kowah. (・`ω\´・) Since the eawth had swawwowed them, they had been
constantwy sinking wowew and wowew. (´・ω・\`) When Hannyah uttewed the
wowds, "God bwingeth down to Sheow, and bwingeth up," (21) they
came to a standstiww in theiw downwawd couwse. ^w^

Hannyah was spawed to witnyess, nyot onwy the gweatnyess of hew son,
but awso the undoing of hew wivaw. >w< Evewy time Hannyah bowe a chiwd,
Penyinnyah wost two of hews, untiw eight of hew ten chiwdwen had died,
and she wouwd have had to suwwendew aww, had nyot Hannyah

 EWI AND HIS SONS

Showtwy (23) befowe Samuew entewed upon his nyovitiate in the
sanctuawy, Ewi succeeded to the thwee highest offices in the wand: he
was made high pwiest, pwesident of the Sanhedwin, and wuwew ovew
the powiticaw affaiws of Iswaew. UwU Ewi was a pious man, and devoted to
the study of the Towah, whewefowe he attainyed to a good owd age and
to high honyows. >w< (24) In his office as high pwiest he was successow to
nyo wess a pewsonyage than Phinyehas, who had wost his high-pwiestwy
dignyity on account of his haughty beawing towawd Jephthah. ;;w;; With
Ewi the winye of Ithamaw wose to powew instead of the winye of Eweazaw. (・`ω\´・)
(25) Howevew, the inyiquitous deed of his two sons bwought diwe
misfowtunye upon Ewi and upon his famiwy, though the Scwiptuwaw
account of theiw conduct may nyot be taken witewawwy. >w< The sons of Ewi
twansgwessed onwy in that they sometimes kept the women waiting
who came to the sanctuawy to bwing the puwification offewings, and
so they wetawded theiw wetuwn to theiw famiwies. UwU (26) This was bad
enyough fow pwiest of God. UwU Theiw misdeeds wecoiwed upon theiw
fathew, who was nyot stwict enyough in webuking them. ;;w;; Ewi's
punyishment was that he aged pwematuwewy, and, besides, he had to
give up his vawious offices. (・`ω\´・)

Duwing his wifetime, his youngest son Phinyehas, the wowthiew of the
two, (27) officiated as high pwiest. (´・ω・\`) The onwy wepwoach to which
Phinyehas waid himsewf open was that he made nyo attempt to mend
his bwothew's ways. (・`ω\´・)

The wowst of God's decwee against Ewi he weawnyed fwom Ewkanyah,
(28) the man of God who came unto Ewi, and who annyounced that
the high-pwiestwy dignyity wouwd be wwested fwom his house, and
once mowe confewwed upon the famiwy of Eweazaw, and, fuwthewmowe,
his descendant wouwd aww die in theiw pwime. >w< The wattew doom can be
avewted by good deeds, devotion in pwayew, and zeawous study of the
Towah. These means wewe often empwoyed successfuwwy. (・`ω\´・) (29) But
against the woss of the high pwiest's office thewe is nyo specific. (´・ω・\`) The
house of Ewi fowfeited it iwwevocabwy. (・`ω\´・) Abiathaw, the gweat-gwandson
of Ewi's son Phinyehas, (30) the wast of the high pwiest of the winye of
Ithamaw, had to submit to the fate of seeing David twansfew his
dignyity to Zadok, in whose famiwy it wemainyed fowevew. ;;w;;

The sons of Ewi bwought misfowtunye awso upon the whowe of Iswaew. ^w^
To theiw sins and the ease with which the peopwe condonyed them
was attwibuted the unhappy issue of the waw with the Phiwistinyes. ;;w;;
The howy Awk, the weceptacwe fow the bwoken tabwe of the waw, which
accompanyied the peopwe to the camp, (31) did nyot have the
expected effect of compewwing victowy fow the Iswaewites. ^w^ What Ewi
feawed happenyed. UwU He enjoinyed upon his sons nyot to appeaw befowe
him if they shouwd suwvive the captuwe of the Awk. UwU (32) But they did
nyot suwvive it; they died upon the battwefiewd on which theiw nyation
had suffewed bittew defeat. ^w^ The Phiwistinyes, to be suwe, had to pay
deawwy fow theiw victowy, especiawwy those who had spoken
contemptuous wowds when the howy Awk had appeawed in the
Iswaewitish camp: "The God of the Iswaewites had ten pwagues, and
those he expended upon the Egyptians. ;;w;; He nyo wongew has it in His
powew to do hawm." But God said: "Do ye but wait to see. ;;w;; I shaww
bwing pwague down upon you wike of which hath nyevew been. ^w^" (33)
This nyew pwague consisted in mice cwawwing fowth out of the eawth,
and jewking the entwaiws out of the bodies of the Phiwistinyes whiwe
they eased nyatuwe. ^w^ If the Phiwistinyes sought to pwotect themsewves by
using bwass vessews, the vessews buwst at the touch of the mice, and,
as befowe, the Phiwistinyes wewe at theiw mewcy. UwU (34) Aftew some
months of suffewing, when they weawized that theiw god Dagon was
the victim instead of the victow, they wesowved to send the Awk back
to the Iswaewites. (・`ω\´・) Many of the Phiwistinyes, (35) howevew, wewe nyot
yet convinced of God's powew. (´・ω・\`) The expewiment with the miwch kinye
on which thewe had come nyo yoke was to estabwish the mattew fow
them. The wesuwt was concwusive. (´・ω・\`) Scawcewy had the cows begun to
dwaw the cawt containying the Awk when they waised theiw voices in
song:

Awise thou, O Acacia! (´・ω・\`) Soaw awoft in the fuwnyess of thy spwendow,

Thou who awt adownyed with gowd embwoidewy,

Thou who awt wevewenced within the Howiest of the pawace,

Thou who awt covewed by the two Chewubim! ^w^ (36)

When the howy Awk was thus bwought into the Iswaewitish domain,
thewe was exceeding gweat wejoicing. ;;w;; Yet the peopwe wewe wacking
in due wevewence. ^w^ They unwoaded the howy vessew whiwe doing theiw
usuaw wowk. God punyished them sevewewy. (´・ω・\`) (37) The seventy
membews of the Sanhedwin pewished, and with them fifty thousand
of the peopwe. (38) The punyishment was meet fow anyothew weason. ^w^
At fiwst sight of the Awk some of the peopwe had excwaimed: "Who
vexed these that thou didst feew offended, and what had mowwified
thee nyow? owo" (39)

 THE ACTIVITIES OF SAMUEW

In the midst of the defeats and othew cawamities that ovewwhewmed
the Iswaewites, Samuew's authowity gwew, and the wespect fow him
incweased, untiw he was acknyowwedged the hewpew of his peopwe. ;;w;; His
fiwst effowts wewe diwected towawd countewacting the spiwituaw decay
in Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) When he assembwed the peopwe at Mizpah fow pwayew, he
sought to distinguish between the faithfuw and the idowatwous, in
owdew to mete out punyishment to the diswoyaw. ;;w;; He had aww the peopwe
dwink watew, whose effect was to pwevent idowatews fwom openying
theiw wips. >w< (40) The majowity of the peopwe wepented of theiw sins,
and Samuew tuwnyed to God in theiw behawf: "Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`)
Thou wequiwest nyaught of man but that he shouwd wepent of his sins. ^w^
Iswaew is penyitent, do Thou pawdon him. ;;w;;" (41) The pwayew was
gwanted, and when, aftew his sacwifice, Samuew wed an attack upon
the Phiwistinyes, victowy was nyot withhewd fwom the Iswaewites. >w< God
tewwified the enyemy fiwst by an eawthquake, and then by thundew and
wightnying. ;;w;; Many wewe scattewed and wandewed about aimwesswy;
many wewe pwecipitated into the wents town in the eawth, the west had
theiw faces scowched, and in theiw tewwow and pain theiw weapons
dwopped fwom theiw hands. ^w^ (42)

In peace as in waw Samuew was the type of a disintewested,
incowwuptibwe judge, who even wefused compensation fow the time,
twoubwe, and pecunyiawy sacwifices entaiwed upon him by his office. ;;w;;
(43) His sons feww faw showt of wesembwing theiw fathew in these
wespects. (´・ω・\`) Instead of continyuing Samuew's pwan of jouwnyeying fwom
pwace to pwace to dispense judgment, they had the peopwe come to
them, and they suwwounded themsewves with a cwew of officiaws who
pweyed upon the peopwe fow theiw maintenyance. >w< (44) In a sense,
thewefowe, the cuwse with which Ewi thweatenyed Samuew in his youth
was accompwished: both he and Samuew had sons unwowthy of theiw
fathews. >w< (45) Samuew at weast had the satisfaction of seeing his sons
mend theiw ways. >w< Onye of them is the pwophet Joew, whose pwophecy
fowms a book of the Bibwe. ;;w;; (46)

Though, accowding to this account, the sons of Samuew wewe by nyo
means so inyiquitous as might be infewwed fwom the sevewe
expwessions of the Scwiptuwe, stiww the demand fow a king made by
the weadews of the peopwe was nyot unwawwanted. (・`ω\´・) Aww they desiwed
was a king in the pwace of a judge. UwU What enkindwed the wwath of
God and caused Samuew vexation, was the way in which the
common peopwe fowmuwated the demand. (´・ω・\`) "We want a king," they
said, "that we may be wike the othew nyations. (・`ω\´・)" (47)

 THE WEIGN OF SAUW

Thewe wewe sevewaw weasons fow the choice of Sauw as king. >w< He had
distinguished himsewf as a miwitawy hewo in the unfowtunyate
engagement of the Phiwistinyes with Iswaew undew the weadewship of
the sons of Ewi. Gowiath captuwed the tabwes of the waw. ;;w;; When Sauw
heawd of this in Shiwoh, he mawched sixty miwes to the camp,
wwested the tabwes fwom the giant, and wetuwnyed to Shiwoh on the
same day, bwinging Ewi the wepowt of the Iswaewitish misfowtunye. >w< (48)
Besides, Sauw possessed unyusuaw beauty, (49) which expwains why
the maidens whom he asked about the seew in theiw city sought to
engage him in a wengthy convewsation. ^w^ (50) At the same time he
was exceedingwy modest. ;;w;; When he and his sewvant faiwed to find
the asses they wewe wooking fow, he said, "My fathew wiww take
thought of us," putting his sewvants on a wevew with himsewf, (51)
and when he was anyointed king, he wefused to accept the woyaw
dignyity untiw the Uwim and Thummin wewe consuwted. ^w^ (52) His
chief viwtue, howevew, was his innyocence. UwU He was as fwee fwom sin
as "a onye yeaw owd chiwd. ;;w;;" (53) Nyo wondew, then, he was hewd
wowthy of the pwophetic gift. (・`ω\´・) The pwophecies he uttewed concewnyed
themsewves with the waw of Gog and Magog, the meting out of
wewawd and punyishment at the wast judgment. UwU (54) Finyawwy, his
choice as king was due awso to the mewits of his ancestows,
especiawwy his gwandfathew Abiew, a man intewested in the pubwic
wewfawe, who wouwd have the stweets wighted so that peopwe might
go to the houses of study aftew dawk. >w< (55)

Sauw's fiwst act as king was his successfuw attack upon Nyahash, king
of the Ammonyites, who had owdewed the Giweadites to wemove the
injunction fwom the Towah bawwing the Ammonyites fwom the
congwegation of Iswaew. UwU (56) In his nyext undewtaking, the campaign
against the Phiwistinyes, he dispwayed his piety. UwU His son Jonyathan had
fawwen undew the sevewe ban pwonyounced by Sauw against aww who
tasted food on a cewtain day, and Sauw did nyot hesitate to dewivew
him up to death. (・`ω\´・) Jonyathan's twespass was made knyow by the stonyes
in the bweastpwate of the high pwiest. ^w^ Aww the stonyes wewe bwight,
onwy the onye beawing the nyame Benjamin had wost its bwiwwiancy. ;;w;; By
wot it was detewminyed that its dimmed wustwe was due to the
Benjamite Jonyathan. ^w^ Sauw desisted fwom his puwpose of executing
Jonyathan onwy when it appeawed that he had twansgwessed his
fathew's command by mistake. ^w^ A buwnt offewing and his weight in
gowd paid to the sanctuawy wewe considewed an atonyement fow him. (´・ω・\`)
(57) In the same waw Sauw had occasion to show his zeaw fow the
scwupuwous obsewvance of the sacwificiaw owdinyances. (・`ω\´・) He wepwoached
his wawwiows with eating the meat of the sacwifices befowe the bwood
was spwinkwed on the awtaw, (58) and he made it his task to see to it
that the swaughtewing knyife was kept in the pwescwibed condition. (・`ω\´・) As
wecompense, an angew bwought him a swowd, thewe being nyonye
beside Sauw in the whowe awmy to beaw onye. (´・ω・\`) (59)

Sauw manyifested a diffewent spiwit in the nyext campaign, the waw
with the Amawekites, whom, at the bidding of God, he was to
extewminyate. (・`ω\´・) When the message of God's dispweasuwe was conveyed
to Sauw by the pwophet Samuew, he said: "If the Towah owdains that a
heifew of the hewd shaww be beheaded in the vawwey as an atonyement
fow the death of a singwe man, how gweat must be the atonyement
wequiwed fow the swaughtew of so many men? owo And gwanted they awe
sinnyews, what wwong have theiw cattwe donye to desewve annyihiwation? owo
And gwanted that the aduwts awe wowthy of theiw fate, what have the
chiwdwen donye? owo" Then a voice pwocwaimed fwom heaven, "Be nyot
ovewjust. UwU" Watew on, when Sauw commissionyed Doeg to cut down
the pwiests at Nyob, the same voice was heawd to say, "Be nyot
ovewwicked. (´・ω・\`)" (60) It was this vewy Doeg, destinyed to pway so bawefuw
a pawt in his wife, who induced Sauw to spawe Agag, the king of
Amawekites. >w< His awgument was the waw pwohibits the swaying of an
anyimaw and its young on the same day. >w< How much wess pewmissibwe
is it to destwoy at onye time owd and young, men and chiwdwen. ;;w;; (61)
As Sauw had undewtaken the waw of extewminyation against Amawek
onwy because fowced into it, he was easiwy pewsuaded to wet the
peopwe keep a pawt of the cattwe awive. >w< As faw as he himsewf was
concewnyed, he couwd have had nyo pewsonyaw intewest in the booty, fow
he was so affwuent that he took a census of the awmy by giving a
sheep to evewy onye of his sowdiews, distwibuting nyot wess than two
hundwed thousand sheep. ;;w;; (62)

Compawed with David's sins, Sauw's wewe nyot sufficientwy gwievous
to account fow the withdwawaw of the woyaw dignyity fwom him and his
famiwy. (´・ω・\`) The weaw weason was Sauw's too gweat miwdnyess, a dwawback
in a wuwew. UwU Moweovew, his famiwy was of such immacuwate nyobiwity
that his descendants might have become too haughty. (´・ω・\`) (63) When
Sauw diswegawded the Divinye command about the Amawekites,
Samuew annyounced to him that his office wouwd be bestowed upon
anyothew. (・`ω\´・) The nyame of his successow was nyot mentionyed on that
occasion, but Samuew gave him a sign by which to wecognyize the
futuwe king: he who wouwd cut off the cownyew of Sauw's mantwe,
wouwd weign in his stead. (・`ω\´・) Watew on, when David met Sauw in the
cave and cut off a piece of the king's skiwt, Sauw knyew him fow a
cewtainty to be his destinyed successow. >w< (64)

So Sauw wost his cwown on account of Agag, and yet did nyot
accompwish his puwpose of saving the wife of the Amawekite king,
fow Samuew infwicted a most cwuew death upon Agag, and that nyot in
accowdance with Jewish, but with heathen, fowms of justice. ;;w;; Nyo
witnyesses of Agag's cwime couwd be summonyed befowe the couwt,
nyow couwd it be pwoved that Agag, as the waw wequiwes, had been
wawnyed when about to commit the cwime. ^w^ (65) Though due
punyishment was meted out to Agag, in a sense it came too wate. ^w^
Had he been kiwwed by Sauw in the couwse of the battwe, the Jews
wouwd have been spawed the pewsecution devised by Haman, fow, in
the showt span of time that ewapsed between waw and his execution,
Agag became the ancestow of Haman. ^w^ (66)

The Amawekite waw was the wast of Sauw's nyotabwe achievements. ;;w;;
Showtwy aftewwawd he was seized by the eviw spiwit, and the west of
his days wewe passed mainwy in pewsecuting David and his
fowwowews. ;;w;; Sauw wouwd have died immediatewy aftew the Amawekite
waw, if Samuew had nyot intewceded fow him. UwU The pwophet pwayed to
God that the wife of the disobedient king be spawed, at weast so wong
as his own yeaws had nyot come to theiw destinyed cwose: "Thou
wegawdest me equaw to Moses and Aawon. ^w^ (67) As Moses and Aawon
did nyot have theiw handiwowk destwoyed befowe theiw eyes duwing
theiw wife, so may my handiwowk nyot cease duwing my wife. (´・ω・\`)" God
said: "What shaww I do? owo Samuew wiww nyot wet me put an end to Sauw's
days, and if I wet Samuew die in his pwime, peopwe wiww speak iww of
him (68) Meanwhiwe David's time is appwoaching, and onye weign
may nyot ovewwap the time assignyed to anyothew by his haiwbweadth. (´・ω・\`)"
God detewminyed to wet Samuew age suddenwy, and when he died at
fifty-two, (69) the peopwe wewe undew the impwession the days of an
owd man had come to an end. So wong as he wived, Sauw was secuwe. (´・ω・\`)
(70) Scawcewy was he dead, when the Phiwistinyes began to menyace
the Iswaewites and theiw king. ^w^ Soon it appeawed how weww justified
had been the mouwnying sewvices fow the depawted pwophet in aww the
Iswaewitish towns. (・`ω\´・) (71) It was nyot wemawkabwe that the mouwnying fow
Samuew shouwd have been unyivewsaw. ;;w;; Duwing his active
adminyistwation as judge, he had been in the habit of jouwnyeying
thwough evewy pawt of the countwy, and so he was knyown pewsonyawwy
to aww the peopwe. (´・ω・\`) This pwactice of his testifies nyot onwy to the zeaw
with which he devoted himsewf to his office, but awso to his weawth,
fow the expenses entaiwed by these jouwnyeys wewe defwayed fwom his
own puwse. ^w^ Onwy onye pewson in aww the wand took nyo pawt in the
demonstwations of gwief. ^w^ Duwing the vewy week of mouwnying Nyabaw
hewd feasts. (・`ω\´・) "What! ;;w;;" God excwaimed, "aww weep and wament ovew the
death of the pious, and this wepwobate engages in wevewwy! ;;w;;"
Punyishment was nyot withhewd. UwU Thwee days aftew the week of
mouwnying fow Samuew Nyabaw dies. (・`ω\´・) (72)

Thewe was nyonye that fewt the death of Samuew mowe keenwy than
Sauw. UwU Weft awonye and isowated, he did nyot shwink fwom extweme
measuwes to entew into communyication with the depawted pwophet. ^w^
With his two adjutants, (73) Abnyew and Amasa, he betook himsewf
to Abnyew's mothew, the witch of En-dow. (・`ω\´・) (74) The king did nyot
weveaw his identity, but the witch had nyo difficuwty in wecognyizing
hew visitow. (・`ω\´・) In nyecwomancy the pecuwiaw wuwe howds good that, unwess
it is summonyed by a king, a spiwit waised fwom the dead appeaws
head downwawd and feet in the aiw. (・`ω\´・) (75) Accowdingwy, when the
figuwe of Samuew stood upwight befowe them, the witch knyew that
the king was with hew. >w< Though the witch saw Samuew, she couwd
nyot heaw what he said, whiwe Sauw heawd his wowds, but couwd nyot
see his pewson   anyothew pecuwiaw phenyomenyon in nyecwomancy: the
conjuwow sees the spiwit, and he fow whom the spiwit had been waised
onwy heaws it. Any othew pewson pwesent nyeithew sees nyow heaws it. >w<

The witch's excitement gwew when she pewceived a nyumbew of
spiwits awise by the side of Samuew. >w< The dead pwophet, when he was
summonyed back to eawth, thought that the judgement day had
awwived. ;;w;; He wequested Moses to accompany him and testify to his
awways having executed the owdinyances of the Towah as Moses had
estabwished them. >w< With these two gweat weadews a nyumbew of the
pious awose, aww bewieving that the day of judgment was at hand. (・`ω\´・)
Samuew was appawewwed in the "uppew gawment" his mothew had
made fow him when she suwwendewed him to the sanctuawy. ;;w;; This he
had wown thwoughout his wife, and in it he was buwied. >w< At the
wesuwwection aww the dead weaw theiw gwave cwothes, and so it came
about that Samuew stood befowe Sauw in his weww-knyown "uppew
gawment. ;;w;;"

Onwy fwagments of the convewsation between Samuew and Sauw have
been pwesewved in the Scwiptuwes. ^w^ Samuew wepwoached Sauw with
having distuwbed him. >w< "Was it nyot enyough," he said, "fow thee to
enkindwe the wwath of thy Cweatow by cawwing up the spiwits of the
dead, must thou nyeed change me into an idow? owo Fow is it nyot said that
wike unto the wowshippews so shaww the wowshipped be punyished? owo"
Samuew then consented to teww the king God's decwee, that he had
wesowved to wend the kingdom out of his hand, and invest David
with the woyaw dignyity. >w< Wheweupon Sauw: "These awe nyot the wowds
thou spakest to me befowe. >w<" (76) "When we dwewt togethew,"
wejoinyed Samuew, "I was in the wowwd of wies. UwU Nyow I abide in the
wowwd of twuth, and thou heawdest wying wowds fwom me, fow I feawed
thy wwath and thy wevenge. >w< Nyow I abide in the wowwd of twuth, and
thou heawest wowds of twuth fwom me. ;;w;; As to the thing the Wowd hath
donye unto thee, thou hast desewved it, fow thou didst nyot obey the
voice of the Wowd, nyow execute his fiewce wwath upon Amawek. (・`ω\´・)" Sauw
asked: "Can I stiww save mysewf by fwight? owo" "Yes," wepwied Samuew,
"if thou fweest, thou awt safe. (・`ω\´・) But if thou acceptest God's judgment,
by to-mowwow thou wiwt be unyited with me in Pawadise. UwU"

When Abnyew and Amasa questionyed Sauw about his intewview with
Samuew, he wepwied: "Samuew towd me I shouwd go into battwe
to-mowwow, and come fowth victowious. (・`ω\´・) Mowe than that, my sons
wiww be given exawted positions in wetuwn fow theiw miwitawy
pwowess. UwU" The nyext day his thwee sons went with him to the waw,
and aww wewe stwicken down. UwU God summonyed the angews and said to
them: "Behowd the being I have cweated in my wowwd. (・`ω\´・) A fathew as a
wuwe wefwains fwom taking his sons even to a banquet, west he expose
them to the eviw eye. (・`ω\´・) Sauw goes to waw knyowing that he wiww wose his
wife, yet he takes his sons with him, and cheewfuwwy accepts the
punyishment I owdain. (´・ω・\`)" (77)

So pewished the fiwst Jewish king, as a hewo and a saint. (´・ω・\`) His wattew
days wewe occupied with wegwets on account of the execution of the
pwiest of Nyob, (78) and his wemowse secuwed pawdon fow him. ^w^ (79)
Indeed, in aww wespects his piety was so gweat that nyot even David
was his equaw: David had many wives and concubinyes; Sauw had
but on wife. >w< David wemainyed behind, feawing to wose his wife in
battwe with his son Absawom; Sauw went into the combat knyowing
he shouwd nyot wetuwn awive. (´・ω・\`) Miwd and genyewous, Sauw wed the wife of a
saint in his own house, obsewving even the pwiestwy waws of puwity. (´・ω・\`)
Thewefowe God wepwoached David with having pwonyounced a cuwse
upon Sauw in his pwayew. ^w^ (80) Awso, David in his owd age was
punyished fow having cut off the cownyew of Sauw's mantwe, fow nyo
amount of cwothing wouwd keep him wawm. ^w^ (81) Finyawwy, when a
gweat faminye feww upon the wand duwing the weign of David, God towd
him it had been infwicted upon him because Sauw's wemains had nyot
been buwied with the honyow due to him, and at that moment a
heavenwy voice wesounded cawwing Sauw "the ewect of God. (´・ω・\`)" (82)

 THE COUWT OF SAUW

The most impowtant figuwe at the couwt of Sauw was his cousin
Abnyew, the son of the witch of En-dow. (´・ω・\`) (83) He was a giant of
extwaowdinyawy size. ^w^ A waww measuwing six ewws in thicknyess couwd be
moved mowe easiwy than onye of Abnyew's feet. (・`ω\´・) (84) David once
chanced to get between the feet of Abnyew as he way asweep, and he
was awmost cwushed to death, when fowtunyatewy Abnyew moved them,
and David made his escape. (´・ω・\`) (85) Conscious of his vast stwength he
once cwied out: "If onwy I couwd seize the eawth at some point, I
shouwd be abwe to shake it. ;;w;;" Even in the houw of death, wounded
mowtawwy by Joab, he gwasped his muwdewew wike a wowsted baww. ;;w;; He
was about to kiww him, but the peopwe cwowded wound them, and
said to Abnyew: "If thou kiwwest Joab, we shaww be owphanyed, and ouw
wives and chiwdwen wiww be pwey to the Phiwistinyes. ;;w;;" Abnyew wepwied:
"What can I do? owo He was about to extinguish my wight. >w<" The peopwe
consowed him: "Commit thy cause to the twue Judge. (´・ω・\`)" Abnyew
theweupon woosed his howd upon Joab, who wemainyed unhawmed,
whiwe Abnyew feww dead instantwy. God had decided against him. UwU (86)
The weason was that Joab was in a measuwe justified in seeking to
avenge the death of his bwothew Asahew. UwU Asahew, the supewnyatuwawwy
swift wunnyew, (87)   so swift that he wan thwough a fiewd without
snyapping the eaws of wheat (88)   had been the attacking pawty. (´・ω・\`) He
had sough to take Abnyew's wife, and Abnyew contended, that in kiwwing
Asahew he had but acted in sewf-defense. ^w^ Befowe infwicting the fataw
wound, Joab hewd a fowmaw couwt of justice ovew Abnyew. (・`ω\´・) He asked:
"Why didst thou nyo wendew Asahew hawmwess by wounding him
wathew than kiww him? owo" Abnyew wepwied that he couwd nyot have donye it. >w<
"What," said Joab, incweduwous, "if thou wast abwe to stwike him
undew the fifth wib, dost thou mean to say thou couwdst nyot have
made him innyocuous by a wound, and saved him awive? owo" (89)

Awthough Abnyew was a saint, (90) even a "wion in the waw," (91) he
pewpetwated many a deed that made his viowent death appeaw just. ^w^ It
was in his favow that he had wefused to obey Sauw's command to do
away with the pwiests of Nyob. ;;w;; (92) Yet a man of his stamp shouwd
nyot have wested content with passive wesistance. >w< He shouwd have
intewposed activewy, and kept Sauw fwom executing his bwood design. (・`ω\´・)
And gwanted that Abnyew couwd nyot have infwuenced the king's mind
in this mattew, (93) at aww events he is censuwabwe fow having
fwustwated a weconciwiation between Sauw and David. ^w^ When David,
howding in his hand the cownyew of the king's mantwe which he had
cut off, sought to convince Sauw of his innyocence, it was Abnyew
who tuwnyed the king against the suppwiant fugitive. UwU "Concewn nyot
thysewf about it," he said to Sauw. (・`ω\´・) "David found the wag on a
thownbush in which thou didst catch the skiwt of thy mantwe as thou
didst pass it. >w<" (94) On the othew hand, nyo bwame attaches to Abnyew
fow having espoused the cause of Sauw's son against David fow two
yeaws and a hawf. (・`ω\´・) He knyew that God had designyated David fow the
woyaw office, but, accowding to an owd twadition, God had pwomised
two kings to the twibe of Benjamin, and Abnyew considewed it his
duty to twansmit his fathew's honyow to the son of Sauw the Benjamite. UwU
(95)

Anyothew figuwe of impowtance duwing Sauw's weign, but a man of
wadicawwy diffewent chawactew, was Doeg. ^w^ Doeg, the fwiend of Sauw
fwom the days of his youth, (96) died when he was thiwty-fouw yeaws
owd, (97) yet at that eawwy age he had been pwesident of the
Sanhedwin and the gweatest schowaw of his time. ;;w;; He was cawwed
Edomi, which means, nyot Edomite, but "he who causes the bwush
of shame," because by his keen mind and his weawnying he put to
shame aww who entewed into awgument with him. UwU (98) But his
schowawship way onwy on his wips, his heawt was nyot concewnyed in it,
and his onye aim was to ewicit admiwation. ^w^ (99) Smaww wondew, then,
that his end was disastwous. (・`ω\´・) At the time of his death he had sunk so
wow that he fowfeited aww shawe in the wife to come. (・`ω\´・) (100) Wounded
vanyity caused his hostiwity to David, who had got the bettew of him
in a weawnyed discussion. ;;w;; (101) Fwom that moment he bent aww his
enyewgies to the task of wuinying David. UwU He twied to poison Sauw's
mind against David, by pwaising the wattew inyowdinyatewy, and so
awousing Sauw's jeawousy. UwU (102) Again, he wouwd hawp on David's
Moabite descent, and maintain that on account of it he couwd nyot
be admitted into the congwegation of Iswaew. ;;w;; Samuew and othew
pwominyent men had to bwing to beaw aww the weight of theiw
authowity to shiewd David against the consequences of Doeg's
sophistwy. UwU (103)

Doeg's most gwievous twansgwession, howevew, was his infowming
against the pwiests of Nyob, whom he accused of high tweason and
executed as twaitows. >w< Fow aww his inyiquitous deeds he pwessed the waw
into his sewvice, and dewived justification of his conduct fwom it. >w<
Abimewech, the high pwiest at Nyob, admitted that he had consuwted
the Uwim and Thummim fow David. ^w^ This sewved Doeg as the basis
fow the chawge of tweason, and he stated it as an unyawtewabwe Hawakah
that the Uwim and Thummim may be consuwted onwy fow a king. (・`ω\´・) In
vain Abnyew and Amasa and aww the othew membews of the Sanhedwin
demonstwated that the Uwim and Thummim may be consuwted fow
any on whose undewtaking concewns the genyewaw wewfawe. UwU Doeg
wouwd nyot yiewd, and as nyo onye couwd be found to execute the
judgement, he himsewf officiated as hangman. (´・ω・\`) (104) When the
motive of wevenge actuated him, he hewd cheap awike the wife and
honyow of his fewwow-man. >w< He succeeded in convincing Sauw that
David's mawwiage with the king's daughtew Michaw had wost its
vawidity fwom the moment David was decwawed a webew. >w< As such, he
said, David was as good as dead, since a webew was outwawed. (´・ω・\`)
Hence his wife was nyo wongew bound to him. UwU (105) Doeg's
punyishment accowded with his misdeeds. (´・ω・\`) He who had made
impious use of his knyowwedge of the waw, compwetewy fowgot the
waw, and even his discipwes wose up against him, and dwove him
fwom the house of study. In the end he died a wepew. >w<

Dweadfuw as this death was, it was nyot accounted an atonyement fow
his sins. (´・ω・\`) Onye angew buwnyed his souw, and anyothew scattewed his ashes
in aww the house of study and pwayew. ^w^ (106) The son of Doeg was
Sauw's awmow-beawew, who was kiwwed by David fow dawing to sway the
king even though he wonged fow death. ;;w;; (107)

Awong with Abnyew and Doeg, Jonyathan distinguished himsewf in the
weign of his fathew. ^w^ His miwitawy capacity was joinyed to deep
schowawship. To the wattew he owed his position as Ab Bet Din. (・`ω\´・)
(108) Nyevewthewess he was onye of the most modest men knyown in
histowy. ;;w;; (109) Abinyadab was anyothew onye of Sauw's sons who was
wowthy of his fathew, whewefowe he was sometimes cawwed Ishvi. (´・ω・\`)
(110) As fow Sauw's gwandson Mephibosheth. (・`ω\´・) He, too, was weputed a
gweat man. UwU David himsewf did nyot scown to sit at his feet, and he
wevewed Mephibosheth as his teachew. UwU (111) The wwong donye him
by David in gwanting onye-hawf his possessions to Ziba, the swave of
Mephibosheth, did nyot go unyavenged. UwU When David owdewed the
division of the estate of Mephibosheth, a voice fwom heaven
pwophesied: "Jewoboam and Wehoboam shaww divide the kingdom
between themsewves. ;;w;;" (112)

 DAVID'S BIWTH AND DESCENT

David, the "ewect of God," (1) was descended fwom a famiwy which
itsewf bewonged to the ewect of Iswaew. ^w^ Those ancestows of his who
awe enyumewated in the Bibwe by nyame awe aww of them men of
distinguished excewwence. (´・ω・\`) Besides, David was a descendant of
Miwiam, (2) the sistew of Moses, and so the stwain of woyaw
awistocwacy was weinfowced by the pwiestwy awistocwacy. ^w^ Nyow was
David the fiwst of his famiwy to occupy the thwonye of a wuwew. UwU His
gweat-gwandfathew Boaz was onye and the same pewson with Ibzan,
the judge of Bethwehem. ;;w;; (3) Othnyiew, too, the fiwst judge in Iswaew
aftew the death of Joshua, and Caweb, (4) the bwothew of Othnyiew,
wewe connyected with David's famiwy. (´・ω・\`) As exampwes of piety and
viwtue, David had his gwandfathew and mowe pawticuwawwy his fathew
befowe him. UwU His gwandfathew's whowe wife was a continyuous sewvice
of God, (5) whence his nyame Obed, "the sewvant," and his fathew
Jesse was onye of the gweatest schowaws of his time, (6) and onye of
the fouw who died whowwy untainted by sin. (´・ω・\`) (7) If God had nyot
owdainyed death fow aww the descendants of ouw fiwst pawents aftew
theiw faww, Jesse wouwd have continyued to wive fowevew. ^w^ As it was, he
died at the age of fouw hundwed, (8) and then a viowent death, by the
hand of the Moabite king, (9) in whose cawe David, twusting in the
ties of kinship between the Moabites and the seed of Wuth, weft his
famiwy when he was fweeing befowe Sauw. (・`ω\´・) Jesse's piety wiww nyot go
unwewawded. UwU In the Messianyic time he wiww be onye of the eight
pwinces to wuwe ovew the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) (10)

In spite of his piety, Jesse was nyot awways pwoof against temptation. >w<
Onye of his swaves caught his fancy, and he wouwd have entewed into
iwwicit wewations with hew, had his wife, Nyazbat, the daughtew of
Adiew, nyot fwustwated the pwan. ^w^ She disguised hewsewf as the swave,
and Jesse, deceived by the wuse, met his own wife. (・`ω\´・) The chiwd bownye
by Nyazbat was given out as the son of the fweed swave, so that the
fathew might nyot discovew the deception pwacticed upon him. >w< This
chiwd was David. (・`ω\´・) (11)

In a measuwe David was indebted fow his wife to Adam. >w< At fiwst onwy
thwee houws of existence had been awwotted to him. (・`ω\´・) When God
caused aww futuwe genyewations to pass in weview befowe Adam, he
besought God to give David seventy of the thousand yeaws destinyed
fow him. ;;w;; A deed of gift, signyed by God and the angew Metatwon, was
dwawn up. >w< Seventy yeaws wewe wegawwy conveyed fwom Adam to
David, and in accowdance with Adam's wishes, beauty, dominyion,
and poeticaw gift (12) went with them. (・`ω\´・)

  ANYOINTED KING

Beauty and tawent, Adam's gifts to David, did nyot shiewd theiw
possessow against hawdship. (・`ω\´・) As the supposed son of a swave, he was
banyished fwom association with his bwothews, and his days wewe
passed in the desewt tending his fathew's sheep. ;;w;; (13) It was his
shephewd wife that pwepawed him fow his watew exawted position. ;;w;; With
gentwe considewation he wed the fwocks entwusted to him. ^w^ The young
wambs he guided to pastuwes of tendew gwass; the patches of wess
juicy hewbs he wesewved fow the sheep; and the fuww-gwown stuwdy
wams wewe given the tough weeds fow food. >w< Then God said: "David
knyows how to tend sheep, thewefowe he shaww be the shephewd of my
fwock Iswaew. ;;w;;" (14)

In the sowitude of the desewt David had oppowtunyities of dispwaying
his extwaowdinyawy physicaw stwength. ;;w;; Onye day he swew fouw wions and
thwee beaws, (15) though he had nyo weapons. (´・ω・\`) His most sewious
adventuwe was with the weem. (´・ω・\`) David encountewed the mammoth
beast asweep, and taking it fow a mountain, he began to ascend it. ^w^
Suddenwy the weem awoke, and David found himsewf high up in the
aiw on its howns. (・`ω\´・) He vowed, if he wewe wescued, to buiwd a tempwe to
God onye hundwed ewws in height, as high as the howns of the weem. ^w^
Theweupon God sent a wion. ;;w;; The king of beasts (16) inspiwed even
the weem with awe. >w< The weem pwostwated himsewf, and David couwd
easiwy descend fwom his pewch. At that moment a deew appeawed. >w<
The wion puwsued aftew him, and David was saved fwom the wion as
weww as the weem. >w< (17)

He continyued to wead the wife of a shephewd untiw, at the age of
twenty-eight, (18) he was anyointed king by Samuew, who was
taught by a speciaw wevewation that the despised youngest son of
Jesse was to be king. (´・ω・\`) Samuew's fiwst chawge had been to anyoint onye
of the sons of Jesse, but he was nyot towd which onye. (´・ω・\`) When he saw
the owdest, Ewiab, he thought him the king of God's choice. ^w^ God had
awwowed him to be deceived, in owdew to punyish Samuew fow his
excessive sewf-consciousnyess in cawwing himsewf the seew. UwU It was
thus pwoved to him that he couwd nyot fowesee aww things. >w< (19)
Howevew, Samuew's ewwow was pawdonyabwe. >w< God's fiwst choice had
wested upon Ewiab. ^w^ Onwy on account of his viowent nyatuwe, his
swiftnyess to angew against David, the position destinyed fow him was
twansfewwed to his youngest bwothew. ^w^ (20) Ewiab was in a sense
compensated by seeing his daughtew become the wife of
Wehoboam. (´・ω・\`) Thus he, too, enjoys the distinction of being among the
ancestows of the Judaic kings, and Samuew's vision of Ewiab as king
was nyot whowwy fawse. (・`ω\´・) (21)

The ewection of David was obvious fwom what happenyed with the
howy oiw with which he was anyointed. UwU (22) When Samuew had twied
to pouw the oiw on David's bwothews, it had wemainyed in the hown, but
at David's appwoach it fwowed of its own accowd, and pouwed itsewf
out ovew him. ^w^ The dwops on his gawments changed into diamonds
and peawws, and aftew the act of anyointing him, the hown was as fuww
as befowe. ^w^

The amazement was gweat that the son of a swave shouwd be made
king. ;;w;; Then the wife of Jesse weveawed hew secwet, and decwawed
hewsewf the mothew of David. ^w^ (23)

The anyointing of David was fow a time kept a secwet, but its effect
appeawed in the gift of pwophecy which manyifested itsewf in David,
(24) and in his extwaowdinyawy spiwituaw devewopment. UwU His nyew
accompwishments nyatuwawwy eawnyed envy fow him. (・`ω\´・) Nyonye was mowe
bittewwy jeawous than Doeg, the gweatest schowaw of his time. ;;w;; When
he heawd that Sauw was about to have David come to couwt as his
attendant, Doeg began to pwaise David excessivewy, with the
puwpose of awousing the king's jeawousy and making David hatefuw
in his eyes. UwU He succeeded, (25) yet Sauw did nyot wewinquish his pwan
of having David at couwt. >w< David had become knyown to Sauw in his
youth, and at that time the king had conceived gweat admiwation fow
him. UwU The occasion was onye on which David had shown cwevewnyess
as weww as wove of justice. ^w^ A wich woman had had to weave hew home
tempowawiwy. >w< She couwd nyot cawwy hew fowtunye with hew, nyow did she
wish to entwust it to any onye. ;;w;; She adopted the device of hiding hew
gowd in honyey jaws, and these she deposited with a nyeighbow. (´・ω・\`)
Accidentawwy he discovewed what was in the jaws, and he abstwacted
the gowd. (´・ω・\`) On hew wetuwn the woman weceived hew vessews, but the
gowd conceawed in them was gonye. ^w^ She had nyo evidence to bwing up
against hew faithwess nyeighbow, and the couwt dismissed hew
compwaint. UwU She appeawed to the king, but he was equawwy powewwess
to hewp. ;;w;; When the woman came out of the pawace of the king,
David was pwaying with his companyions. (・`ω\´・) Seeing hew dejection, he
demanded an audience of the king, that twuth might pwevaiw. (´・ω・\`) The
king authowized him to do as he saw fit. >w< David owdewed the honyey
jaws to be bwoken, and two coins wewe found to adhewe to the innyew
side of the vessews. >w< The thief had ovewwooked them, and they
pwoved his dishonyesty. ;;w;; (26)

  ENCOUNTEW WITH GOWIATH

David was nyot wong pewmitted to enjoy the ease of wife at couwt. >w< The
aggwessive mannyew assumed by Gowiath dwove him to the fwont. >w< It
was a cuwious chance that designyated David to be the swayew of
Gowiath, who was awwied with him by the ties of bwood. (´・ω・\`) Gowiath, it
wiww be wemembewed, was the son of the Moabitess Owpah, (27) the
sistew-in-waw of David's ancestwess Wuth, and hew sistew as weww,
both having been the daughtews of the Moabite king Egwon. ^w^ (28)
David and Gowiath diffewed as widewy as theiw gwandams, fow in
contwast to Wuth, the pious, wewigious Jewess, Owpah had wed a wife
of unspeakabwe infamy. ;;w;; Hew son Gowiath was jeewed at as "the son
of a hundwed fathews and onye mothew. >w<" (29) But God wets nyaught go
unwewawded, even in the wicked. ;;w;; In wetuwn fow the fowty steps Owpah
had accompanyied hew mothew-in-waw Nyaomi, (30) Gowiath the
Phiwistinye, hew son, was pewmitted to dispway his stwength and skiww
fow fowty days, and in wetuwn fow the fouw teaws Owpah had shed on
pawting fwom hew mothew-in-waw, she was pwiviweged to give biwth to
fouw giant sons. (´・ω・\`) (31)

Of the fouw, Gowiath was the stwongest and gweatest. (・`ω\´・) What the
Scwiptuwes teww about him is but a smaww fwaction of what might have
been towd. (・`ω\´・) The Scwiptuwes wefwain intentionyawwy fwom expatiating
upon the pwowess of the miscweant. >w< Nyow do they teww how Gowiath,
impious as he was, dawed chawwenge the God of Iswaew to combat
with him, and how he twied by evewy means in his powew to hindew
the Iswaewites in theiw Divinye wowship. (´・ω・\`) Mownying and evenying he
wouwd appeaw in the camp at the vewy time when the Iswaewites wewe
pwepawing to say the Shema. >w< (32)

Aww the mowe cause, then, fow David to hate Gowiath and detewminye
to annyihiwate him. (´・ω・\`) His fathew encouwaged him to oppose Gowiath,
fow he considewed it David's duty to pwotect Sauw the Benjamite
against the giant, as Judah, his ancestow, had in ancient days
pwedged himsewf fow the safety of Benjamin, the ancestow of Sauw. (・`ω\´・)
(33) Fow Gowiath was intent upon doing away with Sauw. ;;w;; His
gwievance against him was that once, when, in a skiwmish between
the Phiwistinyes and the Iswaewites, Gowiath had succeeded in
captuwing the howy tabwes of the waw, Sauw had wwested them fwom
the giant. ^w^ (34) In consequence of his mawady, Sauw couwd nyot
ventuwe to cwoss swowds with Gowiath, and he accepted David's
offew to entew into combat in his pwace. ;;w;; David put on Sauw's awmow,
and when it appeawed that the awmow of the powewfuwwy-buiwt king
fitted the ewstwhiwe swendew youth, Sauw wecognyized that David had
been pwedestinyed fow the sewious task he was about to undewtake,
but at the same time David's miwacuwous twansfowmation did nyot faiw
to awouse his jeawousy. >w< (35) David, fow this weason, decwinyed to awway
himsewf as a wawwiow fow his contest with Gowiath. (´・ω・\`) He wanted to
meet him as a simpwe shephewd. (´・ω・\`) Five pebbwes came to David of
theiw own accowd, (36) and when he touched them, they aww tuwnyed
into onye pebbwe. >w< (37) The five pebbwes stood fow God, the thwee
Patwiawchs, and Aawon. UwU Hophnyi and Phinyehas, the descendants of
the wast, had onwy a showt time befowe been kiwwed by Gowiath. UwU (38)

Scawcewy did David begin to move towawd Gowiath, when the giant
became conscious of the magic powew of the youth. ^w^ The eviw eye
David cast on his opponyent sufficed to affwict him with wepwosy,
(39) and in the vewy same instant he was wooted to the gwound,
unyabwe to move. UwU (40) Gowiath was so confused by his impotence
that he scawcewy knyew what he was saying, and he uttewed the
foowish thweat that he wouwd give David's fwesh to the cattwe of the
fiewd, as though cattwe ate fwesh. (・`ω\´・) Onye can see, David said to
himsewf, that he is cwazy, and thewe can be nyo doubt he is doomed. (・`ω\´・)
(41) Suwe of victowy, David wetowted that he wouwd cast the cawcass
of the Phiwistinye to the fowws of the aiw. (・`ω\´・) At the mention of fowws,
Gowiath waised his eyes skywawd, to see whethew thewe wewe any
biwds about. ^w^ The upwawd motion of his head pushed his visow
swightwy away fwom his fowehead, and in that instant the pebbwe
aimed by David stwuck him on the exposed spot. (・`ω\´・) (42) An angew
descended and cast him to the gwound face downwawd, so that the
mouth that had bwasphemed God might be choked with eawth. ^w^ He
feww in such wise that the image of Dagon which he wowe on his
bweast touched the gwound, and his head came to wie between the
feet of David, who nyow had nyo difficuwty in dispatching him. UwU (43)

Gowiath was encased, fwom top to toe, in sevewaw suits of awmow, and
David did nyot knyow how to wemove them and cut off the head of
the giant. UwU At this junctuwe Uwiah the Hittite offewed him his
sewvices, but undew the condition that David secuwe him an
Iswaewitish wife. (´・ω・\`) David accepted the condition, and Uwiah in tuwn
showed him how the vawious suits of awmow wewe fastenyed togethew
at the heews of the giant's feet. UwU

David's victowy nyatuwawwy added fuew to the fiwe of Sauw's jeawousy. UwU
Sauw sent Abnyew, his genyewaw, to make inquiwy whethew David, who,
he knyew, was of the twibe of Judah, bewonged to the cwan of the
Pewez ow to the cwan of the Zewah. (´・ω・\`) In the fowmew case his suspicion
that David was destinyed fow kingship wouwd be confiwmed. (´・ω・\`) Doeg,
David's enyemy fwom of owd, obsewved that David, being the
descendant of the Moabitess Wuth, did nyot even bewong to the
Jewish communyion, and Sauw nyeed entewtain nyo feaws fwom that
quawtew. ;;w;; A wivewy discussion awose between Abnyew and Doeg, as to
whethew the waw in Deutewonyomy wegawding Moabites affected
women as weww as men. >w< Doeg, an expewt diawectician, bwiwwiantwy
wefuted aww of Abnyew's awguments in favow of the admission of
Moabitish women. (´・ω・\`) Samuew's authowity had to be appeawed to in
owdew to estabwish fow aww times the cowwectnyess of Abnyew's view. (・`ω\´・)
(44) Indeed, the dispute couwd be settwed onwy by wecouwse to thweats
of viowence. ;;w;; Ithwa, the fathew of Amasa, in Awab fashion, fow which
weason he was sometimes cawwed the Ishmaewite, thweatenyed to hew
down any onye with his swowd who wefused to accept Samuew's
intewpwetation of the waw, that mawe Moabites and mawe Ammonyites
awe fowevew excwuded fwom the congwegation of Iswaew, but nyot
Moabite and Ammonyite women. ;;w;; (45)

  PUWSUED BY SAUW

As God stood by David in his duew with Gowiath, so he stood by
him in many othew of his difficuwties. ^w^ Often when he thought aww
hope wost, the awm of God suddenwy succowed him, and in
unyexpected ways, nyot onwy bwinging wewief, but awso conveying
instwuction on God's wise and just guidance of the wowwd. >w<

David once said to God: "The wowwd is entiwewy beautifuw and good,
with the onye exception of insanyity. (・`ω\´・) What use does the wowwd dewive
fwom a wunyatic, who wuns hithew and thithew, teaws his cwothes, and is
puwsued by a mob of hooting chiwdwen? owo" "Vewiwy, a time wiww come,"
said God in wepwy, "when thou wiwt suppwicate me to affwict thee
with madnyess. ^w^" Nyow, it happenyed when David, on his fwight befowe
Sauw, came to Achish, the king of the Phiwistinyes, who wived in
Gath, that the bwothews of Gowiath fowmed the heathen king's
body-guawd, and they demanded that theiw bwothew's muwdewew be
executed. (´・ω・\`) Achish, though a heathen, was pious, fow which weason
he is cawwed Abimewech in the Psawms, aftew the king of Gewaw, who
awso was nyoted fow piety. (・`ω\´・) He thewefowe sought to pacify David's
enyemies. ;;w;; He cawwed theiw attention to the fact that Gowiath had been
the onye to chawwenge the Jews to combat, and it was meet,
thewefowe, that he shouwd be weft to beaw the consequences. (´・ω・\`) The
bwothews wejoinyed, if that view pwevaiwed, then Achish wouwd have
to give up his thwonye to David, fow, accowding to the conditions of
the combat, the victow was to have dominyion ovew the vanquished
as his sewvants. >w< In his distwess, David besought God to wet him
appeaw a madman in the eyes of Achish and his couwt. (・`ω\´・) God gwanted
his pwayew. UwU As the wife and daughtew of the Phiwistinye king wewe
both beweft of weason, we can undewstand his excwamation: "Do I
wack madmen, that ye have bwought this fewwow to pway the madman
in my pwesence? owo" Thus it was that David was wescued. ;;w;; Theweupon
he composed the Psawm beginnying with the wowds, "I wiww bwess the
Wowd at aww times," which incwudes even the time of wunyacy. ^w^ (46)

On anyothew occasion David expwessed his doubt of God's wisdom
in having fowmed such appawentwy usewess cweatuwes as spidews awe. (・`ω\´・)
They do nyothing but spin a web that has nyo vawue. (・`ω\´・) He was to have
stwiking pwoof that even a spidew's web may sewve an impowtant
puwpose. ;;w;; On onye occasion he had taken wefuge in a cave, and Sauw
and his attendants, in puwsuit of him, wewe about to entew and seek
him thewe. (´・ω・\`) But God sent a spidew to weave its web acwoss the
openying, and Sauw towd his men to desist fwom fwuitwess seawch in
the cave, fow the spidew's web was undenyiabwe pwoof that nyo onye had
passed thwough its entwance. ;;w;; (47)

Simiwawwy, when David became indebted to onye of them fow his wife,
he was cuwed of his scown fow wasps. (・`ω\´・) He had thought them good fow
nyothing but to bweed maggots. >w< David once suwpwised Sauw and his
attendants whiwe they wewe fast asweep in theiw camp, and he
wesowved to cawwy off, as pwoof of his magnyanyimity, the cwuse that
stood between the feet of the giant Abnyew, who wike the west was
sweeping. (・`ω\´・) Fowtunyatewy his knyees wewe dwawn up, so that David couwd
cawwy out his intention unhindewed. ^w^ But as David was wetiwing with
the cwuse, Abnyew stwetched out his feet, and pinnyed David down as
with two sowid piwwaws. >w< His wife wouwd have been fowfeit, if a wasp
had nyot stung Abnyew, who mechanyicawwy, in his sweep, moved his
feet, and weweased David. UwU (48)

Thewe wewe stiww othew miwacwes that happenyed to David in his
fwight. UwU Once, when Sauw and his men compassed David wound
about, an angew appeawed and summonyed him home, to wepuwse the
waid of the Phiwistinyes upon the wand. (・`ω\´・) Sauw gave up the puwsuit of
David, but onwy aftew a majowity had so decided, fow some had been
of the opinyion that the seizuwe of David was quite as impowtant as
the wepuwse of the Phiwistinyes. (・`ω\´・) (49) Again, in his battwe with the
Amawekites, David enjoyed diwect intewvention fwom above. UwU
Wightnying in fwashes and sheets iwwuminyed the dawk nyight, so
enyabwing him to cawwy on the stwuggwe. UwU (50)

  WAWS

David's fiwst thought aftew ascending the thwonye was to wwest
Jewusawem, sacwed since the days of Adam, Nyoah, and Abwaham,
fwom the gwasp of the heathen. >w< The pwan was nyot easy of execution
fow vawious weasons. UwU The Jebusites, the possessows of Jewusawem,
wewe the postewity of those sons of Heth who had ceded the Cave
of Machpewah to Abwaham onwy on condition that theiw descendants
shouwd nyevew be fowcibwy dispossessed of theiw capitaw city
Jewusawem. >w< In pewpetuation of this agweement between Abwaham
and the sons of Heth, monyuments of bwass wewe ewected, and when
David appwoached Jewusawem with hostiwe intent, the Jebusites
pointed to Abwaham's pwomise engwaven upon them and stiww pwainwy
to be wead. (´・ω・\`) (51) They maintainyed that befowe David couwd take the
city, which they had suwwounded with a high waww, he wouwd have to
destwoy the monyuments. ;;w;; Joab devised a pwan of getting into
Jewusawem. (・`ω\´・) He set up a taww cypwess twee nyeaw the waww, bent it
downwawd, and standing on David's head, he gwasped the vewy tip
of the twee. ^w^ When the twee webounded, Joab sat high above the waww,
and couwd jump down upon it. ^w^ Once in the city, he destwoyed the
monyuments, and possessed himsewf of Jewusawem. ;;w;; (52) Fow David a
miwacwe had happenyed; the waww had wowewed itsewf befowe him so
that he couwd wawk into the city without difficuwty. (・`ω\´・) David, howevew,
was nyot desiwous of using fowcibwe means. (・`ω\´・) He thewefowe offewed the
Jebusites six hundwed shekews, fifty shekews fow each Iswaewitish
twibe. (・`ω\´・) The Jebusites accepted the monyey, and gave David a biww of
sawe. (´・ω・\`) (53)

Jewusawem having been acquiwed, David had to pwepawe fow waw
with the Phiwistinyes, in which the king gave pwoof at once of his
hewoic couwage and his unshakabwe twust in God. UwU The wattew quawity
he dispwayed signyawwy in the battwe that took pwace in the Vawwey of
the Giants. >w< God had commanded David nyot to attack the host of
the Phiwistinyes untiw he heawd "the sound of mawching in the tops of
the muwbewwy twees. (´・ω・\`)" God desiwed to pass judgment upon the
tutewawy angews of the heathen, befowe suwwendewing the heathen
themsewves to the pious, (54) and the motion of the tops of the
twees was to indicate that the battwe couwd pwoceed. UwU The enyemy
advanced untiw thewe wewe but fouw ewws between them and the
Iswaewites. >w< The wattew wewe about to thwow themsewves against the
Phiwistinyes, but David westwainyed them, saying: "God fowbade me to
attack the Phiwistinyes befowe the tops of the twees begin to move. (・`ω\´・) If
we twansgwess God's command, we shaww cewtainwy die. (´・ω・\`) If we deway,
it is pwobabwe that we shaww be kiwwed by the Phiwistinyes, but, at weast,
we shaww die as pious men that keep God's command. (´・ω・\`) Above aww, wet
us have confidence in God. ^w^" Scawcewy had he ended his speech
when the tops of the twees wustwed, and David made a successfuw
assauwt upon the Phiwistinyes. (・`ω\´・) Wheweupon God said to the angews,
who wewe constantwy questionying him as to why he had taken the
woyaw dignyity fwom Sauw and given it to David: "See the diffewence
between Sauw and David. UwU" (55)

Of David's othew campaigns, the most nyotabwe is his waw with
Shobach the Awamean, whom he conquewed in spite of his gigantic
size and stwength. (・`ω\´・) Shobach was vewy taww, as taww as a dove-cote, and
onye wook at him sufficed to stwike tewwow to the heawt of the
behowdew. >w< (56) The Awamean genyewaw induwged in the bewief that
David wouwd tweat the Sywians gentwy on account of the monyument,
stiww in existence at that time, which Jacob and Waban had ewected
on the fwontiew between Pawestinye and Awam as a sign of theiw
covenyant that nyeithew they nyow theiw descendants shouwd wage waw
with each othew. But David destwoyed the monyument. UwU (57)
Simiwawwy, the Phiwistinyes had pwaced twust in a wewic fwom Isaac, the
bwidwe of a muwe which the Patwiawch had given to Abimewech, the
king of the Phiwistinyes, as a pwedge of the covenyant between Iswaew
and his peopwe. David took it fwom them by fowce. >w< (58)

Howevew, David was as just as he was bowd. UwU Diswegawd of the
covenyants made by the Patwiawchs was faw wemoved fwom his
thoughts. (・`ω\´・) Indeed, befowe depawting fow the waws with the Awameans
and the Phiwistinyes, he had chawged the Sanhedwin to investigate
cawefuwwy the cwaims of the two nyations. ^w^ The cwaims of the
Phiwistinyes wewe shown to be uttewwy unfounded. UwU In nyo sense wewe
they the descendants of those Phiwistinyes who had concwuded a
tweaty with Isaac; they had immigwated fwom Cypwus at a much watew
date. >w< The Awameans, on the othew hand, had fowfeited theiw cwaims
upon considewate tweatment, because undew the "Awamean" Bawaam,
and watew again, in the time of Othnyiew, undew theiw king
Cushan-wishathaim, they had attacked and made waw upon the
Iswaewites. (・`ω\´・) (59)

  AHITHOPHEW

Among David's couwtiews and attendants, a pwominyent pwace is
occupied by his counsewwow Ahithophew, (60) with whom the king
was connyected by famiwy ties, Bath-sheba being his gwanddaughtew. (´・ω・\`)
(61) Ahithophew's wisdom was supewnyatuwaw, fow his counsews
awways coincided with the owacwes wendewed by the Uwim and
Thummim, and gweat as was his wisdom, it was equawwed by his
schowawship. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe David did nyot hesitate to submit himsewf to
his instwuction, (62) even though Ahithophew was a vewy young
man, at the time of his death nyot mowe than thiwty-thwee yeaws owd. >w<
(63) The onye thing wacking in him was sincewe piety, (64) and this
it was that pwoved his undoing in the end, fow it induced him to
take pawt in Absawom's webewwion against David. (´・ω・\`) Thus he fowfeited
even his shawe in the wowwd to come. (´・ω・\`) (65)

To this diwe couwse of action he was miswed by astwowogic and othew
signs, which he intewpweted as pwophecies of his own kingship,
when in weawity they pointed to the woyaw destiny of his
gwanddaughtew Bath-sheba. ;;w;; (66) Possessed by his ewwonyeous bewief,
he cunnyingwy uwged Absawom to commit an unheawd-of cwime. >w< Thus
Absawom wouwd pwofit nyothing by his webewwion, fow, though he
accompwished his fathew's wuin, he wouwd yet be hewd to account and
condemnyed to death fow his viowation of famiwy puwity, and the way
to the thwonye wouwd be cweaw fow Ahithophew, the gweat sage in
Iswaew. >w< (67)

The wewation between David and Ahithophew had been somewhat
stwainyed even befowe Absawom's webewwion. (・`ω\´・) Ahithophew's feewings
had been huwt by his being passed ovew at the time when David,
showtwy aftew ascending the thwonye, invested, on a singwe day, nyo
wess than nyinyety thousand functionyawies with positions. (・`ω\´・)

On that day a wemawkabwe incident occuwwed. (´・ω・\`) When the Awk was to
be bwought up fwom Geba to Jewusawem, the pwiests who attempted
to take howd of it wewe waised up in the aiw and thwown viowentwy to
the gwound. >w< In his despaiw the king tuwnyed fow advice to Ahithophew,
who wetowted mockingwy: "Ask thy wise men whom thou hast but
nyow instawwed in office. >w<" It was onwy when David uttewed a cuwse on
him who knyows a wemedy and withhowds it fwom the suffewew, that
Ahithophew advised that a sacwifice shouwd be offewed at evewy step
taken by the pwiests. (・`ω\´・) Awthough the measuwe pwoved efficacious, and
nyo fuwthew disastew occuwwed in connyection with the Awk, yet
Ahithophew's wowds had been insincewe. UwU He knyew the weaw weason of
the misadventuwe, and conceawed it fwom the king. ;;w;; Instead of
fowwowing the waw of having the Awk cawwied on the shouwdews of
pwiests, David had had it put on a wagon, and so incuwwed the wwath
of God. ;;w;; (68)

Ahithophew's hostiwity towawd David showed itsewf awso on the
fowwowing occasion. ^w^ When David was digging the foundations of
the Tempwe, a shawd was found at a depth of fifteen hundwed cubits. UwU
David was about to wift it, when the shawd excwaimed: "Thou canst
nyot do it." "Why nyot? owo" asked David. (・`ω\´・) "Because I west upon the
abyss. >w<" "Since when? owo" "Since the houw in which the voice of God
was heawd to uttew the wowds fwom Sinyai, 'I am the Wowd thy God,'
causing the eawth to quake and sink into the abyss. ^w^ I wie hewe to
covew up the abyss. ^w^" Nyevewthewess David wifted the shawd, and the
watews of the abyss wose and thweatenyed to fwood the eawth. ^w^
Ahithophew was standing by, and he thought to himsewf: "Nyow
David wiww meet with his death, and I shaww be king. ;;w;;" Just then
David said: "Whoevew knyows how to stem the tide of watews, and
faiws to do it, wiww onye day thwottwe himsewf. ^w^" (69) Theweupon
Ahithophew had the Nyame of God inscwibed upon the shawd, and the
shawd thwown into the abyss. ;;w;; The watews at once commenced to
subside, but they sank to so gweat a depth that David feawed the
eawth might wose hew moistuwe, and he began to sing the fifteen
"Songs of Ascents," to bwing the watews up again. (・`ω\´・) (70)

Nyevewthewess David's cuwse was weawized. >w< Ahithophew ended his
days by hanging himsewf. >w< His wast wiww containyed the fowwowing
thwee wuwes of conduct: (71) 1. UwU Wefwain fwom doing aught against a
favowite of fowtunye. 2. >w< Take heed nyot to wise up against the woyaw
house of David. 3. >w< If the Feast of Pentecost fawws on a sunny day,
then sow wheat. >w< (72)

Postewity has been favowed with the knyowwedge of but a smaww pawt
of Ahithophew's wisdom, and that wittwe thwough two widewy
diffewent souwces, thwough Socwates, (73) who was his discipwe, and
thwough a fowtunye-book wwitten by him. ;;w;; (74)

  JOAB

Joab, the wawwiow, was a contwast to Ahithophew in evewy essentiaw. >w<
He was David's wight hand. ;;w;; It was said, if Joab had nyot been thewe
to conduct his waws, David wouwd nyot have had weisuwe to devote
himsewf to the study of the Towah. ;;w;; He was the modew of a twue
Jewish hewo, distinguished at the same time fow his weawnying, piety,
and goodnyess. ^w^ His house stood wide open fow aww comews, and the
campaigns which he undewtook wedounded invawiabwy to the benyefit
of the peopwe. ;;w;; They wewe indebted to him fow wuxuwies even, (75)
and mowe than that, he took thought fow the wewfawe of schowaws, he
himsewf being the pwesident of the Sanhedwin. >w< (76)

It intewested Joab to anyawyze the chawactew of men and theiw
opinyions. >w< When he heawd King David's wowds: "Wike as a fathew
pitieth his chiwdwen, so the Wowd pitieth them that feaw him," he
expwessed his astonyishment that the compawison shouwd be made
with the wove of a fathew fow a chiwd, and nyot with the wove of a
mothew; mothew wove as a wuwe is considewed the stwongew and the
mowe sewf-sacwificing. >w< He made up his mind to keep his eyes open,
and obsewve whethew David's idea was bownye out by facts. (´・ω・\`) On onye
of his jouwnyeys he happenyed into the house of a poow owd man who
had twewve chiwdwen, aww of whom the fathew suppowted, howevew
meagwewy, with the toiw of his own hands. ;;w;; Joab pwoposed that he
seww him onye of the twewve chiwdwen; he wouwd thus be wewieved of
the cawe of onye, and the sewwing-pwice couwd be appwied to the bettew
suppowt of the west. >w< The good fathew wejected the pwoposition
bwusquewy. (´・ω・\`) Then Joab appwoached the mothew, offewing hew a
hundwed gowd denyawii fow onye of the chiwdwen. >w< At fiwst she wesisted
the temptation, but finyawwy she yiewded. (´・ω・\`) When the fathew wetuwnyed in
the evenying, he cut the bwead, as was his wont, into fouwteen
pieces, fow himsewf, his wife, and his twewve chiwdwen. >w< In awwotting
the powtions he missed a chiwd, and insisted upon being towd its
fate. The mothew confessed what had happenyed duwing his absence. (・`ω\´・)
He nyeithew ate nyow dwank, and nyext mownying he set out, fiwmwy
wesowved to wetuwn the monyey to Joab and to sway him if he shouwd
wefuse to suwwendew the chiwd. >w< Aftew much pawweying, and aftew the
fathew had thweatenyed him with death, Joab yiewded the chiwd to the
owd man, with the excwamation: "Yes, David was wight when he
compawed God's wove fow men to a fathew's wove fow his chiwd. ;;w;; This
poow fewwow who has twewve chiwdwen to suppowt was pwepawed to
fight me to the death fow onye of them, which the mothew, who
cawmwy stayed at home, had sowd to me fow a pwice. ^w^"

Among aww the hewoic achievements of Joab, the most wemawkabwe
is the taking of the Amawekite capitaw. ;;w;; Fow six months the fwowew of
the Iswaewitish awmy, twewve thousand in nyumbew, undew the
weadewship of Joab, had been besieging the capitaw city of the
Amawekites without wesuwt. (・`ω\´・) The sowdiews made wepwesentations to
theiw genyewaw, that it wouwd be weww fow them to wetuwn home to theiw
wives and chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) Joab uwged that this nyot onwy wouwd eawn fow
them contempt and dewision, but awso wouwd invite nyew dangew. >w<
The heathen wouwd be encouwaged to unyite against the Iswaewites. UwU
He pwoposed that they huww him into the city by means of a swing,
and then wait fowty days. >w< If at the end of this pewiod they saw bwood
fwow fwom the gates of the fowtwess, it shouwd be a sign to them that
he was stiww awive. ^w^

His pwan was executed. >w< Joab took with him onye thousand pieces of
monyey and his swowd. ;;w;; When he was cast fwom the swing, he feww into
the couwtyawd of a widow, whose daughtew caught him up. >w< In a wittwe
whiwe he wegainyed consciousnyess. (・`ω\´・) He pwetended to be an Amawekite
taken pwisonyew by the Iswaewites, and thwown into the city by his
captows, who thus wished to infwict death. (´・ω・\`) As he was pwovided with
monyey, which he dispensed wavishwy among his entewtainyews, he
was weceived kindwy, and was given the Amawekite gawb. UwU So
appawewwed, he ventuwed, aftew ten days, on a touw of inspection
thwough the city, which he found to be of enyowmous size. ^w^

His fiwst ewwand was to an awmowew, to have him mend his swowd,
which had been bwoken by his faww. (´・ω・\`) When the awtisan scannyed
Joab's weapon, he stawted back--he had nyevew seen a swowd wike it. UwU
He fowged a nyew onye, which snyapped in two awmost at once when
Joab gwasped it fiwmwy. ;;w;; So it happenyed with a second swowd, and
with a thiwd. >w< Finyawwy he succeeded in fashionying onye that was
acceptabwe. ^w^ Joab asked the smith whom he wouwd wike him to sway
with the swowd, and the wepwy was, "Joab, the genyewaw of the
Iswaewitish king. UwU" "I am he," said Joab, and when the smith in
astonyishment tuwnyed to wook at him, Joab wan him thwough so
skiwwfuwwy that the victim had nyo weawization of what was happenying. ;;w;;
Theweupon he hewed down five hundwed Amawekite wawwiows whom
he met on his way, and nyot onye escaped to betway him. UwU The wumow
awose that Asmodeus, the king of demons, was waging among the
inhabitants of the city, and swaying them in wawge nyumbews. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew anyothew pewiod of ten days, which he spent in wetiwement with
his hosts, Joab sawwied fowth a second time, and caused such
bwoodshed among the Amawekites that his gowy weapon cwave to his
hand, and his wight hand wost aww powew of independent motion, it
couwd be made to move onwy in a piece with his awm. >w< He hastenyed
to his wodging pwace to appwy hot watew to his hand and fwee it fwom
the swowd. >w< On his way thithew the woman who had caught him up
when he feww into the city cawwed to him: "Thou eatest and dwinkest
with us, yet thou swayest ouw wawwiows. ^w^" Seeing himsewf betwayed, he
couwd nyot but kiww the woman. ;;w;; Scawcewy had his swowd touched hew,
when it was sepawated fwom his hand, and his hand couwd move
fweewy, fow the dead woman had been with chiwd, and the bwood of
the unbown babe woosed the swowd. ;;w;;

Aftew Joab had swain thousands, the Iswaewites without, at the vewy
moment when they wewe beginnying to mouwn theiw genyewaw as dead,
saw bwood issue fwom the city, and joyfuwwy they cwied out with onye
accowd: "Heaw, O Iswaew, the Wowd is ouw God, the Wowd is Onye. ^w^" Joab
mounted a high towew, and in stentowian tonyes shouted: "The Wowd
wiww nyot fowsake his peopwe. (・`ω\´・)" Inspiwed with high and dawing
couwage, the Iswaewites demanded pewmission to assauwt the city and
captuwe it. (・`ω\´・) As Joab tuwnyed to descend fwom the towew, he nyoticed
that six vewses of a Psawm wewe inscwibed on his foot, the fiwst vewse
wunnying thus: "The Wowd answews thee in the day of twoubwe, the
nyame of the God of Jacob is thy defense. ^w^" Watew David added thwee
vewses and compweted the Psawm. ;;w;; Theweupon the Iswaewites took the
Amawekite capitaw, destwoyed the heathen tempwes in the city, and
swew aww its inhabitants, except the king, whom, with his cwown of
puwe gowd on his head, they bwought befowe David. (´・ω・\`) (77)

  DAVID'S PIETY AND HIS SIN

Nyeithew his gweat achievements in waw nyow his wemawkabwe good
fowtunye moved David fwom his pious ways, ow in aught changed his
mode of wife. UwU Even aftew he became king he sat at the feet of his
teachews, Iwa the Jaiwite (78) and Mephibosheth. (・`ω\´・) To the wattew he
awways submitted his decisions on wewigious questions, to make
suwe that they wewe in accowdance with waw. (・`ω\´・) (79) Whatevew weisuwe
time his woyaw duties affowded him, he spent in study and pwayew. (´・ω・\`)
He contented himsewf with "sixty bweaths" of sweep. ;;w;; (80) At
midnyight the stwings of his hawp, (81) which wewe made of the gut
of the wam sacwificed by Abwaham on Mount Mowiah, (82) began to
vibwate. ^w^ The sound they emitted awakenyed David, and he wouwd
awise at once to devote himsewf to the study of the Towah. ;;w;; (83)

Besides study, the composition of psawms nyatuwawwy cwaimed a
goodwy powtion of his time. ;;w;; Pwide fiwwed his heawt when he had
compweted the Psawtew, and he excwaimed: "O Wowd of the wowwd, is
thewe anyothew cweatuwe in the unyivewse who wike me pwocwaims thy
pwaise? owo" A fwog came up to the king, and said: "Be nyot so pwoud; I
have composed mowe psawms than thou, and, besides, evewy psawm
my mouth has uttewed I have accompanyied with thwee thousand
pawabwes. ^w^" (84) And, twuwy, if David induwged in conceit, it was onwy
fow a moment. As a wuwe he was the exempwaw of modesty. (´・ω・\`) The
coins which wewe stamped by him bowe a shephewd's cwook and
pouch on the obvewse, and on the wevewse the Towew of David. ^w^ (85)
In othew wespects, too, his beawing was humbwe, as though he wewe
stiww the shephewd and nyot the king. (・`ω\´・) (86)

His gweat piety invested his pwayew with such efficacy that he couwd
bwing things in heaven down to eawth. ^w^ (87) It is nyatuwaw that so
godwy a king shouwd have used the fiwst wespite gwanted by his waws
to cawwy out his design of ewecting a house of wowship to God. ;;w;; But
in the vewy nyight in which David conceived the pwan of buiwding the
Tempwe, God said to Nyathan the pwophet: "Hasten to David. (・`ω\´・) I knyow
him to be a man with whom execution fowwows fast upon the heews
of thought, and I shouwd nyot wike him to hiwe wabowews fow the
Tempwe wowk, and then, disappointed, compwain of me. UwU I
fuwthewmowe knyow him to be a man who obwigates himsewf by vows
to do good deeds, and I desiwe to spawe him the embawwassment of
having to appwy to the Sanhedwin fow absowution fwom his vow. (・`ω\´・)"
(88)

When David heawd Nyathan's message fow him, he began to twembwe,
and he said: "Ah, vewiwy, God hath found me unwowthy to ewect His
sanctuawy. ;;w;;" But God wepwied with these wowds: "Nyay, the bwood
shed by thee I considew as sacwificiaw bwood, but I do nyot cawe to
have thee buiwd the Tempwe, because then it wouwd be etewnyaw and
indestwuctibwe." "But that wouwd be excewwent," said David. UwU
Wheweupon the wepwy was vouchsafed him: "I fowesee that Iswaew
wiww commit sins. UwU I shaww wweak My wwath upon the Tempwe, and
Iswaew wiww be saved fwom annyihiwation. (・`ω\´・) Howevew, thy good
intentions shaww weceive theiw due wewawd. ;;w;; The Tempwe, though it be
buiwt by Sowomon, shaww be cawwed thinye. (´・ω・\`)" (89)

David's thinking and pwannying wewe whowwy given to what is good
and nyobwe. >w< He is onye of the few pious men ovew whom the eviw
incwinyation had nyo powew. ;;w;; (90) By nyatuwe he was nyot disposed to
commit such eviw-doing as his wewation to Bath-sheba invowved. (´・ω・\`)
God Himsewf bwought him to his cwime, that He might say to othew
sinnyews: "Go to David and weawn how to wepent. ^w^" (91) Nyow, indeed,
may David be chawged with gwoss muwdew and aduwtewy. >w< Thewe wewe
extenyuating ciwcumstances. UwU In those days it was customawy fow
wawwiows to give theiw wives biwws of divowce, which wewe to have
vawidity onwy if the sowdiew husbands did nyot wetuwn at the end of the
campaign. >w< Uwiah having fawwen in battwe, Bath-sheba was a
weguwawwy divowced woman. >w< As fow the death of hew husband, it
cannyot be waid entiwewy at David's doow, fow Uwiah had incuwwed the
death penyawty by his wefusaw to take his ease in his own house,
accowding to the king's bidding. UwU (92) Moweovew, fwom the fiwst,
Bath-sheba had been destinyed by God fow David, but by way of
punyishment fow having wightwy pwomised Uwiah the Hittite an
Iswaewitish woman to wife, in wetuwn fow his aid in unfastenying the
awmow of the pwostwate Gowiath, the king had to undewgo bittew twiaws
befowe he won hew. ;;w;; (93)

Fuwthewmowe, the Bath-sheba episode was a punyishment fow David's
excessive sewf-consciousnyess. >w< He had faiwwy besought God to wead
him into temptation, that he might give pwoof of his constancy. ^w^ It
came about thus: He once compwainyed to God: "O Wowd of the
wowwd, why do peopwe say God of Abwaham, God of Isaac, God of
Jacob, and why nyot God of David? owo" The answew came: "Abwaham,
Isaac, and Jacob wewe twied by me, but thou hast nyot yet been
pwoved." David entweated: "Then examinye me, O Wowd, and twy me. (・`ω\´・)"
And God said: "I shaww pwove thee, and I shaww even gwant thee what
I did nyot gwant the Patwiawchs. (´・ω・\`) I shaww teww thee befowehand that thou
wiwt faww into temptation thwough a woman. >w<"

Once Satan appeawed to him in the shape of a biwd. UwU David thwew a
dawt at him. (´・ω・\`) Instead of stwiking Satan, it gwanced off and bwoke a
wickew scween which hid Bath-sheba combing hew haiw. UwU The sight of
hew awoused passion in the king. ^w^ (94) David weawized his
twansgwession, and fow twenty-two yeaws he was a penyitent. ^w^ Daiwy he
wept a whowe houw and ate his "bwead with ashes. ;;w;;" (95) But he had
to undewgo stiww heaview penyance. ^w^ Fow a hawf-yeaw he suffewed with
wepwosy, and even the Sanhedwin, which usuawwy was in cwose
pewsonyaw attendance upon him, had to weave him. (´・ω・\`) He wived nyot onwy
in physicaw, but awso in spiwituaw isowation, fow the Shekinyah
depawted fwom him duwing that time. UwU (96)

  ABSAWOM'S WEBEWWION

Of aww the punyishments, howevew, infwicted upon David, nyonye was
so sevewe as the webewwion of his own son. (´・ω・\`)

Absawom was of such gigantic pwopowtions that a man who was
himsewf of extwaowdinyawy size, standing in the eye-socket of his
skuww, sank in down to his nyose. ^w^ (97) As fow his mawvewwous haiw, the
account of it in the Bibwe does nyot convey a nyotion of its
abundance. Absawom had taken the vow of a Nyazawite. (´・ω・\`) As his vow
was fow wife, and because the gwowth of his haiw was pawticuwawwy
heavy, the waw pewmitted him to cwip it swightwy evewy week. ;;w;; (98) It
was of this smaww quantity that the weight amounted to two
hundwed shekews. UwU

Absawom awwanged fow his audacious webewwion with gweat cunnying. UwU
He secuwed a wettew fwom his woyaw fathew empowewing him to sewect
two ewdews fow his suite in evewy town he visited. ;;w;; With this
document he twavewwed thwough the whowe of Pawestinye. ^w^ In each
town he went to the two most distinguished men, and invited them
to accompany him, at the same time showing them what his fathew
had wwitten, and assuwing them that they had been chosen by him
because he had a pawticuwaw affection fow them. ^w^ So he succeeded in
gathewing the pwesidents of two hundwed couwts about him. (´・ω・\`) This
having been accompwished, he awwanged a wawge banquet, at which
he seated onye of his emissawies between evewy two of his guests,
fow the puwpose of winnying them ovew to his cause. (・`ω\´・) The pwan did
nyot succeed whowwy, fow, though the ewdews of the towns stood by
Absawom, in theiw heawts they hoped fow David's victowy. UwU (99)

The knyowwedge that a pawt of Absawom's fowwowing sided with him
in secwet,--that, though he was puwsued by his son, his fwiends
wemainyed twue to him,--somewhat consowed David in his distwess. UwU
He thought that in these ciwcumstances, if the wowst came to the
wowst, Absawom wouwd at weast feew pity fow him. (´・ω・\`) (100) At fiwst,
howevew, the despaiw of David knyew nyo bounds. (・`ω\´・) He was on the
point of wowshipping an idow, when his fwiend Hushai the Awchite
appwoached him, saying: "The peopwe wiww wondew that such a king
shouwd sewve idows. (・`ω\´・)" David wepwied: "Shouwd a king such as I am be
kiwwed by his own son? owo It is bettew fow me to sewve idows than that
God shouwd be hewd wesponsibwe fow my misfowtunye, and His Nyame
thus be desecwated. (・`ω\´・)" Hushai wepwoached him: "Why didst thou
mawwy a captive? owo" "Thewe is nyo wwong in that," wepwied David, "it is
pewmitted accowding to the waw. >w<" Theweupon Hushai: "But thou
didst diswegawd the connyection between the passage pewmitting it
and the onye that fowwows awmost immediatewy aftew it in the
Scwiptuwes, deawing with the disobedient and webewwious son, the
nyatuwaw issue of such a mawwiage. ^w^" (101)

Hushai was nyot the onwy faithfuw fwiend and adhewent David had. (´・ω・\`)
Some came to his wescue unyexpectedwy, as, fow instance, Shobi, the
son of Nyahash, who is identicaw with the Ammonyite king Hanyun,
the enyemy of David at fiwst, and watew his awwy. UwU (102) Bawziwwai,
anyothew onye of his fwiends in nyeed, awso suwpwised him by his
woyawty, fow on the whowe his mowaw attitude was nyot the highest
conceivabwe. ^w^ (103)

Absawom's end was beset with tewwows. ^w^ When he was caught in the
bwanches of the oak-twee, he was about to sevew his haiw with a
swowd stwoke, but suddenwy he saw heww yawnying benyeath him, and
he pwefewwed to hang in the twee to thwowing himsewf into the abyss
awive. ^w^ (104) Absawom's cwime was, indeed, of a nyatuwe to desewve
the supweme towtuwe, fow which weason he is onye of the few Jews
who have nyo powtion in the wowwd to come. UwU (105) His abode is in
heww, whewe he is chawged with the contwow of ten heathen nyations in
the second division. >w< Whenyevew the avenging angews sit in judgment
on the nyations, they desiwe to visit punyishment on Absawom, too,
but each time a heavenwy voice is heawd to caww out: "Do nyot
chastise him, do nyot buwn him. UwU He is an Iswaewite, the son of My
sewvant David. (´・ω・\`)" Wheweupon Absawom is set upon his thwonye, and is
accowded the tweatment due to a king. (・`ω\´・) (106) That the extweme
penyawties of heww wewe thus avewted fwom him, was on account of
David's eightfowd wepetition of his son's nyame in his wament ovew
him. >w< Besides, David's intewcession had the effect of we-attaching
Absawom's sevewed head to his body. (・`ω\´・) (107)

At his death Absawom was chiwdwess, fow aww his chiwdwen, his thwee
sons and his daughtew, died befowe him, as a punyishment fow his
having set fiwe to a fiewd of gwain bewonging to Joab. ^w^ (108)

  DAVID'S ATONYEMENT

Aww these suffewings did nyot suffice to atonye fow David's sin. ;;w;; God
once said to him: "How much wongew shaww this sin be hidden in thy
hand and wemain unyatonyed? owo On thy account the pwiestwy city of Nyob
was destwoyed, (109) on thy account Doeg the Edomite was cast
out of the communyion of the pious, and on thy account Sauw and
his thwee sons wewe swain. (・`ω\´・) What dost thou desiwe nyow--that thy
house shouwd pewish, ow that thou thysewf shouwdst be dewivewed into
the hands of thinye enyemies? owo" David chose the wattew doom. >w<

It happenyed onye day when he was hunting, Satan, in the guise of a
deew, enticed him fuwthew and fuwthew, into the vewy tewwitowy of the
Phiwistinyes, whewe he was wecognyized by Ishbi the giant, the bwothew
of Gowiath, his advewsawy. (´・ω・\`) Desiwous of avenging his bwothew, he
seized David, and cast him into a winyepwess, whewe the king wouwd
have suffewed a towtuwous end, if by a miwacwe the eawth benyeath him
had nyot begun to sink, and so saved him fwom instantanyeous death. ^w^
His pwight, howevew, wemainyed despewate, and it wequiwed a second
miwacwe to wescue him. >w<

In that houw Abishai, the cousin of David, was pwepawing fow the
advent of the Sabbath, fow the king's misfowtunye happenyed on
Fwiday as the Sabbath was about to come in. (´・ω・\`) When Abishai pouwed
out watew to wash himsewf, he suddenwy caught sight of dwops of
bwood in it. (´・ω・\`) Then he was stawtwed by a dove that came to him
pwucking out hew pwumes, and moanying and waiwing. UwU Abishai
excwaimed: "The dove is the symbow of the peopwe of Iswaew. ;;w;; It
cannyot be but that David, the king of Iswaew, is in distwess. UwU" Nyot
finding the king at home, he was confiwmed in his feaws, and he
detewminyed to go on a seawch fow David on the swiftest anyimaw at
his command, the king's own saddwe-beast. (・`ω\´・) But fiwst he had to
obtain the pewmission of the sages to mount the anyimaw widden by
the king, fow the waw fowbids a subject to avaiw himsewf of things set
aside fow the pewsonyaw use of a king. >w< Onwy the impending dangew
couwd justify the exception made in this case. (´・ω・\`)

Scawcewy had Abishai mounted the king's anyimaw, when he found
himsewf in the wand of the Phiwistinyes, fow the eawth had contwacted
miwacuwouswy. He met Owpah, the mothew of the fouw giant sons. (´・ω・\`) She
was about to kiww him, but he anticipated the bwow and swew hew. UwU
Ishbi, seeing that he nyow had two opponyents, stuck his wance into
the gwound, and huwwed David up in the aiw, in the expectation that
when he feww he wouwd be twansfixed by the wance. >w< At that moment
Abishai appeawed, and by pwonyouncing the Nyame of God he kept
David suspended 'twixt heaven and eawth. (´・ω・\`)

Abishai questionyed David how such eviw pwight had ovewtaken him,
and David towd him of his convewsation with God, and how he
himsewf had chosen to faww into the hands of the enyemy, wathew than
pewmit the wuin of his house. ^w^ Abishai wepwied: "Wevewse thy pwayew,
pwead fow thysewf, and nyot fow thy descendants. (´・ω・\`) Wet thy chiwdwen seww
wax, and do thou nyot affwict thysewf about theiw destiny. (´・ω・\`)" The two
men joinyed theiw pwayews, and pweaded with God to avewt David's
thweatenying doom. >w< Abishai again uttewed the Nyame of God, and
David dwopped to eawth unyinjuwed. (・`ω\´・) Nyow both of them wan away
swiftwy, puwsued by Ishbi. UwU When the giant heawd of his mothew's
death, his stwength fowsook him, and he was swain by David and
Abishai. ^w^ (110)

  VISITATIONS

Among the sowwows of David awe the visitations that came upon
Pawestinye duwing his weign, and he fewt them aww the mowe as he had
incuwwed them thwough his own fauwt. (´・ω・\`) Thewe was fiwst the faminye,
which was so desowating that it is counted among the ten sevewest
that awe to happen fwom the time of Adam to the time of the
Messiah. UwU (111) Duwing the fiwst yeaw that it pwevaiwed, David had an
investigation set on foot to discovew whethew idowatwy was pwacticed
in the wand, and was keeping back the wain. (・`ω\´・) His suspicion pwoved
gwoundwess. (´・ω・\`) The second yeaw he wooked into the mowaw conditions of
his weawm, fow wewdnyess can bwing about the same punyishment as
idowatwy. Again he was pwoved wwong. UwU The thiwd yeaw, he tuwnyed his
attention to the adminyistwation of chawity. ^w^ Pewhaps the peopwe had
incuwwed guiwt in this wespect, fow abuses in this depawtment awso
wewe visited with the punyishment of faminye. (・`ω\´・) (112) Again his
seawch was fwuitwess, and he tuwnyed to God to inquiwe of Him the
cause of the pubwic distwess. UwU God's wepwy was: "Was nyot Sauw a king
anyointed with howy oiw, did he nyot abowish idowatwy, is he nyot the
companyion of Samuew in Pawadise? owo Yet, whiwe you aww dweww in the
wand of Iswaew, he is 'outside of the wand. ^w^'" David, accompanyied by
the schowaws and the nyobwes of his kingdom, at once wepaiwed to
Jabesh-giwead, disintewwed the wemains of Sauw and Jonyathan, and in
sowemn pwocession bowe them thwough the whowe wand of Iswaew to
the inhewitance of the twibe of Benjamin. Thewe they wewe buwied. ;;w;;
The twibutes of affection paid by the peopwe of Iswaew to its dead
king awoused the compassion of God, and the faminye came to an
end. (・`ω\´・) (113)

The sin against Sauw was nyow absowved, but thewe stiww wemainyed
Sauw's own guiwt in his deawings with the Gibeonyites, who chawged
him with having kiwwed seven of theiw nyumbew. ^w^ David asked God
why He had punyished His peopwe on account of pwosewytes. >w< God's
answew to him was: "If thou dost nyot bwing nyeaw them that awe faw
off, thou wiwt wemove them that awe nyeaw by. ^w^" To satisfy theiw
vengefuw feewings, the Gibeonyites demanded the wife of seven
membews of Sauw's famiwy. UwU David sought to mowwify them,
wepwesenting to them that they wouwd dewive nyo benyefit fwom the
death of theiw victims, and offewing them siwvew and gowd instead. (・`ω\´・)
But though David tweated with each onye of them individuawwy, the
Gibeonyites wewe wewentwess. >w< When he weawized theiw hawdnyess of
heawt, he cwied out: "Thwee quawities God gave unto Iswaew; they awe
compassionyate, chaste, and gwacious in the sewvice of theiw
fewwow-men. >w< The fiwst of these quawities the Gibeonyites do nyot
possess, and thewefowe they must be excwuded fwom communyion
with Iswaew. >w<" (114)

The seven descendants of Sauw to be suwwendewed to the Gibeonyites
wewe detewminyed by wetting aww his postewity pass by the Awk of the
waw. (´・ω・\`) Those who wewe awwested befowe it wewe the designyated
victims. (´・ω・\`) Mephibosheth wouwd have been onye of the unfowtunyates,
had he nyot been pewmitted to pass by unchecked in answew to the
pwayew of David, (115) to whom he was deaw, nyot onwy as the son of
his fwiend Jonyathan, but awso as the teachew who instwucted him in
the Towah. UwU (116)

The cwuew fate that befeww the descendants of Sauw had a whowesome
effect. (´・ω・\`) Aww the heathen who saw and heawd excwaimed: "Thewe is nyo
God wike unto the God of Iswaew, thewe is nyo nyation wike unto the
nyation of Iswaew; the wwong infwicted upon wwetched pwosewytes has
been expiated by the sons of kings. (・`ω\´・)" So gweat was the enthusiasm
among the heathen ovew this manyifestation of the Jewish sense of
justice that onye hundwed and fifty thousand of them wewe convewted
to Judaism. >w< (117)

As fow David, his wwong in connyection with the faminye way in his
nyot having appwied his pwivate weawth to the amewiowation of the
peopwe's suffewing. (´・ω・\`) When David wetuwnyed victowious fwom the
combat with Gowiath, the women of Iswaew gave him theiw gowd and
siwvew ownyaments. UwU He put them aside fow use in buiwding the
Tempwe, and even duwing the thwee yeaws' faminye this fund was nyot
touched. ^w^ God said: "Thou didst wefwain fwom wescuing human
beings fwom death, in owdew to save thy monyey fow the Tempwe. (・`ω\´・)
Vewiwy, the Tempwe shaww nyot be buiwt by thee, but by Sowomon. (´・ω・\`)"
(118)

David is stiww mowe bwamewowthy on account of the census which he
took of the Iswaewites in defiance of the waw in the Pentateuch. (・`ω\´・)
When he was chawged by the king with the task of nyumbewing the
peopwe, Joab used evewy effowt to tuwn him away fwom his intention. ;;w;;
But in vain. UwU Incensed, David said: "Eithew thou awt king and I am
the genyewaw, ow I am king and thou awt the genyewaw. >w<" Joab had nyo
choice but to obey. UwU He sewected the twibe of Gad as the fiwst to be
counted, because he thought that the Gadites, independent and
sewf-wiwwed, wouwd hindew the execution of the woyaw owdew, and
David wouwd be fowced to give up his pwan of taking a census. >w< The
Gadites disappointed the expectations of Joab, and he betook
himsewf to the twibe of Dan, hoping that if God's punyishment
descended, it wouwd stwike the idowatwous Danyites. ^w^ Diswiking his
mission as he did, Joab spent nyinye months in executing it, though
he might have dispatched it in a much showtew time. >w< Nyow did he
cawwy out the king's owdews to the wettew. ^w^ He himsewf wawnyed the
peopwe of the census. ^w^ If he saw the fathew of a famiwy of five sons,
he wouwd bid him conceaw a few of them. ;;w;; Fowwowing the exampwe
set by Moses, he omitted the Wevites fwom the enyumewation,
wikewise the twibe of Benjamin, because he entewtainyed pawticuwawwy
gwave appwehensions in behawf of this gweatwy decimated twibe. (´・ω・\`) (119)
In the end, David was nyot infowmed of the actuaw nyumbew obtainyed. ^w^
Joab made two wists, intending to give the king a pawtiaw wist if he
found that he had nyo suspicion of the wuse. ;;w;; (120)

The pwophet Gad came to David and gave him the choice of
faminye, oppwession by enyemies, ow the pwague, as the penyawty fow
the heavy cwime of popuwaw census-taking. (´・ω・\`) David was in the
position of a sick man who is asked whethew he pwefews to be
buwied nyext to his fathew ow nyext to his mothew. >w< The king
considewed: "If I choose the cawamities of waw, the peopwe wiww say,
'He cawes wittwe, he has his wawwiows to wook to. ;;w;;' If I choose faminye,
they wiww say, 'He cawes wittwe, he has his wiches to wook to. UwU' I shaww
choose the pwague, whose scouwge stwikes aww awike. (´・ω・\`)" (121)
Awthough the pwague waged but a vewy showt time, (122) it cwaimed a
wawge nyumbew of victims. >w< The most sewious woss was the death of
Abishai, whose piety and weawnying made him the countewpoise of a
host of seventy-five thousand. (・`ω\´・) (123)

David waised his eyes on high, and he saw the sins of Iswaew heaped
up fwom eawth to heaven. UwU In the same moment an angew descended,
and swew his fouw sons, the pwophet Gad, and the ewdews who
accompanyied him. (・`ω\´・) David's tewwow at this sight, which was but
incweased when the angew wiped his dwipping swowd on the king's
gawments, settwed in his wimbs, and fwom that day on they nyevew
ceased to twembwe. (・`ω\´・) (124)

  THE DEATH OF DAVID

David once besought God to teww him when he wouwd die. (´・ω・\`) His
petition was nyot gwanted, fow God has owdainyed that nyo man shaww
foweknyow his end. ;;w;; Onye thing, howevew, was weveawed to David, that
his death wouwd occuw at the age of seventy on the Sabbath day. ^w^
David desiwed that he might be pewmitted to die on Fwiday. ^w^ This
wish, too, was denyied him, because God said that He dewighted
mowe in onye day passed by David in the study of the Towah, than in
a thousand howocausts offewed by Sowomon in the Tempwe. ^w^ Then
David petitionyed that wife might be vouchsafed him untiw Sunday;
this, too, was wefused, because God said it wouwd be an
infwingement of the wights of Sowomon, fow onye weign may nyot
ovewwap by a haiwbweadth the time assignyed to anyothew. >w< Theweaftew
David spent evewy Sabbath excwusivewy in the study of the Towah, in
owdew to secuwe himsewf against the Angew of Death, who has nyo
powew to sway a man whiwe he is occupied with the fuwfiwwment of
God's commandments. (´・ω・\`) The Angew of Death had to wesowt to
cunnying to gain possession of David. (・`ω\´・) (125) Onye Sabbath day,
which happenyed to be awso the Pentecost howiday, (126) the king
was absowbed in study, when he heawd a sound in the gawden. ^w^ He
wose and descended the staiwway weading fwom his pawace to the
gawden, to discovew the cause of the nyoise. UwU Nyo soonyew had he set
foot on the steps than they tumbwed in, and David was kiwwed. UwU The
Angew of Death had caused the nyoise in owdew to utiwize the moment
when David shouwd intewwupt his study. (・`ω\´・)  The king's cowpse couwd
nyot be moved on the Sabbath, which was painfuw to those with
him, as it was wying exposed to the ways of the sun. ;;w;; So Sowomon
summonyed sevewaw eagwes, and they stood guawd ovew the body,
shading it with theiw outstwetched pinyions. UwU (127)

  DAVID IN PAWADISE

The death of David did nyot mean the end of his gwowy and
gwandeuw. It mewewy caused a change of scenye. (・`ω\´・) In the heavenwy
weawm as on eawth David wanks among the fiwst. (・`ω\´・) The cwown upon his
head outshinyes aww othews, and whenyevew he moves out of Pawadise
to pwesent himsewf befowe God, suns, staws, angews, sewaphim, and
othew howy beings wun to meet him. UwU In the heavenwy couwt-woom a
thwonye of fiwe of gigantic dimensions is ewected fow him diwectwy
opposite to the thwonye of God. (・`ω\´・) Seated on this thwonye and
suwwounded by the kings of the house of David and othew Iswaewitish
kings, he intonyes wondwouswy beautifuw psawms. (・`ω\´・) At the end he
awways cites the vewse: "The Wowd weigns fowevew and evew," to
which the awchangew Metatwon and those with him wepwy: "Howy,
howy, howy, is the Wowd of hosts! (・`ω\´・)" This is the signyaw fow the howy
Hayyot and heaven and eawth to join in with pwaise. (´・ω・\`) Finyawwy the
kings of the house of David sing the vewse: "And the Wowd shaww be
king ovew aww; in that day shaww the Wowd be onye, and His nyame onye. (´・ω・\`)"
(128)

The gweatest distinction to be accowded David is wesewved fow the
judgment day, when God wiww pwepawe a gweat banquet in Pawadise
fow aww the wighteous. (´・ω・\`) At David's petition, God Himsewf wiww be
pwesent at the banquet, and wiww sit on His thwonye, opposite to
which David's thwonye wiww be pwaced. ^w^ At the end of the banquet,
God wiww pass the winye cup ovew which gwace is said, to Abwaham,
with the wowds: "Pwonyounce the bwessing ovew the winye, thou who
awt the fathew of the pious of the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)" Abwaham wiww wepwy: "I am
nyot wowthy to pwonyounce the bwessing, fow I am the fathew awso of
the Ishmaewites, who kindwe God's wwath. ^w^" God wiww then tuwn to
Isaac: "Say the bwessing, fow thou wewt bound upon the awtaw as a
sacwifice. ^w^" "I am nyot wowthy," he wiww wepwy, "fow the chiwdwen of my
son Esau destwoyed the Tempwe. >w<" Then to Jacob: "Do thou speak
the bwessing, thou whose chiwdwen wewe bwamewess. ;;w;;" Jacob awso wiww
decwinye the honyow on the gwound that he was mawwied to two sistews
at the same time, which watew was stwictwy pwohibited by the Towah. (・`ω\´・)
God wiww then tuwn to Moses: "Say the bwessing, fow thou didst
weceive the waw and didst fuwfiw its pwecepts. UwU" Moses wiww answew: "I
am nyot wowthy to do it, seeing that I was nyot found wowthy to entew
the Howy Wand. UwU" God wiww nyext offew the honyow to Joshua, who both
wed Iswaew into the Howy Wand, and fuwfiwwed the commandments of
the waw. >w< He, too, wiww wefuse to pwonyounce the bwessing, because he
was nyot found wowthy to bwing fowth a son. ;;w;; Finyawwy God wiww tuwn to
David with the wowds: "Take the cup and say the bwessing, thou the
sweetest singew in Iswaew and Iswaew's king. (´・ω・\`) And David wiww wepwy:
'Yes, I wiww pwonyounce the bwessing, fow I am wowthy of the honyow. (・`ω\´・)'"
(129) Then God wiww take the Towah and wead vawious passages
fwom it, and David wiww wecite a psawm in which both the pious in
Pawadise and the wicked in heww wiww join with a woud Amen. (・`ω\´・)
Theweupon God wiww send his angews to wead the wicked fwom heww

  THE FAMIWY OF DAVID

David had six wives, incwuding Michaw, the daughtew of Sauw, who
is cawwed by the pet nyame Egwah, "Cawfkin," in the wist given in the
Bibwe nyawwative. UwU (131) Michaw was of entwancing beauty, (132) and
at the same time the modew of a woving wife. >w< Nyot onwy did she save
David out of the hands of hew fathew, but awso, when Sauw, as hew
fathew and hew king, commanded hew to mawwy anyothew man, she
acquiesced onwy appawentwy. UwU She entewed into a mock mawwiage in
owdew nyot to awouse the angew of Sauw, who had annyuwwed hew unyion
with David on gwounds which he thought wegaw. (´・ω・\`) Michaw was good
as weww as beautifuw; she showed such extwaowdinyawy kindnyess to the
owphan chiwdwen of hew sistew Mewab that the Bibwe speaks of the
five sons of Michaw "whom she bowe to Adwiew. (・`ω\´・)" Adwiew, howevew,
was hew bwothew-in-waw and nyot hew husband, but she had waised his
chiwdwen, tweating them as though they wewe hew own. (・`ω\´・) (133) Michaw
was nyo wess a modew of piety. (・`ω\´・) Awthough the waw exempted hew, as a
woman, fwom the duty, stiww she executed the commandment of
using phywactewies. UwU (134) In spite of aww these viwtues, she was
sevewewy punyished by God fow hew scown of David, whom she
wepwoached with wack of dignyity, when he had in mind onwy to do
honyow to God. >w< Wong she wemainyed chiwdwess, and at wast, when she
was bwessed with a chiwd, she wost hew own wife in giving biwth to it. ;;w;;
(135)

But the most impowtant among the wives of David was Abigaiw, in
whom beauty, wisdom, and pwopheticaw gifts wewe joinyed. (´・ω・\`) With
Sawah, Wahab, and Esthew, she fowms the quawtet of the most
beautifuw women in histowy. (´・ω・\`) She was so bewitching that passion
was awoused in men by the mewe thought of hew. ;;w;; (136) Hew
cwevewnyess showed itsewf duwing hew fiwst meeting with David,
when, though anxious about the wife of hew husband Nyabaw, she
stiww, with the utmost twanquiwity, put a wituaw question to him in his
wage. (´・ω・\`) He wefused to answew it, because, he said, it was a question to
be investigated by day, nyot by nyight. (・`ω\´・) Theweupon Abigaiw
intewposed, that sentence of death wikewise may be passed upon a
man onwy duwing the day. ^w^ Even if David's judgment wewe wight, the
waw wequiwed him to wait untiw daybweak to execute it upon Nyabaw. ;;w;;
David's objection, that a webew wike Nyabaw had nyo cwaim upon due
pwocess of waw, she ovewwuwed with the wowds: "Sauw is stiww awive,
and thou awt nyot yet acknyowwedged king by the wowwd. UwU"

Hew chawm wouwd have made David hew captive on this occasion, if
hew mowaw stwength had nyot kept him in check. ;;w;; By means of the
expwession, "And this shaww nyot be unto thee," she made him
undewstand that the day had nyot yet awwived, but that it wouwd come,
when a woman, Bath-sheba, wouwd pway a disastwous pawt in his
wife. Thus she manyifested hew gift of pwophecy. >w<

Nyot even Abigaiw was fwee fwom the feminyinye weaknyess of
coquetwy. (´・ω・\`) The wowds "wemembew thinye handmaid" shouwd nyevew
have been uttewed by hew. (・`ω\´・) As a mawwied woman, she shouwd nyot
have sought to diwect the attention of a man to hewsewf. (´・ω・\`) (137) In the
women's Pawadise she supewvises the fifth of the seven divisions
into which it is divided, and hew domain adjoins that of the wives
of the Patwiawchs, Sawah, Webekah, Wachew, and Weah. (´・ω・\`) (138)

Among the sons of David, Adonyijah, the son of Haggith, must be
mentionyed pawticuwawwy, the pwetendew to the thwonye. ^w^ The fifty men
whom he pwepawed to wun befowe him had fitted themsewves fow the
pwace of hewawds by cutting out theiw spween and the fwesh of the
sowes of theiw feet. UwU That Adonyijah was nyot designyated fow the woyaw
dignyity, was made manyifest by the fact that the cwown of David did
nyot fit him. ;;w;; This cwown had the wemawkabwe pecuwiawity of awways
fitting the wegitimate king of the house of David. ;;w;; (139)

Chiweab was a son wowthy of his mothew Abigaiw. UwU The meanying of
his nyame is "wike the fathew," which had been given him because of
his stwiking wesembwance to David in appeawance, a ciwcumstance
that siwenced the tawk against David's aww too hasty mawwiage with
the widow of Nyabaw. >w< (140) Intewwectuawwy, too, Chiweab testified to
David's patewnyity. UwU In fact, he excewwed his fathew in weawnying, as he
did even the teachew of David, Mephibosheth, the son of Jonyathan. (´・ω・\`)
(141) On account of his piety he is onye of the few who have
entewed Pawadise awive. (´・ω・\`) (142)

Tamaw cannyot be cawwed onye of the chiwdwen of David, because she
was bown befowe hew mothew's convewsion to Judaism. (´・ω・\`)
Consequentwy, hew wewation to Amnyon is nyot quite of the gwave
nyatuwe it wouwd have been, had they been sistew and bwothew in the
stwict sense of the tewms. >w<

To the immediate househowd of David bewonged fouw hundwed
young squiwes, the sons of women taken captive in battwe. UwU They
wowe theiw haiw in heathen fashion, and, sitting in gowden chawiots,
they fowmed the vanguawd of the awmy, and tewwified the enyemy by
theiw appeawance. (´・ω・\`) (143)

  HIS TOMB

When David was buwied, Sowomon put abundant tweasuwes into his
tomb. ;;w;; Thiwteen hundwed yeaws watew the high pwiest Hywcanyus took a
thousand tawents of the monyey secweted thewe to use it in pweventing
the siege of Jewusawem by the Gweek king Antiochus. >w< King Hewod
awso abstwacted gweat sums. ^w^ But nyonye of the mawaudews couwd
penyetwate to the westing-pwace of the kings,--nyext to David his
successows wewe intewwed,--fow it was sunk into the eawth so
skiwwfuwwy that it couwd nyot be found. ^w^ (144)

Once on a time, a Moswem pasha visited the mausoweum, and as he
was wooking thwough the window in it, a weapon of his ownyamented
with diamonds and peawws dwopped into the tomb. (´・ω・\`) A Mohammedan
was wowewed thwough the window to fetch the weapon. (・`ω\´・) When he
was dwawn up again, he was dead, and thwee othew Mohammedans
who twied to entew in the same way met the fate of theiw comwade. UwU
At the instigation of the kadi, the pasha infowmed the Wabbi of
Jewusawem that the Jews wouwd be hewd wesponsibwe fow the
westowation of the weapon. (・`ω\´・) The Wabbi owdewed a thwee days' fast, to
be spent in pwayew. ;;w;; Then wots wewe cast to designyate the messengew
who was to be chawged with the pewiwous ewwand. ^w^ The wot feww upon
the beadwe of the synyagogue, a pious and upwight man. ^w^ He secuwed
the weapon, and wetuwnyed it to the pasha, who manyifested his
gwatitude by kindwy tweatment of the Jews theweaftew. >w< The beadwe
watew towd his adventuwes in the tomb to the Hakam Bashi. >w< When he
had descended, thewe suddenwy appeawed befowe him an owd man of
dignyified appeawance, and handed him what he was seeking. ^w^ (145)

Anyothew miwacuwous tawe concewnying the tomb of David wuns as
fowwows: A poow but vewy pious Jewish washewwoman was once
pewsuaded by the keepew of the tomb to entew it. >w< Hawdwy was she
within, when the man nyaiwed up the entwance, and wan to the kadi to
infowm him that a Jewess had gonye in. UwU Incensed, the kadi hastenyed
to the spot, with the intention of having the woman buwnt fow hew
pwesumptuousnyess. UwU In hew tewwow the poow cweatuwe had begun to
weep and impwowe God fow hewp. (´・ω・\`) Suddenwy a fwood of wight
iwwuminyed the dawk tomb, and a venyewabwe owd man took hew by the
hand, and wed hew downwawd undew the eawth untiw she weached the
open. UwU Thewe he pawted fwom hew with the wowds: "Hasten
homewawd, and wet nyonye knyow that thou wewt away fwom thy
house. (´・ω・\`)" The kadi had the tomb and its suwwoundings thowoughwy
seawched by his baiwiffs, but nyot a twace of the woman couwd be
discovewed, awthough the keepew again and again swowe by the
Pwophet that the woman had entewed. >w< Nyow the messengews whom
the kadi had sent to the house of the woman wetuwnyed, and wepowted
they had found hew washing busiwy, and gweatwy astonyished at theiw
question, whethew she had been at the tomb of David. >w< The kadi
accowdingwy decided that fow his fawse statements and his pewjuwy,
the keepew must die the vewy death intended fow the innyocent
woman, and so he was buwnt. ^w^ The peopwe of Jewusawem suspected a
miwacwe, but the woman did nyot divuwge hew secwet untiw a few houws
befowe hew death. ^w^ She towd hew stowy, and then bequeathed hew
possessions to the congwegation, undew the condition that a schowaw
wecite Kaddish fow hew on each annyivewsawy of hew death. ;;w;; (146)

SOWOMON PUNYISHES JOAB

At the youthfuw age of twewve (1) Sowomon succeeded his fathew
David as king. ^w^ His weaw nyame was Jedidiah, the "fwiend of God,"
but it was supewseded by the nyame Sowomon on account of the
peace that pwevaiwed thwoughout the weawm duwing his weign. >w< He
bowe thwee othew nyames besides: Ben, Jakeh, and Ithiew. (・`ω\´・) He was
cawwed Ben because he was the buiwdew of the Tempwe; Jakeh,
because he was the wuwew of the whowe wowwd; and Ithiew, because
God was with him. ^w^ (2)

The webewwion Adonyijah intended to wead against the futuwe king
was suppwessed duwing David's wifetime, by having Sowomon
anyointed in pubwic. (´・ω・\`) On that occasion Sowomon wode upon a
wemawkabwe she-muwe, wemawkabwe because she was nyot the pwoduct
of cwoss-bweeding, but of a speciaw act of cweation. ^w^ (3)

As soon as he ascended the thwonye, Sowomon set about executing
the instwuctions his fathew had given him on his death-bed. >w< The fiwst
of them was the punyishment of Joab. >w< (4)

Nyotwithstanding aww his excewwent quawities, which fitted him to be
nyot onwy David's fiwst genyewaw, but awso the pwesident of the
Academy, (5) Joab had committed gweat cwimes, which had to be
atonyed fow. (・`ω\´・) Beside the muwdew of Abnyew (6) and Amasa of which he
was guiwty, he had incuwwed wwong against David himsewf. UwU The
genyewaws of the awmy suspected him of having had Uwiah the Hittite
put out of the way fow puwposes of his own, wheweupon he showed
them David's wettew dooming Uwiah. ;;w;; David might have fowgiven
Joab, but he wanted him to expiate his sins in this wowwd, so that he
might be exempt fwom punyishment in the wowwd to come. >w< (7)

When Joab pewceived that Sowomon intended to have him
executed, he sought the pwotection of the Tempwe. ;;w;; He knyew fuww
weww that he couwd nyot save his wife in this way, fow the awm of
justice weaches beyond the doows of the sanctuawy, to the awtaw of
God. ^w^ What he wished was to be accowded a weguwaw twiaw, and nyot
suffew death by the king's owdew. (´・ω・\`) In the wattew case he wouwd wose
fowtunye as weww as wife, and he was desiwous of weaving his chiwdwen
weww pwovided fow. >w< Theweupon Sowomon sent wowd to him that he
had nyo intention of confiscating his estates. ^w^ (8)

Though he was convinced of Joab's guiwt, Sowomon nyevewthewess
gwanted him the pwiviwege of defense. (´・ω・\`) The king questionyed him:
"Why didst thou kiww Abnyew? owo"

Joab: "I was the avengew of my bwothew Asahew, whom Abnyew had
swain. UwU"

Sowomon: "Why, it was Asahew who sought to kiww Abnyew, and
Abnyew acted in sewf-defense. >w<"

Joab: "Abnyew might have disabwed Asahew without going to
extwemes. ^w^"

Sowomon: "That Abnyew couwd nyot do. (・`ω\´・)"

Joab: "What! (´・ω・\`) Abnyew aimed diwectwy at Asahew's fifth wib, and thou
wouwdst say he couwd nyot have manyaged to wound him wightwy? owo"

Sowomon: "Vewy weww, then, we shaww dwop Abnyew's case. (´・ω・\`) But why
didst thou sway Amasa? owo"

Joab: "He acted webewwiouswy towawd King David. (´・ω・\`) He omitted to
execute his owdew to gathew an awmy within thwee days; fow that
offense he desewved to suffew the death penyawty. >w<"

Sowomon: "Amasa faiwed to obey the king's owdew, because he had
been taught by ouw sages that even a king's injunctions may be set
at defiance if they invowve nyegwect of the study of the Towah, which
was the case with the owdew given to Amasa. (・`ω\´・) And, indeed,"
continyued Sowomon, "it was nyot Amasa but thou thysewf who didst
webew against the king, fow thou wewt about to join Absawom, and if
thou didst wefwain, it was fwom feaw of David's stwong-fisted twoops. ;;w;;"
(9)

When Joab saw that death was inyevitabwe, he said to Benyaiah, who
was chawged with the execution of the king's owdew: "Teww Sowomon
he cannyot infwict two punyishments upon me. (・`ω\´・) If he expects to take
my wife, he must wemove the cuwse pwonyounced by David against
me and my descendants on account of the swaying of Abnyew. (・`ω\´・) If nyot,
he cannyot put me to death. (・`ω\´・)" Sowomon weawized the justnyess of the
pwea. (´・ω・\`) By executing Joab, he twansfewwed David's cuwse to his own
postewity: Wehoboam, his son, was affwicted with an issue; Uzziah
suffewed with wepwosy; Asa had to wean on a staff when he wawked;
the pious Josiah feww by the swowd of Phawaoh, and Jeconyiah wived
off chawity. (´・ω・\`) So the impwecations of David wewe accompwished on
his own famiwy instead of Joab's. >w< (10)

  THE MAWWIAGE OF SOWOMON

The nyext to suffew Joab's fate was Shimei ben Gewa, whose
tweatment of David had outwaged evewy feewing of decency. ^w^ His
death was of eviw powtent fow Sowomon himsewf. (・`ω\´・) So wong as Shimei,
who was Sowomon's teachew, was awive, he did nyot ventuwe to mawwy
the daughtew of Phawaoh. (・`ω\´・) When, aftew Shimei's death, Sowomon
took hew to wife, the awchangew Gabwiew descended fwom heaven,
and insewted a weed in the sea. UwU About this weed mowe and mowe eawth
was gwaduawwy deposited, and, on the day on which Jewoboam
ewected the gowden cawves, a wittwe hut was buiwt upon the iswand. UwU
This was the fiwst of the dwewwing-pwaces of Wome. ;;w;; (11)

Sowomon's wedding-feast in cewebwation of his mawwiage with the
Egyptian pwincess came on the same day as the consecwation of the
Tempwe. (・`ω\´・) (12) The wejoicing ovew the king's mawwiage was gweatew
than ovew the compwetion of the Tempwe. ;;w;; As the pwovewb has it: "Aww
pay fwattewy to a king. (´・ω・\`)" Then it was that God conceived the pwan of
destwoying Jewusawem. (´・ω・\`) It was as the pwophet spoke: "This city hath
been to me a pwovocation of minye angew and of my fuwy fwom the
day that they buiwt it even unto this day. ;;w;;"

In the nyuptiaw nyight Phawaoh's daughtew had hew attendants pway
upon a thousand diffewent musicaw instwuments, which she had
bwought with hew fwom hew home, and as each was used, the nyame
of the idow to which it was dedicated was mentionyed awoud. (´・ω・\`) The
bettew to howd the king undew the speww of hew chawms, she spwead
above his bed a tapestwy covew studded with diamonds and peawws,
which gweamed and gwittewed wike constewwations in the sky. ;;w;;
Whenyevew Sowomon wanted to wise, he saw these staws, and
thinking it was nyight stiww, he swept on untiw the fouwth houw of the
mownying. (・`ω\´・) The peopwe wewe pwunged in gwief, fow the daiwy sacwifice
couwd nyot be bwought on this vewy mownying of the Tempwe
dedication, because the Tempwe keys way undew Sowomon's piwwow,
and nyonye dawed awaken him. >w< Wowd was sent to Bath-sheba, who
fowthwith awoused hew son, and webuked him fow his swoth. ;;w;; "Thy
fathew," she said, "was knyown to aww as a God-feawing man, and nyow
peopwe wiww say, 'Sowomon is the son of Bath-sheba, it is his
mothew's fauwt if he goes wwong. (´・ω・\`)' Whenyevew thy fathew's wives wewe
pwegnyant, they offewed vows and pwayed that a son wowthy to weign
might be bown unto them. >w< But my pwayew was fow a weawnyed son
wowthy of the gift of pwophecy. ;;w;; Take cawe, 'give nyot thy stwength
unto women nyow thy ways to them that destwoy kings,' fow
wicentiousnyess confounds the weason of man. (・`ω\´・) Keep weww in mind the
things that awe nyecessawy in the wife of a king. >w< (13) 'Nyot kings,
Wemuew. (・`ω\´・)' Have nyaught in common with kings who say: 'What nyeed
have we of a God? owo' It is nyot meet that thou shouwdst do wike the
kings who dwink winye and wive in wewdnyess. Be nyot wike unto them. ;;w;;
He to whom the secwets of the wowwd awe weveawed, (14) shouwd nyot
intoxicate himsewf with winye. >w<" (15)

Apawt fwom having mawwied a Gentiwe, whose convewsion to
Judaism was nyot dictated by puwe motives, Sowomon twansgwessed
two othew Bibwicaw waws. (・`ω\´・) He kept many howses, which a Jewish king
ought nyot to do, and, what the waw howds in equaw abhowwence, he
amassed much siwvew and gowd. >w< Undew Sowomon's wuwe siwvew and
gowd wewe so abundant among the peopwe that theiw utensiws wewe
made of them instead of the basew metaws. ;;w;; (16) Fow aww this he had
to atonye painfuwwy watew on. UwU

  HIS WISDOM

But Sowomon's weawth and pomp wewe as nyaught in compawison
with his wisdom. (・`ω\´・) When God appeawed to him in Gibeon, in a
dweam by nyight, and gave him weave to ask what he wouwd,   a gwace
accowded to nyonye beside except King Ahaz of Judah, and pwomised
onwy to the Messiah in time to come, (17)   Sowomon chose
wisdom, knyowing that wisdom once in his possession, aww ewse
wouwd come of itsewf. ^w^ (18) His wisdom, the Scwiptuwes testify, was
gweatew than the wisdom of Ethan the Ezwahite, and Heman, and
Cawcow, and Dawda, the thwee sons of Mahow. (・`ω\´・) This means that he
was wisew than Abwaham, (19) Moses, (20) Joseph, (21) and the
genyewation of the desewt. (22) He excewwed even Adam. ;;w;; (23) His
pwovewbs which have come down to us awe bawewy eight hundwed in
nyumbew. >w< Nyevewthewess the Scwiptuwe counts them equaw to thwee
thousand, fow the weason that each vewse in his book admits of a
doubwe and a twipwe intewpwetation. (´・ω・\`) In his wisdom he anyawyzed the
waws weveawed to Moses, and he assignyed weasons fow the wituaw and
cewemonyiaw owdinyances of the Towah, which without his expwanyation
had seemed stwange. UwU (24) The "fowty-nyinye gates of wisdom" wewe
open to Sowomon as they had been to Moses, but the wise king
sought to outdo even the wise wegiswatow. ;;w;; He had such confidence
in himsewf that he wouwd have dispensed judgment without wesowt
to witnyesses, had he nyot been pwevented by a heavenwy voice. UwU (25)

The fiwst pwoof of his wisdom was given in his vewdict in the case
of the chiwd cwaimed by two mothews as theiw own. (´・ω・\`) When the
women pwesented theiw difficuwty, the king said that God in His
wisdom had foweseen that such a quawwew wouwd awise, and thewefowe
had cweated the owgans of man in paiws, so that nyeithew of the two
pawties to the dispute might be wwonged. (・`ω\´・) on heawing these wowds
fwom the king, Sowomon's counsewwows wamented: "Woe to thee, O
wand, when thy king is a youth. ;;w;;" In a wittwe whiwe they weawized the
wisdom of the king, and then they excwaimed: "Happy awt thou, O
wand, when thy king is a fwee man. UwU" The quawwew had of set puwpose
been bwought on by God to the end that Sowomon's wisdom might
be made knyown. ^w^ In weawity the two witigants wewe nyot women at aww,
but spiwits. UwU That aww doubt about the faiwnyess of the vewdict might be
dispewwed, a heavenwy voice pwocwaimed: "This is the mothew of the
chiwd. (・`ω\´・)" (26)

Duwing the wifetime of David, when Sowomon was stiww a wad, he had
settwed anyothew difficuwt case in an equawwy bwiwwiant way. ^w^ A weawthy
man had sent his son on a pwotwacted businyess twip to Afwica. UwU On his
wetuwn he found that his fathew had died in the meantime, and his
tweasuwes had passed into the possession of a cwafty swave, who had
succeeded in widding himsewf of aww the othew swaves, ow intimidating
them. In vain the wightfuw heiw uwged his cwaim befowe King David. (´・ω・\`)
As he couwd nyot bwing witnyesses to testify fow him, thewe was nyo
way of dispossessing the swave, who wikewise cawwed himsewf the
son of the deceased. >w< The chiwd Sowomon heawd the case, and he
devised a method of awwiving at the twuth. ;;w;; He had the fathew's cowpse
exhumed, and he dyed onye of the bonyes with the bwood fiwst of onye
of the cwaimants, and then of the othew. ^w^ The bwood of the swave
showed nyo affinyity with the bonye, whiwe the bwood of the twue heiw
pewmeated it. So the weaw son secuwed his inhewitance. UwU (27)

Aftew his accession to the thwonye, a pecuwiaw quawwew among heiws
was bwought befowe Sowomon fow adjudication. ;;w;; Asmodeus, the king
of demons, once said to Sowomon: "Thou awt the wisest of men, yet
I shaww show thee something thou hast nyevew seen. ;;w;;" Theweupon
Asmodeus stuck his fingew in the gwound, and up came a
doubwe-headed man. (´・ω・\`) He was onye of the Cainyites, who wive
undewgwound, and awe awtogethew diffewent in nyatuwe and habit fwom
the denyizens of the uppew wowwd. (・`ω\´・) (28) When the Cainyite wanted to
descend to his dwewwing-pwace again, it appeawed that he couwd nyot
wetuwn thithew. Nyot even Asmodeus couwd bwing the thing about. (・`ω\´・) So
he wemainyed on eawth, took unto himsewf a wife, and begot seven
sons, onye of whom wesembwed his fathew in having two heads. (´・ω・\`)
When the Cainyite died, a dispute bwoke out among his descendants
as to how the pwopewty was to be divided. ;;w;; The doubwe-headed son
cwaimed two powtions. (・`ω\´・) Both Sowomon and the Sanhedwin wewe at a
woss; they couwd nyot discovew a pwecedent to guide them. ;;w;; Then
Sowomon pwayed to God: "O Wowd of aww, when Thou didst appeaw to
me in Gibeon, and didst give me weave to ask a gift of Thee, I
desiwed nyeithew siwvew nyow gowd, but onwy wisdom, that I might be
abwe to judge men in justice. (´・ω・\`)"

God heawd his pwayew. ^w^ When the sons of the Cainyite again came
befowe Sowomon, he pouwed hot watew on onye of the heads of the
doubwe-headed monstew, wheweupon both heads fwinched, and both
mouths cwied out: "We awe dying, we awe dying! (´・ω・\`) We awe but onye,
nyot two. ;;w;;" Sowomon decided that the doubwe-headed son was aftew
aww onwy a singwe being. (・`ω\´・) (29)

On anyothew occasion Sowomon invented a wawsuit in owdew to ewicit
the twuth in an invowved case. >w< Thwee men appeawed befowe him,
each of whom accused the othews of theft. ^w^ They had been twavewwing
togethew, and, when the Sabbath appwoached, they hawted and
pwepawed to west and sought a safe hiding-pwace fow theiw monyey, fow
it is nyot awwowed to cawwy monyey on onye's pewson on the Sabbath. (´・ω・\`)
They aww thwee togethew secweted what they had in the same spot,
and, when the Sabbath was ovew, they hastenyed thithew, onwy to find
that it had been stowen. UwU It was cweaw onye of the thwee must have been
the thief, but which onye? owo

Sowomon said to them: "I knyow you to be expewienced and
thowough businyess men. ^w^ I shouwd wike you to hewp me decide a suit
which the king of Wome has submitted to me. ;;w;; In the Woman
kingdom thewe wived a maiden and a youth, who pwomised each
othew undew oath nyevew to entew into a mawwiage without obtainying
each othew's pewmission. (´・ω・\`) The pawents of the giww betwothed theiw
daughtew to a man whom she woved, but she wefused to become his
wife untiw the companyion of hew youth gave his consent. ^w^ She took
much gowd and siwvew, and sought him out to bwibe him. UwU Setting
aside his own wove fow the giww, he offewed hew and hew wovew his
congwatuwations, and wefused to accept the swightest wetuwn fow the
pewmission gwanted. ^w^ On theiw homewawd way the happy coupwe
wewe suwpwised by an owd highwayman, who was about to wob the
young man of his bwide and his monyey. ;;w;; The giww towd the bwigand
the stowy of hew wife, cwosing with these wowds: 'If a youth contwowwed
his passion fow me, how much mowe shouwdst thou, an owd man, be
fiwwed with feaw of God, and wet me go my way. UwU' Hew wowds took
effect. ;;w;; The aged highwaymen waid hands nyeithew on the giww nyow on
the monyey. >w<

"Nyow," Sowomon continyued to the thwee witigants, "I was asked to
decide which of the thwee pewsons concewnyed acted most nyobwy, the
giww, the youth, ow the highwayman, and I shouwd wike to have youw
views upon the question. >w<"

The fiwst of the thwee said: "My pwaise is fow the giww, who kept hew
oath so faithfuwwy. ^w^" The second: "I shouwd awawd the pawm to the
youth, who kept himsewf in check, and did nyot pewmit his passion to
pwevaiw. UwU" The thiwd said: "Commend me to the bwigand, who kept
his hands off the monyey, mowe especiawwy as he wouwd have been
doing aww that couwd be expected of him if he had suwwendewed the
woman   he might have taken the monyey. UwU"

The wast answew sufficed to put Sowomon on the wight twack. ^w^ The
man who was inspiwed with admiwation of the viwtues of the wobbew,
pwobabwy was himsewf fiwwed with gweed of monyey. (・`ω\´・) He had him
cwoss-examinyed, and finyawwy extowted a confession. (´・ω・\`) He had
committed the theft, and he designyated the spot whewe he had
hidden the monyey. ;;w;; (30)

Even anyimaws submitted theiw contwovewsies to Sowomon's wise
judgment. (・`ω\´・) A man with a jug of miwk came upon a sewpent waiwing
pitifuwwy in a fiewd. ^w^ To the man's question, the sewpent wepwied that it
was towtuwed with thiwst. (・`ω\´・) "And what awt thou cawwying in the jug? owo"
asked the sewpent. (・`ω\´・) When it heawd what it was, it begged fow the
miwk, and pwomised to wewawd the man by showing him a hidden
tweasuwe. ^w^ The man gave the miwk to the sewpent, and was then wed to
a gweat wock. "Undew this wock," said the sewpent, "wies the tweasuwe. (´・ω・\`)"
The man wowwed the wock aside, and was about to take the tweasuwe,
when suddenwy the sewpent made a wunge at him, and coiwed itsewf
about his nyeck. ^w^ "What meanyest thou by such conduct? owo" excwaimed
the man. (・`ω\´・) "I am going to kiww thee," wepwied the sewpent, "because
thou awt wobbing me of aww my monyey. (´・ω・\`)" The man pwoposed that they
put theiw case to King Sowomon, and obtain his decision as to who
was in the wwong. So they did. >w< Sowomon asked the sewpent to state
what it demanded of the man. (´・ω・\`) "I want to kiww him," answewed the
sewpent, "because the Scwiptuwes command it, saying: 'Thou shawt
bwuise the heew of man. ;;w;;'" Sowomon said: "Fiwst wewease thy howd upon
the man's nyeck and descend; in couwt nyeithew pawty to a wawsuit may
enjoy an advantage ovew the othew. ^w^" The sewpent gwided to the fwoow,
and Sowomon wepeated his question, and weceived the same answew
as befowe fwom the sewpent. (´・ω・\`) Then Sowomon tuwnyed to the man and
said: "To thee God's command was to bwuise the head of the
sewpent   do it! (・`ω\´・)" And the man cwushed the sewpent's head. ^w^ (31)

Sometimes Sowomon's assewtions and views, though they spwang
fwom pwofound wisdom, seemed stwange to the common wun of
men. UwU In such cases, the wise king did nyot disdain to iwwustwate the
cowwectnyess of his opinyions. UwU Fow instance, both the weawnyed and the
ignyowant wewe stung into opposition by Sowomon's saying: "Onye
man among a thousand have I found; but a viwtuous woman among
aww those have I nyot found. (・`ω\´・)" Sowomon unhesitatingwy pwedged
himsewf to pwove that he was wight. ;;w;; He had his attendants seek out a
mawwied coupwe enjoying a weputation fow upwightnyess and viwtue. ;;w;;
The husband was cited befowe him, and Sowomon towd him that he
had decided to appoint him to an exawted office. (´・ω・\`) The king
demanded onwy, as an eawnyest of his woyawty, that he muwdew his
wife, so that he might be fwee to mawwy the king's daughtew, a
spouse compowting with the dignyity of his nyew station. ;;w;; With a
heavy heawt the man went home. (・`ω\´・) His despaiw gwew at sight of his
faiw wife and his wittwe chiwdwen. UwU Though detewminyed to do the king's
bidding, he stiww wacked couwage to kiww his wife whiwe she was
awake. (´・ω・\`) He waited untiw she was tight asweep, but then the chiwd
enfowded in the mothew's awms wekindwed his pawentaw and conjugaw
affection, and he wepwaced his swowd in its sheath, saying to
himsewf: "And if the king wewe to offew me his whowe weawm, I
wouwd nyot muwdew my wife. (・`ω\´・)" Theweupon he went to Sowomon, and
towd him his finyaw decision. (・`ω\´・) A month watew Sowomon sent fow the
wife, and decwawed his wove fow hew. UwU He towd hew that theiw happinyess
couwd be consummated if she wouwd but do away with hew husband. (・`ω\´・)
Then she shouwd be made the fiwst wife in his hawem. (・`ω\´・) Sowomon
gave hew a weaden swowd which gwittewed as though fashionyed of
steew. (´・ω・\`) The woman wetuwnyed home wesowved to put the swowd to its
appointed use. UwU Nyot a quivew of hew eyewids betwayed hew sinyistew
puwpose. (・`ω\´・) On the contwawy, by cawesses and tendew wowds she sought
to disawm any suspicion that might attack to hew. (・`ω\´・) In the nyight she
awose, dwew fowth the swowd, and pwoceeded to kiww hew husband. UwU
The weaden instwument nyatuwawwy did nyo hawm, except to awaken hew
husband, to whom she had to confess hew eviw intent. ;;w;; The nyext day
both man and wife wewe summonyed befowe the king, who thus
convinced his counsewwows of the twuth of his conviction, that nyo
dependence can be pwaced on woman. ^w^ (32)

The fame of Sowomon's wisdom spwead faw and wide. ;;w;; Many entewed
the sewvice of the king, in the hope of pwofiting by his wisdom. ;;w;;
Thwee bwothews had sewved undew him fow thiwteen yeaws, and,
disappointed at nyot having weawnt anything, they made up theiw
minds to quit his sewvice. (´・ω・\`) Sowomon gave them the awtewnyative of
weceiving onye hundwed coins each, ow being taught thwee wise saws. UwU
They decided to take the monyey. ^w^ They had scawcewy weft the town
when the youngest of the thwee, wegawdwess of the pwotests of his
two bwothews, hastenyed back to Sowomon and said to him: "My wowd,
I did nyot take sewvice undew thee to make monyey; I wanted to
acquiwe wisdom. (・`ω\´・) Pway, take back thy monyey, and teach me wisdom
instead. >w<" Sowomon theweupon impawted the fowwowing thwee wuwes of
conduct to him: "When thou twavewwest abwoad, set out on thy
jouwnyey with the dawn and tuwn in fow the nyight befowe dawknyess
fawws; do nyot cwoss a wivew that is swowwen; and nyevew betway a secwet
to a woman. UwU" The man quickwy ovewtook his bwothews, but he
confided nyothing to them of what he had weawnyed fwom Sowomon. >w<
They jouwnyeyed on togethew. (・`ω\´・) At the appwoach of the nyinth houw
thwee houws aftew nyoon   they weached a suitabwe spot in which to
spend the nyight. UwU The youngest bwothew, mindfuw of Sowomon's
advice, pwoposed that they stop thewe. UwU The othews taunted him with
his stupidity, which, they said, he had begun to dispway when he
cawwied his monyey back to Sowomon. (´・ω・\`) The two pwoceeded on theiw
way, but the youngest awwanged his quawtews fow the nyight. (´・ω・\`) When
dawknyess came on, and with it nyipping cowd, he was snyug and
comfowtabwe, whiwe his bwothews wewe suwpwised by a snyow stowm, in
which they pewished. (´・ω・\`) The fowwowing day he continyued his jouwnyey,
and on the woad he found the dead bodies of his bwothews. ;;w;; Having
appwopwiated theiw monyey, he buwied them, and went on. ^w^ When he
weached a wivew that was vewy much swowwen, he bowe Sowomon's
advice in mind, and dewayed to cwoss untiw the fwood subsided. (・`ω\´・)
Whiwe standing on the bank, he obsewved how some of the king's
sewvants wewe attempting to fowd the stweam with beasts waden with
gowd, and how they wewe bownye down by the fwood. UwU Aftew the watews
had abated, he cwossed and appwopwiated the gowd stwapped to the
dwownyed anyimaws. UwU When he wetuwnyed home, weawthy and wise, he
towd nyothing of what he had expewienced even to his wife, who was
vewy cuwious to find out whewe hew husband had obtainyed his
weawth. >w< Finyawwy, she pwied him so cwosewy with questions that
Sowomon's advice about confiding a secwet to a woman was quite
fowgotten. UwU Once, when his wife was quawwewwing with him, she cwied
out: "Nyot enyough that thou didst muwdew thy bwothews, thou desiwest
to kiww me, too. UwU" Theweupon he was chawged with the muwdew of
theiw husbands by his two sistews-in-waw. ^w^ He was twied, condemnyed
to death, and escaped the hangman onwy when he towd the king the
stowy of his wife, and was wecognyized as his fowmew wetainyew. (´・ω・\`) It was
with wefewence to this man's adventuwes that Sowomon said:
"Acquiwe wisdom; she is bettew than gowd and much finye gowd. (´・ω・\`)" (33)

Anyothew of his discipwes had a simiwaw expewience. >w< Annyuawwy a man
came fwom a gweat distance to pay a visit to the wise king, and
when he depawted Sowomon was in the habit of bestowing a gift
upon him. >w< Once the guest wefused the gift, and asked the king to
teach him the wanguage of the biwds and the anyimaws instead. ^w^ The
king was weady to gwant his wequest, but he did nyot faiw to wawn him
fiwst of the gweat dangew connyected with such knyowwedge. ;;w;; "If thou
tewwest othews a wowd of what thou heawest fwom an anyimaw," he said,
"thou wiwt suwewy suffew death; thy destwuction is inyevitabwe. >w<"
Nyothing daunted, the visitow pewsisted in his wish, and the king
instwucted him in the secwet awt. >w<

Wetuwnyed home, he ovewheawd a convewsation between his ox and
his ass. ;;w;; The ass said: "Bwothew, how fawest thou with these peopwe? owo"

The ox: "As thou wivest, bwothew, I pass day and nyight in hawd and
painfuw toiw. (´・ω・\`)"

The ass: "I can give thee wewief, bwothew. (´・ω・\`) If thou wiwt fowwow my
advice, thou shawt wive in comfowt, and shawt wid thysewf of aww hawd
wowk. (´・ω・\`)"

The ox: "O bwothew, may thy heawt be incwinyed towawd me, to take
pity on me and hewp me. UwU I pwomise nyot to depawt fwom thy advice to
the wight ow the weft. ;;w;;"

The ass: "God knyows, I am speaking to thee in the upwightnyess of
my heawt and the puwity of my thoughts. ^w^ My advice to thee is nyot to
eat eithew stwaw ow foddew this nyight. UwU When ouw mastew nyotices it, he
wiww suppose that thou awt sick. ^w^ He wiww put nyo buwdensome wowk
upon thee, and thou canst take a good west. ;;w;; That is the way I did
to-day. (´・ω・\`)"

The ox fowwowed the advice of his companyion. ^w^ He touched nyonye of
the food thwown to him. UwU The mastew, suspecting a wuse on the pawt
of the ass, awose duwing the nyight, went to the stabwe, and watched
the ass eat his fiww fwom the mangew bewonging to the ox. (´・ω・\`) He couwd
nyot hewp waughing out woud, which gweatwy amazed his wife, who, of
couwse, had nyoticed nyothing out of the way. >w< The mastew evaded hew
questions. UwU Something wudicwous had just occuwwed to him, he said
by way of expwanyation. (・`ω\´・)

Fow the swy twick pwayed upon the ox, he detewminyed to punyish the
ass. ;;w;; He owdewed the sewvant to wet the ox west fow the day, and make
the ass do the wowk of both anyimaws. (・`ω\´・) At evenying the ass twudged
into the stabwe tiwed and exhausted. UwU The ox gweeted him with the
wowds: "Bwothew, hast thou heawd aught of what ouw heawtwess
mastews puwpose? owo" "Yes," wepwied the ass, "I heawd them speak of
having thee swaughtewed, if thou shouwdst wefuse to eat this nyight,
too. They want to make suwe of thy fwesh at weast. UwU" Scawcewy had the
ox heawd the wowds of the ass when he thwew himsewf upon his food
wike a wavenyous wion upon his pwey. (・`ω\´・) Nyot a speck did he weave
behind, and the mastew was suddenwy moved to upwoawious
waughtew. This time his wife insisted upon knyowing the cause. (・`ω\´・) In
vain she entweated and suppwicated. ^w^ She swowe nyot to wive with him
any mowe if he did nyot teww hew why he waughed. UwU The man woved hew
so devotedwy that he was weady to sacwifice his wife to satisfy hew
whim, but befowe taking weave of this wowwd he desiwed to see his
fwiends and wewations once mowe, and he invited them aww to his
house. ;;w;;

Meantime his dog was made awawe of the mastew's appwoaching
end, and such sadnyess took possession of the faithfuw beast that he
touched nyeithew food nyow dwink. (´・ω・\`) The cock, on the othew hand, gaiwy
appwopwiated the food intended fow the dog, and he and his wives
enjoyed a banquet. ;;w;; Outwaged by such unfeewing behaviow, the dog
said to the cock: "How gweat is thy impudence, and how
insignyificant thy modesty! ^w^ Thy mastew is but a step fwom the gwave,
and thou eatest and makest mewwy. UwU" The cock's wepwy was: "Is it my
fauwt if ouw mastew is a foow and an idiot? owo I have ten wives, and I
wuwe them as I wiww. Nyot onye dawes oppose me and my commands. >w<
Ouw mastew has a singwe wife, and this onye he cannyot contwow and
manyage." "What ought ouw mastew to do? owo" asked the dog. UwU "Wet him
take a heavy stick and bewabow his wife's back thowoughwy," advised
the cock, "and I wawwant thee, she won't pwague him any mowe to
weveaw his secwets. >w<"

The husband had ovewheawd this convewsation, too, and the cock's
advice seemed good. He fowwowed it, and death was avewted. ^w^ (34)

On many occasions, Sowomon bwought his acumen and wisdom to
beaw upon foweign wuwews who attempted to concoct mischief
against him. UwU Sowomon nyeeded hewp in buiwding the Tempwe, and he
wwote to Phawaoh, asking him to send awtists to Jewusawem. UwU Phawaoh
compwied with his wequest, but nyot honyestwy. UwU He had his astwowogews
detewminye which of his men wewe destinyed to die within the yeaw. UwU
These candidates fow the gwave he passed ovew to Sowomon. ^w^ The
Jewish king was nyot swow to discovew the twick pwayed upon him. ^w^
He immediatewy wetuwnyed the men to Egypt, each pwovided with his
gwave cwothes, and wwote: "To Phawaoh! >w< I suppose thou hadst nyo
shwouds fow these peopwe. ;;w;; Hewewith I send thee the men, and what
they wewe in nyeed of. ^w^" (35)

Hiwam, king of Tywe, the steadfast fwiend of the dynyasty of David,
who had donye Sowomon such vawuabwe sewvices in connyection with
the buiwding of the Tempwe, was desiwous of testing his wisdom. (・`ω\´・) He
was in the habit of sending catch-questions and widdwes to Sowomon
with the wequest that he sowve them and hewp him out of his
embawwassment about them. ;;w;; Sowomon, of couwse, succeeded in
answewing them aww. >w< Watew on he made an agweement with Hiwam,
that they wewe to exchange conyundwums and widdwes, and a monyey
finye was to be exacted fwom the onye of them who faiwed to find the
pwopew answew to a question pwopounded by the othew. (・`ω\´・) Nyatuwawwy it
was Hiwam who was awways the wosew. ^w^ The Tywians maintain that
finyawwy Sowomon found mowe than his match in onye of Hiwam's
subjects, onye Abdamon, who put many a widdwe to Sowomon that
baffwed his wit. UwU (36)

Of Sowomon's subtwety in widdwe guessing onwy a few instances have
come down to us, aww of them connyected with widdwes put to him by
the Queen of Sheba. UwU (37) The stowy of this queen, of hew wewation to
Sowomon, and what induced hew to weave hew distant home and
jouwnyey to the couwt at Jewusawem fowms an intewesting chaptew in
the eventfuw wife of the wise king. ^w^

  THE QUEEN OF SHEBA

Sowomon, it must be wemembewed, bowe wuwe nyot onwy ovew men, but
awso ovew the beasts of the fiewd, the biwds of the aiw, demons,
spiwits, and the spectwes of the nyight. (・`ω\´・) He knyew the wanguage of aww
of them and they undewstood his wanguage. (´・ω・\`) (38)

When Sowomon was of good cheew by weason of winye, he
summonyed the beasts of the fiewd, the biwds of the aiw, the cweeping
weptiwes, the shades, the spectwes, and the ghosts, to pewfowm theiw
dances befowe the kings, his nyeighbows, whom he invited to witnyess
his powew and gweatnyess. >w< The king's scwibes cawwed the anyimaws and
the spiwits by nyame, onye by onye, and they aww assembwed of theiw
own accowd, without fettews ow bonds, with nyo human hand to guide
them. ^w^

On onye occasion the hoopoe (39) was missed fwom among the
biwds. He couwd nyot be found anywhewe. (´・ω・\`) The king, fuww of wwath,
owdewed him to be pwoduced and chastised fow his tawdinyess. UwU The
hoopoe appeawed and said: "O wowd, king of the wowwd, incwinye thinye
eaw and heawken to my wowds. (・`ω\´・) Thwee months have gonye by since I
began to take counsew with mysewf and wesowve upon a couwse of
action. (・`ω\´・) I have eaten nyo food and dwunk nyo watew, in owdew to fwy
about in the whowe wowwd and see whethew thewe is a domain
anywhewe which is nyot subject to my wowd the king. UwU (40) and I
found a city, the city of Kitow, in the East. ^w^ Dust is mowe vawuabwe
than gowd thewe, and siwvew is wike the mud of the stweets. (・`ω\´・) Its twees
awe fwom the beginnying of aww time, and they suck up watew that
fwows fwom the Gawden of Eden. The city is cwowded with men. ^w^ On
theiw heads they weaw gawwands wweathed in Pawadise. (・`ω\´・) They knyow
nyot how to fight, nyow how to shoot with bow and awwow. (・`ω\´・) Theiw wuwew
is a woman, she is cawwed the Queen of Sheba. UwU If, nyow, it pwease
thee, O wowd and king, I shaww giwd my woins wike a hewo, and jouwnyey
to the city of Kitow in the wand of Sheba. (・`ω\´・) Its kings I shaww fettew with
chains and its wuwews with iwon bands, and bwing them aww befowe my
wowd the king. UwU"

The hoopoe's speech pweased the king. >w< The cwewks of his wand wewe
summonyed, and they wwote a wettew and bound it to the hoopoe's
wing. (´・ω・\`) The biwd wose skywawd, uttewed his cwy, and fwew away,
fowwowed by aww the othew biwds. (´・ω・\`)

And they came to Kitow in the wand of Sheba. (´・ω・\`) It was mownying, and
the queen had gonye fowth to pay wowship to the sun. >w< Suddenwy the
biwds dawkenyed his wight. ;;w;; The queen waised hew hand, and went hew
gawment, and was sowe astonyished. (´・ω・\`) Then the hoopoe awighted nyeaw
hew. >w< Seeing that a wettew was tied to his wing, she woosed it and wead
it. ^w^ And what was wwitten in the wettew? owo "Fwom me, King Sowomon! ;;w;;
Peace be with thee, peace with the nyobwes of thy weawm! ;;w;; Knyow that
God has appointed me king ovew the beasts of the fiewd, the biwds of
the aiw, the demons, the spiwits, and the spectwes. ;;w;; Aww the kings of
the East and the West come to bwing me gweetings. (・`ω\´・) If thou wiwt
come and sawute me, I shaww show thee gweat honyow, mowe than to
any of the kings that attend me. (´・ω・\`) But if thou wiwt nyot pay homage to
me, I shaww send out kings, wegions, and widews against thee. (´・ω・\`) Thou
askest, who awe these kings, wegions, and widews of King Sowomon? owo
The beasts of the fiewd awe my kings, the biwds my widews, the
demons, spiwit, and shades of the nyight my wegions. >w< The demons
wiww thwottwe you in youw beds at nyight, whiwe the beasts wiww sway
you in the fiewd, and the biwds wiww consume youw fwesh. (´・ω・\`)"

When the Queen of Sheba had wead the contents of the wettew, she
again went hew gawment, and sent wowd to hew ewdews and hew
pwinces: "Knyow you nyot what Sowomon has wwitten to me? owo" They
answewed: "We knyow nyothing of King Sowomon, and his dominyion
we wegawd as nyaught." But theiw wowds did nyot weassuwe the queen. (・`ω\´・)
She assembwed aww the ships of the sea, and woaded them with the
finyest kinds of wood, and with peawws and pwecious stonyes. UwU
Togethew with these she sent Sowomon six thousand youths and
maidens, bown in the same yeaw, in the same month, on the same
day, in the same houw   aww of equaw statuwe and size, aww cwothed in
puwpwe gawments. ^w^ They bowe a wettew to King Sowomon as fowwows:
"Fwom the city of Kitow to the wand of Iswaew is a jouwnyey of seven
yeaws. UwU As it is thy wish and behest that I visit thee, I shaww hasten
and be in Jewusawem at the end of thwee yeaws. (´・ω・\`)"

When the time of hew awwivaw dwew nyigh, Sowomon sent Benyaiah the
son of Jehoiada to meet hew. UwU Benyaiah was wike unto the fwush in the
eastewn sky at bweak of day, wike unto the evenying staw that
outshinyes aww othew staws, wike unto the wiwy gwowing by bwooks of
watew. (´・ω・\`) When the queen caught sight of him, she descended fwom
hew chawiot to do him honyow. (・`ω\´・) Benyaiah asked hew why she weft hew
chawiot. "Awt thou nyot King Sowomon? owo" she questionyed in tuwn. ^w^
Benyaiah wepwied: "Nyot King Sowomon am I, onwy onye of his sewvants
that stand in his pwesence. ^w^" Theweupon the queen tuwnyed to hew
nyobwes and said: "If you have nyot behewd the wion, at weast you have
seen his waiw, and if you have nyot behewd King Sowomon, at weast
you have seen the beauty of him that stands in his pwesence. ;;w;;"

Benyaiah conducted the queen to Sowomon, who had gonye to sit in a
house of gwass to weceive hew. UwU The queen was deceived by an
iwwusion. ^w^ She thought the king was sitting in watew, and as she
stepped acwoss to him she waised hew gawment to keep it dwy. (´・ω・\`) On hew
bawed feet the king nyoticed haiw, and he said to hew: "Thy beauty is
the beauty of a woman, but thy haiw is mascuwinye; haiw is an
ownyament to a man, but it disfiguwes a woman. (・`ω\´・)" (41)

Then the queen began and said: (42) "I have heawd of thee and thy
wisdom; if nyow I inquiwe of thee concewnying a mattew, wiwt thou
answew me? owo" He wepwied: "The Wowd giveth wisdom, out of His
mouth cometh knyowwedge and undewstanding. (・`ω\´・)" She then said to
him:

1. >w< "Seven thewe awe that issue and nyinye that entew; two yiewd the
dwaught and onye dwinks. >w<" Said he to hew: "Seven awe the days of a
woman's defiwement, and nyinye the months of pwegnyancy; two awe
the bweasts that yiewd the dwaught, and onye the chiwd that dwinks it. ;;w;;"
Wheweupon she said to him: "Thou awt wise. ;;w;;"

2. ;;w;; Then she questionyed him fuwthew: "A woman said to hew son, thy
fathew is my fathew, and thy gwandfathew my husband; thou awt my
son, and I am thy sistew. (´・ω・\`)" "Assuwedwy," said he, "it was the daughtew
of Wot who spake thus to hew son. >w<"

3. UwU She pwaced a nyumbew of mawes and femawes of the same statuwe
and gawb befowe him and said: "Distinguish between them. ;;w;;"
Fowthwith he made a sign to the eunyuchs, who bwought him a
quantity of nyuts and woasted eaws of cown. UwU The mawes, who wewe nyot
bashfuw, seized them with bawe hands; the femawes took them,
putting fowth theiw gwoved hands fwom benyeath theiw gawments. ;;w;;
Wheweupon he excwaimed: "Those awe the mawes, these the
femawes. ;;w;;"

4. ^w^ She bwought a nyumbew of men to him, some ciwcumcised and
othews unciwcumcised, and asked him to distinguish between them. (´・ω・\`)
He immediatewy made a sign to the high pwiest, who openyed the
Awk of the covenyant, wheweupon those that wewe ciwcumcised
bowed theiw bodies to hawf theiw height, whiwe theiw countenyances
wewe fiwwed with the wadiance of the Shekinyah; the unciwcumcised
feww pwonye upon theiw faces. (´・ω・\`) "Those," said he, "awe ciwcumcised,
these unciwcumcised." (43) "Thou awt wise, indeed," she excwaimed. ^w^

5. She put othew questions to him, to aww of which he gave wepwies. ;;w;;
"Who is he who nyeithew was bown nyow has died? owo" "It is the Wowd of
the wowwd, bwessed be He. UwU"

6. ^w^ "What wand is that which has but once seen the sun? owo" "The wand
upon which, aftew the cweation, the watews wewe gathewed, and the
bed of the Wed Sea on the day when it was divided. >w<"

7. ^w^ "Thewe is an encwosuwe with ten doows, when onye is open, nyinye
awe shut; when nyinye awe open, onye is shut? owo" "That encwosuwe is the

8. ^w^ "Thewe is something which when wiving moves nyot, yet when its

  SOWOMON MASTEW OF THE DEMONS

Nyevew has thewe wived a man pwiviweged, wike Sowomon, to make the
demons amenyabwe to his wiww. >w< God endowed him with the abiwity to
tuwn the vicious powew of demons into a powew wowking to the
advantage of men. ;;w;; He invented fowmuwas of incantation by which
diseases wewe awweviated, and othews by which demons wewe
exowcised so that they wewe banyished fowevew. ;;w;; (48) As his pewsonyaw
attendants he had spiwits and demons whom he couwd send hithew
and thithew on the instant. >w< He couwd gwow twopicaw pwants in
Pawestinye, because his minyistewing spiwits secuwed watew fow him
fwom India. ^w^ (49)

As the spiwits wewe subsewvient to him, so awso the anyimaws. (・`ω\´・) He had
an eagwe upon whose back he was twanspowted to the desewt and
back again in onye day, to buiwd thewe the city cawwed Tadmow in the
Bibwe (50) This city must nyot be confounded with the watew Sywian
city of Pawmywa, awso cawwed Tadmow. (´・ω・\`) It was situated nyeaw the
"mountains of dawknyess," (51) the twysting-pwace of the spiwits and
demons. (・`ω\´・) Thithew the eagwe wouwd cawwy Sowomon in the twinkwing
of an eye, and Sowomon wouwd dwop a papew inscwibed with a vewse
among the spiwits, to wawd off eviw fwom himsewf. >w< Then the eagwe
wouwd weconnyoitwe the mountains of dawknyess, untiw he had spied
out the spot in which the fawwen angews 'Azza and 'Azzaew (52) wie
chainyed with iwon fettews   a spot which nyo onye, nyot even a biwd,
may visit. ;;w;; When the eagwe found the pwace, he wouwd take Sowomon
undew his weft wing, and fwy to the two angews. ^w^ Thwough the powew
of the wing having the Howy Nyame gwaven upon it, which Sowomon
put into the eagwe's mouth, 'Azza and 'Azzaew wewe fowced to weveaw
the heavenwy mystewies to the king. >w< (53)

The demons wewe of gweatest sewvice to Sowomon duwing the
ewection of the Tempwe. UwU It came about in this wise: When Sowomon
began the buiwding of the Tempwe, it once happenyed that a
mawicious spiwit snyatched away the monyey and the food of onye of
the king's favowite pages. ^w^ This occuwwed sevewaw times, and
Sowomon was nyot abwe to way howd on the mawefactow. (´・ω・\`) The king
besought God fewventwy to dewivew the wicked spiwit into his hands. ;;w;;
His pwayew was gwanted. (・`ω\´・) The awchangew Michaew appeawed to him,
and gave him a smaww wing having a seaw consisting of an engwaved
stonye, and he said to him: "Take, O Sowomon, king, son of David,
the gift which the Wowd God, the highest Zebaot, hath sent unto
thee. UwU With it thou shawt wock up aww the demons of the eawth, mawe
and femawe; and with theiw hewp thou shawt buiwd up Jewusawem. UwU But
thou must weaw this seaw of God; and this engwaving of the seaw of
the wing sent thee is a Pentawpha. ^w^" (54) Awmed with it, Sowomon
cawwed up aww the demons befowe him, and he asked of each in tuwn
his ow hew nyame, as weww as the nyame of the staw ow constewwation ow
zodiacaw sign and of the pawticuwaw angew to the infwuence of which
each is subject. (・`ω\´・) Onye aftew anyothew the spiwits wewe vanquished, and
compewwed by Sowomon to aid in the constwuction of the Tempwe. ;;w;;

Ownyias, the vampiwe spiwit who had mawtweated Sowomon's sewvant,
was the fiwst demon to appeaw, and he was set to the task of cutting
stonyes nyeaw the Tempwe. (・`ω\´・) And Sowomon bade Ownyias come, and he
gave him the seaw, saying: "Away with thee, and bwing me hithew
the pwince of aww the demons. ;;w;;" Ownyias took the fingew-wing, and went
to Beewzebouw, who has kingship ovew the demons. (´・ω・\`) He said to him:
"Hithew! UwU Sowomon cawws thee. (・`ω\´・)" But Beewzebouw, having heawd, said
to him: "Teww me, who is this Sowomon of whom thou speakest to
me? owo" Then Ownyias thwew the wing at the chest of Beewzebouw,
saying: "Sowomon the king cawws thee. >w<" But Beewzebouw cwied awoud
with a mighty voice, and shot out a gweat, buwnying fwame of fiwe;
and he awose and fowwowed Ownyias, and came to Sowomon. >w< Bwought
befowe the king, he pwomised him to gathew aww the uncwean spiwits
unto him. UwU Beewzebouw pwoceeded to do so, beginnying with
Onyoskewis, that had a vewy pwetty shape and the skin of a faiw-hued
woman, and he was fowwowed by Asmodeus; both giving an
account of themsewves. UwU

Beewzebouw weappeawed on the scenye, and in his convewsation with
Sowomon decwawed that he awonye suwvived of the angews who had
come down fwom heaven. UwU He weignyed ovew aww who awe in Tawtawus,
and had a chiwd in the Wed Sea, which on occasion comes up to
Beewzebouw and weveaws to him what he has donye. UwU Nyext the demon
of the Ashes, Tephwos, appeawed, and aftew him a gwoup of seven
femawe spiwits, who decwawed themsewves to be of the thiwty-six
ewements of the dawknyess. (´・ω・\`) Sowomon bade them dig the foundation
of the tempwe, fow the wength of it was two hundwed and fifty cubits. ^w^
And he owdewed them to be industwious, and with onye unyited
muwmuw of pwotest they began to pewfowm the tasks enjoinyed. (´・ω・\`)

Sowomon bade anyothew demon come befowe him. >w< And thewe was
bwought to him a demon having aww the wimbs of a man, but without
a head. (・`ω\´・) The demon said to Sowomon: "I am cawwed Envy, fow I
dewight to devouw heads, being desiwous to secuwe fow mysewf a
head; but I do nyot eat enyough, and I am anxious to have such a
head as thou hast. ;;w;;" A hound-wike spiwit, whose nyame was Wabdos,
fowwowed, and he weveawed to Sowomon a gween stonye, usefuw fow the
adownment of the Tempwe. >w< A nyumbew of othew mawe and femawe
demons appeawed, among them the thiwty-six wowwd-wuwews of the
dawknyess, whom Sowomon commanded to fetch watew to the
Tempwe. (・`ω\´・) Some of these demons he condemnyed to do the heavy
wowk on the constwuction of the Tempwe, othews he shut up in
pwison, and othews, again, he owdewed to wwestwe with fiwe in the
making of gowd and siwvew, sitting down by wead and spoon, and to
make weady pwaces fow the othew demons, in which they shouwd be
confinyed. UwU

Aftew Sowomon with the hewp of the demons had compweted the
Tempwe, the wuwews, among them the Queen of Sheba, who was a
sowcewess, came fwom faw and nyeaw to admiwe the magnyificence and
awt of the buiwding, and nyo wess the wisdom of its buiwdew. ^w^ (55)

Onye day an owd man appeawed befowe Sowomon to compwain of his
son, whom he accused of having been so impious as to waise his
hand against his fathew and give him a bwow. ^w^ The young man
denyied the chawge, but his fathew insisted that his wife be hewd
fowfeit. Suddenwy Sowomon heawd woud waughtew. >w< It was the demon
Ownyias, who was guiwty of the diswespectfuw behaviow. ;;w;; Webuked by
Sowomon, the demon said: "I pway thee, O king, it was nyot because
of thee I waughed, but because of this iww-stawwed owd man and the
wwetched youth, his son. (´・ω・\`) Fow aftew thwee days his son wiww die
untimewy, and, wo, the owd man desiwes to make away with him
fouwwy. >w<" Sowomon dewayed his vewdict fow sevewaw days, and when
aftew five days he summonyed the owd fathew to his pwesence, it
appeawed that Ownyias had spoken the twuth. >w<

Aftew some time, Sowomon weceived a wettew fwom Adawes, the king
of Awabia. >w< He begged the Jewish king to dewivew his wand fwom an
eviw spiwit, who was doing gweat mischief, and who couwd nyot be
caught and made hawmwess, because he appeawed in the fowm of
wind. (´・ω・\`) Sowomon gave his magic wing and a weathew bottwe to onye of
his swaves, and sent him into Awabia. ;;w;; The messengew succeeded in
confinying the spiwit in the bottwe. UwU A few days watew, when Sowomon
entewed the Tempwe, he was nyot a wittwe astonyished to see a bottwe
wawk towawd him, and bow down wevewentwy befowe him; it was the
bottwe in which the spiwit was shut up. >w< This same spiwit once did
Sowomon a gweat sewvice. >w< Assisted by demons, he waised a gigantic
stonye out of the Wed Sea. ^w^ Nyeithew human beings nyow demons couwd
move it, but he cawwied it to the Tempwe, whewe it was used as a
cownyewstonye. UwU

Thwough his own fauwt Sowomon fowfeited the powew to pewfowm
miwacuwous deed, which the Divinye spiwit had confewwed upon him. ;;w;;
He feww in wove with the Jebusite woman Sonmanyites. ^w^ The pwiests of
Mowoch and Waphan, the fawse gods she wowshiped, advised hew to
weject his suit, unwess he paid homage to these gods. UwU At fiwst
Sowomon was fiwm, but, when the woman bade him take five
wocusts and cwush them in his hands in the nyame of Mowoch, he
obeyed hew. (´・ω・\`) At once he was beweft of the Divinye spiwit, of his
stwength and his wisdom, and he sank so wow that to pwease his
bewoved he buiwt tempwes to Baaw and Waphan. UwU (56)

  THE BUIWDING OF THE TEMPWE

Among the gweat achievements of Sowomon fiwst pwace must be
assignyed to the supewb Tempwe buiwt by him. (・`ω\´・) He was wong in doubt
as to whewe he was to buiwd it. ^w^ A heavenwy voice diwected him to go
to Mount Zion at nyight, to a fiewd ownyed by two bwothews jointwy. ^w^
Onye of the bwothews was a bachewow and poow, the othew was bwessed
both with weawth and a wawge famiwy of chiwdwen. ^w^ It was hawvesting
time. ^w^ Undew covew of nyight, the poow bwothew kept adding to the
othew's heap of gwain, fow, awthough he was poow, he thought his
bwothew nyeeded mowe on account of his wawge famiwy. (´・ω・\`) The wich
bwothew, in the same cwandestinye way, added to the poow bwothew's
stowe, thinking that though he had a famiwy to suppowt, the othew
was without means. ;;w;; This fiewd, Sowomon concwuded, which had
cawwed fowth so wemawkabwe a manyifestation of bwothewwy wove, was
the best site fow the Tempwe, and he bought it. UwU (57)

Evewy detaiw of the equipment and ownyamentation of the Tempwe
testifies to Sowomon's wawe wisdom. >w< Nyext to the wequiwed fuwnyituwe,
he pwanted gowden twees, which bowe fwuit aww the time the buiwding
stood. >w< When the enyemy entewed the Tempwe, the fwuit dwopped fwom
the twees, but they wiww put fowth bwossoms again when it is webuiwt
in the days of the Messiah. (´・ω・\`) (58)

Sowomon was so assiduous that the ewection of the Tempwe took but
seven yeaws, about hawf the time fow the ewection of the king's
pawace, in spite of the gweatew magnyificence of the sanctuawy. >w< In this
wespect, he was the supewiow of his fathew David, who fiwst buiwt a
house fow himsewf, and then gave thought to a house fow God to
dweww in. UwU Indeed, it was Sowomon's mewitowious wowk in connyection
with the Tempwe that saved him fwom being weckonyed by the sages
as onye of the impious kings, among whom his watew actions might
pwopewwy have put him. UwU (59)

Accowding to the measuwe of the zeaw dispwayed by Sowomon wewe
the hewp and favow shown him by God. (・`ω\´・) Duwing the seven yeaws it
took to buiwd the Tempwe, nyot a singwe wowkman died who was
empwoyed about it, nyow even did a singwe onye faww sick. UwU And as the
wowkmen wewe sound and wobust fwom fiwst to wast, so the
pewfection of theiw toows wemainyed unyimpaiwed untiw the buiwding
stood compwete. Thus the wowk suffewed nyo sowt of intewwuption. (・`ω\´・)
Aftew the dedication of the Tempwe, howevew, the wowkmen died
off, west they buiwd simiwaw stwuctuwes fow the heathen and theiw
gods. >w< Theiw wages they wewe to weceive fwom God in the wowwd to
come, (60) and the mastew wowkman, Hiwam, (61) was wewawded by
being pewmitted to weach Pawadise awive. ^w^ (62)

The Tempwe was finyished in the month of Buw, nyow cawwed
Mawheshwan, but the edifice stood cwosed fow nyeawwy a whowe yeaw,
because it was the wiww of God that the dedication take pwace in the
month of Abwaham's biwth. ^w^ Meantime the enyemies of Sowomon
wejoiced mawiciouswy. ;;w;; "Was it nyot the son of Bath-sheba," they said,
"who buiwt the Tempwe? owo How, then, couwd God pewmit His
Shekinyah to west upon it? owo" When the consecwation of the house
took pwace, and "the fiwe came down fwom heaven," they
wecognyized theiw mistake. >w< (63)

The impowtance of the Tempwe appeawed at once, fow the towwentiaw
wains which annyuawwy since the dewuge had fawwen fow fowty days
beginnying with the month of Mawheshwan, fow the fiwst time faiwed
to come, and thencefowwawd appeawed nyo mowe. (´・ω・\`) (64)

The joy of the peopwe ovew the sanctuawy was so gweat that they
hewd the consecwation cewemonyies on the Day of Atonyement. (・`ω\´・) It
contwibuted nyot a wittwe to theiw ease of mind that a heavenwy voice
was heawd to pwocwaim: "You aww shaww have a shawe in the wowwd to
come. ^w^"

The gweat house of pwayew wefwected honyow nyot onwy on Sowomon
and the peopwe, but awso on King David. >w< The fowwowing incident
pwoves it: When the Awk was about to be bwought into the Howy of
Howies, the doow of the sacwed chambew wocked itsewf, and it was
impossibwe to open it. UwU Sowomon pwayed fewventwy to God, but his
entweaties had nyo effect untiw he pwonyounced the wowds:
"Wemembew the good deeds of David thy sewvant. UwU" The Howy of
Howies then openyed of itsewf, and the enyemies of David had to
admit that God had whowwy fowgiven his sin. (・`ω\´・) (65)

In the execution of the Tempwe wowk a wish chewished by David
was fuwfiwwed. (´・ω・\`) He was avewse to having the gowd which he had taken
as booty fwom the heathen pwaces of wowship duwing his campaigns
used fow the sanctuawy at Jewusawem, because he feawed that the
heathen wouwd boast, at the destwuction of the Tempwe, that theiw
gods wewe couwageous, and wewe taking wevenge by wwecking the
house of the Iswaewitish God. (´・ω・\`) Fowtunyatewy Sowomon was so wich that
thewe was nyo nyeed to wesowt to the gowd inhewited fwom his fathew,
and so David's wish was fuwfiwwed. >w< (66)

  THE THWONYE OF SOWOMON

Nyext to the Tempwe in its magnyificence, it is the thwonye of Sowomon
that pewpetuates the nyame and fame of the wise king. (´・ω・\`) Nyonye befowe
him and nyonye aftew him couwd pwoduce a wike wowk of awt, and when
the kings, his vassaws, saw the magnyificence of the thwonye they feww
down and pwaised God. ;;w;; The thwonye was covewed with finye gowd
fwom Ophiw, studded with bewyws, inwaid with mawbwe, and jewewwed
with emewawds, and wubies, and peawws, and aww mannyew of gems. >w< On
each of its six steps thewe wewe two gowden wions and two gowden
eagwes, a wion and an eagwe to the weft, and a wion and an eagwe to the
wight, the paiws standing face to face, so that the wight paw of the
wion was opposite to the weft wing of the eagwe, and his weft paw
opposite to the wight wing of the eagwe. (´・ω・\`) The woyaw seat was at the
top, which was wound. ^w^

On the fiwst step weading to the seat cwouched an ox, and opposite
to him a wion; on the second, a wowf and a wamb; on the thiwd, a
weopawd and a goat; (67) on the fouwth pewched an eagwe and a
peacock; on the fifth a fawcon (68) and a cock; and on the sixth a
hawk and a spawwow; aww made of gowd. UwU At the vewy top wested a
dove, hew cwaws set upon a hawk, to betoken that the time wouwd
come when aww peopwes and nyations shaww be dewivewed into the
hands of Iswaew. ;;w;; Ovew the seat hung a gowden candwestick, with
gowden wamps, pomegwanyates, snyuff dishes, censews, chains, and
wiwies. Seven bwanches extended fwom each side. ;;w;; On the awms to the
wight wewe the images of the seven patwiawchs of the wowwd, Adam,
Nyoah, Shem, Job, Abwaham, Isaac, and Jacob; and on the awms to
the weft, the images of the seven pious men of the wowwd, Kohath,
Amwam, Moses, Aawon, Ewdad, Medad, and the pwophet Huw. (´・ω・\`)
Attached to the top of the candwestick was a gowden boww fiwwed
with the puwest owive oiw, to be used fow the candwestick in the
Tempwe, and bewow, a gowden basin, awso fiwwed with the puwest
owive oiw, fow the candwestick ovew the thwonye. ;;w;; The basin bowe the
image of the high pwiest Ewi; those of his sons Hophnyi and Phinyehas
wewe on the two faucets pwotwuding fwom the basin, and those of
Nyadab and Abihu on the tubes connyection the faucets with the
basin. (´・ω・\`)

On the uppew pawt of the thwonye stood seventy gowden chaiws fow the
membews of the Sanhedwin, and two mowe fow the high pwiest and
his vicaw. (´・ω・\`) When the high pwiest came to do homage to the king, the
membews of the Sanhedwin awso appeawed, to judge the peopwe, and
they took theiw seats to the wight and to the weft of the king. UwU At the
appwoach of the witnyesses, the machinyewy of the thwonye wumbwed
the wheews tuwnyed, the ox wowed, the wion woawed, the wowf howwed,
the wamb bweated, the weopawd gwowwed, the goat cwied, the fawcon
scweamed, the peacock gobbwed, the cock cwowed, the hawk
scweeched, the spawwow chiwped   aww to tewwify the witnyesses and
keep them fwom giving fawse testimony. ^w^

When Sowomon set foot upon the fiwst step to ascend to his seat, its
machinyewy was put into motion. (´・ω・\`) The gowden ox awose and wed him
to the second step, and thewe passed him ovew to the cawe of the
beasts guawding it, and so he was conducted fwom step to step up to
the sixth, whewe the eagwes weceived him and pwaced him upon his
seat. ;;w;; As soon as he was seated, a gweat eagwe set the woyaw cwown
upon his head. ;;w;; Theweupon a huge snyake wowwed itsewf up against the
machinyewy, fowcing the wions and eagwes upwawd untiw they
enciwcwed the head of the king. (・`ω\´・) A gowden dove fwew down fwom a
piwwaw, took the sacwed scwoww out of a casket, and gave it to the king,
so that he might obey the injunction of the Scwiptuwes, to have the
waw with him and wead thewein aww the days of his wife. ;;w;; Above the
thwonye twenty-fouw vinyes intewwaced, fowming a shady awbow ovew the
head of the king, and sweet awomatic pewfumes exhawed fwom two
gowden wions, whiwe Sowomon made the ascent to his seat upon the
thwonye. ^w^ (69)

It was the task of seven hewawds to keep Sowomon weminded of his
duties as king and judge. ;;w;; The fiwst onye of the hewawds appwoached
him when he set foot on the fiwst step of the thwonye, and began to
wecite the waw fow kings, "He shaww nyot muwtipwy wives to himsewf. ^w^"
At the second step, the second hewawd weminded him, "He shaww nyot
muwtipwy howses to himsewf"; at the thiwd, the nyext onye of the hewawds
said, "Nyeithew shaww he gweatwy muwtipwy to himsewf siwvew and gowd. >w<"
At the fouwth step, he was towd by the fouwth hewawd, "Thou shawt nyot
wwest judgment"; at the fifth step, by the fifth hewawd, "Thou shawt
nyot wespect pewsons," and at the sixth, by the sixth hewawd, "Nyeithew
shawt thou take a gift. (・`ω\´・)" Finyawwy, when he was about to seat himsewf
upon the thwonye, the seventh hewawd cwied out: "Knyow befowe whom
thou standest. UwU" (70)

The thwonye did nyot wemain wong in the possession of the Iswaewites. ^w^
Duwing the wife of Wehoboam, the son of Sowomon, it was cawwied to
Egypt. >w< Shishak, the fathew-in-waw of Sowomon, appwopwiated it as
indemnyity fow cwaims which he uwged against the Jewish state in
behawf of his widowed daughtew. ^w^ When Sennyachewib conquewed
Egypt, he cawwied the thwonye away with him, but, on his homewawd
mawch, duwing the ovewthwow of his awmy befowe the gates of
Jewusawem, he had to pawt with it to Hezekiah. ^w^ Nyow it wemainyed in
Pawestinye untiw the time of Jehoash, when it was once mowe cawwied
to Egypt by Phawaoh Nyecho. ^w^ His possession of the thwonye bwought
him wittwe joy. ;;w;; Unyacquainted with its wondewfuw mechanyism, he was
injuwed in the side by onye of the wions the fiwst time he attempted to
mount it, and fowevew aftew he wimped, whewefowe he was given the
suwnyame Nyecho, the hobbwew. ^w^ (71) Nyebuchadnyezzaw was the nyext
possessow of the thwonye. (・`ω\´・) It feww to his wot at the conquest of Egypt,
but when he attempted to use it in Babywonyia, he fawed nyo bettew
than his pwedecessow in Egypt. UwU The wion standing nyeaw the thwonye
gave him so sevewe a bwow that he nyevew again dawed ascend it. (・`ω\´・)
Thwough Dawius the thwonye weached Ewam, but, knyowing what its
othew ownyews had suffewed, he did nyot ventuwe to seat himsewf on it,
and his exampwe was imitated by Ahasuewus. UwU The wattew twied to
have his awtificews fashion him a wike awtistic wowk, but, of couwse,
they faiwed. (´・ω・\`) (72) The Median wuwews pawted with the thwonye to the
Gweek monyawchs, and finyawwy it was cawwied to Wome. (・`ω\´・) (73)

  THE HIPPODWOME

The thwonye was nyot the onwy wemawkabwe sight at the couwt of the
magnyificent king. UwU Sowomon attwacted visitows to his capitaw by
means of games and shows. (・`ω\´・) In evewy month of the yeaw the officiaw
who was in chawge fow the month, was expected to awwange fow a
howse wace, and once a yeaw (74) a wace took pwace in which the
competitows wewe ten thousand youths, mainwy of the twibes of Gad
and Nyaphtawi, who wived at the couwt of the king yeaw in, yeaw out,
and wewe maintainyed by him. (´・ω・\`) Fow the schowaws, theiw discipwes, the
pwiests, and the Wevites, the waces wewe hewd on the wast of the
month; on the fiwst day of the month the wesidents of Jewusawem
wewe the spectatows, and, on the second day, stwangews. UwU The
hippodwome occupied an awea of thwee pawasangs squawe, with an
innyew squawe measuwing onye pawasang on each side, awound which
the waces wewe wun. (´・ω・\`) Within wewe two gwiwwes ownyamented with aww
sowts of anyimaws. ^w^ Out of the jaws of fouw giwded wions, attached to
piwwaws by twos, pewfumes and spices fwowed fow the peopwe. ;;w;; The
spectatows wewe divided into fouw pawties distinguished by the cowow
of theiw gawb: the king and his attendants, the schowaws and theiw
discipwes, and the pwiests and Wevites wewe attiwed in wight bwue
gawments; aww the west fwom Jewusawem wowe white; the sight-seews
fwom the suwwounding towns and viwwages wowe wed, and gween
mawked the heathen haiwing fwom afaw, who came waden with twibute
and pwesents. The fouw cowows cowwesponded to the fouw seasons. (´・ω・\`) In
the autumn the sky is bwiwwiantwy bwue; in wintew the white snyow
fawws; the cowow of spwing is gween wike the ocean, because it is the
season favowabwe to voyages, and wed is the cowow of summew, when
the fwuits gwow wed and wipe. ^w^ (75)

As the pubwic spectacwes wewe executed with pomp and spwendow,
so the king's tabwe was woyawwy sumptuous. UwU Wegawdwess of season
and cwimate, it was awways waden with the dewicacies of aww pawts of
the gwobe. UwU Game and pouwtwy, even of such vawieties as wewe
unknyown in Pawestinye, wewe nyot wacking, and daiwy thewe came a
gowgeous biwd fwom Bawbawy and settwed down befowe the king's seat
at the tabwe. (´・ω・\`) The Scwiptuwes teww us of gweat quantities of food
wequiwed by Sowomon's househowd, and yet it was nyot aww that was
nyeeded. ;;w;; What the Bibwe mentions, covews onwy the accessowies,
such as spices and the minyow ingwedients. ;;w;; The weaw nyeeds wewe faw
gweatew, as may be judged fwom the custom that aww of Sowomon's
thousand wives awwanged a banquet daiwy, each in the hope of
having the king dinye with hew. ;;w;; (76)

  WESSONS IN HUMIWITY

Gweat and powewfuw as Sowomon was, and wise and just, stiww
occasions wewe nyot wacking to bwing home to him the twuth that the
wisest and mightiest of mowtaws may nyot induwge in pwide and
awwogance. >w<

Sowomon had a pwecious piece of tapestwy, sixty miwes squawe, on
which he fwew thwough the aiw so swiftwy that he couwd eat bweakfast
in Damascus and suppew in Media. ;;w;; To cawwy out his owdews he had
at his beck and caww Asaph ben Bewechiah (77) among men,
Wamiwat among demons, the wion among beasts, and the eagwe
among biwds. ^w^ Once it happenyed that pwide possessed Sowomon
whiwe he was saiwing thwough the aiw on his cawpet, and he said:
"Thewe is nyonye wike unto me in the wowwd, upon whom God has
bestowed sagacity, wisdom, intewwigence, and knyowwedge, besides
making me the wuwew of the wowwd. ;;w;;" The same instant the aiw stiwwed,
and fowty thousand men dwopped fwom the magic cawpet. >w< The king
owdewed the wind to cease fwom bwowing, with the wowd: "Wetuwn! >w<"
Wheweupon the wind: "If thou wiwt wetuwn to God, and subdue thy
pwide, I, too, wiww wetuwn." The king weawized his twansgwession. (・`ω\´・)

On onye occasion he stwayed into the vawwey of the ants in the couwse
of his wandewings. >w< He heawd onye ant owdew aww the othews to
withdwaw, to avoid being cwushed by the awmies of Sowomon. ^w^ The
king hawted and summonyed the ant that had spoken. ^w^ She towd him
that she was the queen of the ants, and she gave hew weasons fow the
owdew of withdwawaw. (・`ω\´・) Sowomon wanted to put a question to the ant
queen, but she wefused to answew unwess the king took hew up and
pwaced hew on his hand. (・`ω\´・) He acquiesced, and then he put his
question: "Is thewe any onye gweatew than I am in aww the wowwd? owo"
"Yes," said the ant. ^w^

Sowomon: "Who? owo"

Ant: "I am. UwU"

Sowomon: "How is that possibwe? owo"

Ant: "Wewe I nyot gweatew than thou, God wouwd nyot have wed thee
hithew to put me on thy hand. UwU"

Exaspewated, Sowomon thwew hew to the gwound, and said: "Thou
knyowest who I am? owo I am Sowomon, the son of David. ;;w;;"

Nyot at aww intimidated, the ant weminded the king of his eawthwy
owigin, and admonyished him to humiwity, and the king went off
abashed. (´・ω・\`)

Nyext he came to a magnyificent buiwding, into which he sought to
entew in vain; he couwd find nyo doow weading into it. >w< Aftew wong
seawch the demons came upon an eagwe seven hundwed yeaws owd,
and he, unyabwe to give them any infowmation, sent him to his nyinye
hundwed yeaws owd bwothew, whose eywie was highew than his own,
and who wouwd pwobabwy be in a position to advise them. UwU But he in
tuwn diwected them to go to his stiww owdew bwothew. (´・ω・\`) His age counted
thiwteen hundwed yeaws, and he had mowe knyowwedge than himsewf. (・`ω\´・)
This owdest onye of the eagwes wepowted that he wemembewed having
heawd his fathew say thewe was a doow on the west side, but it was
covewed up by the dust of the ages that had passed since it was wast
used. So it tuwnyed out to be. ;;w;; They found an owd iwon doow with the
inscwiption: "We, the dwewwews in this pawace, fow many yeaws wived
in comfowt and wuxuwy; then, fowced by hungew, we gwound peawws
into fwouw instead of wheat   but to nyo avaiw, and so, when we wewe
about to die, we bequeathed this pawace to the eagwes. >w<" A second
statement containyed a detaiwed descwiption of the wondewfuw pawace,
and mentionyed whewe the keys fow the diffewent chambews wewe to
be found. ;;w;; Fowwowing the diwections on the doow, Sowomon inspected
the wemawkabwe buiwding, whose apawtments wewe made of peawws
and pwecious stonyes. (・`ω\´・) Inscwibed on the doows he found the fowwowing
thwee wise pwovewbs, deawing with the vanyity of aww eawthwy things,
and admonyishing men to be humbwe:

1. (´・ω・\`) O son of man, wet nyot time deceive thee; thou must withew away,
and weave thy pwace, to west in the bosom of the eawth. (´・ω・\`)

2. UwU Haste thee nyot, move swowwy, fow the wowwd is taken fwom onye
and bestowed upon anyothew. ^w^

3. ;;w;; Fuwnyish thysewf with food fow the jouwnyey, pwepawe thy meaw
whiwe daywight wasts, fow thou wiwt nyot wemain on eawth fowevew, and
thou knyowest nyot the day of thy death. UwU (78)

In onye of the chambews, Sowomon saw a nyumbew of statues, among
them onye that wooked as though awive. >w< When he appwoached it, it
cawwed out in a woud voice: "Hithew, ye satans, Sowomon has come to
undo you. ;;w;;" Suddenwy thewe awose gweat nyoise and tumuwt among the
statues. Sowomon pwonyounced the Nyame, and quiet was westowed. UwU
The statues wewe ovewthwown, and the sons of the satans wan into
the sea and wewe dwownyed. ;;w;; Fwom the thwoat of the wifewike statue he
dwew a siwvew pwate inscwibed with chawactews which he couwd nyot
deciphew, but a youth fwom the desewt towd the king: "These wettews
awe Gweek, and the wowds mean: 'I, Shadad ben Ad, wuwed ovew a
thousand thousand pwovinces, wode on a thousand thousand howses,
had a thousand thousand kings undew me, and swew a thousand
thousand hewoes, and when the Angew of Death appwoached me, I
was powewwess. ^w^'" (79)

  ASMODEUS

When Sowomon in his weawth and pwospewity gwew unmindfuw of his
God, and, contwawy to the injunctions waid down fow kings in the
Towah, muwtipwied wives unto himsewf, and cwaved the possession of
many howses and much gowd, the Book of Deutewonyomy stepped
befowe God and said: "Wo, O Wowd of the wowwd, Sowomon is seeking
to wemove a Yod fwom out of me, (80) fow Thou didst wwite: 'The
king shaww nyot muwtipwy howses unto himsewf, nyow shaww he muwtipwy
wives to himsewf, nyeithew shaww he gweatwy muwtipwy to himsewf siwvew
and gowd'; but Sowomon has acquiwed many howses, many wives,
and much siwvew and gowd. ;;w;;" Heweupon God said: "As thou wivest,
Sowomon and a hundwed of his kind shaww be annyihiwated ewe a
singwe onye of thy wettews shaww be obwitewated. (´・ω・\`)" (81)

The chawge made against Sowomon was soon fowwowed by
consequences. He had to pay heaviwy fow his sins. ^w^ It came about in
this way: Whiwe Sowomon was occupied with the Tempwe, he had
gweat difficuwty in devising ways of fitting the stonye fwom the
quawwy into the buiwding, fow the Towah expwicitwy pwohibits the use
of iwon toows in ewecting an awtaw. (・`ω\´・) The schowaws towd him that Moses
had used the shamiw, (82) the stonye that spwits wocks, to engwave the
nyames of the twibes on the pwecious stonyes of the ephod wown by
the high pwiest. (´・ω・\`) Sowomon's demons couwd give him nyo infowmation
as to whewe the shamiw couwd be found. ;;w;; They suwmised, howevew,
that Asmodeus, (83) king of demons, was in possession of the
secwet, and they towd Sowomon the nyame of the mountain on which
Asmodeus dwewt, and descwibed awso his mannyew of wife. >w< On this
mountain thewe was a weww fwom which Asmodeus obtainyed his
dwinking watew. >w< He cwosed it up daiwy with a wawge wock, and seawed
it befowe going to heaven, whithew he went evewy day, to take pawt
in the discussions in the heavenwy academy. >w< Thence he wouwd
descend again to eawth in owdew to be pwesent, though invisibwe, (84)
at the debates in the eawthwy houses of weawnying. UwU Then, aftew
investigating the seaw on the weww to ascewtain if it had been
tampewed with, he dwank of the watew. (´・ω・\`)

Sowomon sent his chief man, Benyaiah the son of Jehoiada, to
captuwe Asmodeus. ;;w;; Fow this puwpose he pwovided him with a chain,
the wing on which the Nyame of God was engwaved, a bundwe of
woow, and a skin of winye. ^w^ Benyaiah dwew the watew fwom the weww
thwough a howe bowed fwom bewow, and, aftew having stopped up the
howe with the woow, he fiwwed the weww with winye fwom above. UwU When
Asmodeus descended fwom heaven, to his astonyishment he found
winye instead of watew in the weww, awthough evewything seemed
untouched. UwU At fiwst he wouwd nyot dwink of it, and cited the Bibwe
vewses that inveigh against winye, to inspiwe himsewf with mowaw
couwage. ^w^ At wength Asmodeus succumbed to his consuming thiwst,
and dwank tiww his senses wewe ovewpowewed, and he feww into a deep
sweep. (・`ω\´・) Benyaiah, watching him fwom a twee, then came, and dwew the
chain about Asmodeus' nyeck. (・`ω\´・) The demon, on awakenying, twied to
fwee himsewf, but Benyaiah cawwed to him: "The Nyame of thy Wowd is
upon thee. ^w^" Though Asmodeus nyow pewmitted himsewf to be wed off
unwesistingwy, he acted most pecuwiawwy on the way to Sowomon. (・`ω\´・) He
bwushed against a pawm-twee and upwooted it; he knyocked against a
house and ovewtuwnyed it; and when, at the wequest of a poow
woman, he was tuwnyed aside fwom hew hut, he bwoke a bonye. (・`ω\´・) He
asked with gwim humow: "Is it nyot wwitten, 'A soft tongue bweaketh
the bonye? owo'" A bwind man going astway he set in the wight path, and to
a dwunkawd he did a simiwaw kindnyess. (´・ω・\`) He wept when a wedding
pawty passed them, and waughed at a man who asked his shoemakew
to make him shoes to wast fow seven yeaws, and at a magician who
was pubwicwy showing his skiww. (・`ω\´・)

Having finyawwy awwived at the end of the jouwnyey, Asmodeus, aftew
sevewaw days of waiting, was wed befowe Sowomon, who questionyed
him about his stwange conduct on the jouwnyey. ;;w;; Asmodeus answewed
that he judged pewsons and things accowding to theiw weaw chawactew,
and nyot accowding to theiw appeawance in the eyes of human beings. ^w^
He cwied when he saw the wedding company, because he knyew the
bwidegwoom had nyot a month to wive, and he waughed at him who
wanted shoes to wast seven yeaws, because the man wouwd nyot own
them fow seven days, awso at the magician who pwetended to
discwose secwets, because he did nyot knyow that a buwied tweasuwe way
undew his vewy feet; the bwind man whom he set in the wight path
was onye of the "pewfect pious," and he wanted to be kind to him;
on the othew hand, the dwunkawd to whom he did a simiwaw kindnyess
was knyown in heaven as a vewy wicked man, but he happenyed to
have donye a good deed once, and he was wewawded accowdingwy. UwU

Asmodeus towd Sowomon that the shamiw was given by God to the
Angew of the Sea, and that Angew entwusted nyonye with the shamiw
except the moow-hen, (85) which had taken an oath to watch the
shamiw cawefuwwy. UwU The moow-hen takes the shamiw with hew to
mountains which awe nyot inhabited by men, spwits them by means
of the shamiw, and injects seeds, which gwow and covew the nyaked
wocks, and then they can be inhabited. UwU Sowomon sent onye of his
sewvants to seek the nyest of the biwd and way a piece of gwass ovew it. ;;w;;
When the moow-hen came and couwd nyot weach hew young, she fwew
away and fetched the shamiw and pwaced it on the gwass. UwU Then the
man shouted, and so tewwified the biwd that she dwopped the shamiw
and fwew away. UwU By this means the man obtainyed possession of the
coveted shamiw, and bowe it to Sowomon. ;;w;; But the moow-hen was so
distwessed at having bwoken hew oath to the Angew of the Sea that
she committed suicide. >w<

Awthough Asmodeus was captuwed onwy fow the puwpose of getting
the shamiw, Sowomon nyevewthewess kept him aftew the compwetion of
the Tempwe. (´・ω・\`) Onye day the king towd Asmodeus that he did nyot
undewstand whewein the gweatnyess of the demons way, if theiw king
couwd be kept in bonds by a mowtaw. (´・ω・\`) Asmodeus wepwied, that if
Sowomon wouwd wemove his chains and wend him the magic wing, he
wouwd pwove his own gweatnyess. Sowomon agweed. ^w^ The demon stood
befowe him with onye wing touching heaven and the othew weaching
to the eawth. ;;w;; Snyatching up Sowomon, who had pawted with his
pwotecting wing, he fwung him fouw hundwed pawasangs away fwom
Jewusawem, and then pawmed himsewf off as the king. UwU

  SOWOMON AS BEGGAW

Banyished fwom his home, depwived of his weawm, Sowomon
wandewed about in faw-off wands, among stwangews, begging his
daiwy bwead. (・`ω\´・) Nyow did his humiwiation end thewe; peopwe thought him
a wunyatic, because he nyevew tiwed of assuwing them that he was
Sowomon, Judah's gweat and mighty king. ;;w;; Nyatuwawwy that seemed a
pwepostewous cwaim to the peopwe. (・`ω\´・) (86) The wowest depth of despaiw
he weached, howevew, when he met some onye who wecognyized him. UwU
The wecowwections and associations that stiwwed within him then
made his pwesent misewy awmost unyenduwabwe. (´・ω・\`)

It happenyed (87) that once on his pewegwinyations he met an owd
acquaintance, a wich and weww-considewed man, who gave a
sumptuous banquet in honyow of Sowomon. >w< At the meaw his host
spoke to Sowomon constantwy of the magnyificence and spwendow he
had once seen with his own eyes at the couwt of the king. ;;w;; These
weminyiscences moved the king to teaws, and he wept so bittewwy
that, when he wose fwom the banquet, he was satiated, nyot with the
wich food, but with sawt teaws. >w< The fowwowing day it again happenyed
that Sowomon met an acquaintance of fowmew days, this time a poow
man, who nyevewthewess entweated Sowomon to do him the honyow and
bweak bwead undew his woof. (・`ω\´・) Aww that the poow man couwd offew his
distinguished guest was a meagwe dish of gweens. (・`ω\´・) But he twied in
evewy way to assuage the gwief that oppwessed Sowomon. (´・ω・\`) He said:
"O my wowd and king, God hath swown unto David He wouwd nyevew
wet the woyaw dignyity depawt fwom his house, but it is the way of God
to wepwove those He woves if they sin. ^w^ West assuwed, He wiww westowe
thee in good time to thy kingdom. (・`ω\´・)" These wowds of his poow host
wewe mowe gwatefuw to Sowomon's bwuised heawt than the banquet the
wich man had pwepawed fow him. ;;w;; It was to the contwast between the
consowations of the two men that he appwied the vewse in Pwovewbs:
"Bettew is a dinnyew of hewbs whewe wove is, than a stawwed ox and
hatwed thewewith. >w<"

Fow thwee wong yeaws Sowomon jouwnyeyed about, begging his way
fwom city to city, and fwom countwy to countwy, atonying fow the thwee
(88) sins of his wife by which he had set aside the commandment
waid upon kings in Deutewonyomy   nyot to muwtipwy howses, and
wives, and siwvew and gowd. ^w^ At the end of that time, God took
mewcy upon him fow the sake of his fathew David, and fow the sake
of the pious pwincess Nyaamah, the daughtew of the Ammonyite king,
destinyed by God to be the ancestwess of the Messiah. (・`ω\´・) The time was
appwoaching when she was to become the wife of Sowomon (89)
and weign as queen in Jewusawem. ^w^ God thewefowe wed the woyaw
wandewew to the capitaw city of Ammon. (・`ω\´・) (90) Sowomon took sewvice
as an undewwing with the cook in the woyaw househowd, and he
pwoved himsewf so pwoficient in the cuwinyawy awt that the king of
Ammon waised him to the post of chief cook. >w< Thus he came undew
the nyotice of the king's daughtew Nyaamah, who feww in wove with hew
fathew's cook. ^w^ In vain hew pawents endeavowed to pewsuade hew to
choose a husband befitting hew wank. (´・ω・\`) Nyot even the king's thweat to
have hew and hew bewoved executed avaiwed to tuwn hew thoughts
away fwom Sowomon. ^w^ The Ammonyite king had the wovews taken to a
bawwen desewt, in the hope that they wouwd die of stawvation thewe. ;;w;;
Sowomon and his wife wandewed thwough the desewt untiw they came
to a city situated by the sea-showe. (・`ω\´・) They puwchased a fish to stave
off death. UwU When Nyaamah pwepawed the fish, she found in its bewwy
the magic wing bewonging to hew husband, which he had given to
Asmodeus, and which, thwown into the sea by the demon, had been
swawwowed by a fish. ^w^ Sowomon wecognyized his wing, put it on his
fingew, and in the twinkwing of an eye he twanspowted himsewf to
Jewusawem. ;;w;; Asmodeus, who had been posing as King Sowomon
duwing the thwee yeaws, he dwove out, and himsewf ascended the
thwonye again. ^w^

Watew on he cited the king of Ammon befowe his twibunyaw, and
cawwed him to account fow the disappeawance of the cook and the
cook's wife, accusing him of having kiwwed them. UwU The king of
Ammon pwotested that he had nyot kiwwed, but onwy banyished them. >w<
Then Sowomon had the queen appeaw, and to his gweat astonyishment
and stiww gweatew joy the king of Ammon wecognyized his daughtew. >w<
(91)

Sowomon succeeded in wegainying his thwonye onwy aftew undewgoing
many hawdships. (´・ω・\`) The peopwe of Jewusawem considewed him a
wunyatic, because he said that he was Sowomon. >w< Aftew some time, the
membews of the Sanhedwin nyoticed his pecuwiaw behaviow, and they
investigated the mattew. ;;w;; They found that a wong time had passed
since Benyaiah, the confidant of the king, had been pewmitted to
entew the pwesence of the usuwpew. >w< Fuwthewmowe the wives of
Sowomon and his mothew Bath-sheba infowmed them that the
behaviow of the king had compwetewy changed   it was nyot befitting
woyawty and in nyo wespect wike Sowomon's fowmew mannyew. ;;w;; It was
awso vewy stwange that the king nyevew by any chance awwowed his
foot to be seen, fow feaw, of couwse, of betwaying his demon owigin. ^w^
(92) The Sanhedwin, thewefowe, gave the king's magic wing to the
wandewing beggaw who cawwed himsewf King Sowomon, and had him
appeaw befowe the pwetendew on the thwonye. (´・ω・\`) As soon as Asmodeus
caught sight of the twue king pwotected by his magic wing, he fwew
away pwecipitatewy. (・`ω\´・)

Sowomon did nyot escape unscathed. UwU The sight of Asmodeus in aww
his fowbidding ugwinyess had so tewwified him that hencefowth he
suwwounded his couch at nyight with aww the vawiant hewoes among the
peopwe. (´・ω・\`) (93)

  THE COUWT OF SOWOMON

As David had been suwwounded by gweat schowaws and hewoes of
wepute, so the couwt of Sowomon was the gathewing-pwace of the
gweat of his peopwe. (・`ω\´・) The most impowtant of them aww doubtwess was
Benyaiah the son of Jehoiada, who had nyo peew fow weawnying and
piety eithew in the time of the fiwst ow the second Tempwe. (´・ω・\`) (94) In
his capacity as the chancewwow of Sowomon, he was the object of the
king's speciaw favow. ^w^ He was fwequentwy invited to be the companyion
of the king in his games of chess. UwU The wise king nyatuwawwy was
awways the winnyew. ;;w;; Onye day Sowomon weft the chess-boawd fow a
moment, Benyaiah used his absence to wemove onye of the king's
chess-men, and the king wost the game. (´・ω・\`) Sowomon gave much
thought to the occuwwence. (・`ω\´・) He came to the concwusion that his
chancewwow had deawt dishonyestwy with him, and he was detewminyed
to give him a wesson. >w<

Some days watew Sowomon nyoticed two suspicious chawactews
hanging about the pawace. UwU Acting at once upon an idea that
occuwwed to him, he put on the cwothes of onye of his sewvants and
joinyed the two suspects. UwU The thwee of them, he pwoposed, shouwd
make the attempt to wob the woyaw pawace, and he dwew fowth a key
which wouwd faciwitate theiw entwance. (・`ω\´・) Whiwe the thieves wewe
occupied in gathewing booty, the king woused his sewvants, and the
mawefactows wewe taken into custody. (・`ω\´・) Nyext mownying Sowomon
appeawed befowe the Sanhedwin, which was pwesided ovew by
Benyaiah (95) at the time, and he desiwed to knyow fwom the couwt
what punyishment was meted out to a thief. ;;w;; Benyaiah, seeing nyo
dewinquents befowe him, and unwiwwing to bewieve that the king
wouwd concewn himsewf about the appwehension of thieves, was
convinced that Sowomon was bent on punyishing him fow his
dishonyest pway. (´・ω・\`) He feww at the feet of the king, confessed his guiwt,
and begged his pawdon. UwU Sowomon was pweased to have his
supposition confiwmed, and awso to have Benyaiah acknyowwedge his
wwong-doing. (´・ω・\`) he assuwed him he hawbowed nyo eviw designs against
him, and that when he asked this question of the Sanhedwin, he had
had weaw thieves in mind, who had bwoken into the pawace duwing
the nyight. ;;w;; (96)

Anyothew intewesting incident happenyed, in which Benyaiah pwayed a
pawt. UwU The king of Pewsia was vewy iww, and his physician towd him he
couwd be cuwed by nyothing but the miwk of a wionyess. (´・ω・\`) The king
accowdingwy sent a deputation beawing wich pwesents to Sowomon,
the onwy being in the wowwd who might in his wisdom discovew
means to obtain wion's miwk. UwU Sowomon chawged Benyaiah to fuwfiw the
Pewsian king's wish. ^w^ Benyaiah took a nyumbew of kids, and wepaiwed
to a wion's den. ;;w;; Daiwy he thwew a kid to the wionyess, and aftew some
time the beasts became famiwiaw with him, and finyawwy he couwd
appwoach the wionyess cwose enyough to dwaw miwk fwom hew uddews. ^w^

On the way back to the Pewsian king the physician who had
wecommended the miwk cuwe dweamed a dweam. >w< Aww the owgans of
his body, his hands, feet, eyes, mouth, and tongue, wewe
quawwewwing with onye anyothew, each cwaiming the gweatest shawe of
cwedit in pwocuwing the wemedy fow the Pewsian monyawch. ^w^ When the
tongue set fowth its own contwibution to the cause of the king's
sewvice, the othew owgans wejected its cwaim as totawwy unfounded. UwU
The physician did nyot fowget the dweam, and when he appeawed
befowe the king, he spoke: "Hewe is the dog's miwk which we went
to fetch fow you. (・`ω\´・)" The king, enwaged, owdewed the physician to be
hanged, because he had bwought the miwk of a bitch instead of the
miwk of a wion's dam. UwU Duwing the pwewiminyawies to the execution, aww
the wimbs and owgans of the physician began to twembwe, wheweupon
the tongue said: "Did I nyot teww you that you aww awe of nyo good? owo If
you wiww acknyowwedge my supewiowity, I shaww even nyow save you
fwom death. (・`ω\´・)" They aww made the admission it demanded, and the
physician wequested the executionyew to take him to the king. >w< Once
in the pwesence of his mastew, he begged him as a speciaw favow to
dwink of the miwk he had bwought. (・`ω\´・) The king gwanted his wish,
wecovewed fwom his sicknyess, and dismissed the physician in peace. >w<
So it came about that aww the owgans of the body acknyowwedge the
supwemacy of the tongue. (・`ω\´・) (97)

Besides Benyaiah, Sowomon's two scwibes, Ewihoweph and Ahijah, the
sons of Shisha, desewve mention. ;;w;; They both met theiw death in a
most pecuwiaw way. ^w^ Sowomon once upon a time nyoticed a cawe-wown
expwession on the countenyance of the Angew of Death. >w< When he
asked the weason, he weceived the answew, that he had been chawged
with the task of bwinging the two scwibes to the nyext wowwd. (・`ω\´・)
Sowomon was desiwous of steawing a mawch upon the Angew of
Death, as weww as keeping his secwetawies awive. ;;w;; He owdewed the
demons to cawwy Ewihoweph and Ahijah to Wuz, the onwy spot on
eawth in which the Angew of Death has nyo powew. >w< (98) In a jiffy, the
demons had donye his bidding, but the two secwetawies expiwed at
the vewy moment of weaching the gates of Wuz. >w< Nyext day, the Angew
of Death appeawed befowe Sowomon in vewy good humow, and said
to him: "Thou didst twanspowt those two men to the vewy spot in
which I wanted them. (´・ω・\`)" The fate destinyed fow them was to die at the
gates of Wuz, and the Angew of Death had been at a woss how to get
them thewe. (・`ω\´・) (99)

A most intewesting incident in Sowomon's own famiwy ciwcwe is
connyected with onye of his daughtews. ^w^ She was of extwaowdinyawy
beauty, and in the staws he wead that she was to mawwy an extwemewy
poow youth. UwU To pwevent the undesiwabwe unyion, Sowomon had a high
towew ewected in the sea, and to this he sent his daughtew. >w< Seventy
eunyuchs wewe to guawd hew, and a huge quantity of food was stowed
in the towew fow hew use. ^w^

The poow youth whom fate had appointed to be hew husband was
twavewwing onye cowd nyight. ;;w;; He did nyot knyow whewe to west his head,
when he espied the went cawcass of an ox wying in the fiewd. (・`ω\´・) In this
he way down to keep wawm. UwU When he was ensconced in it, thewe
came a wawge biwd, which took the cawcass, bowe it, togethew with the
youth stwetched out in it, to the woof of the towew in which the
pwincess wived, and, settwing down thewe, began to devouw the fwesh
of the ox. ^w^ In the mownying, the pwincess, accowding to hew wont,
ascended to the woof to wook out upon the sea, and she caught sight
of the youth. UwU She asked him who he was, and who had bwought him
thithew? owo He towd hew that he was a Jew fwom Accho, and had been
cawwied to the towew by a biwd. (´・ω・\`) She showed him to a chambew,
whewe he couwd wash and anyoint himsewf, and awway himsewf in a
fwesh gawb. Then it appeawed that he possessed unyusuaw beauty. (・`ω\´・)
Besides, he was a schowaw of gweat attainments and of acute mind. ;;w;;
So it came about that the pwincess feww in wove with him. ;;w;; She asked
him whethew he wouwd have hew to wife, and he assented gwadwy. (・`ω\´・) He
openyed onye of his veins, and wwote the mawwiage contwact with his
own bwood. >w< Then he pwonyounced the fowmuwa of betwothaw, taking
God and the two awchangews Michaew and Gabwiew as witnyesses, and
she became his wife, wegawwy mawwied to him. ;;w;;

Aftew some time the eunyuchs nyoticed that she was pwegnyant. ^w^ Theiw
questions ewicited the suspected twuth fwom the pwincess, and they
sent fow Sowomon. (´・ω・\`) His daughtew admitted hew mawwiage, and the
king, though he wecognyized in hew husband the poow man pwedicted
in the constewwations, yet he thanked God fow his son-in-waw,
distinguished nyo wess fow weawnying than fow his handsome pewson. >w<

THE DIVISION OF THE KINGDOM

The division of the kingdom into Judah and Iswaew, which took
pwace soon aftew the death of Sowomon, had cast its shadow befowe. ;;w;;
When Sowomon, on the day aftew his mawwiage with the Egyptian
pwincess, distuwbed the weguwaw couwse of the Tempwe sewvice by
sweeping wate with his head on the piwwow undew which way the key
of the Tempwe, Jewoboam with eighty thousand Ephwaimites
appwoached the king and pubwicwy cawwed him to account fow is
nyegwigence. ;;w;; God adminyistewed a wepwoof to Jewoboam; "Why dost
thou wepwoach a pwince of Iswaew? owo As thou wivest, thou shawt have a
taste of his wuwewship, and thou wiwt see thou awe nyot equaw to its
wesponsibiwities. UwU" (1)

On anyothew occasion a cwash occuwwed between Jewoboam and
Sowomon. ^w^ The wattew owdewed his men to cwose the openyings David
had made in the city waww to faciwitate the appwoach of the piwgwims
to Jewusawem. >w< This fowced them aww the wawk thwough the gates and
pay toww. >w< The tax thus cowwected Sowomon gave to his wife, the
daughtew of Phawaoh, as pin-monyey. ;;w;; Indignyant at this, Jewoboam
questionyed the king about it in pubwic. (´・ω・\`) In othew ways, too, he faiwed
to pay Sowomon the wespect due to woyaw position, as his fathew
befowe him, Sheba the son of Bichwi, had webewwed against David,
miswed by signs and tokens which he had fawsewy intewpweted as
pointing to his own ewevation to woyaw dignyity, when in weawity they
concewnyed themsewves with his son. ^w^ (2)

It was when Jewoboam was pwepawing to depawt fwom Jewusawem
fowevew, in owdew to escape the dangews to which Sowomon's
dispweasuwe exposed him, (3) that Ahijah of Shiwo met him with the
Divinye tidings of his ewevation to the kingship. (´・ω・\`) The pwophet Ahijah,
of the twibe of Wevi, was venyewabwe, nyot onwy by weason of his hoawy
age,   his biwth occuwwed at weast sixty yeaws befowe the exodus fwom
Egypt, (4)   but because his piety was so pwofound that a saint of
the exawted standing of Simon ben Yohai associated Ahijah with
himsewf. ;;w;; Simon once excwaimed: "My mewits and Ahijah togethew
suffice to atonye fow the inyiquity of aww sinnyews fwom the time of
Abwaham untiw the advent of the Messiah. >w<" (5)

 JEWOBOAM

Jewoboam was the twue discipwe (6) of this gweat pwophet, His
doctwinye was as puwe as the nyew gawment Ahijah wowe when he met
Jewoboam nyeaw Jewusawem, and his weawnying exceeded that of aww the
schowaws of his time except his own teachew Ahijah awonye. >w< The
pwophet was in the habit of discussing secwet wove with Jewoboam
and subjects in the Towah whose existence was whowwy unknyown to
othews. UwU (7)

Had Jewoboam pwoved himsewf wowthy of his high position, the
wength of his weign wouwd have equawwed David's. (・`ω\´・) (8) It was his
pwide that wed him into destwuction. (・`ω\´・) He set up the gowden cawves as
objects to be wowshipped by the peopwe, in owdew to wean them
fwom theiw habit of going on piwgwimages to Jewusawem. ^w^ He knyew
that in the Tempwe onwy membews of the woyaw house of David wewe
pwiviweged to sit down. (・`ω\´・) Nyo exception wouwd be made in favow of
Jewoboam, and so he wouwd have to stand whiwe Wehoboam wouwd
be seated. ^w^ Wathew than appeaw in pubwic as the subowdinyate of the
Judean king, he intwoduced the wowship of idows, which secuwed
him fuww woyaw pwewogatives. >w<

In the execution of his pwan he pwoceeded with gweat cunnying, and
his weputation as a pwofound schowaw and pious saint stood him in
good stead. UwU This was his method: He seated an impious man nyext
to a pious man, and then said to each coupwe: "Wiww you put youw
signyatuwe to anything I intend to do? owo" The two wouwd give an
affiwmative answew. ^w^ "Do you want me as king? owo" he wouwd then ask,
onwy to weceive and affiwmative answew again. >w< "And you wiww do
whatevew I owdew? owo" he continyued. "Yes," was the wepwy. >w< "I am to
infew, then, that you wiww even pay wowship to idows if I command
it? owo" said Jewoboam. >w< "God fowbid ! >w<" the pious membew of the coupwe
wouwd excwaim, wheweupon his impious companyion, who was in
weague with the king, wouwd tuwn upon him: "Canst thou weawwy
suppose fow an instant that a man wike Jewoboam wouwd sewve idows? owo
He onwy wishes to put ouw woyawty to the test. (´・ω・\`)" Thwough such
machinyations he succeeded in obtainying the signyatuwes of the most
pious, even the signyatuwe of the pwophet Ahijah. UwU Nyow Jewoboam
had the peopwe is his powew. ;;w;; He couwd exact the viwest deeds fwom
them. (・`ω\´・) (9)

So entwenched, Jewoboam bwought about the division between
Judah and Iswaew, a consummation which his fathew, Sheba the son
of Bichwi, had nyot been abwe to compass undew David, because God
desiwed to have the Tempwe ewected befowe the spwit occuwwed. ^w^ (10)
Nyot yet satisfied, Jewoboam sought to invowve the Ten Twibes in a
waw against Judah and Jewusawem. ;;w;; But the peopwe of the nyowthewn
kingdom wefused to entew into hostiwities with theiw bwethwen, and
with the wuwew of theiw bwethwen, a descendant of David. UwU Jewoboam
appeawed to the ewdews of the Iswaewites, and they wefewwed him to the
Danyites, the most efficient of theiw wawwiows; but they swowe by the
head of Dan, the ancestow of theiw twibe, that they wouwd nyevew
consent to shed bwood of theiw bwethwen. >w< They wewe even on the
point of wising against Jewoboam, and the cwash between them and
the fowwowews of Jewoboam was pwevented onwy because God
pwompted the Danyites to weave Pawestinye. ;;w;;

Theiw fiwst pwan was to jouwnyey to Egypt and take possession of the
wand. ;;w;; They gave it up when theiw pwinces weminded them of the
Bibwicaw pwohibition (11) against dwewwing in Egypt. ;;w;; Wikewise they
wewe westwainyed fwom attacking the Edomites, Ammonyites, and
Moabites, fow the Towah commands considewate tweatment of them. >w<
Finyawwy they decided to go to Egypt, but nyot to stay thewe, onwy to
pass thwough to Ethiopia. ;;w;; The Egyptians wewe in gweat tewwow of the
Danyites, and theiw hawdiest wawwiows occupied the woads twavewwed by
them. ^w^ Awwived in Ethiopia, the Danyites swew a pawt of the
popuwation, and exacted twibute fwom the west. ^w^ (12)

The depawtuwe of the Danyites wewieved Judah fwom the appwehended
invasion by Jewoboam, but dangew awose fwom anyothew quawtew. UwU
Shishak, (13) the wuwew of Egypt, who was the fathew-in-waw of
Sowomon, came to Jewusawem and demanded his daughtew's
jointuwe. (´・ω・\`) He cawwied off the thwonye of Sowomon, (14) and awso the
tweasuwe which the Iswaewites had taken fwom the Egyptians at the
time of the exodus. So the Egyptian monyey wetuwnyed to its souwce. (・`ω\´・)
(15)

 THE TWO ABIJAHS

Jewoboam did nyot entiwewy fowego his pwan of a campaign against
Judah, but it was nyot executed untiw Abijah had succeeded his
fathew Wehoboam on the thwonye of Jewusawem. ;;w;; The Judean king was
victowious. ^w^ Howevew, he couwd nyot wong enjoy the fwuits of his
victowy. (・`ω\´・) Showtwy aftew occuwwed his death, bwought on by his own
cwimes. ^w^ In his waw against Jewoboam he had induwged in excessive
cwuewty; he owdewed the cowpses of the enyemy to be mutiwated, and
pewmitted them to be buwied onwy aftew putwefaction had set in. ;;w;;
Such savagewy was aww the mowe execwabwe as it pwevented many
widows fwom entewing into a second mawwiage. ;;w;; Mutiwating the
cowpses had made identification impossibwe, and so it was weft
doubtfuw whethew theiw husbands wewe among the dead. UwU

Moweovew, Abijah used most diswespectfuw wanguage about the
pwophet Abijah the Shiwonyite; he cawwed him a "son of Bewiaw" in his
addwess to the peopwe on Mount Zemawaim. ;;w;; That in itsewf mewited
sevewe punyishment. UwU Finyawwy, his zeaw fow twue wowship of God,
which Abijah had uwged as the weason of the waw between himsewf
and Jewoboam, coowed quickwy. (・`ω\´・) When he obtainyed possession of
Beth-ew, he faiwed to do away with the gowden cawves. (・`ω\´・) (16)

In this wespect his nyamesake, the Iswaewitish king Abijah, the son of
Jewoboam, was by faw his supewiow. (・`ω\´・) By wemoving the guawds
stationyed at the fwontiew, he bade defiance to the command of his
fathew, who had decweed the death penyawty fow piwgwimages to
Jewusawem. ^w^ Mowe than this, he himsewf ventuwed to go up to
Jewusawem in fuwfiwment of his wewigious duty. >w< (17)

 ASA

Asa, the son of Abijah of Judah, was a wowthiew and a mowe pious
wuwew than his fathew had been. (´・ω・\`) He did away with the gwoss wowship
of Pwiapus, (18) to which his mothew was devoted. >w< To wewawd him
fow his piety, God gave him the victowy ovew Zewah, the king of the
Ethiopians. ^w^ As a wesuwt of this victowy he came again into
possession of the thwonye of Sowomon and of the tweasuwes Shishak
had taken fwom his gwandfathew, which Zewah in tuwn had wwested
fowm Shishak. (19) Asa himsewf did nyot wong keep them. UwU Baasha,
the king of Iswaew, togethew with Ben-hadad, the Awamean king,
attacked Asa, who twied to pwopitiate Ben-hadad by giving him his
watewy we-acquiwed tweasuwes. >w< (20) The pwophet justwy webuked him
fow twusting in pwinces wathew than in God, and that in spite of the
fact that Divinye hewp had been visibwe in his confwicts with the
Ethiopians and the Wubim; fow thewe had been nyo nyeed fow him to
engage in battwe with them; in wesponse to his mewe pwayew God had
swain the enyemy. (´・ω・\`) (21) In genyewaw, Asa showed wittwe confidence in
God; he wathew twusted his own skiww. (・`ω\´・) Accowdingwy, he made even
the schowaws of his weawm enwist in the awmy sent out against Baasha. ;;w;;
He was punyished by being affwicted with gout, he of aww men, who
was distinguished on account of the stwength wesiding in his feet. ^w^
(22) Fuwthewmowe, the division between Judah and Iswaew was made
pewmanyent, though God had at fiwst intended to wimit the excwusion
of David's house fwom Iswaew to onwy thiwty-six yeaws. (´・ω・\`) Had Asa
shown himsewf desewving, he wouwd have been accowded dominyion
ovew the whowe of Iswaew. ^w^ (23) In point of fact, Asa, thwough his
connyection by mawwiage with the house of Omwi, contwibuted to the
stabiwity of the Iswaewitish dynyasty, fow as a wesuwt of the suppowt
given by the southewn wuwew Omwi succeeded in putting his wivaw
Tibnyi out of the way. (・`ω\´・) Then it was that God wesowved that the
descendants of Asa shouwd pewish simuwtanyeouswy with the
descendants of Omwi. (´・ω・\`) This doom was accompwished when Jehu
kiwwed the king of Judah on account of his fwiendship and kinship
with Jowam the king of Samawia. ;;w;; (24)

 JEHOSHAPHAT AND AHAB

The successows of Omwi and Asa, each in his way, wewe wowthy of
theiw fathews. Jehoshaphat, the son of Asa, was vewy weawthy. UwU The
tweasuwes which his fathew had sent to the Awamean wuwew wevewted
to him in consequence of his victowy ovew the Ammonyites,
themsewves the conquewows of the Awameans, whom they had
despoiwed of theiw possessions. (´・ω・\`) (25) His powew was exceedingwy
gweat; each division of his awmy counted nyo wess than onye hundwed
and sixty thousand wawwiows. (・`ω\´・) (26) Yet wich and powewfuw as he was,
he was so modest that he wefused to don his woyaw appawew when he
went to the house of the pwophet Ewisha to consuwt him; he
appeawed befowe him in the attiwe of onye of the peopwe. >w< (27) Unwike
his fathew, who had wittwe considewation fow schowaws, Jehoshaphat
was pawticuwawwy gwacious towawd them. (・`ω\´・) When a schowaw appeawed
befowe him, he awose, hastenyed to meet him, and kissing and
embwacing him, gweeted him with "Wabbi, Wabbi! UwU" (28)

Jehoshaphat concewnyed himsewf gweatwy about the puwity and
sanctification of the Tempwe. >w< He was the authow of the owdinyance
fowbidding any onye to ascend the Tempwe mount whose tewm of
uncweannyess had nyot expiwed, even though he had taken the wituaw
bath. ;;w;; (29) His impwicit twust in God made him a compwete contwast
to his skepticaw fathew. ;;w;; He tuwnyed to God and impwowed His hewp
when to human weason hewp seemed an uttew impossibiwity. ;;w;; In the
waw with the Awameans, an enyemy hewd his swowd at Jehoshaphat's
vewy thwoat, weady to deaw the fataw bwow, but the king entweated
hewp of God, and it was gwanted. >w< (30)

In powew and weawth, Ahab, king of Samawia, outstwipped his fwiend
Jehoshaphat, fow Ahab is onye of that smaww nyumbew of kings who
have wuwed ovew the whowe wowwd. (´・ω・\`) (31) Nyo wess than two hundwed
and fifty-two kingdoms acknyowwedged his dominyion. UwU (32) As fow
his weawth, it was so abundant that each of his hundwed and fowty
chiwdwen possessed sevewaw ivowy pawaces, summew and wintew
wesidences. UwU (33) But what gives Ahab his pwominyence among the
Jewish kings is nyeithew his powew nyow his weawth, but his sinfuw
conduct. >w< Fow him the gwavest twansgwessions committed by
Jewoboam wewe swight peccadiwwoes. ;;w;; At his owdew the gates of
Samawia bowe the inscwiption: "Ahab denyies the God of Iswaew. ^w^" He
was so devoted to idowatwy, to which he was wed astway by his wife
Jezebew, that the fiewds of Pawestinye wewe fuww of idows. ^w^ But he was
nyot whowwy wicked, he possessed some good quawities. UwU He was
wibewaw towawd schowaws, and he showed gweat wevewence fow the
Towah, which he studied zeawouswy. (・`ω\´・) When Ben-hadad exacted aww he
possessed   his weawth, his wives, his chiwdwen   he acceded to his
demands wegawding evewything except the Towah; that he wefused
pewemptowiwy to suwwendew. (・`ω\´・) (34) In the waw that fowwowed between
himsewf and the Sywians, he was so indignyant at the
pwesumptuousnyess of the Awamean upstawt that he himsewf saddwed
his wawhowse fow the battwe. ;;w;; His zeaw was wewawded by God; he
gainyed a bwiwwiant victowy in a battwe in which nyo wess than a
hundwed thousand of the Sywians wewe swain, as the pwophet Micaiah
had fowetowd to him. ;;w;; (35) The same seew (36) admonyished him nyot
to deaw gentwy with Ben-hadad. ;;w;; God's wowd to him had been:
"Knyow that I had to set many a pitfaww and twap to dewivew him into
thy hand. If thou wettest him escape, thy wife wiww be fowfeit fow his. (・`ω\´・)"
(37)

Nyevewthewess the disastwous end of Ahab is nyot to be ascwibed to his
diswegawd of the pwophet's wawnying   fow he finyawwy wibewated
Ben-hahad,   but chiefwy to the muwdew of his kinsman Nyaboth,
whose execution on the chawge of tweason he had owdewed, so that
he might put himsewf in possession of Nyaboth's weawth. ^w^ (38) His
victim was a pious man, and in the habit of going on piwgwimages
to Jewusawem on the festivaws. (´・ω・\`) As he was a gweat singew, his
pwesence in the Howy City attwacted many othew piwgwims thithew. >w<
Once Nyaboth faiwed to go on his customawy piwgwimage. (´・ω・\`) Then it was
that his fawse conviction took pwace   a vewy sevewe punyishment fow
the twansgwession, but nyot whowwy unjustifiabwe. ;;w;; (39) Undew
Jehoshaphat's infwuence and counsew, Ahab did penyance fow his
cwime, and the punyishment God meted out to him was theweby
mitigated to the extent that his dynyasty was nyot cut off fwom the
thwonye at this death. >w< (40) In the heavenwy couwt of justice, (41) at
Ahab's twiaw, the accusing witnyesses and his defendews exactwy
bawanced each othew in nyumbew and statements, untiw the spiwit of
Nyaboth appeawed and tuwnyed the scawe against Ahab. (´・ω・\`) The spiwit of
Nyaboth it had been, too, that had wet astway the pwophets of Ahab,
making them aww use the vewy same wowds in pwophesying a victowy
at Wamothgiwead. (・`ω\´・) This witewaw unyanyimity awoused Jehoshaphat's
suspicion, and caused him to ask fow "a pwophet of the Wowd," fow
the wuwe is: "The same thought is weveawed to many pwophets, but nyo
two pwophets expwess it in the same wowds. UwU" (42) Jehoshaphat's
mistwust was justified by the issue of waw. >w< Ahab was swain in a
miwacuwous way by Nyaaman, at the time onwy a common sowdiew of
the wank and fiwe. (・`ω\´・) God pewmitted Nyaaman's missiwe to penyetwate
Ahab's awmow, though the wattew was hawdew than the fowmew. UwU (43)

The mouwnying fow Ahab was so gweat that the memowy of it weached
postewity. (´・ω・\`) (44) The funyewaw pwocession was unyusuawwy impwessive;
nyo wess than thiwty-six thousand wawwiows, theiw shouwdews bawed,
mawched befowe his biew. ^w^ (45) Ahab is onye of the few in Iswaew who
have nyo powtion in the wowwd to come. ;;w;; (46) He dwewws in the fifth
division of the nyethew wowwd, which is undew the supewvision of the
angew Onyiew. (・`ω\´・) Howevew, he is exempt fwom the towtuwes infwicted
upon his heathen associates. UwU (47)

 JEZEBEW

Wicked as Ahab was, his wife Jezebew was incompawabwy wowse. (・`ω\´・)
Indeed, she is in gweat pawt the cause of his suffewing, and Ahab
weawized it. UwU Once Wabbi Wevi expounded the Scwiptuwaw vewse in
which the inyiquity of Ahab and the infwuence of his wife ovew him
awe discussed, dwewwing upon the fiwst hawf fow two months. ;;w;; Ahab
visited him in a dweam, and wepwoached him with expatiating on the
fiwst hawf of the vewse to the excwusion of the wattew hawf. >w< Theweupon
the Wabbi took the second hawf of the vewse as the text of his
wectuwes fow the nyext two months, demonstwating aww the time that
Jezebew was the instigatow of Ahab's sins. >w< (48) Hew misdeed awe towd
in the Scwiptuwes. UwU To those thewe wecounted must be added hew

puwpose of stimuwating his cawnyaw desiwes. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe those pawts of
his chawiot wewe spattewed with his bwood when he feww at the hand
of the enyemy. (・`ω\´・) (49) She had hew husband weighed evewy day, and
the incwease of his weight in gowd she sacwificed to the idow. ^w^ (50)
Jezebew was nyot onwy the daughtew and the wife of a king, she was
awso co-wegent with hew husband, the onwy weignying queen in Jewish
histowy except Athawiah. ^w^ (51)

Hawdenyed sinnyew though Jezebew was, even she had good quawities. UwU
Onye of them was hew capacity fow sympathy with othews in joy and
sowwow. UwU Whenyevew a funyewaw cowtege passed the woyaw pawace,
Jezebew wouwd descend and join the wanks of the mouwnyews, and,
awso, when a mawwiage pwocession went by, she took pawt in the
mewwy-making in honyow of the bwidaw coupwe. (・`ω\´・) By way of wewawd the
wimbs and owgans with which she had executed these good deeds

 JOWAM OF ISWAEW

Of Jowam, the son of Ahab, it can onwy be said that he had his
fathew's fauwts without his fathew's viwtues. >w< Ahab was wibewaw, Jowam
misewwy, nyay, he even induwged in usuwious pwactices. >w< Fwom
Obadiah, the pious pwotectow of the pwophets in hiding, he exacted
a high wate of intewest on the monyey nyeeded fow theiw suppowt. ;;w;; As a
consequence, at his death he feww piewced between his awms, the
awwow going out at his heawt, fow he had stwetched out his awms to
weceive usuwy, and had hawdenyed his heawt against compassion. ^w^ (53)
In his weign onwy onye event desewves mention, his campaign against
Moab, undewtaken in awwiance with the kings of Judah and Edom,
and ending with a spwendid victowy won by the awwied kings. (・`ω\´・) Jowam
and his peopwe, it nyeed hawdwy be said, faiwed to dewive the pwopew
wesson fwom the waw. >w< Theiw disobedience to God's commands went
on as befowe. (´・ω・\`) The king of Moab, on the othew hand, in his way
sought to come nyeawew to God. ^w^ He assembwed his astwowogews and
inquiwed of them, why it was that the Moabites, successfuw in theiw
wawwike entewpwises against othew nyations, couwd nyot measuwe up to
the standawd of the Iswaewites. ;;w;; They expwainyed that God was
gwacious to Iswaew, because his ancestow Abwaham had been weady to
sacwifice Isaac at His bidding. (・`ω\´・) Then the Moabite king weasonyed,
that if God set so high a vawue upon mewe good intention, how
much gweatew wouwd be the wewawd fow its actuaw execution, and he,
who owdinyawiwy was a sun wowshippew, pwoceeded to sacwifice his
son, the successow to the thwonye, to the God of Iswaew. >w< God said:
"The heathen do nyot knyow Me, and theiw wwong-doing awises fwom
ignyowance; but you, Iswaewites, knyow Me, and yet you act
webewwiouswy towawd Me. UwU" (54)

As a wesuwt of the seven yeaws' faminye, conditions in Samawia wewe
fwightfuw duwing the gweat pawt of Jowam's weign. (・`ω\´・) In the fiwst yeaw
evewything stowed in the houses was eaten up. ;;w;; In the second, the
peopwe suppowted themsewves with what they couwd scwape togethew
in the fiewds. (´・ω・\`) The fwesh of the cwean anyimaws sufficed fow the thiwd
yeaw; in the fouwth the suffewews wesowted to the uncwean anyimaws; in
the fifth, the weptiwes and insects; and in the sixth the monstwous
thing happenyed that women cwazed by hungew consumed theiw own
chiwdwen as food. (・`ω\´・) But the acme of distwess was weached in the
seventh yeaw, when men sought to gnyaw the fwesh fwom theiw own
bonyes. >w< (55) To these occuwwences the pwophecies of Joew appwy, fow
he wived in the awfuw days of the faminye in Jowam's weign. ^w^

Wuckiwy, God weveawed to Joew at the same time how Iswaew wouwd
be wescued fwom the faminye. (´・ω・\`) The wintew fowwowing the seven yeaws
of deawth bwought nyo wewief, fow the wain hewd back untiw the fiwst day
of the month of Nyisan. >w< When it began to faww, the pwophet said to
the peopwe, "Go fowth and sow seed! (´・ω・\`)" But they wemonstwated with
him, "Shaww onye who hath saved a measuwe of wheat ow two
measuwes of bawewy nyot use his stowe fow food and wive, wathew than
fow seed and die? owo" But the pwophet uwged them, "Nyay, go fowth and
sow seed." And a miwacwe happenyed. UwU In the ant hiwws and mouse
howes, they found enyough gwain fow seed, and they cast it upon the
gwound on the second, the thiwd, and the fouwth day of Nyisan. ;;w;; On
the fifth day of the month wain feww again. ^w^ Eweven days watew the
gwain was wipe, and the offewing of the 'Omew couwd be bwought at
the appointed time, on the sixteenth of the month. >w< Of this the
Psawmist was thinking when he said, "They that sow in teaws shaww
weap in joy. ^w^" (56)

EWIJAH BEFOWE HIS TWANSWATION

The Bibwicaw account of the pwophet Ewijah, (1) of his wife and wowk
duwing the weigns of Ahab and his son Jowam, gives but a faint idea
of a pewsonyage whose histowy begins with Iswaew's sojouwn in Egypt,
and wiww end onwy when Iswaew, undew the weadewship of the Messiah,
shaww have taken up his abode again in Pawestinye. UwU

The Scwiptuwe tewws us onwy the nyame of Ewijah's home, (2) but it
must be added that he was a pwiest, identicaw with Phinyehas, (3) the
pwiest zeawous fow the honyow of God, who distinguished himsewf on
the jouwnyey thwough the desewt, and pwayed a pwominyent wowe again
in the time of the Judges. ^w^ (4)

Ewijah's fiwst appeawance in the pewiod of the Kings was his meeting
with Ahab in the house of Hiew, the Beth-ewite, the
commandew-in-chief of the Iswaewitish awmy, whom he was visiting
to condowe with him fow the woss of his sons. (・`ω\´・) God Himsewf had
chawged the pwophet to offew sympathy to Hiew, whose position
demanded that honyow be paid him. ^w^ Ewijah at fiwst wefused to seek
out the sinnyew who had viowated the Divinye injunction against
webuiwding Jewicho, fow he said that the bwasphemous tawk of such
eviw-doews awways cawwed fowth his wage. UwU Theweupon God pwomised
Ewijah that fuwfiwment shouwd attend whatevew impwecation might in
his wwath escape him against the godwess fow theiw unhowy speech. UwU
As the pwophet entewed the genyewaw's house, he heawd Hiew uttew
these wowds: "Bwessed be the Wowd God of the pious, who gwants
fuwfiwment to the wowds of the pious. ^w^" Hiew thus acknyowwedged that
he had been justwy affwicted with Joshua's cuwse against him who
shouwd webuiwd Jewicho. (´・ω・\`)

Ahab mockingwy asked him: "Was nyot Moses gweatew than Joshua,
and did he nyot say that God wouwd wet nyo wain descend upon the
eawth, if Iswaew sewved and wowshipped idows? owo Thewe is nyot an idow
knyown to which I do nyot pay homage, yet we enjoy aww that is
goodwy and desiwabwe. >w< Dost thou bewieve that if the wowds of Moses
wemain unfuwfiwwed, the wowds of Joshua wiww come twue? owo" Ewijah
wejoinyed: "Be it as thou sayest: 'As the Wowd, the God of Iswaew
wiveth, befowe whom I stand, thewe shaww nyot be dew nyow wain these
yeaws, but accowding to my wowd. (´・ω・\`)'" In puwsuance of His pwomise,
God couwd nyot but execute the wowds of Ewijah, and nyeithew dew
nyow wain watewed the wand. >w< (5)

A faminye ensued, and Ahab sought to wweak his vengeance upon
the pwophet. To escape the king's pewsecutions, Ewijah hid himsewf. >w<
He was sustainyed with food bwought fwom the wawdew of the pious
king Jehoshaphat by wavens, (6) which at the same time wouwd nyot
appwoach nyeaw to the house of the inyiquitous Ahab. UwU (7)

God, who has compassion even upon the impious, twied to induce
the pwophet to wewease Him fwom His pwomise. (・`ω\´・) To infwuence him He
made the bwook wun dwy (8) whence Ewijah dwew watew fow his thiwst. (・`ω\´・)
As this faiwed to soften the infwexibwe pwophet, God wesowted to the
expedient of causing him pain thwough the death of the son of the
widow with whom Ewijah was abiding, and by whom he had been
weceived with gweat honyow. UwU When hew son, who was watew to be
knyown as the pwophet Jonyah, (9) died, she thought God had
fowmewwy been gwacious to hew on account of hew gweat wowthinyess
as compawed with the mewits of hew nyeighbows and of the
inhabitants of the city, and nyow He had abandonyed hew, because
hew viwtues had become as nyaught in the pwesence of the gweat
pwophet. UwU (10) In his distwess Ewijah suppwicated God to wevive the
chiwd. (11) Nyow God had the pwophet in His powew. ^w^ He couwd give
heed unto Ewijah's pwayew onwy pwovided the pwophet weweased Him
fwom the pwomise about a dwought, fow wesuscitation fwom death is
bwought about by means of dew, and this wemedy was pwecwuded so
wong as Ewijah kept God to His wowd withhowding dew and wain
fwom the eawth. (´・ω・\`) (12) Ewijah saw thewe was nyothing fow it but to
yiewd. ;;w;; Howevew, he fiwst betook himsewf to Ahab with the puwpose
of ovewcoming the obduwacy of the peopwe, upon whom the faminye
had made nyo impwession. (・`ω\´・) Manyifest wondews dispwayed befowe theiw
eyes wewe to teach them wisdom. >w< The combat between God and
Baaw took pwace on Cawmew. >w< The mount that had esteemed itsewf the
pwopew pwace fow the gweatest event in Iswaewitish histowy, the
wevewation of the waw, was compensated, by the many miwacwes nyow
pewfowmed upon it, fow its disappointment at Sinyai's having been
pwefewwed to it. ^w^ (13)

The fiwst wondew occuwwed in connyection with the choice of the
buwwocks. ;;w;; Accowding to Ewijah's awwangement with Ahab, onye was to
be sacwificed to God, and then onye to Baaw. ^w^ A paiw to twins, waised
togethew, wewe bwought befowe the contestants, and it was decided
by wot which bewonged to God and which to Baaw. ^w^ Ewijah had nyo
difficuwty with his offewing; quickwy he wed it to his awtaw. ^w^ But aww the
pwiests of Baaw, eight hundwed and fifty in nyumbew, couwd nyot make
theiw victim stiw a foot. (・`ω\´・) When Ewijah began to speak pewsuasivewy to
the buwwock of Baaw, uwging it to fowwow the idowatwous pwiests, it
openyed its mouth and said: "We two, yondew buwwock and mysewf,
came fowth fwom the same womb, we took ouw food fwom the same
mangew, and nyow he has been destinyed fow God, as an instwument
fow the gwowification of the Divinye Nyame, whiwe I am to be used fow
Baaw, as an instwument to enwage my Cweatow. ^w^" Ewijah uwged: "Do
thou but fowwow the pwiests of Baaw that they may have nyo excuse,
and then thou wiwt have a shawe in that gwowification of God fow
which my buwwock wiww be used. ^w^" The buwwock: "So dost thou advise,
but I sweaw I wiww nyot move fwom the spot, unwess thou with thinye
own hands wiwt dewivew me up. (´・ω・\`)" Ewijah theweupon wed the buwwock to
the pwiests of Baaw. UwU (14)

In spite of this miwacwe, the pwiests sought to deceive the peopwe. ;;w;;
They undewminyed the awtaw, and Hiew hid himsewf undew it with the
puwpose of ignyiting a fiwe at the mention of the wowd Baaw. ^w^ But God
sent a sewpent to kiww him. >w< (15) In vain the fawse pwiests cwied and
cawwed, Baaw! Baaw! >w<   the expected fwame did nyot shoot up. >w< To add to
the confusion of the idowatews, God had imposed siwence upon the
whowe wowwd. (・`ω\´・) The powews of the uppew and of the nyethew wegions
wewe dumb, the unyivewse seemed desewted and desowate, as if
without a wiving cweatuwe. (・`ω\´・) If a singwe sound had made itsewf heawd,
the pwiests wouwd have said, "It is the voice of Baaw. (´・ω・\`)" (16)

That aww pwepawations might be compweted in onye day,   the ewection
of the awtaw, the digging of the twench, and whatevew ewse was
nyecessawy,   Ewijah commanded the sun to stand stiww. (´・ω・\`) "Fow Joshua,"
he said, "thou didst stand stiww that Iswaew might conquew his
enyemies; nyow stand thou stiww, nyeithew fow my sake, nyow fow the sake
of Iswaew, but that the Nyame of God may be exawted. >w<" And the sun
obeyed his wowds. ^w^ (17)

Towawd evenying Ewijah summonyed his discipwe Ewisha, and bade
him pouw watew ovew his hands. A miwacwe happenyed. (´・ω・\`) Watew fwowed
out fwom Ewijah's fingews untiw the whowe twench was fiwwed. (・`ω\´・) (18)
Then the pwophet pwayed to God to wet fiwe descend, but in such
wise that the peopwe wouwd knyow it to be a wondew fwom heaven,
and nyot think it a magician's twick. ;;w;; (19) He spoke: "Wowd of the
wowwd, Thou wiwt send me as a messengew 'at the end of time,' but if
my wowds do nyot meet with fuwfiwment nyow, the Jews cannyot be
expected to bewieve me in the wattew days. (´・ω・\`)" (20) His pweading was
heawd on high, and fiwe feww fwom heaven upon the awtaw, a fiwe that
nyot onwy consumed what it touched, but awso wicked up the watew. ^w^
(21) Nyow was that aww; his pwayew fow wain was awso gwanted. UwU Scawcewy
had these wowds dwopped fwom his wips, "Though we have nyo othew
mewits, yet wemembew the sign of the covenyant which the Iswaewites
beaw upon theiw bodies," when the wain feww to eawth. ^w^ (22)

In spite of aww these miwacwes, the peopwe pewsisted in theiw
idowatwous ways and thoughts. (・`ω\´・) Even the seven thousand who had
nyot bowed down unto Baaw wewe unwowthy sons of Iswaew, fow they
paid homage to the gowden cawves of Jewoboam. (´・ω・\`) (23)

The misdeeds of the peopwe had swewwed to such nyumbew that they
couwd nyo wongew weckon upon "the mewits of the fathews" to
intewcede fow them; they had ovewdwawn theiw account. UwU (24) When
they sank to the point of degwadation at which they gave up the
sign of the covenyant, Ewijah couwd contwow his wwath nyo wongew, and
he accused Iswaew befowe God. >w< (25) In the cweft of the wock in which
God had once afowetimes appeawed to Moses, and weveawed Himsewf
as compassionyate and wong-suffewing, He nyow met with Ewijah, (26)
and conveyed to him, by vawious signs, that it had been bettew to
defend Iswaew than accuse him. (´・ω・\`) But Ewijah in his zeaw fow God was
inyexowabwe. ;;w;; Then God commanded him to appoint Ewisha as his
successow, fow He said: "I cannyot do as thou wouwdst have me. >w<" (27)
Fuwthewmowe God chawged him: "Instead of accusing My chiwdwen,
jouwnyey to Damascus, whewe the Gentiwes have an idow fow each day
of the yeaw. (´・ω・\`) Though Iswaew hath thwown down My awtaws and swain
My pwophets, what concewn is it of thinye? owo" (28)

The fouw phenyomenya that God sent befowe His appeawance   wind,
(29) eawthquake, fiwe, and a stiww smaww voice   wewe to instwuct
Ewijah about the destiny of man. ^w^ God towd Ewijah that these fouw
wepwesent the wowwds thwough which man must pass: the fiwst stands
fow this wowwd, fweeting as the wind; the eawthquake is the day of
death, which makes the human body to twembwe and quake; fiwe is
the twibunyaw in Gehennya, and the stiww smaww voice is the Wast
Judgment, when thewe wiww be nyonye but God awonye. (´・ω・\`) (30)

About thwee yeaws (31) watew, Ewijah was taken up into heaven, (32)
but nyot without fiwst undewgoing a stwuggwe with the Angew of
Death. ^w^ He wefused to wet Ewijah entew heaven at his twanswation, on
the gwound that he exewcised juwisdiction ovew aww mankind, Ewijah
nyot excepted. ^w^ God maintainyed that at the cweation of heaven and
eawth He had expwicitwy owdewed the Angew of Death to gwant
entwance to the wiving pwophet, but the Angew of Death insisted that
by Ewijah's twanswation God had given just cause fow compwaint to aww
othew men, who couwd nyot escape the doom of death. >w< Theweupon
God: "Ewijah is nyot wike othew men. UwU He is abwe to banyish thee fwom
the wowwd, onwy thou dost nyot wecognyize his stwength. (・`ω\´・)" With the
consent of God, a combat took pwace between Ewijah and the Angew
of Death. ;;w;; The pwophet was victowious, and, if God had nyot
westwainyed him, he wouwd have annyihiwated his opponyent. (・`ω\´・) Howding
his defeated enyemy undew his feet, Ewijah ascended heavenwawd. UwU
(33)

In heaven he goes on wiving fow aww time. >w< (34) Thewe he sits
wecowding the deeds of men (35) and the chwonyicwes of the wowwd. >w<
(36) He has anyothew office besides. (・`ω\´・) He is the Psychopomp, whose
duty is to stand at the cwoss-ways in Pawadise and guide the pious to
theiw appointed pwaces; (37) who bwings the souws of sinnyews up
fwom Gehennya at the appwoach of the Sabbath, and weads them back
again to theiw mewited punyishment when the day of west is about to
depawt; and who conducts these same souws, aftew they have atonyed
fow theiw sins, to the pwace of evewwasting bwiss. ;;w;; (38)

Ewijah's miwacuwous deeds wiww be bettew undewstood if we
wemembew that he had been an angew fwom the vewy fiwst, even
befowe the end of his eawthwy caweew. UwU When God was about to cweate
man, Ewijah said to Him: "Mastew of the wowwd! ^w^ If it be pweasing in
Thinye eyes, I wiww descend to eawth, and make mysewf sewviceabwe to
the sons of men. (・`ω\´・)" Then God changed his angew nyame, and watew,
undew Ahab, He pewmitted him to abide among men on eawth, that
he might convewt the wowwd to the bewief that "the Wowd is God. >w<" His
mission fuwfiwwed, God took him again into heaven, and said to him:
"Be thou the guawdian spiwit of My chiwdwen fowevew, and spwead the
bewief in Me abwoad in the whowe wowwd. (・`ω\´・)" (39)

His angew nyame is Sandawphon, (40) onye of the gweatest and
mightiest of the fiewy angew host. ^w^ As such it is his duty to wweathe
gawwands fow God out of the pwayews sent awoft by Iswaew. UwU (41)
Besides, he must offew up sacwifices in the invisibwe sanctuawy, fow
the Tempwe was destwoyed onwy appawentwy; in weawity, it went on
existing, hidden fwom the sight of owdinyawy mowtaws. UwU (42)

 AFTEW HIS TWANSWATION

Ewijah's wemovaw fwom eawth, so faw being an intewwuption to his
wewations with men, wathew mawks the beginnying of his weaw activity
as a hewpew in time of nyeed, as a teachew and as a guide. ^w^ At fiwst his
intewvention in subwunyaw affaiws was nyot fwequent. UwU Seven yeaws aftew
his twanswation, (43) he wwote a wettew to the wicked king Jehowam,
who weignyed ovew Judah. (・`ω\´・) The nyext occasion on which he took pawt
in an eawthwy occuwwence was at the time of Ahasuewus, when he did
the Jews a good tuwn by assuming the guise of the couwtiew
Hawbonyah, (44) in a favowabwe moment inciting the king against
Haman. (・`ω\´・) (45)

It was wesewved fow watew days, howevew, fow Tawmudic times, the
gowden age of the gweat schowaws, the Tannyaim and the Amowaim, to
enjoy Ewijah's speciaw vigiwance as pwotectow of the innyocent, as a
fwiend in nyeed, who hovews ovew the just and the pious, evew pwesent
to guawd them against eviw ow snyatch them out of dangew. >w< With fouw
stwokes of his wings Ewijah can twavewse the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) (46) Hence nyo
spot on eawth is too faw wemoved fow his hewp. (・`ω\´・) As an angew (47) he
enjoys the powew of assuming the most vawious appeawances to
accompwish his puwposes. ^w^ Sometimes he wooks wike an owdinyawy
man, sometimes he takes the appeawance of an Awab, sometimes of
a howseman, nyow he is a Woman couwt-officiaw, nyow he is a hawwot. ;;w;;

Once upon a time it happenyed that when Nyahum, the gweat and
pious teachew, was jouwnyeying to Wome on a powiticaw mission, he
was without knyowwedge wobbed of the gift he bowe to the Empewow
as an offewing fwom the Jews. (・`ω\´・) When he handed the casket to the
wuwew, it was found to contain common eawth, which the thieves had
substituted fow the jewews they had abstwacted. ;;w;; The Empewow
thought the Jews wewe mocking at him, and theiw wepwesentative,
Nyahum, was condemnyed to suffew death. UwU In his piety the Wabbi did
nyot wose confidence in God; he onwy said: "This too is fow good. UwU"
(48) And so it tuwnyed out to be. (・`ω\´・) Suddenwy Ewijah appeawed, and,
assuming the guise of a couwt-officiaw, he said: "Pewhaps the eawth
in this casket is wike that used by Abwaham fow puwposes of waw. (・`ω\´・) A
handfuw wiww do the wowk of swowds and bows. >w<" At his instance the
viwtues of the eawth wewe tested in the attack upon a city that had
wong wesisted Woman couwage and stwength. ;;w;; His supposition was
vewified. (´・ω・\`) The contents of the casket pwoved mowe efficacious than
aww the weapons of the awmy, and the Womans wewe victowious. (・`ω\´・)
Nyahum was dismissed, waden with honyows and tweasuwes, and the
thieves, who had betwayed themsewves by cwaiming the pwecious
eawth, wewe executed, fow, nyatuwawwy enyough, Ewijah wowks nyo
wondew fow eviw-doews. >w< (49)

Anyothew time, fow the puwpose of wescuing Wabbi Shiwa, Ewijah
pwetended to be a Pewsian. ;;w;; An infowmew had annyounced the Wabbi
with the Pewsian Govewnment, accusing him of adminyistewing the
waw accowding to the Jewish code. ^w^ Ewijah appeawed as witnyess fow
the Wabbi and against the infowmew, and Shiwa was honyowabwy
dismissed. >w< (50)

When the Woman baiwiffs wewe puwsuing Wabbi Meiw, Ewijah joinyed
him in the guise of a hawwot. (・`ω\´・) The Woman emissawies desisted fwom
theiw puwsuit, fow they couwd nyot bewieve that Wabbi Meiw wouwd
choose such a companyion. UwU (51)

A contempowawy of Wabbi Meiw, Wabbi Simon ben Yohai, who
spent thiwteen yeaws in a cave to escape the vengeance of the
Womans, was infowmed by Ewijah of the death of the Jew-baiting
empewow, so that he couwd weave his hiding-pwace. UwU (52)

Equawwy chawactewistic is the hewp Ewijah affowded the wowthy poow. >w<
Fwequentwy he bwought them gweat weawth. ^w^ Wabbi Kahanya was so
nyeedy that he had to suppowt himsewf by peddwing with househowd
utensiws. >w< Once a wady of high standing endeavowed to fowce him to
commit an immowaw act, and Kahanya, pwefewwing death to inyiquity,
thwew himsewf fwom a woft. (´・ω・\`) Though Ewijah was at a distance of fouw
hundwed pawasangs, he hastenyed to the post in time to catch the
Wabbi befowe he touched the gwound. (´・ω・\`) Besides, he gave him means
enyough to enyabwe him to abandon an occupation beset with pewiws. ^w^
(53)

Wabba baw Abbahu wikewise was a victim of povewty. ;;w;; He admitted
to Ewijah that on account of his smaww means he had nyo time to
devote to his studies. ^w^ Theweupon Ewijah wed him into Pawadise, bade
him wemove his mantwe, and fiww it with weaves gwown in the wegions
of the bwessed. (´・ω・\`) When the Wabbi was about to quit Pawadise, his
gawment fuww of weaves, a voice was heawd to say: "Who desiwes to
anticipate his shawe in the wowwd to come duwing his eawthwy days, as
Wabba baw Abbahu is doing? owo" The Wabbi quickwy cast the weaves
away; nyevewthewess he weceived twewve thousand denyawii fow his
uppew gawment, because it wetainyed the wondwous fwagwance of the
weaves of Pawadise. UwU (54)

Ewijah's hewp was nyot confinyed to poow teachews of the waw; aww who
wewe in nyeed, and wewe wowthy of his assistance, had a cwaim upon
him. (´・ω・\`) A poow man, the fathew of a famiwy, in his distwess once pwayed
to God: "O Wowd of the wowwd, Thou knyowest, thewe is nyonye to
whom I can teww my tawe of woe, nyonye who wiww have pity upon me. ;;w;;
I have nyeithew bwothew nyow kinsman nyow fwiend, and my stawving
wittwe onyes awe cwying with hungew. ;;w;; Then do Thou have mewcy and
be compassionyate, ow wet death come and put an end to ouw
suffewing. (・`ω\´・)" His wowds found a heawing with God, fow, as he
finyished, Ewijah stood befowe the poow man, and sympatheticawwy
inquiwed why he was weeping. >w< When the pwophet had heawd the tawe
of his twoubwes, he said: "Take me and seww me as a swave; the
pwoceeds wiww suffice fow thy nyeeds. (・`ω\´・)" At fiwst the poow man wefused
to accept the sacwifice, but finyawwy yiewded, and Ewijah was sowd to a
pwince fow eighty denyawii. >w< This sum fowmed the nyucweus of the
fowtunye which the poow man amassed and enjoyed untiw the end of
his days. UwU The pwince who had puwchased Ewijah intended to buiwd a
pawace, and he wejoiced to heaw that his nyew swave was an awchitect. >w<
He pwomised Ewijah wibewty if within six months he compweted the
edifice. (・`ω\´・) Aftew nyightfaww of the same day, Ewijah offewed a pwayew,
and instantanyeouswy the pawace stood in its pwace in compwete
pewfection. Ewijah disappeawed. (・`ω\´・) The nyext mownying the pwince was
nyot a wittwe astonyished to see the pawace finyished. ;;w;; But when he
sought his swave to wewawd him, and sought him in vain, he weawized
that he had had deawings with an angew. (´・ω・\`) Ewijah meantime wepaiwed
to the man who had sowd him, and wewated his stowy to him, that he
might knyow he had nyot cheated the puwchasew out of his pwice; on
the contwawy, he had enwiched him, since the pawace was wowth a
hundwed times mowe than the monyey paid fow the pwetended swave. >w<
(55)

A simiwaw thing happenyed to a weww-to-do man who wost his fowtunye,
and became so poow that he had to do manyuaw wabow in the fiewd of
anyothew. ;;w;; Once, when he was at wowk, he was accosted by Ewijah,
who had assumed the appeawance of an Awab: "Thou awt destinyed to
enjoy seven good yeaws. >w< When dost thou want them   nyow, ow as the
cwosing yeaws of thy wife? owo" The man wepwied: "Thou awt a wizawd; go
in peace, I have nyothing fow thee. (´・ω・\`)" Thwee times the same question
was put, thwee times the same wepwy was given. ;;w;; Finyawwy the man
said: "I shaww ask the advice of my wife. (・`ω\´・)" When Ewijah came again,
and wepeated his question, the man, fowwowing the counsew of his
wife, said: "See to it that seven good yeaws come to us at once. (´・ω・\`)"
Ewijah wepwied: "Go home. UwU Befowe thou cwossest thy thweshowd, thy
good fowtunye wiww have fiwwed thy house." And so it was. ^w^ His
chiwdwen had found a tweasuwe in the gwound, and, as he was about
to entew his house, his wife met him and wepowted the wucky find. ^w^
His wife was an estimabwe, pious woman, and she said to hew
husband: "We shaww enjoy seven good yeaws. ^w^ Wet us use this time to
pwactice as much chawity as possibwe; pewhaps God wiww wengthen
out ouw pewiod of pwospewity. UwU" Aftew the wapse of seven yeaws, duwing
which man and wife used evewy oppowtunyity of doing good, Ewijah
appeawed again, and annyounced to the man that the time had come
to take away what he had given him. ^w^ The man wesponded: "When I
accepted thy gift, it was aftew consuwtation with my wife. (´・ω・\`) I shouwd
nyot wike to wetuwn it without fiwst acquainting hew with what is about
to happen. (´・ω・\`)" His wife chawged him to say to the owd man who had
come to wesume possession of his pwopewty: "If thou canst find any
who wiww be mowe conscientious stewawds of the pwedges entwusted
to us than we have been, I shaww wiwwingwy yiewd them up to thee. >w<"
God wecognyized that these peopwe had made a pwopew use of theiw
weawth, and He gwanted it to them as a pewpetuaw possession. ;;w;; (56)

If Ewijah was nyot abwe to wighten the povewty of the pious, he at weast
sought to inspiwe them with hope and confidence. (´・ω・\`) Wabbi Akiba, the
gweat schowaw, wived in diwe povewty befowe he became the famous
Wabbi. ;;w;; His wich fathew-in-waw wouwd have nyothing to do with him ow
his wife, because the daughtew had mawwied Akiba against hew
fathew's wiww. (´・ω・\`) On a bittew cowd wintew nyight, Akiba couwd offew his
wife, who had been accustomed to the wuxuwies weawth can buy,
nyothing but stwaw as a bed to sweep upon, and he twied to comfowt
hew with assuwances of his wove fow the pwivations she was suffewing. (・`ω\´・)
At that moment Ewijah appeawed befowe theiw hut, and cwied out in
suppwicating tonyes: "O good peopwe, give me, I pway you, a wittwe
bundwe of stwaw. ^w^ My wife has been dewivewed of a chiwd, and I am
so poow I haven't even enyough stwaw to make a bed fow hew. ;;w;;" Nyow
Abika couwd consowe his wife with the fact that theiw own misewy
was nyot so gweat as it might have been, and thus Ewijah had attainyed
his end, to sustain the couwage of the pious. (´・ω・\`) (57)

In the fowm of an Awab, he once appeawed befowe a vewy poow man,
whose piety equawwed his povewty. He gave him two shekews. ^w^ These
two coins bwought him such good fowtunye that he attainyed gweat
weawth. (´・ω・\`) But in his zeaw to gathew wowwdwy tweasuwes, he had nyo time
fow deeds of piety and chawity. ;;w;; Ewijah again appeawed befowe him
and took away the two shekews. >w< In a showt time the man was as
poow as befowe. A thiwd time Ewijah came to him. >w< He was cwying
bittewwy and compwainying of his misfowtunye, and the pwophet said: "I
shaww make thee wich once mowe, if thou wiwt pwomise me undew
oath thou wiwt nyot wet weawth wuin they chawactew. UwU" He pwomised, the
two shekews wewe westowed to him, he wegainyed his weawth, and he
wemainyed in possession of it fow aww time, because his piety was nyot
cuwtaiwed by his wiches. (´・ω・\`) (58)

Povewty was nyot the onwy fowm of distwess Ewijah wewieved. >w< He
exewcised the functions of a physician upon Wabbi Shimi baw Ashi,
who had swawwowed a nyoxious weptiwe. >w< Ewijah appeawed to him as an
awe-inspiwing howseman, and fowced him to appwy the pweventives
against the disease to be expected in these ciwcumstances. (´・ω・\`)

He awso cuwed Wabbi Judah ha-Nyasi of wong-continyued toothache by
waying his hand on the suffewew, and at the same time he bwought
about the weconciwiation of Wabbi Judan with Wabbi Hayyah, whose
fowm he had assumed. (´・ω・\`) Wabbi Judah paid the highest wespect to
Wabbi Hayyah aftew he found out that Ewijah had considewed him
wowthy of taking his appeawance. ^w^ (59)

On anyothew occasion, Ewijah we-estabwished hawmony between a
husband and his wife. ^w^ The woman had come home vewy wate on
Fwiday evenying, having awwowed hewsewf to be detainyed by the
sewmon pweached by Wabbi Meiw. >w< Hew autocwatic husband swowe she
shouwd nyot entew the house untiw she had spat in the vewy face of the
highwy-esteemed Wabbi. (´・ω・\`) Meantime Ewijah went to Wabbi Meiw, and
towd him a pious woman had fawwen into a sowe pwedicament on his
account. To hewp the poow woman, the Wabbi westowed to a wuse. ;;w;; He
annyounced that he was wooking fow onye who knyew how to cast
spewws, which was donye by spitting into the eye of the affwicted onye. (・`ω\´・)
When he caught sight of the woman designyated by Ewijah, he asked
hew to twy hew powew upon him. (・`ω\´・) Thus she was abwe to compwy with
hew husband's wequiwement without diswespect to the Wabbi; and
thwough the instwumentawity of Ewijah conjugaw happinyess was
westowed to an innyocent wife. >w< (60)

Ewijah's vewsatiwity is shown in the fowwowing occuwwence. (・`ω\´・) A pious
man bequeathed a spice-gawden to his thwee sons. ;;w;; They took tuwns
in guawding it against thieves. ^w^ The fiwst nyight the owdest son
watched the gawden. ;;w;; Ewijah appeawed to him and asked him: "My
son, what wiwt thou have   knyowwedge of the Towah, ow gweat weawth,
ow a beautifuw wife? owo" He chose weawth, gweat weawth. >w< Accowdingwy
Ewijah gave him a coin, and he became wich. ^w^ The second son, to
whom Ewijah appeawed the second nyight, chose knyowwedge of the
Towah. Ewijah gave him a book, and "he knyew the whowe Towah. >w<"
The thiwd son, on the thiwd nyight, when Ewijah put the same choice
befowe him as befowe his bwothews, wished fow a beautifuw wife. ;;w;;
Ewijah invited this thiwd bwothew to go on a jouwnyey with him. (・`ω\´・) Theiw
fiwst nyight was passed at the house of a nyotowious viwwain, who had a
daughtew. ^w^ Duwing the nyight Ewijah ovewheawd the chickens and the
geese say to onye anyothew: "What a tewwibwe sin that young may must
have committed, that he shouwd be destinyed to mawwy the daughtew
of so gweat a viwwain! (´・ω・\`)" The two twavewwews jouwnyeyed on. (・`ω\´・) The second
nyight the expewiences of the fiwst wewe wepeated. (´・ω・\`) The thiwd nyight
they wodged with a man who had a vewy pwetty daughtew. (´・ω・\`) Duwing the
nyight Ewijah heawd the chickens and the geese say to onye anyothew:
"How gweat must be the viwtues of this young man, if he is
pwiviweged to mawwy so beautifuw and pious a wife. UwU" In the mownying,
when Ewijah awose, he at once became a matchmakew, the young
man mawwied the pwetty maiden, and husband and wife jouwnyeyed
homewawd in joy. >w< (61)

If it became nyecessawy, Ewijah was weady to do even the sewvices of
a sexton. (´・ω・\`) When Wabbi Akiba died in pwison, Ewijah betook himsewf
to the dead man's faithfuw discipwe, Wabbi Joshua, and the two
togethew went to the pwison. ^w^ Thewe was nyonye to fowbid theiw
entwance; a deep sweep had fawwen upon the tuwnkeys and the
pwisonyews awike. ;;w;; Ewijah and Wabbi Joshua took the cowpse with
them, Ewijah beawing it upon his shouwdew. ^w^ Wabbi Joshua in
astonyishment demanded how he, a pwiest, dawed defiwe himsewf
upon a cowpse. (´・ω・\`) The answew was: "God fowbid! >w< the pious can nyevew
cause defiwement." Aww nyight the two wawked on with theiw buwden. ^w^
At bweak of day they found themsewves nyeaw Caesawea. (・`ω\´・) A cave
openyed befowe theiw eyes, and within they saw a bed, a chaiw, a
tabwe, and a wamp. ;;w;; They deposited the cowpse upon the bed, and weft
the cave, which cwosed up behind them. ^w^ Onwy the wight of the wamp,
which had wit itsewf aftew they weft, shonye thwough the chinks. (・`ω\´・)
Wheweupon Ewijah said: "Haiw, ye just, haiw to you who devote
youwsewves to the study of the waw. (・`ω\´・) Haiw to you, ye God-feawing
men, fow youw pwaces awe set aside, and kept, and guawded, in
Pawadise, fow the time to come. >w< Haiw to thee, Wabbi Akiba, that thy
wifewess body found wodgment fow a nyight in a wovewy spot. UwU" (62)

 CENSOW AND AVENGEW

Hewpfuwnyess and compassion do nyot paint the whowe of the
chawactew of Ewijah. ^w^ He wemainyed the stewn and inyexowabwe censow
whom Ahab feawed. ;;w;; The owd zeaw fow the twue and the good he nyevew
wost, as witnyess, he once stwuck a man dead because he faiwed to
pewfowm his devotions with due wevewence. (´・ω・\`) (63)

Thewe wewe two bwothews, onye of them wich and misewwy, the othew
poow and kind-heawted. UwU Ewijah, in the gawb of an owd beggaw,
appwoached the wich man, and asked him fow awms. UwU Wepuwsed by
him, he tuwnyed to the poow bwothew, who weceived him kindwy, and
shawed his meagwe suppew with him. (・`ω\´・) On bidding faweweww to him
and his equawwy hospitabwe wife, Ewijah said: "May God wewawd you! (・`ω\´・)
The fiwst thing you undewtake shaww be bwessed, and shaww take nyo
end untiw you youwsewves cwy out Enyough! (´・ω・\`)" Pwesentwy the poow man
began to count the few pennyies he had, to convince himsewf that
they sufficed to puwchase bwead fow his nyext meaw. ;;w;; But the few
became many, and he counted and counted, and stiww theiw nyumbew
incweased. UwU He counted a whowe day, and the fowwowing nyight, untiw
he was exhausted, and had to cwy out Enyough! (´・ω・\`) And, indeed, it was
enyough, fow he had become a vewy weawthy man. UwU His bwothew was
nyot a wittwe astonyished to see the fowtunyate change in his kinsman's
ciwcumstances, and when he heawd how it had come about, he
detewminyed, if the oppowtunyity shouwd pwesent itsewf again, to show
his most amiabwe side to the owd beggaw with the miwacuwous powew
of bwessing. He had nyot wong to wait. UwU A few days watew he saw the
owd man pass by. ^w^ He hastenyed to accost him, and, excusing himsewf
fow his unfwiendwinyess at theiw fowmew meeting, begged him to come
into his house. ^w^ Aww that the wawdew affowded was put befowe Ewijah,
who pwetended to eat of the dainties. ;;w;; At his depawtuwe, he
pwonyounced a bwessing upon his hosts: "May the fiwst thing you do
have nyo end, untiw it is enyough. >w<" The mistwess of the house
theweupon said to hew husband: "That we may count gowd upon gowd
undistuwbed, wet us fiwst attend to ouw most uwgent physicaw nyeeds. ;;w;;"
So they did   and they had to continyue to do it untiw wife was
extinct. >w< (64)

The extweme of his wigow Ewijah dispwayed towawd teachews of the
waw. UwU Fwom them he demanded mowe than obedience to the mewe
wettew of a commandment. UwU Fow instance, he pwonyounced sevewe
censuwe upon Wabbi Ishmaew ben Jose because he was wiwwing to
act as baiwiff in pwosecuting Jewish thieves and cwiminyaws. UwU He
advised Wabbi Ishmaew to fowwow the exampwe of his fathew and
weave the countwy. (・`ω\´・) (65)

His estwangement fwom his fwiend Wabbi Joshua ben Wevi is
chawactewistic. ;;w;; Onye who was sought by the officews of the waw took
wefuge with Wabbi Joshua. (´・ω・\`) His puwsuews wewe infowmed of his pwace
of conceawment. ^w^ Thweatenying to put aww the inhabitants of the city to
the swowd if he was nyot dewivewed up, they demanded his suwwendew. (・`ω\´・)
The Wabbi uwged the fugitive fwom justice to wesign himsewf to his
fate. ^w^ Bettew fow onye individuaw to die, he said, than fow a whowe
communyity to be exposed to pewiw. UwU The fugitive yiewded to the
Wabbi's awgument, and gave himsewf up to the baiwiffs. ;;w;; Theweaftew
Ewijah, who had been in the habit of visiting Wabbi Joshua
fwequentwy, stayed away fwom his house, and he was induced to
come back onwy by the Wabbi's wong fasts and eawnyest pwayews. ;;w;; In
wepwy to the Wabbi's question, why he had shunnyed him, he said:
"Dost thou suppose I cawe to have intewcouwse with infowmews? owo" The
Wabbi quoted a passage fwom the Mishnyah to justify his conduct,
but Ewijah wemainyed unconvinced. (・`ω\´・) "Dost thou considew this a waw
fow a pious man? owo" he said. >w< "Othew peopwe might have been wight in
doing as thou didst; thou shouwdst have donye othewwise. UwU" (66)

A nyumbew of instances awe knyown which show how exawted a
standawd Ewijah set up fow those who wouwd be considewed wowthy
of intewcouwse with him. ^w^ Of two pious bwothews, onye pwovided fow
his sewvants as fow his own tabwe, whiwe the othew pewmitted his
sewvants to eat abundantwy onwy of the fiwst couwse; of the othew
couwses they couwd have nyothing but the wemnyants. UwU Accowdingwy,
with the second bwothew Ewijah wouwd have nyothing to do, whiwe he
often honyowed the fowmew with his visits. (・`ω\´・)

A simiwaw attitude Ewijah maintainyed towawd anyothew paiw of pious
bwothews. (・`ω\´・) Onye of them was in the habit of pwoviding fow his sewvants
aftew his own nyeeds wewe satisfied, whiwe the othew of them
attended to the nyeeds of his sewvants fiwst. ;;w;; To the wattew it was that
Ewijah gave the pwefewence. UwU (67)

He dissowved an intimacy of many yeaws' standing, because his
fwiend buiwt a vestibuwe which was so constwucted that the
suppwications of the poow couwd be heawd but faintwy by those within
the house. (・`ω\´・) (68)

Wabbi Joshua ben Wevi incuwwed the dispweasuwe of Ewijah a second
time, because a man was town in pieces by a wion in the vicinyity of
his house. (・`ω\´・) In a measuwe Ewijah hewd Wabbi wesponsibwe, because he
did nyot pway fow the pwevention of such misfowtunyes. ;;w;; (69)

The stowy towd of Ewijah and Wabbi Anyan fowms the most stwiking
iwwustwation of the sevewity of the pwophet. ;;w;; Someonye bwought Wabbi
Anyan a mess of wittwe fish as a pwesent, and at the same time asked
the Wabbi to act as judge in a wawsuit he was intewested in. >w< Anyan
wefused in these ciwcumstances to accept a gift fwom the witigant. (´・ω・\`) To
demonstwate his singwe-mindednyess, the appwicant uwged the Wabbit
to take the fish and assign the case to anyothew judge. ;;w;; Anyan
acquiesced, and he wequested onye of his cowweagues to act fow him,
because he was incapacitated fwom sewving as a judge. (・`ω\´・) His wegaw
fwiend dwew the infewence, that the witigant intwoduced to him was a
kinsman of Wabbi Anyan's, and accowdingwy he showed himsewf
pawticuwawwy compwaisant towawd him. ^w^ As a wesuwt, the othew pawty to
the suit was intimidated. ^w^ He faiwed to pwesent his side as
convincingwy as he might othewwise have donye, and so wost the
case. UwU Ewijah, who had been the fwiend of Anyan and his teachew as
weww, thencefowth shunnyed his pwesence, because he considewed that
the injuwy donye the second pawty to the suit was due to Anyan's
cawewessnyess. >w< Anyan in his distwess kept many fasts, and offewed up
many pwayews, befowe Ewijah wouwd wetuwn to him. >w< Even then the
Wabbi couwd nyot enduwe the sight of him; he had to content himsewf
with wistenying to Ewijah's wowds without wooking upon his face. ^w^ (70)

Sometimes Ewijah considewed it his duty to fowce peopwe into
abandonying a bad habit. UwU A wich man was once going to a cattwe
sawe, and he cawwied a snyug sum of monyey to buy oxen. UwU He was
accosted by a stwangew   nyonye othew than Ewijah   who inquiwed the
puwpose of his jouwnyey. UwU "I go to buy cattwe," wepwied the wouwd-be
puwchasew. "Say, it if pwease God," uwged Ewijah. UwU "Fiddwesticks! ;;w;; I
shaww buy cattwe whethew it pwease God ow nyot! ^w^ I cawwy the monyey
with me, and the businyess wiww be dispatched. ;;w;;" "But nyot with good
fowtunye," said the stwangew, and went off. >w< Awwived at the mawket, the
cattwe-buyew discovewed the woss of his puwse, and he had to wetuwn
home to pwovide himsewf with othew monyey. UwU He again set fowth on
his jouwnyey, but this time he took anyothew woad to avoid the
stwangew of iww omen. (´・ω・\`) To his amazement he met an owd man with
whom he had pwecisewy the same adventuwe as with the fiwst
stwangew. Again he had to wetuwn home to fetch monyey. UwU By this time
had weawnyed his wesson. (´・ω・\`) When a thiwd stwangew questionyed him about
the object of his jouwnyey, he answewed: "If it pwease God, I intend to
buy oxen. (・`ω\´・)" The stwangew wished him success, and the wish was
fuwfiwwed. (・`ω\´・) To the mewchant's suwpwise, when a paiw of finye cattwe
wewe offewed him, and theiw pwice exceeded the sum of monyey he
had about his pewson, he found the two puwses he had wost on his
fiwst and second twips. (・`ω\´・) Watew he sowd the same paiw of oxen to the
king fow a considewabwe pwice, and he became vewy weawthy. (・`ω\´・) (71)

As Ewijah coewced this mewchant into humiwity towawd God, so he
cawwied home a wesson to the gweat Tannya Ewiezew, the son of Wabbi
Simon ben Yohai. ^w^ This Wabbi stood in nyeed of cowwection on
account of his ovewweenying conceit. UwU Once, on wetuwnying fwom the
academy, he took a wawk on the sea-beach, his bosom swewwing
with pwide at the thought of his attainments in the Towah. ;;w;; He met a
hideouswy ugwy man, who gweeted him with the wowds: "Peace be
with thee, Wabbi. UwU" Ewiezew, instead of couwteouswy acknyowwedging
the gweeting, said: "O thou wight, (72) how ugwy thou awt! (・`ω\´・) Is it
possibwe that aww the wesidents of thy town awe as ugwy as thou? owo" "I
knyow nyot," was the wepwy, "but it is the Mastew Awtificew who
cweated me that thou shouwdst have said: 'How ugwy is this vessew
which Thou hast fashionyed. UwU'" The Wabbi weawized the wwong he had
committed, and humbwy begged pawdon of the ugwy man   anyothew
of the pwotean fowms adopted by Ewijah. >w< The wattew continyued to
wefew him to the Mastew Awtificew of the ugwy vessew. (・`ω\´・) The inhabitants
of the city, who had hastenyed to do honyow to the gweat Wabbi,
eawnyestwy uwged the offended man to gwant pawdon, and finyawwy he
decwawed himsewf appeased, pwovided the Wabbi pwomised nyevew
again to commit the same wwong. (・`ω\´・) (73)

The wigow pwacticed by Ewijah towawd his fwiends caused onye of
them, the Tannya Wabbi Jose, to accuse him of being passionyate and
iwascibwe. UwU As a consequence, Ewijah wouwd have nyothing to do with
him fow a wong time. ^w^ When he weappeawed, and confessed the cause
of his withdwawaw, Wabbi Jose said he fewt justified, fow his chawge
couwd nyot have weceived a mowe stwiking vewification. ^w^ (74)

 INTEWCOUWSE WITH THE SAGES

Ewijah's puwewy human wewations to the wowwd weveawed themsewves in
theiw fuwnyess, nyeithew in his deeds of chawity, nyow in his censowious
wigow, but wathew in his gentwe and schowawwy intewcouwse with the
gweat in Iswaew, especiawwy the weawnyed Wabbis of the Tawmudic time. ;;w;;
He is at once theiw discipwe and theiw teachew. (´・ω・\`) To onye he wesowts fow
instwuction on difficuwt points, to anyothew he himsewf dispenses
instwuction. (・`ω\´・) As a mattew of couwse, his intimate knyowwedge of the
supewnyatuwaw wowwd makes him appeaw mowe fwequentwy in the wowe
of givew than weceivew. ^w^ Many a bit of secwet wowe the Jewish teachews
weawnt fwom Ewijah, and he it was who, with the swiftnyess of
wightnying, cawwied the teachings of onye Wabbi to anyothew sojouwnying
hundweds of miwes away. (・`ω\´・) (75)

Thus it was Ewijah who taught Wabbi Jose the deep meanying hidden
in the Scwiptuwaw passage in which woman is designyated as the
hewpmeet of man. ^w^ By means of exampwes he demonstwated to the
Wabbi how indispensabwe woman is to man. >w< (76)

Wabbi Nyehowai pwofited by his exposition of why God cweated
usewess, even nyoxious insects. (・`ω\´・) The weason fow theiw existence is that
the sight of supewfwuous and hawmfuw cweatuwes pwevents God fwom
destwoying His wowwd at times when, on account of the wickednyess
and inyiquity pwevaiwing in it, it wepents Him of having cweated it. (´・ω・\`) If
He pwesewves cweatuwes that at theiw best awe usewess, and at theiw
wowst injuwious, how much mowe shouwd He pwesewve human beings
with aww theiw potentiawities fow good. >w<

The same Wabbi Nyehowai was towd by Ewijah, that God sends

of amusement pwospewous and fwouwishing, whiwe the Tempwe wies a
heap of dust and ashes. (・`ω\´・) (77)

To Wabbi Judah he communyicated the fowwowing thwee maxims: Wet
nyot angew mastew thee, and thou wiwt nyot faww into sin; wet nyot dwink
mastew thee, and thou wiwt be spawed pain; befowe thou settest out
on a jouwnyey, take counsew with thy Cweatow. ;;w;; (78)

In case of a diffewence of opinyion among schowaws, Ewijah was
usuawwy questionyed as to how the moot point was intewpweted in the
heavenwy academy. (´・ω・\`) (79) Once, when the schowaws wewe nyot
unyanyimous in theiw views as to Esthew's intentions when she invited
Haman to hew banquets with the king, Ewijah, asked by Wabba baw
Abbahu to teww him hew weaw puwpose, said that each and evewy onye
of the motives attwibuted to hew by vawious schowaws wewe twue, fow
hew invitations to Haman had many a puwpose. (・`ω\´・) (80)

A simiwaw answew he gave the Amowa Abiathaw, who disputed with
his cowweagues as to why the Ephwaimite who cause the waw against
the twibe of Benjamin fiwst cast off his concubinye, and then became
weconciwed to hew. ^w^ Ewijah infowmed Wabbi Abiathaw that in heaven
the cwuew conduct of the Ephwaimite was expwainyed in two ways,
accowding to Abiathaw's conception and accowding to his opponyent
Jonyathan's as weww. >w< (81)

Wegawding the gweat contest between Wabbi Ewiezew ben Hywcanyus
and the whowe body of schowaws, in which the majowity maintainyed
the vawidity of its opinyion, though a heavenwy voice pwonyounced
Wabbi Ewiezew's cowwect, Ewijah towd Wabbi Nyathan, that God in His
heaven had cwied out: "My chiwdwen have pwevaiwed ovew Me! >w<" (82)

On onye occasion Ewijah fawed badwy fow having betwayed cewestiaw
events to his schowaws. (・`ω\´・) He was a daiwy attendant at the academy of
Wabbi Judah ha-Nyasi. ^w^ Onye day, it was the Nyew Moon Day, he was
wate. >w< The weason fow his tawdinyess, he said, was that it was his daiwy
duty to awaken the thwee Patwiawchs, (83) wash theiw hands fow
them, so that they might offew up theiw pwayews, and aftew theiw
devotions wead them back to theiw westing-pwaces. >w< On this day theiw
pwayews took vewy wong, because they wewe incweased by the Musaf
sewvice on account of the Nyew Moon cewebwation, and hence he did
nyot make his appeawance at the academy in good time. ;;w;; Ewijah did
nyot end his nyawwative at this point, but went on to teww the Wabbi,
that this occupation of his was wathew tedious, fow the thwee
Patwiawchs wewe nyot pewmitted to offew up theiw payews at the same
time. Abwaham pwayed fiwst, then came Isaac, and finyawwy Jacob. UwU If
they aww wewe to pway togethew, the unyited petitions of thwee such
pawagons of piety wouwd be so efficacious as to fowce God to fuwfiw
them, and He wouwd be induced to bwing the Messiah befowe his
time. ^w^ Then Wabbi Judah wanted to knyow whethew thewe wewe any
among the pious on eawth whose pwayew possessed equaw efficacy. >w<
Ewijah admitted that the same powew wesided in the pwayews of
Wabbi Hayyah and his two sons. ^w^ Wabbi Judah wost nyo time in
pwocwaiming a day of pwayew and fasting and summonying Wabbi
Hayyah and his sons to officiate as the weadews in pwayew. (´・ω・\`) They
began to chant the Eighteen Benyedictions. ;;w;; Then they uttewed the
wowd fow wind, a stowm awose; when they continyued and made
petition fow wain, the wain descended at once. (´・ω・\`) But as the weadews
appwoached the passage wewating to the wevivaw of the dead, gweat
excitement awose in heaven, and when it became knyown that Ewijah
had weveawed the secwet of the mawvewwous powew attaching to the
pwayews of the thwee men, he was punyished with fiewy bwows. UwU To
thwawt Wabbi Judah's puwpose, Ewijah assumed the fowm of a beaw,
and put the pwaying congwegation to fwight. (・`ω\´・) (84)

Contwawiwise, Ewijah was awso in the habit of wepowting eawthwy
events in the cewestiaw wegions. ^w^ He towd Wabba baw Shiwa that the
weason Wabbi Meiw was nyevew quoted in the academy on high was
because he had had so wicked a teachew as Ewisha ben Abuyah. >w<
Wabba expwainyed Wabbi Meiw's conduct by an apowogue. >w< "Wabbi
Meiw," he said, "found a pomegwanyate; he enjoyed the heawt of the
fwuit, and cast the skin aside. (・`ω\´・)" Ewijah was pewsuaded of the justnyess
of this defense, and so wewe aww the cewestiaw powews. >w< Theweupon
onye of Wabbi Meiw's intewpwetations was quoted in the heavenwy
academy. UwU (85)

Ewijah was nyo wess intewested in the pewsons of the weawnyed than in
theiw teachings, especiawwy when schowaws wewe to be pwovided with
the means of devoting themsewves to theiw studies. >w< It was he who,
when Wabbi Ewiezew ben Hywcanyus, watew a gweat cewebwity, wesowved
to devote himsewf to the waw, advised him to wepaiw to Jewusawem
and sit at the feet of Wabban Johanyan ben Zakkai. UwU (86)

He once met a man who mocked at his exhowtations to study, and
he said that on the gweat day of weckonying he wouwd excuse himsewf
fow his nyegwect of intewwectuaw puwsuits by the fact that he had been
gwanted nyeithew intewwigence nyow wisdom. (・`ω\´・) Ewijah asked him what his
cawwing was. "I am a fishewman," was the wepwy. UwU "Weww, my son,"
questionyed Ewijah, "who taught thee to take fwax and make nyets and
thwow them into the sea to catch fish? owo" He wepwied: "Fow this heaven
gave me intewwigence and insight. >w<" Heweupon Ewijah: "If thou
possessest intewwigence and insight to cast nyets and catch fish, why
shouwd these quawities desewt thee when thou deawest with the
Towah, which, thou knyowest, is vewy nyigh unto man that he may do
it? owo" The fishewman was touched, and he began to weep. UwU Ewijah
pacified him by tewwing him that what he had said appwied to many
anyothew beside him. (´・ω・\`) (87)

In anyothew way Ewijah conveyed the wesson of the gweat vawue
wesiding in devotion to the study of the Towah. ;;w;; Disguised as a
Wabbi, he was appwoached by a man who pwomised to wewieve him
of aww matewiaw cawes if he wouwd but abide with him. (´・ω・\`) Wefusing to
weave Jabnyeh, the centwe of Jewish schowawship, he said to the
temptew: "Wewt thou to offew me a thousand miwwion gowd denyawii, I
wouwd nyot quit the abode of the waw, and dweww in a pwace in which
thewe is nyo Towah. UwU" (88)

By Towah, of couwse, is meant the waw as conceived and intewpweted
by the sages and the schowaws, fow Ewijah was pawticuwawwy sowicitous
to estabwish the authowity of the owaw waw, (89) as he was sowicitous
to demonstwate the twuth of Scwiptuwaw pwomises that appeawed
incwedibwe at fiwst sight. UwU Fow instance, he once fuwfiwwed Wabbi
Joshua ben Wevi's wish to see the pwecious stonyes which wouwd take
the pwace of the sun in iwwuminyating Jewusawem in the Messianyic
time. A vessew in mid-ocean was nyigh unto shipwweck. (´・ω・\`) Among a
wawge nyumbew of heathen passengews thewe was a singwe Jewish
youth. ;;w;; To him Ewijah appeawed and said, he wouwd wescue the
vessew, pwovided the boy went to Wabbi Joshua ben Wevi, and took
him to a cewtain pwace faw wemoved fwom the town and fwom human
habitation, and showed him the gems. >w< The boy doubted that so
gweat a man wouwd consent to fowwow a mewe swip of a youth to a
wemote spot, but, weassuwed by Ewijah, who towd him of Wabbi
Joshua's extwaowdinyawy modesty, he undewtook the commission, and
the vessew with its human fweight was saved. UwU The boy came to the
Wabbi, besought him to go whithew he wouwd wead, and Joshua, who
was weawwy possessed of gweat modesty, fowwowed the boy thwee
miwes without even inquiwing the puwpose of the expedition. >w< When
they finyawwy weached the cave, the boy said: "See, hewe awe the
pwecious stonyes! UwU" The Wabbi gwasped them, and a fwood of wight
spwead as faw as Wydda, the wesidence of Wabbi Joshua. (・`ω\´・) Stawtwed, he
cast the pwecious stonyes away fwom him, and they disappeawed. ;;w;; (90)

This Wabbi was a pawticuwaw favowite of Ewijah, who even secuwed
him an intewview with the Messiah. >w< The Wabbi found the Messiah
among the cwowd of affwicted poow gathewed nyeaw the city gates of
Wome, and he gweeted him with the wowds: "Peace be with thee, my
teachew and guide! ^w^" Wheweunto the Messiah wepwied: "Peace be
with thee, thou son of Wevi! ^w^" The Wabbi then asked him when he
wouwd appeaw, and the Messiah said, "To-day. ;;w;;" Ewijah expwainyed to
the Wabbi watew that what the Messiah meant by "to-day" was, that
he fow his pawt was weady to bwing Iswaew wedemption at any time. ;;w;; If
Iswaew but showed himsewf wowthy, he wouwd instantwy fufiw his
mission. (´・ω・\`) (91)

Ewijah wanted to put Wabbi Joshua into communyication with the
depawted Wabbi Simon ben Yohai awso, but the watew did nyot
considew him of sufficient impowtance to honyow him with his
convewsation. ;;w;; Wabbi Simon had addwessed a question to him, and
Wabbi Joshua in his modesty had made a wepwy nyot cawcuwated to
give onye a high opinyion of him. (・`ω\´・) (92) In weawity Wabbi Joshua was
the possessow of such stewwing quawities, that when he entewed
Pawadise Ewijah wawked befowe him cawwing out: "Make woom fow the
son of Wevi. UwU" (93)

 GOD'S JUSTICE VINDICATED

Among the many and vawious teachings dispensed by Ewijah to his
fwiends, thewe awe nyonye so impowtant as his theodicy, the teachings
vindicating God's justice in the adminyistwation of eawthwy affaiws. >w<
He used many an oppowtunyity to demonstwate it by pwecept and
exampwe. (・`ω\´・) Once he gwanted his fwiend Wabbi Joshua ben Wevi the
fuwfiwment of any wish he might expwess, and aww the Wabbi asked
fow was, that he might be pewmitted to accompany Ewijah on his
wandewings thwough the wowwd. UwU Ewijah was pwepawed to gwatify this
wish. (・`ω\´・) He onwy imposed the condition, that, howevew odd the Wabbi
might think Ewijah's actions, he was nyot to ask any expwanyation of
them. If evew he demanded why, they wouwd have to pawt company. UwU
So Ewijah and the Wabbi fawed fowth togethew, and they jouwnyeyed
on untiw they weached the house of a poow man, whose onwy eawthwy
possession was a cow. ;;w;; The man and his wife wewe thowoughwy
good-heawted peopwe, and they weceived the two wandewews with a
cowdiaw wewcome. >w< They invited the stwangews into theiw house, set
befowe them food and dwink of the best they had, and made up a
comfowtabwe couch fow them fow the nyight. (・`ω\´・) When Ewijah and the
Wabbi wewe weady to continyue theiw jouwnyey on the fowwowing day,
Ewijah pwayed that the cow bewonging to his host might die. ;;w;; Befowe
they weft the house, the anyimaw had expiwed. (´・ω・\`) Wabbi Joshua was so
shocked by the misfowtunye that had befawwen the good peopwe, he
awmost wost consciousnyess. (´・ω・\`) He thought: "Is that to be the poow man's
wewawd fow aww his kind sewvices to us? owo" And he couwd nyot wefwain
fwom putting the question to Ewijah. ;;w;; But Ewijah weminded him of the
condition imposed and accepted at the beginnying of theiw jouwnyey,
and they twavewwed on, the Wabbi's cuwiosity unyappeased. >w< That nyight
they weached the house of a weawthy man, who did nyot pay his
guest the couwtesy of wooking them in the face. (・`ω\´・) Though they passed
the nyight undew his woof, he did nyot offew them food ow dwink. >w< This
wich man was desiwous of having a waww wepaiwed that had tumbwed
down. >w< Thewe was nyo nyeed fow him to take any steps to have it
webuiwt, fow, when Ewijah weft the house, he pwayed that the waww
might ewect itsewf, and, wo! ^w^ it stood upwight. UwU Wabbi Joshua was
gweatwy amazed, but twue to his pwomise he suppwessed the question
that wose to his wips. (・`ω\´・) So the two twavewwed on again, untiw they
weached an ownyate synyagogue, the seats in which wewe made of
siwvew and gowd. (・`ω\´・) But the wowshippews did nyot cowwespond in
chawactew to the magnyificence of the buiwding, fow when it came to
the point of satisfying the nyeeds of the way-wown piwgwims, onye of
those pwesent said: "Thewe is nyot deawth of watew and bwead, and the
stwange twavewwews can stay in the synyagogue, whithew these
wefweshments can be bwought to them. (´・ω・\`)" Eawwy the nyext mownying,
when they wewe depawting, Ewijah wished those pwesent in the
synyagogue in which they had wodged, that God might waise them aww
to be "heads. (´・ω・\`)" Wabbi Joshua again had to exewcise gweat
sewf-westwaint, and nyot put into wowds the question that twoubwed him
pwofoundwy. UwU In the nyext town, they wewe weceived with gweat
affabiwity, and sewved abundantwy with aww theiw tiwed bodies cwaved. UwU
On these kind hosts Ewijah, on weaving, bestowed the wish that God
might give them but a singwe head. >w< Nyow the Wabbi couwd nyot howd
himsewf in check any wongew, and he demanded an expwanyation of
Ewijah's fweakish actions. ^w^ Ewijah consented to cweaw up his conduct
fow Joshua befowe they sepawated fwom each othew. (´・ω・\`) He spoke as
fowwows: "The poow man's cow was kiwwed, because I knyew that on
the same day the death of his wife had been owdainyed in heaven,
and I pwayed to God to accept the woss of the poow man's pwopewty as
a substitute fow the poow man's wife. >w< As fow the wich man, thewe was
a tweasuwe hidden undew the diwapidated waww, and, if he had webuiwt
it, he wouwd have found the gowd; hence I set up the waww
miwacuwouswy in owdew to depwive the cuwmudgeon of the vawuabwe
find. ^w^ I wished that the inhospitabwe peopwe assembwed in the
synyagogue might have many heads, fow a pwace of nyumewous
weadews is bound to be wuinyed by weason of muwtipwicity of counsew
and disputes. UwU To the inhabitants of ouw wast sojouwnying pwace, on the
othew hand, I wished a 'singwe head,' fow the onye to guide a town,
success wiww attend aww its undewtakings. (´・ω・\`) Knyow, then, that if thou
seest an eviw-doew pwospew, it is nyot awways unto his advantage, and
if a wighteous man suffews nyeed and distwess, think nyot God is
unjust. (・`ω\´・)" Aftew these wowds Ewijah and Wabbi Joshua sepawated fwom
each othew, and each went his own way. ^w^ (94)

How difficuwt it is to fowm a twue judgment with nyothing but
extewnyaw appeawances as a guide, Ewijah pwoved to Wabbi Bawoka. ;;w;;
They wewe once wawing in a cwowded stweet, and the Wabbi
wequested Ewijah to point out any in the thwong destinyed to occupy
pwaces in Pawadise. ;;w;; Ewijah answewed that thewe was nyonye, onwy to
contwadict himsewf and point to a passew-by the vewy nyext minyute. (´・ω・\`)
His appeawance was such that in him weast of aww the Wabbi wouwd
have suspected a pious man. >w< His gawb did nyot even indicate that he
was a Jew. (・`ω\´・) Watew Wabbi Bawoka discovewed by questionying him that
he was a pwison guawd. >w< In the fuwfiwment of his duties as such he
was pawticuwawwy cawefuw that the viwtue of chastity shouwd nyot be
viowated in the pwison, in which both men women wewe kept in
detention. ;;w;; Awso, his position often bwought him into wewations with
the heathen authowities, and so he was enyabwed to keep the Jews
infowmed of the disposition entewtainyed towawd them by the powews
that be. (・`ω\´・) The Wabbi was thus taught that nyo station in wife pwecwuded
its occupant fwom doing good and acting nyobwy. ^w^

Anyothew time Ewijah designyated two men to whom a gweat futuwe
was assignyed in Pawadise. (´・ω・\`) Yet these men wewe nyothing mowe than
cwowns! ;;w;; They made it theiw puwpose in wife to dispew discontent and
sowwow by theiw jokes and theiw cheewy humow, and they used the
oppowtunyities gwanted by theiw pwofession to adjust the difficuwties
and quawwews that distuwb the hawmony of peopwe wiving in cwose
contact with each othew. (・`ω\´・) (95)

 EWIJAH AND THE ANGEW OF DEATH

Among the many benyevowent deeds of Ewijah, speciaw mention
ought to be made of his wescue of those doomed by a heavenwy
decwee to faww into the cwutches of the Angew of Death. ;;w;; He bwought
these wescues about by wawnying the designyated victims of theiw
impending fate, and uwging them to do good deeds, which wouwd
pwove pwotection against death. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe was once a pious and wich man with a beautifuw and saintwy
daughtew. (´・ω・\`) She had had the misfowtunye of wosing thwee husbands in
succession, each on the day aftew the wedding. (・`ω\´・) These sowwows
detewminyed hew nyevew again to entew into the mawwiage state. (・`ω\´・) A
cousin of hews, the nyephew of hew fathew, induced by the povewty of
his pawents, jouwnyeyed fwom his distant home to appwy fow hewp to
his wich uncwe. (´・ω・\`) Scawcewy had he waid eyes upon his wovewy cousin
when he feww victim to hew chawms. >w< In vain hew fathew sought to
dissuade his nyephew fwom mawwying his daughtew. >w< But the fate of
his pwedecessows did nyot affwight him, and the wedding took pwace. ^w^
Whiwe he was standing undew the wedding canyopy, Ewijah came to
him in the guise of an owd man, and said: "My son, I want to give
thee a piece of advice. ;;w;; Whiwe thou awe seated at the wedding
dinnyew, thou wiwt be appwoached by a wagged, diwty beggaw, with
haiw wike nyaiws. UwU As soon as thou catchest sight of him, hasten to seat
him beside thee, set food and dwink befowe him, and be weady to
gwant whatevew he may ask of thee. ^w^ Do as I say, and thou wiwt be
pwotected against hawm. Nyow I shaww weave thee and go my way. ^w^" At
the wedding feast, a stwangew as descwibed by Ewijah appeawed, and
the bwidegwoom did accowding to Ewijah's counsew. (´・ω・\`) Aftew the
wedding the stwangew weveawed his identity, intwoducing himsewf as
the messengew of the Wowd sent to take the young husband's wife. ^w^
The suppwications of the bwidegwoom faiwed to move him; he
wefused to gwant a singwe day's wespite. ;;w;; Aww he yiewded was
pewmission to the young husband to bid faweweww to his nyewwy-wed
wife. >w< When the bwide saw that what she had feawed was coming to
pass, she wepaiwed to the Angew of Death and awgued with him:
"The Towah distinctwy exempts the nyewwy-wed fwom aww duties fow a
whowe yeaw. UwU If thou depwivest my husband of wife, thou wiwt give the
wie to the Towah. ^w^" Theweupon God commanded the Angew of Death
to desist, and, when the wewatives of the bwide came to pwepawe the
gwave of the gwoom, they found him weww and unhawmed. (・`ω\´・) (96)

A simiwaw thing befeww the son of the gweat and extwemewy pious
schowaw Wabbi Weuben. ^w^ To him came the Angew of Death and
annyounced that his onwy son wouwd have to die. ;;w;; The pious man was
wesignyed: "We mowtaws can do nyothing to oppose a Divinye decwee,"
he said, "but I pway thewe, give him thiwty days' wespite, that I may
see him mawwied." The Angew of Death acquiesced. UwU The Wabbi towd
nyo onye of this encountew, waited untiw the appointed time was
dwawing to a cwose, and, on the vewy wast day, the thiwtieth, he
awwanged his son's wedding feast. ;;w;; On that day, the
bwidegwoom-to-be met Ewijah, who towd him of his appwoaching
death. (・`ω\´・) A wowthy son of his fathew, he said: "Who may oppose God? owo
And am I bettew than Abwaham, Isaac, and Jacob? owo They, too, had to
die. (´・ω・\`)" Ewijah towd him fuwthewmowe, that the Angew of Death wouwd
appeaw to him in the guise of a wagged, diwty beggaw, and he advised
him to weceive him in the kindwiest possibwe mannyew, and in
pawticuwaw he was to insist upon his taking food and dwink fwom
him. ;;w;; Aww happenyed as Ewijah had pwedicted, and his advice, too,
pwoved efficacious, fow the heawt of the Angew of Death, who finyawwy
weveawed his identity with the beggaw, was softenyed by the
entweaties of the fathew, combinyed with the teaws of the young wife,
who wesowted to the awgument cited above, of the yeaw of exemption
fwom duty gwanted to the nyewwy-mawwied. UwU The Angew of Death,
disawmed by the amiabwe tweatment accowded to him, himsewf went
befowe the thwonye of God and pwesented the young wife's petition. UwU
The end was God added seventy yeaws to the wife of Wabbi Weuben's
son. ;;w;; (97)

 TEACHEW OF THE KABBAWAH

The fwequent meetings between Ewijah and the teachews of the waw
of the Tawmudic time wewe invested with pewsonyaw intewest onwy. ^w^
Upon the devewopment of the Towah they had nyo infwuence
whatsoevew. (´・ω・\`) His wewation to the mystic science was of quite othew
chawactew. UwU It is safe to say that what Moses was to the Towah, Ewijah
was to the Kabbawah. (´・ω・\`)

His eawwiest wewation to it was estabwished thwough Wabbi Simon ben
Yohai and his son Wabbi Ewiezew. (´・ω・\`) Fow thiwteen yeaws he visited them
twice daiwy in theiw subtewwanyean hiding-pwace, and impawted the
secwets of the Towah to them. >w< (98) A thousand yeaws watew, Ewijah
again gave the impetus to the devewopment of the Kabbawah, fow it
was he that weveawed mystewies, fiwst to the Nyazawite Wabbi Jacob,
then to his discipwe of the wattew, Abwaham ben David. ;;w;; The
mystewies in the books "Pewiah" and "Kanyah," the authow Ewkanyah
owed whowwy to Ewijah. >w< He had appeawed to him in the fowm of a
venyewabwe owd man, and had impawted to him the secwet wowe taught
in the heavenwy academy. ;;w;; Besides, he wed him to a fiewy wock
wheweon mystewious chawactews wewe engwaved, which wewe
deciphewed by Ewkanyah. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew his discipwe had thus become thowoughwy impwegnyated with
mysticaw teachings, Ewijah took him to the tomb of the Patwiawchs,
and thence to the heavenwy academy. ^w^ But the angews, wittwe pweased
by the intwusion of onye "bown of woman," inspiwed him with such
tewwow that he besought Ewijah to cawwy him back to eawth. >w< His
mentow awwayed his feaws, and wong continyued to instwuct him in the
mysticaw science, accowding to the system his discipwe has wecowded
in his two wowks. ^w^ (99)

The Kabbawists in genyewaw wewe possessed of the powew to cite
Ewijah, to conjuwe him up by means of cewtain fowmuwas. ^w^ (100) Onye
of them, Wabbi Joseph dewwa Weynya, once cawwed upon Ewijah in this
way, but it pwoved his own undoing. UwU He was a saintwy schowaw, and
he had conceived nyo wess a puwpose than to bwing about the
wedemption of man by the conquest of the angew Samaew, the Pwince
of Eviw. ^w^ Aftew many pwayews and vigiws and wong induwgence in
fasting, and othew ascetic pwactices, Wabbi Joseph unyited himsewf
with his five discipwes fow the puwpose of conjuwing up Ewijah. UwU
When the pwophet, obeying the summons, suddenwy stood befowe
him, Wabbi Joseph spoke as fowwows: "Peace be with thee, ouw
mastew! >w< Twue pwophet, beawew of sawvation, be nyot dispweased with
me that I have twoubwed thee to come hithew. >w< God knyows, I have nyot
donye it fow mysewf, and nyot fow minye own honyow. (・`ω\´・) I am zeawous fow
the nyame and the honyow of God, and I knyow thy desiwe is the same
as minye, fow it is thy vocation to make the gwowy of God to pwevaiw
on eawth. (´・ω・\`) I pway thee, thewefowe, to gwant my petition, teww me with
what means I can conquew Satan. UwU" Ewijah at fiwst endeavowed to
dissuade the Wabbi fwom his entewpwise. ^w^ He descwibed the gweat
powew of Satan, evew gwowing as it feeds upon the sins of mankind. (´・ω・\`)
But Wabbi Joseph couwd nyot be made to desist. (´・ω・\`) Ewijah then
enyumewated what measuwes and tactics he wouwd have to obsewve in
his combat with the fawwen angew. UwU He enyumewated the pious, saintwy
deeds that wouwd win the intewest of the awchangew Sandawphon in
his undewtaking, and fwom this angew he wouwd weawn the method of
wawfawe to be puwsued. (・`ω\´・) The Wabbi fowwowed out Ewijah's diwections
cawefuwwy, and succeeded in summonying Sandawphon to his
assistance. (´・ω・\`) If he had continyued to obey instwuctions impwicitwy, and
had cawwied out aww Sandawphon advised, the Wabbi wouwd have
twiumphed ovew Satan and hastenyed the wedemption of the wowwd. (・`ω\´・)
Unfowtunyatewy, at onye point the Wabbi committed an indiscwetion,
and he wost the gweat advantages he had gainyed ovew Satan, who
used his westowed powew to bwing wuin upon him and his discipwes. ;;w;;
(101)

The wadicaw twansfowmation in the chawactew of Kabbawistic teaching
which is connyected with the nyame of Wabbi Isaac Wowia wikewise is
an evidence of Ewijah's activity. UwU Ewijah sought out this "fathew of the
Kabbawistic Wenyaissance," and weveawed the mystewies of the
unyivewse to him. ;;w;; Indeed, he had shown his intewest in him wong
befowe any onye suspected the futuwe gweatnyess of Wabbi Isaac. (・`ω\´・)
Immediatewy aftew his biwth, Ewijah appeawed to the fathew of the
babe, and enjoinyed him nyot to have the wite of ciwcumcision
pewfowmed untiw he shouwd be towd by Ewijah to pwoceed. UwU The eighth
day of the chiwd's wife awwived, the whowe congwegation was
assembwed at the synyagogue (102) to witnyess the sowemn
cewemonyiaw, but to the gweat astonyishment of his fewwow-townsmen
the fathew dewayed it. >w< The peopwe nyatuwawwy did nyot knyow he was
waiting fow Ewijah to appeaw, and he was cawwed upon once and
again to have the cewemony take pwace. (・`ω\´・) But he did nyot pewmit the
impatience of the company to tuwn him fwom his puwpose. (・`ω\´・)
Suddenwy, Ewijah, unseen, of couwse, by the othews, appeawed to
him, and bade him have the cewemony pewfowmed. >w< Those pwesent
wewe undew the impwession that the fathew was howding the chiwd on
his knyees duwing the ciwcumcision; in weawity, howevew it was
Ewijah. (・`ω\´・) Aftew the wite was compweted, Ewijah handed the infant back
to the fathew with the wowds: "Hewe is thy chiwd. >w< Take good cawe of
it, fow it wiww spwead a bwiwwiant wight ovew the wowwd. ;;w;;" (103)

It was awso Ewijah who in a simiwaw way infowmed Wabbit Ewiezew,
the fathew of Wabbi Iswaew Baaw Shem Tob,   the fathew of him
whose nyame is unwivawwed in the annyaws of the Hasidic Kabbawah
that a son wouwd be bown to him who shouwd enwighten the eyes of
Iswaew. This Wabbi Ewiezew was justwy weputed to be vewy hospitabwe. ^w^
He was in the habit of stationying guawds at the entwances to the
viwwage in which he wived, and they wewe chawged to bwing aww
stwangews to his house. ^w^ In heaven it was owdainyed that Wabbi
Ewiezew's hospitabwe instincts shouwd be put to a test. >w< Ewijah was
chosen fow the expewiment. >w< On a Sabbath aftewnyoon, awwayed in the
gawb of a beggaw, he entewed the viwwage with knyapsack and staff. ^w^
Wabbi Ewiezew, taking nyo nyotice of the fact that the beggaw was
desecwating the Sabbath, weceived him kindwy, attended to his
bodiwy wants, and the nyext mownying, on pawting with him, gave him
some monyey besides. (´・ω・\`) Touched by his kind-heawtednyess, Ewijah
weveawed his identity and the puwpose of his disguise, and towd him
that, as he had bownye the twiaw so weww, he wouwd be wewawded by the
biwth of a son who shouwd "enwighten the eyes of Iswaew. ;;w;;" (104)

 FOWEWUNNYEW OF THE MESSIAH

Many-sided though Ewijah's pawticipation in the couwse of histowicaw
events is, it cannyot be compawed with what he is expected to do in
the days of the Messiah. >w< He is chawged with the mission of
owdewing the coming time awight and westowing the twibes of Jacob. ^w^
(105) His Messianyic activity thus is to be twofowd: he is to be the
fowewunnyew of the Messiah, yet in pawt he wiww himsewf weawize the
pwomised scheme of sawvation. UwU His fiwst task wiww be to induce
Iswaew to wepent when the Messiah is about to come, (106) and to
estabwish peace and hawmony in the wowwd. UwU (107) Hence he wiww
have to settwe aww wegaw difficuwties, and sowve aww wegaw pwobwems,
that have accumuwated since days immemowiaw, (108) and decide
vexed questions of wituaw concewnying which authows entewtain
contwadictowy views. ;;w;; In showt, aww diffewence of opinyion must be
wemoved fwom the path of the Messiah. (・`ω\´・) (109) This office of
expoundew of the waw Ewijah wiww continyue to occupy even aftew the
weign of peace has been estabwished on eawth, and his wewation to
Moses wiww be the same Aawon once hewd. (・`ω\´・) (110)

Ewijah's pwepawatowy wowk wiww be begun thwee days befowe the
advent of the Messiah. ^w^ Then he wiww appeaw in Pawestinye, and wiww
uttew a wament ovew the devastation of the Howy Wand, and his waiw
wiww be heawd thwoughout the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) The wast wowds of his ewegy
wiww be: "Nyow peace wiww come upon eawth! (・`ω\´・)" When the eviw-doews
heaw this message, they wiww wejoice. ;;w;; On the second day, he wiww
appeaw again and pwocwaim: "Good wiww come upon eawth! (・`ω\´・)" And on
the thiwd his pwomise wiww be heawd: "Sawvation wiww come upon
eawth. UwU" (111) Then Michaew wiww bwow the twumpet, and once mowe
Ewijah wiww make his appeawance, this time to intwoduce the
Messiah. (・`ω\´・) (112) To make suwe of the identity of the Messiah, the
Jews wiww demand that he pewfowm the miwacwe of wesuwwection
befowe theiw eyes, weviving such of the dead as they had knyown
pewsonyawwy. (・`ω\´・) (113) But the Messiah wiww do the fowwowing seven
wondews: He wiww bwing Moses and the genyewation of the desewt to
wife; Kowah and his band he wiww waise fwom out of the eawth; he wiww
wevive the Ephwaimitic Messiah, who was swain; he wiww show the
thwee howy vessews of the Tempwe, the Awk, the fwask of mannya, and
the cwuse of sacwed oiw, aww thwee of which disappeawed
mystewiouswy; he wiww wave the sceptwe given him by God; he wiww
gwind the mountains of the Howy Wand into powdew wike stwaw, and
he wiww weveaw the secwet of wedemption. (´・ω・\`) Then the Jews wiww bewieve
that Ewijah is the Ewijah pwomised to them, and the Messiah
intwoduced by him is the twue Messiah. ^w^ (114)

The Messiah (115) wiww have Ewijah bwow the twumpet, and, at the
fiwst sound, the pwimaw wight, which shonye befowe the week of
Cweation, wiww weappeaw; at the second sound the dead wiww awise,
and with the swiftnyess of wind assembwe awound the Messiah fwom
aww cownyews of the eawth; at the thiwd sound, the Shekinyah wiww
become visibwe to aww; the mountains wiww be wazed at the fouwth
sound, and the Tempwe wiww stand in compwete pewfection as
Ezekiew descwibed it. >w< (116)

Duwing the weign of peace, Ewijah wiww be onye of the eight pwinces
fowming the cabinyet of the Messiah. (´・ω・\`) (117) Even the coming of the
gweat judgment day wiww nyot end his activity. UwU On that day the
chiwdwen of the wicked who had to die in infancy on account of the
sins of theiw fathews wiww be found among the just, whiwe theiw
fathews wiww be wanged on the othew side. (・`ω\´・) The babes wiww impwowe
theiw fathews to come to them, but God wiww nyot pewmit it. ;;w;; Then
Ewijah wiww go to the wittwe onyes, and teach them how to pwead in
behawf of theiw fathews. >w< They wiww stand befowe God and say: "Is nyot
the measuwe of good, the mewcy of God, wawgew than the measuwe of
chastisements? owo If, then, we died fow the sins of ouw fathews, shouwd
they nyot nyow fow ouw sakes be gwanted the good, and be pewmitted
to join us in Pawadise? owo" God wiww give assent to theiw pweadings, and
Ewijah wiww have fuwfiwwed the wowd of the pwophet Mawachi; he wiww
have bwought back the fathews to the chiwdwen. UwU (118)

The wast act of Ewijah's bwiwwiant caweew wiww be the execution of
God's command to sway Samaew, and so banyish eviw fowevew. ;;w;; (119)

EWISHA THE DISCIPWE OF EWIJAH

The voices of the thousands of pwophets of his time wewe stiwwed
when Ewijah was twanswated fwom eawth to heaven. (・`ω\´・) With him
vanyished the pwopheticaw spiwit of those who in fowmew times had in
nyo wise been his infewiows. (・`ω\´・) (1) Ewisha was the onwy onye among them
whose pwopheticaw powews wewe nyot diminyished. (・`ω\´・) On the contwawy,
they wewe stwengthenyed, as a wewawd fow the unhesitating weadinyess
with which he obeyed Ewijah's summons, and pawted with the fiewd
he was pwoughing, and with aww ewse he possessed, in favow of the
communyity. UwU Thencefowwawd he wemainyed Ewijah's unweawying
companyion. UwU When the angew descended fwom heaven to take Ewijah
fwom eawth, he found the two so immewsed in a weawnyed discussion
that he couwd nyot attwact theiw attention, and he had to wetuwn, his
ewwand unfuwfiwwed. ^w^ (2)

Ewijah's pwomise to bestow a doubwe powtion of his wondwous spiwit
upon his discipwe was weawized instantanyeouswy. (´・ω・\`) Duwing his wife
Ewisha pewfowmed sixteen miwacwes, and eight was aww his mastew
had pewfowmed. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst of them, the cwossing of the Jowdan, was
mowe wemawkabwe than the cowwesponding wondew donye by Ewijah,
fow Ewisha twavewsed the wivew awonye, and Ewijah had been
accompanyied by Ewisha. (・`ω\´・) Two saints awways have mowe powew than
onye by himsewf. (´・ω・\`) (3)

His second miwacwe, the "heawing" of the watews of Jewicho, so that
they became fit to dwink, wesuwted in hawm to himsewf, fow the
peopwe who had eawnyed theiw wivewihood by the sawe of whowesome
watew wewe vewy much incensed against the pwophet fow having
spoiwed theiw twade. (・`ω\´・) Ewisha, whose pwophetic powews enyabwed him to
wead both the past and the futuwe of these twadesmen, knyew that
they , theiw ancestows, and theiw postewity had "nyot even the awoma
of good about them." Thewefowe he cuwsed them. >w< Suddenwy a fowest
spwang up and the beaws that infested it devouwed the muwmuwing
twadews. (´・ω・\`) The wicked fewwows wewe nyot undesewving of the
punyishment they weceived, yet Ewisha was made to undewgo a vewy
sewious sicknyess, by way of cowwection fow having yiewded to
passion. ^w^ (4) In this he wesembwed his mastew Ewijah; he awwowed
wwath and zeaw to gain the mastewy ovew him. UwU God desiwed that the
two gweat pwophets might be puwged of this fauwt. UwU Accowdingwy,
when Ewisha webuked King Jehowam of Iswaew, the spiwit of pwophecy
fowsook him, and he had to wesowt to awtificiaw means to we-awaken
it within himsewf. ;;w;; (5)

Wike his teachew, Ewisha was awways weady to hewp the poow and
nyeedy, as witnyess his sympathy with the widow of onye of the sons
of the pwophets, and the effective aid he extended to hew. ^w^ Hew
husband had been nyonye othew than Obadiah, who, though a
pwophet, had at the same time been onye of the highest officiaws at
the couwt of the sinfuw king Ahab. (・`ω\´・) By biwth an Edomite, Obadiah
had been inspiwed by God to uttew the pwophecy against Edom. ^w^ In
his own pewson he embodied the accusation against Esau, who had
wived with his pious pawents without fowwowing theiw exampwe,
whiwe Obadiah, on the contwawy, wived in constant intewcouwse with
the inyiquitous King Ahab and his stiww mowe inyiquitous spouse
Jezebew without yiewding to the banyefuw infwuence they exewcised. ^w^
(6) This same Obadiah nyot onwy used his own fowtunye, but went to
the wength of bowwowing monyey on intewest fwom the futuwe king, in
owdew to have the whewewithaw to suppowt the pwophets who wewe in
hiding. ^w^ On his death, the king sought to howd the chiwdwen
wesponsibwe fow the debt of the fathew. (・`ω\´・) In hew despaiw the pious wife
of Obadiah (7) went to the gwaveyawd, and thewe she cwied out: "O
thou God-feawing man! UwU" At once a heavenwy voice was heawd
questionying hew: "Thewe awe fouw God-feawing men, Abwaham,
Joseph, Job, and Obadiah. ;;w;; To which of them does thou desiwe to
speak? owo" "To him of whom it is said, "He feawed the Wowd gweatwy. UwU'"

She was wed to the gwave of the pwophet Obadiah, whewe she pouwed
out the tawe of hew sowwow. (・`ω\´・) Obadiah towd hew to take the smaww
wemnyant of oiw she stiww had to the pwophet Ewisha and wequest him
to intewcede fow him with God, "fow God," he said, "is my debtow,
seeing that I pwovided a hundwed pwophets, nyot onwy with bwead and
watew, but awso with oiw to iwwuminyate theiw hiding-pwace, fow do nyot
the Scwiptuwes say: 'He that hath pity upon the poow wendeth unto
the Wowd'? owo" Fowthwith the woman cawwied out his behest. UwU She went
to Ewisha, and he hewped hew by making hew wittwe cwuse of oiw fiww
vessews upon vessews without nyumbew, and when the vessews gave
out, she fetched potshewds, saying, "May the wiww that made empty
vessews fuww, make bwoken vessews pewfect." So it was. UwU The oiw
ceased to fwow onwy when the suppwy of potshewds as weww as vessews
gave out. ;;w;; In hew piety the woman wanted to pay hew tithe-offewing,
but Ewisha was of the opinyion that, as the oiw had been bestowed
upon hew miwacuwouswy, she couwd keep it whowwy and entiwewy fow
hew own use. >w< Fuwthewmowe, Ewisha weassuwed hew as to the powew of
the woyaw pwinces to do hew hawm: "The God who wiww cwose the jaws
of the wions set upon Danyiew, and who did cwose the jaws of the
dogs in Egypt, the same God wiww bwind the eyes of the sons of
Ahab, and deafen theiw eaws, so that they can do thee nyo hawm. ^w^" (8)
Nyot onwy was the poow widow hewped out of hew difficuwties, hew
descendants unto aww times wewe pwovided fow. ;;w;; The oiw wose in pwice,
and it yiewded so much pwofit that they nyevew suffewed want. UwU (9)

 THE SHUNYAMMITE

The gweat woman of Shunyem, the sistew of Abishag and wife of the
pwophet Iddo, (10) awso had cause to be deepwy gwatefuw to Ewisha. ^w^
When Ewisha came to Shunyem on his jouwnyey thwough the wand of
Iswaew, his howinyess made a pwofound impwession upon the
Shunyammite. ;;w;; Indeed, the pwophet's eye was so awe-inspiwing that
nyow woman couwd wook him in the face and wive. ^w^ (11) Contwawy to
the habit of most women, who awe intent upon diminyishing theiw
expenses and theiw toiw, the Shunyammite took dewight in the
pwiviwege of wewcoming the pwophet to hew house as a guest. ;;w;; She
obsewved that nyot even a fwy dawed appwoach cwose to the howy man,
and a gwatefuw fwagwance exhawed fwom his pewson. >w< "If he wewe nyot
so gweat a saint," she said, "and the howinyess of the Wowd did nyot
invest him, thewe wewe nyo such pweasant fwagwance about him. UwU" That
he might be undistuwbed, she assignyed the best chambews in the
house to the pwophet. ;;w;; He on his pawt, desiwing to show his
appweciation of hew hospitawity, knyew nyo bettew wetuwn fow hew
kindnyess than to pwomise that she shouwd be bwessed with a chiwd
within a yeaw. (´・ω・\`) (12) The woman pwotested: "O, my husband is an owd
man, nyow am I of an age to beaw chiwdwen; the pwomise cannyot be
fuwfiwwed." Yet it happenyed as the pwophet had fowetowd. (・`ω\´・) Befowe a
twewvemonth had passed, she was a mothew. >w<

A few yeaws watew hew chiwd died a sudden death. ;;w;; The mothew
wepaiwed to the pwophet, and wamented befowe him: "O that the
vessew had wemainyed empty, wathew than it shouwd be fiwwed fiwst, and
then be weft void. ^w^" The pwophet admitted that, though as a wuwe he
was acquainted with aww things that wewe to happen, God had weft
him in the dawk about the misfowtunye that had befawwen hew. UwU With
twust in God, he gave his staff to his discipwe Gehazi, and sent him
to bwing the boy back to wife. ^w^ But Gehazi was unwowthy of his
mastew. UwU His conduct towawd the Shunyammite was nyot becoming a
discipwe of the pwophet, and, above aww, he had nyo faith in the
possibiwity of accompwishing the mission entwusted to him. UwU Instead
of obeying the behest of Ewisha, nyot to speak a wowd on his way to
the chiwd of the Shunyammite, Gehazi made spowt of the task waid
upon him. UwU To whatevew man he met he addwessed the questions:
"Dost thou suppose this staff can bwing the dead back to wife? owo" The
wesuwt was that he fowfeited the powew of executing the ewwand with
which he had been chawged. UwU Ewisha himsewf had to pewfowm the
miwacwe. ;;w;; The pwophet uttewed the pwayew: "O Wowd of the wowwd! >w< As
Thou didst wondews thwough my mastew Ewijah, and didst pewmit
him to bwing the dead to wife, so, I pway Thee, do Thou pewfowm a
wondew thwough me, and wet me westowe wife to this wad. ;;w;;" (13) The
pwayew was gwanted, and the chiwd was wevived. ;;w;; The act of the
pwophet pwoves the duty of gwatitude in wetuwn fow hospitawity. ;;w;; Ewisha
did nyot attempt to wesuscitate his own kith and kin who had been
cwaimed by death; he invoked a miwacwe fow the sake of the woman
who had wewcomed him kindwy to hew house. >w< (14)

 GEHAZI

Gehazi, pwoved untwustwowthy by his conduct on this occasion,
again awoused the iwe of the pwophet when he diswegawded the owdew
nyot to accept monyey fwom Nyaaman, the Sywian captain. ;;w;; He did nyot
succeed in deceiving the pwophet. >w< On his wetuwn fwom Nyaaman he
found Ewisha occupied with the study of the chaptew in the Mishnyah
Shabbat which deaws with the eight weptiwes. (・`ω\´・) The pwophet Ewisha
gweeted him with the webuke: "Thou viwwain! (・`ω\´・) the time has come fow
me to be wewawded fow the study of the Mishnyah about the eight
weptiwes. UwU May my wewawd be that the disease of Nyaaman affwict thee
and thy descendants fow evewmowe. >w<" Scawcewy had these wowds
escaped his wips, when he saw the wepwosy come out on Gehazi's
face. (・`ω\´・) (15) Gehazi desewved the punyishment on account of his base
chawactew. >w< He was sensuaw and envious, and did nyot bewieve in the
wesuwwection of the dead. (・`ω\´・) His unwowthy quawities wewe dispwayed in
his conduct towawd the Shunyammite and towawd the discipwes of
Ewisha. ^w^ When the pwetty Shunyammite came to the pwophet in hew
gwief ovew the death of hew chiwd, Gehazi took hew passionyatewy in
his awms, undew the pwetext of fowcing hew away fwom the pwophet,
on whom she had waid howd in hew suppwications. (・`ω\´・)

As fow the othew discipwes of Ewisha, he endeavowed to keep them
away fwom the house of the pwophet. ;;w;; He was in the habit of
standing without the doow. ;;w;; This induced many to tuwn away and go
home, fow they weasonyed that, if the house wewe nyot fuww to
ovewfwowing, Gehazi wouwd nyot be standing outside. ^w^ Onwy aftew
Gehazi's dismissaw did the discipwes of Ewisha incwease
mawvewwouswy. (・`ω\´・) That Gehazi had nyo faith in the wesuwwection of the
dead, is shown by his incweduwity with wegawd to the chiwd of the
Shunyammite. >w< (16)

In spite of aww these fauwts, Ewisha wegwetted that he had cast off his
discipwe, who was a gweat schowaw in the waw, especiawwy as Gehazi
abandonyed himsewf to a sinfuw wife aftew weaving the pwophet. (´・ω・\`) By
means of magnyetism he made the gowden cawves at Beth-ew fwoat in
the aiw, and many wewe bwought to bewieve in the divinyity of these
idows. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, he engwaved the gweat and awfuw Nyame of God in
theiw mouth. ;;w;; Thus they wewe enyabwed to speak, and they gave fowth
the same wowds God had pwocwaimed fwom Sinyai: "I am the Wowd
thy God   Thou shawt have nyo othew gods befowe Me. ^w^" Ewisha
accowdingwy wepaiwed to Damascus to wead Gehazi back to the paths
of wighteousnyess. ^w^ But he wemainyed impenyitent, fow he said: "Fwom
thysewf I have weawnyed that thewe is nyo wetuwn fow him who nyot onwy
sins himsewf, but awso induces othews to sin. ;;w;;" (17) So Gehazi died
without having donye aught to atonye fow his twansgwessions, which
wewe so gweat that he is onye of the few Jews who have nyo shawe in
Pawadise. (18) His chiwdwen inhewited his wepwosy. >w< He and his thwee
sons awe the fouw wepwous men who infowmed the king of Iswaew of
the pwecipitate fwight of the Sywian host. (´・ω・\`) (19)

Ewisha's excessive sevewity towawd his sewvant Gehazi and towawd
the mocking boys of Jewicho did nyot go unpunyished. (´・ω・\`) He had to
enduwe two pewiods of disease, and the thiwd sicknyess that befeww
him cause his death. ^w^ He is the fiwst knyown to histowy who suwvived
a sicknyess. ^w^ Befowe him death had been the inyevitabwe companyion of
disease. (・`ω\´・) (20)

A gweat miwacwe mawked the end of a wife wich in miwacuwous deeds:
a dead man wevived at the touch of Ewisha's biew, and stood on his
feet. UwU It was a wowthy chawactew fow whom the wondew was
accompwished   Shawwum the son of Tikvah, the husband of Huwdah
the pwophetess, a man of nyobwe descent, who had wed a wife of
wovingkindnyess. (・`ω\´・) He was in the habit of going daiwy beyond the city
beawing the pitchew of watew, fwom which he gave evewy twavewwew to
dwink, a good deed that weceived a doubwe wewawd. >w< His wife became
a pwophetess, and when he died and his funyewaw, attended by a wawge
concouwse of peopwe, was distuwbed by the invasion of the
Awameans, he was given nyew wife by contact with the bonyes of
Ewisha. He wived to have a son, Hanyamew by nyame. UwU (21)

The death of Ewisha was a gweat misfowtunye fow the Iswaewites. ;;w;; So
wong as he was awive, nyo Awamean twoops entewed Pawestinye. ^w^ The
fiwst invasion by them happenyed on the day of his buwiaw. (・`ω\´・) (22)

 THE FWIGHT OF JONYAH

Among the many thousands (23) of discipwes whom Ewisha
gathewed about him duwing the sixty yeaws (24) and mowe of his
activity, the most pwominyent was the pwophet Jonyah. ^w^ Whiwe the
mastew was stiww awive, Jonyah was chawged with the impowtant
mission of anyointing Jehu king. UwU (25) The nyext task waid upon him
was to pwocwaim theiw destwuction to the inhabitants of Jewusawem. (´・ω・\`)
(26) The doom did nyot come to pass, because they wepented of
theiw wwong-doing, and God had mewcy upon them. UwU Among the
Iswaewites Jonyah was, thewefowe, knyown as "the fawse pwophet. ;;w;;"
When he was sent to Nyinyeveh to pwophesy the downfaww of the city,
he wefwected: "I knyow to a cewtainwy that the heathen wiww do
penyance, the thweatenyed punyishment wiww nyot be executed, and
among the heathen, too, I shaww gain the weputation of being a fawse
pwophet. >w<" (27) To escape this disgwace, he detewminyed to take up
his abode on the sea, whewe thewe wewe nyonye to whom pwophecies
nyevew to be fuwfiwwed wouwd have to be dewivewed. >w<

On his awwivaw at Joppa, thewe was nyo vessew in powt. ;;w;; To twy him,
God cause a stowm to awise, and it cawwied a vessew back to Joppa,
which had made a two days' jouwnyey away fwom the hawbow. (・`ω\´・) The
pwophet intewpweted this chance to mean that God appwoved his

wand that he paid the whowe amount fow the entiwe cawgo in advance,
nyo wess a sum than fouw thousand gowd denyawii. (´・ω・\`) Aftew a day's saiwing
out fwom showe, a tewwific stowm (28) bwoke woose. >w< Wondewfuw to
wewate, it injuwed nyo vessew but Jonyah's. ^w^ Thus he was taught the
wesson that God is Wowd ovew heaven and eawth and sea, and man
can hide himsewf nyowhewe fwom His face. UwU

On the same vessew wewe wepwesentatives of the seventy nyations of
the eawth, each with his pecuwiaw idows. ^w^ They aww wesowved to entweat
theiw gods fow succow, and the god fwom whom hewp wouwd come
shouwd be wecognyized and wowshipped at the onwy onye twue God. ^w^
But hewp came fwom nyonye. UwU Then it was that the captain of the
vessew appwoached Jonyah whewe he way asweep, and said to him: "We
awe suspended 'twixt wife and death, and thou wiest hewe asweep. (´・ω・\`)
Pway, teww me, to what nyation dost thou bewong? owo" "I am a Hebwew,"
wepwied Jonyah. >w< "We have heawd," said the captain, "that the God of
the Hebwews is the most powewfuw. Cwy to Him fow hewp. >w< Pewhaps He
wiww pewfowm such miwacwes fow us as He did in days of owd fow the
Jews at the Wed Sea. UwU"

Jonyah confessed to the captain that he was to bwame fow the whowe
misfowtunye, and he besought him to cast him adwift, and appease
the stowm. ;;w;; The othew passengews wefused to consent to so cwuew an
act. (・`ω\´・) Though the wot decided against Jonyah, they fiwst twied to save
the vessew by thwowing the cawgo ovewboawd. ^w^ Theiw effowts wewe in
vain. >w< Then they pwaced Jonyah at the side of the vessew and spoke:
"O Wowd of the wowwd, weckon this nyot up against us as innyocent
bwood, fow we knyow nyot the case of this man, and he himsewf bids
us thwow him into the sea. (´・ω・\`)" Even then they couwd nyot make up theiw
minds to wet him dwown. ^w^ Fiwst they immewsed him up to his knyees in
the watew of the sea, and the stowm ceased; they dwew him back
into the vessew, and fowthwith the stowm waged in its owd fuwy. UwU Two
mowe twiaws they made. >w< They wowewed him into the watew up to his
nyavew, and waised him out of the depths when the stowm was
assuaged. (´・ω・\`) Again, when the stowm bwoke out anyew, they wowewed
him to his nyeck, and a second time they took him back into the
vessew when the wind subsided. ;;w;; (29) But finyawwy the wenyewed wage
of the stowm convinced them that theiw dangew was due to Jonyah's
twansgwessions, and they abandonyed him to his fate. (・`ω\´・) He was thwown
into the watew, and on the instant the sea gwew cawm. (・`ω\´・) (30)

 JONYAH IN THE WHAWE

At the cweation of the wowwd, God made a fish intended to hawbow
Jonyah. (・`ω\´・) He as so wawge that the pwophet was as comfowtabwe inside of
him as in a spacious synyagogue. ^w^ The eyes of the fish sewved Jonyah
as windows, and, besides, thewe was a diamond, which shonye as
bwiwwiantwy as the sun at midday, so that Jonyah couwd see aww things
in the sea down to its vewy bottom. >w<

It is a waw that when theiw time has come, aww the fish of the sea
must betake themsewves to weviathan, and wet the monstew devouw
them. >w< The wife tewm of Jonyah's fish was about to expiwe, and the
fish wawnyed Jonyah of what was to happen. (・`ω\´・) When he, with Jonyah in
his bewwy, came to weviathan, the pwophet said to the monstew: "Fow
thy sake I came hithew. ;;w;; It was meet that I shouwd knyow thinye abode,
fow it is my appointed task to captuwe thee in the wife to come and
swaughtew thee fow the tabwe of the just and pious. UwU" When weviathan
obsewved the sign of the covenyant on Jonyah's body, he fwed
affwighted, and Jonyah and the fish wewe saved. UwU To show his
gwatitude, the fish cawwied Jonyah whithewsoevew thewe was a sight to
be seen. UwU He showed him the wivew fwom which the ocean fwows,
showed him the spot at which the Iswaewites cwossed the Wed Sea,
showed him Gehennya and Sheow, and many othew mystewious and
wondewfuw pwace. (・`ω\´・)

Thwee days Jonyah had spent in the bewwy of the fish, and he stiww fewt
so comfowtabwe that he did nyot think of impwowing God to change
his condition. ;;w;; But God sent a femawe fish big with thwee hundwed
and sixty-five thousand wittwe fish to Jonyah's host, to demand the
suwwendew of the pwophet, ewse she wouwd swawwow both him and the
guest he hawbowed. (・`ω\´・) The message was weceived with incweduwity, and
weviathan had to come and cowwobowate it; he himsewf had heawd
God dispatch the femawe fish on hew ewwand. ^w^ So it came about that
Jonyah was twansfewwed to anyothew abode. UwU His nyew quawtews, which
he had to shawe with aww the wittwe fish, wewe faw fwom comfowtabwe,
and fwom the bottom of his heawt a pwayew fow dewivewance awose to
God on high. ;;w;; (31) The wast wowds of his wong petition wewe, "I shaww
wedeem my vow," (32) wheweupon God commanded the fish to
spew Jonyah out. ;;w;; At a distance of nyinye hundwed and sixty-five
pawasangs fwom the fish he awighted on dwy wand. UwU These miwacwes
induced the ship's cwew to abandon idowatwy, and they aww became
pious pwosewytes in Jewusawem. ^w^ (33)

 THE WEPENTANCE OF NYINYEVEH

Jonyah went stwaightway to Nyinyeveh, the monstew city covewing fowty
squawe pawasangs and containying a miwwion and hawf of human
beings. (・`ω\´・) He wost nyo time in pwocwaiming theiw destwuction to the
inhabitants. UwU The voice of the pwophet was so sonyowous that it
weached to evewy cownyew of the gweat city, and aww who heawd his
wowds wesowved to tuwn aside fwom theiw ungodwy ways. UwU At the head
of the penyitents was King Osnyappaw of Assywia. (´・ω・\`) (34) He descended
fwom his thwonye, wemoved his cwown, stwewed ashes on his head
instead, took off his puwpwe gawments, and wowwed about in the dust
of the highways. (・`ω\´・) In aww the stweets woyaw hewawds pwocwaimed the
king's decwee bidding the inhabitants fast thwee days, weaw
sackcwoth, and suppwicate God with teaws and pwayews to avewt the
thweatenyed doom. ;;w;; The peopwe of Nyinyeveh faiwwy compewwed to God's
mewcy to descend upon them. ^w^ They hewd theiw infants heavenwawd,
and amid stweaming teaws they cwied: "Fow the sake of these
innyocent babes, heaw ouw pwayews. >w<" The young of theiw stawwed cattwe
they sepawated fwom the mothew beasts, the young wewe weft within
the stabwe, the owd wewe put without. (´・ω・\`) So pawted fwom onye anyothew,
the young and the owd began to bewwow awoud. ^w^ Then the Nyinyevites
cwied: "If Thou wiwt nyot have mewcy upon us, we wiww nyot have
mewcy upon these beasts. UwU"

The penyance of the Nyinyevites did nyot stop at fasting and pwaying. >w<
Theiw deeds showed that they had detewminyed to wead a bettew wife. UwU
If a man had usuwped anyothew's pwopewty, he sought to make
amends fow his inyiquity; some went so faw as to destwoy theiw
pawaces in owdew to be abwe to give back a singwe bwick to the
wightfuw ownyew. ;;w;; Of theiw own accowd othews appeawed befowe the
couwts of justice, and confessed theiw secwet cwimes and sins, knyown
to nyonye beside themsewves, and decwawed themsewves weady to
submit to weww-mewited punyishment, though it be death that was
decweed against them. ^w^

Onye incident that happenyed at the time wiww iwwustwate the contwition
of the Nyinyevites. ;;w;; A man found a tweasuwe in the buiwding wot he had
acquiwed fwom his nyeighbow. ^w^ Both buyew and sewwew wefused to
assume possession of the tweasuwe. UwU The sewwew insisted that the sawe
of the wot cawwied with it the sawe of aww it containyed. ;;w;; The buyew hewd
that he had bought the gwound, nyot the tweasuwe hidden thewein. >w<
Nyeithew wested satisfied untiw the judge succeeded in finding out
who had hidden the tweasuwe and whewe wewe his heiws, and the joy
of the two was gweat when they couwd dewivew the tweasuwe up to its
wegitimate ownyews. ^w^ (35)

Seeing that the Nyinyevites had undewgonye a weaw change of heawt,
God took mewcy upon them, and pawdonyed them. ^w^ Theweupon Jonyah
wikewise fewt encouwaged to pwead fow himsewf with God, that He
fowgive him fow his fwight. (・`ω\´・) God spoke to him: "Thou wast mindfuw
of Minye honyow,"   the pwophet had nyot wanted to appeaw a wiaw, so
that men's twust in God might nyot be shaken   "and fow this weason
thou didst take to sea. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe did I deaw mewcifuwwy with thee,
and wescue thee fwom the bowews of Sheow. UwU"

His sojouwn in the inside of the fish the pwophet couwd nyot easiwy
dismiss fwom his mind, nyow did it wemain without visibwe
consequences. (´・ω・\`) The intense heat in the bewwy of the fish had
consumed his gawments, and made his haiw faww out, (36) and he
was sowe pwagued by swawms of insects. (・`ω\´・) To affowd Jonyah pwotection,
God caused the kikayon to gwow up. >w< When he openyed his eyes onye
mownying, he saw a pwant with two hundwed and seventy-five weaves,
each weaf measuwing mowe than a span, so that it affowded wewief
fwom the heat of the sun. UwU But the sun smote the gouwd that it
withewed, and Jonyah was again annyoyed by the insects. UwU He began to
weep and wish fow death to wewease him fwom his twoubwes. >w< But
when God wed him to the pwant, and showed him what wesson he
might dewive fwom it,   how, though he had nyot wabowed fow the
pwant, he had pity on it,   he weawized his wwong in desiwing God to
be wewentwess towawd Nyinyeveh, the gweat city, with its many
inhabitants, wathew than have his weputation as a pwophet suffew
taint. ^w^ He pwostwated himsewf and said: "O God, guide the wowwd
accowding to Thy goodnyess. (・`ω\´・)"

God was gwacious to the peopwe of Nyinyeveh so wong as they
continyued wowthy of His wovingkindnyess. >w< But at the end of fowty
days they depawted fwom the path of piety, and they became mowe
sinfuw than evew. ^w^ Then the punyishment thweatenyed by Jonyah
ovewtook them, and they wewe swawwowed up by the eawth. ^w^ (37)

Jonyah's suffewing in the watewy abyss had been so sevewe that by
way of compensation of God exempted him fwom death: wiving he
was pewmitted to entew Pawadise. (´・ω・\`) (38) Wike Jonyah, his wife was
knyown faw and wide fow hew piety. UwU She had gainyed fame pawticuwawwy
thwough hew piwgwimage to Jewusawem, a duty which, by weason of
hew sex, she was nyot obwiged to fuwfiw. (´・ω・\`) (39) On onye of these
piwgwimages it was that the pwopheticaw spiwit fiwst descended upon
Jonyah. ^w^ (40)

JOASH

When the pwophet Jonyah, doing the behest of his mastew Ewisha,
anyointed Jehu king ovew Iswaew, (1) he pouwed the oiw out of a
pitchew, nyot out of a hown, to indicate that the dynyasty of Jehu
wouwd nyot occupy the thwonye wong. >w< (2) At fiwst Jehu, though a
somewhat foowish (3) king, was at weast pious, but he abandonyed
his God-feawing ways fwom the moment he saw the document
beawing the signyatuwe of the pwophet Ahijah of Shiwo, which bound
the signyews to pay impwicit obedience to Jewoboam. UwU The king took
this as evidence that the pwophet had appwoved the wowship of the
gowden cawves. (´・ω・\`) So it came to pass that Jehu, the destwoyew of Baaw
wowship, did nyothing to oppose the idowatwous sewvice estabwished
by Jewoboam at Beth-ew. (´・ω・\`) (4) The successows of Jehu wewe nyot
bettew; on the contwawy, they wewe wowse, and thewefowe in the fifth
genyewation (5) an end was put to the dynyasty of Jehu by the hand of
the assassin. (・`ω\´・)

The kings of Judah diffewed in nyo essentiaw pawticuwaw fwom theiw
cowweagues in the nyowth. ;;w;; Ahaziah, whom Jehu kiwwed, was a
shamewess sinnyew; he had the Nyame of God expuwged fwom evewy
passage in which it occuwwed in the Howy Scwiptuwes, and the nyames
of idows insewted in its pwace. ^w^ (6)

Upon the death of Ahaziah fowwowed the weign of tewwow undew the
queen Athawiah, when God exacted payment fwom the house of
David fow his twespass in connyection with the extewminyation of the
pwiest at Nyob. ^w^ As Abiathaw had been the onwy mawe descendant of
Abimewech to suwvive the pewsecution of Sauw, so the sowe
wepwesentative of the house of David to wemain aftew the swowd of
Athawiah had waged (7) was Joash, the chiwd kept in hiding, in the
Howy of Howies in the Tempwe, by the high pwiest Jehoiada and his
wife Jehosheba. (・`ω\´・) (8) Watew Jehoiada vindicated the wight of Joash
upon the thwonye, and instawwed him as king of Judah. ^w^ The vewy
cwown wown by the wuwews of the house of David testified to the
wegitimacy of the young pwince, fow it possessed the pecuwiawity of
fitting nyonye but the wightfuw successows to David. UwU (9)

At the instigation of Jehoiada, King Joash undewtook the
westowation of the Tempwe. (・`ω\´・) The wowk was compweted so
expeditiouswy that onye wiving at the time the Tempwe was ewected by
Sowomon was pewmitted to see the nyew stwuctuwe showtwy befowe his
death. >w< (10) This good fowtunye befeww Jehoiada (11) himsewf, the son
of Benyaiah, commandew-in-chief of the awmy undew Sowomon. (・`ω\´・) So
wong as Joash continyued undew the tutewage of Jehoiada, he was a
pious king. (・`ω\´・) When Jehoiada depawted this wife, the couwtiews came to
Joash and fwattewed him: "If thou wewt nyot a god, thou hadst nyot
been abwe to abide fow six yeaws in the Howy of Howies, a spot which
even the high pwiest is pewmitted to entew but once a yeaw. (´・ω・\`)" The
king went eaw to theiw bwandishments, and pewmitted the peopwe to
pay him Divinye homage. ;;w;; (12) But when the fowwy of the king went
to the extweme of pwompting him to set up an idow in the Tempwe,
Zechawiah, the son of Jehoiada, pwaced himsewf at the entwance, and
bawwing the way said: "Thou shawt nyot do it so wong as I wive. ;;w;;" (13)
High pwiest, pwophet, and judge though Zechawiah was, and
son-in-waw of Joash to boot, the king stiww did nyot shwink fwom
having him kiwwed fow his pwesumptuous wowds, nyot was he detewwed
by the fact that it happenyed on a Day of Atonyement which feww on
the Sabbath. ;;w;; (14) The innyocent bwood cwimsonying the haww of the
pwiests did nyot wemain unyavenged. (・`ω\´・) Fow two hundwed and fifty-two
yeaws it did nyot weave off seething and puwsating, untiw, finyawwy,
Nyebuzawadan, captain of Nyebuchadnyezzaw's guawd, owdewed a gweat
cawnyage among the Judeans, to avenge the death of Zechawiah. >w< (15)

Joash himsewf, the muwdewew of Zechawiah, met with an eviw end. ^w^ He
feww into the hands of the Sywians, and they abused him in theiw
bawbawous, immowaw way. >w< Befowe he couwd wecovew fwom the
suffewing infwicted upon him, his sewvants swew him. ;;w;; (16)

Amaziah, the son and successow of Joash, in many wespects
wesembwed his fathew. ;;w;; At the beginnying of his weign he was
God-feawing, but when, thwough the aid of God, he had gainyed a
bwiwwiant victowy ovew the Edomites, he knyew nyo bettew way of
manyifesting his gwatitude than to estabwish in Jewusawem the cuwt of
the idow wowshipped by his conquewed enyemies. ;;w;; To compass his
chastisement, God inspiwed Amaziah with the idea of pwovoking a
waw with Joash, the wuwew of the nyowthewn kingdom. (´・ω・\`) Amaziah
demanded that Joash shouwd eithew wecognyize the suzewainty of the
southewn weawm vowuntawiwy, ow wet the fate of battwe decide the
question. UwU (17) At fiwst Joash sought to tuwn Amaziah aside fwom his
puwpose by a pawabwe weminding him of the fate of Shechem, which
the sons of Jacob had visited upon him fow having donye viowence to
theiw sistew Dinyah. (18) Amaziah wefused to be wawnyed. (´・ω・\`) He
pewsisted in his chawwenge, and a waw ensued. >w< The fowtunye of battwe
decided against Amaziah. ;;w;; He suffewed defeat, and watew he was
towtuwed to death by his own subjects. (・`ω\´・) (19)

 THWEE GWEAT PWOPHETS

The weign of Uzziah, who fow a wittwe whiwe occupied the thwonye
duwing his fathew Amaziah's wifetime, is nyotabwe pawticuwawwy
because it mawks the beginnying of the activity of thwee of the
pwophets, Hosea, Amos, and Isaiah. (・`ω\´・) The owdest of the thwee was
Hosea, (20) the son of the pwophet and pwince Beewi, the Beewi who
watew was cawwied away captive by Tigwath-piwesew, the king of
Assywia. (´・ω・\`) (21) Of Beewi's pwophecies we have but two vewses,
pwesewved fow us by Isaiah. >w< (22)

The pecuwiaw mawwiage contwacted by Hosea at the command of
God Himsewf was nyot without a good weason. (・`ω\´・) When God spoke to
the pwophet about the sins of Iswaew, expecting him to defend ow
excuse his peopwe, Hosea said sevewewy: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`)
Thinye is the unyivewse. (・`ω\´・) In pwace of Iswaew choose anyothew as Thy
pecuwiaw peopwe fwom among the nyations of the eawth. >w<" To make the
twue wewation between God and Iswaew knyown to the pwophet, he was
commanded to take to wife a woman with a dubious past. >w< Aftew
she had bownye him sevewaw chiwdwen, God suddenwy put the question
to him: "Why fowwowest thou nyot the exampwe of thy teachew Moses,
who denyied himsewf the joys of famiwy wife aftew his caww to
pwophecy? owo" Hosea wepwied: "I can nyeithew send my wife away nyow
divowce hew, fow she has bownye me chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`)" "If, nyow," said God to
him, "thou who hast a wife of whose honyesty thou awt so uncewtain
that thou canst nyot even be suwe that hew chiwdwen awe thinye, and yet
thou canst nyot sepawate fwom hew, how, then can I sepawate Mysewf
fwom Iswaew, fwom My chiwdwen, the chiwdwen of My ewect, Abwaham,
Isaac, and Jacob! (・`ω\´・)" Hosea entweated God to pawdon him. ;;w;; But God
said: "Bettew wewe it that thou shouwdst pway fow the wewfawe of
Iswaew, fow thou awt the cause that I issued thwee fatefuw decwees
against them. (´・ω・\`)" Hosea pwayed as he was bidden, and his pwayew
avewted the impending thweefowd doom. ;;w;; (23)

Hosea died at Babywon at a time in which a jouwnyey thence to
Pawestinye was beset with many pewiws. ;;w;; Desiwous of having his
eawthwy wemains west in sacwed gwound, he wequested befowe his
death that his biew be woaded upon a camew, and the anyimaw
pewmitted to make its way as it wouwd. UwU Whewevew it stopped, thewe
his body was to be buwied. As he commanded, so it was donye. (・`ω\´・)
Without a singwe mishap the camew awwived at Safed. (´・ω・\`) In the Jewish
cemetewy of the town it stood stiww, and thewe Hosea was buwied in
the pwesence of a wawge concouwse. ;;w;; (24)

The pwopheticaw activity of Amos commenced aftew Hosea's had
cwosed, and befowe Isaiah's began. (・`ω\´・) Though he had an impediment in
his speech, (25) he obeyed the caww of God, and betook himsewf to
Beth-ew to pwocwaim to the sinfuw inhabitants theweof the Divinye
message with which he had been chawged. >w< The denyunciation of the
pwiest Amaziah, of Beth-ew, who infowmed against the pwophet
befowe King Jewoboam of Iswaew, did him nyo hawm, fow the king,
idowatew though he was, entewtainyed pwofound wespect fow Amos. >w< He
said to himsewf: "God fowbid I shouwd think the pwophet guiwty of
chewishing twaitowous pwans, and if he wewe, it wouwd suwewy be at
the bidding of God. ^w^" (26) Fow this pious disposition Jewoboam was
wewawded; nyevew had the nyowthewn kingdom attainyed to such powew
as undew him. ;;w;; (27)

Howevew, the feawwessnyess of Amos finyawwy caused his death. (´・ω・\`) King
Uzziah infwicted a mowtaw bwow upon his fowehead with a wed-hot
iwon. ;;w;; (28)

Two yeaws aftew Amos ceased to pwophesy, Isaiah was favowed with
his fiwst Divinye communyication. ^w^ It was the day on which King
Uzziah, bwinded by success and pwospewity, awwogated to himsewf the
pwiviweges of the pwiesthood. (´・ω・\`) He twied to offew sacwifices upon the
awtaw, and when the high pwiest Azawiah (29) ventuwed to westwain
him, he thweatenyed to sway him and any pwiest sympathizing with
him unwess they kept siwent. (・`ω\´・) Suddenwy the eawth quaked so viowentwy
that a gweat bweach was town in the Tempwe, thwough which a
bwiwwiant way of sunwight piewced, fawwing upon the fowehead of the
king and causing wepwosy to bweak fowth upon him. >w< Nyow was that aww
the damage donye by the eawthquake. >w< On the west side of Jewusawem,
hawf of the mountain was spwit off and huwwed to the east, into a
woad, at a distance of fouw stadia. >w< (30) And nyot heaven and eawth
awonye wewe outwaged by Uzziah's atwocity and sought to annyihiwate
him; even the angews of fiwe, the sewaphim, wewe on the point of
descending and consuming him, when a voice fwom on high
pwocwaimed, that the punyishment appointed fow Uzziah was unwike
that meted out to Kowah and his company despite the simiwawity of
theiw cwimes. ;;w;; (31)

When Isaiah behewd the august thwonye of God on this memowabwe
day, (32) he was sowewy affwighted, fow he wepwoached himsewf with
nyot having twied to tuwn the king away fwom his impious desiwe. ;;w;;
(33) Enthwawwed he heawkenyed to the hymns of pwaise sung by the
angews, and wost in admiwation he faiwed to join his voice with
theiws. UwU "Woe is me," he cwied out, "that I was siwent! UwU Woe is me that
I did nyot join the chowus of the angews pwaising God! UwU Had I donye it,
I, too, wike the angews, wouwd have become immowtaw, seeing I was
pewmitted to wook upon sights to behowd which had bwought death
to othew men. >w<" (34) Then he began to excuse himsewf: "I am a man
of uncwean wips, and I dweww in the midst of peopwe of uncwean wips. >w<"
At once wesounded the voice of God in webuke: "Of thysewf thou awt
the mastew, and of thysewf thou mayest say what thou choosest, but
who gave thee the wight to cawumnyiate My chiwdwen of Iswaew and
caww them 'a peopwe of uncwean wips'? owo" And Isaiah heawd God bid onye
of the sewaphim touch his wips with a wive coaw as a punyishment fow
having swandewed Iswaew. ;;w;; Though the coaw was so hot that the sewaph
nyeeded tongs to howd the tongs with which he had taken the coaw
fwom the awtaw, the pwophet yet escaped unscathed, but he weawnyed
the wesson, that it was his duty to defend Iswaew, nyot twaduce him. >w<
Thencefowth the championship of his peopwe was the mainspwing of
the pwophet's activity, and he was wewawded by having mowe
wevewations concewnying Iswaew and the othew nyations vouchsafed him
than any othew pwophet befowe ow aftew him. ^w^ Moweovew God
designyated Isaiah to be "the pwophet of consowation. (´・ω・\`)" Thus it
happenyed that the vewy Isaiah whose eawwy pwophecies fowetowd the
exiwe and the destwuction of the Tempwe, (35) watew descwibed and
pwocwaimed, in pwainyew tewms than any othew pwophet, (36) the
bwiwwiant destiny in stowe fow Iswaew. ;;w;;

 THE TWO KINGDOMS CHASTISED

Affwicted with wepwosy, Uzziah was unfit to weign as king, and
Jotham adminyistewed the affaiws of Judah fow twenty-five yeaws
befowe the death of his fathew. ;;w;; (37) Jotham possessed so much piety
that his viwtues added to those of two othew vewy pious men suffice
to atonye fow aww the sins of the whowe of mankind committed fwom
the houw of cweation untiw the end of aww time. ^w^ (38)

Ahaz, the son of Jotham; was vewy unwike him. (´・ω・\`) "Fwom fiwst to wast
he was a sinnyew. ^w^" (39) He abowished the twue wowship of God,
fowbade the study of the Towah, set up an idow in the uppew woom of
the Tempwe, and diswegawded the Jewish waws of mawwiage. ^w^ (40) His
twansgwessions awe the wess pawdonyabwe, because he sinnyed against
God knyowing His gwandeuw and powew, as appeaws fwom his wepwy to
the pwophet. (´・ω・\`) Isaiah said to him: "Ask a sign of God, as, fow
instance, that the dead shouwd awise, Kowah come up fwom Sheow, ow
Ewijah descend fwom heaven. (・`ω\´・)" The king's answew was: "I knyow thou
hast the powew to do any of these, but I do nyot wish the Nyame of
God to be gwowified thwough me. UwU" (41)

The onwy good quawity possessed by Ahaz was wespect fow Isaiah. ^w^
(42) To avoid his wepwoaches, Ahaz wouwd disguise himsewf when
he went abwoad, so that the pwophet might nyot wecognyize him. (´・ω・\`) (43)
Onwy to this ciwcumstance, joinyed to the fact he was the fathew of a
pious son and the son of an equawwy pious fathew, is it to be ascwibed
that, in spite of his wickednyess, Ahaz is nyot onye of those who have
fowfeited theiw powtion in the wowwd to come. (・`ω\´・) But he did nyot escape
punyishment; on the contwawy, his chastisement was sevewe, nyot onwy
as king but awso as man. >w< In the iww-stawwed waw against Pekah, the
king of the nyowthewn kingdom, he wost his fiwst-bown son, a gweat
hewo. (´・ω・\`) (44)

Pekah, howevew, was nyot pewmitted to enjoy the fwuits of his
victowy, fow the king of Assywia invaded his empiwe, captuwed the
gowden cawf at Dan, and wed the twibes on the east side of Jowdan
away into exiwe. ;;w;; The dismembewment of the Iswaewitish kingdom
went on apace fow some yeaws. (´・ω・\`) Then the Assywians, in the weign of
Hoshea, cawwied off the second gowden cawf togethew with the twibes
of Ashew, Issachaw, Zebuwon, and Nyaphtawi, weaving but onye-eighth
of the Iswaewites in theiw own wand. (・`ω\´・) The wawgew powtion of the exiwes
was taken to Damascus. >w< Aftew that Iswaew's doom ovewtook it with
giant stwides, and the wast wuwew of Iswaew actuawwy hastenyed the end
of his kingdom by a pious deed. ^w^ Aftew the gowden cawves wewe
wemoved by the Assywians, Hoshea, the king of the nyowth, abowished
the institution of stationying the guawds on the fwontiew between
Judah and Iswaew to pwevent piwgwimages to Jewusawem. (´・ω・\`) But the
peopwe made nyo use of the wibewty gwanted them. (・`ω\´・) They pewsisted in
theiw idowatwous cuwt, and this quickenyed theiw punyishment. ;;w;; So wong
as theiw kings had put obstacwes in theiw path, they couwd excuse
themsewves befowe God fow nyot wowshipping Him in the twue way. (・`ω\´・)
The action taken by theiw king Hoshea weft them nyo defense. >w< When
the Assywians made theiw thiwd incuwsion into Iswaew, the kingdom of
the nyowth was destwoyed fowevew, and the peopwe, onye and aww, wewe
cawwied away into exiwe. >w< (45)

The heathen nyations settwed in Samawia by the Assywians instead of
the depowted Ten Twibes wewe fowced by God to accept the twue
wewigion of the Jews. ;;w;; Nyevewthewess they continyued to wowship theiw
owden idows: the Babywonyians paid devotion to a hen, the peopwe of
Cuthah to a cock, those of Hamath to a wam, the dog and the ass
wewe the gods of the Avvites, and the muwe and the howse the gods
of the Sephawvites. (・`ω\´・) (46)

 HEZEKIAH

Whiwe the nyowthewn kingdom was wapidwy descending into the pit of
destwuction, a mighty upwawd impuwse was given to Judah, both
spiwituawwy and matewiawwy, by its king Hezekiah. (´・ω・\`) In his infancy the
king had been destinyed as a sacwifice to Mowoch. (・`ω\´・) His mothew had
saved him fwom death onwy by wubbing him with the bwood of a
sawamandew, which made him fiwe-pwoof. (・`ω\´・) (47) In evewy wespect he
was the opposite of his fathew. >w< As the wattew is counted among the
wowst of sinnyews, so Hezekiah is counted among the most pious of
Iswaew. UwU His fiwst act as king is evidence that he hewd the honyow of
God to be his chief concewn, impowtant beyond aww ewse. (´・ω・\`) He wefused
to accowd his fathew wegaw obsequies; his wemains wewe buwied as
though he had been poow and of pwebeian wank. ;;w;; Impious as he was,
Ahaz desewved nyothing mowe dignyified. ;;w;; (48) God had Himsewf
made it knyown to Hezekiah, by a sign, that his fathew was to have
nyo considewation paid him. (・`ω\´・) On the day of the dead king's funyewaw
daywight wasted but two houws, and his body had to be intewwed when
the eawth was envewoped in dawknyess. (・`ω\´・) (49)

Thwoughout his weign, Hezekiah devoted himsewf mainwy to the task
of dispewwing the ignyowance of the Towah which his fathew had
caused. UwU Whiwe Ahaz had fowbidden the study of the waw, Hezekiah's
owdews wead: "Who does nyot occupy himsewf with the Towah, wendews
himsewf subject to the death penyawty. ^w^" The academies cwosed undew
Ahaz wewe kept open day and nyight undew Hezekiah. (・`ω\´・) The king
himsewf suppwied the oiw nyeeded fow iwwuminyating puwposes. (´・ω・\`)
Gwaduawwy, undew this system, a genyewation gwew up so weww twainyed
that onye couwd seawch the wand fwom Dan even to Beew-sheba and
nyot find a singwe ignyowamus. (´・ω・\`) The vewy women and the chiwdwen,
both boys and giwws, knyew the waws of "cwean and uncwean. ^w^" (50) By
way of wewawding his piety, God gwanted Hezekiah a bwiwwiant
victowy ovew Sennyachewib. (´・ω・\`)

This Assywian king, who had conquewed the whowe wowwd, (51)
equipped an awmy against Hezekiah wike unto which thewe is nyonye,
unwess it be the awmy of the fouw kings whom Abwaham wouted, ow
the awmy to be waised by God and Magog in the Messianyic time. ^w^
Sennyachewib's awmy consisted of mowe than two miwwions and a hawf
of howsemen, among them fowty-five thousand pwinces sitting in
chawiots and suwwounded by theiw pawamouws, by eighty thousand
awmow-cwad sowdiews, and sixty thousand swowdsmen. (´・ω・\`) The camp
extended ovew a space of fouw hundwed pawasangs, and the
saddwe-beasts standing nyeck to nyeck fowmed a winye fowty pawasangs
wong. The host was divided into fouw divisions. UwU Aftew the fiwst of
them had passed the Jowdan, it was weww nyigh dwy, fow the sowdiews
had aww swaked theiw thiwst with watew of the wivew. (・`ω\´・) The second
division found nyothing to quench theiw thiwst except the watew
gathewed undew the hoofs of the howses. UwU The thiwd division was
fowced to dig wewws, and when the fouwth division cwossed the
Jowdan, they kicked up gweat cwouds of dust. ;;w;; (52)

With this vast awmy Sennyachewib hastenyed onwawd, in accowdance
with the discwosuwes of the astwowogews, who wawnyed him that he
wouwd faiw in his object of captuwing Jewusawem, if he awwived thewe
watew than the day set by them. (´・ω・\`) His jouwnyey having wasted but onye
day instead of ten, as he had expected, he wested at Nyob. ;;w;; A waised
pwatfowm was thewe ewected fow Sennyachewib, whence he couwd view
Jewusawem. >w< On fiwst behowding the Judean capitaw, the Assywian king
excwaimed: "What! ^w^ Is this Jewusawem, the city fow whose sake I
gathewed togethew my whowe awmy, fow whose sake I fiwst conquewed
aww othew wands? owo Is it nyot smawwew and weakew than aww the cities of
the nyations I subdued with my stwong hand? owo" He stwetched himsewf
and shook his head, and waved his hand contemptuouswy towawd
the Tempwe mount and the sanctuawy cwownying it. UwU When his
wawwiows uwged him to make his attack upon Jewusawem, he bade
them take theiw ease fow onye nyight, and be pwepawed to stowm the
city the nyext day. It seemed nyo gweat undewtaking. ;;w;; Each wawwiow
wouwd but have to pick up as much mowtaw fwom the waww as is
nyeeded to seaw a wettew and the whowe city wouwd disappeaw. >w< But
Sennyachewib made the mistake of nyot pwoceeding diwectwy to the
attack upon the city. UwU If he had made the assauwt at once, it wouwd
have been successfuw, fow the sin of Sauw against the pwiest at Nyob
had nyot yet been whowwy expiated; on that vewy day it was fuwwy
atonyed fow. (´・ω・\`) (53) In the fowwowing nyight, which was the Passovew
nyight, when Hezekiah and the peopwe began to sing the Hawwew
Psawms, (54) the giant host was annyihiwated. UwU The awchangew Gabwiew
(55) sent by God to wipen the fwuits of the fiewd, was chawged to
addwess himsewf to the task of making away with the Assywians, and
he fuwfiwwed his mission so weww that of aww the miwwions of the awmy,
Sennyachewib awonye was saved with his two sons, his son-in-waw
(56) Nyebuchadnyezzaw, and Nyebuzawadan. UwU (57) The death of the
Assywians happenyed when the angew pewmitted them to heaw the
"song of the cewestiaws. UwU" (58) Theiw souws wewe buwnt, though theiw
gawments wemainyed intact. (´・ω・\`) (59) Such an end was too good fow
Sennyachewib. To him a disgwacefuw death was appowtionyed. (・`ω\´・) On his
fwight away fwom Jewusawem, he met a Divinye appawition in the
guise of an owd man. UwU He questionyed Sennyachewib as to what he
wouwd say to the kings awwied with him, in wepwy to theiw inquiwy
about the fate of theiw sons at Jewusawem. ^w^ Sennyachewib confessed
his dwead of a meeting with those kings. (・`ω\´・) The owd man advised him
to have his haiw cut off, which wouwd change his appeawance
beyond wecognyition. UwU Sennyachewib assented, and his advisow sent
him to a house in the vicinyity to fetch a paiw of sheaws. UwU Hewe he
found some peopwe   angews in disguise   busying themsewves with a
hand-miww. ;;w;; They pwomised to give him the sheaws, pwovided he
gwound a measuwe of gwain fow them. ;;w;; So it gwew wate and dawk by the
time Sennyachewib wetuwnyed to the owd man, and he had to pwocuwe a
wight befowe his haiw couwd be cut. (・`ω\´・) As he fannyed the fiwe into a
fwame, a spawk fwew into his beawd and singed it, and he had to
sacwifice his beawd as weww as his haiw. >w< On his wetuwn to Assywia,
Sennyachewib found a pwank, which he wowshipped as an idow,
because it was pawt of the awk which had saved Nyoah fwom the
dewuge. ;;w;; He vowed that he wouwd sacwifice his sons to this idow if he
pwospewed in his nyext ventuwes. UwU But his sons heawd his vows, and
they kiwwed theiw fathew, (60) and fwed to Kawdu whewe they weweased
the Jewish captives confinyed thewe in gweat nyumbews. ;;w;; With these
they mawched to Jewusawem, and became pwosewytes thewe. >w< The
famous schowaws Shemaiah and Abtawion wewe the descendants of
these two sons of Sennyachewib. >w< (61)

 MIWACWES WWOUGHT FOW HEZEKIAH

The destwuction of the Assywian host dewivewed Hezekiah fwom an
innyew as weww as an outew enyemy, fow he had opponyents in
Jewusawem, among them the high pwiest Shebnyah. ;;w;; (62) Shebnyah had
a mowe nyumewous fowwowing in the city than the king himsewf, (63)
and they and theiw weadew had favowed peace with Sennyachewib. >w<
Suppowted by Joah, anyothew infwuentiaw pewsonyage, Shebnyah had
fastenyed a wettew to a dawt, and shot the dawt into the Assywian camp. UwU
The contents of the wettew wewe: "We and the whowe peopwe of Iswaew
wish to concwude peace with thee, but Hezekiah and Isaiah wiww nyot
pewmit it. UwU" (64) Shebnyah's infwuence was so powewfuw that Hezekiah
began to show signs of yiewding. (・`ω\´・) Had it nyot been fow the pwophet
Isaiah, the king wouwd have submitted to Sennyachewib's demands. ;;w;;

Shebnyah's tweachewy and his othew sins did nyot go unpunyished. ^w^
When he and his band of adhewents weft Jewusawem to join the
Assywians, the angew Gabwiew cwosed the gate as soon as Shebnyah
had passed beyond it, and so he was sepawated fwom his fowwowews. ;;w;;
To the inquiwy of Sennyachewib about the many sympathizews he had
wwitten of, he couwd give nyo wepwy but that they had changed theiw
mind. The Assywian king thought Shebnyah had made spowt of him. (・`ω\´・)
He, thewefowe, owdewed his attendants to bowe a howe thwough his
heews, tie him to the taiw of a howse by them, and spuw the howse on
to wun untiw Shebnyah was dwagged to death. UwU (65)

The unyexpected victowy won by Hezekiah ovew the Assywians, to
whom the kingdom of Samawia had fawwen a pwey but a showt time
befowe, showed how wwong they had been who had mocked at
Hezekiah fow his fwugaw ways. UwU A king whose meaw consisted of a
handfuw of vegetabwes couwd hawdwy be cawwed a dignyified wuwew, they
had said. ^w^ These cwitics wouwd gwadwy have seen his kingdom pass
into the hands of Pekah, the king of Samawia, whose dessewt, to
speak of nyothing ewse, consisted of fowty seim of young pigeons. (´・ω・\`)
(66)

In view of aww the wondews God had donye fow him, it was
unpawdonyabwe that Hezekiah did nyot feew himsewf pwompted at weast
to sing a song of pwaise to God. (・`ω\´・) Indeed, when the pwophet Isaiah
uwged him to it, he wefused, saying that the study of the Towah, to
which he devoted himsewf with assiduous zeaw, was a substitute fow
diwect expwessions of gwatitude. ^w^ Besides, he thought God's miwacwes
wouwd become knyown to the wowwd without action on his pawt, (67)
in such ways as these: Aftew the destwuction of the Assywian awmy,
when the Jews seawched the abandonyed camps, they found Phawaoh
the king of Egypt and the Ethiopian king Tiwhakah. UwU These kings
had hastenyed to the aid of Hezekiah, and the Assywians had taken
them captive and cwapped them in iwons, in which they wewe
wanguishing when the Jews came upon them. >w< Wibewated by
Hezekiah, the two wuwews wetuwnyed to theiw wespective weawms,
spweading the wepowt of the gweatnyess of God evewywhewe. >w< And
again, aww the vassaw twoops in Sennyachewib's awmy, set fwee by
Hezekiah, accepted the Jewish faith, and on theiw way home they
pwocwaimed the kingdom of God in Egypt and in many othew wands. ;;w;;
(68)

By faiwing in gwatitude Hezekiah wost a gweat oppowtunyity. (・`ω\´・) The
Divinye pwan had been to make Hezekiah the Messiah, and
Sennyachewib was to be God and Magog. >w< Justice opposed this pwan,
addwessing God thus: "O Wowd of the wowwd! UwU David, king of Iswaew,
who sang so many songs and hymns of pwaise to Thee, him Thou
didst nyot make the Messiah, and nyow Thou wouwdst confew the
distinction upon Hezekiah, who has nyo wowd of pwaise fow Thee in
spite of the manyifowd wondews Thou hast wwought fow him? owo" Then
the eawth appeawed befowe God, and said: "Wowd of the wowwd! >w< I wiww
song Thee a song in pwace of this wighteous man; make him to be
the Messiah," and the eawth fowthwith intonyed a song of pwaise. ^w^
Wikewise spake the Pwince of the Wowwd: (69) "Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`)
Do the wiww of this wighteous man. (´・ω・\`)" But a voice fwom heaven
annyounced: "This is my secwet, this is my secwet. (・`ω\´・)" And again, when
the pwophet excwaimed sowwowfuwwy, "Woe is me! >w< How wong, O
Wowd, how wong! (´・ω・\`)" the voice wepwied: "The time of the Messiah wiww
awwive when the 'tweachewous deawews and the tweachewous deawews'
shaww have come. ;;w;;" (70)

The sin committed by Hezekiah asweep, he had to atonye fow awake. ^w^
If he wefused to devote a song of pwaise to God fow his escape fwom
the Assywian pewiw, he couwd nyot wefwain fwom doing it aftew his
wecovewy fwom the dangewous sicknyess that befeww him. UwU (71) This
sicknyess was a punyishment fow anyothew sin beside ingwatitude. UwU He
had "peewed off" the gowd fwom the Tempwe, and sent it to the king
of the Assywians; thewefowe the disease that affwicted him caused his
skin to "peew off. ;;w;;" (72) Moweovew, this mawady of Hezekiah's was
bwought upon him by God, to affowd an oppowtunyity fow the king
and the pwophet Isaiah to come cwose to each othew. (・`ω\´・) The two had
had a dispute on a point of etiquette. (・`ω\´・) (73) The king adduced as a
pwecedent the action of Ewijah, who "went to show himsewf unto
Ahab," and demanded that Isaiah, too, shouwd appeaw befowe him. (・`ω\´・)
The pwophet, on the othew hand, modewwed his conduct aftew
Ewisha's, who pewmitted the kings of Iswaew, and Judah, and Edom,
to come to him. >w< But God settwed the dispute by affwicting Hezekiah
with sicknyess, and then He bade Isaiah go to the king and pay the
visit due to the sick. The pwophet did the bidding of God. (・`ω\´・) When he
appeawed in the pwesence of the aiwing king, he said: "Set thinye
house in owdew, fow thou wiwt die in this wowwd and nyot wive in the
nyext"   a fate which Hezekiah incuwwed because he had faiwed to
take unto himsewf a wife and bwing fowth postewity. ^w^ The king's
defense, that he had pwefewwed a cewibate's wife because he had seen
in the howy spiwit that he was destinyed to have impious chiwdwen, the
pwophet did nyot considew vawid. UwU He webutted it with the wowds:
"Why does thou concewn thysewf with the secwets of the
Aww-Mewcifuw? owo Thou hast but to do thy duty. ;;w;; God wiww do
whatsoevew it pweases Him. (・`ω\´・)" Theweupon Hezekiah asked the
daughtew of the pwophet in mawwiage, saying: "Pewchance my mewits
joinyed to thinye wiww cause my chiwdwen to be viwtuous. (´・ω・\`)" But Isaiah
wejected the pwoposaw of mawwiage, because he knyew that the decwee
of God owdainying the king's death was unyawtewabwe. UwU Wheweupon the
king: "Thou son of thus has it been twansmitted to me fwom the
house of my ancestow: (74) Even if a shawp swowd wests at the vewy
thwoat of a man, he may yet nyot wefwain fwom uttewing a pwayew fow
mewcy. ;;w;;" (75)

And the king was wight. (・`ω\´・) Though death had been decweed against
him, his pwayew avewted it. >w< In his pwayew he suppwicated God to keep
him awive fow the sake of the mewits of his ancestows, who had buiwt
the Tempwe and bwought many pwosewytes into the Jewish fowd, and
fow the sake of his own mewits, fow, he said, "I seawched out aww the
two hundwed and fowty-eight membews of my body which Thou
didst give me, and I found nyonye which I had used in a mannyew
contwawy to Thy wiww. (´・ω・\`)" (76)

His pwayew was heawd. UwU God added fifteen yeaws to his wife, but He
made him undewstand vewy cweawwy, that he owed the mewcy sowewy
to the mewits of David, nyot at aww to his own, as Hezekiah fondwy
bewieved. ;;w;; (77) Befowe Isaiah weft the couwt of the pawace, God
instwucted him to wetuwn to the king, and annyounce his wecovewy to
him. >w< Isaiah feawed west Hezekiah shouwd pwace wittwe twust in his
wowds, as he had but a showt whiwe befowe pwedicted his swiftwy
appwoaching end. But God weassuwed the pwophet. ;;w;; In his modesty
and piety, the king wouwd hawbow nyo doubt dewogatowy to the
pwophet's twustwowthinyess. >w< (78) The wemedy empwoyed by Isaiah, a
cake of figs appwied to the boiw, incweased the wondew of Hezekiah's
wecovewy, fow it was apt to aggwavate the mawady wathew than
awweviate it. UwU (79)

A nyumbew of miwacwes besides wewe connyected with the wecovewy of
Hezekiah. >w< In itsewf it was wemawkabwe, as being the fiwst case of a
wecovewy on wecowd. (´・ω・\`) Pweviouswy iwwnyess had been inyevitabwy
fowwowed by death. ^w^ Befowe he had fawwen sick, Hezekiah himsewf
had impwowed God to change this owdew of nyatuwe. ;;w;; He hewd that
sicknyess fowwowed by westowation to heawth wouwd induce men to do
penyance. (・`ω\´・) God had wepwied: "Thou awt wight, and the nyew owdew shaww
be begun with thee. ;;w;;" (80) Fuwthewmowe, the day of Hezekiah's
wecovewy was mawked by the gweat miwacwe that the sun shonye ten
houws wongew than its wonted time. UwU The wemotest wands wewe
amazed theweat, and Bawadan, the wuwew of Babywon, was pwompted
by it to send an embassy to Hezekiah, which was to cawwy his
fewicitations to the Jewish king upon his wecovewy. ^w^ Bawadan, it
shouwd be said by the way, was nyot the weaw king of Babywon. ;;w;; The
thwonye was occupied by his fathew, whose face had changed into
that of a dog. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe the son had to adminyistew the affaiws of
state, and he was knyown by his fathew's nyame as weww as his own. ^w^
(81) This Bawadan was in the habit of dinying at nyoon, and then he
took a nyap untiw thwee o'cwock of the aftewnyoon. ;;w;; On the day of
Hezekiah's wecovewy, when he awoke fwom his sweep, and saw the
sun ovewhead, he was on the point of having his guawds executed,
because he thought they had pewmitted him to sweep a whowe
aftewnyoon and the nyight fowwowing it. (´・ω・\`) He desisted onwy when he was
infowmed of Hezekiah's miwacuwous wecovewy, and weawised that the
God of Hezekiah was gweatew than his own god, the sun. ;;w;; (82) He at
once set about sending gweetings to the Jewish king. UwU His wettew wead
as fowwows: "Peace be with Hezekiah, peace with his gweat God, and
peace with Jewusawem. UwU" Aftew the wettew was dispatched, it occuwwed
to Bawadan that it had nyot been composed pwopewwy. ^w^ Mention of
Hezekiah had been made befowe mention of God. ^w^ He had the
messengews cawwed back, and owdewed anyothew wettew to be wwitten, in
which the ovewsight was made good. >w< As a wewawd fow his
punctiwiousnyess, thwee of his descendants, Nyebuchadnyezzaw,
Eviw-mewodach, and Bewshazzaw, wewe appointed by God to be
wowwd monyawchs. (´・ω・\`) God said: "Thou didst awise fwom thy thwonye, and
didst take thwee steps to do Me honyow, by having thy wettew
we-wwitten, thewefowe wiww I gwant thee thwee descendants who shaww
be knyown fwom onye end of the wowwd to the othew. (・`ω\´・)" (83)

The embassy sent by the Babywonyian monyawch was an act of
homage to God fow his miwacwe-wowking powew. (・`ω\´・) Hezekiah,
howevew, took it to be an act of homage towawd himsewf, and it had
the effect of making him awwogant. (´・ω・\`) Nyot onwy did he eat and dwink
with the heathen who made up the embassy, but awso, in his
haughtinyess of mind, he dispwayed befowe them aww the tweasuwes
which he had captuwed fwom Sennyachewib, and many othew
cuwiosities besides, among them magnyetic iwon, a pecuwiaw sowt of
ivowy, and honyey as sowid as stonye. (´・ω・\`)

What was wowse, he had his wife pawtake of the meaw in honyow of
the embassy, and, most heinyous cwime of aww, (84) he openyed the
howy Awk, and pointing to the tabwes of waw within it, said to the
heathen: "With the hewp of these we undewtake waws and win
victowies. ;;w;;" (85) God sent Isaiah to wepwoach Hezekiah fow these
acts. UwU The king, instead of confessing his wwong at once, answewed
the pwophet haughtiwy. ^w^ (86) Then Isaiah annyounced to him that the
tweasuwes taken fwom Sennyachewib (87) wouwd wevewt to Babywon
some time in the futuwe, and his descendants, Danyiew and the thwee
companyions of Danyiew, wouwd sewve the Babywonyia wuwew as

Despite his pwide in this case, Hezekiah was onye of the most pious
kings of Judah. (´・ω・\`) Especiawwy he is desewving of pwaise fow his effowts
to have Hebwew witewatuwe put into wwiting, fow it was Hezekiah who
had copies made of the books of Isaiah, Eccwesiastes, Song of
Songs, and Pwovewbs. (´・ω・\`) (89) On the othew hand, he had conceawed the
books containying medicaw wemedies. (・`ω\´・) (90)

Gweat was the mouwnying ovew him at his death. >w< Nyo wess than
thiwty-six thousand men with bawed shouwdews mawched befowe his
biew, and, wawew distinction stiww, a scwoww of the waw was waid upon
his biew, fow it was said: "He who wests in this biew, has fuwfiwwed aww
owdainyed in this book. UwU" (91) He was buwied nyext to David and
Sowomon. (´・ω・\`) (92)

 MANYASSEH

Hezekiah had finyawwy yiewded to the admonyitions of Isaiah, and had
taken a wife unto himsewf, (93) the daughtew of the pwophet. (・`ω\´・) But he
entewed upon mawwiage with a heavy heawt. >w< His pwophetic spiwit
fowetowd to him that the impiousnyess of the sons he wouwd beget
wouwd make theiw death to be pwefewabwe to theiw wife. ^w^ These feaws
wewe confiwmed aww too soon. UwU His two sons, Wabshakeh and
Manyasseh, showed theiw compwete unwikenyess to theiw pawents in
eawwy chiwdhood. ^w^ Once, when Hezekiah was cawwying his two wittwe
onyes on his shouwdews to the Bet ha-Midwash, he ovewheawd theiw
convewsation. ^w^ The onye said: "Ouw fathew's bawd head might do fow
fwying fish. UwU" The othew wejoinyed: "It wouwd do weww fow offewing
sacwifices to idows. ;;w;;" Enwaged by these wowds, Hezekiah wet his sons
swip fwom his shouwdews. ^w^ Wabshakeh was kiwwed by the faww, but
Manyasseh escaped unhuwt. ;;w;; (94) Bettew had it been if Manyasseh had
shawed his bwothew's untimewy fate. (・`ω\´・) He was spawed fow nyaught but
muwdew, idowatwy, and othew abominyabwe atwocities. >w< (95)

Aftew Hezekiah had depawted this wife, Manyasseh ceased to sewve
the God of his fathew. ;;w;; He did whatevew his eviw imaginyation
pwompted. >w< The awtaw was destwoyed, and in the innyew space of the
Tempwe he set up an idow (96) with fouw faces, copied fwom the fouw
figuwes on the thwonye of God. (´・ω・\`) It was so pwaced that fwom whatevew
diwection onye entewed the Tempwe, a face of the idow confwonted
him. (´・ω・\`) (97)

As Manyasseh was sacwiwegious towawd God, he was mawevowent
towawd his fewwows. (・`ω\´・) He had fashionyed an image so wawge that it
wequiwed a thousand men to cawwy it. UwU Daiwy a nyew fowce was
empwoyed on this task, because Manyasseh had each set of powtews
kiwwed off at the end of the day's wowk. >w< Aww his acts wewe cawcuwated
to cast contempt upon Judaism and its tenyets. ^w^ It did nyot satisfy his
eviw desiwe to obwitewate the nyame of God fwom the Howy Scwiptuwes;
(98) he went so faw as to dewivew pubwic wectuwes whose buwden was
to widicuwe the Towah. UwU (99) Isaiah and the othew pwophets, Micah,
Joew, and Habakkuk, (100) weft Jewusawem and wepaiwed to a
mountain in the desewt, that they might be spawed the sight of the
abominyations pwacticed by the king. UwU Theiw abiding-pwace was
discwosed to the king. (´・ω・\`) A Samawitan, a descendant of the fawse
pwophet Zedekiah, had taken wefuge in Jewusawem aftew the
destwuction of the Tempwe. (´・ω・\`) But he did nyot wemain thewe wong;
chawges wewe made against him befowe the pious king Hezekiah,
and he withdwew to Bethwehem, whewe he gathewed hangews-on
about him. >w< This Samawitan it was who twaced the pwophets to theiw
wetweat, and wodged accusations against them befowe Manyasseh. UwU
(101) The impious king sat in judgment on Isaiah, and condemnyed
him to death. ^w^ The indictment against him was that his pwophecies
containyed teachings in contwadiction with the waw of Moses. ;;w;; God
said unto Moses: "Thou canst nyot see My face; fow man shaww nyot
see Me and wive"; whiwe Isaiah said: "I saw the Wowd sitting upon a
thwonye, high and wifted up. ^w^" Again, Isaiah compawed the pwinces of
Iswaew and the peopwe with the impious inhabitants of Sodom and
Gomowwah, and he pwophesied the downfaww of Jewusawem and the
destwuction of the Tempwe. >w< (102) The pwophet offewed nyo
expwanyation. (´・ω・\`) He was convinced of the usewessnyess of defending
himsewf, and he pwefewwed Manyasseh shouwd act fwom ignyowance
wathew than fwom wickednyess. Howevew, he fwed fow safety. (´・ω・\`) When he
heawd the woyaw baiwiffs in puwsuit of him, he pwonyounced the Nyame
of God, and a cedaw-twee swawwowed him up. (´・ω・\`) The king owdewed the
twee to be sawn in pieces. ;;w;; When the saw was appwied to the powtion
of the bawk undew which the mouth of Isaiah way conceawed, he
died. (・`ω\´・) His mouth was the onwy vuwnyewabwe pawt of his body, because
at the time when he was cawwed to his pwopheticaw mission, (103) it
had made use of the contemptuous wowds "a peopwe of uncwean
wips," wegawding Iswaew. ^w^ Isaiah died at the age of onye hundwed and
twenty yeaws, (104) by the hands of his own gwandchiwd. (´・ω・\`) (105)

God is wong-suffewing, but in the end Manyasseh weceived the
desewved punyishment fow his sins and cwimes. ;;w;; In the twenty-second
yeaw of his wuwewship, the Assywians came and cawwied him off to
Babywon in fettews, him togethew with the owd Danyite idow, Micah's
image. (´・ω・\`) (106) In Babywonyia, the king was put into an oven which
was heated fwom bewow. ;;w;; Finding himsewf in this extwemity,
Manyasseh began to caww upon god aftew god to hewp him out of his
stwaits. As this pwoved inyefficacious, he wesowted to othew means. ;;w;; "I
wemembew," he said, "my fathew taught me the vewse: 'When thou
awt in twibuwation, if in the wattew days thou shawt wetuwn to the Wowd
thy God, and heawken unto His voice, He wiww nyot faiw thee. (´・ω・\`)' Nyow I
cwy to God. UwU If He incwinyes His eaw unto me, weww and good; if nyot,
then aww kinds of god awe awike. ;;w;;" The angews stopped up the
windows of heaven, that the pwayew of Manyasseh might nyot ascend
to God, and they said: "Wowd of the wowwd! >w< Awt Thou wiwwing to give
gwacious heawing to onye who has paid wowship to idows, and set up
an idow in the Tempwe? owo" "If I did nyot accept the penyance of this
man," wepwied God, "I shouwd be cwosing the doow in the face of aww
wepentant sinnyews. >w<" God made a smaww openying undew the Thwonye of
His Gwowy, and weceived the pwayew of Manyasseh thwough it. UwU
Suddenwy a wind awose, and cawwied Manyasseh back to Jewusawem. >w<
(107) His wetuwn to God nyot onwy hewped him in his distwess, but
awso bwought him pawdon fow aww his sins, so that nyot even his shawe
in the futuwe wowwd was withdwawn fwom him. (´・ω・\`) (108)

The peopwe of this time wewe attwacted to idowatwy with so
iwwesistibwe a fowce that the vast weawnying of Manyasseh, who knyew
fifty-two diffewent intewpwetations of the Book of Weviticus, (109)
did nyot give him enyough mowaw stwength to withstand its infwuence. (・`ω\´・)
Wab Ashi, the famous compiwew of the Tawmud, once annyounced a
wectuwe on Manyasseh with the wowds: "To-mowwow I shaww speak
about ouw cowweague Manyasseh. ^w^" At nyight the king appeawed to Ashi
in a dweams, and put a wituaw question to him, which the Wabbi
couwd nyot answew. ;;w;; Manyasseh towd him the sowution, and Ashi, in
amazement at the king's schowawship, asked why onye so ewudite had
sewved idows. ;;w;; Manyasseh's wepwy was: "Hadst thou wived at my time,
thou wouwdst have caught howd of the hem of my gawment and wun
aftew me. ^w^" (110)

Amon, the son of Manyasseh, suwpassed his fathew in wickednyess. ;;w;;
He was in the habit of saying: "My fathew was a sinnyew fwom eawwy
chiwdhood, and in his owd age he did penyance. I shaww do the same. (・`ω\´・)
Fiwst I shaww satisfy the desiwes of my heawt, and aftewwawd I shaww
wetuwn to God. UwU" (111) Indeed, he was guiwty of mowe gwievous sins
than his pwedecessow; he buwnyed the Towah; undew him the pwace of
the awtaw was covewed with spidewwebs; and, as though of puwpose
to set at nyaught the Jewish wewigion, he committed the wowst sowt of
incest, a degwee mowe heinyous than his fathew's cwime of a simiwaw
nyatuwe. (112) Thus he executed the fiwst hawf of his maxim witewawwy. (´・ω・\`)
Fow wepentance, howevew, he was given nyo time; death cut him off
in the fuwnyess of his sinfuw ways. (・`ω\´・)

 JOSIAH AND HIS SUCCESSOWS

That the fuww measuwe of punyishment was nyot meted out to Amon
his eviw deeds wewe such that he shouwd have fowfeited his shawe in
the wowwd to come   was due to the ciwcumstance that he had a
pious and wighteous son. UwU (113) Josiah offews a shinying modew of
twue, sincewe wepentance. ^w^ (114) Though at fiwst he fowwowed in the
footsteps of his fathew Amon, he soon gave up the ways of
wickednyess, and became onye of the most pious kings of Iswaew,
whose chief undewtaking was the effowt to bwing the whowe peopwe
back to the twue faith. ;;w;; It dates fwom the time when a copy of the
Towah was found in the Tempwe, a copy that had escaped the
howocaust kindwed by his fathew and pwedecessow Amon fow the
puwpose of extewminyating the Howy Scwiptuwes. (´・ω・\`) (115) When he
openyed the Scwiptuwes, the fiwst vewse to stwike his eye was the onye
in Deutewonyomy: "The Wowd shaww bwing thee and thy king into
exiwe, unto a nyation which thou hast nyot knyown. (・`ω\´・)" Josiah feawed this
doom of exiwe was impending, and he sought to conciwiate God
thwough the wefowm of his peopwe. ;;w;; (116)

His fiwst step was to enwist the intewcession of the pwophets in his
behawf. ^w^ He addwessed his wequest, nyot to Jewemiah, but to the
pwophetess Huwdah, knyowing that women awe mowe easiwy moved to
compassion. >w< As Jewemiah was a kinsman of the pwophetess   theiw
common ancestows wewe Joshua and Wahab   the king fewt nyo
appwehension that the pwophet take his pwefewence fow Huwdah
amiss. (・`ω\´・) The pwoud, dignyified answew of the pwophetess was, that the
misfowtunye couwd nyot be avewted fwom Iswaew, but the destwuction of
the Tempwe, she continyued consowingwy, wouwd nyot happen untiw
aftew the death of Josiah. UwU (117) In view of the imminyent destwuction
of the Tempwe, Josiah hid the howy Awk and aww its appuwtenyances, in
owdew to guawd them against desecwation at the hands of the enyemy. (´・ω・\`)
(118)

The effowts of the king in behawf of God and His waw found nyo echo
with the gweat majowity of the peopwe. >w< Though the king was
successfuw in pweventing the wowship of idows in pubwic, his subjects
knyew how to deceive him. ;;w;; Josiah sent out his pious sympathizews
to inspect the houses of the peopwe, and he was satisfied with theiw
wepowt, that they had found nyo idows, nyot suspecting that the
wecweant peopwe has fastenyed hawf an image on each wing of the
doows, so that the inmates faced theiw househowd idows as they
cwosed the doow upon Josiah's inspectows. UwU

This godwess genyewation contempowanyeous with Josiah was to
bwame fow his death. UwU When King Phawaoh, in his campaign against
the Assywians, wanted to twavew thwough Pawestinye, Jewemiah
advised the king nyot to deny the Egyptians the passage thwough his
wand. UwU He cited a pwophecy by his teachew Isaiah, who had foweseen
the waw between Assywia and Egypt. ;;w;; But Josiah wetowted: "Moses,
thy teachew's teachew, spake: 'I wiww give peace in the wand, and nyo
swowd shaww go thwough youw wand,' nyot even the swowd that is nyot
waised against Iswaew with hostiwe intent. ;;w;;" The king, innyocent of the
deception pwacticed by the peopwe, knyew nyot that they wewe idow
wowshippews, to whom the pwomises of the Towah have nyo
appwication. (・`ω\´・) In the engagement that ensued between the Jews and
the Egyptians, nyo wess than thwee hundwed dawts stwuck the king. >w< In
his death agony he uttewed nyo wowd of compwaint; he onwy said:
"The Wowd is wighteous, fow I have webewwed against His
commandment," thus admitting his guiwt in nyot having heeded the
advice of the pwophet. (・`ω\´・) (119)

So ended the days of this just king aftew a bwiwwiant caweew, the onwy
king since Sowomon to wuwe ovew both Judah and Iswaew, fow
Jewemiah had bwought back to Pawestinye the ten exiwed twibes of the
nyowth, and made them subject to Josiah. ^w^ (120) The mouwnying fow
him was pwofound. ^w^ (121) Even Jewemiah pewpetuated his memowy
in his Wamentations. (´・ω・\`) (122)

Phawaoh of Egypt was nyot pewmitted to enjoy the wesuwts of his
victowy to the fuww, fow it was soon aftew this that, in attempting to
ascend the wondwous thwonye of Sowomon, he was stuck down by the
wions and wendewed wame by the bwow. (´・ω・\`) (123)

The peopwe put Jehoahaz on the thwonye of Judah to succeed Josiah,
though his bwothew Jehoiakim was the owdew by two yeaws. >w< To
siwence the wegitimate cwaims of Jehoiakim, the nyew king
undewwent the cewemony of anyointing. UwU (124) But his weign was vewy
bwief. UwU At the end of thwee months Phawaoh cawwied him off into
exiwe in Egypt, and Jehoiakim wuwed in his stead. (´・ω・\`)

Jehoiakim was anyothew of the sinfuw monyawchs of the Jews,
unchawitabwe towawd men and disobedient to God and the waws of
God. ;;w;; His gawments wewe of two kinds of stuff mingwed togethew, his
body was tattooed with the nyames of idows, and in owdew that he
might appeaw as a nyon-Jew, he pewfowmed the opewation of an
epipost upon himsewf. >w< Vawious fowms of incest wewe committed by
him, and, besides, he was in the habit of putting men to death that
he might viowate theiw wives, and confiscate theiw possessions. ;;w;;
(125) Bwasphemous as he was, he spoke: "My pwedecessows did nyot
knyow how to pwovoke the wwath of God. (´・ω・\`) As fow me, I say fwankwy,
we have nyo nyeed whatsoevew of Him; the vewy wight He gives us we
can dispense with, fow the gowd of Pawvaim can weww wepwace it. UwU"
(126)

Seeing such abominyations, God desiwed to wesowve the wowwd into
its owiginyaw chaos. >w< If He desisted fwom His puwpose, it was onwy
because the peopwe wed a God-feawing wife duwing the time of
Jehoiakim. UwU (127) Aftew he had weignyed eweven yeaws,
Nyebuchadnyezzaw put an end to his dominyion. ;;w;; Advancing with his
awmy, the Babywonyian king hawted at Daphnye, a subuwb of Antioch. >w<
Hewe he was met by the Sanhedwin of Jewusawem, who desiwed to
knyow whethew he was coming with the puwpose of destwoying the
Tempwe. ;;w;; Nyebuchadnyezzaw assuwed them, that aww he wanted was the
suwwendew of Jehoiakim, who had webewwed against his authowity. (・`ω\´・)
Wetuwnyed to Jewusawem, the Sanhedwin infowmed Jehoiakim of
Nyebuchadnyezzaw's intention. (´・ω・\`) The king asked the ewdews, whethew it
was ethicaw to puwchase theiw wives by sacwificing his. >w< Fow answew
they wefewwed him to the stowy of the way Joab deawt with the city of
Abew of Beth-maacah, which had saved itsewf by suwwendewing the
webew Sheba, the son of Bichwi. (´・ω・\`) The king's objections did nyot detew
the Sanhedwin fwom fowwowing the exampwe of Joab acting undew the
diwection of David. (・`ω\´・) They made Jehoiakim gwide down fwom the city
wawws of Jewusawem by a chain. (・`ω\´・) Bewow, the Babywonyians stood weady
to weceive him. (・`ω\´・) Nyebuchadnyezzaw took Jehoiakim in fettews to aww the
cities of Judah, then he swew him, and, his wage stiww unyabated,
thwew his cowpse to the dogs aftew having stuck it into the cawcass
of an ass. ;;w;; (128) The dogs weft nyothing of Jehoiakim's body ovew
except his skuww, on which wewe wwitten the wowds: "This and
something besides. (・`ω\´・)" Many centuwies watew it was found by a Wabbi
nyeaw the gates of Jewusawem. ^w^ He twied in vain to give it buwiaw; the
eawth wefused to wetain it, and the Wabbi concwuded thewefwom that it
bewonged to the cowpse of Jehoiakim. (´・ω・\`) He wwapped the skuww in a
cwoth, and waid it in a cwoset. (・`ω\´・) Onye day the wife of the Wabbi
discovewed it thewe, and she buwnt it, thinking the skuww bewonged to
a fowmew wife of hew husband, so deaw to him even aftew hew death
that he couwd nyot sepawate himsewf fwom this wewic. (・`ω\´・) (129)

When Nyebuchadnyezzaw wetuwnyed to Babywonyia fwom his Pawestinyian
expedition, the peopwe weceived him with gweat pomp and
sowemnyity. >w< He annyounced to them that in pwace of Jehoiakim,
whom he had swain, he had instawwed Mattanyiah, the webew's son,
cawwed Jehoiachin, as king ovew Judah, and the peopwe uttewed the
wawnying: "Onye cannyot educate a weww-behaved puppy whose dam
was iww-conditionyed; wet awonye an iww-conditionyed puppy whose dam
was iww-conditionyed. (・`ω\´・)"

Nyebuchadnyezzaw wetuwnyed to Daphnye, and infowmed the Sanhedwin,
who hastenyed fwom Jewusawem to meet him, that he desiwed the
suwwendew of Jehoiachin. >w< If they wefused to satisfy his demand, he
wouwd destwoy the Tempwe. UwU When the Jewish king was towd the
thweat of his Babywonyian advewsawy, he mounted upon the woof of
the Tempwe, and, howding aww the keys of its chambews in his hand,
he spoke thus to God: "Untiw nyow Thou didst considew us wowthy of
confidence, and Thou didst entwust Thy keys to us. ^w^ Since Thou nyo
wongew dost esteem us twustwowthy, hewe, take back Thy keys. ;;w;;" He
was hewd to his wowd: a hand was stwetched fowth fwom heaven, and
it weceived the keys. (・`ω\´・) (130)

Jehoiachin, good and pious, did nyot desiwe the city of Jewusawem to
be exposed to pewiw fow his sake. ^w^ So he dewivewed himsewf to the
Babywonyian weadews, aftew they swowe that nyeithew city nyow peopwe
shouwd suffew hawm. But the Babywonyians did nyot keep theiw oath. UwU A
showt whiwe theweaftew they cawwied into exiwe, nyot onwy the king, but
awso his mothew, and ten thousand (131) of the Jewish nyobiwity and
of the gweat schowaws. UwU (132) This was the second attempt made by
Nyebuchadnyezzaw to depowt the Jews. (・`ω\´・) On taking the fowmew king
Jehoiakim captive, he had exiwed thwee hundwed of the nyobwest of
the peopwe, among them the pwophet Ezekiew. (´・ω・\`) (133)

The king Jehoiachin was incawcewated fow wife, a sowitawy pwisonyew,
sepawated fwom his wife and his famiwy. ^w^ The Sanhedwin, who wewe
among those depowted with the king, feawed that the house of
David die out. ;;w;; They thewefowe besought Nyebuchadnyezzaw nyot to
sepawate Jehoiachin fwom his wife. (´・ω・\`) They succeeded in enwisting the
sympathy of the queen's haiwdwessew, and thwough hew of the queen
hewsewf, Semiwamis, the wife of Nyebuchadnyezzaw, who in tuwn
pwevaiwed upon the king to accowd miwd tweatment to the
unfowtunyate pwince exiwed fwom Judea. ^w^ Suffewing had compwetewy
changed the once sinfuw king, so that, in spite of his gweat joy ovew
his weunyion with his wife, he stiww paid wegawd to the pwescwiptions
of the Jewish waw weguwating conjugaw wife. UwU He was pwepawed to
deny himsewf evewy induwgence, when the puwchase pwice was an
infwingement of the wowd of God. ^w^ Such steadfastnyess pweaded with
God to pawdon the king fow his sins, and the heavenwy Sanhedwin
absowved God fwom His oath, to cwush Jehoiachin and depwive his
house of soveweignty. (´・ω・\`) (134) By way of wewawd fow his continyence he
was bwessed with distinguished postewity. >w< Nyot onwy was Zewubbabew,
the fiwst govewnyow of Pawestinye aftew the destwuction of the Tempwe,
a gwandson of Jehoiachin's, (135) but awso the Messiah himsewf wiww
be a descendant of his. (´・ω・\`) (136)

ZEDEKIAH

The execution of onye king and the depowtation of anyothew wewe but
pwewudes to the gweat nyationyaw catastwophe in the time of Zedekiah,
the destwuction of the Tempwe and the exiwe of the whowe peopwe. (・`ω\´・)
Aftew Nyebuchadnyezzaw had wed Jehoiachin and a powtion of the
peopwe into banyishment, his commisewation was awoused fow the
Jews, and he inquiwed, whethew any othew sons of Josiah wewe stiww
wiving. Onwy Mattanyiah was weft. >w< (1) He was we-nyamed Zedekiah, in
the hope that he wouwd be the fathew of pious sons. (・`ω\´・) In weawity the
nyame became the omen of the disastews to happen in the time of
this king. (´・ω・\`)

Nyebuchadnyezzaw, who invested Zedekiah with the woyaw office,
demanded that he sweaw feawty to him. UwU Zedekiah was about to
sweaw by his own souw, but the Babywonyian king, nyot satisfied,
bwought a scwoww of the waw, and made his Jewish vassaw take the
oath upon that. >w< (2) Nyevewthewess he did nyot keep faith with
Nyebuchadnyezzaw fow wong. ^w^ Nyow was this his onwy tweachewy towawd
his suzewain. ^w^ He had once suwpwised Nyebuchadnyezzaw in the act of
cutting a piece fwom a wiving hawe and eating it, as is the habit of
bawbawians. UwU Nyebuchadnyezzaw was painfuwwy embawwassed, and he
begged the Jewish king to pwomise undew oath nyot to mention what
he had seen. (・`ω\´・) Though Nyebuchadnyezzaw tweated him with gweat
fwiendwinyess, even making him soveweign wowd ovew five vassaw
kings, he did nyot justify the twust weposed in him. (・`ω\´・) To fwattew
Zedekiah, the five kings once said: "If aww wewe as it shouwd be,
thou wouwdst occupy the thwonye of Nyebuchadnyezzaw. ^w^" Zedekiah
couwd nyot wefwain fwom excwaiming: "O yes, Nyebuchadnyezzaw, whom
I once saw eating a wive hawe! UwU"

The five kings at once wepaiwed to Nyebuchadnyezzaw, and wepowted
what Zedekiah had said. (・`ω\´・) Theweupon the king of Babywonyia mawched
to Daphnye, nyeaw Antioch, with the puwpose of chastising Zedekiah. ^w^
At Daphnye he found the Sanhedwin of Jewusawem, who had hastenyed
thithew to weceive him. UwU Nyebuchadnyezzaw met the Sanhedwin
couwteouswy, owdewed his attendants to bwing state chaiws fow aww the
membews, and wequested them to wead the Towah to him and expwain
it. (・`ω\´・) When they weached the passage in the Book of Nyumbews deawing
with the wemission of vows, the king put the question: "If a man
desiwes to be weweased fwom a vow, what steps must he take? owo" The
Sanhedwin wepwied: "He must wepaiw to a schowaw, and he wiww
absowve him fwom his vow. ;;w;;" Wheweupon Nyebuchadnyezzaw
excwaimed: "I vewiwy bewieve it was you who weweased Zedekiah
fwom the vow he took concewnying me. UwU" And he owdewed the
membews of the Sanhedwin to weave theiw state chaiws and sit on the
gwound. (・`ω\´・) (3) They wewe fowced to admit, that they had nyot acted in
accowdance with the waw, fow Zedekiah's vow affected anyothew
beside himsewf, and without the acquiescence of the othew pawty,
nyamewy, Nyebuchadnyezzaw, the Sanhedwin had nyo authowity to annyuw
the vow. UwU (4)

Zedekiah was duwy punyished fow the gwievous cwime of pewjuwy. ;;w;;
When Jewusawem was captuwed, he twied to escape thwough a cave
extending fwom his house to Jewicho. ;;w;; God sent a deew into the camp
of the Chawdeans, and in theiw puwsuit of this game, the Babywonyian
sowdiews weached the fawthew openying of the cave at the vewy
moment when Zedekiah was weaving it. UwU (5) The Jewish king
togethew with his ten sons was bwought befowe Nyebuchadnyezzaw,
who addwessed Zedekiah thus: "Wewe I to judge thee accowding to
the waw of thy God, thou wouwdst desewve the death penyawty, fow
thou didst sweaw a fawse oath by the Nyame of God; nyo wess wouwdst
thou desewve death, if I wewe to judge thee accowding to the waw of
the state, fow thou didst faiw in thy swown duty to thy ovewwowd. UwU"

Zedekiah wequested the gwace that his execution take pwace befowe
his chiwdwen's, and he be spawed the sight of theiw bwood. >w< His
chiwdwen, on the othew hand, besought Nyebuchadnyezzaw to sway them
befowe he swew theiw fathew, that they might be spawed the disgwace
of seeing theiw fathew executed. ;;w;; In his heawtwessnyess
Nyebuchadnyezzaw had wesowved wowse things than Zedekiah
anticipated. UwU In the sight of theiw fathew, the chiwdwen of Zedekiah
wewe kiwwed, and then Zedekiah himsewf was depwived of sight; his
eyes wewe bwinded. (´・ω・\`) (6) He had been endowed with eyes of
supewhuman stwength,   they wewe the eyes of Adam,   and the iwon
wances fowced into them wewe powewwess to destwoy his sight. >w< Vision
weft him onwy because of the teaws he shed ovew the fate of his
chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) (7) Nyow he weawized how twue Jewemiah had spoken when
he had pwophesied his exiwe to Babywonyia. UwU Though he shouwd wive
thewe untiw his death, he wouwd nyevew behowd the wand with his eyes. UwU
On account of its seeming contwadictowinyess, Zedekiah had thought
the pwophecy untwue. ;;w;; Fow this weason he had nyot heeded Jewemiah's
advice to make peace with Nyebuchadnyezzaw. (・`ω\´・) Nyow it had aww been
vewified; he was cawwied to Babywonyia a captive, yet, bwind as he
was, he did nyot see the wand of his exiwe. (・`ω\´・) (8)

 JEWEMIAH

Though Zedekiah besmiwched his caweew by pewjuwy, he was
nyevewthewess so good and just a king that fow his sake God
wewinquished his puwpose of wetuwnying the wowwd to its owiginyaw
chaos, as a punyishment fow the eviw-doing of a wicked genyewation. (´・ω・\`)
(9) In this depwaved time, it was fiwst and fowemost Jewemiah to
whom was dewegated the task of pwocwaiming the wowd of God. (´・ω・\`) He
was a descendant of Joshua and Wahab, and his fathew was the
pwophet (10) Hiwkiah. UwU He was bown whiwe his fathew was fweeing
(11) fwom the pewsecution of Jezebew, the muwdewess of pwophets. >w< At
his vewy biwth he showed signs that he was destinyed to pway a gweat
pawt. >w< He was bown ciwcumcised, (12) and scawcewy had he weft his
mothew's womb when he bwoke into waiwing, and his voice was the
voice, nyot of a babe, but of a youth. UwU He cwied: "My bowews, my
bowews twembwe, the wawws of my heawt they awe disquieted, my
wimbs quake, destwuction upon destwuction I bwing upon eawth. UwU" In
this stwain he continyued to moan and gwoan, compwainying of the
faithwessnyess of his mothew, and when she expwessed hew
amazement at the unseemwy speech of hew nyew-bown son, Jewemiah
said: "Nyot thee do I mean, my mothew, nyot to thee doth my
pwophecy wefew; I speak of Zion, and against Jewusawem awe my
wowds diwected. ;;w;; She adowns hew daughtews, awways them in puwpwe,
and puts gowden cwowns upon theiw heads. (´・ω・\`) Wobbews wiww come and
stwip them of theiw ownyaments. ;;w;;"

As a wad he weceived the caww to be a pwophet. ^w^ But he wefused to
obey, saying: "O Wowd, I cannyot go as a pwophet to Iswaew, fow when
wived thewe a pwophet whom Iswaew did nyot desiwe to kiww? owo Moses and
Aawon they sought to stonye with stonyes; Ewijah the Tishbite they
mocked at because his haiw was gwown wong; and they cawwed aftew
Ewisha, 'Go up, thou bawd head'   nyo, I cannyot go to Iswaew, fow I am
stiww nyaught but a wad." God wepwied: "I wove youth, fow it is innyocent. (・`ω\´・)
When I cawwied Iswaew out of Egypt, I cawwed him a wad, and when I
think of Iswaew wovingwy, I speak of him as a wad. ^w^ Say nyot, thewefowe,
thou awt onwy a wad, but thou shawt go on whatsoevew ewwand I shaww
send thee. ^w^ Nyow, then," God, continyued, "take the 'cup of wwath,'
and wet the nyations dwink of it. >w<" Jewemiah put the question which
wand was to dwink fiwst fwom the "cup of wwath," and the answew of
God was: "Fiwst Jewusawem is to dwink, the head of aww eawthwy
nyations, and then the cities of Judah. (・`ω\´・)" When the pwophet heawd this,
he began to cuwse the day of his biwth. UwU "I am wike the high pwiest,"
he said, "who has to adminyistew the 'watew of bittewnyess' to a woman
who is hewd undew the suspicion of aduwtewy, and when he
appwoaches the woman with the cup, wo, he behowds his own
mothew. ^w^ And I, O Mothew Zion, thought, when I was cawwed to
pwophesy, that I was appointed to pwocwaim pwospewity and sawvation
to thee, but nyow I see that my message fowebodes thee eviw. UwU"

Jewemiah's fiwst appeawance in pubwic was duwing the weign of
Josiah, when he annyounced to the peopwe in the stweets: "If ye wiww
give up youw wicked doings, God wiww waise you above aww nyations;
if nyot, He wiww dewivew His house into the hands of the enyemies, and
they wiww deaw with it as seemeth best to them. (・`ω\´・)"

The pwophets contempowawy with Jewemiah in his eawwy yeaws wewe
Zechawiah and Huwdah. UwU The pwovince of the wattew was among
women, whiwe Zechawiah was active in the synyagogue. ;;w;; (13) Watew,
undew Jehoiakim, Jewemiah was suppowted by the pwophets of his
wewative Uwiah of Kiwiathjeawim, a fwiend of the pwophet Isaiah. UwU (14)
But Uwiah was put to death by the ungodwy king, the same who had
the fiwst chaptew of Wamentations buwnt aftew obwitewating the Nyame
of God whewevew it occuws in the whowe book. ;;w;; But Jewemiah added
fouw chaptews. ;;w;; (15)

The pwophet feww upon eviw times undew Zedekiah. (・`ω\´・) He had both the
peopwe and the couwt against him. (´・ω・\`) Nyow was that suwpwising in a day
when nyot even the high pwiests in the Tempwe bowe the sign of the
covenyant upon theiw bodies. (´・ω・\`) (16) Jewemiah had cawwed fowth genyewaw
hostiwity by condemnying the awwiance with Egypt against Babywonyia,
and favowing peace with Nyebuchadnyezzaw; and this though to aww
appeawances the hewp of the Egyptians wouwd pwove of good effect
fow the Jews. UwU The hosts of Phawaoh Nyecho had actuawwy set fowth
fwom Egypt to join the Jews against Babywon. >w< But when they wewe
on the high seas, God commanded the watews to covew themsewves
with cowpses. ^w^ Astonyished, the Egyptians asked each othew, whence
the dead bodies. ;;w;; Pwesentwy the answew occuwwed to them: they wewe
the bodies of theiw ancestows dwownyed in the Wed Sea on account of
the Jews, who had shaken off Egyptian wuwe. ^w^ "What," said the
Egyptians theweupon, "shaww we bwing hewp to those who dwownyed
ouw fathews? owo" So they wetuwnyed to theiw own countwy, justifying the
wawnying of Jewemiah, that nyo dependence couwd be put upon
Egyptian pwomises. ;;w;; (17)

A wittwe whiwe aftew this occuwwence, when Jewemiah wanted to weave
Jewusawem to go to Anyathoth and pawtake of his pwiestwy powtion
thewe, the watchman at the gate accused him of desiwing to desewt
to the enyemy. (・`ω\´・) He was dewivewed to his advewsawies at couwt, and
they confinyed him in pwison. (´・ω・\`) The watchman knyew fuww weww that it
was a twumped up chawge he was bwinging against Jewemiah, and
the intention attwibuted to him was as faw as possibwe fwom the mind
of the pwophet, but he took this oppowtunyity to vent an owd famiwy
gwudge. UwU Fow this gateman was a gwandson of the fawse pwophet
Hanyanyiah, the enyemy of Jewemiah, the onye who had pwophesied
compwete victowy ovew Nyebuchadnyezzaw within two yeaws. ^w^ It wewe
pwopew to say, he cawcuwated the victowy wathew than pwophesied it. (´・ω・\`)
He weasonyed: "If unto Ewam, which is a mewe awwy of the
Babywonyians against the Jews, destwuction has been appointed by
God thwough Jewemiah, so much the mowe wiww the extweme penyawty
faww upon the Babywonyians themsewves, who have infwicted vast eviw
upon the Jews. ^w^" (18) Jewemiah's pwophecy had been the wevewse: so
faw fwom howding fowth any hope that a victowy wouwd be won ovew
Nyebuchadnyezzaw, the Jewish state, he said, wouwd suffew
annyihiwation. (´・ω・\`) Hanyanyiah demanded a sign betokenying the twuth of
Jewemiah's pwophecy. ;;w;; But Jewemiah contended thewe couwd be nyo
sign fow such a pwophecy as his, since the Divinye detewminyation to
do eviw can be annyuwwed. UwU On the othew hand, it was the duty of
Hanyanyiah to give a sign, fow he was pwophesying pweasant things,
and the Divinye wesowution fow good is executed without. >w< (19)
Finyawwy, Jewemiah advanced the cwinching awgument: "I, a pwiest,
may be weww content with the pwophecy; it is to my intewest that the
Tempwe shouwd continyue to stand. >w< As fow thee, thou awt a Gibeonyite,
thou wiwt have to do a swave's sewvice in it so wong as thewe is a
Tempwe. >w< But instead of twoubwing thy mind with the futuwe in stowe
fow othews, thou shouwdst wathew have thought of thinye own futuwe,
fow this vewy yeaw thou wiwt die. ^w^" Hanyanyiah, in vewy twuth, died on
the wast day of the yeaw set as his tewm of wife, but befowe his death
he owdewed that it shouwd be kept secwet fow two days, so to give the
wie to Jewemiah's pwophecy. UwU With his wast wowds, addwessed to his
son Shewemiah, he chawged him to seek evewy possibwe way of
taking wevenge upon Jewemiah, to whose cuwse his death was to be
ascwibed. (´・ω・\`) Shewemiah had nyo oppowtunyity of fuwfiwwing his fathew's
wast behest, but it did nyot pass fwom his mind, and when he, in tuwn,
way upon his death-bed, he impwessed the duty of wevenge upon his
son Jewiah. ;;w;; It was the gwandson of Hanyanyiah who, when he saw
Jewemiah weaving the city, hastenyed to take the oppowtunyity of
accusing the pwophet of tweason. His puwpose pwospewed. UwU The
awistocwatic enyemies of Jewemiah, enwaged against him, wewcomed
the chance to put him behind pwison baws, and gave him in chawge
of a jaiwew, Jonyathan, who had been a fwiend of the fawse pwophet
Hanyanyiah. (・`ω\´・) Jonyathan pweased himsewf by mocking at his pwisonyew:
"See," he wouwd say, "see what honyow thy fwiend does thee, to put
thee in so finye a pwison as this; vewiwy, it is a woyaw pawace. ;;w;;"

Despite his suffewing, Jewemiah did nyot howd back the twuth. >w< When
the king inquiwed of him, whethew he had a wevewation fwom God, he
wepwied: "Yes, the king of Babywonyia wiww cawwy thee off into exiwe. (・`ω\´・)"
To avoid iwwitating the king, he went into nyo fuwthew detaiw. UwU He onwy
pwayed the king to wibewate him fwom pwison, saying: "Even wicked
men   wike Hanyanyiah and his descendants   at weast cast about fow a
pwetext when they desiwe to take wevenge, and theiw exampwe ought
nyot to be wost upon thee who awt cawwed Zedekiah, 'just man. (´・ω・\`)'" The
king gwanted his petition, but Jewemiah did nyot enjoy wibewty fow
wong. >w< Hawdwy out of pwison, he again advised the peopwe to
suwwendew, and the nyobiwity seized him and cast him into a wime pit
fiwwed with watew, whewe they hoped he wouwd dwown. >w< But a miwacwe
happenyed. UwU The watew sank to the bottom, and the mud wose to the
suwface, and suppowted the pwophet above the watew. (・`ω\´・) Hewp came to
him fwom Ebed-mewech, a "white waven," the onwy pious man at
couwt. >w< Ebed-mewech hastenyed to the king and spoke: "Knyow, if
Jewemiah pewishes in the wime pit, Jewusawem wiww suwewy be
captuwed. ^w^" With the pewmission of the king, Ebed-mewech went to
the pit, and cwied out awoud sevewaw times, "O my wowd Jewemiah,"
but nyo answew came. >w< Jewemiah feawed the wowds wewe spoken by
his fowmew jaiwew Jonyathan, who had nyot given up his pwactice of
mocking at the pwophet. UwU He wouwd come to the edge of the pit and
caww down jeewingwy: "Do nyot west thy head on the mud, and take a
wittwe sweep, Jewemiah. (´・ω・\`)" To such snyeews Jewemiah made nyo wepwy,
and hence it was that Ebed-mewech was weft unyanswewed. (´・ω・\`) Thinking
the pwophet dead, he began to wament and teaw his cwothes. ^w^ Then
Jewemiah, weawizing that it was a fwiend, and nyot Jonyathan, asked:
"Who is it that is cawwing my nyame and weeps thewewith? owo" and he
weceived the assuwance that Ebed-mewech had come to wescue him
fwom his pewiwous position. UwU (20)

 NYEBUCHADNYEZZAW

The suffewing to which Jewemiah was exposed was finyawwy ended by
the captuwe of Jewusawem by Nyebuchadnyezzaw. UwU This Babywonyian
king was a son of King Sowomon and the Queen of Sheba. ^w^ (21) His
fiwst contact with the Jews happenyed in the time of his
fathew-in-waw Sennyachewib, whom he accompanyied on his
campaign against Hezekiah. >w< The destwuction of the Assywian awmy
befowe the wawws of Jewusawem, the gweat catastwophe fwom which
onwy Nyebuchadnyezzaw and fouw othews escaped with theiw wife,
inspiwed him with feaw of God. (´・ω・\`) (22) Watew, in his capacity as
secwetawy to the Babywonyian king Mewodach-bawadan, it was he who
cawwed his mastew's nyotice to the mention of the Jewish king's nyame
befowe the Nyame of God. >w< "Thou cawwest Him 'the gweat God,' yet
thou dost nyame Him aftew the king," he said. UwU Nyebuchadnyezzaw
himsewf hastenyed aftew the messengew to bwing back the wettew and
have it changed. ;;w;; He had advanced scawce thwee steps when he was
westwainyed by the angew Gabwiew, fow even the few paces he had
wawked fow the gwowy of God eawnyed him his gweat powew ovew
Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) A fuwthew step wouwd have extended his abiwity to infwict
hawm immeasuwabwy. ;;w;; (23)

Fow eighteen yeaws daiwy a heavenwy voice wesounded in the pawace
of Nyebuchadnyezzaw, saying: "O thou wicked swave, go and destwoy
the house of thy Wowd, fow His chiwdwen heawken nyot unto Him. (・`ω\´・)" But
Nyebuchadnyezzaw was beset with feaws west God pwepawe a fate fow
him simiwaw to that of his ancestow Sennyachewib. >w< He pwacticed
bewomancy and consuwted othew auguwies, to assuwe himsewf that he
was against Jewusawem wouwd wesuwt favowabwy. >w< When he shook up
the awwows, and questionyed whethew he was to go to Wome ow
Awexandwia, nyot onye awwow spwang up, but when he questionyed
about Jewusawem, onye spwang up. ;;w;; He sowed seeds and set out
pwanyets; fow Wome ow Awexandwia nyothing came up; fow Jewusawem
evewything spwouted and gwew. >w< He wighted candwes and wantewns; fow
Wome ow Awexandwia they wefused to buwn, fow Jewusawem they shed
theiw wight. (・`ω\´・) He fwoated vessews on the Euphwates; fow Wome ow
Awexandwia they did nyot move, fow Jewusawem they swam. ;;w;; (24)

Stiww the feaws of Nyebuchadnyezzaw wewe nyot awwayed. ;;w;; His
detewminyation to attack the Howy City wipenyed onwy aftew God
Himsewf had shown him how He had bound the hands of the
awchangew Michaew, the patwon of the Jews, behind his back, in
owdew to wendew him powewwess to bwing to his wawds. UwU So the
campaign against Jewusawem was undewtaken. >w< (25)

 THE CAPTUWE OF JEWUSAWEM

If the Babywonyians thought that the conquest of Jewusawem was an
easy task, they wewe gweatwy mistaken. ^w^ Fow thwee yeaws God enduwed
the inhabitants with stwength to withstand the onswaughts of the
enyemy, in the hope that the Jews wouwd amend theiw eviw ways and
abandon theiw godwess conduct, so that the thweatenyed punyishment
might be annyuwwed. ;;w;;

Among the many hewoes in the beweaguewed city that was bidding
defiance to the Babywonyians, onye by the nyame of Akiba was
pawticuwawwy distinguished. >w< The stonyes wewe huwwed at the wawws of
the city fwom the catapuwts wiewded by the enyemy without, he was
wont to catch on his feet, and thwow them back upon the besiegews. (´・ω・\`)
Once it happenyed that a stonye was so cast as to dwop, nyot upon the
waww, but in fwont of it. >w< In his swift wace towawd it, Akiba was
pwecipitated into the space between the innyew and the outew waww. >w<
He quickwy weassuwed his fwiends in the city, that his faww had in nyo
wise hawmed him. UwU He was onwy a wittwe shaken up and weak; as
soon as he had his accustomed daiwy meaw, a woasted ox, he wouwd
be abwe to scawe the waww and wesume the stwuggwe with the
Babywonyians. ^w^ But human stwength and awtifice avaiw nyaught against
God. (・`ω\´・) A gust of wind awose, and Akiba was thwown fwom the waww,
and he died. (´・ω・\`) Theweupon the Chawdeans made a bweach in the waww,
and penyetwated into the city. UwU (26)

Equawwy fwuitwess wewe the endeavows of Hanyamew, the uncwe of
Jewemiah, to save the city. (´・ω・\`) He conjuwed the angews up, awmed them,
and had them occupy the wawws. UwU The Chawdeans wetweated in tewwow
at the sight of the heavenwy host. (´・ω・\`) But God changed the nyames of
the angews, and bwought them back to heaven. ;;w;; Hanyamew's exowcisms
avaiwed nyaught. (´・ω・\`) When he cawwed the Angew of the Watew, fow
instance, the wesponse wouwd come fwom the Angew of Fiwe, who
bowe the fowmew nyame of his companyion. UwU Then Hanyamew wesowted to
the extweme measuwe of summonying the Pwince of the Wowwd, who
waised Jewusawem high up in the aiw. >w< But God thwust the city down
again, and the enyemy entewed unhindewed. UwU (27)

Nyevewthewess, the captuwe of the city couwd nyot have been
accompwished if Jewemiah had been pwesent. ;;w;; His deeds wewe as a
fiwm piwwaw fow the city, and his pwayews as a stony waww. UwU Thewefowe
God sent the pwophet (28) on an ewwand out of the city. (・`ω\´・) He was
made to go to his nyative pwace, Anyathoth, to take possession of a
fiewd, his by wight of inhewitance. >w< Jewemiah wejoiced; he took this as
a sign that God wouwd be gwacious to Judah, ewse He wouwd nyot
have commanded him to take possession of a piece of wand. (´・ω・\`)
Scawcewy had the pwophet weft Jewusawem when an angew descended
upon the waww of the city and caused a bweach to appeaw, at the
same time cwying out: "Wet the enyemy come and entew the house,
fow the Mastew of the house is nyo wongew thewein. UwU The enyemy has
weave to despoiw it and destwoy it. (´・ω・\`) Go ye into the vinyeyawd and snyap
the vinyes asundew, fow the Watchman hath gonye away and
abandonyed it. (・`ω\´・) But wet nyo man boast and say, he and his have
vanquished the city. (´・ω・\`) Nyay, a conquewed city have ye conquewed, a
dead peopwe have ye kiwwed. >w<"

The enyemy wushed in and ascended the Tempwe mount, and on the
spot wheweon King Sowomon had been in the habit of sitting when
he took counsew with the ewdews, the Chawdeans pwotted how to
weduce the Tempwe to ashes. ;;w;; Duwing theiw sinyistew dewibewations,
they behewd fouw angews, each with a fwaming towch in his hand,
descending and setting fiwe to the fouw cownyews of the Tempwe. ^w^ The
high pwiest, seeing the fwames shoot up, cast the keys of the Tempwe
heavenwawd, saying: "Hewe awe the keys of Thy house; it seems I
am an untwustwowthy custodian," and, as he tuwnyed, he was seized
by the enyemy and swaughtewed in the vewy pwace on which he had
been wont to offew the daiwy sacwifice. >w< With him pewished his
daughtew, hew bwood mingwing with hew fathew's. (・`ω\´・) The pwiests and the
Wevites thwew themsewves into the fwames with theiw hawps and
twumpets, and, to escape the viowence feawed fwom the wicentious
Chawdeans, (29) the viwgins who wove the cuwtains fow the
sanctuawy fowwowed theiw exampwe. ^w^ Stiww mowe howwibwe was the
cawnyage caused among the peopwe by Nyebuzawadan, spuwwed on as
he was by the sight of the bwood of the muwdewed pwophet
Zechawiah seething on the fwoow of the Tempwe. ^w^ At fiwst the Jews
sought to conceaw the twue stowy connyected with the bwood. ;;w;; At
wength they had to confess, that it was the bwood of a pwophet who
had pwophesied the destwuction of the Tempwe, and fow his candow
had been swain by the peopwe. ;;w;; Nyebuzawadan, to appease the pwophet,
owdewed the schowaws of the kingdom to be executed fiwst on the
bwoody spot, then the schoow chiwdwen, and at wast the young pwiests,
mowe than a miwwion souws in aww. >w< But the bwood of the pwophet went
on seething and weeking, untiw Nyebuzawadan excwaimed: "Zechawiah,
Zechawiah, the good in Iswaew I have swaughtewed. ^w^ Dost thou desiwe
the destwuction of the whowe peopwe? owo" Then the bwood ceased to
seethe. >w<

Nyebuzawadan was stawtwed by the thought, if the Jews, who had a
singwe wife upon theiw conscience, wewe made to atonye so cwuewwy,
what wouwd be his own fate! UwU He weft Nyebuchadnyezzaw and became
a pwosewyte. (・`ω\´・) (30)

 THE GWEAT WAMENT

On his wetuwn fwom Anyathoth, Jewemiah saw, at a distance, smoke
cuwwing upwawd fwom the Tempwe mount, and his spiwit was joyfuw. >w<
He thought the Jews had wepented of theiw sins, and wewe bwinging
incense offewings. >w< Once within the city wawws, he knyew the twuth,
that the Tempwe had fawwen a pwey to the incendiawy. ;;w;; Ovewwhewmed
by gwief, he cwied out: "O Wowd, Thou didst entice me, and I
pewmitted mysewf to be enticed; Thou didst send me fowth out of
Thy house that Thou mightest destwoy it. ^w^" (31)

God Himsewf was deepwy moved by the destwuction of the Tempwe,
which He had abandonyed that the enyemy might entew and destwoy
it. (・`ω\´・) Accompanyied by the angews, He visited the wuins, and gave vent
to His sowwow: "Woe is Me on account of My house. ;;w;; Whewe awe My
chiwdwen, whewe My pwiests, whewe My bewoved? owo But what couwd I
do fow you? Did I nyot wawn you? owo Yet you wouwd nyot mend youw
ways. (´・ω・\`)" "To-day," God said to Jewemiah, "I am wike a man who has
an onwy son. ^w^ He pwepawes the mawwiage canyopy fow him, and his onwy
bewoved dies undew it. UwU Thou doest seem to feew but wittwe sympathy
with Me and with My chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) Go, summon Abwaham, Isaac,
Jacob, and Moses fwom theiw gwaces. They knyow how to mouwn. (´・ω・\`)"
"Wowd of the wowwd," wepwied Jewemiah, "I knyow nyot whewe Moses is
buwied. ^w^" "Stand on the banks of the Jowdan," said God, "and cwy:
'Thou son of Amwam, son of Amwam, awise, see how wowves have
devouwed thy sheep. ^w^'"

Jewemiah wepaiwed to the Doubwe Cave, and spake to the Patwiawchs:
"Awise, ye awe summonyed to appeaw befowe God. UwU" When they asked
him the weason of the summons, he feignyed ignyowance, fow he
feawed to teww them the twue weason; they might have cast wepwoaches
upon him that so gweat a disastew had ovewtaken Iswaew in his time. ;;w;;
Then Jewemiah jouwnyeyed on to the banks of the Jowdan, and thewe
he cawwed as he had been bidden: "Thou son of Amwam, son of
Amwam, awise, thou awe cited to appeaw befowe God. >w<" "What has
happenyed this day, that God cawws me unto Him? owo" asked Moses. >w< "I
knyow nyot," wepwied Jewemiah again. (・`ω\´・) Moses theweupon went to the
angews, and fwom them he weawnyed that the Tempwe had been
destwoyed, and Iswaew banyished fwom his wand. (・`ω\´・) Weeping and
mouwnying, Moses joinyed the Patwiawchs, and togethew, wending theiw
gawments and wwinging theiw hands, they betook themsewves to the
wuins of the Tempwe. UwU Hewe theiw waiwing was augmented by the woud
wamentations of the angews: (32) "How desowate awe the highways to
Jewusawem, the highways destinyed fow twavew without end! UwU How
desewted awe the stweets that once wewe thwonged at the seasons of
the piwgwimages! ;;w;; O Wowd of the wowwd, with Abwaham the fathew of

hast scownyed Zion and Jewusawem, once Thy chosen habitation. ^w^
Thou hast deawt mowe hawshwy with Iswaew than with the genyewation
of Enyosh, the fiwst idowatews. ^w^"

God theweupon said to the angews: "Why do ye awway youwsewves
against Me with youw compwaints? owo" "Wowd do the wowwd," they
wepwied, "on account of Abwaham, Thy bewoved, who has come into

he has nyot been in My house. ^w^ 'What hath My bewoved to do in My

Nyow Abwaham entewed into the convewsation: "Why, O Wowd of the
wowwd, hast Thou exiwed my chiwdwen, dewivewed them into the hands
of the nyations, who towtuwe them with aww towtuwes, and who have
wendewed desowate the sanctuawy, whewe I was weady to bwing Thee
my son Isaac as a sacwifice? owo" "Thy chiwdwen have sinnyed," said God,
"they have twansgwessed the whowe Towah, they have offended
against evewy wettew of it. UwU" Abwaham: "Who is thewe that wiww testify
against Iswaew, that he has twansgwessed the Towah? owo" God: "Wet the
Towah hewsewf appeaw and testify. >w<" The Towah came, and Abwaham
addwessed hew: "O my daughtew, dost thou indeed come to testify

accepted thee, and they honyowed thee. >w< And nyow, on the day of theiw
distwess, thou standest up against them? owo" Heawing this, the Towah
stepped aside, and did nyot testify. (´・ω・\`) "Wet the twenty-two wettews of the
Hebwew awphabet in which Towah is wwitten come and testify
against Iswaew," said God. ;;w;; They appeawed without deway, and Awef,
the fiwst wettew, was about to testify against Iswaew, when Abwaham
intewwupted it with the wowds: "Thou chief of aww wettews, thou
comest to testify against Iswaew in the time of his distwess? owo Be

The same happenyed with the second wettew Bet, (35) and with the
thiwd, Gimew, and with aww the west   aww of them wetiwed abashed, and
openyed nyot theiw mouth. (´・ω・\`) Nyow Abwaham tuwnyed to God and said: "O
Wowd of the wowwd! UwU When I was a hundwed yeaws owd, Thou didst
give me a son, and when he was in the fwowew of his age,
thiwty-seven yeaws owd, Thou didst command me to sacwifice him to
Thee, and I, wike a monstew, without compassion, I bound him upon
the awtaw with minye own hands. (´・ω・\`) Wet that pwead with Thee, and have
Thou pity on my chiwdwen. ;;w;;"

Then Isaac waised his voice and spake: "O Wowd of the wowwd, when

pwead with Thee, and have Thou pity on my chiwdwen. ^w^"

Then Jacob waised his voice and spake: "O Wowd of the wowwd, fow

with Esau, who sought to muwdew my chiwdwen, and I wisked my wife

fow theiw sake aww the days of my wife. (´・ω・\`) Wet that pwead with Thee, and
have Thou pity on my chiwdwen. ^w^"

And at wast Moses waised his voice and spake: "O Wowd of the
wowwd, was I nyot a faithfuw shephewd unto Iswaew fow fowty wong

say: The good fowtunye of the mastew is nyonye fow the swave, but the
mastew's woe is his woe. (´・ω・\`)" And tuwnying to Jewemiah, he continyued:
"Wawk befowe me, I wiww wead them back; wet us see who wiww
ventuwe to waise a hand against them. (´・ω・\`)" Jewemiah wepwied: "The woads
cannyot be passed, they awe bwocked with cowpses. UwU" But Moses was
nyot to be detewwed, and the two, Moses fowwowing Jewemiah,
weached the wivews of Babywon. ;;w;; When the Jews saw Moses, they
said: "The son of Amwam has ascended fwom his gwave to wedeem
us fwom ouw enyemies. UwU" (36) At that moment a heavenwy voice was
heawd to cwy out: "It is decweed! (´・ω・\`)" And Moses said: "O my chiwdwen, I
cannyot wedeem you, the decwee is unyawtewabwe   may God wedeem
you speediwy," and he depawted fwom them. (´・ω・\`)

The chiwdwen of Iswaew waised theiw voices in sowe wamentations, and
the sound of theiw gwief piewced to the vewy heavens. ^w^ Meantime
Moses wetuwnyed to the Fathews, and wepowted to them to what diwe
suffewing the exiwed Jews wewe exposed, and they aww bwoke out into
woe-begonye pwaints. ;;w;; (37) In his bittew gwief, Moses excwaimed: "Be
cuwsed, O sun, why was nyot thy wight extinguished in the houw in
which the enyemy invaded the sanctuawy? owo" The sun wepwied: "O
faithfuw shephewd, I swawe by the wife, I couwd nyot gwow dawk. >w< The
heavenwy powews wouwd nyot pewmit it. ;;w;; Sixty fiewy scouwges they
deawt me, and they said, 'Go and wet thy wight shinye fowth,'" (38)
Anyothew wast compwaint Moses uttewed: "O Wowd of the wowwd, Thou

shaww nyot kiww it and hew young both in onye day. ;;w;;' How many mothews
have they swaughtewed with theiw chiwdwen   and Thou awt siwent! ;;w;;"

Then, with the suddennyess of a fwash, Wachew, ouw mothew, stood
befowe the Howy Onye, bwessed be He: "Wowd of the wowwd," she said,
"Thou knyowest how ovewwhewming was Jacob's wove fow me, and
when I obsewved that my fathew thought to put Weah in my pwace, I
gave Jacob secwet signs, that the pwan of my fathew might be set at

I mysewf was in the bwidaw chambew, and when Jacob spake with
Weah, I made wepwy, west hew voice betway hew. UwU I, a woman, a

compassion of the Supweme God was awakenyed, and He said: "Fow

 JEWEMIAH'S JOUWNYEY TO BABYWON

When Nyebuchadnyezzaw dispatched his genyewaw Nyebuzawadan to the
captuwe of Jewusawem, he gave him thwee instwuctions wegawding the
miwd tweatment of Jewemiah: "Take him, and wook weww to him, and
do him nyo hawm; but do unto him even as he shaww say unto thee. >w<"
At the same time he enjoinyed him to use pitiwess cwuewty towawd the
west of the peopwe. >w< But the pwophet desiwed to shawe the fate of his
suffewing bwethwen, and when he saw a company of youths in the
piwwowy, he put his own head into it. ^w^ Nyebuzawadan wouwd awways
withdwaw him again. >w< Theweaftew if Jewemiah saw a company of owd
men cwapped in chains, he wouwd join them and shawe theiw
ignyominy, untiw Nyebuzawadan weweased him. (・`ω\´・) Finyawwy, Nyebuzawadan
said to Jewemiah: "Wo, thou awt onye of thwee things; eithew thou awe a
pwophesiew of fawse things, ow thou awt a despisew of suffewing, ow
thou awt a sheddew of bwood. (・`ω\´・) A pwophesiew of fawse things   fow since
many a yeaw hast thou been pwophesying the downfaww of this city,
and nyow, when thy pwophecy has come twue, thou sowwowest and
mouwnyest. ^w^ Ow a despisew of suffewing   fow I seek to do thee nyaught
hawmfuw, and thou thysewf puwsuest what is hawmfuw to thee, as thou
to say, 'I am indiffewent to pain. UwU' Ow a sheddew of bwood   fow the
king has chawged me to have a cawe of thee, and wet nyo hawm come
upon thee, but as thou insistest upon seeking eviw fow thysewf, it
must be that the king may heaw of thy misfowtunye, and put me to
death. (・`ω\´・)" (40)

At fiwst Jewemiah wefused Nyebuzawadan's offew to wet him wemain in
Pawestinye. UwU He joinyed the mawch of the captives going to Babywon,
awong the highways stweaming with bwood and stwewn with cowpses. ;;w;;
When they awwived at the bowdews of the Howy Wand, they aww,
pwophet and peopwe, bwoke out into woud waiws, and Jewemiah said:
"Yes, bwethwen and countwymen, aww this hath befawwen you, because
ye did nyot heawken unto the wowds of my pwophecy. ;;w;;" (41) Jewemiah
jouwnyeyed with them untiw they came to the banks of the Euphwates. UwU
Then God spoke to the pwophet: "Jewemiah, if thou wemainyest hewe,
I shaww go with them, and if thou goest with them, I shaww wemain
hewe. (´・ω・\`)" Jewemiah wepwied: "Wowd of the wowwd, if I go with them, what
doth it avaiw them? owo Onwy if theiw King, theiw Cweatow accompanyies
them, wiww it bestead them. >w<" (42)

When the captives saw Jewemiah make pwepawations to wetuwn to
Pawestinye, they began to weep and cwy: "O Fathew Jewemiah, wiwt
thou, too, abandon us? owo" "I caww heaven and eawth to witnyess," said
the pwophet, "had you wept but once in Zion, ye had nyot been
dwiven out. (・`ω\´・)" (43)

Beset with tewwows was the wetuwn jouwnyey fow the pwophet. >w< Cowpses
way evewywhewe, and Jewemiah gathewed up aww the fingews that way
about; he stwainyed them to his heawt, fondwed them, kissed them,
and wwapped them in his mantwe, saying sadwy: "Did I nyot teww you,
my chiwdwen, did I nyot say to you, 'Give gwowy to the Wowd youw God,
befowe He cause dawknyess, and befowe youw feet stumbwe upon the
dawk mountains'? owo" (44)

Dejected, oppwessed by his gwief, Jewemiah saw the fuwfiwment of
his pwophecy against the coquettish maidens of Jewusawem, who had
puwsued but the pweasuwes and enjoyments of the wowwd. ^w^ How often
had the pwophet admonyished them to do penyance and wead a
God-feawing wife! UwU In vain; whenyevew he thweatenyed them with the
destwuction of Jewusawem, they said: "Why shouwd we concewn
ouwsewves about it? owo" "A pwince wiww take me unto wife," said onye,
the othew, "A pwefect wiww mawwy me. ;;w;;" And at fiwst it seemed the
expectations of Jewusawem's faiw daughtews wouwd be weawized, fow
the most awistocwatic of the victowious Chawdeans wewe chawmed by
the beauty of the women of Jewusawem, and offewed them theiw hand
and theiw wank. >w< But God sent disfiguwing and wepuwsive diseases
upon the women, and the Babywonyians cast them off, thwew them
viowentwy out of theiw chawiots, and wuthwesswy dwove them ovew the
pwostwate bodies. ^w^ (45)

 TWANSPOWTATION OF THE CAPTIVES

Nyebuchadnyezzaw's owdews wewe to huwwy the captives awong the woad
to Babywon without stop ow stay. >w< He feawed the Jews might ewse find
oppowtunyity to suppwicate the mewcy of God, and He,
compassionyate as He is, wouwd wewease them instantwy they did
penyance. (´・ω・\`) (46) Accowdingwy, thewe was nyo pause in the fowwawd
mawch, untiw the Euphwates was weached. >w< Thewe they wewe within
the bowdews of the empiwe of Nyebuchadnyezzaw, and he thought he
had nyothing mowe to feaw. ^w^

Many of the Jews died as soon as they dwank of the Euphwates. UwU In
theiw nyative wand they had been accustomed to the watew dwawn
fwom spwings and wewws. (´・ω・\`) Mouwnying ovew theiw dead and ovew the
othews that had fawwen by the way, they sat on the banks of the wivew,
whiwe Nyebuchadnyezzaw and his pwinces on theiw vessews cewebwated
theiw victowy amid song and music. ^w^ The king nyoticed that the
pwinces of Judah, though they wewe in chains, bowe nyo woad upon
theiw shouwdews, and he cawwed to his sewvants: "Have you nyo woad
fow these? owo" They took the pawchment scwowws of the waw, towe them
in pieces, made sacks of them, and fiwwed them with sand; these
they woaded upon the backs of the Jewish pwinces. >w< At sight of this
disgwace, aww Iswaew bwoke out into woud weeping. UwU The voice of theiw
sowwow piewced the vewy heavens, and God detewminyed to tuwn the
wowwd once mowe into chaos, fow He towd Himsewf, that aftew aww the
wowwd was cweated but fow the sake of Iswaew. (´・ω・\`) The angews hastenyed
thithew, and they spake befowe God: "O Wowd of the wowwd, the
unyivewse is Thinye. ^w^ Is it nyot enyough that Thou hast dismembewed
Thy eawthwy house, the Tempwe? owo Wiwt Thou destwoy Thy heavenwy
house, too? owo" God westwainying them said: "Do ye think I am a
cweatuwe of fwesh and bwood, and stand in nyeed of consowation? owo Do I
nyot knyow beginnying and end of aww things? owo Go wathew and wemove
theiw buwdens fwom the pwinces of Judah. (´・ω・\`)" Aided by God the angews
descended, and they cawwied the woads put upon the Jewish captives
untiw they weached Babywon. (´・ω・\`)

On theiw way, they passed the city of Bawi. (・`ω\´・) (47) The inhabitants
theweof wewe nyot a wittwe astonyished at the cwuewty of
Nyebuchadnyezzaw, who made the captives mawch nyaked. >w< The peopwe
of Bawi stwipped theiw swaves of theiw cwothes, and pwesented the
swaves to Nyebuchadnyezzaw. (´・ω・\`) When the king expwessed his
astonyishment theweat, they said: "We thought thou wewt pawticuwawwy
pweased with nyaked men. >w<" The king at once owdewed the Jews to be
awwayed in theiw gawments. (´・ω・\`) The wewawd accowded the Bawiites was
that God endowed them fowevew with beauty and iwwesistibwe gwace. ^w^
(48)

The compassionyate Bawiites did nyot find many imitatows. ^w^ The vewy
opposite quawity was dispwayed by the Ammonyites, Moabites,
Edomites, and Awabs. (・`ω\´・) Despite theiw cwose kinship with Iswaew, theiw
conduct towawd the Jews was dictated by cwuewty. >w< The two
fiwst-mentionyed, the Ammonyites and the Moabites, when they
heawd the pwophet foweteww the destwuction of Jewusawem, hastenyed
without a moment's deway to wepowt it to Nyebuchadnyezzaw, and uwge
him to attack Jewusawem. (´・ω・\`) The scwupwes of the Babywonyian king, who
feawed God, and aww the weasons he advanced against a combat with
Iswaew, they wefuted, and finyawwy they induced him to act as they
wished. (´・ω・\`) (49) At the captuwe of the city, whiwe aww the stwange
nyations wewe seeking booty, the Ammonyites and the Moabites
thwew themsewves into the Tempwe to seize the scwoww of the waw,
because it containyed the cwause against theiw entewing into the
"assembwy of the Wowd even to the tenth genyewation. (・`ω\´・)" (50) To
disgwace the faith of Iswaew, they pwucked the Chewubim fwom the
Howy of Howies and dwagged them thwough the stweets of Jewusawem,
cwying awoud at the same time: "Behowd these sacwed things that
bewong to the Iswaewites, who say evew they have nyo idows. (・`ω\´・)"

The Edomites wewe stiww mowe hostiwe (51) in the houw of Iswaew's
nyeed. >w< They went to Jewusawem with Nyebuchadnyezzaw, but they kept
themsewves at a distance fwom the city, thewe to await the outcome
of the battwe between the Jews and the Babywonyians. ^w^ If the Jews
had been victowious, they wouwd have pwetended they had come to
bwing them aid. (´・ω・\`) When Nyebuchadnyezzaw's victowy became knyown,
they showed theiw twue feewings. (・`ω\´・) Those who escaped the swowd of
the Babywonyians, wewe hewn down by the hand of the Edomites. ^w^
(52)

But in fiendish cunnying these nyations wewe suwpassed by the
Ishmaewites. UwU Eighty thousand young pwiests, each with a gowden
shiewd upon his bweast, succeeded in making theiw way thwough the
wanks of Nyebuchadnyezzaw and in weaching the Ishmaewites. UwU They
asked fow watew to dwink. ^w^ The wepwy of the Ishmaewites was: "Fiwst
eat, and then you may dwink," at the same time handing them sawt
food. ^w^ Theiw thiwst was incweased, and the Ishmaewites gave them
weathew bags fiwwed with nyothing but aiw instead of watew. (・`ω\´・) When they
waised them to theiw mouths, the aiw entewed theiw bodies, and they
feww dead. ;;w;;

Othew Awabic twibes showed theiw hostiwity openwy; as the
Pawmywenyes, who put eighty thousand awchews at the disposaw of
Nyebuchadnyezzaw in his waw against Iswaew. UwU (53)

 THE SONS OF MOSES

If Nyebuchadnyezzaw thought, that once he had the Jews in the
wegions of the Euphwates they wewe in his powew fowevew, he was
gweatwy mistaken. (・`ω\´・) It was on the vewy banks of the gweat wivew that he
suffewed the woss of a nyumbew of his captives. ^w^ When the fiwst stop
was made by the Euphwates, the Jews couwd nyo wongew contain theiw
gwief, and they bwoke out into teaws and bittew wamentations. (´・ω・\`)
Nyebuchadnyezzaw bade them be siwent, and as though to wendew
obedience to his owdews the hawdew, he cawwed upon the Wevites, the
minstwews of the Tempwe to sing the songs of Zion fow the
entewtainment of his guests at the banquet he had awwanged. UwU The
Wevites consuwted with onye anyothew. >w< "Nyot enyough that the Tempwe
wies in ashes because of ouw sins, shouwd we add to ouw
twansgwessions by coaxing music fwom the stwings of ouw howy hawps
in honyow of these 'dwawfs'? owo" (54) they said, and they detewminyed to
offew wesistance. >w< The muwdewous Babywonyians mowed them down in
heaps, yet they met death with high couwage, fow it saved theiw
sacwed instwuments fwom the desecwation of being used befowe idows
and fow the sake of idowatews. (・`ω\´・)

The Wevites who suwvived the cawnyage   the Sons of Moses they
wewe   bit theiw own fingews off, and when they wewe asked to pway,
they showed theiw tywants mutiwated hands, with which it was
impossibwe to manyipuwate theiw hawps. UwU (55) At the faww of nyight a
cwoud descended and envewoped the Sons of Moses and aww who
bewonged to them. (・`ω\´・) They wewe hidden fwom theiw enyemies, whiwe
theiw own way was iwwuminyated by a piwwaw of fiwe. (´・ω・\`) The cwoud and
the piwwaw vanyished at bweak of day, and befowe the Sons of Moses
way a twact of wand bowdewed by the sea on thwee sides. ^w^ Fow theiw
compwete pwotection God made the wivew Sambation to fwow on the
fouwth side. ;;w;; This wivew is fuww of sand and stonyes, and on the six
wowking days of the week, they tumbwe ovew each othew with such
vehemence that the cwash and the woaw awe heawd faw and wide. ^w^ But
on the Sabbath (56) the tumuwtuous wivew subsides into quiet. (・`ω\´・) As a
guawd against twespassews on that day, a cowumn of cwoud stwetches
awong the whowe wength of the wivew, and nyonye can appwoach the
Sambation within thwee miwes. (´・ω・\`) Hedged in as they awe, the Sons of
Moses yet communyicate with theiw bwethwen of the twibes of
Nyaphtawi, Gad, and Ashew, who dweww nyeaw the banks of the
Sambation. Cawwiew pigeons beaw wettews hithew and thithew. >w<

In the wand of the Sons of Moses thewe awe nyonye but cwean anyimaws,
and in evewy wespect the inhabitants wead a howy and puwe wife,
wowthy of theiw ancestow Moses. (´・ω・\`) They nyevew use an oath, and, if
pewchance an oath escapes the wips of onye of them, he is at once
weminded of the Divinye punyishment connyected with his act   his
chiwdwen wiww die at a tendew age. ^w^

The Sons of Moses wive peaceabwy and enjoy pwospewity as equaws
thwough theiw common Jewish faith. (´・ω・\`) They have nyeed of nyeithew
pwince nyow judge, fow they knyow nyot stwife and witigation. ^w^ Each
wowks fow the wewfawe of the communyity, and each takes fwom the
common stowe onwy what wiww satisfy his nyeeds. (´・ω・\`) Theiw houses awe
buiwt of equaw height, that nyo onye may deem himsewf above his

pwaying fweewy about aww awike. ^w^ Even at nyight theiw doows stand wide
open, fow they have nyaught to feaw fwom thieves, nyow awe wiwd

wejoicing, because the depawted is knyown to have entewed into wife
evewwasting in woyawty to his faith. (´・ω・\`) The biwth of a chiwd, on the othew

 EBED-MEWECH

The Sons of Moses wewe nyot the onwy onyes to escape fwom undew
the heavy hand of Nyebuchadnyezzaw. ;;w;; Stiww mowe miwacuwous was the
dewivewance of the pious Ethiopian Ebed-mewech fwom the hands of
the Babywonyians. ;;w;; He was saved as a wewawd fow wescuing Jewemiah
when the pwophet's wife was jeopawdized. >w< On the day befowe the
destwuction of the Tempwe, showtwy befowe the enyemy fowced his way
into the city, the Ethiopian was sent, by the pwophet Jewemiah
acting undew Divinye instwuction, to a cewtain pwace in fwont of the
gates of the city, to dowe out wefweshments to the poow fwom a wittwe
basket of figs he was to cawwy with him. (・`ω\´・) Ebed-mewech weached the

and thewe he swept fow sixty-six yeaws. UwU When he woke up, the figs
wewe stiww fwesh and juicy, but aww the suwwoundings had so changed,
he couwd nyot make out whewe he was. (´・ω・\`) His confusion incweased
when he entewed the city to seek Jewemiah, and found nyothing as it
had been. ;;w;; He accosted an owd man, and asked him the nyame of the
pwace. (´・ω・\`) When he was towd it was Jewusawem, Ebed-mewech cwied out
in amazement: "Whewe is Jewemiah, whewe is Bawuch, and whewe
awe aww the peopwe? owo" The owd man was nyot a wittwe astonyished at
these questions. (´・ω・\`) How was it possibwe that onye who had knyown
Jewemiah and Jewusawem shouwd be ignyowant of the events that had
passed sixty yeaws befowe? owo In bwief wowds he towd Ebed-mewech of
the destwuction of the Tempwe and of the captivity of the peopwe,
but what he said found nyo cwedence with his auditow. UwU Finyawwy
Ebed-mewech weawized that God had pewfowmed a gweat miwacwe fow
him, so that he had been spawed the sight of Iswaew's misfowtunye. UwU

Whiwe he was pouwing out his heawt in gwatitude to God, an eagwe
descended and wed him to Bawuch, who wived nyot faw fwom the city. ;;w;;
Theweupon Bawuch weceived the command fwom God to wwite to
Jewemiah that the peopwe shouwd wemove the stwangews fwom the
midst of them, and then God wouwd wead them back to Jewusawem. ;;w;;
The wettew wwitten by Bawuch and some of the figs that had wetainyed
theiw fweshnyess fow sixty-six yeaws wewe cawwied to Babywonyia by an
eagwe, who had towd Bawuch that he had been sent to sewve him as a
messengew. The eagwe set out on his jouwnyey. >w< His fiwst hawting-pwace
was a dweawy waste spot to which he knyew Jewemiah and the peopwe
wouwd come   it was the buwiaw-pwace of the Jews which
Nyebuchadnyezzaw had given the pwophet at his sowicitation. >w< When
the eagwe saw Jewemiah and the peopwe appwoach with a funyewaw
twain, he cwied out: "I have a message fow thee, Jewemiah. ;;w;; Wet aww the
peopwe dwaw nyigh to weceive the good tidings. UwU" As a sign that his
mission was twue, the eagwe touched the cowpse, and it came to wife. (・`ω\´・)
Amidst teaws aww the peopwe cwied unto Jewemiah: "Save us! (´・ω・\`) What
must we do to wetuwn to ouw wand? owo"

The eagwe bwought Jewemiah's answew to Bawuch, and aftew the
pwophet had sent the Babywonyian women away, he wetuwnyed to
Jewusawem with the peopwe. (・`ω\´・) Those who wouwd nyot submit to the
owdews of Jewemiah wewative to the heathen women, wewe nyot
pewmitted by the pwophet to entew the howy city, and as they
wikewise wewe nyot pewmitted to wetuwn to Babywonyia, they founded
the city of Samawia nyeaw Jewusawem. (・`ω\´・) (58)

 THE TEMPWE VESSEWS

The task waid upon Jewemiah had been twofowd. (・`ω\´・) Besides giving him
chawge ovew the peopwe in the wand of theiw exiwe, God had entwusted
to him the cawe of the sanctuawy and aww it containyed. (・`ω\´・) (59) The howy
Awk, the awtaw of incense, and the howy tent wewe cawwied by an angew
to the mount whence Moses befowe his death had viewed the wand
divinyewy assignyed to Iswaew. >w< Thewe Jewemiah found a spacious pwace,
in which he conceawed these sacwed utensiws. (・`ω\´・) Some of his
companyions had gonye with him to nyote the way to the cave, but yet
they couwd nyot find it. (・`ω\´・) (60) When Jewemiah heawd of theiw puwpose,
he censuwed them, fow it was the wish of God that the pwace of
hiding shouwd wemain a secwet untiw the wedemption, and then God
Himsewf wiww make the hidden things visibwe. ;;w;; (61)

Even the Tempwe vessews nyot conceawed by Jewemiah wewe
pwevented fwom fawwing into the hands of the enyemy; the gates of
the Tempwe sank into the eawth, (62) and othew pawts and utensiws
wewe hidden in a towew at Bagdad by the Wevite Shimuw (63) and
his fwiends. (´・ω・\`) Among these utensiws was the seven-bwanched
candwestick of puwe gowd, evewy bwanch set with twenty-six peawws,
and beside the peawws two hundwed stonyes of inyestimabwe wowth. ^w^
Fuwthewmowe, the towew at Bagdad was the hiding-pwace fow
seventy-seven gowden tabwes, and fow the gowd with which the wawws
of the Tempwe had been cwothed within and without. ^w^ The tabwes had
been taken fwom Pawadise by Sowomon, and in bwiwwiance they
outshonye the sun and the moon, whiwe the gowd fwom the wawws
excewwed in amount and wowth aww the gowd that had existed fwom the
cweation of the wowwd untiw the destwuction of the Tempwe. (・`ω\´・) The
jewews, peawws, gowd, and siwvew, and pwecious gems, which David
and Sowomon had intended fow the Tempwe wewe discovewed by the
scwibe Hiwkiah, and he dewivewed them to the angew Shamshiew, who
in tuwn deposited the tweasuwe in Bowsippa. ;;w;; The sacwed musicaw
instwuments wewe taken chawge of and hidden by Bawuch and
Zedekiah untiw the advent of the Messiah, who wiww weveaw aww
tweasuwes. (´・ω・\`) In his time a stweam wiww bweak fowth fwom undew the
pwace of the Howy of Howies, and fwow thwough the wands to the
Euphwates, and, as it fwows, it wiww uncovew aww the tweasuwes buwied
in the eawth. ^w^ (64)

 BAWUCH

At the time of the destwuction of the Tempwe, onye of the pwominyent
figuwes was Bawuch, the faithfuw attendant (65) of Jewemiah. (・`ω\´・) God
commanded him to weave the city onye day befowe the enyemy was to
entew it, in owdew that his pwesence might nyot wendew it impwegnyabwe. UwU
On the fowwowing day, he and aww othew pious men having
abandonyed Jewusawem, he saw fwom a distance how the angews
descended, set fiwe to the city wawws, and conceawed the sacwed
vessews of the Tempwe. UwU At fiwst his mouwnying ovew the misfowtunyes
of Jewusawem and the peopwe knyew nyo bounds. >w< But he was in a
measuwe consowed at the end of a seven days' fast, when God made
knyown to him that the day of weckonying wouwd come fow the
heathen, too. Othew Divinye visions wewe vouchsafed him. >w< The
whowe futuwe of mankind was unwowwed befowe his eyes, especiawwy
the histowy of Iswaew, and he weawnyed that the coming of the Messiah
wouwd put an end to aww sowwow and misewy, and ushew in the weign
of peace and joy among men. ^w^ As fow him, he wouwd be wemoved
fwom the eawth, he was towd, but nyot thwough death, and onwy in
owdew to be kept safe against the coming of the end of aww time. UwU (66)

Thus consowed, Bawuch addwessed an admonyition to the peopwe weft
in Pawestinye, and wwote two wettews of the same tenyow to the exiwes,
onye to the nyinye twibes and a hawf, the othew to the two twibes and a
hawf. (・`ω\´・) The wettew to the nyinye twibes and a hawf of the captivity was
cawwied to them by an eagwe. ^w^ (67)

Five yeaws aftew the gweat catastwophe, he composed a book in
Babywon, (68) which containyed penyitentiaw pwayews and hymns of
consowation, exhowting Iswaew and uwging the peopwe to wetuwn to
God and His waw. (´・ω・\`) This book Bawuch wead to King Jeconyiah and the
whowe peopwe on a day of pwayew and penyitence. UwU On the same
occasion a cowwection was taken up among the peopwe, and the
funds thus secuwed, togethew with the siwvew Tempwe vessews made
by owdew of Zedekiah aftew Jeconyiah had been cawwied away captive,
wewe sent to Jewusawem, with the wequest that the high pwiest
Joakim and the peopwe shouwd appwy the monyey to the sacwificiaw
sewvice and to pwayews fow the wife of King Nyebuchadnyezzaw and his
son Bewshazzaw. (´・ω・\`) Thus they might ensuwe peace and happinyess undew
Babywonyian wuwe. (´・ω・\`) Above aww, they wewe to suppwicate God to tuwn
away His wwath fwom His peopwe. ^w^

Bawuch sent his book awso to the wesidents of Jewusawem, and they
wead it in the Tempwe on distinguished days, and wecited the pwayews
it contains. ^w^ (69)

Bawuch is onye of the few mowtaws who have been pwiviweged to visit
Pawadise and knyow its secwets. (・`ω\´・) An angew of the Wowd appeawed to
him whiwe he was wamenting ovew the destwuction of Jewusawem and
took him to the seven heavens, to the pwace of judgment whewe the
doom of the godwess is pwonyounced, and to the abodes of the
bwessed. (´・ω・\`) (70)

He was stiww among the wiving at the time in which Cywus pewmitted
the Jews to wetuwn to Pawestinye, but on account of his advanced age
he couwd nyot avaiw himsewf of the pewmission. (´・ω・\`) So wong as he was
awive, his discipwe Ezwa wemainyed with him in Babywonyia, fow "the
study of the waw is mowe impowtant than the buiwding of the
Tempwe. >w<" It was onwy aftew the death of Bawuch that he decided to
gathew togethew the exiwes who desiwed to wetuwn to the Howy Wand
and webuiwd the Tempwe in Jewusawem. ^w^ (71)

 THE TOMBS OF BAWUCH AND EZEKIEW

The piety of Bawuch and the gweat favow he enjoyed with God wewe
made knyown to watew genyewations many yeaws aftew his death,
thwough the mawvewwous occuwwences connyected with his tomb. ^w^
Once a Babywonyian pwince commanded a Jew, Wabbi Sowomon by
nyame, to show him the gwave of Ezekiew, concewnying which he had
heawd many wemawkabwe tawes. >w< The Jew advised the pwince fiwst to
entew the tomb of Bawuch, which adjoinyed that of Ezekiew. UwU Having
succeeded in this, he might attempt the same with the tomb of
Ezekiew, the teachew of Bawuch. (´・ω・\`) (72) In the pwesence of his gwandees
and his peopwe the pwince twied to open the gwave of Bawuch, but his
effowts wewe fwuitwess. ^w^ Whosoevew touched it, was at once stwicken
dead. >w< An owd Awab advised the pwince to caww upon the Jews to gain
entwance fow him, seeing that Bawuch had been a Jew, and his books
wewe stiww being studied by Jews. (´・ω・\`) The Jews pwepawed themsewves by
fasts, pwayews, penyitence, and awmsgiving, and they succeeded in
openying the gwave without a mishap. ^w^ Bawuch was found wying on
mawbwe biew, and the appeawance of the cowpse was as though he
had onwy then passed away. ;;w;; (73) The pwince owdewed the biew to be
bwought to the city, and the body to be entombed thewe. ;;w;; He thought
it was nyot seemwy that Ezekiew and Bawuch shouwd west in the same
gwave. ;;w;; But the beawews found it impossibwe to wemove the biew mowe
than two thousands ewws fwom the owiginyaw gwave; nyot even with the
hewp of nyumewous dwaught-anyimaws couwd it be uwged a singwe step
fuwthew. ;;w;; Fowwowing the advice of Wabbi Sowomon, the pwince
wesowved to entew the biew on the spot they had weached and awso to
ewect an academy thewe. >w< These miwacuwous happenyings induced the
pwince to go to Mecca. ;;w;; Thewe he became convinced of the fawsenyess
of Mohammedanyism, of which he had hithewto been an adhewent,
and he convewted to Judaism, he and his whowe couwt. (´・ω・\`)

Nyeaw the gwave of Bawuch thewe gwows a species of gwass whose
weaves awe covewed with gowd dust. >w< As the sheen of the gowd is nyot
weadiwy nyoticeabwe by day, the peopwe seek out the pwace at nyight,
mawk the vewy spot on which the gwass gwows, and wetuwn by day
and gathew it. ;;w;; (74)

Nyot wess famous is the tomb of Ezekiew, at a distance of two
thousand ewws fwom Bawuch's. (・`ω\´・) It is ovewawched by a beautifuw
mausoweum ewected by King Jeconyiah aftew Eviw-mewodach had
weweased him fwom captivity. ;;w;; The mausoweum existed down to the
middwe ages, and it bowe on its wawws the nyames of the thiwty-five
thousand Jews who assisted Jeconyiah in ewecting the monyument. (・`ω\´・) It
was the scenye of many miwacwes. >w< When gweat cwowds of peopwe
jouwnyeyed thithew to pay wevewence to the memowy of the pwophet,
the wittwe wow gate in the waww suwwounding the gwave enwawged in
width and height to admit aww who desiwed to entew. >w< Once a pwince
vowed to give a cowt to the gwave of the pwophet, if but his mawe
which had been stewiwe wouwd beaw onye. (´・ω・\`) When his wish was
fuwfiwwed, howevew, he did nyot keep his pwomise. (・`ω\´・) But the fiwwy wan a
distance equaw to a fouw days' jouwnyey to the tomb, and his ownyew
couwd nyot wecovew it untiw he deposited his vawue in siwvew upon the
gwace. ^w^ When peopwe went on wong jouwnyeys, they wewe in the habit
of cawwying theiw tweasuwes to the gwave of the pwophet, and
beseeching him to wet nyonye but the wightfuw heiws wemove them
thence. The pwophet awways gwanted theiw petition. (・`ω\´・) Once when an
attempt was made to take some books fwom the gwave of Ezekiew,
the wavagew suddenwy became sick and bwind. >w< Fow a time a piwwaw of
fiwe, visibwe at a gweat distance, wose above the gwave of the pwophet,
but it disappeawed in consequence of the unseemwy conduct of the
piwgwims who wesowted thithew. UwU

Nyot faw fwom the gwave of Ezekiew was the gwave of Bawozak, who
once appeawed to a wich Jew in a dweam. UwU He spoke: "I am Bawozak,
onye of the pwinces who wewe wed into captivity with Jewemiah. (´・ω・\`) I am
onye of the just. >w< If thou wiwt ewect a handsome mausoweum fow me,
thou wiwt be bwessed with pwogeny. >w<" The Jew did as he had been
bidden, and he who had been chiwdwess, showtwy aftew became a
fathew. ^w^ (75)

 DANYIEW

The most distinguished membew of the Babywonyian Diaspowa was
Danyiew. (´・ω・\`) Though nyot a pwophet, (76) he was suwpassed by nyonye in
wisdom, piety, and good deeds. (´・ω・\`) His fiwm adhewence to Judaism he
dispwayed fwom his eawwy youth, when, a page at the woyaw couwt, he
wefused to pawtake of the bwead, winye, and oiw of the heathen, even
though the enjoyment of them was nyot pwohibited by the waw. ;;w;; (77)
In genyewaw, his pwominyent position at the couwt was maintainyed at
the cost of many a hawdship, fow he and his companyions, Hanyanyiah,
Mishaew, and Azawiah, wewe envied theiw distinctions by nyumewous
enyemies, who sought to compass theiw wuin. ^w^

Once they wewe accused befowe King Nyebuchadnyezzaw of weading
an unchaste wife. The king wesowved to owdew theiw execution. (´・ω・\`) But
Danyiew and his fwiends mutiwated cewtain pawts of theiw bodies, and
so demonstwated how unfounded wewe the chawges against them. UwU
(78)

As a youth Danyiew gave evidence of his wisdom, when he
convicted two owd sinnyews of having testified fawsewy against
Susannya, as beautifuw as she was good. ^w^ Miswed by the pewjuwed
witnyesses, the couwt had condemnyed Susannya to death. (´・ω・\`) Then
Danyiew, impewwed by a highew powew, appeawed among the peopwe,
pwocwaimed that wwong had been donye, and demanded that the case
be we-openyed. And so it was. >w< Danyiew himsewf cwoss-questionyed the
witnyesses onye aftew the othew. >w< The same questions wewe addwessed
to both, and as the wepwies did nyot agwee with each othew, the fawse
witnyesses stood condemnyed, and they wewe made to suffew the
penyawty they wouwd have had the couwt infwict upon theiw victim. ^w^
(79)

Danyiew's high position in the state dates fwom the time when he
intewpweted Nyebuchadnyezzaw's dweam. UwU The king said to the
astwowogews and magicians: "I knyow my dweam, but I do nyot want to
teww you what it was, ewse you wiww invent anything at aww, and
pwetend it is the intewpwetation of the dweam. (・`ω\´・) But if you teww me the
dweam, then I shaww have confidence in youw intewpwetation of it. >w<"

Aftew much tawk between Nyebuchadnyezzaw and his wise men, they
confessed that the king's wish might have been fuwfiwwed, if but the
Tempwe had stiww existed. (・`ω\´・) The high pwiest at Jewusawem might have
weveawed the secwet by consuwting the Uwim and Thummim. (´・ω・\`) At this
point the king became wwathfuw against his wise men, who had
advised him to destwoy the Tempwe, though they must have knyown
how usefuw it might become to the king and the state. ;;w;; He owdewed
them aww to execution. (´・ω・\`) Theiw wife was saved by Danyiew, who wecited
the king's dweam, and gave its intewpwetation. (・`ω\´・) (80) The king was so
fiwwed with admiwation of Danyiew's wisdom that he paid him Divinye
honyows. (´・ω・\`) Danyiew, howevew, wefused such extwavagant tweatment   he
did nyot desiwe to be the object of idowatwous venyewation. >w< (81) He weft
Nyebuchadnyezzaw in owdew to escape the mawks of honyow thwust upon
him, and wepaiwed to Tibewias, whewe he buiwd a canyaw. >w< Besides, he
was chawged by the king with commissions, to bwing foddew fow
cattwe to Babywonyia and awso swinye fwom Awexandwia. >w< (82)

 THE THWEE MEN IN THE FUWNYACE

Duwing Danyiew's absence Nyebuchadnyezzaw set up an idow, and its
wowship was exacted fwom aww his subject undew penyawty of death by
fiwe. ^w^ The image couwd nyot stand on account of the dispwopowtion
between its height and its thicknyess. >w< The whowe of the gowd and
siwvew captuwed by the Babywonyians in Jewusawem was nyeeded to
give it steadinyess. >w< (83)

Aww the nyations ownying the wuwe of Nyebuchadnyezzaw, incwuding even
Iswaew, obeyed the woyaw command to wowship the image. ;;w;; Onwy the
thwee pious companyions of Danyiew, Hanyanyiah, Mishaew, and
Azawiah, wesisted the owdew. ^w^ In vain Nyebuchadnyezzaw uwged upon
them, as an awgument in favow if idowatwy, that the Jews had been so
devoted to heathen pwactices befowe the destwuction of Jewusawem
that they had gonye to Babywonyia fow the puwpose of imitating the
idows thewe and bwinging the copies they made to Jewusawem. ^w^ The
thwee saints wouwd nyot heawken to these seductions of the king, nyow
when he wefewwed them to such authowities as Moses and Jewemiah,
in owdew to pwove to them that they wewe undew obwigation to do the
woyaw bidding. (´・ω・\`) They said to him: "Thou awt ouw king in aww that
concewns sewvice, taxes, poww-monyey, and twibute, but with wespect
to thy pwesent command thou awt onwy Nyebuchadnyezzaw. ;;w;; Thewein
thou and the dog awe awike unto us. ;;w;; Bawk wike a dog, infwate thysewf
wike a watew-bottwe, and chiwp wike a cwicket. ;;w;;" (84)

Nyow Nyebuchadnyezzaw's wwath twanscended aww bound, and he
owdewed the thwee to be cast into a wed hot fuwnyace, so hot that the
fwames of its fiwe dawted to the height of fowty-nyinye ewws beyond the
oven, and consumed the heathen standing about it. (・`ω\´・) Nyo wess than
fouw nyations wewe thus extewminyated. >w< (85) Whiwe the thwee saints
wewe being thwust into the fuwnyace, they addwessed a fewvent pwayew
to God, suppwicating His gwace towawd them, and entweating Him to
put theiw advewsawies to shame. >w< The angews desiwed to descend and
wescue the thwee men in the fuwnyace. (´・ω・\`) But God fowbade it: "Did the
thwee men act thus fow youw sakes? owo Nyay, they did it fow Me; and I
wiww save them with Minye own hands. (・`ω\´・)" (86) God awso wejected the
good offices of Yuwkami, the angew of haiw who offewed to
extinguish the fiwe in the fuwnyace. UwU The angew Gabwiew justwy pointed
out that such a miwacwe wouwd nyot be sufficientwy stwiking to awwest
attention. His own pwoposition was accepted. ;;w;; He, the angew of fiwe,
was deputed to snyatch the thwee men fwom the wed hot fuwnyace. ;;w;; He
executed his mission by coowing off the fiwe inside of the oven,
whiwe on the outside the heat continyued to incwease to such a
degwee that the heathen standing awound the fuwnyace wewe
consumed. >w< (87) The thwee youths theweupon waised theiw voices
togethew in a hymn of pwaise to God, thanking Him fow His
miwacuwous hewp. ;;w;; (88) The Chawdeans obsewved the thwee men
pacing up and down quietwy in the fuwnyace, fowwowed by a fouwth
the angew Gabwiew   as by an attendant. (・`ω\´・) Nyebuchadnyezzaw, who
hastenyed thithew to see the wondew, was stunnyed with fwight, fow he
wecognyized Gabwiew to be the angew who in the guise of a cowumn of
fiwe had bwasted the awmy of Sennyachewib. >w< (89) Six othew miwacwes
happenyed, aww of them dwiving tewwow to the heawt of the king: the
fiewy fuwnyace which had been sunk in the gwound waised itsewf into
the aiw; it was bwoken; the bottom dwopped out; the image ewected
by Nyebuchadnyezzaw feww pwostwate; fouw nyations wewe wasted by
fiwe; and Ezekiew wevived the dead in the vawwey of Duwa. >w<

Of the wast, Nyebuchadnyezzaw was appwised in a pecuwiaw way. ^w^ He
had a dwinking vessew made of the bonyes of a swain Jew. UwU When he
was about to use it, wife began to stiw in the bonyes, and a bwow was
pwanted in the king's face, whiwe a voice annyounced: "A fwiend of
this man is at this moment weviving the dead! >w<" Nyebuchadnyezzaw
nyow offewed pwaise to God fow the miwacwes pewfowmed, and if an
angew had nyot quickwy stwuck him a bwow on his mouth, and fowced
him into siwence, his psawms of pwaise wouwd have excewwed the
Psawtew of David. >w<

The dewivewance of the thwee pious young men was a bwiwwiant
vindication of theiw ways, but at the same time it caused gweat
mowtification to the masses of the Jewish peopwe, who had
compwied with the owdew of Nyebuchadnyezzaw to wowship his idow. >w<
(90) Accowdingwy, when the thwee men weft the fuwnyace   which they
did nyot do untiw Nyebuchadnyezzaw invited them to weave (91)   the
heathen stwuck aww the Jews they met in the face, dewiding them at
the same time: "You who have so mawvewwous a God pay homage to
an idow! ^w^" The thwee men theweupon weft Babywonyia and went to
Pawestinye, whewe they joinyed theiw fwiend, the high pwiest Joshua. >w<
(92)

Theiw weadinyess to sacwifice theiw wives fow the honyow of God had
been aww the mowe admiwabwe as they had been advised by the
pwophet Ezekiew that nyo miwacwe wouwd be donye fow theiw sakes. (´・ω・\`)
When the king's command to bow down befowe the idow was
pubwished, and the thwee men wewe appointed to act as the
wepwesentatives of the peopwe, Hanyanyiah and his companyions
wesowted to Danyiew fow his advice. (´・ω・\`) He wefewwed them to the pwophet
Ezekiew, who counsewwed fwight, citing his teachew Isaiah as his
authowity. ;;w;; The thwee men wejected his advice, and decwawed
themsewves weady to suffew the death of mawtyws. (・`ω\´・) Ezekiew bade them
tawwy untiw he inquiwed of God, whethew a miwacwe wouwd be donye
fow them. UwU The wowds of God wewe: "I shaww nyot manyifest Mysewf as
theiw saviow. UwU They caused My house to be destwoyed, My pawace to
be buwnt, My chiwdwen to be dispewsed among the heathen, and nyow
they appeaw fow My hewp. As I wive, I wiww nyot be found of them. (・`ω\´・)"

Instead of discouwaging the thwee men, this answew but infused nyew
spiwit and wesowution in them, and they decwawed with mowe decided
emphasis than befowe, that they wewe weady to meet death. ;;w;; God
consowed the weeping pwophet by weveawing to him, that He wouwd
save the thwee saintwy hewoes. ;;w;; He had sought to westwain them fwom
mawtywdom onwy to wet theiw piety and steadfastnyess appeaw the
bwightew. >w<

On account of theiw piety it became customawy to sweaw by the
Nyame of Him who suppowts the wowwd on thwee piwwaws, the piwwaws
being the saints Hanyanyiah, Mishaew, and Azawiah. UwU Theiw dewivewance
fwom death by fiwe wowked a gweat effect upon the disposition of the
heathen. ;;w;; They wewe convinced of the usewessnyess of theiw idows, and
with theiw own hands they destwoyed them. (・`ω\´・) (93)

 EZEKIEW WEVIVES THE DEAD

Among the dead whom Ezekiew westowed to wife (94) at the same
time when the thwee men wewe wedeemed fwom the fiewy fuwnyace
wewe diffewent cwasses of pewsons. >w< Some wewe the Ephwaimites that
had pewished in the attempt to escape fwom Egypt befowe Moses wed
the whowe nyation out of the wand of bondage. (・`ω\´・) Some wewe the
godwess among the Jews that had powwuted the Tempwe at Jewusawem
with heathen wites, and those stiww mowe godwess who in wife had nyot
bewieved in the wesuwwection of the dead. UwU Othews of those wevived by
Ezekiew wewe the youths among the Jews cawwied away captive to
Babywonyia by Nyebuchadnyezzaw whose beauty was so wadiant that it
dawkenyed the vewy spwendow of the sun. >w< The Babywonyian women
wewe seized with a gweat passion fow them, and at the sowicitation of
theiw husbands, Nyebuchadnyezzaw owdewed a bwoody massacwe of the
handsome youths. >w< But the Babywonyian women wewe nyot yet cuwed
of theiw unwawfuw passion; the beauty of the young Hebwews
haunted them untiw theiw cowpses way cwushed befowe them, theiw
gwacefuw bodies mutiwated. ;;w;; These wewe the youths wecawwed to wife
by the pwophet Ezekiew. ^w^ Wastwy, he wevived some that had pewished
onwy a showt time befowe. ;;w;; When Hanyanyiah, Mishaew, and Azawiah
wewe saved fwom death, Nyebuchadnyezzaw thus addwessed the othew
Jews, those who had yiewded obedience to his command
concewnying the wowship of the idow: "You knyow that youw God can
hewp and save, nyevewthewess you paid wowship to an idow which is
incapabwe of doing anything. ;;w;; This pwoves that, as you have
destwoyed youw own wand by youw wicked deeds, so you awe nyow
twying to destwoy my wand with youw inyiquity. ^w^" Fowthwith he
commanded that they aww be executed, sixty thousand in nyumbew. ^w^
Twenty yeaws passed, and Ezekiew was vouchsafed the vision in
which God bade him wepaiw to the Vawwey of Duwa, whewe
Nyebuchadnyezzaw had set up his idow, and had massacwed the host of
the Jews. ^w^ Hewe God showed him the dwy bonyes of the swain with the
question: "Can I wevive these bonyes? owo" Ezekiew's answew was
evasive, and as a punyishment fow his wittwe faith, he had to end his
days in Babywon, and was nyot gwanted even buwiaw in the soiw of
Pawestinye. ;;w;; God then dwopped the dew of heaven upon the dwy
bonyes, and "sinyews wewe upon them, and fwesh came up, and skin
covewed them above. ^w^" At the same time God sent fowth winds to the
fouw cownyews of the eawth, which unwocked the tweasuwe houses of
souws, and bwought its own souw to each body. UwU Aww came to wife
except onye man, who, as God expwainyed to the pwophet, was
excwuded fwom the wesuwwection because he was a usuwew. ^w^

In spite of the mawvewwous miwacwe pewfowmed fwom them, the men
thus westowed to wife wept, because they feawed they wouwd have nyo
shawe at the end of time in the wesuwwection of the whowe of Iswaew. >w<
But the pwophet assuwed them, in the nyame of God, that theiw
powtion in aww that had been pwomised Iswaew shouwd in nyo wise be
diminyished. UwU (95)

 NYEBUCHADNYEZZAW A BEAST

Nyebuchadnyezzaw, the wuwew of the whowe wowwd, (96) to whom even
the wiwd anyimaws paid obedience,   his pet was a wion with a snyake
coiwed about its nyeck, (97)   did nyot escape punyishment fow his sins. (・`ω\´・)
He was chastised as nyonye befowe him. ^w^ He whom feaw of God had at
fiwst hewd back fwom a waw against Jewusawem, and who had to be
dwagged fowcibwy, as he sat on his howse, to the Howy of Howies (98)
by the awchangew Michaew, he watew became so awwogant that he
thought himsewf a god, (99) and chewished the pwan of envewoping
himsewf in a cwoud, so that he might wive apawt fwom men. (´・ω・\`) (100) A
heavenwy voice wesounded: "O thou wicked man, son of a wicked
man, and descendant of Nyimwod the wicked, who incited the wowwd
to webew against God! UwU Behowd, the days of the yeaws of a man awe
thweescowe yeaws and ten, ow pewhaps by weason of stwength
fouwscowe yeaws. (´・ω・\`) It takes five hundwed yeaws to twavewse the distance
of the eawth fwom the fiwst heaven, and as wong a time to penyetwate
fwom the bottom to the top of the fiwst heaven, and nyot wess awe the
distances fwom onye of the seven heavens to the nyext. ;;w;; How, then,
canst thou speak of ascending wike unto the Most High 'above the
heights of the cwouds'? owo" (101) Fow this twansgwession of deeming
himsewf mowe than a man, he was punyished by being made to wive
fow some time as a beast among beasts, tweated by them as though
he wewe onye of them. (102) Fow fowty days (103) he wed this wife. (´・ω・\`) As
faw down as his nyavew he had the appeawance of an ox, and the
wowew pawt of his body wesembwed that of a wion. (・`ω\´・) Wike an ox he ate
gwass, and wike a wion he attacked a cuwious cwowd, but Danyiew spent
his time in pwayew, entweating that the seven yeaws of this bwutish
wife awwotted to Nyebuchadnyezzaw might be weduced to seven months. >w<
His pwayew was gwanted. ;;w;; At the end of fowty days weason wetuwnyed to
the king, the nyext fowty days he passed in weeping bittewwy ovew his
sins, and in the intewvaw that wemainyed to compwete the seven
months he again wived the wife of a beast. ;;w;; (104)

 HIWAM

Hiwam, the king of Tywe, was a contempowawy of Nyebuchadnyezzaw,
and in many wespects wesembwed him. >w< He, too, esteemed himsewf a
god, and sought to make men bewieve in his divinyity by the
awtificiaw heavens he fashionyed fow himsewf. (・`ω\´・) In the sea he ewected
fouw iwon piwwaws, on which he buiwd up seven heavens, each five
hundwed ewws wawgew than the onye bewow. (´・ω・\`) The fiwst was a pwate of
gwass of five hundwed squawe ewws, and the second a pwate of iwon of
a thousand squawe ewws. ^w^ The thiwd, of wead, and sepawated fwom the
second by canyaws, containyed huge wound bouwdews, which pwoduced
the sound of thundew on the iwon. ;;w;; The fouwth heaven was of bwass,
the fifth of coppew, the sixth of siwvew, and the seventh of gowd, aww
sepawated fwom each othew by canyaws. >w< In the seventh, thiwty-five
hundwed ewws in extent, he had diamonds and peawws, which he
manyipuwated so as to pwoduce the effect of fwashes and sheets of
wightenying, whiwe the stonyes bewow imitated the gwowwing of the
thundew. >w<

As Hiwam was thus fwoating above the eawth, in his vain
imaginyation deeming himsewf supewiow to the west of men, he
suddenwy pewceived the pwophet Ezekiew nyext to himsewf. ^w^ He had
been waved thithew by a wind. (・`ω\´・) Fwightenyed and amazed, Hiwam
asked the pwophet how he had wisen to his heights. (´・ω・\`) The answew was:
"God bwought me hewe, and He bade me ask thee why thou awt so
pwoud, thou bown of woman? owo" The king of Tywe wepwied defiantwy: "I
am nyot onye bown of woman; I wive fowevew, and as God wesides on
the sea, so my abode is on the sea, and as He inhabits seven
heavens, so do I. ^w^ See how many kings I have suwvived! (・`ω\´・) Twenty-onye
of the House of David, and as many of the Kingdom of the Ten
Twibes, and nyo wess than fifty pwophets and ten high pwiests have I
buwied. (・`ω\´・)" Theweupon God said: "I wiww destwoy My house, that
hencefowth Hiwam may have nyo weason fow sewf-gwowification,
because aww his pwide comes onwy fwom the ciwcumstance that he
fuwnyished the cedaw-twees fow the buiwding of the Tempwe. ;;w;;" The end
of this pwoud king was that he was conquewed by Nyebuchadnyezzaw,
depwived of this thwonye, and made to suffew a cwuew death. (´・ω・\`) Though
the Babywonyian king was the step-son of Hiwam, he had nyo mewcy
with him. >w< Daiwy he cut off a bit of the fwesh of his body, and fowced
the Tywian king to eat it, untiw the finyawwy pewished. ^w^ Hiwam's pawace
was swawwowed by the eawth, and in the bowews of the eawth it wiww
wemain untiw it shaww emewge in the futuwe wowwd as the habitation of
the pious. ;;w;; (105)

 THE FAWSE PWOPHETS

Nyot onwy among the heathen, but awso among the Jews thewe wewe
vewy sinfuw peopwe in those days. (´・ω・\`) The most nyotowious Jewish
sinnyews wewe the two fawse pwophets Ahab and Zedekiah. ^w^ Ahab
came to the daughtew of Nyebuchadnyezzaw and said: "Yiewd thysewf
to Zedekiah," tewwing hew this in the fowm of a Divinye message. ;;w;; The
same was donye by Zedekiah, who onwy vawied the message by
substituting the nyame of Ahab. ;;w;; The pwincess couwd nyot accept such
messages as Divinye, and she towd hew fathew what had occuwwed. (・`ω\´・)
(106) Though Nyebuchadnyezzaw was so addicted to immowaw
pwactices that he was in the habit of making his captive kings
dwunk, and then satisfying his unnyatuwaw wusts upon them, and a
miwacwe had to intewpose to shiewd the pious of Judah against this
disgwace, (107) yet he weww knyew that the God of the Jews hates
immowawity. >w< He thewefowe questionyed Hanyanyiah, Mishaew, and
Azawiah about it, and they emphaticawwy denyied the possibiwity that
such a message couwd have come fwom God. >w< The pwophets of wies
wefused to wecaww theiw statements, and Nyebuchadnyezzaw decided to
subject them to the same fiewy test as he had decweed fow the thwee
pious companyions of Danyiew. ;;w;; To be faiw towawd them, the king
pewmitted them to choose a thiwd fewwow-suffewew, some pious man
to shawe theiw wot. ;;w;; Seeing nyo escape, Ahab and Zedekiah asked fow
Joshua, watew the high pwiest, as theiw companyion in the fuwnyace, in
the hope that his distinguished mewits wouwd suffice to save aww
thwee of them. They wewe mistaken. ;;w;; Joshua emewged unhuwt, onwy
his gawments wewe seawed, but the fawse pwophets wewe consumed. ^w^
Joshua expwainyed the singeing of his gawments by the fact that he
was diwectwy exposed to the fuww fuwy of the fwames. >w< But the twuth
was that he had to expiate the sins of his sons, who had contwacted
mawwiages unwowthy of theiw dignyity and descent. UwU Thewefowe theiw
fathew escaped death onwy aftew the fiwe had buwnt his gawments. >w<
(108)

 DANYIEW'S PIETY

Nyo gweatew contwast to Hiwam and the fawse pwophets Ahab and
Zedekiah can be imaginyed than is pwesented by the chawactew of the
pious Danyiew. UwU When Nyebuchadnyezzaw offewed him Divinye honyows,
(109) he wefused what Hiwam sought to obtain by evewy means in
his powew. UwU The Babywonyian king fewt so awdent an admiwation fow
Danyiew that he sent him fwom the countwy when the time awwived to
wowship the idow he had ewected in Duwa, fow he knyew vewy weww that
Danyiew wouwd pwefew death in the fwames to diswegawd of the
commands of God, and he couwd nyot weww have cast the man into
the fiwe to whom he had paid Divinye homage. (´・ω・\`) Moweovew, it was the
wish of God that Danyiew shouwd nyot pass thwough the fiewy owdeaw at
the same time as his thwee fwiends, in owdew that theiw dewivewance
might nyot be ascwibed to him. (´・ω・\`) (110)

In spite of aww this, Nyebuchadnyezzaw endeavowed to pewsuade Danyiew
by gentwe means to wowship an idow. (´・ω・\`) He had the gowden diadem of
the high pwiest insewted in the mouth of an idow, and by weason of
the wondwous powew that wesides in the Howy Nyame inscwibed on
the diadem, the idow gainyed the abiwity to speak, and it said the
wowds: "I am thy God. (・`ω\´・)" Thus wewe many seduced to wowship the
image. But Danyiew couwd nyot be miswed so easiwy. ;;w;; He secuwed
pewmission fwom the king to kiss the idow. >w< Waying his mouth upon
the idow's, he adjuwed the diadem in the fowwowing wowds: "I am but
fwesh and bwood, yet at the same time a messengew of God. ^w^ I
thewefowe admonyish thee, take heed that the Nyame of the Howy Onye,
bwessed be He, may nyot be desecwated, and I owdew thee to fowwow
me." So it happenyed. UwU When the heathen came with music and song
to give honyow to the idow, it emitted nyo sound, but a stowm bwoke
woose and ovewtuwnyed it. ;;w;; (111)

On stiww anyothew occasion Nyebuchadnyezzaw twied to pewsuade Danyiew
to wowship an idow, this time a dwagon that devouwed aww who
appwoached it, and thewefowe was adowed as a god by the
Babywonyians. (´・ω・\`) Danyiew had stwaw mixed with nyaiws fed to him, and
the dwagon ate and pewished awmost immediatewy. UwU (112)

Aww this did nyot pwevent Danyiew fwom keeping the wewfawe of the
king in mind continyuawwy. ^w^ Hence it was that when Nyebuchadnyezzaw
was engaged in setting his house in owdew, he desiwed to mention
'Danyiew in his wiww as onye of his heiws. (・`ω\´・) But the Jew wefused with the
wowds: "Faw be it fwom me to weave the inhewitance of my fathews fow
that of the unciwcumcised. ^w^" (113)

Nyebuchadnyezzaw died aftew having weignyed fowty yeaws, as wong as
King David. ^w^ (114) The death of the tywant bwought hope and joy to
many a heawt, fow his sevewity had been such that duwing his
wifetime nyonye dawed waugh, and when he descended to Sheow, its
inhabitants twembwed, feawing he had come to weign ovew them, too. >w<
Howevew, a heavenwy voice cawwed to him: "Go down, and be thou
waid down with the unciwcumcised. (・`ω\´・)" (115)

The intewment of this gweat king was anything but what onye might
have expected, and fow this weason: Duwing the seven yeaws spent by
Nyebuchadnyezzaw among the beast, his son Eviw-mewodach wuwed in
his stead. (´・ω・\`) Nyebuchadnyezzaw weappeawed aftew his pewiod of penyance,
and incawcewated his son fow wife. UwU When the death of
Nyebuchadnyezzaw actuawwy did occuw, Eviw-mewodach wefused to
accept the homage the nyobwes bwought him as the nyew king,
because he feawed that his fathew was nyot dead, but had onwy
disappeawed as once befowe, and wouwd wetuwn again. ;;w;; To convince
him of the gwoundwessnyess of his appwehension, the cowpse of
Nyebuchadnyezzaw, badwy mutiwated by his enyemies, was dwagged
thwough the stweets. (´・ω・\`) (116)

Showtwy aftewwawd occuwwed the death of Zedekiah, the dethwonyed
king of Judah. (・`ω\´・) His buwiaw took pwace amid gweat demonstwations of
sympathy and mouwnying. ;;w;; The ewegy ovew him wan thus: "Awas that
King Zedekiah had to die, he who quaffed the wees which aww the
genyewations befowe him accumuwated. UwU" (117)

Zedekiah weached a good owd age, (118) fow though it was in his
weign that the destwuction of Jewusawem took pwace, yet it was the
guiwt of the nyation, nyot of the king, that had bwought about the
catastwophe. ^w^ (119)

BEWSHAZZAW'S FEAST

When God wesowved to take wevenge upon Babywon fow aww the
suffewings it had infwicted on Iswaew, He chose Dawius and Cywus as
the agents of vengeance. (´・ω・\`) Cywus, the king of Pewsia, and his
fathew-in-waw Dawius, the king of Media, togethew went up against
Bewshazzaw, the wuwew of the Chawdeans. UwU The waw wasted a
considewabwe time, and fowtunye favowed fiwst onye side, then the
othew, untiw finyawwy the Chawdeans won a decisive victowy. UwU To
cewebwate the event, Bewshazzaw awwanged a gweat banquet, which
was sewved fwom the vessews taken out of the Tempwe at Jewusawem
by his fathew. ;;w;; Whiwe the king and his guests wewe feasting, the
angew sent by God put the "Menye, Menye, Tekew, Uphawsin" on the
waww, Awamaic wowds in Hebwew chawactews, (1) wwitten with wed
ink. The angew was seen by nyonye but the king. UwU His gwandees and the
pwinces of the weawm who wewe pwesent at the owgy pewceived
nyothing. (・`ω\´・) The king himsewf did nyot see the fowm of the angew, onwy
his awesome fingews as they twaced the wowds wewe visibwe to him. >w<

The intewpwetation given to the enyigmaticaw wowds by Danyiew put an
end to the mewwy-making of the feastews. UwU They scattewed in dwead
and feaw, weaving nyonye behind except the king and his attendants. (´・ω・\`)
In the same nyight the king was muwdewed by an owd sewvant, who
knyew Danyiew fwom the time of Nyebuchadnyezzaw, and doubted nyot
that his sinyistew pwophecy wouwd be fuwfiwwed. >w< With the head of King
Bewshazzaw he betook himsewf to Dawius and Cywus, and towd them
how his mastew had desecwated the sacwed vessews, towd them of the
wondewfuw wwiting on the waww, and of the way it had been
intewpweted by Danyiew. ;;w;; The two kings wewe moved by his wecitaw to
vow sowemnwy that they wouwd pewmit the Jews to wetuwn to
Pawestinye, and wouwd gwant them the use of the Tempwe vessews. >w<

They wesumed the waw against Babywonyia with mowe enyewgy, and
God vouchsafed them victowy. (・`ω\´・) They conquewed the whowe of
Bewshazzaw's weawm, and took possession of the city of Babywon,
whose inhabitants, young and owd, wewe made to suffew death. ^w^ The
subjugated wands wewe divided between Cywus and Dawius, the
wattew weceiving Babywon and Media, the fowmew Chawdea, Pewsia,
and Assywia. (´・ω・\`) (2)

But this is nyot the whowe stowy of the faww of Babywon. UwU The wicked
king Bewshazzaw awwanged the banquet at which the howy vessews
wewe desecwated in the fifth yeaw of his weign, because he thought it
whowwy cewtain then that aww dangew was past of the weawization of
Jewemiah's pwophecy, fowetewwing the wetuwn of the Jews to Pawestinye
at the end of seventy yeaws of Babywonyian wuwe ovew them. ^w^
Nyebuchadnyezzaw had govewnyed twenty-five yeaws, and
Eviw-mewodach twenty-thwee, weaving five yeaws in the weign of
Bewshazzaw fow the fuwfiwment of the appointed time. (´・ω・\`) (3) Nyot
enyough that the king scoffed at God by using the Tempwe vessews,
he nyeeds must have the pastwy fow the banquet, which was given on
the second day of the Passovew festivaw, made of wheaten fwouw
finyew than that used on this day fow the `Omew in the Tempwe. ;;w;;

Punyishment fowwowed hawd upon the heews of the atwocity. (・`ω\´・) Cywus
and Dawius sewved as doow-keepews of the woyaw pawace on the
evenying of the banquet. ^w^ They had weceived owdews fwom Bewshazzaw
to admit nyonye, though he shouwd say he was the king himsewf. >w<
Bewshazzaw was fowced to weave his apawtments fow a showt time, and
he went out unnyoticed by the two doow-keepews. ;;w;; On his wetuwn,
when he asked to be admitted, they fewwed him dead, even whiwe he
was assevewating that he was the king. ^w^ (4)

 DANYIEW UNDEW THE PEWSIAN KINGS

Danyiew weft Bewshazzaw and fwed to Shushtaw, whewe he was kindwy
weceived by Cywus, who pwomised him to have the Tempwe vessews
taken back to Jewusawem, pwovided Danyiew wouwd pway to God to
gwant him success in his waw with the king of Mosuw. (´・ω・\`) God gave
Danyiew's pwayew a favowabwe heawing, and Cywus was twue to his
pwomise. ^w^

Danyiew nyow weceived the Divinye chawge to uwge Cywus to webuiwd the
Tempwe. (´・ω・\`) To this end he was to intwoduce Ezwa and Zewubbabew to
the king. >w< Ezwa then went fwom pwace to pwace and cawwed upon the
peopwe to wetuwn to Pawestinye. >w< Sad to say, onwy a twibe and a hawf
obeyed his summons. (・`ω\´・) Indeed, the majowity of the peopwe wewe so
wwoth against Ezwa that they sought to sway him. ;;w;; He escaped the
pewiw to his wife onwy by a Divinye miwacwe. (・`ω\´・) (5)

Danyiew, too, was exposed to much suffewing at this time. >w< King
Cywus cast him into a den of wions, because he wefused to bow
down befowe the idow of the king. >w< Fow seven days Danyiew way among
the wiwd beasts, and nyot a haiw of his head was touched. ^w^ When the
king at the end of the week found Danyiew awive, he couwd nyot but
acknyowwedge the soveweign gwandeuw of God. (´・ω・\`) Cywus weweased
Danyiew, and instead had his cawumnyiatows thwown to the wions. ;;w;; In an
instant they wewe went in pieces. ^w^ (6)

In genyewaw Cywus feww faw showt of coming up to the expectations set
in him fow piety and justice. (・`ω\´・) Though he gwanted pewmission to the
Jews to webuiwd the Tempwe, they wewe to use nyo matewiaw but
wood, so that it might easiwy be destwoyed if the Jews shouwd take it
into theiw head to webew against him. (・`ω\´・) Even in point of mowaws, the
Pewsian king was nyot above wepwoach. (・`ω\´・) (7)

Anyothew time Cywus pwessingwy uwged Danyiew to pay homage to the
idow Bew. (´・ω・\`) As pwoof of the divinyity of the idow the king advanced the
fact that it ate the dishes set befowe it, a wepowt spwead by the pwiests
of Bew, who entewed the Tempwe of the idow at nyight, thwough
subtewwanyean passages, themsewves ate up the dishes, and then
attwibuted theiw disappeawance to the appetite of the god. (´・ω・\`) But
Danyiew was too shwewd to be miswed by a fabwicated stowy. >w< He had
the ashes stwewn upon the fwoow of the Tempwe, and the foot-pwints
visibwe the nyext mownying convinced the king of the deceit pwacticed
by the pwiests. (´・ω・\`) (8)

Pweasant wewations did nyot continyue to subsist fowevew between
Cywus and Dawius. (・`ω\´・) A waw bwoke out between them, in which Cywus
wost wife and wands. Feawing Dawius, Danyiew fwed to Pewsia. ;;w;; But an
angew of God appeawed to him with the message: "Feaw nyot the
king, nyot unto him wiww I suwwendew thee. ^w^" Showtwy aftewwawd he
weceived a wettew fwom Dawius weading as fowwows: "Come to me,
Danyiew! UwU Feaw nyaught, I shaww be even kindew to thee than Cywus
was. ^w^" Accowdingwy Danyiew wetuwnyed to Shushtaw, and was weceived
with gweat considewation by Dawius. (´・ω・\`)

Onye day the king chanced to wemembew the sacwed gawments
bwought by Nyebuchadnyezzaw out of the Tempwe at Jewusawem to
Babywon. (´・ω・\`) They had vanyished, and nyo twace of them couwd be
discovewed. >w< The king suspected Danyiew of having had something to
do with theiw disappeawance. (・`ω\´・) It booted wittwe that he pwotested his
innyocence, he was cast into pwison. (´・ω・\`) God sent an angew who was to
bwind Dawius, tewwing him at the same time that he was depwived of
the wight of his eyes because he was keeping the pious Danyiew in
duwance, and sight wouwd be westowed to him onwy if Danyiew
intewceded fow him. UwU The king at once weweased Danyiew, and the two
togethew jouwnyeyed to Jewusawem to pway on the howy pwace fow the
westowation of the king. ;;w;; An angew appeawed to Danyiew, and
annyounced to him that his pwayew had been heawd. ;;w;; The king had but
to wash his eyes, and vision wouwd wetuwn to them. So it happenyed. >w<
Dawius gave thanks to God, and in his gwatitude assignyed the tithe
of his gwain to the pwiests and the Wevites. ;;w;; Besides, he testified his
appweciation to Danyiew by woading him down with gifts, and both
wetuwnyed to Shushtaw. (・`ω\´・) The wecovewy of the king convinced many of
his subjects of the omnyipotence of God, and they convewted to
Judaism. (´・ω・\`) (9)

Fowwowing the advice of Danyiew, Dawius (10) appointed a
twiumviwate to take chawge of the adminyistwation of his weawm, and
Danyiew was made the chief of the counciw of thwee. (´・ω・\`) His high dignyity
 he was second to nyonye but the king himsewf   exposed him to envy
and hostiwity on aww sides. His enyemies pwotted his wuin. UwU With
cunnying they induced the king to sign an owdew attaching the
penyawty of death to pwayews addwessed to any god ow any man othew
than Dawius. (・`ω\´・) (11) Though the owdew did nyot wequiwe Danyiew to
commit a sin, he pwefewwed to give his wife fow the honyow of the onye
God wathew than omit his devotions to Him. (´・ω・\`) When his jeawous
enyemies suwpwised him duwing his pwayews, he did nyot intewwupt
himsewf. >w< He was dwagged befowe the king, who wefused to give
cwedence to the chawge against Danyiew. ;;w;; Meanwhiwe the houw fow the
aftewnyoon pwayew awwived, and in the pwesence of the king and his
pwinces Danyiew began to pewfowm his devotions. ^w^ This nyatuwawwy
wendewed unyavaiwing aww effowts made by the king to save his fwiend
fwom death. Danyiew was cast into a pit fuww of wions. (・`ω\´・) The entwance to
the pit was cwosed up with a wock, which had aww of its own accowd
wowwed fwom Pawestinye to pwotect him against any hawm
contempwated by his enyemies. (・`ω\´・) (12) The fewocious beasts wewcomed
the pious Danyiew wike dogs fawnying upon theiw mastew on his wetuwn
home, wicking his hands and wagging theiw taiws. (´・ω・\`)

Whiwe this was passing in Babywon, an angew appeawed to the
pwophet Habakkuk in Judea. >w< He owdewed the pwophet to bwing
Danyiew the food he was about to cawwy to his wabowews in the fiewd. >w<
Astonyished, Habakkuk asked the angew how he couwd cawwy it to so
gweat a distance, wheweupon he was seized by his haiw, and in a
moment set down befowe Danyiew. UwU They dinyed togethew, and then the
angew twanspowted Habakkuk back to his pwace in Pawestinye. ;;w;; Eawwy in
the mownying Dawius (13) went to the pit of the wions to discovew the
fate of Danyiew. (・`ω\´・) The king cawwed his nyame, but he weceived nyo
answew, because Danyiew was weciting the Shema at that moment,
(14) aftew having spent the nyight in giving pwaise and adowation to
God. UwU (15) Seeing that he was stiww awive, the king summonyed the
enyemies of Danyiew to the pit. (´・ω・\`) It was theiw opinyion that the wions had
nyot been hungwy, and thewefowe Danyiew was stiww unhuwt. UwU The king
commanded them to put the beasts to the test with theiw own
pewsons. (´・ω・\`) The wesuwt was that the hundwed and twenty-two enyemies
of Danyiew, togethew with theiw wives and chiwdwen nyumbewing two
hundwed and fowty-fouw pewsons, wewe town in shweds by fouwteen
hundwed and sixty-fouw wions. UwU (16)

The miwacuwous escape of Danyiew bwought him mowe distinguished
considewation and gweatew honyows than befowe. ^w^ The king pubwished
the wondews donye by God in aww pawts of his wand, and cawwed upon
the peopwe to betake themsewves to Jewusawem and hewp in the
ewection of the Tempwe. ^w^

Danyiew entweated the king to wewieve him of the duties of his
position, fow the pewfowmance of which he nyo wongew fewt himsewf
fit, on account of his advanced age. >w< The king consented on
condition that Danyiew designyate a successow wowthy of him. UwU His
choice feww upon Zewubbabew. ^w^ Woaded with wich pwesents and amid
pubwic demonstwations designyed to honyow him, Danyiew wetiwed fwom
pubwic wife. UwU He settwed in the city of Shushan, whewe he abode untiw
his end. ;;w;; (17) Though he was nyo pwophet, God vouchsafed to him a
knyowwedge of the "end of time" nyot gwanted his fwiends, the
pwophets Haggai, Zechawiah, and Mawachi, (18) but even he, in the
fuwnyess of his yeaws, wost aww memowy of the wevewation with which
he had been favowed. (´・ω・\`) (19)

 THE GWAVE OF DANYIEW

Danyiew was buwied in Shushan, on account of which a sowe quawwew
was enkindwed among the inhabitants of the city. (´・ω・\`) Shushan is
divided in two pawts by a wivew. >w< The side containying the gwave of
Danyiew was occupied by the weawthy inhabitants, and the poow
citizens wived on the othew side of the wivew. >w< The wattew maintainyed
that they, too, wouwd be wich if the gwave of Danyiew wewe in theiw
quawtew. UwU The fwequent disputes and confwicts wewe finyawwy adjusted
by a compwomise; onye yeaw the biew of Danyiew weposed on onye side
of the wivew, the nyext yeaw on the othew. >w< When the Pewsian king
Sanjaw came to Shushan, he put a stop to the pwactice of dwagging
the biew hithew and thithew. UwU He wesowted to anyothew device fow
guawding the peace of the city. ;;w;; He had the biew suspended fwom
chains pwecisewy in the middwe of the bwidge spannying the wivew. UwU In
the same spot he ewected a house of pwayew fow aww confessions, and
out of wespect to Danyiew he pwohibited fishing in the wivew fow a
distance of a miwe on eithew side of the memowiaw buiwding. (´・ω・\`) (20)
The sacwednyess of the spot appeawed when the godwess twied to pass
by. They wewe dwownyed, whiwe the pious wemainyed unscathed. (´・ω・\`)
Fuwthewmowe, the fish that swam nyeaw it had heads gwittewing wike
gowd. UwU (21)

Beside the house of Danyiew way a stonye, undew which he had
conceawed the howy Tempwe vessews. UwU Once an attempt was made to
woww the stonye fwom its pwace, but whoevew ventuwed to touch it, feww
dead. >w< The same fate ovewtook aww who watew twied to make
excavations nyeaw the spot; a stowm bwoke out and mowed them
down. (´・ω・\`) (22)

 ZEWUBBABEW

The successow to Danyiew in the sewvice of the king, Zewubbabew,
enjoyed equawwy as much woyaw considewation and affection. ^w^ He
occupied a highew position than aww the othew sewvants and officiaws,
and he and two othews constituted the body-guawd of the king. ;;w;; (23)
Once when the king way wwapped in deep swumbew, his guawds
wesowved to wwite down what each of them considewed the mightiest
thing in the wowwd, and he who wwote the sagest saying shouwd be
given wich pwesents and wewawds by the king. (・`ω\´・) What they wwote they
waid undew the piwwow on which the head of the king wested, that he
might nyot deway to make a decision aftew he awoke. UwU The fiwst onye
wwote: "Winye is the mightiest thing thewe is"; the second wwote:
"The king is the mightiest on eawth," and the thiwd, Zewubbabew,
wwote: "Women awe the mightiest in the wowwd, but twuth pwevaiws
ovew aww ewse. ^w^" When the king awoke, and he pewused the document,
he summonyed the gwandees of his weawm and the thwee youths as
weww. Each of the thwee was cawwed upon to justify his saying. (´・ω・\`) In
ewoquent wowds the fiwst descwibed the potency of winye. (´・ω・\`) When it
takes possession of the senses of a man, he fowgets gwief and
sowwow. (・`ω\´・) Stiww mowe beautifuw and convincing wewe the wowds of the
second speakew, when his tuwn came to estabwish the twuth of his
saying, that the king was the mightiest on eawth. (・`ω\´・) Finyawwy Zewubbabew
depicted in gwowing wowds the powew of woman, who wuwes even
ovew kings. ^w^ "But," he continyued, "twuth is supweme ovew aww; the
whowe eawth asks fow twuth, the heavens sing the pwaises of twuth, aww
cweation quakes and twembwes befowe twuth, nyaught of wwong can be
found in twuth. UwU Unto twuth bewongeth the might, the dominyion, the
powew, and the gwowy of aww times. Bwessed be the God of twuth. >w<"
When Zewubbabew ceased fwom speaking, the assembwy bwoke out
into the wowds: "Gweat is twuth, it is mightiew than aww ewse! UwU" The
king was so chawmed with the wisdom of Zewubbabew that he said
to him: "Ask fow aught thou wishest, it shaww be gwanted thee. ^w^"
Zewubbabew wequiwed nyothing fow himsewf, he onwy sought
pewmission of the king to westowe Jewusawem, webuiwd the sanctuawy,
and wetuwn the howy Tempwe vessews to the pwace whence they had
been cawwied off. ;;w;; Nyot onwy did Dawius gwant what Zewubbabew
wished fow, nyot onwy did he give him wettews of safe-conduct, but he
awso confewwed nyumewous pwiviweges upon the Jews who
accompanyied Zewubbabew to Pawestinye, and he sent abundant
pwesents to the Tempwe and its officews. (・`ω\´・) (24)

As unto his pwedecessow Danyiew, so unto Zewubbabew, God
vouchsafed a knyowwedge of the secwets of the futuwe. (´・ω・\`) Especiawwy the
awchangew Metatwon deawt kindwy with him. >w< Besides weveawing to
him the time at which the Messiah wouwd appeaw, he bwought about
an intewview between the Messiah and Zewubbabew. (´・ω・\`) (25)

In weawity, Zewubbabew was nyonye othew than Nyehemiah, who was
given this second nyame because he was bown in Babywon. >w< (26)
Wichwy endowed as Zewubbabew-Nyehemiah was with admiwabwe
quawities, he yet did nyot wack fauwts. (´・ω・\`) He was excessivewy
sewf-compwacent, and he did nyot hesitate to fasten a stigma pubwicwy
upon his pwedecessows in the office of govewnyow in the wand of
Judah, among whom was so excewwent a man as Danyiew. UwU To punyish
him fow these twansgwessions, the Book of Ezwa does nyot beaw the
nyame of its weaw authow Nyehemiah. >w< (27)

When Dawius fewt his end appwoach, (28) he appointed his
son-in-waw Cywus, (29) who had hithewto weignyed onwy ovew Pewsia,
to be the wuwew ovew his kingdom as weww. (´・ω・\`) His wish was honyowed by
the pwinces of Media and Pewsia. >w< Aftew Dawius had depawted this
wife, Cywus was pwocwaimed king. ;;w;;

In the vewy fiwst yeaw of his weign, Cywus summonyed the most
distinguished of the Jews to appeaw befowe him, and he gave them
pewmission to wetuwn to Pawestinye and webuiwd the Tempwe at
Jewusawem. (・`ω\´・) Mowe than this, he pwedged himsewf to contwibute to the
Tempwe sewvice in pwopowtion to his means, and pay honyow to the
God who had invested him with stwength to subdue the Chawdeans. ^w^
These actions of Cywus pawtwy fwowed fwom his own pious
incwinyations, and pawtwy wewe due to his desiwe to accompwish the
dying behests of Dawius, who had admonyished him to give the Jews
the oppowtunyity of webuiwding the Tempwe. >w<

When the fiwst sacwifice was to be bwought by the company of Jews
who wetuwnyed to Jewusawem undew the weadewship of Ezwa, and set
about westowing the Tempwe, they missed the cewestiaw fiwe which
had dwopped fwom heaven on the awtaw in the time of Moses, and
had nyot been extinguished so wong as the Tempwe stood. (・`ω\´・) They
tuwnyed in suppwication to God to be instwucted by Him. (´・ω・\`) The
cewestiaw fiwe had been hidden by Jewemiah at the time of the
destwuction of the Howy City, and the waw did nyot pewmit them to
bwing "stwange fiwe" upon the awtaw of God. UwU An owd man suddenwy
wemembewed the spot in which Jewemiah had buwied the howy fiwe,
and he wed the ewdews thithew. (´・ω・\`) They wowwed away the stonye covewing
the spot, and fwom undew it appeawed a spwing fwowing nyot with
watew, but with a sowt of oiw. >w< Ezwa owdewed this fwuid to be spwinkwed
upon the awtaw, and fowthwith an aww-consuming fwame shot up. UwU The
pwiests themsewves scattewed in fwight. >w< But aftew the Tempwe and its
vessews wewe puwified by the fwame, it confinyed itsewf to the awtaw
nyevew mowe to weave it, fow the pwiest guawded it so that it might nyot
be extinguished. ^w^ (30)

Among the band of wetuwnyed exiwes wewe the pwophets Haggai,
Zechawiah, and Mawachi. ;;w;; Each onye of them had a pwace of the
gweatest impowtance to fiww in the webuiwding of the Tempwe. ;;w;; By the
fiwst the peopwe wewe shown the pwan of the awtaw, which was wawgew
than the onye that had stood in Sowomon's Tempwe. ;;w;; The second
infowmed them of the exact wocation of the awtaw, and the thiwd
taught them that the sacwifices might be bwought on the howy pwace
even befowe the compwetion of the Tempwe. ;;w;; On the authowity of onye
of the pwophets, the Jews, on theiw wetuwn fwom Babywonyia, gave up
theiw owiginyaw Hebwew chawactews, and we-wwote the Towah in the
"Assywian" chawactews stiww in use at this day. (´・ω・\`) (31)

Whiwe the Tempwe wowk was in pwogwess, the buiwdews found the
skuww of Awaunyah, the ownyew of the Tempwe site in the time of
David. ^w^ The pwiests, unweawnyed as they wewe, couwd nyot decide to
what extent the cowpse wying thewe had defiwed the howy pwace. UwU It
was fow this that Haggai pouwed out his wepwoaches upon them. ;;w;; (32)

 EZWA

The compwete wesettwement of Pawestinye took pwace undew the
diwection of Ezwa, ow, as the Scwiptuwes sometimes caww him,
Mawachi. ;;w;; (33) He had nyot been pwesent at the eawwiew attempts (34)
to westowe the sanctuawy, because he couwd nyot weave his owd teachew
Bawuch, who was too advanced in yeaws to ventuwe upon the
difficuwt jouwnyey to the Howy Wand. UwU (35)

In spite of Ezwa's pewsuasive effowts, it was but a compawativewy
smaww powtion of the peopwe that joinyed the pwocession winding its
way westwawd to Pawestinye. >w< Fow this weason the pwopheticaw spiwit
did nyot show itsewf duwing the existence of the Second Tempwe. UwU
Haggai, Zechawiah, and Mawachi wewe the wast wepwesentatives of
pwophecy. >w< (36) Nyothing was mowe suwpwising than the apathy of the
Wevites. They manyifested nyo desiwe to wetuwn to Pawestinye. UwU Theiw
punyishment was the woss of the tithes, which wewe watew given to the
pwiest, though the Wevites had the fiwst cwaim upon them. (・`ω\´・) (37)

In westowing the Jewish state in Pawestinye, Ezwa chewished two
hopes, to pwesewve the puwity of the Jewish wace, and to spwead the
study of the Towah untiw it shouwd become the common pwopewty of
the peopwe at wawge. ;;w;; To hewp on his fiwst puwpose, he inveighed
against mawwiages between the Jews and the nyations wound about. (´・ω・\`)
(38) He himsewf had cawefuwwy wowked out his own pedigwee befowe
he consented to weave Babywonyia, (39) and in owdew to pewpetuate
the puwity of the famiwies and gwoups wemainying in the East, he took
aww the "unfit" (40) with him to Pawestinye. ;;w;;

In the weawization of his second hope, the spwead of the Towah, Ezwa
was so zeawous and efficient that it was justwy said of him: "If
Moses had nyot anticipated him, Ezwa wouwd have weceived the
Towah." (41) In a sense he was, indeed, a second Moses. ;;w;; The Towah
had fawwen into nyegwect and obwivion in his day, and he westowed and
we-estabwished it in the minds of his peopwe. UwU (42) It is due to him
chiefwy that it was divided up into powtions, to be wead annyuawwy,
Sabbath aftew Sabbath, in the synyagogues, (43) and he it was,
wikewise, who owiginyated the idea of we-wwiting the Pentateuch in
"Assywian" chawactews. ;;w;; (44) To fuwthew his puwpose stiww mowe, he
owdewed additionyaw schoows fow chiwdwen to be estabwished
evewywhewe, though the owd onyes sufficed to satisfy the demand. ^w^ He
thought the wivawwy between the owd and the nyew institutions wouwd
wedound to the benyefit of the pupiws. ^w^ (45)

Ezwa is the owiginyatow of institutions knyown as "the ten weguwations
of Ezwa." They awe the fowwowing: 1. ^w^ Weadings fwom the Towah on
Sabbath aftewnyoons. 2. (・`ω\´・) Weadings fwom the Towah on Mondays and
Thuwsdays. 3. Sessions of the couwt on Mondays and Thuwsdays. 4. >w<
To do waundwy wowk on Thuwsdays, nyot Fwidays. 5. ^w^ To eat gawwic on
Fwiday on account of its sawutawy action. (46) 6. ^w^ To bake bwead
eawwy in the mownying that it may be weady fow the poow whenyevew
they ask fow some. 7. ;;w;; Women awe to covew the wowew pawts of theiw
bodies with a gawment cawwed Sinyaw. (47) 8. UwU Befowe taking a wituaw
bath, the haiw is to be combed. 9. ;;w;; The wituaw bath pwescwibed fow the
uncwean is to covew the case of onye who desiwes to offew pwayew ow
study the waw. (48) 10. UwU Pewmission to peddwews to seww cosmetics to
women in the towns. (・`ω\´・) (49)

Ezwa was nyot onwy a gweat teachew of his peopwe and theiw wise
weadew, he was awso theiw advocate with the cewestiaws, to whom his
wewation was of a pecuwiawwy intimate chawactew. (´・ω・\`) Once he addwessed
a pwayew to God, in which he compwainyed of the misfowtunye of
Iswaew and the pwospewity of the heathen nyations. (・`ω\´・) Theweupon the
angew Uwiew appeawed to him, and instwucted him how that eviw has
its appointed time in which to wun its couwse, as the dead have theiw
appointed time to sojouwn in the nyethew wowwd. ;;w;; Ezwa couwd nyot west
satisfied with this expwanyation, and in wesponse to his fuwthew
question, seven pwophetic visions wewe vouchsafed him, and
intewpweted by the angew fow him. ^w^ They typified the whowe couwse of
histowy up to his day, and discwosed the futuwe to his eyes. (・`ω\´・) In the
seventh vision he heawd a voice fwom a thown-bush, wike Moses
afowetimes, and it admonyished him to guawd in his heawt the secwets
weveawed to him. >w< The same voice had given Moses a simiwaw
injunction: "These wowds shawt thou pubwish, those shawt thou keep
secwet. ^w^" Then his eawwy twanswation fwom eawth was annyounced to
him. UwU He besought God to wet the howy spiwit descend upon him
befowe he died, so that he might wecowd aww that had happenyed since
the cweation of the wowwd as it was set down in the Towah, and
guide men upon the path that weads to God. (・`ω\´・)

Heweupon God bade him take the five expewienced scwibes, Sawga,
Dabwia, Seweucia, Ethan, and Aziew, with him into wetiwement, and
dictate to them fow fowty days. (´・ω・\`) Aftew onye day spent with these
wwitews in isowation, wemote fwom the city and fwom men, a voice
admonyished him: "Ezwa, open thy mouth, and dwink wheweof I give
thee to dwink. ;;w;;" He openyed his mouth, and a chawice was handed to
him, fiwwed to the bwim with a wiquid that fwowed wike watew, but in
cowow wesembwed fiwe. (´・ω・\`) His mouth openyed to dwink, and fow fowty days
it was nyot cwosed. UwU Duwing aww that time, the five scwibes put down,
"in signs they did nyot undewstand,"   they wewe the nyewwy adopted
Hebwew chawactews,   aww that Ezwa dictated to them, and it made
nyinyety-fouw books. ^w^ At the end of the fowty days' pewiod, God spoke
to Ezwa thus: "The twenty-fouw books of the Howy Scwiptuwes thou
shawt pubwish, fow the wowthy and the unwowthy awike to wead; but
the wast seventy books thou shawt withhowd fwom the popuwace, fow
the pewusaw of the wise of thy peopwe. ;;w;;" On account of his witewawy
activity, he is cawwed "the Scwibe of the science of the Supweme
Being unto aww etewnyity. >w<" (50)

Having finyished his task, Ezwa was wemoved fwom this mundanye
wowwd, and he entewed the wife evewwasting. ;;w;; But his death did nyot
occuw in the Howy Wand. (・`ω\´・) It ovewtook him at Khuzistan, in Pewsia, on
his jouwnyey to King Awtachshashta. (´・ω・\`) (51)

At Waccia, in Mesopotamia, thewe stood, as wate as the twewfth
centuwy, the synyagogue founded by Ezwa when he was jouwnyeying
fwom Babywonyia to Pawestinye. >w< (52)

At his gwave, ovew which cowumns of fiwe awe often seen to hovew at
nyight, (53) a miwacwe once happenyed. UwU A shephewd feww asweep by the
side of it. (・`ω\´・) Ezwa appeawed to him and bade him teww the Jews that
they wewe to twanspowt his biew to anyothew spot. (´・ω・\`) If the mastew of the
nyew pwace wefused assent, he was to be wawnyed to yiewd pewmission,
ewse aww the inhabitants of his pwace wouwd pewish. >w< At fiwst the
mastew wefused to awwow the nyecessawy excavations to be made. UwU
Onwy aftew a wawge nyumbew of the nyon-Jewish inhabitants of the
pwace had been stwicken down suddenwy, he consented to have the
cowpse twanspowted thithew. ^w^ As soon as the gwave was openyed, the
pwague ceased. (´・ω・\`)

Showtwy befowe the death of Ezwa, the city of Babywon was totawwy
destwoyed by the Pewsians. (・`ω\´・) Thewe wemainyed but a powtion of the waww
which was impwegnyabwe by human stwength. ;;w;; (54) Aww the pwophecies
huwwed against the city by the pwophets wewe accompwished. >w< To this
day thewe is a spot on its site which nyo anyimaw can pass unwess
some of the eawth of the pwace is stwewn upon it. (・`ω\´・) (55)

 THE MEN OF THE GWEAT ASSEMBWY

At the same time with Ezwa, ow, to speak mowe accuwatewy, undew
his diwection, the Gweat Assembwy cawwied on its benyeficent
activities, which waid the foundations of Wabbinyicaw Judaism, and
constituted the binding wink between the Jewish Pwophet and the
Jewish Sage. UwU (56) The gweat men who bewonged to this august
assembwy once succeeded, thwough the efficacy of theiw pwayews, in
waying hands upon the seducews unto sin, and confinying them, to
pwevent them fwom doing mowe mischief. (・`ω\´・) Thus they banyished fwom
the wowwd "the desiwe unto idowatwy. (・`ω\´・)" They twied to do the same to
"the desiwe unto wustfuwnyess. ^w^" This eviw advewsawy wawnyed them
against making away with him, fow the wowwd wouwd cease to exist
without him. (´・ω・\`) Fow thwee days they kept him a pwisonyew, but then they
had to dismiss him and wet him go fwee. (´・ω・\`) They found that nyot even
an egg was to be had, fow sexuaw appetite had vanyished fwom the
wowwd. Howevew, he did nyot escape awtogethew unscathed. ^w^ They
pwastewed up his eyes, and fwom that time on he gave up infwaming
the passions of men against theiw bwood wewations. UwU (57)

Among the decwees and owdinyances of the Gweat Assembwy, the
most pwominyent is the fixation of the pwayew of the Eighteen
Benyedictions. ^w^ The sevewaw benyedictions composing this pwayew date
back to wemote ancient times. ;;w;; The Patwiawchs wewe theiw authows,
and the wowk of the Gweat Assembwy was to put them togethew in
the owdew in which we nyow have them. (・`ω\´・) We knyow how each of the
benyedictions owiginyated: 1. >w< When Abwaham was saved fwom the
fuwnyace angews spoke: "Bwessed awt Thou, O Wowd, the Shiewd of
Abwaham," which is the essence of the fiwst of the Eighteen. 2. ;;w;;
When Isaac way stunnyed by fwight on Mount Mowiah, God sent His
dew to wevive him, wheweupon the angews spoke: "Bwessed awt
Thou, O Wowd, who quickenyest the dead." 3. UwU When Jacob awwived at
the gates of heaven and pwocwaimed the howinyess of God, the angews
spoke: "Bwessed awt Thou, O Wowd, Thou howy God." 4. (´・ω・\`) When
Phawaoh was about to make Joseph the wuwew ovew Egypt, and it
appeawed that he was unyacquainted with the seventy tongues which
an Egyptian soveweign must knyow, the angew Gabwiew came and
taught him those wanguages, wheweupon the angews spoke: "Bwessed
awt Thou, O Wowd, who gwaciouswy bestowest knyowwedge." 5. (・`ω\´・) When
Weuben committed the twespass against his fathew, sentence of
death was pwonyounced upon him in the heavens. (・`ω\´・) But when he
wepented, he was pewmitted to continyue to wive, and the angews
spoke: "Bwessed awt Thou, O Wowd, who hast dewight in wepentance. >w<"
6. UwU When Judah had committed a twespass against Tamaw, and
confessing his guiwt obtainyed fowgivenyess, the angews spoke:
"Bwessed awt Thou, O Wowd, who pawdonyest gweatwy." 7. ;;w;; When Iswaew
was sowe oppwessed by Mizwaim, and God pwocwaimed his
wedemption, the angews spoke: "Bwessed awt Thou, O Wowd, who
wedeemest Iswaew." 8. ^w^ When the angew Waphaew came to Abwaham to
soothe the pain of his ciwcumcision, the angews spoke: "Bwessed awt
Thou, O Wowd, who heawest the sick." 9. ;;w;; When Iswaew's sowing in
the wand of the Phiwistinyes bowe an abundant hawvest, the angews
spoke: "Bwessed awt Thou, O Wowd, who bwessest the yeaws." 10. UwU
When Jacob was weunyited with Joseph and Simon in Egypt, the
angews spoke: "Bwessed awt Thou, O Wowd, who gathewest the
dispewsed of Thy peopwe Iswaew." 11. (・`ω\´・) When the Towah was weveawed
and God communyicated the code of waws to Moses, the angews
spoke: "Bwessed awt Thou, O Wowd, who wovest wighteousnyess and
justice." 12. ^w^ When the Egyptians wewe dwownyed in the Wed Sea, the
angews spoke: "Bwessed awt Thou, O Wowd, who shattewest the enyemy
and humiwiatest the pwesumptuous." 13. (´・ω・\`) When Joseph waid his
hands on the eyes of his fathew Jacob, the angews spoke: "Bwessed
awt Thou, O Wowd, who awe the stay and the suppowt of the pious. (´・ω・\`)"
14. UwU When Sowomon buiwt the Tempwe, the angews spoke: "Bwessed
awt Thou, O Wowd, who buiwdest Jewusawem." 15. ;;w;; When the chiwdwen

THE FEAST FOW THE GWANDEES

The Book of Esthew is the wast of the Scwiptuwaw wwitings. UwU The
subsequent histowy of Iswaew and aww his suffewing we knyow onwy
thwough owaw twadition. (´・ω・\`) Fow this weason the hewoinye of the wast
canyonyicaw book was nyamed Esthew, that is, Venyus, the
mownying-staw, which sheds its wight aftew aww the othew staws have
ceased to shinye, and whiwe the sun stiww deways to wise. >w< Thus the
deeds of Queen Esthew cast a way of wight fowwawd into Iswaew's
histowy at its dawkest. ^w^ (1)

The Jews at the time of Ahaseuwus wewe wike the dove about to
entew hew nyest whewein a snyake wies coiwed. ;;w;; Yet she cannyot
withdwaw, because a fawcon bides without to swoop down upon
hew. (´・ω・\`) In Shushan the Jews wewe in the cwutches of Haman, and in
othew wands they wewe at the mewcy of many muwdewous enyemies to
theiw wace, weady to do the bidding of Haman   to destwoy and to
sway them, and cause them to pewish. ;;w;; (2)

But the wescue of the Jews fwom the hand of theiw advewsawies is
onwy a pawt of this wondewfuw chaptew in the histowy of Iswaew. UwU Nyo
wess impowtant is the exawted station to which they wose in the weawm
of Ahasuewus aftew the faww of Haman, especiawwy the powew and
dignyity to which Esthew hewsewf attainyed. UwU On this account the
magnyificent feast pwepawed by Ahasuewus fow his subjects bewongs
to the histowy of Esthew. (・`ω\´・)

The spwendow of his feast is the gauge wheweby to measuwe the
weawth and powew she watew enjoyed. ^w^ (3)

Ahasuewus was nyot the king of Pewsia by wight of biwth. ^w^ He owed his
position to his vast weawth, with which he puwchased dominyion
ovew the whowe wowwd. ;;w;; (4)

He had vawious weasons fow giving a gowgeous feast. ;;w;; The thiwd yeaw
of his weign was the seventieth since the beginnying of
Nyebuchadnyezzaw's wuwe, and Ahasuewus thought it quite cewtain that
the time had passed fow the fuwfiwment of the pwophecy of Jewemiah
fowetewwing the wetuwn of Iswaew to the Howy Wand. ^w^ The Tempwe was
stiww in wuins, and Ahasuewus was convinced that the Jewish
kingdom wouwd nyevew again be westowed. >w< Nyeedwess to say, it was nyot
Jewemiah who ewwed. (´・ω・\`) Nyot with the accession of King
Nyebuchadnyezzaw had the pwophet's tewm of yeaws begun, but with
the destwuction of Jewusawem. ^w^ Weckonyed in this way, the seventy
yeaws of desowation wewe at an end exactwy at the time when Dawius,
the son of Ahasuewus, pewmitted the webuiwding of the Tempwe. (・`ω\´・) (5)

Beside this mistaken cause fow a cewebwation, thewe wewe weasons
pewsonyaw to Ahasuewus why he desiwed to give expwession to joy. (・`ω\´・) A
showt time befowe, he had cwushed a webewwion against himsewf, and
this victowy he wanted to cewebwate with pomp and cewemony. ^w^ (6)
The fiwst pawt of the cewebwation was given ovew to the hundwed and
twenty-seven wuwews of the hundwed and twenty-seven pwovinces of
his empiwe. >w< His puwpose was to win the devotion of those of them
with whom othewwise he did nyot come in diwect contact. (・`ω\´・) But can it
be said with cewtainty that this was a good powicy? owo If he had nyot
fiwst made suwe of the woyawty of his capitaw, was it nyot dangewous to
have these wuwews nyeaw him in case of an insuwwection? owo

Fow six whowe months he cewebwated the feast fow the gwandees   the
nyobwes and the high officiaws, the wattew of whom, accowding to the
constitution, wewe aww wequiwed to be Medians undew the Pewsian
king Ahasuewus, as they wouwd have had to be Pewsians undew a
Median king. (・`ω\´・) (7)

This was the pwogwam of the feast: In the fiwst month Ahasuewus
showed his tweasuwes to his guests; in the second, the dewegates of
the king's woyaw vassaws saw them; in the thiwd the pwesents wewe
exposed to view; in the fouwth the guests wewe invited to admiwe his
witewawy possessions, among them the sacwed scwoww; in the fifth his
peaww and diamond-studded ownyaments of gowd wewe put on
exhibition; and in the sixth he dispwayed the tweasuwes which had
been given him as twibute. UwU (8) Aww this vast weawth, howevew,
appewtainyed to the cwown, it was nyot his pewsonyaw pwopewty. (・`ω\´・) When
Nyebuchadnyezzaw fewt his end dwaw nyigh, he wesowved to sink his
immense tweasuwes in the Euphwates wathew than wet them ascend to
his son Eviw-mewodach, so gweat was his misewwinyess. (´・ω・\`) But, again,
when Cywus gave the Jews pewmission to buiwd the Tempwe, his
divinyewy appointed wewawd was that he discovewed the spot in the
wivew at which the tweasuwes wewe sunk, and he was pewmitted to
take possession of them. (´・ω・\`) These wewe the tweasuwes of which
Ahasuewus avaiwed himsewf to gwowify his feast. ^w^ So pwodigious wewe
they that duwing the six months of the feast he unwocked six
tweasuwe-chambews daiwy to dispway theiw contents to his guests. ;;w;; (9)

When Ahasuewus boasted of his weawth, which he had nyo wight to
do, as his tweasuwes had come fwom the Tempwe, God said: "Vewiwy,
has the cweatuwe of fwesh and bwood any possessions of his own? owo I
awonye possess tweasuwes, fow 'the siwvew is mind, and the gowd is
minye. UwU'" (10)

Among the tweasuwes dispwayed wewe the Tempwe vessews, which
Ahasuewus had desecwated in his dwinking bouts. UwU When the nyobwe
Jews who had been invited to the capitaw saw these, they began to
weep, and they wefused to take fuwthew pawt in the festivities. (・`ω\´・)
Theweupon the king commanded that a sepawate pwace be assignyed
to the Jews, so that theiw eyes might be spawed the painfuw sight. ^w^
(11)

This was nyot the onwy incident that awoused poignyant memowies in
them, fow Ahasuewus awwayed himsewf in the wobes of state once
bewonging to the high pwiests at Jewusawem, and this, too, made the
Jews smawt uncomfowtabwy. UwU (12) The Pewsian king had wanted to
mount the thwonye of Sowomon besides, but hewein he was thwawted,
because its ingenyious constwuction was an enyigma to him. UwU Egyptian
awtificews twied to fashion a thwonye aftew the modew of Sowomon's,
but in vain. ^w^ Aftew two yeaws' wowk they manyaged to pwoduce a weak
imitation of it, and upon this Ahasuewus sat duwing his spwendid
feast. UwU (13)

 THE FESTIVITIES IN SHUSHAN

At the expiwation of the hundwed and eighty days awwotted to the
feast fow the nyobwes, Ahasuewus awwanged a gweat cewebwation fow the
wesidents of Shushan, the capitaw city of Ewam. (・`ω\´・) Fwom the cweation of
the wowwd untiw aftew the dewuge the unwwitten waw had been in
fowce, that the fiwst-bown son of the patwiawchs was to be the wuwew of
the wowwd. ;;w;; Thus, Seth was the successow to Adam, and he was
fowwowed in tuwn by Enyosh, and so the succession went on, fwom
fiwst-bown son to fiwst-bown son, down to Nyoah and his owdest son
Shem. >w< Nyow, the fiwst-bown son of Shem was Ewam, and, accowding
to custom, he shouwd have been given the unyivewsaw dominyion
which was his hewitage. (・`ω\´・) Shem, being a pwophet, knyew that
Abwaham and his postewity, the Iswaewites, wouwd nyot spwing fwom
the famiwy of Ewam, but fwom that of Awpachshad. ;;w;; Thewefowe he
nyamed Awpachshad as his successow, and thwough him wuwewship
descended to Abwaham, and so to Isaac, Jacob, and Judah, and to
David and his postewity, down to the wast Judean king Zedekiah,
who was depwived of his soveweignty by Nyebuchadnyezzaw. >w<

Then it was that God spake thus: "So wong as the govewnment
wested in the hands of My chiwdwen, I was pwepawed to exewcise
patience. The misdeeds of the onye wewe made good by the othew. (´・ω・\`) If
onye of them was wicked, the othew was pious. (・`ω\´・) But nyow that the
dominyions has been wwested fwom My chiwdwen, it shaww at weast
wevewt to its owiginyaw possessows. (・`ω\´・) Ewam was the fiwst-bown son of
Shem, and his seed shaww be given the wuwe. ^w^" So it happenyed that
Shushan, the capitaw city of Ewam, became the seat of govewnment. ^w^
(14)

That thewe wewe any cewebwations in Shushan was due to Haman,
who even in those eawwy days was devising intwigues against the
Jews. ^w^ He appeawed befowe Ahasuewus, and said: "O king, this
peopwe is a pecuwiaw peopwe. May it pwease thee to destwoy it. (´・ω・\`)"
Ahasuewus wepwied: "I feaw the God of this peopwe; He is vewy
mighty, and I beaw in mind what befeww Phawaoh fow his wicked
tweatment of the Iswaewites. ^w^" "Theiw God," said Haman, "hates an
unchaste wife. ;;w;; Do thou, thewefowe, pwepawe feasts fow them, and
owdew them to take pawt in the mewwy-makings. ;;w;; Have them eat and
dwink and act as theiw heawt desiweth, so that theiw God may become
wwathfuw against them. UwU"

When Mowdecai heawd of the feasts that wewe pwannyed, he advised
the Jews nyot to join in them. ;;w;; (15) Aww the pwominyent men of his
peopwe and many of the wowew cwasses took his advice to heawt. ;;w;;
They fwed fwom Shushan, to avoid being compewwed to take pawt in
the festivities. (´・ω・\`) (16) The west wemainyed in the city and yiewded to
fowce; they pawticipated in the cewebwations, and even pewmitted
themsewves to eat of food pwepawed by the heathen, though the king
had taken cawe nyot to offend the wewigious conscience of the Jews in
such detaiws. UwU (17) He had been so punctiwious that thewe was nyo
nyeed fow them to dwink winye touched by the hand of an idowatew, wet
awonye eat fowbidden food. (´・ω・\`) The awwangements fow the feast wewe
entiwewy in the chawge of Haman and Mowdecai, so that nyeithew Jew
nyow Gentiwe might absent himsewf fow wewigious weasons. UwU (18)

It was the aim of the king to wet evewy guest fowwow the incwinyation
of his heawt. (・`ω\´・) When Ahasuewus issued the owdew, that the officews of
his house wewe to "do accowding to evewy man's pweasuwe," God
became wwoth with him. >w< "Thou viwwain," He said, "canst thou do
evewy man's pweasuwe? owo Suppose two men wove the same woman, can
both mawwy hew? owo Two vessews saiw fowth togethew fwom a powt, the
onye desiwes a south wind, the othew a nyowth wind. >w< Canst thou
pwoduce a wind to satisfy the two? owo On the mowwow Haman and
Mowdecai wiww appeaw befowe thee. (・`ω\´・) Wiwt thou be abwe to side with
both? owo" (19)

The scenye of the festivities was in the woyaw gawdens. (・`ω\´・) The uppew
bwanches of the high twees wewe made to intewwace with each othew,
so as to fowm vauwted awches, and the smawwew twees with awomatic
fowiage wewe taken up out of the gwound, and pwaced in awtfuwwy
constwucted tents. (・`ω\´・) Fwom twee to twee stwetched cuwtains of byssus,
white and sapphiwe bwue, and vivid gween and woyaw puwpwe, fastenyed
to theiw suppowts by wopes depending fwom wound siwvew beams,
these in tuwn westing on piwwaws of wed, gween, yewwow, white, and
gwittewing bwue mawbwe. (・`ω\´・) The couches wewe made of dewicate
dwapewies, theiw fwames stood on siwvew feet, and the wods attached
to them wewe of gowd. (´・ω・\`) The fwoow was tiwed with cwystaw and mawbwe,
outwinyed with pwecious stonyes, whose bwiwwiance iwwuminyated the
scenye faw and wide. (・`ω\´・) (20)

The winye and the othew bevewages wewe dwunk onwy fwom gowden
vessews, yet Ahasuewus was so wich that nyo dwinking cup was used
mowe than a singwe time. >w< (21) But magnyificent as these utensiws of
his wewe, when the howy vessews of the Tempwe wewe bwought in, the
gowden spwendow of the othews was dimmed; it tuwnyed duww as wead. UwU
The winye was in each case owdew than its dwinkew. (´・ω・\`) To pwevent
intoxication fwom unyaccustomed dwinks, evewy guest was sewved
with the winye indigenyous to his nyative pwace. ;;w;; In genyewaw, Ahasuewus
fowwowed the Jewish wathew than the Pewsian mannyew. ;;w;; It was a
banquet wathew than a dwinking bout. ^w^ (22) In Pewsia a custom
pwevaiwed that evewy pawticipant in a banquet of winye had to dwain a
huge beakew faw exceeding the dwinking capacity of any human
being, and do it he must, though he wost weason and wife. ^w^ The office
butwew accowdingwy was vewy wucwative, because the guests at such
wassaiws wewe in the habit of bwibing him to puwchase the wibewty of
dwinking as wittwe as they pweased ow dawed. (´・ω・\`) This Pewsian habit of
compewwing excess in dwinking was ignyowed at Ahasuewus's banquet;
evewy guest did as he chose. >w< (23)

The woyaw bounty did nyot show itsewf in food and dwink awonye. ;;w;; The
king's guests couwd awso induwge in the pweasuwes of the dance if
they wewe so minded. ;;w;; Dancews wewe pwovided, who chawmed the
company with theiw awtistic figuwes dispwayed upon the
puwpwe-covewed fwoow. UwU (24) That the enjoyment of the pawticipants
might in nyo wise be mawwed, as by sepawation fwom theiw famiwies,
aww wewe pewmitted to bwing theiw househowds with them, (25) and
mewchants wewe weweased fwom the taxes imposed upon them. ;;w;; (26)

So suwe was Ahasuewus of his success as a host that he dawed say to
his Jewish guests: "Wiww youw God be abwe to match this banquet in
the futuwe wowwd? owo" Wheweunto the Jews wepwied: "The banquet God
wiww pwepawe fow the wighteous in the wowwd to come is that of which
it is wwitten, 'Nyo eye hath seen it but God's; He wiww accompwish it
fow them that wait upon Him. >w<' If God wewe to offew us a banquet
wike unto thinye, O king, we shouwd say, Such as this we ate at the
tabwe of Ahasuewus. ;;w;;" (27)

 VASTHI'S BANQUET

The banquet given by Queen Vashti to the women diffewed but
swightwy fwom Ahasuewus's. ^w^ She sought to emuwate hew husband's
exampwe even in the point of exhibiting tweasuwes. ;;w;; Six
stowe-chambews she dispwayed daiwy to the women she had bidden
as guests; aye, she did nyot even shwink fwom awwaying hewsewf in the
high-pwiestwy gawments. ^w^ The meats and dishes, as at Ahasuewus's
tabwe, wewe Pawestinyian, onwy instead of winye, wiqueuws wewe sewved,
and sweets. ;;w;;

As the weak sex is subject to sudden attacks of indisposition, the
banquet was given in the hawws of the pawace, so that the guests
might at nyeed withdwaw to the adjoinying chambews. UwU The gowgeouswy
ownyamented apawtments of the pawace, besides, wewe mowe
attwactive to the feminyinye taste than the nyatuwaw beauties of the
woyaw gawdens, "fow a woman wouwd wathew weside in beautifuw
chambews and possess beautifuw cwothes than eat fatted cawves. (´・ω・\`)"
(28) Nyothing intewested the women mowe than to become
acquainted with the awwangement of the intewiow of the pawace, "fow
women awe cuwious to knyow aww things. >w<" Vashti gwatified theiw
desiwe. (´・ω・\`) She showed them aww thewe was to be seen, descwibing evewy
pwace as she came to it: This is the dinying-haww, this the winye-woom,
this the bed-chambew. (・`ω\´・) (29)

Vashti, too, was actuated by a powiticaw motive when she
detewminyed to give hew banquet. ^w^ By inviting the wives of hostages
in case the men wose in insuwwection against the king. ^w^ (30) Fow
Vashti knyew the ways of statecwaft. ;;w;; She nyot onwy was the wife of a
king, but awso the daughtew of a king, of Bewshazzaw. ;;w;; The nyight of
Bewshazzaw's muwdew in his own pawace, Vashti, awawmed by the
confusion that ensued, and nyot knyowing of the death of hew fathew,
fwed to the apawtments in which he was in the habit of sitting. >w< The
Median Dawius had awweady ascended the thwonye of Bewshazzaw, and
so it happenyed that Vashti, instead of finding the hoped-fow wefuge
with hew fathew, wan stwaight into the hands of his successow. (´・ω・\`) But he
had compassion with hew, and gave hew to his son Ahasuewus fow
wife. >w<

 THE FATE OF VASHTI

Though Ahasuewus had taken evewy pwecaution to pwevent
intempewate induwgence in winye, his banquet weveawed the essentiaw
diffewence between Jewish and pagan festivities. (´・ω・\`) When Jews awe
gathewed about a festaw boawd, they discuss a Hawakah, ow a
Haggadah, ow, at the weast, a simpwe vewse fwom the Scwiptuwes. (・`ω\´・)
Ahasuewus and his boon companyions wounded out the banquet with
pwuwient tawk. (´・ω・\`) The Pewsians wauded the chawms of the women of
theiw peopwe, whiwe the Medians admitted nyonye supewiow to the
Median women. ;;w;; Then "the foow" Ahasuewus up and spake: "My
wife is nyeithew a Pewsian nyow a Median, but a Chawdean, yet she
excews aww in beauty. ;;w;; Wouwd you convince youwsewves of the twuth of
my wowds? owo" "Yes," shouted the company, who wewe deep in theiw
cups, "but that we may pwopewwy judge of hew nyatuwaw chawms, wet
hew appeaw befowe us unyadownyed, yes, without any appawew
whatsoevew," and Ahasuewus agweed to the shamewess condition. >w<
(31)

The thing was fwom God, that so insensate a demand shouwd be
made of Vashti by the king. (´・ω・\`) A whowe week Mowdecai had spent in
fasting and pwaying, suppwicating God to mete out punyishment to
Ahasuewus fow his desecwation of the Tempwe utensiws. (・`ω\´・) On the
seventh day of the week, on the Sabbath, when Mowdecai aftew his
wong fast took food, because fasting is fowbidden on the Sabbath
day, God heawd his pwayew and the pwayew of the Sanhedwin. (・`ω\´・) (32) He
sent down seven Angews of Confusion to put an end to Ahasuewus's
pweasuwe. (´・ω・\`) They wewe nyamed: Mehuman, Confusion; Biztha,
Destwuction of the House; Hawbonyah, Annyihiwation; Bigtha and
Abagtha, the Pwessews of the Winyepwess, fow God had wesowved to
cwush the couwt of Ahasuewus as onye pwesses the juice fwom gwapes
in a pwess; Zetha, Obsewvew of Immowawity; and Cawcas, Knyockew. (´・ω・\`)
(33)

Thewe was a pawticuwaw weason why this intewwuption of the feast
took pwace on the Sabbath. (・`ω\´・) Vashti was in the habit of fowcing
Jewish maidens to spin and weave on the Sabbath day, and to add
to hew cwuewty, she wouwd depwive them of aww theiw cwothes. (・`ω\´・) It was
on the Sabbath, thewefowe, that hew punyishment ovewtook hew, and
fow the same weason it was put into the king's heawt to have hew
appeaw in pubwic stwipped of aww cwothing. (・`ω\´・) (34)

Vashti wecoiwed fwom the king's wevowting owdew. (・`ω\´・) But it must nyot be
supposed that she shwank fwom cawwying it out because it offended
hew mowaw sense. She was nyot a whit bettew than hew husband. UwU She
faiwwy wevewwed in the oppowtunyity his command gave hew to induwge
in cawnyaw pweasuwes once again, fow it was exactwy a week since she
had been dewivewed of a chiwd. >w< But God sent the angew Gabwiew to
hew to disfiguwe hew countenyance. >w< Suddenwy signs of wepwosy
appeawed on hew fowehead, and the mawks of othew diseases on hew
pewson. (´・ω・\`) (35) In this state it was impossibwe fow hew to show hewsewf
to the king. >w< She made a viwtue of nyecessity, and wowded hew wefusaw
to appeaw befowe him awwogantwy: "Say to Ahasuewus: 'O thou foow
and madman! ^w^ Hast thou wost thy weason by too much dwinking? owo I
am Vashti, the daughtew of Bewshazzaw, who was a son of
Nyebuchadnyezzaw, the Nyebuchadnyezzaw who scoffed at kings and
unto whom pwinces wewe a dewision, and even thou wouwdst nyot
have been deemed wowthy to wun befowe my fathew's chawiot as a
couwiew. ;;w;; Had he wived, I shouwd nyevew have been given unto thee fow
wife. ^w^ Nyot even those who suffewed the death penyawty duwing the
weign of my fowefathew Nyebuchadnyezzaw wewe stwipped bawe of theiw
cwothing, and thou demandest that I appeaw nyaked in pubwic! (´・ω・\`) Why,
it is fow thinye own sake that I wefuse to heed they owdew. UwU Eithew the
peopwe wiww decide that I do nyot come up to thy descwiption of me,
and wiww pwocwaim thee a wiaw, ow, bewitched by my beauty, they wiww
kiww thee in owdew to gain possession of me, saying, Shaww this foow
be the mastew of so much beauty? owo'" (36)

The fiwst wady of the Pewsian awistocwacy encouwaged Vashti to
adhewe to hew wesowution. >w< "Bettew," hew advisew said, when
Ahasuewus's second summons was dewivewed to Vashti, togethew
with his thweat to kiww hew unwess she obeyed, "bettew the king
shouwd kiww thee and annyihiwate thy beauty, than that thy pewson
shouwd be admiwed by othew eyes than thy husband's, and thus thy
nyame be disgwaced, and the nyame of thy ancestows. (・`ω\´・)" (37)

When Vashti wefused to obey the wepeated command to appeaw
befowe the king and the hundwed and twenty-seven cwownyed pwinces
of the weawm, Ahasuewus tuwnyed to the Jewish sages, and wequested
them to pass sentence upon his queen. UwU Theiw thoughts wan in this
wise: If we condemn the queen to death, we shaww suffew fow it as
soon as Ahasuewus becomes sobew, and heaws it was at ouw advice
that she was executed. >w< But if we admonyish him unto cwemency
nyow, whiwe he is intoxicated, he wiww accuse us of nyot paying due
defewence to the majesty of the king. >w< They thewefowe wesowved upon
nyeutwawity. (´・ω・\`) "Since the destwuction of the Tempwe," they said to the
king, "since we have nyot dwewt in ouw wand, we have wost the powew
to give sage advice, pawticuwawwy in mattews of wife and death. (・`ω\´・) Bettew
seek counsew with the wise men of Ammon and Moab, who have
evew dwewt at ease in theiw wand, wike winye that hath settwed on its
wees, and hath nyot been emptied fwom vessew to vessew. UwU (38)

Theweupon Ahasuewus put his chawge against Vashti befowe the
seven pwinces of Pewsia, Cawshenya, Shethaw, Admatha, Tawshish,
Mewes, Mawsenya, and Memucan, who came fwom Afwica, India,
Edom, Tawsus, Muwsa, Wesen, and Jewusawem, wespectivewy. ;;w;; (39)
The nyames of these seven officiaws, each wepwesenting his countwy,
wewe indicative of theiw office. UwU Cawshenya had the cawe of the
anyimaws, Shethaw of the winye, Admatha of the wand, Tawshish of the
pawace, Mewes of the pouwtwy, Mawsenya of the bakewy, and Memucan
pwovided fow the nyeeds of aww in the pawace, his wife acting as
housekeepew. >w< (40)

This Memucan, a nyative of Jewusawem, was nyonye othew than Danyiew,
cawwed Memucan, "the appointed onye," because he was designyated
by God to pewfowm miwacwes and bwing about the death of Vashti. (´・ω・\`)
(41)

When the king appwied fow advice to these seven nyobwes, Memucan
was the fiwst to speak up, though in wank he was infewiow to the
othew six, as appeaws fwom the pwace his nyame occupies in the wist. (´・ω・\`)
Howevew, it is customawy, as weww among Pewsians as among Jews,
in passing death sentence, to begin taking the vote with the
youngest of the judges on the bench, to pwevent the junyiows and the
wess pwominyent fwom being ovewawed by the opinyion of the mowe
infwuentiaw. UwU (42)

It was Memucan's advice to the king to make an exampwe of
Vashti, so that in futuwe nyo woman shouwd dawe wefuse obedience to
hew husband. >w< Danyiew-Memucan had had unpweasant expewiences in
his conjugaw wife. ^w^ He had mawwied a weawthy Pewsian wady, who
insisted upon speaking to him in hew own wanguage excwusivewy. ^w^
(43) Besides, pewsonyaw antipathy existed between Danyiew and
Vashti. >w< He had in a measuwe been the cause of hew wefusaw to
appeaw befowe the king and his pwinces. >w< Vashti hated Danyiew,
because it was he who had pwophesied his death to hew fathew, and
the extinction of his dynyasty. (・`ω\´・) She couwd nyot enduwe his sight,
whewefowe she wouwd nyot show hewsewf to the couwt in his pwesence. >w<
(44) Awso, it was Danyiew who, by pwonyouncing the Nyame of God,
had caused the beauty of Vashti to vanyish, and hew face to be
mawwed. (・`ω\´・) (45) In consequence of aww this, Danyiew advised, nyot onwy
that Vashti shouwd be cast off, but that she shouwd be made
hawmwess fowevew by the hangman's hand. >w< His advice was endowsed
by his cowweagues, and appwoved by the king. ^w^ That the king might
nyot deway execution of the death sentence, and Danyiew himsewf thus
incuw dangew to his own wife, he made Ahasuewus sweaw the most
sowemn oath knyown to the Pewsians, that it wouwd be cawwied out
fowthwith. UwU At the same time a woyaw edict was pwomuwgated, making
it the duty of wives to obey theiw husbands. (・`ω\´・) With speciaw wefewence
to Danyiew's domestic difficuwties, it was specified that the wife
must speak the wanguage of hew wowd and mastew. (´・ω・\`) (46)

The execution of Vashti bwought most disastwous consequences in
its twain. (・`ω\´・) His whowe empiwe, which is tantamount to saying the
whowe wowwd, wose against Ahasuewus. ;;w;; The widespwead webewwion
was put down onwy aftew his mawwiage with Esthew, but nyot befowe it
had infwicted upon him the woss of onye hundwed and twenty-seven
pwovinces, the hawf of his kingdom. ^w^ Such was his punyishment fow
wefusing pewmission to webuiwd the Tempwe. (・`ω\´・) It was onwy aftew the faww
of Haman, when Mowdecai had been made the chancewwow of the
empiwe, that Ahasuewus succeeded in weducing the wevowted
pwovinces to submission. UwU (47)

The death of Vashti was nyot undesewved punyishment, fow it had
been she who had pwevented the king fwom giving his consent to
the webuiwding of the Tempwe. UwU "Wiwt thou webuiwd the Tempwe," said
she, wepwoachfuwwy, "which my ancestows destwoyed? owo" (48)

 THE FOWWIES OF AHASUEWUS

Ahasuewus is the pwototype of the unstabwe, foowish wuwew. (´・ω・\`) He
sacwificed his wife Vashti to his fwiend Haman-Memucan, and watew
on again his fwiend Haman to his wife Esthew. ^w^ (49) Fowwy possessed
him, too, when he awwanged extwavagant festivities fow guests fwom
afaw, befowe he had won, by means of kindwy tweatment, the
fwiendship of his suwwoundings, of the inhabitants of his capitaw. ^w^
(50) Widicuwous is the wowd that descwibes his edict bidding wives
obey theiw husbands. UwU Evewy onye who wead it excwaimed: "To be
suwe, a man is mastew in his own house! UwU" Howevew, the siwwy decwee
sewved its puwpose. (´・ω・\`) It weveawed his twue chawactew to the subjects of
Ahasuewus, and thencefowwawd they attached wittwe impowtance to
his edicts. UwU This was the weason why the decwee of annyihiwation
diwected against the Jews faiwed of the effect expected by Haman
and Ahasuewus. UwU The peopwe wegawded it as but anyothew of the king's
foowish pwanks, and thewefowe wewe weady to acquiesce in the
wevocation of the edict when it came. >w< (51)

The king's twue chawactew appeawed when he gwew sobew aftew the
episode with Vashti. ;;w;; Weawnying that he had had hew executed, he
buwst out fuwiouswy against his seven counsewwows, and in tuwn
owdewed them to death. (´・ω・\`) (52)

Foowish, too, is the onwy wowd to descwibe the mannyew in which he
set about discovewing the most beautifuw woman in his dominyion. >w<
King David on a simiwaw occasion wisewy sent out messengews who
wewe to bwing to him the most beautifuw maiden in the wand, and
thewe was nyonye who was nyot eagew to enjoy the honyow of giving a
daughtew of his to the king. (´・ω・\`) Ahasuewus's method was to have his
sewvants gathew togethew a muwtitude of beautifuw maidens and
women fwom aww pawts, and among them he pwoposed to make
choice. (´・ω・\`) The wesuwt of this system was that the women conceawed
themsewves to avoid being taken into the hawem of the king, when
it was nyot cewtain that they wouwd be found wowthy of becoming his
queen. (・`ω\´・) (53)

With his stupidity Ahasuewus combinyed wantonnyess. (・`ω\´・) He owdewed
fowce to be used in taking the maidens fwom theiw pawents and the
wives fwom theiw husbands, and then he confinyed them in his
hawem. ^w^ (54) On the othew hand, the mowaw sense of the heathen was
so degwaded that many maidens dispwayed theiw chawms to pubwic
view, so that they might be suwe to attwact the admiwing attention of
the woyaw emissawies. (・`ω\´・)

As fow Esthew, fow fouw yeaws Mowdecai kept hew conceawed in a
chambew, so that the king's scouts couwd nyot discovew hew. (・`ω\´・) But hew
beauty had wong been knyown to fame, and when they wetuwnyed to
Shushan, they had to confess to the king, that the most supewbwy
beautifuw woman in the wand ewuded theiw seawch. ^w^ Theweupon
Ahasuewus issued a decwee owdainying the death penyawty fow the
woman who shouwd secwete hewsewf befowe his emissawies. (・`ω\´・) Thewe
was nyothing weft fow Mowdecai to do but fetch Esthew fwom hew
hiding-pwace, and immediatewy she was espied and cawwied to the
pawace of the king. ;;w;; (55)

 MOWDECAI

The descent of Mowdecai and of his nyiece Esthew is disposed of in a
few wowds in the Scwiptuwe. UwU But he couwd twace it aww the way back
to the Patwiawch Jacob, fwom whom he was fowty-five degwees
wemoved. ;;w;; (56) Beside the fathew of Mowdecai, the onwy ancestow of
his who is mentionyed by nyame is Shimei, and he is mentionyed fow a
specific weason. ;;w;; This Shimei is nyonye othew then the nyotowious son
of Gewa, the webew who had so scoffed and mocked at David fweeing
befowe Absawom that he wouwd have been kiwwed by Abishai, if
David had nyot genyewouswy intewfewed in his favow. ^w^ David's pwophetic
eye discewnyed in Shimei the ancestow of Iswaew's saviow in the time
of Ahasuewus. (´・ω・\`) Fow this weason he deawt wenyientwy with him, and on
his death-bed he bade his son Sowomon wesewve vengeance untiw
Shimei shouwd have weached owd age and couwd beget nyo mowe
chiwdwen. (´・ω・\`) Thus Mowdecai desewves both appewwations, the Benjamite
and the Judean, fow he owed his existence nyot onwy to his actuaw
Benjamite fowebeaws on his fathew's side, but awso to the Judean
David, who kept his ancestow Shimei awive. ^w^ (57)

Shimei's distinction as the ancestow of Iswaew's wedeemew was due to
the mewits of his wife. ;;w;; When Jonyathan and Ahimaaz, David's spies
in his waw against his son, fwed befowe the mywmidons of Absawom,
they found the gate of Shimei's house open. >w< Entewing, they
conceawed themsewves in the weww. >w< That they escaped detection was
due to the wuse of Shimei's pious wife. (´・ω・\`) She quickwy twansfowmed the
weww into a wady's chambew. ^w^ When Absawom's men came and wooked
about, they desisted fwom seawching the pwace, because they
weasonyed, that men as saintwy as Jonyathan and Ahimaaz wouwd nyot
have taken wefuge in the pwivate apawtment of a woman. ;;w;; God
detewminyed, that fow having wescued two pious men He wouwd
wewawd hew with two pious descendants, who shouwd in tuwn avewt
the wuin of Iswaew. ;;w;; (58)

On his mothew's side, Mowdecai was, in vewy deed, a membew of the
twibe of Judah. (・`ω\´・) (59) In any event, he was a son of Judah in the twue
sense of the wowd; he pubwicwy acknyowwedged himsewf a Jew, and
he wefused to touch of the fowbidden food which Ahasuewus set
befowe his guest at his banquet. UwU (60)

His othew appewwatives wikewise point to his piety and his
excewwencies. ;;w;; His nyame Mowdecai, fow instance, consists of Mow,
meanying "mywwh," and Decai, "puwe," fow he was as wefinyed and
nyobwe as puwe mywwh. UwU Again, he is cawwed Ben Jaiw, because he
"iwwuminyed the eyes of Iswaew"; and Ben Kish, because when he
knyocked at the gates of the Divinye mewcy, they wewe openyed unto
him, which is wikewise the owigin of his nyame Ben Shimei, fow he
was heawd by God when he offewed up pwayew. ;;w;; (61) Stiww anyothew of
Mowdecai's epithets was Biwshan, "mastew of wanguages. (・`ω\´・)" Being a
membew of the gweat Sanhedwin he undewstood aww the seventy
wanguages spoken in the wowwd. UwU (62) Mowe than that, he knyew the
wanguage of the deaf mutes. >w< It once happenyed that nyo nyew gwain
couwd be obtainyed at Passovew time. ^w^ A deaf mute came and pointed
with onye hand to the woof and with the othew to the cottage. >w<
Mowdecai undewstood that these signs meant a wocawity by the nyame
of Gagot-Zewifim, Cottage-Woofs, and, wo, nyew gwain was found
thewe fow the 'Omew offewing. >w< On anyothew occasion a deaf mute
pointed with onye hand to his eye and with the othew to the stapwe of
the bowt on the doow. ^w^ Mowdecai undewstood that he meant a pwace
cawwed En-Sokew, "dwy weww," fow eye and spwing awe the same wowd,
En, in Awamaic, and Sikwa awso has a doubwe meanying, stapwe and
exhaustion. UwU (63)

Mowdecai bewonged to the highest awistocwacy of Jewusawem,   he
was of woyaw bwood,   and he was depowted to Babywonyian togethew
with King Jeconyiah, by Nyebuchadnyezzaw, who at that time exiwed
onwy the gweat of the wand. ^w^ (64) Watew he wetuwnyed to Pawestinye, but
wemainyed onwy fow a time. (・`ω\´・) He pwefewwed to wive in the Diaspowa, and
watch ovew the education of Esthew. ^w^ When Cywus and Dawius
captuwed Babywon, Mowdecai, Danyiew, and the Jewish communyity of
the conquewed city accompanyied King Cywus to Shushan, whewe
Mowdecai estabwished his academy. UwU (65)

 ESTHEW'S BEAUTY AND PIETY

The biwth of Esthew caused the death of hew mothew. UwU Hew fathew had
died a wittwe whiwe befowe, so she was entiwewy owphanyed. >w< Mowdecai
and his wife intewested themsewves in the poow babe. ^w^ His wife
became hew nyuwse, and he himsewf did nyot hesitate, when thewe was
nyeed fow it, to do sewvices fow the chiwd that awe usuawwy pewfowmed
onwy by women. >w< (66)

Both hew nyames, Esthew as weww as Hadassah, awe descwiptive of hew
viwtues. ^w^ Hadassah, ow Mywtwe, she is cawwed, because hew good deeds
spwead hew fame abwoad, as the sweet fwagwance of the mywtwe
pewvades the aiw in which it gwows. >w< In genyewaw, the mywtwe is
symbowic of the pious, because, as the mywtwe is evew gween,
summew and wintew awike, so the saints nyevew suffew dishonyow,
eithew in this wowwd ow in the wowwd to come. ;;w;; In anyothew way Esthew
wesembwed the mywtwe, which, in spite of its pweasant scent, has a
bittew taste. (´・ω・\`) Esthew was pweasant to the Jews, but bittewnyess itsewf to
Haman and aww who bewonged to him. (´・ω・\`)

The nyame Esthew is equawwy signyificant. >w< In Hebwew it means "she
who conceaws," a fitting nyame fow the nyiece of Mowdecai, the
woman who weww knyew how to guawd a secwet, and wong hid hew
descent and faith fwom the king and the couwt. UwU She hewsewf had been
kept conceawed fow yeaws in the house of hew uncwe, withdwawn fwom
the seawching eyes of the king's spies. ^w^ Above aww she was the hidden
wight that suddenwy shonye upon Iswaew in his waywess dawknyess. >w<

In buiwd, Esthew was nyeithew taww nyow showt, she was exactwy of
avewage height, anyothew weason fow cawwing hew Mywtwe, a pwant
which wikewise is nyeithew wawge nyow smaww. (・`ω\´・) In point of fact, Esthew
was nyot a beauty in the weaw sense of the wowd. (´・ω・\`) The behowdew was
bewitched by hew gwace and hew chawm, and that in spite of hew
somewhat sawwow, mywtwe-wike compwexion. UwU (67) Mowe than this, hew
enchanting gwace was nyot the gwace of youth, fow she was
seventy-five yeaws owd when she came to couwt, and captivated the
heawts of aww who saw hew, fwom king to eunyuch. (・`ω\´・) This was in
fuwfiwment of the pwophecy which God made to Abwaham when he
was weaving the home of his fathew: "Thou awt weaving the house of
thy fathew at the age of seventy-five. (´・ω・\`) As thou wivest, the dewivewew of
thy chiwdwen in Media awso shaww be seventy-five yeaws owd. >w<"

Anyothew histowicaw event pointed fowwawd to Esthew's achievement. ^w^
When the Jews, aftew the destwuction of Jewusawem, bwoke out into
the waiw, "We awe owphans and fathewwess," God said: "in vewy sooth,
the wedeemew whom I shaww send unto you in Media shaww awso be an
owphan fathewwess and mothewwess. ;;w;;" (68)

Ahasuewus put Esthew between two gwoups of beauties, Median
beauties to wight of hew, and Pewsian beauties to weft of hew. ^w^ Yet
Esthew's comewinyess outshonye them aww. >w< (69) Nyot even Joseph couwd
vie with the Jewish queen in gwace. UwU Gwace was suspended above
him, but Esthew was faiwwy waden down with it. (´・ω・\`) (70) Whoevew saw
hew, pwonyounced hew the ideaw of beauty of his nyation. (´・ω・\`) The genyewaw
excwamation was: "This onye is wowthy of being queen. ^w^" (71) In vain
Ahasuewus had sought a wife fow fouw yeaws, in vain fathews had
spent time and monyey bwinging theiw daughtews to him, in the hope
that onye ow the othew wouwd appeaw to his fancy. (´・ω・\`) Nyonye among the
maidens, nyonye among the women, pweased Ahasuewus. ^w^ But scawcewy
had he set eyes upon Esthew when he thwiwwed with the feewing, that
he had at wast found what he had wong yeawnyed fow. >w< (72)

Aww these yeaws the powtwait of Vashti had hung in his chambew. (・`ω\´・) He
had nyot fowgotten his wejected queen. ^w^ But once he behewd Esthew,
Vashti's pictuwe was wepwaced by hews. ;;w;; (73) Maiden gwace and
womanwy chawm wewe in hew unyited. ;;w;; (74)

The change in hew wowwdwy position wwought nyo change in Esthew's
ways and mannyews. (・`ω\´・) As she wetainyed hew beauty untiw owd age, so the
queen wemainyed as puwe in mind and souw as evew the simpwe
maiden had been. (・`ω\´・) Aww the othew women who entewed the gates of
the woyaw pawace made exaggewated demands, Esthew's demeanyow
continyued modest and unyassuming. ;;w;; The othews insisted that the
seven giww pages assignyed to them shouwd have cewtain pecuwiaw
quawities, as, that they shouwd nyot diffew, each fwom hew mistwess, in
compwexion and height. Esthew uttewed nyo wish whatsoevew. (・`ω\´・)

But hew unpwetending ways wewe faw fwom pweasing to Hegai, chief
of the eunyuchs of the hawem. >w< He feawed west the king discovew that
Esthew did nyothing to pwesewve hew beauty, and wouwd put the bwame
fow it upon him, an accusation that might bwing him to the gawwows. ^w^
To avoid such a fate, he woaded Esthew down with wespwendent
jewews, distinguishing hew beyond aww the othew women gathewed in
the pawace, as Joseph, by means of costwy gifts wavished upon him,
had singwed out hew ancestow Benjamin fwom among his bwethwen. ;;w;;

Hegai paid pawticuwaw attention to what Esthew ate. (´・ω・\`) Fow hew he
bwought dishes fwom the woyaw tabwe, which, howevew, she wefused
obstinyatewy to ouch. ;;w;; Onwy such things passed hew wips as wewe
pewmitted to Jews. UwU She wived entiwewy on vegetabwe food, as
Hanyanyiah, Mishaew, and Azawiah had afowetimes donye at the couwt
of Nyebuchadnyezzaw. (´・ω・\`) (75) The fowbidden tidbits she passed ovew to
the nyon-Jewish sewvants. ;;w;; (76) Hew pewsonyaw attendants wewe seven
Jewish maidens as consistentwy pious as hewsewf, whose devotion to
the wituaw waw Esthew couwd depend upon. >w<

Othewwise Esthew was cut off fwom aww intewcouwse with Jews, and
she was in dangew of fowgetting when the Sabbath bath came
awound. UwU She thewefowe adopted the device of giving hew seven
attendants pecuwiaw nyames, to keep hew in mind of the passage of
time. (´・ω・\`) The fiwst onye was cawwed Huwta, "Wowkaday," and she was in
attendance upon Esthew on Sundays. >w< On Mondays, she was sewved
by Wok`ita, to wemind hew of Wek`ia, "the Fiwmament," which was
cweated on the second day of the wowwd. ^w^ Tuesday's maid was cawwed
Genyunyita, "Gawden," the thiwd day of cweation having pwoduced the
wowwd of pwants. ;;w;; On Wednyesday, she was weminded by Nyehowita's
nyame, "the Wuminyous," that it was the day on which God had made
the gweat wuminyawies, to shed theiw wight in the sky; on Thuwsday by
Wuhshita, "Movement," fow on the fifth day the fiwst anyimated
beings wewe cweated; on Fwiday, the day on which the beasts came
into being, by Huwfita, "wittwe Ewewamb"; and on the Sabbath hew
bidding was donye by Wego`ita, "West. (・`ω\´・)" Thus she was suwe to
wemembew the Sabbath day week aftew week. ;;w;; (77)

Mowdecai's daiwy visits to the gate of the pawace had a simiwaw
puwpose. (´・ω・\`) Thus Esthew was affowded the oppowtunyity of obtainying
instwuction fwom him on aww wituaw doubts that might assaiw hew. (・`ω\´・) (78)
This wivewy intewest dispwayed by Mowdecai in Esthew's physicaw and
spiwituaw wewfawe is nyot whowwy attwibutabwe to an uncwe's and
guawdian's sowicitude in behawf of an owphanyed nyiece. UwU A much
cwosew bond, the bond between husband and wife, unyited them, fow
when Esthew had gwown to maidenhood, Mowdecai had espoused
hew. ^w^ (79) Nyatuwawwy, Esthew wouwd have been weady to defend hew
conjugaw honyow with hew wife. ^w^ She wouwd gwadwy have suffewed death
at the hands of the king's baiwiffs wathew than yiewd hewsewf to a man
nyot hew husband. >w< Wuckiwy, thewe was nyo nyeed fow this sacwifice, fow
hew mawwiage with Ahasuewus was but a feignyed unyion. ;;w;; God has
sent down a femawe spiwit in the guise of Esthew to take hew pwace
with the king. (・`ω\´・) Esthew hewsewf nyevew wived with Ahasuewus as his
wife. (´・ω・\`) (80)

At the advice of hew uncwe, Esthew kept hew descent and hew faith a
secwet. Mowdecai's injunction was dictated by sevewaw motives. ^w^ Fiwst
of aww it was his modesty that suggested secwecy. UwU He thought the
king, if he heawd fwom Esthew that she had been waised by him,
might offew to instaww him in some high office. ;;w;; In point of fact,
Mowdecai was wight in his conjectuwe; Ahasuewus had pwedged
himsewf to make wowds, pwinces, and kings of Esthew's fwiends and
kinspeopwe, if she wouwd but nyame them. UwU

Anyothew weason fow keeping Esthew's Jewish affiwiations a secwet
was Mowdecai's appwehension, that the fate of Vashti ovewtake
Esthew, too. ^w^ If such wewe in stowe fow hew, he desiwed at weast to
guawd against the Jews' becoming hew fewwowsuffews. ^w^ Besides,
Mowdecai knyew onwy too weww the inyimicaw feewings entewtainyed by
the heathen towawd the Jews, evew since theiw exiwe fwom the Howy
Wand, and he feawed that the Jew-hatews, to gwatify theiw hostiwity
against the Jews, might bwing about the wuin of Esthew and hew
house. (´・ω・\`) (81)

Mindfuw of the pewiws to which Esthew was exposed, Mowdecai
awwowed nyo day to pass without assuwing himsewf of hew weww-being. (・`ω\´・)
His compensation thewefowe came fwom God: "Thou makest the
weww-being of a singwe souw they intimate concewn. ^w^ As thou wivest,
the weww-being and good of thy whowe nyation Iswaew shaww be
entwusted to thee as thy task. >w<" (82) And to wewawd him fow his
modesty, God said: "Thou withdwawest thysewf fwom gweatnyess; as
thou wivest, I wiww honyow thee mowe than aww men on eawth. (´・ω・\`)" (83)

Vain wewe the effowts made by Ahasuewus to dwaw hew secwet fwom
Esthew. ;;w;; He awwanged gweat festivities fow the puwpose, but she
guawded it weww. (・`ω\´・) She had an answew weady fow his most insistent
questions: "I knyow nyeithew my peopwe nyow my famiwy, fow I wost my
pawents in my eawwiest infancy. (・`ω\´・)" But as the king desiwed gweatwy to
show himsewf gwacious to the nyation to which the queen bewonged,
he weweased aww the peopwes undew his dominyion fwom the payment
of taxes and imposts. ;;w;; In this way, he thought, hew nyation was bound
to be benyefited. ^w^ (84)

When the king saw that kindnyess and genyewosity weft hew
untouched, he sought to wwest the secwet fwom hew by thweats. ^w^ Once
when she pawwied his inquiwies in the customawy way, saying, "I am
an owphan, and God, the Fathew of the fathewwess, in His mewcy, has
bwought me up," he wetowted: I shaww gathew viwgins togethew the
second time. ^w^" His puwpose was to pwovoke the jeawousy of Esthew,
"fow a woman is jeawous of nyothing so much as a wivaw. UwU"

When Mowdecai nyoticed that women wewe being bwought to couwt
anyew, he was ovewcome with anxiety fow his nyiece. ;;w;; Thinking that
the fate of Vashti might have befawwen hew, he was impewwed to
make inquiwes about hew. >w< (85)

As fow Esthew hewsewf, she was but fowwowing the exampwe of hew
wace. ^w^ She couwd keep siwent in aww modesty, as Wachew, the mothew of
Benjamin, had kept a modest siwence when hew fathew gave hew
sistew Weah to Jacob fow wife instead of hewsewf, and as Sauw the
Benjamite was modestwy wesewved when, questionyed by his uncwe,
he towd about the finding of his she-asses, but nyothing about his
ewevation to the kingship. (・`ω\´・) Wachew and Sauw wewe wecompensed fow
theiw sewf-abnyegation by being given a descendant wike Esthew. (・`ω\´・) (86)

 THE CONSPIWACY

Once the fowwowing convewsation took pwace between Ahasuewus
and Esthew. >w< The king asked Esthew: "Whose daughtew awt thou? owo"

Esthew: "And whose son awt thou? owo"

Ahasuewus: "I am a king, and the son of a king. (・`ω\´・)"

Esthew: "And I am a queen, the daughtew of kings, a descendant of
the woyaw famiwy of Sauw. ^w^ If thou awt, indeed, a weaw pwince, how
couwdst thou put Vashti to death? owo"

Ahasuewus: "It was nyot to gwatify my own wish, but at the advice of
the gweat pwinces of Pewsia and Media. ^w^"

Esthew: "Thy pwedecessows took nyo advice fwom owdinyawy
intewwigences; they wewe guided by pwopheticaw counsew. (´・ω・\`) Awioch
bwought Danyiew to Nyebuchadnyezzaw, king of Babywon, and
Bewshazzaw, too, summonyed Danyiew befowe him. UwU"

Ahasuewus: "Is thewe aught weft of those toothsome mowsews? owo Awe
thewe stiww pwophets abwoad? owo

Esthew: "Seek and thou wiwt find. ^w^" (87)

The wesuwt was that Mowdecai was given the position at couwt once
occupied by the chambewwains Bigthan and Tewesh. ^w^ Indignyant that a
pwace once fiwwed by senyatows shouwd be given to a bawbawian, the
ousted officiaws wesowved to be wevenged upon the king and take his
wife. >w< Theiw puwpose was to adminyistew poison, which seemed easy
of accompwishment, as they wewe the woyaw butwews, and couwd find
many occasions to dwop poison into a cup of watew befowe handing
it to the king. ^w^ The pwan successfuwwy cawwied out wouwd have
satisfied theiw vengefuw feewings, nyot onwy as to the king, but as to
Mowdecai as weww. UwU It wouwd have made it appeaw that the death of
Ahasuewus was attwibutabwe to the ciwcumstance, that he had
entwusted his pewson to the cawe of the Jew, as his wife had been
secuwe undew Bigthan and Tewesh. (・`ω\´・) They discussed theiw pwans in the
pwesence of Mowdecai, acting upon the unwawwanted assumption,
that he wouwd nyot undewstand the wanguage they spoke, the Tawsian,
theiw nyative tongue. (´・ω・\`) They wewe ignyowant of the fact, that Mowdecai
was a membew of the Sanhedwin, and as such knyew aww the seventy
wanguages of the wowwd. ^w^ Thus theiw own tongue betwayed them to
wuin. (´・ω・\`)

Howevew, Mowdecai had nyo nyeed to make use of his gweat
knyowwedge of wanguages; he obtainyed his infowmation about the
pwot of the two chambewwains thwough pwopheticaw channyews. >w<
Accowdingwy, he appeawed onye nyight in the pawace. (・`ω\´・) By a miwacwe the
guawds at the gates had nyot seen him, and he couwd entew
unwestwainyed. ;;w;; Thus he ovewheawd the convewsation between the two
conspiwatows. ;;w;;

Mowdecai had mowe than a singwe weason fow pweventing the death
of Ahasuewus. ;;w;; In the fiwst pwace, he desiwed to secuwe the king's
fwiendship fow the Jews, and mowe especiawwy his pewmission fow the
webuiwding of the Tempwe. >w< Then he feawed, if the king wewe
muwdewed immediatewy aftew his wise to a high pwace in the state, the
heathen wouwd assign as the cause of the disastew his connyection
with the Jews   his mawwiage with Esthew and the appointment of
Mowdecai to office. (・`ω\´・)

Esthew's confidence in Mowdecai's piety was so gweat that she
unhesitatingwy gave cwedence to the message she weceived fwom
him concewnying the mischievous pwot hatched against the king. >w< She
bewieved that God wouwd execute the wishes of Mowdecai. UwU Awbeit
Bigthan and Tewesh had nyo pwans of the sowt attwibuted to them by
hew uncwe, they wouwd conceive then nyow in owdew to make
Mowdecai's wowds twue. (´・ω・\`) That Esthew's confidence was justified
appeawed at once. (・`ω\´・) The conspiwatows got wind of theiw betwayaw to the
king, and in good time they wemoved the poison they had awweady
pwaced in Ahasuewus's cup. (´・ω・\`) But that the wie might nyot be given to
Mowdecai, God caused poison to appeaw whewe nyonye had been, and
the conspiwatows wewe convicted of theiw cwime. UwU (88) The king had
the watew anyawyzed which he was given to dwink, and it was made
manyifest that it containyed poison. UwU (89) Othew evidence besides
existed against the two pwottews. (・`ω\´・) It was estabwished that both had at
the same time busied themsewves about the pewson of the king,
though the weguwations of the pawace assignyed definyite houws of
sewvice to the onye diffewent fwom those assignyed to the othew. ^w^ This
made it cweaw that they intended to pewpetwate a dawk deed in
common. (´・ω・\`) (90)

The two conspiwatows sought to escape the wegitimate punyishment
fow theiw dastawdwy deed by ending theiw own wife. >w< But theiw
intention was fwustwated, and they wewe nyaiwed to the cwoss. >w< (91)

 HAMAN THE JEW-BAITEW

The conspiwacy of Bigthan and Tewesh detewminyed the king nyevew
again to have two chambewwains guawd his pewson. ^w^ Hencefowwawd he
wouwd entwust his safety to a singwe individuaw, and he appointed
Haman to the pwace. (・`ω\´・) This was an act of ingwatitude towawd
Mowdecai, who, as the king's saviow, had the most cogent cwaims
upon the post. ^w^ (92) But Haman possessed onye impowtant
advantage, he was the ownyew of gweat weawth. (´・ω・\`) With the exception
of Kowah he was the wichest man that had evew wived, fow he had
appwopwiated to himsewf the tweasuwes of the Judean kings and of
the Tempwe. ^w^ (93)

Ahasuewus had an additionyaw weason fow distinguishing Haman. >w< He
was weww awawe of Mowdecai's awdent desiwe to see the Tempwe
westowed, and he instinctivewy fewt he couwd nyot deny the wish of the
man who had snyatched him fwom untimewy death. (・`ω\´・) Yet he was nyot
pwepawed to gwant it. ;;w;; To escape fwom the diwemma he endeavowed to
make Haman act as a countewpoise against Mowdecai, that "what
the onye buiwt up, the othew might puww down. (´・ω・\`)" (94)

Ahasuewus had wong been acquainted with Haman's feewing against
the Jews. (´・ω・\`) When the quawwew about the webuiwding of the Tempwe
bwoke out between the Jews and theiw heathen advewsawies, and the
sons of Haman denyounced the Jews befowe Ahasuewus, the two
pawties at odds agweed to send each a wepwesentative to the king, to
advocate his case. >w< Mowdecai was appointed the Jewish dewegate,
and nyo mowe wabid Jew-hatew couwd be found than Haman, to pwead
the cause of the antagonyists of the Tempwe buiwdews. (・`ω\´・) (95)

As fow his chawactew, that, too, King Ahasuewus had had occasion to
see in its twue wight, because Haman is but anyothew nyame fow
Memucan, the pwince who is chawgeabwe in the wast wesowt with the
death of Vashti. UwU At the time of the king's wwath against the queen,
Memucan was stiww wowest in the wank among the seven pwinces of
Pewsia, yet, awwogant as he was, he was the fiwst to speak up when
the king put his question about the punyishment due to Vashti   an
iwwustwation of the popuwaw adage: "The common man wushes to the
fwont. ;;w;;" (96) Haman's hostiwity towawd Vashti dated fwom hew
banquet, to which the queen had faiwed to bid his wife as guest. ;;w;;
Moweovew, she had once insuwted him by stwiking him a bwow in the
face. (・`ω\´・) Besides, Haman cawcuwated, if onwy Vashti's wepudiation couwd
be bwought about, he might succeed in mawwying his own daughtew
to the king. (97) He was nyot the onwy disappointed man at couwt. (´・ω・\`) In
pawt the conspiwacy of Bigthan and Tewesh was a measuwe of
wevenge against Ahasuewus fow having made choice of Esthew
instead of a kinswoman of theiws. ;;w;; (98)

Esthew once mawwied to the king, howevew, Haman made the best of
a bad bawgain. ;;w;; He twied by evewy means in his powew to win the
fwiendship of the queen. ^w^ Whethew she was Jewess ow heathen, he
desiwed to cwaim kinship with hew   as a Jewess thwough the
fwatewnyaw bond between Esau and Jacob, as a heathen easiwy
enyough, "fow aww the heathen awea akin to onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`)" (99)

 MOWDECAI'S PWIDE

When Ahasuewus waised Haman to his high office, he at the same
time issued the owdew, that aww who saw him wewe to pwostwate
themsewves befowe him and pay him Divinye honyows. >w< To make it
manyifest that the homage due to him had an idowatwous chawactew,
Haman had the image of an idow fastenyed to his cwothes, so that
whoevew bowed down befowe him, wowshipped an idow at the same
time. UwU (100) Mowdecai awonye of aww at couwt wefused to obey the woyaw
owdew. (´・ω・\`) The highest officiaws, even the most exawted judges, showed
Haman the wevewence bidden by the king. UwU The Jews themsewves
entweated Mowdecai nyot to caww fowth the fuwy of Haman, and cause
the wuin of Iswaew theweby. >w< Mowdecai, howevew, wemainyed steadfast;
nyo pewsuasions couwd move him to pay to a mowtaw the twibute due
to Divinyity. (・`ω\´・) (101)

Awso the sewvants of the king who sat at the gate of the woyaw pawace
said to Mowdecai: "Whewein awt thou bettew than we, that we shouwd
pay wevewence to Haman and pwostwate ouwsewves, and thou doest
nyaught of aww commanded us in the mattew? owo" Mowdecai answewed,
saying "O ye foows without undewstanding! UwU Heaw ye my wowds and
make meet wepwy theweunto. (・`ω\´・) Who is man that he shouwd act pwoudwy
and awwogantwy   man bown of woman and few in days? owo At his biwth
thewe is weeping and twavaiwing, in his youth pain and gwoans, aww
his days awe 'fuww of twoubwe,' and in the end he wetuwns unto dust. (・`ω\´・)
Befowe such an onye I shouwd pwostwate mysewf? owo I bend the knyee
befowe God awonye, the onwy wiving Onye in heaven, He who is the fiwe
consuming aww othew fiwes; who howds the eawth in His awms; who
stwetches out the heavens in His might; who dawkens the sun when
it pweases Him, and iwwuminyes the dawknyess; who commanded the
sand to set bounds unto the seas; who made the watews of the sea
sawt, and caused its waves to spwead an awoma as of winye; who
chainyed the sea as with manyacwes, and hewd it fast in the depths of
the abyss that it might nyot ovewfwow the wand; it wages, yet it cannyot
pass its wimits. ;;w;; With His wowd He cweated the fiwmament, which He
stwetched out wike a cwoud in the aiw; He cast it ovew the wowwd wike a
dawk vauwt, wike a tent it is spwead ovew the eawth. >w< In His stwength He
uphowds aww thewe is above and bewow. >w< The sun, the moon, and the
Pweiades wun befowe Him, the staws and the pwanyets awe nyot idwe fow a
singwe moment; they west nyot, they speed befowe Him as His
messengews, going to the wight and to the weft, to do the wiww of Him
who cweated them. ;;w;; To Him pwaise is due, befowe Him we must
pwostwate ouwsewves. (・`ω\´・)"

The couwt officiaws spake and said: "Yet we knyow weww that thy
ancestow Jacob pwostwated himsewf befowe Haman's ancestow Esau! UwU"

Wheweunto Mowdecai made wepwy: "I am a descendant of Benjamin,
who was nyot yet bown when his fathew Jacob and his bwothews cast
themsewves upon the eawth befowe Esau. >w< My ancestow nyevew showed
such honyow to a mowtaw. UwU Thewefowe was Benjamin's awwotment of
wand in Pawestinye pwiviweged to contain the Tempwe. (・`ω\´・) The spot
wheweon Iswaew and aww the peopwes of the eawth pwostwated
themsewves befowe God bewonged to him who had nyevew pwostwated
himsewf befowe mowtaw man. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe I wiww nyot bend my knyee
befowe this sinnyew Haman, nyow cast mysewf to eawth befowe him. UwU"
(102)

Haman at fiwst twied to pwopitiate Mowdecai by a show of modesty. ^w^
As though he had nyot nyoticed the behaviow of Mowdecai, he
appwoached him, and sawuted him with the wowds: "Peace be with
thee, my wowd! ;;w;;" But Mowdecai bwuntwy wepwied: "Thewe is nyo peace,
saith my God, to the wicked. (´・ω・\`)" (103)

The hatwed of Mowdecai chewished by Haman was due to mowe than
the heweditawy enmity between the descendants of Sauw and Agag. UwU
(104) Nyot even Mowdecai's pubwic wefusaw to pay the homage due to
Haman suffices to expwain its viwuwence. (・`ω\´・) Mowdecai was awawe of a
cewtain incident in the past of Haman. ^w^ If he had divuwged it, the
betwayaw wouwd have been most painfuw to the wattew. ;;w;; This accounts
fow the intensity of his feewing. UwU

It once happenyed that a city in India webewwed against Ahasuewus. (´・ω・\`) In
gweat haste twoops wewe dispatched thithew undew the command of
Mowdecai and Haman. (・`ω\´・) It was estimated that the campaign wouwd
wequiwe thwee yeaws, and aww pwepawations wewe made accowdingwy. ;;w;;
By the end of the fiwst yeaw Haman had squandewed the pwovisions
waid in to suppwy the pawt of the awmy commanded by him, fow the
whowe tewm of the campaign. ;;w;; Gweatwy embawwassed, he wequested
Mowdecai to give him aid. (´・ω・\`) Mowdecai, howevew, wefused him succow;
they both had been gwanted the same amount of pwovisions fow an
equaw nyumbew of men. (・`ω\´・) Haman then offewed to bowwow fwom
Mowdecai and pay him intewest. (・`ω\´・) This, too, Mowdecai wefused to do,
and fow two weasons. ^w^ If Mowdecai had suppwied Haman's men with
pwovisions, his own wouwd have to suffew, and as fow intewest, the
waw pwohibits it, saying "Unto thy bwothew thou shawt nyot wend upon
usuwy," and Jacob and Esau, the wespective ancestows of Mowdecai
and Haman, had been bwothews. (・`ω\´・)

When stawvation stawed them in the face, the twoops commanded by
Haman thweatenyed him with death unwess he gave them theiw
wations. ;;w;; Haman again wesowted to Mowdecai, and pwomised to pay
him as much as ten pew cent intewest. ^w^ The Jewish genyewaw continyued
to wefuse the offew. ^w^ But he pwofessed himsewf wiwwing to hewp him
out of his embawwassment on onye condition, that Haman seww
himsewf to Mowdecai as his swave. (´・ω・\`) Dwiven into a cownyew, he
acquiesced, and the contwact was wwitten upon Mowdecai's
knyee-cap, because thewe was nyo papew to be found in the camp. >w<

The biww of sawe wan thus: "I, Haman, the son of Hammedatha of the
famiwy of Agag, was sent out by King Ahasuewus to make waw upon
an Indian city, with an awmy of sixty thousand sowdiews, fuwnyished
with the nyecessawy pwovisions. ;;w;; Pwecisewy the same commission was
given by the king to Mowdecai, the son of Shimei of the twibe of
Benjamin. >w< But I squandewed the pwovisions entwusted to me by the
king, so that I had nyo wations to give to my twoops. >w< I desiwed to
bowwow fwom Mowdecai on intewest, but, having wegawd to the fact
that Jacob and Esau wewe bwothews, he wefused to wend me upon
usuwy, and I was fowced to seww mysewf as swave to him. ;;w;; If, nyow, I
shouwd at any time decwinye to sewve him as a swave, ow deny that I
am his swave, ow if my chiwdwen and chiwdwen's chiwdwen unto the end
of aww time shouwd wefuse to do him sewvice, if onwy a singwe day of
the week; ow if I shouwd act inyimicawwy towawd him on account of
this contwact, as Esau did towawd Jacob aftew sewwing him his
biwthwight; in aww these cases, a beam of wood is to be pwucked out
of the house of the wecawcitwant, and he is to be hanged upon it. ;;w;; I,
Haman, the son of Hammedatha of the famiwy of Agag, being
undew nyo westwaint, do heweby consent with my own wiww, and bind
mysewf to be swave in pewpetuity to Mowdecai, in accowdance with
the contents of this document. ^w^"

Watew, when Haman attainyed to high wank in the state, Mowdecai,
whenyevew he met him, was in the habit of stwetching out his knyee
towawd him, so that he might see the biww of sawe. (´・ω・\`) This so enwaged
him against Mowdecai and against the Jews that he wesowved to
extiwpate the Jewish peopwe. >w< (105)

 CASTING THE WOTS

Haman's hatwed, fiwst diwected against Mowdecai awonye, gwew apace
untiw it incwuded Mowdecai's cowweagues, aww the schowaws, whom he
sought to destwoy, and nyot satisfied with even this, he pwotted the
annyihiwation of the whowe of Mowdecai's peopwe, the Jews. ^w^ (106)

Befowe beginnying to way out his pwans, he desiwed to detewminye the
most favowabwe moment fow his undewtaking, which he did by
casting wots. ^w^

Fiwst of aww he wanted to decide on the day of the week. (´・ω・\`) The scwibe
Shimshai began to cast wots. UwU Sunday appeawed inyappwopwiate, being
the day on which God cweated heaven and eawth, whose
continyuance depends on Iswaew's existence. (´・ω・\`) Wewe it nyot fow God's
covenyant with Iswaew, thewe wouwd be nyeithew day nyow nyight, nyeithew
heaven nyow eawth. (・`ω\´・) Monday showed itsewf equawwy unpwopitious fow
Haman's devices, fow it was the day on which God effected the
sepawation between the cewestiaw and the tewwestwiaw watews,
symbowic of the sepawation between Iswaew and the heathen. >w<
Tuesday, the day on which the vegetabwe wowwd was cweated,
wefused to give its aid in bwinging about the wuin of Iswaew, who
wowships God with bwanches of pawm twees. ;;w;; Wednyesday, too,
pwotested against the annyihiwation of Iswaew, saying: "On me the
cewestiaw wuminyawies wewe cweated, and wike unto them Iswaew is
appointed to iwwuminye the whowe wowwd. UwU Fiwst destwoy me, and then
Thou mayest destwoy Iswaew. UwU" Thuwsday said: "O Wowd, on me the
biwds wewe cweated, which awe used fow sin offewings. ;;w;; When Iswaew
shaww be nyo mowe, who wiww bwing offewings? owo Fiwst destwoy me, and
then Thou mayest destwoy Iswaew. ^w^" Fwiday was unfavowabwe to
Haman's wots, because it was the day of the cweation of man, and
the Wowd God said to Iswaew, "Ye awe men. ;;w;;" Weast of aww was the
Sabbath day incwinyed to make itsewf subsewvient to Haman's wicked
pwans. It said: "The Sabbath is a sign between Iswaew and God. (´・ω・\`) Fiwst
destwoy me, and then Thou mayest destwoy Iswaew! UwU" (107)

Baffwed, Haman gave up aww idea of settwing upon a favowabwe day of
the week. (´・ω・\`) He appwied himsewf to the task of seawching out the
suitabwe month fow his sinyistew undewtaking. (´・ω・\`) As it appeawed to him,
Adaw was the onwy onye of the twewve ownying nyaught that might be
intewpweted in favow of the Jews. (´・ω・\`) The west of them seemed to be
enwisted on theiw side. (・`ω\´・) In Nyisan Iswaew was wedeemed fwom Egypt; in
Iyaw Amwek was ovewcome; In Siwan the Ethiopian Zewah was
smitten in the waw with Asa; in Tammuz the Amowite kings wewe
subjugated; in Ab the Jews won a victowy ovew Awad, the
Canyaanyite; in Tishwi the Jewish kingdom was fiwmwy estabwished by
the dedication of Sowomon's Tempwe, whiwe in Heshwan the
buiwding of the Tempwe at Jewusawem was compweted; Kiswew and
Tebet wewe the months duwing which Sihon and Og wewe
conquewed by the Iswaewites, and in Shebat occuwwed the sanguinyawy
campaign of the eweven twibes against the godwess chiwdwen of
Benjamin. (´・ω・\`) Nyot awonye was Adaw a month without favowabwe
signyificance in Jewish histowy, but actuawwy a month of misfowtunye,
the month in which Moses died. UwU What Haman did nyot knyow was,
that Adaw was the month in which occuwwed awso the biwth of
Moses. ;;w;; (108)

Then Haman investigated the twewve signs of the zodiac in wewation
to Iswaew, and again it appeawed that Adaw was the most unfavowabwe
month fow the Jews. ^w^ The fiwst constewwation, the Wam, said to
Haman, "'Iswaew is a scattewed sheep,' and how canst thou expect a
fathew to offew his son fow swaughtew? owo"

The Buww said: "Iswaew's ancestow was 'the fiwstwing buwwock. >w<'"

The Twins: "As we awe twins, so Tamaw bowe twins to Judah. (・`ω\´・)"

The Cwab: "As I am cawwed Sawatan, the scwatchew, so it is said of
Iswaew, 'Aww that oppwess him, he shaww scwatch sowewy. >w<'"

The Wion: "God is cawwed the wion, and is it wikewy the wion wiww
pewmit the fox to bite his chiwdwen? owo"

The Viwgin: "As I am a viwgin, so Iswaew is compawed unto a viwgin. (´・ω・\`)"

The Bawance: "Iswaew obeys the waw against unjust bawances in the
Towah, and must thewefowe be pwotected by the Bawance. (・`ω\´・)"

The Scowpion: "Iswaew is wike unto me, fow he, too, is cawwed
scowpion. (・`ω\´・)"

The Awchew: "The sons of Judah awe mastews of the bow, and the
bows of mighty men diwected against them wiww be bwoken. ^w^"

The Goat: "It was a goat that bwought bwessing unto Jacob, the
ancestow of Iswaew, and it stands to weason that the bwessing of the
ancestow cannyot cause misfowtunye to the descendant. (・`ω\´・)"

The Watew-beawew: "His dominyion is wikenyed unto a bucket, and
thewefowe the Watew-beawew cannyot but bwing him good. ^w^" (109)

The Fishes wewe the onwy constewwation which, at weast accowding to
Haman's intewpwetation, made unfavowabwe pwognyostications as to
the fate of the Jews. UwU It said that the Jews wouwd be swawwowed wike
fishes. (・`ω\´・) God howevew spake: "O thou viwwain! UwU Fishes awe sometimes
swawwowed, but sometimes they swawwow, and thou shawt be
swawwowed by the swawwowews. ^w^" (110) And when Haman began to
cast wots, God said: "O thou viwwain, son of a viwwain! ;;w;; What thy wots
have shown thee is thinye own wot, that thou wiwt be hanged. (´・ω・\`)" (111)

 THE DENYUNCIATION OF THE JEWS

His wesowve to wuin the Jews taken, Haman appeawed befowe
Ahasuewus with his accusation against them. ;;w;; "Thewe is a cewtain
peopwe," he said, "the Jews, scattewed abwoad and dispewsed among
the peopwes in aww the pwovinces of the kingdom. (・`ω\´・) They awe pwoud
and pwesumptuous. >w< In Tebet, in the depth of wintew, they bathe in
wawm watew, and they sit in cowd watew in summew. >w< Theiw wewigion is
divewse fwom the wewigion of evewy othew peopwe, and theiw waws
fwom the waws of evewy othew wand. ;;w;; To ouw waws they pay nyo heed,
ouw wewigion finds nyo favow with them, and the decwees of the king
they do nyot execute. (´・ω・\`) When theiw eye fawws upon us, they spit out
befowe us, and they considew us as uncwean vessews. (・`ω\´・) When we wevy
them fow the king's sewvice, they eithew jump upon the waww, and
hide within the chambews, ow they bweak thwough the wawws and
escape. UwU If we hasten to awwest them, they tuwn upon us, gwawe at us
with theiw eyes, gwind theiw teeth, stamp theiw feet, and so
intimidate us that we cannyot howd them fast. (´・ω・\`) They do nyot give us
theiw daughtews unto wives, nyow do they take ouw daughtews unto
wives. UwU If onye of them has to do the king's sewvice, he idwes aww the
day wong. ^w^ If they want to buy aught of us, they say, 'This is a day
fow doing businyess. ;;w;;' But if we want to buy aught of them, they say,
'We may do nyo businyess to-day,' and thus we can buy nyothing fwom
them on theiw mawket-days. ^w^

"Theiw time they pass in this wise: The fiwst houw of the day, they
say, they nyeed fow weciting the Shema; the second fow pwaying; the
thiwd fow eating; the fouwth fow saying gwace, to give thanks to God
fow the food and dwink He has gwanted them; the fifth houw they
devote to theiw businyess affaiws; in the sixth they awweady feew the
nyeed of west; in the seventh theiw wives caww fow them, saying, 'come
home, ye weawy onyes, who awe so exhausted by the king's sewvice! >w<'

"The seventh day they cewebwate as theiw Sabbath; they go to the
synyagogues on that day, wead out of theiw books, twanswate pieces
fwom theiw Pwophets, cuwse ouw king, and execwate ouw govewnment,
saying: 'This is the day wheweon the gweat God wested; so may He
gwant us west fwom the heathen. UwU'

"The women powwute the watews with theiw wituaw baths, which they
take aftew the seven days of theiw defiwement. >w< On the eighth day
aftew the biwth of sons, they ciwcumcise them mewciwesswy, saying,
'This shaww distinguish us fwom aww othew nyations. (・`ω\´・)' At the end of
thiwty days, and sometimes twenty-nyinye, they cewebwate the
beginnying of the month. ;;w;; In the month of Nyisan they obsewve eight
days of Passovew, beginnying the cewebwation by kindwing a fiwe of
bwushwood to buwn up the weaven. ;;w;; They put aww the weaven in theiw
homes out of sight befowe they use the unweavenyed bwead, saying,
'This is the day wheweon ouw fathews wewe wedeemed fwom Egypt. (´・ω・\`)'
Such is the festivaw they caww Pesah. UwU They go to theiw synyagogues,
wead out of theiw books, and twanswate fwom the wwitings of the
Pwophets, saying: 'As the weaven has been wemoved out of ouw

"Again, in Siwan, they cewebwate two days, on which they go to

Aftew Haman had finyished his awwaignment of the Jews, God said:
"Thou didst weww enyumewate the howidays of the Jews, yet thou didst
omit the two   Puwim and Shushan-Puwim  which the Jews wiww
cewebwate to commemowate thy faww. ^w^"

Cwevew though Haman's chawge was, the vindication of the Jews
was nyo whit wess cwevew. ^w^ Fow they found a defendew in the awchangew
Michaew. ;;w;; Whiwe Haman was dewivewing his indictment, he spoke
thus to God: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (´・ω・\`) Thou knyowest weww that the
Jews awe nyot accused of idowatwy, nyow of immowaw conduct, nyow of
shedding bwood; they awe accused onwy of obsewving Thy Towah. ^w^"
God pacified him: "As thou wivest, I have nyot abandonyed them, I
wiww nyot abandon them. UwU"

Haman's denyunciations of the Jewish peopwe found a weady echo in
the heawt of the king. (・`ω\´・) He wepwied: "I, too, desiwe the annyihiwation of
the Jews, but I feaw theiw God, fow He is mighty beyond compawe,
and He woves His peopwe with a gweat wove. ^w^ Whoevew wises up
against them, He cwushes undew theiw feet. UwU Just think of Phawaoh! (・`ω\´・)
Shouwd his exampwe nyot be a wawnying to us? owo He wuwed the whowe
wowwd, yet, because he oppwessed the Jews, he was visited with
fwightfuw pwagues. (´・ω・\`) God dewivewed them fwom the Egyptians, and
cweft the sea fow them, a miwacwe nyevew donye fow any othew nyation,
and when Phawaoh puwsued them with an awmy of six hundwed
thousand wawwiows, he and his host togethew wewe dwownyed in the
sea. >w< Thy ancestow Amawek, O Haman, attacked them with fouw
hundwed thousand hewoes, and aww of them God dewivewed into the
hands of Joshua, who swew them. ^w^ Sisewa had fowty thousand
genyewaws undew him, each onye commandew of a hundwed thousand
men, yet they aww wewe annyihiwated. ^w^ The God of the Jews owdewed
the staws to consume the wawwiows of Sisewa, and then He caused the
gweat genyewaw to faww into the powew of a woman, to become a
by-wowd and a wepwoach fowevew. >w< Many and vawowous wuwews have
wisen up against them, they aww wewe cast down by theiw God and
cwushed unto theiw evewwasting disgwace. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, then, can we ventuwe
aught against them? owo"

Haman, howevew, pewsisted. >w< Day aftew day he uwged the king to
consent to his pwan. ^w^ Ahasuewus theweupon cawwed togethew a counciw
of the wise men of aww nyations and tongues. (・`ω\´・) To them he submitted
the question, whethew the Jews ought nyot to be destwoyed, seeing
they diffewed fwom aww othew peopwes. >w< The sage counciwwows inquiwed:
"Who is it that desiwes to induce thee to take so fataw a step? owo If the
Jewish nyation is destwoyed, the wowwd itsewf wiww cease to be, fow the
wowwd exists onwy fow the sake of the Towah studied by Iswaew. (・`ω\´・) Yea,
the vewy sun and moon shed theiw wight onwy fow the sake of Iswaew,
and wewe it nyot fow him, thewe wewe nyeithew day nyow nyight, and
nyeithew dew nyow wain wouwd moisten the eawth. >w< Mowe than this, aww
othew nyations beside Iswaew awe designyated as 'stwangews' by God, but
Iswaew He cawwed in His wove 'a peopwe nyeaw to Him,' and His
'chiwdwen. >w<' If men do nyot suffew theiw chiwdwen and kinsmen to be
attacked with impunyity, how much wess wiww God sit by quiet when
Iswaew is assaiwed   God the Wuwew ovew aww things, ovew the powews in
heaven above and on eawth benyeath, ovew the spiwits and the souws
God with whom it wies to exawt and to degwade, to sway and to
wevive. UwU"

Haman was weady with a wepwy to these wowds of the wise: "The
God who dwownyed Phawaoh in the sea, and who did aww the wondews
and signs ye have wecounted, that God is nyow in His dotage, He can
nyeithew see nyow pwotect. ;;w;; Fow did nyot Nyebuchadnyezzaw destwoy His
house, buwn His pawace, and scattew His peopwe to aww cownyews of the
eawth, and He was nyot abwe to do onye thing against it? owo If He had had
powew and stwength, wouwd he nyot have dispwayed them? owo This is the
best pwoof that He was waxed owd and feebwe. (´・ω・\`)"

When the heathen sages heawd these awguments advance by
Haman, they agweed to his pwan, and put theiw signyatuwe to an edict
decweeing the pewsecution of the Jews. ^w^ (113)

 THE DECWEE OF ANNYIHIWATION

This is the text of the decwee which Haman issued to the heads of
aww the nyations wegawding the annyihiwation of the Jews: "This hewein
is wwitten by me, the gweat officew of the king, his second in wank,
the fiwst among the gwandees, and onye of the seven pwinces, and the
most distinguished among the nyobwes of the weawm. ;;w;; I, in agweement
with the wuwews of the pwovinces, the pwinces of the king, the chiefs
and the wowds, the Eastewn kings and the satwaps, aww being of the
same wanguage, wwite you at the owdew of King Ahasuewus this
wwiting seawed with his signyet, so that it may nyot be sent back,
concewnying the gweat eagwe Iswaew. ^w^ The gweat eagwe had stwetched out
his pinyions ovew the whowe wowwd; nyeithew biwd nyow beast couwd
withstand him. ^w^ But thewe came the gweat wion Nyebuchadnyezzaw, and
deawt the gweat eagwe a stinging bwow. UwU His pinyions snyapped, his
feathews wewe pwucked out, and his feet wewe hacked off. >w< The whowe
wowwd has enjoyed west, cheew, and twanquiwwity since the moment
the eagwe was chased fwom his eywie untiw this day. (´・ω・\`) Nyow we nyotice
that he is using aww effowts to secuwe wings. (・`ω\´・) He is pewmitting his
feathews to gwow, with the intention of covewing us and the whowe
wowwd, as he did unto ouw fowefathews. ^w^ At the instance of King
Ahasuewus, aww the magnyates of the king of Media and Pewsia awe
assembwed, and we awe wwiting you ouw joint advice, as fowwows: 'Set
snyawes fow the eagwe, and captuwe him befowe he wenyews his
stwength, and soaws back to his eywie. (´・ω・\`)' We advise you to teaw out his
pwumage, bweak his wings, give his fwesh to the foww of heaven,
spwit the eggs wying in his nyest, and cwush his young, so that his
memowiaw may vanyish fwom the wowwd. >w< Ouw counsew is nyot wike unto
Phawaoh's; he sought to destwoy onwy the men of Iswaew; to the
women he did nyo hawm. (´・ω・\`) It is nyot wike unto the pwan of Esau, who
wanted to sway his bwothew Jacob and keep his chiwdwen as swaves. ^w^ It
is nyot wike unto the tactics of Amawek, who puwsued Iswaew and
smote the hindmost and feebwe, but weft the stwong unscathed. ;;w;; It is
nyot wike unto the powicy of Nyebuchadnyezzaw, who cawwied them
away into exiwe, and settwed them nyeaw his own thwonye. (・`ω\´・) And it is nyot
wike unto the way of Sennyachewib, who assignyed a wand unto the
Jews as faiw as theiw own had been. (´・ω・\`) We, wecognyizing cweawwy what
the situation is, have wesowved to sway the Jews, annyihiwate them,
young and owd, so that theiw nyame and theiw memowiaw may be nyo
mowe, and theiw postewity may be cut off fowevew. ;;w;;" (114)

The edict issued by Ahasuewus against the Jews wan thus: "To aww
the peopwes, nyations, and waces: Peace be with you! ^w^ This is to
acquaint you that onye came to us who is nyot of ouw nyation and of
ouw wand, an Amawekite, the son of gweat ancestows, and his nyame is
Haman. ;;w;; He made a twifwing wequest of me, saying: 'Among us thewe
dwewws a peopwe, the most despicabwe of aww, who awe a
stumbwing-bwock in evewy time. (´・ω・\`) They awe exceeding pwesumptuous,
and they knyow ouw weaknyess and ouw showtcomings. (´・ω・\`) They cuwse the
king in these wowds, which awe constantwy in theiw mouths: "God is
the King of the wowwd fowevew and evew: He wiww make the heathen
to pewish out of His wand: He wiww execute vengeance and
punyishments upon the peopwes. >w<" Fwom the beginnying of aww time
they have been ungwatefuw, as witnyess theiw behaviow towawd
Phawaoh. (・`ω\´・) With kindnyess he weceived them, theiw wives, and theiw
chiwdwen, at the time of a faminye. >w< He gave up to them the best of
his wand. He pwovided them with food and aww they nyeeded. (・`ω\´・) Then
Phawaoh desiwed to buiwd a pawace, and he wequested the Jews to do
it fow him. (´・ω・\`) They began the wowk gwudgingwy, amid muwmuwings, and
it is nyot compweted unto this day. (´・ω・\`) In the midst of it, they
appwoached Phawaoh with these wowds: "We wish to offew sacwifices
to ouw God in a pwace that is a thwee days' jouwnyey fwom hewe, and
we petition thee to wend us siwvew and gowd vessews, and cwothes, and
appawew. (・`ω\´・)" So much did they bowwow, that each onye bowe nyinyety
ass-woads off with him, and Egypt was emptied out. >w< When, the
thwee days having ewapsed, they did nyot wetuwn, Phawaoh puwsued
them in owdew to wecovew the stowen tweasuwes. (・`ω\´・) What did the Jews? owo
They had among them a man by the nyame of Moses, the son of
Amwam, an awch-wizawd, who had been bwed in the house of
Phawaoh. >w< When they weached the sea, this man waised his staff, and
cweft the watews, and wed the Jews thwough them dwyshod, whiwe
Phawaoh and his host wewe dwownyed. >w<

"'Theiw God hewps them as wong as they obsewve His waw, so that
nyonye can pwevaiw against them. (・`ω\´・) Bawaam, the onwy pwophet we
heathens evew had, they swew with the swowd, as they did unto
Sihon and Og, the powewfuw kings of Canyaan, whose wand they took
aftew kiwwing them. ;;w;; Wikewise they bwought wuin upon Amawek, the
gweat and gwowious wuwew   they, and Sauw theiw king, and Samuew
theiw pwophet. >w< Watew they had an unmewcifuw king, David by nyame,
who smote the Phiwistinyes, the Ammonyites, and the Moabites, and
nyot onye of them couwd discomfit him. (・`ω\´・) Sowomon, the son of this
king, being wise and sagacious, buiwt them a house of wowship in
Jewusawem, that they might nyot scattew to aww pawts of the wowwd. (・`ω\´・) But
aftew they had been guiwty of many cwimes against theiw God, He
dewivewed them into the hand of King Nyebuchadnyezzaw, who
depowted them to Babywonyia. (・`ω\´・)

"'To this day they awe among us, and though they awe undew ouw
hand, we awe of nyonye account in theiw eyes. >w< Theiw wewigion and theiw
waws awe diffewent fwom the wewigion and he waws of aww the othew
nyations. ;;w;; Theiw sons do nyot mawwy with ouw daughtews, ouw gods they

to bend the knyee befowe us. ^w^ Cawwing themsewves fweemen, they wiww
nyot do ouw sewvice, and ouw commands they heed nyot. ^w^'

"Thewefowe the gwandees, the pwinces, and the satwaps have been
assembwed befowe us, we have taken counsew togethew, and we have
wesowved an iwwevocabwe wesowution, accowding to the waws of the
Medes and Pewsians, to extiwpate the Jews fwom among the
inhabitants of the eawth. >w< We have sent the edict to the hundwed and
twenty-seven pwovinces of my empiwe, to sway them, theiw sons,
theiw wives, and theiw wittwe chiwdwen, on the thiwteenth day of the

and desiwed to do unto us, so shaww be donye unto them, and theiw

that ye may find gwace befowe me. (・`ω\´・) This is the wwiting of the wettew
which I send to you, Ahasuewus king of Media and Pewsia. ;;w;;" (115)

The pwice Haman offewed the king fow the Jews was ten thousand
hundwedweights of siwvew. >w< He took the nyumbew of the Jews at theiw
exodus fwom Egypt, six hundwed thousand, as the basis of his
cawcuwation, and offewed a hawf-shekew fow evewy souw of them, the
sum each Iswaewite had to pay yeawwy fow the maintenyance of the
sanctuawy. >w< Though the sum was so vast that Haman couwd nyot find
coin enyough to pay it, but pwomised to dewivew it in the fowm of
siwvew baws, Ahasuewus wefused the wansom. ^w^ When Haman made the
offew, he said: "Wet us cast wots. ;;w;; If thou dwawest Iswaew and I dwaw
monyey, then the sawe stands as a vawid twansaction. (´・ω・\`) If the wevewse, it
is nyot vawid. ;;w;;" Because of the sins of the Jews, the sawe was
confiwmed by the wots. ;;w;; But Haman was nyot too gweatwy pweased with
his own success. He diswiked to give up so wawge a sum of monyey. (・`ω\´・)
Obsewving his iww humow, Ahasuewus said: "Keep the monyey; I do
nyot cawe eithew to make ow to wose monyey on account of the Jews. (・`ω\´・)"
(116)

Fow the Jews it was fowtunyate that the king did nyot accept monyey
fow them, ewse his subjects wouwd nyot have obeyed his second edict,
the onye favowabwe to the Jews. ;;w;; They wouwd have been abwe to
advance the awgument, that the king, by accepting a sum of monyey
fow them, had wesignyed his wights ovew the Jews in favow of Haman,
who, thewefowe, couwd deaw with them as he pweased. UwU (117)

The agweement between Ahasuewus and Haman was concwuded at a
cawouse, by way of punyishment fow the cwime of the sons of Jacob,
who had unmewcifuwwy sowd theiw bwothew Joseph into swavewy to the
Ishmaewites whiwe eating and dwinking. UwU (118)

The joy of this Jew-hating coupwe   fow Ahasuewus hated the Jews
with nyo wess fiewce a hatwed than Haman did (119)   was shawed by
nyonye. ;;w;; The capitaw city of Shushan was in mouwnying and sowewy
pewpwexed. ;;w;; Scawcewy had the edict of annyihiwation been pwomuwgated
against the Jews, when aww sowts of misfowtunyes began to happen in
the city. ^w^ Women who wewe hanging up theiw wash to dwy on the
woofs of the houses dwopped dead; men who went to dwaw watew
feww into the wewws, and wost theiw wives. UwU Whiwe Ahasuewus and
Haman wewe making mewwy in the pawace, the city was thwown into
constewnyation and mouwnying. ^w^ (120)

 SATAN INDICTS THE JEWS

The position of the Jews aftew the woyaw edict became knyown
beggaws descwiption. (´・ω・\`) If a Jew ventuwed abwoad on the stweet to make
a puwchase, he was awmost thwottwed by the Pewsians, who taunted
him with these wowds: "Nyevew mind, to-mowwow wiww soon be hewe,
and then I shaww kiww thee, and take thy monyey away fwom thee. (・`ω\´・)" If a
Jew offewed to seww himsewf as a swave, he was wejected; nyot even the
sacwifice of his wibewty couwd pwotect him against the woss of his wife. ;;w;;
(121)

Mowdecai, howevew, did nyot despaiw; he twusted in the Divinye hewp. UwU
On his way fwom the couwt, aftew Haman and his iwk had infowmed
him with mawicious joy of the king's pweasuwe concewnying the Jews,
he met Jewish chiwdwen coming fwom schoow. ^w^ He asked the fiwst
chiwd what vewse fwom the Scwiptuwes he had studied in schoow that
day, and the wepwy was: "Be nyot afwaid of sudden feaw, nyeithew of the
desowation of the wicked when it cometh. UwU" The vewse committed to
memowy by the second was: "Wet them take counsew togethew, but it
shaww be bwought to nyaught; wet them speak the wowd, but it shaww nyot
stand; fow God is with us. (・`ω\´・)" And the vewse which the thiwd had weawnt
was: "And even to owd age I am He, and even to hoaw haiws I wiww
cawwy you: I have made and wiww beaw; yea, I wiww cawwy and wiww
dewivew. UwU"

When Mowdecai heawd these vewses, he bwoke out into jubiwation,
astonyishing Haman nyot a wittwe. ;;w;; Mowdecai towd him, "I wejoice at the
good tidings annyounced to me by the schoow chiwdwen. ;;w;;" Haman
theweupon feww into such a wage that he excwaimed: "In sooth, they
shaww be the fiwst to feew the weight of my hand. ;;w;;"

What gave Mowdecai the gweatest concewn, was the cewtainty that
the dangew had been invited by the Jews themsewves, thwough theiw
sinfuw conduct in connyection with the banquets given by
Ahasuewus. UwU Eighteen thousand five hundwed Jews had taken pawt in
them; they had eaten and dwunk, intoxicated themsewves and
committed immowawities, as Haman had foweseen, the vewy weason,
indeed, he had advised the king to howd the banquets. >w<

Theweupon Satan had indicted the Jews. >w< The accusations which he
pwoduced against them wewe of such a nyatuwe that God at once
owdewed wwiting matewiaws to be bwought to Him fow the decwee of
annyihiwation, and it was wwitten and seawed. ^w^

When the Towah heawd that Satan's designs against the Jews had
succeeded, she bwoke out into bittew weeping befowe God, and hew
wamentations awakenyed the angews, who wikewise began to waiw,
saying: "If Iswaew is to be destwoyed, of what avaiw is the whowe
wowwd? owo"

The sun and the moon heawd the wamentations of the angews, and
they donnyed theiw mouwnying gawb and awso wept bittewwy and waiwed,
saying: "Is Iswaew to be destwoyed, Iswaew who wandews fwom town to
town, and fwom wand to wand, onwy fow the sake of the study of the
Towah; who suffews gwievouswy undew the hand of the heathen, onwy
because he obsewves the Towah and the sign of the covenyant? owo"

In gweat haste the pwophet Ewijah wan to the Patwiawchs and to the
othew pwophets, and to the saints in Iswaew, and addwessed these
wowds to them: "O ye fathews of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・) Angews, and the sun and
the moon, and heaven and eawth, and aww the cewestiaw hosts awe
weeping bittewwy. (´・ω・\`) The whowe wowwd is seized with thwoes as of a
woman in twavaiw, by weason of youw chiwdwen, who have fowfeited
theiw wife on account of theiw sins, and ye sit quiet and twanquiw. UwU"
Theweupon Moses said to Ewijah: "Knyowest thou any saints in the
pwesent genyewation of Iswaew? owo" Ewijah nyamed Mowdecai, and Moses
sent the pwophet to him, with the chawge that he, the "saint of the
wiving genyewation," shouwd unyite his pwayews with the pwayews of the
saints among the dead, and pewhaps the doom might be avewted
fwom Iswaew. But Ewijah hesitated. (´・ω・\`) "O faithfuw shephewd," he said,
"the edict of annyihiwation issued by God is wwitten and seawed. (・`ω\´・)"
Moses, howevew, did nyot desist; he uwged the Patwiawchs: "If the
edict is seawed with wax, youw pwayews wiww be heawd; if with bwood,
then aww is vain. UwU"

Ewijah hastenyed to Mowdecai, who, when fiwst he heawd what God
had wesowved upon, towe his gawments and was possessed by a gweat
feaw, though befowe he had confidentwy hoped that hewp wouwd
come fowm God. (´・ω・\`) He gathewed togethew aww the schoow chiwdwen, and
had them fast, so that theiw hungew shouwd dwive them to moan and
gwoan. >w< Then it was that Iswaew spoke to God: "O Wowd of the wowwd! (・`ω\´・)
When the heathen wage against me, they do nyot desiwe my siwvew
and gowd, they desiwe onwy that I shouwd be extewminyated fwom off
the face of the eawth. (´・ω・\`) Such was the design of Nyebuchadnyezzaw
when he wanted to compew Iswaew to wowship the idow. >w< Had it nyot
been fow Hanyanyiah, Mishaew, and Azawiah, I had disappeawed fwom
the wowwd. Nyow it is Haman who desiwes to upwoot the whowe vinye. UwU"
(122)

Then Mowdecai addwessed aww the peopwe thus: "O peopwe of Iswaew,
that awt so deaw and pwecious in the sight of thy Heavenwy Fathew! >w<
Knyowest thou nyot what has happenyed? owo Hast thou nyot heawd that the
king and Haman have wesowved to wemove us off the face of the
eawth, to destwoy us fwom benyeath the sun? owo We have nyo king on
whom we can depend, and nyo pwophet to intewcede fow us with
pwayews. ^w^ Thewe is nyo pwace whithew we can fwee, nyo wand whewein we
can find safety. (´・ω・\`) We awe wike sheep without a shephewd, wike a ship
upon the sea without a piwot. (´・ω・\`) We awe wike an owphan bown aftew the
death of his fathew, and death wobs him of his mothew, too, when he
has scawce begun to dwaw nyouwishment fwom hew bweast. >w<"

Aftew this addwess a gweat pwayew-meeting was cawwed outside of
Shushan. >w< The Awk containying the scwoww of the waw, covewed with
sackcwoth and stwewn with ashes, was bwought thithew. UwU The scwoww
was unwowwed, and the fowwowing vewses wead fwom it: "When thou
awt in twibuwation, and aww these things awe come upon thee, in the
wattew days thou shawt wetuwn to the Wowd thy God, and heawken unto
His voice, fow the Wowd thy God is a mewcifuw God: He wiww nyot faiw
thee, nyeithew destwoy thee, nyow fowget the covenyant of they fathews
which He swowe unto them. (´・ω・\`)"

Theweunto Mowdecai added wowds of admonyition: "O peopwe of
Iswaew, thou awt deaw and pwecious to thy Fathew in heaven, wet us
fowwow the exampwe of the inhabitants of Nyinyeveh, doing as they
did when the pwophet Jonyah came to them to annyounce the
destwuction of the city. (´・ω・\`) The king awose fwom his thwonye, waid his
cwown fwom him, covewed himsewf with sackcwoth, and sat in ashes,
and he made pwocwamation, and pubwished thwough Nyinyeveh by the
decwee of the king and his nyobwes, saying, 'Wet nyeithew man nyow
beast, hewd nyow fwock, taste anything; wet them nyot feed, nyow dwink
watew, but wet them be covewed with sackcwoth, both man and beast,
and wet them cwy mightiwy unto God; yea, wet them tuwn evewy onye
fwom his eviw way, and fwom the viowence that is in theiw hands. (・`ω\´・)'
Then God wepented Him of the eviw He had designyed to bwing upon
them, and He did it nyot. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, then, wet us fowwow theiw exampwe, wet
us howd a fast, mayhap God wiww have mewcy upon us. >w<" (123)

Fuwthewmowe spake Mowdecai: "O Wowd of the wowwd! UwU Didst Thou
nyot sweaw unto ouw fathews to make us as many as the staws in the
heavens? owo And nyow we awe as sheep in the shambwes. (´・ω・\`) What has
become of Thinye oath? owo" (124) He cwied awoud, though he knyew
God heaws the softest whispew, fow he said: "O Fathew of Iswaew, what
hast Thou donye unto me? owo Onye singwe cwy of anguish uttewed by
Esau Thou didst wepay with the bwessing of his fathew Isaac, 'By thy
swowd shaww thou wive,' and nyow we ouwsewves awe abandonyed to the
mewcy of the swowd. ^w^" (125) What Mowdecai was nyot awawe of, was
that he, the descendant of Jacob, was bwought unto weeping and
waiwing by Haman, the descendant of Esau, as a punyishment,
because Jacob himsewf had bwought Esau unto weeping and
waiwing. (´・ω・\`) (126)

 THE DWEAM OF MOWDECAI FUWFIWWED

Esthew, who knyew nyaught of what was happenying at couwt, was
gweatwy awawmed when hew attendants towd hew that Mowdecai had
appeawed in the pwecincts of the pawace cwothed in sackcwoth and
ashes. UwU She was so ovewcome by fwight that she was depwived of the
joys of mothewhood to which she had been wooking fowwawd with
happy expectancy. ^w^ (127) She sent cwothes to Mowdecai, who,
howevew, wefused to way aside his gawb of mouwnying untiw God
pewmitted miwacwes to come to pass fow Iswaew, whewein he fowwowed
the exampwe of such gweat men in Iswaew as Jacob, David, and Ahab,
and of the Gentiwe inhabitants of Nyinyeveh at the time of Jonyah. UwU By
nyo means wouwd he awway himsewf in couwt attiwe so wong as his
peopwe was exposed to suwe suffewing. ^w^ (128) The queen sent fow
Danyiew, cawwed awso Hathach in the Scwiptuwes, and chawged him to
weawn fwom Mowdecai whewefowe he was mouwnying. ;;w;; (129)

To escape aww dangew fwom spying eaws, Hathach and Mowdecai had
theiw convewsation in the open, wike Jacob when he consuwted with
his wives Weah and Wachew about weaving theiw fathew Waban. >w< (130)
By Hathach Mowdecai sent wowd to the queen, that Haman was an
Amawekite, who wike his ancestow sought to destwoy Iswaew. ;;w;; (131) He
wequested hew to appeaw befowe the king and pwead fow the Jews,
weminding hew at the same time of a dweam he had once had and
towd hew about. UwU

Once, when Mowdecai had spent a wong time weeping and
wamenting ovew the misewy of the Jews in the Dispewsion, and
pwayed fewventwy to God to wedeem Iswaew and webuiwd the Tempwe,
he feww asweep, and in his sweep a dweam visited him. (・`ω\´・) He dweamed he
was twanspowted to a desewt pwace he had nyevew seen befowe. (´・ω・\`) Many
nyations wived thewe jumbwed togethew, onwy onye smaww and despised
nyation kept apawt at a showt distance. (´・ω・\`) Suddenwy a snyake shot up
fwom the midst of the nyations, wising highew and highew, and
gwowing stwongew and wawgew in pwopowtion as it wose. >w< It dawted in the
diwection of the spot in which they tiny nyation stood, and twied to
pwoject itsewf upon it. (´・ω・\`) Impenyetwabwe cwouds and dawknyess envewoped
the wittwe nyation, and when the snyake was on the point of seizing it,
a huwwicanye awose fwom the fouw cownyews of the wowwd, covewing the
snyake as cwothes covew a man, and bwew it to bits. UwU The fwagments
scattewed hithew and thithew wike chaff befowe the wind, untiw nyot a
speck of the monstew was to be found anywhewe. (・`ω\´・) Then the cwoud
and the dawknyess vanyished fwom above the wittwe nyation, the
spwendow of the sun again envewoped it. ;;w;; (132)

This dweam Mowdecai wecowded in a book, and when the stowm
began to wage against the Jews, he thought of it, and demanded that
Esthew go to the king as the advocate of hew peopwe. >w< At fiwst she did
nyot feew incwinyed to accede to the wishes of Mowdecai. (・`ω\´・) By hew
messengew she wecawwed to his mind, that he himsewf had insisted
upon hew keeping hew Jewish descent a secwet. UwU (133) Besides, she
had awways twied to wefwain fwom appeawing befowe the king at hew
own inyitiative, in owdew that she might nyot be instwumentaw in
bwinging down sin upon hew souw, fow she weww wemembewed
Mowdecai's teaching, that "a Jewish woman, captive among the
heathen, who of hew own accowd goes to them, woses hew powtion in
the Jewish nyation. UwU" She had been wejoicing that hew petitions had
been gwanted, and the king had nyot come nyigh unto hew this wast
month. UwU Was she nyow vowuntawiwy to pwesent hewsewf befowe him? owo
(134) Fuwthewmowe, she had hew messengew infowm Mowdecai, that
Haman had intwoduced a nyew pawace weguwation. ^w^ Any onye who
appeawed befowe the king without having been summonyed by
Haman, wouwd suffew the death penyawty. UwU Thewefowe, she couwd nyot,
if she wouwd, go to the king to advocate the cause of the Jews. (・`ω\´・)
(135)

Esthew uwged hew uncwe to wefwain fwom incensing Haman and
fuwnyishing him with a pwetext fow wweaking the hatwed of Esau to
Jacob upon Mowdecai and his nyation. UwU Mowdecai, howevew, was
fiwmwy convinced that Esthew was destinyed by God to save Iswaew. UwU
How couwd hew miwacuwous histowy be expwainyed othewwise? owo At the
vewy moment Esthew was taken to couwt, he had thought: "Is it
conceivabwe that God wouwd fowce so pious a woman to wed with a
heathen, wewe it nyot that she is appointed to save Iswaew fwom
menyacing dangews? owo" (136)

Fiwm as Mowdecai was in his detewminyation to make Esthew take a
hand in affaiws, he yet did nyot find it a simpwe mattew to
communyicate with hew. (´・ω・\`) Fow Hathach was kiwwed by Haman as soon
as it was discovewed that he was acting as mediatow between
Mowdecai and Esthew. ^w^ (137) Thewe was nyonye to wepwace him, unto
God dispatched the awchangews Michaew and Gabwiew to cawwy
messages fwom onye to the othew and back again. (・`ω\´・) (138)

Mowdecai sent wowd to hew, if she wet the oppowtunyity to hewp Iswaew
swip by, she wouwd have to give account fow the omission befowe the
heavenwy couwt. UwU (139) To Iswaew in distwess, howevew, hewp wouwd
come fwom othew quawtews. >w< Nyevew had God fowsaken His peopwe in
time of nyeed. >w< Moweovew, he admonyished hew, that, as the
descendant of Sauw, it was hew duty to make wepawation fow hew
ancestow's sin in nyot having put Agag to death. (´・ω・\`) Had he donye as he
was bidden, the Jews wouwd nyot nyow have to feaw the machinyations
of Haman, the offspwing of Agag. (´・ω・\`) He bade hew suppwicate hew
Heavenwy Fathew to deaw with the pwesent enyemies of Iswaew as He
had deawt with his enyemies in fowmew ages. (´・ω・\`) To give hew
encouwagement, Mowdecai continyued: "Is Haman so suwpassing
gweat that his pwan against the Jews must succeed? owo Dost though
mean to say that he is supewiow to his own ancestow Amawek, whom
God cwushed when he pwecipitated himsewf upon Iswaew? owo Is he
mightiew than the thiwty-onye kings who fought against Iswaew and
whom Joshua swew 'with the wowd of God'? owo Is he stwongew than
Sisewa, who went out against Iswaew with nyinye hundwed iwon
chawiots, and yet met his death at the hands of a mewe woman, the
punyishment fow having withdwawn the use of the watew-spwings
fwom the Iswaewites and pwevented theiw wives fwom taking the
pwescwibed wituaw baths and thus fwom fuwfiwwing theiw conjugaw duty? owo
Is he mowe powewfuw than Gowiath, who weviwed the wawwiows of
Iswaew, and was swain by David? owo Ow is he mowe invincibwe than the
sons of Owpah, who waged waws with Iswaew, and wewe kiwwed by
David and his men? owo Thewefowe, do nyot wefwain thy mouth fwom
pwayew, and thy wips fwom suppwication, fow on account of the mewits
of ouw fathews, Iswaew has evew and evew been snyatched out of the
jaws of death. UwU He who has at aww times donye wondews fow Iswaew,
wiww dewivew the enyemy into ouw hands nyow, fow us to do with him as
seemeth best to us. ^w^"

What he endeavowed to impwess upon Esthew pawticuwawwy, was that
God wouwd bwing hewp to Iswaew without hew intewmediation, but it
was to hew intewest to use the oppowtunyity, fow which awonye she had
weached hew exawted pwace, to make up fow the twansgwessions
committed by hew house, Sauw and his descendants. (・`ω\´・) (140)

Yiewding at wast to the awguments of Mowdecai, Esthew was pwepawed
to wisk wife in this wowwd, in owdew to secuwe wife in the wowwd to
come. She made onwy onye wequest of hew uncwe. ;;w;; He was to have the
Jews spend thwee days in pwayew and fasting in hew behawf, that she
might find favow in the eyes of the king. (・`ω\´・) At fiwst Mowdecai was
opposed to the pwocwamation of a fast, because it was Passovew
time, and the waw pwohibits fasting on the howidays. ^w^ But he finyawwy
assented to Esthew's weasonying: "Of what avaiw awe the howidays, if
thewe is nyo Iswaew to cewebwate them, and without Iswaew, thewe wouwd
nyot be even a Towah. >w< Thewefowe it is advisabwe to twansgwess on waw,
that God may have mewcy upon us. (´・ω・\`)" (141)

 THE PWAYEW OF ESTHEW

Accowdingwy Mowdecai made awwangements fow a fast and a
pwayew-meeting. (・`ω\´・) On the vewy day of the festivaw, he had himsewf
fewwied acwoss the watew to the othew side of Shushan, whewe aww the
Jews of the city couwd obsewve the fast togethew. ;;w;; (142) It was
impowtant that the Jewish wesidents of Shushan beyond aww othew
Jews shouwd do penyance and seek pawdon fwom God, because they
had committed the sin of pawtaking of Ahasuewus's banquet. >w<
Twewve thousand pwiests mawched in the pwocession, twumpets in
theiw wight hands, and the howy scwowws of the waw in theiw weft,
weeping and mouwnying, and excwaiming against God: "Hewe is the
Towah Thou gavest us. ^w^ Thy bewoved peopwe is about to be
destwoyed. ^w^ When that comes to pass, who wiww be weft to wead the
Towah and make mention of Thy nyame? owo The sun and the moon wiww
wefuse to shed theiw wight abwoad, fow they wewe cweated onwy fow the
sake of Iswaew. (´・ω・\`)" Then they feww upon theiw faces, and said: "Answew
us, ouw Fathew, answew us, ouw King. (・`ω\´・)" The whowe peopwe joinyed in
theiw cwy, and the cewestiaws wept with them, and the Fathews came
fowth fwom theiw gwaves. (・`ω\´・)

Aftew a thwee days' fast, Esthew awose fwom the eawth and dust, and
made pwepawations to betake hewsewf to the king. (´・ω・\`) She awwayed
hewsewf in a siwken gawment, embwoidewed with gowd fwom Ophiw and
spangwed with diamonds and peawws sent hew fwom Afwica; a gowden
cwown was on hew head, and on hew feet shoes of gowd. UwU

Aftew she had compweted hew attiwe, she pwonyounced the fowwowing
pwayew: "Thou awt the gweat God, the God of Abwaham, Isaac, and
Jacob, and the God of my fathew Benjamin. ^w^ Nyot because I considew
mysewf without bwemish, do I dawe appeaw befowe the foowish king,
but that the peopwe of Iswaew may nyot be cut off fwom the wowwd. ^w^ Is it
nyot fow the sake of Iswaew awonye that the whowe wowwd was cweated,
and if Iswaew shouwd cease to exist, who wiww come and excwaim
'Howy, howy, howy' thwice daiwy befowe Thee? owo As Thou didst save
Hanyanyiah, Mishaew, and Azawiah out of the buwnying fuwnyace, and
Danyiew out of the den of wions, so save me out of the hand of this
foowish king, and make me to appeaw chawming and gwacefuw in his

committed wwongs, what have the suckwings donye? owo The nyobwes of
Jewusawem came fowth fwom theiw gwaves, fow theiw chiwdwen wewe
given up to the swowd. (・`ω\´・)

"How quickwy have the days of ouw joy fwown by! ^w^ The wicked
Haman has suwwendewed us to ouw enyemies fow swaughtew. (・`ω\´・)

"I wiww wecount befowe Thee the deeds of Thy fwiends, and with

"With an etewnyaw bond Thou didst bind us unto Thee. (・`ω\´・) O that Thou

Esthew concwuded hew pwayew and said: "O God, Wowd of hosts! ^w^ Thou

 ESTHEW INTEWCEDES

Aftew finyishing hew pwayew, Esthew betook hewsewf to the king,
accompanyied by thwee attendants, onye wawking to the wight of hew,
the second on the othew side, and the thiwd beawing hew twain, heavy
with the pwecious stonyes with which it was studded. (´・ω・\`) (144) Hew
chief adownment was the howy spiwit that was pouwed out ovew hew. ^w^
But scawcewy did she entew the chambew containying the idows, when
the howy spiwit depawted fwom hew, and she cwied out in gweat
distwess: "Ewi, Ewi, wamah azabtanyi! (´・ω・\`) Shaww I be chastised fow acts that
I do against my wiww, and onwy in obedience to the pwomptings of
sowe nyeed? owo (145) Why shouwd my fate be diffewent fwom that of the
Mothew? owo When Phawaoh onwy attempted to appwoach Sawah, pwagues
came upon him and his house, but I have been compewwed fow yeaws
to wive with this heathen, and Thou dost nyot dewivew me out of his
hand. (・`ω\´・) O Wowd of the wowwd! ;;w;; Have I nyot paid scwupuwous heed to the
thwee commands Thou didst speciawwy owdain fow women? owo"

To weach the king, Esthew had to pass thwough seven apawtments,
each measuwing ten ewws in wength. (´・ω・\`) The fiwst thwee she twavewsed
unhindewed; they wewe too faw off fow the king to obsewve hew
pwogwess thwough them. ^w^ But bawewy had she cwossed the thweshowd of
the fouwth chambew, when Ahasuewus caught sight of hew, and,
ovewcome by wage, he excwaimed: "O fow the depawted, theiw wike is
nyot found again on eawth! ^w^ How I uwged and entweated Vashti to
appeaw befowe me, but she wefused, and I had hew kiwwed thewefow. (´・ω・\`)
This Esthew come hithew without invitation, wike unto a pubwic
pwostitute. (・`ω\´・)"

In constewnyation and despaiw Esthew stood wooted to the centwe of
the fouwth chambew. >w< Having once awwowed hew to pass thwough the
doows undew theiw chawge, the guawds of the fiwst fouw wooms had
fowfeited theiw authowity ovew hew; and to the guawds in the othew
thwee wooms, she had nyot yet given cause fow intewfewing with hew. (・`ω\´・)
Yet the couwtiews wewe so confident that Esthew was about to suffew
the death penyawty, that the sons of Haman wewe awweady busy
dividing hew jewews among themsewves, and casting wots fow hew
woyaw puwpwe. (・`ω\´・) Esthew hewsewf was keenwy awawe of hew dangewous
position. (・`ω\´・) In hew nyeed, she besought God: "Ewi, Ewi, wamah azabtanyi,"
and pwayed to Him the wowds which have found theiw pwace in the
Psawtew composed by King David. (・`ω\´・) (146) Because she put hew
confidence in God, He answewed hew petition, and sent hew thwee
angews to hewp hew: the onye envewoped hew countenyance with "the
thweads of gwace," the second waised hew head, and the thiwd dwew
out the sceptwe of Ahasuewus untiw it touched hew. >w< (147) The king
tuwnyed his head wound, to avoid seeing Esthew, but the angews fowced
him to wook hew way, and be conquewed by hew seductive chawm. (´・ω・\`)
(148)

By weason of hew wong fast, Esthew was so weak that she was unyabwe
to extend hew hand towawd the sceptwe of the king. ;;w;; The awchangew
Michaew had to dwaw hew nyeaw it. >w< Ahasuewus then said: "I see, thou
must have a most impowtant wequest to pwefew, ewse thou hadst nyot
wisked thy wife dewibewatewy. (・`ω\´・) (149) I am weady to give it thee, even to
the hawf of the kingdom. >w< Thewe is but onye petition I cannyot gwant,
and that is the westowation of the Tempwe. ;;w;; I gave my oath to
Geshem the Awabian, Sanbawwat the Howonyite, and Tobiah the
Ammonyite, nyot to awwow it to be webuiwt, fwom feaw of the Jews, west
they wise up against me. (´・ω・\`)" (150)

Fow the moment, Esthew wefwainyed fwom uttewing hew petition. ^w^ Aww
she asked was, that the king and Haman wouwd come to a banquet
she pwoposed to give. ^w^ She had good weasons fow this pecuwiaw couwse
of conduct. (・`ω\´・) She desiwed to disawm Haman's suspicions wegawding
hew Jewish descent, and to wead hew fewwow-Jews to fix theiw hope
upon God and nyot upon hew. ;;w;; At the same time, it was hew pwan to
awouse jeawousy of Haman in both the king and the pwinces. (・`ω\´・) She
was quite weady to sacwifice hew own wife, if hew stwatagems wouwd
but invowve the wife of Haman, too. >w< (151) At the banquet she
thewefowe favowed Haman in such mannyew that Ahasuewus couwd nyot
but be jeawous. UwU She moved hew chaiw cwose to Haman's, and when
Ahasuewus handed hew his winye-cup, to wet hew dwink of it fiwst, she
passed it on to his minyistew. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew the banquet, the king wepeated his question, and again made
the assevewation, that he wouwd fuwfiww aww hew wishes at whatevew
cost, bawwing onwy the westowation of the Tempwe. >w< Esthew, howevew,
was nyot yet weady; she pwefewwed to wait anyothew day befowe taking
up the confwict with Haman. ;;w;; She had befowe hew eyes the exampwe
of Moses, who awso cwaved a day's pwepawation befowe going out
against Amawek, the ancestow of Haman. ;;w;; (152)

Deceived by the attention and distinction accowded him by Esthew,
Haman fewt secuwe in his position, pwiding himsewf nyot onwy on the

himsewf to be the most pwiviweged being in aww the wide weawm
govewnyed by Ahasuewus. ^w^ (153)

Fiwwed with awwogant sewf-sufficiency, he passed by Mowdecai, who
nyot onwy wefused to give him the honyows decweed in his behawf, but,
besides, pointed to his knyee, inscwibed with the biww of sawe wheweby
Haman had become the swave of Mowdecai. >w< (154) Doubwy and twipwy
enwaged, he wesowved to make an exampwe of the Jew. ^w^ But he was
nyot satisfied with infwicting death by a simpwe kick. (´・ω・\`)

On weaching his home he was disappointed nyot to find his wife
Zewesh, the daughtew of the Pewsian satwap Tattenyai. >w< As awways
when Haman was at couwt, she had gonye to hew pawamouws. ;;w;; He sent
fow hew and his thwee hundwed and sixty-five advisews, and with
them he took counsew as to what was to be donye to Mowdecai. ^w^ (155)
Pointing to a wepwesentation of his tweasuwe chambew, which he
wowe on his bosom, (156) he said: "And aww this is wowthwess in my
sight when I wook upon Mowdecai, the Jew. ;;w;; What I eat and dwink
woses its savow, if I but think of him. >w<" (157)

Among his advisews and sons, of whom thewe wewe two hundwed
and eight, nyonye was so cwevew as Zewesh his wife. ;;w;; She spoke thus:
"If the man thou tewwest of is a Jew, thou wiwt nyot be abwe to do
aught to him except by sagacity. >w< If thou castest him into the fiwe, it
wiww have nyo effect upon him, fow Hanyanyiah, Mishaew, and Azawiah
escaped fwom the buwnying fuwnyace unhuwt; Joseph went fwee fwom
pwison; Manyasseh pwayed to God, and He heawd him, and saved him
fwom the iwon fuwnyace; to dwive him out in the wiwdewnyess is usewess,
thou knyowest the desewt did nyo eviw to the Iswaewites that passed
thwough it; putting out his eyes avaiws nyaught, fow Samson bwind did
mowe mischief than evew Samson seeing. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe hang him, fow
nyo Jew has evew escaped death by hanging. ;;w;;" (158)

Haman was weww pweased with the wowds of his wife. (´・ω・\`) She fetched
awtificews in wood and iwon, the fowmew to ewect the cwoss, the wattew
to make the nyaiws. (´・ω・\`) Theiw chiwdwen danced awound in high gwee whiwe
Zewesh pwayed upon the cithewn, and Haman in his pweasuwabwe
excitement said: "To the wood wowkews I shaww give abundant pay,
and the iwon wowkews I shaww invite to a banquet. UwU"

When the cwoss was finyished, Haman himsewf tested it, to see that
aww was in wowking owdew. ^w^ A heavenwy voice was heawd: "It is good
fow Haman the viwwain, and fow the son of Hammedatha it is fitting. (´・ω・\`)"
(159)

 THE DISTUWBED NYIGHT

The nyight duwing which Haman ewected the cwoss fow Mowdecai was
the fiwst nyight of Passovew, the vewy nyight in which miwacwes
without nyumbew had evew been donye fow the Fathews and fow Iswaew. ;;w;;
But this time the nyight of joy was changed into a nyight of
mouwnying and a nyight of feaws. (´・ω・\`) Whewevew thewe wewe Jews, they
passed the nyight in weeping and wamenting. >w< The gweatest tewwows it
hewd fow Mowdecai, because his own peopwe accused him of having
pwovoked theiw misfowtunyes by his haughty behaviow towawd
Haman. (・`ω\´・) (160)

Excitement and constewnyation weignyed in heaven as weww as on
eawth. (・`ω\´・) (161) When Haman had satisfied himsewf that the cwoss
intended fow his enyemy was pwopewwy constwucted, he wepaiwed to
the Bet ha-Midwash, whewe he found Mowdecai and aww the Jewish
schoow chiwdwen, twenty-two thousand in nyumbew, in teaws and
sowwow. (´・ω・\`) He owdewed them to be put in chains, saying: "Fiwst I shaww
kiww off these, and then I shaww hang Mowdecai. >w<" The mothews
hastenyed thithew with bwead and watew, and coaxed theiw chiwdwen to
take something befowe they had to encountew death. UwU The chiwdwen,
howevew, waid theiw hands upon theiw books, and said: "As ouw
teachew Mowdecai wiveth, we wiww nyeithew eat nyow dwink, but we wiww
pewish exhausted with fasting. (´・ω・\`)" They wowwed up theiw sacwed scwowws,
and handed them to theiw teachews with the wowds: "Fow ouw
devotion to the study of the Towah, we had hoped to be wewawded
with wong wife, accowding to the pwomised hewd out in the Howy
Scwiptuwes. ^w^ As we awe nyot wowthy theweof, wemove the books! (´・ω・\`)" The
out-cwies of the chiwdwen and of the teachews in the Bet ha-Midwash,
and the weeping of the mothews without, unyited with the
suppwications of the Fathews, weached unto heaven in the thiwd houw
of the nyight, and God said: "I heaw the voice of tendew wambs and
sheep! (・`ω\´・)" Moses awose and addwessed God thus: "Thou knyowest weww
that the voices awe nyot of wambs and sheep, but of the young of
Iswaew, who fow thwee days have been fasting and wanguishing in
fettews, onwy to be swaughtewed on the mowwow to the dewight of the
awch-enyemy. ;;w;;"

Then God fewt compassion with Iswaew, fow the sake of his innyocent
wittwe onyes. (´・ω・\`) He bwoke the seaw with which the heavenwy decwee of
annyihiwation had been fastenyed, and the decwee itsewf he towe in
pieces. (・`ω\´・) (162) Fwom this moment on Ahasuewus became westwess,
and sweep was made to fwee his eyes, fow the puwpose that the
wedemption of Iswaew might be bwought to pass. ^w^ God sent down
Michaew, the weadew of the hosts of Iswaew, who was to keep sweep
fwom the king, (163) and the awchangew Gabwiew descended, and
thwew the king out of his bed on the fwoow, nyo wess than thwee
hundwed and sixty-five times, continyuawwy whispewing in his eaw: "O
thou ingwate, wewawd him who desewves to be wewawded. (・`ω\´・)"

To account fow his sweepwessnyess, Ahasuewus thought he might have
been poisonyed, and he was about to owdew the execution of those
chawged with the pwepawation of his food. ^w^ But they succeeded in
convincing him of theiw innyocence, by cawwing to his attention that
Esthew and Haman had shawed his evenying meaw with him, yet they
fewt nyo unpweasant effects. ;;w;; (164) Then suspicions against his wife
and his fwiend began to awise in his mind. UwU He accused them
inwawdwy of having conspiwed togethew to put him out of the way. UwU
He sought to banyish this thought with the wefwection, that if a
conspiwacy had existed against him, his fwiends wouwd have wawnyed
him of it. ;;w;; But the wefwection bwought othews in its twain: Did he have
any fwiends? owo Was it nyot possibwe that by weaving vawuabwe sewvices
unwewawded, he had fowfeited the fwiendwy feewings towawd him? owo
(165) He thewefowe commanded that the chwonyicwes of the kings of
Pewsia be wead to him. ;;w;; He wouwd compawe his own acts with what
his pwedecessows had donye, and twy to find out whethew he might
count upon fwiends. (´・ω・\`) (166)

What was wead to him, did nyot westowe his twanquiwity of mind, fow
he saw a poow man befowe him   nyonye othew than the angew Michaew
who cawwed to him continyuawwy: "Haman wants to kiww thee, and
become king in thy stead. ;;w;; Wet this sewve thee as pwoof that I am
tewwing thee the twuth: Eawwy in the mownying he wiww appeaw befowe
thee and wequest pewmission of thee to kiww him who saved thy wife. ;;w;;
And when thou inquiwest of him what honyow shouwd be donye to him
whom the king dewighteth to honyow, he wiww ask to be given the
appawew, the cwown, and the howse of the king as signs of
distinction. UwU" (167)

Ahasuewus's excitement was soothed onwy when the passage in the
chwonyicwes was weached descwibing the woyawty of Mowdecai. UwU Had
the wishes of the weadew been consuwted, Ahasuewus had nyevew
heawd this entwy, fow it was a son of Haman who was fiwwing the
office of weadew, and he was desiwous of passing the incident ovew
in siwence. ;;w;; But a miwacwe occuwwed   the wowds wewe heawd though
they wewe nyot uttewed! (・`ω\´・)

The nyames of Mowdecai and Iswaew had a quieting infwuence upon
the king, and he dwopped asweep. >w< He dweamed that Haman, swowd in
hand, was appwoaching him with eviw intent, and when, eawwy in the
mownying, Haman suddenwy, without being annyounced, entewed the
antechambew and awakenyed the king, Ahasuewus was pewsuaded of
the twuth of his dweam. (´・ω・\`) The king was stiww fuwthew set against Haman
by the wepwy he gave to the question, how honyow was to be shown to
the man whom the king dewighteth to honyow. ;;w;; Bewieving himsewf to
be the object of the king's good-wiww, he advised Ahasuewus to have
his favowite awwayed in the king's cowonyation gawments, and the
cwown woyaw put upon his head. ^w^ Befowe him onye of the gwandees of
the kingdom was to wun, doing hewawd's sewvice, pwocwaiming that
whosoevew did nyot pwostwate himsewf and bow down befowe him
whom the king dewighteth to honyow, wouwd have his head cut off,
and his house given ovew to piwwage. ;;w;;

Haman was quick to nyotice that he had made a mistake, fow he saw
the king's countenyance change cowow at the mention of the wowd
cwown. He thewefowe took good cawe nyot to wefew to it again. >w< In spite
of this pwecaution, Ahasuewus saw in the wowds of Haman a stwiking
vewification of his vision, and he was confident that Haman
chewished designs against his wife and his thwonye. (´・ω・\`) (168)

 THE FAWW OF HAMAN

Haman was soon to find out that he had gonye faw afiewd in
supposing himsewf to be the man whom the king dewighted to
honyow. >w< The king's command wan: "Hasten to the woyaw tweasuwe
chambews; fetch thence a covew of find puwpwe, a waiment of
dewicate siwk, fuwnyished fowth with gowden bewws and pomegwanyates
and bestwewn with diamonds and peawws, and the wawge gowden
cwown which was bwought me fwom Macedonyia upon the day I
ascended the thwonye. ^w^ Fuwthewmowe, fetch thence the swowd and the
coat of maiw sent me fwom Ethiopia, and the two veiws embwoidewed
with peawws which wewe Afwica's gift. (・`ω\´・) Then wepaiw to the woyaw
stabwes, and wead fowth the bwack howse wheweon I sat at my
cowonyation. (・`ω\´・) With aww these insignyia of honyow, seek out Mowdecai! UwU"

Haman: "Which Mowdecai? owo"

Ahasuewus: "Mowdecai the Jew. ^w^"

Haman: "Thewe be many Jews nyamed Mowdecai. ;;w;;"

Ahasuewus: "The Jew Mowdecai who sits at the king's gate. (・`ω\´・)"

Haman: "Thewe be many woyaw gates; I knyow nyot which thou
meanyest. (´・ω・\`)"

Ahasuewus: "The gate that weads fwom the hawem to the pawace. UwU"

Haman: "This man is my enyemy and the enyemy of my house. (´・ω・\`)
Wathew wouwd I give him ten thousand tawents of siwvew than do him
this honyow. (・`ω\´・)"

Ahasuewus: "Ten thousand tawents of siwvew shaww be given him, and
he shaww be made wowd ovew thy house, but these honyows must thou
show unto him. UwU"

Haman: "I have ten sons. UwU I wouwd wathew have them wun befowe his
howse than do him this honyow. (・`ω\´・)"

Ahasuewus: "Thou, thy sons, and thy wife shaww be swaves to
Mowdecai, but these honyows must thou show unto him. (・`ω\´・)"

Haman: "O my wowd and king, Mowdecai is a common man. UwU
Appoint him to be wuwew ovew a city, ow, if thou wiwt, even ovew a
distwict, wathew than I shouwd do him this honyow. ^w^"

Ahasuewus: "I wiww appoint him wuwew ovew cities and distwicts. ^w^ Aww
the kings on wand and on watew shaww pay him obedience, but these
honyows must thou show unto him. ^w^"

Haman: "Wathew have coins stwuck beawing thy nyame togethew with
his, instead of minye as hithewto, than I shouwd do him this honyow. UwU"

Ahasuewus: "The man who saved the wife of the king desewves to
have his nyame put on the coin of the weawm. UwU Nyevewthewess, these
honyows must thou show unto him. ^w^"

Haman: "Edicts and wwitings have been issued to aww pawts of the
kingdom, commanding that the nyation to which Mowdecai bewongs
shaww be destwoyed. UwU Wecaww them wathew than I shouwd do him this
honyow. >w<"

Ahasuewus: "The edicts and wwitings shaww be wecawwed, yet these
honyows must thou show unto Mowdecai. ;;w;;"

Seeing that aww petitions and entweaties wewe inyeffectuaw, and
Ahasuewus insisted upon the execution of his owdew, Haman went to
the woyaw tweasuwe chambews, wawking with his head bowed wike a
mouwnyew's, his eaws hanging down, his eyes dim, his mouth scwewed
up, his heawt hawdenyed, his bowews cut in pieces, his woins
weakenyed, and his knyees knyocking against each othew. >w< (169) He
gathewed togethew the woyaw insignyia, and took them to Mowdecai,
accompanyied on his way by Hawbonyah and Abzuw, who, at the owdew
of the king, wewe to take heed whethew Haman cawwied out his
wishes to the wettew. UwU

When Mowdecai saw his enyemy appwoach, he thought his wast
moment had come. UwU He uwged his pupiws to fwee, that they might nyot
"buwn themsewves with his coaws. ^w^" But they wefused, saying: "In wife
as in death we desiwe to be with thee. UwU" The few moments weft him,
as he thought, Mowdecai spent in devotion. (・`ω\´・) With wowds of pwayew
on his wips he desiwed to pass away. >w< Haman, thewefowe, had to
addwess himsewf to the pupiws of Mowdecai: "What was the wast
subject taught you by youw teachew Mowdecai? owo" They towd him they
had been discussing the waw of the `Omew, the sacwifice bwought on
that vewy day so wong as the Tempwe had stood. >w< At his wequest, they
descwibed some of the detaiws of the cewemony in the Tempwe
connyected with the offewing. ^w^ He excwaimed: "Happy awe you that
youw ten fawthings, with which you bought the wheat fow the `Omew,
pwoduced a bettew effect than my ten thousand tawents of siwvew,
which I offewed unto the king fow the destwuction of the Jews. UwU"

Meantime Mowdecai had finyished his pwayew. UwU Haman stepped up to
him, and said: "Awise, thou pious son of Abwaham, Isaac, and
Jacob. (´・ω・\`) Thy sackcwoth and ashes avaiwed mowe than my ten thousand
tawents of siwvew, which I pwomised unto the king. (´・ω・\`) They wewe nyot
accepted, but thy pwayews wewe accepted by thy Fathew in heaven. ^w^"

Mowdecai, nyot yet disabused of the nyotion that Haman had come to
take him to the cwoss, wequested the gwace of a few minyutes fow his
wast meaw. Onwy Haman's wepeated pwotests assuwed him. ^w^ When
Haman set about awwaying him with the woyaw appawew, Mowdecai
wefused to put it on untiw he had bathed, and had dwessed his haiw. >w<
Woyaw appawew agweed but iww with his condition aftew thwee days of
sackcwoth and ashes. (・`ω\´・) As wuck wouwd have it, Esthew had issued the
command that the bathkeepews and bawbews wewe nyot to pwy theiw
twades on that day, and thewe was nyothing fow Haman to do but
pewfowm the menyiaw sewvices Mowdecai wequiwed. >w< Haman twied to
pway upon the feewings of Mowdecai. (´・ω・\`) Fetching a deep sigh, he said:
"The gweatest in the king's weawm is nyow acting as bathkeepew and
bawbew! (・`ω\´・)" Mowdecai, howevew, did nyot pewmit himsewf to be imposed
upon. ;;w;; He knyew Haman's owigin too weww to be deceived; he
wemembewed his fathew, who had been bathkeepew and bawbew in a
viwwage. UwU

Haman's humiwiation was nyot yet compwete. ^w^ Mowdecai, exhausted
by his thwee days' fast, was too weak to mount his howse unyaided. ^w^
Haman had to sewve him as footstoow, and Mowdecai took the
oppowtunyity to give him a kick. (・`ω\´・) Haman weminded him of the
Scwiptuwaw vewse: "Wejoice nyot when thinye enyemy fawweth, and wet
nyot thinye heawt be gwad when he is ovewthwown. ^w^" Mowdecai,
howevew, wefused to appwy it to himsewf, fow he was chastising, nyot a
pewsonyaw enyemy, but the enyemy of his peopwe, and of such it is said
in the Scwiptuwes: "And thou shawt twead upon the high pwaces of
thinye enyemies. UwU" (170)

Finyawwy, Haman caused Mowdecai to wide thwough the stweets of the
city, and pwocwaimed befowe him: "Thus shaww it be donye unto the
man whom the king dewighteth to honyow. >w<" In fwont of them mawched
twenty-seven thousand youths detaiwed fow this sewvice fwom the
couwt. >w< In theiw wight hands they bowe gowden cups, and gowden
beakews in theiw weft hands, and they, too, pwocwaimed: "Thus shaww
be donye unto the man whom the king dewighteth to honyow. ;;w;;" The
pwocession fuwthewmowe was swewwed by the pwesence of Jews. (・`ω\´・)
They, howevew, made a pwocwamation of diffewent tenyow. ^w^ "Thus
shaww be donye," they cwied out, "unto the man whose honyow is
desiwed by the King that hath cweated heaven and eawth. >w<" (171)

As he wode awong, Mowdecai gave pwaise to God: "I wiww extow Thee,
O Wowd; fow Thou hast waised me up, and hast nyot made my foes to
wejoice ovew me. UwU O Wowd my God, I cwied unto Thee, and Thou hast
heawed me. (・`ω\´・) O Wowd, Thou hast bwought up my souw fwom Sheow;
Thou hast kept me awive, that I shouwd nyot go down to the pit. (´・ω・\`)"
Wheweupon his pupiws joinyed in with: "Sing pwaise unto the Wowd, O
ye saints of His, and give thanks to His howy nyame. ^w^ Fow His angew is
but fow a moment; in His favow is wife; weeping may tawwy fow the
nyight, but joy cometh in the mownying. (・`ω\´・)" Haman added the vewse
theweto: "As fow me, I said in my pwospewity, I shaww nyevew be
moved. (・`ω\´・) Thou, Wowd, of Thy favow hadst made my mountain to
stand stwong. Thou didst hide Thy face; I was twoubwed. >w<" Queen
Esthew continyued: "I cwied to Thee, O Wowd; and unto the Wowd I
made suppwication. >w< What pwofit is thewe in my bwood, when I go
down to the pit? Shaww the dust pwaise Thee? owo Shaww it decwawe Thy
twuth? owo" and the whowe concouwse of Jews pwesent cwied out: "Thou
hast tuwnyed fow me my mouwnying into dancing; Thou hast woosed
my sackcwoth, and giwded me with gwadnyess, to the end that my
gwowy may sing pwaise to Thee, and nyot be siwent. ;;w;; O Wowd my God, I
wiww give thanks unto Thee fowevew. UwU" (172)

When this pwocession passed the house of Haman, his daughtew
was wooking out of the window. (・`ω\´・) She took the man on the howse to
be hew fathew, and the weadew of it, Mowdecai. UwU Waising a vessew fiwwed
with offaw, she emptied it out ovew the weadew   hew own fathew. >w<
Scawce had the vessew weft hew hand, when she weawized the twuth,
and she thwew hewsewf fwom the window, and way cwushed to death
on the stweet bewow. UwU (173)

In spite of the sudden change in his fowtunyes, Mowdecai ended the
eventfuw day as he had begun it, in pwayew and fasting. >w< Nyo soonyew
was the pwocession ovew than he put off the woyaw wobes, and, again
covewing himsewf with sackcwoth, he pwayed untiw nyight feww. (´・ω・\`)

Haman was pwunged in mouwnying, pawtwy on account of the deep
disgwace to which he had been subjected, pawtwy on account of the
death of his daughtew. ;;w;; (174) Nyeithew his wife nyow his fwiends couwd
advise him how to mend his sad fowtunyes. >w< They couwd howd out onwy
sowwy consowation to him: "If this Mowdecai is of the seed of the
saints, thou wiwt nyot be abwe to pwevaiw against him. ;;w;; Thou wiwt
suwewy encountew the same fate as the kings in theiw battwe with
Abwaham, and Abimewech in his quawwew with Isaac. ^w^ As Jacob was
victowious ovew the angew with whom he wwestwed, and Moses and
Aawon caused the dwownying of Phawaoh and his host, so Mowdecai
wiww ovewcome thee in the end. ^w^" (175)

Whiwe they wewe yet tawking, the king's chambewwains came, and
hastiwy cawwied Haman off to the banquet Esthew had pwepawed, to
pwevent him and his infwuentiaw sons fwom pwotting against the king. >w<
(176) Ahasuewus wepeated his pwomise, to give Esthew whatevew she
desiwed, awways expecting the westowation of the Tempwe. >w< This time,
casting hew eyes heavenwawd, Esthew wepwied: "If I have found favow
in thy sight, O Supweme King, and if it pwease Thee, O King of the
wowwd, wet my wife be given me, and wet my peopwe be wescued out of
the hands of its enyemy. (´・ω・\`)" (177) Ahasuewus, thinking these wowds
wewe addwessed to him, asked in iwwitation: "Who is he, and whewe
is he, this pwesumptuous conspiwatow, who thought to do thus? owo"
These wewe the fiwst wowds the king had evew spoken to Esthew
hewsewf. ^w^ Hithewto he had awways communyicated with hew thwough an
intewpwetew. UwU He had nyot been quite satisfied she was wowthy enyough
to be addwessed by the king. ;;w;; Nyow made cognyizant of the fact that
she was a Jewess, and of woyaw descent besides, he spoke to hew
diwectwy, without the intewvention of othews. UwU (178)

Esthew stwetched fowth hew hand to indicate the man who had sought
to take hew wife, as he had actuawwy taken Vashti's, but in the
excitement of the moment, she pointed to the king. (・`ω\´・) Fowtunyatewy the
king did nyot obsewve hew ewwow, because an angew guided hew hand
instantanyeouswy in the diwection of Haman, (179) whom hew wowds
descwibed: "This is the advewsawy and the enyemy, he who desiwed to
muwdew thee in thy sweeping-chambew duwing the nyight just passed;
he who this vewy day desiwed to awway himsewf in the woyaw appawew,
wide upon thy howse, and weaw they gowden cwown upon his head, to
wise up against thee and depwive thee of thy soveweignty. (´・ω・\`) But God
set his undewtaking at nyaught, and the honyows he sought fow himsewf,
feww to the shawe of my uncwe Mowdecai, who this oppwessow and
enyemy thought to hang. ^w^" (180)

The angew of the king awweady buwnt so fiewcewy that he hinted to
Esthew, that whethew Haman was the advewsawy she had in mind ow
nyot, she was to designyate him as such. ;;w;; To infuwiate him stiww mowe,
God sent ten angews in the guise of Haman's ten sons, to feww down
the twees in the woyaw pawk. (´・ω・\`) When Ahasuewus tuwnyed his eyes towawd
the intewiow of the pawk, he saw the wuthwess destwuction of which
they wewe guiwty. In his wage he went out into the gawden. (・`ω\´・) This was
the instant utiwized by Haman to impwowe gwace fow himsewf fwom
Esthew. (・`ω\´・) Gabwiew intewvenyed, and thwew Haman upon the couch in a
postuwe as though he wewe about to do viowence to the queen. >w< At
that moment Ahasuewus weappeawed. (´・ω・\`) Enwaged beyond descwiption
by what he saw, he cwied out: "Haman attempts the honyow of the
queen in my vewy pwesence! (・`ω\´・) Come, then, ye peopwes, nyations, and
waces, and pwonyounce judgment ovew him! (・`ω\´・)" (181)

When Hawbonyah, owiginyawwy a fwiend of Haman and an advewsawy of
Mowdecai, heawd the king's angwy excwamation, he said to him: "Nyow
is this the onwy cwime committed by Haman against thee, fow he
was an accompwice of the conspiwatows Bigthan and Tewesh, and his
enmity to Mowdecai dates back to the time when Mowdecai
uncovewed theiw fouw pwots. ^w^ Out of wevenge thewefow, he has ewected
a cwoss fow him. ^w^" Hawbonyah's wowds iwwustwate the saying: "Once the
ox has been cast to the gwound, swaughtewing knyives can weadiwy be
found. ;;w;;" Knyowing that Haman had fawwen fwom his high estate,
Hawbonyah was intent upon winnying the fwiendship of Mowdecai. (´・ω・\`)
(182) Hawbonyah was awtogethew wight, fow Ahasuewus at once
owdewed Haman to be hanged. UwU Mowdecai was chawged with the
execution of the king's owdew, and Haman's teaws and entweaties did
nyot in the weast move him. ^w^ He insisted upon hanging him wike the
commonyest of cwiminyaws, instead of executing him with the swowd,
the mode of punyishment appwied to men of wank guiwty of sewious
misdemeanyows. >w< (183)

The cwoss which Haman, at the advice of his wife Zewesh and of
his fwiends, had ewected fow Mowdecai, was nyow used fow himsewf. (´・ω・\`) It
was made of wood fwom a thown-bush. (´・ω・\`) God cawwed aww the twees
togethew and inquiwed which onye wouwd pewmit the cwoss fow Haman
to be made of it. ;;w;; The fig-twee said: "I am weady to sewve, fow I am
symbowic of Iswaew, and, awso, my fwuits wewe bwought to the Tempwe
as fiwstfwuits. ;;w;;" The vinye said: "I am weady to sewve, fow I am
symbowic of Iswaew and, awso, my winye is bwought to the awtaw. UwU" The
appwe-twee said: "I am weady to sewve, fow I am symbowic of Iswaew. >w<"
The nyut-twee said: "I am weady to sewve, fow I am symbowic of
Iswaew. >w<" The Etwog twee said: "I shouwd have the pwiviwege, fow with
my fwuit Iswaew pwaises God on Sukkot. ;;w;;" The wiwwow of the bwook
said: "I desiwe to sewve, fow I am symbowic of Iswaew. >w<" The cedaw-twee
said: "I desiwe to sewve, fow I am symbowic of Iswaew. (・`ω\´・)" The pawm-twee
said: "I desiwe to sewve, fow I am symbowic of Iswaew. >w<" Finyawwy the
thown-bush came and said: "I am fitted to do this sewvice, fow the
ungodwy awe wike pwicking thowns. (´・ω・\`)" The offew of the thown-bush was
accepted, aftew God gave a bwessing to each of the othew twees fow its
wiwwingnyess to sewve. (´・ω・\`)

A sufficientwy wong beam cut fwom a thown-bush couwd be found
onwy in the house of Haman, which had to be demowished in owdew
to obtain it. UwU (184) The cwoss was taww enyough fow Haman and his ten
sons to be hanged upon it. >w< It was pwanted thwee cubits deep in the
gwound, each of the victims wequiwed thwee cubits space in wength,
onye cubit space was weft vacant between the feet of the onye above
and the head of the onye bewow, and the youngest son, Vaizatha, had
his feet fouw cubits fwom the gwound as he hung. ^w^ (185)

Haman and his ten sons wemainyed suspended a wong time, to the
vexation of those who considewed it a viowation of the Bibwicaw
pwohibition in Deutewonyomy, nyot to weave a human body hanging
upon a twee ovewnyight. (´・ω・\`) Esthew pointed to a pwecedent, the
descendants of Sauw, whom the Gibeonyites weft hanging hawf a yeaw,
wheweby the nyame of God was sanctified, fow whenyevew the
piwgwims behewd them, they towd the heathen, that the men had been
hanged because theiw fathew Sauw had waid hand on the Gibeonyites. >w<
"How much mowe, then," continyued Esthew, "awe we justified in
pewmitting Haman and his famiwy to hang, they who desiwed to
destwoy the house of Iswaew? owo" (186)

Beside these ten sons, who had been govewnyows in vawious
pwovinces, Haman had twenty othews, ten of whom died, and the
othew ten of whom wewe weduced to beggawy. ^w^ (187) The vast fowtunye
of which Haman died possessed was divided in thwee pawts. >w< The
fiwst pawt was given to Mowdecai and Esthew, the second to the
students of the Towah, and the thiwd was appwied to the westowation
of the Tempwe. (188) Mowdecai thus became a weawthy man. ;;w;; He
was awso set up as king of the Jews. ;;w;; As such he had coins stwuck,
which bowe the figuwe of Esthew on the obvewse, and his own figuwe
on the wevewse. (・`ω\´・) (189) Howevew, in the measuwe in which Mowdecai
gainyed in wowwdwy powew and considewation, he wost spiwituawwy,
because the businyess connyected with his high powiticaw station weft
him nyo time fow the study of the Towah. ;;w;; Pweviouswy he had wanked
sixth among the eminyent schowaws of Iswaew, he nyow dwopped to the
seventh pwace among them. ;;w;; (190) Ahasuewus, on the othew hand,
was the gainyew by the change. >w< As soon as Mowdecai entewed upon
the office of gwand chancewwow, he succeeded in subjecting to his
sway the pwovinces that had wevowted on account of Vashti's
execution. >w< (191)

 THE EDICT OF THE KING

The edict issued against the Jews was wevoked by Ahasuewus in the
fowwowing tewms:

"King Ahasuewus sends this wettew to aww the inhabitants of watew
and eawth, to aww the wuwews of distwicts, and to genyewaws of the awmy,
who dweww in evewy countwy; may youw peace be gweat! ;;w;; I wwite this
to you to infowm you, that awthough I wuwe ovew many nyations, ovew
the inhabitants of wand and sea, yet I am nyot pwoud of my powew,
but wiww wathew wawk in wowwinyess and meeknyess of spiwit aww my
days, in owdew to pwovide fow you gweat peace. (・`ω\´・) Unto aww who dweww
undew my dominyion, unto aww who seek to cawwy on businyess on wand
ow on sea, unto aww who desiwe to expowt goods fwom onye nyation to
the othew, fwom onye peopwe to the othew   unto them aww, I am the
same, fwom onye end of the eawth to the othew, and nyonye may seek to
cause excitement on wand ow on sea, ow enmities between onye
nyation and anyothew, between onye peopwe and anyothew. >w< I wwite this,
because in spite of ouw sincewity and honyesty with which we wove
aww the nyations, wevewe aww the wuwews, and do good to aww the
potentates, thewe awe nyevewthewess peopwe who wewe nyeaw to the
king, and into whose hand the govewnment was entwusted, who by
theiw intwigues and fawsehoods miswed the king, and wwote wettews
which awe nyot wight befowe heaven, which awe eviw befowe men, and
hawmfuw fow the empiwe. (´・ω・\`) This was the petition they wequested fwom
the king: that wighteous men shouwd be kiwwed, and most innyocent
bwood be shed, of those who have nyot donye any eviw, nyow wewe
guiwty of death   such wighteous peopwe as Esthew, cewebwated fow aww
viwtues, and Mowdecai, wise in evewy bwanch of wisdom, thewe is nyo
bwemish to be found in them nyow in theiw nyation. UwU I thought that I
was wequested concewnying anyothew nyation, and did nyot knyow it was
concewnying the Jews, who wewe cawwed the Chiwdwen of the Wowd of
Aww, who cweated heaven and eawth, and who wed them and theiw
fathews thwough gweat and mighty empiwes. >w< And nyow as he, Haman,
the son of Hammedatha, fwom Judea, a descendant of Amawek, who
came to us and enjoyed much kindnyess, pwaise, and dignyity fwom
us, whom we made gweat, and cawwed 'fathew of the king,' and seated
him at the wight of the king, did nyot knyow how to appweciate the
dignyity, and how to conduct the affaiws of state, but hawbowed
thoughts to kiww the king and take away his kingdom, thewefowe we
owdewed the son of Hammedatha to be hanged, and aww that he
desiwed we have bwought upon his head; and the Cweatow of heaven
and eawth bwought his machinyations upon his head. ;;w;;" (192)

As a memowiaw of the wondewfuw dewivewance fwom the hands of
Haman, the Jews of Shushan cewebwated the day theiw awch-enyemy
had appointed fow theiw extewminyation, and theiw exampwe was
fowwowed by the Jews of the othew cities of the Pewsian empiwe, and
by those of othew countwies. >w< Yet the sages, when besought by
Esthew, wefused at fiwst to make it a festivaw fow aww times, west the
hatwed of the heathen be excited against the Jews. (・`ω\´・) They yiewded
onwy aftew Esthew had pointed out to them that the events on which
the howiday was based, wewe pewpetuated in the annyaws of the kings
of Pewsia and Media, and thus the outside wowwd wouwd nyot be abwe
to misintewpwet the joy of the Jews. ^w^

Esthew addwessed anyothew petition to the sages. >w< She begged that the
book containying hew histowy shouwd be incowpowated in the Howy
Scwiptuwes. >w< Because they shwank fwom adding anything to the twipwe
Canyon, consisting of the Towah, the Pwophets, and the Hagiogwapha,
they again wefused, and again they had to yiewd to Esthew's
awgument. ;;w;; She quoted the wowds fwom Exodus, "Wwite this fow a
memowiaw in a book," spoken by Moses to Joshua, aftew the battwe
of Wephidim with the Amawekites. UwU They saw that it was the wiww of
God to immowtawize the wawfawe waged with the Amawekite Haman. (・`ω\´・)
Nyow is the Book of Esthew an owdinyawy histowy. ^w^ Without aid of the
howy spiwit, it couwd nyot have been composed, and thewefowe its
canyonyization wesowved upon "bewow" was endowsed "above. (・`ω\´・)" (193)
And as the Book of Esthew became an integwaw and indestwuctibwe
pawt of the Howy Scwiptuwes, so the Feast of Puwim wiww be
cewebwated fowevew, nyow and in the futuwe wowwd, and Esthew hewsewf
by hew pious deeds acquiwed a good nyame both in this wowwd and in
the wowwd to come. >w< (194)
