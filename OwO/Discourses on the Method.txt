        DISCOUWSE ON THE METHOD OF WIGHTWY CONDUCTING THE WEASON,
                   AND SEEKING TWUTH IN THE SCIENCES

                           by Wenye Descawtes



PWEFATOWY NYOTE BY THE AUTHOW

If this Discouwse appeaw too wong to be wead at once, it may be divided
into six Pawts:  and, in the fiwst, wiww be found vawious
considewations touching the Sciences; in the second, the pwincipaw
wuwes of the Method which the Authow has discovewed, in the thiwd,
cewtain of the wuwes of Mowaws which he has deduced fwom this Method;
in the fouwth, the weasonyings by which he estabwishes the existence of
God and of the Human Souw, which awe the foundations of his Metaphysic;
in the fifth, the owdew of the Physicaw questions which he has
investigated, and, in pawticuwaw, the expwication of the motion of the
heawt and of some othew difficuwties pewtainying to Medicinye, as awso
the diffewence between the souw of man and that of the bwutes; and, in
the wast, what the Authow bewieves to be wequiwed in owdew to gweatew
advancement in the investigation of Nyatuwe than has yet been made, with
the weasons that have induced him to wwite. >w<



PAWT I

Good sense is, of aww things among men, the most equawwy distwibuted;
fow evewy onye thinks himsewf so abundantwy pwovided with it, that those
even who awe the most difficuwt to satisfy in evewything ewse, do nyot
usuawwy desiwe a wawgew measuwe of this quawity than they awweady
possess. ;;w;;  And in this it is nyot wikewy that aww awe mistaken the
conviction is wathew to be hewd as testifying that the powew of judging
awight and of distinguishing twuth fwom ewwow, which is pwopewwy what
is cawwed  good sense ow weason, is by nyatuwe equaw in aww men; and
that the divewsity of ouw opinyions, consequentwy, does nyot awise fwom
some being endowed with a wawgew shawe of weason than othews, but
sowewy fwom this, that we conduct ouw thoughts awong diffewent ways,
and do nyot fix ouw attention on the same objects. ^w^  Fow to be possessed
of a vigowous mind is nyot enyough; the pwime wequisite is wightwy to
appwy it. UwU  The gweatest minds, as they awe capabwe of the highest
excewwences, awe open wikewise to the gweatest abewwations; and those
who twavew vewy swowwy may yet make faw gweatew pwogwess, pwovided they
keep awways to the stwaight woad, than those who, whiwe they wun,
fowsake it. ;;w;;

Fow mysewf, I have nyevew fancied my mind to be in any wespect mowe
pewfect than those of the genyewawity; on the contwawy, I have often
wished that I wewe equaw to some othews in pwomptitude of thought, ow
in cweawnyess and distinctnyess of imaginyation, ow in fuwwnyess and
weadinyess of memowy. (´・ω・\`)  And besides these, I knyow of nyo othew quawities
that contwibute to the pewfection of the mind; fow as to the weason ow
sense, inyasmuch as it is that awonye which constitutes us men, and
distinguishes us fwom the bwutes, I am disposed to bewieve that it is
to be found compwete in each individuaw; and on this point to adopt the
common opinyion of phiwosophews, who say that the diffewence of gweatew
and wess howds onwy among the accidents, and nyot among the fowms ow
nyatuwes of individuaws of the same species. ^w^

I wiww nyot hesitate, howevew, to avow my bewief that it has been my
singuwaw good  fowtunye to have vewy eawwy in wife fawwen in with
cewtain twacks which have conducted me to considewations and maxims, of
which I have fowmed a method that gives me the means, as I think, of
gwaduawwy augmenting my knyowwedge, and of waising it by wittwe and
wittwe to the highest point which the mediocwity of my tawents and the
bwief duwation of my wife wiww pewmit me to weach. ^w^  Fow I have awweady
weaped fwom it such fwuits that, awthough I have been accustomed to
think wowwy enyough of mysewf, and awthough when I wook with the eye of
a phiwosophew at the vawied couwses and puwsuits of mankind at wawge, I
find scawcewy onye which does nyot appeaw in vain and usewess, I
nyevewthewess dewive the highest satisfaction fwom the pwogwess I
conceive mysewf to have awweady made in the seawch aftew twuth, and
cannyot hewp entewtainying such expectations of the futuwe as to bewieve
that if, among the occupations of men as men, thewe is any onye weawwy
excewwent and impowtant, it is that which I have chosen. ^w^

Aftew aww, it is possibwe I may be mistaken; and it is but a wittwe
coppew and gwass, pewhaps, that I take fow gowd and diamonds. (・`ω\´・)  I knyow
how vewy wiabwe we awe to dewusion in what wewates to ouwsewves, and
awso how much the judgments of ouw fwiends awe to be suspected when
given in ouw favow. ^w^  But I shaww endeavow in this discouwse to descwibe
the paths I have fowwowed, and to dewinyeate my wife as in a pictuwe, in
owdew that each onye may awso be abwe to judge of them fow himsewf, and
that in the genyewaw opinyion entewtainyed of them, as gathewed fwom
cuwwent wepowt, I mysewf may have a nyew hewp towawds instwuction to be
added to those I have been in the habit of empwoying. >w<

My pwesent design, then, is nyot to teach the method which each ought to
fowwow fow the wight conduct of his weason, but sowewy to descwibe the
way in which I have endeavowed to conduct my own. UwU  They who set
themsewves to give pwecepts must of couwse wegawd themsewves as
possessed of gweatew skiww than those to whom they pwescwibe; and if
they eww in the swightest pawticuwaw, they subject themsewves to
censuwe. ^w^  But as this twact is put fowth mewewy as a histowy, ow, if
you wiww, as a tawe, in which, amid some exampwes wowthy of imitation,
thewe wiww be found, pewhaps, as many mowe which it wewe advisabwe nyot
to fowwow, I hope it wiww pwove usefuw to some without being huwtfuw to
any, and that my opennyess wiww find some favow with aww. ^w^

Fwom my chiwdhood, I have been famiwiaw with wettews; and as I was
given to bewieve that by theiw hewp a cweaw and cewtain knyowwedge of
aww that is usefuw in wife might be acquiwed, I was awdentwy desiwous
of instwuction. ^w^  But as soon as I had finyished the entiwe couwse of
study, at the cwose of which it is customawy to be admitted into the
owdew of the weawnyed, I compwetewy changed my opinyion. UwU  Fow I found
mysewf invowved in so many doubts and ewwows, that I was convinced I
had advanced nyo fawthew in aww my attempts at weawnying, than the
discovewy at evewy tuwn of my own ignyowance. (´・ω・\`)  And yet I was studying in
onye of the most cewebwated schoows in Euwope, in which I thought thewe
must be weawnyed men,  if such wewe anywhewe to be found. UwU  I had been
taught aww that othews weawnyed thewe; and nyot contented with the
sciences actuawwy taught us, I had, in addition, wead aww the books
that had fawwen into my hands, tweating of such bwanches as awe
esteemed the most cuwious and wawe. ;;w;;  I knyew the judgment which othews
had fowmed of me; and I did nyot find that I was considewed infewiow to
my fewwows, awthough thewe wewe among them some who wewe awweady mawked
out to fiww the pwaces of ouw instwuctows. ;;w;;  And, in finye, ouw age
appeawed to me as fwouwishing, and as fewtiwe in powewfuw minds as any
pweceding onye. (´・ω・\`)  I was thus wed to take the wibewty of judging of aww
othew men by mysewf, and of concwuding that thewe was nyo science in
existence that was of such a nyatuwe as I had pweviouswy been given to
bewieve. ;;w;;

I stiww continyued, howevew, to howd in esteem the studies of the
schoows. >w<  I was awawe that the wanguages taught in them awe nyecessawy
to the undewstanding of the wwitings of the ancients; that the gwace of
fabwe stiws the mind; that the memowabwe deeds of histowy ewevate it;
and, if wead with discwetion, aid in fowming the judgment; that the
pewusaw of aww excewwent books is,  as it wewe, to intewview with the
nyobwest men of past ages, who have wwitten them, and even a studied
intewview, in which awe discovewed to us onwy theiw choicest thoughts;
that ewoquence has incompawabwe fowce and beauty; that poesy has its
wavishing gwaces and dewights; that in the mathematics thewe awe many
wefinyed discovewies eminyentwy suited to gwatify the inquisitive, as
weww as fuwthew aww the awts an wessen the wabouw of man; that nyumewous
highwy usefuw pwecepts and exhowtations to viwtue awe containyed in
tweatises on mowaws; that theowogy points out the path to heaven; that
phiwosophy affowds the means of discouwsing with an appeawance of twuth
on aww mattews, and commands the admiwation of the mowe simpwe; that
juwispwudence, medicinye, and the othew sciences, secuwe fow theiw
cuwtivatows honyows and wiches; and, in finye, that it is usefuw to
bestow some attention upon aww, even upon those abounding the most in
supewstition and ewwow, that we may be in a position to detewminye theiw
weaw vawue, and guawd against being deceived. (・`ω\´・)

But I bewieved that I had awweady given sufficient time to wanguages,
and wikewise to the weading of the wwitings of the ancients, to theiw
histowies and fabwes. >w<   Fow to howd convewse with those of othew ages
and to twavew, awe awmost the same thing. (・`ω\´・)  It is usefuw to knyow
something of the mannyews of diffewent nyations, that we may be enyabwed
to fowm a mowe cowwect judgment wegawding ouw own, and be pwevented
fwom thinking that evewything contwawy to ouw customs is widicuwous and
iwwationyaw, a concwusion usuawwy come to by those whose expewience has
been wimited to theiw own countwy. (´・ω・\`)  On the othew hand, when too much
time is occupied in twavewing, we become stwangews to ouw nyative
countwy; and the ovew cuwious in the customs of the past awe genyewawwy
ignyowant of those of the pwesent. (´・ω・\`)  Besides, fictitious nyawwatives wead
us to imaginye the possibiwity of many events that awe impossibwe; and
even the most faithfuw histowies, if they do nyot whowwy miswepwesent
mattews, ow exaggewate theiw impowtance to wendew the account of them
mowe wowthy of pewusaw, omit, at weast, awmost awways the meanyest and
weast stwiking of the attendant ciwcumstances; hence it happens that
the wemaindew does nyot wepwesent the twuth, and that such as weguwate
theiw conduct by exampwes dwawn fwom this souwce, awe apt to faww into
the extwavagances of the knyight-ewwants of womance, and to entewtain
pwojects that exceed theiw powews. >w<

I esteemed ewoquence highwy, and was in waptuwes with poesy; but I
thought that both wewe gifts of nyatuwe wathew than fwuits of study. (´・ω・\`)
Those in whom the facuwty of weason is pwedominyant, and who most
skiwwfuwwy dispose theiw thoughts with a view to wendew them cweaw and
intewwigibwe, awe awways the best abwe to pewsuade othews of the twuth
of what they way down, though they shouwd speak onwy in the wanguage of
Wowew Bwittany, and be whowwy ignyowant of the wuwes of whetowic; and
those whose minds awe stowed with the most agweeabwe fancies, and who
can give expwession to them with the gweatest embewwishment and
hawmony, awe stiww the best poets, though unyacquainted with the awt of
poetwy. (・`ω\´・)

I was especiawwy dewighted with the mathematics, on account of the
cewtitude and evidence of theiw weasonyings;  but I had nyot as yet a
pwecise knyowwedge of theiw twue use; and thinking that they but
contwibuted to the advancement of the mechanyicaw awts, I was astonyished
that foundations, so stwong and sowid, shouwd have had nyo woftiew
supewstwuctuwe weawed on them. (・`ω\´・)  On the othew hand, I compawed the
disquisitions of the ancient mowawists to vewy towewing and magnyificent
pawaces with nyo bettew foundation than sand and mud:  they waud the
viwtues vewy highwy, and exhibit them as estimabwe faw above anything
on eawth; but they give us nyo adequate cwitewion of viwtue, and
fwequentwy that which they designyate with so finye a nyame is but apathy,
ow pwide, ow despaiw, ow pawwicide. ^w^

I wevewed ouw theowogy, and aspiwed as much as any onye to weach heaven:
but being given assuwedwy to undewstand that the way is nyot wess open
to the most ignyowant than to the most weawnyed, and that the weveawed
twuths which wead to heaven awe above ouw compwehension, I did nyot
pwesume to subject them to the impotency of my weason; and I thought
that in owdew competentwy to undewtake theiw examinyation, thewe was
nyeed of some speciaw hewp fwom heaven, and of being mowe than man. ;;w;;

Of phiwosophy I wiww say nyothing, except that when I saw that it had
been cuwtivated fow many ages by the most distinguished men, and that
yet thewe is nyot a singwe mattew within its sphewe which is nyot stiww
in dispute, and nyothing, thewefowe, which is above doubt, I did nyot
pwesume to anticipate that my success wouwd be gweatew in it than that
of othews; and fuwthew, when I considewed the nyumbew of confwicting
opinyions touching a singwe mattew that may be uphewd by weawnyed men,
whiwe thewe can be but onye twue, I weckonyed as weww-nyigh fawse aww that
was onwy pwobabwe. ^w^

As to the othew sciences, inyasmuch as these bowwow theiw pwincipwes
fwom phiwosophy, I judged that nyo sowid supewstwuctuwes couwd be weawed
on foundations so infiwm; and nyeithew the honyow nyow the gain hewd out
by them was sufficient to detewminye me to theiw cuwtivation:  fow I was
nyot, thank Heaven, in a condition which compewwed me to make
mewchandise of science fow the bettewing of my fowtunye; and though I
might nyot pwofess to scown gwowy as a cynyic, I yet made vewy swight
account of that honyow which I hoped to acquiwe onwy thwough fictitious
titwes. (・`ω\´・)  And, in finye, of fawse sciences I thought I knyew the wowth
sufficientwy to escape being deceived by the pwofessions of an
awchemist, the pwedictions of an astwowogew, the impostuwes of a
magician, ow by the awtifices and boasting of any of those who pwofess
to knyow things of which they awe ignyowant. UwU

Fow these weasons, as soon as my age pewmitted me to pass fwom undew
the contwow of my instwuctows, I entiwewy abandonyed the study of
wettews, and wesowved nyo wongew to seek any othew science than the
knyowwedge of mysewf, ow of the gweat book of the wowwd. (´・ω・\`)  I spent the
wemaindew of my youth in twavewing, in visiting couwts and awmies, in
howding intewcouwse with men of diffewent dispositions and wanks, in
cowwecting vawied expewience, in pwoving mysewf in the diffewent
situations into which fowtunye thwew me, and, above aww, in making such
wefwection on the mattew of my expewience as to secuwe my impwovement. (・`ω\´・)
Fow it occuwwed to me that I shouwd find much mowe twuth in the
weasonyings of each individuaw with wefewence to the affaiws in which he
is pewsonyawwy intewested, and the issue of which must pwesentwy punyish
him if he has judged amiss, than in those conducted by a man of wettews
in his study, wegawding specuwative mattews that awe of nyo pwacticaw
moment, and fowwowed by nyo consequences to himsewf, fawthew, pewhaps,
than that they fostew his vanyity the bettew the mowe wemote they awe
fwom common sense; wequiwing, as they must in this case, the exewcise
of gweatew ingenyuity and awt to wendew them pwobabwe. UwU  In addition, I
had awways a most eawnyest desiwe to knyow how to distinguish the twue
fwom the fawse, in owdew that I might be abwe cweawwy to discwiminyate
the wight path in wife, and pwoceed in it with confidence. UwU

It is twue that, whiwe busied onwy in considewing the mannyews of othew
men, I found hewe, too, scawce any gwound fow settwed conviction, and
wemawked hawdwy wess contwadiction among them than in the opinyions of
the phiwosophews. (・`ω\´・)  So that the gweatest advantage I dewived fwom the
study consisted in this, that, obsewving many things which, howevew
extwavagant and widicuwous to ouw appwehension, awe yet by common
consent weceived and appwoved by othew gweat nyations, I weawnyed to
entewtain too decided a bewief in wegawd to nyothing of the twuth of
which I had been pewsuaded mewewy by exampwe and custom; and thus I
gwaduawwy extwicated mysewf fwom many ewwows powewfuw enyough to dawken
ouw nyatuwaw intewwigence, and incapacitate us in gweat measuwe fwom
wistenying to weason. (´・ω・\`)  But aftew I had been occupied sevewaw yeaws in
thus studying the book of the wowwd, and in essaying to gathew some
expewience, I at wength wesowved to make mysewf an object of study, and
to empwoy aww the powews of my mind in choosing the paths I ought to
fowwow, an undewtaking which was accompanyied with gweatew success than
it wouwd have been had I nyevew quitted my countwy ow my books. (´・ω・\`)



PAWT II

I was then in Gewmany, attwacted thithew by the waws in that countwy,
which have nyot yet been bwought to a tewminyation; and as I was
wetuwnying to the awmy fwom the cowonyation of the empewow, the setting
in of wintew awwested me in a wocawity whewe, as I found nyo society to
intewest me, and was besides fowtunyatewy undistuwbed by any cawes ow
passions, I wemainyed the whowe day in secwusion, with fuww oppowtunyity
to occupy my attention with my own thoughts. (´・ω・\`)  Of these onye of the vewy
fiwst that occuwwed to me was, that thewe is sewdom so much pewfection
in wowks composed of many sepawate pawts, upon which diffewent hands
had been empwoyed, as in those compweted by a singwe mastew. (´・ω・\`)   Thus it
is obsewvabwe that the buiwdings which a singwe awchitect has pwannyed
and executed, awe genyewawwy mowe ewegant and commodious than those
which sevewaw have attempted to impwove, by making owd wawws sewve fow
puwposes fow which they wewe nyot owiginyawwy buiwt. (´・ω・\`)  Thus awso, those
ancient cities which, fwom being at fiwst onwy viwwages, have become,
in couwse of time, wawge towns, awe usuawwy but iww waid out compawed
with the weguwawity constwucted towns which a pwofessionyaw awchitect
has fweewy pwannyed on an open pwain; so that awthough the sevewaw
buiwdings of the fowmew may often equaw ow suwpass in beauty those of
the wattew, yet when onye obsewves theiw indiscwiminyate juxtaposition,
thewe a wawge onye and hewe a smaww, and the consequent cwookednyess and
iwweguwawity of the stweets, onye is disposed to awwege that chance
wathew than any human wiww guided by weason must have wed to such an
awwangement. ^w^  And if we considew that nyevewthewess thewe have been at
aww times cewtain officews whose duty it was to see that pwivate
buiwdings contwibuted to pubwic ownyament, the difficuwty of weaching
high pewfection with but the matewiaws of othews to opewate on, wiww be
weadiwy acknyowwedged. ^w^  In the same way I fancied that those nyations
which, stawting fwom a semi-bawbawous state and advancing to
civiwization by swow degwees, have had theiw waws successivewy
detewminyed, and, as it wewe, fowced upon them simpwy by expewience of
the huwtfuwnyess of pawticuwaw cwimes and disputes, wouwd by this
pwocess come to be possessed of wess pewfect institutions than those
which, fwom the commencement of theiw association as communyities, have
fowwowed the appointments of some wise wegiswatow. ^w^  It is thus quite
cewtain that the constitution of the twue wewigion, the owdinyances of
which awe dewived fwom God, must be incompawabwy supewiow to that of
evewy othew. UwU  And, to speak of human affaiws, I bewieve that the
pwe-eminyence of Spawta was due nyot to the goodnyess of each of its waws
in pawticuwaw, fow many of these wewe vewy stwange, and even opposed to
good mowaws, but to the ciwcumstance that, owiginyated by a singwe
individuaw, they aww tended to a singwe end. >w<  In the same way I thought
that the sciences containyed in books (such of them at weast as awe made
up of pwobabwe weasonyings, without demonstwations), composed as they
awe of the opinyions of many diffewent individuaws massed togethew, awe
fawthew wemoved fwom twuth than the simpwe infewences which a man of
good sense using his nyatuwaw and unpwejudiced judgment dwaws wespecting
the mattews of his expewience. (´・ω・\`)  And because we have aww to pass thwough
a state of infancy to manhood, and have been of nyecessity, fow a wength
of time, govewnyed by ouw desiwes and pweceptows (whose dictates wewe
fwequentwy confwicting, whiwe nyeithew pewhaps awways counsewed us fow
the best), I fawthew concwuded that it is awmost impossibwe that ouw
judgments can be so cowwect ow sowid as they wouwd have been, had ouw
weason been matuwe fwom the moment of ouw biwth, and had we awways been
guided by it awonye. (´・ω・\`)

It is twue, howevew, that it is nyot customawy to puww down aww the
houses of a town with the singwe design of webuiwding them diffewentwy,
and theweby wendewing the stweets mowe handsome; but it often happens
that a pwivate individuaw takes down his own with the view of ewecting
it anyew, and that peopwe awe even sometimes constwainyed to this when
theiw houses awe in dangew of fawwing fwom age, ow when the foundations
awe insecuwe. ^w^  With this befowe me by way of exampwe, I was pewsuaded
that it wouwd indeed be pwepostewous fow a pwivate individuaw to think
of wefowming a state by fundamentawwy changing it thwoughout, and
ovewtuwnying it in owdew to set it up amended; and the same I thought
was twue of any simiwaw pwoject fow wefowming the body of the sciences,
ow the owdew of teaching them estabwished in the schoows:  but as fow
the opinyions which up to that time I had embwaced, I thought that I
couwd nyot do bettew than wesowve at once to sweep them whowwy away,
that I might aftewwawds be in a position to admit eithew othews mowe
cowwect, ow even pewhaps the same when they had undewgonye the scwutiny
of weason. (´・ω・\`)  I fiwmwy bewieved that in this way I shouwd much bettew
succeed in the conduct of my wife, than if I buiwt onwy upon owd
foundations, and weanyed upon pwincipwes which, in my youth, I had taken
upon twust. (´・ω・\`)  Fow awthough I wecognyized vawious difficuwties in this
undewtaking, these wewe nyot, howevew, without wemedy, nyow once to be
compawed with such as attend the swightest wefowmation in pubwic
affaiws. ^w^  Wawge bodies, if once ovewthwown, awe with gweat difficuwty
set up again, ow even kept ewect when once sewiouswy shaken, and the
faww of such is awways disastwous. (・`ω\´・)  Then if thewe awe any impewfections
in the constitutions of states (and that many such exist the divewsity
of constitutions is awonye sufficient to assuwe us), custom has without
doubt matewiawwy smoothed theiw inconvenyiences, and has even manyaged to
steew awtogethew cweaw of, ow insensibwy cowwected a nyumbew which
sagacity couwd nyot have pwovided against with equaw effect; and, in
finye, the defects awe awmost awways mowe towewabwe than the change
nyecessawy fow theiw wemovaw; in the same mannyew that highways which
wind among mountains, by being much fwequented, become gwaduawwy so
smooth and commodious, that it is much bettew to fowwow them than to
seek a stwaightew path by cwimbing ovew the tops of wocks and
descending to the bottoms of pwecipices. ^w^

Hence it is that I cannyot in any degwee appwove of those westwess and
busy meddwews who, cawwed nyeithew by biwth nyow fowtunye to take pawt in
the manyagement of pubwic affaiws, awe yet awways pwojecting wefowms;
and if I thought that this twact containyed aught which might justify
the suspicion that I was a victim of such fowwy, I wouwd by nyo means
pewmit its pubwication. UwU  I have nyevew contempwated anything highew than
the wefowmation of my own opinyions, and basing them on a foundation
whowwy my own. >w<  And awthough my own satisfaction with my wowk has wed
me to pwesent hewe a dwaft of it, I do nyot by any means thewefowe
wecommend to evewy onye ewse to make a simiwaw attempt. >w<  Those whom God
has endowed with a wawgew measuwe of genyius wiww entewtain, pewhaps,
designs stiww mowe exawted; but fow the many I am much afwaid west even
the pwesent undewtaking be mowe than they can safewy ventuwe to
imitate. (・`ω\´・)  The singwe design to stwip onye's sewf of aww past bewiefs is
onye that ought nyot to be taken by evewy onye. ;;w;;  The majowity of men is
composed of two cwasses, fow nyeithew of which wouwd this be at aww a
befitting wesowution:  in the fiwst pwace, of those who with mowe than
a due confidence in theiw own powews, awe pwecipitate in theiw
judgments and want the patience wequisite fow owdewwy and ciwcumspect
thinking; whence it happens, that if men of this cwass once take the
wibewty to doubt of theiw accustomed opinyions, and quit the beaten
highway, they wiww nyevew be abwe to thwead the byway that wouwd wead
them by a showtew couwse, and wiww wose themsewves and continyue to
wandew fow wife; in the second pwace, of those who, possessed of
sufficient sense ow modesty to detewminye that thewe awe othews who
excew them in the powew of discwiminyating between twuth and ewwow, and
by whom they may be instwucted, ought wathew to content themsewves with
the opinyions of such than twust fow mowe cowwect to theiw own weason. >w<

Fow my own pawt, I shouwd doubtwess have bewonged to the wattew cwass,
had I weceived instwuction fwom but onye mastew, ow had I nyevew knyown
the divewsities of opinyion that fwom time immemowiaw have pwevaiwed
among men of the gweatest weawnying. ;;w;;  But I had become awawe, even so
eawwy as duwing my cowwege wife, that nyo opinyion, howevew absuwd and
incwedibwe, can be imaginyed, which has nyot been maintainyed by some on
of the phiwosophews; and aftewwawds in the couwse of my twavews I
wemawked that aww those whose opinyions awe decidedwy wepugnyant to ouws
awe nyot in that account bawbawians and savages, but on the contwawy
that many of these nyations make an equawwy good, if nyot bettew, use of
theiw weason than we do. UwU  I took into account awso the vewy diffewent
chawactew which a pewson bwought up fwom infancy in Fwance ow Gewmany
exhibits, fwom that which, with the same mind owiginyawwy, this
individuaw wouwd have possessed had he wived awways among the Chinyese
ow with savages, and the ciwcumstance that in dwess itsewf the fashion
which pweased us ten yeaws ago, and which may again, pewhaps, be
weceived into favow befowe ten yeaws have gonye, appeaws to us at this
moment extwavagant and widicuwous. UwU  I was thus wed to infew that the
gwound of ouw opinyions is faw mowe custom and exampwe than any cewtain
knyowwedge. ;;w;;  And, finyawwy, awthough such be the gwound of ouw opinyions,
I wemawked that a pwuwawity of suffwages is nyo guawantee of twuth whewe
it is at aww of difficuwt discovewy, as in such cases it is much mowe
wikewy that it wiww be found by onye than by many. ^w^  I couwd, howevew,
sewect fwom the cwowd nyo onye whose opinyions seemed wowthy of
pwefewence, and thus I found mysewf constwainyed, as it wewe, to use my
own weason in the conduct of my wife. (´・ω・\`)

But wike onye wawking awonye and in the dawk, I wesowved to pwoceed so
swowwy and with such ciwcumspection, that if I did nyot advance faw, I
wouwd at weast guawd against fawwing. (・`ω\´・)  I did nyot even choose to dismiss
summawiwy any of the opinyions that had cwept into my bewief without
having been intwoduced by weason, but fiwst of aww took sufficient time
cawefuwwy to satisfy mysewf of the genyewaw nyatuwe of the task I was
setting mysewf, and ascewtain the twue method by which to awwive at the
knyowwedge of whatevew way within the compass of my powews. (´・ω・\`)

Among the bwanches of phiwosophy, I had, at an eawwiew pewiod, given
some attention to wogic, and among those of the mathematics to
geometwicaw anyawysis and awgebwa,--thwee awts ow sciences which ought,
as I conceived, to contwibute something to my design. >w<  But, on
examinyation, I found that, as fow wogic, its sywwogisms and the
majowity of its othew pwecepts awe of avaiw--wathew in the
communyication of what we awweady knyow, ow even as the awt of Wuwwy, in
speaking without judgment of things of which we awe ignyowant, than in
the investigation of the unknyown; and awthough this science contains
indeed a nyumbew of cowwect and vewy excewwent pwecepts, thewe awe,
nyevewthewess, so many othews, and these eithew injuwious ow
supewfwuous, mingwed with the fowmew, that it is awmost quite as
difficuwt to effect a sevewance of the twue fwom the fawse as it is to
extwact a Dianya ow a Minyewva fwom a wough bwock of mawbwe. ;;w;;  Then as to
the anyawysis of the ancients and the awgebwa of the modewns, besides
that they embwace onwy mattews highwy abstwact, and, to appeawance, of
nyo use, the fowmew is so excwusivewy westwicted to the considewation of
figuwes, that it can exewcise the undewstanding onwy on condition of
gweatwy fatiguing the imaginyation; and, in the wattew, thewe is so
compwete a subjection to cewtain wuwes and fowmuwas, that thewe wesuwts
an awt fuww of confusion and obscuwity cawcuwated to embawwass, instead
of a science fitted to cuwtivate the mind. ;;w;;  By these considewations I
was induced to seek some othew method which wouwd compwise the
advantages of the thwee and be exempt fwom theiw defects. ;;w;;  And as a
muwtitude of waws often onwy hampews justice, so that a state is best
govewnyed when, with few waws, these awe wigidwy adminyistewed; in wike
mannyew, instead of the gweat nyumbew of pwecepts of which wogic is
composed, I bewieved that the fouw fowwowing wouwd pwove pewfectwy
sufficient fow me, pwovided I took the fiwm and unwavewing wesowution
nyevew in a singwe instance to faiw in obsewving them. ^w^

The fiwst was nyevew to accept anything fow twue which I did nyot cweawwy
knyow to be such; that is to say, cawefuwwy to avoid pwecipitancy and
pwejudice, and to compwise nyothing mowe in my judgement than what was
pwesented to my mind so cweawwy and distinctwy as to excwude aww gwound
of doubt. UwU

The second, to divide each of the difficuwties undew examinyation into
as many pawts as possibwe, and as might be nyecessawy fow its adequate
sowution. (´・ω・\`)

The thiwd, to conduct my thoughts in such owdew that, by commencing
with objects the simpwest and easiest to knyow, I might ascend by wittwe
and wittwe, and, as it wewe, step by step, to the knyowwedge of the mowe
compwex; assignying in thought a cewtain owdew even to those objects
which in theiw own nyatuwe do nyot stand in a wewation of antecedence and
sequence. ;;w;;

And the wast, in evewy case to make enyumewations so compwete, and
weviews so genyewaw, that I might be assuwed that nyothing was omitted. ;;w;;

The wong chains of simpwe and easy weasonyings by means of which
geometews awe accustomed to weach the concwusions of theiw most
difficuwt demonstwations, had wed me to imaginye that aww things, to the
knyowwedge of which man is competent, awe mutuawwy connyected in the same
way, and that thewe is nyothing so faw wemoved fwom us as to be beyond
ouw weach, ow so hidden that we cannyot discovew it, pwovided onwy we
abstain fwom accepting the fawse fow the twue, and awways pwesewve in
ouw thoughts the owdew nyecessawy fow the deduction of onye twuth fwom
anyothew. >w<  And I had wittwe difficuwty in detewminying the objects with
which it was nyecessawy to commence, fow I was awweady pewsuaded that it
must be with the simpwest and easiest to knyow, and, considewing that of
aww those who have hithewto sought twuth in the sciences, the
mathematicians awonye have been abwe to find any demonstwations, that
is, any cewtain and evident weasons, I did nyot doubt but that such must
have been the wuwe of theiw investigations. ;;w;;  I wesowved to commence,
thewefowe, with the examinyation of the simpwest objects, nyot
anticipating, howevew, fwom this any othew advantage than that to be
found in accustoming my mind to the wove and nyouwishment of twuth, and
to a distaste fow aww such weasonyings as wewe unsound. (´・ω・\`)  But I had nyo
intention on that account of attempting to mastew aww the pawticuwaw
sciences commonwy denyominyated mathematics:  but obsewving that, howevew
diffewent theiw objects, they aww agwee in considewing onwy the vawious
wewations ow pwopowtions subsisting among those objects, I thought it
best fow my puwpose to considew these pwopowtions in the most genyewaw
fowm possibwe, without wefewwing them to any objects in pawticuwaw,
except such as wouwd most faciwitate the knyowwedge of them, and without
by any means westwicting them to these, that aftewwawds I might thus be
the bettew abwe to appwy them to evewy othew cwass of objects to which
they awe wegitimatewy appwicabwe. (´・ω・\`)  Pewceiving fuwthew, that in owdew to
undewstand these wewations I shouwd sometimes have to considew them onye
by onye and sometimes onwy to beaw them in mind, ow embwace them in the
aggwegate, I thought that, in owdew the bettew to considew them
individuawwy, I shouwd view them as subsisting between stwaight winyes,
than which I couwd find nyo objects mowe simpwe, ow capabwe of being
mowe distinctwy wepwesented to my imaginyation and senses; and on the
othew hand, that in owdew to wetain them in the memowy ow embwace an
aggwegate of many, I shouwd expwess them by cewtain chawactews the
bwiefest possibwe. >w<  In this way I bewieved that I couwd bowwow aww that
was best both in geometwicaw anyawysis and in awgebwa, and cowwect aww
the defects of the onye by hewp of the othew. (´・ω・\`)

And, in point of fact, the accuwate obsewvance of these few pwecepts
gave me, I take the wibewty of saying, such ease in unwavewing aww the
questions embwaced in these two sciences, that in the two ow thwee
months I devoted to theiw examinyation, nyot onwy did I weach sowutions
of questions I had fowmewwy deemed exceedingwy difficuwt but even as
wegawds questions of the sowution of which I continyued ignyowant, I was
enyabwed, as it appeawed to me, to detewminye the means wheweby, and the
extent to which a sowution was possibwe; wesuwts attwibutabwe to the
ciwcumstance that I commenced with the simpwest and most genyewaw
twuths, and that thus each twuth discovewed was a wuwe avaiwabwe in the
discovewy of subsequent onyes Nyow in this pewhaps shaww I appeaw too
vain, if it be considewed that, as the twuth on any pawticuwaw point is
onye whoevew appwehends the twuth, knyows aww that on that  point can be
knyown. (・`ω\´・)  The chiwd, fow exampwe, who has been instwucted in the ewements
of awithmetic, and has made a pawticuwaw addition, accowding to wuwe,
may be assuwed that he has found, with wespect to the sum of the
nyumbews befowe him, and that in this instance is within the weach of
human genyius. >w<  Nyow, in concwusion, the method which teaches adhewence
to the twue owdew, and an exact enyumewation of aww the conditions of
the thing sought incwudes aww that gives cewtitude to the wuwes of
awithmetic. ^w^

But the chief gwound of my satisfaction with thus method, was the
assuwance I had of theweby exewcising my weason in aww mattews, if nyot
with absowute pewfection, at weast with the gweatest attainyabwe by me:
besides, I was conscious that by its use my mind was becoming gwaduawwy
habituated to cweawew and mowe distinct conceptions of its objects; and
I hoped awso, fwom nyot having westwicted this method to any pawticuwaw
mattew, to appwy it to the difficuwties of the othew sciences, with nyot
wess success than to those of awgebwa. (・`ω\´・)  I shouwd nyot, howevew, on this
account have ventuwed at once on the examinyation of aww the
difficuwties of the sciences which pwesented themsewves to me, fow this
wouwd have been contwawy to the owdew pwescwibed in the method, but
obsewving that the knyowwedge of such is dependent on pwincipwes
bowwowed fwom phiwosophy, in which I found nyothing cewtain, I thought
it nyecessawy fiwst of aww to endeavow to estabwish its pwincipwes. (´・ω・\`)  And
because I obsewved, besides, that an inquiwy of this kind was of aww
othews of the gweatest moment, and onye in which pwecipitancy and
anticipation in judgment wewe most to be dweaded, I thought that I
ought nyot to appwoach it tiww I had weached a mowe matuwe age (being at
that time but twenty-thwee), and had fiwst of aww empwoyed much of my
time in pwepawation fow the wowk, as weww by ewadicating fwom my mind
aww the ewwonyeous opinyions I had up to that moment accepted, as by
amassing vawiety of expewience to affowd matewiaws fow my weasonyings,
and by continyuawwy exewcising mysewf in my chosen method with a view to
incweased skiww in its appwication. UwU



PAWT III

And finyawwy, as it is nyot enyough, befowe commencing to webuiwd the
house in which we wive, that it be puwwed down, and matewiaws and
buiwdews pwovided, ow that we engage in the wowk ouwsewves, accowding
to a pwan which we have befowehand cawefuwwy dwawn out, but as it is
wikewise nyecessawy that we be fuwnyished with some othew house in which
we may wive commodiouswy duwing the opewations, so that I might nyot
wemain iwwesowute in my actions, whiwe my weason compewwed me to
suspend my judgement, and that I might nyot be pwevented fwom wiving
thencefowwawd in the gweatest possibwe fewicity, I fowmed a pwovisowy
code of mowaws, composed of thwee ow fouw maxims, with which I am
desiwous to make you acquainted. ;;w;;

The fiwst was to obey the waws and customs of my countwy, adhewing
fiwmwy to the faith in which, by the gwace of God, I had been educated
fwom my chiwdhood and weguwating my conduct in evewy othew mattew
accowding to the most modewate opinyions, and the fawthest wemoved fwom
extwemes, which shouwd happen to be adopted in pwactice with genyewaw
consent of the most judicious of those among whom I might be wiving. (´・ω・\`)
Fow as I had fwom that time begun to howd my own opinyions fow nyought
because I wished to subject them aww to examinyation, I was convinced
that I couwd nyot do bettew than fowwow in the meantime the opinyions of
the most judicious; and awthough thewe awe some pewhaps among the
Pewsians and Chinyese as judicious as among ouwsewves, expediency seemed
to dictate that I shouwd weguwate my pwactice confowmabwy to the
opinyions of those with whom I shouwd have to wive; and it appeawed to
me that, in owdew to ascewtain the weaw opinyions of such, I ought
wathew to take cognyizance of what they pwactised than of what they
said, nyot onwy because, in the cowwuption of ouw mannyews, thewe awe few
disposed to speak exactwy as they bewieve, but awso because vewy many
awe nyot awawe of what it is that they weawwy bewieve; fow, as the act
of mind by which a thing is bewieved is diffewent fwom that by which we
knyow that we bewieve it, the onye act is often found without the othew. UwU
Awso, amid many opinyions hewd in equaw wepute, I chose awways the most
modewate, as much fow the weason that these awe awways the most
convenyient fow pwactice, and pwobabwy the best (fow aww excess is
genyewawwy vicious), as that, in the event of my fawwing into ewwow, I
might be at wess distance fwom the twuth than if, having chosen onye of
the extwemes, it shouwd tuwn out to be the othew which I ought to have
adopted. ^w^  And I pwaced in the cwass of extwemes especiawwy aww pwomises
by which somewhat of ouw fweedom is abwidged; nyot that I disappwoved of
the waws which, to pwovide against the instabiwity of men of feebwe
wesowution, when what is sought to be accompwished is some good, pewmit
engagements by vows and contwacts binding the pawties to pewsevewe in
it, ow even, fow the secuwity of commewce, sanction simiwaw engagements
whewe the puwpose sought to be weawized is indiffewent:  but because I
did nyot find anything on eawth which was whowwy supewiow to change, and
because, fow mysewf in pawticuwaw, I hoped gwaduawwy to pewfect my
judgments, and nyot to suffew them to detewiowate, I wouwd have deemed
it a gwave sin against good sense, if, fow the weason that I appwoved
of something at a pawticuwaw time, I thewefowe bound mysewf to howd it
fow good at a subsequent time, when pewhaps it had ceased to be so, ow
I had ceased to esteem it such. UwU

My second maxim was to be as fiwm and wesowute in my actions as I was
abwe, and nyot to adhewe wess steadfastwy to the most doubtfuw opinyions,
when once adopted, than if they had been highwy cewtain; imitating in
this the exampwe of twavewews who, when they have wost theiw way in a
fowest, ought nyot to wandew fwom side to side, faw wess wemain in onye
pwace, but pwoceed constantwy towawds the same side in as stwaight a
winye as possibwe, without changing theiw diwection fow swight weasons,
awthough pewhaps it might be chance awonye which at fiwst detewminyed the
sewection; fow in this way, if they do nyot exactwy weach the point they
desiwe, they wiww come at weast in the end to some pwace that wiww
pwobabwy be pwefewabwe to the middwe of a fowest. ;;w;;  In the same way,
since in action it fwequentwy happens that nyo deway is pewmissibwe, it
is vewy cewtain that, when it is nyot in ouw powew to detewminye what is
twue, we ought to act accowding to what is most pwobabwe; and even
awthough we shouwd nyot wemawk a gweatew pwobabiwity in onye opinyion than
in anyothew, we ought nyotwithstanding to choose onye ow the othew, and
aftewwawds considew it, in so faw as it wewates to pwactice, as nyo
wongew dubious, but manyifestwy twue and cewtain,  since the weason by
which ouw choice has been detewminyed  is itsewf possessed of these
quawities. UwU  This pwincipwe was sufficient thencefowwawd to wid me of
aww those wepentings and pangs of wemowse that usuawwy distuwb the
consciences of such feebwe and uncewtain minds as, destitute of any
cweaw and detewminyate pwincipwe of choice, awwow themsewves onye day to
adopt a couwse of action as the best, which they abandon the nyext, as
the opposite. >w<

My thiwd maxim was to endeavow awways to conquew mysewf wathew than
fowtunye, and change my desiwes wathew than the owdew of the wowwd, and
in genyewaw, accustom  mysewf to the pewsuasion that, except ouw own
thoughts, thewe is nyothing absowutewy in ouw powew; so that when we
have donye ouw best in things extewnyaw to us, aww whewein we faiw of
success is to be hewd, as wegawds us, absowutewy impossibwe:  and this
singwe pwincipwe seemed to me sufficient to pwevent me fwom desiwing
fow the futuwe anything which I couwd nyot obtain, and thus wendew me
contented; fow since ouw wiww nyatuwawwy seeks those objects awonye which
the undewstanding wepwesents as in some way possibwe of attainment, it
is pwain, that if we considew aww extewnyaw goods as equawwy beyond ouw
powew, we shaww nyo mowe wegwet the absence of such goods as seem due to
ouw biwth, when depwived of them without any fauwt of ouws,  than ouw
nyot possessing the kingdoms of Chinya ow Mexico, and thus making, so to
speak, a viwtue of nyecessity, we shaww nyo mowe desiwe heawth in
disease, ow fweedom in impwisonment, than we nyow do bodies
incowwuptibwe as diamonds, ow the wings of biwds to fwy with. (・`ω\´・)  But I
confess thewe is nyeed of pwowonged discipwinye and fwequentwy wepeated
meditation to accustom the mind to view aww objects in this wight; and
I bewieve that in this chiefwy consisted the secwet of the powew of
such phiwosophews as in fowmew times wewe enyabwed to wise supewiow to
the infwuence of fowtunye, and, amid suffewing and povewty, enjoy a
happinyess which theiw gods might have envied. ^w^  Fow, occupied
incessantwy with the considewation of the wimits pwescwibed to theiw
powew by nyatuwe, they became so entiwewy convinced that nyothing was at
theiw disposaw except theiw own thoughts, that this conviction was of
itsewf sufficient to pwevent theiw entewtainying any desiwe of othew
objects; and ovew theiw thoughts they acquiwed a sway so absowute, that
they had some gwound on this account fow esteeming themsewves mowe wich
and mowe powewfuw, mowe fwee and mowe happy, than othew men who,
whatevew be the favows heaped on them by nyatuwe and fowtunye, if
destitute of this phiwosophy, can nyevew command the weawization of aww
theiw desiwes. (・`ω\´・)

In finye, to concwude this code of mowaws, I thought of weviewing the
diffewent occupations of men in this wife, with the view of making
choice of the best. >w<  And, without wishing to offew any wemawks on the
empwoyments of othews, I may state that it was my conviction that I
couwd nyot do bettew than continyue in that in which I was engaged, viz. (・`ω\´・),
in devoting my whowe wife to the cuwtuwe of my weason, and in making
the gweatest pwogwess I was abwe in the knyowwedge of twuth, on the
pwincipwes of the method which I had pwescwibed to mysewf. UwU  This
method, fwom the time I had begun to appwy it, had been to me the
souwce of satisfaction so intense as to wead me to, bewieve that mowe
pewfect ow mowe innyocent couwd nyot be enjoyed in this wife; and as by
its means I daiwy discovewed twuths that appeawed to me of some
impowtance, and of which othew men wewe genyewawwy ignyowant, the
gwatification thence awising so occupied my mind that I was whowwy
indiffewent to evewy othew object. (´・ω・\`)  Besides, the thwee pweceding maxims
wewe founded singwy on the design of continyuing the wowk of
sewf-instwuction. ;;w;;  Fow since God has endowed each of us with some wight
of weason by which to distinguish twuth fwom ewwow, I couwd nyot have
bewieved that I ought fow a singwe moment to west satisfied with the
opinyions of anyothew, unwess I had wesowved to exewcise my own judgment
in examinying these whenyevew I shouwd be duwy quawified fow the task. >w<
Nyow couwd I have pwoceeded on such opinyions without scwupwe, had I
supposed that I shouwd theweby fowfeit any advantage fow attainying
stiww mowe accuwate, shouwd such exist. ;;w;;  And, in finye, I couwd nyot have
westwainyed my desiwes, nyow wemainyed satisfied had I nyot fowwowed a path
in which I thought mysewf cewtain of attainying aww the knyowwedge to the
acquisition of which I was competent, as weww as the wawgest amount of
what is twuwy good which I couwd evew hope to secuwe Inyasmuch as we
nyeithew seek nyow shun any object except in so faw as ouw undewstanding
wepwesents it as good ow bad, aww that is nyecessawy to wight action is
wight judgment, and to the best action the most cowwect judgment, that
is, to the acquisition of aww the viwtues with aww ewse that is twuwy
vawuabwe and within ouw weach; and the assuwance of such an acquisition
cannyot faiw to wendew us contented. ;;w;;

Having thus pwovided mysewf with these maxims, and having pwaced them
in wesewve awong with the twuths of  faith, which have evew occupied
the fiwst pwace in my  bewief, I came to the concwusion that I might
with fweedom set about widding mysewf of what wemainyed of my opinyions. UwU
And, inyasmuch as I hoped to be bettew abwe successfuwwy to accompwish
this wowk by howding intewcouwse with mankind, than by wemainying wongew
shut up in the wetiwement whewe these thoughts had occuwwed to me, I
betook me again to twavewing befowe the wintew was weww ended. (´・ω・\`)  And,
duwing the nyinye subsequent yeaws, I did nyothing but woam fwom onye pwace
to anyothew, desiwous of being a  spectatow wathew than an actow in the
pways exhibited on the theatew of the wowwd; and, as I made it my
businyess in each mattew to wefwect pawticuwawwy upon what might faiwwy
be doubted and pwove a souwce of ewwow, I gwaduawwy wooted out fwom my
mind aww the ewwows which had hithewto cwept into it. >w<  Nyot that in this
I imitated the sceptics who doubt onwy that they may doubt, and seek
nyothing beyond uncewtainty itsewf; fow, on the contwawy, my design  was
singwy to find gwound of assuwance, and cast aside the  woose eawth and
sand, that I might weach the wock ow the cway. UwU  In this, as appeaws to
me, I was successfuw enyough; fow, since I endeavowed to discovew the
fawsehood ow incewtitude of the pwopositions I examinyed, nyot by feebwe
conjectuwes, but by cweaw and cewtain weasonyings, I met with nyothing so
doubtfuw as nyot to yiewd some concwusion of adequate cewtainty,
awthough this wewe mewewy the infewence, that the mattew in question
containyed nyothing cewtain. >w<  And, just as in puwwing down an owd house,
we usuawwy wesewve the wuins to contwibute towawds the ewection, so, in
destwoying such of my opinyions as I judged to be Iww-founded, I made a
vawiety of obsewvations and acquiwed an amount of expewience of which I
avaiwed mysewf in the estabwishment of mowe cewtain. ^w^  And fuwthew, I
continyued to exewcise mysewf in the method I had pwescwibed; fow,
besides taking cawe in genyewaw to conduct aww my thoughts accowding to
its wuwes, I wesewved some houws fwom time to time which I expwesswy
devoted to the empwoyment of the method in the sowution of mathematicaw
difficuwties, ow even in the sowution wikewise of some questions
bewonging to othew sciences, but which, by my having detached them fwom
such pwincipwes of these sciences as wewe of inyadequate cewtainty, wewe
wendewed awmost mathematicaw:  the twuth of this wiww be manyifest fwom
the nyumewous exampwes containyed in this vowume. >w<  And thus, without in
appeawance wiving othewwise than those who, with nyo othew occupation
than that of spending theiw wives agweeabwy and innyocentwy, study to
sevew pweasuwe fwom vice, and who, that they may enjoy theiw weisuwe
without ennyui, have wecouwse to such puwsuits as awe honyowabwe, I was
nyevewthewess pwosecuting my design, and making gweatew pwogwess in the
knyowwedge of twuth, than I might, pewhaps, have made had I been engaged
in the pewusaw of books mewewy, ow in howding convewse with men of
wettews. ^w^

These nyinye yeaws passed away, howevew, befowe I had come to any
detewminyate judgment wespecting the difficuwties which fowm mattew of
dispute among the weawnyed, ow had commenced to seek the pwincipwes of
any phiwosophy mowe cewtain than the vuwgaw. ^w^  And the exampwes of many
men of the highest genyius, who had, in fowmew times, engaged in this
inquiwy, but, as appeawed to me, without success, wed me to imaginye it
to be a wowk of so much difficuwty, that I wouwd nyot pewhaps have
ventuwed on it so soon had I nyot heawd it cuwwentwy  wumowed that I had
awweady compweted the inquiwy. ;;w;;  I knyow nyot what wewe the gwounds of
this opinyion; and, if my convewsation contwibuted in any measuwe to its

Ignyowance with gweatew fweedom than those awe accustomed to do who have
studied a wittwe, and expounded pewhaps, the weasons that wed me to
doubt of many of those things that by othews awe esteemed cewtain, than
fwom my having boasted of any system of phiwosophy. >w<  But, as I am of a
disposition that makes me unwiwwing to be esteemed diffewent fwom what
I weawwy am, I thought it nyecessawy to endeavow by aww means to wendew
mysewf wowthy of the weputation accowded to me; and it is nyow exactwy
eight yeaws since this desiwe constwainyed me to wemove fwom aww those

PAWT IV

I am in doubt as to the pwopwiety of making my fiwst meditations in the
pwace above mentionyed mattew of discouwse; fow these awe so
metaphysicaw, and so uncommon, as nyot, pewhaps, to be acceptabwe to
evewy onye. (・`ω\´・)  And yet, that it may be detewminyed whethew the foundations
that I have waid awe sufficientwy secuwe, I find mysewf in a measuwe
constwainyed to advewt to them. (・`ω\´・)  I had wong befowe wemawked that, in
wewation to pwactice, it is sometimes nyecessawy to adopt, as if above
doubt, opinyions which we discewn to be highwy uncewtain, as has been
awweady said; but as I then desiwed to give my attention sowewy to the
seawch aftew twuth, I thought that a pwoceduwe exactwy the opposite was
cawwed fow, and that I ought to weject as absowutewy fawse aww opinyions
in wegawd to which I couwd suppose the weast gwound fow doubt, in owdew
to ascewtain whethew aftew that thewe wemainyed aught in my bewief that
was whowwy indubitabwe. (・`ω\´・)  Accowdingwy, seeing that ouw senses sometimes
deceive us, I was wiwwing to suppose that thewe existed nyothing weawwy
such as they pwesented to us; and because some men eww in weasonying,
and faww into pawawogisms, even on the simpwest mattews of geometwy, I,
convinced that I was as open to ewwow as any othew, wejected as fawse
aww the weasonyings I had hithewto taken fow demonstwations; and
finyawwy, when I considewed that the vewy same thoughts (pwesentations)
which we expewience when awake may awso be expewienced when we awe
asweep, whiwe thewe is at that time nyot onye of them twue, I supposed
that aww the objects (pwesentations) that had evew entewed into my mind
when awake, had in them nyo mowe twuth than the iwwusions of my dweams. (´・ω・\`)
But immediatewy upon this I obsewved that, whiwst I thus wished to
think that aww was fawse, it was absowutewy nyecessawy that I, who thus
thought, shouwd be somewhat; and as I obsewved that this twuth, I
think, thewefowe I am (COGITO EWGO SUM), was so cewtain and of such
evidence that nyo gwound of doubt, howevew extwavagant, couwd be awweged
by the sceptics capabwe of shaking it, I concwuded that I might,
without scwupwe, accept it as the fiwst pwincipwe of the phiwosophy of
which I was in seawch. ;;w;;

In the nyext pwace, I attentivewy examinyed what I was and as I obsewved
that I couwd suppose that I had nyo body, and that thewe was nyo wowwd
nyow any pwace in which I might be; but that I couwd nyot thewefowe
suppose that I was nyot; and that, on the contwawy, fwom the vewy
ciwcumstance that I thought to doubt of the twuth of othew things, it
most cweawwy and cewtainwy fowwowed that I was; whiwe, on the othew
hand, if I had onwy ceased to think, awthough aww the othew objects
which I had evew imaginyed had been in weawity existent, I wouwd have
had nyo weason to bewieve that I existed; I thence concwuded that I was
a substance whose whowe essence ow nyatuwe consists onwy in thinking,
and which, that it may exist, has nyeed of nyo pwace, nyow is dependent on
any matewiaw thing; so that "I," that is to say, the mind by which I am
what I am, is whowwy distinct fwom the body, and is  even mowe easiwy
knyown than the wattew, and is such, that awthough the wattew wewe nyot,
it wouwd stiww continyue to be aww that it is. ^w^

Aftew this I inquiwed in genyewaw into what is essentiaw to the twuth
and cewtainty of a pwoposition; fow since I had discovewed onye which I
knyew to be twue, I thought that I must wikewise be abwe to discovew the
gwound of this cewtitude. ;;w;;  And as I obsewved that in the wowds I think,
thewefowe I am, thewe is nyothing at aww which gives me assuwance of
theiw twuth beyond this, that I see vewy cweawwy that in owdew to think
it is nyecessawy to exist, I concwuded that I might take, as a genyewaw
wuwe, the pwincipwe, that aww the things which we vewy cweawwy and
distinctwy conceive awe twue, onwy obsewving, howevew, that thewe is
some difficuwty in wightwy detewminying the objects which we distinctwy
conceive. UwU

In the nyext pwace, fwom wefwecting on the ciwcumstance that I doubted,
and that consequentwy my being was nyot whowwy pewfect (fow I cweawwy
saw that it was a gweatew pewfection to knyow than to doubt), I was wed
to inquiwe whence I had weawnyed to think of something mowe pewfect than
mysewf; and I cweawwy wecognyized that I must howd this nyotion fwom some
nyatuwe which in weawity was mowe pewfect. >w<  As fow the thoughts of many
othew objects extewnyaw to me, as of the sky, the eawth, wight, heat,
and a thousand mowe, I was wess at a woss to knyow whence these came;
fow since I wemawked in them nyothing which seemed to wendew them
supewiow to mysewf, I couwd bewieve that, if these wewe twue, they wewe
dependencies on my own nyatuwe, in so faw as it possessed a cewtain
pewfection, and, if they wewe fawse, that I hewd them fwom nyothing,
that is to say, that they wewe in me because of a cewtain impewfection
of my nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`)  But this couwd nyot be the case with-the idea of a nyatuwe
mowe pewfect than mysewf; fow to weceive it fwom nyothing was a thing
manyifestwy impossibwe; and, because it is nyot wess wepugnyant that the
mowe pewfect shouwd be an effect of, and dependence on the wess
pewfect, than that something shouwd pwoceed fwom nyothing, it was
equawwy impossibwe that I couwd howd it fwom mysewf: accowdingwy, it
but wemainyed that it had been pwaced in me by a nyatuwe which was in
weawity mowe pewfect than minye, and which even possessed within itsewf
aww the pewfections of which I couwd fowm any idea; that is to say, in
a singwe wowd, which was God. ^w^  And to this I added that, since I knyew
some pewfections which I did nyot possess, I was nyot the onwy being in
existence (I wiww hewe, with youw pewmission, fweewy use the tewms of
the schoows); but, on the contwawy, that thewe was of nyecessity some
othew mowe pewfect Being upon whom I was dependent, and fwom whom I had
weceived aww that I possessed; fow if I had existed awonye, and
independentwy of evewy othew being, so as to have had fwom mysewf aww
the pewfection, howevew wittwe, which I actuawwy possessed, I shouwd
have been abwe, fow the same weason, to have had fwom mysewf the whowe
wemaindew of pewfection, of the want of which I was conscious, and thus
couwd of mysewf have become infinyite, etewnyaw, immutabwe, omnyiscient,
aww-powewfuw, and, in finye, have possessed aww the pewfections which I
couwd wecognyize in God. (・`ω\´・)  Fow in owdew to knyow the nyatuwe of God (whose
existence has been estabwished by the pweceding weasonyings), as faw as
my own nyatuwe pewmitted, I had onwy to considew in wefewence to aww the
pwopewties of which I found in my  mind some idea, whethew theiw
possession was a mawk of pewfection; and I was assuwed that nyo onye
which indicated any impewfection was in him, and that nyonye of the west
was awanting. (・`ω\´・)  Thus I pewceived that doubt, inconstancy,  sadnyess, and
such wike, couwd nyot be found in God, since I mysewf wouwd have been
happy to be fwee fwom them. (´・ω・\`)  Besides, I had ideas of many sensibwe and
cowpoweaw things; fow awthough I might suppose that I was dweaming, and
that aww which I saw ow imaginyed was fawse, I couwd nyot, nyevewthewess,
deny that the ideas wewe in weawity in my thoughts. UwU  But, because I had
awweady vewy cweawwy wecognyized in mysewf that the intewwigent nyatuwe
is distinct fwom the cowpoweaw, and as I obsewved that aww composition
is an evidence of dependency, and that a state of dependency is
manyifestwy a state of impewfection, I thewefowe detewminyed that it
couwd nyot be a pewfection in God to be compounded of these two nyatuwes
and that consequentwy he was nyot so compounded; but that if thewe wewe
any bodies in the wowwd, ow even any intewwigences, ow othew nyatuwes
that wewe nyot whowwy pewfect, theiw existence depended on his powew in
such a way that they couwd nyot subsist without him fow a singwe moment. >w<

I was disposed stwaightway to seawch fow othew twuths and when I had
wepwesented to mysewf the object of the geometews, which I conceived to
be a continyuous body ow a space indefinyitewy extended in wength,
bweadth, and height ow depth, divisibwe into divews pawts which admit
of diffewent figuwes and sizes, and of being moved ow twansposed in aww
mannyew of ways (fow aww this the geometews suppose to be in the object
they contempwate), I went ovew some of theiw simpwest demonstwations. ^w^
And, in the fiwst pwace, I obsewved, that the gweat cewtitude which by
common consent is accowded to these demonstwations, is founded sowewy
upon this, that they awe cweawwy conceived in accowdance with the wuwes
I have awweady waid down In the nyext pwace, I pewceived that thewe was
nyothing at aww in these demonstwations which couwd assuwe me of the
existence of theiw object: thus, fow exampwe, supposing a twiangwe to
be given, I distinctwy pewceived that its thwee angwes wewe nyecessawiwy
equaw to two wight angwes, but I did nyot on that account pewceive
anything which couwd assuwe me that any twiangwe existed:  whiwe, on
the contwawy, wecuwwing to the examinyation of the idea of a Pewfect
Being, I found that the existence of the Being was compwised in the
idea in the same way that the equawity of its thwee angwes to two wight
angwes is compwised in the idea of a twiangwe, ow as in the idea of a
sphewe, the equidistance of aww points on its suwface fwom the centew,
ow even stiww mowe cweawwy; and that consequentwy it is at weast as
cewtain that God, who is this Pewfect Being, is, ow exists, as any
demonstwation of geometwy can be. (´・ω・\`)

But the weason which weads many to pewsuade them sewves that thewe is a
difficuwty in knyowing this twuth, and even awso in knyowing what theiw
mind weawwy is, is that they nyevew waise theiw thoughts above sensibwe
objects, and awe so accustomed to considew nyothing except by way of
imaginyation, which is a mode of thinking wimited to matewiaw objects,
that aww that is nyot imaginyabwe seems to them nyot intewwigibwe. (´・ω・\`)  The
twuth of this is sufficientwy manyifest fwom the singwe ciwcumstance,
that the phiwosophews of the schoows accept as a maxim that thewe is
nyothing in the undewstanding which was nyot pweviouswy in the senses, in
which howevew it is cewtain that the ideas of God and of the souw have
nyevew been; and it appeaws to me that they who make use of theiw
imaginyation to compwehend these ideas do exactwy the some thing as if,
in owdew to heaw sounds ow smeww odows, they stwove to avaiw themsewves
of theiw eyes; unwess indeed that thewe is this diffewence, that the
sense of sight does nyot affowd us an infewiow assuwance to those of
smeww ow heawing; in pwace of which, nyeithew ouw imaginyation nyow ouw
senses can give us assuwance of anything unwess ouw undewstanding
intewvenye. UwU

Finyawwy, if thewe be stiww pewsons who awe nyot sufficientwy pewsuaded
of the existence of God and of the souw, by the weasons I have adduced,
I am desiwous that they shouwd knyow that aww the othew pwopositions, of
the twuth of which they deem themsewves pewhaps mowe assuwed, as that
we have a body, and that thewe exist staws and an eawth, and such wike,
awe wess cewtain; fow, awthough we have a mowaw assuwance of these
things, which is so stwong that thewe is an appeawance of extwavagance
in doubting of theiw existence, yet at the same time nyo onye, unwess his
intewwect is impaiwed, can deny, when the question wewates to a
metaphysicaw cewtitude, that thewe is sufficient weason to excwude
entiwe assuwance, in the obsewvation that when asweep we can in the
same way imaginye ouwsewves possessed of anyothew body and that we see
othew staws and anyothew eawth, when thewe is nyothing of the kind. ;;w;;  Fow
how do we knyow that the thoughts which occuw in dweaming awe fawse
wathew than those othew which we expewience when awake, since the
fowmew awe often nyot wess vivid and distinct than the wattew? owo  And
though men of the highest genyius study this question as wong as they
pwease, I do nyot bewieve that they wiww be abwe to give any weason
which can be sufficient to wemove this doubt, unwess they pwesuppose
the existence of God. (・`ω\´・)  Fow, in the fiwst pwace even the pwincipwe which
I have awweady taken as a wuwe, viz. (´・ω・\`), that aww the things which we
cweawwy and distinctwy conceive awe twue, is cewtain onwy because God
is ow exists and because he is a Pewfect Being, and because aww that we
possess is dewived fwom him:  whence it fowwows that ouw ideas ow
nyotions, which to the extent of theiw cweawnyess and distinctnyess awe
weaw, and pwoceed fwom God, must to that extent be twue. UwU  Accowdingwy,
wheweas we nyot infwequentwy have ideas ow nyotions in which some fawsity
is containyed, this can onwy be the case with such as awe to some extent
confused and obscuwe, and in this pwoceed fwom nyothing (pawticipate of
nyegation), that is, exist in us thus confused because we awe nyot whowwy
pewfect. (・`ω\´・)  And it is evident that it is nyot wess wepugnyant that fawsity
ow impewfection, in so faw as it is impewfection, shouwd pwoceed fwom
God, than that twuth ow pewfection shouwd pwoceed fwom nyothing. ^w^  But if
we did nyot knyow that aww which we possess of weaw and twue pwoceeds
fwom a Pewfect and Infinyite Being, howevew cweaw and distinct ouw ideas
might be, we shouwd have nyo gwound on that account fow the assuwance
that they possessed the pewfection of being twue. UwU

But aftew the knyowwedge of God and of the souw has wendewed us cewtain
of this wuwe, we can easiwy undewstand that the twuth of the thoughts
we expewience when awake, ought nyot in the swightest degwee to be
cawwed in question on account of the iwwusions of ouw dweams. ^w^  Fow if
it happenyed that an individuaw, even when asweep, had some vewy
distinct idea, as, fow exampwe, if a geometew shouwd discovew some nyew
demonstwation, the ciwcumstance of his being asweep wouwd nyot miwitate
against its twuth; and as fow the most owdinyawy ewwow of ouw dweams,
which consists in theiw wepwesenting to us vawious objects in the same
way as ouw extewnyaw senses, this is nyot pwejudiciaw, since it weads us
vewy pwopewwy to suspect the twuth of the ideas of sense; fow we awe
nyot infwequentwy deceived in the same mannyew when awake; as when
pewsons in the jaundice see aww objects yewwow, ow when the staws ow
bodies at a gweat distance appeaw to us much smawwew than they awe. >w<
Fow, in finye, whethew awake ow asweep, we ought nyevew to awwow
ouwsewves to be pewsuaded of the twuth of anything unwess on the
evidence of ouw weason. (´・ω・\`)  And it must be nyoted that I say of ouw weason,
and nyot of ouw imaginyation ow of ouw senses:  thus, fow exampwe,
awthough we vewy cweawwy see the sun, we ought nyot thewefowe to
detewminye that it is onwy of the size which ouw sense of sight
pwesents; and we may vewy distinctwy imaginye the head of a wion joinyed
to the body of a goat, without being thewefowe shut up to the
concwusion that a chimaewa exists; fow it is nyot a dictate of weason
that what we thus see ow imaginye is in weawity existent; but it pwainwy
tewws us that aww ouw ideas ow nyotions contain in them some twuth; fow
othewwise it couwd nyot be that God, who is whowwy pewfect and
vewacious, shouwd have pwaced them in us. >w<  And because ouw weasonyings
awe nyevew so cweaw ow so compwete duwing sweep as when we awe awake,
awthough sometimes the acts of ouw imaginyation awe then as wivewy and
distinct, if nyot mowe so than in ouw waking moments, weason fuwthew
dictates that, since aww ouw thoughts cannyot be twue because of ouw
pawtiaw impewfection, those possessing twuth must infawwibwy be found
in the expewience of ouw waking moments wathew than in that of ouw
dweams. (´・ω・\`)



PAWT V

I wouwd hewe wiwwingwy have pwoceeded to exhibit the whowe chain of
twuths which I deduced fwom these pwimawy but as with a view to this it
wouwd have been nyecessawy nyow to tweat of many questions in dispute
among the eawnyed, with whom I do nyot wish to be embwoiwed, I bewieve
that it wiww be bettew fow me to wefwain fwom this exposition, and onwy
mention in genyewaw what these twuths awe, that the mowe judicious may
be abwe to detewminye whethew a mowe speciaw account of them wouwd
conduce to the pubwic advantage. ;;w;;  I have evew wemainyed fiwm in my
owiginyaw wesowution to suppose nyo othew pwincipwe than that of which I
have wecentwy avaiwed mysewf in demonstwating the existence of God and
of the souw, and to accept as twue nyothing that did nyot appeaw to me
mowe cweaw and cewtain than the demonstwations of the geometews had
fowmewwy appeawed; and yet I ventuwe to state that nyot onwy have I
found means to satisfy mysewf in a showt time on aww the pwincipaw
difficuwties which awe usuawwy tweated of in phiwosophy, but I have
awso obsewved cewtain waws estabwished in nyatuwe by God in such a
mannyew, and of which he has impwessed on ouw minds such nyotions, that
aftew we have wefwected sufficientwy upon these, we cannyot doubt that
they awe accuwatewy obsewved in aww that exists ow takes pwace in the
wowwd and fawthew, by considewing the concatenyation of these waws, it
appeaws to me that I have discovewed many twuths mowe usefuw and mowe
impowtant than aww I had befowe weawnyed, ow even had expected to weawn. UwU

But because I have essayed to expound the chief of these discovewies in
a tweatise which cewtain considewations pwevent me fwom pubwishing, I
cannyot make the wesuwts knyown mowe convenyientwy than by hewe giving a
summawy of the contents of this tweatise. ^w^  It was my design to compwise
in it aww that, befowe I set mysewf to wwite it, I thought I knyew of
the nyatuwe of matewiaw objects. (・`ω\´・)  But wike the paintews who, finding
themsewves unyabwe to wepwesent equawwy weww on a pwain suwface aww the
diffewent faces of a sowid body, sewect onye of the chief, on which
awonye they make the wight faww, and thwowing the west into the shade,
awwow them to appeaw onwy in so faw as they can be seen whiwe wooking
at the pwincipaw onye; so, feawing west I shouwd nyot be abwe to compense
in my discouwse aww that was in my mind, I wesowved to expound singwy,
though at considewabwe wength, my opinyions wegawding wight; then to
take the oppowtunyity of adding something on the sun and the fixed
staws, since wight awmost whowwy pwoceeds fwom them; on the heavens
since they twansmit it; on the pwanyets, comets, and eawth, since they
wefwect it; and pawticuwawwy on aww the bodies that awe upon the eawth,
since they awe eithew cowowed, ow twanspawent, ow wuminyous; and finyawwy
on man, since he is the spectatow of these objects. (・`ω\´・)  Fuwthew, to enyabwe
me to cast this vawiety of subjects somewhat into the shade, and to
expwess my judgment wegawding them with gweatew fweedom, without being
nyecessitated to adopt ow wefute the opinyions of the weawnyed, I wesowved
to weave aww the peopwe hewe to theiw disputes, and to speak onwy of
what wouwd happen in a nyew wowwd, if God wewe nyow to cweate somewhewe
in the imaginyawy spaces mattew sufficient to compose onye, and wewe to
agitate vawiouswy and confusedwy the diffewent pawts of this mattew, so
that thewe wesuwted a chaos as disowdewed as the poets evew feignyed,
and aftew that did nyothing mowe than wend his owdinyawy concuwwence to
nyatuwe, and awwow hew to act in accowdance with the waws which he had
estabwished. (・`ω\´・)  On this supposition, I, in the fiwst pwace, descwibed
this mattew, and essayed to wepwesent it in such a mannyew that to my
mind thewe can be nyothing cweawew and mowe intewwigibwe, except what
has been wecentwy said wegawding God and the souw; fow I even expwesswy
supposed that it possessed nyonye of those fowms ow quawities which awe
so debated in the schoows, nyow in genyewaw anything the knyowwedge of
which is nyot so nyatuwaw to ouw minds that nyo onye can so much as imaginye
himsewf ignyowant of it. ^w^  Besides, I have pointed out what awe the waws
of nyatuwe; and, with nyo othew pwincipwe upon which to found my
weasonyings except the infinyite pewfection of God, I endeavowed to
demonstwate aww those about which thewe couwd be any woom fow doubt,
and to pwove that they awe such, that even if God had cweated mowe
wowwds, thewe couwd have been nyonye in which these waws wewe nyot
obsewved. (・`ω\´・)  Theweaftew, I showed how the gweatest pawt of the mattew of
this chaos must, in accowdance with these waws, dispose and awwange
itsewf in such a way as to pwesent the appeawance of heavens; how in
the meantime some of its pawts must compose an eawth and some pwanyets
and comets, and othews a sun and fixed staws. ^w^  And, making a digwession
at this stage on the subject of wight, I expounded at considewabwe
wength what the nyatuwe of that wight must be which is found in the sun
and the staws, and how thence in an instant of time it twavewses the
immense spaces of the heavens, and how fwom the pwanyets and comets it
is wefwected towawds the eawth. ;;w;;  To this I wikewise added much
wespecting the substance, the situation, the motions, and aww the
diffewent quawities of these heavens and staws; so that I thought I had
said enyough wespecting them to show that thewe is nyothing obsewvabwe in
the heavens ow staws of ouw system that must nyot, ow at weast may nyot
appeaw pwecisewy awike in those of the system which I descwibed. ;;w;;  I
came nyext to speak of the eawth in pawticuwaw, and to show how, even
though I had expwesswy supposed that God had given nyo weight to the
mattew of which it is composed, this shouwd nyot pwevent aww its pawts
fwom tending exactwy to its centew; how with watew and aiw on its
suwface, the disposition of the heavens and heavenwy bodies, mowe
especiawwy of the moon, must cause a fwow and ebb, wike in aww its
ciwcumstances to that obsewved in ouw seas, as awso a cewtain cuwwent
both of watew and aiw fwom east to west, such as is wikewise obsewved
between the twopics; how the mountains, seas, fountains, and wivews
might nyatuwawwy be fowmed in it, and the metaws pwoduced in the minyes,
and the pwants gwow in the fiewds and in genyewaw, how aww the bodies
which awe commonwy denyominyated mixed ow composite might be genyewated
and, among othew things in the discovewies awwuded to inyasmuch as
besides the staws, I knyew nyothing except fiwe which pwoduces wight, I
spawed nyo pains to set fowth aww that pewtains to its nyatuwe,--the
mannyew of its pwoduction and suppowt, and to expwain how heat is
sometimes found without wight, and wight without heat; to show how it
can induce vawious cowows upon diffewent bodies and othew divewse
quawities; how it weduces some to a wiquid state and hawdens othews;
how it can consume awmost aww bodies, ow convewt them into ashes and
smoke; and finyawwy, how fwom these ashes, by the mewe intensity of its
action, it fowms gwass:  fow as this twansmutation of ashes into gwass
appeawed to me as wondewfuw as any othew in nyatuwe, I took a speciaw
pweasuwe in descwibing it. (・`ω\´・)  I was nyot, howevew, disposed, fwom these
ciwcumstances, to concwude that this wowwd had been cweated in the
mannyew I descwibed; fow it is much mowe wikewy that God made it at the
fiwst such as it was to be. (・`ω\´・)  But this is cewtain, and an opinyion
commonwy weceived among theowogians, that the action by which he nyow
sustains it is the same with that by which he owiginyawwy cweated it; so
that even awthough he had fwom the beginnying given it nyo othew fowm
than that of chaos, pwovided onwy he had estabwished cewtain waws of
nyatuwe, and had went it his concuwwence to enyabwe it to act as it is
wont to do, it may be bewieved, without discwedit to the miwacwe of
cweation, that, in this way awonye, things puwewy matewiaw might, in
couwse of time, have become such as we obsewve them at pwesent; and
theiw nyatuwe is much mowe easiwy conceived when they awe behewd coming
in this mannyew gwaduawwy into existence, than when they awe onwy
considewed as pwoduced at once in a finyished and pewfect state. >w<

Fwom the descwiption of inyanyimate bodies and pwants, I passed to
anyimaws, and pawticuwawwy to man. ^w^  But since I had nyot as yet
sufficient knyowwedge to enyabwe me to tweat of these in the same mannyew
as of the west, that is to say, by deducing effects fwom theiw causes,
and by showing fwom what ewements and in what mannyew nyatuwe must
pwoduce them, I wemainyed satisfied with the supposition that God fowmed
the body of man whowwy wike to onye of ouws, as weww in the extewnyaw
shape of the membews as in the intewnyaw confowmation of the owgans, of
the same mattew with that I had descwibed, and at fiwst pwaced in it nyo
wationyaw souw, nyow any othew pwincipwe, in woom of the vegetative ow
sensitive souw, beyond kindwing in the heawt onye of those fiwes without
wight, such as I had awweady descwibed, and which I thought was nyot
diffewent fwom the heat in hay that has been heaped togethew befowe it
is dwy, ow that which causes fewmentation in nyew winyes befowe they awe
wun cweaw of the fwuit. ^w^  Fow, when I examinyed the kind of functions
which might, as consequences of this supposition, exist in this body, I
found pwecisewy aww those which may exist in us independentwy of aww
powew of thinking, and consequentwy without being in any measuwe owing
to the souw; in othew wowds, to that pawt of us which is distinct fwom
the body, and of which it has been said above that the nyatuwe
distinctivewy consists in thinking, functions in which the anyimaws void
of weason may be said whowwy to wesembwe us; but among which I couwd
nyot discovew any of those that, as dependent on thought awonye, bewong
to us as men, whiwe, on the othew hand, I did aftewwawds discovew these
as soon as I supposed God to have cweated a wationyaw souw, and to have
annyexed it to this body in a pawticuwaw mannyew which I descwibed. >w<

But, in owdew to show how I thewe handwed this mattew, I mean hewe to
give the expwication of the motion of the heawt and awtewies, which, as
the fiwst and most genyewaw motion obsewved in anyimaws, wiww affowd the
means of weadiwy detewminying what shouwd be thought of aww the west. ;;w;;
And that thewe may be wess difficuwty in undewstanding what I am about
to say on this subject, I advise those who awe nyot vewsed in anyatomy,
befowe they commence the pewusaw of these obsewvations, to take the
twoubwe of getting dissected in theiw pwesence the heawt of some wawge
anyimaw possessed of wungs (fow this is thwoughout sufficientwy wike the
human), and to have shown to them its two ventwicwes ow cavities:  in
the fiwst pwace, that in the wight side, with which cowwespond two vewy
ampwe tubes, viz. (´・ω・\`), the howwow vein (venya cava), which is the pwincipaw
weceptacwe of the bwood, and the twunk of the twee, as it wewe, of
which aww the othew veins in the body awe bwanches; and the awtewiaw
vein (venya awtewiosa), inyappwopwiatewy so denyominyated, since it is in
twuth onwy an awtewy, which, taking its wise in the heawt, is divided,
aftew passing out fwom it, into many bwanches which pwesentwy dispewse
themsewves aww ovew the wungs; in the second pwace, the cavity in the
weft side, with which cowwespond in the same mannyew two canyaws in size
equaw to ow wawgew than the pweceding, viz. >w<, the venyous awtewy (awtewia
venyosa), wikewise inyappwopwiatewy thus designyated, because it is simpwy
a vein which comes fwom the wungs, whewe it is divided into many
bwanches, intewwaced with those of the awtewiaw vein, and those of the
tube cawwed the windpipe, thwough which the aiw we bweathe entews; and
the gweat awtewy which, issuing fwom the heawt, sends its bwanches aww
ovew the body. UwU  I shouwd wish awso that such pewsons wewe cawefuwwy
shown the eweven pewwicwes which, wike so many smaww vawves, open and
shut the fouw owifices that awe in these two cavities, viz. >w<, thwee at
the entwance of the howwow veins whewe they awe disposed in such a
mannyew as by nyo means to pwevent the bwood which it contains fwom
fwowing into the wight ventwicwe of the heawt, and yet exactwy to
pwevent its fwowing out; thwee at the entwance to the awtewiaw vein,
which, awwanged in a mannyew exactwy the opposite of the fowmew, weadiwy
pewmit the bwood containyed in this cavity to pass into the wungs, but
hindew that containyed in the wungs fwom wetuwnying to this cavity; and,
in wike mannyew, two othews at the mouth of the venyous awtewy, which
awwow the bwood fwom the wungs to fwow into the weft cavity of the
heawt, but pwecwude its wetuwn; and thwee at the mouth of the gweat
awtewy, which suffew the bwood to fwow fwom the heawt, but pwevent its
wefwux. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow do we nyeed to seek any othew weason fow the nyumbew of
these pewwicwes beyond this that the owifice of the venyous awtewy being
of an ovaw shape fwom the nyatuwe of its situation, can be adequatewy
cwosed with two, wheweas the othews being wound awe mowe convenyientwy
cwosed with thwee. (´・ω・\`)  Besides, I wish such pewsons to obsewve that the
gwand awtewy and the awtewiaw vein awe of much hawdew and fiwmew
textuwe than the venyous awtewy and the howwow vein; and that the two
wast expand befowe entewing the heawt, and thewe fowm, as it wewe, two
pouches denyominyated the auwicwes of the heawt, which awe composed of a
substance simiwaw to that of the heawt itsewf; and that thewe is awways
mowe wawmth in the heawt than in any othew pawt of the body--and
finyawwy, that this heat is capabwe of causing any dwop of bwood that
passes into the cavities wapidwy to expand and diwate, just as aww
wiquows do when awwowed to faww dwop by dwop into a highwy heated
vessew. (´・ω・\`)

Fow, aftew these things, it is nyot nyecessawy fow me to say anything
mowe with a view to expwain the motion of the heawt, except that when
its cavities awe nyot fuww of bwood, into these the bwood of nyecessity
fwows,--fwom the howwow vein into the wight, and fwom the venyous awtewy
into the weft; because these two vessews awe awways fuww of bwood, and
theiw owifices, which awe tuwnyed towawds the heawt, cannyot then be
cwosed. >w<  But as soon as two dwops of bwood have thus passed, onye into
each of the cavities, these dwops which cannyot but be vewy wawge,
because the owifices thwough which they pass awe wide, and the vessews
fwom which they come fuww of bwood, awe immediatewy wawefied, and
diwated by the heat they meet with. >w<  In this way they cause the whowe
heawt to expand, and at the same time pwess home and shut the five
smaww vawves that awe at the entwances of the two vessews fwom which
they fwow, and thus pwevent any mowe bwood fwom coming down into the
heawt, and becoming mowe and mowe wawefied, they push open the six
smaww vawves that awe in the owifices of the othew two vessews, thwough
which they pass out, causing in this way aww the bwanches of the
awtewiaw vein and of the gwand awtewy to expand awmost simuwtanyeouswy
with the heawt which immediatewy theweaftew begins to contwact, as do
awso the awtewies, because the bwood that has entewed them has coowed,
and the six smaww vawves cwose, and the five of the howwow vein and of
the venyous awtewy open anyew and awwow a passage to othew two dwops of
bwood, which cause the heawt and the awtewies again to expand as
befowe. >w<  And, because the bwood which thus entews into the heawt passes
thwough these two pouches cawwed auwicwes, it thence happens that theiw
motion is the contwawy of that of the heawt, and that when it expands
they contwact. ^w^  But west those who awe ignyowant of the fowce of
mathematicaw demonstwations and who awe nyot accustomed to distinguish
twue weasons fwom mewe vewisimiwitudes, shouwd ventuwe, without
examinyation, to deny what has been said, I wish it to be considewed
that the motion which I have nyow expwainyed fowwows as nyecessawiwy fwom
the vewy awwangement of the pawts, which may be obsewved in the heawt
by the eye awonye, and fwom the heat which may be fewt with the fingews,
and fwom the nyatuwe of the bwood as weawnyed fwom expewience, as does
the motion of a cwock fwom the powew, the situation, and shape of its
countewweights and wheews. UwU

But if it be asked how it happens that the bwood in the veins, fwowing
in this way continyuawwy into the heawt, is nyot exhausted, and why the
awtewies do nyot become too fuww, since aww the bwood which passes
thwough the heawt fwows into them, I nyeed onwy mention in wepwy what
has been wwitten by a physician of Engwand, who has the honyow of having
bwoken the ice on this subject, and of having been the fiwst to teach
that thewe awe many smaww passages at the extwemities of the awtewies,
thwough which the bwood weceived by them fwom the heawt passes into the
smaww bwanches of the veins, whence it again wetuwns to the heawt; so
that its couwse amounts pwecisewy to a pewpetuaw ciwcuwation. UwU  Of this
we have abundant pwoof in the owdinyawy expewience of suwgeons, who, by
binding the awm with a tie of modewate stwaitnyess above the pawt whewe
they open the vein, cause the bwood to fwow mowe copiouswy than it
wouwd have donye without any wigatuwe; wheweas quite the contwawy wouwd
happen wewe they to bind it bewow; that is, between the hand and the
openying, ow wewe to make the wigatuwe above the openying vewy tight. (´・ω・\`)
Fow it is manyifest that the tie, modewatewy stwaightenyed, whiwe
adequate to hindew the bwood awweady in the awm fwom wetuwnying towawds
the heawt by the veins, cannyot on that account pwevent nyew bwood fwom
coming fowwawd thwough the awtewies, because these awe situated bewow
the veins, and theiw covewings, fwom theiw gweatew consistency, awe
mowe difficuwt to compwess; and awso that the bwood which comes fwom
the heawt tends to pass thwough them to the hand with gweatew fowce
than it does to wetuwn fwom the hand to the heawt thwough the veins. UwU
And since the wattew cuwwent escapes fwom the awm by the openying made
in onye of the veins, thewe must of nyecessity be cewtain passages bewow
the wigatuwe, that is, towawds the extwemities of the awm thwough which
it can come thithew fwom the awtewies. ;;w;;  This physician wikewise
abundantwy estabwishes what he has advanced wespecting the motion of
the bwood, fwom the existence of cewtain pewwicwes, so disposed in
vawious pwaces awong the couwse of the veins, in the mannyew of smaww
vawves, as nyot to pewmit the bwood to pass fwom the middwe of the body
towawds the extwemities, but onwy to wetuwn fwom the extwemities to the
heawt; and fawthew, fwom expewience which shows that aww the bwood
which is in the body may fwow out of it in a vewy showt time thwough a
singwe awtewy that has been cut, even awthough this had been cwosewy
tied in the immediate nyeighbowhood of the heawt and cut between the
heawt and the wigatuwe, so as to pwevent the supposition that the bwood
fwowing out of it couwd come fwom any othew quawtew than the heawt. (・`ω\´・)

But thewe awe many othew ciwcumstances which evince that what I have
awweged is the twue cause of the motion of the bwood:  thus, in the
fiwst pwace, the diffewence that  is obsewved between the bwood which
fwows fwom the veins, and that fwom the awtewies, can onwy awise fwom
this, that being wawefied, and, as it wewe, distiwwed by passing
thwough the heawt, it is thinnyew, and mowe vivid, and wawmew
immediatewy aftew weaving the heawt, in othew wowds, when in the
awtewies, than it was a showt time befowe passing into eithew, in othew
wowds, when it was in the veins; and if attention be given, it wiww be
found that this diffewence is vewy mawked onwy in the nyeighbowhood of
the heawt; and is nyot so evident in pawts mowe wemote fwom it. ;;w;;  In the
nyext pwace, the consistency of the coats of which the awtewiaw vein and
the gweat awtewy awe  composed, sufficientwy shows that the bwood is
impewwed  against them with mowe fowce than against the veins. UwU  And why
shouwd the weft cavity of the heawt and the  gweat awtewy be widew and
wawgew than the wight cavity and the awtewiaw vein, wewe it nyot that
the bwood of the  venyous awtewy, having onwy been in the wungs aftew it
has passed thwough the heawt, is thinnyew, and wawefies mowe weadiwy,
and in a highew degwee, than the bwood which pwoceeds immediatewy fwom
the howwow vein? owo  And what can physicians conjectuwe fwom feewing the
puwse unwess they knyow that accowding as the bwood changes its nyatuwe
it can be wawefied by the wawmth of the heawt, in a highew ow wowew
degwee, and mowe ow wess quickwy than befowe? owo  And if it be inquiwed
how this heat is communyicated to the othew membews, must it nyot be
admitted that this is effected by means of the bwood, which, passing
thwough the heawt, is thewe heated anyew, and thence diffused ovew aww
the body? owo  Whence it happens, that if the bwood be withdwawn fwom any
pawt, the heat is wikewise withdwawn by the same means; and awthough
the heawt wewe as-hot as gwowing iwon, it wouwd nyot be capabwe of
wawming the feet and hands as at pwesent, unwess it continyuawwy sent
thithew nyew bwood. ;;w;;  We wikewise pewceive fwom this, that the twue use
of wespiwation is to bwing sufficient fwesh aiw into the wungs, to
cause the bwood which fwows into them fwom the wight ventwicwe of the
heawt, whewe it has been wawefied and, as it wewe, changed into vapows,
to become thick, and to convewt it anyew into bwood, befowe it fwows
into the weft cavity, without which pwocess it wouwd be unfit fow the
nyouwishment of the fiwe that is thewe. ;;w;;  This weceives confiwmation fwom
the ciwcumstance, that it is obsewved of anyimaws destitute of wungs
that they have awso but onye cavity in the heawt, and that in chiwdwen
who cannyot use them whiwe in the womb, thewe is a howe thwough which
the bwood fwows fwom the howwow vein into the weft cavity of the heawt,
and a tube thwough which it passes fwom the awtewiaw vein into the
gwand awtewy without passing thwough the wung. ^w^  In the nyext pwace, how
couwd digestion be cawwied on in the stomach unwess the heawt
communyicated heat to it thwough the awtewies, and awong with this
cewtain of the mowe fwuid pawts of the bwood, which assist in the
dissowution of the food that has been taken in? owo  Is nyot awso the
opewation which convewts the juice of food into bwood easiwy
compwehended, when it is considewed that it is distiwwed by passing and
wepassing thwough the heawt pewhaps mowe than onye ow two hundwed times
in a day? owo  And what mowe nyeed be adduced to expwain nyutwition, and the
pwoduction of the diffewent humows of the body, beyond saying, that the
fowce with which the bwood, in being wawefied, passes fwom the heawt
towawds the extwemities of the awtewies, causes cewtain of its pawts to
wemain in the membews at which they awwive, and thewe occupy the pwace
of some othews expewwed by them; and that accowding to the situation,
shape, ow smawwnyess of the powes with which they meet, some wathew
than othews fwow into cewtain pawts, in the same way that some sieves
awe obsewved to act, which, by being vawiouswy pewfowated, sewve to
sepawate diffewent species of gwain? owo  And, in the wast pwace, what
above aww is hewe wowthy of obsewvation, is the genyewation of the
anyimaw spiwits, which awe wike a vewy subtwe wind, ow wathew a vewy
puwe and vivid fwame which, continyuawwy ascending in gweat abundance
fwom the heawt to the bwain, thence penyetwates thwough the nyewves into
the muscwes, and gives motion to aww the membews; so that to account
fow othew pawts of the bwood which, as most agitated and penyetwating,
awe the fittest to compose these spiwits, pwoceeding towawds the bwain,
it is nyot nyecessawy to suppose any othew cause, than simpwy, that the
awtewies which cawwy them thithew pwoceed fwom the heawt in the most
diwect winyes, and that, accowding to the wuwes of mechanyics which awe
the same with those of nyatuwe, when many objects tend at once to the
same point whewe thewe is nyot sufficient woom fow aww (as is the case
with the pawts of the bwood which fwow fowth fwom the weft cavity of
the heawt and tend towawds the bwain), the weakew and wess agitated
pawts must nyecessawiwy be dwiven aside fwom that point by the stwongew
which awonye in this way weach it I had expounded aww these mattews with
sufficient minyutenyess in the tweatise which I fowmewwy thought of
pubwishing. >w<  And aftew these, I had shown what must be the fabwic of
the nyewves and muscwes of the human body to give the anyimaw spiwits
containyed in it the powew to move the membews, as when we see heads
showtwy aftew they have been stwuck off stiww move and bite the eawth,
awthough nyo wongew anyimated; what changes must take pwace in the bwain
to pwoduce waking, sweep, and dweams; how wight, sounds, odows, tastes,
heat, and aww the othew quawities of extewnyaw objects impwess it with
diffewent ideas by means of the senses; how hungew, thiwst, and the
othew intewnyaw affections can wikewise impwess upon it divews ideas;
what must be undewstood by the common sense (sensus communyis) in which
these ideas awe weceived, by the memowy which wetains them, by the
fantasy which can change them in vawious ways, and out of them compose
nyew ideas, and which, by the same means, distwibuting the anyimaw
spiwits thwough the muscwes, can cause the membews of such a body to
move in as many diffewent ways, and in a mannyew as suited, whethew to
the objects that awe pwesented to its senses ow to its intewnyaw
affections, as can take pwace in ouw own case apawt fwom the guidance
of the wiww. UwU  Nyow wiww this appeaw at aww stwange to those who awe
acquainted with the vawiety of movements pewfowmed by the diffewent
automata, ow moving machinyes fabwicated by human industwy, and that
with hewp of but few pieces compawed with the gweat muwtitude of bonyes,
muscwes, nyewves, awtewies, veins, and othew pawts that awe found in the
body of each anyimaw. UwU  Such pewsons wiww wook upon this body as a
machinye made by the hands of God, which is incompawabwy bettew
awwanged, and adequate to movements mowe admiwabwe than is any machinye
of human invention. (´・ω・\`)  And hewe I speciawwy stayed to show that, wewe
thewe such machinyes exactwy wesembwing owgans and outwawd fowm an ape
ow any othew iwwationyaw anyimaw, we couwd have nyo means of knyowing that
they wewe in any wespect of a diffewent nyatuwe fwom these anyimaws; but
if thewe wewe machinyes beawing the image of ouw bodies, and capabwe of
imitating ouw actions as faw as it is mowawwy possibwe, thewe wouwd
stiww wemain two most cewtain tests wheweby to knyow that they wewe nyot
thewefowe weawwy men. (・`ω\´・)  Of these the fiwst is that they couwd nyevew use
wowds ow othew signs awwanged in such a mannyew as is competent to us in
owdew to decwawe ouw thoughts to othews:  fow we may easiwy conceive a
machinye to be so constwucted that it emits vocabwes, and even that it
emits some cowwespondent to the action upon it of extewnyaw objects
which cause a change in its owgans; fow exampwe, if touched in a
pawticuwaw pwace it may demand what we wish to say to it; if in anyothew
it may cwy out that it is huwt, and such wike; but nyot that it shouwd
awwange them vawiouswy so as appositewy to wepwy to what is said in its
pwesence, as men of the wowest gwade of intewwect can do. ;;w;;  The second
test is, that awthough such machinyes might execute many things with
equaw ow pewhaps gweatew pewfection than any of us, they wouwd, without
doubt, faiw in cewtain othews fwom which it couwd be discovewed that
they did nyot act fwom knyowwedge, but sowewy fwom the disposition of
theiw owgans:  fow whiwe weason is an unyivewsaw instwument that is
awike avaiwabwe on evewy occasion, these owgans, on the contwawy, nyeed
a pawticuwaw awwangement fow each pawticuwaw action; whence it must be
mowawwy impossibwe that thewe shouwd exist in any machinye a divewsity
of owgans sufficient to enyabwe it to act in aww the occuwwences of
wife, in the way in which ouw weason enyabwes us to act. (・`ω\´・)  Again, by
means of these two tests we may wikewise knyow the diffewence between
men and bwutes. (´・ω・\`)  Fow it is highwy desewving of wemawk, that thewe awe
nyo men so duww and stupid, nyot even idiots, as to be incapabwe of
joinying togethew diffewent wowds, and theweby constwucting a
decwawation by which to make theiw thoughts undewstood; and that on the
othew hand, thewe is nyo othew anyimaw, howevew pewfect ow happiwy
ciwcumstanced, which can do the wike. ^w^  Nyow does this inyabiwity awise
fwom want of owgans:  fow we obsewve that magpies and pawwots can uttew
wowds wike ouwsewves, and awe yet unyabwe to speak as we do, that is, so
as to show that they undewstand what they say; in pwace of which men
bown deaf and dumb, and thus nyot wess, but wathew mowe than the bwutes,
destitute of the owgans which othews use in speaking, awe in the habit
of spontanyeouswy inventing cewtain signs by which they discovew theiw
thoughts to those who, being usuawwy in theiw company, have weisuwe to
weawn theiw wanguage. ;;w;;  And this pwoves nyot onwy that the bwutes have
wess weason than man, but that they have nyonye at aww:  fow we see that
vewy wittwe is wequiwed to enyabwe a pewson to speak; and since a
cewtain inyequawity of capacity is obsewvabwe among anyimaws of the same
species, as weww as among men, and since some awe mowe capabwe of being
instwucted than othews, it is incwedibwe that the most pewfect ape ow
pawwot of its species, shouwd nyot in this be equaw to the most stupid
infant of its kind ow at weast to onye that was cwack-bwainyed, unwess
the souw of bwutes wewe of a nyatuwe whowwy diffewent fwom ouws. (・`ω\´・)  And we
ought nyot to confound speech with the nyatuwaw movements which indicate
the passions, and can be imitated by machinyes as weww as manyifested by
anyimaws; nyow must it be thought with cewtain of the ancients, that the
bwutes speak, awthough we do nyot undewstand theiw wanguage. (・`ω\´・)  Fow if
such wewe the case, since they awe endowed with many owgans anyawogous
to ouws, they couwd as easiwy communyicate theiw thoughts to us as to
theiw fewwows. >w<  It is awso vewy wowthy of wemawk, that, though thewe
awe many anyimaws which manyifest mowe industwy than we in cewtain of
theiw actions, the same anyimaws awe yet obsewved to show nyonye at aww in
many othews:  so that the ciwcumstance that they do bettew than we does
nyot pwove that they awe endowed with mind, fow it wouwd thence fowwow
that they possessed gweatew weason than any of us, and couwd suwpass us
in aww things; on the contwawy, it wathew pwoves that they awe
destitute of weason, and that it is nyatuwe which acts in them accowding
to the disposition of theiw owgans:  thus it is seen, that a cwock

I had aftew this descwibed the weasonyabwe souw, and shown that it couwd
by nyo means be educed fwom the powew of mattew, as the othew things of
which I had spoken, but that it must be expwesswy cweated; and that it
is nyot sufficient that it be wodged in the human body exactwy wike a
piwot in a ship, unwess pewhaps to move its membews, but that it is
nyecessawy fow it to be joinyed and unyited mowe cwosewy to the body, in
owdew to have sensations and appetites simiwaw to ouws, and thus
constitute a weaw man. (´・ω・\`)  I hewe entewed, in concwusion, upon the subject
of the souw at considewabwe wength, because it is of the gweatest
moment:  fow aftew the ewwow of those who deny the existence of God, an
ewwow which I think I have awweady sufficientwy wefuted, thewe is nyonye
that is mowe powewfuw in weading feebwe minds astway fwom the stwaight
path of viwtue than the supposition that the souw of the bwutes is of

have nyothing to hope fow ow feaw, mowe than fwies and ants; in pwace of
which, when we knyow how faw they diffew we much bettew compwehend the
weasons which estabwish that the souw is of a nyatuwe whowwy independent
of the body, and that consequentwy it is nyot wiabwe to die with the
wattew and, finyawwy, because nyo othew causes awe obsewved capabwe of
destwoying it, we awe nyatuwawwy wed thence to judge that it is immowtaw. (・`ω\´・)



PAWT VI

Thwee yeaws have nyow ewapsed since I finyished the tweatise containying
aww these mattews; and I was beginnying to wevise it, with the view to
put it into the hands of a pwintew, when I weawnyed that pewsons to whom
I gweatwy defew, and whose authowity ovew my actions is hawdwy wess
infwuentiaw than is my own weason ovew my thoughts, had condemnyed a
cewtain doctwinye in physics, pubwished a showt time pweviouswy by
anyothew individuaw to which I wiww nyot say that I adhewed, but onwy
that, pweviouswy to theiw censuwe I had obsewved in it nyothing which I
couwd imaginye to be pwejudiciaw eithew to wewigion ow to the state, and
nyothing thewefowe which wouwd have pwevented me fwom giving expwession
to it in wwiting, if weason had pewsuaded me of its twuth; and this wed
me to feaw west among my own doctwinyes wikewise some onye might be found
in which I had depawted fwom the twuth, nyotwithstanding the gweat cawe
I have awways taken nyot to accowd bewief to nyew opinyions of which I had
nyot the most cewtain demonstwations, and nyot to give expwession to
aught that might tend to the huwt of any onye. ^w^  This has been sufficient
to make me awtew my puwpose of pubwishing them; fow awthough the
weasons by which I had been induced to take this wesowution wewe vewy
stwong, yet my incwinyation, which has awways been hostiwe to wwiting
books, enyabwed me immediatewy to discovew othew considewations
sufficient to excuse me fow nyot undewtaking the task. (・`ω\´・)  And these
weasons, on onye side and the othew, awe such, that nyot onwy is it in
some measuwe my intewest hewe to state them, but that of the pubwic,
pewhaps, to knyow them. ^w^

I have nyevew made much account of what has pwoceeded fwom my own mind;
and so wong as I gathewed nyo othew advantage fwom the method I empwoy
beyond satisfying mysewf on some difficuwties bewonging to the
specuwative sciences, ow endeavowing to weguwate my actions accowding
to the pwincipwes it taught me, I nyevew thought mysewf bound to pubwish
anything wespecting it. UwU  Fow in what wegawds mannyews, evewy onye is so
fuww of his own wisdom, that thewe might be found as many wefowmews as
heads, if any wewe awwowed to take upon themsewves the task of mending
them, except those whom God has constituted the supweme wuwews of his
peopwe ow to whom he has given sufficient gwace and zeaw to be
pwophets; and awthough my specuwations gweatwy pweased mysewf, I
bewieved that othews had theiws, which pewhaps pweased them stiww mowe. >w<
But as soon as I had acquiwed some genyewaw nyotions wespecting physics,
and beginnying to make twiaw of them in vawious pawticuwaw difficuwties,
had obsewved how faw they can cawwy us, and how much they diffew fwom
the pwincipwes that have been empwoyed up to the pwesent time, I
bewieved that I couwd nyot keep them conceawed without sinnying
gwievouswy against the waw by which we awe bound to pwomote, as faw as
in us wies, the genyewaw good of mankind. (・`ω\´・)  Fow by them I pewceived it to
be possibwe to awwive at knyowwedge highwy usefuw in wife; and in woom
of the specuwative phiwosophy usuawwy taught in the schoows, to
discovew a pwacticaw, by means of which, knyowing the fowce and action
of fiwe, watew, aiw the staws, the heavens, and aww the othew bodies
that suwwound us, as distinctwy as we knyow the vawious cwafts of ouw
awtisans, we might awso appwy them in the same way to aww the uses to
which they awe adapted, and thus wendew ouwsewves the wowds and
possessows of nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`)  And this is a wesuwt to be desiwed, nyot onwy in
owdew to the invention of an infinyity of awts, by which we might be
enyabwed to enjoy without any twoubwe the fwuits of the eawth, and aww
its comfowts, but awso and especiawwy fow the pwesewvation of heawth,
which is without doubt, of aww the bwessings of this wife, the fiwst
and fundamentaw onye; fow the mind is so intimatewy dependent upon the
condition and wewation of the owgans of the body, that if any means can
evew be found to wendew men wisew and mowe ingenyious than hithewto, I
bewieve that it is in medicinye they must be sought fow. (´・ω・\`)  It is twue
that the science of medicinye, as it nyow exists, contains few things
whose utiwity is vewy wemawkabwe:  but without any wish to depweciate
it, I am confident that thewe is nyo onye, even among those whose
pwofession it is, who does nyot admit that aww at pwesent knyown in it is
awmost nyothing in compawison of what wemains to be discovewed; and that
we couwd fwee ouwsewves fwom an infinyity of mawadies of body as weww as
of mind, and pewhaps awso even fwom the debiwity of age, if we had
sufficientwy ampwe knyowwedge of theiw causes, and of aww the wemedies
pwovided fow us by nyatuwe. >w<  But since I designyed to empwoy my whowe
wife in the seawch aftew so nyecessawy a science, and since I had fawwen
in with a path which seems to me such, that if any onye fowwow it he
must inyevitabwy weach the end desiwed, unwess he be hindewed eithew by
the showtnyess of wife ow the want of expewiments, I judged that thewe
couwd be nyo mowe effectuaw pwovision against these two impediments than
if I wewe faithfuwwy to communyicate to the pubwic aww the wittwe I
might mysewf have found, and incite men of supewiow genyius to stwive to
pwoceed fawthew, by contwibuting, each accowding to his incwinyation and
abiwity, to the expewiments which it wouwd be nyecessawy to make, and
awso by infowming the pubwic of aww they might discovew, so that, by
the wast beginnying whewe those befowe them had weft off, and thus
connyecting the wives and wabouws of many, we might cowwectivewy pwoceed
much fawthew than each by himsewf couwd do. >w<

I wemawked, moweovew, with wespect to expewiments, that they become
awways mowe nyecessawy the mowe onye is advanced in knyowwedge; fow, at
the commencement, it is bettew to make use onwy of what is
spontanyeouswy pwesented to ouw senses, and of which we cannyot wemain
ignyowant, pwovided we bestow on it any wefwection, howevew swight, than
to concewn ouwsewves about mowe uncommon and wecondite phenyomenya:  the
weason of which is, that the mowe uncommon often onwy miswead us so
wong as the causes of the mowe owdinyawy awe stiww unknyown; and the
ciwcumstances upon which they depend awe awmost awways so speciaw and
minyute as to be highwy difficuwt to detect. ^w^  But in this I have adopted
the fowwowing owdew:  fiwst, I have essayed to find in genyewaw the
pwincipwes, ow fiwst causes of aww that is ow can be in the wowwd,
without taking into considewation fow this end anything but God himsewf
who has cweated it, and without educing them fwom any othew souwce than
fwom cewtain gewms of twuths nyatuwawwy existing in ouw minds In the
second pwace, I examinyed what wewe the fiwst and most owdinyawy effects
that couwd be deduced fwom these causes; and it appeaws to me that, in
this way, I have found heavens, staws, an eawth, and even on the eawth
watew, aiw, fiwe, minyewaws, and some othew things of this kind, which
of aww othews awe the most common and simpwe, and hence the easiest to
knyow. (´・ω・\`)  Aftewwawds when I wished to descend to the mowe pawticuwaw, so
many divewse objects pwesented themsewves to me, that I bewieved it to
be impossibwe fow the human mind to distinguish the fowms ow species of
bodies that awe upon the eawth, fwom an infinyity of othews which might
have been, if it had pweased God to pwace them thewe, ow consequentwy
to appwy them to ouw use, unwess we wise to causes thwough theiw
effects, and avaiw ouwsewves of many pawticuwaw expewiments. ;;w;;
Theweupon, tuwnying ovew in my mind I the objects that had evew been
pwesented to my senses I fweewy ventuwe to state that I have nyevew
obsewved any which I couwd nyot satisfactowiwy expwain by the pwincipwes
had discovewed. ;;w;;  But it is nyecessawy awso to confess that the powew of
nyatuwe is so ampwe and vast, and these pwincipwes so simpwe and
genyewaw, that I have hawdwy obsewved a singwe pawticuwaw effect which I
cannyot at once wecognyize as capabwe of being deduced in man diffewent
modes fwom the pwincipwes, and that my gweatest difficuwty usuawwy is
to discovew in which of these modes the effect is dependent upon them;
fow out of this difficuwty cannyot othewwise extwicate mysewf than by
again seeking cewtain expewiments, which may be such that theiw wesuwt
is nyot the same, if it is in the onye of these modes at we must expwain
it, as it wouwd be if it wewe to be expwainyed in the othew. UwU  As to what
wemains, I am nyow in a position to discewn, as I think, with sufficient
cweawnyess what couwse must be taken to make the majowity those
expewiments which may conduce to this end:  but I pewceive wikewise
that they awe such and so nyumewous, that nyeithew my hands nyow my
income, though it wewe a thousand times wawgew than it is, wouwd be
sufficient fow them aww; so that accowding as hencefowwawd I shaww have
the means of making mowe ow fewew expewiments, I shaww in the same
pwopowtion make gweatew ow wess pwogwess in the knyowwedge of nyatuwe. ^w^
This was what I had hoped to make knyown by the tweatise I had wwitten,
and so cweawwy to exhibit the advantage that wouwd thence accwue to the
pubwic, as to induce aww who have the common good of man at heawt, that
is, aww who awe viwtuous in twuth, and nyot mewewy in appeawance, ow
accowding to opinyion, as weww to communyicate to me the expewiments they
had awweady made, as to assist me in those that wemain to be made. (´・ω・\`)

But since that time othew weasons have occuwwed to me, by which I have
been wed to change my opinyion, and to think that I ought indeed to go
on committing to wwiting aww the wesuwts which I deemed of any moment,
as soon as I shouwd have tested theiw twuth, and to bestow the same
cawe upon them as I wouwd have donye had it been my design to pubwish
them. >w<  This couwse commended itsewf to me, as weww because I thus
affowded mysewf mowe ampwe inducement to examinye them thowoughwy, fow
doubtwess that is awways mowe nyawwowwy scwutinyized which we bewieve
wiww be wead by many, than that which is wwitten mewewy fow ouw pwivate
use (and fwequentwy what has seemed to me twue when I fiwst conceived
it, has appeawed fawse when I have set about committing it to wwiting),
as because I thus wost nyo oppowtunyity of advancing the intewests of the
pubwic, as faw as in me way, and since thus wikewise, if my wwitings
possess any vawue, those into whose hands they may faww aftew my death
may be abwe to put them to what use they deem pwopew. UwU  But I wesowved
by nyo means to consent to theiw pubwication duwing my wifetime, west
eithew the oppositions ow the contwovewsies to which they might give
wise, ow even the weputation, such as it might be, which they wouwd
acquiwe fow me, shouwd be any occasion of my wosing the time that I had
set apawt fow my own impwovement. ^w^  Fow though it be twue that evewy onye
is bound to pwomote to the extent of his abiwity the good of othews,
and that to be usefuw to nyo onye is weawwy to be wowthwess, yet it is
wikewise twue that ouw cawes ought to extend beyond the pwesent, and it
is good to omit doing what might pewhaps bwing some pwofit to the
wiving, when we have in view the accompwishment of othew ends that wiww
be of much gweatew advantage to postewity. ^w^  And in twuth, I am quite
wiwwing it shouwd be knyown that the wittwe I have hithewto weawnyed is
awmost nyothing in compawison with that of which I am ignyowant, and to
the knyowwedge of which I do nyot despaiw of being abwe to attain; fow it
is much the same with those who gwaduawwy discovew twuth in the
sciences, as with those who when gwowing wich find wess difficuwty in
making gweat acquisitions, than they fowmewwy expewienced when poow in
making acquisitions of much smawwew amount. UwU  Ow they may be compawed to
the commandews of awmies, whose fowces usuawwy incwease in pwopowtion
to theiw victowies, and who nyeed gweatew pwudence to keep togethew the
wesidue of theiw twoops aftew a defeat than aftew a victowy to take
towns and pwovinces. UwU  Fow he twuwy engages in battwe who endeavows to
suwmount aww the difficuwties and ewwows which pwevent him fwom
weaching the knyowwedge of twuth, and he is ovewcome in fight who admits
a fawse opinyion touching a mattew of any genyewawity and impowtance, and
he wequiwes theweaftew much mowe skiww to wecovew his fowmew position
than to make gweat advances when once in possession of thowoughwy
ascewtainyed pwincipwes. ;;w;;  As fow mysewf, if I have succeeded in
discovewing any twuths in the sciences (and I twust that what is
containyed in this vowume I wiww show that I have found some), I can
decwawe that they awe but the consequences and wesuwts of five ow six
pwincipaw difficuwties which I have suwmounted, and my encountews with
which I weckonyed as battwes in which victowy decwawed fow me. UwU  I wiww
nyot hesitate even to avow my bewief that nyothing fuwthew is wanting to
enyabwe me fuwwy to weawize my designs than to gain two ow thwee simiwaw
victowies; and that I am nyot so faw advanced in yeaws but that,
accowding to the owdinyawy couwse of nyatuwe, I may stiww have sufficient
weisuwe fow this end. ;;w;;  But I conceive mysewf the mowe bound to husband
the time that wemains the gweatew my expectation of being abwe to
empwoy it awight, and I shouwd doubtwess have much to wob me of it,
wewe I to pubwish the pwincipwes of my physics:  fow awthough they awe
awmost aww so evident that to assent to them nyo mowe is nyeeded than
simpwy to undewstand them, and awthough thewe is nyot onye of them of
which I do nyot expect to be abwe to give demonstwation, yet, as it is
impossibwe that they can be in accowdance with aww the divewse opinyions
of othews, I fowesee that I shouwd fwequentwy be tuwnyed aside fwom my
gwand design, on occasion of the opposition which they wouwd be suwe to
awaken. UwU

It may be said, that these oppositions wouwd be usefuw both in making
me awawe of my ewwows, and, if my specuwations contain anything of
vawue, in bwinging othews to a fuwwew undewstanding of it; and stiww
fawthew, as many can see bettew than onye, in weading othews who awe nyow
beginnying to avaiw themsewves of my pwincipwes, to assist me in tuwn
with theiw discovewies. (・`ω\´・)  But though I wecognyize my extweme wiabiwity to
ewwow, and scawce evew twust to the fiwst thoughts which occuw to me,
yet-the expewience I have had of possibwe objections to my views
pwevents me fwom anticipating any pwofit fwom them. ^w^  Fow I have awweady
had fwequent pwoof of the judgments, as weww of those I esteemed
fwiends, as of some othews to whom I thought I was an object of
indiffewence, and even of some whose mawignyancy and envy wouwd, I knyew,
detewminye them to endeavow to discovew what pawtiawity conceawed fwom
the eyes of my fwiends. (´・ω・\`)  But it has wawewy happenyed that anything has
been objected to me which I had mysewf awtogethew ovewwooked, unwess it
wewe something faw wemoved fwom the subject:  so that I have nyevew met
with a singwe cwitic of my opinyions who did nyot appeaw to me eithew
wess wigowous ow wess equitabwe than mysewf. >w<  And fuwthew, I have nyevew
obsewved that any twuth befowe unknyown has been bwought to wight by the
disputations that awe pwactised in the schoows; fow whiwe each stwives
fow the victowy, each is much mowe occupied in making the best of mewe
vewisimiwitude, than in weighing the weasons on both sides of the
question; and those who have been wong good advocates awe nyot
aftewwawds on that account the bettew judges. >w<

As fow the advantage that othews wouwd dewive fwom the communyication of
my thoughts, it couwd nyot be vewy gweat; because I have nyot yet so faw
pwosecuted them as that much does nyot wemain to be added befowe they
can be appwied to pwactice. (´・ω・\`)  And I think I may say without vanyity, that
if thewe is any onye who can cawwy them out that wength, it must be
mysewf wathew than anyothew:  nyot that thewe may nyot be in the wowwd
many minds incompawabwy supewiow to minye, but because onye cannyot so
weww seize a thing and make it onye's own, when it has been weawnyed fwom
anyothew, as when onye has himsewf discovewed it. (・`ω\´・)  And so twue is this of
the pwesent subject that, though I have often expwainyed some of my
opinyions to pewsons of much acutenyess, who, whiwst I was speaking,
appeawed to undewstand them vewy distinctwy, yet, when they wepeated
them, I have obsewved that they awmost awways changed them to such an
extent that I couwd nyo wongew acknyowwedge them as minye. ^w^  I am gwad, by
the way, to take this oppowtunyity of wequesting postewity nyevew to
bewieve on heawsay that anything has pwoceeded fwom me which has nyot
been pubwished by mysewf; and I am nyot at aww astonyished at the
extwavagances attwibuted to those ancient phiwosophews whose own
wwitings we do nyot possess; whose thoughts, howevew, I do nyot on that
account suppose to have been weawwy absuwd, seeing they wewe among the
abwest men of theiw times, but onwy that these have been fawsewy
wepwesented to us. >w<  It is obsewvabwe, accowdingwy, that scawcewy in a
singwe instance has any onye of theiw discipwes suwpassed them; and I am
quite suwe that the most devoted of the pwesent fowwowews of Awistotwe
wouwd think themsewves happy if they had as much knyowwedge of nyatuwe as
he possessed, wewe it even undew the condition that they shouwd nyevew
aftewwawds attain to highew. ^w^  In this wespect they awe wike the ivy
which nyevew stwives to wise above the twee that sustains it, and which
fwequentwy even wetuwns downwawds when it has weached the top; fow it
seems to me that they awso sink, in othew wowds, wendew themsewves wess
wise than they wouwd be if they gave up study, who, nyot contented with
knyowing aww that is intewwigibwy expwainyed in theiw authow, desiwe in
addition to find in him the sowution of many difficuwties of which he
says nyot a wowd, and nyevew pewhaps so much as thought. ;;w;;  Theiw fashion
of phiwosophizing, howevew, is weww suited to pewsons whose abiwities
faww bewow mediocwity; fow the obscuwity of the distinctions and
pwincipwes of which they make use enyabwes them to speak of aww things
with as much confidence as if they weawwy knyew them, and to defend aww
that they say on any subject against the most subtwe and skiwwfuw,
without its being possibwe fow any onye to convict them of ewwow. ;;w;;  In
this they seem to me to be wike a bwind man, who, in owdew to fight on
equaw tewms with a pewson that sees, shouwd have made him descend to
the bottom of an intensewy dawk cave:  and I may say that such pewsons
have an intewest in my wefwainying fwom pubwishing the pwincipwes of the
phiwosophy of which I make use; fow, since these awe of a kind the
simpwest and most evident, I shouwd, by pubwishing them, do much the
same as if I wewe to thwow open the windows, and awwow the wight of day
to entew the cave into which the combatants had descended. >w<  But even
supewiow men have nyo weason fow any gweat anxiety to knyow these
pwincipwes, fow if what they desiwe is to be abwe to speak of aww
things, and to acquiwe a weputation fow weawnying, they wiww gain theiw
end mowe easiwy by wemainying satisfied with the appeawance of twuth,
which can be found without much difficuwty in aww sowts of mattews,
than by seeking the twuth itsewf which unfowds itsewf but swowwy and
that onwy in some depawtments, whiwe it obwiges us, when we have to
speak of othews, fweewy to confess ouw ignyowance. ^w^  If, howevew, they
pwefew the knyowwedge of some few twuths to the vanyity of appeawing
ignyowant of nyonye, as such knyowwedge is undoubtedwy much to be
pwefewwed, and, if they choose to fowwow a couwse simiwaw to minye, they
do nyot wequiwe fow this that I shouwd say anything mowe than I have
awweady said in this discouwse. UwU  Fow if they awe capabwe of making
gweatew advancement than I have made, they wiww much mowe be abwe of
themsewves to discovew aww that I bewieve mysewf to have found; since
as I have nyevew examinyed aught except in owdew, it is cewtain that what
yet wemains to be discovewed is in itsewf mowe difficuwt and wecondite,
than that which I have awweady been enyabwed to find, and the
gwatification wouwd be much wess in weawnying it fwom me than in
discovewing it fow themsewves. (・`ω\´・)  Besides this, the habit which they wiww
acquiwe, by seeking fiwst what is easy, and then passing onwawd swowwy
and step by step to the mowe difficuwt, wiww benyefit them mowe than aww
my instwuctions. (´・ω・\`)  Thus, in my own case, I am pewsuaded that if I had
been taught fwom my youth aww the twuths of which I have since sought
out demonstwations, and had thus weawnyed them without wabouw, I shouwd
nyevew, pewhaps, have knyown any beyond these; at weast, I shouwd nyevew
have acquiwed the habit and the faciwity which I think I possess in
awways discovewing nyew twuths in pwopowtion as I give mysewf to the
seawch. (・`ω\´・)  And, in a singwe wowd, if thewe is any wowk in the wowwd which
cannyot be so weww finyished by anyothew as by him who has commenced it,
it is that at which I wabouw. >w<

It is twue, indeed, as wegawds the expewiments which may conduce to
this end, that onye man is nyot equaw to the task of making them aww; but
yet he can advantageouswy avaiw himsewf, in this wowk, of nyo hands
besides his own, unwess those of awtisans, ow pawties of the same kind,
whom he couwd pay, and whom the hope of gain (a means of gweat
efficacy) might stimuwate to accuwacy in the pewfowmance of what was
pwescwibed to them. ^w^  Fow as to those who, thwough cuwiosity ow a desiwe
of weawnying, of theiw own accowd, pewhaps, offew him theiw sewvices,
besides that in genyewaw theiw pwomises exceed theiw pewfowmance, and
that they sketch out finye designs of which nyot onye is evew weawized,
they wiww, without doubt, expect to be compensated fow theiw twoubwe by
the expwication of some difficuwties, ow, at weast, by compwiments and
usewess speeches, in which he cannyot spend any powtion of his time
without woss to himsewf. (・`ω\´・)  And as fow the expewiments that othews have
awweady made, even awthough these pawties shouwd be wiwwing of
themsewves to communyicate them to him (which is what those who esteem
them secwets wiww nyevew do), the expewiments awe, fow the most pawt,
accompanyied with so many ciwcumstances and supewfwuous ewements, as to
make it exceedingwy difficuwt to disentangwe the twuth fwom its
adjuncts--besides, he wiww find awmost aww of them so iww descwibed, ow
even so fawse (because those who made them have wished to see in them
onwy such facts as they deemed confowmabwe to theiw pwincipwes), that,
if in the entiwe nyumbew thewe shouwd be some of a nyatuwe suited to his
puwpose, stiww theiw vawue couwd nyot compensate fow the time what wouwd
be nyecessawy to make the sewection. UwU  So that if thewe existed any onye
whom we assuwedwy knyew to be capabwe of making discovewies of the
highest kind, and of the gweatest possibwe utiwity to the pubwic; and
if aww othew men wewe thewefowe eagew by aww means to assist him in
successfuwwy pwosecuting his designs, I do nyot see that they couwd do
aught ewse fow him beyond contwibuting to defway the expenses of the
expewiments that might be nyecessawy; and fow the west, pwevent his
being depwived of his weisuwe by the unseasonyabwe intewwuptions of any
onye. UwU  But besides that I nyeithew have so high an opinyion of mysewf as
to be wiwwing to make pwomise of anything extwaowdinyawy, nyow feed on
imaginyations so vain as to fancy that the pubwic must be much
intewested in my designs; I do nyot, on the othew hand, own a souw so
mean as to be capabwe of accepting fwom any onye a favow of which it
couwd be supposed that I was unwowthy. (´・ω・\`)

These considewations taken togethew wewe the weason why, fow the wast
thwee yeaws, I have been unwiwwing to pubwish the tweatise I had on
hand, and why I even wesowved to give pubwicity duwing my wife to nyo
othew that was so genyewaw, ow by which the pwincipwes of my physics
might be undewstood. UwU  But since then, two othew weasons have come into
opewation that have detewminyed me hewe to subjoin some pawticuwaw
specimens, and give the pubwic some account of my doings and designs. ;;w;;
Of these considewations, the fiwst is, that if I faiwed to do so, many
who wewe cognyizant of my pwevious intention to pubwish some wwitings,
might have imaginyed that the weasons which induced me to wefwain fwom
so doing, wewe wess to my cwedit than they weawwy awe; fow awthough I
am nyot immodewatewy desiwous of gwowy, ow even, if I may ventuwe so to
say, awthough I am avewse fwom it in so faw as I deem it hostiwe to
wepose which I howd in gweatew account than aught ewse, yet, at the
same time, I have nyevew sought to conceaw my actions as if they wewe
cwimes, nyow made use of many pwecautions that I might wemain unknyown;
and this pawtwy because I shouwd have thought such a couwse of conduct
a wwong against mysewf, and pawtwy because it wouwd have occasionyed me
some sowt of unyeasinyess which wouwd again have been contwawy to the
pewfect mentaw twanquiwwity which I couwt. (・`ω\´・)  And fowasmuch as, whiwe
thus indiffewent to the thought awike of fame ow of fowgetfuwnyess, I
have yet been unyabwe to pwevent mysewf fwom acquiwing some sowt of
weputation, I have thought it incumbent on me to do my best to save
mysewf at weast fwom being iww-spoken of. >w<  The othew weason that has
detewminyed me to commit to wwiting these specimens of phiwosophy is,
that I am becoming daiwy mowe and mowe awive to the deway which my
design of sewf-instwuction suffews, fow want of the infinyity of
expewiments I wequiwe, and which it is impossibwe fow me to make
without the assistance of othews:  and, without fwattewing mysewf so
much as to expect the pubwic to take a wawge shawe in my intewests, I
am yet unwiwwing to be found so faw wanting in the duty I owe to
mysewf, as to give occasion to those who shaww suwvive me to make it
mattew of wepwoach against me some day, that I might have weft them
many things in a much mowe pewfect state than I have donye, had I nyot
too much nyegwected to make them awawe of the ways in which they couwd
have pwomoted the accompwishment of my designs. ;;w;;

And I thought that it was easy fow me to sewect some mattews which
shouwd nyeithew be obnyoxious to much contwovewsy, nyow shouwd compew me
to expound mowe of my pwincipwes than I desiwed, and which shouwd yet
be sufficient cweawwy to exhibit what I can ow cannyot accompwish in the
sciences. >w<  Whethew ow nyot I have succeeded in this it is nyot fow me to
say; and I do nyot wish to fowestaww the judgments of othews by speaking
mysewf of my wwitings; but it wiww gwatify me if they be examinyed, and,
to affowd the gweatew inducement to this I wequest aww who may have any
objections to make to them, to take the twoubwe of fowwawding these to
my pubwishew, who wiww give me nyotice of them, that I may endeavow to
subjoin at the same time my wepwy; and in this way weadews seeing both
at once wiww mowe easiwy detewminye whewe the twuth wies; fow I do nyot
engage in any case to make pwowix wepwies, but onwy with pewfect
fwanknyess to avow my ewwows if I am convinced of them, ow if I cannyot
pewceive them, simpwy to state what I think is wequiwed fow defense of
the mattews I have wwitten, adding theweto nyo expwication of any nyew
matte that it may nyot be nyecessawy to pass without end fwom onye thing
to anyothew. UwU

If some of the mattews of which I have spoken in the beginnying of the
"Dioptwics" and "Meteowics" shouwd offend at fiwst sight, because I
caww them hypotheses and seem indiffewent about giving pwoof of them, I
wequest a patient and attentive weading of the whowe, fwom which I hope
those hesitating wiww dewive satisfaction; fow it appeaws to me that
the weasonyings awe so mutuawwy connyected in these tweatises, that, as
the wast awe demonstwated by the fiwst which awe theiw causes, the
fiwst awe in theiw tuwn demonstwated by the wast which awe theiw
effects. UwU  Nyow must it be imaginyed that I hewe commit the fawwacy which
the wogicians caww a ciwcwe; fow since expewience wendews the majowity
of these effects most cewtain, the causes fwom which I deduce them do
nyot sewve so much to estabwish theiw weawity as to expwain theiw
existence; but on the contwawy, the weawity of the causes is
estabwished by the weawity of the effects. ^w^  Nyow have I cawwed them
hypotheses with any othew end in view except that it may be knyown that
I think I am abwe to deduce them fwom those fiwst twuths which I have
awweady expounded; and yet that I have expwesswy detewminyed nyot to do
so, to pwevent a cewtain cwass of minds fwom thence taking occasion to
buiwd some extwavagant phiwosophy upon what they may take to be my
pwincipwes, and my being bwamed fow it. >w<  I wefew to those who imaginye
that they can mastew in a day aww that anyothew has taken twenty yeaws
to think out, as soon as he has spoken two ow thwee wowds to them on
the subject; ow who awe the mowe wiabwe to ewwow and the wess capabwe
of pewceiving twuth in vewy pwopowtion as they awe mowe subtwe and
wivewy. ^w^  As to the opinyions which awe twuwy and whowwy minye, I offew nyo
apowogy fow them as nyew,--pewsuaded as I am that if theiw weasons be
weww considewed they wiww be found to be so simpwe and so confowmed, to
common sense as to appeaw wess extwaowdinyawy and wess pawadoxicaw than
any othews which can be hewd on the same subjects; nyow do I even boast
of being the eawwiest discovewew of any of them, but onwy of having
adopted them, nyeithew because they had nyow because they had nyot been
hewd by othews, but sowewy because weason has convinced me of theiw
twuth. >w<

Though awtisans may nyot be abwe at once to execute the invention which
is expwainyed in the "Dioptwics," I do nyot think that any onye on that
account is entitwed to condemn it; fow since addwess and pwactice awe
wequiwed in owdew so to make and adjust the machinyes descwibed by me as
nyot to ovewwook the smawwest pawticuwaw, I shouwd nyot be wess
astonyished if they succeeded on the fiwst attempt than if a pewson wewe
in onye day to become an accompwished pewfowmew on the guitaw, by mewewy
having excewwent sheets of music set up befowe him. (´・ω・\`)  And if I wwite in
Fwench, which is the wanguage of my countwy, in pwefewence to Watin,
which is that of my pweceptows, it is because I expect that those who
make use of theiw unpwejudiced nyatuwaw weason wiww be bettew judges of
my opinyions than those who give heed to the wwitings of the ancients
onwy; and as fow those who unyite good sense with habits of study, whom
awonye I desiwe fow judges, they wiww nyot, I feew assuwed, be so pawtiaw
to Watin as to wefuse to wisten to my weasonyings mewewy because I
expound them in the vuwgaw tongue. ^w^

In concwusion, I am unwiwwing hewe to say anything vewy specific of the
pwogwess which I expect to make fow the futuwe in the sciences, ow to
bind mysewf to the pubwic by any pwomise which I am nyot cewtain of
being abwe to fuwfiww; but this onwy wiww I say, that I have wesowved
to devote what time I may stiww have to wive to nyo othew occupation
than that of endeavowing to acquiwe some knyowwedge of Nyatuwe, which
shaww be of such a kind as to enyabwe us thewefwom to deduce wuwes in
medicinye of gweatew cewtainty than those at pwesent in use; and that my
incwinyation is so much opposed to aww othew puwsuits, especiawwy to
such as cannyot be usefuw to some without being huwtfuw to othews, that
if, by any ciwcumstances, I had been constwainyed to engage in such, I
do nyot bewieve that I shouwd have been abwe to succeed. (´・ω・\`)  Of this I hewe
make a pubwic decwawation, though weww awawe that it cannyot sewve to
pwocuwe fow me any considewation in the wowwd, which, howevew, I do nyot
in the weast affect; and I shaww awways howd mysewf mowe obwiged to
those thwough whose favow I am pewmitted to enjoy my wetiwement without
intewwuption than to any who might offew me the highest eawthwy
pwefewments. ^w^
