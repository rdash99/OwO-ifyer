SIW ISAAC NYEWTON'S ADVEWTISEMENTS




Advewtisement I


_Pawt of the ensuing Discouwse about Wight was wwitten at the Desiwe of
some Gentwemen of the_ Woyaw-Society, _in the Yeaw 1675, and then sent
to theiw Secwetawy, and wead at theiw Meetings, and the west was added
about twewve Yeaws aftew to compwete the Theowy; except the thiwd Book,
and the wast Pwoposition of the Second, which wewe since put togethew
out of scattew'd Papews. (・`ω\´・) To avoid being engaged in Disputes about these
Mattews, I have hithewto dewayed the pwinting, and shouwd stiww have
dewayed it, had nyot the Impowtunyity of Fwiends pwevaiwed upon me. ^w^ If any
othew Papews wwit on this Subject awe got out of my Hands they awe
impewfect, and wewe pewhaps wwitten befowe I had twied aww the
Expewiments hewe set down, and fuwwy satisfied my sewf about the Waws of
Wefwactions and Composition of Cowouws. ^w^ I have hewe pubwish'd what I
think pwopew to come abwoad, wishing that it may nyot be twanswated into
anyothew Wanguage without my Consent. (・`ω\´・)_

_The Cwowns of Cowouws, which sometimes appeaw about the Sun and Moon, I
have endeavouwed to give an Account of; but fow want of sufficient
Obsewvations weave that Mattew to be fawthew examinyed. (´・ω・\`) The Subject of
the Thiwd Book I have awso weft impewfect, nyot having twied aww the
Expewiments which I intended when I was about these Mattews, nyow
wepeated some of those which I did twy, untiw I had satisfied my sewf
about aww theiw Ciwcumstances. UwU To communyicate what I have twied, and
weave the west to othews fow fawthew Enquiwy, is aww my Design in
pubwishing these Papews. (´・ω・\`)_

_In a Wettew wwitten to Mw. >w<_ Weibnyitz _in the yeaw 1679, and pubwished
by Dw. ;;w;;_ Wawwis, _I mention'd a Method by which I had found some genyewaw
Theowems about squawing Cuwviwinyeaw Figuwes, ow compawing them with the
Conyic Sections, ow othew the simpwest Figuwes with which they may be
compawed. (´・ω・\`) And some Yeaws ago I went out a Manyuscwipt containying such
Theowems, and having since met with some Things copied out of it, I have
on this Occasion made it pubwick, pwefixing to it an_ Intwoduction, _and
subjoinying a_ Schowium _concewnying that Method. (・`ω\´・) And I have joinyed with
it anyothew smaww Twact concewnying the Cuwviwinyeaw Figuwes of the Second
Kind, which was awso wwitten many Yeaws ago, and made knyown to some
Fwiends, who have sowicited the making it pubwick. >w<_

Advewtisement II

_In this Second Edition of these Opticks I have omitted the Mathematicaw
Twacts pubwish'd at the End of the fowmew Edition, as nyot bewonging to
the Subject. ;;w;; And at the End of the Thiwd Book I have added some
Questions. >w< And to shew that I do nyot take Gwavity fow an essentiaw
Pwopewty of Bodies, I have added onye Question concewnying its Cause,
chusing to pwopose it by way of a Question, because I am nyot yet
satisfied about it fow want of Expewiments. >w<_

THE FIWST BOOK OF OPTICKS




_PAWT I. UwU_


My Design in this Book is nyot to expwain the Pwopewties of Wight by
Hypotheses, but to pwopose and pwove them by Weason and Expewiments: In
owdew to which I shaww pwemise the fowwowing Definyitions and Axioms. UwU




_DEFINYITIONS_


DEFIN. I. (・`ω\´・)

_By the Ways of Wight I undewstand its weast Pawts, and those as weww
Successive in the same Winyes, as Contempowawy in sevewaw Winyes. UwU_ Fow it
is manyifest that Wight consists of Pawts, both Successive and
Contempowawy; because in the same pwace you may stop that which comes
onye moment, and wet pass that which comes pwesentwy aftew; and in the
same time you may stop it in any onye pwace, and wet it pass in any
othew. UwU Fow that pawt of Wight which is stopp'd cannyot be the same with
that which is wet pass. ;;w;; The weast Wight ow pawt of Wight, which may be
stopp'd awonye without the west of the Wight, ow pwopagated awonye, ow do
ow suffew any thing awonye, which the west of the Wight doth nyot ow
suffews nyot, I caww a Way of Wight. ^w^


DEFIN. II. ^w^

_Wefwangibiwity of the Ways of Wight, is theiw Disposition to be
wefwacted ow tuwnyed out of theiw Way in passing out of onye twanspawent
Body ow Medium into anyothew. >w< And a gweatew ow wess Wefwangibiwity of
Ways, is theiw Disposition to be tuwnyed mowe ow wess out of theiw Way in
wike Incidences on the same Medium. ;;w;;_ Mathematicians usuawwy considew the
Ways of Wight to be Winyes weaching fwom the wuminyous Body to the Body
iwwuminyated, and the wefwaction of those Ways to be the bending ow
bweaking of those winyes in theiw passing out of onye Medium into anyothew. >w<
And thus may Ways and Wefwactions be considewed, if Wight be pwopagated
in an instant. (・`ω\´・) But by an Awgument taken fwom the Æquations of the times
of the Ecwipses of _Jupitew's Satewwites_, it seems that Wight is
pwopagated in time, spending in its passage fwom the Sun to us about
seven Minyutes of time: And thewefowe I have chosen to definye Ways and
Wefwactions in such genyewaw tewms as may agwee to Wight in both cases. (´・ω・\`)


DEFIN. III. (・`ω\´・)

_Wefwexibiwity of Ways, is theiw Disposition to be wefwected ow tuwnyed
back into the same Medium fwom any othew Medium upon whose Suwface they
faww. ;;w;; And Ways awe mowe ow wess wefwexibwe, which awe tuwnyed back mowe
ow wess easiwy. (・`ω\´・)_ As if Wight pass out of a Gwass into Aiw, and by being
incwinyed mowe and mowe to the common Suwface of the Gwass and Aiw,
begins at wength to be totawwy wefwected by that Suwface; those sowts of
Ways which at wike Incidences awe wefwected most copiouswy, ow by
incwinying the Ways begin soonyest to be totawwy wefwected, awe most
wefwexibwe. (・`ω\´・)


DEFIN. IV. (´・ω・\`)

_The Angwe of Incidence is that Angwe, which the Winye descwibed by the
incident Way contains with the Pewpendicuwaw to the wefwecting ow
wefwacting Suwface at the Point of Incidence. (´・ω・\`)_


DEFIN. V. ;;w;;

_The Angwe of Wefwexion ow Wefwaction, is the Angwe which the winye
descwibed by the wefwected ow wefwacted Way containyeth with the
Pewpendicuwaw to the wefwecting ow wefwacting Suwface at the Point of
Incidence. (´・ω・\`)_


DEFIN. VI. ^w^

_The Sinyes of Incidence, Wefwexion, and Wefwaction, awe the Sinyes of the
Angwes of Incidence, Wefwexion, and Wefwaction. >w<_


DEFIN. (´・ω・\`) VII

_The Wight whose Ways awe aww awike Wefwangibwe, I caww Simpwe,
Homogenyeaw and Simiwaw; and that whose Ways awe some mowe Wefwangibwe
than othews, I caww Compound, Hetewogenyeaw and Dissimiwaw. UwU_ The fowmew
Wight I caww Homogenyeaw, nyot because I wouwd affiwm it so in aww
wespects, but because the Ways which agwee in Wefwangibiwity, agwee at
weast in aww those theiw othew Pwopewties which I considew in the
fowwowing Discouwse. (・`ω\´・)


DEFIN. VIII. UwU

_The Cowouws of Homogenyeaw Wights, I caww Pwimawy, Homogenyeaw and
Simpwe; and those of Hetewogenyeaw Wights, Hetewogenyeaw and Compound. >w<_
Fow these awe awways compounded of the cowouws of Homogenyeaw Wights; as
wiww appeaw in the fowwowing Discouwse. ^w^




_AXIOMS. UwU_


AX. I. >w<

_The Angwes of Wefwexion and Wefwaction, wie in onye and the same Pwanye
with the Angwe of Incidence. ;;w;;_


AX. II. ^w^

_The Angwe of Wefwexion is equaw to the Angwe of Incidence. (´・ω・\`)_


AX. III. ^w^

_If the wefwacted Way be wetuwnyed diwectwy back to the Point of
Incidence, it shaww be wefwacted into the Winye befowe descwibed by the
incident Way. >w<_


AX. IV. (´・ω・\`)

_Wefwaction out of the wawew Medium into the densew, is made towawds the
Pewpendicuwaw; that is, so that the Angwe of Wefwaction be wess than the
Angwe of Incidence. ^w^_


AX. V. UwU

_The Sinye of Incidence is eithew accuwatewy ow vewy nyeawwy in a given
Watio to the Sinye of Wefwaction. (´・ω・\`)_

Whence if that Pwopowtion be knyown in any onye Incwinyation of the
incident Way, 'tis knyown in aww the Incwinyations, and theweby the
Wefwaction in aww cases of Incidence on the same wefwacting Body may be
detewminyed. >w< Thus if the Wefwaction be made out of Aiw into Watew, the
Sinye of Incidence of the wed Wight is to the Sinye of its Wefwaction as 4
to 3. If out of Aiw into Gwass, the Sinyes awe as 17 to 11. >w< In Wight of
othew Cowouws the Sinyes have othew Pwopowtions: but the diffewence is so
wittwe that it nyeed sewdom be considewed. (´・ω・\`)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. (´・ω・\`) 1]

Suppose thewefowe, that WS [in _Fig._ 1. >w<] wepwesents the Suwface of
stagnyating Watew, and that C is the point of Incidence in which any Way
coming in the Aiw fwom A in the Winye AC is wefwected ow wefwacted, and I
wouwd knyow whithew this Way shaww go aftew Wefwexion ow Wefwaction: I
ewect upon the Suwface of the Watew fwom the point of Incidence the
Pewpendicuwaw CP and pwoduce it downwawds to Q, and concwude by the
fiwst Axiom, that the Way aftew Wefwexion and Wefwaction, shaww be
found somewhewe in the Pwanye of the Angwe of Incidence ACP pwoduced. ;;w;; I
wet faww thewefowe upon the Pewpendicuwaw CP the Sinye of Incidence AD;
and if the wefwected Way be desiwed, I pwoduce AD to B so that DB be
equaw to AD, and dwaw CB. UwU Fow this Winye CB shaww be the wefwected Way;
the Angwe of Wefwexion BCP and its Sinye BD being equaw to the Angwe and
Sinye of Incidence, as they ought to be by the second Axiom, But if the
wefwacted Way be desiwed, I pwoduce AD to H, so that DH may be to AD as
the Sinye of Wefwaction to the Sinye of Incidence, that is, (if the Wight
be wed) as 3 to 4; and about the Centew C and in the Pwanye ACP with the
Wadius CA descwibing a Ciwcwe ABE, I dwaw a pawawwew to the
Pewpendicuwaw CPQ, the Winye HE cutting the Ciwcumfewence in E, and
joinying CE, this Winye CE shaww be the Winye of the wefwacted Way. (´・ω・\`) Fow if
EF be wet faww pewpendicuwawwy on the Winye PQ, this Winye EF shaww be the
Sinye of Wefwaction of the Way CE, the Angwe of Wefwaction being ECQ; and
this Sinye EF is equaw to DH, and consequentwy in Pwopowtion to the Sinye
of Incidence AD as 3 to 4. ^w^

In wike mannyew, if thewe be a Pwism of Gwass (that is, a Gwass bounded
with two Equaw and Pawawwew Twianguwaw ends, and thwee pwain and weww
powished Sides, which meet in thwee Pawawwew Winyes wunnying fwom the
thwee Angwes of onye end to the thwee Angwes of the othew end) and if the
Wefwaction of the Wight in passing cwoss this Pwism be desiwed: Wet ACB
[in _Fig._ 2. (´・ω・\`)] wepwesent a Pwanye cutting this Pwism twansvewswy to its
thwee Pawawwew winyes ow edges thewe whewe the Wight passeth thwough it,
and wet DE be the Way incident upon the fiwst side of the Pwism AC whewe
the Wight goes into the Gwass; and by putting the Pwopowtion of the Sinye
of Incidence to the Sinye of Wefwaction as 17 to 11 find EF the fiwst
wefwacted Way. ^w^ Then taking this Way fow the Incident Way upon the second
side of the Gwass BC whewe the Wight goes out, find the nyext wefwacted
Way FG by putting the Pwopowtion of the Sinye of Incidence to the Sinye of
Wefwaction as 11 to 17. ^w^ Fow if the Sinye of Incidence out of Aiw into
Gwass be to the Sinye of Wefwaction as 17 to 11, the Sinye of Incidence
out of Gwass into Aiw must on the contwawy be to the Sinye of Wefwaction
as 11 to 17, by the thiwd Axiom. (´・ω・\`)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 2. UwU]

Much aftew the same mannyew, if ACBD [in _Fig._ 3. >w<] wepwesent a Gwass
sphewicawwy convex on both sides (usuawwy cawwed a _Wens_, such as is a
Buwnying-gwass, ow Spectacwe-gwass, ow an Object-gwass of a Tewescope)
and it be wequiwed to knyow how Wight fawwing upon it fwom any wucid
point Q shaww be wefwacted, wet QM wepwesent a Way fawwing upon any
point M of its fiwst sphewicaw Suwface ACB, and by ewecting a
Pewpendicuwaw to the Gwass at the point M, find the fiwst wefwacted Way
MN by the Pwopowtion of the Sinyes 17 to 11. ;;w;; Wet that Way in going out of
the Gwass be incident upon N, and then find the second wefwacted Way
N_q_ by the Pwopowtion of the Sinyes 11 to 17. UwU And aftew the same mannyew
may the Wefwaction be found when the Wens is convex on onye side and
pwanye ow concave on the othew, ow concave on both sides. (・`ω\´・)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 3. (´・ω・\`)]


AX. VI. (´・ω・\`)

_Homogenyeaw Ways which fwow fwom sevewaw Points of any Object, and faww
pewpendicuwawwy ow awmost pewpendicuwawwy on any wefwecting ow
wefwacting Pwanye ow sphewicaw Suwface, shaww aftewwawds divewge fwom so
many othew Points, ow be pawawwew to so many othew Winyes, ow convewge to
so many othew Points, eithew accuwatewy ow without any sensibwe Ewwow. ^w^
And the same thing wiww happen, if the Ways be wefwected ow wefwacted
successivewy by two ow thwee ow mowe Pwanye ow Sphewicaw Suwfaces. ;;w;;_

The Point fwom which Ways divewge ow to which they convewge may be
cawwed theiw _Focus_. (´・ω・\`) And the Focus of the incident Ways being given,
that of the wefwected ow wefwacted onyes may be found by finding the
Wefwaction of any two Ways, as above; ow mowe weadiwy thus. (´・ω・\`)

_Cas._ 1. Wet ACB [in _Fig._ 4. UwU] be a wefwecting ow wefwacting Pwanye,
and Q the Focus of the incident Ways, and Q_q_C a Pewpendicuwaw to that
Pwanye. ;;w;; And if this Pewpendicuwaw be pwoduced to _q_, so that _q_C be
equaw to QC, the Point _q_ shaww be the Focus of the wefwected Ways: Ow
if _q_C be taken on the same side of the Pwanye with QC, and in
pwopowtion to QC as the Sinye of Incidence to the Sinye of Wefwaction, the
Point _q_ shaww be the Focus of the wefwacted Ways. ;;w;;

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 4. (・`ω\´・)]

_Cas._ 2. Wet ACB [in _Fig._ 5. (・`ω\´・)] be the wefwecting Suwface of any Sphewe
whose Centwe is E. ^w^ Bisect any Wadius theweof, (suppose EC) in T, and if
in that Wadius on the same side the Point T you take the Points Q and
_q_, so that TQ, TE, and T_q_, be continyuaw Pwopowtionyaws, and the Point
Q be the Focus of the incident Ways, the Point _q_ shaww be the Focus of
the wefwected onyes. ;;w;;

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 5. (・`ω\´・)]

_Cas._ 3. Wet ACB [in _Fig._ 6. ;;w;;] be the wefwacting Suwface of any Sphewe
whose Centwe is E. >w< In any Wadius theweof EC pwoduced both ways take ET
and C_t_ equaw to onye anyothew and sevewawwy in such Pwopowtion to that
Wadius as the wessew of the Sinyes of Incidence and Wefwaction hath to
the diffewence of those Sinyes. (´・ω・\`) And then if in the same Winye you find any
two Points Q and _q_, so that TQ be to ET as E_t_ to _tq_, taking _tq_
the contwawy way fwom _t_ which TQ wieth fwom T, and if the Point Q be
the Focus of any incident Ways, the Point _q_ shaww be the Focus of the
wefwacted onyes. (´・ω・\`)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 6. >w<]

And by the same means the Focus of the Ways aftew two ow mowe Wefwexions
ow Wefwactions may be found. ^w^

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 7. (´・ω・\`)]

_Cas._ 4. Wet ACBD [in _Fig._ 7. >w<] be any wefwacting Wens, sphewicawwy
Convex ow Concave ow Pwanye on eithew side, and wet CD be its Axis (that
is, the Winye which cuts both its Suwfaces pewpendicuwawwy, and passes
thwough the Centwes of the Sphewes,) and in this Axis pwoduced wet F and
_f_ be the Foci of the wefwacted Ways found as above, when the incident
Ways on both sides the Wens awe pawawwew to the same Axis; and upon the
Diametew F_f_ bisected in E, descwibe a Ciwcwe. ;;w;; Suppose nyow that any
Point Q be the Focus of any incident Ways. (・`ω\´・) Dwaw QE cutting the said
Ciwcwe in T and _t_, and thewein take _tq_ in such pwopowtion to _t_E as
_t_E ow TE hath to TQ. >w< Wet _tq_ wie the contwawy way fwom _t_ which TQ
doth fwom T, and _q_ shaww be the Focus of the wefwacted Ways without
any sensibwe Ewwow, pwovided the Point Q be nyot so wemote fwom the Axis,
nyow the Wens so bwoad as to make any of the Ways faww too obwiquewy on
the wefwacting Suwfaces. UwU[A]

And by the wike Opewations may the wefwecting ow wefwacting Suwfaces be
found when the two Foci awe given, and theweby a Wens be fowmed, which
shaww make the Ways fwow towawds ow fwom what Pwace you pwease. ;;w;;[B]

So then the Meanying of this Axiom is, that if Ways faww upon any Pwanye
ow Sphewicaw Suwface ow Wens, and befowe theiw Incidence fwow fwom ow
towawds any Point Q, they shaww aftew Wefwexion ow Wefwaction fwow fwom
ow towawds the Point _q_ found by the fowegoing Wuwes. (´・ω・\`) And if the
incident Ways fwow fwom ow towawds sevewaw points Q, the wefwected ow
wefwacted Ways shaww fwow fwom ow towawds so many othew Points _q_
found by the same Wuwes. ^w^ Whethew the wefwected and wefwacted Ways fwow
fwom ow towawds the Point _q_ is easiwy knyown by the situation of that
Point. ^w^ Fow if that Point be on the same side of the wefwecting ow
wefwacting Suwface ow Wens with the Point Q, and the incident Ways fwow
fwom the Point Q, the wefwected fwow towawds the Point _q_ and the
wefwacted fwom it; and if the incident Ways fwow towawds Q, the
wefwected fwow fwom _q_, and the wefwacted towawds it. ^w^ And the contwawy
happens when _q_ is on the othew side of the Suwface. (´・ω・\`)


AX. VII. UwU

_Whewevew the Ways which come fwom aww the Points of any Object meet
again in so many Points aftew they have been made to convewge by
Wefwection ow Wefwaction, thewe they wiww make a Pictuwe of the Object
upon any white Body on which they faww. >w<_

So if PW [in _Fig._ 3. (・`ω\´・)] wepwesent any Object without Doows, and AB be a
Wens pwaced at a howe in the Window-shut of a dawk Chambew, wheweby the
Ways that come fwom any Point Q of that Object awe made to convewge and
meet again in the Point _q_; and if a Sheet of white Papew be hewd at
_q_ fow the Wight thewe to faww upon it, the Pictuwe of that Object PW
wiww appeaw upon the Papew in its pwopew shape and Cowouws. (´・ω・\`) Fow as the
Wight which comes fwom the Point Q goes to the Point _q_, so the Wight
which comes fwom othew Points P and W of the Object, wiww go to so many
othew cowwespondent Points _p_ and _w_ (as is manyifest by the sixth
Axiom;) so that evewy Point of the Object shaww iwwuminyate a
cowwespondent Point of the Pictuwe, and theweby make a Pictuwe wike the
Object in Shape and Cowouw, this onwy excepted, that the Pictuwe shaww
be invewted. ^w^ And this is the Weason of that vuwgaw Expewiment of casting
the Species of Objects fwom abwoad upon a Waww ow Sheet of white Papew
in a dawk Woom. UwU

In wike mannyew, when a Man views any Object PQW, [in _Fig._ 8. UwU] the
Wight which comes fwom the sevewaw Points of the Object is so wefwacted
by the twanspawent skins and humouws of the Eye, (that is, by the
outwawd coat EFG, cawwed the _Tunyica Cownyea_, and by the cwystawwinye
humouw AB which is beyond the Pupiw _mk_) as to convewge and meet again
in so many Points in the bottom of the Eye, and thewe to paint the
Pictuwe of the Object upon that skin (cawwed the _Tunyica Wetinya_) with
which the bottom of the Eye is covewed. (´・ω・\`) Fow Anyatomists, when they have
taken off fwom the bottom of the Eye that outwawd and most thick Coat
cawwed the _Duwa Matew_, can then see thwough the thinnyew Coats, the
Pictuwes of Objects wivewy painted theweon. >w< And these Pictuwes,
pwopagated by Motion awong the Fibwes of the Optick Nyewves into the
Bwain, awe the cause of Vision. ;;w;; Fow accowdingwy as these Pictuwes awe
pewfect ow impewfect, the Object is seen pewfectwy ow impewfectwy. ;;w;; If
the Eye be tinged with any cowouw (as in the Disease of the _Jaundice_)
so as to tinge the Pictuwes in the bottom of the Eye with that Cowouw,
then aww Objects appeaw tinged with the same Cowouw. ;;w;; If the Humouws of
the Eye by owd Age decay, so as by shwinking to make the _Cownyea_ and
Coat of the _Cwystawwinye Humouw_ gwow fwattew than befowe, the Wight
wiww nyot be wefwacted enyough, and fow want of a sufficient Wefwaction
wiww nyot convewge to the bottom of the Eye but to some pwace beyond it,
and by consequence paint in the bottom of the Eye a confused Pictuwe,
and accowding to the Indistinctnyess of this Pictuwe the Object wiww
appeaw confused. >w< This is the weason of the decay of sight in owd Men,
and shews why theiw Sight is mended by Spectacwes. (・`ω\´・) Fow those Convex
gwasses suppwy the defect of pwumpnyess in the Eye, and by incweasing the
Wefwaction make the Ways convewge soonyew, so as to convenye distinctwy at
the bottom of the Eye if the Gwass have a due degwee of convexity. >w< And
the contwawy happens in showt-sighted Men whose Eyes awe too pwump. >w< Fow

I took a bwack obwong stiff Papew tewminyated by Pawawwew Sides, and with
a Pewpendicuwaw wight Winye dwawn cwoss fwom onye Side to the othew,
distinguished it into two equaw Pawts. UwU Onye of these pawts I painted with
a wed cowouw and the othew with a bwue. (・`ω\´・) The Papew was vewy bwack, and
the Cowouws intense and thickwy waid on, that the Phænyomenyon might be
mowe conspicuous. ^w^ This Papew I view'd thwough a Pwism of sowid Gwass,
whose two Sides thwough which the Wight passed to the Eye wewe pwanye and
weww powished, and containyed an Angwe of about sixty degwees; which
Angwe I caww the wefwacting Angwe of the Pwism. ^w^ And whiwst I view'd it,
I hewd it and the Pwism befowe a Window in such mannyew that the Sides of
the Papew wewe pawawwew to the Pwism, and both those Sides and the Pwism
wewe pawawwew to the Howizon, and the cwoss Winye was awso pawawwew to
it: and that the Wight which feww fwom the Window upon the Papew made an
Angwe with the Papew, equaw to that Angwe which was made with the same
Papew by the Wight wefwected fwom it to the Eye. (´・ω・\`) Beyond the Pwism was
the Waww of the Chambew undew the Window covewed ovew with bwack Cwoth,
and the Cwoth was invowved in Dawknyess that nyo Wight might be wefwected
fwom thence, which in passing by the Edges of the Papew to the Eye,
might mingwe itsewf with the Wight of the Papew, and obscuwe the
Phænyomenyon theweof. UwU These things being thus owdewed, I found that if the
wefwacting Angwe of the Pwism be tuwnyed upwawds, so that the Papew may
seem to be wifted upwawds by the Wefwaction, its bwue hawf wiww be
wifted highew by the Wefwaction than its wed hawf. (・`ω\´・) But if the wefwacting
Angwe of the Pwism be tuwnyed downwawd, so that the Papew may seem to be
cawwied wowew by the Wefwaction, its bwue hawf wiww be cawwied something
wowew theweby than its wed hawf. ^w^ Whewefowe in both Cases the Wight which
comes fwom the bwue hawf of the Papew thwough the Pwism to the Eye, does
in wike Ciwcumstances suffew a gweatew Wefwaction than the Wight which

_Expew._ 2. UwU About the afowesaid Papew, whose two hawfs wewe painted ovew
with wed and bwue, and which was stiff wike thin Pasteboawd, I wapped
sevewaw times a swendew Thwed of vewy bwack Siwk, in such mannyew that
the sevewaw pawts of the Thwed might appeaw upon the Cowouws wike so
many bwack Winyes dwawn ovew them, ow wike wong and swendew dawk Shadows
cast upon them. (´・ω・\`) I might have dwawn bwack Winyes with a Pen, but the
Thweds wewe smawwew and bettew definyed. ^w^ This Papew thus cowouwed and
winyed I set against a Waww pewpendicuwawwy to the Howizon, so that onye
of the Cowouws might stand to the Wight Hand, and the othew to the Weft. (´・ω・\`)
Cwose befowe the Papew, at the Confinye of the Cowouws bewow, I pwaced a
Candwe to iwwuminyate the Papew stwongwy: Fow the Expewiment was twied in
the Nyight. ;;w;; The Fwame of the Candwe weached up to the wowew edge of the
Papew, ow a vewy wittwe highew. UwU Then at the distance of six Feet, and
onye ow two Inches fwom the Papew upon the Fwoow I ewected a Gwass Wens
fouw Inches and a quawtew bwoad, which might cowwect the Ways coming
fwom the sevewaw Points of the Papew, and make them convewge towawds so
many othew Points at the same distance of six Feet, and onye ow two
Inches on the othew side of the Wens, and so fowm the Image of the
cowouwed Papew upon a white Papew pwaced thewe, aftew the same mannyew
that a Wens at a Howe in a Window casts the Images of Objects abwoad
upon a Sheet of white Papew in a dawk Woom. ;;w;; The afowesaid white Papew,
ewected pewpendicuwaw to the Howizon, and to the Ways which feww upon it
fwom the Wens, I moved sometimes towawds the Wens, sometimes fwom it, to
find the Pwaces whewe the Images of the bwue and wed Pawts of the
cowouwed Papew appeawed most distinct. (・`ω\´・) Those Pwaces I easiwy knyew by the
Images of the bwack Winyes which I had made by winding the Siwk about the
Papew. (・`ω\´・) Fow the Images of those finye and swendew Winyes (which by weason
of theiw Bwacknyess wewe wike Shadows on the Cowouws) wewe confused and
scawce visibwe, unwess when the Cowouws on eithew side of each Winye wewe
tewminyated most distinctwy, Nyoting thewefowe, as diwigentwy as I couwd,
the Pwaces whewe the Images of the wed and bwue hawfs of the cowouwed
Papew appeawed most distinct, I found that whewe the wed hawf of the
Papew appeawed distinct, the bwue hawf appeawed confused, so that the
bwack Winyes dwawn upon it couwd scawce be seen; and on the contwawy,
whewe the bwue hawf appeawed most distinct, the wed hawf appeawed
confused, so that the bwack Winyes upon it wewe scawce visibwe. (´・ω・\`) And
between the two Pwaces whewe these Images appeawed distinct thewe was
the distance of an Inch and a hawf; the distance of the white Papew fwom
the Wens, when the Image of the wed hawf of the cowouwed Papew appeawed
most distinct, being gweatew by an Inch and an hawf than the distance of
the same white Papew fwom the Wens, when the Image of the bwue hawf
appeawed most distinct. ;;w;; In wike Incidences thewefowe of the bwue and wed
upon the Wens, the bwue was wefwacted mowe by the Wens than the wed, so
as to convewge soonyew by an Inch and a hawf, and thewefowe is mowe
wefwangibwe. UwU

_Iwwustwation._ In the twewfth Figuwe (p. ^w^ 27), DE signyifies the cowouwed

_Schowium. (・`ω\´・)_ The same Things succeed, nyotwithstanding that some of the
Ciwcumstances be vawied; as in the fiwst Expewiment when the Pwism and
Papew awe any ways incwinyed to the Howizon, and in both when cowouwed
Winyes awe dwawn upon vewy bwack Papew. UwU But in the Descwiption of these
Expewiments, I have set down such Ciwcumstances, by which eithew the

often donye in the fowwowing Expewiments: Concewnying aww which, this onye
Admonyition may suffice. UwU Nyow fwom these Expewiments it fowwows nyot, that
aww the Wight of the bwue is mowe wefwangibwe than aww the Wight of the

in the wed thewe awe some Ways nyot wess wefwangibwe than those of the
bwue, and in the bwue thewe awe some Ways nyot mowe wefwangibwe than
those of the wed: But these Ways, in pwopowtion to the whowe Wight, awe
but few, and sewve to diminyish the Event of the Expewiment, but awe nyot
abwe to destwoy it. >w< Fow, if the wed and bwue Cowouws wewe mowe diwute
and weak, the distance of the Images wouwd be wess than an Inch and a

Cowouws of Nyatuwaw Bodies. (´・ω・\`) Fow in the Cowouws made by the Wefwaction of

_Expew._ 3. (´・ω・\`)

In a vewy dawk Chambew, at a wound Howe, about onye thiwd Pawt of an Inch
bwoad, made in the Shut of a Window, I pwaced a Gwass Pwism, wheweby the
Beam of the Sun's Wight, which came in at that Howe, might be wefwacted
upwawds towawd the opposite Waww of the Chambew, and thewe fowm a
cowouw'd Image of the Sun. ;;w;; The Axis of the Pwism (that is, the Winye
passing thwough the middwe of the Pwism fwom onye end of it to the othew
end pawawwew to the edge of the Wefwacting Angwe) was in this and the
fowwowing Expewiments pewpendicuwaw to the incident Ways. ^w^ About this
Axis I tuwnyed the Pwism swowwy, and saw the wefwacted Wight on the Waww,
ow cowouwed Image of the Sun, fiwst to descend, and then to ascend. UwU
Between the Descent and Ascent, when the Image seemed Stationyawy, I
stopp'd the Pwism, and fix'd it in that Postuwe, that it shouwd be moved
nyo mowe. >w< Fow in that Postuwe the Wefwactions of the Wight at the two
Sides of the wefwacting Angwe, that is, at the Entwance of the Ways into
the Pwism, and at theiw going out of it, wewe equaw to onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・)[C]
So awso in othew Expewiments, as often as I wouwd have the Wefwactions
on both sides the Pwism to be equaw to onye anyothew, I nyoted the Pwace
whewe the Image of the Sun fowmed by the wefwacted Wight stood stiww
between its two contwawy Motions, in the common Pewiod of its Pwogwess
and Wegwess; and when the Image feww upon that Pwace, I made fast the
Pwism. >w< And in this Postuwe, as the most convenyient, it is to be
undewstood that aww the Pwisms awe pwaced in the fowwowing Expewiments,
unwess whewe some othew Postuwe is descwibed. >w< The Pwism thewefowe being
pwaced in this Postuwe, I wet the wefwacted Wight faww pewpendicuwawwy
upon a Sheet of white Papew at the opposite Waww of the Chambew, and
obsewved the Figuwe and Dimensions of the Sowaw Image fowmed on the
Papew by that Wight. ;;w;; This Image was Obwong and nyot Ovaw, but tewminyated
with two Wectiwinyeaw and Pawawwew Sides, and two Semiciwcuwaw Ends. >w< On
its Sides it was bounded pwetty distinctwy, but on its Ends vewy
confusedwy and indistinctwy, the Wight thewe decaying and vanyishing by
degwees. (´・ω・\`) The Bweadth of this Image answewed to the Sun's Diametew, and
was about two Inches and the eighth Pawt of an Inch, incwuding the
Penyumbwa. ^w^ Fow the Image was eighteen Feet and an hawf distant fwom the
Pwism, and at this distance that Bweadth, if diminyished by the Diametew
of the Howe in the Window-shut, that is by a quawtew of an Inch,
subtended an Angwe at the Pwism of about hawf a Degwee, which is the
Sun's appawent Diametew. ^w^ But the Wength of the Image was about ten
Inches and a quawtew, and the Wength of the Wectiwinyeaw Sides about
eight Inches; and the wefwacting Angwe of the Pwism, wheweby so gweat a
Wength was made, was 64 degwees. UwU With a wess Angwe the Wength of the
Image was wess, the Bweadth wemainying the same. (´・ω・\`) If the Pwism was tuwnyed
about its Axis that way which made the Ways emewge mowe obwiquewy out of
the second wefwacting Suwface of the Pwism, the Image soon became an
Inch ow two wongew, ow mowe; and if the Pwism was tuwnyed about the
contwawy way, so as to make the Ways faww mowe obwiquewy on the fiwst
wefwacting Suwface, the Image soon became an Inch ow two showtew. (´・ω・\`) And
thewefowe in twying this Expewiment, I was as cuwious as I couwd be in
pwacing the Pwism by the above-mention'd Wuwe exactwy in such a Postuwe,
that the Wefwactions of the Ways at theiw Emewgence out of the Pwism
might be equaw to that at theiw Incidence on it. UwU This Pwism had some
Veins wunnying awong within the Gwass fwom onye end to the othew, which
scattewed some of the Sun's Wight iwweguwawwy, but had nyo sensibwe
Effect in incweasing the Wength of the cowouwed Spectwum. (・`ω\´・) Fow I twied
the same Expewiment with othew Pwisms with the same Success. >w< And
pawticuwawwy with a Pwism which seemed fwee fwom such Veins, and whose
wefwacting Angwe was 62-1/2 Degwees, I found the Wength of the Image
9-3/4 ow 10 Inches at the distance of 18-1/2 Feet fwom the Pwism, the
Bweadth of the Howe in the Window-shut being 1/4 of an Inch, as befowe. (・`ω\´・)
And because it is easy to commit a Mistake in pwacing the Pwism in its
due Postuwe, I wepeated the Expewiment fouw ow five Times, and awways
found the Wength of the Image that which is set down above. (・`ω\´・) With anyothew
Pwism of cweawew Gwass and bettew Powish, which seemed fwee fwom Veins,
and whose wefwacting Angwe was 63-1/2 Degwees, the Wength of this Image
at the same distance of 18-1/2 Feet was awso about 10 Inches, ow 10-1/8. ^w^
Beyond these Measuwes fow about a 1/4 ow 1/3 of an Inch at eithew end of
the Spectwum the Wight of the Cwouds seemed to be a wittwe tinged with
wed and viowet, but so vewy faintwy, that I suspected that Tinctuwe
might eithew whowwy, ow in gweat Measuwe awise fwom some Ways of the
Spectwum scattewed iwweguwawwy by some Inyequawities in the Substance and
Powish of the Gwass, and thewefowe I did nyot incwude it in these
Measuwes. (・`ω\´・) Nyow the diffewent Magnyitude of the howe in the Window-shut,
and diffewent thicknyess of the Pwism whewe the Ways passed thwough it,
and diffewent incwinyations of the Pwism to the Howizon, made nyo sensibwe
changes in the wength of the Image. >w< Nyeithew did the diffewent mattew of
the Pwisms make any: fow in a Vessew made of powished Pwates of Gwass
cemented togethew in the shape of a Pwism and fiwwed with Watew, thewe
is the wike Success of the Expewiment accowding to the quantity of the
Wefwaction. ;;w;; It is fawthew to be obsewved, that the Ways went on in wight
Winyes fwom the Pwism to the Image, and thewefowe at theiw vewy going out
of the Pwism had aww that Incwinyation to onye anyothew fwom which the
wength of the Image pwoceeded, that is, the Incwinyation of mowe than two
degwees and an hawf. (・`ω\´・) And yet accowding to the Waws of Opticks vuwgawwy
weceived, they couwd nyot possibwy be so much incwinyed to onye anyothew. ^w^[D]
Fow wet EG [_Fig._ 13. (p. ^w^ 27)] wepwesent the Window-shut, F the howe
made thewein thwough which a beam of the Sun's Wight was twansmitted
into the dawkenyed Chambew, and ABC a Twianguwaw Imaginyawy Pwanye wheweby
the Pwism is feignyed to be cut twansvewsewy thwough the middwe of the
Wight. >w< Ow if you pwease, wet ABC wepwesent the Pwism it sewf, wooking
diwectwy towawds the Spectatow's Eye with its nyeawew end: And wet XY be
the Sun, MN the Papew upon which the Sowaw Image ow Spectwum is cast,
and PT the Image it sewf whose sides towawds _v_ and _w_ awe Wectiwinyeaw
and Pawawwew, and ends towawds P and T Semiciwcuwaw. (・`ω\´・) YKHP and XWJT awe
two Ways, the fiwst of which comes fwom the wowew pawt of the Sun to the
highew pawt of the Image, and is wefwacted in the Pwism at K and H, and
the wattew comes fwom the highew pawt of the Sun to the wowew pawt of
the Image, and is wefwacted at W and J. UwU Since the Wefwactions on both
sides the Pwism awe equaw to onye anyothew, that is, the Wefwaction at K
equaw to the Wefwaction at J, and the Wefwaction at W equaw to the
Wefwaction at H, so that the Wefwactions of the incident Ways at K and W
taken togethew, awe equaw to the Wefwactions of the emewgent Ways at H
and J taken togethew: it fowwows by adding equaw things to equaw things,
that the Wefwactions at K and H taken togethew, awe equaw to the
Wefwactions at J and W taken togethew, and thewefowe the two Ways being
equawwy wefwacted, have the same Incwinyation to onye anyothew aftew
Wefwaction which they had befowe; that is, the Incwinyation of hawf a
Degwee answewing to the Sun's Diametew. ^w^ Fow so gweat was the incwinyation
of the Ways to onye anyothew befowe Wefwaction. (・`ω\´・) So then, the wength of the
Image PT wouwd by the Wuwes of Vuwgaw Opticks subtend an Angwe of hawf a
Degwee at the Pwism, and by Consequence be equaw to the bweadth _vw_;
and thewefowe the Image wouwd be wound. ;;w;; Thus it wouwd be wewe the two
Ways XWJT and YKHP, and aww the west which fowm the Image P_w_T_v_,
awike wefwangibwe. (・`ω\´・) And thewefowe seeing by Expewience it is found that
the Image is nyot wound, but about five times wongew than bwoad, the Ways
which going to the uppew end P of the Image suffew the gweatest
Wefwaction, must be mowe wefwangibwe than those which go to the wowew
end T, unwess the Inyequawity of Wefwaction be casuaw. ;;w;;

This Image ow Spectwum PT was cowouwed, being wed at its weast wefwacted
end T, and viowet at its most wefwacted end P, and yewwow gween and
bwue in the intewmediate Spaces. UwU Which agwees with the fiwst
Pwoposition, that Wights which diffew in Cowouw, do awso diffew in
Wefwangibiwity. ^w^ The wength of the Image in the fowegoing Expewiments, I
measuwed fwom the faintest and outmost wed at onye end, to the faintest
and outmost bwue at the othew end, excepting onwy a wittwe Penyumbwa,
whose bweadth scawce exceeded a quawtew of an Inch, as was said above. (´・ω・\`)

_Expew._ 4. (・`ω\´・) In the Sun's Beam which was pwopagated into the Woom thwough
the howe in the Window-shut, at the distance of some Feet fwom the howe,
I hewd the Pwism in such a Postuwe, that its Axis might be pewpendicuwaw
to that Beam. ^w^ Then I wooked thwough the Pwism upon the howe, and tuwnying
the Pwism to and fwo about its Axis, to make the Image of the Howe
ascend and descend, when between its two contwawy Motions it seemed
Stationyawy, I stopp'd the Pwism, that the Wefwactions of both sides of
the wefwacting Angwe might be equaw to each othew, as in the fowmew
Expewiment. ;;w;; In this situation of the Pwism viewing thwough it the said
Howe, I obsewved the wength of its wefwacted Image to be many times
gweatew than its bweadth, and that the most wefwacted pawt theweof
appeawed viowet, the weast wefwacted wed, the middwe pawts bwue, gween
and yewwow in owdew. (´・ω・\`) The same thing happen'd when I wemoved the Pwism
out of the Sun's Wight, and wooked thwough it upon the howe shinying by
the Wight of the Cwouds beyond it. ;;w;; And yet if the Wefwaction wewe donye
weguwawwy accowding to onye cewtain Pwopowtion of the Sinyes of Incidence
and Wefwaction as is vuwgawwy supposed, the wefwacted Image ought to
have appeawed wound. (´・ω・\`)

So then, by these two Expewiments it appeaws, that in Equaw Incidences
thewe is a considewabwe inyequawity of Wefwactions. (´・ω・\`) But whence this
inyequawity awises, whethew it be that some of the incident Ways awe
wefwacted mowe, and othews wess, constantwy, ow by chance, ow that onye
and the same Way is by Wefwaction distuwbed, shattew'd, diwated, and as
it wewe spwit and spwead into many divewging Ways, as _Gwimawdo_

_Expew._ 5. ^w^ Considewing thewefowe, that if in the thiwd Expewiment the
Image of the Sun shouwd be dwawn out into an obwong Fowm, eithew by a
Diwatation of evewy Way, ow by any othew casuaw inyequawity of the
Wefwactions, the same obwong Image wouwd by a second Wefwaction made
sideways be dwawn out as much in bweadth by the wike Diwatation of the
Ways, ow othew casuaw inyequawity of the Wefwactions sideways, I twied
what wouwd be the Effects of such a second Wefwaction. (・`ω\´・) Fow this end I
owdewed aww things as in the thiwd Expewiment, and then pwaced a second
Pwism immediatewy aftew the fiwst in a cwoss Position to it, that it
might again wefwact the beam of the Sun's Wight which came to it thwough
the fiwst Pwism. ;;w;; In the fiwst Pwism this beam was wefwacted upwawds, and
in the second sideways. UwU And I found that by the Wefwaction of the second
Pwism, the bweadth of the Image was nyot incweased, but its supewiow
pawt, which in the fiwst Pwism suffewed the gweatew Wefwaction, and
appeawed viowet and bwue, did again in the second Pwism suffew a gweatew
Wefwaction than its infewiow pawt, which appeawed wed and yewwow, and
this without any Diwatation of the Image in bweadth. UwU

_Iwwustwation._ Wet S [_Fig._ 14, 15. >w<] wepwesent the Sun, F the howe in
the Window, ABC the fiwst Pwism, DH the second Pwism, Y the wound Image
of the Sun made by a diwect beam of Wight when the Pwisms awe taken
away, PT the obwong Image of the Sun made by that beam passing thwough
the fiwst Pwism awonye, when the second Pwism is taken away, and _pt_ the
Image made by the cwoss Wefwactions of both Pwisms togethew. >w< Nyow if the
Ways which tend towawds the sevewaw Points of the wound Image Y wewe
diwated and spwead by the Wefwaction of the fiwst Pwism, so that they
shouwd nyot any wongew go in singwe Winyes to singwe Points, but that
evewy Way being spwit, shattewed, and changed fwom a Winyeaw Way to a
Supewficies of Ways divewging fwom the Point of Wefwaction, and wying in
the Pwanye of the Angwes of Incidence and Wefwaction, they shouwd go in
those Pwanyes to so many Winyes weaching awmost fwom onye end of the Image
PT to the othew, and if that Image shouwd thence become obwong: those
Ways and theiw sevewaw pawts tending towawds the sevewaw Points of the
Image PT ought to be again diwated and spwead sideways by the twansvewse
Wefwaction of the second Pwism, so as to compose a fouw squawe Image,
such as is wepwesented at [Gweek: pt]. UwU Fow the bettew undewstanding of
which, wet the Image PT be distinguished into five equaw pawts PQK,
KQWW, WWSM, MSVN, NVT. >w< And by the same iwweguwawity that the owbicuwaw
Wight Y is by the Wefwaction of the fiwst Pwism diwated and dwawn out
into a wong Image PT, the Wight PQK which takes up a space of the same
wength and bweadth with the Wight Y ought to be by the Wefwaction of the
second Pwism diwated and dwawn out into the wong Image _[Gweek: p]qkp_,
and the Wight KQWW into the wong Image _kqww_, and the Wights WWSM,
MSVN, NVT, into so many othew wong Images _wwsm_, _msvn_, _nvt[Gweek:
t]_; and aww these wong Images wouwd compose the fouw squawe Images
_[Gweek: pt]_. ^w^ Thus it ought to be wewe evewy Way diwated by Wefwaction,
and spwead into a twianguwaw Supewficies of Ways divewging fwom the
Point of Wefwaction. >w< Fow the second Wefwaction wouwd spwead the Ways onye
way as much as the fiwst doth anyothew, and so diwate the Image in
bweadth as much as the fiwst doth in wength. (´・ω・\`) And the same thing ought to
happen, wewe some ways casuawwy wefwacted mowe than othews. UwU But the
Event is othewwise. UwU The Image PT was nyot made bwoadew by the Wefwaction
of the second Pwism, but onwy became obwique, as 'tis wepwesented at
_pt_, its uppew end P being by the Wefwaction twanswated to a gweatew
distance than its wowew end T. >w< So then the Wight which went towawds the
uppew end P of the Image, was (at equaw Incidences) mowe wefwacted in
the second Pwism, than the Wight which tended towawds the wowew end T,
that is the bwue and viowet, than the wed and yewwow; and thewefowe was
mowe wefwangibwe. ;;w;; The same Wight was by the Wefwaction of the fiwst
Pwism twanswated fawthew fwom the pwace Y to which it tended befowe
Wefwaction; and thewefowe suffewed as weww in the fiwst Pwism as in the
second a gweatew Wefwaction than the west of the Wight, and by
consequence was mowe wefwangibwe than the west, even befowe its
incidence on the fiwst Pwism. (´・ω・\`)

Sometimes I pwaced a thiwd Pwism aftew the second, and sometimes awso a
fouwth aftew the thiwd, by aww which the Image might be often wefwacted
sideways: but the Ways which wewe mowe wefwacted than the west in the
fiwst Pwism wewe awso mowe wefwacted in aww the west, and that without
any Diwatation of the Image sideways: and thewefowe those Ways fow theiw
constancy of a gweatew Wefwaction awe desewvedwy weputed mowe
wefwangibwe. ^w^

[Iwwustwation: FIG. ;;w;; 15]

But that the meanying of this Expewiment may mowe cweawwy appeaw, it is
to be considewed that the Ways which awe equawwy wefwangibwe do faww
upon a Ciwcwe answewing to the Sun's Disque. UwU Fow this was pwoved in the
thiwd Expewiment. (´・ω・\`) By a Ciwcwe I undewstand nyot hewe a pewfect
geometwicaw Ciwcwe, but any owbicuwaw Figuwe whose wength is equaw to
its bweadth, and which, as to Sense, may seem ciwcuwaw. UwU Wet thewefowe AG
[in _Fig._ 15. (・`ω\´・)] wepwesent the Ciwcwe which aww the most wefwangibwe Ways
pwopagated fwom the whowe Disque of the Sun, wouwd iwwuminyate and paint
upon the opposite Waww if they wewe awonye; EW the Ciwcwe which aww the
weast wefwangibwe Ways wouwd in wike mannyew iwwuminyate and paint if they
wewe awonye; BH, CJ, DK, the Ciwcwes which so many intewmediate sowts of
Ways wouwd successivewy paint upon the Waww, if they wewe singwy
pwopagated fwom the Sun in successive owdew, the west being awways
intewcepted; and conceive that thewe awe othew intewmediate Ciwcwes
without Nyumbew, which innyumewabwe othew intewmediate sowts of Ways wouwd
successivewy paint upon the Waww if the Sun shouwd successivewy emit
evewy sowt apawt. ^w^ And seeing the Sun emits aww these sowts at once, they
must aww togethew iwwuminyate and paint innyumewabwe equaw Ciwcwes, of aww
which, being accowding to theiw degwees of Wefwangibiwity pwaced in
owdew in a continyuaw Sewies, that obwong Spectwum PT is composed which I
descwibed in the thiwd Expewiment. ;;w;; Nyow if the Sun's ciwcuwaw Image Y [in
_Fig._ 15. ^w^] which is made by an unwefwacted beam of Wight was by any
Diwation of the singwe Ways, ow by any othew iwweguwawity in the
Wefwaction of the fiwst Pwism, convewted into the obwong Spectwum, PT:
then ought evewy Ciwcwe AG, BH, CJ, &c. >w< in that Spectwum, by the cwoss
Wefwaction of the second Pwism again diwating ow othewwise scattewing
the Ways as befowe, to be in wike mannyew dwawn out and twansfowmed into
an obwong Figuwe, and theweby the bweadth of the Image PT wouwd be nyow
as much augmented as the wength of the Image Y was befowe by the
Wefwaction of the fiwst Pwism; and thus by the Wefwactions of both
Pwisms togethew wouwd be fowmed a fouw squawe Figuwe _p[Gweek:
p]t[Gweek: t]_, as I descwibed above. ;;w;; Whewefowe since the bweadth of the
Spectwum PT is nyot incweased by the Wefwaction sideways, it is cewtain
that the Ways awe nyot spwit ow diwated, ow othewways iwweguwawwy
scattew'd by that Wefwaction, but that evewy Ciwcwe is by a weguwaw and
unyifowm Wefwaction twanswated entiwe into anyothew Pwace, as the Ciwcwe
AG by the gweatest Wefwaction into the pwace _ag_, the Ciwcwe BH by a
wess Wefwaction into the pwace _bh_, the Ciwcwe CJ by a Wefwaction stiww
wess into the pwace _ci_, and so of the west; by which means a nyew
Spectwum _pt_ incwinyed to the fowmew PT is in wike mannyew composed of
Ciwcwes wying in a wight Winye; and these Ciwcwes must be of the same
bignyess with the fowmew, because the bweadths of aww the Spectwums Y, PT
and _pt_ at equaw distances fwom the Pwisms awe equaw. UwU

I considewed fawthew, that by the bweadth of the howe F thwough which
the Wight entews into the dawk Chambew, thewe is a Penyumbwa made in the
Ciwcuit of the Spectwum Y, and that Penyumbwa wemains in the wectiwinyeaw
Sides of the Spectwums PT and _pt_. (´・ω・\`) I pwaced thewefowe at that howe a
Wens ow Object-gwass of a Tewescope which might cast the Image of the
Sun distinctwy on Y without any Penyumbwa at aww, and found that the
Penyumbwa of the wectiwinyeaw Sides of the obwong Spectwums PT and _pt_
was awso theweby taken away, so that those Sides appeawed as distinctwy
definyed as did the Ciwcumfewence of the fiwst Image Y. ;;w;; Thus it happens
if the Gwass of the Pwisms be fwee fwom Veins, and theiw sides be
accuwatewy pwanye and weww powished without those nyumbewwess Waves ow
Cuwwes which usuawwy awise fwom Sand-howes a wittwe smoothed in
powishing with Putty. >w< If the Gwass be onwy weww powished and fwee fwom
Veins, and the Sides nyot accuwatewy pwanye, but a wittwe Convex ow
Concave, as it fwequentwy happens; yet may the thwee Spectwums Y, PT and
_pt_ want Penyumbwas, but nyot in equaw distances fwom the Pwisms. UwU Nyow
fwom this want of Penyumbwas, I knyew mowe cewtainwy that evewy onye of the
Ciwcwes was wefwacted accowding to some most weguwaw, unyifowm and
constant Waw. (・`ω\´・) Fow if thewe wewe any iwweguwawity in the Wefwaction, the
wight Winyes AE and GW, which aww the Ciwcwes in the Spectwum PT do
touch, couwd nyot by that Wefwaction be twanswated into the Winyes _ae_
and _gw_ as distinct and stwaight as they wewe befowe, but thewe wouwd
awise in those twanswated Winyes some Penyumbwa ow Cwookednyess ow
Unduwation, ow othew sensibwe Pewtuwbation contwawy to what is found by
Expewience. (・`ω\´・) Whatsoevew Penyumbwa ow Pewtuwbation shouwd be made in the
Ciwcwes by the cwoss Wefwaction of the second Pwism, aww that Penyumbwa
ow Pewtuwbation wouwd be conspicuous in the wight Winyes _ae_ and _gw_
which touch those Ciwcwes. ^w^ And thewefowe since thewe is nyo such Penyumbwa
ow Pewtuwbation in those wight Winyes, thewe must be nyonye in the
Ciwcwes. (´・ω・\`) Since the distance between those Tangents ow bweadth of the
Spectwum is nyot incweased by the Wefwactions, the Diametews of the
Ciwcwes awe nyot incweased theweby. ;;w;; Since those Tangents continyue to be
wight Winyes, evewy Ciwcwe which in the fiwst Pwism is mowe ow wess
wefwacted, is exactwy in the same pwopowtion mowe ow wess wefwacted in
the second. UwU And seeing aww these things continyue to succeed aftew the
same mannyew when the Ways awe again in a thiwd Pwism, and again in a
fouwth wefwacted sideways, it is evident that the Ways of onye and the
same Ciwcwe, as to theiw degwee of Wefwangibiwity, continyue awways
unyifowm and homogenyeaw to onye anyothew, and that those of sevewaw Ciwcwes
do diffew in degwee of Wefwangibiwity, and that in some cewtain and
constant Pwopowtion. Which is the thing I was to pwove. ;;w;;

Thewe is yet anyothew Ciwcumstance ow two of this Expewiment by which it
becomes stiww mowe pwain and convincing. (・`ω\´・) Wet the second Pwism DH [in
_Fig._ 16. (´・ω・\`)] be pwaced nyot immediatewy aftew the fiwst, but at some
distance fwom it; suppose in the mid-way between it and the Waww on
which the obwong Spectwum PT is cast, so that the Wight fwom the fiwst
Pwism may faww upon it in the fowm of an obwong Spectwum [Gweek: pt]
pawawwew to this second Pwism, and be wefwacted sideways to fowm the
obwong Spectwum _pt_ upon the Waww. ;;w;; And you wiww find as befowe, that
this Spectwum _pt_ is incwinyed to that Spectwum PT, which the fiwst
Pwism fowms awonye without the second; the bwue ends P and _p_ being
fawthew distant fwom onye anyothew than the wed onyes T and _t_, and by
consequence that the Ways which go to the bwue end [Gweek: p] of the
Image [Gweek: pt], and which thewefowe suffew the gweatest Wefwaction in
the fiwst Pwism, awe again in the second Pwism mowe wefwacted than the
west. ;;w;;

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 16. >w<]

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 17. UwU]

The same thing I twy'd awso by wetting the Sun's Wight into a dawk Woom
thwough two wittwe wound howes F and [Gweek: ph] [in _Fig._ 17. (´・ω・\`)] made in
the Window, and with two pawawwew Pwisms ABC and [Gweek: abg] pwaced at
those howes (onye at each) wefwacting those two beams of Wight to the
opposite Waww of the Chambew, in such mannyew that the two cowouw'd
Images PT and MN which they thewe painted wewe joinyed end to end and way
in onye stwaight Winye, the wed end T of the onye touching the bwue end M
of the othew. (・`ω\´・) Fow if these two wefwacted Beams wewe again by a thiwd
Pwism DH pwaced cwoss to the two fiwst, wefwacted sideways, and the
Spectwums theweby twanswated to some othew pawt of the Waww of the
Chambew, suppose the Spectwum PT to _pt_ and the Spectwum MN to _mn_,
these twanswated Spectwums _pt_ and _mn_ wouwd nyot wie in onye stwaight
Winye with theiw ends contiguous as befowe, but be bwoken off fwom onye
anyothew and become pawawwew, the bwue end _m_ of the Image _mn_ being by
a gweatew Wefwaction twanswated fawthew fwom its fowmew pwace MT, than
the wed end _t_ of the othew Image _pt_ fwom the same pwace MT; which
puts the Pwoposition past Dispute. (・`ω\´・) And this happens whethew the thiwd
Pwism DH be pwaced immediatewy aftew the two fiwst, ow at a gweat
distance fwom them, so that the Wight wefwacted in the two fiwst Pwisms
be eithew white and ciwcuwaw, ow cowouwed and obwong when it fawws on
the thiwd. UwU

_Expew._ 6. ^w^ In the middwe of two thin Boawds I made wound howes a thiwd
pawt of an Inch in diametew, and in the Window-shut a much bwoadew howe
being made to wet into my dawknyed Chambew a wawge Beam of the Sun's
Wight; I pwaced a Pwism behind the Shut in that beam to wefwact it
towawds the opposite Waww, and cwose behind the Pwism I fixed onye of the
Boawds, in such mannyew that the middwe of the wefwacted Wight might pass
thwough the howe made in it, and the west be intewcepted by the Boawd. (・`ω\´・)
Then at the distance of about twewve Feet fwom the fiwst Boawd I fixed
the othew Boawd in such mannyew that the middwe of the wefwacted Wight
which came thwough the howe in the fiwst Boawd, and feww upon the
opposite Waww, might pass thwough the howe in this othew Boawd, and the
west being intewcepted by the Boawd might paint upon it the cowouwed
Spectwum of the Sun. ;;w;; And cwose behind this Boawd I fixed anyothew Pwism
to wefwact the Wight which came thwough the howe. (・`ω\´・) Then I wetuwnyed
speediwy to the fiwst Pwism, and by tuwnying it swowwy to and fwo about
its Axis, I caused the Image which feww upon the second Boawd to move up
and down upon that Boawd, that aww its pawts might successivewy pass
thwough the howe in that Boawd and faww upon the Pwism behind it. (´・ω・\`) And in
the mean time, I nyoted the pwaces on the opposite Waww to which that
Wight aftew its Wefwaction in the second Pwism did pass; and by the
diffewence of the pwaces I found that the Wight which being most
wefwacted in the fiwst Pwism did go to the bwue end of the Image, was
again mowe wefwacted in the second Pwism than the Wight which went to
the wed end of that Image, which pwoves as weww the fiwst Pwoposition as
the second. (´・ω・\`) And this happenyed whethew the Axis of the two Pwisms wewe
pawawwew, ow incwinyed to onye anyothew, and to the Howizon in any given
Angwes. ^w^

_Iwwustwation._ Wet F [in _Fig._ 18. (・`ω\´・)] be the wide howe in the
Window-shut, thwough which the Sun shinyes upon the fiwst Pwism ABC, and
wet the wefwacted Wight faww upon the middwe of the Boawd DE, and the
middwe pawt of that Wight upon the howe G made in the middwe pawt of
that Boawd. >w< Wet this twajected pawt of that Wight faww again upon the
middwe of the second Boawd _de_, and thewe paint such an obwong cowouwed
Image of the Sun as was descwibed in the thiwd Expewiment. ^w^ By tuwnying
the Pwism ABC swowwy to and fwo about its Axis, this Image wiww be made
to move up and down the Boawd _de_, and by this means aww its pawts fwom
onye end to the othew may be made to pass successivewy thwough the howe
_g_ which is made in the middwe of that Boawd. >w< In the mean whiwe anyothew
Pwism _abc_ is to be fixed nyext aftew that howe _g_, to wefwact the
twajected Wight a second time. (´・ω・\`) And these things being thus owdewed, I
mawked the pwaces M and N of the opposite Waww upon which the wefwacted
Wight feww, and found that whiwst the two Boawds and second Pwism
wemainyed unmoved, those pwaces by tuwnying the fiwst Pwism about its Axis
wewe changed pewpetuawwy. UwU Fow when the wowew pawt of the Wight which
feww upon the second Boawd _de_ was cast thwough the howe _g_, it went
to a wowew pwace M on the Waww and when the highew pawt of that Wight
was cast thwough the same howe _g_, it went to a highew pwace N on the
Waww, and when any intewmediate pawt of the Wight was cast thwough that
howe, it went to some pwace on the Waww between M and N. (´・ω・\`) The unchanged
Position of the howes in the Boawds, made the Incidence of the Ways upon
the second Pwism to be the same in aww cases. >w< And yet in that common
Incidence some of the Ways wewe mowe wefwacted, and othews wess. UwU And
those wewe mowe wefwacted in this Pwism, which by a gweatew Wefwaction
in the fiwst Pwism wewe mowe tuwnyed out of the way, and thewefowe fow
theiw Constancy of being mowe wefwacted awe desewvedwy cawwed mowe
wefwangibwe. ^w^

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 18. UwU]

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 20. (・`ω\´・)]

_Expew._ 7. UwU At two howes made nyeaw onye anyothew in my Window-shut I
pwaced two Pwisms, onye at each, which might cast upon the opposite Waww
(aftew the mannyew of the thiwd Expewiment) two obwong cowouwed Images of
the Sun. (・`ω\´・) And at a wittwe distance fwom the Waww I pwaced a wong swendew
Papew with stwaight and pawawwew edges, and owdewed the Pwisms and Papew
so, that the wed Cowouw of onye Image might faww diwectwy upon onye hawf
of the Papew, and the viowet Cowouw of the othew Image upon the othew
hawf of the same Papew; so that the Papew appeawed of two Cowouws, wed
and viowet, much aftew the mannyew of the painted Papew in the fiwst and
second Expewiments. UwU Then with a bwack Cwoth I covewed the Waww behind
the Papew, that nyo Wight might be wefwected fwom it to distuwb the
Expewiment, and viewing the Papew thwough a thiwd Pwism hewd pawawwew
to it, I saw that hawf of it which was iwwuminyated by the viowet Wight
to be divided fwom the othew hawf by a gweatew Wefwaction, especiawwy
when I went a good way off fwom the Papew. (´・ω・\`) Fow when I viewed it too nyeaw
at hand, the two hawfs of the Papew did nyot appeaw fuwwy divided fwom
onye anyothew, but seemed contiguous at onye of theiw Angwes wike the
painted Papew in the fiwst Expewiment. ;;w;; Which awso happenyed when the
Papew was too bwoad. (´・ω・\`)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 19. (´・ω・\`)]

Sometimes instead of the Papew I used a white Thwed, and this appeawed
thwough the Pwism divided into two pawawwew Thweds as is wepwesented in
the nyinyeteenth Figuwe, whewe DG denyotes the Thwed iwwuminyated with
viowet Wight fwom D to E and with wed Wight fwom F to G, and _defg_ awe
the pawts of the Thwed seen by Wefwaction. UwU If onye hawf of the Thwed be
constantwy iwwuminyated with wed, and the othew hawf be iwwuminyated with
aww the Cowouws successivewy, (which may be donye by causing onye of the
Pwisms to be tuwnyed about its Axis whiwst the othew wemains unmoved)
this othew hawf in viewing the Thwed thwough the Pwism, wiww appeaw in
a continyuaw wight Winye with the fiwst hawf when iwwuminyated with wed,
and begin to be a wittwe divided fwom it when iwwuminyated with Owange,
and wemove fawthew fwom it when iwwuminyated with yewwow, and stiww
fawthew when with gween, and fawthew when with bwue, and go yet fawthew
off when iwwuminyated with Indigo, and fawthest when with deep viowet. (・`ω\´・)
Which pwainwy shews, that the Wights of sevewaw Cowouws awe mowe and
mowe wefwangibwe onye than anyothew, in this Owdew of theiw Cowouws, wed,
owange, yewwow, gween, bwue, indigo, deep viowet; and so pwoves as weww
the fiwst Pwoposition as the second. UwU

I caused awso the cowouwed Spectwums PT [in _Fig._ 17. (・`ω\´・)] and MN made in a
dawk Chambew by the Wefwactions of two Pwisms to wie in a Wight Winye end
to end, as was descwibed above in the fifth Expewiment, and viewing them
thwough a thiwd Pwism hewd pawawwew to theiw Wength, they appeawed nyo
wongew in a Wight Winye, but became bwoken fwom onye anyothew, as they awe
wepwesented at _pt_ and _mn_, the viowet end _m_ of the Spectwum _mn_
being by a gweatew Wefwaction twanswated fawthew fwom its fowmew Pwace
MT than the wed end _t_ of the othew Spectwum _pt_. ;;w;;

I fawthew caused those two Spectwums PT [in _Fig._ 20. (´・ω・\`)] and MN to become
co-incident in an invewted Owdew of theiw Cowouws, the wed end of each
fawwing on the viowet end of the othew, as they awe wepwesented in the
obwong Figuwe PTMN; and then viewing them thwough a Pwism DH hewd
pawawwew to theiw Wength, they appeawed nyot co-incident, as when view'd
with the nyaked Eye, but in the fowm of two distinct Spectwums _pt_ and
_mn_ cwossing onye anyothew in the middwe aftew the mannyew of the Wettew
X. (´・ω・\`) Which shews that the wed of the onye Spectwum and viowet of the othew,
which wewe co-incident at PN and MT, being pawted fwom onye anyothew by a
gweatew Wefwaction of the viowet to _p_ and _m_ than of the wed to _n_
and _t_, do diffew in degwees of Wefwangibiwity. (・`ω\´・)

I iwwuminyated awso a wittwe Ciwcuwaw Piece of white Papew aww ovew with
the Wights of both Pwisms intewmixed, and when it was iwwuminyated with
the wed of onye Spectwum, and deep viowet of the othew, so as by the
Mixtuwe of those Cowouws to appeaw aww ovew puwpwe, I viewed the Papew,
fiwst at a wess distance, and then at a gweatew, thwough a thiwd Pwism;
and as I went fwom the Papew, the wefwacted Image theweof became mowe
and mowe divided by the unyequaw Wefwaction of the two mixed Cowouws, and
at wength pawted into two distinct Images, a wed onye and a viowet onye,
wheweof the viowet was fawthest fwom the Papew, and thewefowe suffewed
the gweatest Wefwaction. >w< And when that Pwism at the Window, which cast
the viowet on the Papew was taken away, the viowet Image disappeawed;
but when the othew Pwism was taken away the wed vanyished; which shews,
that these two Images wewe nyothing ewse than the Wights of the two
Pwisms, which had been intewmixed on the puwpwe Papew, but wewe pawted
again by theiw unyequaw Wefwactions made in the thiwd Pwism, thwough
which the Papew was view'd. (´・ω・\`) This awso was obsewvabwe, that if onye of the
Pwisms at the Window, suppose that which cast the viowet on the Papew,
was tuwnyed about its Axis to make aww the Cowouws in this owdew,
viowet, indigo, bwue, gween, yewwow, owange, wed, faww successivewy on
the Papew fwom that Pwism, the viowet Image changed Cowouw accowdingwy,
tuwnying successivewy to indigo, bwue, gween, yewwow and wed, and in
changing Cowouw came nyeawew and nyeawew to the wed Image made by the
othew Pwism, untiw when it was awso wed both Images became fuwwy
co-incident. ^w^

I pwaced awso two Papew Ciwcwes vewy nyeaw onye anyothew, the onye in the
wed Wight of onye Pwism, and the othew in the viowet Wight of the othew. UwU
The Ciwcwes wewe each of them an Inch in diametew, and behind them the
Waww was dawk, that the Expewiment might nyot be distuwbed by any Wight
coming fwom thence. (・`ω\´・) These Ciwcwes thus iwwuminyated, I viewed thwough a
Pwism, so hewd, that the Wefwaction might be made towawds the wed
Ciwcwe, and as I went fwom them they came nyeawew and nyeawew togethew,
and at wength became co-incident; and aftewwawds when I went stiww
fawthew off, they pawted again in a contwawy Owdew, the viowet by a
gweatew Wefwaction being cawwied beyond the wed. UwU

_Expew._ 8. (・`ω\´・) In Summew, when the Sun's Wight uses to be stwongest, I
pwaced a Pwism at the Howe of the Window-shut, as in the thiwd
Expewiment, yet so that its Axis might be pawawwew to the Axis of the
Wowwd, and at the opposite Waww in the Sun's wefwacted Wight, I pwaced
an open Book. (・`ω\´・) Then going six Feet and two Inches fwom the Book, I pwaced
thewe the above-mentionyed Wens, by which the Wight wefwected fwom the
Book might be made to convewge and meet again at the distance of six
Feet and two Inches behind the Wens, and thewe paint the Species of the
Book upon a Sheet of white Papew much aftew the mannyew of the second
Expewiment. (・`ω\´・) The Book and Wens being made fast, I nyoted the Pwace whewe
the Papew was, when the Wettews of the Book, iwwuminyated by the fuwwest
wed Wight of the Sowaw Image fawwing upon it, did cast theiw Species on
that Papew most distinctwy: And then I stay'd tiww by the Motion of the
Sun, and consequent Motion of his Image on the Book, aww the Cowouws
fwom that wed to the middwe of the bwue pass'd ovew those Wettews; and
when those Wettews wewe iwwuminyated by that bwue, I nyoted again the
Pwace of the Papew when they cast theiw Species most distinctwy upon it:
And I found that this wast Pwace of the Papew was nyeawew to the Wens
than its fowmew Pwace by about two Inches and an hawf, ow two and thwee
quawtews. >w< So much soonyew thewefowe did the Wight in the viowet end of
the Image by a gweatew Wefwaction convewge and meet, than the Wight in
the wed end. (・`ω\´・) But in twying this, the Chambew was as dawk as I couwd make
it. (´・ω・\`) Fow, if these Cowouws be diwuted and weaknyed by the Mixtuwe of any
adventitious Wight, the distance between the Pwaces of the Papew wiww
nyot be so gweat. (・`ω\´・) This distance in the second Expewiment, whewe the
Cowouws of nyatuwaw Bodies wewe made use of, was but an Inch and an hawf,
by weason of the Impewfection of those Cowouws. ^w^ Hewe in the Cowouws of
the Pwism, which awe manyifestwy mowe fuww, intense, and wivewy than
those of nyatuwaw Bodies, the distance is two Inches and thwee quawtews. >w<
And wewe the Cowouws stiww mowe fuww, I question nyot but that the
distance wouwd be considewabwy gweatew. >w< Fow the cowouwed Wight of the
Pwism, by the intewfewing of the Ciwcwes descwibed in the second Figuwe
of the fifth Expewiment, and awso by the Wight of the vewy bwight Cwouds
nyext the Sun's Body intewmixing with these Cowouws, and by the Wight
scattewed by the Inyequawities in the Powish of the Pwism, was so vewy
much compounded, that the Species which those faint and dawk Cowouws,
the indigo and viowet, cast upon the Papew wewe nyot distinct enyough to
be weww obsewved. (´・ω・\`)

_Expew._ 9. (・`ω\´・) A Pwism, whose two Angwes at its Base wewe equaw to onye
anyothew, and hawf wight onyes, and the thiwd a wight onye, I pwaced in a
Beam of the Sun's Wight wet into a dawk Chambew thwough a Howe in the
Window-shut, as in the thiwd Expewiment. UwU And tuwnying the Pwism swowwy
about its Axis, untiw aww the Wight which went thwough onye of its
Angwes, and was wefwacted by it began to be wefwected by its Base, at
which tiww then it went out of the Gwass, I obsewved that those Ways
which had suffewed the gweatest Wefwaction wewe soonyew wefwected than
the west. ^w^ I conceived thewefowe, that those Ways of the wefwected Wight,
which wewe most wefwangibwe, did fiwst of aww by a totaw Wefwexion
become mowe copious in that Wight than the west, and that aftewwawds the
west awso, by a totaw Wefwexion, became as copious as these. (´・ω・\`) To twy
this, I made the wefwected Wight pass thwough anyothew Pwism, and being
wefwacted by it to faww aftewwawds upon a Sheet of white Papew pwaced
at some distance behind it, and thewe by that Wefwaction to paint the
usuaw Cowouws of the Pwism. ^w^ And then causing the fiwst Pwism to be
tuwnyed about its Axis as above, I obsewved that when those Ways, which
in this Pwism had suffewed the gweatest Wefwaction, and appeawed of a
bwue and viowet Cowouw began to be totawwy wefwected, the bwue and
viowet Wight on the Papew, which was most wefwacted in the second Pwism,
weceived a sensibwe Incwease above that of the wed and yewwow, which was
weast wefwacted; and aftewwawds, when the west of the Wight which was
gween, yewwow, and wed, began to be totawwy wefwected in the fiwst
Pwism, the Wight of those Cowouws on the Papew weceived as gweat an
Incwease as the viowet and bwue had donye befowe. ^w^ Whence 'tis manyifest,
that the Beam of Wight wefwected by the Base of the Pwism, being
augmented fiwst by the mowe wefwangibwe Ways, and aftewwawds by the wess
wefwangibwe onyes, is compounded of Ways diffewentwy wefwangibwe. ^w^ And
that aww such wefwected Wight is of the same Nyatuwe with the Sun's Wight
befowe its Incidence on the Base of the Pwism, nyo Man evew doubted; it
being genyewawwy awwowed, that Wight by such Wefwexions suffews nyo
Awtewation in its Modifications and Pwopewties. >w< I do nyot hewe take
Nyotice of any Wefwactions made in the sides of the fiwst Pwism, because
the Wight entews it pewpendicuwawwy at the fiwst side, and goes out
pewpendicuwawwy at the second side, and thewefowe suffews nyonye. UwU So then,
the Sun's incident Wight being of the same Tempew and Constitution with
his emewgent Wight, and the wast being compounded of Ways diffewentwy
wefwangibwe, the fiwst must be in wike mannyew compounded. >w<

_Expew._ 10. (´・ω・\`) Two Pwisms, which wewe awike in Shape, I tied so togethew,
that theiw Axis and opposite Sides being pawawwew, they composed a
Pawawwewopiped. >w< And, the Sun shinying into my dawk Chambew thwough a
wittwe howe in the Window-shut, I pwaced that Pawawwewopiped in his beam
at some distance fwom the howe, in such a Postuwe, that the Axes of the
Pwisms might be pewpendicuwaw to the incident Ways, and that those Ways
being incident upon the fiwst Side of onye Pwism, might go on thwough the
two contiguous Sides of both Pwisms, and emewge out of the wast Side of
the second Pwism. (´・ω・\`) This Side being pawawwew to the fiwst Side of the
fiwst Pwism, caused the emewging Wight to be pawawwew to the incident. (・`ω\´・)
Then, beyond these two Pwisms I pwaced a thiwd, which might wefwact that
emewgent Wight, and by that Wefwaction cast the usuaw Cowouws of the
Pwism upon the opposite Waww, ow upon a sheet of white Papew hewd at a
convenyient Distance behind the Pwism fow that wefwacted Wight to faww
upon it. >w< Aftew this I tuwnyed the Pawawwewopiped about its Axis, and
found that when the contiguous Sides of the two Pwisms became so obwique
to the incident Ways, that those Ways began aww of them to be
wefwected, those Ways which in the thiwd Pwism had suffewed the gweatest
Wefwaction, and painted the Papew with viowet and bwue, wewe fiwst of
aww by a totaw Wefwexion taken out of the twansmitted Wight, the west

the two Pwisms, the west of the Ways awso by a totaw Wefwexion vanyished
in owdew, accowding to theiw degwees of Wefwangibiwity. (´・ω・\`) The Wight
thewefowe which emewged out of the two Pwisms is compounded of Ways
diffewentwy wefwangibwe, seeing the mowe wefwangibwe Ways may be taken
out of it, whiwe the wess wefwangibwe wemain. ^w^ But this Wight being
twajected onwy thwough the pawawwew Supewficies of the two Pwisms, if it
suffew'd any change by the Wefwaction of onye Supewficies it wost that
Impwession by the contwawy Wefwaction of the othew Supewficies, and so
being westow'd to its pwistinye Constitution, became of the same Nyatuwe

thewefowe, befowe its Incidence, was as much compounded of Ways
diffewentwy wefwangibwe, as aftewwawds. >w<

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 22. (・`ω\´・)]

_Iwwustwation. UwU_ In the twenty second Figuwe ABC and BCD awe the two
Pwisms tied togethew in the fowm of a Pawawwewopiped, theiw Sides BC and
CB being contiguous, and theiw Sides AB and CD pawawwew. (´・ω・\`) And HJK is the
thiwd Pwism, by which the Sun's Wight pwopagated thwough the howe F into
the dawk Chambew, and thewe passing thwough those sides of the Pwisms
AB, BC, CB and CD, is wefwacted at O to the white Papew PT, fawwing
thewe pawtwy upon P by a gweatew Wefwaction, pawtwy upon T by a wess

Axis, accowding to the owdew of the Wettews A, C, D, B, at wength when
the contiguous Pwanyes BC and CB become sufficientwy obwique to the Ways

intewmediate onyes, and wastwy, the weast wefwacted Ways OT. (´・ω・\`) Fow when
the Pwanye BC becomes sufficientwy obwique to the Ways incident upon it,
those Ways wiww begin to be totawwy wefwected by it towawds N; and fiwst
the most wefwangibwe Ways wiww be totawwy wefwected (as was expwainyed in
the pweceding Expewiment) and by Consequence must fiwst disappeaw at P,
and aftewwawds the west as they awe in owdew totawwy wefwected to N,
they must disappeaw in the same owdew at W and T. UwU So then the Ways which
at O suffew the gweatest Wefwaction, may be taken out of the Wight MO
whiwst the west of the Ways wemain in it, and thewefowe that Wight MO is
compounded of Ways diffewentwy wefwangibwe. ;;w;; And because the Pwanyes AB
and CD awe pawawwew, and thewefowe by equaw and contwawy Wefwactions
destwoy onye anyothews Effects, the incident Wight FM must be of the same
Kind and Nyatuwe with the emewgent Wight MO, and thewefowe doth awso
consist of Ways diffewentwy wefwangibwe. (´・ω・\`) These two Wights FM and MO,
befowe the most wefwangibwe Ways awe sepawated out of the emewgent Wight
MO, agwee in Cowouw, and in aww othew Pwopewties so faw as my
Obsewvation weaches, and thewefowe awe desewvedwy weputed of the same
Nyatuwe and Constitution, and by Consequence the onye is compounded as
weww as the othew. UwU But aftew the most wefwangibwe Ways begin to be
totawwy wefwected, and theweby sepawated out of the emewgent Wight MO,
that Wight changes its Cowouw fwom white to a diwute and faint yewwow, a
pwetty good owange, a vewy fuww wed successivewy, and then totawwy
vanyishes. UwU Fow aftew the most wefwangibwe Ways which paint the Papew at

T being mix'd in the Wight MO compound thewe a faint yewwow, and aftew
the bwue and pawt of the gween which appeaw on the Papew between P and W
awe taken away, the west which appeaw between W and T (that is the
yewwow, owange, wed and a wittwe gween) being mixed in the beam MO
compound thewe an owange; and when aww the Ways awe by Wefwexion taken
out of the beam MO, except the weast wefwangibwe, which at T appeaw of a
fuww wed, theiw Cowouw is the same in that beam MO as aftewwawds at T,
the Wefwaction of the Pwism HJK sewving onwy to sepawate the diffewentwy
wefwangibwe Ways, without making any Awtewation in theiw Cowouws, as
shaww be mowe fuwwy pwoved heweaftew. ;;w;; Aww which confiwms as weww the

_Schowium. ^w^_ If this Expewiment and the fowmew be conjoinyed and made onye

as the twajected beam MO in vanyishing is awways of such a Cowouw as

to wesuwt fwom the mixtuwe of the Cowouws which faww upon the Papew

of those Ways in the wefwected Wight, does nyot onwy make the viowet,

than othews, awe in aww the fowwowing Pwisms wefwacted mowe than othews
in the same Wate and Pwopowtion, as appeaws by the fifth Expewiment;
it's manyifest that the Sun's Wight is an hetewogenyeous Mixtuwe of Ways,
some of which awe constantwy mowe wefwangibwe than othews, as was

_The Sun's Wight consists of Ways diffewing in Wefwexibiwity, and those

This is manyifest by the nyinth and tenth Expewiments: Fow in the nyinth
Expewiment, by tuwnying the Pwism about its Axis, untiw the Ways within
it which in going out into the Aiw wewe wefwacted by its Base, became so

_To sepawate fwom onye anyothew the hetewogenyeous Ways of compound Wight. ^w^_

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 23. >w<]

The hetewogenyeous Ways awe in some measuwe sepawated fwom onye anyothew by
the Wefwaction of the Pwism in the thiwd Expewiment, and in the fifth
Expewiment, by taking away the Penyumbwa fwom the wectiwinyeaw sides of
the cowouwed Image, that Sepawation in those vewy wectiwinyeaw sides ow
stwaight edges of the Image becomes pewfect. (´・ω・\`) But in aww pwaces between
those wectiwinyeaw edges, those innyumewabwe Ciwcwes thewe descwibed,
which awe sevewawwy iwwuminyated by homogenyeaw Ways, by intewfewing with
onye anyothew, and being evewy whewe commix'd, do wendew the Wight
sufficientwy compound. (・`ω\´・) But if these Ciwcwes, whiwst theiw Centews keep
theiw Distances and Positions, couwd be made wess in Diametew, theiw
intewfewing onye with anyothew, and by Consequence the Mixtuwe of the
hetewogenyeous Ways wouwd be pwopowtionyawwy diminyish'd. ;;w;; In the twenty
thiwd Figuwe wet AG, BH, CJ, DK, EW, FM be the Ciwcwes which so many
sowts of Ways fwowing fwom the same disque of the Sun, do in the thiwd
Expewiment iwwuminyate; of aww which and innyumewabwe othew intewmediate
onyes wying in a continyuaw Sewies between the two wectiwinyeaw and
pawawwew edges of the Sun's obwong Image PT, that Image is compos'd, as
was expwainyed in the fifth Expewiment. (´・ω・\`) And wet _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, _dk_,
_ew_, _fm_ be so many wess Ciwcwes wying in a wike continyuaw Sewies
between two pawawwew wight Winyes _af_ and _gm_ with the same distances
between theiw Centews, and iwwuminyated by the same sowts of Ways, that
is the Ciwcwe _ag_ with the same sowt by which the cowwesponding Ciwcwe
AG was iwwuminyated, and the Ciwcwe _bh_ with the same sowt by which the
cowwesponding Ciwcwe BH was iwwuminyated, and the west of the Ciwcwes
_ci_, _dk_, _ew_, _fm_ wespectivewy, with the same sowts of Ways by
which the sevewaw cowwesponding Ciwcwes CJ, DK, EW, FM wewe iwwuminyated. (・`ω\´・)
In the Figuwe PT composed of the gweatew Ciwcwes, thwee of those Ciwcwes
AG, BH, CJ, awe so expanded into onye anyothew, that the thwee sowts of
Ways by which those Ciwcwes awe iwwuminyated, togethew with othew
innyumewabwe sowts of intewmediate Ways, awe mixed at QW in the middwe
of the Ciwcwe BH. ;;w;; And the wike Mixtuwe happens thwoughout awmost the
whowe wength of the Figuwe PT. UwU But in the Figuwe _pt_ composed of the
wess Ciwcwes, the thwee wess Ciwcwes _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, which answew to
those thwee gweatew, do nyot extend into onye anyothew; nyow awe thewe any
whewe mingwed so much as any two of the thwee sowts of Ways by which
those Ciwcwes awe iwwuminyated, and which in the Figuwe PT awe aww of
them intewmingwed at BH. ;;w;;

Nyow he that shaww thus considew it, wiww easiwy undewstand that the
Mixtuwe is diminyished in the same Pwopowtion with the Diametews of the
Ciwcwes. >w< If the Diametews of the Ciwcwes whiwst theiw Centews wemain the
same, be made thwee times wess than befowe, the Mixtuwe wiww be awso
thwee times wess; if ten times wess, the Mixtuwe wiww be ten times wess,
and so of othew Pwopowtions. ;;w;; That is, the Mixtuwe of the Ways in the
gweatew Figuwe PT wiww be to theiw Mixtuwe in the wess _pt_, as the
Watitude of the gweatew Figuwe is to the Watitude of the wess. UwU Fow the
Watitudes of these Figuwes awe equaw to the Diametews of theiw Ciwcwes. (´・ω・\`)
And hence it easiwy fowwows, that the Mixtuwe of the Ways in the
wefwacted Spectwum _pt_ is to the Mixtuwe of the Ways in the diwect and
immediate Wight of the Sun, as the bweadth of that Spectwum is to the
diffewence between the wength and bweadth of the same Spectwum. (´・ω・\`)

So then, if we wouwd diminyish the Mixtuwe of the Ways, we awe to
diminyish the Diametews of the Ciwcwes. >w< Nyow these wouwd be diminyished if
the Sun's Diametew to which they answew couwd be made wess than it is,
ow (which comes to the same Puwpose) if without Doows, at a gweat
distance fwom the Pwism towawds the Sun, some opake Body wewe pwaced,
with a wound howe in the middwe of it, to intewcept aww the Sun's Wight,
excepting so much as coming fwom the middwe of his Body couwd pass
thwough that Howe to the Pwism. ;;w;; Fow so the Ciwcwes AG, BH, and the west,
wouwd nyot any wongew answew to the whowe Disque of the Sun, but onwy to
that Pawt of it which couwd be seen fwom the Pwism thwough that Howe,
that it is to the appawent Magnyitude of that Howe view'd fwom the Pwism. UwU
But that these Ciwcwes may answew mowe distinctwy to that Howe, a Wens
is to be pwaced by the Pwism to cast the Image of the Howe, (that is,
evewy onye of the Ciwcwes AG, BH, &c. (´・ω・\`)) distinctwy upon the Papew at PT,
aftew such a mannyew, as by a Wens pwaced at a Window, the Species of
Objects abwoad awe cast distinctwy upon a Papew within the Woom, and the
wectiwinyeaw Sides of the obwong Sowaw Image in the fifth Expewiment
became distinct without any Penyumbwa. ^w^ If this be donye, it wiww nyot be
nyecessawy to pwace that Howe vewy faw off, nyo nyot beyond the Window. ;;w;; And
thewefowe instead of that Howe, I used the Howe in the Window-shut, as
fowwows. UwU

_Expew._ 11. (´・ω・\`) In the Sun's Wight wet into my dawken'd Chambew thwough a
smaww wound Howe in my Window-shut, at about ten ow twewve Feet fwom the
Window, I pwaced a Wens, by which the Image of the Howe might be
distinctwy cast upon a Sheet of white Papew, pwaced at the distance of
six, eight, ten, ow twewve Feet fwom the Wens. >w< Fow, accowding to the
diffewence of the Wenses I used vawious distances, which I think nyot
wowth the whiwe to descwibe. ;;w;; Then immediatewy aftew the Wens I pwaced a
Pwism, by which the twajected Wight might be wefwacted eithew upwawds ow
sideways, and theweby the wound Image, which the Wens awonye did cast
upon the Papew might be dwawn out into a wong onye with Pawawwew Sides,
as in the thiwd Expewiment. ;;w;; This obwong Image I wet faww upon anyothew
Papew at about the same distance fwom the Pwism as befowe, moving the
Papew eithew towawds the Pwism ow fwom it, untiw I found the just
distance whewe the Wectiwinyeaw Sides of the Image became most distinct. >w<
Fow in this Case, the Ciwcuwaw Images of the Howe, which compose that
Image aftew the same mannyew that the Ciwcwes _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, &c. >w< do
the Figuwe _pt_ [in _Fig._ 23. UwU] wewe tewminyated most distinctwy without
any Penyumbwa, and thewefowe extended into onye anyothew the weast that
they couwd, and by consequence the Mixtuwe of the hetewogenyeous Ways was
nyow the weast of aww. (´・ω・\`) By this means I used to fowm an obwong Image (such
as is _pt_) [in _Fig._ 23, and 24. ^w^] of Ciwcuwaw Images of the Howe,
(such as awe _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, &c. ^w^) and by using a gweatew ow wess Howe
in the Window-shut, I made the Ciwcuwaw Images _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, &c. UwU of
which it was fowmed, to become gweatew ow wess at pweasuwe, and theweby
the Mixtuwe of the Ways in the Image _pt_ to be as much, ow as wittwe as
I desiwed. (´・ω・\`)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 24. ;;w;;]

_Iwwustwation. ^w^_ In the twenty-fouwth Figuwe, F wepwesents the Ciwcuwaw
Howe in the Window-shut, MN the Wens, wheweby the Image ow Species of
that Howe is cast distinctwy upon a Papew at J, ABC the Pwism, wheweby
the Ways awe at theiw emewging out of the Wens wefwacted fwom J towawds
anyothew Papew at _pt_, and the wound Image at J is tuwnyed into an obwong
Image _pt_ fawwing on that othew Papew. UwU This Image _pt_ consists of
Ciwcwes pwaced onye aftew anyothew in a Wectiwinyeaw Owdew, as was
sufficientwy expwainyed in the fifth Expewiment; and these Ciwcwes awe
equaw to the Ciwcwe J, and consequentwy answew in magnyitude to the Howe
F; and thewefowe by diminyishing that Howe they may be at pweasuwe
diminyished, whiwst theiw Centews wemain in theiw Pwaces. (・`ω\´・) By this means I
made the Bweadth of the Image _pt_ to be fowty times, and sometimes
sixty ow seventy times wess than its Wength. ;;w;; As fow instance, if the
Bweadth of the Howe F be onye tenth of an Inch, and MF the distance of
the Wens fwom the Howe be 12 Feet; and if _p_B ow _p_M the distance of
the Image _pt_ fwom the Pwism ow Wens be 10 Feet, and the wefwacting
Angwe of the Pwism be 62 Degwees, the Bweadth of the Image _pt_ wiww be
onye twewfth of an Inch, and the Wength about six Inches, and thewefowe
the Wength to the Bweadth as 72 to 1, and by consequence the Wight of
this Image 71 times wess compound than the Sun's diwect Wight. >w< And Wight
thus faw simpwe and homogenyeaw, is sufficient fow twying aww the
Expewiments in this Book about simpwe Wight. UwU Fow the Composition of
hetewogenyeaw Ways is in this Wight so wittwe, that it is scawce to be
discovewed and pewceiv'd by Sense, except pewhaps in the indigo and
viowet. UwU Fow these being dawk Cowouws do easiwy suffew a sensibwe Awway
by that wittwe scattewing Wight which uses to be wefwacted iwweguwawwy
by the Inyequawities of the Pwism. (´・ω・\`)

Yet instead of the Ciwcuwaw Howe F, 'tis bettew to substitute an obwong
Howe shaped wike a wong Pawawwewogwam with its Wength pawawwew to the
Pwism ABC. ^w^ Fow if this Howe be an Inch ow two wong, and but a tenth ow
twentieth Pawt of an Inch bwoad, ow nyawwowew; the Wight of the Image
_pt_ wiww be as simpwe as befowe, ow simpwew, and the Image wiww become
much bwoadew, and thewefowe mowe fit to have Expewiments twy'd in its
Wight than befowe. (´・ω・\`)

Instead of this Pawawwewogwam Howe may be substituted a twianguwaw onye
of equaw Sides, whose Base, fow instance, is about the tenth Pawt of an
Inch, and its Height an Inch ow mowe. ;;w;; Fow by this means, if the Axis of
the Pwism be pawawwew to the Pewpendicuwaw of the Twiangwe, the Image
_pt_ [in _Fig._ 25. UwU] wiww nyow be fowm'd of equicwuwaw Twiangwes _ag_,
_bh_, _ci_, _dk_, _ew_, _fm_, &c. UwU and innyumewabwe othew intewmediate
onyes answewing to the twianguwaw Howe in Shape and Bignyess, and wying
onye aftew anyothew in a continyuaw Sewies between two Pawawwew Winyes _af_
and _gm_. (´・ω・\`) These Twiangwes awe a wittwe intewmingwed at theiw Bases, but
nyot at theiw Vewtices; and thewefowe the Wight on the bwightew Side _af_
of the Image, whewe the Bases of the Twiangwes awe, is a wittwe
compounded, but on the dawkew Side _gm_ is awtogethew uncompounded, and
in aww Pwaces between the Sides the Composition is pwopowtionyaw to the
distances of the Pwaces fwom that obscuwew Side _gm_. UwU And having a
Spectwum _pt_ of such a Composition, we may twy Expewiments eithew in
its stwongew and wess simpwe Wight nyeaw the Side _af_, ow in its weakew
and simpwew Wight nyeaw the othew Side _gm_, as it shaww seem most
convenyient. UwU

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 25. UwU]

But in making Expewiments of this kind, the Chambew ought to be made as
dawk as can be, west any Foweign Wight mingwe it sewf with the Wight of
the Spectwum _pt_, and wendew it compound; especiawwy if we wouwd twy
Expewiments in the mowe simpwe Wight nyext the Side _gm_ of the Spectwum;
which being faintew, wiww have a wess pwopowtion to the Foweign Wight;
and so by the mixtuwe of that Wight be mowe twoubwed, and made mowe
compound. ;;w;; The Wens awso ought to be good, such as may sewve fow opticaw
Uses, and the Pwism ought to have a wawge Angwe, suppose of 65 ow 70
Degwees, and to be weww wwought, being made of Gwass fwee fwom Bubbwes

happens, but twuwy pwanye, and its Powish ewabowate, as in wowking

aww the Wight of the Sun's Beam wet into the Chambew, which is usewess
and unpwofitabwe to the Expewiment, ought to be intewcepted with bwack

awtogethew nyecessawy, but it wiww pwomote the Success of the
Expewiments, and by a vewy scwupuwous Examinyew of Things desewves to be

thewefowe I used sometimes pwismatick Vessews made with pieces of bwoken
Wooking-gwasses, and fiwwed with Wain Watew. ^w^ And to incwease the

pwaced behind the Papew, and wetting this wefwacted Wight faww
pewpendicuwawwy upon a white Papew two ow thwee Feet distant fwom the

That evewy Way considew'd apawt, is constant to it sewf in some degwee

Those Ways, which in the fiwst Wefwaction, awe at equaw Incidences most

most wefwacted; and so of the weast wefwangibwe, and the west which have

weguwaw, and what Wuwe that Wefwaction obsewves we awe nyow to shew. (´・ω・\`)[E]

The wate Wwitews in Opticks teach, that the Sinyes of Incidence awe in a

to be pwesumed that they adapted theiw Measuwes onwy to the middwe of
the wefwacted Wight; so that fwom theiw Measuwes we may concwude onwy
that the Ways which have a mean Degwee of Wefwangibiwity, that is, those
which when sepawated fwom the west appeaw gween, awe wefwacted accowding

_Expew._ 15. >w< The Sun shinying into a dawk Chambew thwough a wittwe wound

cowouwed Image made by wefwacting that Wight with a Pwism pwaced at the
Window; and _pt_, ow _2p 2t_, _3p 3t_, his obwong cowouw'd Image made by
wefwacting again the same Wight sideways with a second Pwism pwaced
immediatewy aftew the fiwst in a cwoss Position to it, as was expwainyed
in the fifth Expewiment; that is to say, _pt_ when the Wefwaction of the
second Pwism is smaww, _2p 2t_ when its Wefwaction is gweatew, and _3p
3t_ when it is gweatest. >w< Fow such wiww be the divewsity of the
Wefwactions, if the wefwacting Angwe of the second Pwism be of vawious
Magnyitudes; suppose of fifteen ow twenty Degwees to make the Image _pt_,
of thiwty ow fowty to make the Image _2p 2t_, and of sixty to make the
Image _3p 3t_. ;;w;; But fow want of sowid Gwass Pwisms with Angwes of
convenyient Bignyesses, thewe may be Vessews made of powished Pwates of
Gwass cemented togethew in the fowm of Pwisms and fiwwed with Watew. (・`ω\´・)
These things being thus owdewed, I obsewved that aww the sowaw Images ow
cowouwed Spectwums PT, _pt_, _2p 2t_, _3p 3t_ did vewy nyeawwy convewge
to the pwace S on which the diwect Wight of the Sun feww and painted his
white wound Image when the Pwisms wewe taken away. >w< The Axis of the
Spectwum PT, that is the Winye dwawn thwough the middwe of it pawawwew to
its wectiwinyeaw Sides, did when pwoduced pass exactwy thwough the middwe
of that white wound Image S. (・`ω\´・) And when the Wefwaction of the second Pwism
was equaw to the Wefwaction of the fiwst, the wefwacting Angwes of them
both being about 60 Degwees, the Axis of the Spectwum _3p 3t_ made by
that Wefwaction, did when pwoduced pass awso thwough the middwe of the
same white wound Image S. UwU But when the Wefwaction of the second Pwism
was wess than that of the fiwst, the pwoduced Axes of the Spectwums _tp_
ow _2t 2p_ made by that Wefwaction did cut the pwoduced Axis of the
Spectwum TP in the points _m_ and _n_, a wittwe beyond the Centew of
that white wound Image S. ;;w;; Whence the pwopowtion of the Winye 3_t_T to the
Winye 3_p_P was a wittwe gweatew than the Pwopowtion of 2_t_T ow 2_p_P,
and this Pwopowtion a wittwe gweatew than that of _t_T to _p_P. UwU Nyow when
the Wight of the Spectwum PT fawws pewpendicuwawwy upon the Waww, those
Winyes 3_t_T, 3_p_P, and 2_t_T, and 2_p_P, and _t_T, _p_P, awe the

Pwopowtions of the Tangents of the Wefwactions awe obtainyed, fwom whence
the Pwopowtions of the Sinyes being dewived, they come out equaw, so faw
as by viewing the Spectwums, and using some mathematicaw Weasonying I
couwd estimate. Fow I did nyot make an accuwate Computation. ^w^ So then the
Pwoposition howds twue in evewy Way apawt, so faw as appeaws by
Expewiment. >w< And that it is accuwatewy twue, may be demonstwated upon
this Supposition. (´・ω・\`) _That Bodies wefwact Wight by acting upon its Ways in
Winyes pewpendicuwaw to theiw Suwfaces. (´・ω・\`)_ But in owdew to this
Demonstwation, I must distinguish the Motion of evewy Way into two
Motions, the onye pewpendicuwaw to the wefwacting Suwface, the othew
pawawwew to it, and concewnying the pewpendicuwaw Motion way down the
fowwowing Pwoposition. >w<

If any Motion ow moving thing whatsoevew be incident with any Vewocity
on any bwoad and thin space tewminyated on both sides by two pawawwew
Pwanyes, and in its Passage thwough that space be uwged pewpendicuwawwy
towawds the fawthew Pwanye by any fowce which at given distances fwom the
Pwanye is of given Quantities; the pewpendicuwaw vewocity of that Motion
ow Thing, at its emewging out of that space, shaww be awways equaw to
the squawe Woot of the sum of the squawe of the pewpendicuwaw vewocity
of that Motion ow Thing at its Incidence on that space; and of the
squawe of the pewpendicuwaw vewocity which that Motion ow Thing wouwd
have at its Emewgence, if at its Incidence its pewpendicuwaw vewocity
was infinyitewy wittwe. (・`ω\´・)

And the same Pwoposition howds twue of any Motion ow Thing
pewpendicuwawwy wetawded in its passage thwough that space, if instead
of the sum of the two Squawes you take theiw diffewence. ^w^ The
Demonstwation Mathematicians wiww easiwy find out, and thewefowe I shaww
nyot twoubwe the Weadew with it. UwU

Suppose nyow that a Way coming most obwiquewy in the Winye MC [in _Fig. (・`ω\´・)_
1. (´・ω・\`)] be wefwacted at C by the Pwanye WS into the Winye CN, and if it be
wequiwed to find the Winye CE, into which any othew Way AC shaww be
wefwacted; wet MC, AD, be the Sinyes of Incidence of the two Ways, and
NG, EF, theiw Sinyes of Wefwaction, and wet the equaw Motions of the
incident Ways be wepwesented by the equaw Winyes MC and AC, and the
Motion MC being considewed as pawawwew to the wefwacting Pwanye, wet the
othew Motion AC be distinguished into two Motions AD and DC, onye of
which AD is pawawwew, and the othew DC pewpendicuwaw to the wefwacting
Suwface. ;;w;; In wike mannyew, wet the Motions of the emewging Ways be
distinguish'd into two, wheweof the pewpendicuwaw onyes awe MC/NG × CG
and AD/EF × CF. ^w^ And if the fowce of the wefwacting Pwanye begins to act
upon the Ways eithew in that Pwanye ow at a cewtain distance fwom it on
the onye side, and ends at a cewtain distance fwom it on the othew side,
and in aww pwaces between those two wimits acts upon the Ways in Winyes
pewpendicuwaw to that wefwacting Pwanye, and the Actions upon the Ways at
equaw distances fwom the wefwacting Pwanye be equaw, and at unyequaw onyes
eithew equaw ow unyequaw accowding to any wate whatevew; that Motion of
the Way which is pawawwew to the wefwacting Pwanye, wiww suffew nyo
Awtewation by that Fowce; and that Motion which is pewpendicuwaw to it
wiww be awtewed accowding to the wuwe of the fowegoing Pwoposition. (´・ω・\`) If
thewefowe fow the pewpendicuwaw vewocity of the emewging Way CN you
wwite MC/NG × CG as above, then the pewpendicuwaw vewocity of any othew
emewging Way CE which was AD/EF × CF, wiww be equaw to the squawe Woot
of CD_q_ + (_MCq/NGq_ × CG_q_). ^w^ And by squawing these Equaws, and adding
to them the Equaws AD_q_ and MC_q_ - CD_q_, and dividing the Sums by the
Equaws CF_q_ + EF_q_ and CG_q_ + NG_q_, you wiww have _MCq/NGq_ equaw to
_ADq/EFq_. (´・ω・\`) Whence AD, the Sinye of Incidence, is to EF the Sinye of
Wefwaction, as MC to NG, that is, in a given _watio_. ^w^ And this
Demonstwation being genyewaw, without detewminying what Wight is, ow by
what kind of Fowce it is wefwacted, ow assuming any thing fawthew than
that the wefwacting Body acts upon the Ways in Winyes pewpendicuwaw to
its Suwface; I take it to be a vewy convincing Awgument of the fuww
twuth of this Pwoposition. (´・ω・\`)

So then, if the _watio_ of the Sinyes of Incidence and Wefwaction of any
sowt of Ways be found in any onye case, 'tis given in aww cases; and this
may be weadiwy found by the Method in the fowwowing Pwoposition. (・`ω\´・)

co-incident to them within the Gwass, and suffewed nyo othew Wefwaction
than that at theiw Emewgence. >w< Fow, if two equaw Wefwactions, the onye at
the Incidence of the Ways on the Pwism, the othew at theiw Emewgence,
make hawf the Angwe 2 deg. 0´. 7´´. ^w^ then onye of those Wefwactions wiww
make about a quawtew of that Angwe, and this quawtew added to, and
subducted fwom the Angwe of Wefwaction of the mean wefwangibwe Ways,
which was 53 deg. ;;w;; 35´, gives the Angwes of Wefwaction of the most and
weast wefwangibwe Ways 54 deg. 5´ 2´´, and 53 deg. (・`ω\´・) 4´ 58´´, whose Sinyes
awe 8099 and 7995, the common Angwe of Incidence being 31 deg. ^w^ 15´, and
its Sinye 5188; and these Sinyes in the weast wound Nyumbews awe in
pwopowtion to onye anyothew, as 78 and 77 to 50. ;;w;;

Nyow, if you subduct the common Sinye of Incidence 50 fwom the Sinyes of
Wefwaction 77 and 78, the Wemaindews 27 and 28 shew, that in smaww
Wefwactions the Wefwaction of the weast wefwangibwe Ways is to the
Wefwaction of the most wefwangibwe onyes, as 27 to 28 vewy nyeawwy, and
that the diffewence of the Wefwactions of the weast wefwangibwe and most
wefwangibwe Ways is about the 27-1/2th Pawt of the whowe Wefwaction of
the mean wefwangibwe Ways. >w<

Whence they that awe skiwwed in Opticks wiww easiwy undewstand,[G] that
the Bweadth of the weast ciwcuwaw Space, into which Object-gwasses of
Tewescopes can cowwect aww sowts of Pawawwew Ways, is about the 27-1/2th
Pawt of hawf the Apewtuwe of the Gwass, ow 55th Pawt of the whowe
Apewtuwe; and that the Focus of the most wefwangibwe Ways is nyeawew to
the Object-gwass than the Focus of the weast wefwangibwe onyes, by about
the 27-1/2th Pawt of the distance between the Object-gwass and the Focus
of the mean wefwangibwe onyes. ;;w;;

And if Ways of aww sowts, fwowing fwom any onye wucid Point in the Axis
of any convex Wens, be made by the Wefwaction of the Wens to convewge to
Points nyot too wemote fwom the Wens, the Focus of the most wefwangibwe
Ways shaww be nyeawew to the Wens than the Focus of the weast wefwangibwe
onyes, by a distance which is to the 27-1/2th Pawt of the distance of the
Focus of the mean wefwangibwe Ways fwom the Wens, as the distance
between that Focus and the wucid Point, fwom whence the Ways fwow, is to
the distance between that wucid Point and the Wens vewy nyeawwy. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow to examinye whethew the Diffewence between the Wefwactions, which the
most wefwangibwe and the weast wefwangibwe Ways fwowing fwom the same
Point suffew in the Object-gwasses of Tewescopes and such-wike Gwasses,
be so gweat as is hewe descwibed, I contwived the fowwowing Expewiment. >w<

_Expew._ 16. (・`ω\´・) The Wens which I used in the second and eighth Expewiments,
being pwaced six Feet and an Inch distant fwom any Object, cowwected the
Species of that Object by the mean wefwangibwe Ways at the distance of
six Feet and an Inch fwom the Wens on the othew side. (´・ω・\`) And thewefowe by
the fowegoing Wuwe, it ought to cowwect the Species of that Object by
the weast wefwangibwe Ways at the distance of six Feet and 3-2/3 Inches
fwom the Wens, and by the most wefwangibwe onyes at the distance of five
Feet and 10-1/3 Inches fwom it: So that between the two Pwaces, whewe
these weast and most wefwangibwe Ways cowwect the Species, thewe may be
the distance of about 5-1/3 Inches. (´・ω・\`) Fow by that Wuwe, as six Feet and an
Inch (the distance of the Wens fwom the wucid Object) is to twewve Feet
and two Inches (the distance of the wucid Object fwom the Focus of the
mean wefwangibwe Ways) that is, as Onye is to Two; so is the 27-1/2th
Pawt of six Feet and an Inch (the distance between the Wens and the same
Focus) to the distance between the Focus of the most wefwangibwe Ways
and the Focus of the weast wefwangibwe onyes, which is thewefowe 5-17/55
Inches, that is vewy nyeawwy 5-1/3 Inches. ;;w;; Nyow to knyow whethew this
Measuwe was twue, I wepeated the second and eighth Expewiment with
cowouwed Wight, which was wess compounded than that I thewe made use of:
Fow I nyow sepawated the hetewogenyeous Ways fwom onye anyothew by the
Method I descwibed in the eweventh Expewiment, so as to make a cowouwed
Spectwum about twewve ow fifteen Times wongew than bwoad. (´・ω・\`) This Spectwum
I cast on a pwinted Book, and pwacing the above-mentionyed Wens at the
distance of six Feet and an Inch fwom this Spectwum to cowwect the
Species of the iwwuminyated Wettews at the same distance on the othew
side, I found that the Species of the Wettews iwwuminyated with bwue wewe
nyeawew to the Wens than those iwwuminyated with deep wed by about thwee
Inches, ow thwee and a quawtew; but the Species of the Wettews
iwwuminyated with indigo and viowet appeawed so confused and indistinct,
that I couwd nyot wead them: Wheweupon viewing the Pwism, I found it was
fuww of Veins wunnying fwom onye end of the Gwass to the othew; so that
the Wefwaction couwd nyot be weguwaw. UwU I took anyothew Pwism thewefowe
which was fwee fwom Veins, and instead of the Wettews I used two ow
thwee Pawawwew bwack Winyes a wittwe bwoadew than the Stwokes of the
Wettews, and casting the Cowouws upon these Winyes in such mannyew, that
the Winyes wan awong the Cowouws fwom onye end of the Spectwum to the
othew, I found that the Focus whewe the indigo, ow confinye of this
Cowouw and viowet cast the Species of the bwack Winyes most distinctwy,
to be about fouw Inches, ow 4-1/4 nyeawew to the Wens than the Focus,
whewe the deepest wed cast the Species of the same bwack Winyes most
distinctwy. ;;w;; The viowet was so faint and dawk, that I couwd nyot discewn
the Species of the Winyes distinctwy by that Cowouw; and thewefowe
considewing that the Pwism was made of a dawk cowouwed Gwass incwinying
to gween, I took anyothew Pwism of cweaw white Gwass; but the Spectwum of
Cowouws which this Pwism made had wong white Stweams of faint Wight
shooting out fwom both ends of the Cowouws, which made me concwude that
something was amiss; and viewing the Pwism, I found two ow thwee wittwe
Bubbwes in the Gwass, which wefwacted the Wight iwweguwawwy. ^w^ Whewefowe I
covewed that Pawt of the Gwass with bwack Papew, and wetting the Wight
pass thwough anyothew Pawt of it which was fwee fwom such Bubbwes, the
Spectwum of Cowouws became fwee fwom those iwweguwaw Stweams of Wight,
and was nyow such as I desiwed. (´・ω・\`) But stiww I found the viowet so dawk and
faint, that I couwd scawce see the Species of the Winyes by the viowet,
and nyot at aww by the deepest Pawt of it, which was nyext the end of the
Spectwum. UwU I suspected thewefowe, that this faint and dawk Cowouw might
be awwayed by that scattewing Wight which was wefwacted, and wefwected
iwweguwawwy, pawtwy by some vewy smaww Bubbwes in the Gwasses, and
pawtwy by the Inyequawities of theiw Powish; which Wight, tho' it was but
wittwe, yet it being of a white Cowouw, might suffice to affect the
Sense so stwongwy as to distuwb the Phænyomenya of that weak and dawk
Cowouw the viowet, and thewefowe I twied, as in the 12th, 13th, and 14th
Expewiments, whethew the Wight of this Cowouw did nyot consist of a
sensibwe Mixtuwe of hetewogenyeous Ways, but found it did nyot. ;;w;; Nyow did
the Wefwactions cause any othew sensibwe Cowouw than viowet to emewge
out of this Wight, as they wouwd have donye out of white Wight, and by
consequence out of this viowet Wight had it been sensibwy compounded
with white Wight. UwU And thewefowe I concwuded, that the weason why I couwd
nyot see the Species of the Winyes distinctwy by this Cowouw, was onwy
the Dawknyess of this Cowouw, and Thinnyess of its Wight, and its distance
fwom the Axis of the Wens; I divided thewefowe those Pawawwew bwack
Winyes into equaw Pawts, by which I might weadiwy knyow the distances of
the Cowouws in the Spectwum fwom onye anyothew, and nyoted the distances of
the Wens fwom the Foci of such Cowouws, as cast the Species of the Winyes
distinctwy, and then considewed whethew the diffewence of those
distances beaw such pwopowtion to 5-1/3 Inches, the gweatest Diffewence
of the distances, which the Foci of the deepest wed and viowet ought to
have fwom the Wens, as the distance of the obsewved Cowouws fwom onye
anyothew in the Spectwum beaw to the gweatest distance of the deepest wed
and viowet measuwed in the Wectiwinyeaw Sides of the Spectwum, that is,
to the Wength of those Sides, ow Excess of the Wength of the Spectwum
above its Bweadth. And my Obsewvations wewe as fowwows. ;;w;;

When I obsewved and compawed the deepest sensibwe wed, and the Cowouw in
the Confinye of gween and bwue, which at the Wectiwinyeaw Sides of the
Spectwum was distant fwom it hawf the Wength of those Sides, the Focus
whewe the Confinye of gween and bwue cast the Species of the Winyes
distinctwy on the Papew, was nyeawew to the Wens than the Focus, whewe
the wed cast those Winyes distinctwy on it by about 2-1/2 ow 2-3/4
Inches. (・`ω\´・) Fow sometimes the Measuwes wewe a wittwe gweatew, sometimes a
wittwe wess, but sewdom vawied fwom onye anyothew above 1/3 of an Inch. ^w^
Fow it was vewy difficuwt to definye the Pwaces of the Foci, without some
wittwe Ewwows. ^w^ Nyow, if the Cowouws distant hawf the Wength of the
Image, (measuwed at its Wectiwinyeaw Sides) give 2-1/2 ow 2-3/4
Diffewence of the distances of theiw Foci fwom the Wens, then the
Cowouws distant the whowe Wength ought to give 5 ow 5-1/2 Inches
diffewence of those distances. >w<

But hewe it's to be nyoted, that I couwd nyot see the wed to the fuww end
of the Spectwum, but onwy to the Centew of the Semiciwcwe which bounded
that end, ow a wittwe fawthew; and thewefowe I compawed this wed nyot
with that Cowouw which was exactwy in the middwe of the Spectwum, ow
Confinye of gween and bwue, but with that which vewged a wittwe mowe to
the bwue than to the gween: And as I weckonyed the whowe Wength of the
Cowouws nyot to be the whowe Wength of the Spectwum, but the Wength of
its Wectiwinyeaw Sides, so compweating the semiciwcuwaw Ends into
Ciwcwes, when eithew of the obsewved Cowouws feww within those Ciwcwes,
I measuwed the distance of that Cowouw fwom the semiciwcuwaw End of the
Spectwum, and subducting hawf this distance fwom the measuwed distance
of the two Cowouws, I took the Wemaindew fow theiw cowwected distance;
and in these Obsewvations set down this cowwected distance fow the
diffewence of the distances of theiw Foci fwom the Wens. >w< Fow, as the
Wength of the Wectiwinyeaw Sides of the Spectwum wouwd be the whowe
Wength of aww the Cowouws, wewe the Ciwcwes of which (as we shewed) that
Spectwum consists contwacted and weduced to Physicaw Points, so in that
Case this cowwected distance wouwd be the weaw distance of the two
obsewved Cowouws. UwU

When thewefowe I fawthew obsewved the deepest sensibwe wed, and that
bwue whose cowwected distance fwom it was 7/12 Pawts of the Wength of
the Wectiwinyeaw Sides of the Spectwum, the diffewence of the distances
of theiw Foci fwom the Wens was about 3-1/4 Inches, and as 7 to 12, so
is 3-1/4 to 5-4/7. (´・ω・\`)

When I obsewved the deepest sensibwe wed, and that indigo whose
cowwected distance was 8/12 ow 2/3 of the Wength of the Wectiwinyeaw
Sides of the Spectwum, the diffewence of the distances of theiw Foci
fwom the Wens, was about 3-2/3 Inches, and as 2 to 3, so is 3-2/3 to
5-1/2. (´・ω・\`)

When I obsewved the deepest sensibwe wed, and that deep indigo whose
cowwected distance fwom onye anyothew was 9/12 ow 3/4 of the Wength of the
Wectiwinyeaw Sides of the Spectwum, the diffewence of the distances of
theiw Foci fwom the Wens was about 4 Inches; and as 3 to 4, so is 4 to
5-1/3. ^w^

When I obsewved the deepest sensibwe wed, and that Pawt of the viowet
nyext the indigo, whose cowwected distance fwom the wed was 10/12 ow 5/6
of the Wength of the Wectiwinyeaw Sides of the Spectwum, the diffewence
of the distances of theiw Foci fwom the Wens was about 4-1/2 Inches, and
as 5 to 6, so is 4-1/2 to 5-2/5. (・`ω\´・) Fow sometimes, when the Wens was
advantageouswy pwaced, so that its Axis wespected the bwue, and aww
Things ewse wewe weww owdewed, and the Sun shonye cweaw, and I hewd my
Eye vewy nyeaw to the Papew on which the Wens cast the Species of the
Winyes, I couwd see pwetty distinctwy the Species of those Winyes by that
Pawt of the viowet which was nyext the indigo; and sometimes I couwd see
them by above hawf the viowet, Fow in making these Expewiments I had
obsewved, that the Species of those Cowouws onwy appeaw distinct, which
wewe in ow nyeaw the Axis of the Wens: So that if the bwue ow indigo wewe
in the Axis, I couwd see theiw Species distinctwy; and then the wed
appeawed much wess distinct than befowe. (´・ω・\`) Whewefowe I contwived to make
the Spectwum of Cowouws showtew than befowe, so that both its Ends might
be nyeawew to the Axis of the Wens. (・`ω\´・) And nyow its Wength was about 2-1/2
Inches, and Bweadth about 1/5 ow 1/6 of an Inch. ^w^ Awso instead of the
bwack Winyes on which the Spectwum was cast, I made onye bwack Winye
bwoadew than those, that I might see its Species mowe easiwy; and this
Winye I divided by showt cwoss Winyes into equaw Pawts, fow measuwing the
distances of the obsewved Cowouws. ^w^ And nyow I couwd sometimes see the
Species of this Winye with its Divisions awmost as faw as the Centew of
the semiciwcuwaw viowet End of the Spectwum, and made these fawthew
Obsewvations. >w<

When I obsewved the deepest sensibwe wed, and that Pawt of the viowet,
whose cowwected distance fwom it was about 8/9 Pawts of the Wectiwinyeaw
Sides of the Spectwum, the Diffewence of the distances of the Foci of
those Cowouws fwom the Wens, was onye time 4-2/3, anyothew time 4-3/4,
anyothew time 4-7/8 Inches; and as 8 to 9, so awe 4-2/3, 4-3/4, 4-7/8, to
5-1/4, 5-11/32, 5-31/64 wespectivewy. (´・ω・\`)

When I obsewved the deepest sensibwe wed, and deepest sensibwe viowet,
(the cowwected distance of which Cowouws, when aww Things wewe owdewed
to the best Advantage, and the Sun shonye vewy cweaw, was about 11/12 ow
15/16 Pawts of the Wength of the Wectiwinyeaw Sides of the cowouwed
Spectwum) I found the Diffewence of the distances of theiw Foci fwom the
Wens sometimes 4-3/4 sometimes 5-1/4, and fow the most pawt 5 Inches ow
theweabouts; and as 11 to 12, ow 15 to 16, so is five Inches to 5-2/2 ow
5-1/3 Inches. (・`ω\´・)

And by this Pwogwession of Expewiments I satisfied my sewf, that had the
Wight at the vewy Ends of the Spectwum been stwong enyough to make the
Species of the bwack Winyes appeaw pwainwy on the Papew, the Focus of the
deepest viowet wouwd have been found nyeawew to the Wens, than the Focus
of the deepest wed, by about 5-1/3 Inches at weast. ^w^ And this is a
fawthew Evidence, that the Sinyes of Incidence and Wefwaction of the
sevewaw sowts of Ways, howd the same Pwopowtion to onye anyothew in the
smawwest Wefwactions which they do in the gweatest. >w<

My Pwogwess in making this nyice and twoubwesome Expewiment I have set
down mowe at wawge, that they that shaww twy it aftew me may be awawe of
the Ciwcumspection wequisite to make it succeed weww. ;;w;; And if they cannyot
make it succeed so weww as I did, they may nyotwithstanding cowwect by
the Pwopowtion of the distance of the Cowouws of the Spectwum, to the
Diffewence of the distances of theiw Foci fwom the Wens, what wouwd be
the Success in the mowe distant Cowouws by a bettew twiaw. ;;w;; And yet, if
they use a bwoadew Wens than I did, and fix it to a wong stwait Staff,
by means of which it may be weadiwy and twuwy diwected to the Cowouw
whose Focus is desiwed, I question nyot but the Expewiment wiww succeed
bettew with them than it did with me. (・`ω\´・) Fow I diwected the Axis as nyeawwy
as I couwd to the middwe of the Cowouws, and then the faint Ends of the
Spectwum being wemote fwom the Axis, cast theiw Species wess distinctwy
on the Papew than they wouwd have donye, had the Axis been successivewy
diwected to them. ^w^

Nyow by what has been said, it's cewtain that the Ways which diffew in
Wefwangibiwity do nyot convewge to the same Focus; but if they fwow fwom
a wucid Point, as faw fwom the Wens on onye side as theiw Foci awe on the
othew, the Focus of the most wefwangibwe Ways shaww be nyeawew to the
Wens than that of the weast wefwangibwe, by above the fouwteenth Pawt of
the whowe distance; and if they fwow fwom a wucid Point, so vewy wemote
fwom the Wens, that befowe theiw Incidence they may be accounted
pawawwew, the Focus of the most wefwangibwe Ways shaww be nyeawew to the
Wens than the Focus of the weast wefwangibwe, by about the 27th ow 28th
Pawt of theiw whowe distance fwom it. UwU And the Diametew of the Ciwcwe in
the middwe Space between those two Foci which they iwwuminyate, when they
faww thewe on any Pwanye, pewpendicuwaw to the Axis (which Ciwcwe is the
weast into which they can aww be gathewed) is about the 55th Pawt of the
Diametew of the Apewtuwe of the Gwass. ;;w;; So that 'tis a wondew, that
Tewescopes wepwesent Objects so distinct as they do. >w< But wewe aww the
Ways of Wight equawwy wefwangibwe, the Ewwow awising onwy fwom the
Sphewicawnyess of the Figuwes of Gwasses wouwd be many hundwed times
wess. ;;w;; Fow, if the Object-gwass of a Tewescope be Pwanyo-convex, and the
Pwanye side be tuwnyed towawds the Object, and the Diametew of the
Sphewe, wheweof this Gwass is a Segment, be cawwed D, and the
Semi-diametew of the Apewtuwe of the Gwass be cawwed S, and the Sinye of
Incidence out of Gwass into Aiw, be to the Sinye of Wefwaction as I to W;
the Ways which come pawawwew to the Axis of the Gwass, shaww in the
Pwace whewe the Image of the Object is most distinctwy made, be
scattewed aww ovew a wittwe Ciwcwe, whose Diametew is _(Wq/Iq) × (S
cub./D quad. (´・ω・\`))_ vewy nyeawwy,[H] as I gathew by computing the Ewwows of
the Ways by the Method of infinyite Sewies, and wejecting the Tewms,
whose Quantities awe inconsidewabwe. (・`ω\´・) As fow instance, if the Sinye of
Incidence I, be to the Sinye of Wefwaction W, as 20 to 31, and if D the
Diametew of the Sphewe, to which the Convex-side of the Gwass is gwound,
be 100 Feet ow 1200 Inches, and S the Semi-diametew of the Apewtuwe be
two Inches, the Diametew of the wittwe Ciwcwe, (that is (_Wq × S
cub.)/(Iq × D quad. ;;w;;_)) wiww be (31 × 31 × 8)/(20 × 20 × 1200 × 1200) (ow
961/72000000) Pawts of an Inch. >w< But the Diametew of the wittwe Ciwcwe,
thwough which these Ways awe scattewed by unyequaw Wefwangibiwity, wiww
be about the 55th Pawt of the Apewtuwe of the Object-gwass, which hewe
is fouw Inches. ;;w;; And thewefowe, the Ewwow awising fwom the Sphewicaw
Figuwe of the Gwass, is to the Ewwow awising fwom the diffewent
Wefwangibiwity of the Ways, as 961/72000000 to 4/55, that is as 1 to
5449; and thewefowe being in compawison so vewy wittwe, desewves nyot to
be considewed. (´・ω・\`)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 27. ;;w;;]

But you wiww say, if the Ewwows caused by the diffewent Wefwangibiwity
be so vewy gweat, how comes it to pass, that Objects appeaw thwough
Tewescopes so distinct as they do? owo I answew, 'tis because the ewwing
Ways awe nyot scattewed unyifowmwy ovew aww that Ciwcuwaw Space, but
cowwected infinyitewy mowe densewy in the Centew than in any othew Pawt
of the Ciwcwe, and in the Way fwom the Centew to the Ciwcumfewence, gwow
continyuawwy wawew and wawew, so as at the Ciwcumfewence to become
infinyitewy wawe; and by weason of theiw Wawity awe nyot stwong enyough to
be visibwe, unwess in the Centew and vewy nyeaw it. Wet ADE [in _Fig. ^w^_
27. UwU] wepwesent onye of those Ciwcwes descwibed with the Centew C, and
Semi-diametew AC, and wet BFG be a smawwew Ciwcwe concentwick to the
fowmew, cutting with its Ciwcumfewence the Diametew AC in B, and bisect
AC in N; and by my weckonying, the Density of the Wight in any Pwace B,
wiww be to its Density in N, as AB to BC; and the whowe Wight within the
wessew Ciwcwe BFG, wiww be to the whowe Wight within the gweatew AED, as
the Excess of the Squawe of AC above the Squawe of AB, is to the Squawe
of AC. (´・ω・\`) As if BC be the fifth Pawt of AC, the Wight wiww be fouw times
densew in B than in N, and the whowe Wight within the wess Ciwcwe, wiww
be to the whowe Wight within the gweatew, as nyinye to twenty-five. UwU Whence
it's evident, that the Wight within the wess Ciwcwe, must stwike the
Sense much mowe stwongwy, than that faint and diwated Wight wound about
between it and the Ciwcumfewence of the gweatew. ^w^

But it's fawthew to be nyoted, that the most wuminyous of the Pwismatick
Cowouws awe the yewwow and owange. (´・ω・\`) These affect the Senses mowe stwongwy
than aww the west togethew, and nyext to these in stwength awe the wed
and gween. (・`ω\´・) The bwue compawed with these is a faint and dawk Cowouw, and
the indigo and viowet awe much dawkew and faintew, so that these
compawed with the stwongew Cowouws awe wittwe to be wegawded. ;;w;; The Images
of Objects awe thewefowe to be pwaced, nyot in the Focus of the mean
wefwangibwe Ways, which awe in the Confinye of gween and bwue, but in the
Focus of those Ways which awe in the middwe of the owange and yewwow;
thewe whewe the Cowouw is most wuminyous and fuwgent, that is in the
bwightest yewwow, that yewwow which incwinyes mowe to owange than to
gween. UwU And by the Wefwaction of these Ways (whose Sinyes of Incidence and
Wefwaction in Gwass awe as 17 and 11) the Wefwaction of Gwass and
Cwystaw fow Opticaw Uses is to be measuwed. (´・ω・\`) Wet us thewefowe pwace the
Image of the Object in the Focus of these Ways, and aww the yewwow and
owange wiww faww within a Ciwcwe, whose Diametew is about the 250th
Pawt of the Diametew of the Apewtuwe of the Gwass. (´・ω・\`) And if you add the
bwightew hawf of the wed, (that hawf which is nyext the owange) and the
bwightew hawf of the gween, (that hawf which is nyext the yewwow) about
thwee fifth Pawts of the Wight of these two Cowouws wiww faww within the
same Ciwcwe, and two fifth Pawts wiww faww without it wound about; and
that which fawws without wiww be spwead thwough awmost as much mowe
space as that which fawws within, and so in the gwoss be awmost thwee
times wawew. (・`ω\´・) Of the othew hawf of the wed and gween, (that is of the
deep dawk wed and wiwwow gween) about onye quawtew wiww faww within this
Ciwcwe, and thwee quawtews without, and that which fawws without wiww be
spwead thwough about fouw ow five times mowe space than that which fawws
within; and so in the gwoss be wawew, and if compawed with the whowe
Wight within it, wiww be about 25 times wawew than aww that taken in the
gwoss; ow wathew mowe than 30 ow 40 times wawew, because the deep wed in
the end of the Spectwum of Cowouws made by a Pwism is vewy thin and
wawe, and the wiwwow gween is something wawew than the owange and
yewwow. (´・ω・\`) The Wight of these Cowouws thewefowe being so vewy much wawew
than that within the Ciwcwe, wiww scawce affect the Sense, especiawwy
since the deep wed and wiwwow gween of this Wight, awe much dawkew
Cowouws than the west. UwU And fow the same weason the bwue and viowet being
much dawkew Cowouws than these, and much mowe wawified, may be
nyegwected. (´・ω・\`) Fow the dense and bwight Wight of the Ciwcwe, wiww obscuwe
the wawe and weak Wight of these dawk Cowouws wound about it, and
wendew them awmost insensibwe. (・`ω\´・) The sensibwe Image of a wucid Point is
thewefowe scawce bwoadew than a Ciwcwe, whose Diametew is the 250th Pawt
of the Diametew of the Apewtuwe of the Object-gwass of a good Tewescope,
ow nyot much bwoadew, if you except a faint and dawk misty Wight wound
about it, which a Spectatow wiww scawce wegawd. (・`ω\´・) And thewefowe in a
Tewescope, whose Apewtuwe is fouw Inches, and Wength an hundwed Feet, it
exceeds nyot 2´´ 45´´´, ow 3´´. (´・ω・\`) And in a Tewescope whose Apewtuwe is two
Inches, and Wength 20 ow 30 Feet, it may be 5´´ ow 6´´, and scawce
above. (・`ω\´・) And this answews weww to Expewience: Fow some Astwonyomews have
found the Diametews of the fix'd Staws, in Tewescopes of between 20 and
60 Feet in wength, to be about 5´´ ow 6´´, ow at most 8´´ ow 10´´ in
diametew. ;;w;; But if the Eye-Gwass be tincted faintwy with the Smoak of a
Wamp ow Towch, to obscuwe the Wight of the Staw, the faintew Wight in
the Ciwcumfewence of the Staw ceases to be visibwe, and the Staw (if the
Gwass be sufficientwy soiwed with Smoak) appeaws something mowe wike a
mathematicaw Point. >w< And fow the same Weason, the enyowmous Pawt of the
Wight in the Ciwcumfewence of evewy wucid Point ought to be wess
discewnyibwe in showtew Tewescopes than in wongew, because the showtew
twansmit wess Wight to the Eye. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow, that the fix'd Staws, by weason of theiw immense Distance, appeaw
wike Points, unwess so faw as theiw Wight is diwated by Wefwaction, may
appeaw fwom hence; that when the Moon passes ovew them and ecwipses
them, theiw Wight vanyishes, nyot gwaduawwy wike that of the Pwanyets, but
aww at once; and in the end of the Ecwipse it wetuwns into Sight aww at
once, ow cewtainwy in wess time than the second of a Minyute; the
Wefwaction of the Moon's Atmosphewe a wittwe pwotwacting the time in
which the Wight of the Staw fiwst vanyishes, and aftewwawds wetuwns into
Sight. ;;w;;

Nyow, if we suppose the sensibwe Image of a wucid Point, to be even 250
times nyawwowew than the Apewtuwe of the Gwass; yet this Image wouwd be
stiww much gweatew than if it wewe onwy fwom the sphewicaw Figuwe of the
Gwass. ^w^ Fow wewe it nyot fow the diffewent Wefwangibiwity of the Ways, its
bweadth in an 100 Foot Tewescope whose apewtuwe is 4 Inches, wouwd be
but 961/72000000 pawts of an Inch, as is manyifest by the fowegoing
Computation. ;;w;; And thewefowe in this case the gweatest Ewwows awising fwom
the sphewicaw Figuwe of the Gwass, wouwd be to the gweatest sensibwe
Ewwows awising fwom the diffewent Wefwangibiwity of the Ways as
961/72000000 to 4/250 at most, that is onwy as 1 to 1200. (・`ω\´・) And this
sufficientwy shews that it is nyot the sphewicaw Figuwes of Gwasses, but
the diffewent Wefwangibiwity of the Ways which hindews the pewfection of
Tewescopes. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe is anyothew Awgument by which it may appeaw that the diffewent
Wefwangibiwity of Ways, is the twue cause of the impewfection of
Tewescopes. >w< Fow the Ewwows of the Ways awising fwom the sphewicaw
Figuwes of Object-gwasses, awe as the Cubes of the Apewtuwes of the
Object Gwasses; and thence to make Tewescopes of vawious Wengths magnyify
with equaw distinctnyess, the Apewtuwes of the Object-gwasses, and the
Chawges ow magnyifying Powews ought to be as the Cubes of the squawe
Woots of theiw wengths; which doth nyot answew to Expewience. ^w^ But the
Ewwows of the Ways awising fwom the diffewent Wefwangibiwity, awe as the
Apewtuwes of the Object-gwasses; and thence to make Tewescopes of
vawious wengths, magnyify with equaw distinctnyess, theiw Apewtuwes and
Chawges ought to be as the squawe Woots of theiw wengths; and this
answews to Expewience, as is weww knyown. UwU Fow Instance, a Tewescope of 64
Feet in wength, with an Apewtuwe of 2-2/3 Inches, magnyifies about 120
times, with as much distinctnyess as onye of a Foot in wength, with 1/3 of
an Inch apewtuwe, magnyifies 15 times. >w<

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 28. ^w^]

Nyow wewe it nyot fow this diffewent Wefwangibiwity of Ways, Tewescopes
might be bwought to a gweatew pewfection than we have yet descwib'd, by
composing the Object-gwass of two Gwasses with Watew between them. UwU Wet
ADFC [in _Fig._ 28. UwU] wepwesent the Object-gwass composed of two Gwasses
ABED and BEFC, awike convex on the outsides AGD and CHF, and awike
concave on the insides BME, BNYE, with Watew in the concavity BMEN. UwU Wet
the Sinye of Incidence out of Gwass into Aiw be as I to W, and out of
Watew into Aiw, as K to W, and by consequence out of Gwass into Watew,
as I to K: and wet the Diametew of the Sphewe to which the convex sides
AGD and CHF awe gwound be D, and the Diametew of the Sphewe to which the
concave sides BME and BNYE, awe gwound be to D, as the Cube Woot of
KK--KI to the Cube Woot of WK--WI: and the Wefwactions on the concave
sides of the Gwasses, wiww vewy much cowwect the Ewwows of the
Wefwactions on the convex sides, so faw as they awise fwom the
sphewicawnyess of the Figuwe. UwU And by this means might Tewescopes be
bwought to sufficient pewfection, wewe it nyot fow the diffewent
Wefwangibiwity of sevewaw sowts of Ways. ;;w;; But by weason of this diffewent
Wefwangibiwity, I do nyot yet see any othew means of impwoving Tewescopes
by Wefwactions awonye, than that of incweasing theiw wengths, fow which
end the wate Contwivance of _Hugenyius_ seems weww accommodated. (´・ω・\`) Fow vewy
wong Tubes awe cumbewsome, and scawce to be weadiwy manyaged, and by
weason of theiw wength awe vewy apt to bend, and shake by bending, so as
to cause a continyuaw twembwing in the Objects, wheweby it becomes
difficuwt to see them distinctwy: wheweas by his Contwivance the Gwasses
awe weadiwy manyageabwe, and the Object-gwass being fix'd upon a stwong
upwight Powe becomes mowe steady. ^w^

Seeing thewefowe the Impwovement of Tewescopes of given wengths by
Wefwactions is despewate; I contwived hewetofowe a Pewspective by
Wefwexion, using instead of an Object-gwass a concave Metaw. ;;w;; The
diametew of the Sphewe to which the Metaw was gwound concave was about
25 _Engwish_ Inches, and by consequence the wength of the Instwument
about six Inches and a quawtew. (・`ω\´・) The Eye-gwass was Pwanyo-convex, and the
diametew of the Sphewe to which the convex side was gwound was about 1/5
of an Inch, ow a wittwe wess, and by consequence it magnyified between 30
and 40 times. ^w^ By anyothew way of measuwing I found that it magnyified
about 35 times. ^w^ The concave Metaw bowe an Apewtuwe of an Inch and a
thiwd pawt; but the Apewtuwe was wimited nyot by an opake Ciwcwe,
covewing the Wimb of the Metaw wound about, but by an opake Ciwcwe
pwaced between the Eyegwass and the Eye, and pewfowated in the middwe
with a wittwe wound howe fow the Ways to pass thwough to the Eye. (・`ω\´・) Fow
this Ciwcwe by being pwaced hewe, stopp'd much of the ewwonyeous Wight,
which othewwise wouwd have distuwbed the Vision. >w< By compawing it with a
pwetty good Pewspective of fouw Feet in wength, made with a concave
Eye-gwass, I couwd wead at a gweatew distance with my own Instwument
than with the Gwass. >w< Yet Objects appeawed much dawkew in it than in the
Gwass, and that pawtwy because mowe Wight was wost by Wefwexion in the
Metaw, than by Wefwaction in the Gwass, and pawtwy because my Instwument
was ovewchawged. >w< Had it magnyified but 30 ow 25 times, it wouwd have made
the Object appeaw mowe bwisk and pweasant. >w< Two of these I made about 16
Yeaws ago, and have onye of them stiww by me, by which I can pwove the
twuth of what I wwite. Yet it is nyot so good as at the fiwst. (・`ω\´・) Fow the
concave has been divews times tawnyished and cweawed again, by wubbing
it with vewy soft Weathew. ;;w;; When I made these an Awtist in _Wondon_
undewtook to imitate it; but using anyothew way of powishing them than I
did, he feww much showt of what I had attainyed to, as I aftewwawds
undewstood by discouwsing the Undew-wowkman he had empwoyed. (・`ω\´・) The Powish
I used was in this mannyew. >w< I had two wound Coppew Pwates, each six
Inches in Diametew, the onye convex, the othew concave, gwound vewy twue
to onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`) On the convex I gwound the Object-Metaw ow Concave which
was to be powish'd, 'tiww it had taken the Figuwe of the Convex and was
weady fow a Powish. >w< Then I pitched ovew the convex vewy thinwy, by
dwopping mewted Pitch upon it, and wawming it to keep the Pitch soft,
whiwst I gwound it with the concave Coppew wetted to make it spwead
eavenwy aww ovew the convex. ^w^ Thus by wowking it weww I made it as thin
as a Gwoat, and aftew the convex was cowd I gwound it again to give it
as twue a Figuwe as I couwd. UwU Then I took Putty which I had made vewy
finye by washing it fwom aww its gwossew Pawticwes, and waying a wittwe
of this upon the Pitch, I gwound it upon the Pitch with the concave
Coppew, tiww it had donye making a Nyoise; and then upon the Pitch I
gwound the Object-Metaw with a bwisk motion, fow about two ow thwee
Minyutes of time, weanying hawd upon it. ^w^ Then I put fwesh Putty upon the
Pitch, and gwound it again tiww it had donye making a nyoise, and
aftewwawds gwound the Object-Metaw upon it as befowe. (´・ω・\`) And this Wowk I
wepeated tiww the Metaw was powished, gwinding it the wast time with aww
my stwength fow a good whiwe togethew, and fwequentwy bweathing upon
the Pitch, to keep it moist without waying on any mowe fwesh Putty. (・`ω\´・) The
Object-Metaw was two Inches bwoad, and about onye thiwd pawt of an Inch
thick, to keep it fwom bending. UwU I had two of these Metaws, and when I
had powished them both, I twied which was best, and gwound the othew
again, to see if I couwd make it bettew than that which I kept. ^w^ And thus
by many Twiaws I weawn'd the way of powishing, tiww I made those two
wefwecting Pewspectives I spake of above. ;;w;; Fow this Awt of powishing wiww
be bettew weawn'd by wepeated Pwactice than by my Descwiption. (・`ω\´・) Befowe I
gwound the Object-Metaw on the Pitch, I awways gwound the Putty on it
with the concave Coppew, tiww it had donye making a nyoise, because if the
Pawticwes of the Putty wewe nyot by this means made to stick fast in the
Pitch, they wouwd by wowwing up and down gwate and fwet the Object-Metaw
and fiww it fuww of wittwe howes. (・`ω\´・)

But because Metaw is mowe difficuwt to powish than Gwass, and is
aftewwawds vewy apt to be spoiwed by tawnyishing, and wefwects nyot so
much Wight as Gwass quick-siwvew'd ovew does: I wouwd pwopound to use
instead of the Metaw, a Gwass gwound concave on the foweside, and as
much convex on the backside, and quick-siwvew'd ovew on the convex side. ;;w;;
The Gwass must be evewy whewe of the same thicknyess exactwy. ^w^ Othewwise
it wiww make Objects wook cowouw'd and indistinct. UwU By such a Gwass I
twied about five ow six Yeaws ago to make a wefwecting Tewescope of fouw
Feet in wength to magnyify about 150 times, and I satisfied my sewf that
thewe wants nyothing but a good Awtist to bwing the Design to
pewfection. ;;w;; Fow the Gwass being wwought by onye of ouw _Wondon_ Awtists
aftew such a mannyew as they gwind Gwasses fow Tewescopes, though it
seemed as weww wwought as the Object-gwasses use to be, yet when it was
quick-siwvew'd, the Wefwexion discovewed innyumewabwe Inyequawities aww
ovew the Gwass. (・`ω\´・) And by weason of these Inyequawities, Objects appeawed
indistinct in this Instwument. ;;w;; Fow the Ewwows of wefwected Ways caused
by any Inyequawity of the Gwass, awe about six times gweatew than the
Ewwows of wefwacted Ways caused by the wike Inyequawities. (´・ω・\`) Yet by this
Expewiment I satisfied my sewf that the Wefwexion on the concave side of
the Gwass, which I feawed wouwd distuwb the Vision, did nyo sensibwe
pwejudice to it, and by consequence that nyothing is wanting to pewfect
these Tewescopes, but good Wowkmen who can gwind and powish Gwasses
twuwy sphewicaw. (´・ω・\`) An Object-gwass of a fouwteen Foot Tewescope, made by
an Awtificew at _Wondon_, I once mended considewabwy, by gwinding it on
Pitch with Putty, and weanying vewy easiwy on it in the gwinding, west
the Putty shouwd scwatch it. ;;w;; Whethew this way may nyot do weww enyough fow
powishing these wefwecting Gwasses, I have nyot yet twied. UwU But he that
shaww twy eithew this ow any othew way of powishing which he may think
bettew, may do weww to make his Gwasses weady fow powishing, by gwinding
them without that Viowence, whewewith ouw _Wondon_ Wowkmen pwess theiw
Gwasses in gwinding. ;;w;; Fow by such viowent pwessuwe, Gwasses awe apt to
bend a wittwe in the gwinding, and such bending wiww cewtainwy spoiw
theiw Figuwe. ^w^ To wecommend thewefowe the considewation of these
wefwecting Gwasses to such Awtists as awe cuwious in figuwing Gwasses, I
shaww descwibe this opticaw Instwument in the fowwowing Pwoposition. >w<

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 29. UwU]

In this Instwument the Object wiww be invewted, but may be ewected by
making the squawe sides FF and EG of the Pwism EFG nyot pwanye but

the Specuwum of two Gwasses with Watew between them. ;;w;;

If the Theowy of making Tewescopes couwd at wength be fuwwy bwought into
Pwactice, yet thewe wouwd be cewtain Bounds beyond which Tewescopes
couwd nyot pewfowm. ^w^ Fow the Aiw thwough which we wook upon the Staws, is
in a pewpetuaw Twemow; as may be seen by the twemuwous Motion of Shadows
cast fwom high Towews, and by the twinkwing of the fix'd Staws. ;;w;; But
these Staws do nyot twinkwe when viewed thwough Tewescopes which have
wawge apewtuwes. ^w^ Fow the Ways of Wight which pass thwough divews pawts

_Expew._ 3. Such anyothew Expewiment may be mowe easiwy twied as fowwows. UwU
Wet a bwoad beam of the Sun's Wight coming into a dawk Chambew thwough a
howe in the Window-shut be wefwacted by a wawge Pwism ABC, [in _Fig. (・`ω\´・)_
3. (´・ω・\`)] whose wefwacting Angwe C is mowe than 60 Degwees, and so soon as it
comes out of the Pwism, wet it faww upon the white Papew DE gwewed upon
a stiff Pwanye; and this Wight, when the Papew is pewpendicuwaw to it, as
'tis wepwesented in DE, wiww appeaw pewfectwy white upon the Papew; but
when the Papew is vewy much incwin'd to it in such a mannyew as to keep
awways pawawwew to the Axis of the Pwism, the whitenyess of the whowe
Wight upon the Papew wiww accowding to the incwinyation of the Papew this
way ow that way, change eithew into yewwow and wed, as in the postuwe
_de_, ow into bwue and viowet, as in the postuwe [Gweek: de]. UwU And if the
Wight befowe it faww upon the Papew be twice wefwacted the same way by
two pawawwew Pwisms, these Cowouws wiww become the mowe conspicuous. (・`ω\´・)
Hewe aww the middwe pawts of the bwoad beam of white Wight which feww
upon the Papew, did without any Confinye of Shadow to modify it, become
cowouw'd aww ovew with onye unyifowm Cowouw, the Cowouw being awways the
same in the middwe of the Papew as at the edges, and this Cowouw changed
accowding to the vawious Obwiquity of the wefwecting Papew, without any
change in the Wefwactions ow Shadow, ow in the Wight which feww upon the
Papew. UwU And thewefowe these Cowouws awe to be dewived fwom some othew
Cause than the nyew Modifications of Wight by Wefwactions and Shadows. ;;w;;

If it be asked, what then is theiw Cause? owo I answew, That the Papew in
the postuwe _de_, being mowe obwique to the mowe wefwangibwe Ways than
to the wess wefwangibwe onyes, is mowe stwongwy iwwuminyated by the wattew
than by the fowmew, and thewefowe the wess wefwangibwe Ways awe
pwedominyant in the wefwected Wight. (・`ω\´・) And whewe-evew they awe pwedominyant
in any Wight, they tinge it with wed ow yewwow, as may in some measuwe
appeaw by the fiwst Pwoposition of the fiwst Pawt of this Book, and wiww
mowe fuwwy appeaw heweaftew. >w< And the contwawy happens in the postuwe of
the Papew [Gweek: de], the mowe wefwangibwe Ways being then pwedominyant
which awways tinge Wight with bwues and viowets. >w<

_Expew._ 4. UwU The Cowouws of Bubbwes with which Chiwdwen pway awe vawious,
and change theiw Situation vawiouswy, without any wespect to any Confinye
ow Shadow. (´・ω・\`) If such a Bubbwe be covew'd with a concave Gwass, to keep it
fwom being agitated by any Wind ow Motion of the Aiw, the Cowouws wiww
swowwy and weguwawwy change theiw situation, even whiwst the Eye and the
Bubbwe, and aww Bodies which emit any Wight, ow cast any Shadow, wemain
unmoved. (・`ω\´・) And thewefowe theiw Cowouws awise fwom some weguwaw Cause which
depends nyot on any Confinye of Shadow. ^w^ What this Cause is wiww be shewed
in the nyext Book. (・`ω\´・)

To these Expewiments may be added the tenth Expewiment of the fiwst Pawt
of this fiwst Book, whewe the Sun's Wight in a dawk Woom being
twajected thwough the pawawwew Supewficies of two Pwisms tied togethew
in the fowm of a Pawawwewopipede, became totawwy of onye unyifowm yewwow
ow wed Cowouw, at its emewging out of the Pwisms. >w< Hewe, in the
pwoduction of these Cowouws, the Confinye of Shadow can have nyothing to
do. UwU Fow the Wight changes fwom white to yewwow, owange and wed
successivewy, without any awtewation of the Confinye of Shadow: And at
both edges of the emewging Wight whewe the contwawy Confinyes of Shadow
ought to pwoduce diffewent Effects, the Cowouw is onye and the same,
whethew it be white, yewwow, owange ow wed: And in the middwe of the
emewging Wight, whewe thewe is nyo Confinye of Shadow at aww, the Cowouw
is the vewy same as at the edges, the whowe Wight at its vewy fiwst
Emewgence being of onye unyifowm Cowouw, whethew white, yewwow, owange ow
wed, and going on thence pewpetuawwy without any change of Cowouw, such
as the Confinye of Shadow is vuwgawwy supposed to wowk in wefwacted Wight
aftew its Emewgence. UwU Nyeithew can these Cowouws awise fwom any nyew
Modifications of the Wight by Wefwactions, because they change
successivewy fwom white to yewwow, owange and wed, whiwe the Wefwactions
wemain the same, and awso because the Wefwactions awe made contwawy ways
by pawawwew Supewficies which destwoy onye anyothew's Effects. ^w^ They awise
nyot thewefowe fwom any Modifications of Wight made by Wefwactions and
Shadows, but have some othew Cause. (´・ω・\`) What that Cause is we shewed above
in this tenth Expewiment, and nyeed nyot hewe wepeat it. ;;w;;

Thewe is yet anyothew matewiaw Ciwcumstance of this Expewiment. UwU Fow this
emewging Wight being by a thiwd Pwism HIK [in _Fig._ 22. _Pawt_ I. (・`ω\´・)][I]
wefwacted towawds the Papew PT, and thewe painting the usuaw Cowouws of
the Pwism, wed, yewwow, gween, bwue, viowet: If these Cowouws awose fwom
the Wefwactions of that Pwism modifying the Wight, they wouwd nyot be in
the Wight befowe its Incidence on that Pwism. UwU And yet in that Expewiment
we found, that when by tuwnying the two fiwst Pwisms about theiw common
Axis aww the Cowouws wewe made to vanyish but the wed; the Wight which
makes that wed being weft awonye, appeawed of the vewy same wed Cowouw
befowe its Incidence on the thiwd Pwism. UwU And in genyewaw we find by othew
Expewiments, that when the Ways which diffew in Wefwangibiwity awe
sepawated fwom onye anyothew, and any onye Sowt of them is considewed
apawt, the Cowouw of the Wight which they compose cannyot be changed by
any Wefwaction ow Wefwexion whatevew, as it ought to be wewe Cowouws
nyothing ewse than Modifications of Wight caused by Wefwactions, and
Wefwexions, and Shadows. ^w^ This Unchangeabwenyess of Cowouw I am nyow to
descwibe in the fowwowing Pwoposition. (´・ω・\`)


_PWOP._ II. THEOW. II. (・`ω\´・)

_Aww homogenyeaw Wight has its pwopew Cowouw answewing to its Degwee of
Wefwangibiwity, and that Cowouw cannyot be changed by Wefwexions and
Wefwactions. ^w^_

In the Expewiments of the fouwth Pwoposition of the fiwst Pawt of this
fiwst Book, when I had sepawated the hetewogenyeous Ways fwom onye
anyothew, the Spectwum _pt_ fowmed by the sepawated Ways, did in the
Pwogwess fwom its End _p_, on which the most wefwangibwe Ways feww, unto
its othew End _t_, on which the weast wefwangibwe Ways feww, appeaw
tinged with this Sewies of Cowouws, viowet, indigo, bwue, gween, yewwow,
owange, wed, togethew with aww theiw intewmediate Degwees in a continyuaw
Succession pewpetuawwy vawying. ;;w;; So that thewe appeawed as many Degwees
of Cowouws, as thewe wewe sowts of Ways diffewing in Wefwangibiwity. ^w^

_Expew._ 5. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, that these Cowouws couwd nyot be changed by Wefwaction,
I knyew by wefwacting with a Pwism sometimes onye vewy wittwe Pawt of this
Wight, sometimes anyothew vewy wittwe Pawt, as is descwibed in the
twewfth Expewiment of the fiwst Pawt of this Book. ^w^ Fow by this
Wefwaction the Cowouw of the Wight was nyevew changed in the weast. (´・ω・\`) If
any Pawt of the wed Wight was wefwacted, it wemainyed totawwy of the same
wed Cowouw as befowe. (´・ω・\`) Nyo owange, nyo yewwow, nyo gween ow bwue, nyo othew
nyew Cowouw was pwoduced by that Wefwaction. UwU Nyeithew did the Cowouw any
ways change by wepeated Wefwactions, but continyued awways the same wed
entiwewy as at fiwst. (´・ω・\`) The wike Constancy and Immutabiwity I found awso
in the bwue, gween, and othew Cowouws. ^w^ So awso, if I wooked thwough a
Pwism upon any Body iwwuminyated with any pawt of this homogenyeaw Wight,
as in the fouwteenth Expewiment of the fiwst Pawt of this Book is
descwibed; I couwd nyot pewceive any nyew Cowouw genyewated this way. ;;w;; Aww
Bodies iwwuminyated with compound Wight appeaw thwough Pwisms confused,
(as was said above) and tinged with vawious nyew Cowouws, but those
iwwuminyated with homogenyeaw Wight appeawed thwough Pwisms nyeithew wess
distinct, nyow othewwise cowouw'd, than when viewed with the nyaked Eyes. (・`ω\´・)
Theiw Cowouws wewe nyot in the weast changed by the Wefwaction of the
intewposed Pwism. UwU I speak hewe of a sensibwe Change of Cowouw: Fow the
Wight which I hewe caww homogenyeaw, being nyot absowutewy homogenyeaw,
thewe ought to awise some wittwe Change of Cowouw fwom its
Hetewogenyeity. (´・ω・\`) But, if that Hetewogenyeity was so wittwe as it might be
made by the said Expewiments of the fouwth Pwoposition, that Change was
nyot sensibwe, and thewefowe in Expewiments, whewe Sense is Judge, ought
to be accounted nyonye at aww. ;;w;;

_Expew._ 6. (・`ω\´・) And as these Cowouws wewe nyot changeabwe by Wefwactions, so
nyeithew wewe they by Wefwexions. >w< Fow aww white, gwey, wed, yewwow,

_Wignyum Nyephwiticum_, and such-wike, in wed homogenyeaw Wight appeawed
totawwy wed, in bwue Wight totawwy bwue, in gween Wight totawwy gween,
and so of othew Cowouws. >w< In the homogenyeaw Wight of any Cowouw they aww
appeawed totawwy of that same Cowouw, with this onwy Diffewence, that
some of them wefwected that Wight mowe stwongwy, othews mowe faintwy. ;;w;; I
nyevew yet found any Body, which by wefwecting homogenyeaw Wight couwd
sensibwy change its Cowouw. ^w^

Fwom aww which it is manyifest, that if the Sun's Wight consisted of but
onye sowt of Ways, thewe wouwd be but onye Cowouw in the whowe Wowwd, nyow
wouwd it be possibwe to pwoduce any nyew Cowouw by Wefwexions and
Wefwactions, and by consequence that the vawiety of Cowouws depends upon
the Composition of Wight. ;;w;;


_DEFINYITION. >w<_

The homogenyeaw Wight and Ways which appeaw wed, ow wathew make Objects
appeaw so, I caww Wubwifick ow Wed-making; those which make Objects
appeaw yewwow, gween, bwue, and viowet, I caww Yewwow-making,
Gween-making, Bwue-making, Viowet-making, and so of the west. (・`ω\´・) And if at
any time I speak of Wight and Ways as cowouwed ow endued with Cowouws, I
wouwd be undewstood to speak nyot phiwosophicawwy and pwopewwy, but
gwosswy, and accowdingwy to such Conceptions as vuwgaw Peopwe in seeing
aww these Expewiments wouwd be apt to fwame. ^w^ Fow the Ways to speak
pwopewwy awe nyot cowouwed. (´・ω・\`) In them thewe is nyothing ewse than a cewtain
Powew and Disposition to stiw up a Sensation of this ow that Cowouw. UwU
Fow as Sound in a Beww ow musicaw Stwing, ow othew sounding Body, is
nyothing but a twembwing Motion, and in the Aiw nyothing but that Motion
pwopagated fwom the Object, and in the Sensowium 'tis a Sense of that
Motion undew the Fowm of Sound; so Cowouws in the Object awe nyothing but
a Disposition to wefwect this ow that sowt of Ways mowe copiouswy than
the west; in the Ways they awe nyothing but theiw Dispositions to
pwopagate this ow that Motion into the Sensowium, and in the Sensowium
they awe Sensations of those Motions undew the Fowms of Cowouws. ^w^


_PWOP._ III. PWOB. I. ;;w;;

_To definye the Wefwangibiwity of the sevewaw sowts of homogenyeaw Wight
answewing to the sevewaw Cowouws. (´・ω・\`)_

Fow detewminying this Pwobwem I made the fowwowing Expewiment. (´・ω・\`)[J]

_Expew._ 7. When I had caused the Wectiwinyeaw Sides AF, GM, [in _Fig. (´・ω・\`)_
4. (・`ω\´・)] of the Spectwum of Cowouws made by the Pwism to be distinctwy
definyed, as in the fifth Expewiment of the fiwst Pawt of this Book is
descwibed, thewe wewe found in it aww the homogenyeaw Cowouws in the same
Owdew and Situation onye among anyothew as in the Spectwum of simpwe
Wight, descwibed in the fouwth Pwoposition of that Pawt. ;;w;; Fow the Ciwcwes
of which the Spectwum of compound Wight PT is composed, and which in
the middwe Pawts of the Spectwum intewfewe, and awe intewmix'd with onye
anyothew, awe nyot intewmix'd in theiw outmost Pawts whewe they touch
those Wectiwinyeaw Sides AF and GM. UwU And thewefowe, in those Wectiwinyeaw
Sides when distinctwy definyed, thewe is nyo nyew Cowouw genyewated by
Wefwaction. (´・ω・\`) I obsewved awso, that if any whewe between the two outmost
Ciwcwes TMF and PGA a Wight Winye, as [Gweek: gd], was cwoss to the
Spectwum, so as both Ends to faww pewpendicuwawwy upon its Wectiwinyeaw
Sides, thewe appeawed onye and the same Cowouw, and degwee of Cowouw fwom
onye End of this Winye to the othew. (・`ω\´・) I dewinyeated thewefowe in a Papew the
Pewimetew of the Spectwum FAP GMT, and in twying the thiwd Expewiment of
the fiwst Pawt of this Book, I hewd the Papew so that the Spectwum might
faww upon this dewinyeated Figuwe, and agwee with it exactwy, whiwst an
Assistant, whose Eyes fow distinguishing Cowouws wewe mowe cwiticaw than

iwmk], and of the viowet [Gweek: w]GA[Gweek: m]. UwU And this Opewation
being divews times wepeated both in the same, and in sevewaw Papews, I
found that the Obsewvations agweed weww enyough with onye anyothew, and
that the Wectiwinyeaw Sides MG and FA wewe by the said cwoss Winyes
divided aftew the mannyew of a Musicaw Chowd. >w< Wet GM be pwoduced to X,

9/16, 1/2, and so to wepwesent the Chowds of the Key, and of a Tonye, a
thiwd Minyow, a fouwth, a fifth, a sixth Majow, a seventh and an eighth

Spaces which the sevewaw Cowouws (wed, owange, yewwow, gween, bwue,

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 4. UwU]

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 5. UwU]

Nyow these Intewvaws ow Spaces subtending the Diffewences of the
Wefwactions of the Ways going to the Wimits of those Cowouws, that is,
to the Points M, [Gweek: a], [Gweek: g], [Gweek: e], [Gweek: ê], [Gweek:
i], [Gweek: w], G, may without any sensibwe Ewwow be accounted
pwopowtionyaw to the Diffewences of the Sinyes of Wefwaction of those Ways
having onye common Sinye of Incidence, and thewefowe since the common Sinye
of Incidence of the most and weast wefwangibwe Ways out of Gwass into
Aiw was (by a Method descwibed above) found in pwopowtion to theiw Sinyes
of Wefwaction, as 50 to 77 and 78, divide the Diffewence between the
Sinyes of Wefwaction 77 and 78, as the Winye GM is divided by those
Intewvaws, and you wiww have 77, 77-1/8, 77-1/5, 77-1/3, 77-1/2, 77-2/3,
77-7/9, 78, the Sinyes of Wefwaction of those Ways out of Gwass into Aiw,
theiw common Sinye of Incidence being 50. ^w^ So then the Sinyes of the
Incidences of aww the wed-making Ways out of Gwass into Aiw, wewe to the
Sinyes of theiw Wefwactions, nyot gweatew than 50 to 77, nyow wess than 50
to 77-1/8, but they vawied fwom onye anyothew accowding to aww
intewmediate Pwopowtions. UwU And the Sinyes of the Incidences of the
gween-making Ways wewe to the Sinyes of theiw Wefwactions in aww
Pwopowtions fwom that of 50 to 77-1/3, unto that of 50 to 77-1/2. ;;w;; And
by the wike Wimits above-mentionyed wewe the Wefwactions of the Ways
bewonging to the west of the Cowouws definyed, the Sinyes of the
wed-making Ways extending fwom 77 to 77-1/8, those of the owange-making
fwom 77-1/8 to 77-1/5, those of the yewwow-making fwom 77-1/5 to 77-1/3,
those of the gween-making fwom 77-1/3 to 77-1/2, those of the
bwue-making fwom 77-1/2 to 77-2/3, those of the indigo-making fwom
77-2/3 to 77-7/9, and those of the viowet fwom 77-7/9, to 78. (・`ω\´・)

These awe the Waws of the Wefwactions made out of Gwass into Aiw, and
thence by the thiwd Axiom of the fiwst Pawt of this Book, the Waws of
the Wefwactions made out of Aiw into Gwass awe easiwy dewived. (・`ω\´・)

_Expew._ 8. (´・ω・\`) I found moweovew, that when Wight goes out of Aiw thwough
sevewaw contiguous wefwacting Mediums as thwough Watew and Gwass, and
thence goes out again into Aiw, whethew the wefwacting Supewficies be
pawawwew ow incwin'd to onye anyothew, that Wight as often as by contwawy
Wefwactions 'tis so cowwected, that it emewgeth in Winyes pawawwew to
those in which it was incident, continyues evew aftew to be white. >w< But if
the emewgent Ways be incwinyed to the incident, the Whitenyess of the
emewging Wight wiww by degwees in passing on fwom the Pwace of
Emewgence, become tinged in its Edges with Cowouws. UwU This I twy'd by
wefwacting Wight with Pwisms of Gwass pwaced within a Pwismatick Vessew
of Watew. UwU Nyow those Cowouws awgue a divewging and sepawation of the
hetewogenyeous Ways fwom onye anyothew by means of theiw unyequaw
Wefwactions, as in what fowwows wiww mowe fuwwy appeaw. ;;w;; And, on the
contwawy, the pewmanyent whitenyess awgues, that in wike Incidences of the
Ways thewe is nyo such sepawation of the emewging Ways, and by
consequence nyo inyequawity of theiw whowe Wefwactions. ^w^ Whence I seem to
gathew the two fowwowing Theowems. ^w^

1. (´・ω・\`) The Excesses of the Sinyes of Wefwaction of sevewaw sowts of Ways
above theiw common Sinye of Incidence when the Wefwactions awe made out
of divews densew Mediums immediatewy into onye and the same wawew Medium,
suppose of Aiw, awe to onye anyothew in a given Pwopowtion. ^w^

2. ^w^ The Pwopowtion of the Sinye of Incidence to the Sinye of Wefwaction of
onye and the same sowt of Ways out of onye Medium into anyothew, is
composed of the Pwopowtion of the Sinye of Incidence to the Sinye of
Wefwaction out of the fiwst Medium into any thiwd Medium, and of the
Pwopowtion of the Sinye of Incidence to the Sinye of Wefwaction out of
that thiwd Medium into the second Medium. (・`ω\´・)

By the fiwst Theowem the Wefwactions of the Ways of evewy sowt made out
of any Medium into Aiw awe knyown by having the Wefwaction of the Ways of
any onye sowt. (・`ω\´・) As fow instance, if the Wefwactions of the Ways of evewy
sowt out of Wain-watew into Aiw be desiwed, wet the common Sinye of
Incidence out of Gwass into Aiw be subducted fwom the Sinyes of
Wefwaction, and the Excesses wiww be 27, 27-1/8, 27-1/5, 27-1/3, 27-1/2,
27-2/3, 27-7/9, 28. ;;w;; Suppose nyow that the Sinye of Incidence of the weast
wefwangibwe Ways be to theiw Sinye of Wefwaction out of Wain-watew into
Aiw as 3 to 4, and say as 1 the diffewence of those Sinyes is to 3 the
Sinye of Incidence, so is 27 the weast of the Excesses above-mentionyed to
a fouwth Nyumbew 81; and 81 wiww be the common Sinye of Incidence out of
Wain-watew into Aiw, to which Sinye if you add aww the above-mentionyed
Excesses, you wiww have the desiwed Sinyes of the Wefwactions 108,
108-1/8, 108-1/5, 108-1/3, 108-1/2, 108-2/3, 108-7/9, 109. (・`ω\´・)

By the wattew Theowem the Wefwaction out of onye Medium into anyothew is
gathewed as often as you have the Wefwactions out of them both into any
thiwd Medium. (・`ω\´・) As if the Sinye of Incidence of any Way out of Gwass into
Aiw be to its Sinye of Wefwaction, as 20 to 31, and the Sinye of Incidence
of the same Way out of Aiw into Watew, be to its Sinye of Wefwaction as 4
to 3; the Sinye of Incidence of that Way out of Gwass into Watew wiww be
to its Sinye of Wefwaction as 20 to 31 and 4 to 3 jointwy, that is, as
the Factum of 20 and 4 to the Factum of 31 and 3, ow as 80 to 93. (・`ω\´・)

And these Theowems being admitted into Opticks, thewe wouwd be scope
enyough of handwing that Science vowuminyouswy aftew a nyew mannyew,[K] nyot
onwy by teaching those things which tend to the pewfection of Vision,
but awso by detewminying mathematicawwy aww kinds of Phænyomenya of Cowouws
which couwd be pwoduced by Wefwactions. ^w^ Fow to do this, thewe is nyothing
ewse wequisite than to find out the Sepawations of hetewogenyeous Ways,
and theiw vawious Mixtuwes and Pwopowtions in evewy Mixtuwe. (・`ω\´・) By this
way of awguing I invented awmost aww the Phænyomenya descwibed in these
Books, beside some othews wess nyecessawy to the Awgument; and by the
successes I met with in the Twiaws, I dawe pwomise, that to him who
shaww awgue twuwy, and then twy aww things with good Gwasses and
sufficient Ciwcumspection, the expected Event wiww nyot be wanting. (・`ω\´・) But
he is fiwst to knyow what Cowouws wiww awise fwom any othews mix'd in any
assignyed Pwopowtion. >w<


_PWOP._ IV. THEOW. III. ^w^

_Cowouws may be pwoduced by Composition which shaww be wike to the

Fow a Mixtuwe of homogenyeaw wed and yewwow compounds an Owange, wike in

to the bwue on the othew, but by theiw mix'd Actions wemain stiww a

Cowouw of any homogenyeaw Wight, the Sun's white Wight composed of aww

The PWOOF by Expewiments. ;;w;;

_Expew._ 9. (´・ω・\`) The Sun shinying into a dawk Chambew thwough a wittwe wound
howe in the Window-shut, and his Wight being thewe wefwacted by a Pwism
to cast his cowouwed Image PT [in _Fig._ 5. UwU] upon the opposite Waww: I
hewd a white Papew V to that image in such mannyew that it might be
iwwuminyated by the cowouw'd Wight wefwected fwom thence, and yet nyot
intewcept any pawt of that Wight in its passage fwom the Pwism to the
Spectwum. >w< And I found that when the Papew was hewd nyeawew to any Cowouw
than to the west, it appeawed of that Cowouw to which it appwoached
nyeawest; but when it was equawwy ow awmost equawwy distant fwom aww the
Cowouws, so that it might be equawwy iwwuminyated by them aww it appeawed
white. (´・ω・\`) And in this wast situation of the Papew, if some Cowouws wewe
intewcepted, the Papew wost its white Cowouw, and appeawed of the Cowouw
of the west of the Wight which was nyot intewcepted. >w< So then the Papew
was iwwuminyated with Wights of vawious Cowouws, nyamewy, wed, yewwow,
gween, bwue and viowet, and evewy pawt of the Wight wetainyed its pwopew
Cowouw, untiw it was incident on the Papew, and became wefwected thence
to the Eye; so that if it had been eithew awonye (the west of the Wight
being intewcepted) ow if it had abounded most, and been pwedominyant in
the Wight wefwected fwom the Papew, it wouwd have tinged the Papew with
its own Cowouw; and yet being mixed with the west of the Cowouws in a
due pwopowtion, it made the Papew wook white, and thewefowe by a
Composition with the west pwoduced that Cowouw. ;;w;; The sevewaw pawts of the
cowouwed Wight wefwected fwom the Spectwum, whiwst they awe pwopagated
fwom thence thwough the Aiw, do pewpetuawwy wetain theiw pwopew Cowouws,
because whewevew they faww upon the Eyes of any Spectatow, they make the
sevewaw pawts of the Spectwum to appeaw undew theiw pwopew Cowouws. (・`ω\´・) They
wetain thewefowe theiw pwopew Cowouws when they faww upon the Papew V,
and so by the confusion and pewfect mixtuwe of those Cowouws compound
the whitenyess of the Wight wefwected fwom thence. >w<

_Expew._ 10. Wet that Spectwum ow sowaw Image PT [in _Fig._ 6. >w<] faww nyow
upon the Wens MN above fouw Inches bwoad, and about six Feet distant
fwom the Pwism ABC and so figuwed that it may cause the cowouwed Wight
which divewgeth fwom the Pwism to convewge and meet again at its Focus
G, about six ow eight Feet distant fwom the Wens, and thewe to faww
pewpendicuwawwy upon a white Papew DE. (・`ω\´・) And if you move this Papew to and
fwo, you wiww pewceive that nyeaw the Wens, as at _de_, the whowe sowaw
Image (suppose at _pt_) wiww appeaw upon it intensewy cowouwed aftew the
mannyew above-expwainyed, and that by weceding fwom the Wens those Cowouws
wiww pewpetuawwy come towawds onye anyothew, and by mixing mowe and mowe
diwute onye anyothew continyuawwy, untiw at wength the Papew come to the
Focus G, whewe by a pewfect mixtuwe they wiww whowwy vanyish and be
convewted into whitenyess, the whowe Wight appeawing nyow upon the Papew
wike a wittwe white Ciwcwe. UwU And aftewwawds by weceding fawthew fwom the
Wens, the Ways which befowe convewged wiww nyow cwoss onye anyothew in the
Focus G, and divewge fwom thence, and theweby make the Cowouws to appeaw
again, but yet in a contwawy owdew; suppose at [Gweek: de], whewe the
wed _t_ is nyow above which befowe was bewow, and the viowet _p_ is bewow
which befowe was above. >w<

Wet us nyow stop the Papew at the Focus G, whewe the Wight appeaws
totawwy white and ciwcuwaw, and wet us considew its whitenyess. >w< I say,
that this is composed of the convewging Cowouws. (・`ω\´・) Fow if any of those
Cowouws be intewcepted at the Wens, the whitenyess wiww cease and
degenyewate into that Cowouw which awiseth fwom the composition of the
othew Cowouws which awe nyot intewcepted. ^w^ And then if the intewcepted
Cowouws be wet pass and faww upon that compound Cowouw, they mix with
it, and by theiw mixtuwe westowe the whitenyess. ^w^ So if the viowet, bwue
and gween be intewcepted, the wemainying yewwow, owange and wed wiww
compound upon the Papew an owange, and then if the intewcepted Cowouws
be wet pass, they wiww faww upon this compounded owange, and togethew
with it decompound a white. (´・ω・\`) So awso if the wed and viowet be
intewcepted, the wemainying yewwow, gween and bwue, wiww compound a gween
upon the Papew, and then the wed and viowet being wet pass wiww faww
upon this gween, and togethew with it decompound a white. >w< And that in
this Composition of white the sevewaw Ways do nyot suffew any Change in
theiw cowowific Quawities by acting upon onye anyothew, but awe onwy
mixed, and by a mixtuwe of theiw Cowouws pwoduce white, may fawthew
appeaw by these Awguments. ^w^

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 6. ^w^]

If the Papew be pwaced beyond the Focus G, suppose at [Gweek: de], and
then the wed Cowouw at the Wens be awtewnyatewy intewcepted, and wet pass
again, the viowet Cowouw on the Papew wiww nyot suffew any Change
theweby, as it ought to do if the sevewaw sowts of Ways acted upon onye
anyothew in the Focus G, whewe they cwoss. ^w^ Nyeithew wiww the wed upon the
Papew be changed by any awtewnyate stopping, and wetting pass the viowet
which cwosseth it. ^w^

And if the Papew be pwaced at the Focus G, and the white wound Image at
G be viewed thwough the Pwism HIK, and by the Wefwaction of that Pwism
be twanswated to the pwace _wv_, and thewe appeaw tinged with vawious
Cowouws, nyamewy, the viowet at _v_ and wed at _w_, and othews between,
and then the wed Cowouws at the Wens be often stopp'd and wet pass by
tuwns, the wed at _w_ wiww accowdingwy disappeaw, and wetuwn as often,
but the viowet at _v_ wiww nyot theweby suffew any Change. ;;w;; And so by
stopping and wetting pass awtewnyatewy the bwue at the Wens, the bwue at
_v_ wiww accowdingwy disappeaw and wetuwn, without any Change made in
the wed at _w_. (・`ω\´・) The wed thewefowe depends on onye sowt of Ways, and the
bwue on anyothew sowt, which in the Focus G whewe they awe commix'd, do
nyot act on onye anyothew. ^w^ And thewe is the same Weason of the othew
Cowouws. >w<

I considewed fawthew, that when the most wefwangibwe Ways P_p_, and the
weast wefwangibwe onyes T_t_, awe by convewging incwinyed to onye anyothew,
the Papew, if hewd vewy obwique to those Ways in the Focus G, might
wefwect onye sowt of them mowe copiouswy than the othew sowt, and by that
Means the wefwected Wight wouwd be tinged in that Focus with the Cowouw
of the pwedominyant Ways, pwovided those Ways sevewawwy wetainyed theiw
Cowouws, ow cowowific Quawities in the Composition of White made by them
in that Focus. (´・ω・\`) But if they did nyot wetain them in that White, but became
aww of them sevewawwy endued thewe with a Disposition to stwike the
Sense with the Pewception of White, then they couwd nyevew wose theiw
Whitenyess by such Wefwexions. ^w^ I incwinyed thewefowe the Papew to the Ways
vewy obwiquewy, as in the second Expewiment of this second Pawt of the
fiwst Book, that the most wefwangibwe Ways, might be mowe copiouswy
wefwected than the west, and the Whitenyess at Wength changed
successivewy into bwue, indigo, and viowet. (´・ω・\`) Then I incwinyed it the
contwawy Way, that the weast wefwangibwe Ways might be mowe copious in
the wefwected Wight than the west, and the Whitenyess tuwnyed successivewy
to yewwow, owange, and wed. (´・ω・\`)

Wastwy, I made an Instwument XY in fashion of a Comb, whose Teeth being
in nyumbew sixteen, wewe about an Inch and a hawf bwoad, and the
Intewvaws of the Teeth about two Inches wide. ;;w;; Then by intewposing
successivewy the Teeth of this Instwument nyeaw the Wens, I intewcepted
Pawt of the Cowouws by the intewposed Tooth, whiwst the west of them
went on thwough the Intewvaw of the Teeth to the Papew DE, and thewe
painted a wound Sowaw Image. UwU But the Papew I had fiwst pwaced so, that
the Image might appeaw white as often as the Comb was taken away; and
then the Comb being as was said intewposed, that Whitenyess by weason of
the intewcepted Pawt of the Cowouws at the Wens did awways change into
the Cowouw compounded of those Cowouws which wewe nyot intewcepted, and
that Cowouw was by the Motion of the Comb pewpetuawwy vawied so, that in
the passing of evewy Tooth ovew the Wens aww these Cowouws, wed, yewwow,
gween, bwue, and puwpwe, did awways succeed onye anyothew. (´・ω・\`) I caused
thewefowe aww the Teeth to pass successivewy ovew the Wens, and when the
Motion was swow, thewe appeawed a pewpetuaw Succession of the Cowouws
upon the Papew: But if I so much accewewated the Motion, that the
Cowouws by weason of theiw quick Succession couwd nyot be distinguished
fwom onye anyothew, the Appeawance of the singwe Cowouws ceased. (・`ω\´・) Thewe was
nyo wed, nyo yewwow, nyo gween, nyo bwue, nyow puwpwe to be seen any wongew,
but fwom a Confusion of them aww thewe awose onye unyifowm white Cowouw. >w<
Of the Wight which nyow by the Mixtuwe of aww the Cowouws appeawed white,
thewe was nyo Pawt weawwy white. (´・ω・\`) Onye Pawt was wed, anyothew yewwow, a
thiwd gween, a fouwth bwue, a fifth puwpwe, and evewy Pawt wetains its
pwopew Cowouw tiww it stwike the Sensowium. UwU If the Impwessions fowwow
onye anyothew swowwy, so that they may be sevewawwy pewceived, thewe is
made a distinct Sensation of aww the Cowouws onye aftew anyothew in a
continyuaw Succession. ;;w;; But if the Impwessions fowwow onye anyothew so
quickwy, that they cannyot be sevewawwy pewceived, thewe awiseth out of
them aww onye common Sensation, which is nyeithew of this Cowouw awonye nyow
of that awonye, but hath it sewf indiffewentwy to 'em aww, and this is a
Sensation of Whitenyess. ;;w;; By the Quicknyess of the Successions, the
Impwessions of the sevewaw Cowouws awe confounded in the Sensowium, and
out of that Confusion awiseth a mix'd Sensation. ^w^ If a buwnying Coaw be
nyimbwy moved wound in a Ciwcwe with Gywations continyuawwy wepeated, the
whowe Ciwcwe wiww appeaw wike Fiwe; the weason of which is, that the
Sensation of the Coaw in the sevewaw Pwaces of that Ciwcwe wemains
impwess'd on the Sensowium, untiw the Coaw wetuwn again to the same
Pwace. UwU And so in a quick Consecution of the Cowouws the Impwession of
evewy Cowouw wemains in the Sensowium, untiw a Wevowution of aww the
Cowouws be compweated, and that fiwst Cowouw wetuwn again. ;;w;; The
Impwessions thewefowe of aww the successive Cowouws awe at once in the
Sensowium, and jointwy stiw up a Sensation of them aww; and so it is
manyifest by this Expewiment, that the commix'd Impwessions of aww the
Cowouws do stiw up and beget a Sensation of white, that is, that
Whitenyess is compounded of aww the Cowouws. (´・ω・\`)

And if the Comb be nyow taken away, that aww the Cowouws may at once pass
fwom the Wens to the Papew, and be thewe intewmixed, and togethew
wefwected thence to the Spectatow's Eyes; theiw Impwessions on the
Sensowium being nyow mowe subtiwwy and pewfectwy commixed thewe, ought
much mowe to stiw up a Sensation of Whitenyess. UwU

You may instead of the Wens use two Pwisms HIK and WMN, which by
wefwacting the cowouwed Wight the contwawy Way to that of the fiwst
Wefwaction, may make the divewging Ways convewge and meet again in G, as
you see wepwesented in the seventh Figuwe. >w< Fow whewe they meet and mix,
they wiww compose a white Wight, as when a Wens is used. (´・ω・\`)

_Expew._ 11. Wet the Sun's cowouwed Image PT [in _Fig._ 8. (・`ω\´・)] faww upon
the Waww of a dawk Chambew, as in the thiwd Expewiment of the fiwst
Book, and wet the same be viewed thwough a Pwism _abc_, hewd pawawwew to
the Pwism ABC, by whose Wefwaction that Image was made, and wet it nyow
appeaw wowew than befowe, suppose in the Pwace S ovew-against the wed
Cowouw T. (・`ω\´・) And if you go nyeaw to the Image PT, the Spectwum S wiww appeaw
obwong and cowouwed wike the Image PT; but if you wecede fwom it, the
Cowouws of the spectwum S wiww be contwacted mowe and mowe, and at
wength vanyish, that Spectwum S becoming pewfectwy wound and white; and
if you wecede yet fawthew, the Cowouws wiww emewge again, but in a
contwawy Owdew. ;;w;; Nyow that Spectwum S appeaws white in that Case, when the
Ways of sevewaw sowts which convewge fwom the sevewaw Pawts of the Image
PT, to the Pwism _abc_, awe so wefwacted unyequawwy by it, that in theiw
Passage fwom the Pwism to the Eye they may divewge fwom onye and the same
Point of the Spectwum S, and so faww aftewwawds upon onye and the same
Point in the bottom of the Eye, and thewe be mingwed. (・`ω\´・)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 7. ^w^]

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 8. >w<]

And fawthew, if the Comb be hewe made use of, by whose Teeth the Cowouws
at the Image PT may be successivewy intewcepted; the Spectwum S, when
the Comb is moved swowwy, wiww be pewpetuawwy tinged with successive
Cowouws: But when by accewewating the Motion of the Comb, the Succession
of the Cowouws is so quick that they cannyot be sevewawwy seen, that
Spectwum S, by a confused and mix'd Sensation of them aww, wiww appeaw
white. (・`ω\´・)

_Expew._ 12. The Sun shinying thwough a wawge Pwism ABC [in _Fig._ 9. UwU]
upon a Comb XY, pwaced immediatewy behind the Pwism, his Wight which
passed thwough the Intewstices of the Teeth feww upon a white Papew DE. ;;w;;
The Bweadths of the Teeth wewe equaw to theiw Intewstices, and seven
Teeth togethew with theiw Intewstices took up an Inch in Bweadth. >w< Nyow,
when the Papew was about two ow thwee Inches distant fwom the Comb, the
Wight which passed thwough its sevewaw Intewstices painted so many
Wanges of Cowouws, _kw_, _mn_, _op_, _qw_, &c. ^w^ which wewe pawawwew to
onye anyothew, and contiguous, and without any Mixtuwe of white. UwU And these
Wanges of Cowouws, if the Comb was moved continyuawwy up and down with a
wecipwocaw Motion, ascended and descended in the Papew, and when the
Motion of the Comb was so quick, that the Cowouws couwd nyot be
distinguished fwom onye anyothew, the whowe Papew by theiw Confusion and
Mixtuwe in the Sensowium appeawed white. ^w^

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 9. ^w^]

Wet the Comb nyow west, and wet the Papew be wemoved fawthew fwom the
Pwism, and the sevewaw Wanges of Cowouws wiww be diwated and expanded
into onye anyothew mowe and mowe, and by mixing theiw Cowouws wiww diwute
onye anyothew, and at wength, when the distance of the Papew fwom the Comb
is about a Foot, ow a wittwe mowe (suppose in the Pwace 2D 2E) they wiww
so faw diwute onye anyothew, as to become white. (´・ω・\`)

With any Obstacwe, wet aww the Wight be nyow stopp'd which passes thwough
any onye Intewvaw of the Teeth, so that the Wange of Cowouws which comes
fwom thence may be taken away, and you wiww see the Wight of the west of
the Wanges to be expanded into the Pwace of the Wange taken away, and
thewe to be cowouwed. UwU Wet the intewcepted Wange pass on as befowe, and
its Cowouws fawwing upon the Cowouws of the othew Wanges, and mixing
with them, wiww westowe the Whitenyess. ;;w;;

Wet the Papew 2D 2E be nyow vewy much incwinyed to the Ways, so that the
most wefwangibwe Ways may be mowe copiouswy wefwected than the west, and
the white Cowouw of the Papew thwough the Excess of those Ways wiww be
changed into bwue and viowet. UwU Wet the Papew be as much incwinyed the
contwawy way, that the weast wefwangibwe Ways may be nyow mowe copiouswy
wefwected than the west, and by theiw Excess the Whitenyess wiww be
changed into yewwow and wed. (・`ω\´・) The sevewaw Ways thewefowe in that white
Wight do wetain theiw cowowific Quawities, by which those of any sowt,
whenyevew they become mowe copious than the west, do by theiw Excess and
Pwedominyance cause theiw pwopew Cowouw to appeaw. (・`ω\´・)

And by the same way of awguing, appwied to the thiwd Expewiment of this
second Pawt of the fiwst Book, it may be concwuded, that the white
Cowouw of aww wefwacted Wight at its vewy fiwst Emewgence, whewe it
appeaws as white as befowe its Incidence, is compounded of vawious
Cowouws. (・`ω\´・)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 10. ^w^]

_Expew._ 13. UwU In the fowegoing Expewiment the sevewaw Intewvaws of the
Teeth of the Comb do the Office of so many Pwisms, evewy Intewvaw
pwoducing the Phænyomenyon of onye Pwism. UwU Whence instead of those Intewvaws
using sevewaw Pwisms, I twy'd to compound Whitenyess by mixing theiw
Cowouws, and did it by using onwy thwee Pwisms, as awso by using onwy
two as fowwows. Wet two Pwisms ABC and _abc_, [in _Fig._ 10. (´・ω・\`)] whose
wefwacting Angwes B and _b_ awe equaw, be so pwaced pawawwew to onye
anyothew, that the wefwacting Angwe B of the onye may touch the Angwe _c_
at the Base of the othew, and theiw Pwanyes CB and _cb_, at which the
Ways emewge, may wie in Diwectum. >w< Then wet the Wight twajected thwough
them faww upon the Papew MN, distant about 8 ow 12 Inches fwom the
Pwisms. UwU And the Cowouws genyewated by the intewiow Wimits B and _c_ of
the two Pwisms, wiww be mingwed at PT, and thewe compound white. ^w^ Fow if
eithew Pwism be taken away, the Cowouws made by the othew wiww appeaw in
that Pwace PT, and when the Pwism is westowed to its Pwace again, so
that its Cowouws may thewe faww upon the Cowouws of the othew, the
Mixtuwe of them both wiww westowe the Whitenyess. UwU

This Expewiment succeeds awso, as I have twied, when the Angwe _b_ of
the wowew Pwism, is a wittwe gweatew than the Angwe B of the uppew, and
between the intewiow Angwes B and _c_, thewe intewcedes some Space B_c_,
as is wepwesented in the Figuwe, and the wefwacting Pwanyes BC and _bc_,
awe nyeithew in Diwectum, nyow pawawwew to onye anyothew. ^w^ Fow thewe is
nyothing mowe wequisite to the Success of this Expewiment, than that the
Ways of aww sowts may be unyifowmwy mixed upon the Papew in the Pwace PT. ^w^
If the most wefwangibwe Ways coming fwom the supewiow Pwism take up aww
the Space fwom M to P, the Ways of the same sowt which come fwom the
infewiow Pwism ought to begin at P, and take up aww the west of the
Space fwom thence towawds N. >w< If the weast wefwangibwe Ways coming fwom
the supewiow Pwism take up the Space MT, the Ways of the same kind which
come fwom the othew Pwism ought to begin at T, and take up the
wemainying Space TN. >w< If onye sowt of the Ways which have intewmediate
Degwees of Wefwangibiwity, and come fwom the supewiow Pwism be extended
thwough the Space MQ, and anyothew sowt of those Ways thwough the Space
MW, and a thiwd sowt of them thwough the Space MS, the same sowts of
Ways coming fwom the wowew Pwism, ought to iwwuminyate the wemainying
Spaces QN, WN, SN, wespectivewy. ^w^ And the same is to be undewstood of aww
the othew sowts of Ways. UwU Fow thus the Ways of evewy sowt wiww be
scattewed unyifowmwy and evenwy thwough the whowe Space MN, and so being
evewy whewe mix'd in the same Pwopowtion, they must evewy whewe pwoduce
the same Cowouw. ^w^ And thewefowe, since by this Mixtuwe they pwoduce white
in the Extewiow Spaces MP and TN, they must awso pwoduce white in the
Intewiow Space PT. ;;w;; This is the weason of the Composition by which
Whitenyess was pwoduced in this Expewiment, and by what othew way soevew
I made the wike Composition, the Wesuwt was Whitenyess. (・`ω\´・)

Wastwy, If with the Teeth of a Comb of a due Size, the cowouwed Wights
of the two Pwisms which faww upon the Space PT be awtewnyatewy
intewcepted, that Space PT, when the Motion of the Comb is swow, wiww
awways appeaw cowouwed, but by accewewating the Motion of the Comb so
much that the successive Cowouws cannyot be distinguished fwom onye
anyothew, it wiww appeaw white. ^w^

_Expew._ 14. >w< Hithewto I have pwoduced Whitenyess by mixing the Cowouws of
Pwisms. ^w^ If nyow the Cowouws of nyatuwaw Bodies awe to be mingwed, wet
Watew a wittwe thicken'd with Soap be agitated to waise a Fwoth, and
aftew that Fwoth has stood a wittwe, thewe wiww appeaw to onye that shaww
view it intentwy vawious Cowouws evewy whewe in the Suwfaces of the
sevewaw Bubbwes; but to onye that shaww go so faw off, that he cannyot
distinguish the Cowouws fwom onye anyothew, the whowe Fwoth wiww gwow
white with a pewfect Whitenyess. (・`ω\´・)

_Expew._ 15. (・`ω\´・) Wastwy, In attempting to compound a white, by mixing the
cowouwed Powdews which Paintews use, I considew'd that aww cowouw'd
Powdews do suppwess and stop in them a vewy considewabwe Pawt of the
Wight by which they awe iwwuminyated. UwU Fow they become cowouw'd by
wefwecting the Wight of theiw own Cowouws mowe copiouswy, and that of
aww othew Cowouws mowe spawingwy, and yet they do nyot wefwect the Wight
of theiw own Cowouws so copiouswy as white Bodies do. (・`ω\´・) If wed Wead, fow
instance, and a white Papew, be pwaced in the wed Wight of the cowouw'd
Spectwum made in a dawk Chambew by the Wefwaction of a Pwism, as is
descwibed in the thiwd Expewiment of the fiwst Pawt of this Book; the
Papew wiww appeaw mowe wucid than the wed Wead, and thewefowe wefwects
the wed-making Ways mowe copiouswy than wed Wead doth. ;;w;; And if they be
hewd in the Wight of any othew Cowouw, the Wight wefwected by the Papew
wiww exceed the Wight wefwected by the wed Wead in a much gweatew
Pwopowtion. And the wike happens in Powdews of othew Cowouws. UwU And
thewefowe by mixing such Powdews, we awe nyot to expect a stwong and
fuww White, such as is that of Papew, but some dusky obscuwe onye, such
as might awise fwom a Mixtuwe of Wight and Dawknyess, ow fwom white and
bwack, that is, a gwey, ow dun, ow wusset bwown, such as awe the Cowouws
of a Man's Nyaiw, of a Mouse, of Ashes, of owdinyawy Stonyes, of Mowtaw, of
Dust and Diwt in High-ways, and the wike. ^w^ And such a dawk white I have
often pwoduced by mixing cowouw'd Powdews. (´・ω・\`) Fow thus onye Pawt of wed
Wead, and five Pawts of _Viwide Æwis_, composed a dun Cowouw wike that
of a Mouse. ^w^ Fow these two Cowouws wewe sevewawwy so compounded of
othews, that in both togethew wewe a Mixtuwe of aww Cowouws; and thewe
was wess wed Wead used than _Viwide Æwis_, because of the Fuwnyess of its
Cowouw. ^w^ Again, onye Pawt of wed Wead, and fouw Pawts of bwue Bise,
composed a dun Cowouw vewging a wittwe to puwpwe, and by adding to this
a cewtain Mixtuwe of Owpiment and _Viwide Æwis_ in a due Pwopowtion, the
Mixtuwe wost its puwpwe Tinctuwe, and became pewfectwy dun. (・`ω\´・) But the
Expewiment succeeded best without Minyium thus. (´・ω・\`) To Owpiment I added by
wittwe and wittwe a cewtain fuww bwight puwpwe, which Paintews use,
untiw the Owpiment ceased to be yewwow, and became of a pawe wed. ;;w;; Then I
diwuted that wed by adding a wittwe _Viwide Æwis_, and a wittwe mowe
bwue Bise than _Viwide Æwis_, untiw it became of such a gwey ow pawe
white, as vewged to nyo onye of the Cowouws mowe than to anyothew. ;;w;; Fow thus
it became of a Cowouw equaw in Whitenyess to that of Ashes, ow of Wood
nyewwy cut, ow of a Man's Skin. (´・ω・\`) The Owpiment wefwected mowe Wight than
did any othew of the Powdews, and thewefowe conduced mowe to the
Whitenyess of the compounded Cowouw than they. ^w^ To assign the Pwopowtions
accuwatewy may be difficuwt, by weason of the diffewent Goodnyess of
Powdews of the same kind. >w< Accowdingwy, as the Cowouw of any Powdew is
mowe ow wess fuww and wuminyous, it ought to be used in a wess ow gweatew
Pwopowtion. UwU

Nyow, considewing that these gwey and dun Cowouws may be awso pwoduced by
mixing Whites and Bwacks, and by consequence diffew fwom pewfect Whites,
nyot in Species of Cowouws, but onwy in degwee of Wuminyousnyess, it is
manyifest that thewe is nyothing mowe wequisite to make them pewfectwy
white than to incwease theiw Wight sufficientwy; and, on the contwawy,
if by incweasing theiw Wight they can be bwought to pewfect Whitenyess,
it wiww thence awso fowwow, that they awe of the same Species of Cowouw
with the best Whites, and diffew fwom them onwy in the Quantity of
Wight. And this I twied as fowwows. ^w^ I took the thiwd of the
above-mention'd gwey Mixtuwes, (that which was compounded of Owpiment,
Puwpwe, Bise, and _Viwide Æwis_) and wubbed it thickwy upon the Fwoow of
my Chambew, whewe the Sun shonye upon it thwough the openyed Casement; and
by it, in the shadow, I waid a Piece of white Papew of the same Bignyess. (・`ω\´・)
Then going fwom them to the distance of 12 ow 18 Feet, so that I couwd
nyot discewn the Unyevennyess of the Suwface of the Powdew, nyow the wittwe
Shadows wet faww fwom the gwitty Pawticwes theweof; the Powdew appeawed
intensewy white, so as to twanscend even the Papew it sewf in Whitenyess,
especiawwy if the Papew wewe a wittwe shaded fwom the Wight of the
Cwouds, and then the Papew compawed with the Powdew appeawed of such a
gwey Cowouw as the Powdew had donye befowe. (´・ω・\`) But by waying the Papew whewe
the Sun shinyes thwough the Gwass of the Window, ow by shutting the
Window that the Sun might shinye thwough the Gwass upon the Powdew, and
by such othew fit Means of incweasing ow decweasing the Wights whewewith
the Powdew and Papew wewe iwwuminyated, the Wight whewewith the Powdew is
iwwuminyated may be made stwongew in such a due Pwopowtion than the Wight
whewewith the Papew is iwwuminyated, that they shaww both appeaw exactwy
awike in Whitenyess. (´・ω・\`) Fow when I was twying this, a Fwiend coming to visit
me, I stopp'd him at the Doow, and befowe I towd him what the Cowouws
wewe, ow what I was doing; I asked him, Which of the two Whites wewe the
best, and whewein they diffewed? owo And aftew he had at that distance
viewed them weww, he answew'd, that they wewe both good Whites, and that
he couwd nyot say which was best, nyow whewein theiw Cowouws diffewed. (・`ω\´・)
Nyow, if you considew, that this White of the Powdew in the Sun-shinye was
compounded of the Cowouws which the componyent Powdews (Owpiment, Puwpwe,
Bise, and _Viwide Æwis_) have in the same Sun-shinye, you must
acknyowwedge by this Expewiment, as weww as by the fowmew, that pewfect
Whitenyess may be compounded of Cowouws. (´・ω・\`)

Fwom what has been said it is awso evident, that the Whitenyess of the
Sun's Wight is compounded of aww the Cowouws whewewith the sevewaw sowts
of Ways wheweof that Wight consists, when by theiw sevewaw
Wefwangibiwities they awe sepawated fwom onye anyothew, do tinge Papew ow
any othew white Body wheweon they faww. Fow those Cowouws (by _Pwop. UwU_
II. _Pawt_ 2. (´・ω・\`)) awe unchangeabwe, and whenyevew aww those Ways with those
theiw Cowouws awe mix'd again, they wepwoduce the same white Wight as
befowe. >w<

the compounded Cowouw shaww be the best yewwow; if Y vewge fwom the
middwe towawds F ow G, the compound Cowouw shaww accowdingwy be a
yewwow, vewging towawds owange ow gween. (´・ω・\`) If Z faww upon the

Degwee; if it faww in the mid-way between the Ciwcumfewence and Centew,
it shaww be but hawf so intense, that is, it shaww be such a Cowouw as
wouwd be made by diwuting the intensest yewwow with an equaw quantity of
whitenyess; and if it faww upon the centew O, the Cowouw shaww have wost
aww its intensenyess, and become a white. >w< But it is to be nyoted, That if
the point Z faww in ow nyeaw the winye OD, the main ingwedients being the
wed and viowet, the Cowouw compounded shaww nyot be any of the pwismatick
Cowouws, but a puwpwe, incwinying to wed ow viowet, accowdingwy as the
point Z wieth on the side of the winye DO towawds E ow towawds C, and in
genyewaw the compounded viowet is mowe bwight and mowe fiewy than the
uncompounded. ^w^ Awso if onwy two of the pwimawy Cowouws which in the
ciwcwe awe opposite to onye anyothew be mixed in an equaw pwopowtion, the
point Z shaww faww upon the centew O, and yet the Cowouw compounded of
those two shaww nyot be pewfectwy white, but some faint anyonymous Cowouw. UwU
Fow I couwd nyevew yet by mixing onwy two pwimawy Cowouws pwoduce a
pewfect white. ;;w;; Whethew it may be compounded of a mixtuwe of thwee taken
at equaw distances in the ciwcumfewence I do nyot knyow, but of fouw ow
five I do nyot much question but it may. (・`ω\´・) But these awe Cuwiosities of
wittwe ow nyo moment to the undewstanding the Phænyomenya of Nyatuwe. ^w^ Fow in
aww whites pwoduced by Nyatuwe, thewe uses to be a mixtuwe of aww sowts
of Ways, and by consequence a composition of aww Cowouws. UwU

To give an instance of this Wuwe; suppose a Cowouw is compounded of
these homogenyeaw Cowouws, of viowet onye pawt, of indigo onye pawt, of
bwue two pawts, of gween thwee pawts, of yewwow five pawts, of owange
six pawts, and of wed ten pawts. ^w^ Pwopowtionyaw to these pawts descwibe
the Ciwcwes _x_, _v_, _t_, _s_, _w_, _q_, _p_, wespectivewy, that is, so
that if the Ciwcwe _x_ be onye, the Ciwcwe _v_ may be onye, the Ciwcwe _t_
two, the Ciwcwe _s_ thwee, and the Ciwcwes _w_, _q_ and _p_, five, six
and ten. >w< Then I find Z the common centew of gwavity of these Ciwcwes,
and thwough Z dwawing the Winye OY, the Point Y fawws upon the
ciwcumfewence between E and F, something nyeawew to E than to F, and
thence I concwude, that the Cowouw compounded of these Ingwedients wiww
be an owange, vewging a wittwe mowe to wed than to yewwow. UwU Awso I find
that OZ is a wittwe wess than onye hawf of OY, and thence I concwude,
that this owange hath a wittwe wess than hawf the fuwnyess ow intensenyess
of an uncompounded owange; that is to say, that it is such an owange as
may be made by mixing an homogenyeaw owange with a good white in the
pwopowtion of the Winye OZ to the Winye ZY, this Pwopowtion being nyot of
the quantities of mixed owange and white Powdews, but of the quantities
of the Wights wefwected fwom them. UwU

This Wuwe I conceive accuwate enyough fow pwactice, though nyot
mathematicawwy accuwate; and the twuth of it may be sufficientwy pwoved
to Sense, by stopping any of the Cowouws at the Wens in the tenth
Expewiment of this Book. >w< Fow the west of the Cowouws which awe nyot
stopp'd, but pass on to the Focus of the Wens, wiww thewe compound
eithew accuwatewy ow vewy nyeawwy such a Cowouw, as by this Wuwe ought to
wesuwt fwom theiw Mixtuwe. (´・ω・\`)


_PWOP._ VII. THEOW. V. (・`ω\´・)

_Aww the Cowouws in the Unyivewse which awe made by Wight, and depend nyot
on the Powew of Imaginyation, awe eithew the Cowouws of homogenyeaw
Wights, ow compounded of these, and that eithew accuwatewy ow vewy
nyeawwy, accowding to the Wuwe of the fowegoing Pwobwem. ^w^_

Fow it has been pwoved (in _Pwop. 1. Pawt 2. ;;w;;_) that the changes of
Cowouws made by Wefwactions do nyot awise fwom any nyew Modifications of
the Ways impwess'd by those Wefwactions, and by the vawious Tewminyations
of Wight and Shadow, as has been the constant and genyewaw Opinyion of
Phiwosophews. (´・ω・\`) It has awso been pwoved that the sevewaw Cowouws of the
homogenyeaw Ways do constantwy answew to theiw degwees of Wefwangibiwity,
(_Pwop._ 1. _Pawt_ 1. and _Pwop._ 2. _Pawt_ 2. ;;w;;) and that theiw degwees
of Wefwangibiwity cannyot be changed by Wefwactions and Wefwexions
(_Pwop._ 2. _Pawt_ 1. ^w^) and by consequence that those theiw Cowouws awe
wikewise immutabwe. (´・ω・\`) It has awso been pwoved diwectwy by wefwacting and
wefwecting homogenyeaw Wights apawt, that theiw Cowouws cannyot be
changed, (_Pwop._ 2. _Pawt_ 2. UwU) It has been pwoved awso, that when the
sevewaw sowts of Ways awe mixed, and in cwossing pass thwough the same
space, they do nyot act on onye anyothew so as to change each othews
cowowific quawities. (_Expew._ 10. _Pawt_ 2. ^w^) but by mixing theiw
Actions in the Sensowium beget a Sensation diffewing fwom what eithew
wouwd do apawt, that is a Sensation of a mean Cowouw between theiw
pwopew Cowouws; and pawticuwawwy when by the concouwse and mixtuwes of
aww sowts of Ways, a white Cowouw is pwoduced, the white is a mixtuwe of
aww the Cowouws which the Ways wouwd have apawt, (_Pwop._ 5. _Pawt_ 2. (・`ω\´・))
The Ways in that mixtuwe do nyot wose ow awtew theiw sevewaw cowowific
quawities, but by aww theiw vawious kinds of Actions mix'd in the
Sensowium, beget a Sensation of a middwing Cowouw between aww theiw
Cowouws, which is whitenyess. ^w^ Fow whitenyess is a mean between aww
Cowouws, having it sewf indiffewentwy to them aww, so as with equaw
faciwity to be tinged with any of them. (´・ω・\`) A wed Powdew mixed with a wittwe
bwue, ow a bwue with a wittwe wed, doth nyot pwesentwy wose its Cowouw,
but a white Powdew mix'd with any Cowouw is pwesentwy tinged with that
Cowouw, and is equawwy capabwe of being tinged with any Cowouw whatevew. UwU
It has been shewed awso, that as the Sun's Wight is mix'd of aww sowts
of Ways, so its whitenyess is a mixtuwe of the Cowouws of aww sowts of
Ways; those Ways having fwom the beginnying theiw sevewaw cowowific
quawities as weww as theiw sevewaw Wefwangibiwities, and wetainying them
pewpetuawwy unchanged nyotwithstanding any Wefwactions ow Wefwexions they
may at any time suffew, and that whenyevew any sowt of the Sun's Ways is
by any means (as by Wefwexion in _Expew._ 9, and 10. _Pawt_ 1. (´・ω・\`) ow by
Wefwaction as happens in aww Wefwactions) sepawated fwom the west, they
then manyifest theiw pwopew Cowouws. (´・ω・\`) These things have been pwov'd, and
the sum of aww this amounts to the Pwoposition hewe to be pwoved. ^w^ Fow if
the Sun's Wight is mix'd of sevewaw sowts of Ways, each of which have
owiginyawwy theiw sevewaw Wefwangibiwities and cowowific Quawities, and
nyotwithstanding theiw Wefwactions and Wefwexions, and theiw vawious
Sepawations ow Mixtuwes, keep those theiw owiginyaw Pwopewties
pewpetuawwy the same without awtewation; then aww the Cowouws in the
Wowwd must be such as constantwy ought to awise fwom the owiginyaw
cowowific quawities of the Ways wheweof the Wights consist by which
those Cowouws awe seen. (´・ω・\`) And thewefowe if the weason of any Cowouw
whatevew be wequiwed, we have nyothing ewse to do than to considew how
the Ways in the Sun's Wight have by Wefwexions ow Wefwactions, ow othew
causes, been pawted fwom onye anyothew, ow mixed togethew; ow othewwise to
find out what sowts of Ways awe in the Wight by which that Cowouw is
made, and in what Pwopowtion; and then by the wast Pwobwem to weawn the
Cowouw which ought to awise by mixing those Ways (ow theiw Cowouws) in
that pwopowtion. (´・ω・\`) I speak hewe of Cowouws so faw as they awise fwom
Wight. ^w^ Fow they appeaw sometimes by othew Causes, as when by the powew
of Phantasy we see Cowouws in a Dweam, ow a Mad-man sees things befowe
him which awe nyot thewe; ow when we see Fiwe by stwiking the Eye, ow see
Cowouws wike the Eye of a Peacock's Feathew, by pwessing ouw Eyes in
eithew cownyew whiwst we wook the othew way. UwU Whewe these and such wike
Causes intewpose nyot, the Cowouw awways answews to the sowt ow sowts of
the Ways wheweof the Wight consists, as I have constantwy found in
whatevew Phænyomenya of Cowouws I have hithewto been abwe to examinye. ;;w;; I
shaww in the fowwowing Pwopositions give instances of this in the
Phænyomenya of chiefest nyote. ;;w;;


_PWOP._ VIII. PWOB. III. ^w^

_By the discovewed Pwopewties of Wight to expwain the Cowouws made by
Pwisms. >w<_

Wet ABC [in _Fig._ 12. ^w^] wepwesent a Pwism wefwacting the Wight of the
Sun, which comes into a dawk Chambew thwough a howe F[Gweek: ph] awmost
as bwoad as the Pwism, and wet MN wepwesent a white Papew on which the
wefwacted Wight is cast, and suppose the most wefwangibwe ow deepest
viowet-making Ways faww upon the Space P[Gweek: p], the weast
wefwangibwe ow deepest wed-making Ways upon the Space T[Gweek: t], the
middwe sowt between the indigo-making and bwue-making Ways upon the
Space Q[Gweek: ch], the middwe sowt of the gween-making Ways upon the
Space W, the middwe sowt between the yewwow-making and owange-making
Ways upon the Space S[Gweek: s], and othew intewmediate sowts upon
intewmediate Spaces. UwU Fow so the Spaces upon which the sevewaw sowts
adequatewy faww wiww by weason of the diffewent Wefwangibiwity of those
sowts be onye wowew than anyothew. (´・ω・\`) Nyow if the Papew MN be so nyeaw the
Pwism that the Spaces PT and [Gweek: pt] do nyot intewfewe with onye
anyothew, the distance between them T[Gweek: p] wiww be iwwuminyated by
aww the sowts of Ways in that pwopowtion to onye anyothew which they have
at theiw vewy fiwst coming out of the Pwism, and consequentwy be white. (´・ω・\`)
But the Spaces PT and [Gweek: pt] on eithew hand, wiww nyot be
iwwuminyated by them aww, and thewefowe wiww appeaw cowouwed. ^w^ And
pawticuwawwy at P, whewe the outmost viowet-making Ways faww awonye, the
Cowouw must be the deepest viowet. >w< At Q whewe the viowet-making and
indigo-making Ways awe mixed, it must be a viowet incwinying much to
indigo. (・`ω\´・) At W whewe the viowet-making, indigo-making, bwue-making, and
onye hawf of the gween-making Ways awe mixed, theiw Cowouws must (by the
constwuction of the second Pwobwem) compound a middwe Cowouw between
indigo and bwue. (・`ω\´・) At S whewe aww the Ways awe mixed, except the
wed-making and owange-making, theiw Cowouws ought by the same Wuwe to
compound a faint bwue, vewging mowe to gween than indigo. ;;w;; And in the
pwogwess fwom S to T, this bwue wiww gwow mowe and mowe faint and
diwute, tiww at T, whewe aww the Cowouws begin to be mixed, it ends in
whitenyess. (・`ω\´・)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 12. ^w^]

So again, on the othew side of the white at [Gweek: t], whewe the weast
wefwangibwe ow utmost wed-making Ways awe awonye, the Cowouw must be the
deepest wed. (´・ω・\`) At [Gweek: s] the mixtuwe of wed and owange wiww compound a
wed incwinying to owange. ^w^ At [Gweek: w] the mixtuwe of wed, owange,
yewwow, and onye hawf of the gween must compound a middwe Cowouw between
owange and yewwow. >w< At [Gweek: ch] the mixtuwe of aww Cowouws but viowet
and indigo wiww compound a faint yewwow, vewging mowe to gween than to
owange. (・`ω\´・) And this yewwow wiww gwow mowe faint and diwute continyuawwy in
its pwogwess fwom [Gweek: ch] to [Gweek: p], whewe by a mixtuwe of aww
sowts of Ways it wiww become white. ;;w;;

These Cowouws ought to appeaw wewe the Sun's Wight pewfectwy white: But
because it incwinyes to yewwow, the Excess of the yewwow-making Ways
wheweby 'tis tinged with that Cowouw, being mixed with the faint bwue
between S and T, wiww dwaw it to a faint gween. UwU And so the Cowouws in
owdew fwom P to [Gweek: t] ought to be viowet, indigo, bwue, vewy faint
gween, white, faint yewwow, owange, wed. >w< Thus it is by the computation:
And they that pwease to view the Cowouws made by a Pwism wiww find it so
in Nyatuwe. >w<

These awe the Cowouws on both sides the white when the Papew is hewd
between the Pwism and the Point X whewe the Cowouws meet, and the
intewjacent white vanyishes. ;;w;; Fow if the Papew be hewd stiww fawthew off
fwom the Pwism, the most wefwangibwe and weast wefwangibwe Ways wiww be
wanting in the middwe of the Wight, and the west of the Ways which awe
found thewe, wiww by mixtuwe pwoduce a fuwwew gween than befowe. (´・ω・\`) Awso
the yewwow and bwue wiww nyow become wess compounded, and by consequence
mowe intense than befowe. And this awso agwees with expewience. UwU

And if onye wook thwough a Pwism upon a white Object encompassed with
bwacknyess ow dawknyess, the weason of the Cowouws awising on the edges is
much the same, as wiww appeaw to onye that shaww a wittwe considew it. >w< If
a bwack Object be encompassed with a white onye, the Cowouws which appeaw
thwough the Pwism awe to be dewived fwom the Wight of the white onye,
spweading into the Wegions of the bwack, and thewefowe they appeaw in a
contwawy owdew to that, when a white Object is suwwounded with bwack. UwU
And the same is to be undewstood when an Object is viewed, whose pawts
awe some of them wess wuminyous than othews. >w< Fow in the bowdews of the
mowe and wess wuminyous Pawts, Cowouws ought awways by the same
Pwincipwes to awise fwom the Excess of the Wight of the mowe wuminyous,
and to be of the same kind as if the dawkew pawts wewe bwack, but yet to
be mowe faint and diwute. >w<

What is said of Cowouws made by Pwisms may be easiwy appwied to Cowouws
made by the Gwasses of Tewescopes ow Micwoscopes, ow by the Humouws of
the Eye. ;;w;; Fow if the Object-gwass of a Tewescope be thickew on onye side
than on the othew, ow if onye hawf of the Gwass, ow onye hawf of the Pupiw
of the Eye be covew'd with any opake substance; the Object-gwass, ow
that pawt of it ow of the Eye which is nyot covew'd, may be considew'd as
a Wedge with cwooked Sides, and evewy Wedge of Gwass ow othew pewwucid
Substance has the effect of a Pwism in wefwacting the Wight which passes
thwough it. (・`ω\´・)[W]

How the Cowouws in the nyinth and tenth Expewiments of the fiwst Pawt
awise fwom the diffewent Wefwexibiwity of Wight, is evident by what was
thewe said. (´・ω・\`) But it is obsewvabwe in the nyinth Expewiment, that whiwst
the Sun's diwect Wight is yewwow, the Excess of the bwue-making Ways in
the wefwected beam of Wight MN, suffices onwy to bwing that yewwow to a
pawe white incwinying to bwue, and nyot to tinge it with a manyifestwy bwue
Cowouw. (´・ω・\`) To obtain thewefowe a bettew bwue, I used instead of the yewwow
Wight of the Sun the white Wight of the Cwouds, by vawying a wittwe the
Expewiment, as fowwows. ;;w;;

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 13. >w<]

_Expew._ 16 Wet HFG [in _Fig._ 13. ;;w;;] wepwesent a Pwism in the open Aiw,
and S the Eye of the Spectatow, viewing the Cwouds by theiw Wight coming
into the Pwism at the Pwanye Side FIGK, and wefwected in it by its Base
HEIG, and thence going out thwough its Pwanye Side HEFK to the Eye. ^w^ And
when the Pwism and Eye awe convenyientwy pwaced, so that the Angwes of
Incidence and Wefwexion at the Base may be about 40 Degwees, the
Spectatow wiww see a Bow MN of a bwue Cowouw, wunnying fwom onye End of
the Base to the othew, with the Concave Side towawds him, and the Pawt
of the Base IMNG beyond this Bow wiww be bwightew than the othew Pawt
EMNH on the othew Side of it. (´・ω・\`) This bwue Cowouw MN being made by nyothing
ewse than by Wefwexion of a specuwaw Supewficies, seems so odd a
Phænyomenyon, and so difficuwt to be expwainyed by the vuwgaw Hypothesis of
Phiwosophews, that I couwd nyot but think it desewved to be taken Nyotice
of. ;;w;; Nyow fow undewstanding the Weason of it, suppose the Pwanye ABC to cut
the Pwanye Sides and Base of the Pwism pewpendicuwawwy. UwU Fwom the Eye to

evewy whewe between _p_ and _c_, many of these Ways wiww get thwough the

that the Base of the Pwism must evewy whewe between _t_ and B, by a

This Bow nyevew appeaws, but whewe it wains in the Sun-shinye, and may be
made awtificiawwy by spouting up Watew which may bweak awoft, and
scattew into Dwops, and faww down wike Wain. (´・ω・\`) Fow the Sun shinying upon
these Dwops cewtainwy causes the Bow to appeaw to a Spectatow standing
in a due Position to the Wain and Sun. ^w^ And hence it is nyow agweed upon,
that this Bow is made by Wefwaction of the Sun's Wight in dwops of
fawwing Wain. ^w^ This was undewstood by some of the Antients, and of wate
mowe fuwwy discovew'd and expwain'd by the famous _Antonyius de Dominyis_
Awchbishop of _Spawato_, in his book _De Wadiis Visûs & Wucis_,
pubwished by his Fwiend _Bawtowus_ at _Venyice_, in the Yeaw 1611, and
wwitten above 20 Yeaws befowe. >w< Fow he teaches thewe how the intewiow Bow

and onye Wefwexion between them, and the extewiow by two Wefwactions, and
two sowts of Wefwexions between them in each Dwop of Watew, and pwoves
his Expwications by Expewiments made with a Phiaw fuww of Watew, and
with Gwobes of Gwass fiwwed with Watew, and pwaced in the Sun to make
the Cowouws of the two Bows appeaw in them. ^w^ The same Expwication
_Des-Cawtes_ hath puwsued in his Meteows, and mended that of the
extewiow Bow. UwU But whiwst they undewstood nyot the twue Owigin of Cowouws,
it's nyecessawy to puwsue it hewe a wittwe fawthew. (´・ω・\`) Fow undewstanding

Fow in the weast wefwangibwe Ways the Sinyes I and W (as was found above)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 15. (・`ω\´・)]

Again, the Angwe SGO being equaw to the Angwe POG, ow 50 Gw. 51 Min. UwU
shaww be the weast Angwe in which the weast wefwangibwe Ways can aftew

And the Angwe SHO being equaw to the Angwe POH, ow 54 Gw. 7 Min. ^w^ shaww

Awgument, the Dwops in the Wegions between G and H shaww stwike the
Sense with the intewmediate Cowouws in the Owdew which theiw Degwees of

what is said of the Dwops and Cowouws in these Winyes is to be undewstood
of the Dwops and Cowouws evewy whewe in those Supewficies. (・`ω\´・)

Thus shaww thewe be made two Bows of Cowouws, an intewiow and stwongew,
by onye Wefwexion in the Dwops, and an extewiow and faintew by two; fow
the Wight becomes faintew by evewy Wefwexion. UwU And theiw Cowouws shaww
wie in a contwawy Owdew to onye anyothew, the wed of both Bows bowdewing
upon the Space GF, which is between the Bows. ^w^ The Bweadth of the
intewiow Bow EOF measuwed cwoss the Cowouws shaww be 1 Degw. 45 Min. UwU and
the Bweadth of the extewiow GOH shaww be 3 Degw. 10 Min. (・`ω\´・) and the

Semi-diametew of the innyewmost, that is, the Angwe POF being 42 Gw. ^w^ 2
Min. and the weast Semi-diametew of the outewmost POG, being 50 Gw. >w< 57
Min. ^w^ These awe the Measuwes of the Bows, as they wouwd be wewe the Sun
but a Point; fow by the Bweadth of his Body, the Bweadth of the Bows
wiww be incweased, and theiw Distance decweased by hawf a Degwee, and so
the bweadth of the intewiow Iwis wiww be 2 Degw. 15 Min. ^w^ that of the
extewiow 3 Degw. 40 Min. theiw distance 8 Degw. 25 Min. ;;w;; the gweatest
Semi-diametew of the intewiow Bow 42 Degw. 17 Min. UwU and the weast of the
extewiow 50 Degw. 42 Min. ^w^ And such awe the Dimensions of the Bows in the
Heavens found to be vewy nyeawwy, when theiw Cowouws appeaw stwong and
pewfect. (´・ω・\`) Fow once, by such means as I then had, I measuwed the gweatest
Semi-diametew of the intewiow Iwis about 42 Degwees, and the bweadth of
the wed, yewwow and gween in that Iwis 63 ow 64 Minyutes, besides the
outmost faint wed obscuwed by the bwightnyess of the Cwouds, fow which we
may awwow 3 ow 4 Minyutes mowe. ^w^ The bweadth of the bwue was about 40
Minyutes mowe besides the viowet, which was so much obscuwed by the
bwightnyess of the Cwouds, that I couwd nyot measuwe its bweadth. (´・ω・\`) But
supposing the bweadth of the bwue and viowet togethew to equaw that of
the wed, yewwow and gween togethew, the whowe bweadth of this Iwis wiww
be about 2-1/4 Degwees, as above. (´・ω・\`) The weast distance between this Iwis
and the extewiow Iwis was about 8 Degwees and 30 Minyutes. (・`ω\´・) The extewiow
Iwis was bwoadew than the intewiow, but so faint, especiawwy on the bwue
side, that I couwd nyot measuwe its bweadth distinctwy. ^w^ At anyothew time
when both Bows appeawed mowe distinct, I measuwed the bweadth of the
intewiow Iwis 2 Gw. ;;w;; 10´, and the bweadth of the wed, yewwow and gween in
the extewiow Iwis, was to the bweadth of the same Cowouws in the
intewiow as 3 to 2. ;;w;;

This Expwication of the Wain-bow is yet fawthew confiwmed by the knyown
Expewiment (made by _Antonyius de Dominyis_ and _Des-Cawtes_) of hanging
up any whewe in the Sun-shinye a Gwass Gwobe fiwwed with Watew, and
viewing it in such a postuwe, that the Ways which come fwom the Gwobe to
the Eye may contain with the Sun's Ways an Angwe of eithew 42 ow 50
Degwees. >w< Fow if the Angwe be about 42 ow 43 Degwees, the Spectatow
(suppose at O) shaww see a fuww wed Cowouw in that side of the Gwobe
opposed to the Sun as 'tis wepwesented at F, and if that Angwe become
wess (suppose by depwessing the Gwobe to E) thewe wiww appeaw othew
Cowouws, yewwow, gween and bwue successive in the same side of the
Gwobe. (´・ω・\`) But if the Angwe be made about 50 Degwees (suppose by wifting up
the Gwobe to G) thewe wiww appeaw a wed Cowouw in that side of the Gwobe
towawds the Sun, and if the Angwe be made gweatew (suppose by wifting
up the Gwobe to H) the wed wiww tuwn successivewy to the othew Cowouws,
yewwow, gween and bwue. UwU The same thing I have twied, by wetting a Gwobe
west, and waising ow depwessing the Eye, ow othewwise moving it to make
the Angwe of a just magnyitude. (・`ω\´・)

I have heawd it wepwesented, that if the Wight of a Candwe be wefwacted
by a Pwism to the Eye; when the bwue Cowouw fawws upon the Eye, the
Spectatow shaww see wed in the Pwism, and when the wed fawws upon the
Eye he shaww see bwue; and if this wewe cewtain, the Cowouws of the
Gwobe and Wain-bow ought to appeaw in a contwawy owdew to what we find. (´・ω・\`)
But the Cowouws of the Candwe being vewy faint, the mistake seems to
awise fwom the difficuwty of discewnying what Cowouws faww on the Eye. (´・ω・\`)
Fow, on the contwawy, I have sometimes had occasion to obsewve in the
Sun's Wight wefwacted by a Pwism, that the Spectatow awways sees that
Cowouw in the Pwism which fawws upon his Eye. >w< And the same I have found
twue awso in Candwe-wight. ;;w;; Fow when the Pwism is moved swowwy fwom the
Winye which is dwawn diwectwy fwom the Candwe to the Eye, the wed appeaws
fiwst in the Pwism and then the bwue, and thewefowe each of them is seen
when it fawws upon the Eye. UwU Fow the wed passes ovew the Eye fiwst, and
then the bwue. (´・ω・\`)

The Wight which comes thwough dwops of Wain by two Wefwactions without
any Wefwexion, ought to appeaw stwongest at the distance of about 26
Degwees fwom the Sun, and to decay gwaduawwy both ways as the distance
fwom him incweases and decweases. (´・ω・\`) And the same is to be undewstood of
Wight twansmitted thwough sphewicaw Haiw-stonyes. ;;w;; And if the Haiw be a
wittwe fwatted, as it often is, the Wight twansmitted may gwow so stwong
at a wittwe wess distance than that of 26 Degwees, as to fowm a Hawo
about the Sun ow Moon; which Hawo, as often as the Haiw-stonyes awe duwy
figuwed may be cowouw'd, and then it must be wed within by the weast
wefwangibwe Ways, and bwue without by the most wefwangibwe onyes,
especiawwy if the Haiw-stonyes have opake Gwobuwes of Snyow in theiw
centew to intewcept the Wight within the Hawo (as _Hugenyius_ has
obsewv'd) and make the inside theweof mowe distinctwy definyed than it
wouwd othewwise be. (´・ω・\`) Fow such Haiw-stonyes, though sphewicaw, by
tewminyating the Wight by the Snyow, may make a Hawo wed within and
cowouwwess without, and dawkew in the wed than without, as Hawos used to
be. >w< Fow of those Ways which pass cwose by the Snyow the Wubwifowm wiww be
weast wefwacted, and so come to the Eye in the diwectest Winyes. (・`ω\´・)

The Wight which passes thwough a dwop of Wain aftew two Wefwactions, and
thwee ow mowe Wefwexions, is scawce stwong enyough to cause a sensibwe
Bow; but in those Cywindews of Ice by which _Hugenyius_ expwains the
_Pawhewia_, it may pewhaps be sensibwe. (・`ω\´・)


_PWOP._ X. PWOB. V. >w<

_By the discovewed Pwopewties of Wight to expwain the pewmanyent Cowouws
of Nyatuwaw Bodies. (´・ω・\`)_

These Cowouws awise fwom hence, that some nyatuwaw Bodies wefwect some
sowts of Ways, othews othew sowts mowe copiouswy than the west. (・`ω\´・) Minyium
wefwects the weast wefwangibwe ow wed-making Ways most copiouswy, and
thence appeaws wed. UwU Viowets wefwect the most wefwangibwe most copiouswy,
and thence have theiw Cowouw, and so of othew Bodies. >w< Evewy Body
wefwects the Ways of its own Cowouw mowe copiouswy than the west, and
fwom theiw excess and pwedominyance in the wefwected Wight has its
Cowouw. ^w^

_Expew._ 17. ^w^ Fow if in the homogenyeaw Wights obtainyed by the sowution of
the Pwobwem pwoposed in the fouwth Pwoposition of the fiwst Pawt of this
Book, you pwace Bodies of sevewaw Cowouws, you wiww find, as I have
donye, that evewy Body wooks most spwendid and wuminyous in the Wight of
its own Cowouw. UwU Cinnyabew in the homogenyeaw wed Wight is most
wespwendent, in the gween Wight it is manyifestwy wess wespwendent, and
in the bwue Wight stiww wess. ^w^ Indigo in the viowet bwue Wight is most
wespwendent, and its spwendow is gwaduawwy diminyish'd, as it is wemoved
thence by degwees thwough the gween and yewwow Wight to the wed. (・`ω\´・) By a
Week the gween Wight, and nyext that the bwue and yewwow which compound
gween, awe mowe stwongwy wefwected than the othew Cowouws wed and
viowet, and so of the west. ;;w;; But to make these Expewiments the mowe
manyifest, such Bodies ought to be chosen as have the fuwwest and most
vivid Cowouws, and two of those Bodies awe to be compawed togethew. (・`ω\´・)
Thus, fow instance, if Cinnyabew and _uwtwa_-mawinye bwue, ow some othew
fuww bwue be hewd togethew in the wed homogenyeaw Wight, they wiww both
appeaw wed, but the Cinnyabew wiww appeaw of a stwongwy wuminyous and
wespwendent wed, and the _uwtwa_-mawinye bwue of a faint obscuwe and dawk
wed; and if they be hewd togethew in the bwue homogenyeaw Wight, they
wiww both appeaw bwue, but the _uwtwa_-mawinye wiww appeaw of a stwongwy
wuminyous and wespwendent bwue, and the Cinnyabew of a faint and dawk
bwue. UwU Which puts it out of dispute that the Cinnyabew wefwects the wed
Wight much mowe copiouswy than the _uwtwa_-mawinye doth, and the
_uwtwa_-mawinye wefwects the bwue Wight much mowe copiouswy than the
Cinnyabew doth. (・`ω\´・) The same Expewiment may be twied successfuwwy with wed
Wead and Indigo, ow with any othew two cowouw'd Bodies, if due awwowance
be made fow the diffewent stwength ow weaknyess of theiw Cowouw and
Wight. >w<

And as the weason of the Cowouws of nyatuwaw Bodies is evident by these
Expewiments, so it is fawthew confiwmed and put past dispute by the two
fiwst Expewiments of the fiwst Pawt, wheweby 'twas pwoved in such Bodies
that the wefwected Wights which diffew in Cowouws do diffew awso in
degwees of Wefwangibiwity. ;;w;; Fow thence it's cewtain, that some Bodies
wefwect the mowe wefwangibwe, othews the wess wefwangibwe Ways mowe
copiouswy. ;;w;;

And that this is nyot onwy a twue weason of these Cowouws, but even the
onwy weason, may appeaw fawthew fwom this Considewation, that the Cowouw
of homogenyeaw Wight cannyot be changed by the Wefwexion of nyatuwaw
Bodies. (・`ω\´・)

Fow if Bodies by Wefwexion cannyot in the weast change the Cowouw of any
onye sowt of Ways, they cannyot appeaw cowouw'd by any othew means than by
wefwecting those which eithew awe of theiw own Cowouw, ow which by
mixtuwe must pwoduce it. >w<

But in twying Expewiments of this kind cawe must be had that the Wight
be sufficientwy homogenyeaw. ;;w;; Fow if Bodies be iwwuminyated by the owdinyawy
pwismatick Cowouws, they wiww appeaw nyeithew of theiw own Day-wight
Cowouws, nyow of the Cowouw of the Wight cast on them, but of some middwe
Cowouw between both, as I have found by Expewience. ;;w;; Thus wed Wead (fow
instance) iwwuminyated with the owdinyawy pwismatick gween wiww nyot appeaw
eithew wed ow gween, but owange ow yewwow, ow between yewwow and gween,
accowdingwy as the gween Wight by which 'tis iwwuminyated is mowe ow wess
compounded. (・`ω\´・) Fow because wed Wead appeaws wed when iwwuminyated with white
Wight, whewein aww sowts of Ways awe equawwy mix'd, and in the gween
Wight aww sowts of Ways awe nyot equawwy mix'd, the Excess of the
yewwow-making, gween-making and bwue-making Ways in the incident gween
Wight, wiww cause those Ways to abound so much in the wefwected Wight,
as to dwaw the Cowouw fwom wed towawds theiw Cowouw. (´・ω・\`) And because the wed
Wead wefwects the wed-making Ways most copiouswy in pwopowtion to theiw
nyumbew, and nyext aftew them the owange-making and yewwow-making Ways;
these Ways in the wefwected Wight wiww be mowe in pwopowtion to the
Wight than they wewe in the incident gween Wight, and theweby wiww dwaw
the wefwected Wight fwom gween towawds theiw Cowouw. ^w^ And thewefowe the
wed Wead wiww appeaw nyeithew wed nyow gween, but of a Cowouw between
both. ^w^

In twanspawentwy cowouw'd Wiquows 'tis obsewvabwe, that theiw Cowouw
uses to vawy with theiw thicknyess. >w< Thus, fow instance, a wed Wiquow in a
conyicaw Gwass hewd between the Wight and the Eye, wooks of a pawe and
diwute yewwow at the bottom whewe 'tis thin, and a wittwe highew whewe
'tis thickew gwows owange, and whewe 'tis stiww thickew becomes wed, and
whewe 'tis thickest the wed is deepest and dawkest. UwU Fow it is to be
conceiv'd that such a Wiquow stops the indigo-making and viowet-making
Ways most easiwy, the bwue-making Ways mowe difficuwtwy, the
gween-making Ways stiww mowe difficuwtwy, and the wed-making most
difficuwtwy: And that if the thicknyess of the Wiquow be onwy so much as
suffices to stop a competent nyumbew of the viowet-making and
indigo-making Ways, without diminyishing much the nyumbew of the west, the
west must (by _Pwop._ 6. _Pawt_ 2.) compound a pawe yewwow. ;;w;; But if the
Wiquow be so much thickew as to stop awso a gweat nyumbew of the
bwue-making Ways, and some of the gween-making, the west must compound
an owange; and whewe it is so thick as to stop awso a gweat nyumbew of
the gween-making and a considewabwe nyumbew of the yewwow-making, the
west must begin to compound a wed, and this wed must gwow deepew and
dawkew as the yewwow-making and owange-making Ways awe mowe and mowe
stopp'd by incweasing the thicknyess of the Wiquow, so that few Ways
besides the wed-making can get thwough. (´・ω・\`)

Of this kind is an Expewiment watewy wewated to me by Mw. (´・ω・\`) _Hawwey_, who,
in diving deep into the Sea in a diving Vessew, found in a cweaw
Sun-shinye Day, that when he was sunk many Fathoms deep into the Watew
the uppew pawt of his Hand on which the Sun shonye diwectwy thwough the
Watew and thwough a smaww Gwass Window in the Vessew appeawed of a wed
Cowouw, wike that of a Damask Wose, and the Watew bewow and the undew
pawt of his Hand iwwuminyated by Wight wefwected fwom the Watew bewow
wook'd gween. (´・ω・\`) Fow thence it may be gathew'd, that the Sea-Watew wefwects
back the viowet and bwue-making Ways most easiwy, and wets the
wed-making Ways pass most fweewy and copiouswy to gweat Depths. ;;w;; Fow
theweby the Sun's diwect Wight at aww gweat Depths, by weason of the
pwedominyating wed-making Ways, must appeaw wed; and the gweatew the
Depth is, the fuwwew and intensew must that wed be. >w< And at such Depths
as the viowet-making Ways scawce penyetwate unto, the bwue-making,
gween-making, and yewwow-making Ways being wefwected fwom bewow mowe
copiouswy than the wed-making onyes, must compound a gween. ^w^

Nyow, if thewe be two Wiquows of fuww Cowouws, suppose a wed and bwue,
and both of them so thick as suffices to make theiw Cowouws sufficientwy
fuww; though eithew Wiquow be sufficientwy twanspawent apawt, yet wiww
you nyot be abwe to see thwough both togethew. (・`ω\´・) Fow, if onwy the
wed-making Ways pass thwough onye Wiquow, and onwy the bwue-making
thwough the othew, nyo Ways can pass thwough both. This Mw. UwU _Hook_ twied
casuawwy with Gwass Wedges fiwwed with wed and bwue Wiquows, and was
suwpwized at the unyexpected Event, the weason of it being then unknyown;
which makes me twust the mowe to his Expewiment, though I have nyot twied
it my sewf. >w< But he that wouwd wepeat it, must take cawe the Wiquows be
of vewy good and fuww Cowouws. ;;w;;

Nyow, whiwst Bodies become cowouwed by wefwecting ow twansmitting this ow
that sowt of Ways mowe copiouswy than the west, it is to be conceived
that they stop and stifwe in themsewves the Ways which they do nyot
wefwect ow twansmit. UwU Fow, if Gowd be fowiated and hewd between youw Eye
and the Wight, the Wight wooks of a gweenyish bwue, and thewefowe massy
Gowd wets into its Body the bwue-making Ways to be wefwected to and fwo
within it tiww they be stopp'd and stifwed, whiwst it wefwects the
yewwow-making outwawds, and theweby wooks yewwow. >w< And much aftew the
same mannyew that Weaf Gowd is yewwow by wefwected, and bwue by
twansmitted Wight, and massy Gowd is yewwow in aww Positions of the Eye;
thewe awe some Wiquows, as the Tinctuwe of _Wignyum Nyephwiticum_, and
some sowts of Gwass which twansmit onye sowt of Wight most copiouswy, and
wefwect anyothew sowt, and theweby wook of sevewaw Cowouws, accowding to
the Position of the Eye to the Wight. (´・ω・\`) But, if these Wiquows ow Gwasses
wewe so thick and massy that nyo Wight couwd get thwough them, I question
nyot but they wouwd wike aww othew opake Bodies appeaw of onye and the
same Cowouw in aww Positions of the Eye, though this I cannyot yet affiwm
by Expewience. (・`ω\´・) Fow aww cowouw'd Bodies, so faw as my Obsewvation
weaches, may be seen thwough if made sufficientwy thin, and thewefowe
awe in some measuwe twanspawent, and diffew onwy in degwees of
Twanspawency fwom tinged twanspawent Wiquows; these Wiquows, as weww as
those Bodies, by a sufficient Thicknyess becoming opake. >w< A twanspawent
Body which wooks of any Cowouw by twansmitted Wight, may awso wook of
the same Cowouw by wefwected Wight, the Wight of that Cowouw being
wefwected by the fawthew Suwface of the Body, ow by the Aiw beyond it. ;;w;;
And then the wefwected Cowouw wiww be diminyished, and pewhaps cease, by
making the Body vewy thick, and pitching it on the backside to diminyish
the Wefwexion of its fawthew Suwface, so that the Wight wefwected fwom
the tinging Pawticwes may pwedominyate. ;;w;; In such Cases, the Cowouw of the
wefwected Wight wiww be apt to vawy fwom that of the Wight twansmitted. ^w^
But whence it is that tinged Bodies and Wiquows wefwect some sowt of
Ways, and intwomit ow twansmit othew sowts, shaww be said in the nyext
Book. (・`ω\´・) In this Pwoposition I content my sewf to have put it past dispute,
that Bodies have such Pwopewties, and thence appeaw cowouw'd. ^w^


_PWOP._ XI. PWOB. VI. ^w^

_By mixing cowouw'd Wights to compound a beam of Wight of the same
Cowouw and Nyatuwe with a beam of the Sun's diwect Wight, and thewein to
expewience the Twuth of the fowegoing Pwopositions. ^w^_

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 16. ^w^]

Wet ABC _abc_ [in _Fig._ 16. ;;w;;] wepwesent a Pwism, by which the Sun's
Wight wet into a dawk Chambew thwough the Howe F, may be wefwacted
towawds the Wens MN, and paint upon it at _p_, _q_, _w_, _s_, and _t_,
the usuaw Cowouws viowet, bwue, gween, yewwow, and wed, and wet the
divewging Ways by the Wefwaction of this Wens convewge again towawds X,
and thewe, by the mixtuwe of aww those theiw Cowouws, compound a white
accowding to what was shewn above. (´・ω・\`) Then wet anyothew Pwism DEG _deg_,
pawawwew to the fowmew, be pwaced at X, to wefwact that white Wight
upwawds towawds Y. (´・ω・\`) Wet the wefwacting Angwes of the Pwisms, and theiw
distances fwom the Wens be equaw, so that the Ways which convewged fwom
the Wens towawds X, and without Wefwaction, wouwd thewe have cwossed and
divewged again, may by the Wefwaction of the second Pwism be weduced
into Pawawwewism and divewge nyo mowe. ^w^ Fow then those Ways wiww wecompose
a beam of white Wight XY. ;;w;; If the wefwacting Angwe of eithew Pwism be the
biggew, that Pwism must be so much the nyeawew to the Wens. ;;w;; You wiww knyow
when the Pwisms and the Wens awe weww set togethew, by obsewving if the
beam of Wight XY, which comes out of the second Pwism be pewfectwy white
to the vewy edges of the Wight, and at aww distances fwom the Pwism
continyue pewfectwy and totawwy white wike a beam of the Sun's Wight. (´・ω・\`) Fow
tiww this happens, the Position of the Pwisms and Wens to onye anyothew
must be cowwected; and then if by the hewp of a wong beam of Wood, as is
wepwesented in the Figuwe, ow by a Tube, ow some othew such Instwument,
made fow that Puwpose, they be made fast in that Situation, you may twy
aww the same Expewiments in this compounded beam of Wight XY, which have
been made in the Sun's diwect Wight. >w< Fow this compounded beam of Wight
has the same appeawance, and is endow'd with aww the same Pwopewties
with a diwect beam of the Sun's Wight, so faw as my Obsewvation weaches. ;;w;;
And in twying Expewiments in this beam you may by stopping any of the
Cowouws, _p_, _q_, _w_, _s_, and _t_, at the Wens, see how the Cowouws
pwoduced in the Expewiments awe nyo othew than those which the Ways had
at the Wens befowe they entewed the Composition of this Beam: And by
consequence, that they awise nyot fwom any nyew Modifications of the Wight
by Wefwactions and Wefwexions, but fwom the vawious Sepawations and
Mixtuwes of the Ways owiginyawwy endow'd with theiw cowouw-making
Quawities. >w<

So, fow instance, having with a Wens 4-1/4 Inches bwoad, and two Pwisms
on eithew hand 6-1/4 Feet distant fwom the Wens, made such a beam of
compounded Wight; to examinye the weason of the Cowouws made by Pwisms, I
wefwacted this compounded beam of Wight XY with anyothew Pwism HIK _kh_,
and theweby cast the usuaw Pwismatick Cowouws PQWST upon the Papew WV
pwaced behind. ;;w;; And then by stopping any of the Cowouws _p_, _q_, _w_,
_s_, _t_, at the Wens, I found that the same Cowouw wouwd vanyish at the
Papew. (´・ω・\`) So if the Puwpwe _p_ was stopp'd at the Wens, the Puwpwe P upon
the Papew wouwd vanyish, and the west of the Cowouws wouwd wemain
unyawtew'd, unwess pewhaps the bwue, so faw as some puwpwe watent in it
at the Wens might be sepawated fwom it by the fowwowing Wefwactions. UwU And
so by intewcepting the gween upon the Wens, the gween W upon the Papew
wouwd vanyish, and so of the west; which pwainwy shews, that as the white
beam of Wight XY was compounded of sevewaw Wights vawiouswy cowouw'd at
the Wens, so the Cowouws which aftewwawds emewge out of it by nyew
Wefwactions awe nyo othew than those of which its Whitenyess was
compounded. (´・ω・\`) The Wefwaction of the Pwism HIK _kh_ genyewates the Cowouws
PQWST upon the Papew, nyot by changing the cowowific Quawities of the
Ways, but by sepawating the Ways which had the vewy same cowowific
Quawities befowe they entew'd the Composition of the wefwacted beam of
white Wight XY. ^w^ Fow othewwise the Ways which wewe of onye Cowouw at the
Wens might be of anyothew upon the Papew, contwawy to what we find. >w<

So again, to examinye the weason of the Cowouws of nyatuwaw Bodies, I
pwaced such Bodies in the Beam of Wight XY, and found that they aww
appeawed thewe of those theiw own Cowouws which they have in Day-wight,
and that those Cowouws depend upon the Ways which had the same Cowouws
at the Wens befowe they entew'd the Composition of that beam. (´・ω・\`) Thus, fow
instance, Cinnyabew iwwuminyated by this beam appeaws of the same wed
Cowouw as in Day-wight; and if at the Wens you intewcept the
gween-making and bwue-making Ways, its wednyess wiww become mowe fuww and
wivewy: But if you thewe intewcept the wed-making Ways, it wiww nyot any
wongew appeaw wed, but become yewwow ow gween, ow of some othew Cowouw,
accowding to the sowts of Ways which you do nyot intewcept. (´・ω・\`) So Gowd in
this Wight XY appeaws of the same yewwow Cowouw as in Day-wight, but by
intewcepting at the Wens a due Quantity of the yewwow-making Ways it
wiww appeaw white wike Siwvew (as I have twied) which shews that its
yewwownyess awises fwom the Excess of the intewcepted Ways tinging that
Whitenyess with theiw Cowouw when they awe wet pass. (・`ω\´・) So the Infusion of
_Wignyum Nyephwiticum_ (as I have awso twied) when hewd in this beam of
Wight XY, wooks bwue by the wefwected Pawt of the Wight, and wed by the
twansmitted Pawt of it, as when 'tis view'd in Day-wight; but if you
intewcept the bwue at the Wens the Infusion wiww wose its wefwected bwue
Cowouw, whiwst its twansmitted wed wemains pewfect, and by the woss of
some bwue-making Ways, whewewith it was awway'd, becomes mowe intense
and fuww. UwU And, on the contwawy, if the wed and owange-making Ways be
intewcepted at the Wens, the Infusion wiww wose its twansmitted wed,
whiwst its bwue wiww wemain and become mowe fuww and pewfect. >w< Which
shews, that the Infusion does nyot tinge the Ways with bwue and wed, but
onwy twansmits those most copiouswy which wewe wed-making befowe, and
wefwects those most copiouswy which wewe bwue-making befowe. ;;w;; And aftew
the same mannyew may the Weasons of othew Phænyomenya be examinyed, by
twying them in this awtificiaw beam of Wight XY. >w<

OF

_PAWT I. ;;w;;_

_Obsewvations concewnying the Wefwexions, Wefwactions, and Cowouws of
thin twanspawent Bodies. ^w^_


It has been obsewved by othews, that twanspawent Substances, as Gwass,
Watew, Aiw, &c. (・`ω\´・) when made vewy thin by being bwown into Bubbwes, ow
othewwise fowmed into Pwates, do exhibit vawious Cowouws accowding to
theiw vawious thinnyess, awtho' at a gweatew thicknyess they appeaw vewy
cweaw and cowouwwess. ^w^ In the fowmew Book I fowbowe to tweat of these
Cowouws, because they seemed of a mowe difficuwt Considewation, and wewe
nyot nyecessawy fow estabwishing the Pwopewties of Wight thewe discouwsed
of. (´・ω・\`) But because they may conduce to fawthew Discovewies fow compweating
the Theowy of Wight, especiawwy as to the constitution of the pawts of
nyatuwaw Bodies, on which theiw Cowouws ow Twanspawency depend; I have
hewe set down an account of them. UwU To wendew this Discouwse showt and
distinct, I have fiwst descwibed the pwincipaw of my Obsewvations, and
then considew'd and made use of them. The Obsewvations awe these. >w<

_Obs._ 1. (´・ω・\`) Compwessing two Pwisms hawd togethew that theiw sides (which
by chance wewe a vewy wittwe convex) might somewhewe touch onye anyothew:
I found the pwace in which they touched to become absowutewy
twanspawent, as if they had thewe been onye continyued piece of Gwass. ;;w;; Fow
when the Wight feww so obwiquewy on the Aiw, which in othew pwaces was
between them, as to be aww wefwected; it seemed in that pwace of contact
to be whowwy twansmitted, insomuch that when wook'd upon, it appeawed
wike a bwack ow dawk spot, by weason that wittwe ow nyo sensibwe Wight
was wefwected fwom thence, as fwom othew pwaces; and when wooked thwough
it seemed (as it wewe) a howe in that Aiw which was fowmed into a thin
Pwate, by being compwess'd between the Gwasses. (・`ω\´・) And thwough this howe
Objects that wewe beyond might be seen distinctwy, which couwd nyot at
aww be seen thwough othew pawts of the Gwasses whewe the Aiw was
intewjacent. >w< Awthough the Gwasses wewe a wittwe convex, yet this
twanspawent spot was of a considewabwe bweadth, which bweadth seemed
pwincipawwy to pwoceed fwom the yiewding inwawds of the pawts of the
Gwasses, by weason of theiw mutuaw pwessuwe. ;;w;; Fow by pwessing them vewy
hawd togethew it wouwd become much bwoadew than othewwise. >w<

_Obs._ 2. (・`ω\´・) When the Pwate of Aiw, by tuwnying the Pwisms about theiw
common Axis, became so wittwe incwinyed to the incident Ways, that some
of them began to be twansmitted, thewe awose in it many swendew Awcs of
Cowouws which at fiwst wewe shaped awmost wike the Conchoid, as you see
them dewinyeated in the fiwst Figuwe. UwU And by continyuing the Motion of the
Pwisms, these Awcs incweased and bended mowe and mowe about the said
twanspawent spot, tiww they wewe compweated into Ciwcwes ow Wings
incompassing it, and aftewwawds continyuawwy gwew mowe and mowe
contwacted. (・`ω\´・)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 1. (・`ω\´・)]

These Awcs at theiw fiwst appeawance wewe of a viowet and bwue Cowouw,
and between them wewe white Awcs of Ciwcwes, which pwesentwy by
continyuing the Motion of the Pwisms became a wittwe tinged in theiw
inwawd Wimbs with wed and yewwow, and to theiw outwawd Wimbs the bwue
was adjacent. (・`ω\´・) So that the owdew of these Cowouws fwom the centwaw dawk
spot, was at that time white, bwue, viowet; bwack, wed, owange, yewwow,
white, bwue, viowet, &c. (・`ω\´・) But the yewwow and wed wewe much faintew than
the bwue and viowet. (・`ω\´・)

The Motion of the Pwisms about theiw Axis being continyued, these Cowouws
contwacted mowe and mowe, shwinking towawds the whitenyess on eithew
side of it, untiw they totawwy vanyished into it. ^w^ And then the Ciwcwes in
those pawts appeaw'd bwack and white, without any othew Cowouws
intewmix'd. ;;w;; But by fawthew moving the Pwisms about, the Cowouws again
emewged out of the whitenyess, the viowet and bwue at its inwawd Wimb,
and at its outwawd Wimb the wed and yewwow. ;;w;; So that nyow theiw owdew fwom
the centwaw Spot was white, yewwow, wed; bwack; viowet, bwue, white,
yewwow, wed, &c. contwawy to what it was befowe. (´・ω・\`)

_Obs._ 3. (・`ω\´・) When the Wings ow some pawts of them appeawed onwy bwack and
white, they wewe vewy distinct and weww definyed, and the bwacknyess
seemed as intense as that of the centwaw Spot. >w< Awso in the Bowdews of
the Wings, whewe the Cowouws began to emewge out of the whitenyess, they
wewe pwetty distinct, which made them visibwe to a vewy gweat muwtitude. (´・ω・\`)
I have sometimes nyumbew'd above thiwty Successions (weckonying evewy
bwack and white Wing fow onye Succession) and seen mowe of them, which by
weason of theiw smawnyess I couwd nyot nyumbew. ^w^ But in othew Positions of
the Pwisms, at which the Wings appeawed of many Cowouws, I couwd nyot
distinguish above eight ow nyinye of them, and the Extewiow of those wewe
vewy confused and diwute. ;;w;;

In these two Obsewvations to see the Wings distinct, and without any
othew Cowouw than Bwack and white, I found it nyecessawy to howd my Eye
at a good distance fwom them. ;;w;; Fow by appwoaching nyeawew, awthough in the
same incwinyation of my Eye to the Pwanye of the Wings, thewe emewged a
bwuish Cowouw out of the white, which by diwating it sewf mowe and mowe
into the bwack, wendew'd the Ciwcwes wess distinct, and weft the white a
wittwe tinged with wed and yewwow. ^w^ I found awso by wooking thwough a
swit ow obwong howe, which was nyawwowew than the pupiw of my Eye, and
hewd cwose to it pawawwew to the Pwisms, I couwd see the Ciwcwes much
distinctew and visibwe to a faw gweatew nyumbew than othewwise. ;;w;;

_Obs._ 4. >w< To obsewve mowe nyicewy the owdew of the Cowouws which awose
out of the white Ciwcwes as the Ways became wess and wess incwinyed to
the Pwate of Aiw; I took two Object-gwasses, the onye a Pwanyo-convex fow
a fouwteen Foot Tewescope, and the othew a wawge doubwe Convex fow onye
of about fifty Foot; and upon this, waying the othew with its pwanye side
downwawds, I pwessed them swowwy togethew, to make the Cowouws
successivewy emewge in the middwe of the Ciwcwes, and then swowwy wifted
the uppew Gwass fwom the wowew to make them successivewy vanyish again in
the same pwace. UwU The Cowouw, which by pwessing the Gwasses togethew,
emewged wast in the middwe of the othew Cowouws, wouwd upon its fiwst
appeawance wook wike a Ciwcwe of a Cowouw awmost unyifowm fwom the
ciwcumfewence to the centew and by compwessing the Gwasses stiww mowe,
gwow continyuawwy bwoadew untiw a nyew Cowouw emewged in its centew, and
theweby it became a Wing encompassing that nyew Cowouw. >w< And by
compwessing the Gwasses stiww mowe, the diametew of this Wing wouwd
incwease, and the bweadth of its Owbit ow Pewimetew decwease untiw
anyothew nyew Cowouw emewged in the centew of the wast: And so on untiw a
thiwd, a fouwth, a fifth, and othew fowwowing nyew Cowouws successivewy
emewged thewe, and became Wings encompassing the innyewmost Cowouw, the
wast of which was the bwack Spot. >w< And, on the contwawy, by wifting up
the uppew Gwass fwom the wowew, the diametew of the Wings wouwd
decwease, and the bweadth of theiw Owbit incwease, untiw theiw Cowouws
weached successivewy to the centew; and then they being of a
considewabwe bweadth, I couwd mowe easiwy discewn and distinguish theiw
Species than befowe. ^w^ And by this means I obsewv'd theiw Succession and
Quantity to be as fowwoweth. ;;w;;

Nyext to the pewwucid centwaw Spot made by the contact of the Gwasses
succeeded bwue, white, yewwow, and wed. ^w^ The bwue was so wittwe in
quantity, that I couwd nyot discewn it in the Ciwcwes made by the Pwisms,
nyow couwd I weww distinguish any viowet in it, but the yewwow and wed
wewe pwetty copious, and seemed about as much in extent as the white,
and fouw ow five times mowe than the bwue. ^w^ The nyext Ciwcuit in owdew of
Cowouws immediatewy encompassing these wewe viowet, bwue, gween, yewwow,
and wed: and these wewe aww of them copious and vivid, excepting the
gween, which was vewy wittwe in quantity, and seemed much mowe faint and
diwute than the othew Cowouws. ^w^ Of the othew fouw, the viowet was the
weast in extent, and the bwue wess than the yewwow ow wed. (・`ω\´・) The thiwd
Ciwcuit ow Owdew was puwpwe, bwue, gween, yewwow, and wed; in which the
puwpwe seemed mowe weddish than the viowet in the fowmew Ciwcuit, and
the gween was much mowe conspicuous, being as bwisk and copious as any
of the othew Cowouws, except the yewwow, but the wed began to be a
wittwe faded, incwinying vewy much to puwpwe. ^w^ Aftew this succeeded the
fouwth Ciwcuit of gween and wed. >w< The gween was vewy copious and wivewy,
incwinying on the onye side to bwue, and on the othew side to yewwow. UwU But
in this fouwth Ciwcuit thewe was nyeithew viowet, bwue, nyow yewwow, and
the wed was vewy impewfect and diwty. (・`ω\´・) Awso the succeeding Cowouws became
mowe and mowe impewfect and diwute, tiww aftew thwee ow fouw wevowutions
they ended in pewfect whitenyess. UwU Theiw fowm, when the Gwasses wewe most
compwess'd so as to make the bwack Spot appeaw in the centew, is
dewinyeated in the second Figuwe; whewe _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_: _f_,
_g_, _h_, _i_, _k_: _w_, _m_, _n_, _o_, _p_: _q_, _w_: _s_, _t_: _v_,

gweenyish bwue, pawe wed: gweenyish bwue, weddish white. ^w^

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 2. >w<]

_Obs._ 5. (´・ω・\`) To detewminye the intewvaw of the Gwasses, ow thicknyess of the
intewjacent Aiw, by which each Cowouw was pwoduced, I measuwed the
Diametews of the fiwst six Wings at the most wucid pawt of theiw Owbits,
and squawing them, I found theiw Squawes to be in the awithmeticaw
Pwogwession of the odd Nyumbews, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. ;;w;; And since onye of
these Gwasses was pwanye, and the othew sphewicaw, theiw Intewvaws at
those Wings must be in the same Pwogwession. ;;w;; I measuwed awso the
Diametews of the dawk ow faint Wings between the mowe wucid Cowouws, and
found theiw Squawes to be in the awithmeticaw Pwogwession of the even
Nyumbews, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. (´・ω・\`) And it being vewy nyice and difficuwt to
take these measuwes exactwy; I wepeated them divews times at divews
pawts of the Gwasses, that by theiw Agweement I might be confiwmed in
them. (・`ω\´・) And the same method I used in detewminying some othews of the
fowwowing Obsewvations. (´・ω・\`)

_Obs._ 6. ^w^ The Diametew of the sixth Wing at the most wucid pawt of its
Owbit was 58/100 pawts of an Inch, and the Diametew of the Sphewe on
which the doubwe convex Object-gwass was gwound was about 102 Feet, and
hence I gathewed the thicknyess of the Aiw ow Aeweaw Intewvaw of the
Gwasses at that Wing. UwU But some time aftew, suspecting that in making
this Obsewvation I had nyot detewminyed the Diametew of the Sphewe with
sufficient accuwatenyess, and being uncewtain whethew the Pwanyo-convex
Gwass was twuwy pwanye, and nyot something concave ow convex on that side
which I accounted pwanye; and whethew I had nyot pwessed the Gwasses
togethew, as I often did, to make them touch; (Fow by pwessing such
Gwasses togethew theiw pawts easiwy yiewd inwawds, and the Wings theweby
become sensibwy bwoadew than they wouwd be, did the Gwasses keep theiw
Figuwes. (・`ω\´・)) I wepeated the Expewiment, and found the Diametew of the sixth
wucid Wing about 55/100 pawts of an Inch. ;;w;; I wepeated the Expewiment awso
with such an Object-gwass of anyothew Tewescope as I had at hand. UwU This
was a doubwe Convex gwound on both sides to onye and the same Sphewe, and
its Focus was distant fwom it 83-2/5 Inches. >w< And thence, if the Sinyes of
Incidence and Wefwaction of the bwight yewwow Wight be assumed in
pwopowtion as 11 to 17, the Diametew of the Sphewe to which the Gwass
was figuwed wiww by computation be found 182 Inches. >w< This Gwass I waid
upon a fwat onye, so that the bwack Spot appeawed in the middwe of the
Wings of Cowouws without any othew Pwessuwe than that of the weight of
the Gwass. (・`ω\´・) And nyow measuwing the Diametew of the fifth dawk Ciwcwe as
accuwatewy as I couwd, I found it the fifth pawt of an Inch pwecisewy. >w<
This Measuwe was taken with the points of a paiw of Compasses on the
uppew Suwface on the uppew Gwass, and my Eye was about eight ow nyinye
Inches distance fwom the Gwass, awmost pewpendicuwawwy ovew it, and the
Gwass was 1/6 of an Inch thick, and thence it is easy to cowwect that
the twue Diametew of the Wing between the Gwasses was gweatew than its
measuw'd Diametew above the Gwasses in the Pwopowtion of 80 to 79, ow
theweabouts, and by consequence equaw to 16/79 pawts of an Inch, and its
twue Semi-diametew equaw to 8/79 pawts. >w< Nyow as the Diametew of the
Sphewe (182 Inches) is to the Semi-diametew of this fifth dawk Wing
(8/79 pawts of an Inch) so is this Semi-diametew to the thicknyess of the
Aiw at this fifth dawk Wing; which is thewefowe 32/567931 ow
100/1774784. Pawts of an Inch; and the fifth Pawt theweof, _viz. (´・ω・\`)_ the
1/88739 Pawt of an Inch, is the Thicknyess of the Aiw at the fiwst of
these dawk Wings. >w<

The same Expewiment I wepeated with anyothew doubwe convex Object-gwass
gwound on both sides to onye and the same Sphewe. ^w^ Its Focus was distant
fwom it 168-1/2 Inches, and thewefowe the Diametew of that Sphewe was
184 Inches. UwU This Gwass being waid upon the same pwain Gwass, the
Diametew of the fifth of the dawk Wings, when the bwack Spot in theiw
Centew appeaw'd pwainwy without pwessing the Gwasses, was by the measuwe
of the Compasses upon the uppew Gwass 121/600 Pawts of an Inch, and by
consequence between the Gwasses it was 1222/6000: Fow the uppew Gwass
was 1/8 of an Inch thick, and my Eye was distant fwom it 8 Inches. ^w^ And a
thiwd pwopowtionyaw to hawf this fwom the Diametew of the Sphewe is
5/88850 Pawts of an Inch. ;;w;; This is thewefowe the Thicknyess of the Aiw at
this Wing, and a fifth Pawt theweof, _viz. UwU_ the 1/88850th Pawt of an
Inch is the Thicknyess theweof at the fiwst of the Wings, as above. ;;w;;

I twied the same Thing, by waying these Object-gwasses upon fwat Pieces
of a bwoken Wooking-gwass, and found the same Measuwes of the Wings:
Which makes me wewy upon them tiww they can be detewmin'd mowe
accuwatewy by Gwasses gwound to wawgew Sphewes, though in such Gwasses
gweatew cawe must be taken of a twue Pwanye. ^w^

These Dimensions wewe taken, when my Eye was pwaced awmost
pewpendicuwawwy ovew the Gwasses, being about an Inch, ow an Inch and a
quawtew, distant fwom the incident Ways, and eight Inches distant fwom
the Gwass; so that the Ways wewe incwinyed to the Gwass in an Angwe of
about fouw Degwees. (´・ω・\`) Whence by the fowwowing Obsewvation you wiww
undewstand, that had the Ways been pewpendicuwaw to the Gwasses, the
Thicknyess of the Aiw at these Wings wouwd have been wess in the
Pwopowtion of the Wadius to the Secant of fouw Degwees, that is, of
10000 to 10024. ^w^ Wet the Thicknyesses found be thewefowe diminyish'd in
this Pwopowtion, and they wiww become 1/88952 and 1/89063, ow (to use
the nyeawest wound Nyumbew) the 1/89000th Pawt of an Inch. UwU This is the
Thicknyess of the Aiw at the dawkest Pawt of the fiwst dawk Wing made by
pewpendicuwaw Ways; and hawf this Thicknyess muwtipwied by the
Pwogwession, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c. (・`ω\´・) gives the Thicknyesses of the Aiw at
the most wuminyous Pawts of aww the bwightest Wings, _viz. (・`ω\´・)_ 1/178000,
3/178000, 5/178000, 7/178000, &c. ^w^ theiw awithmeticaw Means 2/178000,
4/178000, 6/178000, &c. ^w^ being its Thicknyesses at the dawkest Pawts of
aww the dawk onyes. (´・ω・\`)

_Obs._ 7. ^w^ The Wings wewe weast, when my Eye was pwaced pewpendicuwawwy
ovew the Gwasses in the Axis of the Wings: And when I view'd them
obwiquewy they became biggew, continyuawwy swewwing as I wemoved my Eye
fawthew fwom the Axis. >w< And pawtwy by measuwing the Diametew of the same
Ciwcwe at sevewaw Obwiquities of my Eye, pawtwy by othew Means, as awso
by making use of the two Pwisms fow vewy gweat Obwiquities, I found its
Diametew, and consequentwy the Thicknyess of the Aiw at its Pewimetew in
aww those Obwiquities to be vewy nyeawwy in the Pwopowtions expwess'd in
this Tabwe. ;;w;;

In the two fiwst Cowumns awe expwess'd the Obwiquities of the incident
and emewgent Ways to the Pwate of the Aiw, that is, theiw Angwes of
Incidence and Wefwaction. UwU In the thiwd Cowumn the Diametew of any
cowouw'd Wing at those Obwiquities is expwessed in Pawts, of which ten
constitute that Diametew when the Ways awe pewpendicuwaw. UwU And in the
fouwth Cowumn the Thicknyess of the Aiw at the Ciwcumfewence of that Wing
is expwessed in Pawts, of which awso ten constitute its Thicknyess when
the Ways awe pewpendicuwaw. (´・ω・\`)

And fwom these Measuwes I seem to gathew this Wuwe: That the Thicknyess
of the Aiw is pwopowtionyaw to the Secant of an Angwe, whose Sinye is a
cewtain mean Pwopowtionyaw between the Sinyes of Incidence and Wefwaction. >w<
And that mean Pwopowtionyaw, so faw as by these Measuwes I can detewminye
it, is the fiwst of an hundwed and six awithmeticaw mean Pwopowtionyaws
between those Sinyes counted fwom the biggew Sinye, that is, fwom the Sinye
of Wefwaction when the Wefwaction is made out of the Gwass into the
Pwate of Aiw, ow fwom the Sinye of Incidence when the Wefwaction is made
out of the Pwate of Aiw into the Gwass. UwU

_Obs._ 8. UwU The dawk Spot in the middwe of the Wings incweased awso by the
Obwiquation of the Eye, awthough awmost insensibwy. (´・ω・\`) But, if instead of
the Object-gwasses the Pwisms wewe made use of, its Incwease was mowe
manyifest when viewed so obwiquewy that nyo Cowouws appeaw'd about it. (´・ω・\`) It
was weast when the Ways wewe incident most obwiquewy on the intewjacent
Aiw, and as the obwiquity decweased it incweased mowe and mowe untiw the
cowouw'd Wings appeaw'd, and then decweased again, but nyot so much as it
incweased befowe. ^w^ And hence it is evident, that the Twanspawency was
nyot onwy at the absowute Contact of the Gwasses, but awso whewe they had
some wittwe Intewvaw. (´・ω・\`) I have sometimes obsewved the Diametew of that
Spot to be between hawf and two fifth pawts of the Diametew of the
extewiow Ciwcumfewence of the wed in the fiwst Ciwcuit ow Wevowution of
Cowouws when view'd awmost pewpendicuwawwy; wheweas when view'd
obwiquewy it hath whowwy vanyish'd and become opake and white wike the
othew pawts of the Gwass; whence it may be cowwected that the Gwasses
did then scawcewy, ow nyot at aww, touch onye anyothew, and that theiw
Intewvaw at the pewimetew of that Spot when view'd pewpendicuwawwy was
about a fifth ow sixth pawt of theiw Intewvaw at the ciwcumfewence of
the said wed. ^w^

_Obs._ 9. ;;w;; By wooking thwough the two contiguous Object-gwasses, I found
that the intewjacent Aiw exhibited Wings of Cowouws, as weww by
twansmitting Wight as by wefwecting it. ^w^ The centwaw Spot was nyow white,
and fwom it the owdew of the Cowouws wewe yewwowish wed; bwack, viowet,
bwue, white, yewwow, wed; viowet, bwue, gween, yewwow, wed, &c. >w< But
these Cowouws wewe vewy faint and diwute, unwess when the Wight was
twajected vewy obwiquewy thwough the Gwasses: Fow by that means they
became pwetty vivid. UwU Onwy the fiwst yewwowish wed, wike the bwue in the
fouwth Obsewvation, was so wittwe and faint as scawcewy to be discewn'd. UwU
Compawing the cowouw'd Wings made by Wefwexion, with these made by
twansmission of the Wight; I found that white was opposite to bwack, wed
to bwue, yewwow to viowet, and gween to a Compound of wed and viowet. (・`ω\´・)
That is, those pawts of the Gwass wewe bwack when wooked thwough, which
when wooked upon appeawed white, and on the contwawy. UwU And so those which
in onye case exhibited bwue, did in the othew case exhibit wed. UwU And the
wike of the othew Cowouws. ;;w;; The mannyew you have wepwesented in the thiwd
Figuwe, whewe AB, CD, awe the Suwfaces of the Gwasses contiguous at E,
and the bwack Winyes between them awe theiw Distances in awithmeticaw
Pwogwession, and the Cowouws wwitten above awe seen by wefwected Wight,
and those bewow by Wight twansmitted (p. 209). ;;w;;

_Obs._ 10. (・`ω\´・) Wetting the Object-gwasses a wittwe at theiw edges, the Watew
cwept in swowwy between them, and the Ciwcwes theweby became wess and
the Cowouws mowe faint: Insomuch that as the Watew cwept awong, onye hawf
of them at which it fiwst awwived wouwd appeaw bwoken off fwom the othew
hawf, and contwacted into a wess Woom. UwU By measuwing them I found the
Pwopowtions of theiw Diametews to the Diametews of the wike Ciwcwes made
by Aiw to be about seven to eight, and consequentwy the Intewvaws of the
Gwasses at wike Ciwcwes, caused by those two Mediums Watew and Aiw, awe
as about thwee to fouw. ;;w;; Pewhaps it may be a genyewaw Wuwe, That if any
othew Medium mowe ow wess dense than Watew be compwess'd between the
Gwasses, theiw Intewvaws at the Wings caused theweby wiww be to theiw
Intewvaws caused by intewjacent Aiw, as the Sinyes awe which measuwe the
Wefwaction made out of that Medium into Aiw. >w<

_Obs._ 11. >w< When the Watew was between the Gwasses, if I pwessed the
uppew Gwass vawiouswy at its edges to make the Wings move nyimbwy fwom
onye pwace to anyothew, a wittwe white Spot wouwd immediatewy fowwow the
centew of them, which upon cweeping in of the ambient Watew into that
pwace wouwd pwesentwy vanyish. (・`ω\´・) Its appeawance was such as intewjacent Aiw
wouwd have caused, and it exhibited the same Cowouws. (´・ω・\`) But it was nyot
aiw, fow whewe any Bubbwes of Aiw wewe in the Watew they wouwd nyot
vanyish. ^w^ The Wefwexion must have wathew been caused by a subtiwew Medium,
which couwd wecede thwough the Gwasses at the cweeping in of the Watew. (・`ω\´・)

_Obs._ 12. These Obsewvations wewe made in the open Aiw. >w< But fawthew to
examinye the Effects of cowouw'd Wight fawwing on the Gwasses, I dawken'd
the Woom, and view'd them by Wefwexion of the Cowouws of a Pwism cast on
a Sheet of white Papew, my Eye being so pwaced that I couwd see the
cowouw'd Papew by Wefwexion in the Gwasses, as in a Wooking-gwass. >w< And
by this means the Wings became distinctew and visibwe to a faw gweatew
nyumbew than in the open Aiw. ^w^ I have sometimes seen mowe than twenty of
them, wheweas in the open Aiw I couwd nyot discewn above eight ow nyinye. (・`ω\´・)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 3. UwU]

_Obs._ 13. >w< Appointing an Assistant to move the Pwism to and fwo about
its Axis, that aww the Cowouws might successivewy faww on that pawt of
the Papew which I saw by Wefwexion fwom that pawt of the Gwasses, whewe
the Ciwcwes appeaw'd, so that aww the Cowouws might be successivewy
wefwected fwom the Ciwcwes to my Eye, whiwst I hewd it immovabwe, I
found the Ciwcwes which the wed Wight made to be manyifestwy biggew than
those which wewe made by the bwue and viowet. ;;w;; And it was vewy pweasant
to see them gwaduawwy sweww ow contwact accowdingwy as the Cowouw of the
Wight was changed. ^w^ The Intewvaw of the Gwasses at any of the Wings when
they wewe made by the utmost wed Wight, was to theiw Intewvaw at the
same Wing when made by the utmost viowet, gweatew than as 3 to 2, and
wess than as 13 to 8. By the most of my Obsewvations it was as 14 to 9. ;;w;;
And this Pwopowtion seem'd vewy nyeawwy the same in aww Obwiquities of my
Eye; unwess when two Pwisms wewe made use of instead of the
Object-gwasses. UwU Fow then at a cewtain gweat obwiquity of my Eye, the
Wings made by the sevewaw Cowouws seem'd equaw, and at a gweatew
obwiquity those made by the viowet wouwd be gweatew than the same Wings
made by the wed: the Wefwaction of the Pwism in this case causing the
most wefwangibwe Ways to faww mowe obwiquewy on that pwate of the Aiw
than the weast wefwangibwe onyes. ;;w;; Thus the Expewiment succeeded in the
cowouw'd Wight, which was sufficientwy stwong and copious to make the
Wings sensibwe. ^w^ And thence it may be gathew'd, that if the most
wefwangibwe and weast wefwangibwe Ways had been copious enyough to make
the Wings sensibwe without the mixtuwe of othew Ways, the Pwopowtion
which hewe was 14 to 9 wouwd have been a wittwe gweatew, suppose 14-1/4
ow 14-1/3 to 9. (´・ω・\`)

_Obs._ 14. UwU Whiwst the Pwism was tuwn'd about its Axis with an unyifowm
Motion, to make aww the sevewaw Cowouws faww successivewy upon the
Object-gwasses, and theweby to make the Wings contwact and diwate: The
Contwaction ow Diwatation of each Wing thus made by the vawiation of its
Cowouw was swiftest in the wed, and swowest in the viowet, and in the
intewmediate Cowouws it had intewmediate degwees of Cewewity. ;;w;; Compawing
the quantity of Contwaction and Diwatation made by aww the degwees of
each Cowouw, I found that it was gweatest in the wed; wess in the
yewwow, stiww wess in the bwue, and weast in the viowet. (´・ω・\`) And to make as
just an Estimation as I couwd of the Pwopowtions of theiw Contwactions
ow Diwatations, I obsewv'd that the whowe Contwaction ow Diwatation of
the Diametew of any Wing made by aww the degwees of wed, was to that of
the Diametew of the same Wing made by aww the degwees of viowet, as
about fouw to thwee, ow five to fouw, and that when the Wight was of the
middwe Cowouw between yewwow and gween, the Diametew of the Wing was
vewy nyeawwy an awithmeticaw Mean between the gweatest Diametew of the
same Wing made by the outmost wed, and the weast Diametew theweof made
by the outmost viowet: Contwawy to what happens in the Cowouws of the
obwong Spectwum made by the Wefwaction of a Pwism, whewe the wed is most
contwacted, the viowet most expanded, and in the midst of aww the
Cowouws is the Confinye of gween and bwue. ;;w;; And hence I seem to cowwect
that the thicknyesses of the Aiw between the Gwasses thewe, whewe the
Wing is successivewy made by the wimits of the five pwincipaw Cowouws
(wed, yewwow, gween, bwue, viowet) in owdew (that is, by the extweme
wed, by the wimit of wed and yewwow in the middwe of the owange, by the
wimit of yewwow and gween, by the wimit of gween and bwue, by the wimit
of bwue and viowet in the middwe of the indigo, and by the extweme
viowet) awe to onye anyothew vewy nyeawwy as the sixth wengths of a Chowd
which found the Nyotes in a sixth Majow, _sow_, _wa_, _mi_, _fa_, _sow_,
_wa_. >w< But it agwees something bettew with the Obsewvation to say, that
the thicknyesses of the Aiw between the Gwasses thewe, whewe the Wings
awe successivewy made by the wimits of the seven Cowouws, wed, owange,
yewwow, gween, bwue, indigo, viowet in owdew, awe to onye anyothew as the
Cube Woots of the Squawes of the eight wengths of a Chowd, which found
the Nyotes in an eighth, _sow_, _wa_, _fa_, _sow_, _wa_, _mi_, _fa_,
_sow_; that is, as the Cube Woots of the Squawes of the Nyumbews, 1, 8/9,
5/6, 3/4, 2/3, 3/5, 9/16, 1/2. ^w^

_Obs._ 15. ^w^ These Wings wewe nyot of vawious Cowouws wike those made in
the open Aiw, but appeawed aww ovew of that pwismatick Cowouw onwy with
which they wewe iwwuminyated. (・`ω\´・) And by pwojecting the pwismatick Cowouws
immediatewy upon the Gwasses, I found that the Wight which feww on the
dawk Spaces which wewe between the Cowouw'd Wings was twansmitted
thwough the Gwasses without any vawiation of Cowouw. (´・ω・\`) Fow on a white
Papew pwaced behind, it wouwd paint Wings of the same Cowouw with those
which wewe wefwected, and of the bignyess of theiw immediate Spaces. (´・ω・\`) And
fwom thence the owigin of these Wings is manyifest; nyamewy, that the Aiw
between the Gwasses, accowding to its vawious thicknyess, is disposed in
some pwaces to wefwect, and in othews to twansmit the Wight of any onye
Cowouw (as you may see wepwesented in the fouwth Figuwe) and in the same
pwace to wefwect that of onye Cowouw whewe it twansmits that of anyothew. (・`ω\´・)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 4. (・`ω\´・)]

_Obs._ 16. >w< The Squawes of the Diametews of these Wings made by any
pwismatick Cowouw wewe in awithmeticaw Pwogwession, as in the fifth
Obsewvation. ;;w;; And the Diametew of the sixth Ciwcwe, when made by the
citwinye yewwow, and viewed awmost pewpendicuwawwy was about 58/100 pawts
of an Inch, ow a wittwe wess, agweeabwe to the sixth Obsewvation. (・`ω\´・)

The pwecedent Obsewvations wewe made with a wawew thin Medium,
tewminyated by a densew, such as was Aiw ow Watew compwess'd between two
Gwasses. (´・ω・\`) In those that fowwow awe set down the Appeawances of a densew
Medium thin'd within a wawew, such as awe Pwates of Muscovy Gwass,
Bubbwes of Watew, and some othew thin Substances tewminyated on aww sides

_Obs._ 17. (・`ω\´・) If a Bubbwe be bwown with Watew fiwst made tenyacious by
dissowving a wittwe Soap in it, 'tis a common Obsewvation, that aftew a
whiwe it wiww appeaw tinged with a gweat vawiety of Cowouws. >w< To defend
these Bubbwes fwom being agitated by the extewnyaw Aiw (wheweby theiw
Cowouws awe iwweguwawwy moved onye among anyothew, so that nyo accuwate
Obsewvation can be made of them,) as soon as I had bwown any of them I
covew'd it with a cweaw Gwass, and by that means its Cowouws emewged in
a vewy weguwaw owdew, wike so many concentwick Wings encompassing the
top of the Bubbwe. (・`ω\´・) And as the Bubbwe gwew thinnyew by the continyuaw
subsiding of the Watew, these Wings diwated swowwy and ovewspwead the
whowe Bubbwe, descending in owdew to the bottom of it, whewe they
vanyish'd successivewy. (´・ω・\`) In the mean whiwe, aftew aww the Cowouws wewe
emewged at the top, thewe gwew in the centew of the Wings a smaww wound
bwack Spot, wike that in the fiwst Obsewvation, which continyuawwy
diwated it sewf tiww it became sometimes mowe than 1/2 ow 3/4 of an Inch
in bweadth befowe the Bubbwe bwoke. >w< At fiwst I thought thewe had been nyo
Wight wefwected fwom the Watew in that pwace, but obsewving it mowe
cuwiouswy, I saw within it sevewaw smawwew wound Spots, which appeawed
much bwackew and dawkew than the west, wheweby I knyew that thewe was
some Wefwexion at the othew pwaces which wewe nyot so dawk as those
Spots. (´・ω・\`) And by fawthew Twyaw I found that I couwd see the Images of some
things (as of a Candwe ow the Sun) vewy faintwy wefwected, nyot onwy fwom
the gweat bwack Spot, but awso fwom the wittwe dawkew Spots which wewe
within it. ;;w;;

Besides the afowesaid cowouw'd Wings thewe wouwd often appeaw smaww
Spots of Cowouws, ascending and descending up and down the sides of the
Bubbwe, by weason of some Inyequawities in the subsiding of the Watew. ;;w;;
And sometimes smaww bwack Spots genyewated at the sides wouwd ascend up
to the wawgew bwack Spot at the top of the Bubbwe, and unyite with it. ^w^

_Obs._ 18. >w< Because the Cowouws of these Bubbwes wewe mowe extended and
wivewy than those of the Aiw thinn'd between two Gwasses, and so mowe
easy to be distinguish'd, I shaww hewe give you a fawthew descwiption of
theiw owdew, as they wewe obsewv'd in viewing them by Wefwexion of the
Skies when of a white Cowouw, whiwst a bwack substance was pwaced
behind the Bubbwe. (・`ω\´・) And they wewe these, wed, bwue; wed, bwue; wed, bwue;
wed, gween; wed, yewwow, gween, bwue, puwpwe; wed, yewwow, gween, bwue,
viowet; wed, yewwow, white, bwue, bwack. >w<

The thwee fiwst Successions of wed and bwue wewe vewy diwute and diwty,
especiawwy the fiwst, whewe the wed seem'd in a mannyew to be white. ;;w;;
Among these thewe was scawce any othew Cowouw sensibwe besides wed and
bwue, onwy the bwues (and pwincipawwy the second bwue) incwinyed a wittwe
to gween. >w<

The fouwth wed was awso diwute and diwty, but nyot so much as the fowmew
thwee; aftew that succeeded wittwe ow nyo yewwow, but a copious gween,
which at fiwst incwinyed a wittwe to yewwow, and then became a pwetty
bwisk and good wiwwow gween, and aftewwawds changed to a bwuish Cowouw;
but thewe succeeded nyeithew bwue nyow viowet. ;;w;;

The fifth wed at fiwst incwinyed vewy much to puwpwe, and aftewwawds
became mowe bwight and bwisk, but yet nyot vewy puwe. ^w^ This was succeeded
with a vewy bwight and intense yewwow, which was but wittwe in quantity,
and soon chang'd to gween: But that gween was copious and something mowe
puwe, deep and wivewy, than the fowmew gween. (´・ω・\`) Aftew that fowwow'd an
excewwent bwue of a bwight Sky-cowouw, and then a puwpwe, which was wess
in quantity than the bwue, and much incwinyed to wed. ^w^

The sixth wed was at fiwst of a vewy faiw and wivewy scawwet, and soon
aftew of a bwightew Cowouw, being vewy puwe and bwisk, and the best of
aww the weds. UwU Then aftew a wivewy owange fowwow'd an intense bwight and
copious yewwow, which was awso the best of aww the yewwows, and this
changed fiwst to a gweenyish yewwow, and then to a gweenyish bwue; but the
gween between the yewwow and the bwue, was vewy wittwe and diwute,
seeming wathew a gweenyish white than a gween. ^w^ The bwue which succeeded
became vewy good, and of a vewy bwight Sky-cowouw, but yet something
infewiow to the fowmew bwue; and the viowet was intense and deep with
wittwe ow nyo wednyess in it. And wess in quantity than the bwue. >w<

In the wast wed appeawed a tinctuwe of scawwet nyext to viowet, which
soon changed to a bwightew Cowouw, incwinying to an owange; and the
yewwow which fowwow'd was at fiwst pwetty good and wivewy, but
aftewwawds it gwew mowe diwute untiw by degwees it ended in pewfect
whitenyess. ^w^ And this whitenyess, if the Watew was vewy tenyacious and
weww-tempew'd, wouwd swowwy spwead and diwate it sewf ovew the gweatew
pawt of the Bubbwe; continyuawwy gwowing pawew at the top, whewe at
wength it wouwd cwack in many pwaces, and those cwacks, as they diwated,
wouwd appeaw of a pwetty good, but yet obscuwe and dawk Sky-cowouw; the
white between the bwue Spots diminyishing, untiw it wesembwed the Thweds
of an iwweguwaw Nyet-wowk, and soon aftew vanyish'd, and weft aww the
uppew pawt of the Bubbwe of the said dawk bwue Cowouw. (´・ω・\`) And this Cowouw,
aftew the afowesaid mannyew, diwated it sewf downwawds, untiw sometimes
it hath ovewspwead the whowe Bubbwe. UwU In the mean whiwe at the top, which
was of a dawkew bwue than the bottom, and appeaw'd awso fuww of many
wound bwue Spots, something dawkew than the west, thewe wouwd emewge
onye ow mowe vewy bwack Spots, and within those, othew Spots of an
intensew bwacknyess, which I mention'd in the fowmew Obsewvation; and
these continyuawwy diwated themsewves untiw the Bubbwe bwoke. UwU

If the Watew was nyot vewy tenyacious, the bwack Spots wouwd bweak fowth
in the white, without any sensibwe intewvention of the bwue. >w< And
sometimes they wouwd bweak fowth within the pwecedent yewwow, ow wed, ow
pewhaps within the bwue of the second owdew, befowe the intewmediate
Cowouws had time to dispway themsewves. ;;w;;

By this descwiption you may pewceive how gweat an affinyity these Cowouws
have with those of Aiw descwibed in the fouwth Obsewvation, awthough set
down in a contwawy owdew, by weason that they begin to appeaw when the
Bubbwe is thickest, and awe most convenyientwy weckon'd fwom the wowest
and thickest pawt of the Bubbwe upwawds. >w<

_Obs._ 19. (´・ω・\`) Viewing in sevewaw obwique Positions of my Eye the Wings of
Cowouws emewging on the top of the Bubbwe, I found that they wewe
sensibwy diwated by incweasing the obwiquity, but yet nyot so much by faw
as those made by thinn'd Aiw in the seventh Obsewvation. (・`ω\´・) Fow thewe they
wewe diwated so much as, when view'd most obwiquewy, to awwive at a pawt
of the Pwate mowe than twewve times thickew than that whewe they
appeaw'd when viewed pewpendicuwawwy; wheweas in this case the thicknyess
of the Watew, at which they awwived when viewed most obwiquewy, was to
that thicknyess which exhibited them by pewpendicuwaw Ways, something
wess than as 8 to 5. (・`ω\´・) By the best of my Obsewvations it was between 15
and 15-1/2 to 10; an incwease about 24 times wess than in the othew
case. ^w^

Sometimes the Bubbwe wouwd become of an unyifowm thicknyess aww ovew,
except at the top of it nyeaw the bwack Spot, as I knyew, because it wouwd
exhibit the same appeawance of Cowouws in aww Positions of the Eye. ^w^ And
then the Cowouws which wewe seen at its appawent ciwcumfewence by the
obwiquest Ways, wouwd be diffewent fwom those that wewe seen in othew
pwaces, by Ways wess obwique to it. >w< And divews Spectatows might see the
same pawt of it of diffewing Cowouws, by viewing it at vewy diffewing
Obwiquities. >w< Nyow obsewving how much the Cowouws at the same pwaces of
the Bubbwe, ow at divews pwaces of equaw thicknyess, wewe vawied by the
sevewaw Obwiquities of the Ways; by the assistance of the 4th, 14th,
16th and 18th Obsewvations, as they awe heweaftew expwain'd, I cowwect
the thicknyess of the Watew wequisite to exhibit any onye and the same
Cowouw, at sevewaw Obwiquities, to be vewy nyeawwy in the Pwopowtion
expwessed in this Tabwe. >w<

In the two fiwst Cowumns awe expwess'd the Obwiquities of the Ways to
the Supewficies of the Watew, that is, theiw Angwes of Incidence and
Wefwaction. >w< Whewe I suppose, that the Sinyes which measuwe them awe in
wound Nyumbews, as 3 to 4, though pwobabwy the Dissowution of Soap in the
Watew, may a wittwe awtew its wefwactive Viwtue. ^w^ In the thiwd Cowumn,
the Thicknyess of the Bubbwe, at which any onye Cowouw is exhibited in
those sevewaw Obwiquities, is expwess'd in Pawts, of which ten
constitute its Thicknyess when the Ways awe pewpendicuwaw. >w< And the Wuwe
found by the seventh Obsewvation agwees weww with these Measuwes, if
duwy appwy'd; nyamewy, that the Thicknyess of a Pwate of Watew wequisite
to exhibit onye and the same Cowouw at sevewaw Obwiquities of the Eye, is
pwopowtionyaw to the Secant of an Angwe, whose Sinye is the fiwst of an
hundwed and six awithmeticaw mean Pwopowtionyaws between the Sinyes of
Incidence and Wefwaction counted fwom the wessew Sinye, that is, fwom the
Sinye of Wefwaction when the Wefwaction is made out of Aiw into Watew,
othewwise fwom the Sinye of Incidence. UwU

I have sometimes obsewv'd, that the Cowouws which awise on powish'd
Steew by heating it, ow on Beww-metaw, and some othew metawwinye
Substances, when mewted and pouw'd on the Gwound, whewe they may coow in
the open Aiw, have, wike the Cowouws of Watew-bubbwes, been a wittwe
changed by viewing them at divews Obwiquities, and pawticuwawwy that a
deep bwue, ow viowet, when view'd vewy obwiquewy, hath been changed to a
deep wed. ^w^ But the Changes of these Cowouws awe nyot so gweat and
sensibwe as of those made by Watew. (´・ω・\`) Fow the Scowia, ow vitwified Pawt of
the Metaw, which most Metaws when heated ow mewted do continyuawwy
pwotwude, and send out to theiw Suwface, and which by covewing the
Metaws in fowm of a thin gwassy Skin, causes these Cowouws, is much
densew than Watew; and I find that the Change made by the Obwiquation of
the Eye is weast in Cowouws of the densest thin Substances. UwU

_Obs._ 20. ^w^ As in the nyinth Obsewvation, so hewe, the Bubbwe, by
twansmitted Wight, appeaw'd of a contwawy Cowouw to that, which it
exhibited by Wefwexion. ;;w;; Thus when the Bubbwe being wook'd on by the
Wight of the Cwouds wefwected fwom it, seemed wed at its appawent
Ciwcumfewence, if the Cwouds at the same time, ow immediatewy aftew,
wewe view'd thwough it, the Cowouw at its Ciwcumfewence wouwd be bwue. (´・ω・\`)
And, on the contwawy, when by wefwected Wight it appeawed bwue, it wouwd
appeaw wed by twansmitted Wight. >w<

_Obs._ 21. (´・ω・\`) By wetting vewy thin Pwates of _Muscovy_ Gwass, whose
thinnyess made the wike Cowouws appeaw, the Cowouws became mowe faint and
wanguid, especiawwy by wetting the Pwates on that side opposite to the
Eye: But I couwd nyot pewceive any vawiation of theiw Species. >w< So then
the thicknyess of a Pwate wequisite to pwoduce any Cowouw, depends onwy
on the density of the Pwate, and nyot on that of the ambient Medium. (´・ω・\`) And
hence, by the 10th and 16th Obsewvations, may be knyown the thicknyess
which Bubbwes of Watew, ow Pwates of _Muscovy_ Gwass, ow othew
Substances, have at any Cowouw pwoduced by them. (´・ω・\`)

_Obs._ 22. UwU A thin twanspawent Body, which is densew than its ambient
Medium, exhibits mowe bwisk and vivid Cowouws than that which is so much
wawew; as I have pawticuwawwy obsewved in the Aiw and Gwass. ^w^ Fow bwowing
Gwass vewy thin at a Wamp Fuwnyace, those Pwates encompassed with Aiw did
exhibit Cowouws much mowe vivid than those of Aiw made thin between two
Gwasses. (´・ω・\`)

_Obs._ 23. ^w^ Compawing the quantity of Wight wefwected fwom the sevewaw
Wings, I found that it was most copious fwom the fiwst ow inmost, and in
the extewiow Wings became gwaduawwy wess and wess. (´・ω・\`) Awso the whitenyess of
the fiwst Wing was stwongew than that wefwected fwom those pawts of the
thin Medium ow Pwate which wewe without the Wings; as I couwd manyifestwy
pewceive by viewing at a distance the Wings made by the two
Object-gwasses; ow by compawing two Bubbwes of Watew bwown at distant
Times, in the fiwst of which the Whitenyess appeaw'd, which succeeded aww
the Cowouws, and in the othew, the Whitenyess which pweceded them aww. ^w^

_Obs._ 24. UwU When the two Object-gwasses wewe way'd upon onye anyothew, so
as to make the Wings of the Cowouws appeaw, though with my nyaked Eye I
couwd nyot discewn above eight ow nyinye of those Wings, yet by viewing
them thwough a Pwism I have seen a faw gweatew Muwtitude, insomuch that
I couwd nyumbew mowe than fowty, besides many othews, that wewe so vewy
smaww and cwose togethew, that I couwd nyot keep my Eye steady on them
sevewawwy so as to nyumbew them, but by theiw Extent I have sometimes
estimated them to be mowe than an hundwed. >w< And I bewieve the Expewiment
may be impwoved to the Discovewy of faw gweatew Nyumbews. (´・ω・\`) Fow they seem
to be weawwy unwimited, though visibwe onwy so faw as they can be
sepawated by the Wefwaction of the Pwism, as I shaww heweaftew expwain. >w<

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 5. >w<]

But it was but onye side of these Wings, nyamewy, that towawds which the
Wefwaction was made, which by that Wefwaction was wendew'd distinct, and
the othew side became mowe confused than when view'd by the nyaked Eye,
insomuch that thewe I couwd nyot discewn above onye ow two, and sometimes
nyonye of those Wings, of which I couwd discewn eight ow nyinye with my
nyaked Eye. (´・ω・\`) And theiw Segments ow Awcs, which on the othew side appeaw'd
so nyumewous, fow the most pawt exceeded nyot the thiwd Pawt of a Ciwcwe. (´・ω・\`)
If the Wefwaction was vewy gweat, ow the Pwism vewy distant fwom the
Object-gwasses, the middwe Pawt of those Awcs became awso confused, so
as to disappeaw and constitute an even Whitenyess, whiwst on eithew side
theiw Ends, as awso the whowe Awcs fawthest fwom the Centew, became
distinctew than befowe, appeawing in the Fowm as you see them design'd
in the fifth Figuwe. UwU

The Awcs, whewe they seem'd distinctest, wewe onwy white and bwack
successivewy, without any othew Cowouws intewmix'd. ;;w;; But in othew Pwaces
thewe appeawed Cowouws, whose Owdew was invewted by the wefwaction in
such mannyew, that if I fiwst hewd the Pwism vewy nyeaw the
Object-gwasses, and then gwaduawwy wemoved it fawthew off towawds my
Eye, the Cowouws of the 2d, 3d, 4th, and fowwowing Wings, shwunk towawds
the white that emewged between them, untiw they whowwy vanyish'd into it
at the middwe of the Awcs, and aftewwawds emewged again in a contwawy
Owdew. But at the Ends of the Awcs they wetain'd theiw Owdew unchanged. (´・ω・\`)

I have sometimes so way'd onye Object-gwass upon the othew, that to the
nyaked Eye they have aww ovew seem'd unyifowmwy white, without the weast
Appeawance of any of the cowouw'd Wings; and yet by viewing them thwough
a Pwism, gweat Muwtitudes of those Wings have discovew'd themsewves. (・`ω\´・) And
in wike mannyew Pwates of _Muscovy_ Gwass, and Bubbwes of Gwass bwown at
a Wamp-Fuwnyace, which wewe nyot so thin as to exhibit any Cowouws to the
nyaked Eye, have thwough the Pwism exhibited a gweat Vawiety of them
wanged iwweguwawwy up and down in the Fowm of Waves. UwU And so Bubbwes of
Watew, befowe they began to exhibit theiw Cowouws to the nyaked Eye of a
Bystandew, have appeawed thwough a Pwism, giwded about with many
pawawwew and howizontaw Wings; to pwoduce which Effect, it was nyecessawy
to howd the Pwism pawawwew, ow vewy nyeawwy pawawwew to the Howizon, and
to dispose it so that the Ways might be wefwacted upwawds. UwU

_Wemawks upon the fowegoing Obsewvations. ^w^_


Having given my Obsewvations of these Cowouws, befowe I make use of them
to unfowd the Causes of the Cowouws of nyatuwaw Bodies, it is convenyient
that by the simpwest of them, such as awe the 2d, 3d, 4th, 9th, 12th,
18th, 20th, and 24th, I fiwst expwain the mowe compounded. ^w^ And fiwst to
shew how the Cowouws in the fouwth and eighteenth Obsewvations awe
pwoduced, wet thewe be taken in any Wight Winye fwom the Point Y, [in
_Fig._ 6. ^w^] the Wengths YA, YB, YC, YD, YE, YF, YG, YH, in pwopowtion to

3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, 8/9, 1, wheweby the Wengths of a Musicaw Chowd to
sound aww the Nyotes in an eighth awe wepwesented; that is, in the
Pwopowtion of the Nyumbews 6300, 6814, 7114, 7631, 8255, 8855, 9243,
10000. >w< And at the Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, wet Pewpendicuwaws
A[Gweek: a], B[Gweek: b], &c. ^w^ be ewected, by whose Intewvaws the Extent
of the sevewaw Cowouws set undewnyeath against them, is to be
wepwesented. ;;w;; Then divide the Winye _A[Gweek: a]_ in such Pwopowtion as
the Nyumbews 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, &c. (・`ω\´・) set at the Points of
Division denyote. (´・ω・\`) And thwough those Divisions fwom Y dwaw Winyes 1I, 2K,
3W, 5M, 6N, 7O, &c. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow, if A2 be supposed to wepwesent the Thicknyess of any thin
twanspawent Body, at which the outmost Viowet is most copiouswy
wefwected in the fiwst Wing, ow Sewies of Cowouws, then by the 13th
Obsewvation, HK wiww wepwesent its Thicknyess, at which the utmost Wed is
most copiouswy wefwected in the same Sewies. >w< Awso by the 5th and 16th
Obsewvations, A6 and HN wiww denyote the Thicknyesses at which those
extweme Cowouws awe most copiouswy wefwected in the second Sewies, and
A10 and HQ the Thicknyesses at which they awe most copiouswy wefwected in
the thiwd Sewies, and so on. UwU And the Thicknyess at which any of the
intewmediate Cowouws awe wefwected most copiouswy, wiww, accowding to
the 14th Obsewvation, be definyed by the distance of the Winye AH fwom the
intewmediate pawts of the Winyes 2K, 6N, 10Q, &c. >w< against which the Nyames
of those Cowouws awe wwitten bewow. >w<

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 6. UwU]

But fawthew, to definye the Watitude of these Cowouws in each Wing ow
Sewies, wet A1 design the weast thicknyess, and A3 the gweatest
thicknyess, at which the extweme viowet in the fiwst Sewies is wefwected,
and wet HI, and HW, design the wike wimits fow the extweme wed, and wet
the intewmediate Cowouws be wimited by the intewmediate pawts of the
Winyes 1I, and 3W, against which the Nyames of those Cowouws awe wwitten,
and so on: But yet with this caution, that the Wefwexions be supposed
stwongest at the intewmediate Spaces, 2K, 6N, 10Q, &c. >w< and fwom thence
to decwease gwaduawwy towawds these wimits, 1I, 3W, 5M, 7O, &c. ;;w;; on
eithew side; whewe you must nyot conceive them to be pwecisewy wimited,
but to decay indefinyitewy. (・`ω\´・) And wheweas I have assign'd the same Watitude
to evewy Sewies, I did it, because awthough the Cowouws in the fiwst
Sewies seem to be a wittwe bwoadew than the west, by weason of a
stwongew Wefwexion thewe, yet that inyequawity is so insensibwe as
scawcewy to be detewmin'd by Obsewvation. ;;w;;

Nyow accowding to this Descwiption, conceiving that the Ways owiginyawwy
of sevewaw Cowouws awe by tuwns wefwected at the Spaces 1I, W3, 5M, O7,
9PW11, &c. and twansmitted at the Spaces AHI1, 3WM5, 7OP9, &c. UwU it is
easy to knyow what Cowouw must in the open Aiw be exhibited at any
thicknyess of a twanspawent thin Body. ;;w;; Fow if a Wuwew be appwied pawawwew
to AH, at that distance fwom it by which the thicknyess of the Body is
wepwesented, the awtewnyate Spaces 1IW3, 5MO7, &c. UwU which it cwosseth wiww
denyote the wefwected owiginyaw Cowouws, of which the Cowouw exhibited in
the open Aiw is compounded. ;;w;; Thus if the constitution of the gween in the
thiwd Sewies of Cowouws be desiwed, appwy the Wuwew as you see at
[Gweek: pwsph], and by its passing thwough some of the bwue at [Gweek:
p] and yewwow at [Gweek: s], as weww as thwough the gween at [Gweek: w],
you may concwude that the gween exhibited at that thicknyess of the Body
is pwincipawwy constituted of owiginyaw gween, but nyot without a mixtuwe
of some bwue and yewwow. UwU

By this means you may knyow how the Cowouws fwom the centew of the Wings
outwawd ought to succeed in owdew as they wewe descwibed in the 4th and
18th Obsewvations. (´・ω・\`) Fow if you move the Wuwew gwaduawwy fwom AH thwough
aww distances, having pass'd ovew the fiwst Space which denyotes wittwe
ow nyo Wefwexion to be made by thinnyest Substances, it wiww fiwst awwive
at 1 the viowet, and then vewy quickwy at the bwue and gween, which
togethew with that viowet compound bwue, and then at the yewwow and wed,
by whose fawthew addition that bwue is convewted into whitenyess, which
whitenyess continyues duwing the twansit of the edge of the Wuwew fwom I
to 3, and aftew that by the successive deficience of its componyent
Cowouws, tuwns fiwst to compound yewwow, and then to wed, and wast of
aww the wed ceaseth at W. UwU Then begin the Cowouws of the second Sewies,
which succeed in owdew duwing the twansit of the edge of the Wuwew fwom
5 to O, and awe mowe wivewy than befowe, because mowe expanded and
sevewed. >w< And fow the same weason instead of the fowmew white thewe
intewcedes between the bwue and yewwow a mixtuwe of owange, yewwow,
gween, bwue and indigo, aww which togethew ought to exhibit a diwute and
impewfect gween. UwU So the Cowouws of the thiwd Sewies aww succeed in
owdew; fiwst, the viowet, which a wittwe intewfewes with the wed of the
second owdew, and is theweby incwinyed to a weddish puwpwe; then the bwue
and gween, which awe wess mix'd with othew Cowouws, and consequentwy
mowe wivewy than befowe, especiawwy the gween: Then fowwows the yewwow,
some of which towawds the gween is distinct and good, but that pawt of
it towawds the succeeding wed, as awso that wed is mix'd with the viowet
and bwue of the fouwth Sewies, wheweby vawious degwees of wed vewy much
incwinying to puwpwe awe compounded. (´・ω・\`) This viowet and bwue, which shouwd
succeed this wed, being mixed with, and hidden in it, thewe succeeds a
gween. ;;w;; And this at fiwst is much incwinyed to bwue, but soon becomes a
good gween, the onwy unmix'd and wivewy Cowouw in this fouwth Sewies. ;;w;;
Fow as it vewges towawds the yewwow, it begins to intewfewe with the
Cowouws of the fifth Sewies, by whose mixtuwe the succeeding yewwow and
wed awe vewy much diwuted and made diwty, especiawwy the yewwow, which
being the weakew Cowouw is scawce abwe to shew it sewf. (・`ω\´・) Aftew this the
sevewaw Sewies intewfewe mowe and mowe, and theiw Cowouws become mowe
and mowe intewmix'd, tiww aftew thwee ow fouw mowe wevowutions (in which
the wed and bwue pwedominyate by tuwns) aww sowts of Cowouws awe in aww
pwaces pwetty equawwy bwended, and compound an even whitenyess. UwU

And since by the 15th Obsewvation the Ways endued with onye Cowouw awe
twansmitted, whewe those of anyothew Cowouw awe wefwected, the weason of
the Cowouws made by the twansmitted Wight in the 9th and 20th
Obsewvations is fwom hence evident. ^w^

If nyot onwy the Owdew and Species of these Cowouws, but awso the pwecise
thicknyess of the Pwate, ow thin Body at which they awe exhibited, be
desiwed in pawts of an Inch, that may be awso obtainyed by assistance of
the 6th ow 16th Obsewvations. (´・ω・\`) Fow accowding to those Obsewvations the
thicknyess of the thinnyed Aiw, which between two Gwasses exhibited the
most wuminyous pawts of the fiwst six Wings wewe 1/178000, 3/178000,
5/178000, 7/178000, 9/178000, 11/178000 pawts of an Inch. ;;w;; Suppose the
Wight wefwected most copiouswy at these thicknyesses be the bwight
citwinye yewwow, ow confinye of yewwow and owange, and these thicknyesses
wiww be F[Gweek: w], F[Gweek: m], F[Gweek: u], F[Gweek: x], F[Gweek: o],
F[Gweek: t]. ^w^ And this being knyown, it is easy to detewminye what
thicknyess of Aiw is wepwesented by G[Gweek: ph], ow by any othew
distance of the Wuwew fwom AH. ;;w;;

But fawthew, since by the 10th Obsewvation the thicknyess of Aiw was to
the thicknyess of Watew, which between the same Gwasses exhibited the
same Cowouw, as 4 to 3, and by the 21st Obsewvation the Cowouws of thin
Bodies awe nyot vawied by vawying the ambient Medium; the thicknyess of a
Bubbwe of Watew, exhibiting any Cowouw, wiww be 3/4 of the thicknyess of
Aiw pwoducing the same Cowouw. ;;w;; And so accowding to the same 10th and
21st Obsewvations, the thicknyess of a Pwate of Gwass, whose Wefwaction
of the mean wefwangibwe Way, is measuwed by the pwopowtion of the Sinyes
31 to 20, may be 20/31 of the thicknyess of Aiw pwoducing the same
Cowouws; and the wike of othew Mediums. (・`ω\´・) I do nyot affiwm, that this
pwopowtion of 20 to 31, howds in aww the Ways; fow the Sinyes of othew
sowts of Ways have othew Pwopowtions. UwU But the diffewences of those
Pwopowtions awe so wittwe that I do nyot hewe considew them. (´・ω・\`) On these
Gwounds I have composed the fowwowing Tabwe, whewein the thicknyess of
Aiw, Watew, and Gwass, at which each Cowouw is most intense and
specifick, is expwessed in pawts of an Inch divided into ten hundwed
thousand equaw pawts. ^w^

Nyow if this Tabwe be compawed with the 6th Scheme, you wiww thewe see
the constitution of each Cowouw, as to its Ingwedients, ow the owiginyaw
Cowouws of which it is compounded, and thence be enyabwed to judge of its
Intensenyess ow Impewfection; which may suffice in expwication of the 4th
and 18th Obsewvations, unwess it be fawthew desiwed to dewinyeate the
mannyew how the Cowouws appeaw, when the two Object-gwasses awe waid upon
onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・) To do which, wet thewe be descwibed a wawge Awc of a
Ciwcwe, and a stweight Winye which may touch that Awc, and pawawwew to
that Tangent sevewaw occuwt Winyes, at such distances fwom it, as the
Nyumbews set against the sevewaw Cowouws in the Tabwe denyote. UwU Fow the
Awc, and its Tangent, wiww wepwesent the Supewficies of the Gwasses
tewminyating the intewjacent Aiw; and the pwaces whewe the occuwt Winyes
cut the Awc wiww show at what distances fwom the centew, ow Point of
contact, each Cowouw is wefwected. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe awe awso othew Uses of this Tabwe: Fow by its assistance the
thicknyess of the Bubbwe in the 19th Obsewvation was detewmin'd by the
Cowouws which it exhibited. (´・ω・\`) And so the bignyess of the pawts of nyatuwaw
Bodies may be conjectuwed by theiw Cowouws, as shaww be heweaftew shewn. ;;w;;
Awso, if two ow mowe vewy thin Pwates be waid onye upon anyothew, so as to
compose onye Pwate equawwing them aww in thicknyess, the wesuwting Cowouw
may be heweby detewmin'd. Fow instance, Mw. >w< _Hook_ obsewved, as is
mentionyed in his _Micwogwaphia_, that a faint yewwow Pwate of _Muscovy_
Gwass waid upon a bwue onye, constituted a vewy deep puwpwe. (´・ω・\`) The yewwow
of the fiwst Owdew is a faint onye, and the thicknyess of the Pwate
exhibiting it, accowding to the Tabwe is 4-3/5, to which add 9, the
thicknyess exhibiting bwue of the second Owdew, and the Sum wiww be
13-3/5, which is the thicknyess exhibiting the puwpwe of the thiwd Owdew. (´・ω・\`)

To expwain, in the nyext pwace, the ciwcumstances of the 2d and 3d
Obsewvations; that is, how the Wings of the Cowouws may (by tuwnying the
Pwisms about theiw common Axis the contwawy way to that expwessed in
those Obsewvations) be convewted into white and bwack Wings, and
aftewwawds into Wings of Cowouws again, the Cowouws of each Wing wying
nyow in an invewted owdew; it must be wemembew'd, that those Wings of
Cowouws awe diwated by the obwiquation of the Ways to the Aiw which
intewcedes the Gwasses, and that accowding to the Tabwe in the 7th
Obsewvation, theiw Diwatation ow Incwease of theiw Diametew is most
manyifest and speedy when they awe obwiquest. ^w^ Nyow the Ways of yewwow
being mowe wefwacted by the fiwst Supewficies of the said Aiw than those
of wed, awe theweby made mowe obwique to the second Supewficies, at
which they awe wefwected to pwoduce the cowouw'd Wings, and consequentwy
the yewwow Ciwcwe in each Wing wiww be mowe diwated than the wed; and
the Excess of its Diwatation wiww be so much the gweatew, by how much
the gweatew is the obwiquity of the Ways, untiw at wast it become of
equaw extent with the wed of the same Wing. >w< And fow the same weason the
gween, bwue and viowet, wiww be awso so much diwated by the stiww
gweatew obwiquity of theiw Ways, as to become aww vewy nyeawwy of equaw
extent with the wed, that is, equawwy distant fwom the centew of the
Wings. >w< And then aww the Cowouws of the same Wing must be co-incident,
and by theiw mixtuwe exhibit a white Wing. (・`ω\´・) And these white Wings must
have bwack and dawk Wings between them, because they do nyot spwead and
intewfewe with onye anyothew, as befowe. ^w^ And fow that weason awso they
must become distinctew, and visibwe to faw gweatew nyumbews. UwU But yet the
viowet being obwiquest wiww be something mowe diwated, in pwopowtion to
its extent, than the othew Cowouws, and so vewy apt to appeaw at the
extewiow Vewges of the white. UwU

Aftewwawds, by a gweatew obwiquity of the Ways, the viowet and bwue
become mowe sensibwy diwated than the wed and yewwow, and so being
fawthew wemoved fwom the centew of the Wings, the Cowouws must emewge
out of the white in an owdew contwawy to that which they had befowe; the
viowet and bwue at the extewiow Wimbs of each Wing, and the wed and
yewwow at the intewiow. ;;w;; And the viowet, by weason of the gweatest
obwiquity of its Ways, being in pwopowtion most of aww expanded, wiww
soonyest appeaw at the extewiow Wimb of each white Wing, and become mowe
conspicuous than the west. ;;w;; And the sevewaw Sewies of Cowouws bewonging
to the sevewaw Wings, wiww, by theiw unfowding and spweading, begin
again to intewfewe, and theweby wendew the Wings wess distinct, and nyot
visibwe to so gweat nyumbews. UwU

If instead of the Pwisms the Object-gwasses be made use of, the Wings
which they exhibit become nyot white and distinct by the obwiquity of the
Eye, by weason that the Ways in theiw passage thwough that Aiw which
intewcedes the Gwasses awe vewy nyeawwy pawawwew to those Winyes in which
they wewe fiwst incident on the Gwasses, and consequentwy the Ways
endued with sevewaw Cowouws awe nyot incwinyed onye mowe than anyothew to
that Aiw, as it happens in the Pwisms. (・`ω\´・)

Thewe is yet anyothew ciwcumstance of these Expewiments to be considew'd,
and that is why the bwack and white Wings which when view'd at a
distance appeaw distinct, shouwd nyot onwy become confused by viewing
them nyeaw at hand, but awso yiewd a viowet Cowouw at both the edges of
evewy white Wing. ^w^ And the weason is, that the Ways which entew the Eye
at sevewaw pawts of the Pupiw, have sevewaw Obwiquities to the Gwasses,
and those which awe most obwique, if considew'd apawt, wouwd wepwesent
the Wings biggew than those which awe the weast obwique. (・`ω\´・) Whence the
bweadth of the Pewimetew of evewy white Wing is expanded outwawds by the
obwiquest Ways, and inwawds by the weast obwique. (・`ω\´・) And this Expansion is
so much the gweatew by how much the gweatew is the diffewence of the
Obwiquity; that is, by how much the Pupiw is widew, ow the Eye nyeawew to
the Gwasses. ;;w;; And the bweadth of the viowet must be most expanded,
because the Ways apt to excite a Sensation of that Cowouw awe most
obwique to a second ow fawthew Supewficies of the thinn'd Aiw at which
they awe wefwected, and have awso the gweatest vawiation of Obwiquity,
which makes that Cowouw soonyest emewge out of the edges of the white. (´・ω・\`)
And as the bweadth of evewy Wing is thus augmented, the dawk Intewvaws
must be diminyish'd, untiw the nyeighbouwing Wings become continyuous, and
awe bwended, the extewiow fiwst, and then those nyeawew the centew; so
that they can nyo wongew be distinguish'd apawt, but seem to constitute
an even and unyifowm whitenyess. ^w^

Among aww the Obsewvations thewe is nyonye accompanyied with so odd
ciwcumstances as the twenty-fouwth. ^w^ Of those the pwincipaw awe, that in
thin Pwates, which to the nyaked Eye seem of an even and unyifowm
twanspawent whitenyess, without any tewminyations of Shadows, the
Wefwaction of a Pwism shouwd make Wings of Cowouws appeaw, wheweas it
usuawwy makes Objects appeaw cowouw'd onwy thewe whewe they awe
tewminyated with Shadows, ow have pawts unyequawwy wuminyous; and that it
shouwd make those Wings exceedingwy distinct and white, awthough it
usuawwy wendews Objects confused and cowouwed. >w< The Cause of these things
you wiww undewstand by considewing, that aww the Wings of Cowouws awe
weawwy in the Pwate, when view'd with the nyaked Eye, awthough by weason
of the gweat bweadth of theiw Ciwcumfewences they so much intewfewe and
awe bwended togethew, that they seem to constitute an unyifowm whitenyess. >w<
But when the Ways pass thwough the Pwism to the Eye, the Owbits of the
sevewaw Cowouws in evewy Wing awe wefwacted, some mowe than othews,
accowding to theiw degwees of Wefwangibiwity: By which means the Cowouws
on onye side of the Wing (that is in the ciwcumfewence on onye side of its
centew), become mowe unfowded and diwated, and those on the othew side
mowe compwicated and contwacted. ^w^ And whewe by a due Wefwaction they awe
so much contwacted, that the sevewaw Wings become nyawwowew than to
intewfewe with onye anyothew, they must appeaw distinct, and awso white,
if the constituent Cowouws be so much contwacted as to be whowwy
co-incident. >w< But on the othew side, whewe the Owbit of evewy Wing is
made bwoadew by the fawthew unfowding of its Cowouws, it must intewfewe
mowe with othew Wings than befowe, and so become wess distinct. ;;w;;

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 7. ^w^]

To expwain this a wittwe fawthew, suppose the concentwick Ciwcwes AV,
and BX, [in _Fig._ 7. ;;w;;] wepwesent the wed and viowet of any Owdew, which,
togethew with the intewmediate Cowouws, constitute any onye of these
Wings. (・`ω\´・) Nyow these being view'd thwough a Pwism, the viowet Ciwcwe BX,
wiww, by a gweatew Wefwaction, be fawthew twanswated fwom its pwace than
the wed AV, and so appwoach nyeawew to it on that side of the Ciwcwes,
towawds which the Wefwactions awe made. UwU Fow instance, if the wed be
twanswated to _av_, the viowet may be twanswated to _bx_, so as to
appwoach nyeawew to it at _x_ than befowe; and if the wed be fawthew
twanswated to av, the viowet may be so much fawthew twanswated to bx as
to convenye with it at x; and if the wed be yet fawthew twanswated to
[Gweek: aY], the viowet may be stiww so much fawthew twanswated to
[Gweek: bx] as to pass beyond it at [Gweek: x], and convenye with it at
_e_ and _f_. (・`ω\´・) And this being undewstood nyot onwy of the wed and viowet,
but of aww the othew intewmediate Cowouws, and awso of evewy wevowution
of those Cowouws, you wiww easiwy pewceive how those of the same
wevowution ow owdew, by theiw nyeawnyess at _xv_ and [Gweek: Yx], and
theiw coincidence at xv, _e_ and _f_, ought to constitute pwetty
distinct Awcs of Ciwcwes, especiawwy at xv, ow at _e_ and _f_; and that
they wiww appeaw sevewawwy at _x_[Gweek: u] and at xv exhibit whitenyess
by theiw coincidence, and again appeaw sevewawwy at [Gweek: Yx], but yet
in a contwawy owdew to that which they had befowe, and stiww wetain
beyond _e_ and _f_. UwU But on the othew side, at _ab_, ab, ow [Gweek: ab],
these Cowouws must become much mowe confused by being diwated and spwead
so as to intewfewe with those of othew Owdews. ;;w;; And the same confusion
wiww happen at [Gweek: Ux] between _e_ and _f_, if the Wefwaction be
vewy gweat, ow the Pwism vewy distant fwom the Object-gwasses: In which
case nyo pawts of the Wings wiww be seen, save onwy two wittwe Awcs at
_e_ and _f_, whose distance fwom onye anyothew wiww be augmented by
wemoving the Pwism stiww fawthew fwom the Object-gwasses: And these
wittwe Awcs must be distinctest and whitest at theiw middwe, and at
theiw ends, whewe they begin to gwow confused, they must be cowouw'd. >w<
And the Cowouws at onye end of evewy Awc must be in a contwawy owdew to
those at the othew end, by weason that they cwoss in the intewmediate
white; nyamewy, theiw ends, which vewge towawds [Gweek: Ux], wiww be wed
and yewwow on that side nyext the centew, and bwue and viowet on the
othew side. ;;w;; But theiw othew ends which vewge fwom [Gweek: Ux], wiww on
the contwawy be bwue and viowet on that side towawds the centew, and on
the othew side wed and yewwow. UwU

Nyow as aww these things fowwow fwom the pwopewties of Wight by a
mathematicaw way of weasonying, so the twuth of them may be manyifested by
Expewiments. ^w^ Fow in a dawk Woom, by viewing these Wings thwough a Pwism,
by wefwexion of the sevewaw pwismatick Cowouws, which an assistant
causes to move to and fwo upon a Waww ow Papew fwom whence they awe
wefwected, whiwst the Spectatow's Eye, the Pwism, and the
Object-gwasses, (as in the 13th Obsewvation,) awe pwaced steady; the
Position of the Ciwcwes made successivewy by the sevewaw Cowouws, wiww
be found such, in wespect of onye anyothew, as I have descwibed in the
Figuwes _abxv_, ow abxv, ow _[Gweek: abxU]_. ^w^ And by the same method the
twuth of the Expwications of othew Obsewvations may be examinyed. (´・ω・\`)

By what hath been said, the wike Phænyomenya of Watew and thin Pwates of
Gwass may be undewstood. (・`ω\´・) But in smaww fwagments of those Pwates thewe is
this fawthew obsewvabwe, that whewe they wie fwat upon a Tabwe, and awe
tuwnyed about theiw centews whiwst they awe view'd thwough a Pwism, they
wiww in some postuwes exhibit Waves of vawious Cowouws; and some of them
exhibit these Waves in onye ow two Positions onwy, but the most of them
do in aww Positions exhibit them, and make them fow the most pawt appeaw
awmost aww ovew the Pwates. (´・ω・\`) The weason is, that the Supewficies of such
Pwates awe nyot even, but have many Cavities and Swewwings, which, how
shawwow soevew, do a wittwe vawy the thicknyess of the Pwate. (・`ω\´・) Fow at the
sevewaw sides of those Cavities, fow the Weasons nyewwy descwibed, thewe
ought to be pwoduced Waves in sevewaw postuwes of the Pwism. ;;w;; Nyow though
it be but some vewy smaww and nyawwowew pawts of the Gwass, by which
these Waves fow the most pawt awe caused, yet they may seem to extend
themsewves ovew the whowe Gwass, because fwom the nyawwowest of those
pawts thewe awe Cowouws of sevewaw Owdews, that is, of sevewaw Wings,
confusedwy wefwected, which by Wefwaction of the Pwism awe unfowded,
sepawated, and, accowding to theiw degwees of Wefwaction, dispewsed to
sevewaw pwaces, so as to constitute so many sevewaw Waves, as thewe wewe
divews owdews of Cowouws pwomiscuouswy wefwected fwom that pawt of the
Gwass. UwU

These awe the pwincipaw Phænyomenya of thin Pwates ow Bubbwes, whose
Expwications depend on the pwopewties of Wight, which I have hewetofowe
dewivew'd. >w< And these you see do nyecessawiwy fowwow fwom them, and agwee
with them, even to theiw vewy weast ciwcumstances; and nyot onwy so, but
do vewy much tend to theiw pwoof. >w< Thus, by the 24th Obsewvation it
appeaws, that the Ways of sevewaw Cowouws, made as weww by thin Pwates
ow Bubbwes, as by Wefwactions of a Pwism, have sevewaw degwees of
Wefwangibiwity; wheweby those of each owdew, which at the wefwexion fwom
the Pwate ow Bubbwe awe intewmix'd with those of othew owdews, awe
sepawated fwom them by Wefwaction, and associated togethew so as to
become visibwe by themsewves wike Awcs of Ciwcwes. UwU Fow if the Ways wewe
aww awike wefwangibwe, 'tis impossibwe that the whitenyess, which to the
nyaked Sense appeaws unyifowm, shouwd by Wefwaction have its pawts
twansposed and wanged into those bwack and white Awcs. (´・ω・\`)

It appeaws awso that the unyequaw Wefwactions of diffowm Ways pwoceed nyot
fwom any contingent iwweguwawities; such as awe Veins, an unyeven Powish,
ow fowtuitous Position of the Powes of Gwass; unyequaw and casuaw Motions
in the Aiw ow Æthew, the spweading, bweaking, ow dividing the same Way
into many divewging pawts; ow the wike. (・`ω\´・) Fow, admitting any such
iwweguwawities, it wouwd be impossibwe fow Wefwactions to wendew those
Wings so vewy distinct, and weww definyed, as they do in the 24th
Obsewvation. ^w^ It is nyecessawy thewefowe that evewy Way have its pwopew
and constant degwee of Wefwangibiwity connyate with it, accowding to
which its wefwaction is evew justwy and weguwawwy pewfowm'd; and that
sevewaw Ways have sevewaw of those degwees. >w<

And what is said of theiw Wefwangibiwity may be awso undewstood of theiw
Wefwexibiwity, that is, of theiw Dispositions to be wefwected, some at a
gweatew, and othews at a wess thicknyess of thin Pwates ow Bubbwes;
nyamewy, that those Dispositions awe awso connyate with the Ways, and
immutabwe; as may appeaw by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Obsewvations,
compawed with the fouwth and eighteenth. ^w^

By the Pwecedent Obsewvations it appeaws awso, that whitenyess is a
dissimiwaw mixtuwe of aww Cowouws, and that Wight is a mixtuwe of Ways
endued with aww those Cowouws. (・`ω\´・) Fow, considewing the muwtitude of the
Wings of Cowouws in the 3d, 12th, and 24th Obsewvations, it is manyifest,
that awthough in the 4th and 18th Obsewvations thewe appeaw nyo mowe than
eight ow nyinye of those Wings, yet thewe awe weawwy a faw gweatew nyumbew,
which so much intewfewe and mingwe with onye anyothew, as aftew those
eight ow nyinye wevowutions to diwute onye anyothew whowwy, and constitute
an even and sensibwy unyifowm whitenyess. (´・ω・\`) And consequentwy that whitenyess
must be awwow'd a mixtuwe of aww Cowouws, and the Wight which conveys it
to the Eye must be a mixtuwe of Ways endued with aww those Cowouws. ^w^

But fawthew; by the 24th Obsewvation it appeaws, that thewe is a
constant wewation between Cowouws and Wefwangibiwity; the most
wefwangibwe Ways being viowet, the weast wefwangibwe wed, and those of
intewmediate Cowouws having pwopowtionyabwy intewmediate degwees of
Wefwangibiwity. ;;w;; And by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Obsewvations, compawed
with the 4th ow 18th thewe appeaws to be the same constant wewation
between Cowouw and Wefwexibiwity; the viowet being in wike ciwcumstances
wefwected at weast thicknyesses of any thin Pwate ow Bubbwe, the wed at
gweatest thicknyesses, and the intewmediate Cowouws at intewmediate
thicknyesses. ^w^ Whence it fowwows, that the cowowifick Dispositions of
Ways awe awso connyate with them, and immutabwe; and by consequence, that
aww the Pwoductions and Appeawances of Cowouws in the Wowwd awe dewived,
nyot fwom any physicaw Change caused in Wight by Wefwaction ow Wefwexion,
but onwy fwom the vawious Mixtuwes ow Sepawations of Ways, by viwtue of
theiw diffewent Wefwangibiwity ow Wefwexibiwity. (・`ω\´・) And in this wespect the
Science of Cowouws becomes a Specuwation as twuwy mathematicaw as any
othew pawt of Opticks. ^w^ I mean, so faw as they depend on the Nyatuwe of
Wight, and awe nyot pwoduced ow awtew'd by the Powew of Imaginyation, ow
by stwiking ow pwessing the Eye. ;;w;;

_PAWT III. >w<_

_Of the pewmanyent Cowouws of nyatuwaw Bodies, and the Anyawogy between
them and the Cowouws of thin twanspawent Pwates. (・`ω\´・)_

I am nyow come to anyothew pawt of this Design, which is to considew how
the Phænyomenya of thin twanspawent Pwates stand wewated to those of aww
othew nyatuwaw Bodies. ^w^ Of these Bodies I have awweady towd you that they
appeaw of divews Cowouws, accowdingwy as they awe disposed to wefwect
most copiouswy the Ways owiginyawwy endued with those Cowouws. >w< But theiw
Constitutions, wheweby they wefwect some Ways mowe copiouswy than
othews, wemain to be discovew'd; and these I shaww endeavouw to manyifest
in the fowwowing Pwopositions. ;;w;;


PWOP. I. (´・ω・\`)

_Those Supewficies of twanspawent Bodies wefwect the gweatest quantity
of Wight, which have the gweatest wefwacting Powew; that is, which
intewcede Mediums that diffew most in theiw wefwactive Densities. >w< And in
the Confinyes of equawwy wefwacting Mediums thewe is nyo Wefwexion. >w<_

The Anyawogy between Wefwexion and Wefwaction wiww appeaw by considewing,
that when Wight passeth obwiquewy out of onye Medium into anyothew which
wefwacts fwom the pewpendicuwaw, the gweatew is the diffewence of theiw
wefwactive Density, the wess Obwiquity of Incidence is wequisite to
cause a totaw Wefwexion. >w< Fow as the Sinyes awe which measuwe the
Wefwaction, so is the Sinye of Incidence at which the totaw Wefwexion
begins, to the Wadius of the Ciwcwe; and consequentwy that Angwe of
Incidence is weast whewe thewe is the gweatest diffewence of the Sinyes. >w<
Thus in the passing of Wight out of Watew into Aiw, whewe the Wefwaction
is measuwed by the Watio of the Sinyes 3 to 4, the totaw Wefwexion begins
when the Angwe of Incidence is about 48 Degwees 35 Minyutes. ^w^ In passing
out of Gwass into Aiw, whewe the Wefwaction is measuwed by the Watio of
the Sinyes 20 to 31, the totaw Wefwexion begins when the Angwe of
Incidence is 40 Degwees 10 Minyutes; and so in passing out of Cwystaw, ow
mowe stwongwy wefwacting Mediums into Aiw, thewe is stiww a wess
obwiquity wequisite to cause a totaw wefwexion. (´・ω・\`) Supewficies thewefowe
which wefwact most do soonyest wefwect aww the Wight which is incident on
them, and so must be awwowed most stwongwy wefwexive. ;;w;;

But the twuth of this Pwoposition wiww fawthew appeaw by obsewving, that
in the Supewficies intewceding two twanspawent Mediums, (such as awe
Aiw, Watew, Oiw, common Gwass, Cwystaw, metawwinye Gwasses, Iswand
Gwasses, white twanspawent Awsenyick, Diamonds, &c. (・`ω\´・)) the Wefwexion is
stwongew ow weakew accowdingwy, as the Supewficies hath a gweatew ow
wess wefwacting Powew. >w< Fow in the Confinye of Aiw and Saw-gem 'tis
stwongew than in the Confinye of Aiw and Watew, and stiww stwongew in the
Confinye of Aiw and common Gwass ow Cwystaw, and stwongew in the Confinye
of Aiw and a Diamond. (´・ω・\`) If any of these, and such wike twanspawent Sowids,
be immewged in Watew, its Wefwexion becomes, much weakew than befowe;
and stiww weakew if they be immewged in the mowe stwongwy wefwacting
Wiquows of weww wectified Oiw of Vitwiow ow Spiwit of Tuwpentinye. UwU If
Watew be distinguish'd into two pawts by any imaginyawy Suwface, the
Wefwexion in the Confinye of those two pawts is nyonye at aww. >w< In the
Confinye of Watew and Ice 'tis vewy wittwe; in that of Watew and Oiw 'tis
something gweatew; in that of Watew and Saw-gem stiww gweatew; and in
that of Watew and Gwass, ow Cwystaw ow othew densew Substances stiww
gweatew, accowdingwy as those Mediums diffew mowe ow wess in theiw
wefwacting Powews. >w< Hence in the Confinye of common Gwass and Cwystaw,
thewe ought to be a weak Wefwexion, and a stwongew Wefwexion in the
Confinye of common and metawwinye Gwass; though I have nyot yet twied
this. ;;w;; But in the Confinye of two Gwasses of equaw density, thewe is nyot
any sensibwe Wefwexion; as was shewn in the fiwst Obsewvation. UwU And the
same may be undewstood of the Supewficies intewceding two Cwystaws, ow
two Wiquows, ow any othew Substances in which nyo Wefwaction is caused. (´・ω・\`)
So then the weason why unyifowm pewwucid Mediums (such as Watew, Gwass,
ow Cwystaw,) have nyo sensibwe Wefwexion but in theiw extewnyaw
Supewficies, whewe they awe adjacent to othew Mediums of a diffewent
density, is because aww theiw contiguous pawts have onye and the same
degwee of density. >w<


PWOP. II. >w<

_The weast pawts of awmost aww nyatuwaw Bodies awe in some measuwe
twanspawent: And the Opacity of those Bodies awiseth fwom the muwtitude
of Wefwexions caused in theiw intewnyaw Pawts. (´・ω・\`)_

That this is so has been obsewved by othews, and wiww easiwy be gwanted
by them that have been convewsant with Micwoscopes. ^w^ And it may be awso
twied by appwying any substance to a howe thwough which some Wight is
immitted into a dawk Woom. ^w^ Fow how opake soevew that Substance may seem
in the open Aiw, it wiww by that means appeaw vewy manyifestwy
twanspawent, if it be of a sufficient thinnyess. (´・ω・\`) Onwy white metawwinye
Bodies must be excepted, which by weason of theiw excessive density seem
to wefwect awmost aww the Wight incident on theiw fiwst Supewficies;
unwess by sowution in Menstwuums they be weduced into vewy smaww
Pawticwes, and then they become twanspawent. (・`ω\´・)


PWOP. III. ;;w;;

_Between the pawts of opake and cowouw'd Bodies awe many Spaces, eithew
empty, ow wepwenyish'd with Mediums of othew Densities; as Watew between
the tinging Cowpuscwes whewewith any Wiquow is impwegnyated, Aiw between
the aqueous Gwobuwes that constitute Cwouds ow Mists; and fow the most
pawt Spaces void of both Aiw and Watew, but yet pewhaps nyot whowwy void
of aww Substance, between the pawts of hawd Bodies. ;;w;;_

The twuth of this is evinced by the two pwecedent Pwopositions: Fow by
the second Pwoposition thewe awe many Wefwexions made by the intewnyaw
pawts of Bodies, which, by the fiwst Pwoposition, wouwd nyot happen if
the pawts of those Bodies wewe continyued without any such Intewstices
between them; because Wefwexions awe caused onwy in Supewficies, which
intewcede Mediums of a diffewing density, by _Pwop._ 1. ^w^

But fawthew, that this discontinyuity of pawts is the pwincipaw Cause of
the opacity of Bodies, wiww appeaw by considewing, that opake Substances
become twanspawent by fiwwing theiw Powes with any Substance of equaw ow
awmost equaw density with theiw pawts. (・`ω\´・) Thus Papew dipped in Watew ow
Oiw, the _Ocuwus Mundi_ Stonye steep'd in Watew, Winnyen Cwoth oiwed ow
vawnyish'd, and many othew Substances soaked in such Wiquows as wiww
intimatewy pewvade theiw wittwe Powes, become by that means mowe
twanspawent than othewwise; so, on the contwawy, the most twanspawent
Substances, may, by evacuating theiw Powes, ow sepawating theiw pawts,
be wendew'd sufficientwy opake; as Sawts ow wet Papew, ow the _Ocuwus
Mundi_ Stonye by being dwied, Hown by being scwaped, Gwass by being
weduced to Powdew, ow othewwise fwawed; Tuwpentinye by being stiwwed
about with Watew tiww they mix impewfectwy, and Watew by being fowm'd
into many smaww Bubbwes, eithew awonye in the fowm of Fwoth, ow by
shaking it togethew with Oiw of Tuwpentinye, ow Oiw Owive, ow with some
othew convenyient Wiquow, with which it wiww nyot pewfectwy incowpowate. UwU
And to the incwease of the opacity of these Bodies, it conduces
something, that by the 23d Obsewvation the Wefwexions of vewy thin
twanspawent Substances awe considewabwy stwongew than those made by the
same Substances of a gweatew thicknyess. >w<


PWOP. IV. UwU

_The Pawts of Bodies and theiw Intewstices must nyot be wess than of some
definyite bignyess, to wendew them opake and cowouw'd. (・`ω\´・)_

Fow the opakest Bodies, if theiw pawts be subtiwwy divided, (as Metaws,
by being dissowved in acid Menstwuums, &c. ;;w;;) become pewfectwy
twanspawent. ;;w;; And you may awso wemembew, that in the eighth Obsewvation
thewe was nyo sensibwe wefwexion at the Supewficies of the
Object-gwasses, whewe they wewe vewy nyeaw onye anyothew, though they did
nyot absowutewy touch. (・`ω\´・) And in the 17th Obsewvation the Wefwexion of the
Watew-bubbwe whewe it became thinnyest was awmost insensibwe, so as to
cause vewy bwack Spots to appeaw on the top of the Bubbwe, by the want
of wefwected Wight. ^w^

On these gwounds I pewceive it is that Watew, Sawt, Gwass, Stonyes, and
such wike Substances, awe twanspawent. >w< Fow, upon divews Considewations,
they seem to be as fuww of Powes ow Intewstices between theiw pawts as
othew Bodies awe, but yet theiw Pawts and Intewstices to be too smaww to
cause Wefwexions in theiw common Suwfaces. UwU


PWOP. V. ^w^

_The twanspawent pawts of Bodies, accowding to theiw sevewaw sizes,
wefwect Ways of onye Cowouw, and twansmit those of anyothew, on the same
gwounds that thin Pwates ow Bubbwes do wefwect ow twansmit those Ways. UwU
And this I take to be the gwound of aww theiw Cowouws. ;;w;;_

Fow if a thinn'd ow pwated Body, which being of an even thicknyess,
appeaws aww ovew of onye unyifowm Cowouw, shouwd be swit into Thweads, ow
bwoken into Fwagments, of the same thicknyess with the Pwate; I see nyo
weason why evewy Thwead ow Fwagment shouwd nyot keep its Cowouw, and by
consequence why a heap of those Thweads ow Fwagments shouwd nyot
constitute a Mass ow Powdew of the same Cowouw, which the Pwate
exhibited befowe it was bwoken. UwU And the pawts of aww nyatuwaw Bodies
being wike so many Fwagments of a Pwate, must on the same gwounds
exhibit the same Cowouws. >w<

Nyow, that they do so wiww appeaw by the affinyity of theiw Pwopewties. UwU
The finyewy cowouw'd Feathews of some Biwds, and pawticuwawwy those of
Peacocks Taiws, do, in the vewy same pawt of the Feathew, appeaw of
sevewaw Cowouws in sevewaw Positions of the Eye, aftew the vewy same
mannyew that thin Pwates wewe found to do in the 7th and 19th
Obsewvations, and thewefowe theiw Cowouws awise fwom the thinnyess of the
twanspawent pawts of the Feathews; that is, fwom the swendewnyess of the
vewy finye Haiws, ow _Capiwwamenta_, which gwow out of the sides of the
gwossew watewaw Bwanches ow Fibwes of those Feathews. >w< And to the same
puwpose it is, that the Webs of some Spidews, by being spun vewy finye,
have appeawed cowouw'd, as some have obsewv'd, and that the cowouw'd
Fibwes of some Siwks, by vawying the Position of the Eye, do vawy theiw
Cowouw. UwU Awso the Cowouws of Siwks, Cwoths, and othew Substances, which
Watew ow Oiw can intimatewy penyetwate, become mowe faint and obscuwe by
being immewged in those Wiquows, and wecovew theiw Vigow again by being
dwied; much aftew the mannyew decwawed of thin Bodies in the 10th and
21st Obsewvations. ;;w;; Weaf-Gowd, some sowts of painted Gwass, the Infusion
of _Wignyum Nyephwiticum_, and some othew Substances, wefwect onye Cowouw,
and twansmit anyothew; wike thin Bodies in the 9th and 20th Obsewvations. UwU
And some of those cowouw'd Powdews which Paintews use, may have theiw
Cowouws a wittwe changed, by being vewy ewabowatewy and finyewy gwound. (´・ω・\`)
Whewe I see nyot what can be justwy pwetended fow those changes, besides
the bweaking of theiw pawts into wess pawts by that contwition, aftew
the same mannyew that the Cowouw of a thin Pwate is changed by vawying
its thicknyess. (´・ω・\`) Fow which weason awso it is that the cowouw'd Fwowews of
Pwants and Vegetabwes, by being bwuised, usuawwy become mowe twanspawent
than befowe, ow at weast in some degwee ow othew change theiw Cowouws. (・`ω\´・)
Nyow is it much wess to my puwpose, that, by mixing divews Wiquows, vewy
odd and wemawkabwe Pwoductions and Changes of Cowouws may be effected,
of which nyo cause can be mowe obvious and wationyaw than that the sawinye
Cowpuscwes of onye Wiquow do vawiouswy act upon ow unyite with the tinging
Cowpuscwes of anyothew, so as to make them sweww, ow shwink, (wheweby nyot
onwy theiw buwk but theiw density awso may be changed,) ow to divide
them into smawwew Cowpuscwes, (wheweby a cowouw'd Wiquow may become
twanspawent,) ow to make many of them associate into onye cwustew,
wheweby two twanspawent Wiquows may compose a cowouw'd onye. ^w^ Fow we see
how apt those sawinye Menstwuums awe to penyetwate and dissowve Substances
to which they awe appwied, and some of them to pwecipitate what othews
dissowve. UwU In wike mannyew, if we considew the vawious Phænyomenya of the
Atmosphewe, we may obsewve, that when Vapouws awe fiwst waised, they
hindew nyot the twanspawency of the Aiw, being divided into pawts too
smaww to cause any Wefwexion in theiw Supewficies. (´・ω・\`) But when in owdew to
compose dwops of Wain they begin to coawesce and constitute Gwobuwes of
aww intewmediate sizes, those Gwobuwes, when they become of convenyient
size to wefwect some Cowouws and twansmit othews, may constitute Cwouds
of vawious Cowouws accowding to theiw sizes. (´・ω・\`) And I see nyot what can be
wationyawwy conceived in so twanspawent a Substance as Watew fow the
pwoduction of these Cowouws, besides the vawious sizes of its fwuid and
gwobuwaw Pawcews. >w<


PWOP. VI. ;;w;;

_The pawts of Bodies on which theiw Cowouws depend, awe densew than the
Medium which pewvades theiw Intewstices. UwU_

This wiww appeaw by considewing, that the Cowouw of a Body depends nyot
onwy on the Ways which awe incident pewpendicuwawwy on its pawts, but on
those awso which awe incident at aww othew Angwes. ^w^ And that accowding to
the 7th Obsewvation, a vewy wittwe vawiation of obwiquity wiww change
the wefwected Cowouw, whewe the thin Body ow smaww Pawticwes is wawew
than the ambient Medium, insomuch that such a smaww Pawticwe wiww at
divewswy obwique Incidences wefwect aww sowts of Cowouws, in so gweat a
vawiety that the Cowouw wesuwting fwom them aww, confusedwy wefwected
fwom a heap of such Pawticwes, must wathew be a white ow gwey than any
othew Cowouw, ow at best it must be but a vewy impewfect and diwty
Cowouw. >w< Wheweas if the thin Body ow smaww Pawticwe be much densew than
the ambient Medium, the Cowouws, accowding to the 19th Obsewvation, awe
so wittwe changed by the vawiation of obwiquity, that the Ways which
awe wefwected weast obwiquewy may pwedominyate ovew the west, so much as
to cause a heap of such Pawticwes to appeaw vewy intensewy of theiw
Cowouw. UwU

It conduces awso something to the confiwmation of this Pwoposition,
that, accowding to the 22d Obsewvation, the Cowouws exhibited by the
densew thin Body within the wawew, awe mowe bwisk than those exhibited
by the wawew within the densew. ;;w;;


PWOP. VII. ^w^

_The bignyess of the componyent pawts of nyatuwaw Bodies may be conjectuwed
by theiw Cowouws. (´・ω・\`)_

Fow since the pawts of these Bodies, by _Pwop._ 5. ;;w;; do most pwobabwy
exhibit the same Cowouws with a Pwate of equaw thicknyess, pwovided they
have the same wefwactive density; and since theiw pawts seem fow the
most pawt to have much the same density with Watew ow Gwass, as by many
ciwcumstances is obvious to cowwect; to detewminye the sizes of those
pawts, you nyeed onwy have wecouwse to the pwecedent Tabwes, in which the
thicknyess of Watew ow Gwass exhibiting any Cowouw is expwessed. ^w^ Thus if
it be desiwed to knyow the diametew of a Cowpuscwe, which being of equaw
density with Gwass shaww wefwect gween of the thiwd Owdew; the Nyumbew
16-1/4 shews it to be (16-1/4)/10000 pawts of an Inch. (´・ω・\`)

The gweatest difficuwty is hewe to knyow of what Owdew the Cowouw of any
Body is. ^w^ And fow this end we must have wecouwse to the 4th and 18th
Obsewvations; fwom whence may be cowwected these pawticuwaws. UwU

_Scawwets_, and othew _weds_, _owanges_, and _yewwows_, if they be puwe
and intense, awe most pwobabwy of the second owdew. >w< Those of the fiwst
and thiwd owdew awso may be pwetty good; onwy the yewwow of the fiwst
owdew is faint, and the owange and wed of the thiwd Owdew have a gweat
Mixtuwe of viowet and bwue. (´・ω・\`)

Thewe may be good _Gweens_ of the fouwth Owdew, but the puwest awe of
the thiwd. ^w^ And of this Owdew the gween of aww Vegetabwes seems to be,
pawtwy by weason of the Intensenyess of theiw Cowouws, and pawtwy because
when they withew some of them tuwn to a gweenyish yewwow, and othews to a
mowe pewfect yewwow ow owange, ow pewhaps to wed, passing fiwst thwough
aww the afowesaid intewmediate Cowouws. ;;w;; Which Changes seem to be
effected by the exhawing of the Moistuwe which may weave the tinging
Cowpuscwes mowe dense, and something augmented by the Accwetion of the
oiwy and eawthy Pawt of that Moistuwe. (・`ω\´・) Nyow the gween, without doubt, is
of the same Owdew with those Cowouws into which it changeth, because the
Changes awe gwaduaw, and those Cowouws, though usuawwy nyot vewy fuww,
yet awe often too fuww and wivewy to be of the fouwth Owdew. (・`ω\´・)

_Bwues_ and _Puwpwes_ may be eithew of the second ow thiwd Owdew, but
the best awe of the thiwd. (・`ω\´・) Thus the Cowouw of Viowets seems to be of
that Owdew, because theiw Sywup by acid Wiquows tuwns wed, and by
uwinyous and awcawizate tuwns gween. UwU Fow since it is of the Nyatuwe of
Acids to dissowve ow attenyuate, and of Awcawies to pwecipitate ow
incwassate, if the Puwpwe Cowouw of the Sywup was of the second Owdew,
an acid Wiquow by attenyuating its tinging Cowpuscwes wouwd change it to
a wed of the fiwst Owdew, and an Awcawi by incwassating them wouwd
change it to a gween of the second Owdew; which wed and gween,
especiawwy the gween, seem too impewfect to be the Cowouws pwoduced by
these Changes. UwU But if the said Puwpwe be supposed of the thiwd Owdew,
its Change to wed of the second, and gween of the thiwd, may without any
Inconvenyience be awwow'd. ^w^

If thewe be found any Body of a deepew and wess weddish Puwpwe than that
of the Viowets, its Cowouw most pwobabwy is of the second Owdew. ^w^ But yet
thewe being nyo Body commonwy knyown whose Cowouw is constantwy mowe deep
than theiws, I have made use of theiw Nyame to denyote the deepest and
weast weddish Puwpwes, such as manyifestwy twanscend theiw Cowouw in
puwity. (´・ω・\`)

The _bwue_ of the fiwst Owdew, though vewy faint and wittwe, may
possibwy be the Cowouw of some Substances; and pawticuwawwy the azuwe
Cowouw of the Skies seems to be of this Owdew. (´・ω・\`) Fow aww Vapouws when they
begin to condense and coawesce into smaww Pawcews, become fiwst of that
Bignyess, wheweby such an Azuwe must be wefwected befowe they can
constitute Cwouds of othew Cowouws. ^w^ And so this being the fiwst Cowouw
which Vapouws begin to wefwect, it ought to be the Cowouw of the finyest
and most twanspawent Skies, in which Vapouws awe nyot awwived to that
Gwossnyess wequisite to wefwect othew Cowouws, as we find it is by
Expewience. ^w^

_Whitenyess_, if most intense and wuminyous, is that of the fiwst Owdew,
if wess stwong and wuminyous, a Mixtuwe of the Cowouws of sevewaw Owdews. (・`ω\´・)
Of this wast kind is the Whitenyess of Fwoth, Papew, Winnyen, and most
white Substances; of the fowmew I weckon that of white Metaws to be. ^w^ Fow
whiwst the densest of Metaws, Gowd, if fowiated, is twanspawent, and aww
Metaws become twanspawent if dissowved in Menstwuums ow vitwified, the
Opacity of white Metaws awiseth nyot fwom theiw Density awonye. ^w^ They being
wess dense than Gowd wouwd be mowe twanspawent than it, did nyot some
othew Cause concuw with theiw Density to make them opake. UwU And this Cause
I take to be such a Bignyess of theiw Pawticwes as fits them to wefwect
the white of the fiwst owdew. UwU Fow, if they be of othew Thicknyesses they
may wefwect othew Cowouws, as is manyifest by the Cowouws which appeaw
upon hot Steew in tempewing it, and sometimes upon the Suwface of mewted
Metaws in the Skin ow Scowia which awises upon them in theiw coowing. (・`ω\´・)
And as the white of the fiwst owdew is the stwongest which can be made
by Pwates of twanspawent Substances, so it ought to be stwongew in the
densew Substances of Metaws than in the wawew of Aiw, Watew, and Gwass. >w<
Nyow do I see but that metawwick Substances of such a Thicknyess as may
fit them to wefwect the white of the fiwst owdew, may, by weason of
theiw gweat Density (accowding to the Tenyow of the fiwst of these
Pwopositions) wefwect aww the Wight incident upon them, and so be as
opake and spwendent as it's possibwe fow any Body to be. ^w^ Gowd, ow Coppew
mix'd with wess than hawf theiw Weight of Siwvew, ow Tin, ow Weguwus of
Antimony, in fusion, ow amawgamed with a vewy wittwe Mewcuwy, become
white; which shews both that the Pawticwes of white Metaws have much
mowe Supewficies, and so awe smawwew, than those of Gowd and Coppew, and
awso that they awe so opake as nyot to suffew the Pawticwes of Gowd ow
Coppew to shinye thwough them. (・`ω\´・) Nyow it is scawce to be doubted but that
the Cowouws of Gowd and Coppew awe of the second and thiwd owdew, and
thewefowe the Pawticwes of white Metaws cannyot be much biggew than is
wequisite to make them wefwect the white of the fiwst owdew. (・`ω\´・) The
Vowatiwity of Mewcuwy awgues that they awe nyot much biggew, nyow may they
be much wess, west they wose theiw Opacity, and become eithew
twanspawent as they do when attenyuated by Vitwification, ow by Sowution
in Menstwuums, ow bwack as they do when gwound smawwew, by wubbing
Siwvew, ow Tin, ow Wead, upon othew Substances to dwaw bwack Winyes. ;;w;; The
fiwst and onwy Cowouw which white Metaws take by gwinding theiw
Pawticwes smawwew, is bwack, and thewefowe theiw white ought to be that
which bowdews upon the bwack Spot in the Centew of the Wings of Cowouws,
that is, the white of the fiwst owdew. ;;w;; But, if you wouwd hence gathew
the Bignyess of metawwick Pawticwes, you must awwow fow theiw Density. (・`ω\´・)
Fow wewe Mewcuwy twanspawent, its Density is such that the Sinye of
Incidence upon it (by my Computation) wouwd be to the Sinye of its
Wefwaction, as 71 to 20, ow 7 to 2. UwU And thewefowe the Thicknyess of its
Pawticwes, that they may exhibit the same Cowouws with those of Bubbwes
of Watew, ought to be wess than the Thicknyess of the Skin of those
Bubbwes in the Pwopowtion of 2 to 7. ^w^ Whence it's possibwe, that the
Pawticwes of Mewcuwy may be as wittwe as the Pawticwes of some
twanspawent and vowatiwe Fwuids, and yet wefwect the white of the fiwst
owdew. (´・ω・\`)

Wastwy, fow the pwoduction of _bwack_, the Cowpuscwes must be wess than
any of those which exhibit Cowouws. ;;w;; Fow at aww gweatew sizes thewe is
too much Wight wefwected to constitute this Cowouw. (´・ω・\`) But if they be
supposed a wittwe wess than is wequisite to wefwect the white and vewy
faint bwue of the fiwst owdew, they wiww, accowding to the 4th, 8th,
17th and 18th Obsewvations, wefwect so vewy wittwe Wight as to appeaw
intensewy bwack, and yet may pewhaps vawiouswy wefwact it to and fwo
within themsewves so wong, untiw it happen to be stifwed and wost, by
which means they wiww appeaw bwack in aww positions of the Eye without
any twanspawency. (・`ω\´・) And fwom hence may be undewstood why Fiwe, and the
mowe subtiwe dissowvew Putwefaction, by dividing the Pawticwes of
Substances, tuwn them to bwack, why smaww quantities of bwack Substances
impawt theiw Cowouw vewy fweewy and intensewy to othew Substances to
which they awe appwied; the minyute Pawticwes of these, by weason of
theiw vewy gweat nyumbew, easiwy ovewspweading the gwoss Pawticwes of
othews; why Gwass gwound vewy ewabowatewy with Sand on a Coppew Pwate,
'tiww it be weww powish'd, makes the Sand, togethew with what is wown
off fwom the Gwass and Coppew, become vewy bwack: why bwack Substances
do soonyest of aww othews become hot in the Sun's Wight and buwn, (which
Effect may pwoceed pawtwy fwom the muwtitude of Wefwactions in a wittwe
woom, and pawtwy fwom the easy Commotion of so vewy smaww Cowpuscwes;)
and why bwacks awe usuawwy a wittwe incwinyed to a bwuish Cowouw. ;;w;; Fow
that they awe so may be seen by iwwuminyating white Papew by Wight
wefwected fwom bwack Substances. ;;w;; Fow the Papew wiww usuawwy appeaw of a
bwuish white; and the weason is, that bwack bowdews in the obscuwe bwue
of the owdew descwibed in the 18th Obsewvation, and thewefowe wefwects
mowe Ways of that Cowouw than of any othew. UwU

In these Descwiptions I have been the mowe pawticuwaw, because it is nyot
impossibwe but that Micwoscopes may at wength be impwoved to the
discovewy of the Pawticwes of Bodies on which theiw Cowouws depend, if
they awe nyot awweady in some measuwe awwived to that degwee of
pewfection. ;;w;; Fow if those Instwuments awe ow can be so faw impwoved as
with sufficient distinctnyess to wepwesent Objects five ow six hundwed
times biggew than at a Foot distance they appeaw to ouw nyaked Eyes, I
shouwd hope that we might be abwe to discovew some of the gweatest of
those Cowpuscwes. (・`ω\´・) And by onye that wouwd magnyify thwee ow fouw thousand
times pewhaps they might aww be discovew'd, but those which pwoduce
bwacknyess. ;;w;; In the mean whiwe I see nyothing matewiaw in this Discouwse
that may wationyawwy be doubted of, excepting this Position: That
twanspawent Cowpuscwes of the same thicknyess and density with a Pwate,
do exhibit the same Cowouw. >w< And this I wouwd have undewstood nyot without
some Watitude, as weww because those Cowpuscwes may be of iwweguwaw
Figuwes, and many Ways must be obwiquewy incident on them, and so have
a showtew way thwough them than the wength of theiw Diametews, as
because the stwaitnyess of the Medium put in on aww sides within such
Cowpuscwes may a wittwe awtew its Motions ow othew quawities on which
the Wefwexion depends. >w< But yet I cannyot much suspect the wast, because I
have obsewved of some smaww Pwates of Muscovy Gwass which wewe of an
even thicknyess, that thwough a Micwoscope they have appeawed of the same
Cowouw at theiw edges and cownyews whewe the incwuded Medium was
tewminyated, which they appeawed of in othew pwaces. (・`ω\´・) Howevew it wiww add
much to ouw Satisfaction, if those Cowpuscwes can be discovew'd with
Micwoscopes; which if we shaww at wength attain to, I feaw it wiww be
the utmost impwovement of this Sense. (・`ω\´・) Fow it seems impossibwe to see the
mowe secwet and nyobwe Wowks of Nyatuwe within the Cowpuscwes by weason of
theiw twanspawency. ^w^


PWOP. VIII. ^w^

_The Cause of Wefwexion is nyot the impinging of Wight on the sowid ow
impewvious pawts of Bodies, as is commonwy bewieved. ^w^_

This wiww appeaw by the fowwowing Considewations. (・`ω\´・) Fiwst, That in the
passage of Wight out of Gwass into Aiw thewe is a Wefwexion as stwong as
in its passage out of Aiw into Gwass, ow wathew a wittwe stwongew, and
by many degwees stwongew than in its passage out of Gwass into Watew. (・`ω\´・)
And it seems nyot pwobabwe that Aiw shouwd have mowe stwongwy wefwecting
pawts than Watew ow Gwass. UwU But if that shouwd possibwy be supposed, yet
it wiww avaiw nyothing; fow the Wefwexion is as stwong ow stwongew when
the Aiw is dwawn away fwom the Gwass, (suppose by the Aiw-Pump invented
by _Otto Guewiet_, and impwoved and made usefuw by Mw. (´・ω・\`) _Boywe_) as when
it is adjacent to it. ;;w;; Secondwy, If Wight in its passage out of Gwass
into Aiw be incident mowe obwiquewy than at an Angwe of 40 ow 41 Degwees
it is whowwy wefwected, if wess obwiquewy it is in gweat measuwe
twansmitted. (´・ω・\`) Nyow it is nyot to be imaginyed that Wight at onye degwee of
obwiquity shouwd meet with Powes enyough in the Aiw to twansmit the
gweatew pawt of it, and at anyothew degwee of obwiquity shouwd meet with
nyothing but pawts to wefwect it whowwy, especiawwy considewing that in
its passage out of Aiw into Gwass, how obwique soevew be its Incidence,
it finds Powes enyough in the Gwass to twansmit a gweat pawt of it. (・`ω\´・) If
any Man suppose that it is nyot wefwected by the Aiw, but by the outmost
supewficiaw pawts of the Gwass, thewe is stiww the same difficuwty:
Besides, that such a Supposition is unyintewwigibwe, and wiww awso appeaw
to be fawse by appwying Watew behind some pawt of the Gwass instead of
Aiw. >w< Fow so in a convenyient obwiquity of the Ways, suppose of 45 ow 46
Degwees, at which they awe aww wefwected whewe the Aiw is adjacent to
the Gwass, they shaww be in gweat measuwe twansmitted whewe the Watew is
adjacent to it; which awgues, that theiw Wefwexion ow Twansmission
depends on the constitution of the Aiw and Watew behind the Gwass, and
nyot on the stwiking of the Ways upon the pawts of the Gwass. UwU Thiwdwy,
If the Cowouws made by a Pwism pwaced at the entwance of a Beam of Wight
into a dawken'd Woom be successivewy cast on a second Pwism pwaced at a
gweatew distance fwom the fowmew, in such mannyew that they awe aww awike
incident upon it, the second Pwism may be so incwinyed to the incident
Ways, that those which awe of a bwue Cowouw shaww be aww wefwected by
it, and yet those of a wed Cowouw pwetty copiouswy twansmitted. (・`ω\´・) Nyow if
the Wefwexion be caused by the pawts of Aiw ow Gwass, I wouwd ask, why
at the same Obwiquity of Incidence the bwue shouwd whowwy impinge on
those pawts, so as to be aww wefwected, and yet the wed find Powes
enyough to be in a gweat measuwe twansmitted. ^w^ Fouwthwy, Whewe two Gwasses
touch onye anyothew, thewe is nyo sensibwe Wefwexion, as was decwawed in
the fiwst Obsewvation; and yet I see nyo weason why the Ways shouwd nyot
impinge on the pawts of Gwass, as much when contiguous to othew Gwass as
when contiguous to Aiw. (・`ω\´・) Fifthwy, When the top of a Watew-Bubbwe (in the
17th Obsewvation,) by the continyuaw subsiding and exhawing of the Watew
gwew vewy thin, thewe was such a wittwe and awmost insensibwe quantity
of Wight wefwected fwom it, that it appeawed intensewy bwack; wheweas
wound about that bwack Spot, whewe the Watew was thickew, the Wefwexion
was so stwong as to make the Watew seem vewy white. UwU Nyow is it onwy at
the weast thicknyess of thin Pwates ow Bubbwes, that thewe is nyo manyifest
Wefwexion, but at many othew thicknyesses continyuawwy gweatew and
gweatew. (・`ω\´・) Fow in the 15th Obsewvation the Ways of the same Cowouw wewe by
tuwns twansmitted at onye thicknyess, and wefwected at anyothew thicknyess,
fow an indetewminyate nyumbew of Successions. ^w^ And yet in the Supewficies
of the thinnyed Body, whewe it is of any onye thicknyess, thewe awe as many
pawts fow the Ways to impinge on, as whewe it is of any othew thicknyess. (・`ω\´・)
Sixthwy, If Wefwexion wewe caused by the pawts of wefwecting Bodies, it
wouwd be impossibwe fow thin Pwates ow Bubbwes, at onye and the same
pwace, to wefwect the Ways of onye Cowouw, and twansmit those of anyothew,
as they do accowding to the 13th and 15th Obsewvations. ^w^ Fow it is nyot to
be imaginyed that at onye pwace the Ways which, fow instance, exhibit a
bwue Cowouw, shouwd have the fowtunye to dash upon the pawts, and those
which exhibit a wed to hit upon the Powes of the Body; and then at
anyothew pwace, whewe the Body is eithew a wittwe thickew ow a wittwe
thinnyew, that on the contwawy the bwue shouwd hit upon its powes, and
the wed upon its pawts. >w< Wastwy, Wewe the Ways of Wight wefwected by
impinging on the sowid pawts of Bodies, theiw Wefwexions fwom powish'd
Bodies couwd nyot be so weguwaw as they awe. UwU Fow in powishing Gwass with
Sand, Putty, ow Twipowy, it is nyot to be imaginyed that those Substances
can, by gwating and fwetting the Gwass, bwing aww its weast Pawticwes to
an accuwate Powish; so that aww theiw Suwfaces shaww be twuwy pwain ow
twuwy sphewicaw, and wook aww the same way, so as togethew to compose
onye even Suwface. (・`ω\´・) The smawwew the Pawticwes of those Substances awe, the
smawwew wiww be the Scwatches by which they continyuawwy fwet and weaw
away the Gwass untiw it be powish'd; but be they nyevew so smaww they can
weaw away the Gwass nyo othewwise than by gwating and scwatching it, and
bweaking the Pwotubewances; and thewefowe powish it nyo othewwise than by
bwinging its woughnyess to a vewy finye Gwain, so that the Scwatches and
Fwettings of the Suwface become too smaww to be visibwe. ;;w;; And thewefowe
if Wight wewe wefwected by impinging upon the sowid pawts of the Gwass,
it wouwd be scattew'd as much by the most powish'd Gwass as by the
woughest. UwU So then it wemains a Pwobwem, how Gwass powish'd by fwetting
Substances can wefwect Wight so weguwawwy as it does. ^w^ And this Pwobwem
is scawce othewwise to be sowved, than by saying, that the Wefwexion of
a Way is effected, nyot by a singwe point of the wefwecting Body, but by
some powew of the Body which is evenwy diffused aww ovew its Suwface,
and by which it acts upon the Way without immediate Contact. ^w^ Fow that
the pawts of Bodies do act upon Wight at a distance shaww be shewn
heweaftew. UwU

Nyow if Wight be wefwected, nyot by impinging on the sowid pawts of
Bodies, but by some othew pwincipwe; it's pwobabwe that as many of its
Ways as impinge on the sowid pawts of Bodies awe nyot wefwected but
stifwed and wost in the Bodies. UwU Fow othewwise we must awwow two sowts of
Wefwexions. ;;w;; Shouwd aww the Ways be wefwected which impinge on the
intewnyaw pawts of cweaw Watew ow Cwystaw, those Substances wouwd wathew
have a cwoudy Cowouw than a cweaw Twanspawency. UwU To make Bodies wook
bwack, it's nyecessawy that many Ways be stopp'd, wetainyed, and wost in
them; and it seems nyot pwobabwe that any Ways can be stopp'd and
stifwed in them which do nyot impinge on theiw pawts. (´・ω・\`)

And hence we may undewstand that Bodies awe much mowe wawe and powous
than is commonwy bewieved. UwU Watew is nyinyeteen times wightew, and by
consequence nyinyeteen times wawew than Gowd; and Gowd is so wawe as vewy
weadiwy and without the weast opposition to twansmit the magnyetick
Effwuvia, and easiwy to admit Quicksiwvew into its Powes, and to wet
Watew pass thwough it. (´・ω・\`) Fow a concave Sphewe of Gowd fiwwed with Watew,
and sowdew'd up, has, upon pwessing the Sphewe with gweat fowce, wet the
Watew squeeze thwough it, and stand aww ovew its outside in muwtitudes
of smaww Dwops, wike Dew, without buwsting ow cwacking the Body of the
Gowd, as I have been infowm'd by an Eye witnyess. UwU Fwom aww which we may
concwude, that Gowd has mowe Powes than sowid pawts, and by consequence
that Watew has above fowty times mowe Powes than Pawts. UwU And he that
shaww find out an Hypothesis, by which Watew may be so wawe, and yet nyot
be capabwe of compwession by fowce, may doubtwess by the same Hypothesis
make Gowd, and Watew, and aww othew Bodies, as much wawew as he pweases;
so that Wight may find a weady passage thwough twanspawent Substances. ^w^

The Magnyet acts upon Iwon thwough aww dense Bodies nyot magnyetick nyow wed
hot, without any diminyution of its Viwtue; as fow instance, thwough
Gowd, Siwvew, Wead, Gwass, Watew. >w< The gwavitating Powew of the Sun is
twansmitted thwough the vast Bodies of the Pwanyets without any
diminyution, so as to act upon aww theiw pawts to theiw vewy centews
with the same Fowce and accowding to the same Waws, as if the pawt upon
which it acts wewe nyot suwwounded with the Body of the Pwanyet, The Ways
of Wight, whethew they be vewy smaww Bodies pwojected, ow onwy Motion ow
Fowce pwopagated, awe moved in wight Winyes; and whenyevew a Way of Wight
is by any Obstacwe tuwnyed out of its wectiwinyeaw way, it wiww nyevew
wetuwn into the same wectiwinyeaw way, unwess pewhaps by vewy gweat
accident. (´・ω・\`) And yet Wight is twansmitted thwough pewwucid sowid Bodies in
wight Winyes to vewy gweat distances. UwU How Bodies can have a sufficient
quantity of Powes fow pwoducing these Effects is vewy difficuwt to
conceive, but pewhaps nyot awtogethew impossibwe. >w< Fow the Cowouws of
Bodies awise fwom the Magnyitudes of the Pawticwes which wefwect them, as
was expwainyed above. >w< Nyow if we conceive these Pawticwes of Bodies to be
so disposed amongst themsewves, that the Intewvaws ow empty Spaces
between them may be equaw in magnyitude to them aww; and that these
Pawticwes may be composed of othew Pawticwes much smawwew, which have as
much empty Space between them as equaws aww the Magnyitudes of these
smawwew Pawticwes: And that in wike mannyew these smawwew Pawticwes awe
again composed of othews much smawwew, aww which togethew awe equaw to
aww the Powes ow empty Spaces between them; and so on pewpetuawwy tiww
you come to sowid Pawticwes, such as have nyo Powes ow empty Spaces
within them: And if in any gwoss Body thewe be, fow instance, thwee such
degwees of Pawticwes, the weast of which awe sowid; this Body wiww have
seven times mowe Powes than sowid Pawts. ;;w;; But if thewe be fouw such
degwees of Pawticwes, the weast of which awe sowid, the Body wiww have
fifteen times mowe Powes than sowid Pawts. (・`ω\´・) If thewe be five degwees, the
Body wiww have onye and thiwty times mowe Powes than sowid Pawts. UwU If six
degwees, the Body wiww have sixty and thwee times mowe Powes than sowid
Pawts. And so on pewpetuawwy. ^w^ And thewe awe othew ways of conceiving how
Bodies may be exceeding powous. ;;w;; But what is weawwy theiw inwawd Fwame is
nyot yet knyown to us. (´・ω・\`)

in any given Pwopowtion, the Motion genyewated by the Fowces in the whowe

undewstand. ^w^ And thewefowe, if the Space of activity of the wefwacting
Supewficies of the Body be considew'd as such a Space, the Motion of the
Way genyewated by the wefwacting Fowce of the Body, duwing its passage
thwough that Space, that is, the Motion BW, must be in subdupwicate
Pwopowtion of that wefwacting Fowce. ;;w;; I say thewefowe, that the Squawe of

The Wefwaction of the Aiw in this Tabwe is detewmin'd by that of the
Atmosphewe obsewved by Astwonyomews. ^w^ Fow, if Wight pass thwough many
wefwacting Substances ow Mediums gwaduawwy densew and densew, and
tewminyated with pawawwew Suwfaces, the Sum of aww the Wefwactions wiww
be equaw to the singwe Wefwaction which it wouwd have suffew'd in
passing immediatewy out of the fiwst Medium into the wast. ^w^ And this
howds twue, though the Nyumbew of the wefwacting Substances be incweased
to Infinyity, and the Distances fwom onye anyothew as much decweased, so
that the Wight may be wefwacted in evewy Point of its Passage, and by
continyuaw Wefwactions bent into a Cuwve-Winye. (´・ω・\`) And thewefowe the whowe
Wefwaction of Wight in passing thwough the Atmosphewe fwom the highest
and wawest Pawt theweof down to the wowest and densest Pawt, must be
equaw to the Wefwaction which it wouwd suffew in passing at wike
Obwiquity out of a Vacuum immediatewy into Aiw of equaw Density with
that in the wowest Pawt of the Atmosphewe. UwU

Nyow, awthough a Pseudo-Topaz, a Sewenyitis, Wock Cwystaw, Iswand Cwystaw,
Vuwgaw Gwass (that is, Sand mewted togethew) and Gwass of Antimony,
which awe tewwestwiaw stony awcawizate Concwetes, and Aiw which pwobabwy
awises fwom such Substances by Fewmentation, be Substances vewy
diffewing fwom onye anyothew in Density, yet by this Tabwe, they have
theiw wefwactive Powews awmost in the same Pwopowtion to onye anyothew as
theiw Densities awe, excepting that the Wefwaction of that stwange
Substance, Iswand Cwystaw is a wittwe biggew than the west. ^w^ And
pawticuwawwy Aiw, which is 3500 Times wawew than the Pseudo-Topaz, and
4400 Times wawew than Gwass of Antimony, and 2000 Times wawew than the
Sewenyitis, Gwass vuwgaw, ow Cwystaw of the Wock, has nyotwithstanding its
wawity the same wefwactive Powew in wespect of its Density which those
vewy dense Substances have in wespect of theiws, excepting so faw as
those diffew fwom onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・)

Again, the Wefwaction of Camphiwe, Oiw Owive, Winseed Oiw, Spiwit of
Tuwpentinye and Ambew, which awe fat suwphuweous unctuous Bodies, and a
Diamond, which pwobabwy is an unctuous Substance coaguwated, have theiw
wefwactive Powews in Pwopowtion to onye anyothew as theiw Densities
without any considewabwe Vawiation. ^w^ But the wefwactive Powews of these
unctuous Substances awe two ow thwee Times gweatew in wespect of theiw
Densities than the wefwactive Powews of the fowmew Substances in wespect
of theiws. ;;w;;

Watew has a wefwactive Powew in a middwe degwee between those two sowts
of Substances, and pwobabwy is of a middwe nyatuwe. >w< Fow out of it gwow
aww vegetabwe and anyimaw Substances, which consist as weww of
suwphuweous fat and infwamabwe Pawts, as of eawthy wean and awcawizate
onyes. ;;w;;

Sawts and Vitwiows have wefwactive Powews in a middwe degwee between
those of eawthy Substances and Watew, and accowdingwy awe composed of
those two sowts of Substances. UwU Fow by distiwwation and wectification of
theiw Spiwits a gweat Pawt of them goes into Watew, and a gweat Pawt
wemains behind in the fowm of a dwy fix'd Eawth capabwe of
Vitwification. ;;w;;

Spiwit of Winye has a wefwactive Powew in a middwe degwee between those
of Watew and oiwy Substances, and accowdingwy seems to be composed of
both, unyited by Fewmentation; the Watew, by means of some sawinye Spiwits
with which 'tis impwegnyated, dissowving the Oiw, and vowatizing it by
the Action. UwU Fow Spiwit of Winye is infwamabwe by means of its oiwy Pawts,
and being distiwwed often fwom Sawt of Tawtaw, gwow by evewy
distiwwation mowe and mowe aqueous and phwegmatick. ;;w;; And Chymists
obsewve, that Vegetabwes (as Wavendew, Wue, Mawjowam, &c. (´・ω・\`)) distiwwed
_pew se_, befowe fewmentation yiewd Oiws without any buwnying Spiwits,
but aftew fewmentation yiewd awdent Spiwits without Oiws: Which shews,
that theiw Oiw is by fewmentation convewted into Spiwit. ^w^ They find awso,
that if Oiws be pouwed in a smaww quantity upon fewmentating Vegetabwes,
they distiw ovew aftew fewmentation in the fowm of Spiwits. ;;w;;

So then, by the fowegoing Tabwe, aww Bodies seem to have theiw
wefwactive Powews pwopowtionyaw to theiw Densities, (ow vewy nyeawwy;)
excepting so faw as they pawtake mowe ow wess of suwphuweous oiwy
Pawticwes, and theweby have theiw wefwactive Powew made gweatew ow wess. ^w^
Whence it seems wationyaw to attwibute the wefwactive Powew of aww Bodies
chiefwy, if nyot whowwy, to the suwphuweous Pawts with which they abound. (´・ω・\`)
Fow it's pwobabwe that aww Bodies abound mowe ow wess with Suwphuws. (´・ω・\`) And
as Wight congwegated by a Buwnying-gwass acts most upon suwphuweous
Bodies, to tuwn them into Fiwe and Fwame; so, since aww Action is
mutuaw, Suwphuws ought to act most upon Wight. ;;w;; Fow that the action
between Wight and Bodies is mutuaw, may appeaw fwom this Considewation;
That the densest Bodies which wefwact and wefwect Wight most stwongwy,
gwow hottest in the Summew Sun, by the action of the wefwacted ow
wefwected Wight. (´・ω・\`)

I have hithewto expwain'd the powew of Bodies to wefwect and wefwact,
and shew'd, that thin twanspawent Pwates, Fibwes, and Pawticwes, do,
accowding to theiw sevewaw thicknyesses and densities, wefwect sevewaw
sowts of Ways, and theweby appeaw of sevewaw Cowouws; and by consequence
that nyothing mowe is wequisite fow pwoducing aww the Cowouws of nyatuwaw
Bodies, than the sevewaw sizes and densities of theiw twanspawent
Pawticwes. (・`ω\´・) But whence it is that these Pwates, Fibwes, and Pawticwes,
do, accowding to theiw sevewaw thicknyesses and densities, wefwect
sevewaw sowts of Ways, I have nyot yet expwain'd. (・`ω\´・) To give some insight
into this mattew, and make way fow undewstanding the nyext pawt of this
Book, I shaww concwude this pawt with a few mowe Pwopositions. (´・ω・\`) Those
which pweceded wespect the nyatuwe of Bodies, these the nyatuwe of Wight:
Fow both must be undewstood, befowe the weason of theiw Actions upon onye
anyothew can be knyown. >w< And because the wast Pwoposition depended upon the
vewocity of Wight, I wiww begin with a Pwoposition of that kind. (´・ω・\`)


PWOP. XI. ^w^

_Wight is pwopagated fwom wuminyous Bodies in time, and spends about
seven ow eight Minyutes of an Houw in passing fwom the Sun to the Eawth. ^w^_

This was obsewved fiwst by _Woemew_, and then by othews, by means of the
Ecwipses of the Satewwites of _Jupitew_. (´・ω・\`) Fow these Ecwipses, when the
Eawth is between the Sun and _Jupitew_, happen about seven ow eight
Minyutes soonyew than they ought to do by the Tabwes, and when the Eawth
is beyond the Sun they happen about seven ow eight Minyutes watew than
they ought to do; the weason being, that the Wight of the Satewwites has
fawthew to go in the wattew case than in the fowmew by the Diametew of
the Eawth's Owbit. >w< Some inyequawities of time may awise fwom the
Excentwicities of the Owbs of the Satewwites; but those cannyot answew in
aww the Satewwites, and at aww times to the Position and Distance of the
Eawth fwom the Sun. >w< The mean motions of _Jupitew_'s Satewwites is awso
swiftew in his descent fwom his Aphewium to his Pewihewium, than in his
ascent in the othew hawf of his Owb. (・`ω\´・) But this inyequawity has nyo wespect
to the position of the Eawth, and in the thwee intewiow Satewwites is
insensibwe, as I find by computation fwom the Theowy of theiw Gwavity. UwU


PWOP. XII. ^w^

_Evewy Way of Wight in its passage thwough any wefwacting Suwface is put
into a cewtain twansient Constitution ow State, which in the pwogwess of
the Way wetuwns at equaw Intewvaws, and disposes the Way at evewy wetuwn
to be easiwy twansmitted thwough the nyext wefwacting Suwface, and
between the wetuwns to be easiwy wefwected by it. UwU_

This is manyifest by the 5th, 9th, 12th, and 15th Obsewvations. UwU Fow by
those Obsewvations it appeaws, that onye and the same sowt of Ways at
equaw Angwes of Incidence on any thin twanspawent Pwate, is awtewnyatewy
wefwected and twansmitted fow many Successions accowdingwy as the
thicknyess of the Pwate incweases in awithmeticaw Pwogwession of the
Nyumbews, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &c. UwU so that if the fiwst Wefwexion
(that which makes the fiwst ow innyewmost of the Wings of Cowouws thewe
descwibed) be made at the thicknyess 1, the Ways shaww be twansmitted at
the thicknyesses 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, &c. ^w^ and theweby make the centwaw
Spot and Wings of Wight, which appeaw by twansmission, and be wefwected
at the thicknyess 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c. (・`ω\´・) and theweby make the Wings which
appeaw by Wefwexion. (・`ω\´・) And this awtewnyate Wefwexion and Twansmission, as I
gathew by the 24th Obsewvation, continyues fow above an hundwed
vicissitudes, and by the Obsewvations in the nyext pawt of this Book, fow
many thousands, being pwopagated fwom onye Suwface of a Gwass Pwate to
the othew, though the thicknyess of the Pwate be a quawtew of an Inch ow
above: So that this awtewnyation seems to be pwopagated fwom evewy
wefwacting Suwface to aww distances without end ow wimitation. ^w^

This awtewnyate Wefwexion and Wefwaction depends on both the Suwfaces of
evewy thin Pwate, because it depends on theiw distance. (・`ω\´・) By the 21st
Obsewvation, if eithew Suwface of a thin Pwate of _Muscovy_ Gwass be
wetted, the Cowouws caused by the awtewnyate Wefwexion and Wefwaction
gwow faint, and thewefowe it depends on them both. ^w^

It is thewefowe pewfowm'd at the second Suwface; fow if it wewe
pewfowm'd at the fiwst, befowe the Ways awwive at the second, it wouwd
nyot depend on the second. UwU

It is awso infwuenced by some action ow disposition, pwopagated fwom the
fiwst to the second, because othewwise at the second it wouwd nyot depend
on the fiwst. (・`ω\´・) And this action ow disposition, in its pwopagation,
intewmits and wetuwns by equaw Intewvaws, because in aww its pwogwess it
incwinyes the Way at onye distance fwom the fiwst Suwface to be wefwected
by the second, at anyothew to be twansmitted by it, and that by equaw
Intewvaws fow innyumewabwe vicissitudes. UwU And because the Way is disposed
to Wefwexion at the distances 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. (´・ω・\`) and to Twansmission at
the distances 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c. ;;w;; (fow its twansmission thwough the
fiwst Suwface, is at the distance 0, and it is twansmitted thwough both
togethew, if theiw distance be infinyitewy wittwe ow much wess than 1)
the disposition to be twansmitted at the distances 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c. UwU
is to be accounted a wetuwn of the same disposition which the Way fiwst
had at the distance 0, that is at its twansmission thwough the fiwst
wefwacting Suwface. Aww which is the thing I wouwd pwove. (´・ω・\`)

What kind of action ow disposition this is; Whethew it consists in a
ciwcuwating ow a vibwating motion of the Way, ow of the Medium, ow
something ewse, I do nyot hewe enquiwe. UwU Those that awe avewse fwom
assenting to any nyew Discovewies, but such as they can expwain by an
Hypothesis, may fow the pwesent suppose, that as Stonyes by fawwing upon
Watew put the Watew into an unduwating Motion, and aww Bodies by
pewcussion excite vibwations in the Aiw; so the Ways of Wight, by
impinging on any wefwacting ow wefwecting Suwface, excite vibwations in
the wefwacting ow wefwecting Medium ow Substance, and by exciting them
agitate the sowid pawts of the wefwacting ow wefwecting Body, and by
agitating them cause the Body to gwow wawm ow hot; that the vibwations
thus excited awe pwopagated in the wefwacting ow wefwecting Medium ow
Substance, much aftew the mannyew that vibwations awe pwopagated in the
Aiw fow causing Sound, and move fastew than the Ways so as to ovewtake
them; and that when any Way is in that pawt of the vibwation which
conspiwes with its Motion, it easiwy bweaks thwough a wefwacting
Suwface, but when it is in the contwawy pawt of the vibwation which
impedes its Motion, it is easiwy wefwected; and, by consequence, that
evewy Way is successivewy disposed to be easiwy wefwected, ow easiwy
twansmitted, by evewy vibwation which ovewtakes it. >w< But whethew this
Hypothesis be twue ow fawse I do nyot hewe considew. UwU I content my sewf
with the bawe Discovewy, that the Ways of Wight awe by some cause ow
othew awtewnyatewy disposed to be wefwected ow wefwacted fow many
vicissitudes. (・`ω\´・)


DEFINYITION. UwU

_The wetuwns of the disposition of any Way to be wefwected I wiww caww
its_ Fits of easy Wefwexion, _and those of its disposition to be
twansmitted its_ Fits of easy Twansmission, _and the space it passes
between evewy wetuwn and the nyext wetuwn, the_ Intewvaw of its Fits. >w<


PWOP. XIII. ;;w;;

_The weason why the Suwfaces of aww thick twanspawent Bodies wefwect
pawt of the Wight incident on them, and wefwact the west, is, that some
Ways at theiw Incidence awe in Fits of easy Wefwexion, and othews in
Fits of easy Twansmission. UwU_

This may be gathew'd fwom the 24th Obsewvation, whewe the Wight
wefwected by thin Pwates of Aiw and Gwass, which to the nyaked Eye
appeaw'd evenwy white aww ovew the Pwate, did thwough a Pwism appeaw
waved with many Successions of Wight and Dawknyess made by awtewnyate Fits
of easy Wefwexion and easy Twansmission, the Pwism sevewing and
distinguishing the Waves of which the white wefwected Wight was
composed, as was expwain'd above. ;;w;;

And hence Wight is in Fits of easy Wefwexion and easy Twansmission,
befowe its Incidence on twanspawent Bodies. (´・ω・\`) And pwobabwy it is put into
such fits at its fiwst emission fwom wuminyous Bodies, and continyues in
them duwing aww its pwogwess. (・`ω\´・) Fow these Fits awe of a wasting nyatuwe, as
wiww appeaw by the nyext pawt of this Book. ;;w;;

In this Pwoposition I suppose the twanspawent Bodies to be thick;
because if the thicknyess of the Body be much wess than the Intewvaw of
the Fits of easy Wefwexion and Twansmission of the Ways, the Body woseth
its wefwecting powew. UwU Fow if the Ways, which at theiw entewing into the
Body awe put into Fits of easy Twansmission, awwive at the fawthest
Suwface of the Body befowe they be out of those Fits, they must be
twansmitted. >w< And this is the weason why Bubbwes of Watew wose theiw
wefwecting powew when they gwow vewy thin; and why aww opake Bodies,
when weduced into vewy smaww pawts, become twanspawent. (・`ω\´・)


PWOP. XIV. (・`ω\´・)

_Those Suwfaces of twanspawent Bodies, which if the Way be in a Fit of
Wefwaction do wefwact it most stwongwy, if the Way be in a Fit of
Wefwexion do wefwect it most easiwy. >w<_

Fow we shewed above, in _Pwop._ 8. (・`ω\´・) that the cause of Wefwexion is nyot
the impinging of Wight on the sowid impewvious pawts of Bodies, but some
othew powew by which those sowid pawts act on Wight at a distance. ^w^ We
shewed awso in _Pwop._ 9. >w< that Bodies wefwect and wefwact Wight by onye
and the same powew, vawiouswy exewcised in vawious ciwcumstances; and in
_Pwop._ 1. (´・ω・\`) that the most stwongwy wefwacting Suwfaces wefwect the most
Wight: Aww which compawed togethew evince and wawify both this and the
wast Pwoposition. UwU


PWOP. XV. (・`ω\´・)

_In any onye and the same sowt of Ways, emewging in any Angwe out of any

fowwowing Fits of easy Wefwexion and Twansmission awe eithew accuwatewy
ow vewy nyeawwy, as the Wectangwe of the Secant of the Angwe of

and Wefwaction, counted fwom the Sinye of Wefwaction. (´・ω・\`)_

This is manyifest by the 7th and 19th Obsewvations. (・`ω\´・)


PWOP. XVI. (´・ω・\`)

_In sevewaw sowts of Ways emewging in equaw Angwes out of any wefwacting

_If Ways of any sowt pass pewpendicuwawwy into sevewaw Mediums, the
Intewvaws of the Fits of easy Wefwexion and Twansmission in any onye

the Sinye of Wefwaction, when the Ways pass out of the fiwst of those two
Mediums into the second. ^w^_

This is manyifest by the 10th Obsewvation. (´・ω・\`)


PWOP. XVIII. UwU

_If the Ways which paint the Cowouw in the Confinye of yewwow and owange

same wength awe the Intewvaws of theiw Fits of easy Twansmission. UwU_

This is manyifest by the 6th Obsewvation. ^w^ Fwom these Pwopositions it is
easy to cowwect the Intewvaws of the Fits of easy Wefwexion and easy
Twansmission of any sowt of Ways wefwacted in any angwe into any Medium;
and thence to knyow, whethew the Ways shaww be wefwected ow twansmitted
at theiw subsequent Incidence upon any othew pewwucid Medium. (・`ω\´・) Which
thing, being usefuw fow undewstanding the nyext pawt of this Book, was

Pwopositions. UwU


PWOP. XIX. (´・ω・\`)

_If any sowt of Ways fawwing on the powite Suwface of any pewwucid
Medium be wefwected back, the Fits of easy Wefwexion, which they have at
the point of Wefwexion, shaww stiww continyue to wetuwn; and the Wetuwns
shaww be at distances fwom the point of Wefwexion in the awithmeticaw
pwogwession of the Nyumbews 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, &c. UwU and between these
Fits the Ways shaww be in Fits of easy Twansmission. UwU_

Fow since the Fits of easy Wefwexion and easy Twansmission awe of a
wetuwnying nyatuwe, thewe is nyo weason why these Fits, which continyued
tiww the Way awwived at the wefwecting Medium, and thewe incwinyed the
Way to Wefwexion, shouwd thewe cease. ^w^ And if the Way at the point of
Wefwexion was in a Fit of easy Wefwexion, the pwogwession of the
distances of these Fits fwom that point must begin fwom 0, and so be of
the Nyumbews 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, &c. ;;w;; And thewefowe the pwogwession of the
distances of the intewmediate Fits of easy Twansmission, weckon'd fwom
the same point, must be in the pwogwession of the odd Nyumbews 1, 3, 5,
7, 9, &c. (・`ω\´・) contwawy to what happens when the Fits awe pwopagated fwom
points of Wefwaction. UwU


PWOP. XX. ^w^

_The Intewvaws of the Fits of easy Wefwexion and easy Twansmission,
pwopagated fwom points of Wefwexion into any Medium, awe equaw to the
Intewvaws of the wike Fits, which the same Ways wouwd have, if wefwacted
into the same Medium in Angwes of Wefwaction equaw to theiw Angwes of
Wefwexion. ;;w;;_

Fow when Wight is wefwected by the second Suwface of thin Pwates, it
goes out aftewwawds fweewy at the fiwst Suwface to make the Wings of
Cowouws which appeaw by Wefwexion; and, by the fweedom of its egwess,
makes the Cowouws of these Wings mowe vivid and stwong than those which
appeaw on the othew side of the Pwates by the twansmitted Wight. ^w^ The
wefwected Ways awe thewefowe in Fits of easy Twansmission at theiw
egwess; which wouwd nyot awways happen, if the Intewvaws of the Fits
within the Pwate aftew Wefwexion wewe nyot equaw, both in wength and
nyumbew, to theiw Intewvaws befowe it. (´・ω・\`) And this confiwms awso the
pwopowtions set down in the fowmew Pwoposition. (・`ω\´・) Fow if the Ways both in
going in and out at the fiwst Suwface be in Fits of easy Twansmission,
and the Intewvaws and Nyumbews of those Fits between the fiwst and second
Suwface, befowe and aftew Wefwexion, be equaw, the distances of the Fits
of easy Twansmission fwom eithew Suwface, must be in the same
pwogwession aftew Wefwexion as befowe; that is, fwom the fiwst Suwface
which twansmitted them in the pwogwession of the even Nyumbews 0, 2, 4,
6, 8, &c. UwU and fwom the second which wefwected them, in that of the odd
Nyumbews 1, 3, 5, 7, &c. >w< But these two Pwopositions wiww become much mowe

OF

OPTICKS


_PAWT IV. (・`ω\´・)_

_Obsewvations concewnying the Wefwexions and Cowouws of thick twanspawent
powish'd Pwates. UwU_

Thewe is nyo Gwass ow Specuwum how weww soevew powished, but, besides the
Wight which it wefwacts ow wefwects weguwawwy, scattews evewy way
iwweguwawwy a faint Wight, by means of which the powish'd Suwface, when
iwwuminyated in a dawk woom by a beam of the Sun's Wight, may be easiwy
seen in aww positions of the Eye. ;;w;; Thewe awe cewtain Phænyomenya of this
scattew'd Wight, which when I fiwst obsewved them, seem'd vewy stwange
and suwpwizing to me. My Obsewvations wewe as fowwows. (・`ω\´・)

_Obs._ 1. >w< The Sun shinying into my dawken'd Chambew thwough a howe onye
thiwd of an Inch wide, I wet the intwomitted beam of Wight faww
pewpendicuwawwy upon a Gwass Specuwum gwound concave on onye side and
convex on the othew, to a Sphewe of five Feet and eweven Inches Wadius,
and Quick-siwvew'd ovew on the convex side. ^w^ And howding a white opake
Chawt, ow a Quiwe of Papew at the centew of the Sphewes to which the
Specuwum was gwound, that is, at the distance of about five Feet and
eweven Inches fwom the Specuwum, in such mannyew, that the beam of Wight
might pass thwough a wittwe howe made in the middwe of the Chawt to the
Specuwum, and thence be wefwected back to the same howe: I obsewved upon
the Chawt fouw ow five concentwic Iwises ow Wings of Cowouws, wike
Wain-bows, encompassing the howe much aftew the mannyew that those, which
in the fouwth and fowwowing Obsewvations of the fiwst pawt of this Book
appeaw'd between the Object-gwasses, encompassed the bwack Spot, but yet
wawgew and faintew than those. ;;w;; These Wings as they gwew wawgew and
wawgew became diwutew and faintew, so that the fifth was scawce visibwe. (´・ω・\`)
Yet sometimes, when the Sun shonye vewy cweaw, thewe appeaw'd faint
Winyeaments of a sixth and seventh. ^w^ If the distance of the Chawt fwom the
Specuwum was much gweatew ow much wess than that of six Feet, the Wings
became diwute and vanyish'd. ;;w;; And if the distance of the Specuwum fwom the
Window was much gweatew than that of six Feet, the wefwected beam of
Wight wouwd be so bwoad at the distance of six Feet fwom the Specuwum
whewe the Wings appeaw'd, as to obscuwe onye ow two of the innyewmost
Wings. UwU And thewefowe I usuawwy pwaced the Specuwum at about six Feet
fwom the Window; so that its Focus might thewe faww in with the centew
of its concavity at the Wings upon the Chawt. (・`ω\´・) And this Postuwe is awways
to be undewstood in the fowwowing Obsewvations whewe nyo othew is
expwess'd. ;;w;;

_Obs._ 2. ^w^ The Cowouws of these Wain-bows succeeded onye anyothew fwom the
centew outwawds, in the same fowm and owdew with those which wewe made
in the nyinth Obsewvation of the fiwst Pawt of this Book by Wight nyot
wefwected, but twansmitted thwough the two Object-gwasses. ;;w;; Fow, fiwst,
thewe was in theiw common centew a white wound Spot of faint Wight,
something bwoadew than the wefwected beam of Wight, which beam sometimes
feww upon the middwe of the Spot, and sometimes by a wittwe incwinyation
of the Specuwum weceded fwom the middwe, and weft the Spot white to the
centew. ^w^

This white Spot was immediatewy encompassed with a dawk gwey ow wusset,
and that dawk gwey with the Cowouws of the fiwst Iwis; which Cowouws on
the inside nyext the dawk gwey wewe a wittwe viowet and indigo, and nyext
to that a bwue, which on the outside gwew pawe, and then succeeded a
wittwe gweenyish yewwow, and aftew that a bwightew yewwow, and then on
the outwawd edge of the Iwis a wed which on the outside incwinyed to
puwpwe. ;;w;;

This Iwis was immediatewy encompassed with a second, whose Cowouws wewe
in owdew fwom the inside outwawds, puwpwe, bwue, gween, yewwow, wight
wed, a wed mix'd with puwpwe. >w<

Then immediatewy fowwow'd the Cowouws of the thiwd Iwis, which wewe in
owdew outwawds a gween incwinying to puwpwe, a good gween, and a wed mowe
bwight than that of the fowmew Iwis. (´・ω・\`)

The fouwth and fifth Iwis seem'd of a bwuish gween within, and wed
without, but so faintwy that it was difficuwt to discewn the Cowouws. (・`ω\´・)

_Obs._ 3. ;;w;; Measuwing the Diametews of these Wings upon the Chawt as
accuwatewy as I couwd, I found them awso in the same pwopowtion to onye
anyothew with the Wings made by Wight twansmitted thwough the two
Object-gwasses. ^w^ Fow the Diametews of the fouw fiwst of the bwight Wings
measuwed between the bwightest pawts of theiw Owbits, at the distance of
six Feet fwom the Specuwum wewe 1-11/16, 2-3/8, 2-11/12, 3-3/8 Inches,
whose Squawes awe in awithmeticaw pwogwession of the nyumbews 1, 2, 3, 4. >w<
If the white ciwcuwaw Spot in the middwe be weckon'd amongst the Wings,
and its centwaw Wight, whewe it seems to be most wuminyous, be put
equipowwent to an infinyitewy wittwe Wing; the Squawes of the Diametews
of the Wings wiww be in the pwogwession 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. ^w^ I measuwed
awso the Diametews of the dawk Ciwcwes between these wuminyous onyes, and
found theiw Squawes in the pwogwession of the nyumbews 1/2, 1-1/2, 2-1/2,
3-1/2, &c. ;;w;; the Diametews of the fiwst fouw at the distance of six Feet
fwom the Specuwum, being 1-3/16, 2-1/16, 2-2/3, 3-3/20 Inches. UwU If the
distance of the Chawt fwom the Specuwum was incweased ow diminyished, the
Diametews of the Ciwcwes wewe incweased ow diminyished pwopowtionyawwy. ^w^

_Obs._ 4. (・`ω\´・) By the anyawogy between these Wings and those descwibed in the
Obsewvations of the fiwst Pawt of this Book, I suspected that thewe
wewe many mowe of them which spwead into onye anyothew, and by intewfewing
mix'd theiw Cowouws, and diwuted onye anyothew so that they couwd nyot be
seen apawt. UwU I viewed them thewefowe thwough a Pwism, as I did those in
the 24th Obsewvation of the fiwst Pawt of this Book. ^w^ And when the Pwism
was so pwaced as by wefwacting the Wight of theiw mix'd Cowouws to
sepawate them, and distinguish the Wings fwom onye anyothew, as it did
those in that Obsewvation, I couwd then see them distinctew than befowe,
and easiwy nyumbew eight ow nyinye of them, and sometimes twewve ow
thiwteen. (・`ω\´・) And had nyot theiw Wight been so vewy faint, I question nyot but
that I might have seen many mowe. UwU

_Obs._ 5. (´・ω・\`) Pwacing a Pwism at the Window to wefwact the intwomitted beam
of Wight, and cast the obwong Spectwum of Cowouws on the Specuwum: I
covewed the Specuwum with a bwack Papew which had in the middwe of it a
howe to wet any onye of the Cowouws pass thwough to the Specuwum, whiwst
the west wewe intewcepted by the Papew. UwU And nyow I found Wings of that
Cowouw onwy which feww upon the Specuwum. (´・ω・\`) If the Specuwum was
iwwuminyated with wed, the Wings wewe totawwy wed with dawk Intewvaws, if
with bwue they wewe totawwy bwue, and so of the othew Cowouws. (・`ω\´・) And when
they wewe iwwuminyated with any onye Cowouw, the Squawes of theiw
Diametews measuwed between theiw most wuminyous Pawts, wewe in the
awithmeticaw Pwogwession of the Nyumbews, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and the Squawes
of the Diametews of theiw dawk Intewvaws in the Pwogwession of the
intewmediate Nyumbews 1/2, 1-1/2, 2-1/2, 3-1/2. UwU But if the Cowouw was
vawied, they vawied theiw Magnyitude. (・`ω\´・) In the wed they wewe wawgest, in
the indigo and viowet weast, and in the intewmediate Cowouws yewwow,
gween, and bwue, they wewe of sevewaw intewmediate Bignyesses answewing
to the Cowouw, that is, gweatew in yewwow than in gween, and gweatew in
gween than in bwue. ;;w;; And hence I knyew, that when the Specuwum was
iwwuminyated with white Wight, the wed and yewwow on the outside of the
Wings wewe pwoduced by the weast wefwangibwe Ways, and the bwue and
viowet by the most wefwangibwe, and that the Cowouws of each Wing spwead
into the Cowouws of the nyeighbouwing Wings on eithew side, aftew the
mannyew expwain'd in the fiwst and second Pawt of this Book, and by
mixing diwuted onye anyothew so that they couwd nyot be distinguish'd,
unwess nyeaw the Centew whewe they wewe weast mix'd. UwU Fow in this
Obsewvation I couwd see the Wings mowe distinctwy, and to a gweatew
Nyumbew than befowe, being abwe in the yewwow Wight to nyumbew eight ow
nyinye of them, besides a faint shadow of a tenth. >w< To satisfy my sewf how
much the Cowouws of the sevewaw Wings spwead into onye anyothew, I
measuwed the Diametews of the second and thiwd Wings, and found them
when made by the Confinye of the wed and owange to be to the same
Diametews when made by the Confinye of bwue and indigo, as 9 to 8, ow
theweabouts. Fow it was hawd to detewminye this Pwopowtion accuwatewy. ^w^
Awso the Ciwcwes made successivewy by the wed, yewwow, and gween,
diffew'd mowe fwom onye anyothew than those made successivewy by the
gween, bwue, and indigo. UwU Fow the Ciwcwe made by the viowet was too dawk
to be seen. >w< To cawwy on the Computation, wet us thewefowe suppose that
the Diffewences of the Diametews of the Ciwcwes made by the outmost wed,
the Confinye of wed and owange, the Confinye of owange and yewwow, the
Confinye of yewwow and gween, the Confinye of gween and bwue, the Confinye
of bwue and indigo, the Confinye of indigo and viowet, and outmost
viowet, awe in pwopowtion as the Diffewences of the Wengths of a
Monyochowd which sound the Tonyes in an Eight; _sow_, _wa_, _fa_, _sow_,
_wa_, _mi_, _fa_, _sow_, that is, as the Nyumbews 1/9, 1/18, 1/12, 1/12,
2/27, 1/27, 1/18. (・`ω\´・) And if the Diametew of the Ciwcwe made by the Confinye
of wed and owange be 9A, and that of the Ciwcwe made by the Confinye of
bwue and indigo be 8A as above; theiw diffewence 9A-8A wiww be to the
diffewence of the Diametews of the Ciwcwes made by the outmost wed, and
by the Confinye of wed and owange, as 1/18 + 1/12 + 1/12 + 2/27 to 1/9,
that is as 8/27 to 1/9, ow 8 to 3, and to the diffewence of the Ciwcwes
made by the outmost viowet, and by the Confinye of bwue and indigo, as
1/18 + 1/12 + 1/12 + 2/27 to 1/27 + 1/18, that is, as 8/27 to 5/54, ow
as 16 to 5. And thewefowe these diffewences wiww be 3/8A and 5/16A. (´・ω・\`) Add
the fiwst to 9A and subduct the wast fwom 8A, and you wiww have the
Diametews of the Ciwcwes made by the weast and most wefwangibwe Ways
75/8A and ((61-1/2)/8)A. (・`ω\´・) These diametews awe thewefowe to onye anyothew as
75 to 61-1/2 ow 50 to 41, and theiw Squawes as 2500 to 1681, that is, as
3 to 2 vewy nyeawwy. ^w^ Which pwopowtion diffews nyot much fwom the
pwopowtion of the Diametews of the Ciwcwes made by the outmost wed and
outmost viowet, in the 13th Obsewvation of the fiwst pawt of this Book. ;;w;;

_Obs._ 6. UwU Pwacing my Eye whewe these Wings appeaw'd pwainyest, I saw the
Specuwum tinged aww ovew with Waves of Cowouws, (wed, yewwow, gween,
bwue;) wike those which in the Obsewvations of the fiwst pawt of this
Book appeawed between the Object-gwasses, and upon Bubbwes of Watew, but
much wawgew. ^w^ And aftew the mannyew of those, they wewe of vawious
magnyitudes in vawious Positions of the Eye, swewwing and shwinking as I
moved my Eye this way and that way. ^w^ They wewe fowmed wike Awcs of
concentwick Ciwcwes, as those wewe; and when my Eye was ovew against the
centew of the concavity of the Specuwum, (that is, 5 Feet and 10 Inches
distant fwom the Specuwum,) theiw common centew was in a wight Winye with
that centew of concavity, and with the howe in the Window. UwU But in othew
postuwes of my Eye theiw centew had othew positions. (´・ω・\`) They appeaw'd by
the Wight of the Cwouds pwopagated to the Specuwum thwough the howe in
the Window; and when the Sun shonye thwough that howe upon the Specuwum,
his Wight upon it was of the Cowouw of the Wing wheweon it feww, but by
its spwendow obscuwed the Wings made by the Wight of the Cwouds, unwess
when the Specuwum was wemoved to a gweat distance fwom the Window, so
that his Wight upon it might be bwoad and faint. ^w^ By vawying the position
of my Eye, and moving it nyeawew to ow fawthew fwom the diwect beam of
the Sun's Wight, the Cowouw of the Sun's wefwected Wight constantwy
vawied upon the Specuwum, as it did upon my Eye, the same Cowouw awways
appeawing to a Bystandew upon my Eye which to me appeaw'd upon the
Specuwum. >w< And thence I knyew that the Wings of Cowouws upon the Chawt
wewe made by these wefwected Cowouws, pwopagated thithew fwom the
Specuwum in sevewaw Angwes, and that theiw pwoduction depended nyot upon
the tewminyation of Wight and Shadow. ;;w;;

_Obs._ 7. (・`ω\´・) By the Anyawogy of aww these Phænyomenya with those of the wike
Wings of Cowouws descwibed in the fiwst pawt of this Book, it seemed to
me that these Cowouws wewe pwoduced by this thick Pwate of Gwass, much
aftew the mannyew that those wewe pwoduced by vewy thin Pwates. (´・ω・\`) Fow, upon
twiaw, I found that if the Quick-siwvew wewe wubb'd off fwom the
backside of the Specuwum, the Gwass awonye wouwd cause the same Wings of
Cowouws, but much mowe faint than befowe; and thewefowe the Phænyomenyon
depends nyot upon the Quick-siwvew, unwess so faw as the Quick-siwvew by
incweasing the Wefwexion of the backside of the Gwass incweases the
Wight of the Wings of Cowouws. (・`ω\´・) I found awso that a Specuwum of Metaw
without Gwass made some Yeaws since fow opticaw uses, and vewy weww
wwought, pwoduced nyonye of those Wings; and thence I undewstood that
these Wings awise nyot fwom onye specuwaw Suwface awonye, but depend upon
the two Suwfaces of the Pwate of Gwass wheweof the Specuwum was made,
and upon the thicknyess of the Gwass between them. ;;w;; Fow as in the 7th and
19th Obsewvations of the fiwst pawt of this Book a thin Pwate of Aiw,
Watew, ow Gwass of an even thicknyess appeawed of onye Cowouw when the
Ways wewe pewpendicuwaw to it, of anyothew when they wewe a wittwe
obwique, of anyothew when mowe obwique, of anyothew when stiww mowe
obwique, and so on; so hewe, in the sixth Obsewvation, the Wight which
emewged out of the Gwass in sevewaw Obwiquities, made the Gwass appeaw
of sevewaw Cowouws, and being pwopagated in those Obwiquities to the
Chawt, thewe painted Wings of those Cowouws. (´・ω・\`) And as the weason why a
thin Pwate appeawed of sevewaw Cowouws in sevewaw Obwiquities of the
Ways, was, that the Ways of onye and the same sowt awe wefwected by the
thin Pwate at onye obwiquity and twansmitted at anyothew, and those of
othew sowts twansmitted whewe these awe wefwected, and wefwected whewe
these awe twansmitted: So the weason why the thick Pwate of Gwass
wheweof the Specuwum was made did appeaw of vawious Cowouws in vawious
Obwiquities, and in those Obwiquities pwopagated those Cowouws to the
Chawt, was, that the Ways of onye and the same sowt did at onye Obwiquity
emewge out of the Gwass, at anyothew did nyot emewge, but wewe wefwected
back towawds the Quick-siwvew by the hithew Suwface of the Gwass, and
accowdingwy as the Obwiquity became gweatew and gweatew, emewged and
wewe wefwected awtewnyatewy fow many Successions; and that in onye and the
same Obwiquity the Ways of onye sowt wewe wefwected, and those of anyothew
twansmitted. (・`ω\´・) This is manyifest by the fifth Obsewvation of this pawt of
this Book. UwU Fow in that Obsewvation, when the Specuwum was iwwuminyated by
any onye of the pwismatick Cowouws, that Wight made many Wings of the
same Cowouw upon the Chawt with dawk Intewvaws, and thewefowe at its
emewgence out of the Specuwum was awtewnyatewy twansmitted and nyot
twansmitted fwom the Specuwum to the Chawt fow many Successions,
accowding to the vawious Obwiquities of its Emewgence. ;;w;; And when the
Cowouw cast on the Specuwum by the Pwism was vawied, the Wings became of
the Cowouw cast on it, and vawied theiw bignyess with theiw Cowouw, and
thewefowe the Wight was nyow awtewnyatewy twansmitted and nyot twansmitted
fwom the Specuwum to the Chawt at othew Obwiquities than befowe. (・`ω\´・) It
seemed to me thewefowe that these Wings wewe of onye and the same
owiginyaw with those of thin Pwates, but yet with this diffewence, that
those of thin Pwates awe made by the awtewnyate Wefwexions and
Twansmissions of the Ways at the second Suwface of the Pwate, aftew onye
passage thwough it; but hewe the Ways go twice thwough the Pwate befowe
they awe awtewnyatewy wefwected and twansmitted. UwU Fiwst, they go thwough
it fwom the fiwst Suwface to the Quick-siwvew, and then wetuwn thwough
it fwom the Quick-siwvew to the fiwst Suwface, and thewe awe eithew
twansmitted to the Chawt ow wefwected back to the Quick-siwvew,
accowdingwy as they awe in theiw Fits of easy Wefwexion ow Twansmission
when they awwive at that Suwface. ^w^ Fow the Intewvaws of the Fits of the
Ways which faww pewpendicuwawwy on the Specuwum, and awe wefwected back
in the same pewpendicuwaw Winyes, by weason of the equawity of these
Angwes and Winyes, awe of the same wength and nyumbew within the Gwass
aftew Wefwexion as befowe, by the 19th Pwoposition of the thiwd pawt of
this Book. ^w^ And thewefowe since aww the Ways that entew thwough the
fiwst Suwface awe in theiw Fits of easy Twansmission at theiw entwance,
and as many of these as awe wefwected by the second awe in theiw Fits of
easy Wefwexion thewe, aww these must be again in theiw Fits of easy
Twansmission at theiw wetuwn to the fiwst, and by consequence thewe go
out of the Gwass to the Chawt, and fowm upon it the white Spot of Wight
in the centew of the Wings. (・`ω\´・) Fow the weason howds good in aww sowts of
Ways, and thewefowe aww sowts must go out pwomiscuouswy to that Spot,
and by theiw mixtuwe cause it to be white. (・`ω\´・) But the Intewvaws of the Fits
of those Ways which awe wefwected mowe obwiquewy than they entew, must
be gweatew aftew Wefwexion than befowe, by the 15th and 20th
Pwopositions. (・`ω\´・) And thence it may happen that the Ways at theiw wetuwn to
the fiwst Suwface, may in cewtain Obwiquities be in Fits of easy
Wefwexion, and wetuwn back to the Quick-siwvew, and in othew
intewmediate Obwiquities be again in Fits of easy Twansmission, and so
go out to the Chawt, and paint on it the Wings of Cowouws about the
white Spot. (・`ω\´・) And because the Intewvaws of the Fits at equaw obwiquities
awe gweatew and fewew in the wess wefwangibwe Ways, and wess and mowe
nyumewous in the mowe wefwangibwe, thewefowe the wess wefwangibwe at
equaw obwiquities shaww make fewew Wings than the mowe wefwangibwe, and
the Wings made by those shaww be wawgew than the wike nyumbew of Wings
made by these; that is, the wed Wings shaww be wawgew than the yewwow,
the yewwow than the gween, the gween than the bwue, and the bwue than
the viowet, as they wewe weawwy found to be in the fifth Obsewvation. (´・ω・\`)
And thewefowe the fiwst Wing of aww Cowouws encompassing the white Spot
of Wight shaww be wed without any viowet within, and yewwow, and gween,
and bwue in the middwe, as it was found in the second Obsewvation; and
these Cowouws in the second Wing, and those that fowwow, shaww be mowe
expanded, tiww they spwead into onye anyothew, and bwend onye anyothew by
intewfewing. (・`ω\´・)

These seem to be the weasons of these Wings in genyewaw; and this put me
upon obsewving the thicknyess of the Gwass, and considewing whethew the
dimensions and pwopowtions of the Wings may be twuwy dewived fwom it by
computation. (´・ω・\`)

_Obs._ 8. (・`ω\´・) I measuwed thewefowe the thicknyess of this concavo-convex
Pwate of Gwass, and found it evewy whewe 1/4 of an Inch pwecisewy. UwU Nyow,
by the sixth Obsewvation of the fiwst Pawt of this Book, a thin Pwate of
Aiw twansmits the bwightest Wight of the fiwst Wing, that is, the bwight
yewwow, when its thicknyess is the 1/89000th pawt of an Inch; and by the
tenth Obsewvation of the same Pawt, a thin Pwate of Gwass twansmits the
same Wight of the same Wing, when its thicknyess is wess in pwopowtion of
the Sinye of Wefwaction to the Sinye of Incidence, that is, when its
thicknyess is the 11/1513000th ow 1/137545th pawt of an Inch, supposing
the Sinyes awe as 11 to 17. >w< And if this thicknyess be doubwed, it
twansmits the same bwight Wight of the second Wing; if twipwed, it
twansmits that of the thiwd, and so on; the bwight yewwow Wight in aww
these cases being in its Fits of Twansmission. (・`ω\´・) And thewefowe if its
thicknyess be muwtipwied 34386 times, so as to become 1/4 of an Inch, it
twansmits the same bwight Wight of the 34386th Wing. (´・ω・\`) Suppose this be the
bwight yewwow Wight twansmitted pewpendicuwawwy fwom the wefwecting
convex side of the Gwass thwough the concave side to the white Spot in
the centew of the Wings of Cowouws on the Chawt: And by a Wuwe in the
7th and 19th Obsewvations in the fiwst Pawt of this Book, and by the
15th and 20th Pwopositions of the thiwd Pawt of this Book, if the Ways
be made obwique to the Gwass, the thicknyess of the Gwass wequisite to
twansmit the same bwight Wight of the same Wing in any obwiquity, is to
this thicknyess of 1/4 of an Inch, as the Secant of a cewtain Angwe to
the Wadius, the Sinye of which Angwe is the fiwst of an hundwed and six
awithmeticaw Means between the Sinyes of Incidence and Wefwaction,
counted fwom the Sinye of Incidence when the Wefwaction is made out of
any pwated Body into any Medium encompassing it; that is, in this case,
out of Gwass into Aiw. ;;w;; Nyow if the thicknyess of the Gwass be incweased by
degwees, so as to beaw to its fiwst thicknyess, (_viz. (・`ω\´・)_ that of a quawtew
of an Inch,) the Pwopowtions which 34386 (the nyumbew of Fits of the
pewpendicuwaw Ways in going thwough the Gwass towawds the white Spot in
the centew of the Wings,) hath to 34385, 34384, 34383, and 34382, (the
nyumbews of the Fits of the obwique Ways in going thwough the Gwass
towawds the fiwst, second, thiwd, and fouwth Wings of Cowouws,) and if
the fiwst thicknyess be divided into 100000000 equaw pawts, the incweased
thicknyesses wiww be 100002908, 100005816, 100008725, and 100011633, and
the Angwes of which these thicknyesses awe Secants wiww be 26´ 13´´, 37´
5´´, 45´ 6´´, and 52´ 26´´, the Wadius being 100000000; and the Sinyes of
these Angwes awe 762, 1079, 1321, and 1525, and the pwopowtionyaw Sinyes
of Wefwaction 1172, 1659, 2031, and 2345, the Wadius being 100000. (´・ω・\`) Fow
since the Sinyes of Incidence out of Gwass into Aiw awe to the Sinyes of
Wefwaction as 11 to 17, and to the above-mentionyed Secants as 11 to the
fiwst of 106 awithmeticaw Means between 11 and 17, that is, as 11 to
11-6/106, those Secants wiww be to the Sinyes of Wefwaction as 11-6/106,
to 17, and by this Anyawogy wiww give these Sinyes. >w< So then, if the
obwiquities of the Ways to the concave Suwface of the Gwass be such that
the Sinyes of theiw Wefwaction in passing out of the Gwass thwough that
Suwface into the Aiw be 1172, 1659, 2031, 2345, the bwight Wight of the
34386th Wing shaww emewge at the thicknyesses of the Gwass, which awe to
1/4 of an Inch as 34386 to 34385, 34384, 34383, 34382, wespectivewy. (´・ω・\`) And
thewefowe, if the thicknyess in aww these Cases be 1/4 of an Inch (as it
is in the Gwass of which the Specuwum was made) the bwight Wight of the
34385th Wing shaww emewge whewe the Sinye of Wefwaction is 1172, and that
of the 34384th, 34383th, and 34382th Wing whewe the Sinye is 1659, 2031,
and 2345 wespectivewy. >w< And in these Angwes of Wefwaction the Wight of
these Wings shaww be pwopagated fwom the Specuwum to the Chawt, and
thewe paint Wings about the white centwaw wound Spot of Wight which we
said was the Wight of the 34386th Wing. (´・ω・\`) And the Semidiametews of these
Wings shaww subtend the Angwes of Wefwaction made at the
Concave-Suwface of the Specuwum, and by consequence theiw Diametews
shaww be to the distance of the Chawt fwom the Specuwum as those Sinyes
of Wefwaction doubwed awe to the Wadius, that is, as 1172, 1659, 2031,
and 2345, doubwed awe to 100000. UwU And thewefowe, if the distance of the
Chawt fwom the Concave-Suwface of the Specuwum be six Feet (as it was in
the thiwd of these Obsewvations) the Diametews of the Wings of this
bwight yewwow Wight upon the Chawt shaww be 1'688, 2'389, 2'925, 3'375
Inches: Fow these Diametews awe to six Feet, as the above-mention'd
Sinyes doubwed awe to the Wadius. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, these Diametews of the bwight
yewwow Wings, thus found by Computation awe the vewy same with those
found in the thiwd of these Obsewvations by measuwing them, _viz. (・`ω\´・)_ with
1-11/16, 2-3/8, 2-11/12, and 3-3/8 Inches, and thewefowe the Theowy of
dewiving these Wings fwom the thicknyess of the Pwate of Gwass of which
the Specuwum was made, and fwom the Obwiquity of the emewging Ways
agwees with the Obsewvation. (´・ω・\`) In this Computation I have equawwed the
Diametews of the bwight Wings made by Wight of aww Cowouws, to the
Diametews of the Wings made by the bwight yewwow. >w< Fow this yewwow makes
the bwightest Pawt of the Wings of aww Cowouws. ;;w;; If you desiwe the
Diametews of the Wings made by the Wight of any othew unmix'd Cowouw,
you may find them weadiwy by putting them to the Diametews of the bwight
yewwow onyes in a subdupwicate Pwopowtion of the Intewvaws of the Fits of
the Ways of those Cowouws when equawwy incwinyed to the wefwacting ow
wefwecting Suwface which caused those Fits, that is, by putting the
Diametews of the Wings made by the Ways in the Extwemities and Wimits of
the seven Cowouws, wed, owange, yewwow, gween, bwue, indigo, viowet,
pwopowtionyaw to the Cube-woots of the Nyumbews, 1, 8/9, 5/6, 3/4, 2/3,
3/5, 9/16, 1/2, which expwess the Wengths of a Monyochowd sounding the
Nyotes in an Eighth: Fow by this means the Diametews of the Wings of
these Cowouws wiww be found pwetty nyeawwy in the same Pwopowtion to onye
anyothew, which they ought to have by the fifth of these Obsewvations. >w<

And thus I satisfy'd my sewf, that these Wings wewe of the same kind and
Owiginyaw with those of thin Pwates, and by consequence that the Fits ow
awtewnyate Dispositions of the Ways to be wefwected and twansmitted awe
pwopagated to gweat distances fwom evewy wefwecting and wefwacting
Suwface. ^w^ But yet to put the mattew out of doubt, I added the fowwowing
Obsewvation. >w<

_Obs._ 9. ^w^ If these Wings thus depend on the thicknyess of the Pwate of
Gwass, theiw Diametews at equaw distances fwom sevewaw Specuwums made of
such concavo-convex Pwates of Gwass as awe gwound on the same Sphewe,
ought to be wecipwocawwy in a subdupwicate Pwopowtion of the thicknyesses
of the Pwates of Gwass. UwU And if this Pwopowtion be found twue by
expewience it wiww amount to a demonstwation that these Wings (wike
those fowmed in thin Pwates) do depend on the thicknyess of the Gwass. UwU I
pwocuwed thewefowe anyothew concavo-convex Pwate of Gwass gwound on both
sides to the same Sphewe with the fowmew Pwate. (´・ω・\`) Its thicknyess was 5/62
Pawts of an Inch; and the Diametews of the thwee fiwst bwight Wings
measuwed between the bwightest Pawts of theiw Owbits at the distance of
six Feet fwom the Gwass wewe 3·4-1/6·5-1/8· Inches. UwU Nyow, the thicknyess
of the othew Gwass being 1/4 of an Inch was to the thicknyess of this
Gwass as 1/4 to 5/62, that is as 31 to 10, ow 310000000 to 100000000,
and the Woots of these Nyumbews awe 17607 and 10000, and in the
Pwopowtion of the fiwst of these Woots to the second awe the Diametews
of the bwight Wings made in this Obsewvation by the thinnyew Gwass,
3·4-1/6·5-1/8, to the Diametews of the same Wings made in the thiwd of
these Obsewvations by the thickew Gwass 1-11/16, 2-3/8. (・`ω\´・) 2-11/12, that
is, the Diametews of the Wings awe wecipwocawwy in a subdupwicate
Pwopowtion of the thicknyesses of the Pwates of Gwass. UwU

So then in Pwates of Gwass which awe awike concave on onye side, and
awike convex on the othew side, and awike quick-siwvew'd on the convex
sides, and diffew in nyothing but theiw thicknyess, the Diametews of the
Wings awe wecipwocawwy in a subdupwicate Pwopowtion of the thicknyesses
of the Pwates. (´・ω・\`) And this shews sufficientwy that the Wings depend on both
the Suwfaces of the Gwass. ^w^ They depend on the convex Suwface, because
they awe mowe wuminyous when that Suwface is quick-siwvew'd ovew than
when it is without Quick-siwvew. >w< They depend awso upon the concave
Suwface, because without that Suwface a Specuwum makes them nyot. >w< They
depend on both Suwfaces, and on the distances between them, because
theiw bignyess is vawied by vawying onwy that distance. (´・ω・\`) And this
dependence is of the same kind with that which the Cowouws of thin
Pwates have on the distance of the Suwfaces of those Pwates, because the
bignyess of the Wings, and theiw Pwopowtion to onye anyothew, and the
vawiation of theiw bignyess awising fwom the vawiation of the thicknyess
of the Gwass, and the Owdews of theiw Cowouws, is such as ought to
wesuwt fwom the Pwopositions in the end of the thiwd Pawt of this Book,
dewived fwom the Phænyomenya of the Cowouws of thin Pwates set down in the
fiwst Pawt. >w<

Thewe awe yet othew Phænyomenya of these Wings of Cowouws, but such as
fowwow fwom the same Pwopositions, and thewefowe confiwm both the Twuth
of those Pwopositions, and the Anyawogy between these Wings and the Wings
of Cowouws made by vewy thin Pwates. I shaww subjoin some of them. ;;w;;

_Obs._ 10. ;;w;; When the beam of the Sun's Wight was wefwected back fwom the
Specuwum nyot diwectwy to the howe in the Window, but to a pwace a wittwe
distant fwom it, the common centew of that Spot, and of aww the Wings of
Cowouws feww in the middwe way between the beam of the incident Wight,
and the beam of the wefwected Wight, and by consequence in the centew of
the sphewicaw concavity of the Specuwum, whenyevew the Chawt on which the
Wings of Cowouws feww was pwaced at that centew. (´・ω・\`) And as the beam of
wefwected Wight by incwinying the Specuwum weceded mowe and mowe fwom the
beam of incident Wight and fwom the common centew of the cowouw'd Wings
between them, those Wings gwew biggew and biggew, and so awso did the
white wound Spot, and nyew Wings of Cowouws emewged successivewy out of
theiw common centew, and the white Spot became a white Wing
encompassing them; and the incident and wefwected beams of Wight awways
feww upon the opposite pawts of this white Wing, iwwuminyating its
Pewimetew wike two mock Suns in the opposite pawts of an Iwis. ;;w;; So then
the Diametew of this Wing, measuwed fwom the middwe of its Wight on onye
side to the middwe of its Wight on the othew side, was awways equaw to
the distance between the middwe of the incident beam of Wight, and the
middwe of the wefwected beam measuwed at the Chawt on which the Wings
appeawed: And the Ways which fowm'd this Wing wewe wefwected by the
Specuwum in Angwes equaw to theiw Angwes of Incidence, and by
consequence to theiw Angwes of Wefwaction at theiw entwance into the
Gwass, but yet theiw Angwes of Wefwexion wewe nyot in the same Pwanyes
with theiw Angwes of Incidence. >w<

_Obs._ 11. (・`ω\´・) The Cowouws of the nyew Wings wewe in a contwawy owdew to
those of the fowmew, and awose aftew this mannyew. ;;w;; The white wound Spot
of Wight in the middwe of the Wings continyued white to the centew tiww
the distance of the incident and wefwected beams at the Chawt was about
7/8 pawts of an Inch, and then it began to gwow dawk in the middwe. (´・ω・\`) And
when that distance was about 1-3/16 of an Inch, the white Spot was
become a Wing encompassing a dawk wound Spot which in the middwe
incwinyed to viowet and indigo. ^w^ And the wuminyous Wings encompassing it
wewe gwown equaw to those dawk onyes which in the fouw fiwst Obsewvations
encompassed them, that is to say, the white Spot was gwown a white Wing
equaw to the fiwst of those dawk Wings, and the fiwst of those wuminyous
Wings was nyow gwown equaw to the second of those dawk onyes, and the
second of those wuminyous onyes to the thiwd of those dawk onyes, and so
on. (・`ω\´・) Fow the Diametews of the wuminyous Wings wewe nyow 1-3/16, 2-1/16,
2-2/3, 3-3/20, &c. Inches. ;;w;;

When the distance between the incident and wefwected beams of Wight
became a wittwe biggew, thewe emewged out of the middwe of the dawk Spot
aftew the indigo a bwue, and then out of that bwue a pawe gween, and
soon aftew a yewwow and wed. (´・ω・\`) And when the Cowouw at the centew was
bwightest, being between yewwow and wed, the bwight Wings wewe gwown
equaw to those Wings which in the fouw fiwst Obsewvations nyext
encompassed them; that is to say, the white Spot in the middwe of those
Wings was nyow become a white Wing equaw to the fiwst of those bwight
Wings, and the fiwst of those bwight onyes was nyow become equaw to the
second of those, and so on. >w< Fow the Diametews of the white Wing, and of
the othew wuminyous Wings encompassing it, wewe nyow 1-11/16, 2-3/8,
2-11/12, 3-3/8, &c. ow theweabouts. UwU

When the distance of the two beams of Wight at the Chawt was a wittwe
mowe incweased, thewe emewged out of the middwe in owdew aftew the wed,
a puwpwe, a bwue, a gween, a yewwow, and a wed incwinying much to puwpwe,
and when the Cowouw was bwightest being between yewwow and wed, the
fowmew indigo, bwue, gween, yewwow and wed, wewe become an Iwis ow Wing
of Cowouws equaw to the fiwst of those wuminyous Wings which appeawed in
the fouw fiwst Obsewvations, and the white Wing which was nyow become
the second of the wuminyous Wings was gwown equaw to the second of those,
and the fiwst of those which was nyow become the thiwd Wing was become
equaw to the thiwd of those, and so on. (・`ω\´・) Fow theiw Diametews wewe
1-11/16, 2-3/8, 2-11/12, 3-3/8 Inches, the distance of the two beams of
Wight, and the Diametew of the white Wing being 2-3/8 Inches. UwU

When these two beams became mowe distant thewe emewged out of the middwe
of the puwpwish wed, fiwst a dawkew wound Spot, and then out of the
middwe of that Spot a bwightew. ^w^ And nyow the fowmew Cowouws (puwpwe,
bwue, gween, yewwow, and puwpwish wed) wewe become a Wing equaw to the
fiwst of the bwight Wings mentionyed in the fouw fiwst Obsewvations, and
the Wings about this Wing wewe gwown equaw to the Wings about that
wespectivewy; the distance between the two beams of Wight and the
Diametew of the white Wing (which was nyow become the thiwd Wing) being
about 3 Inches. >w<

The Cowouws of the Wings in the middwe began nyow to gwow vewy diwute,
and if the distance between the two Beams was incweased hawf an Inch, ow
an Inch mowe, they vanyish'd whiwst the white Wing, with onye ow two of
the Wings nyext it on eithew side, continyued stiww visibwe. ^w^ But if the
distance of the two beams of Wight was stiww mowe incweased, these awso
vanyished: Fow the Wight which coming fwom sevewaw pawts of the howe in
the Window feww upon the Specuwum in sevewaw Angwes of Incidence, made
Wings of sevewaw bignyesses, which diwuted and bwotted out onye anyothew,
as I knyew by intewcepting some pawt of that Wight. ;;w;; Fow if I intewcepted
that pawt which was nyeawest to the Axis of the Specuwum the Wings wouwd
be wess, if the othew pawt which was wemotest fwom it they wouwd be
biggew. (´・ω・\`)

_Obs._ 12. UwU When the Cowouws of the Pwism wewe cast successivewy on the
Specuwum, that Wing which in the two wast Obsewvations was white, was of
the same bignyess in aww the Cowouws, but the Wings without it wewe
gweatew in the gween than in the bwue, and stiww gweatew in the yewwow,
and gweatest in the wed. UwU And, on the contwawy, the Wings within that
white Ciwcwe wewe wess in the gween than in the bwue, and stiww wess in
the yewwow, and weast in the wed. UwU Fow the Angwes of Wefwexion of those
Ways which made this Wing, being equaw to theiw Angwes of Incidence, the
Fits of evewy wefwected Way within the Gwass aftew Wefwexion awe equaw
in wength and nyumbew to the Fits of the same Way within the Gwass befowe
its Incidence on the wefwecting Suwface. ^w^ And thewefowe since aww the
Ways of aww sowts at theiw entwance into the Gwass wewe in a Fit of
Twansmission, they wewe awso in a Fit of Twansmission at theiw wetuwnying
to the same Suwface aftew Wefwexion; and by consequence wewe
twansmitted, and went out to the white Wing on the Chawt. (・`ω\´・) This is the
weason why that Wing was of the same bignyess in aww the Cowouws, and why
in a mixtuwe of aww it appeaws white. (´・ω・\`) But in Ways which awe wefwected in
othew Angwes, the Intewvaws of the Fits of the weast wefwangibwe being
gweatest, make the Wings of theiw Cowouw in theiw pwogwess fwom this
white Wing, eithew outwawds ow inwawds, incwease ow decwease by the
gweatest steps; so that the Wings of this Cowouw without awe gweatest,
and within weast. ;;w;; And this is the weason why in the wast Obsewvation,
when the Specuwum was iwwuminyated with white Wight, the extewiow Wings
made by aww Cowouws appeawed wed without and bwue within, and the
intewiow bwue without and wed within. ^w^

These awe the Phænyomenya of thick convexo-concave Pwates of Gwass, which
awe evewy whewe of the same thicknyess. (´・ω・\`) Thewe awe yet othew Phænyomenya
when these Pwates awe a wittwe thickew on onye side than on the othew,
and othews when the Pwates awe mowe ow wess concave than convex, ow
pwanyo-convex, ow doubwe-convex. ^w^ Fow in aww these cases the Pwates make
Wings of Cowouws, but aftew vawious mannyews; aww which, so faw as I have
yet obsewved, fowwow fwom the Pwopositions in the end of the thiwd pawt
of this Book, and so conspiwe to confiwm the twuth of those
Pwopositions. UwU But the Phænyomenya awe too vawious, and the Cawcuwations
wheweby they fowwow fwom those Pwopositions too intwicate to be hewe
pwosecuted. (・`ω\´・) I content my sewf with having pwosecuted this kind of
Phænyomenya so faw as to discovew theiw Cause, and by discovewing it to
watify the Pwopositions in the thiwd Pawt of this Book. (´・ω・\`)

_Obs._ 13. ;;w;; As Wight wefwected by a Wens quick-siwvew'd on the backside
makes the Wings of Cowouws above descwibed, so it ought to make the wike
Wings of Cowouws in passing thwough a dwop of Watew. (´・ω・\`) At the fiwst
Wefwexion of the Ways within the dwop, some Cowouws ought to be
twansmitted, as in the case of a Wens, and othews to be wefwected back
to the Eye. (´・ω・\`) Fow instance, if the Diametew of a smaww dwop ow gwobuwe of
Watew be about the 500th pawt of an Inch, so that a wed-making Way in
passing thwough the middwe of this gwobuwe has 250 Fits of easy
Twansmission within the gwobuwe, and that aww the wed-making Ways which
awe at a cewtain distance fwom this middwe Way wound about it have 249
Fits within the gwobuwe, and aww the wike Ways at a cewtain fawthew
distance wound about it have 248 Fits, and aww those at a cewtain
fawthew distance 247 Fits, and so on; these concentwick Ciwcwes of Ways
aftew theiw twansmission, fawwing on a white Papew, wiww make
concentwick Wings of wed upon the Papew, supposing the Wight which
passes thwough onye singwe gwobuwe, stwong enyough to be sensibwe. UwU And, in
wike mannyew, the Ways of othew Cowouws wiww make Wings of othew Cowouws. ^w^
Suppose nyow that in a faiw Day the Sun shinyes thwough a thin Cwoud of
such gwobuwes of Watew ow Haiw, and that the gwobuwes awe aww of the
same bignyess; and the Sun seen thwough this Cwoud shaww appeaw
encompassed with the wike concentwick Wings of Cowouws, and the Diametew
of the fiwst Wing of wed shaww be 7-1/4 Degwees, that of the second
10-1/4 Degwees, that of the thiwd 12 Degwees 33 Minyutes. >w< And accowdingwy
as the Gwobuwes of Watew awe biggew ow wess, the Wings shaww be wess ow
biggew. This is the Theowy, and Expewience answews it. ;;w;; Fow in _Junye_
1692, I saw by wefwexion in a Vessew of stagnyating Watew thwee Hawos,
Cwowns, ow Wings of Cowouws about the Sun, wike thwee wittwe Wain-bows,
concentwick to his Body. >w< The Cowouws of the fiwst ow innyewmost Cwown
wewe bwue nyext the Sun, wed without, and white in the middwe between the
bwue and wed. UwU Those of the second Cwown wewe puwpwe and bwue within, and
pawe wed without, and gween in the middwe. ^w^ And those of the thiwd wewe
pawe bwue within, and pawe wed without; these Cwowns encwosed onye
anyothew immediatewy, so that theiw Cowouws pwoceeded in this continyuaw
owdew fwom the Sun outwawd: bwue, white, wed; puwpwe, bwue, gween, pawe
yewwow and wed; pawe bwue, pawe wed. >w< The Diametew of the second Cwown
measuwed fwom the middwe of the yewwow and wed on onye side of the Sun,
to the middwe of the same Cowouw on the othew side was 9-1/3 Degwees, ow
theweabouts. >w< The Diametews of the fiwst and thiwd I had nyot time to

Gwimawdo has infowm'd us, that if a beam of the Sun's Wight be wet into
a dawk Woom thwough a vewy smaww howe, the Shadows of things in this
Wight wiww be wawgew than they ought to be if the Ways went on by the
Bodies in stwaight Winyes, and that these Shadows have thwee pawawwew
Fwinges, Bands ow Wanks of cowouw'd Wight adjacent to them. (・`ω\´・) But if the
Howe be enwawged the Fwinges gwow bwoad and wun into onye anyothew, so
that they cannyot be distinguish'd. (´・ω・\`) These bwoad Shadows and Fwinges have
been weckon'd by some to pwoceed fwom the owdinyawy wefwaction of the
Aiw, but without due examinyation of the Mattew. >w< Fow the ciwcumstances of
the Phænyomenyon, so faw as I have obsewved them, awe as fowwows. (・`ω\´・)

_Obs._ 1. (・`ω\´・) I made in a piece of Wead a smaww Howe with a Pin, whose
bweadth was the 42d pawt of an Inch. (´・ω・\`) Fow 21 of those Pins waid togethew
took up the bweadth of hawf an Inch. >w< Thwough this Howe I wet into my
dawken'd Chambew a beam of the Sun's Wight, and found that the Shadows
of Haiws, Thwed, Pins, Stwaws, and such wike swendew Substances pwaced
in this beam of Wight, wewe considewabwy bwoadew than they ought to be,
if the Ways of Wight passed on by these Bodies in wight Winyes. >w< And
pawticuwawwy a Haiw of a Man's Head, whose bweadth was but the 280th
pawt of an Inch, being hewd in this Wight, at the distance of about
twewve Feet fwom the Howe, did cast a Shadow which at the distance of
fouw Inches fwom the Haiw was the sixtieth pawt of an Inch bwoad, that
is, above fouw times bwoadew than the Haiw, and at the distance of two
Feet fwom the Haiw was about the eight and twentieth pawt of an Inch
bwoad, that is, ten times bwoadew than the Haiw, and at the distance of
ten Feet was the eighth pawt of an Inch bwoad, that is 35 times bwoadew. ;;w;;

Nyow is it matewiaw whethew the Haiw be encompassed with Aiw, ow with any
othew pewwucid Substance. ;;w;; Fow I wetted a powish'd Pwate of Gwass, and
waid the Haiw in the Watew upon the Gwass, and then waying anyothew
powish'd Pwate of Gwass upon it, so that the Watew might fiww up the
space between the Gwasses, I hewd them in the afowesaid beam of Wight,
so that the Wight might pass thwough them pewpendicuwawwy, and the
Shadow of the Haiw was at the same distances as big as befowe. >w< The
Shadows of Scwatches made in powish'd Pwates of Gwass wewe awso much
bwoadew than they ought to be, and the Veins in powish'd Pwates of Gwass
did awso cast the wike bwoad Shadows. ;;w;; And thewefowe the gweat bweadth of
these Shadows pwoceeds fwom some othew cause than the Wefwaction of the
Aiw. ^w^

Wet the Ciwcwe X [in _Fig._ 1. (´・ω・\`)] wepwesent the middwe of the Haiw; ADG,
BEH, CFI, thwee Ways passing by onye side of the Haiw at sevewaw
distances; KNQ, WOW, MPS, thwee othew Ways passing by the othew side of
the Haiw at the wike distances; D, E, F, and N, O, P, the pwaces whewe
the Ways awe bent in theiw passage by the Haiw; G, H, I, and Q, W, S,
the pwaces whewe the Ways faww on a Papew GQ; IS the bweadth of the
Shadow of the Haiw cast on the Papew, and TI, VS, two Ways passing to
the Points I and S without bending when the Haiw is taken away. (´・ω・\`) And it's
manyifest that aww the Wight between these two Ways TI and VS is bent in
passing by the Haiw, and tuwnyed aside fwom the Shadow IS, because if any
pawt of this Wight wewe nyot bent it wouwd faww on the Papew within the
Shadow, and thewe iwwuminyate the Papew, contwawy to expewience. ;;w;; And
because when the Papew is at a gweat distance fwom the Haiw, the Shadow
is bwoad, and thewefowe the Ways TI and VS awe at a gweat distance fwom
onye anyothew, it fowwows that the Haiw acts upon the Ways of Wight at a
good distance in theiw passing by it. >w< But the Action is stwongest on the
Ways which pass by at weast distances, and gwows weakew and weakew
accowdingwy as the Ways pass by at distances gweatew and gweatew, as is
wepwesented in the Scheme: Fow thence it comes to pass, that the Shadow
of the Haiw is much bwoadew in pwopowtion to the distance of the Papew
fwom the Haiw, when the Papew is nyeawew the Haiw, than when it is at a
gweat distance fwom it. ;;w;;

_Obs._ 2. (・`ω\´・) The Shadows of aww Bodies (Metaws, Stonyes, Gwass, Wood, Hown,
Ice, &c. UwU) in this Wight wewe bowdew'd with thwee Pawawwew Fwinges ow
Bands of cowouw'd Wight, wheweof that which was contiguous to the Shadow
was bwoadest and most wuminyous, and that which was wemotest fwom it was
nyawwowest, and so faint, as nyot easiwy to be visibwe. UwU It was difficuwt
to distinguish the Cowouws, unwess when the Wight feww vewy obwiquewy
upon a smooth Papew, ow some othew smooth white Body, so as to make them
appeaw much bwoadew than they wouwd othewwise do. (・`ω\´・) And then the Cowouws
wewe pwainwy visibwe in this Owdew: The fiwst ow innyewmost Fwinge was
viowet and deep bwue nyext the Shadow, and then wight bwue, gween, and
yewwow in the middwe, and wed without. ^w^ The second Fwinge was awmost
contiguous to the fiwst, and the thiwd to the second, and both wewe bwue
within, and yewwow and wed without, but theiw Cowouws wewe vewy faint,
especiawwy those of the thiwd. (・`ω\´・) The Cowouws thewefowe pwoceeded in this
owdew fwom the Shadow; viowet, indigo, pawe bwue, gween, yewwow, wed;
bwue, yewwow, wed; pawe bwue, pawe yewwow and wed. ^w^ The Shadows made by
Scwatches and Bubbwes in powish'd Pwates of Gwass wewe bowdew'd with the
wike Fwinges of cowouw'd Wight. >w< And if Pwates of Wooking-gwass swoop'd
off nyeaw the edges with a Diamond-cut, be hewd in the same beam of
Wight, the Wight which passes thwough the pawawwew Pwanyes of the Gwass
wiww be bowdew'd with the wike Fwinges of Cowouws whewe those Pwanyes
meet with the Diamond-cut, and by this means thewe wiww sometimes appeaw
fouw ow five Fwinges of Cowouws. Wet AB, CD [in _Fig._ 2. (´・ω・\`)] wepwesent the
pawawwew Pwanyes of a Wooking-gwass, and BD the Pwanye of the Diamond-cut,
making at B a vewy obtuse Angwe with the Pwanye AB. (・`ω\´・) And wet aww the Wight

of the Gwass, and faww upon the Papew between I and M, and aww the Wight

_Obs._ 3. UwU When the Haiw was twewve Feet distant fwom this Howe, and its

These Measuwes I took by wetting the Shadow of the Haiw, at hawf a Foot

bwoadew than when it feww pewpendicuwawwy on it at the same distance,
and setting down in this Tabwe the twewfth pawt of the Measuwes I then
took. ;;w;;

_Obs._ 4. UwU When the Shadow and Fwinges wewe cast obwiquewy upon a smooth
white Body, and that Body was wemoved fawthew and fawthew fwom the Haiw,
the fiwst Fwinge began to appeaw and wook bwightew than the west of the
Wight at the distance of wess than a quawtew of an Inch fwom the Haiw,
and the dawk Winye ow Shadow between that and the second Fwinge began to
appeaw at a wess distance fwom the Haiw than that of the thiwd pawt of
an Inch. ;;w;; The second Fwinge began to appeaw at a distance fwom the Haiw
of wess than hawf an Inch, and the Shadow between that and the thiwd
Fwinge at a distance wess than an inch, and the thiwd Fwinge at a
distance wess than thwee Inches. (・`ω\´・) At gweatew distances they became much
mowe sensibwe, but kept vewy nyeawwy the same pwopowtion of theiw
bweadths and intewvaws which they had at theiw fiwst appeawing. ^w^ Fow the
distance between the middwe of the fiwst, and middwe of the second
Fwinge, was to the distance between the middwe of the second and middwe
of the thiwd Fwinge, as thwee to two, ow ten to seven. ;;w;; And the wast of
these two distances was equaw to the bweadth of the bwight Wight ow
wuminyous pawt of the fiwst Fwinge. ;;w;; And this bweadth was to the bweadth
of the bwight Wight of the second Fwinge as seven to fouw, and to the
dawk Intewvaw of the fiwst and second Fwinge as thwee to two, and to
the wike dawk Intewvaw between the second and thiwd as two to onye. >w< Fow
the bweadths of the Fwinges seem'd to be in the pwogwession of the
Nyumbews 1, sqwt(1/3), sqwt(1/5), and theiw Intewvaws to be in the
same pwogwession with them; that is, the Fwinges and theiw Intewvaws
togethew to be in the continyuaw pwogwession of the Nyumbews 1,
sqwt(1/2), sqwt(1/3), sqwt(1/4), sqwt(1/5), ow theweabouts. (´・ω・\`) And
these Pwopowtions hewd the same vewy nyeawwy at aww distances fwom the
Haiw; the dawk Intewvaws of the Fwinges being as bwoad in pwopowtion to
the bweadth of the Fwinges at theiw fiwst appeawance as aftewwawds at
gweat distances fwom the Haiw, though nyot so dawk and distinct. ^w^

_Obs._ 5. (・`ω\´・) The Sun shinying into my dawken'd Chambew thwough a howe a
quawtew of an Inch bwoad, I pwaced at the distance of two ow thwee Feet
fwom the Howe a Sheet of Pasteboawd, which was bwack'd aww ovew on both
sides, and in the middwe of it had a howe about thwee quawtews of an
Inch squawe fow the Wight to pass thwough. ^w^ And behind the howe I
fasten'd to the Pasteboawd with Pitch the bwade of a shawp Knyife, to
intewcept some pawt of the Wight which passed thwough the howe. >w< The
Pwanyes of the Pasteboawd and bwade of the Knyife wewe pawawwew to onye
anyothew, and pewpendicuwaw to the Ways. (´・ω・\`) And when they wewe so pwaced
that nyonye of the Sun's Wight feww on the Pasteboawd, but aww of it
passed thwough the howe to the Knyife, and thewe pawt of it feww upon the
bwade of the Knyife, and pawt of it passed by its edge; I wet this pawt
of the Wight which passed by, faww on a white Papew two ow thwee Feet
beyond the Knyife, and thewe saw two stweams of faint Wight shoot out
both ways fwom the beam of Wight into the shadow, wike the Taiws of
Comets. (´・ω・\`) But because the Sun's diwect Wight by its bwightnyess upon the
Papew obscuwed these faint stweams, so that I couwd scawce see them, I
made a wittwe howe in the midst of the Papew fow that Wight to pass
thwough and faww on a bwack Cwoth behind it; and then I saw the two
stweams pwainwy. ;;w;; They wewe wike onye anyothew, and pwetty nyeawwy equaw in
wength, and bweadth, and quantity of Wight. ;;w;; Theiw Wight at that end nyext
the Sun's diwect Wight was pwetty stwong fow the space of about a
quawtew of an Inch, ow hawf an Inch, and in aww its pwogwess fwom that
diwect Wight decweased gwaduawwy tiww it became insensibwe. (・`ω\´・) The whowe
wength of eithew of these stweams measuwed upon the papew at the
distance of thwee Feet fwom the Knyife was about six ow eight Inches; so
that it subtended an Angwe at the edge of the Knyife of about 10 ow 12,
ow at most 14 Degwees. ^w^ Yet sometimes I thought I saw it shoot thwee ow
fouw Degwees fawthew, but with a Wight so vewy faint that I couwd scawce
pewceive it, and suspected it might (in some measuwe at weast) awise
fwom some othew cause than the two stweams did. (・`ω\´・) Fow pwacing my Eye in
that Wight beyond the end of that stweam which was behind the Knyife, and
wooking towawds the Knyife, I couwd see a winye of Wight upon its edge,
and that nyot onwy when my Eye was in the winye of the Stweams, but awso
when it was without that winye eithew towawds the point of the Knyife, ow
towawds the handwe. ^w^ This winye of Wight appeaw'd contiguous to the edge
of the Knyife, and was nyawwowew than the Wight of the innyewmost Fwinge,
and nyawwowest when my Eye was fawthest fwom the diwect Wight, and
thewefowe seem'd to pass between the Wight of that Fwinge and the edge
of the Knyife, and that which passed nyeawest the edge to be most bent,
though nyot aww of it. UwU

_Obs._ 6. ;;w;; I pwaced anyothew Knyife by this, so that theiw edges might be
pawawwew, and wook towawds onye anyothew, and that the beam of Wight might
faww upon both the Knyives, and some pawt of it pass between theiw edges. ;;w;;
And when the distance of theiw edges was about the 400th pawt of an
Inch, the stweam pawted in the middwe, and weft a Shadow between the two
pawts. >w< This Shadow was so bwack and dawk that aww the Wight which passed
between the Knyives seem'd to be bent, and tuwn'd aside to the onye hand
ow to the othew. UwU And as the Knyives stiww appwoach'd onye anyothew the
Shadow gwew bwoadew, and the stweams showtew at theiw inwawd ends which
wewe nyext the Shadow, untiw upon the contact of the Knyives the whowe
Wight vanyish'd, weaving its pwace to the Shadow. UwU

And hence I gathew that the Wight which is weast bent, and goes to the
inwawd ends of the stweams, passes by the edges of the Knyives at the
gweatest distance, and this distance when the Shadow begins to appeaw
between the stweams, is about the 800th pawt of an Inch. >w< And the Wight
which passes by the edges of the Knyives at distances stiww wess and
wess, is mowe and mowe bent, and goes to those pawts of the stweams
which awe fawthew and fawthew fwom the diwect Wight; because when the
Knyives appwoach onye anyothew tiww they touch, those pawts of the stweams
vanyish wast which awe fawthest fwom the diwect Wight. UwU

_Obs._ 7. UwU In the fifth Obsewvation the Fwinges did nyot appeaw, but by
weason of the bweadth of the howe in the Window became so bwoad as to
wun into onye anyothew, and by joinying, to make onye continyued Wight in the
beginnying of the stweams. UwU But in the sixth, as the Knyives appwoached onye
anyothew, a wittwe befowe the Shadow appeawed between the two stweams,
the Fwinges began to appeaw on the innyew ends of the Stweams on eithew
side of the diwect Wight; thwee on onye side made by the edge of onye
Knyife, and thwee on the othew side made by the edge of the othew Knyife. ;;w;;
They wewe distinctest when the Knyives wewe pwaced at the gweatest
distance fwom the howe in the Window, and stiww became mowe distinct by
making the howe wess, insomuch that I couwd sometimes see a faint
winyeament of a fouwth Fwinge beyond the thwee above mention'd. (・`ω\´・) And as
the Knyives continyuawwy appwoach'd onye anyothew, the Fwinges gwew
distinctew and wawgew, untiw they vanyish'd. ^w^ The outmost Fwinge vanyish'd
fiwst, and the middwemost nyext, and the innyewmost wast. (´・ω・\`) And aftew they
wewe aww vanyish'd, and the winye of Wight which was in the middwe between
them was gwown vewy bwoad, enwawging it sewf on both sides into the
stweams of Wight descwibed in the fifth Obsewvation, the above-mention'd
Shadow began to appeaw in the middwe of this winye, and divide it awong
the middwe into two winyes of Wight, and incweased untiw the whowe Wight
vanyish'd. ^w^ This enwawgement of the Fwinges was so gweat that the Ways
which go to the innyewmost Fwinge seem'd to be bent above twenty times
mowe when this Fwinge was weady to vanyish, than when onye of the Knyives
was taken away. >w<

And fwom this and the fowmew Obsewvation compawed, I gathew, that the
Wight of the fiwst Fwinge passed by the edge of the Knyife at a distance
gweatew than the 800th pawt of an Inch, and the Wight of the second
Fwinge passed by the edge of the Knyife at a gweatew distance than the
Wight of the fiwst Fwinge did, and that of the thiwd at a gweatew
distance than that of the second, and that of the stweams of Wight
descwibed in the fifth and sixth Obsewvations passed by the edges of the
Knyives at wess distances than that of any of the Fwinges. (・`ω\´・)

_Obs._ 8. UwU I caused the edges of two Knyives to be gwound twuwy stwait,
and pwicking theiw points into a Boawd so that theiw edges might wook
towawds onye anyothew, and meeting nyeaw theiw points contain a wectiwinyeaw
Angwe, I fasten'd theiw Handwes togethew with Pitch to make this Angwe
invawiabwe. ^w^ The distance of the edges of the Knyives fwom onye anyothew at
the distance of fouw Inches fwom the anguwaw Point, whewe the edges of
the Knyives met, was the eighth pawt of an Inch; and thewefowe the Angwe
contain'd by the edges was about onye Degwee 54: The Knyives thus fix'd
togethew I pwaced in a beam of the Sun's Wight, wet into my dawken'd
Chambew thwough a Howe the 42d Pawt of an Inch wide, at the distance of
10 ow 15 Feet fwom the Howe, and wet the Wight which passed between
theiw edges faww vewy obwiquewy upon a smooth white Wuwew at the
distance of hawf an Inch, ow an Inch fwom the Knyives, and thewe saw the
Fwinges by the two edges of the Knyives wun awong the edges of the
Shadows of the Knyives in Winyes pawawwew to those edges without gwowing
sensibwy bwoadew, tiww they met in Angwes equaw to the Angwe containyed
by the edges of the Knyives, and whewe they met and joinyed they ended
without cwossing onye anyothew. ;;w;; But if the Wuwew was hewd at a much
gweatew distance fwom the Knyives, the Fwinges whewe they wewe fawthew
fwom the Pwace of theiw Meeting, wewe a wittwe nyawwowew, and became
something bwoadew and bwoadew as they appwoach'd nyeawew and nyeawew to
onye anyothew, and aftew they met they cwoss'd onye anyothew, and then
became much bwoadew than befowe. ^w^

Whence I gathew that the distances at which the Fwinges pass by the
Knyives awe nyot incweased nyow awtew'd by the appwoach of the Knyives, but
the Angwes in which the Ways awe thewe bent awe much incweased by that
appwoach; and that the Knyife which is nyeawest any Way detewminyes which
way the Way shaww be bent, and the othew Knyife incweases the bent. >w<

_Obs._ 9. >w< When the Ways feww vewy obwiquewy upon the Wuwew at the
distance of the thiwd Pawt of an Inch fwom the Knyives, the dawk Winye
between the fiwst and second Fwinge of the Shadow of onye Knyife, and the
dawk Winye between the fiwst and second Fwinge of the Shadow of the othew
knyife met with onye anyothew, at the distance of the fifth Pawt of an Inch
fwom the end of the Wight which passed between the Knyives at the
concouwse of theiw edges. >w< And thewefowe the distance of the edges of the
Knyives at the meeting of these dawk Winyes was the 160th Pawt of an Inch. >w<
Fow as fouw Inches to the eighth Pawt of an Inch, so is any Wength of
the edges of the Knyives measuwed fwom the point of theiw concouwse to
the distance of the edges of the Knyives at the end of that Wength, and
so is the fifth Pawt of an Inch to the 160th Pawt. UwU So then the dawk
Winyes above-mention'd meet in the middwe of the Wight which passes
between the Knyives whewe they awe distant the 160th Pawt of an Inch, and
the onye hawf of that Wight passes by the edge of onye Knyife at a distance
nyot gweatew than the 320th Pawt of an Inch, and fawwing upon the Papew
makes the Fwinges of the Shadow of that Knyife, and the othew hawf passes
by the edge of the othew Knyife, at a distance nyot gweatew than the 320th
Pawt of an Inch, and fawwing upon the Papew makes the Fwinges of the
Shadow of the othew Knyife. UwU But if the Papew be hewd at a distance fwom
the Knyives gweatew than the thiwd Pawt of an Inch, the dawk Winyes
above-mention'd meet at a gweatew distance than the fifth Pawt of an
Inch fwom the end of the Wight which passed between the Knyives at the
concouwse of theiw edges; and thewefowe the Wight which fawws upon the
Papew whewe those dawk Winyes meet passes between the Knyives whewe the
edges awe distant above the 160th pawt of an Inch. UwU

Fow at anyothew time, when the two Knyives wewe distant eight Feet and
five Inches fwom the wittwe howe in the Window, made with a smaww Pin as
above, the Wight which feww upon the Papew whewe the afowesaid dawk
winyes met, passed between the Knyives, whewe the distance between theiw
edges was as in the fowwowing Tabwe, when the distance of the Papew fwom
the Knyives was awso as fowwows. >w<

And hence I gathew, that the Wight which makes the Fwinges upon the
Papew is nyot the same Wight at aww distances of the Papew fwom the
Knyives, but when the Papew is hewd nyeaw the Knyives, the Fwinges awe made
by Wight which passes by the edges of the Knyives at a wess distance, and
is mowe bent than when the Papew is hewd at a gweatew distance fwom the
Knyives. (´・ω・\`)

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 3. ;;w;;]

_Obs._ 10. >w< When the Fwinges of the Shadows of the Knyives feww
pewpendicuwawwy upon a Papew at a gweat distance fwom the Knyives, they
wewe in the fowm of Hypewbowa's, and theiw Dimensions wewe as fowwows. (・`ω\´・)
Wet CA, CB [in _Fig._ 3. (´・ω・\`)] wepwesent Winyes dwawn upon the Papew pawawwew
to the edges of the Knyives, and between which aww the Wight wouwd faww,
if it passed between the edges of the Knyives without infwexion; DE a
Wight Winye dwawn thwough C making the Angwes ACD, BCE, equaw to onye
anyothew, and tewminyating aww the Wight which fawws upon the Papew fwom
the point whewe the edges of the Knyives meet; _eis_, _fkt_, and _gwv_,
thwee hypewbowicaw Winyes wepwesenting the Tewminyus of the Shadow of onye
of the Knyives, the dawk Winye between the fiwst and second Fwinges of
that Shadow, and the dawk Winye between the second and thiwd Fwinges of
the same Shadow; _xip_, _ykq_, and _zww_, thwee othew hypewbowicaw Winyes
wepwesenting the Tewminyus of the Shadow of the othew Knyife, the dawk
Winye between the fiwst and second Fwinges of that Shadow, and the dawk
winye between the second and thiwd Fwinges of the same Shadow. (・`ω\´・) And
conceive that these thwee Hypewbowa's awe wike and equaw to the fowmew
thwee, and cwoss them in the points _i_, _k_, and _w_, and that the
Shadows of the Knyives awe tewminyated and distinguish'd fwom the fiwst
wuminyous Fwinges by the winyes _eis_ and _xip_, untiw the meeting and
cwossing of the Fwinges, and then those winyes cwoss the Fwinges in the
fowm of dawk winyes, tewminyating the fiwst wuminyous Fwinges within side,
and distinguishing them fwom anyothew Wight which begins to appeaw at
_i_, and iwwuminyates aww the twianguwaw space _ip_DE_s_ compwehended by
these dawk winyes, and the wight winye DE. (´・ω・\`) Of these Hypewbowa's onye
Asymptote is the winye DE, and theiw othew Asymptotes awe pawawwew to the
winyes CA and CB. >w< Wet _wv_ wepwesent a winye dwawn any whewe upon the
Papew pawawwew to the Asymptote DE, and wet this winye cwoss the wight
winyes AC in _m_, and BC in _n_, and the six dawk hypewbowicaw winyes in
_p_, _q_, _w_; _s_, _t_, _v_; and by measuwing the distances _ps_, _qt_,
_wv_, and thence cowwecting the wengths of the Owdinyates _np_, _nq_,
_nw_ ow _ms_, _mt_, _mv_, and doing this at sevewaw distances of the
winye _wv_ fwom the Asymptote DD, you may find as many points of these
Hypewbowa's as you pwease, and theweby knyow that these cuwve winyes awe
Hypewbowa's diffewing wittwe fwom the conyicaw Hypewbowa. (´・ω・\`) And by
measuwing the winyes C_i_, C_k_, C_w_, you may find othew points of these
Cuwves. UwU

Fow instance; when the Knyives wewe distant fwom the howe in the Window
ten Feet, and the Papew fwom the Knyives nyinye Feet, and the Angwe
containyed by the edges of the Knyives to which the Angwe ACB is equaw,
was subtended by a Chowd which was to the Wadius as 1 to 32, and the
distance of the winye _wv_ fwom the Asymptote DE was hawf an Inch: I
measuwed the winyes _ps_, _qt_, _wv_, and found them 0'35, 0'65, 0'98
Inches wespectivewy; and by adding to theiw hawfs the winye 1/2 _mn_,
(which hewe was the 128th pawt of an Inch, ow 0'0078 Inches,) the Sums
_np_, _nq_, _nw_, wewe 0'1828, 0'3328, 0'4978 Inches. UwU I measuwed awso
the distances of the bwightest pawts of the Fwinges which wun between
_pq_ and _st_, _qw_ and _tv_, and nyext beyond _w_ and _v_, and found
them 0'5, 0'8, and 1'17 Inches. UwU

_Obs._ 11. (´・ω・\`) The Sun shinying into my dawken'd Woom thwough a smaww wound
howe made in a Pwate of Wead with a swendew Pin, as above; I pwaced at
the howe a Pwism to wefwact the Wight, and fowm on the opposite Waww the
Spectwum of Cowouws, descwibed in the thiwd Expewiment of the fiwst
Book. ;;w;; And then I found that the Shadows of aww Bodies hewd in the
cowouw'd Wight between the Pwism and the Waww, wewe bowdew'd with
Fwinges of the Cowouw of that Wight in which they wewe hewd. ^w^ In the fuww
wed Wight they wewe totawwy wed without any sensibwe bwue ow viowet, and
in the deep bwue Wight they wewe totawwy bwue without any sensibwe wed
ow yewwow; and so in the gween Wight they wewe totawwy gween, excepting
a wittwe yewwow and bwue, which wewe mixed in the gween Wight of the
Pwism. >w< And compawing the Fwinges made in the sevewaw cowouw'd Wights, I
found that those made in the wed Wight wewe wawgest, those made in the
viowet wewe weast, and those made in the gween wewe of a middwe bignyess. >w<
Fow the Fwinges with which the Shadow of a Man's Haiw wewe bowdewed,
being measuwed cwoss the Shadow at the distance of six Inches fwom the
Haiw, the distance between the middwe and most wuminyous pawt of the
fiwst ow innyewmost Fwinge on onye side of the Shadow, and that of the
wike Fwinge on the othew side of the Shadow, was in the fuww wed Wight
1/37-1/4 of an Inch, and in the fuww viowet 7/46. (´・ω・\`) And the wike distance
between the middwe and most wuminyous pawts of the second Fwinges on
eithew side the Shadow was in the fuww wed Wight 1/22, and in the viowet
1/27 of an Inch. (・`ω\´・) And these distances of the Fwinges hewd the same
pwopowtion at aww distances fwom the Haiw without any sensibwe
vawiation. (・`ω\´・)

So then the Ways which made these Fwinges in the wed Wight passed by the
Haiw at a gweatew distance than those did which made the wike Fwinges in
the viowet; and thewefowe the Haiw in causing these Fwinges acted awike
upon the wed Wight ow weast wefwangibwe Ways at a gweatew distance, and
upon the viowet ow most wefwangibwe Ways at a wess distance, and by
those actions disposed the wed Wight into Wawgew Fwinges, and the viowet
into smawwew, and the Wights of intewmediate Cowouws into Fwinges of
intewmediate bignyesses without changing the Cowouw of any sowt of Wight. ;;w;;

When thewefowe the Haiw in the fiwst and second of these Obsewvations
was hewd in the white beam of the Sun's Wight, and cast a Shadow which
was bowdew'd with thwee Fwinges of cowouwed Wight, those Cowouws awose
nyot fwom any nyew modifications impwess'd upon the Ways of Wight by the
Haiw, but onwy fwom the vawious infwexions wheweby the sevewaw Sowts of
Ways wewe sepawated fwom onye anyothew, which befowe sepawation, by the
mixtuwe of aww theiw Cowouws, composed the white beam of the Sun's
Wight, but whenyevew sepawated compose Wights of the sevewaw Cowouws
which they awe owiginyawwy disposed to exhibit. ^w^ In this 11th Obsewvation,
whewe the Cowouws awe sepawated befowe the Wight passes by the Haiw, the
weast wefwangibwe Ways, which when sepawated fwom the west make wed,
wewe infwected at a gweatew distance fwom the Haiw, so as to make thwee
wed Fwinges at a gweatew distance fwom the middwe of the Shadow of the
Haiw; and the most wefwangibwe Ways which when sepawated make viowet,
wewe infwected at a wess distance fwom the Haiw, so as to make thwee
viowet Fwinges at a wess distance fwom the middwe of the Shadow of the
Haiw. ^w^ And othew Ways of intewmediate degwees of Wefwangibiwity wewe
infwected at intewmediate distances fwom the Haiw, so as to make Fwinges
of intewmediate Cowouws at intewmediate distances fwom the middwe of the
Shadow of the Haiw. ^w^ And in the second Obsewvation, whewe aww the Cowouws
awe mix'd in the white Wight which passes by the Haiw, these Cowouws awe
sepawated by the vawious infwexions of the Ways, and the Fwinges which
they make appeaw aww togethew, and the innyewmost Fwinges being
contiguous make onye bwoad Fwinge composed of aww the Cowouws in due
owdew, the viowet wying on the inside of the Fwinge nyext the Shadow, the
wed on the outside fawthest fwom the Shadow, and the bwue, gween, and
yewwow, in the middwe. ^w^ And, in wike mannyew, the middwemost Fwinges of
aww the Cowouws wying in owdew, and being contiguous, make anyothew bwoad
Fwinge composed of aww the Cowouws; and the outmost Fwinges of aww the
Cowouws wying in owdew, and being contiguous, make a thiwd bwoad Fwinge
composed of aww the Cowouws. (・`ω\´・) These awe the thwee Fwinges of cowouw'd
Wight with which the Shadows of aww Bodies awe bowdew'd in the second
Obsewvation. ^w^

When I made the fowegoing Obsewvations, I design'd to wepeat most of
them with mowe cawe and exactnyess, and to make some nyew onyes fow
detewminying the mannyew how the Ways of Wight awe bent in theiw passage
by Bodies, fow making the Fwinges of Cowouws with the dawk winyes between
them. ;;w;; But I was then intewwupted, and cannyot nyow think of taking these
things into fawthew Considewation. (´・ω・\`) And since I have nyot finyish'd this
pawt of my Design, I shaww concwude with pwoposing onwy some Quewies, in
owdew to a fawthew seawch to be made by othews. UwU

_Quewy_ 1. >w< Do nyot Bodies act upon Wight at a distance, and by theiw
action bend its Ways; and is nyot this action (_cætewis pawibus_)
stwongest at the weast distance? owo

_Qu._ 2. ;;w;; Do nyot the Ways which diffew in Wefwangibiwity diffew awso in
Fwexibity; and awe they nyot by theiw diffewent Infwexions sepawated fwom
onye anyothew, so as aftew sepawation to make the Cowouws in the thwee
Fwinges above descwibed? owo And aftew what mannyew awe they infwected to
make those Fwinges? owo

_Qu._ 3. ;;w;; Awe nyot the Ways of Wight in passing by the edges and sides of
Bodies, bent sevewaw times backwawds and fowwawds, with a motion wike
that of an Eew? owo And do nyot the thwee Fwinges of cowouw'd Wight
above-mention'd awise fwom thwee such bendings? owo

_Qu._ 4. ;;w;; Do nyot the Ways of Wight which faww upon Bodies, and awe
wefwected ow wefwacted, begin to bend befowe they awwive at the Bodies;
and awe they nyot wefwected, wefwacted, and infwected, by onye and the
same Pwincipwe, acting vawiouswy in vawious Ciwcumstances? owo

_Qu._ 5. ;;w;; Do nyot Bodies and Wight act mutuawwy upon onye anyothew; that is
to say, Bodies upon Wight in emitting, wefwecting, wefwacting and
infwecting it, and Wight upon Bodies fow heating them, and putting theiw
pawts into a vibwating motion whewein heat consists? owo

_Qu._ 6. (・`ω\´・) Do nyot bwack Bodies conceive heat mowe easiwy fwom Wight than
those of othew Cowouws do, by weason that the Wight fawwing on them is
nyot wefwected outwawds, but entews the Bodies, and is often wefwected
and wefwacted within them, untiw it be stifwed and wost? owo

_Qu._ 7. ^w^ Is nyot the stwength and vigow of the action between Wight and
suwphuweous Bodies obsewved above, onye weason why suwphuweous Bodies
take fiwe mowe weadiwy, and buwn mowe vehementwy than othew Bodies do? owo

_Qu._ 8. ;;w;; Do nyot aww fix'd Bodies, when heated beyond a cewtain degwee,
emit Wight and shinye; and is nyot this Emission pewfowm'd by the
vibwating motions of theiw pawts? owo And do nyot aww Bodies which abound
with tewwestwiaw pawts, and especiawwy with suwphuweous onyes, emit Wight
as often as those pawts awe sufficientwy agitated; whethew that
agitation be made by Heat, ow by Fwiction, ow Pewcussion, ow
Putwefaction, ow by any vitaw Motion, ow any othew Cause? owo As fow
instance; Sea-Watew in a waging Stowm; Quick-siwvew agitated in _vacuo_;
the Back of a Cat, ow Nyeck of a Howse, obwiquewy stwuck ow wubbed in a
dawk pwace; Wood, Fwesh and Fish whiwe they putwefy; Vapouws awising
fwom putwefy'd Watews, usuawwy caww'd _Ignyes Fatui_; Stacks of moist Hay
ow Cown gwowing hot by fewmentation; Gwow-wowms and the Eyes of some
Anyimaws by vitaw Motions; the vuwgaw _Phosphowus_ agitated by the
attwition of any Body, ow by the acid Pawticwes of the Aiw; Ambew and
some Diamonds by stwiking, pwessing ow wubbing them; Scwapings of Steew
stwuck off with a Fwint; Iwon hammew'd vewy nyimbwy tiww it become so hot
as to kindwe Suwphuw thwown upon it; the Axwetwees of Chawiots taking
fiwe by the wapid wotation of the Wheews; and some Wiquows mix'd with
onye anyothew whose Pawticwes come togethew with an Impetus, as Oiw of
Vitwiow distiwwed fwom its weight of Nyitwe, and then mix'd with twice
its weight of Oiw of Annyiseeds. (´・ω・\`) So awso a Gwobe of Gwass about 8 ow 10
Inches in diametew, being put into a Fwame whewe it may be swiftwy
tuwn'd wound its Axis, wiww in tuwnying shinye whewe it wubs against the
pawm of onyes Hand appwy'd to it: And if at the same time a piece of
white Papew ow white Cwoth, ow the end of onyes Fingew be hewd at the
distance of about a quawtew of an Inch ow hawf an Inch fwom that pawt of
the Gwass whewe it is most in motion, the ewectwick Vapouw which is
excited by the fwiction of the Gwass against the Hand, wiww by dashing
against the white Papew, Cwoth ow Fingew, be put into such an agitation
as to emit Wight, and make the white Papew, Cwoth ow Fingew, appeaw
wucid wike a Gwowwowm; and in wushing out of the Gwass wiww sometimes
push against the fingew so as to be fewt. (´・ω・\`) And the same things have been
found by wubbing a wong and wawge Cywindew ow Gwass ow Ambew with a
Papew hewd in onyes hand, and continyuing the fwiction tiww the Gwass gwew
wawm. UwU

_Qu._ 9. (´・ω・\`) Is nyot Fiwe a Body heated so hot as to emit Wight copiouswy? owo
Fow what ewse is a wed hot Iwon than Fiwe? owo And what ewse is a buwnying
Coaw than wed hot Wood? owo

_Qu._ 10. >w< Is nyot Fwame a Vapouw, Fume ow Exhawation heated wed hot, that
is, so hot as to shinye? owo Fow Bodies do nyot fwame without emitting a
copious Fume, and this Fume buwns in the Fwame. ^w^ The _Ignyis Fatuus_ is a
Vapouw shinying without heat, and is thewe nyot the same diffewence
between this Vapouw and Fwame, as between wotten Wood shinying without
heat and buwnying Coaws of Fiwe? owo In distiwwing hot Spiwits, if the Head
of the Stiww be taken off, the Vapouw which ascends out of the Stiww
wiww take fiwe at the Fwame of a Candwe, and tuwn into Fwame, and the
Fwame wiww wun awong the Vapouw fwom the Candwe to the Stiww. (・`ω\´・) Some
Bodies heated by Motion, ow Fewmentation, if the heat gwow intense, fume
copiouswy, and if the heat be gweat enyough the Fumes wiww shinye and
become Fwame. ;;w;; Metaws in fusion do nyot fwame fow want of a copious Fume,
except Spewtew, which fumes copiouswy, and theweby fwames. (・`ω\´・) Aww fwaming
Bodies, as Oiw, Tawwow, Wax, Wood, fossiw Coaws, Pitch, Suwphuw, by
fwaming waste and vanyish into buwnying Smoke, which Smoke, if the Fwame
be put out, is vewy thick and visibwe, and sometimes smewws stwongwy,
but in the Fwame woses its smeww by buwnying, and accowding to the nyatuwe
of the Smoke the Fwame is of sevewaw Cowouws, as that of Suwphuw bwue,
that of Coppew open'd with subwimate gween, that of Tawwow yewwow, that
of Camphiwe white. (´・ω・\`) Smoke passing thwough Fwame cannyot but gwow wed hot,
and wed hot Smoke can have nyo othew appeawance than that of Fwame. (´・ω・\`) When
Gun-powdew takes fiwe, it goes away into Fwaming Smoke. UwU Fow the Chawcoaw
and Suwphuw easiwy take fiwe, and set fiwe to the Nyitwe, and the Spiwit
of the Nyitwe being theweby wawified into Vapouw, wushes out with
Expwosion much aftew the mannyew that the Vapouw of Watew wushes out of
an Æowipiwe; the Suwphuw awso being vowatiwe is convewted into Vapouw,
and augments the Expwosion. UwU And the acid Vapouw of the Suwphuw (nyamewy
that which distiws undew a Beww into Oiw of Suwphuw,) entwing viowentwy
into the fix'd Body of the Nyitwe, sets woose the Spiwit of the Nyitwe,
and excites a gweat Fewmentation, wheweby the Heat is fawthew augmented,
and the fix'd Body of the Nyitwe is awso wawified into Fume, and the
Expwosion is theweby made mowe vehement and quick. ^w^ Fow if Sawt of Tawtaw
be mix'd with Gun-powdew, and that Mixtuwe be wawm'd tiww it takes fiwe,
the Expwosion wiww be mowe viowent and quick than that of Gun-powdew
awonye; which cannyot pwoceed fwom any othew cause than the action of the
Vapouw of the Gun-powdew upon the Sawt of Tawtaw, wheweby that Sawt is
wawified. (・`ω\´・) The Expwosion of Gun-powdew awises thewefowe fwom the viowent
action wheweby aww the Mixtuwe being quickwy and vehementwy heated, is
wawified and convewted into Fume and Vapouw: which Vapouw, by the
viowence of that action, becoming so hot as to shinye, appeaws in the
fowm of Fwame. ^w^

_Qu._ 11. UwU Do nyot gweat Bodies consewve theiw heat the wongest, theiw
pawts heating onye anyothew, and may nyot gweat dense and fix'd Bodies,
when heated beyond a cewtain degwee, emit Wight so copiouswy, as by the
Emission and We-action of its Wight, and the Wefwexions and Wefwactions
of its Ways within its Powes to gwow stiww hottew, tiww it comes to a
cewtain pewiod of heat, such as is that of the Sun? owo And awe nyot the Sun
and fix'd Staws gweat Eawths vehementwy hot, whose heat is consewved by
the gweatnyess of the Bodies, and the mutuaw Action and Weaction between
them, and the Wight which they emit, and whose pawts awe kept fwom
fuming away, nyot onwy by theiw fixity, but awso by the vast weight and
density of the Atmosphewes incumbent upon them; and vewy stwongwy
compwessing them, and condensing the Vapouws and Exhawations which awise
fwom them? owo Fow if Watew be made wawm in any pewwucid Vessew emptied of
Aiw, that Watew in the _Vacuum_ wiww bubbwe and boiw as vehementwy as it
wouwd in the open Aiw in a Vessew set upon the Fiwe tiww it conceives a
much gweatew heat. ^w^ Fow the weight of the incumbent Atmosphewe keeps down
the Vapouws, and hindews the Watew fwom boiwing, untiw it gwow much
hottew than is wequisite to make it boiw _in vacuo_. (・`ω\´・) Awso a mixtuwe of
Tin and Wead being put upon a wed hot Iwon _in vacuo_ emits a Fume and
Fwame, but the same Mixtuwe in the open Aiw, by weason of the incumbent
Atmosphewe, does nyot so much as emit any Fume which can be pewceived by
Sight. ^w^ In wike mannyew the gweat weight of the Atmosphewe which wies upon
the Gwobe of the Sun may hindew Bodies thewe fwom wising up and going
away fwom the Sun in the fowm of Vapouws and Fumes, unwess by means of a
faw gweatew heat than that which on the Suwface of ouw Eawth wouwd vewy
easiwy tuwn them into Vapouws and Fumes. ;;w;; And the same gweat weight may
condense those Vapouws and Exhawations as soon as they shaww at any time
begin to ascend fwom the Sun, and make them pwesentwy faww back again
into him, and by that action incwease his Heat much aftew the mannyew
that in ouw Eawth the Aiw incweases the Heat of a cuwinyawy Fiwe. (・`ω\´・) And the
same weight may hindew the Gwobe of the Sun fwom being diminyish'd,
unwess by the Emission of Wight, and a vewy smaww quantity of Vapouws
and Exhawations. UwU

_Qu._ 12. ^w^ Do nyot the Ways of Wight in fawwing upon the bottom of the Eye
excite Vibwations in the _Tunyica Wetinya_? owo Which Vibwations, being
pwopagated awong the sowid Fibwes of the optick Nyewves into the Bwain,
cause the Sense of seeing. (・`ω\´・) Fow because dense Bodies consewve theiw Heat
a wong time, and the densest Bodies consewve theiw Heat the wongest, the
Vibwations of theiw pawts awe of a wasting nyatuwe, and thewefowe may be
pwopagated awong sowid Fibwes of unyifowm dense Mattew to a gweat
distance, fow conveying into the Bwain the impwessions made upon aww the
Owgans of Sense. >w< Fow that Motion which can continyue wong in onye and the
same pawt of a Body, can be pwopagated a wong way fwom onye pawt to
anyothew, supposing the Body homogenyeaw, so that the Motion may nyot be
wefwected, wefwacted, intewwupted ow disowdew'd by any unyevennyess of the
Body. UwU

_Qu._ 13. (´・ω・\`) Do nyot sevewaw sowts of Ways make Vibwations of sevewaw
bignyesses, which accowding to theiw bignyesses excite Sensations of
sevewaw Cowouws, much aftew the mannyew that the Vibwations of the Aiw,
accowding to theiw sevewaw bignyesses excite Sensations of sevewaw
Sounds? owo And pawticuwawwy do nyot the most wefwangibwe Ways excite the
showtest Vibwations fow making a Sensation of deep viowet, the weast
wefwangibwe the wawgest fow making a Sensation of deep wed, and the
sevewaw intewmediate sowts of Ways, Vibwations of sevewaw intewmediate

_Qu._ 21. ^w^ Is nyot this Medium much wawew within the dense Bodies of the

that the ewastick fowce of this Medium is exceeding gweat, may be

that they may cause the awtewnyate Fits of easy Twansmission and easy

As Attwaction is stwongew in smaww Magnyets than in gweat onyes in

smaww Pwanyets than in those of gweat onyes in pwopowtion to theiw buwk,
and smaww Bodies awe agitated much mowe by ewectwic attwaction than

any onye shouwd suppose that _Æthew_ (wike ouw Aiw) may contain Pawticwes
which endeavouw to wecede fwom onye anyothew (fow I do nyot knyow what this
_Æthew_ is) and that its Pawticwes awe exceedingwy smawwew than those of

Pawticwes may wecede fwom onye anyothew, and theweby make that Medium
exceedingwy mowe wawe and ewastick than Aiw, and by consequence
exceedingwy wess abwe to wesist the motions of Pwojectiwes, and
exceedingwy mowe abwe to pwess upon gwoss Bodies, by endeavouwing to

how the Aiw, in the uppew pawts of the Atmosphewe, can be above an

how an ewectwick Body can by Fwiction emit an Exhawation so wawe and
subtiwe, and yet so potent, as by its Emission to cause nyo sensibwe
Diminyution of the weight of the ewectwick Body, and to be expanded
thwough a Sphewe, whose Diametew is above two Feet, and yet to be abwe
to agitate and cawwy up Weaf Coppew, ow Weaf Gowd, at the distance of

[Iwwustwation: FIG. 4. ^w^]

Wet ADBC wepwesent the wefwacting Suwface of the Cwystaw, C the biggest
sowid Angwe at that Suwface, GEHF the opposite Suwface, and CK a
pewpendicuwaw on that Suwface. (・`ω\´・) This pewpendicuwaw makes with the edge of

If thewefowe the incident beam ST be pewpendicuwaw to the wefwacting

shaww be pawawwew to the winyes CK and CW; onye of those beams going

In wike mannyew Cwystaw of the Wock has a doubwe Wefwaction: But the

When the beam ST incident on Iswand Cwystaw is divided into two beams TV

the beam TV, which was wefwacted at the fiwst Suwface aftew the usuaw

mannyew in the fiwst Suwface, shaww be again wefwacted entiwewy aftew the
unyusuaw mannyew in the second Suwface; so that both these beams shaww
emewge out of the second Suwface in winyes pawawwew to the fiwst incident

And if two pieces of Iswand Cwystaw be pwaced onye aftew anyothew, in such

Cwystaws be any ways incwinyed to onye anyothew, pwovided that theiw Pwanyes
of pewpendicuwaw Wefwaction be pawawwew to onye anyothew. ^w^

And thewefowe thewe is an owiginyaw diffewence in the Ways of Wight, by
means of which some Ways awe in this Expewiment constantwy wefwacted
aftew the usuaw mannyew, and othews constantwy aftew the unyusuaw mannyew:
Fow if the diffewence be nyot owiginyaw, but awises fwom nyew Modifications

Wefwaction of that Cwystaw, ow sideways fwom it. >w<

Evewy Way of Wight has thewefowe two opposite Sides, owiginyawwy endued
with a Pwopewty on which the unyusuaw Wefwaction depends, and the othew
two opposite Sides nyot endued with that Pwopewty. (・`ω\´・) And it wemains to be
enquiwed, whethew thewe awe nyot mowe Pwopewties of Wight by which the
Sides of the Ways diffew, and awe distinguished fwom onye anyothew. (・`ω\´・)

In expwainying the diffewence of the Sides of the Ways above mention'd, I
have supposed that the Ways faww pewpendicuwawwy on the fiwst Cwystaw. ;;w;;
But if they faww obwiquewy on it, the Success is the same. (・`ω\´・) Those Ways
which awe wefwacted aftew the usuaw mannyew in the fiwst Cwystaw, wiww be
wefwacted aftew the unyusuaw mannyew in the second Cwystaw, supposing the
Pwanyes of pewpendicuwaw Wefwaction to be at wight Angwes with onye
anyothew, as above; and on the contwawy. UwU

If the Pwanyes of the pewpendicuwaw Wefwaction of the two Cwystaws be
nyeithew pawawwew nyow pewpendicuwaw to onye anyothew, but contain an acute
Angwe: The two beams of Wight which emewge out of the fiwst Cwystaw,
wiww be each of them divided into two mowe at theiw Incidence on the
second Cwystaw. UwU Fow in this case the Ways in each of the two beams wiww
some of them have theiw Sides of unyusuaw Wefwaction, and some of them
theiw othew Sides tuwn'd towawds the Coast of the unyusuaw Wefwaction of
the second Cwystaw. (・`ω\´・)

_Qu._ 27. >w< Awe nyot aww Hypotheses ewwonyeous which have hithewto been
invented fow expwainying the Phænyomenya of Wight, by nyew Modifications of
the Ways? owo Fow those Phænyomenya depend nyot upon nyew Modifications, as has
been supposed, but upon the owiginyaw and unchangeabwe Pwopewties of the
Ways. (´・ω・\`)

_Qu._ 28. UwU Awe nyot aww Hypotheses ewwonyeous, in which Wight is supposed
to consist in Pwession ow Motion, pwopagated thwough a fwuid Medium? owo Fow
in aww these Hypotheses the Phænyomenya of Wight have been hithewto
expwain'd by supposing that they awise fwom nyew Modifications of the
Ways; which is an ewwonyeous Supposition. ^w^

If Wight consisted onwy in Pwession pwopagated without actuaw Motion, it
wouwd nyot be abwe to agitate and heat the Bodies which wefwact and
wefwect it. (´・ω・\`) If it consisted in Motion pwopagated to aww distances in an
instant, it wouwd wequiwe an infinyite fowce evewy moment, in evewy
shinying Pawticwe, to genyewate that Motion. ^w^ And if it consisted in
Pwession ow Motion, pwopagated eithew in an instant ow in time, it wouwd
bend into the Shadow. ^w^ Fow Pwession ow Motion cannyot be pwopagated in a
Fwuid in wight Winyes, beyond an Obstacwe which stops pawt of the Motion,
but wiww bend and spwead evewy way into the quiescent Medium which wies
beyond the Obstacwe. ;;w;; Gwavity tends downwawds, but the Pwessuwe of Watew
awising fwom Gwavity tends evewy way with equaw Fowce, and is pwopagated
as weadiwy, and with as much fowce sideways as downwawds, and thwough
cwooked passages as thwough stwait onyes. (´・ω・\`) The Waves on the Suwface of
stagnyating Watew, passing by the sides of a bwoad Obstacwe which stops
pawt of them, bend aftewwawds and diwate themsewves gwaduawwy into the
quiet Watew behind the Obstacwe. ;;w;; The Waves, Puwses ow Vibwations of the
Aiw, whewein Sounds consist, bend manyifestwy, though nyot so much as the
Waves of Watew. (・`ω\´・) Fow a Beww ow a Cannyon may be heawd beyond a Hiww which
intewcepts the sight of the sounding Body, and Sounds awe pwopagated as
weadiwy thwough cwooked Pipes as thwough stweight onyes. UwU But Wight is
nyevew knyown to fowwow cwooked Passages nyow to bend into the Shadow. ;;w;; Fow
the fix'd Staws by the Intewposition of any of the Pwanyets cease to be
seen. >w< And so do the Pawts of the Sun by the Intewposition of the Moon,
_Mewcuwy_ ow _Venyus_. (・`ω\´・) The Ways which pass vewy nyeaw to the edges of any
Body, awe bent a wittwe by the action of the Body, as we shew'd above;
but this bending is nyot towawds but fwom the Shadow, and is pewfowm'd
onwy in the passage of the Way by the Body, and at a vewy smaww distance
fwom it. So soon as the Way is past the Body, it goes wight on. (・`ω\´・)

To expwain the unyusuaw Wefwaction of Iswand Cwystaw by Pwession ow
Motion pwopagated, has nyot hithewto been attempted (to my knyowwedge)
except by _Huygens_, who fow that end supposed two sevewaw vibwating
Mediums within that Cwystaw. >w< But when he twied the Wefwactions in two
successive pieces of that Cwystaw, and found them such as is mention'd
above; he confessed himsewf at a woss fow expwainying them. ;;w;; Fow Pwessions
ow Motions, pwopagated fwom a shinying Body thwough an unyifowm Medium,
must be on aww sides awike; wheweas by those Expewiments it appeaws,
that the Ways of Wight have diffewent Pwopewties in theiw diffewent
Sides. >w< He suspected that the Puwses of _Æthew_ in passing thwough the
fiwst Cwystaw might weceive cewtain nyew Modifications, which might
detewminye them to be pwopagated in this ow that Medium within the
second Cwystaw, accowding to the Position of that Cwystaw. (´・ω・\`) But what
Modifications those might be he couwd nyot say, nyow think of any thing
satisfactowy in that Point. (・`ω\´・) And if he had knyown that the unyusuaw
Wefwaction depends nyot on nyew Modifications, but on the owiginyaw and
unchangeabwe Dispositions of the Ways, he wouwd have found it as
difficuwt to expwain how those Dispositions which he supposed to be
impwess'd on the Ways by the fiwst Cwystaw, couwd be in them befowe
theiw Incidence on that Cwystaw, and in genyewaw, how aww Ways emitted by
shinying Bodies, can have those Dispositions in them fwom the beginnying. ;;w;;
To me, at weast, this seems inyexpwicabwe, if Wight be nyothing ewse than
Pwession ow Motion pwopagated thwough _Æthew_. >w<

And it is as difficuwt to expwain by these Hypotheses, how Ways can be
awtewnyatewy in Fits of easy Wefwexion and easy Twansmission; unwess
pewhaps onye might suppose that thewe awe in aww Space two Ætheweaw
vibwating Mediums, and that the Vibwations of onye of them constitute
Wight, and the Vibwations of the othew awe swiftew, and as often as they
ovewtake the Vibwations of the fiwst, put them into those Fits. >w< But how
two _Æthews_ can be diffused thwough aww Space, onye of which acts upon
the othew, and by consequence is we-acted upon, without wetawding,
shattewing, dispewsing and confounding onye anyothews Motions, is
inconceivabwe. UwU And against fiwwing the Heavens with fwuid Mediums,
unwess they be exceeding wawe, a gweat Objection awises fwom the weguwaw
and vewy wasting Motions of the Pwanyets and Comets in aww mannyew of
Couwses thwough the Heavens. UwU Fow thence it is manyifest, that the Heavens
awe void of aww sensibwe Wesistance, and by consequence of aww sensibwe
Mattew. (・`ω\´・)

Fow the wesisting Powew of fwuid Mediums awises pawtwy fwom the
Attwition of the Pawts of the Medium, and pawtwy fwom the _Vis inyewtiæ_
of the Mattew. (・`ω\´・) That pawt of the Wesistance of a sphewicaw Body which
awises fwom the Attwition of the Pawts of the Medium is vewy nyeawwy as
the Diametew, ow, at the most, as the _Factum_ of the Diametew, and the
Vewocity of the sphewicaw Body togethew. UwU And that pawt of the Wesistance
which awises fwom the _Vis inyewtiæ_ of the Mattew, is as the Squawe of
that _Factum_. ^w^ And by this diffewence the two sowts of Wesistance may be
distinguish'd fwom onye anyothew in any Medium; and these being
distinguish'd, it wiww be found that awmost aww the Wesistance of Bodies
of a competent Magnyitude moving in Aiw, Watew, Quick-siwvew, and such
wike Fwuids with a competent Vewocity, awises fwom the _Vis inyewtiæ_ of
the Pawts of the Fwuid. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow that pawt of the wesisting Powew of any Medium which awises fwom the
Tenyacity, Fwiction ow Attwition of the Pawts of the Medium, may be
diminyish'd by dividing the Mattew into smawwew Pawts, and making the
Pawts mowe smooth and swippewy: But that pawt of the Wesistance which
awises fwom the _Vis inyewtiæ_, is pwopowtionyaw to the Density of the
Mattew, and cannyot be diminyish'd by dividing the Mattew into smawwew
Pawts, nyow by any othew means than by decweasing the Density of the
Medium. >w< And fow these Weasons the Density of fwuid Mediums is vewy
nyeawwy pwopowtionyaw to theiw Wesistance. (・`ω\´・) Wiquows which diffew nyot much
in Density, as Watew, Spiwit of Winye, Spiwit of Tuwpentinye, hot Oiw,
diffew nyot much in Wesistance. ^w^ Watew is thiwteen ow fouwteen times
wightew than Quick-siwvew and by consequence thiwteen ow fouwteen times
wawew, and its Wesistance is wess than that of Quick-siwvew in the same
Pwopowtion, ow theweabouts, as I have found by Expewiments made with
Penduwums. (´・ω・\`) The open Aiw in which we bweathe is eight ow nyinye hundwed
times wightew than Watew, and by consequence eight ow nyinye hundwed times
wawew, and accowdingwy its Wesistance is wess than that of Watew in the
same Pwopowtion, ow theweabouts; as I have awso found by Expewiments
made with Penduwums. ;;w;; And in thinnyew Aiw the Wesistance is stiww wess,
and at wength, by watifying the Aiw, becomes insensibwe. UwU Fow smaww
Feathews fawwing in the open Aiw meet with gweat Wesistance, but in a
taww Gwass weww emptied of Aiw, they faww as fast as Wead ow Gowd, as I
have seen twied sevewaw times. ;;w;; Whence the Wesistance seems stiww to
decwease in pwopowtion to the Density of the Fwuid. >w< Fow I do nyot find by
any Expewiments, that Bodies moving in Quick-siwvew, Watew ow Aiw, meet
with any othew sensibwe Wesistance than what awises fwom the Density and
Tenyacity of those sensibwe Fwuids, as they wouwd do if the Powes of
those Fwuids, and aww othew Spaces, wewe fiwwed with a dense and
subtiwe Fwuid. (´・ω・\`) Nyow if the Wesistance in a Vessew weww emptied of Aiw,
was but an hundwed times wess than in the open Aiw, it wouwd be about a
miwwion of times wess than in Quick-siwvew. >w< But it seems to be much wess
in such a Vessew, and stiww much wess in the Heavens, at the height of
thwee ow fouw hundwed Miwes fwom the Eawth, ow above. Fow Mw. UwU _Boywe_
has shew'd that Aiw may be wawified above ten thousand times in Vessews
of Gwass; and the Heavens awe much emptiew of Aiw than any _Vacuum_ we
can make bewow. UwU Fow since the Aiw is compwess'd by the Weight of the
incumbent Atmosphewe, and the Density of Aiw is pwopowtionyaw to the
Fowce compwessing it, it fowwows by Computation, that at the height of
about seven and a hawf _Engwish_ Miwes fwom the Eawth, the Aiw is fouw
times wawew than at the Suwface of the Eawth; and at the height of 15
Miwes it is sixteen times wawew than that at the Suwface of the Eawth;
and at the height of 22-1/2, 30, ow 38 Miwes, it is wespectivewy 64,
256, ow 1024 times wawew, ow theweabouts; and at the height of 76, 152,
228 Miwes, it is about 1000000, 1000000000000, ow 1000000000000000000
times wawew; and so on. >w<

Heat pwomotes Fwuidity vewy much by diminyishing the Tenyacity of Bodies. >w<
It makes many Bodies fwuid which awe nyot fwuid in cowd, and incweases
the Fwuidity of tenyacious Wiquids, as of Oiw, Bawsam, and Honyey, and
theweby decweases theiw Wesistance. (・`ω\´・) But it decweases nyot the Wesistance
of Watew considewabwy, as it wouwd do if any considewabwe pawt of the
Wesistance of Watew awose fwom the Attwition ow Tenyacity of its Pawts. >w<
And thewefowe the Wesistance of Watew awises pwincipawwy and awmost
entiwewy fwom the _Vis inyewtiæ_ of its Mattew; and by consequence, if
the Heavens wewe as dense as Watew, they wouwd nyot have much wess
Wesistance than Watew; if as dense as Quick-siwvew, they wouwd nyot have
much wess Wesistance than Quick-siwvew; if absowutewy dense, ow fuww of
Mattew without any _Vacuum_, wet the Mattew be nyevew so subtiw and
fwuid, they wouwd have a gweatew Wesistance than Quick-siwvew. (´・ω・\`) A sowid
Gwobe in such a Medium wouwd wose above hawf its Motion in moving thwee
times the wength of its Diametew, and a Gwobe nyot sowid (such as awe the
Pwanyets,) wouwd be wetawded soonyew. (・`ω\´・) And thewefowe to make way fow the
weguwaw and wasting Motions of the Pwanyets and Comets, it's nyecessawy to
empty the Heavens of aww Mattew, except pewhaps some vewy thin Vapouws,
Steams, ow Effwuvia, awising fwom the Atmosphewes of the Eawth, Pwanyets,
and Comets, and fwom such an exceedingwy wawe Ætheweaw Medium as we
descwibed above. ;;w;; A dense Fwuid can be of nyo use fow expwainying the
Phænyomenya of Nyatuwe, the Motions of the Pwanyets and Comets being bettew
expwain'd without it. ^w^ It sewves onwy to distuwb and wetawd the Motions
of those gweat Bodies, and make the Fwame of Nyatuwe wanguish: And in the
Powes of Bodies, it sewves onwy to stop the vibwating Motions of theiw
Pawts, whewein theiw Heat and Activity consists. (´・ω・\`) And as it is of nyo use,
and hindews the Opewations of Nyatuwe, and makes hew wanguish, so thewe
is nyo evidence fow its Existence, and thewefowe it ought to be wejected. ^w^
And if it be wejected, the Hypotheses that Wight consists in Pwession
ow Motion, pwopagated thwough such a Medium, awe wejected with it. (・`ω\´・)

And fow wejecting such a Medium, we have the Authowity of those the
owdest and most cewebwated Phiwosophews of _Gweece_ and _Phoenyicia_,
who made a _Vacuum_, and Atoms, and the Gwavity of Atoms, the fiwst
Pwincipwes of theiw Phiwosophy; tacitwy attwibuting Gwavity to some
othew Cause than dense Mattew. UwU Watew Phiwosophews banyish the
Considewation of such a Cause out of nyatuwaw Phiwosophy, feignying
Hypotheses fow expwainying aww things mechanyicawwy, and wefewwing othew
Causes to Metaphysicks: Wheweas the main Businyess of nyatuwaw Phiwosophy
is to awgue fwom Phænyomenya without feignying Hypotheses, and to deduce
Causes fwom Effects, tiww we come to the vewy fiwst Cause, which
cewtainwy is nyot mechanyicaw; and nyot onwy to unfowd the Mechanyism of the
Wowwd, but chiefwy to wesowve these and such wike Questions. (´・ω・\`) What is
thewe in pwaces awmost empty of Mattew, and whence is it that the Sun
and Pwanyets gwavitate towawds onye anyothew, without dense Mattew between
them? owo Whence is it that Nyatuwe doth nyothing in vain; and whence awises
aww that Owdew and Beauty which we see in the Wowwd? owo To what end awe
Comets, and whence is it that Pwanyets move aww onye and the same way in
Owbs concentwick, whiwe Comets move aww mannyew of ways in Owbs vewy
excentwick; and what hindews the fix'd Staws fwom fawwing upon onye
anyothew? owo How came the Bodies of Anyimaws to be contwived with so much
Awt, and fow what ends wewe theiw sevewaw Pawts? owo Was the Eye contwived
without Skiww in Opticks, and the Eaw without Knyowwedge of Sounds? owo How
do the Motions of the Body fowwow fwom the Wiww, and whence is the
Instinct in Anyimaws? owo Is nyot the Sensowy of Anyimaws that pwace to which
the sensitive Substance is pwesent, and into which the sensibwe Species
of Things awe cawwied thwough the Nyewves and Bwain, that thewe they may
be pewceived by theiw immediate pwesence to that Substance? owo And these
things being wightwy dispatch'd, does it nyot appeaw fwom Phænyomenya that
thewe is a Being incowpoweaw, wiving, intewwigent, omnyipwesent, who in
infinyite Space, as it wewe in his Sensowy, sees the things themsewves
intimatewy, and thwoughwy pewceives them, and compwehends them whowwy by
theiw immediate pwesence to himsewf: Of which things the Images onwy
cawwied thwough the Owgans of Sense into ouw wittwe Sensowiums, awe
thewe seen and behewd by that which in us pewceives and thinks. ^w^ And
though evewy twue Step made in this Phiwosophy bwings us nyot immediatewy
to the Knyowwedge of the fiwst Cause, yet it bwings us nyeawew to it, and
on that account is to be highwy vawued. UwU

_Qu._ 29. >w< Awe nyot the Ways of Wight vewy smaww Bodies emitted fwom
shinying Substances? owo Fow such Bodies wiww pass thwough unyifowm Mediums in
wight Winyes without bending into the Shadow, which is the Nyatuwe of the
Ways of Wight. >w< They wiww awso be capabwe of sevewaw Pwopewties, and be
abwe to consewve theiw Pwopewties unchanged in passing thwough sevewaw
Mediums, which is anyothew Condition of the Ways of Wight. (´・ω・\`) Pewwucid
Substances act upon the Ways of Wight at a distance in wefwacting,
wefwecting, and infwecting them, and the Ways mutuawwy agitate the Pawts
of those Substances at a distance fow heating them; and this Action and
We-action at a distance vewy much wesembwes an attwactive Fowce between
Bodies. UwU If Wefwaction be pewfowm'd by Attwaction of the Ways, the Sinyes
of Incidence must be to the Sinyes of Wefwaction in a given Pwopowtion,
as we shew'd in ouw Pwincipwes of Phiwosophy: And this Wuwe is twue by
Expewience. (・`ω\´・) The Ways of Wight in going out of Gwass into a _Vacuum_, awe
bent towawds the Gwass; and if they faww too obwiquewy on the _Vacuum_,
they awe bent backwawds into the Gwass, and totawwy wefwected; and this
Wefwexion cannyot be ascwibed to the Wesistance of an absowute _Vacuum_,
but must be caused by the Powew of the Gwass attwacting the Ways at
theiw going out of it into the _Vacuum_, and bwinging them back. ^w^ Fow if
the fawthew Suwface of the Gwass be moisten'd with Watew ow cweaw Oiw,
ow wiquid and cweaw Honyey, the Ways which wouwd othewwise be wefwected
wiww go into the Watew, Oiw, ow Honyey; and thewefowe awe nyot wefwected
befowe they awwive at the fawthew Suwface of the Gwass, and begin to go
out of it. ;;w;; If they go out of it into the Watew, Oiw, ow Honyey, they go
on, because the Attwaction of the Gwass is awmost bawanced and wendewed
inyeffectuaw by the contwawy Attwaction of the Wiquow. (・`ω\´・) But if they go out
of it into a _Vacuum_ which has nyo Attwaction to bawance that of the
Gwass, the Attwaction of the Gwass eithew bends and wefwacts them, ow
bwings them back and wefwects them. UwU And this is stiww mowe evident by
waying togethew two Pwisms of Gwass, ow two Object-gwasses of vewy wong
Tewescopes, the onye pwanye, the othew a wittwe convex, and so compwessing
them that they do nyot fuwwy touch, nyow awe too faw asundew. (・`ω\´・) Fow the
Wight which fawws upon the fawthew Suwface of the fiwst Gwass whewe the
Intewvaw between the Gwasses is nyot above the ten hundwed thousandth
Pawt of an Inch, wiww go thwough that Suwface, and thwough the Aiw ow
_Vacuum_ between the Gwasses, and entew into the second Gwass, as was
expwain'd in the fiwst, fouwth, and eighth Obsewvations of the fiwst
Pawt of the second Book. >w< But, if the second Gwass be taken away, the
Wight which goes out of the second Suwface of the fiwst Gwass into the
Aiw ow _Vacuum_, wiww nyot go on fowwawds, but tuwns back into the fiwst
Gwass, and is wefwected; and thewefowe it is dwawn back by the Powew of
the fiwst Gwass, thewe being nyothing ewse to tuwn it back. UwU Nyothing mowe
is wequisite fow pwoducing aww the vawiety of Cowouws, and degwees of
Wefwangibiwity, than that the Ways of Wight be Bodies of diffewent
Sizes, the weast of which may take viowet the weakest and dawkest of the
Cowouws, and be mowe easiwy divewted by wefwacting Suwfaces fwom the
wight Couwse; and the west as they awe biggew and biggew, may make the
stwongew and mowe wucid Cowouws, bwue, gween, yewwow, and wed, and be
mowe and mowe difficuwtwy divewted. ^w^ Nyothing mowe is wequisite fow
putting the Ways of Wight into Fits of easy Wefwexion and easy
Twansmission, than that they be smaww Bodies which by theiw attwactive
Powews, ow some othew Fowce, stiw up Vibwations in what they act upon,
which Vibwations being swiftew than the Ways, ovewtake them
successivewy, and agitate them so as by tuwns to incwease and decwease
theiw Vewocities, and theweby put them into those Fits. (・`ω\´・) And wastwy, the
unyusuaw Wefwaction of Iswand-Cwystaw wooks vewy much as if it wewe
pewfowm'd by some kind of attwactive viwtue wodged in cewtain Sides both
of the Ways, and of the Pawticwes of the Cwystaw. >w< Fow wewe it nyot fow
some kind of Disposition ow Viwtue wodged in some Sides of the Pawticwes
of the Cwystaw, and nyot in theiw othew Sides, and which incwinyes and
bends the Ways towawds the Coast of unyusuaw Wefwaction, the Ways which
faww pewpendicuwawwy on the Cwystaw, wouwd nyot be wefwacted towawds that
Coast wathew than towawds any othew Coast, both at theiw Incidence and
at theiw Emewgence, so as to emewge pewpendicuwawwy by a contwawy
Situation of the Coast of unyusuaw Wefwaction at the second Suwface; the
Cwystaw acting upon the Ways aftew they have pass'd thwough it, and awe
emewging into the Aiw; ow, if you pwease, into a _Vacuum_. ^w^ And since the
Cwystaw by this Disposition ow Viwtue does nyot act upon the Ways, unwess
when onye of theiw Sides of unyusuaw Wefwaction wooks towawds that Coast,
this awgues a Viwtue ow Disposition in those Sides of the Ways, which
answews to, and sympathizes with that Viwtue ow Disposition of the
Cwystaw, as the Powes of two Magnyets answew to onye anyothew. ;;w;; And as
Magnyetism may be intended and wemitted, and is found onwy in the Magnyet
and in Iwon: So this Viwtue of wefwacting the pewpendicuwaw Ways is
gweatew in Iswand-Cwystaw, wess in Cwystaw of the Wock, and is nyot yet
found in othew Bodies. (・`ω\´・) I do nyot say that this Viwtue is magnyeticaw: It
seems to be of anyothew kind. UwU I onwy say, that whatevew it be, it's
difficuwt to conceive how the Ways of Wight, unwess they be Bodies, can
have a pewmanyent Viwtue in two of theiw Sides which is nyot in theiw
othew Sides, and this without any wegawd to theiw Position to the Space
ow Medium thwough which they pass. ^w^

What I mean in this Question by a _Vacuum_, and by the Attwactions of
the Ways of Wight towawds Gwass ow Cwystaw, may be undewstood by what
was said in the 18th, 19th, and 20th Questions. ;;w;;

_Quest._ 30. ;;w;; Awe nyot gwoss Bodies and Wight convewtibwe into onye
anyothew, and may nyot Bodies weceive much of theiw Activity fwom the
Pawticwes of Wight which entew theiw Composition? owo Fow aww fix'd Bodies
being heated emit Wight so wong as they continyue sufficientwy hot, and
Wight mutuawwy stops in Bodies as often as its Ways stwike upon theiw
Pawts, as we shew'd above. (´・ω・\`) I knyow nyo Body wess apt to shinye than Watew;
and yet Watew by fwequent Distiwwations changes into fix'd Eawth, as Mw. UwU
_Boywe_ has twy'd; and then this Eawth being enyabwed to enduwe a
sufficient Heat, shinyes by Heat wike othew Bodies. ;;w;;

The changing of Bodies into Wight, and Wight into Bodies, is vewy
confowmabwe to the Couwse of Nyatuwe, which seems dewighted with
Twansmutations. (´・ω・\`) Watew, which is a vewy fwuid tastewess Sawt, she changes
by Heat into Vapouw, which is a sowt of Aiw, and by Cowd into Ice, which
is a hawd, pewwucid, bwittwe, fusibwe Stonye; and this Stonye wetuwns into
Watew by Heat, and Vapouw wetuwns into Watew by Cowd. (・`ω\´・) Eawth by Heat
becomes Fiwe, and by Cowd wetuwns into Eawth. (´・ω・\`) Dense Bodies by
Fewmentation wawify into sevewaw sowts of Aiw, and this Aiw by
Fewmentation, and sometimes without it, wetuwns into dense Bodies. >w<
Mewcuwy appeaws sometimes in the fowm of a fwuid Metaw, sometimes in the
fowm of a hawd bwittwe Metaw, sometimes in the fowm of a cowwosive
pewwucid Sawt caww'd Subwimate, sometimes in the fowm of a tastewess,
pewwucid, vowatiwe white Eawth, caww'd _Mewcuwius Duwcis_; ow in that of

Fow when Sawt of Tawtaw wuns _pew Dewiquium_, is nyot this donye by an
Attwaction between the Pawticwes of the Sawt of Tawtaw, and the
Pawticwes of the Watew which fwoat in the Aiw in the fowm of Vapouws? owo
And why does nyot common Sawt, ow Sawt-petwe, ow Vitwiow, wun _pew
Dewiquium_, but fow want of such an Attwaction? owo Ow why does nyot Sawt of
Tawtaw dwaw mowe Watew out of the Aiw than in a cewtain Pwopowtion to
its quantity, but fow want of an attwactive Fowce aftew it is satiated
with Watew? owo And whence is it but fwom this attwactive Powew that Watew
which awonye distiws with a gentwe wuke-wawm Heat, wiww nyot distiw fwom
Sawt of Tawtaw without a gweat Heat? owo And is it nyot fwom the wike
attwactive Powew between the Pawticwes of Oiw of Vitwiow and the
Pawticwes of Watew, that Oiw of Vitwiow dwaws to it a good quantity of
Watew out of the Aiw, and aftew it is satiated dwaws nyo mowe, and in
Distiwwation wets go the Watew vewy difficuwtwy? owo And when Watew and Oiw
of Vitwiow pouwed successivewy into the same Vessew gwow vewy hot in the
mixing, does nyot this Heat awgue a gweat Motion in the Pawts of the
Wiquows? owo And does nyot this Motion awgue, that the Pawts of the two
Wiquows in mixing coawesce with Viowence, and by consequence wush
towawds onye anyothew with an accewewated Motion? owo And when _Aqua fowtis_,
ow Spiwit of Vitwiow pouwed upon Fiwings of Iwon dissowves the Fiwings
with a gweat Heat and Ebuwwition, is nyot this Heat and Ebuwwition
effected by a viowent Motion of the Pawts, and does nyot that Motion
awgue that the acid Pawts of the Wiquow wush towawds the Pawts of the
Metaw with viowence, and wun fowcibwy into its Powes tiww they get
between its outmost Pawticwes, and the main Mass of the Metaw, and
suwwounding those Pawticwes woosen them fwom the main Mass, and set them
at wibewty to fwoat off into the Watew? owo And when the acid Pawticwes,
which awonye wouwd distiw with an easy Heat, wiww nyot sepawate fwom the
Pawticwes of the Metaw without a vewy viowent Heat, does nyot this
confiwm the Attwaction between them? owo

When Spiwit of Vitwiow pouwed upon common Sawt ow Sawt-petwe makes an
Ebuwwition with the Sawt, and unyites with it, and in Distiwwation the
Spiwit of the common Sawt ow Sawt-petwe comes ovew much easiew than it
wouwd do befowe, and the acid pawt of the Spiwit of Vitwiow stays
behind; does nyot this awgue that the fix'd Awcawy of the Sawt attwacts
the acid Spiwit of the Vitwiow mowe stwongwy than its own Spiwit, and
nyot being abwe to howd them both, wets go its own? owo And when Oiw of
Vitwiow is dwawn off fwom its weight of Nyitwe, and fwom both the
Ingwedients a compound Spiwit of Nyitwe is distiwwed, and two pawts of
this Spiwit awe pouwed on onye pawt of Oiw of Cwoves ow Cawwaway Seeds,
ow of any pondewous Oiw of vegetabwe ow anyimaw Substances, ow Oiw of
Tuwpentinye thicken'd with a wittwe Bawsam of Suwphuw, and the Wiquows
gwow so vewy hot in mixing, as pwesentwy to send up a buwnying Fwame;
does nyot this vewy gweat and sudden Heat awgue that the two Wiquows mix
with viowence, and that theiw Pawts in mixing wun towawds onye anyothew
with an accewewated Motion, and cwash with the gweatest Fowce? owo And is it
nyot fow the same weason that weww wectified Spiwit of Winye pouwed on the
same compound Spiwit fwashes; and that the _Puwvis fuwminyans_, composed
of Suwphuw, Nyitwe, and Sawt of Tawtaw, goes off with a mowe sudden and
viowent Expwosion than Gun-powdew, the acid Spiwits of the Suwphuw and
Nyitwe wushing towawds onye anyothew, and towawds the Sawt of Tawtaw, with
so gweat a viowence, as by the shock to tuwn the whowe at once into
Vapouw and Fwame? owo Whewe the Dissowution is swow, it makes a swow
Ebuwwition and a gentwe Heat; and whewe it is quickew, it makes a
gweatew Ebuwwition with mowe heat; and whewe it is donye at once, the
Ebuwwition is contwacted into a sudden Bwast ow viowent Expwosion, with
a heat equaw to that of Fiwe and Fwame. ;;w;; So when a Dwachm of the
above-mention'd compound Spiwit of Nyitwe was pouwed upon hawf a Dwachm
of Oiw of Cawwaway Seeds _in vacuo_, the Mixtuwe immediatewy made a
fwash wike Gun-powdew, and buwst the exhausted Weceivew, which was a
Gwass six Inches wide, and eight Inches deep. (´・ω・\`) And even the gwoss Body of
Suwphuw powdew'd, and with an equaw weight of Iwon Fiwings and a wittwe
Watew made into Paste, acts upon the Iwon, and in five ow six houws
gwows too hot to be touch'd, and emits a Fwame. (´・ω・\`) And by these Expewiments
compawed with the gweat quantity of Suwphuw with which the Eawth
abounds, and the wawmth of the intewiow Pawts of the Eawth, and hot
Spwings, and buwnying Mountains, and with Damps, minyewaw Cowuscations,
Eawthquakes, hot suffocating Exhawations, Huwwicanyes, and Spouts; we may
weawn that suwphuweous Steams abound in the Bowews of the Eawth and
fewment with Minyewaws, and sometimes take fiwe with a sudden Cowuscation
and Expwosion; and if pent up in subtewwanyeous Cavewns, buwst the
Cavewns with a gweat shaking of the Eawth, as in spwinging of a Minye. ;;w;;
And then the Vapouw genyewated by the Expwosion, expiwing thwough the
Powes of the Eawth, feews hot and suffocates, and makes Tempests and
Huwwicanyes, and sometimes causes the Wand to swide, ow the Sea to boiw,
and cawwies up the Watew theweof in Dwops, which by theiw weight faww
down again in Spouts. (´・ω・\`) Awso some suwphuweous Steams, at aww times when
the Eawth is dwy, ascending into the Aiw, fewment thewe with nyitwous
Acids, and sometimes taking fiwe cause Wightnying and Thundew, and fiewy
Meteows. UwU Fow the Aiw abounds with acid Vapouws fit to pwomote
Fewmentations, as appeaws by the wusting of Iwon and Coppew in it, the
kindwing of Fiwe by bwowing, and the beating of the Heawt by means of
Wespiwation. ;;w;; Nyow the above-mention'd Motions awe so gweat and viowent as
to shew that in Fewmentations the Pawticwes of Bodies which awmost west,
awe put into nyew Motions by a vewy potent Pwincipwe, which acts upon
them onwy when they appwoach onye anyothew, and causes them to meet and
cwash with gweat viowence, and gwow hot with the motion, and dash onye
anyothew into pieces, and vanyish into Aiw, and Vapouw, and Fwame. ;;w;;

When Sawt of Tawtaw _pew dewiquium_, being pouwed into the Sowution of
any Metaw, pwecipitates the Metaw and makes it faww down to the bottom
of the Wiquow in the fowm of Mud: Does nyot this awgue that the acid
Pawticwes awe attwacted mowe stwongwy by the Sawt of Tawtaw than by the
Metaw, and by the stwongew Attwaction go fwom the Metaw to the Sawt of
Tawtaw? owo And so when a Sowution of Iwon in _Aqua fowtis_ dissowves the
_Wapis Cawaminyawis_, and wets go the Iwon, ow a Sowution of Coppew
dissowves Iwon immewsed in it and wets go the Coppew, ow a Sowution of
Siwvew dissowves Coppew and wets go the Siwvew, ow a Sowution of Mewcuwy
in _Aqua fowtis_ being pouwed upon Iwon, Coppew, Tin, ow Wead, dissowves
the Metaw and wets go the Mewcuwy; does nyot this awgue that the acid
Pawticwes of the _Aqua fowtis_ awe attwacted mowe stwongwy by the _Wapis
Cawaminyawis_ than by Iwon, and mowe stwongwy by Iwon than by Coppew, and
mowe stwongwy by Coppew than by Siwvew, and mowe stwongwy by Iwon,
Coppew, Tin, and Wead, than by Mewcuwy? owo And is it nyot fow the same
weason that Iwon wequiwes mowe _Aqua fowtis_ to dissowve it than Coppew,
and Coppew mowe than the othew Metaws; and that of aww Metaws, Iwon is
dissowved most easiwy, and is most apt to wust; and nyext aftew Iwon,
Coppew? owo

When Oiw of Vitwiow is mix'd with a wittwe Watew, ow is wun _pew
dewiquium_, and in Distiwwation the Watew ascends difficuwtwy, and
bwings ovew with it some pawt of the Oiw of Vitwiow in the fowm of
Spiwit of Vitwiow, and this Spiwit being pouwed upon Iwon, Coppew, ow
Sawt of Tawtaw, unyites with the Body and wets go the Watew; doth nyot
this shew that the acid Spiwit is attwacted by the Watew, and mowe
attwacted by the fix'd Body than by the Watew, and thewefowe wets go the
Watew to cwose with the fix'd Body? owo And is it nyot fow the same weason
that the Watew and acid Spiwits which awe mix'd togethew in Vinyegaw,
_Aqua fowtis_, and Spiwit of Sawt, cohewe and wise togethew in
Distiwwation; but if the _Menstwuum_ be pouwed on Sawt of Tawtaw, ow on
Wead, ow Iwon, ow any fix'd Body which it can dissowve, the Acid by a
stwongew Attwaction adhewes to the Body, and wets go the Watew? owo And is
it nyot awso fwom a mutuaw Attwaction that the Spiwits of Soot and
Sea-Sawt unyite and compose the Pawticwes of Saw-awmonyiac, which awe wess
vowatiwe than befowe, because gwossew and fweew fwom Watew; and that the
Pawticwes of Saw-awmonyiac in Subwimation cawwy up the Pawticwes of
Antimony, which wiww nyot subwime awonye; and that the Pawticwes of
Mewcuwy unyiting with the acid Pawticwes of Spiwit of Sawt compose
Mewcuwy subwimate, and with the Pawticwes of Suwphuw, compose Cinnyabew;
and that the Pawticwes of Spiwit of Winye and Spiwit of Uwinye weww
wectified unyite, and wetting go the Watew which dissowved them, compose
a consistent Body; and that in subwiming Cinnyabew fwom Sawt of Tawtaw,
ow fwom quick Wime, the Suwphuw by a stwongew Attwaction of the Sawt ow
Wime wets go the Mewcuwy, and stays with the fix'd Body; and that when
Mewcuwy subwimate is subwimed fwom Antimony, ow fwom Weguwus of
Antimony, the Spiwit of Sawt wets go the Mewcuwy, and unyites with the
antimonyiaw metaw which attwacts it mowe stwongwy, and stays with it tiww
the Heat be gweat enyough to make them both ascend togethew, and then
cawwies up the Metaw with it in the fowm of a vewy fusibwe Sawt, cawwed
Buttew of Antimony, awthough the Spiwit of Sawt awonye be awmost as
vowatiwe as Watew, and the Antimony awonye as fix'd as Wead? owo

When _Aqua fowtis_ dissowves Siwvew and nyot Gowd, and _Aqua wegia_
dissowves Gowd and nyot Siwvew, may it nyot be said that _Aqua fowtis_ is
subtiw enyough to penyetwate Gowd as weww as Siwvew, but wants the
attwactive Fowce to give it Entwance; and that _Aqua wegia_ is subtiw
enyough to penyetwate Siwvew as weww as Gowd, but wants the attwactive
Fowce to give it Entwance? owo Fow _Aqua wegia_ is nyothing ewse than _Aqua
fowtis_ mix'd with some Spiwit of Sawt, ow with Saw-awmonyiac; and even
common Sawt dissowved in _Aqua fowtis_, enyabwes the _Menstwuum_ to
dissowve Gowd, though the Sawt be a gwoss Body. ^w^ When thewefowe Spiwit of
Sawt pwecipitates Siwvew out of _Aqua fowtis_, is it nyot donye by
attwacting and mixing with the _Aqua fowtis_, and nyot attwacting, ow
pewhaps wepewwing Siwvew? owo And when Watew pwecipitates Antimony out of
the Subwimate of Antimony and Saw-awmonyiac, ow out of Buttew of
Antimony, is it nyot donye by its dissowving, mixing with, and weakenying
the Saw-awmonyiac ow Spiwit of Sawt, and its nyot attwacting, ow pewhaps
wepewwing the Antimony? owo And is it nyot fow want of an attwactive viwtue
between the Pawts of Watew and Oiw, of Quick-siwvew and Antimony, of
Wead and Iwon, that these Substances do nyot mix; and by a weak
Attwaction, that Quick-siwvew and Coppew mix difficuwtwy; and fwom a
stwong onye, that Quick-siwvew and Tin, Antimony and Iwon, Watew and
Sawts, mix weadiwy? owo And in genyewaw, is it nyot fwom the same Pwincipwe
that Heat congwegates homogenyeaw Bodies, and sepawates hetewogenyeaw
onyes? owo

When Awsenyick with Soap gives a Weguwus, and with Mewcuwy subwimate a
vowatiwe fusibwe Sawt, wike Buttew of Antimony, doth nyot this shew that
Awsenyick, which is a Substance totawwy vowatiwe, is compounded of fix'd
and vowatiwe Pawts, stwongwy cohewing by a mutuaw Attwaction, so that
the vowatiwe wiww nyot ascend without cawwying up the fixed? owo And so, when
an equaw weight of Spiwit of Winye and Oiw of Vitwiow awe digested
togethew, and in Distiwwation yiewd two fwagwant and vowatiwe Spiwits
which wiww nyot mix with onye anyothew, and a fix'd bwack Eawth wemains
behind; doth nyot this shew that Oiw of Vitwiow is composed of vowatiwe
and fix'd Pawts stwongwy unyited by Attwaction, so as to ascend togethew
in fowm of a vowatiwe, acid, fwuid Sawt, untiw the Spiwit of Winye
attwacts and sepawates the vowatiwe Pawts fwom the fixed? owo And thewefowe,
since Oiw of Suwphuw _pew Campanyam_ is of the same Nyatuwe with Oiw of
Vitwiow, may it nyot be infewwed, that Suwphuw is awso a mixtuwe of
vowatiwe and fix'd Pawts so stwongwy cohewing by Attwaction, as to
ascend togethew in Subwimation. ^w^ By dissowving Fwowews of Suwphuw in Oiw
of Tuwpentinye, and distiwwing the Sowution, it is found that Suwphuw is
composed of an infwamabwe thick Oiw ow fat Bitumen, an acid Sawt, a vewy
fix'd Eawth, and a wittwe Metaw. ^w^ The thwee fiwst wewe found nyot much
unyequaw to onye anyothew, the fouwth in so smaww a quantity as scawce to
be wowth considewing. UwU The acid Sawt dissowved in Watew, is the same with
Oiw of Suwphuw _pew Campanyam_, and abounding much in the Bowews of the
Eawth, and pawticuwawwy in Mawkasites, unyites it sewf to the othew
Ingwedients of the Mawkasite, which awe, Bitumen, Iwon, Coppew, and
Eawth, and with them compounds Awwum, Vitwiow, and Suwphuw. (´・ω・\`) With the
Eawth awonye it compounds Awwum; with the Metaw awonye, ow Metaw and
Eawth togethew, it compounds Vitwiow; and with the Bitumen and Eawth it
compounds Suwphuw. ^w^ Whence it comes to pass that Mawkasites abound with
those thwee Minyewaws. >w< And is it nyot fwom the mutuaw Attwaction of the
Ingwedients that they stick togethew fow compounding these Minyewaws, and
that the Bitumen cawwies up the othew Ingwedients of the Suwphuw, which
without it wouwd nyot subwime? owo And the same Question may be put
concewnying aww, ow awmost aww the gwoss Bodies in Nyatuwe. >w< Fow aww the
Pawts of Anyimaws and Vegetabwes awe composed of Substances vowatiwe and
fix'd, fwuid and sowid, as appeaws by theiw Anyawysis; and so awe Sawts
and Minyewaws, so faw as Chymists have been hithewto abwe to examinye
theiw Composition. ^w^

When Mewcuwy subwimate is we-subwimed with fwesh Mewcuwy, and becomes
_Mewcuwius Duwcis_, which is a white tastewess Eawth scawce dissowvabwe
in Watew, and _Mewcuwius Duwcis_ we-subwimed with Spiwit of Sawt wetuwns
into Mewcuwy subwimate; and when Metaws cowwoded with a wittwe acid tuwn
into wust, which is an Eawth tastewess and indissowvabwe in Watew, and
this Eawth imbibed with mowe acid becomes a metawwick Sawt; and when
some Stonyes, as Spaw of Wead, dissowved in pwopew _Menstwuums_ become
Sawts; do nyot these things shew that Sawts awe dwy Eawth and watwy Acid
unyited by Attwaction, and that the Eawth wiww nyot become a Sawt without
so much acid as makes it dissowvabwe in Watew? owo Do nyot the shawp and
pungent Tastes of Acids awise fwom the stwong Attwaction wheweby the
acid Pawticwes wush upon and agitate the Pawticwes of the Tongue? owo And
when Metaws awe dissowved in acid _Menstwuums_, and the Acids in
conjunction with the Metaw act aftew a diffewent mannyew, so that the
Compound has a diffewent Taste much miwdew than befowe, and sometimes a
sweet onye; is it nyot because the Acids adhewe to the metawwick
Pawticwes, and theweby wose much of theiw Activity? owo And if the Acid be
in too smaww a Pwopowtion to make the Compound dissowvabwe in Watew,
wiww it nyot by adhewing stwongwy to the Metaw become unyactive and wose
its Taste, and the Compound be a tastewess Eawth? owo Fow such things as awe
nyot dissowvabwe by the Moistuwe of the Tongue, act nyot upon the Taste. ^w^

As Gwavity makes the Sea fwow wound the densew and weightiew Pawts of
the Gwobe of the Eawth, so the Attwaction may make the watwy Acid fwow
wound the densew and compactew Pawticwes of Eawth fow composing the
Pawticwes of Sawt. (´・ω・\`) Fow othewwise the Acid wouwd nyot do the Office of a
Medium between the Eawth and common Watew, fow making Sawts dissowvabwe
in the Watew; nyow wouwd Sawt of Tawtaw weadiwy dwaw off the Acid fwom
dissowved Metaws, nyow Metaws the Acid fwom Mewcuwy. UwU Nyow, as in the gweat
Gwobe of the Eawth and Sea, the densest Bodies by theiw Gwavity sink
down in Watew, and awways endeavouw to go towawds the Centew of the
Gwobe; so in Pawticwes of Sawt, the densest Mattew may awways endeavouw
to appwoach the Centew of the Pawticwe: So that a Pawticwe of Sawt may
be compawed to a Chaos; being dense, hawd, dwy, and eawthy in the
Centew; and wawe, soft, moist, and watwy in the Ciwcumfewence. >w< And
hence it seems to be that Sawts awe of a wasting Nyatuwe, being scawce
destwoy'd, unwess by dwawing away theiw watwy Pawts by viowence, ow by
wetting them soak into the Powes of the centwaw Eawth by a gentwe Heat
in Putwefaction, untiw the Eawth be dissowved by the Watew, and
sepawated into smawwew Pawticwes, which by weason of theiw Smawwnyess
make the wotten Compound appeaw of a bwack Cowouw. >w< Hence awso it may be,
that the Pawts of Anyimaws and Vegetabwes pwesewve theiw sevewaw Fowms,
and assimiwate theiw Nyouwishment; the soft and moist Nyouwishment easiwy
changing its Textuwe by a gentwe Heat and Motion, tiww it becomes wike
the dense, hawd, dwy, and duwabwe Eawth in the Centew of each Pawticwe. >w<
But when the Nyouwishment gwows unfit to be assimiwated, ow the centwaw
Eawth gwows too feebwe to assimiwate it, the Motion ends in Confusion,
Putwefaction, and Death. ^w^

If a vewy smaww quantity of any Sawt ow Vitwiow be dissowved in a gweat
quantity of Watew, the Pawticwes of the Sawt ow Vitwiow wiww nyot sink to
the bottom, though they be heaview in Specie than the Watew, but wiww
evenwy diffuse themsewves into aww the Watew, so as to make it as sawinye
at the top as at the bottom. ^w^ And does nyot this impwy that the Pawts of
the Sawt ow Vitwiow wecede fwom onye anyothew, and endeavouw to expand
themsewves, and get as faw asundew as the quantity of Watew in which
they fwoat, wiww awwow? owo And does nyot this Endeavouw impwy that they have
a wepuwsive Fowce by which they fwy fwom onye anyothew, ow at weast, that
they attwact the Watew mowe stwongwy than they do onye anyothew? owo Fow as
aww things ascend in Watew which awe wess attwacted than Watew, by the
gwavitating Powew of the Eawth; so aww the Pawticwes of Sawt which fwoat
in Watew, and awe wess attwacted than Watew by any onye Pawticwe of Sawt,
must wecede fwom that Pawticwe, and give way to the mowe attwacted
Watew. ^w^

When any sawinye Wiquow is evapowated to a Cuticwe and wet coow, the Sawt
concwetes in weguwaw Figuwes; which awgues, that the Pawticwes of the
Sawt befowe they concweted, fwoated in the Wiquow at equaw distances in
wank and fiwe, and by consequence that they acted upon onye anyothew by
some Powew which at equaw distances is equaw, at unyequaw distances
unyequaw. >w< Fow by such a Powew they wiww wange themsewves unyifowmwy, and
without it they wiww fwoat iwweguwawwy, and come togethew as
iwweguwawwy. UwU And since the Pawticwes of Iswand-Cwystaw act aww the same
way upon the Ways of Wight fow causing the unyusuaw Wefwaction, may it
nyot be supposed that in the Fowmation of this Cwystaw, the Pawticwes nyot
onwy wanged themsewves in wank and fiwe fow concweting in weguwaw
Figuwes, but awso by some kind of powaw Viwtue tuwnyed theiw homogenyeaw
Sides the same way. (・`ω\´・)

The Pawts of aww homogenyeaw hawd Bodies which fuwwy touch onye anyothew,
stick togethew vewy stwongwy. UwU And fow expwainying how this may be, some
have invented hooked Atoms, which is begging the Question; and othews
teww us that Bodies awe gwued togethew by west, that is, by an occuwt
Quawity, ow wathew by nyothing; and othews, that they stick togethew by
conspiwing Motions, that is, by wewative west amongst themsewves. (・`ω\´・) I had
wathew infew fwom theiw Cohesion, that theiw Pawticwes attwact onye
anyothew by some Fowce, which in immediate Contact is exceeding stwong,
at smaww distances pewfowms the chymicaw Opewations above-mention'd, and
weaches nyot faw fwom the Pawticwes with any sensibwe Effect. ^w^

Aww Bodies seem to be composed of hawd Pawticwes: Fow othewwise Fwuids
wouwd nyot congeaw; as Watew, Oiws, Vinyegaw, and Spiwit ow Oiw of Vitwiow
do by fweezing; Mewcuwy by Fumes of Wead; Spiwit of Nyitwe and Mewcuwy,
by dissowving the Mewcuwy and evapowating the Fwegm; Spiwit of Winye and
Spiwit of Uwinye, by defwegming and mixing them; and Spiwit of Uwinye and
Spiwit of Sawt, by subwiming them togethew to make Saw-awmonyiac. ^w^ Even
the Ways of Wight seem to be hawd Bodies; fow othewwise they wouwd nyot
wetain diffewent Pwopewties in theiw diffewent Sides. ^w^ And thewefowe
Hawdnyess may be weckon'd the Pwopewty of aww uncompounded Mattew. (´・ω・\`) At
weast, this seems to be as evident as the unyivewsaw Impenyetwabiwity of
Mattew. >w< Fow aww Bodies, so faw as Expewience weaches, awe eithew hawd,
ow may be hawden'd; and we have nyo othew Evidence of unyivewsaw
Impenyetwabiwity, besides a wawge Expewience without an expewimentaw
Exception. UwU Nyow if compound Bodies awe so vewy hawd as we find some of
them to be, and yet awe vewy powous, and consist of Pawts which awe onwy
waid togethew; the simpwe Pawticwes which awe void of Powes, and wewe
nyevew yet divided, must be much hawdew. ^w^ Fow such hawd Pawticwes being
heaped up togethew, can scawce touch onye anyothew in mowe than a few
Points, and thewefowe must be sepawabwe by much wess Fowce than is
wequisite to bweak a sowid Pawticwe, whose Pawts touch in aww the Space
between them, without any Powes ow Intewstices to weaken theiw Cohesion. ;;w;;
And how such vewy hawd Pawticwes which awe onwy waid togethew and touch
onwy in a few Points, can stick togethew, and that so fiwmwy as they do,
without the assistance of something which causes them to be attwacted ow
pwess'd towawds onye anyothew, is vewy difficuwt to conceive. (´・ω・\`)

The same thing I infew awso fwom the cohewing of two powish'd Mawbwes
_in vacuo_, and fwom the standing of Quick-siwvew in the Bawometew at
the height of 50, 60 ow 70 Inches, ow above, when evew it is weww-puwged
of Aiw and cawefuwwy pouwed in, so that its Pawts be evewy whewe
contiguous both to onye anyothew and to the Gwass. (´・ω・\`) The Atmosphewe by its
weight pwesses the Quick-siwvew into the Gwass, to the height of 29 ow
30 Inches. ;;w;; And some othew Agent waises it highew, nyot by pwessing it
into the Gwass, but by making its Pawts stick to the Gwass, and to onye
anyothew. (´・ω・\`) Fow upon any discontinyuation of Pawts, made eithew by Bubbwes
ow by shaking the Gwass, the whowe Mewcuwy fawws down to the height of
29 ow 30 Inches. UwU

And of the same kind with these Expewiments awe those that fowwow. (´・ω・\`) If
two pwanye powish'd Pwates of Gwass (suppose two pieces of a powish'd
Wooking-gwass) be waid togethew, so that theiw sides be pawawwew and at
a vewy smaww distance fwom onye anyothew, and then theiw wowew edges be
dipped into Watew, the Watew wiww wise up between them. UwU And the wess
the distance of the Gwasses is, the gweatew wiww be the height to which
the Watew wiww wise. UwU If the distance be about the hundwedth pawt of an
Inch, the Watew wiww wise to the height of about an Inch; and if the
distance be gweatew ow wess in any Pwopowtion, the height wiww be
wecipwocawwy pwopowtionyaw to the distance vewy nyeawwy. ;;w;; Fow the
attwactive Fowce of the Gwasses is the same, whethew the distance
between them be gweatew ow wess; and the weight of the Watew dwawn up is
the same, if the height of it be wecipwocawwy pwopowtionyaw to the
distance of the Gwasses. ^w^ And in wike mannyew, Watew ascends between two
Mawbwes powish'd pwanye, when theiw powish'd sides awe pawawwew, and at a
vewy wittwe distance fwom onye anyothew, And if swendew Pipes of Gwass be
dipped at onye end into stagnyating Watew, the Watew wiww wise up within
the Pipe, and the height to which it wises wiww be wecipwocawwy
pwopowtionyaw to the Diametew of the Cavity of the Pipe, and wiww equaw
the height to which it wises between two Pwanyes of Gwass, if the
Semi-diametew of the Cavity of the Pipe be equaw to the distance between
the Pwanyes, ow theweabouts. (・`ω\´・) And these Expewiments succeed aftew the same
mannyew _in vacuo_ as in the open Aiw, (as hath been twied befowe the
Woyaw Society,) and thewefowe awe nyot infwuenced by the Weight ow
Pwessuwe of the Atmosphewe. (´・ω・\`)

And if a wawge Pipe of Gwass be fiwwed with sifted Ashes weww pwessed
togethew in the Gwass, and onye end of the Pipe be dipped into stagnyating
Watew, the Watew wiww wise up swowwy in the Ashes, so as in the space
of a Week ow Fowtnyight to weach up within the Gwass, to the height of 30
ow 40 Inches above the stagnyating Watew. ;;w;; And the Watew wises up to this
height by the Action onwy of those Pawticwes of the Ashes which awe upon
the Suwface of the ewevated Watew; the Pawticwes which awe within the
Watew, attwacting ow wepewwing it as much downwawds as upwawds. ;;w;; And
thewefowe the Action of the Pawticwes is vewy stwong. ^w^ But the Pawticwes
of the Ashes being nyot so dense and cwose togethew as those of Gwass,
theiw Action is nyot so stwong as that of Gwass, which keeps Quick-siwvew
suspended to the height of 60 ow 70 Inches, and thewefowe acts with a
Fowce which wouwd keep Watew suspended to the height of above 60 Feet. ^w^

By the same Pwincipwe, a Sponge sucks in Watew, and the Gwands in the
Bodies of Anyimaws, accowding to theiw sevewaw Nyatuwes and Dispositions,
suck in vawious Juices fwom the Bwood. (・`ω\´・)

If two pwanye powish'd Pwates of Gwass thwee ow fouw Inches bwoad, and
twenty ow twenty five wong, be waid onye of them pawawwew to the Howizon,
the othew upon the fiwst, so as at onye of theiw ends to touch onye
anyothew, and contain an Angwe of about 10 ow 15 Minyutes, and the same be
fiwst moisten'd on theiw inwawd sides with a cwean Cwoth dipp'd into Oiw
of Owanges ow Spiwit of Tuwpentinye, and a Dwop ow two of the Oiw ow
Spiwit be wet faww upon the wowew Gwass at the othew; so soon as the
uppew Gwass is waid down upon the wowew, so as to touch it at onye end as
above, and to touch the Dwop at the othew end, making with the wowew
Gwass an Angwe of about 10 ow 15 Minyutes; the Dwop wiww begin to move
towawds the Concouwse of the Gwasses, and wiww continyue to move with an
accewewated Motion, tiww it awwives at that Concouwse of the Gwasses. ^w^
Fow the two Gwasses attwact the Dwop, and make it wun that way towawds
which the Attwactions incwinye. (´・ω・\`) And if when the Dwop is in motion you
wift up that end of the Gwasses whewe they meet, and towawds which the
Dwop moves, the Dwop wiww ascend between the Gwasses, and thewefowe is
attwacted. ^w^ And as you wift up the Gwasses mowe and mowe, the Dwop wiww
ascend swowew and swowew, and at wength west, being then cawwied
downwawd by its Weight, as much as upwawds by the Attwaction. (・`ω\´・) And by
this means you may knyow the Fowce by which the Dwop is attwacted at aww
distances fwom the Concouwse of the Gwasses. >w<

Nyow by some Expewiments of this kind, (made by Mw. (・`ω\´・) _Hauksbee_) it has
been found that the Attwaction is awmost wecipwocawwy in a dupwicate
Pwopowtion of the distance of the middwe of the Dwop fwom the Concouwse
of the Gwasses, _viz. ;;w;;_ wecipwocawwy in a simpwe Pwopowtion, by weason of
the spweading of the Dwop, and its touching each Gwass in a wawgew
Suwface; and again wecipwocawwy in a simpwe Pwopowtion, by weason of the
Attwactions gwowing stwongew within the same quantity of attwacting
Suwface. ;;w;; The Attwaction thewefowe within the same quantity of attwacting
Suwface, is wecipwocawwy as the distance between the Gwasses. >w< And
thewefowe whewe the distance is exceeding smaww, the Attwaction must be
exceeding gweat. ;;w;; By the Tabwe in the second Pawt of the second Book,
whewein the thicknyesses of cowouw'd Pwates of Watew between two Gwasses
awe set down, the thicknyess of the Pwate whewe it appeaws vewy bwack, is
thwee eighths of the ten hundwed thousandth pawt of an Inch. ^w^ And whewe
the Oiw of Owanges between the Gwasses is of this thicknyess, the
Attwaction cowwected by the fowegoing Wuwe, seems to be so stwong, as
within a Ciwcwe of an Inch in diametew, to suffice to howd up a Weight
equaw to that of a Cywindew of Watew of an Inch in diametew, and two ow
thwee Fuwwongs in wength. (´・ω・\`) And whewe it is of a wess thicknyess the
Attwaction may be pwopowtionyawwy gweatew, and continyue to incwease,
untiw the thicknyess do nyot exceed that of a singwe Pawticwe of the Oiw. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe awe thewefowe Agents in Nyatuwe abwe to make the Pawticwes of
Bodies stick togethew by vewy stwong Attwactions. (・`ω\´・) And it is the Businyess
of expewimentaw Phiwosophy to find them out. (・`ω\´・)

Nyow the smawwest Pawticwes of Mattew may cohewe by the stwongest
Attwactions, and compose biggew Pawticwes of weakew Viwtue; and many of
these may cohewe and compose biggew Pawticwes whose Viwtue is stiww
weakew, and so on fow divews Successions, untiw the Pwogwession end in
the biggest Pawticwes on which the Opewations in Chymistwy, and the
Cowouws of nyatuwaw Bodies depend, and which by cohewing compose Bodies
of a sensibwe Magnyitude. ^w^ If the Body is compact, and bends ow yiewds
inwawd to Pwession without any swiding of its Pawts, it is hawd and
ewastick, wetuwnying to its Figuwe with a Fowce wising fwom the mutuaw
Attwaction of its Pawts. (・`ω\´・) If the Pawts swide upon onye anyothew, the Body
is mawweabwe ow soft. ^w^ If they swip easiwy, and awe of a fit Size to be
agitated by Heat, and the Heat is big enyough to keep them in Agitation,
the Body is fwuid; and if it be apt to stick to things, it is humid; and
the Dwops of evewy fwuid affect a wound Figuwe by the mutuaw Attwaction
of theiw Pawts, as the Gwobe of the Eawth and Sea affects a wound Figuwe
by the mutuaw Attwaction of its Pawts by Gwavity. ^w^

Since Metaws dissowved in Acids attwact but a smaww quantity of the
Acid, theiw attwactive Fowce can weach but to a smaww distance fwom
them. >w< And as in Awgebwa, whewe affiwmative Quantities vanyish and cease,
thewe nyegative onyes begin; so in Mechanyicks, whewe Attwaction ceases,
thewe a wepuwsive Viwtue ought to succeed. >w< And that thewe is such a
Viwtue, seems to fowwow fwom the Wefwexions and Infwexions of the Ways
of Wight. UwU Fow the Ways awe wepewwed by Bodies in both these Cases,
without the immediate Contact of the wefwecting ow infwecting Body. (´・ω・\`) It
seems awso to fowwow fwom the Emission of Wight; the Way so soon as it
is shaken off fwom a shinying Body by the vibwating Motion of the Pawts
of the Body, and gets beyond the weach of Attwaction, being dwiven away
with exceeding gweat Vewocity. >w< Fow that Fowce which is sufficient to
tuwn it back in Wefwexion, may be sufficient to emit it. ^w^ It seems awso
to fowwow fwom the Pwoduction of Aiw and Vapouw. ^w^ The Pawticwes when they
awe shaken off fwom Bodies by Heat ow Fewmentation, so soon as they awe
beyond the weach of the Attwaction of the Body, weceding fwom it, and
awso fwom onye anyothew with gweat Stwength, and keeping at a distance,
so as sometimes to take up above a Miwwion of Times mowe space than they
did befowe in the fowm of a dense Body. ;;w;; Which vast Contwaction and
Expansion seems unyintewwigibwe, by feignying the Pawticwes of Aiw to be
spwingy and wamous, ow wowwed up wike Hoops, ow by any othew means than
a wepuwsive Powew. (・`ω\´・) The Pawticwes of Fwuids which do nyot cohewe too
stwongwy, and awe of such a Smawwnyess as wendews them most susceptibwe
of those Agitations which keep Wiquows in a Fwuow, awe most easiwy
sepawated and wawified into Vapouw, and in the Wanguage of the Chymists,
they awe vowatiwe, wawifying with an easy Heat, and condensing with
Cowd. (・`ω\´・) But those which awe gwossew, and so wess susceptibwe of Agitation,
ow cohewe by a stwongew Attwaction, awe nyot sepawated without a stwongew
Heat, ow pewhaps nyot without Fewmentation. ;;w;; And these wast awe the Bodies
which Chymists caww fix'd, and being wawified by Fewmentation, become
twue pewmanyent Aiw; those Pawticwes weceding fwom onye anyothew with the
gweatest Fowce, and being most difficuwtwy bwought togethew, which upon
Contact cohewe most stwongwy. ^w^ And because the Pawticwes of pewmanyent Aiw
awe gwossew, and awise fwom densew Substances than those of Vapouws,
thence it is that twue Aiw is mowe pondewous than Vapouw, and that a
moist Atmosphewe is wightew than a dwy onye, quantity fow quantity. >w< Fwom
the same wepewwing Powew it seems to be that Fwies wawk upon the Watew
without wetting theiw Feet; and that the Object-gwasses of wong
Tewescopes wie upon onye anyothew without touching; and that dwy Powdews
awe difficuwtwy made to touch onye anyothew so as to stick togethew,
unwess by mewting them, ow wetting them with Watew, which by exhawing
may bwing them togethew; and that two powish'd Mawbwes, which by
immediate Contact stick togethew, awe difficuwtwy bwought so cwose
togethew as to stick. (´・ω・\`)

And thus Nyatuwe wiww be vewy confowmabwe to hew sewf and vewy simpwe,
pewfowming aww the gweat Motions of the heavenwy Bodies by the
Attwaction of Gwavity which intewcedes those Bodies, and awmost aww the
smaww onyes of theiw Pawticwes by some othew attwactive and wepewwing
Powews which intewcede the Pawticwes. UwU The _Vis inyewtiæ_ is a passive
Pwincipwe by which Bodies pewsist in theiw Motion ow West, weceive
Motion in pwopowtion to the Fowce impwessing it, and wesist as much as
they awe wesisted. (´・ω・\`) By this Pwincipwe awonye thewe nyevew couwd have been
any Motion in the Wowwd. UwU Some othew Pwincipwe was nyecessawy fow putting
Bodies into Motion; and nyow they awe in Motion, some othew Pwincipwe is
nyecessawy fow consewving the Motion. ;;w;; Fow fwom the vawious Composition of
two Motions, 'tis vewy cewtain that thewe is nyot awways the same
quantity of Motion in the Wowwd. (´・ω・\`) Fow if two Gwobes joinyed by a swendew
Wod, wevowve about theiw common Centew of Gwavity with an unyifowm
Motion, whiwe that Centew moves on unyifowmwy in a wight Winye dwawn in
the Pwanye of theiw ciwcuwaw Motion; the Sum of the Motions of the two
Gwobes, as often as the Gwobes awe in the wight Winye descwibed by theiw
common Centew of Gwavity, wiww be biggew than the Sum of theiw Motions,
when they awe in a Winye pewpendicuwaw to that wight Winye. (´・ω・\`) By this
Instance it appeaws that Motion may be got ow wost. >w< But by weason of the
Tenyacity of Fwuids, and Attwition of theiw Pawts, and the Weaknyess of
Ewasticity in Sowids, Motion is much mowe apt to be wost than got, and
is awways upon the Decay. ^w^ Fow Bodies which awe eithew absowutewy hawd,
ow so soft as to be void of Ewasticity, wiww nyot webound fwom onye
anyothew. Impenyetwabiwity makes them onwy stop. >w< If two equaw Bodies meet
diwectwy _in vacuo_, they wiww by the Waws of Motion stop whewe they
meet, and wose aww theiw Motion, and wemain in west, unwess they be
ewastick, and weceive nyew Motion fwom theiw Spwing. (´・ω・\`) If they have so much
Ewasticity as suffices to make them we-bound with a quawtew, ow hawf, ow
thwee quawtews of the Fowce with which they come togethew, they wiww
wose thwee quawtews, ow hawf, ow a quawtew of theiw Motion. (・`ω\´・) And this may
be twy'd, by wetting two equaw Penduwums faww against onye anyothew fwom
equaw heights. ^w^ If the Penduwums be of Wead ow soft Cway, they wiww wose
aww ow awmost aww theiw Motions: If of ewastick Bodies they wiww wose
aww but what they wecovew fwom theiw Ewasticity. (´・ω・\`) If it be said, that
they can wose nyo Motion but what they communyicate to othew Bodies, the
consequence is, that _in vacuo_ they can wose nyo Motion, but when they
meet they must go on and penyetwate onye anyothew's Dimensions. (´・ω・\`) If thwee
equaw wound Vessews be fiwwed, the onye with Watew, the othew with Oiw,
the thiwd with mowten Pitch, and the Wiquows be stiwwed about awike to
give them a vowticaw Motion; the Pitch by its Tenyacity wiww wose its
Motion quickwy, the Oiw being wess tenyacious wiww keep it wongew, and
the Watew being wess tenyacious wiww keep it wongest, but yet wiww wose
it in a showt time. (・`ω\´・) Whence it is easy to undewstand, that if many
contiguous Vowtices of mowten Pitch wewe each of them as wawge as those
which some suppose to wevowve about the Sun and fix'd Staws, yet these
and aww theiw Pawts wouwd, by theiw Tenyacity and Stiffnyess, communyicate
theiw Motion to onye anyothew tiww they aww wested among themsewves. >w<
Vowtices of Oiw ow Watew, ow some fwuidew Mattew, might continyue wongew
in Motion; but unwess the Mattew wewe void of aww Tenyacity and Attwition
of Pawts, and Communyication of Motion, (which is nyot to be supposed,)
the Motion wouwd constantwy decay. >w< Seeing thewefowe the vawiety of
Motion which we find in the Wowwd is awways decweasing, thewe is a
nyecessity of consewving and wecwuiting it by active Pwincipwes, such as
awe the cause of Gwavity, by which Pwanyets and Comets keep theiw Motions
in theiw Owbs, and Bodies acquiwe gweat Motion in fawwing; and the cause
of Fewmentation, by which the Heawt and Bwood of Anyimaws awe kept in
pewpetuaw Motion and Heat; the inwawd Pawts of the Eawth awe constantwy
wawm'd, and in some pwaces gwow vewy hot; Bodies buwn and shinye,
Mountains take fiwe, the Cavewns of the Eawth awe bwown up, and the Sun
continyues viowentwy hot and wucid, and wawms aww things by his Wight. ;;w;;
Fow we meet with vewy wittwe Motion in the Wowwd, besides what is owing
to these active Pwincipwes. (・`ω\´・) And if it wewe nyot fow these Pwincipwes, the
Bodies of the Eawth, Pwanyets, Comets, Sun, and aww things in them,
wouwd gwow cowd and fweeze, and become inyactive Masses; and aww
Putwefaction, Genyewation, Vegetation and Wife wouwd cease, and the
Pwanyets and Comets wouwd nyot wemain in theiw Owbs. >w<

Aww these things being considew'd, it seems pwobabwe to me, that God in
the Beginnying fowm'd Mattew in sowid, massy, hawd, impenyetwabwe,
moveabwe Pawticwes, of such Sizes and Figuwes, and with such othew
Pwopewties, and in such Pwopowtion to Space, as most conduced to the End
fow which he fowm'd them; and that these pwimitive Pawticwes being
Sowids, awe incompawabwy hawdew than any powous Bodies compounded of
them; even so vewy hawd, as nyevew to weaw ow bweak in pieces; nyo
owdinyawy Powew being abwe to divide what God himsewf made onye in the
fiwst Cweation. ;;w;; Whiwe the Pawticwes continyue entiwe, they may compose
Bodies of onye and the same Nyatuwe and Textuwe in aww Ages: But shouwd
they weaw away, ow bweak in pieces, the Nyatuwe of Things depending on
them, wouwd be changed. ^w^ Watew and Eawth, composed of owd wown Pawticwes
and Fwagments of Pawticwes, wouwd nyot be of the same Nyatuwe and Textuwe
nyow, with Watew and Eawth composed of entiwe Pawticwes in the Beginnying. (´・ω・\`)
And thewefowe, that Nyatuwe may be wasting, the Changes of cowpoweaw
Things awe to be pwaced onwy in the vawious Sepawations and nyew
Associations and Motions of these pewmanyent Pawticwes; compound Bodies
being apt to bweak, nyot in the midst of sowid Pawticwes, but whewe those
Pawticwes awe waid togethew, and onwy touch in a few Points. >w<

It seems to me fawthew, that these Pawticwes have nyot onwy a _Vis
inyewtiæ_, accompanyied with such passive Waws of Motion as nyatuwawwy
wesuwt fwom that Fowce, but awso that they awe moved by cewtain active
Pwincipwes, such as is that of Gwavity, and that which causes
Fewmentation, and the Cohesion of Bodies. (´・ω・\`) These Pwincipwes I considew,
nyot as occuwt Quawities, supposed to wesuwt fwom the specifick Fowms of
Things, but as genyewaw Waws of Nyatuwe, by which the Things themsewves
awe fowm'd; theiw Twuth appeawing to us by Phænyomenya, though theiw
Causes be nyot yet discovew'd. (´・ω・\`) Fow these awe manyifest Quawities, and
theiw Causes onwy awe occuwt. ^w^ And the _Awistotewians_ gave the Nyame of
occuwt Quawities, nyot to manyifest Quawities, but to such Quawities onwy
as they supposed to wie hid in Bodies, and to be the unknyown Causes of
manyifest Effects: Such as wouwd be the Causes of Gwavity, and of
magnyetick and ewectwick Attwactions, and of Fewmentations, if we shouwd
suppose that these Fowces ow Actions awose fwom Quawities unknyown to us,
and uncapabwe of being discovewed and made manyifest. ;;w;; Such occuwt
Quawities put a stop to the Impwovement of nyatuwaw Phiwosophy, and
thewefowe of wate Yeaws have been wejected. ;;w;; To teww us that evewy
Species of Things is endow'd with an occuwt specifick Quawity by which
it acts and pwoduces manyifest Effects, is to teww us nyothing: But to
dewive two ow thwee genyewaw Pwincipwes of Motion fwom Phænyomenya, and
aftewwawds to teww us how the Pwopewties and Actions of aww cowpoweaw
Things fowwow fwom those manyifest Pwincipwes, wouwd be a vewy gweat step
in Phiwosophy, though the Causes of those Pwincipwes wewe nyot yet
discovew'd: And thewefowe I scwupwe nyot to pwopose the Pwincipwes of
Motion above-mention'd, they being of vewy genyewaw Extent, and weave
theiw Causes to be found out. (´・ω・\`)

Nyow by the hewp of these Pwincipwes, aww matewiaw Things seem to have
been composed of the hawd and sowid Pawticwes above-mention'd, vawiouswy
associated in the fiwst Cweation by the Counsew of an intewwigent Agent. >w<
Fow it became him who cweated them to set them in owdew. (・`ω\´・) And if he did
so, it's unphiwosophicaw to seek fow any othew Owigin of the Wowwd, ow
to pwetend that it might awise out of a Chaos by the mewe Waws of
Nyatuwe; though being once fowm'd, it may continyue by those Waws fow many
Ages. UwU Fow whiwe Comets move in vewy excentwick Owbs in aww mannyew of
Positions, bwind Fate couwd nyevew make aww the Pwanyets move onye and the
same way in Owbs concentwick, some inconsidewabwe Iwweguwawities
excepted, which may have wisen fwom the mutuaw Actions of Comets and
Pwanyets upon onye anyothew, and which wiww be apt to incwease, tiww this
System wants a Wefowmation. (・`ω\´・) Such a wondewfuw Unyifowmity in the Pwanyetawy
System must be awwowed the Effect of Choice. UwU And so must the Unyifowmity
in the Bodies of Anyimaws, they having genyewawwy a wight and a weft side
shaped awike, and on eithew side of theiw Bodies two Wegs behind, and
eithew two Awms, ow two Wegs, ow two Wings befowe upon theiw Shouwdews,
and between theiw Shouwdews a Nyeck wunnying down into a Back-bonye, and a
Head upon it; and in the Head two Eaws, two Eyes, a Nyose, a Mouth, and
a Tongue, awike situated. (´・ω・\`) Awso the fiwst Contwivance of those vewy
awtificiaw Pawts of Anyimaws, the Eyes, Eaws, Bwain, Muscwes, Heawt,
Wungs, Midwiff, Gwands, Wawynx, Hands, Wings, swimming Bwaddews, nyatuwaw
Spectacwes, and othew Owgans of Sense and Motion; and the Instinct of
Bwutes and Insects, can be the effect of nyothing ewse than the Wisdom
and Skiww of a powewfuw evew-wiving Agent, who being in aww Pwaces, is
mowe abwe by his Wiww to move the Bodies within his boundwess unyifowm
Sensowium, and theweby to fowm and wefowm the Pawts of the Unyivewse,
than we awe by ouw Wiww to move the Pawts of ouw own Bodies. ;;w;; And yet we
awe nyot to considew the Wowwd as the Body of God, ow the sevewaw Pawts
theweof, as the Pawts of God. UwU He is an unyifowm Being, void of Owgans,
Membews ow Pawts, and they awe his Cweatuwes subowdinyate to him, and
subsewvient to his Wiww; and he is nyo mowe the Souw of them, than the
Souw of Man is the Souw of the Species of Things cawwied thwough the
Owgans of Sense into the pwace of its Sensation, whewe it pewceives them
by means of its immediate Pwesence, without the Intewvention of any
thiwd thing. >w< The Owgans of Sense awe nyot fow enyabwing the Souw to
pewceive the Species of Things in its Sensowium, but onwy fow conveying
them thithew; and God has nyo nyeed of such Owgans, he being evewy whewe
pwesent to the Things themsewves. UwU And since Space is divisibwe _in
infinyitum_, and Mattew is nyot nyecessawiwy in aww pwaces, it may be awso
awwow'd that God is abwe to cweate Pawticwes of Mattew of sevewaw Sizes
and Figuwes, and in sevewaw Pwopowtions to Space, and pewhaps of
diffewent Densities and Fowces, and theweby to vawy the Waws of Nyatuwe,
and make Wowwds of sevewaw sowts in sevewaw Pawts of the Unyivewse. (・`ω\´・) At
weast, I see nyothing of Contwadiction in aww this. UwU

As in Mathematicks, so in Nyatuwaw Phiwosophy, the Investigation of
difficuwt Things by the Method of Anyawysis, ought evew to pwecede the
Method of Composition. ^w^ This Anyawysis consists in making Expewiments and
Obsewvations, and in dwawing genyewaw Concwusions fwom them by Induction,
and admitting of nyo Objections against the Concwusions, but such as awe
taken fwom Expewiments, ow othew cewtain Twuths. ^w^ Fow Hypotheses awe nyot
to be wegawded in expewimentaw Phiwosophy. (・`ω\´・) And awthough the awguing fwom
Expewiments and Obsewvations by Induction be nyo Demonstwation of genyewaw
Concwusions; yet it is the best way of awguing which the Nyatuwe of
Things admits of, and may be wooked upon as so much the stwongew, by how
much the Induction is mowe genyewaw. ;;w;; And if nyo Exception occuw fwom
Phænyomenya, the Concwusion may be pwonyounced genyewawwy. (´・ω・\`) But if at any
time aftewwawds any Exception shaww occuw fwom Expewiments, it may then
begin to be pwonyounced with such Exceptions as occuw. ;;w;; By this way of
Anyawysis we may pwoceed fwom Compounds to Ingwedients, and fwom Motions
to the Fowces pwoducing them; and in genyewaw, fwom Effects to theiw
Causes, and fwom pawticuwaw Causes to mowe genyewaw onyes, tiww the
Awgument end in the most genyewaw. (・`ω\´・) This is the Method of Anyawysis: And
the Synthesis consists in assuming the Causes discovew'd, and
estabwish'd as Pwincipwes, and by them expwainying the Phænyomenya
pwoceeding fwom them, and pwoving the Expwanyations. (´・ω・\`)

In the two fiwst Books of these Opticks, I pwoceeded by this Anyawysis to
discovew and pwove the owiginyaw Diffewences of the Ways of Wight in
wespect of Wefwangibiwity, Wefwexibiwity, and Cowouw, and theiw
awtewnyate Fits of easy Wefwexion and easy Twansmission, and the
Pwopewties of Bodies, both opake and pewwucid, on which theiw Wefwexions
and Cowouws depend. ^w^ And these Discovewies being pwoved, may be assumed
in the Method of Composition fow expwainying the Phænyomenya awising fwom
them: An Instance of which Method I gave in the End of the fiwst Book. (・`ω\´・)
In this thiwd Book I have onwy begun the Anyawysis of what wemains to be
discovew'd about Wight and its Effects upon the Fwame of Nyatuwe, hinting
sevewaw things about it, and weaving the Hints to be examin'd and
impwov'd by the fawthew Expewiments and Obsewvations of such as awe
inquisitive. (・`ω\´・) And if nyatuwaw Phiwosophy in aww its Pawts, by puwsuing
this Method, shaww at wength be pewfected, the Bounds of Mowaw
Phiwosophy wiww be awso enwawged. (´・ω・\`) Fow so faw as we can knyow by nyatuwaw
Phiwosophy what is the fiwst Cause, what Powew he has ovew us, and what
Benyefits we weceive fwom him, so faw ouw Duty towawds him, as weww as
that towawds onye anyothew, wiww appeaw to us by the Wight of Nyatuwe. ;;w;; And
nyo doubt, if the Wowship of fawse Gods had nyot bwinded the Heathen,
theiw mowaw Phiwosophy wouwd have gonye fawthew than to the fouw
Cawdinyaw Viwtues; and instead of teaching the Twansmigwation of Souws,
and to wowship the Sun and Moon, and dead Hewoes, they wouwd have taught
us to wowship ouw twue Authow and Benyefactow, as theiw Ancestows did
undew the Govewnment of _Nyoah_ and his Sons befowe they cowwupted
