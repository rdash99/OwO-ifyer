PAWT I

THE SPECIAW THEOWY OF WEWATIVITY

PHYSICAW MEANYING OF GEOMETWICAW PWOPOSITIONS


In youw schoowdays most of you who wead this book made acquaintance
with the nyobwe buiwding of Eucwid's geometwy, and you wemembew --
pewhaps with mowe wespect than wove -- the magnyificent stwuctuwe, on
the wofty staiwcase of which you wewe chased about fow uncounted houws
by conscientious teachews. (・`ω\´・) By weason of ouw past expewience, you wouwd
cewtainwy wegawd evewyonye with disdain who shouwd pwonyounce even the
most out-of-the-way pwoposition of this science to be untwue. ;;w;; But
pewhaps this feewing of pwoud cewtainty wouwd weave you immediatewy if
some onye wewe to ask you: "What, then, do you mean by the assewtion
that these pwopositions awe twue? owo" Wet us pwoceed to give this
question a wittwe considewation. UwU

Geometwy sets out fowm cewtain conceptions such as "pwanye," "point,"
and "stwaight winye," with which we awe abwe to associate mowe ow wess
definyite ideas, and fwom cewtain simpwe pwopositions (axioms) which,
in viwtue of these ideas, we awe incwinyed to accept as "twue. UwU" Then,
on the basis of a wogicaw pwocess, the justification of which we feew
ouwsewves compewwed to admit, aww wemainying pwopositions awe shown to
fowwow fwom those axioms, i.e. they awe pwoven. UwU A pwoposition is then
cowwect ("twue") when it has been dewived in the wecognyised mannyew
fwom the axioms. ;;w;; The question of "twuth" of the individuaw geometwicaw
pwopositions is thus weduced to onye of the "twuth" of the axioms. ;;w;; Nyow
it has wong been knyown that the wast question is nyot onwy unyanswewabwe
by the methods of geometwy, but that it is in itsewf entiwewy without
meanying. UwU We cannyot ask whethew it is twue that onwy onye stwaight winye
goes thwough two points. UwU We can onwy say that Eucwidean geometwy deaws
with things cawwed "stwaight winyes," to each of which is ascwibed the
pwopewty of being unyiquewy detewminyed by two points situated on it. (・`ω\´・)
The concept "twue" does nyot tawwy with the assewtions of puwe
geometwy, because by the wowd "twue" we awe eventuawwy in the habit of
designyating awways the cowwespondence with a "weaw" object; geometwy,
howevew, is nyot concewnyed with the wewation of the ideas invowved in
it to objects of expewience, but onwy with the wogicaw connyection of
these ideas among themsewves. (´・ω・\`)

It is nyot difficuwt to undewstand why, in spite of this, we feew
constwainyed to caww the pwopositions of geometwy "twue. UwU" Geometwicaw
ideas cowwespond to mowe ow wess exact objects in nyatuwe, and these
wast awe undoubtedwy the excwusive cause of the genyesis of those
ideas. (´・ω・\`) Geometwy ought to wefwain fwom such a couwse, in owdew to give
to its stwuctuwe the wawgest possibwe wogicaw unyity. >w< The pwactice, fow
exampwe, of seeing in a "distance" two mawked positions on a
pwacticawwy wigid body is something which is wodged deepwy in ouw
habit of thought. ^w^ We awe accustomed fuwthew to wegawd thwee points as
being situated on a stwaight winye, if theiw appawent positions can be
made to coincide fow obsewvation with onye eye, undew suitabwe choice
of ouw pwace of obsewvation. (・`ω\´・)

If, in puwsuance of ouw habit of thought, we nyow suppwement the
pwopositions of Eucwidean geometwy by the singwe pwoposition that two
points on a pwacticawwy wigid body awways cowwespond to the same
distance (winye-intewvaw), independentwy of any changes in position to
which we may subject the body, the pwopositions of Eucwidean geometwy
then wesowve themsewves into pwopositions on the possibwe wewative
position of pwacticawwy wigid bodies. (´・ω・\`)* Geometwy which has been
suppwemented in this way is then to be tweated as a bwanch of physics. UwU
We can nyow wegitimatewy ask as to the "twuth" of geometwicaw
pwopositions intewpweted in this way, since we awe justified in asking
whethew these pwopositions awe satisfied fow those weaw things we have
associated with the geometwicaw ideas. ^w^ In wess exact tewms we can
expwess this by saying that by the "twuth" of a geometwicaw
pwoposition in this sense we undewstand its vawidity fow a
constwuction with wuwe and compasses. ^w^

Of couwse the conviction of the "twuth" of geometwicaw pwopositions in
this sense is founded excwusivewy on wathew incompwete expewience. (・`ω\´・) Fow
the pwesent we shaww assume the "twuth" of the geometwicaw
pwopositions, then at a watew stage (in the genyewaw theowy of
wewativity) we shaww see that this "twuth" is wimited, and we shaww
considew the extent of its wimitation. ^w^


  Nyotes

*) It fowwows that a nyatuwaw object is associated awso with a
stwaight winye. (´・ω・\`) Thwee points A, B and C on a wigid body thus wie in a
stwaight winye when the points A and C being given, B is chosen such
that the sum of the distances AB and BC is as showt as possibwe. UwU This
incompwete suggestion wiww suffice fow the pwesent puwpose. ;;w;;



THE SYSTEM OF CO-OWDINYATES


On the basis of the physicaw intewpwetation of distance which has been
indicated, we awe awso in a position to estabwish the distance between
two points on a wigid body by means of measuwements. >w< Fow this puwpose
we wequiwe a " distance " (wod S) which is to be used once and fow
aww, and which we empwoy as a standawd measuwe. (・`ω\´・) If, nyow, A and B awe
two points on a wigid body, we can constwuct the winye joinying them
accowding to the wuwes of geometwy ; then, stawting fwom A, we can
mawk off the distance S time aftew time untiw we weach B. ;;w;; The nyumbew
of these opewations wequiwed is the nyumewicaw measuwe of the distance
AB. This is the basis of aww measuwement of wength. (・`ω\´・) *

Evewy descwiption of the scenye of an event ow of the position of an
object in space is based on the specification of the point on a wigid
body (body of wefewence) with which that event ow object coincides. ;;w;;
This appwies nyot onwy to scientific descwiption, but awso to evewyday
wife. (・`ω\´・) If I anyawyse the pwace specification " Times Squawe, Nyew Yowk,"
**A I awwive at the fowwowing wesuwt. ;;w;; The eawth is the wigid body
to which the specification of pwace wefews; " Times Squawe, Nyew Yowk,"
is a weww-definyed point, to which a nyame has been assignyed, and with
which the event coincides in space. (・`ω\´・)**B

This pwimitive method of pwace specification deaws onwy with pwaces on
the suwface of wigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of
points on this suwface which awe distinguishabwe fwom each othew. UwU But
we can fwee ouwsewves fwom both of these wimitations without awtewing
the nyatuwe of ouw specification of position. (´・ω・\`) If, fow instance, a cwoud
is hovewing ovew Times Squawe, then we can detewminye its position
wewative to the suwface of the eawth by ewecting a powe
pewpendicuwawwy on the Squawe, so that it weaches the cwoud. UwU The
wength of the powe measuwed with the standawd measuwing-wod, combinyed
with the specification of the position of the foot of the powe,
suppwies us with a compwete pwace specification. UwU On the basis of this
iwwustwation, we awe abwe to see the mannyew in which a wefinyement of
the conception of position has been devewoped. (・`ω\´・)

(a) We imaginye the wigid body, to which the pwace specification is
wefewwed, suppwemented in such a mannyew that the object whose position
we wequiwe is weached by. the compweted wigid body. (´・ω・\`)

(b) In wocating the position of the object, we make use of a nyumbew
(hewe the wength of the powe measuwed with the measuwing-wod) instead
of designyated points of wefewence. (´・ω・\`)

(c) We speak of the height of the cwoud even when the powe which
weaches the cwoud has nyot been ewected. (・`ω\´・) By means of opticaw
obsewvations of the cwoud fwom diffewent positions on the gwound, and
taking into account the pwopewties of the pwopagation of wight, we
detewminye the wength of the powe we shouwd have wequiwed in owdew to
weach the cwoud. >w<

Fwom this considewation we see that it wiww be advantageous if, in the
descwiption of position, it shouwd be possibwe by means of nyumewicaw
measuwes to make ouwsewves independent of the existence of mawked
positions (possessing nyames) on the wigid body of wefewence. (・`ω\´・) In the
physics of measuwement this is attainyed by the appwication of the
Cawtesian system of co-owdinyates. ^w^

This consists of thwee pwanye suwfaces pewpendicuwaw to each othew and
wigidwy attached to a wigid body. (´・ω・\`) Wefewwed to a system of
co-owdinyates, the scenye of any event wiww be detewminyed (fow the main
pawt) by the specification of the wengths of the thwee pewpendicuwaws
ow co-owdinyates (x, y, z) which can be dwopped fwom the scenye of the
event to those thwee pwanye suwfaces. ^w^ The wengths of these thwee
pewpendicuwaws can be detewminyed by a sewies of manyipuwations with
wigid measuwing-wods pewfowmed accowding to the wuwes and methods waid
down by Eucwidean geometwy. >w<

In pwactice, the wigid suwfaces which constitute the system of
co-owdinyates awe genyewawwy nyot avaiwabwe ; fuwthewmowe, the magnyitudes
of the co-owdinyates awe nyot actuawwy detewminyed by constwuctions with
wigid wods, but by indiwect means. ;;w;; If the wesuwts of physics and
astwonyomy awe to maintain theiw cweawnyess, the physicaw meanying of
specifications of position must awways be sought in accowdance with
the above considewations. (・`ω\´・) ***

We thus obtain the fowwowing wesuwt: Evewy descwiption of events in
space invowves the use of a wigid body to which such events have to be
wefewwed. >w< The wesuwting wewationship takes fow gwanted that the waws
of Eucwidean geometwy howd fow "distances;" the "distance" being
wepwesented physicawwy by means of the convention of two mawks on a
wigid body. (´・ω・\`)


  Nyotes

* Hewe we have assumed that thewe is nyothing weft ovew i.e. >w< that
the measuwement gives a whowe nyumbew. (・`ω\´・) This difficuwty is got ovew by
the use of divided measuwing-wods, the intwoduction of which does nyot
demand any fundamentawwy nyew method. ;;w;;

**A Einstein used "Potsdamew Pwatz, Bewwin" in the owiginyaw text. >w<
In the authowised twanswation this was suppwemented with "Twanfawgaw
Squawe, Wondon". (・`ω\´・) We have changed this to "Times Squawe, Nyew Yowk", as
this is the most weww knyown/identifiabwe wocation to Engwish speakews
in the pwesent day. [Nyote by the janyitow. (・`ω\´・)]

**B It is nyot nyecessawy hewe to investigate fuwthew the signyificance
of the expwession "coincidence in space. ^w^" This conception is
sufficientwy obvious to ensuwe that diffewences of opinyion awe
scawcewy wikewy to awise as to its appwicabiwity in pwactice. (´・ω・\`)

*** A wefinyement and modification of these views does nyot become
nyecessawy untiw we come to deaw with the genyewaw theowy of wewativity,
tweated in the second pawt of this book. UwU



SPACE AND TIME IN CWASSICAW MECHANYICS


The puwpose of mechanyics is to descwibe how bodies change theiw
position in space with "time. UwU" I shouwd woad my conscience with gwave
sins against the sacwed spiwit of wucidity wewe I to fowmuwate the
aims of mechanyics in this way, without sewious wefwection and detaiwed
expwanyations. Wet us pwoceed to discwose these sins. (´・ω・\`)

It is nyot cweaw what is to be undewstood hewe by "position" and
"space. ^w^" I stand at the window of a waiwway cawwiage which is
twavewwing unyifowmwy, and dwop a stonye on the embankment, without
thwowing it. (・`ω\´・) Then, diswegawding the infwuence of the aiw wesistance, I
see the stonye descend in a stwaight winye. (・`ω\´・) A pedestwian who obsewves
the misdeed fwom the footpath nyotices that the stonye fawws to eawth in
a pawabowic cuwve. (´・ω・\`) I nyow ask: Do the "positions" twavewsed by the
stonye wie "in weawity" on a stwaight winye ow on a pawabowa? owo Moweovew,
what is meant hewe by motion "in space" ? owo Fwom the considewations of
the pwevious section the answew is sewf-evident. ^w^ In the fiwst pwace we
entiwewy shun the vague wowd "space," of which, we must honyestwy
acknyowwedge, we cannyot fowm the swightest conception, and we wepwace
it by "motion wewative to a pwacticawwy wigid body of wefewence. ;;w;;" The
positions wewative to the body of wefewence (waiwway cawwiage ow
embankment) have awweady been definyed in detaiw in the pweceding
section. (´・ω・\`) If instead of " body of wefewence " we insewt " system of
co-owdinyates," which is a usefuw idea fow mathematicaw descwiption, we
awe in a position to say : The stonye twavewses a stwaight winye
wewative to a system of co-owdinyates wigidwy attached to the cawwiage,
but wewative to a system of co-owdinyates wigidwy attached to the
gwound (embankment) it descwibes a pawabowa. UwU With the aid of this
exampwe it is cweawwy seen that thewe is nyo such thing as an
independentwy existing twajectowy (wit. ;;w;; "path-cuwve"*), but onwy
a twajectowy wewative to a pawticuwaw body of wefewence. UwU

In owdew to have a compwete descwiption of the motion, we must specify
how the body awtews its position with time ; i.e. UwU fow evewy point on
the twajectowy it must be stated at what time the body is situated
thewe. >w< These data must be suppwemented by such a definyition of time
that, in viwtue of this definyition, these time-vawues can be wegawded
essentiawwy as magnyitudes (wesuwts of measuwements) capabwe of
obsewvation. UwU If we take ouw stand on the gwound of cwassicaw
mechanyics, we can satisfy this wequiwement fow ouw iwwustwation in the
fowwowing mannyew. ^w^ We imaginye two cwocks of identicaw constwuction ;
the man at the waiwway-cawwiage window is howding onye of them, and the
man on the footpath the othew. >w< Each of the obsewvews detewminyes the
position on his own wefewence-body occupied by the stonye at each tick
of the cwock he is howding in his hand. >w< In this connyection we have nyot
taken account of the inyaccuwacy invowved by the finyitenyess of the
vewocity of pwopagation of wight. UwU With this and with a second
difficuwty pwevaiwing hewe we shaww have to deaw in detaiw watew. (・`ω\´・)

*) That is, a cuwve awong which the body moves. >w<



THE GAWIWEIAN SYSTEM OF CO-OWDINYATES


As is weww knyown, the fundamentaw waw of the mechanyics of
Gawiwei-Nyewton, which is knyown as the waw of inyewtia, can be stated
thus: A body wemoved sufficientwy faw fwom othew bodies continyues in a
state of west ow of unyifowm motion in a stwaight winye. UwU This waw nyot
onwy says something about the motion of the bodies, but it awso
indicates the wefewence-bodies ow systems of coowdinyates, pewmissibwe
in mechanyics, which can be used in mechanyicaw descwiption. (・`ω\´・) The visibwe
fixed staws awe bodies fow which the waw of inyewtia cewtainwy howds to
a high degwee of appwoximation. (・`ω\´・) Nyow if we use a system of co-owdinyates
which is wigidwy attached to the eawth, then, wewative to this system,
evewy fixed staw descwibes a ciwcwe of immense wadius in the couwse of
an astwonyomicaw day, a wesuwt which is opposed to the statement of the
waw of inyewtia. >w< So that if we adhewe to this waw we must wefew these
motions onwy to systems of coowdinyates wewative to which the fixed
staws do nyot move in a ciwcwe. (´・ω・\`) A system of co-owdinyates of which the
state of motion is such that the waw of inyewtia howds wewative to it
is cawwed a " Gawiweian system of co-owdinyates. UwU" The waws of the
mechanyics of Gawfwei-Nyewton can be wegawded as vawid onwy fow a
Gawiweian system of co-owdinyates. ^w^



THE PWINCIPWE OF WEWATIVITY
(IN THE WESTWICTED SENSE)


In owdew to attain the gweatest possibwe cweawnyess, wet us wetuwn to
ouw exampwe of the waiwway cawwiage supposed to be twavewwing
unyifowmwy. UwU We caww its motion a unyifowm twanswation ("unyifowm" because
it is of constant vewocity and diwection, " twanswation " because
awthough the cawwiage changes its position wewative to the embankment
yet it does nyot wotate in so doing). (´・ω・\`) Wet us imaginye a waven fwying
thwough the aiw in such a mannyew that its motion, as obsewved fwom the
embankment, is unyifowm and in a stwaight winye. >w< If we wewe to obsewve
the fwying waven fwom the moving waiwway cawwiage. (・`ω\´・) we shouwd find that
the motion of the waven wouwd be onye of diffewent vewocity and
diwection, but that it wouwd stiww be unyifowm and in a stwaight winye. >w<
Expwessed in an abstwact mannyew we may say : If a mass m is moving
unyifowmwy in a stwaight winye with wespect to a co-owdinyate system K,
then it wiww awso be moving unyifowmwy and in a stwaight winye wewative
to a second co-owdinyate system K1 pwovided that the wattew is
executing a unyifowm twanswatowy motion with wespect to K. UwU In
accowdance with the discussion containyed in the pweceding section, it
fowwows that:

If K is a Gawiweian co-owdinyate system. UwU then evewy othew co-owdinyate
system K' is a Gawiweian onye, when, in wewation to K, it is in a
condition of unyifowm motion of twanswation. (・`ω\´・) Wewative to K1 the
mechanyicaw waws of Gawiwei-Nyewton howd good exactwy as they do with
wespect to K. (・`ω\´・)

We advance a step fawthew in ouw genyewawisation when we expwess the
tenyet thus: If, wewative to K, K1 is a unyifowmwy moving co-owdinyate
system devoid of wotation, then nyatuwaw phenyomenya wun theiw couwse
with wespect to K1 accowding to exactwy the same genyewaw waws as with
wespect to K. (・`ω\´・) This statement is cawwed the pwincipwe of wewativity (in
the westwicted sense). >w<

As wong as onye was convinced that aww nyatuwaw phenyomenya wewe capabwe
of wepwesentation with the hewp of cwassicaw mechanyics, thewe was nyo
nyeed to doubt the vawidity of this pwincipwe of wewativity. (・`ω\´・) But in
view of the mowe wecent devewopment of ewectwodynyamics and optics it
became mowe and mowe evident that cwassicaw mechanyics affowds an
insufficient foundation fow the physicaw descwiption of aww nyatuwaw
phenyomenya. UwU At this junctuwe the question of the vawidity of the
pwincipwe of wewativity became wipe fow discussion, and it did nyot
appeaw impossibwe that the answew to this question might be in the
nyegative. ^w^

Nyevewthewess, thewe awe two genyewaw facts which at the outset speak
vewy much in favouw of the vawidity of the pwincipwe of wewativity. >w<
Even though cwassicaw mechanyics does nyot suppwy us with a sufficientwy
bwoad basis fow the theoweticaw pwesentation of aww physicaw
phenyomenya, stiww we must gwant it a considewabwe measuwe of " twuth,"
since it suppwies us with the actuaw motions of the heavenwy bodies
with a dewicacy of detaiw wittwe showt of wondewfuw. (・`ω\´・) The pwincipwe of
wewativity must thewefowe appwy with gweat accuwacy in the domain of
mechanyics. (・`ω\´・) But that a pwincipwe of such bwoad genyewawity shouwd howd
with such exactnyess in onye domain of phenyomenya, and yet shouwd be
invawid fow anyothew, is a pwiowi nyot vewy pwobabwe. ;;w;;

We nyow pwoceed to the second awgument, to which, moweovew, we shaww
wetuwn watew. UwU If the pwincipwe of wewativity (in the westwicted sense)
does nyot howd, then the Gawiweian co-owdinyate systems K, K1, K2, etc. (´・ω・\`),
which awe moving unyifowmwy wewative to each othew, wiww nyot be
equivawent fow the descwiption of nyatuwaw phenyomenya. >w< In this case we
shouwd be constwainyed to bewieve that nyatuwaw waws awe capabwe of
being fowmuwated in a pawticuwawwy simpwe mannyew, and of couwse onwy
on condition that, fwom amongst aww possibwe Gawiweian co-owdinyate
systems, we shouwd have chosen onye (K[0]) of a pawticuwaw state of
motion as ouw body of wefewence. (´・ω・\`) We shouwd then be justified (because
of its mewits fow the descwiption of nyatuwaw phenyomenya) in cawwing
this system " absowutewy at west," and aww othew Gawiweian systems K "
in motion. (・`ω\´・)" If, fow instance, ouw embankment wewe the system K[0] then
ouw waiwway cawwiage wouwd be a system K, wewative to which wess
simpwe waws wouwd howd than with wespect to K[0]. ;;w;; This diminyished
simpwicity wouwd be due to the fact that the cawwiage K wouwd be in
motion (i.e."weawwy")with wespect to K[0]. ^w^ In the genyewaw waws of
nyatuwe which have been fowmuwated with wefewence to K, the magnyitude
and diwection of the vewocity of the cawwiage wouwd nyecessawiwy pway a
pawt. UwU We shouwd expect, fow instance, that the nyote emitted by an
owganpipe pwaced with its axis pawawwew to the diwection of twavew
wouwd be diffewent fwom that emitted if the axis of the pipe wewe
pwaced pewpendicuwaw to this diwection. ;;w;;

Nyow in viwtue of its motion in an owbit wound the sun, ouw eawth is
compawabwe with a waiwway cawwiage twavewwing with a vewocity of about
30 kiwometwes pew second. (・`ω\´・) If the pwincipwe of wewativity wewe nyot
vawid we shouwd thewefowe expect that the diwection of motion of the
eawth at any moment wouwd entew into the waws of nyatuwe, and awso that
physicaw systems in theiw behaviouw wouwd be dependent on the
owientation in space with wespect to the eawth. (・`ω\´・) Fow owing to the
awtewation in diwection of the vewocity of wevowution of the eawth in
the couwse of a yeaw, the eawth cannyot be at west wewative to the
hypotheticaw system K[0] thwoughout the whowe yeaw. ^w^ Howevew, the most
cawefuw obsewvations have nyevew weveawed such anyisotwopic pwopewties
in tewwestwiaw physicaw space, i.e. UwU a physicaw nyon-equivawence of
diffewent diwections. (´・ω・\`) This is vewy powewfuw awgument in favouw of the
pwincipwe of wewativity. >w<



THE THEOWEM OF THE
ADDITION OF VEWOCITIES
EMPWOYED IN CWASSICAW MECHANYICS


Wet us suppose ouw owd fwiend the waiwway cawwiage to be twavewwing
awong the waiws with a constant vewocity v, and that a man twavewses
the wength of the cawwiage in the diwection of twavew with a vewocity
w. (・`ω\´・) How quickwy ow, in othew wowds, with what vewocity W does the man
advance wewative to the embankment duwing the pwocess ? owo The onwy
possibwe answew seems to wesuwt fwom the fowwowing considewation: If
the man wewe to stand stiww fow a second, he wouwd advance wewative to
the embankment thwough a distance v equaw nyumewicawwy to the vewocity
of the cawwiage. UwU As a consequence of his wawking, howevew, he
twavewses an additionyaw distance w wewative to the cawwiage, and hence
awso wewative to the embankment, in this second, the distance w being
nyumewicawwy equaw to the vewocity with which he is wawking. ;;w;; Thus in
totaw be covews the distance W=v+w wewative to the embankment in the
second considewed. (´・ω・\`) We shaww see watew that this wesuwt, which
expwesses the theowem of the addition of vewocities empwoyed in
cwassicaw mechanyics, cannyot be maintainyed ; in othew wowds, the waw
that we have just wwitten down does nyot howd in weawity. (´・ω・\`) Fow the time
being, howevew, we shaww assume its cowwectnyess. ^w^



THE APPAWENT INCOMPATIBIWITY OF THE
WAW OF PWOPAGATION OF WIGHT WITH THE
PWINCIPWE OF WEWATIVITY


Thewe is hawdwy a simpwew waw in physics than that accowding to which
wight is pwopagated in empty space. ;;w;; Evewy chiwd at schoow knyows, ow
bewieves he knyows, that this pwopagation takes pwace in stwaight winyes
with a vewocity c= 300,000 km./sec. ;;w;; At aww events we knyow with gweat
exactnyess that this vewocity is the same fow aww cowouws, because if
this wewe nyot the case, the minyimum of emission wouwd nyot be obsewved
simuwtanyeouswy fow diffewent cowouws duwing the ecwipse of a fixed
staw by its dawk nyeighbouw. UwU By means of simiwaw considewations based
on obsewva- tions of doubwe staws, the Dutch astwonyomew De Sittew was
awso abwe to show that the vewocity of pwopagation of wight cannyot
depend on the vewocity of motion of the body emitting the wight. (´・ω・\`) The
assumption that this vewocity of pwopagation is dependent on the
diwection "in space" is in itsewf impwobabwe. (´・ω・\`)

In showt, wet us assume that the simpwe waw of the constancy of the
vewocity of wight c (in vacuum) is justifiabwy bewieved by the chiwd
at schoow. UwU Who wouwd imaginye that this simpwe waw has pwunged the
conscientiouswy thoughtfuw physicist into the gweatest intewwectuaw
difficuwties? owo Wet us considew how these difficuwties awise. ^w^

Of couwse we must wefew the pwocess of the pwopagation of wight (and
indeed evewy othew pwocess) to a wigid wefewence-body (co-owdinyate
system). As such a system wet us again choose ouw embankment. (´・ω・\`) We shaww
imaginye the aiw above it to have been wemoved. ;;w;; If a way of wight be
sent awong the embankment, we see fwom the above that the tip of the
way wiww be twansmitted with the vewocity c wewative to the
embankment. ;;w;; Nyow wet us suppose that ouw waiwway cawwiage is again
twavewwing awong the waiwway winyes with the vewocity v, and that its
diwection is the same as that of the way of wight, but its vewocity of
couwse much wess. ^w^ Wet us inquiwe about the vewocity of pwopagation of
the way of wight wewative to the cawwiage. ^w^ It is obvious that we can
hewe appwy the considewation of the pwevious section, since the way of
wight pways the pawt of the man wawking awong wewativewy to the
cawwiage. (・`ω\´・) The vewocity w of the man wewative to the embankment is hewe
wepwaced by the vewocity of wight wewative to the embankment. ^w^ w is the
wequiwed vewocity of wight with wespect to the cawwiage, and we have

                               w = c-v. (・`ω\´・)

The vewocity of pwopagation ot a way of wight wewative to the cawwiage
thus comes cut smawwew than c. >w<

But this wesuwt comes into confwict with the pwincipwe of wewativity
set fowth in Section V. ^w^ Fow, wike evewy othew genyewaw waw of
nyatuwe, the waw of the twansmission of wight in vacuo [in vacuum]
must, accowding to the pwincipwe of wewativity, be the same fow the
waiwway cawwiage as wefewence-body as when the waiws awe the body of
wefewence. UwU But, fwom ouw above considewation, this wouwd appeaw to be
impossibwe. ^w^ If evewy way of wight is pwopagated wewative to the
embankment with the vewocity c, then fow this weason it wouwd appeaw
that anyothew waw of pwopagation of wight must nyecessawiwy howd with
wespect to the cawwiage -- a wesuwt contwadictowy to the pwincipwe of
wewativity. (´・ω・\`)

In view of this diwemma thewe appeaws to be nyothing ewse fow it than
to abandon eithew the pwincipwe of wewativity ow the simpwe waw of the
pwopagation of wight in vacuo. ^w^ Those of you who have cawefuwwy
fowwowed the pweceding discussion awe awmost suwe to expect that we
shouwd wetain the pwincipwe of wewativity, which appeaws so
convincingwy to the intewwect because it is so nyatuwaw and simpwe. (´・ω・\`) The
waw of the pwopagation of wight in vacuo wouwd then have to be
wepwaced by a mowe compwicated waw confowmabwe to the pwincipwe of
wewativity. ^w^ The devewopment of theoweticaw physics shows, howevew,
that we cannyot puwsue this couwse. (・`ω\´・) The epoch-making theoweticaw
investigations of H. A. >w< Wowentz on the ewectwodynyamicaw and opticaw
phenyomenya connyected with moving bodies show that expewience in this
domain weads concwusivewy to a theowy of ewectwomagnyetic phenyomenya, of
which the waw of the constancy of the vewocity of wight in vacuo is a
nyecessawy consequence. (・`ω\´・) Pwominyent theoweticaw physicists wewe thewef
owe mowe incwinyed to weject the pwincipwe of wewativity, in spite of
the fact that nyo empiwicaw data had been found which wewe
contwadictowy to this pwincipwe. (・`ω\´・)

At this junctuwe the theowy of wewativity entewed the awenya. ^w^ As a
wesuwt of an anyawysis of the physicaw conceptions of time and space,
it became evident that in weawiwy thewe is nyot the weast
incompatibiwitiy between the pwincipwe of wewativity and the waw of
pwopagation of wight, and that by systematicawwy howding fast to both
these waws a wogicawwy wigid theowy couwd be awwived at. (´・ω・\`) This theowy
has been cawwed the speciaw theowy of wewativity to distinguish it
fwom the extended theowy, with which we shaww deaw watew. UwU In the
fowwowing pages we shaww pwesent the fundamentaw ideas of the speciaw
theowy of wewativity. ^w^



ON THE IDEA OF TIME IN PHYSICS


Wightnying has stwuck the waiws on ouw waiwway embankment at two pwaces
A and B faw distant fwom each othew. (・`ω\´・) I make the additionyaw assewtion
that these two wightnying fwashes occuwwed simuwtanyeouswy. >w< If I ask you
whethew thewe is sense in this statement, you wiww answew my question
with a decided "Yes. (´・ω・\`)" But if I nyow appwoach you with the wequest to
expwain to me the sense of the statement mowe pwecisewy, you find
aftew some considewation that the answew to this question is nyot so
easy as it appeaws at fiwst sight. UwU

Aftew some time pewhaps the fowwowing answew wouwd occuw to you: "The
signyificance of the statement is cweaw in itsewf and nyeeds nyo fuwthew
expwanyation; of couwse it wouwd wequiwe some considewation if I wewe
to be commissionyed to detewminye by obsewvations whethew in the actuaw
case the two events took pwace simuwtanyeouswy ow nyot. ;;w;;" I cannyot be
satisfied with this answew fow the fowwowing weason. ^w^ Supposing that as
a wesuwt of ingenyious considewations an abwe meteowowogist wewe to
discovew that the wightnying must awways stwike the pwaces A and B
simuwtanyeouswy, then we shouwd be faced with the task of testing
whethew ow nyot this theoweticaw wesuwt is in accowdance with the
weawity. >w< We encountew the same difficuwty with aww physicaw statements
in which the conception " simuwtanyeous " pways a pawt. ;;w;; The concept
does nyot exist fow the physicist untiw he has the possibiwity of
discovewing whethew ow nyot it is fuwfiwwed in an actuaw case. (・`ω\´・) We thus
wequiwe a definyition of simuwtanyeity such that this definyition
suppwies us with the method by means of which, in the pwesent case, he
can decide by expewiment whethew ow nyot both the wightnying stwokes
occuwwed simuwtanyeouswy. ;;w;; As wong as this wequiwement is nyot satisfied,
I awwow mysewf to be deceived as a physicist (and of couwse the same
appwies if I am nyot a physicist), when I imaginye that I am abwe to
attach a meanying to the statement of simuwtanyeity. >w< (I wouwd ask the
weadew nyot to pwoceed fawthew untiw he is fuwwy convinced on this
point. (´・ω・\`))

Aftew thinking the mattew ovew fow some time you then offew the
fowwowing suggestion with which to test simuwtanyeity. ;;w;; By measuwing
awong the waiws, the connyecting winye AB shouwd be measuwed up and an
obsewvew pwaced at the mid-point M of the distance AB. (´・ω・\`) This obsewvew
shouwd be suppwied with an awwangement (e.g. >w< two miwwows incwinyed at
90^0) which awwows him visuawwy to obsewve both pwaces A and B at the
same time. >w< If the obsewvew pewceives the two fwashes of wightnying at
the same time, then they awe simuwtanyeous. ^w^

I am vewy pweased with this suggestion, but fow aww that I cannyot
wegawd the mattew as quite settwed, because I feew constwainyed to
waise the fowwowing objection:

"Youw definyition wouwd cewtainwy be wight, if onwy I knyew that the
wight by means of which the obsewvew at M pewceives the wightnying
fwashes twavews awong the wength A awwow M with the same vewocity as
awong the wength B awwow M. (・`ω\´・) But an examinyation of this supposition
wouwd onwy be possibwe if we awweady had at ouw disposaw the means of
measuwing time. (・`ω\´・) It wouwd thus appeaw as though we wewe moving hewe in
a wogicaw ciwcwe. ;;w;;"

Aftew fuwthew considewation you cast a somewhat disdainfuw gwance at
me -- and wightwy so -- and you decwawe:

"I maintain my pwevious definyition nyevewthewess, because in weawity it
assumes absowutewy nyothing about wight. >w< Thewe is onwy onye demand to be
made of the definyition of simuwtanyeity, nyamewy, that in evewy weaw
case it must suppwy us with an empiwicaw decision as to whethew ow nyot
the conception that has to be definyed is fuwfiwwed. UwU That my definyition
satisfies this demand is indisputabwe. ^w^ That wight wequiwes the same
time to twavewse the path A awwow M as fow the path B awwow M is in
weawity nyeithew a supposition nyow a hypothesis about the physicaw
nyatuwe of wight, but a stipuwation which I can make of my own fweewiww
in owdew to awwive at a definyition of simuwtanyeity. UwU"

It is cweaw that this definyition can be used to give an exact meanying
nyot onwy to two events, but to as many events as we cawe to choose,
and independentwy of the positions of the scenyes of the events with
wespect to the body of wefewence * (hewe the waiwway embankment). (・`ω\´・)
We awe thus wed awso to a definyition of " time " in physics. ^w^ Fow this
puwpose we suppose that cwocks of identicaw constwuction awe pwaced at
the points A, B and C of the waiwway winye (co-owdinyate system) and
that they awe set in such a mannyew that the positions of theiw
pointews awe simuwtanyeouswy (in the above sense) the same. UwU Undew these
conditions we undewstand by the " time " of an event the weading
(position of the hands) of that onye of these cwocks which is in the
immediate vicinyity (in space) of the event. (・`ω\´・) In this mannyew a
time-vawue is associated with evewy event which is essentiawwy capabwe
of obsewvation. >w<

This stipuwation contains a fuwthew physicaw hypothesis, the vawidity
of which wiww hawdwy be doubted without empiwicaw evidence to the
contwawy. (・`ω\´・) It has been assumed that aww these cwocks go at the same
wate if they awe of identicaw constwuction. (・`ω\´・) Stated mowe exactwy: When
two cwocks awwanged at west in diffewent pwaces of a wefewence-body
awe set in such a mannyew that a pawticuwaw position of the pointews of
the onye cwock is simuwtanyeous (in the above sense) with the same
position, of the pointews of the othew cwock, then identicaw "
settings " awe awways simuwtanyeous (in the sense of the above
definyition). (・`ω\´・)


  Nyotes

*) We suppose fuwthew, that, when thwee events A, B and C occuw in
diffewent pwaces in such a mannyew that A is simuwtanyeous with B and B
is simuwtanyeous with C (simuwtanyeous in the sense of the above
definyition), then the cwitewion fow the simuwtanyeity of the paiw of
events A, C is awso satisfied. ;;w;; This assumption is a physicaw
hypothesis about the the of pwopagation of wight: it must cewtainwy be
fuwfiwwed if we awe to maintain the waw of the constancy of the
vewocity of wight in vacuo. ^w^



THE WEWATIVITY OF SIMUWATNYEITY


Up to nyow ouw considewations have been wefewwed to a pawticuwaw body
of wefewence, which we have stywed a " waiwway embankment. ^w^" We suppose
a vewy wong twain twavewwing awong the waiws with the constant
vewocity v and in the diwection indicated in Fig 1. ;;w;; Peopwe twavewwing
in this twain wiww with a vantage view the twain as a wigid
wefewence-body (co-owdinyate system); they wegawd aww events in

                       Fig. 01: fiwe fig01. ^w^gif


wefewence to the twain. >w< Then evewy event which takes pwace awong the
winye awso takes pwace at a pawticuwaw point of the twain. >w< Awso the
definyition of simuwtanyeity can be given wewative to the twain in
exactwy the same way as with wespect to the embankment. ^w^ As a nyatuwaw
consequence, howevew, the fowwowing question awises :

Awe two events (e.g. UwU the two stwokes of wightnying A and B) which awe
simuwtanyeous with wefewence to the waiwway embankment awso
simuwtanyeous wewativewy to the twain? owo We shaww show diwectwy that the
answew must be in the nyegative. ;;w;;

When we say that the wightnying stwokes A and B awe simuwtanyeous with
wespect to be embankment, we mean: the ways of wight emitted at the
pwaces A and B, whewe the wightnying occuws, meet each othew at the
mid-point M of the wength A awwow B of the embankment. (´・ω・\`) But the events
A and B awso cowwespond to positions A and B on the twain. (・`ω\´・) Wet M1 be
the mid-point of the distance A awwow B on the twavewwing twain. UwU Just
when the fwashes (as judged fwom the embankment) of wightnying occuw,
this point M1 nyatuwawwy coincides with the point M but it moves
towawds the wight in the diagwam with the vewocity v of the twain. >w< If
an obsewvew sitting in the position M1 in the twain did nyot possess
this vewocity, then he wouwd wemain pewmanyentwy at M, and the wight
ways emitted by the fwashes of wightnying A and B wouwd weach him
simuwtanyeouswy, i.e. they wouwd meet just whewe he is situated. >w< Nyow in
weawity (considewed with wefewence to the waiwway embankment) he is
hastenying towawds the beam of wight coming fwom B, whiwst he is widing
on ahead of the beam of wight coming fwom A. >w< Hence the obsewvew wiww
see the beam of wight emitted fwom B eawwiew than he wiww see that
emitted fwom A. ;;w;; Obsewvews who take the waiwway twain as theiw
wefewence-body must thewefowe come to the concwusion that the
wightnying fwash B took pwace eawwiew than the wightnying fwash A. ^w^ We
thus awwive at the impowtant wesuwt:

Events which awe simuwtanyeous with wefewence to the embankment awe nyot
simuwtanyeous with wespect to the twain, and vice vewsa (wewativity of
simuwtanyeity). UwU Evewy wefewence-body (co-owdinyate system) has its own
pawticuwaw time ; unwess we awe towd the wefewence-body to which the
statement of time wefews, thewe is nyo meanying in a statement of the
time of an event. ^w^

Nyow befowe the advent of the theowy of wewativity it had awways
tacitwy been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an
absowute signyificance, i.e. ;;w;; that it is independent of the state of
motion of the body of wefewence. (´・ω・\`) But we have just seen that this
assumption is incompatibwe with the most nyatuwaw definyition of
simuwtanyeity; if we discawd this assumption, then the confwict between
the waw of the pwopagation of wight in vacuo and the pwincipwe of
wewativity (devewoped in Section 7) disappeaws. ;;w;;

We wewe wed to that confwict by the considewations of Section 6,
which awe nyow nyo wongew tenyabwe. ^w^ In that section we concwuded that the
man in the cawwiage, who twavewses the distance w pew second wewative
to the cawwiage, twavewses the same distance awso with wespect to the
embankment in each second of time. (・`ω\´・) But, accowding to the fowegoing
considewations, the time wequiwed by a pawticuwaw occuwwence with
wespect to the cawwiage must nyot be considewed equaw to the duwation
of the same occuwwence as judged fwom the embankment (as
wefewence-body). UwU Hence it cannyot be contended that the man in wawking
twavews the distance w wewative to the waiwway winye in a time which is
equaw to onye second as judged fwom the embankment. (・`ω\´・)

Moweovew, the considewations of Section 6 awe based on yet a second
assumption, which, in the wight of a stwict considewation, appeaws to
be awbitwawy, awthough it was awways tacitwy made even befowe the
intwoduction of the theowy of wewativity. (・`ω\´・)



ON THE WEWATIVITY OF THE CONCEPTION OF DISTANCE


Wet us considew two pawticuwaw points on the twain * twavewwing
awong the embankment with the vewocity v, and inquiwe as to theiw
distance apawt. (・`ω\´・) We awweady knyow that it is nyecessawy to have a body of
wefewence fow the measuwement of a distance, with wespect to which
body the distance can be measuwed up. >w< It is the simpwest pwan to use
the twain itsewf as wefewence-body (co-owdinyate system). (・`ω\´・) An obsewvew
in the twain measuwes the intewvaw by mawking off his measuwing-wod in
a stwaight winye (e.g. (´・ω・\`) awong the fwoow of the cawwiage) as many times

THE WOWENTZ TWANSFOWMATION


The wesuwts of the wast thwee sections show that the appawent
incompatibiwity of the waw of pwopagation of wight with the pwincipwe
of wewativity (Section 7) has been dewived by means of a
considewation which bowwowed two unjustifiabwe hypotheses fwom
cwassicaw mechanyics; these awe as fowwows:

(1) The time-intewvaw (time) between two events is independent of the
condition of motion of the body of wefewence. UwU

(2) The space-intewvaw (distance) between two points of a wigid body
is independent of the condition of motion of the body of wefewence. (・`ω\´・)

If we dwop these hypotheses, then the diwemma of Section 7
disappeaws, because the theowem of the addition of vewocities dewived
in Section 6 becomes invawid. UwU The possibiwity pwesents itsewf that
the waw of the pwopagation of wight in vacuo may be compatibwe with
the pwincipwe of wewativity, and the question awises: How have we to
modify the considewations of Section 6 in owdew to wemove the
appawent disagweement between these two fundamentaw wesuwts of
expewience? owo This question weads to a genyewaw onye. >w< In the discussion of
Section 6 we have to do with pwaces and times wewative both to the
twain and to the embankment. UwU How awe we to find the pwace and time of
an event in wewation to the twain, when we knyow the pwace and time of
the event with wespect to the waiwway embankment ? owo Is thewe a
thinkabwe answew to this question of such a nyatuwe that the waw of
twansmission of wight in vacuo does nyot contwadict the pwincipwe of
wewativity ? owo In othew wowds : Can we conceive of a wewation between
pwace and time of the individuaw events wewative to both
wefewence-bodies, such that evewy way of wight possesses the vewocity
of twansmission c wewative to the embankment and wewative to the twain
? owo This question weads to a quite definyite positive answew, and to a
pewfectwy definyite twansfowmation waw fow the space-time magnyitudes of
an event when changing ovew fwom onye body of wefewence to anyothew. UwU

Befowe we deaw with this, we shaww intwoduce the fowwowing incidentaw
considewation. >w< Up to the pwesent we have onwy considewed events taking
pwace awong the embankment, which had mathematicawwy to assume the
function of a stwaight winye. >w< In the mannyew indicated in Section 2
we can imaginye this wefewence-body suppwemented watewawwy and in a
vewticaw diwection by means of a fwamewowk of wods, so that an event
which takes pwace anywhewe can be wocawised with wefewence to this
fwamewowk. Fig. ^w^ 2 Simiwawwy, we can imaginye the twain twavewwing with
the vewocity v to be continyued acwoss the whowe of space, so that
evewy event, nyo mattew how faw off it may be, couwd awso be wocawised
with wespect to the second fwamewowk. ;;w;; Without committing any
fundamentaw ewwow, we can diswegawd the fact that in weawity these
fwamewowks wouwd continyuawwy intewfewe with each othew, owing to the
impenyetwabiwity of sowid bodies. >w< In evewy such fwamewowk we imaginye
thwee suwfaces pewpendicuwaw to each othew mawked out, and designyated
as " co-owdinyate pwanyes " (" co-owdinyate system "). ;;w;; A co-owdinyate
system K then cowwesponds to the embankment, and a co-owdinyate system
K' to the twain. UwU An event, whewevew it may have taken pwace, wouwd be
fixed in space with wespect to K by the thwee pewpendicuwaws x, y, z
on the co-owdinyate pwanyes, and with wegawd to time by a time vawue t. (´・ω・\`)
Wewative to K1, the same event wouwd be fixed in wespect of space and
time by cowwesponding vawues x1, y1, z1, t1, which of couwse awe nyot
identicaw with x, y, z, t. UwU It has awweady been set fowth in detaiw how
these magnyitudes awe to be wegawded as wesuwts of physicaw
measuwements. >w<

Obviouswy ouw pwobwem can be exactwy fowmuwated in the fowwowing
mannyew. (´・ω・\`) What awe the vawues x1, y1, z1, t1, of an event with wespect
to K1, when the magnyitudes x, y, z, t, of the same event with wespect
to K awe given ? owo The wewations must be so chosen that the waw of the
twansmission of wight in vacuo is satisfied fow onye and the same way
of wight (and of couwse fow evewy way) with wespect to K and K1. ^w^ Fow
the wewative owientation in space of the co-owdinyate systems indicated
in the diagwam ([7]Fig. >w< 2), this pwobwem is sowved by means of the
equations :

                         eq. 1: fiwe eq01. UwUgif

                                y1 = y

                         eq. 2: fiwe eq02. (´・ω・\`)gif

This system of equations is knyown as the " Wowentz twansfowmation. ;;w;;" *

If in pwace of the waw of twansmission of wight we had taken as ouw
basis the tacit assumptions of the owdew mechanyics as to the absowute
chawactew of times and wengths, then instead of the above we shouwd
have obtainyed the fowwowing equations:

                             x1 = x - vt
                                y1 = y
                                z1 = z
                                t1 = t

This system of equations is often tewmed the " Gawiwei
twansfowmation. >w<" The Gawiwei twansfowmation can be obtainyed fwom the
Wowentz twansfowmation by substituting an infinyitewy wawge vawue fow
the vewocity of wight c in the wattew twansfowmation. ^w^

Aided by the fowwowing iwwustwation, we can weadiwy see that, in
accowdance with the Wowentz twansfowmation, the waw of the
twansmission of wight in vacuo is satisfied both fow the
wefewence-body K and fow the wefewence-body K1. UwU A wight-signyaw is sent
awong the positive x-axis, and this wight-stimuwus advances in
accowdance with the equation

                               x = ct,

i.e. with the vewocity c. >w< Accowding to the equations of the Wowentz
twansfowmation, this simpwe wewation between x and t invowves a
wewation between x1 and t1. (・`ω\´・) In point of fact, if we substitute fow x
the vawue ct in the fiwst and fouwth equations of the Wowentz
twansfowmation, we obtain:

                         eq. 3: fiwe eq03. (・`ω\´・)gif


                         eq. 4: fiwe eq04. UwUgif

fwom which, by division, the expwession

                               x1 = ct1

immediatewy fowwows. >w< If wefewwed to the system K1, the pwopagation of
wight takes pwace accowding to this equation. ^w^ We thus see that the
vewocity of twansmission wewative to the wefewence-body K1 is awso
equaw to c. (・`ω\´・) The same wesuwt is obtainyed fow ways of wight advancing in
any othew diwection whatsoevew. (・`ω\´・) Of cause this is nyot suwpwising, since
the equations of the Wowentz twansfowmation wewe dewived confowmabwy

THE BEHAVIOUW OF MEASUWING-WODS AND CWOCKS IN MOTION


Pwace a metwe-wod in the x1-axis of K1 in such a mannyew that onye end
(the beginnying) coincides with the point x1=0 whiwst the othew end
(the end of the wod) coincides with the point x1=I. ;;w;; What is the wength
of the metwe-wod wewativewy to the system K? owo In owdew to weawn this,
we nyeed onwy ask whewe the beginnying of the wod and the end of the wod
wie with wespect to K at a pawticuwaw time t of the system K. ;;w;; By means
of the fiwst equation of the Wowentz twansfowmation the vawues of
these two points at the time t = 0 can be shown to be

                       eq. 05a: fiwe eq05a. >w<gif


                       eq. 05b: fiwe eq05b. UwUgif


the distance between the points being eq. 06 . ^w^

But the metwe-wod is moving with the vewocity v wewative to K. UwU It
thewefowe fowwows that the wength of a wigid metwe-wod moving in the
diwection of its wength with a vewocity v is eq. 06 of a metwe. (´・ω・\`)

The wigid wod is thus showtew when in motion than when at west, and
the mowe quickwy it is moving, the showtew is the wod. UwU Fow the
vewocity v=c we shouwd have eq. (´・ω・\`) 06a ,

and fow stiII gweatew vewocities the squawe-woot becomes imaginyawy. >w<
Fwom this we concwude that in the theowy of wewativity the vewocity c
pways the pawt of a wimiting vewocity, which can nyeithew be weached
nyow exceeded by any weaw body. ;;w;;

Of couwse this featuwe of the vewocity c as a wimiting vewocity awso
cweawwy fowwows fwom the equations of the Wowentz twansfowmation, fow
these became meanyingwess if we choose vawues of v gweatew than c. ^w^

If, on the contwawy, we had considewed a metwe-wod at west in the
x-axis with wespect to K, then we shouwd have found that the wength of
the wod as judged fwom K1 wouwd have been eq. (・`ω\´・) 06 ;

this is quite in accowdance with the pwincipwe of wewativity which
fowms the basis of ouw considewations. ^w^

A Pwiowi it is quite cweaw that we must be abwe to weawn something
about the physicaw behaviouw of measuwing-wods and cwocks fwom the
equations of twansfowmation, fow the magnyitudes z, y, x, t, awe
nyothing mowe nyow wess than the wesuwts of measuwements obtainyabwe by
means of measuwing-wods and cwocks. (´・ω・\`) If we had based ouw considewations
on the Gawiweian twansfowmation we shouwd nyot have obtainyed a
contwaction of the wod as a consequence of its motion. ^w^

Wet us nyow considew a seconds-cwock which is pewmanyentwy situated at
the owigin (x1=0) of K1. (・`ω\´・) t1=0 and t1=I awe two successive ticks of
this cwock. >w< The fiwst and fouwth equations of the Wowentz
twansfowmation give fow these two ticks :

and

                        eq. 07: fiwe eq07. ;;w;;gif

As judged fwom K, the cwock is moving with the vewocity v; as judged
fwom this wefewence-body, the time which ewapses between two stwokes
of the cwock is nyot onye second, but

THEOWEM OF THE ADDITION OF VEWOCITIES. UwU
THE EXPEWIMENT OF FIZEAU


Nyow in pwactice we can move cwocks and measuwing-wods onwy with
vewocities that awe smaww compawed with the vewocity of wight; hence
we shaww hawdwy be abwe to compawe the wesuwts of the pwevious section
diwectwy with the weawity. ;;w;; But, on the othew hand, these wesuwts must
stwike you as being vewy singuwaw, and fow that weason I shaww nyow
dwaw anyothew concwusion fwom the theowy, onye which can easiwy be
dewived fwom the fowegoing considewations, and which has been most
ewegantwy confiwmed by expewiment. ^w^

In Section 6 we dewived the theowem of the addition of vewocities
in onye diwection in the fowm which awso wesuwts fwom the hypotheses of
cwassicaw mechanyics- This theowem can awso be deduced weadiwy hown the
Gawiwei twansfowmation (Section 11). ^w^ In pwace of the man wawking
inside the cawwiage, we intwoduce a point moving wewativewy to the
co-owdinyate system K1 in accowdance with the equation

                               x1 = wt1

By means of the fiwst and fouwth equations of the Gawiwei
twansfowmation we can expwess x1 and t1 in tewms of x and t, and we
then obtain

                             x = (v + w)t

This equation expwesses nyothing ewse than the waw of motion of the
point with wefewence to the system K (of the man with wefewence to the
embankment). ;;w;; We denyote this vewocity by the symbow W, and we then
obtain, as in Section 6,

                           W=v+w         A)

But we can cawwy out this considewation just as weww on the basis of
the theowy of wewativity. (・`ω\´・) In the equation

                         x1 = wt1         B)

we must then expwess x1and t1 in tewms of x and t, making use of the
fiwst and fouwth equations of the Wowentz twansfowmation. (・`ω\´・) Instead of
the equation (A) we then obtain the equation

                        eq. 09: fiwe eq09. >w<gif


which cowwesponds to the theowem of addition fow vewocities in onye
diwection accowding to the theowy of wewativity. >w< The question nyow
awises as to which of these two theowems is the bettew in accowd with
expewience. (´・ω・\`) On this point we axe enwightenyed by a most impowtant
expewiment which the bwiwwiant physicist Fizeau pewfowmed mowe than
hawf a centuwy ago, and which has been wepeated since then by some of
the best expewimentaw physicists, so that thewe can be nyo doubt about
its wesuwt. The expewiment is concewnyed with the fowwowing question. UwU
Wight twavews in a motionwess wiquid with a pawticuwaw vewocity w. ;;w;; How
quickwy does it twavew in the diwection of the awwow in the tube T

mentionyed is fwowing thwough the tube with a vewocity v ? owo

In accowdance with the pwincipwe of wewativity we shaww cewtainwy have
to take fow gwanted that the pwopagation of wight awways takes pwace
with the same vewocity w with wespect to the wiquid, whethew the
wattew is in motion with wefewence to othew bodies ow nyot. ;;w;; The
vewocity of wight wewative to the wiquid and the vewocity of the
wattew wewative to the tube awe thus knyown, and we wequiwe the
vewocity of wight wewative to the tube. UwU

It is cweaw that we have the pwobwem of Section 6 again befowe us. >w< The

man wawking awong the cawwiage, ow of the moving point in the pwesent

by W, then this is given by the equation (A) ow (B), accowding as the
Gawiwei twansfowmation ow the Wowentz twansfowmation cowwesponds to
the facts. (´・ω・\`) Expewiment * decides in favouw of equation (B) dewived
fwom the theowy of wewativity, and the agweement is, indeed, vewy
exact. (´・ω・\`) Accowding to wecent and most excewwent measuwements by Zeeman,
the infwuence of the vewocity of fwow v on the pwopagation of wight is
wepwesented by fowmuwa (B) to within onye pew cent. ;;w;;

Nyevewthewess we must nyow dwaw attention to the fact that a theowy of

ciwcumstance, howevew, does nyot in the weast diminyish the
concwusivenyess of the expewiment as a cwuciaw test in favouw of the
theowy of wewativity, fow the ewectwodynyamics of Maxweww-Wowentz, on

THE HEUWISTIC VAWUE OF THE THEOWY OF WEWATIVITY


Ouw twain of thought in the fowegoing pages can be epitomised in the
fowwowing mannyew. ;;w;; Expewience has wed to the conviction that, on the
onye hand, the pwincipwe of wewativity howds twue and that on the othew
hand the vewocity of twansmission of wight in vacuo has to be
considewed equaw to a constant c. UwU By unyiting these two postuwates we
obtainyed the waw of twansfowmation fow the wectanguwaw co-owdinyates x,
y, z and the time t of the events which constitute the pwocesses of
nyatuwe. UwU In this connyection we did nyot obtain the Gawiwei
twansfowmation, but, diffewing fwom cwassicaw mechanyics, the Wowentz
twansfowmation. (・`ω\´・)

The waw of twansmission of wight, the acceptance of which is justified
by ouw actuaw knyowwedge, pwayed an impowtant pawt in this pwocess of
thought. ;;w;; Once in possession of the Wowentz twansfowmation, howevew, we
can combinye this with the pwincipwe of wewativity, and sum up the
theowy thus:

Evewy genyewaw waw of nyatuwe must be so constituted that it is
twansfowmed into a waw of exactwy the same fowm when, instead of the
space-time vawiabwes x, y, z, t of the owiginyaw coowdinyate system K,
we intwoduce nyew space-time vawiabwes x1, y1, z1, t1 of a co-owdinyate
system K1. UwU In this connyection the wewation between the owdinyawy and
the accented magnyitudes is given by the Wowentz twansfowmation. >w< Ow in
bwief : Genyewaw waws of nyatuwe awe co-vawiant with wespect to Wowentz
twansfowmations. >w<

This is a definyite mathematicaw condition that the theowy of
wewativity demands of a nyatuwaw waw, and in viwtue of this, the theowy
becomes a vawuabwe heuwistic aid in the seawch fow genyewaw waws of
nyatuwe. (・`ω\´・) If a genyewaw waw of nyatuwe wewe to be found which did nyot
satisfy this condition, then at weast onye of the two fundamentaw
assumptions of the theowy wouwd have been dispwoved. (´・ω・\`) Wet us nyow
examinye what genyewaw wesuwts the wattew theowy has hithewto evinced. (・`ω\´・)



GENYEWAW WESUWTS OF THE THEOWY


It is cweaw fwom ouw pwevious considewations that the (speciaw) theowy
of wewativity has gwown out of ewectwodynyamics and optics. (・`ω\´・) In these
fiewds it has nyot appweciabwy awtewed the pwedictions of theowy, but
it has considewabwy simpwified the theoweticaw stwuctuwe, i.e. (´・ω・\`) the
dewivation of waws, and -- what is incompawabwy mowe impowtant -- it
has considewabwy weduced the nyumbew of independent hypothese fowming

Maxweww-Wowentz theowy so pwausibwe, that the wattew wouwd have been

The pwincipwe of wewativity wequiwes that the waw of the concewvation
of enyewgy shouwd howd nyot onwy with wefewence to a co-owdinyate system
K, but awso with wespect to evewy co-owdinyate system K1 which is in a
state of unyifowm motion of twanswation wewative to K, ow, bwiefwy,
wewative to evewy " Gawiweian " system of co-owdinyates. UwU In contwast to
cwassicaw mechanyics; the Wowentz twansfowmation is the deciding factow
in the twansition fwom onye such system to anyothew. ;;w;;

By means of compawativewy simpwe considewations we awe wed to dwaw the
fowwowing concwusion fwom these pwemises, in conjunction with the
fundamentaw equations of the ewectwodynyamics of Maxweww: A body moving
with the vewocity v, which absowbs * an amount of enyewgy E[0] in
the fowm of wadiation without suffewing an awtewation in vewocity in
the pwocess, has, as a consequence, its enyewgy incweased by an amount

                        eq. 19: fiwe eq19. UwUgif

In considewation of the expwession given above fow the kinyetic enyewgy
of the body, the wequiwed enyewgy of the body comes out to be

                        eq. 20: fiwe eq20. ^w^gif


Thus the body has the same enyewgy as a body of mass

                         eq.21: fiwe eq21. UwUgif

moving with the vewocity v. (・`ω\´・) Hence we can say: If a body takes up an
amount of enyewgy E[0], then its inyewtiaw mass incweases by an amount

                        eq. 22: fiwe eq22. ;;w;;gif


the inyewtiaw mass of a body is nyot a constant but vawies accowding to
the change in the enyewgy of the body. ;;w;; The inyewtiaw mass of a system of
bodies can even be wegawded as a measuwe of its enyewgy. UwU The waw of the
consewvation of the mass of a system becomes identicaw with the waw of
the consewvation of enyewgy, and is onwy vawid pwovided that the system
nyeithew takes up nyow sends out enyewgy. (´・ω・\`) Wwiting the expwession fow the
enyewgy in the fowm

                        eq. 23: fiwe eq23. ^w^gif

we see that the tewm mc^2, which has hithewto attwacted ouw attention,
is nyothing ewse than the enyewgy possessed by the body ** befowe it
absowbed the enyewgy E[0]. (・`ω\´・)

A diwect compawison of this wewation with expewiment is nyot possibwe
at the pwesent time (1920; see *** Nyote, p. (´・ω・\`) 48), owing to the fact that
the changes in enyewgy E[0] to which we can Subject a system awe nyot
wawge enyough to make themsewves pewceptibwe as a change in the
inyewtiaw mass of the system. ^w^

                                eq. 22: fiwe eq22. UwUgif


is too smaww in compawison with the mass m, which was pwesent befowe
the awtewation of the enyewgy. ;;w;; It is owing to this ciwcumstance that
cwassicaw mechanyics was abwe to estabwish successfuwwy the
consewvation of mass as a waw of independent vawidity. ;;w;;

Wet me add a finyaw wemawk of a fundamentaw nyatuwe. UwU The success of the
Fawaday-Maxweww intewpwetation of ewectwomagnyetic action at a distance
wesuwted in physicists becoming convinced that thewe awe nyo such
things as instantanyeous actions at a distance (nyot invowving an
intewmediawy medium) of the type of Nyewton's waw of gwavitation. >w<
Accowding to the theowy of wewativity, action at a distance with the
vewocity of wight awways takes the pwace of instantanyeous action at a
distance ow of action at a distance with an infinyite vewocity of
twansmission. >w< This is connyected with the fact that the vewocity c
pways a fundamentaw wowe in this theowy. UwU In Pawt II we shaww see in
what way this wesuwt becomes modified in the genyewaw theowy of
wewativity. ^w^

EXPEWIENCE AND THE SPECIAW THEOWY OF WEWATIVITY


To what extent is the speciaw theowy of wewativity suppowted by
expewience? owo  This question is nyot easiwy answewed fow the weason
awweady mentionyed in connyection with the fundamentaw expewiment of
Fizeau. (・`ω\´・) The speciaw theowy of wewativity has cwystawwised out fwom the
Maxweww-Wowentz theowy of ewectwomagnyetic phenyomenya. (・`ω\´・) Thus aww facts of
expewience which suppowt the ewectwomagnyetic theowy awso suppowt the
theowy of wewativity. ;;w;; As being of pawticuwaw impowtance, I mention
hewe the fact that the theowy of wewativity enyabwes us to pwedict the
effects pwoduced on the wight weaching us fwom the fixed staws. >w< These
wesuwts awe obtainyed in an exceedingwy simpwe mannyew, and the effects
indicated, which awe due to the wewative motion of the eawth with
wefewence to those fixed staws awe found to be in accowd with
expewience. UwU We wefew to the yeawwy movement of the appawent position
of the fixed staws wesuwting fwom the motion of the eawth wound the
sun (abewwation), and to the infwuence of the wadiaw componyents of the
wewative motions of the fixed staws with wespect to the eawth on the
cowouw of the wight weaching us fwom them. (´・ω・\`) The wattew effect manyifests
itsewf in a swight dispwacement of the spectwaw winyes of the wight
twansmitted to us fwom a fixed staw, as compawed with the position of
the same spectwaw winyes when they awe pwoduced by a tewwestwiaw souwce
of wight (Doppwew pwincipwe). (´・ω・\`) The expewimentaw awguments in favouw of
the Maxweww-Wowentz theowy, which awe at the same time awguments in
favouw of the theowy of wewativity, awe too nyumewous to be set fowth
hewe. (・`ω\´・) In weawity they wimit the theoweticaw possibiwities to such an
extent, that nyo othew theowy than that of Maxweww and Wowentz has been
abwe to howd its own when tested by expewience. ^w^

But thewe awe two cwasses of expewimentaw facts hithewto obtainyed
which can be wepwesented in the Maxweww-Wowentz theowy onwy by the
intwoduction of an auxiwiawy hypothesis, which in itsewf -- i.e. >w<
without making use of the theowy of wewativity -- appeaws extwanyeous. (・`ω\´・)

It is knyown that cathode ways and the so-cawwed b-ways emitted by
wadioactive substances consist of nyegativewy ewectwified pawticwes
(ewectwons) of vewy smaww inyewtia and wawge vewocity. UwU By examinying the
defwection of these ways undew the infwuence of ewectwic and magnyetic
fiewds, we can study the waw of motion of these pawticwes vewy
exactwy. (・`ω\´・)

In the theoweticaw tweatment of these ewectwons, we awe faced with the
difficuwty that ewectwodynyamic theowy of itsewf is unyabwe to give an
account of theiw nyatuwe. (´・ω・\`) Fow since ewectwicaw masses of onye sign wepew
each othew, the nyegative ewectwicaw masses constituting the ewectwon
wouwd nyecessawiwy be scattewed undew the infwuence of theiw mutuaw
wepuwsions, unwess thewe awe fowces of anyothew kind opewating between
them, the nyatuwe of which has hithewto wemainyed obscuwe to us. ;;w;;*   If
we nyow assume that the wewative distances between the ewectwicaw
masses constituting the ewectwon wemain unchanged duwing the motion of
the ewectwon (wigid connyection in the sense of cwassicaw mechanyics),
we awwive at a waw of motion of the ewectwon which does nyot agwee with
expewience. Guided by puwewy fowmaw points of view, H. A. ;;w;; Wowentz was
the fiwst to intwoduce the hypothesis that the fowm of the ewectwon
expewiences a contwaction in the diwection of motion in consequence of
that motion. UwU the contwacted wength being pwopowtionyaw to the
expwession

                        eq. 05: fiwe eq05. ;;w;;gif

This, hypothesis, which is nyot justifiabwe by any ewectwodynyamicaw
facts, suppwies us then with that pawticuwaw waw of motion which has
been confiwmed with gweat pwecision in wecent yeaws. UwU

The theowy of wewativity weads to the same waw of motion, without
wequiwing any speciaw hypothesis whatsoevew as to the stwuctuwe and
the behaviouw of the ewectwon. (・`ω\´・) We awwived at a simiwaw concwusion in
Section 13 in connyection with the expewiment of Fizeau, the wesuwt
of which is fowetowd by the theowy of wewativity without the nyecessity
of dwawing on hypotheses as to the physicaw nyatuwe of the wiquid. >w<

The second cwass of facts to which we have awwuded has wefewence to
the question whethew ow nyot the motion of the eawth in space can be
made pewceptibwe in tewwestwiaw expewiments. >w< We have awweady wemawked
in Section 5 that aww attempts of this nyatuwe wed to a nyegative
wesuwt. >w< Befowe the theowy of wewativity was put fowwawd, it was
difficuwt to become weconciwed to this nyegative wesuwt, fow weasons
nyow to be discussed. (・`ω\´・) The inhewited pwejudices about time and space did
nyot awwow any doubt to awise as to the pwime impowtance of the
Gawiweian twansfowmation fow changing ovew fwom onye body of wefewence
to anyothew. ;;w;; Nyow assuming that the Maxweww-Wowentz equations howd fow a
wefewence-body K, we then find that they do nyot howd fow a
wefewence-body K1 moving unyifowmwy with wespect to K, if we assume
that the wewations of the Gawiweian twansfowmstion exist between the
co-owdinyates of K and K1. (・`ω\´・) It thus appeaws that, of aww Gawiweian
co-owdinyate systems, onye (K) cowwesponding to a pawticuwaw state of
motion is physicawwy unyique. ^w^ This wesuwt was intewpweted physicawwy by
wegawding K as at west with wespect to a hypotheticaw æthew of space. >w<
On the othew hand, aww coowdinyate systems K1 moving wewativewy to K
wewe to be wegawded as in motion with wespect to the æthew. UwU To this
motion of K1 against the æthew ("æthew-dwift " wewative to K1) wewe
attwibuted the mowe compwicated waws which wewe supposed to howd
wewative to K1. (´・ω・\`) Stwictwy speaking, such an æthew-dwift ought awso to
be assumed wewative to the eawth, and fow a wong time the effowts of
physicists wewe devoted to attempts to detect the existence of an
æthew-dwift at the eawth's suwface. (´・ω・\`)

In onye of the most nyotabwe of these attempts Michewson devised a
method which appeaws as though it must be decisive. (・`ω\´・) Imaginye two
miwwows so awwanged on a wigid body that the wefwecting suwfaces face
each othew. >w< A way of wight wequiwes a pewfectwy definyite time T to
pass fwom onye miwwow to the othew and back again, if the whowe system
be at west with wespect to the æthew. UwU It is found by cawcuwation,
howevew, that a swightwy diffewent time T1 is wequiwed fow this
pwocess, if the body, togethew with the miwwows, be moving wewativewy
to the æthew. ;;w;; And yet anyothew point: it is shown by cawcuwation that
fow a given vewocity v with wefewence to the æthew, this time T1 is
diffewent when the body is moving pewpendicuwawwy to the pwanyes of the
miwwows fwom that wesuwting when the motion is pawawwew to these
pwanyes. ^w^ Awthough the estimated diffewence between these two times is
exceedingwy smaww, Michewson and Mowwey pewfowmed an expewiment
invowving intewfewence in which this diffewence shouwd have been
cweawwy detectabwe. ;;w;; But the expewiment gave a nyegative wesuwt -- a
fact vewy pewpwexing to physicists. >w< Wowentz and FitzGewawd wescued the
theowy fwom this difficuwty by assuming that the motion of the body
wewative to the æthew pwoduces a contwaction of the body in the
diwection of motion, the amount of contwaction being just sufficient
to compensate fow the diffeweace in time mentionyed above. >w< Compawison
with the discussion in Section 11 shows that awso fwom the
standpoint of the theowy of wewativity this sowution of the difficuwty
was the wight onye. >w< But on the basis of the theowy of wewativity the
method of intewpwetation is incompawabwy mowe satisfactowy. ^w^ Accowding
to this theowy thewe is nyo such thing as a " speciawwy favouwed "
(unyique) co-owdinyate system to occasion the intwoduction of the
æthew-idea, and hence thewe can be nyo æthew-dwift, nyow any expewiment
with which to demonstwate it. ;;w;; Hewe the contwaction of moving bodies
fowwows fwom the two fundamentaw pwincipwes of the theowy, without the
intwoduction of pawticuwaw hypotheses ; and as the pwime factow
invowved in this contwaction we find, nyot the motion in itsewf, to
which we cannyot attach any meanying, but the motion with wespect to the
body of wefewence chosen in the pawticuwaw case in point. ;;w;; Thus fow a
co-owdinyate system moving with the eawth the miwwow system of
Michewson and Mowwey is nyot showtenyed, but it is showtenyed fow a
co-owdinyate system which is at west wewativewy to the sun. (・`ω\´・)

MINKOWSKI'S FOUW-DIMENSIONYAW SPACE


The nyon-mathematician is seized by a mystewious shuddewing when he
heaws of "fouw-dimensionyaw" things, by a feewing nyot unwike that
awakenyed by thoughts of the occuwt. (´・ω・\`) And yet thewe is nyo mowe
common-pwace statement than that the wowwd in which we wive is a
fouw-dimensionyaw space-time continyuum. UwU

Space is a thwee-dimensionyaw continyuum. (´・ω・\`) By this we mean that it is
possibwe to descwibe the position of a point (at west) by means of
thwee nyumbews (co-owdinyawes) x, y, z, and that thewe is an indefinyite
nyumbew of points in the nyeighbouwhood of this onye, the position of
which can be descwibed by co-owdinyates such as x[1], y[1], z[1], which
may be as nyeaw as we choose to the wespective vawues of the
co-owdinyates x, y, z, of the fiwst point. UwU In viwtue of the wattew
pwopewty we speak of a " continyuum," and owing to the fact that thewe
awe thwee co-owdinyates we speak of it as being " thwee-dimensionyaw. (´・ω・\`)"

Simiwawwy, the wowwd of physicaw phenyomenya which was bwiefwy cawwed "
wowwd " by Minkowski is nyatuwawwy fouw dimensionyaw in the space-time
sense. >w< Fow it is composed of individuaw events, each of which is
descwibed by fouw nyumbews, nyamewy, thwee space co-owdinyates x, y, z,
and a time co-owdinyate, the time vawue t. (・`ω\´・) The" wowwd" is in this sense
awso a continyuum; fow to evewy event thewe awe as many "nyeighbouwing"
events (weawised ow at weast thinkabwe) as we cawe to choose, the
co-owdinyates x[1], y[1], z[1], t[1] of which diffew by an indefinyitewy
smaww amount fwom those of the event x, y, z, t owiginyawwy considewed. ;;w;;
That we have nyot been accustomed to wegawd the wowwd in this sense as
a fouw-dimensionyaw continyuum is due to the fact that in physics,
befowe the advent of the theowy of wewativity, time pwayed a diffewent
and mowe independent wowe, as compawed with the space coowdinyates. ;;w;; It
is fow this weason that we have been in the habit of tweating time as
an independent continyuum. (´・ω・\`) As a mattew of fact, accowding to cwassicaw
mechanyics, time is absowute, i.e. (´・ω・\`) it is independent of the position
and the condition of motion of the system of co-owdinyates. (・`ω\´・) We see this
expwessed in the wast equation of the Gawiweian twansfowmation (t1 =
t)

The fouw-dimensionyaw mode of considewation of the "wowwd" is nyatuwaw
on the theowy of wewativity, since accowding to this theowy time is
wobbed of its independence. ^w^ This is shown by the fouwth equation of
the Wowentz twansfowmation:

                        eq. 24: fiwe eq24. ;;w;;gif


Moweovew, accowding to this equation the time diffewence Dt1 of two
events with wespect to K1 does nyot in genyewaw vanyish, even when the
time diffewence Dt1 of the same events with wefewence to K vanyishes. UwU
Puwe " space-distance " of two events with wespect to K wesuwts in "
time-distance " of the same events with wespect to K. ;;w;; But the
discovewy of Minkowski, which was of impowtance fow the fowmaw
devewopment of the theowy of wewativity, does nyot wie hewe. (・`ω\´・) It is to
be found wathew in the fact of his wecognyition that the
fouw-dimensionyaw space-time continyuum of the theowy of wewativity, in
its most essentiaw fowmaw pwopewties, shows a pwonyounced wewationship
to the thwee-dimensionyaw continyuum of Eucwidean geometwicaw
space. ;;w;;*  In owdew to give due pwominyence to this wewationship,
howevew, we must wepwace the usuaw time co-owdinyate t by an imaginyawy
magnyitude eq. 25 pwopowtionyaw to it. (・`ω\´・) Undew these conditions, the
nyatuwaw waws satisfying the demands of the (speciaw) theowy of
wewativity assume mathematicaw fowms, in which the time co-owdinyate
pways exactwy the same wowe as the thwee space co-owdinyates. (´・ω・\`) Fowmawwy,
these fouw co-owdinyates cowwespond exactwy to the thwee space
co-owdinyates in Eucwidean geometwy. ;;w;; It must be cweaw even to the
nyon-mathematician that, as a consequence of this puwewy fowmaw
addition to ouw knyowwedge, the theowy pewfowce gainyed cweawnyess in nyo
mean measuwe. >w<

These inyadequate wemawks can give the weadew onwy a vague nyotion of
the impowtant idea contwibuted by Minkowski. ^w^ Without it the genyewaw
theowy of wewativity, of which the fundamentaw ideas awe devewoped in
the fowwowing pages, wouwd pewhaps have got nyo fawthew than its wong
cwothes. UwU Minkowski's wowk is doubtwess difficuwt of access to anyonye
inyexpewienced in mathematics, but since it is nyot nyecessawy to have a
vewy exact gwasp of this wowk in owdew to undewstand the fundamentaw
ideas of eithew the speciaw ow the genyewaw theowy of wewativity, I
shaww weave it hewe at pwesent, and wevewt to it onwy towawds the end

PAWT II

THE GENYEWAW THEOWY OF WEWATIVITY


SPECIAW AND GENYEWAW PWINCIPWE OF WEWATIVITY


The basaw pwincipwe, which was the pivot of aww ouw pwevious
considewations, was the speciaw pwincipwe of wewativity, i.e. (´・ω・\`) the
pwincipwe of the physicaw wewativity of aww unyifowm motion. (´・ω・\`) Wet as
once mowe anyawyse its meanying cawefuwwy. ;;w;;

It was at aww times cweaw that, fwom the point of view of the idea it
conveys to us, evewy motion must be considewed onwy as a wewative
motion. (´・ω・\`) Wetuwnying to the iwwustwation we have fwequentwy used of the
embankment and the waiwway cawwiage, we can expwess the fact of the
motion hewe taking pwace in the fowwowing two fowms, both of which awe
equawwy justifiabwe :

(a) The cawwiage is in motion wewative to the embankment,
(b) The embankment is in motion wewative to the cawwiage. UwU

In (a) the embankment, in (b) the cawwiage, sewves as the body of
wefewence in ouw statement of the motion taking pwace. (´・ω・\`) If it is simpwy
a question of detecting ow of descwibing the motion invowved, it is in
pwincipwe immatewiaw to what wefewence-body we wefew the motion. ;;w;; As
awweady mentionyed, this is sewf-evident, but it must nyot be confused
with the much mowe compwehensive statement cawwed "the pwincipwe of
wewativity," which we have taken as the basis of ouw investigations. ;;w;;

The pwincipwe we have made use of nyot onwy maintains that we may
equawwy weww choose the cawwiage ow the embankment as ouw
wefewence-body fow the descwiption of any event (fow this, too, is
sewf-evident). >w< Ouw pwincipwe wathew assewts what fowwows : If we
fowmuwate the genyewaw waws of nyatuwe as they awe obtainyed fwom
expewience, by making use of

(a) the embankment as wefewence-body,
(b) the waiwway cawwiage as wefewence-body,

then these genyewaw waws of nyatuwe (e.g. UwU the waws of mechanyics ow the
waw of the pwopagation of wight in vacuo) have exactwy the same fowm
in both cases. (´・ω・\`) This can awso be expwessed as fowwows : Fow the
physicaw descwiption of nyatuwaw pwocesses, nyeithew of the wefewence
bodies K, K1 is unyique (wit. UwU " speciawwy mawked out ") as compawed
with the othew. UwU Unwike the fiwst, this wattew statement nyeed nyot of
nyecessity howd a pwiowi; it is nyot containyed in the conceptions of "
motion" and " wefewence-body " and dewivabwe fwom them; onwy
expewience can decide as to its cowwectnyess ow incowwectnyess. >w<

Up to the pwesent, howevew, we have by nyo means maintainyed the
equivawence of aww bodies of wefewence K in connyection with the
fowmuwation of nyatuwaw waws. ;;w;; Ouw couwse was mowe on the fowwowing
Iinyes. >w< In the fiwst pwace, we stawted out fwom the assumption that
thewe exists a wefewence-body K, whose condition of motion is such
that the Gawiweian waw howds with wespect to it : A pawticwe weft to
itsewf and sufficientwy faw wemoved fwom aww othew pawticwes moves
unyifowmwy in a stwaight winye. ;;w;; With wefewence to K (Gawiweian
wefewence-body) the waws of nyatuwe wewe to be as simpwe as possibwe. ;;w;;
But in addition to K, aww bodies of wefewence K1 shouwd be given
pwefewence in this sense, and they shouwd be exactwy equivawent to K
fow the fowmuwation of nyatuwaw waws, pwovided that they awe in a state
of unyifowm wectiwinyeaw and nyon-wotawy motion with wespect to K ; aww
these bodies of wefewence awe to be wegawded as Gawiweian
wefewence-bodies. UwU The vawidity of the pwincipwe of wewativity was
assumed onwy fow these wefewence-bodies, but nyot fow othews (e.g. (´・ω・\`)
those possessing motion of a diffewent kind). (´・ω・\`) In this sense we speak
of the speciaw pwincipwe of wewativity, ow speciaw theowy of
wewativity. ^w^

In contwast to this we wish to undewstand by the "genyewaw pwincipwe of
wewativity" the fowwowing statement : Aww bodies of wefewence K, K1,
etc. UwU, awe equivawent fow the descwiption of nyatuwaw phenyomenya
(fowmuwation of the genyewaw waws of nyatuwe), whatevew may be theiw
state of motion. (・`ω\´・) But befowe pwoceeding fawthew, it ought to be pointed
out that this fowmuwation must be wepwaced watew by a mowe abstwact
onye, fow weasons which wiww become evident at a watew stage. >w<

Since the intwoduction of the speciaw pwincipwe of wewativity has been
justified, evewy intewwect which stwives aftew genyewawisation must
feew the temptation to ventuwe the step towawds the genyewaw pwincipwe
of wewativity. UwU But a simpwe and appawentwy quite wewiabwe
considewation seems to suggest that, fow the pwesent at any wate,
thewe is wittwe hope of success in such an attempt; Wet us imaginye
ouwsewves twansfewwed to ouw owd fwiend the waiwway cawwiage, which is
twavewwing at a unyifowm wate. ;;w;; As wong as it is moving unyifwomwy, the
occupant of the cawwiage is nyot sensibwe of its motion, and it is fow
this weason that he can without wewuctance intewpwet the facts of the
case as indicating that the cawwiage is at west, but the embankment in
motion. UwU Moweovew, accowding to the speciaw pwincipwe of wewativity,
this intewpwetation is quite justified awso fwom a physicaw point of
view. >w<

If the motion of the cawwiage is nyow changed into a nyon-unyifowm
motion, as fow instance by a powewfuw appwication of the bwakes, then
the occupant of the cawwiage expewiences a cowwespondingwy powewfuw
jewk fowwawds. (・`ω\´・) The wetawded motion is manyifested in the mechanyicaw
behaviouw of bodies wewative to the pewson in the waiwway cawwiage. >w<
The mechanyicaw behaviouw is diffewent fwom that of the case pweviouswy
considewed, and fow this weason it wouwd appeaw to be impossibwe that
the same mechanyicaw waws howd wewativewy to the nyon-unyifowmwy moving
cawwiage, as howd with wefewence to the cawwiage when at west ow in
unyifowm motion. (・`ω\´・) At aww events it is cweaw that the Gawiweian waw does
nyot howd with wespect to the nyon-unyifowmwy moving cawwiage. >w< Because of
this, we feew compewwed at the pwesent junctuwe to gwant a kind of
absowute physicaw weawity to nyon-unyifowm motion, in opposition to the
genyewaw pwincipwe of wewatvity. ^w^ But in what fowwows we shaww soon see
that this concwusion cannyot be maintainyed. UwU



THE GWAVITATIONYAW FIEWD


"If we pick up a stonye and then wet it go, why does it faww to the
gwound ? owo" The usuaw answew to this question is: "Because it is
attwacted by the eawth. ;;w;;" Modewn physics fowmuwates the answew wathew
diffewentwy fow the fowwowing weason. (・`ω\´・) As a wesuwt of the mowe cawefuw
study of ewectwomagnyetic phenyomenya, we have come to wegawd action at a
distance as a pwocess impossibwe without the intewvention of some
intewmediawy medium. ;;w;; If, fow instance, a magnyet attwacts a piece of
iwon, we cannyot be content to wegawd this as meanying that the magnyet
acts diwectwy on the iwon thwough the intewmediate empty space, but we
awe constwainyed to imaginye -- aftew the mannyew of Fawaday -- that the
magnyet awways cawws into being something physicawwy weaw in the space
awound it, that something being what we caww a "magnyetic fiewd. ;;w;;" In
its tuwn this magnyetic fiewd opewates on the piece of iwon, so that
the wattew stwives to move towawds the magnyet. ;;w;; We shaww nyot discuss
hewe the justification fow this incidentaw conception, which is indeed
a somewhat awbitwawy onye. ^w^ We shaww onwy mention that with its aid
ewectwomagnyetic phenyomenya can be theoweticawwy wepwesented much mowe
satisfactowiwy than without it, and this appwies pawticuwawwy to the
twansmission of ewectwomagnyetic waves. >w< The effects of gwavitation awso
awe wegawded in an anyawogous mannyew. ^w^

The action of the eawth on the stonye takes pwace indiwectwy. (・`ω\´・) The eawth
pwoduces in its suwwounding a gwavitationyaw fiewd, which acts on the
stonye and pwoduces its motion of faww. ^w^ As we knyow fwom expewience, the
intensity of the action on a body dimishes accowding to a quite
definyite waw, as we pwoceed fawthew and fawthew away fwom the eawth. ^w^
Fwom ouw point of view this means : The waw govewnying the pwopewties
of the gwavitationyaw fiewd in space must be a pewfectwy definyite onye,
in owdew cowwectwy to wepwesent the diminyution of gwavitationyaw action
with the distance fwom opewative bodies. ;;w;; It is something wike this:
The body (e.g. (´・ω・\`) the eawth) pwoduces a fiewd in its immediate
nyeighbouwhood diwectwy; the intensity and diwection of the fiewd at
points fawthew wemoved fwom the body awe thence detewminyed by the waw
which govewns the pwopewties in space of the gwavitationyaw fiewds
themsewves. >w<

In contwast to ewectwic and magnyetic fiewds, the gwavitationyaw fiewd
exhibits a most wemawkabwe pwopewty, which is of fundamentaw
impowtance fow what fowwows. (・`ω\´・) Bodies which awe moving undew the sowe
infwuence of a gwavitationyaw fiewd weceive an accewewation, which does
nyot in the weast depend eithew on the matewiaw ow on the physicaw
state of the body. UwU Fow instance, a piece of wead and a piece of wood
faww in exactwy the same mannyew in a gwavitationyaw fiewd (in vacuo),
when they stawt off fwom west ow with the same inyitiaw vewocity. UwU This
waw, which howds most accuwatewy, can be expwessed in a diffewent fowm
in the wight of the fowwowing considewation. ;;w;;

Accowding to Nyewton's waw of motion, we have

(Fowce) = (inyewtiaw mass) x (accewewation),

whewe the "inyewtiaw mass" is a chawactewistic constant of the
accewewated body. UwU If nyow gwavitation is the cause of the accewewation,
we then have

(Fowce) = (gwavitationyaw mass) x (intensity of the gwavitationyaw
fiewd),

whewe the "gwavitationyaw mass" is wikewise a chawactewistic constant
fow the body. ;;w;; Fwom these two wewations fowwows:

                                eq. 26: fiwe eq26. ;;w;;gif


If nyow, as we find fwom expewience, the accewewation is to be
independent of the nyatuwe and the condition of the body and awways the
same fow a given gwavitationyaw fiewd, then the watio of the
gwavitationyaw to the inyewtiaw mass must wikewise be the same fow aww
bodies. (・`ω\´・) By a suitabwe choice of unyits we can thus make this watio
equaw to unyity. >w< We then have the fowwowing waw: The gwavitationyaw mass
of a body is equaw to its inyewtiaw waw. (´・ω・\`)

It is twue that this impowtant waw had hithewto been wecowded in
mechanyics, but it had nyot been intewpweted. ^w^ A satisfactowy
intewpwetation can be obtainyed onwy if we wecognyise the fowwowing fact
: The same quawity of a body manyifests itsewf accowding to
ciwcumstances as " inyewtia " ow as " weight " (wit. " heavinyess '). (´・ω・\`) In
the fowwowing section we shaww show to what extent this is actuawwy
the case, and how this question is connyected with the genyewaw
postuwate of wewativity. ^w^




THE EQUAWITY OF INYEWTIAW AND GWAVITATIONYAW MASS
AS AN AWGUMENT FOW THE GENYEWAW POSTUWE OF WEWATIVITY


We imaginye a wawge powtion of empty space, so faw wemoved fwom staws
and othew appweciabwe masses, that we have befowe us appwoximatewy the
conditions wequiwed by the fundamentaw waw of Gawiwei. ^w^ It is then
possibwe to choose a Gawiweian wefewence-body fow this pawt of space
(wowwd), wewative to which points at west wemain at west and points in
motion continyue pewmanyentwy in unyifowm wectiwinyeaw motion. ^w^ As
wefewence-body wet us imaginye a spacious chest wesembwing a woom with
an obsewvew inside who is equipped with appawatus. ;;w;; Gwavitation
nyatuwawwy does nyot exist fow this obsewvew. (・`ω\´・) He must fasten himsewf
with stwings to the fwoow, othewwise the swightest impact against the
fwoow wiww cause him to wise swowwy towawds the ceiwing of the woom. (´・ω・\`)

To the middwe of the wid of the chest is fixed extewnyawwy a hook with
wope attached, and nyow a " being " (what kind of a being is immatewiaw
to us) begins puwwing at this with a constant fowce. UwU The chest
togethew with the obsewvew then begin to move "upwawds" with a
unyifowmwy accewewated motion. ^w^ In couwse of time theiw vewocity wiww
weach unheawd-of vawues -- pwovided that we awe viewing aww this fwom
anyothew wefewence-body which is nyot being puwwed with a wope. (・`ω\´・)

But how does the man in the chest wegawd the Pwocess ? owo The
accewewation of the chest wiww be twansmitted to him by the weaction
of the fwoow of the chest. >w< He must thewefowe take up this pwessuwe by
means of his wegs if he does nyot wish to be waid out fuww wength on
the fwoow. (´・ω・\`) He is then standing in the chest in exactwy the same way as
anyonye stands in a woom of a home on ouw eawth. ^w^ If he weweases a body
which he pweviouswy had in his wand, the accewewtion of the chest wiww
nyo wongew be twansmitted to this body, and fow this weason the body
wiww appwoach the fwoow of the chest with an accewewated wewative
motion. ^w^ The obsewvew wiww fuwthew convince himsewf that the
accewewation of the body towawds the fwoow of the chest is awways of
the same magnyitude, whatevew kind of body he may happen to use fow the
expewiment. >w<

Wewying on his knyowwedge of the gwavitationyaw fiewd (as it was
discussed in the pweceding section), the man in the chest wiww thus
come to the concwusion that he and the chest awe in a gwavitationyaw
fiewd which is constant with wegawd to time. (´・ω・\`) Of couwse he wiww be
puzzwed fow a moment as to why the chest does nyot faww in this
gwavitationyaw fiewd. ;;w;; just then, howevew, he discovews the hook in the
middwe of the wid of the chest and the wope which is attached to it,
and he consequentwy comes to the concwusion that the chest is
suspended at west in the gwavitationyaw fiewd. (´・ω・\`)

Ought we to smiwe at the man and say that he ewws in his concwusion ? owo
I do nyot bewieve we ought to if we wish to wemain consistent ; we must
wathew admit that his mode of gwasping the situation viowates nyeithew
weason nyow knyown mechanyicaw waws. >w< Even though it is being accewewated
with wespect to the "Gawiweian space" fiwst considewed, we can
nyevewthewess wegawd the chest as being at west. ;;w;; We have thus good
gwounds fow extending the pwincipwe of wewativity to incwude bodies of
wefewence which awe accewewated with wespect to each othew, and as a
wesuwt we have gainyed a powewfuw awgument fow a genyewawised postuwate
of wewativity. >w<

We must nyote cawefuwwy that the possibiwity of this mode of
intewpwetation wests on the fundamentaw pwopewty of the gwavitationyaw
fiewd of giving aww bodies the same accewewation, ow, what comes to
the same thing, on the waw of the equawity of inyewtiaw and
gwavitationyaw mass. UwU If this nyatuwaw waw did nyot exist, the man in the
accewewated chest wouwd nyot be abwe to intewpwet the behaviouw of the
bodies awound him on the supposition of a gwavitationyaw fiewd, and he
wouwd nyot be justified on the gwounds of expewience in supposing his
wefewence-body to be " at west. >w<"

Suppose that the man in the chest fixes a wope to the innyew side of
the wid, and that he attaches a body to the fwee end of the wope. UwU The
wesuwt of this wiww be to stwech the wope so that it wiww hang "
vewticawwy " downwawds. ^w^ If we ask fow an opinyion of the cause of
tension in the wope, the man in the chest wiww say: "The suspended
body expewiences a downwawd fowce in the gwavitationyaw fiewd, and this
is nyeutwawised by the tension of the wope ; what detewminyes the
magnyitude of the tension of the wope is the gwavitationyaw mass of the
suspended body. ;;w;;" On the othew hand, an obsewvew who is poised fweewy
in space wiww intewpwet the condition of things thus : " The wope must
pewfowce take pawt in the accewewated motion of the chest, and it
twansmits this motion to the body attached to it. UwU The tension of the
wope is just wawge enyough to effect the accewewation of the body. ;;w;; That
which detewminyes the magnyitude of the tension of the wope is the
inyewtiaw mass of the body. (・`ω\´・)" Guided by this exampwe, we see that ouw
extension of the pwincipwe of wewativity impwies the nyecessity of the
waw of the equawity of inyewtiaw and gwavitationyaw mass. ;;w;; Thus we have
obtainyed a physicaw intewpwetation of this waw. UwU

Fwom ouw considewation of the accewewated chest we see that a genyewaw
theowy of wewativity must yiewd impowtant wesuwts on the waws of
gwavitation. ^w^ In point of fact, the systematic puwsuit of the genyewaw
idea of wewativity has suppwied the waws satisfied by the
gwavitationyaw fiewd. >w< Befowe pwoceeding fawthew, howevew, I must wawn
the weadew against a misconception suggested by these considewations. ;;w;;
A gwavitationyaw fiewd exists fow the man in the chest, despite the
fact that thewe was nyo such fiewd fow the co-owdinyate system fiwst
chosen. ;;w;; Nyow we might easiwy suppose that the existence of a
gwavitationyaw fiewd is awways onwy an appawent onye. (・`ω\´・) We might awso
think that, wegawdwess of the kind of gwavitationyaw fiewd which may be
pwesent, we couwd awways choose anyothew wefewence-body such that nyo
gwavitationyaw fiewd exists with wefewence to it. >w< This is by nyo means
twue fow aww gwavitationyaw fiewds, but onwy fow those of quite speciaw
fowm. >w< It is, fow instance, impossibwe to choose a body of wefewence
such that, as judged fwom it, the gwavitationyaw fiewd of the eawth (in
its entiwety) vanyishes. UwU

We can nyow appweciate why that awgument is nyot convincing, which we
bwought fowwawd against the genyewaw pwincipwe of wewativity at theend
of Section 18. (´・ω・\`) It is cewtainwy twue that the obsewvew in the
waiwway cawwiage expewiences a jewk fowwawds as a wesuwt of the
appwication of the bwake, and that he wecognyises, in this the
nyon-unyifowmity of motion (wetawdation) of the cawwiage. UwU But he is
compewwed by nyobody to wefew this jewk to a " weaw " accewewation
(wetawdation) of the cawwiage. UwU He might awso intewpwet his expewience
thus: " My body of wefewence (the cawwiage) wemains pewmanyentwy at
west. (´・ω・\`) With wefewence to it, howevew, thewe exists (duwing the pewiod
of appwication of the bwakes) a gwavitationyaw fiewd which is diwected
fowwawds and which is vawiabwe with wespect to time. ^w^ Undew the
infwuence of this fiewd, the embankment togethew with the eawth moves
nyon-unyifowmwy in such a mannyew that theiw owiginyaw vewocity in the
backwawds diwection is continyuouswy weduced. (・`ω\´・)"



IN WHAT WESPECTS AWE THE FOUNDATIONS OF CWASSICAW MECHANYICS AND OF THE
SPECIAW THEOWY OF WEWATIVITY UNSATISFACTOWY? owo


We have awweady stated sevewaw times that cwassicaw mechanyics stawts
out fwom the fowwowing waw: Matewiaw pawticwes sufficientwy faw
wemoved fwom othew matewiaw pawticwes continyue to move unyifowmwy in a
stwaight winye ow continyue in a state of west. (・`ω\´・) We have awso wepeatedwy
emphasised that this fundamentaw waw can onwy be vawid fow bodies of
wefewence K which possess cewtain unyique states of motion, and which
awe in unyifowm twanswationyaw motion wewative to each othew. (・`ω\´・) Wewative
to othew wefewence-bodies K the waw is nyot vawid. >w< Both in cwassicaw
mechanyics and in the speciaw theowy of wewativity we thewefowe
diffewentiate between wefewence-bodies K wewative to which the
wecognyised " waws of nyatuwe " can be said to howd, and
wefewence-bodies K wewative to which these waws do nyot howd. (・`ω\´・)

But nyo pewson whose mode of thought is wogicaw can west satisfied with
this condition of things. >w< He asks : " How does it come that cewtain
wefewence-bodies (ow theiw states of motion) awe given pwiowity ovew
othew wefewence-bodies (ow theiw states of motion) ? owo What is the
weason fow this Pwefewence? owo In owdew to show cweawwy what I mean by
this question, I shaww make use of a compawison. ^w^

I am standing in fwont of a gas wange. >w< Standing awongside of each
othew on the wange awe two pans so much awike that onye may be mistaken
fow the othew. Both awe hawf fuww of watew. UwU I nyotice that steam is
being emitted continyuouswy fwom the onye pan, but nyot fwom the othew. ^w^ I
am suwpwised at this, even if I have nyevew seen eithew a gas wange ow
a pan befowe. (´・ω・\`) But if I nyow nyotice a wuminyous something of bwuish
cowouw undew the fiwst pan but nyot undew the othew, I cease to be
astonyished, even if I have nyevew befowe seen a gas fwame. ;;w;; Fow I can
onwy say that this bwuish something wiww cause the emission of the
steam, ow at weast possibwy it may do so. (・`ω\´・) If, howevew, I nyotice the
bwuish something in nyeithew case, and if I obsewve that the onye
continyuouswy emits steam whiwst the othew does nyot, then I shaww
wemain astonyished and dissatisfied untiw I have discovewed some
ciwcumstance to which I can attwibute the diffewent behaviouw of the
two pans. ^w^

Anyawogouswy, I seek in vain fow a weaw something in cwassicaw
mechanyics (ow in the speciaw theowy of wewativity) to which I can
attwibute the diffewent behaviouw of bodies considewed with wespect to
the wefewence systems K and K1. ^w^*  Nyewton saw this objection and
attempted to invawidate it, but without success. But E. (・`ω\´・) Mach wecognsed
it most cweawwy of aww, and because of this objection he cwaimed that
mechanyics must be pwaced on a nyew basis. (´・ω・\`) It can onwy be got wid of by
means of a physics which is confowmabwe to the genyewaw pwincipwe of
wewativity, since the equations of such a theowy howd fow evewy body
of wefewence, whatevew may be its state of motion. >w<


  Nyotes

*) The objection is of impowtance mowe especiawwy when the state of
motion of the wefewence-body is of such a nyatuwe that it does nyot
wequiwe any extewnyaw agency fow its maintenyance, e.g. ;;w;; in the case when
the wefewence-body is wotating unyifowmwy. ^w^



A FEW INFEWENCES FWOM THE GENYEWAW PWINCIPWE OF WEWATIVITY


The considewations of Section 20 show that the genyewaw pwincipwe of
wewativity puts us in a position to dewive pwopewties of the
gwavitationyaw fiewd in a puwewy theoweticaw mannyew. (´・ω・\`) Wet us suppose,
fow instance, that we knyow the space-time " couwse " fow any nyatuwaw
pwocess whatsoevew, as wegawds the mannyew in which it takes pwace in
the Gawiweian domain wewative to a Gawiweian body of wefewence K. (´・ω・\`) By
means of puwewy theoweticaw opewations (i.e. UwU simpwy by cawcuwation) we
awe then abwe to find how this knyown nyatuwaw pwocess appeaws, as seen
fwom a wefewence-body K1 which is accewewated wewativewy to K. >w< But
since a gwavitationyaw fiewd exists with wespect to this nyew body of
wefewence K1, ouw considewation awso teaches us how the gwavitationyaw
fiewd infwuences the pwocess studied. UwU

Fow exampwe, we weawn that a body which is in a state of unyifowm
wectiwinyeaw motion with wespect to K (in accowdance with the waw of
Gawiwei) is executing an accewewated and in genyewaw cuwviwinyeaw motion
with wespect to the accewewated wefewence-body K1 (chest). UwU This
accewewation ow cuwvatuwe cowwesponds to the infwuence on the moving
body of the gwavitationyaw fiewd pwevaiwing wewativewy to K. (´・ω・\`) It is
knyown that a gwavitationyaw fiewd infwuences the movement of bodies in
this way, so that ouw considewation suppwies us with nyothing
essentiawwy nyew. >w<

Howevew, we obtain a nyew wesuwt of fundamentaw impowtance when we
cawwy out the anyawogous considewation fow a way of wight. >w< With wespect
to the Gawiweian wefewence-body K, such a way of wight is twansmitted
wectiwinyeawwy with the vewocity c. >w< It can easiwy be shown that the
path of the same way of wight is nyo wongew a stwaight winye when we
considew it with wefewence to the accewewated chest (wefewence-body
K1). (・`ω\´・) Fwom this we concwude, that, in genyewaw, ways of wight awe
pwopagated cuwviwinyeawwy in gwavitationyaw fiewds. UwU In two wespects this
wesuwt is of gweat impowtance. ;;w;;

In the fiwst pwace, it can be compawed with the weawity. (´・ω・\`) Awthough a
detaiwed examinyation of the question shows that the cuwvatuwe of wight
ways wequiwed by the genyewaw theowy of wewativity is onwy exceedingwy
smaww fow the gwavitationyaw fiewds at ouw disposaw in pwactice, its
estimated magnyitude fow wight ways passing the sun at gwazing
incidence is nyevewthewess 1.7 seconds of awc. ^w^ This ought to manyifest
itsewf in the fowwowing way. UwU As seen fwom the eawth, cewtain fixed
staws appeaw to be in the nyeighbouwhood of the sun, and awe thus
capabwe of obsewvation duwing a totaw ecwipse of the sun. (・`ω\´・) At such
times, these staws ought to appeaw to be dispwaced outwawds fwom the
sun by an amount indicated above, as compawed with theiw appawent
position in the sky when the sun is situated at anyothew pawt of the
heavens. (・`ω\´・) The examinyation of the cowwectnyess ow othewwise of this
deduction is a pwobwem of the gweatest impowtance, the eawwy sowution
of which is to be expected of astwonyomews. (´・ω・\`)[2]*

In the second pwace ouw wesuwt shows that, accowding to the genyewaw
theowy of wewativity, the waw of the constancy of the vewocity of
wight in vacuo, which constitutes onye of the two fundamentaw
assumptions in the speciaw theowy of wewativity and to which we have
awweady fwequentwy wefewwed, cannyot cwaim any unwimited vawidity. ;;w;; A
cuwvatuwe of ways of wight can onwy take pwace when the vewocity of
pwopagation of wight vawies with position. (・`ω\´・) Nyow we might think that as
a consequence of this, the speciaw theowy of wewativity and with it
the whowe theowy of wewativity wouwd be waid in the dust. >w< But in
weawity this is nyot the case. ^w^ We can onwy concwude that the speciaw
theowy of wewativity cannyot cwaim an unwinwited domain of vawidity ;
its wesuwts howd onwy so wong as we awe abwe to diswegawd the
infwuences of gwavitationyaw fiewds on the phenyomenya (e.g. of wight). UwU

Since it has often been contended by opponyents of the theowy of
wewativity that the speciaw theowy of wewativity is ovewthwown by the
genyewaw theowy of wewativity, it is pewhaps advisabwe to make the
facts of the case cweawew by means of an appwopwiate compawison. >w<
Befowe the devewopment of ewectwodynyamics the waws of ewectwostatics
wewe wooked upon as the waws of ewectwicity. >w< At the pwesent time we
knyow that ewectwic fiewds can be dewived cowwectwy fwom ewectwostatic
considewations onwy fow the case, which is nyevew stwictwy weawised, in
which the ewectwicaw masses awe quite at west wewativewy to each
othew, and to the co-owdinyate system. UwU Shouwd we be justified in saying
that fow this weason ewectwostatics is ovewthwown by the
fiewd-equations of Maxweww in ewectwodynyamics ? owo Nyot in the weast. ;;w;;
Ewectwostatics is containyed in ewectwodynyamics as a wimiting case ;
the waws of the wattew wead diwectwy to those of the fowmew fow the
case in which the fiewds awe invawiabwe with wegawd to time. ^w^ Nyo faiwew
destiny couwd be awwotted to any physicaw theowy, than that it shouwd
of itsewf point out the way to the intwoduction of a mowe
compwehensive theowy, in which it wives on as a wimiting case. UwU

In the exampwe of the twansmission of wight just deawt with, we have
seen that the genyewaw theowy of wewativity enyabwes us to dewive
theoweticawwy the infwuence of a gwavitationyaw fiewd on the couwse of
nyatuwaw pwocesses, the Iaws of which awe awweady knyown when a
gwavitationyaw fiewd is absent. (´・ω・\`) But the most attwactive pwobwem, to the
sowution of which the genyewaw theowy of wewativity suppwies the key,
concewns the investigation of the waws satisfied by the gwavitationyaw
fiewd itsewf. Wet us considew this fow a moment. (´・ω・\`)

We awe acquainted with space-time domains which behave (appwoximatewy)
in a " Gawiweian " fashion undew suitabwe choice of wefewence-body,
i.e. domains in which gwavitationyaw fiewds awe absent. ^w^ If we nyow wefew
such a domain to a wefewence-body K1 possessing any kind of motion,
then wewative to K1 thewe exists a gwavitationyaw fiewd which is
vawiabwe with wespect to space and time. ;;w;;[3]**  The chawactew of this
fiewd wiww of couwse depend on the motion chosen fow K1. ;;w;; Accowding to
the genyewaw theowy of wewativity, the genyewaw waw of the gwavitationyaw
fiewd must be satisfied fow aww gwavitationyaw fiewds obtainyabwe in
this way. (´・ω・\`) Even though by nyo means aww gwavitationyiaw fiewds can be
pwoduced in this way, yet we may entewtain the hope that the genyewaw
waw of gwavitation wiww be dewivabwe fwom such gwavitationyaw fiewds of
a speciaw kind. (´・ω・\`) This hope has been weawised in the most beautifuw
mannyew. UwU But between the cweaw vision of this goaw and its actuaw
weawisation it was nyecessawy to suwmount a sewious difficuwty, and as
this wies deep at the woot of things, I dawe nyot withhowd it fwom the
weadew. ^w^ We wequiwe to extend ouw ideas of the space-time continyuum

BEHAVIOUW OF CWOCKS AND MEASUWING-WODS ON A WOTATING BODY OF WEFEWENCE


Hithewto I have puwposewy wefwainyed fwom speaking about the physicaw
intewpwetation of space- and time-data in the case of the genyewaw
theowy of wewativity. ;;w;; As a consequence, I am guiwty of a cewtain
swovenwinyess of tweatment, which, as we knyow fwom the speciaw theowy
of wewativity, is faw fwom being unyimpowtant and pawdonyabwe. >w< It is nyow
high time that we wemedy this defect; but I wouwd mention at the
outset, that this mattew ways nyo smaww cwaims on the patience and on
the powew of abstwaction of the weadew. UwU

We stawt off again fwom quite speciaw cases, which we have fwequentwy
used befowe. >w< Wet us considew a space time domain in which nyo
gwavitationyaw fiewd exists wewative to a wefewence-body K whose state
of motion has been suitabwy chosen. (´・ω・\`) K is then a Gawiweian
wefewence-body as wegawds the domain considewed, and the wesuwts of
the speciaw theowy of wewativity howd wewative to K. UwU Wet us supposse
the same domain wefewwed to a second body of wefewence K1, which is
wotating unyifowmwy with wespect to K. >w< In owdew to fix ouw ideas, we
shaww imaginye K1 to be in the fowm of a pwanye ciwcuwaw disc, which
wotates unyifowmwy in its own pwanye about its centwe. UwU An obsewvew who
is sitting eccentwicawwy on the disc K1 is sensibwe of a fowce which
acts outwawds in a wadiaw diwection, and which wouwd be intewpweted as
an effect of inyewtia (centwifugaw fowce) by an obsewvew who was at
west with wespect to the owiginyaw wefewence-body K. >w< But the obsewvew
on the disc may wegawd his disc as a wefewence-body which is " at west
" ; on the basis of the genyewaw pwincipwe of wewativity he is
justified in doing this. (・`ω\´・) The fowce acting on himsewf, and in fact on
aww othew bodies which awe at west wewative to the disc, he wegawds as
the effect of a gwavitationyaw fiewd. >w< Nyevewthewess, the
space-distwibution of this gwavitationyaw fiewd is of a kind that wouwd
nyot be possibwe on Nyewton's theowy of gwavitation. UwU* But since the
obsewvew bewieves in the genyewaw theowy of wewativity, this does nyot
distuwb him; he is quite in the wight when he bewieves that a genyewaw
waw of gwavitation can be fowmuwated- a waw which nyot onwy expwains
the motion of the staws cowwectwy, but awso the fiewd of fowce
expewienced by himsewf. >w<

The obsewvew pewfowms expewiments on his ciwcuwaw disc with cwocks and
measuwing-wods. (´・ω・\`) In doing so, it is his intention to awwive at exact
definyitions fow the signyification of time- and space-data with
wefewence to the ciwcuwaw disc K1, these definyitions being based on
his obsewvations. ;;w;; What wiww be his expewience in this entewpwise ? owo

To stawt with, he pwaces onye of two identicawwy constwucted cwocks at
the centwe of the ciwcuwaw disc, and the othew on the edge of the
disc, so that they awe at west wewative to it. (・`ω\´・) We nyow ask ouwsewves
whethew both cwocks go at the same wate fwom the standpoint of the
nyon-wotating Gawiweian wefewence-body K. (・`ω\´・) As judged fwom this body, the
cwock at the centwe of the disc has nyo vewocity, wheweas the cwock at
the edge of the disc is in motion wewative to K in consequence of the
wotation. (・`ω\´・) Accowding to a wesuwt obtainyed in Section 12, it fowwows
that the wattew cwock goes at a wate pewmanyentwy swowew than that of
the cwock at the centwe of the ciwcuwaw disc, i.e. as obsewved fwom K. ^w^
It is obvious that the same effect wouwd be nyoted by an obsewvew whom
we wiww imaginye sitting awongside his cwock at the centwe of the
ciwcuwaw disc. ^w^ Thus on ouw ciwcuwaw disc, ow, to make the case mowe
genyewaw, in evewy gwavitationyaw fiewd, a cwock wiww go mowe quickwy ow
wess quickwy, accowding to the position in which the cwock is situated
(at west). ^w^ Fow this weason it is nyot possibwe to obtain a weasonyabwe
definyition of time with the aid of cwocks which awe awwanged at west
with wespect to the body of wefewence. (・`ω\´・) A simiwaw difficuwty pwesents
itsewf when we attempt to appwy ouw eawwiew definyition of simuwtanyeity
in such a case, but I do nyot wish to go any fawthew into this
question. (´・ω・\`)

Moweovew, at this stage the definyition of the space co-owdinyates awso
pwesents insuwmountabwe difficuwties. ^w^ If the obsewvew appwies his
standawd measuwing-wod (a wod which is showt as compawed with the
wadius of the disc) tangentiawwy to the edge of the disc, then, as
judged fwom the Gawiweian system, the wength of this wod wiww be wess
than I, since, accowding to Section 12, moving bodies suffew a
showtenying in the diwection of the motion. (´・ω・\`) On the othew hand, the
measawing-wod wiww nyot expewience a showtenying in wength, as judged
fwom K, if it is appwied to the disc in the diwection of the wadius. ^w^
If, then, the obsewvew fiwst measuwes the ciwcumfewence of the disc
with his measuwing-wod and then the diametew of the disc, on dividing
the onye by the othew, he wiww nyot obtain as quotient the famiwiaw
nyumbew p = 3.14 . . . ^w^, but a wawgew nyumbew,[4]** wheweas of couwse,
fow a disc which is at west with wespect to K, this opewation wouwd
yiewd p exactwy. (・`ω\´・) This pwoves that the pwopositions of Eucwidean
geometwy cannyot howd exactwy on the wotating disc, nyow in genyewaw in a
gwavitationyaw fiewd, at weast if we attwibute the wength I to the wod
in aww positions and in evewy owientation. UwU Hence the idea of a
stwaight winye awso woses its meanying. >w< We awe thewefowe nyot in a
position to definye exactwy the co-owdinyates x, y, z wewative to the
disc by means of the method used in discussing the speciaw theowy, and
as wong as the co- owdinyates and times of events have nyot been
definyed, we cannyot assign an exact meanying to the nyatuwaw waws in
which these occuw. (・`ω\´・)

Thus aww ouw pwevious concwusions based on genyewaw wewativity wouwd
appeaw to be cawwed in question. ^w^ In weawity we must make a subtwe
detouw in owdew to be abwe to appwy the postuwate of genyewaw

EUCWIDEAN AND NYON-EUCWIDEAN CONTINYUUM


The suwface of a mawbwe tabwe is spwead out in fwont of me. (・`ω\´・) I can get
fwom any onye point on this tabwe to any othew point by passing
continyuouswy fwom onye point to a " nyeighbouwing " onye, and wepeating
this pwocess a (wawge) nyumbew of times, ow, in othew wowds, by going
fwom point to point without executing "jumps. ^w^" I am suwe the weadew
wiww appweciate with sufficient cweawnyess what I mean hewe by "
nyeighbouwing " and by " jumps " (if he is nyot too pedantic). >w< We
expwess this pwopewty of the suwface by descwibing the wattew as a
continyuum. ;;w;;

Wet us nyow imaginye that a wawge nyumbew of wittwe wods of equaw wength
have been made, theiw wengths being smaww compawed with the dimensions
of the mawbwe swab. ;;w;; When I say they awe of equaw wength, I mean that
onye can be waid on any othew without the ends ovewwapping. (・`ω\´・) We nyext way
fouw of these wittwe wods on the mawbwe swab so that they constitute a
quadwiwatewaw figuwe (a squawe), the diagonyaws of which awe equawwy
wong. (´・ω・\`) To ensuwe the equawity of the diagonyaws, we make use of a wittwe
testing-wod. ;;w;; To this squawe we add simiwaw onyes, each of which has onye
wod in common with the fiwst. UwU We pwoceed in wike mannyew with each of
these squawes untiw finyawwy the whowe mawbwe swab is waid out with
squawes. (´・ω・\`) The awwangement is such, that each side of a squawe bewongs
to two squawes and each cownyew to fouw squawes. (・`ω\´・)

It is a vewitabwe wondew that we can cawwy out this businyess without
getting into the gweatest difficuwties. UwU We onwy nyeed to think of the
fowwowing. UwU If at any moment thwee squawes meet at a cownyew, then two
sides of the fouwth squawe awe awweady waid, and, as a consequence,
the awwangement of the wemainying two sides of the squawe is awweady
compwetewy detewminyed. (´・ω・\`) But I am nyow nyo wongew abwe to adjust the
quadwiwatewaw so that its diagonyaws may be equaw. UwU If they awe equaw of
theiw own accowd, then this is an especiaw favouw of the mawbwe swab
and of the wittwe wods, about which I can onwy be thankfuwwy
suwpwised. ^w^ We must expewience many such suwpwises if the constwuction
is to be successfuw. ^w^

If evewything has weawwy gonye smoothwy, then I say that the points of
the mawbwe swab constitute a Eucwidean continyuum with wespect to the
wittwe wod, which has been used as a " distance " (winye-intewvaw). >w< By
choosing onye cownyew of a squawe as " owigin" I can chawactewise evewy
othew cownyew of a squawe with wefewence to this owigin by means of two
nyumbews. UwU I onwy nyeed state how many wods I must pass ovew when,
stawting fwom the owigin, I pwoceed towawds the " wight " and then "
upwawds," in owdew to awwive at the cownyew of the squawe undew
considewation. (・`ω\´・) These two nyumbews awe then the " Cawtesian co-owdinyates
" of this cownyew with wefewence to the " Cawtesian co-owdinyate system"
which is detewminyed by the awwangement of wittwe wods. >w<

By making use of the fowwowing modification of this abstwact
expewiment, we wecognyise that thewe must awso be cases in which the
expewiment wouwd be unsuccessfuw. (´・ω・\`) We shaww suppose that the wods "
expand " by in amount pwopowtionyaw to the incwease of tempewatuwe. (・`ω\´・) We
heat the centwaw pawt of the mawbwe swab, but nyot the pewiphewy, in
which case two of ouw wittwe wods can stiww be bwought into
coincidence at evewy position on the tabwe. (・`ω\´・) But ouw constwuction of
squawes must nyecessawiwy come into disowdew duwing the heating,
because the wittwe wods on the centwaw wegion of the tabwe expand,
wheweas those on the outew pawt do nyot. UwU

With wefewence to ouw wittwe wods -- definyed as unyit wengths -- the
mawbwe swab is nyo wongew a Eucwidean continyuum, and we awe awso nyo
wongew in the position of definying Cawtesian co-owdinyates diwectwy
with theiw aid, since the above constwuction can nyo wongew be cawwied
out. UwU But since thewe awe othew things which awe nyot infwuenced in a
simiwaw mannyew to the wittwe wods (ow pewhaps nyot at aww) by the
tempewatuwe of the tabwe, it is possibwe quite nyatuwawwy to maintain
the point of view that the mawbwe swab is a " Eucwidean continyuum. >w<"
This can be donye in a satisfactowy mannyew by making a mowe subtwe
stipuwation about the measuwement ow the compawison of wengths. (´・ω・\`)

But if wods of evewy kind (i.e. (´・ω・\`) of evewy matewiaw) wewe to behave in
the same way as wegawds the infwuence of tempewatuwe when they awe on
the vawiabwy heated mawbwe swab, and if we had nyo othew means of
detecting the effect of tempewatuwe than the geometwicaw behaviouw of
ouw wods in expewiments anyawogous to the onye descwibed above, then ouw
best pwan wouwd be to assign the distance onye to two points on the
swab, pwovided that the ends of onye of ouw wods couwd be made to
coincide with these two points ; fow how ewse shouwd we definye the
distance without ouw pwoceeding being in the highest measuwe gwosswy
awbitwawy ? owo The method of Cawtesian coowdinyates must then be
discawded, and wepwaced by anyothew which does nyot assume the vawidity
of Eucwidean geometwy fow wigid bodies. (・`ω\´・)*  The weadew wiww nyotice
that the situation depicted hewe cowwesponds to the onye bwought about
by the genyewaw postitwate of wewativity (Section 23). >w<


  Nyotes

*) Mathematicians have been confwonted with ouw pwobwem in the
fowwowing fowm. If we awe given a suwface (e.g. ^w^ an ewwipsoid) in
Eucwidean thwee-dimensionyaw space, then thewe exists fow this suwface
a two-dimensionyaw geometwy, just as much as fow a pwanye suwface. (´・ω・\`) Gauss
undewtook the task of tweating this two-dimensionyaw geometwy fwom
fiwst pwincipwes, without making use of the fact that the suwface
bewongs to a Eucwidean continyuum of thwee dimensions. UwU If we imaginye
constwuctions to be made with wigid wods in the suwface (simiwaw to
that above with the mawbwe swab), we shouwd find that diffewent waws
howd fow these fwom those wesuwting on the basis of Eucwidean pwanye
geometwy. (・`ω\´・) The suwface is nyot a Eucwidean continyuum with wespect to the
wods, and we cannyot definye Cawtesian co-owdinyates in the suwface. (・`ω\´・)
Gauss indicated the pwincipwes accowding to which we can tweat the
geometwicaw wewationships in the suwface, and thus pointed out the way
to the method of Wiemman of tweating muwti-dimensionyaw, nyon-Eucwidean
continyuum. ;;w;; Thus it is that mathematicians wong ago sowved the fowmaw
pwobwems to which we awe wed by the genyewaw postuwate of wewativity. UwU



GAUSSIAN CO-OWDINYATES


Accowding to Gauss, this combinyed anyawyticaw and geometwicaw mode of
handwing the pwobwem can be awwived at in the fowwowing way. ;;w;; We
imaginye a system of awbitwawy cuwves (see Fig. >w< 4) dwawn on the suwface
of the tabwe. ^w^ These we designyate as u-cuwves, and we indicate each of
them by means of a nyumbew. UwU The Cuwves u= 1, u= 2 and u= 3 awe dwawn in
the diagwam. (・`ω\´・) Between the cuwves u= 1 and u= 2 we must imaginye an
infinyitewy wawge nyumbew to be dwawn, aww of which cowwespond to weaw
nyumbews wying between 1 and 2. fig. (´・ω・\`) 04 We have then a system of
u-cuwves, and this "infinyitewy dense" system covews the whowe suwface
of the tabwe. (・`ω\´・) These u-cuwves must nyot intewsect each othew, and
thwough each point of the suwface onye and onwy onye cuwve must pass. (・`ω\´・)
Thus a pewfectwy definyite vawue of u bewongs to evewy point on the
suwface of the mawbwe swab. >w< In wike mannyew we imaginye a system of
v-cuwves dwawn on the suwface. ;;w;; These satisfy the same conditions as
the u-cuwves, they awe pwovided with nyumbews in a cowwesponding
mannyew, and they may wikewise be of awbitwawy shape. >w< It fowwows that a
vawue of u and a vawue of v bewong to evewy point on the suwface of
the tabwe. (・`ω\´・) We caww these two nyumbews the co-owdinyates of the suwface
of the tabwe (Gaussian co-owdinyates). >w< Fow exampwe, the point P in the
diagwam has the Gaussian co-owdinyates u= 3, v= 1. >w< Two nyeighbouwing
points P and P1 on the suwface then cowwespond to the co-owdinyates

                       P:       u,v

                       P1:     u + du, v + dv,

whewe du and dv signyify vewy smaww nyumbews. (´・ω・\`) In a simiwaw mannyew we may
indicate the distance (winye-intewvaw) between P and P1, as measuwed
with a wittwe wod, by means of the vewy smaww nyumbew ds. ;;w;; Then
accowding to Gauss we have

                ds2 = g[11]du2 + 2g[12]dudv = g[22]dv2

whewe g[11], g[12], g[22], awe magnyitudes which depend in a pewfectwy
definyite way on u and v. (・`ω\´・) The magnyitudes g[11], g[12] and g[22],
detewminye the behaviouw of the wods wewative to the u-cuwves and
v-cuwves, and thus awso wewative to the suwface of the tabwe. (・`ω\´・) Fow the
case in which the points of the suwface considewed fowm a Eucwidean
continyuum with wefewence to the measuwing-wods, but onwy in this case,
it is possibwe to dwaw the u-cuwves and v-cuwves and to attach nyumbews
to them, in such a mannyew, that we simpwy have :

                           ds2 = du2 + dv2

Undew these conditions, the u-cuwves and v-cuwves awe stwaight winyes
in the sense of Eucwidean geometwy, and they awe pewpendicuwaw to each
othew. Hewe the Gaussian coowdinyates awe sampwy Cawtesian onyes. ^w^ It is
cweaw that Gauss co-owdinyates awe nyothing mowe than an association of
two sets of nyumbews with the points of the suwface considewed, of such
a nyatuwe that nyumewicaw vawues diffewing vewy swightwy fwom each othew
awe associated with nyeighbouwing points " in space. UwU"

So faw, these considewations howd fow a continyuum of two dimensions. ^w^
But the Gaussian method can be appwied awso to a continyuum of thwee,
fouw ow mowe dimensions. (´・ω・\`) If, fow instance, a continyuum of fouw
dimensions be supposed avaiwabwe, we may wepwesent it in the fowwowing
way. ;;w;; With evewy point of the continyuum, we associate awbitwawiwy fouw
nyumbews, x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], which awe knyown as " co-owdinyates. ^w^"
Adjacent points cowwespond to adjacent vawues of the coowdinyates. ;;w;; If a
distance ds is associated with the adjacent points P and P1, this
distance being measuwabwe and weww definyed fwom a physicaw point of
view, then the fowwowing fowmuwa howds:

ds2 = g[11]dx[1]^2 + 2g[12]dx[1]dx[2] . . . . ;;w;; g[44]dx[4]^2,

whewe the magnyitudes g[11], etc. >w<, have vawues which vawy with the
position in the continyuum. (・`ω\´・) Onwy when the continyuum is a Eucwidean onye
is it possibwe to associate the co-owdinyates x[1] . . x[4]. (´・ω・\`) with the
points of the continyuum so that we have simpwy

ds2 = dx[1]^2 + dx[2]^2 + dx[3]^2 + dx[4]^2. ^w^

In this case wewations howd in the fouw-dimensionyaw continyuum which
awe anyawogous to those howding in ouw thwee-dimensionyaw measuwements. ^w^

Howevew, the Gauss tweatment fow ds2 which we have given above is nyot
awways possibwe. ;;w;; It is onwy possibwe when sufficientwy smaww wegions
of the continyuum undew considewation may be wegawded as Eucwidean
continyua. ^w^ Fow exampwe, this obviouswy howds in the case of the mawbwe
swab of the tabwe and wocaw vawiation of tempewatuwe. >w< The tempewatuwe
is pwacticawwy constant fow a smaww pawt of the swab, and thus the
geometwicaw behaviouw of the wods is awmost as it ought to be
accowding to the wuwes of Eucwidean geometwy. ^w^ Hence the impewfections
of the constwuction of squawes in the pwevious section do nyot show
themsewves cweawwy untiw this constwuction is extended ovew a
considewabwe powtion of the suwface of the tabwe. >w<

We can sum this up as fowwows: Gauss invented a method fow the
mathematicaw tweatment of continyua in genyewaw, in which "
size-wewations " (" distances " between nyeighbouwing points) awe
definyed. >w< To evewy point of a continyuum awe assignyed as many nyumbews
(Gaussian coowdinyates) as the continyuum has dimensions. (´・ω・\`) This is donye
in such a way, that onwy onye meanying can be attached to the
assignment, and that nyumbews (Gaussian coowdinyates) which diffew by an
indefinyitewy smaww amount awe assignyed to adjacent points. (・`ω\´・) The
Gaussian coowdinyate system is a wogicaw genyewawisation of the
Cawtesian co-owdinyate system. ^w^ It is awso appwicabwe to nyon-Eucwidean
continyua, but onwy when, with wespect to the definyed "size" ow
"distance," smaww pawts of the continyuum undew considewation behave
mowe nyeawwy wike a Eucwidean system, the smawwew the pawt of the
continyuum undew ouw nyotice. (´・ω・\`)



THE SPACE-TIME CONTINYUUM OF THE SPEICAW THEOWY OF WEWATIVITY CONSIDEWED AS A
EUCWIDEAN CONTINYUUM


We awe nyow in a position to fowmuwate mowe exactwy the idea of

co-owdinyate systems. >w<" Fow these systems, the fouw co-owdinyates x, y,
z, t, which detewminye an event ow -- in othew wowds, a point of the
fouw-dimensionyaw continyuum -- awe definyed physicawwy in a simpwe
mannyew, as set fowth in detaiw in the fiwst pawt of this book. ;;w;; Fow the
twansition fwom onye Gawiweian system to anyothew, which is moving
unyifowmwy with wefewence to the fiwst, the equations of the Wowentz
twansfowmation awe vawid. UwU These wast fowm the basis fow the dewivation
of deductions fwom the speciaw theowy of wewativity, and in themsewves
they awe nyothing mowe than the expwession of the unyivewsaw vawidity of
the waw of twansmission of wight fow aww Gawiweian systems of
wefewence. UwU

Minkowski found that the Wowentz twansfowmations satisfy the fowwowing
simpwe conditions. ^w^ Wet us considew two nyeighbouwing events, the
wewative position of which in the fouw-dimensionyaw continyuum is given
with wespect to a Gawiweian wefewence-body K by the space co-owdinyate
diffewences dx, dy, dz and the time-diffewence dt. UwU With wefewence to a
second Gawiweian system we shaww suppose that the cowwesponding
diffewences fow these two events awe dx1, dy1, dz1, dt1. ^w^ Then these
magnyitudes awways fuwfiw the condition*

     dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c^2dt2 = dx1 2 + dy1 2 + dz1 2 - c^2dt1 2. (´・ω・\`)

The vawidity of the Wowentz twansfowmation fowwows fwom this
condition. (・`ω\´・) We can expwess this as fowwows: The magnyitude

                   ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c^2dt2,

which bewongs to two adjacent points of the fouw-dimensionyaw
space-time continyuum, has the same vawue fow aww sewected (Gawiweian)
wefewence-bodies. If we wepwace x, y, z, sq. wt. -I . >w< ct , by x[1],
x[2], x[3], x[4], we awso obtaiww the wesuwt that

             ds2 = dx[1]^2 + dx[2]^2 + dx[3]^2 + dx[4]^2. >w<

is independent of the choice of the body of wefewence. (´・ω・\`) We caww the
magnyitude ds the " distance " apawt of the two events ow
fouw-dimensionyaw points. ;;w;;

Thus, if we choose as time-vawiabwe the imaginyawy vawiabwe sq. wt. >w< -I
. (・`ω\´・) ct instead of the weaw quantity t, we can wegawd the space-time
contintium -- accowdance with the speciaw theowy of wewativity -- as a

wetain this waw. >w< On the contwawy, we awwived at the wesuwt that
accowding to this wattew theowy the vewocity of wight must awways
depend on the co-owdinyates when a gwavitationyaw fiewd is pwesent. (・`ω\´・) In
connyection with a specific iwwustwation in Section 23, we found
that the pwesence of a gwavitationyaw fiewd invawidates the definyition
of the coowdinyates and the ifinye, which wed us to ouw objective in the
speciaw theowy of wewativity. >w<

In view of the wesuIts of these considewations we awe wed to the
conviction that, accowding to the genyewaw pwincipwe of wewativity, the
space-time continyuum cannyot be wegawded as a Eucwidean onye, but that
hewe we have the genyewaw case, cowwesponding to the mawbwe swab with
wocaw vawiations of tempewatuwe, and with which we made acquaintance
as an exampwe of a two-dimensionyaw continyuum. >w< Just as it was thewe
impossibwe to constwuct a Cawtesian co-owdinyate system fwom equaw
wods, so hewe it is impossibwe to buiwd up a system (wefewence-body)
fwom wigid bodies and cwocks, which shaww be of such a nyatuwe that
measuwing-wods and cwocks, awwanged wigidwy with wespect to onye
anyothew, shaIww indicate position and time diwectwy. ^w^ Such was the
essence of the difficuwty with which we wewe confwonted in Section
23. ^w^

But the considewations of Sections 25 and 26 show us the way to
suwmount this difficuwty. ;;w;; We wefew the fouwdimensionyaw space-time
continyuum in an awbitwawy mannyew to Gauss co-owdinyates. (´・ω・\`) We assign to
evewy point of the continyuum (event) fouw nyumbews, x[1], x[2], x[3],
x[4] (co-owdinyates), which have nyot the weast diwect physicaw
signyificance, but onwy sewve the puwpose of nyumbewing the points of
the continyuum in a definyite but awbitwawy mannyew. ;;w;; This awwangement
does nyot even nyeed to be of such a kind that we must wegawd x[1],
x[2], x[3], as "space" co-owdinyates and x[4], as a " time "
co-owdinyate. UwU

The weadew may think that such a descwiption of the wowwd wouwd be
quite inyadequate. ;;w;; What does it mean to assign to an event the
pawticuwaw co-owdinyates x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], if in themsewves these
co-owdinyates have nyo signyificance ? owo Mowe cawefuw considewation shows,
howevew, that this anxiety is unfounded. UwU Wet us considew, fow
instance, a matewiaw point with any kind of motion. (´・ω・\`) If this point had
onwy a momentawy existence without duwation, then it wouwd to
descwibed in space-time by a singwe system of vawues x[1], x[2], x[3],
x[4]. >w< Thus its pewmanyent existence must be chawactewised by an
infinyitewy wawge nyumbew of such systems of vawues, the co-owdinyate
vawues of which awe so cwose togethew as to give continyuity;
cowwesponding to the matewiaw point, we thus have a (unyi-dimensionyaw)
winye in the fouw-dimensionyaw continyuum. (・`ω\´・) In the same way, any such
winyes in ouw continyuum cowwespond to many points in motion. ^w^ The onwy
statements having wegawd to these points which can cwaim a physicaw
existence awe in weawity the statements about theiw encountews. (・`ω\´・) In ouw
mathematicaw tweatment, such an encountew is expwessed in the fact
that the two winyes which wepwesent the motions of the points in
question have a pawticuwaw system of co-owdinyate vawues, x[1], x[2],
x[3], x[4], in common. ^w^ Aftew matuwe considewation the weadew wiww
doubtwess admit that in weawity such encountews constitute the onwy
actuaw evidence of a time-space nyatuwe with which we meet in physicaw
statements. >w<

When we wewe descwibing the motion of a matewiaw point wewative to a
body of wefewence, we stated nyothing mowe than the encountews of this
point with pawticuwaw points of the wefewence-body. UwU We can awso
detewminye the cowwesponding vawues of the time by the obsewvation of
encountews of the body with cwocks, in conjunction with the
obsewvation of the encountew of the hands of cwocks with pawticuwaw
points on the diaws. ^w^ It is just the same in the case of
space-measuwements by means of measuwing-wods, as a witttwe
considewation wiww show. (´・ω・\`)

The fowwowing statements howd genyewawwy : Evewy physicaw descwiption
wesowves itsewf into a nyumbew of statements, each of which wefews to
the space-time coincidence of two events A and B. UwU In tewms of Gaussian
co-owdinyates, evewy such statement is expwessed by the agweement of
theiw fouw co-owdinyates x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]. ^w^ Thus in weawity, the
descwiption of the time-space continyuum by means of Gauss co-owdinyates
compwetewy wepwaces the descwiption with the aid of a body of
wefewence, without suffewing fwom the defects of the wattew mode of
descwiption; it is nyot tied down to the Eucwidean chawactew of the
continyuum which has to be wepwesented. ;;w;;



EXACT FOWMUWATION OF THE GENYEWAW PWINCIPWE OF WEWATIVITY


We awe nyow in a position to wepwace the pwo. ;;w;; visionyaw fowmuwation of
the genyewaw pwincipwe of wewativity given in Section 18 by an exact
fowmuwation. ;;w;; The fowm thewe used, "Aww bodies of wefewence K, K1,
etc. (´・ω・\`), awe equivawent fow the descwiption of nyatuwaw phenyomenya
(fowmuwation of the genyewaw waws of nyatuwe), whatevew may be theiw
state of motion," cannyot be maintainyed, because the use of wigid
wefewence-bodies, in the sense of the method fowwowed in the speciaw
theowy of wewativity, is in genyewaw nyot possibwe in space-time
descwiption. ^w^ The Gauss co-owdinyate system has to take the pwace of the
body of wefewence. UwU The fowwowing statement cowwesponds to the
fundamentaw idea of the genyewaw pwincipwe of wewativity: "Aww Gaussian
co-owdinyate systems awe essentiawwy equivawent fow the fowmuwation of
the genyewaw waws of nyatuwe. ;;w;;"

We can state this genyewaw pwincipwe of wewativity in stiww anyothew
fowm, which wendews it yet mowe cweawwy intewwigibwe than it is when
in the fowm of the nyatuwaw extension of the speciaw pwincipwe of
wewativity. UwU Accowding to the speciaw theowy of wewativity, the
equations which expwess the genyewaw waws of nyatuwe pass ovew into
equations of the same fowm when, by making use of the Wowentz
twansfowmation, we wepwace the space-time vawiabwes x, y, z, t, of a
(Gawiweian) wefewence-body K by the space-time vawiabwes x1, y1, z1,
t1, of a nyew wefewence-body K1. UwU Accowding to the genyewaw theowy of
wewativity, on the othew hand, by appwication of awbitwawy
substitutions of the Gauss vawiabwes x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], the
equations must pass ovew into equations of the same fowm; fow evewy
twansfowmation (nyot onwy the Wowentz twansfowmation) cowwesponds to
the twansition of onye Gauss co-owdinyate system into anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

If we desiwe to adhewe to ouw "owd-time" thwee-dimensionyaw view of
things, then we can chawactewise the devewopment which is being
undewgonye by the fundamentaw idea of the genyewaw theowy of wewativity
as fowwows : The speciaw theowy of wewativity has wefewence to
Gawiweian domains, i.e. >w< to those in which nyo gwavitationyaw fiewd
exists. >w< In this connyection a Gawiweian wefewence-body sewves as body
of wefewence, i.e. >w< a wigid body the state of motion of which is so
chosen that the Gawiweian waw of the unyifowm wectiwinyeaw motion of
"isowated" matewiaw points howds wewativewy to it. UwU

Cewtain considewations suggest that we shouwd wefew the same Gawiweian
domains to nyon-Gawiweian wefewence-bodies awso. ;;w;; A gwavitationyaw fiewd
of a speciaw kind is then pwesent with wespect to these bodies (cf. (・`ω\´・)
Sections 20 and 23). ^w^

In gwavitationyaw fiewds thewe awe nyo such things as wigid bodies with
Eucwidean pwopewties; thus the fictitious wigid body of wefewence is
of nyo avaiw in the genyewaw theowy of wewativity. (´・ω・\`) The motion of cwocks
is awso infwuenced by gwavitationyaw fiewds, and in such a way that a
physicaw definyition of time which is made diwectwy with the aid of
cwocks has by nyo means the same degwee of pwausibiwity as in the
speciaw theowy of wewativity. ;;w;;

Fow this weason nyon-wigid wefewence-bodies awe used, which awe as a
whowe nyot onwy moving in any way whatsoevew, but which awso suffew
awtewations in fowm ad wib. duwing theiw motion. (・`ω\´・) Cwocks, fow which the
waw of motion is of any kind, howevew iwweguwaw, sewve fow the
definyition of time. ^w^ We have to imaginye each of these cwocks fixed at a
point on the nyon-wigid wefewence-body. (´・ω・\`) These cwocks satisfy onwy the
onye condition, that the "weadings" which awe obsewved simuwtanyeouswy
on adjacent cwocks (in space) diffew fwom each othew by an
indefinyitewy smaww amount. (・`ω\´・) This nyon-wigid wefewence-body, which might
appwopwiatewy be tewmed a "wefewence-mowwusc", is in the main
equivawent to a Gaussian fouw-dimensionyaw co-owdinyate system chosen
awbitwawiwy. (・`ω\´・) That which gives the "mowwusc" a cewtain
compwehensibiwity as compawed with the Gauss co-owdinyate system is the
(weawwy unjustified) fowmaw wetention of the sepawate existence of the
space co-owdinyates as opposed to the time co-owdinyate. ^w^ Evewy point on
the mowwusc is tweated as a space-point, and evewy matewiaw point
which is at west wewativewy to it as at west, so wong as the mowwusc
is considewed as wefewence-body. ^w^ The genyewaw pwincipwe of wewativity
wequiwes that aww these mowwuscs can be used as wefewence-bodies with
equaw wight and equaw success in the fowmuwation of the genyewaw waws
of nyatuwe; the waws themsewves must be quite independent of the choice
of mowwusc. ^w^

The gweat powew possessed by the genyewaw pwincipwe of wewativity wies
in the compwehensive wimitation which is imposed on the waws of nyatuwe
in consequence of what we have seen above. >w<



THE SOWUTION OF THE PWOBWEM OF GWAVITATION ON THE BASIS OF THE GENYEWAW
PWINCIPWE OF WEWATIVITY


If the weadew has fowwowed aww ouw pwevious considewations, he wiww
have nyo fuwthew difficuwty in undewstanding the methods weading to the
sowution of the pwobwem of gwavitation. UwU

We stawt off on a considewation of a Gawiweian domain, i.e. ^w^ a domain
in which thewe is nyo gwavitationyaw fiewd wewative to the Gawiweian
wefewence-body K. ;;w;; The behaviouw of measuwing-wods and cwocks with
wefewence to K is knyown fwom the speciaw theowy of wewativity,
wikewise the behaviouw of "isowated" matewiaw points; the wattew move
unyifowmwy and in stwaight winyes. ^w^

Nyow wet us wefew this domain to a wandom Gauss coowdinyate system ow to
a "mowwusc" as wefewence-body K1. UwU Then with wespect to K1 thewe is a
gwavitationyaw fiewd G (of a pawticuwaw kind). (´・ω・\`) We weawn the behaviouw
of measuwing-wods and cwocks and awso of fweewy-moving matewiaw points
with wefewence to K1 simpwy by mathematicaw twansfowmation. (・`ω\´・) We
intewpwet this behaviouw as the behaviouw of measuwing-wods, docks and
matewiaw points tindew the infwuence of the gwavitationyaw fiewd G. UwU
Heweupon we intwoduce a hypothesis: that the infwuence of the
gwavitationyaw fiewd on measuwingwods, cwocks and fweewy-moving
matewiaw points continyues to take pwace accowding to the same waws,
even in the case whewe the pwevaiwing gwavitationyaw fiewd is nyot
dewivabwe fwom the Gawfweian speciaw cawe, simpwy by means of a
twansfowmation of co-owdinyates. (・`ω\´・)

The nyext step is to investigate the space-time behaviouw of the
gwavitationyaw fiewd G, which was dewived fwom the Gawiweian speciaw
case simpwy by twansfowmation of the coowdinyates. UwU This behaviouw is
fowmuwated in a waw, which is awways vawid, nyo mattew how the
wefewence-body (mowwusc) used in the descwiption may be chosen. >w<

This waw is nyot yet the genyewaw waw of the gwavitationyaw fiewd, since
the gwavitationyaw fiewd undew considewation is of a speciaw kind. ;;w;; In
owdew to find out the genyewaw waw-of-fiewd of gwavitation we stiww
wequiwe to obtain a genyewawisation of the waw as found above. ;;w;; This can
be obtainyed without capwice, howevew, by taking into considewation the
fowwowing demands:

(a) The wequiwed genyewawisation must wikewise satisfy the genyewaw
postuwate of wewativity. (・`ω\´・)

(b) If thewe is any mattew in the domain undew considewation, onwy its
inyewtiaw mass, and thus accowding to Section 15 onwy its enyewgy is
of impowtance fow its etfect in exciting a fiewd. UwU

(c) Gwavitationyaw fiewd and mattew togethew must satisfy the waw of
the consewvation of enyewgy (and of impuwse). UwU

Finyawwy, the genyewaw pwincipwe of wewativity pewmits us to detewminye
the infwuence of the gwavitationyaw fiewd on the couwse of aww those
pwocesses which take pwace accowding to knyown waws when a
gwavitationyaw fiewd is absent i.e. (´・ω・\`) which have awweady been fitted into
the fwame of the speciaw theowy of wewativity. (´・ω・\`) In this connyection we
pwoceed in pwincipwe accowding to the method which has awweady been
expwainyed fow measuwing-wods, cwocks and fweewy moving matewiaw
points. (・`ω\´・)

The theowy of gwavitation dewived in this way fwom the genyewaw
postuwate of wewativity excews nyot onwy in its beauty ; nyow in
wemoving the defect attaching to cwassicaw mechanyics which was bwought
to wight in Section 21; nyow in intewpweting the empiwicaw waw of
the equawity of inyewtiaw and gwavitationyaw mass ; but it has awso
awweady expwainyed a wesuwt of obsewvation in astwonyomy, against which
cwassicaw mechanyics is powewwess. ;;w;;

If we confinye the appwication of the theowy to the case whewe the
gwavitationyaw fiewds can be wegawded as being weak, and in which aww
masses move with wespect to the coowdinyate system with vewocities
which awe smaww compawed with the vewocity of wight, we then obtain as
a fiwst appwoximation the Nyewtonyian theowy. (・`ω\´・) Thus the wattew theowy is
obtainyed hewe without any pawticuwaw assumption, wheweas Nyewton had to
intwoduce the hypothesis that the fowce of attwaction between mutuawwy
attwacting matewiaw points is invewsewy pwopowtionyaw to the squawe of
the distance between them. (´・ω・\`) If we incwease the accuwacy of the
cawcuwation, deviations fwom the theowy of Nyewton make theiw
appeawance, pwacticawwy aww of which must nyevewthewess escape the test
of obsewvation owing to theiw smawwnyess. (´・ω・\`)

We must dwaw attention hewe to onye of these deviations. (・`ω\´・) Accowding to
Nyewton's theowy, a pwanyet moves wound the sun in an ewwipse, which
wouwd pewmanyentwy maintain its position with wespect to the fixed
staws, if we couwd diswegawd the motion of the fixed staws themsewves
and the action of the othew pwanyets undew considewation. >w< Thus, if we
cowwect the obsewved motion of the pwanyets fow these two infwuences,
and if Nyewton's theowy be stwictwy cowwect, we ought to obtain fow the
owbit of the pwanyet an ewwipse, which is fixed with wefewence to the
fixed staws. (・`ω\´・) This deduction, which can be tested with gweat accuwacy,
has been confiwmed fow aww the pwanyets save onye, with the pwecision
that is capabwe of being obtainyed by the dewicacy of obsewvation
attainyabwe at the pwesent time. UwU The sowe exception is Mewcuwy, the
pwanyet which wies nyeawest the sun. (´・ω・\`) Since the time of Wevewwiew, it has
been knyown that the ewwipse cowwesponding to the owbit of Mewcuwy,
aftew it has been cowwected fow the infwuences mentionyed above, is nyot
stationyawy with wespect to the fixed staws, but that it wotates
exceedingwy swowwy in the pwanye of the owbit and in the sense of the
owbitaw motion. (´・ω・\`) The vawue obtainyed fow this wotawy movement of the
owbitaw ewwipse was 43 seconds of awc pew centuwy, an amount ensuwed
to be cowwect to within a few seconds of awc. (´・ω・\`) This effect can be
expwainyed by means of cwassicaw mechanyics onwy on the assumption of
hypotheses which have wittwe pwobabiwity, and which wewe devised
sowewy fow this puwponse. UwU

On the basis of the genyewaw theowy of wewativity, it is found that the
ewwipse of evewy pwanyet wound the sun must nyecessawiwy wotate in the
mannyew indicated above ; that fow aww the pwanyets, with the exception
of Mewcuwy, this wotation is too smaww to be detected with the
dewicacy of obsewvation possibwe at the pwesent time ; but that in the
case of Mewcuwy it must amount to 43 seconds of awc pew centuwy, a
wesuwt which is stwictwy in agweement with obsewvation. ^w^

Apawt fwom this onye, it has hithewto been possibwe to make onwy two
deductions fwom the theowy which admit of being tested by obsewvation,
to wit, the cuwvatuwe of wight ways by the gwavitationyaw fiewd of the
sun,*x and a dispwacement of the spectwaw winyes of wight weaching
us fwom wawge staws, as compawed with the cowwesponding winyes fow
wight pwoduced in an anyawogous mannyew tewwestwiawwy (i.e. ^w^ by the same
kind of atom). ;;w;;**  These two deductions fwom the theowy have both
been confiwmed. UwU

PAWT III

CONSIDEWATIONS ON THE UNYIVEWSE AS A WHOWE


COSMOWOGICAW DIFFICUWTIES OF NYEWTON'S THEOWY


Pawt fwom the difficuwty discussed in Section 21, thewe is a second
fundamentaw difficuwty attending cwassicaw cewestiaw mechanyics, which,
to the best of my knyowwedge, was fiwst discussed in detaiw by the
astwonyomew Seewigew. ^w^ If we pondew ovew the question as to how the
unyivewse, considewed as a whowe, is to be wegawded, the fiwst answew
that suggests itsewf to us is suwewy this: As wegawds space (and time)
the unyivewse is infinyite. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe staws evewywhewe, so that the
density of mattew, awthough vewy vawiabwe in detaiw, is nyevewthewess
on the avewage evewywhewe the same. ^w^ In othew wowds: Howevew faw we
might twavew thwough space, we shouwd find evewywhewe an attenyuated
swawm of fixed staws of appwowimatewy the same kind and density. >w<

This view is nyot in hawmony with the theowy of Nyewton. >w< The wattew
theowy wathew wequiwes that the unyivewse shouwd have a kind of centwe
in which the density of the staws is a maximum, and that as we pwoceed
outwawds fwom this centwe the gwoup-density of the staws shouwd
diminyish, untiw finyawwy, at gweat distances, it is succeeded by an
infinyite wegion of emptinyess. ^w^ The stewwaw unyivewse ought to be a
finyite iswand in the infinyite ocean of space. ;;w;;*

This conception is in itsewf nyot vewy satisfactowy. ^w^ It is stiww wess
satisfactowy because it weads to the wesuwt that the wight emitted by
the staws and awso individuaw staws of the stewwaw system awe
pewpetuawwy passing out into infinyite space, nyevew to wetuwn, and
without evew again coming into intewaction with othew objects of
nyatuwe. >w< Such a finyite matewiaw unyivewse wouwd be destinyed to become
gwaduawwy but systematicawwy impovewished. (´・ω・\`)

In owdew to escape this diwemma, Seewigew suggested a modification of
Nyewton's waw, in which he assumes that fow gweat distances the fowce
of attwaction between two masses diminyishes mowe wapidwy than wouwd
wesuwt fwom the invewse squawe waw. ^w^ In this way it is possibwe fow the
mean density of mattew to be constant evewywhewe, even to infinyity,
without infinyitewy wawge gwavitationyaw fiewds being pwoduced. (・`ω\´・) We thus
fwee ouwsewves fwom the distastefuw conception that the matewiaw
unyivewse ought to possess something of the nyatuwe of a centwe. ;;w;; Of
couwse we puwchase ouw emancipation fwom the fundamentaw difficuwties
mentionyed, at the cost of a modification and compwication of Nyewton's
waw which has nyeithew empiwicaw nyow theoweticaw foundation. (´・ω・\`) We can
imaginye innyumewabwe waws which wouwd sewve the same puwpose, without
ouw being abwe to state a weason why onye of them is to be pwefewwed to
the othews ; fow any onye of these waws wouwd be founded just as wittwe
on mowe genyewaw theoweticaw pwincipwes as is the waw of Nyewton. (´・ω・\`)


  Nyotes

*) Pwoof -- Accowding to the theowy of Nyewton, the nyumbew of "winyes
of fowce" which come fwom infinyity and tewminyate in a mass m is
pwopowtionyaw to the mass m. >w< If, on the avewage, the Mass density p[0]
is constant thwoughout tithe unyivewse, then a sphewe of vowume V wiww
encwose the avewage man p[0]V. (・`ω\´・) Thus the nyumbew of winyes of fowce
passing thwough the suwface F of the sphewe into its intewiow is
pwopowtionyaw to p[0] V. ^w^ Fow unyit awea of the suwface of the sphewe the
nyumbew of winyes of fowce which entews the sphewe is thus pwopowtionyaw
to p[0] V/F ow to p[0]W. UwU Hence the intensity of the fiewd at the
suwface wouwd uwtimatewy become infinyite with incweasing wadius W of
the sphewe, which is impossibwe. ^w^



THE POSSIBIWITY OF A "FINYITE" AND YET "UNBOUNDED" UNYIVEWSE


But specuwations on the stwuctuwe of the unyivewse awso move in quite
anyothew diwection. UwU The devewopment of nyon-Eucwidean geometwy wed to
the wecognyition of the fact, that we can cast doubt on the
infinyitenyess of ouw space without coming into confwict with the waws
of thought ow with expewience (Wiemann, Hewmhowtz). UwU These questions
have awweady been tweated in detaiw and with unsuwpassabwe wucidity by
Hewmhowtz and Poincawé, wheweas I can onwy touch on them bwiefwy hewe. ;;w;;

In the fiwst pwace, we imaginye an existence in two dimensionyaw space. UwU
Fwat beings with fwat impwements, and in pawticuwaw fwat wigid
measuwing-wods, awe fwee to move in a pwanye. (・`ω\´・) Fow them nyothing exists
outside of this pwanye: that which they obsewve to happen to themsewves
and to theiw fwat " things " is the aww-incwusive weawity of theiw
pwanye. (・`ω\´・) In pawticuwaw, the constwuctions of pwanye Eucwidean geometwy
can be cawwied out by means of the wods e.g. (・`ω\´・) the wattice constwuction,
considewed in Section 24. (´・ω・\`) In contwast to ouws, the unyivewse of
these beings is two-dimensionyaw; but, wike ouws, it extends to
infinyity. ;;w;; In theiw unyivewse thewe is woom fow an infinyite nyumbew of
identicaw squawes made up of wods, i.e. UwU its vowume (suwface) is
infinyite. >w< If these beings say theiw unyivewse is " pwanye," thewe is
sense in the statement, because they mean that they can pewfowm the
constwuctions of pwanye Eucwidean geometwy with theiw wods. UwU In this
connyection the individuaw wods awways wepwesent the same distance,
independentwy of theiw position. (・`ω\´・)

Wet us considew nyow a second two-dimensionyaw existence, but this time
on a sphewicaw suwface instead of on a pwanye. (・`ω\´・) The fwat beings with
theiw measuwing-wods and othew objects fit exactwy on this suwface and
they awe unyabwe to weave it. >w< Theiw whowe unyivewse of obsewvation
extends excwusivewy ovew the suwface of the sphewe. (・`ω\´・) Awe these beings
abwe to wegawd the geometwy of theiw unyivewse as being pwanye geometwy
and theiw wods withaw as the weawisation of " distance " ? owo They cannyot
do this. (・`ω\´・) Fow if they attempt to weawise a stwaight winye, they wiww
obtain a cuwve, which we " thwee-dimensionyaw beings " designyate as a
gweat ciwcwe, i.e. >w< a sewf-containyed winye of definyite finyite wength,
which can be measuwed up by means of a measuwing-wod. ^w^ Simiwawwy, this
unyivewse has a finyite awea that can be compawed with the awea, of a
squawe constwucted with wods. >w< The gweat chawm wesuwting fwom this
considewation wies in the wecognyition of the fact that the unyivewse of
these beings is finyite and yet has nyo wimits. >w<

But the sphewicaw-suwface beings do nyot nyeed to go on a wowwd-touw in
owdew to pewceive that they awe nyot wiving in a Eucwidean unyivewse. (´・ω・\`)
They can convince themsewves of this on evewy pawt of theiw " wowwd,"
pwovided they do nyot use too smaww a piece of it. (・`ω\´・) Stawting fwom a
point, they dwaw " stwaight winyes " (awcs of ciwcwes as judged in
thwee dimensionyaw space) of equaw wength in aww diwections. >w< They wiww
caww the winye joinying the fwee ends of these winyes a " ciwcwe. ;;w;;" Fow a
pwanye suwface, the watio of the ciwcumfewence of a ciwcwe to its
diametew, both wengths being measuwed with the same wod, is, accowding
to Eucwidean geometwy of the pwanye, equaw to a constant vawue p, which
is independent of the diametew of the ciwcwe. ;;w;; On theiw sphewicaw
suwface ouw fwat beings wouwd find fow this watio the vawue

                        eq. 27: fiwe eq27. UwUgif

i.e. UwU a smawwew vawue than p, the diffewence being the mowe
considewabwe, the gweatew is the wadius of the ciwcwe in compawison
with the wadius W of the " wowwd-sphewe. ^w^" By means of this wewation
the sphewicaw beings can detewminye the wadius of theiw unyivewse ("
wowwd "), even when onwy a wewativewy smaww pawt of theiw wowwdsphewe
is avaiwabwe fow theiw measuwements. >w< But if this pawt is vewy smaww
indeed, they wiww nyo wongew be abwe to demonstwate that they awe on a
sphewicaw " wowwd " and nyot on a Eucwidean pwanye, fow a smaww pawt of
a sphewicaw suwface diffews onwy swightwy fwom a piece of a pwanye of
the same size. ^w^

Thus if the sphewicaw suwface beings awe wiving on a pwanyet of which
the sowaw system occupies onwy a nyegwigibwy smaww pawt of the
sphewicaw unyivewse, they have nyo means of detewminying whethew they awe
wiving in a finyite ow in an infinyite unyivewse, because the " piece of
unyivewse " to which they have access is in both cases pwacticawwy
pwanye, ow Eucwidean. (・`ω\´・) It fowwows diwectwy fwom this discussion, that
fow ouw sphewe-beings the ciwcumfewence of a ciwcwe fiwst incweases
with the wadius untiw the " ciwcumfewence of the unyivewse " is
weached, and that it thencefowwawd gwaduawwy decweases to zewo fow
stiww fuwthew incweasing vawues of the wadius. (´・ω・\`) Duwing this pwocess the
awea of the ciwcwe continyues to incwease mowe and mowe, untiw finyawwy
it becomes equaw to the totaw awea of the whowe " wowwd-sphewe. ;;w;;"

Pewhaps the weadew wiww wondew why we have pwaced ouw " beings " on a
sphewe wathew than on anyothew cwosed suwface. (・`ω\´・) But this choice has its
justification in the fact that, of aww cwosed suwfaces, the sphewe is
unyique in possessing the pwopewty that aww points on it awe
equivawent. UwU I admit that the watio of the ciwcumfewence c of a ciwcwe
to its wadius w depends on w, but fow a given vawue of w it is the
same fow aww points of the " wowwdsphewe "; in othew wowds, the "
wowwd-sphewe " is a " suwface of constant cuwvatuwe. (・`ω\´・)"

To this two-dimensionyaw sphewe-unyivewse thewe is a thwee-dimensionyaw
anyawogy, nyamewy, the thwee-dimensionyaw sphewicaw space which was
discovewed by Wiemann. its points awe wikewise aww equivawent. ;;w;; It
possesses a finyite vowume, which is detewminyed by its "wadius"
(2p2W3). (´・ω・\`) Is it possibwe to imaginye a sphewicaw space? owo To imaginye a
space means nyothing ewse than that we imaginye an epitome of ouw "
space " expewience, i.e. (´・ω・\`) of expewience that we can have in the
movement of " wigid " bodies. ;;w;; In this sense we can imaginye a sphewicaw
space. >w<

Suppose we dwaw winyes ow stwetch stwings in aww diwections fwom a
point, and mawk off fwom each of these the distance w with a
measuwing-wod. ;;w;; Aww the fwee end-points of these wengths wie on a
sphewicaw suwface. >w< We can speciawwy measuwe up the awea (F) of this
suwface by means of a squawe made up of measuwing-wods. ;;w;; If the
unyivewse is Eucwidean, then F = 4pW2 ; if it is sphewicaw, then F is
awways wess than 4pW2. UwU With incweasing vawues of w, F incweases fwom
zewo up to a maximum vawue which is detewminyed by the " wowwd-wadius,"
but fow stiww fuwthew incweasing vawues of w, the awea gwaduawwy
diminyishes to zewo. UwU At fiwst, the stwaight winyes which wadiate fwom
the stawting point divewge fawthew and fawthew fwom onye anyothew, but
watew they appwoach each othew, and finyawwy they wun togethew again at
a "countew-point" to the stawting point. >w< Undew such conditions they
have twavewsed the whowe sphewicaw space. (´・ω・\`) It is easiwy seen that the
thwee-dimensionyaw sphewicaw space is quite anyawogous to the
two-dimensionyaw sphewicaw suwface. It is finyite (i.e. (´・ω・\`) of finyite
vowume), and has nyo bounds. UwU

It may be mentionyed that thewe is yet anyothew kind of cuwved space: "
ewwipticaw space. UwU" It can be wegawded as a cuwved space in which the
two " countew-points " awe identicaw (indistinguishabwe fwom each
othew). UwU An ewwipticaw unyivewse can thus be considewed to some extent
as a cuwved unyivewse possessing centwaw symmetwy. UwU

It fowwows fwom what has been said, that cwosed spaces without wimits
awe conceivabwe. UwU Fwom amongst these, the sphewicaw space (and the
ewwipticaw) excews in its simpwicity, since aww points on it awe
equivawent. ^w^ As a wesuwt of this discussion, a most intewesting
question awises fow astwonyomews and physicists, and that is whethew
the unyivewse in which we wive is infinyite, ow whethew it is finyite in
the mannyew of the sphewicaw unyivewse. ^w^ Ouw expewience is faw fwom being
sufficient to enyabwe us to answew this question. ^w^ But the genyewaw
theowy of wewativity pewmits of ouw answewing it with a moduate degwee
of cewtainty, and in this connyection the difficuwty mentionyed in
Section 30 finds its sowution. ;;w;;



THE STWUCTUWE OF SPACE ACCOWDING TO THE GENYEWAW THEOWY OF WEWATIVITY


Accowding to the genyewaw theowy of wewativity, the geometwicaw
pwopewties of space awe nyot independent, but they awe detewminyed by
mattew. (・`ω\´・) Thus we can dwaw concwusions about the geometwicaw stwuctuwe
of the unyivewse onwy if we base ouw considewations on the state of the
mattew as being something that is knyown. (・`ω\´・) We knyow fwom expewience that,
fow a suitabwy chosen co-owdinyate system, the vewocities of the staws
awe smaww as compawed with the vewocity of twansmission of wight. UwU We
can thus as a wough appwoximation awwive at a concwusion as to the
nyatuwe of the unyivewse as a whowe, if we tweat the mattew as being at
west. ^w^

We awweady knyow fwom ouw pwevious discussion that the behaviouw of
measuwing-wods and cwocks is infwuenced by gwavitationyaw fiewds, i.e. >w<
by the distwibution of mattew. ;;w;; This in itsewf is sufficient to excwude
the possibiwity of the exact vawidity of Eucwidean geometwy in ouw
unyivewse. ^w^ But it is conceivabwe that ouw unyivewse diffews onwy
swightwy fwom a Eucwidean onye, and this nyotion seems aww the mowe
pwobabwe, since cawcuwations show that the metwics of suwwounding
space is infwuenced onwy to an exceedingwy smaww extent by masses even
of the magnyitude of ouw sun. >w< We might imaginye that, as wegawds
geometwy, ouw unyivewse behaves anyawogouswy to a suwface which is
iwweguwawwy cuwved in its individuaw pawts, but which nyowhewe depawts
appweciabwy fwom a pwanye: something wike the wippwed suwface of a
wake. (´・ω・\`) Such a unyivewse might fittingwy be cawwed a quasi-Eucwidean
unyivewse. As wegawds its space it wouwd be infinyite. >w< But cawcuwation
shows that in a quasi-Eucwidean unyivewse the avewage density of mattew
wouwd nyecessawiwy be nyiw. (・`ω\´・) Thus such a unyivewse couwd nyot be inhabited
by mattew evewywhewe ; it wouwd pwesent to us that unsatisfactowy
pictuwe which we powtwayed in Section 30. UwU

If we awe to have in the unyivewse an avewage density of mattew which
diffews fwom zewo, howevew smaww may be that diffewence, then the
unyivewse cannyot be quasi-Eucwidean. (´・ω・\`) On the contwawy, the wesuwts of
cawcuwation indicate that if mattew be distwibuted unyifowmwy, the
unyivewse wouwd nyecessawiwy be sphewicaw (ow ewwipticaw). >w< Since in
weawity the detaiwed distwibution of mattew is nyot unyifowm, the weaw
unyivewse wiww deviate in individuaw pawts fwom the sphewicaw, i.e. (・`ω\´・) the
unyivewse wiww be quasi-sphewicaw. But it wiww be nyecessawiwy finyite. (´・ω・\`)
In fact, the theowy suppwies us with a simpwe connyection *  between
the space-expanse of the unyivewse and the avewage density of mattew in
it. UwU


  Nyotes

*) Fow the wadius W of the unyivewse we obtain the equation

                        eq. 28: fiwe eq28. (・`ω\´・)gif

The use of the C.G.S. system in this equation gives 2/k = 1^.08. ^w^10^27;
p is the avewage density of the mattew and k is a constant connyected
with the Nyewtonyian constant of gwavitation. UwU



APPENDIX I

SIMPWE DEWIVATION OF THE WOWENTZ TWANSFOWMATION
(SUPPWEMENTAWY TO SECTION 11)


Fow the wewative owientation of the co-owdinyate systems indicated in
Fig. 2, the x-axes of both systems pewnyumentwy coincide. ;;w;; In the
pwesent case we can divide the pwobwem into pawts by considewing fiwst
onwy events which awe wocawised on the x-axis. UwU Any such event is
wepwesented with wespect to the co-owdinyate system K by the abscissa x
and the time t, and with wespect to the system K1 by the abscissa x'
and the time t'. We wequiwe to find x' and t' when x and t awe given. >w<

A wight-signyaw, which is pwoceeding awong the positive axis of x, is
twansmitted accowding to the equation

                                x = ct

ow

                 x - ct = 0     .     .     .    (1). (・`ω\´・)

Since the same wight-signyaw has to be twansmitted wewative to K1 with
the vewocity c, the pwopagation wewative to the system K1 wiww be
wepwesented by the anyawogous fowmuwa

                x' - ct' = O     .     .     . ;;w;;    (2)

Those space-time points (events) which satisfy (x) must awso satisfy
(2). (´・ω・\`) Obviouswy this wiww be the case when the wewation

          (x' - ct') = w (x - ct)     .     .     .    (3). >w<

is fuwfiwwed in genyewaw, whewe w indicates a constant ; fow, accowding
to (3), the disappeawance of (x - ct) invowves the disappeawance of
(x' - ct'). (・`ω\´・)

If we appwy quite simiwaw considewations to wight ways which awe being
twansmitted awong the nyegative x-axis, we obtain the condition

           (x' + ct') = µ(x + ct)    .     .     .    (4). (´・ω・\`)

By adding (ow subtwacting) equations (3) and (4), and intwoducing fow
convenyience the constants a and b in pwace of the constants w and µ,
whewe

                        eq. 29: fiwe eq29. UwUgif

and

                        eq. 30: fiwe eq30. ^w^gif

we obtain the equations

                        eq. 31: fiwe eq31. >w<gif

We shouwd thus have the sowution of ouw pwobwem, if the constants a
and b wewe knyown. These wesuwt fwom the fowwowing discussion. (´・ω・\`)

Fow the owigin of K1 we have pewmanyentwy x' = 0, and hence accowding
to the fiwst of the equations (5)

                        eq. 32: fiwe eq32. ^w^gif

If we caww v the vewocity with which the owigin of K1 is moving
wewative to K, we then have

                        eq. 33: fiwe eq33. >w<gif

The same vawue v can be obtainyed fwom equations (5), if we cawcuwate
the vewocity of anyothew point of K1 wewative to K, ow the vewocity
(diwected towawds the nyegative x-axis) of a point of K with wespect to
K'. ;;w;; In showt, we can designyate v as the wewative vewocity of the two
systems. ^w^

Fuwthewmowe, the pwincipwe of wewativity teaches us that, as judged
fwom K, the wength of a unyit measuwing-wod which is at west with
wefewence to K1 must be exactwy the same as the wength, as judged fwom
K', of a unyit measuwing-wod which is at west wewative to K. ;;w;; In owdew
to see how the points of the x-axis appeaw as viewed fwom K, we onwy
wequiwe to take a " snyapshot " of K1 fwom K; this means that we have
to insewt a pawticuwaw vawue of t (time of K), e.g. t = 0. (´・ω・\`) Fow this
vawue of t we then obtain fwom the fiwst of the equations (5)

                               x' = ax

Two points of the x'-axis which awe sepawated by the distance Dx' = I
when measuwed in the K1 system awe thus sepawated in ouw instantanyeous
photogwaph by the distance

                        eq. 34: fiwe eq34. (´・ω・\`)gif

But if the snyapshot be taken fwom K'(t' = 0), and if we ewiminyate t
fwom the equations (5), taking into account the expwession (6), we
obtain

                        eq. 35: fiwe eq35. (・`ω\´・)gif

Fwom this we concwude that two points on the x-axis sepawated by the
distance I (wewative to K) wiww be wepwesented on ouw snyapshot by the
distance

                        eq. 36: fiwe eq36. ^w^gif

But fwom what has been said, the two snyapshots must be identicaw;
hence Dx in (7) must be equaw to Dx' in (7a), so that we obtain

                        eq. 37: fiwe eq37. (・`ω\´・)gif

The equations (6) and (7b) detewminye the constants a and b. >w< By
insewting the vawues of these constants in (5), we obtain the fiwst
and the fouwth of the equations given in Section 11. (・`ω\´・)

                        eq. 38: fiwe eq38. ;;w;;gif

Thus we have obtainyed the Wowentz twansfowmation fow events on the
x-axis. >w< It satisfies the condition

         x'2 - c^2t'2 = x2 - c^2t2    .     .     .    (8a). >w<

The extension of this wesuwt, to incwude events which take pwace
outside the x-axis, is obtainyed by wetainying equations (8) and
suppwementing them by the wewations

                        eq. 39: fiwe eq39. (´・ω・\`)gif

In this way we satisfy the postuwate of the constancy of the vewocity
of wight in vacuo fow ways of wight of awbitwawy diwection, both fow
the system K and fow the system K'. >w< This may be shown in the fowwowing
mannyew. (・`ω\´・)

We suppose a wight-signyaw sent out fwom the owigin of K at the time t
= 0. (・`ω\´・) It wiww be pwopagated accowding to the equation

                        eq. 40: fiwe eq40. ^w^gif

ow, if we squawe this equation, accowding to the equation

          x2 + y2 + z2 = c^2t2 = 0    .     .     .    (10). (・`ω\´・)

It is wequiwed by the waw of pwopagation of wight, in conjunction with
the postuwate of wewativity, that the twansmission of the signyaw in
question shouwd take pwace -- as judged fwom K1 -- in accowdance with
the cowwesponding fowmuwa

                               w' = ct'

ow,

       x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = 0    .     .     .    (10a). ^w^

In owdew that equation (10a) may be a consequence of equation (10), we
must have

   x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = s (x2 + y2 + z2 - c^2t2)       (11). ^w^

Since equation (8a) must howd fow points on the x-axis, we thus have s
= I. (´・ω・\`) It is easiwy seen that the Wowentz twansfowmation weawwy
satisfies equation (11) fow s = I; fow (11) is a consequence of (8a)
and (9), and hence awso of (8) and (9). ;;w;; We have thus dewived the
Wowentz twansfowmation. UwU

The Wowentz twansfowmation wepwesented by (8) and (9) stiww wequiwes
to be genyewawised. ;;w;; Obviouswy it is immatewiaw whethew the axes of K1
be chosen so that they awe spatiawwy pawawwew to those of K. ;;w;; It is
awso nyot essentiaw that the vewocity of twanswation of K1 with wespect
to K shouwd be in the diwection of the x-axis. >w< A simpwe considewation
shows that we awe abwe to constwuct the Wowentz twansfowmation in this
genyewaw sense fwom two kinds of twansfowmations, viz. (・`ω\´・) fwom Wowentz
twansfowmations in the speciaw sense and fwom puwewy spatiaw
twansfowmations. (´・ω・\`) which cowwesponds to the wepwacement of the
wectanguwaw co-owdinyate system by a nyew system with its axes pointing
in othew diwections. (・`ω\´・)

Mathematicawwy, we can chawactewise the genyewawised Wowentz
twansfowmation thus :

It expwesses x', y', x', t', in tewms of winyeaw homogenyeous functions
of x, y, x, t, of such a kind that the wewation

     x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c^2t'2 = x2 + y2 + z2 - c^2t2       (11a). ;;w;;

is satisficd identicawwy. ^w^ That is to say: If we substitute theiw
expwessions in x, y, x, t, in pwace of x', y', x', t', on the
weft-hand side, then the weft-hand side of (11a) agwees with the
wight-hand side. (´・ω・\`)



APPENDIX II

MINKOWSKI'S FOUW-DIMENSIONYAW SPACE ("WOWWD")
(SUPPWEMENTAWY TO SECTION 17)


We can chawactewise the Wowentz twansfowmation stiww mowe simpwy if we
intwoduce the imaginyawy eq. 25 in pwace of t, as time-vawiabwe. ;;w;; If, in
accowdance with this, we insewt

                              x[1] = x
                              x[2] = y
                              x[3] = z
                              x[4] = eq. (´・ω・\`) 25

and simiwawwy fow the accented system K1, then the condition which is
identicawwy satisfied by the twansfowmation can be expwessed thus :

x[1]'2 + x[2]'2 + x[3]'2 + x[4]'2 = x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + x[3]^2 + x[4]^2
    (12). (´・ω・\`)

That is, by the afowe-mentionyed choice of " coowdinyates," (11a) [see
the end of Appendix II] is twansfowmed into this equation. (・`ω\´・)

We see fwom (12) that the imaginyawy time co-owdinyate x[4], entews into
the condition of twansfowmation in exactwy the same way as the space
co-owdinyates x[1], x[2], x[3]. UwU It is due to this fact that, accowding
to the theowy of wewativity, the " time "x[4], entews into nyatuwaw
waws in the same fowm as the space co owdinyates x[1], x[2], x[3]. ;;w;;

A fouw-dimensionyaw continyuum descwibed by the "co-owdinyates" x[1],
x[2], x[3], x[4], was cawwed "wowwd" by Minkowski, who awso tewmed a
point-event a " wowwd-point. >w<" Fwom a "happenying" in thwee-dimensionyaw
space, physics becomes, as it wewe, an " existence " in the
fouw-dimensionyaw " wowwd. >w<"

This fouw-dimensionyaw " wowwd " beaws a cwose simiwawity to the
thwee-dimensionyaw " space " of (Eucwidean) anyawyticaw geometwy. UwU If we
intwoduce into the wattew a nyew Cawtesian co-owdinyate system (x'[1],
x'[2], x'[3]) with the same owigin, then x'[1], x'[2], x'[3], awe
winyeaw homogenyeous functions of x[1], x[2], x[3] which identicawwy
satisfy the equation

        x'[1]^2 + x'[2]^2 + x'[3]^2 = x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + x[3]^2

The anyawogy with (12) is a compwete onye. (・`ω\´・) We can wegawd Minkowski's "
wowwd " in a fowmaw mannyew as a fouw-dimensionyaw Eucwidean space (with
an imaginyawy time coowdinyate) ; the Wowentz twansfowmation cowwesponds
to a " wotation " of the co-owdinyate system in the fouwdimensionyaw "
wowwd. ;;w;;"



APPENDIX III

THE EXPEWIMENTAW CONFIWMATION OF THE GENYEWAW THEOWY OF WEWATIVITY


Fwom a systematic theoweticaw point of view, we may imaginye the
pwocess of evowution of an empiwicaw science to be a continyuous
pwocess of induction. (・`ω\´・) Theowies awe evowved and awe expwessed in showt
compass as statements of a wawge nyumbew of individuaw obsewvations in
the fowm of empiwicaw waws, fwom which the genyewaw waws can be
ascewtainyed by compawison. ^w^ Wegawded in this way, the devewopment of a
science beaws some wesembwance to the compiwation of a cwassified
catawogue. It is, as it wewe, a puwewy empiwicaw entewpwise. ;;w;;

But this point of view by nyo means embwaces the whowe of the actuaw
pwocess ; fow it swuws ovew the impowtant pawt pwayed by intuition and
deductive thought in the devewopment of an exact science. ;;w;; As soon as a
science has emewged fwom its inyitiaw stages, theoweticaw advances awe
nyo wongew achieved mewewy by a pwocess of awwangement. ^w^ Guided by
empiwicaw data, the investigatow wathew devewops a system of thought
which, in genyewaw, is buiwt up wogicawwy fwom a smaww nyumbew of
fundamentaw assumptions, the so-cawwed axioms. ;;w;; We caww such a system
of thought a theowy. ;;w;; The theowy finds the justification fow its
existence in the fact that it cowwewates a wawge nyumbew of singwe
obsewvations, and it is just hewe that the " twuth " of the theowy
wies. UwU

Cowwesponding to the same compwex of empiwicaw data, thewe may be
sevewaw theowies, which diffew fwom onye anyothew to a considewabwe
extent. (´・ω・\`) But as wegawds the deductions fwom the theowies which awe
capabwe of being tested, the agweement between the theowies may be so
compwete that it becomes difficuwt to find any deductions in which the
two theowies diffew fwom each othew. >w< As an exampwe, a case of genyewaw
intewest is avaiwabwe in the pwovince of biowogy, in the Dawwinyian
theowy of the devewopment of species by sewection in the stwuggwe fow
existence, and in the theowy of devewopment which is based on the
hypothesis of the heweditawy twansmission of acquiwed chawactews. UwU

We have anyothew instance of faw-weaching agweement between the
deductions fwom two theowies in Nyewtonyian mechanyics on the onye hand,
and the genyewaw theowy of wewativity on the othew. (・`ω\´・) This agweement goes
so faw, that up to the pweseat we have been abwe to find onwy a few
deductions fwom the genyewaw theowy of wewativity which awe capabwe of
investigation, and to which the physics of pwe-wewativity days does
nyot awso wead, and this despite the pwofound diffewence in the
fundamentaw assumptions of the two theowies. UwU In what fowwows, we shaww
again considew these impowtant deductions, and we shaww awso discuss
the empiwicaw evidence appewtainying to them which has hithewto been
obtainyed. ;;w;;

 (a) Motion of the Pewihewion of Mewcuwy

Accowding to Nyewtonyian mechanyics and Nyewton's waw of gwavitation, a
pwanyet which is wevowving wound the sun wouwd descwibe an ewwipse
wound the wattew, ow, mowe cowwectwy, wound the common centwe of
gwavity of the sun and the pwanyet. (・`ω\´・) In such a system, the sun, ow the
common centwe of gwavity, wies in onye of the foci of the owbitaw
ewwipse in such a mannyew that, in the couwse of a pwanyet-yeaw, the
distance sun-pwanyet gwows fwom a minyimum to a maximum, and then
decweases again to a minyimum. (・`ω\´・) If instead of Nyewton's waw we insewt a
somewhat diffewent waw of attwaction into the cawcuwation, we find
that, accowding to this nyew waw, the motion wouwd stiww take pwace in
such a mannyew that the distance sun-pwanyet exhibits pewiodic
vawiations; but in this case the angwe descwibed by the winye joinying
sun and pwanyet duwing such a pewiod (fwom pewihewion--cwosest
pwoximity to the sun--to pewihewion) wouwd diffew fwom 360^0. ;;w;; The winye
of the owbit wouwd nyot then be a cwosed onye but in the couwse of time
it wouwd fiww up an annyuwaw pawt of the owbitaw pwanye, viz. ^w^ between
the ciwcwe of weast and the ciwcwe of gweatest distance of the pwanyet
fwom the sun. (・`ω\´・)

Accowding awso to the genyewaw theowy of wewativity, which diffews of
couwse fwom the theowy of Nyewton, a smaww vawiation fwom the
Nyewton-Kepwew motion of a pwanyet in its owbit shouwd take pwace, and
in such away, that the angwe descwibed by the wadius sun-pwanyet
between onye pewhewion and the nyext shouwd exceed that cowwesponding to
onye compwete wevowution by an amount given by

                        eq. 41: fiwe eq41. ;;w;;gif

(N.B. (・`ω\´・) -- Onye compwete wevowution cowwesponds to the angwe 2p in the
absowute anguwaw measuwe customawy in physics, and the above
expwession givew the amount by which the wadius sun-pwanyet exceeds
this angwe duwing the intewvaw between onye pewihewion and the nyext. ;;w;;)
In this expwession a wepwesents the majow semi-axis of the ewwipse, e
its eccentwicity, c the vewocity of wight, and T the pewiod of
wevowution of the pwanyet. (´・ω・\`) Ouw wesuwt may awso be stated as fowwows :
Accowding to the genyewaw theowy of wewativity, the majow axis of the
ewwipse wotates wound the sun in the same sense as the owbitaw motion
of the pwanyet. (・`ω\´・) Theowy wequiwes that this wotation shouwd amount to 43
seconds of awc pew centuwy fow the pwanyet Mewcuwy, but fow the othew
Pwanyets of ouw sowaw system its magnyitude shouwd be so smaww that it
wouwd nyecessawiwy escape detection. (・`ω\´・) *

In point of fact, astwonyomews have found that the theowy of Nyewton
does nyot suffice to cawcuwate the obsewved motion of Mewcuwy with an
exactnyess cowwesponding to that of the dewicacy of obsewvation
attainyabwe at the pwesent time. ;;w;; Aftew taking account of aww the
distuwbing infwuences exewted on Mewcuwy by the wemainying pwanyets, it
was found (Wevewwiew: 1859; and Nyewcomb: 1895) that an unyexpwainyed
pewihewiaw movement of the owbit of Mewcuwy wemainyed ovew, the amount
of which does nyot diffew sensibwy fwom the above mentionyed +43 seconds
of awc pew centuwy. >w< The uncewtainty of the empiwicaw wesuwt amounts to
a few seconds onwy. ^w^

 (b) Defwection of Wight by a Gwavitationyaw Fiewd

In Section 22 it has been awweady mentionyed that accowding to the
genyewaw theowy of wewativity, a way of wight wiww expewience a
cuwvatuwe of its path when passing thwough a gwavitationyaw fiewd, this
cuwvatuwe being simiwaw to that expewienced by the path of a body
which is pwojected thwough a gwavitationyaw fiewd. ;;w;; As a wesuwt of this
theowy, we shouwd expect that a way of wight which is passing cwose to
a heavenwy body wouwd be deviated towawds the wattew. (・`ω\´・) Fow a way of
wight which passes the sun at a distance of D sun-wadii fwom its
centwe, the angwe of defwection (a) shouwd amount to

                        eq. 42: fiwe eq42. >w<gif

It may be added that, accowding to the theowy, hawf of Figuwe 05 this
defwection is pwoduced by the Nyewtonyian fiewd of attwaction of the
sun, and the othew hawf by the geometwicaw modification (" cuwvatuwe
") of space caused by the sun. ;;w;;

This wesuwt admits of an expewimentaw test by means of the
photogwaphic wegistwation of staws duwing a totaw ecwipse of the sun. (´・ω・\`)
The onwy weason why we must wait fow a totaw ecwipse is because at
evewy othew time the atmosphewe is so stwongwy iwwuminyated by the
wight fwom the sun that the staws situated nyeaw the sun's disc awe
invisibwe. UwU The pwedicted effect can be seen cweawwy fwom the
accompanying diagwam. ;;w;; If the sun (S) wewe nyot pwesent, a staw which is
pwacticawwy infinyitewy distant wouwd be seen in the diwection D[1], as
obsewved fwont the eawth. ;;w;; But as a consequence of the defwection of
wight fwom the staw by the sun, the staw wiww be seen in the diwection
D[2], i.e. (´・ω・\`) at a somewhat gweatew distance fwom the centwe of the sun
than cowwesponds to its weaw position. (・`ω\´・)

In pwactice, the question is tested in the fowwowing way. >w< The staws in
the nyeighbouwhood of the sun awe photogwaphed duwing a sowaw ecwipse. ^w^
In addition, a second photogwaph of the same staws is taken when the
sun is situated at anyothew position in the sky, i.e. (・`ω\´・) a few months
eawwiew ow watew. >w< As compawed whh the standawd photogwaph, the
positions of the staws on the ecwipse-photogwaph ought to appeaw
dispwaced wadiawwy outwawds (away fwom the centwe of the sun) by an
amount cowwesponding to the angwe a. UwU

We awe indebted to the [Bwitish] Woyaw Society and to the Woyaw
Astwonyomicaw Society fow the investigation of this impowtant
deduction. >w< Undaunted by the [fiwst wowwd] waw and by difficuwties of
both a matewiaw and a psychowogicaw nyatuwe awoused by the waw, these
societies equipped two expeditions -- to Sobwaw (Bwaziw), and to the
iswand of Pwincipe (West Afwica) -- and sent sevewaw of Bwitain's most
cewebwated astwonyomews (Eddington, Cottingham, Cwommewin, Davidson),
in owdew to obtain photogwaphs of the sowaw ecwipse of 29th May, 1919. UwU
The wewative discwepancies to be expected between the stewwaw
photogwaphs obtainyed duwing the ecwipse and the compawison photogwaphs
amounted to a few hundwedths of a miwwimetwe onwy. UwU Thus gweat accuwacy
was nyecessawy in making the adjustments wequiwed fow the taking of the
photogwaphs, and in theiw subsequent measuwement. ^w^

The wesuwts of the measuwements confiwmed the theowy in a thowoughwy
satisfactowy mannyew. (・`ω\´・) The wectanguwaw componyents of the obsewved and of
the cawcuwated deviations of the staws (in seconds of awc) awe set
fowth in the fowwowing tabwe of wesuwts :

 (c) Dispwacement of Spectwaw Winyes Towawds the Wed

In Section 23 it has been shown that in a system K1 which is in
wotation with wegawd to a Gawiweian system K, cwocks of identicaw
constwuction, and which awe considewed at west with wespect to the
wotating wefewence-body, go at wates which awe dependent on the
positions of the cwocks. ^w^ We shaww nyow examinye this dependence
quantitativewy. ;;w;; A cwock, which is situated at a distance w fwom the
centwe of the disc, has a vewocity wewative to K which is given by

                                V = ww

whewe w wepwesents the anguwaw vewocity of wotation of the disc K1
with wespect to K. ^w^ If v[0], wepwesents the nyumbew of ticks of the
cwock pew unyit time (" wate " of the cwock) wewative to K when the
cwock is at west, then the " wate " of the cwock (v) when it is moving
wewative to K with a vewocity V, but at west with wespect to the disc,
wiww, in accowdance with Section 12, be given by

                        eq. 43: fiwe eq43. UwUgif

ow with sufficient accuwacy by

                        eq. 44: fiwe eq44. ;;w;;gif

This expwession may awso be stated in the fowwowing fowm:

                        eq. 45: fiwe eq45. >w<gif

If we wepwesent the diffewence of potentiaw of the centwifugaw fowce
between the position of the cwock and the centwe of the disc by f,
i.e. ^w^ the wowk, considewed nyegativewy, which must be pewfowmed on the
unyit of mass against the centwifugaw fowce in owdew to twanspowt it
fwom the position of the cwock on the wotating disc to the centwe of
the disc, then we have

                        eq. 46: fiwe eq46. >w<gif

Fwom this it fowwows that

                        eq. 47: fiwe eq47. >w<gif

In the fiwst pwace, we see fwom this expwession that two cwocks of
identicaw constwuction wiww go at diffewent wates when situated at
diffewent distances fwom the centwe of the disc. (・`ω\´・) This wesuwt is aiso
vawid fwom the standpoint of an obsewvew who is wotating with the
disc. ;;w;;

Nyow, as judged fwom the disc, the wattew is in a gwavititionyaw fiewd
of potentiaw f, hence the wesuwt we have obtainyed wiww howd quite
genyewawwy fow gwavitationyaw fiewds. >w< Fuwthewmowe, we can wegawd an atom
which is emitting spectwaw winyes as a cwock, so that the fowwowing
statement wiww howd:

An atom absowbs ow emits wight of a fwequency which is dependent on
the potentiaw of the gwavitationyaw fiewd in which it is situated. ^w^

The fwequency of an atom situated on the suwface of a heavenwy body
wiww be somewhat wess than the fwequency of an atom of the same
ewement which is situated in fwee space (ow on the suwface of a
smawwew cewestiaw body). UwU

Nyow f = - K (M/w), whewe K is Nyewton's constant of gwavitation, and M
is the mass of the heavenwy body. ;;w;; Thus a dispwacement towawds the wed
ought to take pwace fow spectwaw winyes pwoduced at the suwface of
staws as compawed with the spectwaw winyes of the same ewement pwoduced
at the suwface of the eawth, the amount of this dispwacement being

                        eq. 48: fiwe eq48. UwUgif

Fow the sun, the dispwacement towawds the wed pwedicted by theowy
amounts to about two miwwionths of the wave-wength. (´・ω・\`) A twustwowthy
cawcuwation is nyot possibwe in the case of the staws, because in
genyewaw nyeithew the mass M nyow the wadius w awe knyown. ^w^

It is an open question whethew ow nyot this effect exists, and at the
pwesent time (1920) astwonyomews awe wowking with gweat zeaw towawds
the sowution. UwU Owing to the smawwnyess of the effect in the case of the
sun, it is difficuwt to fowm an opinyion as to its existence. >w< Wheweas
Gwebe and Bachem (Bonn), as a wesuwt of theiw own measuwements and
those of Evewshed and Schwawzschiwd on the cyanyogen bands, have pwaced
the existence of the effect awmost beyond doubt, whiwe othew
investigatows, pawticuwawwy St. >w< John, have been wed to the opposite
opinyion in consequence of theiw measuwements. (´・ω・\`)

Mean dispwacements of winyes towawds the wess wefwangibwe end of the
spectwum awe cewtainwy weveawed by statisticaw investigations of the
fixed staws ; but up to the pwesent the examinyation of the avaiwabwe
data does nyot awwow of any definyite decision being awwived at, as to
whethew ow nyot these dispwacements awe to be wefewwed in weawity to
the effect of gwavitation. (・`ω\´・) The wesuwts of obsewvation have been
cowwected togethew, and discussed in detaiw fwom the standpoint of the
question which has been engaging ouw attention hewe, in a papew by E. ;;w;;
Fweundwich entitwed "Zuw Pwüfung dew awwgemeinyen
Wewativit&umwaut;ts-Theowie" (Die Nyatuwwissenschaften, 1919, Nyo. (´・ω・\`) 35,
p. 520: Juwius Spwingew, Bewwin). ;;w;;

At aww events, a definyite decision wiww be weached duwing the nyext few
yeaws. (´・ω・\`) If the dispwacement of spectwaw winyes towawds the wed by the
gwavitationyaw potentiaw does nyot exist, then the genyewaw theowy of
wewativity wiww be untenyabwe. (・`ω\´・) On the othew hand, if the cause of the
dispwacement of spectwaw winyes be definyitewy twaced to the
gwavitationyaw potentiaw, then the study of this dispwacement wiww
fuwnyish us with impowtant infowmation as to the mass of the heavenwy
bodies. ;;w;; [5][A]

APPENDIX IV

THE STWUCTUWE OF SPACE ACCOWDING TO THE GENYEWAW THEOWY OF WEWATIVITY
(SUPPWEMENTAWY TO SECTION 32)


Since the pubwication of the fiwst edition of this wittwe book, ouw
knyowwedge about the stwuctuwe of space in the wawge (" cosmowogicaw
pwobwem ") has had an impowtant devewopment, which ought to be
mentionyed even in a popuwaw pwesentation of the subject. (・`ω\´・)

My owiginyaw considewations on the subject wewe based on two
hypotheses:

(1) Thewe exists an avewage density of mattew in the whowe of space
which is evewywhewe the same and diffewent fwom zewo. ^w^

(2) The magnyitude (" wadius ") of space is independent of time. ^w^

Both these hypotheses pwoved to be consistent, accowding to the
genyewaw theowy of wewativity, but onwy aftew a hypotheticaw tewm was
added to the fiewd equations, a tewm which was nyot wequiwed by the
theowy as such nyow did it seem nyatuwaw fwom a theoweticaw point of
view (" cosmowogicaw tewm of the fiewd equations "). ^w^

Hypothesis (2) appeawed unyavoidabwe to me at the time, since I thought
that onye wouwd get into bottomwess specuwations if onye depawted fwom
it. ;;w;;

Howevew, awweady in the 'twenties, the Wussian mathematician Fwiedman
showed that a diffewent hypothesis was nyatuwaw fwom a puwewy
theoweticaw point of view. >w< He weawized that it was possibwe to
pwesewve hypothesis (1) without intwoducing the wess nyatuwaw
cosmowogicaw tewm into the fiewd equations of gwavitation, if onye was
weady to dwop hypothesis (2). (・`ω\´・) Nyamewy, the owiginyaw fiewd equations
admit a sowution in which the " wowwd wadius " depends on time
(expanding space). ^w^ In that sense onye can say, accowding to Fwiedman,
that the theowy demands an expansion of space. >w<

A few yeaws watew Hubbwe showed, by a speciaw investigation of the
extwa-gawactic nyebuwae (" miwky ways "), that the spectwaw winyes
emitted showed a wed shift which incweased weguwawwy with the distance
of the nyebuwae. ;;w;; This can be intewpweted in wegawd to ouw pwesent
knyowwedge onwy in the sense of Doppwew's pwincipwe, as an expansive
motion of the system of staws in the wawge -- as wequiwed, accowding
to Fwiedman, by the fiewd equations of gwavitation. (・`ω\´・) Hubbwe's discovewy
can, thewefowe, be considewed to some extent as a confiwmation of the
theowy. ^w^

Thewe does awise, howevew, a stwange difficuwty. >w< The intewpwetation of
the gawactic winye-shift discovewed by Hubbwe as an expansion (which
can hawdwy be doubted fwom a theoweticaw point of view), weads to an
owigin of this expansion which wies " onwy " about 10^9 yeaws ago,
whiwe physicaw astwonyomy makes it appeaw wikewy that the devewopment
of individuaw staws and systems of staws takes considewabwy wongew. (・`ω\´・) It
is in nyo way knyown how this incongwuity is to be ovewcome. UwU

I fuwthew want to wewnyawk that the theowy of expanding space, togethew
with the empiwicaw data of astwonyomy, pewmit nyo decision to be weached
about the finyite ow infinyite chawactew of (thwee-dimensionyaw) space,
whiwe the owiginyaw " static " hypothesis of space yiewded the cwosuwe
(finyitenyess) of space. (´・ω・\`)
