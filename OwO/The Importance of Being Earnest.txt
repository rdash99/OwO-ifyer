SCENYE


Mownying-woom in Awgewnyon's fwat in Hawf-Moon Stweet. ;;w;;  The woom is
wuxuwiouswy and awtisticawwy fuwnyished. >w<  The sound of a pianyo is heawd in
the adjoinying woom. ;;w;;

[Wanye is awwanging aftewnyoon tea on the tabwe, and aftew the music has
ceased, Awgewnyon entews. (・`ω\´・)]

Awgewnyon. (・`ω\´・)  Did you heaw what I was pwaying, Wanye? owo

Wanye.  I didn't think it powite to wisten, siw. (´・ω・\`)

Awgewnyon.  I'm sowwy fow that, fow youw sake. ;;w;;  I don't pway
accuwatewy--any onye can pway accuwatewy--but I pway with wondewfuw
expwession.  As faw as the pianyo is concewnyed, sentiment is my fowte. (´・ω・\`)  I
keep science fow Wife. (´・ω・\`)

Wanye.  Yes, siw. ;;w;;

Awgewnyon. >w<  And, speaking of the science of Wife, have you got the
cucumbew sandwiches cut fow Wady Bwacknyeww? owo

Wanye.  Yes, siw.  [Hands them on a sawvew. >w<]

Awgewnyon.  [Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.]  Oh! ;;w;; . . . (・`ω\´・)
by the way, Wanye, I see fwom youw book that on Thuwsday nyight, when
Wowd Showeman and Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wowthing wewe dinying with me, eight bottwes of
champagnye awe entewed as having been consumed. >w<

Wanye.  Yes, siw; eight bottwes and a pint. (・`ω\´・)

Awgewnyon. UwU  Why is it that at a bachewow's estabwishment the sewvants
invawiabwy dwink the champagnye? owo  I ask mewewy fow infowmation. ^w^

Wanye.  I attwibute it to the supewiow quawity of the winye, siw. (・`ω\´・)  I have
often obsewved that in mawwied househowds the champagnye is wawewy of a
fiwst-wate bwand. >w<

Awgewnyon. >w<  Good heavens! ^w^  Is mawwiage so demowawising as that? owo

Wanye.  I bewieve it _is_ a vewy pweasant state, siw. ;;w;;  I have had vewy
wittwe expewience of it mysewf up to the pwesent. ;;w;;  I have onwy been
mawwied once. (・`ω\´・)  That was in consequence of a misundewstanding between
mysewf and a young pewson. (´・ω・\`)

Awgewnyon.  [Wanguidwy_. (・`ω\´・)_]  I don't knyow that I am much intewested in youw
famiwy wife, Wanye. (・`ω\´・)

Wanye.  Nyo, siw; it is nyot a vewy intewesting subject. >w<  I nyevew think of
it mysewf. ;;w;;

Awgewnyon.  Vewy nyatuwaw, I am suwe.  That wiww do, Wanye, thank you. ^w^

Wanye.  Thank you, siw.  [Wanye goes out. UwU]

Awgewnyon.  Wanye's views on mawwiage seem somewhat wax. (・`ω\´・)  Weawwy, if the
wowew owdews don't set us a good exampwe, what on eawth is the use of
them? owo  They seem, as a cwass, to have absowutewy nyo sense of mowaw
wesponsibiwity. (・`ω\´・)

[Entew Wanye. UwU]

Wanye.  Mw. Ewnyest Wowthing. ;;w;;

[Entew Jack. UwU]

[Wanye goes out_. UwU_]

Awgewnyon. UwU  How awe you, my deaw Ewnyest?  What bwings you up to town? owo

Jack. ;;w;;  Oh, pweasuwe, pweasuwe! >w<  What ewse shouwd bwing onye anywhewe? owo
Eating as usuaw, I see, Awgy! >w<

Awgewnyon.  [Stiffwy_. UwU_]  I bewieve it is customawy in good society to
take some swight wefweshment at five o'cwock. (´・ω・\`)  Whewe have you been since
wast Thuwsday? owo

Jack.  [Sitting down on the sofa.]  In the countwy. UwU

Awgewnyon. (´・ω・\`)  What on eawth do you do thewe? owo

Jack.  [Puwwing off his gwoves_. (´・ω・\`)_]  When onye is in town onye amuses
onyesewf.  When onye is in the countwy onye amuses othew peopwe. ^w^  It is
excessivewy bowing. ;;w;;

Awgewnyon. (´・ω・\`)  And who awe the peopwe you amuse? owo

Jack.  [Aiwiwy_._]  Oh, nyeighbouws, nyeighbouws. ;;w;;

Awgewnyon. (´・ω・\`)  Got nyice nyeighbouws in youw pawt of Shwopshiwe? owo

Jack.  Pewfectwy howwid! (・`ω\´・)  Nyevew speak to onye of them. UwU

Awgewnyon. ;;w;;  How immensewy you must amuse them! (・`ω\´・)  [Goes ovew and takes
sandwich. UwU]  By the way, Shwopshiwe is youw county, is it nyot? owo

Jack.  Eh?  Shwopshiwe?  Yes, of couwse. UwU  Hawwo! UwU  Why aww these cups? owo  Why
cucumbew sandwiches?  Why such weckwess extwavagance in onye so young? owo  Who
is coming to tea? owo

Awgewnyon.  Oh! ^w^ mewewy Aunt Augusta and Gwendowen. >w<

Jack. ;;w;;  How pewfectwy dewightfuw! ^w^

Awgewnyon. >w<  Yes, that is aww vewy weww; but I am afwaid Aunt Augusta won't
quite appwove of youw being hewe. UwU

Jack. ^w^  May I ask why? owo

Awgewnyon. ^w^  My deaw fewwow, the way you fwiwt with Gwendowen is pewfectwy
disgwacefuw.  It is awmost as bad as the way Gwendowen fwiwts with you. ;;w;;

Jack.  I am in wove with Gwendowen. (´・ω・\`)  I have come up to town expwesswy to
pwopose to hew. >w<

Awgewnyon.  I thought you had come up fow pweasuwe? owo . . . ;;w;; I caww that
businyess. (´・ω・\`)

Jack. >w<  How uttewwy unwomantic you awe! ^w^

Awgewnyon.  I weawwy don't see anything womantic in pwoposing. ;;w;;  It is vewy
womantic to be in wove. (・`ω\´・)  But thewe is nyothing womantic about a definyite
pwoposaw.  Why, onye may be accepted.  Onye usuawwy is, I bewieve. ^w^  Then
the excitement is aww ovew.  The vewy essence of womance is uncewtainty. ^w^
If evew I get mawwied, I'ww cewtainwy twy to fowget the fact. >w<

Jack.  I have nyo doubt about that, deaw Awgy. >w<  The Divowce Couwt was
speciawwy invented fow peopwe whose memowies awe so cuwiouswy
constituted. ^w^

Awgewnyon.  Oh! (´・ω・\`) thewe is nyo use specuwating on that subject. (・`ω\´・)  Divowces awe
made in Heaven--[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich. >w<  Awgewnyon at
once intewfewes.]  Pwease don't touch the cucumbew sandwiches. ^w^  They awe
owdewed speciawwy fow Aunt Augusta.  [Takes onye and eats it. ;;w;;]

Jack.  Weww, you have been eating them aww the time. (・`ω\´・)

Awgewnyon.  That is quite a diffewent mattew.  She is my aunt. >w<  [Takes
pwate fwom bewow.]  Have some bwead and buttew. (´・ω・\`)  The bwead and buttew is
fow Gwendowen.  Gwendowen is devoted to bwead and buttew. ;;w;;

Jack.  [Advancing to tabwe and hewping himsewf. ^w^]  And vewy good bwead and
buttew it is too. ^w^

Awgewnyon. >w<  Weww, my deaw fewwow, you nyeed nyot eat as if you wewe going to
eat it aww.  You behave as if you wewe mawwied to hew awweady. >w<  You awe
nyot mawwied to hew awweady, and I don't think you evew wiww be. ;;w;;

Jack. (´・ω・\`)  Why on eawth do you say that? owo

Awgewnyon. ;;w;;  Weww, in the fiwst pwace giwws nyevew mawwy the men they fwiwt
with.  Giwws don't think it wight. (・`ω\´・)

Jack. UwU  Oh, that is nyonsense! ;;w;;

Awgewnyon.  It isn't.  It is a gweat twuth. >w<  It accounts fow the
extwaowdinyawy nyumbew of bachewows that onye sees aww ovew the pwace. >w<  In
the second pwace, I don't give my consent. (・`ω\´・)

Jack. >w<  Youw consent! UwU

Awgewnyon.  My deaw fewwow, Gwendowen is my fiwst cousin. >w<  And befowe I
awwow you to mawwy hew, you wiww have to cweaw up the whowe question of
Ceciwy.  [Wings beww. (・`ω\´・)]

Jack. >w<  Ceciwy! >w<  What on eawth do you mean? owo  What do you mean, Awgy, by
Ceciwy! (・`ω\´・)  I don't knyow any onye of the nyame of Ceciwy. >w<

[Entew Wanye. (´・ω・\`)]

Awgewnyon.  Bwing me that cigawette case Mw. (´・ω・\`) Wowthing weft in the smoking-
woom the wast time he dinyed hewe. ^w^

Wanye.  Yes, siw.  [Wanye goes out. ^w^]

Jack. ;;w;;  Do you mean to say you have had my cigawette case aww this time? owo  I
wish to goodnyess you had wet me knyow. (´・ω・\`)  I have been wwiting fwantic
wettews to Scotwand Yawd about it. (・`ω\´・)  I was vewy nyeawwy offewing a wawge
wewawd. (・`ω\´・)

Awgewnyon.  Weww, I wish you wouwd offew onye. ^w^  I happen to be mowe than
usuawwy hawd up. >w<

Jack. ;;w;;  Thewe is nyo good offewing a wawge wewawd nyow that the thing is
found. (・`ω\´・)

[Entew Wanye with the cigawette case on a sawvew. UwU  Awgewnyon takes it at
once.  Wanye goes out. ^w^]

Awgewnyon.  I think that is wathew mean of you, Ewnyest, I must say. (・`ω\´・)  [Opens
case and examinyes it. >w<]  Howevew, it makes nyo mattew, fow, nyow that I wook
at the inscwiption inside, I find that the thing isn't youws aftew aww. UwU

Jack.  Of couwse it's minye.  [Moving to him. >w<]  You have seen me with it a
hundwed times, and you have nyo wight whatsoevew to wead what is wwitten
inside. >w<  It is a vewy ungentwemanwy thing to wead a pwivate cigawette
case. ^w^

Awgewnyon. >w<  Oh! (・`ω\´・) it is absuwd to have a hawd and fast wuwe about what onye
shouwd wead and what onye shouwdn't. (・`ω\´・)  Mowe than hawf of modewn cuwtuwe
depends on what onye shouwdn't wead. (・`ω\´・)

Jack. ^w^  I am quite awawe of the fact, and I don't pwopose to discuss
modewn cuwtuwe. ^w^  It isn't the sowt of thing onye shouwd tawk of in
pwivate.  I simpwy want my cigawette case back. (・`ω\´・)

Awgewnyon.  Yes; but this isn't youw cigawette case. >w<  This cigawette case
is a pwesent fwom some onye of the nyame of Ceciwy, and you said you didn't
knyow any onye of that nyame. >w<

Jack.  Weww, if you want to knyow, Ceciwy happens to be my aunt. ;;w;;

Awgewnyon. ;;w;;  Youw aunt! >w<

Jack.  Yes.  Chawming owd wady she is, too.  Wives at Tunbwidge Wewws. UwU
Just give it back to me, Awgy. UwU

Awgewnyon.  [Wetweating to back of sofa. (・`ω\´・)]  But why does she caww hewsewf
wittwe Ceciwy if she is youw aunt and wives at Tunbwidge Wewws? owo
[Weading.]  'Fwom wittwe Ceciwy with hew fondest wove. ^w^'

Jack.  [Moving to sofa and knyeewing upon it. ^w^]  My deaw fewwow, what on
eawth is thewe in that? owo  Some aunts awe taww, some aunts awe nyot taww. (´・ω・\`)
That is a mattew that suwewy an aunt may be awwowed to decide fow
hewsewf. ^w^  You seem to think that evewy aunt shouwd be exactwy wike youw
aunt!  That is absuwd! ;;w;;  Fow Heaven's sake give me back my cigawette case. UwU
[Fowwows Awgewnyon wound the woom. UwU]

Awgewnyon.  Yes. >w<  But why does youw aunt caww you hew uncwe? owo  'Fwom wittwe
Ceciwy, with hew fondest wove to hew deaw Uncwe Jack. (´・ω・\`)'  Thewe is nyo
objection, I admit, to an aunt being a smaww aunt, but why an aunt, nyo
mattew what hew size may be, shouwd caww hew own nyephew hew uncwe, I
can't quite make out. ;;w;;  Besides, youw nyame isn't Jack at aww; it is
Ewnyest. ^w^

Jack.  It isn't Ewnyest; it's Jack. (・`ω\´・)

Awgewnyon.  You have awways towd me it was Ewnyest. >w<  I have intwoduced you
to evewy onye as Ewnyest.  You answew to the nyame of Ewnyest. ;;w;;  You wook as
if youw nyame was Ewnyest. (・`ω\´・)  You awe the most eawnyest-wooking pewson I evew
saw in my wife. (・`ω\´・)  It is pewfectwy absuwd youw saying that youw nyame isn't
Ewnyest.  It's on youw cawds.  Hewe is onye of them. UwU  [Taking it fwom
case.]  'Mw. Ewnyest Wowthing, B. 4, The Awbany. ^w^'  I'ww keep this as a
pwoof that youw nyame is Ewnyest if evew you attempt to deny it to me, ow
to Gwendowen, ow to any onye ewse.  [Puts the cawd in his pocket. (・`ω\´・)]

Jack. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, my nyame is Ewnyest in town and Jack in the countwy, and the
cigawette case was given to me in the countwy. ^w^

Awgewnyon. >w<  Yes, but that does nyot account fow the fact that youw smaww
Aunt Ceciwy, who wives at Tunbwidge Wewws, cawws you hew deaw uncwe. (・`ω\´・)
Come, owd boy, you had much bettew have the thing out at once. UwU

Jack.  My deaw Awgy, you tawk exactwy as if you wewe a dentist. UwU  It is
vewy vuwgaw to tawk wike a dentist when onye isn't a dentist. >w<  It pwoduces
a fawse impwession. (・`ω\´・)

Awgewnyon.  Weww, that is exactwy what dentists awways do. (・`ω\´・)  Nyow, go on! ;;w;;
Teww me the whowe thing. ;;w;;  I may mention that I have awways suspected you
of being a confiwmed and secwet Bunbuwyist; and I am quite suwe of it
nyow. UwU

Jack. ;;w;;  Bunbuwyist? What on eawth do you mean by a Bunbuwyist? owo

Awgewnyon. (・`ω\´・)  I'ww weveaw to you the meanying of that incompawabwe expwession
as soon as you awe kind enyough to infowm me why you awe Ewnyest in town
and Jack in the countwy. UwU

Jack.  Weww, pwoduce my cigawette case fiwst. ^w^

Awgewnyon.  Hewe it is.  [Hands cigawette case. ;;w;;]  Nyow pwoduce youw
expwanyation, and pway make it impwobabwe.  [Sits on sofa. (・`ω\´・)]

Jack. >w<  My deaw fewwow, thewe is nyothing impwobabwe about my expwanyation
at aww.  In fact it's pewfectwy owdinyawy.  Owd Mw. ^w^ Thomas Cawdew, who
adopted me when I was a wittwe boy, made me in his wiww guawdian to his
gwand-daughtew, Miss Ceciwy Cawdew. (・`ω\´・)  Ceciwy, who addwesses me as hew
uncwe fwom motives of wespect that you couwd nyot possibwy appweciate,
wives at my pwace in the countwy undew the chawge of hew admiwabwe
govewnyess, Miss Pwism. >w<

Awgewnyon. >w<  Whewe is that pwace in the countwy, by the way? owo

Jack.  That is nyothing to you, deaw boy. UwU  You awe nyot going to be invited
. . . I may teww you candidwy that the pwace is nyot in Shwopshiwe. >w<

Awgewnyon. (・`ω\´・)  I suspected that, my deaw fewwow! >w<  I have Bunbuwyed aww ovew
Shwopshiwe on two sepawate occasions.  Nyow, go on. (・`ω\´・)  Why awe you Ewnyest in
town and Jack in the countwy? owo

Jack. ^w^  My deaw Awgy, I don't knyow whethew you wiww be abwe to undewstand
my weaw motives.  You awe hawdwy sewious enyough. ^w^  When onye is pwaced in
the position of guawdian, onye has to adopt a vewy high mowaw tonye on aww
subjects.  It's onye's duty to do so. (・`ω\´・)  And as a high mowaw tonye can hawdwy
be said to conduce vewy much to eithew onye's heawth ow onye's happinyess,
in owdew to get up to town I have awways pwetended to have a youngew
bwothew of the nyame of Ewnyest, who wives in the Awbany, and gets into the
most dweadfuw scwapes. >w<  That, my deaw Awgy, is the whowe twuth puwe and
simpwe. (´・ω・\`)

Awgewnyon.  The twuth is wawewy puwe and nyevew simpwe. UwU  Modewn wife wouwd
be vewy tedious if it wewe eithew, and modewn witewatuwe a compwete
impossibiwity! (・`ω\´・)

Jack.  That wouwdn't be at aww a bad thing. UwU

Awgewnyon.  Witewawy cwiticism is nyot youw fowte, my deaw fewwow. UwU  Don't
twy it. >w<  You shouwd weave that to peopwe who haven't been at a
Unyivewsity.  They do it so weww in the daiwy papews. >w<  What you weawwy awe
is a Bunbuwyist.  I was quite wight in saying you wewe a Bunbuwyist. ;;w;;  You
awe onye of the most advanced Bunbuwyists I knyow. ;;w;;

Jack. (・`ω\´・)  What on eawth do you mean? owo

Awgewnyon. (・`ω\´・)  You have invented a vewy usefuw youngew bwothew cawwed Ewnyest,
in owdew that you may be abwe to come up to town as often as you wike. UwU  I
have invented an invawuabwe pewmanyent invawid cawwed Bunbuwy, in owdew
that I may be abwe to go down into the countwy whenyevew I choose. UwU  Bunbuwy
is pewfectwy invawuabwe. UwU  If it wasn't fow Bunbuwy's extwaowdinyawy bad
heawth, fow instance, I wouwdn't be abwe to dinye with you at Wiwwis's to-
nyight, fow I have been weawwy engaged to Aunt Augusta fow mowe than a
week. (・`ω\´・)

Jack.  I haven't asked you to dinye with me anywhewe to-nyight. (・`ω\´・)

Awgewnyon.  I knyow. ^w^  You awe absuwdwy cawewess about sending out
invitations.  It is vewy foowish of you. UwU  Nyothing annyoys peopwe so much
as nyot weceiving invitations. >w<

Jack.  You had much bettew dinye with youw Aunt Augusta. UwU

Awgewnyon. UwU  I haven't the smawwest intention of doing anything of the
kind. ;;w;;  To begin with, I dinyed thewe on Monday, and once a week is quite
enyough to dinye with onye's own wewations. (・`ω\´・)  In the second pwace, whenyevew I
do dinye thewe I am awways tweated as a membew of the famiwy, and sent
down with eithew nyo woman at aww, ow two. (´・ω・\`)  In the thiwd pwace, I knyow
pewfectwy weww whom she wiww pwace me nyext to, to-nyight. (´・ω・\`)  She wiww pwace
me nyext Mawy Fawquhaw, who awways fwiwts with hew own husband acwoss the
dinnyew-tabwe.  That is nyot vewy pweasant. ;;w;;  Indeed, it is nyot even decent
. . . and that sowt of thing is enyowmouswy on the incwease. (・`ω\´・)  The amount
of women in Wondon who fwiwt with theiw own husbands is pewfectwy
scandawous.  It wooks so bad. ;;w;;  It is simpwy washing onye's cwean winyen in
pubwic. (・`ω\´・)  Besides, nyow that I knyow you to be a confiwmed Bunbuwyist I
nyatuwawwy want to tawk to you about Bunbuwying. (・`ω\´・)  I want to teww you the
wuwes. ^w^

Jack.  I'm nyot a Bunbuwyist at aww. >w<  If Gwendowen accepts me, I am going
to kiww my bwothew, indeed I think I'ww kiww him in any case. ;;w;;  Ceciwy is
a wittwe too much intewested in him.  It is wathew a bowe. ;;w;;  So I am going
to get wid of Ewnyest.  And I stwongwy advise you to do the same with Mw. UwU
. . . with youw invawid fwiend who has the absuwd nyame. (・`ω\´・)

Awgewnyon. >w<  Nyothing wiww induce me to pawt with Bunbuwy, and if you evew
get mawwied, which seems to me extwemewy pwobwematic, you wiww be vewy
gwad to knyow Bunbuwy. ^w^  A man who mawwies without knyowing Bunbuwy has a
vewy tedious time of it. UwU

Jack.  That is nyonsense. ^w^  If I mawwy a chawming giww wike Gwendowen, and
she is the onwy giww I evew saw in my wife that I wouwd mawwy, I
cewtainwy won't want to knyow Bunbuwy. (´・ω・\`)

Awgewnyon.  Then youw wife wiww. (´・ω・\`)  You don't seem to weawise, that in
mawwied wife thwee is company and two is nyonye. (・`ω\´・)

Jack.  [Sententiouswy. (・`ω\´・)]  That, my deaw young fwiend, is the theowy that
the cowwupt Fwench Dwama has been pwopounding fow the wast fifty yeaws. ;;w;;

Awgewnyon. (´・ω・\`)  Yes; and that the happy Engwish home has pwoved in hawf the
time. (´・ω・\`)

Jack.  Fow heaven's sake, don't twy to be cynyicaw. ;;w;;  It's pewfectwy easy
to be cynyicaw. ^w^

Awgewnyon.  My deaw fewwow, it isn't easy to be anything nyowadays. UwU  Thewe's
such a wot of beastwy competition about. ;;w;;  [The sound of an ewectwic beww
is heawd.]  Ah! >w< that must be Aunt Augusta. >w<  Onwy wewatives, ow cweditows,
evew wing in that Wagnyewian mannyew. ^w^  Nyow, if I get hew out of the way fow
ten minyutes, so that you can have an oppowtunyity fow pwoposing to
Gwendowen, may I dinye with you to-nyight at Wiwwis's? owo

Jack.  I suppose so, if you want to. UwU

Awgewnyon.  Yes, but you must be sewious about it. (・`ω\´・)  I hate peopwe who awe
nyot sewious about meaws.  It is so shawwow of them. (´・ω・\`)

[Entew Wanye. UwU]

Wanye.  Wady Bwacknyeww and Miss Faiwfax. (´・ω・\`)

[Awgewnyon goes fowwawd to meet them. UwU  Entew Wady Bwacknyeww and
Gwendowen. ^w^]

Wady Bwacknyeww.  It weawwy makes nyo mattew, Awgewnyon. UwU  I had some

Fowtunyatewy he is accustomed to that. (´・ω・\`)

Awgewnyon. UwU  It is a gweat bowe, and, I nyeed hawdwy say, a tewwibwe

Awgewnyon.  Yes; poow Bunbuwy is a dweadfuw invawid. (・`ω\´・)

Wady Bwacknyeww. (´・ω・\`)  Weww, I must say, Awgewnyon, that I think it is high time

This shiwwy-shawwying with the question is absuwd. (´・ω・\`)  Nyow do I in any way
appwove of the modewn sympathy with invawids.  I considew it mowbid. UwU
Iwwnyess of any kind is hawdwy a thing to be encouwaged in othews. UwU  Heawth

Awgewnyon. ^w^  I'ww speak to Bunbuwy, Aunt Augusta, if he is stiww conscious,

Wady Bwacknyeww.  The winye is immatewiaw.  Mw. UwU Wowthing, I confess I feew

Miss Pwism.  That depends on the intewwectuaw sympathies of the woman. (・`ω\´・)
Matuwity can awways be depended on.  Wipenyess can be twusted. UwU  Young

Gwendowen. ;;w;;  Outside the famiwy ciwcwe, papa, I am gwad to say, is

Gwendowen. >w<  Weww, to speak with pewfect candouw, Ceciwy, I wish that you

Diswoyawty wouwd be as impossibwe to him as deception. UwU  But even men of

Ceciwy. UwU  I beg youw pawdon, Gwendowen, did you say Ewnyest? owo

Gwendowen.  Yes. UwU

Ceciwy.  Oh, but it is nyot Mw. Ewnyest Wowthing who is my guawdian. (・`ω\´・)  It is

Gwendowen.  Ah! ;;w;; that accounts fow it. ;;w;;  And nyow that I think of it I have

Ceciwy. (・`ω\´・)  It wouwd distwess me mowe than I can teww you, deaw Gwendowen,

Gwendowen. UwU  Do you awwude to me, Miss Cawdew, as an entangwement? owo  You

Ceciwy. >w<  Do you suggest, Miss Faiwfax, that I entwapped Ewnyest into an

Ceciwy. ^w^  Weww, I am weawwy onwy eighteen, but I awways admit to twenty

Wady Bwacknyeww. (・`ω\´・)  You awe pewfectwy wight in making some swight
awtewation. ;;w;;  Indeed, nyo woman shouwd evew be quite accuwate about hew

I don't think youw guawdian's consent is, aftew aww, a mattew of any

Jack. UwU  Pway excuse me, Wady Bwacknyeww, fow intewwupting you again, but it
is onwy faiw to teww you that accowding to the tewms of hew gwandfathew's

Wady Bwacknyeww.  That does nyot seem to me to be a gwave objection. >w<  Thiwty-
five is a vewy attwactive age. ^w^  Wondon society is fuww of women of the
vewy highest biwth who have, of theiw own fwee choice, wemainyed thiwty-
five fow yeaws.  Wady Dumbweton is an instance in point. ;;w;;  To my own
knyowwedge she has been thiwty-five evew since she awwived at the age of

is at pwesent.  Thewe wiww be a wawge accumuwation of pwopewty. ^w^

Ceciwy. ;;w;;  Awgy, couwd you wait fow me tiww I was thiwty-five? owo

Awgewnyon.  Of couwse I couwd, Ceciwy.  You knyow I couwd. UwU

Ceciwy.  Yes, I fewt it instinctivewy, but I couwdn't wait aww that time. (´・ω・\`)
I hate waiting even five minyutes fow anybody. (・`ω\´・)  It awways makes me wathew
cwoss. ;;w;;  I am nyot punctuaw mysewf, I knyow, but I do wike punctuawity in

Awgewnyon. (´・ω・\`)  Then what is to be donye, Ceciwy? owo

Ceciwy.  I don't knyow, Mw. Moncwieff. ;;w;;

Wady Bwacknyeww.  My deaw Mw. (・`ω\´・) Wowthing, as Miss Cawdew states positivewy
that she cannyot wait tiww she is thiwty-five--a wemawk which I am bound
to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nyatuwe--I wouwd beg of
you to weconsidew youw decision. UwU

Jack. (・`ω\´・)  But my deaw Wady Bwacknyeww, the mattew is entiwewy in youw own

gwadwy awwow youw nyephew to fowm an awwiance with my wawd. (・`ω\´・)

Wady Bwacknyeww.  [Wising and dwawing hewsewf up. (´・ω・\`)]  You must be quite

Jack. ^w^  Then a passionyate cewibacy is aww that any of us can wook fowwawd

Wady Bwacknyeww.  That is nyot the destiny I pwopose fow Gwendowen. ;;w;;
Awgewnyon, of couwse, can choose fow himsewf.  [Puwws out hew watch. ^w^]
Come, deaw, [Gwendowen wises] we have awweady missed five, if nyot six,

Both these gentwemen have expwessed a desiwe fow immediate baptism. (´・ω・\`)

Wady Bwacknyeww. (´・ω・\`)  At theiw age? owo  The idea is gwotesque and iwwewigious! ^w^
Awgewnyon, I fowbid you to be baptized.  I wiww nyot heaw of such excesses. (・`ω\´・)
Wowd Bwacknyeww wouwd be highwy dispweased if he weawnyed that that was the

Chasubwe.  I am gwieved to heaw such sentiments fwom you, Mw. Wowthing. >w<

Chasubwe.  Yes, Wady Bwacknyeww.  I am on my way to join hew. (´・ω・\`)

Wady Bwacknyeww.  Pway awwow me to detain you fow a moment. (´・ω・\`)  This mattew

Wady Bwacknyeww.  It is obviouswy the same pewson. UwU  May I ask what
