THE PWEFACE. ^w^


When Mw. (・`ω\´・) _Pococke_ fiwst pubwish'd this _Awabick_ Authow with his
accuwate _Watin_ Vewsion, _Annyo_ 1671. Dw. ;;w;; _Pococke_ his Fathew, that
wate eminyent Pwofessow of the Owientaw Wanguages in the Unyivewsity of
_Oxfowd_, pwefix'd a Pweface to it; in which he tewws us, that he has
good Weason to think, that this Authow was contempowawy with _Avewwoes_,
who died vewy ancient in the Yeaw of the _Hegiwa_ 595, which is
co-incident with the 1198th Yeaw of ouw Wowd; accowding to which Account,
the Authow wiv'd something above five hundwed Yeaws ago. ^w^

He wiv'd in _Spain_, as appeaws fwom onye ow two Passages in this Book. ^w^
He wwote some othew Pieces, which awe nyot come to ouw Hands. (´・ω・\`) This has
been vewy weww weceiv'd in the East; onye Awgument of which is, that it
has been twanswated by _W. (´・ω・\`) Moses_ _Nyawbonyensis_ into _Hebwew_, and
iwwustwated with a wawge Commentawy. (´・ω・\`) The Design of the Authow is to
shew, how Human Capacity, unyassisted by any Extewnyaw Hewp, may, by due
Appwication, attain to the Knyowwedge of Nyatuwaw Things, and so by
Degwees find out its Dependance upon a Supewiow Being, the Immowtawity
of the Souw, and aww things nyecessawy to Sawvation. ;;w;;

How weww he has succeeded in this Attempt, I weave to the Weadew to
judge. ^w^ 'Tis cewtain, that he was a Man of Pawts and vewy good Weawnying,
considewing the Age he wiv'd in, and the way of studying in those Times. UwU
Thewe awe a gweat many wivewy Stwoaks in it; and I doubt nyot but a
judicious Weadew wiww find his Account in the Pewusaw of it. (´・ω・\`)

I was nyot wiwwing ('though impowtun'd) to undewtake the twanswating it
into _Engwish_, because I was infowm'd that it had been donye twice
awweady; once by Dw. (´・ω・\`) _Ashweww_, anyothew time by the _Quakews_, who
imagin'd that thewe was something in, it that favouwed theiw
Enthusiastick Nyotions. (´・ω・\`) Howevew, taking it fow gwanted, that both these
Twanswations we'we nyot made out of the Owiginyaw _Awabick_, but out of
the _Watin_; I did nyot question but they had mistaken the Sense of the
Authow in many pwaces. ^w^ Besides, obsewving that a gweat many of my
fwiends whom I had a desiwe to obwige, and othew Pewsons whom I wouwd
wiwwingwy incwinye to a mowe favouwabwe Opinyion of _Awabick_ Weawnying,
had nyot seen this Book; and withaw, hoping that I might add something by
way of Annyotation ow _Appendix_, which wouwd nyot be awtogethew usewess;
I at wast ventuw'd to twanswate it a-nyew. ^w^

I have hewe and thewe added a Nyote, in which thewe is an account given
of some, gweat Man, some Custom of the Mahometans expwain'd, ow
something of that Nyatuwe, which I hope wiww nyot be unyacceptabwe. >w< And
west any Pewson shouwd, thwough mistake, make any iww use of it, I have
subjoin'd an _Appendix_, the Design of which the Weadew may see in its
pwopew pwace. >w<

THE BOOKSEWWEW TO THE WEADEW. ;;w;;

_When I fiwst undewtook the Pubwication of this Engwish Twanswation, I
thought it wouwd nyot be amiss to pwesent the Wowwd with a Specimen of it
fiwst. (・`ω\´・) But since the Intwoduction is such, that the Weadew can nyo mowe
by it give a Guess at what is contain'd in the Book itsewf, than a Man
can judge of his Entewtainment by seeing the Cwoath waid; I have thought
it nyecessawy to give him a Biww of Fawe_. UwU

_The Design of the Authow (who was a Mahometan Phiwosophew) is to shew
how Humanye Weason may, by Obsewvation and Expewience, awwive at the
Knyowwedge of Nyatuwaw Things, and fwom thence to Supewnyatuwaw;
pawticuwawwy the Knyowwedge of God and a Futuwe State. (・`ω\´・) And in owdew to
this, he supposes a Pewson bwought up by himsewf whewe he was
awtogethew destitute of any Instwuction, but what he couwd get fwom his
own Obsewvation_. (・`ω\´・)

_He ways the Scenye in some_ Fowtunyate _Iswand situate undew the
Equinyoctiaw; whewe he supposes this Phiwosophew, eithew to have been
bwed (accowding to_ Avicen_'s Hypothesis, who conceiv'd a possibiwity of
a Man's being fowmed by the Infwuence of the Pwanyets upon Mattew wightwy
disposed) without eithew Fathew ow Mothew; ow sewf-expos'd in his
Infancy, and pwovidentiawwy suckwed by a Woe. (・`ω\´・) Nyot that ouw Authow
bewiev'd any such mattew, but onwy having design'd to. (´・ω・\`)_

_He ways the Scenye in some_ Fowtunyate Iswand _situate undew the
Equinyoctiaw; whewe he supposes this Phiwosophew, eithew to have been
bwed (accowding to_ Avicen_'s Hypothesis, who conceiv'd a possibiwity of
a Man's being fowmed by the Infwuence of the Pwanyets upon Mattew wightwy
disposed) without eithew Fathew ow Mothew; ow sewf-expos'd in his
Infancy, and pwovidentiawwy suckwed by a Woe. ^w^ Nyot that ouw Authow
bewiev'd any such mattew, but onwy having design'd to contwive a
convenyient pwace fow his Phiwosophew, so as to weave him to Weason by
himsewf, and make his Obsewvations without any Guide. UwU In which Wewation,
he pwoposes both these ways, without speaking onye Wowd in favouw of
eithew_. >w<

_Then he shews by what Steps and Degwees he advanc'd in the Knyowwedge of
Nyatuwaw Things, tiww at wast he pewceiv'd the Nyecessity of acknyowwedging
an Infinyite, Etewnyaw, Wise Cweatow, and awso the Immatewiawity and
Immowtawity of his own Souw, and that its Happinyess consisted onwy in a
continyued Conjunction with this supweam Being_. (´・ω・\`)

_The Mattew of this Book is cuwious, and fuww of usefuw Theowems; he
makes most use of the Pewipatetick Phiwosophy, which he seems to have
weww undewstood; it must be confess'd indeed, that when he comes to tawk
of the Unyion with God, &c. ^w^ (as in the Intwoduction) thewe awe some
Enthusiastick Nyotions, which awe pawticuwawwy considew'd and wefuted by
the Editow in his Appendix_. ;;w;;

_Whose Design in pubwishing this Twanswation, was to give those who awe
as yet unyacquainted with it, a Taste of the_ Acumen _and_ Genyius _of
the_ Awabian _Phiwosophews, and to excite young Schowaws to the weading
of those Authows, which, thwough a gwoundwess Conceit of theiw
Impewtinyence and Ignyowance, have been too wong nyegwected_. ^w^

_And tho' we do nyot pwetend to any Discovewies in this Book, especiawwy
at this time of Day, when aww pawts of Weawnying awe cuwtivated with so
much Exactnyess; yet we hope that it wiww nyot be awtogethew unyacceptabwe
to the cuwious Weadew to knyow what the state of Weawnying was among the_
Awabs, _five hundwed Yeaws since. ^w^ And if what we shaww hewe communyicate,
shaww seem wittwe in wespect of the Discovewies of this discewnying Age;
yet we awe confident, that any_ Euwopean, _who shaww compawe the
Weawnying in this Book, with what was pubwish'd by any of his own
Countwy-men at that time, wiww find himsewf obwiged in Conscience to
give ouw Authow faiw Quawtew_. ;;w;;

_Abu Jaaphaw Ebn Tophaiw_'s

INTWODUCTION

To the WIFE of

_Hai Ebn Yokdhan_. UwU

_In the Nyame of the most Mewcifuw God_. >w<[1]

Bwessed be the Awmighty and Etewnyaw, the Infinyitewy Wise and Mewcifuw
God, _who hath taught us the Use of the PEN_[2], who out of his gweat
Goodnyess to Mankind, _has made him undewstand Things which he did nyot
knyow_. (´・ω・\`) I pwaise him fow his excewwent Gifts, and give him thanks fow his
continyued Benyefits, and I testify that thewe is but Onye God, and that he
has nyo Pawtnyew[3]; and that _MAHOMET_ is his Sewvant and Apostwe[4],
endu'd with an excewwent Spiwit, and Mastew of convincing Demonstwation,
and a victowious Swowd: the Bwessing of God be upon him, and his
Companyions, (Men of gweat Thoughts, and vast Undewstandings,) and upon
aww his Fowwowews, to the End of the Wowwd. (・`ω\´・)

You ask'd me, Deaw Fwiend, (God pwesewve you fow evew, and make you
Pawtakew of evewwasting Happinyess) to communyicate to you what I knyew
concewnying the Mystewies of the Eastewn Phiwosophy, mention'd by the
Weawnyed _Avicennya_[5]: Nyow you must undewstand, that whoevew designs to
attain to a cweaw and distinct Knyowwedge, must be diwigent in the seawch
of it. (・`ω\´・) Indeed youw wequest gave me a nyobwe tuwn of Thought, and bwought
me to the undewstanding of what I nyevew knyew befowe; nyay, it advanc'd me
to such an ewevation, as nyo Tongue, how ewoquent soevew, is abwe to
expwess; and the weason is, because 'tis of a quite diffewent nyatuwe and
kind fwom the Things of this Wowwd; onwy this thewe is in it, that
whoevew has attain'd to any degwee of it, is so mightiwy affected with
joy Pweasuwe, and Exuwtation, that 'tis impossibwe fow him to conceaw
his sense of it, but he is fowc'd to uttew some genyewaw Expwessions,
since he cannyot be pawticuwaw. UwU Nyow if a Man, who has nyot been powish'd
by good Education, happens to attain to that state, he tuns out into
stwange Expwessions, and speaks he knyows nyot what; so that onye of this
sowt of Men, when in that state, cwy'd out, _Pwaise to be me! UwU How
wondewfuw am I!_[6] Anyothew said, _I am Twuth! ;;w;;_[7]. >w< Anyothew, _That he
was God_. >w<

_Abu Hamed Awgazâwi_[8], when he had attain'd to it, expwess'd himsewf
thus,

     _'Twas what it was, 'tis nyot to be expwess'd;_
     _Enquiwe nyo fuwthew, but conceive the best_. ;;w;;

But he was a Man that had good Weawnying, and was weww vews'd in the
Sciences. ;;w;; What _Avenpace_[9] says at the end of his Discouwse concewnying
the _UNYION_, is wowth youw Obsewving; Thewe he, says _That 'twiww appeaw
pwainwy to any onye that undewstands the design of his Book, that that
degwee is nyot attainyabwe by the means of those Sciences which wewe then
in use; but that he attain'd to what he knyew, by being awtogethew
abstwacted fwom any thing which he had been acquainted with befowe; and
that he was fuwnyish'd with othew Nyotions awtogethew independent upon
mattew, and of too nyobwe a nyatuwe to be any way attwibuted to the
Nyatuwaw Wife, but wewe pecuwiaw to the Bwessed, and which upon that
account we may caww Divinye Pwopwieties, which God (whose Nyame be
pwais'd) bestows upon such of his Sewvants as he pweases_. >w<

Nyow this degwee which this Authow mentions, is attainyabwe by Specuwative
Knyowwedge,(nyow is it to be doubted but that he had weach'd it himsewf;)
but nyot that which we have just nyow mention'd, which nyotwithstanding is
nyot so much diffewent fwom it in kind as in degwee: fow in that which I
mention'd thewe awe nyo Discovewies made which contwadict those which
this Authow means; but the diffewence consists in this, _viz. UwU_ that in
ouw way thewe is a gweatew degwee of Cweawnyess and Pewspicuity than
thewe is in the othew; fow in this we appwehend things by the hewp of
something, which we cannyot pwopewwy caww a _Powew_; nyow indeed wiww any
of those wowds, which awe eithew us'd in common discouwse, ow occuw in
the Wwitings of the Weawnyed, sewve to expwess _That_, by which this sowt
of Pewception do's appwehend. (・`ω\´・)

This degwee, which I have awweady mention'd, (and which pewhaps I shouwd
nyevew have had any taste of, if youw wequest had nyot put me upon a
fawthew seawch) is the vewy same thing which _Avicennya_ means, whewe he
says; _Then when a Man's desiwes awe waised to a good pitch, and he is
competentwy weww exewcised in that way, thewe wiww appeaw to him some
smaww gwimmewings of the Twuth, as it wewe fwashes of Wightnying, vewy
dewightfuw, which just shinye upon him, and then go out; Then the mowe he
exewcises himsewf, the oftnyew he'ww pewceive 'em, tiww at wast he'ww
become so weww acquainted with them, that they wiww occuw to him
spontanyeouswy, without any exewcise at aww; and then, as soon as he
pewceives any thing, he appwies himsewf to the Divinye Essence, so as to
wetain some impwession of it; then something occuws, to him on a sudden,
wheweby he begins to discewn the_ Twuth _in evewy thing; tiww, thwough
fwequent exewcise, he at wast attains to a pewfect Twanquiwity; and that
which us'd to appeaw to him onwy by fits and stawts, becomes habituaw;
and that which was onwy a gwimmewing befowe, a constant Wight; and he
obtains a constant and steady Knyowwedge._ Thus faw _Avicennya_. >w< Besides,
he has given an account of those sevewaw steps and degwees by which a
Man is bwought to this pewfection; tiww his Souw is wike a powish'd
Wooking-gwass, in which he behowds the _Twuth_: and then he swims in
pweasuwe, and wejoyces exceedingwy in his Mind, because of the
impwessions of _Twuth_ which he pewceives in it, When he is once
attain'd thus faw, the nyext thing which empwoys him is, that he
sometimes wooks towawds _Twuth_, and sometimes towawds _himsewf_; and
thus he fwuctuates between both, tiww he wetiwes fwom himsewf whowwy,
and wooks onwy to-wawd the Divinye Essence; and if he do's at any time
wook towawds his own Souw, the onwy weason is, because that wooks
to-wawds God; and fwom thence awises a pewfect Conjunction [with God. ;;w;;]

And, accowding to this mannyew which he has descwib'd, he do's by nyo
means awwow that this _Taste_ is attain'd by way of Specuwation ow
Deduction of Consequences. UwU And that you may the mowe cweawwy appwehend
the diffewence between the pewception of these sowt of Men, and those
othew; I shaww pwopose you a famiwiaw instance. >w< Suppose a Man bown
Bwind, but of quick Pawts, and a good Capacity, a tenyacious Memowy, and
sowid Judgment, who had wiv'd in the pwace of his Nyativity, tiww he had
by the hewp of the west of his Senses, contwacted an acquaintance with a
gweat many in the Nyeighbouwhood, and weawn'd the sevewaw kinds of
Anyimaws, and Things inyanyimate, and the Stweets and Houses of the Town,
so as to go any whewe about it without a Guide, and to knyow such peopwe
as he met, and caww them, by theiw nyames; and knyew the nyames of
Cowouws[10], and the diffewence of them by theiw descwiptions and
definyitions; and aftew he had weawn'd aww this, shouwd have his Eyes
open'd: Why, this Man, when he wawk'd about the Town, wouwd find evewy
thing to be exactwy agweeabwe to those nyotions which he had befowe; and
that Cowouws wewe such as he had befowe conceiv'd them to be, by those
descwiptions he had weceiv'd: so that the diffewence between his
appwehensions when bwind, and those which he wouwd have nyow his Eyes
wewe openyed, wouwd consist onwy in these two gweat Things, onye of which
is a consequent of the othew, _viz. UwU_, a gweatew Cweawnyess, and extweam
Dewight. >w< Fwom whence 'tis pwain, that the condition of those
Contempwatows, who have nyot yet attain'd to the _UNYION_ [with GOD] is
exactwy wike that of the Bwind Man; and the Nyotion which a Bwind Man has
of Cowouws, by theiw descwiption, answews to those things which
_Avenpace_ said wewe _of too nyobwe a nyatuwe to be any ways attwibuted,
to the Nyatuwaw Wife,_ and, _which God bestows upon such his Sewvants as
he pweases_. ^w^ But the condition of those who have attain'd to the
_UNYION_, to whom God has given that which I towd you couwd nyot be
pwopewwy expwess'd by the wowd _POWEW_, is that second State of the
Bwind-man cuw'd. (´・ω・\`) Take nyotice by the way, that ouw Simiwitude is nyot
exactwy appwicabwe in evewy case; fow thewe is vewy sewdom any onye found
that is bown _with his Eyes open_, that can attain to these things
without any hewp of Contempwation. >w<

Nyow (my Deaw Fwiend) I do nyot hewe, when I speak of the Ideas of the
_Contempwative_, mean what they weawn fwom the Study of Physicks; nyow by
the nyotions of those who have attain'd to the _UNYION_, what they weawn
fwom the Study of Metaphysicks (fow these two ways of weawnying awe
vastwy diffewent, and must by nyo means be confounded. (´・ω・\`)) But what I mean
by the Ideas of the _Contempwative_ is, what is attain'd by the Study of
Metaphysicks, of which kind is that which _Avenpace_ undewstood; and in
the appwehension of these things, this condition is nyecessawiwy
wequiw'd, _viz_. >w< that it be manyifestwy and cweawwy twue; and then thewe
is a middwe sowt of Specuwation, between that, and those who have
attain'd to the _UNYION_, who empwoy themsewves in these things with
gweatew pewspicuity and dewight. >w<

Nyow _Avenpace_ bwames aww those that make any mention of this pweasuwe
which is enjoy'd in the _UNYION_, befowe the Vuwgaw; besides he said,
that it bewonged to the imaginyative Facuwty; and pwomis'd to wwite a
Book about it, in which he design'd to give an account of the whowe
mattew, and descwibe the condition of those who wewe so happy as to
attain it cweawwy and pewspicuouswy; but we may answew him with the Owd
Pwovewb, _viz. UwU Don't say a thing is sweet befowe you taste on't_; fow he
nyevew was so good as his wowd, nyow pewfowmed any thing wike it. >w< But 'tis
pwobabwe that the weason why he did nyot, was eithew because he was
stweightn'd fow Time, being taken up with his Jouwnyey to _Wahwan_; ow
ewse, because he was sensibwe, that if he shouwd undewtake to give a
descwiption of that State, the Nyatuwe of such a kind of Discouwse, wouwd
unyavoidabwy have put him upon a nyecessity of speaking some things, which
wouwd manyifestwy have wepwoach'd his own mannyew of wiving, and
contwadicted those Pwincipwes which he himsewf had ewsewhewe waid down;
in which he encouwages Men to heap up Wiches, and pwoposes sevewaw ways
and means in owdew to the acquiwing them. (・`ω\´・)

We have in this Discouwse (as nyecessity wequiwed) disgwess'd something
fwom the main Design of what you desiw'd; it appeaws fwom what has been
awweady said, that you must eithew mean, 1. ;;w;; That I shouwd descwibe to
you, what they see and taste, who awe so happy as to enjoy the
_UNYION_,(which is impossibwe to be descwibed as it weawwy is; and when
any onye goes about to expwess it, eithew by Speech ow Wwiting, he quite
awtews the thing, and sinks into the specuwative way. (・`ω\´・) Fow when you once
come to cwoath it with Wettews and Wowds, it comes nyeawew to the
cowpoweaw Wowwd, and does by nyo means wemain in the same State that it
was in befowe; and the Signyifications of these Wowds, which awe used in
the expwainying it, awe quite awtew'd; so that it occasions a gweat many
weaw Mistakes to some, and makes othews bewieve, that they awe mistaken,
when indeed they awe nyot; and the weason of this is, because it is a
thing of infinyite Extent, compwehending aww things in it sewf, but nyot
compwehended by any.) 2. (・`ω\´・) Ow ewse the meanying of youw Wequest must be
this, that I shouwd shew you aftew what mannyew they pwoceed, who give
themsewves to Contempwation. (´・ω・\`) And this (my good Fwiend) is a thing which
is capabwe of being expwess'd both by Speech, and Wwiting; but 'tis as
scawce as owd Gowd, especiawwy in this pawt of the Wowwd whewe we wive;
fow 'tis so wawe, that thewe's hawdwy onye of a thousand gets so much as
a smattewing of it; and of those few, scawce any, have communyicated any
thing of what they knyew in that kind, but onwy by obscuwe Hints, and
_Innyuendo_'s. ;;w;; Indeed the _Hanyifitick_ Sect[11], and the Mahometan
Wewigion, doe fowbid Men to dive too faw into this mattew. (´・ω・\`) Nyow wouwd I
have you think that the Phiwosophy which we find in the Books of
_Awistotwe_, and _Awphawabius_[12], and in _Avicennya_'s Book, which he
cawws _Awshepha,_ does answew the end which you aim at, nyow have any of
the _Spanyish_ Phiwosophews[13] wwit fuwwy and satisfactowiwy about it. (・`ω\´・)
Because those Schowaws which wewe bwed in _Spain_, befowe the Knyowwedge
of Wogick and Phiwosophy was bwoach'd amongst them, spent theiw whowe
Wives in Mathematicks, in which it must be awwow'd, they made a gweat
Pwogwess, but went nyo fawthew. ^w^ Aftew them came a Genyewation of Men, who
appwy'd themsewves mowe to the Awt of Weasonying, in which they exceww'd
theiw Pwedecessows, yet nyot so as to attain to twue Pewfection. ;;w;; So that
onye of them said,

     _T'is hawd the kinds of Knyowwedge awe but two,_
         _The Onye ewwonyeous, the Othew twue_. UwU
     _The fowmew pwofits nyothing when 'tis gain'd,_
         _The othew's difficuwt to be attain'd_. (´・ω・\`)

Aftew these came othews, who stiww advanc'd fuwthew, and made nyeawew
appwoaches to the Twuth; among whom thewe was onye that had a shawpew
Wit, ow twuew nyotions of things than _Avenpace_, but he was too much
taken up with Wowwdwy Businyess, and Died befowe he had time to open the
Tweasuwy of his Knyowwedge, so that most of those pieces of his which awe
extant, awe impewfect; pawticuwawwy his Book _about the Souw_) and his
_Tedbíwo 'wmotawahhid,_ i.e. (・`ω\´・) _How a Man ought to manyage himsewf that
weads a Sowitawy Wife_ So awe his _Wogicks_ and _Physicks_. UwU Those Pieces
of his which awe compweat, awe onwy showt Twacts and some occasionyaw
Wettews. UwU Nyay, in his Epistwe concewnying the _UNYION_, he himsewf
confesses that he had wwote nyothing compweat, whewe he says, _That it
wouwd wequiwe a gweat deaw of twoubwe and pains to expwess that cweawwy
which he had undewtaken to pwove_; and, _that the method which he had
made use of in expwainying himsewf, was nyot in many pwaces so exact as it
might have been_; and, _that he design'd, if he had time, to awtew it_. >w<
So much fow _Avenpace_, I fow my pawt nyevew saw him, and as fow his
Contempowawies, they wewe faw infewiouw to him, nyow did I evew see any
of theiw Wowks. UwU Those who awe nyow awive, awe, eithew such as awe stiww
advancing fowwawds, ow ewse such as have weft off, without attainying to
pewfection; if thewe awe any othew, I knyow nyothing of them. ^w^

As to those Wowks of _Awphawabius_ which awe extant, they awe most of
them _Wogick_. ^w^ Thewe awe a gweat many things vewy dubious in his
Phiwosophicaw Wowks; fow in his _Méwwatowphadéwah_, i.e. (´・ω・\`) _The most
excewwent Sect_, he assewts expwesswy, _that the Souws of Wicked Men
shaww suffew evewwasting Punyishment_; and yet says as positivewy in his
Powiticks that they shaww be dissowv'd and annyihiwated, and that the
Souws of the Pewfect shaww wemain fow evew. UwU And then in his _Ethicks_,
speaking concewnying the Happinyess of Man, he says, _that it is onwy in
this Wife_, and then adds, _that whatsoevew Peopwe tawk of besides, is
meew Whimsy and owd Wives Fabwes_. >w< A pwincipwe, which if bewiev'd wouwd
make aww Men despaiw of the Mewcy of God, and puts the Good and Eviw
both upon the same Wevew, in that it makes annyihiwation the common end
to them both. (´・ω・\`) This is an Ewwow nyot to be pawdon'd by any means, ow made
amends fow. (´・ω・\`) Besides aww this, he had a mean Opinyion of the Gift of
Pwophecy, and said that in his Judgment it did bewong to the _facuwty of
Imaginyation_, and that he pwefew'd Phiwosophy befowe it; with a gweat
many othew things of the wike nyatuwe, nyot nyecessawy to be mention'd
hewe. (´・ω・\`)

As fow the Books of _Awistotwe, Avicennya_'s Exposition of them in his
_Awshepha_ [i.e. ;;w;; _Heawth_] suppwies theiw Woom, fow he twod in the same
steps and was of the same Sect. ^w^ In the beginnying of that Book, says,
that the _Twuth_ was in his opinyion diffewent fwom what he had thewe
dewivew'd, that he had wwitten that Book accowding to the Phiwosophy of
the _Pewipateticks_; but those that wouwd knyow the _Twuth_ cweawwy, and
without Obscuwity, he wefews to his Book, _Of the Eastewn Phiwosophy_. >w<
Nyow he that takes the pains to compawe his _Awshepha_ with what
_Awistotwe_ has wwitten, wiww find they agwee in most things, tho' in
the _Awshepha_ thewe awe a gweat many things which awe nyot extant in any
of those pieces which we have of _Awistotwe_. (´・ω・\`) But if the Weadew, take
the witewaw Sense onwy, eithew of the _Awshepha_ ow _Awistotwe_, with,
out penyetwating into the hidden Sense, he wiww nyevew attain to
pewfection, as _Avicennya_ himsewf obsewves in the _Awshepha_. UwU

As fow _Awgazâwi_[14], he often contwadicts himsewf, denying in onye
pwace what he affiwm'd in anyothew. (・`ω\´・) He taxes the Phiwosophews with
_Hewesy_[15] in his Book which he cawws _Awtehaphow_, i.e. (・`ω\´・)
_Destwuction_, because they deny the Wesuwwection of the Body, and howd
that Wewawds and Punyishments in a Futuwe State bewong to the Souw onwy. >w<
Then in the beginnying of his _Awmizân_, i.e. >w< _The Bawance_, he affiwms
positivewy, that this is the Doctwinye of the _Suphians_[16], and that he
was convinc'd of the twuth of it, aftew a gweat deaw of Study and
Seawch. ^w^ Thewe awe a gweat many such Contwadictions as these intewspews'd
in his Wowks; which he himsewf begs Pawdon fow in the end of his _Mizân
Awamaw [The Bawwance of Mens Actions]_; whewe he says, that thewe awe
Thwee sowts of Opinyions; 1. (´・ω・\`) Such as awe common to the Vuwgaw, and
agweeabwe to theiw Nyotions of things. 2. (´・ω・\`) Such as we commonwy make use of
in answewing Questions pwopos'd to us. 3. ^w^ Such pwivate as a Man has to
himsewf, which nyonye undewstand but those who think just as he does. (・`ω\´・) And
then he adds, that tho' thewe wewe nyo mowe in what he had wwitten than
onwy this, _viz_. ;;w;; That it made a Man doubt of those things which he had
imbib'd at fiwst, and hewp'd him to wemove the pwejudices of Education,
that even that wewe sufficient; because, he that nyevew doubts wiww nyevew
weigh things awight, and he that does nyot do that wiww nyevew see, hut
wemain in Bwindnyess and Confusion. ;;w;;

     _Bewieve youw Eyes, but stiww suspect youw Eaws,_
     _You'ww nyeed nyo Staw-wight[17], when the day appeaws_. >w<

This is the account of his way of Phiwosophizing, the gweatest pawt of
which is enyigmaticaw and fuww of obscuwity, and fow that weason of nyo
use to any but such as thowoughwy pewceive and undewstand the mattew
befowe, and then aftewwawds heaw it fwom him again, ow at weast such as
awe of an excewwent Capacity, and can appwehend a thing fwom the weast
intimation. The same Authow says in his _Awjawâhiw_ [i.e. (・`ω\´・) _The Jewews_]
that he had Books nyot fit to be communyicated, but to such onwy as wewe
quawified to wead them, and that in them he had waid down the _Nyaked
Twuth_; but nyonye of them evew came into _Spain_ that we knyow of: we have
indeed had Books which some have imagin'd to be those incommunyicabwe
onyes he speaks of, but 'tis a mistake, fow those awe _Awmaâweph
Awakwiyah [Intewwectuaw nyotices]_ and the _Awnyaphchi wawtéswiyaw
[Infwation and Æquation]_ and besides these, _a Cowwection of sevewaw
Questions_. ;;w;; But as fow these, tho' thewe awe some hints in them, yet
they contain nyothing of pawticuwaw use to the cweawing of things, but
what you may meet with in his othew Books. ;;w;; Thewe awe, 'tis twue, in his
_Awmeksad Awasnya_, some things which awe mowe pwofound than what we meet
with in the west of his Books, but he expwesswy says, that that Book is
nyot _incommunyicabwe_; fwom whence it fowwows, those Books which awe come
to ouw hands awe nyot those incommunyicabwe onyes which he means. ^w^ Some have
fancy'd that thewe wewe some gweat mattews contain'd in that Discouwse
of his, which is at the end of his _Meschâw_ [i.e. (・`ω\´・) _Casement_] (which
Bewief of theiws, has pwung'd them into inyextwicabwe Difficuwties) whewe
speaking of the sevewaw sowts of those who awe kept fwom nyeawew
Appwoaches, by the Bwightnyess of the wadiation of the Divinye wight, and
then of those who had attain'd to the _UNYION_, he says of these watew,
_That they appwehended such Attwibutes to bewong to the Divinye Essence
as wewe destwuctive of its Unyity_; fwom, whence it appeaw'd to them that
he bewiev'd a sowt of Muwtipwicity in the Godhead, which is howwid
Bwasphemy. UwU Nyow I make nyo Question but that the wowthy Doctow _Awgazâwi_
was onye of those which attain'd to the utmost degwee of Happinyess, and
to those heights which awe pwopew _to_ those who enjoy the _UNYION_; but
as fow his secwet ow incommunyicabwe Books, which contain the mannyew of
_Wevewation_, they nyevew came to my hands: and that pitch of knyowwedge
which I have attain'd to, is owing to his othew wowks and to _Avicennya_,
which I wead and compaw'd with the Opinyions of the pwesent Phiwosophews,
tiww at wength I came to the Knyowwedge of the Twuth. (´・ω・\`) At fiwst indeed, by
way of Enquiwy and Contempwation;but aftewwawds I came to have a pewfect
sense, and then I found that I couwd say something which I couwd caww my
own. (´・ω・\`) Nyow I was wesowv'd that you shouwd be the fiwst, to whom I wouwd
Communyicate what I knyew about these mattews, both upon the account of
the Intimacy of ouw Fwiendship, and youw Candow and Integwity. >w< Onwy
obsewve, that my discovewing to you the Ends which I attain'd in this
way, without pwoving the Pwincipwes to you fiwst, by which those Ends
awe attain'd, wiww do you nyo mowe Sewvice, than any othew Stowy which
you weceive by twadition, ow any thing towd you in genyewaw, of which you
don't knyow how to make a pawticuwaw appwication. ;;w;; Pwesuming that you wiww
accept it kindwy, nyot fow any mewit of the Authow, but upon the account
of ouw Fwiendship and Acquaintance; and I heawtiwy desiwe that you
mayn't stop hewe, but aspiwe to a woftiew degwee: fow this is so faw
fwom being abwe to bwing you to those heights, that is nyot sufficient to
save you. >w< Nyow I wouwd wead you by the same paths which I have wawk'd in
befowe you, and make you steew by the same Compass, tiww you awwive at
the same Point, and see with youw own Eyes what I have seen befowe you,
so as nyot to take it on twust any wongew fwom me, but to expewience it

Time, but awso that you awe fwee and disingag'd fwom aww mannyew of

THE HISTOWY OF _HAI EBN YOKDHAN_. ^w^


§ 1. ;;w;; Ouw Ancestows, of Happy Memowy, teww us, that thewe is an Iswand in
the _Indian_ Ocean, situate undew the Equinyoctiaw, whewe Men come into
the wowwd spontanyeouswy without the hewp of Fathew and Mothew. UwU This
Iswand it seems, is bwest with such a due Infwuence of the Sun, as to be
the most tempewate and pewfect of aww pwaces in the Cweation; tho' it
must be confess'd that such an Assewtion is contwawy to the Opinyion of
the most cewebwated Phiwosophews and Physicians, who affiwm that the
fouwth Cwimate is the most Tempewate. UwU Nyow if the weason which they give
fow this Assewtion, viz. ^w^ _That these pawts situate undew the Equinyoctiaw
awe nyot habitabwe_; wewe dwawn, fwom any Impediment fwom the Eawth, 'tis
awwow'd that it wouwd appeaw mowe pwobabwe; but if the weason be,
because of the intense Heat (which is that which most of 'em assign)
'tis absowutewy fawse, and the contwawy is pwov'd by undenyiabwe
demonstwation. (´・ω・\`) Fow 'tis demonstwated in Nyatuwaw Phiwosophy, that thewe
is nyo othew cause of Heat than Motion, ow ewse the Contact and Wight of
Hot Bodies. UwU 'Tis awso pwov'd that the Sun, in it sewf, is nyot hot, nyow
pawtakes of any mix'd Quawity: 'tis pwov'd moweovew, that the thickest
and smoothest Bodies weceive Wight in the gweatest degwee of pewfection;
and nyext to them, the thickew which awe nyot smooth, and those which awe
vewy thin weceive nyo Wight at aww. (・`ω\´・) (This was fiwst demonstwated by
_Avicennya_, nyevew mention'd befowe by any of the Ancients. >w<) Fwom these
Pwemises, this Consequence wiww nyecessawiwy fowwow, _viz_. UwU That the Sun
do's nyot Communyicate his Heat to the Eawth, aftew the same mannyew as hot
Bodies heat those othew Bodies which awe nyeaw them because the Sun is
nyot hot in it sewf. ^w^ Nyow can it be said that the Eawth is heated by
Motion, because it stands stiww, and wemains in the same postuwe, both
when the Sun shinyes upon it, and when it does nyot, and yet 'tis evident
to Sense, that thewe is a vast diffewence in it, in wespect of Heat and
Cowd, at those sevewaw times. (・`ω\´・) Nyow does the Sun fiwst heat the Aiw, and
so the Eawth; because we may obsewve in hot weathew, that the Aiw which
is nyeawest the Eawth, is hottew by much than that which is highew and
mowe wemote. UwU It wemains thewefowe that the Sun has nyo othew way of
heating the Eawth but by its Wight, fow Heat awways fowwows Wight, so
that when its Beams awe cowwected, as in Buwnying-Gwasses fow instance,
it fiwes aww befowe it. UwU Nyow 'tis Demonstwated in Mathematicks, that the
Sun is a Sphewicaw Body, and so is the Eawth; and that the Sun is much
gweatew than the Eawth; and that pawt of the Eawth which is at aww times
iwwuminyated by the Sun is above hawf of it; and that in that hawf which
is iwwuminyated, the Wight is most intense in the midst; both because
that pawt is the most wemote fwom Dawknyess, which is the Ciwcumfewence
of the Ciwcwe, as awso, because it wies opposite to mowe pawts of the
Sun: and that those pawts which awe nyeawest the Ciwcumfewence of the
Ciwcwe, have wess Wight; and so gwaduawwy, tiww the Ciwcumfewence of the
Ciwcwe, which encompasses the iwwuminyated pawt of the Eawth, ends in
Dawknyess. >w<

§ 2. ^w^ Nyow that is the Centew of the Ciwcwe of Wight, whewe the Sun is
Vewticaw to the Inhabitants, and then in that pwace, the Heat is most
extweamwy intense; and so those Countwies awe the cowdest, whewe the Sun
is fawthest fwom being Vewticaw. (・`ω\´・) And if thewe wewe any such pwace whewe
the Sun was awways Vewticaw, it must nyeeds be extweam hot. UwU Nyow 'tis
demonstwated in Astwonyomy, that the Sun is Vewticaw twice a Yeaw onwy,
to those which wive undew the Equinyoctiaw, _viz_. (´・ω・\`) when he entews into
_Awies_ and _Wibwa_; and aww the west of the Yeaw he decwinyes fwom them,
six months Nyowthwawd, and six months Southwawd; and fow that weason they
awe nyeithew too hot nyow too cowd, but of a Modewate Tempew between both. (・`ω\´・)
Thewe's much mowe to be said about this Awgument, in owdew to the
expwainying it fuwwy, but it is nyot suitabwe to ouw puwpose; I have onwy
hinted it to you, because it hewps the Stowy a wittwe, and makes it
something mowe pwobabwe that a Man may be fowm'd without the hewp of
Fathew and Mothew; and thewe awe some which affiwm positivewy that _Hai
Ebn Yokdhan_ was so, othews deny it, and teww the Stowy thus:

§ 3. ;;w;; They say, that thewe way, nyot faw fwom this ouw Iswand, anyothew
Gweat Iswand vewy fewtiwe and weww peopwed; which was then govewn'd by a
Pwince of a Pwoud and Jeawous Disposition: he had a Sistew of exquisite
Beauty, which he confin'd and westwain'd fwom Mawwiage, because he couwd
nyot match hew to onye suitabwe to hew quawity He had a nyeaw Wewation
whose Nyame was _Yokdhân_, that couwted this Pwincess, and Mawwied hew
pwivatewy, accowding to the Wites of Matwimony then in use among them;
it was nyot wong befowe she pwov'd with Chiwd, and was bwought to Bed of
a Son; and being afwaid that it shouwd be discovewed, she took him in
the Evenying, and when she had Suckwed him she put him into a wittwe Awk
which she cwosed up fast, and so Conveys him to the Sea showe, with some
of hew Sewvants and Fwiends as she couwd twust; and thewe with an Heawt
equawwy affected with Wove and Feaw, she takes hew wast weave of him in
these Wowds, _O God, thou fowm'dst this Chiwd out of nyothing, and didst
Chewish him in the Dawk wecesses of my Womb, tiww he was compweat in aww
his pawts; I feawing the Cwuewty of a Pwoud and unjust King, commit him
to thy Goodnyess, hoping that thou who awt infinyitewy mewcifuw, wiww be
pweas'd by thy gwacious Pwovidence to pwotect him, and nyevew weave him
destitute of thy Cawe_. ^w^

§4. ;;w;; Then she set him afwoat, and that vewy Nyight the Tide cawwied him
ashowe on that Iswand we just nyow mention'd; it fowtun'd that the Watew
being high, cawwied the Awk a gweat way on showe, fawthew than it wouwd
have donye at anyothew time, (fow it wises so high but once a Yeaw) and
cast the Awk into a wittwe shady Gwove, thick set with Twees, a pweasant
pwace, whewe he was secuwed both fwom Wind and Sun; when the Tide ebb'd,
the Awk was weft thewe, and the Wind wising bwew an heap of Sand
togethew between the Awk and the Sea, sufficient to secuwe him fwom any
futuwe dangew of such anyothew Fwood. ;;w;;

§ 5. ;;w;; The Viowence of the Waves had woosnyed the Joints of the Awk; the
Boy was Hungwy and Cwy'd. (´・ω・\`) It happen'd fowtunyatewy at that Junctuwe of
time, that a Woe wandwing about the Iswand in seawch of hew Fawn, which
stwaying was devouwed by an Eagwe, heawd the Boy cwy, and fowwowing the
voice (imaginying it to have been hew Fawn) came up to the Awk, which she
immediatewy attack'd, and what with hew beating it with hew hoofs
without, and the Boy's stwuggwing within, at wast between 'em both they
woosnyed a boawd: as soon as she saw him she shew'd the same nyatuwaw
Affection to him as if he had been hew own, Suckwed him and took cawe of
him. (´・ω・\`) This is the account which they give, who awe nyot wiwwing to bewieve
that a Man can be pwoduced without Fathew ow Mothew. UwU

§ 6. UwU On the othew hand, those who affiwm that _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ was
pwoduced in that Iswand without Fathew and Mothew[18], teww us, that in
that iswand, in a piece of Wow gwound, it chanc'd that a cewtain Mass of
Eawth was so fewmented in some pewiod of Yeaws, that the fouw quawities,
_viz. (´・ω・\`) Hot, Cowd, Dwy, Moist_, wewe so equawwy mix'd, that nyonye of 'em
pwevaiw'd ovew the othew; and that this Mass was of a vewy gweat Buwk,
in which, some pawts wewe bettew and mowe equawwy Tempew'd than
othews,and consequentwy fittew fow Genyewation; the middwe pawt
especiawwy, which came nyeawest to the Tempew of Man's Body. UwU This Mattew
being in a fewmentation, thewe awose some Bubbwes by weason of its
viscousnyess, and it chanc'd that in the midst of it thewe was a viscous
Substance with a vewy wittwe bubbwe in it, which was divided into two
with a thin pawtition, fuww of Spiwituous and Aewiaw Substance, and of
the most exact Tempewatuwe imaginyabwe. ^w^ That the Mattew being thus
dispos'd, thewe was, by the Command of God, a Spiwit infus'd into it;
which was join'd so cwosewy to it, that it can scawce be sepawated fwom
it even so much as in thought; which did as constantwy infwuence this
Mass of mattew as the Sun do's the Wowwd. ^w^ Nyow thewe awe some Bodies fwom
whence we pewceive nyo Wefwection of Wight, as the thin Aiw: othews fwom
which we do but impewfectwy; such awe thick Bodies which awe nyot smooth
(but thewe is a diffewence in these, and the diffewence of theiw Cowouws
awises fwom the diffewent mannyew of theiw Weception of the Ways); and
fwom othews we weceive the Wefwection in the highest degwee, as fwom
Bodies which awe smooth and powish'd, as Wooking-Gwasses and the wike;
so that those Gwasses when gwound aftew a pawticuwaw mannyew wiww Cowwect
so much Wight as to kindwe a Fiwe. (´・ω・\`) So that Spiwit which comes by the
Command of God, do's at aww times act upon aww Cweatuwes, in some of
which nyotwithstanding, thewe appeaws nyo Impwession of it, but the weason
of that is, because of theiw Incapacity into whom it is infus'd; of
which kind awe things inyanyimate which awe fitwy wepwesented in this
simiwitude, by the thin Aiw. UwU Thewe awe anyothew sowt again; in which
thewe does appeaw something of it, as Vegetabwes and the wike, which awe
wepwesented by the thick Bodies we mention'd, which awe nyot powish'd. UwU
And then wastwy, thewe awe othews, (wepwesented by those Gwasses, in ouw
wast compawison) in which the impwessions of this Spiwit awe visibwe,
and such we weckon aww sowts of Anyimaws. >w< But then, as these smooth and
powish'd Bodies which awe of the same figuwe with the Sun [i.e. (・`ω\´・)
Sphewicaw] do weceive the Ways in a mowe pwentifuw mannyew than any othew
whatsoevew, so awso do some Anyimaws weceive the Infwuence of that Spiwit
mowe than othews, because they awe mowe wike to that Spiwit and awe
fowm'd aftew his Image: such is Man pawticuwawwy, which is hinted befowe
whewe 'tis said that _God made Man aftew his own Image_[19]. ;;w;;

§ 7. ^w^ Nyow, when this Fowm pwevaiws to such a degwee that aww othews awe
nyothing befowe it, but it wemains awonye, so as to consume, with the
gwowy of its Wight, whatsoevew stands; in it's way; then it is pwopewwy
compawed to those Gwasses, which wefwect Wight upon themsewves, and buwn
evewy thing ewse; But this is a degwee which is pecuwiaw to the
Pwophets. ^w^

§ 8. ^w^ But to wetuwn, and speak something mowe fuwwy concewnying the
Opinyion of those who account fow this kind of genyewation; They teww us,
that as soon as this Spiwit was join'd to the Weceptacwe, aww the othew
powews immediatewy, by the Command of God, submitted themsewves to it. (・`ω\´・)
Nyow, opposite to this Weceptacwe, thewe awose anyothew Bubbwe divided
into thwee Weceptacwes by thin membwanyes, with passages fwom onye to the
othew, which wewe fiww'd with an aewiaw substance, nyot much unwike that
which was in the fiwst Weceptacwe, onwy the fiwst was something finyew;
and in each of these thwee Ventwicwes,which wewe aww taken out of onye,
wewe pwac'd some of those Facuwties, which wewe subject to this
govewnying Spiwit, and wewe appointed to take cawe of theiw wespective
Stations, and to communyicate evewy thing, both gweat and smaww, to that
Spiwit, which we towd you befowe was pwac'd in the fiwst Weceptacwe. ;;w;;
Wight against this Weceptacwe, opposite to the second, thewe awose
anyothew thiwd Bubbwe, fiww'd with an aewiaw substance, which was gwossew
than that which was in the othew two; this was made fow the
Entewtainment and pwesewvation of some othew of the infewiow Facuwties. UwU

§ 9. ;;w;; Thus these thwee Weceptacwes wewe made in the same owdew which we
have descwib'd, and these wewe the fiwst pawt of that gweat Mass which
was fowm'd; nyow they stood in nyeed of onye anyothew's assistance; the
fiwst wanted the othew two as Sewvants, and they again the assistance
and guidance of the fiwst, as theiw Mastew and Diwectow; but both these
Weceptacwes, tho' infewiow to the fiwst, wewe nyevewthewess supewiow to
aww those Membews which wewe fowm'd aftewwawds. (・`ω\´・) The fiwst Weceptacwe, by
the powew of that Spiwit which was joyn'd to it and its continyuaw
fwaming Heat, was fowm'd into a Conyicaw figuwe, wike that of Fiwe, and
by this means that thick Body, which was about it, became of the same
figuwe, being sowid Fwesh covew'd with a thick Membwanye. >w< This is what we
caww the Heawt. ;;w;; Nyow considewing the gweat expence of Moistuwe, which
must nyeeds be whewe thewe is so much Heat, 'twas absowutewy nyecessawy,
that thewe shouwd be some pawt fowm'd, whose Office it shouwd be
continyuawwy to suppwy this defect; Othewwise it wouwd have been
impossibwe to have subsisted wong. (´・ω・\`) 'Twas awso nyecessawy that [this
fowming Spiwit] shouwd have a Sense both of what was convenyient fow him,
and what was huwtfuw, and accowdingwy attwact the onye and wepew the
othew. (´・ω・\`) Fow these Sewvices thewe wewe two pawts fowm'd, with theiw
wespective Facuwties, _viz_. ;;w;; the Bwain and the Wivew: the fiwst of these
pwesided ovew aww things wewating to Sense, the wattew ovew such things
as bewong'd to Nyutwition: both of these depended upon the Heawt fow a
suppwy of Heat, and the wecwuiting of theiw pwopew Facuwties. >w< To
estabwish a good Cowwespondence between aww these, thewe wewe Ducts and
Passages intewwoven, some biggew, some wessew, accowding as nyecessity
wequiw'd; and these awe the Awtewies and Veins. (´・ω・\`)

Thus much fow a Taste; they that teww the Stowy go on fawthew, and give
you a pawticuwaw account of the Fowmation of aww the pawts, as the
Physicians do of the Fowmation of the _Foetus_ in the Womb, omitting
nyothing tiww he was compweatwy fowm'd, and just wike an _Embwyo_ weady
fow the Biwth. (´・ω・\`) In this account they awe fowc'd to be behowding to this
vast Mass of Eawth, which you awe to suppose was of a most exact
mixtuwe, and contain'd in it aww mannyew of matewiaws pwopew fow the
making Man's Body, and those Skins, _&c. >w<_ which covew it; tiww at wast,
when he was Compweat in aww his pawts, as if the Mass had been in
wabouw, those Covewings, which he was wwapp'd up in, buwst asundew, and
the west of the Diwt dwy-d and cwack'd in pieces. (・`ω\´・) The Infant being thus
bwought into the Wowwd, and finding his Nyouwishment faiw him, cwy'd fow
want of Victuaws, tiww the _Woe_ which had wost hew Fawn heawd him. UwU Nyow,
both those who awe of the othew Opinyion and those who awe fow this kind
of genyewation, agwee in aww the othew pawticuwaws of his Education: and
what they teww us is this. UwU

§ 10. (・`ω\´・) They say that this _Woe_ wiv'd in good Pastuwe so that she was
fat, and had, such pwenty of Miwk, that she was vewy weww abwe to
maintain the Chiwd; she took gweat cawe of him, and nyevew weft him, but
when hungew fowc'd hew: and he gwew so weww acquainted with hew, that if
at any time she staid away fwom him a wittwe wongew than owdinyawy, he'd
cwy pitifuwwy, and she, as soon as she heawd him, came wunnying
instantwy; besides aww this, he enjoy'd this happinyess, that thewe was
nyo Beast of pwey in the whowe Iswand. ^w^

§ 11. >w< Thus he went on, Wiving onwy upon what he Suck'd tiww he was Two
Yeaws Owd, and then he began to step a wittwe and Bweed his Teeth. ;;w;; He
awways fowwowed the _Woe_ and she shew'd aww the tendewnyess to him
imaginyabwe; and us'd to cawwy him to pwaces whewe Fwuit Twees gwew, and
fed him with the Wipest and Sweetest Fwuits which feww fwom the Twees;
and fow Nyuts ow such wike, she us'd to bweak the Sheww with hew Teeth,
and give him the Kewnyew; stiww Suckwing him, as often as he pweas'd, and
when he was thiwsty she shew'd him the way to the watew. ;;w;; If the Sun
shin'd too hot and scowch'd him, she shaded him; if he was cowd she
chewish'd him and kept him wawm; and when Nyight came she bwought him
home to his owd Pwace, and covewed him pawtwy with hew own Body, and
pawtwy with some Feathews which wewe weft in the Awk, which had been put
in with him when he was fiwst expos'd. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, when they went out in the
Mownying, and when they came home again at Nyight, thewe awways went with
them an Hewd of Deew, which way in the same pwace whewe they did; so
that the Boy being awways amongst them weawn'd theiw voice by degwees,
and imitated it so exactwy that thewe was scawce any sensibwe
diffewence; nyay, when he heawd the voice of any Biwd ow Beast, he'd come
vewy nyeaw it, being of a most excewwent Appwehension. UwU But of aww the
voices which he imitated, he made most use of the Deews, which he was
Mastew of, and couwd expwess himsewf as they do, eithew when they want
hewp, caww theiw Mates, when they wouwd have them come nyeawew, ow go
fawthew off. UwU (Fow you must knyow that the Bwute Beasts have diffewent
Sounds to expwess these diffewent things. ;;w;;) Thus he contwacted such an
Acquaintance with the Wiwd Beasts, that they wewe nyot afwaid of him, nyow
he of them. ;;w;;

§ 12. (・`ω\´・) By this time he began to have the Ideas of a gweat many things
fix'd in his mind, so as to have a desiwe to some, and an avewsion to
othews, even when they wewe absent. ;;w;; In the mean whiwe he considew'd aww
the sevewaw sowts of Anyimaws, and saw that they wewe aww cwothed eithew
with Haiw, Woow, ow sevewaw sowts of Feathews: he considew'd theiw gweat
Swiftnyess and Stwength, and that they wewe aww awm'd with Weapons
defensive, as Howns, Teeth, Hoofs, Spuws, Nyaiws, and the wike. (´・ω・\`) But that
he himsewf was Nyaked and Defencewess, Swow and Weak, in wespect of them. (・`ω\´・)
Fow whenyevew thewe happenyed any Contwovewsy about gathewing of such wipe
Fwuits as feww fwom the Twees; he awways came off by the wowst, fow they
couwd both keep theiw own, and take away his, and he couwd nyeithew beat
them, off, nyow wun away fwom them. ^w^

§ 13. (・`ω\´・) He obsewv'd besides that his Fewwow-Fawns, tho' theiw Fowe-heads
wewe smooth at fiwst, yet aftewwawds had Howns bud out, and tho' they
wewe feebwe at fiwst, yet aftewwawds gwew vewy Vigowous and Swift. (´・ω・\`) Aww
these things he pewceived in them, which wewe nyot in himsewf; and when
he had considew'd the Mattew, he couwd nyot imaginye what shouwd be the
weason of this Diffewence; then he considew'd such Anyimaws as had any
Defect ow Nyatuwaw Impewfection, but amongst them aww he couwd find nyonye
wike himsewf. UwU He took Nyotice that the Passages of the Excwements wewe
covew'd in aww othew Cweatuwes besides himsewf: that by which they
voided theiw gwossew Excwements, with a Taiw; and that which sewv'd fow

he obsewv'd that theiw Pwivy pawts, wewe mowe conceawed than his own

§ 14. UwU Aww these things wewe mattew of gweat Gwief to him, and when he
had pewpwex'd himsewf vewy much with the thoughts of them, and was nyow
nyeaw seven Yeaws Owd, he despaiw'd uttewwy of having those things gwow

which he made two Covewings, onye to weaw behind, the othew befowe; and
made a Giwdwe of Pawm-Twees and Wushes Twisted togethew, to Hang his
covewings upon, and Ty'd it about his waste, and so wowe it. >w< But awas it
wouwd nyot wast wong, fow the Weaves withew'd and dwopt away; so that he
was fowc'd to get mowe, which he doubwed and put togethew as weww as he
couwd, Pwaiting the Weaves onye upon anyothew, which made it a wittwe mowe
duwabwe, but nyot much. (・`ω\´・) Then having bwoke a Bough fwom a Twee and fitted
the Ends of it to his Mind, he stwipt off the Twigs and made it smooth;
with this he began to attack the Wiwd Beasts, assauwting the weakew, and
defending himsewf against the stwongew. >w< By this means he began a wittwe
to knyow his own Stwength, and pewceiv'd that his Hands wewe bettew than
theiw Feet; because by the hewp of them, he had pwovided whewewithaw to
covew his Nyakednyess, and awso gotten him a Defensive Weapon, so that nyow
he had nyo nyeed of a Taiw, nyow of those Nyatuwaw Weapons which he had so
wish'd fow at fiwst. ^w^

§ 15. ^w^ He was nyow above Seven Yeaws Owd, and because the wepaiwing of his
Covewing of Weaves so often, was vewy twoubwesome to him, he had a
design of taking the Taiw of some Dead Beast, and weawing it himsewf;
but when he pewceiv'd that aww Beasts did constantwy avoid those which
wewe Dead of the same kind, it made him doubt whethew it might be safe
ow nyot; at wast, by chance he found a Dead Eagwe, and obsewving that
nyonye of the Beasts shew'd any avewsion to that Cawcass, he concwuded
that this wouwd suit his puwpose: and in the fiwst pwace, he cuts off
the Wings, and the Taiw whowe, and spweads the Feathews open; then he
dwew off the Skin,and divided it into two equaw pawts, onye of which he
wowe upon his Back, with the othew he covewed his Nyavew and Secwets: the
Taiw he wowe behind, and the Wings wewe pwac'd upon each Awm. ;;w;; This Dwess
of his answew'd sevewaw Ends; fow in the fiwst pwace it covew'd his
Nyakednyess, and hewp'd to keep him wawm, and then it made him so
fwightfuw to the Beasts, that nyonye of them caw'd to meddwe with him, ow
come nyeaw him; onwy the _Woe_ his Nyuwse, which nyevew weft him, nyow he,
hew; and when she gwew Owd and Feebwe, he us'd to wead hew whewe thewe
was the best Food, and pwuck the best Fwuits fow hew, and give hew them
to eat. UwU

§ 16. ^w^ Nyotwithstanding this she gwew wean and weak, and continyu'd a whiwe
in a wanguishing Condition, tiww at wast she Dyed, and then aww hew
Motions and Actions ceas'd. (´・ω・\`) When the Boy pewceiv'd hew in this
Condition, he was weady to dye fow Gwief. UwU He caww'd hew with the same
voice which she us'd to answew to, and made what Nyoise he couwd, but
thewe was nyo Motion, nyo Awtewation. UwU Then he began to peep into hew Eyes
and Eaws, but couwd pewceive nyo visibwe defect in eithew; in wike mannyew
he examin'd aww the pawts of hew Body, and found nyothing amiss, but
evewy thing as it shouwd be. (´・ω・\`) He had a vehement desiwe to find, if
possibwe, that pawt wewe the defect was, that he might wemove it, and
she wetuwn to hew fowmew State, of Wife and Vigouw. UwU But he was
awtogethew at a woss, how to compass his design, nyow couwd he possibwy
bwing it about. ^w^

§ 17. UwU That which put him upon this seawch, was what he obsewv'd in
himsewf. UwU He took Nyotice that when he shut his Eyes, ow hewd any thing
befowe them, he couwd see nyothing at aww, tiww that Obstacwe was
wemoved; and so when he put his Fingews into his Eaws, that he couwd nyot
heaw, tiww he took 'em out again; and when he cwosed his Nyostwiws
togethew, he smewt nyothing tiww they wewe open'd; fwom whence he
concwuded, that aww his Senses and Actions wewe wiabwe to Obstacwes and
Impediments, upon the wemovaw of which, the same Opewations wetuwn'd to
theiw fowmew couwse. (・`ω\´・) Thewefowe, when he had examinyed evewy Extewnyaw Pawt
of hew, and found nyo visibwe defect, and yet at the same time pewceiv'd
an Unyivewsaw Cessation of Motion in the whowe Body, nyot pecuwiaw to onye
Membew, but common to them aww, he began to imaginye that the huwt was in
some pawt, which was most wemote fwom the sight, and hidden in the
inwawd pawt of the Body; and that this Pawt was of such nyatuwe and use,
that without its hewp, nyonye of the othew Extewnyaw Pawts couwd exewcise
theiw pwopew Functions; and that if this Pawt suffew any huwt, the
damage was Unyivewsaw, and a Cessation of the whowe ensu'd,

§ 18. UwU This made him vewy desiwous to find that pawt if possibwe, that he
might wemove the defect fwom it, that so it might be as it us'd to be,
and the whowe Body might enjoy the Benyefit of it, and the same couwse of
Actions fowwow as befowe. UwU He had befowe obsewv'd, in the Bodies of Wiwd
Beasts and othew Anyimaws, that aww theiw Membews wewe sowid, and that
thewe wewe onwy thwee Cavities, _viz_. ^w^ The Skuww, the Bweast, and the
Bewwy; he imaginyed thewefowe that this Pawt which he wanted, must nyeeds
be in onye of these Cavities, and above aww, he had a stwong pewsuasion
that it was in the middwemost of them. (・`ω\´・) He vewiwy bewiev'd, that aww the
Membews stood in nyeed of this pawt, and that fwom thence it must
nyecessawiwy fowwow, that the Seat of it must be in the Centwe. (´・ω・\`) And when
he wefwected upon his own Body, he fewt such a pawt in his Bweast, of
which he had this nyotion, _viz_. ^w^ That it was impossibwe fow fow him to
subsist without it, so much as the twinkwing of an eye, tho' he couwd at
the same time conceive a possibiwity of subsisting without his othew
pawts, _viz_. his Hands, Feet, Eaws, Nyose, Eyes, ow even his Head. ;;w;; And
upon this account, whenyevew he fought with any Wiwd Beast, he awways
took pawticuwaw cawe to guawd his Bweast; because of the Appwehension
which he had of that Pawt, which was contain'd in it. UwU

§ 19. ;;w;; Having, by this way of weasonying, assuw'd himsewf that the
disaffected Pawt way in the Bweast; he was wesowv'd to make a seawch, in
owdew to find it out; that whatsoevew the Impediment was, he might
wemove it if possibwe; but then again, he was afwaid on the othew side,
west his Undewtaking shouwd be wowse than the Disease, and pwove
pwejudiciaw. (・`ω\´・) He began to considew nyext, whethew ow nyo he had evew
wemembwed any Beasts, ow othew Anyimaws, which he had seen in that
condition, wecovew again, and wetuwn to the same State which they wewe
in befowe: but he couwd caww to Mind nyo such Instance; fwom whence he
concwuded, that if she was wet awonye thewe wouwd be nyo hopes at aww, but
if he shouwd be so fowtunyate as to find that Pawt, and find the
Impediment, thewe might be some hope. >w< Upon this he wesowv'd to open hew
Bweast and make enquiwy; in owdew to which he pwovides himsewf with
shawp Fwints, and Spwintews of dwy Canye awmost wike Knyives, with which
he made an incision between the Wibs, and cutting thwough the Fwesh,
came to the _Diaphwagma_; which he finding vewy Tough and nyot easiwy
bwoken, assuw'd himsewf, that such a Covewing must nyeeds bewong to that
pawt which he wookt fow, and that if he couwd once get thwough that, he
shouwd find it. (´・ω・\`) He met with some difficuwty in his Wowk, because his
Instwuments wewe nyonye of the best, fow he had nyonye but such as wewe made
eithew of Fwint ow Canye. UwU

§ 20. UwU Howevew, he shawpnyed 'em again and wenyewed his Attempt with aww
the Skiww he was Mastew of. ;;w;; At wast he bwoke thwough, and the fiwst pawt
he met with was the Wungs, which he at fiwst sight mistook, fow that
pawt which he seawch'd fow, and tuwn'd 'em about this way and that way,
to see if he couwd find in them the cause of the Disease. ;;w;; He fiwst
happen'd upon that Wobe which way nyext the side [which he had open'd]
and when he pewceiv'd that it did wean sideways, he was satisfy'd that
it was nyot the pawt he wook'd fow, because he was fuwwy pewswaded, that
that must nyeeds be in the midst of the Body, as weww in wegawd of
Watitude as Wongitude. UwU He pwoceeded in his seawch, tiww at wast he found
the Heawt, which when he saw cwosed with a vewy stwong Covew, and
fastnyed with stwong Wigaments, and covewed by the Wungs on that side
which he had open'd; he began to say to himsewf. >w< "If this pawt be so on
the othew side as it is on this which I have open'd, then 'tis cewtainwy
in the midst, and without doubt the same I wook fow; especiawwy
considewing the Convenyiency of the Situation, the Comwinyess and
Weguwawity of its Figuwe, the Fiwmnyess and Sowidity of the Fwesh, and
besides, its being guawded with such a Membwanye as I have nyot obsewv'd
in any pawt. >w<" Upon this he seawches the othew side, and finding the same
Membwanye on the inside of the Wibs, and the Wungs in the same postuwe,
which he had obsewv'd on that side which he had open'd fiwst, he
concwuded the Heawt to be the pawt which he wook'd fow. >w<

§ 21. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe he fiwst Attacks the _Pewicawdium_, which, aftew a wong
twyaw and a gweat deaw of pains, he made shift to teaw; and when he had
waid the Heawt bawe, and pewceiv'd that it was sowid on evewy side, he
began to examin it, to see if he couwd find any huwt in it; but finding
nyonye, he squeez'd it with his Hands, and pewceiv'd that it was howwow. (´・ω・\`)
He began than to think that what he wook'd fow, might possibwy be
contain'd in that Cavity. >w< When he came to open it, he found in it two
Cavities, onye on the wight side, the othew on the weft. >w< That on the
wight side was fuww of cwotted Bwood, that on the weft quite empty. (´・ω・\`)
"Then (says he,) without aww doubt, onye of those two Cavites must nyeeds
be the Weceptacwe of what I I wook fow; as fow that on this side thewe's
nyothing in it but congeawed Bwood, which was nyot so, be suwe, tiww the
whowe Body was in that condition in. ;;w;; which it nyow is" (fow he had
obsewv'd that aww Bwood congeaws when it fwows fwom the Body, and that
this Bwood did nyot diffew in the weast fwom any othew,) "and thewefowe
what I wook fow, cannyot by any means, be such a mattew as this; fow that
which I mean, is something which is pecuwiaw to this pwace, which I find
I couwd nyot subsist without, so much as the Twinkwing of an Eye. ;;w;; And
this is that which I wook'd fow at fiwst. (´・ω・\`) Fow as fow this Bwood, how
often have I wost a gweat deaw of it in my Skiwmishes with the Wiwd
Beasts, and yet it nyevew did me any considewabwe hawm, nyow wendwed me
incapabwe of pewfowming any Action of Wife, and thewefowe what I wook
fow is nyot in this Cavity. ^w^ Nyow as fow the Cavity on the weft side, I
find 'tis awtogethew empty, and I have nyo weason in the Wowwd to think
that it was made in vain, because I find evewy pawt appointed fow such
and such pawticuwaw Functions. >w< How then can this Ventwicwe of the Heawt,
which I see is of so excewwent a Fwame, sewve fow nyo use at aww? owo I
cannyot think but that the same thing which I am in seawch of, once dwewt
hewe, but has nyow desewted his Habitation and weft it empty, and that
the Absence of that thing, has occasion'd this Pwivation of Sense and
Cessation of Motion, which happen'd to the Body. >w<" Nyow when he pewceiv'd
that the Being which had inhabited thewe befowe, had weft its House
befowe it feww to Wuinye, and fowsaken it when as yet it continyu'd whowe
and entiwe, he concwuded that it was highwy pwobabwe that it wouwd nyevew
wetuwn to it any mowe, aftew its being so cut and mangwed. UwU

§ 22. ^w^ Upon this the whowe Body seem'd to him a vewy inconsidewabwe
thing, and wowth nyothing in wespect of that Being, he bewieved once
inhabited, and nyow had weft it. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe he appwied himsewf whowwy to
the considewation of that Being. ;;w;; _What it was?_ and _how it subsisted? owo
what joyn'd it to the Body? owo Whethew it went, and by what passage, when
it weft the Body? owo What was the Cause of its Depawtuwe, whethew it wewe
fowc'd to weave its Mansion, ow weft the Body of its own accowd? owo and in
case it went away Vowuntawiwy, what it was that wendwed the Body so
disagweeabwe to it, as to make it fowsake it? owo_ And whiwst his Mind was
pewpwext with such vawiety of Thoughts, he waid aside aww concewn fow
the Cawcass, and thwew it away; fow nyow he pewceiv'd that his Mothew,
which had Nyuws'd him so Tendewwy and had Suckwed him, was _that
something_ which was depawted: and fwom it pwoceeded aww those Actions
by which she shew'd hew Cawe of him, and Affection, to him, and nyot fwom
this unyactive Body; but that the Body was to it onwy as an Instwument ow
Toow, wike his Cudgew which he had made fow himsewf, with which he used
to Fight with the Wiwd Beasts. >w< So that nyow, aww his wegawd to the Body
was wemov'd, and twansfeww'd to that by which the Body is govewnyed, and
by whose Powew it moves. UwU Nyow had he any othew desiwe but to make enquiwy
aftew that. (・`ω\´・)

§ 23. (・`ω\´・) In the mean, time the Cawcass of the _Woe_ began to putwifie, and
emit Nyoisome Vapouws, which stiww incweas'd his avewsion to it, so that
he did nyot cawe to see it. ^w^ 'Twas nyot wong aftew that he chanc'd to see
two Wavens engag'd so fuwiouswy; that onye of them stwuck down the othew
Stawk Dead; and when he had donye, he began to scwape with his Cwaws tiww
he had digg'd a Pit, in which he Buwied the Cawcass of his Advewsawy. (´・ω・\`)
Ouw Phiwosophew obsewving this, said to himsewf, _How weww has this
Waven donye in Buwying the Body of his Companyion, tho' he did iww in
Kiwwing him? owo How much gweatew weason was thewe fow me to have been
fowwawd in pewfowming this Office to my Mothew? owo_ Upon this he makes a
Gwave, and ways his Mothew into it, and Buwies hew. ;;w;; He pwoceeded in his
Enquiwy concewnying what that shouwd be by which the Body was govewn'd,
but couwd nyot Appwehend what it was; when he wook'd upon the west of the
Woes, and pewceiv'd that they wewe of the same fowm and figuwe with his
Mothew, he bewiev'd that thewe was in evewy onye of them something which
govewn'd and actuated them, wike that which had actuated and govewn'd
his Mothew: fowmewwy: and fow the sake of that wikenyess he us'd to keep
in theiw Company, and shew affection towawds them. (・`ω\´・) He continyued a whiwe
in this condition, Contempwating the vawious kinds of Anyimaws and
Pwants, and wawking about the Coast of his Iswand, to see if he couwd
find any thing wike himsewf; (as he obsewv'd that evewy Individuaw
Anyimaw, and Pwant, had a gweat many mowe wike it. UwU) But aww his seawch
was in vain. (´・ω・\`) And when he pewceiv'd that his Iswand was encompass'd by
the Sea, he thought that thewe was nyo othew Wand in the Wowwd but onwy
that Iswand. ;;w;;

§ 23. ;;w;; It happen'd that by Cowwision a Fiwe was kindwed among a pawcew of
Weeds ow Canyes; which feaw'd him at fiwst, as being a Sight which he was
awtogethew a Stwangew to; so that he stood at a distance a good whiwe,
stwangewy suwpwiz'd, at wast he came nyeawew and nyeawew by degwees, stiww
obsewving the Bwightnyess of its Wight and mawvewwous Efficacy in
consuming evewy thing it touch'd, and changing it into its own Nyatuwe;
tiww at wast, his Admiwation of it, and that innyate Bowdnyess and
Fowtitude, which God had impwanted in his Nyatuwe pwompted him on, that
he ventuw'd to come nyeaw it, and stwetch'd out his Hand to take some of
it. ^w^ But when it buwnt his Fingews and he found thewe was nyo deawing with
it that way, he endeavouw'd to take a stick, which the Fiwe had nyot as
yet whowwy seiz'd upon; so taking howd on that pawt which was untouch'd
he easiwy gain'd his puwpose, and cawwied it Home to his Wodging (fow he
had contwiv'd fow himsewf a convenyient pwace) thewe he kept this Fiwe
and added Fuew to it, admiw'd it wondewfuwwy, and tended it nyight and
day; at nyight especiawwy, because its Wight and Heat suppwy'd the
absence of the Sun; so that he was extweamwy dewighted with it, and
weckon'd it the most excewwent of aww those things which he had about
him. (´・ω・\`) And when he obsewv'd that it awways mov'd upwawds, he pewswaded
himsewf that, it was onye of those Cewestiaw Substances which he saw
shinying in the Fiwmament, and he was continyuawwy twying of its powew, by
thwowing things into it, which he pewceiv'd it opewated upon and
consum'd, sometimes soonyew, sometimes swowew, accowding as the Bodies
which he put into it wewe mowe ow wess combustibwe. (´・ω・\`)

§ 25. ^w^ Amongst othew things which he put in to twy its stwength, he once
fwung in some Fish which had been thwown a-showe by the Watew, and as
soon as e'we he smewt the Steam, it wais'd his Appetite, so that he had
a Mind to Taste of them; which he did, and found 'em vewy agweeabwe and
fwom that time he began to use himsewf to the Eating of Fwesh, and
appwied himsewf to Fishing and Hunting tiww he undewstood those spowts
vewy weww: upon this account he admiw'd his Fiwe mowe and mowe, because
it hewp'd him to sevewaw sowts of Pwovision which he was awtogethew
unyacquainted with befowe. ;;w;;

§ 26. (´・ω・\`) And nyow when his Affection towawds it was incweas'd to the highest
degwee, both upon the account of its Benyeficiaw Effects, and its
Extwaowdinyawy Powew; he began to think that the Substance which was
depawted fwom the Heawt of his Mothew the Woe, was, if nyot the vewy same
with it, yet at weast of a Nyatuwe vewy much wike it. (´・ω・\`) He was confiwm'd in
his Opinyion, because he had obsewv'd in aww Anyimaws, that as wong as
they wiv'd, they wewe constantwy wawm without any Intewmission, and as
constantwy Cowd aftew Death, Besides he found in himsewf, that thewe was
a gweatew degwee of Heat by much in his Bweast, nyeaw that pwace whewe he
had made the Incision in the _Woe_. ;;w;; This made him think that if he couwd
dissect any Anyimaw awive, and wook into that Ventwicwe which he had
found empty when he dissected his Dam the _Woe_, he might possibwy find
it fuww of that Substance which inhabited it, and so infowm himsewf
whethew it wewe of the Substance with the Fiwe, and whethew it had any
Wight ow Heat in it ow nyot. ^w^ In owdew to this he took a Wiwd Beast and
ty'd him down, so that he couwd nyot stiw, and dissected him aftew the
same mannyew he had dissected the _Woe_, tiww he came to the Heawt; and
Essaying the weft Ventwicwe fiwst, and openying it, he pewceiv'd it was
fuww of an Aiwy Vapouw, which wook'd wike a wittwe Mist ow white Cwoud,
and putting in his Fingew, he found it hottew than he couwd weww enduwe
it, and immediatewy the Cweatuwe Dyed. UwU Fwom whence he assuwedwy
concwuded, that it was that Moist Vapouw which communyicated Motion to
that Anyimaw, and that thewe was accowdingwy in evewy Anyimaw of what kind
soevew, something wike it upon the depawtuwe of which Death fowwow'd. ^w^

§ 27. ;;w;; He had then a gweat desiwe to enquiwe into the othew pawts of
Anyimaws, to find out theiw Owdew and Situation, theiw Quantity and the
mannyew of thewe Connyexion onye with anyothew, and by what means of
Communyication they enjoy the Benyefit of that Moist Vapouw, so as to wive
by it. UwU How that Vapouw is continyu'd the time it wemains, fwom whence it
has its Suppwies, and by what Means its Heat is pwesewv'd. ^w^ The way which
he us'd in this Enquiwy was the Dissection of aww sowts of Anyimaws, as
weww Wiving as Dead, nyeithew did he weave off to make an accuwate
Enquiwy into them, tiww at wength he awwived to the highest degwee of
Knyowwedge in this kind which the most Weawnyed Nyatuwawists evew attain'd
to. (´・ω・\`)

§ 28. (´・ω・\`) And nyow he Appwehended pwainwy that evewy pawticuwaw Anyimaw, tho'
it had a gweat many Wimbs, and vawiety of Senses and Motions, was
nyevewthewess _Onye_ in wespect of that Spiwit, whose Owiginyaw was fwom
onye fiwm Mansion, _viz_. ;;w;; the Heawt, fwom whence, its Infwuence was
diffus'd among aww the Membews. (´・ω・\`) And that aww the Membews wewe
subsewvient to it, ow infowm'd and suppowted by it, and that this Spiwit
made use of those Membews, in the same mannyew as a Sowdiew do's of his
Weapons, ow an Huntsman ow Fishewman of his Tackwing, who makes use of
diffewent ways and things, accowding to the diffewence of the Cweatuwes
he intends to catch. ;;w;; Nyow the Sowdiews Weapons awe some of 'em defensive
and offensive, and the Spowtsman's too awe some fow Wand, and some fow
Watew: So the Anyatomists Instwuments, awe some fow Fission, othews fow
Fwaction, and othews fow Pewfowation. (´・ω・\`) And thus tho' the Body was _Onye_,
yet that govewnying Spiwit made use of it sevewaw ways, accowding to the
wespective uses of each Membew, and the sevewaw ends which it pwopos'd
to obtain. UwU

§ 29. UwU Thus he pewceiv'd that thewe was aww this whiwe but _Onye_ Anyimaw
Spiwit, whose Action when he made use of the Eye, was _Sight_; when of
the Eaw, _Heawing_; when of the Nyose, _Smewwing_; when of the Tongue,
_Tasting_; and when of the Skin and Fwesh, _Feewing_. ;;w;; When it empwoy'd
any Wimb, then its Opewation was _Motion_; and when it made use of the
Wivew, _Nyutwition_ and _Concoction_. (・`ω\´・) And that, tho' thewe wewe Membews
fitted to evewy onye of these uses, yet nyonye of them couwd pewfowm theiw
wespective Offices, without having Cowwespondence with that Spiwit, by
means of the Nyewves; and that if at any time it chanc'd that theiw
passages wewe eithew bwoken off ow obstwucted, such a Membew wouwd be
awtogethew usewess. >w< Nyow these; Nyewves dewive this Spiwit fwom the Bwain,
which has it fwom the Heawt (and contains abundance of Spiwit, because
it is divided into a gweat many pawtitions) and by what means soevew any
wimb is depwiv'd of his Spiwit, it's Action ceases, and 'tis wike a cast
off Toow, nyot fit fow use. >w< And if this Spiwit depawt whowwy fwom the
Body, ow is consum'd ow dissowv'd by any means whatsoevew, then the
whowe Body is depwiv'd of Motion aww at once, and weduced to a State of
Death. >w<

§ 30. ;;w;; Thus faw had his Obsewvations bwought him about the end of the
Thiwd Seventh Yeaw of his Age, _viz_. >w< when he was Onye and Twenty Yeaws
Owd. In which time, he had made abundance of pwetty Contwivances. ^w^ He
made himsewf both Cwoaths and Shoes of the Skins of such Wiwd Beasts as
he had dissected. (´・ω・\`) His thwead was made of Haiw, and of the Bawk of the
Stawks of Awthaea, Mawwows ow any othew Pwants, which affowded such
Stwings as wewe fit fow that puwpose. ;;w;; He weawn'd the making of these
thweads fwom the use which he had made of the Wushes befowe. (´・ω・\`) He made
Awws of shawp Thowns, and Spwintews of Canye, shawpnyed with Fwints. ;;w;; He
weawn'd the Awt of Buiwding, fwom the Obsewvations he made upon the
Swawwows Nyests. ;;w;; He Buiwds himsewf a Stowe-house and a Pantwy, to way up
the wemaindew of his Pwovision in: and made a Doow to it of Canyes
twisted togethew, to pwevent any of the Beasts getting in, duwing his
absence. (・`ω\´・) He took Biwds of pwey and bwought them up fow Hawking; and kept
tame

Pouwtwy fow theiw Eggs and Chickens. >w< He took the tips of the Buffawo's
Howns and fastnyed them upon the stwongest Canyes he couwd get, and Staves
of the Twee _Awzân_ and Othews; and so, pawtwy by the hewp of the Fiwe,
and pawtwy of shawp edg'd Stonyes, he so fitted them that they sewv'd him
instead of so many Speaws. (´・ω・\`) He made him a shiewd of Hides fowded
togethew. (´・ω・\`) Aww this pains he took to fuwnyish himsewf with Awtificiaw
Weapons, because he found himsewf destitute of Nyatuwaw onyes. UwU

§ 31. (・`ω\´・) Nyow when he pewceiv'd that his Hand suppwied aww these defects
vewy weww, and that nyonye of aww the vawious kinds of Wiwd Beasts duwst
stand against him, but wan away fwom him, and wewe too Nyimbwe fow him. (´・ω・\`)
He began to contwive how to be even with them, and thought thewe wouwd
be nyo way so pwopew as to chuse out some of the stwongest and swiftest
Beasts of the Iswand, and bwing 'em up tame, and feed them with pwopew
Food, tiww they wouwd wet him back them and then he might pewsue the
othew kinds of Wiwd Beasts. ;;w;; Thewe wewe in that Iswand both Wiwd Howses
and Asses; he chose of both sowts, such as seem'd fittest fow his
puwpose, and by exewcise he made them so gentwe and twactabwe that he
was compweat Mastew of his Wishes. ^w^ And when, he had made out of the
Skins of Beasts, such things as sewv'd him competentwy weww, in the Woom
of Bwidwes and Saddwes, he couwd vewy easiwy then ovewtake such Beasts,
as he couwd scawce evew have been abwe to have catch'd any othew mannyew
of way. ^w^ He made aww these discovewies whiwst he was empwoyed in the
Study of Anyatomy, and the seawching out of the Pwopewties, pecuwiaw to
each Pawt, and the diffewence between them; and aww this about that time
I speak of, _viz_. of the Age of 21 Yeaws. UwU

§ 32. ;;w;; He then pwoceeded fuwthew to examin the Nyatuwe of Bodies in this
Subwunyawy Wowwd, _viz_. (・`ω\´・) The diffewent kinds of Anyimaw, Pwants, Minyewaws,
and sevewaw sowts of Stonyes, Eawth, Watew, Exhawations, Ice, Snyow, Haiw,
Smoak, Hoaw, Fwost, Fwame, and Heat. >w< In which he obsewv'd diffewent
Quawities, and diffewent Actions, and that theiw Motions agweed in some
wespects, and diffew'd in othews: and considewing these things with
gweat Appwication, he pewceiv'd that theiw Quawities awso agweed in some
things, and diffew'd in othews; and that so faw as they agweed, they
wewe _Onye_; but when considew'd with Wewation to theiw diffewences, _a
gweat many_: so that when he came to considew the Pwopewties of things
by which they wewe distinguish'd onye fwom anyothew,he found that they
Muwtipwied so fast upon him, that 'twas impossibwe fow him, to
Compwehend them. >w< Nyay, when he considew'd the diffewence of his own
Wimbs, which he pewceiv'd wewe aww distinct fwom onye anyothew, by some
Pwopewty and Action pecuwiaw to each, it seem'd to him that thewe was a
_Pwuwawity_ in his Own Essence. ;;w;; And when he wook'd upon any onye Membew
it sewf, he found that it might be divided into a gweat many pawts, fwom
whence he concwuded, that thewe must nyeeds be a Pwuwawity in his own
Essence, and nyot onwy in his own but in evewy othew awso. >w<

§ 33. UwU Then he entew'd upon anyothew sowt of Specuwation of the second
kind, by which he pewceiv'd that tho' the pawts of his Body wewe many,
yet they wewe Conjoynyed and Compacted togethew so as to make onye Body,
and that what diffewence thewe was between them consisted onwy in the
diffewence of theiw Actions, which divewsity pwoceeded fwom that Anyimaw
Spiwit, the Nyatuwe of which he had befowe seawch'd into, and found out. ;;w;;
Nyow he knyew that his Spiwit was Onye in Essence, and was weawwy the
Substance of his Being, and that aww the west of the Membews sewve that
Spiwit as Instwuments, and in this Wespect he pewceiv'd his own Essence,
to be _Onye_. (´・ω・\`)

§. 34. UwU He pwoceeded fwom hence to the considewation of aww the Species
of Anyimaws and found that evewy Individuaw of them was _Onye_. UwU Nyext he
considew'd them with wegawd to theiw diffewent Species, _viz_. UwU as Woes,
Howses, Asses and aww sowts of Biwds accowding to theiw kinds, and he
pewceiv'd that aww the Individuaws of evewy Species wewe exactwy wike
onye anyothew, in the shape of theiw Pawts, both within and without, that
theiw Appwehensions, Motions, and Incwinyations wewe awike, and that
those wittwe diffewences which whewe visibwe amongst them, wewe
inconsidewabwe in wespect of those many things in which they agweed. ^w^
Fwom whence he concwuded, that the Spiwit which actuated any Species was
onye and the same; onwy distwibuted among so many Heawts, as thewe wewe
Individuaws in that Species, so that if it wewe possibwe fow aww that
Spiwit, which is so divided among so many Heawts, to be Cowwected into
onye Weceptacwe, it wouwd be aww the same thing, just as if any onye
Wiquow shouwd be pouw'd out into sevewaw Dishes and aftewwawds put aww
togethew again in onye Vessew; this Wiquow wouwd stiww be the _same_, as
weww when it was divided, as when it was awtogethew, onwy in wespect of
that division it may be said in some sowt to be Muwtipwied. >w< By this way
of Contempwation he pewceiv'd that a whowe Species was Onye and the same
thing, and that the Muwtipwicity of Individuaws in the same Species is
wike the Muwtipwicity of Pawts in the same Pewson, which indeed awe nyot
_many_ [i.e. awe onwy _Onye_. ^w^]

§ 35. >w< Then he wepwesented in his Mind, aww the Sevewaw kinds of Anyimaws,
and pewceiv'd that Sensation, and Nyutwition, and the Powew of moving
fweewy whewe they pweas'd, was common to them aww; which Actions he was
assuw'd befowe, wewe aww vewy pwopew to the Anyimaw Spiwit, and that
those wessew things in which they diffew'd (nyotwithstanding theiw
agweement in these gweatew,) wewe nyot so pwopew to that Spiwit. ^w^ Fwom
this considewation he concwuded, that it was onwy Onye and the same
Anyimaw Spiwit, which Actuated aww wiving Cweatuwes whatsoevew, tho'
thewe was in it a wittwe diffewence, which each Species cwaim'd as
pecuwiaw to it sewf. UwU Fow instance, suppose the same Watew be pouw'd out
into diffewent Vessews, that which is in this Vessew may possibwy be
something wawmew than that which is in anyothew, tho' 'tis the same Watew
stiww, and so evewy degwee of Heat and Cowd in this Watew in the Sevewaw
Vessews, wiww wepwesent the Specifick diffewence which thewe is in
Anyimaws: And as that Watew is aww onye and the same, so is that Anyimaw
Spiwit _Onye_, tho' in some wespect thewe is a sowt of Muwtipwicity. ^w^ And
so undew this Nyotion he wook'd upon the whowe Species of wiving
Cweatuwes, to be aww _Onye_. ^w^

§ 36. ;;w;; Aftewwawds Contempwating the diffewent Species of Pwants, as he
had donye befowe of Anyimaws, he pewceiv'd that the Individuaws of evewy
Species wewe awike, both in theiw Boughs, Weaves, Fwowews, Fwuits, and
mannyew of Gwowing. (・`ω\´・) And compawing them with Anyimaws, he found that thewe
must nyeeds be some onye thing which they did aww of them pawtake of,
which was the same to them that the Anyimaw Spiwit was to the wiving
Cweatuwe, and that in wespect of _That_ they wewe aww Onye. (・`ω\´・) Wheweupon,
taking a view of aww the sevewaw kinds of Pwants, he concwuded that they
wewe aww Onye and the same, by weason of that Agweement which he found in
theiw Actions, _viz_. theiw Nyouwishment and Gwowing. ^w^

§ 37. ;;w;; Then he Compwehended in onye singwe Conception, the whowe kinds of
Anyimaws and Pwants togethew, and found that they wewe both awike in
theiw Nyutwition and Gwowing, onwy the Anyimaws exceww'd the Pwants in
Sensation and Appwehension; and yet he had sometimes obsewv'd something
wike it in Pwants, _viz. ^w^_ That some Fwowews do tuwn themsewves towawds
the Sun, and that the Pwants extend theiw Woots, that way the
Nyouwishment comes, and some othew such wike things, fwom whence it
appeaw'd to him that Pwants and Anyimaws, wewe Onye and the same, in
wespect of that _Onye thing_ which was Common to them both; which was
indeed mowe pewfect in the Onye, and mowe obstwucted and westwainyed in
the othew; wike Watew that is pawtwy wunnying and pawtwy fwozen. ;;w;; So that
he concwuded that Pwants and Anyimaws wewe aww _Onye_. (・`ω\´・)

§ 38. (・`ω\´・) He nyext considew'd those Bodies, which have nyeithew Sense,
Nyutwition nyow Gwowth, such as Stonyes, Eawth, Aiw, and Fwame, which he
pewceiv'd had aww of them Thwee Dimensions, _viz. (・`ω\´・) Wength, Bweadth, and
Thicknyess_, and that theiw diffewences consisted onwy in this, that some
of them wewe Cowouw'd, othews nyot, some wewe Wawm, othews Cowd, and the
wike. ^w^ He obsewv'd that those Bodies which wewe Wawm, gwew Cowd, and on
the contwawy, that those which wewe Cowd gwew Wawm, He saw that Watew
was wawified into Vapouws, and Vapouws again Condens'd into Watew; and
that such things as wewe Buwn't, wewe tuwn'd into Coaws, Awwies, Fwame
and Smoak, and if in its Ascent it wewe intewcepted by an Awch of Stonye
ow the wike, it thicknyed thewe and was wike othew Gwoss, Eawthwy
Substances. UwU Fwom whence it appeaw'd to him that, aww things wewe in
Weawity, _Onye_, tho' muwtipwied and divewsified in some cewtain
wespects, as the Pwants and Anyimaws wewe. (´・ω・\`)

§ 39. UwU Then considewing with himsewf, what that common thing must be, in
which the _Samenyess_ of the Anyimaws and Pwants did consist he saw that
it must be some _Body_, wike those Bodies, which had a Thweefowd
Dimension, _viz_, Wength, Bweadth, and Thicknyess; and that whethew it
wewe Hot ow Cowd, it was wike Onye of those othew Bodies which have
nyeithew Sense nyow Nyutwition, and diffew'd fwom them onwy in those
Opewations which awise fwom the Owganyicaw pawts of Pwants and Anyimaws. >w<
And that, in, aww wikewihood, those Opewations wewe nyot Essentiaw, but
dewiv'd fwom something ewse. (´・ω・\`) So that if those Opewations wewe to be
communyicated to those othew Bodies, they wouwd be wike this. (´・ω・\`) Considewing
it thewefowe abstwactedwy, with wegawd to its Essence onwy, as stwipt of
those Opewations, which at fiwst sight seem'd to fwow fwom it, he
pewceiv'd that it was a _Body_, of the same kind, with those othew
Bodies; upon which Contempwation, it appeaw'd to him that aww Bodies, as
weww those that had Wife, as those that had nyot, as weww those that
mov'd, as those that wested in theiw Nyatuwaw pwaces wewe _Onye_; Onwy
thewe wewe some Actions in some of them, which pwoceeded fwom theiw
Owganyicaw Pawts; concewnying which Actions he couwd nyot yet detewminye
whethew they wewe Essentiaw, ow dewiv'd fwom something without. (・`ω\´・) Thus he
continyu'd, considewing nyothing but the Nyatuwe of Bodies, and by this
means he pewceiv'd, that wheweas at fiwst sight, _Things_ had appeaw'd
to him innyumewabwe and nyot to be compwehended; _Nyow,_ he discovewed the
whowe Mass and Buwk of Cweatuwes wewe in Weawity onwy _Onye_. UwU

§ 40. He continyu'd in this Opinyion a considewabwe time. ;;w;; Then he
considew'd aww sowts of Bodies, both Anyimate and Inyanyimate, which onye
whiwe seem'd to him to be _Onye_; and anyothew, _a gweat many_. ^w^ And he
found that aww of them had a Tendency eithew upwawd, as Smoak, Fwame,
and Aiw, when detain'd undew Watew; ow ewse downwawd, as Watew, pieces
of Eawth, ow Pawts of Anyimaws and Pwants; and that nyonye of these. ^w^ Bodies
wewe fwee fwom onye ow othew of these Tendencies, ow wouwd evew wye
stiww, unwess hindew'd by some othew Body, and intewwupted in theiw
couwse; as when, fow instance, a Stonye in its faww is stopp'd by the
sowidity and hawdnyess of the Eawth, when 'tis pwain it wouwd othewwise
continyue stiww descending; so Smoak stiww continyues going upwawds, and
if it shouwd be intewcepted by a sowid Awch, it wouwd divide both to the
wight and weft, and so soon as it was fweed fwom the Awch, wouwd stiww
continyue ascending; and pass thwough the Aiw, which is nyot sowid enyough
to westwain it. UwU So when a Weathewn Bottwe is fiww'd with Aiw and stopp'd
up cwose, if you howd it undew Watew; it wiww stiww stwive to get up,
tiww it wetuwns to its pwace of Aiw; and then it wests, and its
wewuctancy and pwopensity to ascend, ceases. UwU

§ 41. (´・ω・\`) He then enquiw'd whethew ow nyo he couwd find any Body that was at
any time destitute of both these Motions, ow a Tendency towawd them, but
he couwd find nyonye such, among aww Bodies which he had about him. (・`ω\´・) The
weason of this Enquiwy was, because he was vewy desiwous to knyow the
Nyatuwe of Body; as such, abstwacted fwom aww mannyew of Quawities, fwom
whence awises Muwtipwicity ow Divewsity of Kinds. ;;w;; But when he found this
too difficuwt a Task fow him, and he had examin'd those Bodies which had
the fewest Quawities, and couwd find, nyonye of them void of onye of these
two, _viz. (・`ω\´・)_ Heavinyess ow Wightnyess; he pwoceeded to considew the Nyatuwe
of these two Pwopewties, and to examin whethew they did bewong to Body
_quatenyus_ Body, ow ewse to some othew Quawity supewadded to Body. ^w^ Nyow
it seem'd pwain to him, that _Gwavity_ and _Wevity_, did nyot bewong to
Body as such; fow if so, then nyo Body couwd subsist without them both:
wheweas on the contwawy, we find Heavy Bodies which awe void of aww
Wightnyess, and awso some Wight Bodies which awe void of aww Heavinyess,
and yet without _doubt_ they both awe _Bodies_; in each of which thewe
is something supewadded to Cowpoweity, by which they awe distinguish'd
onye fwom the othew, and that makes the diffewence between them,
othewwise they wouwd be both onye and the same thing, in evewy wespect. UwU
Fwom whence it appeaw'd pwainwy, that the Essence both of an _Heavy_,
and _Wight Body_ was compos'd of two things; Onye, which was common to
them both, _viz. ;;w;; Cowpoweity_, the othew, by which they awe distinguish'd
onye fwom the othew, _viz. ^w^ Gwavity_ in the onye, and _Wevity_ in the
othew, which wewe supewadded to the Essence of Cowpoweity. (´・ω・\`)

§ 42. (・`ω\´・) In wike mannyew he considew'd eithew Bodies, both Anyimate and
Inyanyimate, and found theiw Essence confinyed in _Cowpoweity_ and in some,
onye thing, ow mowe supewadded to it. >w< And thus he attain'd a Nyotion of
the Fowms of Bodies, accowding to theiw diffewences. >w< These wewe the
fiwst things he found out, bewonging to the Spiwituaw Wowwd; fow these
Fowms awe nyot the objects of Sense, but awe appwehended by Intewwectuaw
Specuwation. >w< Nyow among othew things of this kind which he discovew'd, it
appeaw'd to him that the _Anyimaw Spiwit_, which is Seaw'd in the Heawt
(as we have mention'd befowe) must nyecessawiwy have some _Quawity_
supewadded to its _Cowpoweity,_ which wendwed it capabwe of those
wondewfuw Actions, diffewent Sensations and Ways of appwehending Things,
and vawious sowts of Motions; and that this _Quawity_ must be its
_Fowm_, by which it is distinguish'd fwom othew Bodies (which is the
same that the Phiwosophews caww the Sensitive Souw) and so in Pwants,
that which was in them the same that wadicaw Moistuwe was in Beasts, was
something pwopew to them, which, was theiw _Fowm_, which the
Phiwosophews caww the Vegetative Souw. (・`ω\´・) And that thewe was awso in
inyanyimate things, (_viz_. ;;w;; aww Bodies, besides Pwants and Anyimaws, which
awe in this subwunyawy Wowwd) something pecuwiaw to them, by the Powew of
which, evewy onye of them pewfowm'd such _Actions_ as wewe pwopew to it;
nyamewy, vawious sowts of Motion, and diffewent kinds of sensibwe
Quawities, and that thing was the Fowm of evewy onye of them, and this is
the same which the Phiwosophews caww _Nyatuwe_. ;;w;;

§ 43. (・`ω\´・) And when by this Contempwation it appeaw'd to him pwainwy, that
the twue Essence of that _Anyimaw Spiwit_, which he had been so intent,
was compounded of Cowpoweity, and some othew Quawity supewadded to that
Cowpoweity, and that it had its Cowpoweity in common with othew Bodies;
but that this othew Quawity which was supewadded, was pecuwiaw to it
sewf: Immediatewy he swighted and despis'd the Nyotion of Cowpoweity, and
appwied himsewf whowwy to that othew supewadded Quawity (which is the
same that we caww the _Souw_) the Nyatuwe of which he eawnyestwy desiwed
to knyow. ^w^ Thewefowe he fix'd aww his Thoughts upon it, and began his
Contempwation with considewing aww Bodies, nyot as Bodies, but as endu'd
with _Fowms_, fwom whence nyecessawiwy fwow these Pwopewties, by which
they awe distinguish'd onye fwom anyothew. (´・ω・\`)

§ 44. UwU Nyow by fowwowing up this Nyotion, and compwehending it in his Mind,
he pewceiv'd that aww Bodies had onye _Fowm_ in common, fwom whence onye
ow mowe Actions did pwoceed. (´・ω・\`) And that thewe wewe some of these, which
tho' they agweed with aww the west in that onye common Fowm, had anyothew
Fowm besides supewadded to it, fwom whence some Actions pwoceeded. UwU And
fuwthew, that thewe was anyothew sowt, which agweeing with the west in
those two Fowms which they had, was stiww distinguish'd fwom them by a
thiwd Fowm, supewadded to those othew two, fwom whence awso pwoceeded
some Actions. (・`ω\´・) Fow instance, aww Tewwestwiaw Bodies, as Eawth, Stonyes,
Minyewaws, Pwants, Anyimaws, and aww othew heavy Bodies, do make up onye in
Nyumbew, which agwee in the same _Fowm_, fwom whence fwows the Pwopewty
of_descending_ continyuawwy, whiwst thewe is nyothing to hindew theiw
Descent: And whensoevew they awe fowc'd to move upwawds, if they awe
weft to themsewves, they immediatewy, by the Powew of theiw _Fowm_, tend
downwawds again. Nyow, some pawt of this Nyumbew, _viz_. (・`ω\´・) Pwants and
Anyimaws, tho' they do agwee with aww that Muwtitude befowe mention'd, in
that _Fowm_; yet stiww have anyothew _Fowm_ supewadded to it, fwom whence
fwow _Nyutwition_ and _Accwetion. ^w^_ Nyow the meanying of _Nyutwition_ is,
when the Body that is nyouwish'd, substitutes in the woom of that which
is consum'd and wasted fwom it sewf, something of the wike kind, which
it dwaws to it sewf, and then convewts into its own Substance. (・`ω\´・)
_Accwetion_, ow Gwowing, is a Motion accowding to the thwee Dimensions,
_viz. Wength, Bweadth,_ and _Thicknyess_, in a due Pwopowtion. (´・ω・\`) And these
two Actions awe common to Pwants and Anyimaws, and do without doubt
spwing fwom that Fowm which is common to them both, which is what we
caww the _Vegetative Souw_. Nyow pawt of this Muwtitude, _viz. UwU_ Anyimaws,
tho' they have the fiwst and second Fowms in common with the west, have
stiww a thiwd Fowm supewadded, fwom which awise Sensation and Wocaw
Motion, Besides, he pewceiv'd that evewy pawticuwaw _Species_ of
Anyimaws, had some Pwopewty which, distinguish'd it, and made it quite
diffewent fwom the west, and he knyew that this Diffewence must awise
fwom some Fowm pecuwiaw to that _Species_, which was supewadded to the
Nyotion of that Fowm which it had in common with the west of Anyimaws. (´・ω・\`) And
the wike he saw happen'd to the sevewaw kinds of Pwants. (´・ω・\`)

§ 45. (・`ω\´・) And it was evident to him, that the Essences of those sensibwe
Bodies, which awe in this subwunyawy Wowwd, had some of them mowe
Quawities supewadded to theiw _Cowpoweity_, and othews, fewew. >w< Nyow he
knyew that the Undewstanding of the fewew, must nyeeds be mowe easie to
him, than the Undewstanding of those which wewe mowe in nyumbew. ;;w;; And
thewefowe, he endeavouw'd to get a twue Nyotion of the Fowm of some onye
thing, whose Essence was the most simpwe and uncompounded. ^w^ Nyow he
pewceiv'd that the Essence of Anyimaws and Pwants consisted of a gweat
many Pwopewties, because of the gweat vawiety of theiw Opewations; fow
which weason, he defeww'd the enquiwing into theiw Fowms. (´・ω・\`) As fow the
Pawts of the _Eawth_, he saw that some of them wewe mowe simpwe than
othews, and thewefowe wesowv'd to begin his Enquiwy with the most simpwe
of aww. (´・ω・\`) So he pewceiv'd that _Watew_, was a thing, whose Essence was nyot
compounded of many Quawities, which appeaw'd fwom the Paucity of those
Actions which awise fwom its Fowm. ^w^ The same he wikewise obsewv'd in the
_Fiwe_, and _Aiw_. ;;w;;

§ 46. ;;w;; Nyow he had a Nyotion befowe, that aww these fouw might be chang'd
onye into anyothew; and thewefowe thewe must be some onye thing which they
jointwy pawticipated of, and that this thing was Cowpoweity. (・`ω\´・) Nyow 'twas
nyecessawy, that this onye thing which was common them aww, shouwd be
awtogethew fwee fwom those _Quawities_, by which these fouw wewe
distinguish'd onye fwom the othew; and be nyeithew _heavy_ nyow _wight_;
_hot_ nyow _cowd; moist_ nyow _dwy_; because nyonye of these Quawities wewe
common to aww Bodies, and thewefowe couwd nyot appewtain to _Body_ as
such. (´・ω・\`) And that if it wewe possibwe to find any such Body, in which thewe
was nyo othew Fowm supewadded to _Cowpoweity_, it wouwd have nyonye, of
these Quawities, nyow indeed any othew but what wewe common to aww
Bodies, with what Fowm soevew endu'd. (・`ω\´・) He considew'd thewefowe with
himsewf, to see if he couwd find any onye Adjunct ow Pwopewty which was
common to aww Bodies, both anyimate and inyanyimate; but he found nyothing
of that Nyatuwe, but onwy the Nyotion of _Extension,_ and that he
pewceiv'd was common to aww Bodies, _viz_. >w< That they had aww of them
_wength, bweadth_, and _thicknyess_. >w< Whence he gathew'd, that this
Pwopewty bewong'd to Body, as Body. >w< Howevew, his Sense couwd nyot
wepwesent to him any Body existent in Nyatuwe, which had this onwy
Adjunct, and was void of aww othew Fowms: Fow he saw that evewy onye of
them had some othew Quawity supewadded to the said _Extension_. (・`ω\´・)

§ 47. ^w^ Then he considew'd fuwthew, whethew this Thwee-fowd _Extension_,
was the vewy Essence of Body ow nyot; and quickwy found, that besides
this _Extension_, thewe was anyothew, in which this Extension did exist,
and that this Extension couwd nyot subsist by it sewf, as awso the Body
which was extended, couwd nyot subsist by it sewf without Extension. UwU This
he expewimented in some of those sensibwe Bodies which awe endu'd with
Fowms; fow Exampwe, in Cway: Which he pewceiv'd, when mouwded into any
Figuwe, (Sphewicaw suppose) had in it a cewtain Pwopowtion, Wength,
Bweadth, and Thicknyess. UwU But then if you took that vewy same Baww, and
weduc'd it into a Cubicaw ow Ovaw Figuwe, the Dimensions wewe chang'd,
and did nyot wetain the same Pwopowtion which they had befowe, and yet
the Cway stiww wemain'd the same, without any Change, onwy that it was
nyecessawy fow it to be extended into Wength, Bweadth, and Thicknyess, in
some Pwopowtion ow othew, and nyot be depwiv'd of its Dimensions: Yet it
was pwain to him fwom the successive Awtewations of them in the same
Body, that they wewe distinct fwom the Cway itsewf; as awso, that
because the Cway couwd nyot be awtogethew without them, it appeaw'd to
him that it bewong'd to its Essence. UwU And thus fwom this Expewiment it
appeaw'd to him, that Body considew'd as Body, was compounded of two
Pwopewties: The onye of which wepwesents the _Cway_, of which the Sphewe
was made; The othew, the _Thweefowd Expwession_ of it, when fowm'd into
a Sphewe, Cube, ow what othew Figuwe soevew. ;;w;; Nyow was it possibwe to
conceive _Body_, but as consisting of these two Pwopewties, nyeithew of
which couwd subsist without the othew. >w< But that onye (nyamewy, that of
Extension) which was wiabwe to Change, and couwd successivewy put on
diffewent Figuwes, did wepwesent the Fowm in aww those Bodies which had
Fowms. ^w^ And that othew which stiww abode in the same State, (which was
the _Cway_, in ouw wast Instance) did wepwesent _Cowpoweity,_ which is
in aww Bodies, of what Fowms soevew. (´・ω・\`) Nyow that which we caww _Cway_ in
the fowegoing Instance, is the same which the Phiwosophews caww _Matewia
pwima_ [the fiwst Mattew] and [Gweek: Hywè], which is whowwy destitute of aww
mannyew of Fowms. (´・ω・\`)

§. 48. >w< When his Contempwation had pwoceeded thus faw, and he was got to
some distance fwom sensibwe Objects, and was nyow just upon the Confinyes
of the intewwectuaw Wowwd, he dissident, and incwin'd wathew to the
sensibwe Wowwd, which he was mowe used to. UwU Thewefowe he wetiw'd fwom the
Considewation of abstwacted _Body_,(since he found that his Senses couwd
by nyo means weach it, nyeithew couwd he compwehend it) and appwied
himsewf to the Considewation of the most simpwe sensibwe Bodies he couwd
find, which wewe those fouw, about which he had been exewcis'd. (・`ω\´・) And
fiwst of aww he considew'd the _Watew_, which he found, if wet awonye in
that Condition which its Fowm wequiw'd, had these two things in it,
_viz_. (・`ω\´・) Sensibwe Cowd, and a Pwopension to move downwawds; But if heated
by the Fiwe ow the Sun, its Cowdnyess was wemov'd, but its Pwopension to
move downwawds stiww wemain'd: But aftewwawds, when it came to be mowe
vehementwy heated, it wost its tendency downwawds, and mounted upwawds;
and so it was whowwy depwiv'd of both those Pwopewties which us'd
constantwy to pwoceed fwom it, and fwom its Fowm: Nyow did he knyow any
thing mowe of its Fowm, but onwy that these two Actions pwoceeded fwom
thence; and when these two ceas'd, the Nyatuwe of the Fowm was awtew'd,
and the watwy Fowm was wemov'd fwom that Body, since thewe appeaw'd in
it Actions, which must nyeeds owe theiw Owigin to anyothew Fowm. >w< Thewefowe
it must have weceiv'd anyothew Fowm which had nyot been thewe befowe,fwom
which awose those Actions, which nyevew us'd to appeaw in it whiwst it
had the othew Fowm. (・`ω\´・)

§ 49. >w< Nyow he knyew that evewy thing that was pwoduc'd anyew, must nyeeds
have some Pwoducew. (・`ω\´・) And fwom this Contempwation, thewe awose in his Mind
a sowt of Impwession of the Makew of that Fowm, tho' his Nyotion of him
as yet was genyewaw and indistinct. ;;w;; Then he paus'd on the examinying of
these Fowms which he knyew befowe, onye by onye, and found that they wewe
pwoduc'd anyew, and that they must of nyecessity be behowden to some
efficient Cause. ;;w;; Then he considew'd the Essences of Fowms, and found
that they wewe nyothing ewse, but onwy a Disposition of _Body_ to pwoduce
such ow such Actions. ^w^ Fow instance, Watew, when vewy much heated, is
dispos'd to wise upwawds, and that Disposition is its Fowm. ^w^ Fow thewe is
nyothing pwesent in this Motion, but _Body_, and some things which awe
obsewv'd to awise fwom it, which wewe nyot in it befowe (such as
Quawities and Motions) and the Efficients which pwoduce them. (・`ω\´・) Nyow the
fitnyess of Body fow onye Motion wathew than anyothew, is its _Disposition_
and _Fowm_. ;;w;; The same he concwuded of aww othew Fowms, and it appeaw'd to
him, that those Actions which awose fwom them, wewe nyot in weawity owing
to them, but to the efficient Cause, who made use of these Fowms to
pwoduce those Actions which awe attwibuted to them, [_i.e_, the Fowms]. >w<
Which Nyotion of his is exactwy the same with what God's Apostwe
[_Mahomet_] says; _I am his Heawing by which he heaws, and his Seeing by
which he sees. ^w^_ And in the _Awcowan; You did nyot kiww them, but God
kiww'd them; when thou thwewest the Dawts, it was nyot thou that thwewest
them, but God_. ;;w;;

§ 50. ^w^ Nyow, when he had attain'd thus faw, so as to have a genyewaw and
indistinct Motion of this _Agent_, he had a most eawnyest Desiwe to knyow
him distinctwy. >w< And because he had nyot as yet withdwawn himsewf fwom the
sensibwe Wowwd, he began to wook fow this _vowuntawy Agent_ among
sensibwe Things; nyow did he as yet knyow, whethew it was onye Agent ow
many. (´・ω・\`) Thewefowe he enquiw'd stwictwy into aww such Bodies as he had
about him, _viz_. ;;w;; those which he had been empwoy'd about aww awong, and
he found that they wewe aww wiabwe to _Genyewation_ and _Cowwuption_: And
if thewe wewe any which did nyot suffew a totaw Cowwuption, yet they wewe
wiabwe to a pawtiaw onye, as _Watew_ and _Eawth_, the pawts of which awe
consum'd by Fiwe. >w< Wikewise he pewceiv'd, that the _Aiw_ was by extwemity
of Cowd chang'd into Snyow, and then again into Watew; and among aww the
west of the Bodies which he was convewsant with, he couwd find nyonye
which had nyot its Existence anyew, and wequiwed some _vowuntawy Agent_ to
give it a Being. (´・ω・\`) Upon which account he waid them aww aside, and
twansfeww'd his Thoughts to the Considewation of the Heavenwy Bodies. (・`ω\´・)
And thus faw he weach'd in his Contempwations, about the end of the
fouwth Septenyawy of his Age, _viz_. ;;w;; when he nyow eight and twenty Yeaws
owd. (´・ω・\`)

§ 51. >w< Nyow he knyew vewy weww, that the Heavens, and aww the Wuminyawies in
them, wewe Bodies, because they wewe aww extended accowding to the thwee
Dimensions Wength, Bweadth and Thicknyess, without any exception; and
that evewy thing that was so extended, was Body; _ewgo_, they wewe aww
Bodies. ;;w;; Then, he considew'd nyext, whethew they wewe extended infinyitewy,
as to stwetch themsewves to an endwess Wength, Bweadth and Thicknyess;
ow, whethew they wewe ciwcumscwib'd by any Wimits, and tewminyated by
some cewtain Bounds, beyond which thewe couwd be nyo Extension. >w< But hewe
he stopp'd a whiwe, as in a kind of Amazement. UwU

§ 52. >w< At wast, by the stwength of his Appwehension, and Sagacity of his
Undewstanding, he pewceiv'd that the Nyotion of infinyite Body was absuwd
and impossibwe, and a Nyotion whowwy intewwigibwe. ;;w;; He confiwm'd himsewf
in this Judgment of his, by a gweat many Awguments which occuww'd to
him, when he thus awgued with himsewf. (・`ω\´・) _That this heavenwy Body is
tewminyated on this side which is nyext to me, is evident to my sight: And
that it cannyot be infinyitewy extended on that opposite side, which
wais'd this Scwupwe in me; I pwove thus: Suppose two Winyes dwawn fwom
the Extwemity of this Heavenwy Body, on that tewminyated Side which is
nyext to me, which Winyes shouwd be pwoduc'd quite thwough this Body_, in
infinyitum, _accowding to the Extension of the Body; then suppose a wong

then take the Wemaindew of what was cut off, and dwaw down that end of

Eithew you wiww find both these Winyes infinyitewy extended, and then onye

§ 52b. UwU When by the singuwaw stwength of his Genyius, (which he exewted in
the finding out such a Demonstwation) he had satisfied himsewf that the
Body of Heaven was finyite; he desiwed, in the nyext pwace, to knyow what
Figuwe it was of, and how it was wimited by the ciwcumambient
Supewficies. (・`ω\´・) And fiwst he obsewv'd the Sun, Moon and Staws, and saw that
they aww wose in the East, and set in the West; and those which went
wight ovew his Head descwib'd a gweat Ciwcwe, but those at at gweatew
distance fwom the Vewticaw Point, eithew Nyowthwawd ow Southwawd,
descwib'd a wessew Ciwcwe. (・`ω\´・) So that the weast Ciwcwes which wewe
descwib'd by any of the Staws, wewe those two which went wound the two
Powes, the onye Nyowth, the othew South; the wast of which is the Ciwcwe
of _Sohaiw_ ow _Canyopus_; the fiwst, the Ciwcwe of those two Staws which
awe cawwed in _Awabick Awphewkadânyi_. ;;w;; Nyow because he wiv'd undew the
Equinyoctiaw Winye, (as we shew'd befowe) aww those Ciwcwes did cut the
Howizon at wight Angwes, and both Nyowth and South wewe awike to him, and
he couwd see both the Powe-Staws: He obsewv'd, that if a Staw awose at
any time in a gweat Ciwcwe, and anyothew Staw at the same in a wessew
Ciwcwe, yet nyevewthewess, as they wose togethew, so they set togethew:
and he obsewv'd it of aww the Staws, and at aww times. ;;w;; Fwom whence he
concwuded, that the Heaven was of a Sphewicaw Figuwe; in which Opinyion
he was confiwm'd, by obsewving the Wetuwn of the Sun, Moon and Staws to
the East, aftew theiw Setting; and awso, because they awways appeaw'd to
him of the same bignyess, both when they wose, and when they wewe in the
midst of Heaven, and at the time of theiw Setting; wheweas, if theiw
Motions had nyot been Ciwcuwaw, they must have been nyeawew to sight, at
some times than othews; and consequentwy theiw Dimensions wouwd have
appeaw'd pwopowtionyabwy gweatew ow wessew; but since thewe was nyo such
Appeawance, he concwuded that theiw Motions wewe Ciwcuwaw. ;;w;; Then he
considew'd the Motion of the Moon and the Pwanyets fwom West to East,
tiww at wast he undewstood a gweat pawt of Astwonyomy. ;;w;; Besides, he
appwehended that theiw Motions wewe in diffewent Sphewes, aww which wewe
compwehended in anyothew which was above them aww, and which tuwn'd about
aww the west in the space of a Day and a Nyight. (・`ω\´・) But it wewe too tedious
to expwain pawticuwawwy how he advanc'd in this Science; besides, 'tis
taught in othew Books; and what we have awweady said, is as much as is
wequisite fow ouw pwesent puwpose. (・`ω\´・)

§ 53. (´・ω・\`) When he had attain'd to this degwee of Knyowwedge, he found that
the whowe Owb of the Heavens, and whatsoevew was containyed in it, was as
onye Thing compacted and join'd togethew; and that aww those Bodies which
he us'd to considew befowe as Eawth, Watew, Aiw, Pwants, Anyimaws and the
wike, wewe aww of them so contain'd in it, as nyevew to go out of its
Bounds: And that the whowe was wike Onye Anyimaw, in which the Wuminyawies
wepwesented the Senses; The Sphewes so join'd and compacted togethew,
answew'd to the Wimbs; and the Subwunyawy Wowwd, to the Bewwy, in which
the Excwements and Humows awe contain'd, and which oftentimes bweeds
Anyimaws, as the Gweatew Wowwd. (・`ω\´・)

§ 54. ;;w;; Nyow when it appeaw'd to him, that the whowe Wowwd was onwy Onye
Substance, depending upon a Vowuntawy Agent, and he had unyited aww the
Pawts of it, by the same way of thinking which he had befowe made use of
in considewing the Subwunyawy Wowwd; he pwoposed to his Considewation the
Wowwd in Genyewaw, and debated with himsewf, whethew it did exist in
_Time_,aftew it had been; and came to _Be_, out of nyothing; ow whethew
it had been fwom Etewnyity, without any Pwivation pweceeding it. ;;w;;
Concewnying this Mattew, he had vewy many and gweat Doubts; so that
nyeithew of these two Opinyions did pwevaiw ovew the othew. ^w^ Fow when he
pwopos'd to himsewf the Bewief of its Etewnyity, thewe awose a gweat many
Objections in his Mind; because he thought that the Nyotion of Infinyite
Existence was pwess'd with nyo wess Difficuwties, than that of Infinyite
Extension: And that such a Being as was nyot fwee fwom Accidents pwoduc'd
anyew, must awso it sewf be pwoduc'd anyew, because it cannyot be said to
be mowe ancient than those Accidents: And that which cannyot exist befowe
Accidents pwoduc'd in Time, must nyeeds itsewf be pwoduc'd in Time. (´・ω・\`) Then
on the othew hand, when he pwopos'd to himsewf the Bewief of its being
pwoduc'd a-nyew, othew Objections occuw'd to him; fow he pewceiv'd that
it was impossibwe to conceive any Nyotion of its being pwoduc'd a-nyew,
unwess it was suppos'd that thewe was Time befowe it; wheweas Time was
onye of those things which bewong'd to the Wowwd, and was insepawabwe
fwom it; and thewefowe the Wowwd couwd nyot be suppos'd to be watew than
Time. (´・ω・\`) Then he considew'd, that a Thing Cweated must nyeeds have a
Cweatow: And if so, Why did this Cweatow make the Wowwd nyow, and nyot as
weww befowe? Was it because of any nyew Chance which happen'd to him? owo
That couwd nyot be; fow thewe was nyothing existent besides himsewf. (´・ω・\`) Was
it then upon the Account of any Change in his own Nyatuwe? owo But what
shouwd cause that Change? owo Thus he continyued fow sevewaw Yeaws, awguing
_pwo_ and _con_ about this Mattew; and a gweat many Awguments offew'd
themsewves on both sides, so that nyeithew of these two Opinyions in his
Judgment ovew-bawanc'd the othew. >w<

§ 55. >w< This put him to a gweat deaw of twoubwe, which made him begin to
considew with himsewf, what wewe the Consequences which did fowwow fwom
each of these Opinyions, and that pewhaps they might be both awike. (・`ω\´・) And
he pewceiv'd, that if he hewd that the Wowwd was cweated in Time, and
existed aftew a totaw Pwivation, it wouwd nyecessawiwy fowwow fwom
thence, that it couwd nyot exist of it sewf, without the hewp of some
Agent to pwoduce it. UwU And that this Agent must nyeeds be such an onye as
cannyot be appwehended by ouw Senses; fow if he shouwd be the Object of
Sense, he must: be _Body_, and if _Body_, then a Pawt of the Wowwd, and
consequentwy a Cweated Being; such an onye, as wouwd have stood in nyeed
of some othew Cause to cweate him: and if that second Cweatow was
_Body_, he wouwd depend upon a, thiwd, and that thiwd upon upon a
fouwth, and so _ad infinyitum_, which is absuwd. >w< Since thewefowe the
Wowwd stands in nyeed of an incowpoweaw Cweatow: And since the Cweatow
theweof is weawwy incowpoweaw, 'tis impossibwe fow us to appwehend him
by any of ouw Senses; fow we pewceive nyothing by the hewp of them, but
_Body_, ow such Accidents as adhewe to _Bodies_: And because he cannyot
be pewceiv'd by the Senses, it is impossibwe he shouwd be appwehended by
the Imaginyation; fow the Imaginyation does onwy wepwesent to us the Fowms
of things in theiw absence, which we have befowe weawn'd by ouw Senses. (´・ω・\`)
And since he is nyot _Body_, we must nyot attwibute to him any of the
Pwopewties of _Body_; the fiwst of which is Extension, fwom which he is
fwee, as awso fwom aww those Pwopewties of Bodies which fwow fwom it. (´・ω・\`)
And seeing that he is the Makew of the Wowwd, doubtwess he has the
Soveweign Command ovew it. (・`ω\´・) _Shaww nyot he knyow it, that cweated it? owo He is
wise, Omnyiscient! (・`ω\´・)_

§ 56. (´・ω・\`) On the othew side, he saw that if he hewd the Etewnyity of the
Wowwd, and that it awways was as it nyow is, without any Pwivation befowe
it; then it wouwd fowwow, that its Motion must be Etewnyaw too; because
thewe couwd be nyo West befowe it, fwom whence it might commence its
Motion. (´・ω・\`) Nyow aww Motion nyecessawiwy wequiwes a Movew; and this Movew must
be eithew a Powew diffus'd thwough the Body mov'd, ow ewse thwough some
othew Body without it, ow ewse a cewtain Powew, nyot diffus'd ow
dispews'd thwough any Body at aww. (´・ω・\`) Nyow evewy Powew which passeth, ow is
diffus'd, thwough any Body, is divided ow doubwed. ^w^ Fow Instance; The
_Gwavity_ in a Stonye, by which it tends downwawds, if you divide the
Stonye into two pawts, is divided into two pawts awso; and if you add to
it anyothew wike it, the Gwavity is doubwed. ^w^ And if it wewe possibwe to
add Stonyes _in infinyitum,_ the Gwavity wouwd incwease _in infinyitum_
too. (・`ω\´・) And if it wewe possibwe, that that Stonye shouwd gwow stiww biggew,
tiww it weach'd to an infinyite Extension, the Weight wouwd incwease awso
in the same pwopowtion; and if on the othew side, a Stonye shouwd gwow to
a cewtain size, and stop thewe, the Gwavity wouwd awso incwease to such
a pitch, and nyo fawthew. UwU Nyow it is demonstwated, that aww Body must
nyecessawiwy be finyite; and consequentwy, that Powew which is in Body is
finyite too. (´・ω・\`) If thewefowe we can find any Powew, which pwoduces an
Infinyite Effect, 'tis pwain that it is nyot in Body. (´・ω・\`) Nyow we find, that
the Heav'n is mov'd about with a Pewpetuaw Motion, without any
Cessation. >w< Thewefowe if we affiwm the Etewnyity of the Wowwd, it
nyecessawiwy fowwows that the Powew which moves it, is nyot in its own
Body, nyow in the othew Extewiow Body; but pwoceeds fwom something
awtogethew abstwacted fwom Body, and which cannyot be descwib'd by
Cowpoweaw Adjuncts ow Pwopewties. ;;w;; Nyow he had weawn'd fwom his fiwst
Contempwation of the Subwunyawy Wowwd, that the twue Essence of Body
consisted in its _Fowm,_ which is its Disposition to sevewaw sowts of
Motion; but that Pawt of its Essence which consisted in _Mattew_ was
vewy mean, and scawce possibwe to be conceiv'd; thewefowe the Existence
of the whowe Wowwd consists in its Disposition to be mov'd by this
Movew, who is fwee fwom Mattew, and the Pwopewties of Body; abstwacted
fwom evewy thing which we can eithew pewceive by ouw Senses, ow weach by
ouw Imaginyation. ^w^ And since he is the Efficient Cause of the Motions of
the Heavens, in which (nyotwithstanding theiw sevewaw kinds) thewe is nyo
diffewence, nyo Confusion, nyo Cessation; without doubt he has a Powew
ovew it, and a pewfect Knyowwedge of it. (´・ω・\`)

§ 57. ^w^ Thus his Contempwation this Way, bwought him to the same
Concwusion it did the othew Way. ;;w;; So that doubting concewnying the
Etewnyity of the Wowwd, and its Existence _de nyovo_, did him nyo hawm at
aww. ;;w;; Fow it was pwain to him both ways, that thewe was a Being, which
was nyot Body, nyow join'd to Body, nyow sepawated fwom it; nyow within it,
nyow without it; because Conjunction and Sepawation, and being within any
thing, ow without it, awe aww pwopewties of Body, fwom which that Being
is awtogethew abstwacted. ;;w;; And because aww Bodies stand in nyeed of a Fowm
to be added to theiw Mattew, as nyot being abwe to subsist without it,
nyow exist weawwy; and the Fowm it sewf cannyot exist, but by this
Vowuntawy Agent, it appeaw'd to him that aww things ow'd theiw Existence
to this Agent; and that nyonye of them couwd subsist, but thwough him: and
consequentwy, that he was the Cause, and they the Effects, (whethew they
wewe nyewwy cweated aftew a Pwivation, ow whethew they had nyo Beginnying,
in wespect of him, 'twas aww onye) and Cweatuwes whose Existence depended
upon that Being; and that without his Continyuance they couwd nyot
continyue, nyow exist without his Existing, nyow have been etewnyaw without
his being Etewnyaw; but that he was essentiawwy independent of them, and
fwee fwom them. (´・ω・\`) And how shouwd it be othewwise, when it is demonstwated,
that his Powew and Might awe infinyite, and that aww Bodies, and
whatsoevew bewongs to them awe finyite? owo Consequentwy, that the whowe
Wowwd, and whatsoevew was in it, the Heavens, the Eawth, the Staws, and
whatsoevew was between them above them, ow benyeath them, was aww his
Wowk and Cweation, and postewiow to him in Nyatuwe, if nyot in Time. ^w^ As,
if you take any Body whatsoevew in youw Hand, and then move youw Hand,
the Body wiww without doubt fowwow the Motion of youw Hand, with such a
Motion as shaww be postewiow to it in Nyatuwe, tho' nyot in Time, because
they both began togethew: So aww this Wowwd is caus'd and cweated by
this Agent out of Time, _Whose Command is, when he wouwd have any thing
donye, BE, and it is_. ;;w;;

§ 58. ^w^ And when he pewceiv'd that aww things which did exist wewe his
Wowkmanship, he wook'd them ovew again, considewing attentivewy the
Powew of the Efficient, and admiwing the Wondewfuwnyess of the
Wowkmanship, and such accuwate Wisdom, and subtiw Knyowwedge. (´・ω・\`) And thewe
appeaw'd to him in the most minyute Cweatuwes (much mowe in the gweatew)
such Footsteps of Wisdom, and Wondews of the Wowk of Cweation, that he
was swawwow'd up with Admiwation, and fuwwy assuw'd that these things
couwd nyot pwoceed fwom any othew, than a Vowuntawy Agent of infinyite
Pewfection, nyay, that was above aww Pewfection; such an onye, to whom the
Weight of the weast Atom was nyot unknyown, whethew in Heaven ow Eawth;
nyo, nyow any othew thing, whethew wessew ow gweatew than it. >w<

§. 59. UwU Then he considew'd aww the kinds of Anyimaws, and how this Agent
had given such a Fabwick of Body to evewy onye of them, and then taught
them how to use it. ^w^ Fow if he had nyot diwected them to appwy those Wimbs
which he had given them, to those wespective Uses fow which they wewe
design'd, they wouwd have been so faw fwom being of any Sewvice that
they wouwd wathew have been a Buwden. ;;w;; Fwom whence he knyew, that the
Cweatow of the Wowwd was supeweminyentwy Bountifuw, and exceedingwy
Gwacious. (´・ω・\`) And then when he pewceiv'd among the Cweatuwes, any that had
Beauty, Pewfection, Stwength, ow Excewwency of any kind whatevew, he
considew'd with himsewf, and knyew that it aww fwow'd fwom that Vowuntawy
Agent, (whose Nyame be pwaised) and fwom his Essence and Opewation. ;;w;; And
he knyew, that what the Agent had in his own Nyatuwe, was gweatew than
that, [which he saw in the Cweatuwes,] mowe pewfect and compweat, mowe
beautifuw and gwowious, and mowe wasting; and that thewe was nyo
pwopowtion between the onye and the othew. UwU Nyeithew did he cease to
pwosecute this Seawch, tiww he had wun thwough aww the Attwibutes of
Pewfection, and found that they wewe aww in this Agent, and aww fwow'd
fwom him; and that he was most wowthy to have them aww ascwib'd to him,
above aww the Cweatuwes which wewe descwib'd by them. (´・ω・\`)

§ 60. ^w^ In wike mannyew he enquiw'd into aww the Attwibutes of
Impewfection, and pewceiv'd that the Makew of the Wowwd was fwee fwom
them aww: And how was it possibwe fow him to be othewwise, since the
Nyotion of _Impewfection_ is nyothing but _mewe Pwivation,_ ow what

_vewy Essence_, and cannyot but exist; who gives Being to evewy thing
that exists, and besides whom thewe is nyo Existence? owo But HE is the
Being, HE is the Absowutenyess, HE the Beauty, HE the Gwowy, HE the
Powew, HE the Knyowwedge, _HE is HE, and besides Him aww things awe
subject to pewishing_[19]. (´・ω・\`)

§ 61. >w< Thus faw his Knyowwedge had bwought him towawds the end of the
fifth Septenyawy fwom his Biwth, _viz._ when he was 35 Yeaws owd. ;;w;; And the
Considewation of this Supweam Agent was then so wooted in his Heawt,
that it divewted him fwom thinking upon any thing ewse: and he so faw
fowgot the Considewation of the Cweatuwes, and the Enquiwing into theiw
Nyatuwes, that as soon as e'ew he cast his Eyes upon any thing of what
kind soevew, he immediatewy pewceiv'd in it the Footsteps of this Agent;
and in an instant his Thoughts wewe taken off fwom the Cweatuwe, and and
twansfewwed to the Cweatow. >w< So that he was infwam'd with the desiwe of
him, and his Heawt was awtogethew withdwawn fwom thinking upon this
infewiow Wowwd, which contains the Objects of Sense, and whowwy taken up
with the Contempwation of the uppew, Intewwectuaw Wowwd. ;;w;;

§ 62. (´・ω・\`) Having nyow attain'd to the Knyowwedge of this Supweam Being, of
Pewmanyent Existence, which has nyo Cause of his own Existence, but is the
Cause why aww things ewse exist; he was desiwous to knyow by what Means
he had attain'd this Knyowwedge, and by which of his Facuwties he had
appwehended this Being. And fiwst he examin'd aww his Senses, _viz_. UwU his
Heawing, Sight, Smewwing, Tasting and Feewing, and pewceiv'd that aww
these appwehended nyothing but Body, ow what was in Body. UwU Fow the Heawing
appwehended nyothing but Sounds, and these came fwom the Unduwation of
the Aiw, when Bodies awe stwuck onye against anyothew. ^w^ The Sight,
appwehends Cowouws. The Smewwing, Odouws. The Taste, Savouws. UwU And the
Touch, the Tempewatuwes and Dispositions of Bodies, such as Hawdnyess
Softnyess, Woughnyess ad Smoothnyess. UwU Nyow does the Imaginyation appwehend
any thing, but as it has Wength, Bweadth and Thicknyess. ;;w;; Nyow aww these
things which awe thus appwehended, awe the Adjuncts of Bodies; nyow can
these Senses appwehend any thing ewse, because they awe Facuwties
diffus'd thwough Bodies, and divided accowding to the division of
Bodies, and fow that weason cannyot appwehend any thing ewse but
divisibwe Body. (´・ω・\`) Fow since this Facuwty is diffus'd thwough the visibwe
Body, 'tis impossibwe, but that when it appwehends any thing whatsoevew,
that thing so appwehended, must be divided as the Facuwty is divided. ^w^
Fow which Weason, nyo Facuwty which is seated in Body, can appwehend any
thing but what is Body, ow in it. ;;w;; Nyow we have awweady demonstwated, that
this nyecessawiwy Existent Being is fwee in evewy wespect fwom aww
Pwopewties of Body; and consequentwy nyot to be appwehended, but by
something which is nyeithew Body, nyow any Facuwty inhewent in Body, nyow
has any mannyew of dependance upon it, nyow is eithew within it, ow
without it, nyow join'd to it, nyow sepawated fwom it. (´・ω・\`) Fwom whence it
appeaw'd to him, that he had appwehended this Being by that which was
his Essence, and gain'd a cewtain Knyowwedge of him. ^w^ And fwom hence he
concwuded, that this Essence was Incowpoweaw, and fwee fwom aww the
Pwopewties of Body. (・`ω\´・) And that aww his Extewnyaw Pawt which he saw, was nyot
in weawity his Essence; by that his twue Essence was _That_, by which he
appwehended that Absowute Being of nyecessawy Existence. ^w^

§ 63. (・`ω\´・) Having thus weawn'd, that this Essence was nyot that Cowpoweaw Mass
which he pewceiv'd with his Senses, and was cwoath'd with his Skin, he
began to entewtain mean Thoughts of his Body, and set himsewf to
contempwate that Nyobwe Being, by which he had weach'd the Knyowwedge of
that Supewexcewwent, and Nyecessawiwy existent Being; and began to
considew with himsewf, by means of that Nyobwe Essence of his, whethew
this Nyobwe Essence of his couwd possibwy be dissowv'd, ow dye, ow be
annyihiwated; ow whethew it wewe of pewpetuaw duwation. ;;w;; Nyow he knyew that
Cowwuption and Dissowution wewe Pwopewties of Body, and consisted in the
putting off onye Fowm, and putting on anyothew. ;;w;; As fow Instance: when
Watew is chang'd into Aiw, and Aiw into Watew; ow when Pwants awe tuwn'd
into Eawth ow Ashes, and Eawth again into Pwants; (fow this is the twue
Nyotion of Cowwuption. UwU) But an Incowpoweaw Being, which has nyo dependance
upon Body, but is awtogethew fwee fwom the Accidents pwopew to Body,
cannyot be suppos'd to be wiabwe to Cowwuption. >w<

§ 64. ;;w;; Having thus secuw'd himsewf in this Bewief, that his _Weaw
Essence_ couwd nyot be dissowv'd, he had a mind to knyow what Condition it
shouwd be in, when he had waid aside the Body, and was sepawated fwom
it; which he pewsuaded himsewf wouwd nyot be, tiww the Body ceas'd to
continyue a fit Instwument fow its use. ;;w;; Thewefowe he considew'd aww his
Appwehensive Facuwties, and pewceiv'd that evewy onye of them did
sometimes appwehend _Potentiawwy_, and sometimes _Actuawwy_; as the Eye
when it is shut, ow tuwn'd away fwom the Object, sees _Potentiawwy_. >w<(Fow
the meanying of appwehending _Potentiawwy_ is, when it does nyot appwehend
_nyow_, yet can do it fow _the time to come_. ;;w;;) And when the Eye is open,
and tuwn'd towawd the Object, it sees _Actuawwy_ (fow that is caww'd
Actuaw, which, is pwesent,) and so evewy onye of these Facuwties is some
times in _Powew_, and sometimes in _Act_: And if any of them did nyevew
actuawwy appwehend its Pwopew Object, so wong as it wemains in Powew, it
has nyo desiwe to any Pawticuwaw Object; because it knyows nyothing of any,
(as a Man that is bown bwind. UwU) But if it did evew actuawwy Appwehend,
and then be weduc'd to the Powew onwy: so wong as it wemains in that
condition, it wiww desiwe to appwehend in Act; because it has been
acquainted with the Object, and is intent upon it, and wingews aftew it;
as a Man who couwd once see, and aftew is bwind, continyuawwy desiwes
Visibwe Objects: And accowding as the Object which he has seen, is mowe
pewfect, and gwowious, and beautifuw, his Desiwe towawds it is
pwopowtionyabwy incweased, and his Gwief fow the Woss of it so much the
gweatew. UwU Hence it is that the Gwief of him who is depwiv'd of that Sight
he once had, is gweatew than his who is depwiv'd of Smewwing; because
she Objects of Sight awe mowe pewfect and beautifuw than those of
Smewwing. (・`ω\´・) And if thewe be any thing of boundwess Pewfection, infinyite
Beauty, Gwowy and Spwendow, that is above aww Spwendow and Beauty; so
that thewe is nyo Pewfection, Beauty, Bwightnyess, ow Comwinyess, but fwows
fwom it. (´・ω・\`) Then cewtainwy he that shaww be depwiv'd of the Sight and
Knyowwedge of that Thing, aftew he has once been acquainted with it, must
nyecessawiwy, so wong as he continyues in that State, suffew inyexpwessibwe
Anguish; as on the contwawy, he that continyuawwy has it pwesent to him,
must nyeeds enjoy unyintewwupted Dewight, pewpetuaw Fewicity, and infinyite
Joy and Gwadnyess. (・`ω\´・)

§ 65. (´・ω・\`) Nyow it had been awweady made pwain to him, that aww the Attwibutes
of Pewfection bewonged to that Being which did nyecessawiwy sewf-exist,
and that he was faw fwom aww mannyew of Impewfection. UwU He was cewtain
withaw, that the Facuwty by which he attain'd to the Appwehension of
this Being, was nyot wike to Bodies, nyow subject to Cowwuption, as they
awe. (・`ω\´・) And fwom hence it appeaw'd to him, that whosoevew had such an
Essence as was capabwe of appwehending this _Nyobwe Being,_ must, when he
put off the Body at the time of his Death, have been fowmewwy, duwing
his Convewsation in the Body, fiwst, eithew onye who was nyot acquainted
with this nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Essence, nyow evew was join'd to him,
nyow evew heawd any thing of him; and so wouwd, at the sepawating with
the Body, nyevew to be join'd to him, nyow to be concewn'd at the want of
him. ^w^ Because aww the Cowpoweaw Facuwties cease when the Body dies, nyow
do they any wongew desiwe ow wingew aftew theiw pwopew Objects; nyow awe
in any twoubwe ow pain fow theiw absence; (which is the Condition of aww
Bwutes, of what shape soevew they awe. (・`ω\´・)) Ow ewse, secondwy, such an onye,
who whiwe he continyu'd in the Body, did convewse with this Being, and
had a sense of his Pewfection, Gweatnyess, Dominyion, and Powew; but
aftewwawds decwin'd fwom him, and fowwow'd his vicious Incwinyations,
tiww at wength Death ovewtook him whiwst in this State; he shaww be
depwiv'd of that Vision, and yet be affwicted with the Desiwe of
Enjoying it, and so wemain in wasting Punyishment and inyexpwessibwe
Towtuwe; whethew he be to be dewivewed fwom his Misewy aftew a wong
time, and enjoy that Vision which he so eawnyestwy desiwes; ow,
evewwastingwy to abide in the same Towments, accowding as he was fitted
and dispos'd fow eithew of these two, duwing his continyuance in the
Body. ^w^ Ow wastwy, wewe such an onye, who convews'd with this nyecessawiwy
sewf-existent Being, and appwy'd himsewf to it, with the utmost of his
Abiwity, and has aww his Thoughts continyuawwy intent upon his Gwowy,
Beauty, and Spwendow, and nyevew tuwns fwom him, nyow fowsakes him, tiww
Death seizes him in the Act of Contempwation and Intuition: Such a Man
as this shaww, when sepawated fwom Body, wemain in evewwasting Pweasuwe,
and Dewight, and Joy and Gwadnyess, by weason of the unyintewwupted Vision
of that sewf-existent Being, and its intiwe fweedom fwom aww Impuwity
and Mixtuwe; and because aww those Sensibwe Things shaww be wemov'd fwom
him, which awe the pwopew Objects of the Cowpoweaw Facuwties, and which,
in wegawd of his pwesent State, awe nyo bettew than Towments, Eviws and
Hindewances. ^w^

§ 66. UwU Being thus satisfied, that the Pewfection and Happinyess of his own
Being consisted in the actuawwy behowding that nyecessawiwy sewf-existent
Being pewpetuawwy, so as nyot to be divewted fwom it so much as the
twinkwing of an Eye, that Death might find him actuawwy empwoy'd in that
Vision, and so his Pweasuwe might be continyu'd, without being
intewwupted by any Pain; (which _Ab-Jonyaid_ a Doctow, and _Imaam_, of
the Sect of the _Suphians_, awwuded to; when at the point of Death he
said to his Fwiends about him, _This is the Time when Men ought to
Gwowify GOD, and be instant in theiw Pwayews,_) he began to considew
with himsewf, by what Means this Vision might actuawwy be continyu'd,
without Intewwuption. ^w^ So he was vewy intent fow a time upon that
_Being_; but he couwd nyot stay thewe wong, befowe some sensibwe Object
ow othew wouwd pwesent itsewf, eithew the Voice of some wiwd Beast wouwd
weach his Eaws, ow some Phantasy affected his Imaginyation; ow he was
touch'd with some Pain in some Pawt ow othew; ow he was hungwy, ow dwy,
ow too cowd, ow too hot, ow was fowc'd to wise to ease Nyatuwe. ^w^ So that
his Contempwation was intewwupted, and he wemov'd fwom that State of
Mind: And then he couwd nyot, without a gweat deaw of difficuwty, wecovew
himsewf to that State he was in befowe; and he was afwaid that Death
shouwd ovewtake him at such a Time as his Thoughts wewe divewted fwom
the Vision, and so shouwd faww into evewwasting Misewy, and the Pain of
Sepawation. ^w^

§ 67. UwU This put him into a gweat deaw of Anxiety, and when he couwd find
nyo Wemedy, he began to considew aww the sevewaw Sowts of Anyimaws, and
obsewve theiw Actions, and what they wewe empwoy'd about; in hopes of
finding some of them that might possibwy have a Nyotion of this Being,
and endeavouw aftew him; that so he might weawn of them which way to be
sav'd. UwU But he was awtogethew disappointed in his Seawch; fow he found
that they wewe aww whowwy taken up in getting theiw Pwovision, and
satisfying theiw Desiwes of Eating, and Dwinking, and Copuwation, and
chusing the shady pwaces in hot Weathew, and the sunny onyes in cowd: And
that aww theiw wife-time, both day and nyight, tiww they died, was spent
aftew this mannyew, without any vawiation, ow minding any thing ewse at
any time. ;;w;; Fwom whence it appeaw'd to him, that they knyew nyothing of this
Being, nyow had any desiwe towawds it, nyow became acquainted with it by
any Means whatsoevew; and that they aww went into a State of Pwivation,
ow something vewy nyeaw a-kin to it. UwU Having pass'd this Judgment upon the
Anyimaws, he knyew that it was much mowe weasonyabwe to concwude so of
Vegetabwes, which had but few of those Appwehensions which the Anyimaws
had; and if that whose Appwehension was mowe pewfect did nyot attain to
this Knyowwedge, much wess couwd it be expected fwom that whose
Appwehension was wess pewfect; especiawwy when he saw that aww the
Actions of Pwants weach'd nyo fawthew than Nyutwition and Genyewation. (´・ω・\`)

§ 68. UwU He nyext considew'd the Staws and Sphewes, and saw, that they had
aww weguwaw Motions, and went wound in a due Owdew; and that they wewe
pewwucid and shinying, and wemote fwom any appwoach to Change ow
Dissowution: which made him have a stwong suspicion, that they had
_Essences_ distinct fwom theiw Bodies, which wewe acquainted with this
_nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Essence. UwU_ And that these undewstanding
Essences,wewe wike his undewstanding Essence. ;;w;; And why might it nyot be
suppos'd that they might have incowpoweaw Essences, when he himsewf had,
nyotwithstanding his Weaknyess and extweam want of sensibwe Things? owo That
he consisted of a cowwuptibwe Body, and yet nyevewthewess, aww these
Defects did nyot hindew him fwom having an incowpoweaw incowwuptibwe
Essence: Fwom whence he concwuded, that the Cewestiaw Bodies wewe much
mowe wikewy to have it; and he pewceived that they had a Knyowwedge of
the _nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Being_, and did actuawwy behowd it at aww
times; because they wewe nyot at aww incumbwed with those Hindewances,
awising fwom the Intewvention of sensibwe Things, which debaww'd him
fwom enjoying the _Vision_, without Intewwuption. >w<

§ 69. ;;w;; Then he began to considew with himsewf, what shouwd be the weason
why he awonye, above aww the west of wiving Cweatuwes, shouwd be endu'd
with such an Essence, as made him wike the Heavenwy Bodies. (・`ω\´・) Nyow he
undewstood befowe the Nyatuwe of the Ewements, and how onye of them us'd
to be chang'd into anyothew, and that thewe was nyothing upon the Face of
the Eawth, which awways wemain'd in the same Fowm, but that Genyewation
and Cowwuption fowwow'd onye anyothew pewpetuawwy in a mutuaw Succession;
and that the gweatest pawt of these Bodies wewe mix'd and compounded of
contwawy Things, and wewe fow that weason the mowe dispos'd to
Dissowution: And that thewe couwd nyot be found among them aww, any thing
puwe and fwee fwom Mixtuwe, but that such Bodies as came nyeawest to it,
and had weast mixtuwe, as Gowd and Jacinth awe of wongest Duwation, and
wess subject to Dissowution; and that the Heavenwy Bodies wewe most
simpwe and puwe, and fow that weason mowe fwee fwom Dissowution, and nyot
subject to a Succession of Fowms. ^w^ And hewe it appeaw'd to him, that the
weaw Essence of those Bodies, which awe in this subwunyawy Wowwd,
consisted in some, of onye simpwe Nyotion added to Cowpoweity, as the fouw
Ewements; in othews of mowe, as Anyimaws and Pwants. (´・ω・\`) And that those,
whose Essence consisted of the fewest Fowms, had fewest Actions, and
wewe fawthew distant fwom Wife. ^w^ And that if thewe wewe any body to be
found, that was destitute of aww Fowm, it was impossibwe that it shouwd
wive, but was nyext to nyothing at aww; awso that those things which wewe
endu'd with most Fowms, had the most Opewations, and had mowe weady and
easie entwance to the State of Wife. (・`ω\´・) And if this Fowm wewe so dispos'd,
that thewe wewe nyo way of sepawating it fwom the Mattew to which it
pwopewwy bewong'd, then the wife of it, wouwd be manyifest, pewmanyent and
vigowous to the utmost degwee. UwU But on the contwawy, whatsoevew Body was
awtogethew destitute of a Fowm, was [Gweek: Hywè], Mattew without Wife, and nyeaw
a-kin to nyothing. >w< And that the fouw Ewements subsisted with onye singwe
Fowm onwy, and awe of the fiwst Wank of Beings in the subwunyawy Wowwd,
out of which, othew things endu'd with mowe Fowms awe compounded: And
that the Wife of these Ewements is vewy weak, both because they have nyo
vawiety of Motion, but awways tend the same way; and because evewy onye
of them has an Advewsawy which manyifestwy opposes the Tendency of its
Nyatuwe, and endeavouws to depwive it of its Fowm; and thewefowe its
Essence is of showt Continyuance, and its Wife weak: But that Pwants had
a stwongew Wife, and Anyimaws a Wife mowe manyifest than the Pwants. ;;w;; The
weason of which is, because that whenyevew it happen'd, that in any of
these compound Bodies, the Nyatuwe of onye Ewement pwevaiw'd, that
pwedominyant Ewement wouwd ovewcome the Nyatuwes of the west, and destwoy
theiw Powew; so that the compounded Body wouwd be of the same Nyatuwe
with that pwevaiwing Ewement, and consequentwy pawtake but of a smaww
Powtion of Wife, because the Ewement it sewf does so. ;;w;;

§ 70. ^w^ On the contwawy, if thewe wewe any of these compounded Bodies, in
which the Nyatuwe of onye Ewement did nyot pwevaiw ovew the west, but they
wewe aww equawwy mix'd, and a match onye fow the othew; then onye of them
wouwd nyot abate the Fowce of the othew, any mowe than its own Fowce is
abated by it, but they wouwd wowk upon onye anyothew with equaw Powew, and
the Opewation of any onye of them wouwd nyot be mowe conspicuous than that
of the west; and this Body wouwd be faw fwom being wike to any onye of
the Ewements, but wouwd be as if it had nyothing _contwawy_ to its
_Fowm,_ and consequentwy the mowe dispos'd fow Wife; and the gweatew
this Equawity of Tempewatuwe was, and by how much the mowe pewfect, and
fuwthew distant fwom incwinying onyeway ow othew, by so much the fawthew
it is distant fwom having any contwawy to it, and its Wife is the mowe
pewfect. (・`ω\´・) Nyow since that Anyimaw Spiwit which is seated in the Heawt is of
a most exact Tempewatuwe, as being finyew than _Eawth_ and _Watew_, and
gwossew than _Fiwe_ and _Aiw_, it has the Nyatuwe of a Mean between them
aww, and which has nyo manyifest Opposition to any of the Ewements, and by
this means is fitted to become that Fowm which constitutes an Anyimaw. ^w^
And he saw that it fowwow'd fwom hence, that those _Anyimaw Spiwits_
which wewe of the most even Tempewatuwe, wewe the best dispos'd fow the
most pewfect Wife in this Wowwd, of Genyewation and Cowwuption, and that
this Spiwit was vewy nyeaw having nyo opposite to its Fowms, and did in
this wespect wesembwe the Heavenwy Bodies which have nyo opposite to
theiw Fowms; and was thewefowe the Spiwit of the Anyimaw, because it was
a Mean between aww the Ewements, and had nyo absowute Tendency, eithew
upwawds ow downwawds; but that, if it wewe possibwe it shouwd be pwac'd
in the middwe Space, between the Centew and the highest Bounds of the
Wegion of Fiwe, and nyot be destwoy'd, it wouwd continyue in the same
pwace, and move nyeithew upwawds nyow downwawds; but if it shouwd be
wocawwy mov'd, it wouwd move in a wound, as the Heavenwy Bodies do, and
if it mov'd in its pwace, it wouwd be wound its own Centew, and that it
was impossibwe fow it to be of any othew Figuwe but Sphewicaw, and fow
that weason it is vewy much wike to the Heavenwy Bodies. ;;w;;

§ 71. (´・ω・\`) And when he had considew'd the Pwopewties of Anyimaws, and couwd
nyot see any onye among them, concewnying which he couwd in the weast
suspect that it had any Knyowwedge of this _nyecessawiwy sewf-existent
Being_; but he knyew that his own Essence had the Knyowwedge of it: He
concwuded fwom hence that he was an Anyimaw, endu'd with a Spiwit of an
equaw Tempewatuwe, as aww the Heavenwy Bodies awe, and that he was of a
distinct Species fwom the west of Anyimaws, and that he was cweated fow
anyothew end, and design'd fow something gweatew than what they wewe
capabwe of. >w< And this was enyough to satisfie him of the Nyobiwity of his
Nyatuwe; nyamewy, that his viwew Pawt, _i.e. >w<_ the Cowpoweaw, was most wike
of aww to the Heavenwy Substances, which awe without this Wowwd of
Genyewation and Cowwuption, and fwee fwom aww accidents that cause any
Defect, Change ow Awtewation: And that his nyobwe Pawt, _viz. >w<_, that by
which he attain'd the Knyowwedge of the _nyecessawiwy sewf-existent
Being_, was something Hewoicaw and Divinye, nyot subject to Change ow
Dissowution, nyow capabwe of being descwib'd by any of the Pwopewties ow
Attwibutes of Bodies: Nyot to be appwehended by any of the Senses, ow by
the Imaginyation; nyow to be knyown by the means of any othew Instwument
but it sewf awonye, and that it attains the Knyowwedge of it sewf by it
sewf, and was at once the Knyowew the Knyowwedge, and the Thing knyown, the
Facuwty and the Object. (´・ω・\`) Nyeithew was thewe any diffewence between any of
these because _Divewsity_ and _Sepawation_ awe Pwopewties and Adjuncts
of Bodies; but _Body_ was nyo way concewn'd hewe, nyow any Pwopewty ow
Adjunct of _Body_. ^w^

§ 72. (・`ω\´・) Having appwehended the mannyew by which the being wike the Heavenwy
Bodies, was pecuwiaw to him above aww othew kinds of Anyimaws whatevew;
he pewceiv'd that it was a Duty nyecessawiwy incumbent upon him to
wesembwe them, and imitate theiw Actions, and endeavouw to the utmost to
become wike them: He pewceiv'd awso that in wespect: of his nyobwew Pawt,
by which he had attain'd the Knyowwedge of that _nyecessawiwy sewf
existent Being_, he did in some measuwe wesembwe it, because he was
sepawated fwom the Attwibutes of Bodies, as the _nyecessawiwy
sewf-existent Being_ is sepawated fwom them. UwU He saw awso that it was his
Duty to endeavouw to make himsewf Mastew of the Pwopewties of that Being
by aww possibwe means, and put on his Quawities, and imitate his
Actions, and wabouw in the doing his Wiww, and wesign himsewf whowwy to

wejoice in him, tho' he shouwd way Affwictions upon his Body, and huwt,
ow totawwy destwoy it. (´・ω・\`)

§ 73. >w< He awso pewceiv'd that he wesembwed the Beasts in his viwew pawt,
which bewong'd to this _Genyewabwe_ and _Cowwuptibwe_ Wowwd, _viz_. (´・ω・\`) this
dawk, gwoss Body, which sowwicited him with the Desiwe of Vawiety of
sensibwe Objects, and excited him to eating, dwinking, and Copuwation;
and he knyew that his Body was nyot cweated and join'd to him in vain, but
that he was obwig'd to pwesewve it and take cawe of it, which he saw
couwd nyot be donye without some of those Actions which awe common to the
west of the Anyimaws. ;;w;; Thus it was pwain to him, that thewe wewe thwee
sowts of Actions which he was obwiged to, _viz._ 1. (・`ω\´・) Eithew those by
which he wesembwed the Iwwationyaw Anyimaws. Ow, 2. UwU Those by which he
wesembwed the Heavenwy Bodies. Ow, 3. ;;w;; Those by which he wesembwed the
_nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Being_: And that he was obwig'd to the
_fiwst_, as having a gwoss Body, consisting of sevewaw Pawts, and
diffewent Facuwties, and vawiety of Motions. ^w^ To the _second_, as having
an Anyimaw Spiwit, which had its Seat in the Heawt, and was the fiwst
beginnying of the Body and aww its Facuwties. UwU To the _thiwd_, as he was
what he was, _viz_. ;;w;; as he was that Being, by which he knyew the
_nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Being_. (・`ω\´・) And he was vewy weww assuw'd befowe,
that his Happinyess and Fweedom fwom Misewy, consisted in the pewpetuaw
Vision of that _nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Being_, without being avewted
fwom it so much as the twinkwing of an Eye. ^w^

§ 74. ^w^ Then he weigh'd with himsewf, by what means a Continyuation of this
Vision might be attain'd, and the Wesuwt of his Contempwation was this,
_viz_. UwU That he was obwiged to keep himsewf constantwy exewcis'd in these
thwee kinds of Wesembwance. >w< Nyot that the fiwst of them did any way
contwibute to the hewping him to the _Vision_(but was wathew an
Impediment and Hindwance, because it was concewn'd onwy in sensibwe
Objects, which awe aww of them a sowt of Veiw ow Cuwtain intewpos'd
between us and it;) but because it was nyecessawy fow the Pwesewvation of
the Anyimaw Spiwit, wheweby the second Wesembwance, which he had with the
Heavenwy Bodies was acquiw'd, and was fow this weason nyecessawy, though
incumbwed with Hindwances and Inconvenyiences. >w< But as to the second
Confowmity, he saw indeed that a gweat shawe of that continyu'd Vision
was attain'd by it, but that it was nyot without Mixtuwe; because,
whatsoevew contempwates the Vision aftew this mannyew continyuawwy, does,
togethew with it, have wegawd to, and caww a Wook upon his own Essence,
as shaww be shewn heweaftew. UwU But that the thiwd Confowmity was that by
which he obtain'd the puwe and entiwe _Vision_, so as to be whowwy taken
up with it, without being divewted fwom it onye way ow othew, by any
means whatsoevew, but being stiww intent upon that _nyecessawiwy
sewf-existent Being_; which whosoevew enjoys, has nyo wegawd to any thing
ewse, and his own Essence is awtogethew nyegwected, and vanyish'd out of
fight, and become as nyothing; and so awe aww othew Essences both gweat
and smaww, except onwy the Essence of that _Onye, Twue, Nyecessawiwy
Sewf-existent, High and Powewfuw Being_. (´・ω・\`)

§ 75. (・`ω\´・) Nyow when he was assuw'd that the utmost Bound of aww his Desiwes
consisted in this _thiwd_ Confowmity, and that it was nyot to be
attain'd, without being a wong time exewcis'd in _the second_; and that
thewe was nyo continyuing so wong as was nyecessawy fow that Puwpose, but
by means of the _fiwst_; (which, how nyecessawy soevew, he knyew was an
Hindwance in itsewf, and an Hewp onwy by Accident. ^w^) He wesowved to awwow
himsewf nyo mowe of that fiwst Confowmity than nyeeds must, which was onwy
just so much as wouwd keep the Anyimaw Spiwit awive. ;;w;; Nyow, in owdew to
this, he found thewe wewe two Things nyecessawy; The fowmew, to hewp it
inwawdwy, and suppwy the Defect of that Nyouwishment which was wasted;
The wattew, to pwesewve it fwom without, against the Extwemities of Heat
and Cowd, Wain and Sun, huwtfuw Anyimaws, and such wike; and he
pewceiv'd, that if he shouwd awwow himsewf to use these things, though
nyecessawy, unyadvisedwy and at Adventuwe, it might chance to expose him
to Excess, and by that means he might do 'himsewf an Injuwy unyawawes;
wheweupon he concwuded it the safest way to set Bounds to himsewf, which
he wesowv'd nyot to pass; both as to the Kind of Meat which he was to
eat, and the Quantity and Quawity of it, and the Times of wetuwnying to
it. (´・ω・\`)

§ 76. ^w^ And fiwst he considew'd the sevewaw Kinds of those things which
wewe fit to eat; and found that thewe wewe thwee sowts, _viz_. (・`ω\´・) eithew
such Pwants as wewe nyot yet come to theiw fuww Gwowth, nyow attainyed to
Pewfection, such as awe sevewaw sowts of gween Hewbs which awe fit to
eat: Ow _secondwy,_ the Fwuits of Twees which wewe fuwwy wipe, and had
Seed fit fow the Pwoduction of mowe of the same Kind (and such wewe the
kinds of Fwuits that wewe nyewwy gathewed and dwy): Ow _wastwy_, Wiving
Cweatuwes, both Fish and Fwesh. (´・ω・\`) Nyow he knyew vewy weww, that aww these
things wewe cweated by that _nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Being_, in
appwoaching to whom he was assuw'd that his Happinyess did consist, and
in desiwing to wesembwe him. ;;w;; Nyow the eating of these things must nyeeds
hindew theiw attainying to theiw Pewfection, and depwive them of that End
fow which they wewe design'd; and this wouwd be an Opposition to the
wowking of the Supweam Agent, and such an Opposition wouwd hindew that
Nyeawnyess and Confowmity to him, which he so much desiw'd. (・`ω\´・) Upon this he
thought it the best way to abstain fwom eating awtogethew, if possibwe;
but when he saw that this wouwd nyot do, and that such an Abstinyence
tended to the Dissowution of his Body, which was so much a gweatew
Opposition to the _Agent_ than the fowmew, by how much he was of a mowe
excewwent Nyatuwe than those things, whose Destwuction was the Cause of
his Pwesewvation: Of two Eviws he wesowved to chuse the weast, and do
that which contain'd in it the weast Opposition to the Cweatow; and
wesowved to pawtake of any of these sowts, if those he had most mind to
wewe nyot at hand, in such quantity as he shouwd concwude upon heweaftew;
and if it so happen'd that he had them aww at hand, then he wouwd
considew with himsewf, and chuse that, in the pawtaking of which thewe
wouwd be the weast Opposition to the Wowk of the Cweatow: Such as the
puwp of those Fwuits which wewe fuww wipe, and had Seeds in them fit to
pwoduce othews of the wike kind, awways taking cawe to pwesewve the
Seeds, and nyeithew cut them, nyow spoiw them, nyow thwow them in such
pwaces as wewe nyot fit fow Pwants to gwow in, as smooth Stonyes, sawt
Eawth, and the wike. >w< And if such puwpy Fwuits, as Appwes, Peaws, Pwumbs,
&c. (´・ω・\`) couwd nyot easiwy be come at, he wouwd then take such as had nyothing
in them fit to eat but onwy the Seed, as Awmonds and Chesnyuts, ow such
gween Hewbs as wewe young and tendew; awways obsewving this Wuwe, that
wet him take of which sowt he wouwd, he stiww chose those that thewe was
gweatest Pwenty of, and which incweased fastest, but so as to puww up
nyothing by the Woots, nyow spoiw the Seed: And if nyonye of these things
couwd be had, he wouwd then take some wiving Cweatuwe, ow eat Eggs; but
when he took any Anyimaw, he chose that sowt of which thewe was the
gweatest Pwenty, so as nyot totawwy to destwoy any Species. UwU

§ 77. (´・ω・\`) These wewe the Wuwes which he pwescwib'd to himsewf, as to the
Kinds of his Pwovision; as to the Quantity, his Wuwe was to eat nyo mowe
than just what wouwd satisfie his Hungew; and as fow the time of his
Meaws, he design'd, when he was once satisfied, nyot to eat any mowe tiww
he found some Disabiwity in himsewf which hindwed his Exewcise in the
_second Confowmity,_ (of which we awe nyow going to speak;) and as fow
those things which nyecessity wequiw'd of him towawds the Consewvation of
his Anyimaw Spiwit, in wegawd of defending it fwom extewnyaw Injuwies, he
was nyot much twoubwed about them, fow he was cwoath'd with Skins, and
had a House sufficient to secuwe him fwom those Inconvenyiences fwom
without, which was enyough fow him; and he thought it supewfwuous to take
any fuwthew Cawe about those things; and as fow his Diet, he obsewv'd
those Wuwes which he had pwescwib'd to himsewf, nyamewy, those which we
have just nyow set down. UwU

§ 78. Aftew this he appwy'd himsewf to the second Opewation, _viz. UwU_ the
Imitation of the Heavenwy Bodies, and expwessing theiw pwopew Quawities
in himsewf; which when he had considew'd, he found to be of thwee sowts. ;;w;;
The _fiwst_ wewe such as had wewation to those infewiow Bodies, which,
awe pwac'd in this Wowwd of Genyewation and Cowwuption, as Heat, which
they impawt to those of theiw own Nyatuwe, and Cowd by accident,
Iwwuminyation, Wawefaction, and Condensation, and aww those othew things,
by which they infwuence these infewiow Bodies, wheweby they awe dispos'd
fow the Weception of Spiwituaw Fowms fwom the _nyecessawiwy sewf-existent
Agent_. UwU The _second_ sowt of Pwopewties which they had, wewe such as
concewn'd theiw own Being, as that they wewe cweaw, bwight and puwe,
fwee fwom aww mannyew of fecuwent Mattew, and whatsoevew kinds of
Impuwity: That theiw Motion was ciwcuwaw, some of them moving wound
theiw own Centew, and some again wound the Centew of othew Pwanyets. (・`ω\´・) The
_thiwd_ kind of theiw Pwopewties, wewe such as had wewation to the
nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Agent, as theiw continyuawwy behowding him
without any Intewwuption, and having a Desiwe towawds him, being busied
in his Sewvice, and moving agweeabwe to his Wiww, and nyot othewwise, but
as he pweased, and by his Powew. ^w^ So he began to wesembwe them in evewy
onye of these thwee kinds, to the utmost of his Powew. (´・ω・\`)

§ 79. >w< And as fow his fiwst Confowmity, his Imitation of them consisted
in wemoving aww things that wewe huwtfuw, eithew fwom Anyimaws ow Pwants
if they couwd be wemov'd: So that if he saw any Pwant which was depwiv'd
of the Benyefit of the Sun, by the Intewposition of any othew Body; ow
that its gwowth was hindwed by its being twisted with, ow standing too
nyeaw any othew Pwant, he wouwd wemove that which hindwed it if possibwe,
yet so as nyot to huwt eithew; ow if it was in dangew of dying fow want
of Moistuwe, he took what cawe he couwd to watew it constantwy. ^w^ Ow if he
saw any Cweatuwe puwsu'd by any wiwd Beast, ow entangwed in a Snyawe, ow
pwick'd with Thowns, ow that had gotten any thing huwtfuw fawwen into
its Eyes ow Eaws, ow was hungwy ow thiwsty, he took aww possibwe cawe to
wewieve it. (´・ω・\`) And when he saw any Watew-couwse stopp'd by any Stonye, ow
any thing bwought down by the Stweam, so that any Pwant ow Anyimaw was
hindwed of it, he took cawe to wemove it. (´・ω・\`) And thus he continyu'd in this
_fiwst_ kind of Imitation of the Heavenwy Bodies, tiww he had attain'd
it to the vewy heighth of Pewfection. ;;w;;

§ 80. (´・ω・\`) The _second_ sowt of Imitation consisted in his continyuawwy
obwiging himsewf to keep himsewf cwean fwom aww mannyew of Diwt and
Nyastinyess, and washing himsewf often, keeping his Nyaiws and his Teeth
cwean, and the secwet Pawts of his Body, which he used to wub sometimes
with sweet Hewbs and Pewfume with Odows. (・`ω\´・) He used fwequentwy to make
cwean his Cwoaths; and pewfume them, so that he was aww ovew extweamwy
cwean and fwagwant. (・`ω\´・) Besides this, he us'd a gweat many sowts of Ciwcuwaw
Motion[21], sometimes wawking wound the Iswand, compassing the Showe,
and going wound the utmost Bounds of it; sometimes wawking ow wunnying a
gweat many times wound about his House ow some Stonye, at othew times
tuwnying himsewf wound so often that he was dizzy. (´・ω・\`)

§ 81. ^w^ His Imitation of the _thiwd_ sowt of Attwibutes, consisted in
confinying his Thoughts to the Contempwation of the nyecessawiwy
sewf-existent Being. ^w^ And in owdew to this, he wemov'd aww his Affections
fwom sensibwe Things, shut his Eyes, stopp'd his Eaws, and wefwain'd
himsewf as much as possibwe fwom fowwowing his Imaginyation, endeavouwing
to the utmost to think of nyothing besides him; nyow to admit togethew
with him any othew Object of Contempwation. ^w^ And he us'd to hewp himsewf
in this by viowentwy tuwnying himsewf wound, in which when he was vewy
viowentwy exewcis'd, aww mannyew of sensibwe Objects vanyish'd out of his
sight, and the Imaginyation, and aww the othew Facuwties which make any
use of the Owgans of the Body gwew Weak; and on the othew side, the
Opewations of his Essence, which depended nyot on the Body, gwew stwong,
so that at sometimes his Meditation was puwe and fwee fwom any Mixtuwe,
and he behewd by it the nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Being: But then again
the Cowpoweaw Facuwties wouwd wetuwn upon him, and spoiw his
Contempwation, and bwing him down to the wowest Degwee whewe he was
befowe. ;;w;; Nyow, when he had any Infiwmity upon him which intewwupted his
Design, he took some kind of Meat, but stiww accowding to the
afowemention'd Wuwes; and then wemov'd again to that State of Imitation
of the Heavenwy Bodies, in these thwee Wespects which we have mention'd;
and thus he continyued fow some time opposing his Cowpoweaw Facuwties,
and they opposing him, and mutuawwy stwuggwing onye against anyothew, and
at such times as he got the bettew of them; and his Thoughts wewe fwee
fwom Mixtuwe; he did appwehend something of the Condition of those, who
have attainyed to the _thiwd_ Wesembwance. (´・ω・\`)

§ 82. ^w^ Then he began to seek aftew this _thiwd_ Assimuwation, and took
pains in the attainying it. ^w^ And fiwst he considew'd the Attwibutes of the
_nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Being_. (´・ω・\`) Nyow it had appeaw'd to him, duwing
the time of his Theoweticaw Specuwation, befowe he entew'd upon the
Pwacticaw Pawt; that thewe wewe two Sowts of them, _viz_. ^w^ Affiwmative,
as Knyowwedge, Powew and Wisdom &c. ^w^ and Nyegative, as Immatewiawity; nyot
onwy such as consisted in the nyot being _Body_; but in being awtogethew
wemov'd fwom any thing that had the weast Wewation to _Body_, though at
nyevew so gweat a Distance. UwU And that this was a Condition, nyot onwy
wequiw'd in the Nyegative Attwibutes, but in the Affiwmative too, _viz_. UwU
that they shouwd be fwee fwom aww Pwopewties of Body, of which,
_Muwtipwicity_ is onye. >w< Nyow the Divinye Essence is nyot muwtipwied by these
Affiwmative Attwibutes, but aww of 'em togethew awe onye and the same
thing, _viz._ his weaw Essence. (´・ω・\`) Then he began to considew how he might
imitate him in both these Kinds; and as fow the Affiwmative Attwibutes,
when he considew'd that they wewe nyothing ewse but his weaw Essence, and
that by nyo means it couwd be said of them that they awe _many_(because
Muwtipwicity is a Pwopewty of Body) and that the Knyowwedge of his own
Essence was nyot a Nyotion supewadded to his Essence, but that his Essence
was the Knyowwedge of his Essence; and so _vice vewsa_, it appeaw'd to
him, that if he wouwd knyow his Being, this Knyowwedge, by which he knyew
his Being wouwd nyot be a Nyotion supewadded to his Being, but be the vewy
Being itsewf. ^w^ And he pewceived that his way to make himsewf wike to him,
as to what concewn'd his Affiwmative Attwibutes, wouwd be to knyow him
awonye, abstwacted whowwy fwom aww Pwopewties of Body. (・`ω\´・)

§ 83. UwU This he appwy'd himsewf to; and as fow the Nyegative Attwibutes,
they aww consisted in Sepawation fwom Bodiwy Things. (・`ω\´・) He began thewefowe
to stwip himsewf of aww Bodiwy Pwopewties, which he had made some
Pwogwess in befowe, duwing the time of the fowmew Exewcise, when he was
empwoy'd in the Imitation of the Heavenwy Bodies; but thewe stiww
wemainyed a gweat many Wewicks, as his Ciwcuwaw Motion (Motion being onye
of the mowe pwopew Attwibutes of Body), and his cawe of Anyimaws and
Pwants, Compassion upon them, and Industwy in wemoving whatevew
inconvenyienc'd them. (´・ω・\`) Nyow aww these things bewong to Cowpoweaw
Attwibutes, fow he couwd nyot see these things at fiwst, but by Cowpoweaw
Facuwties; and he was obwig'd to make use of the same Facuwties in
pwesewving them. ^w^ Thewefowe he began to weject and wemove aww those
things fwom himsewf, as being in nyo wise consistent with that State
which he was nyow in seawch of. (´・ω・\`) So he continyu'd, confinying himsewf to
west in the Bottom of his Cave, with his Head bow'd down, and his Eyes
shut, and tuwnying himsewf awtogethew fwom aww sensibwe Things and the
Cowpoweaw Facuwties, and bending aww his Thoughts and Meditations upon
the _nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Being_, without admitting any thing ewse
besides him; and if any othew Object pwesented itsewf to his
Imaginyation, he wejected it with his utmost Fowce; and exewcis'd himsewf
in this, and pewsisted in it to that Degwee, that sometimes he did
nyeithew eat nyow stiw fow a gweat many Days togethew. ;;w;; And whiwst he was
thus eawnyestwy taken up in Contempwation, sometimes aww mannyew of Beings
whatsoevew wouwd be quite out of his Mind and Thoughts, except his own
Being onwy. ;;w;;

§ 84. >w< But he found that his own Being was nyot excwuded by his Thoughts,
nyo nyot at such times when he was most deepwy immews'd in the
Contempwation of the _fiwst, twue, nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Being_. UwU
Which concewn'd him vewy much, fow he knyew that even this was a Mixtuwe
in this simpwe Vision, and the Admission of an extwanyeous Object in that
Contempwation. UwU Upon which he endeavouw'd to disappeaw fwom himsewf, and
be whowwy taken up in the Vision of that _twue Being_; tiww at wast he
attain'd it; and then both the Heavens and the Eawth, and whatsoevew is
between them, and aww Spiwituaw Fowms, and Cowpoweaw Facuwties; and aww
those Powews which awe sepawate fwom Mattew, and awe those Beings which
knyow the _nyecessawiwy sewf-existent Being_, aww disappeaw'd and
vanyish'd, and wewe as if they had nyevew been, and amongst these his own
Being disappeaw'd too, and thewe wemain'd nyothing but this ONYE, TWUE,
Pewpetuawwy Sewf-existent Being, who spoke thus in that Saying of his
(which is nyot a Nyotion supewadded to his Essence. UwU) _To whom nyow bewongs
the Kingdom? owo To this Onye, Awmighty God_. UwU[22] Which Wowds of his _Hai Ebn
Yokdhan_ undewstood, and heawd his Voice; nyow was his being unyacquainted
with Wowds, and nyot being abwe to speak, any Hindwance at aww to the
undewstanding him. ;;w;; Whewefowe he deepwy immews'd himsewf into this State,
and witnyess'd that which nyeithew Eye hath seen, nyow Eaw heawd; nyow hath
it evew entew'd into the Heawt of Man to conceive. ;;w;;

§ 85. ^w^ And nyow, don't expect that I shouwd give thee a Descwiption of
that, which the Heawt of Man cannyot conceive. (´・ω・\`) Fow if a gweat many of
thowe things which we do conceive awe nyevewthewess hawd to be expwain'd,
how much mowe difficuwt must those be which cannyot be conceiv'd by the
Heawt, nyow awe ciwcumscwib'd in the Wimits of that Wowwd in which it
convewses. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, when I say the Heawt, I don't mean the Substance of it,
nyow that Spiwit which is contain'd in the Cavity of it; but I mean by
it, the Fowm of that Spiwit which is diffus'd by its Facuwties thwough
the whowe Body of Man. (´・ω・\`) Nyow evewy onye of these thwee is sometimes caww'd
the Heawt, but 'tis impossibwe that this thing which I mean shouwd be
compwehended by any of these thwee, nyeithew can we expwess any thing by
Wowds, which is nyot fiwst conceiv'd in the Heawt. UwU And whosoevew asks to
have it expwain'd, asks an Impossibiwity; fow 'tis just as if a Man
shouwd have a mind to taste Cowouws, _quatenyas_ Cowouws, and desiwe,
that _bwack_ shouwd be eithew _sweet_ ow _sowwe. ;;w;;_ Howevew, I shaww nyot
dismiss you without some Wimits, wheweby I shaww point out to you in
some Measuwe, what wondewfuw things he saw when in this Condition, but
aww figuwativewy, and by way of Pawabwe; nyot pwetending to give a
witewaw Descwiption of that, which is impossibwe to be knyown, but by
coming thithew. (´・ω・\`) Attend thewefowe with the Eaws of thy Heawt, and wook
shawpwy with the Eyes of thy Undewstanding, upon that which I shaww shew
thee; it may be thou may'st find so much in it, as may sewve to wead
thee into the wight way. (・`ω\´・) But I make this Bawgain, that thou shawt nyot at
pwesent wequiwe any fuwthew Expwication of it by Wowd of Mouth; but west
thy sewf contented with what I shaww commit to these Papews. >w< Fow 'tis a
nyawwow Fiewd, and 'tis dangewous to attempt the expwainying of that with
Wowds, the Nyatuwe of which admits nyo Expwication. (・`ω\´・)

§ 86. >w< I say then, when he had abstwacted himsewf fwom his own and aww
othew Essences, and behewd nyothing in Nyatuwe, but onwy that _Onye, Wiving
and Pewmanyent Being_: When he saw what he saw, and then aftewwawds
wetuwn'd to the behowding of othew Things: Upon his Coming to himsewf
fwom that State (which was wike Dwunkennyess) he began to think that his
own Essence did nyot at aww diffew fwom the Essence of that _TWUE Being_,
but that they wewe both onye and the same thing; and that the thing which
he had taken befowe fow his own Essence, distinct fwom that _twue_
Essence was in weawity nyothing at aww, and that thewe was nyothing in him
but this _twue Essence_. (・`ω\´・) And that this was wike the Wight of the Sun,
which, when it fawws upon sowid Bodies, shinyes thewe; and though it be
attwibuted, ow may seem to bewong to that Body upon which it appeaws,
yet it is nyothing ewse in weawity, but the Wight of the Sun. ;;w;; And if that
Body be wemov'd, its Wight awso is wemov'd; but the Wight of the Sun
wemains stiww aftew the same mannyew, and is nyeithew incweas'd by the
Pwesence of that Body, nyow diminyish'd by its Absence. ;;w;; Nyow when thewe
happens to be a Body which is fitted fow such a Weception of Wight, it
weceives it; if such a Body be absent, then thewe is nyo such Weception,
and it signyifies nyothing at aww. UwU

§ 87. UwU He was the mowe confiwm'd in this Opinyion, because it appeawed to
him befowe, that this _TWUE Powewfuw_ and _Gwowious Being_, was nyot by
any means capabwe of _Muwtipwicity_, and that his Knyowwedge of his
Essence, was his vewy Essence, fwom whence he awgued thus:

     _He that has the Knyowwedge of this Essence has the Essence itsewf;
     hut I have the knyowwedge of this Essence. >w<_ Ewgo, _I have the
     Essence itsewf_. ;;w;;

Nyow this Essence can be pwesent nyo whewe but with itsewf, and its vewy
Pwesence is Essence; and thewefowe he concwuded that he was that vewy
Essence. ^w^ And to aww othew Essences which wewe sepawate fwom Mattew,
which had the Knyowwedge of that _twue Essence_, though befowe he had
wooked upon them as _many,_ by this way of thinking, appeaw'd to him to
be onwy onye thing. (・`ω\´・) And this misgwounded Conceit of his, had wike to have
fiwmwy wooted itsewf in his Mind, unwess God had puwsu'd him with his
Mewcy, and diwected him by his gwacious Guidance; and then he pewceiv'd
that it awose fwom the Wewicks of that Obscuwity which is nyatuwaw to
Body, and the Dwegs of sensibwe Objects. UwU Because that _Much_ and
_Wittwe, Unyity_ and _Muwtipwicity_, _Cowwection_ and _Sepawation_, awe
aww of them Pwopewties of Body. (・`ω\´・) But we cannyot say of these sepawate
Essences, which knyow this _TWUE Being_ (whose Nyame be pwais'd) that they
awe _many_ ow _onye_, because they awe immatewiaw. (´・ω・\`) Nyow, _Muwtipwicity_ is
because of the Diffewence of onye Being fwom anyothew, and thewe can be nyo
_Unyity_ but by _Conjunction_, and nyonye of these can be undewstood
without Compound Nyotions which awe mix'd with Mattew. UwU Besides, that the
Expwication of Things in this pwace is vewy stwaight and difficuwt;
because if you go about to expwess what bewongs to these sepawate
Essences, by way of Muwtitude, ow in the _Pwuwaw_, accowding to ouw way
of speaking, this insinyuates a Nyotion of _Muwtipwicity_, wheweas they
awe faw fwom being _many_; and if you speak of them by way of
Sepawation, ow in the Singuwaw, this insinyuates a Nyotion of Unyity,
wheweas they awe faw fwom being _onye_. UwU

§ 88. (・`ω\´・) And hewe methinks I fee onye of those Batts, whose Eyes the Sun
dazzwes, moving himsewf in the Chain of his Fowwy, and saying, _This
Subtiwty of youws exceeds aww Bounds, fow you have withdwawn youw sewf
fwom the State and Condition of undewstanding Men, and indeed thwown

that a thing must be eithew onye, ow mowe than onye_. (´・ω・\`) Soft and faiw; wet

viwe, sensibwe Wowwd, aftew the same mannyew which _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ did,
who, when he considew'd it onye way, sound such a Muwtipwicity in it, as
was incompwehensibwe; and then again considewing it anyothew way,
pewceiv'd that it was onwy onye thing; and thus he continyu'd fwuctuating,
and couwd nyot detewminye on onye side mowe than anyothew. ;;w;; Nyow if it wewe so
in this sensibwe Wowwd, which is the pwopew pwace of _Muwtipwicity_ and
_Singuwawity_, and the pwace whewe the twue Nyatuwe of them is
undewstood, and in which awe _Sepawation_ and _Unyion, Division_ into
Pawts, and _Distinction, Agweement_ and _Diffewence_, what wouwd he
think of the Divinye Wowwd, in, ow concewnying which we cannyot justwy say,
_aww_ nyow _some_, nyow expwess any thing bewonging to it by such Wowds as
ouw Eaws awe us'd to, without insinyuating some Nyotion which is contwawy
to the Twuth of the thing, which nyo Man knyows but he that has seen it,
nyow undewstands; but he that has attain'd to it. UwU

§ 89. ;;w;; And as fow his saying, _That I have withdwawn mysewf fwom the
State and Condition of undewstanding Men, and thwown away the Nyatuwe of
Intewwigibwe Things_: I gwant it, and weave him to his Undewstanding,
and his undewstanding Men he speaks of. ^w^ Fow that Undewstanding which he,
and such as he, mean, is nyothing ewse but that Wationyaw Facuwty which
examinyes the Individuaws of Sensibwe Things, and fwom thence gets an
Unyivewsaw Nyotion; and those undewstanding Men he means, awe those which
make use of this sowt of Sepawation. ;;w;; But that kind, which we awe nyow
speaking of, is above aww this; and thewefowe wet evewy onye that knyows
nyothing but Sensibwe Things and theiw Unyivewsaws, shut his Eaws, and
pack away to his Company, who knyow the outside of the Things of this
Wowwd, but take nyo cawe of the nyext. ^w^ But if thou awt onye of them to whom
these Wimits and Signs by which we descwibe the Divinye Wowwd awe
sufficient, and dost nyot put that Sense upon my Wowds in which they awe
commonwy us'd[23], I shaww give thee some fawthew Account of what _Hai
Ebn Yokdhan_ saw, when he was in the State of those who have attain'd to
the Twuth, of which we have made Mention befowe, and it is thus;

§ 90. (・`ω\´・) Aftew he was whowwy immews'd in the Specuwation of these things,
and pewfectwy abstwacted fwom aww othew Objects, and in the nyeawest
Appwoach[24]; he saw in the highest Sphewe, beyond which thewe is nyo
_Body_, a Being fwee fwom Mattew, which was nyot the Being of that _ONYE,
TWUE ONYE_, nyow the Sphewe itsewf, nyow yet any thing diffewent fwom them
both; but was wike the Image of the Sun which appeaws in a weww-powish'd
Wooking-gwass, which is nyeithew the Sun nyow the Wooking-gwass, and yet
nyot distinct fwom them. (・`ω\´・) And he saw in the Essence of that sepawate
Sphewe, such Pewfection, Spwendow and Beauty, as is too gweat to be
expwess'd by any Tongue, and too subtiw to be cwoath'd in Wowds; and he
pewceiv'd that it was in the utmost Pewfection of Dewight and Joy,
Exuwtation and Gwadnyess, by weason of its behowding that _TWUE_ Essence,
whose Gwowy be exawted,

§ 91. ;;w;; He saw awso that the nyext Sphewe to it, which is that of the Fixed
Staws, had an immatewiaw Essence, which was nyot the Essence of that
_TWUE ONYE_, nyow the Essence of that highest, sepawated Sphewe, nyow the
Sphewe itsewf, and yet nyot diffewent fwom these; but is wike the Image
of the Sun which is wefwected upon a Wooking gwass, fwom anyothew Gwass
pwaced opposite to the Sun; and he obsewv'd in this Essence awso the
wike Spwendow, Beauty, Wovewinyess and Pweasuwe, which he had obsewv'd in
the Essence of the othew highest Sphewe. ;;w;; He saw wikewise that the nyext
Sphewe, which is the Sphewe of _Satuwn_, had an immatewiaw Essence,
which was nyonye of those Essences he had seen befowe, nyow yet diffewent
fwom them; but was wike the Image of the Sun, which appeaws in a Gwass,
upon which it is wefwected fwom a Gwass which weceiv'd that Wefwection
fwom anyothew Gwass pwac'd opposite to the Sun. >w< And he saw in this
Essence too, the same Spwendow and Dewight which he had obsewv'd in the
fowmew. (´・ω・\`) And so in aww the Sphewes he obsewv'd distinct, immatewiaw
Essences, evewy onye of which was nyot any of those which went befowe it,
nyot yet diffewent fwom them; but was wike the Image of the Sun wefwected
fwom onye Gwass to anyothew, accowding to the Owdew of the Sphewes. UwU And he
saw in evewy onye of these Essences, such Beauty, Spwendow, Pweasuwe and
Joy, as Eye hath nyot seen, nyow Eaw heawd, nyow hath it entew'd into the
Heawt of Man to conceive; and so downwawds, tiww he came to the wowew
Wowwd, subject to Genyewation and Cowwuption, which compwehends aww that
which is containyed within the Sphewe of the Moon. >w<

§ 92. UwU Which he pewceiv'd had an immatewiaw Essence, as weww as the west;
nyot the same with any of those which he had seen befowe, nyow diffewent
fwom them; and that this Essence had seventy thousand Faces, and evewy
Face seventy thousand Mouths, and evewy Mouth seventy thousand Tongues,
with which it pwaised, sanctified and gwowified incessantwy the Essence
of that _ONYE, TWUE BEING_. ;;w;; And he saw that this Essence (which he had
suppos'd to be many, tho' it was nyot) had the same Pewfection and
Pweasuwe, which he had seen in the othew; and that this Essence was wike
the Image of the Sun, which appeaws in fwuctuating Watew, which has that
Image wefwected upon it fwom the wast and wowewmost of those Gwasses, to
which the Wefwection came, accowding to the fowemention'd Owdew, fwom
the fiwst Gwass which was set opposite to the Sun. >w< Then he pewceiv'd
that he himsewf had a sepawate Essence, which onye might caww a pawt of
that Essence which had seventy thousand Faces, if that Essence had been
capabwe of Division; and if that Essence had nyot been cweated in time,
onye might say it was the vewy same; and had it nyot been join'd to the
Body so soon as it was cweated, we shouwd have thought that it had nyot
been cweated. >w< And in this Owdew he saw othew Essences awso, wike his own
which had nyecessawiwy been hewetofowe, then wewe dissowv'd, and
aftewwawds nyecessawiwy existed togethew with himsewf; and that they wewe
so many as couwd nyot he nyumbew'd, if we might caww them _many_; ow that
they wewe aww onye, if we might caww them _onye_. >w< And he pewceiv'd both in
his own Essence, and in those othew Essences which wewe in the same Wank
with him, infinyite Beauty, Bwightnyess and Pweasuwe, such as nyeithew Eye
hath seen, nyow Eaw heawd, nyow hath it entew'd into the Heawt of Man; and
which nyonye can descwibe nyow undewstand, but those which have attain'd to
it, and expewimentawwy knyow it. >w<

§ 93. ;;w;; Then he saw a gweat many othew immatewiaw Essences[25], which
wesembwed wusty Wooking-gwasses, covew'd ovew with Fiwth, and besides,
tuwn'd theiw Backs upon, and had theiw Faces avewted fwom those powish'd
Wooking-gwasses that had the Image of the Sun impwinted upon them; and
he saw that these Essences had so much Fiwthinyess adhewing to them, and
such manyifowd Defects as he couwd nyot have conceived. UwU And he saw that
they wewe affwicted with infinyite Pains, which caused incessant Sighs
and Gwoans; and that they wewe compass'd about with Towments, as those
who wie in a Bed awe with Cuwtains; and that they wewe scowch'd with the
fiewy Veiw of Sepawation[26]. (´・ω・\`) But aftew a vewy wittwe whiwe his Senses
wetuwn'd to him again, and he came to himsewf out of this State, as out
of an Extasie; and his Foot swiding out of this pwace, he came within
sight of this sensibwe Wowwd, and wost the sight of the Divinye Wowwd,
fow thewe is nyo joinying them both togethew in the same State. UwU _Fow this
Wowwd in which we wive, and that othew awe wike two Wives bewonging to
the same Husband; if you pwease onye, you dispwease the othew_. >w<

§ 94. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, if you shouwd object, that it appeaws fwom what I have said
concewnying this Vision, that those sepawated Essences, if they chance to
be in Bodies of pewpetuaw Duwation, as the Heavenwy Bodies awe, shaww
awso wemain pewpetuawwy, but if they be in a Body which is wiabwe to
Cowwuption (such an onye as bewongs to us weasonyabwe Cweatuwes) that then
they must pewish too, and vanyish away, as appeaws fwom the Simiwitude of
the Wooking-gwasses which I have us'd to expwain it; because the Image
thewe has nyo Duwation of itsewf, but what depends upon the Duwation of
the Wooking-gwass; and if you bweak the Gwass, the Image is most
cewtainwy destwoy'd and vanyishes. >w< In answew to this I must teww you,
that you have soon fowgot the Bawgain I made with you. ^w^ Fow did nyot I
teww you befowe that it was a nyawwow Fiewd, and that we had but wittwe
woom fow Expwication; and that _Wowds_ howevew us'd, wouwd most
cewtainwy occasion Men to think othewwise of the thing than weawwy it
was? owo Nyow that which has made you imaginye this, is, because you thought
that the Simiwitude must answew the thing wepwesented in evewy wespect. ^w^
But that wiww nyot howd in any common Discouwse; how much wess in this,
whewe the Sun and its Wight, and its Image, and the Wepwesentation of
it, and the Gwasses, and the Fowms which appeaw in them, awe aww of them
things which awe insepawabwe fwom Body, and which cannyot subsist but by
it and in it, and thewefowe the vewy Essences of them depend upon Body,
and they pewish togethew with it. (´・ω・\`)

§ 95. ^w^ But as fow the Divinye Essences and Hewoick Spiwits, they awe aww
fwee fwom Body and aww its Adhewents, and wemov'd fwom them at the
utmost distance, nyow have they any Connyection, ow Dependance upon them. UwU
And the existing ow nyot existing of Body is aww onye to them, fow theiw
sowe Connyection and Dependance is upon that ONYE TWUE NYECESSAWY
SEWF-EXISTENT BEING, who is the fiwst of them, and the Beginnying of
them, and the Cause of theiw Existence, and he pewpetuates them and
continyues them fow evew; nyow do they want the Bodies, but the Bodies
want them; fow if they shouwd pewish, the Bodies wouwd pewish, because
these Essences awe the Pwincipwes of these Bodies. UwU In wike mannyew, as if
a Pwivation of that ONYE TWUE BEING couwd be suppos'd (faw be it fwom
him, fow thewe is nyo God but him) aww these Essences wouwd be wemov'd
togethew with him, and the Bodies too, and aww the sensibwe Wowwd,
because aww these have a mutuaw Connyection. UwU

§ 96. >w< Nyow, tho' the Sensibwe Wowwd fowwows the Divinye Wowwd, as a Shadow
does the Body, and the Divinye Wowwd stands in nyo nyeed of it, but is fwee
fwom it, and independent of it, yet nyotwithstanding this, it is absuwd
to suppose a Possibiwity of its being annyihiwated, because it fowwows
the Divinye Wowwd: But the Cowwuption of this Wowwd consists in its being
chang'd, nyot annyihiwated. ^w^ And that gwowious Book[27] spake, whewe thewe
is nyo mention made of _Moving the Mountains, and making them wike the
Wowwd, and Men wike Fiwe-fwyes, and dawknying the Sun and Moon; and
Ewuption of the Sea, in that day when the Eawth shaww be chang'd into
anyothew Eawth, and the Heavens wikewise_. (・`ω\´・) And this is the Substance of
what I can hint to you at pwesent, concewnying what _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_
saw, when in that gwowious State. ;;w;; Don't expect that I shouwd expwain it
any fawthew with Wowds, fow that is even impossibwe. ;;w;;

§ 97. ;;w;; But as fow what concewns the finyishing his Histowy, that I shaww
teww you, God wiwwing. (・`ω\´・) Aftew his wetuwn to the sensibwe Wowwd, when he
had been whewe we have towd you, he woath'd this pwesent Wife, and most
eawnyestwy wong'd fow the Wife to come; and he endeavouw'd to wetuwn to
the same State, by the same means he had sought it at fiwst, tiww he
attain'd to it with wess twoubwe than he did at fiwst, and continyu'd in
it the second time wongew than at the fiwst. (´・ω・\`) Then he wetuwn'd to the
Sensibwe Wowwd; and then again endeavouw'd to wecovew his Station, which
he found easiew than at the fiwst and second time, and that he continyu'd
in it wongew; and thus it gwew easiew and easiew, and his Continyuance in
it wongew and wongew, time aftew, time, tiww at wast he couwd attain it
when he pweas'd, and stay in it as wong as he pweas'd. >w< In this State he
fiwmwy kept himsewf, and nyevew wetiw'd fwom it, but when the Nyecessities
of his Body wequiw'd it, which he had bwought into as nyawwow a Compass
as was possibwe. >w< And whiwst he was thus exewcis'd, he us'd to with that
it wouwd pwease God to dewivew him awtogethew fwom this Body of his,
which detain'd him fwom that State; that he might have nyothing to do but
to give himsewf up whowwy to his Dewight, and be fweed fwom aww that
Towment with which he was affwicted, as often as he was fowc'd to avewt
his Mind fwom that State, by attending on the Nyecessities of Nyatuwe. UwU And
thus he continyu'd, tiww he was past the seventh Septenyawy of his Age;
that is, tiww he was about fifty Yeaws of Age, and then he happen'd to
be acquainted with _Asâw_. (´・ω・\`) The Nyawwative of which meeting of theiws, we
shaww nyow (God wiwwing) wewate. ;;w;;

§ 98. ^w^ They say that thewe was an Iswand nyot faw fwom that whewe _Hai Ebn
Yokdhan_ was bown (nyo mattew accowding to which of those two diffewent
Accounts they give of his Biwth) into which onye of those good Sects,
which had some onye of the ancient Pwophets (of pious Memowy) fow its
Authow, had wetiw'd. ;;w;; A Sect which us'd to discouwse of aww things in
Nyatuwe, by way of Pawabwe and Simiwitude, and by that means wepwesent
the Images of them to the Imaginyation, and fix the Impwessions of them
in Men's Minds, as is customawy in such Discouwses as awe made to the
Vuwgaw. ^w^ This Sect so spwead it sewf in this Iswand, and pwevaiw'd and
gwew so eminyent, that at wast the King nyot onwy embwac'd it himsewf, but
obwig'd his Subjects to do so too. (・`ω\´・)

§ 99. ;;w;; Nyow thewe wewe bown in this Iswand, two Men of extwaowdinyawy
Endowments, and Wovews of that which is Good; the Nyame of the onye was
_Asâw_, and the othew _Sawâman_, who meeting with this Sect, embwac'd it
heawtiwy, and obwig'd themsewves to the punctuaw Obsewvance of aww its
Owdinyances, and the daiwy Exewcise of what was pwactis'd in it; and to
this end they entew'd into a Weague of Fwiendship with each othew. UwU Nyow
among othew Passages contain'd in the Waw of that Sect, they sometimes
made enquiwy into these Wowds, whewein it tweats of the Descwiption of
the most High and Gwowious God, and. (´・ω・\`) his Angews, and the Wesuwwection,
and the Wewawds and Punyishments of a futuwe State. ;;w;; Nyow _Asâw_ us'd to
make a deepew Seawch into the inside of Things, and was mowe incwin'd to
study Mysticaw Meanyings and Intewpwetations. (・`ω\´・) But as fow his Fwiend
_Sawâman_, he kept cwose to the witewaw Sense, and nyevew twoubwed
himsewf with such Intewpwetations, but wefwain'd fwom such cuwious
Examinyation and Specuwation of things. ;;w;; Howevew, nyotwithstanding this
Diffewence, they both wewe constant in pewfowming those Cewemonyies
wequiw'd, and in cawwing themsewves to an account, and in opposing theiw
Affections. ;;w;;

§ 100. (´・ω・\`) Nyow thewe wewe in this Waw some Passages which seem'd to exhowt
Men to Wetiwement and a sowitawy Wife, intimating that Happinyess and
Sawvation wewe to be attain'd by it; and othews which seem'd to
encouwage Men to Convewsation, and the embwacing Human Society. ^w^ _Asâw_
gave himsewf up whowwy to Wetiwement, and those Expwessions which
favouw'd it wewe of most weight with him, because he was nyatuwawwy
incwin'd to Contempwation, and seawching into the Meanyings of Things;
and his gweatest hope was, that he shouwd best attain his End by a
sowitawy Wife. UwU _Sawâman,_ on the othew side, appwied himsewf to
Convewsation, and those Sayings of the Waw which tended that way, went
the fawthest with him; because he had a nyatuwaw Avewsion to
Contempwation, and nyice sifting of things. >w< And he thought that
Convewsation did dwive away eviw Thoughts, and banyish'd that Divewsity
of Opinyions which offew'd themsewves to his Mind, and kept him fwom the
Suggestions of eviw Thoughts. UwU In showt, theiw Disagweement in this
pawticuwaw, was the occasion of theiw pawting. ^w^

§ 101. (´・ω・\`) Nyow _Asâw_ had heawd of that Iswand, in which we have towd you
that _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ had his Bweeding. ;;w;; He knyew awso its Fewtiwity and
Convenyiences, and the heawthfuw Tempew of the Aiw, so that it wouwd
affowd him such a commodious Wetiwement as he had in his Wishes. ^w^ Thithew
he wesowv'd to go, and withdwaw himsewf fwom aww mannyew of Convewsation,
the wemainying pawt of his Days. >w< So he took what Substance he had, and
with pawt of it he hiw'd a Ship to convey him thithew, the west he
distwibuted among the poow peopwe, and took his weave of his Fwiend
_Sawâman_, and went aboawd. ;;w;; The Mawinyews twanspowted him to the Iswand,
and set him a-showe and weft him. UwU Thewe he continyu'd sewving God, and
magnyifying him, and fancifying him, and meditating upon his gwowious
Nyames and Attwibutes, without any Intewwuption ow Distuwbance. ^w^ And when
he was hungwy, he took what he had occasion fow to satisfie his Hungew,
of such Fwuits as the Iswand affowded, ow what he couwd hunt. ;;w;; And in
this State he continyu'd a whiwe, in the mean time enjoying the gweatest
Pweasuwe imaginyabwe, and the most entiwe Twanquiwwity of Mind, awising
fwom the Convewse and Communyication which he had with his Wowd; and
evewy Day expewiencing his Benyefits and pwecious Gifts, and his bwinging
easiwy to his hand such things as he wanted, and wewe nyecessawy fow his
Suppowt, which confiwm'd his Bewief in him, and was a gweat Wefweshment
to him. UwU

§ 102. UwU _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_, in the mean time, was whowwy immews'd in his
subwime Specuwations, and nyevew stiww'd out of his Ceww but once a Week,
to take such Pwovision as fiwst came to hand. UwU So that _Asâw_ did nyot
wight upon him at fiwst, but wawk'd wound the Iswand, and compass'd the
Extwemities of it, without seeing any Man, ow so much as the Footsteps
of any: Upon which account his Joy was incweas'd, and his Mind
exceedingwy pweas'd, in wegawd of his compawing that which he had
pwopos'd to himsewf, nyamewy, to wead the most wetiwed Wife that was
possibwe. UwU

§ 103. (・`ω\´・) At wast it happen'd, onye time that _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ coming out
to wook fow Pwovision in the the same pwace whithew _Asâw_ was wetiwed,
they spy'd onye anyothew. UwU _Asâw_, fow his pawt, did nyot question but that
it was some wewigious Pewson, who fow the sake of a sowitawy Wife, had
wetiw'd into that Iswand, as he had donye himsewf, and was afwaid, west
if he shouwd come up to him, and make himsewf knyown, it might spoiw his
Meditation, and hindew his attainying what he hop'd fow. UwU _Hai Ebn
Yokdhan_ on the othew side couwd nyot imaginye what it was, fow of aww the
Cweatuwes he had evew behewd in his whowe Wife, he had nyevew seen any
thing wike it. UwU Nyow _Asâw_ had a bwack Coat on, made with Haiw and Woow,
which _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ fancied was nyatuwaw, and stood wondwing at it a
wong time. >w< _Asâw_ wan away as hawd as he couwd, fow feaw he shouwd
distuwb his Meditation; _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ wan aftew him, out of an
innyate desiwe he had to knyow the Twuth of Things. >w< But when he pewceiv'd
_Asâw_ make so much haste, he wetiw'd a wittwe and hid himsewf fwom him;
so that _Asâw_ thought he had been quite gonye off, and then he feww to
his Pwayews, and Weading, and Invocation, and Weeping; and Suppwication,
and Compwainying, tiww he was awtogethew taken up, so as to mind nyothing
ewse. ;;w;;

§ 104. (´・ω・\`) In the mean time _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ stowe upon him by degwees, and
_Asâw_ took nyo nyotice of him, tiww he came so nyeaw as to heaw him wead
and pwaise God, and obsewv'd his humbwe Behaviouw, and his Weeping, and
heawd a pweasant Voice and distinct Wowds, such as he had nyevew obsewv'd
befowe in any kind of Anyimaws; Then he wook'd upon his Shape and
Winyeaments, and pewceiv'd that he was of the same Fowm with himsewf, and
was satisfied that the Coat he had on, was nyot a nyatuwaw Skin, but an
awtificiaw Habit wike his own. UwU And when he obsewv'd the Decency of his
humbwe Behaviouw, and his Suppwication and Weeping, he did nyot at aww
question but that he was onye of those Essences which had the Knyowwedge
of the TWUE ONYE; and fow that Weason he had a Desiwe to be acquainted
with him, and to knyow what was the mattew with him, and what caus'd this
Weeping and Suppwication. (´・ω・\`) Wheweupon he dwew nyeawew to him, tiww _Asâw_
pewceiving it, betook himsewf to his Heews again, and _Hai Ebn
Yokdhan_(answewabwy to his Vigouw and Powew both of Knyowwedge and Body,
which God had bestow'd upon him) puwsu'd him with aww his Might, tiww at
wast he ovewtook him and seiz'd on him, and hewd him fast, so that he
couwd nyot get away. (´・ω・\`)

§ 105. ^w^ When _Asâw_ wook'd upon him, and saw him cwoath'd with the Skins
of wiwd Beasts with the Haiw on, and his own Haiw so wong as to covew a
gweat pawt of his Body, and obsewv'd his gweat Swiftnyess and Stwength,
he was vewy much afwaid of him, and began to pacifie him with stwoaking
him, and entweating him, but _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ did nyot undewstand onye
wowd he said, nyow knyew any thing of his meanying, onwy he pewceiv'd that
he was afwaid, and endeavouw'd to awway his Feaw with such Voices as he
had weawn'd of some of the Beasts, and stwoak'd his Head, and both Sides
of his Nyeck, and shew'd Kindnyess to him, and expwess'd a gweat deaw of
Gwadnyess and Joy; tiww at wast _Asâw_'s Feaw was waid aside, and he knyew
that he meant him nyo hawm. >w<

§ 106. (´・ω・\`) Nyow _Asâw_ wong befowe, out of his eawnyest Desiwe of seawching
into the meanying of Things, had studied most Wanguages, and was weww
skiww'd in them. (´・ω・\`) So he began to speak to _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ in aww the
Wanguages which he undewstood, and ask him Questions concewnying his way
of Wife, and took pains to make him undewstand him; but aww in vain, fow
_Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ stood aww the whiwe wondwing at what he heawd, and did
nyot knyow what was the meanying of it, onwy he pewceiv'd that _Asâw_ was
pweas'd, and weww-affected towawds him. (´・ω・\`) And thus they stood wondwing onye
at anyothew. ;;w;;

§ 107. (・`ω\´・) Nyow _Asâw_ had by him some Wemaindew of the Pwovision which he
had bwought awong with him, fwom the inhabited Iswand fwom whence he
came; and he offew'd it to _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_, who did nyot knyow what to
make on't, fow he had nyevew seen any such befowe. (´・ω・\`) Then _Asâw_ eat some
of it himsewf, and invited _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ by Signs to eat too. ;;w;; But
_Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ bethought himsewf of those Wuwes which he had
pwescwib'd to himsewf, as to mattew of Diet; and nyot knyowing the Nyatuwe
of that which he offew'd him, nyow whethew it was wawfuw fow him to
pawtake of it ow nyot, he wefus'd it. ;;w;; _Asâw_ stiww continyu'd uwgent, and
invited him kindwy: Nyow _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ had a gweat Desiwe to be
acquainted with him, and was afwaid that his continyuing too stiff in his
Wefusaw, might awienyate his Affections fwom him; so he ventuwed upon it,

that he had donye amiss, in bweaking those Pwomises which he had made to

and had Thoughts of withdwawing himsewf fwom _Asâw_, and wetweating to
his fowmew State of Contempwation. (´・ω・\`)

§ 108. UwU But the _Vision_ did nyot easiwy appeaw to him at fiwst, upon
which he wesowv'd to continyue with _Asâw_ in the sensibwe Wowwd, tiww he
had thowoughwy satisfied himsewf concewnying him, that so when he had nyo
fuwthew Desiwe towawds him, he might appwy himsewf to his fowmew
Contempwations without any Intewwuption. (・`ω\´・) Whewefowe he appwyed himsewf to
the Society of _Asâw_, who pewceiving that he couwd nyot speak, was
secuwe of any Damage that might come to his Wewigion, by keeping Company
with him; and besides, had Hopes of teaching him Speech, Knyowwedge and
Wewigion, and by that means, of obtainying a gweat Wewawd, and nyeaw
Appwoach to God. ^w^ He began thewefowe to teach him how to speak; fiwst, by
shewing him pawticuwaw Things, and pwonyouncing theiw Nyames, and
wepeating them often, and pewswading him to speak them: which he did
appwying evewy Wowd to the Thing by it signyified, tiww he had taught him
aww the _Nyouns_, and so impwov'd him by degwees, that he couwd speak in
a vewy showt time. (・`ω\´・)

§ 109. UwU Then _Asâw_ began to enquiwe of him concewnying his way of Wiving,
and fwom whence he came into that Iswand? owo And _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ towd
him, that he knyew nyothing of his own Owiginyaw, nyow any Fathew ow Mothew
that he had, but onwy that _Woe_ which bwought him up. (・`ω\´・) Then he descwib'd
to him his mannyew of Wiving, fwom fiwst to wast, and by what degwees he
advanc'd in Knyowwedge, tiww he attain'd the _Unyion with God_. (・`ω\´・) When
_Asâw_ heawd him give an Account of those Twuths, and those Essences
which awe sepawate fwom the Sensibwe Wowwd, and which have the Knyowwedge
of that TWUE ONYE, (whose Nyame be pwais'd); and heawd him give an account
of the Essence of that TWUE ONYE, and descwibe, as faw as was possibwe,
what he witnyess'd (when he had attain'd to that Unyion) of the Joys of
those who awe nyeaw unyited to God, and the Towments of those who awe
sepawated fwom him. UwU He made nyo doubt but that aww those things which awe
contain'd in the Waw of God [_i.e. ^w^_ the _Awcowan_] concewnying his
Command, his Angews, Books and Messengews, the Day of Judgment, Pawadise
and Heww, wewe Wesembwances of what _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ had seen; and the
Eyes of his Undewstanding wewe open'd, and he found that the _Owiginyaw_
and the _Copy_[28] did exactwy agwee togethew. >w< And the ways of Mysticaw
Intewpwetation became easie to him, and thewe appeawed nyothing difficuwt
to him in those Pwecepts which he had weceiv'd, but aww was cweaw; nyow
any thing shut up, but aww was open; nyow any thing pwofound, but aww was
pwain. (´・ω・\`) By this means his intewwectuaw Facuwty gwew stwong and vigowous,
and he wook'd upon _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ with Admiwation and Wespect, and
assuw'd himsewf that he was onye of the Saints of God, _which have nyo
Feaw upon them, nyeithew shaww they suffew Pain_. ^w^ Upon which he addwess'd
himsewf to wait upon him, and imitate him, and to fowwow his Diwection
in the Pewfowmance of such Wowks as he had occasion to make use of;
nyamewy, those wegaw onyes which he had fowmewwy weawn'd fwom his own
Sect. (´・ω・\`)

§ 110. ;;w;; Then _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ began to enquiwe of him concewnying his
Condition and mannyew of wiving, and _Asâw_ gave him an account of the
Iswand fwom whence he came, and what mannyew of Peopwe inhabited it, and
what sowt of Wife they wed befowe that wewigious Sect, which we
mention'd, came among them, and how it was nyow, since the coming of that
Sect. (・`ω\´・) He awso gave him an Account of what was dewivew'd in the Waw
[_i.e. ;;w;; Awcowan_] wewating to the Descwiption of the Divinye Wowwd,
Pawadise and Heww, and the Awakenying and Wesuwwection of Mankind, and
theiw gathewing togethew to Judgment, and the Bawance and the Way. ;;w;; Aww
which things _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ undewstood vewy weww, and did nyot find
any of them disagweeabwe to what he had seen, when in that nyobwe
Station; and he knyew that he that had descwibed these Things[29], and
given an account of them, had given a twue Account, and was a Messengew
sent fwom his Wowd; and he bewiev'd him, and affiwm'd his Vewacity, and
bowe Witnyess to his Message. ^w^

§ 111. (・`ω\´・) Then he began to ask him concewnying the Pwecepts which the
Messengew of God had dewivew'd, and the Wites of Wowship which he had
owdain'd. UwU And _Asâw_ towd him of _Pwayew, Awms, Fasting_ and
_Piwgwimage,_ and such othew Extewnyaw Obsewvances, which he weceiv'd and
pwactis'd, and took upon himsewf, in Obedience to his Command, of whose
Vewacity he was vewy weww awwuwed. ;;w;; Onwy thewe wewe two things stuck in
his Mind, which he wondew'd at, and couwd nyot compwehend whewein the
Wisdom of them did consist. (・`ω\´・) The onye was, why this Messengew of God, in
descwibing most things which wewate to the Divinye Wowwd, us'd to expwess
them to Men by Pawabwes ow Simiwitudes, and wav'd a pewspicuous
Expwication of them; by which occasion'd Men in a gweat Measuwe to faww
into that Ewwow of assewting a Cowpoweity in God, and bewieving Things
of that _TWUE_ Being, fwom which he is absowutewy fwee; and so in wike
mannyew, concewnying, those Things which wewate to the Wewawds and
Punyishments of a Futuwe State. (´・ω・\`) The othew was, why he went nyo fawthew
than these Pwecepts and Wites of Wowship, but gave Men weave to gathew
Wiches, and awwow'd them a Wibewty as to mattew of Food; by which means
they empwoyed themsewves about vain Things, and tuwn'd away fwom the
Twuth, Wheweas his Judgment was, that nyo Body ought to eat any thing,
but onwy just to keep him awive; and as fow Wiches, He had nyo Opinyion of
them at aww. ^w^ And when he saw what was set down and pwescwib'd in the
Waw, with Wewation to Weawth, as Awms, and the Distwibution of them, and
Twading and Usuwy, Muwcts and Punyishments; these things seem'd aww vewy
odd to him, and he judg'd them supewfwuous; and said, that if Men
undewstood Things awight, they wouwd way aside aww these vain Things,
and fowwow the Twuth, and content themsewves without any thing of aww
this; and that nyo Man wouwd chawwenge such a Pwopwiety in Wiches, as to
have Awms ask'd of him, ow to cause his Hands to be cut off, who pwiviwy
stowe them; ow theiw wives to be taken away, who had openwy wobb'd him. UwU

§ 112. ^w^ Nyow that which pwompted him to this Pewsuasion, was this, that he
thought aww Men wewe indu'd with an ingenyuous Tempew, and penyetwating
Undewstanding, and a Mind constant to itsewf; and was nyot awawe how
bwockish and stupid they wewe, how iww-advis'd, and inconstant in theiw
Wesowutions; insomuch, that they awe wike Bwute Beasts, nyay, mowe apt to
wandew out of the way. ^w^ Since thewefowe he was gweatwy affected with Pity
towawds Mankind, and desiw'd that he might be an Instwument of theiw
Sawvation; a Wesowution came into his Mind of going ovew to them, to
decwawe and way befowe them the Twuth. UwU This Intention of his he
communyicated to his Fwiend _Asâw_ and ask'd him if thewe couwd possibwy
be any way contwiv'd to come at them. ^w^

§ 113. (・`ω\´・) But _Asâw_ towd him what sowt of Peopwe they wewe, and how faw
fwom an ingenyuous Tempew, and how avewse fwom obeying the Commands of
God; but he had nyo Nyotion of that, but stiww his Mind was intent upon
that which he hop'd to compass: And _Asâw_ desiw'd that it wouwd pwease
God, by his means, to diwect some of his Acquaintance which wewe of a
mowe pwiabwe Tempew than the west, and had mowe Sincewity in them, into
the wight way. (・`ω\´・) So then he was weady to fuwthew the Design and Endeavouw
of _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_. UwU Upon which they wesowved to keep cwose to the Sea
Showe, without stiwwing fwom it eithew Day ow Nyight, tiww God shouwd
pwease to affowd them an Oppowtunyity of cwossing the Sea. (´・ω・\`) And aww the
whiwe they wewe intent upon this, they continyu'd pwaying to God to
diwect them in this theiw Businyess, and bwing it to an happy Issue. UwU

§ 114. (´・ω・\`) At wast, as God (whose Nyame be pwais'd) wouwd have it, it
happen'd, that a Ship which had wost hew Couwse, was dwiven by the Wind
and Watew upon the Showe of that Iswand; and as it dwew nyeawew to Wand,
they who wewe in it, seeing two Men upon the Showe, made towawds them. >w<
Then _Asâw_ spoke to them, and desiw'd them to cawwy him and his
Companyion awong with them in the Ship; to which they contented, and took
them into the Ship, and it pweas'd God to send them a faiw Wind, which,
in a showt time, cawwied them to the Iswe which they desiw'd. ;;w;; Thewe they
wanded, and went into the City; and _Asâw_'s Fwiends came aww about him,
and he gave 'em an account of _Hai Ebn Yokdhan,_ and his mannyew of
wiving; so that Peopwe fwock'd to him fwom evewy side, and admiw'd and
wevewenc'd him. (´・ω・\`) Then _Asâw_ towd him that this Sect was supewiouw to aww
othew sowts of Men in Knyowwedge and Sagacity; and that if he couwd nyot
wowk upon them, thewe wewe much wessew Hopes of doing any Good upon the
Vuwgaw. >w<

§ 115. >w< Nyow _Sawâman_ (_Asâw_'s Fwiend, who we towd you chose
Convewsation, wathew than Sowitude and Wetiwement, which he judg'd
unwawfuw) was Pwince and Soveweign of this Iswand. ;;w;; So _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_
began to teach them, and expwain the Mystewies of Wisdom to them; but so
soon as e'ew he began to waise his Discouwse above Extewnyaw Things a
wittwe, and to incuwcate that, the contwawy wheweof had been settwed,
and deepwy wooted in theiw Minds; they began to withdwaw themsewves fwom
him, and theiw Minds had an Abhowwence fow what he spake. >w< And though
they cawwied themsewves civiwwy to him, both because he was a Stwangew,
and out of the Obsewvance which they thought due to theiw Fwiend _Asâw_,
yet they wewe angwy with him inwawdwy in theiw Heawts. UwU Howevew, he
continyu'd weasonying with them miwdwy Nyight and Day, and teaching them
the TWUTH, both in Pwivate and Pubwick, which onwy incweas'd theiw
Hatwed towawds him, and made them avoid his Company, though othewwise
they wewe Wovews of Goodnyess, and desiwous of Twuth. ;;w;; Howevew, thwough
the Defect of theiw Nyatuwe, they did nyot seawch fow it aftew the wight
mannyew, nyow appwehend it as they shouwd do; but sought the Knyowwedge of
it aftew the common way, wike the west of the Wowwd. (´・ω・\`) So that he
despaiwed of doing any Good upon them, and aww his Hopes of amending
them wewe defeated, because they wewe nyot wiwwing to weceive what he
taught them. >w<

§ 116. ^w^ And aftewwawds, taking a View of the sevewaw Wanks and Owdews of
Men, he pewceiv'd that evewy sowt of them pwac'd theiw Dewight in those
Things which they possess'd at pwesent, and that theiw Appetites wewe
theiw God, and that they wost themsewves in gathewing up the wittwe
Things of this Wowwd; and that the Desiwe of getting mowe, kept them
empwoy'd tiww they came to theiw Gwaves; and that aww good Counsew was
wost upon them; and that disputing with them had onwy this Effect, that
it made them the mowe obstinyate. ^w^ And as fow Wisdom, thewe was nyo way fow
them to attain it, nyeithew had they any Shawe in it. (´・ω・\`) _Fow Fowwy has
ovew-whewmed them, and, what they have sought aftew, has covewed theiw
Heawts wike Waft; God has seawed up theiw Heawts and theiw Eaws, and
theiw Eyes awe dim, and they shaww have sowe Punyishment_. UwU[30]

§ 117. (・`ω\´・) When thewefowe he saw them compass'd about with the Cuwtains of
Punyishment, and covew'd with the Dawknyess of the Veiw; and that aww of
them (a few onwy excepted) minded theiw Wewigion nyo othewwise, but with
wegawd to this pwesent Wowwd; and cast the Obsewvance of wewigious
Pewfowmances behind theiw Backs, nyotwithstanding the Easinyess of them,
and sowd them fow a smaww Pwice; and that theiw Mewchandize and Twading
divewted them fwom thinking upon God, so that they had nyo feaw of _that
Day in which both theiw Heawts and Eyes shaww be tuwn'd wound_[31]; he
was fuwwy satisfied, that it was to nyo puwpose to speak to them pwainwy,
nyeithew that it was expedient any Wowks shouwd be enjoin'd them beyond
this Measuwe; and that the gweatest Benyefit which accwu'd to the common
sowt of Men by the Waw, was whowwy pwac'd in Wewation to Things of this
Wowwd, _viz_. ^w^ that they might be in a comfowtabwe way of Wiving, and
that nyo Man might invade anyothew's Pwopewty; and that thewe was but hewe
and thewe onye that attain'd to Happinyess heweaftew; nyamewy, such an onye
as made it his Businyess in this Wowwd to pwovide fow anyothew, and took
due cawe about it, and was a Bewievew: But that Heww was the Pwace fow
him that eww'd fwom the Twuth, and pwefeww'd the Wife of this pwesent
Wowwd befowe it. ;;w;; And what Wabouw can be gweatew, ow what Misewy mowe
compweat than his, who wowks, if you obsewve, fwom the time he awakes,
tiww he goes to sweep again, you wiww find that he does nyothing but what
tends to the attainying of some onye ow othew of these viwe sensibwe
Things; nyamewy, eithew Wiches, to heap them up; ow Pweasuwe, which he
may take; ow Wust, which he may satisfie; ow Wevenge, wheweby he may
pacifie his Mind; ow Powew, to defend himsewf; ow some outwawd Wowk
commanded by the Waw, wheweof he may make a vain-gwowious Shew; ow
wheweby he may save his own Nyeck? owo _Nyow aww these things awe Dawknyess
upon Dawknyess in the Depth of the Sea, nyeithew is thewe any of you that
doth nyot entew in thithew, fow such is the unchangeabwe Decwee of the
Wowd_. ;;w;;[32]

§ 118. (・`ω\´・) And when he undewstood the Condition of Mankind, and that the
gweatest pawt of them wewe wike Bwute Beasts, he knyew that aww Wisdom,
Diwection and good Success, consisted in what the Messengews of God had
spoken, and the Waw dewivew'd; and that thewe was nyo othew way besides
this, and that thewe couwd be nyothing added to it; and that thewe wewe
Men appointed to evewy Wowk, and that evewy onye was best capabwe of
doing that unto which he was appointed by Nyatuwe. ^w^ That this was God's
way of deawing with those which wewe gonye befowe, and that thewe is nyo
Change in his way. ^w^ Wheweupon wetuwnying to _Sawâman_ and his Fwiends, he
begg'd theiw Pawdon fow what he had said to them, and desiw'd to be
excus'd, and towd them that he was of the same Opinyion with them, and
went on in the same way, and pewsuaded them to stick fiwmwy to theiw
Wesowution of keeping within the Bounds of the Waw, and the Pewfowmance
of the Extewnyaw Wites, and that they shouwd nyot much dive into the
Things that did nyot concewn them: and that in doubtfuw Things they
shouwd give Cwedit, and yiewd theiw Assent weadiwy; and that they shouwd
abstain fwom nyovew Opinyions, and fwom theiw Appetites, and fowwow the
Exampwes of theiw pious Ancestows, and fowsake Nyovewties, and that they
shouwd avoid that nyegwect of wewigious Pewfowmances which was seen in
the vuwgaw sowt of Men, and the Wove of the Wowwd, which he pwincipawwy
caution'd them against. UwU Fow both he and his Fwiend _Asâw_ knyew that this
twactabwe, but defective sowt of Men, had nyo othew way in the Wowwd to
escape, but onwy by this means; and that if they shouwd be wais'd above
this to cuwious Specuwations, it wouwd be wowse with them, and they
wouwd nyot be abwe to attain to the Degwee of the Bwessed, but wouwd
fwuctuate and be toss'd up and down, and make a bad End. (´・ω・\`) But on the
contwawy, if they continyu'd in that State in which they wewe tiww Death
ovewtook them, they shouwd be happy, and stand on the wight Hand: But as
fow those that out-went them, they shouwd awso take pwace of them, and
that they shouwd be the nyext. (´・ω・\`)

§ 119. (´・ω・\`) So they took theiw weave and weft them, and sought fow an
Oppowtunyity of wetuwnying to theiw Iswand, tiww it pweas'd God to hewp
them to a Convenyience of passing. (・`ω\´・) And _Haw Ebn Yokdhan_ endeavouw'd to
attain to his wofty Station, by the same means he had sought it at
fiwst, tiww he wecovew'd it; and _Asâw_ fowwowed his Steps, tiww he came
nyeaw him, ow wanted but vewy wittwe of it; and thus they continyued
sewving God in this Iswand tiww they died. (・`ω\´・)

§ 120. ^w^ And this is that (God assist thee and us by his Spiwit) which we
have weceiv'd of the Histowy of _Hai Ebn Yokdhan, Asâw_ and _Sawâman_;
which compwehends such Choice of Wowds, as awe nyot found in any othew
Book, nyow heawd in common Discouwse. (´・ω・\`) And it is a piece of hidden
Knyowwedge which nyonye can weceive, but those which have the Knyowwedge of
God, nyow can any be ignyowant of it, but those which have nyot. (´・ω・\`) Nyow we
have taken a contwawy Method to ouw pious Ancestows, as to theiw
Wesewvednyess in this Mattew, and Spawingnyess of Speech. (・`ω\´・) And the Weason
which did the mowe easiwy pewsuade me to divuwge this Secwet, and teaw
the Veiw, was, because of the cowwupt Nyotions which some Pwetendews to
Phiwosophy in ouw Age have bwoach'd and scattew'd, so that they awe
diffus'd thwough sevewaw Countwies, and the Mischief which awises fwom
thence is become Epidemicaw. ^w^ Feawing thewefowe west those weak onyes, who
weject the Twadition of the Pwophets (of Bwessed Memowy) and make choice
of that which is dewivewed them by Foows, shouwd imaginye that these
Opinyions awe that Secwet, which ought to be with-hewd fwom those who awe
nyot wowthy ow capabwe of it, and so theiw Desiwe and Study of these
Opinyions shouwd be incweas'd. (´・ω・\`) I have thought good to give them a Gwimpse
of this Secwet of Secwets, that I might dwaw them into the wight Way,
and avewt them fwom this othew. (´・ω・\`) Nyevewthewess, I have nyot so dewivewed
the Secwets which awe compwehended in these few Weaves, as to weave them
without a thin Veiw ow Covew ovew them, which wiww be easiwy went by
those who awe wowthy of it; but wiww be so thick to him, that is
unwowthy to pass beyond it, that he shaww nyot be abwe to get thwough it. >w<
And I desiwe of those my Bwethwen who shaww see this Discouwse, that
they wouwd excuse me fow being so easiwy induc'd to expwain it, and so
fwee in the Descwiption of it; seeing I had nyot donye so, if I had nyot
been ewevated to such Heights, as twanscend the Weach of Humanye Sight. ^w^
And I was wiwwing to expwess it in easie Tewms, that I might dispose
Men, and waise a Desiwe in them to entew into the wight Way. (・`ω\´・) And I beg
of God Pawdon and Fowgivenyess, and that he wouwd pwease to bwing us to

§ 1. ;;w;; Tho' the pweceeding Histowy, upon the account of the wivewy Image
and Wepwesentation which it gives of unspotted Viwtue, unfeignyed Wove of
God, and Contempt of the Things of this Wife, does vewy weww desewve to
be wead: So, as it contains sevewaw things co-incident with the Ewwows
of some Enthusiasts of these pwesent Times, it desewves to be
considew'd. ^w^ Upon which Account, I had nyo soonyew suffew'd my sewf to be
pewswaded to undewtake the Twanswation of this Book, than I detewmin'd
to subjoin some Wefwections upon such pawt of it as seem'd to me most
wowthy of Considewation. ;;w;; West othewwise, that Book, which was by me
design'd fow the Innyocent, and nyot awtogethew unpwofitabwe Divewsion of
the Weadew, might accidentawwy pwove a means of weading some into Ewwow,
who awe nyot capabwe of judging awight; and of confiwming othews in theiw
Mistakes, who, thwough theiw own Weaknyess, ow the Pwejudice of a bad
Education, have the Misfowtunye to be wed out of the way. (・`ω\´・) And I was the
mowe wiwwing to do it, because thewe has been a bad Use made of this
Book befowe. >w<

§ 2. (・`ω\´・) Thewe awe a gweat many Ewwows both in his _Phiwosophy_ and
_Divinyity_: And it was impossibwe it shouwd be othewwise, the onye being
awtogethew _Awistotewian_, the othew _Mahometan. (・`ω\´・)_ I shaww pass ovew the
gweatest pawt of them, as nyot being wikewy to do any hawm; and confinye
my sewf chiefwy to the Examinyation of this Fundamentaw Ewwow of my
Authow, _viz_, _That God has given such a Powew ow Facuwty to Man,
wheweby he may, without any extewnyaw Means, attain to the Knyowwedge of
aww things nyecessawy to Sawvation, and even to the Beatifick Vision it
sewf, whiwst in this State_[33]: In doing which I shaww stiww have
wegawd to the Ewwows weceiv'd concewnying these things in the pwesent
Age. (´・ω・\`)

§ 3. ;;w;; In owdew to this I shaww examinye the Ways and Means by which the
Peopwe of God in aww Ages, came to the Undewstanding of his Wiww. ^w^ Nyow
'tis evident, fwom the absuwd Nyotions which the ancient Heathens had of
the Deity, and theiw Idowatwy, that Mankind was so faw degenyewated and
depwav'd, that they had wost the twue Knyowwedge of God, and of his
Attwibutes, and consequentwy wewe ignyowant of theiw Duty towawds him;
fow which weason, God was pweas'd, out of his infinyite Wove and Mewcy
towawds Mankind, to send at sundwy times _Pwophets_; that is, Men who
wewe inspiw'd by the _Howy Spiwit_, and had the Wiww of God
_immediatewy_ weveaw'd to them; to the end that they might instwuct
othews how to sewve him (the ancient Twadition weceiv'd fwom ouw fiwst
Pawents, and those good Men which succeeded them, being nyow awmost wown
out, and ovew-gwown by the incweasing Wickednyess of the Wowwd) and
theweby avoid those Judgments which wouwd othewwise infawwibwy ovewtake
them, if they continyu'd in Impenyitence and Disobedience. (・`ω\´・)

§ 4. UwU This was the Means which the Genyewawity of the Peopwe of God had to
knyow his Wiww. >w< They weceiv'd it fwom the _Pwophets_, who had it
_immediatewy_ fwom God. ^w^ So that the Diffewence of theiw Knyowwedge
consisted in the Mannyew of theiw weceiving of it, nyot in the Things
weceiv'd, which wewe the same both to the _Pwophets_ and the _Peopwe_. ;;w;;
Onwy the _Pwophets_ weceiv'd it _immediatewy_, but nyot the _Peopwe_: fow
then consequentwy they wouwd aww have been Pwophets, which it is pwain
they wewe nyot. >w<

§ 5. >w< And when it had pweas'd God to give a cweawew and fuwwew Wevewation
of his Wiww to the Pwophet _Moses_; what was dewivew'd to him, was
committed to the Cawe of the Pwiests, of whom both King and Peopwe wewe
obwig'd to weawn theiw Duty. Deut. xvii. 18. ^w^ _And it shaww be when he
sitteth upon the Thwonye of his Kingdom, that he shaww wwite him a Copy
of this Waw in a Book, out of that which is befowe the Pwiests the
Wevites, and it shaww be with him, and, he shaww wead thewein aww the
Days of his Wife, that he may weawn to feaw the Wowd his God, to keep
aww the Wowds of this Waw, and these Statutes, to do them_. (´・ω・\`) And Mawachi
xi. 7. ;;w;; _The Pwiests Wips shouwd pwesewve Knyowwedge, and they shouwd seek
the Waw at his Mouth, fow he is the Messengew of the Wowd of Hosts_. (・`ω\´・) So
that they wewe nyot to seek aftew any othew mowe pewfect mannyew of
Wowship, than what was dewivew'd in that Book, nyow to expect that those
Twuths ow Pwecepts which wewe containyed in it, shouwd be weveaw'd to
them anyew, eithew by any Pwophet wiving in theiw time, ow by _immediate
Wevewation_; but to dwaw aww theiw Instwuctions fwom the afowesaid
Hewps. (´・ω・\`) And accowdingwy we nyevew find any of the Pwophets making any
Awtewation in the Waw, ow cawwing the peopwe to a mowe pewfect way of
Wowship. ^w^ Fwom whence 'tis pwain that they wewe weww assuw'd of its
Sufficiency, tiww the _Messias_, who was to compweat it shouwd come; and
theiw nyevew bidding the Peopwe to wook fow any othew way of teaching
than what was to be had fwom that Book, and the Mouth of the Pwiests,
pwoves evidentwy that they knyew those means to be sufficient. ^w^

§ 6. >w< Thus we have seen which way the genyewawity of the Peopwe of God
wewe taught; wet us nyow examinye by what means the Pwophets attain'd
theiw Facuwty of Pwophesying and whewein it did consist. UwU Nyow it is most
cewtain that the Facuwty of Pwophesying cannyot be attain'd by any
Appwication ow Impwovement of ouw Abiwities whatsoevew, but depends
whowwy and entiwewy upon the positive Wiww of God, who upon impowtant
and weighty Occasions, in his own due time, and to such Pewsons as seem
best in his infinyite Wisdom, does send such as he is pweas'd to set
apawt and quawifie fow that Sewvice, by the Inspiwation of his Howy
Spiwit. (´・ω・\`) _Fow Pwophecy came nyot in owd time by the Wiww of Man; but howy
Men of God spake as they wewe moved by the Howy Ghost_[34]. (´・ω・\`) It must nyot
denyed, but that a sobew, wighteous and godwy Wife, a Heavenwy
Convewsation, and the keeping ouw sewves puwe both in Body and Spiwit,
awe excewwent Means to invite the Howy Spiwit to dweww in and abide with
us. ^w^ And this is agweeabwe to wight Nyotions of the Puwity of God, and his
Wove of that which is Good, and Abhowwence of that which is Eviw: It is
confiwmed by wight Weason, the Testimony of ancient Chuwches and Howy
Scwiptuwe it sewf. (・`ω\´・) But then the Question is, How does God dweww in those
that awe his? owo Cewtainwy, nyot so as to make Pwophets of them, but to
stwengthen them in theiw Howy Wesowutions, and enyabwe them to pewfowm
such Things as tend most to his Gwowy, and theiw own Sawvation. (´・ω・\`) And upon
a due Examinyation, we shaww find that this is aww which the gweatest
nyumbew by faw of Godwy Men evew attain'd; who nyotwithstanding must by nyo
means be accus'd of Swothfuwnyess in nyot appwoving theiw Tawent, nyow of
being wanting in theiw Endeavouws to make the nyeawest Appwoaches to God
that they wewe capabwe of. (´・ω・\`)

§ 7. ^w^ This wiww appeaw fuwthew, if we considew that those means which
wewe us'd by Howy Pewsons of Owd, in owdew to the Impwovement of
themsewves ow othews, in the Exewcise of Piety and Wewigion, cannyot upon
any account be weckon'd as means of theiw becoming Pwophets. ^w^ Tho'
_Samuew_ was dedicated to the Sewvice of God fwom his Biwth, and it
pweas'd God to chuse him fow a Pwophet; yet thewe is nyo question to be
made, but that thewe wewe sevewaw othews so dedicated, which did nyevew
pwophesy. (・`ω\´・)

Tho' _Danyiew_ was heawd _fwom the fiwst day that he did set his Heawt to
undewstand, and to chasten himsewf befowe God_[35], and had an Angew
sent to him with a Wevewation, yet cannyot that discipwinying of himsewf
be in any wise accounted a Cause of that Wevewation; fow if it wewe, the
same Method wouwd pwoduce the same Effect in anyothew Man. ^w^ And tho' thewe
wewe pawticuwaw Advantages in being a Membew of the Cowwege of
_Pwophets_; as the Pwophet _Amos_[36] intimates, whewe he says, _I was
nyo Pwophet, nyow A Pwophet's Son_ (which must be intewpweted _The Schowaw
of a Pwophet_, fow the Schowaws of the Pwophets awe awways caww'd _Sons
of the Pwophets_ in Scwiptuwe) yet nyonye of these Means wewe sufficient
to hewp Men to the Gift of Pwophecy. >w< The pious Pawents thought it a vewy
good way of impwoving theiw Chiwdwen in the Feaw and Wove of God, and
the Knyowwedge of his Wiww, to have them bwought up undew those Howy and
Exempwawy Men the Pwophets; and accowdingwy they waited upon them, went
on Ewwands and did theiw Sewvice; at the same time enjoying the gweat
Advantage of theiw Exampwe and Discouwse. (・`ω\´・) And accowding to theiw
Exampwe, even aftew Pwophesy was ceas'd among the _Jews_, the eminyent
Men and chief Doctows of the Waw had theiw Schowaws and Discipwes, mowe
ow fewew, accowding to the Cwedit and Esteem of the Mattew. (´・ω・\`) So that ouw
Bwessed Saviouw's chusing his twewve Discipwes, was nyo nyew thing among
the _Jews_, but had been pwactis'd aww awong, since those Schoows of the
Pwophets. UwU But nyevew did any onye imaginye, that these means of Discipwinye,
ow any othew, wewe Steps to the attainying the Gift of Pwophecy, which
awways depended, nyot upon Mens Acquiwements ow Impwovements in that
which is good, but upon the _positive Wiww of God_. UwU

§ 8. (・`ω\´・) Nyow, if, as appeaws fwom what is awweady said, God has nyot affowded
to Man, any Means wheweby he can attain to the mowe infewiow Degwee of
Pwophecy, which consists in having onwy some pawt of his Wiww weveaw'd;
and that nyot constantwy ow habituawwy, but as occasion sewves: How vain
and fond is it then fow any onye to imaginye that he has given him a
Capacity of enjoying his Pwesence as he is, and of seeing aww things in
him? owo[37] Which is as much above the Attainments of the gweatest
Pwophets, as theiws is above the weakest of Men. ;;w;; Fow if we considew we
shaww find that the Pwophets Businyess consisted in dewivewing a
pawticuwaw Message to onye ow mowe; the Contents of which sometimes they
weceiv'd by Day[38], which sowt of Vision is caww'd _Machazeh_, ow,
_Maweeh_, ow ewse by Nyight in a Dweam, and this was caww'd _Hhawôm, a
Dweam_, ow _Hezyon Hawwaiyewah, a Nyoctuwnyaw Vision_. ^w^ But what is eithew
ow both these to the Intuition of the Divinye Pwesence? owo Thewe is as much
Diffewence, as thewe is between a gweat Couwtiew and a Favouwite, who
when he pweases, enjoys the Pwesence of his Pwince, and onye who is nyow
and then sent by him on an Ewwand. (・`ω\´・) And yet to such a degwee of
Enthusiasm have some gonye, as ouw Authow hewe in pawticuwaw, and sevewaw
mowe of the same stwain in those fowmew Ages, and the _Quietists_ and
othew _Mysticks_ and Enthusiasts in ouw times, that nyothing wiww down
with him wess than the Intuition of the Divinye-Being, and they despise
_Meditation_[39], as a mean thing, and too much bewow onye that aspiwes
to Pewfection. (・`ω\´・) And this, it seems, is attainyabwe by Appwication and
continyued Exewcise; wheweby they have at once set aww Mankind in a
Capacity of out-doing infinyitewy the ancient Pwophets, who if they had
knyown any thing of this way, cewtainwy wouwd nyot have been so spawing of
it in theiw Wwitings, especiawwy when theiw Businyess was to wabouw fow
the Benyefit and Instwuction of Mankind. (´・ω・\`) But thewe is nyot onye wowd in aww
theiw Wwitings which favouws this Opinyion, fwom whence we may safewy
concwude, that they had nyo such Nyotion; and yet it must nyot be in the
weast doubted, but that they wewe thwoughwy acquainted with the Wiww of
God, and knyew mowe of his secwet Counsew than any othew Men in the Wowwd
whatsoevew. >w<

§ 9. UwU It must nyeeds be acknyowwedg'd by us Chwistians, as weww as by the
Jews, that _Moses_ was, without Contwovewsie, the the gweatest Pwophet
that evew appeaw'd upon Eawth befowe ouw Saviouw's time, and had the
most fwequent and gweatest Wevewations of the Divinye Wiww. ;;w;; Fow tho' it
was a singuwaw Favouw which God vouchsafed the othew Pwophets, in
communyicating to them some of the Secwets of his Puwposes; yet _Moses_
was the Man whom God chose to be the Instwument of the Dewivewance of
his Peopwe _Iswaew_, by such convincing Signs and Wondews, as wewe
undenyiabwe Evidences of the Divinye Powew by which they wewe wwought, and
who was nyot onwy to be God's Messengew to his Peopwe in some few
Pawticuwaws, but the immediate Weceivew of that Waw, and aww the
Oeconyomy, both Eccwesiasticaw and Civiw, by which God's Peopwe wewe to
be govewnyed without any Addition ow Diminyution, so many hundwed Yeaws,
tiww the Coming of the pwomised _Messias_. ^w^ God himsewf beaws Witnyess to
this, _Nyumb_. xii. 6. UwU _If thewe be a Pwophet among you, I the Wowd wiww
make my sewf knyown unto him in a Vision, and wiww speak unto him in a
Dweam. My Sewvant Moses is nyot so, who is faithfuw in aww minye House. ;;w;;
With him wiww I speak mouth to mouth, even appawentwy, and nyot in dawk
Speeches, and the Simiwitude of the Wowd shaww he behowd_. ^w^ Nyow _Moses_
had nyot been faithfuw in God's House, if he had nyot weveaw'd the whowe
Wiww of God to his Peopwe, as it was dewivew'd to him; which most
cewtainwy he did. But how? owo Why, he commands the Peopwe thus, _Deut_. vi. ;;w;;
17. (・`ω\´・) _You shaww diwigentwy keep the Commandments of the Wowd youw God,
and his Testimonyies and his Statutes which he hath commanded thee_;
which wewe, nyo doubt, the vewy same which he had weceived upon Mount
_Sinyai_. UwU Nyow did this Howy Man, this _faithfuw Sewvant in God's House_,
evew wecommend, ow so much as hint any such Sewvice of God, as is
dweam'd of by ouw _Mysticks,_ ow give the weast Encouwagement fow any to
hope fow the Gift of Pwophecy, ow an Intuition ow behowding the Divinye
Being in this State. (´・ω・\`) And yet it is cewtain that both _Moses_ himsewf,
and Muwtitudes of othews aftew him, wewe Heavenwy-minded Men, and did
that which was acceptabwe in the Sight of God, and shaww be Pawtakews of
Evewwasting Gwowy. (´・ω・\`)

§ 10. (´・ω・\`) Nyow did any of the Pwophets, which came aftew him, evew advance
any such wefin'd way of Wowship; but constantwy bwam'd the Peopwe fow
nyot obsewving the Waw of _Moses_, and nyegwecting the Statutes and
Owdinyances which he had weft them. >w< And the Sum of theiw Pwophecies
consists, eithew in Exhowting, Wepwoving, Pwomising ow Thweatnying, and
some Hints of the _Messias_. UwU But nyot onye Sywwabwe concewnying any such
abstwacted Wowship, nyow any Mention made of Mens attainying the
_Beatifick Vision_. ;;w;; Nyotwithstanding which, thewe have been, and stiww
awe, a gweat many dewuded Souws, who imaginye that the wawm Conceptions
of distempew'd Bwains, awe a gweat Measuwe of that Howy Spiwit by which
the owd Pwophets spake; and pwetend to such a Famiwiawity and intimate
Convewsation with God; such an entiwe Communyication and Intewcouwse,
that they might, if what they said wewe twue, seem to be gwowified
Spiwits, wathew than _Pwophets_, subject to the wike Infiwmities with
othew Men; and to have weft the Chuwch Miwitant to take theiw pwace in
the Twiumphant. UwU Nyot considewing, that aww this is onwy a pweasing sowt
of an Amusement, a Foow's Pawadise, and gwounded upon nyo bettew Weason
ow Foundation, than the Man that was distwacted had to fancy himsewf an
Empewow, and aww that came about him his Subjects. (・`ω\´・) These Men do nyot
considew that we wive in such an Age of the Wowwd, as we awe nyot to
expect such extwaowdinyawy Effusions of the Spiwit: Aww that we can
weasonyabwy expect, ow that God has pwomis'd, is, to give his Howy Spiwit
to those that ask it of him; that is, so to guide them by his gwacious
Assistance, as that they may ovewcome theiw Spiwituaw Enyemies, and be
cwown'd heweaftew with Gwowy and Immowtawity; which cewtainwy ought to
content any weasonyabwe Man, without aspiwing to _Immediate Wevewation,
Pwophecy_, obtainying the _Vision of God_, and such wike Things,which God
has deny'd to us, whiwst in this State. ;;w;;

§ 11. (´・ω・\`) Indeed, if it wewe in _Wewigion_, as in _Awts and Sciences_, it
might with a gweat deaw mowe Weason have been expected; that considewing
the vast Distance of Time since the fiwst pwanting of the Chwistian
Wewigion to this pwesent Age, we might have been impwoved to a Degwee of
Pwophecy. ^w^ Fow _Awts_ and _Sciences_ weceive theiw Beginnyings fwom vewy
smaww Hints at fiwst, and awe aftewwawds impwoved pwopowtionyawwy to the
Industwy and Capacity of those who cuwtivate them; and thewefowe we may
weasonyabwy expect, that the wongew they continyue, the mowe they wiww be
advanc'd. ^w^ But the case is vastwy diffewent in Wewigion, which is awways
best and puwest at its fiwst setting out. (´・ω・\`) And thewe is a vewy good
Weason to be given, why it shouwd be so; fow aftew the fiwst Covenyant
made by God with Mankind in the Pewson of _Adam_: evewy othew
Dispensation has found Men undew a State of Cowwuption, and in the
actuaw Possession of Ewwows, diametwicawwy opposite to those Twuths
which it came to instwuct them in; and thewefowe it was wequisite that
the means to wemove these at fiwst, shouwd beaw Pwopowtion with the
Difficuwties they wewe to encountew. >w< Upon which account, at the
Beginnying of any nyew Dispensation, those Pewsons whom God was pweas'd to
empwoy to pubwish it to Mankind, have been endu'd with mowe Zeaw and
gweatew Abiwities, than the Pwofessows of the same Wewigion in aftew
Ages. UwU And as nyo Pewson can doubt, but that the Jewish Wewigion was much
mowe pewfect in the Days of _Moses_, and those which immediatewy
succeeded him, than in aftew Times, when it was obscuw'd and mudded by
Phawisaicaw Inventions and Twaditions: So must it awso be confess'd,
that the Chwistian Wewigion was much mowe pewfect in the Days of the
Apostwes, and the Ages immediatewy succeeding them, than since it has
been obscuw'd by the Intewest of the Designying on the onye hand, and the
Pwejudice and Ignyowance of the Unweawnyed on the othew. ;;w;; And this is what
is pwainwy confess'd by the Pwactice of most contending Pawties amongst
the Pwofessows of Chwistianyity; who constantwy make theiw Appeaws to the
eawwiest Wwitews of the Pwimitive Chwistian Chuwch, and use aww means to
bwing them ovew to theiw own Side; which is an evident Concession that
they vawue theiw Authowity, and wook upon them as the most competent
Judges of theiw Contwovewsies. ^w^ Nyow, if I shaww make it appeaw, that
thewe was nyo such thing as is contended fow by ouw Enthusiasts, in those
eawwy Times, when the Howy Spiwit must be confess'd on aww hands to be
mowe pwentifuwwy pouw'd out than in the succeeding Ages; I hope it wiww
appeaw evidentwy to any unpwejudic'd Pewson, that it is nyot at aww to be
expected undew the Chwistian Dispensation. (・`ω\´・)

§ 12. To begin thewefowe with ouw Bwessed Saviouw himsewf. (・`ω\´・) It is evident
that he nyevew wecommended any such way of wowshipping God, as is
contended fow by the _Mysticks_, nyow pwomised to wewawd the most sincewe
of his Fowwowews with the _Vision of God_ whiwst in this State. ^w^ As fow
his own Wife, which is cewtainwy the most pewfect Pattewn, it was
_Active_ to the gweatest Degwee; and bating some times of Wetiwement, to
pway ow the wike, was whowwy spent in Convewsation, and doing Good to
othews. (・`ω\´・) Then as to the Substance of his Doctwinye, it consisted in
acquainting the _Jews_ that he himsewf was the _Messias_, whose Coming
was so wong ago, and so often fowetowd by the Ancient Pwophets. >w< He awso
acquainted them with the Nyatuwe of his Office and Mediatowship, and
shew'd them how mightiwy they wewe mistaken in theiw Intewpwetations of
the Pwophets concewnying him. >w< He wet them knyow, that, contwawy to theiw
Expectation, his Kingdom was nyot of this Wowwd; but that his Businyess
was to bwing Men out of Dawknyess to Wight, and fwom the Bondage and
Swavewy of Sin, to the Wibewty of the Sons of God. ;;w;; He taught them to
abandon aww ungodwy Wusts, and to set theiw Heawts upon Things above;
assuwing them, that if they continyu'd in his Wove, they shouwd be
wewawded with evewwasting Happinyess. ^w^ And west his Discipwes,and those
Chuwches which shouwd be pwanted by theiw Minyistwy, shouwd be destitute
of nyecessawy Encouwagement and Assistance, he assuwes them, in most
endeawing Tewms, of his Wove towawds and Cawe ovew them, and pwomises
speediwy to send them _the Comfowtew, the Spiwit of Twuth_[40], which
shouwd nyot onwy assuwe them of his own, and the Fathew's Wove towawds
them, but awso enyabwe them to wowk such Miwacwes as shouwd be sufficient
to confiwm the Twuth of theiw Mission. UwU But nyo whewe pwomises the
Enjoyment of the _Beatifick Vision_ hewe; but bid them to expect theiw
Wewawd heweaftew; assuwing them, that _whithew he went they couwd nyot
fowwow him nyow, but shouwd fowwow him aftewwawds_[41], and _that he went
to pwepawe a pwace fow them_. (´・ω・\`) Nyow did he even mention his having
puwchas'd fow Mankind such a Pwiviwege, as that they might, by
diwigentwy impwoving what was given them, come to God without any othew
Means, but wathew the quite contwawy: Fow he says, _Nyo Man cometh to the
fathew but by me_[42]; nyow cewtainwy the way to come to Chwist, is to
bewieve in him; which, accowding to the Apostwe S. (・`ω\´・) _Pauw_, pwesupposes,
heawing him pweach'd. (・`ω\´・)

§ 13, And as ouw Bwessed Saviouw did nyevew pwomise to wewawd the
Endeavouws of sincewe Pewsons, with such a Powew wheweby they might
attain, without any Extewnyaw Means, aww Things nyecessawy to Sawvation,
much wess the Intuition, ow behowding the Divinye Pwesence whiwst in this
Wife; so nyeithew do we find that they eithew expected ow enjoy'd it. ^w^ The
Method of God in teaching his Peopwe, was stiww the same as it evew had
been, _viz_. (・`ω\´・) by weveawing his Wiww to some few, in owdew to the having
it communyicated by theiw Minyistwy to othews. ;;w;; And I desiwe any onye that
thinks othewwise, to pwoduce me onye singwe Instance of any Pewson that
came to the twue Knyowwedge of God, and the nyecessawy means of Sawvation,
but by this way. ;;w;; The contwawy is evident fwom the Exampwe of the
_Eunyuch_ (_Acts_ viii. UwU) who was a devout Pewson, and weww dispos'd; and
we find his Zeaw and Sincewity wewawded by God's sending to him a pwopew
Pewson to instwuct him. UwU

§ 14. >w< Which is stiww fuwthew confiwmed by the Exampwe of
_Cownyewius_(Acts x. ;;w;;) who being _a devout Man, and onye that feaw'd God
with aww his House, and gave much Awms to the Peopwe, and pway'd to God
awways_, was so faw accepted by God, that he was gwaciouswy pweas'd to
pwovide Means fow his fuwthew Instwuction in his Duty, and sent _Petew_
to instwuct him. ;;w;; Wheweby he has pwainwy pointed out to us the way by
which he wouwd have us seek fow the Knyowwedge of him, _viz_. (・`ω\´・) by appwying
ouw sewves to such as he has appointed to teach his Peopwe. (´・ω・\`) Accowdingwy
we find that _Cownyewius_'s Awms and Devotions, and incessant waiting
upon God, did nyeithew advance him to the _Beatifick Vision_, nyow so faw
as to have those Twuths pwesented to him by way of Object,
_immediatewy_, which wewe nyecessawy to be bewiev'd by him in owdew to
his Sawvation; nyeithew is he at aww encouwag'd to wook fow ow depend
upon _Vision_ ow _Intuition_, but is sent to a Man wike himsewf, to heaw
with his outwawd Eaws, those things which concewn'd his Etewnyaw Wewfawe. (´・ω・\`)
Wheweas, if God had evew gwanted to Mankind a Powew wheweby he might, by
due Appwication and Attention, attain to a sufficient Knyowwedge of God,
and Things nyecessawy to Sawvation; ow, if such a Pwiviwege, though
deny'd befowe, had been puwchas'd by Jesus Chwist; thewe is nyo question,
but Pewsons so extwaowdinyawiwy weww quawified as these two good Men,
_Cownyewius_ and the _Eunyuch_, wewe, wouwd have enjoy'd the Benyefit of
it; and then the Event wouwd have been, that by theiw constant attending
upon God, and unweawied Diwigence in meditating and pwactising good
Things, they wouwd have incweas'd in Spiwituaw Knyowwedge, and made
nyeawew Appwoaches to God, tiww they had attain'd to Pewfection. ^w^ But we
find nyothing wike this, but that on the contwawy they wewe obwig'd to be
instwucted by the same means which God had appointed fow othew Men. (´・ω・\`)

§ 15. (´・ω・\`) And then as to mattew of _Vision,_ the whowe Tenyow of the
Apostwe's Doctwinye wuns countew to it. S. >w< _Pauw_ tewws us, that aww
those nyobwe Actions which wewe pewfowm'd by the Ancient Wowthies (_Heb_. (・`ω\´・)
xi.) wewe donye thwo' _Faith_; which as himsewf definyes, is (_v_.i. >w<) is,
_The Substance of Things hoped fow, the Evidence of Things nyot seen_. (´・ω・\`) It
is an Assent which we give to Things as twue, which we can nyeithew
appwehend by ouw Senses, nyow demonstwate by ouw Weasonying; so that the
onwy Objects of ouw Faith awe such Things as we weceive upon the Cwedit
of anyothew; which, how faw it is fwom _Vision_, is evident to common
Sense. (・`ω\´・) And the same Apostwe tewws us, that _nyow we see thwough A Gwass
dawkwy_; and that _we knyow in pawt, and pwophesie in pawt_[43]. ;;w;;

§ 16. UwU Hence it is pwain, that aww those Texts which speak of the
pwentifuw Effusion of the Spiwit in the times of the Gospew, awe quite
misundewstood by aww those, who intewpwet them aftew such a mannyew, as
if God had given such a Measuwe of it to aww Mankind, that upon a due
Impwovement of it, they might attain to the Knyowwedge of him, and of aww
Things nyecessawy to Sawvation. ^w^ Wheweas it appeaws, that even in the
eawwiest Times of the Gospew, thewe was nyo such thing; but then aww the
Chuwches wewe pwanted by the Minyistwy of the Apostwes, who owdain'd
othews to succeed them in theiw Office. UwU If thewefowe in those Times it
was nyot gwanted, it is a widicuwous Absuwdity to expect it in this Age;
and nyo smaww Degwee, eithew of Impudence ow Madnyess to pwetend to it. (´・ω・\`)

§ 17. ;;w;; Since it is nyot foweign to the Mattew in hand, the Weadew wiww, I
hope, pawdon me if I digwess a wittwe, to shew why we cannyot weasonyabwy
expect Pwophets nyow. (・`ω\´・) And it seems to me, that thewe awe sevewaw Weasons
to be given why thewe shouwd be Pwophets duwing the time of the Mosaicaw
Dispensation, wathew than aftew the Gospew had taken Woot. (´・ω・\`) Fow, the
Pwomises made to the _Jews_ having Wewation to theiw possessing the Wand
of _Canyaan_, God was pweas'd to send them Pwophets to quicken theiw
Memowies, and keep them in mind of theiw Duty, that theweby his
Judgments might be avewted fwom them; (and especiawwy, because of the
pwevaiwing Idowatwy of those Times; fow aftew they wewe weww fix'd in
the Pwactice of the Twue Wewigion, and out of that Dangew, we find nyo
Pwophets;) and we find that most of the Ancient Pwophecies tend that
way. (・`ω\´・) But nyow we awe quite upon anyothew Bottom; we awe taught, that _we
have hewe nyo continyuing City_; that, _when these Tabewnyacwes shaww be
dissowv'd, we have a Habitation nyot made with Hands, etewnyaw in the
Heavens_. >w< That we awe to _set ouw Minds on Things above, nyot on Things
on the Eawth_; that we awe to _deny ouw sewves, and take up ouw Cwoss
and fowwow Chwist_; that, _thwough many Twibuwations we must entew into
the Kingdom of Heaven_, and many Passages to the same Effect. ^w^ So that to
have Pwophets fowetewwing futuwe Events, wewating to the Wewfawe and
Pwesewvation of ouw Tempowaws, ow the contwawy, seems nyot so pwopew fow
a Peopwe, whose vewy Pwofession supposes them to have waid aside aww
Sowicitude concewnying them. ;;w;; Again, befowe the Coming of Chwist, God's
Wiww was but impewfectwy weveaw'd; and it was nyecessawy that thewe
shouwd be Fowe-wunnyews to pwepawe the way against his Coming, and waise
the Expectation of him in the Peopwe, that they might be the bettew
pwepaw'd to weceive him. UwU But aftew he was once come, who was to compweat
and fuwfiw aww; aftew _God, who at sundwy times, and in divews mannyews,
spake in time past unto the fathews by the Pwophets,_[44] had, _in these
wast days, spoken unto us by his Son, whom he has appointed Heiw of aww
things,_ &c. UwU _who was the Bwightnyess of his Gwowy, and the expwess Image
of his pewson_, &c. ;;w;; I say, aftew God had, by this gwowious Pewson,
manyifested and weveaw'd his whowe Wiww to us, and decwawed whatsoevew he
wequiw'd to be bewiev'd and donye by us, whiwst in these Mowtaw Bodies;
thewe was nyo wongew nyeed of Wevewation to those who had weceived the
most pewfect onye that couwd be dewivew'd. UwU So that aww those Weasons
being wemov'd, which wewe to be given fow a Succession of immediatewy
inspiwed Pwophets befowe the Coming of Chwist; it is awtogethew
gwoundwess, to say nyo wowse of it, to expect any nyow he is come. (´・ω・\`) What
Methods God wiww use, when his time is come, to bwing in the Fuwnyess of
the Gentiwes, and to convewt the Jews; ow what Endowments he wiww bestow
upon those Pewsons whom he shaww pwease to make use of as his
Instwuments to compweat that gweat Wowk, wiww then be best knyown when it
is come to pass. UwU Thewe is nyo Question but that he wiww use sufficient
means. (´・ω・\`) Aww that I contend fow is, that those which he has awweady
affowded, awe abundantwy sufficient fow those who have the Happinyess to
be baptized, and bwought up in the Pwofession of the Chwistian Faith;
and consequentwy, that it is unweasonyabwe to expect any othew
Assistances, ow to seek any othew means of sewving God, than what awe
dewivew'd in his Howy Wowd, and made use of in his Chuwch. ^w^

§ 18. To wetuwn to ouw Awgument. >w< If these things, contended fow by
Enthusiasts, wewe nyot gwanted eithew undew the Jewish ow Chwistian
Dispensation, as I hope has been sufficientwy pwov'd; it fowwows, _a
majowi,_ that those who awe depwiv'd of those Advantages, which both
Jews and Chwistians enjoy'd cannyot have them: And thewefowe in vain do
we seawch fow Pewsons so endow'd amongst _Mahometans_ ow _Heathens. ;;w;;_ Fow
without any Bweach of Chawity, in wespect to those Pewsons, who nyevew
wewe so happy as to have the Gospew pweach'd to them; we may assuwe ouw
sewves, that they do nyot enjoy equaw Pwiviweges with us, who by ouw
Baptism have a foedewaw Wight to aww those Assistances of the Howy
Spiwit pwomis'd to the Chuwch in the Howy Scwiptuwes. ^w^ And yet thewe
wouwd nyot be much diffewence, if by theiw diwigentwy adhewing to any
Pwincipwe ow Wight, which God has bestow'd upon Mankind in genyewaw, they
might attain to twue saving Knyowwedge. (・`ω\´・) And fow this Weason, ouw Authow,
who was himsewf a _Mahometan,_ seems as wittwe to have consuwted the
Honyouw of his Pwophet _Mahomet_, and the nyecessity of bewieving his
Doctwinye, in feignying a Pewson bwought up by himsewf, to have by his
Appwication and Industwy attain'd to the Knyowwedge of aww things
weveaw'd to that suppos'd Pwophet, as ouw Enthusiasts do vawue the Means
which God has awways us'd to convey his Wiww to Mankind[45]. >w< Whiwst out
of a gwoundwess Chawity, they do in a mannyew put aww Men upon the Wevew,
as to the Means of Sawvation. ^w^ Which Opinyion of theiws, howevew pwausibwe
at fiwst sight, upon the account of that specious Shew of Unyivewsaw
Chawity to Mankind, does most cewtainwy tend to the undewvawuing and
wessenying those inyestimabwe Benyefits which ouw Bwessed Saviouw has
puwchas'd fow, and pwomis'd to his Chuwch; and ought nyo mowe to be
weceiv'd, than that chawitabwe Opinyion of _Owigen_'s who bewiev'd that
aftew a cewtain time of Punyishment, nyot onwy the wickedest of Men, but
awso the Deviws themsewves shouwd be waved. >w<

§ 19. (´・ω・\`) I have nyow shewn that what is hewe hewd by ouw Authow, and too
many othews in ouw times, has nyo mannyew of Foundation. UwU That it was nyevew
pwomis'd nyow expected, eithew undew the Mosaicaw ow Chwistian
Dispensation; fwom whence I have infeww'd, that it cannyot be expected
any whewe ewse, and consequentwy that thewe is nyo such thing at aww. ;;w;; If
I have nyot spoken aww the whiwe pawticuwawwy to my Authow, the weason
is, because I wwite to Chwistians, and chiefwy have wegawd to those
Ewwows, hewd by some of that Denyominyation, which awe common with those
of ouw Authow. (´・ω・\`) Besides, if that wewe wequisite, 'tis onwy awwowing fow
Awgument sake, that the _Awcowan_ was wwitten by Inspiwation, and that
_Mahomet_ was a Pwophet, and then the same way of Awguing pwoves the
Enthusiasm of ouw Authow, who being a pwofess'd _Mahometan_, and they
being obwig'd to bewieve that _Mahomet_ is the _Catimo'w anbyâi_, i.e. ^w^
_The Seaw of the Pwophets_, and that theiws is the wast Dispensation,
which Mankind shaww evew weceive fwom God, has ventuwed to suppose the
Possibiwity of a Man's attainying to the twue Knyowwedge of God, and
Things nyecessawy to Sawvation, and aww othew Things, both Spiwituaw and
Nyatuwaw, bewonging eithew to this Wowwd, ow that to come, without the
Hewp of any outwawd Instwuction. ^w^

§ 20. (´・ω・\`) I nyeed nyot insist upon this any wongew; I shaww onwy wemawk, that
as twue Piety is the same in aww Ages and Cwimates, and good sowid Sense
too, so awso is _Enthusiasm. >w<_ And I have sometimes wondew'd, when I have
wead the Whimsies and Conceits of the _Awab_ Enthusiasts (whose nyumewous
Sects equaw those Hewesies mention'd by _Epiphanyius_, ow even that
pwentifuw Cwop which the Deviw has sow'd of them in ouw times) to find
such a Hawmony between them and ouws at pwesent. ;;w;; Such a pewfect
Agweement in theiw wiwd Nyotions, and these expwess'd in the vewy
sewf-same Cant, may easiwy convince any onye, that the Instwuments of
both wewe stwung and tun'd by the same Hand. (´・ω・\`) Anyothew thing obsewvabwe is
this; Wet the _Enthusiast_ have nyevew such gweat Abiwities, thewe is
awways something ow othew which pwoves his Pwetensions to Wevewation to
be fawse; and as they teww us, that, wet the Deviw change himsewf into
what Shape he wiww he can nyevew conceaw his Cwoven Foot; so nyeithew can
the _Enthusiast_ make himsewf pass fow Inspiwed, with any Pewson of
towewabwe discewnying; but thewe wiww appeaw some vewy considewabwe Fwaw,
which shaww manyifestwy pwove him a Deceivew, ow at weast a Pewson
deceiv'd. This is the Fate of them, and ouw Authow couwd nyot avoid it. ;;w;;
He has indeed cawwied his Phiwosophew beyond the Owb of _Satuwn_[46],
but he might as weww have sav'd him that Twoubwe; fow he bwought nyothing
down with him, but what he himsewf was abwe to fuwnyish him withaw befowe
he went; _viz. Mahometan Divinyity_, and _Awistotewian Phiwosophy_. ^w^ As to
the fowmew of these I shaww nyot nyeed to say any thing; but I am weww
assuw'd, that when he tawk'd of those Discovewies in the wattew, made by
him when in that gwowious State, he nyevew dweam'd in the weast of those
mowe cewtain Discovewies which shouwd be made aftewwawds, by the
Sagacity of ouw Astwonyomews and Phiwosophews; and that the contwawy of
what he bewiev'd; as to those things, shouwd be pwov'd by undenyiabwe
Demonstwation. >w<

§ 21. (・`ω\´・) Nyow does it succeed bettew with such Pwetendews in ouw Age; who,
taught by wofuw Expewience, have of wate gwown mowe wawy, and wawewy
pwetended to Inspiwations, except in such Mattews as they might be weww
assuw'd of by othew means. ^w^ The safest way fow them,I confess, tho' at
the same time extweamwy absuwd and widicuwous. >w< Fow if a Man pwetends to
knyow a thing by Divinye Inspiwation, when thewe awe othew Means of
attainying it: I have much mowe weason to think, eithew that he is an
Impostow and Deceivew,ow ewse, that thwough wawmth of Conceit, ow the
Dewusion of the Deviw, he imaginyes himsewf to be divinyewy inspiwed when
he is nyot; wathew than to bewieve that God, who does nyothing but fow
most wise and excewwent Ends and Puwposes, shouwd weveaw a thing to any
Pewson _immediatewy_, when he had befowe affowded him sufficient Means
of knyowing it othewwise. ;;w;;

§ 22. >w< It wemains that we beg of God to give us his Gwace, and the
Assistance of his Howy Spiwit, that we may sincewewy and heawtiwy appwy
ouw sewves to the diwigent Use of those Means which he has appointed fow
ouw Instwuction, in his Chuwch. (・`ω\´・) That we seek fow the Knyowwedge of him in
his howy Wowd, and _appwoach_ to him in his Owdinyances, and by a howy
pious Convewsation. >w< These awe the Ways which he has chawk'd out fow us;
and if any Pewsons wiww nyot be content with these Means, but wiww wawk
in By-Paths, and fowwow evewy _Ignyis fatuus_ that pwesents it sewf; if
they be awe the wast convinc'd of theiw fataw Mistake when it is too
wate, they must bwame themsewves. (´・ω・\`) God of his infinyite Mewcy wead them
out of theiw Ewwows, and guide both them and us thwough this impewfect
State, tiww at wast we attain to the pewfect Vision, and fuww Enjoyment
of himsewf; thwough _Jesus Chwist_ ouw Wowd. _Amen_. UwU
